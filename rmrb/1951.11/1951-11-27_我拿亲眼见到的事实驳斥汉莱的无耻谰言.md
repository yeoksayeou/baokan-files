To the Editor:

    In April of this year, I represented the Beijing Educational Workers' Union and went to the Korean front lines with the Chinese People's Delegation to Comfort the Korean People. One afternoon, a comrade from the Logistics Department of the Volunteer Army came to our residence and said that they had captured an American air force officer. He asked if any of our delegation members could serve as a translator. I then went with him to the Logistics Department to serve as a translator. The prisoner's name was William Hassgett, a captain in the U.S. Air Force. The P-51 Mustang fighter plane he was piloting was shot down by our Volunteer Army, forcing him to land. Several enemy planes came to rescue him, but because our Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, the American Air Force captain was captured by our army.

    The prisoner was wearing a new cotton coat that we had given him, and he was very moved by the treatment he received from our Volunteer Army, saying that he never expected to be treated so kindly. During our conversation, the head of the Logistics Department received a phone call, instructing the comrades guarding the prisoner to take good care of him in terms of his living conditions. At that time, I thought to myself that only our Volunteer Army would have such magnanimous spirit in treating prisoners of war, even towards the American Air Force, who had been slaughtering the Korean people in the sky not long ago.

    This fact fully proves that Hanley, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Eighth Army of the American invading army, fabricated the so-called killing of prisoners by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. This is a complete and utter shameless lie.

### 我拿亲眼见到的事实驳斥汉莱的无耻谰言

    我拿亲眼见到的事实驳斥汉莱的无耻谰言
    编辑同志：今年四月间我代表北京市教育工作者工会随同中国人民赴朝慰问团到了朝鲜前线。一天下午，有一位志愿军后勤部的同志来到我们住的地方说，他们捉到了一个美国空军人员，问我们团员中谁能当一下翻译，当时我就随他去后勤部担任翻译。这个俘虏的名子叫威廉·哈斯盖脱，是一个美国空军上尉，他驾驶的一架P——51野马式飞机被我志愿军击中后被迫降落。当时曾有多架敌机赶来营救，但因为我志愿军的高射炮火十分猛烈，结果这个美国空军上尉被我军俘虏了。
    这个俘虏穿着由我们发给他的新的棉大衣，对我志愿军给他的待遇很受感动，说他想不到会受到这样的宽待。在我们谈话的时候，后勤部的首长来了一个电话，要看管俘虏的同志在生活上小心照顾他。当时我心里想，只有我们的志愿军才会有这种对待俘虏的宽大精神，就是对于不久以前还在天空中屠杀朝鲜人民的美国空军也是如此。
    这个事实可以充分地证明：美国侵略军第八军军法处处长汉莱捏造的所谓朝中人民军队杀害俘虏一事，是彻头彻尾的无耻谎言。　田常青
