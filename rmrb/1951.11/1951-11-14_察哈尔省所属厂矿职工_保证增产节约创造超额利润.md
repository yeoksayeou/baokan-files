　　Factory and Mine Workers in Chahar Province
    Guarantee Increased Production and Savings to Create Super Profits
    Comrade Editor: The Industry Department and Trade Union of Chahar Province jointly held the Provincial Advanced Production Experience Exchange Conference from October 25th to 29th. During the meeting, the representatives unanimously understood the basic spirit of Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. After discussions at the conference, the representatives of factory and mine workers in Datong City proposed a guarantee to create super profits equivalent to three fighter planes for the country in the fourth quarter's patriotic production increase and thrift movement. The main method of this guarantee is: in production, all coal mines guarantee to overproduce 200,000 tons of coal. Representatives from factories in Zhangjiakou City guaranteed to respond to Chairman Mao's call with super profits equivalent to two fighter planes in the fourth quarter. The specific methods are: a machinery factory in Zhangjiakou guarantees to further reduce the cost of machinery, overfulfill the task of three vehicles, and save the country 2 billion yuan in the whole quarter; Zhangyuan Electric Factory guarantees super profits of 350 million yuan and strives to reach 700 million yuan. Representatives from factories and mines in Xuanhua City proposed: to guarantee super profits of 2 million catties of millet in the fourth quarter to respond to this patriotic production increase and thrift movement, such as a paper mill changing the labor organization and implementing a three-and-a-half shift system, which can save 400,000 catties of millet in the whole quarter.
