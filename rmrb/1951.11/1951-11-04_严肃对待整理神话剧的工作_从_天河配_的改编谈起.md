    Seriously Treat the Work of Reorganizing Mythological Dramas
    ——Starting with the Adaptation of "The Celestial River Romance"
    Ma Shaobo
    In the work of opera reform, many performers and even cadres confuse mythology with superstition. Some troupes stage superstitious and monstrous plays such as "Investigating Yin Mountain," "Guan Gong's Manifestation," and "The Complete Investiture of the Gods," mistakenly treating them as "mythological plays," allowing superstition to harm the audience under the guise of mythology. Some even mistakenly believe that "having gods speak" is "mythology." Some troupes, when performing mythological plays, fail to seriously modify the superstitious elements. Some troupes treat mythological plays such as "The Legend of the White Snake" and "Havoc in Heaven" as superstitious plays and forcibly stop their performances. In the adaptation of mythological dramas, some comrades have made considerable efforts, but some deviations have also occurred.

    First, is to modernize mythology and use mythology to insinuate modern struggles. For example, some people write "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," using Elder Zhengli (Elder Truth) who, based on scientific principles, cultivates scythes and axes, teaches the Cowherd and Weaver Girl to labor, and gives them tools to promote labor creating the world. Using oxen to symbolize tractors, magpies to represent peace birds, and including many contents such as learning the history of social development, the rice stem borer elimination campaign, opposition to American imperialist aggression, and land reform propaganda. Or changing magpies to peace doves, interspersing the struggle between peace doves and owls to insinuate the current international situation. Another example is the "Hundred Flowers Garden" performed by a certain Shandong troupe, comparing the gods of the Hundred Flowers Garden to the Chinese people; the gods of the Eastern Bamboo Forest to the Korean people; and the goblins led by Pig Old America to American imperialism. The story of the immortals congratulating the Old Man of Hundred Flowers on his birthday, with Pig Old America transforming into human form and sneaking into the celebration as an internal spy, but being exposed by the immortals, is used to imply the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; Pig Old America leading the monsters to invade the Eastern Bamboo Forest, and the immortals of the Hundred Flowers Garden helping the Eastern Bamboo Forest to defeat him, implies resisting America and aiding Korea. When the Eastern Bamboo Forest sent people to the Hundred Flowers Garden for help, two immortals in the Hundred Flowers Garden had a fierce debate about whether to provide assistance; after Pig Old America was defeated, he came up with a delaying tactic, sending a monster to negotiate, with lines such as "drawing a line as a boundary, mutually keeping faith," insinuating the "38th parallel as the boundary." In the end, the negotiations failed, and they fought, with the immortals defeating Pig Old America, ending the play. Some adopt the feudal ruling class's distorted and falsified accounts of folk myths and then make inappropriate elaborations. For example, someone in Shanghai, based on the "Jingchu Chronicles" which states: "East of the Milky Way is the Weaver Girl, the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor; she weaves diligently year after year, weaving brocade robes. The Heavenly Emperor, pitying her loneliness, allowed her to marry the Cowherd west of the river. After marriage, she abandoned weaving. The Heavenly Emperor was angry and ordered her to return east of the river, allowing them to meet once a year," wrote a play in which the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, in order to strengthen their labor concept, similar to a patriotic pact, meet once a year completely out of their own free will, supposedly to inspire the production enthusiasm of modern people and accelerate the resistance against America and aid to Korea. This is a destruction of mythology as a national tradition, and also a distortion of the real struggle.

    On the other hand, some correctly maintain the original mythology but fail to analyze and select the positive and negative factors, to develop its positive, i.e., democratic essence, and discard its negative, i.e., feudal dross. As a result, it lacks the power of education and encouragement. For example, the "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" script adapted by Comrade Wu Zuguang, although greatly improved compared to the old version and considered the best among all the newly adapted "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" scripts, still retains the vulgar elements of the old "Celestial River Romance"; moreover, the characters of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, as symbols of young laborers, are treated as too weak and powerless, lacking the spirit of resistance and struggle, reducing the positive significance of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl myth.

    Undoubtedly, the above situations are damaging to the beautiful and healthy folk myths. The reason for this is that the authors lack a historical materialist perspective and a serious attitude towards the work of organizing mythology.

    As we all know, mythology is a product of mankind's infancy, a bold exploration by ancient people of natural phenomena out of a strong sense of curiosity, such as the movement of the sun and moon, the appearance and disappearance of stars, the changes of mountains, rivers, seas, wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, the growth and death of plants, flowers, birds, beasts, insects, and fish, resulting in a naive explanation and beautiful imagination; even the experiences, ideals, and grievances in the social life and struggles of the time were often寓于mythical legends. Every nation in the world has its own myths of the early people, and the materials of Chinese mythology—although only some fragments—are hidden in folk tales and scattered in many ancient books, becoming a colorful part of ancient Chinese literature and oral literature. For example, the story of "Nuwa Mending the Sky": "In ancient times, the four poles collapsed, the nine provinces were cracked, the sky did not cover everything, and the earth did not support everything; the fire burned without ceasing, the water flowed without stopping; fierce beasts ate the common people, and birds of prey snatched the old and the young. Therefore, Nuwa smelted five-colored stones to mend the blue sky, cut off the feet of the tortoise to establish the four poles, killed the black dragon to save Jizhou, and accumulated reed ash to stop the excessive water. The blue sky was mended, the four poles were corrected, the excessive water dried up, Jizhou was pacified, cunning insects died, and the common people lived." (See "Huainanzi, Lanmingxun") How vast the imagination of ancient people is expressed in this flood myth! How powerful the魄力 and courage to transform the world! Compared with the Nordic myth that "the god Odin killed the ice giant Ymir and used his skull to create the sky, and then had four of the strongest dwarves stand at the four corners of the earth to hold up the sky and prevent it from collapsing," it is not only an interesting coincidence, but also in no way inferior! Other myths such as "Yu the Great Taming the Flood," "Lu Ban Building Bridges," "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," "Legend of the White Snake," and "Sun Wukong's Havoc in Heaven" are all so healthy and beautiful! Although the exploration of the secrets of the universe by ancient people seems very naive and laughable today, and utterly absurd when measured by the standards of natural science, in ancient times, all these naive explanations and imaginations showed the amazing wisdom of mankind's infancy! Seeing the achievements of modern science in flight, we cannot but respect our ancestors when they attempted to defeat wild beasts, and the fantasy of growing wings or riding clouds and mist to fly in the sky. Therefore, when revising or writing scripts, we must pay attention to distinguishing between superstition and mythology, because mythology is mostly the naive fantasy of ancient people about natural phenomena, or a protest against human society and a pursuit of an ideal world. Such mythology is not only harmless but also beneficial.

    The reason why superstitious plays or some superstitious elements in plays should be negated is that they promote fatalism and give people the poison of superstition. The arrangements of the feudal ruling class regarding the underworld and cyclical retribution are strictly different in essence from the simple and pure folk myths. In particular, it is necessary to oppose terrifying and anesthetizing the people through theatrical performances, inducing them to believe in fate, to submit ideologically, and to resign themselves to fate. The old play "Slippery Oil Mountain" is one of the worst examples.

    In old plays, some scripts are mixed with mythology and superstition, which requires careful distinction. For example, although Peking Opera "The Lotus Lantern" (including "Splitting the Mountain to Save Mother") contains some supernatural and superstitious elements, the basic content writes about social and family problems. Precisely because of this, "Sacrificing the Son" and "Interrogation" are still popular. The entire "Splitting the Mountain to Save Mother" can be changed into a mythological play against feudal oppression if the superstitious parts are removed. Just imagine how strongly it reflects feudal oppression to imprison an innocent woman alive behind Mount Hua! And how the younger generation can split a mountain thousands of feet high to save suffering, symbolizing the strong fighting will of the Chinese people! The Yue Opera "The Lotus Lantern" recently performed in Beijing, although it still has some shortcomings, is basically a relatively successful attempt.

    The reason why mythology or the mythological elements in some plays should be affirmed is that they express the voice of the people, explaining a positive idea to the people through a form similar to gods and monsters. Such as "Flame Mountain" and "Havoc in Heaven" for resisting feudal rule, "Legend of the White Snake," "Celestial River Romance," and "The Story of Liu Yi" for opposing feudal ideas, and "Mr. Dong Guo and the Wolf" for criticizing unprincipled love. In the old society, the reactionary class did not allow the people to speak reason and understand reason, so many grievances were often expressed through the mythological form.

    Some plays are not entirely mythology but have a little mythological element, which is often mistaken for "superstition." For example, the twin butterflies in "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" are mythology, not superstition. Because this is only through the incarnation of Liang and Zhu, "flying wing to wing," to symbolize the protest against feudal oppression, just like the folk tale of the "Cuckoo," both express the people's fighting will and are brilliant national artistic achievements, and should not be regarded as superstition.

    Mythology and folk tales are not the same thing. Organizing folk myths or legends should not harm the beautiful plots and pure imagination, but should fully develop their positive factors and discard their negative factors to make them healthier and more beautiful. This is by no means "mythology for mythology" or "art for art's sake." This also has a principled difference from the "modernization" of mythology.

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, in his article "On the Harmfulness of Literature for Literature and Art for Art" (published in this newspaper on November 3), denied the above view. He believes that mythology can be used to insinuate reality, reflect the resistance to America and aid to Korea, and defend world peace, etc., and vigorously advocates this. I think it is inappropriate. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan even believes that opposing the use of mythology to reflect resistance to America and aid to Korea is opposing resistance to America and aid to Korea, and is speaking for Truman, which is completely unreasonable! This is very simple common sense. For example, when we write works on resisting America and aiding Korea, opposing simply scolding the enemy as turtles, opposing using abuse instead of fighting, to correct our creative attitude and correctly use literary and artistic weapons, isn't it to strengthen the fight! Is this really "hitting the revolution and benefiting the enemy" as Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said? Is this really, as Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said, that not using mythology to reflect resistance to America and aid to Korea is "aiding the enemy" and "not allowing to touch the imperialist Truman at all"? It's just that a little criticism was made of your work, and even to push your comrades to the enemy's side, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's unreasonable attitude is very wrong!

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan cited the example of Chairman Mao using the metaphor of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" in a certain speech. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said: "In this myth, the Foolish Old Man wanted to remove Mount Taihang and Mount Wangwu. Chairman Mao said: 'We want to remove these two mountains: one is the mountain of feudalism, and the other is the mountain of imperialism.' Isn't this 'using mythology to insinuate reality'?" Is Chairman Mao using metaphors in his speech "using mythology to insinuate reality"? We believe this is using fables to explain reality, just as Lenin and Stalin often borrowed the help of artistic literature to strengthen their arguments and give them vividness, which is the so-called "reasoning and writing, no metaphor, no awakening." Taking the fable of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" as an example to illustrate the indomitable will of the working people to transform the world, this is completely different from Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's "theory" of using mythology to reflect resistance to America and aid to Korea. What is the similarity between them? When we literary and artistic workers go deep into the masses and experience life, we often use "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs" as a metaphor for determination. If we compile a script, are we allowed to compare tigers to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and compare tiger dens to factories, rural areas, and troops! This incorrect defense completely proves the confusion in Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's thinking. Using history to insinuate the modern is already impermissible, let alone mythology! It is said that some comrades said this: "What's wrong with using history to insinuate the modern? Mr. Lu Xun's 'Old Tales Retold' and Mr. Guo Moruo's 'Qu Yuan' are not all insinuating the modern?" This statement is completely wrong. This does not take into account what era Mr. Lu Xun wrote "Old Tales Retold" and Mr. Guo Moruo wrote "Qu Yuan"! What era is it now! Did Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Guo Moruo not understand historical science? No, they understood historical science more than we do. At that time, they were under the rule of dark forces, without freedom of speech, and it was very difficult to openly promote revolutionary ideas. Obviously, they wrote historical stories and historical scripts as one of the ways to fight the enemy in the historical environment at that time. The purpose was not to write history, but to borrow history to reveal a glimmer of sunshine, which is completely understandable. Even in the past, the "comic relief" in opera performances, with its joy, anger, and mockery of current politics and customs, had a certain progressive significance; but today, in the People's Republic of China, which gives revolutionary artists full democratic freedom, but does not give democratic freedom to counter-revolutionary secret agents, what is the need for obscure twists and turns to promote revolutionary ideas? Does anyone restrict you from promoting resistance to America and aid to Korea! Then what reason must there be to borrow history to insinuate resistance to America and aid to Korea, to borrow "comic relief" to promote resistance to America and aid to Korea? What reason must there be to borrow mythology to reflect resistance to America and aid to Korea in a roundabout way! Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said: "Now there is a saying: 'Write about resisting America and aiding Korea, just write about resisting America and aiding Korea, why must it be written in mythology?' It has now been proven that this is incorrect." We advocate correctly and truthfully reflecting resistance to America and aid to Korea, opposing distorting resistance to America and aid to Korea with mythology, isn't it correct! Facts prove: the one who is wrong is not someone else, but Comrade Yang Shaoxuan himself.

    To seriously treat the work of organizing mythological dramas, we must oppose modernizing mythology; we must determine better mythological drama repertoires and systematically organize and stage them, overcoming and preventing the phenomenon of superstitious and monstrous plays being staged arbitrarily in the name of mythology. On the other hand, it is even more important that opera workers must concentrate their main energy on expressing modern themes and not regard compiling and performing mythological plays as a way to escape reality. There are many themes with realistic educational significance in China's rich historical events, such as the historical themes of peasant revolutions. In particular, the themes of modern people's struggles are even more abundant. This should be used as the main source to create people's opera and adhere to the correct direction of people's drama creation.

    严肃对待整理神话剧的工作
    ——从“天河配”的改编谈起
    马少波
    在戏曲改革工作中，不少艺人以至干部把神话和迷信混为一谈。有的剧团把“探阴山”、“关公显圣”、“连台封神榜”等迷信神怪的戏，错当作“神话戏”演出，一任迷信戏假神话之名贻害观众，甚至有人错误地认为“有神说话”就是“神话”；有的剧团演出神话戏，未能把神话戏中的迷信成分认真加以修改；有的剧团把“白蛇传”、“闹天宫”等神话戏当做迷信戏，强令停演。在神话剧的改编工作方面，有些同志虽作了不少努力，但也发生了一些偏差。
    首先，是把神话现代化，用神话影射现代斗争。例如有人写“牛郎织女”，以郑里老人（真理老人）根据了科学法则，修炼镰刀斧头，教导牛郎织女劳动，送给他们工具等情节来宣传劳动创造世界。用耕牛象征拖拉机，喜鹊代表和平鸟，并将社会发展史的学习、治螟运动、反对美帝国主义侵略、土地改革宣传等许多内容都包括在内。或者将喜鹊改为和平鸽，穿插了和平鸽与鸱枭之争，用以影射目前国际形势。再如山东某剧团演出的“百花园”，以百花园的神比拟中国人民；东竹林的神比拟朝鲜人民；以猪老美为首的精怪，比拟美帝国主义。并以众仙给百花老人祝寿，猪老美幻变人形混进寿堂作为内奸，结果被众仙识破，隐喻镇压反革命；以猪老美率领众怪进扰东竹林，百花园的众仙援助东竹林将他打败，隐喻抗美援朝；当东竹林派人向百花园求援时，百花园还有两位仙人对援助与否展开了激烈的争论；猪老美被击败之后，又来了一个缓兵之计，派一个妖怪出面谈和，谈判中有“划线为界、互守信约”的台词，隐喻“三八线为界”。最后谈判不成，开打，众仙战败猪老美，闭幕。有的袭用封建统治阶级对于民间神话的纂改歪曲的说法，再加以不恰当的发挥，如上海有人根据“荆楚岁时记”所载：“天河之东有织女，天帝之子也；年年织杼劳役，织成云锦天衣。天帝怜其独处，许嫁河西牵牛郎。嫁后遂废织絍。天帝怒，责令归河东。使其一年一度相会”的故事编剧，竟写成牛郎织女为了加强劳动观念，类似爱国公约的性质，夫妻每年相会一次，完全出于自觉自愿，据说以此鼓舞今人的生产热情，加紧抗美援朝。这是对于作为民族传统的神话的一种破坏，同时也是对现实斗争的一种歪曲。
    另一方面，是正确地保持了原来的神话，但却没有对其中的积极的与消极的因素，加以分析、选择，发挥其积极的，亦即民主精华的因素；而抛弃其消极的，亦即封建糟粕的因素。其结果缺乏教育和鼓舞的力量。例如吴祖光同志改编的“牛郎织女”剧本，虽然比旧本有了很大的改进，在所有新编的“牛郎织女”剧本中算是比较好的，但仍然残留了“天河配”旧剧的庸俗成分；而且把作为青年劳动者象征的牛郎织女的性格处理得过于软弱无力，缺乏反抗斗争的精神，减低了牛郎织女神话的积极意义。
    无疑的，以上这些情况，对于美丽健康的民间神话，是一种损害。所以这样，是由于作者对神话整理工作缺乏历史唯物主义的观点与缺乏严肃的态度。
    如众周知，神话是人类幼年期的产物，是古代人民对于自然现象出于强烈的好奇心理的一种大胆的探求，如对日月的进行，星辰的出没，山川河海风云雷雨的变幻，草木花卉鸟兽虫鱼的生长与死亡，所产生的一种天真的解释和美丽的想像；乃至当时社会生活斗争中的经验、理想和不平之鸣，也多寓于神话传说。世界各民族都各自有其初民的神话，中国神话的材料——虽然只是一些片断的材料——蕴藏于民间传说及散见于古籍的很多，成为中国古代文学口头文学中色彩鲜艳的部分。例如“女娲补天”的故事：“往古之时，四极废，九州裂，天不兼覆，地不周载；火爁炎而不灭，水浩洋而不息；猛兽食颛民，鸷鸟攫老幼，于是女娲炼五色石以补苍天，断鳌足以立四极，杀黑龙以济冀州，积芦灰以止淫水；苍天补，四极正，淫水涸，冀州平，狡虫死，颛民生。”（见“淮南子、览冥训”）这一段洪水神话表现古代人民的想像够多么辽阔！改造世界的魄力和胆量够多么强大！比起北欧神话所说的“神奥定杀死了冰巨人伊密尔以后，将他的头盖骨造成了天，又使四个最强壮的矮人立于地之四角，撑住了天，不让天崩坠下来”的故事，不仅是很有趣味的巧合，而且是毫无逊色！再如“大禹治水”、“鲁班造桥”、“嫦娥奔月”、“牛郎织女”、“白蛇传”、“孙悟空大闹天宫”等等神话，都是多么健康而美丽！虽然古代人民对于宇宙秘密的探求，今天看起来十分幼稚可笑，以自然科学的尺度去测量，简直是荒诞不经；但是在远古时代，这一切天真的解释和想像，却表现了人类幼年期的惊人的智慧！我们看到近代科学上飞行的成就，不能不尊重我们的祖先当他们企图战胜野兽的时候，所发生的长了翅膀或驾云腾雾在天空中飞行的幻想。因此，在修改或编写剧本时必须注意区别迷信与神话，因为神话大都是古代人民对于自然现象之天真的幻想，或对人间社会的一种抗议和对理想世界的追求，这种神话非但无害，而且是有益的。
    迷信戏或者有些戏的迷信成分所以应该否定，就是因为它是宣扬宿命论，给人民以迷信的毒素。封建统治阶级关于阴曹地府循环报应的安排，与古朴纯真的民间神话，是有着严格的本质的区别的。特别是通过戏剧表演来恐吓和麻醉人民，诱迫人民相信命运，从思想上就范，听天由命，是应该反对的，旧剧“滑油山”就是最坏的典型之一。
    在旧剧里，有些剧本是神话和迷信夹杂在一起的，这需要加以缜密的区别。如京剧“宝莲灯”（包括“劈山救母”）虽然其中包含一些神怪迷信成分，但基本内容却写出了社会问题和家庭问题，正因如此，现在“舍子”、“打堂”还在流行。整个“劈山救母”如把迷信部分删除，可以改成一个反封建压迫的神话戏的。试想把一个无辜的女人活活地压在华山背后，对于封建压迫是多么强烈的写照！而青年一代可以把高达千仞的山岭劈开，拯救苦难，又如何象征着中国人民坚强的斗争意志！最近在京演出的越剧“宝莲灯”，虽然还有若干缺点，基本上是一个比较成功的尝试。
    神话或者有些戏的神话成分之所以应该肯定，就是因为它是表达了人民的心声，通过了类似神怪的形式，给人民说明一种积极思想。如“火焰山”、“闹天宫”之对于封建统治的反抗，“白蛇传”、“天河配”、“柳毅传书”之反对封建思想，“中山狼”之批判无原则的博爱等。在旧社会中，反动阶级不允许人民讲道理和懂道理，因而许多不平之鸣往往借重于神话形式表现出来。
    有的戏不全是神话，而有一点神话成分的，也常被误认为是“迷信”。如“梁山伯与祝英台”中的双蝴蝶，这是神话，不是迷信。因为这只是通过梁、祝的化身，“比翼双飞”，来象征对于封建压迫的抗议，正如“布谷鸟”的民间传说一样，同是表现人民的斗争意志，是光辉的民族艺术成就，不应当作迷信看待。
    神话与民间传说不是同一个东西。整理民间神话或传说不应伤害其中美丽的情节和纯朴的想像，而应充分发挥其中积极的因素，抛弃其消极的因素，使其更健康，更美丽，这决不是“为神话而神话”，或“为艺术而艺术”。这与把神话“现代化”的处理，也有着原则性的区别。
    杨绍萱同志在他的“论为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术的危害性”（载十一月三日本报）一文内却否定了以上的这种看法，他认为可以用神话来影射现实，反映抗美援朝，保卫世界和平等等，并且竭力这样提倡。我以为是不妥当的。杨绍萱同志甚至认为反对借神话反映抗美援朝，就是反对抗美援朝，就是替杜鲁门说话，更是完全没有理由的！这是很简单的常识。譬如我们写抗美援朝的作品，反对把敌人简单地骂成乌龟，反对用谩骂代替战斗，以端正我们的创作态度，正确地运用文艺武器，难道不是为了加强战斗！这难道真是像杨绍萱同志所说的“打击了革命而便宜了敌人”吗？这难道是像杨绍萱同志所说的不拿神话反映抗美援朝就是“资敌”，就是“不允许动一动帝国主义杜鲁门”吗？只不过是对你的作品提出了一点批评的意见，竟至于把自己的同志推到敌人方面去，杨绍萱同志这种无理的态度，是非常错误的！
    杨绍萱同志举毛主席在某次讲话中曾用“愚公移山”的譬喻为例。杨绍萱同志说：“在这个神话故事里，愚公所要移的是太行、王屋二山。毛主席说：‘我们要移掉这两座大山：一为封建主义之山，一为帝国主义之山。’这不是‘借神话影射现实’吗？”毛主席在讲话中用譬喻，这是“借神话影射现实”么？我们认为这是借寓言故事解说现实，正如列宁、斯大林常常借艺术文学的说明之助来加强自己的论据，赋予它们以鲜明性一样，就是所谓“说理著文，非喻不醒”。以“愚公移山”的寓言为例，说明劳动人民改造世界的顽强意志，这与杨绍萱同志借神话反映抗美援朝的“理论”完全是两回事，这之间有什么相同之处呢？我们文艺工作者深入群众，体验生活，常以“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”比喻决心，如果我们编成剧本，就允许以老虎比拟工农兵，以虎穴去比拟工厂、农村和部队了吗！这种不正确的辩护，完全证明了杨绍萱同志思想上的混乱。以历史影射现代已经不可，何况神话！据说有的同志这样说：“以历史影射现代有甚么不可以呢？鲁迅先生的‘故事新编’、郭沫若先生的‘屈原’不都是影射现代的吗？”这种说法，是完全错了的，这是没有想到鲁迅先生写“故事新编”、和郭沫若先生写“屈原”的时代是什么时代！现在又是什么时代！鲁迅先生和郭沫若先生不懂得历史科学么？不，他们对于历史科学比我们懂得太多。他们那时处在黑暗势力统治下面，没有言论自由，很困难公开宣传革命思想，显然的，他们写历史故事和历史剧本，是在当时的历史环境中对敌作战的方式之一，目的不是为了写历史，而是假借历史透露一线阳光，这是完全可以理解的。甚至过去艺人在戏曲演出中的“插科打诨”，对于时政世俗，喜笑怒骂，冷讽热嘲，都有着一定的进步意义；但在今天，在给革命文艺家以充分民主自由，仅仅不给反革命特务分子以民主自由的中华人民共和国，宣传革命思想，又有什么隐晦曲折的必要呢？难道还有人限制你去宣传抗美援朝么！那又有什么理由必须借历史去影射抗美援朝，借“插科打诨”去宣传抗美援朝呢？又有什么理由必须借神话去转弯抹角地反映抗美援朝呢！杨绍萱同志说：“现在有这种说法：‘写抗美援朝就写抗美援朝完了，何必一定要在神话里写呢？’现已证明这是不正确。”我们主张正确地真实地反映抗美援朝，反对以神话去歪曲抗美援朝，难道不是正确的么！事实证明：错误的不是别人，而恰恰是杨绍萱同志自己。
    严肃对待整理神话剧的工作，我们必须反对将神话现代化；必须确定较好的神话剧目，有计划地加以整理和上演，克服与防止迷信神怪戏借神话之名任意上演的现象。另一方面，更重要的是戏曲工作者必须将主要的精力集中到表现现代题材，而不要把编演神话戏作为一种逃避现实的出路。中国丰富的历史事件中，有现实教育意义的题材是很多的，例如农民革命的历史题材就是。特别是现代人民斗争生活的题材，更是丰富无比，应该以此作为主要泉源，创作人民戏曲，坚持人民戏剧创作的正确方向。
