To the Editor:

The Hebei Jixian Cooperative, when signing cotton pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers this year, also placed orders with the county Grain Company for 4,070,000 jin of local wheat and 9,930,000 jin of millet, based on the farmers' order forms. To ensure the fulfillment of these orders, the county cooperative submitted grain request plans to the company twice. However, the Jixian Grain Company failed to honor its commitment. Not only did it not allocate grain to the cooperative, but it also sold large quantities of grain on the market. It is understood that more than 2,000,000 jin of local wheat were sold on the market in September, and more than 1,000,000 jin of local wheat were sold in the first half of October. In addition, more than 3,000,000 jin of millet intended for payment in kind are also being sold in large quantities.

Because the Jixian Grain Company focuses on market sales, it affects supplies to the cooperative. When the payment in kind work began, the company only delivered a little over 900,000 jin of wheat to the payment points to fulfill the contract, which was not enough to meet the needs of cotton farmers. In addition, because the company sells a large amount of grain on the market, the listed price is higher than the market price. For example, the market price of corn in Zaoqiang County on October 17 was 610 yuan (per jin), while the company's listed price was 640 yuan, a difference of 30 yuan per jin. Manager Wang of the company still believed that the difference of 30 yuan between the listed price and the market price was not a problem and did not adjust it in time. This not only violates the agreement between the two parties, but also affects the progress of the cooperative's payment in kind work.

The above situation has greatly affected the cooperative's cotton procurement work. Now, in the southern half of the third and fourth districts of Jixian County, large quantities of cotton have flowed into Nangong City, Fanzhuang and Xinzhang. Cotton farmers in the county cannot obtain grain according to their order forms. Some farmers said, "The government does not act according to the contract"; "The company sells wheat on the market, but we can't get the wheat we ordered." In order to stabilize the cotton farmers' sentiments and ensure the smooth completion of the cotton procurement work, I suggest that relevant departments inspect this issue. The Jixian Grain Company should conduct a thorough self-criticism on this matter and make a public response.

### 冀县粮食公司不履行协议  妨碍合作社收棉付实工作

    冀县粮食公司不履行协议
    妨碍合作社收棉付实工作
    编辑同志：河北冀县合作社在今年与棉农订立预购棉花合同的同时，根据棉农的定货单向该县粮食公司订妥本地小麦四百零七万斤，谷子九百九十三万斤。县合作社为了保证订货单的实现，曾两次向该公司提交需粮计划。但冀县粮食公司不遵守信用，不仅不拨货给合作社，相反地，却将粮食大量抛售到市场上。据了解：九月份就在市场售出本地小麦二百多万斤，十月上半月又售出本地小麦一百多万斤；此外准备付实用的谷子三百多万斤，也正在大批出售中。
    由于冀县粮食公司着重在市场销售，因而影响对合作社的供应。付实工作开始时，该公司运到付实点履行合同的粮食，仅剩下小麦九十多万斤了，不能满足棉农的需求。另外，由于该公司在市场大量出售粮食，以至形成牌价高于市价的现象，如枣强县的玉米市场价格十月十七日是六百一十元（斤），公司的牌价则是六百四十元，每斤相差三十元，而该公司王经理还认为牌价较市价高三十元不算脱节，也未及时进行调整。这不仅违背了双方的协议，并且影响合作社付实工作的进行。
    以上情况使合作社的收棉工作受到很大影响。现在冀县三、四区的南半部，大批棉花已经流入南宫城里、藩庄和新漳一带。该县棉农不能根据定货单取得粮食，有的反映说：“公家不按合同办事”；“公司有麦子在集上卖，我们订的麦子反拿不到”。为了稳定棉农情绪，保证收棉工作顺利完成，我建议有关部门对这一问题进行检查，冀县粮食公司对此事应深刻检讨，并作公开答复。
