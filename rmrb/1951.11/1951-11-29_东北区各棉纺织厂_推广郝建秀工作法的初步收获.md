    The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in the Northeast region has been closely linked with the movement to increase production and practice economy to produce five million tons of grain. After nearly a month and a half of effort (September 7th to October 20th), it has been proven that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method has played a significant role in the increase production and practice economy movement. At the beginning of the promotion work, Hao Jianxiu work method promoters who had participated in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method training class in Qingdao City formed a Hao Jianxiu Work Method promotion team, first conducting key experiments at the Wafangdian Textile Factory, and then promoting it to the Yingkou and Jinzhou textile factories. A Hao Jianxiu Work Method school was also held in the Jinzhou Textile Factory, absorbing 75 outstanding fine yarn workers and technicians from textile factories in Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Dalian, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Wafangdian to participate in the study. After returning to their posts, these trainees universally launched the work of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in their respective factories.

    **Gains from Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method**

    After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in various factories, many new atmospheres have emerged. The first is the reduction of roller waste and the increase in production. The Wafangdian Textile Factory, Yingkou Textile Factory, and Jinzhou No. 1 Textile Factory produced 70 more pieces of yarn in September (mixed counts) due to the reduction of roller waste, equivalent to more than 770 tons of grain. The average roller waste rate of the nine textile factories in the Northeast region was 2.42% in August, which decreased to 1.748% in September; if it can be universally reduced to 0.85% (the record of Yingkou Textile Factory), the annual increase in yarn production can be 2706.6 pieces, equivalent to 29,772.6 tons of grain.

    The quality of products has also been significantly improved in factories that have learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The machines are cleaner than before, and the amount of feathered yarn [1] has decreased. Fly waste has also been reduced, and yarn breakage has also been reduced. Before learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the yarn breakage of the Zhai Juhua group in Jinzhou Textile Factory was 377.5 breaks per thousand spindles per hour; after learning it, the yarn breakage decreased to 315, a reduction of 16%.

    In the process of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, technicians went deep into the workshops, studied operating methods, and discovered obstacles in the machines, as well as incomplete equipment, insufficient tools, or tools that were not easy to use. In order to overcome these problems, the maintenance work was strengthened, and tools were added. In the past, the apron of the machine operator only had two pockets, and roller waste, roving, and plush roller waste were all put together, which was very inconvenient. Now, three pockets have been added, so they can be separated. In the past, the jumping of wooden tubes and the shaking of spindles would increase the yarn breakage rate (the highest yarn breakage was 45 breaks per hundred tubes per hour). Recently, attention has been paid to overcoming these problems during maintenance. After learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the maintenance workers actively solved many problems on the machines and strengthened their connection with the machine operators [2]. The fine yarn maintenance technician of Jinzhou Textile Factory explained the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to the maintenance workers, and the maintenance workers began to pay attention to empty spindles [3]. In the past, more than 100 empty spindles once appeared on 118 machines, but now it has been reduced to 3.5.

    In terms of technical management, the biggest improvement is the abolition of the old passive timed inspection system and the implementation of a new inspection and mutual assistance system. After learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the workers automatically changed the timed inspection to an unscheduled inspection (mainly inspecting the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method). In a mutual aid group, everyone guarantees to check each other, help each other, and learn from each other.

    Another important gain from promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is that administrative cadres and technicians have attached importance to and initially learned to summarize and promote advanced experience, which has further improved the ideological level of employees. The technicians of Jinzhou Textile Factory said: "Now we know that to explore the potential capabilities in production, we must start from improving every small action in the operation. In the past, no one paid attention to these small actions." A workshop director of Jinzhou Textile Factory said: "In the past, we also wanted to promote advanced experience, but there was no way to promote it. Now we know that to promote advanced experience, it must be done as a special work with organization and planning. To solve ideological problems, we must also focus on doing specific promotion work, so that advanced experience can be mastered by the masses."

    After the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was promoted in the fine yarn workshops of various textile factories, other workshops also began to summarize and promote advanced experience. The carding maintenance and wiping group [4] of Jinzhou Textile Factory improved the labor organization, increasing the number of machines wiped from five to seven per day.

    **Two Experiences in Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method**

    The Northeast region has gained the following two experiences in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method:

    (1) In order to smoothly promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, it is necessary to organize the forces of all parties and do a good job in ideological education. Although the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is the central work of the fine yarn workshop, it must have a factory-wide leadership. Responsible cadres and engineers of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League all need to participate in the promotion committee. The promotion work must also obtain the cooperation of the maintenance and roving departments in order to promptly discover and solve problems. Leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League should attach great importance to this work and give it strong support. The administrative side of Jinzhou Textile Factory allocated more than 60 million yuan to add necessary tools and equipment for promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. In addition, attention should be paid to opening up the minds of technicians and old workers, absorbing technicians to participate in various meetings related to promotion work, providing them with various materials related to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and mobilizing them to participate in measurement work so that they can deeply understand the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. In order to break through the conservative thinking of old workers, it is best to hold forums for old workers or invite old workers to perform excellent operating methods. Universal publicity and education are needed for all employees, and in the movement, it is necessary to always pay attention to preventing complacency.

    (2) In the promotion process, theory and practical operation must be closely integrated. Before the promotion, it is necessary to explain the benefits of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to the workers in various ways and organize everyone to discuss it. During the measurement, for each action, it is necessary to explain why it should be done this way and why it should not be done that way, so that the workers can quickly understand and master the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    When promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, some factories in the Northeast region did not provide enough help to workers who produced more roller waste, and even made deviations. The Mudanjiang Textile Factory once mistakenly stipulated that those whose roller waste was lower than the quota would be rewarded, and those who exceeded the quota would be punished. Although these deviations have been corrected, attention should still be paid to them in future promotions.

Note:
    [1] Feathered yarn: Fly waste on normal yarn.
    [2] Machine operator: That is, the worker who watches the machine.
    [3] Empty spindles: Spindles that are not spinning yarn when the machine is running.
    [4] Maintenance and wiping group: Responsible for the periodic cleaning and complete oiling of the machine.

    东北区各棉纺织厂
    推广郝建秀工作法的初步收获
    中国纺织工人社
    东北区关于郝建秀工作法的推广工作，是和增产节约五百万吨粮食运动紧密结合进行的。经过将近一个半月的努力（九月七日到十月二十日），事实证明郝建秀工作法对增产节约运动，已经起了很大作用。推广工作开始时，曾在青岛市参加郝建秀工作法学习班的郝建秀工作者，组成了郝建秀工作法推广小组，先在瓦房店纺织厂进行重点试验，然后推广到营口及金州两纺织厂。并在金州纺织厂举办了郝建秀工作法学校，吸收佳木斯、牡丹江、大连、营口、辽阳、沈阳、锦州、瓦房店等纺织厂的优秀细纱工人和技术人员七十五人参加学习。这些学员回到工作岗位后，即在各厂普遍展开推广郝建秀工作法的工作。
    推广郝建秀工作法的收获
    各厂推广郝建秀工作法后，已出现许多新气象。首先是减少了皮辊花，增加了产量。瓦房店纺织厂、营口纺织厂、金州纺织一厂由于减少了皮辊花，在九月份多出产了七十件纱（各支混合数），折合粮食七百七十余吨。东北九个纺织厂在八月份平均皮辊花率为百分之二点四二，九月份降低到百分之一点七四八；如能普遍降低到百分之零点八五
    （营口纺织厂的记录），全年即可多产纱二七○六点六件，等于二万九千七百七十二点六吨粮食。
    学习了郝建秀工作法的厂子，产品质量也有显著提高。由于机台较前清洁，羽毛纱〔一〕减少了。飞花也减少了，断头也减少了。金州纺织厂翟菊花小组未学习郝建秀工作法前，断头为每千锭一小时三百七十七点五个，学习以后，断头减为三百十五个，减少了百分之十六。
    在推广郝建秀工作法的过程中，技术人员深入车间，研究操作方法，发现了机台方面的障碍，以及设备不全，工具不够或不好使用等毛病；为了克服这些毛病，加强了保全工作，并增添了工具。过去看车工围裙上只有两个口袋，皮辊花、粗纱、绒辊花都装在一起，很不方便；现在增加了三个口袋，就可以分开来装。过去木管跳动，锭子摇头，会增高断头率（每小时每百锭管最高断头四十五个），最近检修时，注意克服了这些毛病。保全工人们学习了郝建秀工作法后，主动地解决了机台上的许多问题，并且加强了与当车工〔二〕的联系。金州纺织厂的细纱保全技术员，向保全工人讲了郝建秀工作法，保全工人开始注意空锭子〔三〕。过去一一八台机曾经出现一百多空锭子，现在减少到三点五个。
    在技术管理方面，最大的改进是废除了旧的被动的定时检查制度，实行了新的检查互助制度。工人们学习了郝建秀工作法后，自动把定时检查改为不定时检查（主要检查推广郝建秀工作法的情况），在一个互助组中，大家保证互相检查，互相帮助，又互相学习。
    推广郝建秀工作法的又一重要收获是：行政干部和技术人员重视并初步学得了总结与推广先进经验，进一步提高了职工的思想水平。锦州纺织厂的技术人员说：“现在我们才知道，要发掘生产中的潜在能力，须要从改进操作中的每一细小动作开始，过去谁也不注意这些小动作。”金州纺织厂一个车间主任说：“过去也想推广先进经验，就是没有办法，推广不出去。现在才知道，推广先进经验，必需有组织、有计划地当作一件专门工作来做。要解决思想问题，也要有重点地做具体的推广工作，这样，先进经验才能为广大群众所掌握。”
    郝建秀工作法在各纺织厂的细纱车间推广后，其他车间也开始总结与推广先进经验了。金州纺织厂梳棉保全揩车组〔四〕改进了劳动组织，由每天揩车五台提高到七台。
    推广郝建秀工作法的两点经验
    东北区在推广郝建秀工作法中，获得了以下两点经验：
    （一）为了顺利推广郝建秀工作法，必须组织各方面的力量，并作好思想教育工作。推广郝建秀工作法虽是细纱车间的中心工作，但一定要有全厂性的领导。党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部及工程师等，都需要参加推广委员会。推广工作还须取得保全、粗纱部门的配合，以便及时发现与解决问题。党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部，应十分重视这一工作，给以有力的支持。金州纺织厂行政方面拨出六千余万元，为推广郝建秀工作法增添必要的工具与设备。此外，要注意打通技术人员和老工人的思想，吸收技术人员参加有关推广工作的各种会议，供给他们各种有关郝建秀工作法的材料，动员他们参加测定工作，让他们深刻地认识郝建秀工作法的意义。为了打通老工人的保守思想，最好召开老工人座谈会，或请老工人表演优秀操作法。对全体职工，需要普遍进行宣传教育，在运动中，并需经常注意防止自满情绪。
    （二）在推广过程中，要使理论与实际操作密切结合起来。在推广前，一定要采取各种方式，向工人讲解郝建秀工作法的好处，并组织大家讨论。在测定时，对每一个动作，都要说明为什么要这样做，为什么不要那样做，使工人们迅速领会，掌握郝建秀工作法的精神。
    东北区有些工厂在推广郝建秀工作法时，对出皮辊花较多的工人帮助不够，甚至发生偏差。牡丹江纺织厂曾经错误地规定皮辊花低于定额者给以奖励，超过定额数字者给以处罚。这些偏向虽然已经纠正，但在今后推广中仍需注意。注：
    〔一〕羽毛纱：正常的纱条上有了飞花。
    〔二〕当车工：即是看车子的工人。
    〔三〕空锭子：机器运转时，没有纺上纱的锭子。
    〔四〕保全揩车组：负责机器周期性的清扫及全部加油工作。
