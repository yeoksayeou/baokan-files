    Economic Life Brief Commentary
    Levying of Native Cloth Goods Tax
    The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government issued an order on the 1st of this month to cease the collection of native cloth transaction tax and to levy a native cloth goods tax. It also stipulated that the tax rate for native cloth goods tax is 4% and 8%. This measure is completely necessary and appropriate for the times.
    The levying of native cloth goods tax can relatively balance the tax burden on machine-made cotton yarn and native yarn. According to tax laws in our country, machine-made cotton yarn is subject to a goods tax of 15% in addition to a unified sales tax of 6%. However, native-made cotton yarn is not subject to goods tax or unified sales tax. Although individual regions levy a small transaction tax on native cloth, this has not solved the problem. This situation has resulted in low costs for native cloth and higher costs for machine-made yarn and cloth, which has affected the supply of raw cotton to machine-made yarn factories and the production and sales plans for machine-made yarn and cloth. Therefore, in order to coordinate with the cotton purchasing and storage movement and ensure the normal production and sales of machine-made yarn and cloth, it is entirely correct and necessary to appropriately tax native cloth.
    Will the levying of native cloth goods tax severely impact the production and sales of native cloth? Investigation materials from several cotton-producing areas answer that this will not be the case. Judging from the production and sales of native cloth in various regions, the profit from operating native cloth is quite high. If strictly calculated based on the tax burden, the native cloth tax rate should be above 20% in order to balance the burden with machine-made yarn. However, in order to take care of the sideline production of the broad masses of farmers and the habit of wearing native cloth, the government has specially stopped the native cloth transaction tax currently collected in various places and changed it to native cloth goods tax, with a tax rate of only 4% and 8%. Therefore, the levying of native cloth goods tax will not have much impact on the production and sales of native cloth.
    In order to meet the clothing needs of the people of the whole country, it is still necessary to give appropriate consideration to the handicraft production of native cloth under the current conditions. However, more attention should be paid to the supply of raw cotton to textile factories. The levying of native cloth goods tax will appropriately solve this problem. Therefore, we believe that this measure of the People's Government will inevitably be unanimously supported by the people of the whole country.

    开征土布货物税
    中央人民政府财政部命令于本月一日停征土布交易税，开征土布货物税。并规定土布货物税的税率，是百分之四与百分之八。这个措施，是完全必要的，是适合时宜的。
    开征土布货物税，可以相对地平衡机制棉纱与土纱的税负。我国机制棉纱，依税法规定，除征收货物税百分之十五外，另有统销税百分之六。而土制棉纱既未征货物税，亦未征统销税。个别地区对土布虽征有少许交易税，但并未能解决这一问题。这种情况，使得土布成本很低，机制纱布成本较高，结果影响了机制纱厂原棉的供应，以及机制纱布的产销计划。因此，为了配合购棉储棉运动，保障机制纱布的正常产销，对土布适当地征一些税，是完全正确的与必要的。
    开征土布货物税后，是否会严重地打击了土布的产销呢？若干产棉区的调查材料回答说：这是不会的。从各地土布的产销情况看来，经营土布的利润是相当高的。如从税负上严格核算，则土布税率应为百分之二十以上，方能与机制纱负担趋于平衡。但为了照顾广大农民的副业生产与穿用土布的习惯，政府特把各地现在征收的土布交易税停止，改为土布货物税，而税率仅定为百分之四与百分之八。因此，开征土布货物税后，对土布的产销，是不会有多大影响的。
    为了满足全国人民的穿衣需要，在目前条件下，对于手工业的土布生产加以适当照顾，还是必要的。但对纺织工厂的原棉供应，更需予以照顾。开征土布货物税，将可适当地解决这一问题。所以，我们认为，人民政府这种措施，必然获得全国人民一致的拥护。
