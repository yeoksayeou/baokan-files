How the Chahar Nursery Was Run Well

Editor: Nursery workers are the most important staff in nursery institutions, and whether children are well cared for depends largely on the nursery workers. Generally, there are two main issues among nursery workers: one is how to strengthen the education of nursery workers, and the other is the issue of nursery workers' own children. However, in retrospect, our institution did not handle these two issues very well in the past. Firstly, in terms of their learning, we did not pay enough attention. We only asked them to take care of the work, and often neglected their learning. As a result, some nursery workers developed an incorrect understanding of childcare work. They considered childcare work to be "cleaning up messes," were not proactive in their work, had weak sense of responsibility, and their work efficiency was very low. Some children's mothers were also dissatisfied with the institution. As for the issue of their children, no appropriate solution was provided at the beginning. Later, all the staff in our institution held a meeting to discuss a method to solve the learning problems of nursery workers and the issues with their children. We organized the nursery workers and clearly divided the work: one team was responsible for teaching, and the other team was responsible for managing the children's lives, so they had time to study. As for the children of the nursery workers, our solution was this: we established a nursery room in our institution, and all infants of the institution's staff could join. For staff members' infants entering the nursery room, those on a salary system paid one-quarter of their full monthly salary, and those on a supply system paid all the nanny fees as funding. When it was insufficient, a portion was drawn from the savings of office expenses and miscellaneous expenses to subsidize it. The institution also subsidized the children's small amount of clothing and medical expenses. After this was implemented, everyone was very satisfied. Some nursery workers said, "The nursery has become our home and school." They are also more concerned and responsible for their work.

　　察哈尔保育院是怎样办好的
    编辑同志：保育员是保育机关中最重要的工作人员，孩子带得好不好，保育员起着决定的作用。而在保育员中间，一般存在着这样两个问题：一个是如何加强保育员的教育问题；另一个是保育员自己的孩子问题。但是，检讨起来，我院过去对于这两个问题，都是处理得不大好的。首先以她们的学习来说，我们是不够重视的，我们只是叫她们照顾工作，而对于她们的学习往往不注意。结果，就使某些保育员对保育工作产生了一种不正确的认识。她们认为保育工作“是擦屁股工作”，平时工作不积极，责任心薄弱，工作效能很低。有些孩子的母亲也就对院方不满意了。至于她们的孩子问题，开始时也没有予以适当的解决。后来我院全体人员开会商定一个办法，来解决保育员的学习和她们的孩子问题。我们把保育员组织起来，并明确地分了工：一个班担任教学工作，一个班负责管理孩子的生活，这样她们就有时间学习了。至于保育员的孩子问题，我们的处理办法是这样的：在本院成立一个乳儿室，凡是本院工作人员的乳儿都可以加入。工作人员的乳儿入乳儿室，薪金制的交全月薪金的四分之一，供给制的交全部保姆费作为经费，不够时从办公费和杂费的节余部分内抽出一部分补助，孩子的少量衣服和医药费也由院方补助。这样执行以后，大家都很满意，有的保育员说：“保育院成为咱们的家和学校了。”她们对工作也就比较关心负责了。
