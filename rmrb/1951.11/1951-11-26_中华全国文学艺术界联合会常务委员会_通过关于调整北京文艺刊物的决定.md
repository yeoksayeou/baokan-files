Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles passed a resolution on the 20th regarding the adjustment of Beijing literary and art periodicals. The full text is as follows:

There are as many as ten types of regular and irregular literary and art periodicals (excluding pictorials) published in Beijing, the vast majority of which are national publications. The state and the people demand that these publications truly become the core of national literary and artistic creation and criticism, both as links and guides for the broad masses of readers and as organizers and supervisors of writers from all fields. Each publication must have a clear fighting goal, strong ideological content, life content, and mass-based style, and become a constant innovator in the literary and art cause. However, the existing publications are far from meeting this requirement. In order to concentrate existing editorial and writing forces to make literary and art publications meet the above requirements, it is decided to adjust existing literary and art publications according to the principle of "less but better" as follows:

	(1) Strengthen "Wenyi Bao" [Literary Gazette] to make it a comprehensive art review and art study publication on literature, drama, fine arts, music, and film. Critical articles originally published in "Renmin Xiju" [People's Drama], "Renmin Yinyue" [People's Music], "Xin Xiqu" [New Opera], and other publications should be transferred to "Wenyi Bao" for publication. To this end, the editorial board of "Wenyi Bao" should be reorganized, and editors in film, drama, fine arts, and music should be added to ensure the completion of this task.

	(2) Strengthen "Renmin Wenxue" [People's Literature] to make it a publication that concentrates on publishing excellent works from across the country. In addition to ensuring the necessary artistic level of the works, special attention should be paid to the works' ideology, militancy, and mass character. The connection with local publications should be strengthened, and excellent works from local publications should be carefully selected and published. Creative writing should be guided, and current commentary on creative writing should be provided, with criticism and introduction of works published in this and other literary and art publications. In addition, a certain amount of space should be used to publish more systematic theoretical critical articles, as well as research on classical Chinese literature and introductions to world progressive literature. The editorial board of "Renmin Wenxue" should be reorganized and enriched.

	(3) Strengthen "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" [Telling Stories and Singing Songs]. The original "Beijing Wenyi" [Beijing Literature and Art] will cease publication, and its editorial staff will merge with the "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" editorial department to form a new editorial board. "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" should become a publication for publishing excellent popular literature and guiding popular art work across the country.

	(4) "Renmin Xiju" [People's Drama], "Xin Xiqu" [New Opera], "Renmin Yinyue" [People's Music], and "Minjian Wenyi Jikan" [Collection of Folk Literature and Art] will cease publication. A special journal of scripts, tentatively named "Juben" [Scripts], will be published in a small format to regularly supply various scripts to the country. In the field of music, a similar small publication, tentatively named "Gequ" [Songs], will be published to focus on songs, with accompanying introductions and explanations of the songs. "Renmin Meishu" [People's Fine Arts] will not resume publication. Artworks will be submitted to "Renmin Wenxue" [People's Literature], "Wenyi Bao" [Literary Gazette], and "Renmin Huabao" [People's Pictorial] for publication.

	(5) "Xin Dianying" [New Film] will cease publication. "Dazhong Dianying" [Popular Film] will be strengthened to make it a national film publication that guides audiences.

    中华全国文学艺术界联合会常务委员会
    通过关于调整北京文艺刊物的决定
    【新华社二十五日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会常务委员会扩大会议二十日通过关于调整北京文艺刊物的决定，全文如下：
    北京出版的定期和不定期的文艺刊物（画报在外）有十种之多，其中绝大多数都是具有全国性的刊物。国家和人民要求这些刊物真正成为全国文学艺术的创作和批评的核心，既是广大的读者群众的联系者和指导者，又是各方面作家的组织者和监督者。各个刊物都必须有明确的战斗目标，强烈的思想内容、生活内容和群众化的风格，成为文艺事业的不断的革新者。而现有的刊物离开这个要求是很远的。为着集中现有的编辑著作力量使文艺刊物符合于上述要求，决定对现有文艺刊物按照“少而精”的原则作如下的调整：
    （一）加强“文艺报”，使成为关于文学、戏剧、美术、音乐、电影的综合性的艺术评论刊物和艺术学习刊物。原在“人民戏剧”、“人民音乐”、“新戏曲”等刊物上登载的评论性文字，都转移到“文艺报”登载。为此，应当改组“文艺报”的编辑委员会，增加电影、戏剧、美术、音乐等方面的编辑人员，以保证完成此项任务。
    （二）加强“人民文学”，使“人民文学”成为集中发表全国优秀作品的刊物。除保证作品的应有的艺术水平外，应当特别注意作品的思想性、战斗性和群众性。应当加强与地方刊物的联系，认真地选载地方刊物上的优秀作品。应当指导创作，设创作时评，对本刊和其他文艺刊物发表的作品加以批评和介绍。此外，应当以一定篇幅发表较有系统的理论批评论文，和对于中国古典文学的研究与世界进步文学的介绍。“人民文学”编辑委员会应当加以改组和充实。
    （三）加强“说说唱唱”。原有的“北京文艺”停止出版，其编辑人员与“说说唱唱”编辑部合并，另组新的编辑委员会。“说说唱唱”应当成为发表优秀通俗文学作品和指导全国通俗文艺工作的刊物。
    （四）“人民戏剧”、“新戏曲”、“人民音乐”、“民间文艺集刊”停止出版。另出一专刊剧本的定名为“剧本”的小型的刊物，定期地向全国供应各种剧本。音乐方面出一同样小型刊物，定名为“歌曲”，专登歌曲，附以介绍和说明歌曲的文字。“人民美术”不恢复出版，美术作品分别交“人民文学”、“文艺报”和“人民画报”登载。
    （五）“新电影”停刊。加强“大众电影”，使成为指导观众的全国性的电影刊物。
