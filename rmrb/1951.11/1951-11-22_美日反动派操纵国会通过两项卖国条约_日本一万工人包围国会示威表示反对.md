Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: After the American and Japanese reactionaries manipulated the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives to approve the separate "peace treaty" with Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," they manipulated the Japanese Diet's House of Councillors on the 18th to approve these two treaties that enslave the Japanese people and prepare to launch a war of aggression.

Before the House of Councillors approved the separate "peace treaty" and the "Security Treaty," many opposition party councilors raised questions, criticizing these two treaties that betrayed the national interests of Japan and ruined the country. All councilors from the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the left wing of the Socialist Party voted against these two treaties. Even the Socialist Party's right-wing councilors, who openly supported the separate "peace treaty," voted against the "Security Treaty." The voting situation in the House of Councillors was: regarding the separate peace treaty, 45 votes against, 174 votes in favor; regarding the "Security Treaty," 76 votes against, 147 votes in favor.

After the Yoshida government approved the separate "peace treaty" and the "Security Treaty" in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, it immediately asked Emperor Hirohito to sign the ratification documents for the two treaties on the 19th. On the 20th, the Yoshida cabinet meeting announced that the ratification procedures for the two treaties had been completed. The traitorous Yoshida government is also preparing to submit the ratification documents, which are tantamount to a Japanese bill of sale, to its American masters in the near future.

After the American and Japanese reactionaries manipulated the Japanese Diet to approve the two treaties, even some conservative parties in Japan expressed concern and dissatisfaction. Wada Hiroo of the Socialist Party's left wing said that the separate "peace treaty" and the "Security Treaty" "deepened the war crisis in Asia and the crisis of Japan being involved in disputes." He worried that Japan would "inevitably fall into a tragic fate." He also pointed out that these two treaties contain the burden of huge rearmament expenses, which will seriously threaten the lives of the Japanese people in the future.

As with the opposition to the House of Representatives' approval, the Japanese people universally opposed the House of Councillors' approval of the two treaties that ruin the country. On the afternoon of the 17th, when the House of Councillors' Treaty Committee discussed the approval of the two treaties, about 10,000 members of the labor union organizations of Japanese government officials and the unions affiliated to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan under the influence of the Socialist Party surrounded the Diet Building and held demonstrations against the House of Councillors' approval of the separate "peace treaty" and the "Security Treaty."

    美日反动派操纵国会通过两项卖国条约
    日本一万工人包围国会示威表示反对
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：美、日反动派在操纵日本国会众院批准单独对日“和约”和美日“安全条约”之后，又在十八日操纵日本国会参院批准了这两项奴役日本人民、准备发动侵略战争的条约。
    在参院批准单独“和约”和“安全条约”以前，许多在野党的参议员曾提出质问，抨击这两项出卖日本民族利益的亡国条约。日本共产党、劳农党以及社会党左派的全体参议员一致投票反对这两项条约。甚至公开支持单独“和约”的社会党右派的参议员，对“安全条约”也投了反对票。参院的投票情形是：关于单独和约，四十五票反对，一百七十四票赞成；关于“安全条约”，七十六票反对，一百四十七票赞成。
    吉田政府在众、参两院批准单独“和约”和“安全条约”之后，立即在十九日请日皇裕仁在两项条约的批准书上签了字。二十日，吉田内阁会议宣布对两项条约的批准手续完成。吉田卖国政府并准备在短期内将形同日本卖身契的批准书呈缴其美国主子。
    美、日反动派操纵日本国会批准两项条约后，甚至日本的一些保守党派也表示忧虑和不满。社会党左派的和田博雄说：单独“和约”和“安全条约”“加深了亚洲的战争危机和日本卷入纷争的危机”。他担心日本“必然陷入悲惨的命运”。他并指出：这两项条约包藏着巨额的重新武装费用的负担，这将使日本人民今后的生活受到严重的威胁。
    和反对众院批准一样，日本人民普遍地反对参院批准两项亡国条约。十七日下午，当参院条约委员会讨论批准两项条约时，日本政府机关工作人员的工会组织以及社会党影响下的日本工会总评议会所属各工会的会员约一万人，包围国会大厦，举行示威，反对参院批准单独“和约”和“安全条约”。
