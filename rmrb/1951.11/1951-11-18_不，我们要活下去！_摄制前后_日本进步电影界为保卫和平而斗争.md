The Japanese film industry, like other cultural and economic endeavors of the Japanese people, has suffered severe devastation at the hands of the American occupiers in recent years. Last year, American films accounted for forty percent of the total revenue from Japanese film distribution. This year, almost all of the first-run cinemas across Japan are exclusively occupied by American films. The American occupiers have even sent troops to besiege Japanese film companies, suppressing and expelling progressive film workers, and disbanding labor unions. The most outstanding members of the Japanese film industry have been dismissed by them. The remaining Japanese film industry is only allowed to produce films that, like American films, promote war and decadent, licentious lifestyles.

However, the Japanese people and progressive filmmakers have launched a powerful counterattack against the barbaric actions of American imperialism in instigating war and destroying Japanese culture. The broad masses of Japanese audiences have organized to watch healthy films appearing in certain cinemas, and have further developed into a movement to raise small funds from the masses to produce and distribute progressive films. The Japanese film "No, We Want to Live!", completed in June of this year, was made in this way. The protagonist of this film is a Japanese unemployed worker living the most miserable life in Tokyo – there are as many as eighteen million unemployed and semi-unemployed workers in Japan! – representing the Japanese people's anger and resistance to imperialist rule.

This film was co-produced by the Japanese progressive theater troupe "Zenshinza" and film workers. They had no funds, no cameras or recorders, and no studio. They raised funds from the masses across the country through small contributions and donations. Equipment and stages were borrowed. The actors of "Zenshinza" even used their performance breaks to collect donations from the audience in their costumes. The Japanese people enthusiastically supported this just struggle. Broad masses of workers and farmers contributed five or ten yuan to raise funds for them. Japanese workers in Iidabashi, Tokyo, donated the income from their amateur labor to film the movie. Female students donated their saved study expenses. An old lady from a senior citizens' association saved money from her child's bath fee every day to donate. All the staff and actors who filmed this movie only took food expenses during production, and their salaries were paid from the income after the film was released. They worked on writing and producing the film through countless difficulties. They searched for subjects from the daily life of the lowest level of Japanese unemployed workers. They constantly fought with the censorship authorities, and also suffered various obstacles from the reactionary authorities. For example, on May 12, the collective residence of "Zenshinza" members was searched by more than a thousand policemen. However, with the support of the broad masses of Japanese people, this film was finally successfully produced after three months of struggle.

After the film was made, all film management companies and cinemas across Japan were afraid of being implicated and dared not show it. However, due to the demands of the Japan National Film Mass Solidarity Council and the broad masses of audiences and mass organizations, it was finally fought for to be screened in 200 cinemas across Japan this summer, which aroused a very enthusiastic response and praise. Although the Japanese bourgeois newspapers tried to obliterate its achievements, they had to admit that it was the first-class work of the year.

The Japanese people used their own hands to show films they made themselves. At each screening, they held a peace rally and launched a signature campaign to support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

The just struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese progressive film workers for peace and democracy and against using films as tools of war is continuing. They are preparing to complete their second work this year, and have launched a movement to establish a Japanese people's film studio and call for the production of "films to defend peace."

The Japan National Film Mass Solidarity Council, the Toho Labor Union (note: Toho is one of Japan's largest film companies), and the Japanese progressive theater troupe "Zenshinza" have written to the All-China Film Art Workers Association, all Chinese film workers, Chinese film audiences, and the Chinese people, respectively, reporting on their struggles and calling for assistance from progressive people around the world. They heroically declared: "No matter how strong the enemy's offensive is, inspired by the Chinese and Korean people's struggle to liberate Asia, we will definitely shoulder a share of the responsibility for driving the imperialists out of Japan, and further unite the masses to strive for peace, and win victory in the struggle to produce progressive films!" Yes, the just struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese progressive film workers will surely win victory. Our people and people's film workers express their just support for this struggle.

### “不，我们要活下去！”摄制前后  ——日本进步电影界为保卫和平而斗争

    “不，我们要活下去！”摄制前后
     ——日本进步电影界为保卫和平而斗争
    日本的电影事业，也和其他日本人民的文化、经济事业一样，几年来遭受了美国占领者严重的摧残。去年日本影片发行总收入的百分之四十给美国电影占了去。今年日本全国所有的头轮电影院，几乎全部被美国电影独占了。美国占领者更派军队围攻日本的电影企业，镇压和驱逐进步的电影工作者，解散工会组织。日本电影界的最优秀的分子都被他们解职了。剩下来的日本电影事业，也只允许拍摄一些和美国电影一样的宣传战争、宣传荒淫堕落生活的影片。
    但是，日本人民和进步的电影工作者，对美帝国主义挑拨战争与摧残日本文化的野蛮行为进行了强大的反击。日本广大观众有组织地去看出现在某些影院中的健康的电影，进而发展成为从群众中募集零碎资金来摄制和发行进步影片的运动。今年六月间制成的日本影片“不，我们要活下去！”就是这样完成的。这部影片描写的主人公，是在东京过着最悲惨的生活的日本失业工人——失业和半失业工人在日本有一千八百万之多啊！——它代表着日本人民对于帝国主义统治的愤怒和反抗。
    这部电影是日本的进步剧团“前进座”和电影工作者合拍的。他们没有资金、没有摄影机和录音机，也没有制片厂。他们在全国人民大众中间，以零星的出资和捐募来凑集资金。器材和舞台都是借用的。“前进座”的演员们，更利用他们公演的休息时间穿着戏装向观众募款。日本人民热烈支持了这一正义的斗争。广大工人、农民五元、十元地为他们凑集资金。东京饭田桥的日本工人，用业余劳动的收入为拍摄这部影片捐款。女学生们捐出她们节省下来的学习费用。一个敬老会的老太太，每天从孩子的洗澡费里节省下钱来捐出。拍摄这部影片的全体工作人员和演员，制片时只取膳食费，薪金都是在影片上演以后由收入中支付的。他们经过无数的困难来从事编剧和摄制工作。他们从日本失业者最下层的日佣工人生活中去找题材。他们不断地和检查当局进行斗争，还遭受了反动当局的种种阻扰，例如在五月十二日，“前进座”同人的集体住所就曾被一千多名警察搜查。但是，在广大日本人民的支持下，这部电影经过三个月的奋斗过程，终于摄制成功了。
    这部影片制成后，日本全国所有影片经理公司和电影院都曾因怕受牵连而不敢放映。但是，由于日本全国电影群众团结协议会和广大观众与群众团体的要求，终于争取在今年夏天在日本全国二百家电影院开始放映，引起了非常热烈的反应和称赞。日本资产阶级的报纸，虽然想抹杀它的成就，但也不得不承认它是本年度的第一级作品。
    日本人民用自己的手放映了自己摄制的影片，在每次放映时，都召开了保卫和平大会，发动了拥护缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动。
    日本人民和日本进步电影工作者为争取和平、民主，反对把电影当作战争工具的正义斗争正在继续进行。他们准备在今年内完成第二部作品，并发动了建立日本人民的电影制片厂和呼吁摄制“保卫和平的影片”的运动。
    日本全国电影群众团结协议会，日本东宝劳动组合（按：东宝是日本最大的电影企业之一）和日本进步剧团“前进座”，曾分别写信给中华全国电影艺术工作者协会以及中国全体电影工作者、中国的电影观众和中国人民，报告他们的斗争经过，呼吁全世界进步人民的援助。他们英勇地宣告：“无论敌人的攻势如何强大，我们在中国人民和朝鲜人民的解放亚洲的斗争鼓舞之下，一定会担负起驱逐帝国主义者退出日本的斗争的一份责任，更进一步结合人民群众争取和平的斗争力量，在争取摄制进步影片的斗争中获得胜利！”是的，日本人民和日本进步电影工作者的正义斗争必然会获得胜利的，我国人民和人民电影工作者对这个斗争表示正义的声援。（附图片）
