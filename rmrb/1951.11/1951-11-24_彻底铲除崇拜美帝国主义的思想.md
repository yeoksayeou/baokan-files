　　Thoroughly Eradicate the Thought of Worshipping American Imperialism
　　Zhou Jinhuang, Director of the Pharmacology Department, Chinese Union Medical College

　　In the past six months of work and study, I have begun to realize that the ideology of starting from personal interests is the root of all my wrong thoughts. The gestation and development of this kind of thinking are inseparable from my family background, especially the education I have received from American imperialism for many years. The great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has prevented my deep-rooted thought of worshipping American imperialism from continuing to develop, but I dare not say that it has been completely eliminated. Therefore, I am willing to raise my problems and ask for everyone's criticism and guidance.

　　First, let me recall a past event. After the liberation of Wuhan in 1949, I decided to leave Wuhan University Medical College and wholeheartedly wanted to come to Peking Union Medical College. At that time, the Central South Ministry of Health needed me to undertake medical education work. I was unwilling to stay in Wuhan at the time, and I didn't dare to frankly admit my selfish plans in my heart. After procrastinating for a few months, I felt very uneasy, and finally succumbed to personal interests and rejected the government's appointment. At that time, I insisted on my personal opinions and emphasized the empty talk of striving for academics; I verbally said that coming to Xiehe was also to serve the people, and there was no need to stay in Wuhan, but in reality, it was entirely for personal considerations.

　　Why did I generate this kind of individualism and not feel that it was wrong? Why did I insist on going to Xiehe, which was run by American imperialism at that time, when the motherland needed me?

　　At the beginning of liberation, I had absolutely no thoughts of hating American imperialism, otherwise I would not have returned to Xiehe. I was a "specialist" trained by the old Peking Union Medical College, and I thought I still had a set of scientific academic ideas. Behind this idea, another idea – the idea of personal liberalism combined with the thought of worshipping American imperialism – was driving my work. I believed that: studying medicine could allow me not to rely on others for food, only others would ask me and I would not ask others; having technology would make me a special person with social status. Xiehe was said to be the "best" medical school in China in the old society. In order to enter Xiehe, one must first study at a church university for three years. In order to further consolidate my academic position, I also had to go to the United States. My future seemed to be arranged so properly, and I moved forward in this direction.

　　In the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, Xiehe did anesthetize many young intellectuals. Whether from the "free development" of personal life or work interests, Xiehe had its own special allure. Didn't my desire to leave Wuhan University and return to Xiehe the year before last a concrete manifestation of the combination of the thought of worshipping American imperialism and personal interests? Today, there are still some "Xiehe people" who still remain in the United States and do not plan to return to serve the motherland. Is this an individual manifestation, or is it the result of Xiehe's education? Why has there never been a "Xiehe person" who has stayed in the old revolutionary base areas for a long time to serve the people? Are these facts accidental?

　　I am an old intellectual trained by the old Xiehe. What impact did the old Xiehe's educational ideology have on me? Do these ideological problems still exist in today's new Xiehe?

　　In order to cultivate people to serve American bourgeois culture and make them tools for American imperialist cultural aggression, Xiehe in the past encouraged all thoughts and styles starting from personal interests and personal interests. This kind of thinking is expressed in emphasizing personal interests, blindly engaging in research, and free business. Doctors serve the rich; hospitals are places to train medical students; clinical research is based on the personal interests of the attending physician, and treatment is an ancillary task; hospitals become a means of absorbing "interested patients." Research is not to solve common problems that most people care about; teaching has also become an opportunity for professors to express their personal research "experiences" and quote scriptures and classics. A course is taught by several "experts" separately, each with their own set, which is certainly very exciting, but it makes the students suffer.

　　Regarding the ideological problem of "international standards": From the traditional "honor" in the past, Xiehe has standards for maintaining "international academic standards." The so-called international standards are not entirely American standards, but all teaching, research, and medical care are based on bourgeois standards. For example, the evaluation of research is based on whether the research paper has been "honored" to be published in a foreign magazine. The standards for drug quality are not based on the standards of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, but on British and American commodities. I remember that when we discussed compiling and printing a new edition of the Xiehe Hospital prescription book last year, an American professor believed that the proprietary drug names of major American pharmaceutical factories should also be included in our prescription book. Although this book was not printed in a new edition, the old edition and the comprador ideology it represents are still prevalent among us. Such thinking cannot but be liquidated.

　　Speaking of the relationship between scientific research and politics, in the past we believed that scientific research should not be affected by political ideology. Then, what determines our attitude towards a research topic? Why are we intensely interested in one topic and not very interested in another? Why is it easy to accept the therapeutic effect of "adrenocorticotropic hormone" (a type of endocrine) that was popular in British and American medicine for a while, but not very interested in the research of the Soviet "biogenic stimulants"? The former is a tissue component that is not easy to refine, while the latter is a tissue component that is easy to prepare. Although our school has conducted some research on tissue therapy, in terms of the personnel mobilized, we are far less than the China Medical University in Shenyang; in terms of the number of people treated, we are far less than a rural doctor in Pingyuan Province. Why is tissue therapy widely promoted in China Medical University and rural areas in Pingyuan Province, but not valued in Xiehe? We who are engaged in research work, even if we want to start from purely technical and personal interests, cannot but be dominated by class ideology. If the thought of worshipping American imperialism is not eliminated, the ideology of the European and American reactionary bourgeoisie will make us choose what we have been accustomed to in the past. If we do not recognize this, our medical research will be divorced from the masses and divorced from reality.

　　Regarding the ideological problem of democratic style and centralized leadership: In the old Xiehe, it was not easy to find even old democracy, and what could be seen was only "oligarchy." The administrative leadership did not consult with the masses or adopt the opinions of the masses. The employment relationship of "stay if you agree, leave if you disagree" was obvious in Xiehe. Has the situation in Xiehe today completely changed? I say no, democratic style has not yet been established in Xiehe. In addition to "original salary and original position," we also retain the "original system and original style." From another perspective, Xiehe is too "democratic." We still retain the system of a provost rotating every year. This is a manifestation of American "democratic" thinking. We frankly admit that under this system, the provost's office can only do some administrative work, cannot grasp the teaching principles and plans, and cannot play the role of ideological leadership. Each department manages its own affairs. Teachers in each department lack connection in teaching content and are not practical. All teaching plans are pushed to each department for free decision. Therefore, school administrators have not led the work of students going to the countryside during the summer vacation, thinking that field education during the summer vacation and learning and work in the vast rural areas are not related to Xiehe's teaching plan. This policy of not paying attention to practical education cannot make our educational plan meet the needs of current national construction. Therefore, to thoroughly reform Xiehe's educational system, we must first strengthen the connection between departments and establish a centralized leadership system in the provost's office, so that business can advance steadily under the leadership of political thought.

　　In summary, under the long-term education of Xiehe, I have been ideologically poisoned by American imperialist cultural aggression. This ideological poisoning has made me unable to adhere to the people's stand, unable to love the motherland and the people; I lack a fighting spirit and dare not criticize myself and expose shortcomings in my work. Today I must thoroughly criticize everything in the past Xiehe. Old ideas can no longer be used to lead the work of today's Chinese Union Medical College. The students of Xiehe also warmly look forward to the success of the self-education of our Xiehe teachers, creating conditions for the thorough transformation of our school.

　　彻底铲除崇拜美帝国主义的思想
    中国协和医学院药理科主任  周金黄
    在最近半年的工作和学习中，我开始认识到从个人利益出发的思想是我的一切错误思想的根源。这种思想的孕育和发展是与我的家庭出身，特别是自己多年来所受的美帝国主义的教育分不开的。伟大的抗美援朝运动已使我这根深蒂固的崇拜美帝国主义的思想不再继续发展，但我还不敢说这已经完全消灭了。因此，我愿意将我的问题提出来，请大家批评和指教。
    首先让我追述一段往事。一九四九年武汉解放后，我就决定离开武汉大学医学院，一心一意要到北京协和医学院来。这时中南卫生部正需要我担任医学教育工作。我当时不肯留在武汉，又不敢坦白地承认内心的自私打算，拖延了几个月，情绪非常不安，终于屈服于个人利益，拒绝了政府的聘约。当时我坚持个人意见，强调为学术而努力的空话；口头上说是到协和来也是为人民服务，大可不必留在武汉，实际上完全是为个人打算。
    我为什么会产生这种个人主义的思想而还不觉得它是错误的呢？为什么当祖国需要我的时候我坚持要到当时美帝国主义办的协和来呢？
    在解放之初，我绝没有仇视美帝国主义的思想，否则我就不会回到协和来。我是旧协和医学院培养出来的一位“专家”，自以为还有一套科学的学术思想。在这一思想的后面另一种思想——和崇拜美帝国主义的思想相结合的个人自由主义思想——推动着我的工作。我认为：学了医可以不靠人吃饭，只有人求我而我不求人；有了技术就会成为有社会地位的特殊人物。协和在旧社会说来是中国“最好”的医学校。为了要进协和就必先念三年教会大学。为了更巩固自己在学术上的地位，还得往美国去一趟。我的前途似乎就是这样妥贴地安排了，我也就本此方向迈进。
    在半殖民地的旧中国，协和确曾麻醉了不少青年知识分子。无论从个人生活或工作兴趣的“自由发展”来讲，协和是具有它的特殊的诱惑力的。前年我要脱离武汉大学而回到协和来，岂不是崇拜美帝国主义的思想和个人利益相结合的具体表现吗？今天还有一些“协和人”仍然留在美国，并不打算回来为祖国服务。这是个别的表现呢，还是协和教育的结果呢？为什么就从来也没有一个“协和人”长期地留在老根据地为人民服务呢？这些事实是偶然的吗？
    我是旧协和培养出来的旧知识分子。旧协和的教育思想对我起了哪些影响呢？这些思想问题在今天的新协和是否还存在呢？
    为了培养为美国资产阶级文化服务的人物，使他们成为美帝国主义文化侵略的工具，协和在过去就鼓励一切从个人兴趣和个人利益出发的思想和作风。这种思想表现在强调个人兴趣、盲目研究、自由营业。医生是为有钱的人服务的；医院是培养医学生的场所；临床研究是以主治医师的个人兴趣为主体，治疗是附带的工作；医院变成了吸收“有兴趣的病人”的一种手段。研究不是为了要解决多数人关怀的普遍的问题；教书也就成为教授们发挥个人研究“心得”和引经据典的机会了。一门功课由几位“专家”分别讲授，各人一套，固然是十分精彩，可苦了学生们。
    关于“国际水平”的思想问题：从过去的传统“荣誉”上说，协和有维持“国际学术水平”的标准。所谓国际水平，虽不完全是美国标准，但一切教学、研究、医疗无不以资产阶级的水平为准绳。例如对研究的估价就以这篇研究论文是否“荣幸地”在国外杂志上发表过为依据。药物品质的标准不是按中国药典的标准，而是以英美商品为根据。记得在去年讨论编印新版协和医院处方书的时候，就有一位美籍教授认为应当将美国大药厂的专用药品名也放在我们的处方书里。虽然这本书没有印出新版来，但是旧版和它所代表的买办思想还是在我们中间流行着。对这样的思想是不能不予以清算的。
    谈到科学研究与政治的关系，过去我们认为科学研究是不应当受到政治思想的影响的。那末，什么东西决定着我们对于一个研究题目的态度呢？为什么我们对于某一个题目有浓厚的兴趣，而对另一个题目又引不起很大的兴趣来？为什么对英美医学喧嚷一时的“副肾皮层促激素”（为内分泌的一种）的治疗作用很容易接受，而对苏联的“生物原刺激素”的研究就不太有兴趣呢？前者是不容易提炼的组织成分，后者是很容易制备的组织成分。我们学校虽然曾经进行了一些组织疗法的研究，但是就动员的人员来说，我们远不及沈阳中国医科大学；就治疗的人数来说，我们又远不及平原省的一位乡村医生。为什么组织疗法在中国医科大学和平原省农村里会大量推行，而在协和就不被重视呢？我们担任研究工作的人，即使要从纯技术和个人兴趣出发的话，也不能不受到阶级思想的支配。崇拜美帝国主义的思想不清除，欧美反动资产阶级的思想就会使我们去选择我们过去所习惯的东西。如果我们不认识这一点，我们的医药研究将会脱离群众，脱离实际。
    关于民主作风和集中领导的思想问题：在旧协和是连旧民主都不容易找到的，所能见到的只是“寡头制度”。行政领导方面既不和群众商量，又不采纳群众的意见。“合则留，不合则去”的雇佣关系在协和是明显的。今天协和的情况是否已完全改变了呢？我说没有，民主作风在协和还没有建立起来。除了“原薪原职”，我们还保留了“原制度，原作风”。从另一个角度来看，协和又太“民主”了。我们至今还保留着一年一轮的教务长制度。这便是美国“民主”思想的表现。我们坦白地承认，在这种制度下的教务处只能做一些事务性的工作，掌握不了教学原则和计划，更无从发挥思想领导的作用。各系各自为政。各科教员在教学内容上缺乏联系，而且不切合实际需要。一切教学计划推到各系去自由决定。因此学校行政领导者对于学生暑期下乡的工作就没有领导起来，以为暑期的实地教育和在广大农村中的学习与工作是和协和的教学计划无关的。这样不重视实际教育的政策就不能使我们的教育计划配合目前国家建设的需要。因此，要彻底改革协和的教育制度，首先就得加强各科之间的连系，建立教务处的集中领导制度，使业务在政治思想的领导下稳步前进。
    总起来说，在协和的长期教育下，我在思想上受到了美帝国主义文化侵略的毒害，这种思想毒害使我不能坚持人民的立场，不能热爱祖国和人民；缺乏斗争精神，不敢批评自己和揭发工作中的缺点。今天我必须对过去协和的一切加以彻底的批判。旧思想是不能再用来领导今天的中国协和医学院的工作了。协和的同学们也热忱地企待着我们协和教师们的自我教育的成功，为我们学校的彻底改造创造条件。
