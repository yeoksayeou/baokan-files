　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Striving to Strengthen the Friendly Unity of All Nationalities
　　Bao Erhan
    The policies of the Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and later the Kuomintang reactionary regime towards minority nationalities were to oppress them, implement assimilation policies, create ethnic hatred, and hinder the cultural and economic progress and development of the various minority nationalities. Now, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved nationwide victory, the People's Republic of China has been established, and a people's democratic dictatorship has been erected. Only now have the various minority nationalities in the country been liberated and become members with equal rights in the big family of the People's Republic of China. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government has implemented a correct proletarian nationality policy, opening up a broad road for the rapid political, economic, and cultural development of all nationalities. Nationalities that never had written languages or alphabets now have the opportunity to create their own writing systems, compile textbooks in their own languages, publish periodicals, and create literature and art.
    However, imperialists, Kuomintang reactionary agents, and some reactionary bourgeois nationalists, such as pan-Turkists and pan-Islamists, are still carrying out various reactionary propaganda activities, attempting to divert the attention of the broad masses of the working people of various minority nationalities and undermine the unity of all nationalities within the People's Republic of China. At the same time, among some of our cadres and youth, there are still various confused ideas about nationality issues. In youth movements and in their work, when raising issues, they consciously or unconsciously exhibit right-wing or "left-wing" tendencies, such as narrow nationalism, Han chauvinism, and ethnic discrimination. These tendencies are not conducive to friendship and mutual respect among nationalities, and hinder the consolidation and development of the united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.
    The purpose of my writing this short article is to simply discuss the reactionary essence of pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism, the criteria for national movements, the Chinese Communist Party's nationality policy, and our current tasks. I hope that readers and comrades who study nationality issues will offer criticism and correction!
    I. The Reactionary Essence of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Islamism
    I intend to first talk about pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism, because even now many people do not understand the essence of these two ideologies and have thus become their prisoners. So-called pan-Turkism advocates that all Turkic-speaking tribes and races should unite to establish a large Turkic state under Turkish rule. It believes that all Turkic-speaking tribes and races should form a "nation." So-called pan-Islamism advocates that all tribes and races that believe in Islam (the Muslim religion) should unite as a whole, with the Turkish "Caliph" as the Pope. It believes that all tribes and races that believe in Islam should form a "nation." Here, a question arises: What is a nation? In 1913, in his book "Marxism and the National Question," Stalin gave the following definition of a nation based on scientific historical research:
    "A nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people formed on the basis of a common language, a common territory, a common economic life, and a common psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.
    At the same time, it goes without saying that a nation, like any historical phenomenon, is subject to the laws of change; it has its own history, its own beginning and end."
    According to Stalin's definition, only when these characteristics are present can a nation be formed. If one of them is missing, it is not a nation.
    From this, it can be seen that all Turkic-speaking people cannot constitute a "nation" because they do not have a common territory, a common economic life, or a common psychological make-up. Similarly, all people who believe in Islam cannot constitute a nation.
    From this, it can be seen that the "national" theories of pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism, which take "language family" and "religion" as their starting points, are completely wrong.
    Imperialists often use pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism as their tools. Many examples can be given to illustrate this point.
    After the outbreak of the great October Socialist Revolution, imperialists such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, as well as German fascists and all counter-revolutionaries—White Russians, pan-Islamists, pan-Turkists, bourgeois nationalists, and Trotskyites—colluded to carry out activities against the Soviet regime in Central Asia.
    In 1924, after the collapse of the Caliph (King and Pope—author) system in Turkey, British imperialists seized this opportunity to implement their aggressive policies. They attempted to establish a Caliph (Pope) system in India. To this end, they convened meetings in Mecca, Cairo, and Jerusalem to promote the Caliph system and widely promote pan-Islamism. They disguised Britain as a country that supported Islam.
    The fascists of Germany and Italy did not stand idly by either. In order to realize their aggressive policies, they also widely used pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism, and they also pretended to be protectors of Islam.
    In order to turn all of China into their colony, Japanese imperialists sent their lackeys to various parts of China, especially to the Muslim people of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, disguising Japan as the "protector of Islam," provoking Muslims to oppose the Han people, and attempting to separate Xinjiang from China in order to establish a puppet Muslim state. In 1931, when the national liberation movement against the feudal lords and the Jin Shuren regime of warlords broke out in Hami, Xinjiang Province, Japanese imperialists sent a large number of spies, special agents, and traitors to Xinjiang to seize the leadership of this movement. Japanese imperialism also instructed the descendants of the former Turkish Caliph to establish a puppet East Turkestan Republic in Kashgar. British imperialists used pan-Islamists such as Muhammad Amin Bughra and Sabit Damulla to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in southern Xinjiang. These activities of Japanese and British imperialism, on the one hand, attempted to penetrate deep into China's rear and prepare to implement their large-scale aggression plan, and on the other hand, attempted to establish a base against the mainstay of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp—the Soviet Union. If this counter-revolutionary puppet East Turkestan Republic had been realized, then Xinjiang would have become an imperialist colony, and the people of Xinjiang would have become their slaves. Therefore, all progressive forces in Xinjiang at that time united to oppose this aggression by Japan and Britain, and disbanded the puppet East Turkestan Republic in a timely manner. In this way, the people of Xinjiang also avoided being trampled by the iron hooves of imperialism.
    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialists, in order to undermine the united front of the Chinese people's revolution and turn China into an American colony, also used pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism as tools. They widely promoted pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism among Chinese Muslims. They attempted to unite the Muslims of Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, and Xinjiang in the Northwest region to establish a puppet Muslim state headed by the warlord Ma Bufang. Ma Chengxiang, the commander of Ma Bufang's troops stationed in Xinjiang, colluded with all the counter-revolutionary elements in Xinjiang, such as Muhammad Amin Bughra, Isa Alptekin, Osman Batur, Janim Khan, Yaqup Beg, and Masud Sabri, to carry out activities against the Chinese people's revolution and against the Soviet Union with the support of American imperialism's agents in Xinjiang.
    From the facts mentioned above, we can see for whose interests pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism serve, and who the people with such ideas are acting as agents for. Of course, I am not saying here that those who unconsciously accept the influence of pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism are all pan-Islamists or pan-Turkists; a distinction should be made. But at the same time, I must point out that those who have been influenced should wake up and consciously break away from this influence.
    II. The Criteria for National Movements
    The content of national movements and the methods for solving national issues change with the development of history. Marxism-Leninism believes that in the era of imperialism, the national question is part of the overall question of the socialist revolution. Stalin said: "The national question is part of the general problem of revolutionary development; at various stages of the revolution, the national question has various different tasks corresponding to the nature of the revolution in each given historical period. The Party's policy on the national question must also be changed accordingly." (Stalin, "The National Question and Leninism")
    History tells us that national movements are not absolute; some are progressive, and some are reactionary. What is the standard here? It is the interest of the revolution, the "actual results in the final reckoning of the anti-imperialist struggle" (Stalin). If a certain national movement does not raise the class consciousness of the broad masses, the broad working people, but uses various fabricated ideas, superstitions, or religious names to anesthetize their minds, cover up the class struggle, preach narrow nationalism, incite hatred and distrust between nationalities, magnify very small problems to make them a pretext for opposing another nationality, put the personal interests of leaders above the interests of the broad people—workers and peasants, and regard the shortcomings and things that do not suit their tastes of one person of another nationality as the affairs of the entire nationality, then this national movement is reactionary, because the purpose of this movement is not to protect the interests of the broad working masses, not to improve their lives, but to exploit and plunder them; not to develop the class struggle of the working masses of their own nationality, but to use the narrow nationalist sentiments of the masses to oppose other nationalities in order to seek their own class interests. As for so-called national movements that are not aimed at opposing imperialism, but at colluding with imperialism, it goes without saying.
    Let me give two examples. For example, the national liberation movements that broke out in Hotan and Kashgar regions of Xinjiang in 1932-1933 were reactionary national movements because they were led by Muhammad Amin Bughra, Shaman Mansur, Sabit Damulla, Kyrgyz Osman, and others. In the struggle against the old reactionary rule, they not only did not oppose imperialism, but colluded with British, American, and Japanese imperialism. They did not weaken but increased the influence of imperialism in Xinjiang. Similarly, before the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949, the national liberation movements clamored by reactionary nationalists, pan-Turkists, and pan-Islamist groups such as Muhammad Amin Bughra, Isa Alptekin, Ma Chengxiang, and Masud Sabri were all reactionary because they were all running dogs of American and British imperialism and were all traitors.
    On the other hand, the national liberation movement that broke out in Yili in 1944 and later included the Tacheng and Ashan regions was a revolutionary movement because it opposed imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime. It was part of the overall movement of the Chinese people's revolution, and it stood on the side of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the great Soviet Union.
    Now that the Chinese people have overthrown the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, established the People's Republic of China, and established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, if a national movement demanding separation from the People's Republic of China and independence is carried out at this time, it will become reactionary, because it objectively undermines the interests of all nationalities, especially the interests of the vast majority of the people of its own nationality, and only benefits imperialism. Therefore, any movement is related to conditions, place, and time. What was advanced in one era may become reactionary in another. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the era and the stage of revolutionary development. (To be continued)

### 在中国共产党的领导下，为加强各民族的友好团结而斗争

　　在中国共产党的领导下，为加强各民族的友好团结而斗争
    鲍尔汉
    满清政府、北洋军阀以及后来的国民党反动政权，对于少数民族所实行的政策，是压迫少数民族，实行同化政策，造成民族仇视，阻碍各少数民族的文化经济的进步发展。现在中国人民革命获得了全国范围内的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，树立了人民民主专政，这时国内各少数民族才获得了解放，成了中华人民共和国大家庭里边的有平等权利的成员。在中国共产党领导下，中央人民政府实行了正确的无产阶级的民族政策，给各民族开辟了政治、经济、文化迅速发展的康庄大道。从来没有文字和字母的民族，现在有了创造自己文字，用自己语言编写课本、出版刊物、创作文艺等的机会。
    但是帝国主义者，国民党反动派的特务，以及一部分反动的资产阶级民族主义者，例如大土耳其主义者、大伊斯兰主义者们，还在进行种种反动宣传，企图转移各少数民族广大劳动群众的视线，破坏中华人民共和国内各族的团结。同时，在我们的有些干部及青年中间，对于民族问题还有种种糊涂观念，他们在青年运动中，在工作中，提出问题时，有意识地或不自觉地表现了右的或“左”的倾向，如狭隘民族主义倾向、大民族主义倾向、民族歧视倾向等。这些倾向不利于各族间的友谊与互相尊重，阻碍着反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义斗争的统一战线之巩固和发展。
    我写这篇短文的目的，就在简单地讲讲大土耳其主义和大伊斯兰主义的反动实质，讲讲民族运动的标准，中国共产党的民族政策，以及我们目前的任务等问题。希望读者和研究民族问题的同志们，加以批评和指正！
    一  大土耳其主义和大伊斯兰主义的反动实质
    我打算首先来讲讲大土耳其主义和大伊斯兰主义，因为直到现在还有好多人不了解这两种思想的实质，从而作了它们的俘虏。所谓大土耳其主义，是主张一切突厥语系的部落、种族联合起来，建立
    一个服从土耳其统治的大土耳其国家。它认为凡说突厥语的部落、种族，应当组成一个“民族”。所谓大伊斯兰主义，是主张凡信仰伊斯兰教（回教）的部落、种族联合起来，成为一个整体，以土耳其的“哈力法”为教皇。它认为凡信仰伊斯兰教的一切部落、种族，应当组成一个“民族”。这里就发生了一个问题：什么是民族？斯大林在一九一三年在“马克思主义与民族问题”一书中按照科学的历史研究对于民族作了如下的定义：
    “民族是历史上形成的一个有共同言语、有共同地域、有共同经济生活以及有表现于共同文化上的共同心理状态的人们的稳定的共同体。
    同时，不言而喻，民族，也像任何历史现象一样，是受变化律支配的，它有自己的历史，有自己的始末。”
    依照斯大林的规定，只有具备了上边所引的这些特点，才可构成一个民族，如果缺少一点，就不成为民族。
    由此可知，一切突厥语系的人民，并不能构成一个“民族”，因为他们并无共同的地域，共同的经济生活，共同的心理状态。同样，信仰伊斯兰教的一切人民，更不能构成一个民族。
    由此可知，大土耳其主义和大伊斯兰主义以“语系”和“宗教”为出发点的“民族”理论，是彻头彻尾地错误的。
    帝国主义者经常利用大土耳其主义、大伊斯兰主义做他们的工具。关于这一点，可举出许多例子来。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命爆发以后，英、美、法、日等帝国主义者和德国法西斯主义者以及所有一切反革命分子——白俄，大伊斯兰主义者、大土耳其主义者、资产阶级民族主义者、托洛斯基派，都勾结在一起，在中亚细亚进行了反对苏维埃政权的活动。
    一九二四年，土耳其的哈力法（国王兼教皇——著者）制度覆灭以后，英帝国主义者们就利用这个时机来实行他们的侵略政策。他们曾经企图在印度建立哈力法（教皇）制度。为了这事，他们在麦加、开罗、耶路撒冷等地召开了宣传哈力法制度的会议，大肆宣传大伊斯兰主义。他们把英国伪装为拥护伊斯兰教的国家。
    以前德意志、意大利的法西斯主义者也没有袖手旁观。它们为了实现自己的侵略政策，也广泛地利用了大伊斯兰主义和大土耳其主义，他们也假装成为伊斯兰教的保护者。
    日本帝国主义者们，为了把全中国变成他们的殖民地，曾派遣他们的走狗到中国各地，特别是到甘肃、青海、宁夏、新疆回教人民中间活动，把日本伪装为“回教的保护者”，挑拨回教徒反对汉族，企图使新疆与中国分离，以便成立伪回教国。一九三一年新疆省哈密掀起反对封建主和军阀金树仁政权的民族解放运动时，日本帝国主义者更派大批间谍、特务、奸细到新疆活动，企图夺取这一运动的领导权。日本帝国主义并指使前土耳其哈力法的后裔，在喀什成立了伪东土耳其斯坦共和国。英国帝国主义者在南疆利用大伊斯兰主义者穆罕默德伊敏博格拉、沙比提大毛拉等人进行反革命活动。日、英帝国主义的这种活动，一方面企图深入中国的后方，准备实行其大规模的侵略计划，另方面企图建立反对全世界和平、民主、社会主义阵营的支柱——苏联的根据地。如果这种反革命的伪东土耳其斯坦共和国实现的话，那么，新疆就会变成帝国主义的殖民地，新疆人民就要给他们当奴隶了。所以新疆当时的一切先进力量联合起来，反对日本和英国的这种侵略活动，及时解散了伪东土耳其斯坦共和国。这样，新疆人民也就避免了帝国主义铁蹄的蹂躏。
    在抗日战争胜利以后，美帝国主义者们为了破坏中国人民革命的统一战线和为了把中国变为美国的殖民地，也利用大伊斯兰主义和大土耳其主义做为工具。他们在中国回教徒中间广为宣传大伊斯兰主义和大土耳其主义，他们企图在西北地区，联合青海、宁夏、甘肃、新疆的回教徒们，建立以军阀马步芳为首的伪回教国。而马步芳的驻新部队的军长马呈祥，则与新疆的一切反革命分子，如穆罕默德伊敏博格拉、艾沙伯克、乌斯满、贾尼木汗、尧乐博斯、马恕基等辈勾结在一起，在美帝国主义在新疆的代理人的支持下，进行反对中国人民革命和反对苏联的活动。
    从上面所举的这事实中，我们可以看到，大伊斯兰主义和大土耳其主义是为谁的利益而服务的，抱有那种思想的人是做了谁的代理人。自然我这里不是说那些不自觉地接受了大伊斯兰主义和大土耳其主义影响的人们都是大伊斯兰主义者或大土耳其主义者，这是应当加以区别的。但同时我得指出，受了这种影响的人们应当觉悟过来，自觉地脱离这种影响。
    二  民族运动的标准
    民族运动的内容和解决民族问题的方法是随着历史的发展而变化的。马列主义认为，在帝国主义时代，民族问题是社会主义革命的总问题的一部分。斯大林说：“民族问题是革命发展的总问题的一部分；在各个不同的革命阶段上，民族问题具有着与每一既定历史时期的革命性质相应的各种不同的任务。党的关于民族问题的政策，也是要依照这点而改变的。”（斯大林：“民族问题与列宁主义”）
    历史告诉我们：民族运动不是绝对的东西，它有先进的，也有反动的。这里标准是什么呢？就是革命的利益，就是“反帝国主义斗争总结算中的实际结果”（斯大林）。如果某一民族运动，不是在提高广大群众、广大劳动人民的阶级意识，而是用各种捏造的思想、迷信或者宗教名义来麻醉他们的头脑，遮掩阶级斗争，说教狭隘的民族主义，鼓吹民族间的仇视和不信任，把很小的问题扩大起来使之成为反对另一个民族的藉口，把领导者私人利益看得高于广大人民——劳动者、农民的利益，把其他民族的某一个人的缺点和不合他们口味的事情看做整个民族的事情，那末这种民族运动就是反动的，因为这种运动的目的，不是在于保护广大劳动群众的利益，不是在于改善他们的生活，而是在于为了剥削和掠夺他们；不是在于展开本民族劳动大众的阶级斗争，而是在于利用群众的狭隘民族主义情绪来反对其他民族借以谋取自己的阶级利益。至于那种不是在于反对帝国主义，而是在于和帝国主义勾结的所谓民族运动，更不待说了。
    举两个例子。例如一九三二—一九三三年在新疆和阗、喀什两地区爆发的民族解放运动，就是反动的民族运动，因为领导运动的是穆罕默德伊敏博格拉、夏满素尔、沙比提大毛拉、吉尔吉斯乌斯满等。他们在反对旧的反动统治的斗争中不但不反对帝国主义，而且勾结英、美、日本帝国主义，他们不是削弱了而是增长了帝国主义在新疆的影响。同样，一九四九年在新疆解放以前，反动的民族主义者、大土耳其主义者、大伊斯兰主义者集团如穆罕默德伊敏博格拉、艾沙伯克、马呈祥、马恕基等所叫嚣的民族解放运动，也都是反动的，因为他们都是美英帝国主义的走狗，都是卖国贼。
    另一方面，一九四四年在伊犁爆发而后来包括塔城、阿山两区的民族解放运动，却是革命的运动，因为它是反对帝国主义，反对国民党反动派政权的，它是全中国人民革命总运动的一部分，它是站在以伟大苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营方面的。
    现在中国人民已经推翻了国民党反动派的黑暗统治，成立了中华人民共和国，建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，在这时，如果进行要求脱离中华人民共和国而独立的民族运动，那就成为反动的了，因为它在客观上破坏了各民族首先是本民族最大多数人民的利益，而仅仅有利于帝国主义。所以任何一个运动，都是与条件、地点、时间相联系的。在一个时代里成为先进的东西，在另一个时代里就有成为反动的可能。因此，认清时代与革命的发展阶段，是很必要的。（未完）
