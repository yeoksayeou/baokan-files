To the Editor:

A drying room built by the Tianjin Chemical Plant, under the Tianjin Industrial Bureau, suffered cracking in the roof after completion due to design errors and hasty construction. It must be demolished and rebuilt, resulting in a loss of approximately 87 million yuan. The project was designed by Engineer Sun of the Beiyang Engineering Company and officially began construction on April 1st.

The reasons for the error in this project are, firstly, that Engineer Sun made the mistake in the design of relying solely on experience without scientific design. For example, indoor ventilation equipment was not included in the design; the indoor ground plane was unsuitable for use and was temporarily modified. Secondly, the Tianjin Chemical Plant had a serious mentality of being eager for quick success and an irresponsible reliance on the engineer's ideas. Only one month elapsed from the planning and design of the project, submission to the Industrial Bureau for review, to the start of construction. The relevant units did not carefully study the problems in the design; the plant also believed that it had no conditions to review the design, and therefore blindly trusted the engineer's design. Thirdly, the Tianjin Industrial Bureau only reviewed the engineering design in terms of labor and materials, without deeply studying the problems in the design, and rashly approved it; when the project was nearing completion, cracks were found in the baking wall, and the arched wall near the foundation showed signs of outward movement. Instead of fundamentally trying to correct it, they blindly approved the method of reinforcement, resulting in the ultimate loss of an irreparable roof crack.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau also bears certain responsibility for failing to detect errors when reviewing the design of the project and for failing to conduct a detailed study of the reinforcement project, providing correct guidance, and lightly approving it.

    天津工业管理局等对基本建设不够负责，一项工程即浪费八千余万元
    编辑同志：天津公营工业管理局所属天津化学厂建造的一座干燥室，由于设计错误与仓促施工，致完工后室顶裂开，必须拆除重建，计损失约八千七百余万元。该工程系由北洋工程司孙工程师设计，于四月一日正式施工。这个工程发生错误的原因，首先是因为孙工程师在设计上犯了仅凭经验、没有科学设计的错误，比如室内通风设备就未列入设计；室内地平面不合使用而临时修改。其次是天津化学厂存在着严重的急于求成与不负责任的依赖工程师的思想。该工程自计划设计、呈请工业局审查至施工只有一个月的时间，有关单位未仔细研究设计上所存在的问题；该厂又认为自己无审查设计的条件，因而盲目信赖工程师的设计。第三是天津工业管理局仅从用工用料方面来审核工程设计，并未深入研究设计中的问题即冒然批准；当工程将告完竣时，发现烘烤墙上有裂缝，以及拱壁靠地基部分有外移的现象时，未从基本上设法改正，盲目批准了加固工程的办法，以致最后造成室顶裂缝无法补救的损失。
    天津市人民政府建设局在审查该项工程设计时，未能发现错误，对加固工程又未详细研究，给以正确的指导，而轻予批准，也应负一定的责任。
