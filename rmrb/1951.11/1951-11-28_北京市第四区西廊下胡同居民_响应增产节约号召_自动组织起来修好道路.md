To the Editor:

We are the residents of Xilangxia Hutong, Gongmenkou, Fourth District, Beijing. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, we couldn't even take care of our lives, and felt that each day was just one day closer to the end.

Since the liberation of Beijing more than two years ago, especially since the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, our patriotic enthusiasm has increased. Everyone feels that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, life is getting better and more interesting. When we heard Chairman Mao's call for the people of the whole country to increase production and practice thrift, and to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, everyone immediately responded. In less than five days, we completed and overfulfilled our half-year patriotic donation plan ahead of schedule. Some time ago, we heard that the government was going to repair the road for us. Everyone thought: if we repair this road ourselves, wouldn't that be responding to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift, and saving the country a sum of money? After discussing it with each other, everyone agreed to repair it ourselves. At first, we were worried that we wouldn't be able to repair it well; when we thought of our volunteers fighting the American devils on the front line, and overcoming so many difficulties, how could we not overcome this little difficulty? How could we be worthy of the volunteer comrades? So everyone's courage came, and we decided: on the principle of not hindering production, we would take two hours a day to repair the road. Those with some skills did the fine work, those without skills dug the hard soil, and the women sprinkled water. In thirteen days, the road was repaired. After calculating, we saved the country a wealth of four hundred catties of millet.

This matter was praised by the District People's Government, and everyone felt excited and uneasy. Because this is a very small matter! We have all expressed our determination: in the future, we must more actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, practice strict economy, increase production, and support our most beloved people - the People's Volunteers.

The entire residents of Xilangxia Hutong, Fourth District, Beijing

    北京市第四区西廊下胡同居民
    响应增产节约号召
    自动组织起来修好道路
    编辑同志：我们是北京市第四区宫门口西廊下胡同的居民。在国民党反动统治时期，我们连生活都顾不上，只觉得活一天少一天。
    北京解放两年多以来，特别是自从伟大的抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动以来，我们的爱国热情提高了。大家觉得，在毛主席和共产党领导下，日子越过越美，越过越有意思。当我们听到毛主席号召全国人民增产节约，继续加强抗美援朝工作后，大家马上响应。不到五天，我们就把半年的爱国捐献计划提前并超额完成了。前些日子听说政府要给我们修路，大家想：这条路要是咱自己修，不就是响应了毛主席增产节约的号召，给国家节省一笔钱吗？互相一商量，大家都赞成自己修。刚开始，我们担心修不好；一想到咱们志愿军在前线打美国鬼子，那么多困难都能克服，咱们连这一点困难都克服不了，怎能对得起志愿军同志？于是大家的勇气就来了，并决定：在不妨碍生产的原则下，每天抽出两小时时间修路。有点技术的做细活，没有技术的挖硬土，妇女们泼水，一共十三天，就把路修好了。一合算，共给国家节省了四百斤小米的财富。
    这件事情，得到了区人民政府的表扬，大家觉得又兴奋又不安。因为这是一件极小的事呀！我们都表示了决心：今后要更积极地响应毛主席的号召，厉行节约，增加生产，支持我们最可爱的人——人民志愿军。
