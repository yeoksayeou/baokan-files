　  Political Study Must Solve Practical Problems
    Jin Kemu, Professor, Department of Oriental Languages, Peking University

    Now our university teachers have begun a political study movement for self-reform. I think the first thing we must learn is to be a revolutionary cadre, a worker, a true trade union member, and an educator. This is also learning to be the master of the country. We all come from the old society. If we don't turn ourselves over in our thinking and join the revolutionary ranks, if we don't completely give ourselves to the country, how can we intimately feel that the country is our own? If we don't resolutely side with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and resolutely shatter the ideological shackles that the old society gave us, but instead adopt an attitude of observing the revolution, how can we truly feel that we are a member of the people? To turn over in thinking is to completely change our position, resolutely stand in the ranks of the workers, become intellectuals of the working class, and become revolutionary cadres of the people. What can we use to test our position and the extent of our study and transformation? I think it is when there are contradictions between personal interests, departmental interests, or even small group interests, and the interests of the country and the people. It is in such practical problems that we are tested. Personal interests must be subordinate to the interests of the country and the people, and partial interests must be subordinate to the interests of the whole. We must first examine whether our own thoughts, words, and actions all follow this principle.

    Criticism and self-criticism are our weapons for self-reform. Can we break through considerations of personal relationships, break through personal concerns, and boldly point out the shortcomings in our work and the problems in our thinking? This is a test. If we can do this, our learning can advance; if we cannot do this, we cannot pass this hurdle, and our learning will become empty talk. For the sake of improving our work, that is, for the sake of the interests of the country and the people, we must dare to criticize ourselves, criticize others, and criticize all phenomena that should be criticized.

    Peking University has a glorious revolutionary tradition. We often mention this glorious tradition. But do we therefore forget that Peking University also has an inglorious, non-revolutionary side to its history? The reason why Peking University's revolutionary tradition is revolutionary is because it constantly attacked the old dark forces. The revolutionary forces constantly fought against the reactionary forces, and finally the revolutionary forces won. This is the law of development of Peking University. In the era of the May Fourth Movement, there were also two forces in Peking University, new and old, there was the "New Tide," and there was also "National Essence," there was Professor Li Dazhao, and there was also Professor Gu Hongming. The reason why President Cai Yuanpei's "inclusiveness" was progressive at the time was because he accommodated progressive, revolutionary Marxists, not because he accommodated royalists. What we are proud of today and want to inherit and carry forward is only the revolutionary tradition, the Marxist tradition, and the tradition of constantly fighting against evil forces. If we think that Peking University has a general tradition, and are complacent with the glory of the past and conceal our shortcomings and stay where we are, then we people at Peking University, whether we are senior professors or younger learners like myself, have betrayed Peking University's revolutionary tradition.

    Does Peking University have any shortcomings today? I don't think anyone would say that our work is already perfect and without any flaws. In the study of ideological remolding, we must point out our shortcomings and investigate the ideological reasons for their occurrence. Only in this way can we move forward. Only in this way can we conform to the interests of the country and the people.

    As far as I can see, a serious shortcoming that Peking University has not yet eliminated is the lack of clear ideological leadership, and thus it also shows that it does not truly value political and ideological education.

    Since liberation, the Peking University authorities have not announced the specific guidelines and directions for the school's work. This means that the people's government's higher education policy has not yet been integrated with the specific conditions of the school and implemented, and therefore a period of work tasks and central links cannot be accurately specified. This makes it impossible for everyone to clearly understand the direction and path of work, and it also makes it impossible to establish standards of public right and wrong, and to carry out correct commendation and criticism to promote work. Administrative leaders are indeed busy with work, but please allow me to say boldly that this kind of work is often still passive, piecemeal work, and not work with goals, guidelines, plans, and steps. Without ideological leadership, only the organizational relationship of the administrative system is left to promote work, and all work lacks ideological content, and it is difficult to achieve a thorough transformation from the old style of administrative work before liberation. Everyone often only knows how to work, but does not know why they are working in this way. In this way, much work will become blind, routine, and purely technical. Even if the leaders have a clear idea in their minds, if it is not implemented in the minds of the masses, it is still equal to nothing, and everyone will inevitably still be blind.

    One of the results of the lack of political and ideological leadership is the lack of attention to political and ideological education, which should be integrated into all courses. Although the slogan of patriotic education is sung to the skies, when have the school authorities and department heads seriously discussed how to turn this slogan into reality? When have they checked whether the content of the courses is in line with patriotism? Although everyone says that our teaching content should be in line with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, when has the school authorities paid attention to whether everyone's understanding is consistent, whether it is correct, and to what extent it conforms?

    If general political and ideological education is not valued, how can the year-one Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought education courses, which are school-wide, receive special attention? Every semester, it is not until the beginning of the semester that teachers of "Social Development History" or "New Democracy Theory" are put together. The content of the course and the requirements of the students are increasing year by year, the teaching work is becoming more and more difficult every semester, and the teaching organization has also been changed from the teaching committee to the teaching research and guidance group this semester, but the teachers are constantly flowing and constantly decreasing. None of the department heads has ever inquired about the learning situation of the first-year students of Marxism-Leninism in their department, as if this public compulsory course is not at the same time the most important course in their department. Therefore, some students fail, even for two consecutive semesters, and they do not make up for it. The department head does not consider how to deal with it, as if what they manage is only so-called professional work, and they never ask about political thought. Under such circumstances, how can students be made to change their purely technical viewpoints? Political and ideological education is difficult to avoid the danger of "everyone spreading it, and the people of Chu shouting it" from the perspective of the course. As for the training of teachers of Marxism-Leninism and current affairs study, even less attention has been paid to it. It was not until this semester, due to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, that teaching assistants in this area were retained, and a teaching assistant was transferred to Renmin University to study. In the future, as the number of students increases, these two courses will become more burdensome, and how to proceed has not yet been considered by the educational administration authorities.

    Since there is no unified ideological leadership, departmentalism in which everyone does their own thing will naturally emerge. I might as well give a few examples here. One example is the situation of the library. Almost every department has its own library. Each department buys and manages its own books, often takes books from the school library, and restricts borrowing by people from other departments. The school library only stamps and catalogues the books of each department, and cannot ask about anything else. Because there is no unified leadership, there is no plan for buying books, and they are often duplicated; because there is no unified management, the department libraries do not have strict systems, and no one asks about the situation of the department libraries, and even a large number of books are lost; because the book funds are distributed to each department according to the number of students in each department, the school library, in addition to ordering a few newspapers and magazines, can only buy a very small number of books to decorate it every month. The school library does not have enough rooms, and it is necessary and convenient to be dispersed, but should this state of anarchy be allowed?

    For example, the Law School has a "New Jurisprudence Research Office," an "Administrative Research Office," and a "Chinese Economic History Research Office." They all have offices, people, books, and of course funds, but what work do they do? What achievements have they made? Are they in line with the needs of the country and the people?

    For example, Professor Fan Hong, the head of the Economics Department, was a member of the former school affairs committee, but in the meetings of the former school affairs committee, which presided over the school's administration, he repeatedly fought for the number of professors in his economics department, insisting on passing the professors he hired, and even "throwing his hat" on the spot, completely forgetting that he was one of the school's leaders participating in the handling of school-wide issues. At that time, there may have been more than just him as a school affairs committee member who lacked an overall view, but Professor Fan Hong is a Communist Party member, and Communist Party members advocate criticism and self-criticism, so I am pointing out his name here.

    The idea of only caring about one's own department or even only caring about oneself and not caring about the whole is also reflected in the relationship between the school and other schools. This is known to people who understand the situation of higher education in Beijing.

    Let me give a small example. The Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University has a Tibetan language section. The Nationalities Institute runs another identical Tibetan language section, but it does not have teachers, so it pulls the Tibetan language teachers and students from Peking University to attend classes together. Peking University does not therefore cancel the Tibetan language section. So this teacher works at the Nationalities Institute, but receives his salary and participates in the trade union and learning at Peking University, and the two sides do not cooperate. Two students from Peking University attend classes at the Nationalities Institute. Some of their grades are sent to Peking University, and some of their grades are sent to the Nationalities Institute. Why can't the two schools negotiate to solve this problem? Why don't the superiors who lead the two schools care about such a phenomenon?

    (Here, I can also use schools outside Peking University as an example. I heard that the Department of Philosophy at Yenching University has very few teachers, and some students have to go to Tsinghua University to attend classes. Why must the students take classes on one side and register on the other side, and can't they discuss combining the strength of the philosophy departments of the two schools?)

    In places where there is a lack of ideological leadership, vulgar liberalistic habits will naturally spread.

    The first manifestation of this vulgar liberalism is tolerance of reactionary ideas. A student in the Department of Oriental Languages once openly sang the Kuomintang party song in the classroom, and no one cared about it. Associate Professor Yu Mingchuan of the Department of Western Languages, although a Communist Party member, retained the ideas of the landlord class. It was not until a serious incident of sheltering counter-revolutionary elements occurred that he was discovered by the higher party committee and expelled from the party. In the school, no one within or outside the party had ever discovered his serious erroneous thinking. Mutual lack of concern for ideas and therefore dull political sense is a natural product of vulgar liberalism.

    Vulgar liberalism is also manifested in teaching. For example, "Literary Theory" in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature is a major course. People teach it in universities all over the country, but the teaching content and teaching methods may not be the same. Everyone says that it is based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, but who is true and who is false? Who is short and who is long? Even if it is inconvenient to discuss it on a national scale, the several teachers who teach the course in Beijing should always study together regularly to obtain a consistent understanding to teach, right? They should always raise some difficult questions and different opinions to discuss, right? But I have not heard of such a thing. Is this the old academic style or the new academic style?

    The department head also adopts a liberalistic attitude towards the courses and teachers in his department. Each department did not prescribe exactly what kind of talents to cultivate with a serious attitude of being responsible to the people. The Ministry of Education convened a curriculum reform meeting and stipulated the tasks of each department. These regulations have not been tested in the school through the practice of the masses, and have not been mastered by every teacher and student. If the guidelines and tasks are not clear, it is impossible to say what kind of work students can do in what positions after graduation. The department head only arranges courses and assigns teachers. As for whether the course content is coordinated with each other, whether it is appropriate for someone to teach a certain course, and more importantly, whether the actual content of the teaching is consistent with the magnificent name of the course, whether such teaching can guarantee the cultivation of students to the predetermined talent standards, these do not seem to be within the consideration of the department head. They have never checked the teaching content, made criticisms or commendations, and made them public. I believe that if the department head really checks the content of many courses, he will at least find that many courses with the banner of Marxism-Leninism are selling non-Marxist-Leninist goods. Because they do not check, and do not consider it from the actual need to cultivate talents, it is natural that the true and false cannot be distinguished, and the superior and inferior cannot be distinguished. The department head, who bears the heavy responsibility of cultivating high-level construction talents for the country, cares about the faces of his colleagues more than he cares about the students' studies. Is this not a kind of vulgar habit? The fact that the course content does not meet the actual needs is a serious problem. It is not seen that any professors have thought about this: if they were their own students today, and learned what they taught, what practical work could they do besides being a professor? The department head's liberalistic attitude towards the courses in his department, and his failure to strictly check whether the tasks of his department can be completed, is a phenomenon in the entire blind teaching, and is a manifestation of the separation of theory and practice.

    In short, the Common Program's cultural and educational policy does not seem to have been thoroughly implemented at Peking University. Our teaching content is not necessarily national, scientific, and popular, and the teaching method is not consistent with theory and practice. I think this is what we should deeply examine in this study.

    I know very little about Peking University and higher education issues. The above-mentioned opinions may not be correct, but since I have seen these problems, I have the responsibility to raise them and ask for clarification. In any case, I believe that as long as we admit that we are national cadres, and admit that personal interests are subordinate to national interests, these kinds of problems will not be difficult to solve in the process of transforming our thinking, and our thinking can also be improved by solving practical problems. Otherwise, if we talk about transforming our thinking without being connected to reality, our study will certainly not achieve its purpose.

　  政治学习必须解决实际问题
    北京大学东方语文系教授　金克木
    现在我们高等学校教师开始了自我改造的政治学习运动。我想我们首先要学习做一个革命干部，做一个工人，做一个名符其实的工会会员，教育工作者，这也就是学习做国家的主人。我们都是从旧社会中来，如果不在思想上翻个身，加入到革命队伍中来，不把自己完全交给国家，怎能亲切感觉到国家是自己的？如果不坚决倒向工农兵一边，不坚决粉碎旧社会给我们的思想镣铐，而采取旁观革命的态度，怎能真正感觉到自己是人民的一分子？在思想上翻身就是彻底改变立场，坚决站进工人的队伍，做工人阶级的知识分子，做人民的革命干部。拿什么来考验我们的立场，来考验我们学习改造的程度？我想就是在个人利益、本位利益乃至小集团利益和国家利益、人民利益有了矛盾的关头上，在这样的实际问题上考验。个人利益要服从国家人民利益，局部利益要服从全体利益。我们首先要检查自己的思想言论行动是否都遵照这个原则。
    批评和自我批评是我们自我改造的武器。我们能不能破除情面，破除个人顾虑，而大胆指摘我们工作中的缺点和思想上的问题？这就是一个考验。能够这样，我们的学习就可以前进；不能这样，就是过不了这一关，学习就要成为空谈。为了工作的改进，也就是为了国家人民的利益，我们必须敢于批评自己，批评别人，批评一切应该批评的现象。
    北京大学是有光荣的革命传统的。我们常常提到这个光荣传统。但是我们是不是因此就忘记了北京大学同样也有不光荣不革命的历史一面？北京大学的革命传统之所以为革命，就是因为它不断对旧的黑暗势力进攻。革命的力量不断对反动的力量斗争而最后革命力量胜利，这就是北京大学的发展规律。在五四运动时代，北京大学里面也有新旧两种势力，有“新潮”，也有“国故”，有李大钊教授，也有辜鸿铭教授。蔡孑民校长当时的“兼容并包”之所以有进步意义，是因为他容了进步的革命的马克思主义者，并不是因为他容了保皇党。我们今天引以为光荣并且要承继和发扬的只是革命的传统，马克思主义的传统，对恶势力不断斗争的传统。如果我们竟以为北京大学有一个笼统的传统，竟以过去的光荣自满而隐讳缺点逗留不进，那么，我们在北京大学的人，不论是前辈先生或是我这样的末学后进，就是背弃了北京大学的革命传统。
    今天的北京大学有没有缺点？我想任何人也不会说我们的工作已经尽善尽美毫无缺陷。在思想改造的学习中，我们就要指摘出我们的缺点并且追究其所以发生的思想原因。这样，我们才可以前进。这样才符合国家人民的利益。
    就我所见到的说，北京大学今天还没有消除的一个严重的缺点，就是缺少明确的思想领导，因而也表现出并不真正重视政治思想教育。
    解放以来，北京大学当局还没有宣布过学校工作的具体方针路线。这就是说，一直还没有把人民政府的高等教育政策结合到本校具体情况中来贯彻执行，因而也不能确切规定出一个时期中的工作任务和中心环节。这样使大家都不能明白认识工作的方向和道路，这样也不能树立公是公非的标准，不能展开正确的表扬和批评以推进工作。行政负责人的确是忙碌工作，但请让我大胆地说一句，可惜这种工作往往还是被动的枝枝节节的工作，还不是有目标有方针有计划有步骤的工作。没有思想领导，只剩下行政系统的组织关系来推动工作，一切工作就缺乏思想性，就难得从解放前的行政工作的老作风中实现彻底的转变。大家往往只知道工作，却不知道为什么要这样工作，这样，许多工作就会成为盲目的事务性的纯技术性的工作。即使领导人心中有数，但是若不贯彻到群众的思想中来，也还是等于没有，大家就免不了还是盲目。
    没有政治思想领导的结果之一，就是应该贯串在所有课程之中的政治思想教育的不被重视。尽管爱国主义教育的口号高唱入云，但是学校当局和院系负责人什么时候认真讨论过如何把这个口号变为事实？什么时候检查过课程内容是否合乎爱国主义？尽管大家都说我们的教学内容要符合马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想，但是什么时候学校当局注意过大家的了解是否一致，是否正确，究竟符合到什么程度？
    一般的政治思想教育不受重视，全校性的一年级马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想教育课程又何能独受重视？每一学期都是到了开学才拚凑“社会发展史”或“新民主主义论”的教员。课程内容和学生要求一年比一年提高，教学工作一学期比一学期困难，教学组织本学期也开始由教学委员会改为教学研究指导组，但是教员不断流动，不断减少。从没有一系的负责人过问本系一年级学生的马克思列宁主义课程的学习情况，仿佛这种公共必修课程并不同时是本系最重要的课程。因此有的学生不及格，甚至连续两学期，两门都不及格，也不补修，系主任并不去考虑怎样处理，似乎他们所管的只是所谓业务，决不过问政治思想。在这样的情形之下，如何能使学生改变单纯技术观点？政治思想教育从课程方面说就难于避免“一齐人传之，众楚人咻之”的危险。至于马克思列宁主义和时事学习的教员的培养更未受注意。到本学期由于教育部指示才留下这一方面的助教，才调一位助教去人民大学学习。以后学生人数增加，这两项课程也更加繁重，如何进行，教育行政当局似乎还没有考虑及此。
    既然没有统一的思想领导，也就自然会出现各自为政的本位主义。我在这里不妨随便举几个例子。一个例子是图书馆的情形。几乎每一系都有自己的图书馆。各系的书自己买，自己管，常从校图书馆提出书籍，对外系人借阅则加以限制。校图书馆只为各系的书盖章编目，其他不能过问。由于没有统一领导，买书就没有计划，往往重复；由于没有统一管理，系图书馆没有严密制度，系图书馆情况就无人过问，甚至大批丢书；由于图书经费照各系学生人数分配到各系去，校图书馆就除了定几份报纸杂志之外，每月只能买极少的书点缀一下。校图书馆房屋不够，分散固然有必要，也有方便，但这样的无政府状态是否应该？
    又如法学院有“新法学研究室”，“行政研究室”，“中国经济史研究室”，都有室，有人，有书，当然也有经费，但是做些什么工作？有了什么成绩？是否合乎国家人民的需要？
    又如经济系主任樊弘教授是以前的校务委员会委员，但是他在主持全校行政的前校务委员会的会议中却曾一再为他的经济系争教授名额，坚持通过他所聘任的教授，甚至当场“惯纱帽”，完全忘记他是全校负责人之一在参加处理全校性问题的会议。当时像这样的缺乏全面观点的校务委员或者还不止他一位，不过樊弘教授是共产党员，而共产党员是提倡批评和自我批评的，所以我在这里指出他的名字罢了。
    只顾本位甚至只顾个人而不顾全体的思想，也表现在学校对学校的关系上。这是了解北京高等教育情形的人们所都知道的。
    举一件小事作例子。北京大学东方语文系有藏文科。民族学院另办一个同样的藏文科，没有教员，把北京大学的藏文教员和学生一齐拉过去上课。北京大学并不因此取消藏文科。于是这位教员在民族学院工作，却在北京大学领薪和参加工会，参加学习，两头不配合。北京大学的两个学生在民族学院上课，有的成绩送到北京大学，有的成绩送到民族学院。为什么两个学校不能协商解决这个问题？为什么领导两个学校的上级也对这样的现象不管？
    （在这里，顺便也可以用北京大学以外的学校来作例子。听说燕京大学哲学系教员很少，有的学生要跑到清华大学去上课。两校为什么一定要学生这边上课那边记名，而不能商量一下把两校哲学系的力量合起来？）
    在缺少思想领导的地方，庸俗的自由主义习气就自然蔓延起来了。
    这种庸俗自由主义的表现首先是对于反动思想的容忍。东方语文系有一个学生曾公然在教室里当众唱国民党党歌，居然无人过问。西方语文系俞铭传副教授虽是共产党员，却保留了地主阶级思想，一直到发生了包庇反革命分子的严重事件时才由上级党委察觉予以开除党籍处分。平时在学校内竟不曾有党内党外的人发现过他的严重的错误思想。互不关心思想因而政治嗅觉迟钝，这正是庸俗自由主义的当然产物。
    庸俗自由主义也表现在教课方面。例如中国语文学系的《文艺学》是一门主要课程。全国各大学都有人教，其教学内容、教学方法就未必一致。大家都说是根据马列主义毛泽东思想，但谁真谁假？孰短孰长？纵使全国范围内不便商讨，同在北京的几位教课先生总应该经常共同研究以取得一致见解来教罢？总应该提出些困难问题和不同见解来讨论罢？却也没有听说有这样的事。这是旧学风还是新学风？
    系主任对待本系的课程和教员也是采取自由主义态度。各系并没有以严肃的对人民负责的态度规定下到底要培养什么样的人材。教育部召开课程改革会议，规定了各系任务。这些规定没有在学校中通过群众的实践来考验，也就没有为每一位教员学生所掌握。方针任务不明确，就说不出学生毕业后究竟能够在什么岗位上担当什么工作。系主任只是安排课程，分配教员，至于课程内容是否互相配合，某人教某课是否适当，更重要的是教学的实际内容是否与课程的堂皇名目相符，这样的教学能不能保证培养学生到预定的人材标准，这些似乎并不在系主任的考虑之列。他们从没有去检查教学内容，提出批评或表扬公诸大众。我相信，如果系主任真正检查一下许多课程的内容，他至少能发现不少挂着马列主义招牌的课程中贩卖着非马列主义的货色。因为不检查，不从实际培养人材的需要上考虑，自然真伪莫辨，优劣不分。负着为国家培养高级建设人材重任的系主任，对学生学业的关心不如对同事面子的关心，这难道不是一种庸俗习气？课程内容不符合实际需要是一个严重问题。不见得有教授想过：如果自己今天做自己的学生，学了自己教的这一套，除了当教授之外还能做什么实际工作？系主任对本系课程采取自由主义态度，不严格检查本系任务是否能够完成，这正是整个盲目教学中的一个现象，是理论与实际脱节的表现。
    总之，共同纲领的文化教育政策似乎还没有在北京大学彻底实现。我们的教学内容还不一定是民族的，科学的，大众的，而教学方法也不是理论实际一致。我觉得这就是我们应该在这次学习中深刻检讨的地方。
    我对于北京大学和高等教育问题所知很少，以上所说的意见，或者并不正确，但是我既然看到这些问题，就有责任提出来要求加以澄清。无论如何，我相信，只要我们承认自己是国家干部，承认个人利益服从国家利益，这一类的问题就不难在我们的改造思想过程中得到解决，我们的思想也可由解决实际问题而提高。否则，脱离实际而空谈改造思想，我们的学习就一定不能达到目的。
