Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign is the Central Task of the Country

At the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao proposed to us, and the meeting unanimously adopted, the task of "increasing production and practicing strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." This is the most important central task of our country at present, and the people of the whole country are actively taking action to strive to achieve this task. In order to launch a nationwide increase production and practice economy campaign, we believe that the goals and specific guidelines of this campaign must also be explained so that the people of the whole country can move in unison to complete this major task.

In order to further strengthen the power to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of the whole country must fully support the front and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and ensure the supply of materials to the front under the conditions of maintaining stable domestic prices and not excessively increasing the burden on the people. This can only be achieved by striving to increase production and practice strict economy. More importantly, in order to prepare for the country's large-scale construction in the future and accumulate the funds needed for various constructions, the people of the whole country must redouble their efforts to increase production and practice strict economy. It should be recognized that "increasing production and practicing economy" is not just a temporary means to solve certain difficulties, but a fundamental method for building a people's country. To industrialize our country, there must be a constantly increasing amount of funds. But where do these funds come from? In various imperialist countries, they generally adopt one or several of the following four methods to obtain funds for industrialization: (1) exploiting the domestic people, (2) plundering colonies, (3) forcing defeated countries to pay reparations, and (4) borrowing foreign debts. Our people's country should not adopt the first three methods, and borrowing foreign debts cannot be a primary method. Therefore, the funds for the industrialization of the people's country must be gradually accumulated from production such as agriculture and state-owned enterprises, and from savings in the fiscal budget. The experience of socialist Soviet Union in accumulating industrialization funds fully proves this point. Therefore, the source of funds for China's industrialization must also be sought from increasing production and practicing economy, which is the only correct path.

Some of the managers, technicians, and workers in our country's enterprises have been influenced by capitalist ideology, and some have become accustomed to the supply system of life and work style in the long revolutionary war, which has led them to be wasteful in enterprise management and production methods. We must correct this waste and implement the method of economic accounting. In agriculture, we must gradually change the extensive farming methods of farmers, organize them more extensively, and implement intensive cultivation to increase the yield per unit area. In governments at all levels, all units of the People's Liberation Army, people's organizations at all levels, and organizations of the Communist Party of China at all levels, we must continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of diligence, thrift, and hard struggle, and wage a resolute struggle against all extravagance, waste, and corruption. Carrying out a broad mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy in these aspects will be of great benefit to our country's construction cause.

The increase production and practice economy in state-owned enterprises and state organs and cooperatives will be the most effective. The increase production and practice economy movement in these enterprises and organs should be launched immediately in the following aspects:

First, the bureaucratic capitalist and imperialist enterprises we have taken over have a lot of equipment and materials in stock due to the past corrupt management. After we took over, due to lack of experience, we did not thoroughly clean them up, and in some places, some new materials were still in stock. This is even more serious in newly liberated areas. Before the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant determined its capital, one plant used the capital of two plants; the Xi'an Railway Bureau's inventory in June was almost ten times more than the required amount; the results of the inventory of the Zhuzhou Railway Factory in October showed that the factory occupied the capital equal to five factories. These phenomena of capital accumulation must be corrected immediately.

Second, many state-owned trade organs and factories and mines have caused great waste due to the slow turnover of working capital; accelerating the turnover of working capital can save a large amount of capital for the country. According to the statistics of factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department from January to August, among the more than 4 million tons of grain increased production and saved for the country in addition to completing the original state plan, the acceleration of working capital turnover accounted for 47.7%. This is the most obvious example, and all regions should learn from this experience.

Third, there is still a considerable amount of waste in basic construction investment in various regions. The losses caused by blind construction without correct exploration and design are very huge; there are many non-urgent tasks in various places, such as large auditoriums, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and large roads, which can be postponed; but due to lax financial supervision, they are arbitrarily carried out. This waste phenomenon should not continue to occur in the future.

Fourth, the efficiency of production and work should be greatly improved. The utilization rate of industrial equipment should be fully utilized first. The equipment utilization rate of the Northwest Machinery Industry System is only 29.3%; the current average utilization rate of national power equipment is only 35%; and the scrap rate of many state-owned factories is still very high. These situations should be changed in the increase production and practice economy movement.

Fifth, efforts should be continued to reduce costs. This mainly requires saving the use of raw materials and reducing management costs. Large materials should not be used for small purposes, and good materials should not be used for bad purposes, so as not to increase costs. The number of management personnel not required for production should not be too large, and unreasonable labor organizations should be changed immediately. These are also methods to reduce costs.

Sixth, the personnel establishment of state organs and enterprise organizations is still a great waste. Some organs overlap each other, and generally there are too many levels, and some organs are too large. Such institutions not only waste manpower and materials, but also seriously weaken the effectiveness of work. In connection with this, the budgets of some organs are huge and exceed the actual needs. This should also be corrected immediately. The system of submitting budget surpluses and grain surpluses should be established immediately.

Seventh, all extravagant and wasteful phenomena, such as banquets, commemorative meetings, receptions, and professional conferences, must be saved as much as possible; commemorative badges, commemorative albums, etc. should not be issued indiscriminately; unnecessary gifts should be exempted immediately; the use of cars and other items should also be strictly restricted; the phenomenon of some middle and senior cadres being too extravagant in their lives must be corrected.

Eighth, resolute struggle must be carried out against corruption and degeneration. The Northeast has launched a movement against corruption and degeneration, and has achieved great results. Corrupt and degenerate elements are open destroyers of state property, and they often cause huge economic losses to the state. This must not be tolerated and must be eliminated.

We should also make efforts to lead and promote the increase production and practice economy movement in other aspects. For agricultural production, the main thing is to increase the yield per unit area. This also includes saving the use of land in densely populated areas. As long as we conscientiously promote the advanced experience of Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, etc., we can create a lot of wealth for the country in agriculture. In cultural and educational work, we should advocate revolutionary methods, that is, using less manpower and material resources to exert a greater and greater role than now. At present, inappropriately emphasizing the "standardization" of school buildings, school equipment, and teacher allocation is the most harmful. Other cultural undertakings inappropriately pursuing material equipment too early will also greatly hinder the popularization movement and seriously weaken the combat effectiveness of cultural work, which should be opposed. In private industry and commerce and the general society, we should advocate saving unnecessary expenses to increase production funds, advocate a simple style, oppose flashy ideas; advocate savings, and oppose waste. Private industrialists should use all available funds to expand industrial production; private businesses should earnestly serve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Private industry and commerce should obtain reasonable profits, but must resolutely oppose profiteering.

Because "increasing production and practicing economy" is a general guideline and general task that runs through all aspects, we must universally and deeply launch a nationwide mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy. Without a vigorous mass movement, without resolutely relying on the masses, the call to increase production and practice economy will not have good results. However, to fully mobilize the masses, it is necessary to repeatedly carry out ideological mobilization work among the masses and thoroughly criticize various erroneous ideas among the masses.

Some people think that they have gone through "streamlining administration and reducing staff" and several "reorganizations", each time just saving some expenses. They do not deeply understand the great positive significance of Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy", and do not regard increasing production and practicing economy as the fundamental guideline and basic method for building the country in the future. People with this kind of thinking have a very shallow understanding of the past streamlining movement, and they have ignored the great significance of this great increase production and practice economy movement. This is a manifestation of political insensitivity. There is also a kind of "almost" thought. Some people say: Increasing production and practicing economy is very important, but there is not much "oil and water" here. They think that the Kuomintang's "mess" that they have taken over has been changed to what it is now, which is already very difficult. It is much better than the Kuomintang era and the Japanese era. There are not many problems in management. To squeeze out more "oil and water", unless another large factory is opened. This is a conservative view based on complacency. This view negates the unlimited potential power in our production cause. They do not understand that fully utilizing the existing various production conditions plays a decisive role in the country's construction work. The Northeast working class's achievement of increasing production and saving 10 million tons of grain and the achievements of Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli and other agricultural production are powerful answers to this conservative thought.

There are also some people who regard increasing production and practicing economy as a temporary task outside of production work. They only consider how to "make up" the tasks assigned to them. Most of the methods they use are to take some stagnant materials from their warehouses to "hand over the task". They do not consider mobilizing the entire production cause by means of increasing production and practicing economy. This is actually canceling the increase production and practice economy movement under the guise of "completing the task". Some people also support economy and oppose extravagance and waste, but they only pay attention to small wastes in life and daily work (such as reducing stationery, envelopes, etc.), and do not pay attention to the biggest problems in production (such as the use of funds, the utilization of equipment, etc.); they do not study business, are not familiar with production, and often cause huge losses as a result. It should be pointed out to them that attention should be paid to large and small projects in increasing production and practicing economy, but more attention should be paid to preventing large wastes. Some of them are actively engaged in increasing production and practicing economy, but the methods they use are not to consult with the masses, not to rely on the masses, but only to rely on a few technicians and accountants to calculate in the office. All the plans they have formulated without a mass base are empty and cannot be realized. Leading cadres should help them correct them. Finally, there are still some people who take a negative or even resistant attitude in the face of the increase production and practice economy movement. A few people even feel that it does not matter to be corrupt, and they feel that "people cannot be completely selfless." All of these are reflections of the corrupt and degenerate ideas of the landlords and bourgeoisie on the minds of our state workers. This kind of thinking is the enemy of our country and must be thoroughly eliminated.

In order to correct erroneous ideas and launch a mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, we must also mobilize the masses on the one hand, and extensively carry out criticism and self-criticism; fully expose all phenomena of waste and inefficiency, as well as phenomena of corruption and degeneration, and promote these personnel who have made mistakes to conduct self-criticism. On the whole, the staff of our governments at all levels and state-owned enterprises are unprecedentedly clean and efficient. The social atmosphere of New China is also advocating simplicity. We are correct, healthy, and upward. But locally speaking, we still have many shortcomings. Precisely because we are healthy, we need self-criticism and dare to carry out self-criticism. There should be no worries in this regard. On the other hand, we should do our best to promote and promote the advanced experience of increasing production and practicing economy. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, link with the actual situation of the enterprise and the agency, put forward methods for production and economy, and should make all advanced experience quickly spread throughout the country, and urge all regions to adopt it. This is a very important key. At present, promoting the advanced production and economy experience of factories and mines in the Northeast is of great significance to the whole country.

For the sake of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, for the construction of the motherland, in the glorious and great movement of increasing production and practicing economy, let our compatriots across the country act together to launch a broad, sustained, and enthusiastic mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call!

### 开展增产节约运动是国家当前的中心任务

　　开展增产节约运动是国家当前的中心任务
    在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，毛主席向我们提出并由会议一致通过了“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的任务。这是我们国家当前最重要的中心任务，全国人民正在积极行动起来为实现这一任务而奋斗。为了开展一个全国规模的增产节约运动，我们认为还必须把这个运动的目标和具体方针加以说明，使全国人民步调一致，来完成这个重大的任务。
    为了更进一步加强抗美援朝的力量，全国人民必须充分地支持前线，支持中国人民志愿军，在保持国内物价稳定和不过分加重人民负担的条件下，保证对前方的物资供应。这就只有努力增加生产、厉行节约。但是，更重要的，为了准备今后国家大规模的建设，积累各种建设所需要的资金，我们全国人民必须加倍努力增加生产、厉行节约。应该认识“增产节约”并不只是解决某种困难的临时手段，而是建设人民国家的根本方法。要使我们的国家工业化，必须有不断增加的大量资金。但是这些资金从何而来？在各帝国主义国家，它们为取得工业化的资金，大体上采取下述四种方法的一种或数种：（一）剥削国内人民，（二）劫掠殖民地，（三）强迫战败国赔款，（四）借外债。我们人民的国家，不应当采取前面三个方法，借外债也不能是一个主要的方法。因此人民国家工业化的资金，必须从农业、国营企业等生产中和财政预算的节省中逐渐积累。社会主义的苏联积累工业化资金的经验完全证明了这一点。因此，我国工业化资金的来源也必须从增产节约中去寻求，这是唯一正确的道路。
    我们国家企业中的管理人员、技术人员和工人群众，有一部分曾经受了资本主义思想的影响，有的在过去长期革命战争中习惯于供给制的生活和工作作风，这就使他们在企业的经营管理和生产方法上趋于浪费。我们必须纠正这种浪费，而实行经济核算的方法。在农业中，我们要使农民逐渐改变那种粗放的耕种方法，更广泛地组织起来，实行精耕细作，以提高单位面积的产量。在各级人民政府、人民解放军各部队、各级人民团体和中国共产党的各级组织中，我们要继续发扬勤俭朴素艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，向着一切铺张浪费和贪污行为作坚决的斗争。从这些方面努力开展一个广泛群众性的增产节约运动，对于我国的建设事业将会有极大的好处。
    国营企业和国家机关、合作社的增产节约，效果将是最大的。这些企业和机关的增产节约运动应该从以下几个方面立即开展起来：
    第一、我们所接收的官僚资产阶级和帝国主义的企业，由于过去腐败的经营，仓库中积压的设备和材料很多，我们接管之后，因经验不足，没有加以彻底清理，而且在某些地方还有些新的材料被积压，这在新解放区是更加严重的。北京石景山钢铁厂在核定资金以前，一个厂用了两个厂的资金；西安铁路局六月份库存材料比需要量几乎多了十倍；株州铁路工厂在十月份清查的结果，发现该厂占用了等于五个厂的资金。这些资财积压的现象必须立即纠正。
    第二、许多国营贸易机关和工厂、矿山，因为流动资金周转太慢，引起很大的浪费；加速流动资金的周转，就可以为国家节约很大数量的资金。据东北工业部所属厂矿一月至八月的统计，在完成原定国家计划之外，为国家增产节约的四百余万吨粮食中，加速流动资金周转所得占了百分之四十七点七。这是最明显的例子，各地都应该学习这个经验。
    第三、各地在基本建设投资中，还有不小的数目是浪费的。不经过正确的勘查设计而盲目施工所造成的损失，十分巨大；各处有许多不急之务，如大礼堂、体育馆、游泳池、大马路等工程，完全可以缓办；但由于财政监督不严，却任意举办起来。这种浪费现象今后不应该继续发生。
    第四、生产和工作的效率还应该大大提高一步。工业设备的利用率，首先应充分发挥起来。西北机械工业系统的设备利用率只达百分之二十九点三；全国电业设备的利用率目前平均只达百分之三十五；许多国营工厂的废品率还很大。这些情形都应该在增产节约运动中加以改变。
    第五、应该继续努力降低成本。这主要是要节省使用原料材料，减少管理费用。大的材料不应作小的用途，好的材料不应作坏的用途，以免增加成本。非生产所需的管理人员不应太多，不合理的劳动组织应即改变，这些也是降低成本的一个方法。
    第六、国家机关和企业组织的人员编制，目前还有很大的浪费。有些机关彼此重叠，而且一般是层次太多，有些机关编制太大。这样的机构，不仅浪费人力物力，而且严重地减弱了工作的效能。与此相联的，有些机关的预算庞大，超过了实际的需要。这也应该立即纠正。预算节余和粮食结余上缴的制度，应即认真建立起来。
    第七、一切铺张浪费的现象，如宴会、纪念会、招待会、专业会议等都必须尽力节省；纪念章、纪念册等不必滥发；不必要的送礼应即免除；汽车等使用也应严加限制；某些中级以上干部在生活上过于铺张的现象必须纠正。
    第八、对于贪污蜕化的行为，必须进行坚决的斗争。东北已开展了反贪污蜕化的运动，而且取得了很大的成效。贪污蜕化分子是国家财产的公开破坏者，他们往往使国家遭受巨大的经济损失。这是决不能容许的，一定要予以杜绝。
    对于其他方面的增产节约运动，我们同样应该努力加以领导和推动。对于农业生产方面，主要的是应该提高单位面积产量。这在人口稠密的地区来说，也包括对土地使用的节约在内。只要我们认真地把李顺达、曲耀离等的先进经验推广开来，就可以在农业方面为国家创造大量的财富。在文化教育工作方面，应该提倡革命的办法，即以较少的人力和物力，发挥比现在更大更多的作用。在目前，不适当地强调校舍、学校设备和教师配备等方面的“正规化”，是最有害的。其他文化事业不适当地过早地追求物质设备，也会大大地妨害普及运动，严重地减弱文化工作的战斗性，这是应该反对的。在私营工商业和一般社会方面，都应该倡导节约不必要的费用来增加生产的资金，提倡俭朴的风气，反对浮华的思想；提倡储蓄，反对浪费。私营工业家应把一切可用的资金都用到扩大工业生产上去；私营商业应切实地为城乡物资交流而服务。私营工商业应取得合理利润，但必须坚决反对暴利思想。
    因为“增产节约”是贯串到一切方面的总方针和总任务，因此，我们必须普遍地深入地发动一个全国规模的增产节约的群众运动。没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，不坚决依靠群众，增产节约的号召是不会有良好结果的。但是，要充分发动群众，就必需在群众中反复进行思想动员工作，彻底地批判群众中各种错误的思想。
    有些人以为自己经过了“精兵简政”和几次“整编”，每次都无非是节省一些费用而已。他们不深刻了解毛主席号召“增产节约”的重大的积极的意义，没有把增产节约作为今后建设国家的根本方针和基本方法来看待。有这种思想的人，对于过去的精简运动的了解是极不深刻的，他们更忽视了这一次伟大的增产节约运动的重大意义。这是政治上麻木不仁的表现。还有一种“差不多”的思想。有人说：增产节约很重要，不过我这里没有多少“油水”。他们以为，他们所接收下来的国民党的“烂摊子”，能改变到现在这种样子，已经很不容易了，比国民党时代和日本人时代已经好得多了，在经营管理上已没有多大的毛病了，要挤出更多的“油水”，除非另外开办大工厂。这是一种从自满情绪出发的保守观点。这种观点否定了我们生产事业中无限的潜在力量。他们不了解充分利用现有的各种生产条件在国家建设工作中是具有决定作用的。东北工人阶级增产节约一千万吨粮食和李顺达、曲耀离等农业生产上的成绩，就是对于这种保守思想的有力回答。
    还有一些人把增产节约作为生产工作以外的临时任务。他们只考虑如何把所分派的任务“凑”够就行。他们所用的方法，大半是把自己仓库中的呆滞材料拿一些来“交任务”，他们并不考虑用增产节约的方法，把整个生产事业动员起来。这实际上是在“完成任务”的外衣下，取消了增产节约运动。也有些人拥护节约，反对铺张浪费，但他们只注意了一些生活上和日常工作上的小的浪费（如减少信纸、信封等），对于生产上最大的问题（如资金使用、设备利用等）则不加注意；他们不钻研业务，不熟悉生产，往往因此造成巨大的损失。应该向他们指出，对于增产节约中的大小项目都应注意，但更应当注意防止大的浪费。他们之中有些是积极进行增产节约工作的，但他们所用的方法，不是和群众商量，不是依靠群众，而只是依靠少数技术人员和会计人员在办公室里算来算去。他们所拟订的没有群众基础的一切计划都是空的，不能实现。领导干部应该帮助他们纠正。最后，还有一些人在增产节约运动面前，采取消极甚至于抵抗的态度。有少数人甚至于觉得贪污一点也不要紧，他们觉得“人总不能完全不自私的”。所有这一些都是地主、资产阶级的腐化堕落思想在我们国家工作人员思想上的反映。这种思想是我们国家的敌人，必须加以彻底肃清。
    为要纠正错误思想、开展增产节约的群众运动，我们还必须在一方面发动群众，广泛地开展批评与自我批评；对于一切浪费和无效能的现象，以及贪污腐化的现象，进行充分的揭露，并推动这些犯错误的人员进行自我批评。从整个说来，我们的各级人民政府和国家企业的工作人员，都是空前廉洁和有效能的。新中国的社会风气，也是崇尚朴实的。我们是正确的、健康的、向上的。但是从局部说来，我们还有不少缺点。正因为我们是健康的，我们才需要自我批评而且敢于进行自我批评。在这一方面不应该有什么顾虑。在另一方面，我们应当以全力提倡和推广增产节约的先进经验。要充分发动群众，联系本企业、本机关的实际情况，提出生产节约的办法，并应使一切先进经验迅速地传遍全国，督促各地加以采用。这是一个极重要的关键。目前推广东北先进厂矿的增产节约经验，对全国就具有极大的意义。
    为了抗美援朝，为了祖国的建设，在光荣而伟大的增产节约运动中，让我们全国同胞一致行动起来吧，开展一个广泛的、持久的、热烈的增产节约的群众运动，为实现毛主席伟大的号召而斗争！
