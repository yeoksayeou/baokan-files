Beijing People's Court

Completes Trial of Wang Wenzhi's Murder of His Wife, etc.

Criminals to be Publicly Tried and Severely Punished

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In the movement to vigorously inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law, the Beijing People's Court accepted the cases of Wang Wenzhi's abuse and murder of his wife and Bai Xiuchen's killing of his adopted daughter. After thorough investigation, the court has now concluded the trial. In order to educate the broad masses of the people, a public trial is scheduled for the afternoon of the 26th of this month. The criminals will receive the most severe punishment under the law.

    Wang Wenzhi is 32 years old, a native of Beijing, residing at No. 51, Xiaojiaoting Village, Eastern Suburbs. This criminal has consistently abused his wife and raped women. Since 1942, he has successively raped and abducted ten women, including Wang Yonglan, Li Daling, and Lu Xiaomeizi. In 1941, Wang Wenzhi married Wang Liu. After the marriage, he beat and cursed Wang Liu, frequently abusing her. In the autumn of 1944, Wang Liu became pregnant and was near delivery. The criminal kicked her abdomen violently, and Wang Liu immediately lost consciousness and died the next day. In 1946, the criminal remarried, taking Gu Guangzhen as his wife, and continued to cruelly abuse her, often depriving her of food and even binding and beating her with hemp ropes, and burning her with hot pokers. In September 1949, Gu Guangzhen gave birth to a child, but due to lack of care and frequent abuse by the criminal, both she and the child died one after another. Wang Yonglan, who was raped by the criminal, became pregnant in 1949. The criminal abducted her to Zhangjiakou and constantly beat and scolded her, forbidding her from going out. The criminal returned to his native place with Wang Yonglan in January of this year, intending to register for marriage. Wang Yonglan and her mother, after experiencing the long-term barbaric persecution by Wang, realized that they would not be able to turn over unless they rose up and struggled, and therefore filed a complaint with the People's Court.

    Bai Xiuchen, male, 59 years old, a native of Beijing, residing at No. 38, West Third Alley. Bai Xiuchen often beat and scolded his adopted daughter, Cuiling. After the liberation of Beijing, he also prevented Cuiling from attending night school. Bai Cuiling, unable to bear Bai Xiuchen's abuse, wanted to sever the relationship between them as adopted father and daughter. On the afternoon of May 26, Cuiling and Bai Xiuchen went through the formalities for severing the relationship as adopted father and daughter. When Cuiling went to bid farewell to Guan Qichun, a neighbor in the courtyard, Bai Xiuchen secretly brought a weapon and rushed over, handing the written agreement to Cuiling. While Cuiling was looking down attentively at the agreement, he raised his knife and slashed dozens of times, also wounding two people who were present at the time. Shao Li, who was taking a nap in the courtyard, woke up and discovered the murder, shouting "Help!" Bai Xiuchen then smashed the doors and windows of Shao Li's house, dragged Shao Li out, and slashed wildly at her head. At this time, armed police officers from the police station arrived and arrested the murderer on the spot, and the police station sent all the injured to the hospital for emergency treatment. Bai Cuiling eventually died due to her serious injuries. (Zhan Jun, Si Zhi)
