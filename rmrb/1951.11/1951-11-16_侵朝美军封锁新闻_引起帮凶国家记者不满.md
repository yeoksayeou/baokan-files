　　U.S. Troops Invading Korea Block News
    Arousing Dissatisfaction Among Accomplice Countries' Journalists
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch] The American Eighth Army's news censor, who represents the U.S. invading army authorities in implementing the news blockade policy, has caused dissatisfaction among British journalists due to discrimination against them.

    According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 12th: The British "Daily Telegraph" published a lengthy dispatch on its front page on the 12th from its correspondent with the American Eighth Army in Korea, Downton. Downton expressed anger at the U.S. military news censor's "detention from Monday to Saturday" of a piece of news sent by British journalists. He said: The current censorship system is "stricter and more incomprehensible" than before, and "British, Australian, and Canadian journalists cannot help but feel that there is some degree of anti-British bias in it." Downton wrote: "A very disappointing thing is that it is now clearly necessary for the Commonwealth to send representatives to participate in the inspection work of the Eighth Army headquarters in Korea. The Commonwealth journalists here have lost confidence in the fairness of the existing American-run inspection system." According to a British War Office spokesperson: In addition to the "Daily Telegraph," another British news organization has also complained about this.

    The Associated Press stated: "The British War Office has ordered an investigation into the alleged anti-British bias of the American Eighth Army news censor in Korea."

　　侵朝美军封锁新闻
    引起帮凶国家记者不满
    【新华社十五日讯】代表美国侵略军当局执行新闻封锁政策的美国第八军新闻检查官对于英国记者的歧视，已引起英国记者的不满。
    据美联社伦敦十二日电透露：英国“每日电讯报”十二日在第一版上刊载了该报随朝鲜美国第八军记者唐顿发来的长篇电讯。唐顿对于美军新闻检查官把英国记者拍发的一条消息，“从星期一扣留到星期六”，表示愤怒。他说：现今的检查制度较以前“更严格、更令人莫测高深”，“英国、澳大利亚和加拿大的记者们不得不感觉到其中有某种程度的反英偏向”。唐顿写道：“一件大煞风景的事是：目前显然需要英联邦派遣代表参加朝鲜第八军总部的检查工作，此间联邦记者们对于现有的美国人包办的检查制度的………公平性，已经失去信心。”据英国陆军部发言人透露：对此发出怨言的，除了“每日电讯报”外，还有另外一个英国新闻机构。
    美联社称：“英国陆军部已下令调查传说中的朝鲜美国第八军新闻检查官的反英偏向。”
