    Support the Innocent Defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" with Actions to Eliminate More American Aggressors
    Editor: I have written a letter to Saito Chi, one of the innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," and I am sending it to you now, hoping that you can publish it at your discretion or forward it to Comrade Saito Chi himself. The letter is as follows: To the heroic Japanese peace fighter Comrade Saito Chi:
    I am a young man in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and we are fighting on the Korean front against American imperialist aggression and to defend world peace. When I saw your letter to the Chinese people in the newspapers of our motherland, I was very moved and excited. I seem to see your chest full of strength and your powerful arms shaking the iron bars.
    While you and other innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" are being persecuted, American imperialism is also brutally massacring the Korean people in Korea. American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese people. We Chinese people have already driven the aggressive forces of American imperialism out of the Chinese mainland, and today we are fighting it vigorously on the Korean battlefield together with our Korean brothers. The powerful force of the united people of the world will surely be able to completely defeat the American imperialists.
    After the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" begins, the American-Japanese reactionaries will certainly continue to persecute you in every possible way, but the truth can never be obliterated. All of us Chinese people are supporting you, and we Chinese People's Volunteers will use practical actions to eliminate more American aggressors to strike at the American imperialist forces that are persecuting you. Fight resolutely and courageously! One day, the people will smash the prisons of all reactionaries in the world, and the fighters for peace and freedom will surely win! Greetings!
    A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    以多消灭美国侵略军的行动支援“松川事件”无辜被告
    编辑同志：我写了一封给日本“松川事件”无辜被告之一斋藤千的信，现在寄给你们，希望能酌予发表，或转寄给斋藤千同志本人。信如下：英勇的日本和平斗士斋藤千同志：
    我是中国人民志愿军里的一个青年，我们正在朝鲜前线为反对美帝国主义的侵略与保卫世界和平而战斗着。当我在祖国的报纸上看到你给中国人民的信以后，我非常的感动与兴奋。我好像看到了你的充满力量的胸膛，与摇撼着铁窗的有力的手臂。
    当你与其他“松川事件”的无辜被告在遭受迫害的时候，美帝国主义也正在朝鲜残酷地屠杀朝鲜人民，美帝国主义是中国、朝鲜与日本人民最凶恶的敌人，我们中国人民已经把美帝国主义的侵略势力赶出了中国的大陆，今天并且正在与朝鲜兄弟一起在朝鲜战场上有力地打击着它。全世界人民团结起来的强大力量，一定能够彻底打败美帝国主义者。
    在“松川事件”的第二审开始以后，美日反动派一定会继续对你们横加迫害，但是真理是决不能被抹煞的，我们全中国人民都在支持你们，我们中国人民志愿军要用消灭更多的美国侵略者的实际行动，来打击迫害你们的美帝国主义势力。坚决英勇地斗争吧！终有一天，人民将会粉碎世界上所有反动派的牢狱，争取和平与自由的战士一定会获得胜利！敬礼！    中国人民志愿军某部    韩慕吾
