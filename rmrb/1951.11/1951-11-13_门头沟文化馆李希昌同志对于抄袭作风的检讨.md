Mentougou Cultural Center Comrade Li Xichang's Self-Criticism Regarding Plagiarism

Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 13th published Comrade Shen Qiao's letter criticizing my plagiarism. When I first saw the letter criticizing me, I tried to deny it. Later, after the People's Daily pointed out the facts, I began to realize that submitting one manuscript to multiple publications or plagiarism is an extremely bad and shameful practice.

I originally wanted to write an article for the newspaper with the theme "Three Great Happy Events in the Jingxi Mining Area," but because my writing level was low, after I saw the report written by Comrade Ma Ning in the "Trial Edition" of the Beijing Evening News on August 18th, I copied four copies and sent them to the People's Daily, Xinmin Daily, Guangming Daily, and Worker's Daily. When submitting the manuscript, it was originally August 18th, but in order to deceive the newspaper editors and prevent them from seeing that it was plagiarism, I changed it to the 14th. Why did I take this shameful approach? Mainly to swindle稿费 (稿费, gǎo fèi is a payment or remuneration made to an author, writer, or contributor for their work, particularly for articles, essays, stories, or other written content published in newspapers, magazines, journals, or other publications) and show off. This is an extremely bad practice. In the future, in addition to resolutely overcoming the practice of submitting one manuscript to multiple publications and plagiarism in my writing, I also hope that local correspondents will not make the same mistake as me.

    门头沟文化馆李希昌同志对于抄袭作风的检讨
    编辑同志：九月十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了申乔同志批评我抄袭行为的信，在初看到批评我的信时，我还企图抵赖，后经人民日报据实指出，这才使我初步认识了一稿数投或抄袭是一种极恶劣的可耻的作风。
    我原来也想用“京西矿区有三大喜事”这一主题给报纸写稿，但因我的写作水平低，所以我在八月十八日看到十五日的北京晚报“试版”所载马宁同志所写的这篇报道后，就照抄了四份，分寄给人民日报、新民报、光明日报、工人日报。寄稿时，本是八月十八日，但为了欺骗报社编辑，使其看不出是抄袭，我就改为十四日。为什么我要采取这种可耻的办法呢？主要是为了骗取稿费和出风头。这是一种极恶劣的作风。今后我除在写作中坚决克服这种一稿数投和抄袭的作风外，并希望各地通讯员不要犯我这样的错误。
