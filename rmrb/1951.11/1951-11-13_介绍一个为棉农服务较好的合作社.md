　　Introducing a Cooperative That Serves Cotton Farmers Well
　　Editor: The cadres of the Longwang Li Village Joint Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Dongguang County, Shandong Province (including nine nearby natural villages) have helped cotton farmers solve many difficulties and are supported by the masses. These nine villages cultivated a total of 10,536 mu of cotton this year. This spring, in order to solve the problem of insufficient high-quality cotton seeds, the cooperative prepared more than 5,000 jin of high-quality Wuaiai cotton seeds long ago and supplied them to members in a timely and inexpensive manner, so that cotton farmers could happily and timely plant cotton. This spring, the germination rate of cotton seeds was over 80%. The cotton farmers, looking at the green and thriving cotton seedlings, praised: "The cooperative's cotton seeds are different from others." However, just as the autumn harvest was in sight, the cotton plants were infested with cotton aphids, and the cotton farmers were very anxious. The cooperative's cadres were busy going to Jinan and Tianjin to purchase insecticide raw materials. After buying them back, they worked day and night to prepare them, selling a total of over 13 million yuan worth of insecticides and sprayers, helping cotton farmers overcome the insect disaster. This year, the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the local cotton fields is 120 to 130 jin, an increase of 20 to 30 jin per mu compared to last year. In order to ensure the completion of the cotton purchase task, the cooperative, in addition to the store purchase, also organized a mobile cotton purchase team to regularly collect cotton in various villages. This saves cotton farmers' time, avoids congestion within the cooperative, and also increases the amount of purchase. Previously, the store only purchased 5,000 to 6,000 jin per day, but now it can purchase 12,000 to 13,000 jin per day just by purchasing in the countryside. The cooperative cadres also combined cotton collection with propaganda work, encouraging the patriotic cotton sales enthusiasm of members and cotton farmers. According to statistics, the cooperative collected and stored 350,000 jin of cotton in September.
　　In order to meet the cotton farmers' needs in life, the cooperative combined cotton purchases with the supply of more than 30 million yuan worth of grain, cloth, and other daily necessities. However, this still cannot meet the new requirements of the members. The cooperative plans to: 1. Organize brick and tile kilns to help the masses build houses; provide leadership and support for handicraft production, and place orders with the agricultural tool manufacturing industry; 2. Vigorously develop commodity retail business in a planned manner; 3. Develop cultural and welfare undertakings for members, such as purchasing radios; 4. In addition to expanding the organization and increasing share capital, vigorously develop deposit and loan business to overcome the difficulty of insufficient cooperative funds.

　　介绍一个为棉农服务较好的合作社
    编辑同志：山东东光县龙王李村联村供销合作社
    （包括附近九个自然村）的全体干部，帮助棉农解决了许多困难，受到群众拥护。这九个村今年共植棉一万零五百三十六亩；今春合作社为了解决优良棉种不足的问题，早就准备了优良的五爱棉种五千多斤，及时廉价供应社员，使棉农都能愉快而适时地把棉花种上。今春棉种发芽率在百分之八十以上，棉农们看着绿色茁壮的棉苗，都称赞说：合作社的棉种与众不同。但正值秋收在望之际，棉花生了棉蚜，棉农们都很焦急。合作社的干部就忙着去济南、天津购买杀虫药原料，买回后又不分昼夜地配制，计售出杀虫药和喷雾器的总值共达一千三百余万元，帮助棉农战胜了虫灾。今年当地棉田，平均每亩产籽棉一百二、三十斤，较去年每亩还增产二、三十斤。为了保证完成购棉任务，合作社除了门市收购外，又组织一个流动收棉组，定期到各村收棉。这样既节省了棉农时间，又避免了社内拥挤，同时也增加了收购量。以前门市每天只收五、六千斤，现在只下乡收购每天即可收一万二、三千斤。合作社干部还结合收棉进行宣传工作，鼓舞了社员、棉农的爱国售棉热情，据统计：该社九月份就收储棉花三十五万斤。
    为了满足棉农生活上的需要，合作社结合收购棉花，供应了价值三千多万元的粮食、布匹和其他日用品。但这还不能满足社员新的要求。该社今后还准备：一、组织砖瓦窑业，扶助群众建筑房屋；对手工业生产加以领导和扶植，向制造农具的行业订货；二、有计划地大力开展商品零售业务；三、开展社员的文化福利事业，如购买收音机等；四、除扩大组织增加股金外，并大力开展存、贷业务，以克服合作社资金不足的困难。
