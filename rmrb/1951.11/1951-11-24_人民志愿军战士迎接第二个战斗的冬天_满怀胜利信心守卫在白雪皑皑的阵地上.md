(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 23rd) Our front-line reporter reports: Heavy snow fell on the Korean front on the 22nd. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, warmly dressed in winter clothing, are guarding the snow-covered positions. They are full of confidence in victory, greeting the second winter of fighting.

As soon as the rainy season ended, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army began preparing for the winter. By the end of October, all the preparations were basically completed. All units universally built heated brick beds (kangs), and stored sufficient grain, vegetables, ammunition, as well as firewood, charcoal, and hay. One unit, in fourteen days, cut 4,330,982 jin of horse grass and built 894 kang beds. Another unit, in twenty days, built 1,164 winter shelters, prepared 114,069 jin of dried vegetables, and chopped 615,050 jin of firewood.

The winter shelters of the Volunteer Army units are sturdy and clean, providing protection against air raids, artillery fire, fire, cold, and dampness. Most shelters have kang beds. The kang beds are covered with hay. Some even built fireplaces on the walls of the shelters. Many units also built classrooms, drill grounds, bathhouses, and clubs around the shelters. During lulls in the fighting, the soldiers rest in their shelters, attend classes, read books and newspapers in the classrooms. The clubs are often crowded with people playing chess and cards. In the sturdy and spacious warehouses, grain and ammunition are piled high.

    满怀胜利信心守卫在白雪皑皑的阵地上
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜前线二十二日普降大雪。中国人民志愿军的战士们都身着温暖的冬装，守卫在白雪皑皑的阵地上。他们满怀着胜利信心，迎接着第二个战斗的冬天。
    雨季刚一结束时，中国人民志愿军的指挥员战斗员们便开始了过冬的准备工作。到十月底，所有的准备工作都基本上做好了。各部队普遍地砌起了火炕，贮藏了充足的粮食、菜蔬、弹药以及木柴、木炭、干草等物。某部在十四天内，就割了四百三十三万零九百八十二斤马草，砌了八百九十四个炕铺。另部在二十天内修筑了一千一百六十四所冬季掩蔽部，准备了十一万四千零六十九斤干菜，并砍了六十一万五千零五十斤木柴。
    志愿军各部的冬季掩蔽部都坚固而整洁，可以防空、防炮、防火、防寒和防潮。大部分掩蔽部里修有炕铺。炕铺上铺着干草。有的还在掩蔽部的墙壁上砌了壁炉。更有许多部队在掩蔽部的周围建筑了课堂、操场、浴室和俱乐部。在战斗空隙里，战士们便在自己的掩蔽部里休息，在课堂里上课、看书和读报。而在俱乐部里，经常挤满着下棋和打扑克的人。在坚固而又宽大的仓库里，则满堆着粮食和弹药。
