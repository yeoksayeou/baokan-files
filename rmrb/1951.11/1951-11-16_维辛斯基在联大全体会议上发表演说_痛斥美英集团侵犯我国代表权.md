Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 14th: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly plenary session on the afternoon of the 13th regarding the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations. He vehemently denounced the US-UK group's despicable collusion to coerce the Assembly into passing a proposal refusing to discuss the issue, and firmly advocated for the immediate consideration of the issue of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

The UN General Committee had recommended that the Assembly decide not to consider any proposals during this session regarding the participation of representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in the Assembly, as well as the expulsion of representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang group. Vyshinsky pointed out that this suggestion is absolutely abnormal, absolutely inconceivable, and most absurd. Anyone who respects the UN General Assembly cannot agree to such a suggestion. The Assembly has its own authority on the issue of Chinese representation, and it cannot bind itself in advance, nor can it determine in advance that it must be in such a shameful position. The Soviet delegation lodges a solemn protest against the unprecedented situation caused by the infringement of the real rights of the great Chinese people.

Vyshinsky said: After overthrowing the corrupt Kuomintang regime, the Chinese people established the People's Republic of China in October 1949, and established their own people's government—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. This government represents nearly 500 million people and enjoys the complete trust and love of all the Chinese people. Thus, for the first time in their history, the Chinese people have obtained the sovereignty to decide their own destiny. Any attempt to infringe on this sovereignty of the Chinese people and prevent them from exercising this sovereignty by using the kind of decision that the General Committee is now forcing the Assembly to accept is a violation of the principles of international law and the UN Charter. The UN Charter directly stipulates that interference in the internal affairs of other countries is not permitted.

Vyshinsky then pointed out that until today, there are still Chiang Kai-shek's "representatives" in the United Nations. They cannot represent others, but can only represent a small group of reactionaries who have been driven out by the Chinese people and are continuing to engage in criminal activities against the Chinese people in Taiwan under the protection of American cannons. Everyone will surely consider this matter shameful.

The representatives of the US-UK group, having obstructed the discussion on China's representation in the United Nations at the Fifth General Assembly, are now doing their utmost to prevent the Sixth General Assembly from studying this issue. They want to use another shameful resolution to cover up the completely unacceptable act of infringing on the sovereignty of the great Chinese people. They are afraid of further exposing their aggressive policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, so they want to use deceptive tactics to induce the Assembly to pass this illegal and unconstitutional proposal.

Vyshinsky said: The Soviet delegation firmly opposes this behavior. The Soviet delegation believes that as long as the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, are not in the United Nations, the Assembly and other UN agencies will not be able to function normally for even a day. On the contrary, if the issue of Chinese representation is resolved immediately and satisfactorily, it will greatly contribute to easing the existing tension, maintaining international peace, and consolidating the United Nations. Therefore, the Soviet delegation requests the Assembly to reject the General Committee's proposal, which violates the Assembly's basic principles, violates the Charter, violates the interests of peace, and grossly insults the great Chinese people.

(Applause)

　　维辛斯基在联大全体会议上发表演说
    痛斥美英集团侵犯我国代表权
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十三日下午在联合国大会全体会议上就中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题发表演说，痛斥美英集团企图胁迫大会通过拒绝讨论这个问题的提案的可耻勾当，并坚决主张立即审议中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位的问题。
    联合国总务委员会曾建议大会决定在本届会议期间不审议让中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加大会以及驱逐中国的国民党集团代表的任何建议。维辛斯基指出：这个建议是绝对反常的，绝对不可思议的，最荒诞离奇的。凡是尊重联合国大会的人，决不能同意这种建议。大会在中国的代表权问题上有它自己的权力，它不能事先就把自己束缚起来，不能事先就确定非处于这种可耻的地位不可。苏联代表团对于因侵犯伟大的中国人民的真正权利而造成的史无前例的情况，提出严正的抗议。
    维辛斯基说：中国人民在推翻了腐朽的国民党政权以后，在一九四九年十月成立了中华人民共和国，建立了他们自己的人民政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府，这个政府代表将近五亿人民，它享有全体中国人民的完全信任与敬爱。这样，中国人民在他们的历史上第一次获得了自己决定自己的命运的主权。想用总务委员会现在强要大会接受的那种决定来侵犯中国人民的这种主权和阻止他们行使这个主权的任何企图，都是违反国际法的原则与联合国宪章的，联合国宪章直截了当地规定：不许干涉他国内政。
    维辛斯基接着指出：直到今天，联合国里面仍然有蒋介石的“代表”，他们不能代表别人，而只能代表已被中国人民赶出去、靠美国大炮的保护而躲在台湾继续挣扎进行反对中国人民的罪恶活动的一小撮反动派。这件事情谁都一定会认为是可耻的。
    美英集团的代表们既已在第五届大会上阻挠了关于中国在联合国的代表权的讨论，现在又竭力阻止第六届大会研究这个问题，他们是想用又一个可耻的决议案来掩饰完全不能容许的侵犯伟大中国人民的主权的行为。他们害怕进一步暴露他们敌视中华人民共和国的侵略政策，因此想用蒙骗手法来促使大会通过这种非法的违反宪章的提议。
    维辛斯基说：苏联代表团坚决反对这种行为。苏联代表团认为，只要联合国里一天没有人口占全世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国的合法代表，大会和联合国其他机构就一天不能正常地进行工作。反之，如果立即圆满地解决中国代表权问题，那就会大大有利于缓和现存的紧张局势、维护国际和平和巩固联合国。因此，苏联代表团要求大会否决总务委员会的违反大会基本原则、违反宪章、违反和平利益、而且粗暴地侮辱伟大中国人民的提议。
    （鼓掌）
