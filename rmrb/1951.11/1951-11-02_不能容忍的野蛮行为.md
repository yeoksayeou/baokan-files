Brief Comments on Political and Legal Work

　　Intolerable Barbarity

　　The brutal crime of Fu Jiacheng, a soldier-deserter in Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, who gouged out his wife's eyes, is intolerable to anyone with a shred of humanity. The liberated people of our country must not sit idly by and ignore this medieval act of barbarity against women. Our sisters are still suffering such profound pain, and we have a full responsibility to lead them onto the path of struggle, to persist in fighting for their own liberation, to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the evil feudal system from our people's democratic country, and to enable every woman to live an equal, democratic, free, and happy life.

　　Looking at the specific circumstances of this incident, the responsible cadres of the local people's government, people's organizations, and Party organizations should all recognize the weaknesses in their work and learn a profound lesson from this. Since Fu Jiacheng was so overbearing as to dare to openly tear down the flag of the Democratic Women's Federation and even dare to beat Zhu Jinmei until her nose bled, the Democratic Women's Federation of that village should have taken a firm stance. Why were the members of the Democratic Women's Federation scolded "away" by Fu Jiacheng! The Party branch, government, and other revolutionary organizations and cadres in the village could not have been unaware of Fu Jiacheng's illegal actions since their marriage, such as "not allowing Zhu Jinmei to go out freely or talk to the neighboring women," arbitrarily depriving her of human rights, and even threatening to "gouge out her eyes"; however, they did not take any effective measures to intervene and stop him. This allowed the perpetrator to become increasingly unrestrained and emboldened, resulting in a shocking tragedy.

　　In order to eradicate such incidents, in addition to conducting in-depth education on the Marriage Law for all cadres and the masses, making it a household name, and thoroughly changing people's wrong attitudes towards women, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the combat effectiveness of grass-roots governments and people's organizations, especially women's organizations, so that all grass-roots cadres understand the nature of our country, the nature of the organizations they lead, and recognize that they have a responsibility to fight for the implementation of the Marriage Law and a responsibility to protect women's lives and other democratic rights. The State Council of the Central People's Government stated in the "Instructions on Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law": "In the future, if any woman is killed or commits suicide due to marriage problems and is not given the rights and protections granted by the Marriage Law, the main cadres at the district, township (village), and street levels shall bear certain responsibilities." This should make all cadres at the district, township (village), and street levels fully understand that all acts that infringe upon women's rights and interests must be promptly and resolutely intervened and stopped.

### 不能容忍的野蛮行为

　  不能容忍的野蛮行为
    浙江省乐清县兵痞傅家成挖掉妻子双眼的残暴罪行，对于稍为有点人性的人都是不能容忍的。解放了的我国人民决不能坐视这种中世纪的对妇女的野蛮暴行而不过问。我们的同胞姐妹还遭受着这样深重的痛苦，我们完全有责任把她们引到战斗的道路上来，为她们自身的解放而坚持斗争，使万恶的封建制度的残余从我们人民民主的国家彻底肃清，使每个妇女都能过平等的、民主的、自由幸福的生活。
    从这一事件发生的具体情形来看，当地人民政府、人民团体和党组织的负责干部都应该发现自己工作上的弱点，从此接受一个沉痛的经验教训。傅家成既然蛮横到敢于公开撕掉民主妇女联合会的旗子，甚至敢于用铁锤打得诸金妹鼻血直流，该村的民主妇女联合会就应该采取坚决的态度，为什么民主妇女联合会的会员们竟被傅家成骂“散”了呢！该村的党支部、政权和其他革命组织与干部，对于傅家成结婚以来“不准诸金妹自由外出，也不准同邻家妇女讲话”的任意剥夺人权的非法行为，以至“挖眼睛”的威胁，不能毫无所闻；但是，他们没有采取任何有效的措施予以干涉和制止。这就使作恶者越来越放肆，越胆大，以致造成了骇人听闻的惨案。
    为了根绝此类事件，除了应该向所有干部、群众深入进行婚姻法的教育，做到家喻户晓，彻底改变人们对妇女的错误态度之外，必须大力加强基层政权与人民团体尤其是妇女团体的战斗性，使所有基层干部认识我们国家的性质，认识自己所领导的团体的性质，认识自己有责任为贯彻执行婚姻法而斗争，有责任保障妇女的生命和其他民主权利。中央人民政府政务院在“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”中说：“今后如有妇女因婚姻问题得不到婚姻法所赋予的权利与保护而被杀或自杀者，区、乡（村）街级的主要干部，首先应负一定责任。”这应该使所有区、乡（村）街的干部们完全了解，对于侵犯妇女权益的一切行为，必须及时地坚决地加以干涉和制止。
