Xinhua News Agency, 1st: Before leaving Beijing to return to his country, Jerzy Putrament, the leader of the Polish People's Observation Delegation, made a farewell speech to the Chinese people. Jerzy Putrament said:

    Our month in China has been a month of profound experience. Thanks to the enthusiasm of our Chinese hosts, we were able to see a lot in this short period. We got to know Chinese farmers and workers, writers and soldiers. We met with Chinese youth and children. We were honored to meet and speak with Comrades Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, the leaders of People's China. We were very fortunate to be able to see Comrade Mao Zedong, the great teacher and leader of China.

    We are about to return to our country with the impressions these encounters have given us, with the impressions of what we have seen and heard in China. Now, I would like to tell my Chinese friends some of the things that impressed me the most.

    First of all, the jubilant scene of the Chinese people appears before my eyes. In Beijing, in the villages of Zhejiang Province, in Shanghai, and in Tianjin, wherever we went, we felt with every step that those who welcomed me were sincerely happy and jubilant. If someone thought of counting the number of smiling faces, then today's China, Mao Zedong's China, like the Soviet Union, would be in first place. How many times have I heard groups of students, soldiers, boys and girls, and even occasional passers-by sing to their heart's content; how many times have I met people humming songs softly and happily; if I were to make a movie or write a book about China, I would call it "Jubilant China."

    It is not difficult for us to find the reasons why the Chinese people are so jubilant, although this by no means means that they do not have arduous tasks to be solved. The happiness of the people, especially the happiness of the people, does not lie in being content with achievements after everything that must be achieved has been achieved. Happiness lies in knowing that they have chosen the right path and in knowing that they are moving along this path. The great Chinese people, living on a vast, beautiful, and rich land, with a great culture, excellent traditions, and abundant treasures needed for development, have suffered increasingly severe poverty and have been bullied by domestic and foreign exploiters in the past century due to the harm of domestic feudal landlords and the shameful policy of national betrayal, and due to the atrocities and deception of foreign imperialism.

    The Chinese people have been liberated, they have confidence in their own strength, they clearly know their development prospects, they feel that every day reveals new and better possibilities for every honest person—all of this will stir up a great wave of jubilation among the entire people, and anyone who visits China today will be attracted by this wave.

    This jubilant situation merges with many other characteristics of today's People's China society, with many characteristics that appear before my eyes. The upsurge of patriotism, political awareness, humility, and the ability to sacrifice oneself for a great cause—the workers and farmers, intellectuals, and especially the youth we met all possess these qualities.

    The most pleasant time I experienced in China was the chance encounter with some eight- to ten-year-old elementary school students in Hangzhou. Once, we and our comrades were not with an interpreter. A group of children surrounded us. Everyone quickly found a common language: we began to sing "Mao Zedong, Stalin..." together. Later, we began to walk down the steps of an ancient pagoda. Each of us held the hands of some children. Their eyes showed such selfless and sincere friendship that I had rarely seen in the past, that is the brotherhood of all peoples, that is internationalism, and I cannot find a better explanation.

    We are about to return to our country, and our hearts are full of courage. Because China today is not only a jubilant country. China is also a strong, orderly, and determined country that strives for peace and has achieved victory. We have been convinced of this during our stay here.

    The scale and results of the political education received by the Chinese people surprised and delighted us.

    We believe that the vast masses of this country know the main tasks put forward by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for China. They not only know these tasks, approve of these tasks, but are also determined to fight to accomplish these tasks. The achievements of the Soviet Union tell us how great the power of a people with clear goals is. China's participation in the peace camp, bringing the will and determination of 500 million people into the peace camp, has been two years. This force can never be destroyed by the mercenaries and servants of U.S. imperialism.

    We are about to return to our country and tell our people what we have seen and heard in People's China. If we can correctly convey the actual situation in China, and can tell the spirit of self-sacrifice, the enthusiasm, and the determination to fight for peace that exists throughout China today, then our trip will have been a great success. Because China today brings courage to the whole world. China's jubilation is the jubilation of all honest people in the world. To speak correctly and convincingly about the situation in China today is to inspire all peoples with confidence in the victory of the peace camp, to give them strength and the will to fight, and to educate them. It also means breaking the dreams of the running dogs of U.S. imperialism who want to establish an "American century" on the earth.

    This will be another contribution of People's China to peace.

    We are about to leave China with full confidence in the future, in life, and in mankind. Thank you.

### 中国争取和平的斗争给世界人民带来勇气  波兰人民观礼代表团团长普特拉曼特向我国人民告别

    中国争取和平的斗争给世界人民带来勇气
    波兰人民观礼代表团团长普特拉曼特向我国人民告别
    【新华社一日讯】波兰人民观礼代表团团长耶齐·普特拉曼特在离京返国前夕发表向中国人民告别的谈话。耶齐·普特拉曼特说：
    我们在中国逗留的一个月，是我们获得深刻阅历的一个月。由于中国主人们的热诚，我们能在这短短的期间中看到了很多。我们认识了中国的农民和工人、作家和战士。我们和中国的青年儿童见了面。我们很荣幸能够会晤了人民中国的领袖朱德同志和周恩来同志，而且和他们谈了话。我们很幸运地能够看到了中国的伟大导师和领袖毛泽东同志。
    带着这些次相会给我们的印象，带着在中国所见所闻给我们的印象，我们即将返回祖国。现在，我愿意把我印象最深的一些事情告诉中国朋友。
    首先，我的眼前就浮现出中国人民欢欣鼓舞的情形。在北京、在浙江省的乡村中、在上海、在天津，不论我们走到哪里，我们每走一步都感觉到，欢迎我的人是衷心愉快，欢欣鼓舞。如果有人想到统计一下面带笑容的人的数目，那么今天的中国、毛泽东的中国，与苏联一样，都是占第一位的。多少次，我听到成群结队的学生、战士、男孩女孩，甚至是偶然同路的人纵情地歌唱；多少次，我遇见了轻松愉快地低声哼着歌曲的人们；如果我要摄制电影或者写作关于中国的书籍，我就把它叫“欢欣鼓舞的中国”。
    我们不难找出中国人民为什么这样欢欣鼓舞的原因，虽然这决不是说他们面前没有需要解决的艰巨任务。人们的幸福、特别是人民的幸福，并不在于必须达到的一切，都已经达到了而安于成就。幸福在于知道他们选择了正确的道路，而且知道是沿着这条道路前进。伟大的中国人民，生活在广阔、美丽和富饶的土地上，具有伟大的文化、优良的传统，拥有发展所需的丰富宝藏，可是由于本国封建地主的为害和可耻的卖国政策，由于外国帝国主义的暴行和欺骗，在近百年来却遭受了越来越深重的贫困，受到本国外国剥削者的欺凌。
    中国人民获得了解放、他们对自己的力量具有的信心、他们明确地知道自己的发展前途、他们感觉到每一天都给每一个正直的人揭开日新又新、越来越美好的可能性——所有这一切都会鼓起全体人民欢欣愉快的大浪潮，今天到中国访问的任何人都会为这种浪潮所吸引。
    这种欢欣鼓舞的情形与今天人民中国社会的其他许多特征、与许多浮现在我眼前的特征汇合起来。爱国主义的高涨、政治觉悟、谦虚的态度、为了伟大事业而自我牺牲的能力——我们所会见的工人以及农民、知识分子、特别是青年都具有这些品质。
    我在中国所经历的最愉快的时候，便是在杭州和一些八岁到十岁的小学生的偶遇。有一次，我们和同志们没有同翻译员在一起。一群孩子把我们围住了。大家很快就找到了共同的语言：我们同他们开始唱起“毛泽东，斯大林……”。随后，我们开始从一个古老的宝塔的台阶走下来。我们每人手中都牵着一些孩子的手。他们的眼中现出那么无私而热诚的友谊，那是我过去很少看到的，那就是各族人民的兄弟之情，那就是国际主义，我找不到更好的说明了。
    我们即将回国，我们的心中勇气充沛。因为中国今天不仅是欢欣鼓舞的国家。中国也是强而有力的、秩序井然的、坚决争取和平而且获得了胜利的国家。我们在此逗留的期间相信了这些。
    中国人民所受政治教育的规模和成果，使我们又惊奇又高兴。
    我们相信，这个国家的广大群众都知道共产党和毛主席对中国所提出的主要任务。他们不仅知道这些任务，赞成这些任务，并且还决心为完成这些任务而奋斗。苏联的成就告诉我们，有明确奋斗目标的人民是多么伟大的力量。中国参加和平阵营，把五亿人民的意志和决心带进了和平阵营已经两年了。这个力量决不是美帝国主义的雇佣兵和仆从们所能摧毁的。
    我们即将返回祖国，把我们在人民中国的见闻告诉我们人民。如果我们能够正确的传达出中国的实际情形，能够讲出那种自我牺牲的精神、那种热情和现在全中国的为和平而斗争的决心，那么我们此行就有了很好的成绩。因为中国今天给全世界带来了勇气。中国欢欣鼓舞的事就是世界上全体正直人们的欢欣鼓舞的事。正确而令人信服地讲出今天的中国的情形，就是用对和平阵营胜利的信心来鼓舞各族人民，给他们以力量和斗争的意志，并教育他们。这也意味着打破美帝国主义走狗们想在地球上建立“美国世纪”的迷梦。
    这将是人民中国对和平的又一贡献。
    我们满怀着对将来、对生活和对人类的信心，即将离开中国了。谢谢你们。
