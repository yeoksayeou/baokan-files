    Just as the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Safeguard the Home and Defend the Nation is unfolding vigorously across the country and has achieved brilliant victories, we are delighted to learn that our People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, after traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, enduring the wind and snow of the plateau, and overcoming numerous difficulties, have victoriously arrived at the strategically important border region in the southwest, crushing the imperialist plot of aggression. This great march is the result of reaching an agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and obtaining the active assistance of the Tibetan local government and all monks and laypeople under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. On the occasion of the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, we extend to you our cordial greetings and respect! We hope that you will unite closely, work hard in production, overcome all difficulties, continue to implement the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government, and work with the Tibetan local government to build a new Tibet, consolidate national defense, and continue to strive for the thorough implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
