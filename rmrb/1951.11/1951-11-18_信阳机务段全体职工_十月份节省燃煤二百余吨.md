    After the implementation of the rational, scientific new wage system in October this year, all employees of the Xinyang Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration have been swept up in a surge to increase production and save raw materials. According to precise statistics for October, the depot saved over 226 tons of coal for the nation with eleven locomotives, equivalent to over 43 million yuan (old currency). In August and September combined, only 162 tons of coal were saved. In comparison, the savings in October alone exceeded the savings in August and September by 39.5%. Now all employees of the depot have expressed their determination to continue to work hard to study technology, create more wealth, and dedicate it to the great motherland.
