    The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee's Experience in Leading the Autumn Patriotic Production Increase Movement

    In June of this year, many Party leading organs and cadres in Shanxi Province opposed the task of political struggle to doing a good job in agricultural production, preparing to abandon leadership over agricultural production and focus solely on leading political struggles. For example, the CCP Yuci County Committee believed: "Failure to carry out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a stumbling block for a thousand years. As for production, if it's delayed this year, we can do it next year." Especially since Shanxi Province launched a large-scale movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses generally increased, and many cadres made the mistake of thinking: "If politics are done well, production will naturally improve." "Production doesn't need leadership; the masses can do it themselves." Under the support of this one-sided thinking, agricultural production in many areas of the province once fell into a state of drift.

    In order to guarantee the realization of the patriotic production increase plan, the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, in response to the erroneous thinking of the cadres, promptly adopted the following measures:

    1.  Launched an ideological struggle against the idea of neglecting leadership over agricultural production both inside and outside the Party. To this end, it published an article in the Shanxi Daily reiterating the CCP Central Committee's instruction that "during the agricultural production season, accurately grasp agricultural production as the overriding central task in rural work," strictly criticizing the erroneous view of "production drifting;" and clarifying the principle that production work must be closely integrated with political work.

    2.  In order to implement the instructions of the CCP Central Committee, the province transferred more than 2,100 cadres above the county level, organized a strong agricultural production inspection team, led by responsible cadres at all levels, to go deep into districts and villages for inspection, and to help with local work.

    3.  Convened Party representative meetings, people's representative meetings, propaganda officer representative meetings, and various representative meetings of mutual aid teams (including mutual aid team leaders, labor models, and technical experts), youth, women, and militia, taking the county and district as the basic unit. At these meetings, production work was generally inspected, mobilized, and deployed. More than 100,000 representatives participated in the above meetings throughout the province. This force played a decisive role in reversing the phenomenon of drifting production leadership.

    4.  After the representatives of the above meetings returned to their villages, they actively carried out activities among the masses: on the one hand, continuing to carry out patriotic political education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; on the other hand, leading the broad masses of peasants to launch a movement to inspect and revise patriotic pledges, using patriotic pledges as a powerful weapon to promote the patriotic production increase competition.

    Due to the adoption of the above measures, a high tide of patriotic production increase competition was quickly set off throughout the province. 2,500 agricultural mutual aid teams throughout the province challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid team, and 150,000 agricultural mutual aid teams launched patriotic production increase competitions with each other, exceeding the scale of the summer competition, and ensuring the realization of this year's production increase competition plan. Throughout the province, 37 million mu of grain fields were hoed one more time than in previous years, and most of the more than 10 million mu of corn and sorghum were top-dressed with fertilizer. In order to eliminate the spreading cotton aphid disaster, more than 1.2 million peasant masses were involved in the cotton aphid eradication movement, completely eliminating cotton aphids on more than 3 million mu of cultivated land. This made the masses believe in the power of science and technology, in the power of organization, and in the principle that production must be led. In order to prevent floods and protect seedlings, all areas paid attention to digging channels, raising embankments, and doing a good job in sluice gates and weirs. During the flood season, more than 40 important flood control projects were completed, more than 78,000 water storage pits were dug, more than 22,600 drainage ditches were constructed, and 1.7 million trees were planted for flood control afforestation along rivers, greatly reducing the possibility of rain and flood disasters, and this year's water damage has been significantly reduced compared to last year.

    Because all areas generally paid attention to patriotic political propaganda in the patriotic production increase movement, most mutual aid teams have formulated patriotic pledges and established reading groups. Through political propaganda, the peasants' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance has been significantly improved. Their enthusiasm for planting various economic crops (such as cotton, tobacco, hemp, etc.) has increased; and they have paid more attention to increasing the yield per unit area of economic crops. At present, the autumn harvest has ended, and except for disaster-stricken areas, the production increase plan has generally been completed or overfulfilled. Some farmers have created examples of increasing yield per unit area. For example, Qu Yaoli's irrigated cotton yielded 920 jin of seed cotton per mu; Wen Guosi's irrigated wheat yielded 715 jin per mu; Zhao Dekuan's dryland corn yielded 930 jin per mu; and Shao Shuanghe's millet averaged 845 jin per mu.

    According to this period of movement, in order to organize scattered agricultural producers and carry out large-scale production movements, in addition to improving the political and ideological level of cadres and conducting patriotic production increase propaganda among the masses, one must also be good at using the following organizational forms:

    1.  Give full play to the role of people's representative meetings, and use the organizational forms of various professional representative meetings centered on the people's representative meetings to mobilize the masses. Shanxi's experience proves that this method is effective. Because the representatives attending various representative meetings are outstanding elements selected from the masses in each village, they have close ties with the masses, and can concentrate the opinions, creations, and experiences of the masses through them, and can also lead the scattered masses to fight for the realization of the various policies of the Party and the People's Government through them; in this way, the difficulty of a shortage of cadres can also be solved.

    2.  Link the form of representative meetings with the form of patriotic pledges. That is to use patriotic pledges to organize advanced, intermediate, and backward peasants. The representatives of various representative meetings must set an example and implement the spirit of the resolutions of the people's representative meetings into the patriotic pledges, so as to unify the actions of the broad masses of peasants.

    3.  Give full play to the role of "organizing." The Party and the People's Government should strengthen leadership over all temporary, small-scale, or long-term mutual aid teams with relatively good planning. Experience proves that it is very effective to promote scattered individual farmers to launch patriotic production increase competition movements through the masses participating in mutual aid teams.

    4.  Give full play to the role of the Party's propaganda network. Organize propagandists to carry out propaganda and mobilization work everywhere, promptly commend good typical examples among the masses, expose shortcomings and errors in the work, and point out ways to correct them, so as to closely integrate political tasks with economic tasks and promote the progress of production work.

    The experience of many advanced areas in Shanxi proves that if the above organizational forms can be well connected and used, the leadership principles of "from the masses, to the masses" and "combining leadership with the masses" can be realized; but at present, most cadres still have a tendency towards empiricism, and this erroneous tendency must be constantly criticized with the above new experience in order to effectively improve the leadership of agricultural production.

### 中共山西省委员会领导秋季爱国丰产运动的经验

    中共山西省委员会领导秋季爱国丰产运动的经验
    今年六月，山西省各地有不少党的领导机关和干部，将政治斗争任务和作好农业生产工作对立起来，准备放弃对农业生产的领导，而专门领导政治斗争。例如中共榆次县委认为：“搞不好镇压反革命工作是千年绊脚石。至于生产，今年耽误了，明年还可以搞。”特别自从山西全省展开大规模的抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动以后，农民群众的生产热情普遍提高，很多干部更发生了错觉，认为：“政治搞好了，生产自然会好起来。”“生产不用领导，群众也能干起来。”在这种片面思想支持之下，全省不少地区的农业生产一度陷于自流状态。
    中共山西省委为了保证爱国丰产计划的实现，针对干部的错误思想，及时采取了如下措施：
    一、在党内外开展了反对忽视领导农业生产的思想斗争。为此，曾在山西日报上著论重申中共中央关于“在农业生产季节，准确掌握以农业生产为农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务”的指示，严格批判
    “生产自流论”的错误观点；并阐明生产工作必须与政治工作密切结合的道理。
    二、为了贯彻中共中央的指示，全省抽调县级以上干部二千一百余人，组织了强大的农业生产检查团，由各级负责干部亲自率领，深入区、村进行检查，并帮助当地工作。
    三、以县、区为单位，召开党的代表会议，各界人民代表会议，宣传员代表会议，以及互助组（包括互助组长、劳动模范、技术能手等）、青年、妇女、民兵等各种代表会议。在这些会议上，对生产工作普遍进行了检查、动员和布置。参加以上各种会议的代表，全省有十万余人。这批力量对扭转生产领导的自流现象起了决定性的作用。
    四、以上各种会议的代表回村之后，在群众中积极展开活动：一方面继续进行抗美援朝的爱国主义政治教育；一方面以身作则，带领广大农民群众展开检查与修订爱国公约的运动，把爱国公约作为推动爱国丰产竞赛的有力武器。
    由于采取了上述措施，在全省范围内迅速掀起了爱国丰产竞赛的高潮。全省有二千五百个农业互助组向李顺达互助组应战，有十五万个农业互助组相互展开了爱国丰产竞赛，超过了夏季竞赛的规模，保证了今年丰产竞赛计划的实现。全省有三千七百万亩谷物较往年普遍多锄一遍，一千余万亩玉茭、高粱大部上了追肥。为了消灭蔓延着的棉蚜灾害，有一百二十余万农民群众卷入了扑灭棉蚜运动，将三百余万亩耕地面积上的棉蚜全部扑灭。使群众相信了科学技术的力量，相信了组织起来的力量，相信了生产必须领导的道理。为了防汛保苗，各地都注意进行挑挖渠道，加高堤岸，作好闸堰的工作。在汛期内完成重要的防洪工程四十余处，挖蓄水坑七万八千余个，排水渠二万二千六百余条，沿河防洪造林一百七十万株，大大减少了雨涝成灾的可能性，今年的水害已比去年显著减轻。
    由于各地在爱国丰产运动中普遍注意了爱国主义的政治宣传，使绝大多数互助组都订立了爱国公约，并且成立了读报组。经过政治宣传，农民对工农联盟、城乡互助的认识，有了显著的提高。他们对种植各种经济作物（如棉、烟叶、麻等）的积极性提高了；而且更加注意了提高经济作物的单位面积产量。目前秋收已结束，除受灾地区外，一般都完成或超额完成了丰产计划。有些农民创造了提高单位面积产量的榜样。如曲耀离的水地棉花，每亩收到九百二十斤籽棉；温国思的水地小麦每亩产七百一十五斤；赵德宽旱地玉蜀黍每亩地产九百三十斤；邵双合的谷子每亩平均产八百四十五斤。
    根据这一段的运动看来，把分散的农业生产者组织起来，开展大规模的生产运动，除了提高干部政治思想水平，并在群众中进行爱国丰产的宣传外，还必须善于运用以下组织形式：
    一、充分发挥人民代表会议的作用，并以人民代表会议为中心，运用各种专业代表会议的组织形式去发动群众。山西的经验证明，这种方法是有效的。因为出席各种代表会议的代表，都是由各村群众中选拔出来的优秀分子，他们和群众有密切的联系，可以经过他们集中群众的意见、创造和经验，又可以经过他们去带动分散的群众一块去为实现党与人民政府的各种政策而斗争；这样，干部缺少的困难也可以解决了。
    二、把代表会议的形式和爱国公约的形式联结起来。这就是要运用爱国公约去组织先进的、中间的、落后的农民群众。各种代表会议的代表要以身作则，把人民代表会议的决议精神，贯彻到爱国公约中，以便把广大农民群众的行动统一起来。
    三、充分发挥“组织起来”的作用。对一切临时的、小型的或长年的而且计划性较好的互助组，党和人民政府都应该加强领导。经验证明：通过参加互助组的群众去推动分散的个体农民以开展爱国丰产竞赛运动，是很有效的办法。
    四、发挥党的宣传网的作用。组织宣传员到处展开宣传鼓动工作，及时地表扬群众中好的典型，揭发工作中的缺点和错误，并指出改正的办法，以便把政治任务与经济任务紧密结合起来，推动生产工作前进。
    山西许多先进地区的经验证明，上述各项组织形式如能很好地联系运用，就能够实现“从群众中来到群众中去”和“领导与群众相结合”的领导原则；但目前大多数干部仍然存在着经验主义的偏向，必须用以上新的经验，不断地批判这种错误的倾向，才能有效地改进对农业生产的领导工作。
