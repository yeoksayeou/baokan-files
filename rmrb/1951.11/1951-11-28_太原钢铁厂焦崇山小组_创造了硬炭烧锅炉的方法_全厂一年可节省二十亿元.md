    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Jiao Chongshan Group
    Creates Method for Burning Hard Coke in Boilers
    Plant Can Save Two Billion Yuan Annually
    Editor: The Jiao Chongshan group of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created a method of using hard coke (waste material from coking, also called stone coal, containing 30 percent coal) to replace Nine-Foot Coal (referring to coal from the Nine-Foot Coal Seam) for burning boilers, which can save two billion yuan in one year. After learning from the advanced experience of the Northeast worker brothers who increased grain production by 10 million tons for the country in one year, the Jiao Chongshan group loudly put forward the slogan of learning from the Northeast worker brothers. All the workers in the group put their minds to work and launched a heat wave of increasing production and practicing economy. Jiang Rongsheng, a worker in the group, thought: If hard coke can barely be used for cooking, why can't it be used for burning boilers? So he took hard coke to experiment with burning boilers. The result was that the flames were good, but there was too much slag. Jiang brought it up at the group meeting for discussion, and after everyone's hard research, a series of operating methods for burning boilers were improved. The group's experiment was finally successful, not only ensuring that the machine equipment was not affected, but also guaranteeing the output. If the whole plant uses hard coke, according to preliminary statistics, it can save two billion yuan annually.

    太原钢铁厂焦崇山小组
    创造了硬炭烧锅炉的方法
    全厂一年可节省二十亿元
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂焦崇山小组创造了硬炭（炼焦后的废料，又叫石炭，含煤量百分之三十）代替九尺煤（指九尺煤层的煤）烧锅炉的方法，一年内就可节省二十亿元。焦崇山小组学习了东北工人兄弟一年内给国家增产一千万吨粮食的先进经验以后，响亮地提出了向东北工人兄弟看齐的口号。全组工友开动了脑筋，掀起了增产节约的热潮。该组工友姜容生想：硬炭能够勉强做饭，为什么不能够烧锅炉呢？所以他便拿硬炭试验烧锅炉，其结果火苗倒是不错，就是渣子太多。姜就提到小组会上讨论，经过大家的苦心研究，改进了烧锅炉的一系列的操作方法。该组试验结果，终于获得了成功，不但使机器设备不受影响，还保证了产量。如果全厂都用硬炭，据初步统计，每年就可节省二十亿元。
