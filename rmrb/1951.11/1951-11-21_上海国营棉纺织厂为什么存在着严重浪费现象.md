Why Are There Serious Waste Phenomena in Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Textile Factories?
Lè Jìng

    In the past two years, state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai have made significant progress in terms of increasing production and reducing costs compared to any period before liberation. Last winter, the national cotton textile industry launched a campaign to increase the production of 20-count yarn to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers. Shanghai alone (including private cotton textile factories) increased yarn production by more than 37,000 pieces, and created a national record of 1.23 pounds of output per unit. This April, the monthly output of yarn and cloth in Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories exceeded the highest level before liberation by 10 to 22 percent. Waste has also been reduced compared to before liberation, with factories saving an average of 1.75 billion yuan per month just from the reduction of substandard cloth. However, if we examine the production situation of Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories in the past two years according to the standards required by the state, it must be admitted that there are still serious waste phenomena. This serious waste phenomenon affects the accumulation of state funds and must be overcome.
    
    Waste Phenomena Are Extremely Serious

    According to preliminary statistics from the East China Textile Administration in May of this year, the losses caused by waste such as substandard cloth, recycled cotton, and raw materials in Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories and dyeing factories in one month alone amounted to 8.33 billion yuan. Based on the preliminary statistics for May, it is estimated that cotton textile factories lose 20.2 billion yuan annually due to raw cotton waste, 13.8 billion yuan due to mechanical and electrical material waste, and 27.9 billion yuan due to excessive substandard cloth. Dyeing factories lose nearly 20 billion yuan annually due to excessive substandard cloth and 12 billion yuan due to cotton textile waste recycled cotton. If we add the waste statistics from knitting and woolen textile factories, the total annual loss due to waste amounts to a staggering 150 billion yuan. If this amount were saved and used to develop the cotton textile industry, it could add the complete equipment for 45,000 spindles annually.

    Units with more serious waste situations include the weaving department of the No. 9 State-Owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory. According to the factory's own statistics, the average monthly oil-stained cloth (a type of substandard cloth) reaches more than 50 percent. According to the East China Textile Administration's regulation of a price reduction of 27,000 yuan per piece of bleached substandard cloth, the total oil-stained cloth produced by the factory since liberation until the end of May this year has cost 4 billion yuan. If we add other substandard cloth (excluding oil-stained cloth), recycled cotton, mechanical and electrical materials, and labor waste, the total loss in the past two years amounts to 9 billion yuan. After May of this year, the waste situation in the factory not only did not improve but continued to worsen. Recently, during the campaign to increase production, more than 20 looms were shut down due to the insufficient supply of yarn cones, and the amount of short-length cloth has also increased significantly. The waste phenomena in the No. 10 and No. 12 State-Owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factories are also very serious. In the two years from June 1949 to May 1951, the weaving department of the No. 10 State-Owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory produced 144,557 more pieces of substandard cloth than the bureau's standard. At a price reduction of 27,000 yuan per piece, the loss is nearly 3.9 billion yuan. The average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in the spinning department reached 411.65 catties (calculated as 20-count yarn), exceeding the bureau's standard by 6.65 catties, resulting in a loss of 2.8 billion yuan based on the total output in the past two years. In addition, the factory lost 1 billion yuan due to excessive recycled cotton and 1.3 billion yuan due to waste of bobbins and shuttles in the past two years. The total value of the above five items alone amounts to 9 billion yuan (other mechanical and electrical materials, labor, electricity, and other wastes are not included). According to preliminary checks by the administrative department of the No. 12 State-Owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory, the factory lost a total of 1.87 billion yuan due to waste of cotton, substandard cloth, and shuttles in the first half of 1951. In the first half of this year, the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in the spinning department was 2.96 to 5.43 catties higher than the standard that had been achieved after liberation, resulting in an excess consumption of 121,375 catties of raw cotton based on the half-year output. The average rate of substandard cloth to standard cloth in the weaving department of the factory was 12.88 percent, and the average rate for serge was 5 percent. Compared with the lowest substandard cloth rate achieved after liberation, a total of 27,124 more pieces of substandard cloth were produced in half a year. The shuttle consumption of the factory was an average of 1.86 pieces per loom per month. Based on the prescribed standard of 0.8 pieces, 8,700 more shuttles were consumed in half a year. The waste phenomenon in the No. 1 State-Owned Printing and Dyeing Factory is also alarming. According to incomplete statistics, the factory lost more than 14.5 billion yuan due to waste of substandard cloth and raw materials in the past two years.

    Failure to Rely on Workers to Develop Production is the Main Cause of Waste

    The main reason for the above-mentioned serious waste phenomenon is that the administrative leaders of the enterprises are unable to distinguish between the different natures of the bureaucrat-capital enterprises and the new China's state-owned enterprises and the different enterprise management principles that arise as a result. Their understanding of the idea that they must rely on the working class to do a good job in production is not clear enough. Some even mistakenly believe that "relying on the working class to do a good job in production is correct, but the workers in our factory are particularly backward and cannot be relied upon." Therefore, the administrative leaders of these factories have not done a good job in mobilizing the masses, and they have failed to give full play to the high level of enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to fight against serious waste phenomena in a planned manner. The factory management committees of many factories are merely a formality and do not play a role. Some administrative leaders do not attach importance to or do not pay enough attention to the rationalization proposals of the staff and workers, which affects the development of the rationalization proposal movement and the improvement of the production enthusiasm of the workers. Secondly, after the liberation of Shanghai, until the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the city on April 27 this year, the counter-revolutionaries lurking in the factories were still quite rampant. They provoked the unity of staff and workers, undermined the relationship between the Party and the masses, and sabotaged machinery, equipment, and finished products in various ways, seriously affecting the improvement of the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the workers. In addition, many administrative leaders of the factories have the wrong idea of only focusing on production, not on management, not on production costs, and not on profits and losses. Some administrative leaders and some workers also have a complacent mood due to the increase in production, thinking that "the Communist Party is good and will get better, production has increased since liberation, and the tasks have been completed or overfulfilled. What waste can be opposed?" Therefore, they turn a blind eye to the serious waste phenomenon. At the same time, the factory management system is not scientific enough, there is no (or it is not sound) workshop original record system, the labor allocation and wage system are not reasonable enough, the trade union work has not been able to face production well for a considerable period, and the decoupling of political movements and production are also important reasons for the waste phenomenon.

    Formulating Technical and Material Consumption Quotas is a Good Way to Eliminate Waste and Increase Production

    After the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers in the factories has soared to an unprecedented level. This is a powerful guarantee for achieving the East China Textile Administration's plan to increase production and economize in the fourth quarter of this year and throughout next year. At present, Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories are carrying out a winter campaign to increase production, and are continuing to carry out the democratic unity movement and the work of clearing up assets and verifying funds. The successful completion of these movements can all achieve the results of increasing production and eliminating waste. The administrative leaders of the factories should establish the basic idea of relying on the working class to do a good job in enterprises in these movements, thoroughly change the past supply-based work style of only focusing on production and not on management, and gradually implement the economic accounting system. At the same time, they should vigorously promote various advanced experiences, widely carry out mass rationalization proposal movements, rationally use labor, and formulate various technical quotas and raw material consumption quotas to eliminate waste, increase production, and accumulate more funds for the country.

    上海国营棉纺织厂为什么存在着严重浪费现象
    乐静
    上海国营各棉纺织工厂，两年余来，不论就增加生产或减低成本那一方面来讲，较之解放以前的任何时期，都有着显著的进步。去年冬季，全国棉纺织工业曾展开了二十支纱的突击增产运动，以适应广大农民的需要。上海一地（包括私营棉纺织厂）即增产纱三万七千余件，并创造了单位产量一点二三磅的全国纪录。今年四月，上海国营棉纺织厂纱和布的月产量已超过解放前最高水平百分之十到百分之二十二。浪费现象也较解放前减少，各厂仅因次布减少，每月平均就可节省十七亿五千余万元。但是，若以国家所要求的标准来检查两年余来上海国营各棉纺织厂的生产情况，应该承认：还存在着严重的浪费现象。这种严重的浪费现象，影响着国家资金的积累，必须加以克服。
      浪费现象十分严重
    据华东纺织管理局今年五月份的初步统计，一个月内，上海国营各棉纺织厂和各印染厂，因次布、回丝及原物料等项浪费所造成的损失，即达人民币八十三亿三千余万元。以五月份的初步统计为标准，估计各棉纺织厂每年因原棉浪费要损失二百零二亿元，因机物料浪费要损失一百三十八亿元，因多出次布要损失二百七十九亿元；各印染厂每年因多出次布要损失近二百亿元，因棉纺下脚回丝要损失一百二十亿元。如再加上针织、毛纺各厂的浪费统计，全年因浪费而损失的人民币达一千五百亿元之巨。倘若节约这笔数字，用来发展棉纺织工业，每年即可因此增添四万五千枚纱锭的全部设备。
    浪费情况较严重的单位，据已知者为国营上海第九棉纺织厂织部。根据该厂自己的统计，平均每月油渍布（次布的一种）达百分之五十以上，依照华东纺织管理局规定的每匹漂白次布以减价二万七千元计算，该厂自解放以来至今年五月底止，所出全部油渍布，共要耗损人民币四十亿元；如再加上其他次布（不包括油渍布）、回丝、机物料及人力等浪费，两年余来共损失人民币九十亿元。今年五月以后，该厂的浪费情况不仅没有改善，并且继续发展。最近该厂在突击增产中，因盘头供应不上，布机间关车二十余部；短码布也大量增加。国营上海第十、十二棉纺织厂的浪费现象也十分严重。国营上海第十棉纺织厂自一九四九年六月至一九五一年五月的两年中，织部出次布超过局定标准一四四、五五七匹，每匹次布以减价二万七千元计，损失近三十九亿元；纺部每件纱的平均用棉量要扯到四一一点六五斤（折合二十支纱计算），超过局定标准六点六五斤，依两年来的全部产量计算，即损失二十八亿元。此外该厂两年来因回丝过多损失十亿元，筒管、梭子浪费共损失十三亿元，仅上述五项的浪费总值即达九十亿元（其他机物料、人力、电力等浪费尚未包括在内）。据国营上海棉纺织第十二厂行政方面的初步检查，一九五一年上半年，该厂因用棉、次布和梭子等三项的浪费，共损失人民币十八亿七千余万元。今年上半年该厂纺部每件纱的用棉量，平均较解放后已达到过的标准要多耗用二点九六到五点四三市斤，按半年的产量计算，计多耗用原棉十二万一千三百七十五市斤；该厂织部次布率市布平均为百分之十二点八十八，哔叽平均为百分之五，与解放后曾达到过的最低次布率相比较，总计半年内多出次布二万七千一百二十四匹。该厂梭子消耗量每台布机每月平均一点八六只，如以规定的○·八只标准计算，半年中即多消耗梭子八千七百只。国营第一印染厂的浪费现象也很惊人，据不完全统计，该厂两年来因次布和原物料等浪费，共损失人民币一百四十五亿元以上。
    不依靠工人发展生产是造成
    浪费的主要原因
    造成以上严重浪费现象的原因，主要是企业的行政领导干部对官僚资本企业与新中国国营企业的不同性质及因此而产生的不同的企业管理原则分辨不清，他们对于必须依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想还不够明确；有人竟错误地认为：“依靠工人阶级搞好生产是对的，但我们厂里的工人特别落后，不能依靠”，因此，这些厂的行政领导干部就没有很好地去发动群众，就不能发挥群众的高度的积极性和创造性，向严重的浪费现象有计划的进行斗争。许多厂的工厂管理委员会徒具形式，不起作用。部分行政领导干部不重视或不够重视职工群众的合理化建议，影响合理化建议运动的开展，和工人群众生产积极性的提高。其次是上海解放以后，至今年四月二十七日全市大张旗鼓镇压反革命时止，潜伏在各工厂的反革命分子还相当猖獗，他们挑拨职工团结，破坏党群关系，并以各种方法破坏机器设备和生产成品，严重影响了工人群众政治觉悟和生产积极性的提高。此外，不少厂的行政领导干部存在着只问生产，不问经营，不计生产成本，不计盈亏的错误思想；某些厂的行政领导干部及部分工人群众，还因生产的提高，产生了自满情绪，认为：“共产党好了还要好，解放以后生产增加了，任务都完成或超额完成了，还有什么浪费可以反？”因而对严重浪费现象熟视无睹。同时，工厂管理制度不够科学，没有（即或有也不健全）车间原始纪录制度，人力调配和工资制度不够合理，工会工作在相当时间内不能很好地面向生产，以及政治运动和生产脱节等也是造成浪费现象的重要原因。
    制订技术和材料消耗定额是
    杜绝浪费增加生产的好办法
    经过抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动和劳动保险条例的实施，各厂工人群众的爱国热情空前高涨。这是实现华东纺织管理局制订的今年第四季度和明年全年增产节约计划的有力保证。目前上海国营各棉纺织厂正在开展冬季突击增产运动，继续进行民主团结运动和清理资产核定资金的工作。这些运动的胜利完成，都可达到增加生产、消灭浪费的结果。各厂的行政领导干部应该在这些运动中，树立起依靠工人阶级搞好企业的基本思想，彻底改变过去只管生产不问经营的供给制思想作风，逐步实行经济核算制。同时，应该大力推广各种先进经验，广泛地开展群众性的合理化建议运动，合理使用劳动力，制订各种技术定额和原材料消耗定额，以杜绝浪费，增加生产，为国家积累更多的资金。
