	Fully Exploit the Propaganda Role of Nearly Ten Thousand Slide Projectors Nationwide

	The slide projector is a powerful new weapon for conducting patriotic education among the broad masses of the people and enriching the cultural life of the people. In the past two years, slide projector work has developed extremely rapidly. According to incomplete statistics at the end of October, there were 9,943 slide projectors in the country. These slide projectors are shown in vast urban and rural areas and have been warmly welcomed by the people. For example, in many areas of Henan Province, when slides are shown, they attract people from nearby ten or twenty miles away to watch "local movies" with their own food. In some places, one slide show attracts thousands of viewers. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of slide projector viewers last year reached 80 million. If nearly ten thousand slide projectors across the country are fully utilized, each projecting at least four times a month, with an audience of 500 people each time, there could be 240 million viewers in a year. One can imagine how great the impact of slide projector propaganda is.

	Slide projector manufacturing and projection are relatively simple and easy to carry, making them suitable as tools for popularizing propaganda and education. Moreover, slide projectors have two advantages: First, materials can be obtained locally, and films can be made and used in a timely manner, which can be coordinated with the central work at the time and in the locality, and propaganda and education can be carried out in response to the people's thoughts. Many places have made slides based on actual situations in mass movements and production work such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, which are of great educational significance to the local people. Second, when slides are shown with appropriate explanations (some also with music, clapper talk, ventriloquism, etc.), the masses can easily understand them, which is suitable for the current acceptance ability of many working people. Therefore, vigorously promoting slide projector work is of great significance.

	In order to promote slide projector work, the first thing to solve is the issue of training and educating cadres. On the one hand, various regions must plan to train a batch of slide projector workers; on the other hand, they must strengthen the ideological leadership of slide projector workers so that they can establish the idea of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the current political tasks. They should also be organized to exchange experiences, improve their skills, and continuously improve their work.

	The second is to solve the supply of slide projectors and slides. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 16 institutions in the country manufacturing slide projectors, but most of them are in North China and East China. In many places, slide projectors are made by slide projector workers themselves in a simple and crude way. In order to carry out slide projector propaganda work, relevant parties should plan to supply slide projector workers with inexpensive and high-quality slide projectors. There are now nearly ten thousand slide projectors in the country, but there are still very few institutions specializing in making slides. Various regions should, on the one hand, find ways to plan to manufacture new films in large quantities, and on the other hand, pay attention to cultivating the ability of slide projector workers to make their own films. Art workers in various regions should actively participate in or assist in this work needed by the broad masses of the people. In addition, it is also very important to absorb, unite, and transform old artists with painting skills to participate in the production of slides. Picture magazines, newspapers, and magazines in various regions should also pay attention to publishing some comic strips suitable as slide projector materials for slide projector workers to choose from.

### 充分发挥全国近万架幻灯机的宣传作用

    充分发挥全国近万架幻灯机的宣传作用
    幻灯是新兴的向广大人民群众进行爱国主义教育、充实人民群众文化生活的有力武器。两年来幻灯工作发展极为迅速。据十月底的不完全统计，全国已有幻灯机九千九百四十三架。这些幻灯机在广大城乡放映，获得了人民群众的热烈欢迎。如河南省许多地区在放映幻灯时，吸引了附近十里、二十里的群众带着干粮来看“土电影”。有的地方放映一场幻灯，观众达数千人。据不完全统计，去年幻灯观众共达八千万人。全国近万架幻灯机如果充分发挥作用，每架最少每月放映四次，每次观众以五百人计，一年中可能就有观众二亿四千万。幻灯宣传的影响有多么大，可以想见。
    幻灯制造和放映都比较简单，携带方便，因此适宜于作为普及宣传教育的工具。而且幻灯还有两个优点，第一、可以就地取材，及时制片应用，能配合当时当地中心工作，针对群众思想进行宣传教育。许多地方在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等群众运动和生产工作中，结合实际取材制成幻灯片放映，对当地群众教育意义很大。第二、幻灯片放映时配合适当的解说（有的还配合音乐、快板、口技等），群众易看易懂，适于目前许多劳动人民的接受能力。因此，大力推广幻灯工作是有重大意义的。
    为了推广幻灯工作，首先要解决培养、教育干部的问题。各地一方面要有计划地训练一批幻灯工作人材；另方面要加强幻灯工作者的思想领导，使他们树立为工农兵服务、为当前政治任务服务的思想。还应组织他们交流经验，提高技术，不断地改进工作。
    其次是要解决幻灯机与幻灯片的供应问题。据不完全统计，全国现有制造幻灯机的机构十六处，但绝大部分是在华北和华东。许多地方的幻灯机，是幻灯工作者自己因陋就简地制造的。为了开展幻灯的宣传工作，有关方面应该有计划地供给幻灯工作者以价廉物美的幻灯机。全国现在已有近万架幻灯机，但专门制造幻灯片的机构还很少。各地应该一面想出办法有计划地大批制造新片，一面注意培养幻灯工作者自己制片的能力。各地美术工作者应该踊跃参加或协助这一为广大人民群众所需要的工作。另外，吸收、团结、改造有绘画能力的旧艺人来参加幻灯片的制作也是很重要的。各地的画报、报纸、杂志，也应注意刊登一些适于作幻灯材料的连环画，以供幻灯工作者选用。
