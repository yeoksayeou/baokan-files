    Our Higher Industrial Education Must Be Reformed
    Shi Jiayang, Dean of the School of Engineering, Tsinghua University
    This meeting of deans of engineering schools not only reached a consensus on the adjustment of departments and faculties, solving a problem that had been unresolved for two years; but also formulated a concrete plan for large-scale enrollment in 1952. This is indeed a major event in our country's advance towards industrialization.

    For the past two years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, higher education in New China has been successful; however, a serious shortcoming still exists in our higher education, that is, our universities still inherit the university forms of capitalist countries, and they cannot train a large number of industrial cadres to meet the needs of national defense construction and economic construction. To eliminate this shortcoming, we must bravely do two major things: one is the adjustment of departments and faculties, concentrating scattered teachers and equipment, and liberating the potential of engineering schools across the country to train industrial cadres. The other is to break away from the traditional view of universities in the past, so that universities can be transformed into multi-track cadre training institutions, including three- to five-year undergraduate programs, one- to two-year specialized courses, and half-year to one-year short-term training courses. With this kind of systemic reform, our higher education can be considered thoroughly reformed, so that it will not be divorced from the needs of the people and can truly serve the people.

    At this meeting of deans of engineering schools, Minister Ma Xulun and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government all emphasized: all departments and faculties must make planned adjustments, focus on division of labor, concentrate teachers and equipment, use them rationally, and give full play to existing strengths to train more and better cadres, in order to accelerate our country's industrialization; at the same time, it is necessary to break away from traditional thinking in the past, adopt the principle of combining long-term training with short-term training, and currently focus on short-term training to overcome the difficulty of cadre shortage; adjustments must adhere to the principle of frugality, making do with what is available, and opposing extravagance and waste; henceforth, the training of technical cadres must not only strengthen technical education, but also strengthen political education; everything must be done with a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to complete the task. These instructions are very correct. The adjustment plan of departments and faculties is to adopt key adjustments, starting first from North China, East China, and Central South China. Now the preliminary adjustment results in each region have changed the situation of industrial education across the country. Obviously, the adjusted colleges and universities have enough teachers in each department, and teaching is becoming more specialized. After the concentration of material resources and the increase in students, the efficiency of equipment use will naturally be greatly improved. In the next five to ten years, adopting the principle of focusing on specialized courses in training will certainly be able to meet the needs of industrial construction in terms of the quantity of cadre training.

    The adjustment plan of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government was supported by all universities, business departments, and all the representatives present at the meeting. After political study and ideological transformation, our teachers have been able to overcome incorrect thoughts such as individualism, sectarianism, and departmentalism in the past, so that the adjustment work of colleges and universities can proceed smoothly.

    After this meeting, the prospects for higher industrial education in New China are very bright. In a year or two, after the proper adjustments have been made in colleges and universities across the country, I believe that in terms of cadre training, not only will the quantity be resolved, but the quality will also be improved due to the concentration of teachers. After the separation of the schools of engineering, agriculture, and medicine from the old-style comprehensive universities, the teaching work of each department and faculty of the engineering schools can naturally be more specialized.

    We can also imagine the future development trend of higher industrial education: First, new-type multidisciplinary industrial universities, as the industry of New China develops and expands to a considerable extent, if environmental conditions are mature, will certainly follow the development laws of industrial education in the Soviet Union, and more specialized colleges, such as schools of architecture, schools of water conservancy, schools of mechanical manufacturing, and even schools of sugar making, will break away from their original bodies and expand into independent specialized colleges. Second, the system of combining long-term training with short-term training, when the supply of cadres can meet the needs of industrial sectors, and the national industrial technology level is generally improved in the same period, according to the requirements of quality, higher industrial schools will inevitably restore the normal long-term training system, and the graduation years will also be extended to at least five years. At that time, the theoretical science foundation needed by engineers must be strengthened, and professional training also needs to be deepened, so that the training of engineering technology and theoretical science is closely combined, and application and research become inseparable phenomena. Third, regarding the compilation of textbooks and reference books, after the adjustment of departments and faculties, if the compilation can be more planned under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and collective writing is promoted, then human and material resources can be prevented from being wasted. Fourth, regarding political education, Minister Ma Xulun and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun of the Ministry of Education have clearly pointed out at this meeting: We must not only strengthen technical education, but also strengthen political education for industrial education in the future. Therefore, engineers in New China must master advanced technology on the one hand, and study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on the other. In this way, our industrial cadres can become engineers who wholeheartedly serve the people. Fifth, in terms of teachers, after strengthening political study and ideological transformation, they will inevitably be able to completely obey the unified allocation of the government, so that the problem of teacher shortage in schools in border areas and the problem of uneven development among schools can be solved.

    The National Conference of Deans of Engineering Schools was a success. It is estimated that the number of students enrolled by each school next year will be one to four times more than this year. We must carefully plan under the principle of thrift, make do with what is available, and do more with limited financial resources. The implementation of education focusing on specialized courses means that the number of students in specialized courses will be greater than the number of undergraduate students. It is not easy to take care of the coursework and ideological leadership of specialized course students who are numerous, of different levels, and study a wide variety of subjects, and it is also something we have not experienced in the past. Clearly, industrial education work in the future will be more complex and arduous than in the past, and our industrial educators must strengthen political study to meet new tasks.

    我们的高等工业教育必须改革
    清华大学工学院院长  施嘉炀
    这次工学院院长会议不特对于院系的调整取得了一致的意见，使两年来悬而未决的问题迎刃而解；而且拟订了一九五二年大量招生的具体方案。这实在是我国开始向工业化道路前进的一宗大事。
    两年以来，由于中央人民政府教育部的正确领导，新中国的高等教育是有成就的；但我们的高等教育还存在着一个严重的缺点，那就是我们的高等学校还承袭着资本主义国家的大学形式，它不能够大量培养工业干部来适应国防建设和经济建设的需要。要革除这个缺点，我们必须勇敢地做两个大事：一个是院系调整，把分散的师资与设备加以集中，把全国各工学院潜在的培养工业干部的能力解放出来。另一个是打破过去对大学的传统看法，使大学能够变为多轨制的干部训练机构，其中包括着三年至五年制的大学本科，一年至二年毕业的专修科与半年至一年毕业的短期训练班。有了这种制度上的改革，我们的高等教育才算有了彻底改革，才不致与人民的需求有距离而真能为人民服务。
    在这次工学院院长会议上，中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长和钱俊瑞、曾昭抡两副部长都强调指出：各院系必须作有计划的调整，重点分工，集中师资与设备，加以合理使用，充分发挥现有的力量来培养更多更好的干部，以加速我们国家的工业化；同时要打破过去的传统思想，采用长期培养与短期训练相结合的方针，目前以短期训练为重点，以突破干部缺乏的难关；调整时必须遵守节约原则，因陋就简，反对铺张浪费；此后训练技术干部不只要加强技术教育，还要加强政治教育；一切用革命的精神和革命的方法来完成任务。这些指示都是非常正确的。关于院系调整方案，是采取重点调整，先从华北、华东与中南三区开始。现在各区初步调整的结果，已经使全国工业教育的情况有所改观。很明显地，调整后的院校，每系可有足够的师资，教学更趋专门化。物力集中、学生增多后，设备的使用效率自然大为提高。最近五年至十年中采取以专修科为重点的训练原则，在干部培养的数量上，也一定可以适合工业建设的需要。
    中央人民政府教育部的调整方案，在这次会议上受到各大学、各业务部门以及到会全体代表的拥护。我们教师经过政治学习与思想改造后，能够克服过去的个人主义、宗派主义与本位主义等不正确的思想，使院校的调整工作顺利地进行。
    经过这次会议以后，新中国高等工业教育的远景是非常灿烂的。一两年后，全国高等学校由于进行了适当的调整，我相信在干部的培养上不只在量的方面得到解决，质的方面也一定因为师资的集中得到提高。在旧型综合性大学工、农、医各学院都分出以后，工学院各科系的教学工作自然可以做到更专门化。
    我们还可以想像到此后高等工业教育的发展趋向：第一、新型的多科性工业大学，随着新中国工业的发展，扩充到相当程度后，如环境条件成熟，一定会如苏联工业教育的发展规律，更专精的专门学院，如同建筑学院、水利学院、机械制造学院、甚至制糖学院等，都会脱离原来的母体，扩展成为一个独立的专门学院。第二、长期培养与短期训练相结合的制度，等到部干的供应可以适合产业部门的需要时，在同时期内全国工业技术水平普遍提高后，依据质的要求，必然使高等工业学校恢复到正常的长期培养制度，而且毕业年限还会延长到至少五年。那时，工程师所需要的理论科学基础必须加强，专业训练也需要加深，做到工程技术与理论科学的训练密切结合，应用与研究变成不可分离的现象。第三、关于教科书与参考书的编著，在院系调整以后，如能在中央人民政府教育部统一领导下，使编著较有计划性，提倡集体写作，则人力物力方面可以不致浪费。第四、关于政治教育方面，在这次会议上教育部马叙伦部长和钱俊瑞、曾昭抡两副部长都已经明确指出：我们此后对工业教育，不只要加强技术教育，还要加强政治教育。所以新中国的工程师一方面必须掌握高等技术，另一方面要学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。这样，我们的工业干部才能成为全心全意为人民服务的工程师。第五、在教师方面，加强政治学习与思想改造后，必然可以做到完全服从政府的统一调配，使边疆地区学校师资缺乏问题与各学校间发展不平衡的问题，得到解决。
    全国工学院院长会议是成功了。据估计，各校明年招生数量要比今年多一倍至四倍，我们必须在节约的原则下精打细算，因陋就简，用有限的财力做更多的事情。而以专修科为重点的教育的实施，专修科学生数要比本科学生数为多。人数众多，程度不同，学习种类繁杂的专修科学生课业的照顾与思想领导，是极不容易的事，也是我们过去所没有经验过的。很清楚地，此后的工业教育工作是要比过去复杂艰巨，我们工业教育工作者必需加强政治学习，来迎接新的任务。
