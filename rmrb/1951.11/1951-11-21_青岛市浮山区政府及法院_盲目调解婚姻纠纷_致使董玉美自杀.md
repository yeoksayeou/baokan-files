    Qingdao Fushan District Government and Court
    Blindly Mediate Marital Disputes
    Leading to Dong Yumei's Suicide
    To the Editor: The Qingdao Fushan District People's Government and People's Court exhibit serious bureaucracy, blindly mediating marital disputes, resulting in Dong Yumei's suicide and death. Dong Yumei and Zhang Yongxiu were introduced through a matchmaker in April 1950, and their marriage was arranged by their parents, registering at the district government. After marriage, their feelings were incompatible, and the woman was also abused by her mother-in-law. In June of the same year, she filed for divorce with the district government, but after mediation, she returned home. In October, she again filed for divorce, but because the man refused, she was referred to the court. The court mediated three times without approving the divorce. The woman, feeling hopeless about the divorce, hanged herself on January 26, 1951. Before Dong Yumei, Zhang Yongxiu had two wives who had both been abused and ran away by his mother. Zhang Yongxiu had once attempted suicide by jumping into a well but survived. Based on the above, it is clear that the Fushan District People's Government and People's Court failed to discover that the marriage was arranged by parents when Dong Yumei and Zhang Yongxiu registered their marriage, and they also failed to thoroughly understand their family situation when considering the divorce, blindly mediating, leading to the suicide of a woman. The bureaucratic style of the district government and court is very serious. It is worth checking and should be paid attention to whether there are similar situations in other places when dealing with marital disputes.

    青岛市浮山区政府及法院
    盲目调解婚姻纠纷
    致使董玉美自杀
    编辑同志：青岛市浮山区人民政府与人民法院官僚主义严重，盲目调解婚姻纠纷，致使董玉美自杀身死。董玉美于一九五○年四月与张永秀经媒人介绍，双方父母包办，在区政府登记结婚。婚后感情不合，女方并受其婆母虐待。同年六月即到区政府提出离婚请求，经调解后回家。十月又到区提出离婚，因男方不肯，介绍到法院处理。法院调解三次未批准离婚。女方感到离婚无望，于一九五一年一月二十六日自缢身死。在董玉美之前，张永秀就有过两个老婆，都先后被其母虐待逃走，张永秀曾因此跳井自杀未死。根据以上情况，可见浮山区人民政府和人民法院在董玉美、张永秀登记结婚时，即未发现是双方父母包办，而在离婚时亦未深入了解其家庭情况，盲目地进行调解，以致发生妇女自杀事件。该区区政府及法院的官僚主义作风，是十分严重的。其他地方在处理婚姻纠纷时，不知有无类似情况，值得检查并应引起注意。　赵文钧
