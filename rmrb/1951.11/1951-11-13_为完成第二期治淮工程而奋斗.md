　　Striving to Complete the Second Phase of the Huai River Project
    The second year of the Huai River project is about to begin on a large scale.

    The main content of this phase of the project includes, in the upper reaches, the completion of the Baisha and Banqiao reservoirs, the commencement of the Bo Mountain and Nanwan reservoirs, and the dredging and construction of sluice gates on the Hong River, Ru River, Ying River, and the Yellow River flooded area; in the middle reaches, the construction of the Foziling Reservoir on the Pi River, the construction of the Wa埠 Lake and Shouxi Lake flood storage projects, and the implementation of the flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Hong River, the large-scale tributary dredging and inland water drainage projects from Zhengyangguan to Wuhe and from Wuhe to Hongze Lake, including the diversion of internal and external water in the Fushan-Wuhe section, and the excavation of the Ancient River (part of the project to separate the Huai River and Hongze Lake); in the lower reaches, in addition to flood control projects, the construction of the Subei Grand Irrigation Canal project will also begin. After the completion of this phase of the project, it will play a greater role in flood control; vast areas will also be free from inland waterlogging disasters; the irrigation, alkali washing, and soil improvement work on more than 20 million mu of land in northern Jiangsu will also be laid a foundation.

    The main features of this phase of the project are: First, the scale is huge, the total amount of work is about 160% of the first phase, and the tasks in individual regions are twice as large as the first phase; Second, this year, land reform will be carried out in areas of the Huai River basin where land reform was not carried out last year. After obtaining land in the land reform, the masses will have a more eager demand for water conservancy construction. However, carrying out two huge tasks simultaneously will cause a certain degree of difficulty in the allocation of cadres and mass forces; Third, in terms of project content, there are more dredging and excavation projects than in the first phase, and the proportion of technically complex projects such as the construction of reservoirs in the entire project is also larger than in the first phase. Therefore, this phase of the project will be much more difficult than the first phase.

    "We must repair the Huai River well." Our people have responded to Chairman Mao's great call and have already made brilliant achievements in the first phase of the Huai River project. In the second year of the project, as long as we are good at promoting experience and appropriately overcome new difficulties, we will surely achieve greater victories.

    What should be paid attention to in the second year of the Huai River project?

    First of all, in terms of planning, preparation, and construction, there must be maximum planning to overcome all waste of manpower and materials. The main and technically complex projects must be carefully studied and prudently designed; if the conditions are not ripe, it is better to postpone the construction. Secondly, due to the particularly huge project tasks, it is necessary to think of all methods to improve work efficiency in order to reduce the contradictions between water control and agricultural production. In the first phase of the project, there are many experiences in organizational work, political work, financial and health work, technical work, and the use of new and old tools, which need to be summarized and improved. Again, the first phase of the project only completed 15% of the entire project due to winter construction, resulting in hasty passivity in spring construction. This year, we must do a good job in planning and preparation and strive to complete more projects in winter to reduce the difficulties during the busy spring farming season. Finally, in areas where land reform is carried out this year, we must make appropriate divisions of labor and coordination in terms of time and manpower for these two major tasks so that both major tasks can be successfully completed. In addition, the Huai River project must be combined with the movement to increase production and practice economy and support the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The experience of the first phase of the project proves that the masses' soaring revolutionary enthusiasm is the main factor in overcoming all difficulties. We must continue to grasp this successful experience and stir up the revolutionary upsurge of the masses to strive to complete the second phase of the Huai River project.

　　为完成第二期治淮工程而奋斗
    第二年度的治淮工程，就要大规模开工了。
    这一期工程的主要内容，在上游是完成白沙、板桥两个水库，开始兴修薄山、南湾两个水库，并进行洪河、汝河、颍河和黄泛区各河的疏浚建闸工程；在中游，是修筑渒河佛子岭水库，兴建瓦埠湖、寿西湖蓄洪工程，并举办洪河下游的分洪工程，正阳关至五河、五河至洪泽湖的规模巨大的支流疏浚和内水排除工程，其中包括浮山五河段内外水分流的工程，和开挖古河的工程（是使淮河和洪泽湖分家的一部分工程）；在下游，除去防洪工程以外，并要开始兴修苏北大灌溉渠工程。这一期工程完成以后，在防御洪水方面，将发生更大的作用；广大地区，并可免除内涝之灾；苏北二千余万亩土地的灌溉、洗碱和改良土壤工作，也同时建立了基础。
    这一期工程的主要特点是：第一，规模巨大，工程的总量约当第一期工程的百分之一百六十，个别地区的任务，比第一期工程要大一倍；第二，淮河流域去年没有进行土地改革的地区，今年都要进行土地改革，群众在土地改革中获得土地之后，对兴修水利的要求会更加热切，但是，两个巨大的任务同时进行，在干部和群众力量的配备上，会感到一定程度的困难；第三，在工程内容上，疏浚挖河的工程比第一期为多，兴建水库等技术性较高的工程，在全部工程中所占的比例，也比第一期为大。因此，这一期工程，将比第一期工程艰巨得多。
    “一定要把淮河修好。”我国人民响应毛主席的伟大的号召，已在第一期治淮工程中，作出辉煌的成绩。在第二年度工程中，只要善于推广经验，适当地克服新的困难，一定能获得更大的胜利。
    第二年度的治淮工程，应该注意些什么呢？
    首先，在计划、准备、施工各方面，必须要有最大的计划性，克服一切人力物力的浪费。主要的和技术性较高的工程，尤其必须经过详细的研究，审慎的设计；条件不成熟时，宁可暂缓施工。其次，由于工程任务特别巨大，所以必须想尽一切方法来提高工作效率，以减少治水和农业生产等等方面的矛盾。在第一期工程中，在组织工作，政治工作，财务和卫生工作，技术工作，以及新旧工具的使用方面，都有很多的经验，需要总结起来，提高一步。再次，第一期工程因为冬季施工只完成全部工程的百分之十五，造成春季施工的仓卒被动，今年必须做好计划准备工作，争取冬季完成更多的工程，以减少春季农忙时节的困难。最后，在今年进行土地改革的地区，必须要把这两大工作，在时间上和人力上做出适当分工与配合，使两个主要任务都能顺利完成。另外，治淮工程，必须与增产节约，支援抗美援朝的运动相结合。第一期工程的经验证明，群众的高涨的革命热情，是克服一切困难的主要因素，我们要继续掌握这个成功的经验，鼓荡起群众的革命的热潮，为完成第二期治淮工程而奋斗。
