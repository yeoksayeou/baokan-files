Sixth Section: Quotation Marks

The Forms of Quotation Marks. There are two forms of quotation marks: single quotation marks (' ') and double quotation marks (" "). Either form can be used, and there is no difference in meaning. Generally, single quotation marks are used more often because they are more convenient and easier to draw. If quotation marks are needed within quotation marks, a different form must be used for clarity. Publishers generally have uniform systems: for example, the People's Daily and the People's Publishing House originally used double quotation marks for general quotations and single quotation marks for quotations within quotations; the People's Education Publishing House uses single quotation marks for general quotations and double quotation marks for quotations within quotations.

(1) The Front Committee said the following in a letter to the Central Committee regarding the Red Army's guerrilla tactics, which included close-range dispersal:
　　"The tactics we have learned from the struggle over the past three years are truly different from the tactics of ancient and modern China and foreign countries... Generally speaking, they are: 'Disperse to mobilize the masses, concentrate to deal with the enemy.'..." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, People's Publishing House)

(2) "Mr. Dreiser, you see, we are just firing these useless guns into the sky!" [The warden's secretary said.]
　　"But with these 'useless guns,' the miner Qi Jialike was killed," Dreiser retorted. (Junior High School Chinese Textbook, People's Education Publishing House)

Using quotation marks within quotation marks is not very convenient, so it is best to avoid it when possible. The following example does not use quotation marks under "broadcast":

(3) He read aloud: "There are many interesting things in life, but I only remember two things... Radio broadcast: News from Canada, the Canadian government bought and destroyed ten million bushels of potatoes to maintain the high price... " (Teaching Material)

If two levels of quotation marks are used, and there is still a need for quotation marks, the third level of quotation marks should be the same as the first. This situation should also be avoided if possible. Some people also misunderstand that single quotation marks are generally used, and when there are quotations within quotations, the outer layer uses double quotation marks and the inner layer uses single quotation marks. This is completely unreasonable and should not be used.

Horizontal books and periodicals also still use ‘’ and “”, but the French and Russian styles of “” are rarely seen.

Quoting, Paraphrasing, Partial Quoting. Quotation marks are used to indicate the parts quoted in the text. There are two ways to quote someone else's words. Writing down someone else's words exactly as they were said is called "quoting," also known as "direct quoting." Generally, quotation marks are used, as in examples (1), (2), and (3) above. Some also do not use quotation marks, such as:

(4) Maybe some people are vaguely saying in their hearts: Are you talking about those "soldiers"? (Newspaper)

(5) After the book is selected, the translator should first ask themselves,
　　Do I have some knowledge of this subject? (Journal)

It is important to note that if quotation marks are not used, it is best to use a colon before it, and not a comma, to avoid misunderstanding as paraphrasing. The above text in (5) determines that there will be no misunderstanding, and using a comma does not matter. But if it is a sentence like this—I asked him, he said, go find it yourself—this "you" may refer to the person who said the sentence, or it may refer to the person listening to the sentence. If a colon is used, it is determined to refer to the person who said the sentence.

Conveying someone else's words, the meaning is theirs, but the words are ours, this is called "paraphrasing," also known as "indirect quoting." This cannot use quotation marks. For example:

(6) People who generally criticize the Farmers' Association say that the Farmers' Association has done many bad things. (Mao)

Sometimes, part of someone else's words is paraphrased, and part is quoted, which can be called "partial quoting." For example:

(7) The "Bergen News" admitted: No matter how fiercely the various reactionary parties oppose communism, "the Communists still hold their ground." (Newspaper)

(8) This situation made the United Press reporter sigh: For Europe's serious economic situation, "the US government cannot come up with any ready-made panaceas." (Newspaper)

The quotation marks in partial quotations should be limited to the quoted part, and the paraphrased part should not be included.

Quoting Existing Phrases. When we write articles, sometimes we use quotation marks to indicate existing phrases, indicating that they are not our own creations and have a source (although the source is not specified). For example:

(9) The Communist Party's propaganda policy for these things should be:
　　"Draw the bow but do not release the arrow, ready to leap forth." (Mao)

(10) It must be until "unfortunately, my words come true," that everyone is silent, but it is too late, and everyone is very sad. (Lu)

(11) Fully realized the spirit of "everyone runs the trade union." (Journal)

Many classical Chinese words were common in classical Chinese and did not require quotation marks. When used in modern Chinese, quotation marks are added. For example:

(12) These people, because they used to live a good life, but declined year by year, became increasingly indebted, and gradually lived a miserable life, "looking to the future, they shudder with cold." (Mao)

(13) He actually does not "indulge in self-pity," but is "smugly complacent." (Lu)

Many idioms are quoted without quotation marks, such as:

(14) The works of ancient and modern authors are enough to fill houses with books, but can we find the works of woodcutters and fishermen? (Lu)

(15) The Bodhisattva wants the peasants to throw them away themselves, and the martyr shrines and chastity arches must be destroyed by the peasants themselves. It is not right for others to do it for them. (Mao)

(16) So that many farmers who used to live on chaff and vegetables for half a year have achieved a life of plenty. (Journal)

Here, "sweat like oxen," "fill houses," "act on behalf of others," and "chaff and vegetables for half a year" are not in quotation marks.

Non-Idioms with Quotation Marks. Sometimes, quotation marks are added before and after a word or phrase, not to indicate that it is an idiom or colloquialism, but simply because it is a specialized term, or a local dialect, or because the reader should pay special attention to it for other reasons. For example:

(17) Master Zhou was talking, but his hands didn't stop, and his eyes were fixed on the "crank." (Teaching Material)

(18) Xiangxiang prohibits "cake banquets" - a not-so-sumptuous banquet. (Mao)

(19) Pictographs... are drawing an eye is "目" (eye), drawing a circle with a few rays of light is "日" (sun). (Lu)

(20) Later, he knew that China could not achieve socialism at present because the industry was too backward, and then he realized how significant "technology" is. (Newspaper)

"Crank" (the handle for turning a machine) is a relatively specialized word, "cake banquet" is a word only used in Xiangxiang, "目" and "日" are only regarded as two characters here, and the reader should pay special attention to "technology" here. All these are in quotation marks.

The use or non-use of this type of quotation mark should be carefully considered. Unnecessarily using too many quotation marks will confuse the reader's attention. For example:

(21) It looks very "simple", but not "naive", giving people a sense of "seriousness". (Work)

On the other hand, there are also examples where quotation marks should be added but are not:

(22) The actor's name has also become a glorious title. (Journal)

The "actor" in this sentence should be in quotation marks, otherwise, as the following text says, it becomes the name of an individual actor. The three words "的的名字" (name of) should be deleted. After deleting them, there will be no misunderstanding, but it is better to add quotation marks to the word "演员" (actor). In the following sentence, "Communist Party member" should be in quotation marks, but "gold-lettered signboard" is not necessary:

(23) Commander-in-Chief Zhu often said: The title of Communist Party member is a "gold-lettered signboard." (Manuscript)

Commander-in-Chief Zhu's words mean that the title "Communist Party member" is glorious, but the author misplaced the quotation marks, turning the nickname of Communist Party members into "gold-lettered signboard."

Metaphor, Doubt, Irony. Some words are in quotation marks because they are used here as a metaphor, or because the author has more or less doubts about the correctness of those words, or even uses them with a bit of irony. For example:

(24) This attitude is the attitude of shooting an arrow at a target. "的" (the) is the Chinese revolution, and "矢" (arrow) is Marxism-Leninism. (Mao)

(25) It is better to have fewer such "theoreticians." (Mao)

(26) From 6:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon, the enemy "counterattacked" more than a dozen times. (Newspaper)

(27) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said: After the US-Japan "Security Treaty" takes effect, "US military ships and military aircraft will be able to use Japanese seaports and air force base facilities at will." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said: These bases are "rented free of charge," but the "construction costs and maintenance costs" of these bases are "shared by the United States and Japan." He also said: As long as the "permission" of the Japanese government is obtained in advance, US troops can be transferred out of their bases for exercises. (Newspaper)

In (24), "的" (the) and "矢" (arrow) are metaphors. In (25), the "theoreticians" only know how to recite books and cannot apply them, and it is doubtful whether they deserve the name "theoreticians." In (26), the "counterattack" and in (27), the "Security Treaty" are obviously ironic. Although the remaining quotation marks in (27) are all quoting the words of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, and therefore should originally be in quotation marks, using paraphrasing in general and only directly quoting these words, it cannot be said that they do not have a sense of irony. The "useless guns" in example (2) are also similar examples.

Proper Nouns, Book Titles, Article Titles. For the convenience of typesetting, most books and periodicals do not use proper noun marks and book title marks. When encountering book and periodical titles, article titles, etc., quotation marks are used to indicate them. This can be said to replace the uppercase letters and font differences in Western languages. For example:

(28) The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," published under the auspices of the Editorial Committee of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong of the CPC Central Committee, the first volume of which has been published by the Beijing People's Publishing House... The works of Comrade Mao Zedong during The First Revolutionary Civil War have been included in this selection: "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." (Newspaper)

(29) The meeting adopted the "Resolution on the Government Work Report and Future Work Guidelines," the "Resolution on Resolutely Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries," and the "Statement on Opposing US Armed Japan." (Newspaper)

In books and periodicals that do not use proper noun marks, general names of people and places are not marked. Other proper nouns sometimes have quotation marks, such as:

(30) As soon as I walked up the stairs of the "China-Soviet Friendship Museum," I looked up and saw the golden bronze sculptures of Lenin and Stalin, the great teachers of the working people of the world. (Journal)

But these types of proper nouns are generally not in quotation marks. In example (28), "Editorial Committee of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "People's Publishing House" are not in quotation marks.

Punctuation Before and After "So-and-so Said". When quoting someone's words, it is common to add a sentence to explain who said it. According to the old method, "So-and-so Said" is placed in front, for example:

(31) Wu Song said, "I also want wine, and cut some more meat." (Teaching Material)

This does not cause any problems. But now we often imitate foreign sayings and put "So-and-so Said" at the end or in the middle. The punctuation of general Western books and periodicals is like this:

(32) "I also want wine, and cut some more meat," Wu Song said.

(33) "I also want wine," Wu Song said, "and cut some more meat."

Now, in the first case, a period is also used, such as:

(34) "I also want wine, and cut some more meat." Wu Song said.

According to the structure of this type of sentence, "So-and-so Said" is the main part of the sentence, and the words inside the quotation marks are the object of "said." When "So-and-so Said" is in front, this relationship is very clear; when it is moved to the bottom, it is still the same, so there is a reason to use a comma. There is also a reason to use a period, because the quotation has ended; "So-and-so Said" is another sentence, as an additional explanation. But using a colon after the word "said" does not make sense. Such as:

(35) "You eat someone else's food, you feel obliged to them." Old Wan said: The colon is used to introduce the following text, but there is nothing following, so what is it introducing?

Putting "So-and-so Said" in the middle, there are also examples of improper punctuation formats:

(36) "Lao Bai, send a few more sentries, this is not a joke." Guo Quanhai said: "The struggle cannot be chaotic..." (Book)

(37) "So," he put the snow in his mouth again, and said like a conclusion, "It doesn't matter if I shed some blood here." (Newspaper)

(38) "Remember, your father was killed by the Japanese," the mother hugged her son tightly and said softly, "You must strive to avenge your father!" (Journal)

The colons under the word "said" in these three sentences are all problematic. The quotation in (36) is divided into two sentences. Putting "Guo Quanhai said:" at the beginning of the second sentence, then who said the first sentence? It was also said by Guo Quanhai. Then, why not explain it at the end of the first sentence, but leave it to be explained at the beginning of the second sentence? If the first sentence is explained, and the second sentence is still this person's words, the reader can easily understand it. The quotation in (37) is divided into two sections, without a break. "He... said:" is in the middle, is it taking care of the first half or the second half? Taking care of the second half, then the first half has no explanation; taking care of the first half, then "so" does not become a paragraph, and a colon indicating a long pause cannot be used after the word "said," but only a comma indicating a short pause, so that "so" and "I" can be connected. The first half of the quotation in (38) can be punctuated. The colon under the word "said" can be changed to a period. If you want to connect it with the second half, you can also use a semicolon here. Only the colon is inappropriate. To sum up, there are two points: First, the role of the colon is to introduce the following text, and it cannot be regarded as the tail of the word "said." Second, when the quotation is divided into two sections, "So-and-so Said" belongs to the above and not the below. The quotation should be read together. What punctuation mark (comma, semicolon, period) should originally be used at the end of the first half of the quotation, move it after the word "said," and use a comma in the original place.

The Order of Quotation Marks and Commas and Periods. Quotation marks are divided into upper and lower parts. The place where the lower quotation mark (') is used is often also where a comma or period should be used, which raises a question: Should the comma or period be placed inside the quotation marks or outside the quotation marks? In principle, the pause of the comma or period and the end of the quotation are simultaneous, and it is best to put these two symbols on the same line. Like some books and periodicals that add commas and periods on the right, there is no problem. But according to the current popular typesetting format, we have to distinguish the order. Abstractly speaking, there are reasons to put the comma or period inside and outside. If the quotation becomes a sentence, it needs to be stopped with a period; if it is half a sentence, it also needs to have a comma or semicolon to indicate a pause. This is the reason to put the comma or period inside the quotation marks. But if this quotation is contained within the author's sentence, then this sentence also needs a comma or period. This is the reason to put the comma or period outside the quotation marks. The usage we see now is very inconsistent, and the formats of books and periodicals in various countries are also very inconsistent. The root cause lies here. (Therefore, some people say that there should be commas and periods inside and outside the quotation marks, but this is very ugly and unnecessary.) The "Usage of Punctuation Marks" drafted by the General Administration of Publications has an explanation on this point: "All complete verbatim quotations of other people's words should have the ending symbol inside the quotation marks. All quotations used as part of the author's sentence should have the ending symbol outside the quotation marks." This principle is very reasonable, but in specific applications, there are still some situations that are not easy to decide or are prone to errors. Let's find some examples to see:

(39) In the fertile soil of ethnic literature and art in New China, we have begun to see the "bright and iron-like new flower" that Lu Xun earnestly hoped for eighteen years ago. (Newspaper)

"Bright and iron-like new flower" does not become a sentence or half a sentence, and does not need a comma or period in itself. The period should definitely be placed outside the quotation marks.

(40) Several district people's governments in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, have arbitrarily stipulated the principle of bringing property is: "Women who file for divorce do not bring; men who file for divorce can bring." (Newspaper)

Here, the words inside the quotation marks are complete, and the period should be placed inside the quotation marks. But if the colon before the quotation marks is removed, the quotation becomes part of the author's sentence, and the period should be placed outside. It can be seen that whether the quotation can be regarded as a complete sentence or not is related to whether a colon is used before it.

(41) The declaration stated that "all countries should jointly fight against the barbarous and beastly forces that attempt to conquer the world," and specifically pointed out: "Each government undertakes to cooperate with the signatory countries of this declaration and not to conclude separate armistice agreements and peace treaties with the enemy countries." (Newspaper)

(42) The letter despairingly said: The invading French army is "in danger, even in great danger." The French army "cannot possibly spend another winter here in terms of physical strength." After nine months of "nervous tension," the spirit is also "largely impossible to spend another winter." This soldier said, "We have also been in Indochina, but it is not as terrible as the situation here." (Newspaper)

The format of these two examples fully complies with the principles mentioned above. However, taking (41) as an example, if a colon is not used under "pointed out," the period under "peace treaty" should of course be placed outside the quotation marks. If a colon is used under "declaration," should the comma under "fight" be placed inside the quotation marks? Or should it be placed inside the quotation marks and changed to a period? (42) illustrates another situation: if the colon is not entirely a quotation (that is, the "partial quotation" mentioned earlier), such as the four words "侵朝法军" (invading French army) here are not included in the quotation, the period is still placed outside the quotation marks. But this place is easily mistaken.

(43) The newspaper said: "It is very reasonable to accept the 38th parallel as the dividing line." The newspaper also said: The US side "continues to fight on the battlefield and at the conference table for a few miles of land that it does not actually intend to keep is somewhat incomprehensible." The newspaper advocated "immediately declaring its willingness to recognize the 38th parallel as the north-south dividing line and seek a political solution." (Newspaper)

(44) The British Manchester Guardian admitted in an editorial on April 3 that "the real danger in Dulles's policy is that it may prove that the Asian policy adopted by the United States is mainly and obviously based on military considerations." "The US policy towards Japan is less out of generosity than out of the need to obtain an ally." (Newspaper)

The first sentence in (43) uses a colon, and the period is inside the quotation marks; the third sentence does not use a colon, and the period is outside the quotation marks, which are all in line with the principles. The second sentence is the same as the first sentence in (42), but the period is placed inside the quotation marks, which is a mistake in the above colon. The period in the first sentence of (44) is correct, but the second sentence has been separated from the previous "admitted," and the period should be placed inside the quotation marks.

(45) The reactionary leader of the US Republican Party, Hoover, publicly admitted in a radio speech he delivered on December 20 last year that, due to the strength of the Soviet Union, "any attempt to wage war against the communist continent is pure stupidity. That would be the tomb of millions of American boys... Even if Western Europe is armed far beyond any proposed plan, we will never reach Moscow." (Newspaper)

(46) Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the land reform issue that this extremely unreasonable feudal land ownership system is "the root cause of our nation's aggression, oppression, poverty, and backwardness, and the basic obstacle to our country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unity, and prosperity. If this situation is not changed, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution cannot be consolidated, rural productivity cannot be liberated, the industrialization of New China will not be possible, and the people will not be able to obtain the basic fruits of the revolutionary victory." (Journal)

These two examples illustrate another situation. The words quoted here are all caused halfway, that is, "partial quoting," and the ending period should originally be placed outside the quotation marks. However, there is already a period inside the quotation marks, so (45) puts the ending period inside the quotation marks. (46) still puts it outside the quotation marks. Which format is better? I am afraid (45) is better.

(47) "Three cobblers, one Zhuge Liang," they get together to discuss whenever they have time. After half a month, they actually came up with a solution. (Journal)

The quotation in this sentence is complete in itself, which is different from "partial quoting," but the quotation ends and the sentence is not over, and the author's words continue. Should the comma here be placed inside the quotation marks or outside? In this case, the principles cited earlier cannot help us quickly decide. Referring to examples (32) and (33), this comma can be placed inside. Referring to example (12), this comma seems to be placed outside. (47) has the comma outside, but it is also often seen with the comma inside. (Even in this talk, we are not very consistent.)

(48) All this made the peasant representatives strongly feel that "the city has changed," "the relationship between urban and rural people has changed," and "the world has truly become the people's." (Newspaper)

The three quotations here are also complete in themselves, but when connected under "feel," the commas and periods can only be placed outside. If exclamation points are added to these three quotations, they must be placed inside the quotation marks.

It is impossible to list all the possible situations that may be encountered here. If readers can understand the spirit of the explanation in the "Usage of Punctuation Marks" quoted earlier, and refer to some of the examples cited here, there may not be too many remaining difficult situations. Fortunately, although this problem is not simple, in reality, a slight error will not affect the understanding of the meaning. (End of this section, end of full text.)

    语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
  　吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第六段引号
    引号的形式。引号有单引号（‘’）和双引号（“”）两种。用哪一种形式都可以，没有意义上的分别。一般是用单引号的居多，为的是方便，画单线比画双线省事些。如果引号里头还要用引号，就得用另外一种，看起来才清楚。出版家大抵各有划一的制度：像人民日报和人民出版社原先都是一般引文用双引号，引文里的引文用单引号；人民教育出版社就是一般引文用单引号，引文里的引文用双引号。
    （一）前委给中央的信上说了红军的游击战术，那里面包括了近距离的分兵：
    “我们三年来从斗争中所得的战术，真是和古今中外的战术都不同。………大要说来是：‘分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人。’………”（毛泽东选集，人民出版社）
    （二）“德莱赛先生，你看，我们只不过用这种没有用处的枪朝天放放罢了！”【典狱官的秘书说。】
     “可是，用这种‘没有用处的枪’居然打死了那个矿工齐迦里克，”德莱赛反驳他们。（初中语文课本，人民教育出版社）引号里面用引号，究竟不很方便，能不用的时候最好不用。下面这个例子就没有在“广播”底下用引号：
    （三）他高声读出来：“有趣味的生活是非常多的，但是我只记下两件事情。……无线电广播：加拿大消息，加拿大政府为了保持马铃薯的高价，收买了一千万布舍里来毁掉了。………”（教）
    如果用了两道引号，还有用引号的必要，第三道引号的形式跟第一道相同。这种情形，能够避免自然更应该避免。还有人有一种误会：一般用单引号，到了引中有引的时候，外层用双引号，里层用单引号。这是完全不合理的，不能这样用。
    横行的书刊，也有还用‘’和“”的，但是多数是用英文式的‘’和“”，法文和俄文式的“”还不大看见。
    引述、转述、局部引述。引号是用来表示文中引用的部分的。引用别人的话有两种方式。把别人的话照原来的样子写下来的叫“引述”，又叫“直接引”。一般都用引号，如前面（一）（二）（三）例。也有不用引号的，如：
    （四）也许有的人在心里隐隐约约地说：你说的就是那些“兵”吗？（报）
    （五）书选定之后，翻译者应当首先问问自己，
        我是否对于这种学科有些修养呢？（期）要注意的是：如果不用引号，前面最好用冒号，不要用逗号，免得误会是转述。（五）的上文下决定它不会有误解，用了逗号不妨事，如果是这样一句——我问了他，他说，你自己去找吧——这个“你”就可能指说这句话的人，也可能指听这句话的人。要是用了冒号，就确定是指说这句话的人了。
    传达别人的话，意思是他的，字句是我们的，这叫“转述”，又叫“间接引”。这是不能用引号的。例如：
    （六）一般指摘农会的人说农会做了许多坏事。（毛）
    有时候，引用别人的话，一半是转述，一半是引述，这可以称为“局部引述”。例如：
    （七）“卑尔根报”就承认：不论各反动党派如何猛烈地反共，“共产党人仍然守住了自己的阵地”。（报）
    （八）这种情况使合众社记者也只有叹息：对于欧洲的严重的经济情况，“美国政府拿不出什么现成的万灵药来”。（报）局部引述的引号应该限制在引述的部分，不能把转述的部分也放进去。
    引用现成语句。我们写文章，有时候引用现成的语句，也用引号标明，表示不是我们杜撰的，是有出处的（虽然出处没有说明）。例如：
    （九）共产党对于这些东西的宣传政策应当是：
    “引而不发，跃如也。”（毛）
     （十）一定要到得“不幸而吾言中”，这才大家默默无言，然而为时已晚，是彼此都大可悲哀的。（鲁）
    （十一）充分实现了“大家办工会”的精神。（期）许多文言词语，在文言文里是普通的，无需用引号，用在现代文里就都加上了引号。例如：
    （十二）这种人因为他们过去过着好日子，后来逐年下降，负债渐多，渐次过着凄凉的日子，“瞻念前途，不寒而栗”。（毛）
    （十三）他其实并不“顾影自怜”，倒在“沾沾
        自喜”。（鲁）引用成语而不用引号的也很多，例如：
    （十四）古今作者，足以汗牛而充栋，但我们可能找出樵夫渔父的著作来？（鲁）
    （十五）菩萨要农民自己去丢，烈女祠、节孝坊要农民自己去摧毁，别人代庖是不对的。（毛）
    （十六）使许多从前糠菜半年粮的农民因而得到了丰衣足食。（期）这里的“汗牛”“充栋”“代庖”“糠菜半年粮”就都没有加引号。
    非成语加引号。有时候在一个词语的前后加引号，并不表示这是成语或熟语，而只是因为它是个专门术语，或是一地方言，或是因为其他理由要读者特别注意。例如：
    （十七）周师傅嘴里说着话，手里还是不闲着，眼睛盯着“摇把”。（教）
    （十八）湘乡禁止“蛋糕席”——一种并不丰盛的席面。（毛）
    （十九）象形……就是画一只眼睛是“目”，画一个圆圈，放几条毫光是“日”。（鲁）
    （二十）以后他知道中国目前不能实现社会主义，是因为工业太落后了，这才了解到“技术”这东西该有多大意义。（报）“摇把”（转动机器的把柄）是个比较专门的词儿，“蛋糕席”是只通行于湘乡一地的词儿，“目”和“日”在这里只作为两个字看，“技术”在这里要读者特别注意。诸如此类，都加引号。
    这一类的引号的用与不用要好好考虑。不必要地多用引号反而搅乱读者的注意，例如：
    （二一）看上去，很“朴实”，然而不“幼稚”，给人以一种“严肃”之感。（作）另一方面也有该加引号而不加的例子：
    （二二）演员的名字也成了光荣的称号。（期）这一句“演员”该加引号，否则连下文讲，变成个别的演员的名字了。“的名字”三个字应删，删去以后不至于有误会，但是“演员”二字还是加上引号好些。下面这一句里，“共产党员”应该加引号，“金字招牌”倒不必：
    （二三）朱总司令常说：共产党员的称号是“金字招牌”。（稿）朱总司令这句话的意思是“共产党员”这个称号是光荣的，可是作者把引号放错了地方，变成共产党员的外号是“金字招牌”了。
    借譬、怀疑、讽刺。有些词语的加引号是因为在这里是借譬，或是因为作者对于那些词语的正确性有或多或少的怀疑，甚至是带点讽刺来使用的。例如：
    （二四）这种态度，就是有的放矢的态度。“的”就是中国革命，“矢”就是马列主义。（毛）
    （二五）这样的“理论家”实在还是少一点好。（毛）
    （二六）从上午六时半到十二时，敌人“反击”十几次。（报）
    （二七）该外务省官员说：美日“安全条约”生效以后，“美国的军用舰只和军用飞机将可随意使用日本的海港和空军基地设备”。该外务省官员说：这些基地是“免费出租的”，但这些基地的“建设费和维持费”则是由美日“两国分担”。他又说：只要事先得到了日本政府的“允许”，美国部队可以调出他们的基地，进行演习。（报）
    （二四）的“的”和“矢”是借譬。（二五）的“理论家”只知道背诵书本，不会应用，是否当得起“理论家”之名大可怀疑。（二六）的“反击”和（二七）的“安全条约”显然是讽刺性的。（二七）其余的引号虽然都是引述该外务省官员的话，因此本来应该加引号，但一般用转述而单单提出这些词语来直接引述，也不能不说是带有讽刺的意思。例（二）的“没有用处的枪”也是同类的例子。
    专名、书名、篇名。为了排印的方便，多数书刊不用专名号和书名号，遇到书刊名、篇名之类，都用引号标明。这可以说是代替西文里的大写和字体上的区别的。例如：
    （二八）由中共中央毛泽东选集出版委员会主持出版的“毛泽东选集”，其第一卷已由北京人民出版社出版……毛泽东同志在第一次国内革命战争时期的著作，本选集编进两篇：“中国社会各阶级的分析”与“湖南农民运动考察报告”。（报）
    （二九）会议通过“关于政府工作报告和今后工作方针的决议”、“关于坚决镇压反革命的决议”和“关于反对美国武装日本的声明”。（报）在不用专名号的书刊里，一般人名、地名是不加符号的。其他的专名有时候加引号，如：
    （三十）刚一走上“中苏友谊馆”的楼梯，一抬 头就看到世界劳动人民的伟大导师列宁和斯大林的金色铜雕。（期）但这类专名一般也是不加引号的。（二八）例的“毛泽东选集出版委员会”和“人民出版社”，就都没有加引号。
    “某某说”前后的标点。在引人家的话的时候，常常要交代一句，这是谁说的。照过去的老办法，把“某某说”放在前面，例如：
    （三一）武松道：“我也要酒，也再切些肉来。”（教）这就不发生什么问题。可是我们现在又常常模仿外国说法，把“某某说”放在后面或是插在中间。一般西文书刊的标点是这样的：
    （三二）“我也要酒，也再切些肉来，”武松道。
    （三三）“我也要酒，”武松道，“也再切些肉来。”现在也有在第一种情形用句号的，如：
    （三四）“我也要酒，也再切些肉来。”武松道。按这类句子的结构，“某某说”是句子的主要部分，引号里面的话是“说”的宾语。“某某说”在前，这个关系很明显；搬到底下，还是一样，所以用逗号是有理由的。用句号也有理由，因为引文已经完了；“某某说”另作一句，作为追加说明。可是在“说”字后面用冒号，那就讲不通了。如：
    （三五）“吃人家的嘴软。”老万说：冒号是引起下文的，下文什么都没有了，还“冒”个什么？
    把“某某说”插在中间，标点格式也有欠妥的例子：
    （三六）“老白，多派几个哨，可不是闹着玩的。”郭全海说：“斗争来不能叫乱套………”（书）
    （三七）“所以，”他又把雪放到嘴里，像总结似地说：“我在这里流点血不算什么。”（报）
    （三八）“记住，你父亲是日本人杀死的，”母亲紧紧抱住儿子低低地说：“你们要争气，要替你父亲报仇！”（期）这三句的“说”字底下的冒号都有问题。（三六）的引文分两句，把“郭全海说：”搁在第二句的头上，那末头一句是谁说的呢？也是郭全海说的。那末，为什么不在头一句的末了交代，要留到第二句的头上交代呢？第一句交代了，第二句还是这个人的话，读者倒是容易意会的。（三七）的引文分两截，没有断句。“他………说：”在中间，算是照顾上半截的呢还是照顾下半截的？照顾下半截，则上半截无交代；照顾上半截，则“所以”不成段落，“说”字后面就不能用表示大停顿的冒号，只能用表示小停顿的逗号，“所以”和“我”才接得上。（三八）的引文上半截是可以断句的，“说”字底下的冒号可以改做句号。如果要跟下半截联成一句，这里也可以用分号。就只冒号不妥。总结起来有两点：一，冒号的作用是引起下文，不能把它当作“说”字的尾巴。二，引文分两截的时候，“某某说”属上不属下。引文要连起来看，前半截引文末了原来应该用什么标点符号（逗号，分号，句号），就把它移在“说”字之后，在原来的地方用个逗号。
    引号和句逗号的先后。引号分上下两部分。用下引号（’）的地方往往也是该用句逗号的地方，这就引起一个问题：句逗号放在引号之内还是引号之外？照道理讲，句逗的停顿和引文的终止是同时的，这两种符号最好放在一条线上。像有些书刊把句逗号加在右边，也就没有问题。但照现在通行的排印格式，就不得不分先后。抽象地说，句逗号在内和在外，都有理由可说。引文如果成为一句话，它本身需要用句号煞住；如果是半句话，也需要有逗号或分号表示停顿。这是把句逗号放在引号之内的理由。可是如果这个引文被包含在作者的语句之内，那么这个语句也是需要有句逗号的。这是把句逗号放在引号之外的理由。现在所见的用法很不一致，参考各国书刊的格式，也很不一致，根本原因在此。（因此有人说，引号内外应该各有句逗号，但这是非常难看也无必要的。）出版总署拟订的“标点符号用法”里关于这一点有说明：“凡是完整的照录他人的话，末了儿的符号在引号之内。凡是把引用的话作为作者一句话的一部分，末了儿的符号在引号之外。”这个原则是很合理的，可是具体应用起来，也还有些不容易决断或容易有出入的情形。让我们找些实例来看看：
    （三九）在新中国民族文艺肥沃的土壤里，我们已开始看见鲁迅在十八年前所殷切企望的“鲜艳而铁一般的新花。”（报）“鲜艳而铁一般的新花”不成为一句话或半句话，本身不需要句逗号，句号绝对应该放在引号之外。
    （四十）山西榆次县好几个区人民政府竟擅自规定了带财产的原则是：“女的提出离婚者不带；男的提出离婚者可以带”。（报）这里引号里面的话是完整的，句号应该放在引号之内。可是如果把引号前面的冒号取消，引文就变了作者的句子的一部分，句号放在外面就对了。可见引文能不能算是一句完整的话，跟前面用不用冒号有关系。
    （四一）宣言声明“各国对企图征服世界之野蛮与兽性之武力，从事共同奋斗”，并特别指出：“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定与和约。”（报）
    （四二）信中绝望地说：侵略法军“本身在危险之中，甚至在很大的危险之中”。法军“在体力方面是不可能再在此地度过一个冬天了”。在九个月的“神经紧张”状态之后，精神方面也“大致不可能再度过一个冬天”。这个兵士说：“我们在印度支那也混过，但却不像这里的情形那么可怕。”（报）这两个例子的格式完全符合前面所说的原则。可是，以（四一）而论，如果“指出”底下不用冒号，“和约”底下的句号当然要放在引号之外。如果“声明”底下用冒号，“奋斗”底下的逗号是否要放在引号之内呢？还是放在引号之内而改用句号呢？（四二）又说明另一种情形：冒号之下如果不是全部是引文（即前面所说“局部引述”），像这里有“侵朝法军”四字不包括在引文之内，句号也还是放在引号之外。但是这种地方很容易弄错。
    （四三）该报称：“接受三八线为分界线是很合理的。”该报又称：美国方面“继续在战场上和会议桌上，为了实际上以后并不打算保持的几哩土地而争斗，是有一些说不通的。”该报主张“立即宣布愿意承认三八线为南北分界线而谋求政治解决”。（报）
    （四四）英国曼彻斯特卫报四月三日在社论中承认“杜勒斯政策中的真正危险是：它可能证实美国所采取的亚洲政策，主要而且显然是以军事上的考虑为根据的”。“美国的对日政策，与其说是出于宽大，还不如说是出于需要获得一个同盟国”。（报）
    （四三）第一句用冒号，句号在引号之内；第三句不用冒号，句号在引号之外，都合于原则。第二句跟（四二）第一句情形相同，但是句号放在引号之内，这就是误于上面的冒号了。（四四）第一句的句号在外是对的，但是第二句已经跟前面的“承认”隔断，句号就应该放在引号之内了。
    （四五）美国共和党的反动头子胡佛在去年十二月二十日所发表的广播演说中，就曾公开供认，由于苏联的强大，“对共产主义大陆进行战争的任何企图都是纯然的蠢事。那将是数百万美国男儿的坟墓……即使把西欧远超过任何拟议中的计划而武装起来，我们也永远到达不了莫斯科。”（报）
    （四六）刘少奇副主席在土地改革问题的报告中指出：这种极不合理的封建土地所有制，是“我们民族被侵略、被压迫、穷困及落后的根源，是我们国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的基本障碍。这种情况如不加改变，中国人民革命的胜利就不能巩固，农村生产力就不能解放，新中国工业化就没有实现的可能，人民就得不到革命胜利的基本的果实”。（期）这两个例子说明另外一种情形。这里引用的话都是半路上引起的，即“局部引述”，末了的句号本来应该放在引号之外。但是引文内部已有句号，（四五）就把末了的句号放在引号之内。（四六）仍然放在引号之外。哪一种格式好些呢？恐怕（四五）好些。
    （四七）“三个臭皮匠，一个诸葛亮”，他们有空就凑在一块儿讨论，过了半个月，居然想出个办法来。（期）这一句里的引文，本身是完整的，跟“局部引述”不同，但是引文终了而句子未了，接下去还有作者的话。这里的逗号该放在引号里面呢，还是外面？像这种情形，前面所引的原则就不能帮助我们很快地决定。参照（三二）和（三三）例，这个逗号可以放在里面。参照（十二）例，这个逗号又似乎应该放在外面。（四七）是逗号在外的，但逗号在里的也常常看见。（我们这个讲话里面也就不很一律。）
    （四八）这一切，都使农民代表强烈地感觉到“城市变了”，“城里人和乡里人的关系变了”，“世界真正成了人民的了”。（报）这里的三句引文，本身也都是完整的，但是连在“感觉到”的底下，就只能把句逗号放在外面。假如这三句引文都加上叹号，那又非放在引号里面不可了。
    要把各种可能遇见的情形都在这里列举出来，那是不可能的。读者如能体会前面所引的“标点符号用法”里的说明的精神，再参考这里所举的一些例子，剩下来的疑难情形也许不会太多。好在这个问题虽然不简单，实际上稍微有点出入并不至于影响意义的了解。（本段完，全文未完）
