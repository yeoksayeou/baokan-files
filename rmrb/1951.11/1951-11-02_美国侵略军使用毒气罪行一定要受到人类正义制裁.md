International Short Commentary

　　The U.S. aggressor troops used long-range artillery to launch more than 20 poison gas shells at our army positions near Tieyuan, Korea, on October 4th. This is the fifth serious crime committed by the U.S. aggressor troops against our army since February of this year, using poison gas under the situation of military defeat. With its actions that completely disregard international law and violate humanitarian principles, the U.S. aggressor troops have once again proven to the people of the world that American imperialism is the most ferocious and brutal aggressor in the world, just like the German and Japanese fascists.
    Here, it must be seriously pointed out that the U.S. aggressor troops' crime of using poison gas this time occurred during the period when the Korean armistice negotiations were beginning to resume, and therefore it is bound to be subject to more severe condemnation by peace-loving people all over the world.
    The U.S. aggressor troops have repeatedly used poison gas in the war, and their purpose is nothing more than to attempt to use this barbaric killing weapon to save their defeat and facilitate continued adventurous aggression. However, the shameful plot of American imperialism cannot be realized. No so-called "air" and "sea" superiority and any illegal and barbaric killing weapons can save it from its inevitable defeat. The more American imperialism adopts various brutal and barbaric despicable means, the more it exposes its dying struggle and further arouses the anger and resistance of the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    The barbaric atrocities of the U.S. aggressor troops are bound to be sanctioned by the justice of all peaceful mankind.

### 美国侵略军使用毒气罪行一定要受到人类正义制裁

　　美国侵略军使用毒气罪行一定要受到人类正义制裁
    美国侵略军于十月四日曾在朝鲜铁原附近以远射程炮向我军阵地发射毒气炮弹二十余枚。这是美国侵略军队在遭受军事失利的形势之下，自今年二月以来第五次向我军施放毒气的严重罪行。美国侵略军队以它完全无视国际公法与违反人道原则的行动，再一次地向全世界人民证明了：美帝国主义与德日法西斯一样是世界上最凶恶最残暴的侵略者。
    在这里，必须严重指出：美国侵略军队这次使用毒气的罪行，是在朝鲜停战谈判开始恢复的期间，因而它就必然要受到世界爱好和平人民更为严厉的斥责。
    美国侵略军队在战争中一再使用毒气，其目的无非是妄图以这种野蛮的杀人武器来挽救它的失败，而便于继续冒险进犯。但是美帝国主义的可耻图谋是无法实现的。任何所谓“空中”与“海上”的优势和任何非法野蛮的杀人武器，都挽救不了它已经注定的必然的失败。美帝国主义愈采取各种残暴野蛮的卑劣手段，就愈暴露它的垂死挣扎的面目，而更加激起中国人民与全世界人民的愤怒和反抗。
    美国侵略军队的野蛮兽行，是一定要受到全体和平人类的正义制裁的。
