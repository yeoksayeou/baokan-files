    Dongfang Limin's Self-Criticism

    I wasn't familiar with the Zhonghua Book Company at first, but after several buying and selling transactions, I gradually became acquainted with them. The store had warehouses, and many rooms, making it very convenient for storing things and coming and going. So, when I came to Beijing, I often stayed there. Sometimes the store's counter would invite me to eat when they had meals, and I would go with them to see plays or take baths in the evenings. At the time, I didn't pay attention to the negative impact of this behavior. After this self-examination, I realized that this behavior was wrong. For myself, being gluttonous and greedy, casually accepting other people's hospitality, would, over time, corrupt me and gradually erode my revolutionary qualities. Although I have been working for a long time, some old habits still remain in certain areas. If I do not remain vigilant against this kind of behavior and do not make a profound self-criticism, it will become a serious obstacle to my progress. I will never make such mistakes again. I will study hard, transform myself, and, under the Party's cultivation and education, serve the people well.

    东方立民的检讨
    我原来与中华书局并不熟，经过几次买卖关系，才渐渐熟识了。该店有货栈，房屋又多，存放东西，来往都很方便，所以我到北京的时候时常住在那里。有时候该店柜上开饭就招呼我去吃，晚上他们看戏或洗澡，我也随着去。当时我并未注意这种行为的不良影响。经过这次检查以后，我认识到这种行为是错误的。对我自己来说，自己贪吃贪喝，随便受人家的招待，日子长了就会腐化起来，逐渐丧失革命的品质。自己虽然参加工作很久，但在某些地方仍然残存着一些旧的习气。如果对这种行为不加警惕，不做深刻检讨，它将会成为自己前进的严重障碍。以后我绝不再犯这样的错误。我要努力学习，改造自己，在党的培养教育下，好好为人民服务。　东方立民
