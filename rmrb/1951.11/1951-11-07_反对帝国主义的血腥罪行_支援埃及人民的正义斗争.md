    Oppose the Bloody Crimes of Imperialism
    Support the Just Struggle of the Egyptian People
    When I read in the newspaper about the British imperialists' bloody suppression of the Egyptian people, my heart was filled with boundless indignation. We must resolutely protest against the British imperialists who are slaughtering the Egyptian people. We must warn the British government authorities that this is no longer an era when imperialists can arbitrarily slaughter and devastate people as they did in the past. We, the entire Chinese people, fully sympathize with the just struggle of the Egyptian people and demand that British imperialism immediately cease its atrocities, immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory, and allow the Egyptian people to obtain independence and freedom.

    Use Our Victory to Encourage the Struggle of the Egyptian People
    Recently, the struggle of the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people against imperialism is flourishing. Students are very concerned about this struggle and its development. Many people are writing letters to Egyptian students and the Egyptian people, expressing their sympathy and support for them. Everyone also clearly realizes that the great victory of our Resist America, Aid Korea movement has given the people of colonial and dependent countries infinite confidence in their anti-imperialist struggle, making them realize that imperialism is a defanged beast that cannot withstand struggle. In the future, we must work harder to support the Volunteer Army in winning battles. Our victory will inspire and promote more people in colonial countries to rise up in struggle and spread the flames of anger against imperialism all over the world.

    The Just Struggle of the Egyptian People Will Surely Be Victorious
    The Chinese people fully understand and sympathize with the plight of the Egyptian people and support their just demands. We hope that the Egyptian people will unite more closely and wage a persistent struggle against British imperialism. Historical facts tell us that with the support of peace-loving people all over the world and the continuous struggle of the Egyptian people, the Egyptian people will surely achieve final victory and obtain their national independence and national sovereignty.

    反对帝国主义的血腥罪行
    支援埃及人民的正义斗争
    我在报上看到英帝国主义血腥镇压埃及人民的消息，心里充满了无比的愤慨。我们要向屠杀埃及人民的英帝国主义坚决抗议。我们要警告英国政府当局，现在已经不是像过去那样帝国主义可以任意屠杀任意摧残人民的时代了。我们全中国人民完全同情埃及人民的正义斗争，要求英帝国主义立即停止暴行，立即退出埃及国土，让埃及人民得到独立与自由。

    用我们的胜利来鼓舞埃及人民的斗争
    最近埃及和中东人民反对帝国主义的斗争正在蓬勃展开，同学们对于这一斗争和它的发展都很关心，许多人都给埃及学生和埃及人民写信，表示对他们的同情和支持。大家并且清楚地认识到：我们抗美援朝运动的伟大胜利，使殖民地附属国人民的反帝斗争增加了无限的信心，使他们认识到帝国主义是脱了毛的野兽，是经不起斗争的。今后我们更要努力支援志愿军打胜仗，我们的胜利将会激励与推动更多的殖民地国家人民起来斗争，把反对帝国主义的怒火燃遍全世界。

    埃及人民的正义斗争一定胜利
    中国人民完全了解和同情埃及人民的遭遇，并且支持他们的正义要求。我们希望埃及人民更紧密地团结起来，向英帝国主义作坚持的斗争。历史的事实告诉我们，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下与埃及人民的不断斗争下，埃及人民一定会得到最后的胜利，得到他们的民族独立与国家主权。
