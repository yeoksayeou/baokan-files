An Account of the People's Liberation Army Entering Lhasa
    Written collectively by Xinhua News Agency reporters
    More than a month after the advance troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered Tibet and stationed in Lhasa, the main force of the PLA, led by Commander Zhang Guohua and Political Commissar Tan Guansan, victoriously arrived in Lhasa on October 26th. The clergy and laity of Lhasa welcomed all the officers and soldiers of the PLA troops with gratitude. For more than a month, the impression of the PLA soldiers on the clergy and laity has been: amiable and kind, strictly observing customs and discipline.
    Early that day, crowds of clergy and laity swarmed to the meeting place. Farmers and herdsmen from ten or twenty miles away also came to Lhasa in new clothes. Many merchants voluntarily closed their businesses and went out to participate in the welcome meeting. A Tibetan woman named Chidan Zhu, carrying one child on her back and holding another by the hand, hurried towards the meeting place. She said happily, "My husband is also here, all four of us are here to participate in the welcome meeting."
    At noon, the October sun warmly shone on the bustling crowd outside Lhasa. Five-star red flags fluttered in the wind around the meeting place, and the golden banner with the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet shone brightly. Huge and clear slogans such as "Resolutely Implement the Peaceful Agreement, Build Tibet, and Consolidate National Defense" were dazzling. Soon, the bright red flag of the PLA appeared in front, and majestic songs rang out, and the crowd immediately boiled over. Tibetan local government officials in red and yellow brocade robes greeted them in front of the welcome shed, and representatives of the Han and Hui ethnic groups waited on the roadside with flowers. When Generals Zhang Guohua and Tan Guansan arrived, Tibetan local government officials presented Hada scarves, and representatives of the Han and Hui ethnic groups presented flowers. Then, General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, General Zhang Guohua, commander of the PLA troops entering Tibet, Political Commissar Tan Guansan, and others, as well as the six Kalons and Acting Kalons of the Tibetan local government, inspected the PLA troops entering Tibet and the Tibetan local troops stationed in Lhasa on the outskirts. After more than two months of continuous marching, traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, and enduring wind and snow, the soldiers were all full of energy and marched past the review stand in a neat and majestic manner. When the Tibetan clergy and laity saw the rows of new light and heavy weapons and the soldiers marching heroically, they showed infinite excitement and joy. They simply couldn't believe that this was the army that had just trekked through thousands of mountains and rivers. When the PLA troops marched towards the venue holding horizontal banners with "Extend Cordial Greetings to Tibetan Compatriots" and "Celebrate the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the welcoming masses in the venue surged, vying to see the PLA. The welcoming masses happily echoed the soldiers' songs and listened to the speeches of the leaders on the stage. The PLA propagandists were surrounded by the masses. People scrambled for propaganda materials and Chairman Mao's portraits. An elderly Tibetan woman named Chayi, 68 years old, said to a propagandist: "Give me a portrait of Chairman Mao, I want to take it back and hang it in the cleanest place." When she said the latter sentence, she put her hands together and raised them high.
    In the crowd-lined streets, the PLA troops held a solemn entry ceremony. The military band, the five-star red flag team, the procession holding portraits of leaders, the waist drum team, the blue flag team writing the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and the neat and majestic team stretched from the east of Lhasa city to the west of the city. Lhasa city has never been so lively as today. Many lamas and merchants recited the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and some even took out pens to write the articles in their notebooks.
    The soldiers who participated in the city entry ceremony were deeply moved by the warm welcome of the Tibetan people. They expressed their determination to resolutely implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and consolidate national defense.

　　记人民解放军进藏部队进入拉萨
    新华社记者集体写作
    人民解放军进藏先遣部队进驻拉萨一个多月后，进藏部队在司令员张国华、政治委员谭冠三两将军率领下，在十月二十六日胜利地到达拉萨。拉萨僧俗人民满怀感激之情来欢迎进藏部队的全体指战员们。一个多月来，僧俗人民对人民解放军战士们的印象是：和蔼可亲，严格地遵守风俗习惯和纪律。
    这天一早，成群的僧俗人民就涌向会场。一二十里外的农、牧民也穿着新衣赶到拉萨来。许多商人都自动停业，全体出动去参加欢迎大会。一个叫赤丹珠的藏族妇女，身背一个小孩，手拉一个小孩，急急忙忙走向会场。她高兴地说：“我的丈夫也来了，全家四口人都出来参加欢迎会了。”
    中午，十月的太阳暖和地照耀着拉萨郊外熙熙攘攘的欢迎人群。会场四周五星红旗迎风招展，写着和平解放西藏办法的协议的金字大旗灿烂耀眼，“坚决实现和平协议，建设西藏，巩固国防”等巨幅鲜明标语光辉夺目。不久，前面出现了人民解放军的鲜红的旗帜，响起了雄壮的歌声，人群立刻沸腾起来。身穿红黄锦袍的西藏地方政府官员们迎候在欢迎棚前，汉回民族代表拿着鲜花等在路旁。当张国华、谭冠三两将军来到时，西藏地方政府官员们献了哈达，汉回民族代表献上鲜花。接着，中央人民政府代表张经武将军、进藏部队司令员张国华将军、政治委员谭冠三将军等，以及西藏地方政府六位噶伦和代理噶伦在郊外检阅进藏部队和驻拉萨的西藏地方部队。经过两个多月连续行军，翻越了千山万水，饱经风雪的战士们，个个精神饱满，整齐雄壮地通过检阅台前。西藏僧俗人民看到一列列新式轻重武器，和战士们雄赳赳地走过时，都表现无限的兴奋和喜悦，他们简直不相信这就是刚刚跋涉过千山万水的军队。当进藏部队高举着“向藏族同胞致以亲切慰问”、“庆祝西藏和平解放”的横旗走向会场时，场内欢迎群众万头攒动，纷纷争看解放军。欢迎群众欢乐地应和着战士们的歌声，倾听着台上首长们的讲话。解放军的宣传员被群众包围着。人们争着要宣传品和毛主席的画像。一位名叫察依的六十八岁藏族老妇向宣传员说：“给我一张毛主席的画像吧，我要拿回去挂在最干净的地方。”她说到后一句话时双手合掌高举起来。
    在人群夹道中，进藏部队举行了庄严的入城式，军乐队、五星红旗队、举着领袖像的行列、腰鼓队、写着和平解放西藏办法的协议的蓝旗队和整齐雄壮的队伍从拉萨城东延伸到城西，拉萨城从来没有像今天这样热闹过。许多喇嘛和商人念着和平解放西藏办法的协议，有人还拿出笔来把条文记在本子上。
    参加过入城式的战士们深深为藏族人民的热情欢迎所感动。他们纷纷表示：坚决执行和平解放西藏办法的协议，巩固国防。
