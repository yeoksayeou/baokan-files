To the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association:

    On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution of our great ally, the Soviet Union, we extend our warm congratulations to the Soviet people. For the sake of our motherland's security, for the sake of lasting peace in the Far East and the world, and for the just cause of people's democracy, the Chinese people, based on the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, must unite even more closely with the powerful Soviet Union. Therefore, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has decided to collectively join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and will make even greater contributions on the front lines of resisting American and British imperialist aggression and aiding the Korean people's liberation struggle with all our efforts!
    
    All Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    November 7, 1951
