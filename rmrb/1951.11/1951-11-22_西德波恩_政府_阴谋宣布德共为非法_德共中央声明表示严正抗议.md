Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th: According to TASS, in order to further suppress the rising movement of the West German people for peace and unification, the West German Bonn "government" illegally decided on November 16th to suggest to the West German "Federal Constitutional Court" that the German Communist Party be declared an unconstitutional organization. The Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on November 18th in Düsseldorf regarding this matter, expressing a strong protest.

The statement first pointed out: When Hitler, Himmler, and Goering were preparing to murder millions of German men, women, and children, they first started by persecuting the German Communist Party. Now, Adenauer, Lehr (Bonn Minister of the Interior), and Dehler (Bonn Minister of Justice), with the assistance of the Federal Constitutional Court, are preparing to do the same, in order to sacrifice millions more Germans in a third world war. They are particularly in a hurry now because the great patriotic movement unfolding among the German people, demanding the unification of Germany on a democratic basis, has dealt a major blow to the remilitarization and war plans of Bonn and Washington.

The statement then said: When Hitler, Himmler, and Goering, for the benefit of Krupp, Stinnes, and Thyssen, prepared for the Second World War, hoping to establish world hegemony, and when they sacrificed German youth for these monopoly capitalists, they slandered the German Communist Party and persecuted it, because the German Communist Party was then the only party in Germany fighting to maintain peace and friendship with all countries.

The statement then pointed out: The German Communist Party is still against war preparations; the German Communist Party is in favor of convening an all-German conference to discuss the issue of free elections for a national assembly and demands the reunification of our motherland and the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Adenauer, Lehr, and Dehler, following the will of German and American imperialists, are attempting to strike at the German Communist Party in order to suppress the development of the powerful patriotic movement of the German people striving for German unification, striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to safeguard peace.

The statement concluded:

"Our people have the right to self-determination!

"Strive with all our might for peace and the freedom of our country! Strive with all our might to convene an all-German conference to discuss the issue of free and democratic elections for the German National Assembly and the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany!"

    西德波恩“政府”阴谋宣布德共为非法
    德共中央声明表示严正抗议
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德波恩“政府”为了进一步镇压日益高涨的西德人民争取和平与统一的运动，已于十一月十六日非法决定向西德“联邦宪法法庭”建议宣布德国共产党为违反宪法的组织。德国共产党中央委员会已就此事于十一月十八日在杜塞尔多夫发表声明，严正表示抗议。
    声明首先指出：当希特勒、希姆莱和戈林准备杀害千百万德国男女老少的时候，他们也是首先从迫害德国共产党开始的。现在，阿登纳、勒尔（波恩内政部长）和戴勒（波恩司法部长）在联邦宪法法庭的协助下，正准备干同样的勾当，以便再使千百万德国人牺牲在第三次世界大战中。他们现在特别匆忙，因为在德国人民中间展开的要求在民主基础上统一德国的伟大爱国运动，已经使波恩和华盛顿的重新军国主义化和战争的计划遭到了重大的打击。
    声明接着说：当希特勒、希姆莱和戈林为了克虏伯、斯汀纽斯和蒂森的利益而准备第二次世界大战，希望建立世界霸权的时候，当他们为了这些垄断资本家而牺牲德国青年的时候，他们曾诽谤德国共产党并且迫害它，因为德国共产党当时在德国是为维持和平及与一切国家的友好而斗争的唯一政党。
    声明然后指出：德国共产党现在仍然是反对战争准备的，德国共产党赞成召开全德会议，以讨论国民议会的自由选举问题，并要求把我们的祖国重新统一和尽速缔结对德和约。阿登纳、勒尔和戴勒遵照德国和美国帝国主义者的意志，企图打击德国共产党，就是为了要抑制德国人民争取德国统一、争取缔结对德和约以维护和平的强大爱国运动的发展。
    声明最后说：
    “我国人民有自决的权利！
    “全力争取和平与我们国家的自由！ “全力争取召开全德会议讨论德国国民议会的自由民主的选举问题及尽速缔结对德和约！”
