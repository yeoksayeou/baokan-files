Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 21st: Our front-line reporter reports: On November 17th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a counterattack against enemy positions on the right bank of the Imjin River, annihilating another British company and platoon. This is another glorious example of our Volunteer Army annihilating the enemy in company and battalion strength during blocking and counter-attack operations, following similar victories earlier this month.

	At 3:30 PM on November 17th, a unit of our Volunteer Army, with the support of powerful artillery fire, launched a counter-offensive against the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment, 28th Brigade of the British Army, at Hill 227 northwest of Gaowang-ri, approximately 17 kilometers west of Lianchuan. Our army's fierce artillery fire, combined with brave infantry, threw the enemy into utter confusion. Taking advantage of the enemy's disarray, our brave soldiers swiftly occupied Hill 227 in five minutes, completely annihilating the defending 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment, 28th Brigade of the British Army.

	Simultaneously, another unit of our Volunteer Army launched a counter-attack against the enemy guarding a small high ground west of Gaoxiazai-ri and Xincun, south of Ma Liang Mountain, and captured the high ground in fifteen minutes, completely annihilating a platoon of the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Ulster Rifles, 29th Brigade of the British Army. This battle further terrified the enemy.

	In these two counter-attacks, our army annihilated a total of 275 enemy soldiers, captured 11 light machine guns, and a quantity of other military supplies.

	The next day, an enemy company launched a counter-attack on Hill 227, but was repelled by our forces. Our army annihilated the majority of another enemy platoon, killing or wounding over 20 enemy soldiers and capturing a quantity of spoils of war.

Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, and the leaders of the British accomplice troops invading Korea, expressed fear about the increasing power of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and growing anxiety about the future of their war of aggression in Korea.

	According to a Washington dispatch from Dentsu News Agency on the 14th, Bradley, who recently inspected the Korean front, submitted a report to Truman and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett a few days ago. "Bradley said: 'For several months, U.S. casualties have reached numbers from two thousand to seven thousand per week.'" When referring to the current progress of the U.S. troops invading Korea, "Bradley believes: 'Ridgway will need at least twenty years to reach the Yalu River.'"

	The panic of the British accomplice troops' leaders is even more evident. According to a Reuters dispatch from Sydney on the 14th, the newly appointed Director-General of Australian Military Service, "former Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Forces in Korea and Japan, Robertson, said: 'The situation in Korea is very bad. He said: The enemy has better equipment such as mortars, artillery, rocket launchers, tanks, and aircraft. The enemy clearly has an unlimited supply of supplies and ammunition. ‘Our casualties are likely to increase even more.'"

	Robertson's successor, the new Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Forces in Korea and Japan, Bridgeford, also showed the same fear. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 16th, after inspecting the front lines, he helplessly admitted that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a "first-class force." He said: "The Communist army has the will to fight." "The Chinese army's artillery fire is concentrated and accurate. The Chinese army has demonstrated that they are well-equipped, have ample ammunition, and are well-trained." He said: "They can beat us to a pulp."

    人民志愿军又全歼英军一个连和一个排
    侵朝美英军头子们十分恐惧日益强大的中朝人民军队
   【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社前线记者报道：十一月十七日，中国人民志愿军向临津江右岸两高地敌人反击，又全歼英军一个连和一个排。这是我志愿军在阻击战和反击战中，继本月初成连成营歼敌后的又一光辉战例。
    十七日下午三时三十分，我志愿军某部在强大炮火配合下，向涟川正西约十七公里的高旺里西北二二七高地的英军二十八旅西洛浦团第一连进行反攻。我军猛烈的炮火协同勇猛的步兵，打得敌人慌乱万分。我军英勇的战士乘敌人张皇失措之际，以五分钟的时间，神速占领了二二七高地，全歼守敌英军二十八旅西洛浦团第一连。
    与此同时，我志愿军另部向马良山以南高栈下里、新村以西的小高地守敌进行反击，历十五分钟攻占该高地，全歼英军第二十九旅雷斯忒团第二连一个排。这一战斗，打得敌人更加惊恐。
    在这两次反击战中，我军共歼敌二百七十五名，缴获轻机枪十一挺，其他军用物资一部。
    次日，敌一个连向二二七高地反扑，被我击退，我军又歼敌一个排的大部，计毙伤敌二十余人，并缴获战利品一部。
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷和侵朝英国帮凶军的首领，对于中朝人民军队的日益强大表示恐惧，对于他们的侵朝战争前途日益感到忧虑不安。
    据电通社华盛顿十四日电报道：最近曾到朝鲜前线视察的布莱德雷在几天前曾向杜鲁门和美国国防部长罗维特提出报告。“布莱德雷说：几个月来美军的伤亡已到达了每星期两千人至七千人的数目”。在提到侵朝美军目前的进展情况时，“布莱德雷认为：李奇微至少要用二十年的光景才能到达鸭绿江”。
    英国帮凶军的首领们的恐慌，更加明显。据路透社悉尼十四日电透露：最近就任为澳大利亚兵役总监的“前驻朝鲜和日本的英联邦军总司令洛伯逊说：朝鲜的形势很恶劣。他说：敌人已用迫击炮、大炮、火箭炮、坦克与飞机更好的装备起来。敌人显然有无限的供应品和军火。‘我们的死伤恐怕要有更大的增加’。”
    洛伯逊的继承者、新任驻朝鲜和日本的英联邦军总司令布利治佛德，也表现出了同样的恐惧。据美联社十六日电透露：他在视察前线之后，就无可奈何地承认：中国人民志愿军是“第一流的部队”。他说：“共军有战斗意志”。“中国军队的大炮火力集中而正确。中国军队表明了他们装备精良，弹药充足，而且训练有素。”他说：“他们能把我们打得头破血流。”
