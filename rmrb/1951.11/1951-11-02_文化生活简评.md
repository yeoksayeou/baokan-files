Brief Review of Cultural Life

　　Crosstalk and Comedian Performers Should Correctly Interpret the Marriage Law and Other Policies and Regulations
　　Drama actors must make correct interpretations of the policies and regulations of the People's Government on stage, and must not have any distortions, so as not to cause adverse effects on the audience. However, according to many viewers, some actors often do not pay attention to this, resulting in incorrect interpretations of the policies and regulations of the People's Government. This phenomenon is most obvious in crosstalk and comedy performances.
　　Because the scripts of crosstalk and comedy are not very fixed, the actors can temporarily arrange interjections on stage. As a result, some actors often show off gimmicks and speak carelessly, resulting in a jumbled interpretation of the policies and regulations of the People's Government. For example, when Zhao Qiguai and Zhang Boyun from the Shanghai Great World Republican Hall performed comedy, they said: "After the implementation of the New Marriage Law, marriage only costs a thousand yuan; it's really saving money." They also said: "It is very easy to get married now, and it is also very easy to get divorced." Such interpretations are obviously wrong, and similar errors are not uncommon in crosstalk and comedy. The opera community, especially crosstalk and comedy actors, must strengthen their policy study and adopt a serious attitude towards policy propaganda.
　　Performance Programs in Amusement Parks Should Be Improved
　　Amusement parks are mostly places for the working people to have fun. Due to the variety of opera types and low ticket prices, it often has a large audience. For example, Shanghai's "Great World" has 10,000 to 20,000 viewers every day, and even 30,000 to 40,000 during festivals. How to use cultural and entertainment programs to educate this large audience in patriotism and democratic spirit is a very important issue.
　　Since liberation, various amusement parks have made some improvements, but these improvements are still far from enough. Many amusement parks still have many low-level, boring, feudal, superstitious, or pornographic and vulgar programs in their performances. For example, dance troupes dance Hollywood-style leg shows, and sing liberation songs in greasy voices; peep shows are full of leg stars, etc., sometimes juxtaposed with films reflecting the War of Liberation. Some troupes are still performing works like "Widow Ma Opens a Shop", "Strange Hero", and "Marriage". These phenomena have made many viewers unable to bear it anymore, and they have written letters to newspapers in various places such as Shanghai Opera News and "Mass Opera" and other publications, expressing protests and demanding improvement of these programs. These opinions are correct and should be taken seriously by relevant parties.
　　Improving the performance programs in amusement parks should be an important part of the reform work of amusement parks, and the reform work of amusement parks should be an important part of the opera reform work. The leadership of amusement parks and the artists should strengthen their study of political theory and opera reform policies, improve their level of awareness, and understand that with the improvement of the audience's awareness, those vulgar and backward programs will be rejected by more and more audiences. Only by following the opera reform policies and government decrees can we continue to be welcomed by the audience.

　　文化生活简评
  相声和滑稽戏艺人要正确解释婚姻法及其他政策法令
    戏曲演员在舞台上对人民政府的政策法令必须作正确的解释，不能有任何的歪曲，以免在观众中造成不良的影响。但据许多观众反映，有些演员常常对此不加注意，以致错误地解释了人民政府的政策法令。这种现象在相声、滑稽戏的演出中表现得最为明显。
    由于相声、滑稽戏的脚本的固定性不大，演员们可以在台上临时编排穿插。以致某些演员常常卖弄噱头，信口开河，结果把人民政府的政策法令乱解释一通。像上海大世界共和厅赵奇怪和张伯云两人演滑稽戏时说：“新婚姻法实行后，结婚只要一千块钱；真省。”还说：“现在结婚很容易，离婚也很容易。”这样的解释显然是错误的，类似的错误在相声、滑稽戏中是不少的。戏曲界，特别是相声、滑稽戏的演员们必须加强政策学习，对政策的宣传要采取严肃的态度。
  应该改进游艺场的演出节目
    游艺场多半是劳动人民游乐之地。由于剧种繁多，票价低廉，它经常拥有大量观众。像上海“大世界”，每天观众有一两万人，每逢节日，甚至有三、四万人。如何通过文化娱乐节目对这大量的观众进行爱国主义的和民主精神的教育，是一个十分值得重视的问题。
    各游艺场自解放以来，都有若干改进，但这些改进还是很不够的。许多游艺场在演出的节目中，仍有不少低级无聊的，封建迷信的，或者色情下流的节目。如歌舞团跳的是好莱坞式的大腿舞，唱的是用肉麻的声音唱出的解放歌曲；西洋镜里尽是大腿明星等等，有时和反映解放战争的影片并列。某些剧团还在演出《马寡妇开店》、《怪侠》、《姻缘》之类。这些现象已经使许多观众不能再忍受了，他们纷纷写信给各地报纸如上海戏曲报和《大众戏曲》等刊物，表示抗议，要求改进这些节目。这些意见是正确的，应该引起有关方面的重视。
    改进游艺场的演出节目应该是游艺场的改革工作中重要的部分，而游艺场的改革工作应该是戏曲改革工作的重要的一环。游艺场的领导方面和艺人们应该加强政治理论和戏曲改革政策的学习，提高自己的觉悟程度，应该懂得：随着观众觉悟的提高，那些庸俗落后的节目也将一天一天地遭到更多观众的唾弃。只有遵循戏曲改革政策和政府法令才能继续得到观众的欢迎。
