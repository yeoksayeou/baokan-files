Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th. Zhu Xuefan, head of the Chinese trade union delegation attending the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council meeting, reported on the 16th about the Chinese working class's struggle to build the motherland, improve people's well-being, and defend world peace. His speech was warmly welcomed by the participants. Zhu Xuefan first described the great achievements made by the Chinese working class on the production front in the past two years, pointing out that these achievements were obtained in the extensively carried out patriotic production emulation movement. He said: In mid-October last year, under the battle cry of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country, and through the initiation of model workers Li Yong, Zhao Guoyou, and Zhang Zifu, and the promotion of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and trade union organizations at all levels, a patriotic production emulation was widely launched. Now, this movement has spread to factories and enterprises all over the country. In the course of the movement, amazing new production records continue to emerge; the broad masses of workers have not only greatly improved their labor enthusiasm but have also used their brains and exerted their wisdom to solve various complex problems in improving production. According to last year's statistics, a total of 24,875 inventions and rationalization proposals were adopted throughout the country, which not only saved the country a huge amount of wealth but also greatly promoted the restoration and development of our industry.

Zhu Xuefan said: The Chinese working class is currently launching a movement to increase production and practice thrift. This year, the Northeast plans to increase production and save 10 million tons of grain, and various enterprises are actively mobilizing all employees to strive to complete this plan. This movement has been warmly responded to by workers across the country.

Zhu Xuefan pointed out the great role played by the Chinese working class in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. He described in detail how Chinese workers enthusiastically signed up to join the volunteer army, how they organized transportation teams, medical teams, and stretcher teams to support the front lines, and how they launched a patriotic movement to increase production and donations. He denounced the US imperialists for launching armed aggression against Korea, occupying China's Taiwan, carrying out military intervention in the national liberation movements of the Vietnamese and Filipino peoples, openly rearming Japan, concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan, and concluding the so-called US-Japan "Security Treaty," as well as concluding military alliance treaties with Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. Zhu Xuefan said: "These actions threaten China's security and peace in Asia, and worsen the situation in Asia." He condemned the US aggressors for delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, saying, "We are determined to strengthen our movement to resist America, aid Korea, and continue to work with the Korean people to fight until the US imperialists are willing to resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis."

Zhu Xuefan emphasized that the decisions adopted by the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council and the proposals put forward by Vyshinsky at the UN General Assembly clearly pointed out the way to resolve the Korean issue and defend world peace. He suggested that the WFTU Council meeting accept the proposal made by Soviet representative Soloviev on the 15th and pass a resolution supporting the resolutions of the World Peace Council meeting and calling on workers all over the world to strive for the realization of these resolutions.

Zhu Xuefan concluded by saying: "The achievements we have made in the past two years are also a victory for the working class and peace-loving people all over the world. This victory is a heavy blow to the imperialist warmongers. The reason why we have been able to achieve these achievements is not only because the Chinese working class and the Chinese people are as united as one, but also because they have received the friendly assistance of the working people of the world, especially the Soviet working people. The Chinese working class is deeply convinced based on its own experience that if the Asian working class can unite, it can guarantee the unity of the Asian people. If the working class all over the world can unite as one, the peace-loving people all over the world can unite to jointly oppose the imperialists; this can stop the imperialists' conspiracy to peddle war and guarantee world peace!"

[Xinhua News Agency, 19th] TASS, Berlin: The World Federation of Trade Unions Council continued its meeting on the evening of the 15th and the 16th to discuss the report on the work of the WFTU by Secretary-General Saillant. The meeting decided to establish a committee responsible for drafting a resolution on Saillant's report, and, according to the proposal of WFTU Chairman Vittorio, sent a telegram to express its respect to the French coal miners who are striking to oppose the government's wage cuts and revisions to the social insurance system.

At the meeting on the evening of the 15th, French representative Jourdain spoke to expose the French arms expansion movement instigated by US monopoly capital. He emphasized that the French working people are strengthening the consistency of their actions to oppose new wars and strive for a peaceful life.

Czechoslovak representative Šupka reported on the Czechoslovak trade unions' struggle to defend world peace. He stated that the Czechoslovak trade unions actively support the WFTU's struggle to defend the interests of workers all over the world.

Soviet representative Soloviev then spoke. He pointed out that the primary task of the WFTU in the struggle for peace is to unite all the forces of the working people, regardless of trade union affiliation, political views, or religious beliefs, to carry out the struggle to improve the economic conditions and social status of the working people. He said that in order to further strengthen the signature movement for the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact and strengthen the unity of the working people, it is necessary to relentlessly expose the slanderous propaganda of the warmongers to smear the peace camp and the traitorous policies of the right-wing trade union splitters. He finally assured that the Soviet trade unions will continue to do everything possible to expand and consolidate friendly relations with trade union organizations and working people in other countries, and will continue to actively help and support the WFTU.

The meeting on the 16th was first addressed by Chilean employee union representative Allegrio, who was attending the meeting as an observer. He assured that the Chilean trade unions will fight to establish a united front of the working people.

Chinese representative Zhu Xuefan described the great achievements of the People's Republic of China in politics, economy, and culture, and the Chinese people's struggle to defend peace. His speech was warmly welcomed by the entire audience.

German representative Warnke then spoke. He described the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in peaceful construction, and said with confidence that the day will surely come when the united German working class joins the WFTU.

The Japanese representative, who was attending the WFTU meeting for the first time, said that under the protection of the US occupiers, Japanese capitalists are attempting to completely restore the pre-war state of slave labor. Since the United States launched its war of aggression in Korea, the exploitation of the Japanese working people has become even more severe. Japanese progressive trade unions are now leading the Japanese working people in a heroic struggle to win their own rights, end the US aggression in Korea, and ensure world peace.

Iranian representative Rousta then reported on the heroic struggle of the Iranian working people against US-British imperialists.

Korean representative Hyun Heon stood up to speak amid warm applause from the audience. He thanked the representatives of the international trade union movement and thanked the working people all over the world for supporting the Korean people's struggle against the barbaric aggression of US imperialists.

Representatives from Guatemala, Black Africa, Italy, and the international secretary of the teachers' union, Delanu, also spoke at the meeting in support of Saillant's report.

    我国代表朱学范在世界工联理事会上
    报告我国工人阶级的巨大成就
    各国代表发言强调劳动人民团结争取和平 【新华社柏林十九日电】出席世界工会联合会理事会会议的中国工会代表团团长朱学范，在十六日会议上报告了中国工人阶级为建设祖国、增进人民幸福与保卫世界和平而斗争的情况，他的发言受到与会者的热烈欢迎。朱学范首先叙述了中国工人阶级两年来在生产战线上所取得的伟大成就，他指出这些成就是在广泛开展的爱国主义生产竞赛运动中获得的。他说：去年十月中旬，全国工人在抗美援朝保家卫国的战斗口号下，经过劳动模范李永、赵国有、张子富的发起，中华全国总工会和各级工会组织的推动，广泛地展开了爱国主义生产竞赛。现在，这一运动已普及到全国各地的工厂企业。在运动展开过程中，惊人的生产新纪录不断地出现；广大的工人群众不仅大大提高了劳动积极性，而且开动了脑筋，发挥智慧来解决改进生产中的各种复杂问题。根据去年的统计，全国各地共采用了二万四千八百七十五件发明创造和合理化建议，这不但替国家节约了巨大的财富，而且大大推动了我们工业的恢复与发展。
    朱学范说：中国工人阶级目前正在展开增产节约运动。今年东北计划增产节约一千万吨粮食，各企业单位正在积极动员全体职工为完成这一计划而奋斗。这个运动已获得了全国工人的热烈响应。
    朱学范指出了中国工人阶级在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中所起的巨大作用。他详细叙述了中国工人怎样热烈地报名要求参加志愿军，怎样组织运输队、医疗队和担架队支援前线，怎样发动爱国的增产捐献运动。他痛斥美帝国主义者发动对朝鲜的武装侵略，占领我国的台湾，对越南和菲律宾人民的民族解放运动进行军事干涉，公开重新武装日本，缔结单独的对日和约以及订立所谓美日“安全条约”，并与澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾缔结军事同盟条约。朱学范说：“这些行为威胁了中国的安全及亚洲的和平，使亚洲的局势恶化。”他斥责美国侵略者拖延朝鲜停战谈判，他说：“我们决心加强我们的抗美援朝运动，继续努力与朝鲜人民共同战斗，直到美帝国主义者愿意在公平合理的基础上解决朝鲜问题为止。”
    朱学范强调世界和平理事会维也纳会议所通过的决定以及维辛斯基在联合国大会会议上提出的建议，清楚地指出了解决朝鲜问题和保卫世界和平的途径。他建议世界工联理事会会议接受苏联代表索洛维耶夫十五日的提议，通过一项决议，支持世界和平理事会会议的各项决议，并号召全世界工人努力争取这些决议的实现。
    朱学范最后说：“两年来我们所取得的成就，也是全世界工人阶级和爱好和平的人民的胜利。这个胜利是对帝国主义战争贩子的沉重的打击。我们所以能够取得这些成就，不仅因为中国工人阶级和中国人民已经团结得像一个人一样，而且也因为他们获得了全世界劳动人民、特别是苏联劳动人民的友好援助。中国工人阶级根据自己的经验深信：如果亚洲工人阶级能够团结起来，就能够保证亚洲人民的团结，如果全世界工人阶级能够万众一心地团结起来，全世界爱好和平的人民也就能够团结起来共同反对帝国主义者；这样就能制止帝国主义者贩卖战争的阴谋，就能保障世界和平！”
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界工会联合会理事会在十五日晚间和十六日继续举行会议，讨论世界工联总书记赛扬关于世界工联工作的报告。会议决定设立负责起草关于赛扬报告的决议的委员会，并根据世界工联主席维多里奥的提议，致电向正在为反对政府削减工资和修改社会保险制度而罢工的法国煤矿工人致敬。
    在十五日晚间的会议上，法国代表儒丹发言揭露了在美国独占资本策动下的法国扩张军备运动。他强调说：法国劳动人民正在加强行动的一致，以反对新战争和争取和平的生活。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表苏普卡报告了捷克斯洛伐克工会进行保卫世界和平的斗争情况。他表示捷克斯洛伐克工会积极支持世界工联为保卫全世界工人的利益而进行的斗争。
    苏联代表索洛维耶夫接着发言。他指出：世界工联在争取和平斗争中的首要任务，就是不分工会派别和政治见解与宗教信仰，把劳动人民的一切力量团结起来，进行争取改善劳动人民的经济状况和社会地位的斗争。他说：为了进一步加强要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言的签名运动和加强劳动人民的团结，必须无情地揭露战争贩子污蔑和平阵营的诽谤宣传和右翼工会分裂分子的叛卖政策。他最后保证：苏联工会将继续尽一切办法扩大和巩固与其他国家的工会团体和劳动人民的友好关系，并继续积极地帮助和支持世界工联。
    十六日会议首由列席会议的智利职员工会代表阿莱格里奥发言，他保证说：智利工会将为建立劳动人民的统一战线而奋斗。
    中国代表朱学范在会上叙述了中华人民共和国在政治、经济和文化方面的巨大成就，和中国人民保卫和平的斗争，他的发言受到了全场热烈的欢迎。
    德国代表瓦恩克接着发言。他叙述了德意志民主共和国和平建设的成就，并充满信心地说：统一的德国工人阶级参加世界工联的那一天必将到来。
    第一次出席世界工联的会议的日本代表发言说：日本资本家在美国占领者的保护下企图完全恢复战前的奴隶劳动状况。自从美国在朝鲜发动侵略战争以来，日本劳动人民所受到的剥削已经更加厉害了。日本进步工会现在正领导着日本劳动人民，为争取他们的切身权利、终止美国在朝鲜的侵略和确保世界和平而英勇奋斗。
    伊朗代表路斯塔接着报告了伊朗劳动人民反对美英帝国主义者的英勇斗争的情况。
    朝鲜代表玄勋在全场热烈的掌声中起立发言。他向国际工会运动的代表们致谢，感谢全世界劳动人民支援朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义者的野蛮侵略的斗争。
    危地马拉、黑非洲、意大利的代表和教育工作者工会国际书记德拉努都相继在会上发言，拥护赛扬的报告。
