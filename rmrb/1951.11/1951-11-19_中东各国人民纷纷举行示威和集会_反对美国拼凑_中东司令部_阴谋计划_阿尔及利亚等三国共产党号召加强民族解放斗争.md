Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Recently, people in various Middle Eastern countries have held demonstrations and rallies, strongly opposing the U.S. scheme to form a Middle East aggressive bloc. In many cities of Syria, the masses, in demonstrations supporting the struggle of the Egyptian people, expressed their opposition to the proposal by the U.S., Britain, France, and Turkey to organize a "Middle East Command." On November 5th, thousands of workers and students in Damascus, the capital of Syria, demonstrated in front of the government building, opposing participation in the Middle East war pact. In Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, more than 1,000 people recently participated in a rally initiated by the People's United Front and the National Democratic Party. Hashimi, leader of the People's United Front, and Chadaqi, leader of the National Democratic Party, delivered speeches at the meeting, demanding that the government refuse to participate in the Middle East bloc. In Tel Aviv and Haifa, Israel, thousands of people held demonstrations and marches, protesting the plan to have Israel join the Middle East bloc. Wilner, a Communist member of the Israeli parliament, called on the Israeli people at a rally in Jerusalem to defeat the decision to make Israel a part of the North Atlantic war group. In Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, the masses held three demonstrations on November 7th against the four-nation proposal. Member of Parliament Suliman Ali demanded in parliament on the 6th that the government solemnly reject the four-nation proposal. The Cyprus Peace Committee telegraphed the British government on October 17th, opposing the attempt by U.S. and British imperialism to set up the planned "Middle East Command" in Cyprus.

    The Muslim Brotherhood's weekly publication "Al-Dawa" in Cairo recently commented on the four-nation proposal, pointing out: This is a new attempt to tie Arab countries to the chariot of Western imperialist countries. The people of the Middle East completely reject these proposals because acceptance would invite dire consequences. For millions of residents of Arab countries, the Middle East Command is the shackles of imperialism and long-term occupation.

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 13th, representatives of the Communist Parties of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, which are currently under French colonial rule, held a meeting in Algiers on November 5th. After the meeting, a declaration was issued, calling on the people of the three countries to unite and strengthen the national liberation struggle.

    The declaration first pointed out: The blood of the oppressed peoples is boiling, and they are striving to break free from the colonial shackles. In the Far East, the imperialists are about to be completely driven out; in the Near East and Middle East, their position is also precarious; thus, they want to find favorable ground in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia to maintain their colonial privileges and to intensify war preparations. The imperialists have adopted various barbaric means of suppression, but have encountered the growing strength of the national liberation movement. The events in Korea, Vietnam, Iran, and Egypt all show that a unified national struggle on one's own territory is the main condition for defeating imperialism. This fully confirms that the slogans put forward several years ago by the Communist Parties of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia to establish an anti-imperialist national united front were correct.

    The declaration then said: It is possible to advance rapidly on the road to liberation. To this end, it is necessary to unite all patriots and progressives in each country, act together, fight to meet national demands, and at the same time intensify support for those fraternal nations fighting for their liberation. At present, the Egyptian people should be supported in a particularly powerful way, and the French colonial war in Vietnam should also be resolutely opposed. The people of Morocco are now suffering from bloody suppression, and the Moroccan question has been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. At this time, Algeria and Tunisia should strengthen their support for the people of Morocco.

    The declaration finally emphasized: Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia should actively prepare for the Peace Conference of Near Eastern, Middle Eastern, and North African countries to be held in Cairo next January. This conference will greatly contribute to the struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries.

    阿尔及利亚等三国共产党号召加强民族解放斗争
    【新华社十八日讯】最近中东各国人民纷纷举行示威和集会，强烈反对美国筹组中东侵略集团的阴谋活动。叙利亚很多城市的人民群众在支持埃及人民斗争的示威中，表示反对美、英、法、土四国关于组织“中东司令部”的建议。在十一月五日，叙利亚首都大马士革有数千名工人和学生到政府大厦前示威，反对参加中东战争公约。伊拉克首都巴格达最近有一千多人参加由人民联合阵线和国家民主党发起的大会，人民联合阵线领袖哈希米和国家民主党领袖查大基在会上发表演说，要求政府拒绝参加中东集团。在以色列首都特拉维夫和海法港，有数千人举行示威游行，抗议要以色列加入中东集团的计划。以色列议会共产党议员威尔诺在耶路撒冷集会上，号召以色列人民击败使以色列成为北大西洋战争集团的一部分的决定。在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特，人民群众于十一月七日举行三次反对四国建议的示威游行，议员苏里曼阿里六日在议会要求政府严正拒绝四国建议。塞浦路斯和平委员会十月十七日致电英国政府，反对美英帝国主义企图把计划中的“中东司令部”设在塞浦路斯。
    回教兄弟会在开罗的机关报“良药”周刊最近在评论四国建议时指出：这是想把阿拉伯国家拴到西方帝国主义国家的战车上去的新企图，中东人民完全拒绝这些建议，因为如果接受就会招惹险恶的后果。对阿拉伯国家数百万居民说来，中东司令部就是帝国主义的枷锁和长期的占领。
    【新华社十六日电】据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：现在法国殖民者统治下的阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯三国共产党的代表十一月五日在阿尔及尔举行会议，会后发表宣言，号召三国人民团结一致，加强民族解放斗争。
    宣言首先指出：被压迫的各族人民热血已经沸腾，并正在努力挣脱殖民的枷锁。在远东，帝国主义者快要完全被赶出去了；在近东和中东，他们的地位也摇摇欲坠；于是他们就想在阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯找到有利的地盘，来维持他们的殖民特权，来加紧备战。帝国主义者采取了种种野蛮的镇压手段，但是却碰到了民族解放运动不断壮大的力量。朝鲜、越南、伊朗和埃及的事件都表明：在本国领土上进行举国一致的斗争，是战胜帝国主义的主要条件。这就完全证实了阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯的共产党数年前分别提出建立反帝民族统一战线的口号是正确的。
    宣言接着说：要在解放的道路上迅速前进是可能的。为此，必须在每一个国家团结一切爱国分子和进步分子，共同行动，为满足民族要求而斗争，同时加紧支援那些为自己的解放而斗争的兄弟民族。目前应该特别有力地支援埃及人民，同时也应该坚决反对法国对越南的殖民战争。现在摩洛哥人民正在遭受血腥的镇压，摩洛哥问题已提交联合国大会。在这个时候，阿尔及利亚和突尼斯应该加强他们对摩洛哥人民的支援。
    宣言最后着重指出：阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯应当为明年一月在开罗举行的近东、中东和北非国家的和平大会积极作准备。这个大会对于殖民地与附属国人民的斗争会有很大贡献。
