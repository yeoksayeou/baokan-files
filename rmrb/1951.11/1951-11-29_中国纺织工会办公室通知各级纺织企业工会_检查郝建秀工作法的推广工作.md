    Strive to Promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Nationwide
    The Office of the Chinese Textile Trade Union Notifies Textile Enterprise Trade Unions at All Levels to Inspect the Promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method

    The Office of the National Committee of the Chinese Textile Trade Union issued a notice on November 24, requesting trade union organizations in textile enterprises at all levels to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The notice, after affirming the achievements of various regions in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, pointed out that there are still many serious problems in the current promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method: some units only promote it among spinning workers, while neglecting the improvement of work in pre-spinning, maintenance, and other departments; some units do not sufficiently integrate promotion work with political education; and all units have not established a reward system, or have not correspondingly increased workers' wages when promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, thus greatly affecting the enthusiasm of the masses of workers in learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. What is particularly serious is that the leading cadres of individual units still do not sufficiently recognize the superiority of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and harbor conservative ideas and complacency, thus fueling the antagonistic attitude of some technicians and workers towards the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and even suppressing Hao Jianxiu workers. These phenomena are major obstacles to further promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, increasing production, and practicing thrift.

    Therefore, the notice requires trade union organizations at all levels to immediately organize inspection teams, under the leadership of Communist Party organizations at all levels, and in close cooperation with administrative departments and the Communist Youth League, to absorb Hao Jianxiu workers and outstanding technicians and workers to participate in a thorough inspection of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The notice requires that through this inspection, all erroneous ideas that do not attach importance to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should be corrected, the enthusiasm of employees in learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should be consolidated and enhanced, pre-spinning and maintenance work should be strengthened, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should be enriched and improved, and a regular inspection system should be established. The notice requires trade union organizations at all levels to assist administrative departments or capitalists in formulating reward systems during the inspection, and to give timely honorary and material rewards to employees who have achieved results in implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and to establish a yarn weighing system so that workers' wages can be increased accordingly after learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    The notice finally pointed out that the promotion and inspection of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should be closely combined with the current central task of a production surge, so that every spinning worker in every textile factory can truly master the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and that learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should be regarded as an important method for completing the task of a production surge in response to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing thrift.

    为在全国范围内推广郝建秀工作法而斗争
    中国纺织工会办公室通知各级纺织企业工会
    检查郝建秀工作法的推广工作
    中国纺织工会全国委员会办公室十一月二十四日发出通知，要求各级纺织企业的工会组织普遍检查郝建秀工作法的推广工作。通知在肯定了各地推广郝建秀工作法的成绩后，指出目前郝建秀工作法推广工作中还存在许多严重问题：有的单位只在细纱工人中推广，而忽略了改进前纺、保全及其他部门的工作；有的单位推广工作和政治教育结合不够；所有单位没有建立奖励制度，或在推广郝建秀工作法时没有相应地增加工人工资，因而大大影响了工人群众学习郝建秀工作法的积极性。特别严重的是个别单位的领导干部到现在还对郝建秀工作法的优越性认识不足，存在着保守思想和自满情绪，因而助长了某些技术人员和工人对郝建秀工作法的对抗态度，甚至打击了郝建秀工作者。这些现象是进一步推广郝建秀工作法、增加生产、厉行节约的重大障碍。
    因此，通知要求纺织工会各级组织立即组织检查组，在各级共产党组织的领导下，和行政、青年团密切配合，吸收郝建秀工作者及优秀的技术人员和工人参加，切实检查郝建秀工作法的推广工作。通知要求通过这次检查，纠正一切不重视郝建秀工作法的错误思想，巩固和提高职工学习郝建秀工作法的积极性，加强前纺和保全工作，充实和提高郝建秀工作法，建立经常性的检查制度。通知要求纺织工会各级组织在检查中协助行政或资方订立奖励制度，对执行郝建秀工作法有成绩的职工及时给以荣誉的和物质的奖励，并建立成纱过磅制度，使学习郝建秀工作法后工人的工资相应增加。
    通知最后指出，郝建秀工作法的推广和检查工作，应和突击增产这一当前的中心任务紧密结合起来，使每个纺织厂的每个细纱工人都能确实掌握郝建秀工作法，并把学会郝建秀工作法作为自己完成突击增产任务响应毛主席增产节约号召的一个重要方法。（新华社）
