Some Thoughts on Participating in the Production of the Film "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities"
Wu Benli

After the film "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" was released, it was well received by audiences, and it was also awarded the Special Honorary Award for Documentary Films at the 6th International Film Festival held in Czechoslovakia this year. This is mainly because the film correctly reflects the victory of Mao Zedong's ethnic policy and the close unity of all nationalities in New China; and this unity is extremely important for consolidating our people's democratic power, strengthening our national defense, and building our motherland. The great unity of all nationalities in our country is one of the important forces for repelling imperialist aggression and consolidating world peace. Therefore, a film reflecting this situation can occupy an important position in world cinema.

In addition to more perfectly recording some news scenes, this film also carefully records the culture and art of various nationalities, mainly the beautiful songs and dances of various nationalities. Therefore, this film can enable people to happily experience that all nationalities in our country are nationalities with a long history and a long cultural tradition. This aspect of the reflection is very necessary.

On the other hand, when we reflect the unity of all nationalities in our country, it is reflected in connection with the scenes of our country welcoming representatives of people from all over the world to Beijing, and in connection with the internationalist spirit of our people.

This film is full of the joyful emotions of representatives of all nationalities participating in various activities in the capital, and at the same time, it reveals the genuine friendship and real feelings between the various nationalities in many ways.

This film reveals the close and enthusiastic situation of our great leader Chairman Mao and the main leaders of the Central People's Government receiving representatives of all nationalities. Through these, the great and brilliant ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government has been fully demonstrated.

All these achievements are the result of the close ideological guidance of the heads of our Central People's Government to the production of this film; the result of the government heads initiating the production of this film; and the result of the unity and cooperation, enthusiastic labor, and careful study of ethnic policies by all the staff of this film.

And I personally am only, under the above conditions, participating in the study of ethnic policies, and also acting as an organizer to convey national policies and the intentions of the Party. Therefore, the following points of understanding are also put forward from this perspective:

First, at first, we used to express the unity of the various nationalities in China in isolation, and did not pay attention to the important background of international unity. For example, in the scene where Chairman Mao hosted a banquet to celebrate the National Day on September 30th last year, in order to "save trouble" in editing, we deleted the shots of international friends invited by Chairman Mao at that banquet, thinking that these materials should be used in other films and can be omitted in this film. This is the result of understanding the ethnic policy in isolation and one-sidedly. Later, after the leadership emphatically pointed out that this was inappropriate, we quickly corrected it. This made me realize from my specific work the unity of domestic ethnic policy and foreign policy, and the indivisibility of patriotism and internationalism. My narrow-minded thinking has been corrected.

Second, after the representatives of all nationalities came to Beijing, at the time of editing the scene where Premier Zhou of the State Council of the Central People's Government hosted a banquet for the representatives of all nationalities, I simply felt in my mind that the banquet scenes in the film should be avoided too much, so I only selected a very few shots of Premier Zhou's banquet for the representatives of all nationalities and inserted them in front of Chairman Mao's banquet, which showed that we did not correctly understand that this time the representatives of all nationalities came to Beijing to participate in the National Day was invited by the State Council of the Central People's Government, and more importantly, Premier Zhou made an extremely important explanation of the ethnic policy at this banquet. After timely correction by the leadership, we realized this serious shortcoming. Although we usually understand the principle that art should be subordinate to politics, we may still make mistakes that deviate from this principle in our work.

Third, this film is relatively comprehensive in filming the various activities of the representatives of all nationalities coming to Beijing, and it is also more popular with the audience. But the shortcoming is that we have not yet compared the happy, enthusiastic, and closely united scenes of the representatives of all nationalities in Beijing with the miserable and unfree lives of all nationalities under the rule of the reactionary Han chauvinism in the past through explanatory words and picture comparisons, so that the great unity of all nationalities in New China is set off more vividly and powerfully. This is because our design in our work is not sufficient and our thinking is not deep enough.

If we could design the production of this film more carefully and thoughtfully, we could have achieved better work results and made the film have a new realistic artistic expression. Related to this shortcoming is that the compilation of this film is not concise enough.

In short, the achievements of the work are the result of the advocacy and leadership of the Party and the government. The shortcomings in the work reflect that our own political and ideological level and artistic creation level still need to be greatly improved. As for myself, in this work, I should explain that the cooperation and co-existence with the advanced Soviet artists in the film "The Victory of the Chinese People" in the previous period was of great help to my education and improvement. It was precisely in this previous cooperation and co-existence that I increased a lot of knowledge, which strengthened my ability to independently handle the work of the important theme of "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities". More importantly, the education of the Chinese Communist Party and the struggle life of the people in the liberated areas have fundamentally cultivated me, enabling me to be improved and transformed from an ordinary film technician into an artistic worker of the people's film. I should thank the Party and Chairman Mao, and thank the Chinese people and Soviet friends for their profound education to me. (Attached picture)

    参加制作“中国民族大团结”影片的一点体会
    吴本立
    影片“中国民族大团结”放映后，曾获观众好评，在本年捷克举行的第六届国际电影赛会上，并光荣地得到了记录片特别荣誉奖。这主要是由于影片正确地反映了毛泽东民族政策的胜利，反映了新中国各民族的亲密团结；而这种团结对于巩固我国的人民民主政权，加强我们的国防，和建设我们的祖国，是极其重要的。我国民族的大团结，是击退帝国主义侵略与巩固世界和平的重要力量之一。因此反映这一情况的影片，就能够在世界电影作品中，占一重要地位。
    这部影片，除比较完美地记录了若干新闻场面外，还用心地记录了各民族的文化艺术，主要是各民族的优美的歌舞。因而，这部影片，可以使人们愉快地体验到：我国各民族都是历史悠久、有着长久文化传统的民族。这一方面的反映是很必要的。
    另一方面，当我们反映我国国内各民族团结的时候，是与我国欢迎世界各国人民代表来京的镜头联系在一起，是与我国人民的国际主义精神联系在一起来反映的。
    这部影片，充满了各民族代表在首都参加各项活动时的欢愉的情绪，同时又从多方面地显露了各民族之间的真正的友谊、真实的感情。
    这部影片，显露了我国伟大领袖毛主席及中央人民政府主要首长接待各民族代表的亲密热情的情形。通过这些，中国共产党及人民民主政府伟大英明的民族政策，得到了充分的表现。
    所有的这些成绩，都是我中央人民政府首长，对本片的摄制，加以密切的思想指导的结果；都是政府首长创议摄制此片的结果；都是本片所有工作人员团结合作，热情劳动和细心学习民族政策的结果。
    而我个人，不过是在以上的诸条件下，参加了民族政策的学习，同时也做了一个传达国家政策和党的意图的组织者而已。因此下面的几点体会，也是从这一个角度上提出来的：
    第一，起先，我们曾经孤立地表现国内各民族的团结，不曾注意国际团结的重要背景。例如毛主席于去年九月三十日设宴欢庆国庆节的一场，我们为了编辑上的“省事”起见，把毛主席在那次宴会中所邀请的国际友人的镜头删掉了，以为这些材料应该用在别的影片中，在这张影片中可以略去。这是孤立片面地了解民族政策的结果。后来经过领导方面着重地指出，这一点不妥当，我们就迅速地纠正了。这使我从具体工作中认识到国内民族政策与外交政策的统一，爱国主义与国际主义的不可分割性。自己的狭隘思想得到了纠正。
    第二，当各民族代表来到北京之后，中央人民政府政务院周总理宴请各民族代表的一场，在编辑的当时，思想上只是单纯地觉得应避免影片中宴会场面过多，就将周总理欢宴各民族代表的镜头，仅挑选了极少数的一些镜头插在毛主席的宴会的前面，这就表现了我们没有正确地了解这一次各民族代表来北京参加国庆节，是由中央人民政府政务院邀请的，更重要的是周总理在这个宴会上，对民族政策作了极其重要的说明。经过领导方面及时纠正后，我们才认识到这一严重的缺点。平时我们虽然懂得艺术服从政治的原则，但在工作中有时仍会产生离开这一原则的错误。
    第三，这部影片，在拍摄来京各民族代表的各种活动方面，是比较全面的，也是观众比较爱看的。但缺点就在我们还没有把各民族代表在京愉快热烈、亲密团结的画面，与过去反动派大汉族主义统治下，各民族悲惨的不自由的生活通过说明辞与画面对比起来，联系起来，使新中国各民族大团结这一事实，衬托得更为鲜明，更为有力。这是由于我们在工作上设计不够，和思考不深刻之故。
    假如我们能更加周密地，深思熟虑地来设计这一影片的摄制，则还可以得出更好的工作成绩，可以使影片能具备新现实主义的艺术表现。与此缺点相联系的，是这影片在编制上还不够简炼。
    总之，工作的成绩，是由于党与政府倡议领导的结果。工作中的缺点，反映了我们自己的政治思想水平和艺术创作水平还是需要大大提高。对我自己呢，在这次工作中，却应该说明：前一时期在“中国人民的胜利”一片中与苏联先进艺术家们的合作共处，对我的教育和提高，是大有帮助的。正是在前一合作共处中增加了不少知识，使我加强了独立处理“中国民族大团结”这一重大题材的工作能力。更重要的是长久以来，中国共产党的教育，解放区人民的斗争生活，从根本上培养了我，使我从一个普通的电影技术人员，提高和改造成为人民电影的艺术工作者，我是应该感谢党和毛主席，感谢中国人民和苏联友人对我的深刻教育的。（附图片）
