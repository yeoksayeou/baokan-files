The Datong Coal Mine Promotes Ma Liuhai Team Experience
    Tunneling Efficiency Universally Improved

    The state-owned Datong Coal Mine has earnestly promoted the advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai team, and tunneling efficiency has universally improved. Among the nineteen tunneling teams in the mine using electric drills, four teams achieved tunneling progress exceeding 400 meters in August, three teams exceeded 300 meters, and six teams exceeded 200 meters; the tunneling progress of these thirteen teams all exceeded the highest record in April. According to statistics at the end of September, the mine's tunneling efficiency per worker increased by 45.95 percent compared to April; the rate of gunpowder consumption decreased by 3.05 percent, and the rate of electric detonator consumption decreased by 6.83 percent.

    In the process of promoting the Ma Liuhai team's experience, the "Ma Liuhai Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" played a significant role. This class not only conducted patriotic education, but also had Ma Liuhai serve as an instructor, introducing experience through practical demonstrations, and also resolved certain ideological problems among workers in the initial stage of promotion. For example, after the mine held a celebration for the Ma Liuhai team, most workers expressed their intention to emulate Ma Liuhai, but some veteran workers were unconvinced. Workers like Zhao You and Wang Zhande had seven or eight years of experience using electric drills, while Ma Liuhai only began learning to use electric drills last December. They believed that the Ma Liuhai team's drilling and blasting techniques were not as good as their own, and even said: "Ma Liuhai advances 200 meters, next month we will advance 400 meters, let's see who is higher and who is lower!" In response to these specific situations, the "Dissemination Class" emphasized that the reason why Zhao You and other teams had good skills but could not improve efficiency was precisely because they lacked scientific work methods. The class also encouraged all tunneling workers, saying: as long as they humbly learn Ma Liuhai's advanced work methods, they can also create excellent results.

    By the end of the "Dissemination Class," fifteen teams had proposed plans to learn from the Ma Liuhai team's experience, set their August struggle goals, and launched a competition. Veteran workers like Zhao You also specifically introduced their drilling and blasting methods, helping Ma Liuhai further improve his techniques. Due to the mutual and humble learning of advanced experience, the tunneling progress of each team in the mine in August increased by more than 30 percent compared to June. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 大同煤矿推广马六孩小组经验  各组掘进效率普遍提高

　　大同煤矿推广马六孩小组经验
    各组掘进效率普遍提高
    国营大同煤矿认真推广马六孩小组的先进经验，掘进效率普遍提高。在该矿十九个使用电钻的掘进小组中，八月份就有四个小组的掘进进度超过四百公尺，三个小组超过三百公尺，六个小组超过二百公尺；这十三个小组的掘进进度都超过了四月份的最高纪录。据九月底的统计，全矿每工掘进效率较四月份提高百分之四十五点九五；火药消耗率降低百分之三点零五，电管消耗率降低百分之六点八三。
    该矿在推广马六孩小组经验的过程中，“马六孩先进经验传播班”起了很大作用。这个班不仅进行了爱国主义教育，并由马六孩担任教员，用实地表演的方法介绍经验，同时解决了推广初期工人中某些思想问题。如在该矿为马六孩小组举行庆功会后，大部分工人表示要向马六孩看齐，但部分老工人不服气。如赵有、王占德等使用电钻已有七、八年的经验，马六孩去年十二月才开始学使用电钻，他们认为马六孩小组打眼放炮的技术还不如自己，还说：“马六孩进二百公尺，下月我们要进四百公尺，看谁高谁低！”“传播班”根据这些具体情况，着重指出赵有等小组所以技术好效率提不高，正是因为缺乏科学工作法的缘故。该班并鼓励全体掘进工人说：只要虚心学习马六孩的先进工作法，便同样能创造出优良的成绩。
    当“传播班”结束时，已有十五个小组提出学习马六孩小组经验的计划，订出八月份的奋斗目标，展开竞赛。赵有等老工人也具体介绍了他们的打眼放炮法，帮助马六孩进一步提高技术。由于相互虚心学习先进经验，八月份该矿每组的掘进进度都较六月份提高百分之三十以上。（新华社）
