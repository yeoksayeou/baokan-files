    Yuci Shitie Town People's Bank Branch
    Conduct Rural Financial Work Through Mutual Aid Teams
    I think the method of the Shitie Town People's Bank Branch in Yuci County to carry out rural financial work through mutual aid teams is worth promoting. The Shitie Town Branch first focused on helping the nearby rural mutual aid teams, giving them certain preferential treatment for deposits and loans. After some groups of farmers in Berlin Head Village understood the bank's policies and obtained practical benefits from depositing and lending money in the bank, they publicized the group's plans, how much they would deposit and borrow from the bank, and what benefits they would get to the masses throughout the village. As a result, out of the 190 households in the village, 42 now have deposits in the bank, with an average of 170,000 yuan per household. Farmers are no longer willing to store grain rigidly. Many people exchange grain for money and deposit it in the bank, thus enlivening the rural economy of the town.

    Introducing the Method of Shijiazhuang Prefecture to Solve the Problem of Overstocked Seed Cotton
    In order to solve the problem of overstocked seed cotton in cooperatives and to implement the spirit of "fast collection, fast ginning, and fast transportation" in cotton purchasing, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Shulu County Government in Hebei Province vigorously organized rural and urban (mainly Shijiazhuang City) powered cotton gins for processing. The Finance and Economics Committee of Shijiazhuang Prefecture also decided to adopt the method of transferring processing, transferring 5 million jin of seed cotton to Shijiazhuang for processing from counties with the most overstocked seed cotton (such as Shulu County, which must transfer 600,000 jin of seed cotton to Shijiazhuang City within six days). In order to limit the continued accumulation of inventory at the grassroots cooperatives, the committee also stipulated that the seed cotton stored in each cooperative should not exceed one day's processing volume. I think this method is worth introducing to various places at present.

    Opposing the Waste of Steel Rails
    Comrade Editor: When I went to Yi County from Hanzhuang (southwest of Yixian County, Shandong) in early October, I passed several wooden bridges. I found that the bridge beams under the wooden bridges were all made of steel rails; in addition, there were six or seven steel rails placed in a mountain gully, and they had all been bent. When I came back, I carefully counted them, and there were a total of more than 20 steel rails thrown in the mountain gully. If each rail is calculated at 1,000 jin of millet, it would be a waste of more than 20,000 jin of millet in state property.
    Steel rails are important equipment for railways. Our country is currently vigorously building railways and developing transportation, and the steel rails manufactured by factories cannot keep up with the needs of various places. How can they be misused or thrown in mountain gullies without being properly kept? Therefore, I suggest that the Jinan Railway Administration urge relevant departments and local governments to quickly deal with this matter.

    Newspaper Correspondents Should Help Newspapers Do a Good Job in Eliminating Errors
    Recently, newspapers in various places have launched a campaign to "strive to eliminate errors in newspapers," which is a good phenomenon. I think correspondents should help newspapers accomplish this task. In the past, some correspondents took an extremely unserious attitude towards news reports, and did not pay attention to the authenticity of the reports, which caused errors in the newspapers. For example, in mid-October this year, Comrade Xia Rusong of the CPC Hanshou County Committee Office in Hunan Province reported news that a certain innkeeper attempted to rape his young daughter, which was not true. Fortunately, it was discovered in time and not published in the newspaper, avoiding this error. Therefore, if newspaper correspondents only rely on hearsay and do not conduct in-depth investigation and research before writing articles, serious errors will inevitably occur, reducing the credibility of the Party newspaper among the masses. I hope that all correspondent comrades will establish a pragmatic and serious work style to help newspapers do a good job in eliminating errors.

    Publishers Should Take More Care of Readers
    Since liberation, many authors and publishers have taken a more serious attitude towards publications and have made revisions to many books in subsequent editions. However, some books sold in large quantities in the first edition. After revision and reprinting, many readers who bought the first edition cannot afford to buy another copy due to economic constraints. Therefore, I suggest that authors and publishers, when revising and reprinting existing publications, in addition to briefly pointing out the modifications in the advertisements for the new version of the book, should also publish the main modifications in newspapers and magazines; the best way is to print a correction sheet, which is distributed to readers by the issuing bookstore or requested by readers (a handling fee may be charged if necessary). When works published in magazines are published as separate editions after revision, it is best to publish the correction sheet in the original magazine as well.

    Renminbi Should Not Be Damaged Wantonly
    Recently, the phenomenon of not cherishing and destroying Renminbi has been very serious in some areas. For example, in areas such as Jugang in northern Jiangsu, some stores tear up 1,000-yuan notes to use as two 500-yuan notes due to a lack of small denominations; some tear up 5,000-yuan notes to use as two 2,500-yuan notes. Even the Jugang office of the China Department Store actually does this. In addition, during the summer tax collection in Lingbao County, Henan Province, it was found that some people had altered 1,000-yuan notes to 5,000-yuan notes. We hope that governments and People's Banks in various places will pay attention to this and correct it.

    来信摘要
    榆次什贴镇人民银行营业所
    通过互助组开展农村金融工作
    榆次县什贴镇人民银行营业所，通过互助组开展农村金融工作的办法，我认为值得推广。什贴镇营业所首先抓紧了对附近农村互助组的帮助，对它们存款放款都给予一定的优先待遇。柏林头村有些组的农民懂得银行政策，获得银行存放款的实际利益后，就在村子里到处把组内计划和在银行存多少，贷多少，得到什么好处等向群众进行宣传。结果，该村一百九十户中，现已有四十二户在银行有了存款，平均每户存十七万元。农民再不愿意死板地存粮食了。很多人都把粮食换成钱存入银行，该镇农村经济因此活跃起来。人民银行山西省分行    付生
    介绍石家庄专区解决积压籽棉
    问题的办法
    河北省石家庄专署及束鹿县政府，为了解决合作社积压籽棉的问题，贯彻在购棉工作中快收、快轧、快运的精神，大力组织乡间和城市（主要是石家庄市）动力轧花机进行加工。石家庄专区财经委员会并决定采用调出加工的办法，从积压籽棉最多的县份（如束鹿一县须于六天内调石家庄市籽棉六十万斤）调籽棉五百万斤到石家庄加工。该会为了限制各基层社续有积压，并规定各社所存籽棉最多不得超过一天的加工量。我认为这一办法在目前值得向各地介绍。    戴冀农
    反对浪费钢轨现象编辑同志：我在十月初由韩庄（山东峄县西南）去峄县时，路过几座木桥。我发现木桥下面的桥梁，都是用钢轨做的；另外在一处山沟里也放了六七条钢轨，而且都已被折弯了。我回来时仔细数了一下，扔在山沟里的总共有二十多条，若每条以一千斤小米计算，就浪费了国家财产二万余斤小米。
    钢轨是铁路上的重要器材。我们国家目前正在大力修建铁路，发展交通事业，工厂所造的钢轨还赶不上各地的需要，怎能滥用或扔在山沟里不加保管呢？因此，我建议济南铁路管理局督促有关部门与当地地方政府迅速处理此事。    曙光
    报纸通讯员应帮助报纸做好
    消灭错误的工作
    最近各地报纸都展开了“为消灭报纸的错误而奋斗”的运动，这是一个很好的现象。我认为通讯员应该帮助报纸完成这一任务。过去有些通讯员，对通讯报道采取极不严肃的态度，不注意报道的真实性而使报纸发生了错误。如今年十月中旬，中共湖南汉寿县委办公室夏汝宋同志，报道某客栈老板企图强奸其幼女的消息就不是事实，幸经及时发觉，没有在报纸上发表，避免了这个错误。因此，报纸通讯员如果只凭道听途说，不深入调查研究，就作文章，一定会发生严重的错误，降低党报在群众中的威信。希望各位通讯员同志，树立实事求是和严肃的工作作风，来帮助报纸做好消灭错误的工作。

    出版家应多多照顾读者
    解放以来，很多作者和出版家对出版物的态度都比较认真了，对不少书籍在再版时作了修订。但有些书在初版时销行的数量很大，修订再版后，买了初版本的读者，有很多人限于经济力量不能再买一本。为此，我建议作者和出版家，在原有出版物修订再版时，除在该书新版本的广告中扼要指出修改处外，并应把主要的修改内容刊登在报纸杂志上；最好的办法是印成修正表，由发行的书店分送读者或由读者索取（必要时可酌收工本费）。杂志上发表的著作在修改后出单行本时，最好也把修正表登在原杂志上。    李苇
    不应该随意损坏人民币
    最近有些地区，不爱护和破坏人民币的现象很严重。如苏北掘港等地区，有的商店因零票缺乏，便把一千元票撕开，当两张五百元的用；有的把五千元票子撕开当作两张二千五百元的用，甚至中国百货公司掘港办事处也竟这样做。又如河南灵宝县夏征收款中间，曾发现有的人把一千元的票子，涂改成五千元的。我们希望各地政府和人民银行对此引起注意，并予以纠正。
