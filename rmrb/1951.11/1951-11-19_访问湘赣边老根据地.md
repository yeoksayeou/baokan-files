Visiting the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Region
    Zhu Xuefan
    I. In August and September of this year, I participated in the Central People's Government's Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group and visited the old revolutionary base areas of the Hunan-Jiangxi border region. I worked in various places for more than thirty days and came into contact with hundreds of thousands of people from the old base areas and old guerrilla areas. This visit left a very deep impression on me.

    The old revolutionary base areas of the Hunan-Jiangxi border region include southwestern Jiangxi and southeastern Hunan, located in the central part of the Luoxiao Mountains. Jinggang Mountain is situated within the counties of Suichuan, Ninggang, Yongxin, and Lingxian. It was the earliest revolutionary base area established personally by Chairman Mao during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and is the birthplace of the Chinese People's Revolution. After these base areas were established, the Chinese Communist Party forged close ties with the people here, established revolutionary political power, organized revolutionary armies, trained revolutionary talents, implemented land reform, tested the Party's various policies, and gained rich experience in revolutionary struggle, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent nationwide revolutionary victory. At the same time, under the education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the people here recognized that only by resolutely following Chairman Mao and the Communist Party could they achieve liberation. Therefore, they displayed a high degree of revolutionary spirit and patriotic enthusiasm, engaged in a long and arduous revolutionary struggle against the brutal Kuomintang bandits, fought countless battles, and achieved countless victories. After the Red Army marched north, the Kuomintang bandits, feudal forces, and landlord despots carried out瘋狂狂殺insane slaughter against the people here, but the people never yielded, persisting in guerrilla warfare and other forms of revolutionary struggle until the nationwide liberation. In the cruel revolutionary war, the people sacrificed countless lives and suffered unparalleled devastation, but they also trained countless revolutionary talents and created countless epic and moving historical facts. The people of the old revolutionary base areas made great contributions to the revolutionary cause and should be loved and respected by the people of the whole country! II. When talking with the people of the old revolutionary base areas, they will tell you with great hatred about the serious devastation and damage they suffered during the rule of the Kuomintang bandits; they will also excitedly tell you many heroic deeds of brave Communist Party members and the people fighting against the enemy.

    The Kuomintang bandits implemented the so-called "Three Alls" policy against the people here. According to direct and indirect information: in Chaling County alone, more than twenty thousand revolutionary workers and people were killed; taking the Fourth District as an example, this district had six townships, including Shangyao, Xiayao, and Taojiang, with a total of one thousand one hundred people killed. In the Chenzhou sub-district alone, there are more than 135,000 registered families of martyrs, more than 50% of whom have no descendants. In Dayuan, Shizhouli Township, Fourth District of Lingxian County, there were originally 360 households with more than 1,000 people, but now there are only 75 households with 248 people. In Leiyang, the "Three Great Butchers," Duan Ziwei, Tan Doucai, and Li Jikun, killed more than 3,000 revolutionary workers and people. Before the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Ninggang County had a population of 130,000, but now only 35,000 remain. In the four districts of Poyang, Litian, Shiqiao, and Huaizhong in Yongxin County, the population during the First Domestic Revolutionary War was 94,105, but now it is only 79,759, a decrease of 14,346. Other situations such as burned houses and damaged property are impossible to count. For example, in Xijiang Township, Fifth District of Chaling, 844 civilian houses were completely burned down in 1928. In Yongxin, a total of 1,992 houses were burned or dismantled for use as blockhouses, and a total of 110,947 mu of land were seized by landlords; in the three districts of Shiqiao, Huaizhong, and Poyang alone, farmers were retroactively charged a total of 33,591 dan of grain rent. In eleven townships of Youxian County, a total of 3,469 livestock were lost. In Anren County, on average, there is only one head of cattle for every three households. In addition, due to killings, conscription, exorbitant taxes, and farmer flight, the situation of abandoned farmland is also very serious. For example, in the four districts of Poyang, Litian, Shiqiao, and Huaizhong in Yongxin County, there are a total of 18,494 mu of abandoned farmland. In Yangwang Township, Sixth District of Youxian County, abandoned farmland reaches 5,273 mu. In Zhoupi and other five townships in the Third District of Chaling, abandoned farmland reaches 3,617 mu. In Fuxing Village, Yanglao Township, Anren, abandoned farmland in one village alone exceeds 200 mu.

    The Kuomintang bandits' methods of persecuting the people were even more cruel and vicious to the extreme. Their slogans for killing people were "Clip the wings of birds that fly by, cut off the horns of dragons that come, turn stones into ashes," "Rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go," "Kill anyone you see, burn any house you see, and even stones must be cut with a knife." The names of the tortures used included "locking the neck bone," "stepping on the stick," "ascending the quick pleasure bench," "pressing the pole," "ascending the weighing rod," "roasting with incense," and "opening the abdomen and breaking the belly." Gu Meiqing, Secretary of the Leiyang County District Committee of the Communist Party of China, was repeatedly stabbed with bayonets by the bandits before his execution, and his head was stabbed into a paste. Yin Shisheng, Secretary of Fuchong Township, Chaling, had his belly cut open, his heart dug out and soaked in wine for the bandits to eat. Liu Duanzai, a farmer in Shipo Township, Chaling, who provided intelligence work for the revolution, was dismembered into four pieces when he was killed; the bandits also cut off his head and displayed it to the public for three days, and then returned the head to his wife, forcing her to hang it in the main room of her house, and also forcing her to pay forty silver dollars for the "manual labor" of beheading. In addition, the bandits robbed property, but they did not do it themselves, they made you pick it up yourself, and followed along with you. Other kinds of oppression, exploitation, and exorbitant taxes are too numerous to mention here.

    However, the people of the old revolutionary base areas, who had been directly educated by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, were not intimidated, conquered, or exterminated. Under the leadership of the Party, they carried out an extremely tenacious struggle against the enemy armed to the teeth, and severely struck at the enemy's ferocity. They sent their children, fathers, brothers, and husbands to join the Red Army in large numbers, and overcame various serious difficulties to actively support the Red Army and protect the revolutionary regime. In the struggle, they wrote countless earth-shattering and moving historical facts. For example, after the May 21st Incident in 1927, Zhu Zihe, a martyr who led the peasant movement in Lingxian County, was arrested. The bandits forced him to confess his organizational relationships, but he refused to utter a word. The bandits first tied him up in the county for people to "visit" and let the landlord despots insult him at will. Later, during the formal interrogation, the bandits interrogated and tortured him at the same time, placing a red-hot iron pot on his head, making him kneel on red-hot fire bricks, and constantly pouring cold water on the fire bricks to make the steam rise, scorching the skin all over his body. But the martyr did not yield, he gritted his teeth and did not utter a word. The bandits were at a loss and said to him, "Are you a piece of wood?" Only then did he answer a sentence, he said: "I am not wood, I am iron, I am steel, I am a Communist Party member!" Ouyang Dexi, a martyr of the Eighth Regiment of Chaling, was working in a certain mountain area in October 1931 when he was surrounded by reactionaries. He used a wooden board as a weapon, killed two enemies with guns, and wounded four enemies. He himself was hit by more than thirty bullets before he gloriously sacrificed. Chen Meilian, a martyr of Hukou Township, Chaling, had her brother Chen Chuzai nailed to the stage by reactionaries for carrying out revolutionary activities. In order to avenge her brother and for the success of the revolutionary cause, Chen Meilian persisted in guerrilla warfare for twelve whole years, and finally he was also arrested and heroically sacrificed. Before his execution, he shouted: "Long live the Communist Party of China!"

    During the time of visiting the old revolutionary base areas, we heard many similar stories every day. They ignited the flames of our hatred for the enemy! And the feelings of infinite admiration and gratitude for the heroes! Today, on the free land of the motherland,朵朵朵朵blooms everywhere, and these鲜花鮮花鲜花鮮花鲜花flowers are all watered by the鮮血鮮血鮮血blood of countless martyrs; mixed with the鮮血鮮血鮮血blood of the people of the old revolutionary base areas. III. The people of the old revolutionary base areas, who have regained their liberation, are actively rebuilding their homes, which were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits, under the leadership and with the great help of governments at all levels. After unremitting efforts, and after movements such as rent reduction, anti-hegemony, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, production has gradually recovered, the people's lives have gradually improved, and a new atmosphere has emerged in every household in the countryside. Yongxin's agriculture increased by 6% in 1950, and this year's early rice may increase by 15%; more than 15,000 mu of wasteland have been opened up in the past two years, and the income from wasteland reclamation is estimated to be more than 3 million jin of rice. Chaling's agricultural plan for this year is to increase production by 6% compared to last year, with an increase of 20 jin per mu. Before liberation, farmers in Lingxian County lacked food for an average of two or three months each year, and some people even slept in coffins covered with straw raincoats in cold weather; now they have food to eat and clothes to wear, and the phenomenon of begging from door to door has been basically eliminated. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the Sixth District of Youxian County mostly ate thin porridge or sweet potato residue all year round before liberation, and even picked wild grass to survive in famine years; now most of them have rice to eat, and life is getting better day by day. The people are full of confidence in a future of abundant food and clothing.

    Because the people of the old revolutionary base areas suffered very deeply from the devastation of the Kuomintang bandits, it is therefore an important task to further help them restore production and improve their lives. The local people's government should formulate a plan to help them solve their difficulties and rebuild the revolutionary paradise in a step-by-step manner.

    The people of the old revolutionary base areas, who have experienced the long-term and cruel rule of the Kuomintang bandits, cherish the fruits of revolutionary victory especially, and they will never allow any reactionaries or imperialists to enslave them again. Therefore, in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, they carried out movements such as joining the army, donating airplanes and cannons, and signing patriotic covenants with the same enthusiasm as when they actively participated in the revolution in those years. The plans for joining the army in Yongxin, Ninggang, and other counties were overfulfilled at the county representative conferences. Everywhere fathers sent their sons and wives sent their husbands, a magnificent picture! Every household signed patriotic covenants, guaranteeing the tasks of increasing production, donating, giving preferential treatment, paying grain, and paying taxes. The people of all counties have also completed or overfulfilled the plans for donating airplanes and cannons.

    The people of the old revolutionary base areas support and love their leader Chairman Mao. When they learned that Chairman Mao was concerned about them and had sent representatives to visit them, they were overjoyed! Wherever the visiting group went, it was greeted with unparalleled warmth by the local people, and some even traveled dozens of miles over mountains and ridges to see "the people sent by Chairman Mao." They had long been lined up several miles outside the suburbs, waiting for the arrival of the visiting group. Yangko teams and dragon lanterns connected for two or three miles. Singing "The East is Red" and "Ode to Mao Zedong" all the way, the visiting group was surrounded by gongs and drums into the county town. The scene in the county town was even more熱火朝天tumultuous, the sound of firecrackers was deafening, every household hung national flags, and slogans such as "Thank you for Chairman Mao's concern" were posted everywhere. They all said that this was the second grand occasion since liberation (the first was the celebration of liberation). People from all over offered the best local products to the visiting group to take to Chairman Mao, and wrote letters to Chairman Mao. When the visiting group left, they lined up to see them off, reluctant to part. The sincere feelings of the people of the old revolutionary base areas for Chairman Mao are moving!

    After this visit, the people of the old revolutionary base areas further recognized their glory, and everyone said that they would actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Yuan Fujiao, the female township head of Yaoqi Township, Chaling, said: "Chairman Mao cares about us so much, we must do a good job in production to answer him!" Under her leadership, the county quickly established eleven water-drawing teams when there was a drought, with a total of more than 560 people, saving more than 1,200 mu of rice fields. Huaxi Township, Yongxin, mobilized 6,720 men and women to form more than 320 water-drawing mutual aid groups, rescuing 3,640 mu of dry land in eight days. The parents and younger brother of Tang Ciling, a martyr's family member in Laozao Township, Youxian County, all sacrificed for the revolution. After receiving the gifts sent by Chairman Mao this time, he stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: "I will follow the Communist Party forever, respond to all the government's calls, go into the water, go into the fire, and fear nothing!"

    These are the great and glorious people of the old revolutionary base areas!

　　访问湘赣边老根据地
    朱学范
    一今年八、九月间，我参加了中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团，访问了湘赣边老根据地。计在各地工作三十余日，接触了数十万老根据地和老游击区的人民。这次访问给予我的印象是极深刻的。
    湘赣边老根据地包括江西西南部及湖南东南部，在罗霄山脉的中段，井冈山便在境内遂川、宁冈、永新、酃县等县之间；是第二次国内革命战争时期毛主席亲手建立的最早的革命根据地，是中国人民革命的发源地。这些根据地建立以后，中国共产党就和这里的人民取得了密切的联系，并在这些地方建立革命政权，组织革命军队，训练革命人材，实行土地改革，考验了党的各项政策，取得了革命斗争的丰富经验，为以后的全国革命胜利打下了坚实的基础。同时，这里的人民在毛主席和共产党的教育下，认清了只有坚决跟着毛主席和共产党走，才能够翻身。因此，他们发挥了高度的革命精神和爱国热情，与残暴的国民党匪帮进行了长期艰苦的革命斗争，打过了无数次的仗，得到过无数次的胜利。红军北上以后，国民党匪帮，封建势力，地主恶霸曾对这里的人民进行了疯狂的烧杀，但人民绝不屈服，坚持了游击战争和其他各种形式的革命斗争，一直到全国解放。在残酷的革命战争中，人民牺牲了无数生命，遭受了无比的摧残，但也锻炼出无数革命人材，创造出无数可歌可泣的史实。老根据地人民对于革命事业作了伟大的贡献，应该受到全国人民的热爱和尊敬！二和老根据地人民谈话时，他们会以极大的仇恨向你诉说在国民党匪帮统治时期所受的严重的摧残和损害；也会激动地告诉你许多英勇的共产党员和人民与敌人斗争的英雄事迹。
    国民党匪帮曾对这里的人民实行了所谓“三光”政策。据直接和间接了解：茶陵全县被杀的革命工作者和人民，就有两万数千人；以第四区为例，该区有上尧、下尧、洮江等六个乡，合计被杀的人民有一千一百人。郴州分区单登记的老烈属就有十三万五千多户，其中百分之五十以上都已无后代。酃县第四区石洲里乡大院，原有三百六十户，共千余人，现仅剩七十五户，共二百四十八人。耒阳“三大屠夫”段子维、谭斗才、李济坤所杀的革命工作者和人民，就在三千人以上。宁冈全县在第一次国内革命战争以前，原有人口十三万人，现仅剩三万五千人。永新县鄱阳、澧田、石桥、怀忠四区，第一次国内革命战争时原有人口九万四千一百○五人，现只有七万九千七百五十九人，减少了一万四千三百四十六人。其他如烧毁房屋、损坏财产的情形更是无法统计。如茶陵第五区溪江乡民房八百四十四间，一九二八年曾被全部烧光。永新被烧或拆作碉堡的房屋，共一千九百九十二栋，被地主夺去的土地共十一万○九百四十七亩；仅石桥、怀忠、鄱阳三区，农民被倒算谷租共三万三千五百九十一担。茶陵第四区上严乡原有茶山六十里，被烧毁五十四里，过去每年出产茶籽约一万担，榨油六万斤，其中二万斤可供外销；现在每年只出产一千担，榨油六千斤，连本地消费还不够。攸县十一个乡，损失牲畜共三千四百六十九头。安仁全县现在平均都是三户才有一头耕牛。此外由于杀戮、抓丁、苛捐杂税、农民逃亡等原因，荒芜田园的情形也很严重。如永新县、鄱阳、澧田、石桥、怀忠四区，共荒田一万八千四百九十四亩。攸县第六区洋网乡，荒田达五千二百七十三亩。茶陵第三区洲陂等五个乡，荒田共达三千六百一十七亩。安仁羊老乡福星村一村的荒田，即在二百亩以上。
    国民党匪帮残害人民的手段，更是凶狠毒辣到万分。他们杀人的口号是“鸟过剪翼，龙来切角，石头成灰”，“宁肯错杀一千，不肯放走一个”，“见人杀，见屋烧，见了石头也要过过刀”。所用酷刑名目，有“锁颈骨”、“下踩棍”、“上快活凳”、“压杠子”、“上称杆”、“香火煨”、“开肠破肚”等。中共耒阳县区委书记谷枚青临刑时被匪帮用梭镖反复刺戳，头部被戳成肉酱。茶陵芙冲乡秘书尹释生被匪帮剖开肚子、挖出心脏泡酒吃。茶陵石波乡农民刘端仔为革命作情报工作，被杀时身体支解为四块；匪帮并切下他的头来，示众三天后，把头还给他的老婆，要她悬在自己屋里客堂上，还逼着她缴付四十块光洋的杀头手工钱。此外如匪帮抢劫财物，他们不动手，要你自己挑起，连人一齐跟着走。其他种种压迫剥削，苛捐杂税，此处难以尽书。
    但是，直接受过毛主席和共产党教育的老根据地人民，没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝。在党的领导下，他们与武装到牙齿的敌人进行了无比顽强的斗争，狠狠地打击了敌人的凶焰。他们大批地送了自己的子女、父兄和丈夫去参加红军，并克服了各种严重的困难，积极支援红军，保护革命政权。在斗争中，写下了无数页惊天动地、可歌可泣的史实。如一九二七年马日事变后，领导酃县农民运动的朱子和烈士生前被捕后，匪帮逼他供认组织关系，他不肯吐一字。匪帮先把他绑在县里，让人们去“参观”，并让地主恶霸尽情侮辱他。后来正式审讯，匪帮边审边动刑，给他头上顶起烧红的铁锅，膝下跪着烧红的火砖，又不断在火砖上加泼冷水，让蒸气上腾，炙得他浑身皮肤尽脱。但是烈士没有屈服，他咬紧牙齿，没吐出一个字。匪帮无计可施了，对他说：“你是不是木头啊？”他这才回答了一句话，他说：“我不是木头，我是铁，是钢，是共产党员！”茶陵八团烈士欧阳德喜，一九三一年十月间在某山地工作，被反动派围住，他用一块木板做武器，打死了两个持枪的敌人，还打伤了四个敌人，他自己身中三十多发子弹后，才光荣牺牲。茶陵湖口乡烈士陈梅莲的哥哥陈初仔，因为进行革命活动，被反动派用铁钉钉死在戏台上。陈梅莲为了替哥哥报仇，为了革命事业的成功，坚持游击战争整整十二年，最后他也被捕壮烈牺牲。临刑前他高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”
    在访问老根据地的时间里，每天我们听到许多类似的故事。它们燃烧起我们对敌人仇恨的火焰！对英雄们无限崇敬与感激的感情！今天祖国自由的大地上，开遍了朵朵的鲜花，这些鲜花都是无数先烈的鲜血浇灌出来的；其中和着老根据地人民的鲜血。三重新获得了解放的老根据地人民，在各级人民政府的领导与大力帮助下，正积极重建曾被国民党匪帮毁灭了的家园。经过不断的努力，并经过减租、反霸、土地改革及镇压反革命等运动后，生产已渐渐恢复，人民生活已逐步得到改善，农村里家家户户出现了新气象。永新一九五○年农业增产了百分之六，今年单早稻可能增产百分之十五；两年来开了荒田一万五千余亩，开荒收益估计在三百万斤稻谷以上。茶陵农业今年计划比去年增产百分之六，一亩田增产二十斤。酃县解放前，农民每年平均缺粮两三个月，冷天甚至有人身盖蓑衣睡在棺材里；现在他们已有饭吃、有衣穿，基本上消灭了沿门乞讨的现象。攸县第六区的贫雇农，解放前大多数一年四季吃稀饭或红薯渣，荒年甚至摘食野草度日；现在大多数已有大米吃，日子一天天好过了。人民对于未来丰衣足食的生活充满了信心。
    由于老根据地人民所受的国民党匪帮的摧残十分深重，因此，如何进一步帮助他们恢复生产，改善生活，是一项重要的工作。当地人民政府应该定出计划，以便有步骤地帮助他们解决困难，重建革命的乐园。
    经历过国民党匪帮长期残酷统治的老根据地人民，格外珍惜革命胜利的果实，他们绝不允许任何反动派和帝国主义再来奴役他们。因此，在抗美援朝运动中，他们以当年积极参加革命的同样热情，轰轰烈烈地进行了参军、捐献飞机大炮及订立爱国公约等运动。永新、宁冈等县的参军计划，在县的代表会议上就超额完成了。到处父送子，妻送郎，一幅壮伟图画！家家户户订立了爱国公约，保证了增产，捐献，优抚，完粮，纳税等任务。各县人民捐献飞机大炮运动，也都完成了或超额完成了计划。
    老根据地人民拥护和热爱自己的领袖毛主席。当他们知道毛主席关怀着他们，派了代表来访问他们的时候，都高兴得了不得！访问团所到各地，必受到当地人民无比热烈的欢迎，有远从数十里外翻山越岭赶来看看“毛主席派来的人”的。他们老早就列队鹄候在郊外数里的地方，迎候访问团到来。秧歌队、龙灯接上两三里路长。一路唱起“东方红”
    “歌颂毛泽东”的歌子，锣鼓喧天地簇拥着访问团的人进入县城。县城里景象更是热火朝天，爆竹声震耳欲聋，家家户户悬挂国旗，到处贴着“感谢毛主席的关怀”等标语。他们都说这是解放以来的第二次盛况（第一次是庆祝解放）。各地人民都献出当地最好的土产，托访问团带给毛主席，并纷纷给毛主席写了信。访问团离开时，他们又必列队远送，依依不舍。老根据地人民热爱毛主席的真挚的感情，是令人感动的！
    经过这次访问，老根据地人民进一步认识了自己的光荣，人人表示要积极地响应毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的号召。茶陵腰陂乡女乡长袁富娇说：“毛主席这样关心我们，我们一定要搞好生产来回答他老人家！”在她的带动下，全县在天旱时很快地成立了十一个车水队，共五百六十多人，救活了一千二百多亩稻田。永新花溪乡动员了男女六千七百二十人，组成三百二十多个车水互助组，八天中抢救了旱田三千六百四十亩。攸县老漕乡烈属唐慈龄的父母和弟弟都为革命牺牲了，这次他领到了毛主席送的礼品后，站在毛主席的像前庄严地宣誓：“我要永远跟着共产党走，响应政府的一切号召，水里去，火里去，什么也不怕！”
    这就是伟大的、光荣的老根据地人民！
