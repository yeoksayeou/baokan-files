　　Saving Time and Accelerating Vehicle Turnover
    National Train Speed Increases
    The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has stipulated that the national railways will implement the winter train schedule from November 21st. Due to the increased work efficiency of various railway departments, the new train schedule shows significant progress in all aspects compared to the summer train schedule. The average travel speed of passenger trains nationwide has increased by 2.3 kilometers per hour, saving 341 passenger cars; the average travel speed of freight trains has increased by 2.4 kilometers per hour, saving the country 1,200 operational cars per day. The travel time of direct trains has generally been shortened. For example, the travel time of trains 1 and 2 between Beijing and Manchuria has been shortened by seven hours and forty-six minutes; between Beijing and Hankou by four hours and thirteen minutes; between Beijing and Shanghai by one hour and thirty-six minutes; and between Shanghai and Guangzhou by three hours and thirty-two minutes. After the train schedule adjustment, the departure time of general direct trains will be after 7:30 am, and the arrival time will be before 10:00 pm.

　　节省时间加速车辆周转
    全国火车运行速度提高
    中央人民政府铁道部规定全国铁路从十一月二十一日起施行冬季火车时刻表。由于铁路各部门工作效率提高，新的行车时刻表与夏季行车时刻表比较，各方面都有显著进步。全国旅客列车的旅行速度平均每小时提高二点三公里，比过去可以节省客车三百四十一辆；货物列车的旅行速度平均每小时提高二点四公里，每天可为国家节省一千二百辆运用车。直达列车的旅行时间普遍缩短。如北京满洲里间一、二次列车旅行时间缩短了七小时四十六分；北京、汉口间缩短四小时十三分；北京、上海间缩短一小时三十六分；上海广州间缩短三小时三十二分。火车时刻调整之后，一般直达列车开车时间均在上午七点半以后，到达时间均在晚上十点钟以前。
