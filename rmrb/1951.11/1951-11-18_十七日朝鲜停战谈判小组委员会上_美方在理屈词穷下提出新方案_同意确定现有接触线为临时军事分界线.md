　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 17th: At the Korean armistice negotiation subcommittee meeting on the morning of November 17th, our representative pointed out that our three proposals of November 10th fully complied with the provisions of the agenda agreed upon by both sides, were fair and reasonable to both sides, and should be quickly adopted by the subcommittee. Our proposal insisted on immediately determining the existing actual line of contact as the military demarcation line based on the principle of ceasefire in place, and clearly stipulated that the military demarcation line should be revised according to changes in the actual line of contact after the entire armistice agreement was agreed upon. The other side's plan on November 11th, refusing to immediately determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, was a direct violation of the second item on the agenda and was therefore completely unacceptable. At the meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, the other side proposed a new plan, suggesting that the subcommittee determine the existing line of contact as the temporary military demarcation line, with the lines two kilometers on each side of it as the northern and southern edges of the temporary demilitarized zone. If the armistice agreement could be signed within 30 days after this plan was adopted by the delegation conference, this temporary military demarcation line and demilitarized zone would take effect; otherwise, the line of contact at that time would be the new temporary military demarcation line. The subcommittee meeting is scheduled to continue at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th.

　　十七日朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上
    美方在理屈词穷下提出新方案
    同意确定现有接触线为临时军事分界线 【新华社开城十七日电】十一月十七日上午朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，我方代表指出：我们的十一月十日的三项建议完全符合于双方所协议的议程的规定，对双方都公平合理，应该为小组委员会所迅速通过。我方建议坚持根据就地停战原则即行确定现有实际接触线为军事分界线，并明白规定在停战协议全部商定后军事分界线按照实际接触线所发生的变化加以修正。对方十一月十一日的方案，拒绝即行确定军事分界线和非军事区是直接违反了第二项议程的规定，因而是完全不能接受的。十七日下午会上，对方提出新方案，建议由小组委员会确定现有接触线为临时军事分界线，以其两侧各二公里之线为临时非军事区的南北缘，如在这一方案为代表团大会通过后的三十天内停战协议得以签订，此项临时军事分界线及非军事区即将生效，否则则以届时的接触线为新的临时军事分界线。小组会议定于十八日上午十一时继续举行。
