Oppose Corruption and Waste, Oppose Bureaucracy!
    Editor's note: The following letters reflect the serious situation of some units' staff engaging in corruption and waste, and being irresponsible towards the lives and property of the people. The root cause of this situation is the bureaucracy of the leading cadres of various units. Relevant departments must impose due punishment on all personnel responsible for the loss of people's lives and property caused by bureaucracy. It is entirely necessary for the organs of Zhangjiakou City to conduct investigations into corruption and waste, and for the city's People's Court to sentence four cadres guilty of corruption.

    反对贪污浪费，反对官僚主义！
    编者按：这里发表的几封来信，反映了某些单位工作人员贪污浪费，对人民生命财产不负责任的严重情况。这种情况的造成，归根结底还是因为各个单位领导干部的官僚主义。有关部门必须对因官僚主义而造成人民生命财产损失的一切负责人员予以应得的惩处。张家口市各机关进行了对贪污浪费的检查，该市人民法院并对四个有贪污罪行的干部作了判处，这是完全必要的。
