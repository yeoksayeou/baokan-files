    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th: According to TASS, the German people are intensifying their struggle against remilitarization to protest Adenauer's recent secret talks in Paris with the United States, Britain, and France, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Rome.

    The German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization issued a declaration on the 24th, calling on all workers in West Germany to strengthen their struggle against remilitarization and war in response to Adenauer's secret talks in Paris. It also called on the West German people to do everything possible to realize the proposals of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic for convening an all-German conference and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty, and to strive for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The declaration stated: "At this crucial moment, the German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization calls on all peace-loving people to form a united front against all war preparations. Every peace-loving German must protest against the conferences held by war plotters in Rome and Paris. We must not allow Germany to be turned into a battlefield and German youth to be sacrificed for foreign interests."

    One hundred and twenty-one West German trade union workers recently jointly published an open letter, calling on all members of the West German trade union to take united action and work together to guarantee peace and to democratize the West German trade union. The letter expressed strong opposition to the disastrous consequences of the arms expansion policy on the people's living standards. The letter specifically pointed out that the right-wing leadership of the trade union is a traitorous organization, and called on everyone to oppose its conspiracies. The entire workforce of many enterprises in West Germany have issued statements expressing their response to this call.

    Mass rallies against remilitarization and demanding German reunification are constantly being held throughout West Germany. On October 31st, a mass rally attended by two thousand people was held in Demos, protesting remilitarization and demanding an all-German conference. On November 9th, a similar rally was held in Leverkusen, where a declaration was adopted saying: "We are determined to use all our strength to facilitate all-German negotiations." In Mannheim, three hundred and twenty West German young men and women swore that they would vigorously oppose any attempt at remilitarization. They also wrote to the chairman of the Bonn Parliament, saying that they would disregard any orders to conscript them into military service, and demanded immediate all-German negotiations to restore German unity.

    西德人民反对重新军国主义化
    抗议阿登纳和美英法在巴黎秘密谈判 【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国人民正在加紧反对重新军国主义化的斗争，以抗议阿登纳最近在巴黎和美、英、法三国所举行的秘密谈判，和在罗马举行的北大西洋公约理事会会议。
    德国工人反对重新军国主义化委员会在二十四日发表宣言，号召西德所有的工人加强反对重新军国主义化和战争的斗争，以回答阿登纳在巴黎所进行的秘密会谈，并号召西德人民尽一切力量来争取实现德意志民主共和国人民议会关于召开全德会议与加速缔结和约的建议，并争取缔结五大国和平公约。宣言说：“在这个决定性的时刻，德国工人反对重新军国主义化委员会号召所有爱好和平的人民组成统一阵线，反对一切战争准备。每一个爱好和平的德国人一定要对战争阴谋家在罗马和巴黎举行的会议提出抗议。决不能允许把德国变成战场和使德国青年为外国的利益而牺牲。”
    一百二十一名西德工会工作者在最近联名发表公开信，呼吁西德工会全体会员统一行动，同心协力为保证和平，为使西德工会民主化而斗争。信中对扩充军备政策对于人民生活水平所造成的恶果，表示坚决抗议，信中特别指出，工会右翼领导机构是叛徒的机构，并号召大家反对它的阴谋。西德许多企业的全体工人都发表了声明，表示响应这个号召。
    在西德各地，不断有反对重新军国主义化、要求德国统一的群众大会举行。十月三十一日，在德的摩尔举行了两千人参加的群众大会，抗议重新军国主义化和要求召开全德会议。十一月九日，在勒维尔库森举行了同样的大会，大会通过宣言说：“我们已决心用一切力量来促成全德谈判。”在曼海姆，有三百二十名西德男女青年宣誓说，他们将大力反对任何重新军国主义化的企图。他们还写信给波恩议会主席说，他们将对任何征召服兵役的命令置之不理，信中并要求立即举行恢复德国统一的全德谈判。
