The Crystallization of Advanced Soviet Experience
——A Record of the Growing and Strengthening of the China Changchun Railway
Hong Liu, Li Zhilun, Qian Mingjing

The Sino-Soviet joint venture, the China Changchun Railway Company, is an enterprise that has been most systematically and completely run well through the application of advanced Soviet experience. The 1951 collective contract signed by the China Changchun Railway Company most centrally embodies the basic spirit of advanced Soviet enterprise management experience.

A significant characteristic of this contract is its emphasis on the training of cadres. Soviet experts often say, "People are the most valuable asset of the country!" According to the contract, Soviet experts trained a total of 5,000 outstanding cadres for China Changchun Railway in the nine months from January to September this year, and also trained 50,000 incumbent cadres. From January to July this year, more than 2,000 technical cadres have been promoted in the China Changchun Railway as a result of training. Yuzupov, the Soviet expert and director of the Wage and Working Hours Department of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, insisted on teaching while ill in order to train talents for our country. The specialized talents in wage and working hours that he trained are not only all over China's railways, but also include cadres from many other state-owned enterprise departments in China. In the past year and a half, more than 90 study groups from railway departments and other enterprises, totaling nearly 4,000 people, have come to the China Changchun Railway to study.

Twenty-five articles of the collective contract are about specific measures to ensure the implementation of the economic accounting system. Under the specific guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, the departments of the China Changchun Railway Administration have promoted more than 100 kinds of advanced Soviet experiences in technology and labor organization in the past year or so. The chalk shunting method and train arrival forecasting system to accelerate vehicle turnover, the 500-day car-kilometer movement and over-axle movement to improve locomotive utilization efficiency, as well as the winter road maintenance method and bridge maintenance method in terms of engineering, the communication and signal joint work area and integrated household calling method in terms of telecommunications, and the Kovalev working method in terms of factory affairs, etc., are the most important parts of the advanced Soviet experience. The implementation of this series of advanced experiences has given the China Changchun Railway a new look, which has not only greatly improved the utilization efficiency of locomotives and vehicles, but also reduced transportation costs. For example, the turnover time of vehicles from the first loading to the next loading was 2.67 days when the China Changchun Railway Bureau was established, but it has been reduced to an average of only 2.16 days in the first nine months of this year. The mileage of each locomotive running for 24 hours was 358.9 kilometers at the highest when the China Changchun Railway Bureau was established, increased to 363.8 kilometers in January this year, and reached 462.6 kilometers in August. The number of locomotive over-axles was 12,404 from January to August this year, which transported more than 2,252,000 tons of goods for the country, making the China Changchun Railway Bureau exceed the annual loading task by more than 20,000 cars by the end of September. The China Changchun Railway Bureau basically completed its annual planned profit by the end of July.

Due to the acceptance of a series of advanced Soviet experiences, 63 units in the China Changchun Railway have now implemented a complete economic accounting system.

Due to the in-depth implementation of the economic accounting system, the turnover of working capital in the China Changchun Railway Bureau has been greatly accelerated. Comparing the first quarter with the third quarter of this year, the turnover rate of working capital of the Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau accelerated from once every 212 days to once every 86 days; the capital turnover rate of the Shenyang Sub-bureau accelerated from once every 207 days to once every 94 days; and the Dalian Sub-bureau also accelerated from once every 393 days to once every 94 days.

Many clauses in the collective contract are about improving the welfare and safety equipment of employees. Soviet experts attach great importance to this. Grunichev, the deputy director of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, often goes deep into factories, sections, and stations to check this situation. Once, he saw that the smoke exhaust device in the locomotive depot of the Harbin Locomotive Depot was not good, and there was a lot of smoke. Many workers working in the depot suffered from respiratory diseases and coughed frequently. He immediately ordered the Soviet experts in the section to find a way to improve the situation. After returning to the administration, he discussed the matter with many Soviet experts in the bureau. One day, when the smoke exhaust device was solved, Grunichev immediately called Zhang Xueke, the director of the political department of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, and went to the locomotive depot with him to congratulate him. The Soviet experts used their serious and responsible actions to help the administrative side of the China Changchun Railway Bureau fully implement the labor protection clauses in the collective contract, and solved the needs of employees for work clothes and protective tools. This year, the China Changchun Railway Bureau has completed the major repair project of 62,000 square meters of employee housing, reaching 112 percent of the annual plan. Other welfare facilities such as bathrooms, toilets, and drinking water wells have all met the requirements of the contract.

The Soviet experts' high degree of concern and responsibility for the interests of the country and the workers is most prominently reflected in the following event: In August this year, a train was parked on the tracks of the Manzhouli Station of the China Changchun Railway, and two Chinese workers were inspecting and repairing the wheels. At this time, a section of the carriage of another train next to it was derailed. The derailed carriage was sliding towards it, and the situation was very critical. If the two trains collided, there would inevitably be casualties and serious damage to state property. The stationmaster on duty at the station, the Soviet expert Bovaelyev, disregarded his own life safety at this time and took a tamping rod to forcefully jam the sliding vehicle. The carriage vibrated due to the obstruction, and the door was shaken open, hitting Bovaelyev on the forehead. His forehead was broken, and a lot of blood flowed out. He also fell to the ground and fainted for several hours. He was later treated in the hospital for several months. Bovaelyev's great spirit of internationalism is deeply imprinted in the hearts of the workers of the China Changchun Railway.

    苏联先进经验的结晶
    ——记在成长和壮大中的中国长春铁路
    洪流、李致伦、钱明镜
    中苏合办的中国长春铁路公司是我国最有系统地最完备地运用苏联先进经验而办好了的一个企业。中长铁路公司签订的一九五一年度的集体合同，最集中地表现出了苏联管理企业的先进经验的基本精神。
    这个合同的一个很大的特点是十分重视对干部的培养工作。苏联专家常说：“人是国家最宝贵的财富！”按照合同的规定，今年一月至九月的九个月期间，苏联专家在中长路为我国共培养了优秀干部五千人，另外又训练了五万个现职干部。从今年一月至七月，中长路因受培养而被提拔的技术干部已有两千余人。中长路局工资工时处处长苏联专家尤苏坡夫为了替我国培养人材，带病坚持教课。经他所培养的工资工时问题方面的专门人材，不仅遍及我国铁路，而且还有我国其他许多国营企业部门的干部，一年半来，来中长路学习的铁路部门及其他企业的学习团已达九十多个，近四千人。
    集体合同有二十五条是关于保证贯彻经济核算制的具体办法。在苏联专家的具体指导与帮助下，一年多来，中国长春铁路管理局各部门推行了一百余种技术方面的和劳动组织方面的苏联先进经验。为了加速车辆周转的粉笔调车法和列车到达预报制，为了提高机车运用效率的五百日车公里运动和超轴运动，以及工务方面的冬季养路法、桥梁保养法，电务方面的通信、信号联合工区、集户呼唤法，厂务方面的郭瓦廖夫工作方法等等，就是苏联先进经验中最主要的部分。这一系列先进经验实施的结果，使中长路面貌焕然一新，不仅大大提高了机车车辆的运用效率，并且降低了运输成本。如车辆从第一次装货到下次再装货的周转时间，中长路局成立时为二·六七天，今年前九个月已减少到平均只要二·一六天。每台机车二十四小时运行的里程，中长路局成立时最高为三五八·九公里，今年一月份，提高到三六三·八公里，到八月份，就已达到四六二·六公里。机车超轴的次数，今年一月至八月即有一万二千四百零四次，共为国家多运了二百二十五万二千多吨货物，使中长路局到九月末已超过全年装车任务两万多车。中长路局全年的计划利润，在七月底已基本上完成了。
    由于接受了一系列的苏联先进经验，现在中长路已有六十三个单位实行了完全的经济核算制。
    由于经济核算制的深入贯彻，中长路局流动资金的周转大大加速。以今年第一季度和第三季度比较，牡丹江铁路分局流动资金的周转速度由二百一十二天周转一次加速到八十六天周转一次；沈阳分局的资金周转速度由二百零七天周转一次加速到九十四天周转一次；大连分局也由三百九十三天周转一次加速到九十四天周转一次。
    集体合同中有很多条款是关于改善职工生活福利和安全设备的。苏联专家对这一点十分重视。中长路局副局长格鲁尼切夫经常深入到厂、段、站去检查这方面的情形。有一次，他看到哈尔滨机务段的机车库排烟装置不好，烟很大，有很多在库内工作的工人得了呼吸器官的病，经常咳嗽。他立刻命令该段的苏联专家想办法改善这种情况。他回到管理局后又和许多局里的苏联专家研究这件事。一天，当排烟装置解决后，格鲁尼切夫就立刻打电话告诉中长路局政治部主任张学轲，和他一起去机务段道贺。苏联专家就是以自己的这种认真负责的行动帮助了中长路局行政方面全部履行了集体合同中有关劳动保护方面的条款，解决了职工的工作服和防护工具的需要。今年中长路局已完成了六万二千平方公尺的职工住宅大修工程，达到全年计划的百分之一百一十二。其他如浴室、厕所、饮水井等福利设施都已达到合同的要求。
    苏联专家对于国家和工人利益的高度关心和负责精神，最突出地表现在这样一件事上面：今年八月间，中长铁路满洲里车站股道上正停着一列车，有两个中国的工人弟兄在检修车轮。这时，它邻近的另一列车发生了一节车厢脱钩的事故。脱钩的车箱正向它溜来，情势已很危急。万一两车相撞，必将发生人的伤亡和国家财产遭受严重损失的事故。该站值班站长苏联专家包华略也夫这时就不顾自己生命危险，拿一根捣棒子去用力卡住了那一节溜过来的车辆。车厢因受阻而震动，车门震开了，正打中在包华略也夫的额上。他的前额被打破了，流出许多血，人也摔倒了，昏过去了几小时。后来在医院里治疗了几个月。包华略也夫的这种伟大的国际主义精神，深深地留在中国长春铁路工人的心里。
