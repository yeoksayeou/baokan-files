　　Jin Wanxuan, Deputy Director of Anshan City Health Bureau
    Severely Embezzled and Wasted Funds, Received Demotion
    Jin Wanxuan, Deputy Director of the Anshan City People's Government Health Bureau, illegally embezzled and wasted state property. The Anshan City People's Government People's Supervision Committee has demoted Jin Wanxuan.
    Jin Wanxuan, of old army origin, joined the revolution in 1937. In 1949, when he served as the director of the Liaodong Provincial Agricultural Implement Factory, he had illegally misappropriated public funds. After March 1950, he was transferred to the Anshan City People's Government Health Bureau as Deputy Director, and engaged in more illegal acts, dereliction of duty, embezzlement, and corruption. Jin Wanxuan used his position as Deputy Director of the Health Bureau to arbitrarily obtain valuable medicines, taking medicines worth more than 149 million yuan in total; he also took Chinese medicines from private pharmacies without authorization, totaling more than 34 million yuan. He once took three pounds each of "glucose" and the expensive sugar-containing "Busheng" for his children to eat as toys. He also privately sold public property such as radios, bicycle tires, cotton, and cloth. In one transportation task, Jin Wanxuan made excessive budget estimates, reporting 2,000 carrying baskets and 5,000 shovels when only 50 of each were needed.
    Jin Wanxuan often said: "When I work, I have to find places where spending money is easy"; "No one will say I'm embezzling if I spend a few bucks"; and he believed that "a responsible cadre, spending ten or twenty million is nothing." Jin Wanxuan's serious illegal activities had a very bad influence on the masses. In order to enforce discipline, the Anshan City People's Government People's Supervision Committee inspected Jin Wanxuan's illegal and undisciplined behavior in February of this year, and demoted Jin Wanxuan in July, recovering all the funds he embezzled during his tenure as Deputy Director.

　　鞍山市卫生局副局长金万选
    严重贪污浪费已受撤职处分
    鞍山市人民政府卫生局副局长金万选违法贪污、浪费国家资财，鞍山市人民政府人民监察委员会已予金万选以撤职处分。
    金万选，旧军人出身，一九三七年参加革命。一九四九年任辽东省立农具工厂厂长时，曾有过挪用公款的非法行为。一九五○年三月以后，调任鞍山市人民政府卫生局任副局长，更违法渎职，贪污腐化。金万选利用卫生局副局长的职权，任意领取贵重药品，前后取药共值一亿四千九百余万元；向私营药房擅取中药，前后共值三千四百多万元。他曾把“葡萄糖”和贵重的含糖“布圣”各取三磅，给他的小孩吃着玩。又私自出卖公家的收音机、自行车胎、棉花、布匹等。在某次运输工作中，金万选滥做预算，本来只需要铁锹、抬筐各五十个，他却造报两千个抬筐、五千把铁锹。
    金万选常说：“我做工作，得找花钱随便的地方”；“花几个钱，谁也不会说我贪污”；并且认为“一个负责干部，花个千把万没有什么”。金万选的严重的非法行为，在群众中造成极坏影响。为了严肃纪律，鞍山市人民政府人民监察委员会于今年二月间检查了金万选的违法乱纪行为，并于七月间予金万选以撤职处分，其在副局长任内所贪污的款项全部追还。             中央人民监察委员会通讯组
