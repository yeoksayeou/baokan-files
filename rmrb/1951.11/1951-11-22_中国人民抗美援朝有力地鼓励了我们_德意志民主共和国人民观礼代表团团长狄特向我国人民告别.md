    Editor's Note: Adolf Dieth, head of the People's Delegation from the German Democratic Republic, who was invited to participate in China's National Day celebrations, made a written statement to bid farewell to the Chinese people before leaving Beijing to return to his country. The following is the full text of the written statement.
    We, the representatives of the German Democratic Republic, were graciously invited by six major people's organizations of China to participate in the grand celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and then visited many cities and rural areas. This is an experience we will never forget.
    Unforgettable was that evening when we were permitted to convey the respect of our people to Chairman Mao Zedong, and he shook hands with us. Before we set out to return to our country, we would like to express our gratitude to the Chinese government, to the six major people's organizations that invited us and gave us the opportunity to come to China, and to all the Chinese people for their boundless friendship.
    In China, we not only gained much knowledge, but also learned a lot for the struggle to win the unity of our country and world peace. We have visited many cities and rural areas, and we have spoken with workers and peasants, women and youth, writers, artists and students in their respective workplaces. The Chinese people have been liberated from years of oppression, have stood up, and are determined to oppose American imperialism and defend the victories they have won.
    People often asked us about everything in Germany, about the rearmament of West Germany, about how Germany will achieve reunification, about our construction, about the completion of economic plans, and about the work of our model workers. Everywhere we felt the strong friendship between us, which united the people and governments of our two countries in carrying out democratic construction, especially in the common struggle for peace.
    Our meeting with representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from Korea and going to the Korean front was a powerful encouragement to us to fight even harder in our own country for the happy lives of our people. In the struggle against American aggression and aid to Korea, the Chinese people are standing on the front lines. The working people are fully supporting the People's Government and the glorious Chinese Communist Party. Under their leadership, workers and peasants are advancing on the road to socialism. The strong love for Chairman Mao Zedong permeates all cities, rural areas, and factories in China.
    The German delegation clearly saw that the implementation of the land reform and the Trade Union Law, the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the implementation of the Marriage Law, and the stabilization of prices have eliminated all kinds of unreasonable phenomena in Chinese society. Workers and peasants enjoy the fruits of their labor. Precisely because of this, we felt the workers' firm will to strive for new heights in their work achievements. We saw how model workers increased productivity by improving work efficiency and making suggestions for improvement; how peasants increased agricultural production in support of their government. The North China Rural and Urban Materials Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin made it even clearer to us how industry and agriculture, workers and peasants, overcame all difficulties in solid unity.
    China is not only working and fighting for itself, but also defending world peace. In this struggle, we and the soldiers of the world peace camp are closely united under the leadership of the great socialist Soviet Union.
    After returning to our country, our delegation will report on the work and achievements of the Chinese people, their incomparably great strength, and their confidence in victory, so that our people will be encouraged and gain more strength in the struggle for unity and peace.
    We deeply thank our hosts for their warm hospitality.
    We wish the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong and the People's Government even greater achievements in construction or in the struggle to defend peace in the third year of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    中国人民抗美援朝有力地鼓励了我们
    德意志民主共和国人民观礼代表团团长狄特向我国人民告别
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节庆祝典礼的德意志民主共和国人民观礼代表团团长阿道夫·狄特离北京返国前夕，发表书面谈话，向我国人民告别。下面是书面谈话的全文。
    承中国六大人民团体的盛意邀请，我们德意志民主共和国的代表们来此参加了中华人民共和国成立二周年的国庆盛典，接着并到许多城市和农村去参观访问，这对于我们是一个永远不能忘怀的经历。
    不能忘怀的是那个晚上，当我们被允许将我国人民的敬意带给毛泽东主席，他和我们握手的时候。在我们起程回国以前，我们要向中国政府，向邀请我们并给我们以机会来到中国的六大人民团体，向全中国人民表示我们对他们所给予我们的无尽的友谊的感谢之忱。
    在中国，我们不但增长了许多见识，而且对于争取我们祖国的统一和世界和平的斗争来说，我们也学到了许多东西。我们访问过许多城市和农村，我们曾和在自己工作岗位上的工人与农民、妇女与青年、作家、艺术家与学生们谈过话。中国人民已经从多年的压迫下解放出来，已经站立起来，并且决心反对美国帝国主义，保卫自己争取得来的胜利。
    人们常常问到我们关于德国的一切，关于西德的重新武装，关于德国怎样实现统一，关于我们的建设，关于经济计划的完成，关于我们劳动模范们的工作。到处我们都感觉到我们之间的坚固的友谊，它把我们两国人民和两国政府在进行民主建设，特别是在进行争取和平的共同斗争中团结了起来。
    我们和由朝鲜归来的以及将到朝鲜前线去的中国人民志愿军代表们的会面，对于我们是一种有力的鼓励，鼓励我们在自己国内更多地为我国人民的幸福生活而斗争。在抗美援朝的斗争中，中国人民站在最前线。劳动人民以全力支持人民政府和光荣的中国共产党。在它们的领导下，工人和农民踏着走向社会主义的道路前进。对毛泽东主席的强烈的爱戴，弥漫在中国各城市、农村和工厂中。
    德国代表团清楚地看到：土地改革和工会法的贯彻执行，劳动保险条例的公布，婚姻法的实施和物价的稳定，肃清了中国社会上的种种不合理现象。工人和农民享受着自己工作的果实。正因为这样，我们在工人那里感觉到他们争取新的高度的工作成绩的坚决意志。我们看见：劳动模范们怎样为增加生产而提高工作效率，并怎样提出改良建议；农民们怎样为拥护他们的政府而提高农业生产。天津的华北区城乡物资交流展览会使我们更加清楚地了解：工业和农业，工人和农民们怎样在巩固的团结中克服了一切困难。
    中国不仅在为自己而工作和战斗，同时也保卫了世界的和平。在这个斗争中，我们和全世界和平阵营的战士们紧紧地团结在伟大的社会主义苏联的领导之下。
    我们代表团回国以后将报道中国人民的工作和成就，他们的伟大无比的力量以及对胜利的信心，借使我国人民在争取统一与和平的斗争中得到鼓励，得到更多的力量。
    我们深深地感谢热情招待我们的主人们。
    我们预祝中国人民、毛泽东主席和人民政府在中华人民共和国成立的第三年内，在建设上或保卫和平的斗争中获得更大的成就。
