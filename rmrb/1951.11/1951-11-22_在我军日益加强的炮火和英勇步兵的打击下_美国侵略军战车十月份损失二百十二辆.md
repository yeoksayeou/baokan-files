Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st. Our frontline correspondent reports: Under the heavy blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the number of tanks lost by the American aggressor troops and their accomplice armies has increased sharply. According to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of September to September 30th, the American aggressor troops lost 68 tanks. In the month from the beginning of October to October 31st, during the first and second rounds of Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," the number of tanks lost by the American aggressor troops surged to 212.

During the "Autumn Offensive," the American aggressor troops' tanks were not only destroyed by the Korean-Chinese People's forces during combat, but also frequently destroyed by the fierce artillery fire and other anti-tank weapons of the Korean-Chinese People's forces while the tanks were moving on the roads or cowering behind the positions. This is a new and serious blow that our army has inflicted on the aggressor troops' tanks since the enemy launched the "Autumn Offensive."

An anti-tank artillery platoon of a certain unit of the Volunteers guarding a frontline position in the eastern part of the central front destroyed 28 enemy tanks in a few days. Hu Lian, a gunner in the platoon, destroyed one tank with four shells on the first day, and destroyed three tanks with only three shells on the second day. Li Shouqing, the squad leader of the platoon, destroyed four tanks with five shells.

Once, several enemy tanks were moving north along a road in the eastern part of the central front. One of them suddenly exploded - an anti-tank grenade flying from near the road hit it. The other three hurriedly turned around and fled, but one of them ran into a landmine on the way back and was almost blown over. Since then, the enemy in this area has suffered from "shock disease," and the enemy's tanks cower around the positions, daring not to venture out easily.

One night, twelve tanks were parked on a road several kilometers behind a certain American aggressor troops' position, and eight American soldiers in charge of guarding were roasting fire not far from the tanks. Suddenly, six tanks emitted thunderous explosions, and a fire broke out immediately, scaring the eight American soldiers to roll and crawl aside to hide. After a while, the enemy fired small cannons, machine guns, and rifles at the direction of the burning tanks. The ones who attacked these tanks by surprise were Kim Bin-sung, the squad leader of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, and his comrades Heo Sang-nam and Chai Yi-jong. They had quickly returned to their positions when the enemy retaliated.

Due to the increasingly low morale of the aggressor troops, Van Fleet had to concentrate a large number of tanks, airplanes, and artillery to support infantry operations during the "Autumn Offensive." However, under the intensified artillery fire and the brave and resourceful infantry attacks of the Korean-Chinese People's forces, the aggressor troops' tanks, infantry, airplanes, and artillery suffered heavy losses.

    在我军日益加强的炮火和英勇步兵的打击下
    美国侵略军战车十月份损失二百十二辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社前线记者报道：在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军沉重的打击下，美国侵略军及其帮凶军战车的损失数字，急剧增加。据不完全统计，自九月初至九月三十日止，美国侵略军损失了六十八辆战车；而在十月初至十月三十一日的一个月内，即在范佛里特“秋季攻势”的第一、二两个回合中间，美国侵略军战车损失的数字，便激增到二百一十二辆。
    美国侵略军的战车在“秋季攻势”中，不仅在作战时被朝中人民部队击毁，就是当战车还在公路上行进或者还龟缩在阵地后方时，也常常被朝中人民部队的猛烈炮火和其他各种反战车武器所击毁。这是在敌人发动“秋季攻势”以后，我军所给予侵略军战车新的严重的打击。
    守卫在中线东部一个前沿阵地上的志愿军某部反战车炮兵排，在几天内就击毁了二十八辆敌军战车。该排炮手胡琏第一天用四发炮弹击毁了一辆战车，第二天仅用三发炮弹就击毁了三辆。该排班长李守清并用五发炮弹击毁了四辆。
    有一次，有几辆敌人的战车沿着中线东部的一条公路向北开动，有一辆突然爆炸——从公路附近飞来的反战车手雷击中了它。其余三辆慌忙回头逃跑，但有一辆在归路上，又碰上了地雷，几乎被炸得倒翻过来。自此以后，在该地区的敌人便患上了“吃惊病”，敌人的战车龟缩在阵地周围，再不敢轻易出动。
    在一个深夜里，某处美国侵略军阵地后方数公里外的一条公路上，停放着十二辆战车，八个负责警卫的美国兵，正在离战车不远处烤火。突然有六辆战车发出霹雳般的巨响，顿时烧起大火，吓得那八个美国兵连滚带爬地躲到一旁去了。好一会，敌人才用小炮、机枪和步枪向着燃烧起战车的方向射击。奇袭这些战车的是朝鲜人民军某部班长金宾成和他的战友许相南、柴怡宗三个人。他们在敌人还击的时候，便已迅速地走回了自己的阵地。
    由于侵略军士气日益低落，范佛里特在“秋季攻势”中，不得不大量地集中战车、飞机和大炮来支持步兵作战。但是在朝中人民部队日益加强的炮火和英勇机智的步兵的打击下，侵略军的战车和步兵、飞机、大炮一样遭受了惨重的损失。
