The self-criticism of Guo Huanmin, head of the Judicial Section of Sui County:

　　I was transferred to the position of head of the Judicial Section of Sui County in May 1949. At that time, there were only two people in the Judicial Section: myself and Comrade Chen Zhaochang (staff member), who had just come from the army. In the past, we were unfamiliar with this work and had little experience. We made a bureaucratic mistake in handling the case of Liang Anshi being brutally murdered. The self-criticism is as follows:

　　Liang Anshi’s husband's family lived in Shaopen Li Village, Fourth District of our county. This case occurred on the night of the third day of the seventh lunar month in 1949. Initially, Comrade Xuan Yuanzunyan, Deputy District Chief of the Fourth District, examined the body. Xuan Yuanzunyan's handling of the case was very perfunctory, which aroused the dissatisfaction of Liang Anshi's family, who requested a re-examination. However, Comrade Xuan Yuanzunyan did not reply. It was not until the fifth day, after the An family filed a complaint, that the county government learned of the case. The section immediately sent staff member Comrade Chen Zhaochang to examine the body. When the comrade arrived at the Fourth District government, the sun had already set, and he was unable to conduct the examination. The next morning, he went to Shaopen Li Village with comrades from the District government to examine the body. On the way, they met several village cadres who were going to the district to report that "the body had already decayed and had been placed in a coffin, and the stench was unbearable, making it impossible to examine." Comrade Chen Zhaochang had no knowledge of forensic examination, and immediately believed them without examining the body or investigating the village. He returned to the county to report on the burial issue. He has now made a self-criticism for failing to complete the task assigned to him by the superior. However, after this case occurred, I did not conduct an in-depth investigation in the villages, and only lightly believed the report from the district cadres (the report did not mention that Liang Anshi’s vagina had been punctured), and I was convinced that Liang Anshi had hanged herself, so I relaxed on this case. This caused An Chongshan’s dissatisfaction. Whenever An Chongshan filed a complaint, he was always arrogant, and we thought An Chongshan was a professional litigant and did not want to pay attention to him. This was also wrong. Later, when An Chongshan and Liang Wangshi (i.e., Liang Anshi’s mother-in-law) confronted each other, An Chongshan’s attitude remained the same, failing to comply with the interrogation order, confronting the government, and making crazy statements. At the time, we had no choice but to detain An Chongshan. This shows that during the interrogation, we did not distinguish between right and wrong, and did not properly comfort the plaintiff, but rather used force and suppression, which was a deviation. Later, after Liang Yongshi and his mother confessed, we did not make a judgment and transferred the case to the Shangqiu Branch of the Henan Provincial People’s Court (because several people from the Shangqiu Branch participated in the interrogation at the time). This was the idea of ​​shirking responsibility.

　　In summary, our handling of this case was so sloppy, perfunctory, and irresponsible to the people that a deep self-criticism is warranted. The error in handling the Liang Anshi case was not only a lesson for me personally, but also a wake-up call for all cadres in the county. Since then, whenever a tragic case occurs, I personally go to the scene of the incident for repeated examinations and investigations, and conduct detailed interrogations, correcting the attitude of blindly engaging in work and being irresponsible.

    睢县司法科科长郭唤民的检讨
    我于一九四九年五月调任睢县司法科科长。当时司法科只有我和刚从部队中下来的陈兆昌同志（科员）二人。过去我们对这一工作生疏，经验很少，在处理梁安氏被惨杀案中犯了官僚主义的错误。现检讨如下。
　梁安氏夫家在我县四区烧盆李村。该案发生在一九四九年古历后七月初三夜里。起初先经第四区副区长轩辕尊言同志检验尸体。轩辕尊言因处理此案非常潦草，引起梁安氏娘家人的不满，要求复验。但轩辕尊言同志未予答复。延至五日，经安家控诉，县府才获知此案。本科当即派科员陈兆昌同志前往验尸。该同志走到四区区政府时，太阳已落，未及检验。次晨偕同区政府的同志前往烧盆李村验尸。行至中途，遇该村村干部等数人赴区报告，称：“尸体业已腐烂，现已入殓，臭气难闻，无法勘验。”陈兆昌同志素无验尸常识，当即轻信，未经勘验，也未到该村调查，即回县汇报，研究埋葬问题，他因没有完成上级交给他的任务，现已作了检讨。但此案发生后，我没有深入乡村调查，只轻信区干部汇报（汇报中未谈到梁安氏阴户被扎之事），便确信梁安氏是吊死的，所以对此案就放松了。这样引起安崇山的不满。安崇山每逢告状即盛气凌人，我等以为安崇山系官司油子，不愿理他。这也是不对的。嗣后安崇山与梁王氏（即梁安氏的婆母）对质的时候，安崇山的态度依然如故，不遵守审讯秩序，与政府对抗，发言疯狂。当时无奈，遂将安崇山扣押。由此看出我们在审讯时，没有分清黑白，很好地给原告以适当安慰，而是以武力威胁、压制，是有偏差的。后来把梁永诗母子讯出口供，没有作出判决，即移交河南省人民法院商邱分院（因当时有商邱分院数人参加审讯），这是推出门不管的思想。
    综上所述，处理此案时，如此粗枝大叶，潦草从事，对人民不负责，我们作一深刻的检讨是应该的。由于处理梁安氏案的错误，不但给我本人一次教训，对全县干部也是敲了一次警钟。自此以后，每有惨案发生，即亲至出事地点反复地勘验调查，细致地审讯，纠正了盲目从事和不负责任的态度。
