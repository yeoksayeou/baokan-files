    What I Saw of American Air Force Captives

    Editor: In late August, a unit of the People's Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft artillery shot down an American B-29 bomber. Five American airmen who parachuted down were captured by our unit.

    The confessions of the captives fully exposed the nature of the invading army and their low morale. Staff Sergeant Dean Baugher, a machine gunner, said: "I came here on government orders. I was drafted and don't know why we are fighting." Staff Sergeant ক্লিন Brown, a radio operator, said: "I was drafted when the war started. I have been on 'errands' fifteen times, and each time I hoped it would be the last so I could go home..."

    They knew from our broadcasts about our policy of treating prisoners leniently. After being captured, each of them took out a square silk cloth with something printed on it in Chinese, Korean, English, and Japanese by the U.S. military authorities. The gist of it was that they were pilots of the "United Nations Forces," and now they had been captured, please treat them leniently and release them to go home. The day after being captured, ক্লিন Brown, navigator Lieutenant Robert Brown, and radar observer Lieutenant Bill, all wrote letters home asking us to forward them. Robert said in his letter to his mother: "...We are now in the hands of the Chinese, and they are treating us very well, giving us food, shelter, and cigarettes... We are very lucky that we have a chance to go home." ক্লিন Brown said in his letter to his mother: "We are looking forward to going home soon to live a happy life, and let you and I pray together for peace!"

    This is the truth about American soldiers, the truth about the "powerful and superior air force" boasted by American warmongers.

    我看到的美国空军俘虏
    编辑同志：八月底，人民志愿军高射炮部队某部同志击毁了一架美国B—29型轰炸机。五个跳伞降落的美国空军人员被我部俘获了。
    在俘虏们的供认中，十足暴露了侵略军队的本质和他们低落的士气。机枪射手鼎·褒尔上士说：“我是政府命令来的。我被征入伍，不知道为什么要打仗。”无线电报务员克林·布朗上士说：“战争开始时，我才被征入伍。我‘出差’了十五次，每次都很希望这是最后一次，完了就可以回家。……”
    他们从我们的广播中知道了我们宽待俘虏的政策。被俘后每人就拿出一张方块绸面，上面是美军当局印制的中、朝、英、日四国语言的东西，大意是说他们是“联合国军”的飞行员，现在已经被俘，请宽待他们，并释放回家。被俘后第二天，克林·布朗、领航罗伯尔特·布朗中尉和雷达观测员比尔中尉，都写了家信请我们转交。罗伯尔特给他母亲的信中说：“……我们现在中国人手中，他们待我们特别好，给我们食物、住处和烟卷……我们真幸运，我们有机会回家了。”克林·布朗给他母亲的信中说：“我们很盼望早日回家过幸福的生活，让你和我一起为和平而祈祷吧！”
    这就是美国士兵的真相，美国战争贩子们所夸耀的“强大的优势空军”的真相。
