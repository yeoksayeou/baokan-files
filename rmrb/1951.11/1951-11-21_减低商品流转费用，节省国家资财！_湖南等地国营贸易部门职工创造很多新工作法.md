Reduce Commodity Circulation Costs, Save State Assets!
Workers in State-Owned Trading Departments in Hunan and Other Places Create Many New Working Methods

Workers in some state-owned trading departments in Hunan, Shandong, Shanghai, and other places are actively studying their business and improving their work methods, which has initially reduced commodity circulation costs and saved a lot of wealth for the country.

When receiving the 1950 fiscal grain allocation, the Hengyang Grain Company implemented the "receiving in warehouse" method. This new method is: the Grain Bureau organizes the masses delivering public grain to send the public grain directly to the collection units (trade companies), reducing the handling fees of the Grain Bureau transferring it to the trade companies. The company also adopted the "selling in warehouse" method, that is, the sales unit (trade company) fills out the form and directly picks up the goods from the Grain Bureau, which eliminates the need for warehousing fees. In the past, when the company transferred grain out, it first transported it by boat to the warehouse next to the Yuehan Wharf Railway Station on the east bank of the Yangtze River, packed it into bags, and then loaded it onto the train. After research by the employees, it was changed to packing on the boat and transporting it to the station to load the train, saving 67.96 million yuan in handling fees. When the Shaoyang Grain Branch received the 1950 fiscal grain, it adopted the "local sales" method, which not only expanded the sales market and facilitated farmers, but also saved more than 300 million yuan in commodity circulation costs. Other branches such as Xiangtan, Changde, and Yiyang also adopted advanced working methods such as "mutual allocation," "one-time ship loading," and "combining transfer and purchase with receiving fiscal grain," saving the state 2 billion yuan.

Employees of the Shipping Section of the China National Import and Export Corporation Shanghai Branch adopted the "original car transfer" method, which enabled a large number of imported materials to be quickly transferred to other places by train and reduced commodity circulation costs. To transfer goods, customs clearance procedures must be completed. After the goods arrive at the port, they are first transported from the station to the warehouse. After the procedures are completed, they are transported from the warehouse to the station, and then loaded onto the train to be transported to other places. Such complicated procedures not only made the goods easily damaged, but also reduced the transportation speed and increased the commodity circulation costs. After the section adopted the "original car transfer" method (that is, after being inspected by the customs at the station, the original car is transferred or the car is changed and transferred on the spot), the shipping work can truly be done: "fast, safe, accurate, and cost-effective." It has saved the country 120 million yuan.

Employees of the China Coal and Construction Corporation Qingdao Branch adopted the whole-car delivery method in the patriotic competition. When coal is transported to the station, the user (usually a larger fixed user) is notified to pick up the goods at the station, saving 10,425 yuan per ton of coal for shunting fees, unloading fees, weighing fees, handling fees, and loss fees.

The storage and transportation personnel and loading workers of the Xinji Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch of Hebei Province improved the loading technology and reduced costs. In October, they overfulfilled the transportation task by 67.5%, saving 17,216,100 yuan in freight. The new loading method they implemented is: when loading a 30-ton car, pack five rows flat on the first layer, seven bags in each row. The second layer is loaded upright on both sides, twelve bags on each side, and two rows are loaded upright with the large side in the middle, seven bags in each row, and three rows are loaded upright with the small side on top of these two rows, seven bags in each row, for a total of 59 bags in this layer. The third layer is loaded horizontally with the large side, two rows, twelve bags in each row, for a total of 24 bags. The fourth layer is loaded flat with the large side, twelve bags, for a total of 130 bags in the entire car. This method loads fifteen more bags per car than in September and twenty more bags per car than in January. (Comprehensive report from this newspaper)

    减低商品流转费用，节省国家资财！
    湖南等地国营贸易部门职工创造很多新工作法
    湖南、山东、上海等地部分国营贸易部门职工，积极钻研业务，改进工作方法，已初步减低商品流转费用，为国家节约了大量财富。
    衡阳粮食公司在接收一九五○年财政拨粮时，实行了“就仓接收”的办法。这种新办法是：由粮食局组织缴粮群众，把公粮直接送交代收单位（贸易公司），减少了粮食局拨交贸易公司的搬运费。该公司还采用了“就仓销售”的办法，即由代销单位（贸易公司）填单，直接向粮食局提货，这就免除了倒仓费。该公司外调粮食，过去是先用船运到江东岸粤汉码头火车站旁的仓库，装包后再装到车上。经职工研究，改为就船装包运站装车，节省搬运费六千七百九十六万元。邵阳粮食分公司接收一九五○年财政粮时，采取“就地销售”办法，不仅扩大了销售市场，便利了农民，而且节省了三亿余元商品流转费用。其他各地如湘潭、常德、益阳等分公司，采用“互相对拨”“一次装船”和“调运结合收购及接收财政粮”等先进工作方法，为国家节省了二十亿元。
    中国进出口公司上海分公司报运科职工，采用“原车过轨”方法，使大量进口物资，能迅速转车运往别处，并且减低了商品流转费用。转运物资要办理报关手续，物资到埠后，先从车站运到仓库，等办好手续，再从仓库运到车站，然后再装车运往别处，这样多的手续，不但使物资容易损坏，而且减低了运输速度，增加了商品的流转费用。该科采用“原车过轨”法（即在车站经海关检查后，当场原车转出或换车转出）后，使报运工作真正做到：“迅速、安全、正确、省费。”已为国家节省了一亿二千万元。
    中国煤建公司青岛分公司职工，在爱国主义竞赛中，采取了整车交货方法，煤炭运到站时，即通知用户（一般是较大的固定用户）在车站提货，每吨煤可节省调车费、卸车费、过磅费、搬运费、损耗费一万零四百二十五元。
    河北省辛集花纱布支公司储运人员与装车工人，改进装车技术，减低了成本，十月份超额完成运输任务百分之六十七点五，节省运费一千七百二十一万六千一百元。他们实行的新装车法是：装三十吨车时，在第一层平装五行，每行七包。第二层两边立装，每边十二包，中间大面平竖装两行，每行七包，在此两行上面再小面竖装三行，每行七包，此层共装五十九包。第三层大面平横装两行，每行十二包，计二十四包。第四层大面平装十二包，全车共装一百三十包。这种方法，每车比九月份多装十五包，比一月份多装二十包。（本报综合）
