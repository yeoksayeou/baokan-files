    Taiyuan Jinsheng Yarn Factory, Liu Wenchang Group
    Creates New Lap Winding Method
    The Liu Wenchang group in the combing workshop of the Taiyuan Jinsheng Yarn Factory has created a new method of lap winding. The main features of the new lap winding method are mastering the operating rules of the carding machine and the rational use of labor. This method can shorten the stopping time for lap winding per carding machine from an average of four minutes and twenty-four seconds in the past to two minutes. Calculated on the basis of each machine working twenty-four hours a day, it can increase the production of cotton sliver by 9.48 pounds. After this method was promoted in the factory, the entire factory can increase the production of cotton sliver by 426.6 pounds per day, which can supply the needs of more than 330 spindles. This creation is of great significance in the current production increase and economy campaign. According to surveys, the stopping time of each lap winding machine across the country is generally more than three or four minutes. Calculated according to the existing equipment in the country, if everyone learns the lap winding method of the Liu Wenchang group, it will be equivalent to increasing the production of 750 carding machines, supplying the needs of more than 160,000 spindles.

    太原晋生纱厂柳文昌小组
    创造新抄车工作法
    太原晋生纱厂梳棉间柳文昌小组创造了新的抄车工作法。新抄车法的主要特点是掌握了钢丝车的运转规律和合理地使用了劳动力。此一方法可使每台钢丝车抄车的停车时间由过去平均四分二十四秒缩短到两分钟。以每台车每日工作二十四小时计算，即可增产九·四八磅棉条。这一方法在该厂推广后，全厂每天就能增产棉条四百二十六点六磅，可多供给三百三十多个纱锭的需要。此一创造在目前增产节约运动中有重要意义。据调查，全国各地每部抄车停车时间一般均在三、四分钟以上。按全国现有设备计算，如果都学会柳文昌小组的抄车工作法，将等于增加了七百五十部梳棉机的生产，以供给十六万多个纱锭的需要。
