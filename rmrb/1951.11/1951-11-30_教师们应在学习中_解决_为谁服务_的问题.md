    Teachers Should Resolve the Question of "Serving Whom" in Their Studies

    Teachers should thoroughly resolve the question of "serving whom" in this study; otherwise, the reform work of higher education institutions will be greatly hindered. This semester, Northern Jiaotong University's Tangshan Institute of Technology enrolled a large number of new students. Some teachers, seeing that their level was not good, became disheartened and said, "The students' grades are so bad that I really can't teach them. I definitely don't want to enroll students like this year in the future." They did not think from the needs of the motherland, and thus consider how to improve teaching methods, strengthen tutoring work, and improve students' level, but complained about the excessive number of enrollments and the poor level of students. If teachers do not resolve the question of "serving whom," then the future work of department and college adjustments, expanded enrollment, development of specialized courses, and training classes will be hindered.

### 教师们应在学习中  解决“为谁服务”的问题

    教师们应在学习中
    解决“为谁服务”的问题
    教师们在这次学习中应把“为谁服务”这一问题加以彻底解决，否则高等学校的改革工作将受到很大的阻碍。本学期北方交通大学唐山工学院招收了大批新生，有的教师看到他们程度不好，便心灰意懒地说：“学生的成绩这样坏，我真教不下去，以后决不要像今年这样招生了。”他们不是从祖国的需要着想，从而考虑如何改善教学方法，加强辅导工作，提高学生的水平，却埋怨招收的人数过多，学生程度不好。如果教师们不解决“为谁服务”这一问题，那末，今后院系调整、扩大招生、发展专修科和训练班等等工作是会受到阻碍的。王元良
