　　Henan Province, Weishi County Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Shi Yungui
    Shields bad elements, causing the democratic reform movement to be unable to be carried out
    Comrade Editor: Shi Yungui (Communist Party member), Chairman of the Weishi County Federation of Trade Unions in Henan Province, was deceived and enticed by bad elements, causing the democratic reform movement in Chengguan Town to be unable to be carried out for more than four months.
    Song Jinming, chairman of the Chengguan Town Carpentry and Earthwork Workers' Union, and Wu Zhijing, vice chairman, both served as squad leaders and platoon leaders in the puppet river defense team in the past. After being elected this spring, in order to flatter Shi Yungui, they forced more than 80 workers to donate money to buy bed sheets for Shi Yungui. They did not work themselves, but received more wages than the workers. They also did not allow workers to express their opinions, and groundlessly attacked Han Liu, the most honest worker, forcing Han Liu to attempt suicide. Under these circumstances, the Weishi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and cadres from other departments repeatedly suggested to the Weishi County Federation of Trade Unions that the chairman and vice chairman of the Carpentry and Earthwork Workers' Union be removed. However, Shi Yungui refused to accept everyone's suggestions. In May, after the democratic reform movement began in Chengguan Town, the workers demanded the struggle against Song Jinming and Wu Zhijing, but Shi Yungui thought that the materials presented by the masses were "all nonsense!" Seeing that the movement could not be carried out, the Weishi County Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed this issue with Shi Yungui in the Party's group meetings twice. After the first Party group meeting, Shi Yungui seemed to have changed somewhat and announced the dismissal of Song Jinming and Wu Zhijing; but two days later, he severely attacked the workers again and expelled five activists. The democratic reform movement has since become deadlocked. At the second Party group meeting, everyone re-examined the issue of the democratic reform line. Not only did Shi Yungui not humbly consider it, but he said, "I'm not doing it anymore, let me rest for a while!" and refused the Party's help.
    The mistakes made by Shi Yungui are serious, and he has lost the position of a Communist Party member. The Chenliu Sub-district Office of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Chenliu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China should promptly handle this matter.

### 河南省尉氏县总工会主席石运贵  包庇坏分子，致使民主改革运动无法开展

　　河南省尉氏县总工会主席石运贵
    包庇坏分子，致使民主改革运动无法开展
    编辑同志：河南省尉氏县总工会主席石运贵（共产党员）受坏分子蒙蔽利诱，致使城关镇民主改革运动，四个多月来无法开展。
    城关镇泥木业工会主席宋金明和副主席吴之京，过去都曾干过伪河防队班长、排长等职。他们于今年春当选后，为了要奉承石运贵，便强迫八十多名工人捐钱买被面送给石运贵。他们自己不做工，但得的工资比工人还多。他们还不许工人提意见，并无故打击最老实的工人韩留，迫得韩留要自杀。在这种情况下，中共尉氏县委和其他部门的干部一再向尉氏县总工会建议，要求撤换泥木业工会正、副主席。可是，石运贵拒绝接受大家的建议。五月间，城关镇民主改革运动开始后，工人要求斗争宋金明、吴之京，但石运贵以为群众提出的材料“都是胡扯！”中共尉氏县委眼见运动无法开展，曾先后两次在党的小组会上与石运贵讨论这个问题。第一次党的小组会后，石运贵似有所转变，并曾宣布将宋金明、吴之京两人撤职；但过了两天，却又狠狠地打击工人，开除了五名积极分子。民主改革运动从此形成僵局。在第二次党的小组会上，大家又重新研究了民主改革的路线问题，石运贵不但不虚心考虑，反而说：“我不干了，让我休息一下吧！”拒绝党的帮助。
    石运贵所犯的错误是严重的，他已丧失了一个共产党员的立场。河南省总工会陈留分区办事处和中共陈留地委纪律检查委员会应迅速处理此事。
