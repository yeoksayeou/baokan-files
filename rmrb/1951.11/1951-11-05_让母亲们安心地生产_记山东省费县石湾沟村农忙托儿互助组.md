Letting Mothers Produce with Peace of Mind
— On the Rural Busy Season Childcare Mutual Aid Group in Shiwangou Village, Feixian County, Shandong Province

Shiwangou Village is a small mountain village in Feixian County, Shandong Province, with a total of twenty-eight households and one hundred and ninety-nine people. The whole village has only two hundred and seventy-three mu of mountain land. Before liberation, due to the cruel exploitation of the landlord class, the wanton looting by the Chiang bandit army, and years of natural disasters, as many as sixteen households in the village were begging for food. After Shiwangou Village was liberated in 1948, the village organized a production self-salvation committee, and twenty-three young women also joined mutual aid groups to engage in agricultural production. But the difficulty lay in how to solve the problem of taking care of children, because if this problem was not properly solved, it would be difficult for them to participate in production with peace of mind.

The village's production self-salvation committee, based on the village's situation and the women's demands, decided to organize a busy season childcare mutual aid group. The method was to organize elderly women who could not work to look after the children during the busy farming season, so that young and middle-aged women could participate in labor; and the elderly women could also earn a certain number of work points to solve their own difficulties in production. The villagers all agreed to this exchange of labor method.

In the first year that this method was implemented, there was no calculation of work points or accounts, but only during the busy farming season did the children's mothers help the elderly women who were taking care of the children for a few days. At the end of the year, the elderly women who were taking care of the children raised the opinion that it was unreasonable not to calculate work points or accounts. So in the spring of 1950, it was stipulated that each child from one to five years old, regardless of size, would be calculated at two work points per day (eight work points counted as a full day's work). This spring, when the village launched the patriotic production increase movement, in order to enable women to better participate in agricultural labor and at the same time further advance the childcare mutual aid work, a more reasonable method than before was formulated: children from one to two years old were calculated at four work points per day each (each person can look after two); children from two to four years old were calculated at two work points per day each (each person can look after four); children over five years old can not only play by themselves, but also coax the younger ones to play, so they are not counted for work. The results of the trial implementation in this spring's busy farming season showed that everyone thought this regulation was more reasonable. The elderly women who took care of the children said, "The five-year-old children have become our assistants." The mothers used farming to exchange labor with the elderly women who took care of the children. If the farming was not enough to offset the work points, they used accumulating manure, going to the market, and doing odd jobs to make up for it: making a jacket offset two days of work; a pair of pants offset one day of work; making forty jin of pancakes offset half a day of work, etc. In this way, the principle of being beneficial to both parties was gradually realized, and the unity between the two parties was strengthened.

The houses in Shiwangou Village are very few, and the busy season childcare mutual aid group is set up in the open air: in the spring, in a sunny and sheltered place; in summer and autumn, under the shade of large trees. In addition to taking care of the children, the elderly women also take care of the threshing ground and guard the doors. During the busy farming season, the mothers send their children to the designated place every morning and afternoon, and bring boiled eggs or pancakes for the children to eat. The elderly women who take care of the children save these things and feed them to the children on time, and also cook porridge with millet and mung beans for the children to drink. In order to prevent infectious diseases, each child has a personal bowl.

Almost every child brings several small toys, such as flower rattles, trumpets, small drums, small gongs, etc. The children can play and sleep on futons woven from wheat straw or sorghum leaves. In the summer, every day at noon, the elderly women also use sun-heated water to bathe the children. So the children are very healthy. Wang, the elderly woman who takes care of the children, said to the children's mothers, "When it comes to taking care of children, please rest assured! When it comes to strenuous work, young people are stronger than us, but when it comes to taking care of children, we are more experienced than you!" In this way, the mothers with children can concentrate on working in the fields.

After the establishment of the busy season childcare mutual aid group, it solved many problems in Shiwangou Village.

First, it solved the difficulties of young and middle-aged women not being able to participate in agricultural labor. When summarizing the whole year's production during the Spring Festival this year, everyone believed that because women actively participated in agricultural labor, they had greater strength than in the past to deeply plow and meticulously cultivate, process and apply fertilizer, and thus achieved a bumper harvest.

Second, with the busy season childcare mutual aid group, the difficulties of women without labor at home in farming have also been solved. The six elderly women who take care of the children are all over sixty years old and have a total of fifteen mu of land. In the past, they had to find someone to cultivate, and because fertilization and cultivation were not timely, their annual income was not enough to maintain their lives. Now, taking Wang as an example, in 1950, thanks to the childcare mutual aid group helping her with timely cultivation, the total income of autumn grain was about one thousand five hundred and ten jin. If calculated at two jin of rice per day for consumption, she can still have a year's worth of food left over, and she no longer has to worry about food and clothing.

Third, with the busy season childcare mutual aid group, the children's lives are much happier. Li Jinglin's wife used to lock her child at home every time she went to work in the fields. One day, a dog ran into the house and bit the child, and later that young life was lost! In the past, mothers often beat and scolded their children for no reason because they were overworked and felt upset. Now the mothers all say, "We haven't seen our children all day when we're so busy, and we love them too much when we come back, how can we beat and scold them again?" This year, the children's mothers are all taking time to spin yarn, preparing to make a cloth shed for the childcare mutual aid group and put it under the shade of the trees, so that the children can live better. Since the establishment of the busy season childcare mutual aid group, the incidence of children's diseases in the village has decreased. Although there was a measles epidemic this spring, there were no accidents because of good care.

    让母亲们安心地生产
    ——记山东省费县石湾沟村农忙托儿互助组
    石湾沟村是山东省费县的一个小山庄，共有二十八户人家，一百九十九口人；全村只有二百七十三亩山地。解放前，由于地主阶级的残酷剥削，蒋匪军的肆意抢掠和连年的天灾，全村要饭的有十六户之多。一九四八年石湾沟村解放以后，村里组织了生产自救委员会，二十三个青年妇女也参加了互助小组，从事农业生产。但是困难的就在于怎样解决带孩子的问题，因为如果不很好地解决这个问题，她们是难于安心地参加生产的。
    该村生产自救委员会根据村里的情况和妇女们的要求，决定组织农忙托儿互助组，办法是在农忙时组织不能劳动的老太太看孩子，让青壮年妇女参加劳动；而老太太也可以赚到一定数量的工分，解决自己在生产上的困难。村民都同意这个换工的办法。
    这个办法开始实行的第一年，没有计工算账，只在农忙时，由孩子的母亲帮助看管孩子的老太太干几天活。年终时看孩子的老太太提出意见，认为不计工算账是不合理的。于是在一九五○年春季作了规定：每个从一岁至五岁的小孩不分大小，一律按每天两分工计算（八分工算一个整工）。今年春天，村里展开爱国丰产运动时，为了使妇女们更好地参加农业劳动，同时使托儿互助工作更向前推进一步，又订出了较前更合理的办法：一岁至二岁的每天每个算四分工（每人能看二个）；二岁至四岁的每天每个算两分工（每人能看四个）；五岁以上的孩子不但自己能玩，并且还能哄小的玩，所以不算工。在今春农忙中试行结果，大家都认为这样规定更合理了，管孩子的老太太说：“五岁的孩子都变成我们的助手了。”母亲方面就以种田来和管孩子的老太太换工，如种田顶工不足时，就用积肥、赶集和做零活来顶补：做一件褂子顶两天工；一条裤头顶一天工；做四十斤煎饼顶半天工等。这样逐渐实现了对双方有利的原则，双方的团结更加强了。
    石湾沟村的房子很少，农忙托儿互助组是设在露天的：春天在有太阳和避风的地方；夏天、秋天在大树荫下。老太太除看孩子外，还兼顾看场看门。农忙时，每天早晨和午后母亲们便把孩子送到规定的地点，并带去给孩子吃的煮鸡蛋或是煎饼。看孩子的老太太把这些东西保存起来，按时喂给孩子们吃，并且还用小米、绿豆煮些稀饭给孩子们喝。为了防止传染病，每个孩子都有一个自用的小碗。
    差不多每个孩子都带着几种小玩具，如花棒锤、喇叭、小鼓、小锣等等。孩子们可以在用麦秆或高粱叶子编成的蒲团上玩耍、睡觉。夏天，每天晌午时分，老太太还用晒热的水给孩子洗澡。所以孩子们都很健康。看孩子的王大娘对孩子的母亲说：“说起看孩子来请你们放心吧！干出力的活，青年人比俺强，讲起看孩子来，俺可比你们有经验啦！”这样，有孩子的母亲，可以专心在田间劳作了。
    农忙托儿互助组成立以后，解决了石湾沟村里不少的问题。
    第一，解决了青年、壮年妇女不能参加农业劳动的困难。今年春节总结全年生产时，大家都认为由于妇女积极参加农业劳动，比过去有更大的力量来深耕细作，加工施肥，因而获得了丰收。
    第二，有了农忙托儿互助组后，家里没有劳动力的妇女在耕种上的困难，也解决了。六个管孩子的老太太，年龄都在六十多岁，共有十五亩地，过去耕种都得找人，同时因为施肥、耕种不及时，所以每年收入不够维持生活。现在，以王大娘为例，一九五○年由于托儿互助组帮她及时耕作，秋粮的总收入约有一千五百零十斤，如以每天食用二斤米计算，还可余出一年的食粮，吃穿再不用愁了。
    第三，有了农忙托儿互助组后，孩子们的生活幸福得多了。李景林的妻子在过去每到田里干活，就把孩子锁在家里。有一天，一只狗跑进屋把孩子咬伤，后来那幼小的生命便送掉了！过去，母亲因为做活过重，心里发烦，往往无故打骂孩子。现在母亲们都说：“这么忙一天不见孩子，回来时疼都疼不过来，还能再打骂孩子么？”今年孩子们的母亲都在抽空纺纱，准备给托儿互助组做个布棚，搭在树荫下，让孩子们生活得更好。自农忙托儿互助组成立以来，村里小孩的疾病减少了，今春虽有麻疹流行，因为看管得好，没有发生意外。
