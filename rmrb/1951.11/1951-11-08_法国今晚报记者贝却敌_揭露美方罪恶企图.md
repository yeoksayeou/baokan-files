Xinhua News Agency, 7th. French "Ce Soir" reporter Béquet reported from Panmunjom on the 6th: On the morning of the 6th, I stood on a small hill within the 1,000-yard diameter safety zone of the conference site, looking towards a place less than 1,000 yards from Panmunjom, observing American tanks bombarding a village. I saw the flashes of artillery fire, and heard the whistling of the shells as they flew through the sky and landed in the village. I heard the rumble of the tanks as they advanced a few yards and then fired another barrage. They were supporting the American offensive on the east bank of the Sand River, which is their latest attempt to encircle Kaesong. This kind of military adventurism best explains what is happening inside the conference tent.

On the 6th, the Korean and Chinese representatives told the American side that their new proposal, put forward yesterday, to delay the specific determination of the military demarcation line was "unacceptable." The Korean and Chinese side pointed out that the American proposal even violated their own instructions and agenda. The agenda clearly stated that the military demarcation line must be determined "as a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea." Reaching an agreement on abstract principles does not provide a basis for further negotiations, which the American side also knows very well. This is an attempt to sabotage the meeting. If the new American attempt fails, that is, if they cannot obtain by force what they cannot obtain by negotiation—Kaesong—then they can raise the Kaesong issue at any time in the future to sabotage any other agreement that has been reached.

    揭露美方罪恶企图
    【新华社七日讯】法国“今晚报”记者贝却敌六日自板门店报道：六日早晨，我站在直径一千码的会场安全区内的小山上，向着离板门店不到一千码的地方眺望，观察美国坦克向一个村庄轰击。我看到大炮的火光，听到炮声嘶嘶地在天空飞过，落到村庄中。我听到坦克的轧轧声，它们前进几码就打一阵炮。它们是在砂川河的东岸支持美军的进攻，这是他们想要包围开城的最近一次企图。这种军事冒险主义，最能说明会议帐篷内部发生的事情。
    六日，朝中代表告诉美方说，他们昨天提出的要求延缓具体确定军事分界线的新建议，是“不能接受的”。朝中方面指出，美方的建议甚至违反了他们方面的训令和议程。议程明白地说过，必须确定军事分界线，“作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件”。就抽象的原则达成协议，并不能提供进一步谈判的基础，这是美方也很清楚地知道的。这是一种破坏会议的企图。如果美国的新企图失败了，也就是说他们不能以武力取得他们不能以谈判取得的东西——开城，那么他们以后随时都可以提出开城问题，以破坏其他任何已经达成的协议。
