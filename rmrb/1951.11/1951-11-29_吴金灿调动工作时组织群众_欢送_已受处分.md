    Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor: On August 15th, the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page published a letter criticizing Wu Jincan, the head of Xulou Township, Nanzhao District, Yingshang County, Northern Anhui. After our investigation, the situation of Wu Jincan organizing the masses, bands, and Yangko teams to provide a send-off when transferring jobs, traveling more than forty miles back and forth, wasting manpower, and affecting production is entirely true. This matter has been dealt with. Comrade Wu Jincan has made a profound self-criticism and has been given a major demerit in administrative terms. The county people's government has also circulated this matter throughout the county to educate all cadres.

    吴金灿调动工作时组织群众“欢送”已受处分
    编辑同志：八月十五日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载了批评皖北颍上县南照区徐楼乡乡长吴金灿的信件。经我们派人检查，吴金灿在调动工作时组织群众和乐队、秧歌队欢送，往返四十余里，浪费人力、影响生产的情况完全属实。此事业已作了处理。吴金灿同志已作了深刻检讨，行政方面也已给他记了大过一次。县人民政府并将此事通报全县，以教育全体干部。
