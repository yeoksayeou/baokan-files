    Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Publicizing the New Thoughts and Feelings of the People

    Along with the development of various construction undertakings in the new China, the people's thoughts are constantly advancing. Cherishing the new qualities of the people that are growing, reflecting the model actions of advanced figures, and using them to educate the people is an important task of newspapers and periodicals. The efforts made by the Liaoxi Daily in the Northeast District in this regard are noteworthy.

    From September 3rd to October 15th, in reporting on the Liaoxi Province's rescue efforts in the Liaoning River basin after the August floods, the Liaoxi Daily consecutively published twelve short news items and thirty-five short stories, focusing on reflecting the spirit of unity and mutual assistance and the heroic spirit of the people in the struggle against natural disasters, as well as the Communist Party and the People's Government's concern for the people's lives and the spirit of sharing weal and woe. The article "We Are All People of the New Country" published on September 20th vividly narrated a story from Majiafang Village, Er District, Liaozhong County. A woman named Zheng in the village was about to give birth during the flood and had her baby on the river embankment. At that time, the migrant workers from Dabaozi Village, Tai'an County, who were rescuing the embankment, found the woman and rescued her back to Dabaozi Village. The woman received warm condolences and care from the villagers. Soon, comrades from the Women's Federation of the Second District of Liaozhong County went to the village to offer condolences to the woman and express their gratitude to the villagers. The villagers said: We are all people of the new China and have a responsibility to take care of our disaster-stricken sisters; there is no need for thanks. This story demonstrated the great friendship between the people and promoted the new moral idea of the people helping each other in times of difficulty. Therefore, it received a good response among readers, and some rural reading groups requested the newspaper to publish more of this type of material.

    The experience of the Liaoxi Daily proves that reflecting the new thoughts and feelings of the people through vivid, concrete, and short texts is a vivid political education for readers and an effective way to improve the ideological content of newspapers. Lenin, in his article "On Our Newspapers," taught us: "Pay more attention to how the workers and peasants are, in fact, building new things in their daily work." This new thing also includes the new thoughts of the people. As a tool for ideological education, newspapers and periodicals should reflect the ideological changes of the people through social life phenomena in order to guide the people forward.

    报纸应注意宣扬人民群众的新的思想感情
    伴随着新中国各项建设事业的发展，人民群众的思想正不断前进。珍视正在成长着的人民群众的新品质，反映先进人物的模范行动，用以教育人民群众，这是报纸刊物的重要任务。东北区辽西日报在这方面所作的努力是值得注意的。
    从九月三日到十月十五日，辽西日报在报道辽西省抢救辽河流域八月间所遭的水灾中，连续发表了小通讯十二篇、小故事三十五篇，着重反映了在向自然灾害作斗争中人民群众的团结互助精神和英雄气概，以及共产党和人民政府对人民群众生活的关切和患难与共的精神。九月二十日该报所刊“咱们都是新国家的人民”一文，生动地叙述了辽中县二区马家房村的一个故事。该村一位姓郑的妇女，正当涨水时临产，在河堤上生了孩子。当时，台安县搭牛堡子村抢险的民工发现了这位产妇，把她救回搭牛堡子村去。这位产妇受到该村群众热情的慰问与照顾。不久，辽中县二区妇女联合会的同志到该村慰问产妇，并向该村群众致谢意。该村群众表示：咱们都是新中国的人民，有责任照顾受灾姊妹，用不着感谢。这篇故事表现了人民群众之间的伟大友爱，宣扬了人民群众患难相助的新道德思想。因此在读者中得到良好的反应，有的农村读报组曾要求该报多刊登这类材料。
    辽西日报的经验证明：通过生动、具体、短小的文字，反映人民群众的新的思想感情，是对读者的一个生动的政治教育，也是提高报纸思想性的有效办法。列宁在“论我们的报纸”一文中，曾教导我们：“多注意工农群众在事实上，在其日常工作中，怎样在建设新的东西。”这种新的东西，也包括了人民群众的新的思想。作为思想教育工具的报刊，应该透过社会生活现象，反映人民群众的思想变化，以引导人民群众前进。
