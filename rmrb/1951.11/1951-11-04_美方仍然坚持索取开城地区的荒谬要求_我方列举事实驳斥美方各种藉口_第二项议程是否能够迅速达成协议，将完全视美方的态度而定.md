Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. Our special correspondent reports: At the fifteenth session of the armistice talks' sub-group meeting held on the 2nd, the U.S. side still did not accept our reasonable plan and insisted on the absurd demand for the Kaesong area, thus hindering the rapid agreement between the two sides on the second item of the agenda. Our representative at the meeting enumerated the facts and systematically and thoroughly refuted various excuses from the other side for insisting on the absurd demand. Our representative also pointed out again: Our side has announced our reasonable plan to the world. This plan is the greatest effort made by the Korean-Chinese delegation to achieve the Korean armistice and the highest sincerity shown by our side to strive for peace in Korea. Whether the second item on the agenda can be quickly agreed upon will depend entirely on the attitude of the U.S. side.

The various excuses of the U.S. side for insisting on its absurd demands are without any factual basis and cannot withstand refutation. People who respect the facts know that Kaesong has been controlled by the Korean-Chinese People’s Army from before the start of the armistice talks until now. At that time, the U.S. side only had a few search troops on the west bank of the Imjin River. It was not until the two sides agreed to use Kaesong as the negotiation site, and the Korean-Chinese side voluntarily proposed to use Panmunjom and Sajikol Creek as the boundary line between the two sides, that the U.S. troops were able to reach the east bank of Sajikol Creek.

The absurd argument of the U.S. representative unreasonably demanding that our side withdraw from the Kaesong area is even fundamentally contradictory to the consistent argument of the U.S. side since the beginning of the negotiations. When our side initially proposed the fairest and most reasonable 38th parallel plan, the U.S. side repeatedly claimed that it was a political issue unrelated to the armistice talks. However, when the U.S. side attempted to obtain the Kaesong area, which they had failed to obtain through military force, during the negotiations, the U.S. representative put forward the absurd argument that it was necessary to maintain the pre-Korean War positions for the so-called "defense" of Seoul. When our side proposed a fair and reasonable plan to make comprehensive adjustments according to the battle lines, the U.S. side repeatedly claimed that it had no interest in any exchange of land. But when the U.S. side attempted to use negotiation methods to advance its troops to the Kaesong area, the U.S. representative absurdly demanded that scattered islands in various places be exchanged for our Kaesong area. In fact, according to our current plan, the area that our side is prepared to withdraw from has already compensated for all the areas that we require the U.S. side to withdraw from, including scattered islands. The U.S. representative insisted on demanding that our side withdraw from the Kaesong area with such unfounded and contradictory arguments, which cannot but make people doubt whether the U.S. side is sincere in quickly reaching an agreement on the second item of the agenda. The determination of the military demarcation line is a basic condition for the Korean armistice. After the Korean-Chinese delegation has made its greatest efforts and put forward this irrefutable and reasonable military demarcation line plan, the attitude of the U.S. side will be a decisive test of whether the U.S. government has sincerity in the armistice negotiations.

    美方仍然坚持索取开城地区的荒谬要求
    我方列举事实驳斥美方各种藉口
    第二项议程是否能够迅速达成协议，将完全视美方的态度而定
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者报道：在二日举行的停战谈判第十五次小组会上，美方仍然没有接受我方的合理方案，并坚持索取开城地区的荒谬要求，因而阻碍了双方在第二项议程上迅速达成协议。我方代表在会上列举事实，系统地彻底地驳斥了对方坚持荒谬要求的各种藉口。我方代表并再次指出：我方已将我方的合理方案向全世界宣布。这一方案是朝中代表团为取得朝鲜停战所作的最大努力，是我方为争取朝鲜和平所表现的最高诚意。第二项议程是否能够迅速达成协议，将完全视美方的态度而定。
    美方坚持其荒谬要求的各种藉口，是毫无事实根据、经不起一驳的。尊重事实的人都知道：开城，从停战谈判开始前到现在都是由朝中人民军队控制的。当时美方在临津江西岸仅有少数搜索部队，直到双方同意以开城为谈判地点，朝中方面自愿提出以板门店和砂川河为双方分界线后，美方部队才得以到达砂川河东岸。
    美方代表无理要求我方退出开城地区的荒谬论点，甚至和美方自从谈判开始以来的一贯论点也是根本自相矛盾的。当我方最初提出了最公平合理的三八线方案时，美方一再声称：那是与停战谈判无关的政治问题。但当美方企图在谈判中获得它们以军事力量所未能获得的开城地区时，美方代表却又提出了为了所谓“防御”汉城的必要，必须保持朝鲜战争以前的阵地的荒谬论点。当我方提出了公平合理的按照战线作全面调整的方案时，美方一再声称：对于任何土地的交换都毫无兴趣，但当美方妄图利用谈判的方法将其部队推进到开城地区时，美方代表却又荒谬地要求以分散在各地的零星的岛屿来和我方的开城地区交换。事实上按照我方目前的方案，我方所准备撤退的地区早已补偿了一切我方所要求于美方撤退的地区，包括零星的岛屿在内。美方代表竟以这种毫无根据、自相矛盾的论点，坚持要求我方撤出开城地区，这不能不使人怀疑美方是否确有诚意使第二项议程迅速达成协议。军事分界线的确定，是朝鲜停战的基本条件。在朝中代表团已作最大的努力，提出了这个无可反对的合理的军事分界线方案之后，美方的态度将是美国政府对于停战谈判是否具有诚意的决定性的考验。
