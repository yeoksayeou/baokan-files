To the Editor:
The Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the People's Court in the Central District of Beijing emphasizes formalities when handling citizen cases, refusing to accept cases without written complaints, which led to the serious consequence of Zhai Zhongting's suicide attempt.

Zhai Zhongting, female, thirty-two years old, from Penglai County, Shandong Province. Currently working at the Xin Yi Cigarette Factory. Last May, she invested 500,000 RMB in the Hua Bei Brothers Cigarette Factory. In July, after the factory started operations, she worked there for over ten days. Due to poor business, she was introduced by technician Zhang Xiaozeng to work as a temporary worker at the Xin Yi Cigarette Factory. Soon after, the Hua Bei Brothers Cigarette Factory's business improved, and she requested to return to her original factory. However, manager Chang Guichun refused and asked her to withdraw her shares. She had no choice but to withdraw. However, Chang Guichun did not immediately return her capital, delaying it for six months. Later, Chang Guichun was arrested due to a case, and Wang Quantai took over the responsibility of the factory, also delaying the matter. After repeated negotiations and urging, Zhai Zhongting only received 250,000 RMB on September 5th this year, and was told that her shares had been completely revoked. Zhai Zhongting did not agree, feeling that she was being bullied too much, and asked the local police station, Workers' Daily, and the Sixth District Workers' Union to handle the matter, but the problem was not resolved.

On the afternoon of September 7th, Zhai Zhongting, along with the defendant Wang Quantai, went to the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the People's Court in the Central District of Beijing to file a lawsuit. At that time, Su Peiyuan at the registration desk said, "To file a lawsuit, you must write a written complaint, it won't work without writing one." He also told her that someone at the Beijing People's Court could write it for her. Because Zhai Zhongting could not write and had no written complaint, she was unable to file a lawsuit at that time. Wang Quantai further provoked her with words. Feeling that the problem could not be solved, she was very disappointed and went to Beihai Park to attempt suicide by poisoning. After taking the poison, she took a car to the Hua Bei Brothers Cigarette Factory. On the way, she was discovered and sent to the hospital where she was rescued.

We believe that Zhai Zhongting's suicide attempt was caused by the Hua Bei Brothers Cigarette Factory repeatedly delaying the return of her capital, and the failure to resolve Zhai Zhongting's appeals to various parties reasonably. If the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the People's Court in the Central District of Beijing had not emphasized written complaints, accepted the case, and resolved it appropriately, Zhai Zhongting's suicide attempt could have been avoided.

The establishment of district people's courts is to facilitate the people and enable problems to be dealt with more promptly. The system of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the People's Court in the Central District of Beijing, which stipulates that cases are not accepted without written complaints, is inappropriate. This approach delays the redress of grievances for the working people. Therefore, we believe that this system should be improved.

　　北京中城区人民法院第五区审判庭
    无呈文不受理案件，造成翟中亭服毒事件
    编辑同志：北京市中城区人民法院驻第五区审判庭，受理市民案件强调手续，无呈文不受理，以致造成翟中亭自杀的严重后果。
    翟中亭，女，三十二岁，山东蓬莱县人。现在信
    一烟厂作工。去年五月，她在华北兄弟烟厂入股本人民币五十万元。七月间该厂开工后，她参加该厂工作十余天，因营业不好，经技师张效增介绍至信一烟厂作临时工。不久，华北兄弟烟厂营业好转，她要求回原厂工作。但经理畅桂春不允许，并叫她退股。她无法只好退股。但畅桂春又不把她的股本立时退还，一直拖了六个月。后来畅桂春因案被捕，该厂由王全体负责，对此事也是拖延。经她多次交涉催促，直到今年九月五日才给翟中亭二十五万元，并声言已完全撤销了她的股权。翟中亭不认可，感到欺人太甚，先后到当地派出所、工人日报及第六区职工会等处要求处理，问题也没有得到解决。
    九月七日下午，翟中亭连同被告王全体到中城区人民法院驻第五区审判庭起诉。当时该庭报到处苏培元说：“要起诉必须写呈文，不写不行。”并告诉她北京市人民法院有人可以代写。翟中亭因不会写字，又无呈文，故当时未能起诉。王全体又用话刺激她，她感到问题无法解决，非常失望，便至北海公园服毒。服毒后坐车至华北兄弟烟厂，途中被人发觉，送医院获救。
    我们认为，翟中亭服毒事件是由于华北兄弟烟厂屡次拖延不退还其股本，而翟中亭向各方申诉又得不到合理解决所造成的。假如中城区人民法院驻第五区审判庭不强调呈文，受理此案，并予以适当解决，翟中亭的自杀行为是可以避免的。
    区人民法院的设立，是为了便利人民，使问题更能及时处理。北京市中城区人民法院驻第五区审判庭规定无呈文不受理案件的制度是不适宜的。这种办法使劳动人民申冤诉苦拖延时日。所以，我们认为应当改进这种制度。
