Comrades,

The Weaving Method Conference concludes today. After twenty days of demonstration, observation, measurement, analysis, and research, we have concentrated the innovations in operating methods of weaving labor models and summarized a new set of weaving methods. This method was collectively created by weaving workers in Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, the Northeast, and other regions. We have named it the "1951 Weaving Method." This name was unanimously approved at the plenary meeting of the Weaving Method Conference on November 15th and is formally announced today. The promotion of this method will create enormous wealth for the country, powerfully helping the country develop industry, improve people's lives, and build our great motherland. We warmly celebrate the birth of the 1951 Weaving Method.

    The Arduous Creative Process

The 1951 Weaving Method was created through a period of arduous work. Before the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Method, weaving models were already using their brains and gradually improving their operating methods. Many weaving models did not produce substandard cloth or produced very little for a long time, but because we did not pay enough attention to improvements in operating methods, we failed to summarize them in a timely manner. It was not until after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Method that everyone began to pay attention to operating methods. Weaving models worked hard to learn the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Method, studied technology, and further improved their own operating methods. At the beginning of October, various regions began to summarize weaving methods, and we successively received summaries from Qingdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, the Northeast, the Northwest, Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory, Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory, Shanxi Jinhua Yarn Factory, and other places. In Qingdao, when the Hao Jianxiu Method was promoted to the cloth workshop in August, the Qingdao Textile Bureau and the Textile Trade Union formed a weaving method research committee to conduct observations and measurements in eight factories, collect the innovations of weaving models, and make summaries. Then, they concentrated weaving models from various factories in one factory to learn the new weaving method. The experience summarized in Qingdao was not only accepted by weaving models but also by the majority of weaving workers. Tianjin factories had also long summarized the operating methods of weaving models such as Wang Deshan, Jiang Shuying, and Pang Qingfu. In particular, the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, thanks to the efforts of technician He Xuekong, not only summarized Jiang Shuying's operating method but also began to promote it and achieved results in two groups. The automatic loom method in the 1951 Weaving Method is based on the summary from Qingdao, plus Pang Qingfu's familiarity with machine performance, and the individual advantages of weaving models in Tianjin, the Northeast, Shanghai, and other regions. The ordinary loom method is based on the combination of the operating methods of Jiang Shuying of Tianjin and Wang Jiande of Qingdao, plus the operating advantages of Wang Deshan, Wang Jiaxiang, Qu Yanzeng, and Shanghai weaving models. Weaving models, technicians, and staff members, using the Kovalev method, worked hard day and night for twenty days and finally gathered the operating advantages of weaving models from various places and organized them into the 1951 Weaving Method. This summary specifically embodies the combination of mental and physical labor, the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of politics and technology. The 1951 Weaving Method is a concentrated expression of various operating advantages of Chinese weaving workers and is the wealth of our country.

        Main Characteristics of the
        1951 Weaving Method

The 1951 Weaving Method is all about preventing yarn breakage, reducing substandard cloth, and increasing production efficiency. Separately, its main characteristics are three: (1) Work is regular: that is, the patrol regularity of automatic looms; the shuttle change regularity and patrol regularity of ordinary looms. After the implementation of this method, the work of weaving workers will change from passive to active, which can prevent yarn breakage and reduce substandard cloth, reduce downtime; and improve production efficiency, while also improving loom watching ability. (2) This method has certain regularity, but it also has its flexibility and can adapt to the specific conditions of each factory. For example, for watching eight ordinary looms, there are three ways to segment shuttle changes: "two large segments," "two segments with four sections," and "two segments with eight sections." The "two large segments" shuttle change method is suitable for factories with poor conditions;
    The "two segments with four sections" shuttle change method is a step forward compared to dividing into only "two large segments" and is suitable for the general situation of factories, and workers can easily accept it; the "two segments with eight sections" shuttle change method has stronger regularity than the previous two, but it must have better conditions to be implemented. (3) Be familiar with machine performance, and promptly find maintenance workers to repair any machine malfunctions.

Operating in accordance with the 1951 Weaving Method, like the Hao Jianxiu Method, work is unhurried and organized. Therefore, it is bound to be high in output, good in quality, and easy and pleasant to work. This kind of work method can be accepted by every weaving worker with the correct labor attitude. However, those who lack the correct labor attitude or sit on benches to watch the machines must first establish a correct labor attitude in order to correctly understand the benefits of the 1951 Weaving Method and apply it to their work.

        Value Created by the
        1951 Weaving Method

(1) Inevitably greatly reduce substandard cloth. If we inspect our cloth according to the standard for good cloth stipulated by the Ministry of Textile Industry, the national average substandard cloth rate is still above 4 percent, while the substandard cloth rate of the creators of the 1951 Weaving Method – the weaving models – has been below 1 percent for many years. Wang Deshan even did not produce any substandard cloth for two years, and Wang Jiande only produced one piece of substandard cloth in two years. Before learning the Hao Jianxiu Method, the average substandard cloth rate of the Wang Jiaxiang group was 2 percent; after learning the Hao Jianxiu Method, the average substandard cloth rate of the entire group in September was 0.5 percent. They achieved such results by working according to their own methods. The 1951 Weaving Method is much more complete than their respective work methods. Undoubtedly, working according to the new work method will greatly reduce substandard cloth. If we vigorously promote the 1951 Weaving Method and make the substandard cloth rate reach the level of labor models, then the wealth increased by reducing substandard cloth will be very considerable. Assuming that the national substandard cloth rate is reduced to 0.5 percent, it can increase wealth by more than 18.9 million catties of millet per year; if it is reduced to 1 percent, it can increase wealth by more than 16.2 million catties of millet per year; even if it is only reduced to 2 percent, it can increase wealth by more than 10.8 million catties of millet per year, which is equivalent to seven to twelve and a half fighter planes.

(2) Work is regular, downtime is reduced, and production efficiency is naturally improved. Until now, the average production efficiency of weaving in the country is still less than 90 percent, but the production efficiency of weaving models has reached 95 percent. Assuming that the national weaving efficiency is increased by 2 percent, the wealth created is equivalent to the value of forty fighter planes. If everyone can reach the level of weaving models, the value created will be even greater.

(3) Work is regular and planned, which saves both time and effort, and loom watching ability is naturally improved. Taking the increase in loom watching ability of the labor models attending the meeting during the measurement period as an example, those who originally watched twelve automatic looms have increased to twenty-four to thirty-two; those who originally only watched four ordinary looms have increased to eight; those who originally watched eight ordinary looms have increased to twelve. The improvement of loom watching ability provides a large number of skilled workers for the full three shifts. Improving loom watching ability naturally reduces costs.

(4) The implementation of the 1951 Weaving Method will create new and more reasonable quotas, creating conditions for wage reform and economic accounting.

    Overcome All Difficulties and Vigorously Promote
    the 1951 Weaving Method

The Hao Jianxiu Method has created a large amount of wealth for the country, and the 1951 Weaving Method can also create a large amount of wealth for the country. We should overcome all difficulties and vigorously promote it to launch a production innovation movement in textile factories.

The experience of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Method tells us: the factory leaders who have a correct understanding of the Hao Jianxiu Method and attach importance to the promotion work will achieve greater results; on the contrary, those who do not have a correct understanding of the great significance of the Hao Jianxiu Method and do not pay attention to the promotion work will achieve smaller results. The leadership of individual factories treats the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Method with a complacent attitude, and young teachers encounter difficulties in the promotion work and do not receive support from the leadership, but are instead hit. It is impossible to achieve good results in the promotion work by doing this. When promoting the 1951 Weaving Method, we will certainly encounter some difficulties, but as long as the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League in the factory have a correct understanding of the 1951 Weaving Method and attach importance to the promotion work, the difficulties can be overcome, and the 1951 Weaving Method will be smoothly promoted.

In the promotion work, we should conduct in-depth education work, break the conservative thinking of the workers and masses, and make them realize that the 1951 Weaving Method can create a large amount of wealth for the country, enhance the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to eliminate more U.S. aggressors. Implementing the 1951 Weaving Method is a practical action for our weaving workers to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift. We must improve the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers in all aspects and make them actively learn and implement the new weaving method. In terms of promotion methods, the trade union should adopt the method of focusing on breakthroughs to promote the overall situation, first achieve results in one group, use facts to convince the masses, and strive for the support of the administration or the capitalists, so as to smoothly promote the overall situation. At the beginning of the promotion work, because workers are not familiar with the new work method, output and quality may be affected, but this is temporary. After the workers become proficient, output and quality will soon improve, and the leadership should not demand immediate significant results.

Weaving is the final manufacturing process of textile production. Therefore, in order to make the promotion of the 1951 Weaving Method achieve comprehensive results, in addition to the efforts of the weaving workers, we should also do a good job in maintenance and many of the front-end tasks.

The spinning workshop should further promote the Hao Jianxiu Method, improve the quality of yarn, and reduce or even eliminate gourd yarn, feather yarn, slub yarn, high-twist yarn, weak-twist yarn, and hairy yarn. Do not rewind the yarn from doffing to loading the shuttle to reduce weft breakage caused by rewinding.

Do a good job in weaving preparation, the gauge of the yarn cleaner should be sixteen thousandths for 20-count yarn, so as to effectively remove impurities on the yarn and reduce the end breakage rate in the cloth workshop; the sizing should meet the operating standards, it should not be too dry or too wet, and the sizing rate should not be too high or too low, so as to reduce the end breakage caused by poor sizing.

Conscientiously implement the fixed supply system, fix the machines, and clarify the responsibility for substandard products.

Strengthen weaving maintenance to reduce defects caused by poor machine operation. Adjust the difference between machine operating speeds to reduce the difficulties in the work of weaving workers.

In addition, appropriately reducing the temperature and humidity of the workshop is also an important factor in reducing end breakage.

It takes effort to do the above work, but as long as the administration recognizes the importance of these tasks, conducts specific organizational work, signs contact contracts, and gives full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, it is possible to overcome all difficulties and do these tasks well.

Our work in 1951 has been very successful. Two important work methods have emerged this year. Next spring, we will hold a competition and evaluation meeting to evaluate the merits of the work in various regions in 1951. The production work for the entire year of 1952 will focus on the effective promotion and implementation of the Hao Jianxiu Method and the 1951 Weaving Method. All textile workers should include this work in their patriotic pacts, launch patriotic emulation, and strive to achieve greater victories on the textile production front in 1952. A review conference will be held in the second half of next year to check the implementation of these two work methods. It is hoped that all comrades attending the meeting will first learn these two work methods and play a leading role in the promotion.

Comrades! Chairman Mao calls on us to increase production and practice strict economy. Our promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Method and the 1951 Weaving Method is a practical action to respond to Chairman Mao's call. All textile workers in the country should work hard to learn, vigorously promote, and greatly reduce roller flowers, substandard cloth, and reclaimed silk, improve production efficiency, reduce costs, and enable the Chinese People's Volunteers and the broad masses of people to wear high-quality and low-priced cloth. Let us create a large amount of wealth for the country, develop industrial production, enhance the country's economic strength and national defense strength, strive for the final victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, improve people's lives, and build our great motherland!

    大力推广一九五一织布工作法
    响应毛主席增产节约的号召
    ——在织布工作法会议总结会上的讲话
    陈少敏同志们：
    织布工作法会议今天结束了。经过二十天的表演、观察、测定、分析、研究工作，集中了织布劳动模范们操作方法上的创造，总结出了一套新的织布工作法。这一工作法是天津、青岛、上海、东北等地区织布工人集体创造出来的，我们把它定名为“一九五一织布工作法”。这个名称已在十一月十五日织布工作法会议全体会议上一致通过，今天正式宣布。这一工作法推广后，将为国家创造巨大的财富，有力地帮助了国家发展工业，改善人民生活，建设我们伟大的祖国。我们热烈庆祝一九五一织布工作法的诞生。
    艰苦的创造过程
    一九五一织布工作法是经过一番艰苦工作创造出来的。在推广郝建秀工作法以前，织布模范们就开动脑筋，逐渐改进操作方法。有不少织布模范长时间不出次布或很少出次布，但由于我们对操作方法上的改进重视不够，未能及时总结。直到推广郝建秀工作法以后，引起了大家对操作方法的重视。织布模范们努力学习郝建秀工作法的精神，钻研技术，进一步改进自己的操作方法。十月初各地开始进行总结织布工作法，我们先后收到青岛、天津、上海、东北、西北、石家庄大兴纱厂、唐山华新纱厂、山西晋华纱厂等地的总结。青岛在八月份郝建秀工作法推广到布场时，青岛纺织管理局、纺织工会即组成织布工作法研究委员会在八个厂内进行观察、测定，把织布模范们的创造集中起来，作出总结。随即集中各厂织布模范在一个厂内学习新的织布工作法。青岛的总结起来的经验，不仅为织布模范们接受，而且已为多数织布工人所接受。天津各厂也早就总结了王德山、姜淑英、庞庆福等织布模范的操作方法，尤其是棉纺织第三厂由于何学孔技师的努力，不仅总结出了姜淑英的操作方法，而且已经开始推广，并在两个小组内取得了成绩。一九五一织布工作法中的自动布机工作法，是以青岛的总结为基础，加上庞庆福熟悉机器性能，以及天津、东北、上海等地区织布模范们个别动作上的优点组成的。普通布机工作法是以天津的姜淑英、青岛的王建德两人的操作方法相结合为基础，加上王德山、王嘉祥、曲言增等以及上海织布模范们操作上的优点组成的。织布模范、技术人员、工作人员们，运用郭瓦廖夫工作法，经过二十天日日夜夜地艰苦工作，终于把各地织布模范们操作上的优点集中起来，组织成了一九五一织布工作法。这一总结具体表现了脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合、理论与实践相结合、政治与技术相结合。一九五一织布工作法是中国织布工人操作上各种优点的集中表现，是我们国家的财富。
        一九五一织布工作法的
        主要特点
    一九五一织布工作法，是一切工作为了预防断头、减少次布、提高生产效率。分开来说，其主要特点有三：（一）工作有规律：即自动布机的巡回规律；普通布机的换梭规律与巡回规律。实行这一工作法后，织布工人的工作就由被动转为主动，就能预防断头和减少次布，降低停台率；提高生产效率，同时也提高看台能力。（二）这一工作法有一定的规律，但也有其灵活性，能够适应各厂具体情况。如看八台普通布机，其换梭分段方法，就有 “两大段”、“两段四节”、“两段八节”等三种方式。“两大段”换梭法适合于条件较差的厂；
    “两段四节”换梭法比只分“两大段”进了一步，而且适合一般工厂的情况，工人也容易接受；“两段八节”换梭法，规律性较前两种为强，但须具备较好的条件才能实行。（三）熟悉机器性能，机器一有毛病及时找保全工修理。
    按照一九五一织布工作法操作，和郝建秀工作法一样，工作不慌不忙，有条有理。因此必然是产量高、质量好，而工作轻松愉快。这样的工作法能为每个具有正确劳动态度的织布工人所接受。但是那些缺乏正确的劳动态度或坐着板凳看车的人，则首先要树立正确的劳动态度，才能正确地认识一九五一织布工作法的好处，才能把它运用到自己的工作中去。
        一九五一织布工作法
        创造的价值
    （一）必然大大减少次布。以纺织工业部规定的正布标准来检查我们的布，全国次布率平均还在百分之四以上，而一九五一织布工作法的创造者——织布模范们的次布率则长年在百分之一以下。王德山甚至两年不出次布，王建德两年仅出一匹次布。王嘉祥小组在学习郝建秀工作法以前，全组平均次布率是百分之二；学习郝建秀工作法后，九月份全组平均次布率为百分之零点五。他们按照自己的方法工作就获得如此成绩，一九五一织布工作法比他们各自的工作方法要完善得多，无疑的按照新的工作法工作，会大大减少次布。如果我们大力推广一九五一织布工作法，使次布率达到劳动模范们的水平，那末因减少次布而增加的财富是很可观的。假定全国次布率都降到百分之零点五，一年便可增加财富一千八百九十余万斤小米；降到百分之一，一年可以增加财富一千六百二十余万斤小米；即使只降到百分之二，一年也可增加财富一千零八十余万斤小米，即等于七架至十二架半战斗机。
    （二）工作有了规律，停台率降低，生产效率自然提高。直到现在，全国织布的生产效率平均还不到百分之九十，但是织布模范们的生产效率则达到了百分之九十五。假定全国织布效率提高百分之二，所创造的财富相当于四十架战斗机的价值。如果都能达到织布模范们的水平，创造的价值就更大了。
    （三）工作有规律，有计划，既节省时间又节省力气，看台能力自然提高。以测定期间到会劳动模范们提高看台能力来说，原来看十二台自动布机的，提高到二十四台至三十二台；原来只看四台普通布机的，提高到八台；原来看八台普通布机的，提高到十二台。看台能力的提高，为全部开三班提供了大批熟练工人。提高了看台能力，自然降低成本。
    （四）实行一九五一织布工作法将创造出新的更合理的定额，为改革工资、实行经济核算创造了条件。
    克服一切困难，大力推广
        一九五一织布工作法
    郝建秀工作法给国家创造了大量财富，一九五一织布工作法同样能为国家创造大量财富。我们应克服一切困难大力推广，在纺织工厂中掀起生产上的革新运动。
    推广郝建秀工作法的经验告诉我们：那个厂领导上对郝建秀工作法有正确的认识，重视推广工作，收效就大；相反的，对郝建秀工作法的重大意义没有正确的认识，对推广工作不重视，收效就小。个别工厂的领导方面以一种自满的情绪来对待推广郝建秀工作法的工作，小先生在推广工作中遇到困难得不到领导上的支持，反而受到打击。这样做推广工作要想收到良好效果是不可能的。推广一九五一织布工作法时，一定也会遇到一些困难，但是只要工厂中的党、行政、工会、青年团各方面对一九五一织布工作法有正确的认识，重视推广工作，困难是可以克服的，一九五一织布工作法一定能顺利推广。
    在推广工作中，应进行深入地教育工作，打破职工群众的保守思想，使他们认识到一九五一织布工作法能够为国家创造大量财富，增强抗美援朝的力量，支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军消灭更多的美国侵略军。执行一九五一织布工作法就是我们织布职工响应毛主席增产节约号召的实际行动。要从各方面提高职工的爱国热情，使他们积极学习与执行新的织布工作法。在推广方法上，工会应该采重点突破推动全面的办法，首先在一个小组取得成绩，用事实来说服群众，争取行政或资方的支持，以便顺利地全面推广。在推广工作开始时，因工人对新的工作法不熟练，可能使产量、质量受到一些影响，但这是暂时的，待工人熟练后，产量、质量就会很快提高，领导上不应要求立即收到重大效果。
    织布工作是纺织生产最后的制造过程，因此要使一九五一织布工作法的推广工作收到全面的效果，除织布工人努力外，还应做好保全和前部的许多工作。
    纺纱场应进一步推广郝建秀工作法，提高成纱质量，减少以至消灭葫芦纱、羽毛纱、竹节纱、强捻纱、弱捻纱、毛头毛脚纱。从落纱到装梭之间不要倒纱，以减少因倒纱造成的断纬。
    做好织布的准备工作，清纱板的隔矩二十支纱应为千分之十六，以便有效地清除纱上的杂质，减少布场的断头率；浆纱应合乎经营标准，不宜过干或过湿，含浆率不宜过高或过低，以减少因浆纱不良而造成的断头。
    切实执行固定供应制，固定机台，分清出次品的责任。
    加强织布保全工作，减少因机器运转不良造成的疵点。调整机器运转速度之间的差异，减少织布工人工作上的困难。
    此外，适当降低车间温度、湿度，亦是减少断头的重要因素。
    做好上述工作是要费力的，但是只要行政认识这些工作的重要性，进行具体的组织工作，订立联系合同，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，是能够克服一切困难作好这些工作的。
    我们一九五一年的工作是有很大成绩的。这一年中产生了两个重要的工作法。明年春天我们就要开竞赛评判会，评判各地一九五一年工作的优劣。一九五二全年的生产工作将以切实推广和执行郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法为中心。全体纺织工人应把这一工作订到爱国公约中去，展开爱国主义竞赛，争取一九五二年在纺织生产战线上取得更大的胜利。明年下半年将召开评判大会，检查这两个工作法的执行情况。希望到会的全体同志首先学会这两个工作法，在推广中起带头作用。
    同志们！毛主席号召我们：增加生产，厉行节约。我们推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法就是响应毛主席号召的实际行动。全国纺织工人应努力学习，大力推广，大大减少皮辊花、次布、回丝，提高生产效率，减低成本，使中国人民志愿军和广大人民穿到物美价廉的布匹。让我们为国家创造大量财富，发展工业生产，增强国家经济力量和国防力量，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，改善人民生活，建设我们伟大的祖国！
