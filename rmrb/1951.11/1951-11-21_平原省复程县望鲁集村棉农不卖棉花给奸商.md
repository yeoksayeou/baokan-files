    Cotton Farmers in Wangluji Village, Fucheng County, Pingyuan Province, Refuse to Sell Cotton to Profiteers
    To the Editor: After the cotton farmers in Wangluji Village, Fucheng County, Pingyuan Province, picked their new cotton, the government set standard prices for purchase, at 8,250 yuan per jin of ginned cotton. However, some profiteers in the area deliberately stirred up trouble by offering farmers 3,000 to 4,000 yuan more per jin of ginned cotton than the government's price. Some cotton farmers secretly pondered: "If we sell to them, we'll suffer losses; if we don't sell to them, we won't be patriotic." Therefore, they hesitated to sell cotton to the state. In response to this situation, the village cadres, Party members, and propagandists vigorously promoted the cotton-grain price ratio policy to the cotton farmers, explaining that the government would never let them suffer losses and that selling cotton to the state was a concrete manifestation of loving the motherland. At the same time, they explained the government's measures to stop profiteers from causing trouble. After the propaganda and education, the masses' enthusiasm for selling cotton rose again. They reflected, saying: "The government is thinking of us in every way, and selling cotton to the state will not let us suffer losses. We will sell to the state and never to the profiteers." Therefore, when a certain profiteer wanted to buy cotton from cotton farmer Li He's family at a high price, she said: "I am selling anti-American, aid-Korea cotton, patriotic cotton. No matter how much money you give me, I won't sell it to you." After receiving education, cotton farmer Wang Yan's family has already sold more than 500 jin to the cotton collection station; cotton farmers on North Street sold more than 14,000 jin in three days. According to statistics, the whole village has sold 143,430 jin of new cotton and recovered more than 29,000 jin of pre-purchased cotton.

    平原省复程县望鲁集村棉农不卖棉花给奸商
    编辑同志：平原省复程县望鲁集村棉农，在摘下新棉后，政府就规定了标准价格，进行收购，每斤皮棉价八千二百五十元。但该地部分奸商故意从中捣乱，他们以每斤皮棉高出政府规定价三、四千元向棉农收购。部分棉农心里就暗自盘算：“卖吧，吃亏，不卖吧，又是不爱国”，因此，对向国家售棉表示犹豫。该村干部、党员和宣传员针对这一情况，就大力向棉农宣传棉粮比价政策，说明政府决不会叫棉农吃亏，卖棉给国家，是热爱祖国的具体表现。同时，并向他们说明政府制止奸商捣乱的办法。经过宣传教育，群众卖棉情绪又高涨起来，他们反映说：“政府处处都替咱们打算，卖棉给国家也不会叫咱吃亏，咱们还是卖给国家，决不卖给奸商。”因此，当某奸商要以高价买棉农李何氏的棉花时，她说：“我是卖的抗美棉，爱国花，你给的钱再多，我也不卖。”棉农王阎氏在经过教育后，已卖给收棉站五百多斤；北大街棉农三天就卖了一万四千多斤。据统计：目前全村已卖出新棉十四万三千四百三十斤，收回预购棉二万九千多斤。
