　　Our Great Motherland
　　The seismograph is an ancient Chinese instrument for recording earthquakes. It was invented by Zhang Heng, a great Chinese scientist, 1,819 years ago. The transverse wave motion generated during an earthquake causes a dragon's mouth in a certain direction to eject a ball, which falls into a frog's mouth, thereby allowing the direction of the epicenter to be determined. This model was made by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government based on the records in the Biography of Zhang Heng in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty.

　　我们伟大的祖国
    地动仪是我国古代纪录地震的仪器。它是距今一千八百十九年前我国伟大科学家张衡所发明的。地震时发生的横波运动，使某方龙口吐丸，落入蛙口，由此可测定震源的方向。这个模型是中央人民政府文化部文物局照后汉书张衡传的记载仿制的。
