Volunteer Army Representative Chai Chuanruo Returns to the Front Lines to Convey Enthusiasm, Inspiring the Fighting Will of the Volunteer Army

Editor: On the afternoon of the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, we were very honored to hear many exciting good news brought from the motherland by Volunteer Army representative Comrade Chai Chuanruo.

The report was held in a beautiful cinema, which was a very rare event. As everyone sat in comfortable seats, they naturally missed the people of the motherland who were engaged in glorious construction.

From Comrade Chai Chuanruo's speech, we learned how much the people of the motherland love the Volunteer Army; how the workers are producing with the attitude of masters, increasing wealth for the country, and smashing the shameful blockade of American imperialism; how the farmers are carrying out patriotic production increase campaigns; and how young students are enthusiastically participating in national defense construction. Every comrade was moved by the love of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army and excited by the brilliant achievements of the great motherland in the past year. Many people's faces shone with pride and their eyes sparkled with tears of emotion, which made us feel even more the lovableness of the great motherland.

Comrade Chai Chuanruo's report greatly inspired our fighting will. We will fight more bravely to defend the great motherland.

Chinese People's Volunteer Army Soldier Zhuoyue

    志愿军代表柴川若回前线传达鼓舞了志愿军的战斗意志
    编辑同志：志愿军出国作战一周年的第二天下午，我们十分荣幸地听到了志愿军归国代表柴川若同志从祖国带来的令人兴奋的许多好消息。
    报告是在一座漂亮的电影院里举行的，这是非常难得的事。当大家坐在舒适的座位上时，都自然地格外遥念起在进行着辉煌建设的祖国人民。
    从柴川若同志的讲话中，我们了解到：祖国人民如何热爱着志愿军；工人们是怎样以主人翁的姿态在生产着，为国家增产着财富，粉碎了美帝国主义可耻的封锁；农民们是如何在开展着爱国丰产竞赛运动；青年学生们如何踊跃地参加国防建设。每个同志都为祖国人民对志愿军的热爱而感动，为伟大祖国一年来的辉煌成就而兴奋。许多人兴奋得脸上放出骄傲的光彩，眼里闪铄着感动的眼泪，使我们更加觉得伟大祖国的可爱。
    柴川若同志的报告大大地鼓舞了我们的战斗意志，我们一定更英勇地战斗，保卫伟大的祖国。
                  中国人民志愿军战士　卓越
