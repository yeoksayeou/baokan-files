    CCP Iron Li County Committee Organ Party Members Examine "Li Sixi Thought"
    Editor: The thirteen party members of our organ (CCP Heilongjiang Province Iron Li County Committee) branch have examined "Li Sixi Thought" and "Wang Fu Thought" ("Wang Fu Thought" also refers to the backward thinking of not seeing the revolutionary future and wanting to go home to engage in production when encountering difficulties in work – Editor). You Sizhen, a cadre from the County Armed Forces Department, said: "Whenever I encounter difficulties in my work, I lack the courage to overcome them, and I always feel that it is better to go home and drive a rubber-tired cart (large cart)." Yin Zonglin, an organization member from the County Committee Organization Department, felt it difficult to organize materials due to his low cultural and theoretical level, and he developed the idea of "going home to engage in production to save trouble." Liu Fu'an, an accountant from the County Committee Secretariat, also examined his own thinking. After analyzing and criticizing this backward thinking, everyone realized that: if we do not study hard usually, the conservative thinking of peasants will not be transformed, and therefore we will not see the revolutionary future and will develop retirement thoughts. Everyone expressed that they will study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hard, and will conduct regular ideological examinations to gradually improve their ideological level.

### 中共铁骊县委机关党员检查“李四喜思想”

    中共铁骊县委机关党员检查“李四喜思想”
    编辑同志：我们机关（中共黑龙江省铁骊县委员会）支部的十三个党员，检查了“李四喜思想”和“王福思想”（“王福思想”也是看不到革命前途，工作中遇到困难就想回家生产的落后思想——编者）。县武装部干事由思珍说：“我在工作中一遇到困难，就缺乏勇气去克服，总觉得不如回家去赶胶皮车（大车）。”县委组织部组织员尹宗林因为文化、理论水平低，整理材料感到困难，产生了“回家生产省事”的思想。县委秘书处会计刘福安也检查了自己的思想。经过对这种落后的思想分析、批判，大家认识到：平常不好好学习，农民保守思想得不到改造，因此看不到革命的前途，就会产生退休思想。大家表示要好好学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，并要经常进行思想检查，把自己思想水平逐步提高。
