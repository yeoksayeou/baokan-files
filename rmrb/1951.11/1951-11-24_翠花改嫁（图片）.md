    Cuihua Remarries
    Fang Zengxian
    (7) Cuihua waited a long time but received no reply. This day, Comrade Wu from the district came to the village to convey work instructions, so she plucked up her courage and went to inquire about the news herself.
    (8) Old Man Wang was a village cadre, and he was also present that day. When he saw Cuihua coming, he hurried out and said to her, "Comrade Wu is arranging work; what urgent matter do you have?" Comrade Wu also casually said, "What is it? Let's talk about it tomorrow!" Cuihua was so ashamed that her face turned red, and she left without saying a word.
    (9) This matter was soon known by her mother-in-law. So, her mother-in-law questioned her about what was going on. Cuihua mustered her courage and told her the story. Her mother-in-law not only didn't sympathize but also scolded her for "undermining family reputation" and said that she was not allowed to leave the house in the future.

    （七）翠花等了好久，也没得到回音。这天区里吴同志来村里传达工作，她便硬着头皮自己跑去探听消息。
    （八）王老头是村里的干部，这天他也在场，他见翠花来了，便赶出来对她说：“吴同志在布置工作，你有什麽要紧事？”吴同志也随口说：“什麽事？明天再谈吧！”翠花羞得满面通红，一句话也没说出来，就走了。
    （九）这事不久便被她婆婆知道了。于是婆婆追问她是怎会儿事？翠花就鼓着勇气把这事情讲了。她婆婆不但不同情，反而骂她“破坏门风”，并说以后不准她出街门。
