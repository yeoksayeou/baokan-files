Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th: Our front-line reporter reports: The cold early winter of Korea has arrived. However, the soldiers of the US 1st Cavalry Division, captured in the Yujishan area on October 24th, are still wearing thin and dirty summer uniforms. Meanwhile, the Chinese and Korean People's fighters are wearing brand new padded clothes, leather boots, and绒 hats. According to prisoner Kario Genovese, before Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," each company of the 1st Cavalry Division had more than two hundred men. But after only a month of war, each company had only half the men left. He said: "The terrible winter is coming again, this war should end immediately; otherwise, all of us will die." When our soldiers told them the news of the resumption of armistice negotiations, they said: "Our generals must not play any more tricks, hurry up and stop the war and let us go back and have a happy Christmas!"

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Several reports published by the British bourgeois press continue to reveal that the morale of the British accomplice troops invading Korea is very low, and they urgently hope that the war will end quickly.

The British "Times" published a letter from Collins, chairman of the Christian Action Society, on October 27, mentioning the mental and physical anxiety of the British soldiers invading Korea. Collins excerpted a letter from a young Briton fighting for Wall Street in Korea. The soldier appealed to British "charitable organizations" to urgently send winter clothing to British soldiers in Korea. The soldier said sadly: "I pray to God that this war will end immediately, because after another Arctic winter of severe cold and facing experienced enemies, some people will not be able to survive."

The Manchester Guardian published a message on October 29th under the headline "An Army Without Heroism," reporting the return of more than 700 British soldiers from Korea to the British port of Liverpool. The newspaper reporter commented: "They don't look particularly like returning heroes, and the photographers had to persuade them to put on appropriate expressions of joy."

    被俘的美军骑一师士兵初冬仍穿着肮脏的夏衣
    英报透露侵朝英军士气低沉
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜的寒冷的初冬已经来到了。但在十月二十四日鱼积山里地区被俘的美国骑兵第一师的士兵仍穿着单薄而肮脏的夏衣。而中朝人民战士已穿着崭新的棉衣、皮靴和戴着绒帽。据俘虏卡里奥·格诺维兹供称：在范佛里特的“秋季攻势”之前，骑一师每个连队各有两百多人。可是经过了短短一个月的战争，各个连队只剩下了一半人。他说：“可怕的冬天又要来了，这个战争应该立即结束；否则，我们的人都要死光了。”当我军战士把恢复停战谈判的消息告诉他们时，他们说：“我们的将军们可千万别再玩什么把戏了，赶快把战争停下来，让我们回去过一个快乐的圣诞节吧！”
    【新华社九日讯】英国资产阶级报纸发表的若干消息，继续透露出侵略朝鲜的英国帮凶军队的士气很低沉，他们迫切地希望战争迅速停止。
    英国“泰晤士报”在十月二十七日发表的基督教行动会主席科林斯的一封信里，提到侵朝英军士兵精神上和身体上不安的情况。科林斯摘录了在朝鲜为华尔街作战的一个英国青年的来信。该士兵向英国的“慈善机关”呼吁，要求火速以冬季服装送给在朝鲜的英国士兵。该士兵悲哀地说：“我祷告上帝使这次战争立刻结束，因为，再经过一个北极冬季的酷寒并面对着经验丰富的敌人，有些人是不能够生还的了。”
    曼彻斯特卫报十月二十九日以“没有英雄气概的军队”为标题，登载了七百多名英国士兵从朝鲜回到英国港口利物浦的消息。该报记者评论说：“看起来他们并不特别像还乡的英雄，摄影记者不得不劝他们装出合适的欢乐的神情。”
