Gu Yushang, a staff member of the Supreme People's Court, posed as the head of the Supreme People's Court's trial group, swindled, and extorted large sums of money, seriously damaging the prestige of the People's Government. After investigation and trial by the Beijing People's Court, Gu Yushang was sentenced to death on November 7. Zhang Weiying, Tu Zhanhua, and others who committed crimes with him were all sentenced to prison.

Gu Yushang had been a "judge" in the Kuomintang reactionary court for many years, consistently engaging in corruption and bribery. In 1949, he concealed his past misdeeds and entered the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government. In the spring of 1950, Gu Yushang, posing as the head of the Supreme People's Court trial group, became acquainted with Dong Guangxun, a shareholder of the privately-owned Xinhua Xing Badge Industrial Cooperative. At that time, Gao Zhiguang and Tu Zhanhua, friends of Dong Guangxun, appealed to the Supreme People's Court regarding a debt case. Through Dong Guangxun and Guo Shouqing, the owner of the privately-owned North China Secondhand Goods Store, Gu Yushang extorted a bribe of 5 million yuan from Gao Zhiguang and others, claiming that he could help Gao Zhiguang change the original verdict. In this bribery case, Gu Yushang received a bribe of 2 million yuan, Dong Guangxun deducted 750,000 yuan, and 500,000 yuan was distributed to Guo Shouqing. In October 1950, Gu Yushang used the same method, through Tu Zhanhua, to extort 10 million yuan in bribes from Liu Fengxiang and Mao Jinfu, shareholders of the privately-owned Wentongxiang Iron Factory, and fabricated a "main text of the judgment" that met the wishes of Liu Fengxiang and others, swindling 5 million yuan in bribes, of which Tu Zhanhua received 600,000 yuan. In November 1950, Gu Yushang and his wife, Zhang Weiying, defrauded Chen Zhiheng, the manager of the Xinxin Canteen, of 3.2 million yuan in bribes.

Gu Yushang's criminal acts of perverting the law for bribes and seriously damaging the prestige of the People's Government aroused the anger of the masses. On the day the verdict against Gu Yushang was announced, more than 450 staff representatives from 60 agencies under the Beijing Municipal People's Government, various district people's governments, public enterprise departments, and political and legal departments and financial and economic departments under the Central People's Government attended the court hearing. After the judges announced Gu Yushang's crimes, eight representatives spoke in court, unanimously denouncing Gu Yushang's unforgivable crimes and demanding that the People's Court severely punish him. Zuo Cai, a representative of the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, spoke, requesting the Municipal People's Court to sentence Gu Yushang to death in accordance with the spirit of Article 18 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The Beijing People's Court, based on Gu Yushang's serious crimes and accepting everyone's opinions, announced in court that Gu Yushang was sentenced to death, and Gu Yushang's accomplice Zhang Weiying was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 100 million yuan. At this time, warm applause resounded throughout the courtroom.

Other criminals involved in the case were also punished. Tu Zhanhua was sentenced to one and a half years in prison, Dong Guangxun was sentenced to one year in prison, and Guo Shouqing was sentenced to six months in prison. The several businessmen who offered bribes, Liu Fengxiang, Mao Jinfu, Gao Zhiguang, and Chen Zhiheng, were also punished accordingly. (Zeng Pu)

　　Editor's note: On April 19, this newspaper received a letter from Liu Bingsheng (Liu Fengxiang's son), a student at Fu Jen Catholic University, exposing Gu and others' embezzlement in the trial of the Wentongxiang Iron Factory debt case, "demanding that these corrupt elements who have infiltrated the country's highest judicial organs be eliminated." This newspaper forwarded the letter to the Supreme People's Court for handling. The Beijing People's Court accepted the instructions of the Supreme People's Court and arrested Gu and others. After detailed interrogation, the criminal was sentenced to death. The spirit of reader Liu Bingsheng, who is responsible to the people and exposes corruption, is worthy of commendation.

　　最高人民法院职员顾裕尚贪污纳贿
    已被北京市人民法院判处死刑
    本报读者揭发顾犯贪污行为的精神值得表扬
    最高人民法院职员顾裕尚，冒充最高人民法院审判组长，招摇撞骗，敲诈、勒索大量钱财，严重地损害了人民政府的威信。北京市人民法院经过调查审理，已在十一月七日判处顾裕尚死刑。同他一起犯罪的张伟莹、屠占华等人。都判了徒刑。
    顾裕尚过去在国民党反动法院当“推事”多年，一向贪赃纳贿。一九四九年，他隐瞒过去的劣迹，混进中央人民政府最高人民法院工作。一九五○年春，顾裕尚冒充最高人民法院审判组组长，结识了私营新华兴证章工业社股东董光勋。当时董光勋的朋友高志广、屠占华等人因为债务案件，上诉于最高人民法院，顾裕尚经过董光勋和私营华北旧货铺铺主郭寿卿，向高志广等索取贿金五百万元，扬言他可以帮助高志广改变原判。在此次贿赂案中，顾裕尚得到贿金二百万元，董光勋扣取七十五万元，分给郭寿卿五十万元。一九五○年十月，顾裕尚用同样手段，经过屠占华向私营文同祥铁工厂股东刘凤翔、毛锦福索取贿款一千万元，并捏造符合刘凤翔等人愿望的“判决主文”，骗到贿款五百万元，其中屠占华分得六十万元。一九五○年十一月，顾裕尚和他的妻子张伟莹向新新食堂经理陈之珩骗取贿款三百二十万元。
    顾裕尚贪赃枉法，严重损害人民政府威信的罪恶行为，引起群众的愤怒。在宣布判决顾裕尚的那天，北京市人民政府所属各局、处及各区人民政府、公营企业部门，中央人民政府所属政法部门、财经部门等六十个机关工作人员代表四百五十多人，都到法庭旁听。审判员宣布了顾裕尚的罪行后，有八个代表当庭发言，一致痛斥顾裕尚的不可饶恕的罪行，都要求人民法院加以严惩。北京市人民检察署代表左才发言，要求市人民法院根据人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十八条的精神，判处顾裕尚死刑。
    北京市人民法院根据顾裕尚的严重罪行，接受大家的意见，当庭宣布判处顾裕尚死刑，顾裕尚的同谋犯张伟莹判处五年徒刑，并判处罚金一亿元。这时，整个法庭响起了热烈的掌声。
    同案的其他罪犯，也都受到惩罚。屠占华判徒刑一年半，董光勋判徒刑一年，郭寿卿判徒刑六个月。行贿的那几个商人：刘凤翔、毛锦福、高志广、陈之珩等也分别受了处分。（曾普）
    编者按：四月十九日，本报收到辅仁大学学生刘炳生（刘凤翔的儿子）的来信，揭发顾犯等在审理文同祥铁工厂债务案件中的贪污行为，“要求把这些混进国家最高司法机关的贪污分子清除出去”。本报当将此信转致最高人民法院处理。北京市人民法院接受最高人民法院指示，当将顾犯等逮捕。经详细审讯，将该犯判处死刑。读者刘炳生这种对人民负责，揭发贪污的精神，是值得表扬的。
