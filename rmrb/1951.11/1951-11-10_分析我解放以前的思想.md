    Analyzing My Thoughts Before Liberation
    Jin Yuelin, Head of the Philosophy Department, Tsinghua University

    I went to the United States to study when I was nineteen. By the time of the May Fourth Movement, I had already been in graduate school for two years. At this time, the self-important attitude of intellectuals had already been cultivated. Based on personal interest, I had fallen into the quagmire of decadent bourgeois philosophy. After returning to China, I introduced this kind of metaphysical, conceptual-patterned philosophy, and even tried to create this kind of personal philosophical system. Such a system was originally detached from reality: teaching was for the sake of teaching, and research was for the sake of research. The purpose of conducting research, teaching, and working hard according to social needs was simply out of the question. On the one hand, I misled students in my professional work, and on the other hand, I also fostered the academic atmosphere at Tsinghua University that emphasized personal interests.
    I had a very strong pure technical viewpoint. I particularly emphasized abstract analytical methods and also focused on training analytical techniques. I used to be a realist. Personally, I did insist on the materialist elements in realism, and I did fight against idealists for nearly thirty years. However, my focus was not on the differences in viewpoints between materialism and idealism, nor on the errors in the starting point of idealism, but only on the inconsistency of idealism. I believed that a person had the freedom to believe in idealism, but I wanted to point out that their thinking was inconsistent. I did not care about other people's ideological direction, only about their thinking techniques. In this respect, I also fostered the academic atmosphere of pure technical viewpoints at Tsinghua University.
    Because I fundamentally did not want to ask about politics, I had a set of muddled ideas that seemed really inexplicable on the surface. I approved of communism, but I opposed the Communist Party. In Kunming, when it was mentioned that the Communist Party might liberate Beijing, I expressed that I was willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party, but before the liberation of Beijing, I expressed wavering again.
    Around 1942 to 1943, I began to "oppose" Chiang Kai-shek. My opposition was only verbal. Not only did I not oppose him in action, but I did not even oppose him in writing. I could not escape a kind of casual compromise. When the reactionary government was particularly outrageous, I sometimes had the impulse to draw my sword, but this impulse could not last for five minutes. After five minutes, I returned to my free and undisciplined life. In this respect, I also fostered the atmosphere among Tsinghua University teachers of not asking about politics.
    I wanted to resist Japan, but I did not understand imperialism. What I wanted to resist was Japan. What I opposed was Japan coming to occupy Chinese land and kill Chinese people; what I opposed even more was the Japanese coming to rule China. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, I, like many intellectuals, felt relieved. However, I had no confidence in the future of the War of Resistance, so I always wanted foreign countries to help, especially Britain and the United States. I believed that "the power of democracy" could defeat the power of autocratic monarchy.
    Because I did not understand imperialism, I also had a set of muddled ideas about the relationship between international affairs and the nation. I admired the political and military power of Britain and the United States, but I opposed their political and military aggression. I fundamentally looked down on American culture, but I was actually already a tool of American cultural aggression. I thought that I, like many teachers at Tsinghua University, was patriotic, but was my way of loving the country acceptable?
    The above is a general description of my specific ideological situation as a teacher before liberation. Such thoughts seem to be just chaotic, and on the surface, they seem to have no consistency and seem to have no position at all. Now, looking back, these thoughts are quite consistent and have a position.
    I am a middle-of-the-road intellectual of the petty bourgeoisie. In terms of economic status, I belong to the petty bourgeoisie, but at the same time, I also belong to the intellectual stratum. This stratum is very special in China. It does not have the power of the ruling class, but it enjoys some of the benefits of the ruling class. Its predecessor can be a scholar or a high-ranking official. The main ideology of intellectuals like me is a special kind of conservatism, a kind of "riding a donkey" ideology. I personally did not particularly want to be the person riding the horse in front of me, but I even more did not want to be the person pushing the cart behind me. My main idea was to maintain the original rule.
    However, I did hate fascism, so I would waver between reaction and progress. I would not be thoroughly reactionary, nor would I be easily thoroughly progressive. My previous philosophy was a philosophy that was divorced from theory and practice. I opposed Chiang Kai-shek and approved of communism. But this "opposition" and "approval" were only verbal opposition and approval. I fundamentally did not want to have political action. The rest of my muddled ideas also have their consistency.
    During the War of Resistance against Japan, I did have a national standpoint, but the content of this standpoint was only the consciousness of a middle-of-the-road intellectual of the petty bourgeoisie. I did oppose the Japanese coming to kill our Chinese people and invade our land, but what I was most concerned about was perhaps still the social status, teaching profession, and maintenance of personal freedom and interests that I was afraid of losing. In any case, I did not think from the perspective of the interests of the people, and there was no such thing as a people's standpoint at all. Otherwise, I would not have lacked confidence in the War of Resistance.
    In teaching, I only helped Tsinghua University emphasize personal interests, strengthened Tsinghua University's pure technical viewpoint, and fostered Tsinghua University's academic atmosphere of not asking about politics. However, my teaching at Tsinghua University was already after the May Fourth Movement. In the years after the May Fourth Movement, progressive ideas had already taken root, and the struggle between progressive forces and reactionary forces had become fierce. In such an era, the academic atmosphere that I helped to foster could not but have the effect of hindering progress. During this period, what played a progressive role was the student movement, but I did not provide any active help to the student movement.
    Looking back, my muddled thoughts all the way until liberation were consistent muddled thoughts, which were compromising thoughts that swayed from side to side and were produced by the desire to maintain the original social order. A person with such thoughts was of course a person who played a role in hindering progress.
    It will soon be three years since the liberation of Tsinghua University, one month and a few days later. My thoughts have indeed changed somewhat, but there are still many undesirable thoughts, but they have not been exposed in this current stage of learning. I myself have already discovered some, but this is obviously not enough. In the future, my comrades in the group will have to continue to help me excavate and help me transform in the process of learning. I am a person who tends to change slowly, but time is pressing, and it cannot always be slow.

### 分析我解放以前的思想

    分析我解放以前的思想
    清华大学哲学系主任  金岳霖
    我在十九岁的时候到美国去读书，在五四运动的时候，已经在大学研究院读了两年书。这时，知识分子自高自大的心已经养成了。凭个人的兴趣，我已陷入资产阶级腐朽哲学底泥坑。回国后，我又介绍这一类的形而上的、概念图案式的哲学，并且还努力创造了这一类的个人哲学体系。这样的体系本来是离开现实的：教书是为教书而教书，研究是为研究而研究。按照社会底需要而研究，而教书，而努力的宗旨根本谈不上。一方面在业务上我误人子弟，另一方面我也助长了清华大学那种强调个人兴趣的学风。
    我有非常浓厚的纯技术观点，我特别着重抽象的分析方法，也着重训练分析技术。我从前是一个实在论者，就我个人说，我的确坚持实在论中的唯物成分，我的确和唯心论者作了近三十年的斗争。但是，我的注意点并不在唯物与唯心在观点上的分别，并不在唯心论出发点的错误，而只是在唯心论底说不通。我认为一个人有相信唯心论的自由，但是我要指出他的思想说不通，我不管别人底思想方向，只管别人的思想技术，在这一点上我又助长了清华大学的纯技术观点的学风。
    因为我根本不愿意问政治，我有一套表面上看来实在是莫名其妙的糊涂思想。我赞成共产主义，可是又反对共产党。在昆明谈到共产党有解放北京底可能时，我表示我愿意接受共产党的领导，可是在北京解放前我又表示动摇。
    大约是在一九四二年到一九四三年之间，我开始“反对”蒋介石。我那反对只是口头上的反对，不但行动上我没有反对，连文字上的反对都没有。我逃不出一种随随便便的妥协性。在反动政府特别不像样的时候，我有时也有拔剑而起的情绪，但是这情绪维持不了五分钟，五分钟之后，我又回到我那自由散漫的生活中去了。在这一点上，我又助长了清华大学教师不问政治底风气。
    我是要抗日的，但是我不认识帝国主义。我所要抗的是日本，我所反对的是日本来占中国的土地、杀中国的人；更反对的是日本人来统治中国。抗日军兴，我和许多知识分子一样觉得松了一口气。但是对于抗日底前途没有信心，所以我总想外国来帮助，尤其是英美。我相信“民主的力量”可以打败君主专制的力量。
    因为不懂得帝国主义，我在国际与民族底关系上也有一套糊涂思想。我崇拜英美底政治军事力量，可是我反对他们的政治、军事的侵略，我根本看不起美国的文化，可是我实在早已成为美国文化侵略底工具。我想，我和清华大学许多教师一样是爱国的，但是照我这样的爱法行不行呢？
    以上大致说来是我个人在解放前教师生活中的具体的思想情况。这样的思想似乎只是混乱而已，表面上看来似乎毫无一致的地方，似乎根本就没有立场。现在回想一下，这种思想是相当一致的，是有立场的。
    我是一个小资产阶级的中派知识分子。就经济地位说，我是属于小资产阶级的，可是同时我又属于知识分子这一阶层。这一阶层在中国很特别。它没有统治阶级的权力，可是它享受一部分统治阶级的利益，它的前身可以是士，也可以是大夫。像我这样的知识分子底主要思想是一种特别的保守主义，一种“骑驴”主义。我个人固然不十分想做在我前面骑马的人，但是更不要做在我后面推车的人。我的主要思想是要维持原来的统治。
    可是，我的确讨厌法西斯主义，所以我会摇摆于反动与进步之间。我不会彻底反动，也不容易彻底进步。我从前的哲学是理论与实际脱了节的哲学，我反对蒋介石，赞成共产主义。但这个“反对”与“赞成”都只是口头上的反对与赞成，我根本不愿意有政治上的行动。其余的糊涂思想也是有它的一致性的。
    在抗日战争时期，我的确是有民族立场的，但是这个立场的内容只是小资产阶级中派知识分子的意识。我的确反对日本人来杀我们中国人、侵占我们的土地，但是我最关心的也许依然是我所怕要失去的社会上的地位、教书的职业、个人自由兴趣底维持。无论如何，我没有从人民的利益着想，根本谈不上人民立场。不然的话，我不至于对抗日没有信心。
    在教学上，我只是帮助了清华大学强调个人兴趣，加强了清华大学的纯技术观点，助长了清华大学不问政治的学风。可是我在清华大学教书已经是在“五四”运动之后，在“五四”之后的几年中，进步的思想已经生了根，进步力量和反动力量底斗争已经激烈起来。在这样的时代，我所帮助了的学风不能没有阻碍进步的作用。在这时期中，起进步作用的是学生运动，可是对于学生运动我的确毫无积极的帮助。
    回想起来，我那一直到解放时的糊涂思想是一致的糊涂思想，是要维持原来社会秩序而产生的东摇西摆的妥协思想。有这样思想的人当然是一个起了阻碍进步作用的人。
    清华大学的解放，一个月零几天之后，就要三年了，我的思想确有一些改变，但要不得的思想依然很多，不过在现在这一学习阶段上没有暴露而已。我自己已经发现了一些，但是这显然是不够的，以后还是要小组同仁在学习中继续帮助我发掘，帮助我改造。我是一个倾向于慢慢改的人，但是时机迫切，不能老是慢慢的了。
