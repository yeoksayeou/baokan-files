Seeing the Collective Marriage of Widows in Cangxi Village, the Masses Understand the Benefits of the Marriage Law

In the past, women in Cangxi Village, Sixth District, Xiuning County, southern Anhui, were severely constrained by the feudal marriage system. It was difficult for widows to remarry. Even if they did remarry, they were not allowed to take their children, land, or leave through the main gate (they could only leave through the back door or a small hole). They were not even allowed to stay at home for three days before the wedding, but could only camp out in the small sheds on the mountain slopes where they watched over the vegetables. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, due to insufficient publicity and education work in the village, the people's feudal remnants had not been eradicated, and widows had not been completely liberated on the issue of marriage.

In October of this year, the circuit court of the Southern Anhui People's Court came to the village, held several meetings, and repeatedly explained the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, pointing out that widows had freedom of marriage and no one should interfere. Later, the circuit court held a sentencing rally on marriage cases, once again exposing the crimes of the feudal marriage system and explaining the benefits of new marriage and new families. The masses' understanding was greatly improved. Five widows in the village who had found partners, Cheng Qiaoxian, Lu Guihua, Wang Guixiang, etc., went to the district government one after another to register their marriages, and held a collective wedding ceremony on October 29. Influenced by them, Widow Wang from nearby Zhengwan Village and Widow Wang Dongxiang from Taoxi Village also rushed to join their sweethearts and hold the wedding together. On the afternoon of October 29, the Farmers' Association was packed with people, and amid applause and laughter, seven couples entered the hall. Wang You Shun, the director of the Farmers' Association, acted as the wedding witness. He said, "Today, the Marriage Law has won a great victory in our village. In the future, we must better implement the Marriage Law and completely overthrow the feudal marriage system." Shao Taohua, the director of the Women's Federation, said, "With the implementation of the Marriage Law, widows are becoming brides. Now our women have been liberated. We should carry more firewood, sell it for money, and donate it to airplanes and cannons to defeat the American robbers, so that we can be worthy of the People's Government." After the meeting, the masses all reflected, "After seeing this collective wedding, we truly understand the benefits of the Marriage Law."

    看到藏溪村寡妇集体结婚  群众明白了婚姻法的好处
    皖南休宁县第六区藏溪村妇女，过去受封建婚姻制度的束缚很厉害。寡妇要想改嫁是难事。就是有改嫁的，也不准带小孩，不准带田地，不准从大门出去（只能从后门或小洞出去），出嫁前三天还不准在家里住，只能到山地里守菜的小草棚里去露宿。婚姻法颁布后，由于该村宣传教育工作做得不够，群众的封建残余思想还未能根除，寡妇在婚姻问题上还没有得到彻底的解放。
    今年十月，皖南人民法院的巡回审判小组到了这村，开了几次会，反复讲解婚姻法的基本精神，指明寡妇婚姻自由，任何人不得干涉。后来巡回审判小组又召开了婚姻案件宣判大会，再一次揭发封建婚姻制度的罪恶，说明新婚姻、新家庭的好处，群众的认识大大提高了一步。全村已找到对象的五个寡妇程巧仙、卢桂花、汪桂香等，先后到区政府办理结婚登记手续，并在十月二十九日举行集体结婚典礼。附近郑湾村的寡妇汪氏和桃溪村的寡妇汪冬香，受了她们的影响，也都和自己的爱人赶来一齐举行婚礼。十月二十九日下午，农会里挤满了人，在拍手欢笑声中，七对新人走进礼堂。农会主任汪有顺做证婚人，他说：“今天婚姻法在我们村子里打了一个大胜仗，以后我们还要更好地贯彻婚姻法，彻底打垮封建婚姻制度。”妇女会主任邵桃花说：“实行婚姻法，寡妇做新娘，现在我们妇女翻身了。我们应该多挑一担柴，卖了钱捐献飞机大炮，打败美国强盗，这样才对得起人民政府。”会后群众都反映：“看了这次集体结婚，可真正明白了婚姻法的好处了。”
