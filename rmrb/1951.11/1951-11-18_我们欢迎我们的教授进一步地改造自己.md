    We Welcome Our Professor to Further Remold Himself
    We have a professor at the Engineering College of Peking University who, a few weeks ago while teaching "Transformer Design and Manufacturing," did not touch upon the actual situation of our motherland when discussing "Organization of Electric Motor Factories." He uncritically presented a set of American imperialist systems. He said: The top level of the factory is the board of directors, below the board of directors are the managers and factory directors, below the factory directors are the "supervisors," then the "foremen," and below the "foremen" are the workers. He also emphasized the importance of the "foremen." After lecturing for an hour, some students laughed and offered opinions to him. But he said, "I think it's beneficial for you to know these things, and you'll be able to use them in the future." "China doesn't have any standards yet." "I don't know anything about Soviet stuff."
    Our young students will all become cadres for the construction of our great motherland after graduation. Why doesn't our school teach the factory management system of New China in connection with China's actual situation, but insist on uncritically transplanting a set of American imperialist management systems? Our working class is the leading class of the country, and no one can ignore that our factory management must rely on the working class. But this professor is still teaching us to learn the barbaric American bourgeois management system of oppressing workers layer by layer, and emphasizing the importance of the "foremen" who ride on the workers' heads. Isn't this diametrically opposed to the actual situation of our New China?
    Materials on our factory organization and factory management, and materials introducing advanced Soviet experiences, are not impossible to find in books, newspapers, and magazines. Why are our teachers turning a blind eye to this and reluctant to abandon the outdated American management system? This professor also often intersperses his lectures with a lot of English. When giving examples, he mentions "AIEE" (American Institute of Electrical Engineers) this and that. It sounds very harsh to the students, and they have given him many opinions. After the suggestions, he has begun to use Chinese for lectures. The students warmly welcome this improvement and eagerly hope that he will make greater progress in all aspects during this political study movement of teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities.

    我们欢迎我们的教授进一步地改造自己
    我们北京大学工学院有一位教授，在数周前教“变压器设计及制造”时，讲到“电机制造厂的组织”，一点也没有涉及祖国的实际情况，一点也不加分析不加批判地搬弄了美国帝国主义的一套制度。他说：工厂的最上层是董事会，董事会下面有经理、厂长，厂长下面有“监督”，再下面有“工长”，“工长”下面是工人。他还强调“工长”的重要性。讲了一个钟头，同学们有的听得发笑，向他提意见。但是他却说：“我想这些东西你们知道是有好处的，将来出去是用得着的。”“中国现在还没有什么规范。”“苏联的东西我不知道。”
    我们青年学生毕业后都是建设我们伟大祖国的干部。我们的学校为什么不联系中国的实际情况讲新中国的工厂管理制度，而偏要不加批判地硬搬美国帝国主义的一套管理制度呢？我们的工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，谁也不能忽视我们的工厂管理必须依靠工人阶级。而这位教授还在教我们学习美国资产阶级野蛮地一层一层压迫工人的管理制度，并且强调骑在工人头上的“工长”的重要，这和我们新中国的实际情况不是背道而驰的吗？
    我们的工厂组织、工厂管理的材料，和介绍苏联先进经验的材料，在书籍、报纸、杂志中并不是找不到，我们的教师为什么对此熟视无睹，而恋恋不舍美国那一套落后的管理制度呢？这位教授讲课时，还时常夹杂许多英文。举例时动不动就是“AIEE”（美国电机工程师学会）如何如何。同学们听起来很刺耳，给他提了许多意见。经过提意见后，他已开始改用中文讲课了。同学们热烈欢迎他这种改进，并迫切地希望他在这次京、津大学教师的政治学习运动中，在各方面有更大的进步。
