Xinhua News Agency, November 21st—Tokyo Dispatch: The U.S. aggressors are intensifying the training of Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, preparing to send them to the Korean battlefield to serve as Marines. According to reliable sources, there are currently four divisions of Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Okinawa and Jeju Island off the southern coast of Korea, being trained by officers from Ridgway's headquarters. It is claimed that 25,000 former Japanese soldiers and 50,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers have been transported in batches to Okinawa and Jeju Island. Two thousand former Japanese officers had already moved into barracks on Okinawa in August. The infantry battalions of the various divisions being trained there are mostly composed of Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops; the artillery and staff agencies are entirely composed of U.S. troops.

To train reserve troops for the forces invading Korea, the U.S. military has also formed two training regiments on Okinawa to train Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops; the training regiments are commanded by U.S. military officer Buckler. Chase, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Taiwan, sent a group of bandit army cadres led by Sun Li-jen to Okinawa in September to participate in training. It is also reported that Chase visited the island at the end of October to inspect the aforementioned Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in training, and that these bandit troops are preparing to go to Korea soon.

Furthermore, in order to intensify the training of Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Okinawa and Taiwan, Ridgway has appointed Hasegawa (former admiral), a war criminal who once served as the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, as a military advisor to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. Hasegawa will leave Tokyo for Taiwan with Colonel Tomita, a former Japanese naval officer.

    美加紧训练日蒋匪军
    准备用以补充侵朝部队
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：美国侵略者正加紧训练日蒋匪军，准备送到朝鲜战场，充任海军陆战队。据可靠方面透露：目前在冲绳岛和朝鲜南端的济州岛上有日蒋匪军四个师，正由李奇微总部的军官加以训练。据称：前日军士兵两万五千人与蒋匪士兵五万人已被分批运往冲绳岛及济州岛。前日军军官两千名早在八月间即已迁入冲绳岛上的营房。该地正在整训的各师的步兵营，绝大部分兵员都是由日蒋匪军所组成；至于炮兵和参谋机构，全由美军组成。
    美军为了给侵略朝鲜的部队训练后备军，在冲绳岛上还组成了两个教导团，训练日蒋匪军；教导团由美军巴克勒担任司令。美国驻台军事顾问团团长蔡斯，九月间曾派孙匪立人率领匪军干部一批赴冲绳岛参加训练工作。并传蔡斯于十月底曾赴该岛检阅上述在训练中的日蒋匪军，该部匪军准备即将开赴朝鲜。
    又，李奇微为加紧训练在冲绳岛及台湾的日蒋匪军，已派曾任日寇台湾总督的战犯长谷川（前海军上将）为蒋匪军军事顾问。长谷川将偕前日本海军军官富田上校离东京赴台湾。
