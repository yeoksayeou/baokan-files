　　Wu Ji County Industrial Company Cotton Ginning Factory Should Strengthen Fire Prevention Equipment
    Editor: The Wu Ji County Industrial Company Cotton Ginning Factory in Hebei Province currently has a stock of 500,000 to 600,000 jin of seed cotton, and receives an additional 50,000 to 60,000 jin every day. However, the factory does not have a dedicated warehouse to store such a large quantity of cotton. The fire prevention equipment is also very simple, lacking water tanks, pools, and fire extinguishers. They are currently operating twenty-two cotton gins and can only process more than 20,000 jin of seed cotton per day; even if they no longer receive any seed cotton, based on the existing stock, it would still take more than twenty days to process it all. This will not only affect the completion of the Ding County Textile Company's processing and transportation tasks, but will also directly affect the supply of raw materials to the yarn factories. We have already given the factory our opinion on this matter. I suggest that all cotton collection stations and cotton ginning factories should conduct a general inspection to strengthen fire prevention equipment and actively organize processing efforts in order to complete the processing as soon as possible and avoid accidents.

    Yuan Shi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Attaches Importance to Cotton Protection Work
    Editor: In order to successfully complete this year's cotton collection task, the Yuan Shi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative led and promoted various cotton collection stations and cotton ginning factories in the county to create many methods for cotton protection work. All cotton stations and ginning factories in the county have universally carried out the "three quicks" (quick collection, quick ginning, quick delivery), "three preventions" (fire prevention, anti-special agents, theft prevention), "three inspections" (inspection of cotton collection, screening, and ginning), and "three no storages" (no loose cotton next to the cotton ginning machines; no lint cotton in the ginning rooms; no cotton bales in the warehouse; process as you go, reducing the time spent at the factory) campaign, which has played a significant role in cotton protection work. In early October, the Wei Village cotton collection station discovered half a box of matches while screening cotton. When recruiting ginning and cotton collection staff, the county supply and marketing cooperative cooperated with relevant departments to conduct a serious review. Zhao Longxiang, a ginning worker at the Nantuan Cotton Collection Station, introduced two bad elements who had previously served as special agents and had not yet confessed clearly, who were found and not employed. In terms of fire prevention equipment, many cotton stations and ginning factories have done a good job. Each ginning worker hangs a wet sack on the wall behind them before starting work; each cotton gin also has a wooden dustpan hanging above it, filled with sand, which is convenient to use in case of fire. In addition, there are fire extinguishers, buckets and other fire prevention equipment.
    In addition to regularly inspecting cotton protection work, the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also regularly educates workers on protecting state assets, and proposes in the patriotic pact that no matches or smoking be allowed in cotton ginning factories; relatives and friends who come to visit must be reported to superiors; care for public property and fire-fighting equipment, etc. In short, due to the society's emphasis on cotton protection work and timely inspections, the country's assets have avoided possible losses, ensuring the smooth progress of cotton collection work.

### 无极县实业公司轧花厂应加强防火设备

　　无极县实业公司轧花厂应加强防火设备
    编辑同志：河北无极县实业公司轧花厂现在库存籽棉五、六十万斤，每天还收入五、六万斤。但该厂对于库存和收入这样大数量的棉花，却没有专门的仓库保存。防火设备也很简陋，没有水缸、水池、灭火器。他们现在开着二十二盘轧车，一天只能加工籽棉两万多斤；即使他们不再收入籽棉，就现有的存棉计算，也还要加工二十多天才能全部轧完。这不仅会影响定县花纱布公司加工运输任务的完成，同时也将直接影响对纱厂的原料供应。对此，我们已给该厂提出意见。我建议各地收棉站和轧花厂应普遍进行一次检查，要加强防火设备，并积极组织加工力量，以便早日完成加工，避免发生事故。　定县花纱布公司　赵玉虎
    元氏县供销社重视保棉工作
    编辑同志：元氏县供销社，为了胜利完成今年收棉任务，领导和推动该县各收棉站和轧花厂创造出不少保棉工作办法。全县各棉站、轧花厂，普遍地开展了三快（快收、快轧、快送）、三防（防火、防特、防盗）、三检查（收花、筛花、轧花要检查）、三不存（轧花车跟不存散棉；榨花房不存皮棉；库房不存花包；随有随加工，减少在工厂的停留时间）运动，对保棉工作起了很大作用。十月初，微村收棉站筛花时，检查出火柴半盒。在吸收轧花收花工作人员时，县供销社配合有关部门进行了认真的审查。南团收花站轧花工人赵龙祥，介绍两个过去当过特务、现在还没交代清楚的坏分子，经查出未用。在防火设备上，许多棉站、轧花厂都做得很好，每个轧花工人在上工以前，都在背后墙上挂一个湿麻袋；每辆轧车上边，还挂有一个木簸箕，里头盛上沙土，万一失火，使用起来很方便。此外，还有消火器、水桶等防火设备。
    县供销社除了经常检查保棉工作外，还经常对工人进行保护国家资产的教育，在订立爱国公约中，提出在轧花厂里不带火柴、不吸烟；家属亲朋来找，要向上级报告；爱护公物和防火器材等。总之，由于该社重视保棉工作和及时检查，使国家资财避免了可能的损失，保证了收棉工作的顺利进行。
