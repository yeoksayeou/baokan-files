Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: French "Ce Soir" reporter Béquet reported from Panmunjom on the 6th: The US side put forward a new proposal at the subcommittee meeting on November 5th. Judging from the vague legal vocabulary they used, only one thing is clear: the US side is unwilling to reach an agreement quickly. For more than three months, the issue of the dividing line, coupled with incidents created by the United States, has made it impossible to reach an agreement. When the representatives gathered in the meeting tent on the afternoon of the 5th, if it were not for the stupid American demands regarding Kaesong, the representatives would have been closer to an agreement on the thorny issue of the dividing line than ever before. The Korean-Chinese side put forward a plan to demarcate a dividing line after fair adjustments, or to avoid arguing with the US side by following the line of contact completely without any adjustments. (The US side argued endlessly for Kaesong.) The US side is now forced into a corner, and they can only say "we accept", otherwise they will expose to world public opinion that they do not want an agreement. They chose another path. They put forward a new proposal at the meeting, requesting that the issue of the dividing line be postponed until all other issues on the agenda have been resolved before an agreement is sought. After arguing for more than a week on the exact status of the contact line, they said:
	“Let’s not determine the contact line first, but wait until an agreement is reached on the entire agenda.” They suggested establishing a three-person committee "to determine the objectively agreed-upon boundaries." This is complete nonsense. With the war still raging and the positions sometimes moving forward and sometimes moving backward, no committee or expert can carry out this task. This seems to be the intention of the United States, because they are launching new offensives every day aimed at encircling Kaesong. Their proposal to make "appropriate adjustments" to the contact line means that they will obtain Kaesong at any cost. When the representatives of the Korean-Chinese side asked explicitly "Does 'appropriate adjustment' include Kaesong?", they were silent in the meeting tent. Their new proposal is an attempt to deceive the world and indefinitely delay the resolution of the Korean issue at the moment when they have no room for maneuver on the issue of the dividing line (the most important item on the agenda).

    法国“今晚报”记者贝却敌自朝鲜报道
    美方在分界线问题上已无再耍手段的余地
    所谓新建议仅为无限期延缓解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社六日讯】法国“今晚报”记者贝却敌六日自板门店报道：美方在十一月五日的小组委员会上，提出了新建议。从他们用的空泛的法律辞汇来看，只有一件事是清楚的，那就是，美方不愿意迅速达成协议。三个多月以来，分界线的问题加上美国制造的事件，使得协议无法达成。当代表们五日下午在会议帐篷集会时，如果不是有美国关于开城的愚蠢要求，在分界线这个棘手的问题上，代表们是比任何时候都更接近协议的。朝中方面提出了一个方案，经过公平的调整划定一条分界线，或者完全依照接触线而不作任何调整，这样来避免和美方争论不休。（美方争论不休地要求取得开城。）美方现在被逼到一个墙角，他们只能说“我们接受”，否则就向世界舆论暴露了他们不想要协议。他们选择了另一条道路。他们在会议上提出了新建议，要求把分界线问题延缓到议程上的一切其他问题得到解决时之后再来求得协议。在确定接触线的确切地位这个问题上争论了一个多星期以后，他们说：
    “我们先不确定接触线吧，等到整个议程取得协议时再说。”他们建议成立三人委员会，“来确定客观地双方同意的界限”。这完全是胡说。在战事仍在激烈进行、阵地时而向前时而向后推移的情况下，没有一个委员会和专家能够执行这个任务。似乎这就是美国的意图，因为他们每天都在开展目的在于包围开城的新的进攻。他们所提出的将接触线加以“适当的调整”的建议，意味着他们不惜以任何代价取得开城。当朝中方面的代表明白地问“适当的调整是否包括开城在内”时，他们在会议帐篷里一语不发。他们的新建议是企图当他们在分界线问题
    （议程上最重要的一项）上已没有耍手段的余地的关头，欺世惑人，并无限期地延缓朝鲜问题的解决。
