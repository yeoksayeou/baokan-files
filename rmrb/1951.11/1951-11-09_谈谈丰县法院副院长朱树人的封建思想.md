Discussing the Feudal Ideology of Zhu Shuren, Deputy President of the Feng County Court
	Li Xiceng, President of the Teng County Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court
	Zhu Shuren, Deputy President of the Feng County People's Court in Shandong Province, violated national policies and laws in handling the marriage case between Chen Shouduan and Ms. Hu (Note: details of this case were published on page 3 of this newspaper on October 15th), openly defended the feudal marriage system, and suppressed and deprived women of their right to freedom of marriage. This is an intolerable illegal act. Although the erroneous judgment of the original trial has been corrected by the Teng County Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court through a retrial, I did not fully realize the seriousness of Zhu Shuren's mistakes at the time. Therefore, the retrial was also handled on a case-by-case basis, based on legal provisions. After the *Jinan Dazhong Daily* in Shandong published a commentary on this case on October 7th, and after further study, I had a clearer understanding of this issue. I believe that strictly criticizing Zhu Shuren's mistakes is of great significance for educating Zhu Shuren himself and overcoming the feudal ideology of other judicial cadres.
	According to Zhu Shuren, when handling the case, he had already recognized that Chen Shouduan's acts of buying and selling marriage, bigamy, concubinage, and abuse of his wife were "unreasonable" (more than just unreasonable!). Ms. Hu could divorce Chen Shouduan. However, he emphasized that this kind of unreasonable marriage "was a product left over from the old society" and that Chen Shouduan "married a concubine to have children." Therefore, he believed that "Chen Shouduan should not be regarded as currently committing a crime and punished." The illegal detention of Ms. Hu and Chen Zheng-sheng, and ordering Ms. Hu to make a public self-criticism at a mass meeting in the entire district (no legal basis can be found for this kind of sentence), was because "this case also involved some other tortuous circumstances, and it was necessary to take a case-by-case approach and separate treatment" (the "other tortuous circumstances" he mentioned mainly refer to Chen Shouduan's accusation that his nephew Chen Zheng-sheng abducted Ms. Hu in order to seize his family property). In addition, Ms. Hu married Yang Zuoying without going through formal divorce procedures, which he considered "elope." The reason he ruled that Ms. Hu's daughter, Lunni, should belong to Chen Shouduan was because first, the Marriage Law stipulates that it can be judged "…according to the interests of the children." Chen Shouduan and his wife own more than 20 mu of good land (rich peasant status) and live a wealthy life; while Ms. Hu's remarried husband, Yang Zuoying, lives a poor life and is unable to raise her. Second, because Chen Shouduan is a military dependent, he was afraid that Chen Shouduan would lose both his property and his wife and commit suicide. -- This is Zhu Shuren's thinking!
	First of all, it should be pointed out that the facts of this case are very clear. From beginning to end, the entire case has only one content, that is, Ms. Hu is dissatisfied with her feudal marriage, cannot bear the abuse, and wants to escape from the fire pit and strive for freedom of marriage. Apart from this, there are no "other tortuous circumstances" at all. The so-called "seeking wealth" has no evidence whatsoever. Therefore, Zhu Shuren's argument that it is necessary to "take a case-by-case approach and separate treatment," that is, the so-called "separate handling," is completely untenable. This is just an excuse for him to cover up his mistakes.
	Secondly, because feudal marriage relations are a product of the old society, they should be unconditionally retained. What does this mean? This means that our people's laws should unconditionally recognize all feudal marriage relations. This is absurd. We must never suppress women who demand liberation under the pretext of "products of the old society." If we do this, we are standing on the position of the feudal system. Zhu Shuren is precisely standing on the position of feudalism. In particular, the marriage case between Chen Shouduan and Ms. Hu was not simply caused by past bigamy, concubinage, and buying and selling marriages, but also because Chen Shouduan still inflicts cruel feudal abuse on Ms. Hu. According to the provisions of our national policies and laws, Chen Shouduan's barbarous and cruel behavior is completely illegal and cannot be tolerated. The people's court must never ignore it. Therefore, Zhu Shuren's so-called "Chen Shouduan should not be regarded as currently committing a crime" is completely wrong.
	Thirdly, Zhu Shuren said that the reason why he detained Ms. Hu and Chen Zheng-sheng, ordered Ms. Hu and Yang Zuoying to temporarily not cohabitate, and asked Ms. Hu to publicly reflect and repent, was because Ms. Hu's departure was a so-called "elope," she was "abducted," and the free marriage between Hu and Yang was an "illegal" act. This is a more prominent manifestation of Zhu Shuren standing on the position of the feudal rulers, maintaining the feudal marriage system, suppressing and depriving women of their right to freedom of marriage, and slandering the oppressed people. The facts of this case are very clear: Ms. Hu's departure was for "survival," and Chen Zheng-sheng's behavior was for "saving the dying." However, Zhu Shuren, as a responsible cadre of the people's court, not only had no sympathy for Ms. Hu's suffering and no appreciation for Chen Zheng-sheng's righteous behavior, but also added the unwarranted charges of "abduction" and "elope" to them, illegally detained them, and ordered Ms. Hu to publicly reflect and repent. Isn't this a blatant announcement to all oppressed and abused women: "You are only allowed to endure obediently, you are not allowed to resist, and those who resist will be charged with 'elope'?" The purpose of marriage registration is to examine whether the marriage is reasonable and legal, and the union of Hu and Yang has already been proven to be voluntary, completely legitimate and reasonable. Why not start from supporting their voluntary marriage, let them complete the registration, but instead use the excuse of no registration to overturn it? Moreover, at this time last year, the county's districts and townships had basically not established a marriage registration system. How can it be said that their marriage without registration is "illegal"? This can only show that Zhu Shuren is deliberately looking for excuses to suppress free marriage.
	Fourth, although Zhu Shuren superficially said that he ruled that Lunni should belong to the man in order to "take care of the interests of the children" and "take care of the military dependents," judging from his statement that "marrying a concubine is to have children" and his fear that Chen Shouduan would "lose both his property and his wife," I believe that his feudal ideology is still at work. Originally, the so-called "marrying a concubine is to have children" is a pretext for the feudal ruling class to play with women; but Zhu Shuren, as the deputy president of the county people's court, brought this kind of nonsense to the people's court as an argument for handling cases, defending the feudal and reactionary marriage system! Even if we concede that Zhu Shuren's behavior is truly for the benefit of the children, his basis is still untenable. Because according to the Marriage Law, "Husbands and wives have equal rights of ownership and disposal of family property." Ms. Hu worked as a beast of burden in Chen Shouduan's house for eight or nine years. Shouldn't she be entitled to a share of the property to raise her daughter when she divorces? But Zhu Shuren did not make such a ruling. When he ruled that Lunni should belong to the man, he was unmoved by the scene of Ms. Hu's pain and reluctance! As for the so-called "taking care of the military dependents," it is even more absurd. The people's government and the people should take care of the military dependents, but this does not mean that the father of a revolutionary soldier can refuse to enforce the law. Revolutionary soldiers will not make such unreasonable demands to the government.
	In summary, I believe that Zhu Shuren has completely lost the position that a people's judicial worker should have. Although he is a people's judicial worker, his mind is full of feudal ideas. He tries his best to maintain the barbaric and backward marriage system, meticulously thinking for Chen Shouduan, the representative of the feudal marriage system, while he has no sympathy for women who have suffered cruel abuse. He can compromise and concede to Chen Shouduan's disruption of the court; but he slanders Ms. Hu's departure and pursuit of survival, and finds various excuses to detain Ms. Hu. He does not use the people's legal rights to protect the people, but instead uses them to protect the feudal evil forces and persecute the people. This kind of mistake is intolerable. We must use all effective methods to eliminate this phenomenon.

    谈谈丰县法院副院长朱树人的封建思想
    山东省人民法院滕县分院院长  李希曾
    山东省丰县人民法院副院长朱树人，在处理陈守端与胡氏的婚姻案件（按：此案详情已在十月十五日本报第三版发表）中，违背国家政策法令，公开维护封建婚姻制度，压制与剥夺妇女的婚姻自由权利，这是不能容忍的违法行为。原审的错误判决，虽已由山东省人民法院滕县分院改判纠正，但当时我对朱树人所犯错误的严重性还认识不足，因此在改判时也是就事论事，依据法令条文来处理的。十月七日山东济南大众日报发表了有关这一案件的评论后，经过进一步的学习，我对这一问题才有了比较明确的认识。我认为把朱树人所犯错误予以严格批判，对于教育朱树人本人和克服其他司法干部的封建思想，都有很大的意义。
    据朱树人说，在处理该案时，他已经认识到陈守端的买卖婚姻、重婚、纳妾和虐待妻子的行为是“不合理”（岂只是不合理！）的，胡氏是可以和陈守端离婚的。但他又强调这种不合理的婚姻“是旧社会遗留的产物”，陈守端“娶小纳妾是为了生儿养女”，因此就认为“不应该把陈守端视为现行犯而给予责罚”。非法地扣押胡氏和陈正升，并判令胡氏在全区扩大群众会上公开检讨（这种判处是找不出任何法律根据的），则是因为“这个案件还涉及了一些另外的曲折情况，不得不采取就事论事分割处理的办法”（他所说的“另外的曲折情况”，主要是指陈守端曾控告其侄陈正升为谋夺其家产而拐走胡氏）。另外，胡氏未经正式离婚手续，即与杨作营结婚，他认为这是“私奔”。他之所以把胡氏所生的女儿伦妮判归陈守端，是因为第一、婚姻法上规定可“……根据子女的利益判决之。”陈守端夫妻两人占有好地二十余亩（富农成份），生活富裕；而胡氏再嫁之夫杨作营，生活贫苦，无力抚养。第二、因为陈守端是军属，他怕使陈守端人财两空，寻了短见。——这就是朱树人的思想！
    首先应该指出，该案的案情是十分清晰明朗的。全案从头到尾只有一个内容，那就是胡氏不满于自己的封建婚姻，不堪虐待，要想逃出火坑，争取婚姻自由。除此之外，根本没有什么“另外的曲折情况”。所谓“谋财”，并无任何证据。因此，朱树人所说的需要“采取就事论事、分割处理的办法”，也就是所谓“另案处理”的论据，是完全不能成立的。这只不过是他掩盖自己错误的一种藉口罢了。
    其次，因为封建婚姻关系是旧社会的产物，就无条件地加以保留，这是什么意思呢？这就是说，我们人民的法律应该无条件地承认一切封建的婚姻关系。这是十分荒谬的。我们决不能以“旧社会产物”为藉口，对要求解放的妇女予以压制。如果这样做，那就是站在封建制度的立场上了。朱树人却恰恰站在封建主义的立场上。特别是陈守端与胡氏的婚姻案件，并不是单纯由过去的重婚纳妾和买卖婚姻所引起的，而且是因为陈守端至今仍对胡氏施行残酷的封建虐待。按照我们国家政策法令的规定，陈守端的这种野蛮残酷的行为完全是非法的，不能容许的，人民法院绝对不能不予过问。因此朱树人所谓“不应把陈守端视为现行犯”，是完全错误的。
    第三，朱树人说，他所以扣押胡氏和陈正升，责令胡氏与杨作营暂不得同居，并要胡氏当众反省悔过，是因为胡氏之出走乃是所谓“私奔”，被人“拐逃”，胡杨二人的自由结婚是“违法”行为。这是朱树人站在封建统治者立场、维护封建婚姻制度、压制与剥夺妇女婚姻自由权利、污蔑受压迫人民的更突出的表现。该案的案情十分明白：胡氏的出走是为了“求生”，陈正升的行为是为了“救死”。但是作为人民法院负责干部的朱树人，不但对于胡氏的痛苦没有丝毫同情，对于陈正升的正义行为没有任何嘉许，反而给他们加上莫须有的“拐逃”和“私奔”的罪名，非法地将他们扣押起来，并责令胡氏当众反省悔过，这不是明目张胆地向所有被压迫被虐待的妇女下了严厉的通告“只许你们俯首贴耳地忍受，不许你们反抗，反抗者以‘私奔’论罪”吗？结婚登记的目的是为了审查婚姻是否合理合法，而胡杨二人的结合，已经证明是出于自愿，完全正当合理的，为什么不从支持他们的自愿的婚姻出发，让他们补行登记，反而藉口没有登记而予以推翻呢？况且去年此时该县区乡还基本上没有建立起婚姻登记制度，怎能说他们的结婚没有登记是“违法”呢？这只能说明朱树人是在故意寻找藉口，压制自由结婚。
    第四，朱树人虽然表面上说他把伦妮判归男方，是为了“照顾子女利益”和“照顾军属”，但从他所说的“娶小纳妾是为了生儿养女”和他恐怕陈守端“人财两空”来看，我认为仍然是他的封建思想在作怪。本来所谓“娶小纳妾是为了生儿养女”，谁都知道这是封建统治阶级玩弄女性的藉口；但是身为县人民法院副院长的朱树人，却把这种鬼话搬到人民的法院来作为处理案件的论据，替封建反动的婚姻制度进行辩护！即使我们退一步承认朱树人的行为是真正为了照顾子女的利益，他的根据也是不能成立的。因为按照婚姻法的规定，“夫妻双方对于家庭财产有平等的所有权与处理权”。胡氏在陈守端家作了八、九年的牛马，难道她在离婚时就不应该分得一部分财产去抚养女儿吗？但是朱树人不作这样的判决。他在判决伦妮归于男方时，目睹胡氏痛不欲生、牵衣顿足的情景，是无动于衷的！至于所谓“照顾军属”，更是荒谬之极。人民政府和人民对于军属是要照顾的，但这决不是说革命军人的父亲可以不执行法令。革命军人也不会向政府提出这种不合理的要求的。
    综上所述，我认为朱树人完全丧失了人民司法工作者应有的立场。他虽然是人民司法工作者，但脑子里充满了封建思想。他对野蛮落后的婚姻制度尽力维护，无微不至地为封建婚姻制度的代表者陈守端设想，而对遭受残酷虐待的妇女则没有半点同情。他对陈守端的大闹法庭，可以妥协让步；对胡氏的出走、求生，则予以污蔑，并找寻各种藉口将胡氏扣押起来。他不把人民的法权用来保护人民，反而用来庇护封建恶势力，迫害人民，这种错误是不可容忍的。我们必须用一切有效的办法肃清这种现象。
