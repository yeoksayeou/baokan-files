Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The increased production and thrift movement has gradually unfolded in the vast countryside. Farmers in various regions are warmly responding to Chairman Mao's call, holding meetings to discuss methods for increasing production and practicing thrift, revising patriotic pacts or formulating winter increased production and thrift plans, and actively preparing for next year's patriotic production movement.

According to extremely incomplete statistics, currently 83 mutual aid teams, 142 agricultural labor models, and farmers in many villages in seven provinces and regions, including Henan, Southern Anhui, Hunan, Northern Anhui, Jiangxi, Western Sichuan, and Jilin, have separately formulated specific increased production and thrift plans or revised their patriotic pacts.

After hearing Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, these mutual aid teams, labor models, and farmers immediately held meetings to discuss and mobilize. During the discussions, they further understood the great significance of increasing production and practicing thrift, criticized and corrected the lax and wasteful thinking of some farmers after this year's bumper harvest and the completion of the increased production and donation plan, cleared the ideological obstacles to carrying out the increased production and thrift movement, and formulated increased production and thrift plans or revised patriotic pacts based on the specific conditions of each group and region.

The increased production and thrift plans or revised patriotic pacts formulated by these mutual aid teams, labor models, and farmers generally include the following: 1. In terms of increased production: the first is to strengthen this year's winter production work to prepare for next year's production. They have all stipulated in their respective plans or pacts that they will expand the area of winter planting, universally carry out winter plowing, build farmland water conservancy projects, accumulate manure and fertilizer, develop various sideline productions according to local conditions, and use the income from sideline production to add livestock and farm tools this winter. For example, the Chen Yike mutual aid team in Jiangxi Province decided to plant all 283 mu of dry land that can be planted in winter with fertilizer grass, rapeseed, and barley, plow all the paddy fields before the end of the year, and renovate and newly dig seven ponds. The Han En mutual aid team stipulated that after the threshing is completed, the entire team's personnel and vehicles will immediately invest in sideline production, using the income from sideline production to add vehicles and buy horses. All the farmers in Tushan Village, Xuancheng County, Southern Anhui Province, planned: most of the village's fields will be planted with winter crops; winter fallow fields will be winter plowed; this winter, 90 dan of pond mud will be prepared for each mu of farmland in the village; winter sideline production will be carried out to ensure that every household has no idle people. The second is to strive to increase the unit area yield next year. For example, the farmers of Xinglong Village, Shiba Township, Nan County, Hunan Province, plan to strive to increase the unit area yield of all the village's farmland next year by 10 to 15 percent on the basis of this year's bumper harvest. In order to achieve this goal, the villagers will prepare for next year's production this winter, and implement intensive cultivation, increased fertilization, weeding and pest control, and the selection of fine seeds next year. In order to increase the unit area yield next year, the Su Dianxuan mutual aid team in Henan Province plans to hoe the wheat fields once before the Spring Festival and apply two carts of topdressing fertilizer per mu; at the same time, plow the winter fallow land twice, harrow it four times, and accumulate 150 carts of fertilizer for spring planting. 2. In terms of thrift: the main thing is to live a careful and frugal life, oppose extravagance and waste, and invest the savings in production. For example, the winter increased production and thrift plan of the farmers in Tangzhen Township, Dayi County, Western Sichuan District, stipulates: do not rush to the market when there is nothing to do, sit in teahouses less, oppose eating and drinking, and strive to save 100 million yuan in the township to be used for production. The farmers in Tushan Village, Xuancheng County, Southern Anhui District, guarantee to be careful and frugal everywhere, not to burn incense and paper, and to save as much as possible when holding weddings and funerals, and to use the money saved for production. The farmers in Xinglong Village, Nan County, Hunan Province, decided to strive to save 27,000 jin of rice before the autumn harvest next year; not to distill wine or cook sugar, save food, and invest in production. In addition, they also stipulated that they should do a good job in preferential treatment work, and should often study current affairs and politics to improve their political awareness.

Now, the above-mentioned mutual aid teams, labor models, and farmers have begun to take action to realize their plans. For example, the Chen Yike mutual aid team in Jiangxi Province has completed the winter planting plan five days early, and has freed up manpower to repair dikes, most of the paddy fields have been plowed, sideline production has been launched, and four ploughing cattle have been bought with the income from selling surplus grain. The farmers of Guangfu Village in the suburbs of Wuhu City have cultivated the entire village's fields twice by exchanging labor for livestock. Many farmers who were not accustomed to winter planting in the past have planted wheat and rapeseed this year. The land of all military families in the village has also been planted with winter crops in a timely manner.

    广大农民热烈响应毛主席号召
    订出具体增产节约计划
    加紧冬季生产争取提高明年单位面积产量
    【新华社二十八日讯】增产节约运动已在广大农村中逐渐展开。各地农民热烈响应毛主席的号召，纷纷集会讨论增产节约的办法，并修订了爱国公约或制订了冬季增产节约计划，积极为明年的爱国生产运动作好准备。
    据极不完整的统计，目前全国已有河南、皖南、湖南、皖北、江西、川西、吉林等七个省区的八十三个互助组、一百四十二位农业劳动模范和许多乡村的农民，分别订出了具体的增产节约计划或修订了爱国公约。
    这些互助组、劳动模范和农民，听到毛主席关于增加生产、厉行节约以支持中国人民志愿军的号召后，都立即开会讨论，进行动员。在讨论中，他们更进一步了解了增产节约的伟大意义，批判和纠正了部分农民在今年丰收和完成增产捐献计划后所产生的松懈浪费思想，清除了开展增产节约运动的思想障碍，并根据各组、各地的具体情况，订出了增产节约计划或修订了爱国公约。
    这些互助组、劳动模范和农民所订的增产节约计划或修订以后的爱国公约，大体包括以下内容：一、在增产方面：首先是加强今年冬季的生产工作，为明年的生产作好准备。他们都在各自的计划或公约中规定：要在今冬扩大冬种面积，普遍进行冬耕，兴修农田水利，积攒粪肥，因地制宜地开展各种副业生产，并以副业生产的收入添置牲畜农具。如江西省陈翊科互助组决定把可以冬种的二百八十三亩旱地全部种上肥田草、油菜和大麦，年底以前把全部水田耕完，并整修和新挖水塘七口。韩恩互助组规定：打完场以后，全组的人马车辆立即投入副业生产，用副业生产的收入添车买马。皖南宣城县土山村全体农民计划：全村大部田地都种冬季作物；冬闲田都冬耕；今冬为全村的每亩农田准备好九十担塘泥；开展冬季副业生产，保证家家没闲人。其次是争取提高明年的单位面积产量。如湖南省南县石坝乡兴隆村农民计划明年全村农田的单位面积产量，要争取在今年丰收的基础上提高百分之十到十五。为达到这一目标，全村农民要在今冬为明年的生产作好准备，并在明年实行精耕细作、增施肥料、除草防虫、选用良种。河南省苏殿选互助组为提高明年的单位面积产量，计划在春节前普锄麦田一次，每亩追肥两车；同时将冬闲地普遍耕二遍，耙四遍，积肥一百五十车，以备春种之用。二、在节约方面：主要是要精打细算过日子，反对铺张浪费，并以节约所得投入生产。如川西区大邑县唐镇乡农民的冬季增产节约计划规定：无事不赶场，少坐茶馆，反对大吃大喝，争取全乡节约一亿元用在生产上面。皖南区宣城县土山村农民保证处处精打细算，不烧香纸，办红白喜事也要尽量节省，把节省下来的钱用到生产上去。湖南省南县兴隆村农民决定：争取在明年秋收前节省食粮大米二万七千斤；不蒸酒、不熬糖，节约粮食，投入生产。此外，他们还规定要作好优抚工作，并要经常学习时事、政治，以提高政治觉悟。
    现在，上述地区的互助组、劳动模范和农民们，已为实现自己的计划而开始行动起来。如江西省陈翊科互助组的冬种计划已提早五天完成，并已腾出人力去修堤，水田已大部耕完，副业生产已经展开，并以出卖余粮的收入买进耕牛四头。芜湖市郊广福村的农民，已用人畜换工的办法，将全村的田地耕了两遍。许多过去不习惯冬种的农民，今年都种上了麦子和菜子。全村军属的地也都及时种上了冬季作物。
