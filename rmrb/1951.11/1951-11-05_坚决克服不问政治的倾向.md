    Resolutely Overcome the Tendency of Not Caring About Politics
    Shi Jingtang, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Xuzhou Municipal Committee

    The CPC Xuzhou Municipal Committee of Shandong recently held a meeting of party branch committee members and above, and initially examined the tendency of cadres not caring about politics.

    I. Manifestations of the Tendency of Not Caring About Politics

    Where it exists:

    The Patriotic Pacts lack political content. Many units, especially enterprises, draft Patriotic Pacts that mostly lack political content. For example, the South Train Inspection Team C of the Xuzhou Railway Sub-bureau's Vehicle Inspection Section drafted nineteen Patriotic Pacts in July, of which eleven had no political content. The ten security service teams of the East Station Service Area did not mention a single word about the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' "June 1st" Three Major Appeals in their Patriotic Pacts.

    Cadres generally neglect political study. The Municipal Committee recently held a political common sense test, with the participation of 125 staff members from party and government organs, people's organizations, and enterprises. Only three people fully answered the question "What are the three patriotic appeals?" The rest either answered incorrectly or incompletely. Only three people fully answered the question "What are the obligations of citizens of the People's Republic of China?"

    Regarding leading cadres, they only pay attention to completing tasks and neglect political leadership. Some leading comrades even think in their minds, "Completing tasks is first, professional learning is second, and political learning is third." The leading cadres of the Tax Bureau do not care about the learning of on-the-job cadres and assign ordinary cadres or Youth League members to lead it. Judging from the learning results, often the bureau chief is not as good as the section chief, and the section chief is not as good as the staff member. According to the Tax Bureau's test results on united front learning, most cadres above the section chief level failed. There are also individual units where leading cadres never participate in political learning.

    In terms of school education, they misinterpret the instructions from higher authorities on correcting the chaotic phenomenon in school education, turning the act of minimizing students' participation in social and political activities into prohibiting or preventing students from participating in social and political activities. Some schools even openly say, "The reason our school is not doing well is that the ones in gray uniforms (referring to the Youth League cadres) often come to our school and mess things up." More seriously, some schools even propose to cancel political classes. The explanation of this group of people is: "Having culture means having politics." Therefore, the following saying is currently popular among students: "Learn math, physics, and chemistry well, and you won't have to worry about food." This is a problem worth noting.

    Regarding technical engineering personnel, some believe that they are not afraid of anything with technology, thus they belittle political work cadres. Some even believe that "Technology is everything, technology can rule the world, politics is empty, technology is real, learning politics is easy, learning technology is difficult, technology is the ultimate goal of politics." The Electrical Engineering Section of the Jiawang Coal Mine uses production as an excuse to prevent workers from participating in political activities.

    II. What are the Harms of the Tendency of Not Caring About Politics?

    Judging from the above materials, the tendency of not caring about politics among cadres and staff in various departments of Xuzhou is very serious and extremely common. In our actual work, it has been proven that the harm of this tendency of not caring about politics is very great. Due to the lack of political education, some cadres have lost their way in their progress, and some have even developed to the point of degeneration. According to statistics over the past two years, as many as 109 cadres have been disciplined for errors such as violating policies and seeking pleasure and corruption. In industrial production, due to the existence of the tendency of not caring about politics and the purely technical viewpoint, the rationalization proposals of the working masses are rejected, resulting in rework and waste in production, causing great losses to national assets. For example, recently, the two compressors installed in the Xiaqiao Well of the Jiawang Coal Mine wasted national assets by failing to accept the opinions of the working masses. In the Party's propaganda work, due to the existence of the tendency of not caring about politics, some comrades are unwilling to study theories and policies, are self-righteous, and carry out propaganda incorrectly. For example, regarding the issue of labor-capital mutual benefit, some comrades incorrectly promoted that: "Labor-capital mutual benefit should not be half a catty and eight taels, it should be ten taels for labor and six taels for capital." In summary, the tendency of not caring about politics has harmed our actual work!

    III. Why Does the Tendency of Not Caring About Politics Arise?

    Why does the tendency of not caring about politics arise? It has its social foundation and ideological roots. One situation is that non-proletarian ideas have invaded the minds of some comrades in the Party. Another situation is that after the victory, some Party member cadres have undergone some changes in their ideological emotions, such as pride, seeing themselves as meritorious officials, stagnating and not seeking progress, and seeking pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life again; more importantly, we have not seriously conducted systematic and regular education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought within the Party, subjectively relaxed political and ideological leadership, and failed to conduct systematic education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among cadres and Party members. Therefore, some cadres do not have high class consciousness and lack a long-term political vision. Some leading cadres also mistakenly believe that construction can be carried out without political interference—a purely technical viewpoint, an economic viewpoint, and a failure to clearly recognize that today's various tasks and construction are all to consolidate and develop the new democratic system and create conditions for the future construction of socialist and communist society. As a result, a serious tendency of not caring about politics has arisen. The so-called tendency of not caring about politics is essentially a reflection of the intrusion of vulgar bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological styles into the Party.

    IV. How to Overcome the Tendency of Not Caring About Politics?

    How to overcome the tendency of not caring about politics? First, all Party members and cadres should be made to clearly recognize the harm of the tendency of not caring about politics, and a thorough examination should be conducted to expose the harm of the tendency of not caring about politics to the cause of the Party and the people, and correct criticism and self-criticism should be launched to educate all Party members and cadres. Cause the whole Party to attach importance to and be vigilant. At the same time, appropriate commendations should also be given to those departments and leading cadres who pay attention to political and ideological leadership and have made achievements. In this way, it is not only passive accusations, but also active guidance on how to overcome the tendency of not caring about politics.

    Second, strengthen ideological and political leadership. Leading cadres should place ideological and political leadership above all work. When arranging work, cadres should not only be satisfied with completing tasks, but also clearly recognize the purpose of the task.

    Third, systematically carry out the propaganda and education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, create a strong political atmosphere, and make Party members consciously strive to learn. Resolute struggles must be carried out against all phenomena that harm the interests of the Party, both inside and outside the Party. This is a condition that every Communist Party member should and must have.

    Fourth, the struggle against the tendency of not caring about politics must be carried out correctly under the leadership of the Party committee, and it must be carried out in depth at all levels and gradually promoted. At the same time, it must be recognized that this is an ideological work, and the problem cannot be solved with just one education. Therefore, one must not be eager to achieve quick results. Otherwise, it is easy to produce malpractices and fail to achieve the desired effect.

    As long as the leadership pays attention and takes effective measures, the tendency of not caring about politics can be completely overcome.

### 坚决克服不问政治的倾向

    坚决克服不问政治的倾向
    中共徐州市委宣传部部长　史敬棠
    中共山东徐州市委最近召开了一次党的总支委员以上干部会议，初步检查了干部中存在的不问政治的倾向。
    一、不问政治的倾向表现
    在那里
    在订立爱国公约方面，缺乏政治内容。不少单位，特别是企业部门，订立的爱国公约多半缺乏政治内容。如徐州铁路分局检车段南列检丙组，七月份订立了十九份爱国公约，其中就有十一份毫无政治内容。东车站勤务区十个治安服务队所订立的爱国公约，对于抗美援朝总会“六一”三大号召的内容却一字未提。
    干部一般忽视政治学习。市委最近曾举行一次政治常识测验，有党、政机关，人民团体及企业部门工作人员一百二十五人参加。对于“三项爱国号召是什么”一题，完全答对的只有三人。其余的不是答错就是答得不完整。对“中华人民共和国国民的义务是什么”一题，完全答对的也仅有三人。
    在领导干部方面，只注意完成任务，忽视政治领导。有的领导同志在思想上竟认为“完成任务第一，业务学习第二，政治学习第三。”税务局的领导干部竟不管在职干部的学习，而交给一般干部或团员来领导。从学习成绩上看，往往是局长不如科长，科长不如干事。据税务局对统一战线学习的测验结果看，科长以上干部大部分不及格。也有个别单位，领导干部从来就不参加政治学习。
    在学校教育方面，曲解上级机关关于纠正学校教育混乱现象的指示，竟把尽量减少学生参加社会政治活动，变而为不准或阻止学生参加社会政治活动。有的学校竟公开地讲：“我们的学校搞不好，就是因为穿灰制服的（指青年团的干部）常来我们学校搞坏的。”更严重的是，有的学校竟提出把政治课取消。这一部分人的说法是：“有文化就有政治。”因此，目前学生中流行着这样一句话：“学好数理化，吃饭不用怕。”这是值得注意的一个问题。
    在技术工程人员方面，有的认为有了技术什么都不怕，因而轻视政治工作干部。有的竟认为“技术就是一切，技术可以统治天下，政治是空的，技术是实的，学习政治容易，学习技术难，技术是政治的归宿。”贾汪煤矿电机科，则藉口生产不让工人参加政治活动。
    二、不问政治的倾向有那
    些危害
    从上面的材料来看，徐州市各部门干部及工作人员中不问政治的倾向是很严重的，而且是极普遍的。在我们实际工作中，已经证明了这种不问政治倾向的危害性是很大的。由于缺乏政治教育，部分干部在前进中迷失了方向，甚至个别的发展到蜕化变质。据两年来的统计，干部中因违犯政策、享乐腐化等错误，受到处分的竟达一百零九人之多。在工业生产中，由于存在不问政治的倾向和单纯技术观点，拒绝工人群众的合理化建议，造成生产上返工浪费，使国家资财遭到极大损失。如最近贾汪煤矿夏桥井装安压缩机两部，未能接受工人群众的意见，即浪费了国家的资财。在党的宣传工作上，由于存在不问政治倾向，部分同志不愿学习理论政策，自以为是，错误地滥行宣传。如对劳资两利的问题，有的同志竟错误宣传说：“劳资两利，不能是一个半斤一个八两，应当是劳方十两，资方六两。”总起来说，不问政治的倾向，已危害到我们的实际工作了！
    三、为什么产生不问政治
    的倾向
    为什么会产生不问政治的倾向呢？这是有着它的社会基础及思想根源的。一种情况是由于非无产阶级的思想侵入到党内某些同志的思想中。另一种情况是，胜利以后，一部分党员干部当中，思想情绪上发生了若干变化，如骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪等等；更主要的是我们没有认真在党内进行系统的经常的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育，主观上放松了政治、思想领导，未能在干部党员中进行系统的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教育。因之，部分干部阶级觉悟不高，缺乏远大的政治眼光。有的领导干部也错误地认为建设可以抛开政治不管——单纯技术观点，经济观点，没有明确认识到今天的各种工作与建设，都是为巩固与发展新民主主义制度，并为将来建设社会主义与共产主义社会创造条件。结果就产生了严重的不问政治倾向。所谓不问政治的倾向，实质上就是庸俗的资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想作风侵入党内的反映。
    四、如何克服不问政治的
    倾向
    如何克服不问政治的倾向呢？首先，应使全体党员干部，明确认识到不问政治倾向的危害性，要进行一次深入的检查，揭发不问政治的倾向给党与人民事业的危害，展开正确的批评与自我批评，以教育全体党员干部。引起全党的重视与警惕。同时，对于那些注意政治思想领导并做出成绩的部门与领导干部，也应作适当的表扬。这样，就不仅是消极的指责，而且是积极地指导如何去克服不问政治倾向。
    其次，要加强思想政治领导。领导干部应将思想政治领导，放在一切工作之上。布置工作时，要使干部不仅以完成任务为满足，还要明确认识到这一任务的目的所在。
    第三，要系统地进行马克思列宁主义及毛泽东思想的宣传与教育，造成一种浓厚的政治空气，使党员自觉地努力学习。对党内党外一切损害党的利益的现象，必须进行坚决的斗争。这是每个共产党员所应该和必须具有的条件。
    第四，反对不问政治倾向的斗争，必须在党委的领导下正确进行。并按级深入，逐步推广。同时必须认识：这是一项思想工作，绝不是一次教育就能解决问题的。因此，不能急于求成。否则，容易产生流弊，收不到应有的效果。
    只要领导上注意，采取有效的办法，不问政治的倾向是完全能够克服的。
