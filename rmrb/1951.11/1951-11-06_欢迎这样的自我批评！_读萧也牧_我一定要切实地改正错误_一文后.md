    Welcome Such Self-Criticism!
    ——After Reading Xiao Yemu's "I Must Conscientiously Correct My Mistakes"
    Editor's Note: After our newspaper published Comrade Xiao Yemu's article "I Must Conscientiously Correct My Mistakes" on October 26th, we successively received letters from readers Gu Yongzhang, Ji Xu, Shi Ruoping, Zhao Fuxiang, Che Tian, Yang Zhecheng, Zhou Rentiao, Yu Jicheng, Zhen Yu, Deng Guoxin, Zhou Zongda, Mao Zhihan, Cheng Minghao, Duan Lian, Fang Lanxi, Wang Ziyuan, Sun Jingxi, and others, all expressing welcome for such relatively serious self-criticism, and believing that they received education from Comrade Xiao Yemu's self-criticism. Below are excerpts from three of the letters.
    Xiao Yemu's Attitude of Self-Criticism is Correct
    Xiao Yemu's self-criticism "I Must Conscientiously Correct My Mistakes" has been published, which is one of the noteworthy things in the current literary movement.
    Xiao Yemu recognizes in his self-examination that the fundamental reason why he made mistakes is that his petty-bourgeois standpoint, viewpoint, and ideology have not been effectively transformed; that he "burdened himself with the baggage of a 'writer'," "wore the cloak of the proletariat, sold petty-bourgeois merchandise, and was completely unaware of it." The author's self-criticism is pertinent, and he has found the root cause of the errors. The author's demand for himself to "conscientiously transform" and "thoroughly remold myself to obtain a genuine proletarian standpoint" is a correct attitude, worthy of welcome and promotion. I think all literary and art workers should learn from Comrade Xiao Yemu's spirit of daring to self-criticize and work in a down-to-earth manner, so that it is possible to "obtain a genuine proletarian standpoint" and write healthy works.

    I Received Education from the Criticism of Xiao Yemu's Thought
    I was one of those who were influenced by Xiao Yemu's novel "Between Us Husband and Wife" in the past. I was once intoxicated by the descriptions of those trivial details of life. The main reason why it could influence me was that my untransformed petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings resonated with the author's petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings. It was only after the "People's Daily", "Literary Gazette", "China Youth" and other newspapers and periodicals launched criticism of Xiao Yemu's writing tendencies that I suddenly woke up. Today his review has further educated me. I think this kind of thought is not individual among young intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin, but exists in large quantities and universally. On the ideological front, carrying out the struggle between proletarian ideology and non-proletarian ideology, and educating young intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons to seriously transform themselves, is very necessary. From this criticism of Xiao Yemu's works, many people who initially liked his works, like me, have been educated. I hope this kind of criticism can be carried out regularly.

    I Saw My Own Petty-Bourgeois Thoughts and Feelings Reflected
    After reading Comrade Xiao Yemu's self-criticism, I thought of myself. My petty-bourgeois idea of climbing upwards led me to want to become a writer. After reading Xiao Yemu's review, I woke up. I saw myself reflected in the mirror of his self-criticism. From now on, I must also be determined to transform my petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings, so that I can train myself into a proletarian fighter.

    欢迎这样的自我批评！
    ——读萧也牧“我一定要切实地改正错误”一文后
    编者按：本报十月二十六日发表了萧也牧同志的“我一定要切实地改正错误”一文后，连续收到顾永章、纪煦、史若平、赵复骧、车田、杨哲城、周人倜、俞纪诚、甄禹、邓国鑫、周宗达、毛智汉、成明灏、锻炼、方兰溪、王滋源、孙景溪等读者来信，一致表示欢迎这样比较严肃的自我批评，并认为从萧也牧同志的自我批评中，受到了教育。下面是其中三封信的摘要。
    萧也牧自我批评的态度是正确的
    萧也牧的自我批评“我一定要切实地改正错误”已经发表了，这是目前文艺运动中值得注意的事情之一。
    萧也牧在检讨中认识到，他之所以犯错误，根本原因是因为他的小资产阶级立场、观点、思想还没有切实改造；是他“自己背上‘作家’的包袱”，
    “披着无产阶级的外衣，出卖小资产阶级的货色，而毫无自知之明”。作者的自我批评是中肯的，他找出了错误的根源。作者对自己要求“切实地改造”，“脱胎换骨地改造自己，取得真正的无产阶级的立场”，这种态度是正确的，是值得欢迎与提倡的。我觉得一切文艺工作者都应该学习萧也牧同志勇于自我批评的精神，脚踏实地地做去，才有可能“取得真正无产阶级的立场”，写出健康的作品来。    山东大学校刊室

    我从对萧也牧思想的批评中受到了教育
    我过去是受萧也牧的小说“我们夫妇之间”影响的一个人。我曾陶醉在那种繁琐的生活细节的描写中。它之所以能对我发生影响，主要原因是我的未经改造的小资产阶级的思想、感情，和作者的小资产阶级思想、感情起了共鸣。从“人民日报”、“文艺报”、“中国青年”等报刊对萧也牧写作的倾向展开批评后，才使我猛然醒来。今天他的检讨更教育了我。我觉得这种思想，在目前小资产阶级出身的青年知识分子中，并不是个别的，而是大量普遍地存在着的。在思想战线上，开展无产阶级思想与非无产阶级思想的斗争，教育小资产阶级出身的青年知识分子以马列主义、毛泽东思想作武器，来认真改造自己，这是很必要的。从这次对萧也牧作品的批评中，有许多像我一样最初喜爱他的作品的人都受到了教育。希望这种批评能够经常进行。
    一读者
    我照出了自己的小资产阶级思想感情
    我看了萧也牧同志的自我批评后，联想到了自己。我的小资产阶级向上爬的思想主使我想成为一个作家。看了萧也牧的检讨，我醒悟了。我从他的自我批评的镜子中照出了自己。我从现在起也要下定决心改造我的小资产阶级的思想、感情，使自己能锻炼成一个无产阶级的战士。
