The large amount of industrial equipment transported from the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries has helped Shanghai's industrial production to accelerate its recovery and development.

The industrial equipment from the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries began to arrive in Shanghai successively since the summer of this year; the recent arrivals have increased even more. These include various types of steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, dyes, instruments and machinery equipment, all of which are urgently needed for Shanghai's current industrial production. For example, in order to support basic construction in various regions, nail-making and wire-drawing industries need to increase production. Because of the widespread use of wire rod raw materials transported from the Soviet Union, output has increased by 30% compared to two months ago. The textile machinery industry, which has accepted a large number of orders from the state, has solved the problem of insufficient tool equipment after adopting shaping machines and gantry planers transported from Czechoslovakia. Shanghai's paper mills have been able to manufacture smooth and suitable paper by mixing Soviet wood pulp with domestic bamboo pulp. Due to the sufficient supply of raw materials, Shanghai's paper industry production in September broke the historical record. Other industrial raw materials, such as zinc oxide powder needed for the rubber industry and pharmaceutical industry, high-speed tool steel needed for the machinery industry, and zinc sheets needed for the battery industry, have also begun to be supplied by the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. These industrial raw materials are of excellent quality and uniform specifications and have been widely praised.

The large amount of industrial equipment imported from the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries not only supported the recovery and development of Shanghai's industrial production and broke the "blockade" and "embargo" of American imperialism, but also played a significant role in reducing industrial costs and stabilizing the market prices of major industrial equipment because the prices are much lower than the general market prices. After receiving the above-mentioned imported products, the listed prices of the Shanghai branches of the China Industrial Equipment Company have been reduced several times. For example, the listed prices of various steel hardware have generally decreased by 9% to 40%. The market prices of Shanghai's major industrial equipment have gradually returned to the level of June and July, following the price reductions of state-owned enterprises.

After receiving this significant assistance, the workers in each factory greatly increased their production enthusiasm. After accepting the task of comprehensive processing, the workers of the Shanghai Nail Factory reasonably adjusted the labor organization, carefully saved Soviet wire rod, and increased the output of nail production in October by more than 150% compared to the previous period. Ji Haoran, a labor model at the Jiangnan Paper Mill, recently improved the lubrication device on the paper machine and estimated that he could increase the production value equivalent to a fighter plane in half a year. He said, "Brother countries are helping us from thousands of miles away. How can we not work harder ourselves?"

    苏联和新民主主义国家运来大量器材
    帮助上海工业加速恢复发展
    苏联和新民主主义国家源源运来的大量工业器材，帮助了上海工业生产加速恢复和发展。
    苏联和新民主主义国家的工业器材，自今年夏季开始，即已陆续运到上海；最近到货更为增多。其中包括各种钢铁、有色金属、化工原料、染料、仪器及机器设备等，都为目前上海工业生产所急需。例如为支持各地基本建设而需要增加生产的制钉、拉丝工业，因为广泛采用了苏联运来的盘元原料，产量已比两月前提高了百分之三十。接受国家大批订货的纺织机器工业，采用了由捷克运来的牛头刨床、龙门刨床等以后，工具设备不足的困难已得到解决。上海各造纸厂混合采用苏联木浆和国产竹浆的结果，已能制造光洁合用的纸张。由于原料供应充分，九月份上海造纸工业生产已突破历史上的最高纪录。其他如橡胶工业、制药工业所需的锌氧粉，机器工业所需的高速工具钢，电池工业所需的锌皮等，苏联和新民主主义国家也都已开始供应，这些工业原料，品质优良，规格统一，都受到普遍赞誉。
    这些由苏联和新民主主义国家输入的大量工业器材，不但支援了上海工业生产的恢复和发展，打破了美帝国主义的“封锁”和“禁运”，而且因为价格远低于一般市价，对于减低工业成本和稳定主要工业器材的市场价格方面，也起了重大作用。在接到上述输入的产品以后，中国工业器材公司上海各分公司的牌价即几经下降。如各种钢铁五金的牌价一般都下降了百分之九到百分之四十。上海各主要工业器材的市场价格，随着国营企业牌价的挂低，也逐渐恢复到六七月间的水平。
    各厂工人在获得了这种重大的援助以后，生产热情大为提高。上海制钉厂工人接受了全面加工任务之后，即合理调整劳动组织，细心节用苏联盘元，并使十月份制钉的产量较前提高了百分之一百五十以上。江南造纸厂劳动模范计浩然最近改进了造纸机上的润滑装置，估计半年就可以增产价值相当于一架战斗机的产品。他说：“兄弟国家这样千里迢迢地帮助我们，我们自己还能不更努力吗？”
