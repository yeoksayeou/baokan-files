Brief Commentary on Party Life

    Is the saying "Forced Orders Combined with Mass Voluntarism" Correct?

    It is already common knowledge that commandism must be opposed. However, there are still some Party cadres who are defending commandism. For example, in the Xuchang Special District, individual members of the CCP County Committee said: "For tasks with short timeframes and urgent demands, forced or semi-forced methods can be adopted – this is called forced orders combined with mass voluntarism." The CCP Xin County Third District Committee in Pingyuan Province also defended the commandist style of some cadres, saying: "When emotions are high, you can't pour cold water on them. We must understand the difficulties of village cadres; work must be done, and mistakes will be made." These statements are clearly wrong. Difficulties in work can never be solved by forced orders; this will not solve them. In the past, many cadres adopted forced orders to solve difficulties in their work, which led to dissatisfaction among the masses. This shows that the result of forced orders can only alienate us from the masses and increase difficulties in our work. As for what the leading cadres of the Third District Committee of Xin County, Pingyuan Province, said, "When emotions are high, you can't pour cold water on them!" this is also incorrect. Here, we must first ask what kind of emotions are being referred to? Why can't cold water be poured on the forced command "emotions" of certain cadres? Wouldn't pouring cold water on them help them to wake up sooner and honestly learn to follow the mass line?

    Starting from a purely "task-oriented viewpoint," taking a tolerant and forgiving attitude towards commandism will only encourage the commandist style of certain Party and non-Party cadres, allowing them to use the excuse of urgent tasks and backward masses to implement forced orders. This is commandism's "air-raid shelter," which must be quickly blocked, otherwise it will be impossible to eliminate the commandist style.

    党的生活简评
    “强迫命令与群众自愿结合”的
    说法对吗？
    命令主义必须反对，这已经是人所共知的了。但是，现在却仍然有某些党员干部在替命令主义作辩护。例如许昌专区即有个别中共县委委员说：“对时间短、任务急的工作，可以采用强迫或半强迫的办法——这叫强迫命令与群众自愿结合。”中共平原省莘县三区区委也为某些干部的强迫命令作风辩护说：“情绪起来啦，不能泼冷水，咱们要知道村干部的困难，工作要干，错误要犯。”这些说法显然是错误的。工作中的困难，决不能用强迫命令的办法来解决，这是解决不了的。过去有不少干部就因为采用强迫命令方法来解决工作中的困难，以致遭到群众的不满，这就说明，强迫命令的结果，只能使我们脱离群众，增加工作中的困难。至于平原省莘县三区领导干部说的，“情绪起来啦，不能泼冷水！”这也是不对的。这里先得问问是什么样的情绪？对于某些干部的强迫命令“情绪”为什么不能泼冷水呢？给他们泼一盆冷水不是可以使他们早一点清醒过来，而去老实地学习走群众路线吗？
    从单纯“任务观点”出发，对命令主义采取纵容姑息和原谅的态度，只会助长某些党与非党干部的命令主义作风，使他们更可以藉口任务紧急，群众落后，施行强迫命令。这是命令主义的“防空洞”，必须迅速堵塞，否则是不可能肃清命令主义作风的。
