    Beijing Catholic Reform Committee
    Requests Government Takeover of Ren Ci Tang (Benevolence Hall)

    On November 28th, the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee submitted a document to the Beijing Municipal People's Government requesting the takeover of Ren Ci Tang (Benevolence Hall). The document stated: "The 'Ren Ci Tang' in Xishiku, Beijing, is a slaughterhouse where Vincentian (Lazarist) imperialist elements, exploiting the poverty of the Chinese people in the old society, used the guise of 'benevolence' to harm China's future generations. These imperialist elements abused and beat orphaned children, and forced them to engage in labor like cattle and horses, leaving them without adequate clothing and food. Over the past eighty-nine years, more than 23,400 Chinese children have been killed in this dark hell. From this shocking number, we can see the crimes committed by imperialist elements against children in our country." The document stated: "Our Beijing Catholic believers, after the reform movement, have held various large and small accusation meetings. At the Catholic Reform Representative Conference on September 16th and 17th, fellow Catholics and orphans from 'Ren Ci Tang' accused the imperialist elements of 'Ren Ci Tang' of their bloody crimes. All the representatives at the conference expressed immense outrage and unanimously demanded that the government take over 'Ren Ci Tang' to save the orphans. Representing more than 20,000 patriotic and religious Catholic believers in Beijing, our committee requests the People's Government to avenge the dead orphans, severely punish these imperialist elements who engage in aggression under the cloak of religion, and swiftly take over 'Ren Ci Tang' so that the orphans who are still in dire straits can be liberated."
    Li Junwu, the Bishop of the North Church in Beijing, and twenty-two other priests also jointly requested the Beijing Municipal People's Government to take over Ren Ci Tang.

    北京市天主教革新委员会
    请求政府接管仁慈堂
    北京市天主教革新委员会于十一月二十八日具文呈请北京市人民政府接管仁慈堂。呈文称：“北京西什库‘仁慈堂’，系遣使会帝国主义分子，利用中国旧社会人民的贫穷，假借‘仁慈’的招牌，残害中国后一代的杀人工厂。帝国主义分子，虐待毒打孤苦孩子，并迫使孤儿从事牛马的劳役而衣不蔽体，食不果腹。八十九年来，在这黑暗地狱中残杀了我国儿童二万三千四百余人。从这惊人的数字，可以看出帝国主义分子在我国残害儿童的罪行。”呈文称：“我们北京市天主教徒经过革新运动，曾召开了大小不同的控诉会。在九月十六日十七日两日天主教革新代表会议上，皆有教友及‘仁慈堂’的孤儿控诉‘仁慈堂’帝国主义分子的血腥罪行，在代表会议上全体代表表示无比愤恨，一致要求政府接管‘仁慈堂’拯救孤儿。本会代表两万余天主教爱国爱教教友，要求人民政府为死难的孤儿报仇，严厉惩办这些身披宗教外衣进行侵略的帝国主义分子，迅速接管‘仁慈堂’，使尚在水深火热中的孤儿得到解放。”
    北京市天主教北堂主教及全体司铎李君武等二十三人，亦联名请求北京市人民政府接管仁慈堂。
