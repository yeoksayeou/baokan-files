To the Editors:

    The criticisms and suggestions made by Comrades Li Zhengguan, Yang Detian, and Wang Xingren in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on October 7th regarding our office's subscription and distribution work are correct, and we sincerely accept them. The occurrence of these errors is primarily due to the fact that some of our colleagues have not yet truly regarded the book and periodical distribution work as a serious political task in their thinking; secondly, our work lacks a strict and complete system, and when errors occur, we cannot immediately find the problem. For example, regarding the three duplicate issues of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy," after checking the address labels, no error was found, but in fact, the repetition was caused by delayed supplementary distribution. Furthermore, the address label for "New Observer" stated Volume 2, Issue 12, but Volume 2, Issue 10 was mistakenly sent during packaging. This seriously illustrates the careless work style that exists in our work. We did not humbly accept the opinions raised by readers. For example, in our reply to Comrade Wang Xingren, we simply emphasized objective conditions and did not try to overcome them subjectively. Our irresponsible work style not only affected readers' learning but also fully demonstrated that we did not have a sufficient understanding of the fact that "readers' opinions are a powerful weapon for improving our distribution work."

    Our decided improvement measures for the future are: (1) Thoroughly correct the tendency to neglect politics; (2) Implement the execution of the improved work plan, transferring the label pasting work to the Warehouse Section to professionalize the work and clarify responsibilities; (3) Conduct a review based on the June improvement plan; (4) Contact the post office at least twice a month to understand the delivery situation, in order to discuss improvements together. In short, we must eliminate errors.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    新华书店总店对于发行工作中的错误的检讨
    编辑同志：十月七日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的李正冠、杨德田、王兴仁三同志对我处订阅发行工作的批评和建议都是正确的，我们诚恳接受。这些错误的发生，主要是由于我们有些工作同志，在思想上还没有真正把书刊发行工作看做是一个严肃的政治任务；其次是由于我们的工作还缺乏严密完整的制度，出了错误，也不能马上找出毛病。如“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”发重三期，根据现有贴头检查，并未发现错误，但事实上却因延期补发造成了重复。又如“新观察”的贴头上写着二卷十二期，包装时却错发了二卷十期。这严重地说明了我们工作中存在着粗枝大叶的作风。我们对读者所提的意见没有虚心接受，如对王兴仁同志的复信，单纯强调客观条件，没有从主观上去设法克服。我们的不负责任的工作作风，不但影响了读者学习，并充分地表现了我们对“读者意见是改善我们发行工作的有力武器”一点没有足够的认识。
    我们决定的今后改进办法是：（一）彻底纠正忽视政治的倾向；（二）贯彻改进工作方案的执行，将剪贴工作划归栈务科，使工作专业，职责明确；（三）根据六月改进方案进行一次复查；（四）每月至少向邮局了解寄递情况两次，以共商改进。总之我们一定要把错误消灭。
