    Movies and Literary Works Should Reflect Reality in a Timely Manner
    To the Editor: I am a worker at the Xinhua Printing Factory in Beijing. For more than two years, we have made considerable progress under the education of the Communist Party. However, I see that some movies and literary works reflecting the lives of workers still focus on depicting how backward workers transform. We don't particularly like this old-fashioned way of writing. For example, when some movies and literary works depict activists preparing to create new records, they often focus on depicting how backward elements, fearing their jobs will be threatened, strike at the activists. I feel that this no longer conforms to the ideological situation of most workers today. In our factory, Comrade Lin Wenhou, after painstaking research, improved the manual book-sawing tool; Comrade Li Chunyang invented the three-knife cutting method; Comrade Zhuang Fulu invented the cardboard method for cutting books. All the workers in the factory were inspired by these inventions. Everyone congratulated them, and not a single worker was dissatisfied with them, and no one had the idea of being afraid of losing their jobs. Therefore, I hope that literary and art workers will go to the factories more often to understand the lives of the workers. Only in this way can good works reflecting the lives of workers be produced.
    Worker, Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory, Wang Haipeng

    电影和文学作品要及时反映现实
    编辑同志：我是北京新华印刷厂的工人。两年多以来，我们在共产党的教育下，有不小的进步。可是，我看见有些反映工人生活的电影和文艺作品，还是着重描写落后工人怎样转变。这种老一套的写法，我们不十分爱看。如有些电影和文学作品在描写积极分子准备创造新纪录的时候，常常着重地描写落后分子怕自己的饭碗打破，就打击那个积极分子。我觉得这已经不合乎今天一般工人的思想情况了。像我们工厂里的林文厚同志经过苦心钻研，改进了手工锯书工具；李纯阳同志发明了三刀断裁法；庄福禄同志发明了裁本垫纸板的方法，全厂工人都被这些发明所鼓舞。大家都祝贺他们，找不出一个工人对他们不满的，更没有人产生害怕打破自己饭碗的想法。因此，我希望文艺工作者多多下工厂，了解工人生活，只有这样，才能产生反映工人生活的好作品。北京新华印刷一厂工人　王海鹏
