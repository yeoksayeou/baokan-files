    Thoroughly Reform the Feudal System of Fecal Matter Ownership
    Beijing Arrests Heinous Fecal Matter Overlords and Despots
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau and Sanitation Engineering Bureau issued a proclamation on the 3rd regarding the reform of the feudal fecal matter system. On the evening of the 3rd, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested twenty-two fecal matter overlords and despots, including the most heinous criminal, Yu Deshun.
    The fecal matter system in Beijing is a type of feudal ownership system. Fecal matter owners occupy fecal matter routes and toilets, independently buying, selling, leasing, transferring, or employing workers to operate them. Fecal matter carts travel and park on the streets all day long, with fecal matter yards and pits set up everywhere, harming public health. During the season when rural areas need fertilizer, they manipulate and raise fecal matter prices to seek exorbitant profits and adulterate the fecal matter with fake materials, seriously damaging agricultural production. Some fecal matter owners colluded with the Japanese puppets and Kuomintang reactionary forces in the past, cruelly oppressing and exploiting workers, even driving workers to death and burying them alive, bullying small and medium-sized fecal matter merchants and the broad masses of citizens, dominating the entire city, and becoming fecal matter overlords and despots.
    Before liberation, fecal matter workers lived inhuman lives. In addition to scooping and transporting fecal matter and sun-drying it, some workers had to carry water and perform other hard labor for the fecal matter owners, working from morning till night, but receiving very low wages. Some fecal matter despots did not pay their workers at all. For example, worker Zhang Ningyi scooped fecal matter for fecal matter despot Miao Lansheng for thirty years, and Zhang Hongshun scooped fecal matter for fecal matter despot Liu Dianzhi for twenty-one years, without receiving any wages. Due to difficult living conditions, workers were forced to ask residents for monthly and festival money. Capitalists could dismiss workers at will, but workers had nowhere to go. Workers could not rest at any time of the year except for the first day of the Lunar New Year. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, big fecal matter overlords and despots like Yu Deshun took away the workers'
    "identity cards," and workers would be fired for the slightest carelessness. They also colluded with enemy and puppet military police to send workers to the Northeast as laborers.
    Every worker who worked under the fecal matter despot Liu Chunjiang had been beaten and scolded by him. When worker Zhang Lianbang broke his leg while driving a cart, fecal matter despot Miao Lansheng not only did not treat him, but he was buried alive before he died. Fecal matter despot Widow Qu did not pay worker Sun Qian his wages and beat him up instead. Sun Qian was driven to a dead end and hanged himself in Widow Qu's courtyard. After liberation, the fecal matter despots continued to oppress and cruelly exploit the workers, arbitrarily violating the collective labor-capital contract, lowering wages, and owing workers wages amounting to as much as two thousand catties of corn. Although the phenomenon of fecal matter despots beating and abusing workers has slightly decreased, it still continues to exist.
    Most of the general fecal matter merchants and independent laborers in the fecal matter industry rent fecal matter routes from the big fecal matter overlords, and the fecal matter they scoop out is forced to be sold to the fecal matter overlords and despots. Some of the fecal matter routes they occupied were seized by the fecal matter overlords and despots.
    Fecal matter overlords and despots not only reigned supreme in the fecal matter industry but were also overbearing and domineering among the people of the city. The big fecal matter despot Yu Deshun, who colluded with the Kuomintang and Japanese puppet reactionary ruling forces in the past, had been entrenched as the director of the puppet fecal matter office and the chairman of the "Fecal Matter Carrier Occupational Union." He colluded with fecal matter despot and secret agent Jin Renfu (nicknamed "Seventh Master Jin") and hired the big rogue Zhao Yousan (nicknamed "Fourth Emperor Zhao") as his assistant, employing lawyers and raising thugs to bully fecal matter workers and small and medium-sized fecal matter merchants, dominating the entire city. In 1948, Yu Deshun, Jin Renfu, and others organized thugs to block the student teams from Tsinghua University and Yenching University who were participating in patriotic parades outside Xizhimen. Some fecal matter overlords and despots even seized other people's wives, raped women, and committed all kinds of evil. For example, fecal matter despot Nie Yonglu forced his sister-in-law to death and raped three women; fecal matter despot Zhao Delu even raped his own daughter.
    After the liberation of Beijing, these fecal matter overlords and despots showed no repentance. In October 1950, fecal matter despots Yang Cunzhi, Ming Chuanyou, and others gathered together to oppose the People's Government's recovery and reconstruction of public toilets, resisted the management of public toilets by the Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau, forcibly rented them, and clamored that they had held three meetings overnight, organized ten thousand people to prepare to petition the People's Government, plotting to disrupt social order.
    In addition, there is also a group of "sea runners" who do not have their own fecal matter routes and specialize in stealing fecal matter. They engage in an illegitimate occupation. The ringleaders among them also open "pot gangs," using various feudal guild methods to deceive and win over general "sea runners," specializing in fighting and causing disturbances to social order. Since the liberation of Beijing, "sea runner" ringleaders such as Zong Yaoming have gathered crowds to cause trouble three times and incited bad elements among the "sea runners" to say that "the law does not punish the masses," and "we are responsible for causing trouble."
    Since the liberation of Beijing, fecal matter workers, suburban farmers, and the broad masses of the people have continuously demanded severe punishment for the fecal matter overlords and despots. The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conferences have repeatedly proposed reforms to the feudal fecal matter system. After a long period of investigation and research, the Municipal People's Government arrested these fecal matter overlords and despots on November 3rd; at the same time, the Public Security Bureau and the Sanitation Engineering Bureau issued a proclamation on the reform of the feudal fecal matter system, abolishing the feudal fecal matter ownership system, with all fecal matter routes and toilets being managed by the government. Independent laborers and general fecal matter merchants, as long as they strictly abide by government laws and regulations, ensure the cleanliness of residents' toilets, and register with the government on time, the government will still allow them to continue operating fecal matter routes. In this way, the feudal fecal matter ownership system has been completely abolished, removing the stone pressing on the heads of fecal matter workers, enabling the city's fecal matter management work to gradually move onto the normal path under the unified leadership of the People's Government, laying a good foundation for improving urban public health in the future.

### 彻底改革封建的粪道占有制度  北京市逮捕罪大恶极的粪阀恶霸

    彻底改革封建的粪道占有制度
    北京市逮捕罪大恶极的粪阀恶霸
    北京市人民政府公安局和卫生工程局于三日发布关于改革封建粪道制度的布告，三日晚北京市公安局将罪大恶极的粪阀恶霸于德顺等二十二人逮捕。
    北京市的粪道制度，是一种封建的占有制度。粪道主占有粪道、厕所，自行买卖、租赁、转让或雇工经营。粪车整天在街上来往存放，到处设置粪场、粪坑，妨害公共卫生。在农村需要用粪的季节，他们就操纵与高抬粪价，谋取暴利；并在粪干中掺假，严重地损害农业生产。有些粪道主，过去勾结日伪和国民党反动势力，极残酷地压迫剥削工人，甚至逼死、活埋工人，欺压中小粪商和广大市民，称霸全市，成为粪阀恶霸。
    在解放前，粪业工人过着非人的生活。工人除掏粪、拉粪车、晒粪之外，有的还要给粪道主担水服役，作其他苦工，从早忙到晚，所得的工资却很低。有的粪霸根本不给工人工资。如工人张宁一，给粪霸苗兰生掏粪三十年，张洪顺给粪霸刘殿芝掏粪二十一年，都没有得到过工资。工人因生活困难，被迫向住户索取月钱、节钱。资方可以随便解雇工人，工人却无路可走。工人一年中，除阴历正月初一休息一天以外，其他时间都不能休息。在日寇和国民党统治时期，大粪阀恶霸于德顺等把工人的
    “身份证”收起来，工人略一不慎就被开除。他们还勾结敌伪宪兵、警察把工人送往东北当劳工。
    在粪阀恶霸刘春江手下作过活的工人，没有一个没挨过他的打骂的。工人张连邦赶车时把腿摔伤，粪霸苗兰生不但不给他医治，人还没死，就被活埋了。粪霸曲寡妇，不给工人孙谦工资，反而毒打了孙谦一顿，孙谦被逼得走头无路，就吊死在曲寡妇的院中。解放之后，粪霸们仍继续压迫和残酷地剥削工人，擅自违反劳资集体合同，压低工资，有拖欠工人工资多至二千斤玉米的。粪霸们打骂虐待工人的现象虽然稍有减少，但仍继续存在。
    一般粪商和粪业中的独立劳动者，多从大粪阀手中租用粪道，掏出来的粪被迫卖给粪阀恶霸。他们所占有的粪道有些被粪阀恶霸占了。
    粪阀恶霸不仅在粪业中称王称霸，在全市人民中也是横行霸道。大粪霸于德顺，过去勾结国民党和日伪反动统治势力，一直盘据着伪粪便事务所主任和“粪夫职业工会”会长的职务，与粪霸特务分子金仁甫（绰号“金七爷”）勾结，并以大流氓赵佑三（绰号“赵四皇上”）为助手，雇用律师，豢养打手，欺压粪业工人及中小粪商，称霸全市。一九四八年，于德顺、金仁甫等曾组织打手到西直门外去阻击清华大学、燕京大学参加爱国游行的学生队伍。有些粪阀恶霸甚至霸占别人的妻子，强奸妇女，无恶不作。如粪霸聂永禄曾逼死弟妇，强奸妇女三人；粪霸赵德禄竟强奸其亲生女儿。
    北京解放之后，这些粪阀恶霸毫不悔改。在一九五○年十月，粪霸杨存治、明传有等聚伙反对人民政府收回与改建公共厕所，抗拒市人民政府卫生工程局管理公厕，竟强行租用，并扬言一夜开了三个会，组织了一万人准备向人民政府请愿，阴谋扰乱社会治安。
    此外，还有一部分自己没有粪道，专门偷掏粪便的“跑海的”。他们是从事一种不正当的职业。其中的恶霸头子还开设“锅伙”，以各种封建行会手段欺骗和拉拢一般“跑海的”，专事打架斗殴，扰乱社会治安。跑海的恶霸头子宗耀明等，在北京解放以来，曾三次聚伙捣乱，并煽动“跑海”中的坏分子说“法不压众”，“闹出乱子我们负责”。
    北京解放以来，粪业工人、郊区农民和全市广大人民，不断要求严惩粪阀恶霸。北京市历次各界人民代表会议，都有要求改革封建粪道制度的提案，市人民政府经过长期的调查研究，乃于十一月三日逮捕了这些粪阀恶霸；同时公安局和卫生工程局发布关于改革封建粪道制度的布告，废除封建的粪道占有制度，一切粪道厕所由政府管理，独立劳动者及一般粪商，只要他们严格遵守政府法令、保证居民厕所清洁、按期向政府登记，政府仍允许其继续经营粪道。这样就彻底废除了封建的粪道占有制度，搬掉了压在粪业工人头上的石头，使本市的粪便管理工作得以在人民政府的统一领导下逐渐走上正常的道路，为改进今后城市公共卫生打下了良好的基础。    （贾晓）
