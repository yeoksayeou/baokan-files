	In June 1950, the First National Higher Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government clearly defined the principles and tasks of higher education in New China. In terms of consolidating and transforming higher education to meet the needs of national construction, a series of decisions were announced and many effective measures were taken, laying the foundation for reforming the old higher education system. At the same time, it pointed out the importance of institutional mergers and departmental adjustments in the process of higher education reform.

	Beiyang University, with a history of 56 years, and Hebei Institute of Technology, with a history of 48 years, had favorable conditions for merging due to their close proximity, similar departmental setups, and close relationships. After more than a year of full deliberation, our two schools, based on the spirit of the National Higher Education Conference, put forward a request for merger and reform. With the approval of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, representatives from the administration, labor union, and student union of the two schools discussed under the leadership of the Ministry of Education in early May this year, and decided to form a school merger preparatory committee to specifically lead the merger work.

	After the school merger preparatory committee was formed, we felt the need to place the merger work on a broader basis and absorb representatives from all aspects to participate together. Therefore, we established four specialized committees: 1. Compilation Committee: tasked with drafting plans for the university's staffing, personnel allocation, salary adjustments, and dormitory adjustments. 2. Department and Section Allocation Committee: drafting plans for department and section adjustments, equipment adjustments, and adjustments of factory buildings, laboratories, and classrooms. 3. Planning Committee: drafting plans for this year's enrollment and equipment procurement, departmental and section setup plans, teaching plans, and development plans. 4. School Property Inventory Committee: drafting a plan for inventorying and unifying methods, and being responsible for supervising the inventory.

	Each specialized committee was led separately by the preparatory committee and participated in by committee members. The administrative heads of the two schools participated in the first three committees, which had relatively heavy tasks. It should be explained here that Beiyang University originally had eleven departments, and Hebei Institute of Technology had five departments: Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Water Conservancy, and Textile Engineering, all of which were duplicated by Beiyang. After the merger of the two schools, because neither campus was large enough to accommodate all students, they had to be temporarily separated into two locations. Which department should be located where, how teaching equipment should be adjusted and moved, how faculty and staff housing, factory buildings, and laboratories should be allocated, all needed to be planned in detail, hence the establishment of the Allocation Committee.

	The draft plans prepared by each specialized committee were printed and distributed to each labor union group, student union, and class for research and discussion, allowing them to offer opinions. The specialized committee would make necessary revisions, and then re-distribute them to groups, classes, and the student union for discussion. In the first month, members of the labor union and student union did not pay much attention to the merger work. Many groups and class meetings set aside the draft plans and did not conduct discussions, which delayed the merger work. Later, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education, personally went to Tianjin to explain the significance and importance of the merger to all teachers, students, and staff of the two schools, and held a forum with the teachers to dispel some ideological concerns. The Preparatory Committee also reported various draft plans to the teachers, students, and staff of the two schools. After this mobilization, the masses launched a heated discussion on the merger work and put forward suggestions. In this way, the merger work was smoothly promoted. Therefore, letting all teachers, students, and staff know from the beginning that the merger was an important and serious task that required everyone's joint efforts, adopting the mass line, and using democratic centralism, was one of the reasons for the success of our merger work. The draft plans of each specialized committee, after the above-mentioned multiple discussions, were finally revised and approved by the Preparatory Committee, and a merger plan was created and submitted to the Ministry of Education, which was reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education.

	The other difficulties we encountered in the merger work were roughly as follows:

	First, the issue of the school name. The reason why this became an issue was that sectarianism was at play. After the political awareness of teachers and students improved, this issue was resolved.

	Second, the issue of the survival of the "院" (college/faculty). Beiyang University was originally divided into the College of Engineering and the College of Science. There was a "院" level in the administrative organization, but the "院" did not exist in the Provisional Regulations for Institutions of Higher Education promulgated by the Ministry of Education. During the merger preparations, there were some debates about the survival of the "院", and finally the Ministry of Education approved that no "院" should be established.

	Third, the issue of grouping. How many groups should be set up for each department was decided on the principle of concentrating strength and developing key areas, temporarily adopting the principle of not exceeding three groups.

	Fourth, the issue of department and section allocation (i.e., which department should be located where). Because Tianjin University was gradually concentrating on the old Beiyang University campus, everyone wanted to concentrate on the new campus first; but due to housing limitations, it was temporarily impossible. In the end, the problem was solved based on the principle of minimizing equipment movement.

	Fifth, the issue of personnel allocation. Originally, each administrative unit of the two schools had its own负责人 (heads/persons in charge). After the merger, it was necessary to re-appoint them. When solving this problem, we used qualifications, work ability, and work attitude as the standards for measuring and approving. For administrative units with heavy workloads or that must be set up in two locations, deputy positions were set up after consideration. When reorganizing the staff, individual wishes were first investigated in advance, and their wishes were taken into account as much as possible during the reorganization. In doing this work, we generally did not encounter difficulties.

	Sixth, the issue of course sharing. A certain professor originally taught a certain course at a certain school. After the merger, changes were inevitable. How to arrange courses was a very delicate task. In this regard, we encountered some difficulties, but finally overcame them. The method used was: to reduce the number of subjects taught by each person as much as possible and increase the teaching time for the same subject. This can make teachers more specialized and have more preparation time, which is beneficial for improving teaching content and in-depth research.

	Thus, after more than five months of preparation, a new, people's, comprehensive industrial university—Tianjin University—was officially established.

	Originally, the conditions for the merger of the two schools had long been in place, but why did it take two years after liberation for the two schools to merge? Why couldn't the merger be carried out immediately when it was proposed a year ago? This exposed a serious problem, which was the ideological remoulding of various intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. Admittedly, the victory of our merger was also the victory of the political study and ideological remoulding of all our teachers, students, and staff in the two years since liberation. However, we so-called senior intellectuals have not seriously and well conducted our own ideological remoulding in the past two years, so when we come into contact with practical problems, especially the reform of higher education and the issue of ideological remoulding, we completely expose all kinds of ideological shortcomings. The process of our merger work fully proves this point: the root of all problems is ideological problems. If our thinking had been cleared, then our merger work could have started a year ago. More than a year of deliberation was a long process of ideological struggle. In the preparation work, the successful completion of each task was mainly due to the consensus of ideological understanding; the reason why each task encountered difficulties was also because ideological problems were at work there. We correctly realized that the merger of universities, the adjustment of departments, and the reform of courses are completely determined by our ideological remoulding. Without a correct ideological foundation, even with sufficient objective conditions, no task can be successfully completed. As Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education, pointed out: "The ideological remoulding of teachers in institutions of higher education is the key to the reform of higher education." Through this study movement of teachers in institutions of higher education, we believe that the reform of higher education will be able to move forward more smoothly. Only in this way can we avoid certain errors and shortcomings and better complete this great and arduous task.

　　北洋大学和河北工学院是怎样合并的？
    天津大学校务委员会副　主　席  赵今声
    一九五○年六月间，中央人民政府教育部召开的第一次全国高等教育会议，明确规定了新中国高等教育的方针与任务。在整顿和改造高等教育以适应国家建设需要方面，公布了一系列的决定，采取了许多有效的措施，奠定了改革旧有高等教育的基础。同时指出院校合并、院系调整在高等教育改革过程中的重要性。
    有着五十六年历史的北洋大学和有着四十八年历史的河北工学院，由于校址距离很近，系组设置相同，来往关系密切，提供了两校合并的有利条件。经过一年多的充分酝酿，我们两校就依据全国高等教育会议的精神，提出了合并改革的要求，经中央人民政府教育部同意，于今年五月初，两校行政、工会、学生会等代表在教育部领导下进行商讨，确定组成并校筹备委员会，具体领导并校工作。
    并校筹备委员会组成后，我们感觉需要把并校工作放在更广泛的基础上，吸收各方面的代表人物来共同参加，于是就另外成立了四个专门委员会：一、编制委员会：任务是草拟大学的编制、人事的调配、工资的调整、宿舍的调整等方案。二、系科组调配委员会：草拟系科组的调整、设备的调整、厂房实验室教室的调整等方案。三、计划委员会：草拟本年度招生及设备购置计划、系科组的设置计划、教学计划、发展计划等方案。四、校产清理委员会：草拟清点统一办法方案，并负责督导清点。
    每一个专门委员会都由筹备委员会分别领导，并由委员参加。前三个任务比较繁重的委员会，两校行政负责人均参加。在这里须要加以解释的是：北洋大学原来有十一个学系，河北工学院有化工、机械、电机、水利、纺织五个学系，都是和北洋重复的。两校合并以后，因为任何一处校舍都不大，无法容纳全部学生，故暂时仍须分在二处。何系设何处，教学设备如何调整搬迁，教职员工住房，厂房实验室等如何调配，均须一一加以计划，故有调配委员会的设置。
    各个专门委员会所拟定的计划草案均印发工会各小组、学生会和各班研究讨论，让他们提出意见。由专门委员会作必要修正后，再发给小组、班和学生会讨论。最初一个月，工会、学生会会员对并校工作不甚注意，许多小组、班会把草案搁置起来，不进行讨论。因而使并校工作拖延下去了。后来中央人民政府教育部曾昭抡副部长亲自到天津向两校全体师生员工说明并校的意义和重要性，并与两校教师开了座谈会，解除了一些思想上的顾虑。筹委会也把各种计划草案向两校师生员工报告。经过这次动员以后，群众对并校工作展开热烈讨论，并提出了建议。这样，并校工作才顺利地推动起来。所以从一开始就让全体师生员工明了并校是一件重要而严肃的工作，需要大家共同来搞，这种走群众路线，采用民主集中制的作法，是我们并校工作成功的原因之一。各专门委员会的计划草案，经过上述的多次讨论，最后由筹备委员会修正通过，制成了并校计划，呈送教育部，经教育部审核批准。
    我们在并校工作中所遇到的另外一些困难，大致有以下几点：
    第一、校名问题。这个问题所以成为问题，还是宗派思想在作祟。在教师和学生的政治认识都提高以后，这个问题是解决了。
    第二、院的存废问题。北洋大学原分为工学院及理学院，在行政组织上有院一级，但在教育部所颁高等学校暂行规程中，院是不存在的。在并校筹备中，对于院的存废曾有过一些争论，最后由教育部核定不设院。
    第三、分组问题。每一学系分设多少组，在集中力量和重点发展的原则下，决定暂以不超过三组为原则。
    第四、系科组调配问题（就是何系设在何处的问题）。因为天津大学是逐渐向旧北洋大学校址集中发展，所以大家都想先集中在新校址；但因房屋限制暂时又办不到。最后还是本着设备最少搬动的原则，来解决了这个问题。
    第五、人事调配问题。原来两校各行政单位各有负责人，并校以后，必须重新聘定。解决这个问题时，我们是以资望、工作能力、工作态度作为衡量审定的标准。工作繁重或必须分设两处的行政单位，斟酌设置副职。职员重新编组时，事前先调查了个人志愿，在编组时尽量照顾其志愿。在做这件工作时，大体未遇到困难。
    第六、课程分担问题。某位教授在某校原来担任某课程，并校以后，难免有所更动，如何安排课程，是一个非常细致的工作。在这方面，我们曾遇到一些困难，但最后终于克服了。所用的方法是：尽量使每人所担任的课目减少，增加同一课目的授课时间。这样可以使教师更为专业化，更有充分的准备时间，这对于改进教学内容及深入研究是有利的。
    这样，经过五个多月的筹备，一个新的、人民的、综合性的工业大学——天津大学正式成立了。
    本来，两校合并的条件，是早就具备了的，但为什么两校在解放后两年才能合并？为什么在一年前提出合并的时候不能立即合并？这就暴露了一个严重的问题，这个问题，就是各种知识分子，特别是高级知识分子的思想改造问题。诚然，我们并校的胜利，也就是我们全体师生员工解放后两年来政治学习、思想改造的胜利。但是，我们这些所谓高级知识分子两年来并没有认真地很好地进行自己的思想改造，因而一接触到实际问题，尤其是改革高等教育和思想改造问题，就完全暴露出思想上各式各样的缺点。我们并校工作的过程完全证明了这一点：一切问题的根源都是思想问题。假设我们的思想都已搞通了的话，那么我们的并校工作在一年前就可以开始了。一年多的酝酿时间，是一个漫长的思想斗争过程。在筹备工作当中，每一工作的顺利完成，主要的都是由于思想认识的一致；每一工作所以遭遇困难，也就是思想问题在那里作祟。我们正确地认识到：院校合并、院系调整、课程改革，完全决定于我们的思想改造。没有正确的思想基础，即使有着充分的客观条件，也不会胜利地完成任何任务。正如中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长所指出的：“高等学校教师的思想改造，是高等教育改革的关键。”通过这次高等学校教师的学习运动，我们相信高等教育的改革工作必能更顺利地向前推进。也惟有这样，才能避免若干错误和缺点，更好地完成这一伟大艰巨的任务。
