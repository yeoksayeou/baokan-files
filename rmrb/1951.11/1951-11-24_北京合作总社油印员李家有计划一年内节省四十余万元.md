    To the Editor:

    I am a mimeograph operator at the Beijing Cooperative General Office. I firmly support the call for increased production and conservation. In the past, when we burned the used mimeograph stencils, a lot of ink was burned in the raging fire, and I felt this was wasteful. Later, when I removed the stencils, I clipped the edges of the stencils and scraped off the ink with a knife. Calculating this way, I can save about one box of ink per month. Therefore, I now plan to save at least one box of ink each month, guaranteeing a saving of twelve boxes per year. Calculating each box at 35,000 yuan, a total of 420,000 yuan can be saved. Another benefit of scraping off the ink is that it is easier to peel off when reprinting and it is also easier to store. In addition, in the past when we cut paper, we felt that the paper scraps we cut off were very little, so we burned or threw them away. Later, I calculated that we throw away at least two jin per month, and 24 jin per year. If each jin is calculated at 2,000 yuan, we waste 48,000 yuan per year. Now I have planned to save 24 jin of paper scraps every year, and together with the saved ink, I can save a total of 468,000 yuan per year. I think that although this number is not large, if all the mimeograph operators in the country can do this, it will save the country a great deal of wealth.　Li Jiayou

    北京合作总社油印员李家有计划一年内节省四十余万元
    编辑同志：我是北京合作总社的油印员。我对增产节约的号召表示坚决拥护。过去，我们将印完了的腊纸烧销时，熊熊的火中有许多油墨被烧掉，我觉得这是浪费。后来，我卸腊纸版时把腊纸边夹起来，用小刀将油墨刮干净，这样计算一下，每月大约可以积下一盒油墨。因此，我现在计划：每个月最低要省一盒油墨，保证一年节省十二盒。每盒按三万五千元计算，共可节省四十二万元。刮下油墨的另一好处是补印时也容易揭开；还便于保存。另外，我们过去裁纸的时候，裁下的纸边觉得很少，因此就把它烧掉或扔掉了。后来我一算，每月最低扔掉有二斤，一年就扔掉二十四斤；每斤如按二千元计算，一年就要浪费四万八千元。现在我已计划每年节省纸边二十四斤，连同节省的油墨，一年共可节约四十六万八千元。我想，这个数字虽然不大，但全国的油印员要都能这样，就将给国家节省很大一笔财富。　李家有
