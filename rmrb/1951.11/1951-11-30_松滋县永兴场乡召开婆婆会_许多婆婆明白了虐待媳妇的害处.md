Yongxingchang Township, Songzi County, Holds Mother-in-Law Meeting
Many Mothers-in-Law Understand the Harm of Mistreating Daughters-in-Law

In late August, Yongxingchang Township in Songzi County, Hubei Province, convened a mother-in-law meeting to promote the Marriage Law and educate against the mistreatment of daughters-in-law, with significant results. Many mothers-in-law in the township mistreated their daughters-in-law, leading to frequent quarrels and fights within many families. The township head and women's representatives considered this phenomenon to be a widespread and serious problem, and therefore convened a meeting of ninety-four mothers-in-law on August 27th. At the beginning of the informal discussion, many mothers-in-law mistakenly thought: "Now it's a crime to be a mother-in-law, that's why they're calling us to a meeting." Later, the cadres explained the Marriage Law to them, explained the benefits of a democratic and harmonious new family, and pointed out that mistreating and beating daughters-in-law was wrong and illegal. After discussion, most of the mothers-in-law present understood the reasoning. Han Mingwen's mother-in-law said: "I was also a daughter-in-law, and I was beaten and scolded by my mother-in-law. At that time, I thought 'mothers-in-law should beat and scold their daughters-in-law.' After attending this meeting, I realized that was wrong. Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law should discuss how to manage the household well. 'When the whole family is harmonious, barren land can be turned into gold.' Only when everyone stops arguing can we improve production. I will never beat or scold my daughter-in-law again." The day after the meeting (August 29th), Huang Ziying's mother in the township sent her child bride to the Farmers' Association, unwilling to let her son marry the child bride. She said, "It's all the fault of this system (referring to the child bride marriage system) that prevailed in the past (feudal society). I was the one who did this before, and now I'm the one who's sending her out. She has been in my family for eight years. Now I'm giving her a set of Shilin cloth clothing and a dan of grain to let her return to her parents' home!" The child bride was very moved and said: "Thanks to Chairman Mao for coming up with such a Marriage Law, I was able to turn over a new leaf." (Reprinted from Hubei Daily)

    松滋县永兴场乡召开婆婆会
    许多婆婆明白了虐待媳妇的害处
    湖北省松滋县永兴场乡于八月下旬召开婆婆会，对婆婆们宣传婚姻法，进行反对虐待媳妇的教育，收效很大。该乡很多婆婆都虐待媳妇，以致很多家庭都经常争吵打骂。该乡乡长和妇女代表认为这种现象是具有普遍性的一个严重问题，乃于八月二十七日召集了九十四个婆婆开会。开始漫谈时，很多婆婆都错误地认为：“现在当婆婆的有罪啦，所以才找我们来开会。”后来干部向她们解释了婚姻法，并说明了民主和睦的新家庭的好处，指出虐待、打骂媳妇是不应该的，犯法的。经过讨论，多数到会的婆婆才把道理弄明白。韩明文的婆婆说：“我也当过媳妇，受过婆婆的打骂，当时认为‘当婆婆的就是应该打骂媳妇’。开了这个会，我才知道那是不对的，应该是婆媳商量着把家务搞好。‘全家和睦，黄土变成金’，大家不吵闹了，才能搞好生产。我今后再不打骂媳妇了。”会后的第二天（二十九日），该乡黄子英的妈妈就把她的童养媳送到了农民协会，不愿意叫她的儿子和童养媳结婚了。她说：“只怪过去（封建社会）兴的这板眼（指童养媳的婚姻制度）不好。先前是我做的事，现在还是我送她出来。她来我家八年了，如今我送她一身士林布衣料，谷一担，让她回娘家去吧！”童养媳妇很感动地说：“亏了毛主席想出这样的婚姻法，我才翻了身。”（转载湖北日报）
