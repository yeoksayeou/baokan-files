    My Experiences in the Catholic Reform Movement
    Wu Kezhai
    In the summer of last year, I already had the motivation to participate in the Catholic Reform Movement. However, at that time, I only had a vague concept, which was to save the Church. Tianjin had been liberated for over a year, and the country was progressing by leaps and bounds, but the Catholic Church remained isolated from society. The Common Program clearly stipulated that people have freedom of religious belief. Why should we Catholics abandon ourselves from the people? I felt that the Catholic Church should be reformed, but one thing was in my mind that I could not decide: would reform violate Church doctrine? After months of thinking and consulting several Catholic sacred books (mainly the Old and New Testaments), I finally realized that reform was to promote Catholicism widely and was in line with the spirit of Jesus. I individually discussed this issue with some priests, and they initially agreed with my view and encouraged me to launch this movement. However, after the French imperialist Vincent Lebbe learned of this news, he greatly obstructed and sabotaged it. He said, "The reform movement is a schism. Whoever participates in the reform will go to hell, and their sacraments will be suspended!" After the priests heard his rumors, they sided with him and dared not agree with the reform anymore. The imperialist elements even wanted to intimidate me by suspending my sacraments. Once, when I was going to perform my sacraments, an imperialist priest said to me, "Bishop Lebbe has ordered that you cannot perform your sacraments!" My thoughts were confused for a time: "Will reform send me to hell?" Regarding this question, I went to talk to a Chinese priest again, and we debated for over an hour. Finally, I said, "Jesus said, 'Man has no right to judge man (to ascend to heaven or descend to hell). If you judge people, you will be judged in the future.' Bishops and priests are all human beings, how can they judge that I will go to hell and suspend my sacraments?" The priest was speechless after I asked him this question.
    In actual struggle, we gradually realized that those who hinder the Catholic Reform are the imperialist elements who use Catholicism as a tool of aggression. On January 13th of this year, we published the Reform Manifesto and established the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association. Subsequently, the struggle became overt. Imperialist elements such as Vincent Lebbe and members of the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" spread rumors everywhere saying: the members of the Promotion Association are all devils, the reform movement is a schism, and Catholics who sign the Reform Manifesto will also go to hell. At this time, many Catholics were deceived by them and estranged themselves from the members of the Preparatory Committee of the Promotion Association. Therefore, our initial propaganda work was difficult to carry out. We posted big-character posters on the walls of various Catholic churches, and used loudspeakers to broadcast in front of the churches after Sunday Mass and benediction. Initially, very few people listened because the imperialist elements had already "warned" the Catholics that our propaganda was the "voice of the devil." However, later some curious Catholics occasionally stopped to listen, and after listening several times, they understood that reform was originally a movement to love the Church and oppose imperialism, not a schism. In this way, the number of listeners gradually increased, and many Catholics signed the Reform Manifesto. By April 7th, the number of signatures had reached 15,000. On this day, the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association was officially established.
    At this time, some progressive Catholics hoped to transform their thinking. The Promotion Association responded to this request and organized study groups. Three sessions have now been held. After studying, the Catholics generally recognized the crimes of the wolves in religious clothing who invaded China, and hated the imperialist elements even more. In May, after Vincent Lebbe's crimes of stealing and selling Church property and sabotaging the reform movement were exposed, the broad masses of Catholics rose up to demand the expulsion of Vincent Lebbe, and more than 400 Catholics went directly to Vincent Lebbe twice to reason with him and fight against him. Despite the fact that the imperialist elements lurking in the Tianjin diocese, such as Mansi and Wang Keming, organized "assassination squads," repeatedly sent threatening letters to the members of the Promotion Association, and prepared three sharp knives to commit violence, they were ultimately unable to stop the righteous struggle of the broad masses of Catholics.
    The Catholic Reform Movement in Tianjin has achieved a little success in this year, but there are still imperialist elements lurking in Tianjin Catholicism, and we must prevent their rumors and sabotage. At the same time, in order for Catholics to completely sever all ties with imperialism, there must be a very arduous process of ideological transformation. As far as I am personally concerned, in the continuous struggle against imperialist elements and their lackeys, my political awareness has been raised. From the initial simple desire to save the Church, I have gradually realized that loving the country and loving the Church are consistent and inseparable. Furthermore, I have also realized that the Pharisees are obstructing the reform movement in an attempt to continue using religion to invade China, which I hate deeply. However, when I fought against Vincent Lebbe, I committed sentimentalism and did not treat him as an enemy, which shows that I have not completely eliminated the malicious influence of imperialist elements in my thinking. Therefore, I believe that to do a good job in the reform movement, we must first stand firm, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and then we can wash away the stains that imperialist elements have added to Catholicism for many years, and thoroughly implement the autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese Catholic Church.

    我在天主教革新运动中的体会
    吴克斋
    在去年夏季，我就有参加天主教革新运动的动机了。不过当时只有一个模糊的概念，就是要救教。那时天津已经解放一年多，国家在飞跃地进步，可是天主教却始终与社会隔绝。共同纲领上明明规定人民有信仰宗教的自由，我们天主教为什么要自弃于人民呢？我感到天主教应该革新，不过有一事横于心中不能自决：革新是否违背教义？经过几个月的思索，又参阅了几本天主教的圣书（主要的是新旧经），终于认识到革新是广扬天主教，是合乎耶稣的精神的。我个别地和一些神甫谈过这个问题，他们起初也同意我的看法，并鼓励我去发动这一运动。但这一消息被法籍帝国主义分子文贵宾知道后，就大加阻挠破坏。他说：“革新运动就是裂教。谁参加革新，谁就下地狱，停止他们的神功！”神甫们听了他的谣言之后，就倒向他一边，不敢再赞成革新了。帝国主义分子还想以停止神功来恐吓我。有一次，我要去办神功时，一个帝国主义分子神甫对我说：“文主教有命令，你不能办神功！”我的思想曾一度混乱：“革新就要下地狱吗？”对此问题，我又找一位中国神甫去谈，辩论达一小时许，最后我说：“耶稣说，‘人没有判断人（升天堂下地狱）的权利，你要是判断人，你将来就是被判断者’。主教、神甫全是人，怎能判断我下地狱，停止我的神功呢？”这个神甫被我问得无话可说。
    在实际斗争中，我们逐渐认识到阻碍天主教革新的就是那些利用天主教作侵略工具的帝国主义分子。今年一月十三日，我们发表了革新宣言，并成立了天津市天主教革新运动促进会筹备会。随后，斗争也就表面化了。帝国主义分子文贵宾等和反动组织“圣母军”的人员到处造谣说：促进会的委员全是魔鬼，革新运动是裂教，教友在革新宣言上签名的也要下地狱。这时，许多教友受了他们的蒙蔽，对促进会筹备会的委员们全都疏远了。因此，我们初步的宣传工作很难展开。我们一面在各天主堂墙上贴出大字报，一面在主日（星期日）弥撒后、降福后，在各堂前用扩音器播音。最初听的人很少，因为帝国主义分子早已“警告”教友，说我们的宣传是“魔鬼之音”。可是，后来有些好奇的教友偶尔也驻足听听，听过几次之后，他们明白了革新原来是爱教反帝运动，并不是裂教。就这样，听的人日渐增多，很多教友在革新宣言上签了名，到四月七日，签名的已达一万五千人。就在这天，天津市天主教革新运动促进会正式成立了。
    这时，有些进步的教友，希望改造思想。促进会应此要求，举办了学习班。现在已经办了三期。经过学习的教友，一般认清了披着宗教外衣的豺狼们侵略中国的罪行，对帝国主义分子更加痛恨。五月间，当文贵宾盗卖教产、破坏革新运动等等罪行被揭发之后，广大教友起来要求驱逐文贵宾，并有四百多教友先后两次直接去和文贵宾作说理斗争。尽管这时潜伏在天津教区的帝国主义分子满济世、王克明等组织“暗杀团”，屡次发恫吓信给促进会的各委员，并备置三把尖刀准备行凶，但始终丝毫不能阻止广大教友的正义斗争。
    天津市的天主教革新运动，在这一年中获得了一点点成绩，但是，在天津天主教内，还潜藏着帝国主义分子，我们还要防止他们的造谣破坏；同时，在教友方面，要彻底与帝国主义割断一切联系，还得有一段很艰苦的思想改造过程。以我个人而论，在不断与帝国主义分子及其走狗的斗争中，政治觉悟提高了，由最初的单纯为了救教而渐渐地体会到爱国与爱教是一致的，是不能分开的，并且我也认识到法利赛党徒们阻挠革新运动，是妄图继续利用宗教侵略中国，这是我切齿痛恨的。可是在斗争文贵宾时，我犯了温情主义，没有用对待敌人的态度对待他，这说明了我在思想上还没有完全肃清帝国主义分子的恶毒影响。因此，我认为要搞好革新运动，首先必须站稳立场，分清敌我界线，然后才能洗刷帝国主义分子多年加给天主教的污点，彻底实行中国天主教的自治、自养和自传。
