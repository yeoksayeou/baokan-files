Reader's Letters:

The Commercial Press Published a Book, "Cooperative," Containing Errors

Editor:
    "Cooperative" (edited by Li Jixin), published by the Commercial Press in October 1950, is a book containing errors.

    First, regarding the nature of cooperatives. The provisions of Articles 29 and 38 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have already very clearly explained the characteristics of the New Democratic cooperative economy. However, the author of the book wrote on page seven: "A cooperative is an equal and mutual aid organization that jointly operates a business to seek its due benefits, is not exploited by others, and at the same time does not seek to exploit others for its own benefit. Using it can develop one's own business and improve one's life." In this way, the class nature of cooperatives, the economic status of cooperatives, the semi-socialist nature of cooperatives, and the supporting role of the People's Government for cooperatives are completely obliterated. Obviously, the author's explanation of the nature of cooperatives is a thorough and complete bourgeois viewpoint.

    Second, regarding the development direction of cooperatives, what the book says is also erroneous. On page ten of the book, it is written: "Now the farmers everywhere... it is better to merge everyone's fields together, eliminate the boundaries of the fields, and achieve whole pieces of land; using improved farm tools, or new-style mechanical large farm tools, to do it on a large scale, like the collective farms of the Soviet Union, or the large farms of the United States." We only need to look at his argument that the agricultural cooperatives of New China should develop "like... the large farms of the United States." Everyone knows that the "large farms" of the United States are built on the suffering of millions of displaced small farmers, and the Chinese people have long recognized that they are not worth considering. The author's statement is simply ignorant of the cooperative cause of New China.

    Third, regarding how to run cooperatives well. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the cooperatives of New China will only be run well and will not be run badly. The fact that the cooperative cause has developed rapidly in the past two years is ironclad proof. However, on page nine of the book, the author does not explain that the important guarantee for running cooperatives well is due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Instead, he puts forward empty terms such as the "determination," "efforts," and "hard work" of "farmers," and curses, saying, "If we do not have the determination... then we guarantee that there will be no hope of success in a hundred years!"

    We believe that it is a serious mistake that the publisher did not carefully review a book like this before publishing it. We hope that the Commercial Press will conduct a deep self-criticism.

### 商务印书馆出版的“合作社”是一本内容有错误的书

    商务印书馆出版的“合作社”是一本内容有错误的书
    编辑同志：商务印书馆一九五○年十月出版的“合作社”（李积新编著），是一本内容有错误的书。
    首先，关于合作社的性质问题。人民政协共同纲领第二十九条及第三十八条的规定，已经非常明确地说明了新民主主义合作社经济的特点。然而该书作者却在该书第七页中写道：“合作社，是一种大家平等的，互助的组织，来共同的经营一种事业，谋取自己应有的利益，不被别人所剥削，同时也是不谋取别人的利益而剥削别人的，用了他，可以发展自己的事业，改善自己的生活。”这样，就完全抹煞了合作社的阶级性、合作社的经济地位、合作社的半社会主义性质以及人民政府对合作社的扶助作用。显然，作者的这一对合作社性质的解释，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级观点。
    其次，关于合作社的发展方向问题，该书所说，也是有错误的。该书第十页中写道：“现在各地的农家，……不如将大家的田地，一齐合并起来，铲除了田垠的界限，成功了整片的地亩；利用改良的农具，或者是新式的机械大农具，来大规模的做一做，像苏联的集体农场，或是美国的大农场一样”。我们仅就他要新中国的农业合作社发展“像……美国的大农场一样”这一论点来看，谁都知道，美国的“大农场”是建立于千百万小农流离失所的苦痛之上的，中国人民早已认识到它的不值一顾。作者的这一说法，简直是对新中国合作事业的无知。
    再次，关于合作社如何才能办好的问题。新中国的合作社，在中国共产党和人民政府领导之下，是只会办好而不会办坏的。两年来合作事业之迅速发展的事实，就是一个铁证。然而该书作者却在该书第九页中，并未说明办好合作社的重要保证就是由于有着共产党和人民政府的正确领导，却提出什么“农家”的“决心”“努力”“实干”等空洞的名词，并咒骂地说什么“如若我们没有决心……那么保证一百年也不会有成功的希望”！
    我们认为，像这样的书，出版者竟未慎重地加以审查就予以出版，是一个严重的错误。希望商务印书馆进行深刻的检讨。
