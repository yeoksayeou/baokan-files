More than 10,000 construction workers and technicians in Beijing held a rally at the Labor People's Cultural Palace on the first of this month to accuse ten heinous feudal foremen, including Liu Qilin, in the construction industry. The Beijing Military Control Commission will interrogate these foremen separately and punish them according to law based on their crimes.

At the accusation meeting, Zhang Hongshun, vice chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech: The feudal foreman system is a major obstacle to the development of the construction industry and a stone pressing on the backs of construction workers. It must be thoroughly and completely crushed. He explained that it is necessary to resolutely oppose major foremen who have committed heinous crimes, are hated by the masses, and have engaged in serious exploitation and oppression, and to demand that the government punish them according to law. It is necessary to strive to reform medium and small foremen who have not committed serious crimes, to make them bow their heads and admit their mistakes to the workers, to contribute their skills, and to stand with the broad masses of workers to serve the cause of basic construction.

Worker Sun Guoliang was the first to take the stage to accuse the major foreman Liu Qilin of his crimes. He said: The major foreman Liu Qilin has done all kinds of evil, squeezing the workers until they can barely breathe. He does not allow workers to join the trade union, spreading rumors that the trade union is a "tax bureau." He slanders our "Resist America, Aid Korea" campaign, saying that the government wants workers to donate money. Workers who slightly resist Liu Qilin's oppression are immediately fired by him. Once, he fired two hundred workers. Sun Guoliang tearfully accused the foreman of beating and scolding his fellow workers. He listed the facts that Liu Qilin only wanted to make money, cut corners, and sabotaged national construction. He demanded that the government severely punish the heinous major foremen and completely eliminate the feudal foreman system. Worker Wen Liangong accused the major foreman Xu Zhisen of forcibly occupying workers' wives, and the foreman's henchman Tong Junxiang of committing sodomy with young workers. In the past, workers did not dare to mention these bestial acts, but today the workers have finally vented their grievances. Wen Liangong continued to accuse: In addition to ruthlessly exploiting workers by deducting wages and extending working hours, the major foremen, including Liu Qilin, also stole construction materials and falsely reported "black labor." Last year, in three projects, Liu Qilin embezzled a total of 670 million yuan. The major foreman Yu Fugui is a hereditary feudal foreman. He is in charge of larger earthwork projects. He has two wives, three accounting clerks, and a secretary, and cruelly oppresses and exploits workers, eating and drinking lavishly all day long. When worker Xiao Bingguang accused him, he asked, "Where did their money come from?" The workers answered in unison, "Exploiting us workers!" He asked, "Should we settle accounts?" The workers answered in unison, "Yes, settle accounts!" Immediately afterwards, the masses offstage kept shouting slogans such as "Eliminate the foreman system!" The major foreman Zhi Zhenbin is also a major tyrant and a major traitor. Worker Wu Gengye and others accused him of being the "Deputy Commander of the Communist Suppression and National Construction Army" during the Japanese occupation, persecuting the people, abducting and selling women, and doing everything evil. After liberation, he sneaked into a military organization to manage construction projects and colluded with private merchants to embezzle money by "selling the bottom line for bidding." The major foreman Zhang Shihan this year recklessly contracted projects everywhere. Before the workers' sheds were even built, he absconded with the wages.

At the end of the accusation, Wang Feiran, director of the Military Law Office of the Beijing Military Control Commission, spoke. He said: The Military Law Office, based on the accusations of the conference, accepts everyone's demands and will immediately step up the investigation and deal with it according to law. (The whole audience shouted: "Firmly support the People's Government!") Wang Mingzhi, director of the Municipal Construction Bureau, and Ma Guangdou, deputy director of the Municipal Labor Bureau, spoke at the meeting and unanimously expressed their firm support for the workers' demand to oppose the feudal foreman system. During the free speech session, worker representative Wang Dachuan said: "The Communist Party and the trade union have led us to overthrow the feudal foremen. We will definitely guarantee to increase production and not waste materials, and repay Chairman Mao's concern for us with practical actions." Engineer Gu Chuanxun said: "Today, we have moved away the big stone pressing on our heads and seen the blue sky. I deeply realize that to do a good job in construction projects, we must unite with the workers, fight down the feudal foremen! Expose those feudal foremen who are still hidden!" Liu Yuanjing, chairman of the Beijing Construction Industry Guild, said: "The feudal foremen are like a wall, separating labor and management. On the one hand, they exploit and extort workers in the name of the factory, and on the other hand, they deceive workers and extort the factory. Now that labor and management are closely united, we will definitely be able to completely destroy the feudal foreman system." Wang Ting, deputy manager of the state-owned Longhua Construction Company, said: "The company's administration will definitely support the workers and fight down the feudal foremen!" The meeting ended at 5 p.m. When the meeting adjourned, the whole audience shouted "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    北京市建筑业工人和技术人员一万多人，本月一日在劳动人民文化宫举行大会，控诉建筑业中刘启麟等十名罪大恶极的封建把头。北京市军事管制委员会，将对这些把头，分别予以审讯，根据他们的罪行，依法惩办。
    在控诉会上，北京市总工会副主席张鸿舜讲话时指出：封建把头制度是发展建筑业的大障碍，是压在建筑工人身上的石头，必须彻底、干净地粉碎它。他说明：对于罪大恶极、群众痛恨、有严重剥削压迫行为的大把头，要坚决反对，并要求政府依法惩办。对没有严重罪行的中、小把头必须争取改造，要他们向工人低头认错，拿出技术，与广大工人站在一起为基本建设事业服务。
    工人孙国梁头一个登台控诉大把头刘启麟的罪恶。他说：大把头刘启麟无恶不作，把咱们工人的脖子掏得出不来气，他不准工人入工会，造谣工会是“税局”。诬蔑咱们“抗美援朝”，说这是政府要工人捐钱。工人对刘启麟的压迫稍有反抗，就立刻被他解雇。有一次，工人被他开除了二百多。孙国梁流着眼泪控诉把头打骂工人兄弟的罪行，他列举刘启麟怎样光图赚钱，偷工减料，破坏国家建设的事实。他要求政府严惩罪大恶极的大把头，彻底消灭封建把头制度。工人温良恭控诉大把头徐芝森强占工人的老婆，把头的狗腿子佟俊祥鸡奸小工。以前工人对他们这些兽行，连提都不敢提，到今天工人们才出了这口冤气。温良恭继续控诉说：大把头刘启麟等这一伙恶霸，除开毒辣地用克扣工资、延长工时等办法剥削工人之外，还偷窃建筑材料、虚报“黑工”。去年在三个工程中，刘启麟一共贪污了六亿七千万元。大把头于富贵是世袭的封建把头，他掌握着较大的土工工程，他有两个老婆、三个管账先生、一个秘书，残酷压迫、剥削工人，整天大吃大喝。工人萧炳光控诉时，问道：“他们的钱是那来的？”工人们一致回答说：“剥削咱们工人的！”他问：“要不要清算？”工人们一致回答：“要清算！”紧接着，台下群众又不断高呼“消灭把头制度！”等口号。大把头支振斌同时是大恶霸、大汉奸，工人吴耕野等控诉他当过日寇的“剿共建国军副司令”，残害人民，拐卖妇女，无所不为。解放后，他混进某军事机关经管建筑工程，用“卖底合标”的办法，勾结私商合伙贪污。大把头张世汉今年到处乱包工程，工棚还没搭好，就把工资拐骗潜逃。
    控诉结束，由北京市军事管制委员会军法处王斐然处长讲话，他说：军法处根据大会控诉，接受大家要求，立刻加紧调查依法处理。（全场高呼：“坚决拥护人民政府！”）市建设局局长王明之、市劳动局副局长马光斗都在会上讲了话，一致表示坚决支持工人反对封建把头制度的要求。在自由讲话时，工人代表王大川说：“共产党和工会领导我们把封建把头斗倒了。我们一定保证提高生产、不浪费材料，以实际行动来答谢毛主席对我们的关切。”工程师顾传询说：“今天，我们搬掉了压在头上的大石头，看见青天了。我深深认识到要搞好建筑工程，必须和工人团结在一起，斗倒封建把头！检举那些还隐藏着的封建把头！”北京市营造业同业公会主任委员刘元敬说：“封建把头像一堵墙一样，把劳资双方隔离开，一方面假借厂方名义向工人盘剥榨取，一方面蒙骗工人向厂方要挟勒索。现在劳资双方紧密团结起来，一定能彻底摧毁封建把头制度。”公营隆华建筑公司副理王挺说：“公司行政方面一定为工人撑腰，把封建把头斗倒！”大会在下午五点多钟结束，散会时全场高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
