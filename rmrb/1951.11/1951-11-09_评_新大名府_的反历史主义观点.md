    Critique of the Anti-Historical Viewpoint of "New Daming Prefecture"
    A Jia
    In the work of opera reform, correcting the anti-historical errors in the creation of historical dramas should be regarded as an important issue in literary and artistic thought. There are quite a few scripts with anti-historical content, and "New Daming Prefecture" is one of them.
    "New Daming Prefecture" is adapted from *Water Margin* and based on the script of "Old Daming Prefecture." Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, the author, believes that "New Daming Prefecture" is fundamentally different from "Old Daming Prefecture." In his preface, he says:
    "What is the main content of the 'New Daming Prefecture' script? It adapts to the actual situation of the Chinese revolution and the resistance to national aggression by writing about the struggle between armed revolution and armed counter-revolution, disintegrating the counter-revolutionary class and strengthening the revolutionary class, reflecting that the victory of the national war is determined by the victory of the class struggle. In the class struggle, it reflects the different political directions of servants and slaves, reflecting that the liberation of women is determined by the liberation of the class, reflecting the development of the united front..." He criticized Old Daming Prefecture, saying:
    "The old version of 'Daming Prefecture' has been very popular on stage for many years. However, that script only wrote about an event of 'adultery between master and servant' and 'scheming to seize property and take a wife by force,' and the performance image is nothing more than a lively one. In terms of its feudal content and evil consequences, the old version of Daming Prefecture should be completely banned..."
    The author believes that "New Daming Prefecture" is a "model" created in the reform of opera. Through this play, the author wants to illustrate that Liangshan Marsh carried out class struggle against the feudal rule of the Song Dynasty in order to win the victory of the national war, and shattered the joint offensive of the military alliance of national enemies and class enemies. How was this war won? First, by relying on Song Jiang's correct implementation of the united front policy within the ruling class, and second, by relying on the support of the slave class represented by Yan Qing and Chunmei. I think it is inappropriate to reflect the revolutionary movement of Liangshan Marsh in this way. Indeed, a literary creation allows the author's imagination. *Water Margin* was originally a literary work with class struggle thought developed based on folk stories. The so-called official history has a very simple record of this matter. *Song History - Biography of Hou Meng* states:
    "Song Jiang raided Jingdong, and Meng wrote to the emperor saying: Jiang, with thirty-six people, roamed Qi and Wei; tens of thousands of government troops dared not resist him, his talent must be extraordinary." Also, *Song History - Biography of Zhang Shuye* states:
    "Song Jiang rose up in Hebei, plundered ten prefectures, and the government troops dared not confront his advance." The other records, such as those in "Tongjian Jilan," are generally similar.
    This determines that if we want to write the Liangshan opera "Daming Prefecture," we can only rely on *Water Margin*. Since *Water Margin* is a historical novel created by Shi Nai'an based on folk legends, can't we develop *Water Margin* further and create a "New Daming Prefecture" historical opera? Yes, the so-called development, I think its meaning is only to analyze the historical situation at that time with a new historical perspective. In terms of creation, it allows you to use creative imagination to reflect the possible situations and events that may occur in historical reality. Undoubtedly, this possibility requires compliance with the historical conditions at that time. We must learn to analyze history and historical figures from the perspective of historical materialism. But we cannot force historical figures to have the ideological viewpoints of the Mao Zedong era. Otherwise, it is an anti-historical viewpoint. The Peking Opera "New Daming Prefecture" was created from this perspective.
    First, the author combines the national war between the Northern Song Dynasty and the Jin people with the class struggle between the people of Daming Prefecture and Liangshan Marsh from the very beginning, as the backbone of this play. It shows that if Liangshan Marsh wants to win the national war, it must first resolve the class opposition between Liangshan Marsh and Daming Prefecture. Therefore, in the first scene, Song Jiang raises the following question:
    "Song Jiang: I, named Song Jiang, known as Timely Rain, only because the Jin invaders invaded, and the Zengtou City was occupied by the enemy, Brother Chao raised troops to punish the thieves, and was unfortunately shot to death by Shi Wengong! The brothers vowed to avenge Brother Chao, but Zengtou City is strong, and they did not dare to act rashly. They ordered Dai Zong to go to inquire, why hasn't he arrived?
    "Dai Zong: Zengtou City has secret dealings with Daming Prefecture, and Shi Wengong and Lu Junyi, a hero of Hebei, are classmates. The thief Shi intends to collude with him to resist Liangshan."
    I believe that although we draw material from the *Water Margin* romance, we don't have to stick to historical facts, but it is certain that the issue reflected in *Water Margin* is class struggle, not national struggle. The era of Song Jiang's activities and the era of Fang La's activities were both during the second and third years of the Xuanhe reign of Emperor Huizong of the Northern Song Dynasty. At that time, Fang La's uprising was in the south of the Yangtze River, and Song Jiang was in the north of the Yangtze River. Regarding Song Jiang's rebellion, "Dongdu Shilu" states:
    "In February of the third year of Xuanhe (1121 AD), the Huainan bandit Song Jiang invaded Huaiyang Army (now Pixu County, northern Jiangsu). He also invaded Tokyo and Hebei, and entered Chuhai Prefecture (now Donghai County, Shandong)."
    That period was indeed an era of foreign ethnic group invasion. The uprisings of Fang La, Song Jiang, and others naturally had a causal relationship with the national war at that time. The exploited people were extremely opposed to the rulers dedicating the plundered goods to foreign ethnic groups and compromising with them. Fang Yun's "Qingxi Kougui" describes the motivations for Fang La's uprising, and it explains this point very clearly. However, the foreign ethnic group invasions during the era of Fang La and Song Jiang were first the Liao, then the Western Xia, and then the Jin. At this time, the Song Dynasty was precisely allying with the Jin to fight the Liao. The Jin invasion of China began in the seventh year of Xuanhe. This was four years after Song Jiang's defeat. This shows that Song Jiang's participation in the national war against the Jin invaders is not in accordance with the facts.
    Second, there is the issue of the united front. Song Jiang took all means to win over Lu Junyi, but he did not change the landlord stance of Lu the Squire. Lu Junyi went to Liangshan because he was forced to. Please see the dialogue between Song Jiang and Lu in the 62nd chapter of *Water Margin*:
    "Song Jiang slaughtered sheep and horses and held a grand banquet, inviting Squire Lu to attend, repeatedly and humbly letting him sit in the middle. After several rounds of wine, Song Jiang got up to offer a toast, saying politely: 'I was very offensive last night, I hope you will forgive me. Although the mountain village is small and unworthy of resting horses, you can look at the face of the words 'Loyalty and Righteousness'; Song Jiang is willing to give up his position, don't refuse.'
    "Lu Junyi replied: 'Head leader is wrong! I have no guilt or burden, and I have some family property; I was born as a person of the Great Song, and I will die as a ghost of the Great Song, and it is difficult to obey even if I die.'"
    "Old Daming Prefecture" writes even more specifically. After Lu was captured and taken to the mountain, the dialogue between Liangshan and Lu is:
    "Wu Yong: Yesterday, elder brother specially ordered Wu Yong to pretend to be a fortune teller and go to the mansion to hire the squire to go up the mountain to gather for righteousness and forgive his sins in person!
    Lu Junyi: It is always Mr. good at Yin and Yang, good at tricks! (They laugh together)
    Song Jiang: Please sit down!
    Lu Junyi: There is no seat for Lu.
    Song Jiang: How can there be no reason not to sit. ... Frighten the squire! I really admire your great virtue, as hungry and thirsty, I humbly invite the squire to be the master of the mountain stronghold, and listen to your strict orders sooner or later.
    Lu Junyi: Lu does not expect to live here; kill him if you want to kill him, why bother joking.
    Song Jiang: Every sentence is the truth, how dare you joke.
    Lu Junyi: It is very easy for Lu to die, but it is difficult to obey.
    Song Jiang: You can look at the words of Loyalty and Righteousness, and act on behalf of the heavens together. Song Jiang is willing to give up his position, don't refuse.
    Lu Junyi: Hey! Head leader is wrong! Lu was born as a person of the Great Song, and will die as a ghost of the Great Song; it is okay not to mention loyalty and righteousness, but if you mention the words of loyalty and righteousness, Lu is willing to die here with a cavity of hot blood! Everyone, don't say any more.
    Gongsun Sheng: ... There is a saying that 'You can keep the squire's body, but you can't keep the squire's heart.' It is rare for you to come here, please wait in the mountain stronghold for a few days, and then send the squire down the mountain."
    Look, how blatant is Lu Junyi's landlord stance. In the "Court" scene of the "Old Daming Prefecture" drama, Lu Junyi's ruling class stance is even more obvious:
    "Liang Zhongshu: You death row prisoner, you were originally a good citizen of this place, why did you surrender to Liangshan, and now you have come to cooperate from the inside and take Daming Prefecture secretly. You have been captured today, why don't you confess the truth!
    "Lu Junyi: Oh, Lord! This humble man has lived in Beijing for five generations. My ancestors had no law-breaking sons, and my relatives had no remarried daughters. How dare this humble man deceive his ancestors and defect to the Liangshan bandits. I hope the Lord will see clearly!
    "Liang Zhongshu: Stop! You are still arguing. Let me ask you, if you didn't surrender to the bandits, how did you come back from Liangshan Marsh, tell me!
    "Lu Junyi: Oh, Lord! This humble man's life is destined to suffer a bloody disaster, so he went to Mount Tai in Dongyue to avoid disaster. On the way, I met a group of small thieves led by Song Jiang, who robbed the vehicles, captured this humble man and took him to the mountain, and persuaded me to join the gang. I vowed to never agree. I was imprisoned in Liangshan for more than two months, and only today was I released. I intended to kill the thieves and offer my merits, but I couldn't, how could I do that rebellion.
    "Liang Zhongshu: What kind of people are those on Liangshan, since they captured you and took you to the mountain, how could they let you return, even a three-year-old child would not believe it. Singing: This is a fool doing things without thinking, one person rebels and nine clans die, thinking that you won't tell the truth, eighty military sticks will beat the bully."
    "Old Daming Prefecture" describes the reactionary orthodox thinking of a big landlord in this way. However, in the "Court" section of "New Daming Prefecture," Lu Junyi shouted, "Liangshan rebels, the rebellion is justified, Lu Junyi rebels, Lu Junyi rebels, Lu Junyi defects to Liangshan to eliminate the traitor Liang Shijie! Singing: Lu Junyi defects to Liangshan to resist the Jin!" The author of "New Daming Prefecture" thus wrote the big landlord Lu Junyi into a revolutionary and national hero.
    At the same time, the author insists that Liangshan has a united front policy to win over Lu Junyi to defeat national aggression and class autocracy. Such "comparing the past to the present" is really inappropriate.
    Third, there is the issue of how "New Daming Prefecture" handles the Jia clan. The author is also worried that the leaders of Liangshan made mistakes in the specific work of the united front. Since it is a united front, it is necessary to take care of the families of democratic figures, so the Jia clan, who was described in *Water Margin* as an object to expose the ugly history of the big landlord family, was beautified. In the script, the author also deliberately made her repent in order to criticize Jia's licentious behavior, and deliberately placed patriotism, national justice, and even the class justice of Liangshan Marsh on Jia, so that the decadent and degenerate noblewoman of the big landlord class established a revolutionary outlook on life, and finally went to Liangshan with her husband. The author's wish is nothing more than that historical figures, regardless of their class or background, as long as they clear their minds, are "all roads lead to revolution," that is, "sincerely burn incense, and everywhere is a holy mountain."
    The author specifically introduces this point in theory, saying: "... After Lu Junyi was arrested, Li Gu obtained an official position, Jia felt that she had undergone a drastic change, and she suffered oppression from Li Gu after leaving Lu Junyi. Her thinking underwent a drastic change. She repented of her romantic and hedonistic mistakes, and felt even more respectable and lovable for Lu Junyi's righteous actions. This further became the basis for Chunmei's support of Jia... After Chunmei and Yan Qing explained the situation, Lu Junyi and Jia resumed their marital relationship. This shows that the marital relationship between Lu Junyi and Jia was originally ambiguous in thought, and it was precisely because of the ambiguity that contradictions and drastic changes occurred; after that, the marital relationship between Lu Junyi and Jia was based on the principle of justice and was meaningful..."
    The author requires that the noblewoman of the big landlord class fully agree with her husband's defection to Liangshan, believing that this is a respectable and lovable righteous act, and even the marital relationship has a new principle because of this. What is the basis for this approach? If her husband becomes a revolutionary, it would be unsightly if the wife does not revolt. Let's give her some political care! However, *Water Margin* and "Old Daming Prefecture" also wrote about Jia's landlord stance bluntly. When Liang Zhongshu interrogated Lu Junyi in *Water Margin*, he said: "... If you don't communicate with them in Liangshan Marsh, how could you have stayed there for so long; your wife and Li Gu have filed a lawsuit and reported you, how can this be false?" Li Gu said: "Since the master has arrived here, he should confess. The hidden poems written on the wall at home are the best evidence, there is no need to say more." Jia said: "It's not that we want to harm you, we are just afraid that you will implicate us. As the saying goes: 'One person rebels, and nine clans are exterminated!'" These confessions strongly express Jia's class nature.
    In the "Living Sacrifice" scene of "Old Daming Prefecture," this point is also very obvious. When Lu Junyi was about to be executed at the execution ground, Jia rushed to pay her respects to express her final farewell to her husband and wife. In Jia's singing of "Zhu Ma Ting," there are these lines: "... Unexpectedly, the enemy, committed a major crime of rebellion, the death penalty in the city, one life stained with yellow sand. Alas, husband and wife are enemies..." Here, the relationship between husband and wife and politics is very clear. I will pay my respects to you in terms of husband and wife, but in terms of political relations, you are my enemy, because one is still a noblewoman of the big landlord class, and the other has been determined to be a person of Liangshan Marsh.
    Fourth, there is the relationship between Jia and Li Gu, Chunmei, Yan Qing, etc., and the issue of "women's liberation is determined by class liberation." When Li Gu returned from Liangshan first, and Lu Junyi was still in Liangshan, but Jia had not yet despaired, Jia still favored Li Gu, and although Li Gu abused his power in every way, it was still a relationship between master and servant. "New Daming Prefecture" writes this well. However, when Lu Junyi was interrogated by the government and was indeed sentenced to death, and Li Gu became a squire, the situation was very different. However, "New Daming Prefecture" describes Jia feeling that the relationship between husband and wife is more principled and meaningful because Lu Junyi was sentenced to be a Liangshan bandit; this sudden change is really strange. According to the author, the reason for this is that she was ideologically educated by the male servant (Yan Qing) and the maid (Chunmei); especially Chunmei's education. The author believes that Jia's awakening and Chunmei's progress are the liberation of women. As the author said: "... Reflecting that the victory of the national war is determined by the victory of the class struggle, reflecting the different political directions of servants and slaves in the class struggle, reflecting that women's liberation is determined by class liberation, reflecting the development of the united front..." That's right, women's liberation is determined by class liberation. However, historical peasant revolutions could not liberate women. The true liberation of Chinese women was in the era of Mao Zedong. The author said: "... After that, the marital relationship between Lu Junyi and Jia was based on the principle of justice and was meaningful. This was due to the decisive role played by Yan Qing and Chunmei, and at this time Yan Qing and Chunmei were no longer male servants and maids but figures in class liberation..." This is just the author's fabrication for the "women's liberation" in the Northern Song Dynasty.
    The difference in the political direction of servants and slaves (here, slaves do not refer to the class difference from servants, but the difference in quality) is not that they have such high political consciousness without class education; this is inseparable from class liberation. The "New Daming Prefecture" drama attributes Liangshan Marsh's disintegration of the rule of Daming Prefecture, the development of the united front, the winning over of Lu Junyi, and the care of Jia to their reliance on the results of Yan Qing and Chunmei, meaning reliance on the proletariat, which is completely contrary to history.
    In short, the creative method of "New Daming Prefecture" is to write ancient people as modern people, not to criticize history with the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism. It portrays such a model: develop a united front; oppose autocracy and dictatorship; rely on the proletariat; overthrow imperialism. This is obviously a subjective fabrication imposed by the author on history.
    I think that although there are some things in "New Daming Prefecture" that can be retained, its basic content is anti-historical. In "Old Daming Prefecture," the
    "adultery between master and servant" and "scheming to seize property and take a wife by force" as problems within the landlord class, it is not entirely impossible to write about them. We don't have to maintain any ethics and morality for the landlord class, but we should not take "repaying kindness with hatred" as the theme. The "Old Daming Prefecture" script takes "repaying kindness with hatred" as the main content of the play, and treats the class struggle of Liangshan only as a lively story to intersperse, which is wrong. The excessive emphasis on the relationship between Li Gu and Jia in the plot is also wrong.
    I am not an exception to making mistakes of anti-historicalism when writing historical dramas. In some scripts, this method of "borrowing other people's wine glasses to pour out one's own sorrows" played a positive role in the era of reactionary government rule. This era is over, and we should study history well and reflect history correctly; we should no longer use historical figures to serve ourselves and to express the insights we have gained in political study. Otherwise, those historical figures will always walk in front of you, acting as translators for your thoughts and words. If this kind of play truly educates the audience, it is nothing more than proving that each generation is worse than the last, which is just a saying of "praising the past and criticizing the present."

    评“新大名府”的反历史主义观点
    阿甲
    在戏曲改革工作中，纠正历史剧创作中的反历史主义的错误观点，应该看作是文艺思想上一个重要的问题。内容具有反历史观点的剧本，并不是少的，“新大名府”就是其中的一个。
    “新大名府”取材于水浒传，并参考了“旧大名府”的本子改编而成。作者杨绍萱同志认为“新大名府”和“旧大名府”有本质上的不同。他在序言中说：
    “‘新大名府’这个剧本，主要的是写一个什么内容呢？它是适应着中国革命实际情况和反抗民族侵略而写了一个武装革命和武装反革命的斗争，瓦解反革命阶级而壮大革命阶级，反映民族战争的胜利是决定于阶级斗争的胜利，在阶级斗争中，反映奴才和奴隶的政治方向的不同，反映妇女解放是决定于阶级的解放，反映统一战线的开展……”他批评旧大名府说：
    “旧编‘大名府’在舞台上很流行过若干年。但是，那个剧本不过是写了一个‘主仆通奸’和‘谋产霸妻’的事件，而演出形象也不外是一个热闹。若从这封建主义的内容和恶果来说，旧本大名府是应完全停演的。……”
    作者认为“新大名府”是戏曲改革中创作的“范例”。作者通过这个剧要来说明梁山泊是为了争取民族战争的胜利，就对宋朝的封建统治进行了阶级斗争，一举粉碎了民族敌人和阶级敌人军事同盟的联合进攻。这个战争如何胜利的呢？一是依靠宋江在统治阶级的内部正确地开展了统一战线的政策，二是依靠燕青、春梅奴隶阶级的支持。我认为这样反映梁山泊的革命运动是不合适的。不错，一个文艺创作，是允许作者的想像的，水浒传原是根据民间流传的故事发展而成的一部具有阶级斗争思想的文艺作品。所谓正史，对这件事的记载却非常简单。宋史侯蒙传称：
    “宋江寇京东，蒙上书言：江以三十六人，横行齐魏；官军数万，无敢抗者，其才必过人。”又宋史张叔夜传称：
    “宋江起河朔，转略十郡，官军莫敢婴其锋。”其余如“通鉴辑览”所记载的，大体都差不多。
    这里便决定我们如果要写“大名府”这一出梁山戏，只有根据水浒传。水浒传既是施耐庵根据民间流传而创作的一部历史小说，难道我们就不可以将水浒传再发展一步创作一个“新大名府”的历史戏曲吗？可以的，所谓发展，我想它的意义也只是以新的历史观点，来分析当时的历史情况。在创作来说，即是允许你以创作的想像，来反映历史现实可能产生的情况与事件。无疑的，这个可能，是要求合乎当时的历史条件的。我们必须学习以历史唯物主义的观点，来分析历史，分析历史人物。但不能强使历史人物具有毛泽东时代的思想观点。否则，即是反历史主义的观点。京剧“新大名府”，就是以这样的观点来创作的。
    第一、作者一开头便将北宋与金人的民族战争和大名府与梁山泊人民的阶级斗争结合在一起，作为构成这一剧本的骨干。说明梁山泊若要取得民族战争的胜利，必须先解决梁山泊与大名府的阶级对立。因此，在第一场戏中，宋江的口里便提出这样的问题：
    “宋江：俺，姓宋名江，人称及时雨，只因金寇入侵，曾头市被敌人占据，晁大哥举兵讨贼，不幸被史文恭一箭射死！弟兄们誓要与大哥报仇，怎奈曾头市兵力不弱，未敢卤莽从事，曾命戴宗前去打探，为何不见到来？
    “戴宗：那曾头市与大名府暗有来往，史文恭与河北豪杰卢俊义乃同窗好友，史贼有意前去与他勾结，对抗梁山。”
    我认为，我们取材于水浒传演义，虽不必拘泥于历史事实，可是关于水浒传所反映的问题是阶级斗争，并不是什么民族斗争，这一点是可以肯定的。宋江活动的时代，和方腊活动的时代，同是在北宋徽宗宣和二年至三年。那时方腊起义在长江之南，宋江在江北。关于宋江的发难，“东都事略”称：
    “宣和三年（公元一一二一年）二月，淮南盗宋江，犯淮阳军（今苏北邳睢县）。又犯东京、河北，入楚海州（今山东东海县）。”
    那个时期，确是处于异民族侵略的时代，方腊、宋江等的起义，自然和当时的民族战争有因果的关系。被剥削的人民，极端反对统治者将剥削来的东西奉献给异族，和异族妥协。方匀“青溪寇轨”叙述方腊起义的动因，对这一点讲得很明白。可是方腊宋江时代的异族侵略，一是辽，一是西夏，一是金；此时宋朝，正是联合金打辽的时候。金侵略中国，是开始在宣和七年。这已是宋江失败之后四年的事。这就说明宋江参加对金人的反侵略的民族战争，是不合事实的。
    第二、是关于统一战线的问题。宋江对卢俊义是采取一切手段去争取的，然而并没有转变卢员外的地主立场。卢俊义上梁山，是被逼的。请看水浒第六十二回宋卢两人的对话：
    “宋江杀羊宰马大排筵宴，请卢员外来赴席，再三再四，谦让在中间里坐了。酒至数巡，宋江起身把盏，陪话道：‘夜来甚是冲撞，幸望宽恕。虽然山寨窄小，不堪歇马，员外可看“忠义”二字之面；宋江情愿让位，休得推却。’
    “卢俊义答道：‘头领差矣！小可身无罪累，颇有些少家私；生为大宋人，死为大宋鬼，宁死实难听从。’”
    “旧大名府”写得更具体了，卢被俘上山后，梁山和卢的对话是：
    “吴用：昨日兄长特命吴用，假妆相算，到府聘员外上山，共聚大义，当面恕罪！
    卢俊义：总是先生好阴阳，好鬼计！（同笑）
    宋江：请坐！
    卢俊义：那有卢某的坐位。
    宋江：怎有不坐之理。……吓员外！在下实慕盛德，如饥如渴，屈请员外为山寨之主，早晚拱听严命。
    卢俊义：卢某到此，不望生矣；要杀便杀，何必戏言。
    宋江：句句实言，怎敢戏也。
    卢俊义：卢某要死极易，要从实难矣。
    宋江：员外可看忠义二字，一同替天行道。宋江情愿让位，休得推却。
    卢俊义：呔！头领差矣！卢某生为大宋人，死为大宋鬼；不提忠义则可，若提忠义二字，卢某情愿一腔热血，死于此处！列位不必多言了。
    公孙胜：……有道是‘留得员外身，留不得员外心’，难得大驾到此，且请在山寨略俟几日，再送员外下山便了。”
    你看，卢俊义的地主立场何等露骨。“旧大名府”剧中“公堂”一场，表现卢俊义统治阶级的立场更明显了：
    “梁中书：你这死囚，尔本此地良民，因何归降梁山，如今到来里应外合，暗取大名府，今日被擒，尔还不从实招来！
    “卢俊义：哎呀大人吓！小人兴居北京五代，祖宗无犯法之男，亲族无再婚之女，小人焉敢欺宗灭祖，投奔梁山贼寇。望大人明镜！
    “梁中书：住了！你还强辩。我且问你，既不投顺贼寇，怎么打梁山泊回来，你讲！
    “卢俊义：哎呀大人吓！小人命犯血光之灾，往东岳泰山避祸。路遇宋江一伙小贼，将车辆劫去，擒小人上山，劝我入伙，小人誓死不允。软禁梁山二月有余，到今日才得放回，小人意欲杀贼献功，乃不能够，岂肯做那反叛。
    “梁中书：那梁山上是些什么样人，既然擒你上山，岂肯放你回转，就是三岁孩童，也不相信。唱：此乃愚人做事不思想，一人反叛九族亡，打量实言你不讲，八十军棍打强梁。”
    “旧大名府”是这样来描写一个大地主反动的正统思想的。而“新大名府”在“公堂”一节中，卢俊义却大呼“梁山造反，反得有理，卢俊义反，卢俊义反哪，卢俊义投奔梁山，要消灭奸贼梁世杰！唱：卢俊义投梁山，共抗金邦！”“新大名府”的作者，就这样把大地主卢俊义写成了革命志士、民族英雄。
    同时，作者硬要使梁山有统一战线政策，以争取卢俊义，来战胜民族的侵略和阶级的专制压迫。这样“将古比今”，实在很不合适。
    第三、是“新大名府”处理贾氏的问题。作者又耽心梁山领袖在统一战线的具体工作上犯了错误。既然是统一战线，就须要照顾民主人士的家属，于是便将水浒传中作为暴露大地主家庭丑史来描写的对象贾氏，把她美化了。作者在剧本中又为了批判贾氏的放荡行为，有意使她改过自新，有意将爱国主义、民族的正义感，甚至梁山泊阶级的正义感，安置在贾氏的身上，这样好叫那腐朽堕落的大地主阶级的贵妇人，建立了革命的人生观，最后和她的丈夫同奔梁山。作者这种愿望，无非是要历史上的人物，不管什么阶级，什么出身，只要打通思想，便是“条条大路通革命”，即所谓“诚心烧香，到处都是灵山”。
    作者在理论上特别介绍这一点，说：“……到卢俊义被捕之后，李固得了官职，贾氏感到身遭剧变，离开卢俊义而受到李固的压迫，思想上发生了剧烈的变化，悔悟到自己浪漫享乐的错误，更感到卢俊义正义行动的可敬可爱，这进一步又成为春梅支持贾氏的根据，……经春梅燕青说明原委，卢俊义和贾氏才恢复了夫妻关系。这就看出，卢俊义和贾氏的夫妻关系在思想上原来是模糊的，正因模糊才发生了矛盾和剧变；此后卢俊义和贾氏的夫妻关系是建立在正义的原则之上，是有意义的。……”
    作者要求大地主阶级的贵妇人，十分赞成他的丈夫投奔梁山，认为这是可敬可爱的正义行为，连夫妻关系也因此有了新的原则，这种处理方法，不知根据什么？老公革命了，做老婆的如果不革命，不好看；政治上来一个照顾吧！可是，水浒传和“旧大名府”写贾氏的地主立场也是露骨的。水浒传上写梁中书审问卢俊义时说：“……你在梁山泊中，若不通情，如何住了许多时；见放着你的妻子并李固告状出首，怎地是虚？”李固道：“主人既到这里，招伏了罢。家中壁上见写下藏头反诗，便是老大的证见，不必多说。”贾氏道：“不是我们要害你，只怕你连累我，常言道：‘一人造反，九族全诛！’”这些口供，却强烈地表现了贾氏的阶级性。
    在“旧大名府”的“活祭”一场中，关于这一点也表现得很明显，当卢俊义在刑场要执法时，贾氏赶去祭奠，以表示最后离别的夫妻情分。贾氏唱“驻马听”中，有这些剧辞：“…讵料冤家，自作叛逆犯律大，市曹典刑法，一命染黄沙。噎，夫妻是仇家。……”这里把夫妻和政治关系，说得很明确，在夫妻情份上祭你一下，在政治关系上，你是我的仇人，因为一个仍是大地主阶级的贵妇人，一个已确定为梁山泊的人了。
    第四、是关于贾氏和李固、春梅、燕青等人的关系，以及“妇女解放是决定于阶级解放”的问题。当李固先从梁山回来，卢俊义还留在梁山，但还没有使贾氏绝望之时，贾氏虽宠爱李固，李固虽多方擅权，终还是主人和奴才的关系。这一点，“新大名府”是写得好的。但是，当卢俊义被官府审讯，确已判成死罪，而李固变成员外的时候，情况就大不同了。而“新大名府”却描写贾氏因卢俊义被判为梁山强盗，反因此感到夫妻的关系更有原则，更有意义；这种突然的转变，实在太奇怪了。其所以至此，据作者说也是有来由的，就是受了男奴（燕青）女婢（春梅）的思想教育；特别是春梅的教育。贾氏的觉悟，春梅的进步，作者都认为是妇女的解放。如作者所说：“……反映民族战争的胜利，是决定于阶级斗争的胜利，在阶级斗争中，反映奴才和奴隶的政治方向的不同，反映妇女解放是决定于阶级的解放，反映统一战线的开展。……”对的，妇女解放是决定于阶级的解放。但历史上的农民革命，还不可能使妇女解放。中国妇女的真正解放，是在毛泽东的时代。作者说：“……此后卢俊义和贾氏的夫妻关系是建立在正义原则之上，是有意义的，这是由燕青春梅所起的决定作用，而此时燕青春梅已不是男奴女婢乃是阶级解放中的人物了……”这不过是作者为北宋时代的“妇女解放”作一番臆造罢了。
    奴才和奴隶（这里所指奴隶，不是说和奴才有阶级上的区别，而是品质上的区别）政治方向之不同，也并不是不经过阶级教育就有那么高的政治自觉；这和阶级解放分不开。“新大名府”剧中将梁山泊瓦解大名府的统治，开展统一战线，争取卢俊义，照顾贾氏等等都归功于他们依靠燕青春梅的结果，意味着依靠无产阶级，这是完全违反历史的。
    总之，“新大名府”的创作法，是把古代人当作现代人来写，不是用马列主义的观点来批判历史。它刻划着这样一套模型：开展统一战线；反对专制独裁；依靠无产阶级；打倒帝国主义。这显然是作者强加到历史上去的主观臆造的内容。
    我觉得“新大名府”中虽然有一些可以保留的东西，但它的基本内容是反历史的。“旧大名府”中的
    “主仆通奸”和“谋产霸妻”作为地主阶级内部的问题来暴露的话，并不是全都不可以写的，我们不必为地主阶级去维护什么人伦道德，但是不应以“恩将仇报”作主题。“旧大名府”剧本将“恩将仇报”作为戏的主要内容，而将梁山的阶级斗争只当作一个热闹故事来穿插，这是不对的。剧情中过分强调李固和贾氏的关系也是不对的。
    写历史剧而犯反历史主义观点的错误，我也不是例外。有些剧本中这种“借他人酒杯，浇自己块垒”的方法，在反动政府统治的时代，曾起过积极的作用。这个时代已经结束了，我们应当好好地学习历史，正确地反映历史；再不要借历史的人物为自己服务，来发挥自己在政治学习所获的心得。不然那历史上的人物，将永远走在你的前面，为你的思想言论当翻译。如果这种戏真正教育了观众，那也无非是证明一代不如一代，这只是一种“颂古非今”的说法。
