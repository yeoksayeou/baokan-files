English leaflets calling for support for the Egyptian people's struggle had been distributed in many British barracks in the Suez Canal Zone.
    The British military authorities had specially dispatched "education officers" to explain to British soldiers that British aggression in Egypt was "necessary" for self-defense.

　　苏彝士运河区一部分英军
    因同情埃及人民斗争被囚禁
    【新华社十五日讯】电通社特拉维夫八日讯：据埃及进步周报“安纳斯”称：一百九十名英军因为拒绝向在伊士美利亚示威游行的埃及工人开枪，而被囚禁在苏彝士。其他的英国士兵曾提出抗议，并对埃及人民的民族解放运动表示同情。在苏彝士运河区的许多英国兵营中，曾散发有号召声援埃及人民的斗争的英文传单。
    英军事当局曾特别派遣“教育官员”向英国兵士们解释，说英国在埃及的侵略是自卫所“必需的”。
