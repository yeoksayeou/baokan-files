    Northeast Fifth Paper Mill Workers
    Set National Record for Cooking Time of Papermaking Raw Materials
    In the production increase and economy drive, workers at the state-owned Fifth Northeast Paper Mill continuously improved their operating techniques, shortening the cooking time for papermaking raw materials from twelve hours per pot to eight hours and twenty minutes, setting a national record.
    The original highest daily output of the mill's pulping workshop was six pots of pulp. After the launch of the production increase and economy drive, Wang Xuejiang, a worker in the C shift of the pulping workshop's cooking room, along with technicians Luo Hengyi and Song Anmin, researched a method to shorten cooking time by changing the indirect steaming of the large pots to a combination of direct and indirect steaming. After multiple experiments, Wang Xuejiang and others successfully tested the method on October 13th, shortening the cooking time per pot from twelve hours to ten hours and seventeen minutes, increasing the daily output from six pots to seven pots. In this way, they could increase the nation's wealth by the equivalent of one hundred tons of grain every day. Based on this, workers in the C shift's Lu Fengzhi group accurately mastered the steaming time, shortening the cooking time per pot to nine hours and ten minutes. This record increased pulp production by 85 percent compared to the national plan, exceeding the highest production volume of the puppet Manchukuo in 1944 by 118 percent. On November 7th, they further set a new record of cooking one pot of pulp in eight hours and twenty minutes, while maintaining the original quality.

    东北第五造纸厂职工
    创蒸煮造纸原料时间的全国最高纪录
    东北国营第五造纸厂职工在增产节约运动中，不断改进操作技术，使蒸煮造纸原料的蒸煮时间由每罐十二小时缩短到八时二十分，创造了全国的最高纪录。
    该厂制蒸车间原来的最高日产量是六罐纸浆。增产节约运动开展后，制蒸车间蒸煮室丙班工人王学江和技术员骆亨溢、宋安民三人就研究出把大罐的间接通汽改为直接通汽与间接通汽结合来缩短蒸煮时间的办法。经过多次试验，王学江等在十月十三日试验成功，使每罐蒸煮时间由十二小时缩短到十小时十七分，日产量由六罐提高到七罐。这样，每天就可为国家增产价值一百吨粮食的财富。在这个基础上，丙班吕凤智小组工人又正确地掌握了通汽时间，使每罐蒸煮时间缩短到九时十分。这一纪录，使纸浆产量较国家计划提高了百分之八十五，超过一九四四年伪满最高生产量的百分之一百十八。十一月七日，他们又进一步创造了八时二十分蒸煮一罐纸浆的新纪录，质量仍保持原有水平。
