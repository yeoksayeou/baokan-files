Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 20th – The second year of the massive Huai River project has partially commenced. The Baisha Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Ying River and the Banqiao Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Ru River already have over 100,000 laborers at work. The project to manage the Hong River and Ru River in the Xinyang Special District commenced on the 1st of this month.

The second year of the Huai River project is larger in scale than the first year. The majority of flood storage projects in the upper and middle reaches, the majority of dredging projects, and the main components of the diversion and irrigation projects in the lower reaches will be constructed during the second year. The work to manage drainage ditches and canals in the Huai River basin and to promote soil and water conservation will also be widely initiated among the vast number of farmers during the second year. The total earthwork will be nearly 400 million cubic meters, exceeding the first year by nearly one-fold. The labor force participating in the project will reach 5 million people. In terms of flood storage projects, in addition to the two large-scale mountain valley reservoirs at Baisha and Banqiao being completed during the second year, the Nanwan Reservoir tunnel in the upper reaches of the Huai River's main stream, the Boshan Reservoir tunnel in the upper reaches of the Ru River, and the Foziling Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Pi River in the Dabie Mountains are all major projects for the second year. The Foziling Reservoir is the largest mountain valley reservoir in the Huai River plan, with a very large engineering scale and requiring a large amount of equipment and materials. In order to transport engineering equipment and materials, the Huai River Commission has built a 60-kilometer road from Lu'an to the reservoir construction site. In terms of river dredging and management, a total of twelve rivers in the upper reaches of the Hong River, Ru River, Ying River, and various tributaries in the Yellow River flooded area will be dredged and managed during the second year. In the middle reaches, the Hong River diversion channel project will be undertaken to reduce the flow of the Huai River mainstream at the Hong River estuary, and the Fengshan and Xiacaowan diversion rivers will be excavated so that the Tang River, Hui River, Chong River, Tong River, and Tuo River can directly flow into Hongze Lake, in order to eliminate the backflow and reverse irrigation of the Huai River on various tributaries during the flood season, make drainage of various tributaries smooth, and relieve waterlogging disasters in vast areas. In the lower reaches, in addition to the annual maintenance project of the Grand Canal and the dredging and management projects of the three tributaries of the An River system, the main project is to excavate a North Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal from Gaoliangjian of Hongze Lake towards the Yellow Sea coast, capable of discharging a flow of 700 cubic meters per second. This canal can irrigate 25 million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu.

During the second year, soil and water conservation work will be universally promoted in the upper reaches of the Huai River. In the plain areas of the upper and middle reaches, with the assistance of loans from the Central People's Government, ponds will be universally dug, embankments will be built, dams will be constructed, wells will be dug, and ditches will be excavated. These projects will be launched and assisted by the Huai River Commission and local people's governments with the self-organization of the peasant masses. This is also a very important part of the Huai River project, with an earthwork volume of 200 million cubic meters.

After the completion of the second year of the Huai River project, the flood peak of the Huai River can be further reduced, the harm of "major floods and major disasters" can be greatly reduced, and the scourge of waterlogging in most areas can be eliminated, and a foundation will also be laid for water storage and irrigation in the Huai River basin to eliminate drought disasters.

    治淮第二年度巨大工程部分开工
    全部工程土工近四亿公方参加工程的民工将达五百万人
   【新华社蚌埠二十日电】治淮第二年的巨大工程，现已有部分开工。颍河上游的白沙水库和汝河上游的板桥水库，已有十几万民工上工。信阳专区整理洪河、汝河的工程，本月一日就已动工。
    第二年度治淮工程比第一年度规模更大，上中游的部分蓄洪工程、大部疏浚工程，和下游分流灌溉工程的主要部分，都将在第二年度内兴修。整理淮河流域的沟渠排水工程和推行水土保持工作，也将在第二年度内发动广大农民普遍进行。全部工程土工近四亿公方，超过第一年度近一倍。参加工程的民工将达五百万人。在蓄洪工程方面，除白沙、板桥两个大型山谷水库将在第二年度内修成外，淮河干流上游的南湾水库隧道、汝河上游的薄山水库隧道，和大别山区淠河上游的佛子岭水库，都是第二年度内的重大工程。佛子岭水库是治淮计划中的最大的一个山谷水库，工程规模很大，需用器材很多。为了运送工程器材，治淮委员会已由六安到水库工地修了一条六十公里长的公路。在河道疏浚和整理方面，上游洪河、汝河、颍河和黄泛区各支流共十二条，将在第二年度内疏浚整理；中游将举办洪河分洪道工程，以削减洪河口淮河干流流量，开挖峰山和下草湾引河，使唐河、浍河、漴河、潼河和沱河等河能直接流入洪泽湖，以免除洪水期间淮河对各支流的顶托倒灌，使各支流排水顺畅，解除广大地区的内涝灾害。下游除运河岁修工程和安河水系三条支流的疏浚整理工程外，主要的工程是从洪泽湖高良涧起向黄海海岸开挖一条能下泄七百秒公方流量的苏北灌溉干渠。这条渠能灌溉苏北二千五百万亩农田。
    第二年度内，淮河上游要普遍推行水土保持工作。上中游平原地区，将在中央人民政府的贷款协助下，普遍挑塘、筑埝、打坝、挖井和开挖沟洫。这些工程将由治淮委员会和各地人民政府，发动并协助农民群众自办。这也是治淮工程中很重要的一部分，土方数字达二亿公方。
    第二年度治淮工程完成后，可以进一步削减淮河的洪水峰，大大减少“大雨大灾”和解除大部地区的内涝的祸害，同时也为淮河流域蓄水灌溉消灭旱灾奠定了基础。
