    Propaganda and Education Work Should Be Conducted Among the Masses During Local Product Exchange Conferences
    Editor: Currently, the autumn harvest in North China is nearing completion. In order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and vigorously promote local products, the government will use the slack farming season to organize local product exchange conferences in various places. During the conferences, many people will surely attend. I believe this is a good opportunity to conduct propaganda and education work among farmers. I remember that the various propaganda efforts carried out during the local product exchange conference in Wendeng County this spring achieved certain results. For example, the local farm promoted methods for eliminating pests and diseases, as well as the sowing, retting, washing, and grading of kenaf, which was well received by the masses. Some farmers said, "Coming to the conference not only allows us to buy inexpensive goods but also learn good farming knowledge. It's really killing two birds with one stone." Previously, some people in the area regarded pests as "divine insects" and dared not catch them. However, after the conference's propaganda, the farmers changed their past mistaken views. Around June 15th this year, when Wendeng, Rongcheng, and Kunyu counties suffered insect plagues, the farmers actively adopted effective methods to catch and kill them, preventing crop reduction due to pests. In addition, the Special Commissioner's Office Public Security Bureau and the People's Court also conducted propaganda on suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the new Marriage Law at the conference, which raised the masses' awareness and achieved certain results. Therefore, I suggest that relevant propaganda departments seize the opportunity of local product exchange conferences to vigorously conduct propaganda among the masses. Based on the experience of this spring, the following should be noted during propaganda: Careful and full preparation of propaganda materials should be made in advance, the content should be closely related to the current situation, the wording should be easy for the masses to understand, and more serial pictures of typical facts should be made. The comrades in charge of propaganda should patiently explain and publicize to the masses; propaganda sheds should be scattered in all corners of the conference, not concentrated in one place.

### 各地召开土产交流大会期间应向群众进行宣传教育工作

    各地召开土产交流大会期间应向群众进行宣传教育工作
    编辑同志：目前华北秋收已近结束，政府为了促进城乡物资交流，大力推销土产，将利用农闲时期，在各地筹开土产交流大会。在大会期间，赶会的人一定会很多，我认为这正是向农民进行宣传教育工作的好机会。记得今春在文登县土产交流大会上所进行的各项宣传工作，就取得了一定成绩。如该地农场在大会上向农民宣传消除病虫害和洋麻的播种、沤洗、分级等方法，获得群众好评。有的农民说：“来赶会买了贱东西，还学得了做庄稼的好知识，真是一举两得。”以前该地有部分群众，把害虫当成“神虫”，不敢捕捉。但经过大会的宣传，农民便改变了过去的错误看法。今年六月十五日前后，文登、荣成、昆嵛三县发生虫灾时，农民便都积极地采取了有效方法进行捕打，使庄稼没有因虫害而减产。此外，专署公安处和人民法院也都在会上作了关于镇压反革命和新婚姻法的宣传，提高了群众的觉悟，收到一定的效果。因此，我建议各有关宣传部门抓紧利用土产交流大会的机会，大力向群众进行宣传。根据今年春天的经验，在宣传时应当注意：要事先对宣传材料作细致和充分的准备，内容要切合当前实际，词句力求让群众都能听懂，多制一些典型事实的连环图画。担任宣传员的同志，要耐心地向群众讲解和宣传；宣传棚要分散在大会各个角落，不要集中在一个地方。
