Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The ideological remolding study movement for teachers in Beijing and Tianjin higher education institutions, under the leadership of the Learning Committee for Teachers in Beijing and Tianjin Higher Education Institutions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, has achieved initial success in the past month. The number of teachers participating in the study has increased from over three thousand to six thousand one hundred and eighty-eight. Staff members of some schools have also joined the study.

At the beginning of the study, some teachers lacked a clear understanding of the significance and purpose of the study. Some teachers believed that teaching was "noble" and did not require remolding; a few teachers believed that ideological remolding was a long-term process, and this study could not solve the problem. In response to the above-mentioned ideological situation, the learning committees of various schools carried out further mobilization and enlightenment, and the heads of many schools took the lead in participating in the study. For example, Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Tsinghua University, Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University, Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, Sun Xiaocun, President of Beijing Agricultural University, and Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University, all conducted self-criticism at the study discussion meetings. Their exemplary actions greatly promoted the study of teachers in various schools and the展开 development of criticism and self-criticism. After initially recognizing the purpose of the study and correcting their study attitude, the teachers of various schools began to study Premier Zhou's report on the remolding of intellectuals on September 29. The focus of the study was on discussing issues such as standpoint, attitude, and serving whom, and conducting criticism and self-criticism in connection with ideology, teaching attitude, and teaching methods. In the process of study, everyone exposed many confused thoughts in the past. Some had a vague standpoint and could not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. Some teachers had pro-American thoughts, feudal thoughts, and a strong sense of individualism. Teachers in colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, in particular, seriously held purely technical viewpoints that transcended class and politics, believing that science could transcend politics. Some people also believed that reformism had a certain "progressiveness." In the study, most teachers conducted self-criticism of their past erroneous thoughts, but generally teachers were hesitant to criticize others, feeling that it would "harm their feelings"; therefore, not many could conduct mutual criticism based on political principles. In order to better connect with reality to examine and criticize these thoughts, some schools criticized the erroneous thoughts of representative figures closely related to the school, which greatly improved their understanding of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves and of the reactionary essence of reformism. The faculties of Arts and Law of Peking University have begun to discuss their views on Hu Shih. Teachers and doctors of Peking University Medical College and its affiliated hospitals, combined with their work attitude and style, conducted discussions, corrected the objectivist views of many teachers and doctors, strengthened the idea of serving the people, and improved some unreasonable work systems in the affiliated hospitals. Some schools have also launched discussions on specific issues such as reforming the school system, curriculum, and teaching methods, as well as adjusting departments, which makes the ideological remolding study more in line with the purpose of reforming education. In terms of learning methods, the mutual aid groups and heart-to-heart talks of the Chemistry Department of Peking University have been adopted by many schools. In order to timely summarize and exchange experiences, the Academic Committee of the Ministry of Education convened an enlarged joint meeting of the heads of the academic committees and some teachers of higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin on November 2. At the meeting, the heads of the academic committees of Tsinghua University and Peking University made typical reports, and Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Education, gave instructions on learning issues. The academic committees of various schools have conveyed the report of the conference to the teachers, and have formulated methods to improve learning based on specific circumstances.

Students in Beijing and Tianjin higher education institutions have expressed great concern and excitement about the ideological remolding study of teachers. Students in many schools have put forward their opinions and hopes to the teachers, helping them to reflect and criticize. Students of Beijing Normal University expressed warm welcome to the progress made by the teachers of the school in their studies. They also used radio and wall newspapers to carry out publicity and mobilization work.

　　开始联系实际检查和批判错误思想
    京津高等学校教师学习初见成绩
    教育部学委会举行会议及时交流经验
    【新华社十二日讯】北京、天津高等学校教师思想改造学习运动，一个月来在中央人民政府教育部京津高等学校教师学习委员会领导下，已经有了初步的成绩。参加学习的教师已从三千多人增加到六千一百八十八人。部分学校的职员也参加了学习。
    在学习开始时，部分教师对学习的意义和目的缺乏明确的认识。有的教师认为教书“清高”，不需要改造；个别教师认为思想改造要经过长期过程，这次学习不能解决问题。针对上述思想情况，各校的学习委员会又进行了动员和启发，许多学校的负责人以身作则，带头参加学习。如北京大学校长马寅初、清华大学教务长周培源、燕京大学校长陆志韦、辅仁大学校长陈垣、北京农业大学校长孙晓邨、津沽大学校长张国藩等都在学习讨论会上进行了自我检讨。他们的示范行动，对各校教师的学习和展开批评和自我批评起了很大的推动作用。在初步认清了学习目的和端正了学习态度后，各校教师开始学习周总理在九月二十九日所作的关于知识分子改造问题的报告。学习重点是讨论立场问题、态度问题和为谁服务等问题，联系思想和教学态度、教学方法，进行批评和自我批评。在学习过程中，大家暴露了过去很多糊涂思想。有的立场模糊，敌我界限不分。有的教师则存在着崇美思想、封建思想和浓厚的个人主义思想。各校理、工、农、医等学院的教师，尤其严重地存在着超阶级超政治的单纯技术观点，认为科学可以超越政治。还有些人认为改良主义有一定的“进步性”。在学习中大部分教师对自己过去的错误思想进行了自我批评，但一般教师对批评别人有顾虑，觉得“有碍情面”；因此，能从政治原则上进行互相批评的不多。为了更好地联系实际检查批判这些思想，有的学校对与本校关系密切的代表性人物的错误思想进行了批判，大大地提高了他们对分清敌我界限和对改良主义反动本质的认识。北京大学文、法两学院已开始讨论对胡适的看法。北京大学医学院及其附属医院的教师和医生，结合他们的工作态度和工作作风，进行讨论，纠正了许多教师和医生的客观主义观点，加强了为人民服务的思想，并改进了附属医院某些不合理的工作制度。有些学校并对改革学制、课程和教学方法以及院系调整等具体问题，展开了讨论，这样就使思想改造学习更能符合改革教育的目的。在学习方法上，北京大学化学系的互助组和谈心等办法，已为许多学校采用。教育部学委会为了及时总结和交流经验，在十一月二日曾召集北京、天津各高等学校学委分会负责人及部分教师举行扩大联席会议。会上，清华大学和北京大学学委分会负责人作了典型报告，教育部副部长钱俊瑞作了有关学习问题的指示。各校学委分会已向教师们传达了大会的报告，并根据具体情况规定了改进学习的办法。
    北京、天津高等学校的学生对教师们的思想改造学习表示极大的关怀和兴奋。许多学校的学生都向教师提出了他们的意见和希望，帮助教师们反省和批判。北京师范大学的学生对该校教师们在学习中的进步表示热烈的欢迎。他们并利用广播和墙报等进行宣传鼓动工作。
