    Learn from the Struggle Experience and Noble Qualities of the Soviet People
    "Soviet Film Exhibition" Opens in the Capital Yesterday
    National Exhibition to Be Held Simultaneously in Twenty Major Cities Starting Tomorrow
    [Xinhua News Agency, November 5th] The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation, affiliated with the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, held a grand opening ceremony for the "Soviet Film Exhibition" in the capital last night to celebrate the 34th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution.
    Among those who attended the opening ceremony were Wu Yuzhang, Shen Junru, and Li Jishen, vice presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Ma Xulun, deputy director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government; Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of Culture; Yuan Muzhi, Director of the Film Bureau; Yang Hansheng, Chairman of the All-China Film Art Workers Association; Stalin Prize winners Zhou Libo, Xu Xiaobing, and He Shide; cultural and artistic figures from the capital including Ding Ling, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Shakov, Ai Qing, Mei Lanfang, Li Bozhao, and other people from all walks of life, totaling more than one thousand. Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, as well as representatives from the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in China and the Soviet Film Export Corporation in China, were invited to attend. Diplomats and diplomatic personnel from various countries stationed in China were also invited.
    The opening ceremony was presided over by Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of Culture. In his opening remarks, Zhou Yang said: Soviet films are highly artistic, ideological, and militant films in the world. The Chinese people love Soviet films very much. Over the past two years, Soviet films have been translated, eliminating language barriers, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of viewers. The noble communist ideals and advanced experiences in socialist construction shown in Soviet films, as well as the various heroic figures and heroic deeds appearing in the films, have greatly strengthened the confidence and strength of the Chinese people in building a New China and defending world peace. The broad masses of viewers have abandoned reactionary, decadent, and corrupt American films, and regard Soviet films as their guide to action. Young Chinese films follow the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao and have learned a lot of experience from Soviet films. Through this exhibition, the Chinese people will learn more from Soviet films about the struggle experiences and noble qualities of the Soviet people.
    Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council, said in his speech: Soviet films allow us to see the happiness and future of mankind. They serve the cause of lasting peace for the whole world. In the past two or three years, we have regarded translating Soviet films as an important task in our cultural work. In the future, we will introduce more Soviet films to China. Through such work, we will strengthen the closer unity, friendship, and mutual assistance between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and further strengthen Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges.
    Soviet Ambassador Roshchin was invited to speak. In his speech, he introduced the content of the films that will be exhibited. He said: These films have a common characteristic, that is, they represent the art of socialist realism, represent truly democratic and people's art, they expose the conspiracies of war-mongers and call on the people of the world to fight for peace. Soviet films have played a great role in cultivating the new communist morality of the Soviet people. He said: In the first half of October, the Soviet Union held a ten-day "Chinese Film Exhibition" in which films such as "The White-Haired Girl" and "Steel Fighter" received high praise from the Soviet people. Now China is holding a "Soviet Film Exhibition," which is not accidental. This proves that the cultural cooperation between our two peoples has a tradition and has become a mass undertaking. This is a great contribution to consolidating the cultural cooperation and friendship between the two great peoples.
    After the opening ceremony, the Soviet color films "Father of Russian Aviation" and "Soviet Grand Circus" were shown.
    [Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd] The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation, in celebration of the 34th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, will hold the "Soviet Film Exhibition" simultaneously in twenty major cities across the country starting on the 7th of this month.

    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府文化部电影局所属中国影片经理公司，为庆祝苏联十月社会主义革命三十四周年举办的“苏联影片展览”，五日晚在首都隆重开幕。
    参加开幕典礼的有中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章、沈钧儒、李济深，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦、文化部副部长周扬、电影局局长袁牧之、中华全国电影艺术工作者协会主席阳翰笙，斯大林奖金获得者周立波、徐肖冰、何士德，首都文化艺术界人士丁玲、田汉、洪深、沙可夫、艾青、梅兰芳、李伯钊等以及各界人士一千余人。苏联驻我国大使罗申以及苏联对外文化协会驻中国代表、苏联影片输出公司驻中国代表均应邀参加。应邀参加的尚有各国驻我国使节和外交人员。
    开幕典礼由文化部副部长周扬主持。周扬在开幕词中说：苏联电影是世界上具有高度的艺术性、思想性和战斗性的电影，中国人民十分热爱苏联电影。两年以来，苏联影片经过译制，消除了语言的隔阂，在广大观众中受到日益热烈的欢迎。苏联影片所表现的共产主义的高尚思想和社会主义建设的先进经验，影片中出现的各种英雄人物英雄事迹，大大增强了中国人民建设新中国和保卫世界和平的信心和力量。广大观众已经唾弃了反动的堕落的腐朽的美国电影，而把苏联电影当作自己行动的指南。年青的中国电影遵循着毛主席指示的文艺方向，从苏联电影中学习了很多的经验。通过这次展览，中国人民将更多地从苏联电影中学习苏维埃人民的斗争经验和高尚品质。
    政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦在讲话中说：苏联电影使我们看见了人类的幸福和未来，它是为全世界持久和平服务的。两三年来，我们曾经把译制苏联影片当作我们文化工作中的一件重要工作；今后我们还要介绍更多的苏联影片到中国来。我们要通过这样的工作，加强中苏两国人民更亲密的团结、友好、互助，更进一步地加强中苏文化的交流。
    苏联大使罗申应邀讲话。他在讲话中介绍了将要展览的影片的内容。他说：这些影片有一个共同的特点，就是它们代表着社会主义现实主义的艺术，代表真正民主的和人民的艺术，它们揭露了战争贩子的阴谋并号召全世界人民为和平而斗争。在培养苏联人民的共产主义新道德中，苏联电影是起了很大的作用的。他说：十月上半月，苏联举行了十天的“中国电影展览”中的“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”等影片，获得了苏联人民高度的评价。现在中国又举行“苏联影片展览”，这不是偶然的，这证明我们两国人民的文化合作是有传统的，而且成为群众性的事业。这对于巩固两国伟大人民之间的文化合作和友好事业上是一件很大的贡献。
    开幕典礼后，放映苏联彩色影片“俄罗斯航空之父”和“苏联大马戏团”。
