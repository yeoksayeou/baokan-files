    The U.S. government's crimes of plotting aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are becoming increasingly shameless and blatant. In the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," signed by U.S. President Truman on October 10 of this year, it is openly stipulated that funds be allocated to subsidize reactionary elements to engage in subversive and destructive activities in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and to organize armed groups to oppose the aforementioned countries.
    Regarding this sinister plot, the Soviet government has lodged a firm protest with the U.S. government; at the same time, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, Vyshinsky, has also submitted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting that this urgent issue be included in the agenda of the General Assembly. The Soviet government's protest and Vyshinsky's proposal to the United Nations have powerfully exposed and struck at the U.S.'s aggressive schemes. The Soviet Union's protest and the proposal to the United Nations will surely receive the full support of peace-loving people all over the world.
    Since World War II, the U.S. government has continuously engaged in subversive and destructive activities against the People's Democracies. The Rajk treason case, announced by the Hungarian government in September 1949, and the Kostov treason case, announced by the Bulgarian government in December 1949, were both organized behind the scenes by the U.S. government and its spy agencies. There have also been several cases of armed riots and sabotage activities carried out by U.S. imperialist secret agents within the territory of our People's Republic of China that have been exposed. These ironclad facts repeatedly prove that the U.S. government has consistently attempted to interfere with and sabotage the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies through conspiratorial means. The so-called "Mutual Security Act" signed by Truman on October 10 of this year is not only another exposure of the U.S. government's ambition, but also a public declaration of its most shameless and most arrogant plan of aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.
    At a time when the U.S. government is stepping up its war preparations, this open and blatant plan against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is undoubtedly closely related to its war plans. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world must not tolerate this outrageous and peace-disrupting heinous crime of the U.S. government. Peace-loving people of the world must act together to resolutely oppose the U.S. government's "Mutual Security Act" and stop the increasingly frantic aggression and shameless sabotage of the U.S. bandits.

    美国政府的无耻侵略行为
    美国政府阴谋侵略苏联和各人民民主国家的罪行越来越无耻而露骨了。美国总统杜鲁门于本年十月十日所签署的“一九五一年共同安全法”中，竟公然明文规定拨款资助反动分子，在苏联及人民民主国家从事颠覆和破坏活动，并组织武装集团以反对上述各国。
    对于这个罪恶的阴谋，苏联政府已照会美国政府提出坚决抗议；同时，苏联出席联合国代表团团长维辛斯基也已向联合国大会提出建议，要求把这一迫切问题列入大会议程。苏联政府的抗议和维辛斯基对联合国的建议，有力地揭穿并打击了美国的侵略图谋。苏联的抗议和对联合国的建议必然会受到全世界爱好和平人民的全力支持。
    美国政府在第二次世界大战以来，即对人民民主国家不断从事颠覆破坏活动。一九四九年九月匈牙利政府所公布的拉伊克叛国案及一九四九年十二月保加利亚政府所公布的科斯托夫叛国案，就都是美国政府和它的间谍机关在幕后组织的。美国帝国主义的特务间谍在我中华人民共和国境内所进行的武装暴乱和破坏活动的案件，也有好几起被揭穿了。这些铁的事实一再证明着：美国政府一贯企图以阴谋手段来干涉和破坏苏联及人民民主国家。杜鲁门本年十月十日所签署的所谓“共同安全法”则不但是又一次暴露了美国政府的这种野心，而且是公然宣布了它对苏联和人民民主国家最无耻和最狂妄的侵略计划。
    在美国政府正加紧其备战活动的时候，它的这一公开露骨的反对苏联和人民民主国家的计划，无疑是与它的战争计划有着密切关系的。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民决不能容忍美国政府的这种粗暴的、破坏和平的滔天罪行。世界爱好和平人民必须共同行动起来，坚决反对美国政府的“共同安全法”，制止美国的强盗日益疯狂的侵略和无耻的破坏行为。
