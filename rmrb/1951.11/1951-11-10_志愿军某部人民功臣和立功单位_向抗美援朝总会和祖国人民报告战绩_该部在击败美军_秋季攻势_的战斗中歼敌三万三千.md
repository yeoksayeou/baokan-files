Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th: In the battle to defeat the US invading army's Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army produced over a thousand People's Meritorious Servants and Units of Merit. At the celebration meeting recently held by the unit, these People's Meritorious Servants and Units of Merit sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and the people of the whole country, reporting their battle achievements and expressing their determination to fight to the end for a fair and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue. The telegram said: We are very excited to report to you that the first and second phases of Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive" have been met with extremely heavy blows from us. From August 31st to October 10th, our unit alone eliminated more than 8,000 enemy troops, of which more than 3,000 were American soldiers, shot down and damaged more than 20 enemy planes, and damaged more than 30 enemy tanks. From October 13th to 17th, in five days and nights of fierce fighting, we annihilated more than 25,000 enemy troops and damaged 21 enemy tanks, beating the American invading army until their heads were bloodied and they could not advance an inch.

In the battle, our unit produced over a thousand People's Meritorious Servants and Units of Merit. Among them was the 8th Company of a certain unit, which was awarded a collective first-class merit. In a critical situation, they fought alone, repelling the enemy's repeated attacks by a regiment under the cover of more than 20 tanks and eight planes, killing and wounding more than 300 enemies, and the position remained unmoved. The calm and resourceful Chen Wanzhen group of three people repelled the invasion of more than 300 enemies, killing and wounding 70 enemies, while themselves suffering no casualties. The 5th Company of the artillery regiment created an outstanding battle example of destroying six enemy tanks with 18 shells. Youth League member Yan Jie destroyed an enemy tank alone, and after being wounded, he persisted in fighting and killed an enemy tank driver. Anti-aircraft gunners Zhang Baoshan and Shi Zhongxiang shot down an enemy plane with three shells.

The telegram concluded: After a year of practical training, our tactical skills have been universally improved. Encouraged by the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement of the people of the motherland, our patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism have been more universally developed in the troops. We have the confidence and strength to defeat any attack that the American imperialist aggressors dare to launch. We assure the people of the motherland that as long as American imperialism does not give up its aggressive ambitions for a single day, we will always stand on the front line of the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle, give the aggressors even heavier blows, and fight to the end to defend the motherland and defend peace.

    向抗美援朝总会和祖国人民报告战绩
    该部在击败美军“秋季攻势”的战斗中歼敌三万三千
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】中国人民志愿军某部在击败美国侵略军范佛里特“秋季攻势”的战斗中，涌现出一千多个人民功臣和立功单位。这些人民功臣和立功单位在该部最近举行的庆功大会上，致电中国人民抗美援朝总会和全国人民，报告他们的战绩，并表示决心为争取朝鲜问题公平合理的解决而斗争到底。电文说：我们十分兴奋地向你们报告：范佛里特“秋季攻势”的第一、二回合，已经遭到我们极其惨重的打击。从八月三十一日到十月十日，单我们这一部队就消灭了敌军八千多名，其中美军占三千多名，击落、击伤敌机二十多架，击伤敌坦克三十多辆。从十月十三日到十七日，在五昼夜的激战中，我们又歼敌二万五千多名，击伤敌坦克二十一辆，打得美国侵略军头破血流，寸步难进。
    在战斗中，我们部队涌现出一千多个人民功臣和立功单位。其中有集体立一等功的某部第八连，他们在一次危急情况中孤军奋战，打退敌人一个团在二十多辆坦克和八架飞机掩护下的轮番进攻，杀伤了三百多个敌人，阵地屹立未动。沉着、机智的陈万桢小组三个人打退了三百多敌人的进犯，杀伤敌人七十名，而自己无一伤亡。炮兵团第五连创造了用十八发炮弹击毁了敌人六辆坦克的杰出战例。青年团员阎杰独自炸毁敌坦克一辆，负伤后仍坚持战斗，又打死了敌坦克手。高射炮手张宝山和石忠祥用三发炮弹，打落了敌机一架。
    电文最后说：经过一年来的实战锻炼，我们的战术技术已经普遍提高了。在祖国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动的鼓舞下，我们的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义精神已更普遍地在部队里发扬起来。我们有信心有力量击败美帝国主义侵略者所敢于发动的任何进攻。我们向祖国人民保证：美帝国主义一天收不起它的侵略野心，我们便永远站在抗美援朝斗争的最前线，给侵略者以更加沉重的打击，为保卫祖国、保卫和平而战斗到底。
