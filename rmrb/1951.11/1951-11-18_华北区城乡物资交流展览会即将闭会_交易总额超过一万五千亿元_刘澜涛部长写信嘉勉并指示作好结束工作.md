　  North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition to Close Soon

    Minister Liu Lantao Writes Letter of Commendation and Instructs on Completion of Work
[Reported by this newspaper] The North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition has achieved great success. The exhibition's trading will conclude today, and the conference has decided to close on November 20th as planned.

    Thanks to the correct leadership of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government and the efforts of all staff, the conference has achieved brilliant results in all aspects during the 45 days since its opening. Trading will officially cease on November 18th. The current transaction volume has exceeded 1.5 trillion yuan. The number of visitors has reached over 700,000, including over 10,000 farmer representatives from the five provinces of North China and Inner Mongolia. The conference has been unanimously praised by visitors. In many letters from viewers, it was unanimously said that the conference was rich in content, with clear policies, fully embodying the vastness and abundance of the motherland, and educating workers and agricultural producers to further understand the various economic policies of New Democracy.

    On November 11th, Minister Liu Lantao of the North China Affairs Department once again wrote a letter to commend all cadres, and gave instructions on completing the closing work:

    (1) We should earnestly summarize the rich experiences of the conference in site construction, exhibit collection, liaison and reception, publicity and education, and material exchange. We should systematically summarize the experiences in industrial and commercial improvement, agricultural bumper harvests, overcoming disasters, and various creations and inventions; and carefully organize these materials to compile them into volumes, distribute them to various places, and guide future work.

    (2) This exhibition vividly and powerfully demonstrated the great creativity and strong leadership of the working class. In the future, we should comprehensively and on a large scale launch mass movements to increase production and practice strict economy on the existing basis, tap the potential of existing production equipment, improve business management, and increase national wealth to support the complete victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and to welcome the upcoming large-scale industrial construction.

    We must plan, lead, and organize farmer representatives who came to Tianjin to visit, to enshrine the valuable experiences they learned at the conference in the 1952 patriotic bumper harvest covenants. We will transform the bumper harvest achievements of a few model laborers into a bumper harvest movement for the vast number of farmers, to welcome the high tide of the patriotic bumper harvest movement in the entire North China region next year.

    (3) Through summarizing the work, further improve the ideological and policy level of all staff members of the conference, so that they can do their work better after returning to their original posts.

    (4) Signing a transaction contract is only the first step in the transaction. Therefore, we hope that all transacting units will strictly abide by contract credit and ensure its implementation.

    (5) In accordance with the principle of "taking from the conference and using it for the conference," strive for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure.

    On November 14th, under the chairmanship of Deputy Directors Li Zheren and Li Gengtao, the conference convened a plenary meeting of all committee members, and specifically discussed and arranged the closing work of the conference based on the instructions of Minister Liu Lantao.

　  华北区城乡物资交流展览会即将闭会
    交易总额超过一万五千亿元
    刘澜涛部长写信嘉勉并指示作好结束工作 【本报讯】华北区城乡物资交流展览会成绩巨大。展览会交易今日结束，大会已决定按照预定计划于十一月二十日闭会。
    此次大会，由于中央人民政府华北事务部的正确领导和全体工作人员的努力，开幕四十五天以来，各方面已获得辉煌成绩。交易即于十一月十八日正式停止。目前成交额已超过一万五千亿元。参观人数已达七十余万，内有华北五省和内蒙等地的农民代表一万余人。大会获得参观者一致好评。在许多观众的来信中，一致说大会内容丰富、政策明确，充分体现了祖国地大物博，并教育工农生产者进一步认识了新民主主义的各项经济政策。
    十一月十一日，华北事务部刘澜涛部长再次来信嘉勉全体干部，并对作好结束工作作了指示：
    （一）应认真总结大会在场地建设、展品征集、联络招待、宣传教育和物资交流等项工作中的丰富经验。对工商改进、农业丰产、战胜灾害和各种创造发明的经验，更应有系统地加以总结；并将这些材料精密地加以整理，以便汇集成册，发行各地，指导今后的工作。
    （二）在这个展览会中，生动有力地表现出了工人阶级的伟大创造性和坚强的领导力量。今后应在现有基础上，全面地大规模地开展增加生产、厉行节约的群众运动，发挥现有生产设备的潜在能力，改进经营管理，增加国家财富，以支援抗美援朝的完全胜利，迎接即将到来的大规模的工业建设。
    要有计划地领导和组织来天津参观的农民代表，将他们在大会上所学到的宝贵经验订立在一九五二年的爱国丰产公约中去。使少数劳动模范的丰产成绩发展成为广大农民的丰产运动，以迎接明年华北全区爱国丰产运动的高潮。
    （三）经过总结工作，进一步提高大会全体工作人员的思想、政策水平，以便他们回到原来工作岗位后，都能把工作做得更好。
    （四）签订了交易合同，只是成交的第一步。因此，希望各成交单位，都能严格遵守合同信用，并保证其贯彻实现。
    （五）本着“取之于会用之于会”的方针，力争财政收支平衡。
    十一月十四日，在李哲人、李耕涛副主任主持下，大会召开了全体委员会议，根据刘澜涛部长的指示具体讨论和布置了大会的结束工作。
