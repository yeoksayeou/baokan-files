    Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Congratulatory Telegram to Marshal Stalin:
    On the joyous occasion of the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we extend to you and all the working people of the Soviet Union our warmest congratulations and most respectful greetings!
    The success of the October Revolution was the clarion call for the liberation of all oppressed and enslaved people of the world, and a major turning point in human history. Due to the inspiring success of the October Revolution, and the great assistance of the Soviet government and people, the Chinese people have achieved today's brilliant victory!
    The Chinese people will never forget the help of the Soviet people. We must follow the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and unite closely with the Soviet people to fight for the defense of lasting world peace, for the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and for the liberation of our sacred territory – Taiwan!
    Let us shout: Long live the fortress of the world peace and democracy camp, the Soviet Union! Long live the Sino-Soviet friendship and unity! Long live Marshal Stalin!
