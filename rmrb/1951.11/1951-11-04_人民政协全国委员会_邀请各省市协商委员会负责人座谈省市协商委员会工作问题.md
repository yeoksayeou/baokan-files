Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd—The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference invited the responsible persons of the provincial and municipal consultative committees attending the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd to discuss the work issues of the provincial and municipal consultative committees. The meeting was presided over by Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen and Chen Shutong. At the meeting, the responsible persons of the provincial and municipal consultative committees enthusiastically expressed their opinions on continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, promoting the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, promoting the ideological remolding movement, and the systematic study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible persons of the provincial and municipal consultative committees unanimously agreed that the above three tasks should be the central work of the local consultative organs. The local consultative committees should promote and carry out these tasks through the democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democratic personages, and transform the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the movement to increase production and practice economy into mass movements. Finally, Li Weihan, Secretary-General of the National Committee, delivered a speech, in which he put forward many positive opinions on how the local consultative committees should promote the above three tasks.
