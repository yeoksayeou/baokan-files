Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 13th: The Qinghai Province Yushu Special District Tibetan People's Regional Autonomy Preparatory Committee, representing the Tibetan people of the district, wrote a letter on the 8th of this month to the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan local government, and all Tibetan compatriots, congratulating Tibet on its peaceful liberation and reporting on their happy lives under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the past two years. The letter stated: We, the Tibetan people of Yushu Special District, were extremely happy to see the Dalai Buddha's telegram to Chairman Mao on the 24th of last month. From now on, all Tibetan compatriots, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China, will forever live a free and happy life.

　　Before liberation, the Tibetan people of Yushu Special District suffered brutal massacres and plunder by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, our monasteries were protected by the People's Government, and our customs and religious beliefs were also respected. The Qianbai households are also managing agricultural and pastoral areas as usual under the leadership of the People's Government. Medical teams and trade teams organized by the People's Government frequently visit the earthen houses and tents of various tribes to provide medical treatment and supply us, the Tibetan people, with necessities. Last winter, the Yushu Special District People's Administrative Commissioner's Office also helped us organize more than 30,000 yaks to carry wool and hides to Xining to sell, exchanging them for a large amount of grain and daily necessities. The price of every hundred catties of wool has increased from three silver dollars before liberation to fifty silver dollars. Therefore, in the two years since liberation, our lives have improved significantly.

　　Before liberation, the Kuomintang bandit gang, in order to achieve their goal of ruling us, used various despicable means to divide the unity between our various tribes. After liberation, the People's Governments at all levels, based on the national policy of ethnic equality, unity, and friendship, patiently helped us mediate disputes, enabling us to recognize the crimes of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs. Now, there are very few incidents of disputes over grasslands and robberies here, and the people of the entire special district are as united as a family.

　　In the past two years, the People's Government has actively helped us train a large number of Tibetan cadres, and many Tibetans have participated in the work of People's Governments at all levels. Soon, we will establish our own regional autonomous government of the Tibetan people, and under the leadership of the superior People's Government, we will manage our own affairs. This is a great happy event that has never happened in thousands of years. Now, we are welcoming the establishment of the regional autonomous regime with the most joyful mood. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and resolutely build our autonomous region under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.

　　Finally, we warmly hope that the Dalai Buddha, the Tibetan local government, and all Tibetan compatriots, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, and under the protection of the People's Liberation Army, will strive to thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, consolidate the western border defense of the motherland, and build a prosperous and affluent new Tibet.

　　青海省玉树专区藏族人民区域自治筹备委员会
    写信给达赖喇嘛祝贺西藏和平解放 【新华社西宁十三日电】青海省玉树专区藏族人民区域自治筹备委员会代表该区藏族人民在本月八日写信给达赖喇嘛、西藏地方政府和全藏同胞，祝贺西藏获得和平解放，并报告他们两年来在共产党、人民政府领导下过着幸福生活的情形。信中说：我们玉树专区的藏族人民看到达赖佛在上月二十四日致毛主席的电文后，高兴极了。从此，全藏同胞在中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，将永远过着自由幸福的生活。
    玉树专区的藏族人民，在解放前曾受尽了国民党反动派的残酷屠杀和掠夺。解放后，我们的寺院受到人民政府的保护，我们的风俗习惯和宗教信仰也受到尊重。千百户也在人民政府的领导下照常管理着农牧地区的事情。人民政府组织的医疗队和贸易队，经常来到各部落的土房和帐房，给我们藏族人民巡回医治疾病和供给我们生活必需品。去年冬天，玉树专区人民行政专员公署又帮助我们组织了三万多头毛牛，驮着羊毛、牛皮到西宁去卖，换回大批的粮食和日用品。每百斤羊毛的价格已由解放前的三块银洋提高到五十块银洋。因此，解放后两年来，我们的生活已有了显著的改善。
    解放前，国民党匪帮为了达到统治我们的目的，曾采用了各种卑鄙的手段来分裂我们各部落之间的团结，解放后，各级人民政府依据民族平等、团结友爱的民族政策，耐心地帮助我们调解了纠纷，使我们认清了蒋、马匪帮的罪恶。现在我们这里很少有争夺草山和抢劫的事件发生了，全专区的人民已团结得像一家人一样。
    两年来，人民政府积极帮助我们培养和训练了大批的藏族干部，已有许多藏民参加了各级人民政府的工作。不久，我们将要建立藏族人民自己的区域自治政府，在上级人民政府领导下，自己管理自己的事情，这是几千年来没有过的大喜事。现在，我们正怀着最愉快的心情，来迎接区域自治政权的建立，我们要永远跟着毛主席走，坚决在毛主席的英明领导下，建设自己的自治区。
    最后我们热烈地希望达赖佛、西藏地方政府和全藏同胞在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在人民解放军的捍卫下，为彻底实现和平解放西藏的协议、巩固祖国西部边防和建设繁荣富足的新西藏而奋斗。
