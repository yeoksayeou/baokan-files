Editor's Note: The Bulgarian People's Delegation to the National Day Observances, invited to participate in our National Day celebration, issued a written statement to bid farewell to our people on the eve of their departure from Beijing. Below is the full text of the written statement.

During our month-long stay in China as the Bulgarian delegation, the Chinese government and mass organizations provided us with comradely sincere care and thoughtful arrangements, enabling us to visit many cities and villages in China, attend mass rallies and various meetings, and meet and talk with workers, laboring farmers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, university students, and primary and secondary school students. Wherever we went, what we witnessed convinced us that the Chinese people have made tremendous progress materially and culturally. Everywhere we saw the creativity and joyful enthusiasm displayed by the masses of the people, everywhere we saw the Chinese people filled with firm confidence. They believe that under the leadership of the battle-tested and victorious Chinese Communist Party, led by the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong, China's economic and cultural development will become increasingly rapid and increasingly significant.

On the beautiful land of China, we have seen from our own observations and conversations that the laboring people of all strata, liberated from the shackles of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism, are eager for knowledge. The Chinese people's regime is making every effort to enable the laboring people to have every opportunity to study culture and receive science and art. Inspired by the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the thoughts of their wise leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese laboring masses are advancing by leaps and bounds along the bright road.

We have seen the farmers who have gained happiness due to land reform, and we have talked with them, they have obtained land, farm tools, and houses without cost. We have talked with the enthusiastic young soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, all of whom wear medals and decorations on their chests for their heroic fighting. We have also witnessed with our own eyes young men and women rushing to the Korean front with righteous indignation against American imperialism, to fight for the freedom of the Korean people and for world peace. We have never doubted that the American imperialists will inevitably fail in Korea; however, in China, we have come to realize even more that their failure is imminent.

We express our sincere gratitude to the Chinese People's Government for its cordial and fraternal hospitality. We believe it is necessary to emphasize that we will tell our people about the rapidly achieved historically significant achievements and victories of the Chinese people, thereby helping to further strengthen the Bulgarian people's struggle to defend world peace.

    我们到处看到中国人民充满坚定信心
    保加利亚人民观礼代表团返国前夕向我国人民告别
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节庆祝典礼的保加利亚人民观礼代表团离京返国前夕，发表书面谈话，向我国人民告别。下面是书面谈话的全文。
    我们保加利亚代表团在中国逗留了一个月。中国政府和群众团体给予我们同志般的诚挚关怀和周到的照顾，使我们能够访问中国许多城市和乡村，出席群众集会和各种会议，能与工人、劳动农民、解放军战士、中国人民志愿军战士、大学生和中小学生见面交谈。不论我们到过的什么地方，我们所亲眼见到的事物，都使我们相信中国人民在物质上和文化上已获得了巨大的进步。我们到处看到人民群众表现的创造性和欢欣鼓舞的情绪，到处看到中国人民充满着坚定的信心。他们相信在以中国人民领袖毛泽东为首的久经战斗和胜利考验的中国共产党领导下，中国经济和文化的发展将愈来愈迅速，愈来愈巨大。
    在美丽的中国土地上，我们从自己的观察和与人交谈中看出：从封建主义、资本主义和帝国主义的枷锁下解放出来的各阶层劳动人民是渴望知识的。中国人民政权正在竭力使劳动人民有一切可能来学习文化，接受科学和艺术。中国劳动群众在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说和自己英明的领袖毛泽东的思想鼓舞下，正在大踏步地沿着光明的大道迈进。
    我们看到了由于土地改革而获得幸福的农民，并曾和他们交谈，他们已不用代价获得了土地、农具和住宅。我们曾和热情的中国人民志愿军的青年战士们交谈，他们的胸前都佩着因英勇作战而获得的奖章和勋章。我们也亲眼看见了青年男女们怀着憎恨美帝国主义的义愤之心奔赴朝鲜前线，去为朝鲜人民的自由和世界和平而斗争。我们从来没有怀疑过，美帝国主义者在朝鲜必然失败；不过，我们在中国更体会到，他们的失败已指日可待了。
    我们对中国人民政府诚挚的兄弟般的招待深表感谢。我们认为必须着重说明：我们将对我国人民讲述中国人民迅速获得具有历史意义的成就和胜利的情形，从而帮助进一步加强保加利亚人民保卫世界和平的斗争。
