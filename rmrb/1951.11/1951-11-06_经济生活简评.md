Economic Life Brief Commentary

    In agricultural tax work, we must adhere to the principle of tax calculation according to the rate
    Currently, all parts of the country are arranging the autumn collection of agricultural tax. Many regions are following the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, focusing on discussing and implementing the principle of strict tax calculation according to the rate; the Southwest and Northwest regions, in order to prevent the bias of "fixed task, flexible tax rate," specifically prohibit governments at all levels from assigning "tasks" to townships and villages, to avoid the phenomenon of tax rates yielding to "tasks"; this is entirely correct. However, there are also individual regions and provinces that have not correctly implemented the principle of tax calculation according to the rate, and have even proposed the opposite principle. For example, the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding agricultural tax collection work, published in the Hubei Daily on September 1, advocated the implementation of a "fixed task allocation" method, and emphasized: "It is necessary to oppose those who do not see that the burden on the masses is already heavy enough, and attempt to seize the peasants' excess burden in the name of tax calculation according to the rate; this is wrong"; the editorial titled "To Complete the Autumn Collection Task, the First Task is to Solve the Ideological Problems of Cadres," published in the same newspaper on the same day, even listed "tax calculation according to the rate" as one of the cadres' erroneous thoughts, and opposed it. These statements are fundamentally wrong.
    The "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas," passed by the Ninth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on September 5 last year, clearly stipulated that governments at all levels must implement the principle of strict tax calculation according to the rate when collecting agricultural tax. Article 5 of the State Council's "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Work in 1951," issued on June 21 this year, reiterated the previous order, stipulating that "governments at all levels must strictly calculate and collect taxes in accordance with the tax rates approved by the State Council of the Central People's Government, and shall not freely increase or decrease them." Article 12 of the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Land Reform Areas in 1951 and Article 12 of the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Non-Land Reform Areas in 1951, promulgated by the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee on August 16, also have the same provisions. Tax laws and tax rates are formulated according to the needs of the country and the demands of the people, and are approved by the State Council of the Central People's Government. They come from the masses and go to the masses. Cadres of governments at all levels and the people of the whole country should act in accordance with the law and implement them. Of course, if some areas adopt the method of gradually promoting tax calculation according to the rate, taking into account the actual situation due to poor working conditions, that is permissible. However, this cannot be used as an excuse to deliberately postpone the implementation of tax calculation according to the rate in areas where land surveys and production determination could have been carried out; nor can one simply say that "the principle of tax calculation according to the rate proposed by the Central Government" is correct, but our region can only implement the "fixed task, flexible tax rate" method to resist the realization of the correct principle due to the heavy burden of other tasks; as for openly regarding the principle of tax calculation according to the rate as wrong, and saying that tax calculation according to the rate is "seizing the peasants' excess burden," that is even more wrong.
    People's governments at all levels and local Party committees at all levels of the Communist Party of China should study how to combine the local situation and implement the policies and guidelines of the Central People's Government. If there are opinions, they can be submitted to the higher-level Party committees and higher-level governments; but before the higher-level government has changed the established policy, the lower level has no right to issue instructions that contradict the regulations of the higher-level government. The instructions on agricultural tax work issued by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China are not only wrong in their arguments, but also a kind of unorganized and undisciplined behavior. It is hoped that the Hubei Provincial Committee will review and correct this.

    在农业税工作中，必须坚持依率计征的方针
    目前全国各地正在布置农业税秋季征收工作。许多地区均遵照中央人民政府政务院的指示，着重讨论并贯彻严格依率计征的方针；西南区和西北区为了防止“死任务活税率”的偏向，特别禁止各级政府对乡、村分配“任务”，以免发生以税率屈从“任务”的现象；这是完全正确的。但也有个别地区个别省份，没有正确贯彻依率计征的方针，甚至提出了相反的方针。例如，湖北日报九月一日刊载的中国共产党湖北省委员会关于农业税征收工作的指示，即主张实行“固定分配任务”办法，并强调提出：“必须反对那些看不见群众负担已经够重了，而希图借依率计征之口，夺取农民的超额负担，这是错误的”；该报于同日发表的题为“完成秋征任务，首先要解决干部思想问题”的社论，竟将“依率计征”列为干部错误思想之一，加以反对。这些说法，都是根本错误的。
    去年九月五日，中央人民政府委员会第九次会议通过的“新解放区农业税暂行条例”，明确规定各级人民政府在征收农业税时，必须执行严格依率计征的方针。今年六月二十一日政务院“关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示”第五条，又重申前令，规定“各级人民政府必须严格依照中央人民政府政务院核准的税率计征，不得自由增加或减少”。八月十六日，中南军政委员会公布的土地改革地区一九五一年农业税暂行条例第十二条和未土地改革地区一九五一年农业税暂行条例第十二条，亦均有同样规定。税法税率是根据国家需要和人民的要求制定的，是由中央人民政府政务院批准的，它是从群众中来又到群众中去的，全国各级人民政府的干部和全国人民，自应依法办事，贯彻执行。当然，如果某些地区由于工作条件太差，而采取照顾实际情况的逐步推行依率计征的办法，那是可以的。但不能因此而故意推迟本来可以查田定产依率计征的地区而不实行；也不能空口说“中央所提依率计征的方针”是正确的，但我区因其他任务繁重，只能施行“死任务活税率”的办法来抵抗正确方针的实现；至于公开把依率计征的方针看成是错误的，把依率计征说成是“夺取农民超额负担”则更是错误的。
    各级人民政府和中共各级地方党委，应当研究如何结合本地情况，贯彻中央人民政府的方针政策，如有意见，可向上级党委和上级政府提出；但在上级政府没有改变既定方针之前，下级无权发布与上级政府的规定相抵触的指示。中共湖北省委发布的关于农业税工作指示，不仅论点是错误的，而且是一种无组织无纪律的行为。望湖北省委检讨纠正。
