    ▲ In order to improve the living standards of people of all ethnic groups, the People's Government of Ningxia Province is organizing 30,000 camels to transport salt from the Jilantai and Chahan salt ponds. The total amount to be transported is one million dan (a unit of weight), which is about two and a half times the amount of pond salt sold outside Ningxia Province last year. The terminal stations for camel transport are Dengkou and Zhongwei; from here, the salt can be transported by land and water to Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces. After the task of transporting one million dan is completed, the wealth of the Hui, Han, and Mongolian people of the province will increase by more than 38 billion yuan.

The joint operation societies in various places actively solicit goods from cargo owners, and inter-agency business contracts are signed between the joint operation societies in various places to mutually solicit return cargo.
