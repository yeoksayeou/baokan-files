Response to "Suggestions for Improving Nonsensical Cross-Talk"

    Editor: We are very grateful for the correct opinions raised by Comrade Zhao Panxin in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on October 9 regarding our performances of cross-talk such as "Building Relationships" and "Peep Show." The reason we performed such nonsensical cross-talk is that we did not study politics enough. We have decided not to perform the "Building Relationships" segment anymore, and we have also begun to revise the "Peep Show" segment. We welcome the audience to give us more suggestions to help us improve our work.

    对“建议改进无理取闹的相声”意见的答复
    编辑同志：十月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏内赵盘新同志对我们演出的“搞交情”、“拉洋片”等相声提出了正确的意见，我们非常感激。我们演出这样无理取闹的相声，是因为我们政治学习不够的缘故。“搞交情”一段，我们决定不演了，“拉洋片”一段，我们也开始在修改。我们欢迎观众多多给我们提意见，帮助我们改进工作。
