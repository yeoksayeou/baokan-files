　　Our Group Improved Unity and Tools, Resulting in a General Fourfold Increase in Work Efficiency
　　At last year's National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, Chairman Mao instructed us: you must play the roles of model, backbone, and bridge. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said to me: "Comrade Liu Qingxiang, after you return to the factory, you must develop from an individual model to a collective model and exert collective strength." I kept these words firmly in my mind.
　　However, after returning to the factory, the group's production tasks could not be completed every month. There was a phenomenon of disunity among the comrades in the group. At that time, I thought it would be difficult to improve production in such a group. But when I thought of Chairman Mao's instructions, I plucked up the courage to overcome the disunity in the group. Therefore, I first talked to the two workers who had fought; then I explained to everyone that improving the group was the glory of all comrades in the group, and it was also everyone's responsibility. If there were any difficulties, we should discuss them together and never act out of anger. Under everyone's influence, the two workers who had fought both made self-criticisms. After that, I often talked to everyone and held criticism meetings. In this way, the phenomenon of disunity began to disappear.
　　After solving the problem of unity, everyone worked very hard, but the monthly production tasks still could not be completed. Everyone complained that the superiors assigned too many tasks. In order to study this issue, I participated in a production meeting and found that individual groups estimated work hours too high, and the group leaders did not carefully calculate the production tasks. For example, making a chuck should be estimated at 18 work hours, but other groups estimated 70 work hours; making a water pump should be estimated at two and a half work hours, but other groups estimated five work hours; our group's estimation of work hours was also incorrect, and we just did as much as the administrative side assigned. After detailed discussion and research at this meeting, it was decided what production tasks each group should be responsible for. In this way, the workers in our group all expressed that they could complete this task. We also clearly divided the work and allocated the work hours, so that everyone knew what to expect. As a result, the water pump work, which was supposed to take 50 days, was completed in 40 days. Within half a year, the group improved 11 large and small tools, generally increasing work efficiency by more than four times.
　　In the future, I am determined to work harder in production to enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, in order to repay our Party, Chairman Mao, and the people for their love and hope for me.

### 我们小组搞好团结改进了工具  使工作效率普遍提高了四倍

　　我们小组搞好团结改进了工具
    使工作效率普遍提高了四倍
    在去年的全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议上，毛主席指示我们：你们要起模范、骨干、桥梁、作用。全国总工会李立三副主席对我说：“刘庆祥同志，你回厂后要把个人模范，向集体模范发展，发挥集体力量。”这些话，我牢牢地记在心里。
    可是回厂后，小组的生产任务，每月都不能完成。全组同志有不团结的现象。当时我认为这样的小组，是不容易搞好生产的。但一想及毛主席的指示，我就鼓起勇气要克服组内不团结的现象。于是，我先找着了两个打架的工人谈话；又向大家说明：搞好小组是组里所有同志的光荣，也是大家的责任，有困难大家商量，决不能闹意气。那两个打架的工人在大家影响下，都作了检讨。在这以后，我便经常和大家谈话，开检讨会。这样，不团结现象才开始消除。
    解决了团结问题，大家工作得很努力，但每月的生产任务，还是不能完成。大家都埋怨上级分配任务太多。为了研究这个问题，我参加了一次生产会议，发现个别小组估工过高，组长对生产任务也不细算。比如做卡盘应估十八个工，别组却估七十个工；做水泵，应估两个半工，别组估五个工；我们组里估工也不正确，行政方面分配多少就干多少。经过这次会议的详细讨论研究，决定了每组应负的生产任务。这样，本小组的工人都表示能完成这个任务。我们并明确分了工，划分了工时，使大家心里有数。结果水泵工作，五十天的活，四十天就完成了。半年内，小组共改进大小工具十一种，普遍提高工作效率四倍以上。
    今后我决心在生产工作上更努力，以增强抗美援朝力量，来答复我们的党、毛主席，以及人民对我的爱护与希望。
