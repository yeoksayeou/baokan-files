    Kaifeng City Chengshi Waist Drum Shop Capitalist
    Cruelly Exploits Workers, Should Be Strictly Dealt With

    Editor: I am a worker at the Kaifeng City privately-owned Chengshi Waist Drum Shop. The workers in our shop are still suffering from the unreasonable oppression and illegal exploitation of the capitalist.

    The original regulations for privately-owned small factories in Kaifeng City stipulated that working hours should generally not exceed ten hours, but our working hours are from 5:00 AM to 12:00 AM, a full seventeen or eighteen hours, excluding rest time. Our shop manager, Liu, often forces us to work overtime and does not pay overtime. He does not allow us workers to hold meetings, and sometimes when he finds out we have had a meeting, he forces the workers to answer: "What kind of meeting did you have?" He is also completely unconcerned about the safety of the workers. For example, I recently became ill, and not only did he not tell me to seek treatment, but he also said that I was deliberately feigning illness. He limits our food intake, only allowing us to eat two meals a day, while he himself eats at the city's largest restaurant every day. His wife, whenever a female worker asks for leave or is late, says: "Don't mess around! If you don't want to work, get out, I have plenty of workers." I request the relevant departments in the city to help us resolve these issues.

    开封市诚实腰鼓店资方
    残酷剥削工人应予严格处理
    编辑同志：我是开封市私营诚实腰鼓店的工人。我店工人到今天仍受着资方的无理压迫与非法剥削。
    开封市私营小工厂在工时上原规定一般不能超过十小时，但我们的工作时间是从早晨五时至晚上十二时，除了休息时间外，足足要做十七或十八个小时。我店刘经理经常强迫我们加班工作，而且也不发加班费。他不许我们工人开会，有时知道开了会，就逼问工人：“开的什么会？”他对工人的安全也是毫不关心的，比如我最近生了病，他不但不叫我去治疗，而且还说我故意装病。他限制我们的饭量，每天只许吃两顿，他自己却天天到全市最大的饭庄吃饭。他的妻子每逢女工请假或来迟时，就说：“别捣蛋！不愿意干就滚蛋，我有的是工人。”我要求本市有关部门帮助我们解决这些问题。
