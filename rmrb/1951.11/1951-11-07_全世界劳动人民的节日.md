Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th: The newspaper Pravda published an editorial on November 5th, entitled "The Festival of the Working People of the World." The editorial stated: In celebrating the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, millions upon millions of working people in all countries look to our socialist motherland with hope and love. Progressive people justly regard the Soviet Union as the forerunner of a new communist society, as a tireless messenger in the struggle for the freedom and independence of all peoples, and as an invincible fortress of world peace.

    The Great October Socialist Revolution, carried out by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, marked a fundamental turning point in human history—from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. Therefore, progressive people all over the world hold deep sympathy for the Soviet state.

    The Great October Revolution overthrew the capitalist regime in one of the largest countries in the world, located at the junction of Europe and Asia. The Great October Revolution not only undermined the strength of imperialism in the center of imperialist rule, but also in its rear—the colonies and dependencies, opening a glorious new page in the history of the liberation struggles of all peoples in the West and the East.

    Pravda then recounted the most significant events that have occurred in the historical destiny of nations and countries in the thirty-four years since the victory of the October Revolution. Millions of working people are now fighting and winning victories under the banner of socialism and democracy, which was raised high by the Russian people in October 1917. As a result of the Soviet Union's defeat of the aggressive fascist countries in World War II, the people of several countries in Central and Southeastern Europe were able to embark on a new socialist path of development. The hundreds of millions of Chinese people who established the People's Republic of China have achieved great victories. The German Democratic Republic has also been established. The courageous Korean people are waging a heroic struggle against foreign aggressors for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

    Pravda continued: The friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies was born and strengthened in the flames of the common struggle for peace and a new life. The millions of working people in the People's Democracies express their deep gratitude to the Soviet Union for the fraternal and selfless assistance it has given them in their struggle for freedom, independence, and the laying of the foundations of socialism.

    Progressive people all over the world regard the communist country under construction as the embodiment of their greatest hopes and desires. Every year, more and more foreign delegations come to visit the Soviet state. Such visits stem from the sincere, strong, and almost maternal love that the working class and working masses of all countries hold for our socialist motherland, which has paved the way for peace, democracy, and socialism for all countries.

    A member of the delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association who visited the Soviet Union a few months ago said:
    "We have seen socialism being practiced. The Soviet people, with a spirit of internationalism, show concern for and provide assistance to the democratic people all over the world who are dedicated to peace."

    The editorial also stated that the Soviet people's historic victories in all aspects of economic, political, and cultural life, the Soviet people's large-scale construction projects on the Volga and the Dnieper, on the Don and the Amu Darya, and the Soviet people's extreme loyalty to the cause of peace, have inspired upright people in other countries and are examples that encourage the struggle for peace.

    A member of the Indian cultural workers delegation who visited the Soviet Union this summer said: "We learned a lot during our stay in the Soviet Union. People simply cannot believe, unless they see it with their own eyes, that the Soviet Union has made such amazing progress in just over thirty years. The Soviet Union, which represents one-sixth of the world's area, represents the entire new world."

    As time passes, the masses of people see more and more clearly the immeasurable superiority of the Soviet socialist system. The example of the Soviet Union shows the working people of all countries that socialism guarantees every nation unlimited possibilities for developing productive forces and prospering in economy and culture. Ellis, a member of the American workers delegation who visited the Soviet Union this year, said: "I have met many people in my life, but I have never seen such happy people. Everyone constantly uses the same word: 'Peace.' This is the word that people can hear most often in the Soviet state." The Soviet Union's outstanding achievements in peaceful construction and its peaceful foreign policy have inspired all good people to fight for the great cause of peace. The Leninist-Stalinist foreign policy of peace pursued by the Soviet government has won the sympathy and support of the vast majority of people around the world. The ranks of international peace advocates are expanding and strengthening day by day. More than 500 million good people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. This represents the will of all peace-loving people and their determination to achieve victory in the struggle for peace. Pravda concluded by saying that the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are invincible.

    全世界劳动人民的节日
    （真理报十一月五日社论摘要）
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：真理报于五日发表社论，题为“全世界劳动人民的节日”。社论说：在欢庆伟大十月社会主义革命纪念的日子里，各国千千万万的劳动人民都满怀希望和热爱地仰望着我们的社会主义祖国。进步的人们公正地把苏联看作新的共产主义社会的先驱者，看作争取各族人民的自由独立的斗争的不倦的使者，看作世界和平的不可战胜的堡垒。
    苏联人民在列宁与斯大林的党领导下进行的伟大十月社会主义革命，标志着人类历史的根本转变——从旧的资本主义世界转到新的社会主义世界。所以，全世界进步的人们都对苏维埃国家抱着深刻的同情。
    伟大十月革命在位于欧亚交界处的世界最大国家之一里推翻了资本主义政权。伟大十月革命不仅是在帝国主义统治的中心，同时还在它的后方——殖民地和附属国里破坏了帝国主义的力量，在西方和东方的各族人民的解放斗争的历史上，揭开了新的光荣的一页。
    真理报继即追述自从十月革命胜利以来三十四年间，在民族与国家的历史命运中所发生的最重大事件。千百万的劳动人民现在正在一九一七年十月俄国人民群众所高高举起的社会主义与民主的旗帜下进行战斗，并赢得胜利。由于苏联在第二次世界大战中击败了侵略的各法西斯国家，中欧和东南欧各若干国家的人民得以走上新的社会主义的发展道路。建立了中华人民共和国的数亿中国人民，已取得伟大的胜利。德意志民主共和国也成立了。刚勇的朝鲜人民正在进行着英雄的反对外国侵略者的斗争，争取他们祖国的自由与独立。
    真理报接着说：苏联、中华人民共和国与人民民主国家人民的友谊，是在争取和平与新生活的共同斗争的火焰中产生与获得力量的。人民民主国家的千百万劳动人民，对于苏联在他们争取自由、独立与为社会主义奠定基础的斗争中所给予他们的兄弟般的无私援助，表示深深的感谢。
    全世界的进步人民都认为正在建设中的共产主义国家是他们的最大的希望与意愿的体现。每年都可以看到越来越多的外国代表团前来访问苏维埃国家。这种访问，是出于各国工人阶级与劳动群众对于我们为各国的和平、民主与社会主义铺平了道路的社会主义祖国所怀有的热诚、强烈与几乎是母亲般的热爱。
    数月前访问苏联的中苏友好协会代表团团员说：
    “我们看到了正在实行中的社会主义。苏联人民怀着国际主义的精神，对全世界致力于和平的民主人民表示关怀，并对他们给予援助。”
    社论又说，苏联人民在经济、政治和文化生活等一切方面的历史性胜利，苏联人民在伏尔加河和第聂伯河、在顿河和阿姆河上进行的大规模建设工程，苏联人民对和平事业的极度忠诚，都鼓舞了其他国家的正直的人民，并且是鼓舞争取和平的斗争的范例。
    今年夏季访问苏联的印度文化工作者代表团团员说：“我们在逗留苏联期间，学到了许多东西。要不是亲眼看见，人们简直不能相信，在短短三十多年的期间，苏联取得了如此惊人的进步。占全世界面积六分之一的苏联代表着整个新世界。”
    随着时间的消逝，人民群众愈来愈清楚地看到苏联社会主义制度无可计量的优越性。苏联的范例向各国劳动人民表明了：社会主义保证了每一个民族都有发展生产力以及繁荣经济和文化的无限可能性。今年曾访问过苏联的美国工人代表团团员艾里斯说：“我一生碰到过不少人，但是我从来没有看见过像这样幸福的人。每一个人口头上经常挂着一个同样的字眼：‘和平’。这正是人们在苏维埃国家所能够最常听到的字眼。”苏联在和平建设方面的卓越成就和它的和平外交政策，鼓舞了全体善良人民为伟大的和平事业而斗争。苏联政府奉行的列宁、斯大林和平外交政策获得了全世界绝大多数人民的同情和支持。国际和平拥护者的阵线在一天天地扩大和增强。已经有五亿多善良人民在世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。这就表示了全体爱好和平人民的意志，表示了他们要在争取和平的斗争中取得胜利的决心。真理报最后说，和平、民主和社会主义的力量是不可征服的。
