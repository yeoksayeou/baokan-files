Investigation Report on the Situation of Five Rural Villages in the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Shanxi
Wang Qian, Secretary of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province

Editor's Note: This report was written by Comrade Wang Qian to Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as a special report on the situation in the old liberated areas (the subheadings in the text were added by the editor). The areas mentioned in the report have been through five years since the land reform. During these five years, agricultural production has generally recovered to or exceeded the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the face of the countryside has been completely renewed. The report vividly illustrates the superiority of the New Democratic system from the new changes in the old revolutionary base area, and at the same time, it raises many issues that the leading organs must pay attention to. The most important of these issues is how to lead the peasants' urgent demands for developing production after the completion of land reform and the stabilization of the production environment, and how to correctly guide the peasants forward. While leading the peasants to develop production, we must also pay close attention to the changes in the peasants' thinking in the development of production, and strengthen their political and ideological education. It is wrong to fail to lead the peasants' spontaneous trends, or to emphasize only one aspect one-sidedly (burying oneself in production or shouting empty political slogans). Another important issue mentioned in the report but not explained in detail is how to "eliminate the old and dirty things in the people's consciousness." This is a long-term, complex and serious task.
Such investigation reports are of great help in understanding the specific situation of an old liberated area and the future of the Chinese countryside. We hope that every old liberated area can also write such a report.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the old revolutionary base area of Shanxi drove out the Japanese imperialist aggressors, destroyed the state apparatus of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and landlords, and established a people's democratic regime.

Under Chairman Mao's instruction to "get organized," the people of the old revolutionary base area actively restored and developed agricultural production, and are relying on the Party's political work in the countryside to begin eliminating all old and dirty things in people's consciousness, in order to promote the continuous development of the New Democratic society.

In order to understand this changing situation in the rural areas of the old liberated area, we conducted investigations in five villages: Xiazhuang, Xiacun, and Hongjing Village in Licheng, Chuandi Village in Pingshun, and Suyuyu in Wuxiang. Now, we summarize their situation as follows.

I. New Changes in the Rural Economy and Class Relations

In the five villages we investigated, the land reform had been thoroughly completed long ago, and the peasants had been working and producing on their own land for five years. More than five years of production has enabled the vast majority of peasants to emerge from the situation of hunger and cold and develop towards prosperity. The era of "half a year of chaff and vegetables, no chaff in the meal, no saying" and "eat whatever you have, have whatever you eat" has passed, and has been replaced by the time of "golden queen" in the morning, "one-six-nine" at noon, "glass show" in the evening, "eat whatever you have" (Note 1). In the five villages, households with surplus grain accounted for 29.4%, and households with insufficient food accounted for only 3.3%. This is a fundamental change.

The recovery of the rural economy is rapid. The agricultural level exceeds 15% to 25% before the war (before the war, Suyuyu produced an average of 1.09 dan of grain per mu of cultivated land, and 1.255 dan in 1950. Before the war, Hongjing Village produced 1.6 dan of grain per mu of cultivated land, and 2 dan in 1950). The houses destroyed in the war have been basically repaired, and the destroyed agricultural tools and livestock have also been basically replenished. The recovery of the entire economy has gradually increased the purchasing power of the peasants. For example, the daily necessities supplied to the peasants by the Suyuyu Cooperative are increasing year by year. Taking 1949 as the base number, the Suyuyu Cooperative supplied 155% of fine cloth in 1950, 981% of cotton, 242% of edible salt, 143% of kerosene, and 315% of alkali; in the first quarter of 1951 alone, the supply of fine cloth was 55.4%, cotton was 375.8%, edible salt was 54.7%, kerosene was 28%, and alkali was 201%. The rapid recovery of the rural economy is due to the peasants' attention to farming techniques, but also to the planting of economic crops and the development of sideline occupations.

The vitality of the rural economy is also inseparable from the development of labor mutual aid teams. In the five villages we investigated, mutual aid teams have developed considerably. The result of labor mutual aid has greatly enhanced the labor efficiency of the peasants, enabling them to improve technology and develop sideline production. For example, the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team in Chuandi Village, Pingshun, last year, as a result of intensive cultivation, soil improvement, attention to technology, and construction of water conservancy projects, the output per mu of land exceeded 60% before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Last year, the output of the Xiazhuang mutual aid team in Licheng increased by an average of 45% compared with individual farmers. Last year, the income from sideline occupations accounted for 45% of the total agricultural income, and this year there has been an even greater increase.

Along with the development of labor mutual aid teams, another phenomenon worthy of attention is that some peasants, in order to further improve their production, improve production technology, and completely solve the problem of surplus labor, are no longer satisfied with the organizational form of mutual aid teams, and voluntarily transition from mutual aid teams to a higher form of organization, namely, agricultural production cooperatives. This is a collective economic organization of peasants still based on private ownership of land. The principle it implements is: the land is collectively managed by everyone, and the products are distributed uniformly according to labor and land. Its advantages are: it can unify the planning of land cultivation, plant crops according to local conditions, and give full play to the effectiveness of the land; it can implement a more rational division of labor according to the specialties and skills of the members than mutual aid teams; it can enhance the strength of collective investment and overcome the difficulties of individual farmers in expanding reproduction. For example, the Guo Yu'en and Guo Xiao two mutual aid teams in Chuandi Village, Pingshun, tried out an agricultural production cooperative in March this year under the principle of voluntariness. Currently, there are 18 households and 76 people participating. They work collectively with great enthusiasm, and various farming techniques have been significantly improved. This year's autumn harvest is good, with an increase of about two dou per mu. In addition, because a portion of the labor force is separated to engage in sideline production, the sideline income reaches more than 200 dan of coarse grain, accounting for more than 60% of the total autumn agricultural income of the cooperative. Because of these, the peasants who joined the cooperative feel that "agricultural production cooperatives are stronger than mutual aid teams."

The increase in agricultural production and the restoration of the rural economy from the ravages of war have started new changes in the rural class structure after the land reform. The class distribution in the five villages is: rich peasants (newly developed after the land reform) account for 0.6%, middle peasants account for 95.02% (prosperous middle peasants account for 2.22%), poor peasants and hired laborers account for 3.84%, and others account for 0.44%. The middle-peasantization of the countryside and the weak emergence of new rich peasants is the new characteristic of today's rural class relations. After the land reform in the five villages, 96 peasant households sold 284.11 mu of land due to weddings, funerals, and other reasons, and 99 peasant households bought land. The private ownership of land, natural disasters, and other irresistible attacks caused a small number of peasants to lose their labor and land and become newly impoverished, while another small number of peasants rose up. This is the foundation of rural class differentiation. The reason why a small number of peasants are still poor or become impoverished again is closely related to the fact that peasants have not yet been universally organized. In order to prevent a portion of peasants from becoming poor again due to natural and man-made disasters, it is necessary to vigorously develop cooperative and mutual aid organizations among the peasants and universally organize them.

II. The Peasants' Ideological Situation

With the victory of the Liberation War, the old revolutionary base areas obtained the possibility of peaceful production. Peasants eagerly demanded to develop production, recuperate and restore their economic strength. After the end of the land reform, the issuance of land certificates guaranteed the private ownership of peasants' land and other property, overcame the erroneous idea of being proud of poverty and the utopian agricultural socialist idea of absolute egalitarianism, and increased the peasants' confidence in developing production. Therefore, the peasants' production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. This is the ideological basis for us to be able to restore the rural economy in a short period of time.

However, what path should be taken to further develop production so that the vast majority of peasants can become prosperous? This question has not yet been resolved among the vast majority of peasants. Some peasants have realized that they must take the path of getting organized, but other peasants have not yet realized it. According to the survey, in the five villages, those who consciously take the road of getting organized to develop production account for 20% of the households. This group of people "cannot live without mutual aid teams." They realize that "relying on turning over and relying on mutual aid, we have today." Those who must help each other due to current production difficulties account for 37.7%; those who are willing to work alone account for 42.3%. The latter group of people yearn for the capitalist road to wealth. In Suyuyu, those who become rich by buying land account for 20% of the total number of households, so the land price exceeds twice that before the war. When land cannot be bought, they rely on lending money at usurious rates to get rich. The annual interest rate for material objects is as high as 60% and 180%. Although this phenomenon is not universal, it is worth noting.

In addition, due to the fact that political work could not keep up, with the recovery and development of production, peasants had a tendency to bury themselves in production, not ask about politics, be lightly dismissive and paralyzed, have slackened fighting spirit, and not see the enemy. Hidden counter-revolutionaries took advantage of secret societies, returning stubborn puppets, and landlord elements to spread rumors and sabotage, create change-of-heaven ideas, threaten the masses, and the reactionary arrogance was rampant for a while. Political slackness and paralysis were also reflected in the rural branches, and the specific manifestation was the "revolution successful" theory. This reflection was most prominent in the Suyuyu branch. Some party members were relatively demoralized in their work, some party members thought that the revolution had been successful, some party members were selfish, and even individual party members were degenerating and losing the basic conditions for being a party member.

From a fundamental point of view, all of these phenomena are caused by neglecting rural political work. This situation has changed during the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and patriotic production, and has changed even more after conducting party rectification education for party members. In the future, we must continue to conduct such education for peasants in order to further improve and consolidate their political understanding.

Politically improving the peasants, enabling them to combine national interests with personal interests, and combine temporary interests with long-term interests in concrete personal experience, and overcome light-hearted and paralyzed thinking, is a long-term and important political task.

III. Development of Cultural, Educational, and Health Undertakings

The result of the recovery and development of the rural economy has made it possible for peasants to provide their children with education and to have the mood to learn culture themselves. Therefore, they urgently demand to run schools, social education, and solve the problem of cultural learning for their children and themselves.

The enrollment rate of children in the five villages accounts for 82% of school-age children, exceeding that before the war. Three villages now have 23 students living in senior primary schools and 20 living in secondary schools, for a total of 43 people, including 10 girls. Three villages have 64 primary school students whose parents are preparing to send them to the city or nearby complete primary schools. These are all phenomena that did not exist before the war. The improvement of economic conditions has enabled the peasants to change their sad situation of "no one in the family has been to school for three generations."

Adult education is carried out through forms such as people's schools, newspaper reading groups, libraries, and picture and comic exhibitions. 83% of young and middle-aged people in the five villages participated in the people's school to learn culture. After two years, in four villages (missing Chuandi), 29% of adults can recognize less than 200 characters, 13% of adults can recognize less than 500 characters, 18% of adults can recognize less than 900 characters, and 10% of adults can recognize more than 1,000 characters. There are also 30% of adults who do not recognize a single character despite attending the people's school. If those who recognize about 900 characters are regarded as non-illiterate, then 28% of adults in the five villages have become cultured peasants.

Youth is the main backbone in cultural learning. The young men said, "As long as you have culture, you can do anything." The girls said, "Learning culture is not backward, and you can also find a cultured person as your partner." They regard learning culture as a major issue related to their own future. Many father-son models and husband-wife models have emerged in cultural learning. Keeping diaries and writing calligraphy have become mass movements.

Newspaper reading groups are also a good form of social education. They have been greatly developed in the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Now, nearly 30 newspapers are subscribed to in the five villages, and each newspaper reading group has 20 to 30 people who regularly listen to the news. Newspaper reading groups have played an important role in educating peasants and overcoming the peasants' paralyzed thinking of not asking about politics.

There is only one library in Chuandi Village, with 320 books. There are always 70 people reading books and picture books. Picture exhibitions are most popular among the masses, and each exhibition attracts a large number of people.

The periodic and concentrated form of rural entertainment is drama. Old dramas are the most "enjoyable" to watch. When one village performs a play, peasants from four villages come to watch, so the guests are crowded. There are also new dramas being performed, self-written and self-directed. Each village has a theater troupe composed of 20 to 30 peasant actors, and has also trained 3 to 5 new drama writing and directing talents. However, new dramas are not as popular as old dramas, so each village is raising money to buy boxes, hire teachers, and rehearse old dramas during the slack winter season. How to lead the old drama activities in the countryside and appropriately improve its content to make it a tool for educating peasants is a big problem. Other drum books, magic lanterns, twist yangko, stilt walking, little flower opera, and music troupes are all irregular forms of rural entertainment, which are welcomed by the masses. In recent years, sports activities such as table tennis and iron bars, as well as entertainment activities such as playing poker and chess, have begun to become popular in rural areas. Proper cultural life has replaced the old pastimes, so gambling has disappeared.

Illness and childbirth are great pains for the masses. There are no doctors when they are sick, and many babies die of "four-six wind" (Note 2) after birth. This is a problem that the masses urgently demand to solve. In recent years, rural family hygiene and public health have been greatly improved. For example, in Suyuyu, 39% of households did not wash pots and bowls and 35% of households did not clean their homes before the land reform. Now, only four households still do not wash pots and bowls or clean their homes. Peasants in Xiacun regularly sun their bedding and wash their clothes, and one-third of the families use scented soap to wash their faces and men also use soap. The whole village is cleaned every half month. Women have begun to pay attention to menstrual hygiene. In the past, small shoes or rotten cloth were used as pads during menstruation. Now, clean old cloth is used to make menstrual belts. The menstrual belts of young women in Xiacun are all made of new cloth and are washed after use. Hygiene has improved women's reproductive capacity, and the number of children born in recent years has greatly increased compared with the past. In order to reduce the "four-six wind," in the past two years, the government has trained many new-style midwives, which are very popular among the masses. However, nutrition during the postpartum period is still not paid attention to. Peasants have requested treatment when they are sick. Cowpox and vaccinations are carried out in Xiacun, Hongjing, and Xiazhuang every year. This year, the county hospital in Xiazhuang created a health care system and signed a contract with the hospital to conduct regular check-ups and treatments. Each participant pays a certain amount to the hospital each year. In four months, 42% of the farming families have participated in health care. This system is very popular among peasants and can be greatly promoted.

The development of rural cultural, educational, and health undertakings is, of course, only in its initial stage and there are still many difficulties and obstacles. But the effect has already been shown. The gradual improvement of the peasants' cultural level undoubtedly creates favorable conditions for us to further educate the peasants politically.

IV. Changes in the Marriage System

With the changes in the rural economic situation and the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law, the status of women has also changed. Women were assigned the same share of land in the land reform, and women also participated in labor in production. The era of "women are not people" has begun to pass. The women said, "In the past, we were oppressed and only had five major skills: crying, scolding, sleeping, not eating, and hanging ourselves. Now, the Marriage Law is a life-saving law, and divorce has ended the grievances." From 1942 to the present, there have been a total of 79 divorces and annulments of marriage contracts in the five villages, accounting for 28.8% of the number of marriages in the same period. From 1942 to the present in the five villages (Xiazhuang is from 1946 to the present), a total of 274 couples have been married, of which 48.6% have been married freely. The process of love between men and women is mostly because they work in the same mutual aid team, or they meet each other in cultural and entertainment activities, and fall in love. Some of them even write love letters to each other, encouraging labor and encouraging progress. It has gradually become legal for fiancées to sew and wash clothes for their fiancés, and for mothers-in-law to eat dumplings for their sons-in-law. It has gradually become more common for unmarried lovers to actively participate in labor and learning competitions, and to criticize and argue with each other at meetings of the Youth League.

Free marriage has consolidated the relationship between couples, and the chaos of the old society has changed. In the five villages, there were 342 men and women who were sexually promiscuous before the war, and now it has been reduced by 74%. Farmers who married freely said, "In the past, there was no way to live. I couldn't afford a wife, so I did bad things. Now I can marry freely and the relationship is very good. I would be sorry to do bad things again." The younger generation is less sexually promiscuous because they are afraid of "ruining their reputation" and unmarried people are afraid of "not being able to find a partner." Most of those who have abnormal sexual relations now are from the older generation.

In fact, freedom of marriage is still only in its beginning stages, and many serious struggles are still needed to be waged against conservatives. People who are not progressive, have no prospects, and are poor at labor oppose freedom of marriage. They say, "In the past, you could have a wife if you had money. Now it's voluntary, and I can't even find a wife." Some men also said angrily, "Women are being raised too high." "In this world now, you can't even control women, and they get divorced if you do anything wrong." But the women are saying, "Divorce is allowed and people don't die anymore."

V. Democratic and Harmonious Families Are Gradually Increasing

The transformation of the land system and the transformation of the marriage system are making family relations more harmonious. Among the 105 mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships in the five villages, the majority are democratic and harmonious and considerate to each other. Those who are not very harmonious account for about 24%, and those whose daughters-in-law are abused by their mothers-in-law account for about 2%. Many enlightened mothers-in-law say, "The world is better, and young people understand principles at meetings. Spinning and weaving cloth and working in the fields are much better than us, and they can learn well without us taking care of them." So they are all willing to "hand over power." Some mothers-in-law treat their daughters-in-law badly, and the daughters-in-law say to their mothers-in-law, "I also want to eat, wear, and work to produce, but I will not be oppressed by you." The mother-in-law is at fault, and she is no longer like the past when "if the mother-in-law farts, the daughter-in-law has to pick it up."

The relationship between husband and wife is also changing. Among the 311 couples we surveyed, 73% handle household chores equally, 9% of women are in charge of the household, and 17.7% of women still have no rights in the economy. Only one is still often beaten by her husband.

The phenomenon of drowning female infants has disappeared after the land reform. After the peasants' economic situation improved, girls also went to school, and the number of girls being sent to senior primary schools and middle schools is gradually increasing. This is a very important change. But boys are still preferred in the eyes of parents. Under the same conditions, boys are always allowed to go to school first, and boys are always given the best food first. They are still very anxious about not having a son to carry on the family line. The difference is that if there is no son, the daughter has the right to inherit.

The feudal relationship between father and son is also changing. In the past, "a family with a thousand mouths, one person in charge" was the patriarchal system, so "the son does not show himself when the father is present." Now, fathers often hand over family affairs to their sons, and some discuss them together, and income and expenses must be explained to each other. Many fathers are encouraging their sons to study and work. The phenomenon of beating sons is now rare.

When comparing the past with the present, the peasants said, "In the past, there were more opium addicts, gamblers, and thieves, but now there are more labor models; in the past, there were more bachelors and bad women, but now there are more model couples and children; in the past, there were more long-term workers, but now there are more people who are cadres and live in schools; in the past, there were more people who had nothing to eat and wear, but now there are more people who eat white flour and wear city cloth; in the past, there were more pawn tickets, but now there is more RMB." What was more in the past is now gone, and what is more now was not there in the past. This is a fundamental change. The peasants all feel that this is due to the good leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government. This fact shows that the rural areas of the old revolutionary base area after the land reform are developing towards a prosperous road.

However, there are still many problems in the new countryside that need to be solved. The main problem is how to educate the peasants, so that they can further organize to develop production, and continue to improve politically, understand that personal interests must be realized from the public interest, and eliminate the remnants of feudal ideas and habits. Only by further organizing can the interests of the peasants be reliably guaranteed, new production technologies can be widely used, and the economic, political, and cultural life of the countryside can be further developed. Only by continuing to improve politically can the party members, members of the Youth League, and other activists in the countryside see the great future of the country and their glorious tasks, so as not to be paralyzed and complacent, and surrender to the backward forces. And doing these two steps is to prepare conditions economically and politically for the future collectivization of agriculture.

      山西老区五个农村情况调查报告
      中共山西省长治地方委员会书记　王谦
   编者按：这一篇报告是王谦同志为了研究老解放区情况写给中共中央华北局书记薄一波同志的专题报告（文中小插题是编者加的）。报告中所讲的地区，在土地改革后已经经过五年。在这五年中间，农业生产已普遍地恢复到或超过抗日战争以前的水准，农村的面貌已经焕然一新。报告从老区农村新的变化中，具体生动地说明了新民主主义制度的优越性，同时，也给领导机关提出了许多必须注意的问题。这些问题中最重要的是对于农民在土地改革完成、生产环境安定之后发展生产的迫切要求，应当如何加以领导，如何正确地引导农民前进。在领导农民发展生产的同时，又必须密切注意农民在发展生产中的思想变化，加强对他们的政治思想教育。对于农民的自发趋势不加领导，或只片面地强调一面（埋头生产或空喊政治），都是错误的。另一个重要问题报告中提到了但是没有详细说明，即如何“清除人民意识中的陈旧的肮脏东西”。这是一个长期的复杂的严重工作。
   这样的考察报告，对了解一个老解放区的具体情况和中国农村的前途有很大帮助。我们希望每一个老解放区都能同样写出这样一篇报告来。
   山西老区人民，在中国共产党的领导下，驱逐了日本帝国主义侵略者，摧毁了官僚资产阶级与地主的国家机构，建立了人民民主政权。
   老区人民在毛主席“组织起来”的指示下，积极恢复和发展了农业生产，并且正在依靠党在农村中的政治工作，着手清除人们意识中一切陈旧的肮脏东西，以推动新民主主义社会不断向前发展。
   为了了解老解放区农村这一变化的情况，我们曾在黎城的霞庄、下村、洪井村，平顺的川底村，武乡的苏峪等五个村做了调查。现在概括地把它们的情形报告如下。
      一、农村经济和阶级关系的新变化
   在我们所调查的五个村子，由于土地改革早已彻底结束，农民在自己的土地上劳动生产，都已经有了五年的历史。五年多的生产，使广大农民从饥寒交迫的状况中走出，而向富裕的方向发展。“糠菜半年粮，饭里没糠没主张”，“吃什没什，有什吃什”的时代已成过去，而为“早晨‘金黄后’，晌午‘一六九’，晚上‘玻璃秀’，‘吃什有什’”（注一）的时光所代替。五个村农民有余粮户占百分之二九·四，不够吃户只占百分之三·三。这是一个根本性质的变化。
   农村经济的恢复是迅速的。农业水平超出战前百分之一五到百分之二五（战前苏峪每亩耕地平均产粮一·零九石，一九五○年为一·二五五石。战前洪井村每亩耕地产粮一·六石，一九五○年为二石），战争中被烧毁之房屋基本上修复，被毁农具，被抢牲口亦基本上得到补充。整个经济的恢复使农民购买力逐步提高。例如，苏峪合作社供给农民的生活资料，在逐年增加着。如以一九四九年为基数，苏峪合作社一九五○年供给之细布为百分之一五五，棉花为九八一，食盐为二四二，煤油为一四三，碱为三一五；一九五一年仅第一季度，细布供给即为百分之五五·四，棉花为三百七十五点八，食盐为五十四点七，煤油为二十八，碱面为二百零一。农村经济之迅速恢复，除由于农民讲究耕作技术外，种植经济作物，发展副业，也是一个重要原因。
   农村经济的活跃也是和劳动互助组的发展分不开的。在我们所调查的五个村中，互助组都已有相当发展。劳动互助的结果，使农民的劳动效率大大增强，使他们有力量改进技术，发展副业生产。例如平顺川底村郭玉恩互助组，由于精耕细作、改良土壤、讲究技术、兴修水利的结果，去年每亩地的生产量比抗战前超过了百分之六十。黎城霞庄互助组去年的产量，平均比单干农户增加了百分之四十五。副业的收入，去年占农业总收入的百分之四十五，今年更有增加。
   和劳动互助组的发展同时，值得注意的另一种现象，是有些农民为了更加提高自己的生产，改进生产技术，彻底解决劳动力的剩余问题，已不满足于互助组的组织形式，而自愿地由互助组过渡到更高级的一种组织形式，即农业生产合作社。这是仍然建立在土地私有制基础上的农民的集体的经济组织。它所实行的原则是：土地由大家集体经营，生产物则按劳力和土地统一分配。它的优点是：可以统一计划土地的耕作，因地制宜种植作物，充分发挥土地的效能；可以按照社员的特长和技术，实行比互助组更合理的分工；可以增强集体投资的力量，克服个体农民无力扩大再生产的困难。例如，平顺川底村郭玉恩、郭小有两个互助组，已于今年三月间在自愿的原则下，试办了一个农业生产合作社。现参加者共有十八户，七十六口人。他们集体地劳动，热情极高，各种耕作技术显著改进，今年秋禾收成良好，每亩增产约在二斗以上。此外，由于分出一部分劳动力进行副业生产，副业收入达粗粮二百余石，占全社秋季农业收入的百分之六十以上。因为这些，入社的农民都感觉“农业生产合作社就是比互助组强”。
   农业生产的提高，农村经济的战争创伤的复原，使土地改革后的农村阶级结构开始了新的变化。五个村的阶级分布是：富农（土地改革后新发展的）占百分之零点六，中农占百分之九十五点零二（富裕中农占百分之二点二二），贫雇农占百分三点八四，其他占百分之零点四四。农村中农化，并开始微弱地出现新的富农，这就是今天农村阶级关系新的特点。五个村土地改革后有九十六户农民因婚丧等原因出卖了二八四点一一亩土地，有九十九户农民买地。土地的私有，自然灾害和其他不可抵抗的袭击，使一小部分农民丧失劳力和土地，从新贫困起来，而另一小部分农民上升，这就是农村阶级分化的基础。一小部分农民所以仍然贫困或重新贫困，是和农民尚未普遍组织起来有密切关系的。为了防止一部分农民因天灾人祸重新穷下去，就必须在农民中大力发展合作互助组织，使农民普遍组织起来。
      二、农民的思想情况
   随着解放战争的胜利，老区取得了和平生产的可能。农民急切地要求发展生产，休养生息恢复自己的经济力量。在土地改革结束后，土地证的颁发，保障了农民的土地及其他财产的私有权，克服了以穷为荣的错误思想和绝对平均的空想农业社会主义思想，增加了农民发展生产的信心。所以农民生产情绪空前高涨。这就是我们能够在短的时间内，使农村经济能以恢复的思想基础。
   但是，走什么道路进一步发展生产，才能使绝大多数农民走向富裕呢？这个问题却还未在广大农民中得到解决。一部分农民已认识到必须走组织起来的道路，但另一部分农民尚未认识到。据调查，五个村中，自觉地走组织起来发展生产道路者，占户数之百分之二十，这部分人“离不开互助组”，他们认识到“靠翻身、靠互助，才有了今天”；因目前生产上困难必须互助者占百分之三十七点七；愿意单干者占百分之四十二点三。后一部分人憧憬着资本主义式的发财道路。在苏峪，发家买地者占全村户数百分之二十，所以地价超出战前一倍。当土地买不到的时候，即靠放高利贷发财，实物利息的年利有高至百分之六十及百分之一百八十者。这种现象虽不普遍，却是值得注意的。
   此外，由于政治工作不能与之相适应，随着生产的恢复与发展，农民中曾发生埋头生产，不问政治，轻敌麻痹，斗志松懈，看不见敌人的思想倾向。潜伏的反革命分子却利用会道门、还乡顽伪人员、地主分子造谣破坏，制造变天思想，威胁群众，反动气焰嚣张一时。政治上的松懈麻痹，同样反映到农村支部中，其具体表现即是“革命成功”论。苏峪支部中这种反映最突出。有些党员工作情绪比较消沉，有些党员以为革命已经成功，某些党员表现自私，甚至个别党员在蜕化，丧失了做一个党员的起码条件。
   以上这些现象从根本上说来，都是由于忽视农村政治工作所造成的。这种情形，在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国主义生产运动中，已有了改变，在对党员进行整党教育后，有了更多的改变。今后必须继续对农民进行这样的教育，才能使他们的政治认识进一步提高和巩固。
   从政治上提高农民，使农民在具体的切身体验中，把国家利益与个人利益结合起来，把暂时利益和长远利益结合起来，克服轻敌麻痹思想，这是一个长期性的重要的政治任务。
   三、文教卫生事业的发展
   农村经济恢复和发展的结果，使农民有可能供给自己的子女读书了，自己也有心情学文化了，所以迫切地要求办好学校教育、社会教育，解决子女与自己的文化学习问题。
   五个村入学儿童占学龄儿童之百分之八十二，超出了战前。三个村现住高级小学的学生二十三人，住中等学校者二十人，两者共计四十三人，其中并有十个女生。三个村有六十四个小学生，他们的家长准备送他们到城里或附近的完小去念书。这都是战前所没有的现象。经济状况的改善，使农民们有可能改变他们“三代也没有出个念书人”的悲痛景况。
   成人教育是经过民校、读报组、图书馆、图片漫画展览等形式进行的。五个村有百分之八十三的青壮年参加了民校学文化。经过两年时间，在四个村里（缺川底），已有百分之二十九的成人识到二百字以下，百分之十三的成人识字五百以下，百分之十八的成人识字九百以下，百分之十的成人识字千字以上，也还有百分之三十的成人虽入民校而一字不识。如果把识字九百左右的当作非文盲的话，五个村即有百分之二十八的成人已成为有文化的农民了。
   文化学习中，青年是主要的骨干，小伙子们说：“只要有文化，啥事都能干。”姑娘们说：“学文化不落后，找对象也可找个有文化人。”他们把学文化都当作有关自己前途的重大问题。学文化中出现了不少父子模范，夫妻模范。记日记，写大楷，已成为群众性的运动。
   读报组也是进行社会教育的很好形式。在抗美援朝运动中已得到较大发展。现在五个村订报纸近三十份，每个读报组都有二、三十人经常听报。读报组在教育农民，克服农民不问政治的麻痹思想上起了重要的作用。
   图书馆只川底村有一处，有书三二○本，经常有七十人看书、看画报。图片展览最受群众欢迎，每次展览都吸引了广大群众。
   农村娱乐，定期而集中的形式是戏剧。旧剧看得最“得劲”，一村唱戏，四村农民都来看，所以客人拥挤。也有演新戏的，自编自演，每村都有一个由二、三十个农民演员组成的剧团，亦锻炼出三至五人的新剧编导人材。但新剧不如旧剧有群众，所以各村在冬季农闲时，都在摊钱买箱子，请教师，排演旧剧。如何领导农村中的旧剧活动，适当改良它的内容，使它成为教育农民的工具，这是一个大问题。其他鼓书、幻灯、扭秧歌、踩跷、小花戏、音乐团都不定期地成为农村的娱乐形式，成为群众所欢迎的形式。最近几年来农村里已开始流行乒乓球、翻铁杠等体育活动和打扑克、下象棋等娱乐活动。正当的文化生活代替了旧的消遣，所以赌博绝迹。
   疾病、生孩子是群众很大的痛苦，病了无医生，生下孩子患“四六风”（注二）死的不少。这是群众迫切要求解决的问题。最近几年来农村家庭卫生和公共卫生有很大改进，如苏峪，土地改革前有百分之三十九的户不洗锅碗，百分之三十五的户不打扫家，现在只有四户还不洗锅碗，不扫家。下村农民经常晒被褥，洗衣服，并有三分之一的人家，女人洗脸用香皂，男人也用肥皂了。全村每隔半月大扫除一次。妇女们开始注意了月经卫生，过去月经来用小鞋或烂布垫，现在用干净的旧布做月经带。下村的青年妇女月经带都是新布做的，用后都要洗过。卫生使妇女生育能力提高了，最近几年来小孩生的比以往大为增加。为了减少“四六风”，最近两年，政府训练了许多新法接产婆，大受群众欢迎。但产期中的营养还是不讲究的。农民有了疾病已要求治疗。下村、洪井、霞庄每年种牛痘、打防疫针。霞庄今年由县医院创办一种保健制度，和医院订合同，定期检查治疗，每个参加保健者每年向医院出费若干，四个月已有百分之四十二的农家参加了保健。这种制度很为农民欢迎，可以大加推广。
   农村文教卫生事业的发展，现在当然还只在开始阶段，还有许多困难和障碍。但是作用已经显出来了。农民文化程度的逐渐提高，毫无疑问地，也为我们进一步从政治上教育农民树立了有利的条件。
      四、婚姻制度的变化
   随着农村经济状况的变化及婚姻法的公布实行，妇女的地位也已有了改变。土地改革中妇女们分到同样一份土地，生产中妇女又参加了劳动。“女人不是人”的时代开始成为过去了。妇女们说：“过去我们受压迫后只有五大本领，一哭、二骂、三睡觉、四不吃饭、五上吊。现在“婚姻法是救命法，兴了离婚断了冤鬼。”从一九四二年到现在，五个村离婚解除婚约的共七十九件，占同一时期结婚数的百分之二八点八。五个村从一九四二年到现在（霞庄是一九四六年到现在），共结婚二七四对，其中自由结婚者已占百分之四十八点六。男女恋爱的过程大都是因为在一个互助组中劳动，或者在文化娱乐活动中互相认识，发生了爱情，有的并且互写情书，鼓励劳动，鼓励进步。未婚妻给未婚夫缝洗衣服，老丈母给未婚婿吃饺子，现在都逐渐成为合法的了。未婚的情人积极参加劳动和学习竞赛，在青年团的会议上互相批评争论的事，也逐渐多起来了。
   自由婚姻巩固了夫妇感情，旧社会性乱的情形在改变。五个村战前青壮年男女性乱者有三四二人，现在减少了百分之七十四。自由结婚的农民说：“以前生活没办法，娶不起老婆才做坏事，现在自由结婚，感情很好，再做坏事就对不起人。”青年一代性乱者较少，怕“败坏名誉”，未结婚的怕“找不到对象”。现在性关系不正常者大都为老一代。
   事实上婚姻自由也还在开始，对于守旧派还需要经过许多严重的斗争。不进步，没出息，劳动差的人们是反对婚姻自由的，他们说：“过去有钱就可以有老婆，现在自愿了，我连个老婆也找不到。”也有一部分男人愤愤地说：“把妇女提得太高了。”“现在这个世道，连女人也不敢管了，一不对就离婚。”但女人们在说：“兴了离婚不死人了。”
   五、民主和睦的家庭逐渐增加
   土地制度的变革和婚姻制度的变革，正在使家庭关系走向和睦。五个村婆媳关系有一○五对，民主和睦、互相体贴者已占多数，不很和睦者约占百分之二十四，媳妇受婆婆虐待者约占百分之二。有许多开通的婆婆说：“世道好了，年青人开会懂道理。纺花织布，上地劳动，比咱强得多，不用咱管也能学好。”所以她们都愿意“交权”。有的婆婆对媳妇不好，媳妇对婆婆说：“我也要吃也要穿，也要劳动生产，就是不受你的压迫。”婆婆理短，也就不像过去那样“婆婆放个屁，媳妇也得拾起”了。
   夫妇关系也在发生变化。我们所调查的三一一对夫妇，平等处理家务者占百分之七三，妇女当家者占百分之九，妇女在经济上仍无权利者占百分之十七·七。只有一个还经常挨男人的打。
   溺死女婴的现象，在土地改革后已经绝迹。农民经济情况改善后，女孩也念书了，送女孩住高小、中学的逐渐增多，这是一个很重要的变化。但男孩在父母的心眼里总还是偏待些，同样条件总是先让男孩念书，有好吃的总还是先给男孩吃，没有男孩还是十分焦虑着绝后。所不同者，是没有男孩，女孩有了继承权。
   封建的父子关系也在改变。过去“家有千口，主事一人”，这是宗法的家长制度，因此“父在不显子”。现在做父亲的常把家事交给儿子，有的是共同商量，收入开支都要互相交代。不少父亲在鼓励儿子的学习、劳动。打儿子的现象现在少见了。
   农民们在对比着过去与现在的时候说：“过去吸大烟、赌鬼、小偷多，现在劳动模范多；以前光棍、坏女人多，现在模范夫妇，小孩多；以前长工多，现在当干部，住学校的多；以前没吃没穿的多，现在吃白面、穿市布的多；以前当票多，现在人民币多。”过去多的现在没有了，现在多的过去没有，这是一个根本的改变。农民们都感到这是由于毛主席、共产党、人民政府领导得好。这个事实，说明了土地改革后的老区农村正在向繁荣的道路发展。
   但是新的农村中仍有许多问题需要加以解决，这些问题中主要的就是如何教育农民，使农民们进一步组织起来发展生产，并且在政治上继续提高，懂得必须从公共的利益中实现个人的利益，并且消灭封建思想习惯的残余。只有进一步组织起来，农民的利益才能得到可靠的保障，新的生产技术才能广泛地利用，农村的经济生活和政治文化生活才能得到进一步的发展。只有政治上的继续提高，农村中的党员、团员和其他积极分子才能看到国家的伟大的前途和自己的光荣的任务，而不至麻痹自满，对落后的力量投降。而做到这两步，也就是为将来的农业的集体化在经济上和政治上准备了条件。
