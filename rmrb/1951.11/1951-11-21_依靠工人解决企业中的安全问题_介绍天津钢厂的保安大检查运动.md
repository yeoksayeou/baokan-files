    Relying on Workers to Solve Safety Problems in Enterprises
    ——Introducing the Security Inspection Campaign at Tianjin Steel Plant
    Chen Xu
    Tianjin Steel Plant conducted a plant-wide security inspection in August of this year. More than 90% of the plant's employees participated in this movement. During the inspection process, a total of 575 problems were discovered, of which 194 were immediately solved by the workers themselves, 80 were solved in a timely manner by the administration, 284 were being solved, and only 17 were requested to be solved by higher authorities. In the 274 cases that have been resolved, workers have worked hard to catch up with the work, totaling 4,391 workdays, plus the value of work completed using waste materials, amounting to approximately 371.65 million yuan. This is a meaningful achievement.
      Inspecting and Improving Simultaneously
    During the inspection movement, a thorough inspection and study of the safety status of all plant buildings and equipment was carried out, and improvement plans were formulated in a timely manner. More than 98% of the plant's machines were equipped with gear guards or switch boxes during the inspection process, and all high-voltage lines were equipped with protective nets. All dangerous areas, such as the gas furnace passage section of the plant's steelmaking department and the intersection of the railway and pedestrian paths in the general distribution warehouse, were equipped with clear signs and protective devices. All these improvements and additions to safety equipment directly guaranteed the safety of workers. The first day the First Branch plant installed iron railings on the alloy furnace platform, the next day, worker Li Tongfa suddenly fainted due to illness, but because of the railings, he avoided the danger of falling into the molten iron pool.
    Mobilizing Workers to Discuss Safety
    Regulations
    Secondly, during the inspection campaign, the masses were widely mobilized to discuss various safety regulations, such as the "Regulations for the Custody and Use of Personal Protective Equipment," "Technical Safety Operation Procedures," "Labor Safety Regulations," "Shift Handover System," "Machine Maintenance System," and "Accident Investigation Statistical Reporting Regulations." Because the workers fully discussed these regulations, not only were these regulations supplemented and revised in many ways, but also the implementation of these regulations had a solid mass foundation. Administrative leaders promptly resolved some unreasonable phenomena revealed during the inspection, such as some workshops not issuing labor protection equipment to temporary workers, and some workers only being able to receive old gloves that had been replaced. Much work has also been done in terms of safety and hygiene equipment, such as expanding clinics, increasing medical staff, organizing and adding toilets, and universally setting up yarn cabinets for storing food in workshops.
    Demarcating Areas and Clarifying Safety Responsibilities
    Thirdly, the demarcation work in the plant's safety inspection is particularly worth mentioning. This is a very complex issue in the safety responsibility system. The specific content of this work is to clearly divide the responsible areas of each department of the plant, including branches, workshops, and work sections and work groups within the workshops; and stipulate the safety and hygiene conditions that must be guaranteed in each area. The plant first measured the division map of the boundaries of each department and workshop by the plant, and then each branch workshop mobilized workers to discuss and study, and then drew a detailed division map of the work section inside the workshop. As a result, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of all employees were greatly stimulated, and the employees' understanding of safety and hygiene was improved. A vigorous site cleanup campaign appeared throughout the plant. The workers of the steelmaking department of the plant quickly moved and sorted more than 400 tons of waste steel that had not been cleaned up for more than a year through voluntary labor, cleaned out 5 tons of coke from the filter pool, found 400 kilograms of waste steel from the slag, and found more than 50 waste wood from the river. The wire rod department cleaned up more than 40 tons of waste iron wire; the barbed wire machine and galvanizing machine that had not been used for many years were also handled separately. The First Branch plant also made detailed and clear decisions on the storage locations of finished products and raw materials. Many of these materials had been abandoned for many years due to insufficient responsibility. In this way, the plant quickly eliminated the chaotic phenomenon in all parts of the plant in a short period of time, thoroughly rectified the plant appearance, and thus quickly established a new and orderly production order.
      Workers' Production Enthusiasm Improved
    Fourth, due to the leadership's emphasis on safety issues, the relationship between leaders and the masses was further strengthened, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was further improved. The workers used their brains during the inspection and overcame many difficulties in production. In the past, the Second Branch plant wanted to convert the wire washing acid tank into a lead pot, but was worried that the use of foreign nails would still leak juice. This time, it absorbed the experience of the wire rod department of the General Plant and used the method of pure lead welding to solve this difficulty and extend its service life by more than three times. The staff of the General Distribution Warehouse actively discovered many usable steel materials and usable parts, which added a lot of wealth to the country.
    Relying on the Masses Can Solve Safety Problems
    Many enterprise leaders used to think that safety problems must be solved by appropriations from higher authorities, and if higher authorities cannot allocate additional funds, safety problems cannot be solved. This idea is essentially refusing to improve security work. The security inspection of Tianjin Steel Plant proves that as long as the leadership attaches importance to and relies on the masses, the safety problems in the enterprise can be solved. Of the 575 problems discovered in the plant's inspection, only 17 were requested to be solved by higher authorities, accounting for 2.9% of all problems. This powerfully proves that as long as the leadership attaches importance to and relies on the masses, most of the problems existing in safety work can be solved.

    依靠工人解决企业中的安全问题
    ——介绍天津钢厂的保安大检查运动
    晨旭
    天津钢厂于本年八月进行了全厂性的保安大检查。全厂百分之九十以上的职工参加了这一运动。在检查过程中，共发现问题五百七十五件，其中已由工人群众自己动手立即解决者一百九十四件，由行政方面组织力量及时解决者八十件，正在解决者二百八十四件，请求上级解决者仅十七件。在已解决的二百七十四件中，工人群众努力赶工，合计四千三百九十一工日，加上利用废料完成的工作价值，约达三亿七千一百六十五万元。这是一个有意义的成就。
      一面检查一面改进
    在检查运动中，首先对全厂的建筑物与设备的安全状况，进行了彻底的检查与研究，及时制订了改善的计划。全厂机器的百分之九十八以上，都在检查过程中装设了牙轮罩或电闸盒，全部高压线都安装了保护网。所有危险区域，如该厂炼钢部煤气炉通道部分，总分库铁路与行人道交错部分，都设立了显明的标志和防护装置。所有这些安全设备的改善与增添，都直接保障了工人的劳动安全。该厂三分厂第一天在合金炉台上安装了铁栏杆，第二天工人李同发因病突然晕倒，因为有了栏杆，避免了掉入铁水池的危险。
    发动工人群众，讨论了安全
    制度
    其次，在检查运动中，普遍发动群众，讨论了各种安全制度，如“个人防护用具保管使用规程”，“技术安全操作规程”，“劳动安全条例”，“交接班制度”，“机器检修制度”，“事故调查统计报告规程”等。由于工人群众充分讨论了这些制度，不但使这些制度得到很多的补充修正，而且使得这些制度的贯彻执行，有了坚实的群众基础。行政领导方面对于在检查中揭发的一些制度上的不合理现象，如有的车间不给临时工发劳动保护设备，有的工人只能领到换下来的旧手套等，都及时地加以解决。在安全卫生设备方面，也作了许多工作，如扩大诊疗所，增加医务人员，整理增设厕所，普遍在车间设置食物存放纱柜等。
    圈地划界，明确了安全责任
    其三，特别值得介绍的是该厂安全检查中的圈地划界工作。这是安全责任制中一个很复杂的问题。这个工作的具体内容就是要明确划分全厂每一个部门，包括分厂、车间以及车间内部工作段、工作小组的责任区域；并规定每一个区域内必须保证作到的安全卫生状况。该厂先由厂部测定了各部门各车间划分界限的区分图，然后由各分厂车间，发动工人讨论研究，再详细绘制车间内部工作段的区分图。其结果就大大激发了全体职工的积极性与责任心，提高了职工对安全卫生的认识，在全厂范围内出现了一个轰轰烈烈的工地清理运动。该厂炼钢部工人以义务劳动迅速搬移整理了年余未曾清理过的废钢四百余吨，在滤水池中清出了焦炭五吨，由炉渣中找出废钢四百公斤，在河边找出废木料五十余根。线材部清理出废铁丝四十多吨；对于多年不用的刺铁丝机，镀锌板机，也分别作了处理。一分厂更对成品、原料的存放地点，作了详细明确的划分决定。这许多器材都是由于责任不够明确而长年被遗弃的。这样，该厂在短期内即消除了全厂各处的紊乱无章现象，彻底整顿了厂容，从而迅速地建立了全新的有条不紊的生产秩序。
      工人生产积极性提高了
    第四，由于领导上重视安全问题，进一步密切了领导与群众的关系，群众生产积极性随着提高了一步。工人群众在检查中开动脑筋，克服了许多生产上的困难。该厂二分厂过去想把洗丝酸池改为铅锅，但顾虑用洋钉铆制仍要漏汁，此次吸取总厂线材部经验，利用纯铅烧焊的办法，解决了这个困难，并使其使用寿命延长了三倍以上。总分库职工主动发现了很多可用的钢材及可利用的零件，为国家增加了不少财富。
    依靠群众就能解决安全问题
    许多企业领导干部，曾经认为安全问题必须靠上级拨款才能解决，如上级不能另外拨款，就无法解决安全问题。这种想法实质上是拒绝改进保安工作。天津钢厂保安大检查证明了只要领导重视、依靠群众，就能解决企业中的安全问题。该厂在检查中发现的五七五件问题中请示上级解决者仅十七件，计占全部问题的百分之二点九。这便有力地证明了只要领导重视，依靠群众，则存在于安全工作上的绝大部分问题是可以解决的。
