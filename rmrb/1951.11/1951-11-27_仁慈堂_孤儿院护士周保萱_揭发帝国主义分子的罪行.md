    "Ren Ci Tang" Orphanage Nurse Zhou Baoxuan Exposes the Crimes of Imperialist Elements
    To the Editor: I used to be a child at the "Ren Ci Tang" in Xishiku, Beijing, where I suffered all kinds of torture. The children there had to do needlework from a very young age. If they couldn't learn after being taught once or twice, the imperialist elements in the orphanage would prick them with needles or hit them with rulers. The children were constantly hungry because they never had enough to eat, and they would scavenge in the sewage for fruit peels and other leftovers discarded by the imperialist elements. Later, I worked in the orphanage's infirmary and saw that they treated the sick children even more cruelly. They didn't give the sick children proper treatment. Before they had recovered, they would force the sick children to go back to work. The more they were tortured, the sicker they became, and many children died in this way. When Japanese imperialism occupied Beijing, "Ren Ci Tang" built a small house near the "Mass Graves" outside the city. Two people guarded the house. Severely ill children were sent there, and after they died, they were thrown into the "Mass Graves." There was also a tragic incident. The mother of a former orphanage child, Mi Minhua (who worked in the orphanage), was seriously ill and staying in the infirmary. She wanted a drink of water, but the imperialist elements forbade anyone from giving her water. She begged everyone at night, but no one dared to give her any. Later, the imperialist elements found out, tied her legs to the bedposts, hung up her hands, and slapped her. Mi Minhua's mother was tortured to death in this way. They are truly heartless devils. I demand that the government quickly take over "Ren Ci Tang" and punish these imperialist elements who are slaughtering the Chinese people!

    “仁慈堂”孤儿院护士周保萱
    揭发帝国主义分子的罪行
    编辑同志：以前我是北京西什库“仁慈堂”的孩子，在那里我受尽了折磨。这里的孩子从很小就要做针线活。教一、两次学不会，堂里的帝国主义分子就用针扎、用尺打。孩子们因为每天吃不饱，饿得到秽水里去捞帝国主义分子吃剩的水果皮和其他东西。后来我到堂里的病房里工作，看到他们对待有病的孩子更残酷。他们不给有病的孩子好好治。病还未好，就又把病孩子弄出去做工。越折磨病越重，很多孩子都是这样地死去了。日本帝国主义占领北京的时候，“仁慈堂”在城外“万人坑”附近盖了一所小房子。房子里有两个人看守。病重的孩子送来以后，死后就被扔进“万人坑”。还有一桩悲惨的事。前本堂儿童密敏华的母亲（在堂内当工人），病重住在病房里，她想喝口水，帝国主义分子禁止任何人给她水喝。她在夜间央求大家，可是谁也不敢给她水。后来帝国主义分子知道了，把她的腿绑在床腿上，把手吊起来，打她的耳光。密敏华的母亲就这样被虐杀了。他们真是没有心肝的东西，我要求政府快快接管“仁慈堂”，惩办这些残杀中国人民的帝国主义分子！
