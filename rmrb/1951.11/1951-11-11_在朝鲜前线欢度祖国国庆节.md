Celebrating the Motherland's National Day on the Korean Front
                  By Ruo Yun, of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    Today is the eve of National Day. Most of my comrades are writing letters to their relatives in the motherland. Some comrades are sending home their merit certificates, which they have kept for a long time.

    We are fighting. During the day, there is the roar of artillery fire, and at night there are flashing flares. However, the soldiers are all in high spirits today. Everyone says, "Let the battle be fierce! No matter what, we must decorate the position properly for this great National Day." Some comrades drew large pictures of Tiananmen Square and hung them below the portrait of Chairman Mao in the air-raid shelter. Some took out picture cards they had treasured for many days and pasted them in the trenches. These picture cards were mostly collected and clipped from newspapers, including pictures from the People's Daily titled "Our Great Motherland" and from the China Youth Daily titled "Everything for the Motherland." Below these pictures, the soldiers wrote slogans: "Motherland, we are defending you!" These pictures are so attractive!

    In the bushes on the position, the soldiers built decorated archways adorned with pine and cypress branches and wildflowers. On the archways hung plaques with the words "Celebrating National Day." On the other side of the archways, the soldiers wrote their vows to the people of the motherland: "Guard it, the gateway to the motherland."

    On this day, many models appeared on the position—there were rice paddies and thatched cottages from Jiangnan, and the ancient Great Wall of North China. On this day, groups of two or three were talking everywhere on the position, talking about the achievements of the motherland over the past year, talking about their own victories. As they talked, they began to sing. They sang "The East is Red..." and "Our Motherland is So Vast and Wide...", as well as songs composed by the soldiers themselves: "We crossed the Yalu River and fought across the Chongchon River and the Taedong River, how glorious! We defended the Yellow River and the Yangtze River..." This day was filled with joy and jubilation everywhere. On this day, though we are on the Korean front, our hearts are already with the people of the motherland.

    Not many days ago, we joyfully saw off Guan Chonggui, the special-class merit citation combat hero who killed more than fifty enemies and shot down an enemy plane with a single machine gun at Hill 614, as he returned to the motherland to participate in National Day celebrations. The soldiers in the company were extremely excited, surrounding him and chatting. Lu Jinjun, the squad leader of the Seventh Squad who fought alongside Guan Chonggui on Hill 614, repeatedly urged him: "When you get back to Beijing and see Chairman Mao, be sure to say hello for us. And when you come back, please bring a recent picture of Chairman Mao." Mark Xin, the ammunition handler who fought with Guan Chonggui on Hill 614, asked him: "The people of the motherland sent a delegation to visit us last time, now you represent us. When you see the people of the motherland, be sure to visit them on our behalf. Their donation campaigns and their construction achievements encourage us to advance more courageously." Wang Ke and Zou Xiaorong carried the machine gun that Guan Chonggui had handed over to them after he was promoted to deputy platoon leader. They said: "Deputy Platoon Leader, you can go back to the country with peace of mind. When we use your machine gun, we guarantee to fight as well as you did." The soldiers repeatedly instructed him: "Be sure to explain clearly to the people of the motherland! We will definitely win even greater glory for the people of the motherland."

    在朝鲜前线欢度祖国国庆节
                  中国人民志愿军某部　若云
    今天是国庆节的前夕。伙伴们大都在此时向祖国的亲人们写信。有些同志把放了很久的立功喜报，寄回家去。
    我们正在战斗，白天是炮声隆隆，夜晚有闪闪的照明弹。可是，战士们今天都兴致勃勃。大家说：“战斗再激烈吧！无论如何在这伟大的国庆节，也得把阵地上布置得像个样子。”有的同志画了大幅的天安门图画，挂在防空洞里的毛主席相片下面。有的把自己珍存多日的画片拿出来贴在工事交通壕里。这些画片大都是从报纸上收集剪裁下来的，其中有人民日报上的“我们伟大的祖国”图片，也有中国青年报上的“一切为了祖国”图片。在这些图片下面，战士们写着标语：“祖国，我们保卫着你！”这些画片是多么吸引人啊！
    在阵地上的树丛中，战士们搭起了饰满了松柏枝和野花的彩牌楼。牌楼上挂起了“庆祝国庆”的匾额。在牌楼的另一面，战士们写上了他们对祖国人民的誓言：“守住它，祖国的大门。”
    这一天，阵地上出现了许多模型——有江南的稻田茅屋，也有华北古老的长城。这一天，阵地上到处三三两两在谈论着，谈论着祖国一年来的成就，谈论着自己的胜利。谈着谈着就唱起来了。唱“东方红……”，唱“我们的祖国多么辽阔广大……”，还有战士们自己编的歌：“我们从鸭绿江打过了清川江、大同江，多光荣啊！我们保卫了黄河、长江……。”这一天，到处充满了欢腾和喜悦。这一天，我们身在朝鲜前线，心早就和祖国人民在一起了。
    不几天以前，我们欢送在六一四高地用一挺机枪打死五十多个敌人、击落敌机一架的特等功臣战斗英雄代表关崇贵回祖国参加国庆节。连队里的战士们兴奋极了，围着他说长道短。曾在六一四高地上和关崇贵并肩作战的七班长卢金俊再三叮咛他：回到北京见了毛主席，可要替咱们问个好。转回时可千万带张毛主席最近的像片来。”和关崇贵在六一四高地一起作战的弹药手马克新要求他说：“上次祖国人民派了代表团慰问我们，这次你就代表我们吧，见了祖国人民可要多多慰问他们。他们的捐献运动，他们的建设成绩，都鼓舞着我们更奋勇地前进。”王克和邹小荣背着关崇贵提升为副排长以后移交给他俩的那挺机枪来了。他们说：“副排长，你放心回国去走一趟。我们使用你这挺机枪，打起仗来保证像你一样。”战士们都再三嘱咐他：“可要向祖国人民说明白呀！我们一定会给祖国人民争取更大的荣誉。”
