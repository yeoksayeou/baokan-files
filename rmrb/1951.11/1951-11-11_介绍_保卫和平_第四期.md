    Introducing "Defend Peace" Issue 4

    The fourth issue of "Defend Peace" magazine focuses on reporting the meetings and talks currently taking place between representatives of the world's two systems. The editorial by the magazine's president, Pierre Goite, provides a thorough analysis of the unfortunate consequences caused by the obstruction of current international economic relations by certain political decisions and measures, and the significance of the International Economic Conference to be held in Moscow early next year (a conference decided upon at the World Peace Council meeting held in Berlin this February). At this conference, hundreds of experts, economists, and industrialists from both Eastern and Western countries will gather to contribute their insights and perspectives. They will jointly discuss and research the most appropriate ways to improve current international economic relations and raise the living standards of people in all countries. Pablo Neruda's short article "Call to Convene a World Writers' Conference," Claude Morgan's report "Behind the Scenes of the Berlin Festival," Bodo Uhse, Chairman of the German Writers' Association's "Dialogue between East and West German Writers," and Soviet writer Nikolai Tikhonov's "Peace Relay Race" all discuss meetings between young people worldwide, meetings between writers, and meetings between the people of East and West Germany, respectively. Jack Macken's "Quaker's Victory for Peace" discusses the meeting between the British Quaker Society and the Soviet people. This issue also introduces a meeting that failed to materialize. In "The United Nations and Us" by Mrs. Blum, a member of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, the reasons are explained why the members of the World Peace Council, carrying the peace wishes of hundreds of millions of people around the world, were unable to meet with the members of the United Nations Security Council.

    In addition, this issue also publishes an article by Harold Davies, a member of the British House of Commons, entitled "Britain and the Japanese Peace Treaty," pointing out the threat to British industry from the United States' support of Japan. Pastor Oberhoff of Bremen, West Germany, wrote an article entitled "West German Remilitarization, the People Suffer First." Professor Pigal, former director of the office of the French Atomic Energy Commission, wrote "Can the Atomic Bomb Be Defended?" He pointed out that war-mongers must be forced to accept peace.

    This issue also publishes several sections from the first chapter of Ilya Ehrenburg's novel "The Ninth Wave" (a sequel to "The Storm"). There is also Bouchama's prose poem "Vault of Singing Clouds," and several articles introducing the different living conditions of people in various countries. One of them vividly introduces our country's "Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace." (Wu Xian)

    介绍“保卫和平”第四期
    “保卫和平”杂志第四期是以报道现在世界上两种制度的代表人物正在进行着的会晤和谈话为中心。该杂志社长皮尔·戈特所作的社论，对目前国际间的经济关系被一些政治的决定与措施所阻扰而引起的不幸的后果和明年年初将在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议（这一会议是世界和平理事会今年二月在柏林举行的会议上决定召开的）的重要意义作了周密的分析。这次会议上，将有几百个东西各国的专家、经济学家和工业家相聚一堂，贡献出他们的见解和观点。并且将共同讨论，研究出一些最适当的办法，以改善目前国际间的经济关系和提高各国人民的生活水平。巴勃罗·聂鲁达的短文“号召召开世界作家大会”、克罗德·摩尔岗的报道“柏林联欢节花絮”、德国作者协会主席包多·吴士的“东德与西德作家的对话”、苏联作家尼古拉·吉洪诺夫的“和平接力赛”等文，分别谈到了全世界青年的会晤、作家的会晤以及东德和西德的人民的会晤。加克·马肯辑写的“教友会为和平取得一个胜利”一文，说到了英国教友会与苏联人民的会晤。本期也介绍了一件未能实现的会晤，在世界和平理事会执行局委员布伦姆夫人的“联合国和我们”一文中，说明了带着全世界亿万人民的和平意愿的世界和平理事会的理事们，为什么未能与联合国安全理事会的理事们会晤的原因。
    此外，本期还刊出了英国下议院议员赫洛德·大卫斯的“英国与对日和约”一文，指出美国扶植日本对英国工业的威胁。西德不来梅地方的奥培霍夫牧师写了一篇文章——“西德重新军国主义化，人民首先遭殃”。前法国原子能总署办公厅主任皮加尔教授写了“原子弹可以防御么？”一文，他指出，必须强迫战争贩子接受和平。
    本期还发表了爱伦堡正在写的小说“海底洪涛”（“暴风雨”的续集）第一章里面的几节。还有布夏马的散文诗“歌云的穹顶”以及几篇介绍各国人民不同的生活情况的文章。其中一篇生动地介绍了我国的“北京市劳动人民文化宫”。（吴岘）
