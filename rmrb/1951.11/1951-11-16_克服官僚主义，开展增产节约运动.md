　　Overcome Bureaucratism, Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    CPC Fushun Municipal Committee
    The increase production and practice economy campaign in Fushun's state-owned enterprises has developed very unevenly. Apart from the Victory Mine West Well and six other units, most factories and mines have not yet turned the increase production and practice economy into a mass movement. The vast majority of factories and mines, after assigning the task figures to workshops or teams and groups, rarely pay attention to it afterwards. Some factories and mines focus their main efforts on controlling the issuance of materials and handling stagnant materials. Some have already "completed the task" or are about to "complete the task" without the workers even knowing. Some factories still adopt the method of apportionment to allocate tasks. The most typical example is the increase production and practice economy plan of the Open-Pit Mine's deep section. The plan stipulates: 40 percent should be completed from saving material costs, 40 percent from saving labor costs, and 20 percent from saving management fees. As a result, it was not completed in August, but instead wasted 140 tons of grain. In September, they instructed the workers again: each person should increase production and practice economy by 22.4 jin of grain per day. This left the workers baffled, picking up scrap iron and waste materials everywhere, which affected production. Some units, although they paid attention to exploiting production potential, did not believe in the creativity of the workers and only sat in the office, finding a technician to shut themselves up and review records, "looking for potential." After making a plan, they announced it by order, telling the workers to follow it, which naturally did not work.
    Why is this happening, and what is the basic reason?
    Is it because the cadres of some factories and mines are stronger, so the increase production and practice economy campaign is better developed, while the cadres of most other factories and mines are weaker, so the campaign is less developed? No. Several units where the movement has developed well, except for the power plant, are smaller factories and mines. Generally speaking, the capabilities of the cadres of these factories and mines are weaker than those of some large factories and mines.
    Is it because the increase production and practice economy campaign lacks clear guidelines and specific methods? Nor is it. At the beginning of September, the Municipal Party Committee held a cadre meeting, at which the guidelines and specific methods of increase production and practice economy were well resolved.
    The Municipal Party Committee believes that the basic reason lies in the serious bureaucratism in the leadership style. Not going deep into the masses, floating on the upper levels, abandoning leadership, this is not only the basic reason why the increase production and practice economy campaign cannot be carried out well, but also the key to hindering the improvement of various tasks. At present, the leadership methods of some enterprise departments have formed a set of stereotyped patterns: after the task is assigned, a factory-wide or workshop-wide workers' meeting is held, and the administrative leaders simply read out the tasks given by the higher authorities, or simply distribute the numbers, and think that they have fulfilled their leadership responsibilities. There is a lack of practical mobilization work, organizational work, and inspection work. Under the influence of this leadership style, technical personnel also do not go deep into the workshops and work with the workers to study how to exploit potential and solve specific problems. For example, the problems in the Victory Mine's safety inspection, most of those that workers could solve have been solved; but those submitted to the mine's technical personnel for resolution have remained untouched to this day. Workers have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, but no one studies them; correct ones are not implemented, and unreasonable ones are not answered. Therefore, when mobilizing the masses to put forward rationalization proposals this time, the workers first asked: "Will the opinions be dealt with if they are raised?"
    In order to further develop the increase production and practice economy campaign and do a good job in all other tasks, the CPC Fushun Municipal Committee has decided to take the following measures: First, use all its strength to overcome the bureaucratic work style of the party, administration, trade union, and youth league leadership in enterprises: on the one hand, make all cadres ideologically recognize the great significance of anti-bureaucratism; on the other hand, make organizational decisions, ordering the enterprise party committee to implement it. To this end, the following two points must be achieved: 1. Party and mass organizations cadres must go deep into the masses to carry out practical mobilization and organization work; 2. Administrative cadres, especially technical personnel, must go deep into the workshops to promptly handle workers' rationalization proposals, cooperate with workers to study problems, and solve specific problems. Second, use the experience of advanced enterprises to educate cadres, promptly criticize various deviations in the movement, and guide the movement in the right direction. Third, the main cadres of the CPC Fushun Municipal Committee will divide their work to grasp the main factories and mines, and effectively check, urge, and provide specific help to their work.

### 克服官僚主义，开展增产节约运动

　　克服官僚主义，开展增产节约运动
    中共抚顺市委会
    抚顺市国营企业的增产节约运动发展得很不平衡。除了胜利矿西井等七个单位外，多数厂矿尚未使增产节约形成群众性的运动。绝大多数厂矿把任务数字分配到车间或班、组以后，就很少再去过问了。有些厂矿把主要精力放在控制材料的发放与处理呆滞材料上，有的已“完成任务”或将要“完成任务”而工人还不知道。有的工厂仍旧采取摊派的方式分配任务。其中最典型的是露天矿深部车间的增产节约计划，该计划确定：从节约材料费中完成百分之四十，从人工费中节省百分之四十，从管理费中节约百分之二十。结果八月份没有完成，反而浪费了一百四十吨粮食。九月份他们又向工人布置：每人每天要增产节约二十二斤四两粮食。弄得工人莫名其妙，到处拣废铁废料，以致影响了生产。还有些单位虽然注意了发挥生产潜力，但是不相信工人群众的创造性，只坐在办公室里，找个技术人员关起门来查看记录，“找潜力”。他们在做出计划以后，就用命令公布，让工人照办，这自然行不通。
    为什么会造成这样的现象，基本原因在那里呢？
    是否因为某些厂矿干部强些，因而增产节约运动就开展得较好，而其余多数厂矿干部能力弱些，因而运动开展较差呢？不是。几个运动开展得较好的单位，除发电厂之外，都是较小的厂矿，一般说，这些厂矿的干部能力要比某些大厂矿的弱些。
    是否因为增产节约运动没有明确的方针以及具体办法呢？也不是。九月初市委曾召开了干部会，在会上把增产节约的方针和具体办法问题都已经很好地解决了。
    市委认为：基本原因在于领导作风上存在着严重的官僚主义。不深入群众，浮在上层，放弃领导，这不但是增产节约运动不能很好开展的基本原因，也是阻碍各种工作提高的关键。目前有些企业部门的领导方式已形成一套八股：任务布置下来以后，就召开一个全厂的或全车间的工人大会，行政领导同志照样把上级给的任务宣读一遍，或者把数字简单地分配一下，就以为是尽了领导的责任。缺乏切实的动员工作、组织工作和检查工作。在这种领导作风影响下，技术人员也不深入车间和工人一起研究怎样发挥潜力，解决具体问题。如胜利矿保安检查中的问题，工人可以解决的已大部解决；而提交矿上技术人员解决的至今原封未动。工人提出大批合理化建议，无人研究；正确的不实行，不合理的不答复。因此，这次发动群众提合理化建议时，工人首先问：“提了意见是不是处理？”
    中共抚顺市委为了进一步开展增产节约运动及作好其他一切工作，决定采取下列措施：第一，用一切力量克服企业的党、行政、工会、青年团领导上的官僚主义作风：一方面使所有干部在思想上认识反官僚主义的重大意义；一方面要作出组织决定，责成企业党委必须执行。为此，必须作到下面两条：一、党与群众团体的干部必须深入群众，进行切实的动员和组织工作；二、行政干部，特别是技术人员，必须深入车间及时处理工人的合理化建议，协同工人研究问题，解决具体问题。第二，用先进企业的经验教育干部，及时地批判运动中的各种偏向，把运动引向正确的方向。第三，中共抚顺市委主要干部分工抓住主要厂矿，对他们的工作要切实地检查、督促并予以具体帮助。
