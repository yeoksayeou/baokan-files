Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th -- At the subcommittee meeting on November 6th, our representative continued to refute the proposal put forward by the other side at the meeting on November 5th, pointing out that because the other side insisted on "adjusting" our Kaesong area under US occupation, the two sides did not reach any agreement on our proposed principle of strictly following the existing line of contact to make necessary adjustments to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. The other side's proposal to use an abstract principle that has not been agreed upon by both sides to avoid the discussion of the second item on the agenda and to enter the discussion of other items is a fundamental violation of the agenda agreed upon by both sides. The second item on the agenda clearly stipulates: "As a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea, determine the military demarcation line between the two sides in order to establish a demilitarized zone." The determination of a military demarcation line and the establishment of a demilitarized zone obviously cannot be replaced by any abstract principle that has not been agreed upon by both sides.

    Our representative solemnly pointed out that the other side's so-called new proposal is unacceptable. The other side said that the proposal was put forward to accelerate the ceasefire negotiations, but in fact, the other side's purpose in putting forward this proposal was only to avoid the discussion and resolution of the second item on the agenda, to delay the establishment of the basis for the ceasefire negotiations, and to make the entire ceasefire negotiations, even in the last five minutes, still likely to fail due to the other side's continued insistence on the unreasonable demand to occupy the Kaesong area. The other side attempts to use the excuse of making appropriate adjustments to the existing line of contact to cover up its unreasonable demand to occupy the Kaesong area. In order to expose the conspiracy in the other side's proposal, our representative once again pointed out that if the other side still believes that the reasonable adjustment proposed in our plan is unfavorable to the other side, we are fully prepared to consider taking the existing line of contact as the military demarcation line, with each side retreating two kilometers to establish a demilitarized zone, without making any adjustments. Abstract principles that have not been agreed upon by both sides can never replace the agreement between the two sides on the second item on the agenda as a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea. It is absolutely necessary to clearly and specifically determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th -- At the subcommittee meeting on the morning of November 5th, our representative sternly exposed the US side's deceptive claim that the US plan was based on appropriate adjustments to the existing line of contact, while on the other hand, it insisted on the unreasonable demand to occupy our Kaesong area. Our representative pointed out that only our plan is truly and strictly based on the existing line of contact, making the necessary and appropriate adjustments, while the other side's plan for the unreasonable demand to occupy the Kaesong area is completely contrary to the principle of strictly basing adjustments on the existing line of contact. Even the other side's representative had to admit at the subcommittee meeting that the other side's demand for the occupation of the Kaesong area was completely unrelated to the existing line of contact, and was an "exceptional situation," a "special situation." However, at the subcommittee meeting on the afternoon of November 5th, the other side proposed to report to the delegation plenary that the subcommittee had agreed that the determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone would be based on the line of contact at the time of the signing of the ceasefire agreement, with appropriate adjustments, and suggested to the delegation plenary that it enter into the discussion of other items on the agenda, leaving the second item on the agenda, the issue of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, for later discussion.

    Our representative repeatedly questioned whether the so-called appropriate adjustment by the other side included the unreasonable demand to occupy our Kaesong area, but the US representative consistently avoided answering directly. Our representative pointed out that according to the other side's consistent absurd argument, the unreasonable demand to occupy our Kaesong area is described as an appropriate adjustment, and the two sides have not reached any agreement on the principle of determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, so there is no way to report to the delegation plenary. For two days, in order to eliminate all excuses for the US side to repeatedly delay the ceasefire negotiations, we have clearly stated that if the US side believes that the fair and reasonable adjustment proposed in our plan is in any way unfavorable to it, and insists on the unreasonable demand to occupy our Kaesong, then we are fully prepared to consider each side retreating two kilometers from the line of contact, without making any adjustments at all. However, the US side has consistently avoided making any comment on this solemn proposal from our side, but at the subcommittee meeting on November 5th, it attempted to fundamentally overturn the agreed-upon agenda, postponing the issue of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, which is a basic condition for the ceasefire, until the final discussion, and attempting to repeat its old tricks during this period, undermining the Panmunjom agreement of October 22nd, in order to militarily invade the Kaesong neutral zone. If this goal cannot be achieved, then it can use the so-called "appropriate adjustment" as an excuse to continue to insist on its absurd demand to occupy our Kaesong area; otherwise, it will bring the entire ceasefire negotiations back to a standstill. But this deceptive trick will ultimately not be able to conceal the US side's responsibility for delaying or even attempting to sabotage the ceasefire negotiations in front of the people of the world.

    美方所谓新建议是要拖延停战谈判基础的建立
    我方代表严词揭穿对方阴谋
    并指出：明确而具体地确定军事分界线和非军事区是完全必要的。
    【新华社开城七日电】在十一月六日的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方在十一月五日会上提出的建议，指出由于对方坚持将我方开城地区“调整”到美方占领之下，双方对于我方提出的严格按照现有接触线作必要调整以确定军事分界线与非军事地区的原则，并未达成任何协议。对方建议以一个双方并未同意的抽象原则，来避免第二项议程的讨论，而进入其他各项议程的讨论，是根本违反了双方同意的议程的规定的。议程中的第二项，明确规定：“作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件，确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事地区”。确定军事分界线和建立非军事地区显然不是任何未经双方同意的抽象原则所能予以代替的。
    我方代表郑重指出对方的所谓新建议是不能接受的。对方说这个建议的提出是为了加速停战谈判的进行，其实对方提出这个建议的目的，只是为避开第二项议程的讨论和解决，拖延停战谈判的基础的建立，使整个停战谈判即在最后五分钟也还完全有可能为对方继续坚持占有开城地区的无理要求而濒于失败。对方企图以对现有接触线作适当调整为借口，掩盖其占有开城地区的无理要求。为揭穿对方建议中的阴谋，我方代表再度指出：如对方仍然认为我方方案中所建议的合理调整为对对方不利，我方完全准备考虑以现有接触线为军事分界线双方各退二公里，以建立非军事区，而不作任何调整。未经双方同意的抽象原则，绝不能代替双方对第二项议程的协议，作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件。明确而具体地确定军事分界线和非军事区是完全必要的。
    【新华社开城五日电】在十一月五日上午的小组委员会上，我方代表严词揭穿了美方一方面坚持占领我方开城地区的无理要求，而另一方面又诡称美方方案是以现有接触线为基础作适当调整的欺骗。我方代表指出：只有我方的方案才是名符其实地严格地以现有接触线为基础作必要的适当调整的方案，而对方方案对于占领开城地区的无理要求，是和严格以现有接触线为基础作必要调整的原则完全相反的。即使对方代表在小组会上也曾不得不承认对方对于占领开城地区的要求，是与现有接触线完全无关的，是“例外的情形”，“特殊的情形”。但是在十一月五日下午的小组会上，对方却又提议向代表团大会报告小组会已经同意军事分界线与非军事地区的确定，将根据停战协议签字时的接触线作适当调整的原则，并向代表团大会建议进入议程上其他各项的讨论，而将第二项议程即军事分界线及非军事地区的问题，留待以后讨论。
    我方代表再三质问对方所谓适当调整，是否即系包括占领我方开城地区的无理要求，但美方代表却始终避免正面答复。我方代表指出：根据对方一贯的荒谬论调，将占领我方开城地区的无理要求说成是适当的调整，双方对于确定军事分界线与非军事地区的原则根本没有达成任何协议，因此也无从向代表团大会作任何报告。两日以来，我方为了解除美方一再拖延停战谈判的一切藉口，明确地声明：如果美方认为我方方案所建议的公平合理的调整，对它有任何不利之处，而坚持占领我方开城的无理要求，则我方完全准备考虑双方各自接触线后撤二公里，根本不作任何调整。但是，美方对于我方这一严正建议，始终避免作任何评论，却在十一月五日的小组会上企图根本推翻早经协议的议事日程，将作为停战的基本条件的军事分界线问题和非军事区问题推迟到最后讨论，并妄想在这一时期重施故技，破坏十月二十二日板门店协议，好从军事上侵犯开城中立区，如果达不到这个目的，则又可藉口所谓“适当调整”，继续坚持其占领我方开城地区的荒谬要求；不然，就使整个停战谈判重归停顿。但这种欺骗伎俩，将终不能在全世界人民面前掩饰美方拖延乃至企图破坏停战谈判的责任。
