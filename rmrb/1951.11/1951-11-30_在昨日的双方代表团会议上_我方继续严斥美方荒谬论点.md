    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 29th. At the meeting of both delegations for the Korean armistice negotiations on the 29th, our side's representatives continued to sternly refute the absurd arguments put forward by the other side regarding maintaining the status quo of military strength at the time of signing the armistice agreement to ensure that hostilities would not recur; as well as the unreasonable demands for supervisory bodies to have free access to the entire territory of Korea. Our representatives reiterated: In order to truly ensure that hostilities would not occur after the Korean armistice, the state of war in Korea must be completely eliminated, rather than maintaining a military balance under the state of war; the military forces of both sides should be actively reduced, and all foreign troops and their supplies and equipment should be withdrawn from Korea, rather than proactively using the so-called method of replenishment and rotation to maintain the level of military strength of both sides at the time of signing the armistice agreement. However, the other side has consistently opposed discussing the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, claiming that it has no right to discuss the issue of the presence or absence of foreign troops in Korea during the armistice negotiations. Our representative questioned that if the other side has no right to discuss the issue of the presence or absence of foreign troops in Korea, how can the other side have the right to discuss the replenishment and rotation of foreign troops after the signing of the armistice agreement. Our representatives reiterated that our five-point principle proposal for the third agenda item is a sufficient and reasonable solution to the third agenda item, and demanded that the other side give it serious consideration.

    在昨日的双方代表团会议上
    我方继续严斥美方荒谬论点
    【新华社开城二十九日电】二十九日的朝鲜停战谈判的双方代表团会议上，我方代表继续严词驳斥对方所提出的维持停战协议签字时的军事力量的现状，以保证敌对行为不再复发的荒谬论点；以及监督机构得以自由出入朝鲜全境的无理要求。我方代表再度指出：为了真正地保证朝鲜停战后敌对行为不再发生，就必须彻底消除朝鲜的战争状态，而不是保持战争状态下的军事平衡；就应该积极减少双方的军事力量，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队及其供给与装备，而不是主动地使用所谓补充和轮换的方法来维持双方在停战协议签字时的军事力量的水平。但对方却又始终反对讨论自朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的问题，声称：在从事停战谈判中，无权讨论外国军队撤出的问题。我方代表质问如果对方无权讨论外国军队在朝鲜的去留的问题，何以对方却又有权讨论外国军队在停战协议签字后的补充与轮换的问题。我方代表再度指出：我方对于第三项议程的五项原则建议是解决第三项议程的充分而合理的方案，要求对方予以郑重的考虑。
