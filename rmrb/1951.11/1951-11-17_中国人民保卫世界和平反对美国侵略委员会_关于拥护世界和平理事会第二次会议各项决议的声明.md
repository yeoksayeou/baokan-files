The Second Session of the World Peace Council, which began in Vienna on November 1st, successfully concluded on the 7th. The session adopted eight resolutions and a letter to the United Nations and the people of all countries. Based on the fact that more than 562 million people worldwide have signed the Peace Pact Declaration, the World Peace Council session called on the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, to hold negotiations and conclude a peace pact that all countries could join. The session called on the five major powers, which have the largest military equipment and are responsible for safeguarding world peace under the United Nations Charter, to conclude a disarmament treaty. This treaty must stipulate the absolute prohibition of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, and provide for the simultaneous, gradual, and supervised reduction of armed forces and armaments. The session called on China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to re-negotiate the Japanese peace treaty, and at the same time called on all those who support peace in the Asia and Pacific region, including the Japanese people, to hold a regional conference to defend peace as soon as possible, so that the Japanese issue can be resolved peacefully. The session pointed out that from the standpoint of justice and international policy reality, the government of the People's Republic of China must be allowed to join the United Nations. The session called on all parties engaged in hostilities in Korea to reach an agreement as soon as possible to end the hostilities and make a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue possible. The session called for an immediate ceasefire in Vietnam and negotiations to find a comprehensive solution to the conflict, which should stipulate the withdrawal of foreign troops. Conflicts in Burma, the Philippines, Malaya and other places should also be resolved according to the same principle. The session called for effective recognition of the rights of the people of Egypt, Iran, Morocco, and all other countries in the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa to conduct and manage their own affairs without oppression, interference, or military occupation, and for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt and Sudan. The session called on the people of all countries to take action to ensure that the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France hold a conference and conclude a peace treaty with a demilitarized, unified, and peace-loving Germany that can guarantee peace in Europe. The session called for the development of cultural exchanges between the people of all countries, the use of the 1952 holidays to serve peace, and the holding of a great cultural anniversary to commemorate immortal figures such as French writer Hugo, Italian painter Vinci, Russian writer Gogol, and famous Arab doctor Avicenna.

　　The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression believes that the resolutions and proposals in the letter to the United Nations and the people of all countries of the current session of the World Peace Council fully conform to the peace aspirations of the Chinese people, and therefore decides to accept them all and firmly support them.

　　The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression calls on all people's organizations and the people of the whole country to unite as one, and to unite with the people of all countries, to strive to realize the decisions of the current session of the World Peace Council, and first of all to strive to achieve a peaceful and just solution to the Korean issue, the Japanese issue, and other important issues in the Far East, Asia, and North Africa. In order to achieve this goal, the people of the whole country must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and carry on the struggle to resist America and aid Korea until a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue is achieved.

　　The national media and all propaganda, education, and cultural institutions should take effective measures to widely publicize the action program for defending world peace formulated by the current session of the World Peace Council to the masses of the people, and call on the people of the whole country to continue to advance towards the victory of the struggle against aggression, towards the victory of building our great country, and towards the victory of defending lasting world peace.
