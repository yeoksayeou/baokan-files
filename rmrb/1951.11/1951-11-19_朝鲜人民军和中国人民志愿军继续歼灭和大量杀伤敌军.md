Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in recent fierce counter-attacks and blocking battles, have continued to annihilate and inflict heavy casualties on the enemy.

    On the Western and Central fronts, our army launched a series of counter-attacks before the 6th, annihilating many enemy companies and battalions, and recovering many positions. On the night of the 7th, a unit of our army continued to counter-attack the enemy occupying Heights 424.2, 500, 690.1, etc., southwest and southeast of Kimhwa, with rapid and courageous combat actions, annihilating more than 600 enemy soldiers in one fell swoop. This included the 4th Company of the 21st Regiment and two entire platoons of the 19th Regiment of the US 24th Division. On the 10th, two battalions of the enemy attacked our positions along the line of Mukgwan-dong North Mountain and Hageolli North Mountain, north of Yeoncheon. However, under the combined attack of our army's fierce artillery fire and infantry, the enemy's repeated assaults were repelled. The enemy suffered more than 470 casualties.
    On the Eastern Front, the enemy constantly advanced towards areas northwest and southeast of Mundung-ri, north of Gachilbong, north of Seohui Ridge, and southwest of Goseong with forces ranging from several companies to several battalions, but all were met with strong resistance and counter-attacks from our army. In the areas northwest and southeast of Mundung-ri, a unit of our army fired fierce artillery and bullets at two advancing battalions of the American invading army, preventing the enemy from advancing an inch and killing or wounding more than 250 enemy soldiers. On the 5th, four companies of the enemy attacked Height 201 southwest of Goseong. Our army fought fiercely with the enemy in this area for ten hours, killing or wounding more than 500 enemies, and then actively withdrew from the area. By the night of the 7th, a unit of our army suddenly launched a counter-attack on the enemy entrenched in the area, and after more than two hours of fierce fighting, killed or wounded more than 130 enemy soldiers, and the position returned to our hands.

    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在最近猛烈的反击战和阻击战中，继续歼灭和大量杀伤敌军。
    在西线和中线，我军曾在六日以前发起一连串的反击，歼灭了许多成营成连的敌军，并收复了不少阵地。七日夜间，我军某部继续以迅速、勇猛的战斗动作，分别反击侵占金城西南和东南的四二四点二、五零零、六九零点一等高地的敌人，一举歼灭了六百多名敌军。其中包括美军第二十四师第二十一团的第四连和第十九团的两个整排。十日，敌军两个营向我涟川以北牧馆洞北山、下真里北山等一线阵地进攻，但在我军猛烈炮火和步兵的联合打击下，敌军多次猛攻均被击退。敌军伤亡四百七十多名。
    在东线，敌军不断以数个连到数个营的兵力，向文登里西北和东南、加七峰以北、西希岭以北及高城西南等处进犯，也都遭到我军坚强的阻击和反击。在文登里西北和东南地区，我军某部向进犯的美国侵略军两个营发射猛烈的炮火和枪弹，使敌军寸步不能前进，并杀伤敌二百五十多人。五日，敌军四个连向高城西南二零一高地进攻。我军在该地与敌人激战十小时，杀伤敌人五百多名后，主动撤出该地。至七日夜间，我军一部突向盘踞该地的敌军发起反击，经两小时余的激战。杀伤敌军一百三十多名，该处阵地又重归我手。
