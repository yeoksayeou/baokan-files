In order to thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants and reform the mule and horse trading system, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce issued an announcement on November 5, declaring the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in the mule and horse industry, the establishment of new mule and horse trading markets, and simultaneously promulgated the Provisional Rules for the Management of Mule and Horse Trading Markets in Beijing.

The announcement pointed out: The existing horse shops and "loubao" (speculators who manipulate prices) in places such as Deshengmenwai, Beijing, have continued the feudal malpractices and bad habits of the past, engaging in "loubao" activities, concealing prices and eating price differences, forging ages, and concealing illnesses and injuries in transactions. Among them, there are also some special agents and local bullies who have always colluded with the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang reactionary forces, monopolizing the market, arbitrarily oppressing the masses, seriously harming the interests of mule and horse merchants, and hindering the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

The announcement continued: In order to thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, reform the mule and horse trading system, and develop urban-rural exchange, the "Provisional Rules for the Management of Mule and Horse Trading Markets in Beijing" are hereby formulated and promulgated for implementation. From now on, anyone buying or selling mules and horses, opening horse shops or mule and horse inns, must strictly follow these rules.

The rules stipulate: Mule and horse transactions must be conducted in the mule and horse trading market, with buyers and sellers directly concluding transactions or entrusting traders to introduce transactions, and prices freely negotiated between buyers and sellers. "Loubao" activities are strictly prohibited. Horse shops are only allowed to engage in the purchase and sale of mules and horses, and are not allowed to accommodate mule and horse merchants and their mules and horses or buy and sell on behalf of customers. Mule and horse inns are exclusively for accommodating mule and horse merchants and their mules and horses. Market traders are responsible for introducing transactions, identifying livestock, and collecting taxes on behalf of the government. They are not allowed to collect any fees other than the handling fees extracted from the transaction tax collected on behalf of the government in accordance with regulations. When trading, sellers should submit the transaction tax receipts from the original purchase or certificates from district, village governments, agencies, or military units, and guarantee the age and health of the mules and horses sold, and must not conceal or deceive. Those entering the market for transactions must not use slang or codes to conclude transactions, and should maintain public hygiene and order in the market. Mules and horses suffering from infectious diseases are not allowed to enter the market. Those who violate the rules in conducting mule and horse transactions will be given administrative sanctions depending on the severity of the circumstances, or sent to the People's Court for handling in accordance with the law.

    北京市人民政府工商局发出布告
    废除骡马业的封建把持制度

    布告指出：北京市德胜门外等处现有的马店和搂包，沿袭过去封建的恶习陋规，在交易中进行搂包及瞒价吃价，伪造年齿，掩饰病伤等欺诈行为。其中，并有一部分特务恶霸，一贯勾结日伪及国民党反动势力，把持市场，任意欺压群众，严重地损害骡马客商利益，妨碍城乡物资交流。
    布告继指出：为彻底肃清封建残余，坚决镇压反革命，改革骡马交易制度，发展城乡交流，特制定“北京市骡马交易市场管理暂行规则”公布施行。今后，凡买卖骡马，开设马店或骡马客店者，均须依照规则切实办理。
    规则中规定：骡马交易必须在骡马交易市场进行，买卖双方直接成交或委托交易员介绍成交，价格由买卖双方自由议定。严禁搂包活动。马店只限经营购销骡马业务，不得留宿骡马客商及其骡马或代客买卖，骡马客店专营留宿骡马客商及其骡马的业务。市场交易员负责介绍交易、鉴别牲畜，并代征税款，除由代征交易税中依规定提取手续费外，不得收取任何费用。卖主于交易时，应缴验原购入时的交易税票或区、村政府、机关、部队的证明，并对所出售骡马的年齿、健康情况提出保证，不得瞒骗。入场交易者均不得用黑话、暗码成交，并应保持市场的公共卫生和秩序。凡患有传染性疫病的骡马不得进入市场。进行骡马交易者如违反规则，依其情节轻重酌予行政处分，或送人民法院依法处理。
