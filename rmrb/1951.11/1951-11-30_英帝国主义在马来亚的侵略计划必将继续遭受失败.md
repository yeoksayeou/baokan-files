    British imperialism's executioner of colonial policies in Southeast Asia, MacDonald, recently admitted in Rangoon that Britain's "situation in Malaya is more serious than at any time in the past three years." Lister, a former Colonial Under-Secretary in the British Labour government, also stated in the British House of Lords this month that the British army had "not only failed to defeat them, but also failed to drive them out of any state in the (Malayan) Federation" with respect to the Malayan National Liberation Army. This helpless confession by the British ruling class fully reflects that their situation in Malaya is deteriorating.

    Malaya is one of British imperialism's important colonies in Southeast Asia. The rubber produced in Malaya has always been a source of wealth for British monopoly capitalists. In order to suppress the Malayan people's national liberation movement, consolidate its colonial rule in Malaya, and maintain its aggressive interests, British imperialism has implemented the so-called "Emergency Regulations" since June 1948, and after June last year, it implemented a bloody suppression plan named after Briggs, the executioner who massacred the Malayan people. However, British imperialism's terroristic suppression measures have continuously suffered disgraceful failures due to the heroic resistance of the Malayan people.

    Now, the British Conservative government is facing a very serious economic crisis under the heavy burden of military expenditure. However, it still continues to pursue its aggressive policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war and suppressing the liberation movements of the colonial people, regardless of the people's strong opposition and the disgraceful failures suffered in the colonies. Shortly after Churchill came to power, he sent his Colonial Secretary Lyttelton to Malaya to plot a new armed attack on the Malayan people. However, the facts of the past three and a half years have fully proved that the Malayan people's will and strength to oppose imperialist plunder and aggression can never be destroyed by any "Briggs Plan" or "vampire" airplanes. The flames of the Malayan national liberation movement will burn more fiercely, causing all the aggressive plans of the British imperialist colonists to be completely destroyed.

    英帝国主义在马来亚的侵略计划必将继续遭受失败
    英帝国主义在东南亚的殖民政策的执行人麦克唐纳，最近在仰光承认：英国在马来亚的“局势比过去三年中任何时候都要严重。”曾任英国工党政府殖民副大臣的李斯多威尔，也于本月中在英国上议院发言时声称：英国军队对于马来亚民族解放军“不仅未能把他们打败，也未能把他们从（马来亚）联邦任何一州驱逐出去。”英国统治阶级这种无可奈何的招供，充分反映了他们在马来亚的处境是愈来愈恶化了。
    马来亚是英帝国主义在东南亚的重要的殖民地之一。马来亚所盛产的橡胶，一向是英国独占资本家致富的源泉。为了镇压马来亚人民的民族解放运动，以巩固其在马来亚的殖民地统治并保持其侵略利益，英帝国主义从一九四八年六月起实行了所谓“紧急法令”，去年六月以后又实行了以屠杀马来亚人民的刽子手布里格斯为名的血腥镇压计划。但是，英帝国主义的这种恐怖的镇压手段，由于马来亚人民的英勇抵抗而连续遭受到了可耻的失败。
    现在，英国保守党政府在沉重的军费负担下正面临着十分严重的经济危机，然而它依然不顾人民的强烈反对和在殖民地所遭受到的可耻失败，继续推行其扩军备战和镇压殖民地人民解放运动的侵略政策。邱吉尔在上台不久以后，就派出了他的殖民大臣里特尔顿前往马来亚，以策划对马来亚人民发动新的武装进攻。但是，三年半以来的事实已经充分地证明：马来亚人民反对帝国主义掠夺与侵略的意志和力量，绝不是什么“布里格斯计划”或“吸血鬼”式飞机所能摧毁的。马来亚民族解放运动的怒火，将会更炽烈地燃烧起来，使英帝国主义殖民者的一切侵略计划都遭到彻底的毁灭。
