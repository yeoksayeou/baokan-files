Propaganda Network Work in Beijing State-Owned Enterprises
　　Yu Heng, Xing Jun

　　The 21 state-owned factories and mining enterprises in Beijing now have 2,046 propagandists. Working closely with 62 reporters, they control various mass propaganda organizations with over 6,300 workers participating: broadcasting groups, reading groups, art groups, etc., forming a powerful propaganda force. This has completely changed the past situation where only a few people did propaganda work. For example, in the Changxindian Railway Factory, on average, one in every four people is a propaganda worker. Here, the masses can often hear the propagandists' speeches, thus having a certain understanding of the current situation, the people's government's policies and tasks. Due to the establishment of the propaganda network, the Party organizations in various factories and mining enterprises now have the strength to conduct propaganda work among the workers' families. In the process of work, the propagandists' abilities have gradually improved, and the work system of the propaganda network has also become increasingly sound.

　　In various campaigns, the propaganda network of each factory and mining enterprise has played a significant role. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, thanks to the efforts of the propagandists, the workers of each factory and mining enterprise generally received patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and their class consciousness was greatly improved. On this basis, patriotic pledges were made, and patriotic production increase and donation campaigns were launched. When promoting advanced working methods, the propagandists promptly overcame various ideological obstacles, allowing the work to proceed smoothly. For example, when the Changxindian Railway Factory began to promote the "high-speed cutting method," many workers expressed a lack of confidence. Some said: "Our machines can't implement the 'high-speed cutting method'!" After the propagandists' publicity and explanation, this thinking of some workers was changed, and everyone's enthusiasm for learning and using the "high-speed cutting method" rose, and work efficiency was greatly improved. For example, as a result of adopting the "high-speed cutting method" in the Bai Heling workshop of the Machinery Factory, the work efficiency of turning "large hook pins" increased by 900%. After listening to the propagandists' introduction of advanced work experience, the workers of the Telegraph Office of the Telecommunications Bureau improved their working methods, saving the country more than 500 million yuan in July alone.

　　In the nearly one year since the establishment of the propaganda network, the Party committees of various state-owned factories and mines have cultivated a group of outstanding propagandists who have completed the various propaganda tasks assigned by the Party in each period. They all have high prestige among the masses. The masses generally reflect: "With propagandists, we know a lot more, and there is communication between the top and bottom." Xie Pei (worker), a propagandist from the People's Printing Factory, is one of the outstanding propagandists. He can conduct propaganda in simple, easy-to-understand language that suits the masses' tastes, targeting their ideological situation. Gao Yanchang (repair department worker), a propagandist from the Beijing Machine Factory, used allegro and crosstalk to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda among the factory's workers during the Resist America, Aid Korea and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, promoting patriotic production competition.

　　The establishment of the Party's propaganda network has also enabled many leading cadres who serve as propagandists to learn the style of "discussing matters with the masses." He Shanji, head of the Transportation Yard of the Shijingshan Power Plant, is one of them. He said: "Since I became a propagandist, I have understood that I must explain the principles to everyone before doing things. My commandism style has been overcome, my relationship with the masses has become closer, and at the same time, because I have to do propaganda for everyone, my study time has also increased a lot."

　　Although the propaganda network work of various state-owned factories and mining enterprises in Beijing has achieved certain results, there are still many problems. For example, many units have not yet established a complete system for leading the propaganda network; the Party committees of some factories are still very weak in their leadership of the propaganda network. They only conducted a special discussion on this work when they first established the propaganda network, and later only mentioned it incidentally when discussing other work. As a result, the propaganda work of some enterprises gradually became a mere formality. The propaganda content of some propagandists lacks political correctness and even has obvious errors, and it has not been corrected in time. For example, some propagandists once said when promoting production competitions: "Getting bonuses is profit, getting red flags is fame, and winning the competition brings both fame and fortune." Such propaganda is obviously contrary to the Party's policy. The existence of the above shortcomings is mainly because the Party committees of various factories and mining enterprises have not fully understood the spirit and essence of the Central Committee's decision on establishing the propaganda network, thus abandoning or relaxing their leadership over the propagandists. This phenomenon must be corrected. To this end, Party committees at all levels should immediately establish and improve various necessary systems for the propaganda network; at the same time, it is also necessary to further closely coordinate the various components of the propaganda network to work together. Only in this way can we advance the Party's propaganda network work.

### 北京市国营企业中的宣传网工作

　　北京市国营企业中的宣传网工作
    俞衡  邢军
    北京市的二十一个国营厂、矿企业现有宣传员二千零四十六名，他们与六十二名报告员密切配合，掌握了有六千三百多名职工参加的各种群众性的宣传组织：广播组、读报组、美术组等，组成一支强大的宣传队伍，经常向工人群众进行宣传工作，完全改变了过去只有少数人作宣传工作的状况。例如长辛店铁路工厂平均每四人中就有一个宣传工作者。在这里，群众可以经常听到宣传员的讲话，因而对目前的时局、人民政府的政策和任务，都有了一定程度的了解。由于宣传网的建立，各厂矿企业的党组织，已经有力量向工人家属进行宣传工作。在工作过程中，宣传员的能力已逐步提高，宣传网的工作制度也日益健全。
    在各项运动中，各厂矿企业的宣传网发挥了很大的作用。抗美援朝运动展开后，由于宣传员的努力，各厂矿企业的职工，普遍受到了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，阶级觉悟大大提高；并在这一基础上订立了爱国公约，展开了爱国增产捐献运动。在推广先进工作方法时，宣传员及时克服了各种思想障碍，使工作得以顺利进行。例如长辛店铁路工厂开始推行“高速切削法”时，许多职工表示没有信心。有人说：“咱们这样的机器是没法实行‘高速切削法’的！”经过宣传员的宣传解释，改变了一部分职工的这种思想，大家学习使用“高速切削法”的情绪高涨起来，工作效率大大提高。例如机械厂白鹤龄车间采用“高速切削法”的结果，旋“大钩削”的工作效率提高了百分之九百。电信局电报处的工人们听了宣传员关于先进工作经验的介绍以后，改进了自己的工作方法，仅七月份一个月就为国家节省了五亿多元。
    在宣传网建立的将近一年的过程中，各国营厂矿的党委已经培养了一批优秀的宣传员，他们完成了党在每一时期所交给的各项宣传任务。他们在群众中都有较高的威信。群众普遍地反映：“有了宣传员，知道的事情可多了，上下也通气了。”人民印刷厂宣传员谢沛（工人）是优秀的宣传员之一，他能够针对群众的思想情况，用通俗易懂、切合群众口胃的语言进行宣传。北京机器厂宣传员高延昌（修理部工人）在抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动中利用快板、相声向全厂工友进行了广泛深入的宣传，推动了爱国生产竞赛。
    党的宣传网的建立，也使许多担任宣传员的领导干部学会了“有事和群众商量”的作风。石景山发电厂运输场主任何善基就是其中的一个。他说：“自从我作了宣传员以后，就懂得了办事先要向大家讲清道理。我的命令主义作风克服了，和群众的关系密切了，同时因为要向大家作宣传，我的学习时间也增加了不少。”
    北京市各国营厂、矿企业的宣传网工作虽然已经获得一定的成绩，但还存在着不少问题。例如：还有很多单位没有建立起一套完整的领导宣传网的制度；有些工厂的党委对宣传网的领导还是很弱的，他们只是在开始建立宣传网时对这一工作作过一次专门讨论，以后只是在讨论其它工作时附带提一提。结果有些企业的宣传工作，就逐渐流于形式。有些宣传员的宣传内容缺乏政治性，甚至有着明显的错误，也没有得到及时纠正。如有的宣传员在宣传生产竞赛时即曾说：“得奖金是利，得红旗是名，竞赛优胜名利双收。”这样的宣传显然是违背党的政策的。以上缺点的存在，主要是因为各厂、矿企业的党委对于中央关于建立宣传网决定的精神与实质还领会得不够，因而放弃或放松了对宣传员的领导。这种现象是必须纠正的。为此，各级党委应立即建立与健全宣传网的各种必要的制度；同时，还须进一步使宣传网的各个组成部分密切配合起来，共同进行工作。只有这样，才能把党的宣传网工作向前推进一步。
