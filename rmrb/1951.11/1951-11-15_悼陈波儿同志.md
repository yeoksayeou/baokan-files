In Memory of Comrade Chen Bo'er
　　Cai Chusheng

　　Comrade Chen Bo'er was an advanced revolutionary among Chinese drama and film workers, an excellent member of the Chinese Communist Party and a good student of Chairman Mao, and also one of the diligent founders of the young Chinese people's film industry.

　　As early as after the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War, when the White Terror was at its height, Comrade Bo'er participated in left-wing drama activities in Shanghai, engaging in the pioneering work of progressive drama art. From then until she breathed her last, she devoted her life's energy to drama and film work to educate the people and inspire them to rise up in revolution and seek liberation. The film "Song of the Peach and Plum" in which she starred, reflected the serious national crisis created by the reactionary rulers at that time, and the miserable situation of the people across the country living in poverty. It actively encouraged young people to rise up and fight, and therefore won enthusiastic support from the audience and had a good social impact. Comrade Bo'er's progressive film and drama activities in her early years laid the foundation for her artistic career in later periods.

　　In 1946, despite being ill, she participated in the founding work of the Northeast Film Studio. During this period, because the war was still going on fiercely, and it was not easy to carry out work in the midst of constant relocation and extremely difficult material conditions. However, Comrade Bo'er did not bow her head in the face of difficulties. She and her comrades, under extremely difficult circumstances, finally established the production work of the Northeast Film Studio, and gradually developed it, and trained a large number of new workers.

　　In 1949, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government was established, and she served as the Deputy Director of the Art Committee and the Director of the Art Department. Because the people's film industry was still in the initial stage of comprehensive development, due to the lack of cadres, and because a large number of production tasks had to be undertaken immediately—twenty-six feature films and many large, medium, and small news documentaries—this huge creative organization work largely fell on her shoulders. She worked day and night, and her efforts enabled us to gloriously overfulfill the production plan for 1950. Her health was originally not good, and this caused even greater damage to her health.

　　She deserves to be an excellent member of the Chinese Communist Party and a good student of Chairman Mao. She has the noble character of a Bolshevik and strong love and hatred. She has consistently adhered to Chairman Mao's direction that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. She is good at grasping the principled and policy-related aspects of problems. Although her physical strength was not good, no matter how heavy the work was, she never complained. She showed a high degree of responsibility to people and things. Many comrades have received her help and encouragement in their work, and have therefore achieved considerable success. The correct and good performance of the young Chinese people's film industry in creation is largely due to her tireless efforts over the years. Comrades, seeing that her health was getting worse and worse, had advised her to take a rest, but driven by her sense of responsibility, she always worked while ill, working non-stop.

　　Now, she is forever separated from us! She worked for the Chinese people's film industry until the end and finally dedicated her life to it. Her unfortunate death is a huge loss to the Chinese people's film industry, an irreparable loss!

　　The workers of the Chinese people's film industry are proud of her brilliant achievements in her work during her lifetime, and express infinite grief and mourning that she left us at such a young age when her future was limitless! We must learn from her selfless working spirit, learn from her responsible working attitude towards the country, the Party, and the people, and take on the work and unfulfilled aspirations that she did not complete, and do the work even better.

　　Comrade Bo'er: You have done your best, you have completed your task, your spirit will always inspire us and push us forward to victory!

　　Comrade Bo'er: May you rest in peace!

　　悼陈波儿同志
    蔡楚生
    陈波儿同志是中国戏剧电影工作者中先进的革命者，是中国共产党优秀的党员和毛主席的好学生，也是年青的中国人民电影事业辛勤的奠基工作者之
    一。
    远在第一次国内革命战争失败以后，白色恐怖正极厉害的时候，波儿同志就在上海参加了左翼的戏剧活动，从事进步的戏剧艺术的拓荒工作。从那时起，直到她停止最后的呼吸为止，她把毕生的精力都用在为教育人民和鼓舞人民起来革命、起来求得解放的戏剧电影工作上面。她所主演的“桃李劫”，反映了当时反动的统治者所造成的严重的民族危机，和全国民不聊生，悲惨万状的局面，并积极地鼓舞青年们起来斗争，因而获得了观众热烈的拥护，起了很好的社会影响。波儿同志早年进步的电影戏剧活动，给她此后各个时期的艺术事业打下了基础。
    一九四六年，她抱病参加东北电影制片厂的创建工作。这个时期因为战争还在激烈地进行着，在辗转播迁和物质条件备感困难中，欲展开工作是一件不容易的事情，但波儿同志并没有在困难的面前低头，她和同志们在极度艰苦的情形下，终于使东北电影制片厂的制片工作建立起来，而且逐步地得到发展，和训练了大批新的工作者。
    一九四九年中央人民政府文化部电影局成立，她担任艺术委员会副主任委员兼艺术处处长的工作。由于人民的电影事业还在全面发展的最初阶段，由于干部的缺乏，由于立刻就要承担起大量的生产任务——二十六部故事片和许多大、中、小型的新闻纪录片，这庞大的创作上的组织工作就大部分落在她的肩膀上。她日以继夜地从事工作，由于她的努力，使我们一九五○年的生产计划能够光荣地超额完成了任务。她的身体原来就不好，也因此使她的健康受到了更大的损害。
    她不愧为中国共产党一个优秀的党员和毛主席的好学生。她有着布尔什维克者高贵的品格和强烈的爱憎，她一贯地坚持毛主席文艺要为工农兵服务的方向，她对问题善于作原则性和政策性的掌握；虽然她的体力很不好，但无论工作如何繁重，她从不叫苦，她对人对事，都表现了高度的负责精神，许多同志们在工作上都受过她的帮助和鼓励，因而获得了不少成就。年青的中国人民电影事业在创作上之所以有着正确的良好的表现，她几年来辛勤不息的努力是起着很大的作用的。同志们因她的体健越来越不好，都曾劝她稍作休息，但她为责任心所驱策，总是带病工作着，不停地工作着。
    现在，她是和我们永别了！她是为中国人民的电影事业工作到最后终于献出她的生命的。她的不幸病逝，是中国人民的电影事业巨大的损失，无可补偿的损失！
    中国人民电影事业的工作者，为她生前在工作上所表现的光辉的成就感到骄傲，为她正是前途无量、而在这样年轻就离开我们，表示无限的沉痛与哀悼！我们一定要学习她那种忘我的工作精神，学习她那种对国家、对党、对人民负责的工作态度，把她未完成的工作，未完成的志愿，很好地担负起来，把工作做得更好。
    波儿同志：你已经尽了你最大的努力，你已经完成了你的任务，你的精神将永远鼓舞着我们，推动着我们胜利前进！
    波儿同志：愿你安息吧！
