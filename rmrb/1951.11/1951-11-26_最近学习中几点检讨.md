    Some Self-Criticisms in Recent Study
    Professor of Western Languages Department, Peking University Zhu Guangqian
    In the recent two months of teacher training, I re-examined my thinking and found it riddled with holes. The root causes lie in feudal consciousness and Western education.

    The deepest root is feudal consciousness. I used to classify myself as a petty bourgeois, which was a dishonest way to absolve myself. For more than two generations, my family belonged to the landlord class. It was not until my grandfather's generation that we declined into the petty bourgeoisie. My grandfather and father both made a living by teaching. However, in my father's later years, the family had some savings and bought some land, becoming landlords again. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, my wife also used some savings to buy land near her family's home in Sichuan. Therefore, my landlord status is confirmed. Although my main source of income has always been salary and royalties, I did exploit others and was raised in an exploiting class environment, which planted the roots of my feudal consciousness.

    The most significant influence comes from this exploiting class's feudal education. I didn't go to school until I was fifteen years old; before that, I studied old books with my father. My father was very strict in his discipline, and from a young age, I developed a timid and reserved personality, lacking any adventurous spirit. Later, my selfishness, compromise, and vacillation were all related to this feudal family education. The most profound influence I received from the old books was the Taoist idea of purity, emptiness, and non-action. According to my incorrect understanding, this idea believes that all rights and wrongs, good and evil in the world, can be equally regarded from a higher perspective, not worth deep consideration. In order not to cause trouble for ourselves, we should "yield to fate" (let nature take its course), remain pure and inactive, and achieve a clean state. This is an extremely selfish and arrogant idea of the exploiting class. This idea fostered my contempt for the masses, a detached attitude towards myself, and a compromising and conservative attitude towards dealing with people and the world. Stand on the sidelines and watch the fire; don't get involved. If disaster befalls oneself, it is best to avoid it. A friend criticized me, saying that I deal with people like practicing Tai Chi. This is a very insightful remark. The secret of Tai Chi lies in using softness to overcome hardness, not attacking but only defending, adapting to circumstances, and being good at yielding. This is actually the Taoist art of dealing with the world, which is also what people generally call "worldliness." To be worldly, one must always move in the direction of the least resistance, not resisting but only compromising. Compromise is the only way to "defend" and avoid trouble that is unfavorable to oneself. Clearly, this is selfishness, but we intellectuals from the exploiting class like to give it a beautiful disguise, calling it "transcendence" or "loftiness," to feed our feelings of arrogance.

    This set of feudal consciousness is my native root, and I later used the imperialist Western education to "graft" onto it. After I turned twenty-two, I entered the University of Hong Kong and received colonial education. Then I transferred to England and France, where I lingered in several universities for eight or nine years. During this period, I was fascinated by two things: idealistic aesthetics and romantic literature. The essence of idealistic aesthetics lies in "contemplation for its own sake," in transcending politics, morality, and all practical life, and simply appreciating the affairs of life and artistic works as a picture. The characteristic of romantic literature is to promote individual freedom, to trust emotions and imagination to vent and build castles in the air. This kind of aesthetics and literature are in cahoots with each other, both reflecting the morbidity of capitalist society. Intellectuals are helpless in the face of social corruption, so they escape reality, give up active struggle, and temporarily seek personal spiritual enjoyment, even becoming accomplices of evil and maintaining the rule of the reactionary regime. At the time, I was of course blind to this, only feeling that they were perfect. Clearly, idealistic aesthetics and romantic literature have common points with Chinese Taoist thought, so they naturally merged in my mind. The result of this "grafting" turned me into a monster who not only thought he was beyond politics but also thought he was beyond society. I imagined a high and mighty class, standing on it to savor castles in the air, even treating the real world as a castle in the air, and watching everything with a cold eye, feeling that all kinds of people and things were equally interesting. This can be called "theatricalism," which is actually "cynical hedonism." After listening to Premier Zhou's report this time, I felt that the most relevant criticism to me was the passage criticizing the bystander attitude.

    If one has a disease, the harm is limited to oneself, but if it spreads to others, the situation becomes more serious. In the past two or thirty years, I have constantly used my set of toxic ideas to write books and articles, among which "Twelve Letters to Young People" and "Literary Psychology" have gained a wide readership and won the praise of many young people. This was beyond my initial expectations. At that time, I was still a young man, and my original intention was nothing more than to earn some royalties and gain some fame. It is evident, from how the debut work of an unknown nobody like me actually caused a sensation for a time, the poverty and chaos of the Chinese ideological world at the time. My thought is a kind of escapist thought, the root of which lies in the combination of feudal thought and comprador thought formed by Western education, as mentioned above. It reflects both nostalgia for feudal society and aversion to reality in the late stage of Western capitalism. At that time, Chinese society was in a state of extreme chaos, and the general youth were suffering, feeling that there was no way out. I pointed out an escape route to them. The reason why my books were widely welcomed was precisely because they catered to the lazy weakness in people's psychology. The possible impact of them is of course to make readers give up active struggle, and this in effect helps to maintain reactionary rule. Last year, Cai Yi and others criticized my aesthetic thought in "Literary Gazette," and at that time I was still a little unconvinced. In the past year, I have studied the new literary theory a little, and only then did I realize that my basic position and views are all wrong. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to my readers and critics.

    In the past, I prided myself on being "lofty" and "transcendent." Now I ask myself these questions: Have I really been "observing" in the past twenty years? Have I really been "transcendent"? I have been teaching in universities without interruption. Who am I serving after all? In the past, I invariably thought that this was for education and for scholarship. Now, after careful review, I realize that what I have been diligently working on first and foremost is for my own personal interests, for fame and wealth, for status. In reality, it is not as lofty and transcendent as I thought. I served under the reactionary government and was, in reality, still a cog in that reactionary machine. I always harbored the illusion of "scholarship for the sake of scholarship," standing on the position of "academic freedom," and at one time opposed the Kuomintang in speech and action. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, as the Dean of Academic Affairs of Wuhan University, I finally joined the Kuomintang, and in the capacity of a senior staff member, I was transferred to the Kuomintang "Central Training Corps" for training. Following this, I wrote some reactionary articles for reactionary publications such as "Central Weekly," "Weekly Commentary," and "Independent Current Affairs Society." I held the nominal title of a pseudo-central committee member, and I even attended Chiang Kai-shek's banquet in Beijing. Although all of this can be justified with some excuses, it is an undeniable fact that I stood on the position of the reactionaries and served the reactionaries.

    One thing that needs to be specifically reviewed here is my attitude towards the student movement. I have always been unsympathetic to the student movement. I remember that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Hu Shih gave a speech in the Third Courtyard of Peking University, advising students not to strike. Many students booed him on the spot; I felt very uncomfortable, thinking it was simply nonsense. During my time at Wuhan University, I don't remember having any direct conflicts with the student movement, but I remained unsympathetic. At that time, my lack of sympathy mainly stemmed from a trans-political point of view, thinking that students should just focus on studying. After Peking University was restored, the student movement became more intense, and my attitude towards the student movement became more reactionary. I published articles in newspapers discrediting the student movement, and I also opposed the proposal to support the strike in the faculty meeting. At this time, the old concept that students should just focus on studying still existed, but mainly because I had already stood on the reactionary position and did not clearly understand the revolutionary nature of the student movement, fearing that the school would be shaken as a result. At that time, I and the school administrative staff stood on the same side, all afraid of trouble, offending the reactionary government. In the final analysis, I was still thinking of maintaining that reactionary government. I thought I was right at the time, but now I understand the revolutionary significance of the student movement, and when I think of those reactionary remarks, I feel ashamed. This is something I should apologize to the people for.

    Now I analyze the root cause of my mistakes in the set of false trans-political concepts of "scholarship for the sake of scholarship" that I learned from Western education. In fact, advocating trans-politics is to maintain—or at least tolerate—reactionary rule, and if it is promoted, it is also counter-revolutionary. In the past, I also harbored illusions such as the "middle road." Now I see clearly: After the May Fourth Movement, Chinese intellectuals fundamentally only had two paths to take, either revolution or counter-revolution. To tout the "middle road" and advocate "trans-politics" in the fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution will sooner or later lead to being drawn into the trap of the reactionary regime and "going along with it." This is my painful experience, and it is also the painful experience of many intellectuals like me.

    By the way, I want to review my comprador thought. I have received a long period of education in British and French imperialism, and I like French people and French culture very much; I value English literature very much; I can't say that I love British people, but I admire them somewhat. As for Americans and American culture, I have always looked down on them. But these are just small differences. In general, I admire European culture, from Greece to the present, very much. I have never thought that Chinese culture is inferior to others in every way, but I have definitely thought that Western culture is stronger than us in some aspects. One of my ambitions is to transport some of it to China. In terms of political thought, I was once fascinated by British and American "democracy and freedom," and I also hoped that it could be applied to China. Although I look down on Americans, the idea that Americans are rich and powerful has deep roots. I don't have the disease of being pro-American, but I have had the disease of being afraid of America. When the volunteer army first arrived in Korea, I was very frightened at the time, fearing that this would cause a major disaster. After more than a year of anti-American aggression and aid-Korea education, I gradually had a clearer understanding. Several things can be used as examples. In the past, I repeatedly wanted to find an opportunity to go abroad again. Now I hope that several good friends who have been in Britain, France, and the United States for a long time can return to China as soon as possible. In the past, I was invited by the British Cultural Committee to give a speech, and I felt honored at the time, but now I feel ashamed. In the past, when I heard others worry about the military force of the United States, I expressed some sympathy, but now when I hear the same argument, I feel that he is backward and want to argue with him until we are red in the face. However, long-term roots are not easy to eradicate at once. Therefore, I have a deeper understanding of the importance of learning. It constantly raises vigilance and constantly unearths the toxic thoughts in the subconscious (a deep pit of dirt and filth) so that they can be cleaned.

    Finally, I have to examine my current position. I ask myself this question: Have I abandoned the reactionary position and stood on the people's position? The answer given by the surface consciousness is affirmative. As a professor, I am teaching earnestly; as the leader of the trade union study group, I am studying earnestly and doing things earnestly. I think this is serving the interests of the people. But after thinking deeper, I am still a little apprehensive. As a timid and reserved person, I have never dared to be sloppy about the work I should do. It was so in the past, and it is still the same now. The problem is whether my meticulous work is still for my own food, clothing, status, and reputation? Standing on the people's position, is the degree of my meticulous work enough? I must frankly admit that I cannot withstand the test of these two questions now. For example, when teaching, I inevitably only work hard in the classroom, and the work of helping students outside the classroom is not enough; as a group leader, I inevitably hold the attitude of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault," shrinking back and only being afraid of making mistakes. This shows that I am planning more for myself and less for the people. This also shows that my political level is still very low, and there are still serious problems such as a purely technical point of view, bureaucratism, and a hired point of view. The result of learning so far has only made me intellectually understand what is meant by the people's position, and also understand that I have not yet truly stood on the people's position. I believe that consciousness can also affect existence. My understanding, although a preliminary gain, is also an important gain, because it can be the basis for my efforts to move forward.

    最近学习中几点检讨
    北京大学西方语文系教授  朱光潜
    在最近两个月教师学习中，我重新检讨了我的思想，发现百孔千疮，病根都在封建意识和洋教育。
    伏根最深的是封建意识。从前常把自己划分到小资产阶级，这是不忠实的为自己开脱。在两代以上，我的家庭本属于地主阶级，到祖父手里才没落到小资产阶级。祖父和父亲都靠教书维持生活。但是到了父亲晚年，家里有些积蓄，又买了一些田，做了地主。在抗战期中，我的妻子又拿了一些积蓄，在她的四川娘家附近买了些田。所以我的地主身份是确定了的。虽然我的主要生活来源一向是薪资收入和稿费版税，我确是剥削过旁人的，而且是在剥削阶级环境中培养起来的，这就栽下我的封建意识的根。
    影响最大的是这剥削阶级的封建教育。我到十五岁才进学校，前此都跟父亲读旧书。父亲管教极严，我从小就养成一种怯懦拘谨的性格，没有一点冒险的精神，后来自私自利，妥协动摇，都与这封建的家教有关。我从旧书中受到影响最深的是道家清虚无为的那一套思想。这思想依我的不正确的了解，是认为人世一切是非善恶，在超一层的地位去看，都可等量齐观，值不得深加计较，为着不自寻烦恼，我们最好“任运随化”（听其自然），清虚无为，落得一个干净。这是剥削阶级的一个极自私自利和自高自大的思想。这种思想养成了我轻视群众，自处超然的态度，也养成了我对人处世的妥协保守的态度。隔岸观火，事不关己，且莫过问。倘若祸事临到自己头上，也以闪避为妙。有位朋友批评我，说我应付人事就像打太极拳。这话真是一语破的。打太极拳的秘诀在以柔制刚，不攻只守，随方就圆，善于让避。这其实就是道家的处世术，也就是一般人所谓“世故”。要讲世故，就要处处朝抵抗力最小的方向走，不抵抗，只妥协，妥协才能“守”，才能避免于己不利的麻烦。明明这是自私自利，我们剥削阶级出身的知识分子却欢喜给它一个漂亮的化装，说这是“超脱”，这是“清高”，来喂养自高自大的感觉。
    这套封建意识是我的土生土长的根干，我后来又拿帝国主义的洋教育来“移花接木”。到了二十二岁之后，我就进了香港大学，受了殖民地的教育，随后又转到英国和法国，在几个大学里一直混了八九年。在这时期中，我所醉心的是两种东西，一是唯心主义的美学，一是浪漫主义的文学。唯心派美学的要义在“无所为而为的观照”，在超脱政治，道德以及一切实际生活，只把人生世相和文艺作品当作一幅图画去欣赏。浪漫派文学的特点在发挥个人自由，信任情感想像去发泄，去造空中楼阁。这种美学和文学是沆瀣一气的，都是反映资本主义社会的病态，知识分子对着社会的恶浊束手无策，于是逃避现实，放弃积极斗争，姑图个人的精神享乐，甚至为虎作伥，维护反动政权的统治。当时我对此当然是盲目的，只觉它们尽善尽美。很显然的，唯心派美学和浪漫派文学都和中国道家思想有共同点，所以它们在我思想里就自然一碰就接合起来了。这种“移花接木”的结果就把我养成一个不但自以为超政治而且自以为超社会的怪物，我臆造一个高高在上的阶层，站在那上面去玩味空中楼阁，连现实世界也当作空中楼阁看，对一切都冷眼旁观，觉得种种人件件事都一样顶有趣。这可以叫做“看戏主义”，其实就是“滑稽玩世”。这次听周总理的报告，觉得最切中我的要害的是批判旁观态度的那一段话。
    自己有病，所害还仅限于一身，传染到旁人，情形可就更严重。过去二三十年中我不断的用我的那套有毒思想来编书写文章，其中像“给青年的十二封信”和“文艺心理学”之类竟得到很广大的读者群，并且博得许多青年的赞赏。这是我初料所不及的。我当时还是一个年青人，本意无非借此赚点稿费，取得一点声名。像我这样一个无名小卒的处女作居然轰动了一时，可见当时中国思想界的贫乏与混乱。我的思想是一种逃避主义的思想，其根源在上文所说的封建思想与洋教育所形成的买办思想的结合，它一方面反映着对封建社会的留恋，一方面也反映着西方资本主义末期的厌畏现实。当时中国社会正处在极紊乱的状态，一般青年苦闷，觉得无路可走，我向他们指点出一条逃避的路，我的那些书之所以广受欢迎，也正因为投合一般人心理上懒怠的弱点。它们可能发生的影响当然是使读者们放弃积极斗争，而这在无形中也就帮助维持了反动统治。去年蔡仪诸人在“文艺报”对我的美学思想进行了批判，当时我心里还有些不服。这一年来我对新的文艺理论稍加研究，才明白我的基本立场和观点都是错误的。我愿意趁此向我的读者和批评者谢罪。
    从前我自负“清高”“超脱”，现在我向自己提出这样一些问题：过去二十年我是否真正在“旁观”呢？是否真正“超脱”呢？我没有间断的在大学里教书，究竟是为谁服务呢？从前我未尝不自以为这是为教育，为学术，现在细加检讨，才明白我孳孳不倦的首先是为我自己个人的利益，为名利，为地位，实际上并非如自己所想的那样清高超脱。我在反动政府之下服务，实际上还是推动那座反动机器的一颗螺丝钉。我一向存着“为学术而学术”的幻想，站在“学术自由”的地位，在言论上和行动上都一度反对过国民党。可是在抗战中武汉大学教务长任内，终于加入了国民党，又以高级职员的身份调到国民党“中央训练团”受过训，接着替“中央周刊”，“周论”，“独立时论社”之类反动刊物写了些反动的文章，任过伪中央委员的名义，在北京还赴过蒋介石的宴会。尽管这一切都可以找到一些为自己开脱的借口，我站上了反动派的立场，替反动派服务，却是无可讳言的事实。
    有一件事须特别在此提出检讨的，就是我对于学生运动的态度。对学生运动我一向是不同情的。记得抗战前有一次胡适在北京大学三院演讲，劝学生不要罢课，当场就有许多学生在下面嘘；我心里很不舒服，以为简直是胡闹。在武汉大学时期，我记不得与学生运动起过直接的冲突，不同情是依旧的。那时的不同情还主要的是从超政治的观点出发，以为学生只要专心读书。到了北京大学复原以后，学生运动愈剧烈，我对学生运动的态度也就愈趋反动。我在报纸上发表过诋毁学生运动的文章，在教授会里也反对过拥护罢课的提议。这时候学生只要专心读书那个老观念也还存在，但主要的是由于我已站上反动的立场，对学生运动的革命性质认识不清，怕学校因此受动摇。当时我和学校行政人员都站在一边，都深怕出乱子，得罪了反动政府，归根结蒂，还是在想维持那个反动政府。当时我还自以为是，现在我明白学生运动的革命意义了，想起那些反动的言论，真觉无地自容。这是我应该向人民谢罪的。
    现在我分析我的错误根源在从洋教育那里得来的那一套“为学术而学术”的虚伪的超政治的观念。事实上主张超政治便是维护——至少是容忍——反动的统治，如果加以鼓吹，也便是反革命。从前我也存过“中间路线”之类的幻想。现在我看明白了：从五四运动之后，中国知识分子根本上只有两条路可走，不是革命，便是反革命。在革命和反革命的猛烈斗争中标榜“中间路线”，鼓吹“超政治”，迟早总要卷进反动政权的圈套里去，和它“同流合污”。这便是我的惨痛的经验，也是许多类似我的知识分子的惨痛的经验。
    趁便我要检讨一下我的买办思想。我受过长期的英法帝国主义的教育，对于法国人和法国文化都很爱好；很看重英国文学；对英国人说不上亲爱，却有些佩服。至于美国人和美国文化我都一向不大瞧得起。不过这只是一些小差别。概括的说，我对欧洲文化，从希腊以至现在，都非常景仰。我倒不曾想过中国文化处处不如人，不过确曾想过西方文化在某些方面是比我们强。我的一个野心就是要把它搬运一些到中国来。在政治思想方面，我曾经醉心于英美式“民主自由”，也曾经想望过它可以应用到中国。我虽瞧不起美国人，可是美国人富强一个观念是有长久根源的。亲美病我没有，恐美病我却有过。志愿军初到朝鲜，当时我很心惊胆怯，深怕这要惹起大祸事。经过一年多的抗美援朝的教育，我才逐渐有较清楚的认识。有几件事可以为例。从前我一再想找机会再去外国，现在我渴望久在英法美的几位好朋友能赶快回国。从前我应英国文化委员会邀约，作过演讲，当时自觉荣幸，现在深以为耻。从前听旁人忧虑到美国的武力，多少表示同感，现在听到同样论调，心里就嫌他落后，要和他争到面红耳赤。不过长久根源不易一旦就拔除干净。因此我就更深的体会到学习的重要。它不断的提高警惕，不断的把下意识（一个藏垢纳污的深坑）中的有毒思想发掘出来，因而加以洗清。
    最后，我得检查一下现在的立场。我向自己提出这样一个问题：我是否已经丢开反动立场而站上人民立场呢？由浮面意识所给的答案是肯定的。我当教授，在认真地教书；我当工会学习小组长，在认真地学习，认真地办事。我认为这便是为人民利益而服务。不过向深一层思索一下，我还是有些惶惑。我这怯懦拘谨的人对自己应做的一份事向来就不敢马虎，从前如此，现在也还不过是如此。问题在我的做事不马虎是否还是为着自己的衣食地位和名誉？是否站在人民立场来说，我的不马虎的程度就算够了？我得坦白地承认，我现在还经不起这两个问题的考验。比如说，教书我还是不免只在课堂上认真，课外帮助同学的工作还不够；做小组长我还不免持“不求有功，但求无过”的态度，缩手缩脚，只是为着怕犯错误。这就说明了我为自己打算的多，为人民打算的少。这也就说明了我的政治水平还很低，还存在着纯技术观点，事务主义以及雇佣观点之类严重的毛病。学习的结果到现在为止，只做到使我在理智上明白什么叫做人民立场，而且明白我还没有真正站上了人民立场。我相信意识也可以影响存在，我的这一点认识虽是一个初步的收获，却也是一个重要的收获，因为它可以做我向前努力的基础。
