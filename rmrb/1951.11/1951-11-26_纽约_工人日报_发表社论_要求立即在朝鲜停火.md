Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 25th: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 19th commenting on the recent US ceasefire proposal in Korea. Under the title "Stop Shooting! Why Wait Until Christmas?" the editorial wrote: "As far as the security of the United States is concerned, there is no reason whatsoever not to tell our boys to stop dying in Korea immediately, no reason not to have a ceasefire immediately, and no reason not to have our troops withdraw before Christmas."

The "Daily Worker" exposed the US side's preparation to use issues such as the exchange of prisoners of war to create new obstacles to the negotiations, saying: Since there is this Colonel (referring to Colonel Hanley) with the same mind as MacArthur, deliberately concocting a clumsy propaganda about the so-called atrocities of killing prisoners of war during the Korean armistice negotiations, then they may use the issue of exchanging prisoners of war as a new excuse to undermine the ceasefire negotiations. The editorial concluded: "We believe this is an atrocity that endangers our country. Let us urge the White House to order a ceasefire immediately."

    纽约“工人日报”发表社论
    要求立即在朝鲜停火
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】纽约“工人日报”十九日社论评论美国最近的朝鲜停战建议，社论在“停止射击！何必等到圣诞节？”的标题下写着：“以美国的安全而论，没有丝毫理由不叫我们的孩子们立刻停止在朝鲜死亡，没有丝毫理由不该马上停火，不该让我们的军队在圣诞节以前撤退。”
    “工人日报”揭露美方准备以交换俘虏之类的问题对谈判作新的阻挠说：既然有这末一位有着跟麦克阿瑟一样的头脑的上校（按指汉莱上校），故意在朝鲜休战谈判期间弄出一套拙劣的所谓杀俘暴行的虚假宣传，那末他们就可能利用交换俘虏的问题作为一种新的借口，以便破坏休战谈判。社论在结语中说：“我们认为这才是危害我国的一种暴行。让我们催促白宫立刻下令停火。”
