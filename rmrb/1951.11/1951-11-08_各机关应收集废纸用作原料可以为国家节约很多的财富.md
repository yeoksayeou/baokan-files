    All Organizations Should Collect Waste Paper as Raw Material to Save the Country a Lot of Wealth
    Editor: The "Waste Paper Recycling" suggestion from reader Li Wen, published in the Northeast Daily on September 12th, has received a response from many readers. According to Li Wen, it has been estimated that all organizations in Northeast China burn 5,000 tons of waste paper annually. If this waste paper is used as raw material, it can produce pulp for 200,000 reams of office paper, with a value equivalent to more than twenty fighter planes. What an astonishing figure!
    Although China's paper industry is currently actively increasing production, it still cannot meet the cultural needs of the liberated masses. Therefore, to avoid burning waste paper that can be used as raw material without any benefit, I suggest that, except for classified government documents and drafts that the responsible personnel deem necessary to retain, all other general waste paper should be collected daily by each department, stored in sacks in a dedicated room, and then handed over to paper mills or pulp manufacturers, who will be responsible for the waste paper processing work. In this way, it does not conflict with the state's confidentiality policy and can also solve the current difficulties faced by paper mills due to a shortage of raw materials.

### 各机关应收集废纸用作原料可以为国家节约很多的财富

    各机关应收集废纸用作原料可以为国家节约很多的财富
    编辑同志：东北日报九月十二日发表了读者李文的
    “废纸回收”的建议，已得到了很多读者的响应。根据李文所说，有人估计过，全东北机关每年烧毁的废纸有五千吨。如果把这些废纸来做原料，可以制造二十万令办公纸的原料用浆，价值相当于二十多架战斗机。这是多么惊人的数字啊！
    我国造纸业目前虽然正在积极增产，但还不能适应解放了的广大人民对文化要求的需要。因此，为了避免把可以作为原料的废纸毫无代价地烧毁，我建议：除了有关政府机密的和经办人员认为必要留存的文件的底稿以外，其他绝大部分的一般的废纸，各部门应每天收集起来，用麻袋存储妥放一室，然后交给纸厂或纸浆制造厂，负责办理废纸加工工作。这样，既不抵触国家保密的政策，还可以解决今天纸厂缺乏原料的困难。
