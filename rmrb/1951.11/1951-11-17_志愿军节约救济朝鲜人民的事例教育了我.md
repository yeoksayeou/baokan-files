    The Deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Saving and Relieving the Korean People Educated Me

    Comrade Editor: After seeing the photograph published on page four of the People's Daily on October 25th, depicting a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers launching a movement to save an ounce or two of rice to relieve the Korean people, I deeply felt the noble qualities and great internationalist spirit of the Volunteer comrades in serving the people. The Volunteer comrades are working so hard at the front, not only without enjoying better comforts, but also saving on their own food to relieve the Korean people. But me, I was making a fuss about my compensation, complaining that the contract system was too low, and demanding a salary system or a job transfer. Comparing these individualistic ideas of enjoyment with the Volunteer comrades, I truly feel ashamed. Therefore, I am determined to learn from the Volunteer comrades and overcome individualistic ideas of enjoyment.

　　志愿军节约救济朝鲜人民的事例教育了我
    编辑同志：看到十月二十五日人民日报第四版刊登的中国人民志愿军某部展开节约一两米运动，救济朝鲜人民的照片后，使我深深地感觉到志愿军同志为人民服务的崇高品质和伟大的国际主义精神。志愿军同志在前线作战是那样的辛苦，不但没有较好的享受，而且还节约自己的伙食来救济朝鲜人民。而我呢，却闹待遇，嫌包干制低，要求薪金制或调动工作。这些个人主义的享乐思想，和志愿军同志相比一下，真使我感到惭愧。所以我要决心向志愿军同志学习，克服个人主义的享乐思想。
