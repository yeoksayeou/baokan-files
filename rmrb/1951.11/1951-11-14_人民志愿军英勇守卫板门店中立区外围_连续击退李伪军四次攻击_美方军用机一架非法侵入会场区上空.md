Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong Front, 13th: The People's Volunteer Army, defending the Panmunjom neutral zone, repelled four attacks by the Li Syngman puppet army on the perimeter of the Panmunjom neutral zone in the four days from the 8th to the 11th. These four attacks occurred only four to nine kilometers from the conference site in Panmunjom. The enemy troops participating in the attack were identified as the 11th and 12th Regiments of the Li Syngman puppet army's 1st Division and the division's direct reconnaissance unit. The attacking force numbered at least 70, and at most reached a battalion. Each enemy attack suffered varying degrees of losses. At about 4 a.m. on the 8th, a company of the 11th Regiment of the puppet 1st Division attacked Arrow Gate Village southeast of Panmunjom, and 21 were killed or wounded. On the night of the 9th, more than 70 soldiers from the direct reconnaissance unit of the puppet 1st Division raided and occupied our Cangnei-ri position eight kilometers south of Panmunjom. Our army immediately counterattacked, capturing three enemy soldiers, and the enemy left more than ten corpses and fled. On the same night, a battalion of the 12th Regiment of the puppet 1st Division attacked our position east of Daedeok Mountain, nine kilometers northeast of Panmunjom. Twenty-seven warriors of our army guarding the position fought fiercely with the enemy for five hours, repelling five enemy attacks in succession, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 100 enemy soldiers. At about 5 a.m. on the 11th, more than one company of the 11th Regiment of the puppet 1st Division attacked our position in Durosalli, four kilometers south of Panmunjom, and retreated after being heavily damaged by our powerful artillery fire.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th: This reporter reports: At about 8 a.m. on November 10th, the weather was clear, and a U.S. Mustang fighter plane, in violation of the agreement prohibiting military aircraft from flying over the Panmunjom conference area, intruded into the airspace of the conference area from near the marker balloon in the western airspace of the Panmunjom conference area and flew east. Our liaison officer, Colonel Chai Chengwen, notified the U.S. liaison officer, Colonel Murray, of the above situation at 1:05 p.m. on the 10th, requesting the U.S. side to pay attention and provide an explanation. At about 11 a.m. on the 11th, Colonel Murray informed our liaison officer that after investigation, it was confirmed that a U.S. military aircraft had indeed illegally flown over the Panmunjom conference area at about 8 a.m. on the 10th. After a detailed investigation is completed, a report will be made to our side, and the pilot will be punished.
