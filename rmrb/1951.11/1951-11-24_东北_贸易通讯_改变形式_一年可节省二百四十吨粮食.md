    Northeast "Trade Newsletter" Changes Format
    Saving 240 Tons of Grain Per Year
    Editor: The "Trade Newsletter" published by the Northeast Trade Department, when it was changed from a single sheet to a magazine format in March of this year, greatly increased the cost of the publication due to formalism within the editorial department of the journal, which believed that a colored cover was necessary for it to look like a proper publication. Preliminary calculations show that from the March redesign to the end of October, a period of eight months, the colored cover alone wasted 71.31 million yuan. If each ton of grain is calculated at 750,000 yuan, this is equivalent to 95 tons of grain. Furthermore, due to bureaucratic work style, three issues were discarded (wasting approximately 18.7 million yuan, equivalent to 25 tons of grain), resulting in a total waste equivalent to 120 tons of grain. This amount could feed 600 people for a year (at 400 jin per person per year).

    After recognizing the seriousness of this waste, the editorial department of the journal decided to immediately cancel the 80-pound coated paper colored cover, change the publication format, and enrich the content of the publication. They also made a plan to save 240 tons of grain in 1952. The specific methods are: 1. Change the annual publication frequency from 36 issues to 50 issues, and reduce each issue from 32 pages to 16 pages, eliminating the cover. Based on this calculation, 196 tons of grain can be saved annually. 2. Improve the quality of the publication, strive for concise articles, save 20% of the words, and change the 2-fen spacing between lines to 4-fen spacing to include more words. In this way, the text can be increased by 37%. If calculated based on an annual publication of 300,000 copies, paper costs equivalent to 37 tons of grain can be saved. 3. Clerical work will be done by the editors, reducing the use of mastheads and saving stationery paper, saving a total of 7 tons of grain. According to the above figures, 240 tons of grain can be saved for the country in 1952. Jin Xin

### 东北“贸易通讯”改变形式  一年可节省二百四十吨粮食

    东北“贸易通讯”改变形式
    一年可节省二百四十吨粮食
    编辑同志：东北贸易部出版的“贸易通讯”，在今年三月由单页改成杂志本时，由于该刊编辑科存在着形式主义，认为有个套色的封皮才像个刊物的样子，因而大大增加了期刊的成本费用。经初步计算，该科从三月改版到十月末八个月间，仅套色封皮一项，即浪费七千一百三十一万元。如每吨粮食按七十五万元折合，就相当于九十五吨粮食；再加上由于工作作风上的官僚主义而造成的三期废品（约浪费一千八百七十万元，合粮食二十五吨），共浪费值一百二十吨粮食。这个数字可以供给六百人一年的食用（每人每年以四百斤计）。
    该刊编辑科认识这一浪费现象的严重性以后，决定立即取消八十磅模造纸的套色封皮，改变出版形式，充实刊物内容。并做出一九五二年节约二百四十吨粮食的计划。具体的办法是：一、将全年出版期数三十六期改为五十期，每期由三十二版改为十六版，取消封皮。依此计算，全年可节约粮食一百九十六吨；二、提高刊物质量，力求文章精练，节约字数百分之二十，并将行与行间的二分条改为四分条，以多登字数。这样，共可增加文字百分之三十七。如按全年出版三十万份计算，即可节省纸张费合粮食三十七吨；三、文书工作由编辑代做，少用刊头和节省文具纸张等，共可节约七吨粮食。按以上数字统计，一九五二年将可为国家节约粮食二百四十吨。　晋　新
