　　Responding to Chairman Mao's call will lead to a better life
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Minxin
    This year's bumper harvest on both sides of the Huai River has made the local farmers clearly understand a truth: responding to Chairman Mao's call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well" will lead to a better life. Now, the second annual Huai River harnessing project, which is even larger in scale, is about to start, and thousands of migrant workers are once again carrying shovels and mud baskets, heading for the Huai River harnessing construction site.
    Dongping Township, Fuyang County, Anhui North District, held a farmers' representative meeting last month to discuss the harnessing of the Huai River. At the meeting, Zhang Minglun, a 77-year-old farmer, said: "We had a bumper harvest this year, but we must not forget the pain after the wound heals! The Huai River still has problems! If we relax, the Huai River will relapse and our good life will not last!" Another old farmer, Zhang Zongyao, said:
    "When the Huai River is harnessed well, it will protect the crops, and it will also open up waterways and generate electricity. Good days are ahead!" As a result of the discussion, many farmers enthusiastically signed up to participate in the harnessing of the Huai River.
    The land reform movement that the farmers of Dongping Township had been looking forward to for a long time was also about to begin at this time. The farmers had suffered all the hardships of exploitation and oppression by landlords in the past, and they all wanted to participate in this movement personally. But what to do since they also had to harness the Huai River? Before the representative meeting, everyone had no way, and they all thought that they should go to harness the Huai River after the land reform. At this time, the cadres, Communist Party members, and Youth League members of Dongping Township went to various mutual aid groups and to each family to think of solutions together with everyone. A solution was finally found, which was to divide the township into two teams, one to repair the Huai River and the other to carry out land reform at home. In this way, they convened a representative meeting to discuss it.
    The representative meeting decided: The township will send one-third of its cadres and all its labor force to harness the Huai River. After this discussion, the registration to participate in the Huai River harnessing was very enthusiastic. The labor models and experienced migrant workers and cadres in the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project all automatically signed up to participate. They said: "We will go to harness the Huai River and will not return until we complete the task!" The farmers who stayed at home also made a guarantee: "We will definitely fight the battle of land reform well, and we will also take the time to send food and tools to support you."
    For the sake of harnessing the Huai River and land reform, the autumn plowing and wheat planting in Dongping Township this time was very tense. The farmers were busy planting wheat during the day, and at night they squeezed under the lights to weave bamboo baskets for carrying mud; the militiamen who were going to participate in the Huai River harnessing were busy wiping their guns. The women of the township were also very busy, they were working day and night to grind flour for the migrant workers who were harnessing the Huai River and helping to raise tools for digging the river.
    On the morning of October 25th, 260 migrant workers from Dongping Township, carrying shovels, mud baskets, mats for building work sheds, bamboo, pots for cooking, etc., rushed to the banks of the Huai River to receive an inspection. During the inspection, under the red flag waving in the wind, the migrant workers participating in the Huai River harnessing unanimously swore: In the second annual Huai River harnessing project, we will work hard to strive for a better life!

　　响应毛主席的号召，就能过更美好的日子
    新华社记者  朱敏信
    今年淮河两岸丰收，使当地农民清楚地懂得了一个真理，响应毛主席的“一定要把淮河修好”的号召，就能过更美好的日子。现在，规模更大的第二年度治淮工程快动工了，千百万民工又扛起铁锹、泥筐，向治淮工地开拔。
    皖北区阜阳县东屏乡，上月开了一次农民代表大会，讨论治淮。会上，七十七岁的老农张明伦说：“今年丰收了，俺们不要好了疮疤忘掉痛啊！淮河的毛病还有呀！俺们一松劲，淮河发起老毛病来，俺们的好日子就过不成！”另一位老农张宗耀说：
    “淮河治好了，保住了庄稼，还要开航路和发电。好日子在后头哩！”讨论的结果，好些农民热情蓬勃地报名要求参加治淮。
    东屏乡农民盼了好久的土地改革运动这时也快展开了。农民们过去受尽地主剥削、压迫的苦头，都想亲身参加这个运动。但是又要治淮，怎么办呢？开代表会以前，大家没有办法，都想土地改革后再去治淮吧。这时，东屏乡的干部、共产党员和青年团员们，就分头到各个互助组去，到每个家庭去，和大家一起想办法。办法终于想出来了，就是把全乡分成两支队伍，一支去修淮河，一支在家里办土地改革。这样，他们便召开代表会来讨论。
    代表会讨论决定了：全乡抽出三分之一的干部和全劳动力去治淮。经过这次讨论后，报名参加治淮的很踊跃，第一期治淮工程中的劳动模范和有经验的民工、干部，全都自动报名参加了。他们说：“俺们去治淮，不完成任务不回来！”留在家里的农民也提出保证说：“俺们一定打好土地改革这一仗，还抽时间送粮食、送工具支援你们。”
    为了治淮河和土地改革，东屏乡这次秋耕种麦很紧张。农民们白天忙着种麦，夜间又挤在灯下编挑泥的竹筐；要参加治淮的民兵就忙着擦枪。全乡妇女们也很忙，她们在日夜不停地忙着给治淮的民工磨面和帮助筹集挖河的工具。
    十月二十五日的早上，东屏乡二百六十个民工，带着挖河的铁锹、泥筐、搭工棚的席子、竹子，烧饭的锅子等，齐奔在淮河的岸上接受了一次检阅。检阅的时候，在迎风招展的红旗下，参加治淮的民工一致宣誓说：我们在第二年度的治淮工程中一定努力干活，争取过更美好的日子！
