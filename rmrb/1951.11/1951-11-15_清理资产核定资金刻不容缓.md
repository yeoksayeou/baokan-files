A brief commentary on economic life

　　Cleaning up Assets and Verifying Funds is Imperative
    The work of cleaning up assets and verifying funds currently being carried out in factories and mines across the country is the first step in implementing economic accounting and an effective way to eliminate waste. However, some enterprise cadres still do not understand the importance of this work. Therefore, they still hold a negative and perfunctory attitude towards this work. When the Zhengzhou Railway Administration was cleaning up its assets, a few cadres said: "We are still far from implementing economic accounting here, so cleaning up assets can be postponed." This kind of thinking once hindered the work of cleaning up assets and verifying funds in the bureau to varying degrees. Letting the work of cleaning up assets and verifying funds be "postponed" means allowing the state's human, material, and financial resources to continue to suffer incalculable losses. Can this be allowed? Some enterprise cadres do not pay attention to this work because they do not yet understand that increasing production and practicing strict economy to increase the power to resist America and aid Korea is the central task of the Chinese people at present; they do not even understand how serious the losses that have been caused to the country by working "without a clear idea" as in the past.
    Of course, some of China's state-owned enterprises cannot immediately implement economic accounting. However, in order to strive for the early implementation of economic accounting, it is now necessary to make the necessary preparations, that is, to do a good job in cleaning up assets and verifying funds. Fighting against the phenomenon of wasting state assets is our slogan.

### 清理资产核定资金刻不容缓

　　清理资产核定资金刻不容缓
    目前各地工厂、矿山所进行的清理资产核定资金工作，是实行经济核算制的第一步，是消灭浪费的有效办法。但是，有些企业干部，直到现在还不了解这一工作的重要意义。因此，他们对这一工作还抱着消极敷衍的态度。郑州铁路管理局清理资产时，少数干部就说：“我们这里离实行经济核算还远，清理资产，可缓一缓再说。”这种思想曾经或多或少地妨碍了该局的清理资产核定资金工作。让清理资产核定资金工作“缓一缓”，这就是说，让国家的人力、物力、财力继续遭受不可计算的损失。这难道是可以允许的吗？有些企业干部之所以不重视这一工作，是因为他们还不了解增加生产，厉行节约，以增加抗美援朝的力量，乃是我国人民当前的中心任务；他们甚至不了解，像过去那样“心中无数”地作工作，已经给国家造成了多么严重的损失。
    当然，目前我国若干国营企业，还不能立即实行经济核算制。但是，为了争取早日实行经济核算制，现在必须进行必要的准备，这就是必须把清理资产核定资金工作搞好。和浪费国家资财的现象作斗争，这就是我们的口号。
