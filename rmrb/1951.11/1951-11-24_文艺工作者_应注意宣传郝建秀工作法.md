    Literary and Art Workers
    Should Pay Attention to Publicizing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    Editor: The Hao Jianxiu Work Method has gradually been promoted nationwide. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method should not only be studied by textile workers, but also by workers in other factories. This is a major innovation in China's industry, so I think it is very necessary to vigorously publicize the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.
    But from the current point of view, I feel that the literary and art circles and film and drama workers have not paid enough attention to the publicity of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. In order to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and in order to better promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, I suggest that the literary and art circles compile Hao Jianxiu's deeds into a script welcomed by workers or make a movie to educate everyone.

    文艺工作者
    应注意宣传郝建秀工作法
    编辑同志：郝建秀工作法已经逐渐在全国范围内推广起来了。郝建秀工作法不仅纺织工人应当学习，就是其他工厂的工人也可以学习。这是我国工业方面的一大革新，因此我觉得大力宣传郝建秀工作法是很有必要的。
    但就目前来看，我觉得文艺界及影剧工作者对郝建秀工作法的宣传，尚未予以足够的重视。为了发扬工人阶级的积极性和创造性，为了更好地推广郝建秀工作法，我建议文艺界把郝建秀的事迹编成工人所欢迎的剧本或制成电影，来教育大家。
