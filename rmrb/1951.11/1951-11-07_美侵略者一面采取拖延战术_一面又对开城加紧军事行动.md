Xinhua News Agency, 6th. French "Ce Soir" reporter, Burchett, reported from Kaesong on the 5th: After the Korean-Chinese side proposed a new suggestion on the 4th—if the U.S. side is unwilling to agree to adjust the line of military contact, then the ceasefire line should be established entirely along the battle line, with both sides retreating two kilometers each—they told the U.S. side on the morning of the 5th: If the U.S. side refuses to accept the demilitarized zone in the first suggestion from the Korean-Chinese side—a demilitarized zone that allows both sides to retreat by roughly equal amounts, and does not accept the demilitarized zone established along the line of contact suggested on the 4th, then it can only lead to serious doubts about whether the U.S. side has the sincerity to reach an agreement.

United Nations reporters were shocked on the morning of the 5th when they learned that the U.S. side had requested a recess because of the new suggestion made by the Korean-Chinese side yesterday. They knew nothing about this development. After the reporters told them about this development, they rushed across the road to see Nokes, the spokesman for the United Nations Command delegation, but Nokes flatly denied that the Korean-Chinese side had made such a suggestion. After I quoted the Korean-Chinese side's statement yesterday verbatim, the United Nations reporters were prepared to protest to Nokes for deliberately keeping important news from them. After learning of this new suggestion, the United Nations reporters unanimously believed that it was a "reasonable" suggestion that could break the deadlock.

The reason for the U.S. side's use of delaying tactics is to try to obtain Kaesong for nothing, which has become increasingly clear. On the morning of the 5th, U.S. shells exploded within 700 yards southeast of the Panmunjom security zone and within 1,000 yards south of the road I took from Panmunjom to Kaesong to send this message. Last night, the residents of Kaesong did not sleep all night because of the loud bombardment by U.S. artillery, in support of another attempt by the U.S. side to encircle Kaesong. Taking such military action at this stage of the negotiations, coupled with the unrealistic attitude adopted by its representatives in the tent, can only lead to serious doubts about whether the U.S. side is truly concerned about peace or wants to continue to maintain the military stalemate.

The exploding shells we saw on the morning of the 5th, if there was the slightest error in firing, would cause a serious incident in the 1,000-yard radius neutral zone of Panmunjom. This leads one to begin to doubt whether the U.S. side's intention is precisely this.

    美侵略者一面采取拖延战术
    一面又对开城加紧军事行动
    【新华社六日讯】法国“今晚报”记者贝却敌五日自开城报道：朝中方面在四日提出新建议——假如美方不愿同意调整战斗接触线，那么停火线应完全沿战线建立，双方各后撤两公里——之后，又在五日上午告诉美方说：如果美方拒绝接受朝中方面第一次建议的非军事区——这个非军事区使双方作大体相等的撤退，又不接受四日建议的沿接触线建立的非军事区，那就只能使人严重地怀疑美方是否有获致协议的诚意。
    联合国方面的记者在五日上午知道由于朝中方面昨天提出新建议所以美方才要求休会之后，大吃一惊。他们对这个发展一点也不知道。在记者把这一发展告诉他们之后，他们急忙跑到路那边去见联合国军代表团发言人纳科斯，而纳科斯竟断然否认朝中方面曾提出这种建议。在我把朝中方面昨天的声明一字不差地加以引证之后，联合国方面的记者才准备向纳科斯抗议他故意不让他们知道重要新闻。联合国记者在知道这个新建议后，一致认为这是一个可以打破僵局的“合理的”建议。
    美方使用拖延战术的原因，是企图白白地得到开城，这已越来越清楚了。五日上午，美方的炮弹在板门店安全区东南七百码以内以及在我从板门店到开城拍发这条消息所走的公路以南一千码以内的地方爆炸。昨夜开城居民一夜未睡，因为美军排炮隆隆轰击，以支持美方的又一次包围开城的企图。在谈判的这个阶段采取这种军事行动，加上它的代表在帐篷中所采取的不现实的态度，只能使人严重地怀疑美方是真的关心和平呢，还是想要继续保持军事僵持状态。
    我们在五日上午所看见的爆炸的炮弹，如果在发射时有丝毫差错，就会在半径一千码的板门店中立区内造成严重事件。这使人开始怀疑美方的意图是不是正是这样。
