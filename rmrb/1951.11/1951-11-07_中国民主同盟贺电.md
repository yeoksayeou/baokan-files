    China Democratic League's Congratulatory Telegram
    To Marshal Stalin:
    On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we, on behalf of all members of the China Democratic League, would like to extend our warm congratulations and fraternal greetings to you and the people of the entire Soviet Union!
    The October Revolution marked the beginning of a new era for oppressed and enslaved people around the world to strive for freedom and liberation. We, the Chinese people, were inspired and influenced by the spirit of the October Revolution, which is why we have our victory today. Now we must follow the spirit of the Soviet Union's past revolution and accept the Soviet Union's advanced nation-building experience to engage in construction work. The people of China and the Soviet Union have always had a long-standing friendship. In the future, we will definitely further strengthen the unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union and work hard to safeguard world peace!
    Chairman of the China Democratic League: Zhang Lan
    Vice Chairman: Shen Junru
