    Individual Rural Cadres in Su County Special District, Northern Anhui,
    Embezzle or Misappropriate Patriotic Donation Funds
    Relevant Authorities Should Swiftly Investigate and Handle
    To the Editors: Recently, we conducted an investigation on the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in various counties of the Su County Special District. We found that in some areas, due to lax inspection and supervision by the leadership, donations were not submitted on time. We also discovered that individual township and village cadres took the opportunity to embezzle or misappropriate patriotic donations from the masses. Cao Yuting, a cadre in Xin’xing Township, Qingyang District, Si Hong County, colluded with private merchants using 2 million yuan of the masses’ donations to engage in business together. Xu Xueming, a village cadre in Hu Tai Village, Xinji Township, Xuefeng District, actually used 350,000 yuan of donations for his own wedding expenses. Xu Zuoming, the village head of Xu Chen Village, Xinhe Township, Ping Shan District, Si County, used donations to purchase a donkey. Wang Jinchang, the village head of Yiliyucun Village, Yangding District, Lingbi County, used 300 jin of grain donated by the masses for airplanes and cannons as village office expenses. The above situations have greatly affected the prestige of the People's Government among the masses. In order to prevent similar situations from happening again, I suggest that local leadership organs at all levels should pay serious attention to this issue, quickly check the donation and payment collection work, and in addition to recovering the misappropriated or embezzled funds in full, should give appropriate punishments based on the severity of the circumstances.

    皖北宿县专区个别乡村干部
    贪污或挪用爱国捐献款项
    有关机关应迅速检查处理
    编辑同志：最近我们到宿县专区各县进行抗美援朝工作的调查，发现一部分地区由于领导方面检查督促不严，致使献款未能按时上缴。并发现个别乡、村干部，乘机贪污或挪用群众的爱国献款。泗洪县青阳区新行乡干部曹玉亭，以群众的献款二百万元勾结私商，共同经商。雪枫区新集乡胡台村村干部徐学明，竟以献款三十五万元作为自己的结婚用费。泗县屏山区新河乡许陈村村长许作明，则拿献款购买毛驴一头。灵璧县杨町区一里玉村村长王金场，把群众捐献飞机大炮的粮食三百斤，充作村办公费之用。上述情况，已大大地影响了人民政府在群众中的威信。为了不再有类似情况发生，我建议当地各级领导机关应严重地注意这一问题，迅速检查捐献缴款收款工作，对挪用、贪污事件，除如数追回挪用或贪污的款项外，应分别情节轻重予以适当处理。
