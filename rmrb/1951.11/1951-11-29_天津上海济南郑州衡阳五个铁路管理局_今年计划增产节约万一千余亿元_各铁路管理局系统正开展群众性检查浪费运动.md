Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Hengyang Railway Administrations plan to increase production and save 11.1 trillion yuan for the country before the end of this year. This amount is equivalent to the value of about 740 fighter planes.

This past June, these five railway administrations formulated a plan to increase profits turned over to the state by 578 billion yuan through increased production and economy by the end of the year. This time, in response to Chairman Mao's call, they have formulated a new plan for increasing production and practicing economy. The Tianjin Railway Administration plans to increase production and save 3 trillion yuan, the Shanghai Railway Administration 1.5 trillion yuan, the Jinan Railway Administration 3.5 trillion yuan (excluding 4 trillion yuan in savings on circulating funds and the original plan to increase profits turned over by 2 trillion yuan), the Zhengzhou Railway Administration 1.6 trillion yuan, and the Hengyang Railway Administration 1.5 trillion yuan.

To ensure the realization of the plan, the railway administration systems are now carrying out a movement against waste. The Tianjin Railway Administration, at a joint meeting of bureau chiefs and section chiefs, exposed past wasteful phenomena in the areas of transportation, basic construction projects, materials, and manpower, and decided to continue conducting a widespread and in-depth inspection. In addition, they have formulated measures to strengthen transportation management, basic construction project management, and materials management. The Shanghai Railway Administration's Production Increase and Economy Committee also issued instructions on practicing strict economy not long ago. The instructions pointed out past wasteful phenomena in the areas of business trips, personnel deployment, daily work, meetings, etc., and called on all employees to launch a mass movement to inspect waste.

    天津上海济南郑州衡阳五个铁路管理局
    今年计划增产节约万一千余亿元
    各铁路管理局系统正开展群众性检查浪费运动
    【新华社二十八日讯】天津、上海、济南、郑州、衡阳五个铁路管理局计划在今年年底前为国家增产节约一万一千一百亿元的财富。这笔钱约合七百四十架战斗机的价值。
    今年六月间，这五个铁路管理局曾经订出计划，要用增产节约的方法，在年底增加上缴利润五千七百八十亿元。这次他们响应毛主席的号召，又订出了增产节约计划，其中天津铁路管理局计划增产节约三千亿元上海铁路管理局是一千五百亿元、济南铁路管理局是三千五百亿元（不包括节约流动资金四千亿元和原计划的增加上缴利润二千亿元）、郑州铁路管理局是一千六百亿元、衡阳铁路管理局是一千五百亿元。
    为保证计划的实现，现在各铁路管理局系统正在开展反对浪费的运动。天津铁路管理局在局长、处长联席会议上揭发了过去全局在运输、基本建设工程、材料、人力等方面的浪费现象，并决定继续进行普遍深入的检查；另外，他们已制定了加强运输管理、基本建设工程管理、材料管理的办法。上海铁路管理局增产节约委员会也在不久前发布了厉行节约的指示。指示中指出过去全局在出差、人员调配、日常工作、会议等方面的浪费现象，号召全局职工开展群众性的检查浪费运动。
