Since its opening on October 2nd at the Wenhua Hall in the Forbidden City, the exhibition has been visited by over 38,600 people as of November 12th. This exhibition, combining physical objects and pictures, has played a role in continuing to develop and deepen patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and in calling on everyone to carry out the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice thrift, and to complete and continue to expand the weapon donation campaign, through concrete images. This exhibition was held during the National Day holiday, when international friends gathered in the capital, and there were more than 20 groups of international friends who visited it. Mr. Matthews from Australia wrote after the visit: "A clear and well-organized exhibition, full of the power of facts. It helps us to better understand the Korean War and the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean people. We must do our best to bring peace to Korea and the whole world."
　　▲ The Health Department of the Jung Wang Banner People's Government in the Ikhao League of Suiyuan Province established a Lama medical clinic to unite and transform Lama doctors, so that the disease prevention and control work in the whole banner could be carried out smoothly.
　　Now each of the six districts in Jung Wang Banner has established a Lama medical clinic. More than 40 Lama doctors in the whole banner have participated in the work of the medical clinics, and more than 30 young Lamas have requested to study in the medical clinics. Under the leadership of the Health Department of the Banner People's Government, these Lama doctors vaccinated more than 31,000 of the 40,000 Mongolian and Han people in the whole banner against smallpox this spring, eliminating the smallpox that had spread in the banner for many years. In the summer, they also eradicated the prevailing scabies and malaria in the banner, curing more than 90% of the patients with pyogenic scabies and curing malaria patients in Hongqing Temple, Changhan Zhao, and Gongyi Zhao alone numbering 643.
　　After the establishment of the Lama medical clinics, the Health Department of the Banner People's Government sent special personnel to conduct patriotic education for the Lama doctors participating in the medical clinics, explain national policies, and earnestly help them in their work, teaching them how to give vaccinations, inoculate against smallpox, treat malaria, and treat pyogenic scabies. Some Lama doctors have also learned intravenous injections and have begun to use "606" to treat syphilis for the masses. At present, the Lama medical clinics are carrying out the prevention and control of dysentery.

    ▲绥远省伊克昭盟郡王旗人民政府卫生科建立喇嘛医社，团结、改造喇嘛医生，使全旗疫病防治工作顺利展开。
    现在郡王旗的六个区，每区都建立了一所喇嘛医社。全旗已有四十多个喇嘛医生参加医社工作，并有三十多个青年喇嘛要求进医社学习。这些医社的喇嘛医生，在旗人民政府卫生科的领导下，今年春天为全旗四万多蒙、汉族人民中的三万一千多人接种了牛痘，扑灭了多年来蔓延旗内的天花。夏天，他们又扑灭了旗内流行的疥疮和疟疾，治好全旗脓疥患者百分之九十以上，治好疟疾患者仅红庆庙、昌汗召、宫义召三地就有六百四十三人。
    各喇嘛医社建立后，旗人民政府卫生科曾派专人对参加医社的喇嘛医生进行爱国主义教育，讲解民族政策，并在业务上认真帮助他们，教他们打防疫针、接种牛痘、治疟疾、治脓疥等。有些喇嘛医生还学会静脉注射，开始用“六○六”替群众治疗梅毒。目前各喇嘛医社正在进行赤痢的防治工作。
