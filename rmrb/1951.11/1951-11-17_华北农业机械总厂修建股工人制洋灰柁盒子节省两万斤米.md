To the Editor:
    The workers of the Construction Team of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy. In the past, when they made cement mortar boxes, they used red and white pine lumber (red and white pine is one of the best lumber for construction). Now they are making every effort to utilize waste plow handles and hardwood materials. They have already used waste plow handles and hardwood to make the cement mortar boxes at both ends of the eastern half of the assembly shop, and are now preparing to nail the flat top box panels; the work on the northern cement mortar box panels is also nearing completion. In this way, calculating only the savings on lumber, it is estimated that the state will save 20,000 jin of millet.

    华北农业机械总厂修建股工人制洋灰柁盒子节省两万斤米
    编辑同志：北京华北农业机械总厂修建股工人热烈响应毛主席的增产节约号召。过去，他们制造洋灰柁盒子时，都是用红白松木料（红白松在建筑上是最好的木料之一）。现在他们尽量利用废犁把及硬杂木等材料。他们已用废犁把和硬杂木将装配场东半部两端洋灰柁盒子做好，正着手钉平顶盒子板；北端洋灰柁盒子板的活也将完成了。这样，仅以木料一项计算，估计就会给国家节约两万斤小米。
