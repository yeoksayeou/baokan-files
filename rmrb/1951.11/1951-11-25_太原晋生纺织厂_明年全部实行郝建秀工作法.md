Taiyuan: Jinsheng Textile Factory to Fully Implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Next Year

The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method at the Jinsheng Textile Factory of the Shanxi Provincial Textile Company in Taiyuan has achieved remarkable results, once again proving the significant role of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in increasing production and practicing economy. According to statistics from the first six workers at the factory who learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, their roller waste has been reduced by nearly two-thirds compared to the past, and yarn breakage has been reduced by one-half. In the past, they, like other workers, produced an average of 2.28 pounds of roller waste for every 100 pounds of cotton spun, and there were an average of 2.8 yarn breakages per minute for every 100 spindles. Now, roller waste has been reduced to 0.83 pounds, and yarn breakage has been reduced to 1.4. Other aspects, such as splicing time and roving change time, have also been greatly shortened compared to the past. The Jinsheng Textile Factory has a total of 10,000 spindles (plus 250 looms) and 100 technical workers who supervise the yarn. They plan to fully implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method starting next year, which will increase considerable wealth for the country. If all 10,000 spindles are used to spin 20-count yarn, the full implementation of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method will result in an increase of 161.71 pounds of yarn per day due to reduced roller waste, an increase of more than 4,204 pounds of yarn per month (26 days), and an increase of 50,453.5 pounds of yarn per year. This is equivalent to the daily production of five Jinsheng Textile Factories (each with 10,000 spindles, not counting looms). At a market price of 20,000 yuan per pound of yarn, this amounts to 1,009,070,000 yuan. (Zhao Feng)

    太原晋生纺织厂
    明年全部实行郝建秀工作法
    太原山西省纺织公司晋生纺织厂推行郝建秀工作法已获得显著成绩，又一次证明了郝建秀工作法在增产节约中的重大作用。据该厂第一批学会郝建秀工作法的六个工人的成绩统计，她们的皮辊花已比过去减少近三分之二，断头减少了二分之一。过去，她们也是和其他工友一样，每纺一百磅棉花，平均就要出二·二八磅皮辊花，每一百个锭子，每分钟平均有二·八个断头；而现在皮辊花降为○·八三磅，断头降为一·四个。其它如接头时间、换粗纱时间，也都比过去大为缩短。晋生纺织厂共有一万个纱锭（另有二百五十台布机），一百个看纱车的技术工人，准备从明年开始完全实行郝建秀工作法，这将给国家增加不少的财富。如以一万纱锭全部纺二十支纱计算，他们全部实行郝建秀工作法后，每天即可因为减少皮辊花而增产纱一六一·七一磅，每月（二十六天）可增产纱四千二百零四磅余，每年可增产纱五万零四百五十三磅半，这就等于五个晋生纺织厂（每个一万纱锭，不算布机）一天的生产量。以每磅纱市价二万元计，即合十亿九百零七万元。（赵烽）
