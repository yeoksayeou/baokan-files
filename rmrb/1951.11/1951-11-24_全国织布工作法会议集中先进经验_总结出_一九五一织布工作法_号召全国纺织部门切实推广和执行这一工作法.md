Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 23rd: The National Weaving Work Method Conference held in Tianjin from the 1st to the 21st of this month has summarized a nationally unified and advanced weaving work method. This work method is based on the Hao Jianxiu work method, and concentrates the advanced operational experience and theoretical knowledge of outstanding weaving workers, technicians, engineers, and experts from Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Northeast China. It was summarized after twenty days of demonstrations, observations, measurements, analyses, and discussions. This work method has now been officially named the "1951 Weaving Work Method" by the conference.

The 1951 Weaving Work Method is a powerful weapon for weaving workers across the country to improve labor productivity, reduce and eliminate waste, and realize Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy. At present, there is significant waste in cotton yarn usage, labor organization, and equipment utilization rates in weaving work across the country. For example, the average rate of substandard cloth is above 4 percent, and in some areas it even reaches about 10 percent. The efficiency of weaving machines in most parts of the country is only 85 percent, which is about 10 percent lower than the efficiency achieved by outstanding weaving workers. The characteristics of the 1951 Weaving Work Method are the prevention of yarn breakage, reduction of substandard cloth, and improvement of production efficiency. The work is regular and planned, turning workers from passive to active, and from being controlled by machines to controlling machines. During operation, workers can be unhurried, methodical, and can increase production and improve quality. If the 1951 Weaving Work Method is implemented nationwide, reducing the substandard cloth rate to 2 percent and increasing weaving efficiency by 2 percent, weaving workers across the country can increase production and save the nation wealth equivalent to more than 70 million catties of millet in one year, which can buy about 47 fighter planes. Implementing this work method can also improve workers' ability to manage more looms. This can save labor and solve the difficulty of insufficient skilled workers for all weaving factories across the country to simultaneously operate three shifts. Implementing this work method also prepares favorable conditions for formulating new and more reasonable quotas, reforming wages, and implementing economic accounting systems.

The 1951 Weaving Work Method includes both automatic loom work methods and ordinary loom work methods, suitable for promotion throughout the country. Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, pointed out at the National Weaving Work Method Conference: Effectively promoting and implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method is the central task of the national textile sector in 1952. Therefore, all textile workers, trade union cadres, administrative personnel, and technical workers should include this work method in their patriotic pacts, launch patriotic competitions, respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy, improve the production level of the textile industry, and strive for greater victories on the textile front in 1952. Chen Shaomin pointed out that promoting the 1951 Weaving Work Method must overcome difficulties. The leadership organizations of administration, Communist Party branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth League branches in each factory must pay attention to this work method, strengthen leadership, conduct in-depth publicity to the masses of workers, and break down some of the conservative ideas among the workers. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members should play a leading role in the promotion work. When implementing this work method, the administrative departments of each factory should be responsible for doing a good job in maintenance and preparation, further promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method to improve the quality of yarn and more effectively reduce substandard cloth. At the same time, the administrative departments of each factory should improve the temperature and humidity of the workshops to protect the health of employees.

This conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China. The conference passed a letter to weaving maintenance, preparation, and spinning workers across the country, and rewarded the creators of the 1951 Weaving Work Method - representatives from Northeast China, Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other regions. All the representatives of the conference also wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting the achievements of the conference and expressing their determination to overcome all difficulties, promote this work method, create a large amount of wealth for the country, and complete the glorious task of increasing production and practicing economy.

    全国织布工作法会议集中先进经验
    总结出“一九五一织布工作法”
    号召全国纺织部门切实推广和执行这一工作法
        【新华社天津二十三日电】本月一日至二十一日在天津举行的全国织布工作法会议已总结出全国统一的先进织布工作法。这一工作法是这次会议以郝建秀工作法为基础，集中了青岛、上海、天津和东北等地区的优秀织布工人和技师、工程师、专家的先进操作经验和理论知识，经过二十天的表演、观察、测定、分析和讨论总结出来的。这一工作法现已由会议定名为“一九五一织布工作法”。
    一九五一织布工作法是今后全国织布工人提高劳动生产率、减少和消灭浪费现象、实现毛主席增产节约号召的一个有力武器。目前全国各地的织布工作，在棉纱使用、劳动力组织和设备利用率等方面都有很大浪费。如次布率平均在百分之四以上，个别地区甚至达到百分之十左右；全国多数地区的织布机效率只发挥到百分之八十五，比优秀织布工人所发挥的织布机效率相差百分之十左右。一九五一织布工作法的特点就是预防断头、减少次布、提高生产效率，工作有规律有计划，使工人由被动变为主动，由被机器支配变为支配机器。在操作时，工人可以不慌不忙，有条有理，又能增加生产，提高质量。如果全国实行一九五一织布工作法，使次布率减低到百分之二，织布效率提高百分之二，全国织布工人一年就可给国家增产节约价值等于七千多万斤小米的财富，大约可购买四十七架战斗机。实行这一工作法也能提高工人看台（织布机）能力。这就可以节省出劳动力，为全国织布厂一齐开三班解决熟练工人不足的困难。实行这一工作法还可为制订新的更合理的定额、改革工资、实行经济核算制准备了有利条件。
    一九五一织布工作法包括自动布机工作法和普通布机工作法两部分，适合在全国各地推行。中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏在全国织布工作法会议上讲话时指出：切实推广和执行郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布法是全国纺织部门一九五二年的中心工作。因此全体纺织工人、工会干部、行政人员、和技术工作者应当把这一工作订到爱国公约中，展开爱国主义竞赛，响应毛主席增产节约的号召，提高纺织工业的生产水平，争取一九五二年在纺织战线上取得更大的胜利。陈少敏指出：推行一九五一织布工作法必须克服困难，各厂行政、共产党支部、工会、青年团支部的领导组织必须重视这一工作法，加强领导，向工人群众进行深入宣传，打破工人群众中的某些保守思想。共产党员、青年团员更应在推广工作中起带头骨干作用。在实行这一工作法时，各厂行政方面要负责做好保全工作和准备工作，进一步推广郝建秀工作法，以提高纱的质量，更有效地减少次布。同时各厂行政方面应改善车间的温湿度，保护职工的健康。
    这次会议是由中央人民政府纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会联合召开的。会议通过了给全国织布保全、准备和细纱工人的信，奖励了一九五一织布工作法的创造者——东北、青岛、上海、天津等地区的代表。会议全体代表并上书毛主席，报告会议的成就，表示决心克服一切困难，推广这一工作法，为国家创造大量财富，完成增产节约的光荣任务。
