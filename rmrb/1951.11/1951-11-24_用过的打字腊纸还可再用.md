    Used Stencil Paper Can Be Reused
    Editor: The staff of the Document Section Printing Group of the General Bureau of Electricity Management of the Central Fuel Industry Department are responding to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" with practical actions. They felt that discarding printed stencil paper was a wasteful practice. Therefore, they devised a method to gently absorb the ink on the stencil paper with old paper, and then pad it on both sides with old paper before storing it. In this way, the clarity of the next reprint is exactly the same as before. They have been using this method for more than half a month, and the results are very good, saving labor and time, and there are no difficulties. We believe that this improvement will promote the conservation movement in document printing work. Therefore, we are willing to introduce this experience to relevant departments for reference.

    用过的打字腊纸还可再用
    编辑同志：中央燃料工业部电业管理总局文书科文印组职工，以实际行动响应毛主席的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召。他们感到过去把印过的打字腊纸随手丢弃，实在是一种浪费的行为。于是，他们想出办法，将印过的打字腊纸，用旧纸轻轻吸去腊纸上的油墨，再用旧纸双面衬垫，然后把它保存起来。这样，下次拿出来复印时，清晰程度与以前的完全相同。他们用上项办法，已经实行了半个多月，成绩很好，节省了人工、时间，而且也没有什么困难。我们觉得这一改进，对文印工作中的节约运动是有推动作用的。因此，我们愿意把这个经验介绍给有关部门作为参考。　电业管理总局文书科
