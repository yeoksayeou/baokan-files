How the Northern Sichuan District Exceeded its Donation Plan
Sun Futian

The Northern Sichuan Administrative District was the first province-level region in the country to exceed its donation plan.

The Northern Sichuan Administrative District has a population of fifteen million. In late September, the people of the entire district completed the original plan to donate twenty-seven "New Northern Sichuan" fighter planes. By October 10, the district had paid 57.97 billion yuan, equivalent to more than thirty-eight fighter planes.

The smooth progress of the donation campaign in the Northern Sichuan District was based on thorough patriotic propaganda and education. At the beginning of the campaign, each city and county held one or two representative conferences of the county (city), district, and township levels to conduct patriotic education for the representatives of the masses and mobilize them to promote the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. At the same time, the entire district organized more than 420,000 cadres and activists to listen to reports from representatives of returning volunteers and representatives of visiting delegations to Korea, and conveyed them to the broad masses. Various regular propaganda and education organizations also developed greatly. For example, in Nanbu and Yilong counties, the number of propagandists of the Chinese Communist Party reached 5,077. Nanbu County established 4,995 night schools with more than 150,000 students; established 1,667 blackboard newspapers, 742 rooftop broadcasting stations, and 5,528 reading groups. The circulation of various newspapers increased from 4,870 copies to 8,779 copies; more than 43,000 copies of materials on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea were sold. In addition, many areas used various exhibitions and performances for propaganda. For example, the exhibitions on increasing production and donation and patriotic covenants held in Yanting and Suining counties were of great educational significance to the masses. The five cultural service teams of the Northern Sichuan People's Administrative Office went to remote rural areas and ethnic minority areas, conducting propaganda to more than 360,000 people in 172 townships in 33 counties, which simultaneously set off a climax of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in remote mountain villages and ethnic minority areas.

Another important reason for the smooth progress of the donation campaign in the Northern Sichuan District was that the leading organs were able to combine the work of increasing production and donation with the current central task, and promote the donation work through patriotic covenants. The campaign for increasing production and donation in the district began at the same time as the second phase of land reform. The leading organs first conducted education among cadres at all levels, overcame the "single-handed" work style and the "purely economic viewpoint," and strengthened the leadership of the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the land reform. Many heads of land reform work teams personally took the lead, leading all cadres to first make patriotic covenants and donation plans; and implement patriotic education for farmers into the actual work of land reform.

On the basis of patriotic education and class education, all localities generally mobilized the masses to make patriotic covenants by cultivating typical examples and focusing on promotion, and included the plan to increase production and donation as an important part of the patriotic covenants. By the end of September, more than half of the families in the district had made patriotic covenants; in Nanbu, Yilong and other 19 counties, the population participating in the patriotic covenants accounted for 70 percent of the population of each county. The signing of patriotic covenants promoted the production movement of the people in the entire district. For example, 94 silk weaving factories in Nanchong City improved labor-capital relations and improved production efficiency by checking patriotic covenants and signing labor-capital increase production and donation contracts. Each loom can increase the production of two pieces of silk per day. Farmers in the entire district actively improved farming techniques, and extensively dug weirs, built ponds, caught insects, and prevented disasters, with an average increase in grain production of 20 percent in the entire district. In this way, the movement to increase production and donation truly achieved the goals of supporting the front, consolidating national defense, promoting national construction, and improving people's lives, thereby further increasing the enthusiasm of the masses.

During the payment phase of the donation campaign, the Northern Sichuan District created the method of "Great Donation Day." This played a great role in inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses and ensuring the completion of the increase production and donation plan on schedule or ahead of schedule. The "Great Donation Day" in various places is generally held in conjunction with various commemorative festivals, based on the production season and the mass production increase. Propaganda and mobilization are carried out in advance to prepare the masses, and a wide venue is selected as a donation station, a propaganda team is organized to carry out on-site mobilization, and a donation exhibition is held to announce the donation figures and increase production achievements of the masses at any time, and the masses are organized to speak on stage in a planned manner, and models are commended. In many areas, before the "Great Donation Day," the masses prepared like the New Year: checking patriotic covenants; summarizing the achievements of increasing production; preparing to donate cash and materials. On the day of the donation, the masses, holding banknotes, carrying grain, twisting秧歌, beating gongs and drums, and holding high the red flag with patriotic slogans, walked in groups to the donation station. In this way, the movement to donate weapons has formed an extremely enthusiastic patriotic action.

At present, people from all walks of life in Northern Sichuan are holding representative conferences or commendation meetings to celebrate the victory of the movement to increase production and donation, and to arrange various tasks for further developing the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Many counties have organized work teams to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which go to various districts and townships to carry out propaganda, and specifically check and help the masses revise and make patriotic covenants, summarize the experience of increasing production, carry out winter increase production movement, and improve preferential treatment work, so as to make the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea universally deep and improve.

　　川北区是怎样超额完成捐献计划的
    孙福田
    川北行署区在全国省区中是第一个超额完成捐献计划的。
    川北行署区，人口一千五百万。九月下旬，全区人民即提前完成了原定捐献“新川北号战斗机大队”飞机二十七架的计划。到十月十日，全区缴款已达五百七十九亿七千万元。折合战斗机三十八架多。
    川北区捐献运动的顺利开展，是建立在充分的爱国主义宣传教育工作基础上的。运动开始时，各市、县普遍召开了一次或两次县（市）、区、乡抗美援朝代表会议，向群众中的代表人物进行了爱国主义教育，动员他们去推动抗美援朝工作。同时，全区组织了四十二万多干部与积极分子听取了志愿军归国代表和赴朝慰问团代表的报告，并向广大群众作了传达。各种经常的宣传教育组织也大量发展。如南部、仪陇两县，中国共产党的宣传员发展到了五千零七十七人。南部全县建立了四千九百九十五所夜校，入学群众达十五万余人；建立了一千六百六十七块黑板报，七百四十二处屋顶广播和五千五百二十八个读报组。各种报纸的发行量由四千八百七十份增加到了八千七百七十九份；抗美援朝读物推销了四万三千多册。此外，许多地区并利用各种展览会和演出来进行宣传。如盐亭、遂宁等县举行的增产捐献和爱国公约展览会，对群众的教育意义很大。川北人民行政公署的五个文化服务队，分赴各偏远乡村和少数民族地区，在三十三个县的一百七十二个乡，向三十六万多人作了宣传，使偏远山村和少数民族地区，同时掀起了抗美援朝运动的高潮。
    川北区捐献运动顺利开展的又一重要原因，是领导机关能把增产捐献工作与当前中心工作结合进行，并通过爱国公约来推动捐献工作。该区的增产捐献运动与第二期土地改革工作是同时开始的。领导机关首先在各级干部中进行了教育，克服了“单打一”的工作作风和“单纯经济观点”，在土地改革中同时加强抗美援朝工作的领导。许多土地改革工作团的负责人都亲自带头，领导全体干部首先订出爱国公约和捐献计划；并把对农民的爱国主义教育，贯彻到土地改革的实际工作中去。
    在爱国主义教育和阶级教育的基础上，各地都以培养典型、重点推广的方法，普遍发动群众订立了爱国公约，并把增产捐献计划列为爱国公约的重要内容之一。到九月下旬为止，全区半数以上家庭都订立了爱国公约；南部、仪陇等十九县，参加订立爱国公约的人口已占各县人口的百分之七十。爱国公约的订立推动了全区人民的增产运动。如南充市丝织业九十四家工厂，通过检查爱国公约和订立劳资增产捐献合同，改善了劳资关系，提高了生产效率，每张织机每天可增产两匹绸子。全区农民积极改进耕作技术，并大量挖堰、筑塘、捕虫、防灾，全区平均增产粮食达百分之二十。这样，就使增产捐献运动真正达到了支援前线、巩固国防、推动国家建设和改善人民生活的目的，因而更加提高了群众的积极性。
    在捐献运动的缴款阶段，川北区又创造了“大捐献日”的办法。这对鼓舞群众爱国热情，保证按期或提前完成增产捐献计划起了很大的推动作用。各地的“大捐献日”，一般是结合各种纪念节日，根据生产季节和群众增产情况来举行的。事先进行宣传动员，让群众作好准备，并选择宽广场所作捐献站，组织宣传队进行现场鼓动，同时还举行捐献展览，随时宣布群众的捐献数字和增产成绩，有准备地组织群众登台讲话，并表扬模范。许多地区在“大捐献日”以前，群众就像过年一样准备起来：检查爱国公约；总结增产的成绩；准备捐献现款和实物。到了捐献日那天，群众拿着钞票，挑着粮食，扭着秧歌，打着锣鼓，高举着写上了爱国口号的红旗，成群结队地走向捐献站。这样，就把捐献武器运动形成了一种极为热烈的爱国主义行动。
    目前川北各地各界人民正纷纷召开抗美援朝代表会议或表扬模范庆功大会，庆祝增产捐献运动的胜利，和布置进一步开展抗美援朝运动的各项工作。许多县份组织了抗美援朝工作团，分别到各区乡进行宣传，并具体检查和帮助群众修订与订立爱国公约、总结增产经验、开展冬季增产运动，改进优抚工作，以便使抗美援朝运动普遍深入和提高一步。
