　　Benxi Jiandong Lime Kiln Manager Liu Zhongjie
    Successfully Created a Sieve Ash Machine, Saving 40 Tons of Grain Annually
    Editor: Liu Zhongjie, manager of the state-owned Jiandong Lime Kiln in Benxi City, Northeast China, in order to improve the quantity and quality of products to meet the needs of economic construction, successfully created a sieve ash machine on September 10, thereby increasing production efficiency sevenfold. In the past, workers in the factory used hand sieves to sieve lime – each person could only sieve a little over one ton per day, and it was easy to damage the workers’ health. Since the increase production and practice economy movement was launched in the factory, Liu Zhongjie has been using his brain and determined to manufacture a sieve ash machine to overcome the difficulties of hand sieving ash. After more than twenty days of continuous experimentation, he finally succeeded. According to current test results, the sieve ash machine not only does not hinder the health of workers, but also each machine can sieve more than eight tons of lime per day. If calculated on the basis of eight tons per day per machine, the labor costs saved by three sieve ash machines in one year are equivalent to 40 tons of grain.　Chen Dixin

　　本溪建东石灰窑经理刘仲杰
    创制筛灰机成功每年可节省粮食四十吨
    编辑同志：东北本溪市公营建东石灰窑经理刘仲杰，为了提高产品数量、质量，以供应经济建设的需要，于九月十日创制筛灰机成功，生产效率因而提高七倍。过去，该厂工人用手筛子筛石灰——每天每人只能筛一吨多，并且容易损害工人的健康。自增产节约运动在该厂展开后，刘仲杰便开动脑筋，决心要制造一台筛灰机，克服以前手筛灰的困难。经过二十余天的不断试验，终于获得成功。据目前试验结果，筛灰机不但不会妨碍工人健康，而且一台机每天可筛石灰八吨以上。若按一台机日产八吨计算，则三台筛灰机在一年内所节省的人工费，折合粮食四十吨。　陈涤新
