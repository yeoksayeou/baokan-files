(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st) Lu Xingyuan, Director of the Works Department of the East China and Shanghai People's Broadcasting Stations, was corrupt and seriously damaged state property and the interests of the people. The People's Supervision Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee issued a notice on the 19th, removing Lu Xingyuan from his post and recommending that the East China judicial organs punish him according to law. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also published a decision in Shanghai newspapers on the same day regarding the expulsion of Lu Xingyuan from the Party.

Lu Xingyuan was from Linyi County, Shandong Province. He joined the revolution in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi, in 1938, and joined the Communist Party of China in August of the same year. Lu previously served as the radio station captain of the Independent Guerrilla Detachment of the 359th Brigade of the Eighteenth Group Army, the radio station captain of the Shandong Dazhong Daily, and the deputy director of the Nanjing People's Broadcasting Station. In August 1950, he was transferred to the post of Director of the Works Department and concurrently Head of the Broadcasting Equipment Section of the East China and Shanghai People's Broadcasting Stations, specifically responsible for the technical management and equipment procurement of People's Broadcasting Stations in various parts of the East China region. Because Lu Xingyuan's selfish and individualistic thinking was not well transformed after joining the revolution, and after entering a big city, he could not withstand the erosion of corrupt ideas and the influence of a luxurious lifestyle, which fostered serious hedonistic thinking, and finally developed to the point of degeneration and deterioration. During the nine months that Lu Xingyuan was in office in Shanghai, he used his position to carry out a series of embezzlement and fraudulent activities. It has now been verified that he stole and sold radio equipment and embezzled more than 247 million yuan in public funds. In September 1950, Lu Xingyuan met the unscrupulous merchant Li Dewei (manager of Shanghai Diantong Auction House, who had served as a detective in the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau) due to equipment purchasing. Lu was then frequently invited to banquets, went to dance halls, and accepted bribes. In the spring of this year, under the enticement of Li Dewei, Lu Xingyuan spent a huge sum of 30 million yuan to rent two houses, living with the female drug dealer Feng Ping and the waitress Wang Lanzhen, respectively. At this point, Lu Xingyuan had completely degenerated and deteriorated. He not only tried his best to protect the illegal behavior of the unscrupulous merchant Li Dewei in breaching the contract and failing to deliver goods to the radio station, but also secretly used the seal of the radio station's service department to introduce Feng Ping to work at the Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station in order to engage in speculation. In the process of degeneration and depravity, Lu Xingyuan felt that the revolutionary ranks were strictly disciplined, envied the "freedom" of businessmen, and, in addition, had already embezzled a large sum of money, so he attempted to break away from the revolution. In January of this year, Lu used embezzled funds to buy a small generator and asked his cousin to prepare to open a noodle shop in Xuzhou, but it was delayed due to difficulties in connecting to electricity. In May, when the heads of the East China and Shanghai People's Broadcasting Stations discovered Lu Xingyuan's corrupt and degenerate behavior, Lu not only showed no remorse, but also moved all the privately hidden equipment and embezzled clothes to the home of his concubine Wang Lanzhen, attempting to break away from the revolution and escape legal sanctions.

In view of the fact that Lu Xingyuan's corrupt behavior had seriously damaged the interests of the state and the people, the East China and Shanghai People's Broadcasting Stations immediately reported the matter to the public security and judicial organs of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and detained Lu Xingyuan for interrogation. After several months of thorough investigation, the evidence of Lu Xingyuan's crimes was conclusive, and Lu had confessed to his crimes. In order to enforce discipline, the People's Supervision Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee decided to give Lu Xingyuan a dismissal punishment and send him to judicial organs for punishment according to law. The East China People's Supervision Committee believes that the Lu Xingyuan incident proves that the leading cadres of the East China and Shanghai People's Broadcasting Stations have committed serious bureaucracy, but after the incident, they were able to actively investigate, recognize their responsibilities, conduct self-criticism, and request punishment, so they were given a lighter punishment, and the director of the station, Zhou Xinwu, was given a warning. The People's Supervision Committee suggested that the judicial organs punish the unscrupulous merchants Li Dewei and Feng Ping, who induced government cadres to engage in speculation, according to law.

In order to enforce Party discipline and purify the Party organization, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to expel Lu Xingyuan from the Party and notify all Party members in the city.

Shanghai Jiefang Daily published an editorial on the 19th, calling on Communist Party members and revolutionary workers in the entire East China region to conduct a thorough ideological reckoning, oppose corrupt ideas, cultivate a clean and simple work style of serving the people, and fight to defend state property and the purity of Party and state organs.

    路星元贪污腐化严重损害国家人民利益
    已被撤销职务开除党籍并送司法机关惩办 【新华社上海二十一日电】华东、上海人民广播电台工务室主任路星元贪污腐化，严重地损害了国家财产和人民利益。华东军政委员会人民监察委员会已于十九日通报撤销路星元的职务，并建议华东司法机关依法惩处。中共上海市委员会纪律检查委员会也于同日在上海各报发布了关于开除路星元党籍的决定。
    路星元，山东省临沂县人。一九三八年在陕北延安参加革命，同年八月参加中国共产党。路曾任十八集团军三五九旅独立游击支队电台队长、山东大众日报社电台队长、南京人民广播电台副台长等职。一九五零年八月调任华东、上海人民广播电台工务室主任兼广播器材科科长，专门负责对华东区各地人民广播电台的技术管理和采购器材的工作。由于路星元的自私自利个人主义思想在参加革命后没有得到很好的改造，进入大城市后，经不起腐化思想的侵蚀和奢侈生活的影响，滋长了严重的享乐思想，终于发展到蜕化变质的程度。路星元在上海任职的九个月期间，利用自己的职务，进行了一连串的贪污舞弊的活动。现已查明的，计盗卖无线电器材和贪污公款达二亿四千七百多万元。一九五零年九月，路星元因购买器材关系，和奸商李德维（上海电通拍卖行经理，曾当过伪上海警察局侦探）结识后，路即经常应邀赴宴，出入舞厅，收受贿赂。今年春天，路星元在李德维的引诱下，先后以三千万元的巨款，租房两处，分别同贩过毒品的女奸商冯萍和女招待王兰珍姘居。至此，路星元已完全蜕化变质，他不仅竭力袒护奸商李德维违约不向电台交货的违法行为，并窃用电台服务部印信，介绍冯萍去广州人民广播电台工作，以便进行投机活动，路星元在蜕化堕落的过程中，觉得革命队伍纪律严格，羡慕商人“自由”，加以自己已贪污了一笔巨款，就企图脱离革命。今年一月间，路以贪污款项买了一部小发电机，托其堂弟在徐州筹备开设面坊，后因接电困难，致拖延未成。五月间，华东、上海人民广播电台负责人发觉路星元的贪污腐化的错误行为时，路不但毫无悔改之意，反将私藏器材和贪污衣物全部搬到姘妇王兰珍家中，企图脱离革命，逃避法纪制裁。
    华东、上海人民广播电台鉴于路星元的贪污腐化行为已经严重地损害了国家和人民的利益，当即报告上海市人民政府公安、司法机关，将路星元扣押审讯。经数月来的周密调查，路星元的罪行证据确凿，路亦已供认不讳。华东军政委员会人民监察委员会为了严肃法纪，决定给予路星元以撤职处分，并送司法机关依法惩办。华东人民监察委员会认为，路星元事件证明华东、上海人民广播电台的领导干部犯有严重的官僚主义，但事后尚能积极查究，认清责任，进行检讨，并自请处分，故从轻议处，给予该台台长周新武以警告处分。人民监察委员会对于引诱人民政府干部、进行投机活动的奸商李德维、冯萍等，则建议司法机关依法惩办。
    中共上海市委员会纪律检查委员会为了严肃党纪、纯洁党的组织，决定开除路星元党籍，并通报全市党员。
    上海解放日报在十九日发表了社论，号召华东全区的共产党员和革命工作人员，应从思想上进行彻底的清算，反对贪污腐化的思想，养成为人民服务的廉洁朴素的作风，为保卫国家财产，保卫党和国家机关的纯洁而斗争。
