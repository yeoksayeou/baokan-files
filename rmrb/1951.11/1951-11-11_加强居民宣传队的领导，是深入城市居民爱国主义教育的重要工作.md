    Strengthening Leadership of Resident Propaganda Teams is an Important Task for Deepening Patriotic Education Among Urban Residents
    The resident propaganda teams, organized by residential area in the city, are a very important force in popularizing and deepening patriotic education among urban residents. Resident propaganda teams are organizations of activists from all strata of urban people who emerged during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. They live among the masses, are familiar with their lives, and have frequent and close contact with them. Therefore, on the one hand, they can bring the calls and instructions of the government, the Party, and people's organizations to all strata of the masses in a timely and in-depth manner, and lead the masses to realize them together. On the other hand, they can concentrate the wishes and demands of all strata of the masses and reflect them to the relevant leading organs. Facts have proved that the extensive organization of urban resident propaganda teams is the best kind of school for leading organs to cultivate and educate activists; it is the main reliance for the regularized mass propaganda work in the city, and it is a strong grassroots organization that is indispensable for further deepening patriotic education among urban residents.
    However, until now, the important role of urban resident propaganda teams has not been universally valued. Although a large number of capable activists have emerged in some places during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the leading organs there have not chosen an appropriate organizational form to grasp and cultivate and educate them. Some people feel that organizing activists into resident propaganda teams is only needed when carrying out some large-scale propaganda activities, and is dispensable at other times. Therefore, some places do not have resident propaganda team organizations to this day. Some places have been established, but due to lack of leadership, they gradually lose their effectiveness shortly after being established. In some places where propaganda teams have already been established, the leading organs are not good at organizing and unifying the leadership of the propaganda teams. They cannot give full play to the enthusiasm of the organ propagandists to strengthen the leadership of the resident propaganda teams, and they cannot fully rely on the grassroots organizations of the public security departments to give the resident propaganda teams various specific assistance. In some places, the leadership work of the resident propaganda teams is only temporarily entrusted to one or two people to do as an aside. Therefore, in many places, the political enthusiasm of the propaganda team members to learn and work cannot be satisfied. To this end, we suggest that the leading organs of the city should regard the organization of resident propaganda teams as a school for cultivating and educating activists, and should try to unify various effective forces to further strengthen the work of the resident propaganda teams. This is the primary issue in strengthening the leadership of resident propaganda teams.
    The second issue in strengthening the leadership of resident propaganda teams is to fully use the strength of organ propagandists. Some places have fixedly assigned organ propagandists to work in certain resident propaganda teams as instructors. The propagandists who serve as instructors explain current affairs issues or central work to the designated propaganda teams once a week or every two weeks. This practice is absolutely necessary. This not only enables the resident propaganda teams to receive regular leadership, but also, because organ propagandists can often meet with the masses, it actually promotes the connection between the people and the government, the Party, and people's organizations. We suggest that in order to strengthen the leadership of resident propaganda teams, all organs, regardless of level, that are objectively capable must send their own propagandists to participate in the leadership work of resident propaganda teams under the unified leadership of the local Party committee. We believe that the phenomenon that some comrades use the excuse of being busy with their work to shirk or refuse to participate in the leadership work of propaganda teams is wrong and should be corrected.
    The third issue in strengthening the leadership of resident propaganda teams is to obtain various specific assistance from the local public security department's police stations. People know that police stations are the government agencies in the city that are closest to the masses and maintain the closest contact with the masses, and they enjoy a high prestige among the residents. Their specific assistance is of great help to the development of propaganda work. At the same time, the experience of many places has proved that the public security organs actively lead and participate in the mass propaganda work, which can enable the public security work to obtain the assistance of the broad masses. In order to strengthen the leadership of resident propaganda teams, we suggest that public security police stations in various places should regard participating in and leading the work of resident propaganda teams as an indispensable part of their daily work.

    加强居民宣传队的领导，是深入城市居民爱国主义教育的重要工作
    在城市中以居住地段为单位所组成的居民宣传队，是目前普及和深入城市居民爱国主义教育的一支很重要的力量。居民宣传队是城市各阶层人民在抗美援朝运动中涌现的积极分子自己的组织，他们和群众生活在一起，并熟悉群众的生活，和群众有着经常的密切的联系。因此，他们一方面能够把政府、党和人民团体的号召和指示深入及时地带到各阶层群众中去和群众一道领导群众来实现它；一方面又能集中各阶层群众的愿望，要求反映给有关的领导机关。事实证明：广大的城市居民宣传队的组织，是领导机关培养和教育积极分子的最好的一种学校；是城市群众宣传工作经常化的主要的依靠，是进一步深入城市居民爱国主义教育所不可缺少的坚强的基层组织。
    但是，直到现在，城市居民宣传队的重要作用还并没有引起普遍的重视。有些地方在抗美援朝运动中虽然也出现了大批能干的积极分子，但那里的领导机关却没有选择一个适当的组织形式抓紧培养、教育他们。有些人觉得把积极分子组织为居民宣传队这件事，只是在需要进行什么大规模宣传活动的时候才用得着的，平常则是可有可无的，因而有些地方到现在还没有居民宣传队的组织。有的地方虽然是已经建立了，但由于缺乏领导，建立之后不久，就逐渐失去作用。还有一些已经建立宣传队的地方，因为领导机关还不善于组织和统一宣传队的领导力量，他们还不能发挥机关宣传员的积极性以加强对居民宣传队的领导，还不能充分依靠公安部门的基层组织给居民宣传队以各种具体的帮助。有的地方的居民宣传队的领导工作只是临时委托一两个人附带作作。因此，在很多地方宣传队员要求学习、要求工作的政治热情不能得到满足。为此，我们建议，城市的领导机关应该把居民宣传队的组织看作是培养和教育积极分子的学校，应该设法统一各种有效的力量进一步地加强居民宣传队的工作。这是加强居民宣传队领导的首要问题。
    加强居民宣传队的领导的第二个问题，就是要充分使用机关宣传员的力量。有些地方把机关宣传员固定地派到一定的居民宣传队担任指导员的工作；担任指导员职务的宣传员，每周或每两周向所指定的宣传队讲解一次时事问题或中心工作。这种作法，是完全必要的。这样不但能使居民宣传队得到经常的领导，而且由于机关宣传员能够经常和群众见面，实际上就促进了人民群众和政府、党与人民团体的联系。我们建议，为了加强对居民宣传队的领导，无论属于那一级的机关，凡是客观上有可能的，必须派出自己的宣传员，在当地党委统一领导之下，参加居民宣传队的领导工作。有些同志藉口自己工作忙而推托或拒绝担任参加宣传队领导工作的现象，我们认为是不对的，是应该纠正的。
    加强居民宣传队领导的第三个问题，就是要取得当地公安部门派出所的各种具体的帮助。人们知道，派出所是城市中最接近群众并和群众保有最密切接触的政府机关，它在居民群众中享有很高的威望。他们的具体帮助，对于宣传工作的开展有很大的作用，同时，有很多地方的经验证明，公安机关积极领导和参加了群众的宣传工作，可以使治安工作取得了广大群众的协助。为了加强对居民宣传队的领导，我们建议，各地公安派出所应该把参加和领导居民宣传队的工作，作为自己日常工作的不可缺少的内容。
