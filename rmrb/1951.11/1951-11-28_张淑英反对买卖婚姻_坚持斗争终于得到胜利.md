    Zhang Shuying Opposes Arranged Marriage and Achieves Victory Through Persistent Struggle
    Zhang Wenzuo, from Xindian in the 14th District of suburban Beijing, sought to acquire the fifteen mu of land and nine houses belonging to Zhang Yongshun, a mute from Nangaocun in the 10th District. Four years ago, he married his fifteen-year-old daughter, Zhang Shuying, to Zhang Yongshun. Zhang Shuying only realized her husband was mute after the marriage. From then on, she lived a life of silence. After liberation, Zhang Shuying's awareness increased, and she joined the New Democratic Youth League.
    This April, Zhang Shuying's mute husband died. Her father wanted to profit from Shuying again and immediately found her another match in Xindian. He only told Zhang Shuying about it on the day of the wedding. Zhang Shuying firmly opposed it, saying, "Whoever found him can marry him; I'm not going. My marriage to Zhang Yongshun was your decision. This time, it won't work. I want to follow the Marriage Law and manage my own affairs!" Her father threatened her, saying, "If you don't agree to this marriage, I won't recognize you as my daughter, and you can forget about setting foot in my house."
    However, Zhang Shuying persisted in her struggle, and although her family ignored her, she did not give in.
    Zhang Shuying finally achieved victory. She freely married a young farmer. After the marriage, they lived a happy life, keeping their fields completely weed-free. This year, their grain harvest was one-third larger than in previous years. In response to the government's call, they also made a production increase plan. Zhang Shuying's complexion used to be thin and yellow, but now it is plump and red. She said, "The Communist Party saved me. In the future, I will definitely study harder and work harder."

　　实现男女平等，争取婚姻自由！
    张淑英反对买卖婚姻  坚持斗争终于得到胜利
    北京郊外第十四区辛店的张文左，企图得到第十区南皋村哑叭张永顺的十五亩地和九间房子，四年前把十五岁的女儿张淑英嫁给了张永顺。张淑英结婚后才知道自己的丈夫是哑叭。从那时起，她就一直过着不说话的日子。解放后，张淑英觉悟提高了，她加入了新民主主义青年团。
    今年四月，张淑英的哑叭丈夫死了。她父亲又想从淑英身上再发一笔财，立刻在辛店又给她找了一个对象。要结婚的那天，才告诉张淑英。张淑英坚决反对，她说：“你们谁找的谁去，反正我不去。我嫁给张永顺，就是你们作主的。这回可不行了。我要按照婚姻法办事，我自己的事自己管！”她父亲威逼她说：“你要是不答应这门亲事，我就不承认你是我的姑娘，你也别想登我的门。”
    但是张淑英一直坚持斗争，虽然她娘家的人都不理她了，她也没有屈服。
    张淑英终于胜利了。她和一个青年农民自由结婚了。婚后，他俩过着幸福的日子，地里收拾得一点草也没有，今年打的粮食比往年多了三分之一。为了响应政府的号召，他俩还订了增产计划。张淑英的脸色以前又瘦又黄，现在又胖又红。她说：“共产党救了我，今后我一定更加努力学习，努力工作。”
