    【新华社十五日讯】缅甸和印尼的华侨归国观光团于十一日、十四日先后离开北京南下。两观光团中的一部分团员将往福建侨乡参观，一部分团员即取道广州分别返回缅甸和印尼。
    两个观光团在北京参加国庆节庆祝典礼后，曾往东北的沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、大连等地，参观了公私营工厂、公私营商店、学校、文化宫、农村和东北区物资交流展览大会，并受到各地人民政府有关部门及各人民团体热烈的欢迎和招待。
    北京市归国华侨联谊会曾在两个观光团团员离开北京前举行大会欢送他们。会中，首都各学校华侨学生代表以许多事实，生动地报告了人民政府和各校师长同学爱护和照顾华侨学生的情形，并要求观光团团员们把他们现在所过的幸福生活转告他们在南洋的父母兄弟姐妹。他们的动人的叙述使好多个观光团团员感动得流泪。
    缅甸华侨归国观光团团长杨老清在谈到他回国观光后的印象时说：在新中国社会中，人与人之间的互相关切和亲密互助，给他印象最深。尤其是在踏上祖国土地之后，各阶层人民对华侨观光团所表示的欢迎热情，使他永远不能忘记。缅甸华侨归国观光团副团长饶伯勋说：“我们在参观了东北之后，已更进一步地认识到，祖国的确强大起来了。”
    印尼华侨归国观光团团长宋中铨说：“我个人印象最深的，是浓厚的学习风气、优良的新社会道德和高涨的爱国主义精神。”他并说，回国观光的印尼华侨有一个共同的印象，那就是：祖国前途灿烂光明，祖国伟大可爱。印尼华侨归国观光团副团长陈荣智说，他对于新中国的各级政府真正是属于人民的这一点，印象最深。
    两个观光团的团员都表示在这次回国观光后，得到极深刻的印象，感到做一个中华人民共和国人民无比光荣。
