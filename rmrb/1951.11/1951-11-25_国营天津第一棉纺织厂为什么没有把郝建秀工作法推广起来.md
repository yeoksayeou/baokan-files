The inspection group for the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, jointly organized by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China and the North China Textile Administration Bureau, conducted a preliminary inspection of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory from the end of October to the beginning of November and found that the factory's promotion work was in a state of chaos.

The factory began to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method on October 3rd. Prior to this, four workers from the factory had participated in the Qingdao fine yarn conference, and more than 60 employees had studied at the Hao Jianxiu Work Method School of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 and No. 4 Cotton Textile Factories. The factory's administrative staff organized some of these returning "little teachers" into two promotion teams, led by technicians, to carry out the promotion work, but the factory's leading cadres did not participate in the promotion work. The guiding principle of the promotion work was "promote first, then educate," so no preparations were made in terms of ideology, materials, or technology before the promotion. Cadres and the masses had a vague understanding of the promotion work, and even developed a resistant attitude. At the beginning of the promotion, the composition of the blended cotton was changed, and the temperature and humidity were difficult to control, resulting in more yarn breaks. The amount of roller waste generally increased from 0.45 pounds to 0.55 pounds. The "little teachers" were not fully prepared before going to the machines, so their demonstrations were quite clumsy. Some workers originally had conservative ideas, and when they saw this situation, their blind resistance to the new work method became even more serious. In the first three weeks, only one group was promoted, and even that was not thorough. At the beginning of the second phase of the promotion work, the masses' confused thinking was still not resolved. The skepticism of the workshop technical cadres towards the Hao Jianxiu Work Method became even more obvious. Some administrative cadres believed that "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is good, but it cannot reduce roller waste!" "Even if it can be reduced, it won't work in Factory No. 1, the roller waste rate in Factory No. 1 has already been reduced to the lowest point." Some technicians supported the opinions of backward workers who were unwilling to learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method at the meeting, distorted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and excessively emphasized the advantages of the factory's original work method. This situation was most serious in the No. 2 Spinning Workshop. Leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League did not seize the opportunity to solve these problems. This made many employees lose confidence in reducing roller waste, and the new work method was implemented in a chaotic manner, resulting in more yarn breaks and roller waste. The yarn breakage rate of 21-count yarn in the No. 2 Spinning Workshop increased from 9.35% to 11%, and the average roller waste of the entire workshop increased from 0.55 pounds to 0.62 pounds. Except for workers who learned well and maintained their original level of roller waste, the roller waste of ordinary workers gradually increased. By the end of October, the factory had begun to strengthen the leadership of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method ideologically and organizationally, and the morale of the masses had improved somewhat. The roller waste rate also gradually decreased. However, the promotion work had not really started.

Many cadres and technicians in the factory mistakenly believed that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method could not be promoted in the factory. When the promotion work encountered obstacles, they shouted even louder: "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is going to collapse in Factory No. 1." However, even under their ineffective promotion, many facts proved that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method could be promoted in the factory. A few workers who studied diligently achieved good results. Kang Dezhen, a fine yarn worker in the No. 1 Spinning Workshop, with the help of the "little teachers," earnestly studied and delved into the subject, mastered the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, improved her ability to look after the machines, and reduced the amount of roller waste. In the past, she looked after 700 spindles of 22-count yarn on large cops, with a roller waste rate of 0.306%; now she looks after 800 spindles of 22-count yarn on small cops, and the roller waste rate has been reduced to 0.173%. After Gao Sulan learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, she did more cleaning work, reduced yarn breaks, and reduced walking time by 30% compared to the past. After the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was promoted in one group in the No. 1 Spinning Workshop, the average number of defective yarns per machine dropped from 1.2 to 0.57. However, the factory's administrative cadres and technicians ignored these facts.

Why did the above-mentioned serious shortcomings occur in the factory's promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method?

First of all, the factory's leadership was ideologically confused. The factory's leading cadres usually did not pay attention to workers' innovations and lacked sensitivity to new things, so they did not fully understand the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. They always doubted whether the Hao Jianxiu Work Method could reduce roller waste. Before promoting the advanced work method, Factory Director Ge said: "Qingdao has a Hao Jianxiu, and our Factory No. 1 has a Meng Shuyuan!" Kong Fanfen, director of the fine yarn workshop in the No. 2 Spinning Workshop, also said: "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is going to collapse in Factory No. 1!" In general, cadres had a blind sense of contempt and resistance to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Under the control of this complacent mood, the factory's leading cadres completely lost their due leadership role in this movement. They adopted a tolerant attitude towards the erroneous ideas of a few backward workers; they even adopted a mocking attitude towards the "little teachers" who were doing the promotion work. When the "little teachers" said that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was good, the administrative cadres would ask, "You say it's good, where is it good? Why can't the roller waste be reduced?" When the "little teachers" did not answer completely, the administrative cadres would walk away with a sneer. The administrative leading cadres even held a symposium for the "little teachers," insisting that they say that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was not good. When the "little teachers" said that they could not say that, Yan Luyin, director of the fine yarn workshop, said in a sarcastic tone: "I don't think the 'little teachers' have no opinions on the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Is it because they ate well, drank well, took the train, and went swimming in the sea in Qingdao, without spending a penny, and are a little embarrassed to mention it?" The bureaucratic style of the leading cadres fueled the errors of some technicians. These technicians were unwilling to criticize the fear of difficulty among the masses and the unwillingness to learn the ideas of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and they separated a complete work method. They blindly emphasized the advantages of implementing the factory's work method, and even said that the achievements of Kang Dezhen, a worker in the factory, in learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, was "Kang Dezhen, a worker in the factory, created a new direction for the work method." As a result, the masses' attention to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was affected.

The factory did not implement the mass line in the promotion work. The factory's administrative leading cadres always believed that the trade union's strength was too weak, so they did not mobilize and educate the masses through the trade union. The trade union leading cadres also adopted an indifferent attitude. The administrative staff transferred workers to study and decided on the focus of the promotion work, but the trade union did not know about it in advance. When the administrative staff held mass meetings, the chairman of the trade union only attended as a non-voting delegate. In the promotion work, the promotion team carried out its work in isolation, without combining it with other central tasks, and without close connection with the work of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, so that after a month of promotion, the party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and key members had not yet been fully ideologically mobilized. Thus, the promotion work fell into a state of isolation and helplessness.

At present, although the factory's leading cadres have initially recognized some of the errors that occurred in the process of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, some cadres' thinking is still confused. They emphasize simply learning the work methods of workers such as Kang Dezhen in the factory, and are conducting technical measurements with a skeptical attitude. The "little teachers" are generally afraid of being attacked again. In order to make the promotion work a mass movement, the factory should seize the opportunity to solve the following problems:

First, correct the thinking of cadres and strengthen ideological leadership. Leading comrades should personally take action to organize the vast number of cadres (especially workshop technical cadres) to criticize past shortcomings, correct everyone's thinking (and make public self-criticisms to the masses when necessary); and through patriotic education, conduct extensive and in-depth publicity among the masses in a timely manner, boost the confidence of the masses, and create a wave of enthusiasm for the promotion work to ensure the development of the shock production increase movement. Second, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League should unify their pace and carry out the promotion in a planned and leadership manner. A stronger cadre should also be appointed to specifically lead the promotion work. Third, it is necessary to rely on the masses to carry out the promotion work. Attention should be paid to cultivating the technical abilities of the "little teachers," discovering and cultivating activists among the masses, and establishing banners for promotion and learning. This requires relying on the trade union to closely integrate the promotion work with the work of the trade union group, making it the central content of the current mass movement. Fourth, it is necessary to combine the situation of the factory, mobilize the masses to use the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and timely absorb the advanced experience created by the masses to enrich the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, so as to continuously improve technology and improve production.

    国营天津第一棉纺织厂为什么没有把郝建秀工作法推广起来
    天津市推广郝建秀工作法检查组
    中国纺织工会天津市委员会与华北纺织管理局，联合组织的推广郝建秀工作法检查组，于十月底至十一月初，初步检查了国营天津第一棉纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法的情况，发现该厂的推广工作，陷于混乱状态。
    十月三日该厂开始推广郝建秀工作法，在这以前，该厂有四个工人参加过青岛细纱会议，又有六十多个职工在国营天津第二、第四棉纺织厂郝建秀工作法学校学习过。该厂行政方面把这些学习回来的小先生中的一部分，编为两个推广队，由技术员领导，进行推广工作，但该厂领导干部，没有参加推广工作。推广工作的方针是“先推广，后教育”，因此，在推广之前，在思想上、物质上、技术上都未做任何准备。干部、群众对推广工作的认识都很模糊，甚至产生了对抗情绪。开始推广时，恰值配花成份改变，温湿度很难掌握，断头增多，皮辊花一般的由○·四五磅增加到○·五五磅。小先生上车前，未做充分准备，因此表演相当生疏。一部分工人原有保守思想，他们看到这种情况，对新工作法的盲目抵抗情绪，更加严重了。在开始的三周内，仅推广了一个组，而且不够彻底。在推广工作第二阶段开始时，群众的糊涂思想仍未解决。车间技术干部对郝建秀工作法的怀疑，暴露得更为明显。有些行政干部认为“郝建秀工作法好是好，就是不能减少皮辊花！”“即使能减少，在一厂也不行，一厂皮辊花率已经降到最低点了。”有些技术人员，在会议上支持落后工人不愿学习郝建秀工作法的意见，歪曲郝建秀工作法，过分强调本厂原有工作法的优点，这种情况，以第二纺场为最严重。党、行政、工会、和青年团的领导干部都未抓紧解决这些问题。这样就使得许多职工对减少皮辊花丧失信心，新工作法执行得很混乱，断头和皮辊花更增多了。第二纺场二十一支纱断头率由百分之九·三五增至百分之一一，全车间的皮辊花平均由○·五五磅增至○·六二磅，除了学习较好的工人，保持了原有皮辊花的水平外，一般工人的皮辊花都逐渐增加。至十月底，该厂已开始从思想上和组织上加强了关于郝建秀工作法推广工作的领导，群众的情绪已经有所提高。皮辊花率也逐渐降低。但是，推广工作并未真正开展起来。
    该厂不少干部和技术人员，错误地认为郝建秀工作法不能在该厂推广，当推广工作遇到阻碍时，他们更大嚷大叫：“郝建秀工作法在一厂要垮台。”但是，就在他们推行不力的情况下，仍有许多事实证明，郝建秀工作法在该厂是可以推广的。少数认真学习的工人，都获得了很好的成绩。第一纺场细纱工人康德珍，在小先生的帮助下，认真学习钻研，掌握了郝建秀工作法的基本精神，提高了看台能力，减少了皮辊花的数量。过去她看二十二支纱大管七○○锭，皮辊花率为百分之○·三○六；现在看二十二支纱小管八○○锭，皮辊花率降低为百分之○·一七三。高素兰学会郝建秀工作法后，多作了清洁工作，减少了断头，走路时间比过去减少百分之三○。第一纺场一组推广了郝建秀工作法后，坏纱平均每台由一·二降至○·五七个。但是，该厂的行政干部和技术人员却无视这些事实。
    为什么该厂推广郝建秀工作法中会发生上述严重缺点呢？
    首先是该厂领导思想混乱，该厂领导干部平时不重视工人创造，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，因而对郝建秀工作法的意义认识不足。他们始终怀疑郝建秀工作法是否能减少皮辊花，未推广先进工作法前，该厂葛厂长就说：“青岛有个郝建秀，我们一厂有个孟淑媛！”第二纺场细纱主任孔繁芬也说：“郝建秀工作法在一厂要垮台！”一般干部对郝建秀工作法都存在着盲目的轻视和抵抗情绪，在这种骄傲自满情绪支配下，该厂领导干部在这一运动中，完全丧失了应有的领导作用。他们对于少数落后工人的错误思想，采取了纵容的态度；对于做推广工作的小先生，甚至采取了奚落的态度。小先生说郝建秀工作方法好，行政干部就追问说“你说好，好在那里？皮辊花为什么不能降低？”小先生答的不完全，行政干部就冷笑着走了。行政领导干部甚至召开过小先生座谈会，硬要小先生说郝建秀工作法不好，小先生表示不能这样说，细纱主任阎禄寅竟用讽刺的口吻说：“我看小先生对郝建秀工作法不是没有意见，是不是在青岛吃的好，喝的好，坐了火车，洗了海澡，一个钱也不花，有些不好意思提？”领导干部的官僚主义作风，助长了某些技术人员的错误，这些技术人员不肯批判群众中的怕困难，不愿学习郝建秀工作法的思想，而把一套完整的工作法分开。他们一味强调实行本厂工作法的好处，甚至把康德珍学习郝建秀工作法取得的成绩，说成是“本厂工人康德珍创造了工作法的新方向”。结果，影响了群众对郝建秀工作法的重视。
    该厂在推广工作中，没有贯彻群众路线。该厂行政领导干部始终认为工会力量太弱，因此，就没有通过工会去发动教育群众。工会领导干部也采取了漠不关心的态度。行政方面抽调工人学习，决定推广工作的重点，工会事先都不知道。行政方面召开群众会议时，工会主席只是列席参加。在推广工作中，推广大队孤立地进行工作，不和其他中心工作相结合，不与党、工会和青年团的工作密切连系，以致推广了一个月，在党员青年团员和骨干分子中，还未做充分的思想动员。至此，推广工作遂陷于孤立无援的状态。
    目前，该厂的领导干部虽然初步认识了推广郝建秀工作法过程中发生的一些错误，但部分干部思想仍然混乱。他们强调单纯学习本厂工人康德珍等的工作法，并且抱着怀疑态度进行技术测定。小先生普遍害怕再受打击。为了把推广工作造成群众运动，该厂应抓紧解决以下问题：
    第一，端正干部思想，加强思想领导。领导同志应亲自动手，组织广大干部（特别是车间技术干部）批判过去的缺点，端正大家的思想（必要时应公开向群众作检讨）；并通过爱国主义教育，及时在群众中进行广泛深入的宣传，鼓舞群众的信心，把推广工作造成热潮，以保证突击增产运动的开展。第二，党、行政、工会和青年团应统一步调，有计划有领导地进行推广。并应指派较强的干部具体领导推广工作。第三，必须依靠群众进行推广工作，应该注意培养小先生的技术能力，发现和培养群众中的积极分子，树立推广和学习的旗帜。这就必须依靠工会，使推广工作和工会小组工作紧密结合，成为当前群众运动的中心内容。第四，必须结合本厂情况，发动群众运用郝建秀工作法的基本精神，及时吸取群众创造的先进经验，充实郝建秀工作法，从而不断的提高技术，改进生产。
