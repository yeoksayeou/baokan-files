The mission is led by Peng Zemin, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government, and Wu Xinyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, serving as the head and deputy head of the mission, respectively.

　　Before departure, Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, convened a meeting with cadres above the level of sub-mission head. Vice Premier Dong pointed out that after the comfort mission arrives in the disaster areas, it should effectively convey to the people the deep concern of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for them, publicize the policies of the Central People's Government, and encourage the people in the disaster areas to have confidence in overcoming the disaster. It should also conduct in-depth investigations into the disaster situation and the specific difficulties of the people in the disaster areas, and assist the local people's governments in mobilizing the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster through methods such as production for self-relief and social mutual assistance, with the strong support of the people's government. The comfort mission should also assist the disaster areas in combining disaster relief work with disaster prevention work to prepare for next year's production.
