Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 3rd Dispatch: The Second Session of the World Peace Council held its second meeting on the morning of November 2nd, presided over by Mrs. Gordon. The first speaker was Mr. Pritt, member of the World Peace Council and representative of the United Kingdom. He emphasized that the British people urgently hoped for an early end to the Korean War. The British people also hoped that the Egyptian question could be resolved peacefully. Mr. Pritt said: This sentiment of the British people has helped the work of the British Peace Committee to achieve success. The British Peace Committee has achieved significant successes in trade unions, industrial enterprises, and among the broad masses of the people. Mr. Pritt, on behalf of the British delegation, suggested that the World Peace Council send a delegation to Paris to explain the views of the World Peace Council to the United Nations General Assembly and request the United Nations to take action for the sake of peace. Mr. Pritt assured that despite all the difficulties, British peace fighters are prepared to continue their work for the benefit of all mankind until victory.

The famous French peace fighter, Mr. Boullier, in his speech, emphasized the great importance of concluding a peace pact among the five great powers. He said: If the United Nations truly wants to fulfill its responsibilities, it must act according to the path prescribed for it by the people of the world when it was founded. The first step in this direction is for the five great powers – the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China – to hold negotiations to study and resolve all differences peacefully. Restoring the principle of great power unity in the United Nations, thereby ensuring the normal activities of the United Nations, must be an important part of the five-power peace pact.

The next speaker, the Polish representative, Mr. Tymowski, said: The main thing that all progressive humanity cares about is preventing war. We must influence the Korean negotiations. The US aggression against Korea must end. The proposal to conclude a peace pact has won the support of the broad masses of the people around the world: millions upon millions of ordinary people have shown that they are ready to fight for peace. The fruits of human labor must never be spent on war but must be used for a peaceful and happy life. Peace fighters must strive to hold a round-table conference of the five great powers to sign a peace pact. Mr. Tymowski concluded by saying that the Polish people wholeheartedly support the peace movement and unanimously demand the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers.

Dr. Edward, a prominent representative of the Indian peace movement, described the achievements of the All-India Peace Conference held in Bombay this May, which unanimously adopted all the resolutions of the First Session of the World Peace Council. The Indian people firmly support peace. Edward said: The Indian people are beginning to become increasingly concerned about the international situation and are closely watching the developments in other countries, especially the situation in Korea. He went on to say: The United Nations' position on the Korean issue has shattered the Indian people's confidence in the objectivity of this organization.

Mrs. Streit (Australia), a member of the World Peace Council, exposed the deceptive claim that the troops currently fighting in Korea are United Nations forces. She said: The troops now fighting in Korea under the banner of the United Nations are not mobilized in accordance with the United Nations Charter but in accordance with the terms of the Atlantic Pact. Mrs. Streit went on to say: The construction of the Atlantic Group army is a direct violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations. The Americans are sending troops to more and more countries. They are interfering in those countries' commercial, financial, and economic affairs, establishing military bases on their territories, and confiscating homes and land belonging to the people. Mrs. Streit concluded by saying: The peace movement should expose the true plans of the Atlantic Group to the people, including the lie that the group's army is also the army of the United Nations. The people participating in the peace movement must be vigilant and defend the United Nations Charter. They must protect the United Nations organization and do their best to restore the organization's prestige and independence.

Reverend McGeagh, Secretary of the British Non-Violent Resistance Association, who participated in the meeting as a guest and attendee, spoke near the end of the morning session. He explained the views of British Christian non-violent resisters on the issues of war and peace and elaborated on the tasks of Christians around the world when humanity is threatened by a new war.

After he finished speaking, the morning session of November 2nd adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 3rd Dispatch: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd, chaired by Guo Moruo, a famous Chinese writer and scientist. The first speaker at the meeting was Mr. Agas, a representative of the Spanish people who are waging a heroic struggle against the Franco fascist regime. Agas said: The treaty between the US government and the Franco government stipulates that the entire territory of Spain and its bases in Africa will be placed at the disposal of the US General Staff to realize the heinous plans of the warmongers. Franco's conclusion of this treaty is tantamount to selling the Spanish people to the murderous army led by US officers to serve as cannon fodder. Franco has promised to provide twenty-two divisions. According to the US-Spanish treaty, the number of Spanish troops will be increased to two million when necessary. Agas then pointed out that the Spanish people are actively fighting for peace. 350,000 Spaniards have already signed the Peace Pact declaration. The Spanish working people unanimously demand that the Americans be driven out of Spanish territory.

British representative Crowther spoke next, talking about his recent impressions of visiting Australia and New Zealand. Crowther pointed out that the Australian people stopped their government's attempt to ban the Communist Party, giving the warmongers a major blow.

Mr. Toledano (Mexico), Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation and Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, said: The United States is constantly losing prestige among the people of Latin America. This is because the US imperialists are implementing an aggressive policy against the people of Latin America, intending to force them to participate in preparations for a new war. The US government wants to deprive the people of Latin America of their economic and political independence. Under the orders of the US government, the currencies of Latin American countries have been devalued. They export strategic raw materials to the United States at low prices and import American industrial products at high prices, allowing US monopoly capitalists to obtain super-profits.

Toledano went on to say: Due to the US aggressive policy, the civilian industries of Latin American countries are declining day by day. The living standards of the working people are constantly declining, and basic freedoms are being abolished. Special tribunals have been established to punish those who do not support the US aggressive policy and have democratic ideas. Toledano emphasized that the working people are strengthening their struggle against the US reactionary policy and against the Latin American governments that obediently follow Washington's instructions. The ordinary people of Latin American countries will do everything in their power to maintain and consolidate world peace.

The next speaker was Professor Brandweiner of the University of Graz, Austria, who discussed the issue of the Austrian peace treaty. He said: A peace treaty must be concluded to end the occupation of Austria and give Austria the peace it desires. But such a treaty can only be concluded if universal peace is maintained. Therefore, all peace-loving Austrian people are doing their best to maintain and consolidate peace. Brandweiner then spoke about the remilitarization of western Austria by the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance countries and pointed out that this would endanger Austria's independent survival and territorial integrity.

The participants then listened to a speech by Mr. Lombardi, a member of the Italian Socialist Party. He exposed the adverse effects of the arms expansion policy pursued by capitalist countries, which is an obstacle to the establishment of normal economic relations between countries, especially between Europe and other regions of the world. He particularly emphasized the need to help colonial countries and demanded that they be granted independence, as this is the most important condition for the economic development of colonial countries. He also pointed out that trade between capitalist countries and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries must be further expanded.

The famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg spoke to enthusiastic applause and said that an international agreement banning atomic weapons must be concluded. Without this agreement, the peaceful life of mankind is unimaginable. He said: We – the Soviet representatives attending the World Peace Council – support the demand to ban atomic weapons not because we are weak or afraid of American bombs, but because we want to protect all cities – Soviet, Chinese, and American – from destruction. We propose that the five great powers immediately begin discussing the issue of concluding a peace pact, first of all the issue of disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons.

    世界和平理事会第二日会议
    苏代表建议五大国缔结和平公约
    许多国家代表指出美国侵朝战争必须结束
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会第二届会议在二日上午举行会议，由戈登夫人主持。首先发言的是世界和平理事会理事、英国代表普里特。他强调英国人民迫切希望朝鲜战事尽早停止。英国人民也希望埃及问题能以和平方式获得解决。普里特说：英国人民的这种情绪，帮助了英国和平委员会的工作获得成就。英国和平委员会已经在工会、工业企业和广大人民中获得了重大的成就。普里特代表英国代表团建议世界和平理事会派遣代表团去巴黎，向联合国大会说明世界和平理事会的看法，并要求联合国为和平的利益而采取行动。普里特保证：尽管有一切困难，英国的和平战士准备把他们的为着全人类的利益的工作一直进行下去，直到胜利。
    法国著名的和平战士布利埃在发言中着重指出了缔结五大国和平公约的巨大重要性。他说：如果联合国真正想执行它的职责，它就必须按照全世界人民在联合国成立时为它规定的路线行事。沿着这个方向前进的第一步，就是由五大国——美国、法国、苏联、英国和中华人民共和国——举行谈判，以和平方式研究并解决一切分歧。恢复联合国中的大国一致的原则从而保障联合国的正常活动，必须是五大国和平公约的重要内容。
    接着发言的波兰代表第姆鲍夫斯基说：全体进步人类所关怀的主要的事情，是防止战争。我们必须影响朝鲜谈判。美国对朝鲜的侵略必须结束。缔结和平公约的主张已经获得了世界广大人民的拥护：千千万万的普通人民已经表明他们准备为和平而斗争。人类劳动的果实决不许耗费在战争上，而必须用在和平的幸福的生活上。和平战士必须为使五大国举行圆桌会议签订和平公约而努力。第姆鲍夫斯基最后说：波兰人民全心全意地支持和平运动，并一致要求缔结五大国和平公约。
    印度和平运动中著名的代表爱德华博士描述了今年五月在孟买举行的全印和平大会的成就，这次大会一致通过了世界和平理事会第一届会议的全部决议。印度人民坚决地拥护和平。爱德华说：印度人民正在开始日渐关心国际形势，并且正在密切地注视着其他国家的事态，特别是朝鲜的事态。他接着说：联合国对朝鲜问题的立场已经粉碎了印度人民对于这个组织的客观性的信心。
    世界和平理事会理事斯崔特夫人（澳大利亚）揭露了所谓现在在朝鲜作战的是联合国军队的骗人说法。她说：现在在朝鲜打着联合国旗帜作战的军队不是按照联合国宪章，而是按照大西洋公约的条款而动员的。斯崔特夫人接着说：编建大西洋集团军队是直接违反联合国基本原则的。美国人正在派遣军队到愈来愈多的国家去。他们正在干涉那些国家的商业、财政和经济事务，正在它们的领土上建立军事基地，并且没收属于人民的房屋和土地。斯崔特夫人最后说：和平运动应当向人民揭露大西洋集团的真正计划，就中也要揭露下述谎话：这个集团的军队同时也就是联合国的军队。参加和平运动的人民必须警觉并保卫联合国宪章。他们必须保护联合国组织，并尽最大的努力来恢复这个组织的威信和独立。
    以来宾和列席身份参加会议的英国非战主义协会秘书长麦盖尔牧师，在上午会议快要结束时发了言。他解释了英国基督徒非战主义者对战争与和平问题的看法，并详尽地论述了全世界基督徒在人类正遭到新战争威胁时的任务。
    他讲话完毕后，十一月二日上午的会议即行休会。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：塔斯社维也纳三日讯：世界和平理事会在二日下午继续举行会议，由中国著名作家和科学家郭沫若任主席。会上首先发言的是正在对佛朗哥法西斯政权进行英雄斗争的西班牙人民的代表阿加斯。阿加斯说：美国政府和佛朗哥政府之间的条约，规定把西班牙的全部领土及其在非洲的基地交由美国参谋总部支配，以便实现战争贩子的罪恶计划。佛朗哥缔订这项条约，实际上就等于把西班牙人民卖给美国军官率领的杀人军队充当炮灰。佛朗哥已经答应提供二十二个师。按照美西条约，在必要时西班牙军队的人数将增加到二百万人。阿加斯接着指出：西班牙人民正在为和平而积极斗争。已经有三十五万西班牙人在和平公约宣言上签名。西班牙劳动人民一致要求把美国人逐出西班牙领土。
    英国代表克劳瑟继起发言，他谈到最近访问澳大利亚和新西兰的印象。克劳瑟指出：澳大利亚人民制止了他们政府禁止共产党的企图，而给了战争贩子以重大的打击。
    拉丁美洲劳工联合会主席、世界工会联合会副主席托列达诺（墨西哥）发言说：美国在拉丁美洲人民中间的威信正在不断丧失。这是因为美帝国主义者对拉丁美洲人民实行侵略政策，打算迫使拉丁美洲人民参加新战争的准备。美国政府想要剥夺拉丁美洲人民的经济和政治独立。在美国政府的命令下，拉丁美洲各国的货币贬值了，它们以低价向美国输出战略原料，而以很高的价钱输入美国的工业品，使美国垄断资本家获得了超额利润。
    托列达诺接着说：由于美国的侵略政策，拉丁美洲各国的民用工业一天天衰落。劳动人民的生活水准不断下降，基本自由被取消了。特别法庭成立了起来，以惩罚那些不支持美国侵略政策并具有民主思想的人。托列达诺强调说：但是，劳动人民正加强斗争，反对美国的反动政策，反对驯服地遵从华盛顿指示的拉丁美洲各国政府。拉丁美洲各国的普通人民将竭尽全力来保持和巩固世界和平。
    接着发言的是奥地利格拉兹大学教授布兰德魏纳，他论述了对奥和约的问题。他说：必须缔订和约以结束对奥地利的占领，并给奥地利以它所渴望的和平。但是只有保持了普遍的和平，这种和约才有缔结的可能。因此，全体爱好和平的奥地利人民都尽力来保持和巩固和平。布兰德魏纳继而谈到侵略的北大西洋联盟国家使西奥地利重行军事化的情形，并指出：这将危害奥地利的独立生存和领土完整。
    与会者接着倾听了意大利社会党议员龙巴迪的发言。他揭露了资本主义国家所奉行的扩张军备政策的恶劣影响，这种政策是建立各国之间的正常经济关系，特别是欧洲和世界其他地区国家之间的正常经济关系的障碍。他特别强调必须帮助殖民地国家，并要求给予它们独立，因为这是殖民地国家的经济发展的最重要的条件。他并指出必须进一步扩大资本主义国家和苏联与人民民主国家之间的贸易。
    苏联著名作家爱伦堡在全场热烈的掌声中发言说：禁止原子武器的国际协定必须缔结。没有这个协定，人类的和平生活是无法想像的。他说：我们——出席世界和平理事会的苏联代表所以支持禁止原子武器的要求，不是因为我们软弱或害怕美国的炸弹，而是因为我们想要保护一切城市——苏联的、中国的、美国的都在内——不受破坏。我们建议要求五大国立即开始讨论缔结和平公约问题，首先是裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题。
