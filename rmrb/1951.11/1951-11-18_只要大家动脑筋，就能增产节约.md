Increased Production and Thrift Can Be Achieved If Everyone Uses Their Brains
	Tang Dexin Group, Tianjin First-Class Industrial Model Group
	We are a production group in the stem arranging section of the Zhonghua Match Factory. Our main job is to arrange the match stems, which have been sorted into boxes by the upper workshop (stem sorting section), into boards and hand them over to the lower workshop (dipping section) for dipping the match heads.

	In the past, everyone only cared about high output, and there was a phenomenon of wasting raw materials. During the patriotic pact competition from June to August this year, our group made reducing waste and lowering costs the main content of our patriotic pact. The biggest waste in the stem arranging section was the loss of raw materials. The group produced about thirty-five catties of defective match stems a day, and the entire section had more than two thousand catties per month. This was because the stems often fell on the ground during stem arranging, accumulating more and more. They were crushed under shoes and run over by carts. Good stems were crushed and broken, causing losses to the country. After discussion, everyone came up with a method of frequent sweeping to reduce waste. We established a system of sweeping the floor after arranging a cart of stems, and we also divided into groups to weigh and tally the results, competing with each other. As a result, the amount of defective stems was greatly reduced, from more than two thousand catties per month to more than two hundred and twenty catties, saving raw materials worth more than five million six hundred thousand yuan each month.

	This achievement in conservation aroused the attention of the entire department and boosted everyone's confidence in increasing production and practicing thrift. Everyone enthusiastically offered suggestions and thought of various ways to save raw materials. For example, in the past, machine oil was poured by an auxiliary worker, but because he did not understand the specific conditions of the machines, he was not sure how much to pour, and sometimes he did not pour it in time, wasting oil and wearing out the machine's bearings. Now, it is changed to the stem arranging workers pouring the oil themselves, which eliminates these shortcomings, reduces machine wear and tear, and also reduces the monthly oil consumption from eighty-five catties to forty-three and a half catties, saving more than one million one hundred thousand yuan. For example, in the past, machines were not inspected and maintained on time, and maintenance was insufficient, resulting in frequent downtime, which not only delayed production but also cost seven hundred and fifty repair man-hours per month. Now, a responsibility system has been established, with regular inspections. The comrades who repair the machines have also organized technical studies to improve their skills. With the machines working better, the monthly repair man-hours have also been reduced to only four hundred and fifty-six, saving more than five hundred and sixty thousand yuan. In addition, kerosene consumption has dropped from thirty-five catties to eight catties; waste cotton yarn has dropped from thirty catties to ten catties; and machine parts worth about two million five hundred thousand yuan have been saved. On these few major consumption items alone, we save the country about ten million thirty thousand yuan per month, which is equivalent to more than half of the total wages of the department. Moreover, through conservation, we have also established many systems. Based on the achievements after conservation, the group made a quota for the group, further improving the group's economic accounting.

	At the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao called on us to carry out increased production and thrift to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. From our past practical work, we deeply experienced the importance of this work. As long as we use our brains to think of ways, we can not only save money but also improve factory management and establish and improve various systems through conservation. We warmly respond to Chairman Mao's call. After discussion, our group has formulated a specific work program for the future. We plan to further reduce the original group's cost and consumption quotas in November: raw material losses will be reduced by 15% according to the original quota, material quotas will be reduced by 25%, repair man-hours will be reduced by 20%, and output and quality will be improved by 5%. We will also better unite with the comrades in various departments of the factory, learn from each other, and jointly respond to Chairman Mao's call to create more wealth for the country.

    只要大家动脑筋，就能增产节约
        天津市一等工业模范小组唐德鑫小组
    我们是中华火柴厂排梗工段中的一个生产小组。我们的主要工作是将上车间（理梗工段）理成了盒的火柴梗子排成板，交给下车间（沾药部）蘸药头。
    过去，因为大家只顾产量多，有浪费原料材料的现象。在今年六月到八月的爱国公约竞赛运动中，我们小组把减少浪费、降低成本订为爱国公约的主要内容。排梗工段浪费最大的是原料损耗，小组里一天要出三十五斤左右残废火柴梗子，全工段每月有两千多斤。这是因为排梗时梗子经常掉在地上，愈积愈多，鞋底踩、车子轧，好梗子踩毁了，轧断了，就给国家造成了损失。经过大家讨论，想出了勤扫地以减少浪费的办法。我们建立了排一车梗子，扫一次地的制度，并且分组分人过磅统计，互相比赛。这一来，残梗子大大减少了，由每月两千多斤降低到二百二十多斤，每个月节省的原料值五百六十多万元。
    这一节约成绩引起了全部门的重视，鼓起了大家增产节约的信心。大家热烈地出主意，想各种各样的办法来节省原物料。比如：从前浇机器油的是一个辅助工，因为他不了解机器的具体情况，浇多浇少没个准，有时还浇得不及时，浪费了油还磨坏机器的轴瓦。这会，改为由排梗工人自己浇油，就消灭了这些缺点，减少了机器的损耗，每月油的消耗也由八十五斤减少到四十三斤半，节约了一百一十多万元。又如，过去机器不按时检修，保养不够，经常发生停机现象，不只耽误生产，每月还要花七百五十个修理工时。这会建立了负责制，定期检修，修理机器的同志还组织了技术学习，提高了技术。机器好使了，每月修理工也减少到只要四百五十六个工时，节约了五十六万余元。另外，煤油消耗从三十五斤降到八斤；废棉纱从三十斤降到十斤；机器零件节约约值二百五十多万元。只在这几项主要消耗上，每月就给国家节约了一千零三十万元左右，相当于本部门工资总额的一半以上。而且，通过节约，还建立了许多制度。小组根据节约后的成绩，作了小组的定额，进一步提高了小组的经济核算。
    在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，毛主席号召我们要开展增产节约来加强抗美援朝运动。我们从过去的实际工作中深切地体验到这一工作的重要性。只要我们开动脑筋想办法，不但能够节约，而且能从节约中改进工厂管理，建立和健全各种制度。我们热烈响应毛主席的号召。我们小组经过讨论后，大家订出了今后的具体工作纲领。我们准备在十一月份再降低原有的小组成本各项消耗定额：原料损耗按原定额降低百分之十五，物料定额降低百分之二十五，修理人工减少百分之二十，产量质量提高百分之五。我们还要更好地和全厂各个部门的同志团结一道，互相学习，共同响应毛主席的号召，为国家创造更多的财富。
