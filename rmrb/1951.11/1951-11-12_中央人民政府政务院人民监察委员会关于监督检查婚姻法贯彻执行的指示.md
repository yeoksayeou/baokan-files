Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, it has achieved significant results due to the support of the broad masses of people and the efforts of cadres at all levels. A large number of men and women have gained freedom of marriage, increased their enthusiasm for production and work, and actively participated in various production and political, economic, and cultural construction activities. However, on the other hand, due to the long-term feudal rule in the past, the remnants of the feudal system still exist in the minds of some of the masses and a small number of cadres, hindering the implementation of the Marriage Law. For example, some cadres adopt a hands-off attitude towards the struggle of men and women for freedom of marriage, failing to provide active assistance. Some cadres even directly interfere and sabotage, resulting in the continuous occurrence of women being forced to commit suicide or being killed, especially in rural areas. We must attach importance to this situation and deal with it seriously.

The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has already issued instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law. In the past year, although some People's Supervision Committees at all levels have conducted some key inspections on the implementation of the Marriage Law, in general, not enough attention has been paid to organizing planned supervision and inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law. They have failed to seriously inspect and correct illegal and derelict organs and personnel in the implementation of the Marriage Law, such as failing to support and assist correct marriages and divorces, or delaying their processing, or even events of interference, sabotage, or incorrect handling. Therefore, they have failed to use supervision and correction work to criticize and educate some staff members' residual feudal ideas, so as to improve their understanding of the Marriage Law, so that the Marriage Law can be more smoothly and deeply implemented.

Therefore, People's Supervision Committees at all levels must conscientiously study and discuss the instructions of the Government Administration Council on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, fully recognize the important significance of implementing the Marriage Law, promote governments at all levels to organize inspections of the implementation of the Marriage Law, and correct illegal and derelict organs and personnel. People's Supervision Committees at all levels should take this work as one of the regular work tasks, conduct key supervision and inspection in a planned way, closely contact and mobilize the masses through supervision correspondents to carry out supervision, and must correct and appropriately punish organs and personnel who violate laws and neglect their duties in the implementation of the Marriage Law. At the same time, organs and personnel who can conscientiously implement the Marriage Law correctly must be commended to educate and encourage cadres to promote this work. It is also necessary to conduct good publicity and education to strengthen and ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law.

It is hoped that the above will be studied and implemented immediately, and we hope that you will report the situation and experience to us at any time.

### 中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会关于监督检查婚姻法贯彻执行的指示

    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会关于监督检查婚姻法贯彻执行的指示
    中华人民共和国婚姻法公布以来，由于广大人民的拥护与各级干部的努力执行，已收到显著的成绩。大批的男女因获得了婚姻的自由，提高了生产和工作热情，积极地参加了各种生产和各种政治、经济、文化等建设活动；但另一方面也由于过去长期的封建统治，封建制度在一部分群众及少数干部思想中还存在着残余的影响，阻碍了婚姻法的贯彻执行。如有的干部对男女为婚姻自由的斗争，采取袖手旁观的态度，不予积极帮助，甚至有的干部进行直接的干涉与破坏，以致还有不少地区特别在农村中仍不断的发生妇女被逼自杀或被杀的现象。这种情况，我们必须加以重视，认真处理。
    中央人民政府政务院已经发布了关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示。一年来各级人民监察委员会虽有的对婚姻法的执行情况作过某些重点地检查；但一般对婚姻法的贯彻执行情况，有计划地组织监督检查注意的很不够。对执行婚姻法中，某些违法失职的机关和工作人员，例如对正确的结婚、离婚不予支持和帮助，或拖延不予处理，甚至对干涉破坏或作错误处理的事件，亦未认真的检查与纠举。因此，未能通过监督与纠举工作，对某些工作人员的残余的封建思想进行批判教育，以提高他们对婚姻法的认识，从而使婚姻法能更加顺利和深入的贯彻执行。
    因此各级人民监察委员会必须认真地学习和讨论政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示，充分地认识执行婚姻法的重要意义，推动各级政府组织对婚姻法执行情况的检查，并纠举其中违法失职的机关和工作人员。各级人民监察委员会应将此项工作做为经常的工作任务之一，有计划地进行重点的监督检查，通过监察通讯员密切联系和发动群众进行监督，对执行婚姻法的违法失职的机关和人员，必须予以纠举与适当惩处；同时对能认真贯彻正确的执行婚姻法的机关与人员，必须予以表扬，以教育与鼓励干部推动该项工作。并且要很好地进行宣传和教育，以加强和保证婚姻法的贯彻实施。
    向以上希即研究执行，并望将情况和经验，随时我们报告。
                            主任　谭平山
