　　Churchill Cabinet Facing Great Difficulties
　  U.S. Ruling Group Anxious and Uneasy
    【Xinhua News Agency, October 31st】The U.S. ruling group, which had vigorously supported the Conservative Party before the British election and actively provided support, is now greatly disappointed with the outcome of the British election. Whether Churchill's new Conservative cabinet can avoid being overwhelmed by the enormous difficulties at home and abroad has become a concern for the U.S. ruling group.
    Since Attlee announced the early election on September 19th, the U.S. ruling group has expressed great enthusiasm for the possibility of the Conservative Party coming to power. According to the Associated Press, Washington political figures immediately expressed "satisfaction" with the news that Britain had decided to hold an election, because "this election offers hope that a certain party in Britain will obtain a majority that can carry out its work smoothly." U.S. Representative Bartel hinted at support for Churchill, saying, "I hope the British people will clear the air in this election and strengthen whatever government they elect to power. The current government's majority is too weak." At the same time, American newspapers excitedly anticipated that the Conservative Party could establish a "strong government" to intensify the enslavement of the British people and implement America's war policy. The "New York Herald Tribune" said in an editorial on September 21st: The British election "should end the period of instability and unsatisfactoriness in British political life." A commentator for the "Washington Star" also stated: "Greater political stability within Britain will strengthen Western unity."
    However, now that the results of the British election have been revealed, the Conservative Party has only obtained a "slim majority." Regarding this fact, the Associated Press's New York dispatch on the 28th frankly admitted: "Wall Street originally expected the Conservative Party to win. However, Churchill's slim majority in the House of Commons greatly disappointed Wall Street."
    A dispatch from Washington by Agence France-Presse revealed that while the U.S. ruling group welcomed the Conservative Party's victory, it was also anxiously concerned about the question of "how the new government can cope with a series of problems at home and abroad with such a small majority." Currently, American newspapers are filled with a tone that is clearly not very enthusiastic. The "New York Herald Tribune" said: "The victorious Conservative Party has been granted sufficient power; however, they have not received the clear support of the people necessary to ensure the success and permanence of this power." "Britain and the world cannot expect Churchill to perform any miracles." The "New York Times" also published an editorial expressing regret that the Conservative Party had not won more seats.
    The most explicit statement came from the Scripps-Howard newspapers in an editorial published on the 26th, which stated: "The new government faces very serious problems. The trade deficit is rising, and the dollar shortage is very severe. The momentum of inflation is still fierce"; the British people have "no other way out" except to "produce more and save more."
    However, just as the Scripps-Howard newspaper editorial admitted, the policy of intensifying the exploitation of the British people to carry out arms expansion and war preparations has already caused the Labor government to "no longer gain the trust of the people." So, can Churchill shoulder the "leadership" that "Britain urgently needs"? Its answer is: "No one knows."

### 邱吉尔内阁困难极大  美统治集团忧虑不安

　　邱吉尔内阁困难极大
　  美统治集团忧虑不安
    【新华社三十一日讯】曾经在英国大选前竭力替保守党捧场，并积极予以支持的美国统治集团，现在对英国大选的结果大为失望。邱吉尔的保守党新内阁能否不被英国国内外的巨大困难所压倒，已成为美国统治集团所忧虑的一桩心事。
    自从艾德礼在九月十九日宣布提前举行大选以后，美国统治集团就对保守党之可能登台表示了极大的热望。据合众社透露，华盛顿政界人士对于英国决定举行大选的消息曾立即表示“满意”，原因是“这个选举有希望使英国的某一政党获得可以顺利进行工作的多数”。美国众议员巴特尔一面暗示支持邱吉尔，一面说：“我希望英国人民将在这次选举中廓清气氛，并加强他们选出来执政的任何政府。目前政府的多数太薄弱。”同时，美国报纸也兴高彩烈地期待保守党能建立一个“强有力的政府”，来加紧奴役英国人民而贯彻美国的战争政策。《纽约先驱论坛报》在九月二十一日的社论中曾说：英国大选“应该结束英国政治生活中的动荡不定和难惬人意的时期”。《华盛顿明星报》的评论家也表示：“英国国内的更大的政治稳定将加强西方的团结”。
    但是，现在英国大选的结果揭晓了，保守党所获得的只是一个“微弱的多数”，对于这一事实，美联社纽约二十八日电坦白地承认：华尔街原来期望保守党获胜，然而，邱吉尔在下院中只占极少多数一事，使得华尔街大为扫兴。”
    法新社从华盛顿发出的电讯透露：美国统治集团尽管对保守党的胜利表示欢迎，但是同时却忐忑不安地担心这样的问题，那就是：新政府“如何能够以极少的多数”来应付当前英国国内外的一系列的问题。现在，充斥在美国报纸上的是一种显然并无多大兴头的论调。《纽约先驱论坛报》就说：“获胜的保守党已被赋予充分的权力；然而他们却没有得到为保证这种权力的成功和持久所必须的人民的明确支持。”“英国和世界不能期望邱吉尔会干出什么奇迹来。”纽约时报也发表社论，对于保守党之未能获得更多议席表示遗憾。
    说得最明白的是美国的斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸在二十六日发表的社论，其中说：“新政府面临的问题是很严重的。贸易逆差正在上升，美元荒非常严重。通货膨胀的势头还很凶”；英国人民除了“更多地生产，更多地节省”，“再也没有其他的出路”。
    然而，正像斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸的社论所承认的，加紧压榨英国人民以进行扩军备战的政策，已经使工党政府“不再获得人民的信任”，那么，邱吉尔是否能够担当得起“英国迫切需要”的“领导”呢？它的回答是：“没有人知道”。
