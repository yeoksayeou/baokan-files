What is the Root Cause of the Deadlock in the Korean Armistice Negotiations?

The Korean armistice negotiations have resumed for more than half a month since October 25. However, due to the continued obstructionist and delaying tactics adopted by the United States in the negotiations, the negotiations have not made any progress.

The negotiations are still stuck on the second item on the agenda, namely, determining the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone. In order to reach an agreement on this agenda item quickly, so as to establish the basic conditions for an armistice, our side's representatives have made the greatest efforts. After the resumption of negotiations, our side's representatives attending the subcommittee proposed a military demarcation line plan based on the existing battle line and making comprehensive adjustments to the entire battlefield. Later, our side's representatives further proposed a plan to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone with an on-the-spot ceasefire as the content. These two plans, like the previous plan proposed by our side to use the 38th parallel as the armistice military demarcation line, are fair and reasonable and treat both sides completely equally. In fact, apart from these plans, it is absolutely impossible to find any other fair and reasonable plan that treats both sides equally. However, the U.S. representatives rejected all these two plans. In order to counter our side's reasonable plan and obstruct the agreement on the issue of the armistice military demarcation line and demilitarized zone, the U.S. representatives proposed and insisted on an unreasonable plan to unilaterally demand that our side withdraw 1,500 square kilometers from the existing contact line, vainly attempting to seize our side's Kaesong area; later, they even proposed the absurd proposition of not making specific provisions for the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone for the time being, which actually meant overturning the second agenda item that both sides had unanimously agreed upon as early as July 26.

Now it is very clear that the fundamental difference between our side and the U.S. side is: our side's attitude is to strive to reach a specific agreement on the issue of determining the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone as quickly as possible, so as to establish the basic conditions for an armistice, and then enter into the discussion of other agenda items, so that the entire armistice negotiations can reach an agreement as soon as possible. The U.S. side's attitude is to try its best to avoid reaching a specific agreement on this agenda item, so as to indefinitely delay the armistice negotiations. This difference between our side and the U.S. side can be clearly seen from the two proposals put forward by the representatives of both sides at the subcommittee meeting on the 10th of this month.

The plan proposed by our side's representatives on the 7th of this month and simplified on the 10th of this month is: "(1) To determine the principle of using the actual contact line between the two sides as the military demarcation line, and to withdraw two kilometers from this line to establish a demilitarized zone. (2) The subcommittee should immediately correct the existing actual contact line according to the above principle to determine the existing actual contact line agreed upon by both sides as the military demarcation line, and from this determine the north and south edges of the demilitarized zone as two kilometers on each side of the military demarcation line, and delineate the demilitarized zone. (3) After the entire armistice agreement is agreed upon, but before it is signed, the subcommittee must make corresponding modifications to the above-mentioned military demarcation line and demilitarized zone in accordance with the changes in the actual contact line between the two sides at that time."

The plan proposed by the U.S. representatives on the 5th of this month, slightly modified and re-proposed on the 10th of this month, and formalized on the 11th of this month, is: "(1) In order to determine the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone as a basic condition for stopping hostilities in Korea, the subcommittee delegation proposes to establish a military demarcation line on the actual ground contact line at the time of signing the armistice agreement, and both sides withdraw two kilometers from the agreed military demarcation line to establish a four-kilometer-wide demilitarized zone. The boundaries of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone may be adjusted slightly locally when both parties deem it appropriate. (2) The plenary meeting of the delegation will further discuss other agenda items, and then decide on the specific location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone boundary when the armistice agreement is about to be signed. (3) Each party will send three staff officers to form a committee, whose authority is to determine the location of the actual ground contact line under the guidance of the delegation holding the plenary meeting, so as to accurately determine the boundaries of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone."

Everyone can see at a glance: the Chinese and Korean side's proposal is a plan aimed at quickly reaching an armistice agreement. According to this plan, the subcommittee composed of representatives from both sides can immediately carry out the work of correcting the armistice military demarcation line and delineating the demilitarized zone in accordance with the clear agreement of on-the-spot ceasefire; at the same time, it is clearly stipulated that corresponding modifications must be made to the changes in the contact line between the two sides when the armistice agreement is reached. On the other hand, the U.S. side's proposal is a plan aimed at delaying the armistice negotiations. According to this plan, the agenda of "determining the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone as a basic condition for stopping hostilities in Korea" is actually completely overturned, and a committee composed of three staff officers from each side cannot carry out its work at all, because the U.S. side only agrees to "establish a military demarcation line on the actual ground contact line at the time of signing the armistice agreement." The result is that the work of determining the military demarcation line will be fruitless, and it will be restarted when the agenda items have yielded results, which will indefinitely delay the conclusion of the armistice agreement.

The Chinese and Korean side's plan is a plan that fully conforms to the interests of the people of the world, including the interests of American and British soldiers. According to this plan, the Korean armistice negotiations should not be difficult to reach a complete agreement quickly, so the international tense situation can be greatly eased, and world peace may be consolidated through the further efforts of the people of the world, and the participating soldiers can go home as soon as possible. In contrast, the U.S. plan is a plan to obstruct the rapid conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations, a plan to force the people of the world to continue to bear the heavy pressure of arms expansion and war preparation, and a plan to force American and British soldiers to continue to lose their lives in vain on the Korean battlefield by the thousands.

The U.S. side insists on its plan aimed at delaying the armistice negotiations and refuses to accept the plan put forward by the Chinese and Korean side, that is, it refuses to reach a clear and specific agreement on the issue of the armistice military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. What "reasons" do they have?

Their "reasons" are two. The first is that the demilitarized zone determined by the Chinese and Korean plan is "unchangeable"; the second is that the Chinese and Korean side wants to remove the U.S.'s "military pressure," that is, remove the "stimulus" that promotes the conclusion of other agenda items. Joy, the chief representative of the U.S. "United Nations" aggression army armistice negotiation delegation, said in a statement issued on the 11th of this month: "What the enemy (referring to the Chinese and Korean side) actually wants is to decide on an unchangeable demilitarized zone now. They want all the benefits of a de facto ceasefire so that they can prolong the armistice negotiations without any sacrifice. They want to remove our relentless military pressure - the 'stimulus' that is promoting a rapid agreement on other items."

Anyone who understands the truth will clearly recognize that Joy's arguments are a complete and utter pack of lies.

Everyone knows that the Chinese and Korean side's plan on the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone starts from the actual military situation, but at the same time, it is by no means "unchangeable," because this plan clearly stipulates: "After the entire armistice agreement is agreed upon but before it is signed, the above-mentioned military demarcation line and demilitarized zone must be modified accordingly in accordance with the changes in the actual contact line between the two sides at that time." It can be seen from this that the so-called Chinese and Korean side wants to "decide on an unchangeable demilitarized zone" is the most despicable lie in the face of the aggressors.

Secondly, Joy said that the U.S.'s "relentless military pressure" is the "stimulus" to promote the conclusion of the armistice agreement, which is an even more absurd excuse of the U.S. warlords. According to Joy's logic, then, to achieve peace, it is necessary to launch and continue the war of aggression; to promote the armistice, it is necessary to refuse to reach a clear agreement on the basic conditions for the armistice, and it is necessary to continue fighting. This is the logic of bloodthirsty American generals, this is the logic of war-mongers in the true sense of the word. The American generals have thoroughly exposed their true face of hating peace here.

Joy's statement that "American relentless military pressure" must be maintained, in addition to showing that the American aggressors are afraid that the Korean armistice will quickly become a reality, also contains the intention of flaunting the U.S.'s military strength to deceive the imperialist world. But this attempt is also extremely ridiculous and self-deceiving. We all know that the "military pressure" that the American generals have been boasting about, such as the so-called "general offensive to end the Korean War," has been completely crushed. Joy should understand best that he is not standing in Chushan City or Huishan Town on the south bank of the Yalu River now, but retreated to Munsan south of the 38th parallel to issue his statement. It is precisely because of this shameful failure of the U.S.'s "military actions," and under the pressure of public opinion from the people of the world, that the American aggressors were forced to hold armistice negotiations with our side. We all also know that the U.S. side's method of negotiating while attacking in the past four months or so, vainly attempting to carry out blackmail with "military pressure," has also been ineffective. According to incomplete statistics from July 10 to the end of October, the U.S. "United Nations forces" have paid a heavy toll of more than 178,000 casualties; and the number of enemy casualties has been almost twice as high as our army's casualties on average in these months. It is precisely because of this shameful failure of the U.S.'s "military pressure," coupled with the pressure of world public opinion on the American aggressors, that the U.S. armistice negotiation representatives have been forced to repeatedly modify their unreasonable demands regarding the armistice military demarcation line. The suggestion of having our side withdraw from an area of 12,000 square kilometers, the suggestion of having our side unilaterally withdraw from an area of 1,500 square kilometers (including Kaesong), now even the U.S. representatives dare not openly insist on it. So, who can the U.S. still use their "relentless military pressure" to scare?

If the U.S. actually believes that the issue of the armistice military demarcation line is a weapon in the hands of the U.S., and intends to wait until the changes in the contact line are most favorable to the U.S. before delineating the demilitarized zone, then it must be pointed out that this weapon is in the hands of both sides, and the Chinese and Korean side have even more reason and are indeed more confident to use this weapon. But if both sides have to fight until the changes in the contact line are most favorable to themselves before negotiating to determine the military demarcation line, then what is the meaning of the so-called armistice negotiations?

It can be seen from this that all the "reasons" for the U.S. side's refusal to accept our side's proposals on the armistice military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone are completely untenable, and the U.S. representatives' constant fabrication of various excuses to delay the progress of the armistice negotiations is the direct reason why these negotiations have not achieved any results until now.

Why do the U.S. imperialists continue to delay the Korean armistice negotiations? Their purpose, as before, is to continue to create and maintain the tense atmosphere of the international situation, so as to continue to expand arms and prepare for war in their country and force their vassal countries, and resist the ever-increasing movement of the people of the world demanding the realization of the Korean armistice, demanding the conclusion of peace treaties and general disarmament, so that the billionaires of Wall Street can continue to plunder huge war profits. A series of belligerent remarks by U.S. officials and semi-officials recently have proved the correctness of this assertion.

Truman has already indicated in his foreign policy speech on the 7th of this month that in order to continue to step up arms expansion and war preparation, the Korean negotiations must continue to be delayed. Because he said: as long as the war in Korea continues, "it is impossible to make real progress in disarmament." Acheson even asked its loyal vassal countries at the UN General Assembly on the 8th of this month to "make more contributions" to the war of aggression against Korea "in terms of troops and other needs." U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins openly said after inspecting the Korean front on October 29: "I don't know how much time [the armistice negotiations will take to reach an agreement], but I don't think an agreement will be reached in the near future." He clamored that the U.S. military is "prepared to fight another winter campaign." Wilson, the representative of the Morgan family in the U.S. government and director of the Defense Mobilization Agency, said as early as July that "the slightest easing of international tensions is a threat to the U.S. economy." In short, in the eyes of the Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon and DuPont families and their agents, the continuation of the Korean War and the continued maintenance of tension in the entire international situation are the "stimulus" for their war profits. The continued loss of lives of American soldiers by the thousands is the source of their wealth. This is the real reason why the Korean armistice negotiations continue to be delayed.

However, the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to obstruct and delay the Korean armistice negotiations and to insist on aggression and prepare to expand the war must be defeated and will certainly be defeated. The U.S. imperialists' belligerent crimes will never escape the condemnation of the people of the world. The shameful failures of the U.S. aggressors on the Korean battlefield in the past year or so have greatly strengthened the confidence of the people of China and Korea and the people of all invaded and oppressed countries in opposing wars of aggression and striving for democratic peace, and have created emptiness and multiple crises in the rear of the aggressors. Under such circumstances, it is even more impossible for the U.S. imperialists to intimidate the people of China and Korea, to continue to deceive world public opinion and to deceive their people and soldiers.

We Chinese people will continue to work hard and stand together with the Korean people to strive for the success of the Korean armistice negotiations. But at the same time, we must be prepared to force the enemy to accept a just peace by crushing the U.S. offensive after the negotiations fail due to the U.S. side's sabotage. The people of our country must respond to Chairman Mao's call to continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and carry out the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea until the enemy is willing to accept peace.

### 朝鲜停战谈判不能获得进展的根本原因何在？

　　朝鲜停战谈判不能获得进展的根本原因何在？
    朝鲜停战谈判自从十月二十五日恢复进行以来，又经过半个多月了。但是由于美国方面在谈判中继续采取阻挠和拖延的战术，以致谈判仍未获得任何进展。
    现在谈判仍然停留在第二项议程，即确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事区的问题上。为了使这项议程迅速获得协议，以建立停战的基本条件，我方代表已尽了最大的努力。在谈判恢复以后，出席小组委员会的我方代表即提出了以现有战线为基础，对整个战场加以全面调整的军事分界线方案。以后我方代表又进一步提出以就地停战为内容的确定军事分界线与非军事区方案。这两个方案和以前我方所提出的以三八线为停战军事分界线的方案一样，都是公平合理的，对双方都是完全平等待遇的。实际上除了这些方案之外，要另外找出任何公平合理的、对双方都是平等待遇的方案来，是绝对不可能的。但是美方代表却对这两个方案一概加以拒绝。为了对抗我方的合理方案，阻挠对停战军事分界线及非军事地区问题的协议，美方代表曾经提出并且坚持从现有接触线出发，片面地要求我方退出一千五百平方公里，妄想夺取我方开城地区的无理方案；以后，又进而提出暂不对军事分界线和非军事区作具体规定，实际上就是推翻双方早在七月二十六日即已一致同意的第二项议程的荒谬主张。
    现在事情已经很明白，我们方面和美国方面之间的根本分歧就是：我们方面的态度是努力要使确定双方军事分界线以建立非军事区的问题迅速获得具体协议，以建立停战的基本条件，然后即进入其他议程的讨论，以便使整个停战谈判尽快达成协议。而美国方面的态度则是极力避免对这项议程达成具体协议，以便无限期地拖延停战谈判。我们方面和美国方面的这种分歧，从双方代表在本月十日的小组委员会会议上提出的两个建议中可以看得很清楚。
    我方代表在本月七日即已提出，而在本月十日加以简化的方案是：“（一）确定以双方实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此线各退二公里，以建立非军事地区的原则。（二）小组委员会应即根据上项原则校正现有实际接触线，以确定双方同意的现有实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此确定军事分界线两侧各二公里之线为非军事区的南北缘，划出非军事地区。（三）小组委员会在停战协议全部商定后，但尚未签字前，必须按照双方实际接触线届时所发生的变化，对上述军事分界线与非军事区作相应的修改。”
    美方代表在本月五日即已提出，在本月十日稍加修改后再度提出，并于本月十一日加以条文化的方案是：“（一）为了确定双方之间的军事分界线，借以建立非军事区，作为停止朝鲜的敌对行动的基本条件，小组代表团建议在签订停战协议时的实际地面接触线建立军事分界线，双方从一致同意的军事分界线撤退两公里，以建立一个四公里阔的非军事区。军事分界线和非军事区的边界得在双方认为合宜时作小的局部调整。（二）代表团全体会议进而讨论其他议程项目，待即将签订停战协议时再决定军事分界线和非军事区边界的具体位置。（三）每方各派参谋军官三人组成一个委员会，其职权为在举行全体会议的代表团的指导下确定实际地面接触线的位置，以便准确地确定军事分界线和非军事区的边界。”
    大家一眼就可以看到：中朝方面的建议是以迅速达成停战协议为目标的方案。根据这个方案，由双方的代表所组成的小组委员会，可以立即按照就地停战的明确协议进行校正停战军事分界线及划定非军事区的工作；同时明确规定在停战协议达成时必须按照双方接触线的变化作相应的修改。另一方面，美国方面的建议是以拖延停战谈判为目标的方案。根据这个方案，“确定双方之间的军事分界线，借以建立非军事区，作为停止朝鲜的敌对行动的基本条件”的议程实际上等于全部被推翻，而每方各派三个参谋所组成的一个委员会根本无法进行工作，因为美方仅仅同意“在签订停战协议时的实际地面接触线建立军事分界线”。其结果就是使确定军事分界线的工作毫无结果，等到各项议程获有结果时再来从新开始，这样就会使停战协议的达成，无限期地拖延下去。
    中朝方面的方案，是完全符合全世界人民的利益，包括美英士兵的利益在内的方案。根据这个方案，朝鲜停战谈判不难迅速达成全部的协议，因而国际的紧张形势就可以大大缓和，世界和平就可能经过全世界人民的进一步努力而巩固起来，参战士兵就可以尽快地回家去。与此相反，美国的方案是阻挠朝鲜停战谈判迅速达成协议的方案，是迫使全世界人民继续负担扩军备战重压的方案，是迫使美英士兵在朝鲜战场继续成千成万地白白断送性命的方案。
    美国方面坚持他们的以拖延停战谈判为目的的方案，而拒绝接受中朝方面所提出的方案，也就是拒绝就停战军事分界线及非军事地区问题取得明确的具体的协议，他们有什么“理由”呢？
    他们的“理由”有两个，第一是认为中朝方案所确定的非军事区是“一成不变的”；第二是认为中朝方面想要解除美方的“军事压力”，即解除促使其他各项议程达成协议的“刺激物”。美方“联合国”侵略军停战谈判代表团首席代表乔埃在本月十一日发表声明说：“敌人（按指中朝方面）所要的实际是要在现在决定一个一成不变的非军事区。他们想要事实上停火的一切好处，以便他们可以无所牺牲而拉长停战谈判。他们想要解除我们的无情的军事压力——这个压力是促成对其他项目迅速获致协议的‘刺激物’。”
    任何明白事理的人都会清楚地认识，乔埃的这些论点是一派彻头彻尾的谎话。
    谁都知道中朝方面关于军事分界线及非军事区的方案是从现实军事情势出发的，但同时它绝不是“一成不变”的，因为这个方案明确地规定：“在停战协议全部商定后但尚未签字前，必须按照双方实际接触线届时所发生的变化，对上述军事分界线与非军事区作相应的修改。”由此可见，所谓中朝方面要想“决定一个一成不变的非军事区”，乃是侵略者的最卑鄙的当面撒谎。
    其次，乔埃说美国方面的“无情的军事压力”是促使双方达成停战协议的“刺激物”，这更是美国军阀最荒唐的藉口。按照乔埃的这种逻辑，那么，要实现和平，就必须发动和继续进行侵略战争；要促成停战，就必须拒绝就停战的基本条件达成明确的协议，就必须继续作战。这就是嗜杀成性的美国将军们的逻辑，这就是名符其实的战争贩子的逻辑。美国将军们在这里彻底地暴露了他们仇视和平的真面目。
    乔埃所谓必须保持“美国的无情的军事压力”的声明，除了表明美国侵略者害怕朝鲜停战迅速成为事实之外，还包含有炫耀美方的军事力量以欺骗帝国主义世界的企图。但是这种企图也是极端可笑而且自欺欺人的。我们都知道，美国将军们所大吹大擂的“军事压力”，如所谓“结束朝鲜战争的总攻势”之类，已经彻底地被粉碎了。乔埃应该最明白，他现在不是站在鸭绿江南岸的楚山城或是惠山镇，而是退到三八线以南汶山的地方，发表他的这个声明的。正因为美国的“军事行动”的这种可耻的失败，并在全世界人民的舆论压力下，美国侵略者们才被迫与我方举行停战谈判。我们大家也知道，过去四个多月来美国方面一面谈判一面进攻，妄想以“军事压力”来进行讹诈的办法，也没有任何效力。据自七月十日到十月底的不完整统计，美方“联合国军”已付出了十七万八千余人的惨重伤亡；而敌军伤亡的人数，在这几个月中几乎平均高出我军伤亡的一倍。正因为美国“军事压力”的这种可耻的失败，再加上世界人民的舆论对于美国侵略者的压力，美方停战谈判代表才不得不被迫地一再修改他们关于停战军事分界线的无理要求。什么要我方退出一万二千平方公里地区的建议呀，什么要我方片面地退出一千五百平方公里（包括开城）地区的建议呀，现在就连美方代表也不敢公然坚持了。那么，美方还能够拿他们的“无情的军事压力”来吓唬谁呢？
    如果美方竟然认为停战军事分界线问题是掌握在美方手中的武器，而打算等到接触线的变化对于美方最有利的时候，再来划定非军事区的话，那就必须指出：这个武器是掌握在双方的手里的，而且中朝方面更加有理由也确实更加有把握来使用这个武器。但是如果双方都要打到接触线的变动对自己最有利的时候，再来谈判确定军事分界线问题，那么所谓停战谈判还有什么意义呢？
    由此可见，美国方面拒绝接受我方关于停战军事分界线及非军事区的一切“理由”，都是完全不能成立的，而美方代表不断地捏造各种藉口来拖延停战谈判的进行，就是这个谈判直到现在还没有达到任何结果的直接原因。
    美帝国主义者为什么要继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判呢？他们的目的，和以前一样，就是为了继续制造和保持国际局势的紧张空气，以便在他们国内并强制他们的仆从国继续扩军备战和抗拒全世界人民要求实现朝鲜停战、要求缔结和平公约和普遍裁减军备的日益增涨的运动，以便使华尔街的亿万富翁能够继续掠取巨大的战争利润。美国官方和半官方最近一连串的好战言论，都证明了这个论断的正确性。
    杜鲁门在本月七日的外交政策演说中已经表示，为着要继续加紧扩军备战，就要使朝鲜谈判继续拖延下去。因为他说：只要朝鲜的战事继续下去，“要想在裁减军备方面取得真正进展，是不能的”。艾奇逊本月八日在联合国大会上更要求它的忠实仆从国“在军队及其他需要方面”对侵朝战争“作更多的贡献”。美国陆军参谋长柯林斯在十月二十九日视察朝鲜前线之后公然说：“我不知道〔停战谈判获得协议〕需要多少时间，但是我不认为在最近将来会获得协议。”他扬言美军“准备再打一个冬季战役”。摩根家族在美国政府中的代表、国防动员署署长威尔生早在七月间就说过，“国际紧张局势的丝毫缓和，都是对美国经济的威胁”。总之，在摩根、洛克菲勒、梅隆和杜邦家族及其代理人们看来，朝鲜战争的继续进行和整个国际局势的继续保持紧张，就是他们的战争利润的“刺激物”。美国士兵继续成千成万地白白送掉性命，就是他们富上加富的源泉。这就是朝鲜停战谈判继续被拖延下去的真正原因。
    可是，美帝国主义者阻挠和拖延朝鲜停战谈判，坚持侵略和准备扩大战争的阴谋，是必须被打败也是一定能够被打败的。美帝国主义者这种好战的罪恶行为，决不能逃脱全世界人民的责难。过去一年多以来美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上的可耻失败，已经大大增强了中朝两国人民和一切被侵略、被压迫国家人民反对侵略战争、争取民主和平的信心，并造成了侵略者后方的空虚和重重危机。在这种情况下，美帝国主义者要想恫吓中朝两国人民，要想继续蒙蔽世界舆论和欺骗他们的人民和士兵，已经是更加不可能了。
    我们中国人民仍将继续努力，和朝鲜人民在一起，争取朝鲜停战谈判的成功。但同时，我们必须准备在谈判因受美方的破坏而失败后，以粉碎美国的进攻来迫使敌人接受公正的和平。我们全国人民必须响应毛主席的号召，继续加强抗美援朝运动，增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，把抗美援朝的斗争一直进行到敌人愿意接受和平为止。
