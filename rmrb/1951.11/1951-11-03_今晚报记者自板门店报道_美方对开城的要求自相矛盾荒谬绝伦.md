    Jin Wanbao Reporter Reports from Panmunjom
    The US Demands on Kaesong are Self-Contradictory and Absurd
    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] Paris Jin Wanbao reporter, Be Qudi, sent a report from Panmunjom on the 2nd, saying: People hope that the representatives of both sides in the meeting tent at this moment can get results. The Korean and Chinese representatives informed the US side yesterday that they must clearly indicate today whether they agree to the new proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides to delineate the boundary line along the current battle line. The Korean and Chinese representatives told the US side very firmly yesterday that if they continue to demand to acquire Kaesong as a means to obstruct the rapid resolution of the second agenda item, it will seriously make people doubt their sincerity in seeking a ceasefire agreement. They were asked to reconsider their attitude and submit a clear reply this morning.
    The main content of the new delaying tactic is to raise the absurd demand to occupy Kaesong based on seemingly contradictory arguments. They said that they could have occupied Kaesong at any time in July this year, but they were just too lazy to go in. But today their main argument for demanding to enter Kaesong is that Kaesong is extremely important for the defense of Seoul. Therefore, people must ask, was the defense of Seoul not important in July this year? They said that when we suggested Kaesong as the meeting place four months ago, Kaesong was a no-man's land. However, the US side has been trying to move the negotiation site to a "place where both sides have equal rights" since then, precisely because Kaesong is in the hands of the Korean and Chinese troops. It is becoming clearer day by day that the demand for Kaesong is just one of the unacceptable demands repeatedly used by the US side to sabotage international conferences. They know, and the people of the world know, that the US demand for Kaesong cannot be accepted because the Korean and Chinese sides have been defending Kaesong, resisting any offensive that the US Eighth Army could launch against Kaesong.
    From the beginning of the ceasefire negotiations, the US side has been publicizing to the world that they hope to delineate the boundary line along the battle line. In fact, they have always demanded something else at the conference table, that is, a large piece of land in North Korea. But their lies have been exposed. The conditions put forward to them are exactly the conditions they claim they have always demanded. Future meetings can answer one question: will they continue to play a double game and expose this trick in front of the world, or do they hope for a fair ceasefire?

### 今晚报记者自板门店报道  美方对开城的要求自相矛盾荒谬绝伦

    今晚报记者自板门店报道
    美方对开城的要求自相矛盾荒谬绝伦
    【新华社二日讯】巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌二日寄自板门店报道说：人们希望此刻在会议帐篷内的双方代表能够得到结果。朝中代表昨天已告知美方今天他们必须明白表示是否同意朝中方面所提的沿目前战线划定分界线的新建议。朝中代表昨天已极其坚决地告知美方，如果他们继续要求取得开城作为阻挠第二项议程的迅速解决的手段，那就会使人们严重地怀疑他们有没有寻求停火协议的诚意。他们被要求重新考虑他们的态度，在今天上午提出明白的答复。
    新的拖延时间的手段的主要内容是根据似是而非的前后矛盾的论据提出占领开城的荒谬的要求。他们说，他们在今年七月当中本可以随时占领开城，只是懒得进去。但是他们在今天要求进入开城的主要论据是开城对汉城的防御万分重要。因此人们一定要问，难道汉城的防御在今年七月间是不重要的吗？他们说，当我们在四个月以前建议以开城作为会址时，开城是无人地带。但是，美方从那时以来一直竭力想把谈判地点移到“双方有平等权利的地方”，却正是因为开城在朝中军队手里。情况一天比一天明显，对开城的要求只是美方多次用来破坏国际会议的不能接受的要求中的一个。他们知道，全世界人民也知道，美方对开城的要求是不能被接受的，因为朝中方面一直在保卫开城，抵抗美国第八军可以对开城发动的任何进攻。
    从停火谈判开始时起，美方就已向全世界宣传他们希望沿战线划定分界线。事实上，他们在会议桌上始终要求另外一些东西，即北朝鲜的一大块土地。但是他们的大言被揭穿了。向他们提出的条件正是他们声称他们始终要求的条件。今后的会议可以解答一个问题：他们究竟是继续耍两面手法，在全世界面前暴露这种手法呢，还是希望公正的停火。
