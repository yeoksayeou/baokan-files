    The Soviet Union is an Indestructible Fortress of World Peace
    Celebrating the 34th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
    On November 7, 1917 (October 25th by the Russian calendar), the great October Socialist Revolution of the Soviet Union triumphed. At 10:45 p.m. that day, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets was convened at the Smolny Institute in Petrograd. This oil painting depicts Lenin announcing at the congress: "Power to the Soviets - Peace to the People." Now, under the banner of Lenin and under the leadership of the great leader Stalin, the Soviet people are marching towards a communist society. Due to the glorious victory of the Soviet October Revolution, the people of the world have been brought new hope. (Oil painting by a collaborative effort of Narbaengaan, Mashaninov, Piripiblovsky, and Suzdarizv)
    All the workers of the Soviet machine factories, in order to welcome the 34th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, participated in the socialist production competition before the October Revolution Day, producing many high-quality over-planned products. Pictured is the Vladimir Kovalev assembly team assembling a powerful cement mixer. The work team overfulfilled the plan by 230% in this production competition, achieving brilliant results.
    Under the leadership of the great leader Stalin, the Soviet people completed the first Five-Year Plan after the war and have now begun a great communist construction. In the massive construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, advanced "Volga River - 22" dredgers were used, which could dig 6,000 to 7,000 cubic meters of earth per day and night. The picture shows the dredger loading the mud dug from the bottom of the Volga River onto a ship.
    The powerful Soviet armed forces are the banner of world peace and the greatest guarantee of human safety. They are always ready to give a fatal blow to the aggressors who dare to launch a war. Pictured is a powerful Soviet army unit.
    In order to turn the desert into fertile fields, the Soviet Union decided to excavate the Turkmen Main Canal, which is 1,100 kilometers long, from the Amu Darya River to Krasnovodsk. The entire project will be completed in 1957. After the completion of this canal, 1.3 million hectares of farmland can be irrigated and reclaimed, and water can be diverted to the Kara-Kum Desert to turn it into 7 million hectares of pasture. The picture shows the engineering design of the Turkmen Main Canal.
    In accordance with Stalin's great plan to transform nature, large-scale artificial shelter forests have been cultivated in the Voronezh Province of Russia.
    Powerful Soviet naval forces.
    Heroic Soviet air force fighters.
    Powerful Soviet tank forces.
    Powerful Soviet artillery forces.
    In order to improve the semi-desert and arid areas of the Rostov and Stalingrad regions, the Soviet Union decided to excavate a 101-kilometer-long canal between the Volga and Don rivers. The main project is scheduled to be completed in the spring of 1952. The picture shows the water from the Don River flowing into the canal through the lock after the completion of the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station, one of the main construction projects of the Volga-Don Canal.
    In addition to carrying out the great communist construction cause for the motherland, the Soviet people have also demonstrated a high degree of internationalism by sending many experts to China to wholeheartedly help us with construction, so that our country's industrial and agricultural production has rapidly recovered and developed. The picture shows Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov studying the construction blueprint with Chinese engineering personnel at the Huai River harnessing construction site.
    The Soviet people love peace, and they have always expressed their determination to stop war. The picture shows Branich, a Stakhanov worker at the No. 1 furnace of the "Azovstal" factory in Zhdanovsk, signing in support of the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers.
    Soviet collective farm socialist labor hero Domnica Kadaria is signing in support of the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers.
    Soviet expert Login is guiding technical workers to learn advanced technology in the metal cutting training class held by our country's industrial sector.
    Soviet high-speed cutting expert Grashavchaev gave a lecture at the Beijing University of Technology, introducing in detail the advantages of the high-speed cutting method.
    The Soviet people convened the Second All-Soviet Peace Congress in Moscow on October 16, 1950, with more than 1,000 delegates attending the congress. The picture shows the Soviet writer Vasilevskaya speaking at the congress.

    苏联是世界和平的不可摧毁的堡垒
    庆祝十月社会主义革命三十四周年
    一九一七年十一月七日（俄历十月二十五日），苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利了。当天晚上十时四十五分在彼得格勒斯莫尔尼召开了第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会。这幅油画是描写列宁在大会上宣布：“政权属于苏维埃——和平属于人民”时的情形。现在苏联人民在列宁旗帜下在伟大的领袖斯大林领导下，正向着共产主义社会迈进。由于苏联十月革命的光辉胜利，给世界人民带来了新的希望。（油画·那尔巴恩加恩、马沙尼诺夫、皮里毕洛夫斯基、苏兹达里兹夫合作）
    苏联制造机器工厂的全体工人，为了迎接十月社会主义革命三十四周年，参加了十月革命节前夕的社会主义生产竞赛，制出了许多品质优良的超计划产品。图为乌拉奇米尔·郭瓦廖夫装配工作队正在装配强有力的水泥搅拌机。该工作队在这次生产竞赛中超额完成了计划的百分之二百三十，获得了辉煌的成绩。
    苏联人民在伟大领袖斯大林领导下完成了战后第一次五年计划后，现已开始进行伟大的共产主义建设。在建筑古比雪夫水力发电站的巨大工程中，使用了先进的“伏尔加河——二二”式挖泥机，一昼夜可挖六千到七千立方公尺的泥土。图为挖泥机将伏尔加河底挖出的泥土装到船上去的情形。
    强大的苏联武装部队是世界和平胜利的旗帜，是人类安全的最大保证。他们随时准备着给敢于发动战争的侵略者以致命的打击。图为强大的苏联陆军部队。
    为了使沙漠变成良田，苏联决定从阿姆河到克拉斯诺伏斯克间开凿一条全长一千一百公里的土库曼大运河，全部工程将在一九五七年完成。这条大运河完成后，可以灌溉和垦殖一百三十万公顷的农地并引水到卡拉·库姆沙漠使它变成七百万公顷的牧地。图为土库曼大运河的工程设计图。
    依照斯大林改造自然的伟大计划，在俄罗斯沃龙涅什省已培育起大规模的人造防护林。
    强大的苏联海军部队。
    英勇的苏联空军战士。

    苏联为改善罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州的半沙漠地区和干旱地区，从伏尔加河至顿河之间决定开凿一条全长一百零一公里的大运河，主要工程规定在一九五二年春天完工。图为伏尔加河和顿河主要建设工程之一的齐姆良水力发电站水闸完工后，顿河的水正经过水闸流入运河。
    苏联人民除了为祖国进行着伟大的共产主义建设事业以外，并发挥了高度的国际主义精神，派遣许多专家到中国来全心全意地帮助我们建设，使我国的工农业生产迅速地获得恢复和发展。图为苏联水利专家布科夫在治淮工地和我国工程人员共同研究施工蓝图时的情形。
    苏联人民是热爱和平的，他们随时随地都表示了制止战争的决心。图为日丹诺夫斯克“亚速钢”工厂第一号熔炉的斯塔哈诺夫工作者布拉尼奇正在签名拥护世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约宣言。
