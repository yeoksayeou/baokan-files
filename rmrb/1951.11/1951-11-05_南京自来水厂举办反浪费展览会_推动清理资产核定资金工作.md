Nanjing Waterworks Holds Anti-Waste Exhibition to Promote Asset Inventory and Fund Verification Work
　　Special Correspondent Ji Yin

　　The anti-waste exhibition held by the Nanjing Waterworks has powerfully promoted the plant's work of asset inventory and fund verification. Through this exhibition, a mass anti-waste movement has taken shape within the plant.
　　Before the asset inventory and fund verification, the plant's production and management suffered from serious waste. For example, the plant's existing machinery and equipment are sufficient for two plants of the same scale.
　　In order to break the complacency of most employees, the plant held an anti-waste exhibition. The exhibition revealed the various aspects of waste within the plant. For example, the accumulated funds section displayed a large pile of fuses, enough for the entire plant for ten years; there were four sets of control panels (switchboards), worth 90 million yuan, but they had never been used, and no one even knew where they should be used; one package of cotton yarn was enough, but ten packages were purchased, accumulating funds of 1,485,000 yuan. The plant's unsound systems also caused significant waste. For example, due to insufficient communication between the materials and purchasing departments, significant losses were incurred. There were over 400 pounds of yarn-wrapped wire that was purchased in the wrong size because the user department did not clearly communicate its requirements to the purchasing department, accumulating funds of over 20 million yuan; the unsound reporting and scrapping system resulted in the discovery of many usable materials from the scrap pile during this inventory; the unsound purchasing and acceptance system resulted in many newly purchased materials being unusable; the unsound materials requisition and management system led to the theft of many important materials. In addition, the loss of a large number of tools and the mold and damage of materials were also serious problems. The waste caused by not following operating procedures and the abuse of materials was alarming. One worker, in order to make a fire hose nozzle, cut off a small piece of a bar of foreign copper ingots worth over 1.8 million yuan, resulting in the destruction of this important material.
　　After seeing this exhibition, the employees felt very distressed. Wang Qingling, a worker in the water supply section, wrote in the comment book: "I feel heartbroken seeing this waste; this is the people's hard-earned money!" All the employees discussed the matter, feeling that the problem of waste was serious. The mood of complacency and paralysis was basically eliminated. All the groups in the plant launched heated discussions. On this basis, all the employees universally examined themselves. The waste of man-hours, which had not been raised at the exhibition, was also brought up; many small details were considered. Worker Xu Shusen said that in the past he used kerosene to wash his hands after work, which was too wasteful, and he would try to avoid it in the future. Everyone put forward many improvement measures to overcome waste, and some groups incorporated the elimination of waste into their patriotic pledges. After the exhibition, the "small warehouse" problem, the "using wide materials for narrow purposes" problem, and the communication between the purchasing and user departments began to be resolved. In the week after the Fund Verification Committee called for the cleanup of "small warehouses," the materials turned in by various units from the "small warehouses" were estimated to be worth over 20 million yuan. The head of the equipment section turned in 100 barrels of chlorine gas, which had been stockpiled for a long time and which he had previously been unwilling to sell, except for the part needed for turnover. Recently, the administrative section budgeted over 6 million yuan for making bed boards and stools, but later, due to the strengthening of communication between various units, it was discovered that the water supply section had scrap wood that could be used, saving over 6 million yuan.

    南京自来水厂举办反浪费展览会
    推动清理资产核定资金工作
    本报特约记者  季音
    南京市自来水厂的反浪费展览会，有力地推动了该厂清理资产核定资金的工作；通过这个展览会，该厂已形成了一个群众性的反浪费运动。
    在清理资产核定资金之前，该厂生产管理上的浪费是很严重的。如该厂现有的机器设备，足够同样规模的两个厂之用。
    该厂为了打破大部分职工的自满情绪，举办了反浪费展览会。展览会上，出现了该厂各个方面的浪费情形。例如，积压资金部分陈列着一大堆保险丝，足够全厂十年之用；控制台（配电板）有四套，值九千万元，但从来就没有用过，甚至什么地方要用也不知道；本来一包棉纱就够用了，却买了十包，积压了资金一百四十八万五千元。该厂制度不健全，也造成很大浪费。例如，由于用料和采购方面联系不够，造成了很大的损失。有四百多磅纱包线，因为用料单位未把要求明白告诉采购单位，以致买来尺寸不合需要，积压资金二千余万元；报损报废制度不健全，以致这次清点中，从废料中找出许多能用的器材；采购验收制度不健全，买来的新料许多不能用；用料报销制度和管理制度不健全，以致许多重要器材被人偷盗。此外，大量工具遗失，材料霉烂损坏现象也很严重。关于不按操作规程工作和滥用材料所造成的浪费，是很惊人的。一个工人因为要做消防皮带嘴子，把一杆值一百八十余万元的洋铜元，切去一小段。结果把这个重要材料糟塌了。
    职工们看了这个展览会之后，都感到非常痛心。供水课工人王庆龄在意见簿上写道：“我看了这些浪费，真是心痛，这是人民的血汗呀！”全厂职工议论纷纷，都感到浪费问题严重了。自满麻痹的情绪基本消除。全厂各小组展开了热烈的讨论。在这个基础上，全厂职工普遍地检查了自己。展览会上未提出的工时浪费也被提出来了；许多细小的地方都考虑到了。工人徐树森说，过去他工作后用煤油洗手，太浪费，以后要尽量避免。大家提出了许多克服浪费的改进办法，有的小组把消灭浪费订入了爱国公约。展览会后，“小仓库”问题，“宽打窄用”问题，采购与使用部门的联系问题，都开始得到解决。在核定资金委员会号召清理“小仓库”后的一星期中，各单位交出“小仓库”所存器材估价达二千余万元。器材科长把已积压了好久，过去一直不肯出卖的一百桶氯气，除留下周转必需的一部分以外，都交出了。事务股最近造床板、凳子，已预算六百多万，后因各单位间联系加强，发现供水科存有废木料取来使用，便节省了六百多万元。
