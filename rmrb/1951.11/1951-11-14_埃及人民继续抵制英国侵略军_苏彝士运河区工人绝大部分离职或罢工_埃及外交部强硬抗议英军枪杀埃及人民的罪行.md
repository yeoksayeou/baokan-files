　　Egyptian People Continue to Resist British Aggressor Troops
    Most Workers in the Suez Canal Zone Resign or Strike
    Egyptian Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests British Troops' Crime of Killing Egyptian People
[Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch] The Egyptian people's struggle to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and oppose the British military occupation of the Suez Canal Zone continues. The Egyptian people in the Canal Zone are distributing leaflets, calling on all people not to sell or transport goods to the British army, and to launch a non-cooperation movement against the British. Most of the Egyptian workers employed by the British authorities in the Canal Zone have resigned or gone on strike. Although the British military authorities are searching for workers everywhere and forcing them to work for them with bayonets, the Egyptian workers have not succumbed to violence. According to an announcement by Egyptian Minister of Social Affairs Hassan on November 3, of the 45,000 employees employed by the British, 40,500 have registered with the Egyptian Ministry of Social Affairs in order to be employed by the government, of which more than 20,200 have resigned from their British jobs.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch] TASS, Cairo: Egyptian newspapers published a strongly worded protest note from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to the British Embassy on November 9 regarding the evolution of the situation in the Suez Canal Zone since October 16. The note accuses British soldiers of shooting Egyptian soldiers and civilians, both men, women, and children, and of thefts committed by British soldiers. The note states: these acts are "simply plunder, and they are all the more odious because they are ordered by the responsible military authorities."
    The note states: The British authorities are attempting to isolate the Canal Zone from the rest of Egypt and turn it into a military base, and Britain has ignored Egypt's opposition to the four-power "defense" proposal for the Middle East.
    The note states: The Egyptian government protests against this blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and its territorial integrity, and believes that these violent acts committed by British troops in the Canal Zone "are reminiscent of the behavior of the Nazi authorities during the last world war." These kinds of actions "can only encourage and strengthen the spontaneous resistance movement of the Egyptian people."

　　埃及人民继续抵制英国侵略军
    苏彝士运河区工人绝大部分离职或罢工
    埃及外交部强硬抗议英军枪杀埃及人民的罪行 【新华社十三日讯】埃及人民为废除英埃条约、反对英军占领苏彝士运河区而进行的斗争仍在继续中。运河区的埃及人民散发传单，号召全体人民不出售物品、不运输物品给英军，对英国人展开不合作运动。运河区英国当局雇用的绝大部分埃及工人，均已离职或罢工。英国军事当局虽然到处搜捕工人，用刺刀强迫工人替他们工作，但是，埃及工人并未在暴力的面前屈服。据埃及社会事务大臣哈森在十一月三日宣布，在英方雇用的四万五千名雇员中，已有四万零五百人向埃及社会事务部登记，以便由政府雇用，其中二万零二百余人业已辞退英国的工作。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社开罗讯：埃及各报发表埃及外交部十一月九日向英国大使馆提出的关于十月十六日以来苏彝士运河区局势演变的措辞强硬的抗议照会。照会指摘英军士兵开枪射击埃及军人和平民男女和小孩，以及英军士兵所犯的盗窃罪行。照会中说：这些行为“简直是掳掠，而且因为它是由负责的军事当局命令士兵干的，所以就更加可恶了”。
    照会说：英国当局正企图使运河区与埃及其余地区隔绝，把它变成军事基地，英国竟将埃及反对四国关于中东“防御”建议一事置之不理。
    照会中说：埃及政府抗议此种分明侵犯埃及主权及其领土完整的行为，认为英军在运河区所犯的这些强暴举动，“会使人回想起上次世界大战期间纳粹当局的行为”。这类举动“仅能鼓励并加强埃及人民自发的抵抗运动”。
