    The Soviet Army is the Most Powerful and Invincible Army in the World
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhang Ming
    November 7th this year marks the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. I feel so close to this great festival, which is celebrated by people all over the world, as if it were our own Chinese festival.
    I remember this time last year, I was a young representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, visiting and learning in the Soviet Union with the Chinese youth delegation. During my visit to the Soviet Union, I visited many military schools, including the Suvorov Military School in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and the Lenin Military and Political Academy in Moscow. The Soviet Party and government attached great importance to the construction of the army, navy, and air force, especially to the training of officers. Many military schools were planned and instructed to be established by Comrade Stalin himself, and he gave them the greatest care. Comrade Stalin personally drafted instructions for the Lenin Military and Political Academy, requiring the academy to train a large number of military and political cadres. The deepest impression these schools gave me was that they were very formal and had strict military discipline, thoughtful etiquette, and a tense atmosphere of learning everywhere. Most of these military schools have a glorious combat tradition, and every student has a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism. During the Great Patriotic War, the students of the Lenin Military and Political Academy went to the front one after another, and many Soviet heroes emerged, including Comrade Sham Solov, the commander who planted the red flag on the German Reichstag in Berlin, and Comrade Foshov, a glorious member of the "Young Guard." After the war, the academy was awarded the Battle Red Flag Medal. In addition, I also met many Soviet heroes and generals, such as the outstanding communist hero "Flying General Without Legs" Malesiyev, each of whom was covered with medals. In the Soviet Union, I not only visited many military schools, but I also saw the powerful Soviet armed forces of all kinds, vigilantly defending the motherland. They possessed the most modern weapons and a high degree of technology. Since the end of World War II, the Soviet Union's progress in national defense construction has been amazing, and their combat effectiveness has greatly improved compared to the end of the Soviet-German War. In short, after these many visits, my overall impression is that the Soviet army is the most powerful and invincible army in the world. It was this army that crushed the German fascist hordes and defended human peace in the Great Patriotic War against German fascism. When I visited the heroic Stalingrad, I saw more clearly from the exhibits in the museum the unparalleled heroic deeds created by the Soviet army in defending Stalingrad. Only those who have personally experienced war can appreciate how serious the situation of the Soviet army was at that time, and how great the Soviet heroes who finally defeated the enemy were!
    Today, as we celebrate the 34th anniversary of the October Revolution, our motherland is threatened by the expansion of war by American imperialism. We especially need to learn from the heroic example of the Soviet army, learn the iron discipline of the Soviet army and the high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and learn the highly modernized military technology and combined arms combat experience of the Soviet army. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, by learning from the Soviet army even better, we will be able to quickly build a regular, modernized national defense force to defend our great motherland and peace in the East and the world.

    苏联军队是世界上最强大无敌的军队
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄  张明
    今年十一月七日，是苏联十月社会主义革命三十四周年纪念日。对这个为全世界人民所共同庆祝的伟大节日，我感到这样亲切，就像我们中国人民自己的节日一样。
    记得去年这个时候，我正作为中国人民解放军的一个青年代表，随着中国访苏青年代表团到苏联去参观和学习。在访苏期间，我参观了许多军事学校，包括乌克兰首都——基辅的苏沃洛夫军校，莫斯科的列宁军事政治学院等。苏联的党和政府是那样重视陆、海、空军的建设，特别是对于军官的培养训练。有许多军事学校都是斯大林同志亲自计划、指示开办的，并且给予最大的关心。对列宁军政学院，斯大林同志曾亲自起草指示，要求军政学院培养大量的军政干部。这些学校给我的最深的印象，就是非常正规和有着严格的军事纪律，周到的礼节，到处都充满了紧张的学习空气。这些军事学校大多都有光荣的战斗传统，每个学员都具有高度爱国主义精神和革命英雄主义气概。在卫国战争中，列宁军政学院的学员们纷纷走上前线，并且出现了许多苏联英雄，其中有将红旗插上德国柏林国会大厦的指挥员煞姆索洛夫同志以及“青年近卫军”中光荣的一员佛绍夫同志。战后该学院被授以战斗红旗勋章。此外，我还遇见许多苏联英雄和将军们，例如“无脚飞将军”马列西也夫那样的杰出的共产主义英雄，他们每个人的胸前都挂满了奖章。我在苏联不仅参观了许多军事学校，我也看到了正警惕地捍卫着祖国的苏联强大的各式兵种，他们拥有着最近代化的武器，以及高度的技术。第二次世界大战结束以来，苏联在国防建设上的进步是惊人的，他们的战斗力较之苏德战争结束之后，是大大地提高了。总之，经过这许多访问后，给我的总的印象是：苏联军队是世界上最强大无敌的军队。正是这支军队在反抗德国法西斯的卫国战争中，粉碎了德国法西斯兽军，捍卫了人类和平。当我参观英雄的斯大林格勒时，从博物馆的陈列品里，我更清楚地看到了苏联军队为保卫斯大林格勒所创造的无比的英雄事迹。只有亲身经过战争的人，才可能体会到当时苏联军队所处的情况是如何的严重，而终于战胜敌人的苏军英雄们是如何的伟大！
    今天，当庆祝十月革命节三十四周年的时候，我们祖国正受到美帝国主义扩大战争的威胁。我们特别需要学习苏联军队的英雄榜样，学习苏联军队铁一样的纪律性以及高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，学习苏联军队高度的现代化的军事技术和联合兵种作战的经验。我坚决相信，在毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导下，更好地向苏联军队学习，我们一定能够迅速建成一支正规化、现代化的国防军，以保卫我们伟大祖国和东方与世界和平。
