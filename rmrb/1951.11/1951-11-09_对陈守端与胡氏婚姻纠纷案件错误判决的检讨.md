    A Self-Criticism of the Erroneous Judgment in the Marriage Dispute Case of Chen Shouduan and Hu Shi
    Zhu Shuren, Vice President of Feng County People's Court, Shandong Province
    The circumstances and seriousness of the errors in our erroneous judgment of the marriage dispute case between Chen Shouduan and Hu Shi have been published in the newspaper. I fully acknowledge the facts published in the newspaper and sincerely accept the criticism of my erroneous thinking. To further eliminate my personal remnants of feudal thinking, I make the following self-criticism.

    I. My understanding of this case was fundamentally flawed. I did not approach this issue from the perspective of liberating women. At the time, I simply considered Chen Shouduan's concubinage and bigamy as consequences of the old social system and thus considered it legal. I did not recognize that this was an illegal act. Furthermore, I mistakenly regarded Hu Shi's escape from feudal rule and her struggle for self-liberation as "elopement." This error was formed partly because my policy understanding was not high, and I provided unconditional consideration to military dependents. Secondly, I harbored serious feudal ideas, which led me to uphold the old marriage system and violate the Marriage Law.

    II. Due to the remaining serious feudal ideas, when Chen Shouduan spoke of "marrying a wife to have children," I not only failed to offer forceful criticism and rebuke but blindly agreed. Basically, I held deep-rooted patriarchal ideas and feudal views that valued men over women and considered men superior to women. In addition, I also felt pity for Chen Shouduan at the time and feared that I would be responsible if he died.

    III. I wrongly awarded the child to Chen Shouduan, which was a form of appeasement. I thought that Hu Shi would be satisfied with achieving her basic requirement of divorce and failed to recognize that Hu Shi's fight with Chen Shouduan for the child was a struggle against feudalism. The formation of this erroneous judgment was a concrete manifestation of my unstable stance and political weakness.

    IV. The erroneous detention of Hu Shi and Chen Zhengsheng was because, although I recognized that Hu Shi's escape was a form of resistance to abuse, I also felt that since divorce and marriage procedures had not been completed, it was "elopement." According to Chen Shouduan, Chen Zhengsheng (Shouduan's nephew) had a "scheme for property," fearing that if Hu Shi had a child, he would not be able to inherit the family property. Therefore, I believed that Hu Shi's escape was instigated by Chen Zhengsheng. During interrogation, Chen Zhengsheng admitted that he had led Hu Shi away but denied any "scheme for property." Hu Shi, however, did not even admit that Chen Zhengsheng had led her away. Consequently, Chen Zhengsheng was detained. Looking back, the detention of Chen and Hu was fundamentally (Editor's note: not "fundamentally," but "completely") wrong. Regardless of how Hu Shi escaped, it was a revolutionary act against abuse, and it should have been supported, which would have been conducive to the liberation of women. Instead of supporting her, I detained Hu Shi. Now I deeply realize that this was an abuse of power, maintaining the remnants of the feudal marriage system, and seriously violating the Marriage Law.

    Based on the above analysis, I harbored feudal patriarchal ideas and serious male chauvinism, was politically backward, and had an unstable stance. Therefore, I made serious errors in the judgment of this case, hindering the implementation of the Marriage Law, affecting the development of the women's liberation movement, causing great losses to revolutionary work, and creating a negative impact on the People's Government.

    The main reasons why my feudal thinking has not been eradicated are:

    I. I usually do not study diligently and have a serious tendency to prioritize work over study. Not only have I not attached importance to the study of theory, but I have also failed to study policies and regulations well. Therefore, my policy understanding is not high, and I cannot make correct judgments when encountering problems, which led to serious errors in principle and policy in handling this case.

    II. I have failed to pay attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the meeting system is not frequent or strict, and I have not regularly conducted work inspections and ideological examinations, so work cannot be improved, shortcomings cannot be corrected, and thinking cannot be enhanced.

### 对陈守端与胡氏婚姻纠纷案件错误判决的检讨

    对陈守端与胡氏婚姻纠纷案件错误判决的检讨
    山东省丰县人民法院副院长  朱树人
    关于我们对陈守端与胡氏婚姻纠纷案件的错误判决，经过情形和错误的严重性，已在报上发表。我对报上所刊载的事实，完全承认，对报上对我的错误思想的批判，诚意接受。为进一步肃清我个人的封建残余思想，特作如下检讨。
    一、我对该案的认识有原则错误。我没有用解放妇女的观点去认识这一问题。当时对陈守端纳妾重婚，单纯地认为这是旧社会制度造成的，也就觉得是合法的。没有认识到这是一种非法行为。对胡氏逃脱封建统治、自求解放的反封建的斗争，更错误地认为是“私奔”。这种错误的形成，一是由于自己政策水平不高，对军属作了无原则的照顾。二是自己存在着严重的封建思想，以至维护了旧的婚姻制度，违背了婚姻法。
    二、由于残存着严重的封建思想，因之在陈守端谈到“娶妻为了生儿养女”时，不但没有加以有力的批判和责斥，反而盲目附和。基本上是自己存在着浓厚的以夫权为主的统治思想和重男轻女、男尊女卑的封建观点。另外，当时我还对陈守端存在着怜悯心，并且怕他死了我要负责。
    三、我错误地把小孩判给陈守端，当时是一种调和思想。认为胡氏能达到离婚的目的就满足了她的基本要求，没有认识到胡氏和陈守端争孩子，是一种反封建的斗争。这种错误判决的形成，是自己的立场不稳、政治上脆弱的具体表现。
    四、对胡氏和陈正升的错误扣押，是因为我虽然认识到胡氏之逃出是不堪虐待时的一种反抗，但又觉得既未办理离婚、结婚手续，就是“私奔”。又据陈守端说，胡氏之逃出是陈正升（守端之侄）有“谋财”企图，怕胡氏生了孩子不能由他继承家产，因此就认为胡氏之逃出是陈正升之挑拨。陈正升在被审讯时，承认胡氏逃走是他领出来的，但不承认有“谋财”企图。胡氏则连陈正升之领出也不承认。因之就把陈正升扣押。现在检查起来，扣押陈、胡，基本上（编者按：不是“基本上”，而是“完全”）是错误的。不管胡氏怎样逃出，总是反虐待的革命行动，应当加以支持，才有利于妇女的解放，而自己不但不予支持，反将胡氏加以扣押，现在我已深刻认识到这是滥用职权、维护残存的封建婚姻制度，严重地违背了婚姻法。
    根据以上分析，我是存在着封建的统治思想和严重的重男轻女意识，政治落后，立场不稳，因此在判处该案中犯了严重错误，阻碍了婚姻法的贯彻，影响了妇女解放运动的开展，使革命工作遭受了很大损失，给人民政府造成不良影响。
    我的封建思想没有肃清，其主要原因是：
    一、平时不认真学习，严重地存在着重工作、轻学习的偏向。不但没有重视理论的学习，而且也没有很好地学习政策法令。因此政策水平不高，遇到问题不能正确地判断，致使自己在处理该案上犯了原则上、政策上的严重错误。
    二、未能注意开展批评与自我批评，会议制度不经常、不严格，没有经常地进行工作检查和思想检查，所以工作不能改进，缺点不能纠正，思想不能提高。
