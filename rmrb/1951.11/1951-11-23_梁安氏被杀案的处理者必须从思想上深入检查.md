    Those Handling the Liang Anshi Murder Case Must Conduct a Deep Self-Examination

    The self-criticisms of Zhang Ze, Vice President of the Shangqiu Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Court, Guo Huanmin, Chief of the Judicial Section of Sui County, and Xuan Yuanzunyan, former Deputy District Chief of the Fourth District of Sui County, who were involved in the handling of the Liang Anshi murder case in Sui County, Henan Province, have criticized their serious bureaucratic, subjectivist, and non-mass line work styles, which is correct. However, these self-criticisms have not delved deeply enough into the root of the problem in their thinking. Take Zhang Ze as an example, he spent a great deal of space examining his serious subjectivism and undisciplined, liberal work style, which is necessary. However, there is a deep-seated ideological problem that he has not examined thoroughly enough, which is his emphasis on the murderer being an "honest farmer." It seems that if someone is an honest farmer (which is not the case), they can arbitrarily kill or force their wife to death, and the law should forgive or mitigate their crime. What kind of thinking is this? Isn't it because cadres are lenient towards their criminal behavior that some farmers dare to brutally kill or force their wives to death, making them think that killing or forcing a woman to death is not a big deal? Why doesn't Zhang Ze examine this kind of thinking? Guo Huanmin, the Chief of the Judicial Section of Sui County, in his self-criticism, vigorously emphasized that An Chongshan, who was seeking justice for Liang Anshi, was "domineering," "spoke frantically," "opposed the government," and "did not abide by the trial order" in court, so "I had no choice but to detain An Chongshan at the time." The husband and mother-in-law can arbitrarily kill women or force them to hang themselves, and the Deputy District Chief and the Chief of the Judicial Section can be so perfunctory, careless, irresponsible, and subjectively arbitrary in handling (including the autopsy) the tragic death of Liang Anshi, why shouldn't the person seeking justice be allowed to be even slightly indignant? Do we want the masses to be as frightened as if they were entering the yamen of the old society when they enter the people's court? In order to subdue the person seeking justice and make him obey the so-called "trial order" (the trial order that subjectively and arbitrarily affirmed Liang Anshi's suicide), the Judicial Section of Sui County unscrupulously labeled the person seeking justice with the label of "opposing the government" and detained him. How "crazy" is this infringement of human rights and "failure to comply with the trial order"! What a terrible impression this will make on the people about the people's judicial organs! Why doesn't Guo Huanmin examine these aspects well? Xuan Yuanzunyan made a self-criticism of his perfunctory and irresponsible autopsy work, which is good; however, he did not further see that this was a prominent manifestation of a lack of sympathy for the oppressed and tragically killed people. When Liang Anshi's family asked for a re-examination of the body, he refused. Why is that? Without conducting a thorough examination in this regard, it will be impossible to improve the consciousness of serving the people and being responsible to the people, and it will be impossible to completely change the perfunctory work style. We hope that the above-mentioned personnel will continue to conduct in-depth self-examination ideologically.

### 梁安氏被杀案的处理者必须从思想上深入检查

    梁安氏被杀案的处理者必须从思想上深入检查
    河南省睢县梁安氏被杀案的审理者河南省人民法院商邱分院副院长张泽、睢县司法科科长郭唤民以及前睢县第四区副区长轩辕尊言等的检讨，批判了自己严重的官僚主义、主观主义和不走群众路线等不良作风，这是对的。但这些检讨还没有深入到思想的根源。以张泽为例，他用很大篇幅检查自己严重的主观主义和无组织无纪律的自由主义作风，这是应该的。但有一个思想深处的问题，却检讨得很不深刻，这就是他强调凶手是“老实农民”。似乎既是老实农民（这并非事实），就可以随意杀死或逼死自己的妻子，法律上就应该予以宽恕、减轻他的罪过似的。这是什么思想？有些农民所以敢于惨杀或逼死妻子，还不是由于干部对他们的犯罪行为宽纵，因而使他们认为杀死或逼死一个妇女不算大事吗？张泽为什么不检讨这种思想？睢县司法科科长郭唤民的检讨，则是一股劲强调为梁安氏伸冤的安崇山在法庭上“盛气凌人”、“发言疯狂”、“与政府对抗”、“不遵守审讯秩序”，所以“当时无奈，遂将安崇山扣押”。丈夫和婆婆可以随意杀死妇女或逼得妇女上吊，副区长和司法科长对梁安氏惨死事件的处理（包括验尸）可以那样马虎草率，不负责任，主观武断，为什么伸冤者就不允许有丝毫激愤呢？难道我们要求群众进了人民的法院也要像进了旧社会的衙门一样吓得发抖吗？为了制服伸冤者，使伸冤者服从所谓“审讯秩序”（主观地、武断地肯定梁安氏为自杀的审讯秩序），睢县司法科肆无忌惮地给伸冤者扣上“与政府对抗”的帽子而把他扣押起来，这是多么“疯狂”的侵犯人权和“不遵守审讯秩序”！这将使人民对人民司法机关发生多么恶劣的印象！郭唤民为什么不很好地检查这些？轩辕尊言对于自己进行验尸工作时马虎草率，不负责任的现象做了检讨，这是好的；但他并未进而看到这是对被压迫被惨杀的人民缺乏同情心的突出表现。在梁安氏娘家要求重新验尸时，他竟予拒绝，这是为什么呢？不从这方面进行深刻检查，为人民服务、对人民负责的自觉性就不可能提高，应付差使似的作风就不可能彻底改变。我们希望上述人员继续从思想上进行深入的检讨。
