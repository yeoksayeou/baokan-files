Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th. The China Grain Company Southwest District Company has actively improved its business management. In the nine months from January to September this year, it saved the state 20 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs, and laid a good foundation for further carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has issued a circular of commendation for this, and awarded the company a "Model for Improving Business Management and Saving Expenses" banner.

Due to inconvenient transportation in the Southwest region and the relatively poor technical equipment of the China Grain Company Southwest District Company, transportation, loading and unloading, packaging, storage, and other costs account for a large proportion of commodity grain circulation costs. The company focused on this key link and improved it in all aspects. The first is to strive to simplify the transportation and sales process. For example, when receiving financial grain allocations in townships, the method of "selling directly from the warehouse" is adopted, which reduces a lot of loading, transportation, and unloading work. This item alone saved more than 5 billion yuan in transportation costs in the nine months of this year. For grain supplied to cities, the company adopts the method of "selling directly from the ship (or truck)" or directly allocating it to entrusted processing factories and selling it directly from the factory for pickup, which greatly reduces grain loading, unloading, loss, and warehouse weighing procedures. In the first half of the year, the entire region saved more than 1.48 billion yuan in expenses in this area. For grain that has been transported into warehouses, the company uses mobile processing tools to process it in the warehouse, saving the cost of round-trip transportation to and from the factory, and effectively avoiding theft. In Chongqing alone, more than 540 million yuan was saved in this area in the first half of the year. In terms of grain transfer, state-owned grain companies in various parts of the Southwest region and local people's government grain bureaus maintain close contact, and flexibly allocate and transfer grain to each other according to their needs, so as to avoid repeated grain transportation. There are many beaches and rapid currents in the rivers of the Southwest, and wooden boats cause great losses when transporting grain. This year, state-owned grain companies in various places have improved the organization of wooden boat transportation. Ship accidents, theft by boatmen, and natural losses during grain transportation have been significantly reduced. Therefore, although the total amount of grain transferred in the region in the nine months of this year increased by two and a half times compared with the whole of last year, the grain loss rate decreased by more than three-quarters compared with last year. In addition, state-owned grain companies in various parts of the Southwest region also regularly pay attention to selecting reasonable transportation routes when transporting grain, using backward transportation tools and surplus rural labor to transport grain, and organizing on-site processing, etc., saving more than 2 billion yuan in nine months. During the spring grain shortage in rural areas this year, state-owned grain companies in various parts of the Southwest region organized more than 200 sales teams to patrol and supply grain to rural areas. After the autumn harvest, they organized more than 300 procurement teams to go deep into rural areas to purchase surplus grain. In cities, they universally signed supply and sales contracts with factories and organizations to expand the sales area. In this way, the commodity grain circulation speed exceeded the original plan by two times. In terms of capital allocation and use, grain companies in various parts of the Southwest region adopted the method of "frequent and small allocations," which reduced capital backlog and accelerated capital turnover.

    中国粮食公司西南区公司积极改善经营管理
    九个月内节约商品流转费用二百亿元
    中央人民政府贸易部已通报表扬并奖予模范锦旗一面
    【新华社重庆二十六日电】中国粮食公司西南区公司积极改善经营管理，在今年一月到九月的九个月内，给国家节省了商品流转费用二百亿元，并为今后进一步开展增产节约运动打下了良好基础。中央人民政府贸易部为此已通报表扬，并奖予该公司“改善经营管理、节约费用开支的模范”锦旗一面。
    西南区交通不便，中国粮食公司西南区公司技术设备又比较差，因此在商品粮食流转费用中，运输、装卸、包装、保管等方面的费用占很大比重。该公司就抓紧这个主要环节，从各方面加以改进。首先是力求简化运销过程。例如在乡镇接收财政拨粮时，采取“就仓出售”的办法，减少了很多装运起卸工作。仅这一项，在今年九个月内就节省运费五十多亿元。对于供应城市的粮食，该公司采取“就船（或就车）出售”，或直接拨交委托加工的工厂，就厂出售提货的办法，大大减少了粮食起卸、耗损和进出仓库秤磅手续。全区上半年在这方面节省了十四亿八千多万元的开支。该公司对于已运进仓库的粮食，利用流动加工工具到仓库加工，节省了往返工厂调运费用，并有效地避免了盗卖现象。仅在重庆一地，上半年在这方面就节省了五亿四千多万元。在粮食调运方面，西南区各地国营粮食公司和当地人民政府粮食管理局之间经常保持密切联系，根据彼此需要，相互间灵活划拨、调运，以免粮食运输重复。西南河流滩多水急，木船运粮损失很大。今年各地国营粮食公司改进了木船运输组织，运粮中船只失事、船主偷盗和自然损耗都显著降低。因此，今年九个月中全区粮食调运数量虽比去年全年增加两倍半，但粮食损失率却比去年降低四分之三以上。此外，西南区各地国营粮食公司还经常注意在运粮时选择合理运输路线，利用落后交通工具和农村剩余劳动力运粮，以及组织就地加工等，九个月来节省了二十多亿元。西南区各地国营粮食公司在今年春季农村缺粮时，组织了二百多个推销组到农村巡回供应粮食，秋收后组织了三百多个收购组深入农村收购余粮；在城市里，又和各工厂、团体普遍签订供销合同，扩大销售面。这样，便使商品粮流转速度超过原订计划两倍。在资金调拨、使用上，西南区各地粮食公司采用“勤拨少拨”办法，减少了资金积压，加速了资金周转。
