    Jiang Qingshao, Member of the CPC Jinan City Fourth District Committee
    Loses His Stance, Helps Capitalists Struggle Against Workers
    Receives Expulsion from the Party and Apologizes to Workers
    Comrade Editor: Jiang Qingshao (a Party member), propaganda cadre of the CPC Jinan City Fourth District Committee, and Wu Xiuting (a non-Party member), cadre of the First Police Station of the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau, helped capitalists struggle against workers, completely losing their class stance. Jiang Qingshao has been expelled from the Party. This spring, the privately-owned Yihe Weaving Factory in Beitan, Jinan City Fourth District, accepted a batch of orders that had to be delivered in a very short period. Therefore, the capitalist side consulted with the labor side and requested the labor side to work overtime to complete the batch of orders. It was also proposed that if the task could be completed on time, each person would be awarded a uniform. However, after the task was completed, the capitalist side did not fulfill its promise and refused to issue uniforms to the workers. Workers Fan Chunzhi, Ma Shouxiao, and Li Wenbin questioned the factory manager Song Xiping about this, and a quarrel ensued. Later, Song Xiping, on the pretext that Li Wenbin had taken a piece of canvas from the factory, reported these workers to the First Police Station of the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau of the district. At that time, the First Police Station criticized Li Wenbin for not taking the factory's canvas and told the capitalist side that this matter could be handled according to factory regulations; but it was explained that this should not be confused with the recent labor-capital dispute. The capitalist side also agreed. However, Jiang Qingshao, the propaganda cadre of the district committee (who had participated in the factory's trade union law inspection work and had close ties with Song Xiping on weekdays), and Wu Xiuting, the cadre of the First Police Station of the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau of the district, suddenly convened a mass meeting of five or six hundred workers without authorization to struggle against workers Li Wenbin, Ma Shouxiao, and Fan Chunzhi, forcing the three of them to "reflect and examine themselves." Jiang even verbally abused the workers at the meeting. Wu Xiuting also openly made accusations against the workers. Song Xiping also verbally abused the three workers at the meeting. After the meeting, Jiang and Wu detained the three workers in the police station for several hours. The workers were extremely dissatisfied with this incident, and some workers felt that the trade union did not provide protection and demanded to withdraw from the trade union.

    After the incident, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Jinan Municipal Committee conducted an investigation and understanding, and believed that Jiang Qingshao's behavior of hating the working class had completely lost the stance of a Communist Party member. It was decided to expel him from the Party and order him to publicly examine his mistakes to the workers. Wu Xiuting acted as Jiang's accomplice and arbitrarily detained workers, showing a vague class consciousness and should be given due administrative punishment. The district committee also showed serious bureaucracy in dealing with this issue. It originally knew that there was a dispute between labor and capital in the factory, and also knew that Jiang Qingshao was going to convene a meeting, but did not pay attention to it. Although it went to comfort the insulted workers afterwards, it still could not make up for the damage caused by this incident and should make a profound self-criticism.

    中共济南市四区区委会姜庆绍
    丧失立场帮助资本家斗争工人
    受开除党籍处分并向工人认错
    编辑同志：中共济南市四区区委员会宣传干事姜庆绍（党员）和公安四分局第一派出所干事吴秀庭（非党员）帮助资本家斗争工人，完全丧失了阶级立场。姜庆绍已被开除党籍。济南市四区北坛私营义合织布工厂，今春接受了一批订货，要在很短时期内将货交清，因此资方与劳方商量，要求劳方加班加点完成这批订货。并提出如能按时完成任务，奖给每人制服一套。但在任务完成后，资方却不执行诺言，拒绝发给工人制服。工人范春芝、马守孝、李文斌即向该厂经理宋希平提出质问，双方因此发生争吵。后宋希平借口李文斌拿了厂里的一块帆布，把这些工人告到该区公安四分局第一派出所。当时第一派出所就批评了李文斌不应拿厂里的帆布，同时告诉资方对此事可以按厂规处理；但说明这决不能与最近的劳资纠纷问题混为一谈。资方也同意。可是该区区委宣传干事姜庆绍（曾参加该厂工会法检查工作，平日与宋希平来往甚密）和该区公安四分局第一派出所干事吴秀庭突然擅自召开五、六百人的工人群众大会，斗争工人李文斌、马守孝、范春芝，强迫他们三人“反省检讨”。姜在大会上甚至谩骂工人。吴秀庭当场亦对工人横加指责。宋希平在这个会上对三个工人也辱骂了一顿。会后姜、吴并将三个工人在派出所扣押数小时。工人群众对此事极为不满，有些工人感到工会不给保障，要求退出工会。
    事情发生后，中共济南市委纪律检查委员会就进行了调查了解，认为姜庆绍这种仇视工人阶级的行为，已完全丧失了共产党员的立场，决定开除其党籍，并要他向工人群众公开检讨自己的错误。吴秀庭作了姜的帮手，随便扣押工人，表现了阶级意识模糊，行政上给予应得处分。该区区委员会对待这一问题亦表现了严重的官僚主义，原来就知道该厂劳资双方存在着纠纷，也知道姜庆绍去召开大会，但未加重视。事后虽去慰问了受辱工人，但仍不能弥补这次事件所造成的损失，应作深刻检讨。
