To continue strengthening the content of patriotism in school education is an important link in further carrying out patriotic propaganda and education throughout the country. At present, there are more than 52.2 million students in the country (including spare-time schools for workers and peasants). If schools are used as propaganda stations for patriotic education, and if each student can regularly promote it to an average of three people, then more than 156.66 million people across the country can regularly receive patriotic education.

Over the past year, schools at all levels have made achievements in carrying out patriotic education, and the national self-esteem, self-confidence, and patriotic enthusiasm of teachers and students have been significantly improved. Many teachers and students in schools have also carried out propaganda to the masses. For example, in Shanghai, 66 percent of primary school teachers went out to carry out propaganda, and according to statistics from 14 districts, there were more than 600 propaganda teams. In Hebei Province, last winter vacation, 90,000 primary school teachers, winter school teachers, and more than one million students participated in the propaganda work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, covering 60 percent of the local population.

However, at present, many schools still do not pay enough attention to patriotic education, and some still seriously have a tendency of not concerning themselves with politics, allowing backward, erroneous, and even reactionary ideas to grow and spread among teachers and students while turning a blind eye. The results of current affairs tests conducted among teachers in some schools showed that more than half of them failed. Some schools spread erroneous, purely technical viewpoints among students, such as "You can still serve the people without understanding politics, but you have no capital to serve the people without understanding technology" and "If you study mathematics, physics, and chemistry well, you won't be afraid of anyone." Some students are even tired of political life, and some teachers are not active enough in publicizing the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, preventing students from attending military cadre schools. The above extremely serious anti-patriotic thoughts, speeches, and behaviors are absolutely intolerable, and education administrative departments at all levels must promptly conduct inspections and corrections.

Although some schools have paid attention to patriotic education, because teachers do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of strengthening patriotic education in schools, teachers themselves are studying poorly, and they lack systematicness and thoughtfulness when lecturing to students, and they are only some dogmas or empty slogans, without lively and fresh content, or scattered fragments of phenomena, without a basic viewpoint and central idea that runs through everything, so the effect of education is not great.

Patriotism is an important aspect of Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the central idea to carry out patriotic education among the people, in order to give full play to the infinite potential power of the Chinese people, to defeat the enemy and build the motherland.

It is necessary to carry out patriotic education among students, to praise our country's glorious history and the struggle of the masses, and to praise our country's beautiful rivers and mountains and abundant resources, but more importantly, to educate students to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese people's diligence, bravery, hard work, and plain living, to give full play to their wisdom and creativity, to not fear dangers and difficulties, to devote themselves to the just struggle against aggression in order to defend the glory of the motherland, and to engage in the construction of the motherland for the interests of the people. Not only should students know that the Chinese nation is a great nation accounting for a quarter of the world's population, but more importantly, they should understand that 80 to 90 percent of them are workers and peasants, who are the real creators and builders of the great motherland, thereby developing young students' love for labor and the working people, fully trusting the power of the masses, strengthening the mass viewpoint, and integrating individual interests with the interests of the working people. It is necessary to make students understand the great victories and achievements in all aspects of the People's Republic of China in the past two years, as well as a large number of heroic figures and model deeds, and also make them recognize the political and economic basis for producing this new heroism, and recognize that our new democratic political system and economic system have great advantages over the capitalist political and economic system, thereby strengthening their support for new democracy, and their determination to defend, consolidate, and expand the people's democratic dictatorship, and to strive for a better socialist society and communist society. It is also necessary to make them recognize that this victory and achievement is the result of the united struggle of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class party—the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, thereby faithfully trusting the Chinese Communist Party, supporting the Central People's Government, and loving the people's leader Chairman Mao. Make them realize that this victory and achievement is also inseparable from the solid unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the profound sympathy of the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, from which to understand the relationship between the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and understand the unity of patriotism and internationalism, thereby supporting the internationalist alliance between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the working people all over the world, and jointly struggling for the liberation of all mankind. Our country not only has a vast territory and a great people, but also has a great guiding ideology and a firm will to carry out a just struggle. This contains the infinitely rich content of our patriotic education.

To correctly carry out patriotic education among our new generations and the masses is a serious and major political task for teachers and educators across the country. This requires us to earnestly study and master Mao Zedong Thought, carry out self-education and self-transformation movements, improve our political and ideological level, and strive to continue to strengthen the content of patriotism in school education.

### 继续加强学校教育中爱国主义的内容

    继续加强学校教育中爱国主义的内容
    继续加强学校教育中爱国主义的内容，是在全国进一步开展爱国主义宣传教育的重要环节。目前全国共有五千二百二十余万学生（包括工农业余学校在内）。假如以学校为爱国主义教育的宣传站，又假如平均每个学生能够经常向三个人作宣传，则全国便有一亿五千六百六十余万人能够经常受到爱国主义的教育。
    一年来各级学校在进行爱国主义教育方面是有成绩的，教员、学生的民族自尊心自信心和爱国热忱已有显著提高。不少学校的教员学生还向群众作了宣传。如上海市有百分之六十六的小学教员出动宣传，据十四个区统计就有六百余宣传小队；河北省去年寒假时有九万小学教员、冬学教员和百万以上的学生参加了抗美援朝的宣传工作，宣传面及于当地人口的百分之六十。
    但是，目前还有不少的学校对爱国主义教育重视不够，有的还严重地存在着不问政治的倾向，听任落后的、错误的甚至是反动的思想在教员学生中滋长蔓延而熟视无睹。有些学校在教员中进行时事测验的结果，不及格的竟达半数以上。有些学校在学生中散布着“不懂政治还可以为人民服务，不懂技术就根本没有为人民服务的资本”、“学好了数理化，谁来了也不怕”等错误的单纯技术观点。甚至有的学生厌倦政治生活，有的教员对宣传抗美援朝工作表现不够积极，阻止学生参加军事干部学校。以上种种极端严重的反爱国主义的思想、言论和行为，是绝对不能容忍的，各级教育行政部门必须迅速进行检查和纠正。
    还有些学校虽然注意了爱国主义教育，但由于教员对加强学校爱国主义教育的重要性认识不足，教员本身的学习就很差，向学生讲起来就缺乏系统性和思想性，而只是一些教条或空洞的口号，没有生动活泼的新鲜内容，或是零星片断地罗列现象，没有一个贯串一切的基本观点和中心思想，因而教育的效果是不大的。
    爱国主义思想是毛泽东思想体系中的一个重要方面。我们必须以毛泽东思想为中心思想来向人民进行爱国主义教育，才能充分发挥中国人民无穷尽的潜在力量，以战胜敌人，建设祖国。
    向学生进行爱国主义教育，歌颂我们祖国光荣的历史和人民群众的斗争，歌颂我们祖国的锦绣河山、地大物博都是必要的，但更重要的是教育学生继承和发扬中国人民勤劳、勇敢、刻苦朴素的优良传统，充分发挥他们的智慧与创造力，不畏艰险困难，为了保卫祖国光荣而献身于反对侵略的正义斗争，为了人民的利益而从事祖国的建设事业。不仅要让学生知道中国民族是占世界人口四分之一的伟大的民族，更重要的是要使他们了解其中百分之八、九十是工农劳动人民，他们是伟大祖国的真正缔造者与建设者，从而发展青年学生热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的思想感情，充分信任人民群众的力量，加强群众观点，把个人的利益与劳动人民的利益结合成一体。要使学生了解中华人民共和国成立两年来各方面的伟大胜利和成就以及大批的英雄人物、模范事迹，还要使他们认识产生这种新英雄主义的政治、经济基础，认识我们新民主主义的政治制度和经济制度，较之资本主义的政治、经济制度具有极大的优越性，从而加强他们的拥护新民主主义，为保卫、巩固和扩大人民民主专政，为实现更美好的社会主义社会与共产主义社会而斗争的决心。还要使他们认识这种胜利与成就，是在工人阶级政党——共产党和毛主席领导下，全国人民团结奋斗的结果，从而忠诚地信赖中国共产党，拥护中央人民政府，热爱人民领袖毛主席。使他们认识这种胜利与成就，又是和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的巩固团结与世界各国爱好和平的人民的深厚同情分不开的，从这里去体会中国革命与世界革命的关系，体会爱国主义与国际主义的统一性，从而拥护中国与苏联和人民民主国家以及全世界劳动人民的国际主义的联盟，共同为争取全人类的解放而斗争。我们的国家，不仅有广大的领土，伟大的人民，还有伟大的领导思想和进行正义斗争的坚决意志。这里包含着我们进行爱国主义教育的无限丰富的内容。
    向我们的新后代和人民群众正确地进行爱国主义教育，是全国人民教师和教育工作者严肃的重大的政治任务。这就要求我们认真地学习与掌握毛泽东思想，开展自我教育、自我改造的运动，提高政治思想水平，为继续加强学校教育中爱国主义的内容而努力。
