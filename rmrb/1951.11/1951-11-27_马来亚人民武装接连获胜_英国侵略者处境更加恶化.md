Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Singapore News: The heroic battles waged by the Malayan National Liberation Army and the Malayan people are making the situation of the British aggressors in Malaya increasingly worse.

In mid-November, the National Liberation Army launched a series of successful ambushes against British police, security teams, etc., in Johor, Kedah, Perak and other states, inflicting casualties on the enemy and derailing a train from Singapore.

The armed struggle of the Malayan people has caused great panic among the British aggressors. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 14th, Lord Listowel, former Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in the Labor government, admitted that the situation of the British aggressors in Malaya was "bleak and unpleasant." "After three and a half years of war," "the situation has not improved." Speaking of the Malayan National Liberation Army, he said that the British army had "not only failed to defeat them, but also failed to drive them out of any state in the (Malayan) Federation." He also revealed that since the implementation of the so-called "Emergency Regulations" in June 1948, the British army had "suffered more casualties in October this year than in any other month." He said that if "the stalemate in Malaya continues," Britain's colonial economy in Malaya "will be dragged down."

MacDonald, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, who recently went to Burma, also had to admit in Rangoon: "The situation in Malaya is more serious than at any time in the past three years." (Telegraph Agency London, 20th) According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 15th, British officials revealed that under the heavy blows of the Malayan National Liberation Army, rubber production in the three states controlled by the British colonists in Malaya (Note: The Federation of Malaya has nine states in addition to the two administrative units of Penang and Malacca) has come to a standstill. A British government report admits that British casualties exceed those of the Malayan National Liberation Army, and that "every guerrilla casualty costs Britain and the Federation of Malaya more than 100,000 US dollars."

British imperialism is plotting to intensify the suppression of the Malayan people's national liberation struggle. According to the Associated Press, Colonial Secretary Lyttelton of the Churchill Cabinet "has been ordered to strengthen the leadership structure in Malaya. Lyttelton and his advisors are discussing plans for a counter-offensive." Moreover, Lyttelton will go to Malaya to conduct new planning.

However, the British aggressors clearly do not have much confidence in the war of aggression they are waging in Malaya. Mowll, the British aggressor who serves as the Deputy Minister of Economy of the "Federation of Malaya," said in San Francisco on the 16th, in a panic: The "protracted war" waged by the Malayan National Liberation Army against the British army "is a dangerous struggle with no end in sight."

### 马来亚人民武装接连获胜  英国侵略者处境更加恶化

    马来亚人民武装接连获胜
    英国侵略者处境更加恶化
    【新华社二十四日讯】新加坡消息：马来亚民族解放军和马来亚人民所进行的英勇战斗，正使英国侵略者在马来亚的境况越来越恶化。
    在十一月中旬，民族解放军在柔佛州、吉打州和霹雳州等地对英国警察、保安队等进行了一连串胜利的伏击，使敌人遭受了死伤，并曾使从新加坡开出的一列火车出轨。
    马来亚人民的武装斗争，使英国侵略者十分恐慌。据路透社伦敦十四日电，曾任工党政府殖民副大臣的李斯多威尔承认：英国侵略者在马来亚的处境，是“黯淡而且令人不快的”。“经过了三年半的战争”，“局势并没有改善”。他谈到马来亚民族解放军时说：英国军队“不仅未把他们打败，也未能把他们从（马来亚）联邦任何一州驱逐出去。”他并且透露：自一九四八年六月实行所谓“紧急法令”以来，英国军队“在今年十月份的死伤人数，比其他任何一个月份都多。”他说：如果“马来亚的僵局拖下去”，英国在马来亚的殖民经济“将被拖垮”。
    最近赴缅甸的英国东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳在仰光也不得不承认：“马来亚局势比过去三年中任何时候都要严重。”（电通社伦敦二十日电）另据美联社伦敦十五日电：英国官员透露：在马来亚民族解放军的沉重打击下，英国殖民者所控制的马来亚的橡胶生产已在三个州（按：马来亚联合邦除槟榔屿和马六甲二行政单位外，共有九个州）陷于停顿。英国政府的报告承认：英军的死伤超过马来亚民族解放军，而且“每伤亡一个游击队，需要英国和马来亚联邦花费十万美元以上的代价”。
    英帝国主义正策划对马来亚人民的民族解放斗争加紧进行镇压。据美联社说：邱吉尔内阁的殖民大臣里特尔顿“奉命着手进行加强马来亚的领导机构。里特尔顿和他的顾问们正在讨论反攻的计划”。而且，里特尔顿将到马来亚进行新的策划。
    但是，英国侵略者对他们在马来亚所进行的侵略战争，显然没有多大信心。担任“马来亚联邦”经济部副部长的英国侵略分子毛莱十六日在旧金山恐慌地说：马来亚民族解放军对英军所进行的“持久战”，“是危险的没有停止期限的斗争”。
