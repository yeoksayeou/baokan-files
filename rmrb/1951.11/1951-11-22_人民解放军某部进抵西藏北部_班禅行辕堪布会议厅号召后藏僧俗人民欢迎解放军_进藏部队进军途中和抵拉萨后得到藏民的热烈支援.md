Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 21st: News from Heihe: According to the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing towards Tibet from the Northwest, after marching over three thousand miles and crossing the vast grasslands of southern Qinghai, reached Heihe, an important town in northern Tibet, on the 4th of this month. When the unit arrived in Heihe, it was warmly welcomed by local Tibetan government officials and Tibetan compatriots. Renmuxi (secular official), the Heihe Governor of the Tibetan local government (equivalent to commissioner), Tudan Sangbu (monastic official), and Risajia Geng, the chief officer of the 5th Daiben (equivalent to regiment) stationed in Heihe, led all the officials of the Governor's Office, all the officers and soldiers of the 5th Daiben, and more than a thousand Tibetan people to the suburbs to welcome the unit, and presented Hada scarves to General Fan Ming, the commander of the unit, and General Mu Shengzhong, the political commissar, as a sign of respect. As the majestic cavalry procession passed through the city, the streets, alleys, rooftops, and the tall buildings of the monasteries were crowded with welcoming crowds. People were dressed in festive attire, enthusiastically welcoming the troops. Women and children waved and cheered excitedly, paying their respects to the commanders and fighters of the unit. Note: Heihe, also known as Naqu'e, is a key transportation hub between Qinghai and Tibet and a military, political, and commercial center in northern Tibet. It has about 300 households, and the monasteries have about 1,500 lamas and Tibetan soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 21st: The Khenpo Council Hall of the Panchen Lama's Office issued a circular telegram on the 17th to political and religious officials, monks, and the public in Zhaxilhunbu and Xigaze in Rear Tibet, calling on them to welcome and support the People's Liberation Army's entry into Xigaze. The telegram said:

"The People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, after a long journey and experiencing many hardships, have victoriously entered Lhasa, the important western town of the motherland. All the personnel of the Khenpo Council Hall extend congratulations to General Zhang Guohua, commander of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, and all commanders and fighters, and call on the political and religious officials, monks, and the public in Zhaxilhunbu and Xigaze in Rear Tibet to actively prepare for a grand gathering to welcome the People's Liberation Army's entry into Xigaze city. The people of Xigaze city should voluntarily supply the People's Liberation Army with food, fodder, and vegetables, and engage in fair trade, lending the troops all the utensils they need. The entry of the Liberation Army into Tibet marks a new unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and what follows will be various construction projects for the political, economic, and cultural development of the Tibetan people. Therefore, we Tibetan people should actively and voluntarily assist the troops entering Tibet, provide them with various conveniences, and establish close cooperation to jointly strive for the thorough implementation of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet."

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 21st: The People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet received warm support from the Tibetan people on their way to Lhasa. In the vast areas of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen in the thousands of miles between the northwest and southwest of Qamdo, thousands of yak and mule transport teams were formed, transporting supplies for the troops back and forth. The Tibetan people in the Luolongzong area sent all the horses they could spare from their homes to participate in the transportation. To improve transportation efficiency, they also organized long-distance relay transportation. The Tibetan people in the southwest of Qamdo, in the extremely difficult environment of heavy snow blocking the mountains, also voluntarily gathered 700 yaks to transport grain to the roadside to support the People's Liberation Army passing through. During the transportation of supplies, the Tibetan people cherished the supplies more than their own bodies. In the event of heavy rain or snow, they would rather endure the cold themselves and cover the grain bags with their own felt blankets.

Wherever the Liberation Army passed, the Tibetan people had long prepared grain, vegetables, firewood, and fodder for the troops. The Tibetan people carried supplies from distant pastures, villages, and deep mountains to the roadside by human and animal power. In the severely cold northwest of Qamdo, firewood was scarce, but the Tibetan people, upon hearing that the Liberation Army was passing through, had been busy storing more than one million catties of firewood and dried cow dung (for fuel) for the troops a month in advance. Twenty-four young and strong men from Jiasacun village, Dingqingzong in the area, spent a month preparing 100,000 catties of firewood and dried cow dung for the troops. The Tibetan people of Sezhazong, fearing that the Liberation Army would not be accustomed to burning cow dung, specially braved the wind and snow to transport firewood from a hundred miles away. The Tibetan people along the way carried ghee, dry cakes, cigarettes, raisins, and other items to welcome the Liberation Army on the road to Lhasa, cupping their hands in prayer for the safe arrival of the army in Lhasa.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 21st: The Tibetan people in the Lhasa area warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. For more than a month, Tibetan people from various places have sold tens of thousands of catties of zanba, rice, flour, and large quantities of vegetables, firewood, and fodder to the advance detachment of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet. The Works Bureau of the Tibetan local government organized more than 100 civil engineering workers to repair barracks and stables for the troops. After seeing the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army speak kindly, conduct fair trade, and take the lead in building roads and transporting firewood, the Tibetan people supported and loved their army even more. Many Tibetan people traveled for several days, transporting large quantities of grain and grass to Lhasa from remote places using various means of transportation such as mules, yaks, and skin boats to sell to the Liberation Army. They also signed pre-sale contracts with the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet. When the large army entering Tibet led by General Zhang Guohua was about to arrive in Lhasa, 32 Tibetan carpenters who were making desks, chairs, and leather beds for the troops worked day and night, making two or three more finished products per day than before. The farmers enthusiastically drove large numbers of mules and yaks to transport grain and firewood to welcome the large army. On the vast Lhasa plain, transport teams of Tibetan people could be seen everywhere, advancing towards Lhasa in an endless stream amidst joyful songs. The People's Liberation Army on the Lhasa Plain

In their march towards Lhasa, the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet won unanimous praise from the Tibetan people along the way for their strict adherence to discipline and exemplary actions of cherishing the people: "Chairman Mao's troops are so good!"

During more than 50 days of marching in the rainy season, the commanders and fighters of the troops entering Tibet endured the wind and snow, setting up their tents in the wilderness and never living in civilian houses or Lama temples. Before each departure, they also filled in the drainage ditches, stoves, and toilets next to the tents with soil. The Tibetan people prepared firewood at every post along the way, but the commanders and fighters, in order to reduce the burden on the Tibetan people, often went up the mountains to collect firewood themselves. Sometimes they burned the firewood of the Tibetan people, and they paid the equivalent amount of money. The breeders of the troops took great care of the crops of the Tibetan compatriots. After camping every day, they guarded the grazing livestock closely, preventing the livestock from trampling the crops. Once, when the troops were stationed in a village, the livestock trampled on a small piece of qingke field less than three square meters in size. They immediately went to the owner's house to apologize and compensated them with three silver dollars. The entire village of Tibetan people was very moved by this.

When the troops entering Tibet crossed countless snowy mountains and ice rivers and entered the Lhasa Plain, the commanders and fighters, regardless of the fatigue of the long march, helped the Tibetan people with the autumn harvest after settling down. After entering Mozhugongka, 140 miles east of Lhasa, a certain unit prepared to rest here for a few days before continuing to advance. This area is a rich agricultural area, and it was the busy autumn harvest season. The Tibetan people were busy harvesting qingke. The commanders and fighters used their rest time to help them with the autumn harvest. The commanders and fighters were all experts in farm work, and they wielded their sharp sickles quickly and cleanly. This was an unprecedented event on the Lhasa Plain, and it immediately caused a sensation throughout the village. Groups of Tibetan men and women ran to see the soldiers harvesting wheat and told each other, "We have never seen such a good army. The Liberation Army helps us harvest wheat so diligently, just like our own family members doing work." The next day, every household sent people to the troop's camp to ask the soldiers to help with the harvest. The soldiers gladly accepted the request of the Tibetan people. They completely forgot the fatigue after the march and were active in the wheat fields in groups, harvesting for the Tibetan people. After harvesting on this side of the river, they went to harvest on the other side; after harvesting for this family, they went to help another family. Although the soldiers and the Tibetan people could not understand each other's language, joyful songs and intense labor had established a close friendship between them.

On the calm and vast Lhasa Plain, a new atmosphere of close unity between the army and the people emerged for the first time. Old ladies and children carried wine and tea, shuttling back and forth in the wheat fields, vying to invite the soldiers to drink, and some even pulled the soldiers to their homes to eat zanba. These warm invitations were all sincerely and politely declined by the commanders and fighters. At dusk, the soldiers lined up in neat rows and sent the bundled wheat to the village.

The troops entering Tibet's strict adherence to discipline and love for the Tibetan people moved every Tibetan in Mozhugongka. They all said, "We must never let Chairman Mao's troops eat zanba with cold water again." Within two days, they gathered more than 200,000 catties of firewood and a large number of potatoes, etc., to support their army. The troops bought them all at a fair price. In this way, the friendship between the commanders and fighters of the troops entering Tibet and the Tibetan people grew deeper and deeper day by day.

    人民解放军某部进抵西藏北部
    班禅行辕堪布会议厅号召后藏僧俗人民欢迎解放军
    进藏部队进军途中和抵拉萨后得到藏民的热烈支援
    【新华社西安二十一日电】黑河消息：根据和平解放西藏办法的协议，由西北向西藏进军的人民解放军某部，经过三千多里的行军，越过青海南部大草原，已在本月四日进抵西藏北部重镇黑河。该部抵达黑河时，曾受到当地西藏地方政府官员及藏民同胞的热烈欢迎。西藏地方政府黑河总督（相当于专员）仁木西（俗官），土丹桑布（僧官）及驻黑河第五代本（相当于团）主官日萨加更率领总督府全体官员、第五代本全体官兵及藏民群众一千余人至市郊列队欢迎，并向该部司令员范明将军、政治委员慕生忠将军献哈达致敬。当雄伟的骑兵行列经过市区时，大街、小巷、各个屋顶以及寺院高大的建筑物上，都挤满了欢迎的人群。人们都穿着节日的盛装，热情地向部队表示欢迎。妇女、儿童都兴奋地招手欢呼，向该部指战员致敬。按：黑河又名纳曲扼，是青海、西藏间交通要冲，西藏北部军事、政治和商业中心。居民约三百户，寺院喇嘛及藏兵约一千五百余人。
    【新华社拉萨二十一日电】班禅行辕堪布会议厅十七日向后藏札什伦布和日喀则的政教官员、僧侣、民众发出通电，号召他们欢迎和支援人民解放军进驻日喀则。电文说：
    “人民解放军入藏部队经过长途跋涉，历经千辛万苦之后，业已胜利地进驻祖国西部重镇拉萨市。堪布会议厅全体人员特向人民解放军入藏部队司令员张国华将军及全体指挥员和战斗员致贺，并号召后藏札什伦布与日喀则的政教官员、僧侣、民众，积极筹备欢迎人民解放军进驻日喀则城的盛大集会。日喀则城的人民应自动供给人民解放军以食粮、马料和蔬菜，并进行公平交易，借给部队需用的一切用具。解放军进入西藏，标志了汉、藏两民族的新的团结，随之而来的将是进行藏族人民的政治、经济、文化等各种建设事业。因之，我们西藏人民应该积极地自动地协助入藏部队，给他们以各种便利与取得密切合作，为彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议而共同奋斗。”
        【新华社拉萨二十一日电】人民解放军进藏部队在向拉萨前进的途中，曾受到藏族人民热烈的支援。在昌都西北和西南间纵横数千里地区的广大藏族农民和牧民，组成了数以千计的牦牛、骡马运输队，往返不停地为部队运送物资。洛隆宗一带的藏胞，把家里能够抽出的马匹都送去参加运输。他们为提高运输效率，还组织了长途接运。昌都西南地区的藏胞，在大雪封山的极端困难环境下，也自动集中了七百头牦牛，把粮食运到大路沿线支援过境的解放军。在运送物资中，藏民们爱护物资甚于爱护自己的身体，遇到大雨大雪，宁让自己受冻，把自用的毡毯盖住粮包。
    解放军沿途所经之处，藏民们很早就为部队预备好了的粮食、菜蔬、柴草和马料。藏胞从很远的牧场、农村和深山里用人背和马驮把物资运到大路沿线。严寒的昌都西北地区，柴草很缺，但藏胞们听说解放军要过境，在一个月前就忙着为部队储存了一百多万斤柴草和干牛粪（作燃料用）。该区丁青宗甲萨村的二十四个青年和壮年用一个月的功夫，替部队预备了十万斤柴草和干牛粪。色渣宗的藏胞怕解放军不习惯烧牛粪，特地冒着风雪从百里外运来木柴。沿途藏胞都提着酥油、干饼、香烟、葡萄干等物品到解放军向拉萨前进的路上去迎送，拱手祈祷大军平安到达拉萨。
    【新华社拉萨二十一日电】拉萨地区藏族人民热烈迎接进驻拉萨的人民解放军。一个多月来，各地藏民已将数万斤糌粑、大米、面粉和大批的菜蔬、柴草、马料卖给解放军进藏先遣部队。西藏地方政府工务局组织了一百多个土木工人为部队修葺营房和马厩。藏民们看到解放军的指挥员和战斗员说话和气、买卖公平，并自己修筑道路和运输柴草等模范行动后，更加拥护和热爱自己的军队。许多藏民赶了几天路程，从遥远的地方用骡马、牦牛、皮船等各种运输工具把大批粮草、菜蔬运到拉萨，卖给解放军。他们并和解放军进藏部队订立预售合同。当张国华将军率领的进藏大军快到拉萨时，为部队制造办公桌、椅子和皮条床的三十二个藏族木工日夜加工赶制，每天比从前多出两、三件成品。农民们踊跃地赶着大批骡马、牦牛，运输粮食和柴草，以迎接大军。在广阔的拉萨平原上，到处可以看到藏民的运输大队在欢乐的歌声中向拉萨络绎不绝地前进。解放军在拉萨平原上
    人民解放军进藏部队在向拉萨进军中，用他们的严格遵守纪律和爱民的模范行动，博得了沿途藏族人民异口同声的赞扬：“毛主席的队伍真好呵！”
    在五十多天的雨季行军中，进藏部队的指挥员和战斗员们忍受着风雪的侵袭，把帐篷架在野外，从没有住过民房和喇嘛寺。每次出发前，他们还将帐篷旁边的排水沟、灶台和厕所等都用土填平。藏族人民在沿途每个驿站都预备了柴草；但指挥员、战斗员们为了减轻藏族人民的负担，常常仍然自己上山打柴。有时他们烧了藏族人民的柴草，也都付给等价的钱币。部队的饲养员们非常爱护藏胞的庄稼。每天宿营后，他们一步不离地看守着牧放的牲口，不让牲口踩踏庄稼。有一次，部队在一个村子驻扎时，牲口踩踏了不到三平方公尺的一小块青稞田，他们马上就到田主家里去道歉，并赔偿了三块银元。全村藏族人民对此都很受感动。
    当进藏部队越过无数雪山冰河进到了拉萨平原时，指挥员、战斗员们不顾长途行军的疲劳，住下后就帮助藏族人民秋收。某部在进驻拉萨以东一百四十里的墨竹工卡后，准备在这里休息几天，再继续前进。这一带是富饶的农业区，这时正是紧张的秋收季节，藏族人民都在忙着收割青稞。指挥员、战斗员们利用休息时间，帮助他们秋收。指挥员、战斗员们都是干庄稼活的能手，他们操着锋利的镰刀割得又快又干净。这在拉萨平原上是一件史无前例的大事，马上轰动了全村。一群群男女藏族人民都跑来看战士们割麦，并互相传告说：“从来没有见过这样好的军队。解放军这样卖力地帮助我们割麦，就跟我们自己家里人做活一样。”第二天，家家都有人到部队宿营地来要求战士去帮助收割。战士们愉快地接受了藏族人民的要求，他们完全忘记了行军后的疲劳，成群地活跃在麦田里，替藏族人民收割。河这边的割完了，他们便到河那边去割；给这一家割完了，又去帮助别一家割。战士们和藏族人民虽然语言不通，但欢乐的歌声和紧张的劳动已使他们之间建立起亲密的情谊。
    沉静宽广的拉萨平原上，第一次出现了这种军民之间亲密团结的新气象。老太太和孩子们提着酒和茶，穿梭似地在麦田里争着请战士们喝，有的还拉着战士们请到家里去吃糌粑。这些热情的招待，都被指挥员、战斗员们诚挚地婉言谢绝了。黄昏时，战士们排着整齐的行列，把已经捆好的麦子送到村里去。
    进藏部队这种严格遵守纪律和热爱藏族人民的行动，感动了墨竹工卡的每个藏族人民。他们都说，我们绝不能再让毛主席的队伍用凉水拌糌粑了。他们在两天内就集中了二十多万斤木柴和大量的马铃薯等，支援自己的军队。部队都一一以公道的价钱买下来。就这样，进藏部队指挥员、战斗员和藏族人民间的友情一天天地愈来愈深厚了。
