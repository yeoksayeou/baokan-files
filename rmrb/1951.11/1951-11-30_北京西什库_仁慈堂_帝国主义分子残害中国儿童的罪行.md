    The imperialist elements of the "Hall of Charity" in Xishiku, Beijing, committed crimes of harming Chinese children

    The "Hall of Charity" in Xishiku, Beijing, was a female orphanage founded by the French Catholic "Daughters of Charity" in 1862 and began receiving American subsidies from 1946. Like other orphanages founded by imperialists in China, it was a criminal institution that ruined Chinese children. According to Lei Shufang, the former French院长 (dean) of the院 (hall), the hall admitted a total of 25,670 children in the eighty-nine years since its establishment, of whom 23,403 died, a mortality rate of 91 percent. This phenomenon did not change after liberation.

    After the liberation of Beijing, the hall still had more than 800 children. Peking University Hospital conducted an examination of the children in the hall and proved that they were all malnourished and developmentally abnormal. Of the 418 children examined, only three met normal standards for height. Generally, children aged fourteen or fifteen were as tall as normal children aged seven or eight. Only eighteen had normal weight. One hundred and seventy-eight were ten kilograms, or even half, underweight compared to normal children.

    The children had to get up at five o'clock every day and could not rest until after seven o'clock in the evening. During the day, they had to "attend Mass," "do their duty" (such as wiping floors), do chores, and recite scriptures.

    The so-called "doing their duty" was actually a kind of hard labor. Many children were crippled by this kind of hard labor. Taking wiping the floor as an example, no matter how cold the winter was, the children still knelt on the tiles outside the door, dipped small pieces of cloth in cold water, and wiped the floor. The children's knees grew thick calluses as hard as bark. The child Wang Yuqin was exhausted in this way. Cui Dayang, Bao Ling, Ma Yuhua, Dai Shuqin and others were all disabled as a result.

    In addition to "doing their duty," there were all kinds of productive labor. The children were forced to pick up heavy hoes that they could not handle to grow vegetables. In winter, they had to go outside the city to collect Chinese cabbage. The cabbage was covered with ice, cutting their arms and causing blood to flow, but no one cared. In the summer, they had to go outside Fuxingmen to pull weeds to feed the ducks. The scorching sun made them breathless, and they worked on an empty stomach from five o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon. Most of the children worked full-time, and when the work was busy, they worked overtime at night. During the Japanese puppet period, they sometimes worked until one or two o'clock in the night. There was a "quota" for the work. If the children could not finish it, they would take it to the toilet to do it, and they would also do it while "relaxing"; if they still could not finish it, they would secretly go to the toilet to process it at night. In this way, the children's labor income accounted for one-third to one-half of the院 (hall)'s income!

    The meals in the院 (hall) were very poor. Even after liberation, the children's food did not exceed half a kilogram of millet per person per day. Infants under one year old were fed skimmed milk water. Children, regardless of their age, were allocated food according to a fixed amount, and many children could not get enough to eat. The院 (hall) never provided boiled water to drink, and many children got sick from drinking raw cold water.

    The children were often subjected to various cruel abuses. The "aunties" (nuns) would inflict various forms of corporal punishment on children who had not completed their work or could not recite the scriptures: slapping, pulling braids, pulling the heads of two children to collide with each other, starving, kneeling, confinement.... Those who were considered to have made "major mistakes" were taken to the changing room, stripped naked, and severely beaten. A child named Ke Niu lost the piece of blue cloth that the "nun" had given her to mend her cuffs. The "nun" refused to let it go, and refused to give her food until she found it back, forcing her to jump into the well. Even sick children were not spared this abuse. A child named Shunli wet the bed while ill. In addition to being beaten and scolded, she was forced to kneel on the cold floor with the wet mattress on her head. Her illness worsened as a result, and she was finally tortured to death. This is the "charity" that imperialist elements in religious clothing gave to Chinese children! The children's sanitary conditions were very bad. The air in the children's院 (hall) was turbid, and the smell of urine was strong. The dining hall and toilet were located in the same place. The children often ate while sitting on chamber pots. Most of the children were covered in lice, and some had itchy heads that were scratched and festered, but the nuns did not treat them.

    Under such hard labor and abuse, and under such poor living conditions, the children's health was severely damaged. According to the inspection by the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, 75.7% of the children in the院 (hall) had head lice, 59.3% were malnourished, 74.6% had trachoma, 57.5% had scabies, and 58.3% suffered from enlarged lymph nodes.

    Under the abuse of the "nuns," the children did not dare to say anything even when they were sick. When they became seriously ill, they often died without treatment. The "nun" in charge of the ward was not responsible at all. Some children were sick and lay on the ground unattended; some fainted on their way to the toilet; some were so thirsty that they could not bear it and got up to find water to drink, only to fall to their deaths on the ground. Imperialist elements like Lei Shufang were harming Chinese children in this way. They even let dogs bite infants to death in the院 (hall).

    Lei Shufang and others not only ruined the bodies of Chinese children in this way, but also poisoned their minds. Under their education, the children did not know their motherland, let alone why they were suffering, and thought that everything was the will of "God." Lei Shufang and others often said to the children: "Everything you eat is from God, suffer for God." When the children died, Lei Shufang and others would say to the living children: "We should be happy for the dead little Marias, because they have now ascended to heaven."

    Imperialists not only use the name of "charity" to cover up their crimes of harming the lives of Chinese children and depriving Chinese children of their labor, but also engage in the crime of trafficking in human beings in the name of "charity." In the past, the "Hall of Charity" would charge sixty silver dollars or five or six shi of corn for each person it sold. Sometimes they used deception to trick the children out. Li Jinhua was tricked into marrying a sixty-year-old man when she was eighteen. Lin Wucai was tricked into marrying an idiot.

    Imperialist elements are harming Chinese children in the name of "charity." What is revealed here is only a part of their crimes. Lei Shufang, the former院长 (dean) of the院 (hall), was afraid of being brought to justice and burned all the archives and documents in order to destroy the evidence.

    北京西什库“仁慈堂”帝国主义分子残害中国儿童的罪行
  　思华
    北京西什库“仁慈堂”是法国天主教“仁爱会”于一八六二年创办的女孤儿院，从一九四六年起接受美国津贴。正同帝国主义者在中国所创办的其他孤儿院一样，它是一个摧残中国儿童的罪恶机关。据该院前任院长法籍修女雷树芳承认，该院自创办以来，八十九年间，入院儿童共二万五千六百七十名，死亡二万三千四百零三名，死亡率竟达百分之九十一。解放以后，这种现象并未改变。
    北京解放以后，该院儿童尚有八百余名。北京大学医院曾对院中的儿童举行了一次检查，证明她们都是营养不良，发育不正常的。在四百十八名受检查的儿童中，体长只有三个合乎正常标准，一般是十四、五岁的孩子，与正常的七、八岁的孩子一样高。体重合标准的只有十八名。有一百七十八名比正常儿童的体重差十公斤甚至差一半。
    儿童们每天五时就得起床，直到夜晚七时以后方得休息。在一天中，她们要“望弥撒”、“做本分”（如擦地板等）、做活计、背诵经文。
    所谓“做本分”其实是一种苦役。许多孩子由于这种苦役变成了残废。就以擦地来说，不管冬天多么冷，儿童们依旧跪在门外磁砖上用小布块蘸凉水擦地。孩子们的膝盖都长了一块树皮一样硬的厚茧。儿童王毓琴就是这样累死的。崔大杨、保灵、马玉华、戴淑琴等都因此成了残废。
    除了“做本分”外，还有各色各样的生产劳役。儿童们被强迫拿起体力所不能胜任的重镢头去种菜。冬天，她们要到城外收白菜。菜上结了冰，划破她们的手臂，血直往外冒，也没有人管。夏天，她们要到复兴门外去拔草喂鸭子，火样的太阳晒得喘不过气来，饿着肚子从早晨五时一直干到午后四时。大部分儿童都是全日劳动，活计忙时晚上加工。在日伪时期有时加工到夜里一、两点钟。活计有“定额”，孩子们做不完，于是上厕所也拿着做，“散心”时也拿着做；再做不完，夜晚偷偷到厕所里去加工。这样，儿童们劳动的收入，竟占了该院收入的三分之一到二分之一！
    院里膳食非常恶劣，就是在解放以后，儿童们的伙食每日每人也没有超过一斤小米。一周岁以下的婴儿，吃的是抽去油的牛奶水。儿童不论大小，一律按定量分配食物，许多孩子都吃不饱。院里从来不给开水喝，许多孩子由于喝生凉水得了病。
    儿童们经常受到各种残酷的虐待。“姑奶奶”（修女）们对没有完成工作或背不出经文的孩子，加以各种体罚：打耳光、拉辫子、拉着两个小孩的头互相碰撞、饿饭、罚跪、禁闭……。被她们认为有“大错”的，便拉到换衣室去，脱光衣服，毒打一顿。有一个叫柯妞的儿童把“姑奶奶”给她补袖口的青布片丢掉了，“姑奶奶”不答应，不给她饭吃，非要她找回来不可，逼得她跳了井。甚至有病的儿童也不能幸免这种虐待。一个名叫顺利的儿童在病中尿了炕，除挨打挨骂之外，还被罚跪在冰冷的地板上顶着尿湿了的褥子，她的病因而加重，终于被折磨死去。这些就是披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子所给与中国儿童的“仁慈”！儿童们的卫生条件很坏。小孩院院内空气混浊，尿臭味很浓，饭厅与厕所设在一处。孩子们经常坐在便桶上吃饭。多数孩子满头满身都生了虱子，有的头痒得抓烂成疮，修女们也不给治。
    在这样苦役与虐待之下，在这样恶劣的生活条件之下，儿童们的健康受到了严重的损害。根据北京市公共卫生局的检查，该院儿童有头虱的占百分之七十五·七，营养不良的占百分之五十九·三，有痧眼的占百分之七十四·六，有疥癣的占百分之五十七·五，患淋巴腺肿大的占百分之五十八·三。
    在“姑奶奶”们虐待下，儿童们有病也不敢说。等到病重了，往往不治而死。管病房的“姑奶奶”根本不负责任，有的儿童病了，卧在地上无人看管；有的在自己爬向厕所的途中昏迷死去；有的病了渴得不能忍了，自己爬起来找水喝，就摔死在地上。帝国主义分子雷树芳之流，就是这样残害着中国的儿童。甚至她们曾经让狗咬死院中的婴孩。
    雷树芳等不但这样摧残着中国儿童的肉体，而且毒害儿童的思想。在她们的教养下，儿童们不知道自己的祖国，更不知道自己为什么受苦，以为一切都是“神主”的意旨。雷树芳等时常对孩子们说：“你们吃的都是天主的，为天主受苦吧。”孩子们死了，雷树芳等就对活着的孩子说：“我们应该为死了的小马利亚们快乐，因为她们现在已经升到天堂去了。”
    帝国主义者不仅以“仁慈”的名义掩盖他们残害中国儿童的生命，剥夺中国儿童劳力的罪恶，而且更以“仁慈”的名义干着贩卖人口的勾当。“仁慈堂”过去每卖一人索现洋六十元或玉米五、六石。有时是用欺骗的办法，把孩子骗出去的。李金花十八岁时，被骗嫁给一位六十岁的老头。蔺武才被骗嫁给一个傻子。
    帝国主义分子就是这样以“慈善”为名，残害中国儿童的。这里所揭发的，只是他们的罪行的一部分。该院前院长雷树芳害怕正义裁判，为了消灭罪证，竟把全部档案和文件都烧毁了。
