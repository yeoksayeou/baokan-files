    The People's Judicial Organs Must Handle Cases According to the Law

    The People's Court of Changping County, Hebei Province, delayed resolving Ren Shuzhen's divorce request for seven months. This not only reflects the extremely serious bureaucratic style of the personnel involved, but also reflects that the personnel involved have no legal concept whatsoever and completely fail to handle cases according to the law. From this point of view, the People's Court of Changping County is almost equivalent to being non-existent.
    It is very tragic that Ren Shuzhen was forced by her parents to marry someone else; however, the president of the People's Court of Changping County and some other staff members had no sympathy for this oppressed woman. When Ren Shuzhen requested a divorce, the reply was: "Newly married couples cannot divorce." According to what law is this? Ren Shuzhen went to the court a second, third, and fourth time, and the answers were all "We'll look into it," and "We'll study it." But they neither looked into it nor studied it, but let Ren Shuzhen make many futile trips back and forth, enduring pain to the point of illness. The fifth time, the "President Ren" replied, "You can get a divorce," but then refused to approve it. What does this mean? What is the legal basis for this? The sixth time, they suddenly demanded to "wait for a summons," and "for the man and woman to come together to resolve it"; but after both the man and woman were summoned to the court, the court ordered them to "go back" and said, "Don't come here again and again." It's as if the court hadn't summoned these two people at all. As a people's court, to deceive the people so wantonly is absolutely not allowed! In recent months, newspapers in various places have published many unfortunate incidents of women committing suicide or being murdered, many of which were caused by the irresponsible attitude taken by the People's Courts or district and village people's governments in some areas. This situation must not be allowed to continue! The People's Court of Changping County and the superior People's Court should immediately thoroughly investigate this case and give the cadres who arbitrarily deceive the people and fail to handle cases according to the law the necessary criticism or punishment.

    人民的司法机关必须按法律办事
    河北省昌平县人民法院对任淑珍提出的离婚要求推延七个月之久，不给解决。这不仅反映了有关人员存在着十分严重的官僚主义作风，而且反映了有关人员是毫无法律观念，完全不按法律办事的。从这一点上来说，昌平县的人民法院几乎等于虚设。
    任淑珍被父母强制着和别人结婚，这是很悲惨的事；但是，昌平县人民法院院长及另外一些工作人员对这个被压迫的妇女毫无同情心。在任淑珍要求离婚时，回答是：“新结婚不可离。”这是根据那条法律？任淑珍第二、第三、第四次到法院，回答都是“了解了解”，“研究研究”。但他们既不去了解，也不去研究，而一任任淑珍多次徒劳往返，忍受痛苦以至生病。到第五次，“姓任的院长”回答说“可以离婚”，但又不予批准，这是什么意思？有什么法律根据？到第六次了，忽然又提出要“等传票”，“男女两人一块来解决”；而男女双方均被传到法院以后，法院却又命令他们“回去”，并说“别一趟一趟来了”。好像法院并未传这两人似的。作为人民的法院而又如此放肆地欺弄人民，这是绝对不能容许的！最近数月，各地报纸都刊载了许多妇女自杀、被杀的不幸事件，其中有不少是因某些地区的人民法院或区村人民政府采取类似这样的不负责任的态度而造成的。这种情形，决不能任其继续下去！昌平县人民法院和上级的人民法院，应该马上彻查这一案件，并给任意欺弄人民、不按法律办事的干部以必要的批评或处分。
