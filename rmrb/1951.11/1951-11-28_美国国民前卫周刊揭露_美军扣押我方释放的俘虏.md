Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 27th: The U.S. "National Guardian" weekly published a dispatch from its Los Angeles reporter on November 14th. The dispatch stated that the mother of an American prisoner of war named Meher is searching for her son, who was released last year by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. She has been searching for a whole year, but without any results.

This missing Meher previously served in the medical team of the 8th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. He was captured near Yunshan on November 2, 1950. On November 20th, he was released along with 26 other prisoners of war. American military reporters interviewed him. Photographers took pictures of him. He was transported by the U.S. military authorities by plane to Osaka, Japan.

Meher's mother first saw her son's photo in a Los Angeles newspaper on November 29, 1950. Unable to obtain official news about her son's safety, she began searching. Although many newspapers published her son's photo, and although some people later personally saw her son in Japan, she has not found her son in the past year.

The "National Guardian" weekly recounted about this matter that during this year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army released many prisoners of war, including the nineteen soldiers of the 1st Marine Division released in July, and the four Filipino soldiers released in August; these nineteen Marine soldiers and four Filipino soldiers are also missing.

Alongside the above-mentioned news, the "National Guardian" weekly published a photo with the caption explaining the scene of a farewell party held by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for American prisoners of war in a certain place in northern Korea before releasing them.

    美国国民前卫周刊揭露
    美军扣押我方释放的俘虏
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】十一月十四日的美国国民前卫周刊上刊载了该刊驻洛杉矶记者写的消息。消息说，一个美国俘虏美赫的母亲寻找她在去年已被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军释放的儿子。她已经寻找了整整一年，但是还没有结果。
    这个失踪的美赫以前是服役于美国骑兵第一师第八团医疗队的。一九五○年十一月二日他在云山附近被俘。十一月二十日，他和其他二十六名俘虏一起被释放。美国军事记者访问过他。摄影记者为他拍了照。他被美军当局用飞机运往日本大阪。
    美赫的母亲在一九五○年十一月二十九日的洛杉矶的报纸上第一次看见她儿子的照片。由于得不到官方关于她儿子的安全的消息，她开始寻找。尽管许多报纸登载了她儿子的照片，尽管有些人后来在日本亲自看见过她的儿子；但是，在过去一年中，她没有找到她的儿子。
    国民前卫周刊就这件事情追述说，在这一年中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军释放了许多俘虏，其中有在七月份释放的海军陆战队第一师的十九名士兵，和在八月份释放的四名菲律宾士兵；这十九名海军陆战队士兵和四名菲律宾士兵也同样下落不明。
    在与上述的消息并排的地方，国民前卫周刊登载了一张照片，照片说明朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在释放美国俘虏以前在朝鲜北部某地为他们举行送别会的情形。
