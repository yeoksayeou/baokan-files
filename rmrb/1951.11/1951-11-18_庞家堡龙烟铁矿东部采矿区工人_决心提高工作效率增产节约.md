　　Workers in the Eastern Mining Area of the Pangjiabao Longyan Iron Mine are Determined to Improve Work Efficiency and Increase Production and Practice Economy
    Editor: The workers of the eastern mining area and the open-pit ore transport department of Pangjiabao Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua City, Chahar Province, are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers with concrete actions. At the employee representative meeting held in the eastern mining area on November 3, representatives of various production teams, combined with their specific situations, put forward plans to increase production and practice economy. For example, the odd-job team decided to save 400 man-days by improving work efficiency, and pay attention to picking up scrap iron and wood at any time; the support team plans to save 2,000 kilograms of millet per person on direct auxiliary materials. The methods are: (1) Each of the three shifts saves 30 hacksaws every day; (2) Use waste pit wood in unimportant places; (3) Repair carbide lamps by themselves when they are broken; (4) No major or minor accidents, and achieve safe production. Other teams have also generally made plans.
    The administrative department of the open-pit ore transport department was initially afraid that the ore surface would freeze in the cold weather, so they allocated six odd-job workers to the day and night shifts of the loading team of the department in order to help them complete the task of stripping the ore surface within a month, starting in late October. However, after discussion by all the workers in the team, everyone unanimously proposed to the administrative department that they would rather work harder and not increase the number of odd-job workers to strip the ore surface. At this time, the odd-job workers had been stripping for ten days, and the remaining twenty days saved the mine one hundred and twenty man-days. Wang Qingyun

　　庞家堡龙烟铁矿东部采矿区工人
    决心提高工作效率增产节约
    编辑同志：察哈尔省宣化市庞家堡龙烟铁矿东部采矿区和坑外运矿部的工人，决定要以具体行动响应毛主席增加生产，厉行节约，支持中国人民志愿军的号召。在十一月三日东部采矿区召开的职工代表会议上，各生产小组代表结合了自己的具体情况，纷纷提出了增产节约的计划。比如杂工组决定以提高工作效率来节省四百个人工，并随时注意捡碎铁、木料；支柱组计划在直接辅助材料上，每人节省二千斤小米，办法是：（一）每天三个班节约三十个扒锯子；（二）废坑木料拆出来用到不重要的地方；（三）电石灯坏了自己修理；（四）不出大小事故，作到安全生产。其他小组也都普遍订出了计划。
    坑外运矿部行政上本来恐怕天冷会把矿面冻了，每天给该部装车组的昼夜两班拨六个杂工，以便从十月下旬开始，帮助他们在一个月内完成扒矿面的任务。但经过全组工人讨论后，大家一致向该部行政上提出宁愿多加一把劲，不用增加杂工扒矿面。这时杂工已经扒了十天，所剩的二十天就给该矿节省了一百二十个人工。  王庆云
