    Pushing the Religious Reform Movement Further

    The Christian and Catholic reform movements for autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation have been widely launched throughout the country. Patriotic believers in various places have exposed the crimes of imperialists using religion for aggression and sabotage, and have participated in various patriotic movements, thus further raising the political consciousness of believers. Many places have established religious reform committees, which have played a certain role in leading the masses of believers in their struggle against imperialist elements and in promoting the reform movement. However, the mass base in most places is not yet deep enough. In addition, in some places, the reform movement is still limited to a few upper-level figures; in others, it is even being used by imperialist elements and reactionaries to carry out fake reforms and false accusations. The reason for this is that in these places, the broad masses of believers have not yet risen up, and the reform movement has not yet become a mass movement of the broad masses of believers. As everyone knows, imperialist elements have carried out a great deal of ideological麻醉work among believers for many years. To completely eliminate the influence of imperialism among believers, it will not work if a enlightenment movement is not launched among believers, if there is a lack of due understanding of the complexity of religious reform work in thought, and if one attempts to act with simple and easy methods.

    Regarding the development of patriotic self-education among religious believers, the article "How Beijing Deeply Mobilized Catholics to Participate in the Reform Movement," published in today's issue of this newspaper, provides some experiences worth learning. These experiences are: (1) Universally organize believers and conduct patriotic education. In learning, it is necessary to deeply study the ideological situation of believers, patiently conduct ideological education, and dispel their ideological concerns. Through the personal experiences of believers and the crimes of imperialist elements and reactionaries that they are familiar with, enlighten believers' patriotic and anti-imperialist awareness. Launch accusation movements, but not for the sake of accusation, but to fully use the materials of the accusation to expose the reactionary features and bad deeds of imperialist elements and their running dogs, and to raise the patriotic and anti-imperialist awareness of believers. (2) The learning process of believers is also a process of fighting against imperialist elements and their running dogs. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the sabotage activities of imperialist elements and their running dogs at all times. While learning, fight against them, and打击 and isolate saboteurs. In the course of continuous struggle, believers will more clearly recognize the true colors of imperialist elements and their running dogs, and more clearly draw a line between the enemy and ourselves in thought. (3) Pay attention to discovering and cultivating activists among believers. Activists are not only an indispensable force in learning and accusation movements, but also prepare the conditions for the establishment of reform committees. Without sufficient activists and close ties with the masses, the reform committee cannot become a powerful organization to lead the masses of believers in their struggle against imperialist elements and to promote the reform movement. (4) When starting to mobilize the masses of believers, efforts should be made to win the cooperation and assistance of people from all walks of life. The religious reform movement is an arduous and complex struggle between patriotic believers and imperialism, and it is also an important part of the current patriotic movement. People from all walks of life and all people's organizations should attach importance to this work and give necessary assistance to patriotic believers.

### 把宗教革新运动推进一步

    把宗教革新运动推进一步
    基督教和天主教自治、自养、自传的革新运动，已在全国范围内广泛开展起来了。各地的爱国教徒们，曾揭发了各种帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略破坏活动的罪行，并参加了各种爱国运动，因而教徒的政治觉悟也更加提高了。很多地方已经成立了宗教革新委员会，在领导教徒群众和帝国主义分子的斗争以及推进革新运动中起了一定的作用。但多数地方群众基础还不够深厚。另外有些地方，革新运动还停留在少数上层分子的圈子里；有的则甚至被帝国主义分子和反动分子所利用，搞假革新、假控诉。其所以如此，是因为在这些地方广大教徒群众还没有起来，革新运动还没有成为广大教徒的群众运动。大家知道，帝国主义分子多年来曾在教徒中间进行了很多思想麻醉工作。要彻底清除帝国主义在教徒中的影响，如果不在教徒中展开一个启蒙运动，如果在思想上对于宗教革新工作的复杂性缺乏应有的认识，而企图用简单省事的办法去行事，那是一定做不通的。
    在开展宗教信徒的爱国主义的自我教育方面，今天本刊发表的“北京市是怎样深入发动天主教徒参加革新运动的”一文，提供了一些值得学习的经验。这些经验是：（一）普遍地把教徒组织起来，进行爱国主义的教育。在学习中，要深入研究教徒的思想情况，耐心地进行思想教育，解除他们的思想顾虑。通过教徒的亲身体验和他们所熟知的帝国主义分子和反动分子的罪行，启发教徒的爱国反帝觉悟。开展控诉运动，但不是为控诉而控诉，而是充分运用控诉的材料，揭露帝国主义分子及其走狗的反动面目和劣迹，提高教徒的爱国反帝觉悟。（二）教徒的学习过程，也是和帝国主义分子及其走狗们进行斗争的过程。因此，必须随时了解帝国主义分子及其走狗的破坏活动。一面学习；一面和他们作斗争，打击和孤立破坏分子。在不断的斗争中，教徒们会更加认清帝国主义分子及其走狗的真面目，更加明确地在思想上划清敌我界线。（三）注意发现和培养教徒中的积极分子。积极分子不但是学习和控诉运动中不可缺少的力量，同时更为革新委员会的成立准备了条件。如果没有足够的积极分子并密切联系群众，革新委员会就不可能成为领导教徒群众和帝国主义分子进行斗争和推进革新运动的有力的组织。（四）在开始发动教徒群众时，应该争取各界人民的配合和帮助。宗教革新运动是爱国教徒和帝国主义所进行的一个艰巨和复杂的斗争，也是目前爱国运动的一个重要内容，各界人民和各人民团体都应该重视这件工作，给爱国的教徒们以必要的帮助。
