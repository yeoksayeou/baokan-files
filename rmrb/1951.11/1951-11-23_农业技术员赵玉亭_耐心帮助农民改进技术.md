Agricultural Technician Zhao Yuting

Patiently Helps Farmers Improve Techniques

Zhao Yuting, a technician at the Agricultural Work Station of Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, has achieved great success in agricultural technology promotion this year. The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry recently issued a special circular commending him.

This spring, Zhao Yuting was sent to Gao Dibaozi Village in the Sanqiao District, the main cotton-producing area of Chang'an County. At that time, governments at all levels in the Northwest were vigorously calling on farmers to select cotton seeds by the kernel, but the cotton farmers in the village believed that their cotton seeds were all of excellent varieties and there was nothing to select. Cotton farmer Zhang Xinfa's wife said to him, "My cotton seeds are good seeds that I saved myself, there's no need to select them." Zhao Yuting then asked her to take out one hundred cotton seeds and select them in public; as a result, he picked out eleven green seeds, four insect-damaged seeds, one black seed, and twenty-nine shriveled seeds. At this time, the cotton farmers were all taken aback and said:

"We didn't expect so many bad seeds in the 'good seeds'! To ensure good seedling emergence, it is safer to select by kernel." Then, Zhao Yuting told them that the selected bad seeds could still be used to extract oil. If they were not selected, and the seedlings emerged unevenly, how much effort would it take to replant an acre? In this way, he persuaded all 112 cotton farmers in the village to select 3,500 jin of cotton seeds by kernel. This year, the cotton seeds selected by kernel in Gao Dibaozi Village had a seedling emergence rate as high as 97 percent.

Zhao Yuting also paid attention to cultivating activists and using their advanced experience to promote work. In early July this year, cotton aphids became widespread in the cotton seedlings in the Sanqiao District. Some cotton farmers sprinkled some poor-quality tobacco leaf water in the cotton fields, but it was ineffective, and they planned to plow the cotton seedlings and replant late autumn crops. At this time, Zhao Yuting helped farmer Fu Zhenmin of Gao Dibaozi Village prepare some tobacco leaf water and cotton oil soap, and guided him to treat half an acre of cotton seedlings. Two days later, new shoots had grown from the cotton stems that had withered in this half acre of cotton field, and the shrunken branches and leaves had re-expanded. In order to promote this method, Zhao Yuting invited the masses of the whole village to visit and demonstrated it to everyone on the spot. Seeing that there was a way to control aphids, the farmers sprayed all 330 mu of cotton fields in the village with tobacco leaf water within three days. Subsequently, Zhao Yuting also invited Mei Zhenxing, the village cadre of Gao Dibaozi Village, to go to various townships to publicize, and mobilized cadres and cotton farmers from various townships to visit Gao Dibaozi Village, quickly igniting a wave of aphid control throughout the district. A week later, the cotton fields throughout the district were treated, and the cotton seedlings all recovered. (Xinhua News Agency)

    耐心帮助农民改进技术
    陕西省长安县农业工作站技术人员赵玉亭，今年在农业技术推广工作方面有很大成绩，最近西北军政委员会农林部特别通报表扬了他。
    今年春天，赵玉亭被派到长安县主要产棉区三桥区高低堡子村工作。当时西北各级人民政府正在大力号召农民粒选棉籽，但该村棉农认为自己的棉籽都是优良品种，没有什么选头。棉农张新法的妻子对他说：“我的棉籽是自己留下的好籽，用不着粒选。”赵玉亭就请她取出一百颗棉籽，当众拣选；结果拣出绿籽十一颗、虫籽四颗、黑籽一颗、秕籽二十九颗。这时候，棉农们才大吃一惊，都说：
    “没有想到‘好籽’中有这么多的坏籽！要想出苗好，还是粒选保险。”接着，赵玉亭又告诉他们，拣出的坏籽还能榨油，要不选，种上苗出不齐，补一亩苗要费多少工夫？这样，他说服了全村一百一十二户棉农，粒选了三千五百斤棉籽。今年高低堡子村粒选出来的棉籽，出苗率高达百分之九十七。
    赵玉亭还注意培养积极分子，用他们的先进经验来推动工作。今年七月初，三桥区的棉苗普遍发生棉蚜，有的棉农在棉地里洒了些不好的烟叶水没有生效，便打算把棉苗犁掉改种晚秋作物。这时，赵玉亭便帮助高低堡子村农民傅振民配制了些烟叶水和棉油皂，指导他治了半亩棉苗。两天后，这半亩棉田里已经枯萎的棉茎就长出了新的嫩芽，萎缩的枝叶重新伸展开来了。为了推广这个方法，赵玉亭邀集全村群众来参观，当场表演给大家看。农民看见治蚜有办法，三天内就把全村的三百三十亩棉田用烟叶水喷了一遍。随后赵玉亭又请高低堡子村村干部梅振兴到各乡去宣传，发动各乡的干部和棉农到高低堡子村来参观，很快就把全区范围内的治蚜热潮鼓动起来了。一周以后，全区的棉田都治了，棉苗都复苏过来了。（新华社）
