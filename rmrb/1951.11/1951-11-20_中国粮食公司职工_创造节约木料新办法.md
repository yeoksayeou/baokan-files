Employees of the China National Grain Corporation
    Devise a New Method for Saving Timber
    In response to the Government Administration Council's directive on saving timber, the China National Grain Corporation has devised a method of using stone strips instead of wooden beams to lay the bottom of open-air warehouse stacks, saving timber and reducing expenses. According to the experience of the Tianjin Municipal Grain Corporation, if wooden beams are used to make the bottom of a warehouse stack storing 120,000 catties of grain, three layers of wooden beams must be laid, using a total of forty-four wooden beams. The unit price of each beam, including freight, is 80,800 yuan, totaling 3,555,200 yuan. If stone strips are used instead of wooden beams to make the bottom of a warehouse stack storing 120,000 catties of grain, two layers are laid, requiring 7.5 cubic meters of stone strips. The unit price of each cubic meter, including freight, is 100,920 yuan, totaling 819,000 yuan. There are two more advantages to using stone strips: first, they are strong and durable, with a low depreciation rate; second, the stone strips used can also be used for the foundations of new warehouses in the future. However, using stone strips entirely cannot achieve the purpose of moisture prevention; it is best to lay two layers of stone strips at the bottom and one layer of wooden beams on top.

### 中国粮食公司职工  创造节约木料新办法

　　中国粮食公司职工
    创造节约木料新办法
    中国粮食公司响应政务院关于节约木材的指示，创造用石条代替楞木铺垫露天仓库囤底的办法，节省了木材，减少了开支。根据天津市粮食公司的经验，如用楞木做储粮十二万斤的仓库的囤底，须铺垫三层楞木，共用楞木四十四根，每根单价连运费为八万零八百元，共合三百五十五万五千二百元。如以石条代替楞木，做储粮十二万斤的仓库的囤底，铺垫两层，需用石条七点五立方公尺，每立方公尺单价连同运费为十万零九千二百元；共合八十一万九千元。使用石条还有两个好处：一、坚固耐用，折旧率小；二、所用石条，将来还可用于新建仓库的墙基。但全部用石条，不能达到防潮的目的，最好下铺两层石条，上垫一层楞木。
