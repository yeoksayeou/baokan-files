Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 9th: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" published an editorial on November 2nd commenting on the recent Korean armistice negotiations, stating: "Even American journalists have had to admit that the Korean and Chinese representatives have made the greatest efforts to seek a ceasefire agreement. The US side is now in a dilemma, and they have exhausted all the tricks they can think of. We will not allow them to evade their responsibility."

"If they sincerely hope to reach an agreement, absolutely nothing can hinder the action to end the bloodshed."

"However, the prospect of a cessation of fighting clearly makes the US State Department and the ruling groups in political, military, and financial circles uneasy. These groups are worried that the conclusion of a Korean armistice agreement will immediately relax the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union. They are worried that this armistice will strengthen the trend of hoping for peace and hoping for American soldiers to return home. They are worried that in this situation, it will be more difficult to get Congress to approve new appropriations."

"L'Humanité" said: Due to these ominous signs, the American ruling groups are desperately trying to prolong the bloody war in Korea. Therefore, peace-loving people should step up the mass movement to strive for peace so that peace in Korea can be realized.

    揭露美国拖延停战谈判原因
    美政府担心停战会松弛扩军准备
    【新华社布拉格九日电】法国“人道报”在十一月二日发表社论，评论最近朝鲜停战谈判的情况称：“甚至连美方记者也不得不承认：朝中代表已经尽了最大的努力来寻求停火协议。美方现在已陷入进退维谷的境地，他们已要尽他们所能够想出的一切花样。我们决不允许他们逃避他们的责任。”
    “如果他们真心希望达成协议的话，绝对没有东西能够阻挠使流血终止的行动。”
    “但是，停止战斗的前景显然使美国国务院和政治、军事、财政界的统治集团感到不安。这些集团担心朝鲜停战协定的缔结，会立即使扩充军备的政策和对侵苏战争的准备松弛下来。他们担心这种停战将加强希望和平、希望美国士兵回国的潮流。他们担心在这种局面下更难使国会通过新的拨款。”
    “人道报”说：由于有这些不祥的朕兆，美国统治集团正在拚命努力延长朝鲜的血腥战争。因此，爱好和平的人民应当加紧发动争取和平的群众运动，以使朝鲜的和平能够实现。
