Further Promote the Production and Sales of North China's Native and Special Products
Zhang Qingzhong

(I) North China Has Abundant Native and Special Products

North China is a region rich in products. The North China region not only produces a large amount of grain and more than 40 percent of the country's cotton but also produces important agricultural economic crops such as hemp, tobacco, and oil crops, and a wide variety of native and special products. These special products include animal products such as pig bristles, cashmere, hides, and egg products that are sold abroad, mountain products such as peach kernels, apricot kernels, black dates, peppercorns, and persimmon cakes, medicinal materials such as licorice root, coltsfoot flower, ephedra, and rhubarb, and fresh goods such as pears, grapes, apples, and Chinese cabbage.

The income from these native and special products accounts for a large proportion of farmers' total income. For example, peppercorns in She County, Hebei Province, account for 25 percent of the county's farmers' total income; black dates in Neihuang County, Pingyuan Province, account for 36 percent of the county's farmers' total income. In 1950, the total income from native and special products in the North China region was more than 7 billion jin of grain, which is equivalent to about one-quarter of the total grain production in North China. Therefore, further strengthening the production and sales of native and special products is of great significance for developing the rural economy and expanding agricultural reproduction.

(II) Native Product Conferences Open Up Sales Channels for Native and Special Products

In order to restore the production of native and special products and find sales channels for them, the North China region launched a mass campaign to promote the sales of native and special products last winter. Provinces, special districts, and counties held a series of native product conferences attended by representatives of state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, experienced private merchants, and relevant departments to discuss and solve the sales problems of native and special products. As a result, cadres paid attention, private merchants became active, the demands of the masses were met, and the sales channels for native and special products were opened up. After Daming County, Hebei Province, held a native product conference, some farmers pulled Chinese cabbage and mung beans to the Fengfeng Mining Area for sale and used the return trip to transport coal, earning 300 jin of sorghum each time. After Puyang County, Pingyuan Province, held a native product conference, many districts and villages signed production and sales contracts. Some people used native products to prepurchase agricultural tools such as plows, drills, harrows, small carts, and waterwheels; some used sweet potatoes to prepurchase cotton cakes, soybean cakes, and other fertilizers; and some used native products to prepurchase bricks and tiles to prepare for well-digging and house construction. After merchants in Hequ County, Shanxi, held a native product symposium, they went to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai to find old business relationships and exchanged medicinal materials for cotton ginning tools. Some went to Baotou, Suiyuan, to find old business relationships, exporting fruits and reed mats in exchange for salt, alkali, and livestock. In addition, many places restored, established, and consolidated temple fairs, horse fairs, and general merchandise fairs, greatly developing mass short-distance exchanges. Due to the widespread development of native product exchanges, according to statistics this spring, more than 70 percent of North China's native and special products were sold last year.

In the movement to promote the sales of native products, there was a tendency to emphasize hot-selling goods over slow-selling goods, large quantities over small quantities, and plains over mountainous areas. Therefore, at the Second North China Native Product Conference in March this year, it was specifically proposed to vigorously find sales channels for slow-selling native and special products. After the meeting, the provinces in North China organized remote sales teams and North China native product visiting groups, which went to East China, Central South, Northeast, and Northwest China to visit local supply and demand situations, promote slow-selling goods, and open up sales channels for many slow-selling products. For example, gypsum from Shanxi and natural alkali from Suiyuan were found sales channels by the native product visiting group and sales teams. By the end of July, the native and special products of North China in 1951 had been basically sold out. The native and special products of 1952, after the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition determined transaction contracts and agreements of more than 10 trillion yuan, can also be sold out.

Promoting the sales of native and special products increased farmers' purchasing power, expanded the market for industrial products, increased national tax revenue, and expanded farmers' reproductive capacity. Therefore, launching a campaign to promote the sales of native and special products is not only satisfactory to farmers but also supported by industrialists and businessmen.

(III) The Future Direction of Developing Native and Special Products

Now, not only have most of North China's native and special products found sales channels, but many native and special products are already in short supply. Not only are bulk native products such as fur and pig bristles selling well everywhere, but also mountain products and fresh goods are in short supply. Peppercorns from Shanxi were 3,800 yuan per jin during the production period last year and were not easy to sell, but this year the price has doubled during the production period but still cannot meet the needs of Tianjin, East China, and Northeast China. Chinese cabbage from Hebei and grapes from Xuanhua, Chahar, also cannot meet the needs of various friendly regions. This shows that the current problem with North China's native and special products is not a problem of slow sales but a problem of how to develop them in a planned way.

So, in what direction should they develop?

First, the development of native and special products should pay attention to the needs of cities and exports. Today, the industrial production of people's cities is constantly developing, and the number of workers is constantly increasing. Therefore, the production of native and special products should not only meet the needs of industrial raw materials but also meet the needs of workers and urban residents' lives. Since China's foreign trade today is mainly with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, in the production of native and special products, all those needed by the Soviet Union and new democratic countries should increase production according to their specifications. This is of great significance for developing China's economic construction, smashing the blockade of American imperialism, and strengthening the economic strength of the peace and democracy camp.

Second, the development of native and special products should pay attention to advocating scientific production methods and promoting the advanced experiences of the masses. For example, the Soviet Union's large white pig breed can produce 600 to 700 jin of meat per year, which is four to five times more than ordinary pig breeds, and should be widely promoted. In terms of native and special products, various production models should be cultivated. For example, there should be models for growing grapes, models for growing fruits, and models for raising pigs. Leadership organs at all levels should give these labor models appropriate spiritual and material rewards.

Third, in order to develop native and special products in mountainous areas, in addition to vigorously improving transportation and organizing sales, special attention should be paid to organizing on-site processing in a planned way. For example, grain can be used to make liquor, potatoes can be used to make flour, oil crops can be used to extract oil, and hemp can be used to make ropes. This can reduce transportation costs, develop sideline businesses, and increase fertilizer. It can also increase the income of farmers in mountainous areas and accelerate the restoration and development of the mountain economy.

Fourth, since the sales channels for native products have been opened up, the production and sales situation has been well understood, and many trade routes have been restored, the promotion of native products should be upgraded from the methods of "traveling around to find relationships" and "holding native product conferences" to a more regular and planned approach. To this end, all localities should strengthen the institutions for promoting native products in a planned way, formulate plans for promoting native products, and specifically organize the promotion of native products. They should also organize private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase native products, consolidate existing commercial networks, and develop new commercial networks. The contract system should be widely promoted to make it an important tool for strengthening the planning of production and sales and reducing blindness. It must be emphasized that contract credit should be strictly observed, and irresponsible behaviors such as blindly signing contracts and arbitrarily tearing up contracts should be opposed.

For a few slow-selling native products such as Scutellaria baicalensis, Astragalus membranaceus, fire nitrate, and skin nitrate, we should continue to actively look for sales channels at home and abroad. In terms of management, we can adopt methods such as "hot-selling goods bringing slow-selling goods," "slow-selling goods exchanging for slow-selling goods, turning both into hot-selling goods," and establishing consignment relationships; and pay attention to processing and packaging, improving quality, and standardizing specifications. For products that are indeed unsalable, farmers should be educated to stop production.

Fifth, the development of native products should be subordinate to agricultural production. We should establish a clear idea that agriculture is the main focus and native products are secondary. We should use sideline businesses to support agriculture, engage in native product production during slack seasons or with surplus agricultural labor, and should not affect agriculture due to the development of native products. In areas where the production of native and special products is the main source of income for the masses, it is necessary and correct to put the production of native products in a primary position.

　　把华北土产特产的产销工作推进一步
     张庆中
    （一）华北有丰富的土产和特产
    华北是一个物产丰饶的地区。华北区不但出产大批粮食，出产占全国百分之四十以上的棉花，出产麻皮、烟叶、油料等重要的农业经济作物，而且也出产种类繁多的土产和特产。这些特产有远销国外的猪鬃、绒毛、皮张、蛋品等畜产，有桃仁、杏仁、乌枣、花椒、柿饼等山货，有甘草、冬花、麻黄、大黄等药材，有水梨、葡萄、苹果、白菜等鲜货。
    这些土产特产品的收入，在农民的总收入中占着很大的比重。如河北涉县的花椒，占该县农民全部收入的百分之二十五；平原省内黄县的乌枣，占该县农民全部收入的百分之三十六。一九五○年华北全区土产特产的收入，总值七十余亿斤粮食，约等于华北粮食总产量的四分之一。因此，进一步加强土产特产的产销，对于发展农村经济，扩大农业再生产，是有重大意义的。
        （二）土产会议打开了土产特产的销路
    为了恢复土产特产的生产，并使其找到销路，华北区去冬曾发动了一个群众性的推销土产特产运动。各省、各专区、各县召开了一系列的包括国营贸易公司、合作社和有经验的私商代表及有关部门的干部参加的土产会议，讨论与解决土产特产的销路问题。这样一来，干部重视了，私商积极了，群众要求得到满足了，土产特产的销路打开了。河北省大名县开过土产会议后，有的农民拉白菜绿豆到峰峰矿区推销，利用回脚贩炭，每次可赚高粱三百斤。平原省濮阳县开了土产会议，很多区与区、村与村订立了产销合同。有人用土产预购犁、耧、耙、小车、水车等农具；有人用红薯预换棉饼、豆饼等肥料；有人用土产预换砖瓦，准备打井盖房。山西河曲县商人开过土产座谈会后，即到天津、青岛、上海找旧的商业关系，以药材换回了弹花工具。有人到绥远包头找旧商业关系，输出果品、苇席，换回盐、碱、牲畜。此外，不少地方恢复、建立和整顿了庙会、骡马大会和百货大会，大大发展了群众性的近距离交流。由于土产交流的广泛开展，据今春统计，去年华北土产特产销出达百分之七十以上。
    推销土产运动中曾经出现重热货、轻冷货，重大宗、轻小宗，重平原、轻山地的偏向。因此，今年三月华北第二次土产会议上，特别提出大力给滞销土产特产品找销路的问题。会后，华北各省即组织远地推销小组及华北土产访问团，分赴华东、中南、东北、西北各地，访问当地供求情况，推销滞销货，为不少滞销品打开了销路。如山西的石膏，绥远的天然碱，就是土产访问团和推销小组找到销路的。到七月底，一九五一年的华北土产特产已基本上推销完毕。一九五二年的土产特产，经过华北区城乡物资交流展览会订定一万亿元以上的交易合同与协议，亦可推销出去。
    推销土产特产，提高了农民购买力，扩大了工业品市场，增加了国家税收，扩大了农民的再生产力。因此，发动推销土产特产运动，不但农民满意，工商业者亦很拥护。
    （三）今后发展土产特产的方向
    现在华北土产特产不但绝大部分找到了销路，而且很多土产特产已经供不应求了。不但大宗土产如皮毛猪鬃到处畅销，就是山货鲜货，也感供不应求了。山西的花椒，去年产期三千八百元一斤，还不易销，今年产期价格上升一倍，但仍不能满足天津、华东及东北的需要。河北的白菜，察哈尔宣化的葡萄，也是满足不了各友区的需要。由此可见，目前华北土产特产已不是滞销问题，而是如何有计划地发展的问题了。
    那末，应该向什么方向发展呢？
    第一，发展土产特产，应注意城市和出口的需要。今天人民城市的工业生产在不断发展，工人在不断增加，因此，土产特产的生产，不仅要满足工业原料的需要，也要满足工人和市民生活的需要。由于今天我国的对外贸易，主要对象是苏联及新民主主义国家，因此，在土产特产的生产方面，凡是苏联及新民主主义国家所需要的，都应根据其规格，增加生产。这对于发展我国的经济建设，粉碎美帝国主义的封锁，加强和平民主阵营的经济力量，都有重要的意义。
    第二，发展土产特产，应该注意提倡科学的生产方法，推广群众的先进经验。如苏联的大白猪种，每只每年可产肉六、七百斤，比普通猪种多产四、五倍，就应广为提倡。在土产特产方面，应该培养各种各样的生产模范，例如，种葡萄的应有种葡萄的模范，种水果的应有种水果的模范，养猪的应有养猪的模范。各级领导机关，应该给这些劳动模范以适当的精神奖励和物质奖励。
    第三，为发展山区土产特产，除大力改善交通和组织运销外，应特别注意有计划地组织就地加工。例如粮食可以烧酒，马铃薯可以制粉，油料作物可以榨油，麻可合绳，等等。这样既可减轻运输成本，又可发展副业，增加肥料。并可使山地农民增加收入，加速山地经济的恢复与发展。
    第四，由于土产销路已经打开，产销情况已有相当了解，许多贸易路线已经恢复，因此，推销土产应从“周游列国找关系”和“召开土产会议”的方式提高一步，即要有步骤地走向经常化和计划化。为此，各地应有计划地加强推销土产的机构，制订土产推销计划，具体组织土产推销。并组织私商下乡收购土产，巩固已有的商业网和发展新的商业网。广泛推广合同制，使之成为加强产销计划性、减少盲目性的重要工具。必须强调严守合同信用，反对盲目地乱订合同、随意撕毁合同等不负责的行为。
    对少数滞销土产如黄芩、黄芪、火硝、皮硝等，应继续积极地向国内外找销路。在经营上可采用“热货带冷货”，“冷货换冷货，两头变热货”和建立代销关系等方式；并注意加工整装，提高品质，划一规格。对确无销路的产品，应教育农民停止生产。
    第五，发展土产，应服从农业生产。应当树立明确的农业为主、土产为副的思想。应以副业养农业，在农闲或在平时以农业剩余劳动力从事土产生产，而不应因发展土产而影响农业。在以土产、特产生产为群众主要收入的地区，把土产生产提到首要的地位，则是必要和正确的。
