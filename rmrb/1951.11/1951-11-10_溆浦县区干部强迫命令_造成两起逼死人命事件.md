    Xupu County District Cadres' Coercive Orders Cause Two Deaths

    To the Editor: Recently, two incidents of farmers being driven to suicide occurred in Xupu County, Hunan Province, during the collection of public grain. According to preliminary information, the course of events is as follows: Qu Mingde, a farmers' association cadre in the Sixth District of Xupu County, reduced the number of mu of land reported by the farmers' association group leader. District cadre Tao Dechao punished him by making him kneel for four hours and slapped him in the face. Qu Mingde hanged himself on September 29th. Shu Dayue, a farmer in the Second District, reported that a member of the evaluation committee, Yang, possessed undeclared land. Yang said that Shu Dayue was making a false accusation out of spite. District cadre He Kai believed Yang's words and detained Shu Dayue for one night. Shu Dayue committed suicide on October 11th. Although the detailed facts still require further investigation, the incidents themselves are undoubtedly very serious. I believe that the serious commandism of some local cadres must be thoroughly corrected. I hope that the local government will promptly investigate and handle the above-mentioned incidents according to the law. I also hope that these incidents will raise the vigilance of all parts of the country and strictly prohibit the bad practice of commandism in grain collection and other work.

    Editor's Note: The deaths that occurred in Xupu County, Hunan Province, during the grain collection work illustrate that commandism will inevitably lead to harmful consequences for the people. We hope that the Xupu County People's Government will seriously handle these incidents and announce the results of the handling.

    溆浦县区干部强迫命令
    造成两起逼死人命事件
    编辑同志：最近湖南省溆浦县征收公粮中发生两起农民被逼自杀事件。据初步材料，事情的经过是这样：溆浦县六区农会干部瞿明德经手把农会小组长的田亩数改少后，被区干部陶德超罚跪四个钟头，并打了一记耳光。瞿明德于九月二十九日上吊自杀。二区农民舒达岳，告发评议委员杨某有黑田，杨说舒达岳是挟嫌诬告。区干部贺凯听信杨的话，把舒达岳扣押一晚。舒达岳于十月十一日自杀。现在事实详情虽尚待进一步的调查，但事件本身无疑是非常严重的。我认为，对某些地方干部严重的强迫命令作风，必须加以彻底纠正。希望当地政府对上述事件迅速检查依法处理。并希望这些事件能引起全国各地的警惕，严禁征粮和其他工作中强迫命令的恶劣作风。    张浩然
    编者按：湖南省溆浦县在征粮工作中发生的人命事件，说明强迫命令作风必然会造成危害人民的恶果。希望溆浦县人民政府严肃处理这些事件，并公布处理结果。
