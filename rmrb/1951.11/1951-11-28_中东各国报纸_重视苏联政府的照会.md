Xinhua News Agency, 27th. Middle Eastern newspapers have prominently published the Soviet government's note to the governments of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Israel regarding the US, UK, France, and Turkey's proposal to establish a so-called Middle East Command. Several newspapers have also published editorials on this matter.

    The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram" published a TASS statement regarding the Soviet government's note to Egypt under the headline: "The Soviet Union Attaches Great Importance to Egypt's Attitude Towards the Four-Power Proposal."

    The Syrian newspaper "Al-Baath" headline emphasized that the Soviet Union believes that participating in this so-called "joint defense plan" is "an act of aggression against the Soviet Union."

    The Israeli newspaper "Haaretz" commented: "The Israeli Foreign Ministry has adopted a completely silent attitude towards the Soviet note." The editorial in "HaMishmar" stated: "The Israeli government has put out the word that it does not intend to respond to the Soviet note. But public opinion will demand a clear answer from the government. The masses will also give their answer... Do not let Sharett and Ben-Gurion deceive the people into thinking that they can participate in the plan to attack the Soviet Union without affecting Israel's relations with the Soviet Union. Participating in the anti-Soviet aggressive command will worsen Israeli-Soviet relations."

    The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Youm" headline read: "The participation of Arab countries in the joint defense plan will cause great damage to relations between the Arab world and the Soviet Union. The realization of the plan to establish a Middle East Command will actually mean the military occupation of the Middle East region." The "Al-Kull-Shai" headline was "Joint Defense Plan Means Losing Independence." The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Telegraph" published an editorial stating: "Arabs should regard the Soviet note as a guarantee of peace in the Middle East. The Soviet note provides new evidence that Moscow is striving for friendly cooperation with the Arab peoples. ... We accept and sincerely support the guarantees put forward in the Soviet note." "Al-Shark" commented: The important point in the Soviet note is that the Soviet government has once again announced that the Soviet Union supports the just national demands of the Arab peoples. The Tripoli-based "As-Sarkha" wrote in an article entitled "Joint Aggression": "The plan to establish a 'joint defense' system (which we call a 'joint aggression' plan), like all other imperialist plans, aims to strengthen imperialist rule in the Middle East. The reason why this plan has been delayed is due to the contradictions between the imperialist countries. However, the main obstacle to this plan is the resistance and great victory of peace-loving people all over the world, led by the Soviet Union under Stalin. The plan to establish a 'joint defense' system is a continuation of the aggressive plan of American imperialism and its vassal states. The purpose of this plan is to launch a war against the Soviet Union, China, the People's Democracies, and all freedom-loving peoples." The newspaper further pointed out: "In all Arab countries, thousands upon thousands of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other honest men and women are all shouting to the imperialists, 'Get out of our land! Take back your hands stained with the blood of the victims of North Africa, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Transjordan, and Alexandria!'"

### 中东各国报纸  重视苏联政府的照会

    中东各国报纸
    重视苏联政府的照会
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社消息：中东各国报纸都以重要地位刊出苏联政府就美、英、法、土四国建议设立所谓中东司令部一事致埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、也门和以色列各国政府的照会。若干报纸并为此发表社论。
    埃及“金字塔报”以大标题登载了塔斯社关于苏联政府致埃及照会的声明，标题是：“苏联极其重视埃及对四国建议所持的态度”。
    叙利亚“创造报”的标题强调指出，苏联认为参加这种所谓“联防计划”就是“反对苏联的一种侵略行动”。
    以色列“哈尔兹报”在评论中指出：“以色列外交部对于苏联照会采取完全缄默的态度。”“哈米斯马尔报”的社论说：“以色列政府已放出空气说，政府不拟答复苏联的照会。但是舆论将要求政府给以明确的答复。人民群众也会给以他们的答复……。不要让沙赖特和本·古里安欺骗人民说，既可以参加进攻苏联的计划又可以不影响以色列和苏联的关系。参加反苏的侵略司令部将会使以苏关系恶化。”
    黎巴嫩“阿尔·约姆报”的标题是“阿拉伯国家参加联合防御计划将使阿拉伯和苏联之间的关系蒙受巨大的损失。建立中东司令部计划之实现实际上将意味着中东地区受到军事占领”。“喀尔·夏报”的标题是“联防计划意味着失去独立”。黎巴嫩“电讯报”发表社论说：“阿拉伯人应该认为苏联的照会是中东和平的保证。苏联照会提供了新的证据，证明莫斯科是努力争取与阿拉伯各国人民的友好合作的。……我们接受并热诚地拥护苏联照会中提出的保证。”“东方报”在评论中说：苏联照会中重要的地方是，苏联政府再度宣布，苏联支持阿拉伯各国人民的正义的民族要求。的黎波里出版的“阿斯萨尔哈报”在一篇题为“联合侵略”的论文中写道：“建立‘联合防御’体系计划（我们把它叫作‘联合侵略’计划），像帝国主义者的其他所有计划一样，目的是加强帝国主义在中东的统治。这个计划迟迟不得实行是由于帝国主义国家之间的矛盾。然而，这个计划的主要障碍却是以斯大林领导下的苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民的抵抗和伟大胜利。建立‘联合防御’体系的计划是美帝国主义和它的附庸国家阵营的侵略计划的继续。这个计划的目的是对苏联、中国、人民民主国家和所有爱好自由的各国人民发动战争。”该报进一步指出：“在所有的阿拉伯国家里面，成千成万的工人、农民、知识分子和其他正直的男子和妇女一齐对帝国主义者高呼‘滚出我们的国土！缩回你们的沾满北非、埃及、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、巴勒斯坦、外约旦和亚历山大勒达的牺牲者的鲜血的双手罢！’”
