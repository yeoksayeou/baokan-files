Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch -- According to a dispatch from the Electric News Agency in London: The advanced section of the British working class is determined to wage a resolute struggle against the Conservative government.

　　On October 28th, Scottish miners and London machinists, at two rallies, issued serious warnings to the newly-installed Conservative government. At a miners' rally in Glasgow, Scottish miners' leader Moffat said, "If the Conservative Party implements policies against the miners as they did after the First World War, then we can say for certain that the miners will definitely fight back." His words were greeted with thunderous cheers from the audience. At a celebration in London commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, seven thousand machinists enthusiastically cheered the militant speech of Brassington, chairman of the powerful Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. He said, "If the Conservative government thinks it can attack the standard of living, then the situation created by the trade union movement in the country will force it to reconsider."

　　On the same evening, the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, delivered a speech at a conference in Hove, southern England. He pointed out that the fighting spirit of the British working class had been demonstrated in this election. He said, "Many Labour Party workers in factories and mines, together with Communists, have carried out activities against the Conservatives, with a spirit and enthusiasm not seen for a long time." Pollitt emphasized that the Conservative government will intensify its war plans and attack the living standards of the working class, so workers must fight it tooth and nail. He further pointed out, "From this election, it can be seen that it is not possible to rely on right-wing leaders to lead this struggle." Pollitt finally assured that the Communists would unite with all workers in every way to defeat the Conservative Party's plans, force it to announce a new election, establish a government that supports peace, and strengthen the movement to strive for peace and collect signatures for the declaration of the Five-Power Peace Pact.

　　英国工人在两处集会上
　  严重警告邱吉尔政府
　  波立特号召工人阶级团结斗争
    【新华社一日讯】据电通社伦敦消息：英国工人阶级的先进部分决心对保守党政府进行坚决斗争。
    十月二十八日，苏格兰矿工和伦敦机器工人在两处集会上，对新上台的保守党政府提出了严重警告。在格拉斯哥举行的矿工集会上，苏格兰矿工领袖莫法特发言说：“假如保守党像他们在第一次世界大战之后那样，实行反对矿工的政策，那么我们可以确定地说，矿工必定要给它还击。”他的这些话博得了轰动全场的欢呼。在伦敦举行的庆祝混合机器工会成立一百周年纪念会上，七千名到会的机器工人热烈欢呼庞大的造船与机器工会联合会主席布拉塞尔顿战斗性的演说。他说：“假如保守党政府以为它能够对生活水准进攻，那么工会运动在国内所造成的形势，将要迫使它重新考虑一下。”
    同一天晚间，英国共产党总书记波立特在英格兰南部荷夫举行的大会上发表演说。他指出：英国工人阶级的战斗精神已在这次选举中表现出来，他说：“许多工厂和矿坑中的工党工人，和共产党人一起进行反对保守党的活动，那种精神和热情是很久以来没有见过的。”波立特着重说：保守党政府将加紧进行战争计划，并进攻工人阶级的生活水准，因此，工人们必须寸土必争地去和它斗争。他进一步指出：“从这次选举可以看出，依靠右翼领袖们，让他们来领导这个斗争，是不行的。”波立特最后保证共产党人一定以一切方法和所有工人团结一致，以打败保守党的计划，迫使它宣布重新举行选举，成立拥护和平的政府，同时并加强争取和平和征集缔结五大国和平公约宣言的签名运动。
