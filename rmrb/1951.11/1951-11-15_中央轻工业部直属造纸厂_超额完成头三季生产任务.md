Paper Mills Directly Under the Central Ministry of Light Industry
    Exceed Production Targets for the First Three Quarters

The state-owned paper mills directly under the Central Ministry of Light Industry have exceeded their production plans for various types of paper by 10% for the first three quarters of this year. It is estimated that the total paper production of these factories this year will increase by approximately 34% compared to 1950. This situation indicates that the labor productivity of the factories has greatly improved compared to last year. According to statistics from the Paper Industry Administration of the Ministry of Light Industry, the average labor productivity of the directly subordinate factories from January to August this year increased by approximately 20.74% compared to the same period last year.

The main reasons for the factories' increased labor productivity are the full utilization of equipment production capacity and improvements in production technology. For example, the machine speed (the length of paper produced per minute) of the paper machines in various factories increased by an average of 7.75% from January to September this year compared to the same period last year. During the same period, the average paper loss rate decreased by 0.3%. The production capacity of the cooking equipment in the Tianjin Paper Mill, Taiyuan Paper Mill, and Xuanhua Paper Mill has also increased. The cooking capacity of each boiler in the aforementioned factories (i.e., the amount of raw material cooked per hour per cubic meter of volume) increased by 10% to 38% respectively.

　　中央轻工业部直属造纸厂
    超额完成头三季生产任务
    中央人民政府轻工业部直属的各国营造纸厂已超额百分之十完成了今年头三季各种纸张的生产计划。预计各厂今年纸张总产量可比一九五○年提高约百分之三十四。这种情况，说明各厂的劳动生产效率已较去年大为提高。据轻工业部造纸工业管理处统计，各直属厂今年一至八月的劳动生产效率平均比去年同期约提高百分之二十点七四。
    各厂提高劳动生产效率的主要原因是发挥了设备生产能力，改进了生产技术。如各厂造纸机的抄速（每分钟机器抄纸长度），今年一至九月平均比去年同期提高了百分之七点七五；同期的损纸率平均降低了百分之零点三。天津造纸总厂、太原造纸厂和宣化造纸厂的蒸煮设备的生产能力也有提高。上述各厂各锅炉的蒸煮能力（即每小时每一立方公尺容积蒸煮原料的数量）分别提高了百分之十至百分之三十八。（新华社）
