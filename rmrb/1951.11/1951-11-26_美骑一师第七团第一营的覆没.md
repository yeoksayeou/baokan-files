    The Annihilation of the First Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lu Yun
    During Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," the main force regiment of the U.S. invading army's 1st Cavalry Division—the 7th Regiment—suffered continuous and heavy blows in the area northwest of Yeoncheon, east of the Imjin River. The most tragic defeat was that of the regiment's First Battalion. Since September 6th, this battalion had been struggling to fight while being continuously replenished and annihilated. On the nights of November 4th and 5th, when the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a powerful counterattack near Jeongdong, five kilometers northwest of Yeoncheon, all of the battalion's more than 1,400 officers and soldiers were wiped out, except for the battalion commander, who escaped by chance with twenty or thirty staff officers and support personnel from the battalion headquarters. In this battle, many units of a certain volunteer force were awarded honorary titles for their outstanding achievements, and many heroic commanders and fighters received "military merit medals."
    At dawn on November 4th, the soldiers of a certain volunteer unit had already reached the vicinity of Jeongdong, only five hundred meters from the small hill occupied by the enemy. In the morning light, the assault team members quietly approached the edge of the small hill, carefully observing the path of attack and the breakthrough point.
    The enemy, entrenched on the hilltop, feared the Volunteer Army's counterattack and had been rushing to build defenses day and night. Trenches and foxholes dotted the hilltop, and the fortifications were surrounded by layers of barbed wire, with minefields and explosives laid outside the barbed wire. However, the Volunteer Army's artillery had already targeted these enemy defenses and supporting fortifications.
    Not long after dark on the same day, many of the Volunteer Army's cannons roared in unison. With the valley-shaking sound of artillery fire, the enemy's bunkers were blown up one after another, the barbed wire was thrown into the sky, and the minefields and explosives were detonated by the dense artillery shells. Infantry warriors quickly launched an attack on the path of attack opened up by the artillery fire. As the artillery fire extended its range, the assault team had already rushed to the top of the hill. Enemy soldiers who had survived the artillery fire and stubbornly resisted with their guns were immediately shot dead by the assault team members armed with submachine guns. Beside the collapsed bunkers, some soldiers who had not been killed but were frightened were taken prisoner. In just about twenty minutes of fighting, all of the enemy's First Battalion's Second Company and most of the Weapons Company, a total of more than 400 people, were either killed or captured, except for more than twenty people who were captured alive.
    The next day, the enemy concentrated a large number of artillery units and aircraft to fiercely bombard this position, firing more than 20,000 shells from morning to noon. But this was a waste, because the Volunteer Army soldiers, before the enemy's shelling began, had escorted the prisoners and carried the captured weapons to another nearby hilltop. The enemy's shelling continued into the afternoon, and only then did other units of the U.S. Cavalry Division's First Battalion climb back up to this empty high ground with trepidation. They immediately rushed to repair the fortifications damaged by our army and their own artillery fire. At night, they were exhausted, but were forced to engage in another fierce battle; because at this time the Volunteer Army attacked them again. Under the cover of fierce artillery fire, the Volunteer Army's assault team, like a sharp knife, plunged straight into the enemy's position. Volunteer Army squad leader Sun Keming led eight soldiers, rushing to the front like a gust of wind. Enemy bullets were pouring down on them like water. Sun Keming suddenly went weak in the legs and fell down, but he immediately stood up stubbornly and led his soldiers to the top of the hill in one breath. At this time, nine enemies suddenly jumped out of the opposite fortification and counterattacked them. Machine gunner Dong Liheng held his light machine gun and rushed straight up, shooting as he ran, knocking down all nine enemies. The remaining enemies ran away as if they were a scattered pack of wolves. After the Volunteer Army assault team members occupied the hilltop, they immediately pursued the fleeing enemies. At this time, another Volunteer Army unit detoured from the side, cutting off the enemy's escape route and compressing the disorganized enemy into a small area at the foot of the hill. This created a scene of fighting the enemy on two fronts.
    The trapped enemy still wanted to stubbornly resist. Volunteer Army company commander Fang Kuili led a platoon to repeatedly charge and kill the enemy. Soldier Wang Zhenfang was wounded in the chest, but still used hand grenades to kill more than 20 enemies. Automatic rifleman Long Tianfa rushed into the enemy ranks alone, and after sweeping more than ten enemies to death with his submachine gun, five enemies rushed towards him from the left. He immediately skillfully dodged the machine gun bullets fired at him, pounced on the enemy from the side, and knocked down three in a row. The remaining two enemies then surrendered.
    While the battle was raging, the enemy sent a company of troops to reinforce, but they were driven back halfway. At that time, the Volunteer Army soldiers ambushed at the foot of the hillside waited for this reinforcing enemy to rush into the firing range, and then fired all kinds of weapons together, killing or wounding more than 100 enemies. The soldiers called this "extra income."
    The First Battalion of the main force regiment of the U.S. Cavalry Division was completely annihilated under the heavy blows of the Volunteer Army's warriors. According to Second Lieutenant Clopena, the platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Second Company of the battalion, who was captured on the night of the 5th, the Second Company was completely annihilated in the first night of fighting. The next day, the battalion replenished a company from the rear, restoring the Second Company's organization, but it was annihilated along with the entire battalion that night, with no one escaping. Clopena himself had only been replenished to the Second Company during the day. He said dejectedly: "Many new recruits who had just been replenished from the country were killed or captured without even firing a shot."

    美骑一师第七团第一营的覆没
    新华社记者　路云
    在范佛里特的“秋季攻势”中，美国侵略军骑兵第一师的主力团——第七团，在临津江以东涟川西北地区不断地遭到沉重的打击，而失败得最悲惨的要算是该团的第一营了。这个营自从九月六日起，就在不断补充不断被歼的情况下勉强作战。到十一月四、五两日的夜间，当中国人民志愿军向涟川西北五公里正洞附近发起强大反击时，该营除了营长带着营部二、三十个参谋和勤杂人员侥幸漏网外，其余一千四百余名官兵被全部歼灭。在这一战斗中，志愿军某部的许多单位因战功卓著而获得荣誉称号，许多英雄指挥员战斗员得到了“军功章”。
    十一月四日黎明，志愿军某部战士们已经进抵正洞附近。这里距敌人据守的小山岗只有五百公尺。在晨光下，突击队员们悄悄地接近到小山岗的边缘处，仔细地观察冲锋道路和突破口。
    据守在山头上的敌人惧怕志愿军的反击，连日来不分昼夜地赶修防御工事。交通沟和散兵坑密布山头，在堡垒的四周，环绕着层层的铁丝网，铁丝网的外面又布设了地雷阵和爆炸物。但是，志愿军的大炮早已对准了敌人的这些防御工事和副防御工事。
    当天天黑不久，志愿军的许多门大炮就一齐轰鸣起来。随着震撼山谷的炮声，敌人的地堡先后被炸塌，铁丝网被抛向天空，地雷阵和爆炸物也被密集的炮弹炸响了。步兵勇士们在炮火开辟出来的冲锋道路上迅速地发起冲锋。当炮火伸延射击时，突击队正好已冲上了山顶。在炮火中侥幸逃命而持枪上前顽抗的敌人，立刻又被手持冲锋枪的突击队员打死。在倒塌的地堡旁，有的没有被打死的但已吓昏了的士兵就当了俘虏。仅约二十分钟的战斗，敌军第一营第二连的全部和火器连的大部共四百多人，除了二十多个人被活捉外，其余的都被打死了。
    第二天，敌人集中了大量的炮队和飞机向着这个阵地猛烈轰击，从早上到中午就放射了二万多发炮弹。但这是白白地浪费了，因为志愿军的战士们在敌人炮击开始之前，就押着俘虏背着缴获的武器转移到附近的另一处山头去了。敌军的炮击一直继续到下午，美骑兵师第一营的另外一些部队才心惊胆战地重新爬上了这座空无一人的高地。他们立即抢修被我军和他们自己炮火所打坏了的工事。入夜，他们已经疲乏不堪，但是又被迫投入了另一次剧烈的战斗；因为这时志愿军又向他们攻击了。在猛烈炮火掩护下，志愿军的突击队像一把尖刀，直插进敌人的阵地。志愿军班长孙克明率领着八个战士一阵风似地冲在最前面。敌人的子弹泼水似地从对面向他们射来。孙克明忽然两腿一软倒了下去，但他立即顽强地又站了起来，带着战士一口气冲上了山头。这时，对面工事里突然跳出九个敌人向他们反击过来。机枪手董利恒端着轻机枪直迎上去，一边跑一边射击，把这九个敌人全部打倒了。其余的敌人就像打乱了的狼群一样，回头就跑。志愿军的突击队员们占领山顶后，立即对溃逃的敌人跟踪追击。这时，另一支志愿军部队从侧面迂回，切断了敌人的逃路，将溃乱的敌人压缩在山底下一片狭小的地段上。这便出现了一个两面夹击敌人的战斗场面。
    被困的敌人还想进行顽抗。志愿军连长方奎利率领一个排与敌进行反复的冲杀。战士王振方胸部负了伤，还用手榴弹炸死了二十多个敌人。自动枪手龙天发只身冲进敌阵，端着冲锋枪一气扫死了十多个敌人之后，有五个敌人从左侧向他冲来。他立即敏捷地闪开了迎面射来的机枪子弹，从侧面扑向敌人，一连击倒了三个。剩下的两个敌人便举手投降了。
    当战斗正在激烈进行时，敌人曾派出一个连的兵力前来增援，但在半路就被打了回去。当时埋伏在山坡下的志愿军战士们等这股增援的敌人闯进火力圈时，各种火器一齐发射，又杀伤敌人一百多名。战士们把这叫做“额外收入”。
    美军骑兵第一师主力团第一营就在志愿军勇士们的惨重打击下全部覆灭了。据在五日夜间被俘的该营第二连第二排中尉排长克洛彭那说：二连在第一夜的战斗中就全部被歼。第二天营里又从后方补充到一个连，恢复了二连的建制，但在当晚又和全营一起被歼，无一漏网。克洛彭那自己就是白天才补充到二连的。他垂头丧气地说：“有许多刚从国内补充来的新兵，连一枪也未放就被打死或当了俘虏。”
