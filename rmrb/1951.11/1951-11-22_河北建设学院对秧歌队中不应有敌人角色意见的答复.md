    Hebei Construction Institute's Reply Regarding the Opinion that There Should Be No Enemy Characters in Yangge Dance Team
    To the Editor: We sincerely accept the opinion raised by Comrade Zhang Zengshou in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on November 6th. It was inappropriate for us to allow characters playing enemies to participate in the National Day celebration ceremony with the team. This mistake has already produced a negative impact among the people. This is a result of our insufficient political study. We will definitely pay attention to correcting this in the future so that this type of error does not happen again.

    河北建设学院对秧歌队中不应有敌人角色意见的答复
    编辑同志：十一月六日人民日报“读者来信”栏内所载张增寿同志对我们所提的意见，我们诚恳地接受。我们让扮演敌人的角色随队参加庆祝国庆的仪式，是不妥当的。这种错误并已在人民群众中产生不良影响，这是我们政治学习不够的结果，今后一定注意改正，使这类错误不再发生。
                                         河北省建设学院
