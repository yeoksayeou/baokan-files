    Our "Hometown Introduction Meeting" and "Traveler Group"
    Harbin Jingwei Elementary School Zhang Zhaoying Sun Jiuquan
    Our students at Harbin Jingwei Elementary School have made good use of extracurricular activities to cultivate their patriotic ideas. These extracurricular activities are closely linked to classroom learning. After our fifth grade finished the language lesson "A Devil," it aroused the whole class's hatred of American imperialism. At this time, we held a "Hometown Introduction Meeting" on the Young Pioneers team day to inspire everyone's love for their hometown and motherland, and hatred for American imperialism that destroys the security of our motherland. The world of children's activities is their homes, schools, mountains, fields and rivers near their hometowns. They have a very natural feeling for these things in their hometown. Before the meeting, the teachers also helped some children make certain preparations. At this interesting "Hometown Introduction Meeting," the children introduced the beautiful scenery, large factories, and fertile fields of Harbin, Shenyang, Chongqing and other places they were familiar with. For example, student Xu Jialing introduced: "I grew up by the beautiful Jialing River, and there is a large bamboo forest next to my house. The large ships on the river are full of oranges and sugar..." Li Naijiang introduced the situation of his hometown, Huang County, Shandong, saying: "It is really a good place. To the north is the Bohai Sea, and to the south is an endless plain. In May and June, you can see golden wheat waves on one side and the blue sea on the other." These introductions aroused the children's infinite love for the motherland. Some said: "We have such a beautiful country, we must not let the American devils destroy it."
    The fifth-grade students also organized a "Traveler Group" in conjunction with the study of geography. Their "travel" was conducted indoors. The destination of their first trip was the capital of the motherland - Beijing. The teacher helped the students draw a map of the capital and the surrounding areas in advance, and collected hundreds of color pictures of the capital and surrounding cities. These pictures allowed everyone to see the capital's famous historical sites, the great Tiananmen Square, and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. When the students saw the glittering, majestic, and exquisitely crafted ancient architectural images, they all admired the great creativity of our ancestors. When everyone heard that a large number of precious antiquities collected in the Palace Museum were stolen and sold to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek, they felt great anger in their hearts. The teacher also used storytelling to tell everyone about the past feudal emperors ruling the people and the eight imperialist powers jointly invading Beijing and burning the Yuanmingyuan. They introduced the historically famous "May Fourth" and "December 9th" revolutionary movements. They explained the great significance of Chairman Mao Zedong's announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China at Tiananmen on October 1, 1949. At the same time, the teacher also read some articles and poems describing and praising the people's capital. This classroom trip left a deep impression on the students. Everyone felt proud of the glory and greatness of the motherland; they hated the brutality and shamelessness of imperialism and feudalism.

    我们的“家乡介绍会”和“旅行家小组”
    哈尔滨经纬小学  张兆英  孙九权
    我们哈尔滨经纬小学的同学，利用课外活动很好地培养了自己的爱国主义思想。这些课外活动是紧紧结合着课堂学习进行的。我校五年级讲完国语课
    “一个恶魔”之后，激起了全班同学仇恨美帝国主义的情绪。这时，我们在少年儿童队日开了一个“家乡介绍会”，启发大家对故乡和祖国的热爱，和对破坏祖国安全的美帝国主义的仇恨。儿童们活动的世界就是他们的住屋、学校、家乡附近的山川和田野。他们对故乡的这些事物都有一种极自然的感情。在开会之前，教师们还帮助某些儿童作了一定的准备。在这个富有情趣的“家乡介绍会”上，孩子们介绍了自己所熟悉的哈尔滨、沈阳、重庆等地的美丽风景、大工厂和富饶的田野。如徐嘉陵同学介绍说：“我生长在美丽的嘉陵江边，房子旁边有大片的竹林，江里的来往的大船装满着橘子和糖……。”李乃江介绍他的家乡山东黄县的情形说：“那里真是一个好地方，北面是渤海，南面是一眼望不到边的大平原。到五、六月的时候，你可以看到一边是金黄色的麦浪，一边是蓝色的大海。”这些介绍，引起了孩子们对祖国的无限热爱。有的说：“咱们有这样美好的国家，决不能让美国恶魔来破坏。”
    五年级的同学结合着地理课的学习还组织了“旅行家小组”。他们的“旅行”是在室内进行的。他们第一次旅行的目的地是祖国的首都——北京。教师帮助同学事先画好首都及沿途的地图，搜集了数百张首都及沿途城市的彩色图片。这些图片使大家看到了首都的名胜古迹、伟大的天安门、石景山钢铁厂。同学们看到金光闪闪，宫殿巍峨，技工精巧的古代建筑形象，都十分敬仰我们祖先们伟大的创造力。当大家听说收藏在故宫博物院的大批珍贵的古物被蒋介石盗卖到美国的事情时，心里激起莫大的愤怒。教师还用讲故事的方法，给大家讲了过去封建皇帝统治人民及八个帝国主义国家联合进犯北京火烧圆明园的情形。介绍了历史上有名的“五四”、“一二九”革命运动。讲述了一九四九年十月一日毛主席在天安门宣布中华人民共和国成立的伟大意义。同时，教师并朗读一些描写和歌颂人民首都的文章、诗篇。这次课堂旅行给同学们留下了深刻的印象。大家对祖国的光荣和伟大感到骄傲；对帝国主义、封建主义的残暴和无耻十分痛恨。
