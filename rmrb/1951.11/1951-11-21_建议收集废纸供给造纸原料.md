    Suggest Collecting Waste Paper to Supply Papermaking Raw Materials
    Editor: After reading Comrade Wang Ze's suggestion on economizing paper usage for national office staff in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on the 12th of this month, I feel that I am also one of the 500,000 people that Comrade Wang Ze calculated. I think Comrade Wang Ze's suggestion is worth everyone's attention. Take our office as an example, the amount of paper wasted every day is indeed too much. In addition to raising everyone's awareness and economizing paper usage, we should also find ways to utilize the unavoidable waste paper. In our office, many waste papers are burned for confidentiality purposes; and of the hundreds of newspapers subscribed to by the entire office, except for a few that are kept for reference, the rest are discarded randomly. This is all very regrettable. We currently do not have a good method for handling waste paper, so I suggest that various paper mills may as well purchase waste paper through local native product companies. Currently, China's papermaking raw materials are still insufficient. If the recycled waste paper can be made into pulp, it can solve part of the raw material problem and increase the country's wealth at the same time. Wang Ruqing
    Editor's note: The Northeast region is promoting the "waste paper recycling" method. After implementing this method, it is estimated that the value saved in the entire Northeast in one year can be equal to 70,000 tons of grain or 28 fighter planes. The Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government is also studying waste paper collection and destruction methods. Once results are available, it can be piloted nationwide.

### 建议收集废纸供给造纸原料

    建议收集废纸供给造纸原料
    编辑同志：看到人民日报本月十二日“读者来信”栏中所载王则同志对全国机关工作人员节约用纸的建议后，我感到我也是属于王则同志所计算的五十万人中的一个，我觉得王则同志的建议是值得大家注意的。就以我们机关来说，每天浪费的纸确是太多了。除了应该使大家提高警惕，节约用纸之外，对于不得已的废纸还是要设法加以利用才好。在我们机关里为了保密，许多废纸烧毁了；而在全机关所订的几百份报纸中，除了少数的留存以备查阅外，其余的都乱丢了。这都是很可惜的。我们目前还没有处理废纸的好方法，所以我建议各个造纸厂不妨通过各地土产公司收购废纸。现在我国的造纸原料仍感不足，如果能将收回的废纸做成纸浆，自可解决一部分原料问题，同时又可为国家增加了财富。王汝清
    编者按：东北区正推行“废纸回收”办法，实行这个办法后，估计全东北一年所节省的价值可等于七万吨粮食或二十八架战斗机。中央人民政府轻工业部也正在研究废纸收集和销毁办法，俟有结果，即可开始在全国试行。
