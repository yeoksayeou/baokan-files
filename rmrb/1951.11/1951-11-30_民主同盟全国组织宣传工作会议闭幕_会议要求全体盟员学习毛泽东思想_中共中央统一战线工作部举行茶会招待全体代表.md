Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The China Democratic League convened a national organization and propaganda work conference in Beijing on November 13th. Over 170 representatives attended, including heads of various departments of the Democratic League headquarters and heads of organization and propaganda work from various local and overseas branches. The conference lasted 15 days and closed on the 27th.

Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee last December, the China Democratic League has seen significant development and progress. The Sixth Plenary Session decided that resisting America, aiding Korea, and developing and consolidating the organization should be the central tasks of the Democratic League. Over the past year, Democratic League organizations and members in various regions have participated in the three major movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, as well as various tasks such as democratic state-building, cultural education, and financial economy. Organizations in various regions have absorbed a number of outstanding new members. The Democratic League's prestige among the masses has increased, and its role in the people's democratic united front has also grown. This national organization and propaganda work conference was convened under the new circumstances of the Democratic League's development and progress. The main purpose of the conference was to exchange work experiences from various regions, solve several major problems in organization and propaganda work, in order to improve work, implement current political tasks, and continue to develop and consolidate the organization.

The conference began with a speech by Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic League. He encouraged all comrades in the League to work hard to implement current political tasks and consolidate unity. Subsequently, Vice Chairman Shen Junru made a report on the spirit of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He called on League members to study the various documents of the Third Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, study Mao Zedong Thought, and take promoting the three major movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and ideological remoulding as the central work of the Democratic League. Zhang Bojun, Secretary-General of the Political Bureau of the Democratic League Central Committee, who had just returned from Vienna after attending the Second Session of the World Peace Council, also gave a report on the resolutions of the World Peace Council.

Luo Longji, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the headquarters, made a "Report on Organization and Propaganda Work Since the Sixth Plenary Session." In his report, Luo Longji pointed out: The Democratic League has achieved great success in participating in and promoting the patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea in the past year, especially in carrying out patriotic propaganda and education and donating weapons. League members in various regions have also achieved great success in assisting religious circles in carrying out the self-reliance and reform movement and severing ties with imperialism. 978 League members went to the countryside to participate in the land reform movement. League members in various regions participated in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and reported counter-revolutionary elements. Due to participating in mass work, League members' ideological understanding has generally improved. In terms of organizational development, up to recently, the Democratic League has developed a total of 85 general branches, branches, and sub-branches domestically, not including district branches and overseas organizations. It is estimated that the number of League members will increase by more than double by the end of this year compared to a year ago. Among the new League members, cultural and educational workers account for 60%, government workers account for 20%, and the rest are from the industrial and commercial sectors and technical personnel; and many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have been admitted into the League.

During the conference, Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, and Hu Qiaomu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, were invited to give reports on the current situation and tasks and ideological remoulding issues, respectively. Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, also spoke at the tea party to entertain the representatives.

On the last day of the conference, Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Organization Committee of the headquarters, made a summary report, and Guo Zecheng, Deputy Director of the Organization Committee, and Huang Yaomian, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Committee, respectively made summary reports on the discussions of organizational and propaganda affairs. The participating representatives unanimously agreed to take the three major central tasks put forward by the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference—resisting America, aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and ideological remoulding—as the current central tasks of the Democratic League. The participating representatives also unanimously believed that the future organizational work of the Democratic League should focus on development and continue to consolidate the organization. Democratic League members should carry out self-education and self-remoulding, and take the lead in the ideological remoulding movement among intellectuals. The conference called on all League members to "arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and strive to victoriously implement the three major tasks decided by the National Committee of the CPPCC, and to continue to develop and consolidate the organization." The conference finally adopted various reports and proposals, and also adopted a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee held a tea party on November 24th to entertain all the representatives of the National Organization and Propaganda Work Conference of the China Democratic League. Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Democratic League, Zhang Bojun, Secretary-General, and heads of various departments of the headquarters were also invited to attend. Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the meeting. He congratulated the Democratic League on its unity, development, and progress. Zhang Bojun and Shen Junru spoke successively, calling on all representatives and League members to work harder in the future and strive to realize the three central tasks put forward by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC.

    中共中央统一战线工作部举行茶会招待全体代表 【新华社二十九日讯】中国民主同盟在十一月十三日在北京召开了全国组织宣传工作会议，出席代表有民盟总部各部门负责人和各地方及海外支分部的组织宣传工作负责人共一百七十多人。会议历时十五日，已在二十七日闭幕。
    中国民主同盟自从去年十二月六中全会以后有显著的发展和进步。六中全会决定以抗美援朝、发展和巩固组织作为民盟的中心任务。一年以来，各地民盟组织和盟员参加了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，参加了民主建政、文化教育以及财政经济等各项工作。各地组织都吸收了一批优秀的新盟员。民盟在群众中的威信提高了，在人民民主统一战线中的作用也增大了。这次全国组织宣传工作会议就是在民盟发展和进步的新情况下召开的。会议的主要目的是交流各地工作经验，解决组织宣传工作中的若干主要问题，以求改进工作，执行当前政治任务和继续发展与巩固组织。
    会议首先由民盟中央委员会主席张澜讲话。他鼓励全盟同志努力执行当前政治任务，巩固团结。继由副主席沈钧儒作了关于人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的传达报告。他号召盟员学习人民政协全国委员会第三次会议的各项文件，学习毛泽东思想，并以推进抗美援朝、增产节约、思想改造三大运动作为民盟的中心工作。民盟中央政治局秘书长章伯钧刚从维也纳参加世界和平理事会第二次会议回来，也在会上作了关于世界和平理事会各项决议的报告。
    会议由总部宣传委员会主任罗隆基作了“六中全会以来组织宣传工作报告”。罗隆基在报告中指出：民盟在过去一年中参加和推动抗美援朝爱国主义运动，特别是进行爱国主义的宣传教育工作和捐献武器的工作，有很大的成绩。各地盟员协助宗教界进行自立革新运动，切断和帝国主义的关系，也有很大的成就。盟员有九百七十八人下乡参加土地改革运动。各地盟员都参加了镇压反革命运动，检举了反革命分子。由于参加群众工作，盟员思想认识一般都提高了一步。在发展组织的工作方面，到最近为止，国内民盟的总支部、支部、分部已发展到八十五个单位，区分部及海外组织尚不计在内。估计盟员人数到今年年底将比一年前增加一倍以上。新盟员中文教工作者占百分之六十，机关工作者占百分之二十，其余为工商界和技术人员等；并有不少共产党员、青年团员被吸收入盟。
    在会议进行期间，中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席彭真和中共中央宣传部副部长胡乔木分别应邀作了关于目前形势任务和思想改造问题的报告。中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉也在招待与会代表的茶话会上讲话。
    会议最后一日，由总部组织委员会主任胡愈之作了总结报告，组织委员会副主任郭则沉和宣传委员会副主任黄药眠分别作了关于组织业务和宣传业务的讨论总结报告。与会代表一致同意以中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第三次会议所提出的三大中心任务——抗美援朝、增产节约、思想改造——作为民盟的当前中心任务。与会代表又一致认为：今后民盟的组织工作要以发展为主，继续巩固组织。民盟盟员要进行自我教育和自我改造，并在知识分子中带头进行思想改造运动。会议要求全体盟员“用马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想武装起来，为胜利地执行人民政协全国委员会所决定的三大任务，为继续发展和巩固组织而斗争”。会议最后通过了各项报告和建议案，并通过了向毛主席及中国人民志愿军致敬电。
    【新华社二十九日讯】中共中央统一战线工作部十一月二十四日举行茶会招待中国民主同盟全国组织宣传工作会议的全体代表。民主同盟副主席沈钧儒、秘书长章伯钧和总部各部门负责人也应邀到会。中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉在会上讲话。他祝贺民主同盟团结、发展和进步。章伯钧和沈钧儒相继发言，号召全体代表和盟员今后更加努力工作，为实现人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议所提出的三项中心任务而奋斗。
