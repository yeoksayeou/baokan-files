New People, New Deeds

    Beijing Machine Factory Successfully Creates Herringbone Gear Shaping Machine
    Editor: The Beijing Machine Factory of the Machine Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department has successfully manufactured China's first herringbone gear shaping machine. The herringbone gear shaping machine is a precise, heavy-duty machine tool, indispensable for manufacturing rotating gears for giant machines such as mining machinery, power generation machinery, ships, and rolling mills. The successful trial production of the herringbone gear shaping machine will make a tremendous contribution to the development of China's heavy industry. When the factory decided to start the trial production in early May, some workers thought: This machine has never been manufactured in China before. Can we complete this task with a factory like ours? Indeed, the factory's equipment was old, and everyone lacked experience in manufacturing this type of machine. However, under the repeated encouragement and support of the leading cadres, the confidence of every worker was finally boosted. During the trial production process, the three shifts of workers on the rotary tool holder moved to sleep next to the lathe for collective research; Dai Yuben, the director of the workshop, who was recuperating in the Summer Palace, returned to the factory one day early to solve the problem of the tool holder support hole; the workers of the Mechanical Engineering Department only slept for one hour in two days and one night. In this way, they overcame many difficulties and finally succeeded in the trial production on September 29.

    Successfully Manufactured Model 7-51 Diesel Pile Driver
    Editor: The First Machine Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau has successfully created the Model 7-51 diesel pile driver. Pile driving is a basic task in construction engineering, and whether it is solid or not will determine the service life of the construction project. This pile driver is mainly suitable for large-scale construction projects such as water conservancy and bridges. This pile driver is lighter and simpler than a steam pile driver, and the manufacturing cost is only a quarter of that of a steam pile driver. During the manufacturing process, the factory’s leading cadres mobilized the masses and tried to adopt everyone’s opinions, thus overcoming difficulties such as insufficient equipment, and finally completed the planned plan on schedule.

    Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao
    My Family's Sixty-Year-Old Grievance Has Been Redressed
    Editor: I am an old woman living in Cang County, Hebei Province. My father suffered from hunger and poverty since he was a child. He originally had eight mu of land, which he mortgaged to others. When my father was in his twenties, the land deed for these eight mu of land was stolen by the bad guy Ren Qing'an (a rich peasant), who redeemed it and cultivated it himself, claiming that the Lü family sold it to him. This has been going on for more than sixty years. Before liberation, my father sued this matter to the then Cang County "government." The bad guy Ren Qing'an had money and power, bribed the yamen, and my father was arrested instead. My father went crazy with anger and was driven out of prison. My mother went crazy too and soon died. At that time, I thought, when will this grievance be redressed!
    After liberation, everyone said: "In the new society led by Chairman Mao, the poor can redress their grievances and speak reasonably." Last year, I went to the Special District Court to file a complaint. A few days later, a comrade from the court came to tell me: "We have investigated and found that your parents really died unjustly. The bad guy Ren Qing'an is dead. His son, Ren Baochen, brought out the 'red deed' from more than sixty years ago to compare with the real 'red deed'. The 'red deed' turned out to be fake, and the land is yours. Ren Baochen admitted his mistake and returned the land to you."
    The grievance was redressed, and I immediately ran to my ancestral grave, crying and telling my dead parents, "Your grievances have been redressed by Chairman Mao today!" Editor, this is a happy event. Please publish it in the newspaper of the people to speak for me these heartfelt words.

    Liangfu Township Suffered from Floods Every Year Before Liberation
    After Liberation, Dykes Were Built, Resulting in Two Consecutive Years of Good Harvests
    Liangfu Township, Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, is an island in the middle of the Yangtze River, surrounded by dikes, with 11,070 mu of land inside the dikes. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liangfu Township was flooded for twelve years from 1932 to 1949, when it was liberated. In years of flooding, all the farmers in the village had to flee to escape famine. Even in years with small floods, although the river water did not enter the dikes, the water accumulation in the dikes would still cause disasters, flooding more than 6,000 mu of land at most. After the Communist Party came, the People's Government immediately called on the farmers who had fled to return to their hometowns, issued them food, and led them to repair the dikes. Therefore, they have had good harvests for two consecutive years after liberation. The dikes have been repaired, but the water accumulation inside the dikes must also be solved. The Pengze County People's Government also tried to lend the township a water pump. In June, with the help of the workers, the machine was quickly installed, which eliminated the water accumulation in the 800 mu of cotton fields in the dikes, thus enabling the entire township’s 3,600 mu of cotton fields to harvest 1 million jin of seed cotton. The farmers said happily, "Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the help of the working-class elder brothers, how could we have such a good year?"    Wang Zhenhua

    北京机器厂创制人字轮铡齿机成功
    编辑同志：中央重工业部机器工业局北京机器厂制造中国第一部人字轮铡齿机成功。人字轮铡齿机是一种精密的重型的工作母机，是制造矿山机器、发电机械、轮船和轧钢机等巨型机器的转动齿轮所不可缺少的机器。人字轮铡齿机的试制成功，对我国重工业的发展将有巨大的贡献。当该厂在五月上旬决定试制时，有些工人曾认为：这种机器，中国从来没有制造过，凭咱们这样的厂能完成这个任务吗？的确，该厂的设备是陈旧的，而且，大家也没有制造这种机器的经验。但在领导干部的一再鼓励和支持下，终于提高了每个工人的信心。在试制过程中，旋刀架的三班工人为了集体研究，搬到了车床旁边睡觉；车间主任戴愉本在颐和园休养，为了解决刀架摚孔的问题，便提前一天赶回厂；机工部的工人曾经在两天一夜中只睡了一小时。这样，他们到底克服了很多的困难，于九月二十九日试制成功。

    制造七—五一型柴油打桩机成功编辑同志：济南工业局第一机器厂创制七—五一型柴油打桩机成功。打桩是建筑工程中的一项基本工作，打得坚固与否将决定建筑工程的使用年限。这种打桩机，主要适用于水利、桥梁等大规模的建筑工程。这种打桩机比蒸汽打桩机轻便简单，制造成本仅占蒸汽打桩机的四分之一。在制造过程中，由于该厂领导干部发动了群众，尽量采纳大家的意见，因而克服了设备不够等困难，终于按期完成了预定的计划。    俞再岐
    在毛主席领导下
    我家伸了六十年的冤编辑同志：我是一个老婆婆，住河北省沧县。父亲从小挨饿受穷，原有八亩地，典给了别人。在我父亲二十多岁的时候，这八亩地的地契被坏蛋任清安（富农）偷了，并赎过去自己种着，说是吕家卖给他的。到现在已经六十多年了。我爹在解放前，曾将此事告到那时候的沧县“政府”去。坏蛋任清安有钱有势，买通衙门，我爹反而被押起来。我爹气疯了，从狱里给赶出来，娘随着也疯了，不久便都死去。当时我想，这个冤什么时候能伸啊！
    解放后，人人都说：“毛主席领导的新社会，穷人是可以伸冤说理的。”去年，我到专区法院告状。不几天，法院同志来告诉我：“我们调查过了，你爹娘真是冤枉死的。坏蛋任清安已经死了，他儿子任宝臣拿出六十多年前的‘红契’来看，对出‘红契’是假的，地是你家的。任宝臣承认错误，把地还给你。”
    冤伸了，我马上跑到祖坟上，哭着告诉死了的爹娘，“你们的冤枉，今天毛主席给伸了！”编辑同志，这是喜事啊，请你登在老百姓自己的报上，替我说说这些心里的话。

    粮富乡解放以前连年遭水灾
    解放后修了堤一连两年好收成
    江西彭泽县粮富乡，是长江中间的一块洲地，四周都是圩堤，堤里有一万一千零七十亩地。国民党反动派统治时代，粮富乡从一九三二年起到一九四九年解放时止，十八年中就淹了十二年。一到水灾年头，全村农民都只好出外逃荒，就是在水小的年头，江水虽不进堤，圩内积水也要成灾，最多时，淹过六千多亩地。共产党来了，人民政府马上号召逃荒在外的农民回乡，并发给他们口粮，领导他们修堤，所以解放后一连两年都得到好收成。堤是修好了，但圩内积水也必须解决。彭泽县人民政府又设法贷给该乡一部抽水机。六月间，经过工人的帮助，很快把机子安装起来，排除了圩内八百亩棉田的积水，因而使全乡三千六百亩棉田，可收籽棉
    一百万斤。农民们高兴地说：“如果没有共产党毛主席的领导和工人老大哥的帮助，那会有这样好的年景。”    王振华
