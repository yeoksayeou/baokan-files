We Students Sincerely Hope Teachers Will Boldly Expose Shortcomings in Their Work
To the Editor: University teachers bear the responsibility of cultivating talent for construction, and they must undergo ideological remolding; otherwise, our teaching work cannot be done well.

There are many ideological problems among our teachers. Some teachers lack sufficient understanding of the power of the people, do not pay attention to the advanced science of the Soviet Union, and often mechanically transplant the set of teaching materials of the European and American bourgeoisie without criticism when lecturing. Many professors hope to write their research insights into articles and send them to foreign countries (especially the United States) for publication. They think that publishing them in their own country is "not powerful enough"; they use English or mix in English when lecturing, and some professors have never written Chinese on the blackboard. They believe that Chinese cannot fully express scientific problems. These thoughts of the teachers seriously hinder the reform of higher education.

In order to enable teachers to study better, our students have sincerely helped teachers arrange study rooms and collect study materials. When the teachers are busy studying and cannot compile the lecture notes for a while, the students say: "We don't need lecture notes, let's browse some reference books!" We also wrote congratulatory letters to the teachers, hoping that they could boldly expose their shortcomings and criticize the unreasonable phenomena in their work.

    我们学生诚恳希望教师们大胆地揭发工作中的缺点
    编辑同志：高等学校教师负着培养建设人材的任务，他们必须进行思想改造，否则我们的教学工作是无法搞好的。
    我们的教师中存在着不少的思想问题。有一些教师对人民的力量缺乏足够的认识，对苏联的先进科学不加重视，讲课时往往毫无批判地硬搬欧美资产阶级的一套教学材料。许多教授希望把研究心得写成文章寄到外国（特别是美国）去发表，他们认为在本国发表是“不够劲”的；讲课时用英语，或夹杂着英语，有的教授从来没有在黑板上写过中文。他们认为中文不能完全表达科学上的问题，教师们的这些思想，严重地阻碍着高等教育的改革。
    为了使教师们学习得更好，我们同学们曾诚恳地帮教师布置学习室，搜集学习资料。当教师们忙于学习，讲义一时编不出的时候，同学们就说：“讲义不要了，我们翻阅些参考书吧！”我们还向教师们写贺信，希望他们能大胆地揭发自己的缺点，批评工作中的不合理现象。　华北大学工学院通讯组
