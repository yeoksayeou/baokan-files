Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 10th: This reporter interviewed representatives from Iran, Egypt, and Iraq who attended the Second Session of the World Peace Council. They commented on the national liberation movements of the people of the Middle East against imperialist aggression.

　　Eskandari, a member of the World Peace Council and representative of Iran, said: The wish of the Iranian people is to eradicate imperialist forces from Iran. The initial victory of the oil nationalization movement is entirely due to the growing strength of the Iranian people, and also to the growing strength of the awakening people of the Middle East. This is a great contribution to world peace. Eskandari spoke about the future development of the Iranian people's national liberation movement, saying: Once the Iranian people's movement for independence begins, it will not stop. Although reactionary forces are increasing pressure, the movement will continue to persist, and the Iranian people will eventually defeat imperialism. Eskandari emphasized: The Soviet Union has given Iran a lot of assistance in the United Nations; the liberation of the Chinese people has given the Iranian people great spiritual encouragement, and the example of the Chinese people has convinced the Iranian people that they can definitely defeat the reactionary forces.

　　Nabarawi, a representative of Egypt elected as a member of the World Peace Council, said: The atrocities of British troops in Egypt have aroused resistance from the broad masses of the Egyptian people, and mass movements are being carried out. Although the workers in the Suez Canal Zone do not have weapons, they have picked up stones to fight back against the imperialists. The Egyptian people have launched a movement to boycott British goods. Nabarawi said: The United States and Britain are trying to drag the Egyptian people into a war of aggression. Seventy years of oppressive experience have made the Egyptian people realize that they must rise up against the aggressors and oppose the establishment of military bases by US and British imperialism in the Middle East. The Egyptian people and the Arab people unite, and with the support of world public opinion, they will stop the atrocities of the British army.

　　De Javasheri, a member of the World Peace Council and representative of Iraq, said: Although the Iraqi people have encountered many difficulties, the movement against imperialism will definitely continue to develop. De Javasheri said: The Middle Eastern countries are closely connected and their interests are related. We are all influenced by the October Revolution and the victory of the Chinese Revolution, and we are also influencing each other. Imperialism wants to alienate our feelings, but we are moving forward hand in hand. Finally, De Javasheri paid tribute to the Chinese people on behalf of the Iraqi people.

    谈中东人民反帝斗争
    各国人民决坚持斗争反抗侵略 【新华社维也纳十日电】本社记者访问了出席世界和平理事会第二届会议的伊朗、埃及和伊拉克的代表。他们对中东人民反对帝国主义侵略的民族解放运动发表了评论。
    世界和平理事会理事、伊朗代表艾斯堪德里说：伊朗人民的愿望，是要把帝国主义势力从伊朗连根拔除。石油国有化运动的获得初步胜利，完全是由于伊朗人民力量日益强大的结果，同时也是觉醒中的中东各国人民的力量日益强大的结果。这对于世界和平有很大的贡献。艾斯堪德里谈到伊朗人民民族解放运动发展的前途说：伊朗人民要求独立的运动，一经展开就不会停止。虽然反动势力在增加压力，但运动将继续坚持下去，伊朗人民最后必将战胜帝国主义。艾斯堪德里强调说：苏联曾在联合国给伊朗很多援助；中国人民的解放在精神上给了伊朗人民很大的鼓励，中国人民的榜样使伊朗人民深信：一定可以打倒反动力量。
    本届世界和平理事会选出的理事、埃及代表娜巴拉薇说：英军在埃及的暴行已引起广大埃及人民的反抗，群众运动正在开展。苏彝士运河区工人虽然没有武器，但是他们已拿起石头来还击帝国主义者。埃及人民已发动了抵制英国货的运动。娜巴拉薇说：美国和英国企图使埃及人民卷入侵略战争。七十年来被压迫的经验，已使埃及人民知道：必须起来反抗侵略者，反对美英帝国主义在中东建立军事基地。埃及人民和阿拉伯人民团结起来，在世界舆论支援下，将制止英军的暴行。
    世界和平理事会理事、伊拉克代表德雅瓦希利说：伊拉克人民虽然遇到不少的困难，但是反抗帝国主义的运动必能继续发展。德雅瓦希利说：中东国家都密切相连，利害相关。我们都受到十月革命的影响，也受到中国革命胜利的影响，我们彼此之间又在互相影响着。帝国主义想要离间我们的感情，但是我们正在携手前进。德雅瓦希利最后代表伊拉克人民向中国人民致敬。
