Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th: The American aggressor troops have once again shamelessly deployed poison gas on the Korean battlefield, but this cannot salvage the crushing defeat of their so-called "Autumn Offensive." On October 4th, two battalions of American aggressor troops, coordinated by aircraft and artillery, launched an attack on the 312.8 high ground of Tiande Mountain, west of Tieyuan, defended by our forces. After more than ten waves of group assaults were bravely repelled by our army, the enemy used long-range artillery to fire more than 20 rounds of poison gas shells in yellow, purple, and brown colors at our positions. These poison gas shells exploded, emitting large amounts of smoke with a sulfurous odor. Those who were poisoned on the spot suffered from difficulty breathing, tearing eyes, swollen and bruised eyelids, and unconsciousness. Half an hour after firing the poison gas shells, the enemy launched a group assault with a company of soldiers. Our commanders and fighters, deeply enraged by the enemy's despicable behavior, resolutely counterattacked, using dense fire and waves of hand grenades to kill large numbers of the despicable enemy in front of our positions. Our frontline commanders and fighters have unanimously expressed their determination to use even more heroic combat to inflict even more devastating defeats on the enemy.

    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】美国侵略军竟又无耻地在朝鲜战场上施放毒气，但这并不能挽救其所谓“秋季攻势”的惨重失败。十月四日，美国侵略军两个营在飞机大炮的配合下，向我铁原以西天德山的三一二点八高地进犯。敌军在十多次集团冲锋均被我军奋勇击退后，竟以远射程炮向我阵地发射黄、紫、棕三种颜色的毒气弹二十余枚。这些毒气炮弹炸裂后，散发大量烟雾，带有硫磺味，当场中毒者呼吸困难，双眼流泪，眼皮青肿，昏迷不醒。敌军在发射毒气弹后半小时，即以一个连的兵力向我发起集团冲锋。被敌军卑鄙行为所深深激怒了的我军指战员奋起迎击，用密集的火力和成群的手榴弹，把可恶的敌军大批击毙在阵地前面。我前线指战员一致表示要以更英勇的作战来使敌人遭到更惨重的失败。
