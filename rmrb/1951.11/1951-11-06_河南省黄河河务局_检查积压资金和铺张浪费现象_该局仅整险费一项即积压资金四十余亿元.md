The Henan Yellow River Bureau has considerably serious confusion in its budget and final accounts system and financial system. After five days of inspection, the following serious problems have been discovered:

First, creating large budgets and accumulating funds. The bureau's compensation expenses this year only account for 18.5% of the budgeted amount (the budget was to compensate for repairing embankments occupying 2,000 mu of land, while the actual compensation was for 673 mu; the original budget was 250,000 yuan per mu, while the actual expenditure was 138,000 yuan); the unit prices of hemp materials and stone materials were also set relatively high. The bureau has over 4 billion yuan remaining in the river strengthening expenses alone this year.

Second, diverting water conservancy construction funds to build houses violates the principle of special funds for special purposes. The bureau built buildings without making a budget, diverting 120 million yuan from water conservancy construction funds. When building the buildings, they did not design well, changing as they built, causing great waste. The Chen (Liu) Lan (Feng) repair and defense section, subordinate to the bureau, initially did not have a budget for building a large building, but later also built a large building; the repair and defense section also used the remaining funds from repairing flood prevention houses to build offices. These two items alone diverted 100.84 million yuan of water conservancy construction funds. This is a violation of the financial system.

Third, illegally disbursing miscellaneous income, arbitrarily engaging in extravagance and waste. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government, miscellaneous income should be turned over to the higher authorities, but the bureau misappropriated this item of funds to subsidize whenever there was an overspending. This year, the bureau held a total of four meetings, and three of them exceeded the budget. The flood prevention meeting was originally budgeted at 2 million yuan, but actually overspent by 2.6 million yuan; the overspending accounted for 130% of the budgeted amount. When the bureau had overspending, it made up for it with miscellaneous income, forming an illegal system. In the past two years, 40 million yuan has been spent from miscellaneous income.

The reasons for the above errors are, first of all, that the bureau only considers the convenience of its own unit when making budgets, regardless of the interests of the state, only engaging in subjective fabrication, and not asking about actual needs. Relevant cadres have the idea that it is always better to make the budget bigger than smaller, and more is always better than less, so that state funds cannot play their due role. Also, because leading cadres lack investigation and research, they cannot reasonably approve and reduce the budgets of the lower units, often allocating as much as the lower units ask for. Some leading cadres have the extravagant and wasteful idea that "now is different from the past, and now meetings and work should be more generous, and overspending a little is not too much," which is also an important reason for this situation.

    河南省黄河河务局
    检查积压资金和铺张浪费现象
    该局仅整险费一项即积压资金四十余亿元
    河南省黄河河务局的预算决算制度和财政制度中，存在着相当严重的混乱情况。经过五天检查，已发现如下几个严重问题：
    第一，造大预算，积压资金。该局今年的赔偿费开支数只占预算数的百分之十八点五（预算赔偿修堤占地两千亩，实际赔偿六百七十三亩，原预算一亩为二十五万元，实支十三万八千元）；麻料、石料单价订的也较高。该局今年仅整险费一项，即剩余四十余亿元。
    第二，挪用水利建设资金修建房屋，违背专款专用的原则。该局不造预算就盖楼房，挪借水利建设资金一亿二千万元。盖楼房时又不很好设计，一面盖一面改，造成很大浪费。该局所属陈（留）兰（封）修防段，最初没有预算盖大楼，后来也盖了大楼；该修防段还将修防汛屋的剩余款盖成办公室。仅这两项，即挪用水利建设费一亿零八百四十万元。这是违犯了财政制度的。
    第三，非法开支杂项收益，任意铺张浪费。按中央人民政府水利部规定，杂项收益均应上解，但该局每逢超支即挪用该项款项贴补。今年该局共召开四个会议，有三个会议超过预算。防汛会议原预算二百万元，竟超支二百六十万元；超支数占预算数的百分之一百三十。该局发生超支情况，就以杂项收益弥补，形成了一种不合法的制度。两年以来，从杂项收益内即开支四千万元。
    产生上述错误的原因，首先是该局在做预算时，只顾自己单位方便，不管国家利益，只管主观编造，不问实际需要。有关干部存在着预算做大点总比小点强，多点总比少点好的思想，致使国家资金不能发挥应有的效用。又因为领导干部缺乏调查研究，对下面各单位的预算，就不能合理的核增核减，往往是下边要多少就拨多少。某些领导干部存在着“现在和过去不同了，现在开会做事应该放大方些，超支点也不算多”的铺张浪费思想，也是发生这种情况的重要原因。（陈渊）
