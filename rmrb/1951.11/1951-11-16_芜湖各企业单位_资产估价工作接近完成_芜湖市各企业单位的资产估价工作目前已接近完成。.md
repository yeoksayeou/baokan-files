　　Asset Valuation Work Nearly Completed in Wuhu Enterprises
    The asset valuation work of various enterprises and units in Wuhu City is now nearing completion.
    The organizations for clearing assets and verifying funds in various enterprises and units throughout the city have been joined by many enthusiastic workers. The valuation work of each unit is carried out according to the price standards of various properties stipulated by the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee. For assets without stipulated price standards, the workers automatically took time out to inquire everywhere in the market or write letters to relevant departments in other places to ask for prices. The Wuhu City Asset Clearing and Funding Verification Committee finally collected the prices inquired by various units, conducted evaluations, and formulated unified and accurate standards, so that various enterprises and units had a basis for valuing various assets. When identifying the service life of machines, most units invited veteran technicians to carefully inspect and identify the degree of newness of the machines, and then after everyone's discussion, finally estimated the service life of the machines.
    Through this asset clearing and valuation work, employees of various enterprises and units have become more protective of state property. Workers at the Wuhu Municipal People's Government Grain Processing Factory found many useful materials from the waste materials and assembled a transport vehicle for a rice milling machine, saving the state about 5 to 6 million yuan. At the same time, when they were appraising the service life of the rice milling machine, they researched a method to improve the machine, which increased the daily output by one hour of rice production compared to the past.

　　芜湖各企业单位
    资产估价工作接近完成
    芜湖市各企业单位的资产估价工作目前已接近完成。
    全市各企业单位清理资产核定资金的组织，都有很多职工中的积极分子参加。各单位的估价工作，是根据华东军政委员会工业部所规定的各项财产的价格标准进行的。对于没有规定价格标准的资产，职工们便自动抽空在市面上到处打听，或写信到外埠有关部门问价钱。芜湖市清理资产核定资金委员会最后收集各单位打听来的价格，进行评议，制定了统一的准确的标准，使各企业单位对各种资产的估价都有了依据。各单位在鉴定机器使用年限时，对于这种机器，大部分请老年技术工人来仔细检查、辨明机器的新旧程度，再经过大家讨论，最后才推算出机器的使用年限。
    各企业单位职工经过这次资产清理的估价工作，对国家财产更加爱护。芜湖市人民政府财政局粮食加工厂的工人就从清理废料中找出很多有用材料，装成了一部碾米机上用的运车，约给国家节省五、六十万元。同时，他们还在鉴定碾米机使用年限时，研究出改良机器的办法，使每天产量比过去增加了一小时的出米量。（新华社）
