Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 4th: TASS reports: Egyptian Foreign Minister Salah al-Din held a press conference on November 1st. In answering questions posed by foreign journalists, he said: Egypt does not want British troops or any other foreign troops stationed on its territory. Someone asked: If Egypt does not want foreign help, does it have the ability to defend the Suez Canal on its own? Salah al-Din replied: If Britain thinks that the Egyptian army does not have the ability to defend the Suez Canal, then it is mistaken. Someone asked him to comment on the recent sharp increase in the number of British troops in the Suez Canal Zone. He said: He sees no reason for such a sharp increase in British troops. Salah al-Din said: If this is being done to provoke a war, then this war will not be due to Egypt's fault; Egypt does not want to fight. Salah al-Din then declared to reporters: He has notified the governor of Port Said to protest to Britain against its recent actions of expelling Egyptian police officers and citizens from the Suez Canal Zone. Salah al-Din continued: But the only response from Britain has been to continue the expulsions. The Egyptian government can no longer tolerate such actions, and the Egyptian government has ways to stop them. Salah al-Din's statement on the Suez Canal Zone incidents pointed out: British military authorities are still arresting and searching Egyptian citizens, and expelling them from the Suez Canal Zone.
    According to the "Egyptian Gazette", twenty-five British soldiers searched the home of Abdul Sami, chairman of the Seamen's Union, in Suez. Abdul Sami was arrested and taken to the wilderness outside the city. He was threatened that he must not return to Suez. The newspaper continued: Workers in the Suez Canal Zone expressed their indignation at these actions by the British. They said: If anything similar happens again, they will seize British people as hostages.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: Telecommunications Agency, Tel Aviv: The Political Bureau of the Israeli Communist Party, in a resolution on Egypt published on October 30th, stated that the Egyptian people's struggle for liberation is a "just struggle and is in the interests of the people of all Middle Eastern countries."
    The resolution said: From Tehran to Cairo, there are only a small number of warmongers and oppressors of the people of all countries, namely the British and American imperialists. The Egyptian people have expressed their determination to wage a resolute struggle for liberation in the continuous mass demonstrations against British and American imperialism and demanding friendship with the Soviet Union, thereby strengthening the struggle for liberation of the people of all Middle Eastern countries. All freedom-loving and peace-loving people in Israel welcome this struggle and pay tribute to the Egyptian people. The Israeli people abhor imperialist armed intervention in the internal affairs of the Egyptian people.
    The resolution called on the Israeli people to hold more demonstrations in support of the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle and the struggle of the people of all Middle Eastern countries to defend peace.

    斥英继续增兵运河区
    以色列共产党声援埃及人民
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社开罗讯：埃及外交大臣赛拉哈丁十一月一日举行记者招待会，他在回答外国记者所提的问题时说：埃及不愿意它的领土上驻有英国军队或其他任何外国的军队。有人问：埃及不要外国帮助，自己是否有能力保卫苏彝士运河？赛拉哈丁答道：假如英国以为埃及军队没有能力保卫苏彝士运河，那它就想错了。有人请他对近来苏彝士运河区英国军队数量激增一事发表意见，他说：他看不出英军这样激增的理由。赛拉哈丁说：假如这样做是为了引起战争的话，那么，这个战争就不是由于埃及的缘故了，埃及是并不想打仗的。赛拉哈丁接着向记者宣称：他已通知塞得港的地方长官向英国提出抗议，抗议它不久以前从苏彝士运河区驱逐埃及的警官和公民的行动。赛拉哈丁继称：可是英国唯一的回答却是继续驱逐。埃及政府不能再忍受这种行动了，埃及政府有办法予以制止。赛拉哈丁关于苏彝士运河区事件的声明指出：英国军事当局仍然在逮捕和搜查埃及公民，并且把他们从苏彝士运河区驱逐出来。
    据“埃及人报”报道，二十五名英军士兵在苏彝士搜查了海员工会主席阿布杜尔·沙密的家。阿布杜尔·沙密被捕，并被送到城外旷野中。有人威胁他说：他不得再回到苏彝士去。该报继称：苏彝士运河区的工人对英国人的这些行动表示愤慨，他们说：假如再有类似情事发生，他们就要抓英国人当人质。
    【新华社三日讯】电通社特拉维夫消息：以色列共产党政治局在十月三十日公布的关于埃及的决议中声明：埃及人民争取解放的斗争是“正义的斗争，并且是符合中东各国人民的利益的”。
    决议说：从德黑兰到开罗，只有一小撮战争贩子和各国人民的压迫者，那就是英、美帝国主义者。埃及人民已在不断举行的反对英、美帝国主义、要求和苏联友好的群众示威游行中，表示了要进行坚决斗争以获得解放的决心，因而加强了中东各国人民的争取解放的斗争。以色列所有爱好自由和平的人民都欢迎这个斗争，并向埃及人民致敬。以色列人民痛恨帝国主义武装干预埃及人民的内政。
    决议号召以色列人民举行更多的示威游行，声援埃及人民的反帝斗争和为保卫和平而斗争的中东各国人民。
