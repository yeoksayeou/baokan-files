Improve Brick Quality, Save National Resources
Zhang Qingming, Wang Jing

This year, construction projects in Beijing have increased rapidly, and the supply of brick kiln products cannot meet the demand. Many public and private brick kiln factories, simply pursuing excessive profits, neglect quality, cut corners, and produce substandard products, which seriously affects the solidity of construction projects and causes great losses to national resources. People from all walks of life in Beijing have put forward many proposals at previous People's Representative Conferences, requesting the government to strictly manage brick kilns. In order to thoroughly correct this undesirable phenomenon, the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, leading the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Construction Bureau, China Building Materials Company, and Kiln Industry Association, together with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, formed a working group to conduct a general inspection of public and private kiln factories throughout the city. This inspection has already attracted the attention of various brick kiln factories, initially improving product quality and strengthening the planning of production and sales. Now, based on the specific situation, the "Beijing Municipal Brick Kiln Industry Mechanism, Temporary Operating Procedures for Hand-Made Bricks," and "Standard Specifications for Mechanism-Made and Hand-Made Bricks" have been formulated.

Before liberation, there were only over twenty brick kilns in Beijing; this number surged to one hundred and thirty-five in the first half of this year. Because bricks and tiles sell well and are profitable (general profits are around 50%, some reaching 80%), many people switched to the kiln industry, believing that "you can make money by burning bricks if you have a kiln." Some people don't care about the quality of the soil when choosing a factory site, and some blindly construct kilns without design. The large kiln of the private Wanhe Kiln Factory cracked significantly just after it was built. The public-owned Yongmao Company's Northern Suburb Brick Factory blindly built kilns without selecting soil, resulting in soil that was fundamentally unsuitable for brick making, requiring a new plan and wasting a lot of manpower and resources. The product quality of most kiln factories is deteriorating day by day. Some bricks are called "self-crisping," "hand-crisping," or "landing-crisping." Not only is the quality of the bricks poor, but the specifications are also inconsistent. The Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau inspected forty-eight four-inch bricks produced by thirty-seven brick kilns from March to June this year. The results showed that some bricks weighed 3.23 kilograms, while others weighed only 1.93 kilograms, a difference of more than one kilogram. The compressive strength was 158 kilograms per square centimeter for some, and only 80 kilograms for others, a difference of almost double. The length, width, and thickness of each brick also varied greatly. These bricks of different quality and specifications (commonly called "patterned bricks") will certainly not be suitable when used in the same building. No matter how skilled the workers are, they can only "make it even with mud," which will inevitably affect the solidity of the building.

The situation of kiln factories cutting corners and producing substandard products is even more serious. In the city's kiln factories, many use topsoil to make blanks. They do not soak the mud when making blanks and do not use trowels. They load the kiln before the blanks are dry. The firing and cooling time is also insufficient: for example, a horseshoe kiln that loads 100,000 blanks should be fired for about 20 days, but some only fire for 13 days; it should be cooled for about 17 days, but some only cool for 7 days. The amount of coal used per 10,000 bricks (using Kailuan No. 2 coal as the standard) should be 6 tons, but some only use 4 tons. Such cutting corners greatly reduces the compressive strength and flexural strength of the bricks.

The main reason for the poor quality of bricks is that various brick kiln factories, construction companies, and construction factories do not pay enough attention to national interests. Construction companies and construction factories undertake projects, covet high profits, and purchase inferior bricks. The current inventory of various kiln factories has been completely snapped up. The bad bricks that the Xinjing Kiln Factory could not sell in 1950 were quickly sold out this spring. The red four-inch bricks produced by the Wanhe Kiln Factory this year contained a large amount of slurry stone and were of very poor quality, but they were also all sold out. This has further fueled the bad habit of brick kiln factories cutting corners. Many public kiln factories also only pursue production figures, regardless of quality. The Southern Suburb New Kiln Factory transported soil containing a large amount of slurry stone to the soil pile, resulting in bricks that cracked after exposure to wind and rain. The director of the New Brick Kiln General Factory also said: "I think the quality of the bricks is also terrible, but people want them, so what can I do?" The bricks burned by the Eastern Suburb Civilian Kiln are broken and incomplete, scattered in piles here and there, resulting in huge losses and serious waste of state property. The situation of private kiln factories cutting corners is even more serious than that of public ones. For example, the private Xinhua Kiln has a lot of slurry stone and carbon slag in the blanks, and the firing and cooling days are insufficient. The bricks burned are "crisp" and "broken," with all kinds of problems, not looking like bricks at all. It is very dangerous to build houses with this kind of brick.

Government authorities such as the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Construction Bureau lack the necessary management of brick kilns. In the past, there were no unified regulations on quality specifications, manufacturing procedures, production and sales plans, and reasonable prices. The trade union organization of the kiln industry is unsound, and the trade union's education of kiln workers is insufficient. Therefore, workers do not actively propose suggestions to the factory to overcome substandard production with the attitude of being masters of the country.

After the working group conducted a general inspection and called for attention to quality, the brick quality of most public kiln factories has been initially improved. The Xinghua Rongjun Kiln Factory adjusted the soil quality, modified the machine furnace mouth, and mobilized workers to study technology, formulating a unified manufacturing procedure and standard specifications for quality. Administrative leaders regard improving quality as the central task, and workers include "guaranteeing and improving quality" in their patriotic covenants. Each team put forward specific action slogans, and as a result, the number of first-class blanks increased from 20% to 75%. The director of the Southern Suburb New Kiln Factory personally went to the construction site to inspect and strictly prohibited the use of soil containing slurry stone. The burned bricks no longer crack. Victory No. 1 Factory formulated a plan to improve quality and established a technical improvement team. The red bricks produced now no longer crack. The Northern Tonghe Kiln Factory improved the mud mixing operation method. Many kiln factories have replaced unqualified blank buckets.

In order to better improve the quality of bricks and ensure the safety of buildings, the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has instructed the relevant departments to pay attention to the following issues:

(1) Strengthen the management of brick kilns. Strictly review new businesses and establish new kilns based on the conditions of the overall urban plan, soil reserve, and other conditions. Existing earthen kilns (horseshoe kilns, constricted kilns) should be prohibited from burning red bricks to ensure quality. Kiln factories with danger should be ordered to improve or demolish them within a time limit.

(2) Strengthen the planning of brick production and sales and unify quality specifications. Stipulate reasonable prices and allocate them uniformly. This can overcome blind production and sales, eliminate substandard production and malicious buying, and other undesirable phenomena.

(3) All kiln factories must comply with the brick-making procedures and quality specification standards promulgated by the government. Bricks that do not meet the standards will not be taxed and are prohibited from being sold. In the future, kiln factories that produce bricks of too poor quality and seek exorbitant profits should be given appropriate punishment.

(4) Work with the trade union to conduct patriotic education for workers so that every worker can realize that guaranteeing and improving the quality of bricks is to reduce the waste of national resources.

    提高砖瓦质量，节省国家资财
    张庆明　王敬
    今年北京的建筑工程迅速增加，砖窑产品供不应求。很多公营和私营砖窑厂，单纯追逐过高利润，忽视质量、偷工减料、粗制滥造，严重地影响了建筑工程的坚固，并造成国家资财的很大损失。北京市各界人民在历次各界人民代表会议上，曾经提出很多提案，请政府严格管理砖窑。北京市财政经济委员会为了彻底纠正这种不良现象，领导工商局、建设局、中国建筑器材公司、窑业公会等单位，会同市总工会，组成工作组，普遍检查全市的公私营窑厂。这次检查，已引起各砖窑厂的注意，初步提高了产品质量，加强了产销的计划性。现在更根据具体情况，制订了北京市砖窑业机制、手制砖暂行操作规程，及机制、手制砖的标准规格。
    北京市的砖窑，在解放以前仅有二十多户，今年上半年骤增至一百三十五户。因为砖瓦畅销利大（一般利润在百分之五十左右，有的达到百分之八十），很多人转营窑业，认为“有窑烧砖就能赚钱”。有些人选择厂址时不管土质好坏，有些人建窑时不经设计就盲目施工。私营万合窑厂大窑刚刚建成，窑帮就裂了大缝。公营永茂公司北郊砖厂不择土质，盲目建窑，结果土质根本不能制砖，还得从新计划，浪费了不少人力和财力。大多数窑厂的产品质量，一天比一天低劣。有的砖被人称为“自来酥”“一把酥”“落地酥”。砖的质量不但低劣，规格还不统一。北京市建设局曾在今年三月到六月检验了三十七户砖窑出产的四十八块四丁砖。结果：有的砖重三点二三公斤，有的砖只重一点九三公斤，相差一公斤多。抗压力一平方公分有的是一百五十八公斤，有的只八十公斤，相差几乎一倍。各个砖的长、宽、厚度，也都相差很多。这些不同质量、不同规格的砖（通称花砖）用在同一个建筑物上，当然不会合适。任凭工人技术多么巧，也只好是“齐不齐，一把泥”，这怎么会不影响建筑物的坚固呢？
    各砖窑厂偷工减料、粗制滥造的情况更是严重。在全市窑厂中，有很多窑厂用浮土制坯。制坯的时候不泡泥，不走抹子。坯子不干就装窑。烧窑淋窑的时间也不够：如装十万坯子的马蹄窑，应该烧二十天左右，但有的只烧十三天；应该淋十七天左右，有的才淋七天，每万块砖的烧煤量（以开滦二号煤为标准）应用六吨，有的只用四吨。这样偷工减料，使砖的抗压力和挠屈强度，大大降低了。
    砖质低劣的主要原因，是各砖窑厂、建筑公司、营造厂对国家利益重视不够。建筑公司和营造厂承揽工程，贪图厚利，购买次砖。各窑厂现货都被收购一空。新京窑厂在一九五○年卖不出去的坏砖，今年春天很快就卖光了。万合窑厂今年生产的红四丁砖，含有大量浆石，质量很坏，但也全部卖清了。这就更加助长了砖窑厂的偷工减料的恶劣风气。许多公营窑厂也只是追求生产数字，不管质量高低。南郊新建窑厂把含有大量浆石的土，运到土堆里，结果烧成的砖，一经风雨，就爆裂了。新建砖窑总厂厂长还说：“我看砖的质量也不像话，可就是有人要，这有什么办法呢？”东郊民用窑烧成的砖，破烂残缺，东一堆、西一堆，损失浩大，严重地浪费了国家财产。私营窑厂偷工减料的情况，比公营更为严重。例如私营新华窑，土坯里浆石、炭渣很多，烧窑、淋窑的日子又不够，烧出来的砖“又酥”又“破”，各种毛病都有，不像个砖的样子。用这种砖来盖房，是十分危险的。
    政府主管机关如工商局、建设局等，对砖窑缺乏必要的管理。像质量规格、制造程序、产销计划、合理价格等，过去都没有统一的规定。窑业的工会组织不健全，工会对窑业工人的教育不够，因此，工人也没有以国家主人翁的态度，积极向厂方提出克服粗制滥造的意见。
    经过工作组普遍检查并号召重视质量以后，大多数公营窑厂的砖质，已经初步改进了。兴华荣军窑厂调配了土质，改装了机器龙口，并发动工人钻研技术，拟定了统一制造的程序和标准规格质量。行政领导干部把提高质量作为中心工作，工人把“保证提高质量”订入爱国公约中，各小组都提出了具体行动口号，结果一等坯子由百分之二十，增到百分之七十五。南郊新建窑厂厂长亲自到工地去检查，一律不准用含有浆石的土。烧成的砖已经不爆裂了。胜利一厂制订了一个改进质量的计划，并成立了技术改进组。现在所产的红砖已不爆裂。北同合窑厂改进了打泥的操作方法。许多窑厂都换掉了不合标准的坯斗子。
    为了更好地提高砖的质量，保证建筑物的安全，北京市财政经济委员会已指示各有关主管部门注意下面几个问题：
        （一）加强砖窑管理。对新开业户严格审查，应根据整个都市计划土质蕴藏量等条件，建立新窑。现有的土窑（马蹄窑、缩口窑）应该禁止烧红砖，以保证质量。对有危险的窑厂，应限期改进或拆除。
        （二）加强砖的产销计划性和统一质量规格。规定合理的价格，统一调配。这样可以克服盲目的产销，消灭粗制滥造和争购等不良现象。
        （三）各窑厂必须遵守政府公布的制砖程序和质量规格标准。对于不合标准的砖，不予完税，禁止出售。以后对砖质太坏、牟取暴利的窑厂，应该给以适当的处罚。
        （四）会同工会对工人进行爱国主义教育，使每个工人都能认识到保证和提高砖的质量，就是减少国家资财的浪费。
