Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 6)
　　Lǚ Shūxiāng, Zhū Déxī
　　　　Third Section: Semicolons
    The function of a semicolon. A semicolon indicates a larger pause within a sentence, especially between parallel clauses (or longer phrases). For example:
    (1) What the German people hope to restore is not the "Wehrmacht" generals, but their own good reputation; what they hope to restore is not the SS, but the honest and peaceful laborers of Germany; what they hope to restore is not the Sturmabteilung divisions, but their cities, schools, libraries, and museums. (Newspaper)
    (2) Concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact means world peace and security; not concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact means the world remains divided and opposed, breeding the crisis of war. (Newspaper)
    (3) Thereafter, Britain and the United States established the North Atlantic nation group; among the major countries that formed the anti-Hitler alliance, only the Soviet Union was not included as a signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty. (Newspaper)
    (4) Everyone looks at him, and he looks at everyone; he knows that only in this way can he reduce the villagers' suspicion. (Lao She)
    (5) But in our shop, his conduct is better than anyone else's, that is, he never defaults; although he occasionally doesn't have cash and it's temporarily recorded on the blackboard, he always pays it off within a month, wiping Kong Yiji's name off the blackboard. (Lu)
    These five sentences can almost summarize the usage of semicolons. (1) is obviously three parallel clauses, (2) is two parallel clauses, one positive and one negative, and (3) is two clauses that complement each other. Although the structure is not parallel, the meanings are parallel. In (4) and (5), neither the structure nor the meaning is parallel, but there is a relatively large pause; a comma is not enough to separate the two paragraphs above and below, and a period would break a coherent sentence into two, so a semicolon is most appropriate.
    Semicolon or period? Some parallel sentences are closely related in meaning and should be connected with a semicolon, not broken apart with a period. For example:
    (6) During the day, the soldiers resolutely held the positions they had gained. At night, the soldiers launched new and relentless attacks on the enemy. (Book)
    (7) Currently, among the students living on campus at Peking University in the Faculties of Arts, Law, and Science, there are more than sixty who have tuberculosis and are housed in isolation. Among the new students who enrolled last year, eleven more have now been found to have contracted tuberculosis. More than ten students in the Faculty of Engineering also have tuberculosis. (Newspaper)
    Conversely, situations where a period should have been used but a semicolon was used, such as:
    (8) The hospital never pays attention to infant illnesses, resulting in most of the infants already suffering from lung diseases or skin sores; orphans over the age of three are very weak due to long-term consumption of only rice soup, pickled vegetables, and vegetable roots, with those suffering from lung diseases accounting for 20%; orphans over the age of eight have to engage in heavy labor such as husking rice, carrying water, weaving cloth, and growing vegetables, seriously hindering their normal physical development; the orphans in the orphanage have no personal freedom, and the marriage of adult girls or their retention as Daoist nuns is entirely decided by He Ruowang. (Newspaper)
    Of these four clauses, the first three are all about the health of the children in the orphanage, and the last one is about their personal freedom, so it is best to separate them. The third semicolon should be changed to a period.
    Semicolon or comma? The difference between a semicolon and a period is not difficult to grasp, but the difference between a semicolon and a comma is more difficult to grasp—at least as far as what we see now. It is often seen that these two symbols are used inappropriately, this one being used as that one, and that one being used as this one, mainly because people stubbornly cling to the phrase "semicolons separate parallel clauses." Thus, on the one hand, there are:
    (9) For example, the sand casting group cast a "large belt pulley" with a diameter of 5.2 feet; a width of 14 inches; and a weight of 750 jin in 144 hours. (Manuscript)
    (10) Comrade Bishi had three fears in his life: one was fear of having too little work; two was fear of troubling others; and three was fear of spending too much money. (Periodical)
    (11) The Central Ministry of Education, at the recent preparatory meeting of the Secondary Education Conference, discussed this issue as a special issue; and will further study concrete and feasible specific measures. (Newspaper)
    (12) The World Peace Council's appeal to "ban atomic weapons; and declare the government that first uses these weapons as a war criminal" has received widespread response from the people of various countries. (Newspaper)
    Although there are parallel clauses or phrases here, they are not very long, and a comma is sufficient, without the need for a semicolon. (12) can also use a enumeration comma or no punctuation at all.
    On the other hand, there are also:
    (13) The public canteen is spacious and clean, the bowls and chopsticks are a fixed set, and after use, they are put into a specially made small box. Three meals a day, with rice and meat once or twice a week, and each person only pays 1,400 to 1,500 yuan in food expenses per month. (Newspaper)
    (14) The carnival celebrating the birth of the motherland did not diminish until the evening of the second day. Every square, park, and club was crowded with revelers. In Labor Park alone, there were 50,000 to 60,000 people playing there at the same time. Colorful fireworks danced in the night sky, illuminating the cheering crowds. Many people were watching operas, many people were singing, and even more people were surrounding clusters of Yangko teams. (Newspaper)
    (13) can clearly be divided into two parts, the first part describing the cleanliness of the canteen and the second part describing its affordability and good quality. A semicolon should be used after "small box." (14) can be divided into three parts, the first part describing the duration, the second part describing the number of visitors in various places, and the third part providing a concrete description of people's activities. A semicolon should be used after "diminish" and "50,000 to 60,000 people." If periods are used in these places, dividing (13) into two sentences and (14) into two or three sentences, there would be nothing wrong with it. If the author feels that they should be merged, then only a semicolon can be used to clarify the levels.
    Because the parts separated by semicolons often have one or more commas inside, some people mechanically understand that a semicolon should be used after several commas have been used, so there are also examples like this:
    (15) Although the government made great efforts to provide disaster relief during the floods, and later set up many shelters to accommodate compatriots from the disaster areas; however, small difficulties may still exist, and we hope that you will not bow your heads in the face of difficulties; you must think of various ways to overcome all the difficulties that exist before you. (Newspaper)
    Clauses connected with "although" and "but," "because" and "so," and "if," "even if," etc., are quite closely related and should generally only be separated by commas unless there are special circumstances. The same is true between "Don't..." and "Do..." (compare with Example 1's "not...but..."). Therefore, the two semicolons in this sentence are misused and should be changed to commas. There is no need for a comma after "but," and a period should be used after "exist."
    Period, comma, semicolon. These three are all general punctuation marks indicating pauses. Which symbol should be used in a particular place must be considered in terms of both structure and meaning, and must not be viewed mechanically. Here are some examples worth discussing:
    (16) But rich people are not like cows, the more you milk them, the harder it is to get milk. (Newspaper)
    (17) You must have a meaning to have something to say. If you have no meaning and insist on saying something, it is nonsense. If you haven't thought about the meaning clearly and just say it casually, it is亂說, then you have not spoken well. (Book)
    (16) Three clauses, divided into two segments, are all very simple, and it seems that a comma in the middle would be enough. But this sentence is ambiguous: does "the more you milk them, the harder it is to get milk" refer to cows or rich people? (Compare "Flour is not like rice, you can cook it by boiling it with water.") If the first comma is changed to a semicolon, there will be no misunderstanding. (Another way to change it is to change "not like cows" to "not the same as cows.")
    (17) Although the several clauses are short, the meaning of the whole sentence is layered, and using five commas in a row does not express it. This sentence can consider changing the first and fifth commas to periods and the third comma to a semicolon.
    (18) All nationalities, regardless of size, enjoy the same rights. The government always persuades them to reconcile and cooperate in any disputes between nationalities and within nationalities; it never adopts the divisive and provocative tactics of past imperialists and reactionary rulers, nor does it support one while suppressing the other. (Newspaper)
    (19) He pointed out: This session further expanded the democratic basis, on the one hand, it is manifested in the way representatives are produced; on the other hand, it is manifested in the number of people, the number of representatives, consultative committee members, and government committee members has increased compared with the previous two sessions. (Newspaper)
    (18) Speaks of two things: first, equality of rights between nationalities; second, peaceful coexistence between nationalities and within nationalities. According to this, a semicolon (or period) should be used under "rights," and a comma should be used under "cooperation." (19) There is nothing wrong with using a semicolon between "on the one hand..." and "on the other hand...," but the preceding "expanded the democratic basis" is a general statement, and only a comma is used below, so the semicolon below seems a bit inappropriate. This semicolon can be changed to a comma, or the previous comma can be changed to a period, and the word "this" can be added before "on the one hand."

    语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
  　吕叔湘、朱德熙
        第三段分号
    分号的作用。分号表示句子内部比较大些的停顿，尤其是用在并列的分句（或较长的短语）之间。例如：
    （一）德国人民所希望恢复的不是“国防军”将领，而是他们自己的好名声；他们所希望恢复的不是党卫军，而是德国正直而和平的劳动者；他们所希望恢复的不是冲锋队的师团，而是他们的城市，学校，图书馆和博物馆。（报）
    （二）缔结五大国和平公约，就意味着世界和平与安全；不缔结五大国和平公约，则世界仍处于分裂对立，就孕育着战争危机。（报）
    （三）此后，英国与美国就建立了北大西洋国家集团；在组成反希特勒同盟的各大国中，只有苏联没有被列入作为北大西洋公约的缔约国。（报）
    （四）大家看他，他也看大家；他知道只有这样才足以减少村人的怀疑。（老舍）
    （五）但他在我们店里，品行却比别人都好，就是从不拖欠；虽然间或没有现钱，暂时记在粉板上，但不出一月，定然还清，从粉板上拭去了孔乙己的名字。（鲁）这五句差不多可以概括分号的用法。（一）是很明显的三个并列子句，（二）是一正一反的两个并列子句，（三）是两个互相补充的子句，结构虽然不平行，意思是并列的。（四）和（五），论结构，论意思，都不是并列的，但是都有一个比较大的停顿；用逗号不足以分别上下两个段落，用句号又嫌把意思连贯的一句拆成两句，最适当的是分号。
    分号还是句号？有些并列的句子，意思密切关联，应该用分号连接，不应该用句号拆开。例如：
    （六）白天，战士们坚决守住已得的阵地。夜里，战士们向敌人进行新的、无情的攻击。（书）
    （七）目前北大住校的文、法、理三院同学中，有肺病而被隔离住宿的有六十余人。在去年入学的新同学中，现在又发现有十一人已染肺病。工学院同学有肺病的也有十余人。（报）相反的情形，应该用句号而用了分号的，如：
    （八）院方对婴儿疾病从不注意，以致大多数的婴孩已患肺病或染有疮疾；三岁以上的孤儿由于长期只吃米汤、腌菜、菜根，身体都很羸弱，患肺病的占百分之二十；八岁以上的孤儿就要从事砻谷、挑水、织布、种菜等繁重劳动，严重地妨碍了身体的正常发育；院内孤儿们都没有人身自由，成年女孩出嫁或留作道女，完全由和若望决定。（报）这里的四个分句，前三句都关于孤儿院内儿童健康情况，最后一句关于他们的人身自由，最好是分开。第三个分号应改为句号。
    分号还是逗号？分号和句号的区别不难把握，较难把握的是分号和逗号的区别——至少照现在看见的情形说是如此。现在常常看见这两种符号用的不恰当，这个用成那个，那个用成这个，主要是因为死守住“分号隔开并列的分句”这句话。于是，一方面有：
    （九）如翻砂组以一四四个小时，铸成了一个直径五·二呎；宽一四吋；重七五○市斤的“大皮带轮”。（稿）
    （十）弼时同志一生有三怕：一怕工作少；二怕麻烦人；三怕用钱多。（期）
    （十一）中央教育部在最近召开的中等教育会议预备会上，把这一问题作为一个专门问题加以讨论；并将进一步研究切实可行的具体办法。（报）
    （十二）世界和大常委会发出的“禁用原子武器；并宣布首先使用这武器的政府为战犯”的呼吁书，已得到各国人民广泛的响应。（报）这里虽然有并列的分句或短语，都不很长，用逗号已经足够，无须用分号。 （十二）还可以用顿号或不用任何符号。
    另一方面，又有：
    （十三）公共食堂宽大清洁，碗筷都是固定的一份，用过后就装入特制的小箱，一日三餐，每周吃一两次大米和肉，每人每月只缴一千四五百元的饭费。（报）
    （十四）庆祝祖国诞生的狂欢，直到第二日晚，犹未稍减，各个广场、公园、俱乐部都挤满了狂欢的人群，仅劳动公园一处同时在那里游玩的即达五、六万人，五彩的焰火在夜空飞舞，照耀着欢腾的人群，许多人在看戏，许多人在唱歌，有更多的人包围着一簇簇的秧歌队。（报）
    （十三）显然分得出两个部分，前一部分说食堂清洁，后一部分说价廉物美。应该在“小箱”之后用分号。（十四）分得出三个部分，第一部分说时间之久，第二部分说各处游人之多，第三个部分具体描写人们的活动。应该在“稍减”和“五、六万人”之后用分号。如果这些地方用句号，把（十三）分成两句，（十四）分成两句或三句，也没有什么不可以。如果作者觉得应该合并，那就只有用分号，才能分清层次。
    因为用分号隔开的几部分的内部常常有一个或不止一个逗号，有人就机械地去理解，认为用过几个逗号之后就该用个分号，于是又有这种例子：
    （十五）虽然政府在洪水泛滥时期，曾经大力抢救，以后又设了许多收容所，收容灾区同胞；但是，小的困难可能还会有，希望你们不要在困难面前低头；要想各种办法，克服眼前所存在的一切困难。（报）凡是用“虽然”和“但是”、“因为”和“所以”、以及“如果”“即使”等等连接的分句，都关联得相当紧，除非有特别情况，一般只能用逗号隔开。“不要……”和“要……”之间也是如此（比较例一的“不是……而是……”）。所以这一句里的两个分号都用错了，应该改成逗号。“但是”之后无须逗号，“会有”之后宜用句号。
    句号、逗号、分号。这三种都是一般性的停顿符号，某一处应该用哪一个符号要在结构和意义双方考虑，切不可机械地去看。下面是几个值得讨论的例子：
    （十六）但是有钱的人并不和奶牛一样，越向他多挤，就越难挤出。（报）
    （十七）要有意思才有话说，没有意思硬要说，就是瞎说，意思没有想清楚随便说，就是乱说，那都是话没有说好。（书）
    （十六）三个分句，分两段，都很简单，似乎中间用个逗号也够了。可是这句话有歧义：“越向他多挤，就越难挤出”，是指乳牛呢？还是指有钱的人呢？（比较“面粉并不和大米一样，加水一煮就能吃”。）如果第一个逗号改做分号，就不会有误会了。（还有一个改法是把“并不和奶牛一样”改做“和奶牛不一样”。）（十七）的几个分句虽然都短，全句的意思是有层次的，一连用五个逗号就表示不出。这一句可以考虑把第一个和第五个逗号改句号，第三个改做分号。
    （十八）民族无论大小都享受到同一的权利，民族间的以及民族内部的任何纠纷，政府一律劝导他们和解、合作；决不采取过去帝国主义和反动统治者的离间挑拨及扶此抑彼的手段。（报）
    （十九）他指出：这一届会议进一步扩大了民主基础，一方面表现在代表产生的方式上；另一方面表现在人数上，代表、协商委员、政
        府委员的人数都比前两届增加了。（报）
    （十八）说及两件事情：一，民族间权利平等；二，民族间及民族内和平相处。依照这个，“权利”底下应该用分号（或句号），“合作”底下应该用逗号。（十九）在“一方面……”和“另一方面……”之间用分号，本来没有什么不可以，但是前面的“扩大了民主基础”是总说，底下只用一个逗号，下面的分号就显得有点不合适了。可以把这个分号改做逗号，也可以把前面的逗号改做句号，在“一方面”之前加个“这”字。
                    （本段完，全文未完）
