    Resolutely Struggle Against Corruption
    Generally speaking, the staff of our people's governments at all levels are honest. They are doing revolutionary work, and many cadres have been tested by long-term revolutionary struggles, living a supply-based life. They are not corrupt and have maintained a glorious tradition, forming the backbone of the People's Republic of China. When the People's Republic of China was founded, Article 18 of the Common Program clearly stipulated: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must practice a revolutionary working style of integrity, simplicity, and service to the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic working style of being divorced from the masses of the people." Article 42 stipulated that cherishing public property is one of the public virtues of all citizens of the People's Republic of China. For more than two years, people's governments at all levels have continuously carried out the struggle against corruption, severely punished corrupt elements, and established a revolutionary working style of integrity and public service among all state employees throughout the country, eliminating the corrupt practices of the old society. This achievement is very significant.
    However, we must not ignore that after the national revolutionary victory, many staff members of the old military and political organs transferred to the people's government organs to participate in various aspects of work. Although most of them have gradually established the idea of serving the people through education and transformation and have begun to overcome the corrupt practices brought from the old bureaucratic organs, some people have been poorly reformed or have not been reformed at all, inheriting the corrupt practices of the Kuomintang reactionaries, using various opportunities to steal the property of the state and the people for their own benefit. Judging from the corruption cases that have been discovered in the past, they accounted for 99 percent of the total number of corrupt people. On the other hand, some personnel who have participated in the revolution for a long time have failed to completely overcome the idea of corruption due to their poor political qualities. After entering the city, they were influenced by the bad habits left by imperialists, feudal bureaucrats, and Kuomintang reactionaries, so they quickly degenerated, took bribes and perverted justice, engaged in malpractice for personal gain, and became pests in the people's revolutionary cause. This is the basic reason why there are still a few cases of corruption in our New Democratic country.
    Two or three months ago, the Northeast People's Government noticed this intolerable phenomenon and launched a region-wide anti-corruption struggle. On August 31, Comrade Gao Gang profoundly and sharply criticized corruption and bureaucratic working styles at a meeting of cadres directly under the Northeast Bureau. Comrade Gao Gang called on all organs and departments in the Northeast to launch a struggle against corruption and degeneration and against bureaucracy. According to the instructions of Comrade Gao Gang, since September, the movement against corruption and degeneration and against bureaucracy has been launched successively in the first-level organs and provinces and cities in Northeast China, and has developed into a democratic movement with leadership. In this movement, various acts of corruption and degeneration were exposed and attacked, greatly improving the awareness of cadres and the masses, strengthening and enhancing their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for cherishing state property, so that corruption was greatly reduced and the expenditures of organs were greatly reduced. This has deeply moved many cadres who have just started working, changed their past thinking of "not seeing what is a new society and what is an old society," recognized that the measures of the Communist Party and the People's Government are "things that have never happened in history," and joyfully saw that "China has a promising future and unlimited prospects."
    Judging from the corruption cases discovered in the Northeast and other regions, corruption is more serious in economic work departments. For example, in the first stage of the anti-corruption struggle in Shenyang City, the various professional companies and other units of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce alone exposed, criticized, and initially dealt with 3,629 people with varying degrees of corruption. In the East China region, Lu Xingyuan, director of the engineering office of the East China and Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station alone, embezzled more than 247 million yuan. In North China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China, a number of corruption cases have also been continuously exposed and dealt with recently. For example, the Shanxi Provincial People's Court sentenced Feng Jingquan, a warehouse director, for corruption; the Jiangxi Provincial People's Court sentenced Liu Xiji and others from the Nanchang Municipal Taxation Bureau for corruption; the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate reported the corruption case of Xiao Ziyan and 24 others, which has been sentenced by the Chongqing Municipal People's Court; and the Xi'an Municipal People's Court sentenced the collective corruption case of Qi Fengrui, an accountant from the former Northwest Military Region Logistics Department Grain and Forage Department. From here, we can see that the serious ideological struggle against corruption must be carried out to the end. However, it is worth noting that this struggle has not yet attracted the participation of the broad masses, and some places still regard it only as the work of certain specialized organs. This is obviously completely wrong. We have now seen that many corrupt elements have completely degenerated into thieves who steal state and people's property. What they care about is only how to use their positions to steal the property of the state and the people, and there is no longer any atmosphere of revolutionary workers. The damage they have caused to the cause of national construction is incalculable. However, many places have not yet seriously launched a mass anti-corruption struggle. After all, the corruption incidents that have been exposed so far are only a part, and there must still be a considerable number of corruption incidents that have not been exposed throughout the country. Can this be complacent?
    Now, our people across the country are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's instructions at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and carrying out a campaign to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Opposing corruption and waste is an inseparable part of the movement to increase production and practice economy. All parts of the country should refer to the experience of the Northeast region, vigorously carry out the anti-corruption struggle, and strive to eradicate this criminal phenomenon that seriously damages the interests of the state and the people.
    According to the experience of the Northeast region, to persist in the anti-corruption struggle, first, a mass democratic movement must be launched. To this end, all Party and non-Party masses should be absorbed to participate in this movement. The significance of the movement should be repeatedly explained to everyone, and they should be organized to study relevant documents, conduct full deliberation, and continuously improve their awareness. Second, the chief should be responsible, personally lead, and conduct sincere and profound self-criticism of the main shortcomings of the unit. If it is not done well once, it will be done a second time until the masses are truly mobilized. Third, emphasis must be placed on ideological leadership. Because the anti-corruption struggle is a complex and acute struggle. People who have corrupt acts often use various methods to resist or evade the struggle at the beginning of the movement. Therefore, leaders must support the masses, strengthen ideological leadership, and give explanations to address the various concerns of the masses in order to improve the enthusiasm of the masses. Corrupt elements do not confess because they are afraid of losing face, returning stolen goods, being dismissed, and being prosecuted. The masses dare not boldly report them because they are afraid of offending people, afraid that the movement is just a gust of wind and will pass, and that they will be retaliated against and attacked in the future. Experience has proved that at the beginning of the movement, the masses often dare not publicly report, but adopt the method of secret reporting; the responsible personnel of the people's government must seriously deal with this kind of secret reporting to encourage the masses to boldly expose corruption incidents. Fourth, problems that have been clarified must be dealt with in a timely manner. Those who are corrupt and voluntarily confess can be given leniency in their punishment; small acts of corruption, after confession and clarification of the situation, can be announced in public this time without punishment, and if they commit the crime again in the future, the punishment will be increased. This can stabilize those who have already confessed, promote those who have concerns to confess quickly, and facilitate winning over the masses and isolating the worst elements. Fifth, with the deepening and development of the movement, the awareness of the masses is gradually improved, and the leading organs should promptly put forward new instructions and summarize experience to promote the continued progress of the movement. Sixth, each unit should form an inspection team composed of a group of strong cadres as an assistant to the leadership, conduct in-depth inspections, promptly reflect the situation, and assist the leading organs in summarizing experience and guiding the movement.
    The experience of the Northeast region in the struggle against corruption and degeneration and against bureaucracy proves that the biggest enemies of the movement to increase production and practice economy are corruption and waste and bureaucracy. If corruption and waste cannot be eliminated, not only will it ruin the future of some cadres, but it will also hinder the accumulation of funds and hinder the consolidation of the new democratic system. Therefore, all parts of the country should quickly take action and launch a resolute struggle against corruption to completely eliminate all corruption.

### 向贪污行为作坚决斗争

    向贪污行为作坚决斗争
    一般地说来，我们各级人民政府的工作人员是廉洁的，他们做的是革命的工作，有许多干部还经过了长期的革命斗争的考验，过着供给制的生活。他们不贪污，不腐化，保持了光荣的传统，构成了中华人民共和国的骨干。中华人民共和国成立的时候，在共同纲领第十八条中明文规定：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”并在第四十二条中，规定爱护公共财物为中华人民共和国全体国民的公德之一。各级人民政府两年多以来不断进行了反贪污的斗争，严惩了贪污分子，在全国范围内、在国家全体工作人员中，树立了廉洁奉公的革命作风，扫除了旧社会中贪污腐化的恶习。这个成绩是十分显著的。
    但是，我们决不能忽视，在全国革命胜利后，有许多旧的军政机关的工作人员，转到人民的政府机关中参加各方面的工作。他们中的大多数人虽然经过了教育改造而逐渐树立了为人民服务的思想，开始克服了从旧的官僚机关中带来的贪污腐化作风；但是究竟还有一些人改造得很差，甚至根本没有什么改造，而承袭着国民党反动派的贪污作风，利用各种机会，盗窃国家和人民的财产以自肥。从过去已经发现的贪污案件来看，他们占了全部贪污人数的百分之九十九。另一方面，也有一些参加革命较久的人员，因其政治品质恶劣，未能在长期的革命斗争中彻底克服贪污腐化思想；进入城市后，又接受了帝国主义者、封建官僚、国民党反动派所遗留的恶习的影响，于是迅速堕落，贪赃枉法，营私舞弊，成为人民革命事业中的害虫。这就是为什么在我们新民主主义的国家中，仍然存在着少数贪污现象的基本原因。
    在两三个月前，东北人民政府就注意了这种不可容忍的现象，并展开了全区规模的反贪污斗争。八月三十一日，高岗同志在东北局各直属机关干部会上，深刻而尖锐地批判了贪污腐化现象和官僚主义作风。高岗同志号召东北各个机关和各个部门，展开反对贪污腐化和反对官僚主义的斗争。根据高岗同志的指示，从九月份以来，反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义的运动即先后在东北一级各机关和各省、市开展起来，并发展成为有领导的民主运动。在这一运动中，揭发和打击了各种贪污蜕化行为，大大地提高了干部、群众的觉悟水平，加强和提高了他们爱护国家财产的责任心和积极性，因而贪污现象大为减少，机关开支大为紧缩。这就使许多参加工作不久的干部深受感动，改变了过去“看不出什么是新社会，什么是旧社会”的思想，认识了共产党和人民政府的措施是“历史上从来没有的事情”，欣喜地看到“中国真是前途远大，无限光明”。
    从东北以及其他地区所发现的贪污事件来看，贪污现象在经济工作部门内是比较严重的。例如沈阳市在反贪污斗争的第一阶段，仅工商局各专业公司及其他单位，即揭发、批判并初步处理了三千六百二十九人的程度不一的贪污行为。在华东地区，仅华东、上海人民广播电台工务室主任路星元一人，即贪污达二亿四千七百多万元。在华北、中南、西南、西北各区，最近也曾连续揭发和处理了若干贪污事件。如山西省人民法院判决了一个仓库主任冯境权的贪污案件；江西省人民法院判决了南昌市税务局刘锡骥等的贪污案件；最高人民检察署西南分署检举了萧子言等二十四人的贪污案件，并已由重庆市人民法院予以判决；西安市人民法院判决了前西北军区后勤部粮秣处会计祁丰瑞等集体贪污案。从这里，我们可以看到，反贪污的严重的思想斗争必须进行到底。但是值得注意的是这个斗争现在还没有吸引广大群众来参加，有的地方还只把它当做某些专门机关的工作。这显然是完全不对的。我们现在已经看到有不少贪污分子已经完全蜕化为偷窃国家和人民财产的盗贼。他们所关心的仅仅是如何利用职位盗窃国家和人民的财产，已毫无革命工作人员的气味。他们所给予国家建设事业的损害，是难以计算的。但是，许多地方却还没有认真地展开一个群众性的反贪污斗争。目前已经揭发出来的贪污事件，毕竟还只是一部分，在全国各地必然还存在着相当数量的贪污事件未被揭发出来。这难道是可以高枕无忧的吗？
    现在，我们全国人民正在热烈响应毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的指示，开展增产节约运动，以支持中国人民志愿军。反对贪污浪费是增产节约运动的不可分割的一部分。全国各地都应该参照东北区的经验，大张旗鼓地开展反贪污斗争，努力根除这种严重损害国家和人民利益的罪恶现象。
    根据东北区的经验，要把反贪污斗争坚持下去，第一，必须开展一个群众性的民主运动。为此，应该吸收一切党和非党群众参加这一运动。应该反复向大家说明运动的意义，组织他们学习有关的文件，进行充分的酝酿，不断提高他们的觉悟。第二，必须由首长负责，亲自领导，并对于本单位所存在的主要缺点进行诚恳的深刻的自我批评，一次作不好，再作第二次，直到真正把群众发动起来。第三，必须着重思想领导。因为反贪污斗争是一个复杂而尖锐的斗争。有贪污行为的人，在运动开始的时候常常用各种方法来抗拒或逃避斗争。因此，领导人员必须给群众撑腰，加强思想领导，针对群众的各种顾虑，给以解释，以提高群众的积极性。贪污分子之所以不坦白，是怕丢脸，怕倒赃，怕撤职，怕法办；群众不敢大胆检举他们，是怕得罪人，怕运动只是一阵风就过去了，将来会受到报复和打击。经验证明，在运动开始时，群众往往不敢公开检举，而采取密告的办法；人民政府的负责人员对于这种密告必须认真处理，以鼓励群众大胆揭发贪污事件。第四，必须及时地处理已经弄清的问题。凡贪污而又自动坦白的，可以减轻对他的处分；小的贪污行为，经过坦白并查清情况之后，可以当众宣布这次免罪，以后再犯，加重处分。这样可以安定已经坦白了的人，推动有顾虑的人迅速坦白，并便于争取群众，孤立最坏的分子。第五，随着运动的深入和发展，群众的觉悟程度逐步提高，领导机关应及时提出新的指示，并总结经验，以推动运动的继续前进。第六，各单位应由一批强的干部组成检查小组作为领导的助手，深入检查，及时反映情况，并协助领导机关总结经验，指导运动。
    东北地区反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义斗争的经验证明，增产节约运动的最大敌人是贪污浪费和官僚主义。如果贪污浪费现象不能肃清，不但会断送一些干部的前途，而且会妨碍资金的积累，妨碍新民主主义制度的巩固。因此，全国各地都应该迅速行动起来，展开一个坚决反对贪污的斗争，来彻底消灭一切贪污现象。
