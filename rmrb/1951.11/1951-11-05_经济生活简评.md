    Anti-Waste Exhibition is a Good Method to Promote Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Movement
    The anti-waste exhibition held by the Nanjing Waterworks is a powerful propaganda form and organizational form for promoting asset inventory and capital verification work. The city's Telecommunications Bureau, Wired Electric Factory, Wireless Electric Factory, Water Engineering Instrument Factory and other units have universally used this propaganda method and organizational method, and have achieved good results.
    The anti-waste exhibition is an effective form of propaganda. It uses vivid facts to educate the broad masses of workers, making them realize the serious damage that waste inflicts on state property. The workers of Nanjing Waterworks felt very distressed after visiting the anti-waste exhibition. This corrected their complacency and further established their sense of being masters of the country; this prepared a solid mass ideological foundation for the anti-waste movement.
    The anti-waste exhibition is also an effective organizational form. In order to completely eliminate waste, it is necessary to find out the causes of waste and come up with thorough solutions. The anti-waste exhibition can play such a role. After visiting the anti-waste exhibition, the workers of Nanjing Waterworks immediately linked it with the waste phenomena in their own departments, studied ways to overcome them, and established and improved various systems, directly promoting the movement.
    Currently, enterprise departments across the country are carrying out asset inventory and capital verification work. If this kind of propaganda and organizational form, such as the anti-waste exhibition, can be universally promoted, it will surely have good results.

    反浪费展览会是推动清理资产
    核定资金运动的良好方法
    南京市自来水厂举办的反浪费展览会，是推动清理资产核定资金工作的有力的宣传形式与组织形式。该市电信局、有线电厂、无线电厂、水工仪器厂等单位，普遍运用这种宣传方式与组织方式，并获得良好的效果。
    反浪费展览会是一种有效的宣传形式。它用活生生的事实，教育广大职工，使他们认识浪费给予国家财产的严重损害。南京自来水厂的职工参观了反浪费展览会以后感到非常痛心，这就纠正了他们的自满情绪，使他们进一步树立了国家主人翁的观念；这就给反浪费运动准备了坚实的群众性的思想基础。
    反浪费展览会也是一种有效的组织形式。为了彻底消灭浪费，必须找出发生浪费的原因，想出彻底根绝的办法。反浪费展览会正可以起这样的作用。南京自来水厂职工参观了反浪费展览会后，立即联系本部门的浪费现象，研究克服的办法，建立与健全各种制度，直接推动了这一运动。
    现全国各地企业部门都在进行清理资产核定资金工作，像反浪费展览会这种宣传、组织形式，如能普遍推行，必将发生良好的效果。
