An introduction to the contents of Issue 115 of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy"

　　Issue 115 of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" was published on the 17th. The main contents include the editorial "The Indomitable Will of the People of All Countries to Strive for Peace," the current affairs commentary "The People of Asian Countries Oppose the San Francisco Treaty Which Prepares a New War," "The Communist Party of India Struggles for a Unified Democratic Front and a People's Democratic Government" by Ajoy Ghosh, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, and "The Consequences of Gasperi Undertaking Military Obligations" by Xie Jia, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party.

　　The editorial in this issue points out that the growth of the strength and scale of the world peace movement depends on the raising of the awareness of the broad masses of the people. The task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to enable everyone in all countries of the world to fully understand Stalin's great idea: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."

　　The article "The People of Asian Countries Oppose the San Francisco Treaty Which Prepares a New War" summarizes the opinions of people of various countries on this aspect, and explains that the United States' signing of a separate "peace treaty" with Japan has aroused universal anger in Asian and Oceanian countries. This proves that the American imperialists and their Japanese running dogs will never be able to realize their evil plans.

　　In the article "The Communist Party of India Struggles for a Unified Democratic Front and a People's Democratic Government," Ajoy Ghosh pointed out: The Party has stated that at the present stage, the Party's struggle goal is to strive for complete national independence and democracy, eliminate feudalism, return the land to the peasants, confiscate British capital and break with the British Empire, and establish a people's democratic government. Such a government, according to the situation in India, should be a government composed of representatives of workers, peasants, the middle class and the national bourgeoisie. The Party has announced that in order to achieve this goal, the Party will strive to establish the broadest unity of the people based on the solid unity of the working class and peasants in action. The Party has called on all parties, patriotic strata and groups to unite and undertake this great and glorious task.

　　Xie Jia pointed out in the article "The Consequences of Gasperi Undertaking Military Obligations" that the result of Gasperi's visit to the United States was to bring the "mission" of war to Italy, and the promise to revise the peace treaty and recognize Italy's demands on Trieste were impossible to obtain. The United States' insignificant "loans" and war orders will not only fail to reduce the number of unemployed people in Italy or ease the industrial crisis, but will further worsen the situation of the working people and the overall economic situation of the country.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”中文版第一一五期内容介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主”中文版第一一五期已在十七日出版。主要内容有社论“各国人民争取和平的不屈意志”，时事述评“亚洲各国人民反对准备新战争的旧金山条约”，印度共产党中央委员会书记处书记阿约艾·高士所作“印度共产党为统一的民主阵线、为人民民主政府而斗争”，以及意大利共产党副总书记谢嘉所作“加斯贝利承担军事义务的结果”等文章。
    本期的社论指出：世界和平运动的力量和规模的增长取决于广大人民群众的觉悟的提高。共产党与工人党的任务是使世界各国的每一个人都能彻底认识斯大林的伟大的思想：“如果各国人民把维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能保持和巩固。”
    “亚洲各国人民反对准备新战争的旧金山条约”一文综述了各国人民关于这一方面的舆论，说明美国签订单独对日“和约”，已经在亚洲和大洋洲各国引起了普遍的愤怒。这证明美帝国主义者及其日本的走狗将永远不能实现其罪恶计划。
    在“印度共产党为统一的民主阵线、为人民民主政府而斗争”一文中，阿约艾·高士指出：党已经表示：在现阶段，党的斗争目标是争取完全的民族独立和民主，消灭封建主义，使土地归与农民，没收英国资本并与英帝国决裂，成立人民民主政府。这种政府，根据印度的情况，应该是由工人、农民、中等阶级和民族资产阶级的代表组成的政府。党已经宣布：为要达到这种目的，党要努力建立以工人阶级和农民在行动上的坚固团结为基础的最广大的人民团结。党已经号召一切党派、爱国阶层和团体必须团结起来，担负这一个伟大而光荣的任务。
    谢嘉在“加斯贝利承担军事义务的结果”一文中指出，加斯贝利访美的结果，是给意大利带来战争的“使命”，修正和约的诺言和承认意大利对的里雅斯特的要求是不可能得到的。美国微不足道的“贷款”和战争订货不但不能减少意大利的失业人数，不能缓和工业危机，而且会使劳动人民的状况和这个国家整个经济情况进一步恶化。
