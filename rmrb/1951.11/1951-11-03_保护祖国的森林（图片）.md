    Protecting the Forests of the Motherland
    Liu Jiyou
    (XI) In the village, Wang Qingheng sometimes got up at night to check for flammable materials. He was very careful about places that could easily cause fires, such as the chimneys of houses.
    (XII) Once, he discovered that some farmers in the forest area were doing carpentry work for the gold mine bureau and were not paying much attention to fire safety. He helped them organize themselves to supervise each other in taking precautions against fire and assigned them areas of responsibility for fire prevention.
    (XIII) Every year, the masses often cause fires when burning paper money at graves. In response to this situation, Wang Qingheng proposed very specific methods: two people should go to the grave together, dig a pit to burn the paper money, with one person watching over the fire, and finally bury the ashes before returning home. This method has been implemented in his village.

    保护祖国的森林

    （十一）在村里，王清恒有时夜里也起来检查是否有引火物。对房子的烟囱等容易引起火灾的地方，他都非常留心。
    （十二）有一次他发现林区有些农民给金矿局做木工，对用火不大注意，就帮助他们组织起来，互相监督小心火烛，并划给他们负责防火的区域。
    （十三）群众每年上坟烧纸常易引起火灾。王清恒就针对这种情况，提出很具体的办法：上坟要两个人一块去，挖坑烧纸，一人看守，最后要把火灰埋上再回家。这方法在他村已实行起来。
