　　In the widespread production increase and conservation movement, the Northeast Region is now promoting a mass-based "waste paper recycling" method. It is estimated that after the implementation of this method, the annual savings will be equivalent to 70,000 tons of grain or twenty-eight fighter planes.

　　The "waste paper recycling" method was suggested by a reader of the Northeast Daily and received the approval of the newspaper's vast readership. After research by the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee, it was notified to relevant departments on November 1st to begin implementation. According to estimates by the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee, the Northeast Region can recover approximately 5,000 tons of waste paper annually, of which government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools account for approximately 60% of the total. This can produce approximately 4,000 tons of paper pulp, which can be used to manufacture 3,640 tons of office paper (i.e., 200,000 reams), saving the equivalent value of approximately 70,000 tons of grain or twenty-eight fighter planes.

　　"Waste paper recycling" is one of the good methods to solve the current shortage of paper pulp. Therefore, in addition to instructing the People's Economic Planning Committees of each province and city to seriously study and organize its implementation, the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee has also specifically stipulated waste paper grades, reference prices, as well as "waste paper pulp preparation" and acquisition methods.

　　In order to prevent the exposure of state secrets during waste paper recycling, the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee has specifically notified all government agencies, enterprises, organizations, and schools to designate specific personnel to be responsible for handling waste paper recycling work. According to experiments in some units, the secretariat and general affairs departments can jointly organize waste paper recycling teams. The secretariat department is responsible for waste paper collection, tearing the waste paper into pieces and putting it into a locked water tank. After the waste paper is soaked and dissolved into pulp, the general affairs department is responsible for selling the pulp to the acquisition department. In order to plan the allocation of waste paper pulp, the association stipulates that cooperative systems should manage acquisitions in a unified way. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 东北区实行“废纸回收”办法  一年节省价值等于七万吨粮食

　　东北区实行“废纸回收”办法
    一年节省价值等于七万吨粮食
    在广泛开展的增产节约运动中，东北区现正推行一个群众性的“废纸回收”办法，预计这一办法实行后，一年内约可节省价值等于七万吨的粮食或二十八架战斗机。
    “废纸回收”办法系由东北日报一读者所建议，得到该报广大读者的赞同，经东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会研究后，已于十一月一日通知有关部门着手实行。据东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会估计：东北区每年可收回废纸五千吨左右，其中各机关、团体、企业、学校约占总数的百分之六十，可产纸浆约四千吨，能抄造办公纸三千六百四十吨
    （即二十万令）；节省的价值约等于七万吨粮食或二十八架战斗机。
    “废纸回收”是解决目前纸浆不足的良好办法之一。因此，东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会除责成各省、市人民经济计划委员会认真研究和组织推行外，并具体规定了废纸等级，参考价格，以及“泡制废纸浆”和收购等办法。
    为了防止在废纸回收中暴露国家机密，东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会特通知各机关、企业、团体、学校指定专人负责处理废纸回收工作。根据有些单位的试验，可由秘书部门及总务部门共同组织废纸回收小组，秘书部门负责废纸收集工作，将废纸撕成碎片，放入盖上加锁的水箱，待废纸浸渍溶成浆状后，再由总务部门负责将纸浆卖给收购部门。为了有计划地分配废纸浆的使用，在收购方面，该会规定由合作社系统统一办理。（新华社）
