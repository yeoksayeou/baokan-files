    All-China Federation of Electrical Workers Issues Emergency Notice
    Launch Patriotic Production Increase and Economy Drive
    Calling on Electrical and Steam Industry Workers Nationwide to Participate in the Movement
   [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] The All-China Federation of Electrical Workers, in order to rapidly launch a patriotic production increase and economy drive in the national electrical and steam industry, issued an emergency notice on November 19th. The notice states: All workers of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau, Power Plant, and Xiahuayuan Power Plant, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "Increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," have launched a patriotic production increase and economy drive on the 7th and 18th of this month, and put forward the goals for this year. It is hoped that trade union organizations at all levels will pay attention to this matter and carry out the following work: 1. Immediately and proactively obtain the consent and support of the administrative side, and under the unified leadership of the Communist Party, vigorously mobilize and organize all employees to respond to Chairman Mao's call, launch a patriotic production increase and economy drive, propose a production increase and economy plan for this year, and prepare for next year. 2. The production increase and economy plans of each unit must fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses' in-depth discussions, careful calculations, and the proposal of rationalization suggestions, in order to arrive at correct and achievable figures. It is necessary to avoid doing everything by oneself and simply pursuing numerical deviations. 3. The production increase and economy movement of each unit must grasp the principle of "fully exploiting potential capacity on the basis of ensuring safety," and strive to improve equipment output and utilization rate, shorten maintenance time, utilize waste materials, adjust loads, eliminate waste, reduce costs, and do a good job in economic accounting, so as to achieve the goal of "increasing production and practicing strict economy." Finally, when carrying out this work, each unit must resolutely implement the tasks assigned by the local Party, government, and trade union, and proactively obtain their leadership and assistance, so that all electrical workers across the country can consciously participate in this great movement and strive to respond to Chairman Mao's call, increase production, and practice strict economy!
