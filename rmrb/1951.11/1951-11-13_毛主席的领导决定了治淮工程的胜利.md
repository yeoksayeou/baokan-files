Chairman Mao's Leadership Determined the Victory of the Huai River Project
　　Fu Zuoyi

　　The decision to fundamentally harness the Huai River and the successful completion of its first phase have become one of the most profoundly significant events in the lives of the people of the entire country in 1951.

　　Politically, this project has further strengthened the relationship between the People's Government and the broad masses; economically, it has enabled the Huai River basin to achieve a general bumper harvest in 1951 and laid a solid foundation for future perpetual harvests; ideologically, it has used concrete examples to depict a prominent image of the prospects for the development of our construction endeavors, making us more confident in our own strength and inspiring a stronger yearning for our future.

　　What power enabled us to achieve such a great victory? The most powerful factor that runs through all the work is the great leadership of Chairman Mao's thought.

　　Chairman Mao's Great Determination

　　The devastating floods in the Huai River basin occurred in mid-July 1950. The political situation at that time was that less than a year had passed since the basic liberation of the country, and the US imperialism had already begun the war of aggression against Korea. Everyone could see that the sword of US imperialism would not stop in Korea, but would carry out shameless interference in the newly born People's Republic of China. The domestic economic situation at that time was that financial and economic stability had just been achieved after fierce struggles, the newly liberated areas were preparing for land reform, and private industrial and commercial enterprises were still in a difficult and painful period of transformation. The state of water conservancy at that time was that after long-term destruction by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the widespread floods across the country in 1949, it was riddled with holes and everything was waiting to be rebuilt. In 1950, we only carried out some key projects, but the water conservancy expenditure already accounted for a considerable amount in the national budget. Under such circumstances, a devastating flood occurred in the Huai River. Considering the difficulties of various conditions, and the complexity and arduousness of the Huai River project, we only considered how to carry out emergency prevention and rescue in exchange for time for planning and preparation, and did not dare to consider fundamental governance.

　　But Chairman Mao did not think this way. Before the masses in the disaster-stricken areas of the Huai River basin had even made their demands, Chairman Mao, upon seeing the telegram from the East China Military and Political Committee reporting the disaster situation, immediately issued instructions to fundamentally harness the Huai River, and demanded that preparations be started immediately, large-scale construction to begin in the autumn, and significant results to be achieved within one year. Chairman Mao's decision was a tremendous shock to us at the time and a great comfort to the people of the Huai River basin. When this decision was conveyed, the 55 million people in the Huai River basin erupted in heartfelt cheers.

　　Why could Chairman Mao make such a wise and decisive decision so quickly under such circumstances? At that time, we only felt that this was the people's great leader's passionate concern for the masses. This burning love constrained us, preventing us from making any other considerations and forcing us to do everything possible to implement this decision. However, we still secretly held our breath. We thought, how difficult and huge is the project of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River! The floods of the Huai River were problems that the Kuomintang reactionaries, and even Yongle of the Ming Dynasty and Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, failed to solve despite repeated efforts during their heydays; how could we complete such an undertaking in the early days of nation-building, under the environment of imperialist aggression and blockade? However, after the start of the project, during the entire construction process, and amidst the subsequent changes in domestic conditions, especially after the launch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement, we gradually put aside our worries and gradually saw that Chairman Mao's decision was based on sound foundations. These foundations already existed at that time, but we could not see them. It was Chairman Mao who grasped and inspired these huge potentials, enabling them to unleash majestic power.

　　The main basis grasped by Chairman Mao was the demands of the people, the power of the masses. The people's revolutionary war, from nothing to something, from small to large, from underground struggle to achieving nationwide victory, mainly relied not on financial power, but on a correct political line that closely cared for the people's demands, organized the vast power of the people, and thus was able to overcome countless difficulties and achieve final victory. According to the same principle, since harnessing the Huai River was an urgent and pressing demand of 55 million people, this was the basic force to consider in placing the Huai River project in a primary position.

　　At the time when Chairman Mao decided to fundamentally harness the Huai River, the interference of US imperialism in our country had become a matter of national attention. Chairman Mao had of course given deep consideration to this issue. But he decided that even under the circumstances of US imperialism launching aggression, we should strive to complete the project of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River. This decision, on the one hand, demonstrated the leader of the people's profound concern for the people's lives, that even under war conditions, we should use the greatest possible force to relieve the people's suffering; on the other hand, the Huai River project was also an active encouraging force for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Only a country that never forgets the interests of the people is a country of the people themselves. Only for their own country can the people shed their blood, and advance wave upon wave to annihilate the invading enemy.

　　Facts have proved that Chairman Mao's decision was completely correct. Chairman Mao's decision became a life-saving gospel for the 13 million disaster-stricken people in the Huai River basin. The people who had fled returned, the people who had not fled settled down, and actively participated in the work of production for self-relief. Chairman Mao's decision was a huge driving force for the 55 million people in the Huai River basin. Whether in disaster areas or non-disaster areas, the majority of the masses enthusiastically and voluntarily signed up to participate in the Huai River project. Chairman Mao's decision was a fighting order for cadres at all levels and relevant departments. How many administrative and technical cadres, how much production and transportation power were immediately organized to use all their efforts to complete this task, to improve the quality and quantity of work. It was precisely because of this grasping of the masses' own demands, this development of the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, that such a great achievement could be created. Resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and fundamentally harnessing the Huai River were not contradictory, but combined. Every victory of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement became the most motivating slogan for production competition on the Huai River construction site. The huge achievements of the Huai River project were also a powerful basis for boosting morale and enhancing patriotic sentiment on the front lines of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.

　　From another perspective, the correctness of Chairman Mao's decision can be further proven. After the great flood of 1950, the Huai River basin had as many as 9 million people in severely affected areas awaiting relief. If no project had been undertaken at that time, various forms of relief would have been necessary. Calculating according to the minimum standard for maintaining life, it would have required more than 400 million catties of relief grain from August 1950 to April 1951. If another flood had occurred in 1951, the problem would have been even more difficult to solve. But according to Chairman Mao's decision, not only could the floods in the Huai River basin be fundamentally solved, but also, using work as a form of relief, it also incidentally solved most of the disaster relief work. At the Huai River construction site, I saw that none of the Huai River migrant workers had a sallow and emaciated appearance. They all had rosy faces, sturdy bodies, and happy moods. I then realized the greatness of Chairman Mao's policies. The people love labor. They are unwilling to rely on relief and eke out a living. They like to rely on labor to live that vibrant life. Being good at analyzing the overall situation, being good at synthesizing the demands of the masses, being good at guiding the direction of the mass movement, and fully developing the enthusiasm of the masses to do what the masses need is the unique leadership genius of a great people's helmsman. Chairman Mao has demonstrated such genius leadership countless times in the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. The Huai River project is only a brilliant example in construction work.

　　The Enlightenment of Chairman Mao's Thought

　　The Huai River project is not only a project decided by Chairman Mao, but also, in terms of the direction of governance, Chairman Mao's thought has given us great enlightenment, enabling the Huai River project to break through the old scope and become a new project with revolutionary significance.

　　Past Chinese society, because of its feudal and semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature, many projects were stamped with the imprint of feudalism and semi-colonialism. Many projects were not for the people, so they could not solve the people's problems. There are countless examples of this. For example, during the Qing Dynasty's governance of the Yongding River, the north bank was all stone embankments, while the south bank was earth embankments. This was because the north embankment protected the imperial capital, while the south embankment protected the ordinary people's fields. From the perspective of the emperor, their values were worlds apart. The five major rivers in Hebei converge in Tianjin and enter the sea through the Hai River. The total flow of the five major rivers exceeds that of the Hai River by several times, so it often threatens Tianjin and causes floods in Hebei Province. However, during the period of warlord rule, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the Japanese occupation of North China, the governance of the five major rivers consistently focused on the downstream, only paying attention to how to maintain the Hai River's transportation and how to protect the interests of imperialist countries in Tianjin, completely ignoring the flooding and breaches of these rivers in Hebei Province. This was because, from the perspective of imperialist countries and semi-colonial governments, the interests of imperialism were higher than the interests of the people. And the Hai River and Tianjin were the conduits and fortresses for imperialist economic and political aggression in China. (Today, we must carry out fundamental governance of these rivers from beginning to end, not only to protect Tianjin and improve the navigation conditions of the Hai River, but also to solve the needs of the vast number of farmers.) In the past, water conservancy projects caused such results for many reasons, but the nature of the society and the nature of the regime at the time played a decisive role. Because any water conservancy project plan has to change nature and, in connection with it, change the economic situation attached to natural conditions. Research plans in the study can have many subjective fantasies, but when implemented, they will conflict with the existing and future interests of certain people, thus creating contradictions and struggles. The outcome of the struggle is often that the powerful ruling class wins. Therefore, no matter how subjective the wishes of the water conservancy technicians at the time were, if we regard their subjective wishes and objective practice as a unified process, most of the past water conservancy projects served the reactionary ruling class. Due to the limitations of position, viewpoint, and method, most of the research and planning work in water conservancy in the past had ambiguous positions, unclear service goals, or served the reactionary ruling class. If we do not acknowledge this point, or do not raise our vigilance about this point and conduct renewed investigation and research, we will make mistakes.

　　In contrast to these situations, Chairman Mao often taught us to clearly establish the idea of serving the people. Chairman Mao often taught us to conduct class analysis of every matter so as not to help the enemy and harm ourselves. It is because of these beneficial lessons that we have raised our vigilance in the Huai River project, and have repeatedly researched and analyzed every old design and every piece of data to criticize the historical traditional erroneous prejudices, so that the Huai River project can truly become a project that serves the people.

　　At the time of the decision to undertake the Huai River project, Chairman Mao put forward the instruction of fundamental governance, requiring that we focus on long-term and far-reaching interests and fundamentally solve the problems of the Huai River; during the discussion of the Huai River planning, in response to the historical contradictions between the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River basin, Chairman Mao also put forward the instruction of joint protection by Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, with all three provinces working together. It is because of these important enlightenments that we have established the idea of overall planning for the entire basin, implemented the principles of small interests obeying large interests, partial obeying overall, eliminating harm while taking care of promoting benefits, and taking care of the future in the present.

　　In the Huai River project, the handling of floods is based on decades of rainfall and hydrological records, and the maximum possible flood is calculated as the basis for engineering design, so that after the completion of the entire project (not the first phase), it will certainly be able to fundamentally eliminate the disasters of floods. In the Huai River project, the handling of floods adopts the method of water storage as the main measure, so that not only can it eliminate the disasters of floods, but even in years of drought, it can largely solve the problem of irrigation water for farmland. In the Huai River project, many historically disputed issues have been resolved reasonably through joint investigation and joint research by the upper, middle, and lower reaches, comparing the advantages and disadvantages, so that the Huai River project has truly achieved the unity of opinions in the upper, middle, and lower reaches. In the Huai River project, most of the projects take into account the goals of all aspects, not only solving the flood disaster problem, but also having the benefits of irrigation, navigation, and power generation. The increase in benefits is the reduction in costs, so the Huai River project must not only achieve the goal of fundamental governance, but also be the most economical and reasonable project. Due to our insufficient ideological and technical level, the Huai River project still has shortcomings in individual issues, but the direction of work enlightened by Chairman Mao, I think, is the direction that water conservancy projects across the country should learn from.

　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we see infinite strength and endless hope

　　The main problems in the implementation of the first phase of the Huai River project were the large scale of the project and the short time frame. We had to make the most economical and reasonable arrangements for all work, and we had to raise work efficiency to the highest standard in order to complete such a huge engineering task in a short period of time.

　　The total amount of the first phase of the Huai River project was 200 million cubic meters of earthwork and 150,000 cubic meters of stonework and concrete work. Because the winter construction in 1950 only completed 15 percent of the total project, the remaining 85 percent had to be completed in the five months from February to June 1951. Among these projects, there were also many very difficult projects, such as the dredging of the Sui River, with 30 million cubic meters of earthwork, mostly consisting of sand-gravel and underwater soil extraction. For example, the Runheji diversion gate project, which had to complete an unprecedentedly large modern project in three months. For example, the Shimantan Reservoir project, the first leading project of the sixteen reservoirs on the Huai River. In the past, we lacked such a complete set of experiences, and we had to create experience and train cadres in this project. Therefore, to complete this huge task, on the one hand, we must learn to create advanced technology and production experience, on the other hand, we must organize the strength of the broad masses to make up for the lack of mechanical power, and on the other hand, we must combine production and disaster relief to solve various complex contradictions between engineering and disaster relief, and engineering and production. Due to the encouragement of Chairman Mao's determination, due to the concrete leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the broad masses of cadres taught by Chairman Mao, through the arduous struggles of the masses, not only did old-fashioned tools exert their highest efficiency, but also new experiences in manufacturing and using machinery were created, which not only completed this year's task, but also increased unlimited confidence for future work.

　　In April and May of this year, I went to the Huai River construction site for an inspection, walking from the source of the Ying River and the Hong River in the Funiu Mountains to the tail end of the Huai River entering the Yangtze River in Sanjiangying, and I also went to Shanghai to visit the metal workers who manufactured the materials and components for the Runheji diversion gate. Everything I saw was truly full of strength and full of hope. I saw hundreds of thousands of farmers concentrated together to work in an orderly and organized manner; I saw tens of thousands of shovels and hundreds of rollers operating together at the command of a single order; I saw hundreds of thousands of farmers holding group meetings, living a collective and democratic life, and having already learned to skillfully drive bulldozers, graders, dredgers, and other mechanized tools; I saw many migrant workers who came to the construction site empty-handed from their homes, and after the completion of the project, they had surplus food, learned culture, and went home with a happy mood; I saw 123 factories in Shanghai, with 12,000 workers, laboring day and night for more than forty days to manufacture gates and hydraulic presses, manufacturing products that could absolutely not be manufactured in the past; I saw the bare hands of the working people build winding embankments hundreds of kilometers long and huge majestic buildings, proudly laughing at the water flow of the Huai River; I saw hundreds of thousands of local cadres, following Chairman Mao's heart, doing the work of uniting, encouraging, and leading the masses everywhere; in extremely remote rural areas, I saw not a single idler, not a single lazy person, everywhere filled with the upsurge of increasing production, everywhere actively engaged in the movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and both the Huai River migrant workers and the masses at home had organized mutual aid in production. I traveled thousands of miles and did not even see a fight or quarrel. This scene gave me the greatest emotion, making me deeply appreciate the significance of the revolution led by Chairman Mao. In history, no government has ever penetrated a government order, a movement, or a water management work so deeply and universally to the extent that it is known to every household. This is an unprecedented organizational force. Relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government is deeply rooted in every corner, every piece of land, and every person's heart. Therefore, the power of the People's Government is unshakable and great. With Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we can not only cure the Huai River, but we can do everything that should be done.

　　毛主席的领导决定了治淮工程的胜利
  　傅作义
    根治淮河的决定及其第一期工程的胜利完成，已经成为一九五一年全国人民生活当中具有深刻意义的事件之一。
    在政治上，通过这一个工程，更加密切了人民政府和广大群众之间的关系；在经济上，它使淮河流域的土地，在一九五一年得到普遍的丰收，并为将来永远的丰收奠定了坚固的基础；在人民的思想上，它用具体的实例，给我们建设事业可能发展的前途，刻划出一个突出的面影，使我们对自己的力量，更加自信，对自己的前途，生出更为强烈的向往的热情。
    是什么力量使我们能够获得这样巨大的胜利，贯穿在一切工作当中的最有力量的因素，就是毛主席思想的伟大的领导。
    毛主席的伟大决心
    淮河流域发生巨大的水灾，是在一九五○年七月中旬。当时的政治情况，是全国基本解放还不到一年的时间，美帝国主义却已经开始侵略朝鲜的战争，人人可以看出，美帝国主义刀锋不会停止在朝鲜，而是要对新生的中华人民共和国，进行无耻的干涉。当时国内经济的情况，是经过剧烈的斗争，刚刚获得金融财政的稳定，新解放区正在准备进行土地改革，私营工商业，还正处在艰难痛苦的转变期中。当时水利事业的情况，是经过国民党反动统治长期破坏，和一九四九年全国普遍的水灾之后，千疮百孔，百废待兴，一九五○年我们只是有重点地做了一部分工程，可是水利经费在国家总预算里已经占了相当巨大的数字。在这样的情形之下，淮河发生了巨大的水灾。估计到各种条件的困难，估计到治淮工程的复杂艰巨，我们只考虑到怎样进行紧急的防救，以换取计划准备的时间，没有敢考虑根本的治理。
    可是毛主席却不是这样考虑。在淮河流域受灾群众还没有提出自己的要求以前，毛主席在看到华东军政委员会报告灾情的电报的时候，就立即提出根治淮河的指示，并且要求即刻着手研究准备，秋季开始大规模的施工，要求在一年以内，就要做出显著的成效。毛主席的决定，当时对我们是一个巨大的震动，对淮河流域的人民是一个巨大的安慰。这决定传达下来，淮河流域五千五百万群众，迸发出一片知心的欢呼。
    为什么毛主席在那样的情况之下，可以这样迅速地做出这样英明坚决的决定呢？当时我们只觉得这是伟大的人民领袖对群众的热烈的关怀。这种炽热的爱逼住了我们，使我们不能再作别的考虑，只能想尽一切方法来贯彻这个决定。可是我们心里总还在暗暗地捏着一把汗。我们想，根治淮河是多么艰难巨大的工程！淮河的水灾是国民党反动派，以至明朝的永乐，清朝的康熙，在他们极盛时代几番经营，所没有解决的问题；我们在建国初期，在帝国主义侵略封锁的环境之下，怎样能完成这样的事业？可是在工程开始以后，在全部施工的过程当中，在此后国内各种条件的变化当中，特别是在抗美援朝的运动展开以后，我们就逐渐放下了自己的心事，逐渐看出毛主席的决定是有根据的。当时这些根据就已经存在，而我们却看不见它，是毛主席掌握了启发了这些巨大的潜力，使它发出了雄伟的力量。
    毛主席所掌握的主要根据，是人民的要求，是群众的力量。人民革命战争从无到有，从小到大，从地下的斗争，到取得全国规模的胜利，主要的不是依靠财政力量，而是依靠一条正确的政治路线，紧紧地照顾了人民的要求，组织起广大人民的力量，于是就能克服无数困难，取得最后胜利。根据同样的道理，治淮既是五千五百万人民紧急迫切的要求，这就是考虑治淮工程应当放在首要地位的基本力量。
    在毛主席决定根治淮河的时候，美帝国主义对我们的干涉，已成为全国注视的问题，对这问题，毛主席当然已做过深刻的考虑。但是他决定就是在美帝国主义发动侵略的情况下，我们也要争取完成根治淮河的工程。这一个决定，一面是说明了人民的领袖对人民的生活是抱着何等关切的态度，就是在战争情况底下，也要用最大可能的力量，来解除人民的痛苦；另一面，治淮工程对抗美援朝也是一个积极的鼓舞的力量。唯有念念不忘人民利益的国家，才是人民自己的国家，人民为自己的国家，才能够抛头颅，洒热血，前仆后继，以歼灭进犯的敌人。
    事实证明，毛主席的决心是完全正确的。毛主席的决心，对淮河流域一千三百万受灾人民成为一个救命的福音。已经逃亡的人民回来了，未逃走的人民安定下来，积极地参加了生产自救的工作。毛主席的决心，对淮河流域五千五百万人民是一个巨大的动力。无论灾区与非灾区，多数群众都踊跃地自愿地报名参加治淮工程。毛主席的决心，对各级干部，有关部门，是一个战斗的号令，有多少行政、技术干部，有多少生产运输力量，立即组织起来，为完成这个任务，用尽心思，以提高工作的质量数量。正因为这样地掌握了群众的切身的要求，这样地发挥了广大干部和群众的积极性，才能造出这样巨大的成就。抗美援朝和根治淮河，不是相矛盾的，而是相结合的，抗美援朝运动的每一个胜利，在淮河工地都成为最有鼓动力量的生产竞赛的口号，治淮工程的巨大成就，对抗美援朝前线，也是鼓舞士气，提高爱国主义情绪的一个有力的根据。
    从另一个角度来看，更可证明毛主席决心的正确。一九五○年大水之后，淮河流域重灾待救的群众就有九百万人之多，假如当时不举办工程，也必须进行各种的救济，按最低限度维持生命的标准计算，从一九五○年八月到一九五一年四月，也需要救济粮食四亿斤以上。假如一九五一年再发生水灾，问题将更不好解决。可是依照毛主席的决定，不但是淮河流域的水灾可以得到根本的解决，同时，以工代赈，也附带地解决了救灾工作的大部分问题。我在淮河工地，所看见治淮的民工，没有一个带着面黄肌瘦的样子，都是红红的面孔，结实的身体，愉快的心情，于是更体会到毛主席政策的伟大。人民是爱劳动的，他们不愿意依靠救济，苟延残喘，他们喜欢依靠劳动过那活生生的生活。善于分析全盘的情况，善于综合群众的要求，善于引导群众运动的方向，充分发挥群众的积极性，来做好群众所需要的事情，这是一个伟大的人民的舵师所独具领导的天才，毛主席在第一次国内革命战争当中，在第二次国内革命战争当中，在抗日战争当中，在解放战争当中，无数次发挥了这样天才的领导，治淮工程，仅只是在建设工作上的一个光辉的范例。
    毛主席思想的启示
    治淮工程不但是毛主席决定的工程，同时在治理的方向上，毛主席的思想，也给我们极大的启示，使治淮工程突破了旧的范畴，成为一个具有革命意义的新的工程。
    过去的中国社会，因为是封建的和半殖民地半封建性质，所以许多工程都打着封建和半封建的半殖民地的烙印。许多工程不是为了人民，所以也不能解决人民的问题。这样的例子多不胜举，比如清朝一代对永定河的治理，北岸都是石堤，南岸则是土堤，这因为北堤保护的是帝王的都城，南堤保护的是普通人的田产，从帝王的立场来看，其价值是天地悬殊的。河北五大河会合在天津由海河入海，五大河总的流量超过海河数倍，所以经常威胁天津，并在河北省泛滥为灾。可是在军阀统治，国民党反动统治及日寇侵占华北的时期，对五大河流的治理，一贯地是从下游着眼，只注意怎样维护海河的交通，怎样保护帝国主义国家在天津的利益，完全忽略这些河流在河北省境的泛滥溃决，这因为从帝国主义国家和半殖民地政府来看，帝国主义的利益高于人民的利益。而海河和天津是帝国主义在中国进行经济和政治侵略的孔道和堡垒。（今天我们是要从头到尾对这些河流进行根本的治理，不但要保护天津，改进海河航运情况，同时要解决广大农民的需要。）过去的水利工程，所以造成这样的结果，原因虽然很多，当时的社会性质、政权性质，是起着决定的作用的。因为任何一个水利工程计划都是要改变自然，并连带改变附着于自然情况的经济情况，在书斋中的研究计划尽可以有许多主观的空想，到实行起来，就会和若干人现有的和未来的利益发生冲突，因而造成矛盾和斗争，斗争的结局常常是有势力的统治阶级获得胜利。所以不管当时的水利技术人员主观的愿望如何，若把他们主观的愿望和客观的实践当做一个统一的过程来看，过去的水利工程大多数是为反动统治阶级服务的。由于立场观点方法的限制，过去许多水利方面的研究和计划工作，多数是立场模糊，服务的目标不明确，或者是为反动统治阶级服务的。假如不承认这一点，或者对这一点不提高警惕，做重新的调查研究，我们就要犯错误。
    和这些情形相反，毛主席经常教导我们，要明确建立为人民服务的思想，毛主席经常教导我们，对每件事情要进行阶级的分析，才不致帮助了敌人，危害了自己。是由于这些有益的教训，使我们在治淮工程中提高了警惕，对于旧有的每一项设计，每一种资料，都做了反复的研究分析，以批判历史的传统的错误的成见，使治淮工程，真正成为人民服务的工程。
    在治淮工程决定的时候，毛主席就提出根治的指示，要求从长期的远大的利益着眼，根本地解决淮河的问题；在讨论治淮规划的时候，针对着淮河流域上中下游历史的矛盾，毛主席又提出河南皖北苏北，三省共保，三省一齐动手的指示。是由于这一些重要的启示，使我们确立了全流域统筹规划的思想，贯彻着小利服从大利，局部服从整体，除害照顾兴利，现在照顾未来的原则。
    在治淮工程里面，对于洪水的处理，是根据几十年雨量水文的纪录，推算出可能发生的最大洪水，做为工程设计的根据，所以全部工程（不是第一期工程）完成以后，一定可以根本免除洪水的灾害。在治淮工程里面，对于洪水的处理，是采取以蓄水为主的方法，所以不但可以解除洪水的灾害，即使遇见干旱年份，也可大部解决农田灌溉用水的问题。在治淮工程里面，有许多历史上纷争不决的问题，都经过上中下游共同调查与共同研究，比较利害大小，求得合理的解决，所以治淮工程是真正做到了上中下游意见的一致。在治淮工程里面，多数工程是兼顾着各方面的目标，既解决了水灾问题，同时还有灌溉、航运、发电的效益，效益的增加就是成本的减低，所以治淮工程既要达到根治的目的，同时又是最经济最合理的工程。由于我们的思想技术水平还不够高，治淮工程在个别问题上还是有缺点的，但是毛主席所启示的这种工作的方向，我想是全国水利工程应当学习的方向。
    在毛主席的领导下，我们看见无限的力量和无穷的希望
    第一期治淮工程实施方面的问题，主要是工程大、时间短，必须把一切工作做到最经济最合理的安排，必须把工作效率提高到最高的标准，才有可能在短期内完成这样巨大的工程任务。
    第一期治淮工程的总量，共有两亿立方公尺的土工，十五万立方公尺的石工和混凝土工，因为一九五零年冬季施工只完成全部工程的百分之十五，其余百分之八十五，都要在一九五一年二至六月，五个月的时间内全部完成。在这些工程当中，又有很多非常困难的工程，比如濉河疏浚的工程，三千万立方公尺的土工，大部是砂礓石和水中取土的工作。比如润河集分水闸工程，要在三个月的时间内，完成一座空前巨大的现代化工程。比如石漫滩水库工程，是淮河上十六个水库的第一个带头的工程，我们在过去还缺乏这样的整套的经验，是要在这个工程里，创造经验，训练干部。因此，要完成这个巨大的任务，我们一方面必须学习创造高级的技术和生产经验，一方面必须组织广大群众的力量，以补救机械力量不足，另一面还必须结合生产救灾，解决工程和救灾，工程和生产各项复杂的矛盾。由于毛主席决心的鼓舞，由于毛主席所教导的中国共产党和广大干部的具体领导，通过群众的艰苦斗争，不但使旧式工具发挥了最高效率，同时创造了制造机械使用机械的新的经验，不但是完成了今年的任务，同时给将来的工作，增加了无限信心。
    在今年四五月间，我曾到淮河工地视察一次，从伏牛山上颍河与洪河的源头，走到三江营淮河入江的尾闾，并曾到上海慰问为润河集分水闸制造材料机件的五金工人。我所看见的一切，真是满眼都是力量，满眼都是希望。我看见几十万农民集中在一起工作，秩序井然，有条不紊；我看见几万张锨，几百架硪，在一个号令下，一齐操作；我看见几十万农民分组开会，过着集体的民主的生活，并且已经学会熟练地驾驶推土机、平土机、挖泥机等机械化的工具；我看见许多民工，赤手空拳从家里来到工地，到工程完成以后，剩余了食粮，学习了文化，满载着愉快的心情，散工回家；我看见上海一百二十三家工厂，一万二千职工，为制造闸门，制造油压力机，四十几天日日夜夜的劳动，制造了过去所绝对不能制造的产品；我看见凭劳动人民的双手，平地修起蜿蜒的千百公里长堤和巨大雄伟的建筑，在对着淮河的水流，傲然欢笑；我看见几十万地方干部，依照毛主席的心，到处做着团结、鼓舞、领导群众的工作；在极为偏僻的农村里，我看见没有一个闲人，没有一个懒人，到处洋溢着增产的热潮，到处活跃着抗美援朝的运动，治淮民工和在家群众都组织了生产互助。我走了几千里的道路，甚至连打架吵嘴的事情都没有见过。这景象给我最大的感动，使我深刻体会到毛主席所领导的革命的意义。历史上没有一个政府，曾经把一个政令、一个运动、一个治水的工作，深入普遍到这样家喻户晓的程度，这是一个空前的组织力量。依靠共产党的领导，人民政府是深深的扎根在每一个角落、每一块土地、每一个人心的深处，因此人民政府的力量是不可摇撼的伟大。有了毛主席和共产党，我们不仅能够治好淮河，我们能够做好一切应该做好的事情。
