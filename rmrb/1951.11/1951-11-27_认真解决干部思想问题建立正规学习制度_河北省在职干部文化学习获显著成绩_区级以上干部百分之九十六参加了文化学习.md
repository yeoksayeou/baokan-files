Hebei Province has seen over ninety-six percent of its on-the-job cadres at the district level and above participate in cultural learning. Since the province began to extensively establish spare-time cultural schools last September, there are now 157 cultural schools in organs above the county level, with a total of 1,094 classes and 609 full-time teachers. After cultural instructors were assigned to districts below the county level, on-the-job cadres were also generally organized to participate in cultural learning. After more than a year of study, the cultural level of cadres has improved significantly. Most cadres have developed the habit of learning culture and have established the determination to improve their cultural level. The achievements in on-the-job cadre cultural learning in Hebei Province are mainly due to the leadership organs' serious resolution of the ideological problems of cadres in learning culture and the establishment of a regular system suitable for on-the-job cadre learning.

The vast majority of on-the-job cadres in Hebei Province are of worker-peasant origin, and their cultural level is generally low. They urgently need to improve their culture to overcome difficulties in their work. However, when cultural learning was first organized, some cadres emphasized that they were busy with work and did not think they had time for this kind of regular cultural learning; some cadres had narrow empiricist ideas, believing that they had become cadres without culture in the past and did not value cultural learning; some regarded learning theory as a political privilege. Seeing that new intellectual cadres were learning theory, they themselves were learning culture instead, thinking that the treatment was unfair and unwilling to participate in cultural learning. When grading according to each person's cultural level, some cadres aimed too high and were unwilling to be placed in lower grades; some cadres wanted to save effort and were unwilling to be placed in higher grades. After the start of learning, some cadres were eager for quick success and became discouraged when they encountered a little difficulty in learning; some cadres did not review after class and did not do homework, so that the results of learning could not be consolidated. In response to these situations, the leadership organs at all levels explained to the cadres that only by diligently learning culture could they adapt to the needs of national construction in the future, and it was not enough to rely solely on old experience to do work; and explained that organizing cadres to learn culture was precisely the concern and cultivation of cadres by the higher authorities. After the start of learning, the leadership organs at all levels also pointed out that grading should be done according to each person's actual cultural level, and everyone should study seriously so that everyone can get the due results in learning. After repeated enlightenment, discussion, inspection, and criticism, these confused thoughts were gradually clarified.

In learning, leading cadres with lower cultural levels took the lead by example, participating in and adhering to learning. Their exemplary actions had a great impact on other cadres. For example, He Bingzhang, Secretary of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other members of the Prefectural Committee attended classes on time every day, listened attentively, persisted in learning when going to the countryside, and personally asked middle school teachers to help them learn. Li Yuenong, Deputy Commissioner of Cang County Commissioner's Office, carried cultural textbooks with him when going to the countryside, seizing the time to learn culture at any time. Therefore, although he often went to the countryside, he could still keep up with the progress of the course. Many cadres said, "The Party Secretary, the Commissioner, and the County Head are all busy learning culture, are we busier than them?" As a result, those who were unwilling to learn culture before have also changed.

In the second half of 1949, the leading organs of Hebei Province proposed that cadres with a cultural level below junior high school should learn culture. However, at that time, the organization and leadership in cadre cultural learning were unsound, and there was no one in charge of teaching; at the same time, many cadres only measured their cultural level by the level of Chinese language, thinking that their cultural level was not low, and did not seriously learn culture; therefore, the learning gains were not great. Later, many cadres encountered many difficulties in work and theoretical learning due to the lack of knowledge of mathematics, history, geography, etc., and gradually felt the need to carry out regular learning. In June last year, Hebei Province uniformly stipulated the standards for cadre learning grading and equipped full-time teachers. After the opening of spare-time cultural schools, many classes were able to carry out teaching according to the unified school system and curriculum, and established systems for attendance, homework, leave, graduation, and transfer. The spare-time cultural schools of some organs are directly managed by the cultural and educational departments of the People's Government, and they absorb representatives of various organs to organize school affairs committees to jointly solve various problems in teaching. The leading organs at all levels in the province mostly pay attention to giving on-the-job cadres time to study. The Communist Party branch of the organs also takes ensuring adherence to learning as one of the regular tasks of the Party. In February this year, various places generally inspected and rectified the spare-time cultural schools of the organs. Since then, the spare-time cultural schools in various places have further embarked on the right track. In addition, various counties have strengthened the leadership of district cultural instructors, so that district cultural instructors can better organize district cadres to learn. Some counties hold district cultural instructor meetings every month to report and deploy work and exchange teaching experience. Therefore, the cultural learning of district cadres in these counties has gradually been consolidated.

Many of the cadres in organs above the county level often have to go to the countryside to work, and they cannot often stay in the organs to learn. These cadres have encountered the problem of not being able to keep up with the progress of the course in learning. In order to solve this problem, the teachers of some spare-time cultural schools have made it a practice to pre-teach the outline and key points of the course according to the length of time the cadres are going to the countryside before the cadres go to the countryside, and issue study outlines so that the cadres can persist in self-study when they go to the countryside. If the cadres who go to the countryside encounter difficulties in self-study, they can ask the local teachers for help, or they can ask the teachers to make up lessons after returning to the organs. Now, some actively learning cadres have been able to complete cultural learning assignments and keep up with the progress of school courses when they go to the countryside. In general districts, in order to adapt to the characteristics of district cadres often working in a dispersed manner, many places closely integrate the learning system with the work system, and conduct collective learning when district cadres return from the countryside to report, summarize, and deploy work. Some areas have also established a system of learning days and learning stations. District cultural instructors go to the learning stations on learning days to teach in rotation and check students' course assignments. In addition to attending classes at the learning stations, district cadres can usually ask local teachers to help them with self-study. After Hebei Province adopted these measures, district cadres in some areas have been able to persist in participating in regular cultural learning. (Xinhua News Agency)

    认真解决干部思想问题建立正规学习制度
    河北省在职干部文化学习获显著成绩
    区级以上干部百分之九十六参加了文化学习
    河北省区级以上的在职干部已有百分之九十六以上参加了文化学习。该省自去年九月开始大量开办业余文化学校后，目前全省已有县以上机关的文化学校一百五十七处，共有一千零九十四个学习班，并有专职教员六百零九人；县以下各区自配备了文化教员后，也普遍地组织了在职干部进行文化学习。经过一年多的学习，干部文化水平已有显著提高，大部分干部已养成学习文化的习惯，并树立了提高文化的决心。河北省在职干部文化学习能得到这样的成绩，主要是由于领导机关认真的解决了干部学习文化中的思想问题和建立了适合于在职干部学习的正规制度。
    河北省的在职干部绝大部分是工农出身，文化水平一般都较低，他们迫切需要提高文化来克服工作中的困难。但在开始组织文化学习时，有些干部强调工作忙，认为没有时间进行这种正规的文化学习；有的干部存在着狭隘的经验主义，认为过去没有文化也一样当了干部，不重视文化学习；有的把学理论当作政治待遇，看到知识分子新干部学理论，自己反学文化，认为待遇不公平，不愿意参加文化学习。在根据各人文化水平编级时，有的干部好高鹜远，不愿编入较低的年级；有些干部想省劲，不愿编入较高的年级。在开始学习后，有些干部急于求成，在学习中遇到一点困难就灰心泄气；有的干部上过课以后不复习，不做作业，以致学习成果不能巩固。该省各级领导机关曾针对这些情况，向干部说明只有努力学习文化才能适应今后国家建设的需要，只凭老经验来做工作是不够的；并说明组织干部学文化，正是上级对干部的关心和培养。学习开始后，各级领导机关又指出应当按各人实际文化水平编级，并要求大家认真学习，使每个人在学习上都能得到应有的成果。经过反复的启发、讨论，并进行了检查和批评后，这些混乱思想才逐步澄清。
    在学习中，文化水平较低的领导干部以身作则，参加并坚持了学习。他们的模范行动对其他干部有很大影响。如中共唐山地委书记贺秉章和地委会其他委员每天按时听课，专心听讲，下乡时也坚持学习，并亲自找中学教员帮助他们学习。沧县专署副专员李悦农下乡时带着文化课本，随时抓紧时间学文化，因此他虽常下乡，但仍能经常跟上课程的进度。许多干部说：“党委书记、专员、县长都忙着学文化，咱再忙还有他们忙吗？”于是原来不愿学文化的也都有了转变。
    在一九四九年下半年河北省领导机关曾提出初中以下文化水平的干部应学文化，但当时在干部文化学习方面，组织领导不健全，且无专人负责教导；同时很多干部也只以国文程度来衡量自己的文化水平，以为自己文化程度不低，不认真学文化；因此学习的收获不大。后来，许多干部在工作和理论学习中由于缺乏数学、历史、地理等知识，遇到很多困难，才逐渐感到进行正规学习的必要。在去年六月，河北省统一规定了干部学习编级的标准，配备了专职教员。在业余文化学校开学后，许多学习班都能按统一学制及课程进行教学，并建立了考勤、作业、请假、毕业、转学等制度。有些机关的业余文化学校由人民政府文教部门直接主管，并吸收了各机关代表组织校务委员会，共同解决教学工作中的各种问题。该省各级领导机关大都注意使在职干部有学习的时间。中共机关支部也把保证坚持学习作为党的经常工作之一。今年二月，各地又普遍地检查和整顿了机关业余文化学校。从此，各地业余文化学校便进一步走上了正规。另外各县又加强了对区文化教员的领导，使区文化教员更好地组织区干部进行学习。有些县里按月召开区文化教员会议，汇报和布置工作，交流教学经验。因此，这些县里的区干部文化学习就逐渐巩固下来。
    县以上的机关干部中有许多是常要下乡工作的，他们不能经常留在机关学习。这些干部在学习中就发生了跟不上课程进度的问题。为解决这个问题，有些业余文化学校的教员已作到在干部下乡前，按下乡时间的长短预先教授课程的概要和重点，并发给学习提纲，使干部在下乡时可以坚持自学。下乡干部在自学中遇到困难时就可找当地的教员帮助，也可以在回机关后请教员补课。现在部分学习积极的干部已能在下乡时，同样完成文化学习的作业，跟上学校课程进度。在一般区里，为适应区干部经常分散工作的特点，很多地方把学习制度和工作制度密切结合起来，在区干部从乡回到区汇报、总结、布置工作的时候进行集体学习。有部分地区还建立了学习日和学习站的制度，区文化教员每逢学习日就到学习站轮回教学并检查学员的课程作业。区干部除到学习站听课外，平时可以找当地教员帮助自学。河北省采取这些措施后，部分地区的区干部已能坚持参加正规的文化学习。　（新华社）
