Xinhua News Agency, 16th: "Ce Soir" reporter Pierre Béguin reported from Kaesong on the 16th: Unless the truth inside the conference tent is written on balloons floating above it, or written in smoke in the sky for reporters to photograph, it is difficult to imagine how the outside world can know the truth about what is happening inside. In the past few days, the Korean and Chinese representatives have repeatedly explained their views on determining the demarcation line, the second item on the agenda, and the "de facto" ceasefire. I and other reporters on the Korean and Chinese side have reported on this, Beijing Radio has broadcast it, the People's Daily editorial in Beijing has commented on it, and it can also be found in the full text of the speeches. But the U.S. propaganda machine continues to do its own thing. General Li Sang-cho said to the U.S. side yesterday: "The ceasefire on the ground, at sea and in the air will only take effect when the armistice agreement comes into effect." But the U.S. side told reporters outside the conference tent: "The Communist side demands an immediate ceasefire on the ground, at sea and in the air when the demarcation line is determined." Yesterday, I gave the U.S. reporters an excerpt of General Li's speech from the day before, which clearly denied the repeated fabrications by Nuckols that the Korean and Chinese side demanded an immediate ceasefire. The American reporters admitted that if this excerpt was correct, it meant that Nuckols had been deceiving them all along. Later, they took this excerpt to the conference tent and asked the U.S. representatives, who said that the excerpt was "largely correct." But despite this, they continue to distort the facts and repeat their previous lies. One wonders if any event in modern history has been subjected to such deliberate and prolonged distortion by American reporters. There is a Far East branch chief of a U.S. news agency in the conference area, who is a personal friend of Ridgway. He leaves Nuckols only to find out what other reporters are talking about, in order to report to Nuckols. Here, a small number of reporters, under this person's leadership, are deceiving public opinion, undermining the negotiations, and prolonging the war.

　　巴黎“今晚报”记者报道
    揭穿美方欺骗宣传
    【新华社十六日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌十六日自开城报道：除非把会议帐篷里面的真实情况写在飘浮于会议帐篷上空的气球上，或者用烟幕写在天空中，让记者拍照，否则就很难想像会议帐篷里面的真实情况怎样为外界所知。在过去几天中，朝中代表曾反复说明他们关于确定分界线、第二项议程以及“事实上的”停火的意见。这种意见，我以及朝中方面的其他记者都报道过，北京电台广播过、北京人民日报社论都评论过，也见于发言全文。但是美方宣传机器依然自行其是。李相朝将军昨天对美方说：“只有到停战协议生效时才在地面、海上和空中停火。”但是美方在会议帐篷外面又告记者说：“共方要求在确定分界线时立即在地面、海上和空中停火。”昨天，我把李将军前天的发言摘录拿给美方记者看，这篇发言摘录明白否认纳科斯一再捏造的朝中方面要求立即停火的说法。美国记者承认，如果这篇发言摘录是正确的，那就表示纳科斯一直在欺骗他们。后来他们把这篇摘录带到会议帐篷里去问美方代表，美方代表说，这篇摘录“大体上是正确的”。但是尽管这样，他们依然歪曲事实，重复以前的谎言。人们怀疑，近代历史上是否有过任何事件受到美方记者这样蓄意的长时的歪曲。会议区内有美国的某通讯社的远东分社社长，这个人是李奇微的私人朋友，他离开纳科斯只是为了探听其他记者谈论的消息，以便向纳科斯报告。这里有少数记者在这个人的领导下欺骗舆论，破坏谈判，让战争拖延下去。
