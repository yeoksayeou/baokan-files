    I Demand That the People's Government Punish My Cruel and Incorrigible Mother According to the Law
  　Dictated by Li Liqing, Written by Zhu Bo
    My name is Li Liqing, and I am a nineteen-year-old girl. Because I disagreed with my mother's arranged marriage for me, I have been subjected to beatings and torment by my mother for several months. If it weren't for the People's Government and the Women's Federation saving me, I might have lost my life. Now I want to accuse my mother of her crimes and request the People's Government to punish her according to the law.
    I am from Baoding, Hebei Province. My mother, Li Zhangshi, is a leader of the I-Kuan Tao sect. More than ten years ago, she and my father moved to the Second Street outside Deshengmen in Beijing. When I was seven years old, I returned to my hometown of Baoding because my father passed away. I had not corresponded with my mother for more than ten years. Last November, my mother forced me to come to Beijing, and I didn't know why. After arriving in Beijing, I learned that she wanted to make money off me. She and my younger brother and sister ganged up to bully me and often beat and scolded me. They said that I had no ability and couldn't earn money. But in reality, after I came to Beijing, I worked hard to earn money for them, and I gave them all my wages. I didn't spend any money on myself. Even so, I didn't get a kind look from them.
    In July of this year, when I came back from work, my mother and the matchmaker Wu Wangshi (people on the street call her "old whore") were discussing marrying me off to a family surnamed Dong. It was agreed that the bride price would be five bolts of cloth, two gold rings, a watch, and more than five yards of silk and patterned twill fabric. When my mother mentioned this marriage to me, I said, "I don't want to. I'm still young. Let's talk about it in two years." When my mother heard that I didn't want to, she got angry and pointed at me, saying, "Good! You won't listen to me. You want to be free, don't you! Let me tell you, I'm not dead yet!" As she spoke, she picked up a bamboo plank more than two feet long and hit me on the head with it. She also said, "I'll teach you to disobey me! I'll teach you to be free!" I planned to run out, but as soon as I reached the door, she grabbed my hair and pulled me back, closed the door, and continued to beat me. When the bamboo plank broke, she used her hands to hit my face. My head swelled up with bumps an inch high, and my whole face was swollen. She beat me for two whole hours. Later, someone broke down the door and pulled her away. At four o'clock the next afternoon, she had just come home from outside when she angrily asked me, "The Dong family has a house and land, and they don't lack food or clothing. Why don't you want to marry him?" I said, "Mom, I'm still young. If you need money, I'll work and earn money to support you." She stomped her foot and said, "No! If you don't go, you're not my daughter!" At that time, I thought I couldn't explain it to her for a while, so I didn't say anything. But she didn't give up. She bolted the door and found a broom to beat me with. When the broom broke, she used her hands to hit me. I kept crying and begging her, "Dear Mom! Please spare me! I won't make you angry anymore." But begging didn't work. She said, "I'll beat you so that you'll remember it for the rest of your life." When she got tired of hitting me with her hands, she picked up a washboard and beat me with it. I lost all sensation in my body, and my head and hands were bleeding. My face turned bluish-purple, but she still didn't stop beating me. She kept beating me until eight o'clock at night when she was too tired to continue. After that, she didn't let me eat. She and my younger brother and sister took turns eating, leaving one person to watch me and not allow me to move a step.
    Not even two days had passed when she started scolding me again, saying that I didn't listen to her. As she scolded me, she started hitting me again, and even my younger sister helped her by stabbing me with an awl. At this time, Wu Wangshi came and pretended to be a good person to persuade me. She said, "You don't know your mother's temper. If you don't obey her, she'll never let you go. I think you should just agree." She forced me to agree. I had no choice but to agree. They also forced me to meet the Dong family.
    When I met the Dong family, my mother and the matchmaker Wu Wangshi were watching me. I didn't dare to tell the Dong family that I didn't want to. I said, "We can get engaged, but I'm still young. I want to wait two years before getting married." I also proposed that "after the engagement, I still want to go out and find work." The Dong family didn't want to, saying, "That won't do. My family has few people..." Later, the Dong family didn't want me anymore. According to the matchmaker Wu Wangshi, the Dong family didn't like my "attitude" when we met, saying that I "didn't want to get married right away and still wanted to go out and find work." When my mother heard this news, she knew that there was no hope for what she wanted, so she viciously beat and scolded me again.
    After this matter passed, I thought I could finally have a few days of peace. Who knew that after a short time, Xu Daoshang's wife came to my mother again, wanting to find me another husband. She said, "This family is surnamed Gao, has forty rooms, and ten buildings. They live in the city and have everything they need. Marrying into that family will guarantee you happiness..." I was very impatient and said, "I don't care about money, and I'm not worried about food. I have two hands, so I'm not afraid of not having food to eat! I don't want to get married..." Before I could finish speaking, my mother pulled me off the bed, squeezed me into a corner, and slapped my face, saying as she hit me, "Even mules and horses can be beaten into submission, let alone you!" She beat me until I had no choice but to agree. I really had no choice, so I thought about writing a letter to the police station, asking them to save me. I didn't dare to write in the house, so I found a piece of paper and ran to the toilet to write. I happened to run into the neighbor's little girl, and I asked her to send the letter to the police station for me. I told her not to let my family know. Just as I said this, my mother heard it, and she said, "Sending a letter? Bring the letter here, and I'll send it for you." She grabbed my hair and pulled me out, told my younger brother and sister to close the door, and said viciously, "You haven't given up yet!" Mom picked up a broom and started hitting me. The broom broke, and then she found a wooden stick to hit me with. She was so tired that she couldn't even hold the wooden stick, so she used her hands to hit me. No one could persuade her to stop. Whoever tried to persuade her too much, she would scold. She beat me from morning until five o'clock in the afternoon, and finally beat me unconscious. When I woke up, I had already been tied up by her. She said she was going to throw me into the kiln pit and drown me (there were brick-burning kiln pits near where we lived, full of water). Seeing her viciousness, she really was going to throw me into the kiln pit. I quickly knelt down to her and cried, begging her, "Dear Mom! Please spare me this time. I'll listen to you from now on!" Even after begging her like this, she still kicked me twice. She said she wanted me to write a statement, or she wouldn't spare me. I asked my younger brother to write it for me, with my mother dictating: First, I cannot go out to work. Second, I will leave as soon as there is a suitor. When I get to my husband's family, I must work hard and never get a divorce, even if it kills me. Third, I am not allowed to approach the government, and I am not allowed to talk about family matters to outsiders. Fourth, if I violate any of the above conditions, I voluntarily jump into the kiln pit and die. After it was written, she also wanted me to find a guarantor. I asked my younger brother to be my guarantor and also put my fingerprint on it. Finally, she also wanted me to read it once. When I read the second article, my eyes were filled with sparks, and I couldn't see a single word. I begged her, "Mom! I'll listen to everything you say, please spare me, I really can't see." She still kicked me hard and said, "Are you blind! You can't see!" She had my younger brother read it again.
    The next day, she and Xu Daonan's wife made an agreement with the Gao family, and the Gao family gave 1 million yuan. But later, the Gao family didn't want me anymore. They said that the "zodiac signs didn't match": I am nineteen years old, born in the year of the rooster, and he is thirty years old, born in the year of the dog. "A rooster and a dog never come to a good end," so the marriage didn't work out.
    Neither of the two marriages worked out, but I was put under surveillance. My mother still said to me every day, "Have you forgotten those four conditions?" Three people took turns monitoring me, never leaving me for a moment.
    Once, my mother had to go out and asked Auntie Tian to watch me. Auntie Tian said to me, "If you really want to run, no one can stop you! Who can just sit and wait to die!" After hearing this, I asked Auntie Tian to allow me to go to the district. Auntie Tian nodded and said, "Okay, go ahead, I'll watch your mother for you."
    In the Fourteenth District Women's Federation, I told the comrades of the Women's Federation in detail about the suffering I had endured. When they heard it, their eyes turned red. They said, "Don't worry, we will definitely help you solve the problem." That afternoon, the Women's Federation comrades brought my mother in and criticized her for not laying such a cruel hand on her own daughter and for not arranging her daughter's marriage. After talking for a long time, my mother not only didn't listen but also said arrogantly:
    "My own daughter is my business, and no one can interfere! It's right for me to arrange her marriage and beat her. Is it against the law for a mother to beat her daughter!" The Women's Federation comrades couldn't persuade her, so they suggested that if she didn't change, I wouldn't go home with her. Later, they sent her to the street People's Government and asked her to write a statement before letting me go home, but she firmly refused to write it. I said, "If she doesn't write it, I won't go back. Comrades, if you save me, save me to the end." When my mother heard this, she gnashed her teeth and grabbed a paper cutter to stab me. Fortunately, someone pulled her away. The comrades of the street government said, "We can't let Liqing go home. Will things be okay if she goes back like this?" Later, they asked me to stay temporarily at the home of Auntie Liu, the director of the Women's Federation on Second Street. They also promised to find me a job.
    Now, the comrades of the Women's Federation have introduced me to work at the nursery of the Marx-Lenin Academy. I am very grateful to the People's Government and the comrades of the Women's Federation because they saved me from the fiery pit.
    Everyone, think about it, my mother treated her own daughter so barbarously and cruelly for the sake of earning a sum of money. Is this something that the new society can allow? Am I my mother's private property? Am I a cow or a horse? Why did she harm me so cruelly? I declare that from now on, I no longer recognize her as my mother. I want to break off my mother-daughter relationship with her. I also request the People's Government to punish her according to the law so that other mothers can be educated and dare not harm their daughters for their own benefit.

    Editor's note: Li Liqing has now formally filed a complaint with the Fourteenth District People's Court of Beijing, demanding that her mother be punished according to the law. The court has detained Li Zhangshi. We believe that such a serious criminal act by Li Zhangshi, who did not hesitate to harm her daughter with the most cruel means for the sake of money, must be severely punished by law. During the trial and sentencing of this case, we should organize as many people as possible to attend the hearing, especially mothers who have similar thoughts and behaviors as Li Zhangshi, to promote how mothers should treat their children's marriages and to promote the benefits of free marriage in the New Democracy; to tell them that arranged, forced, and mercenary marriages are illegal and will be punished by law; and to call on them to act in accordance with the Marriage Law and quickly correct their wrong thoughts and practices. The result of doing so will surely gradually reduce similar incidents.

    我要求人民政府依法惩办我的残忍成性的母亲
  　李立卿口述  朱波代笔
    我叫李立卿，是一个十九岁的女孩子。因为我不同意母亲包办我的婚事，数月来一直遭受母亲的毒打和折磨。如果没有人民政府和妇联会救我，恐怕连性命都没有了。我现在要控告我母亲的罪恶，要求人民政府依法惩办她。
    我是河北省保定人，母亲李张氏，是一贯道的坛主，和我父亲在十多年以前就迁来北京市德胜门外第二街住。我七岁上，因为父亲病故，就回到保定老家去。十多年没有和母亲通过信。去年十一月，母亲逼着我来北京，我也不知道为什么。来北京以后，才知道她是要拿我赚一笔钱。她和弟弟、妹妹联合起来欺侮我，时常打骂我。她们说我没有本事，不能挣钱。可是，实际上我来北京以后，曾经辛辛苦苦地做工挣钱给她们，而且都是把全部工资交给她们。自己没有花过零钱。虽然这样，也没有换得她们一个好脸。
    今年七月里，我做工回来，我母亲就和媒婆吴王氏（街上的人都叫她“破鞋”）商量着把我嫁给一家姓董的。说好身价是五匹布，两个金戒指，一只手表，五丈多绸子和花斜纹布等东西。当母亲给我提这个亲事的时候，我说：“我不愿意，我还年青，过二年再说吧。”我母亲一听我说不愿意就恼了，气愤愤地指着我说：“好！你不听我的话，你是想自由去不是！告诉你，我还没有死哩！”说着就拿起一块二尺多长的竹板子，照着我的头就打。还说：“我叫你不听话！我叫你自由去！”我打算跑出去，刚走到门口，就被她抓住头发拉回来，关上门继续打。竹板打断了，就用手打我的脸。头上起了一寸高的一块一块的疙瘩，满脸都肿起来了。整整打了两个钟头。后来，别人撞开门才拉开。第二天下午四时，她刚从外边回家来，又气汹汹地问我：“人家姓董的有宅子有地，不缺吃不缺穿，你为什么不跟人家？”我说：“妈，我年纪还小，你要是缺钱花，我做工挣钱来养活你老人家。”她把脚一跺说：“不行！不去就不是我的女儿！”我当时想一时也和她说不清楚，就不说话了。但是她却不依，闩上门，找了一个扫帚打我。扫帚坏了，又用手打。我一个劲的哭着哀求她：“亲妈！你饶了我吧！我不叫你生气了。”哀求也不行。她说：“非打得叫你记一辈子不行。”她用手打累了，就又拿起一个洗衣服的搓板打。打得我混身都失去知觉了，头上、手上都流了血，脸变成了青紫色，她还是不停地打我。一直打到夜里八点钟，她实在太累了，这才歇手。这以后，她也不叫我吃饭了。她和弟弟、妹妹轮流吃饭，留一个人看着我，一步也不准我走动。
    还没有过两天，她又骂起来了，说我不听她的话。她一边骂着就又打我，连妹妹也帮着她拿锥子扎我。这时吴王氏来了，假装好人劝我。她说：“你妈的脾气你不是不知道，你要是不依着她，她和你没有个完，我看你还是答应了吧。”她逼着我要我答应。我没有办法，只好答应了。她们又逼着我和姓董的见面。
    我和姓董的见面时，我妈和媒婆吴王氏在一边监视着我。我不敢对姓董的说不愿意，我说：“订婚可以，我现在年纪还小，要等二年再结婚。”并提出“订婚以后我还要出去找工作。”姓董的不愿意，说：“那不行，俺家人少……。”后来，姓董的不愿意要我了。据媒婆吴王氏说，姓董的嫌我见面时“态度不好”，说我“不愿意马上结婚，还要出去找工作”。我母亲听到这个消息，知道她想要的东西没有希望了，就又恶毒地打骂我。
    这件事情过去以后，我心想可该安生几天了。谁知过了不久，徐道尚的老婆又找我妈来了，要给我另说一个婆家。她说：“这家姓高，有四十间房，还有十间楼，住在城里，真是要什么有什么，嫁过去保管享福……”我听得很不耐烦，说：“我不图钱，也不是为的吃饭，我有两只手，还怕没有饭吃！我不愿意结婚……。”我没有说完，我妈就把我从床上拉下来，挤在墙角里用手打我的脸，随打随说：“骡子、马都能打过来，别说是你！”打得我不得不答应下来。我实在没有办法了，就想到要给派出所写个信，要他们救救我。我不敢在房子里写，就找了一张纸，跑到厕所里写。刚巧碰上邻家的小丫，我请她替我把信送给派出所。我告诉她，千万不要被我家里的人知道。刚说到这里，我妈听见了，她说：“送信吗？拿信来我替你送去。”抓住我的头发就拉出来了，叫弟弟妹妹关上门，恶狠狠地说：“你还没有死心哪！”妈拿起一个扫帚就打，扫帚坏了；又找到一根木棍子打。她累得连木棍子也拿不住了，就又用手打。别人劝也劝不开，谁劝得紧了她就骂谁。从早晨打到下午五时，最后把我打得昏了过去。等我醒过来的时候，我已被她捆起来。她说要把我丢到窑坑里淹死（我们住的附近有烧砖的窑坑，满坑是水）。我看她那个狠劲，真是要把我丢到窑坑去。我赶快给她跪下，哭着哀求她：“亲妈！你饶我这一次，我以后一定听你老人家的话！”就这样哀求她，她还狠狠地踢了我两脚。她说要我立字据，不然就不饶我。我求弟弟替我写，由妈说着：第一，不能出去参加工作。第二，一有婆家就走。到婆家要埋头苦干，受死也不离婚。第三，不准接近政府，家里的事不准向外说。第四，违反以上条件时，自愿跳窑坑死。写完后，还要我找保人。我请求弟弟当我的保人，还按了手印。最后，她还要我念一遍。我念到第二条时，眼里直冒火星，一个字也看不见了。就哀求她说：“妈！我什么都听你的，饶了我吧，我实在看不见了。”她还狠狠地踢了我一脚，说：“你的眼瞎啦！你看不见！”她又叫弟弟念了一遍。
    第二天，她和徐道南的老婆就跟姓高的说好了，姓高的给出一百万元。可是后来姓高的又不愿意了。人家说是“属相不对”：我十九岁，属鸡，他三十岁，属狗，“鸡狗不到头”，这门亲事算没有成。
    两次亲事都没有成，可是我却被监视起来了。我妈每天还说我：“你忘了那四个条件了没有？”三个人轮流监视我，一步也不离。
    有一次我妈要出门，托田大妈看着我。田大妈说我：“要真想跑，谁也看不住你！谁能活活地受死呀！”我听了以后，就要求田大妈允许我到区里去。田大妈点了点头说：“好，你去吧，我替你看着你妈。”
    在十四区妇联会里，我详细地把受过的痛苦告诉给妇联会的同志。她们听了，眼圈都红了。她们说：“放心吧，一定帮助你解决问题。”当天下午，妇联同志就把我妈找来，批评她不应该对自己亲生的女儿下这样的毒手，不应该包办女儿的亲事。讲了半天，我妈不但不听，而且态度很蛮横地说：
    “我自己的女儿，谁也管不着！我替她订婚、打她都是应该的。母亲打女儿还犯法！”妇联同志说服不了她，就提出：如果她不改变就不叫我跟她回家。后来把她送到街人民政府，要她写个字据才叫我回家，她坚决不写。我说：“她不写我就不回去，同志们救我就救到底吧。”我妈一听，就咬牙切齿地抢起一把割纸刀来要扎我。幸亏叫别人拉开了。街政府的同志们说：“不能叫立卿回家，这样回去还有好吗？”后来要我暂住在二街妇联会主任刘大妈家。并答应替我找工作。
    现在，妇联会的同志把我介绍到马列学院托儿所工作了。我非常感激人民政府和妇联会的同志，因为她们把我救出了火坑。
    大家想一想，我母亲为了挣一笔钱，竟这样野蛮残忍地对待亲生的女儿，这是现在的新社会所能允许的吗？我难道是母亲的私有财产吗？我是牛马吗？为什么她这样惨害我？我声明，从今以后，我再不承认她是我的妈妈。我要和她脱离母女关系。我并且要求人民政府依法惩办她，好叫别的母亲都受个教育，不敢再为自己赚钱而伤害女儿。
    编者按：李立卿现已正式向北京市第十四区人民法院提出控告，要求依法惩办她的母亲。该法院已将李张氏扣押起来。我们认为，对于李张氏这种为了金钱，不惜用最残忍的手段伤害女儿的严重犯罪行为，必须予以严厉的法律制裁。在审讯与判决这一案件时，并应尽量组织群众旁听，尤其应组织具有与李张氏类似思想、行为的母亲们旁听，向她们宣传母亲应该怎样对待子女的婚事，宣传新民主主义的自由婚姻的好处；告诉她们包办、强制婚姻和买卖婚姻是违法行为，一定要受到法律制裁；号召她们依照婚姻法办事，赶快改正错误的思想与做法。这样做的结果，一定会使类似事件逐渐减少。
