Summary of Work of the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
(Approved by the Last Plenary Session of the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition Working Committee on November 20, 1951)

The North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition successfully concluded on November 20. The general situation, gains, experiences, and post-exhibition work to be done in various places are reported as follows:

The Organizing Committee of the Conference was established in Tianjin on July 15, consisting of 47 people appointed by the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, including relevant departments from the five provinces and two cities of North China and Inner Mongolia, model workers from industry and agriculture, representatives from industry and commerce, and representatives from minority nationalities. The five provinces of North China, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia subsequently established organizing sub-committees. The preparation time was 80 days, employing 2,500 staff members; the exhibition time was 45 days, employing 5,000 staff members. The exhibition featured 13,000 kinds of exhibits, mainly from North China and Inner Mongolia, and also concentrated on major industrial, handicraft, agricultural, sideline, and special local products from the five major administrative regions of East China, Northeast China, Central South China, Northwest China, and Southwest China. The number of visitors reached 1 million. The conference warmly received nearly 40,000 people from all walks of life, including nearly 20,000 farmer representatives, commissioners and county heads from the entire North China region, overseas Chinese, and foreign guests. Except for Xinjiang and Tibet, which did not send trade delegations, a total of 103 trade delegations with more than 2,300 people from major administrative regions, provinces, and important cities across the country participated in the conference's transactions, with a total transaction value of over 15,600 billion yuan. Under the organization and leadership of the conference's Propaganda Committee, the significance and content of the conference were widely disseminated through newspapers, radio broadcasts, publications, photography, lectures, and other publicity activities. In terms of safety and sanitation, the high vigilance and hard work of the staff prevented any accidents from occurring and provided appropriate treatment for sick representatives. Under the principle of "taking from the conference, using for the conference, taking reasonably, and using sparingly," the conference's finances were balanced with a slight surplus.

The conference played a significant role, with the following main gains:

I. Specific and vivid patriotic education was conducted for audiences from all walks of life. This conference comprehensively displayed the vast and resource-rich appearance of the motherland, conducted a large-scale review of the brilliant achievements of industrial and agricultural production in North China – industrial production capacity has greatly exceeded that of the Kuomintang period, and the production of major industrial products such as coal, electricity, pig iron, steel ingots, steel, and yarn has exceeded the highest production levels in history. Agricultural production has reached pre-war levels and vividly reflects the bankruptcy of American imperialist "blockade." All this allowed visitors to further appreciate the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, the superiority of the new democratic system, and the correctness of the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, thereby further enhancing their determination and confidence in defending and building the motherland and consolidating the new democratic system. For example, after visiting the exhibition, many employees automatically revised their patriotic production increase and conservation plans. Many farmer representatives expressed their willingness to actively launch a patriotic bumper harvest movement, produce more grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods, and were particularly willing to sell their existing cotton to the state. Overseas Chinese showed great excitement and pleasure after seeing the vastness of the motherland and the rapid progress in all aspects since liberation. Friends from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries felt the greatness of the power of the People's China after seeing the exhibition; some guests from capitalist countries had to change their previous mistaken view that China was backward after visiting the exhibition.

II. Farmers clarified the reason why the working class is the leading class, strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, and close relations between urban and rural people. Before visiting Tianjin, farmer representatives generally believed that "if farmers didn't farm the land, no one would have food to eat, and the world was conquered by farmers, so farmers should occupy the leading position." "Workers are in the city, farmers are in the countryside, you do yours, and we do ours, there is no way to unite the workers and peasants." Although many rural cadres executed the instructions of their superiors and often educated farmers that the working class was the leading class, they were never convinced in their hearts. After visiting the exhibition, factories, and holding worker-peasant get-togethers and forums, they learned that workers had suffered the deepest oppression from the reactionary ruling class in the past, so their combativeness was also the strongest; they also saw that the working class was connected with large-scale production, had high labor productivity, strong organization, and great creativity. They realized that workers had a promising future and were indeed more advanced than farmers, while the small-scale peasant economy was too backward. Therefore, they wholeheartedly admitted that the working class was the leading class. They said: "Our past production was like turning a millstone, no matter how many years we turned, we couldn't move forward. Now workers produce machines, new agricultural tools, and chemical fertilizers to help farmers improve production, it's really a different look every year. In the future, we will also use machines to farm the land, and life will be better than it is now." They also saw the beautiful life of Soviet collective farms from the pictures and saw from reality that the lives of urban people were "upstairs and downstairs, with electric lights and telephones, and the floor was cleaner than their own kang (a traditional Chinese brick bed-stove)." Therefore, they felt that they had "divided the land, lived in tiled houses, and had wives, children, livestock, new agricultural tools, and surplus grain." It wasn't "the best it could be," but still "far from it." This powerfully criticized their complacent and conservative views and greatly stimulated their thinking of further organizing, vigorously developing production, and gradually moving towards socialism. In addition, the estrangement between urban and rural people was further broken. In the past, although many urban residents knew that farmers had made great achievements in the revolutionary war, it was always abstract; some people still thought that farmers were "ignorant and backward." Before coming to Tianjin, although farmers also knew that today's cities were the cities of the people, it was also very abstract, and there were always concerns about being "bumpkins"; some even "held their wallets tightly" and "kept their small packages close to them" when they got off the train. However, after this warm welcome and reception, and after mutual complaints and heart-to-heart talks in forums, visits, get-togethers, and other occasions, both sides realized that the past urban-rural opposition was the result of long-term and cruel exploitation of the countryside by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, with cities as their base. Now that the people's revolution has achieved victory, a relationship of urban-rural mutual assistance led by cities has been established, and we should no longer hold on to the old views. Therefore, farmers felt: "The urban people are progressing really fast. In the new China led by Chairman Mao, urban and rural people have become one family." Urban residents also deeply felt that farmers were progressive, hardworking, brave, and simple, so they were honored to receive farmers. The feelings between each other were very harmonious, and many people were reluctant to part when they left.

III. Pointed out the direction of industrial and agricultural production development and the importance of improving technology. In industry, the conference exhibited more than 70 technical improvements and creations by the working class. Such as Tianjin's self-made four-cylinder internal combustion engine, trolleybus, high-speed diesel engine, 500-door automatic telephone exchange, Shanxi's self-made tractor, 65-horsepower coal cutter, etc.; and introduced many advanced experiences of labor models, such as Tianjin Steel Plant Pan Changyou's successful experience in hot repairing Martin furnaces, Datong Coal Mine Ma Liuhai team's national record of digging 479 meters in September (actual working days 27 days), Tianjin Hengda Tobacco Factory Zhang Shuyun's successful experience in learning Guo Valiaofu's working method, Tianjin Clothing Factory Li Zhaozhen team's sub-industry cooperation operation method, etc. Through these specific deeds, it pointed out that to manage factories well, we must rely on the working class, give full play to the high enthusiasm and creativity of the employees, and establish a scientific management system and implement the economic accounting system (such as safety responsibility, production responsibility, shift handover, collective contract, contact contract, statistical inspection, workshop cost accounting, quota management, etc.) on the basis of democratic reform and democratic management. The conference also displayed thousands of handicrafts, purposefully guiding the development of handicraft production to supplement the deficiencies of machine-made industrial products and promote the development of machine industry. At present, the difficulties in handicraft production are mainly the dispersion of production, small number of people, small capital, low technology, poor quality, high cost, and inability to sell. In addition, the wage, working hours system, and the relationship between master and apprentice are also unreasonable, affecting production. Therefore, organizing, improving management, overcoming backwardness and decentralization, and gradually turning into semi-machine or machine industry is the correct path for the current development of handicrafts. In agriculture, it clearly pointed out that "organizing" is the correct path for agricultural production to move forward. Some farmers thought before visiting the exhibition: "In the past, organizing was to solve the difficulty of labor and animal power. Now that the difficulty has been solved, why do we still engage in mutual aid groups? Mutual aid is not as convenient as working alone." But after seeing at the conference that all bumper harvest labor models were taking the road of organizing, they realized that organizing was indeed stronger than working alone, which can reasonably divide labor, save manpower, improve technology, facilitate the purchase of new agricultural tools, and do things that cannot be done by one household, and can quickly increase production and embark on the road to a well-fed and well-clothed life. The agricultural sector more prominently exhibited many new bumper harvest records and new experiences, such as Shanxi Li Shunda's mountain land producing 980 catties of jade corn per mu, Qu Yaoli's producing 920 catties of cotton per mu, Hebei Zhang Xishun's dry land producing 1,300 catties of millet per mu, Pingyuan Wang Xihe's producing 900 catties of wheat per mu, Pingyuan Yang Jianshan's producing 800 catties of spring millet per mu on paddy fields, Hebei Ma Guorong's producing 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes per mu, Suiyuan Dang Xingxian's producing 8,000 catties of potatoes per mu, etc., and exhibited the achievements and experiences of Inner Mongolia pastoral model Lin Sangma and Ha Yin Jin in increasing livestock and protecting livestock. At the same time, the conference systematically introduced policies on promoting improved varieties, overcoming disasters, closing mountains for afforestation, developing animal husbandry, and the specific achievements of implementing policies. The above-mentioned new bumper harvest records of agricultural labor models and the improvements and creations of industrial labor models are precisely the clear banners for us to further improve industrial and agricultural production, greatly inspiring and inspiring the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and peasants in production. The common characteristics of these labor models are the combination of production and patriotism, the combination of hard work and improving technology, and the combination of individual efforts and mutual cooperation. Many workers said after visiting the exhibition: "If we want to increase production and conserve for the country, we must study while doing and try to improve tools, machines, and working methods." Farmers also realized: "If we want to produce more grain and cotton per mu, we must use our brains and be attentive. Simply 'suffering to death' is not enough." At the same time, the achievements of these worker-peasant labor models also pointed out the correct direction of progress for experts, professors, and intellectuals—scientific theory and technology must be combined with mass production practice, and intellectuals must be combined with the working people to achieve something. We hope that all experts, professors, and intellectuals will make greater achievements in combining with mass production practice and the working people.

IV. In an organized manner, it promoted the nationwide exchange of urban and rural materials, solved the different trade requirements of various regions, promoted the planned development of industrial and agricultural production, and consolidated urban-rural mutual assistance and the worker-peasant alliance economically. In the transaction of more than 15,000 billion yuan, North China and Inner Mongolia accounted for 66.14% of the procurement and 84.3% of the sales; other major administrative regions accounted for 33.86% of the procurement and 15.7% of the sales. In the total transaction value, spot goods and contracts accounted for 68.32%, and agreements accounted for 31.68%. Both contracts and agreements were carefully established after mutual consultation and discussion. Sales were mainly of local and special products, accounting for more than 60%, and found sales channels for some slow-selling products, with a total of more than 700 billion yuan of slow-selling products sold. Because the conference implemented the trading policy of taking into account both public and private interests and mutual benefit, the materials were reasonably distributed, and the transaction had great political significance. In the transaction, the conference first supported the procurement requirements of the Northeast region, which is the forward area of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; it gave appropriate consideration to areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as Southwest China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia, as well as old revolutionary base areas in Northwest China and North China, and disaster areas in North China. The disaster areas in North China were able to buy everything they wanted and sell everything they wanted. According to statistics, the total value of local and special products sold in Chahar reached 90.9 million catties of millet; in addition to the pre-sale of 10 million catties of white hemp, it was still worth 40.89 million catties of millet. The total value of local and special products sold in Suiyuan was 76.63 million catties of millet. The main handicrafts such as local cloth, straw braid, and pockets sold by disaster victims in Pingyuan could earn a profit worth 20 million catties of millet. This powerfully supported the disaster victims' production self-rescue. In addition, the existing trade routes in various places have been further consolidated. Many new trade routes have been established, such as the direct exchange of medicinal materials between North China and Central South China, the sale of rosin and tung oil from Central South China to North China, and the sale of ephedra from Chahar and Inner Mongolia to East China. The exchange of materials within North China is also closer than before. For example, livestock from Suiyuan are sold to Hebei, ginger slices and water tobacco from Pingyuan are sold to Suiyuan, and a large number of prepared medicines are sent to the countryside, which is unprecedented. Through this organized large-scale transaction, the planning of production and sales has been greatly enhanced, and the blindness has been reduced. The sales channels, prices, and specifications of many products are clearly stipulated in the contract, and production can be carried out with peace of mind according to the plan. For example, the entire production of sulfur in Shanxi next year has been contracted; Chahar's white hemp has been contracted for 10 million catties, which will be delivered in the autumn of next year. The supply and sales situation of local and special products among major administrative regions has also been roughly clarified. The output, production period, quality, specifications, price, and sales channels of various local products in North China have been basically understood. If there were no such conference, it would be impossible to obtain these materials in just a few months. These materials greatly facilitate us in further guiding and improving agricultural and sideline production and the production and sales of local and special products in a planned way and avoiding blindness.

V. Through this transaction and exhibition, the commodities of urban industry and commerce have been subject to a mass appraisal, thus clarifying the direction of improvement for industry and commerce. That is, urban industrialists and merchants should further face the countryside according to the opinions of farmers, study the increasing needs of farmers, and actively produce the means of production and livelihood urgently needed by the countryside, such as new agricultural tools, pesticides, agricultural machinery, fertilizer powder, bean cake, cloth, and other daily industrial products. In order to facilitate local production and sales, some industries and handicrafts that completely supply the needs of the countryside can also be moved to small and medium-sized towns or the countryside. Industrialists and merchants must further improve their business methods, overcome the bad habits of shoddy manufacturing and speculation, and strive for good product quality, low prices, suitability, durability, and timely supply.

The above situation and gains show that the conference has fully achieved its expected goals. The achievement of this achievement is due to the correct leadership of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, the strong support given by the five provinces of North China, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia in terms of in-depth publicity, collection of exhibits, organization of visits, and organization of trade delegations, especially Tianjin City in all aspects, the assistance of relevant departments of the central government and friendly regions, the unity and hard work of all staff, and the absorption of experience from material exchange exhibitions in various places.

However, the conference also has many shortcomings, mainly: 1. Because a unified editorial and review institution was not established in time, the exhibition materials were somewhat chaotic, some exhibits were repetitive, and there were too many exhibition halls, making it difficult for the audience to visit. In the exhibited materials, the leading role of state-owned trade was not shown enough, and the huge role of cooperative economy in the new democratic economy was also not shown enough. Some agricultural products did not indicate the soil (such as paddy fields, dry land), climate, and price of the place of origin. For grain varieties with different yields, they were not criticized and promoted separately according to different regions, soils, and climatic conditions. Some agricultural tools also did not indicate the price, which hindered promotion. 2. In the first few days of the transaction, there was a general atmosphere of "lack of daily industrial products," which aroused a mentality of being bullish and reluctant to sell, which once affected the conference's transactions. At the same time, because the exchange did not set up an institution to control prices and a few merchants speculated and made trouble, the price of commodities in the exchange was higher than the price of commodities outside the exchange, which also fueled the bullish mentality. At that time, the policy of "buying and selling, buying more and selling more" and the method of "hot goods for hot goods, hot goods leading cold goods" were put forward, which was correct, but some people mechanically believed that they must exchange hot goods for hot goods. Although these problems were quickly resolved, they hindered the rapid increase in the number of transactions. 3. Due to the short time, urgent tasks, and lack of experience, some expenses were slightly inadequate. 4. In terms of reception work, in the first week after the opening of the conference, the preparations for meals and transportation were insufficient, causing inconvenience to farmer representatives and trade delegations in various places.

The conference has the following main experiences:

I. Holding exhibitions is one of the most effective ways to educate the masses, educate cadres, and promote work. The advantage of this method is that it uses concrete and vivid things, models, and charts to explain policies, combine theory with practice, which is easy for the audience to understand, and thus can solve problems that are not easy to solve by relying solely on theoretical political education. This kind of exhibition that combines theory and practice can not only be used to exhibit urban-rural material exchange, but also can be used to exhibit culture, health, and other aspects, of course, the scale can be large or small, and the content can be diverse.

II. Clarifying the principles and policies is the primary condition for the success of this conference. We first clarified that the main task of the conference was to sell agricultural, sideline, local, and special products, especially slow-selling products, and that the venue was the market, and to vigorously solicit business. This was done because selling these things could increase farmers' purchasing power, improve farmers' lives, and thus open up a vast market for urban industrial products and expand the source of industrial raw materials. At the same time, it clarified the implementation of production direction education and worker-peasant alliance and patriotic education. In the preparation process, we put forward the working principle of "saving, fast, and beautiful." In the arrangement, we implemented different specific policies according to the different conditions of each pavilion. For example, the Industrial and Commercial Improvement Pavilion emphasized how the new production relations of "taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, urban-rural mutual assistance, and internal and external exchange" replaced the production relations under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; emphasized the importance of democratization and scientificization of production management and relying on the working class; emphasized the exhibition of the working class's technical creations and improvements; and emphasized the improvement of private enterprises in management style and management methods under the leadership of the People's Government. In the Agricultural Production Materials Pavilion, it pointed out the importance of agricultural production tools for the development of agricultural production and the prospects of agricultural mechanization, and encouraged urban industry to supply various agricultural production materials needed by farmers in large quantities. In the Agricultural Production Improvement Pavilion, it pointed out the direction and future prospects of our agricultural production development, and focused on introducing how to develop and consolidate mutual aid groups, so as to strive to organize all the main labor force of both men and women in the North China region within two or three years. In the Grain Pavilion, it focused on promoting improved varieties and advanced cultivation techniques, and pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously increase the yield per unit area. In the Cotton Pavilion, it emphasized the government's policy of rewarding cotton planting. Special emphasis was placed on increasing the yield per unit area of cotton. In the Disaster Victory Pavilion, it implemented the idea that man can conquer nature and that prevention is more important than cure. In the Drug Pavilion, it pointed out that Western medicine should be localized, Chinese medicine should be scientificized, domestic chemical drugs should be promoted, pill, powder, ointment, and dan prescriptions should be made public, prepared medicines should be promoted to the countryside, the unity of Chinese and Western medicine and the policy of prevention is more important than cure. Other pavilions also implemented different policies according to different situations. Because the policy was clearly explained, it was possible to unify the thoughts and actions of all staff members and promote the work in a planned way.

III. In principle, distinguish the People's Material Exchange Exhibition from the bourgeois exposition. The bourgeois exposition serves a few capitalists, is magnificent, and is flashy but not substantial. Our exhibition serves the people, and its purpose is to educate the people, promote production, and promote material exchange. Because this principle was implemented, the extravagant and wasteful thinking of some comrades was overcome, so that the construction, design, collection, arrangement, and publicity were all realistic, simple, generous, and easy to understand, and basically conformed to the Chinese style. We also critically absorbed the experience of foreign regions based on this principle.

IV. The conference adopted a working method that combines key points and comprehensiveness. In the preparation work, the key points in the first stage were in-depth mobilization, unifying thoughts, establishing institutions, and formulating plans, and the key points in the later stage shifted to site construction and exhibit collection. After the opening, the key points shifted to liaison, reception, and material exchange. This method was implemented in every specific work. For example, in the collection and arrangement of exhibits, the key points were a large number of common things needed for the production and life of urban and rural people and material exchange, such as economic crops such as cotton, white hemp, and oil seeds. Grasping the key points and appropriately taking care of the overall situation can promote the work favorably and comprehensively.

V. In-depth mobilization, meticulous organization, and following the mass line are the keys to the conference's successful completion of its tasks in a short period of time. The conference widely relied on all relevant parties in North China and Inner Mongolia, especially the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, and the people's organizations of Tianjin City (trade unions, youth federations, women's federations, student federations, literary federations, industry and commerce federations, etc.), and used all forms of publicity (radio, publications, lectures, forums, get-togethers, movies, operas, pictures, photography, etc.) to conduct continuous publicity and mobilization to people from all walks of life on the basis of the original work, so as to prepare ideologically for the various tasks of the conference. The conference's publicity, mobilization, and organizational work were all in-depth and meticulous. For example, in site construction, temporary trade unions were organized to mobilize workers to carry out patriotic competitions, so the project was completed quickly. In the reception work, Tianjin citizens were mobilized to vacate 4,000 rooms, and more than 9,000 citizens (about 50% of whom were housewives) voluntarily participated in the reception work, and railway workers, tricycle workers, car workers, tram workers, medical workers, opera workers, shop assistants, students, and bathhouses, restaurants, theaters, etc. were mobilized to enthusiastically serve the conference. At the same time, the conference also involved industrial, agricultural, trade, cooperative, and propaganda departments of the five provinces of North China, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia, and various public and private enterprises and relevant people's organizations; all manpower and material resources had to be drawn from all public and private parties. In the cadre, we constantly overcame the parochial attitude and the idea of being a guest of some comrades. The conference organization was temporary, and it needed to be able to concentrate and unify, and also be able to divide responsibilities and act flexibly, so that each organization could cooperate closely, act consistently, and everyone had something to do and everything was done. Carrying out patriotic work competitions among cadres was also an important condition for maintaining the cadres' working enthusiasm throughout and completing the tasks on schedule. In short, we must mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and organize various forces to carry out the work.

VI. We did a good job in unity. The conference staff came from all aspects: there were urban people, rural people, mountain people, and plain people; there were Communist Party members, members of other democratic parties, and non-party people; there were southern workers and northern workers, there were engineers, art workers, literary workers, experts, students, industrial and commercial circles, and ethnic minority cadres, etc. Their cultural level, political level, work style, and living habits were different, but everyone was very united. This was because the leadership emphasized unity from the beginning, emphasized doing a good job in united front work, emphasized that everyone must be treated equally, but also must be led and used according to the different situations of each staff member, so as to give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity as much as possible, and timely solved some problems that hindered unity, stipulated some systems to strengthen unity (such as work and life review meetings, regular inspection and summary of work, learning system, work competition, etc.), and implemented methods that emphasized encouragement, commendation, and criticism or punishment according to the size of the error.

VII. Timely inspection and good at contacting all parties. This conference has undergone many inspections in the preparation process. In the middle of the preparation work, a team was sent to the five provinces of North China for liaison and inspection, which greatly promoted the progress of the work. Before the opening, under the unified leadership of the General Office of the Conference, relevant units were absorbed to organize a major inspection, which greatly promoted the enrichment of the content of the exhibits, the correction of the policy direction, the improvement of safety and sanitation work, the preparation of liaison and reception work, and the practical implementation of the purchase and sale plan. In the pre-exhibition, according to the valuable opinions of the responsible comrades of the ministries and commissions of the Central People's Government and the provinces and cities of North China and Inner Mongolia, we also carried out several surprise inspections and revisions. Experience has proved that timely inspection is an important condition for the conference to have fewer loopholes and deviations. In addition, we also established closer contact with the relevant ministries and commissions of the central government and the branch committees of the five provinces, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia, and regularly reflected the work situation to them, so that we could get their necessary support and assistance.

Although the conference has ended, the role of the conference is only just beginning. In order to implement the spirit of the conference, we recommend that the relevant departments do the following:

1. Carry out extensive publicity among the urban and rural people to turn all the progressive factors of the conference into the propositions and actions of the broad masses. In the cities, we must carry out the movement to increase production and conserve, and in the countryside, we must carry out the patriotic bumper harvest movement.

2. Only by cashing in on the contracts signed at the conference can we achieve the purpose of organizing material exchange and carrying out production in a planned way. Therefore, it is hoped that the financial and economic committees of major administrative regions and the five provinces and two cities of North China will supervise all units that have signed contracts and agreements at the North China Region Material Exchange Exhibition to ensure that they must abide by contract credit.

In order to ensure that the contracts can be realized, the entire transaction situation and transportation plan must be immediately submitted to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications of the Central Government, so as to request them to allocate railway cars and ships on schedule and in quantity.

3. After visiting the exhibition, farmers generally asked to purchase new agricultural tools, improved varieties, rhizobium inoculants, etc. Therefore, it is hoped that the relevant public and private enterprises can vigorously produce and operate these things. In addition, farmers learned from the exhibition that chicken feathers, bones, rags, old clothes, and broken covers can all be used as industrial raw materials, and they are also eager for someone to purchase them. It is hoped that the cooperative societies at all levels in North China can do their best to undertake this work to increase farmers' income.

4. The exhibits of the conference have been agreed by the five provinces and two cities of North China and Inner Mongolia that, except for individual cases with special reasons, all will be transferred to the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, so as to establish a North China Museum in Tianjin for people from all walks of life to continue to visit and study, and to accumulate materials for research work. The museum is located at the racecourse and is entrusted to the Tianjin Municipal People's Government for management. (Attached picture)

    华北区城乡物资交流展览会工作总结
    （一九五一年十一月二十日华北区城乡物资交流展览会工作委员会最后一次全体委员会议通过）
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会已于十一月二十日胜利闭幕。兹将此次大会的概况、收获、经验和会后各地应作的工作报告如下：
    大会筹备委员会于七月十五日在天津成立，系由中央人民政府华北事务部聘请华北五省二市和内蒙有关部门、工农业劳动模范、工商界代表、少数民族代表等四十七人组成。华北五省、北京和内蒙均随即成立了筹备分会。筹备时间共八十天，用工作人员二千五百人；展出时间共四十五天，用工作人员五千人。大会展品共一万三千种，其中以华北和内蒙为主，并集中了华东、东北、中南、西北、西南五大行政区的主要工业、手工业产品和农、副、土特产品。观众达一百万人。大会热诚地招待了各界人士近四万人，其中包括农民代表近二万人，华北全区的专员、县长，华侨和外宾等。除新疆、西藏没派贸易代表团外，全国各大行政区、各省及重要城市共一百零三个贸易代表团、二千三百多人参加了大会的交易，成交总额达一万五千六百余亿元。在大会宣传委员会的组织领导下，经过报纸、广播、刊物、摄影、讲解及其他的宣传活动，大会意义和内容得到了广泛传播。在安全卫生方面，由于工作人员的高度警惕与努力工作，防止了任何事故的发生，并对生病的代表妥为治疗。大会财政在“取之于会，用之于会，取之合理，用之节约”的方针下，收支相抵，并稍有富余。
    此次大会作用很大，主要收获有以下几点：
    一、对各界观众进行了具体生动的爱国主义教育。此次大会，集中地显示了祖国地大物博的面貌，大规模地检阅了华北工农业生产的光辉成就——工业生产能力已大大超过国民党时期，煤、电力、生铁、钢锭、钢材、纱布等主要工业产品生产量已超过历史上的最高生产水平，农业生产已达到战前水平，并鲜明地反映了美帝国主义“封锁”的破产。这一切，使参观者进一步体会到祖国的伟大可爱，新民主主义制度的优越和以毛主席为首的中央人民政府领导的正确，从而更加增强了保卫祖国，建设祖国和巩固新民主主义制度的决心和信心。比如，许多职工参观后，自动地修订了自己的爱国增产节约计划。许多农民代表表示要积极展开爱国丰产运动，生产更多的粮食、工业原料和出口物资，特别愿把现存棉花卖给国家。华侨看见了祖国地大物博和解放以来各方面突飞猛进的情况后，表现了极大兴奋和愉快。苏联和新民主主义国家的朋友看了之后，更感到人民中国的力量的伟大；某些资本主义国家的来宾参观后，他们不能不改变他们以往认为中国落后的错误看法。
    二、使农民明确了工人阶级为何是领导阶级的道理，加强了工农联盟，密切了城乡人民的关系。农民代表来天津参观前，一般认为“要不是农民种地，谁也吃不上饭，天下又是农民打下的，所以农民应该占领导地位。”“工人在城市，农民在乡下，你干你的，咱干咱的，工农联盟没法联。”不少农村干部虽然执行上级指示，常常以工人阶级是领导阶级来教育农民，但自己心里总不服。经过这次参观展览会、工厂和举行工农联欢会、座谈会后，他们知道工人过去受反动统治阶级压迫最深，故其斗争性也最强；也看到工人阶级是和大生产联系着，有着高度的劳动生产率，坚强的组织性和伟大的创造性。他们便体会到工人有远大的将来，比农民确实先进，而小农经济太落后了。因此，他们便衷心地承认工人阶级是领导阶级。他们说：“咱们过去的生产好像转磨道，不论转上多少年，都前进不了。现在工人生产机器、新式农具、化学肥料，帮助农民改进生产，真是一年一个样儿。将来我们种地也用机器，生活比现在会更好。”他们还从图片中看到苏联集体农庄的优美生活，并从实际中看到城市人民生活是“楼上楼下，电灯电话，地板比自己的炕还干净。”因而，他们感到自己“分了地，住瓦房，有了老婆、孩子、牲口、新式农具和余粮。”并不是“好到顶”了，而是还“差得远”。这就有力地批评了他们的自满保守观点，大大激发了他们进一步组织起来，大力发展生产，逐步走向社会主义的思想。此外，城乡人民的隔阂也进一步打破了。过去许多市民虽然知道农民在革命战争中有丰功伟绩，但总是抽象的；有的人仍旧认为农民“愚昧，落后”。农民来天津前虽然也知道今天的城市是人民的城市，但也很抽象，总有怕“捉土包子”的顾虑；有的下火车时还“紧紧钱包”，“小包袱不离手”。但经过此次热诚的欢迎招待，彼此经过座谈、访问、联欢及其他场合上的诉苦、谈心，相互均认识到过去的城乡对立是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义以城市为据点，长期地残酷剥削农村的结果。现在，人民革命已取得了胜利，以城市为领导的城乡互助的关系已经建立起来，不应当再抱着旧的看法。因此，农民觉得：“城市人民进步真快。毛主席领导的新中国，城里人和乡下人已经成了一家人了。”市民也深感农民进步、勤劳、勇敢、朴实，于是便以招待到农民为荣。彼此感情十分融洽，许多人离别时犹依依难舍。
    三、指出了工农业生产发展的方向和提高技术的重要性。大会在工业上展出了工人阶级七十余种的技术上的改进和创造。如天津自制四缸内燃机引擎、无轨电车、高速柴油机、五百门自动电话交换机，山西自制拖拉机、六十五马力截煤机等；并介绍了许多劳动模范的先进经验，如天津钢厂潘长有热修马丁炉的成功经验，大同煤矿马六孩小组九月（实际工作日二十七天）掘进四百七十九公尺的全国最高纪录，天津恒大烟厂张淑云学习郭瓦廖夫工作方法的成功经验，天津被服厂李兆珍小组分业合作的操作法等。通过这些具体事迹，指出要管好工厂，必须依靠工人阶级，发挥职工群众的高度积极性、创造性，在民主改革和民主管理的基础上，建立科学的管理制度和贯彻经济核算制（如安全负责、生产专责、交接班、集体合同、联系合同、统计检验、车间成本核算、定额管理等制度）。大会还陈列了千百种手工业品，有目的地指导手工业生产的发展，以补机器工业品之不足，并推动机器工业的发展。目前手工业生产上有困难，主要是生产分散、人少、资金小、技术低、质量差、成本高、销不出去。另外工资、工时制度和师徒关系亦有很多不合理，影响生产。故组织起来，改善经营，克服落后性和分散性，并逐渐变为半机器或机器工业，是目前手工业发展的正确道路。在农业方面，明确指出了“组织起来”是农业生产前进的正确道路。有些农民在参观前认为：“过去组织起来，是为解决劳畜力困难，现在困难已解决了，还搞互助组干什么，互助不如单干方便。”但他们在大会上看到所有丰产劳动模范都是走着组织起来的道路后，于是才弄清了组织起来确比单干强，能够合理分工，节省人力，改良技术，便于购置新式农具和举办一家一户所不能作到的事情，能迅速增加生产，走上丰衣足食的道路。农业方面更突出地展出了许多丰产新纪录和新经验，如山西李顺达山地每亩产玉茭九百八十斤，曲耀离每亩棉花产九百二十斤，河北张希舜旱地每亩谷子产一千三百斤，平原王希河每亩小麦产九百斤，平原杨见善每亩水地产春谷八百斤，河北马国荣每亩甘薯产一万斤，绥远党行先每亩马铃薯产八千斤等，并展出了内蒙牧业模范林桑玛和哈音金的增畜保畜的成绩和经验。同时，大会系统地介绍了推广优良品种、战胜灾害、封山育林、发展畜牧等政策和贯彻政策的具体成就。上述农业劳动模范的丰产新纪录和工业劳动模范的改进和创造正是我们进一步提高工农业生产的鲜明旗帜，大大启发了和启发着工人农民的生产的积极性和创造性。而这些劳动模范共同特点是生产与爱国主义相结合，勤劳与提高技术相结合，个人努力与互助合作相结合。许多工人参观后说：“咱们要爱国增产节约，就得边做边研究，想法改进工具机器和工作方法。”农民也认识到：“每亩地要想多打粮食，多产棉花就得动脑筋，用心思，单纯‘死受苦’是不行的。”同时，这些工农劳动模范的成就也向专家、教授、和知识分子指出了正确的前进方向——科学理论与技术必须和群众生产实践相结合，知识分子必须与劳动人民相结合，才能有所成就。我们希望一切专家、教授和知识分子们在与群众生产实践及劳动人民结合上作出更大的成绩来。
    四、有组织地推动了全国性的城乡物资交流，分别解决了各地区的不同贸易要求，促进了工农业生产有计划的发展，从经济上巩固了城乡互助、工农联盟。在一万五千余亿元的成交中，华北和内蒙采购占百分之六十六点一四，推销占百分之八十四点三；其他各大行政区采购占百分之三十三点八六，推销占百分之十五点七。成交总值中，现货、合同占百分之六十八点三二，协议占百分之三十一点六八。不论合同或协议都是经过彼此协商、研讨后才谨慎地订立的。推销中以土、特产品为主，约占百分之六十以上，并为一些滞销品找到了销路，计共销出滞销产品七百余亿元。由于大会贯彻了公私兼顾、互惠两利的交易政策，使物资得到合理分配，并使交易带有很大的政治意义。在交易中，大会首先支持了抗美援朝前卫地区东北区的购货要求；对西南、西北、内蒙等少数民族聚居的地区和西北、华北老根据地及华北灾区，均分别予以适当照顾。华北灾区，要买的都买到，要卖的都卖掉。据统计，察哈尔推销土、特产总值达九千零九十万斤小米；除预售一千万斤白麻外，仍值小米四千零八十九万斤。绥远推销土、特产总值七千六百六十三万斤小米。平原推销灾民土布、草帽辫、口袋等主要手工业品可获利值二千万斤小米。这就有力地支持了灾区人民的生产自救。此外，各地已有的贸易路线进一步巩固了。新的贸易路线又建立了不少，例如华北与中南的药材可以直接交流，中南松香、桐油能销往华北，察哈尔、内蒙麻黄能销往华东等。华北内部的物资交流也比以前更加密切了。例如绥远牲畜销往河北，平原姜片、水烟销往绥远，大批成药下乡等等，都是以前所未有的。通过此次有组织的大规模的成交，大大增强了产销的计划性，减少了盲目性。许多产品的销路、价格、规格都在合同中清楚地规定了，可以有计划地安心生产。例如山西的硫磺，明年的生产品已全部订了合同；察哈尔的白麻已订了一千万斤合同，明年秋后交货。各大行政区之间土特产的供销情况，彼此亦摸清个大概。华北区各种土产的产量、产期、质量、规格、价格、销路等情况，已基本上了解清楚。如没有此次大会，要在短短几个月内了解到这些材料，是不可能的。这些材料，大大便利于我们进一步有计划地指导改进农副业生产和土特产品的产销，避免盲目性。
    五、通过此次交易和展览，城市工商业的商品受到一次群众性的大鉴定，因而明确了工商业改进的方向。即城市工商业者应根据此次农民的意见，进一步面向农村，研究农民的日益发展的需要，积极生产农村迫切需要的生产和生活资料，如新式农具、农药农械、农业加工机器、肥田粉、豆饼、布匹和其他日用工业品。为了便于就地取材生产和就地推销，有些完全供给农村需要的工商业和手工业还可以移入中小城镇或农村去。工商业者必须进一步改进经营方式，克服粗制滥造、投机取巧的恶习，力求产品质量好、价格廉、合适、耐用和供应及时。
    上述情况与收获，说明了此次大会完全达到了预期目的。这一成绩的获得是由于中共中央华北局和中央人民政府华北事务部的正确领导，华北五省、北京和内蒙在深入宣传、征集展品、组织参观、组织贸易代表团等方面，特别是天津市在各方面所给予大会的有力支持，中央各有关部门和各友区的协助，全体工作人员团结一致、积极工作，以及吸取了各地物资交流展览会经验的结果。
    但大会也有不少缺点，主要是：一、由于没有及时地建立一个统一的编审机构，展出材料有些乱，展品有些重复，展览馆也有些多，使观众参观费劲。在展出的材料中，对国营贸易的领导作用显示有些不够，对合作经济在新民主主义经济中的巨大作用，亦显示不足。有些农产品没有标出产地的土壤（如水地、旱地）、气候和价格。对产量大小不同的粮种，没有根据不同地区、土壤、气候等条件，分别加以批判和提倡。有些农具也没有标出价格，有碍推广。二、在交易开始几天，曾普遍存在着“日用工业品缺乏”的空气，并引起了看涨惜售心理，一度影响到大会成交。同时，由于交易所没有设立一个掌握物价的机构和少数商人的投机捣乱，遂发生了所内商品价格高于所外商品价格的现象，这也助长了看涨心理。当时提出了“有买有卖，多买多卖”的方针和“热货换热货，热货带冷货”的办法是正确的，但部分人又机械地认为拿出热货非换回热货不可。这些问题，虽然很快解决了，但已妨碍了成交数字迅速上升。三、由于时间短促，任务紧急和经验缺乏，有些开支稍有欠当之处。四、在招待工作方面，大会开幕后头一礼拜，对吃饭和交通工具等准备均欠充分，致各地农民代表和贸易代表团一度感到不便。
    此次大会有以下主要经验：
    一、开展览会是教育群众、教育干部，推动工作最有效的方式之一。这种方式的好处，是通过具体生动的事物、模型和图表、图画，来说明政策，使理论与实际相结合，便于观众了解，因而可解决单凭理论政治教育所不易解决的问题。这种理论与实际相结合的展览会，不仅可用之于展览城乡物资交流，而且可以同样用之于展览文化、卫生等其他方面，当然规模可大可小，内容可多种多样。
    二、明确方针、政策，是此次大会开好的首要条件。我们首先明确大会的任务主要是推销农、副、土、特产品，特别是滞销品，会场就是市场，大力兜揽生意。这样做，是因为推销了这些东西就能提高农民购买力，改善农民生活，从而为城市工业品开辟了广大的市场，为工业原料扩大了来源。同时明确了贯彻生产方向教育和工农联盟、爱国主义教育。在筹备过程中，我们提出了“省、快、美”的工作方针。在布置中，根据各馆不同情况，贯彻了不同的具体政策。例如工商改进馆内强调“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的新的生产关系如何代替了在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义压迫下的生产关系；强调了生产管理民主化、科学化和依靠工人阶级之重要；强调展出工人阶级的技术上的创造和改进；强调在人民政府领导下私营企业在经营作风、经营方式上的改进。在农业生产资料馆中指出农业生产工具对发展农业生产的重要性与农业机械化前途，鼓励城市工业面向农村大量供应农民所需之各种农业生产资料。在农业生产改进馆中指出了我们农业生产发展的方向及未来的远景，并着重介绍了如何发展与巩固互助组，以便争取两三年内把华北全区男女主要劳动力全组织起来。在粮食馆中着重推广了优良品种和先进的耕作技术，并指出了必须大力提高单位面积产量。在棉花馆中，强调了政府奖励植棉的政策。特别着重提倡了提高棉花单位面积产量。在战胜灾害馆中，贯彻了人定胜天和防重于治的思想。在药物馆里指出了西医要中国化，中医要科学化，要提倡国产化学药品，丸散膏丹药方要公开，推广成药下乡，中西医团结和防重于治的政策。其他各馆，也一样根据不同情况贯彻了不同政策。由于明确交代了政策，故能统一全体工作人员的思想、行动，有计划地推进工作。
    三、把人民物资交流展览会和资产阶级博览会原则上加以区别。资产阶级的博览会是为少数资本家服务的，富丽堂皇，华而不实。我们这个展览会是为人民服务的，它要达到教育人民推动生产和促进物资交流的目的，由于贯彻了这一原则，克服了某些同志的铺张浪费思想，使建筑、设计、征集、布置、宣传等方面均作到了实事求是，朴素大方，通俗易懂，基本上合乎中国气派。对外区经验，我们也是根据这一原则，批判地加以吸取。
    四、大会采取了重点与全面相结合的工作方式。筹备工作中，头一阶段的重点是深入动员，统一思想，建立机构和制订计划，后一阶段重点即转入场地建设和展品征集。开幕后，重点即转移到联络招待和物资交流。在每一具体工作中都贯彻了这一方式。例如在展品征集布置上，重点是大量的、普遍的、为城乡人民生产与生活以及物资交流所需要的东西，如棉花、白麻、油籽等经济作物。抓住重点，与适当地照顾全面，才能有利地、全面地推进工作。
    五、深入动员，细腻组织，走群众路线，这是大会能在短促时间内胜利完成任务的关键。大会广泛地依靠了华北、内蒙各有关方面特别是中共天津市委、天津市人民政府及天津市各人民团体（工会、青联、妇联、学联、文联、工商联等），利用了一切宣传形式（广播、出版、讲演会、座谈会、联欢会、电影、曲艺、图画、摄影等），在原有工作基础上向各界人民进行了持续的宣传动员，从而为大会各项工作作好了思想准备。大会的宣传动员与组织工作都是深入细致的，例如在场地建设上，组织了临时工会，发动工人开展爱国主义竞赛，因而工程很快完成。在招待工作中，动员了天津市民腾出四千来间房子，动员了九千多市民（家庭妇女约占百分之五十）义务参加招待工作，并发动了铁路职工、三轮工人、汽车工人、电车工人、医务工作者、曲艺工作者、店员、学生和澡塘、饭馆、剧场等，热心为大会服务。同时，大会也牵动到华北五省、北京和内蒙工业、农业、贸易、合作、宣传等部门，和各公私企业单位及有关人民团体；一切人力物力均须依靠公私各方抽调出来。在干部中又不断克服了某些同志的本位态度和作客思想。大会机构是临时组成的，既要能集中统一，又要能分工负责，办事灵活，这样各个机构才能密切配合，动作
    一致，人人有事作，事事有人作。在干部中开展爱国主义工作竞赛，也是保持干部工作情绪始终饱满、按期完成任务的一个重要条件。总之，必须发动群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，组织各种力量，才能把工作开展起来。
    六、搞好了团结。大会工作人员来自各方面：有城市的，有农村的，有山地的，有平原的；有共产党员、其他民主党派党员和非党人士；有南方工人和北方工人，有工程师、美术工作者、文艺工作者、专家、学生、工商界和少数民族干部等。他们的文化水平、政治水平、工作作风和生活习惯各不相同，但大家团结得很好。这是因为领导上一开始即强调团结，强调作好统一战线工作，强调必须一视同仁，但也必须根据每个工作人员的不同情况加以领导和使用，以便尽量发挥他们的积极性创造性，并及时解决了妨碍团结的某些问题，规定了一些加强团结的制度（如工作生活检讨会、定期检查总结工作、学习制度、工作竞赛等），实行了着重鼓励、表扬和根据错误大小分别予以批评或处分的办法。
    七、及时检查，善于与各方面联系。此次大会在筹备过程中，进行过多次检查。筹备工作中期，曾派遣小组分赴华北五省进行联络与检查，大大推动了工作的进展。开幕前并在大会办公厅统一领导下，吸收有关单位组织了一次大检查，对展品内容的充实、政策方向的端正、安全卫生工作的改进、联络招待工作的准备、购销计划的切合实际等方面，均起了很大推动作用。在预展中，根据中央人民政府各部、会和华北各省、市及内蒙负责同志的宝贵意见，又突击检查修正了数次。开幕后，仍不断地根据观众的意见检查修正。经验证明：适时检查是大会少出漏洞和偏差的重要条件。另外，也与中央各有关部、会和五省、北京及内蒙分会取得了较密切的联系，经常向他们反映工作情况，故能得到他们必要的支持和协助。
    大会虽已结束，但大会的作用还只是开始。为了把大会精神贯彻下去，我们建议有关部门作好以下事情：
    1、在城乡人民中进行广泛宣传，把大会的一切进步因素变成广大群众的主张和行动。在城市要开展增产节约运动，在农村要开展爱国丰产运动。
    2、只有将大会上所定合同兑现，才能达到组织物资交流和有计划地进行生产的目的。因此，希望各大行政区和华北五省二市的财政经济委员会对所有在华北区物资交流展览会上订定了合同和协议的单位，加以监督，使他们必须遵守合同信用。
    为了使合同能够实现，还必须立即将整个成交情况和运输计划呈中央铁道部和交通部，以便请他们如期如数拨给车皮、船只。
    3、农民参观展览会后，普遍要求购买新式农具、优良品种、根瘤菌拌种剂等。因此，希望有关的公私企业能大力生产与经营这些东西。此外，农民从展览会中知道鸡毛、骨头、破布、烂衣服、烂套子等全能做工业原料之后，也迫切要求有人收购。希望华北各级合作社能把这一工作尽力担负起来，以增加农民的收入。
    4、大会展品，已商得华北五省二市和内蒙的同意，除个别有特殊原因者不留外，全部移交中央人民政府华北事务部，以便在天津成立一个华北博览馆，供各界人士继续参观学习，并积累材料，进行研究工作。博览馆设跑马场，委托天津市人民政府代管。（附图片）
