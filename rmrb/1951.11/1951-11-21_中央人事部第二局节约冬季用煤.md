    The Second Bureau of the Central Personnel Department Conserves Coal for Winter
    The Communist Youth League branch of the Second Bureau of the Central People's Government Personnel Department, in response to Chairman Mao's call to practice strict economy, passed a resolution at a general meeting on November 15th: It suggests that the administration call on all comrades in the bureau to save ten days of coal for heating this winter without affecting their health or hindering their work. This suggestion was immediately supported by the Director of the Second Bureau and enthusiastically endorsed by all comrades, guaranteeing that ten days of coal for heating will be saved this winter. It is estimated that the bureau will save more than 4,000 catties of coal this winter. After this news spread, other units of the Personnel Department also responded enthusiastically.

    中央人事部第二局节约冬季用煤
    新民主主义青年团中央人民政府人事部第二局支部为响应毛主席厉行节约的号召，于十一月十五日在全体大会上通过了一项决议：建议行政上号召全局同志在不影响健康与不妨碍工作的原则下，在今冬节省十天烤火用煤。这项建议立即得到第二局局长的赞助和全体同志的热烈拥护，保证今冬少用十天的烤火用煤。估计全局今冬可节煤四千余斤。这个消息传出后，人事部其他各单位也都纷纷响应。
