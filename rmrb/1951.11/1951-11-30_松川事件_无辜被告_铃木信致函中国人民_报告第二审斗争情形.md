"Matsukawa Incident" Innocent Defendant
Suzuki Nobu Sends Letter to Chinese People
Reporting on Second Trial Struggle

Editor's Note: This newspaper recently received a letter written on November 7th by Suzuki Nobu, an innocent defendant in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," to the Chinese people. Suzuki Nobu, on behalf of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," expressed gratitude to the Chinese people for their support, reported on their struggle in the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident," and appealed to the Chinese people to continue to support their just struggle. The translated text of the original letter is as follows:

To the People's Daily in Beijing, and to the Chinese people:

    On behalf of the twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," I extend to you my heartfelt gratitude, and at the same time report on our determination during the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident," and request your continued and stronger support in the future.

    I gratefully report to you: The extremely precious donation from the people of your country sent to us by Madam Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the China Welfare Institute, through Mr. Fuse Tatsuji, Chairman of the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Association, not only moved us twenty people, but also moved all the Japanese people. At the first public trial on October 23, when the second trial began, someone read out the telegram from the brothers of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union supporting us, which gave us great encouragement.

    In court, more than 140 lawyers and legal scholars, centered on lawyers Fuse Tatsuji, Okabayashi Tatsuo, and Otsuka Kazuo, regardless of their beliefs and positions, unanimously asserted the following points:

    1. The original verdict sentencing the innocent defendants to death is full of deception and completely ignores the truth.

    2. The investigation reports fabricated by means of forced confessions, torture, enticement, and deception violate all objective facts.

    3. These twenty workers have nothing to do with the derailment of the train.

    The unjust imprisonment of us twenty people is clearly a political conspiracy, and even a three-year-old child can determine that we are innocent.

    In order to smash the treasonous verdict of the first trial and to defend justice and truth, we will never succumb to any difficulties; we are learning from your—the Chinese people who heroically fought for liberation—firm will, and firmly launching a death-defying struggle to publicize the truth and expose conspiracies.

    The court is scheduled to announce its decision on December 20 regarding the defense lawyers' request for a re-investigation of the facts.

    We respond to your encouragement of infinite friendship, and at the same time report that the date of the verdict is approaching, and sincerely request your strong support.

    Long live the glorious People's Republic of China!

            Suzuki Nobu, Innocent Defendant in the Matsukawa Incident
                    November 7, 1951

    “松川事件”无辜被告
    铃木信致函中国人民
    报告第二审斗争情形
    编者按：本报最近收到日本“松川事件”无辜被告铃木信十一月七日写给中国人民的一封信，铃木信代表“松川事件”全体无辜被告答谢中国人民对他们的支援，向中国人民报告他们在“松川事件”第二审中斗争的情形，并呼吁中国人民继续支援他们的正义斗争。原信译文如下：北京人民日报转中国人民诸君：
    我代表“松川事件”二十名无辜被告向你们敬致衷心的感谢，同时报告在“松川事件”第二审进行中我们的决心，并请求今后给予我们更强有力的支持。
    我感激地报告你们：日前中国人民救济总会宋庆龄主席经由日本劳农救援会主席布施辰治寄给我们的极其珍贵的贵国人民的救援捐款，不仅使我们二十人感激，同时也激动了全体日本人民。在十月二十三日第二审开始的第一次公审法庭上，有人朗读了中国铁路工会弟兄们支援我们的电报，给了我们极大的鼓励。
    在法庭上，以布施辰治、冈林辰雄、大冢一男律师为中心的一百四十余名律师、法学家，不论他们的信仰和立场是如何不同，一致主张了下列各点：
    一、给无辜被告以死刑的原判决，充满欺骗，完全忽视了真理。
    二、用逼供、拷问、诱惑、欺骗等手段伪造的调查书，是违背了一切客观事实的。
    三、这二十名工人和列车出事颠覆毫无关系。
    我们二十人的冤狱，明明白白是政治阴谋的事件，即使三岁孩童也能判明我们是无罪的。
    我们为了粉碎第一审的卖国判决，为了保卫正义与真理，对任何困难决不屈服；我们学习你们——为了争取解放而英雄地战斗的中国人民的坚决意志，坚定地展开宣传真理、揭发阴谋的决死斗争。
    对于辩护律师提出的重新调查事实的请求，裁判所方面定于十二月二十日宣布裁决。
    我们答复你们无限友情的鼓励，同时报告判决日期已经迫近，并诚挚地请求你们强有力的支持。
    光辉的中华人民共和国万岁！
            松川事件无辜被告铃木信
                    一九五一年十一月七日
