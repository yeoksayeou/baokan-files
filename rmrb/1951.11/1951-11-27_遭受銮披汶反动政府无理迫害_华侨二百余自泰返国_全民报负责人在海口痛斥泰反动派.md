Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 26th: A total of 264 overseas Chinese, persecuted by the reactionary Phibun Phibunsongkhram government of Thailand, returned to Shantou and Haikou in two batches on October 25th and November 24th. The returned overseas Chinese were warmly cared for by the overseas Chinese affairs agencies in Shantou and Haikou, and have been properly resettled.

These returned overseas Chinese were unreasonably detained in prisons and immigration detention centers by the Phibun Phibunsongkhram government under the pretext of "Thailand doesn't need them," loss of "identification documents," or other "crimes." After enduring a long period of abuse and a dark life, they were deported. Upon returning to the motherland, the returned overseas Chinese successively accused the Phibun Phibunsongkhram government of its atrocities in unreasonably persecuting overseas Chinese. He Nan, a rubber tapper who had been imprisoned for as long as three years, said: Thai police in the prison often acted fiercely and beat people. At the end of last year, an overseas Chinese compatriot in his sixties was beaten to death by a gang. In February of last year, two returned overseas Chinese who had been sentenced to deportation were abused to death in prison. The returned overseas Chinese, Liang Yeji, said: The imprisoned returned overseas Chinese were forced to do hard labor, and even a frail and sick old man of seventy-eight was no exception. The returned overseas Chinese also revealed that some of the returned overseas Chinese detained in the immigration detention center committed suicide because they could not bear the persecution, and some became mentally disturbed as a result of the shock.

Before these returned overseas Chinese returned to China, the vast number of overseas Chinese in Thailand raised travel expenses for them. In about half a month, more than 500,000 Thai baht were raised. This fully demonstrates the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among overseas Chinese in Thailand.
Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, November 26th: Cai Zhihong, editor-in-chief of the Bangkok "Quan Min Bao," and Wu Jianzhong, publisher, arrived in Haikou on the 24th. They were unreasonably arrested by the reactionary Phibun Phibunsongkhram government of Thailand on January 30th this year on the "crime" of publishing news of the local overseas Chinese anti-American and patriotic movement, and were illegally deported on November 15th. Representatives from the Haikou Municipal People's Government, overseas Chinese affairs agencies, and people's organizations went to the pier to welcome them and held a reception to express their condolences.

Cai and Wu expressed their feelings to the Haikou press, saying: "We were unreasonably imprisoned by the reactionary Phibun Phibunsongkhram government of Thailand for nine and a half months, and were illegally deprived of our legitimate right to reside in Thailand. The Thai Phibun Phibunsongkhram government, which completely relies on American imperialism, is intensifying its persecution of the 3.5 million overseas Chinese residing in Thailand under the direction of its master, and the various sufferings endured by the overseas Chinese are becoming increasingly serious. However, inspired, cared for, and supported by our great motherland, the overseas Chinese in Thailand will surely be able to further unite, fight to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, and contribute their strength to the prosperity and strength of the motherland."

    遭受銮披汶反动政府无理迫害
    华侨二百余自泰返国
    全民报负责人在海口痛斥泰反动派
    【新华社广州二十六日电】被泰国銮披汶反动政府迫害的华侨共二百六十四名，分两批在十月二十五日和十一月二十四日自泰国返抵汕头和海口市。难侨们受到汕头和海口侨务机关亲切的照顾，并已得到妥善的安置。
    这些难侨是被銮披汶政府以“泰国不需要”、失落“随身证”或其他“罪名”无理地拘禁在监狱和移民局拘留所里，过了长期受虐待的黑暗生活以后，又被驱逐出境的。回到祖国的难侨们纷纷控诉銮披汶政府无理迫害华侨的暴行。曾被囚禁达三年之久的割胶工人何南说：监狱里的泰国警察经常逞凶打人，前年底有一位六十多岁的侨胞被围殴致死。去年二月间又有两位被判出境的难侨被虐待死在狱中。难侨梁也基说：被囚禁的难侨都被迫作苦役，连一位七十八岁的体弱患病的老汉也不能例外。难侨们并揭露：被囚禁在移民局拘留所的难侨，有的因不堪迫害而自杀，有的因受刺激而神经失常。
    在这些难侨回国之前，泰国广大侨胞曾为他们筹募旅费，在约半个月时间内，即募得泰币五十万铢以上。这充分表现了泰国华侨的团结互助精神。 【新华社海口二十六日电】曼谷“全民报”总编辑蔡志宏和出版人吴建中于二十四日抵达海口市，他们是在今年一月三十日被泰国銮披汶反动政府以刊登当地华侨反美爱国运动的新闻的“罪名”无理地加以逮捕，又在十一月十五日非法地加以驱逐出境的。海口市人民政府、侨务机关和人民团体都派了代表到码头欢迎，并举行招待会慰问他们。
    蔡、吴二人对海口新闻界发表感想说：“我们被泰国銮披汶反动政府无理禁锢了九个半月，并被非法地剥夺了居留泰国的正当权利。完全投靠美帝国主义者的泰国銮披汶政府在它的主子的指使下，对居留泰国的三百五十万华侨的迫害正日益加紧，侨胞们所受的种种苦难也日益严重。但是，在我们伟大祖国的鼓舞、爱护和支援下，泰国的华侨一定能够进一步团结起来，为维护自己的正当权益而斗争，并为祖国的繁荣和富强而贡献出他们的力量。”
