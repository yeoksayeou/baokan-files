    Ambush
    Hong Yi Kang Kai
    On the night of October 5th, a platoon of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army laid a three-mile-long bag-shaped ambush net in the hilly area of ​​the central line.
    At about nine o'clock on the morning of the next day, the soldiers saw an enemy reconnaissance plane flying low for four or five circles in the distance, and then the enemy infantry swaggered forward. The soldiers were nervous but calm in their preparations.
    Deputy squad leader Wang Naiwen, who was with the outpost group, saw that thirty enemies had already passed and thought, "That's about enough." He was about to jump out of the fortifications when he suddenly saw six enemies following closely behind, carrying a heavy machine gun and a rocket launcher. He immediately changed his mind: "Let's take out these guys first." He waited until these six enemies were no more than thirty meters away from him, then suddenly jumped out of the fortifications and went straight to the enemy. The enemy did not expect this move. As they were about to act, Wang Naiwen's submachine gun bullets had already swept over their bodies. At this time, the soldiers of my outpost group also bravely jumped out of the fortifications and swept the enemies behind with submachine guns.
    As soon as the outpost group opened fire, all the combatants of the platoon immediately joined the battle. At that time, an enemy commander was waving to the rear in a panic. Volunteer Army Platoon Leader Huang gave an order, and machine gun bullets swept over like a gust of wind, immediately killing the commander. When the American soldiers saw that the commander had been knocked down, they panicked and fled in all directions, leaving heavy machine guns, automatic rifles, radios, etc. on the ground. Platoon Leader Huang seized this opportunity and ordered the entire platoon to attack. Squad Leader Hao Yonglou led a squad and quickly chased after the retreating enemy. Soldier Zhang Zhenbang used a newly captured automatic rifle to block a small bridge on the road, shooting one enemy for every one who passed. At this time, fierce artillery fire from our position also cooperated to bombard the chaotic enemy.
    Deputy Platoon Leader Song Shiwu then alertly ordered the second squad leader to tighten the mouth of the ambush circle, and he led the machine gun squad to the southernmost point to prepare to block the enemy's reinforcements. When the enemy reinforcements came, Song Shiwu led the soldiers to strike at the enemy's reinforcements, making it impossible for the enemy to advance an inch.
    After two hours of fighting, two platoons of the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion, 24th Regiment, 25th Division of the US Army, were mostly wiped out by us except for a few who escaped. The soldiers escorted the prisoners and carried the captured six machine guns and other weapons, returning to the position with joy.

    伏击战
    洪毅  康凯
    十月五日深夜，中国人民志愿军某部一个排在中线某处丘陵地带，撒下了三里路长的袋形伏击网。
    第二天九点钟光景，战士们见到敌人一架侦察机在远处低飞了四五圈后，敌人的步兵便大摇大摆地前进了。战士们就紧张而又沉着地准备着。
    带着前哨组的副班长王乃文看到敌人已经过去了三十个，心里想：“差不多了。”他正待跳出工事，突然又看见后面紧跟着六个敌人，抬着一挺重机枪和一门火箭筒。他立即改变了主意：“先干掉这些吧。”他等到这六个敌人离自己不过三十公尺时，蓦地纵身跳出工事，直奔到敌人面前。敌人没有防到这一着，正想动手，王乃文的冲锋枪子弹早已拍拍地扫到了他们的身上。这时，我前哨组的战士们也都奋勇跳出工事，端起冲锋枪向后面的敌人猛扫。
    前哨组一打响，全排战斗人员立即投入了战斗。当时有一个敌人指挥官在惊慌地向后面招手，志愿军的黄排长一声命令，机关枪子弹像一阵风似地扫了过去，立刻把那个指挥官打死了。美国士兵们一看指挥官被打倒了，惊慌失措地四散乱窜，把重机枪、自动步枪、报话机等都扔在地上。黄排长抓住了这一战机，命令全排出击。八班长郝永楼带着一个小组，飞快地向着溃退的敌人追去。战士张振邦用一支刚缴到的自动步枪，封锁住公路上的一座小桥，过一个敌人他就打一个。这时，从我方阵地上发出的猛烈的炮火，也配合着轰击溃乱的敌群。
    副排长宋士武这时又机警地命令二班长收紧伏击圈的袋口，自己带着机枪组跑到最南面，准备阻击敌人的援兵。当敌人援兵来时，宋士武带着战士打击着敌军的增援，使敌寸步难进。
    经过两小时的战斗，美军第二十五师第二十四团三营七连的两个排，除少数人逃走外，绝大部分被我消灭了。战士们押着俘虏，扛着缴获的六挺机关枪和其它武器，喜气洋洋地返回了阵地。
