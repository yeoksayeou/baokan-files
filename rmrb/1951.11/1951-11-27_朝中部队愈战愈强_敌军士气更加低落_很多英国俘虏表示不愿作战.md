[Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th] Our front-line reporter reports: The fierce battles of the past month or more have shown that the fighting strength of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies is growing stronger and stronger; and conversely, the morale of the enemy is even lower. British Commonwealth Division soldier Patrick Landon, captured by our army in the counterattack on Maryang-san on the 4th of this month, told reporters: "In the increasingly terrible battles, one of my deepest feelings is that you (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Armies) are stronger than before. I am very surprised that when we attacked you, we used so many planes, artillery, and tanks, but it was like hitting a mountain of steel; and when you attacked us, we could hardly resist." Another prisoner, John McGlory, said: "The intensity of your artillery fire is something we have never seen or imagined. Also, your attacks come so suddenly. We have never heard of the Chinese attacking during the day. Even if we made more preparations, I believe we would still fail." Soldier Dennis recalled the situation before he was captured: "The officers ordered us to hold the position; but as soon as your artillery fired, these smug guys disappeared, even the sergeant who commanded our machine gun slipped away. Later, your artillery fire became more and more intense, and we longed for our own planes and artillery to support us, but as a result, our artillery was destroyed by your artillery. Dozens of planes came, but more than a dozen were shot down or damaged, and the rest fled quickly. When your artillery fire stopped, as soon as I raised my head, your soldiers with bayonets were already pointing at our chests. The three of us in the group didn't even fire a shot and became prisoners."

Sergeant Yuen, who had eighteen years of military service, was captured by a wounded warrior of our counterattack force. He said: "When your warrior rushed over with a bayonet, the six of us quickly put our guns on the ground, which saved our lives. When he was taken to your rear by us, we realized that his left arm had been injured when the doctor took off his clothes to bandage him. We can't find such brave people in our troops."

Many of these British prisoners expressed their unwillingness to fight in Korea for the American aggressors. Soldier Lauterick Munro, who participated in World War II, said: "We were brave at that time because we knew it was an anti-fascist war; but I don't know why we came to fight in Korea this time." The morale of British soldiers is low. For example, in the First Company of the Scottish Borderers, seven soldiers injured themselves within five days. John McGlory said: "When we saw the slogans posted on your positions, 'Your relatives are waiting for you to go home with tears in their eyes!' many of us really shed tears. Later, we read your leaflets, 'Surrender is the way to live, the hilltops are graves!' and we made up our minds. This time, before you even attacked the top of the hill, I was already prepared to surrender because I knew that you would treat those who lay down their weapons leniently."

    朝中部队愈战愈强
    敌军士气更加低落
    很多英国俘虏表示不愿作战 【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者报道：在最近一个多月的激烈战斗中显示出，朝中人民军队的战斗力是愈来愈强大了；而相反地，敌军的士气却更加低落了。本月四日我军在反击马良山的战斗中俘获的英军联邦师士兵派立克·兰登对记者说：“在愈来愈可怕的战斗中，我的一个最深刻的感觉就是你们（指朝中人民军队）比过去更加强大了。我很奇怪，我们向你们进攻时，用了那么多的飞机、大炮和战车，但都好像碰在钢山上一样；而你们向我们进攻时，我们简直难以抵抗。”另一个俘虏约翰·麦克劳雷说：“你们的炮火的猛烈程度是我们从来没有见过，也没有想像过的。另外，你们的进攻实在来得太突然了。我们从来没有听到过中国人会在白天进攻的。即使我们再作更多的准备，我相信我们仍然是要失败的。”士兵但尼斯回忆他被俘以前的情形说：“长官命令我们一定要守住阵地；但是你们的大炮一响，这些神气十足的家伙全不见了，连指挥我们这挺机关枪的中士也溜走了。后来你们的炮火愈来愈猛，我们就渴望着自己的飞机、大炮来支援，但结果我们的大炮被你们的大炮击毁了。数十架飞机来了也被你们打落、打伤了十几架，剩下来的都迅速逃走了。等到你们的炮火一停，我刚抬起头来，你们的士兵端着刺刀已对准了我们的胸膛。我们组的三个人连一枪也没放，就当了俘虏。”
    有着十八年军龄的中士尤恩是被我反击部队的一个已经负伤的战士俘掳的。他说：“你们的战士端着刺刀扑过来的时候，我们六个人赶快把枪放在地上，才算保全了生命。当他把我们带到你们的后方，医生给他脱衣包扎的时候，我们才知道他的左臂已经受了伤。像这样勇敢的人，我们部队中是找不到的。”
    这些英国俘虏中很多人表示不愿为美国侵略者在朝鲜作战。曾参加过第二次世界大战的士兵劳特立克·孟洛说：“那时候我们是勇敢的。因为我们知道：那是反法西斯的战争；但是这次为什么来朝鲜作战，我不知道。”英国士兵士气低落。如苏格兰边防团第一连在五天内就有七个士兵自伤。约翰·麦克劳雷说：“当看到贴在你们阵地上的标语‘你们的亲人含着眼泪等待着你回家！’我们中间有很多人真的流泪了。后来我们又看了你们发的‘投降是活路，山头是坟墓！’的传单，心里就想定了主意。这次当你们还没有攻上山顶的时候，我早就准备投降了。因为我知道你们对放下武器的人是会给予宽待的。”
