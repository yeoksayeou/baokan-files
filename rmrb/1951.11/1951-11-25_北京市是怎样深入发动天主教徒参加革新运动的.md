    How Beijing Deeply Mobilized Catholics to Participate in the Reform Movement
    Liu Ming
    Beijing has approximately 20,000 Catholics, over 200 Chinese and foreign priests, and about 2,000 Catholics and priests who participated in reactionary organizations such as the "Legion of Mary." When the reform movement began in May of this year, imperialist elements spread rumors among Catholics to undermine the reform movement, and patriotic Catholics were attacked. If a Catholic expressed patriotism or support for the Communist Party, some priests would say he had "committed a sin and would go to hell." After several months of the reform movement, the various crimes of imperialist elements and their running dogs have been thoroughly exposed by Catholics. Reactionary elements colluding with imperialist elements have become isolated among Catholics. A large number of patriotic activists have emerged among Catholics, uniting the broad masses of Catholics and resolutely fighting against imperialist elements and their running dogs.

    The reason why Catholics in Beijing have such a patriotic consciousness today is that patriotic and democratic elements within Catholicism have conducted in-depth patriotic education and arduous mass work among Catholics.

    The steps taken by Beijing's Catholic Church to mobilize Catholics were: conducting patriotic education for Catholics; launching accusation movements; and establishing a reform movement committee after the majority of Catholics had a patriotic and anti-imperialist consciousness and a sufficient number of activists had emerged.

    Starting in May of this year, under the call and guidance of the Anti-American Aid Korea branches in various districts and with the help of various mass organizations, reform movement study groups were universally organized, initiated by patriotic Catholics. During the study sessions, the Municipal Anti-American Aid Korea Sub-Committee distributed materials exposing the activities of imperialist elements using religion for aggression, as well as articles on religious reform issues, which had been revealed throughout the country. Through reports, forums, and discussions, the various ideological concerns of Catholics were dispelled. Through the actual life experiences of Catholics and the crimes of imperialist elements and reactionary elements known to them, the patriotic and anti-imperialist consciousness of Catholics was raised. Activists were discovered and cultivated during the study, and under their leadership and influence, an accusation movement against imperialist elements and reactionary elements was launched. Launching an accusation movement among Catholics is an effective way to free Catholics from the influence of imperialist elements and draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy. For example, at the accusation meeting held on June 23, attended by more than 5,000 Catholics from the city, many children from the "Home of Benevolence" accused imperialism of the crime of harming Chinese children. Catholics cried in the hall. Some Catholics said, "They (imperialist elements) hang the sign of heavenly officials bestowing blessings, but they do things that are male prostitution, female adultery, murder, and homicide." Zhang Shulan, a Catholic who lived in the Home of Benevolence for more than ten years, had scars all over her body where she had been beaten by foreign nuns. Zhang Shulan has repeatedly made accusations at Catholic mass meetings. Large and small accusation meetings have been held many times in various districts, churches, and study groups. Catholics from various districts and churches also sent each other to visit and learn. The advanced districts promoted the backward districts.

    The study and accusations of Catholics were carried out in sharp and tense struggle with imperialist elements and their running dogs. From the beginning of organizing Catholics to study, imperialist elements and their running dogs used various methods to exploit loopholes, find excuses, spread rumors and sabotage, win over, attack, and use money to buy off Catholics. When foreign priests at the Furen Church heard that Catholics were accusing them, they sent rice and coal to the Catholics, saying, "This is the benevolence of God." They went everywhere to persuade parishioners to recite scriptures and pray more, using strengthening religious life to resist the reform movement. Imperialist elements also sent out pawns to carry out activities everywhere, openly disrupting parishioners' studies; some superficially supported reform but secretly carried out sabotage. Patriotic Catholics and cadres who helped with the study were constantly researching and understanding the enemy's situation, uniting the Catholic masses to fight against imperialist elements.

    Through study and accusation, Catholics solved the following problems: (1) At the beginning, Catholics believed the ghost stories spread by imperialist elements that "reform is the destruction of religion." During the study, everyone has seen from practical actions that reform does not hinder everyone's freedom of religious belief, but only prevents them from being deceived by imperialism. They said, "I have believed in religion for many years, but I originally believed in imperialism!" "Reform has brought me from a dark room to the sunlight!" (2) They believed that "priests are the messengers of God. Even if they do bad things, Catholics cannot say anything, otherwise they will violate religious rules and lose their souls." But in the accusation, everyone heard about the crimes of foreign priests hiding weapons, setting up radio stations to communicate intelligence with imperialism, raping women, and seizing property, as well as the fact that the "Home of Benevolence" killed countless Chinese children. Only then did they recognize their reactionary and traitorous true colors. Some Catholics said, "Don't talk about the soul, I have to fight them to the end even if I don't want my body!" "It turns out that they are playing the card of God, and only doing the evil deeds of demons. It is these bad guys who should go to hell!" (3) Many Catholics were deceived by imperialist elements in the past, did not believe in the Communist Party and the People's Government, and only knew how to love religion but not how to love the country. Now, when donating airplanes and artillery, they not only donate more themselves, but also go everywhere to promote it to others. At the request of the broad masses of Catholics, some Chinese priests have now begun to conduct patriotic propaganda to Catholics every time they hold a worship service.

    On the basis of the patriotic and anti-imperialist consciousness of the broad masses of Catholics, many churches in the city have established relatively solid reform committee organizations. Activists who emerged in the study and accusation have become the backbone of the reform committee. At the Municipal Catholic Representatives Conference held in September, the Beijing Municipal Catholic Reform Committee was established.

    At present, the reform committee organization is further mobilizing Catholics to thoroughly expose the imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements within the church, destroy various reactionary organizations within the church, and further conduct in-depth patriotic education for Catholics.

    Xu Wenlu, a priest from the Xitang Catholic Church in Beijing, under the influence of patriotic Catholics and with the help of the reform committee, often conducts current affairs propaganda to Catholic masses after Mass.

    北京市是怎样深入发动天主教徒参加革新运动的
    刘明
    北京市约有天主教徒二万余人，中外神甫约二百余人，教徒和神甫参加“圣母军”等反动组织的约两千人。在今年五月间革新运动开始时，帝国主义分子在教徒中间散布谣言，破坏革新运动，爱国教徒受到打击。教徒们有谁表示要爱国、要拥护共产党，有的神甫就说他“犯了罪，要下地狱”。经过几个月来的革新运动，帝国主义分子及其走狗的各种罪行已被教徒们彻底揭露出来。和帝国主义分子相勾结的反动分子在教徒中间已经孤立了。在教徒中间则涌现了大批爱国的积极分子，他们团结了广大教徒，坚决和帝国主义分子及其走狗进行斗争。
    北京市的天主教徒所以能有今天这样的爱国觉悟，是因为天主教中的爱国民主分子曾在教徒中间进行了深入的爱国主义教育和艰苦的群众工作。
    北京市天主教发动教徒的步骤是：向教徒进行爱国主义教育；开展控诉运动；在大多数教徒有了爱国反帝的觉悟，并涌现了足够的积极分子之后，即成立革新运动委员会。
    自今年五月开始，在各区抗美援朝支会号召与指导及各群众团体的帮助之下，由爱国教徒发起，普遍组织了革新运动的学习小组。在学习时，市抗美援朝分会印发了全国各地所揭露的帝国主义分子利用宗教进行侵略活动的材料，和一些关于宗教革新问题的文章。经过作报告、座谈、讨论，解除教徒的各种思想顾虑，通过教徒的实际生活体验和他们所熟知的帝国主义分子及反动分子的罪行，提高了教徒的爱国反帝觉悟。在学习中发现和培养了积极分子，并在他们的带动和影响之下，开展了对帝国主义分子及反动分子的控诉运动。在教徒中开展控诉运动，是使教徒摆脱帝国主义分子的影响、划清敌我界线的有效办法。如在六月二十三日召开的有全市五千多教徒参加的控诉大会上，有很多“仁慈堂”的儿童控诉帝国主义残害中国儿童的罪行。教徒们在会场上哭成一片。有的教徒说：“他们（帝国主义分子）挂的是天官赐福的牌子，作的是男盗女娼、杀人害命的事情。”教徒张淑兰在仁慈堂住了十几年，她身上手上到处是被外国修女们打坏的伤疤。张淑兰曾到处在教徒群众会上进行控诉。各区各教堂各学习组，曾多次举行了大型和小型的控诉会。各区和各教堂之间并互派教徒参观学习。前进的区推动了落后的区。
    教徒们的学习和控诉，是在和帝国主义分子及其走狗的尖锐和紧张的斗争中进行的。从组织教徒学习开始，帝国主义分子及其走狗们就用各种方法钻空子、找藉口、造谣破坏，拉拢、打击以及用金钱收买教徒。辅仁教堂的外国神甫听到有教徒控诉他们，就给教徒送米、送煤，说“这是天主的仁爱”。他们到处去劝教友多念经，多祷告，用加强宗教生活来抵制革新运动。帝国主义分子并派出爪牙到处活动，在教友们学习时公开捣乱；有的则表面拥护革新，暗中进行破坏。爱国的教徒和帮助学习的干部，随时都在研究、了解敌人的情况，团结教徒群众和帝国主义分子进行斗争。
    经过学习和控诉，教徒们解决了这样几个问题：（一）开始时教徒们都相信帝国主义分子散布的“革新就是灭教”的鬼话。在学习中大家已经从实际行动中看到，革新毫不妨碍大家的信教自由，只是不要再受帝国主义的欺骗。他们说：“我信教多年，原来是信了帝国主义！”“革新把我从黑屋子里带到太阳光下面了！”（二）认为“神甫是天主的使者，他作了坏事，教徒也不能说，说了要犯教规，丢掉灵魂”。但是在控诉中，大家听到外国神甫私藏武器，设电台和帝国主义通情报，强奸妇女，霸占财产等罪行，以及“仁慈堂”害死无数中国儿童等事实，这才认清了他们的反动卖国的真面目。有的教徒说：“别说灵魂，我不要肉体也得和他拼到底！”“原来他们打着天主的牌子，净干些魔鬼的恶事，该下地狱的正是这些坏蛋！”（三）很多教徒过去受了帝国主义分子的欺骗，不相信共产党和人民政府，只知爱教，不知爱国。现在在捐献飞机大炮时，不但自己多捐，还要到处向别人进行宣传。在广大教徒的要求下，现在有的中国神甫在每次作礼拜时，也开始向教徒进行爱国主义的宣传了。
    在广大教徒爱国反帝的觉悟基础上，全市不少教堂都成立了比较巩固的革新委员会的组织。在学习和控诉中涌现出来的积极分子则成为革新委员会的骨干。在九月间召开的全市天主教代表会议上，成立了北京市天主教革新委员会。
    目前，革新委员会的组织正进一步发动教徒彻底检举教内的帝国主义分子和反革命分子，摧毁教会内的各种反动组织，并进一步深入地向教徒进行爱国主义教育。
    北京市天主教西堂神甫徐文禄，在爱国教徒的影响和革新委员会的帮助之下，经常在作弥撒后，向教徒群众进行时事宣传。
