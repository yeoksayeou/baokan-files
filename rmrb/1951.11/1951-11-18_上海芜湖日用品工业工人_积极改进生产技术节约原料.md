To provide the broad masses of peasants with inexpensive and high-quality industrial products, the daily necessities industry in Shanghai is not only greatly increasing production, but also constantly improving quality and reducing costs. In the match industry, in the past, about 6 to 10 percent of matches in each box were defective, and 1 to 2 percent had double heads; now, defective matches have been reduced to below 4 percent, and double-headed matches are basically gone. The Great China Match Company has appropriately reduced the production of the more expensive "Beauty Brand" matches and used more raw materials to increase the production of the lower-priced "Shanghai Brand" matches, which are popular with farmers. As a result of these improvements, 80 to 90 percent of the total sales of matches in East China are now sold in rural areas. In the cigarette industry, the output of Grade B and Grade C cigarettes in October has increased to over 91 percent of the total output of the cigarette industry; the output of lower-quality Grade D cigarettes has been reduced to only about 5 percent. In order to reduce costs, cigarette factories have generally increased the production of simply packaged cigarettes. Simply packaged cigarettes accounted for 20 percent of the total output of the cigarette industry in August, and this has increased to 30.5 percent in October. In the soap industry, which is enjoying booming production and sales, all factories had fully utilized their equipment for producing scented soap by September in order to meet the needs of farmers in Northeast China and other regions for scented soap. The Gu Ben Soap produced by the Wu Zhou Pharmacy has further improved its quality, and its moisture content has been reduced by 2 percent. Enamel factories have successively stopped manufacturing products that were originally for export, such as coffee pots and milk cups, and have switched to producing mouthwash cups, rice bowls, washbasins, and other daily necessities needed by workers, peasants, and soldiers; as a result, sales have expanded. The output of washbasins this autumn increased by 72.7 percent compared to the same period last year, and the output of enamel sundries such as mouthwash cups and rice bowls also increased by 43.4 percent. Bamboo-shell thermos bottles, which are deeply welcomed by the broad masses of peasants, have recently accounted for more than 75 percent of the total output of thermos bottles of various colors.

In order to reduce costs and increase production, daily necessities factories have paid attention to improving production technology and conserving raw materials. For example, the Ying Chang, Zheng Feng, and Li Ming match factories saved 1,259 kilograms of potassium chlorate and 58,519 bundles of matchsticks in September. The value of savings made by employees of the Jiangnan Paper Mill also increased from over 35 million yuan in July to over 110 million yuan in August. Workers at the Hua Cheng Cigarette Factory created an automatic stopping machine, which greatly reduced the loss of cigarette paper. Workers at the China Industrial Thermos Bottle Factory improved the drying cylinder, increasing the number of bottle bladders dried per hour from 96 to 212, while also saving more than 12 degrees of gas per day.

　　Wuhu Match Factory has made saving raw materials and reducing waste a regular mass movement. Since launching the patriotic labor competition in December last year, the factory has listed saving raw materials and reducing costs as the main content of the competition; after the mass movement of signing and revising patriotic covenants, the work of saving raw materials has become more specific and substantial.

　　During the inspection in July, the factory completed all the savings items stipulated in the patriotic covenant, and some even exceeded them by a lot. The cutting group reached the regulation of "knife head (waste material) not exceeding one inch," and the double-headed matches (defective products) of the oil stove group decreased from 0.99 jin per piece (one thousand boxes) to 0.33 jin. The most outstanding achievement was made by the boxing group. The patriotic covenant originally stipulated that the box breakage rate should not exceed one in 240, but the actual box breakage rate of the group has been reduced to one in a thousand. After July, the employees of each unit of the factory revised the patriotic covenant. They also strived for greater savings achievements from improving and upgrading technology. The knife head left by the cutting group during cutting has been shortened to less than one inch, and if it is shortened further, the cutting knife will not be able to exert force. Worker Chen Zongwen later came up with a solution: he intentionally left the stem head longer, and then mixed the cutting head in the new long film to cut, so that the knife head was fully utilized. Each box of medicine in the medicine dipping group could originally only dip eight carts (30 rows of match sticks per cart) of matches. After research, the workers in the group discovered a principle, that is, when the medicine dipping reaches the end, the medicine consumption will increase as the dipping temperature decreases and the volume shrinks. In order to reduce the consumption of medicine, they try to keep the dipping medicine at a certain temperature. As a result, the matches dipped per box of medicine have been increased from eight carts to nine and a half to ten carts. Other production units have also made improvements. For example, the box breakage rate of the boxing group has been reduced from one in a thousand to one in seven thousand.

　　The factory's work of saving raw materials is of great significance for promoting the reduction of waste in important raw materials such as wood and potassium chlorate in various places. The results of the saving of the cutting, dipping, boxing, and sealing units in the factory over the past year have reduced the manufacturing cost of the factory's products by about 9 percent.

　　上海芜湖日用品工业工人
    积极改进生产技术节约原料
    为使广大农民得到价廉物美的工业用品，上海市日用品工业不仅大量增加生产，而且正在不断提高质量，减低成本。火柴工业，过去每盒火柴中约有百分之六到十是废梗，百分之一到二是双头梗；现在废梗已减低到百分之四以下，双头梗已基本上没有了。大中华火柴公司已适当地减少了较贵的“美丽牌”火柴的产量，将更多原料用于增产价格较低的为农民所乐用的“上海牌”火柴。由于这些改进，华东全区火柴的总销售量中，已有百分之八十到九十的产品行销于农村。在卷烟工业方面，十月份乙级和丙级烟的产量已提高到卷烟业总产量的百分之九十一强；品质较差的丁级烟减少到仅占百分之五左右。为了减低成本，各烟厂普遍增加了简装烟的生产。今年八月份简装烟占卷烟业总产量的百分之二十，到十月份已提高到百分之三十点五。产销两旺的肥皂工业，为了满足东北等地农民对香皂的需要，各厂生产香皂的设备至九月份已全部开足。五洲大药房出产的固本肥皂，由于进一步提高了品质，所含水分已减少了百分之二。搪瓷工业各厂已先后停制原来外销的产品如咖啡壶、牛奶杯等，改产工农大众日常所需的口杯、饭碗、面盆等；因此销路扩大。今年秋季的面盆产量较去年同期增加了百分之七十二点七，口杯、饭碗等搪瓷杂料也增加了百分之四十三点四。深受广大农民欢迎的竹壳热水瓶，最近产量已占到各色热水瓶总产量的百分之七十五以上。
    为了降低成本，增加生产，日用品工业各厂已注意改进生产技术，节约原料材料。如火柴工业荧昌、正丰、黎明等三家火柴厂，九月份节约的氯酸钾就有一千二百五十九公斤，火柴梗子达五万八千五百十九把。江南造纸厂职工的节约价值，也由七月份的三千五百余万元，提高到八月份的一亿一千余万元。华成烟厂工人创造了自动停车机，使卷烟纸的损失数字大大减少。中国工业热水瓶厂工人改进了烘缸，使每小时所烘的瓶胆由九十六只提高到二百十二只，同时，每天节省煤气十二度以上。

    芜湖火柴厂已使节约原料、减少浪费成为经常性的群众运动。该厂从去年十二月开展爱国劳动竞赛时起，就把节约原料、减低成本列为竞赛运动的主要内容；以后经过签订和修订爱国公约的群众运动，节约原料的工作就更加具体和充实起来。
    该厂在七月份检查时，在爱国公约中所规定的节约项目都完成了，有的并超过很多。切梗组达到了“刀头（弃料）不超过一寸”的规定，油灶组的双头火柴（废品）由每件（一千盒）零点九九斤，降低到零点三三斤。成绩最突出的是装盒组。爱国公约原定破盒率不超过二百四十分之一，该组的破盒率实际已降低到千分之一。七月以后，该厂各单位职工修订了爱国公约。他们又从改进与提高技术方面争取更大的节约成绩。切梗组切梗时留下的刀头原已缩短到不足一寸长，如再缩短，切刀便无法着力。工人陈宗文后来想出了办法，他有意把梗头留得更长些，再把切头夹杂在新的长片子中间去切，这样，刀头便被全部利用了。醮药组每盒药原来只能醮八车（每车三十排火柴梗）火柴。该组工人在研究后发现了一个道理，即醮药醮到末了时，由于醮药温度降低，体积收缩，耗药量便会随之增加。为减少药量消耗，他们就设法使醮药经常保持一定温度。结果，每盒药所醮的火柴便由八车提高到九车半到十车。其他生产单位也都有改进。如装盒组的破盒率又由千分之一降低到七千分之一。
    该厂节约原料的工作，对于推动各地减少目前木材和氯酸钾等重要原料方面的浪费，很有意义。该厂切梗、醮药、装盒和包封四个单位一年来节约的结果，就使全厂产品的制造成本降低百分之九左右。（新华社）
