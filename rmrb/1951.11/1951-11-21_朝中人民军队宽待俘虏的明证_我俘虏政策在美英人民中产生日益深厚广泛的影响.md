Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th: A reporter from this agency reports: The American, British, and other prisoners of war living in the prisoner of war camps of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as well as their families in their own countries, are authoritative witnesses to our army's consistent implementation of the revolutionary humanitarian prisoner of war policy. When reporters visited the prisoner of war camps, they gained a clear impression that, due to the convenience provided by our army for communication between prisoners and their families, the prisoner of war policy of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies is generating an increasingly deep and broad influence among the people of the United States and Britain.

American prisoner Nathaniel wrote about his personal feelings in a letter to his family on August 5th of this year. He wrote: "Since being captured, I have felt terrified. I thought the Chinese would treat prisoners as cruelly as the Japanese did. What surprised me was that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army took me to the rear, several miles from the front line, checked the items I had with me, and then returned them all to me. Later, the Chinese's many acts of kindness automatically changed my incorrect assumptions about them. I can say that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army treats prisoners of war very well and leniently." In another letter, he wrote: "We are receiving the best treatment here. The fresh term that correctly describes this is 'lenient policy.' This is true. I have been here for almost three months, and I have never heard of a prisoner being mistreated."

Another American prisoner, Sergeant Otis Cahn Thomas, wrote to his mother in Somerton, Arizona, in February of this year: "I know you and Dad must be worried about me because you must have heard that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are killing prisoners. Do not believe these words. They (referring to the Korean and Chinese troops) have been doing their best to take care of us and are concerned about our health." A prisoner named Arsen also wrote: "Do not lightly believe the rumors about prisoners of war. The Chinese told us that after the war is over, we will be sent home. I have no reason not to believe these words, because the facts prove that they are very honest people." Many other prisoners who were originally deceived by the American military authorities' propaganda also requested their relatives in their letters not to believe those rumors and everything they saw in the American newspapers.

Because many families of American, British, and other prisoners of war have already received letters from prisoners reporting that they are being treated leniently, the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing frequently broadcasts these letters abroad, and the American and British *Workers' Daily* newspapers publish detailed reports on the lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as well as the truth told by released prisoners, the situation of our army's lenient treatment of prisoners is spreading among the prisoners' families, relatives, friends, and neighbors, and they are expressing heartfelt gratitude to the Korean and Chinese people. American prisoner Edward L. Smith received a letter from his wife, Flora Smith, of San Diego, California, on February 17th of this year. The letter said: "I know from Xinhua News Agency's dispatches that you are safe and being treated leniently. I received a picture of you, and I cherish it. I have read the statement you signed, which said how well the Chinese People's Volunteer Army treats American prisoners. I recognize your handwriting. This statement and your picture have been published in the San Diego newspapers. The people here are all moved by the kindness of the kind Chinese people towards you and the prisoners with you. I am very grateful to them and hope that you will be released and come home to tell the American people about the kind treatment you received from the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always be friends of the American people." Another American prisoner, William, received a letter from his mother on Greenwood Avenue in Seattle, Washington, saying: "When we were notified that you were missing, our greatest hope was that you would safely become a prisoner of the Chinese. Because we are sure that anyone captured will be treated leniently. Letters from relatives and friends all have the same understanding. This trust is very common here."

Many families of prisoners of war from the United States, Britain, and other countries have specifically purchased new radios to listen to the prisoner recording broadcasts in the regular programs of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. One prisoner received a letter from his mother. It read: "Many people ran into the house to tell us that they had heard the news you broadcast. One child said that he could hear your voice clearly, as if you were in your hometown." Another British prisoner, Cecil Mackie, received a letter from his wife from Belfast, England. His wife said in the letter: "You surprised me on the morning of March 17th. What a wonderful surprise! I heard your voice. The lenient treatment of prisoners by the Chinese is being greatly praised in the newspapers here." She also wrote gratefully: "The reporter from the *Workers' Daily* has been keeping me in touch with you. They are so kind, sending many newspapers, broadcasts of the lenient treatment of prisoners, and the reassuring messages you sent me by radio."

Recently Captured American and British Soldiers
        Use Personal Experiences to Refute Hanley's Rumors

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: A reporter from this agency on the front lines reports: American and British soldiers recently captured in the battles on the Western Front are using the facts of their own lenient treatment to refute the malicious slanders of Hanley, the head of the Eighth Army's Military Law Department. Herbert Schweddy, a soldier in the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the United States, said: "It is infuriating that our officers like to conduct deceptive propaganda. Take the 'rotation system' for example. It is nominally stipulated that those who have completed six months can return home, but we had been in Korea for more than eight months before we were captured, and we still couldn't go home. This time, Hanley's words are also a deception. But our soldiers have long stopped believing in their tricks. Even though they are spreading rumors every day, saying that the Chinese and Korean troops are killing and mistreating prisoners, the soldiers in our troops learned the truth, which is contrary to their rumors, from the prisoners who were released by you and returned. Therefore, many soldiers in our troops secretly hide the 'safe conduct passes' distributed by the People's Army and the Volunteer Army in order to seek a way out on the battlefield. This time, after I was captured, I personally received the lenient treatment of the Volunteer Army: the Volunteer Army gave me cigarettes to smoke and issued me brand-new cotton clothes. All of this confirmed what those friends told us." A pilot, Seifert, said: "Our American Air Force bombs northern Korea every day, so our officers said that if an Air Force pilot is captured by the Communist Army, he will definitely be killed or mistreated by the Communist Army. But after I was captured, the Volunteer Army immediately treated my wounds and gave me a lot of care in my life. I already know very clearly: what our officers said is completely a lie." Ivan, a sergeant squad leader of the 4th Company of the Royal Scottish Borderers Regiment of the 28th Brigade of the British Commonwealth Division, said: "I had heard about the lenient prisoner of war policy of the Chinese and Korean troops a long time ago. But the officers deceived us, saying: that may not be entirely true. So when I was first captured, I was still a little scared. I took out my watch and pen and gave them to the Volunteer Army soldier who captured me; but he politely refused and said to me in English: 'Don't be afraid!' I was really moved. We are not only not killed or insulted here, but also receive grateful lenient treatment. But our officers are still spreading rumors there, saying that we have been killed. If Hanley is a Christian, I hope he repents to God and doesn't tell those lies against his conscience!"

American and British Prisoners of War Write Letters Back Home
        Reporting That They Are Living Safe and Happy Lives

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: The following are two American and British invading army prisoners of war who told their relatives and people in their own countries about the good treatment they received from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's lenient policy in the prisoner of war camp in Korea. British prisoner Cecil Mackie was originally a member of the 41st Commando of the British Royal Marines. He told his mother and brothers on Mouse Church Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland: "Don't worry about me. I am in good health, and I am now being well taken care of by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. You know that the food here is very different from the food at home, but the Chinese are doing their best to let us get food as close as possible to what we have at home. Our food is plentiful. We have pork, potatoes, and various vegetables to eat. We also make our own bread. We always have fruit to eat, regularly distributed sugar, and can also receive good tobacco leaves.

Every time the Chinese have a holiday, we always celebrate with them. They eat what we eat. This situation is hard to believe, but you can believe my words, it's true. They treat us more like friends than prisoners of war. It's hard to believe that we were fighting each other not long ago.

I think you have heard about the news of the Kaesong peace talks. People here are very concerned about the negotiations. We look for news about this in the newspapers every day, but I am very disappointed with the negotiations. I originally thought that the negotiations could be over by now, but it seems that there are still many twists and turns. The Chinese and Korean representatives are very sincere in the negotiations. They put forward various suggestions and adjustments to prevent the negotiations from breaking down, but the United Nations forces seem to be very stubborn. Another strange thing is that the vast majority of the representatives are Americans, and there is not even one Briton. You may think that Britain is one of the major countries in the United Nations, and it should at least have one representative. So far, every step towards peace has been taken by the Korean side."

Cecil Mackie said happily: "It looks like we will spend Christmas here. We all look forward to celebrating it greatly at that time. We will decorate the barracks and celebrate in our own way. We will perform our own plays, sing Christmas carols, and hold services. Many people think that the Communist Party opposes religion, but this is not true. They do not interfere with anyone's beliefs."

Gregory, a soldier of the 7th Company of the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the U.S. Army, said to his sisters and brothers in the United States: "I am very lucky to still be alive and to be able to tell you that I am in very good health. This is because the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army treat me very well and give me good medical treatment. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army do not regard prisoners as enemies, but as their friends. They try their best to treat prisoners and give us daily necessities such as soap, towels, tobacco leaves, sugar, clothes, toothbrushes, and toothpaste. We prisoners eat the same things as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

The war in Korea is an unjust war. We have seen American planes bomb and strafe cities and schools. These planes even bombed prisoner of war camps and killed American soldiers. That time, we were sent to this prisoner of war camp. Halfway there, in a small village in North Korea, we were strafed and bombed. Seven American soldiers died among us.

Now, Christmas is coming soon. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are going to give us prisoners a grand party. We prisoners are organizing our own programs to prepare for Christmas. We are preparing to perform dramas and entertainment, and sing Christmas carols. In short, there is everything for Christmas.

Sisters and brothers, don't worry about me. I am in good health and having a great time."

    朝中人民军队宽待俘虏的明证
    我俘虏政策在美英人民中产生日益深厚广泛的影响
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】本社记者报道：生活在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军俘虏营中的美、英等国俘虏及他们在自己国家中的家属，是我军始终不渝地实行革命人道主义的俘虏政策的权威见证人。当记者访问俘虏营时获得一个鲜明的印象，这就是由于我军给予俘虏及其家属之间以通讯的便利，朝、中人民军队的俘虏政策，正在美、英等国的人民群众中产生日益深厚与广泛的影响。
    美国俘虏纳赛尼尔在今年八月五日给家人的信中写出了自己的亲身实感。他写道：“自从一被俘，我就感到恐怖，我想中国人会像日本人一样地虐待俘虏。接着使我惊奇的是中国志愿军带我到离战线几英里的后方，检查我身上带的物品，然而又全部还给了我。以后中国人许多次的和善行为使我自动改变了对他们不正确的推测。我可以说，中国志愿军对待俘虏是真正良好的和宽大的。”他在另一封信上又写道：“我们在这里得到最好的待遇，这个被正确地介绍给我们的新鲜称呼是‘宽大政策’。这是事实，我留在这里差不多有三个月了，从没有听到有一个俘虏受到虐待。”
    另一个美国俘虏中士奥铁斯·坎·汤马斯在今年二月间写信给他在亚利桑那州桑末尔顿的母亲说：“我知道你跟爸爸一定要为我担心，因为你一定听说朝鲜人民军与中国志愿军要把俘虏杀掉。不要相信这些话，他们（指朝中部队）已经尽他们的力量来照顾我们，并且关怀我们的健康。”一个名叫阿森的俘虏也这样写道：“不要轻信关于战俘的谣言。中国人告诉我们：待战争结束后，我们将被遣送回家。我没有理由不相信这些话，因为事实证明他们是很诚实的人。”还有许多原来受了美军当局欺骗宣传的俘虏们，都在信上要求自己的亲属们不要相信那些谣传和在美国报纸上所看到的一切。
    由于很多美、英等国俘虏的家属们已经收到俘虏报告受到宽待的信件，北京中央人民广播电台经常向外广播这些信件，美国和英国的工人日报刊载朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军宽待俘虏情况的详尽报道，以及释放回去的俘虏说出了实情，俘虏家属及其亲友邻居中相互传播着我军宽待俘虏的情况，并对朝中人民表示衷心的感激。美国俘虏爱德华·莱·史密斯接到来自加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥的他的妻子弗洛拉·史密斯于今年二月十七日写的信。这封信上说：“我从新华社的电讯中知道你平安与受到宽待。我接到你的一张像片，我珍视它。我读过你曾签字的声明，上面说中国人民志愿军对待美国俘虏是如何好。我认识你的字迹。这个声明和你的像片已经在圣地亚哥的报纸上发表了。这里的人民都为好心的中国人民所给予你和你在一起的俘虏们的仁慈行为而感动。我非常感谢他们，希望你被释放后回家来，把你从中国人民那里所受到的仁慈的待遇告诉美国人民。中国人民永远是美国人民的朋友。”另一个美国俘虏威廉接到他母亲从华盛顿州西雅图格林伍德大街寄来的信中说：“得到通知说你已失踪时，我们最大的希望就是你平安地做了中国人的俘虏。因为我们确信，任何人被俘一定会得到宽待的。亲属和朋友们的来信中都有同样的认识。这种信任在这里是非常普遍的。”
    许多美、英等国的俘虏家属特地购买了新式的收音机，收听北京中央人民广播电台经常节目中的俘虏录音广播。有一个俘虏收到他母亲给他的信。上面写着：“有许多人跑进屋来，告诉我们曾听到你广播过的消息。一个孩子说，他清楚地听到你的声音，好像你就在家乡。”另一个英国俘虏赛西尔·马其收到他妻子从英国培尔法斯特寄来的一封信。他的妻子在信上说：“三月十七日的早上，你使我吃了一惊，这是何等美妙的一惊啊！我听到你说话的声音。中国人宽待俘虏，这正在这里的报纸上大大地受到赞扬。”她又感激地写道：“工人日报的记者一直使我与你们保持接触。他们太好了，送来很多报纸、俘虏们受宽待的广播和你由无线电给我的平安家信。”
    最近被俘的美英军士兵
        用亲身经历斥汉莱造谣 【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】本社前线记者报道：最近在西线作战中被俘的美军和英军士兵，都用他们亲身受到宽大待遇的事实，来驳斥美军第八军军法处处长汉莱的恶意诽谤。美国骑兵第一师第七团第一营第三连的士兵赫伯特·施维蒂说：“我们长官们喜欢进行欺骗宣传，是一件令人气愤的事。拿‘轮换制’来说，在名义上规定期满六个月者可以回国，可是我们被俘前，在朝鲜已有八个多月了，还不能回家。这次汉莱说的话也同样是个欺骗。不过我们士兵们早已不相信他们这一套了。尽管他们天天在那儿造谣，说中国军队和朝鲜军队杀害和虐待俘虏，但是我们部队里的士兵，从被你们释放回去的俘虏的口中，知道了和他们的造谣相反的真情。所以我们部队里许多士兵，都暗藏着人民军和志愿军散发的‘安全证’，以备在战场上寻求生路。这次我被俘后，亲身受到志愿军的宽待：志愿军给我烟吸，并发给我崭新的棉衣。这一切都证实了那些朋友们告诉我们的话。”一个空军驾驶员西佛冷说：“我们美国空军因天天到朝鲜北部轰炸，所以我们的长官说空军驾驶员如果被共军俘掳去，那一定会受到共军的杀害或虐待的。可是我被俘后，志愿军马上给我医治伤口，生活上也给我很多照顾。我已很清楚地知道：我们的长官说的话，完全是谎话。”英国联邦师第二十八旅皇家苏格兰边防团第四连中士班长伊万说：“中朝军队的宽待俘虏政策，我早就听说的。但长官都欺骗我们说：那不一定完全是事实。所以我在刚被俘时，还有些害怕，我就把我的手表、钢笔拿出来，送给俘掳我的那个志愿军战士；但他很客气地拒绝了，并且用英语对我说：‘不要怕！’我真感动极了。我们在这里不但没有受到杀害和侮辱，而且还受到了令人感激的宽待。但我们的长官们还在那里造谣，说我们受到杀害了。汉莱如果是个基督的信徒，愿他向上帝悔过，不要讲那些昧着良心的谎话吧！”
    美英俘虏写信寄回本国
        报告他们生活平安愉快
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】下面是两个美、英侵略军俘虏，向其国内的亲人与人民讲述他们在朝鲜俘虏营中受到中国人民志愿军宽大政策的良好待遇的情况。英国俘虏赛西尔·麦其原来是英国皇家海军陆战队第四十一突击队队员。他告诉他在北爱尔兰培尔法斯特茅舍教堂路的母亲和兄弟说： “不要为我担忧，我的身体很好，我现在受到中国志愿军很好的照顾。你们知道这里的伙食和家里的伙食很不一样，但是中国人是在尽力让我们得到和我们家里的尽可能相近的伙食。我们的食物很充分，我们有猪肉、马铃薯和各种蔬菜吃，我们还自己做面包。我们一直有水果吃，有经常配给的糖，还能领到很好的烟叶。
    每当中国人过节日时，我们总是和他们一道庆祝。他们吃什么，我们也吃什么。这种情形很难使人相信，但是你们可以相信我的话，是真的，与其说他们把我们当做战俘看待，还不如说他们把我们当做朋友看待。这种情况使人很难相信前不久我们彼此还在交战。
    我想你们已听到开城和平谈判的消息。我们这里的人对谈判都很关心，我们天天从报纸上找这方面的消息看，但是我对谈判非常失望。我原来以为谈判到现在可以结束了，但是看来似乎还有许多波折。中朝代表对谈判很有诚意，他们提出各种建议和调整，使谈判不致破裂，但是联合国军方面似乎非常固执。另外一件奇怪的事情是绝大多数代表是美国人，连一个英国人也没有。你们也许认为英国是联合国中的大国之一，它至少应当有一个代表。到现在为止，每一个走向和平的步骤都是朝鲜方面采取的。”
    赛西尔·麦其愉快地说：“看样子我们将在这里过圣诞节。我们大家都盼望到那时大大庆祝一番。我们将把营房装饰起来，按照我们自己的方式来庆祝，我们将要自己演戏，唱圣诞歌曲，还要做礼拜。许多人以为共产党反对宗教，但是这是不合事实的，他们不过问任何人的信仰。”
    美军第三师第七团第七连士兵格利高里对美国的姊妹兄弟们说：“我很幸运，仍然活在人间，而且能够告诉你们，我的身体非常健康。这是因为中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军很优待我，并且给我很好的医疗。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军不把俘虏看成敌人，而把俘虏看成他们的朋友。他们想尽办法给俘虏治病，还给我们肥皂、手巾、烟叶、糖、衣服、牙刷、牙膏这一类日用必需品。我们这些俘虏吃的东西和中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军一样。
    在朝鲜进行的战争是一场不正义的战争。我们曾经看见美国飞机轰炸和扫射城市和学校。这些飞机甚至轰炸俘虏营，炸死美国兵。那一次，我们被送到现在这个俘虏营来，走到半路上，在北朝鲜的一个小村子里，受到了扫射和轰炸。我们之间死了七个美国兵。
    现在，圣诞节快要来了。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军要给我们俘虏开一个盛大的晚会。我们这些俘虏正在组织我们自己的节目，准备庆祝圣诞节。我们准备演出戏剧和游艺，唱圣诞歌曲。总之，圣诞节的名堂应有尽有。
    姊妹兄弟们，你们别替我担心。我身体很好，而且过得挺起劲。”
