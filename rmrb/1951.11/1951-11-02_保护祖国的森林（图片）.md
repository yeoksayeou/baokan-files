　　Protecting the Motherland's Forests
    Liu Jiyou
    (8) During periods when fires are likely to occur, Wang Qingheng organized all the women in the village to stand guard and inspect people entering the mountains. Conspicuous fire prevention signs are erected along the main roads through the forest area, reminding everyone to pay attention to fire prevention.
    (9) Wang Qingheng inspects the forest area every seven days. His clothes are worn out, and his shoes are full of holes, but he never complains. In the cold forest, he never lights a fire when camping out. Regardless of hunger and cold, he patrols the deep mountains day and night.
    (10) After each inspection, Wang Qingheng always reports the inspection situation to the Forestry Bureau or the district government.

    （八）在容易发生火灾期间，王清恒组织了全村妇女放哨，检查入山行人。在通过林区的要道旁，设立着触目的防火标示牌，让人人注意防火。
    （九）王清恒每七天入林区检查一次，衣服磨破了，鞋子穿通了，从来没抱怨过。他在寒冷的森林里，打小宿（露宿）也不点火，他不顾饥饿和寒冷，昼夜在深山里巡视。
    （十）王清恒每次检查后，总要向林务局或区政府报告检查情况。
