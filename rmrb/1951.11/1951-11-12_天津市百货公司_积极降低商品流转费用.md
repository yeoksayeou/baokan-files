　　Tianjin Department Store
    Actively Reduces Commodity Circulation Costs
    In response to the superior's call to reduce commodity circulation costs by 4.06 percent, the Tianjin Department Store began a competition to reduce commodity circulation costs on October 5. As of the end of October, the company's commodity circulation costs had been reduced to 3.55 percent of commodity turnover.

    During the competition, employees in various departments paid close attention to improving working methods. The transportation department had a dedicated person at the freight station to handle unloading and other procedures; the use of bill exchange and on-site distribution methods reduced many procedures. The transfer of only forty truckloads of goods saved handling, warehousing, and other expenses totaling more than 67,000 catties of millet. In terms of warehouse management, the connection between incoming and outgoing goods was strengthened. For example, when the warehouse received a notice from the port authority to pick up 10,000 bags of soda ash, it contacted the sales department, and more than 5,000 bags were directly allocated to the buyer from the station, saving manpower and warehouse rent. The unloading and handling fees alone saved more than 90 million yuan. Warehouse management personnel also carefully inspected the quality of purchased goods, and unqualified goods were immediately returned, reducing losses. In terms of sales, the packaging paper used to be four-cut, but now it is changed to six-cut, saving more than four million yuan in twenty days.

　　天津市百货公司
    积极降低商品流转费用
    天津市百货公司响应上级减低商品流转费百分之四点零六的号召，于十月五日开始进行减低商品流转费竞赛，截至十月底，该公司商品流转费已降低到商品流转额的百分之三点五五。
    在竞赛过程中，各部门职工十分注意改进工作方法。运输部门在货物运送站设有专人，办理卸车等手续；利用换单转运、就地分拨的办法，减少了许多手续。仅转运四十车货物，就节省了搬运、栈租等费用合六万七千余斤小米。在仓库保管方面，加强了进货销货的联系。如仓库接到港务局提取碱面一万包的通知，即与销货部门联系，由车站直接拨付买主五千余包，节省了人力和栈租，仅卸车搬运费一项，就节省了九千余万元。仓库保管人员也认真检查买进货物的质量，不合规格的就立即退回，减少了损失。销货方面，过去包装纸是用四裁的，现改为六裁，二十天中节省了四百余万元。
