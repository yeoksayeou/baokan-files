	Economic Briefs
	▲ Farmers in various provinces of the Central South region are enthusiastically paying patriotic public grain. The collection of public grain in Hubei Province and Jiangxi Province has been basically completed, and Hunan Province is nearing completion. Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces started collecting later, and farmers in the two provinces are now actively paying grain.
	▲ The sowing of wheat in the major wheat-producing areas of East China, Shandong Province, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui, has long been completed, and the wheat fields are already lush green. The wheat planting area in Shandong Province reaches approximately 48 million mu, an increase of 9 percent compared to last year; the wheat planting area in Northern Jiangsu increased by 23 percent compared to last year; the wheat planting area in Northern Anhui accounts for about 70 percent of the total cultivated area in the region.
	▲ State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in cotton-producing areas such as Shanzhou and Lingbao in Henan Province have corrected the tendency of emphasizing procurement while neglecting supply, and strengthened the work of supplying materials, resulting in a rapid increase in the amount of new cotton purchased. The amount of cotton purchased in October exceeded the plan by 50 percent. Although the cotton purchase plan for November has been greatly increased, the amount of new cotton purchased in the first ten days still exceeded the planned figure.
