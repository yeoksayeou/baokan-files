　　Hebei Shulu County Cooperative:
    Cadres Disregard Cotton Storage Work
    Over 10,000 Jin of Cotton Deteriorates Due to Rain
    Editor: After new cotton came on the market, the Shulu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and its affiliated district cooperatives in Hebei Province were entrusted by the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to make purchases on its behalf. However, due to the failure of the county's supply and marketing cooperative and its affiliated cooperatives' cadres to pay attention to cotton storage, and due to poor storage facilities, the purchased cotton suffered losses. In mid-October, the county had two days of rain. In more than ten district and village supply and marketing cooperatives, including Old City, Wuwang Village, Nanpang, and Dulin, many cotton bales were soaked by rain due to leaky warehouses or the failure to cover cotton stored in the open. In low-lying areas, the cotton was even submerged in mud. For example, the Wuwang Village Cooperative left six tied cotton bales in the yard without covering them, and they were rained on for a day and two nights. The county cooperative's processing factory stored approximately 30,000 jin of unginned cotton in the open. After this cotton was rained on and not restacked in time, it was recently discovered during inspection that over 1,000 jin of cotton inside the pile had deteriorated and sprouted. According to statistics, the county supply and marketing cooperative and its affiliated cooperatives lost approximately 11,000 jin of cotton due to improper storage. The masses are very dissatisfied with this, and they reflected: When things (referring to cotton) get to the public sector, and the quantity is large, they don't think it matters if a little bit is ruined! I believe that this loss is entirely due to the failure of cooperative cadres to cherish the people's property and their lack of political responsibility. I suggest that relevant departments conduct a detailed inspection of the Shulu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and its affiliated cooperatives, and based on the specific circumstances, give the negligent personnel responsible for storing the cotton criticism or punishment.

### 河北束鹿县合作社  干部不重视棉花保管工作  万余斤棉花因受雨淋变质

　　河北束鹿县合作社
    干部不重视棉花保管工作
    万余斤棉花因受雨淋变质
    编辑同志：河北束鹿县供销社及所属各区社，在新花上市后，即接受国营花纱布公司的委托进行代购。但由于该县供销社及所属各社干部不重视棉花保管工作，存储设备不好，因而使收购的棉花受到损失。十月中旬该县下了两天雨，旧城、吴王村、南庞、杜林等十余区、村供销社多因库房漏雨或对露天存储的棉花不加遮盖，使不少棉花被雨水淋湿，在地点低洼的地方，棉花甚至被泡在泥水中。例如：吴王村社，将扎成的棉花包六个放在院内不加遮盖，被雨淋了一天两夜；该县县社有一加工工厂露天存储籽棉约三万斤，这些籽棉被雨淋过以后又未及时倒垛，最近检查时，发现该垛内已有千余斤棉花变质发芽。据统计该县供销社及所属各社，因保管不善而使棉花变质的，约有一万一千多斤。群众对此很不满意，他们反映说：东西（指棉花）到了公家，数量多了，坏一点半点的他们认为不算什么！我认为这一损失，完全是由于合作社干部不爱护人民财产，缺乏政治责任心所造成的。我建议有关部门对束鹿县供销社及所属各社进行详细检查，并根据具体情况，给负责保管棉花的失职人员以批评或处分。李恩普
