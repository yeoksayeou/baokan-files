　　Guarding the Kaesong Frontline
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yan Wu
    The recent Korean armistice negotiations are being conducted under the threat of war. Shells from the US-ROK army positions on the east bank of the Sajawon River frequently pass over the neutral zone of Panmunjom, and the sound of machine gun fire is heard intermittently. Our army, guarding the west bank of the Sajawon River, bears the glorious task of protecting the negotiation venue.
    Our volunteer army commanders and soldiers guarding the west bank of the Sajawon River have shown great restraint towards the military provocations from the opposite bank. The soldiers said: "We hope that the armistice negotiations will be successful, and we will never fire the first shot." However, the enemy mistook our army's restraint for weakness. Starting from October 27th, under the cover of artillery and tanks, they launched more than ten attacks on our positions along the Gunjangsan, Cheondeoksan, Deokmulsan, and Namchon-dong lines southwest of Panmunjom. The warriors guarding the positions were enraged, and a high-spirited mood of "annihilating the invaders" was boiling everywhere. When the enemy approached our army's position, Communist Party member Liu Jinling leaned out of the dust-filled fortifications and shouted: "Panmunjom is beside us, and Kaesong is behind us. Li Qigwei wants Kaesong at the negotiating table, and here he reaches out to take Kaesong. Comrades, we must break the enemy's bloody claws!" The soldiers jumped out of the trenches and charged towards the enemy with the force of a storm, engaging in a life-and-death struggle. Company Commander Bian Yuqing's cotton uniform was riddled with enemy bullets, but he still led the soldiers in the charge, finally driving the enemy back to the east bank of the Sajawon River.
    Our peaceful warriors resolutely support the plan to determine the existing line of actual contact as the military demarcation line. They said: "It would have been very reasonable to stop the war at the 38th parallel. In order to eliminate all the excuses of the US side, we have also proposed a plan to stop the war according to the actual line of contact. Now the enemy is unreasonably trying to seize Kaesong, and we will absolutely not agree!" Everyone on the position knows: defending the Kaesong area and giving the warmongers a severe punishment is of great significance to the cause of world peace. The warriors wrote in their resolution: "In order to defend Kaesong and protect the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations, we would rather lose our heads and shed our blood than allow the enemy to invade Kaesong."
    The soldiers are on high alert, sharpening their knives and cleaning their guns, ready to crush any possible enemy attack. The political commissar of the unit went to inspect a position. The warriors guarding this position had already repelled multiple attacks by enemies several times their number. The political commissar asked the warriors: "You have already repelled the attacks of two enemy companies. What if the enemy sends two more companies?" The warriors replied: "We are fully confident of defeating them!" The political commissar asked again: "The enemy sent two companies, and then sends two more companies?" The soldiers all laughed and said: "Welcome Li Qigwei to send more gifts!"

　　守卫在开城前线
    新华社记者　阎吾
    最近的朝鲜停战谈判会议是在战火威胁下进行着的。来自砂川河东岸美李军阵地的炮弹不时从板门店中立区边缘的上空穿过，机关枪的射击声时密时疏，守卫在砂川河西岸的我军担负着保护谈判会场的光荣任务。
    对于来自对岸的军事挑衅，在砂川河西岸守卫的志愿军的指挥员战斗员们曾表现了高度的忍耐。战士们说：“我们是希望停战谈判能够成功的，我们决不先打第一枪。”但是，敌人竟把我军这种忍耐误认为可欺，他们从十月二十七日起，以大炮、战车掩护着步兵连日向我板门店西南军藏山、天德山、德物山、南村洞一线阵地发起攻击，先后共达十多次。守在阵地上的勇士们被激怒了，到处沸腾着“歼灭进犯者”的昂扬情绪。当敌人攻近我军阵地的时候，共产党员刘金陵从尘烟弥漫的工事里探身出来高声喊道：“我们的身边是板门店，背后就是开城。李奇微在会议桌上要开城，在这里就伸手来要开城，同志们，我们一定要把敌人的血爪打断！”战士们跳出交通壕，以狂风暴雨之势直冲敌群，同敌人进行你死我活的拚杀。连长边玉清的棉衣上被敌人的子弹穿了许多的洞，仍然带领战士冲击过去，终于把敌人又赶回砂川河东岸。
    我们的和平勇士们坚决拥护确定现有实际接触线为军事分界线的方案。他们说：“本来在三八线上停战是很合理的。为了杜绝美方的一切藉口，我们又提出了按实际接触线停战的方案。现在敌人又要无理强占开城，我们是绝对不答应的！”阵地上的每个人都知道：守卫开城区，给好战者以严厉的惩罚，对于人类和平事业有多么重大的意义。勇士们在自己的决心书上这样写着：“为了守卫开城，保护停战谈判能顺利进行，我们头可断，血可流，决不让敌人侵占开城。”
    严阵以待的战士们磨刀擦枪，随时准备粉碎敌人的可能的进攻。该部政治委员曾到一个阵地上去巡视。守在这个阵地上的勇士们已经打退过数倍于己的敌人的多次进攻。政治委员问勇士们：“你们已经打退了两个连敌人的进攻，如果敌人再来两个连呢？”勇士们回答说：“完全有把握打垮它！”政治委员又问：“敌人来了两个连，再来两个连呢？”战士们都哈哈大笑起来说：“欢迎李奇微多多来送礼！”
