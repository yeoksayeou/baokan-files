Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: TASS Moscow: From early morning on November 7th, the streets of Moscow were filled with parade groups. The wide streets were decorated for the festive occasion, and the marchers proceeded along the streets toward the city center – Red Square.

At exactly 11 a.m., the holiday parade of the working people of the Soviet capital began. At the head of the procession were well-known workers, scientists, and cultural figures from the capital. The famous railway innovator, locomotive driver, and Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Blazhenov, held high the flag of the Moscow City Soviet.

The Soviet athletes' contingent numbered ten thousand, all cheerful and lively young men and women. They held aloft a huge portrait of J.V. Stalin, surrounded by sixteen flags with the national emblems of each of the constituent republics. A huge banner held aloft above the contingent read: "Glory to the Great Stalin!" Another long streamer read: "The Thirty-Fourth October." The athletes, both men and women, held flowers and waved them enthusiastically to the leaders of the Party and government on the mausoleum reviewing stand.

The working people of the capital marched across the square in twelve columns. They held high red flags and thousands upon thousands of huge portraits – portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the founders of the Soviet state, and of the leaders of the Party and the Soviet government. There were also many slogans, charts, and posters reflecting the great victories of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people's desire for peace, and their desire to live in friendship with the people of all countries. Large red banners carried the Bolshevik Party's holiday slogans, which hailed the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – the bastion of friendship and glory of the Soviet peoples – the indestructible bastion of world peace.

The citizens of Moscow expressed their boundless love and loyalty to the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government.

Long live the great Communist Party, the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the experienced vanguard of the Soviet people, the inspirer and organizer of our victories! These words were written on thousands of placards.

The following thought, which is uppermost in the minds of the Soviet people, could be seen everywhere: "We defend peace." The working people of the Kirov District of Moscow carried a beautiful poster to Red Square, depicting the Soviet people signing the declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact for Peace. Soviet men and women have unanimously supported the World Peace Council's declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact for Peace. Nearly 100 million Soviet citizens have already signed this declaration. Today, during the holiday demonstration in Moscow, the Soviet people once again declared: "We must persist in the great cause of peace." They extended fraternal greetings to all peoples who are fighting against aggressors and instigators of another war, and for peace, democracy, and socialism. The Soviet people warmly support the foreign policy of their government – a policy that advocates peace, security, equality, and friendship among all nations.

The working people of the Moscow City Soviet District held up placards with the full text of the "Law on the Defense of Peace" passed by the Soviet government. Demonstrators also held up declarations by V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin regarding the peaceful policy of the Soviet government. The working people of the October District, amid thousands of placards and banners, held high above the ranks a poster containing one of the earliest decrees passed by the young Soviet Republic in 1917 – Lenin's Decree on Peace. This historic document demonstrates the Soviet state's adherence to a policy of peace.

The Soviet people, celebrating their great holiday – the thirty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the socialist state – extend warm greetings to their foreign friends. They wish success to the great Chinese people, who are consolidating the people's democratic system in their country.

The images of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the Government Administration Council of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, were held high in the parade.

The people of Moscow hailed the working people of the people's democratic countries, who are victoriously building socialism. They held up the images of Bolesław Bierut, President of the Republic of Poland, and Józef Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Klement Gottwald, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, and Antonín Zápotocký, Prime Minister; Valko Chervenkov, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; Georgi Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of Bulgaria; Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party; István Dobi, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic; Sándor Rónai, Chairman of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic; Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; Petru Groza, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic; Constantin Parhon, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly; Enver Hoxha, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour; Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania; Marshal Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, and others.

The Soviet people paid tribute to the democratic forces of Germany who are fighting for a united, independent, democratic and peace-loving Germany. The demonstrators marched forward holding portraits of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister, and Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

The people of Moscow extended heartfelt and warm respect to the brave Korean people who are heroically fighting against foreign aggressors and for the freedom and independence of their motherland. They carried portraits of Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They also carried a portrait of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The parade prominently featured portraits of heroic fighters from various countries who are struggling for peace and the happiness of working people: Maurice Thorez, the leader of the French people, Palmiro Togliatti, the leader of the Italian people, William Z. Foster, the leader of the American revolutionary working class, Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain, and Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

The column flowed into Red Square like an endless tide. Participating in the parade were scientists, artists, workers, employees, and students - including people from all walks of life. The charts and models in the procession vividly reflected the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in peaceful construction, and the entire content of the Soviet state's life today.

Along with all the Soviet people, Muscovites participated in the great communist construction projects - the construction of huge hydroelectric power stations and canals. They are working hard to complete this year's state plan as soon as possible, and to strive for further development of the Soviet Union's advanced science and culture. Two hundred factories in Moscow are smoothly fulfilling orders for the great communist construction projects, supplying automobiles, cranes, engines, transformers, construction machinery, and other equipment. The complete set of unprecedented machines required for the Volga-Don Canal has been completed by the staff of the Dynamo factory. Today, they reported: "Orders for the Volga-Don Canal have been completed ahead of schedule." The Capital Transformer Factory and many other enterprises have achieved the same results. Famous Soviet scientists, who have solved hundreds of major problems for the construction of the new hydroelectric power station, participated in the parade in the ranks of the Lenin district. The longest canal in the world, new lush fields and orchards, and huge hydroelectric power stations – all of this is no longer a dream, but a tangible reality, and people are working hard to realize these ideals. This is why the great communist construction projects occupied such a prominent place in the charts, models, and banners in the parade.

Many of these were reports of achievements by Moscow industrial workers. Looking at the ranks of the staff of the Red Proletarian Machine Tool Factory, one knew that the factory had begun manufacturing thirteen new types of machine tools this year. The factory is also known for its widespread use of high-speed metal cutting. The staff of the Three Hills Textile Factory produced nearly two million meters of textiles above the plan. The working people of Moscow's Bauman District completed their ten-month production plan on October 10. At the forefront of the Belvomaisky District's ranks were workers from the Hammer and Sickle Steel Plant. To celebrate the holiday, they produced thousands of tons of high-quality steel above the plan for the great communist construction projects. The workers held up portraits of the best steelmakers and steel rollers. Workers from many other enterprises gave their workshop partners the same honor.

Moscow construction workers, who are implementing Stalin's overall plan to rebuild the capital, held up tall models of buildings, new apartments, schools, and cinemas. This year, seven hundred new large apartments are being built in Moscow, and new buildings are emerging.

The music of the band echoed continuously on Red Square, and people cheered the names of Stalin, the great leader of working mankind, the Communist Party, and the leaders of the Soviet government. The citizens of Moscow warmly cheered and paid tribute to the many foreign guests in the stands.

The last to march in the parade were young athletes, holding high a large red flag with portraits of J.V. Stalin and members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

The parade lasted three and a half hours and was attended by nearly one million people. This is a vivid proof of the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, which proves that the Soviet people are closely united around the Bolshevik Party, around the Soviet government, and around the leader and teacher J.V. Stalin.

    庆祝十月社会主义革命三十四周年
    莫斯科近百万人参加节日游行
    显示苏联人民保卫世界和平和建设共产主义的决心
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一月七日大清早起，莫斯科的街道上就挤满了游行的队伍。宽阔的大街装饰得一片节日气象，游行者的队伍沿着一条条的大街向市中心——红场——进发。
    上午十一时正，苏联首都劳动人民的节日游行开始了。行列的最前面是首都的知名的男女工人、科学家、文化工作者。著名的铁路革新者、机车司机、苏联最高苏维埃代表布拉森诺夫高举着莫斯科市苏维埃的旗帜。
    苏联运动员的队伍有一万人，都是些愉快活泼的男女青年。他们高举着约·维·斯大林的巨幅画像，像的周围饰有十六面旗帜，旗上有各加盟共和国的国徽。高举在队伍上面的一幅巨大的横旗上面写着：“光荣归于伟大的斯大林！”另外一幅长幡上写着：“第三十四个十月。”男女运动员们手里都持有鲜花，在走过陵墓检阅台时就挥舞着鲜花，热烈地向党与政府的领袖们欢呼。
    首都的劳动人民以十二列纵队行过广场。他们高举着红旗和成千成万的巨幅画像——苏维埃国家的创立者列宁与斯大林，党与苏联政府的领袖的画像。另外还有许多标语、图表与板画，反映了苏联的伟大胜利、苏联人民的和平愿望以及他们要与其他一切国家的人民友好共处的愿望。大红色的横旗上写着布尔什维克党的节日口号，这些口号欢呼伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——苏联各族人民友好与光荣的堡垒——世界和平的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    莫斯科市民表示他们对布尔什维克党与苏联政府无限的热爱与忠诚。
    伟大的共产党、列宁和斯大林的党、苏联人民的饶有斗争经验的先锋队、我们的胜利的鼓舞者和组织者万岁！数千的标语牌上，都写着这些字。
    四面八方都可以看见萦回于苏联人民心中的这句话：“我们保卫和平。”莫斯科市基洛夫区的劳动人民把一幅美丽的板画抬到红场上来，板画上画着苏联人民在要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言上签名的情形。苏联男女已经万众一心地支持世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言。将近一亿的苏联公民已经在这个宣言上签了名。今天，在莫斯科举行节日的示威中，苏联人民再一次表明：“我们要坚持伟大的和平事业。”他们向一切为反对侵略者和再一次战争的煽动者，以及为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的人民，致以兄弟般的敬意。苏联人民热烈地拥护他们政府的外交政策——主张各国间和平、安全、平等、友好的政策。
    莫斯科市苏维埃区的劳动人民高举着标语牌，上面写着苏联政府所通过的“保卫和平法案”的全文。示威者还举着写有乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林关于苏联政府和平政策的宣言。十月区劳动人民在数千个标语牌和标语旗的中间，高高地举在行列上面的，是一幅板画，上面抄录了一九一七年年青的苏维埃共和国所通过的最早的命令之一——列宁关于和平的命令。这一个具有历史意义的文件，表明苏维埃国家坚持爱好和平的政策。
    苏联人民在庆祝自己的伟大节日——社会主义国家立国三十四周年纪念——的时候，向他们的外国朋友们致热烈的敬礼。他们预祝正在国内巩固人民民主制度的伟大的中国人民获得成功。
    游行者的队伍中高举中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东、中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来、中国共产党中央委员会书记刘少奇和中华人民共和国中央人民政府副主席朱德的画像。
    莫斯科人民向正在胜利地建设着社会主义的人民民主国家的劳动人民欢呼。他们高举着波兰共和国总统贝鲁特和部长会议主席西伦凯维兹、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统哥特瓦尔德和总理萨波托斯基、保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记契尔文科夫、保加利亚国民议会主席团主席达米扬诺夫、匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西、匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席道比、匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席罗奈伊、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治、罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席格罗查、国民议会主席团主席巴洪、阿尔巴尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记霍查、阿尔巴尼亚国民议会主席团主席尼沙尼、蒙古人民共和国总理乔巴山元帅等的画像。
    苏联人民向正在为统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国而奋斗的德国民主势力致敬。示威者的队伍高举着德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥和德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记乌布利希的画像前进。
    莫斯科人民对正在为反对外国侵略者、争取祖国自由独立而进行英雄斗争的勇敢的朝鲜人民，致以衷心的热烈敬意。他们抬着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民议会常任委员会委员长金枓奉的画像。他们也抬着越南民主共和国主席胡志明的画像。
    游行队伍中高高举着各国为和平及劳动人民幸福而斗争的英勇战士的画像：法国人民领袖多列士，意大利人民领袖托里亚蒂，美国革命工人阶级的领袖福斯特，西班牙共产党中央委员会总书记伊巴露丽，英国共产党总书记波立特。
    队伍像无穷尽的潮流一样涌入红场。参加游行的有科学家、艺术家、工人、职员和学生——包括了各界人民。队伍当中的图表模型，生动地反映了苏联人民在和平建设劳动中的辉煌成就，反映了苏维埃国家今日生活的全部内容。
    和全体苏联人民一道，莫斯科人参加了伟大的共产主义建设工程——巨大的水力发电站和运河的建设，他们正在努力工作，以求早日完成今年的国家计划，争取更进一步发展苏联先进的科学和文化。莫斯科两百家工厂正在顺利地履行伟大的共产主义建设工程的定货合同，供给了汽车、起重机、发动机、变压器、建筑机器和其他装备。伏尔加河—顿河运河所需的全套空前的机器，已由狄纳莫工厂的人员完成了，今天。他们报告说：“伏尔加河—顿河运河的定货已经提前完成。”首都变压器厂和其他许多企业也取得了同样的成绩。曾经为新水力发电站的建筑解决了数百个重大问题的苏联名科学家，在列宁区的队伍里参加了游行。世界上最长的运河，新的茂盛的田野和果园，巨大的水力发电站——这一切都不再是梦想，而是捉摸得到的现实的了，人民正在为这些理想的实现而努力。就是因为这样，所以伟大的共产主义建设工程才在游行队伍的图表模型及旗帜等等东西里占了如此醒目的位置。
    其中有许多是莫斯科工业工人所报告的成就。看一下红色无产阶级工作母机工厂的人员的队伍，人们就知道该厂在今年已开始制造十三种新型工作母机。这个工厂还以广泛应用金属高速切削法著称。三山纺织厂的人员超计划生产出了近二百万公尺的纺织品。莫斯科包曼区的劳动人民在十月十日完成了十个月的生产计划。贝尔伏马依斯基区的队伍的最前列是镰刀和锤子钢铁厂的工人。为了庆祝这个节日，他们超计划为伟大的共产主义建设工程生产了数千吨质量很高的钢。工人们高举着最优秀的炼钢工人与辗钢工人的画像。其他许多企业的工人也给了他们的车间伙伴同样的荣誉。
    正在执行重建首都的斯大林总计划的莫斯科建筑工人高举着高大的楼房、新的公寓、学校与电影院的模型。今年，在莫斯科有七百座新的大公寓正在建筑起来，新的建筑物正在出现。
    红场上不断地回响着乐队的演奏声，人们都欢呼着劳动人类伟大的领袖斯大林、共产党和苏联政府的领袖的名字。莫斯科市民热情地向看台上的许多外宾欢呼致敬。
    在游行队伍最后行进的是青年运动员，他们高举着大红色的旗帜，上面绘有约·维·斯大林与苏联共产党（布）中央委员会政治局委员的肖像。
    游行历时三个半小时，参加者近一百万人。这是苏联人民精神上与政治上团结一致的生动明证，它证明了苏联人民紧紧地团结在布尔什维克党的周围、团结在苏联政府的周围、团结在领袖与导师约·维·斯大林的周围。
