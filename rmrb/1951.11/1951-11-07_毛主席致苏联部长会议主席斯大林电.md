    To Comrade Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:
    On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and myself, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet people, the Soviet Government, and to you.
    Please allow me to congratulate you on the great achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction and the communist construction that is now beginning, achievements that have given the working people of the world boundless courage to fight for a bright future.
    Please allow me to congratulate you on the great victory of the Soviet Union's peace policy, which has frustrated the despicable conspiracies of the instigators of war, united the peace-loving people of the world, and convinced them that peace can triumph over war.
    Please allow me to congratulate you on the increasingly close and unshakable great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, a friendship that includes one-third of the world's population and is the most reliable guarantee of the inevitable victory of the cause of world peace and progress.
