　　Support Criticism of Anti-Historical Tendencies: Launch a Mass Criticism
Editor: I believe that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's anti-historical viewpoint on opera reform involves the fundamental issues of our opera reform policy, and this debate is of a principled nature. Because this tendency has become very serious in the opera reform work in some areas, if this erroneous thought is not thoroughly criticized and corrected, it will turn our excellent national artistic heritage into something that is neither fish nor fowl. For example, a Yue opera troupe in Xuancheng County performed a play called "Resisting Qin and Aiding Zhao," deliberately giving the Qin envoy a big nose and speaking with a foreign accent, to imply that the envoy was an "American." When a troupe in Guangde County performed "Pearl Pagoda," they forcibly changed the second half so that Fang Qing did not pass the imperial examination but joined Li Chuang's revolutionary forces, and through Fang Qing's mouth, they implied that intellectuals can only find a way out by integrating with the workers and peasants. When a troupe in Nanling County performed "Chuang Wang Enters Beijing," they even added slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism." Are these methods of forcibly adding modern things and modern people's thoughts to the ancients, using fabrication or arbitrary additions, as Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said, "in line with historical materialism and dialectical materialism"? Obviously, any method of deviating from historical authenticity and the conditions of the times by means of fabrication or arbitrary additions is of no benefit to opera reform work. We must fight against the anti-historical tendencies in opera reform, because this issue is universal, so this debate is not only a good education for Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, but also beneficial to the people's opera cause.

### 拥护对反历史主义倾向  展开群众性的批评

　　拥护对反历史主义倾向  展开群众性的批评
    编辑同志：我觉得杨绍萱同志对于戏曲改革所坚持的反历史主义的观点，牵涉到了我们戏曲改革政策的基本问题，这个争论是带有原则性的。因为这种倾向在若干地区的戏曲改革工作中已经发展得很严重，如果不将这种错误思想予以彻底批判，加以纠正，那么会把我们优秀的民族艺术遗产变成不伦不类的东西。例如宣城县某越剧团曾上演一个名为“抗秦援赵”的戏，把秦国的使者故意安上一个大鼻子，满口洋腔，以暗示此使者是“美国佬”。广德县某剧团上演“珍珠塔”时，把后半部硬改成方卿没有中状元，而去参加了李闯王的革命队伍，并由方卿口中暗示知识分子只有与工农群众相结合才有出路。南陵县某剧团在上演“闯王进京”时，甚至加进了“打倒美帝国主义”等口号。难道这些将现代的事物和现代人的思想硬加到古人身上去，是如杨绍萱同志所说的“合乎历史唯物论和辩证唯物论”吗？很显然，任何脱离历史的真实性和时代条件而用捏造或随意添改的方法，对于戏曲改革工作是没有任何好处的。我们必须对戏曲改革中的反历史主义倾向进行斗争，因为这问题具有普遍性，所以这个论争不但对于杨绍萱同志是很好的教育，而且对人民的戏曲事业也是有利的。
