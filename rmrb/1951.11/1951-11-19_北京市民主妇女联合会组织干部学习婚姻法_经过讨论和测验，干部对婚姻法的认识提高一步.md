Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation
    Organizes Cadres to Study Marriage Law
    Through Discussion and Testing, Cadres' Understanding of the Marriage Law is Improved.
    From October 22nd to November 6th, the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation organized cadres of the organization to study the Marriage Law. The study time was one hour each day. After the study, a test was held on November 6th. The test content was: (1) What are the principles of the New Democratic marriage system? (2) What are the characteristics of the feudal marriage system? (3) According to the Marriage Law, under what conditions can a divorce be granted? Under what conditions cannot a divorce be granted? (4) According to the Marriage Law, what are the rights and obligations between husband and wife? If you are married, how many points would you give yourself and your spouse in fulfilling these rights and obligations (assuming a full score is 100)? (5) What are the Marriage Law's regulations regarding illegitimate children? (6) Have you ever suffered feudal oppression and persecution in marriage issues? How did you handle it? (7) Before or after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, what thoughts and behaviors have you had in your own marriage issues and those of your family and friends that violated the spirit and principles of the Marriage Law? What is your understanding now? A total of forty people participated in the test, and thirteen failed, indicating that some comrades do not pay enough attention to the Marriage Law and do not fully understand its spirit.
    The study method mainly combined reading documents with examining one's own thoughts. The Women's Federation Study Committee designated six required reading materials: (1) The State Council's instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law and the People's Daily editorial on September 29th; (2) the Marriage Law; (3) the joint notification of the five major national people's organizations on implementing the Marriage Law (published in the People's Daily on September 29th); (4) Comrade Deng Yingchao's report on the Marriage Law (a speech at the enlarged cadre meeting in Zhangjiakou City in May 1950); (5) Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods"; (6) the "New China Women" issue 24 editorial "Concern for Women's Well-being, Support Women's Struggle." The discussion focus formulated by the Study Committee was: (1) After the State Council announced the instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, what new understandings do you have? (2) Combine with reality to examine your attitude towards the struggle of women to strive for freedom of marriage and oppose the feudal marriage system.
    After this study, the cadres of the Women's Federation have improved ideologically. Some comrades have also improved their work. Ideological progress is manifested in the following points:
    (1) From the facts that many women have been killed or forced to commit suicide due to marriage issues, and that some cadres have interfered with the masses' freedom of marriage, after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, it is recognized that the implementation of the Marriage Law is a long-term and arduous struggle against the influence of feudal ideology.
    (2) They realized the importance of caring for women's lives and supporting women's struggles. In the past, many comrades believed that marriage-related events were not within the scope of their work and they could ignore them. Some also regarded marriage issues as "trivial matters of life," and some regarded the implementation of the Marriage Law as only the responsibility of comrades in the Women's Federation who do marriage work, and that it had nothing to do with themselves. These views have now been corrected.
    (3) The feudal ideas of the cadres themselves were cleared, such as correcting the past incorrect views on open social interaction between men and women and on the issue of illegitimate children.
    Through this study and testing, the cadres of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation have greatly improved their understanding of the Marriage Law. This experience is worth referring to by various units when organizing cadres to study the Marriage Law and inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law.

　　北京市民主妇女联合会
    组织干部学习婚姻法
    经过讨论和测验，干部对婚姻法的认识提高一步
    北京市民主妇女联合会在十月二十二日至十一月六日组织本机关干部进行关于婚姻法的学习。学习时间每天为一小时。学习以后曾于十一月六日举行测验。测验内容为：（一）新民主主义的婚姻制度有那几个原则？（二）封建主义的婚姻制度有那些特点？（三）根据婚姻法在什么条件下可以离婚？什么条件下不可离婚？（四）根据婚姻法夫妻之间有那些权利和义务？如果你已结婚，你和你的爱人在履行这些权利和义务上可得多少分（假若满分是一百）？（五）婚姻法对于非婚生子有什么规定？（六）你曾否在婚姻问题上遭受过封建压迫和迫害，你是怎样处理的？（七）婚姻法公布前或公布后，你在你自己和你家属、亲友的婚姻问题上，曾有过那些违反婚姻法的精神与原则的思想和行为，你现在认识如何？这次参加测验的共四十人，有十三人不及格，说明一部分同志对婚姻法还不够重视，对它的精神还体会得不够。
    学习的方法主要是阅读文件与检查自己的思想相结合。妇联学委会指定了六个必读文件：（一）政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示与九月二十九日人民日报社论，（二）婚姻法，（三）全国五大人民团体关于贯彻婚姻法的联合通知（载九月二十九日人民日报），（四）邓颖超同志关于婚姻法的报告（一九五○年五月在张家口市扩大干部会上的演讲），（五）毛主席著“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，（六）“新中国妇女”二十四期社论“关心妇女生活，支援妇女斗争”。学委会拟定的讨论重点是：（一）政务院公布关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示后，你有那些新的认识？（二）结合实际检查自己对于妇女群众争取婚姻自由、反对封建婚姻制度的斗争的态度。
    妇联干部经过此次学习，在思想上都提高了一步，有的同志还改进了自己的工作。思想上的进步表现在下列各点：
    （一）从婚姻法公布以后还有许多妇女因为婚姻问题被杀、被迫自杀以及某些干部干涉群众婚姻自由的事实，认识到贯彻婚姻法是一个长期的艰苦的反封建思想影响的斗争。
    （二）认识到关心妇女生活，支援妇女斗争的重要性。过去有许多同志认为有关婚姻的事件不在自己工作范围以内可以不去管它，也有把婚姻问题看做是“生活屑事”的，也有把贯彻婚姻法看做只是妇联做婚姻工作同志的事，与自己无关，这些观点现在都已纠正了。
    （三）清除了干部本身的封建思想，例如纠正了过去对男女社交公开和对非婚生子问题的不正确看法。
    北京市妇联干部通过这次学习和测验，对婚姻法的认识提高了不少。这个经验值得各单位组织干部学习婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行情况时参考。
