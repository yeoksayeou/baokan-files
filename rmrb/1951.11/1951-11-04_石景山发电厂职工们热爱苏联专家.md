    Stone Mountain Power Plant Workers Love Soviet Experts
    Wang Zimian, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Branch of Shijingshan Power Plant
    Before liberation, the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant was a notorious "dark company." The Kuomintang reactionaries carried out a lot of anti-Soviet propaganda within the plant. After liberation, the workers still had many incorrect understandings of the Soviet Union. In September 1949, the plant's No. × generator (the plant's main unit) was sabotaged by special agents. The workers' morale was low, feeling as if half the sky had fallen; the technicians felt it would be difficult to repair under the existing conditions. At this time, Soviet experts came to the plant to help with the repair work. In the beginning, the vast majority of workers did not actively learn the superior techniques of the Soviet experts. Some workers even doubted the abilities of the Soviet experts. After the Soviet experts actually participated in the repair work, because they were not only hard-working, not afraid of getting dirty, and treated the workers like brothers, but also often patiently explained various techniques and scientific principles to the workers, many practical difficulties in the work were solved one by one. The No. × generator was finally repaired, which made many workers praise them in unison. At this time, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association used these concrete examples to extensively educate the workers, organizing forums for labor models, technicians, etc., comparing the Soviet Union with imperialist countries, so that the workers could distinguish between ourselves and the enemy politically. On Stalin's seventieth birthday, the workers wrote letters of congratulations to Stalin, sent a model of the repaired No. × machine as a gift, and held a celebration with the Soviet experts. When the Soviet experts spoke at the meeting, they constantly praised the wisdom and talent of the Chinese working class, but did not mention their own contributions, which deeply moved many workers. The workers themselves composed the song "Good Brothers," which spread throughout the plant. In this way, the workers' incorrect understanding of the Soviet Union began to change.
    After the No. × machine was repaired, the plant launched a large-scale production competition. In order to make full use of the original equipment and unleash the potential power of the machines, the Soviet experts carefully examined the equipment and machine performance of the entire plant, and provided a total of two hundred and nine extremely important improvement suggestions, large and small, within half a year. For example, in order to improve boiler efficiency and extend boiler life, they proposed a method for treating water hardness; in order to reduce costs, they advocated the extensive use of extraction steam (waste steam); in order to ensure safe power generation, they proposed adding wire mesh around the transformers. The plant's technicians and workers had rarely thought of or heard of these problems in the past. When they were first proposed, they were opposed by technicians with serious conservative ideas. Some thought these improvements were not important; some thought they were impossible; some lacked confidence in the entire plant, thinking that our plant was full of "old and broken machines" that were difficult to handle, and it would be better to buy some new ones from abroad.
    At this time, the Shijingshan Power Plant Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party concentrated the opinions of the Soviet experts, and after research by the Party Committee and discussion by the Factory Management Committee, formulated a concrete plan for phased implementation. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, through picture exhibitions, current affairs boards, forums, and other means, continuously publicized the superiority of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, in economy and technology, and the happy life of the Soviet people, criticized the workers' incorrect understanding of the Soviet Union and their conservative and dependent thinking on technology, and called on everyone to resolutely follow the suggestions of the Soviet experts to change the plant's coal consumption, output, and safety conditions. In this way, in coordination with the leadership of the Party, administration, and trade union and the education of the workers, a movement to learn advanced Soviet technology gradually unfolded among the advanced workers. Labor model Liu Dezhen was originally a fifth-grade worker. Because he tirelessly studied with Soviet experts, his technology has now improved to the eighth grade. The plant's repair tasks for several steam turbines this year were all successfully completed under the direct leadership of Liu Dezhen with the help of Soviet experts and the efforts of the workers. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers over the past two years and the improvements in various aspects based on the suggestions of the Soviet experts, the plant's coal consumption has decreased, the power generation load has increased, and accidents have been greatly reduced. In 1949, there were 113 major accidents in the plant, which decreased to 38 in 1950, and only two by mid-October 1951. In implementing the suggestions of the Soviet experts, the use of extraction steam (waste steam) alone has saved the country 2,700 tons of coal. All the workers in the plant have experienced the all-round help from the Soviet experts in their actual work, which has changed the views of many people. Now, when they see the Soviet experts coming, the workers gather around to ask questions. The technicians ask them for advice. After they leave, the workers ask what suggestions they have left behind. The Soviet experts have become truly admired and beloved friends of all the workers.

    石景山发电厂职工们热爱苏联专家
    石景山发电厂中苏友好协会支会副会长  王自勉
    在解放以前，北京石景山发电厂是有名的“黑暗公司”，国民党反动派在厂内，曾作了很多反苏宣传。解放以后，职工们对苏联还存在着很多不正确的认识。一九四九年九月，厂内×号发电机（系全厂主力机）遭特务破坏。工友们情绪低落，感到好像塌了半边天；技术人员都感到在现有条件下难以修复。这时，厂内来了苏联专家，帮助进行修复工程。开始，绝大多数职工都不主动学习苏联专家的优良技术。甚至有的职工对苏联专家的能力还抱怀疑态度。苏联专家实际参加了修复工作之后，由于他们在工作中不但吃苦耐劳，不怕脏，待工友亲如兄弟，并且还经常耐心地向职工讲解各种技术及科学原理，工作中很多实际困难都一一解决，×号发电机终于修复了，这使很多职工齐声称赞。这时，中苏友好协会就拿这些具体事例，广泛教育职工，组织了劳动模范、技术人员等各种座谈会，拿苏联和帝国主义国家对比，使职工们从政治上分清敌我界线。在斯大林七十寿辰时，职工们给斯大林写了贺寿的信，送了修复的×号机的模型作礼物，并和苏联专家举行联欢会。苏联专家在会上讲话时，不断称赞中国工人阶级的智慧和才能，对自己的功劳却一句未提，这使很多职工深受感动。工人自己编了“哥俩好”的歌子，唱遍了全厂。这样，职工们对苏联的不正确的认识开始有了改变。
    ×号机修复后，厂里展开了大规模的生产竞赛。苏联专家为使充分利用原有设备，发挥机器潜在力量，曾仔细考查了全厂的设备和机器性能，从大到小，在半年之内共提供了二百零九条极关重要的改进意见。例如为了提高锅炉的效率和延长锅炉寿命，提出水硬度的处理方法；为了降低成本，提倡大量利用抽汽（废汽）；为了安全发电，提出在变压器周围加设铁丝网。类似这些问题，厂里的技术人员和工人过去都很少想到或听到过。刚提出时，首先遭到有严重保守思想的技术人员的反对。有的认为这些改进不重要；有的认为不可能；有的对整厂子没信心，认为我厂都是“老小三辈的破机器”，不好摆弄，不如从外国买些新的。
    这时，中共石景山发电厂党委会集中了苏联专家的意见，经过党委会的研究和工厂管理委员会的讨论，订出了分期执行的具体计划。中苏友好协会则通过图片展览、时事牌、座谈会等方式，不断宣传社会主义国家苏联在经济、技术上的优越性及苏联人民的幸福生活，批判职工对苏联的错误认识及技术上的保守、依赖思想，号召大家坚决根据苏联专家的建议，改变电厂的煤耗、出力和安全状况。这样配合党、行政、工会的领导和对职工的教育，逐渐在先进职工中展开了学习苏联先进技术的运动。劳动模范刘德珍原是一个五级工，由于他不倦地跟苏联专家学习，他的技术现已提高到八级。厂里今年的数台汽机检修任务，都是在苏联专家的帮助下，由刘德珍直接领导工友努力完成的。由于全体工友两年来的努力和根据苏联专家的建议，各方面改进的结果，厂里的煤耗降低、发电负荷增高，而事故却大大减少了。一九四九年厂里发生重大事故一百一十三次，一九五○年减少到三十八次，一九五一年到十月中旬止，只有两次了。在实行苏联专家的建议中，仅利用抽汽（废汽）一项，已给国家节省了二千七百吨煤。厂里全体职工在实际工作中体验到苏联专家对于我们关怀备至的帮助，这使很多人改变了自己的看法。现在见苏联专家来了，职工们围上去问长问短，技术人员向他们请教。等他们走了，工友们就问给留下了什么意见。苏联专家已经成为全体职工真正钦佩和敬爱的朋友了。
