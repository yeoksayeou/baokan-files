    Self-Criticism Regarding Grammatical Errors in Workers' Literacy Textbook
    Comrade Editor: Zhang Zaitian's letter was published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on October 17th, pointing out some grammatical inaccuracies in the third volume of the Workers' Literacy Textbook and suggesting that they be corrected in the reprint. We sincerely accept this suggestion and are determined to improve our work.
    The literacy textbooks we compiled this time, except for the content of the first volume, which was based on the first draft of the new literacy textbook compiled by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the remaining three volumes were rushed out in forty days. We did not carefully modify the selected teaching materials, and we did not carefully proofread them during printing, resulting in many grammatical errors. This shows that our work attitude is not serious enough. In the future, we must treat our work with a serious and responsible attitude and overcome the shortcomings in our work. Currently, we have decided to take the following remedial measures:
    1. The errors discovered when the first batch of literacy textbooks was printed have been corrected during reprinting. We are now beginning to carefully check all the literacy textbooks and have decided to issue errata and correction sheets for teachers and students to refer to for self-correction.
    2. All literacy textbooks will be revised when they are reprinted.

### 北京市文教局工农教育处  关于职工识字课本发生语法错误的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市文教局工农教育处
    关于职工识字课本发生语法错误的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报十月十七日“读者来信专页”发表了张在田同志的来信，指出职工识字课本第三册在语法上有不妥的地方，并建议在重版时予以修正。我们诚恳地接受这个意见，并决心改进我们的工作。
    我们这次编印的识字课本，除第一册的内容系根据中央人民政府教育部新编识字课本第一册初稿外，其余三册都是在四十天之内赶编出来的，对选用的教材没有认真地加以修改，在印刷时我们也未认真地进行校阅，以致发生了不少语法上的错误。这说明了我们的工作态度还不够严肃，今后一定要以认真负责的态度，对待自己的工作，克服工作中的缺点。目前我们决定采取下列补救办法：
    一、识字课本第一批印出时发现的错误，已在加印时改正。现在我们正着手将全部识字课本详细检查一遍，决定印发正误表和修正表，由教师和学员自行参照修改。
    二、识字课本重版时，将全部予以修订。
                    北京市人民政府文教局工农教育处
