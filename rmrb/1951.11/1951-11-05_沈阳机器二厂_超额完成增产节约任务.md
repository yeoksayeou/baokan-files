    Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant
    Overfulfills Production Increase and Savings Task
    The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant had completed its production increase and savings plan of 75,653 tons of grain by the end of the third quarter, exceeding the state-assigned task (64,874 tons) by 17%.
    The plant's task of saving funds was 30,555 tons of grain. By the end of the third quarter, it had actually completed 33,132 tons of grain, exceeding the task set by the higher authorities. The higher authorities stipulated that the plant's circulating fund turnover period for the second half of 1951 should be 110 days. By the end of September, it had actually been shortened to 109.35 days, a reduction of 0.65 days. Under the call for massive savings in working capital, the plant's employees are creating more wealth every moment. Taking sales work as an example, the capital turnover period at the end of March this year was 424 days. Since the increase in production and savings, a responsibility system has been established for handling backlogged funds. For example, the manufacturing department proposed a production fund handling plan and assigned the task to the workshops; the supply department cleared backlogged materials; the sales department contacted various parties and vigorously promoted products; and the finance department handled creditor's rights and debts and made more rational use of monetary funds. The Northeast Bureau of Machine Building Industry stipulated that the inventory days of finished product funds should be 30 days. By the end of September, the plant had reduced it to 14 days. All workshops have completely cleared the cast steel parts that had not been delivered for the past two years.
    Since October, the plant has also made several major improvements in technical measures. For example, after the open-hearth furnace was overhauled, a new method of sintering the furnace bottom was adopted, which can increase output by one-third compared with before the overhaul. The ductile iron casting has been successfully tested and can be used in some important castings and forgings, which will greatly benefit product quality, machine life, and savings in materials and labor. Now, the entire plant has developed from discussing and signing collective contracts to signing contact contracts in many aspects, improving on the basis of the original production increase and savings plan and creating more wealth for the country.

    沈阳机器二厂
    超额完成增产节约任务
    沈阳机器二厂已于第三季末完成七万五千六百五十三吨粮食的增产节约计划，超过国家所给任务
    （六万四千八百七十四吨）的百分之十七。
    该厂节约资金的任务是三万零五百五十五吨粮食，到第三季末，实际已完成三万三千一百三十二吨粮，超过了上级规定的任务。上级规定该厂一九五一年下半年资金周转期为一百一十天，到九月底，实际缩短到一百零九点三五天，缩短了零点六五天。在大量节约流动资金的号召下，该厂职工们每时每刻都在创造更多的财富。就推销工作来说，今年三月末资金周转期达四百二十四天，自增产节约以来，在处理积压资金上订了责任制。如制造部门提出生产资金处理计划，把任务布置到车间；供应部门清理了积压材料；推销部门与各方面联络，大量推销产品；财务部门处理债权债务，更合理地利用了货币资金。东北机械工业管理局规定成品资金库存日数为三十天，该厂到九月末，已缩短到十四天；各车间把两年来未交清的铸钢件全部清理完竣。
    十月份以来，该厂在技术措施上，也有了几件重大改进。如平炉经过大修理后，采用了新的烧结炉底的方法，较未修前可提高产量三分之一；球墨铸铁已试验成功，在一些重要铸件、锻件上都可采用，这对产品质量，机器寿命，节省材料、人工上，都有很大收获。现全厂又由讨论订集体合同发展到多方面订联系合同，在原有增产节约计划的基础上提高一步，为国家创造了更多的财富。（杨洛林）
