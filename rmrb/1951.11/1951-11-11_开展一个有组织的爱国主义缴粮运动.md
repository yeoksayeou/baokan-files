Launch an Organized Patriotic Grain Contribution Campaign

The autumn harvest work has largely concluded across the country, and the autumn agricultural tax collection work is about to be fully launched. This is the most important task for governments at all levels at present. We must further strengthen the patriotic education of farmers, earnestly implement the policies and regulations on agricultural tax collection, and strengthen the organization of farmers' grain contributions, so as to launch an organized patriotic grain contribution campaign and better complete this year's grain collection work.

What issues should be noted in this year's grain collection work?

First, we should further strengthen the patriotic political education and burden policy education of farmers. Some people say, "Now the farmers' awareness has been greatly improved. As long as a call is made, the public grain can be paid in full." The basis for this estimate is that, after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the farmers' political awareness has indeed been further improved. Moreover, due to the patriotic production increase movement and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the farmers' lives have also improved, so it is natural to love the motherland even more. However, it would be wrong to say that there will be no difficulties in this year's autumn agricultural tax collection, that there is no need to put in effort, and that the task will be completed smoothly without doing much work. We must fully estimate that: First, this year's agricultural tax rate is slightly higher than last year due to the needs of national defense and economic construction. Therefore, the burden on farmers is somewhat increased compared to last year. Second, land reform has been completed in most areas of the newly liberated areas, and land has been transferred from landlords to farmers. Last year, agricultural taxes in the new areas were largely paid by landlords in form, but these agricultural taxes are now directly borne by farmers. Third, although farmers' production has increased, this increase should not be overestimated because farmers have enthusiastically donated airplanes and cannons. These three conditions will create certain difficulties in this year's agricultural tax collection work. Therefore, we must repeatedly publicize and explain to the farmers, so that they understand the relationship between immediate and long-term interests, and the relationship between partial and overall interests. We must make farmers understand that only by defending the country can we protect our homes and defend the fruits of victory; paying public grain is the duty of citizens; only by consolidating the state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance can we vigorously develop production and improve living standards. We must guide farmers to consciously and voluntarily strive to realize the people's government's agricultural tax collection policies and regulations. When publicizing grain collection work, do not just generally put forward the slogan of "paying patriotic grain," but focus on putting forward specific slogans such as "patriotic farmers truthfully report the acreage and yield," "patriotic farmers pay taxes according to the rate," and "patriotic farmers pay good grain on time," organically linking political education with burden policy education. We must be highly vigilant against rumors and sabotage by special agents and lawless landlords, and expose and refute them at any time. The tendency to neglect propaganda and education work is the root cause of coercive commandism and must be strictly prevented.

Second, we must implement the policy of checking fields and determining yields, calculating taxes according to the rate, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law. The tax rate is the concentrated expression of the people's government's burden policy, and calculating taxes according to the rate is the basic method of implementing the burden policy. Therefore, wherever mass conditions are already in place, for example, areas where rent reduction, deposit refunds, suppression of bandits, and opposition to霸道 have been implemented, or areas where land reform has already been implemented, we should strive to implement checking fields and determining yields, and calculating taxes according to the rate. It would be wrong not to implement this policy. According to reports, most areas have been working hard to implement this policy in last year's autumn collection and this year's summer collection. However, there are still individual areas and some cadres who doubt and oppose this policy. They still advocate "fixed tasks, flexible tax rates," which is actually opposing calculating taxes according to the rate. These comrades are accustomed to coercive commandism and simply doing things, and are unwilling to do patient work. They only have a simple "task" viewpoint in their minds, and they make the task permanent and isolated. In the past, their worry was: "What if the task cannot be completed by calculating taxes according to the rate?" Later, facts proved that calculating taxes according to the rate can completely complete the "task," and complete it better. Now they have new worries: "What if calculating taxes according to the rate exceeds the task?" In short, they have only one purpose, to demand "fixed tasks, flexible tax rates." It should be pointed out that in the past, the masses were not fully mobilized, and we did not have time to completely investigate the population, land, and yield. Therefore, we had to adopt the method of distributing "tasks." Therefore, in the past, it cannot be said that this was wrong. But it cannot be said that this is a method that should be preserved forever. On the contrary, even at that time, the distributed "tasks" inevitably had some blindness, and therefore the phenomenon of uneven burden was difficult to completely avoid. Now, we already have a better mass work foundation, and it is possible to implement checking fields and determining yields, and calculating taxes according to the rate. Why not implement it? Only by implementing checking fields and determining yields, and calculating taxes according to the rate, can the burden on farmers be fair and reasonable, can the phenomenon of uneven burden be overcome, can farmers understand the "bottom line" of tax collection and dare to let go of production, can cadres be required to handle affairs according to law, and can all classes be satisfied. This is a policy that is beneficial and harmless. Moreover, this year's tax law and tax rate were carefully formulated by the major administrative regions based on the unified policy of the central government and based on the specific conditions of the local area, and were reported to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval, which is more suitable for the specific conditions of various places than last year. What reason is there not to implement calculating taxes according to the rate?

The basis of calculating taxes according to the rate is checking fields and determining yields. Therefore, wherever conditions are in place, checking fields and determining yields must be carried out as much as possible. In the method of determining yield, the method of "assessing land grades from bottom to top and investigating and determining yield from top to bottom" should be generally adopted, that is, the masses in each township assess the grade of the land, and then the land grades of several townships or even the entire region are merged, and the yield is determined by the county and district people's representatives. This method is convenient for attracting the broad masses to prevent the malpractice of selfishness, and the determined yield is relatively easy to be true and balanced, laying a good foundation for calculating taxes according to the rate. Another aspect of calculating taxes according to the rate is reducing or exempting taxes according to law. The tax amount must be reduced or exempted for taxpayers who have suffered reduced harvests due to disasters, and for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers who lack labor and are poor, and for orphans, widows, the disabled, and the elderly who are poor. East China and Central South also stipulate that appropriate care should be given to farmers who have newly obtained land, which is also very good.

Third, earnestly do a good job in the organizational work of grain collection. The so-called doing a good job in the organizational work of grain collection, from a national perspective, is to calculate the population, land, and yield of about 100 million farm households clearly within a short period of two to three months on the basis of past work (many places have done a lot of work), and calculate the amount of tax payable by each household without error; it is to mobilize tens of millions of farmers to dry and clean tens of billions of catties of grain, and transport the grain to the warehouse in an orderly manner and on time with handcarts, shoulder poles, small boats, and large carts; it is to weigh tens of billions of catties of grain bag by bag and basket by basket in a short period of time with wooden steelyards and a few scales, and issue receipts. Just imagine: What a huge, complex, and meticulous organizational work this is! If there is any negligence in the planning, organization, and inspection of this work, confusion will occur. How can we not pay enough attention to it? However, in last year's autumn collection and this year's summer collection, some areas were satisfied with the "vigorous" phenomenon of farmers paying grain, and regarded such a major organizational task as a "technical work" that was "irrelevant to major policy," as a result, in some areas, errors in tax calculation, excessive moisture in grain, and chaotic grain delivery order were created, thereby increasing many difficulties in storage, causing serious waste of people's and national wealth, and even serious phenomena such as casualties of people and animals. This year, these shortcomings and errors must be corrected, and the organizational work of grain collection must be done well. All the work, such as the calculation of the tax amount, the delivery of the tax payment notice, the drying and cleaning of the grain, the organization of grain delivery, the settlement of accounts, and the collection of arrears, must be carefully planned and organized.

Full patriotic political education is the prerequisite and foundation for implementing the burden policy and doing a good job in the organizational work of grain collection. This is one aspect. On the other hand, only by earnestly implementing the burden policy and strictly organizing the grain collection work so that farmers can pay grain in an orderly manner according to reasonable methods can the farmers' patriotic enthusiasm for paying grain be further consolidated and promoted. Neglecting political education, or neglecting the implementation of the burden policy and organizational work, is not right.

Agricultural tax collection is a major political task. Leading cadres of governments at all levels must deeply recognize that agricultural tax is a major event related to hundreds of millions of farmers, and it is one of the important sources of national revenue. This is a major event concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, it is required that governments at all levels regard it as the central task for a certain period of time. In areas where land reform has not yet been completed, it should be arranged appropriately. Neither should the collection time be prolonged, affecting land reform, nor should the collection work be done hastily due to eagerness to carry out land reform. It is hoped that governments at all levels will strengthen leadership and ensure the complete victory of the autumn collection work.

### 开展一个有组织的爱国主义缴粮运动

    开展一个有组织的爱国主义缴粮运动
    全国各地秋收工作已大体结束，农业税秋季征粮工作，即将全面开展，这是各级人民政府当前的最重要的一项工作。必须进一步加强对农民的爱国主义教育，必须切实贯彻农业税收的政策法令，必须加强农民缴纳公粮的组织性，以便开展一个有组织的爱国主义缴粮运动，更好地完成今年的征粮工作。
    今年征粮工作中应当注意那些问题呢？
    应进一步加强对农民的爱国主义政治教育和负担政策的教育。有人说：“现在农民觉悟已经大大提高，只要一声号召，就可以把公粮缴齐。”这一估计的根据是，经过抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动后，农民的政治觉悟确是进一步提高了，更由于爱国丰产运动和城乡物资交流，农民在生活上也得到了改善，因而更加热爱祖国，这是很自然的。但因此就说今年农业税秋季征收没有什么困难，用不着费劲，用不着做多少工作，就会一帆风顺地完成任务，却是错误的。必须足够估计到：第一、今年农业税的税率由于国防和经济建设的要求比去年略有提高，因而，农民的负担是比去年增加了些。第二、新解放区大部地区土地改革已经完成，土地由地主手里转移到农民手里，去年新区的农业税不少在形式上是由地主手里缴出，这些农业税今年却是由农民直接来负担。第三、农民生产虽有增加，但因农民普遍踊跃地捐献了飞机大炮，所以这种增加不能估计过高。这三个条件，都将形成今年农业税征收工作的某些困难。因此，我们必须对农民反复进行宣传解释，使农民认识到眼前利益和远大利益、局部利益和全局利益的关系，要使农民懂得：只有卫国才能保家，才能保卫胜利的果实；缴纳公粮是国民的天职，只有巩固了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的国家，才能大力发展生产，才能改善生活；要引导农民自觉自愿地为实现人民政府的农业税收政策和法令而奋斗。在宣传征粮工作时，不要只是一般地提出“缴爱国粮”的口号，而要着重提出：“爱国农民实报田亩产量”、“爱国农民依率缴税”、“爱国农民按时缴好粮”等具体口号，把政治教育和负担政策的教育有机地联系起来。要十分警惕特务分子和不法地主的造谣破坏，随时予以揭发和驳斥。忽视宣传教育工作的倾向，正是强迫命令作风的根源，必须严加防止。
    其次，必须贯彻查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的方针。税率是人民政府负担政策的集中表现，依率计征乃是贯彻负担政策的基本方法。因此，凡是群众条件已经具备的地方，比如说实行过减租、退押、清匪、反霸，或已经实行了土地改革的地区，应一律争取实行查田定产、依率计征，不实行这一方针则是错误的。根据报告，在去年秋征和今年夏征中，绝大部分地区已在努力贯彻这一方针。但是还有个别地区和部分干部怀疑和反对这一方针，他们仍然主张“死任务、活税率”，实际上就是反对依率计征。这些同志习惯于强迫命令、简单从事，而不愿意做耐烦的工作，脑中只有单纯的“任务”观点，而且把任务永恒化、孤立化。过去他们忧虑的是：“依率计征完不成任务怎么办？”后来事实证明依率计征完全可以完成“任务”，而且完成得更好。现在他们又发生新的忧虑：“依率计征超过任务怎么办？”总之，他们目的只有一个，要求“死任务、活税率”。应该指出，在过去，群众尚未充分发动，我们还没有来得及把人口、土地、产量完全查清楚，因而不得不采取分配“任务”的办法；因此，在过去，不能说这是错误的。但也不能说这是应该永远保存的办法；恰恰相反，即在当时，分配的“任务”也难免带有某些盲目性，因而负担上畸轻畸重的现象也难完全避免。现在，我们已经有了较好的群众工作基础，已经有可能实行查田定产、依率计征，为什么还不实行呢？只有实行查田定产、依率计征，才能使农民负担公平合理，才能克服畸轻畸重现象，才能使农民摸到税收的“底”，敢于放手生产，才能要求干部依法办事，才能使各阶层同表满意。这是有利无弊的政策。并且今年的税法税率是各大行政区根据中央统一的政策并根据当地的具体情况慎重拟订、报经中央人民政府政务院核准的，较之去年更加适合各地具体情况，还有什么理由不实行依率计征呢？
    依率计征的基础是查田定产。所以只要条件具备了的地方，一定要尽可能的进行查田定产。在定产方法上，应普遍采用“自下而上评订地等，自上而下调查定产”的方法，即由各乡群众评出田地等级，再把几个乡以至全区的田地等级合并起来，由县区人民代表会订定产量。这种方法便于吸引广大群众防止自私本位的流弊，订出的产量比较容易做到真实平衡，为依率计征打好基础。依率计征的另一方面就是依法减免，对于因灾歉收的纳税户及烈、军、工属缺乏劳力而生活贫困者，孤寡残老生活贫困者，必须减免其税额。华东和中南并规定对新得地农民给予适当的照顾，也是很好的。
    第三，切实做好征粮中的组织工作。所谓做好征粮中的组织工作，从全国范围说，就是要在过去工作的基础上（许多地方都做了不少工作）在短短的两三个月内把大约一万万个农户的人口、土地、产量计算清楚，计算出每户应纳的税额而没有错误；就是要动员几万万农民把多少万万斤粮食晒干扬净，并用手推车、扁担、小船、大车等有秩序地按时送粮入仓，就是要用木杆秤和少数磅秤在短促的时间内把多少万万斤粮食一袋一箩地秤清楚，并开给收据。试想：这是何等庞大、复杂而细腻的组织工作？如果对这一工作的计划、组织、检查稍有疏忽，就会发生混乱现象，我们怎能不加以足够的重视呢？但是，在去年秋征和今年夏征中，某些地区曾满足于农民缴粮“轰轰烈烈”的现象，把如此重大的组织任务，看成“无关大政方针”的“技术工作”，结果，在某些地区就造成了税额计算错误、粮食水分过大、送粮秩序混乱，因而增加了保管上的许多困难，造成人民和国家财富严重浪费，甚至发生人畜伤亡等严重现象。今年必须改正这些缺点和错误，做好征粮的组织工作。举凡税额的计算、纳税通知书的送达、粮食的扬晒、送粮的组织、账目的清结、尾欠的清收等一系列的工作，都要求认真加以计划和组织。
    充分的爱国主义政治教育是贯彻负担政策，做好征粮组织工作的前提和基础，这是一方面；另一方面，只有切实贯彻负担政策，并对征粮工作加以严密的组织，使农民按照合理的办法有秩序地缴粮，农民缴粮的爱国热情，才能更加巩固和发扬起来。忽视政治教育，或者忽视贯彻负担政策和组织工作，都是不对的。
    农业税征收是一个重大的政治任务。各级人民政府的领导干部必须深切认识：农业税是关系几万万农民的大事，是国家财政重要收入之一，这是国计民生大事，不能等闲视之。因此，要求各级人民政府把它当作一定时期的中心工作，在尚未完成土地改革的地区，更应当适当安排，既不可拖长征收时间，影响土地改革，亦不可因急于进行土地改革，对征收工作潦草从事。希望各级人民政府加强领导，保证秋征工作的完全胜利。
