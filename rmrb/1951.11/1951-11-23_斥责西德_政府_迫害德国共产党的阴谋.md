    Denouncing the West German "Government's" Conspiracy to Persecute the German Communist Party
    In order to further suppress the patriotic movement of the West German people, the West German Bonn puppet government, on the 16th of this month, demanded that the so-called "Federal Constitutional Court" of West Germany declare the German Communist Party an organization that violates the "constitution." This illegal measure by the Bonn puppet is being carried out entirely under the orders of its American master. The Chinese people express serious protest against this blatant reactionary measure by American imperialism and its Bonn running dogs.
    American imperialism has already grossly violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, unilaterally ended the "state of war with Germany" with its vassal states, and is stepping up its efforts to cobble together the so-called "European Army" with West German mercenaries as its core, as capital for future wars of aggression. This criminal policy of American imperialism undoubtedly brings another bloody disaster to the German people and plunges the German nation into a devastating situation again, and has therefore been met with increasing opposition from the German people. The proposals of Prime Minister Grotewohl and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic regarding holding an all-German conference and establishing an all-German constitutional assembly to discuss and resolve the German question have received widespread response and enthusiastic support from the German people. The unreasonable rejection of these proposals by the West German puppets Heuss and Adenauer further exposes their and their American masters' criminal conspiracy to obstruct Germany's peace and unity.
    Under these circumstances, the movement demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and opposing remilitarization has achieved great success in West Germany. It is a serious blow to the American imperialist attempt to turn West Germany into a base of aggression in Europe. The reason why American imperialism is today directing its West German running dogs to take reactionary measures and conspiring to declare the German Communist Party illegal is precisely because it fears the power of the West German people demanding peaceful reunification, and attempts to destroy the German Communist Party, which leads this movement, in order to promote its war policy.
    Obviously, the perverse actions of American imperialism and its West German running dog, the Adenauer government, will not achieve their shameful goals. The German people have generally awakened, and they will continue to resolutely unite around the German Communist Party and persist in the struggle for the realization of German peace and unity, which will inevitably lead to the failure of all the shameful plots of American imperialism and its West German running dog, the Adenauer government.

    斥责西德“政府”迫害德国共产党的阴谋
    西德波恩傀儡政府为了进一步镇压西德人民的爱国运动，在本月十六日要求西德的所谓“联邦宪法法庭”宣布德国共产党为违反“宪法”的组织。波恩傀儡这一非法措施，是完全在它美国主子的命令下进行的。中国人民对于美帝国主义及其波恩走狗这一露骨的反动措施，表示严重的抗议。
    美帝国主义已经粗暴地违反了波茨坦协定的各项规定，与它的仆从国家片面地结束了“对德战争状态”，并正在加紧其拼凑以西德雇佣军为核心的所谓“欧洲军”，作为未来侵略战争的资本。美帝国主义这一罪恶政策，无疑地给德国人民带来另一次血腥的灾难，使德国民族再度陷于毁灭性的境地，因而受到了德国人民愈来愈增长的反对。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和人民议会关于举行全德会议与成立全德立宪会议以讨论与解决德国问题的建议，已获得了全德人民的普遍响应与热烈支持，而西德傀儡休斯和阿登纳对于这些建议的无理拒绝，则进一步暴露了它们及其美国主子阻挠德国的和平与统一的罪恶图谋。
    在这种情形下，要求缔结对德和约与反对重新军国主义化的运动，在西德得到了巨大的成就。对于美帝国主义企图把西德变为欧洲的侵略基地的阴谋，是一个严重的打击。美帝国主义今天之所以指使它的西德走狗采取反动措施，阴谋宣布德国共产党为非法，正是因为它恐惧西德人民要求和平统一的力量，企图摧毁领导这一运动的德国共产党，以便于推行它的战争政策。
    显然的，美帝国主义及其在西德的走狗阿登纳政府的倒行逆施，是不会达到它们可耻的目的的。德国人民已经普遍觉醒，他们将继续坚决地团结在德国共产党的周围，为实现德国和平与统一而坚持斗争，这就必然会使得美帝国主义及其西德走狗阿登纳政府的一切可耻图谋都归于失败。
