    I Should Not Treat Students with a Brutal and Savage Attitude
    Editor: I am a primary school teacher. After reading the brief commentary "Corporal Punishment Should Not Be Used to Replace Disciplinary Education" in the People's Daily on October 21st, I feel the need to examine myself. A month ago, there was a student in my school who was repeatedly late, did not hand in homework on time, and did not bring books and stationery to class. I resorted to beating him. I was really too brutal and savage. This shows that there are still strong old ideas in my thinking. In the future, I should use a democratic and healthy "enlightenment" approach to manage students, so that students can consciously abide by discipline.

    我不应用粗暴野蛮的态度对待学生
    编辑同志：我是一位小学教师，在我读了人民日报十月二十一日的“不应该用体罚来代替纪律教育”简评后，我觉得我有检讨的必要。在一个月前，我校有一位学生，他屡次迟到，不按时交作业，上课不带书籍文具。我就不择手段地把他打了一下。我实在太粗暴野蛮了。这说明我在思想上还存在着浓厚的旧意识。今后我应该用民主的健康的“启发”方式来管理学生，使学生能自觉地遵守纪律。
