　　Private Huaxing Construction Factory
    Illegally Seeking Profit Causes Worker Deaths and Injuries
    Editor: The new school building project of Qixin Cement Plant in Tangshan City was contracted by the private Huaxing Construction Factory. It was initially stated that 15 to 20 percent of the project bid price (over 1 billion yuan) would be used for scaffolding and framework costs. The project commenced on September 23rd. When building the workers' dormitories at the construction site, the construction factory, in order to greedily make money, only used simple methods of building with sorghum stalks and mud plastering on the roof, and used four-foot-long pine poles as the beams and columns of the sheds. In this way, five workers' dormitories were built. The Qixin Cement Plant Trade Union raised objections to the construction factory, believing that this method of building sheds was too dangerous, but the construction factory did not adopt their suggestions. On October 18th and 19th, it rained, and more than 20 workers were sheltering from the rain inside the sheds. At this time, the roof was leaking severely, and the workers threw soil onto the roof to block the leaks, thus increasing the weight of the roof. At around 3:00 PM, the roof collapsed, causing the death of one worker, seriously injuring one worker, and slightly injuring six workers.
    I believe that the Huaxing Construction Factory's illegal behavior of disregarding worker safety is intolerable and should be punished by law. The Qixin Cement Plant did not supervise them well and should also bear some responsibility. Relevant authorities should quickly handle this matter.

### 私营华兴营造厂  非法图利造成工人死伤事件

　　私营华兴营造厂
    非法图利造成工人死伤事件
    编辑同志：唐山市启新洋灰厂的新建校舍工程，是由私营华兴营造厂承包的。当初言明以工程标价（十亿多元）的百分之十五至二十作为搭棚、架木等费用。该工程于九月二十三日开工。在搭工人工地宿舍时，该营造厂为了贪图赚钱，只用秫秸搭盖和棚顶抹泥的简陋作法，并且用四尺长的松杆子作为棚子的梁柱。就这样盖了五座工人工地宿舍。启新洋灰厂工会曾向该营造厂提出意见，认为这种工棚的盖法太危险，但该营造厂没有采纳。十月十八、十九两日下雨，有二十多名工人在工棚内避雨。这时，屋顶漏雨很厉害，工人向棚顶扔土堵漏，因而增加了棚顶的重量，至下午三点钟左右，棚顶倒塌下来，造成压死工人一名，重伤一人，轻伤六人的事件。
    我认为华兴营造厂漠视工人安全的不法行为是不能容忍的，应该受到法律的制裁。启新洋灰厂没有很好地监督他们，也应负一定的责任。有关机关应赶快处理这件事。
