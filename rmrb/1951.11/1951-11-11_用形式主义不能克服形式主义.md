Formalism Cannot Overcome Formalism

    When the cadres of Beiyangtai Village, Cixian County, Hebei Province, mobilized the masses to revise the patriotic pact, they sent someone to beat a gong in the street and shout: "Everyone must revise the patriotic pact and post it on the gate within three days!" As a result, every household hurriedly looked for paper, pens, and literate people to "write" the patriotic pact. As a result, the patriotic pact was "revised," but in reality, it still couldn't solve any problems. When some elementary school teachers in Chengguan District, Lingling County, Hunan Province, helped the masses examine and revise the patriotic pact, they took the masses' patriotic pact and arbitrarily added or deleted it like grading a composition paper, without discussion and approval by the masses. As a result, the masses who formulated the patriotic pact did not know what content had been added or deleted.
    The reason why formalism tendencies arose in the patriotic pact movement is that some cadres and activists did not adopt the method of publicity and education, starting from raising the masses' political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm, and guiding the masses to fully deliberate and discuss to formulate patriotic pacts that fit their own work, production, and study situation; instead, they adopted the method of coercion or doing everything for the masses. Therefore, the pacts established had no relation to the masses, and naturally, they could not be implemented. Checking and revising the patriotic pact is an effective way to overcome this tendency. However, the method adopted by some cadres and activists in Beiyangtai Village, Cixian County, Hebei Province, and Chengguan District, Lingling County, Hunan Province, even if the patriotic pact is "revised" a thousand times, the formalism of the patriotic pact still cannot be overcome; on the contrary, it will make the masses feel that revising the patriotic pact is a burden. This tendency should be thoroughly corrected.

    用形式主义不能克服形式主义
    河北省磁县北羊台村干部在发动群众修订爱国公约时，曾派一个人敲着锣到大街上喊：“都要修订爱国公约，限三天贴到大门上！”这样一来，各家各户急忙找纸、找笔、找识字的人去“写”爱国公约。结果，爱国公约是“修订”了，但实际上仍不能解决什么问题。湖南省零陵县城关区某些小学教员在帮助群众检查修订爱国公约时，把群众的爱国公约拿来，像修改作文卷子一样，不经群众讨论通过，就随意增删一番。结果订爱国公约的群众，对公约的内容增删了些什么都不知道。
    爱国公约运动中之所以产生形式主义偏向，是因为有一部分干部和积极分子不是采取宣传教育的办法，从提高群众的政治觉悟与爱国热情着手，引导群众充分酝酿讨论，订出切合群众自己工作、生产、学习情况的爱国公约；而是采取强迫命令或包办代替的办法，因此订立的公约与群众不发生关系，当然也就无法执行。检查、修订爱国公约是克服这种偏向的有效办法。但像河北磁县北羊台村和湖南零陵城关区某些干部与积极分子曾采取过的那种办法，即使把爱国公约“修订”一千遍，爱国公约的形式主义仍然无法克服；相反的，会使群众感到修订爱国公约是一种负担。这种偏向应该予以彻底纠正。
