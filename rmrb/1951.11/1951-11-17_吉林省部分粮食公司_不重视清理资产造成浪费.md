Some Grain Companies in Jilin Province
Disregard Asset Clearance, Causing Waste
    Some grain companies in Jilin Province do not pay enough attention to asset clearance, resulting in waste. In mid-September, grain companies across the province launched an asset inventory campaign. In one month, the Gongzhuling and Dehui companies alone inventoried over 20,000 sacks, over 10,000 reed mats, over 20,000 grass sacks, and over 20,000 bundles of sorghum stalks, with a total value of more than 550 million yuan. In addition, many oil drums, oil tanks, etc. were also found. However, some leading cadres do not pay enough attention to this work and do not conduct careful inventory. Some companies deliberately downgrade assets. For example, the Nong'an Grain Station calculated new items as old items and usable sacks as waste products. In the asset inventory process at the Changchun Tiebei Warehouse, the Jiaohe Grain Station, and the Shulan Xiaochengzi Grain Station, there were instances of treating good assets as bad assets and new items as old items. At the same time, the implementation of various systems is also insufficient. The Nong'an Grain Station blindly recorded accounts without vouchers; the storekeeper of the Longjing Grain Station lent out oil tanks at will. Some companies do not pay attention to safekeeping after the inventory is completed. For example, the tarpaulins and sacks inventoried by the Jiaohe Grain Station were randomly discarded, and the mats were thrown into ditches and damaged by soaking.

　　吉林省部分粮食公司
    不重视清理资产造成浪费
    吉林省部分粮食公司，不重视清理资产，造成浪费现象。该省各地粮食公司，于九月中旬开展了清点资产运动，一个月来，仅公主岭、德惠两个公司即清点出麻袋两万多条，苇席一万余领，草袋两万多条，秫秸两万多领，总值达五亿五千多万元。此外，还查出很多油桶、油箱等。但部分领导干部对这一工作不够重视，没有认真清点。有的公司故意压低资产等级。如农安粮栈把新物品算成旧物品，把能用的麻袋算成废品。长春铁北仓库、蛟河粮栈、舒兰小城子粮栈在清点资产中，都曾有把好的资产当成坏的、把新的物品当成旧的现象。同时，各种制度的贯彻也很不够。农安粮栈没有传票，盲目记账；龙井粮栈保管员随便向外借油箱。有的公司清点完了却不注意保管。如蛟河粮栈清点过的苫布、麻袋等，随便乱扔，把席子扔到水沟里泡坏了。（本报综合）
