    Loyal to the Revolution, Daring to Make Revolution, Good at Making Revolution
    Loyalty to the revolution is, most fundamentally, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee of revolutionary victory. Without Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary cause will suffer failure.
    I became the County Party Secretary in September 1965. At first, I felt I lacked experience and was afraid of doing a bad job and being criticized. The other members of the County Party Committee were mostly veteran comrades, some of whom were my former leaders, and I was afraid of damaging relationships. After a period of practical work, I deeply realized that as long as I maintain the attitude of willingly being a primary school student, humbly learning from veteran comrades, consulting together on matters, and making collective decisions, the work can be done well.
    In the new year, I am determined to strictly demand of myself to be loyal to the revolution, daring to make revolution, and good at making revolution, so as to adapt to the new revolutionary situation. To be loyal to the revolution, the most fundamental thing is to be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform my non-proletarian thinking. Without Mao Zedong Thought, mistakes are inevitable, and failures will occur. Therefore, I must set an example, take the lead in studying, take the lead in delving into, and take the lead in applying Mao Zedong Thought. Lei Feng and Wang Jie lived for the revolution and died for the revolution. They are models of loyalty to the revolution and are examples for me to learn from. To dare to make revolution, one must have the spirit of continuous revolution. In order to complete the socialist revolution and construction, I must dare to be a revolutionary pioneer, dare to climb to the peaks, and dare to put in painstaking effort and fight hard battles. As long as one proceeds from the interests of the revolution and acts according to objective laws, has a spirit of daring to forge ahead, one can make achievements, gain experience, and find a path. Sticking to old ways, following conventions, and fearing hardship and difficulty are not the qualities of a revolutionary. In the past year, our county’s "vigorously developing water turbine pumps and developing the Miluo River" campaign established 127 water turbine pump stations along both banks of the river, taking a big step towards changing the face of Pingjiang. This event educated the vast number of cadres and masses, and also deeply educated myself. Under the new revolutionary situation, a true revolutionary must never remain at the leadership level of a small producer who "copies blindly." One must stand tall, see far, have a new vision in one's mind like Dazhai, and bravely shoulder the burdens entrusted by the Party and the people. I am a new cadre in a leading position and must humbly learn, especially from veteran comrades, so that I can be good at revolution in a relatively short period. How to start? Mainly to achieve the following three points: First, establish a firm policy viewpoint, and handle all work according to policies and according to Chairman Mao's instructions. When assigning work, first explain the policies; when handling problems, first ask about the policies; when checking work, first check the implementation of policies. Second, go deep into the grassroots to stay at selected points, and adhere to the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." One must personally use one's hands and mouth to grasp first-hand materials, and then use them to guide the work of the whole area. Third, establish the viewpoint of collective leadership. Implement collective decision-making on major issues, decentralized decision-making on minor issues, focus on the center, and comprehensive arrangements. On all major issues, fully promote democracy, humbly listen to opinions from all sides, especially respect the opinions of veteran comrades, and insist on making decisions on the basis of unified thinking.

### 忠于革命  敢于革命  善于革命

    忠于革命  敢于革命  善于革命
    忠于革命，最根本的是忠于毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是革命胜利的保证，离开了毛泽东思想，革命事业就要遭受失败
    我是一九六五年九月担任县委书记的，开始感到经验不足，怕搞不好工作受批评；县委的其他成员大都是老同志，有的是我的老领导，怕搞不好关系。经过一段工作实践，深深地体会到，只要抱上甘当小学生的态度，虚心向老同志学习，遇事共同商量，集体决定，工作是能够做好的。
    在新的一年里，我决心严格要求自己，忠于革命，敢于革命，善于革命，以适应新的革命形势。忠于革命最根本的是忠于毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想改造自己的非无产阶级思想。离开毛泽东思想，必然犯错误，遭失败。因此，我要以身作则，带头学，带头钻，带头用，一定要把毛泽东思想学到手。雷锋、王杰为革命而生，为革命而死，是忠于革命的典范，是我学习的榜样。要敢于革命，要有不断革命的精神。为了完成社会主义革命和建设事业，我要敢于当革命闯将，敢于攀登高峰，敢于下笨功夫，打硬仗。只要从革命的利益出发，根据客观规律办事，有个闯劲，就能闯出成绩来，就能闯出经验来，就能闯出道路来。故步自封，墨守成规，怕苦怕难，不是一个革命者。过去一年，我县“大搞水轮泵，开发汨罗江”的活动，在沿河两岸建立水轮泵站一百二十七处，为改变平江面貌跨了一大步。这件事，教育了广大干部群众，也深深教育了自己。在新的革命形势下，真正的革命者决不能停留在“依样画葫芦”小生产者的领导水平上，必须站得高，看得远，象大寨那样，脑子里有个新套套，勇敢地把党和人民交给的担子承担起来。我是个新到领导岗位的干部，一定要虚心学习，特别是向老同志学习，使自己在较短的时期内做到善于革命。怎样着手？主要做到以下三条：一是树立坚强的政策观点，一切工作按政策办事，按毛主席的指示办事。布置工作时，先交代政策；处理问题时，先问问政策；检查工作时，先检查政策执行情况。二是深入基层蹲点，坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”。要亲自动手、动口，掌握第一手材料，从而去指导面的工作。三是树立集体领导的观点。实行大权集体，小权分散，中心突出，全面安排。一切重大问题，充分发扬民主，虚心地听取各方面的意见，特别是要尊重老同志的意见，坚持在统一思想的基础上作出决定。
