    Two Worldviews
    In early November last year, this newspaper, taking advantage of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's convening of an enlarged provincial party committee meeting, invited county party secretaries from eighteen counties in Jiangxi Province, including Shanggao, Yichun, Nanchang, Anyi, Xinjian, Yujiang, Guangfeng, Boyang, Nancheng, Anfu, Taihe, Chongren, Ruijin, Quannan, Longnan, Xingguo, Jiujiang, and Ruichang, to discuss the issue of revolutionary leadership in county party committees. At the meeting, everyone, based on their own practices, focused on discussing some of the problems existing in the guiding ideology and mental state of the county party committees, the root causes of these problems, and the consequences that occurred in their work. The following is a summary:
  
  Getting By and Not Getting By
    Where does the mentality of passively seeking stability come from? Everyone talked about how this is often inseparable from a short-sighted, undemanding, complacent, and conservative state of mind; on the other hand, there is also the word "fear." Comrades from Shanggao, Boyang, Nancheng, and other counties all mentioned that in recent years (since 1958) they have achieved stable increases in production year after year, which was originally a good thing. However, they unconsciously became arrogant because of their success, lax because of their arrogance, and slow in their development because of their laxity. They were afraid of taking risks in their work and focused on seeking "stability." They were satisfied with annual increases in production, satisfied with the annual completion of national procurement tasks, satisfied with the fact that the masses' lives could "get by"... In a word, they did not demand high standards of themselves, nor did they demand of themselves the needs of the revolution and the needs of the country. In their work, they only demanded to "get by." This is the ideological root of the one-sided pursuit of "stability."

    Of course, we should not unconditionally oppose the idea of seeking stability. Stability, if it means making full preparations and not fighting battles without assurance of victory; doing in-depth investigation and research work, acting according to objective laws, and not wavering from side to side; it is about advancing boldly and placing the pace of progress on a solid and reliable foundation; this is stability in revolutionization, stability in active offense, and the realistic and practical style consistently advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong. The work of Yujiang County is like this. Since 1951, this county has been building water conservancy projects for fifteen years as if it were one day. After the basic water conservancy problems were solved, it focused on grasping the reforms of fertilizer, seeds, and cultivation systems, and steadfastly and unremittingly did a lot of work to change the conditions of production. In 1965, the total grain output exceeded 1957 by 70 percent, and increased by more than two times compared with the early days of liberation. Such stability is active stability, stability in offense, and seeking stability in speed. And the "stability" in some places is the "stability" of largely maintaining the status quo and not seeking major changes.

    The same word "stability" essentially reflects two different ideas. There is obviously a question of worldview here. Is it like the Yujiang County Party Committee, striving to transform the objective world as proletarian revolutionaries? Or is it to be an incompetent person who does nothing and maintains the status quo? Many county party committee comrades talked about how raising the idea of one-sidedly seeking stability to the height of worldview seems a bit difficult to accept at first glance. However, upon careful and deep excavation, behind this idea of fearing risks and focusing on seeking "stability," there is often a hidden "I," and it is often inseparable from personal gains and losses. This is incompatible with the fearless thinking of thorough materialists.

    In addition to the question of worldview, there is also the question of ideological method. Many county party committees mentioned that the idea of passively seeking stability often stems from the short-sightedness of small producers. They cannot see the great superiority of the people's communes, the huge enthusiasm for collective production hidden in the masses of the people, the changes in the national situation, and the extremely favorable conditions created by the basic farmland construction that has been widely carried out in various places in recent years and the growth of the national industrial strength for the leap forward development of agricultural production. They still blindly act according to old experiences and old standards, and they think that they are "in line with reality" even though they are treading on the spot!
            
            Different Thinking, Different Results
    The contradiction has been revealed so unequivocally. How to solve it? Some county party committees mentioned that as long as you really go to the masses, conduct serious investigations and research, and truly understand the needs of the masses, your thinking will not be stable and must change. As long as the leadership's thinking changes completely and resolutely attacks, production will have immediate results.

    Stability and change are two mutually opposed ideas. Comrades from Shanggao County mentioned that after 1958, production in Shanggao County basically increased steadily, and the accumulated amount of increase in recent years ranked first in the entire special district, but the speed of development in recent years can only be considered at the middle level. The main idea is the existence of the word "stability." Development is slow because of stability. More thought is given to recuperation and less thought is given to changing the face of nature. With a change in thinking and a broadened horizon, they found water sources in places where they originally thought there was nowhere to build reservoirs after mobilizing the masses, eliminating water conservancy dead ends that had not been resolved for several years.

    Only thinking of "stability" will lead to complacency with achievements, experiences cannot be summarized, fresh things in the masses cannot be seen, and if they are seen, they cannot be promoted, and if they are promoted, they cannot be popularized. Unconsciously, one's vision becomes dull, one's mind becomes closed, and one's hands and feet become lazy. Just like eliminating paddy fields, the Shanggao County Party Committee argued for several years, dragged on for several years, and ultimately failed to solve the problem. A reservoir in Yichun was studied and discussed for five years, but could not be built. The Feijianwan Reservoir was built in 1958, but has never been completed, and has never benefited anyone. If you always think of change, you will have sharp eyes, an open mind, and diligent hands and feet, and you will do what you say. Last spring, Shanggao County eliminated more than 70,000 mu of paddy fields, and early rice production increased by 30 percent. The reservoir in Yichun County that had been dragging on for five years was completed in one winter the year before last. The supporting works of the Feijianwan Reservoir can also be completed this winter and next spring, which can at least expand the irrigation area by 30,000 mu.

    The relationship between offense and defense is also like this. If you take offense as the main thing in your thinking, being active and proactive, good years can rise quickly, and bad years can be maintained. If you are based on defense, you will not only be passive, but also difficult to maintain the status quo. Taihe County is located on both sides of the Ganjiang River and is prone to disasters. In the past few years, the county party committee did not establish the idea of "being based on disaster, preparing with both hands, and taking offense as the main thing." In 1961 and 1962, there were two consecutive years of major floods, and the output went down. The county party committee suffered and learned lessons, changed its thinking and style of work, personally went down to stay at selected points, participated in labor, engaged in experimental fields, and adopted an offensive attitude. In 1963, there was a severe drought, which was more harmful than water. However, because the leadership had prepared their thinking and took various measures to resist disasters and increase production, production still increased this year. In 1964, there was another flood, which was the highest recorded in more than 60 years. The cadres and masses of the entire county, with one heart and one mind, withstood the disaster. The grain output this year also broke historical records. A great harvest in a year of great disaster. In the three-year comparison, the lessons are profound.

    Starting a business and keeping a business. Many county party committee comrades talked about how, with the socialist idea of starting a business and lofty ideals, they will stand high and see far in their work, have a strategic plan for the entire county's work, be far-sighted and down-to-earth, change the face of nature, and organize one battle after another. The work of Yujiang County is like this. The county party committee, with a strong desire to completely change the face of Yujiang, has been grasping the three major revolutions together since liberation, doing many "stupid" things in a down-to-earth manner, and solving the problems of drought and schistosomiasis that the masses urgently need to solve. The entire county has realized water conservancy and improved the red soil, making a low-yield county with less than 200 jin per mu leap to a high-yield county with 805 jin per mu. If you are just keeping the stall, only grasping the current year in your work, and have no long-term plan, you will inevitably be passive and the same as every year. Some county party committee comrades talked about this lesson and felt deeply distressed.

    After solving a series of understanding problems of stability and change, offense and defense, starting a business and keeping a business, what does it take to change the face of production within the scope of a county? Relying on self-reliance or relying on national support? Many county party committees mentioned that they talk about self-reliance in words, but they always want to ask the state for more money and more materials in their minds, thinking that more money is easier to do things. What is the result? Comrades from Xingguo County, the old revolutionary base area, talked about how, because Xingguo is an old base area, there are many relief funds and many state loans. In the past few years, the county party committee had more or less the idea of relying on state loans, but it did not solve the construction problems of Xingguo. Many water conservancy facilities have been in an "eight-year 'war of resistance' and have not yet benefited." As a result, the county's production has developed slowly, its contribution to the country is small, and the masses' income is low. Last year, the county party committee established the idea of ​​carrying forward the revolutionary tradition, hard work, and self-reliance, and focused on grasping several measures to increase production, such as improved varieties, pest control, and large-scale planting of red flower grass (only more than 10,000 mu were planted the year before last, and 130,000 mu were planted last year), especially through the socialist education movement, the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses in the old base area was mobilized. Last year, grain output increased by 20 percent compared with the year before last, exceeding the highest annual output by more than 10 percent. (Compiled by Jin Feng)

    两种世界观
    去年十一月初，本报就江西省委召开省委扩大会议之便，邀请江西省上高、宜春、南昌、安义、新建、余江、广丰、波阳、南城、安福、泰和、崇仁、瑞金、全南、龙南、兴国、九江、瑞昌等十八个县的县委书记，座谈县委领导革命化的问题。会上，大家根据自己的实践，着重谈了县委指导思想和精神状态方面存在的一些问题，产生这些问题的根源及其在工作中发生的后果。现在摘要综述如下：
  过得去和过不去
    消极求稳思想从那里来？大家谈到，这常常和目光短浅、要求不高、骄傲自满、故步自封的精神状态分不开；另一方面还有个“怕”字。上高、波阳、南城等县的同志都谈到这几年（从一九五八年以后）连年稳定增产，这本来是件好事。但他们不知不觉因胜而骄、因骄而松、因松而发展缓慢，工作中怕冒风险，一意求“稳”起来。满足于年年增产，满足于国家征购任务年年完成，满足于群众生活可以“过得去”……一句话，不以高标准要求自己，不以革命的需要和国家的需要来要求自己，工作中只要求“过得去”，这便是片面求“稳”的思想根源。
    当然，我们不应当无条件的反对求稳思想。稳，如果是指要做好充分准备，不打无把握之仗；是做好深入的调查研究工作，根据客观规律办事，不左右摇摆，是锐意前进，把前进的脚步放在坚实可靠的基础上；这是革命化中的稳，是积极进攻中的稳，是毛泽东同志一贯提倡的实事求是的作风。余江县的工作便是这样。这个县从一九五一年起，十五年如一日地兴修水利，水利基本解决以后又大抓肥料、种子和耕作制度的改革，踏踏实实，坚韧不拔地作了许多改变生产条件的工作。一九六五年粮食总产量超过一九五七年的百分之七十，比解放初期增加两倍多。这样的稳是积极的稳，是进攻中的稳，是快中求稳。而有些地方的“稳”，则是大体维持现状、不求大的变革的“稳”。
    同样一个稳字，实质上反映着两种不同的思想。这里显然有个世界观的问题。是象余江县委那样当无产阶级的革命家，力求改造客观世界呢？还是当无所作为的庸人，维持现状呢？许多县委同志谈到，把片面求稳的思想提高到世界观的高度，乍一看似乎有点难以接受。但是，仔细深挖一下，这种怕冒风险、一意求“稳”的思想后面，往往隐藏着一个“我”字，往往与个人得失利害的打算分不开。这和彻底的唯物主义者的无所畏惧的思想是不相容的。
    除了世界观的问题以外，也还有个思想方法的问题。不少县委谈到，消极求稳的思想，常常出于小生产者的近视眼。他们看不到人民公社的极大优越性，看不到人民群众中蕴藏着巨大的集体生产的积极性，看不到全国形势的变化，看不到几年来各地普遍进行的农田基本建设和国家工业力量的壮大，为农业生产的飞跃发展创造的极为有利的条件。他们还一味根据老经验、老水平办事，本来是脚踏原地，还自以为是“合乎实际”哩！
            思想不同结果不同
    矛盾是这样毫不含糊地揭发出来了。如何解决？有些县委谈到，只要真正到群众中去，认真调查研究，切实了解群众的需要，思想上就稳不住，非变不可。只要领导思想彻底地变，坚决进攻，生产上就会立竿见影。
    稳和变是两种互相对立的思想。上高县的同志谈到，上高县在一九五八年以后，生产基本上是稳步上升，几年来增产的积累数，在全专区占第一位，但近几年来发展的速度，只算得中等水平。主要思想存在一个稳字。因稳而发展缓慢。休养生息想得多了，改变自然面貌想得少了。思想一变，眼界开阔，原来认为无处可修水库的地方，发动群众以后，找到了水源，消灭了几年没解决的水利死角。
    只想到“稳”，就会满足于已得成就，经验总结不起来，群众中新鲜东西看不见，看见了提不高，提高了推不广。不知不觉，眼光迟钝，心胸闭塞，手脚变懒。就象消灭过水田，上高县委吵了好几年，拖了好几年，终未解决。宜春的一个水库，研究讨论了五年，修不起来。飞剑湾水库，一九五八年修起，一直没有配套，一直没有受益。常想到变，就会目光犀利，心胸开阔，手脚变勤，说干就干。去年一个春季，上高县消灭过水田七万多亩，早稻增产百分之三十。宜春县那个拖了五年的水库，前年一个冬季干成了。飞剑湾水库的配套工程，去冬今春也能完工，至少能扩大灌溉面积三万亩。
    攻和守的关系也是这样。思想上以攻为主，积极主动，好年景才能上得快，坏年景才能保得住。立足于守，不仅被动，现状也难保。泰和县地处赣江两岸，容易受灾。前几年县委没有树立“立足于灾，两手准备，以攻为主”的思想，一九六一年、一九六二年连续两年大水，产量就下去了。县委吃了苦头，总结教训，转变思想作风，亲自下去蹲点，参加劳动，搞试验田，采取了进攻的态度。一九六三年大旱，比水的危害性更大。但因领导思想有了准备，采取各种抗灾增产的措施，这一年还增了产。一九六四年又发洪水，是六十多年没有的纪录。全县干部群众，同心合力，顶住了灾害。这一年的粮食产量也打破了历史纪录。大灾之年大丰收。三年对比，教训深刻。
    创业和守业。不少县委同志谈到，有了社会主义的创业思想和远大理想，工作上就会站得高，看得远，对于全县工作有个战略部署，就会高瞻远瞩而又脚踏实地，改变自然面貌，组织一个又一个的战役。余江县的工作正是这样。县委怀着一定要彻底改变余江面貌的强烈愿望，从解放到现在，县委一直是三大革命一起抓，踏踏实实，做了许多“笨”工作，解决了群众迫切需要解决的消灭旱灾和血吸虫的问题，全县实现了水利化，改善了红壤土，使一个亩产不到二百斤的低产县，一跃而为亩产八百零五斤的高产县。如果只是守摊子，工作上只抓当年，没有长远打算，势必年年被动，年年老样子。有的县委同志谈到这一教训，深感痛心。
    解决了稳和变、攻和守、创业和守业这一系列的认识问题之后，在一个县的范围内改变生产面貌靠什么？靠自力更生，还是依赖国家支援？不少县委谈到，口头上讲自力更生，思想上总想向国家多要些钱，多要些物资，认为钱多好办事。结果怎样呢？革命老根据地的兴国县的同志谈到，因为兴国是老根据地，救济款多，国家贷款也不少。前几年县委多多少少有依赖国家贷款的思想，结果并没有解决兴国的建设问题。好多水利设施是“八年‘抗战’，还未受益”。结果，全县生产发展慢，对国家贡献小，群众收入低。去年，县委确立了发扬革命传统、艰苦奋斗、自力更生的思想，狠抓了几项增产措施，例如良种、灭虫和大种红花草（前年只种一万多亩，去年种了十三万亩）等，特别是通过社会主义教育运动，调动了老根据地革命群众的积极性，去年粮食产量比前年增加百分之二十，超过最高年产量的百分之十以上。（金凤整理）
