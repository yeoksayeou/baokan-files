    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang - Shenyang Huaguang Bulb Factory has recently manufactured a new type of signal light for use in railway stations: the tungsten iodide lamp.
    In the past, the signal lights used on China's railways were all incandescent lamps, and the projection distance of the signal was only over one thousand meters. Drivers, fearing they would not be able to see the signal clearly, would reduce the train's speed far from the station. The new signal light has a projection distance of up to two thousand six hundred meters. It creates favorable conditions for accelerating train speed and ensuring safe transportation. Compared with incandescent lamps, this signal light can also save about 50% of electricity.
    Recently, relevant units such as the Shenyang Railway Bureau and the China Academy of Railway Sciences have appraised this signal light and believe that its performance is good and that it can be put into mass production.

    投射距离远的新信号灯
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳华光灯泡厂新近制成一种铁路车站使用的新型信号灯——碘钨灯。
    过去我国铁路使用的信号灯都是白炽灯，信号的投射距离只有一千多米，司机怕看不清信号，离车站老远就降低列车的行驶速度。新型信号灯的投射距离远达二千六百米。它为加快列车行驶速度和安全运输创造了有利的条件。这种信号灯同白炽灯相比，还能节约百分之五十左右的电力。
    最近，沈阳铁路局、铁道科学研究院等有关单位，对这种信号灯作了鉴定，认为性能良好，可以成批投入生产。
