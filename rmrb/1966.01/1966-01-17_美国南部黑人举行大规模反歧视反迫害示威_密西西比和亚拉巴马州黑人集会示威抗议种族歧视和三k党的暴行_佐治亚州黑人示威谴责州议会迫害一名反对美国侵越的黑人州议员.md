    Black People in Mississippi and Alabama Hold Rallies and Demonstrations to Protest Racial Discrimination and the Atrocities of the Ku Klux Klan
    Black People in Georgia Demonstrate to Condemn the State Legislature's Persecution of a Black State Representative Who Opposed US Aggression Against Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th January, New York Dispatch: One thousand black and white people in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, held a demonstration and rally on the 15th to protest the Ku Klux Klan's murder of Damer, a local black leader, on the 10th.
    Following Damer's brutal murder, black people in Hattiesburg held demonstrations for five consecutive days and filed protests with the authorities, demanding that the murderers be punished. However, the authorities neither punished the murderers nor paid attention to the black people's protests.
    On the 15th, the demonstrators first marched from a church to the downtown area, chanting slogans and singing songs along the way, their emotions very high. The police brutally interfered with the demonstrators, and one demonstrator was arrested. This further aroused the anger of the demonstrators. They held a protest rally in front of the courthouse. Local black leaders emphasized in their speeches that black people were no longer afraid of the Ku Klux Klan's persecution and that they would carry the struggle for their rights through to the end.
    On the same day, in Tuskegee, Alabama, about six hundred black students marched in the downtown area to protest the police and racists beating about thirty black people who were demonstrating against racial discrimination earlier that day.
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th January, New York Dispatch: One thousand five hundred black and white people in Atlanta, Georgia, held a demonstration for about two hours on the 14th to protest the state legislature's persecution of a black state representative who expressed opposition to US aggression against Vietnam.
    The demonstrators marched towards the state legislature from two different locations. A large number of mounted police blocked the road to the legislature. About one hundred demonstrators, ignoring the police's threats, rushed up the steps to the entrance of the legislature holding placards. The police used force to push them down. The demonstrators held a protest rally outside the legislature.
    On the same day, in Birmingham, Alabama, another three hundred and fifty black youths marched in the downtown area to protest the government authorities' implementation of racial discrimination in elections. Black people in Birmingham have been carrying out demonstrations against racial discrimination for more than twenty days. (Photo attached)

    密西西比和亚拉巴马州黑人集会示威抗议种族歧视和三K党的暴行
    佐治亚州黑人示威谴责州议会迫害一名反对美国侵越的黑人州议员
    新华社十六日讯　纽约消息：美国密西西比州哈提斯堡一千名黑人和白人十五日举行示威游行和集会，抗议三K党在十日杀害当地的一位黑人领袖达默。
    在达默惨遭杀害以后，哈提斯堡的黑人一连五天举行了示威，并向当局提出抗议，要求惩办凶手。但是，当局既不惩办凶手，也不理睬黑人的抗议。
    十五日，示威群众首先从一座教堂向闹市区进发，他们一路上高呼口号和唱歌，情绪非常激昂。警察对示威群众进行了横蛮的干涉，一名示威者被逮捕。这更加激起了示威群众的愤怒。他们在法院门前举行了抗议集会。当地黑人领袖在会上讲话时强调指出，黑人不再害怕三K党的迫害，他们一定要把争取自身权利的斗争进行到底。
    同一天，在亚拉巴马州杜斯克基市，约六百名黑人学生在闹市区游行，抗议警察和种族主义分子在当天早些时候殴打约三十名进行示威反对种族歧视的黑人。
    新华社十五日讯　纽约消息：美国佐治亚州亚特兰大市一千五百名黑人和白人十四日举行了约两小时的示威，抗议州议会对一名表示反对美国侵略越南的黑人州议员进行迫害。
    示威群众分别从两个地点出发，向州议会进军。大批骑警挡住了通向议会的道路。约一百名示威者不顾警察的威胁，举着标语牌冲上议会门口的台阶。警察用武力把他们推下去。示威者在议会外面举行了抗议集会。
    同一天，在亚拉巴马州伯明翰市，又有三百五十多名黑人青年在闹市区游行，抗议政府当局在选举方面实行种族歧视。二十多天以来伯明翰黑人一直在进行反对种族歧视的示威活动。（附图片）
