    Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from Canberra: U.S. President Johnson's "peace envoy," Harriman, nearing the end of his mission of peddling the "peace talks" hoax throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, revealed his ferocious nature and clamored that the U.S. will never "retreat" from South Vietnam. He also brandished blackmail, threatening the Vietnamese people with the resumption of bombing.

    Harriman held a press conference in Canberra, the capital of Australia, on the 11th. At the conference, a reporter asked him if there were any changes in the U.S. policy towards Vietnam. Harriman replied, "No, quite the contrary," the U.S. will not "retreat" from South Vietnam. Harriman reiterated at the conference that U.S. President Johnson is determined to prevent South Vietnam from being subjected to so-called "armed conquest." He then spoke with a tone of blackmail: "There is no obligation (on the U.S.) as to how long the current suspension of bombing will last, or how quickly such bombing will be resumed. President Johnson suspended the bombing to give Hanoi an opportunity to come to the negotiating table."

    On the other hand, Harriman dangled the carrot of the U.S.'s so-called "Southeast Asia development plan," shamelessly saying that "if the fighting stops, North Vietnam will be welcomed to participate in a regional aid program that the U.S. is prepared to provide at least one billion dollars for."

    According to Agence France-Presse, in discussing Johnson's latest "peace offensive," he expressed that he "is satisfied with this: the Soviet Union hopes to achieve peace in Vietnam and is in favor of eventually holding a meeting (on this matter)." United Press International also reported that Harriman recalled at this press conference that when he was in Moscow last July, he "clearly saw that the Russians wanted to see the end of the Vietnam War" because "they do not gain anything from this war."

    Harriman expressed the hope that "as many countries as possible" would provide cannon fodder for the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, particularly expressing the need to firmly tie Australia to the U.S. war chariot. He said: "While the war is still going on, I cannot imagine any possibility of Australia withdrawing from Vietnam." Prior to this, Australian newspapers had widely reported that Harriman had asked the Menzies government to provide more cannon fodder for the U.S. aggression against Vietnam.

    Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from Saigon: U.S. Marine Corps Commander Greene blatantly stated in Saigon on the 11th that the U.S. military will remain in South Vietnam for the long term. He also indicated that if the "peace talks" hoax fails, the war of aggression against Vietnam will be expanded.

    Greene left Saigon on the 11th to return to Washington after a four-day visit to South Vietnam.

    According to United Press International, when asked by reporters at Tan Son Nhut Airport near Saigon how long the U.S. military would stay in South Vietnam, he said: "To help them (the South Vietnamese puppets), we are prepared to stay as long as necessary." He also said: If the Communists choose armed confrontation and reject the U.S.'s proposed negotiation suggestion in the current "peace offensive", the remainder of his 223,000 U.S. Marines are prepared to land in South Vietnam.

    At a press conference at the end of his activities in Da Nang on the 9th, Greene said that he could say with certainty that more helicopters would be sent to South Vietnam to support the ground operations of the U.S. Marine Corps and South Vietnam.

    During his visit to South Vietnam, Greene held consultations with senior commanders of the U.S. and puppet troops, and "inspected" military facilities.

    美国“和平”特使戳穿美国“和平”把戏
    哈里曼叫嚷美国侵越政策没有任何改变
    美海军陆战队司令也说美国要长期赖在南越
    新华社十二日讯　堪培拉消息：美国总统约翰逊的“和平特使”哈里曼在他周游欧、亚、非、澳四大洲兜售“和谈”大骗局的使命临近结束时，凶相毕露地叫嚷说，美国决不从南越“后退”。他还大耍讹诈手段，以恢复轰炸来威胁越南人民。
    哈里曼十一日在澳大利亚首都堪培拉举行了记者招待会。会上，有记者问他，美国对越南的政策是否有任何改变，哈里曼回答说，“没有，恰恰相反”，美国将不从南越“后退”。哈里曼在会上重申，美国总统约翰逊决心坚持要防止南越遭到所谓“武力征服”。他接着用讹诈的口吻说：“对于目前的暂停轰炸将持续多久，或者有多快就要恢复这种轰炸，（美国）并没有承担义务。约翰逊总统暂停轰炸的目的是给河内一个走到谈判桌旁来的机会。”
    另方面哈里曼又摇晃美国所谓“开发东南亚计划”的胡萝卜，厚颜无耻地说什么“如果战斗停止了，将会欢迎北越参加一项美国准备至少提供十亿美元的地区性援助计划”。
    据法新社报道，他在谈到约翰逊的这次“和平攻势”时表示，他“对这一点感到满意：苏联希望在越南实现和平，并且赞成最终（就此）举行会议”。合众国际社也报道说，哈里曼在这次记者招待会上还追述说，他去年七月在莫斯科时，就“清楚地看到，俄国人希望看到越南战争结束”，因为，“他们从这场战争中得不到任何好处”。
    哈里曼表示希望“尽可能多的国家”为美国侵略越南提供炮灰，特别表示要把澳大利亚紧紧地缚在美国的战车上。他说：“在战争还在继续的时候，我不能想象澳大利亚有任何可能撤出越南。”在这以前，澳大利亚报纸曾经广泛报道，哈里曼要求孟席斯政府为美国侵略越南提供更多的炮灰。
    新华社十二日讯　西贡消息：美国海军陆战队司令格林十一日在西贡公然表示美军要长期赖在南越不走。他还表示如果“和谈”骗局失败就要扩大侵越战争。
    格林在南越活动四天后，十一日离开西贡回华盛顿。
  据合众国际社报道，他在西贡附近的新山一机场回答记者提出的美军将在南越呆多久的问题时说：“为了帮助他们（南越傀儡），我们准备有必要呆多久就呆多久。”他还说：如果共产党人选择武力较量而拒绝美国在当前的“和平攻势”中提出的谈判建议的话，他的二十二万三千名美国海军陆战队的其余的部队就准备在南越登陆。
    格林九日在岘港活动结束时，曾在记者招待会上说，他可以肯定地说，将增派直升飞机到南越，以支持美国海军陆战队和南越的地面行动。
    格林在南越活动期间同美、伪军高级司令进行了磋商，并且“视察”了军事设施。
