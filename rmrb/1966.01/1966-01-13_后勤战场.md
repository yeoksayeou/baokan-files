    Logistics battlefield
    The junk collector's pole, carried on the shoulders,
    The recycling truck, reflected in the rising sun!
    We must make the collected scraps, - shine anew!
    Order the lagging waste parts, - to catch up at a run!
    Quick! Cast scrap iron into pure steel,
    And let it be pressed into the soldier's gun barrel;
    Quick! Throw old nails into the furnace,
    And let it be screwed onto brand new machine tools!
    For the front lines, transport "guns," transport "cannons"!
    For the revolution, generate heat, generate light!
    Here are the winds and waves of the four seas and five continents;
    Here is the logistics battlefield of the three great revolutions!
    Look at our glorious waste and used materials workers,
    Day and night—riveting beams for the communist mansion!

    后勤战场
    艺兵废品担，挑在双肩上，收购车，映照着初升朝阳！要让收购的破烂，——重新闪光！喝令掉队的废件，——跑步追上！快！把废铁铸成纯钢，让它压进战士的枪膛；快！把旧钉投进熔炉，让它拧上崭新的机床！为火线，运“枪”，运“炮”！为革命，发热，发光！这里有四海云水五洲风浪；这里是三大革命后勤战场！看我们光荣的废旧物资工人，日日夜夜——为共产主义大厦铆钉架梁！
