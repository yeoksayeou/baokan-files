    A Brief Discussion on New Year Pictures with Children as Subject Matter
    Guo Jun
    Children are an important readership for New Year pictures. To create good New Year pictures with children as the subject matter is an important task in conducting ideological education for children.
    The children-themed New Year pictures exhibited this time have new developments and improvements. The children's images in the paintings are no longer the chubby babies with feudal colors, but the robust, growing red successors with noble qualities and love for the collective, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. These paintings have eliminated the old aesthetic views in old New Year pictures. Those paintings that simply use children as entertainment have also disappeared. Instead, they focus on real life, presenting the most meaningful things in children's lives. These paintings reflect how they learn from heroes such as Lei Feng and Wang Jie. These paintings also pay attention to the aesthetic habits of the peasants, boldly applying folk forms while innovating them, so the forms also feel fresh.

    略谈儿童题材的年画
    郭钧
    儿童是年画的重要读者对象，把儿童题材的年画画好，这是对儿童进行思想教育的重要任务。
    这次展出的儿童题材年画，有着新的发展和改进。画中的儿童形象，再不是那些具有封建色彩的胖娃娃了，而是在毛泽东思想抚育下健壮的成长、具有崇高的品质、热爱集体的红色接班人。这些画，清除了旧年画中旧的审美观。那些单纯以儿童题材来作为娱乐的画幅也绝迹了。而是着重从生活出发，将儿童们生活中最有意义的事表现出来。这些画反映他们怎样学习雷锋、王杰等英雄人物。这些画也很注意农民的欣赏习惯，大胆的运用民间形式而又加以革新，因此形式上也感到新鲜。
