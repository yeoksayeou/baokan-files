    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 29th: Leaders of some Japanese political parties and democratic organizations have strongly criticized the anti-people policy speech delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Sato in the Diet on the 28th.

    Kawakami Kanichi, head of the Japanese Communist Party Diet members group, said that Sato's policy speech on the 28th was "an extremely anti-people speech and a serious challenge to democratic forces." In this speech, Sato openly supported the "peace offensive" played by the United States to expand its war of aggression in Vietnam, praised the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," supported the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique in Taiwan, and was hostile to China.

    Kawakami Kanichi pointed out that Sato, under the pretext of "overcoming economic difficulties," issued deficit bonds and consciously adopted inflationary policies, the purpose of which was to revive militarism and maintain the interests of monopoly capital.

    Hori Makoto, Director-General of the Japan Peace Committee, said: Sato speaks well of the United States as if it truly desires peace, but this is to more actively support America's aggressive actions.

    Hori Makoto condemned Sato for defending the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," saying that Sato's talk of strengthening the Japan-U.S. "security system" is to protect Japan's security and peace is a complete reversal of black and white. The fact is that it is precisely because of the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" that Japan has become the largest base for the war of aggression against Vietnam. Sato's speech is an attempt to make Japan accelerate down the increasingly dangerous road of reviving militarism and waging a war of aggression.

    Yokomichi Setsuo, Chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council of the Socialist Party, said that Sato's emphasis on fulfilling the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" means that Japan will further assist the United States in its aggression against Vietnam.

    The *Akahata* newspaper pointed out in a report on the 29th that Sato's policy speech blatantly illustrated the Japanese government's policy of actively supporting the U.S. aggression in Asia under the guise of "promoting peaceful diplomacy," strengthening the "Japan-U.S. Security System," and further reviving the reactionary line of Japanese militarism and imperialism.

    The *Akahata* also pointed out that Sato, while praising "Japan-Soviet diplomacy" based on the "U.S.-Soviet cooperation" line, launched vicious attacks on China.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato's policy speech at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 28th shows that the Sato government stubbornly insists on its diplomatic line of following the United States, collaborating with the Soviet Union, and being hostile to China. Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina also reiterated this reactionary diplomatic line of the Sato government in his speech to the House of Representatives on the same day.

    Just as the "peace talks" fraud played by the United States is being strongly condemned by world public opinion and is facing bankruptcy, and the United States is actively preparing to further expand its war of aggression in Vietnam, Sato, in his speech, continued to praise "the United States has flexible ideas for resolving the (Vietnam) problem and is earnestly seeking peace." Sato also openly attacked the Vietnamese people for "not yet showing satisfactory signs" towards the US "peace talks" fraud, and demanded that "North Vietnam and other relevant countries not ignore this strong (demand for peace talks) world opinion," but to "quickly show a positive response" to America's "peace talks" fraud.

    Sato, in his speech, once again repeated the Japanese government's arguments of following the US imperialist policy of war and aggression, and reviving militarism. He tried his best to defend the "Japan-U.S. Security System," saying, "In the postwar world situation, a country cannot ensure its security by itself," "I believe that maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system is the most realistic policy to ensure the peace and security of our country." Shiina also stated in his speech that he "hopes and believes that the United States will do its utmost to defend Japan's obligations under the security treaty. At the same time, our country (Japan) must also earnestly fulfill its obligations stipulated by the treaty. Only in this way can we ensure our right to speak to the United States and play a positive role in resolving world problems."

    In this speech, Sato described Japan's collusion with the new Soviet leaders according to the wishes of the United States as Japan's implementation of "peaceful coexistence" with countries with different social systems, and used this to justify Japan's maintenance of the "Japan-U.S. Security System." He said, "Maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system is not to deny peaceful coexistence with countries of different ideologies and different political systems, nor is it to make peaceful coexistence impossible." "Recently, our country and the Soviet Union have accumulated neighborly relations in various fields" is proof of this. Shiina also revealed that he had contacted Soviet leaders in order to promote the US "peace talks" fraud, "hoping to use this as an opportunity to enhance the power of peaceful resolution."

    Sato expressed in his speech that he would continue to implement the reactionary policy of hostility towards China and continue to play the conspiracy of "two Chinas." He said, "The Japanese government intends to maintain friendly and amicable relations with the Republic of China as always," while "regarding Communist China," it "must see clearly where the country's interests lie and treat it cautiously." He even attacked China's firm stance against US imperialism as a "stubborn attitude."

    Sato revealed in his speech that Japan will continue to pursue a policy of expansion towards some Asian countries. He said that Japan will "cooperate" with and provide "assistance" to Asian countries "facing serious food and economic crises." Japan "actively participates in the establishment of the Asian Development Bank, and will also hold a Southeast Asia (countries) Development Ministerial Meeting in Tokyo in April, all of which are in accordance with this spirit."

### 日本民主力量领导人强烈谴责佐藤反动政策  佐藤发表施政演说坚持奉行追随美国联苏反华路线

    日本民主力量领导人强烈谴责佐藤反动政策
    佐藤发表施政演说坚持奉行追随美国联苏反华路线
    据新华社东京二十九日电  日本一些政党和民主团体的领导人，强烈抨击日本首相佐藤二十八日在国会上发表的反人民的施政演说。
    日本共产党国会议员团团长川上贯一说，佐藤二十八日的施政演说是“一次极端反人民的演说，是对民主力量的严重挑战”。佐藤在这次演说中公然支持美国为扩大侵略越南战争而玩弄的“和平攻势”，并且吹捧“日美安全条约”，支持台湾蒋介石傀儡集团，敌视中国。
    川上贯一指出，佐藤借口“克服经济困难”，发行赤字公债、有意识地采取通货膨胀政策，其目的是为了复活军国主义和维护垄断资本的利益。
    日本和平委员会理事长堀真琴说：佐藤把美国说得好象真正希望和平，这是为了更加积极地支持美国的侵略行动。
    堀真琴谴责佐藤为“日美安全条约”辩解，他说，佐藤说什么加强日美“安全体制”，是为了保卫日本的安全和和平，这是彻头彻尾的颠倒黑白。事实正是由于“日美安全条约”，才使日本变成了侵略越南战争最大的基地。佐藤的演说是企图使日本加速走上越来越危险的复活军国主义和进行侵略战争的道路。
    社会党政策审议会会长横路节雄说，佐藤强调履行“日美安全条约”，这就意味着日本要更加协助美国侵略越南。
    《赤旗报》二十九日在一篇报道中指出，佐藤的施政演说露骨地说明了日本政府在“推进和平外交”的招牌下，积极支持美国侵略亚洲的政策，加强“日美安全保障体制”，进一步复活日本军国主义、帝国主义的反动路线。
    《赤旗报》还指出，佐藤在赞扬以“美苏合作”路线为基础的“日苏外交”的同时，对中国进行了恶毒的攻击。
    新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日本首相佐藤荣作二十八日在众议院全体会议上发表的施政演说表明，佐藤政府顽固地坚持追随美国、联合苏联和敌视中国的外交路线。日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎同一天在众议院发表的演说中也重申了佐藤政府的这一反动外交路线。
    正当美国玩弄的“和谈”骗局受到世界舆论的强烈谴责而遭到破产、美国正在积极准备进一步扩大侵越战争的时候，佐藤在他的演说中却继续吹捧“美国对于解决（越南）问题抱有灵活的想法，并且认真的寻求着和平”。佐藤还公然攻击越南人民对美国的“和谈”骗局“还没有表现出令人满意的迹象”，并且要求“北越等有关国家不要不理睬这种强烈的（要求和平谈判的）世界舆论”，而要对美国的“和谈”骗局“迅速表示积极的反应”。
    佐藤在演说中再一次重复了日本政府追随美帝国主义的战争和侵略政策，复活军国主义的论调，他极力为“日美安全体制”辩解说，“在战后的世界形势下面，一个国家只靠自己不能确保安全”，“我认为，保持日美安全条约体制，是为了确保我国的和平和安全的最现实的政策”。椎名在他的演说中也谈到“希望并且确信美国将根据安全条约而竭尽保卫日本的义务。同时，我国（日本）也必须切实地履行条约规定的义务。这样才可以确保对美国的发言权并且在解决世界问题上起积极作用。”
    佐藤在这次演说中把日本按照美国的意旨同苏联新领导勾结，说成是日本同不同社会制度的国家实行“和平共处”，并且以此来为日本的保持“日美安全体制”进行辩解。他说，“保持日美安全条约体制，并不是要否定和不同意识形态和不同政治制度的国家的和平共处，也不是要使和平共处成为不可能”。“最近我国同苏联在各方面都积累了睦邻关系”就是证明。椎名也透露，他曾经为了推行美国的“和谈”骗局，同苏联领导人进行了接触，“希望以此为契机增强和平解决的力量”。
    佐藤在演说中表示继续执行敌视中国的反动政策，并且继续玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋。他说，“日本政府打算一如既往地同中华民国保持友好亲善关系”，“对共产党中国”，则“要看清国家的利益所在，慎重地对待”。他甚至攻击中国反对美帝国主义的坚决立场是“顽固的态度”。
    佐藤在演说中透露，日本将继续推行向亚洲的一些国家进行扩张的政策。他说，日本将同亚洲“面临严重的粮食危机和经济危机”的国家进行“合作”和给予“援助”。日本“主动地参加亚洲开发银行的建立，还要在四月在东京召开东南亚（国家）开发部长会议，这些都是根据这种精神的。”
