    Xinhua News Agency, 18th – Recently, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a circular, commending two units of the Beijing Military Region and a unit of the Air Force for their heroic actions in rescuing people's lives and property while fighting sea surges and extinguishing fires. The circular stated that the commanders and fighters of these units, fearing neither hardship nor death, stepped forward and fought bravely at the critical juncture when people's lives and property were threatened, proving themselves to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.
    The circular commended a unit of the Beijing Military Region that overcame a sea surge on November 7th of last year. On that day, an unprecedented sea surge in decades occurred in the Bohai Bay. Without waiting for orders from their superiors, the commanders and fighters quickly went onto the embankment and fought the sea surge together with the local people. After more than four hours of hard work, they finally protected the safety of the residents in the area.
    A unit of the Beijing Military Region also demonstrated the noble quality of the people's army loving the people when assisting the masses in putting out a fire. The circular stated that one morning in November of last year, a reed pond caught fire. The commanders and fighters, as if hearing gunfire on the battlefield, immediately rushed to the scene of the fire along with local cadres and commune members. After more than three hours of hard work, the fire was finally extinguished, preventing significant damage to 16,000 mu of reeds.
    The circular also described the moving deeds of more than 600 people from a unit of the Air Force and other units in extinguishing another fierce fire.
    The heroic actions of these commanders and fighters have won warm praise from the local Party and government leading organs and the people.
    The circular stated that these heroic actions once again prove that as long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on giving prominence to politics, and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to raise our class consciousness, our commanders and fighters will be able to fearlessly sacrifice themselves and face danger at critical junctures, creating countless inspiring heroic deeds for the interests of the country and the safety of the people's lives and property, and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the army loving the people.

    总政表扬北京部队、空军部队的三个单位
    战海啸灭火灾英勇抢救人民生命财产
    据新华社十八日讯　最近，中国人民解放军总政治部发出通报，表扬北京部队的两支部队和空军某部等三个单位，为抢救人民生命财产，在战海啸、灭火灾时表现出来的英雄行为。通报说，这些单位的指战员，一不怕苦，二不怕死，在人民生命财产受到威胁的紧要关头，挺身而出，英勇搏斗，不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    通报表扬了去年十一月七日战胜海啸的北京部队某部。那天，渤海湾出现几十年来罕见的大海啸，指战员们不等上级命令，迅速上堤，和当地群众一起与海啸搏斗。经过四个多小时的奋战，终于保护了驻地群众的安全。
    北京部队某部在协助人民群众扑灭一场火灾时，也表现了人民军队爱人民的高贵品质。通报介绍说，去年十一月的一个上午，某地芦苇塘失火，指战员们象战场上听到枪声一样，立即和当地干部、社员一起，奔赴失火地点。经过三个多小时奋战，烈火终于被扑灭了，一万六千亩芦苇免受重大损失。
    通报还介绍了空军某部等单位六百多人在扑灭另一次烈火中的动人事迹。
    这些指战员的英雄行为，获得了当地党、政府领导机关和人民群众的热烈赞扬。
    通报说，这些英勇行为再一次证明，只要高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚决贯彻林彪副主席突出政治的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，提高阶级觉悟，我们的指战员，就能在紧要关头不怕牺牲和危险，为国家的利益，为人民生命财产的安全，创造出无数的振奋人心的英雄事迹，使我军拥政爱民的光荣传统发扬光大。
