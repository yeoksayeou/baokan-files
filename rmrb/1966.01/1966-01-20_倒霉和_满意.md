Title: Bad Luck and "Satisfaction"

    Johnson talked to American reporters about his review of 1965. The Associated Press wrote on New Year's Day this year: "The president's greatest disappointment in 1965 was the setbacks he encountered in Vietnam. He was most satisfied with the progress made in civil rights."

    Johnson's expression of "greatest disappointment" with the U.S. situation in the war of aggression against Vietnam is, of course, not difficult to understand. But what exactly is the so-called "progress in civil rights" with which he is "most satisfied"?

    The U.S. Information Service published a special article on January 2 reviewing Johnson's domestic situation, providing additional explanation on this point. Why was it that "nothing in the past year pleased the president more than the progress in civil rights"? This official U.S. agency explained that it was because, "In 1965, apart from the events in Watts, there were no other large-scale violent actions."

    Speaking of the Watts incident last August, everyone knows that it was an unprecedented event in the history of the American Black struggle. Thousands upon thousands of Black masses began to take up arms to resist government suppression, an action that threatened the foundation of American imperialism's rule and reflected the revolutionary awakening of the American people. The American ruling group was greatly shocked by this event and remains apprehensive even now. Johnson actually taking the fact that this event only broke out once as what he was "most satisfied with" last year shows how dire the situation is for America's presidential masters. He fundamentally cannot find anything satisfactory in a year, so he has no choice but to boast about "bad luck" as if it were "satisfaction." (Picture Attached)

### 倒霉和“满意”

    倒霉和“满意”
    约翰逊向美国记者谈了他对一九六五年的回顾。美联社在今年元旦写道：“总统在一九六五年最大的失望是他在越南遇到挫折。他最满意的是民权方面取得进展。”
    约翰逊对美国在侵越战争中的处境表示“最大的失望”，这一点当然不难明白。但是，他所“最满意”的所谓“民权方面的进展”，究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    美国新闻处在一月二日发表了一篇约翰逊回顾国内情况的专稿，对这一点作了补充说明。美国这个官方机构解释道，为什么“过去一年内最使总统感到满意的莫过于民权方面的进展”呢？原来，这是因为，“在一九六五年，除了瓦茨区发生的事件以外，别的地方都没有爆发过大规模的暴力行动。”
    提起去年八月瓦茨区事件，谁都知道，这是美国黑人斗争史上的一个空前的事件。成千上万的黑人群众开始拿起武器抗击政府的镇压，这种行动威胁着美国帝国主义的统治根基，反映了美国人民的革命觉醒。美国统治集团对这个事件大感震惊，甚至到现在还是心有余悸。约翰逊居然还把这个事件只爆发一次作为他在去年“最满意的事”，这表明美国的总统老爷处境不妙到了何等程度。他在一年里根本找不到什么称心如意的事情，因此只好拿“倒霉”硬当成“满意”来夸耀了。（附图片）
