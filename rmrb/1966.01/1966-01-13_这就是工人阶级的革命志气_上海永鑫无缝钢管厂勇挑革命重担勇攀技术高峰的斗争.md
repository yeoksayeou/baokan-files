    This is the Revolutionary Ambition of the Working Class
    The Struggle of Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory to Bravely Shoulder Revolutionary Burdens and Scale Technological Peaks
    On the banks of the Huangpu River, there is a small factory with just over 300 people. The factory buildings are small and the equipment is simple, and it still retains reed sheds. This is the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory.
    It was this small factory that, in 1958, used indigenous equipment to produce China's first seamless steel tube using indigenous methods.
    It was this small factory that, in 1961, developed from producing ordinary steel tubes to small-diameter thin-walled tubes.
    It was this small factory that, since 1962, has been producing special-shaped seamless steel tubes using indigenous methods. Now, it can produce special-shaped tubes that resemble springs, crescent moons, or plum blossoms; there are pagoda-shaped, melon seed-shaped, ax-shaped, fried dough stick-shaped, round-front and square-back, and square-outside and round-inside shapes..., some of which do not even have suitable names yet.
    Visitors here all say: If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I really wouldn't believe that such complex special-shaped steel tubes could be made in such a simple factory! From the Yongxin Factory, people feel the enormous power of the self-reliance policy and the creative spirit of the Chinese working class.
    What path has the Yongxin Factory taken?
    It has taken a unique path of relying on the masses to continuously practice, continuously explore, and climb technological peaks. By the end of 1965, they had manufactured more than 170 varieties and specifications of various special-shaped steel tubes; including round steel tubes, the total number exceeded 1,200.
    It has taken the path of adhering to indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. The factory currently has 106 pieces of equipment, most of which have been innovated and manufactured indigenously.
    It has taken the path of adhering to self-reliance and running industry with the spirit of poor people. From 1960 to 1965, it turned over more than 12 million yuan in profits, while the state gave them only 1.1 million yuan during the same period.
    The path taken by the Yongxin Factory shows that, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Chinese working class is fully capable of rapidly scaling the peaks of science and technology.
    Tasks Bring Higher Levels
    In 1962, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry assigned Shanghai the task of trial-producing new seamless steel tube products in the second half of the year. In addition to round tubes, it formally issued specifications for three types of special-shaped steel tubes: square, rectangular, and elliptical, totaling four specifications.
    At a meeting convened by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Processing Industry Company, when the trial-production projects were laid out, the task of trial-producing round tubes was undertaken by other factories. The remaining special-shaped steel tubes had high requirements and a tight timeframe. Insiders could tell at a glance that this was a tough nut to crack, not easy money. Previously, although some steel tube factories had trial-produced a small amount of special-shaped steel tubes, they were all samples.
    Who would undertake this task?
    Shi Shengyu, the worker-turned-deputy head of the technical team at the Yongxin Factory, was very agitated: Special-shaped steel tubes used to be imported, but now our agricultural machinery factories and others need them, but they won't give them to us. The central leadership departments have entrusted such an important task to Shanghai, believing that Shanghai workers can win honor for the country and complete the task. We can't hesitate any longer! He said in simple and clear language: "We will undertake the trial production of special-shaped steel tubes!"
    The task was accepted, but Shi Shengyu was not very confident. The next morning, he went to report to the factory leaders.
    Party Branch Secretary Zhao Xixiang affirmed that this task was accepted correctly and well! The Yongxin Factory's workers should have such ambition and shoulder more burdens for the country. "As for how to do it?" the deputy director said: "Consult with the veteran masters!"
    The news of trial-producing special-shaped steel tubes quickly spread throughout the factory. Some supported it, while others doubted it, and there was a lot of discussion for a while. Some said that they had just produced small-diameter thin-walled tubes, and their position was not yet stable, so how could they advance again? They worried that in this way, special-shaped tubes would not be produced, and the old products would not be completed, and the title of red flag factory that had been maintained since 1958 might be lost.
    Some people believed that without technical data, without special equipment, and without engineering technicians, the conditions for trial-producing special-shaped steel tubes were not available at all.
    All of this was true. More than half of the workers were originally barbers, cobblers, shop assistants, rickshaw pullers, bathhouse workers, etc. From the current technical conditions, it was difficult to trial-produce special-shaped steel tubes in a very short period of time. But the Yongxin Factory's workers had their own "view of difficulties." They said that if there were no difficulties, the state would not need to assign this important task to Shanghai; difficulties are not terrible, it depends on how we deal with them.
    The Party Branch and everyone calculated two accounts together: an economic account and a political account. Regarding the trial production task of special-shaped steel tubes, they made an analogy, like doing arithmetic problems: From the perspective of Yongxin Factory alone, it may be "subtraction" (loss) for a while; but many factories and scientific research units can put their products on the market and make their research projects successful sooner with it, which is "addition"; for the entire country, it can accelerate the speed of socialist construction, which is not subtraction and addition, but "multiplication." They also linked the trial production task with the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles. The two accounts aroused the workers' determination to strive for progress!
    The Yongxin Factory's workers bravely undertook the trial production task of special-shaped steel tubes. With extremely tenacious perseverance, they successfully manufactured one kind of special-shaped steel tube after another, meeting the various requirements of users. In the process of completing arduous tasks, the Yongxin Factory advanced rapidly, and the Yongxin Factory's technical level was greatly improved.

    Ambition Breeds Courage
    What force inspired the Yongxin Factory's workers to dare to take such a big risk and insist on shouldering heavy burdens?
    Special-shaped steel tubes have extremely wide applications. Airplanes, automobiles, and ships need them; precision machinery and scientific instruments cannot do without them either.... However, these types of steel tubes used to be imported. Just as China's construction industry was developing rapidly, and the requirements for the varieties and specifications of special-shaped steel tubes were increasing, imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism further blockaded and made things difficult for us.
    When the Yongxin Factory's workers mentioned these things, they clenched their fists and glared their eyes, saying that it was simply too much! They called the special-shaped steel tubes they manufactured "tubes of honor."
    In 1963, a silk factory lacked a kind of unequal-sided rhomboid steel tube for its silk printing machinery, and some countries were unwilling to sell it to us. When the Yongxin Factory's workers learned about it, they put all their efforts into producing this kind of tube.
    One unit was trial-producing an important product and lacked a flexible tube with a surface shape like a wave, which could be continuously bent and twisted when installed on the machine. This strange tube had to be imported from certain countries, which was, of course, impossible. This unit sent people to many units in several cities, but they could not solve the problem. Finally, they found the Yongxin Factory.
    It stands to reason that the Yongxin Factory could also decline. The other party had no drawings and only made vague requests for the size and length of the tube; the factory did not have special equipment.... However, without saying anything, they took on the task.
    At that time, there were indeed some individuals who watched with a cold eye, saying "He who promises lightly keeps little faith!" In his opinion, the Yongxin Factory could not produce this kind of metal hose at all. Casually agreeing to others was just bragging and talking big.
    Is it bragging? No! Without drawings, design it yourself; don't know how to calculate, ask someone for help; without equipment, build indigenous ones. The pressure of trial production increased, and with a loud bang, the tube exploded. Oil flew towards the roof and sprinkled down like raindrops, covering people's faces and bodies. They wiped the oil off their faces and continued to work, and finally trial-produced it.
    Look, what great revolutionary courage revolutionary ambition aroused in Chinese workers! As long as the country urgently needs it, regardless of the size of the difficulty, regardless of the quantity, size, or specifications, the Yongxin Factory's workers dare to break through and dare to take on tasks.
    The Yongxin Factory made a regulation: As long as the new products that the higher authorities approve for trial production are not refused. No one, including the secretary and the director, has the right to refuse to accept; to refuse, it must be discussed by all the workers.
    Not only that, but they also actively wrote letters to users, asking for the very difficult tasks. They also advertised their new products everywhere, looking for special-shaped steel tube manufacturing tasks with newer varieties and higher requirements.

     Practice Creates Experience
    People see the Yongxin Factory constantly making one kind of special-shaped steel tube after another, winning honor for the country. Did they complete the tasks easily? No! For a small factory with weak technical strength and simple equipment, completing such tasks requires extraordinary hard work. The entire road to manufacturing special-shaped steel tubes is the road of repeated exploration and continuous practice by the Yongxin Factory's workers.
    As the young worker Ji Dequan said: "We learn one thing at a time, learning a craft every day!"
    Recalling the early days of trial-producing special-shaped steel tubes in 1962, the trial-production site was a small house no more than three or four tables wide, with a bumpy ground and ventilation at both ends. There were no tools there except for two files and two rulers.
    The Yongxin Factory's workers moved out an already scrapped five-ton small cold drawing machine from the warehouse, re-modified it, pieced it together, and installed it. The Party Branch selected Pan Ayao, an old worker who used to roll copper skin before liberation, Ji Dequan, a worker who transferred from burning tiger stoves, Li Zhiming, a worker who was originally a tailor, and Shi Shengyu, the worker-turned-deputy head of the technical team who used to be a lathe operator, to form a new product trial-production team. That's how it started.
    The first trial production was square and rectangular steel tubes. They imagined that pulling square tubes might be similar to making rice cakes. Whatever the mold looks like, the steel tube pulled out must also look like that. According to past experience, the tubes pulled out from round molds are round, and square tubes must be pulled from square molds. They made the molds square and upright, thinking that they would definitely be able to pull out square tubes!
    But unexpectedly, when the round tube blank entered the square mold, the steel tube that came out was not square, and the four sides were dented inward. Sometimes, pulling would break the tube....
    Failure forced people to jump out of the circle of old experience and explore new paths. Shi Shengyu and Ji Dequan, Li Zhiming and others picked up the pulled-in square tubes and found that some places were polished brightly, while others had not been touched. Based on the situation, they judged that this phenomenon was caused by the four sides of the mold being too straight. They took the files and filed the very hard mold one stroke at a time. They filed where it touched, and finally filed the four sides of the square mold into arcs, and the square tube was also successfully pulled out.
    Practice creates experience. The Yongxin Factory's workers used files to "file" out a law for producing square tubes: How large the arc of the four sides of the mold should be, the tube pulled out is exactly square.
    Pan Ayao has a catchphrase: "Try it!" This is how the Yongxin Factory's workers are, they will try whatever new task they encounter. "Try it" represents the Yongxin Factory's workers' enterprising spirit of daring to practice; "Try it" embodies their innovative spirit of daring to explore new paths; "Try it" also reflects their revolutionary tenacity of not being afraid of failure and repeatedly experimenting. The Yongxin Factory's workers have been constantly "trying it" in this way, and have tried out many complex steel tubes, and have tried out many indigenous methods and indigenous equipment with unique styles.
    The Yongxin Factory relied on Pan Ayao, Shi Shengyu, those indigenous experts and the workers, to successfully trial-produce more than 170 kinds of special-shaped steel tubes in just over three years.

    Tradition Creates a New Style
    As production develops and varieties become more and more advanced, should we continue to be self-reliant and work hard?
    The factory Party Branch raised a question to everyone as early as two years ago: How was our first seamless steel tube made in 1958? Let everyone discuss it.
    The Yongxin Factory's workers recalled: At that time, their factory had only more than 90 people, the entire factory area was 3.3 mu, all the machines were old antiques, and there was not a single engineer. With these conditions alone, without asking the state for a penny of investment, they used indigenous methods to produce the first seamless steel tube.
    The Yongxin Factory's workers said: Tradition cannot be lost! It is enough for the house to be protected from the sun and rain, why do we need high-rise buildings! Now, when trial-producing special-shaped steel tubes, we should continue to move forward along the road of self-reliance and indigenous methods!
    Pan Ayao said: If one person saves one penny, how many factories and how many people are there in the country, it would be amazing!
    The spirit of poor people who made the first seamless steel tube has been carried forward here. As production develops, money always needs to be spent, but without asking for state investment, the simple houses were repaired, and some reed sheds were added. They relied on cooperation to build indigenous equipment. Trial-producing fried dough stick-shaped steel tubes requires "flat bullets," which cost dozens of yuan to buy new. Pan Ayao asked a worker for a pair of old bullets and another worker for a pair of old shells, which solved the problem.
    The Party Branch Secretary of this factory, Zhao Xixiang, said: "We are a socialist enterprise and should start from the country and think about the needs of fraternal units!"
    Being in the workshop, having the motherland in mind, and having a global perspective—this is the mind of the Yongxin Factory's workers!

    这就是工人阶级的革命志气
    上海永鑫无缝钢管厂勇挑革命重担勇攀技术高峰的斗争
    黄浦江畔有一家只有三百多人的小厂，厂房矮小，设备简陋，至今还保留着芦席棚。这就是永鑫无缝钢管厂。
    正是这个小厂，一九五八年，用土设备，穿出了我国第一根土法生产的无缝钢管。
    正是这个小厂，一九六一年，从生产普通钢管发展到小口径薄壁管。
    正是这个小厂，从一九六二年以来，又用土办法生产异型无缝钢管。现在，它能生产的异型管，有的象弹簧，有的象月牙，有的象梅花；有宝塔形的，瓜子形的，斧头形的，油条形的，前圆后方的，外方内圆的……，有的到现在还没有合适的名字。　
    到这里参观的人都说：要不是亲眼看到，真不相信这么复杂的异型钢管，居然是在这么简陋的工厂中制成的！从永鑫厂，人们感受到自力更生方针的巨大威力和中国工人阶级的创造精神。
    永鑫厂走的是一条什么路？
    走的是依靠群众不断实践、不断探索，攀登技术高峰的独创之路。到一九六五年底为止，他们制造的各种异型钢管，品种规格已达一百七十多种；连同圆钢管在内，总数已超过一千二百种。
    走的是坚持土法上马、土洋结合的路。全厂现有一百零六台设备，大部分是自己革新和土法制造的。
    走的是坚持自力更生、用穷棒子精神办工业的路。从一九六○年到一九六五年，上缴利润一千二百多万元，而国家同期给他们的费用只有一百十万元。
    永鑫厂走过的道路说明，在毛泽东思想和党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，中国工人阶级完全能够迅速攀登科学技术高峰。
    任务带水平
    一九六二年，冶金工业部布置给上海下半年试制的无缝钢管新产品，除圆的以外，第一次正式下达了方形的、矩形的和椭圆形的三种共四个规格的异型钢管。
    在上海市钢铁加工工业公司召集的会议上，试制的项目一摊开，圆管子试制任务被其他厂承担去了。剩下的异型钢管，要求高，时间急，内行人一看就知道，这是块骨头不是肉，以前，虽然有的钢管厂试制过少量异型钢管，但都是样品。
    谁来承担这个任务？
    永鑫厂工人出身的技术组副组长石圣钰，内心翻滚得厉害：异型钢管过去是进口的，现在我们的农业机械厂等着用，人家却不给我们了。中央领导部门把这么重要的任务交给上海，就是相信上海工人能为国家争气，能够完成任务。再也不能犹豫了！他用简单明了的语言说：“异型钢管的试制任务，我们承担！”
    任务是接下来了，但是石圣钰心里并不很落实。第二天清早，他就去向厂领导汇报。
    党支部书记赵熙祥一口肯定，这任务接得对，接得好！永鑫厂的职工应该有这样的志气，为国家多挑重担。“至于究竟怎么搞法？”副厂长说：“找老师傅们商量商量！”
    试制异型钢管的消息，很快地在全厂传开了。有人拥护，也有人怀疑，一时议论纷纷。有人说，刚刚搞出小口径薄壁管，阵脚未稳，怎么又要前进了。他们担心，这样一来，异型管弄不出，老产品也完不成，一九五八年以来一直保持的红旗厂称号也可能会丢掉。
    有人认为，一无技术资料，二无专用设备，三无工程技术人员，试制异型钢管的条件根本不具备。
    凡此种种，都是事实。工人中，一半以上原先是理发员、皮匠、店员、三轮车工人、浴池工人等。从当前的技术条件来看，要在很短时间内试制出异型钢管，是有困难的。但是永鑫厂的职工有他们的“困难观”。他们说，如果没有困难，国家就不需要把这项重要任务下达给上海了；困难不可怕，就看我们怎样对待困难。
    党支部和大家一起算了两笔账：一笔经济账，一笔政治账。对异型钢管的试制任务，他们打了个比方，好比做算术题：从永鑫一个厂来说，一时可能是“减法”（亏本）；但是很多工厂、科学研究单位有了它，产品可以上马，研究项目可以早日成功，这却是“加法”；对整个国家来说，可以加速社会主义的建设速度，就不是减法和加法，而是“乘法”了。他们还把试制任务和反帝、反修斗争联系起来看。两笔账，算出了职工们奋发图强的锐气！
    永鑫厂职工勇敢地承担了异型钢管的试制任务，他们以极顽强的毅力，制造成功了一种又一种的异型钢管，满足了用户的各种要求。在完成繁重任务的过程中，永鑫厂飞速前进了，永鑫厂的技术水平大大提高了。
    志气出胆略
    是什么力量激起永鑫厂职工敢去冒这样大的风险，非挑重担不可？
    异型钢管用途极广。飞机、汽车、轮船要用到它；精密机械、科学仪器也离不了它……。然而，这类钢管过去是依靠进口的。正当我国建设事业飞跃发展，对异型钢管的品种规格要求越来越多的时候，帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义却进一步封锁、刁难我们。
    永鑫厂职工一提起这些，就握紧拳头、瞪起眼睛说，简直是欺人太甚！他们把自己制造的这些异型钢管，叫做“争气管”。
    一九六三年，一家绸厂印绸机械上缺少一种不等边菱形钢管，而有的国家又不肯卖给我们。永鑫厂职工知道了，一股劲就把这种管子搞了出来。
    有一个单位试制一项重要的产品，缺一种表面形状如波浪、装在机器上能不停地弯曲扭动的软管子。这种奇特的管子，要从某些国家进口，不用说是办不到的。这个单位派人跑了几个城市的很多个单位，都无法解决。最后，找到了永鑫厂。
    按说，永鑫厂也可以推辞。对方又无图纸，只提了管子两头大小、长度等笼统的要求；厂里又没有专用设备……。但是，他们二话没说就把任务接下来了。
    当时确实也有个别人冷眼旁观，说什么“轻诺者必寡信！”在他看来，永鑫厂根本拿不出这种金属软管来，随随便便答应人家，不过是吹牛皮，说大话。
    是吹牛皮吗？不！没有图纸，自己设计；不会计算，找人帮忙；没有设备，就造土的。试制的压力大了，“嘭”的一声巨响，管子炸开了。油飞向屋顶，象雨点般地洒下来，淋得人们满脸满身。他们抹去脸上的油污，继续干，终于试制出来了。
    看，革命志气激起了中国工人多么大的革命胆略！只要国家迫切需要，不论困难大小，不论数量多少、规格大小，永鑫厂职工敢闯敢干，敢于承担任务。
    永鑫厂作出了一项规定：只要上级批准试制的新产品，来者不拒。任何人，包括书记、厂长，都无权拒绝接受；要拒绝，必须经过全体职工讨论。
    不仅如此，他们还主动写信给用户，把很棘手的任务要过来。他们还四处宣传自己的新产品，寻找品种更新、要求更高的异型钢管制造任务。
     实践出经验
    人们看到永鑫厂不断制成一种又一种的异型钢管，为国家争了气。是不是他们轻而易举地就完成了任务呢？不！一个技术力量薄弱、设备简陋的小厂，要完成这样的任务，是要付出超乎寻常的艰辛劳动的。整个制造异型钢管的道路，就是永鑫厂职工反复摸索、不断实践的道路。
    恰如青年工人季德全所说：“我们是来一样学一样，天天在学手艺！”
    回忆一九六二年试制异型钢管的初期，试制场地是一间不过三、四张桌子宽的小屋子，地上坑坑洼洼，两头通风，那里除了两把锉刀、两把尺子，什么工具也没有。
    永鑫厂职工从仓库里搬出一台已经报废的五吨小冷拔机，重新改装，拼拼焊焊，安装起来。党支部选拔了解放前轧铜皮的老工人潘阿耀，烧老虎灶转业的工人季德全，做裁缝出身的工人李志明，车工出身的技术组副组长石圣钰，成立了新产品试制小组。就这样开张了。
    第一次试制的是方形和矩形钢管。他们设想，拉方管子可能跟做印糕差不多，模子是什么样子，拉出的钢管也一定是什么样子。根据过去的老经验，圆模子拉出的管子是圆的，方管子总得要方模子来拉。他们把模子做得方方正正，以为一定可以拉出方管子来！
    可是出乎意料，圆管坯从方模子进去，出来的钢管不是方的，四边瘪进去了。有时拉拉又把管子拉断了……。
    失败迫使人们跳出老经验的圈子，去摸索新的道路。石圣钰和季德全、李志明几个人，拿起拉瘪了的方管子，发现有的地方磨得发亮，有的还没有碰着。根据情况判断，这种现象是模子的四个边太直造成的。他们就拿了锉刀，一锉一锉地锉着那十分坚硬的模子。那里碰，就锉那里，最后竟把方模子的四个边锉成弧形，而方管子也拉成功了。
    实践出经验，永鑫厂职工用锉刀“锉”出了生产方管子的一条规律：模具四个边要多大的弧度，拉出的管子正好是方的。
    潘阿耀有句口头禅：“试试看！”永鑫厂职工就是这样，碰到什么样的新任务，都要去试试看。“试试看”，代表了永鑫厂职工勇于实践的创业精神；“试试看”，正体现了他们那种敢于探索新道路的创新精神；“试试看”，也反映了他们那种不怕失败、反复试验的革命韧劲。永鑫厂职工就是这样不断地“试试看”，试成了很多复杂的钢管，试出了很多具有独特风格的土办法和土设备。
    永鑫厂就是依靠潘阿耀、石圣钰那些土专家和工人群众，在短短三年多时间，试制成功一百七十多种异型钢管的。
    传统出新风
    生产在发展，品种越来越高级，要不要继续自力更生、艰苦奋斗？
    厂党支部早在两年以前，就向大家提出一个问题：一九五八年，我们的第一根无缝钢管是怎样造出来的？让大家议论。
    永鑫厂职工们回忆：那时，自己厂只有九十多人，全厂面积三亩三分，机器全是老古董，没有一个工程师。就凭这些条件，没有伸手向国家要一分投资，用土法穿出了第一根无缝钢管。
    永鑫厂职工们说：传统不能丢！房子只要太阳晒不到，下雨淋不到就行，何必要高楼大厦！现在试制异型钢管，应该沿着自力更生、土法上马的路继续前进！
    潘阿耀说：一个人省一分钱，全国有多少厂、多少人呀，就不得了！
    制成第一根无缝钢管的穷棒子精神，在这里发扬光大了。生产发展，钱总是要花一些的，但是没有要国家投资，简陋的房子修了修，还添了些芦席棚。他们自己动手，依靠协作，造出了一台台的土设备。试制油条形钢管需要“平面弹子”，买新的要几十元，潘阿耀向一个工人要了一副旧的弹子，向另一个工人要来一副旧的壳子，合起来解决了问题。
    这个厂的党支部书记赵熙祥说：“我们是社会主义企业，应该从国家出发，为兄弟单位着想！”
    身在车间，胸怀祖国，放眼世界——这就是永鑫厂职工们的胸怀！
