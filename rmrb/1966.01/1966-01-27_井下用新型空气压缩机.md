    New Air Compressor for Use in Mines

    A new type of air compressor for use in coal mines has been manufactured at the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory. This is the first time this type of air compressor has been produced in our country. It was designed and manufactured according to the requirements of China's coal industry and the working conditions of mines. Its structure is relatively compact and small, and it is easy to install, operate, and move. In order to adapt to the special requirements of underground production, this air compressor is also equipped with various automatic control and safety devices, which can automatically shut down in case of water shortage, oil shortage, or if the machine temperature exceeds requirements.
