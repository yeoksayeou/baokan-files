    HAVANA, January 30 (Xinhua News Agency) – The Cuban Communist Party’s newspaper *Granma* published on page 10 on January 12 the “Reply of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade to the Talk of the People’s Republic of China.” The full text is as follows (the bold type in the text is the original in *Granma*):
    The Chinese "Xinhua" News Agency published on January 10 a news release containing the talk of the "Person in Charge of the Ministry of Foreign Trade" of China to reporters. In his talk, he mentioned our Premier's remarks on January 2 regarding the 1966 trade negotiations between Cuba and China, making certain assertions. We believe it is necessary to give a very accurate and clear answer to this, so as to avoid any doubt about the absolute truthfulness of what our Premier said.
    I. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade official said: "The trade volume between China and Cuba in 1966... is somewhat lower than in 1965. However, it is still higher than in 1962 and 1963, and equivalent to the level of 1964." The official also said, "Premier Castro said that China's exports to Cuba had fallen to a level lower than any trade year from 1961 to 1965, which is not in accordance with the facts."
    According to the figures of the General Statistical Bureau of the Central Planning Committee of Cuba and the Statistical Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the trade situation between the two countries is as follows:
  Year    Cuba's exports to China    China's exports to Cuba    Total trade volume
                                         (in millions of pesos)
  1961    91.6               98.6               190.2
  1962    89.0               89.8               178.8
  1963    72.7               90.8               163.5
  1964    81.4               109.3              190.7
  1965    97.3               128.9              226.2
  1966    (85.0)             (85.0)             (170.0)
    The statistics for 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964 are calculated based on the total value of goods imported and exported by the country that year. It must be pointed out that due to the geographical distance between the two countries (a sea voyage of 45 to 60 days), there are always some goods in transit, so the statistical figures of the two countries may not be completely consistent. That is to say, goods that have been shipped and calculated in China have not been calculated in Cuba because they have not yet arrived, and vice versa. But even taking this situation into account, these discrepancies will not fundamentally change the above figures.
    The statistics for 1965 have not yet been calculated, and the figures cited are equivalent to the value of goods stipulated in the protocol for that year (including 250,000 tons of rice and 700,000 tons of sugar). The figures for 1966 roughly correspond to the value of goods that could be included in the protocol under the restrictions imposed by the Chinese side.
    The Premier did not talk about the trade volume between the two countries, but about "the value of our imports from China," that is, the total value of goods Cuba received from China, which is the figure that affects the needs of our residents.
    However, the figures in the table above show that regarding the trade volume (that is, the sum of the total value of imports and exports between one country and another each year), only the figure for 1963 is lower than that for 1966. As for the value of Cuba's imports mentioned by our Premier, the figure for 1966 will be lower than any year since 1961.
    In fact, considering the restrictions imposed on our sugar exports, the quantity of goods provided to Cuba, and the things that could be bought from China in order to implement the trade balance policy, imports from China stipulated in the 1966 protocol will reach 85 million pesos. That is to say:
    13.6 million less than the 98.6 million in 1961.
    4.8 million less than the 89.8 million in 1962.
    5.8 million less than the 90.8 million in 1963.
    24.3 million less than the 109.3 million in 1964.
    43.9 million less than the 128.9 million in 1965.
    Therefore, Comrade Premier Fidel Castro’s statement in his speech on January 2 that “the value of our imports from China will drop to a level lower than any trade year from 1961 to 1965” is absolutely true. The Cuban Revolutionary Government has never been accustomed to making assertions that are not strictly in accordance with the facts, and if there are any mistakes, they are always corrected without hesitation.
    II. In October 1964, talks on the 1965 trade protocol began in Havana, which were preliminary talks to be continued later in Beijing.
    The Chinese side had already agreed to supply us with 150,000 tons of rice that year, a slight increase from the 135,000 tons in 1964.
    Cuba was to receive 150,000 tons of rice in 1965, with prices varying depending on the variety, between 145 and 150 pesos per ton, in exchange for about 165,000 tons of sugar, with the price set at 6.11 cents per pound.
    It was at this time that the Premier of the Cuban Revolutionary Government suggested increasing the rice-for-sugar trade, as the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade official in the Xinhua News Agency manuscript said, "exchanging 370,000 tons of sugar for 250,000 tons of rice annually." That is to say, China was not providing 150,000 tons but 250,000 tons of rice, and Cuba was not providing 165,000 tons but 370,000 tons of sugar. Arithmetically speaking, Cuba was providing about 205,000 tons more sugar in exchange for 100,000 tons more rice. If this calculation is correct, then the ratio is almost exactly two to one.
    Therefore, the Premier's statement that Cuba's proposal was to increase the sugar-for-rice trade on the basis of two tons of sugar for one ton of rice is absolutely correct.
    III. Another part of the Chinese official’s talk said: "Premier Castro believes that China will supply Cuba with 250,000 tons of rice annually for a long time, which is unfounded."
    It would be much more reasonable to say this sentence the other way around: The Chinese government agreed to the request to supply 250,000 tons of rice and at the same time gave a more favorable response on the price issue than the Cuban side requested, which seemed to show special consideration for our economic needs. At that time, no one would have thought in the slightest that the Chinese government would consider drastically reducing this level of exchange in the following year without any prior notice. Otherwise, China's response to Cuba's proposal would not make any sense. This proposal—as the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade official agreed—was to increase the annual trade volume, and it was based on this confidence that we believed that we could get the same amount of supply in the coming years, a confidence that was naive, yet reasonable.
    IV. The Chinese talk acknowledges the fact that when the Cuban side requested to use the economic cooperation loan granted in 1960 to partially offset the trade deficit with China in 1966, the Chinese side replied that this issue should be raised to the government level (Foreign Economic Liaison Committee).
    However, they did not mention the fact that the Chinese delegation at the same time made it very clear that, regardless of consultation or not, the supply volume they proposed was the maximum and certain for the products and quantities they could supply us.
    In addition, the Chinese delegation pointed out that the trade in 1966 should be balanced, and that the Cuban products they purchased were limited to about 85 million pesos, so the products they sold to us were also limited to the same amount.
    Under these circumstances, it is incomprehensible that the Chinese side is surprised that "Cuba has not yet contacted our Foreign Economic Liaison Committee on this issue."
    Since the Chinese side's supply volume is already the maximum, why contact for loans? Since it has been clearly and decisively stated to us that the trade between the two sides should be balanced, what is the use of contacting for loans?
    Indeed, Cuban foreign trade officials are still in China, but since the Chinese side has clearly stipulated the trade conditions and quantities they are willing to accept, the work of these officials is limited to routine procedures such as signing contracts for the products they are willing to supply.
    V. It is by no means unusual for the Cuban Revolutionary Government to explain to the people the possible consequences of the sudden reduction of imports from the People's Republic of China by more than 40 million pesos from the previous year, because this is currently a serious and unexpected blow to our economy and has created an unsolvable problem in the supply of food grains that our people are accustomed to. From January of this year, the supply has had to be reduced to three pounds per person per month.
    It is indeed painful that the fact that the Cuban Revolutionary Government had to make this public explanation occurred not only on the eve of the First Tricontinental Conference of the Peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, but also at a time when American imperialism has intensified its economic blockade against Cuba, the price of sugar on the international market has fallen to the lowest level in twenty years, and Cuba has suffered the most severe drought since 1900.

### 古巴外贸部对我外贸部负责人谈话的答复

    古巴外贸部对我外贸部负责人谈话的答复
    新华社三十日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴共产党机关报《格拉玛报》一月十二日在第十版刊登了古巴《对外贸易部对中华人民共和国谈话的答复》。全文如下（文中的黑体字，是《格拉玛报》刊登时原有的）：
    中国“新华”通讯社在一月十日的新闻稿上刊登了中国“对外贸易部负责人”对记者的谈话，他在谈话中提到我国总理在一月二日演说中有关古中两国一九六六年贸易谈判的提法，作了某些断言，我们认为必须对此给予十分准确明了的答复，以免人们对我国总理所说的话的绝对真实性发生丝毫疑问。
    一、中国对外贸易部官员说：“一九六六年中古两国的贸易额……比一九六五年是有所下降。但是仍然高于一九六二年和一九六三年，而相当于一九六四年的水平。”这个官员还说，“卡斯特罗总理说，中国对古巴的出口下降到了比从一九六一年到一九六五年任何贸易年度都低的水平，这是不符合事实的。”
    根据古巴中央计划委员会统计总局和对外贸易部统计局的数字，两国的贸易情况如下：
  年份　古巴对中国的出口　中国对古巴的出口　总贸易额
                                      （以百万比索为单位）
  1961　91．6　           98．6　           190．2
  1962　89．0           　89．8             178．8
  1963　72．7           　90．8　           163．5
  1964　81．4　          109．3　           190．7
  1965　97．3　          128．9             226．2
  1966　（85．0）        （85．0）    　（170．0）
    一九六一年、一九六二年、一九六三年和一九六四年的统计数字是以这个国家当年进出口商品总额为基础算出来的。必须指出，由于地理上两国相距遥远（海路要走四十五到六十天），总是有些商品在运输途中，因此两国的统计数字可能不完全吻合。也就是说，在中国由于已经运出而已经计算的商品，在古巴由于尚未到达而没有计算在内，反之亦然。但是即使把这种情况考虑在内，这些出入不致于根本改变上述数字。
    一九六五年的统计数字还没有算出来，所引用的数字相当于这一年度议定书规定的商品值（包括二十五万吨大米和七十万吨糖）。一九六六年的数字约略相当于在中国方面加以限制的情况下可能列入议定书内的商品值。
    总理并没有谈到两国的贸易额，而是谈的“我国从中国的进口值”，也就是古巴从中国得到的商品的总值，对我国居民的需要有影响的就是这方面的数字。
    然而上面统计表的数字表明，关于贸易额（即一个国家与另一个国家之间每年的进出口总值的总和），只有一九六三年的数字低于一九六六年，至于我们总理所说的古巴的进口值，一九六六年的数字将低于一九六一年以来任何一年。
    实际上，考虑到强加于我们的糖的出口的限制、向古巴提供的商品数量以及执行贸易平衡政策等因素而可能从中国买到的东西来看，一九六六年议定书规定的从中国的进口将达到八千五百万比索。这就是说：
    比一九六一年的九千八百六十万少一千三百六十万。
    比一九六二年的八千九百八十万少四百八十万。
    比一九六三年的九千零八十万少五百八十万。
    比一九六四年的一亿零九百三十万少二千四百三十万。
    比一九六五年的一亿两千八百九十万少四千三百九十万。
    因此，总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗同志在一月二日演说中说“我们从中国的进口值将下降到比从一九六一年到一九六五年任何贸易年度都低的水平”，这是绝对真实的。古巴革命政府从来不惯于作不严格符合事实的断言，如果有什么错误，从来就是毫不犹豫地加以纠正。
    二、一九六四年十月在哈瓦那就一九六五年贸易议定书开始了会谈，这是随后在北京要继续的会谈的初步会谈。
    中国方面已经同意在那一年供应我们十五万吨大米，这比一九六四年的数字（十三万五千吨）稍有增加。
    古巴在一九六五年将得到十五万吨大米，价格随品种不同而异，每吨在一百四十五至一百五十比索之间，用来交换的是约十六万五千吨糖，价格规定为每磅六点一一分。
    正是在这时，古巴革命政府总理建议增加大米换糖的贸易，正如新华社稿件内中国对外贸易部官员所说，“每年用三十七万吨糖交换二十五万吨大米”。也就是说，中国不是提供十五万吨而是二十五万吨大米，古巴不是提供十六万五千吨而是三十七万吨糖。从算术上来说，古巴约多提供二十万五千吨糖，来换取多提供的十万吨大米，如果这种算法不错，那就是说比例几乎恰好是二比一。
    因此，总理说古巴的建议提出在两吨糖换一吨大米的基础上增加糖换大米的贸易，那是绝对正确的。
    三、中国官员谈话的另一部分说：“卡斯特罗总理认为中国将长期供应古巴每年二十五万吨大米，是没有根据的。”
    这句话恰好反过来说就合理得多了：中国政府同意了供应二十五万吨大米的要求，同时在价格问题上给予了比古巴方面的要求更为有利的答复，似乎表现了对我们的经济需要的特殊考虑，那时无论是谁都丝毫不会想到，中国政府会考虑在下一年事先没有任何表示即急剧降低这一交换水平的可能。否则，中国对古巴建议的答复就没有任何意义了，这个建议——正如中国对外贸易部的官员同意的一样——是为了提高每年的贸易额，正是基于这种信心，我们相信我们在今后的年份中能得到同样数量的供应，这种信心虽说天真，然而却是合情合理的。
    四、中国的谈话承认这一事实，即当古巴方面要求使用一九六○年给予的经济合作贷款来局部弥补一九六六年同中国贸易的差额时，中国方面回答说，这个问题应当向政府一级（对外经济联络委员会）提出。
    然而，他们没有提到的事实是，中国代表团同时十分明确地表示，不管磋商与否，关于他们可能供应我们的产品和数量，他们提出的供应量是最大限度的、肯定的了。
    此外，中国代表团指出，一九六六年的贸易应当平衡，他们所购买的古巴产品限于约八千五百万比索，因此他们卖给我们的产品也限制在同样的数量之内。
    在这种情况之下，中国方面以“至今古巴并未同我对外经济联络委员会就此问题进行接触”而感到奇怪，那是不可理解的。
    既然中国方面的供应量已是最大限度的了，那又何必接洽贷款呢？既然已向我们明确地断然表示双方的贸易应当平衡，接洽贷款又有什么用呢？
    的确，古巴对外贸易官员仍然在中国，但是既然中国方面已明确地规定了他们所愿接受的贸易条件和数量，那么这些官员的工作只不过限于就所愿供应的产品签订合同之类例行手续罢了。
    五、古巴革命政府向人民说明从中华人民共和国的进口突然比上一年减少四千万比索以上一事所可能产生的后果，这绝不是什么异乎寻常的事，因为这在目前情况下是对我国经济意外的严重打击，并给我国人民习用的粮食的供应造成了一时无法解决的问题，从今年一月起已不得不把供应量减少到每人每月三磅。
    使古巴革命政府不得不做这一公开解释的事实，不仅发生在第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议前夕，而且发生在美帝国主义加紧了对古巴的经济封锁、国际市场上的糖价降到二十年来的最低水平而古巴又遭到一九○○年以来最严重的旱情的时候，这的确是令人痛心的。
