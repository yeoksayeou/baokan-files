　　One day in August 1965, at a hospital in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, a pregnant woman suffering from severe eclampsia was finally rescued from a coma after several days and nights of emergency treatment and meticulous care by the Chinese medical team. When she saw her firstborn son healthy and unharmed, and saw the kind smile of Chinese doctor Hong Suying standing beside her, she was so moved that her eyes filled with tears. She immediately decided to name her beloved son "Hong Youyi" to forever commemorate the moving story of the Chinese medical team saving her and her son, a testament to the friendship between China and Somalia.

　　This incident began late on the night of August 19th. The Chinese medical team members were sound asleep after a day of hard work. Suddenly, the phone rang. The medical team members immediately rushed to the emergency room and found that the pregnant woman was convulsing all over her body, unconscious, and in danger of death from hypoxia and suffocation at any moment. Many foreign doctors believed she was beyond saving and shook their heads and walked away; the patient's family was weeping and covering their faces. The Chinese medical team members fully displayed the spirit of internationalism and the sense of responsibility to heal the wounded and rescue the dying, determined to overcome all difficulties, serve the African people, and not let an African sister die easily. They decided to perform an immediate operation to rescue her, personally carrying the patient into the operating room. When they discovered that the newborn infant was suffocating, they immediately rescued the infant. At that time, due to the lack of a tube to suction the secretions from the infant's mouth, the operating room nurse Li Fengying directly sucked it with her mouth, unafraid of dirt and fatigue, and finally made the infant, who had been suffocating for half an hour, cry out for the first time. After the operation, Dr. Hong Suying stayed by the bedside for more than thirty consecutive hours. After several days and nights of careful care by the Chinese medical staff, the seriously ill pregnant woman was finally brought back from danger.

　　The Chinese medical team consists of fifteen people. They were invited by the Somali government to come to Somalia in early July 1965 to participate in disaster relief work. Since then, they have been divided into two groups, one group being assigned to a hospital in Mogadishu, and the other group going to Belet Huen, more than 300 kilometers away from the capital. Whether in cities or villages, they are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and are enthusiastic, responsible, and wholeheartedly serving the African brothers and sisters. Therefore, in just half a year, with the strong support and cooperation of the Somali government and medical staff, they have saved many critically ill patients and relieved the suffering of many people afflicted by diseases, earning the praise of the broad masses of the Somali people.

　　When the Chinese medical team first arrived in Somalia, they encountered many difficulties due to language barriers, differences in medical systems and traditional habits between the two countries, and unfamiliar surroundings. In order to overcome difficulties and do their work well, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's articles "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," while gradually understanding the suffering of the African brothers under colonial rule, further enhancing their proletarian internationalist consciousness and strong sense of responsibility. They were constantly thinking of the entrustment of the people of their motherland and the expectations of the African people, and were determined to contribute all their strength to the health of the African brothers and sisters. Unable to communicate in the language, they insisted on learning Somali in their spare time. Now, most of the doctors can have ordinary conversations and talk to patients independently.

　　The team that went to work in Belet Huen traveled for eight hours under the equatorial sun. Upon arrival, they learned that a patient suffering from severe typhoid fever was in critical condition. Regardless of their fatigue, they worked overnight to rescue him. Lacking medicine, the Chinese medical staff rushed back to Mogadishu to buy it. After seven days and nights of rescue, the patient who was on the verge of death was finally saved.

　　The medical staff of this team, inside the hospital, carried medicine chests on their backs to inspect the wards, diagnosing, injecting, and giving medicine, reducing many procedures and bringing convenience to the patients; outside the hospital, they treated patients at any time they encountered them, and were available to visit patients' homes on call and were responsible to the end. Once, a female typhoid patient fell ill at home. When the Chinese doctor arrived, the patient was already unconscious and in a very serious condition, obviously it was too late to send her to the hospital, so the Chinese medical staff treated her at the patient's home, guarding the bedside for several nights, and finally saved the life of this critically ill patient. On another occasion, a young patient, about ten years old, suffered from toxic shock syndrome and also had pneumonia. His body temperature and blood pressure also dropped abnormally, and he was extremely weak, requiring hospitalization. However, the child's family did not want the child to be hospitalized. So the Chinese doctor traveled a long distance to treat and care for the child directly at his home. In this way, this young patient was also rescued from the brink of death and regained his health.

　　When the Chinese medical team was treating African patients, they paid great attention to adopting simple, easy-to-implement, and effective methods, doing everything possible to help patients recover their health as soon as possible and save costs. Wu Liang, a surgeon working at the Mogadishu Hospital, extensively researched the situation of hemorrhoids there and decided to treat them with injections, which was welcomed by the majority of patients. Dozens or even hundreds of people lined up every day to wait for him to treat them. Surgeons also used acupuncture, plaster application, massage, and other therapies to relieve patients' pain immediately and effectively, achieving good results.

　　The Chinese medical team also paid great attention to learning from Somali medical staff, exchanging techniques, cooperating closely, and uniting well.

　　For more than half a year, the Chinese medical team's patient, considerate, and responsible attitude towards patients has been trusted and praised by patients and their families in this country called the "Horn of Africa". Many patients who have been treated by the Chinese medical team have become close friends with the Chinese medical team members and have established deep friendships.

### 中国医疗队在“非洲之角”

    中国医疗队在“非洲之角”
    一九六五年八月的一天。在索马里首都摩加迪沙的一所医院里，一位患严重子癇病的产妇，经过中国医疗队几昼夜的抢救和精心护理，终于脱离昏迷状态，苏醒过来。当看到自己的第一胎男孩健壮无恙，看到站在旁边的中国医生洪素英的亲切笑容时，她激动得满眼热泪。她立即决定给她的爱子取名为“洪友谊”，以永远纪念中国医疗队抢救她母子的动人的中索友谊事迹。
    这件事情开始发生在八月十九日深夜。经过一天辛勤劳动后的中国医疗队人员正在酣睡中。突然，电话铃响了。医疗队人员立即赶到急诊室，发现这位产妇全身抽动，神志昏迷，随时有因缺氧窒息而死亡的危险。许多外国医生认为她无可挽救，摇摇头走开了；病人的家属在掩面哭泣。中国医疗队人员充分发扬国际主义精神和救死扶伤的责任感，决心克服一切困难，为非洲人民服务，不让一个非洲姐妹轻易死去。他们决定立即动手术进行抢救，亲自把病人抬进手术室。当发现刚降生的婴儿呼吸窒息时，马上又抢救婴儿。当时由于缺乏吸取婴儿口腔分泌物的胶管，手术室护士李凤英就直接用嘴吸，不怕脏，不怕累，终于使这个窒息达半小时之久的婴儿哭出了第一声。动手术后，洪素英大夫一连三十多小时守护在病床旁。经过中国医务人员一连几昼夜的精心护理，最后使这位重病产妇转危为安。
    中国医疗队共十五人，他们是应索马里政府的邀请，在一九六五年七月初来索马里参加灾区救护工作的。自那时起，他们分成两个小组，一组被分派在摩加迪沙一所医院，另一组到远离首都三百多公里的伯莱特温。不论在城市或乡村，他们都不怕苦，不怕累，热情负责，全心全意为非洲兄弟姐妹服务，因而在短短半年中，在索马里政府和医务人员的大力支持和合作下，挽救了许多生命垂危的病人，解除了许多受疾病折磨的人的痛苦，博得索马里广大人民的称颂。
    中国医疗队初到索马里时，由于语言不通，两国医疗制度和传统习惯不同，环境也不熟悉，曾经遇到许多困难。他们为了战胜困难，做好工作，反复学习了毛主席《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》等文章，同时逐渐了解非洲兄弟在殖民统治时期所受到的痛苦，更加提高了无产阶级国际主义觉悟和强烈的责任感。他们时刻想着祖国人民的委托，想着非洲人民的期望，决心为非洲兄弟姐妹的健康贡献自己的一切力量。语言不通，他们坚持在业余时间学索马里语，到现在，医生们大都可以作普通会话，独立地和病人交谈了。
    去伯莱特温工作的小组，在赤道的阳光下赶了八小时路刚到目的地时，得知一位患重伤寒的病人危在旦夕，他们顾不得休息，连夜进行抢救。没有药品，中国医务人员就赶回摩加迪沙购买，经过七昼夜的抢救，终于使这个濒临死亡的病人得救。
    这个小组的医务人员，在医院内，身背药箱查病房，边诊断，边打针给药，减免许多道手续，为病人带来方便；在医院外，遇到病人就随时诊治，对住家病人随叫随到，并负责到底。有一次，有一个女伤寒病人，病倒在家里。中国医生赶到时，病人已昏迷不醒，病势十分沉重，显然来不及送医院了，于是中国医务人员就在病人家里诊治，一连几个夜晚，守候病床，最后使这个生命垂危的病人得救。又有一次，一位十来岁的小病人，患中毒性休克症，同时有肺炎，体温和血压也反常地降低，人已虚弱不堪，需要住院治疗，但是小孩的家庭不愿小孩住院。于是中国医生就跑很远的路，直接到小孩家中去治疗和护理，就这样，这个小病人也从死亡线上被挽救过来，恢复了健康。
    中国医疗队在为非洲病人医疗时，很注意采用简便易行而效果良好的方法，千方百计地使病人早日恢复健康和节省费用。在摩加迪沙医院工作的外科医生吴良，广泛研究了那里的痔疮情况，决定打针治疗，受到广大病人的欢迎，每天有几十甚至几百人排队等他诊治。外科医生们还用针灸、贴膏药、按摩等疗法，立竿见影地为病人解除痛苦，收到良好效果。
    中国医疗队也很注意向索马里医务人员学习，互相传授技术，亲密合作，团结得很好。
    半年多来，中国医疗队人员耐心体贴、对病人负责到底的作风，在这个被称做“非洲之角”的国家，受到病人和他们的家属的信任和赞扬。许多经过中国医疗队诊治过的病人，都和中国医疗队人员结交为亲密的朋友，建立了深厚友谊。
