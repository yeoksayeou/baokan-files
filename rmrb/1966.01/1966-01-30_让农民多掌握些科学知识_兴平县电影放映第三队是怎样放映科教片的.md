    In the past few years, our county's Rural Film Projection Team No. 3, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Under the leadership of the Party, it has not only cooperated with the rural socialist education movement, carried out propaganda against imperialism and modern revisionism, and conducted propaganda to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, but also strengthened the promotion of scientific and educational films last year, playing a certain role in popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting production development.
    How did they do a good job in promoting scientific and educational films?
    Selecting Appropriate Films
    They selected appropriate films suitable for the location and time after investigation and research. In the past, they showed scientific and educational films indiscriminately, and the effect was not good. Once, they took "Three Major Diseases of Cabbage" to the mountainous areas for screening. The commune members watched and said, "We haven't grown cabbage here. Who knows what the movie is talking about?" Another time, they showed "Freshwater Fish Farming," and the audience was even less interested. These examples made them realize that the screening of scientific and educational films must pay attention to propaganda that is suitable for the location and time. Before the circuit screenings last year, according to the county party committee's instruction to focus on cotton field preparation for spring plowing, combined with cotton field preparation and an investigation and study of regional insect pests, they selected and screened nine films including "Cotton Seed Treatment," "Small Cutworm," "Unveiling the Secrets of Cotton Aphid Life," "Safe Use of Pesticides," and "Prevention of Equine Encephalomyelitis." Because it was timely combined with local production, it had a very good effect.
    Helping the Masses Understand the Films
    In terms of propaganda methods, they tried every means to make the masses understand. In order to let the masses watch and understand scientific and educational films, they did: introduction before the screening, explanation during the screening, summary during film changes, and concluding remarks after the entire program was screened. At the beginning of the circuit screenings, because they were not skilled enough in interjecting during the screening, the propaganda effect was not significant enough. Some comrades in the team believed that the scientific and educational films themselves had narration, and interjections were unnecessary. However, in several audience forums, the masses had such reactions: "The film is playing too fast" and "I can't understand the speech." This shows that the explanation work is still very necessary. The problem is to improve the quality of the interjections, making them timely, accurate, and easy to understand. In practice, after continuous exploration and research, they realized that using local dialects is a good way to help the audience understand the film. Once, when screening the film "Unveiling the Secrets of Cotton Aphid Life," they conducted a prior investigation and learned that some places call "cotton aphids" "oil sweat," and some places call them "greasy worms." Therefore, in the interjection explanations, they spoke according to local conditions, and the masses understood as soon as they heard it. In the middle of the screening, the masses discussed the cotton aphids on the screen, saying, "How can 'oil sweat' be so big?" After hearing this, the projectionist explained in a timely manner: This is a magnifying glass that has magnified the "oil sweat" in order to make it clear to everyone. This explanation solved the doubts of the masses. For example, in the film, the scene of ants eating cotton aphid feces was initially mistaken by the masses as ants eating cotton aphids. At this time, the film's narration was: "The things excreted by cotton aphids are sweet, and people call them honeydew. Ants are drinking honeydew." The local masses could not understand "excretion" and "honeydew," so the projectionist interjected using the local language: "Ants only like to eat what oil sweat excretes. This hobby of ants is also good for us, so we can see where ants climb along the stalks, there is oil sweat there." This kind of interjection explanation not only answered the audience's questions, but also provided the audience with common sense for discovering pest information.
    In order to help the masses truly understand the content of the film, this projection team also imitated the film and did experiments in public. For example, after screening the film "Small Cutworm," they captured cutworm moths and dissected them in public, took down the slide lens as a magnifying glass, and let the masses see the eggs in the moth's belly, which were as many as more than a thousand. The commune members were all surprised when they saw it, and believed the film's statement that "killing a moth in spring is equivalent to eliminating thousands of tiger moths in the future." Through physical observation, the masses had a deeper understanding of the film.
    Helping the Masses Apply Scientific Knowledge to Production
    This projection team has also done a lot of work on how to help the masses apply scientific knowledge to production. They have repeatedly used their rest time to help team cadres and technicians distribute insecticidal prescriptions, prepare insecticidal liquid for luring and killing moths, promote scientific methods, and mobilize the masses to follow the methods pointed out in the film. After watching the film "Cotton Seed Treatment," Zhang Fu, the captain of the first team of the Northeast Brigade of Dianzhang Commune, made two seed mixing devices according to the movie on the same day after a discussion. Some old farmers and technicians in some brigades said at the forum: "In the past, when we mixed seeds, we couldn't control the water temperature well. This time, after watching the movie and listening to the explanation, we will know how to mix seeds in the future." Many facts have proved that wherever they have seriously promoted scientific and educational films, the commune members, especially the young commune members, are very willing to use scientific methods and have achieved good results.

### 让农民多掌握些科学知识——兴平县电影放映第三队是怎样放映科教片的

    让农民多掌握些科学知识
    ——兴平县电影放映第三队是怎样放映科教片的
    几年来，我县农村电影放映第三队高举毛泽东思想红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在党的领导下，不仅配合了农村社会主义教育运动，进行了反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的宣传，进行了兴无灭资的宣传，并且在去年加强了科教影片的宣传，对普及科学知识、促进生产发展，也起了一定的作用。
    他们是怎样做好科教片的宣传呢？
    选择对口对路影片
    经过调查研究，因地因时选择对口、对路的影片。过去，他们对科教影片不加选择地进行放映，效果不好。有一次，他们带着《白菜三大病害》到塬上去放映，社员看了说：“咱这儿没种过白菜，谁知道电影上说的啥？”还有一次放映《淡水养鱼》，观众更是不感兴趣。通过这些事例，使他们体会到放映科教片必须注意因地适时宣传。去年巡回放映前，他们根据县委的春耕生产以棉田备耕为中心的指示，结合棉田备耕，对地区虫害作了调查研究，选映了《棉种处理》、《小地老虎》、《揭开棉蚜生活的秘密》、《安全使用农药》和《防止马结症》等九部影片，由于适时地结合了当地的生产，收效很好。
    帮助群众看懂影片
    在宣传方法上，他们想尽办法让群众看得懂。为了让群众看好、看懂科教影片，他们做到：映前有介绍，映间有解释，换片有小结，全部节目映完有总结语。初开始巡回映出时，由于他们对映间插话掌握得还不够熟练，宣传效果不够显著。队里有的同志就认为，科教片本身就有解说，插话不必要。但在几次观众座谈会上，群众都有这样的反映：“电影放的快”，“说话听不懂”。这说明解说工作还是十分必要的，问题是要提高插话的质量，使插话适时、准确、通俗易懂。他们在实践中，经过不断地摸索和钻研，体会到运用方言，是帮助观众看懂电影的好办法。有一次放映《揭开棉蚜生活的秘密》影片时，他们事前做了调查，了解到有些地方把“棉蚜”叫“油汗”，也有些地方叫“腻虫”。于是便在插话解说中，因地制宜去讲，群众一听就懂。放映中间群众议论银幕上的棉蚜说：“‘油汗’那有这么大？”放映员听到以后，就及时解释说：这是放大镜把“油汗”放大了，为的是让大家看得清楚。这一说就解决了群众的疑问。再如影片中蚂蚁吃棉蚜粪便的镜头，群众初看误认为是蚂蚁在吃棉蚜哩。这时影片的解说词是：“棉蚜排泄的东西是甜的，人们称作蜜露，蚂蚁在喝蜜露。”当地群众对“排泄”、“蜜露”听不懂，放映员就运用当地语言插话说：“蚂蚁光爱吃油汗屙下的。蚂蚁的这个爱好对咱们也有好处，让咱们可以看到哪里蚂蚁顺秆爬，那里就有油汗。”这样的插话解释，不但给观众解答了疑问，还给观众提供了发现虫害情报的常识。
    为了帮助群众真正理解影片内容，这个放映队还效仿影片当众作试验。如在放映《小地老虎》影片后，他们就捕捉了地老虎蛾子当众解剖，把幻灯镜头拿下来当作放大镜，让群众看蛾子肚子里的卵，竟达一千多个。社员一看都很惊讶，相信了电影上说的“春天杀一只蛾，等于日后消灭千条虎。”通过实物观察，群众对影片有了更深的领会。
    帮助群众把科学知识用到生产上去
    如何帮助群众把科学知识运用到生产中去，这个放映队也做了不少工作。他们曾多次利用休息时间帮助队干部和技术员，散发灭虫处方，配治诱杀蛾子药液，推行科学方法，动员广大群众按照影片指出的办法去做。店张公社东北大队一队队长张福看了《棉种处理》影片后，经过座谈，当天就照电影上的样子做了两个拌种器。有些大队的老农和技术员，在座谈会上说：“过去咱们拌种时，对水的温度掌握不好，这回看了电影，又听了解说，今后拌种心里就有数了。”许多事实证明，凡是他们利用科教片认真进行宣传过的地方，社员特别是青年社员，很愿意用科学方法，也收到较好的效果。
