    Daqing Workers' Poetry Selection
    Chairman Mao's Works Shine
    Sun Jiaxiang
    Chairman Mao's works shine brightly,
    The truth of revolution illuminates my heart,
    I don't get lost climbing mountains and crossing ridges,
    I know the direction in great storms.

    Chairman Mao's works are a clear spring,
    The spring water is clearer than honey,
    Drink a sip of the cool spring water,
    Endless wisdom and intelligence to use.

    Reading Chairman Mao's works makes my heart bright,
    My spirit is refreshed and I am full of strength,
    I fear no difficulties,
    I advance bravely without obstruction.

    Oil Blooms in Fury, Dedicated to the Party
    Cui Wanzhong
    The north wind is wild, freezing and snowy,
    Aluminum helmet warriors battle on the lake.
    Towering drilling rigs stand in the heart of the lake,
    Drilling wells on ice with heroic ambition.

    Not afraid of the cold wind piercing bones,
    Not caring that the drilling rig is covered in white frost.
    Mud splashing on the body turns into icy armor,
    Boiling blood and strong fighting spirit.

    The icy lake glistens with silver,
    Heroes from all directions set up battlefields.
    Thunder rumbles in the dragon gate formation,
    Red flags wave under the colorful clouds.

    What is there to fear from wind, snow, and severe cold?
    Chairman's teachings are remembered in my heart.
    Determined to fight hard through the coldest days,
    Oil blooms in fury, dedicated to the Party.

    Poetry Duel at the Well Site
    Driller of Drilling Team 1205:
    The north wind is strong, I'm not afraid,
    I step onto the drilling platform and hold the brake,
    Drilling through the earth for three thousand feet,
    Oil rolling everywhere under heaven.

    Drilling Worker:
    The north wind is strong, I'm not afraid,
    Tightening the tongs and lifting the slips,
    Hot sweat like rain sprinkles the ground,
    Petroleum flowers bloom for the motherland.

    Site Worker:
    The north wind is strong, I'm not afraid,
    The well site is my home,
    Fighting the oilfield against wind and rain,
    Drilling workers have no winter or summer.

    Rigger:
    The north wind is strong, I'm not afraid,
    Stepping on the ladder to the derrick,
    Climbing to the peak to see the world,
    Revolutionary red flags spread across the world.

    Together:
    The north wind is strong, we're not afraid,
    What is wind, snow, and severe cold?
    All for producing more oil,
    Striving for strength and drilling wells.

    All Rely on Mao Zedong Thought
    Liu Shangfu
    The moon shines because of the sun,
    The poor turn over because of the Party,
    Throwing off the backward petroleum hat,
    All relying on Mao Zedong Thought.

    Night Study of "Two Theories"
    The stars in the sky twinkle brightly,
    Bonfires glow red on the ground,
    The red light of "Two Theories" illuminates ten thousand people,
    The oilfield is filled with the sound of reading.

    Willing to Dedicate My Life to the Party
    Family Member Li Shuzhen
    Holding a steel rake to pull grass,
    The grass-collecting cart is my home.
    Remembering Chairman Mao's words,
    Heroic ambition in the wheat harvest battle,
    Mosquitoes bite, wheat awns sting,
    Sore arms are nothing!
    For the motherland to be rich and strong,
    Willing to dedicate my life to the Party.

    大庆工人诗选毛主席著作闪金光孙家祥毛主席著作闪金光，革命的真理照心上，翻山越岭不迷路，大风浪里知方向。毛主席著作是清泉，泉水清清比蜜甜，喝口泉里清凉水，聪明智慧用不完。毛主席的著作读了心里亮，精神焕发浑身是力量，千难万难都不怕，勇往直前无阻挡。油花怒放献给党崔万忠冰封雪冻北风狂，铝盔战士战湖上。巍峨钻塔湖心立，冰上打井豪志壮。不怕寒风刺冷骨，哪管钻塔结白霜。泥水扑身成冰甲，热血沸腾斗志强。冰湖披雪闪银光，四路英雄摆战场。龙门阵中雷声动，彩云下面红旗扬。风雪严寒有何惧，主席教导记心上。决心奋战三九天，油花怒放献给党。井场对诗一二○五钻井队司钻：北风大，我不怕，走上钻台扶刹把，钻穿大地三千尺，石油滚滚遍天下。钻工：北风大，我不怕，打完大钳提卡瓦，热汗如雨洒满地，祖国盛开石油花。场地工：北风大，我不怕，井场就是我的家，顶风冒雨战油田，钻井工人无冬夏。架工：北风大，我不怕，脚踏云梯上井架，登上高峰看世界，革命红旗遍天下。合：北风大，我不怕，风雪严寒算个啥，一切为了多出油，奋发图强把井打。全靠毛泽东思想
    刘尚福月亮放光靠太阳，穷人翻身靠着党，甩掉石油落后帽，全靠毛泽东思想。夜学“两论”天上星星亮晶晶，地下篝火一片红，“两论”红光照万人，油田一片读书声。愿把终生献给党家属　李淑贞手握钢扠把草扒，集草车就是我的家。想起毛主席的话，麦收苦战雄心大，蚊子咬，麦芒扎，胳臂发痠不算啥！为了祖国富又强，愿把终生献给党。
