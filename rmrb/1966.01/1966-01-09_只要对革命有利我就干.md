    We are publishing several articles written by workers from the Daqing Oilfield here. They warmly express how the people of Daqing, resolutely following Chairman Mao's teachings, transformed themselves and embarked on the path of conscious revolution in the great school and melting pot of Daqing. They vividly express how the people of Daqing endured hardship and worked diligently, achieving extraordinary accomplishments in ordinary and common work positions.

    I'll Do Whatever Benefits the Revolution
    Building socialism is like playing a game of chess, and an individual is like a chess piece. Where this chess piece is best placed should be decided according to the needs of the overall situation.
    I am a transferred soldier. During the battle (会战) in the past few years, I have worked as a shoe repairer, a storekeeper, and a bricklayer, among other jobs. Now I am feeding horses. Someone once asked me, "Old Huang, you are a 'Five-Good' pacesetter. How did you end up feeding horses?" I answered directly, "Feeding horses is also making revolution. If the 'Five-Good' pacesetter doesn't feed the horses, who will? As long as it benefits the revolution, anything goes." Chairman Mao taught us that a person's ability may be large or small, but as long as he has the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, he is a person who is beneficial to the people. I think: building socialism is like playing a game of chess, and an individual is a chess piece. Where this chess piece is best placed should be decided according to the needs of the overall situation. Therefore, every time I am transferred to a new job, no matter what I am assigned to do, I cheerfully obey the organization's decision and try my best to do the job well. In the early stage of the battle, workers had difficulty getting shoes repaired. The organization asked me to be a shoe repairer. I thought: if soldiers don't have shoes, they can't fight, and if workers don't have shoes, they can't do production well. Who can live without shoes? Repairing shoes for the workers is also revolutionary work! So I found a set of shoe repair tools and often carried a shoe repair kit to the construction site to repair shoes.

    Later, when the houses were damaged and needed repair, I carried a mud bucket and plastered the houses for everyone. In my work, I also bought my own carpentry tools and used my spare time to repair more than twenty wooden beds for everyone. I think: in our country, any work is serving the people and is glorious. You "serve" the people in this part of the "service," and he "serves" the people in that part of the "service." There is no high or low status here. Doing any work is a component of serving the people and should be done well.

    Now, I am feeding horses for the people. When I encounter difficulties, I use whether my service to the people is "complete" and "thorough" to measure myself. This enhances my confidence in overcoming difficulties.

    In order to feed the horses well, I often go to the veterinary station to learn breeding management experience and veterinary knowledge. Because I didn't understand the living habits of horses, I moved to the stable to sleep. I add fodder for the horses every night, and I also drive away mosquitoes for the horses in hot weather. Once, when adding fodder, I found that a mare did not eat grass, so I went home to make millet porridge for the horse to eat. Our breeding team loves this job very much. The horses we raise are all fat and strong, with shiny coats.

    What I do is some ordinary and trivial work, which is not worth mentioning, but I have one experience: as long as you connect your work with the revolutionary cause, you will not feel that it is ordinary and trivial, and you will want to do any work and do it better and better.

    我们这里发表了几篇大庆油田职工写的文章。他们亲切地道出了大庆人是怎样坚决按照毛主席的教导，改造自己，在大庆这个大学校、大熔炉中，走上了自觉革命的道路；他们生动地道出了大庆人是怎样吃苦耐劳，在平凡的、普通的工作岗位上，做出了不平凡的业绩。

    只要对革命有利我就干
    建设社会主义好比一盘棋，个人好比一颗棋子，这颗棋子放在哪里好，这要根据全盘需要来决定
    我是个转业战士。会战几年来，我先后干过修鞋工、保管工、瓦工等，现在是喂马。有人曾问我：“老黄，你是五好标兵，怎么搞来搞去又喂开马了？”我直截了当地回答说：“喂马也是干革命，五好标兵不喂马，让谁去喂？只要对革命有利，干什么都行。”毛主席教导我们，一个人能力有大小，只要他有全心全意为人民服务的精神，就是一个有益于人民的人。我想：建设社会主义好比一盘棋，个人是一颗棋子，这颗棋子放在哪里好，应根据全盘的需要来决定。因此，每次调动工作，不管分配我干什么，我都愉快地服从组织的决定，并尽力把工作干好。会战初期，职工穿鞋较困难，组织上叫我当修鞋工，我认为：战士没鞋穿打不了仗，工人没鞋穿也搞不好生产，谁离得开鞋呢？给工人们修好鞋，这也是革命工作！我就找了一套修鞋工具，经常挑着修鞋担子到工地修鞋。
    后来，房子坏了需要维修，我就担起泥桶，给大家抹房子。在工作中，我还自己买了木工工具，利用工作空隙时间，给大家修了二十多张木床。我想：在我们国家里，干什么工作都是为人民服务，都是光荣的。你为人民“服”这一部分“务”，他为人民“服”那一部分“务”，这里没有高低贵贱之分，干任何工作都是为人民服务的一个组成部分，都应该做好。
    现在，我为人民喂马。遇到困难，我就拿为人民服务是不是“完全”、“彻底”来衡量自己。这样，就增强了战胜困难的信心。
    为了喂好马，我经常到兽医站学习饲养管理经验和兽医知识。因为我对马的生活习性不了解，就搬到马棚里去睡，每天夜晚给马添料，热天还给马赶蚊子。一次添料，发现一匹母马不吃草，我就回家做小米粥给马吃。我们饲养班都很热爱这行工作。我们饲养的马，个个膘肥体壮，毛梢儿油亮。
    我做的是一些平凡琐细的工作，本来不值得一提，但我有一点体会：只要把自己的工作和革命事业联系起来，就不觉得平凡琐细，什么工作都想干，都想干得好上加好。
