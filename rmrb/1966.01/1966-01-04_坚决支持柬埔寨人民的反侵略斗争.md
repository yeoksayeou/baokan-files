    At the end of 1965, the American aggressors and their lackeys, the puppet armies of South Vietnam and Thailand, launched successive ground attacks as well as aerial bombardments and strafing against the border areas of Cambodia. The Cambodian government and people expressed strong indignation at the military aggression of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The military and civilians in the Cambodian border areas resolutely and heroically fought back against the invading enemies.
    U.S. imperialism's military aggression against Cambodia has recently become increasingly rampant. In December of last year, such aggressions occurred continuously and on an increasingly larger scale. After the incidents on December 10th and 19th when U.S.-South Vietnamese troops invaded the Cambodian border, the Washington authorities openly clamored for authorization for U.S. invading forces to "pursue" into Cambodian territory. Then, on December 30th, a serious incident occurred in which Thai troops violently attacked a Cambodian border military post, killing eight Cambodians. On December 31st, U.S.-South Vietnamese troops, in addition to ground invasions, even dispatched aircraft to drop napalm bombs on Cambodian border villages, injuring two Cambodians. The aggression against Cambodia, whether directly carried out by U.S. troops, or by South Vietnamese puppet troops, or by Thai puppet troops, is instigated and directed by U.S. imperialism, and is an integral part of U.S. imperialism's sinister plan to expand its war of aggression in South Vietnam to the entire Indochina.
    Reading the Bible while wielding a butcher knife, this is what U.S. imperialism does. The Johnson administration is releasing a great deal of "peace" smokescreens on the Vietnam issue, but what it is actually doing is expanding the war. The American aggressors are not only expanding the war of aggression in South Vietnam, but also extending the flames of war in Laos and Cambodia. The reason why U.S. imperialism wants to launch armed aggression against Cambodia is because Cambodia pursues a policy of peace and neutrality and cherishes its independence and sovereignty. U.S. imperialism regards independent, peaceful, and neutral Cambodia as a thorn in its side, and therefore must remove it. Recent developments indicate that U.S. imperialism is eager to put its sinister plan into action. This cannot but arouse the serious attention of all peace-loving countries. The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on January 1st, calling on all countries around the world to take measures to safeguard the peace of Cambodia, which is being subjected to armed aggression by Thailand. This solemn appeal should be taken seriously by all peace-loving countries.
    In the face of armed aggression by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the border defense forces of the Kingdom of Cambodia demonstrated heroic spirit in resolutely safeguarding national independence and territorial sovereignty, and successfully repelled the enemy's attacks. This shows that the Cambodian people are not to be trifled with. The Cambodian government has recently issued serious warnings to U.S. imperialism and its vassals on many occasions: in order to deal with a full-scale American invasion, Cambodia has made arrangements in national defense, and Cambodia will use all means at its disposal, at all costs, to resist all attacks in order to defend Cambodia's independence, neutrality, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Prince Sihanouk, in a speech on the 2nd, once again emphasized: "U.S. imperialists and their vassals should not think that they can swallow Cambodia in one bite. We now tell them: once war is declared, no matter what situation we may encounter, we will fight to the end, and we are confident that we will win the final victory." This is the voice of six million Cambodian people. The Cambodian people say what they mean and mean what they say. U.S. imperialism, which is already in a terrible predicament on the South Vietnamese battlefield, is bound to suffer a bloody nose if it insists on testing the determination and strength of the Cambodian people.
    Cambodia's struggle against aggression is just, and the just cause will surely receive the support of the people of the world. In the Cambodian people's struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its vassals, the 650 million Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of Cambodia and resolutely give full support. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 3rd, solemnly stating that "the Chinese government and the Chinese people are closely watching the development of the situation and reiterate that they will fully support the Cambodian people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs." The Cambodian people are a heroic people. If U.S. imperialism dares to spread the flames of war to Cambodia, we believe that the Cambodian people will, together with the Vietnamese and Lao people, drive the American aggressors out of Indochina. Victory will surely belong to the Cambodian and Indochinese people who are fighting to resist aggression.

### 坚决支持柬埔寨人民的反侵略斗争

    坚决支持柬埔寨人民的反侵略斗争
    在一九六五年年终的时候，美国侵略者及其仆从南越和泰国的傀儡军队，接二连三地向柬埔寨的边境地区发动了地面攻击以及空中轰炸和扫射。柬埔寨政府和人民对美帝国主义及其走狗的军事侵犯，表示了强烈的愤慨。柬埔寨边境地区的军民给予了入侵的敌人以坚决英勇的反击。
    美帝国主义对柬埔寨的军事侵犯，最近越来越为猖狂。去年十二月，这种侵犯不断地发生，而且规模日益扩大。去年十二月十日、十九日美国—南越军队侵入柬埔寨边境的事件发生之后，华盛顿当局公开叫嚷授权美国侵略军“追击”到柬埔寨境内。接着，十二月三十日就发生了泰国军队猛烈进攻柬埔寨边境的一个军事哨所，打死八名柬埔寨人的严重事件。十二月三十一日，美国—南越军队竟然在地面入侵的同时，还出动飞机向柬埔寨边境村庄投扔凝固汽油弹，炸伤两名柬埔寨人。对柬埔寨的侵犯，不管是美国军队直接干的，还是南越傀儡军队干的，或者泰国傀儡军队干的，都是由美帝国主义策动和指使的，都是美帝国主义企图把它侵略南越的战争扩大到整个印度支那的罪恶计划的一个组成部分。
    口念圣经，手执屠刀，这就是美帝国主义的所作所为。约翰逊政府正在越南问题上大放其“和平”的烟幕，可是它实际干的却是扩大战争的勾当。美国侵略者不仅在南越扩大侵略战争，而且也在老挝、柬埔寨扩大战火。美帝国主义所以要对柬埔寨发动武装侵犯，就是因为柬埔寨奉行和平中立的政策，珍惜自己的独立和主权。美帝国主义把独立、和平、中立的柬埔寨视作眼中钉，因而非要拔掉它不可。最近的事态表明，美帝国主义急于要把它的罪恶计划付诸行动了。这不能不引起一切爱好和平的国家的严重注意。柬埔寨王国政府一月一日发表声明，呼吁全世界各国采取措施，来维护受到泰国武装侵略的柬埔寨的和平。这一庄严的呼吁，应当受到一切爱好和平的国家的重视。
    在美帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略面前，柬埔寨王国的边防军队表现了坚决维护国家独立和领土主权的英勇气概，胜利地击退了敌人的进攻。这表明柬埔寨人民是不可轻侮的。柬埔寨政府最近曾多次向美帝国主义及其仆从提出严重警告：为了对付美国的全面入侵，柬埔寨已在国防方面作好了部署，柬埔寨将以自己所拥有的手段，不惜代价抗击一切进攻，以保卫柬埔寨的独立、中立、主权和领土完整。西哈努克亲王在二日发表讲话，再一次强调说：“美帝国主义者及其仆从切勿自以为可以一口吃掉柬埔寨。我们现在正告他们：一旦宣战，不管我们可能遇到什么情况，我们将干到底，并且我们确信将赢得最后胜利。”这是六百万柬埔寨人民的声音，柬埔寨人民是说得到做得到的。已经在南越战场上弄得狼狈不堪的美帝国主义，如果硬要试一试柬埔寨人民的决心和力量，它一定要碰得头破血流。
    柬埔寨反抗侵略的斗争是正义的，正义的事业必将得到全世界人民的支持。在柬埔寨人民反抗美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略的斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民坚决站在柬埔寨这一边，坚决给予全力的支援。我外交部一月三日发表声明郑重表示，“中国政府和中国人民正密切注视着局势的发展，并且重申，将全力支援柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争。”柬埔寨人民是英勇的人民。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战火烧向柬埔寨，我们相信，柬埔寨人民必将同越南人民和老挝人民一道，把美国侵略者赶出印度支那。胜利一定是属于为反抗侵略而战斗的柬埔寨和印度支那人民的。
