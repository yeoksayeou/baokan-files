	A Few Words

	The U.S. State Department announced that it would be very gracious and issue passports to American doctors and scientists in the fields of public health and medicine to travel to China, Vietnam, Korea, Albania, and Cuba. It is said that the U.S. government is doing this out of “fundamental concern” for human health and out of “policy and humanitarian considerations.”

	American imperialism has engaged in germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people and is still conducting chemical warfare against the Vietnamese people. Where do they get the nerve to talk about humanitarianism? Then why are they suddenly "fundamentally concerned" about human health since December 29th of last year? Have they changed their nature? Of course not. The so-called "humanitarian considerations" are complete nonsense; "policy" considerations are the real reason. This policy is none other than a counter-revolutionary two-pronged approach. The Johnson administration is currently trying its best to spread a smoke screen of "peace" to cover up its plot to expand the war. It wants to use the issuance of passports to a few doctors as a gesture of willingness for peace. But this hypocritical act of the fox chanting scriptures can only make people sick.

	The South Vietnamese puppet regime fantasizes about launching a "Let's Go Home" movement to the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. Nguyễn Cao Kỳ wrote a letter "calling" on them to "stop fighting and return to their loved ones."

	This clown is really confused and demented. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has long been carrying out the "Let's Go Home" movement since 1961. After years of fighting, many of them are already with their loved ones, and they want to make all the South Vietnamese people together with their loved ones. Nguyễn Cao Kỳ wants to arouse the homesickness of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army with his "call." That's great. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army will respond to his "call" and strengthen the fight with a hundredfold bravery, so that the day when all relatives are liberated will come sooner!

    三言两语
    美国国务院宣布将大开恩典，发护照给美国的医生和公共卫生与医学界的科学家到中国、越南、朝鲜、阿尔巴尼亚和古巴去旅行。据说，美国政府这样做，是出于对人类健康的
  “根本性关心”，出于“政策上和人道上的考虑”。
    美帝国主义对中朝人民进行过细菌战、现在还对越南人民进行着化学战，他们哪里讲什么人道呢？那末，他们何以从去年十二月二十九日起对人类的健康忽然“根本性关心”起来呢？是他们转了性了吗？当然不是的。所谓“出于人道上的考虑”完全是鬼话，出于“政策上”的考虑倒是真。这个政策不是别的，而是反革命两手政策。约翰逊政府目前正在竭力散布“和平”烟幕来掩盖它扩大战争的阴谋，它想利用颁发几名医生出国护照来作为一种愿意和平的姿态。但是，这种狐狸挂念珠的假惺惺作态，只能令人作呕。

    南越傀儡政权异想天开，要向南越解放军发动一个“让我们回家去”的运动，阮高其写信“号召”他们“停止战斗，回到亲人那里去”。
    这个小丑真是糊涂到发昏了。南越解放军从一九六一年起早就开展“让我们回家去”的运动了。经过几年来的战斗，他们中的许多人已经和自己的亲人在一起，他们还要使所有南越人民同自己的亲人在一起。阮高其想以他的“号召”来唤起南越解放军的乡思。那好得很。南越解放军将会响应他的“号召”，百倍英勇地加强战斗，使全体亲人获得解放的日子早日到来。
