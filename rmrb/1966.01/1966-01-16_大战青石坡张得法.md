    Great Battle at Green Stone Slope: Zhang Defa
  　Qian Yun

    West of North Slope Brigade's village, there's a mountain called Stone Buddha Mountain. On Stone Buddha Mountain, there's a large slope called Green Stone Slope. On Green Stone Slope, trees can't take root, sheep can't graze; the most annoying thing is that whenever it rains, flash floods roll down with green stones, sweeping away the crops at the foot of the slope!

    The brigade Party branch decided that as soon as the autumn harvest was over, they would manage Green Stone Slope. That night, a meeting of team cadres and poor and lower-middle peasant representatives was held to discuss management methods. After discussing it back and forth, everyone was stumped by one thing. Who would lead the stone embankment team?

    The stone embankment of a terraced field is like the foundation of a tall building, requiring a long-term perspective. If it's not built firmly, it will be washed away by a flash flood. Therefore, this leader must: first, understand the technology; second, have a red heart dedicated to collective entrepreneurship.

    Surely, in a village as large as North Slope Brigade, they couldn't find such a person? Yes! And everyone present thought of the same person; but no one mentioned it. Suddenly, the door "banged" open. With the sound of the door opening, an old man in his sixties walked in. As soon as the old man entered the room, he shouted, "When was I, the poor peasant association representative, dismissed? Huh! Discussing such an important matter without even telling me!"

    The Party branch secretary helped the old man to sit down and explained, "Uncle Caizhi, don't be angry. Originally, we wanted to inform you, but then we considered that it was dark at night, your eyesight is not good, and you have back pain, so..."

    "Alright! Alright! Stop explaining. Let me ask you again, why didn't you mention my name when you were discussing who would lead the stone embankment team? Don't you know I can build stone embankments, or what?"

    "This,..."

    "Don't 'this' and 'that.' If you don't mention me, I'll nominate myself. I, Guo Caizhi, will lead this stone embankment work! Whether you agree or not, I've decided to be the leader!"

    It turned out that when the Party branch was considering managing Green Stone Slope, the Party branch secretary had individually sought the opinion of the old man Caizhi. Since then, he had climbed Green Stone Slope alone many times, inspecting the terrain and pondering the project plan. Tonight, he wanted to talk to the Party branch secretary about his plans. Hearing that the secretary had gone to the team headquarters for a meeting, he hurried to the team headquarters. At the door, he heard everyone discussing the selection of a leader for the stone embankment team. After listening for a long time, no one mentioned his name at all. The old man couldn't restrain himself, so he broke into the meeting.

    The old man Guo Caizhi, is already sixty-five years old. Not only is he an experienced farmer, but he also has excellent stonemasonry skills. When it comes to loving the collective, everyone praises him. The person everyone had in mind earlier was precisely him, but they didn't mention him out of consideration for his old age and frail health.

    A few days later, the Green Stone Slope management project began. The once empty and quiet Green Stone Slope suddenly became lively.

    The stone embankment team, except for the old man Caizhi, were all young men. The old man, while working, guided everyone:

    "This drill is not the pen you use for writing; you have to use both hands to hold it steady, otherwise your hand will get hit by the hammer!"

    "When moving stones, keep your back straight. That's it...! That way you can exert your strength!"

    Some of the old man's words were quite blunt. One young man whispered to another, "If I had known building stone embankments was so difficult, I wouldn't have come!" The old man Caizhi heard these words but didn't say anything at the time. During the break, he asked the young men to sit down before saying: "This old man is talkative, but you must not be offended! You, don't know how the older generation survived in the old society."

    The old man pondered for a moment, then continued: "It was more than thirty years ago. That year, I begged for food and came here. With everyone's help, I built a grass hut at the foot of this Green Stone Slope and started clearing the mountain for farming. After finally cultivating a few acres of land, I made it to autumn. Before the crops were even harvested, the evil landlord Song Guoshi came and said that this slope belonged to him and insisted that I pay rent. Isn't this blatant oppression! I reasoned with him, but before I could finish a sentence, Song Guoshi hit me in the waist with a stick. …That's why, now when it's cloudy and rainy, my back aches as if it's broken!" Old man Caizhi said, looking at the young people around him, and said kindly: "Now, the landlords and rich peasants have been overthrown by us, but, the old sky is still not subdued by us. Can we let the old sky oppress us? No! We must subdue the old sky just like we subdued the landlords and rich peasants. No matter how much effort it takes, no matter how much hardship we endure, we must subdue it!"

    The young men felt warm in their hearts after hearing old man Caizhi's words. From then on, they held the steel drills more firmly, and swung the iron hammers higher. The sound of iron hammers striking steel drills, the sound of mountain rocks breaking, made the Green Stone Slope under their feet tremble! (Attached picture)

    大战青石坡张得法
  　钱筠
    北坡大队的村西头，有一架山，名叫石佛山。石佛山上有一面大坡，名叫青石坡。这青石坡栽树不扎根，牧羊没青草；最恼人的是，天一下雨山洪卷着青石块哗哗往下滚，把坡下的庄稼一扫而光！
    大队党支部决定秋收一罢，便治理青石坡。这天黑夜，召开队干部和贫下中农代表会议，商量治理办法。商量来商量去，大家却被一件事给难住了。谁来领导垒石岸小组呢？
    梯田的石岸犹如高楼大厦的墙基，要讲究百年大计。垒得不结实，一场山洪便冲垮了。所以，这个领头人，必须：一得懂技术；二更得有一颗为集体创业的红心。
    北坡大队这么大个村庄，难道就找不到一个这样的人？有！而且在坐的人，心里都不约而同地想到了这个人；可是谁也没提出来。忽然房门“咣当”一声被推开了。随着开门声，走进来一位六十多岁的老人。这位老人进得屋来，就嚷了起来：“我这贫协代表，是啥时给撤了？啊！讨论这么大的事，都不对我言语一声！”
    党支书一面扶老人坐下，一面解释说：“财只大爷，你别生气，原是想通知你的，后来考虑到黑天半夜，你眼神不好，又有腰痛病，所以……”
    “好啦！好啦！别解释了。我再问你，刚才你们研究领导垒石岸小组的人，为什么不提我的名字？是不知道我会垒石岸，还是咋？”
    “这，……”
    “不要这呀那呀。你们不提我，我就自己提自己。这垒石岸的活路由我郭财只领导！你们同意也罢，不同意也罢，这个头儿，我算是当定了！”
    原来，在酝酿治理青石坡的时候，党支书曾个别征求过财只老汉的意见。打那以后，他就多次一个人登上青石坡，察看地形，琢磨工程计划。今黑夜，他想找党支书说说自己的打算。听说支书上队部开会来了，便赶到了队部。走到门口，听见大家正讨论领导垒石岸小组的人选。听了半天压根儿就没人提他的名字。老汉忍不住了，这才闯进了会场。
    郭财只老汉，今年已经六十五岁了，不仅种庄稼是个老把式，还有一手好石匠活。要说热爱集体，更是人人称道，个个夸赞。刚才大家心里想的那个人，就正是他，所以没提出来，是考虑到他偌大年纪，身体又不壮实的缘故。
    不几天，治理青石坡的工程开始了。往日空旷静寂的青石坡，霎时间热闹起来了。
    垒石岸小组，除了财只老汉以外，其余的都是年轻后生。老汉一面干，一面指导大家：
    “这钎，可不是你写字用的笔，得两手使劲掌稳，要不你的手要挨铁锤了！”
    “搬石块要把腰干挺直。对……！这就能使上劲啦！”
    老汉有的话说的挺冲。一个青年悄悄地对另一个伙伴嘟嚷说：“我早知道垒石岸这样费劲，就不来了！”财只老汉听到这话，当时没言语。到休息的时候，他让青年都坐下，才说道：我这个老头儿爱唠叨，你们可不能见怪呀！你们，不知道老一辈在旧社会是怎样熬过来的。”
    老汉沉思了一会儿，接着说道：“算起来是三十多年前的事了。那年，我讨吃要饭，来到了这里，在大伙的帮衬下，就在这青石坡下搭了个草窝，上山开荒。好容易开了几亩地，熬到了秋天。庄稼还没割倒，万恶的地主宋国士找来了，说这一面坡是他的，硬要我交租子。这不明明是欺压人吗！我和他说理，我一句话还没说完，宋国士齐腰给了我一棍。……这不，到现在阴天下雨，我这腰就象断了似的作痛！……”财只老汉说到这里，瞧了一眼围在身旁的年轻人，慈祥地说道：“现在，地主老财被咱们打倒了，可是，老天爷还不服咱们管。咱们能让老天爷欺压吗？不能！咱们要象制服地主老财那样，制服老天爷。费多大劲，吃多大苦也要制服它！”
    年轻人听了财只老汉的话，心里感到热乎乎的。以后钢钎掌得更牢了，铁锤抡得更高了。铁锤敲击钢钎的声音，山石破裂的声音，震得脚下的青石坡直发抖！（附图片）
