    I Received an Education
    I am a cadre from the Nanqu Commune in Hanggin Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia. On the evening of December 15th last year, as soon as I entered my home, I saw my thirteen-year-old child fighting with another child from our production team, and his head was slightly injured. At the time I was very angry, and I wanted to go to his parents to reason with them. Because it was late, I didn't go. The next day, when I got up, I prepared to go find the child's parents. I passed by the brigade, and it just so happened that the postman was delivering the newspaper. I read the article "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Catties" in the People's Daily, and I read it three times back and forth. I thought, Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan's son was accidentally pushed into the water and drowned by a child, and they were able to care for others in this way. My own child's head was slightly injured, and they were also poor peasants, and besides, it was just children playing, but I had taken this kind of attitude. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that my thinking was too backward, how could I ruin the harmony for such a thing? So I took the newspaper and ran home. As soon as I entered, my wife asked, "What did they say? Make sure they pay for the medical expenses." I said:
  "Sit down and listen to me read a passage from the newspaper." After I read it, she smiled and asked me, "You didn't go to find them, did you?" I said, "I didn't go." She said, "It's good that you didn't go. Other people's child died, they can be so forgiving, we must learn from them."

    我受到了教育
    我是内蒙古杭锦后旗南渠公社的一个干部。去年十二月十五日晚上，我一进家门，看到我的十三岁的孩子和本生产队另一个小孩打架，头部受了点小伤。当时我很生气，就想去找他家的大人讲理。因天晚没有去成，第二天起来，就准备去找那个小孩的家长。路过大队，可巧邮递员送报来，我从人民日报上看了《阶级感情千斤重》这篇文章，我反来复去看了三次。我想人家张永安、程春兰的儿子被小朋友失手推下水去淹死，能够这样地关怀别人。自己的孩子头部受点小伤，人家也是贫农，况且是小孩玩耍，却采取了这种态度。自己越想越感到自己的思想太落后了，怎么能为这样的事伤了和气呢？于是我拿上这张报就往家里跑，一进门我的爱人就问：“他们怎么说的，看病的钱一定叫他们出。”我说：
  “你坐下，听我给你念一段报。”我念了以后，她笑着问我：“你没找人家去吧？”我说：“没去。”她说：“没去就好，人家小孩死了，可以让人，咱们一定好好向人家学习。”
