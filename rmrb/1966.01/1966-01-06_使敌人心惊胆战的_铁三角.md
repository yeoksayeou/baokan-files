    The "Iron Triangle" – whenever the American aggressors and the South Vietnamese puppet troops mention this name, they lose their courage and tremble with fear.
      "Iron Triangle" is the name the US-puppet clique gave to this area after suffering countless fatal blows from the local military and civilians. In the minds of the US-puppet clique's "strategists," this
  "Iron Triangle" area includes the half-moon-shaped zone formed by Bei Lei, An Renxi, Long Yuan, and War Zone D, which is close to the Bien Hoa-Bien Cat defense line, the last defense line for the enemy to protect the Saigon-Gia Dinh area. Whether viewed locally or on a map, the above-mentioned areas are merely quiet and beautiful villages like thousands upon thousands of others in South Vietnam. However, these villages possess an endless and magical power. This is the local people's indestructible revolutionary spirit and their deep-seated hatred for the enemy. It is they who have transformed the local beautiful natural scenery into an impregnable iron wall and a fiery net that is fatal to the invading enemy. Many enemy strongholds have been leveled, and many "strategic hamlets" established by the enemy have been destroyed. The "Iron Triangle" is indeed a thorn in the enemy's side, causing them sleepless nights. Precisely because of this, the enemy has exhausted all kinds of conspiracies and vicious means in a vain attempt to remove this thorn in order to break through the increasingly tight encirclement of the US-puppet clique's lair in Saigon by the South Vietnamese people, cut off the interconnected liberated areas, and swallow them up bit by bit.
    In order to realize their vicious conspiracy, the US-puppet clique has resorted to everything from using small batches of special forces for surprise attacks and small "sweeps" to launching large-scale "sweeps" with forces of six or seven thousand troops each time, with a menacing air. However, all the enemy's activities have been met with heavy blows from the local military and civilians. Therefore, US imperialism and its lackeys had to resort again to the so-called "American air superiority." On March 31st of last year, the enemy dispatched a hundred aircraft to conduct continuous and indiscriminate bombing of Bei Lei; on June 18th, they dispatched thirty B-52 strategic bombers to drop a rain of dense bombs on the vast area of Long Yuan; then, they dispatched a large number of puppet troops to conduct "sweeps." The enemy was confident that after the assault of the dense
  "rain of bombs," the local military and civilians would completely lose their ability to resist, and their troops would be able to complete the
  "sweep" mission smoothly. However, the result was completely the opposite. The local troops had already prepared to deal with all situations. The enemy's bombs and incendiary bombs could only destroy some houses and trees on the ground. As soon as the enemy arrived, they were immediately surrounded by guerrillas rushing out of underground tunnels from all directions. The enemy was beaten and fled in disarray. For example, from May 8th to 11th last year, a regiment of puppet troops launched a "sweep" on Run De, south of An Renxi, but an entire battalion was wiped out by the Liberation Army and guerrillas, and another battalion was heavily damaged, causing the death of more than five hundred enemies.
    The "Iron Triangle" is also a graveyard for American aggressor troops. Last October, when the entire force of the US First Infantry Division landed in the eastern part of southern Vietnam, they combined the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and some Australian and New Zealand mercenary troops, and only then did they pluck up the courage to plan an invasion of the "Iron Triangle."
    On November 11th, a brigade of the US First Infantry Division, in coordination with thousands of puppet troops, deployed forces on Highway 13, intending to "sweep" Long Yuan. The next night, as soon as this brigade of the US Infantry Division arrived at Bao Bang to garrison, more than two thousand of them were wiped out by the Liberation Army and local guerrillas.
    Three days before this, when the US 173rd Airborne Brigade had just scurried to Duc Co in War Zone D, it was also met with a head-on blow from the Liberation Armed Forces. In this battle, more than five hundred American aggressors were killed, and the American soldiers who were lucky enough to survive fled for their lives. By November 20th, an armored vehicle convoy of the US First Infantry Division was ambushed by the local military and civilians while traveling in the Gan Che area, and forty tanks and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, as well as more than five hundred American devils, were wiped out. A battalion of puppet troops accompanying them was also completely annihilated. On December 5th, more than one regiment of the US
  First Infantry Division was ambushed again at the Huo Da River, close to Long Yuan, and more than eight hundred people were wiped out.
      The military and civilians in the "Iron Triangle" area have won one brilliant victory after another, growing stronger as they fight, annihilating large numbers of the enemy's living forces, and protecting the land of their homeland like an iron wall. The "Iron Triangle" is like an incomparably sharp dagger, pointing at the enemy's nest, making the enemy tremble with fear!

### 使敌人心惊胆战的“铁三角”

    使敌人心惊胆战的“铁三角”
      “铁三角”——每当美国侵略军和南越伪军提到这个名字时，都会丧魂失魄，吓得发抖。
      “铁三角”，是美伪集团在遭到当地军民无数次致命打击后给这个地区所起的名字。在美伪集团的“战略家”心目中，这个
  “铁三角”地区包括紧靠边葛—边和防线，也就是敌人保卫西贡—嘉定地区的最后防线的贝累、安仁西、隆原和D战区所形成的半月形地带。无论从当地或从地图上看去，上述地区只不过是一些如同南越千千万万个乡村一样宁静、美丽的乡村。但是，这些乡村却也有着一种无穷无尽的神奇力量。这就是当地人民坚不可摧的革命精神和对敌人的刻骨仇恨。是他们，已把当地美好的自然风物，变成一座对于来犯的敌人说来是致命的铁壁铜墙和火网。敌人的许多据点已经被夷平，敌人建立的许多“战略村”也已被捣毁。“铁三角”，对于敌人来说，确是一个使它们日夜坐卧不安的眼中钉。正因为如此，敌人使尽一切阴谋诡计和恶毒手段，妄图拔除这个眼中钉，以便突破南越人民对美伪集团的老巢西贡所形成的日益紧密的包围，把连成一气的解放区切断，并一口一口地吞掉。
    为了实现恶毒的阴谋，美伪集团从使用小批别动队进行突然袭击和小“扫荡”，直到每次出动六七千兵力，气势汹汹地进行大
  “扫荡”。但是，敌人的所有活动都遭到了当地军民的沉重打击。于是，美帝国主义及其走狗只好又乞灵于所谓“美国的空中优势”。去年三月三十一日，敌人出动了一百架飞机，对贝累进行了连续不断的狂轰滥炸；六月十八日，又出动了三十架B—52型战略轰炸机，对隆原的广大地区投下了雨点一样密集的炸弹；接着，就出动了大批伪军来进行“扫荡”。敌人满以为经过密集的
  “弹雨”的袭击，当地军民就会完全失去抗御的力量，它们的军队就能安安稳稳地完成
  “扫荡”的任务。但是，结果却完全相反，当地军队早已作好对付一切情况的准备。敌人的炸弹和燃烧弹，只能毁坏地面的一些房屋和树木。当敌人一到，立刻就被从四面八方的地洞里冲出来的游击队紧紧包围。敌人被打得丢盔弃甲，大败而逃。例如，去年五月八日至十一日，伪军的一个团对安仁西以南的润德发动“扫荡”，就被解放军和游击队全歼一个营，并重创了另外一个营，使五百多个敌人丧命。
    “铁三角”，对于美国侵略军来说，同样是坟墓。去年十月，当美国第一步兵师的全部人马在南越南部东区登陆后，他们把美国第一七三空降旅和一部分澳大利亚、新西兰仆从军凑在一起，才又壮着胆子，盘算进犯“铁三角”。
    十一月十一日，美国第一步兵师的一个旅与成千伪军相配合，在十三号公路摆开阵势，打算“扫荡”隆原。第二天晚上，美国步兵师的这个旅刚到达保邦驻扎，立即被解放军和当地游击队歼灭两千多人。
    在这之前三天，当美国第一七三空降旅刚刚窜到D战区的德古时，也遭到了解放武装力量的当头棒喝。这一仗，五百多个美国侵略者丧命，侥幸活命的美国兵则没命逃窜。到了十一月二十日，美国第一步兵师的一个装甲车队在甘车地区行进中，又遭到了当地军民的伏击，四十辆坦克和M—113两栖装甲车，五百多美国鬼子被歼灭。随行的一营伪军也被全部歼灭。十二月五日，美国第
  一步兵师的一个多团又在紧靠隆原的霍达河遭到伏击，被歼八百多人。
      “铁三角”地区的军民获得了一次又一次辉煌的胜利，越战越强，消灭了敌人的大批有生力量，铜墙铁壁般保卫着自己故乡的土地。“铁三角”象是一把锋利无比的尖刀，指向敌人的巢穴，使敌人心惊胆战！
