    New Year's Message
    The year's calendar turns a new page. Joyfully looking back, the past year has been a thousand-fold of miraculous peaks. Iron arms and silver hoes dance high and low, changing the landscape of heaven and earth. We can't get enough of the flying mountains and crossing rivers. Everywhere, heroic ambitions surpass Dazhai, listening to songs overflowing throughout China. News of victory spreads, filling our hearts with fervor.
    The spirit of China is full of vigor. Let it be, the snow confuses the sky, and the dark clouds press down on the city. Holding high the great banner, the red waves surge, how many Lei Feng and Wang Jie. Opening up a great cause for ten thousand generations of peace. The universe has endless wishes, wishing the journey to spread wings and rush to the Heavenly Palace. Shoot the White Tiger, embrace the Bright Moon.

    新年献词
    岁历翻新页。喜回头，一年经过，奇峰千叠。铁臂银锄高下舞，改变乾坤陈设。看不尽山飞水越。处处雄心超大寨，听歌声洋溢乎中国。传捷报，满腔热。
    神州意气多风发。任凭他，迷天雪乱，压城云黑。高举大旗红浪涌，多少雷锋王杰。开万世太平事业。宇宙无穷无尽愿，愿征程奋翼冲天阙。射白虎，揽明月。
