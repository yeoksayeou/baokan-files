    Red Lanterns and Colorful Paintings Celebrate the New Spring

    Just as the first year of our country's great Third Five-Year Plan arrives, the "North China Region 1966 New Year Picture and Print Exhibition," reflecting our people's self-reliance, striving, and building of a socialist motherland, has opened in Beijing. This exhibition was organized with the care of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the active preparation of the Chinese Artists Association and its North China regional branches. The themes of this New Year picture and print creation are relatively broad, highlighting politics, enthusiastically praising the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; expressing the struggle life of socialist revolution and socialist construction in urban and rural areas from many aspects, focusing on the major themes emerging from the three great revolutionary movements in the North China region. In total, there are more than seven hundred and sixty works, distributed in the four halls of the Art Museum.
    The layout and design work of this exhibition also embodies the diverse ways in which art serves workers, peasants, soldiers, and herdsmen. They use traditional forms popular with the masses, innovating and developing them to express socialist content.
    Entering the East Gate of the Art Museum, a couplet on the stone pillars on both sides reads: "Create for the revolution, take root in life." On both sides of the preface sign, two revolving lanterns are hung high, using the form of shadow puppets to form an image of a marching column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and militia.
    Two rows of colored lanterns are hung under the left and right mezzanines of the rest hall. Directly ahead is the east side hall, exhibiting New Year pictures, prints, slides, and some works from Shanxi by the Beijing troops.
    In the Hebei Works Hall, facing you are two large door paintings with a vermilion background, and a pair of hexagonal colored red lanterns in front of the door, painted with content such as "Learning from Dazhai" and "Scientific Farming." Five red paper-cut hanging slips are pasted on the lintel, with a screen wall doufang with "People's Commune is Good" in the center, and golden folk paper-cuts inlaid on the white gauze of the cabinet fans on both sides of the screen wall. In the small foyer in the northeast corner, a model of a Shanxi residential courtyard is arranged. Inside this "courtyard," door paintings, New Year pictures, kang-enclosing paintings, etc. are pasted on the doors and in the room. Through this model, we feel as if we are on the scene. Here you can also see four window frames of cave dwellings, with new window decorations pasted on the window frames of operas such as "The Red Lantern" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage." In addition, in this foyer, you can also see stove paintings, kang-enclosing paintings, central hall paintings, couplets, etc., colorful and dazzling.
    Further inside is the Inner Mongolia Works Hall, where a yurt is arranged. In the center of the yurt is a portrait of Chairman Mao, and New Year pictures are hung on the felt walls around. In addition, some daily necessities are arranged in the yurt. From here we can see a glimpse of the cultural life of the herdsmen on the Inner Mongolia grasslands.
    Before we even walk into the southwest corner of the hall, we can already hear pleasant and moving gongs and drums. It turns out that "pulling foreign films" is being performed for the audience here. These "foreign films" are narrative propaganda paintings drawn by Beijing art workers on the content of aiding Vietnam and resisting the United States. This is part of the Beijing exhibits.
    Touring the venue for a week is like walking through the four provinces and regions of North China. We share the joy of the festival with the working masses. Through their works, we have a deeper understanding of the role and significance of art creation in the actual life of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The art workers in the North China region have made remarkable achievements in serving the farmers with art. We wish them greater victories on the road ahead.

    红灯彩画庆新春
    郁风
    正当我国伟大的第三个五年计划的第一年到来的时刻，一个反映我国人民自力更生、奋发图强、建设社会主义祖国的“华北区一九六六年年画版画展览会”在北京开幕了。这个展览是在中共中央华北局的关怀下，在中国美术家协会和华北地区各分会的积极筹备下举办的。这次年画版画创作的题材比较广泛，并且突出了政治，热情地歌颂了共产党和毛主席；从多方面表现了城乡社会主义革命和社会主义建设的斗争生活，着重地表现了华北地区三大革命运动中出现的重大题材。全部计有七百六十余幅作品，分布在美术馆的四个大厅里。
    这次展览的布置设计工作，也体现了美术为工农兵和牧民服务的多种途径。他们利用群众喜闻乐见的传统形式，加以推陈出新，表现了社会主义的内容。
    走进美术馆的东门，两边石柱上一幅对联：为革命而创作，在生活中扎根。在前言牌的两侧，迎面高挂着两盏走马灯，它是用皮影的形式，组成一个中国人民解放军，陆、海、空军和民兵前进行列的形象。
    休息厅的左右阁楼下悬挂着两行彩灯。正面是东侧厅，展出了北京部队的年画、版画、幻灯片和山西的一部分作品。
    在河北作品馆里，迎面是两幅朱红底子的大门画，门前一对六角彩色红灯，上面画的是：学习大寨和科学种田等内容。门额上贴着五条红剪纸挂笺，正中有一幅“人民公社好”的影壁斗方，影壁两旁的阁扇白纱上镶嵌着金色的民间剪纸。在东北角的小过厅里，布置了一个山西的民居庭院的模型，这个“庭院”里面在门上和室内贴着门画、年画、炕围画等，通过这个模型，使我们如身临其境。在这里还可以看到四扇窑洞窗棂，窗棂上贴着《红灯记》、《小二黑结婚》等戏出的新窗花。此外在这个过厅里还可以看到灶画、炕围画、中堂、对联等，五彩缤纷，琳琅满目。
    再往里走是内蒙古作品馆，这里布置了一个蒙古包，在蒙古包里的正中央，挂着毛主席象，四围的毡壁上挂着年画，另外在蒙古包里还布置了一些生活用品，从这里我们可以看到内蒙古草原上牧民文化生活的一斑。
    我们还未走进西南角的大厅，就已经听到悦耳动听的锣鼓声，原来这里正在为观众演唱“拉洋片”，这些“洋片”是北京美术工作者绘制的援越抗美等内容的说唱宣传画片。这是北京展品的一部分。
    巡视会场一周，仿佛是走遍了华北四省区，我们和劳动群众一起，共享着节日的欢乐。通过他们的作品，使我们更加深刻地了解到美术创作在工农兵实际生活中的作用和意义。华北地区的美术工作者，在美术为农民服务方面，做出了显著的成绩，预祝他们在前进的道路上取得更大的胜利。
