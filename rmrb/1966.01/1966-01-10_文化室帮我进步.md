    Culture Room Helps Me Progress
    Lian Shouzhi, Cultural Instructor of the Cultural Room, Dashugou Production Team, Dingxi County, Gansu

    In 1962, I returned to my village after graduating from junior high school to participate in agricultural production, but I always felt that laboring in the mountain valley was a dead end, and I was determined to go far away. The production team assigned me to be a feeder, and although I accepted it verbally, I was still unwilling in my heart, resulting in the livestock becoming thin.

    Later, a culture room was established here. In the culture room, I read Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Combat Liberalism," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which greatly educated me. It seemed that every word of Chairman Mao was directed at me. Lying on the kang at night, thinking over and over, I felt uncomfortable comparing myself with Zhang Side and Bethune, and realized that my thinking was wrong. My thoughts stabilized, and my energy came back. During labor, I rushed to the front. The culture room asked me to be an instructor for studying Chairman Mao's works and a teacher in the literacy class. To teach the literacy class at night, I had to climb a mountain and cross a deep gully, but no matter how tired I was, I attended classes as usual. Some poor and lower-middle peasant children couldn't write, so I guided them by hand. I was very happy to be able to do something for the villagers.

    In the culture room, I was educated, improved my thinking, and settled down to production. I deeply realized that I, a junior high school graduate, have a great role to play in our mountain area. In the future, I will not only work and study hard, but also contribute to running a socialist culture room well.

    文化室帮我进步
    甘肃定西县大树沟生产队文化室文化教员　连守智
    一九六二年，我高小毕业回乡参加了农业生产，但总觉得在山沟里劳动，没出息，一心想远走高飞。生产队派我当饲养员，嘴上虽然接受了，可心里还是不愿意，结果把牲口给喂瘦了。
    后来，我们这里办起了文化室，在文化室里，我读了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《反对自由主义》、《愚公移山》等文章，使我受到了很大的教育，好象毛主席的每一句话都针对我说的。晚上睡在炕上，想过来想过去，自己和张思德、白求恩一比，心里难受得不成，认识到自己的想法错了。思想安定了，劲头也来了。劳动时，我抢着干在前面。文化室里让我当学习毛主席著作的辅导员，识字班教员。晚上教识字班，要爬一架山，过一条深沟，但是不管多累，我都照常上课。有些贫农下中农娃娃不会写字，我就把着手教。我能给乡亲们做一点事情，我心里很高兴。
    在文化室里，我受到了教育，提高了思想，安心了生产。我深深体会到，我这个高小毕业生，在我们这个山区里是大有作为的。今后，我不但要努力劳动、学习，而且要为办好社会主义文化室贡献自己的力量。
