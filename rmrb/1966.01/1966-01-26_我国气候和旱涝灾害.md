    China's Climate and Drought and Flood Disasters
    Lu Wu

    This article points out: Due to natural causes, China will have drought and flood disasters every year. Even if most areas have evenly distributed rainfall, some local areas will still experience droughts and floods. In the past sixty years, there have been no fewer than thirty or forty large-scale droughts and floods, and there have been many instances of continuous droughts for two or three years. The large amount of material provided in this article illustrates a truth, that in a country as vast and with such complex natural conditions as ours, it is extremely important to do a good job in preparing for famine. We must make ideological and material preparations for possible drought and flood phenomena, and continuously strengthen our ability to resist disasters, so that we can be invincible in the face of disasters. – Editor

    The Climatic Background of Drought and Flood Disasters in China

    China is located in the eastern part of the world's largest landmass – the Eurasian continent, bordering the world's largest ocean – the Pacific Ocean, and spanning the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones. Its territory is vast, and the thermal effects of the continent and the ocean have an extremely dramatic impact on China's climate. The prevalence of monsoons in most areas, with distinct seasons of cold, warmth, dryness, and humidity, is the basic characteristic of China's climate. In winter, northerly winds (also known as winter monsoons) blowing from Siberia and the Arctic Ocean control most of China, resulting in a cold and dry climate. In summer, southerly winds (also known as summer monsoons) from the southeastern ocean gradually expand from south to north, prevailing in the eastern half of China, with a climate mainly characterized by hot and humid weather. Spring and autumn are transitional periods of rise and fall of the winter and summer monsoons, with a relatively mild climate. Most of China's precipitation occurs during the interaction of the winter and summer monsoons, which differ greatly in dryness, humidity, cold, and warmth, and is therefore also called monsoon rain. Throughout the year, the northward and southward movement of the winter and summer monsoons and the changes in their intensity determine the distribution of precipitation in China in terms of region and time.

    The distribution of precipitation in China throughout the year varies greatly both regionally and temporally. Regionally, because the water vapor that causes China's large-scale monsoon rainfall mainly comes from the southeastern ocean, the northern latitude is higher and farther from the southeastern ocean. After the warm and humid air from the south travels a long distance to the north, the water vapor is exhausted, so the further north and west into the interior, the less precipitation there is. In the areas south of the Yangtze River, the annual rainfall is generally 1,000 to 2,000 millimeters, while in the North China and Northeast Plains it is only 500 to 1,000 millimeters, and in most areas of the Northwest it is less than 300 millimeters. Temporally, about 50 percent of the rain falls during the three summer months when the winter and summer monsoons are actively interacting, while winter precipitation accounts for about 10 percent of the annual total. In southern China, because monsoon rains arrive early and retreat late, and rain belts pass back and forth twice a year, the phenomenon of rain concentrated in summer is not very significant, and precipitation in spring and autumn is quite abundant, sometimes even exceeding that of summer. The further north, due to the late arrival and early retreat of the summer monsoon, the rain season is short, and the concentration of rain is very significant. In some areas of the North China Plain, summer rainfall accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the annual total, spring and autumn each account for about 10 percent, and winter is less than 2 to 3 percent. Taking Beijing as an example, the proportion of precipitation in spring, summer, autumn, and winter to the annual total is 9.4 percent, 75.3 percent, 13.6 percent, and 1.7 percent, respectively. Another characteristic of China's monsoon rainfall is its high intensity and frequent heavy rains. A large proportion of the rainfall during the rainy season is often concentrated in several heavy rain events. Therefore, even during the rainy season, there are often periods of prolonged little or no rain. These situations are more obvious in the north than in the south. In some areas of the North China Plain, there are an average of two to four heavy rains per year, most of which occur in July and August. The amount of heavy rain sometimes accounts for about half of the annual rainfall. For example, in Shijiazhuang in early August 1963, rainfall reached 738 millimeters during a continuous heavy rain process, accounting for 70.4 percent of the total rainfall for that year. However, after the heavy rain, there was only a total of 15 millimeters of precipitation in the two ten-day periods of mid-to-late August of the same year. During the intense interaction of the winter and summer monsoons, the intensity of heavy rains in China is often astonishing. On August 4, 1963, the 24-hour rainfall record of Zhangmao Commune in Xingtai, Hebei Province, reached 865 millimeters. Although this is a relatively rare situation, records of daily rainfall exceeding 200 or 300 millimeters are common in China every year, while in some countries in Europe and North America at the same latitude, such strong heavy rains are relatively rare. In addition, in the southeastern coastal areas, typhoon rainfall also occupies an important position in the distribution of annual rainfall. In some areas along the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong, the amount of rainfall in July and August is closely related to the typhoons that make landfall.

    China's monsoon rainfall not only varies greatly in region and time within a year due to the influence of monsoon activity, but also because the strength of the winter and summer monsoons themselves and the dates of their advance and retreat and the length of their duration vary greatly due to various influences, the changes in precipitation in China from year to year are also quite significant. According to statistics, the average relative variability of annual rainfall in most areas of China is generally between 15 and 25 percent, while the maximum variability is mostly above 40 percent. The difference between the absolute maximum annual precipitation and the absolute minimum annual precipitation in various places is very large. For example, the year with the most rainfall in Beijing was 1959, reaching 1,406 millimeters, while the year with the least rainfall was 1891, with only 168.5 millimeters, a difference of more than eight times. The interannual variation of monthly rainfall is even more prominent than that of annual rainfall. For example, the maximum rainfall in July during the peak summer rainy season in Beijing reached 825 millimeters in July 1890, while the minimum in July 1869 was only 6.8 millimeters. It can be seen how great the influence of the changes in the strength of monsoon activity on rainfall in China is.

    Common Drought and Flood Disasters in China

    The distribution of rainfall in China is still beneficial to agricultural production, especially in the hot summer, the vigorous growing season for various crops, when most of the rainfall is concentrated during this period. "Hot winds and summer rains" is the greatest advantage of China's climate. However, on the other hand, the uneven distribution of rainfall in China regionally and temporally and the excessive interannual variation, as well as the instability of rainfall, are the main reasons for the formation of drought and flood disasters in China.

    From the perspective of the frequent occurrence of some large-scale droughts and floods in the major agricultural areas of China over the years, it is also consistent with the above reasons.

    In the north, especially in the areas of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, and the Northeast Plain, spring droughts are frequent. In addition to frequent heavy rains, floods, and waterlogging in midsummer, there are also many opportunities for summer droughts due to prolonged periods of little rain during the rainy season. In the areas of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and southern Jiangsu and Anhui in the south, flood disasters caused by continuous and concentrated heavy rains in late spring and early summer occur from time to time; and during midsummer, varying degrees of summer droughts occur almost every year. In the southwest and south China, there is little precipitation in winter and early spring, and winter droughts and spring droughts often occur. In May and June in South China, and in July and August in Southwest China, heavy rain and flood disasters often occur. In some areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Hunan, continuous rain often occurs in autumn. In the southeastern coastal areas, during the peak season of typhoon activity in summer and autumn, there are varying degrees of wind and rain disasters every year. As for the agricultural areas in the northwest, except for areas irrigated by snowmelt, drought is the main obstacle to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. According to the ratio of rainfall to evaporation in various parts of China, the dryness and frequency of wetness and dryness are calculated, and the frequency of drought occurrence in various parts of the country is obtained from this. The results are also consistent with the occurrence of drought in various periods and places mentioned above.

    The above-mentioned common drought and flood disasters refer to the occurrence under the average rainfall distribution. As for the specific situation of each year, it depends on the characteristics of monsoon activity and the distribution of rainfall in that year. For example, during midsummer, in years when the summer monsoon is weaker than normal and the winter monsoon is too strong, it is often easy to cause the monsoon rain belt to stagnate in the Jianghuai area and be unable to move north for a long time, thus creating a situation of flooding in the south and drought in the north. The great flood in the Jianghuai River basin in 1954 and the summer drought in some areas of North China last year were like this. Conversely, if the summer monsoon is too strong and the rain belt lasts for a long time in the north, on the one hand, severe summer droughts are prone to occur in Jiangnan, and heavy floods often occur in the north. The persistent summer drought in Jiangnan in 1959 and the great flood in the North China Plain in 1963 occurred under such circumstances. The same is true from the perspective of typhoon disasters. In years when typhoons make landfall frequently, such as 1960 and 1961, the wind and rain disasters will be more severe. Conversely, the impact will be lighter. As for a year without any typhoons making landfall, it has never happened. It should also be noted that typhoon rain accounts for a large proportion of rainfall in the areas it affects. If there is not even one typhoon making landfall in a year, drought will occur during the typhoon activity season.

    Historical Occurrence of Flood and Drought Disasters in China

    Due to these geographical and climatic characteristics, coupled with the limitations of historical conditions and social reasons, flood and drought disasters in various parts of China have been recorded throughout history. According to historical records, from the beginning of the era to the 19th century, there were a total of 1,013 major droughts and 658 major floods, an average of 88 flood and drought disasters per century. Moreover, the frequency of disasters changes over time. From the perspective of flood and drought disasters in Hebei Province, they have become more frequent in modern times. During the period from the late Qing Dynasty to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, floods occurred almost every year; droughts occurred an average of seven times in ten years. It can be seen that flood and drought disasters in China are historical and serious.

    Judging from the rainfall records of the past sixty years of the 20th century, large-scale droughts and floods have occurred no fewer than thirty or forty times, which is still very frequent, and the regional and temporal distribution of droughts and floods is very uneven. Since the 1930s, the number of floods in the Jianghuai River basin has been less than in the previous thirty years. A total of three major flood years occurred in the thirty-two years from 1933 to 1964, while nine major flood years occurred in the thirty-two years from 1901 to 1932, which is three times that of the latter thirty-two years. Conversely, in the latter thirty-two years, there were seven flood years in the North China region in summer, while only two flood years occurred in the former thirty-two years, which is more than three times that of the former thirty-two years. It can be seen that the trend of large-scale drought and flood changes in China in the past sixty years is roughly that there were more floods in the south and droughts in the north in the early stage, while floods in the north and droughts in the south were more common in the later stage. This change may be part of climate change.

    After liberation, historical conditions changed, and the social causes of disasters were eliminated. However, although a large amount of water conservancy construction has been carried out since the founding of the country, which has greatly promoted agricultural production, natural disasters of varying degrees occur almost every year, among which drought and flood are the most prominent. In the sixteen years since the founding of the country, the years with relatively serious flood and drought disasters and the main disaster-stricken areas include: the summer flood in the Haihe River basin in 1949; the summer flood in the Huaihe River basin in 1950; the summer flood in the Yangtze River basin in 1954; the summer flood in the Jianghuai River basin in 1956; the summer flood in the northeast and the summer and autumn drought in the Huaihe River basin in 1957; the summer drought in Jiangnan in 1958; the summer drought in the Jianghuai River basin, the spring flood in South China, and the summer flood in North China in 1959; the spring drought in North China and the summer drought in Central China in 1960 and 1961; the spring drought in South China and the summer flood in North China in 1963, etc., and the summer drought in North China and the summer flood in the Huaihe River basin in 1965 were also relatively obvious.

    The three consecutive years of natural disasters from 1959 to 1961 were the most serious, causing huge losses to China's agricultural production. In 1959, the total precipitation in thirteen provinces and regions in central China from July to September was 30 to 80 percent less than normal. Some areas, such as parts of Hubei, Anhui, and Henan provinces, were continuously affected by drought in the summers of 1960 and 1961. In the winter wheat producing areas in the north, there was a continuous lack of rain for ten months from September 1959 to June 1960. In April, when winter wheat was jointing and heading, the rainfall was 70 to 90 percent less than normal. In 1961, this area was severely lacking in rain during the key period of winter wheat growth and suffered continuous damage, which had a great impact. Although the flood disasters in these three years were not as prominent as droughts, the disaster situation in some areas was also serious. For example, the great flood in the Pearl River basin in June 1959 was unprecedented in nearly a hundred years; in July and August of the same year, heavy rains in northern North China caused disasters. In May and June 1961, the Jiangnan area also suffered some flood disasters due to excessive concentration of heavy rains; in July, northwestern Shandong suffered from heavy rain after suffering from severe drought, forming a flood disaster; after autumn, continuous rain seriously affected the local autumn harvest and autumn planting in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou. In addition, typhoon disasters and freezing damage were also very serious in these three years. There were eleven typhoons making landfall in China's coastal areas in 1960 and 1961, which was four to five times more than the normal average, and were the two years with the most typhoons making landfall after liberation. Because the typhoons made landfall during the key period when local crops were most afraid of strong winds and heavy rains, agricultural production in coastal provinces was greatly damaged. In addition to the above-mentioned severe drought and flood disasters, temperature changes in these three years were also more abnormal than in previous years. The winter temperature was higher than in previous years, and the spring temperature was lower than in previous years. The phenomenon of cold weather in spring was very obvious. Overwintering crops developed and grew earlier, thus suffering from spring frost damage. For example, in March and April 1960, two consecutive strong cold waves invaded, and the temperature dropped sharply across the country, causing severe spring cold weather, which caused serious rotten seedlings in the double-cropping early rice in Jiangnan due to the influence of low temperature and continuous rain.

    According to incomplete data analysis, the three consecutive years of serious natural disasters like 1959 to 1961 are rare in history. For example, since the 16th century, super droughts similar to those in 1960 have only occurred twice, namely in 1640 (the thirteenth year of Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty) and 1877 (the third year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). In history, there have been many instances of continuous droughts. Since 1900, there have been eight times when large-scale droughts occurred for two consecutive years, averaging once every seven to eight years; there have been three times when droughts occurred for three consecutive years (1934 to 1936, 1939 to 1942, 1959 to 1961), averaging about once every twenty years. The once every twenty years mentioned here only refers to an average situation in the past sixty years, and does not mean that it will inevitably occur once every twenty years. In fact, among the three consecutive three-year droughts that have occurred in this century, there were only two years between the first and second times, while there were sixteen years between the second and third times, and all three were concentrated in the second half of the past sixty years.

    As for years with relatively normal climatic conditions, even if most areas have evenly distributed rainfall and are relatively timely, there is still the possibility of local drought and flood disasters. Taking 1952 and 1964, which had relatively normal climate since the founding of the country, as examples: In 1952, some areas of the winter wheat producing areas in the north in spring, and a few areas in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in summer, still had droughts, and the typhoon disasters in local areas of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces in July were also relatively heavy; the rainfall in most areas of China was relatively even in the summer of the year before last, but during the midsummer period, the rain floods in some areas of Hebei and the summer droughts in some areas of Hunan and Jiangxi were still relatively heavy.

    All of the above-mentioned situations show that in a country as vast and with such complex natural conditions as China, drought and flood disasters occur every year due to natural causes. This is an objectively existing phenomenon. Although the scope and extent of drought and flood disasters vary from year to year due to long-term and short-term climate changes, in addition to large-scale serious droughts and floods that occur in a few years with abnormal climate, the phenomenon of small droughts in local areas is still inevitable even in normal climate, and even in years when most areas have good weather. Judging from the situation in various years since the founding of the country, there has not been a year when there have been no drought and flood disasters across the country.

    Today, when it is still impossible for human power to completely control natural conditions, we must not have any侥倖 psychological in the struggle against drought and flood disasters. We must estimate whether there may be disasters or not, whether drought or flood disasters will occur, whether the disasters will be large or small, and we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching, think of the worst possibility and strive for the best result. We must be prepared for the attack of natural disasters at any time, and even in the case of good weather, we must make preparations for disaster prevention and mitigation, so as to be prepared for any eventuality. Only when we have sufficient ideological and material preparations for possible natural disasters can we be invincible in the face of natural disasters such as droughts and floods.

    我国气候和旱涝灾害
    卢鋈
    这篇文章指出：由于自然的原因，我国每年都会有旱涝灾害发生。即使大部分地区雨水调匀，仍然有局部地区发生旱涝。近六十年内，发生大范围的旱涝已不下三四十次，连续两年或三年干旱的情形也不少。这篇文章所提供的大量材料说明了一个道理，即在我们这样一个幅员广大、自然条件复杂的国家，做好备荒工作是十分重要的。对于可能发生的旱涝现象，我们必须做好思想上和物质上的准备，不断加强抗灾能力，才能在灾害面前立于不败之地。　编者
    我国发生旱涝灾害的气候背景
    我国位于世界最大陆地——欧亚大陆的东部，东濒世界最大的海洋——太平洋，南北跨寒、温、热三带，疆土十分辽阔，大陆、海洋的热力作用对我国的气候有着极为剧烈的影响，大部分地区盛行季风，四季寒暖干湿分明，是我国气候的基本特点。在冬季，从西伯利亚及北冰洋吹来的偏北风（也称冬季风），控制着我国的大部分地区，气候寒冷、干燥。夏季，来自东南洋面上的偏南风（也称夏季风），自南向北逐步扩展，盛行于我国的东半部，气候以闷热、潮湿为主。春秋季是冬夏季风进退消长的过渡时期，气候比较温和。我国的降水多数都在干湿冷暖相差很大的冬夏季风相互交锋的过程中，因此也称季风雨。在一年内，随冬夏季风的南北推移和其强度的变化，而决定我国降水在地区上和时间上的分配情况。
    我国一年内降水的分配，无论在地区上或时间上都有很大的差异。从地区看，由于造成我国大规模季风降雨的水汽主要来自东南海洋，北方纬度较高，距东南海洋较远，当南方暖湿空气长途跋涉到达北方以后，水汽已消耗殆尽，所以越往北、往西伸入内陆，降水就越少；在长江以南地区年雨量一般为一千到二千毫米，到华北、东北平原就只有五百到一千毫米了，西北多数地区则在三百毫米以下。从时间看，大部分地区一年内约有百分之五十的雨水下在冬夏季风交锋活跃的夏季三个月里，冬季降水量则占全年的百分之十左右。我国南方由于季风雨出现得早，退得迟，一年内雨带来回两次经过，雨水集中在夏季的现象尚不很显著，春秋季降水相当丰沛，有的甚至超过夏季。越到北方，由于夏季风到得迟、退得早，致使雨季短促，雨水集中的情况十分显著，华北平原一些地区夏季降雨量占到全年七到八成，春秋各占一成左右，而冬季尚不到百分之二、三。以北京为例，春夏秋冬四季降水量占全年总量的比例分别为百分之九点四、百分之七十五点三、百分之十三点六、百分之一点七。我国季风降雨的另一特点是降雨强度大、暴雨多，雨季期间的降雨量往往大部分集中下在几次暴雨过程中，因此，即使在雨季期间，也时常出现较长时间少雨或无雨现象。这些情况也以北方比南方明显。在华北平原有些地区每年平均有二到四次暴雨，大部分都发生在七八月份，暴雨量有时要占全年雨量的一半左右。例如石家庄在一九六三年八月上旬一次连续的暴雨过程中降雨量就达七百三十八毫米，占了该年降雨总量的百分之七十点四，而暴雨过后，在同年的八月中下旬两旬总共却仅有十五毫米的降水。在强烈的冬夏季风交锋过程中，我国暴雨的强度往往是很惊人的，一九六三年八月四日，河北邢台獐么公社的二十四小时雨量纪录竟达到八百六十五毫米。虽然这是比较罕见的情况，但日雨量超过二百三百毫米的纪录每年在我国是屡见不鲜的，而在处于相同纬度的欧洲、北美一些国家中，象这样强的暴雨则是比较少的。此外，在东南沿海地区台风降水在年雨量的分配中，也占有重要的地位。象闽粤沿海的一些地区，七八月雨量的多寡与登陆台风有密切的关系。
    我国的季风降水，不仅在一年内因季风活动的影响而在地区和时间上有很大的差异，并且由于各年冬夏季风本身的强弱，进退的日期和持续的长短受各方面的影响而有很大的出入，因此我国的降水在年与年之间的变化同样是相当显著的。据统计我国多数地区年雨量的平均相对变率一般在百分之十五至二十五之间，而最大变率大都在百分之四十以上。各地绝对最大年降水量与绝对最少年降水量之差是十分悬殊的。如北京年雨量最多的一九五九年达一千四百零六毫米，而最少的一八九一年只有一百六十八点五毫米，相差达八倍多。至于月雨量的年际变化较之年雨量更为突出。例如北京盛夏雨季期间七月的最大降水量在一八九○年七月曾达八百二十五毫米，而最少的一八六九年七月却仅有六点八毫米。可以看出，各年季风活动强弱的变化对我国雨量的影响是多么大了。
    我国常见的旱涝灾害
    我国的雨水分配对于农业生产来说还是有利的，特别表现在炎热的夏季，各种农作物生长的旺盛季节，雨量正好大部分都集中在这个时期。“炎风暑雨”是我国气候上的最大优点。然而，另一方面，我国雨量在地区上和时间上的分配过于不均匀以及年际变化过大，降雨量的不稳定，则是形成我国旱涝灾害的主要原因。
    从历年来我国主要农业地区经常出现的一些大范围旱涝的情况看，也是与上述的原因相一致的。
    在北方，特别是晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕及苏皖北部地区和东北平原一带，春旱频繁，盛夏除常有暴雨、洪水、内涝外，雨季期间长期少雨，出现夏旱的机会也不少。南方的鄂、湘、赣、浙及苏皖南部一带，晚春初夏之际，连续集中暴雨造成的洪涝灾害，时有发生；而盛夏期间，几乎年年都出现不同程度的伏旱。西南、华南地区，冬季及早春降水少，往往发生冬干春旱。五六月华南地区，七八月西南地区，又都常患暴雨洪涝灾害。川、黔、陕、鄂、湘部分地区，秋季不时出现连绵阴雨，东南沿海地区，夏秋季台风活动盛期，每年都有不同程度的风雨灾害，至于西北的农业地区，除有雪水灌溉的地区外，干旱是发展农牧业的主要障碍。根据我国各地降雨量与蒸发量之比，计算出干燥度和干湿频率，并从中求出全国各地干旱出现的频率，其结果也与前述各地各时期发生干旱的情况相符。
    上述常见的旱涝灾害系指在平均雨量分布下的出现情况，至于各年的具体情形，又要视该年季风活动的特点和雨量分布的情况而定。例如：盛夏期间，夏季风比常年弱而冬季风过强的年份，则往往易使季风雨带停滞江淮一带，迟迟不能北上，从而造成南涝北旱的局面。象一九五四年江淮流域的大水，去年华北一些地区的夏旱，就是如此。反之，如夏季风过强，雨带在北方持续长久，则一方面江南容易发生严重的伏旱，而北方也往往发生较重的洪涝。象一九五九年江南持久的伏旱，和一九六三年华北平原的大水，就是发生在这种情况下。从台风灾害看也是如此，在台风登陆次数多的年份，如一九六○、一九六一年，则遭受风雨灾害就要重些，反之，影响会轻些，至于一年内从无登陆台风为害，还不曾有过。而且还要看到，台风雨在其影响地区的降雨量中占有很大的比重，如果一年内一次登陆的台风也没有，则又会在台风活动季节里发生干旱了。
    我国历史上的水旱灾害出现情况
    由于地理上和气候上的这些特点，再加上历史条件的限制和社会原因，自古以来，我国各地的水灾旱灾，史不绝书。根据历史文献的记载，自纪元初至十九世纪期间，共出现过大旱一千零十三次，大水六百五十八次，平均每世纪有水旱灾八十八次。而且受灾的频率是随着时间而改变的。从河北省的旱涝灾害来看，愈到近代愈为频繁。在清末到国民党反动统治的一段时期，水灾几乎每年一次；旱灾在十年中平均有七次。可见我国的旱涝灾害是具有历史性的，而且也是严重的。
    从二十世纪近六十年的雨量纪录看，大范围的旱涝现象也不下三四十次，仍然很频繁，而旱涝出现的区域和时间分布很不均匀。本世纪三十年代以来，江淮流域出现洪涝的次数就比前三十年少。在一九三三到一九六四的三十二年内共出现了三个大涝年，而一九○一到一九三二的三十二年内却出现了九个大涝年，为后三十二年的三倍。相反，在后三十二年内，华北地区夏季却出现了七个涝年，而前三十二年只出现了两个涝年，为前三十二年的三倍多。可以看出，在最近六十年内，我国大范围旱涝变化的趋势，大致是前期南涝北旱较多，而后期则以北涝南旱居多。这种变化可能是气候变动的一部分。
    解放以后，历史条件改变了，引起灾害的社会原因消除了，但建国以来虽然进行了大量的水利建设，对农业生产起着很大的促进作用，但每年几乎还出现程度不同的自然灾害，其中尤以旱涝最为突出。在建国以来的十六年中，受水旱灾比较严重的年份和主要受灾地区有：一九四九年海河流域的夏涝；一九五○年淮河流域的夏涝；一九五四年长江流域的夏涝；一九五六年江淮流域的夏涝；一九五七年东北的夏涝和淮河流域的夏秋旱；一九五八年江南的伏旱；一九五九年江淮流域的伏旱、华南的春涝和华北的夏涝；一九六○与一九六一年华北的春旱和华中的伏旱；一九六三年华南的春旱和华北的夏涝等，一九六五年华北的夏旱和淮河流域的夏涝也比较明显。
    一九五九到一九六一年连续三年的自然灾害最为严重，使我国的农业生产遭受到巨大的损失。一九五九年，我国中部地区有十三个省区，七到九月总降水量比常年少三到八成。其中有些地区，如湖北、安徽、河南等省的部分地区，在一九六○、一九六一两年夏季又连续受旱。在北方冬小麦产区，从一九五九年九月到一九六○年六月，连续十个月缺雨，在冬小麦拔节到抽穗的四月份，雨量比常年少七到九成。一九六一年，这一地区在冬小麦生长的关键时期，又严重缺雨，连续受害，影响很大。这三年的洪涝灾害，虽不象干旱那么突出，但部分地区的灾情也是严重的，如一九五九年六月，珠江流域的大水，就是近百年来所没有过的；同年七八月间华北北部暴雨成灾。一九六一年五六月份，江南一带由于暴雨过于集中，也受到部分洪涝灾害；七月山东西北部在苦旱之后，又连遭暴雨侵袭，形成涝灾；入秋之后，在陕、川、湘、黔一带，阴雨连绵，严重影响了当地的秋收秋种。此外，这三年中，台风灾和冻害也很严重。一九六○年和一九六一年在我国沿海登陆的台风各有十一次，比常年平均多四到五次，是解放后登陆台风最多的两年。由于台风登陆时，正值当地农作物最怕狂风暴雨的关键时期，所以沿海各省农业生产受到很大损害。除上述严重旱涝灾害外，这三年中气温变化也较往年反常，冬季温度较往年偏高，春季温度较往年偏低，倒春寒现象十分明显，越冬作物提前发育生长，从而遭到春霜冻害。如一九六○年三、四月份，连续有两次强大寒潮侵袭，全国普遍急剧降温，引起严重的倒春寒，使江南的双季早稻，因受低温阴雨影响，烂秧严重。
    据不完全的资料分析，象一九五九到一九六一年这样连续三年严重的自然灾害是历史上少有的。例如从十六世纪以来，类似一九六○年的特大旱灾，只出现过两次，即一六四○年
  （明崇祯十三年）和一八七七年（清光绪三年）。在历史上，连续受旱的情形还是不少的，从一九○○年起，连续两年出现大范围干旱的有八次，平均每隔七到八年出现一次；连续三年干旱的有三次（一九三四到一九三六，一九三九到一九四二，一九五九到一九六一年），平均二十年左右出现一次。这里所说的隔二十年一次，仅是指近六十年内的一种平均情况，并不是说每隔二十年必然出现一次。实际上本世纪出现的三次连续三年的干旱中，第一次到第二次中间只隔了两年，而第二次到第三次中间却隔了十六年，而且这三次都集中在近六十年的后半期。
    至于在气候条件比较正常的年份，即使大部分地区雨水调匀，比较适时，但仍然有局部旱涝灾害发生的可能。就以建国以来气候比较正常的一九五二年和一九六四年为例：一九五二年，春季北方冬小麦产区的部分地区，和夏季长江中游少数地区，仍然有旱灾，另外七月份浙闽两省局部地区的台风灾害也比较重；前年夏季我国大部分地区的雨水比较调匀，但盛夏期间，河北部分地区的雨涝和湘赣部分地区的伏旱，还是比较重的。
    以上所述种种情况都表明，在我国这样一个幅员广大、自然条件复杂的国家，由于自然的原因，每年都会有旱涝灾害发生，这是客观存在的现象。虽然由于气候的长时期和短时期的变化，每年旱涝灾害出现的范围和程度有所不同，但是，除了在少数气候反常年份会发生大范围的严重旱涝灾外，就是在气候正常，甚至大部分地区风调雨顺的年份，在局部地区发生小旱灾的现象仍是不可避免的。就建国以来的各年情况看，还没有一年是全国一起旱涝灾害都没有发生的年份。
      在今天，在人力还不可能做到完全控制自然条件的时候，我们在同旱涝灾害的斗争中，就不能存在任何侥幸心理。对于可能有灾还是无灾，出现旱灾还是涝灾，灾大还是灾小，都要有所估计，并且一定要按照毛主席的教导，从最坏处着想，向最好处努力。要随时准备自然灾害的袭击，即使在风调雨顺的情况下，也要作好防灾抗灾的准备，作到有备无患。只有在对待可能出现的自然灾害方面有了足够的思想和物质的准备，才可能在一旦出现的旱涝等自然灾害面前，立于不败之地。
