    Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd. Mongkol Na Nakhon, Assistant Representative Abroad of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, held a reception this evening to warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the Patriotic Front of Thailand.

    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and responsible persons from relevant departments, Zheng Senyu, Wang Chuanbin, Wang Jiachong, Yang Yunyu, Li Hua, Fu Dexi, and others were invited to attend the reception.

    Mongkol Na Nakhon spoke at the reception. He said that currently, the struggle of fraternal people around the world for independence, peace, democracy, and a happy life has taken another step forward, and the global culprit, U.S. imperialism, has suffered a series of extremely embarrassing defeats. This is because the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have clearly seen that the enemy uses force to suppress and massacre the people of various countries, so armed struggle has become the main and necessary form of struggle for the people of these regions.

    He said that today, the world situation is very favorable to all oppressed and invaded people, as evidenced by: We have the great People's Republic of China, a loyal friend that is achieving tremendous accomplishments in production and technology, and it provides resolute and selfless support to the struggles of oppressed people around the world. This is an encouraging force for the people of all countries who are struggling against the aggression and oppression of imperialism and its running dogs. We have the Vietnamese people, who possess spiritual atomic bombs and have repeatedly defeated U.S. imperialism. The struggle of the Vietnamese people, as the vanguard of the world's oppressed people, has become a good example for us. Even in the United States, the American people are waging a struggle against the cruel and barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism.

    Mongkol Na Nakhon said that in our Thailand, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs collude to ravage, oppress, trample, plunder, and control us in the economic, political, cultural, and military fields. Therefore, Thailand has become a new type of colony providing raw materials and a market for U.S. imperialism to dump goods, and a military base used to invade neighboring countries. The Thai people live a well-known life of suffering. The patriotic people of Thailand can no longer endure it, and they have taken up arms to fight for the defense of their own lives, rights, and interests.

    He said that the Patriotic Front of Thailand issued a declaration on September 1, 1965, calling on the Thai people to unite closely, strengthen their fighting spirit, and prepare for the struggle to overthrow the traitorous and disastrous ruling system and drive the foreign aggressor, U.S. imperialism, out of our homeland. Only in this way can all patriotic people of Thailand achieve independence, peace, democracy, and a happy life.

    Mongkol Na Nakhon concluded by saying, "We appeal to all patriotic forces in Thailand: Please use your active actions and comprehensive unity and fighting spirit to fight to drive away and overthrow the Thai people's vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its running dogs. We appeal to all patriotic forces: Aim at U.S. imperialism and its running dogs—this vile and dirty thing—no matter which corner they are in, we must take all measures to completely eliminate them. U.S. imperialism is bound to perish, and the Thanom-Praphas dictatorial traitorous government is bound to perish!"

    Liao Chengzhi, in his speech, warmly congratulated the Patriotic Front of Thailand on the great achievements it has made in the year since its founding, and congratulated the Thai people on continuously achieving greater victories in their just anti-American and patriotic struggle. He wished the Patriotic Front of Thailand to rapidly develop and strengthen its own forces under the great banner of anti-American patriotism. Liao Chengzhi believed that the Patriotic Front of Thailand and other Thai parties will, in the new year of 1966, make greater contributions to the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for the defense of peace in Indochina and the defense of world peace.

    Thai writer Kularb Saipradit also spoke at the reception, introducing the growth and strengthening of the Patriotic Front. He said that as the struggle of the Thai people intensifies, the close unity of the people's patriotic forces has unparalleled power. The people's patriotic forces are like a vast ocean, and they will certainly be able to submerge all enemies that appear strong on the surface.

    Also invited to attend the reception were Tran Van Thanh, head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, Koichi Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, Madame Khampheng Boupha, Chairperson of the Lao Women's Union, Galub, Deputy Director of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office, Rewi Alley, a New Zealand peace activist, and American friend Sidney Rittenberg, and others.

    新华社二日讯　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表助理蒙空·纳那空今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝泰国爱国阵线成立一周年。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，有关方面负责人郑森禹、王传斌、王家宠、杨蕴玉、李华、傅德喜等应邀出席了招待会。
    蒙空·纳那空在招待会上讲话。他说，目前，全世界兄弟人民为争取独立、和平、民主和幸福生活的斗争，又向前发展了一步，全世界的罪魁美帝国主义遭到了一系列极为狼狈的失败。这是由于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民已经清楚地看到，敌人是用武力来进行镇压和屠杀各国人民，那么武装斗争就成为这些地区的各国人民的主要和必要的斗争形式了。
    他说，今天，世界的形势对全体被压迫、被侵略的人民是很有利的，它表现在：我们有着正在生产和技术上获得巨大成就的伟大的中华人民共和国这个忠实的朋友，它对全世界被压迫人民的斗争给予坚决的、无私的支持，这对正在与帝国主义的侵略和压迫及其走狗进行斗争的各国人民是一种鼓舞力量。我们有着具有精神原子弹、一次又一次地战胜美帝国主义的越南人民，作为全世界被压迫人民的先锋队的越南人民的斗争，成了我们良好的榜样。即使是在美国，美国人民也正在进行反对美帝国主义的残酷、野蛮罪行的斗争。
    蒙空·纳那空说，在我们的泰国，美帝国主义和它的走狗相勾结，无论是在经济、政治、文化和军事等方面，进行了蹂躏、压迫、践踏、掠夺和控制，因此，泰国就成为向美帝国主义提供原料和商品推销市场的新型殖民地，并且成为用来侵略邻国的军事基地，泰国人民则过着众所周知的种种苦难的生活。泰国的爱国人民再也忍受不下去了，他们拿起武器来为保卫他们自己的生命、权利和利益而进行了斗争。
    他说，泰国爱国阵线在一九六五年九月一日发表了宣言，号召泰国人民紧密团结，增强斗志，为推翻卖国的、窃国殃民的罪恶统治制度和把美帝国主义这个外来的侵略者赶出我们的国土而做好斗争的准备。只有这样，泰国所有爱国的人民，才能够实现独立、和平、民主和幸福的生活。
    蒙空·纳那空最后说，我们向泰国所有的爱国力量呼吁：请用各位的积极行动和全面的团结和战斗精神，为一定要赶走和推翻泰国人民凶恶的敌人、美帝国主义及其走狗而斗争。我们向所有的爱国力量呼吁：对准美帝国主义及其走狗——这只下贱的肮脏的东西，不管它们在那个角落，我们都要采取一切措施来彻底消灭它。美帝国主义一定灭亡，他侬—巴博独裁卖国政府一定灭亡。
    廖承志在讲话中热烈祝贺泰国爱国阵线成立一周年来所取得的很大成就，祝贺泰国人民在反美爱国正义斗争中不断取得更大的胜利。他祝愿泰国爱国阵线在高举反美爱国的大旗下，迅速发展壮大自己的力量。廖承志相信，泰国爱国阵线和其他泰国各党派一定会在新的一九六六年里，在反对美帝国主义和保卫印度支那的和平、保卫世界和平的斗争中作出更大的贡献。
    泰国作家古腊·赛巴立也在招待会上讲了话，他介绍了爱国阵线成长壮大的情况。他说，在泰国人民的斗争日益加强的情况下，人民爱国力量的紧密团结具有无比威力，人民爱国力量就象汪洋大海一样，一定能够淹没一切表面上看来象是强大的敌人。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成，在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一，老挝妇女联合会主席贵宁·奔舍那夫人，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处副主任加尔布，新西兰和平人士艾黎，美国朋友李敦白等。
