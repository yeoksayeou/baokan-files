　　New Opera Outperforms Old Opera
　　Chen Huixian
　　This happened in Hebei Brigade, Shashi Commune, Liuyang County, Hunan Province. A well-to-do middle peasant and some “old opera fans” made arrangements to invite an old-style shadow puppet troupe to perform old operas. After dinner, they set up the stage and prepared for the performance.

　　When the news spread, the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade immediately went to the cultural center to discuss countermeasures. The Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League proposed performing some new operas at this time to compete with the old operas. Some people in the cultural center were hesitant, fearing they couldn't beat the shadow puppet troupe, but the majority were very confident. They said: "They are performing feudal old operas, we are performing socialist new operas, we have the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, the truth is on our side. Poor and lower-middle peasants love to watch new operas..." This debate enlightened and encouraged everyone, and they all expressed to the Party Branch: "We must perform, we must perform well, and strive for victory!"

　　Thus, the competing shows began. The shadow puppet show performed "Xue Gang Rebels Against the Tang," while the cultural center performed "Poor Peasant Representative." The two stages faced each other, separated only by a main road. At this time, the well-to-do middle peasant and some “old opera fans” became somewhat complacent, saying: "Opera should be colorful and lively. In new operas, no one wears robes or armor, what's there to see? Today we must beat the cultural center."

　　"Xue Gang Rebels Against the Tang" began. Several shadow puppet artists showed off their singing skills, eager to gain the "upper hand" tonight. However, when "Poor Peasant Representative" started, the drums boomed, the gongs clanged, and it depicted the new people and new events in the countryside, singing the innermost thoughts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. As a result, the audience under the shadow puppet stage became restless, and the commune members walked away to watch the new opera at the cultural center. Despite the shadow puppet artists singing at the top of their voices, they couldn't keep the audience. Many poor peasant youths said as they walked: "It's better to watch new operas, new operas are practical, they are all about new people and new events, watching them can be educational." Fewer and fewer people remained under the shadow puppet stage, and in the end, only the well-to-do middle peasant and a few “old opera fans” were left. Seeing that the situation was not in their favor, the shadow puppet artists "retreated and hastily concluded," hurriedly packed their boxes and joined the crowd to watch the new opera.

　　For a time, the new opera stage was bustling with activity, songs, laughter, and applause constantly erupted, and the audience watched with great interest. Deng Dazhi, a seventy-two-year-old poor peasant, cheered loudly. He said: "I don't like watching old operas, they are all about emperors, generals, and ministers, with bulging eyes and upturned mouths, scaring poor people. Poor people only bow and scrape, suffering oppression, the more you watch, the angrier you get. New operas are so good! They are all about our own affairs, easy to understand, and boost the morale of the poor with every performance, the more you watch, the more satisfying it is." (Attached picture)

    新戏比垮了旧戏
    陈辉先
    事情发生在湖南省浏阳县沙市公社河背大队，有个富裕中农和几个“旧戏迷”商量好，请来一个老式皮影班想演旧戏，吃过晚饭，搭好戏台，准备演出。
    消息传开了，大队党支书立即到文化室来研究对策。团支部副书记提议在这时候唱几出新戏，跟旧戏比一比。文化室有些人在犹豫，怕赛不过皮影班，绝大部分人却很有信心，他们说：“他们演封建的旧戏，我们演社会主义新戏，有党的领导，有群众的支持，真理在我们这边。贫下中农是爱看新戏的。……”这场争论使大家得到了启发，受到鼓舞，一齐向党支部表示：“我们一定演，一定演好，争取胜利！”
    对台戏就这样唱起来了，皮影戏唱《薛刚反唐》，文化室演《贫农代表》，两台相对，只隔一条大路。这时，那个富裕中农和一些“旧戏迷”有些得意忘形了，他们说：“戏，就要花花绿绿，热热闹闹。演新戏，一不穿袍，二不着甲，有什么看头。今天我们一定要搞赢文化室。”
    《薛刚反唐》出场了，几个皮影艺人卖弄演唱技巧，一心想在今晚占个“上风”。可是《贫农代表》开演了，鼓声咚咚，锣声锵锵，演的是农村中的新人新事，唱的是贫下中农的心里话。这样皮影戏台下乱了，社员纷纷走开去看文化室的新戏。尽管皮影艺人放开嗓门唱，观众也留不住。好些贫农青年边走边说：“还是去看新戏好，新戏演得实际，都是新人新事，看了能受到教育。”皮影戏台下的人越来越少，最后只剩下了那个富裕中农和“旧戏迷”几个人。皮影艺人一看台下风声不对，来了个“偃旗息鼓，草草收兵”，急忙收拾箱担，也挤在众人后面来看新戏。
    一时新戏台下熙熙攘攘，歌声，笑声，掌声不断，观众看得津津有味，七十二岁的贫农邓大志高声喝采。他说：“我才不喜欢看旧戏，尽是些帝王将相，鼓眼翘嘴，吓唬穷人。穷人光作揖打拱，受人欺压，越看越气人。新戏多好呀！都是演的我们自己的事，看得懂，并且出出为穷人长志气，越看越过瘾。”（附图片）
