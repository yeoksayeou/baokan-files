    U.S. Nuclear-Powered Ships Enter Hong Kong to Show Off Military Might and Engage in War Blackmail
    Hong Kong Public Sternly Condemns American Imperialist Provocative Actions
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 29th (by dispatch) – According to Hong Kong newspapers, Rear Admiral Miller, commander of the U.S. Third Carrier Division, and Captain Holloway, captain of the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier “Enterprise,” brazenly held a so-called “press conference” on the “Enterprise” on the morning of the 28th, “inviting” reporters from some Hong Kong newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations to view this nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that participated in the invasion of Vietnam.
    According to reports, Miller and Holloway shamelessly said in response to reporters’ questions that the aircraft of this aircraft carrier had “sortied (over Vietnam) several times” “under the command of the Seventh Fleet Commander.” They also boasted to Hong Kong reporters that this aircraft carrier possessed all-weather fighters with "world records for maintaining the flight speed of combat aircraft," could "highly effectively support ground operations," had "half more military ammunition reserves than ordinary aircraft carriers," and "could also carry nuclear weapons."
    The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier “Enterprise” arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 26th. That afternoon, another U.S. nuclear-powered cruiser, the “Bainbridge,” also arrived in Hong Kong. A large number of U.S. warships are currently stationed in Hong Kong waters. Although Hong Kong residents have expressed great anger at these U.S. warships, which participated in the slaughter of the Vietnamese people, for coming to Hong Kong, they are still lingering in Hong Kong and even blatantly showing off their military might to Hong Kong residents. Obviously, this is U.S. imperialism unscrupulously engaging in war intimidation and provocation. Relevant people here have severely condemned this naked crime of nuclear blackmail by U.S. imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 29th – Heads of some social organizations and well-known figures in Hong Kong yesterday issued statements condemning the U.S. nuclear-powered warships “Enterprise” and “Bainbridge” for freely entering Hong Kong, seriously threatening the safety of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents.
    Hong Kong's *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* today published statements by Chen Yaocai, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, Yang Guang, director, Gao Zhuoxiong, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Kuancheng, vice chairman, Chen Pishi, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, and Fei Yimin, director of *Ta Kung Pao*, and others. They pointed out that the U.S. nuclear-powered warship “Enterprise” participated in the war of aggression against Vietnam, stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, and committed heinous crimes. Just as U.S. imperialism is attempting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, this U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and the “Bainbridge” nuclear-powered cruiser have entered Hong Kong, which is a provocative action by U.S. imperialism.
    Chen Yaocai, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and Yang Guang, director, emphasized in their statements that U.S. military aircraft came to Hong Kong last August and crashed in Kowloon, threatening the safety of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents, which has aroused the anger of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. Recently, U.S. Navy sailors came ashore in Hong Kong carrying weapons, assaulting and robbing taxi drivers. The case is still unresolved. Now, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" has come to Hong Kong, which is a serious threat to the safety of workers and the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Chen Yaocai and Yang Guang asked: "Does the British Hong Kong authorities' allowing the U.S. invading army and military aircraft and warships, stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, to frequently come to Hong Kong and use Hong Kong mean allowing Hong Kong to be used as a military base for the U.S. to invade Vietnam and invade China?"
    Fei Yimin, director of *Ta Kung Pao*, said: "U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and others have recently talked a lot about using what small amount of weapons to destroy half of China's cities, industries, and 50 million people, openly engaging in nuclear blackmail against China. What does it mean that these two U.S. nuclear-powered warships have come to China's doorstep at this time?" *Ta Kung Pao* and *Wen Wei Po* also published editorials today, solemnly protesting against U.S. imperialism's use of Hong Kong as a base for its activities to expand its war of aggression. The editorials of these two newspapers pointed out that the frequent activities of U.S. warships and military aircraft in Hong Kong are a threat to the security of China and the safety of Hong Kong residents.

    美国核动力舰开进香港炫耀武力进行战争讹诈
    香港公众严斥美帝挑衅行动
    新华社香港二十九日电  据香港报纸报道，美国第三航空母舰分队司令米勒海军少将和美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”舰长霍洛威上校二十八日早晨公然在“企业号”上举行所谓“记者招待会”，“招待”香港一些报纸、通讯社和电台的记者前去观看这艘参与侵略越南的核动力航空母舰。
    据报道，米勒和霍洛威在答记者问时竟无耻地说，这艘航空母舰的飞机“依照第七舰队司令的命令”，已经“若干次出击（越南）”。他们还向香港记者吹嘘这艘航空母舰拥有“保持作战飞机飞行速度世界纪录”的全天候战斗机，可以“高度有效支援地面作战”，舰上“军火储备比普通母舰增加一半”，而且还“可以载核武器”。
    “企业号”核动力航空母舰是在二十六日上午开到香港的，当天下午，另一艘美国核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”也开到香港。目前有一大批美国军舰停在香港海面。尽管香港居民对这些参与屠杀越南人民的美国军舰来到香港表示极大愤怒，但它们迄今还赖在香港不走，甚至公然向香港居民炫耀武力。显然，这是美帝国主义肆无忌惮地进行战争恫吓和挑衅。这里的有关方面人士纷纷严厉谴责美帝国主义这一赤裸裸的核讹诈罪行。
    新华社香港二十九日电香港一些社会团体的负责人和社会知名人士昨天纷纷发表谈话，谴责美国核动力军舰“企业号”和“班布里奇号”自由开进香港，严重威胁港九居民的安全。
    香港《文汇报》和《大公报》今天刊载了港九工会联合会会长陈耀材、理事长杨光，香港中华总商会会长高卓雄、副会长王宽诚，香港华人革新协会主席陈丕士和《大公报》社长费彝民等人士发表的谈话。他们指出，美国核动力军舰“企业号”参加了侵越战争，沾满了越南人民的鲜血，犯下了滔天罪行。正当美帝国主义妄图扩大侵略越南战争的时候，这艘美国核动力航空母舰和“班布里奇号”核动力巡洋舰又开进香港，这是美帝国主义的一种挑衅行动。
    港九工会联合会会长陈耀材、理事长杨光发表的谈话强调指出，去年八月间，美国军机来港，在九龙坠毁，威胁港九居民的安全，已引起港九同胞的愤怒。最近，美舰水兵在港携械上岸，殴伤并抢劫出租汽车司机，案犹未了，现在，美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”来港，是对港九工人和广大同胞安全的严重威胁。陈耀材和杨光问道：“香港英国当局容许满身沾染越南人民鲜血的美国侵略军和军机舰只频频来港和使用香港，是否意味着容许把香港作为美国侵略越南和侵略中国的军事基地？”
    《大公报》社长费彝民说：“美国国防部长麦克纳马拉等人近日大谈使用什么少量武器毁灭中国半数城市、工业和五千万人口，公然向中国进行核讹诈。这两艘美国核动力军舰在这个时候开到中国的大门口来，这算是什么表示？”《大公报》和《文汇报》今天还发表社论，严正抗议美帝国主义利用香港作为它扩大侵略战争的活动基地。这两家报纸的社论指出，美国军舰军机经常来香港活动，是对中国安全和香港居民安全的一种威胁。
