    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 13th: U.S. President Johnson, in his annual State of the Union address to Congress on the 12th, emphasized that the U.S. "will not retreat" in South Vietnam, "must stay," and that the U.S. will "fight on" no matter how great the risks. Johnson's words thoroughly exposed that the "peace offensive" launched by the U.S. government is entirely a smokescreen to cover up its expansion of the war.

    Johnson devoted a large part of his address to the issue of the war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that the U.S. is "engaged in a cruel and fierce conflict in Vietnam," which is the "central issue of concern" to the U.S.

    He said, "The cup of danger is already full in Vietnam." The Vietnam War is "another major event in the persistent policy pursued by the United States since the end of World War II. The guiding principle of this policy is the interests of the United States."

    Johnson's address once again exposed the robber's face of U.S. imperialism. It is clearly the U.S. that has launched interference and aggression against South Vietnam from afar, crossing oceans, and further expanded the aggression to the North. Johnson, however, said that "North Vietnam decided to conquer (South Vietnam)," and the increasing number of armed personnel "from the North" has "changed the nature of the Vietnam War again." The U.S. "had to take action to repel the escalating aggression" and "show the North our firmness."

    Johnson emphasized that the U.S. must stay in South Vietnam until the so-called "aggression stops." He said the U.S. "must stay" because otherwise it would weaken the "confidence of some (countries) whose path to independence depends largely on U.S. protection," and the U.S. "would have to fight on one piece of land after another—or abandon most of Asia."

    Johnson cried out that before the "peace talk" deception is realized, the U.S. must further expand the war. On the one hand, he hypocritically said that the U.S. "will try to limit the conflict" and "does not want greater danger," while at the same time emphasizing that "we will fight on," and "we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, every dollar and every decision—no matter what the cost, no matter what the challenge." To expand the war, the address revealed that the U.S. will increase its war expenses in Vietnam by 5.8 billion dollars in the next year. Moreover, "if the needs of Vietnam require it, I will not hesitate to return to Congress to ask for greater appropriations and more revenue."

    When talking about the "peace talk" issue, Johnson repeated the worthless clichés of the U.S. fourteen-point proposal, and said that the U.S. "will commit to achieving a ceasefire now, or at the beginning of the discussions. If the other side reduces the use of force, we will respond."

    Johnson also pointed out that in order to promote the U.S.'s "peace talk" deception, U.S. officials visited more than 40 countries. The U.S. has held "talks" with the governments of more than 100 countries, and the U.S. has notified the United Nations, requesting member states to provide assistance. He said that the U.S.'s actions have "gained understanding and support" in some countries, and they are with the U.S. "waiting for developments leading to peace." However, Johnson had to admit that so far there is no evidence that the U.S.'s activities have been successful. He said grimly, "We may have to face a long, arduous battle."

    Johnson brazenly engaged in war blackmail against the heroic Vietnamese people and the Chinese people who have made all preparations, saying, "It must now be very clear to others that the choice is not either peace or victory, but either peace, or the catastrophe of a conflict in which they will only suffer defeat."

    The address talked about the five "principles" of the U.S. government's aggression and war policy to dominate the world. He said that the "first principle" of the "policy line" of U.S. foreign policy is "strength." The address said, "In the next fiscal year, we will need an expenditure of $58.3 billion to maintain this necessary strength," which is $6.7 billion more than the direct military expenditure Johnson proposed at the beginning of last year in the budget address for the 1966 fiscal year.

    The address said that the "second principle" of U.S. "policy" is to "vigorously promote existing proposals for arms control and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and seek new proposals." That is to say, to continue to make deals with the Soviet Union on these issues to maintain the nuclear hegemony of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In other parts of the address, Johnson also emphasized that the U.S. should find ways to expand trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries and build "bridges to Eastern Europe." He said, "I will ask Congress to authorize the removal of special tariff restrictions that impede the increase of trade between East and West."

    The address said, "The third important principle of our foreign policy is to help build" so-called "national alliances." In this regard, he mentioned strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is in a state of disintegration, the notorious "Alliance for Progress" program, and the aggressive tool controlled by the United States—the United Nations. The "fourth enduring element" of U.S. foreign "policy" listed in the address is the implementation of the "foreign aid program." In this regard, the address tried to use flowery words to cover up the plundering and aggressive nature of this program.

    The address shamelessly said that the U.S. "supports national independence," and this is the "fifth, and most important, principle" of U.S. "foreign policy." In order to divert the target of the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of all countries, the address tried its best to dress up the U.S. as advocating "ending colonial rule" and opposing "racial oppression." However, with Johnson intensifying the suppression of blacks at home and colluding with old colonialism and pursuing neo-colonialism abroad, these deceptive lies can only further expose the extreme hypocrisy of the Johnson administration.

    However, Johnson had to admit in his address that the aggression carried out by the U.S. around the world, especially the war in South Vietnam, is encountering a series of difficulties. The address admitted that the U.S. aggression against Vietnam has not only been severely hit by the Vietnamese people, but also in domestic issues, "because of the Vietnam issue, we cannot do all the things we should do or want to do."

    The address pointed out that mainly due to the surge in war expenses in Vietnam, the total budgetary expenditure of the U.S. federal government in the 1967 fiscal year will increase to an unprecedented peak of 112.8 billion U.S. dollars.

    The address also talked about the "danger of inflation" aggravated by the war of aggression against Vietnam. The address admitted that "inflation will increase the cost of living and reduce the savings of every family." In order to alleviate the increasingly intensified class struggle and the struggle against racial oppression in the U.S., Johnson once again offered empty promises in his address, such as "waging war on poverty," "guaranteeing legal equality for all people," and building a "great society." Even some U.S. senators admitted that Johnson's empty "great society" plan is nothing more than cheap propaganda for hunting votes in the congressional election year.

    美国总统国情咨文充分暴露了和谈骗局是扩大侵略的烟幕
    约翰逊叫嚷美国要在南越留下来打下去
    承认美国侵略和战争政策在世界各地遭到重重困难
    据新华社十三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十二日在向国会提出的一年一度的国情咨文中强调，美国在南越“决不退让”，“一定要留下来”，并且不论风险多大，美国将“打下去”。约翰逊的这番话，彻底暴露了美国政府发动的“和平攻势”，完全是掩盖它扩大战争的一种烟幕。
    约翰逊在咨文里用很大篇幅谈到侵越战争问题。他说，美国“正在越南进行一场残酷而激烈的冲突”，这是美国“所关心的中心问题”。
    他说，“危险之杯在越南已经装得满满的了”。越南战争是美国“自第二次世界大战结束以来坚持不懈地奉行的政策中的另一件大事。这种政策的准绳就是美国的利益”。
    约翰逊的咨文再一次暴露了美帝国主义的强盗面目。明明是美国不远万里，远渡重洋对南越发动了干涉和侵略，并进而把侵略扩大到北方，约翰逊却说什么“北越决定（对南越）进行征服”，“来自北部的”越来越多的武装人员渗透使
  “越南战争的性质再次起了变化”。美国“有必要采取行动来击退日益加剧的侵略”，“向北部表明我们的坚定态度”。
    约翰逊强调，美国在南越一定要留到所谓“侵略停止”。他说，美国“一定要留下来”，否则，就会削弱“一些其独立的道路在很大程度上依靠对美国保护的（国家的）信心”，美国“将不得不在一个国土上、并接着在另一个国土上作战——或者放弃大部分的亚洲”。
    约翰逊叫嚷，在“和谈”骗局实现之前，美国要进一步扩大战争。他一方面伪善地说美国“将尽力把冲突限制住”，“不希望有更大的危险”，同时又强调“我们将战斗下去”，“我们将使我们的战斗人员得到他们必须得到的东西：每一支枪、每一块美元和每一个决定——不管费用多大，也不管挑战多大”。为了扩大战争，咨文透露，美国下一年度的侵越战费将增加五十八亿美元。而且，“如果越南的需要有所要求，我将毫不迟疑地回到国会要求更大的拨款和更多的收入”。
    约翰逊在谈到“和谈”问题时，重复了不值一文的美国十四点主张的陈词滥调，并且说，美国“将致力于现在就实现停火，或者在讨论一开始的时候就实现停火。如果对方减少使用武力，我们将作出反应”。
    约翰逊还指出，为了推行美国的“和谈”骗局，美国的官员访问了四十多个国家。美国同一百多个国家的政府进行了“会谈”，美国通知了联合国，要求会员国进行帮助。他说，美国的行动在某些国家“得到了谅解和支持”，它们同美国一道
  “在等待着导向和平的发展”。但是，约翰逊不得不承认，迄今还没有证据证明美国的活动是否成功。他阴郁地说，“我们可能不得不面对一场长期的、艰苦的战斗”。
    约翰逊对英勇抗美的越南人民和早已做好一切准备的中国人民放肆地进行战争讹诈，说什么“对别人来说，现在情况必定很清楚，目前的选择不是或则是和平或则是胜利，而是或则是和平，或则是他们只会遭到失败的一场冲突的浩劫。”
    咨文谈到美国政府为了称霸世界而推行的侵略和战争政策的五个“原则”。他说，美国外交“政策路线”的“第一个原则是实力”。咨文说，“在下一个财政年度，我们将需要五百八十三亿美元的开支来保持这种必要的力量”，即比去年年初约翰逊在一九六六财政年度的预算咨文中提出的直接军事开支多六十七亿美元。
    咨文说，美国“政策的第二个原则”是“大力推行关于控制军备和制止核武器扩散的现有建议，并寻找新的建议”，这就是说要在这些问题上继续同苏联作交易，以保持美苏两国的核霸王地位。约翰逊在咨文的其他部分还强调美国要设法扩大同苏联和东欧国家的贸易，建立“通往东欧的桥梁”。他说，“我将要求国会授权取消特别的关税限制，这种限制妨碍东西方增进贸易。”
    咨文说，“我国对外政策的第三个重要原则是帮助建立”所谓“国家联盟”。他在这方面提到要加强陷于分崩离析状态的北大西洋公约组织，声名狼藉的“争取进步联盟”计划以及美国控制的侵略工具——联合国。咨文列举的美国对外“政策的第四个持久的要素”是推行“援外计划”。咨文在这方面力图用一些花言巧语来掩盖这个计划的掠夺和侵略本质。
    咨文无耻地说什么美国
  “支持民族独立”，而且这是美国“对外政策的第五个，也是最重要的原则”。为了转移各国人民的反美斗争目标，咨文竭力把美国打扮成主张“结束殖民统治”，反对“种族压迫”。但是在约翰逊在国内加紧镇压黑人，在国外勾结老殖民主义、推行新殖民主义政策的情况下，这些骗人鬼话只能进一步暴露约翰逊政府的极端伪善。
    然而，约翰逊在咨文里不得不承认，美国在世界各地进行的侵略，特别在南越进行的战争，正遇到一系列困难。咨文承认，美国对越南的侵略不但遭到越南人民沉重打击，而且在国内问题上，“由于越南问题，我们所应该做的事或愿意做的事我们不能全都做到。”
    咨文指出，主要由于侵越战费激增，一九六七财政年度美国联邦政府的预算总开支将增加到一千一百二十八亿美元的空前高峰。
    咨文还谈到由于侵越战争而加剧的“通货膨胀的危险”。咨文承认，“通货膨胀将使生活费用增加而使每个家庭的储蓄减少”。为了缓和美国国内日益加剧的阶级斗争和反对种族压迫的斗争，约翰逊在咨文里又一次开出了所谓要“向贫穷开战”，要“保证全体人民在法律上的平等”，要建立“伟大的社会”等空头支票。连一些美国参议员都承认，约翰逊空洞的“伟大的社会”计划，不过是在国会竞选年为了猎取选票而进行的一种廉价宣传。
