    Not Eating "Ready-Made Meals"
    Many countries have successfully experimented with injecting heavy oil and natural gas into blast furnaces to replace some coke in ironmaking, and have accumulated a set of relatively mature technical experiences. However, some countries have experimented with injecting pulverized coal into blast furnaces, but have encountered various obstacles. When Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Company (Shigang) decided to experiment with the new technology of injecting pulverized coal into blast furnaces, some people suggested taking the old path of injecting heavy oil that foreigners had already taken. They said: Foreigners have already successfully experimented with injecting heavy oil, why not eat the ready-made meal? Later, based on the analysis results of the ironmaking plant and the company's relevant technical personnel, injecting pulverized coal into the furnace can save the country more wealth and can utilize resources nearby than injecting heavy oil. Therefore, although injecting pulverized coal will encounter greater difficulties and risks than injecting heavy oil, they still determined to boldly innovate, take their own path, and finally successfully applied the new technology of injecting pulverized coal into blast furnaces for production.
    Regarding "ready-made meals" in production technology, sometimes we should eat them, and sometimes we should not. Shigang Iron and Steel Plant did the right thing by not eating the "ready-made meal" of injecting heavy oil into blast furnaces that foreigners had already successfully experimented with, but successfully experimenting with injecting pulverized coal, which foreigners had not yet succeeded in. Because, firstly, other people's "ready-made meals" are sometimes not to our "taste," and secondly, if we only eat "ready-made meals," use other people's new technologies, and don't "cook" ourselves, developing our own new technologies, how can we surpass others?

### 不吃“现成饭”

    不吃“现成饭”
    往高炉内喷吹重油、天然气代替部分焦炭炼铁，许多国家已经试验成功，有了一套比较成熟的技术经验；而往高炉里喷吹煤粉，一些国家做过试验，却遇到了种种障碍。石钢决定试验往高炉内喷吹煤粉新技术的时候，有人提出要走外国人已经走过的喷吹重油的老路。他们说：喷吹重油外国人已试验成功了，我们为什么放着现成饭不吃？后来，根据炼铁厂和公司有关技术人员分析的结果：往炉内喷吹煤粉比喷吹重油，可以为国家节约更多的财富，而且可以就近利用资源。因此，虽然喷吹煤粉比喷吹重油会遇到更大的困难和风险，但他们仍然决心大胆创新，走自己的路，终于把向高炉喷吹煤粉的新技术成功地用于生产。
    对于生产技术上的“现成饭”，有时要吃，有时就不能吃。石钢炼铁厂不吃外国已经试验成功的向高炉喷吹重油的“现成饭”，而试验成功外国尚未成功的喷吹煤粉，这就做对了。因为一来别人的“现成饭”，有时并不合我们的“胃口”，二来只是吃“现成饭”，利用别人的新技术，而不自己“造饭”，发展自己的新技术，怎么能超过别人呢？
