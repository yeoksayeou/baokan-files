    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Khai, January 15th: Colonel Thoun, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today: "The Lao people must unite with the Vietnamese people and the people of the world to resolutely smash the Johnson clique's 'peace offensive' and oppose its conspiracy to expand the war of aggression in Indochina."
    Colonel Thoun refuted the Johnson administration's so-called "fourteen-point plan" for solving the Vietnam problem, saying, "Whether it's fourteen points or twenty-four points, the only point should be that it immediately withdraws from South Vietnam."
    He said: "The U.S. imperialists are the murderers of the Vietnamese and Lao people, they are the aggressors. As long as they immediately withdraw all their invading troops and all war materials, peace in this region will be immediately realized."
    He said, "The U.S. imperialists are playing peace tricks, but they just want the South Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and be their slaves forever, and they just want the North Vietnamese people to abandon their struggle to aid their southern compatriots. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Vietnamese people."
    Colonel Thoun condemned the behavior of "leaders of certain major countries who actually applaud the U.S. imperialist peace fraud." He said: The Lao people have long experience in dealing with U.S. imperialism. We understand from our own experience that it is impossible to beg for peace from U.S. imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sana'a, January 12th: Yemeni Minister of Education Qassem Ghaleb told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 11th: "The 'peace negotiations' on the Vietnam issue recently spread by the United States are a fraud, and the United States is trying to deceive world public opinion. If the United States is willing to solve the Vietnam problem, it must withdraw all its troops from Vietnam."
    Ahmed Rueni, Director of Sana'a Radio, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 12th: "All the activities of the United States in the world are a conspiracy, and the United States is trying to continue its military aggression against Vietnam under the guise of fraudulent peace negotiations."
    He pointed out: "What the United States cannot get in war, it cannot get in negotiations. The Vietnamese people will achieve the final victory against U.S. imperialism, because they are not afraid of U.S. imperialism, they are fighting for their national interests and rights."
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 15th: "Minju Choson" published a commentary on the 15th pointing out that U.S. President Johnson's "State of the Union Address" on the 12th was full of lies and turned black and white upside down, fully exposing the true face of the "peace negotiations" shouted by U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue.
    The commentary said that a common feature of the "State of the Union Addresses" of previous U.S. presidents is the use of flowery words and sophistry to cover up the aggressive and anti-people nature of their foreign and domestic policies. The foreign policy part of Johnson's "Address" more concentratedly exposed the U.S. imperialist ambition to dominate the world and its aggressive nature. This fully demonstrates Johnson's arrogance and shamelessness.
    The commentary pointed out that what the Vietnamese people need is not thousands of hypocritical "sincerity," but the U.S. aggressors immediately stopping the war of aggression and immediately getting out of the land of Vietnam.
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 15th: The Cambodian newspaper "New News" published a commentary on the 15th saying that the Americans claim to be willing to negotiate with Vietnam to seek "peace," but they are clenching their fists, ready to secretly attack others. The commentary pointed out that Johnson's "peace talk" conspiracy is to deceive international public opinion.
    "Fatherland" pointed out in a commentary on the 14th that no one believes in the United States' "sincerity for peace" because imperialists are inconsistent in word and deed.
    The commentary said that the United States must abandon its "unconditional negotiation" fraud and consider the four-point propositions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.
    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, January 14th: The Algerian newspaper "El Moudjahid" published a commentary on the 14th on President Johnson's State of the Union Address, saying that this address confirms the failure of the fake "peace offensive" launched by the U.S. State Department.
    The commentary said: President Johnson once again waved the big stick. The State of the Union Address delivered after the United States launched a "peace offensive" can be summarized in one sentence: "We will increase our military strength to end the Vietnam War."
    The commentary pointed out that, in fact, this is putting a knife to the throat of the Vietnamese people.
    Although Johnson "uses diplomatic rhetoric to cover up the war, the reality of the imposed war is becoming increasingly aggressive."
    The Algerian News Agency published a commentary on the 13th, pointing out that Johnson's State of the Union Address is a display of U.S. military strength and an attempt to justify the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The commentary reiterated Algeria's support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. The commentary also expressed unconditional support for the four-point propositions put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. (Attached picture)

    亚非舆论同声谴责约翰逊国情咨文和美国十四点花招
    约翰逊休想诱使南越人民放下武器
    美国必须做的一点是从南越滚出去
    据新华社康开十五日电　老挝爱国中立力量指挥部总指挥敦上校今天对新华社记者发表谈话说：“老挝人民要同越南人民和全世界人民团结起来，坚决粉碎美国约翰逊集团的‘和平攻势’，反对它扩大侵略印度支那战争的阴谋。”
    敦上校驳斥约翰逊政府所谓解决越南问题的“十四点计划”说：“不管它十四点还是二十四点，唯一的一点应该是它立即撤出南越。”
    他说：“美帝是屠杀越南人民和老挝人民的凶手，是侵略者，只要它立即撤走它的全部侵略军和一切战争物资，这个地区的和平就立即实现。”
    他说，“美帝国主义玩弄和平阴谋，不过是想要越南南方人民放下武器、永远作它的奴隶，不过是想使越南北方人民放弃援助他们南方同胞的斗争。这是越南人民绝对不会接受的。”
    敦上校谴责“某些大国领导人竟然为美帝和谈骗局叫好”的行为。他说：老挝人民有长期同美帝国主义打交道的经验，我们从切身的经历中懂得：向美帝国主义乞讨和平是不可能的。
    新华社萨那十二日电　也门教育部长卡塞姆·加利卜十一日对新华社记者说：“美国最近散布的关于越南问题的‘和平谈判’是一个骗局，美国企图欺骗世界舆论。美国如果愿意解决越南问题，它就必须把军队全部撤出越南。”
    萨那电台台长艾哈迈德·鲁埃尼十二日对新华社记者说：“美国在世界上进行的全部活动是一个阴谋，美国企图在骗人的和平谈判下继续对越南进行军事侵略。”
    他指出：“美国在战争中得不到的东西在谈判中也不可能得到。越南人民将取得反对美帝国主义的最后胜利，因为他们不怕美帝国主义，他们是为自己的民族利益和权利而战。”
    据新华社平壤十五日电《民主朝鲜报》十五日发表评论指出，美国总统约翰逊十二日发表的“国情咨文”，从头到尾谎话连篇、颠倒黑白，充分暴露了美帝国主义在越南问题上所叫喊的“和平谈判”的真面目。
    评论说，美国历届总统的“国情咨文”的共同特点，就是用华丽的词句和诡辩来掩盖它们的对外对内政策的侵略性和反人民的本质。约翰逊的“咨文”中的对外政策部分，更集中地暴露出美帝国主义称霸世界的野心和侵略本性。这充分表明了约翰逊的蛮横和厚颜无耻。
    评论指出，越南人民需要的不是成千上万个假惺惺的“诚意”，而是美国侵略者立即停止侵略战争，马上从越南土地上滚出去。
    据新华社金边十五日电柬埔寨《新消息报》十五日发表评论说，美国人声称愿意同越南谈判以谋求“和平”，但是他们紧握拳头，准备秘密进攻别人。评论指出，约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋，是为了欺骗国际舆论。
    《祖国报》十四日在评论中指出，谁也不相信美国的“和平诚意”，因为帝国主义者言行不一致。
    评论说，美国必须抛弃它的“无条件谈判”的骗局而考虑越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    据新华社阿尔及尔十四日电　阿尔及利亚《圣战者日报》十四日就约翰逊总统的国情咨文发表评论说，这篇咨文证实美国国务院大张旗鼓发动的假“和平攻势”失败了。
    评论说：约翰逊总统又一次挥舞大棒。在美国发动“和平攻势”以后发表的这篇国情咨文概括起来却是这么一句话：“我们将增强我们的军事力量，以结束越南战争”。
    评论指出，事实上，这是把刀子放在越南人的脖子上。
    尽管约翰逊“用外交辞令掩饰战争，但是强加于人的战争的现实日益咄咄逼人”。
    阿尔及利亚新闻社十三日发表评论指出，约翰逊的国情咨文是炫耀美国的军事力量，并且企图为美国对越南的侵略战争进行辩解。
    评论重申阿尔及利亚支持越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争。评论还表示无条件地支持越南民主共和国提出的四项主张。（附图片）
    这就是约翰逊的“和平篮子”！
