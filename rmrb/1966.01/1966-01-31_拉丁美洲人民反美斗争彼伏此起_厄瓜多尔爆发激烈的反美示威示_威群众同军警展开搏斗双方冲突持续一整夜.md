    According to Xinhua News Agency, Quito, January 30: Ignoring the authorities' ban, residents of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, held fierce anti-US and anti-dictatorship demonstrations near the US Embassy and in various parts of the city on the 28th. The pro-US dictatorial regime dispatched a large number of military police to suppress the demonstrators, and the conflict between the two sides lasted all night.
    In this demonstration, which was called for "national dignity," the masses waved placards, angrily shouting slogans such as "Down with US imperialism!" and "Down with the dictatorship!" and strongly condemned the so-called "Rio de Janeiro Protocol" imposed by the United States in 1942, which stipulates the border between Ecuador and Peru.
    The emotionally charged masses set off from the Central University, and then, despite the brutal suppression by the police, successively arrived near the US Embassy and the heavily guarded National Palace to hold protest demonstrations, shouting anti-US and anti-dictatorship slogans. When the demonstrators passed the "US-Ecuadorian Center," they attacked the institution with stones. In some places, people also held rallies to denounce the US-backed dictatorial regime.
    During the demonstration, police and mounted police repeatedly launched assaults on the masses and used tear gas. However, the dispersed队伍 (duìwǔ) then regrouped, fully demonstrating the determination of the Ecuadorian people to oppose imperialism and dictatorship without fear of violence.
    According to reports, shops were closed due to the demonstration. An Associated Press dispatch on the 28th also admitted that the atmosphere in Quito was tense.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 29: In the past two or three months, workers, students, and citizens in major cities such as Guayaquil, Loja, and Cuenca in Ecuador have continuously held demonstrations, marches, and rallies, demanding an immediate end to the dictatorial rule of the military junta.
    In mid-November last year, students and citizens of Loja held a large-scale demonstration in the city center. The dictatorial authorities dispatched a large number of military police to suppress the demonstrators, injuring three demonstrators and arresting dozens of people. It was revealed that the suppression was directed by agents of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, the demonstrators bravely fought back with stones and sticks, injuring fourteen policemen armed with tear gas and batons, and burning two government vehicles.
    The day after the anti-US and anti-dictatorship demonstration in Loja, thousands of students from various middle schools in Guayaquil took to the streets to hold a large-scale demonstration, supporting the struggle of the people of Loja and demanding "to drive the agents of US imperialism out of Ecuador."
    At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Ecuadorian workers, students, teachers, and citizens have continuously held strikes, teaching strikes, and class boycotts, opposing dictatorial rule and demanding increased wages and improved living conditions.
    With the continuous upsurge of the people's anti-US and anti-dictatorial struggle, contradictions within the ruling clique have become increasingly acute. On November 29 last year, Air Force Colonel Freile, one of the four members of the military junta, was suddenly removed from his post as a member. After Freile was expelled from the military committee, the Minister of Interior Garcia Velasco and the Minister of Foreign Affairs also resigned from their ministerial posts one after another. Since then, the four-headed military junta has become a three-headed military junta, and the military government, which had just been reorganized in July last year, had to be reorganized again.
    Freile's and various right-wing opposition parties' anti-government activities mark that, facing a strong popular resistance movement, this pro-US dictatorial government is in a state of division and betrayal. Some reactionary forces are engaging in political speculation in order to rule the people at another time and by another method. The military junta recently announced its fifth "constitutional restoration plan." It claimed that it would hold elections on April 1 and hand over power on September 1. However, it has been revealed that because the military junta refused to convene a constitutional assembly and announced that it would conduct elections under its control, it is at best a reproduction of the notorious so-called "representative democracy" trick.

### 拉丁美洲人民反美斗争彼伏此起  厄瓜多尔爆发激烈的反美示威示  威群众同军警展开搏斗双方冲突持续一整夜

    拉丁美洲人民反美斗争彼伏此起
    厄瓜多尔爆发激烈的反美示威示
    威群众同军警展开搏斗双方冲突持续一整夜
    据新华社三十日讯  基多消息：厄瓜多尔首都基多市的居民不顾当局的禁令，二十八日在美国大使馆附近和全市各地区举行激烈的反美、反独裁示威。亲美独裁政权派出大批军警进行镇压，双方之间的冲突持续了一整夜。
    在这次称作为了“民族尊严”的大示威中，群众挥动着标语牌，愤怒高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒独裁政权！”等口号，并且强烈谴责美国在一九四二年强加的规定厄瓜多尔同秘鲁的边界的所谓“里约热内卢议定书”。
    情绪激昂的群众从中央大学出发，接着不顾警察的野蛮镇压，先后到达美国大使馆附近和戒备森严的国民宫举行抗议示威，高呼反美、反独裁口号。示威者经过“美国—厄瓜多尔中心”时，用石块袭击了这个机构。在一些地方，人们还举行集会，痛斥美国扶植的独裁政权。
    在示威过程中，警察和骑警一再向群众发动冲击，并且使用了催泪弹。但是被冲散的队伍接着又集合起来，充分显示了厄瓜多尔人民不畏强暴反帝反独裁的决心。
    据报道，由于这次示威，商店都关上了门。美联社二十八日的消息也承认，基多市内气氛紧张。
    据新华社二十九日讯　近二、三个月来，在厄瓜多尔的瓜亚基尔、乐哈、昆卡这样一些主要城市里，工人、学生和市民不断举行示威游行和集会，要求立即结束军政府委员会的独裁统治。
    去年十一月中旬，乐哈市的学生和市民在市中心举行了大规模示威。独裁当局出动大批军警对示威群众进行镇压，打伤三名示威者，逮捕了好几十人。据揭露，这次镇压是由美国联邦调查局的特务指挥的。但是，示威者用石块和棍棒进行英勇还击，打伤了十四名手持催泪瓦斯和大棒的警察，烧毁了两辆政府的汽车。
    在乐哈举行反美反独裁示威的第二天，瓜亚基尔市各中学的几千名学生又涌上街头举行大规模示威，支持乐哈人民的斗争，要求“把美帝国主义的特务从厄瓜多尔赶出去”。
    岁末年初，厄瓜多尔工人、学生、教员和市民不断举行罢工、罢教和罢课，反对独裁统治，要求增加工资和改善生活条件。
    在人民群众反美反独裁斗争不断高涨的情况下，统治集团内部矛盾日益尖锐化。去年十一月二十九日，军政府委员会四成员之一、空军上校弗雷莱突然被解除了委员的职务。在弗雷莱被逐出军事委员会以后，内政部长加西亚·贝拉斯科和外交部长也先后辞去了部长职务。从此四头军政府委员会变成了三头军政府委员会，而刚刚在去年七月进行了一次改组的军政府也不得不再次进行改组。
    弗雷莱以及各种右派反对党的反政府活动标志了面临强大的人民反抗运动，这个亲美独裁政府已陷于四分五裂、众叛亲离的境地。一部分反动势力在进行政治投机，以便在另外时机、用另外一种手法统治人民。军政府委员会不久前宣布了第五个“恢复宪制计划”。它扬言要在四月一日举行选举，在九月一日交出政权。但是据揭露，由于军政府委员会拒绝召开立宪会议，并且宣布要在它的控制下进行选举，它充其量不过是臭名昭著的所谓“代议制民主”花招的再现。
