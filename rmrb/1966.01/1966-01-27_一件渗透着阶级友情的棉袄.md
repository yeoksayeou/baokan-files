    A Cotton-padded Coat Permeated with Class Friendship
    Bai Ming'er, the head of the Poor Peasants' Association of the Longquan Brigade in the Chengguan Commune of Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, sent a brand new green-lined, blue-faced cotton-padded coat to his class brothers in the disaster area of Lin County on November 21, 1965. This act of providing charcoal in snowy weather is very touching, but behind this matter, there is also a tortuous and moving story.
    Now, let's start with an unsigned letter:
    Dear Class Brothers, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Lin County:
    First of all, I would like to extend my cordial greetings to you! ...
    Now that severe winter has arrived, when I wear a cotton-padded coat, I think of you. After discussing it with my old partner, we decided to send you this gift with great commemorative significance—the cotton-padded coat. Please do not decline it, accept it! "Wearing it on your body, it warms my heart." Let us, under the leadership of the Party, be forever warm as spring and bathed in bright sunshine in the big family of the motherland!
　　　　Your class brother
              November 21, 1965
    Whose cotton-padded coat is this exactly? The matter was originally like this: On December 25, 1964, the *People's Daily* published the news of Bai Ming'er wholeheartedly serving the collective, saying that he went to Jingle County for the team to buy horses and, in order to retrieve a runaway horse, forgot everything about himself. Only when he returned home did he realize that his cotton-padded coat and small package were lost. Soon, a brand new cotton-padded coat was sent to Ming'er from Tianjin City, Hebei Province. After learning about it, it was found that a class brother named Wang Ziqiang from the Yongjiu Factory in Tanggu, Tianjin, had sent the new cotton-padded coat he had prepared to wear. Ming'er regarded this cotton-padded coat as a priceless treasure of communist style and preserved it as a souvenir. This cotton-padded coat further encouraged Bai Ming'er to farm for the revolution day and night. Last November, Bai Ming'er heard County Party Secretary Shi Ping say that Lin County had suffered a serious drought, so he discussed with his old partner and sent the cotton-padded coat to his class brothers. He said: "If we don't support our class brothers when they are in trouble, what kind of poor peasant are we!"

    一件渗透着阶级友情的棉袄
    山西省文水县城关公社龙泉大队贫协主任白明儿，一九六五年十一月二十一日把一件崭新绿里蓝面棉袄，寄给了临县灾区的阶级兄弟。这种雪里送炭的行动，是很感动人的，但在这件事情的背后，却还有一段曲折动人的故事。
    现在，我们就从一封没有记名的信说起吧：
    亲爱的临县贫下中农阶级兄弟们：
    我首先向你们表示亲切的慰问！……
    现在严寒已到，当我穿棉袄的时候，想到了你们，经我和老伴商量，决定将这件具有重大纪念意义的礼物——棉袄，送给你们，请不要推辞，收下吧！“穿在你身上，暖在我心里”，让我们在党的领导下在祖国大家庭里永远温暖如春，阳光灿烂！
　　　　你的阶级兄弟
              一九六五年十一月二十一日
    这件棉袄到底是谁的呢？事情原来是这样：一九六四年十二月二十五日，《人民日报》发表了白明儿全心为集体的消息，说他替队里到静乐县买马回来，为了追回一匹脱缰的马，忘记了自己的一切，回到家里，才想到自己的棉袄和小包丢了。不久，河北省天津市给明儿寄来了一件崭新的棉袄。经过了解，才知道是天津塘沽永久厂一位阶级兄弟，名叫汪自强，把自己准备穿的一件新棉袄寄来了。明儿把这件棉袄看成是共产主义风格的无价之宝，保存下来作为纪念。这件棉袄进一步鼓舞着白明儿不分白天黑夜地为革命而种田。去年十一月，白明儿听县委书记史平说临县遭受了严重旱灾，就和老伴商量把棉袄寄给阶级兄弟。他说：“阶级兄弟有了困难不支援，还象个什么贫农！”
