    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, the Spring Festival comfort delegations organized by people from all walks of life across the country to comfort the People's Liberation Army and the Public Security Forces have recently entered a climax of comfort activities. During the comfort activities held in various places, commanders and fighters expressed to their loved ones with great enthusiasm: In the new year, we will hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, strengthen preparedness for war, and contribute even more to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    On the coastal defense line, many comfort delegation members are currently climbing mountains and crossing rivers and seas, going deep into forward positions, docks, and airports to convey the Party's and the people's concern and greetings to the coastal defense soldiers. The nine sub-delegations of the Fujian Province People's Spring Festival Comfort Delegation, on the eve of the Spring Festival, divided into twenty-three routes, arrived in the coastal areas, no matter how high the mountains or how far the roads, they went to comfort the soldiers wherever they were, bringing the deep feelings of the Party and the people to the heroic soldiers. On the front lines of the South China Sea, the Guangdong Province People's Spring Festival Comfort Delegation separately comforted the Navy, Air Force, and coastal defense forces that had repeatedly won battles in the struggle against the enemy, praising their meritorious service in defending the motherland.
    In the eastern, central, and western sections of the Sino-Indian border, the Tibet and Xinjiang comfort delegations have also been carrying out comfort activities intensely these days. The comfort delegation to the Ali area of Tibet braved the severe cold of minus thirty or forty degrees Celsius and arrived at Gar Kunsha at the foot of the Himalayas. The whole city was jubilant, colorful flags were flying, and the heroic and spirited border defense soldiers greeted their loved ones from afar with great excitement. Members of the comfort delegation, representing the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas, warmly thanked the People's Liberation Army for their help and support, and praised the revolutionary spirit of the border defense soldiers who have been stationed on the border of the motherland year after year, taking the border post as their home and hardship as their glory. The soldiers also repeatedly expressed to their loved ones that in the new year, they would hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and defend the border of the motherland.
    The comfort delegations from Shandong, Sichuan, Qinghai, Anhui, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces have held comfort meetings in recent days to warmly comfort the local garrison troops. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region comfort delegation, led by Wang Yilun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, comforted the soldiers stationed on the grasslands. Some leagues, cities, banners, and counties also organized "Ulan Muqir" style comfort groups to go deep into the high mountains and dense forests to comfort small detachments that have been sticking to their duty posts for many years. Many sub-delegations of the Guizhou Province comfort delegation, during the comfort activities, tirelessly comforted every unit stationed in the area. In Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Ningxia and other places, mass comfort activities are also being widely carried out. Many commune comfort groups, carrying the fruits of their harvest and comfort bags sewn by the members, went to the nearby troop barracks to comfort the commanders and fighters.
    While warmly comforting the commanders and fighters, all comfort delegations earnestly learned from the advanced thinking and excellent revolutionary style of the People's Liberation Army. The fourteen sub-delegations of the Shanghai Municipal comfort delegation, during the comfort period, visited the "Four Good" companies, visited activists in studying Chairman Mao's works and "Five Good" soldiers, and invited political workers and heroic model figures from the troops to introduce their experiences in highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, adhering to the "Four Firsts," and cultivating the "Three-Eight" work style. During the comfort activities, the Tianjin Municipal comfort delegation invited Chen Jinyuan, instructor of the "Model Red Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works," to give a report entitled "Let Mao Zedong Thought Take Root in the Company." The comfort delegations from Jiangsu, Hunan, Shaanxi and other provinces learned as they went, and many members collected a large number of heroic deeds created by the commanders and fighters in various tasks and the experience of the company's ideological work, preparing to bring these good ideas, good styles, and good experiences back to their units to promote ideological revolutionization and welcome a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production.
    Literary and art workers accompanying the comfort delegations in various places enthusiastically performed rich and colorful literary and artistic programs for the officers and soldiers.

    热情慰问解放军　认真学习解放军
    全国各地春节慰问子弟兵活动进入高潮
    据新华社二十三日讯　全国各地各界人民组织的慰问解放军和公安部队的春节慰问团，最近几天，慰问活动进入高潮。在各地举行的慰问活动中，指战员们满怀激情地向亲人们表示：在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，加强战备，为中国人民和世界人民革命事业贡献更大的力量。
    在海防线上，目前，许多慰问团人员正在翻山越岭，跨江过海，深入前沿阵地、码头、机场，向海防战士转达党和人民对他们的关怀和问候。福建省各界人民春节慰问团所属的九个分团，春节前夕，分成二十三路，到达了沿海地区，不管山多高，路多远，那里有战士就到那里慰问，把党和人民的深情厚意带给英雄战士。在南海前线，广东省各界人民春节慰问团分别慰问了在对敌斗争中屡战皆捷的海军、空军和海防部队，表彰他们在保卫祖国事业中立下的功勋。
    在中印边界东段、中段和西段，这几天，西藏和新疆的慰问团也在紧张地进行着慰问活动。赴西藏阿里地区的慰问团，冒着零下三四十度的严寒，到达喜马拉雅山下的噶尔昆沙时，全城欢动，彩旗飘扬，英姿焕发的边防战士怀着十分激动的心情，迎接远道而来的亲人。慰问团成员代表边疆各族人民，热情感谢人民解放军的帮助和支援，赞扬边防战士长年累月坚守祖国边疆，以边卡为家，以艰苦为荣的革命精神。战士们也一再向亲人们表示在新的一年里要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，保卫祖国的边疆。
    山东、四川、青海、安徽、湖北、陕西、山西等省慰问团，最近几天，分别举行慰问大会，热情慰问当地驻军。内蒙古自治区慰问团在自治区党委书记处书记、自治区副主席王逸伦等带领下，慰问了驻守草原的战士，有些盟、市、旗、县还组织了“乌兰牧骑”式的慰问小组，深入高山、密林慰问长年坚守在执勤点上的小分队。贵州省慰问团的许多分团在慰问活动中，不辞辛劳地慰问了驻地的每一个部队。在山东、河北、江苏、浙江、江西、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、宁夏等地，群众性的慰问活动也在广泛展开。许多公社的慰问组带着自己丰收的果实和社员们亲手缝制的慰问袋等到附近部队营区慰问指战员。
    各慰问团在热情慰问指战员的同时，都认真学习解放军的先进思想和优良的革命作风。上海市慰问团的十四个分团，在慰问期间，每到一地，都参观了四好连队，访问了学习毛主席著作积极分子和五好战士，并邀请部队政治工作人员和英雄模范人物，介绍部队突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作、坚持四个第一、培养三八作风等经验。天津市慰问团在慰问活动中，邀请了“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”指导员陈金元，作了题为《让毛泽东思想在连队扎根》的报告。江苏、湖南、陕西等省的慰问团走到那学到那，许多团员搜集了大批指战员们在各项工作中创造的英雄事迹和连队思想工作经验，准备把这些好思想、好作风、好经验带回自己的单位，促进思想革命化，迎接工农业生产新高潮。
    各地随慰问团进行慰问活动的文艺工作者，都热情地为官兵们演出了丰富多采的文艺节目。
