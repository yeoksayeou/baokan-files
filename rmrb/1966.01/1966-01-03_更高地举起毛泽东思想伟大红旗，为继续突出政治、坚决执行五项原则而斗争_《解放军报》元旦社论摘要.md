    In 1965, the entire army held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously gave prominence to politics, and achieved an all-round bumper harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in all aspects of work. Cadres and soldiers studied and applied Chairman Mao's works more effectively than in previous years, their political consciousness was raised higher, and their revolutionary drive was boosted more fully. A large number of good deeds and good people in the style of Lei Feng and Wang Jie emerged, and the "Four Good Companies" movement saw new development. Battles were fought more beautifully, training was conducted more solidly, and various tasks were completed more outstandingly. Our army has taken another significant step on the road of being exceptionally proletarianized and exceptionally combat-ready.
    Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on giving prominence to politics, based on Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, the historical experience of our army, and the current situation, are of great strategic significance. They are fundamental to strengthening the revolutionization and modernization of our army, fundamental to preparing for a war to smash aggression by U.S. imperialism, and fundamental to opposing and preventing modern revisionism and ensuring that our army never changes its nature. Giving prominence to politics is not an arbitrary policy, but a fundamental measure proposed according to the laws of development of socialist society and the economic foundation of socialist society. Socialist society must continuously improve the people's material and cultural life along with the development of production, but it must never engage in material incentives like capitalist society. We mainly rely on political and ideological work to improve people's proletarian consciousness and transform spiritual strength into material strength. Whether or not to give prominence to politics, whether or not to engage in the ideological revolutionization of people, is a question of whether or not to engage in class struggle, a question of adhering to revolution or not, and a question of whether socialist society advances or regresses. Whether or not to give prominence to politics, whether or not to engage in the ideological revolutionization of people, is essentially a struggle between the two military building ideologies, the two military building lines, and the two military building policies of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and is a reflection of class struggle in the issue of army building. We must unswervingly give prominence to politics, give prominence to it this year, give prominence to it next year, give prominence to it every year, and give prominence to it forever.
    In order to continue giving prominence to politics and fundamentally strengthen combat readiness, Comrade Lin Biao put forward five principles. The Central Military Commission has decided to take these five principles as the guiding principles for the work of the entire army in 1966. Comrades of the entire army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and struggle to continue giving prominence to politics and resolutely implement the five principles.
    First, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and especially work hard on the word "apply", and regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all tasks of our army.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism. For our army, the best weapons are not airplanes, not artillery, not tanks, not atomic bombs, but Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and unafraid of death. Every one of our cadres and soldiers must take the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as their lifelong combat task and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.
    We must regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all tasks of the entire army. Reading Chairman Mao's books is not just reading in general. Reading in general can be implemented or not. Instructions must be implemented, and supreme instructions must especially be implemented. Chairman Mao's words are of the highest level, the highest prestige, and the greatest power, every sentence is the truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. All our army's work, all our speeches and actions, must be based on Mao Zedong Thought as the standard. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely support and resolutely do; whatever violates Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely resist and resolutely oppose.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "As for the theory of Marxism, we must be able to master it and apply it, and the purpose of mastering it lies entirely in applying it." "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and moreover it is more important learning." When we read Chairman Mao's books, we must especially work hard on the word "apply", and truly do "what Chairman Mao says, I will do." Learning must be related to reality, and must be used to transform thinking and improve work. If you learn but don't use it, no matter how much you learn, it won't work. We must adopt an honest attitude, study diligently, and use it seriously. We must not be lazy, we must not be complacent, learn a little, use a little, be consistent in word and deed, and do what we say. To learn well and use well, we must have a thorough spirit of self-revolution, use Chairman Mao's teachings to compare and examine our own thoughts and actions, dare to "put ourselves in", "reveal" our thoughts, and learn and use at the same time with problems in mind. For some fundamental viewpoints, we must learn and use them repeatedly. Cadres at all levels, especially cadres above the regimental level, must take the lead in studying well and using well, and set an example for the troops.
    This year, we must focus on studying Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, studying Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War", and deeply understand the spiritual essence and strategic and tactical principles of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. We must carry forward the revolutionary heroic spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, make ideological preparations for dealing with the enemy's early fighting, large-scale fighting, nuclear war, various wars, and fighting on several fronts, firmly establish the idea of serving all the Chinese people and all the people of the world, and carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.
    Second, adhere to the "Four Firsts", especially to grasping vigorously living ideas.
    Chairman Mao has always taught us: politics is the commander, is the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. The most important thing in political work is to adhere to the "Four Firsts", vigorously grasp living ideas, and use Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various realistic ideological and practical problems. Grasping living ideas means advocating the materialistic working method, going deep into reality, conducting investigation and research, promptly grasping the situation, and quickly grasping the budding of things and the budding of ideas, and taking different methods to deal with different problems in a timely manner. Not grasping living ideas is the easiest and most lazy way, but it is the least able to solve problems. Not grasping living ideas means being divorced from reality, only talking empty words, and not being relevant. Grasping living ideas means improving the proletarian consciousness of the soldiers, and also helping the soldiers solve some practical problems. Both aspects are indispensable. However, the most important thing is to solve ideological problems. When people's consciousness is improved and their spiritual outlook is changed, many problems can be correctly treated and solved by themselves. It is not possible to solve it purely from a material point of view. If this problem is solved, that problem will still come out. We must use the methods of political work to carry out management and education, first manage our thoughts well; we cannot take an irresponsible attitude towards solving the practical difficulties of soldiers. The higher the morale of the soldiers and the greater their enthusiasm, the more the leadership should care about them. We must care about their political progress, care about their material and cultural life, care about their safety and health, and care about their practical difficulties. Whether solving the ideological problems or the practical problems of soldiers, it must be reasonable. "Feeling" is the class feeling of the proletariat. We must carry forward class friendship, truly regard soldiers as class brothers and close comrades-in-arms, and help and educate them with full enthusiasm. "Reason" is revolutionary reason. We must adhere to the principle of persuasive education and handle things according to the party's policies.
    When grasping living ideas vigorously, we must emphasize positive education and adhere to giving prominence to praise.
    When grasping living ideas vigorously, we must implement the eight aspects of political education proposed by the Military Commission well. We must conscientiously carry out the socialist education movement, carry out regular education on current affairs and policies, and carry out education on revolutionary traditions, so that all commanders and fighters can recognize the domestic and international class struggle situation, and be both domestic revolutionaries and international revolutionaries.
    Political and ideological work should be done more lively, more meticulously, more mass-based, and more thoroughly. We must mobilize the masses to do ideological work, everyone must do ideological work, do the work to the heart of everyone, and do it to every matter, to achieve one mind in a class, one mind in a platoon, and one mind in a company, and work together to complete various tasks, not only to be able to pass the test in peacetime, but also to be able to pass the test in wartime.
    Third, leading cadres must go deep into the grassroots, vigorously grasp the "Four Good Companies" movement, conscientiously do a good job in the grassroots, and at the same time conscientiously do a good job in the leadership style of cadres.
    This year's focus of leadership work should still be placed on the grassroots. We must grasp implementation, lay the foundation, and seek quality, so that the "Four Good Companies" movement can be carried out more deeply and more solidly. To create "Four Good Companies", we must give prominence to politics and implement the five principles. For the old "Four Good Companies", we must help them consolidate and improve their existing achievements, and make them even better, but the leadership must not do everything for them, give them preferential conditions, let alone cover up their shortcomings and passively protect the "Four Good". For the companies that have not been rated as "Four Good", we must help them sum up their experiences and lessons, fully mobilize their positive factors, and encourage them to catch up with and surpass the advanced. The leadership must be good at using the point to lead the surface, grasp both ends to bring the middle, and do a good job in all companies. The work of the company must be based on the "Four Good" as the outline, and work should be arranged in a unified way according to the order of political ideology, the "Three-Eight Work Style", military training, and life management. These four aspects must be done well, but the primary thing is to do a good job in political and ideological work. We must repeatedly study and apply the twelve basic experiences of company building, and conscientiously implement the four regulations on company political work and the regulations on management and education work. We must conscientiously strengthen the construction of party branches, give full play to the role of party branches as fighting fortresses and the exemplary role of party members, and give play to the assistant role of the Communist Youth League branches and revolutionary committees.
    Chairman Mao said: "In all practical work of our party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." Leading cadres and organ cadres must go deep into reality and deep into the masses, and must go down to stay at the grassroots level. We must better implement face-to-face leadership, root ourselves in the companies and in the masses, and never float on the surface and do official articles. We must be diligent, willing to use our brains, and do it ourselves. We must not engage in laziness, be indifferent, or just talk empty words. We must be down-to-earth, pay attention to practical results, not randomly put forward slogans, create fancy things, or add tasks, and not engage in formalism or scholasticism. We must give more concrete help to the lower levels, clarify things one by one, solve problems one by one, and not just rely on giving orders, not add pressure indiscriminately, and not easily draw conclusions when grasping a point. We must use the viewpoint of dividing one into two and an honest attitude, say one if there is one, say two if there are two, not be arrogant and complacent if there are achievements, and not cover up shortcomings, and not jump up when shortcomings are mentioned. The greater the work achievement, the more we must see our own shortcomings and weak links. Never turn up our tails after making a little achievement. Don't turn up our tails after making a little, don't turn up our tails after making two points, and don't turn up our tails even more after making three or four points. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty makes people progress, and arrogance makes people lag behind", and always be modest and prudent, and never turn up our tails.
    Fourth, boldly promote truly outstanding commanders and fighters to key responsible positions.
    According to Chairman Mao's instructions on training and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, boldly promoting truly outstanding commanders and fighters to key responsible positions is a major strategic measure to ensure that our army will always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and always maintain the party's revolutionary traditions, and is also the most important organizational guarantee for continuing to give prominence to politics, implementing the "Four Good", and strengthening combat readiness. The criteria for us to select cadres should be loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly serving the vast majority of the people of China and the world, being able to unite the vast majority of people to work together, and having a democratic work style and a spirit of self-criticism. The selection of cadres must adhere to the class line, pay attention to both family origin and "focus on performance", and not be solely based on family origin. The leadership must go deep into the grassroots to discover talent and treat the work of identifying and selecting new forces as an important task to be carried out. Old cadres must help new cadres with their thinking, pass on their experience, and set an example of work style, and boldly let them work so that they can be tempered in actual struggle. New cadres must learn from old cadres with humility, closely contact the masses, work diligently and conscientiously, carry forward the style of hard work and plain living, and maintain the true color of an ordinary soldier.
    Fifth, painstakingly practice excellent techniques and tactics of close combat and night combat.
    We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to conduct military training and improve the tactical and technical level of the troops. Campaign and tactical training should take Chairman Mao's military works as basic teaching materials, and at the same time conscientiously study Comrade Lin Biao's relevant instructions, so that grassroots cadres can learn the skills of organizing and commanding operations. Technical and professional training should also use Chairman Mao's relevant expositions as a guiding ideology. In military training, we must strengthen political and ideological work, boldly mobilize the masses, carry out military democracy, break old frameworks, and abandon foreign dogma. We must adhere to the principle of being few but精 [jīng - refined, excellent], proceed from the needs of actual combat, conduct training strictly and difficultly, so that we can start it and hit it accurately under any circumstances. We must grasp the excellent skills within 200 meters and the tactical training of close combat and night combat, and we must train our thinking, train our work style, and train the troops to be able to walk, fight, master night combat skills, dare to fight alone, dare to see blood with bayonets, and be able to rush up and hold on.
    Continuing to give prominence to politics and resolutely implementing the five principles, the key lies in the strong leadership of the Party Committee. Party committees at all levels must use their main energy to truly grasp the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and truly go deep into reality to grasp living ideas. If these two points are grasped well, problems can be solved ideologically and organizationally, and work will be done more vividly, more meticulously, and more effectively. Party committees at all levels must adhere to using Mao Zedong Thought as the commander in all their work, and control the prominence of politics well. Those who resolutely implement giving prominence to politics should be praised and supported. Those with vague understanding should be educated and helped. Those who are superficially compliant but actually opposed to giving prominence to politics should be criticized and struggled against. We must never think that giving prominence to politics is enough, and that all problems have been solved, but in fact it is far from enough. Just like starting to climb Mount Everest, we are still far from the peak. "Infinite scenery is at the perilous peak", everyone must continue to work hard.
    All commanders and fighters of our army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, resolutely implement the five principles of giving prominence to politics, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, adhere to the "Four Firsts", greatly promote the "Three-Eight Work Style", carry forward the "Three Great Democracies", carry out the "Four Good Companies" movement, fully prepare for a war against aggression by U.S. imperialism, and put the foothold of all our work on the word "fight". As long as we strengthen political and ideological work, make the atmosphere of studying Mao Zedong Thought strong, raise proletarian consciousness high, boost morale high, make unity good, and make hatred for the enemy deep, we will be invincible in the world and be able to defeat any enemy. If U.S. imperialism insists on imposing a war of aggression on the Chinese people and dares to have another contest with us, then please do! The Chinese People's Liberation Army is determined to make its greatest contribution, together with the people of the whole country and the people of the world, to the thorough burial of U.S. imperialism, the culprit of war, in the just war against U.S. imperialist aggression! To fight to the end for the liberation of our territory Taiwan, for the defense of the motherland's security, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world! Victory will always belong to us!

    更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为继续突出政治、坚决执行五项原则而斗争
    ——《解放军报》元旦社论摘要
    一九六五年，全军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出政治，各方面工作获得了全面丰收，全面跃进。干部战士活学活用毛主席著作比往年成效更大，政治觉悟提得更高，革命干劲鼓得更足。雷锋、王杰式的好人好事大量涌现，四好连队运动有了新的发展。仗打得更漂亮，训练搞得更扎实，各项任务完成得更出色。我军在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上又大大地迈进了一步。
    林彪同志根据毛主席历来教导、我军历史经验和当前情况提出的突出政治的指示，具有伟大的战略意义。它是加强我军革命化、现代化建设的根本，是做好粉碎美帝国主义侵略战争的准备工作的根本，是反对和防止现代修正主义、保证我军永不变质的根本。突出政治不是一项任意的政策，而是根据社会主义社会发展规律和社会主义社会的经济基础所提出的根本措施。社会主义社会要随着生产的发展，不断地提高人民的物质生活和文化生活，但是，决不能象资本主义社会那样搞物质刺激。我们主要靠政治思想工作提高人的无产阶级觉悟，把精神的力量转化为物质的力量。搞不搞突出政治，搞不搞人的思想革命化，就是搞不搞阶级斗争的问题，就是坚持革命还是不坚持革命的问题，就是关系社会主义社会前进还是倒退的问题。搞不搞突出政治，搞不搞人的思想革命化，实质上是无产阶级和资产阶级两种建军思想、两条建军路线、两个建军方针的斗争，是阶级斗争在军队建设问题上的反映。我们要坚定不移地突出政治，今年突出，明年突出，年年突出，永远突出。
    为了继续突出政治，从根本上加强战备，林彪同志提出了五项原则。中央军委决定，把这五项原则作为一九六六年全军工作的方针。全军同志必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为继续突出政治、坚决执行五项原则而斗争。
    第一，活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫，要把毛主席的书当作我们全军各项工作的最高指示。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。我们每一个干部战士，都要把活学活用毛主席著作，当作自己毕生的战斗任务，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。
    一定要把毛主席的书当作全军各项工作的最高指示。读毛主席的书，不是一般地读书。一般地读书，可以执行，也可以不执行。指示就必须执行，最高指示就尤其要执行。毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。我军的一切工作，我们的一切言论行动，都必须以毛泽东思想为准则。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决拥护，坚决去做；凡是违背毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决抵制，坚决反对。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”我们读毛主席的书，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫，真正做到“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”。学就要联系实际，就要用来改造思想，改进工作。学了不用，学得再多，也不顶事。必须采取老实的态度，勤奋地学，认真地用，不能偷懒，不能自满，学一点，用一点，言行一致，说到做到。要学得好，用得好，就必须有彻底的自我革命精神，用毛主席的教导来对照检查自己的思想和行动，勇于把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，带着问题，边学边用。对一些根本观点，更要反复学，反复用。各级干部，特别是团以上干部，要带头学好，带头用好，给部队作出榜样。
    今年要着重学习毛主席的人民战争思想，学习林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》一文，深刻领会毛主席的人民战争思想的精神实质和战略战术原则。要发扬一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命英雄主义精神，做好对付敌人早打、大打、打核战争、打各种战争、在几条战线上打的思想准备，牢固地树立为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的思想，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    第二，坚持四个第一，特别要大抓狠抓活思想。
    毛主席历来教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。政治工作，最重要的，就是要坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想，用毛泽东思想回答和解决各种现实思想问题和实际问题。抓活思想，就是要提倡唯物论的工作方法，就是要深入实际，就是要调查研究，就是要及时摸清情况，就是要迅速地抓住事物的苗头、思想的苗头，针对不同的问题，及时采取不同的办法处理。不抓活思想，最省事，最能偷懒，但是，最不能解决问题。不抓活思想，就脱离实际，就只能说空话，不关痛痒。抓活思想，就要提高战士的无产阶级觉悟，同时，也要帮助战士解决一些实际问题。两方面缺一不可。但是，最主要的，是解决思想问题。人的觉悟提高了，精神面貌改变了，许多问题就可以正确对待，自行解决。单纯从物质上去解决不行，这个问题解决了，那个问题还会出来。必须用政治工作的方法进行管理教育，首先管好思想；对解决战士的实际困难，又不能采取不负责任的态度。战士的情绪越高，干劲越大，领导上越要关心他们。要关心他们政治上的进步，关心他们的物质文化生活，关心他们的安全和健康，关心他们的实际困难。无论解决战士的思想问题还是实际问题，都要合情合理。情，就是无产阶级的阶级感情。要发扬阶级友爱，把战士真正当作阶级兄弟和亲密战友，满腔热情地去帮助和教育他们。理，就是革命道理。要坚持说服教育的原则，按党的政策办事。
    大抓狠抓活思想，一定要强调正面教育，坚持表扬为主。
    大抓狠抓活思想，要把军委提出的政治教育的八个侧面，很好地落实。要认真搞好社会主义教育运动，搞好经常性的时事政策教育，搞好革命传统教育，使全体指战员认清国内外阶级斗争形势，既当国内革命派，又当国际革命派。
    政治思想工作要做得更活，更细，更有群众性，更过硬。要发动群众，人人做思想工作，把工作做到每个人的心坎上，做到每件事情上，达到一个班一条心，一个排一条心，一个连一条心，齐心协力地去完成各项任务，不仅平时过得硬，战时更能过得硬。
    第三，领导干部要深入基层，狠抓四好连队运动，切实搞好基层，同时要切实搞好干部的领导作风。
    今年领导工作的重点，仍然要放在基层。要抓落实，打基础，求质量，把四好连队运动搞得更深入、更扎实。创造四好连队，一定要突出政治，贯彻执行五项原则。对老四好连队，要帮助他们巩固和提高现有的成绩，做到好上加好，但是，领导上不能包办代替，给予优厚条件，更不能掩盖缺点，消极保四好。对没有评上四好的连队，要帮助他们总结经验教训，充分调动他们的积极因素，鼓励他们赶先进、超先进。领导上要善于以点带面，抓两头带中间，把所有连队都搞好。连队工作一定要以四好为纲，按照政治思想、三八作风、军事训练、生活管理的顺序统一安排工作。这四个方面都要搞好，但是，首要的是把政治思想工作搞好。要反复学习和运用连队建设的十二条基本经验，认真贯彻执行连队政治工作的四个条例和管理教育工作条例。要切实加强党支部的建设，充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用和党员的模范作用，发挥团支部、革委会的助手作用。
    毛主席说：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”领导干部和机关干部，一定要深入实际，深入群众，一定要下去蹲点。要更好地实行面对面的领导，把根子扎在连队，扎在群众当中，决不能浮在上面，做官样文章。一定要勤快，肯用脑子，亲自动手，不搞懒汉主义，不要无所用心，不要光说空话。一定要扎扎实实，讲求实效，不要乱提口号、乱搞花样、乱加任务，不要搞形式主义、搞烦琐哲学。一定要对下面多作具体帮助，一件事一件事搞清楚，一个问题一个问题解决，不能光靠发号施令，不能乱加压力，不能抓住一点就轻易作结论。一定要用一分为二的观点和老老实实的态度，有一说一，有二说二，有成绩不要骄傲自满，沾沾自喜，有缺点不要护短，不要一提缺点就跳起来。工作成绩越大，越是要看到自己的缺点和薄弱环节。决不要做出一点成绩就翘尾巴。做一点不要翘，做两点不要翘，做三点四点更不要翘。我们要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，永远谦虚谨慎，永远不翘尾巴。
    第四，大胆地提拔真正优秀的指战员到关键性的负责岗位上。
    根据毛主席关于培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示，大胆地把真正优秀的指战员提拔到关键性的负责岗位上，是保证我军永远忠实于毛泽东思想、永远保持党的革命传统的重大战略措施，也是继续突出政治、落实四好、加强战备最重要的组织保证。我们选拔干部的标准，应该是忠实于毛泽东思想，全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务，能够团结绝大多数人一道工作，有民主作风和自我批评精神。选拔干部要坚持阶级路线，既要重视出身成份，又要“重在表现”，不要唯成份论。领导上要深入基层，发现人材，把物色和选拔新生力量的工作当做一项重要任务去执行。老干部对新干部要帮思想，传经验，带作风，大胆放手地让他们工作，使他们在实际斗争中受到锻炼。新干部要虚心向老干部学习，密切联系群众，兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，保持普通一兵的本色。
    第五，苦练过硬的技术和近战夜战的战术。
    要以毛泽东思想为指针，进行军事训练，提高部队的战术技术水平。战役和战术训练，要以毛主席的军事著作为基本教材，同时认真学习林彪同志的有关指示，使基层干部学会组织指挥作战的本领。技术和专业训练也要用毛主席的有关论述作为指导思想。在军事训练中，一定要加强政治思想工作，放手发动群众，开展军事民主，打破旧框框，抛弃洋教条。要坚持少而精的方针，从实战需要出发，从严从难地进行训练，做到在任何情况下都能够开得动、打得准。要抓好二百米内的过硬功夫和近战夜战的战术训练，要练思想，练作风，练得部队能走、会打，掌握夜战本领，敢于孤胆作战，敢于刺刀见红，冲就冲得上，守就守得住。
    继续突出政治，坚决执行五项原则，关键在于党委的坚强领导。各级党委必须以主要精力，真正抓好活学活用毛主席著作，真正深入实际抓好活思想。抓好了这两条，就能从思想上组织上解决问题，工作就会做得更生动，更细致，更有成效。各级党委必须在一切工作中坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，把好突出政治的关。对突出政治坚决执行的，要表扬，要支持。对认识模糊的，要教育，要帮助。对个别阳奉阴违、反对突出政治的人，要批评，要斗争。我们千万不要以为突出政治已经够了，什么问题都解决了，其实还不够得很。象开始攀登珠穆朗玛峰一样，离顶峰还差得远。“无限风光在险峰”，大家还要继续努力。
    我军全体指战员一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行突出政治的五项原则，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动，充分做好反对美帝国主义侵略战争的准备，把我们全部工作的立脚点放在“打”字上。只要我们加强了政治思想工作，把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把无产阶级觉悟提得高高的，把士气鼓得足足的，把团结搞得好好的，把对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，我们就无敌于天下，就能够打败任何敌人。如果美帝国主义硬要把侵略战争强加于中国人民，胆敢和我们再来一次较量，那就请吧！中国人民解放军决心在反对美帝国主义侵略的正义战争中，同全国人民一道，同全世界人民一道，为彻底埋葬美帝国主义这个战争的罪魁祸首，做出自己最大的贡献！为解放我国领土台湾，为保卫祖国安全、保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗到底！胜利永远是属于我们的！
