    Going out of the office and down to the grassroots level is an important aspect of the county committee's revolutionization. However, "being physically present" at the grassroots level is not the same as "going deep" into the grassroots level. If one no longer floats around in the county, but floats around in the commune, production brigade, or a small circle of cadres, and does not go among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, then one is still not truly in touch with reality. "Being physically present" without "going deep" is not a matter of method, but a matter of ideology.

    “身入”与“深入”
    走出办公室到基层去，是县委革命化的一个重要方面。但“身入”基层，还不等于“深入”基层。不浮在县里了，却浮在公社、大队或干部的小圈子里，不到广大贫农下中农和社员当中去，还是没有真正接触实际。“身入”而不“深入”，不是一个方法问题，而是一个思想问题。
