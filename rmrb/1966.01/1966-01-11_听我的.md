    “Listen to Me”
    Years of practice have made me deeply aware that as a leading cadre, to do a good job, one must absolutely not harbor the idea of lording over the masses, and one cannot demand that the masses "listen to me" in everything. To do so would not only prevent the true victory of the cause of the liberation of the masses, but one would inevitably suffer setbacks in the face of the masses.
    Henan, Ye County  Hou Yinting
    "Listen to me" is, in formal terms, commandism. Commandists lack a fundamental Marxist viewpoint, that is, they do not understand that all revolutionary work can only be done by relying on the masses; at the same time, they misunderstand a fundamental issue, not regarding themselves as a part of the masses, but rather as standing high above them.
      "You order me, I go through the motions." This is a common way for the masses to deal with commandists. Commandists often turn revolutionary work into something merely formal, which looks imposing but is actually extremely harmful.

### “听我的”

    “听我的”
    多年的实践，使我深感作为一个领导干部，要做好工作，绝对不能抱着驾凌群众之上的思想，不能要求群众处处“听我的”。那样做，非但不能使群众的解放事业真正胜利，自己也必然在群众面前碰得头破血流。
    河南叶县  侯印亭
    “听我的”，正规的名词就是命令主义。命令主义者缺乏马克思主义的一个根本观点，就是不理解一切革命工作只能依靠群众去做；同时他们弄错了一个根本性的问题，不把自己看成是群众中的一分子，而是高居于群众之上。
      “你命令我，我敷衍你。”这是群众对付命令主义者的常用办法。命令主义者往往把革命工作变成了徒具形式的东西，看起来好象威风凛凛，实际上危害极大。
