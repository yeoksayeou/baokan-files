　　Make the Invaders Unable to Move an Inch
　　——Old Militia of Qingyuan County, Hebei Province Discuss the Film "Tunnel Warfare"

　　The militia traditional education film "Tunnel Warfare" has recently been completed by the August First Film Studio. Most of the film's exterior scenes were shot in the Ranjhuang area of Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, which is nationally known for its tunnel warfare. In mid-January, the August First Film Studio sent the film "Tunnel Warfare" to Qingyuan and invited old militiamen and old guerrillas from Ranjhuang, Nandaran Village, Zhongran Village, Linshui Village, Xiaofu Village, and other places to watch the film. These old militiamen who personally participated in the tunnel warfare and valiantly resisted the Japanese invading bandits and the Kuomintang reactionaries warmly welcomed this film that truthfully reflects the tunnel warfare in central Hebei. At the discussion meeting, they recalled the arduous journey of struggle in those years, praised the great victory of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, and resolved to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, carry forward the glorious tradition of people's war, and be ready at any time to thoroughly annihilate any enemy who dares to invade.

　　The Revolutionary People's Strength is Greatest

　　The film evoked memories of this glorious history of struggle among the old militiamen. They said at the discussion meeting: This film is well-made and true to life. The events in the film are what happened here. Don't think that the Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang relied on their large numbers and good weapons and looked very scary, but they never gained any advantage here. In the end, the revolutionary people's strength is the greatest, and there are the most methods.

　　Yuan Xiang, political commissar of the People's Armed Forces Department of Qingyuan County, is a national militia combat hero famous for his persistence in tunnel warfare. This former militia company commander and armed work team leader said: "In 1945, we dug tunnels in the wild connecting villages. The masses in more than 20 villages worked together and dug dozens of tunnels connecting village to village in three days and three nights. At that time, every village had tunnels, and landmines were buried everywhere. Although there were only one or two dozen militiamen in a village, and the weapons were all red-tasseled spears, earthen guns, and earthen landmines, hundreds and thousands of enemies came to 'mop up' many times, but they could not pull out this sharp knife inserted in their hearts."

　　Yuan Xiang also said: "At that time, it was not only the Eighth Route Army, guerrillas, and militiamen who were fighting. The common people were helping us fight. The Japanese devils tried to ambush our militia company several times, but because the villagers tipped us off, we were able to transfer safely every time."

　　Li Minggui, an old militiaman from Ranjhuang, once killed a puppet army deputy regimental commander by using concealed tunnel fortifications in a battle. He said: "When we were fighting the Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek, we resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call. Men and women, old and young, all rose up to struggle together. Everyone persisted in guerrilla warfare and carried out tunnel warfare, and in the end, we defeated Japanese imperialism and the reactionaries. With Chairman Mao's leadership and the strength of the masses, we are not afraid of any enemy who comes."

　　The More We Fight, the More Methods We Have

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, blockhouses were densely packed within Qingyuan County, and highways were intertwined. Many villages were looted many times by the Japanese invading bandits and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　In such a harsh situation, could guerrilla warfare still be persisted in? What should the people do? The old militiamen of Ranjhuang answered these questions:

　　Gao Zhenfeng said: "In those years, the environment was really difficult. There was nowhere to hide, and nowhere to run. At that time, the leading comrades in the county told us that if we don't eliminate the enemy, the enemy will eliminate us. Only by persisting in the struggle can we survive and achieve victory. We listened to the Party's words and persevered in the struggle. This path was the right one."

　　Wang Zhenlu said: "At first, when the enemy came, we hid. Some people dug a hole and hid, but they couldn't hide. It won't work if you only hide and don't fight. You can only hide if you fight."

　　In the face of the enemy, the people of Ranjhuang did not compromise or surrender. Like the people of other villages in Qingyuan, under the leadership of the Party, they persisted in the struggle and learned war in the war. Finally, they found a victorious path from the practice of struggle—carrying out tunnel warfare.

　　The old militiamen summarized their experience and said: "No matter how fierce the enemy is, no matter how harsh the environment is, don't be afraid. Grit your teeth and persevere, pick up your guns and fight the enemy, and find ways to fight the enemy. If you are weak, the enemy will be strong; if you are strong, the enemy will be weak. The more we fight, the more methods we have and the stronger our strength; the more the enemy fights, the more scattered they become. As long as we dare to struggle and dare to win, victory will definitely be ours."

　　Fighting the Enemy with Fear and Trembling

　　Zhang Choudan, an old militiaman from Xiaofu Village, said: "During the tunnel warfare, it was just like what was shown in the film. Our weapons were indeed not strong. Pistols could only load one bullet at a time; rifles required a hard kick to open the bolt; homemade grenades would only break into two large pieces when they exploded; landmines and explosives were also made by ourselves. But whether these not-so-good weapons work depends on who holds them. When we held them, we still made the heads of the Japanese devils and traitors bloom. Our thinking is firm, and we listen to the Party's words, and even the worst guys are easy to use in our hands."

　　Liang Lianheng of Ranjhuang said: "Our guns are not good, but our people are good. If the people are good, it works, and we can win battles."

　　Comrade Yuan Xiang also said: "We rely on courage to fight, not without strategy and tactics. Tunnel warfare is the most particular about strategy and tactics."

　　The old militiamen all like to watch the battle scenes in the film where tunnel warfare annihilated the enemy. They said: We fight like that in the movie, underground, on the ground, and on the houses all at the same time. We are in the tunnels and darkrooms, and the enemy can't see us or touch us. The enemy is in the open, and we are in the dark. We can fight whenever we want, and we can leave whenever we want. When we want to hit the enemy, we hit them every time; when the enemy wants to hit us, they can't find the target. Our earthen guns can be used for concealed combat and mutual cover in the favorable terrain of tunnels and fortifications, and can also buy time and exert firepower.

　　Tunnel warfare, which gives full play to the superiority of people's war, made the enemy tremble with fear. At that time, the Japanese puppet army suffered several losses in Ranjhuang, and they were so scared that they said: "Rather go around Heifengkou than walk from Ranjhuang."

　　Let the Younger Generation Learn to Struggle

　　These old militiamen who have the motherland in their hearts and the world in their sights, after watching the movie, recalled the past and thought of the present.

　　Li Minggui of Ranjhuang said: "We saw the Japanese devils who killed and set fires in our China in the movie, but we must not forget the American devils who are killing and setting fires in Vietnam today. These dog bandits never let the people of the world live a good life. We must support the Vietnamese brothers well. If the American devils dare to come to our China, we will resolutely not let them go back to harm people again."

　　Feng Hanzhong of Xiaofu Village said: "We have already competed with the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries. They have all tasted the taste of our tunnel warfare and are all defeated by us. If American imperialism dares to come today, we will let them taste that taste too!"

　　Zhang Choudan said: "If the enemy dares to come, I guarantee to take the lead and fight them again. Not only will we fight, but we must also bring the youth to fight together. Right now, we must help the youth learn well, let them study Chairman Mao's books thoroughly, remember the deep hatred for imperialism and the reactionaries, and learn our combat experience and skills."

　　Sun Licheng, an old militiaman from Linshui Village, is already sixty years old. He said spiritedly: "In the past, I asked the devils, traitors, and reactionaries to eat a big dustpan of grenades, and eliminated a lot of them. Although I am a bit older now, I can still do a big job again. A few days ago, I also took the young men to practice in the wild. We have to quickly teach them all our skills."

　　In the past, we used people's war to defeat Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; today, we still have to use people's war to defeat American imperialism. Just as Wang Yu of Linshui Village said: "If American imperialism dares to come, we will make it like Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, unable to move an inch, and there will be no return."

### 管叫侵略者寸步难行——河北省清苑县老民兵座谈影片《地道战》

    管叫侵略者寸步难行
    ——河北省清苑县老民兵座谈影片《地道战》
    民兵传统教育片《地道战》，最近已由八一电影制片厂摄制完成。这部影片的大部分外景是在以开展地道战而闻名全国的河北省清苑县冉庄地区拍摄的。一月中旬，八一电影制片厂把《地道战》影片送到清苑，邀请冉庄、南大冉村、中冉村、林水村、小福村等地的老民兵、老游击队员观看了影片。这些亲身参加地道斗争、英勇抗击日本侵略强盗和国民党反动派的老民兵们，热烈欢迎这部真实地反映了冀中地道斗争的影片。在座谈会上，他们回忆当年斗争的艰苦历程，畅叙毛主席人民战争思想的伟大胜利，决心依照毛主席的指示，发扬人民战争的光荣传统，随时准备彻底歼灭敢于来犯的任何敌人。
    革命人民力量最大
    影片引起了老民兵们对这段光荣斗争历史的回忆。他们在座谈会上说：这部影片拍得好、拍得真。电影里演的事情，就是咱们这里的事。别看日本鬼子和蒋介石匪帮仗着人多、武器好，样子挺吓人，可从来没在咱们这里占到过什么便宜。说到头，还是咱们革命人民的力量最大，办法最多。
    清苑县人民武装部政治委员苑祥，是以坚持地道战而著名的全国民兵战斗英雄。这位当年的民兵连长、武工队长说：“一九四五年我们挖野外连村地道，二十多个村庄的群众一齐动手，三天三夜就把村村相连的几十条地道挖通了。那时，村村有地道，到处埋地雷，虽然一个村子里只有一、二十个民兵，武器也尽是些红缨枪、土枪、土地雷，但是成百成千的敌人多次来扫荡，也拔不掉这把插在他们心窝里的尖刀。”
    苑祥还说：“当时，打仗的不光是八路军、游击队和民兵，老百姓都在帮我们打仗。日本鬼子曾经几次想打我们民兵连的伏击，可是由于乡亲们通风报信，每次我们都安全转移了。”
    冉庄老民兵李明贵，曾经在一次战斗中，利用隐蔽的地道工事，打死一个伪军副团长。他说：“打日本鬼子和蒋介石那阵，咱们坚决响应毛主席的号召，男男女女、老老少少一齐起来斗争，大伙儿坚持游击战，开展地道战，到头硬是把日本帝国主义和反动派打败了。有毛主席的领导，有群众的力量，什么敌人来了都不怕。”
      越斗办法越多
    在抗日战争和解放战争中，清苑县境内炮楼林立，公路交织，许多村庄多次遭到日本侵略强盗和国民党反动派的洗劫。
    在这样严酷的形势下，游击战还能不能坚持？人民该怎么办？冉庄的老民兵们回答了这些问题：
    高振峰说：“那年头，环境实在艰苦，躲没躲处，跑没跑处。当时县里的领导同志给我们讲，咱们不消灭敌人，敌人就要消灭咱们，只有坚持斗争，咱们才能活得下去，才能得到胜利。我们听了党的话，硬是把斗争坚持下来了，这条路是走对了。”
    王振禄说：“起初，敌人来了，咱们就躲，有人挖个地洞藏起来，可是那里躲得过去。光藏不打不行。打了才能藏得住。”
    在敌人面前，冉庄人民没有妥协，没有投降。他们跟清苑各村人民一样，在党的领导下，坚持斗争，在战争中学习战争，终于从斗争的实践中找到了一条胜利的道路——开展地道战。
    老民兵总结他们的经验说：“敌人再凶，环境再艰苦，你也不要怕，要咬着牙坚持，要拿起枪杆跟敌人拼，要想办法跟敌人斗。你软敌人就硬，你硬敌人就软。斗来斗去，咱们越斗办法越多，力量越强；敌人越斗越稀松。只要敢于斗争，敢于胜利，胜利就一定是咱们的。”
    打得敌人心惊胆颤
    小福村的老民兵张臭旦说：“打地道战那阵，跟电影里演的一样，咱们的武器也确实不强。手枪，是一回只能上一粒子弹的‘撅把子’；步枪，是使劲踢才能拉开栓的‘脚蹬式’；土造的手榴弹炸开了，只能崩成两大块；地雷、炸药也是自己造的。可是这些不怎么样的武器管不管用，要看拿在谁手里。咱们拿着它，照样让鬼子、汉奸的脑袋开花。咱们思想坚定，听党的话，再差的家伙在咱们手里也好使。”
    冉庄的梁连恒说：“咱们枪不好，可是人好。人好就管用，就能打胜仗。”
    苑祥同志又说：“我们打仗靠勇敢精神，并不是不讲战略战术，地道战是最讲究战略战术的。”
    老民兵们都最喜欢看影片里的地道战歼灭敌人的战斗场景。他们说：咱们就是象电影里那个打法，地下、地面、房上一齐打。咱们在地道里、暗室里，敌人看不见，摸不着。敌人在明处，咱们在暗处。咱们想打就打，想走就走。咱要打敌人，一打一个着；敌人要打咱，就是找不到目标。咱们的土枪在地道和工事的有利地形里，可以隐蔽作战，相互掩护，也能争取时间，发扬火力。
    充分发挥人民战争优越性的地道战，打得敌人心惊胆颤。当时日伪军一连几次在冉庄吃了大亏，他们吓得说：“宁绕黑风口，不从冉庄走。”
  让年青一代学会斗争
    这些胸怀祖国，放眼世界的老民兵们，看了电影以后，既回忆了过去，又想到了现在。
    冉庄的李明贵说：“咱们在电影里看到了过去在咱们中国杀人放火的日本鬼子，可也别忘了今天在越南杀人放火的美国鬼子。这些狗强盗总是不让世界上的老百姓过好日子。咱们一定要好好支援越南兄弟。美国鬼子要是敢来咱们中国，那就坚决不放它回去再糟害人了。”
    小福村的冯汉中说：“咱们已经跟日本鬼子和国民党反动派较量过了，它们都尝过咱们地道战的滋味，全是咱们的手下败将。今天美帝国主义要是敢来，咱们让他们也尝尝那滋味！”
    张臭旦说：“敌人要是敢来，我保证带头，再跟它打一场。不光咱们打，还得带着青年人一块打。眼下，咱们要好好地帮助青年学，让他们把毛主席的书扎扎实实地学好，把对帝国主义和反动派的深仇大恨记牢，把咱们的战斗经验和技术都学到手。”
    林水村的老民兵孙立成已经六十岁了。他精神抖擞地说：“我过去请鬼子、汉奸、反动派吃过一大簸箩手榴弹，干掉它们不少。眼下我年岁虽说大了些，可还能再大干一场。前些日子，我还带着小伙子们一块在野外操练，咱们得赶紧把本事全数教会他们。”
    过去，我们用人民战争打败了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派；今天，我们还是要用人民战争来打败美帝国主义。正象林水村王余所讲的那样：“美帝国主义它敢来，管叫它同日本帝国主义和国民党反动派一样，寸步难行，有来无回。”
