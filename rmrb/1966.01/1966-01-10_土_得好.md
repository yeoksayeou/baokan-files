    “Rustic” is Good
    Xie Yi
    In recent years, many young amateur worker-peasant-soldier writers have written many short and pithy good works. They have sung the praises of the socialist spring and shaped some brilliant heroic images, making socialist literature and art even more magnificent and vibrant.
    However, on the road of literary creation, some people have a relatively smooth journey, while others take a tortuous path. A young comrade in Hubei Province, who originally wrote folk songs, later thought this was "rustic stuff," not elegant, and of little value. In a moment of confusion, he went astray, and the works he wrote were quite unpresentable. The newly grown sapling was just budding when it showed signs of withering. Later, after being rescued, he became vigorous, blossomed, and bore fruit again.
    What's wrong with works like mountain songs and clapper rhymes being published in remote villages, sung by thousands and tens of thousands of people, resounding across the hills and fields, and creating a lively scene? "Demobilized but not detached from the gun, guarding the inner post after the outer post." "Red flags fluttering on the peaks and ridges, blasting away the stone slabs to pave the road." These verses, like war drums and bugles, aroused people's revolutionary enthusiasm and inspired their high-spirited fighting will. Compared to the bourgeois nonsense of sighing at the wind and moon, their value is infinitely higher. Such "rustic stuff" is indeed "rustic" for good!
    Precisely because "rustic stuff" comes from the masses of the people, it cannot be written by those who are divorced from the masses. Also, precisely because "rustic stuff" grows from the soil, it is naturally inevitable that it is somewhat rough at the beginning, but this phenomenon can be changed. In the South, there are banyan trees that cover the sky and the sun. They are very small at the beginning, but they can deeply root their aerial roots in the soil, absorb inexhaustible nutrients, and continuously develop and grow taller. As long as our young amateur writers strengthen self-transformation, forever labor and write for the revolution, and dare to root their roots in the soil for thirty or fifty years, then works worthy of our great era will surely emerge.

    “土”得好
    谢逸
    近年来，许多年青的工农兵业余作者，写出了不少短小精悍的好作品，他们歌颂了社会主义的春天，塑造出一些光辉的英雄形象，使社会主义文艺，更加绚烂鲜艳。
    但在文艺创作的道路上，有的人比较一帆风顺，有的人却走着曲折的道路。湖北有个青年同志，原来是写民歌的，后来认为这是“土货”，不文雅，价值不高。一时糊涂，就走入歧途，写出来的作品很不成样子。新长的幼树刚刚含苞，就呈现枯萎之状，后来经过挽救，他才又生气勃勃、开花结果了。
    山歌快板之类的作品，发表在僻乡远寨之间，千人歌万人唱，响遍了山岗田头，闹出了热气腾腾的景象，有什么不好呢？“复员离队不离枪，站完外岗站内岗。”“峰岩岭上红旗飘，炸掉石板铺大道。”这些诗句，象战鼓、象号角，激起了人们的革命热情，鼓舞着人们的昂扬斗志。这比起资产阶级那吟风弄月的货色来，价值不知高多少。这样的“土货”，实在“土”得好！
    正因为“土货”是来自人民群众之中，就不是那些脱离人民群众的人所能写得出来的。也正因为“土货”是从土里生长，一开始自然免不了有些粗糙，但这种现象是可以改变的。南方有榕树，遮天盖日，开始时也是很小的，但它能将须根深深地扎入土里，吸收了取之不尽的养料，就不断地发展高大起来。我们年青的业余作者，只要加强自我改造，永远为革命而劳动而写作，敢于将自己的根子在泥土里扎它三十年、五十年，那么，无愧于我们伟大时代的作品一定可以产生出来。
