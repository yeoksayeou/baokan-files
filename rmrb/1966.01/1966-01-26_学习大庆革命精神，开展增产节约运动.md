    With the start of the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, a new movement to increase production and practice economy is rising in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises across the country.

    This new movement to increase production and practice economy is rising amidst the upsurge of the broad masses of workers and staff on the industrial and transportation front to learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, surpass Daqing, and create more Daqing-style enterprises. Studying the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and applying Daqing's experience to the actual situation of the current increase production and practice economy movement will surely enable this year's increase production and practice economy movement to reach a new and higher level, and will surely create more Daqing-style enterprises on China's industrial and transportation front.

    The increase production and practice economy movement is a mass movement to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff in building socialism. What should we rely on to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses? We must rely on highlighting politics, highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, and arming the minds of the broad masses of workers and staff with Mao Zedong Thought. This is precisely the most fundamental aspect of Daqing's experience. What did Daqing Oilfield rely on for its construction? It relied on putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, starting from "Two Theories" (On Practice and On Contradiction), and advancing with the "Two-Point Method". To study the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and apply Daqing's experience to the increase production and practice economy movement, the most important aspect is to learn from Daqing's experience in highlighting Mao Zedong Thought and highlighting politics. Once Mao Zedong Thought becomes the guide for the actions of the broad masses of workers and staff, they will be full of courage and energy, able to find potentials that were not found in the past, and able to do things that could not be done in the past. The increase production and practice economy movement will then develop vigorously.

    The increase production and practice economy movement is a mass movement that requires combining soaring revolutionary drive with a rigorous scientific attitude. Without a soaring revolutionary drive, content with the status quo, there can be no talk of increasing production and practicing economy; without a rigorous scientific attitude, engaging in reckless actions, it will be difficult for increasing production and practicing economy to achieve practical results. Why was Daqing able to build itself into a world-class oilfield in a very short period of time? One of the important reasons is that they truly combined a soaring revolutionary drive with a rigorous scientific attitude, attached great importance to scientific experiments, attached great importance to investigation and research, and attached great importance to first-hand information. To study the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and apply Daqing's experience to the increase production and practice economy movement, we must combine a soaring revolutionary drive with a rigorous scientific attitude, just like Daqing did, lead the masses in a down-to-earth manner, proceed from reality, follow the principle of "everything through experimentation," and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. By combining a soaring revolutionary drive with a rigorous scientific attitude, and guiding the increase production and practice economy movement towards practical technical innovation and technical revolution, the increase production and practice economy movement will surely achieve practical results.

    The increase production and practice economy movement is a mass movement to develop socialist productive forces more, faster, better, and more economically. More, faster, better, and more economically are the opposites of a contradiction; better is the principal aspect of the contradiction. Putting "better" first, seeking more within "better," seeking faster within "better," and seeking economy within "better" is the unity of contradictions. Why can Daqing become a model for the comprehensive development of production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way? Because they put "better" first, adhered to high standards in everything, and made strict demands everywhere. When they excelled in "better," they achieved a comprehensive more, faster, better, and more economical. To study the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and apply Daqing's experience to the increase production and practice economy movement, we must put "better" first, just like Daqing did, and adhere to the policy of quality first. If we truly put "better" first, seek more within "better," seek faster within "better," and seek economy within "better," the increase production and practice economy movement will surely promote the comprehensive development of production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    Once the increase production and practice economy movement is launched, leaders at all levels must earnestly strengthen their leadership over the movement, pay close attention to the movement's trends, promptly discover and solve problems, act as sober promoters, and guide the increase production and practice economy movement to develop in the right direction. What especially needs attention is that after the masses are mobilized, we must pay close attention to cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses and resolutely implement the policy of combining work and rest; we must strengthen the maintenance and management of equipment and resolutely avoid using machinery and equipment beyond their capacity; we must strengthen labor protection work and resolutely implement the policy of safe production. Daqing is also a worthy example in these aspects. Daqing has a revolutionary leadership team armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They have a high degree of revolutionary drive, fearing neither heaven nor earth, and no difficulty can stump them; they have a rigorous scientific attitude, paying attention to investigation and research, grasping first-hand information, being realistic and meticulous. The reason why the broad masses of workers and staff in Daqing have been able to maintain their vigorous revolutionary drive and all equipment has been able to maintain its good condition is precisely because Daqing's leadership is a sober promoter.

    Increasing production and practicing economy is the fundamental way for us to build socialism, and running all our enterprises like Daqing is also the fundamental way to increase production and practice economy. Learning from Daqing, catching up with Daqing, and surpassing Daqing, and creating more Daqing-style enterprises, from the production perspective, is to better achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy.

    Daqing is a treasure trove. Daqing's experience fully embodies Mao Zedong Thought. Promoting Daqing's experience will enable the increase production and practice economy movement to be carried out at a higher level. Learning the spirit of Daqing, following the path of Daqing, and running Daqing-style enterprises is the foundation of enterprise construction and requires our long-term unremitting efforts. Learning the spirit of Daqing, following the path of Daqing, and running Daqing-style enterprises also needs to be combined with the current production struggle and be grounded in the increase production and practice economy movement. Let us carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Daqing, follow the revolutionary path of Daqing, carry out the increase production and practice economy movement vigorously and realistically, so that more Daqing-style enterprises appear in our country, and that our country's Third Five-Year Plan achieves a great victory in its first year.

### 学习大庆革命精神，开展增产节约运动

    学习大庆革命精神，开展增产节约运动
    在第三个五年计划第一年开始的时候，一个新的增产节约运动正在全国工矿交通企业兴起。
    这个新的增产节约运动，是在我国工业交通战线上的广大职工学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，创造更多的大庆式企业的热潮中兴起的。学习大庆的革命精神，把大庆经验运用到当前增产节约运动的实际中去，一定能使今年的增产节约运动达到一个新的更高的水平，也一定会在我国工业交通战线上创造更多的大庆式企业。
    增产节约运动，是一个调动广大职工建设社会主义积极性的群众运动。群众的积极性靠什么来调动？靠突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大职工的头脑。这正是大庆经验最根本的一条。大庆油田的建设靠的是什么？靠的是毛泽东思想挂帅，靠的是“两论”起家（《实践论》《矛盾论》），靠的是“两分法”前进。学习大庆的革命精神，把大庆的经验运用到增产节约运动中去，最重要的一条，也就是学习大庆突出毛泽东思想，突出政治的经验。毛泽东思想一旦成为广大职工的行动指针，他们就会浑身是胆，浑身是劲，就能找到过去没有找到的潜力，做出过去做不到的事情，增产节约运动就能蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    增产节约运动，是一个需要把冲天的革命干劲和严格的科学态度结合起来的群众运动。没有冲天的革命干劲，得过且过，就谈不到增产节约；没有严格的科学态度，蛮干一阵，增产节约也难收实效。大庆为什么能够在很短的时间内建设成世界上第一流的大油田？重要原因之一，就在于他们真正把冲天的革命干劲和严格的科学态度结合起来，十分重视科学实验，十分重视调查研究，十分重视第一性资料。学习大庆的革命精神，把大庆的经验运用到增产节约运动中去，就要象大庆那样把冲天的革命干劲和严格的科学态度结合起来，踏踏实实地领导群众，从实际出发，遵循“一切经过试验”的原则，开展技术革新和技术革命。把冲天的革命干劲和严格的科学态度结合起来，把增产节约运动引导到切切实实的技术革新和技术革命中去，增产节约运动就一定能收到实效。
    增产节约运动，是一个多快好省地发展社会生产力的群众运动。多、快、好、省，是矛盾的对立；好，是矛盾的主要方面。好字当头，好中求多，好中求快，好中求省，是矛盾的统一。大庆为什么能够成为多快好省地全面发展生产的典型呢？因为他们好字当头，事事高标准，处处严格要求，在好字上过硬了，才有了全面的多快好省。学习大庆的革命精神，把大庆的经验运用到增产节约运动中去，就是要象大庆那样好字当头，坚持质量第一的方针。真正把好字摆在头里，好中求多，好中求快，好中求省，增产节约运动就一定能推动生产多快好省地全面发展。
    增产节约运动一经开展，各级领导就要切实加强对运动的领导，密切注意运动的动向，及时发现问题、解决问题，做冷静的促进派，引导增产节约运动沿着正确的方向发展。特别需要注意的是：当群众发动起来以后，要十分注意爱护群众的积极性，坚决执行劳逸结合的方针；要加强设备的维修和管理，坚决不能超负荷地使用机器设备；要加强劳动保护工作，坚决执行安全生产的方针。大庆在这些方面同样是值得学习的典范。大庆有一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化的领导班子。他们有高度的革命干劲，天不怕，地不怕，没有难得倒他们的困难；他们有严谨的科学态度，注重调查研究，掌握第一性资料，实事求是，一丝不苟。大庆在建设的过程中，广大职工所以能够始终保持旺盛的革命干劲，一切设备所以能够保持良好的状态，正是因为大庆的领导是冷静的促进派。
    增产节约是我们建设社会主义的根本之道，把我们所有的企业办得象大庆那样又是增产节约的根本之道。学大庆，赶大庆，超大庆，创造更多的大庆式企业，从生产方面来看，就是为了更好地达到增产节约的目的。
    大庆是一个宝库。大庆的经验，充分体现了毛泽东思想。推广大庆经验将使增产节约运动在一个更高的水平上开展起来。学大庆精神，走大庆道路，办大庆式的企业，是企业建设的根本，是需要我们作长期不懈的努力的。学大庆精神，走大庆道路，办大庆式的企业，又需要同当前的生产斗争结合起来，落脚在增产节约运动中。让我们发扬大庆的革命精神，沿着大庆的革命道路，把增产节约运动轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地开展起来，使我们国家出现更多的大庆式企业，使我国的第三个五年计划在第一年就取得伟大的胜利。
