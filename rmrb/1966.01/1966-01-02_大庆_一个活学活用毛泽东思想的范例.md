    Daqing – An Example of the Living Study and Application of Mao Zedong Thought
    Every victory in the construction of the Daqing Oilfield is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for taking class struggle as the key link and conducting extensive and in-depth class education, and a victory for dialectical materialism over metaphysics.
    Under the leadership of the Party and the care and support of all relevant parties, the workers of the Daqing Oilfield overcame numerous difficulties from 1960 to 1963 and quickly took down this large oilfield. In 1964 and 1965, the oilfield's production and construction achieved new and significant accomplishments. Now, the Daqing Oilfield has been built into China's modern petroleum base. The quality of the oilfield's construction is excellent, the technology is advanced, and the economic benefits are very good. The construction of the Daqing Oilfield fully embodies the requirements of the general line for socialist construction: more, faster, better, and more economical. Now, due to the development of the Daqing Oilfield and the completion of some new refineries, China's economic construction, national defense construction, and the petroleum needed for people's lives can be basically self-sufficient, both in terms of quantity and variety. It marks the entry of China's petroleum industry construction into a new stage of development.
    Starting with "Two Essays"
    The Daqing Oilfield is a product of the Party's general line, a product of Mao Zedong Thought. The soul of the construction of the Daqing Oilfield is the Party's general line, Mao Zedong Thought.
    The construction of the Daqing Oilfield is an example of the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. At the beginning of the oilfield construction, there were many difficulties and many contradictions. What to do? The first decision issued by the oilfield Party committee was to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" extensively. Every oilfield builder had a copy: cadres read it, engineers read it, and workers read it. They used Mao Zedong Thought, the viewpoint of class struggle, and the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to analyze, study, and solve a series of problems in oilfield construction. The comrades of the oilfield said it well: Our oilfield started with "Two Essays" ("On Practice" and "On Contradiction").
    What were the contradictions and difficulties at that time? How did the comrades of the Daqing Oilfield use Mao Zedong Thought and "Two Essays" to solve these contradictions and difficulties?
    American imperialism economically blockaded us, and modern revisionists wanted to strangle us on the oil issue. We ourselves lacked experience. What to do? The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield understood from Chairman Mao's teachings that this was a life-and-death class struggle on an international scale. Imperialists and revisionists want to strangle us and kill us on the oil issue. We must shatter their conspiracies and intrigues. We must work harder, rely on our own efforts, and achieve self-sufficiency in oil. Their slogan was: "The well site is the battlefield against imperialism and revisionism." Their ambition was: "To use our own hands to remove the label of backwardness in the petroleum industry," "To make those who want to strangle us on the oil issue suffer a shameful defeat."
    Some foreign experts created a "theory" called "China's Poverty in Oil." These people said: "The rock types and formation ages in most parts of China do not have the possibility of storing oil with exploitable value." What to do? Should we be superstitious about this "foreign framework" and do nothing, or should we break free from the shackles of this "foreign framework"? The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield understood from Chairman Mao's teachings that true theory can only be "theory drawn from objective reality and proved in objective reality," that "human knowledge cannot be separated from practice at all," and resolutely opposed the subjective and metaphysical viewpoint of only relying on dead books and being superstitious about "foreign frameworks." In this way, they dared to make revolution and were brave in practice. Guided by our own theory, our geological workers, starting from China's actual conditions, selected a region and concentrated superior forces to conduct exploration. The result proved that under China's geological conditions, not only could oilfields be found, but also large oilfields could be found. The so-called "China's Poverty in Oil" theory went bankrupt.
    Tens of thousands of people suddenly poured into a large grassland, "with the blue sky above and a vast grassland below." Life was very difficult. It was freezing cold, there were no houses, no beds, and even pots, stoves, and utensils were not enough. The production conditions were also very difficult. Under these circumstances, should we face the difficulties or retreat? The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield, following Chairman Mao's teachings in "On Contradiction," repeatedly studied various difficulties and contradictions, and believed that from the perspective of the overall interests and long-term interests of the country, facing the difficulties was nothing more than sweating more and suffering more, which were local and secondary difficulties; if we retreated in the face of difficulties, the country would have no oil, which was a fundamental and primary difficulty. They understood that "in times of difficulty, we must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage," understood that "conditions can be prepared while doing it," understood that doing revolution requires the revolutionary heroic spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and must be able to endure great hardships and heavy labor. This was a question of whether or not to treat the hardships and difficulties in the revolution with a proletarian revolutionary spirit. In this way, with a fearless spirit of not fearing heaven or earth, they faced numerous difficulties and tried every means to carry on.
    The oil layer conditions of the oilfield were not clear. What to do? The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield understood from Chairman Mao's teachings that the only method was to conduct systematic and thorough investigation and research. They resolutely opposed the past thinking and practices of being superstitious about foreigners and copying foreign books, and focused on grasping first-hand information, and conducting scientific analysis of the very rich and practical first-hand information. In this way, the oil layer conditions of the oilfield were made clear.
    The oilfield construction task was heavy, the time was tight, and manpower, materials, and financial resources were insufficient. What to do? According to Chairman Mao's teachings, instead of dividing troops and dispersing forces, they concentrated superior forces to fight annihilation battles, one battle after another, and achieved one victory after another. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, they adhered to the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality, and concentrated national funds on production and construction. Production and construction strived for high quality, production technology strived for high standards, while living facilities strived for low standards, making do with what was available, and greatly reducing investment in non-productive construction.
    Because the comrades in Daqing closely grasped the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, they drew strength from Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and other works, increased their wisdom, clarified their direction, and found solutions. As a result, contradictions were resolved one by one, difficulties were overcome one by one, and the oilfield was built, and built well, quickly, and economically. Every victory in the construction of the Daqing Oilfield is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for taking class struggle as the key link and conducting extensive and in-depth class education for workers, and a victory for dialectical materialism over metaphysics.
    This is why it is said that the Daqing Oilfield started with "Two Essays."
    Over the past few years, the comrades of the Daqing Oilfield have never interrupted their study of Chairman Mao's works, and have become more and more conscious, more and more in-depth, and more and more effective. When starting a difficult undertaking, they consciously studied; after achieving great victories and receiving great praise, they also consciously studied. In the past two years, they have seriously and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the "two-point theory," followed Chairman Mao's teachings on opposing arrogance and complacency, conservatism, and opposing metaphysics, and constantly used the method of dividing one into two to summarize experience, while affirming achievements, focusing on finding shortcomings, finding inadequacies, and paying attention to overcoming the slackness and arrogance of some people caused by victory. In this way, they are constantly promoted to move forward on the road of revolutionization.
    Emphasize Politics
    The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on man being the decisive factor, on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work," extensively learned from the People's Liberation Army, successfully applied the experience of political work of the People's Liberation Army, adhered to "Four Firsts," carried forward the "Three-Eight Work Style," and placed the work of revolutionizing people in the first place. In political work, they focused on organizing workers to study Chairman Mao's works. They insisted on taking class struggle as the key link, and carried out class education on a large scale at the end of each year; at ordinary times, they focused on conducting ideological work on a person-by-person basis. They attached importance to large-scale commendations and the establishment of model pacesetters; focused on the "Five Goods" movement to strengthen grassroots construction. They fully promoted political, production technology, and economic democracy, and implemented the working method of "from the masses, to the masses." When educating workers, they insisted on focusing on raising ideological awareness, focusing on commendation, focusing on positive persuasion and education, and focusing on mutual self-education among the masses. In this way, the Daqing Oilfield has become a large revolutionary furnace, cultivating and training a revolutionary petroleum industry team with class consciousness, a certain technical literacy, great enthusiasm, a good style, organization and discipline, and the ability to endure hardship and hard work, and fight hard battles. The revolutionization of people, running enterprises with a revolutionary spirit, is precisely the fundamental difference between us and modern revisionists in running enterprises.
    The leadership of the Daqing Oilfield is a revolutionized leadership. They consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems in oilfield construction; consciously used Mao Zedong Thought as the "arrow" to shoot at the non-proletarian thoughts of leading cadres at all levels, and promote the proletarianization of leading cadres at all levels. Over the past few years, the leading cadres at all levels here have adhered to the fine tradition of hard struggle, and do not seek privileges; adhered to participating in physical labor, and do not become bureaucrats; adhered to the style of "Three Honests" and "Four Stricts," and are not arrogant and do not tell lies (Note: "Three Honests" means: be an honest person, tell honest words, and do honest things; "Four Stricts" means: strict requirements, strict organization, strict attitude, and strict discipline); adhered to leading cadres going to the front line in person, and leading organs facing the grassroots, facilitating the grassroots, and serving production. Until now, the offices of the oilfield Party committee, the command headquarters, and the political department, and the dormitories of the leading cadres, are still located in "dried-brick" houses. The workers here highly praise such leadership and trust such leadership. They said: "Following such leadership, we will not go astray." A revolutionized leadership can bring out a revolutionized team.
    The Daqing Oilfield has cultivated a revolutionary technical cadre team of thousands. How to promote the revolutionization of technical cadres? According to their experience: the most fundamental method is to arm technical cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. The transformation of intellectuals requires solving the issue of political stance, as well as the issue of worldview and methodology. Technical cadres livingly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and insist on participating in mass movements and physical labor, which eliminates the bourgeoisie and promotes the proletariat politically, and raises proletarian awareness; they also understand how to learn to use dialectical materialism to solve various technical problems. In this way, their thinking is enlightened, their work becomes smarter, and they learn from foreign good things, but not blindly, they can accept critically, and are no longer bound by the "foreign framework."
    The workers of Daqing are a revolutionized worker team. Many heroic model figures represented by "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi and Zhang Hongchi have emerged here. Heroes emerge in large numbers, red flags are like forests, and "Five Goods" red flag bearers account for about one-third of all employees. They dare to struggle against all difficulties on the road forward, and the more difficult it is, the more enthusiastic they are. They are brave to endure great hardships and heavy labor, and are not afraid in the face of danger. They can unite and help each other, are close and intimate, selfless, and bravely shoulder heavy burdens. In short, they have carried forward a high degree of proletarian revolutionary spirit. Where does the revolutionary spirit come from? The comrades of Daqing said it well: "The revolutionary spirit comes from Mao Zedong Thought." It is precisely under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, that they truly understand how to make revolution, serve the people, embark on the revolutionary road, and carry forward the proletarian revolutionary spirit.
    Scientific Attitude
    The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, have well combined a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude. They have boosted people's revolutionary enthusiasm into scientific research, into grasping first-hand information, into mastering the objective laws of nature, into working solidly, and into production. In this way, they have successfully solved many major problems in production technology and management in the oilfield construction process.
    There are many examples of Daqing people combining revolutionary spirit with a scientific attitude.
    For example, in order to understand the oil layer conditions, they accurately and completely obtained twenty items of data and seventy-two data points for each well they drilled, not one less and not one wrong. At the same time, they also used geological surveys, geophysical exploration, and indoor analysis and testing methods to conduct comprehensive and comprehensive research. They have done hundreds of thousands of rock sample analyses, millions of analyses and tests, and tens of millions of stratigraphic comparisons on raw data before they have a relatively clear understanding of the underground oil layer conditions and gradually figured out the objective laws of oilfield distribution.
    For example, in order to understand the exact proportion of oil and water in the oil layer in its original state, and to accurately calculate the oilfield reserves, female geologist Li Suzhen and a dozen young technical cadres, in the absence of technical data, ate, lived, and worked with the drilling workers, starting from scratch, experimenting bit by bit, fighting against the wind and rain for more than two months, and successively solved three major key issues and one hundred and one difficult problems, creating the technology of using special mud drilling to take rock cores and a set of scientific and rapid analysis and testing methods, obtained accurate data, broke the framework of foreign countries using estimated figures, and made the accuracy of oilfield reserve calculation reach a very high level.
    For example, in order to solve a new downhole operation technology, seven young technicians who had just started working ran all over the oilfield in the wind and rain, traveled hundreds of miles, and collected a large amount of data. However, the design of a key component had not been solved, so they relied on a few pipe wrenches and a hand-cranked winch to drill a test well manually in very poor conditions. In the freezing cold of tens of degrees below zero, they went through more than a thousand experiments, and each time they failed, they looked for the cause and modified the design once, and finally overcame this technical difficulty and solved a major problem in oilfield development.
    In technical innovation and technical revolution, Daqing people dare to break superstitions and create boldly, and follow Chairman Mao's thinking on "dissecting sparrows" and "everything through experimentation." Since 1960, they have opened up a production test area in the oilfield to carry out many scientific and technological innovations and experiments. Over the past few years, they have extensively mobilized the masses, adopted the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, fully promoted technical democracy, followed the mass line, overcame numerous difficulties, and achieved many major scientific and technological achievements. Many new technological achievements are often obtained after hundreds or thousands of experiments.
    A strict scientific attitude is also manifested in their establishment of the "Three Honests," "Four Stricts," and "Four Same" work style everywhere (Note: "Four Same" means: working the same way at night and during the day, working the same way in bad weather and good weather, working the same way when leaders are not present and when leaders are present, and working the same way when no one is checking and when someone is checking); manifested in their consistent serious attitude towards engineering quality; manifested in their establishment and implementation of a strict post responsibility system, implementing thousands of specific tasks in production to tens of thousands of workers, and establishing a scientific and normal production order. In short, people can see their high degree of revolutionary spirit and their strict scientific attitude from all aspects of production and management in the Daqing Oilfield.
    Daqing Road
    Over the past five years, the workers of the Daqing Oilfield, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, livingly studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and solved a series of problems in oilfield construction.
    The construction of the Daqing Oilfield is an example of the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.
    The construction of the Daqing Oilfield is also an example of extensively learning from the People's Liberation Army, adhering to "Four Firsts" and "Three-Eight Work Style," and combining the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army with the actual situation of industrial production and construction.
    The construction of the Daqing Oilfield has consistently adhered to the principle of combining centralized leadership with mass movement, adhered to the principle of combining a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude, adhered to the principle of technical revolution, adhered to the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality, and fully embodies the requirements of the general line for socialist construction: more, faster, better, and more economical.
    Putting politics in command, ideology leading, self-reliance, hard struggle, the Daqing Road is the correct road for China's socialist industrial production and construction.

    大庆——一个活学活用毛泽东思想的范例
    大庆油田建设的每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利，都是以阶级斗争为纲、广泛深入地进行阶级教育的胜利，都是辩证唯物主义对于形而上学的胜利
    大庆油田的职工，在党的领导和各有关方面的关怀和支持之下，从一九六○年到一九六三年，战胜了重重困难，以很快的速度，拿下了这个大油田。一九六四年和一九六五年，油田的生产和建设又取得了新的巨大成就。现在，大庆油田已经建成为我国现代化的石油基地。油田建设的质量是优等的，技术是先进的，经济效果是很好的。大庆油田的建设，全面体现了社会主义建设总路线的多快好省的要求。现在，由于大庆油田的开发和一些新炼油厂的建成，我国经济建设、国防建设和人民生活所需要的石油，不论是在数量或者品种方面，基本上都可以自给了。它标志着我国石油工业的建设进入了一个新的发展时期。“两论”起家
    大庆油田，是党的总路线的产物，是毛泽东思想的产物。大庆油田建设的灵魂，是党的总路线，是毛泽东思想。
    大庆油田的建设是一个活学活用毛泽东思想的范例。油田建设一开始，困难很多，矛盾很多，怎么办？油田党委发出的第一项决定，就是大学毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》。油田建设者人手一册，干部读，工程师读，工人读。他们用毛泽东思想，用阶级斗争的观点，用辩证唯物主义的观点，去分析、研究、解决油田建设中的一系列问题。油田的同志说得好：我们油田是靠“两论起家”（《实践论》和《矛盾论》）的。
    当时的矛盾和困难是什么？大庆油田的同志又是怎样运用毛泽东思想，运用“两论”去解决这些矛盾和困难？
    美帝国主义从经济上封锁我们，现代修正主义者想在石油问题上卡我们的脖子，我们自己又缺乏经验，怎么办？大庆油田的同志从毛主席的教导中，懂得了这是一场国际范围的你死我活的阶级斗争。帝国主义和修正主义者要在石油上卡我们，扼杀我们，我们一定要粉碎他们的阴谋诡计，一定要更加奋发图强，自力更生，做到石油自给。他们的口号是：“井场就是反帝反修的战场”。他们的抱负是：“要用自己的双手摘掉石油工业落后的帽子”，“要让那些想在石油上卡我们的人遭到可耻的失败”。
    外国的一些专家制造了一种“理论”，叫做“中国贫油论”。这些人说：“中国大部分地区的岩石类型与生成时代都没有储存有开采价值的石油的可能”。怎么办？是迷信这种“洋框框”而无所作为，还是打破这种“洋框框”的束缚？大庆油田的同志从毛主席的教导中，懂得了真正的理论只能是“从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论”，懂得了“人的认识一点也不能离开实践”，坚决反掉那种只凭死书本，迷信“洋框框”的主观主义的、形而上学的观点。这样，他们就敢于革命，勇于实践。我们的地质工作者，在自己的理论的指导下，从我国实际情况出发，选好一个地区，集中优势力量进行勘探。结果证明，在我国的地质条件下，不但能找到油田，而且能找到大油田。所谓“中国贫油论”破产了。
    几万人一下拥到一个大草原，“上面青天一顶，下面草原一片”，生活很艰苦，天寒地冻，一无房屋，二无床铺，连锅灶、用具都很不够，生产的条件也很困难。在这种情况下，到底是迎着困难上去，还是退下来？大庆油田的同志遵从毛主席《矛盾论》的教导，对各种困难和矛盾进行了反复研究，认为从国家的整体利益、长远利益来看，迎着困难而上，无非是多流些汗，多吃些苦，这是局部的、第二位的困难；如果畏难而退，国家没有油，这是根本的、第一位的困难。他们懂得“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”，懂得“条件可以边做边准备”，懂得干革命就要有“愚公移山”的革命英雄气概，就要能吃大苦，耐大劳，这是一个要不要以无产阶级革命精神对待革命中的艰苦和困难的问题。这样，他们就以天不怕、地不怕的大无畏精神，迎着重重困难，千方百计地搞了上去。
    油田的油层情况摸不清楚，怎么办？大庆油田的同志从毛主席的教导中，懂得了唯一的方法就是作系统的周密的调查和研究。他们坚决反掉过去那种迷信洋人、死抄洋书的思想和做法，大抓第一性资料，对十分丰富和出于实际的第一性资料进行科学分析。这样，就把油田的油层情况搞得清清楚楚。
    油田建设任务重，时间紧，人力物力财力不足，怎么办？他们按照毛主席的教导，不是分兵把口，分散力量，而是集中优势力量打歼灭战，一个仗一个仗的打，取得一个又一个的胜利。他们按照毛主席的教导，坚持勤俭建国的原则，把国家资金集中用到生产建设中去。生产建设力求高质量，生产技术力求高水平，而生活设施则力求低标准，因陋就简，大大降低了非生产建设的投资。
    由于大庆的同志们紧紧抓住了活学活用毛泽东思想，就从毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》以及其它著作中，汲取了力量，增长了智慧，明确了方向，找到了办法。结果，矛盾一个一个被解决，困难一个一个被克服，把油田建设起来，并且建设得又好又快又省。大庆油田建设的每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利，都是以阶级斗争为纲、对职工广泛深入地进行阶级教育的胜利，都是辩证唯物主义对于形而上学的胜利。
    这就是为什么说大庆油田是靠“两论”起家的。
    几年来，大庆油田同志们，学习毛主席著作从不间断，而且，越来越自觉，越来越深入，越来越有成效。在艰苦创业的时候，他们自觉地学；在取得大胜利、受到大表扬以后，他们也自觉地学。最近两年，他们认真地反复地学习毛主席关于“两分法”的指示，遵循毛主席关于反对骄傲自满、故步自封，反对形而上学的教导，不断用一分为二的方法总结经验，在肯定成绩的同时，着重找出缺点，找出不足之处，注意克服有些人因胜利产生的松劲情绪、骄傲情绪。这样，就促使他们在革命化的道路上不断前进。突出政治
    大庆油田的同志们，按照毛主席关于人是决定性因素的教导，关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，大学解放军，成功地运用了解放军政治工作的经验，坚持“四个第一”，发扬“三八作风”，把做人的革命化的工作放在第一位。在政治工作中，他们狠抓组织职工学习毛主席著作。他们坚持以阶级斗争为纲，每年年底大张旗鼓地进行阶级教育；平时则抓紧进行一人一事的活的思想工作。他们重视大表扬、大树标兵；狠抓“五好”运动，加强基层建设。他们充分发扬政治、生产技术和经济民主，贯彻“从群众中来到群众中去”的工作方法。他们对职工进行教育的时候，坚持以提高思想觉悟为主，以表扬为主，以正面说服教育为主，以群众的相互自我教育为主。这样，就使大庆油田成了一个革命的大熔炉，培养、锻炼出了一支有阶级觉悟，有一定技术素养，干劲大，作风好，有组织有纪律，能吃苦耐劳，能打硬仗的革命化的石油工业队伍。人的革命化，以革命精神办企业，这正是我们同现代修正主义者办企业的根本差别所在。
    大庆油田的领导是革命化的领导。他们自觉地运用毛泽东思想，去解决油田建设中的问题；自觉地以毛泽东思想之“矢”，去射各级领导干部的非无产阶级思想之“的”，促进各级领导干部的无产阶级化。几年来，这里的各级领导干部坚持了艰苦奋斗的优良传统，不特殊化；坚持了参加体力劳动，不做官老爷；坚持了“三老”、“四严”的作风，不骄傲，不说假话（注：“三老”就是：当老实人，说老实话，做老实事；“四严”就是：严格的要求，严密的组织，严肃的态度，严明的纪律）；坚持了领导干部亲临前线，领导机关面向基层，方便基层，为生产服务。直到现在，油田党委和指挥部、政治部的办公室，领导干部的宿舍，仍然设在“干打垒”的土房里。这里的工人很称赞这样的领导，信任这样的领导。他们说：“跟着这样的领导，就不会走错路。”革命化的领导，才能带出革命化的队伍。
    大庆油田培养出一支数以千计的革命化的技术干部队伍。怎样促使技术干部革命化？根据他们的经验：最根本的办法，是用毛泽东思想武装技术干部。知识分子的改造，要解决政治立场问题，也要解决宇宙观和思想方法问题。技术干部活学活用毛主席著作，并且坚持参加群众运动，参加体力劳动，就从政治上兴无灭资，提高了无产阶级觉悟；也懂得学习用辩证唯物主义去解决各种技术问题。这样，思想就开窍了，做起工作来也变得聪明了，对于外国的好东西，要学，但不是照搬，能够批判地接受，不再受“洋框框”的束缚。
    大庆的工人是一支革命化的工人队伍。这里涌现出许多以“铁人”王进喜和张洪池等为代表的英雄模范人物。真是英雄辈出，红旗如林，“五好”红旗手约占全体职工的三分之一。他们敢于同前进道路上的一切困难作斗争，越是困难，干劲越足。他们勇于吃大苦，耐大劳，临危不惧。他们能团结互助，亲密无间，公而忘私，勇挑重担。总之，他们发扬了高度的无产阶级的革命精神。革命精神从那里来？大庆的同志说得好：“革命精神来自于毛泽东思想”。正是在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的实践中，使他们真正懂得了为革命，为人民，走上了革命化的道路，发扬了无产阶级的革命精神。科学态度
    大庆油田的同志们，按照毛主席的教导，把高度的革命精神同严格的科学态度很好地结合起来。他们把人的革命干劲鼓到科学研究上去，鼓到抓第一性资料上去，鼓到掌握自然界的客观规律上去，鼓到扎扎实实地工作上去，鼓到生产上去。这样，就在油田建设过程中，成功地解决了生产技术和管理上的许多重大问题。
    大庆人把革命精神同科学态度结合得很好的事例是很多的。
    例如：为了搞清油层情况，他们每打一口井，都要准确齐全地取得二十项资料，七十二个数据，一个不能少，一点不能错。同时，他们还采用地质调查、地球物理勘探、以及室内分析化验等方法，作全面的、综合研究。他们对原始资料做过几十万个岩样分析，几百万次分析化验，几千万次地层对比，才把地下油层的情况，搞得比较清楚，逐步摸清油田分布的客观规律。
    例如：为了了解油层在原始状态下含油、含水的准确比例，算准油田储量，女地质师李素贞和十几个青年技术干部，在缺乏技术资料的情况下，和钻井工人同吃同住同劳动，从头做起，一点一滴试验，顶风冒雨奋战两个多月，先后解决了三大关键和一百零一个疑难问题，创造了用特种泥浆钻井取岩心的技术和一套科学的快速分析化验方法，取得了准确数据，打破了国外采用估计数字的框框，使油田储量计算的准确度达到了很高的水平。
    例如：为了解决一种新的井下作业技术，七名刚参加工作的青年技术人员，顶风冒雨，跑遍了整个油田，走了几百里地，收集了大量的资料数据。但是，还有一个关键部件的设计没有解决，他们就在条件很差的情况下，靠几把管钳，一部手摇绞车，用人力打了一口试验井，在零下几十度的严寒里，前后经过一千多次试验，每失败一次，就找一次原因，修改一次设计，终于攻克了这个技术难关，解决了油田开发中的一个大问题。
    大庆人在技术革新和技术革命中，既敢于破除迷信，大胆创造，又遵循毛主席关于“解剖麻雀”和“一切经过试验”的思想。从一九六○年起，他们就在油田中开辟了一个生产试验区，进行许多科学技术的革新和试验工作。几年来，他们广泛地发动群众，采取了领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的办法，充分发扬技术民主，走群众路线，克服了重重困难，取得了很多重大的科学技术成就。很多新的技术成就，常常是经过上百次、上千次的试验，才获得了成功。
    严格的科学态度，还表现在他们处处事事树立起“三老”、“四严”、“四个一样”的作风（注：“四个一样”就是：黑夜和白天干工作一个样，坏天气和好天气干工作一个样，领导不在场和领导在场干工作一个样，没有人检查和有人检查干工作一个样）；表现在他们对工程质量始终采取一丝不苟的严肃态度；表现在他们建立和贯彻了严格的岗位责任制，把生产上千千万万件具体工作落实到成千上万工人的身上，建立了科学的正常的生产秩序。总之，人们从大庆油田的生产、管理的各个工作环节上，都可以看到他们的高度的革命精神，也可以看到他们的严格的科学态度。大庆道路
    五年来，大庆油田职工们，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，解决了油田建设中的一系列问题。
    大庆油田的建设是一个活学活用毛泽东思想的范例。
    大庆油田的建设也是大学解放军，坚持“四个第一”和“三八作风”，把解放军的政治工作经验同工业生产建设的实际结合起来的范例。
    大庆油田的建设，自始至终坚持了集中领导同群众运动相结合的原则，坚持了高度革命精神同严格科学态度相结合的原则，坚持了技术革命的原则，坚持了勤俭建国的原则，全面体现了社会主义建设总路线的多快好省的要求。
    政治挂帅，思想领先，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，大庆的道路是我国社会主义工业生产建设的正确道路。
