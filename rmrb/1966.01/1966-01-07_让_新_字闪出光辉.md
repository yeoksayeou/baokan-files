    Let the Word "New" Shine
    The word "new" should be linked with revolutionary vigor and revolutionary drive; but "new" often becomes a burden that some comrades dare not act upon. Shedding it allows for unburdened progress.
    Among the members of the county party committee standing committee, I am a newcomer, and most of the standing committee members were my former superiors. For a period of time, firstly, I felt my level was low, and secondly, I felt my seniority was short. Because the word "new" was buried in my heart, I relaxed my strict demands on myself and did not fulfill the responsibilities that a party committee member should. This was mainly manifested in party committee meetings. When discussing issues related to the work I was assigned to, I considered it my "duty" and did not shirk responsibility, carefully considering and actively expressing my opinions. However, for issues not directly related to me, sometimes I didn't understand the situation and didn't know where to start. Sometimes, although I had something to say, I was afraid of speaking inaccurately. In the end, I considered it other people's business and simply or even blindly echoed their opinions, unwilling to elaborate on my own understanding. Here, I linked the word "new" with personal selfishness and laziness, so I did not play the role of a newcomer in the county party committee.
    Party leadership is collective leadership. As a party committee member, one should not only do a good job in the work assigned to individuals by the party committee, but also actively participate in collective leadership. How can a party committee member play their role in collective leadership? My personal experience: the key is to first "operate" on one's own thinking, cutting away all distractions that hinder the role of collective leadership, and caring about the overall work. Only in this way can one actively study and seriously discuss the work of the party committee, while adhering to principles, upholding the truth, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Only when party committee members actively and proactively express their opinions on every issue can problems be studied and discussed in depth from all aspects and angles, correct conclusions drawn, thoughts unified, actions unified, and efforts combined to do a good job in production and construction. If county party committee members were all like I once was, the members would become a mere formality, and the party committee would become a stagnant pool. How could we talk about implementing democratic centralism and leading the people of the county to do a good job in production and construction with a revolutionary spirit?

    让“新”字闪出光辉
    “新”字应该同革命的朝气、革命的干劲联系在一起；但“新”也往往成为一些同志不敢行动的包袱，甩掉它，就能轻装前进
    在县委常委中，我是个新兵，常委多数同志都是我的老上级。有一段时间，我一来感到水平低，二来觉得资历短，又因为有个“新”（委员）字埋在心里，就放松了对自己的严格要求，没有尽到党委委员应尽的职责。主要表现在党委会议上，对于讨论自己分工负责的工作问题时，我认为是“份内”之事，责无旁贷，还认真考虑，积极发表意见。但对于与自己没有直接联系的问题，有时不了解情况，不知从那里说起；有时虽有话想说，但又怕讲的不准，最后，认为是其他人的事，便简单甚至盲目附议他人意见，而不愿详述自己的认识。我在这里把“新”字同个人的私心、懒惰联在一起了，所以在县委中没有发挥作为一个新兵的作用。
    党的领导是集体领导。作为党委委员，不仅应该作好党委分工给个人的工作，还必须积极参加集体领导。党委委员如何发挥他在集体领导中的作用？我个人体会：关键是先从自己思想上“开刀”，割去有碍发挥集体领导作用的一切杂念，关心全面工作，这样才能做到对党委会的工作积极钻研，认真讨论，同时坚持原则，坚持真理，开展批评和自我批评。只有党委委员在每个问题上都积极主动发表意见，才便于从各个方面各个角度来深入研究和讨论问题，得出正确的结论，统一思想，统一行动，合力搞好工作。县委委员都要象我自己一度表现的那样，委员就成了虚设，党委会也会变为一潭死水，那里还谈得上执行民主集中制，怎么能以革命的精神带领全县人民搞好生产建设事业呢？
