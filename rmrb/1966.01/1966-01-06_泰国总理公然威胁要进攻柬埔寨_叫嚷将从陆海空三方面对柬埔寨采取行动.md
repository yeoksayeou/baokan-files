    Xinhua News Agency, January 5th, Bangkok dispatch: Coordinating with the US imperialists' plot to expand the war of aggression in Indochina, high-ranking Thai military and government officials have recently been publicly issuing war threats against Cambodia. While the Thai army is infringing upon Cambodia, it is also conducting "exercises" and "alerts" in areas near the Thai-Cambodian border.
    According to Western news agencies, Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn openly clamored at a cabinet meeting on the 5th that Thailand will take "vigorous retaliatory actions" against Cambodia from land, sea, and air.
    At the same time, the Thai authorities announced that the Thai Army's 1st Division will conduct live-fire exercises in Prachinburi Province, which is adjacent to the Cambodian border, from January 9th to 25th. The exercise area will be declared a "restricted area."
    Before Thanom issued this war threat against Cambodia, Thai Deputy Minister of Defense Thawi said on the 3rd that he had, in accordance with Prime Minister Thanom's instructions, ordered the Thai Navy, Army, and Air Force to be on strict "alert" along the Thai-Cambodian border and authorized them to take military action against Cambodia. He also said that he had mobilized the Marine Corps and increased the number of border police in the Thai-Cambodian border area.
    Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Praphas Charusathien said on the 4th that the Thai warship "Sukhothai" was "patrolling" near Cambodian waters.
    These war cries and military actions against Cambodia by the Thai puppet clique have intensified since Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman recently went to Manila, the capital of the Philippines, to discuss US-Thai military collusion with US Vice President Humphrey. It is reported that Humphrey told Khoman that the Johnson administration will conduct "effective" "cooperation" with Thailand to "maintain peace and freedom in the Southeast Asian region."

    泰国总理公然威胁要进攻柬埔寨
    叫嚷将从陆海空三方面对柬埔寨采取行动
    新华社五日讯　曼谷消息：配合着美帝国主义扩大侵略印度支那战争的阴谋，泰国高级军政官员最近连续公开对柬埔寨发出战争威胁。泰国的军队在侵犯柬埔寨的同时，还在邻近泰柬边境的地区进行“演习”和“戒备”。
    据西方通讯社报道，泰国总理他侬五日在内阁会议上公然叫嚷，泰国将从陆、海、空三方面对柬埔寨采取“强有力的报复行动”。
    与此同时，泰国当局宣布，泰国陆军第一师将从一月九日到二十五日在紧接柬埔寨边境的巴真武里府举行实弹演习。演习地区将被宣布为“禁区”。
    在他侬发出这次对柬埔寨的战争威胁之前，泰国国防部副部长他威在三日说，他已经按照总理他侬的指示，命令泰国海、陆、空三军沿泰柬边境作严密“戒备”，并且授权他们对柬埔寨采取军事行动。他还说，已经调动海军陆战队和增调边防警察到泰柬边境地区。
    泰国副总理兼陆军总司令巴博在四日说，泰国军舰“苏基普号”正在柬埔寨海域附近“巡逻”。
    泰国傀儡集团的这些针对柬埔寨的战争叫嚣和军事行动，是在泰国外交部长科曼最近到菲律宾首都马尼拉同美国副总统汉弗莱讨论了美泰军事勾结问题以后加紧起来的。据报道，汉弗莱对科曼说，约翰逊政府将同泰国进行“有成效”的“合作”，来“维护东南亚地区的和平和自由”。
