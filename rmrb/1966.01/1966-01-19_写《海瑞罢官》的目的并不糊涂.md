    The Purpose of Writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Was Not Confused
    Cao Zizhi
    Comrade Wu Han said in his "self-criticism" that the reason his position was wrong was because, "In a word, ... I forgot about class struggle!"
    Did Comrade Wu Han really forget about class struggle? Let's still look for answers from social practice. From 1959 to 1961, our country encountered temporary economic difficulties, and foreign class enemies frantically opposed China. The domestic bourgeoisie also launched attacks on socialism from the political, economic, and ideological fronts. Echoing these attacks, a countercurrent also appeared on our literary and artistic front. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is precisely a component of this countercurrent. It expresses sympathy and support for right-leaning opportunists, which cannot be said to be a purely academic issue, but is closely related to political issues.
    Comrade Wu Han said: "What was the purpose of writing this play? At the time, it was not clear, it was confused... The principle of 'using the past for the present, emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past' was not thought of at all at the time. It was completely for the sake of the past, for the sake of writing a play, detached from politics and detached from reality." Is this really the case? In a series of speeches and articles, Comrade Wu Han repeatedly emphasized the practical role of studying history and writing historical dramas. In the preface to the rewritten historical drama, he also said that Hai Rui's "some good virtues are also worth learning from today." All this shows that Comrade Wu Han never forgot the principles of "using the past for the present" and "real political significance" at any time. We hope that Comrade Wu Han will examine his writing motives from his political attitude at that time.

    写《海瑞罢官》的目的并不糊涂
    曹佐治
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中说，自己的立场所以错了，是因为“一句话，……忘记了阶级斗争！”
    吴晗同志真地忘记了阶级斗争吗？我们还是从社会实践中去找答案吧。一九五九到一九六一年，我们国内遭到暂时的经济困难，国外阶级敌人疯狂反华。国内资产阶级也从政治、经济、思想各个战线上向社会主义发动进攻。同这些进攻相呼应，我们的文艺战线也出现了一股逆流。《海瑞罢官》正是这股逆流的组成部分。它对右倾机会主义者表示同情和支持，这不能说是纯学术问题，而是与政治问题有密切联系的。
    吴晗同志说：“写这个剧本的目的性是什么，在当时是不清楚的，糊涂的，……‘古为今用，厚今薄古’的原则在当时一点也没有想起过，完全是为古而古，为写戏而写戏，脱离了政治，脱离了现实。”真是这样吗？吴晗同志在一系列讲话和文章中，再三强调研究历史与写历史剧的现实作用。他在改写这一历史剧的前言中也说：海瑞“一些好的品德，也是值得我们今天学习的”。这些都说明了吴晗同志任何时候，都没有忘记“古为今用”，“现实政治意义”这些原则。我们希望，吴晗同志还是从自己当时的政治态度来检验自己的写作动机吧。
