    Mao Zedong Thought Guides Us to Victory
    Squadron Leader of a Certain Air Force Unit of the People's Liberation Army Dong Xiaohai
    At the beginning of last year, our squadron was carrying out combat missions in a certain area. Because we hadn't fought for a long time, we were afraid that our skills would be rusty and that we wouldn't be able to complete the task. Therefore, we worked hard to prepare for combat tactics and techniques, placing tactical and technical preparation in the primary position. But as time went on, "impatience" began to show, and "slackness" began to appear, and more and more problems arose. Just at this time, Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on giving prominence to politics came down, which made us clear-headed: among all combat preparations, the primary one is ideological preparation. We organized the pilots to study Chairman Mao's expositions on the nature of imperialism, analyze the activity patterns of enemy aircraft, recognize the situation of the struggle, and strengthen our concept of the enemy. Thus, we achieved both constant ideological preparedness and constant specific preparations, thereby creating favorable conditions for shooting down enemy aircraft.
    On the issue of annihilating the enemy in close combat, at first some comrades were afraid of colliding with enemy aircraft during close combat. We studied Chairman Mao's exposition on "initiative in war," used the dialectical method to conduct a detailed analysis of the relationship between close combat and collision, established the heroic spirit of not fearing sacrifice and the idea of being good at "annihilating the enemy and preserving ourselves," and worked hard to practice close combat skills, thereby overcoming the concerns about collisions and greatly enhancing the confidence in annihilating the enemy in close combat. For example, in a battle last year, when I spotted the enemy aircraft, boundless class hatred surged into my heart. At this time, there were only three words in my mind: "hate," "fight," and "win." I increased my speed to approach the enemy aircraft, and when I reached a distance of two hundred meters, I pressed the cannon button and shot down the enemy aircraft.
    In battle, unexpected difficulties often arise. For example, in a battle, when Comrade Gao Changji was chasing an enemy aircraft, the aircraft's afterburner system suddenly failed, and the enemy that was about to be captured would escape. What to do? He thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "It often happens that a favorable situation and the initiative are gained as a result of ‘holding out a little longer.’" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, page 403) So Gao Changji quickly eliminated the fault, chased the enemy closely, and fired a burst of shells, finally shooting down the enemy aircraft.
    The practice of the past year has made us deeply realize that giving prominence to politics, with Mao Zedong Thought in command, leads to invincibility. This is an absolutely true truth. In 1966, we must resolutely implement the five principles put forward by Vice Chairman Lin, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and especially work hard on the word "apply," always, at all times, and in all things, regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all work, and strive to achieve greater victories in combat.

    毛泽东思想指导我们打胜仗
    解放军空军某部中队长  董小海
    去年年初，我们中队在某地执行作战任务，由于好久没打仗了，生怕技术生疏，完不成任务，于是狠抓战术技术准备，把战术技术准备放在首要位置。可是时间一长，“急”字露头，“松”字开始，问题越来越多。正在这时，林副主席关于突出政治的指示下来了，使我们清醒了头脑：各项战斗准备中，首要的是思想准备。我们就组织飞行员学习毛主席有关帝国主义本性的论述，分析敌机活动规律，认清斗争形势，加强了敌情观念。因而做到了既有常备不懈的思想，又有常备不懈的具体准备，从而为击落敌机创造了良好的条件。
    在近战歼敌问题上，开始有些同志怕在近战时跟敌机相撞。我们学习了毛主席关于“能动性在战争中”的论述，运用辩证方法，对近战和相撞的关系问题，进行详细的分析，树立了不怕牺牲的英雄气概和善于“消灭敌人，保存自己”的思想，又苦练近战本领，从而克服了怕相撞的顾虑，大大增强了近战歼敌的信心。如我在去年的一次战斗中，发现敌机的时候，无限的阶级仇恨一下子涌上心头，这时思想上只有“恨”、“打”、“胜”三个字。我加大速度抵近敌机，到了二百米的距离，猛按炮钮，就把敌机打下来了。
    在战斗中，经常出现意想不到的困难。如高长吉同志在一次战斗中，当他猛追敌机的时候，忽然飞机的加力系统发生了故障，眼看到手的敌人就会逃掉。怎么办？他想起了毛主席这样的教导：“往往有这种情形，有利的情况和主动的恢复，产生于‘再坚持一下’的努力之中。”（《毛泽东选集》第四○三页）于是高长吉迅速排除了故障，紧追敌人不放，长射一顿炮弹，终于把敌机击落。
    一年来的实践，使我们深深体会到，突出政治，毛泽东思想挂了帅，就无往而不胜。这是千真万确的真理。一九六六年，我们一定坚决贯彻林副主席提出的五项原则，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫，处处、时时、事事把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，争取在作战中取得更大的胜利。
