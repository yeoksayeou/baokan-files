Title: Remember: Always Integrate with the Herdsmen

    What is revolutionary spirit? The comrades of Fuhai County gave a very concrete answer with facts. The cadres of the county committee who lead animal husbandry spend more than ten months a year in the deep mountain pastures, eating, living, and consulting with the herdsmen, and leading animal husbandry production to achieve stable increases in production year after year under extremely difficult working conditions.
    In comparison with the work in our county, I believe that being with the local masses at all times should be a rather important aspect of realizing the revolutionary transformation of the county committee leadership.
    Fuhai is a county in the Altai Mountains that is mainly engaged in animal husbandry and combines agriculture and animal husbandry. The pastures here are vast, the routes for livestock migration are as long as seven or eight hundred kilometers, and animal husbandry production is greatly affected by natural conditions. In the past, the leading cadres of the county committee did not frequently go deep into the pastoral areas and integrate with the herdsmen, and they did not solve some important problems in production in a timely manner. In the spring of 1960, there was a snowstorm that was rare in decades, and the livestock suffered relatively large losses. We learned from this lesson, improved the general leadership method of the county committee for animal husbandry production, established two sets of teams to lead animal husbandry and agricultural production, and equipped them with several relatively strong responsible cadres to specifically lead animal husbandry production. Since then, our animal husbandry office has not been located in the county seat far away from the pastures, but on the pastures. Wherever the livestock moved, the animal husbandry office moved there; wherever the herdsmen grazed, the animal husbandry cadres participated in and led production there. Since 1960, these animal husbandry cadres, including leading cadres, have lived on the pastures for more than ten months of the year, sharing weal and woe with the vast number of herdsmen, and truly integrating with them. (Editor's note: Not simple! The cadres who lead animal husbandry can spend more than ten months of the year living on the pastures, sharing weal and woe with the herdsmen. I wonder how much time the county committee leaders in other mountainous, pastoral, and forestry areas spend living with the masses they lead in a year?) On the summer pastures of the towering Altai Mountains, these cadres often ride horses for hundreds of kilometers, traversing dozens of mountains, to inspect nearly a thousand herds of livestock throughout the county. On the winter pastures inside the Kurbantungut Desert, which was called "once you go in, you can't get out" by the predecessors, these cadres also always live with the herdsmen, resisting wind, snow, and severe cold, and protecting the livestock to safely winter and spring. When surveying the winter pastures every early winter, the leading cadres of the animal husbandry office carry dry rations in their arms, eat some snow when they are thirsty, and lead the commune cadres and experienced herdsmen to ride horses in the desert for more than twenty days. During the day, they inspect the pastures in the desert and arrange the livestock; at night, they gather a fire and sleep on the barren beaches. (Editor's note: Without ardent class feelings and a strong revolutionary sense of responsibility, it is not easy for cadres to do this.)
    In order to more directly understand the sufferings of the herdsmen masses and correctly direct animal husbandry production, most of the cadres of the county committee who led animal husbandry production learned the Kazakh language, became accustomed to the lifestyle on the grasslands, made friends with many poor herdsmen and teachers, mastered the laws of animal husbandry production, and solved some major problems in a timely manner, so that the county's animal husbandry production achieved stable increases year after year. Although the grasslands have been hit by drought and snowstorms every year for the past five years, our cadres have led the herdsmen masses to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, overcome one difficulty after another, and win one victory after another. In 1965, the total number of livestock of all kinds in our county had increased by about eight times compared with the early days of liberation.
    However, our county committee is not complacent because of this. At present, our county is building a large canal eighty kilometers long on the upper reaches of the Ertix River. After this canal is completed, the irrigation area of ​​farmland and pastures will be multiplied. On the northern edge of the Junggar Basin, we plan to build a number of vertical shafts to grow more and better pasture on the Gobi Desert. The tasks before us are still very arduous, but we believe that as long as we dare to make revolution, integrate with the local herdsmen masses at all times, participate in production and lead production, we can push our county's animal husbandry production to a new peak.

    记住：永远和牧民打成一片
    什么叫革命精神？福海县的同志用事实作了很具体的回答。县委领导牧业的干部一年有十个月以上在深山牧场和牧民同吃同住同商量，在极艰苦的工作条件下领导牧业生产连年获得稳定增产
    对照本县工作，我认为：时时刻刻和当地群众打成一片，应当是实现县委领导革命化中相当重要的一条。
    福海是阿尔泰山区一个以牧为主、农牧结合的县份。这里牧场辽阔，牲畜转场路线长达七八百公里，牧业生产受自然条件的影响很大。从前，县委领导干部没有经常深入牧区和牧民打成一片，没有及时解决生产中的一些重要问题。一九六○年春天，发生了一场几十年来少见的大风雪，畜群遭到比较大的损失。我们吸取了这次教训，改进了县委对牧业生产一般化的领导方法，建立了领导牧业和农业生产的两套班子，并配备了几名比较强的负责干部，专门领导牧业生产。从此，我们的牧业办公室不是设在远离牧场的县城，而是设在牧场上。畜群转移到那里，牧业办公室就搬到那里；牧民在那里放牧，牧业干部就在那里参加生产，领导生产。从一九六○年以来，这批牧业干部包括领导干部在内，一年中都有十个月以上的时间生活在牧场上，和广大牧民同甘苦，共患难，真正打成一片。（编者按：不简单！领导牧业的干部一年能有十个月以上的时间在牧场上与牧民同甘苦，共患难，不知其他山区、牧区、林区的县委领导同志一年有多少时间与自己领导的群众生活在一起？）在峰峦重迭的阿尔泰高山夏牧场上，这些干部经常骑马跋涉几百公里，翻越几十座大山，查看全县近千群牲畜。在被前人称为“进去出不来”的库尔班通古特大沙漠里边的冬牧场上，这些干部也始终同牧民生活在一起，抗御风雪严寒，保护畜群安全越冬度春。在每年初冬勘察冬牧场的时候，牧业办公室的领导干部怀中揣着干馕，渴了就吃点雪，带领公社干部和有经验的牧民，在沙漠里骑马走二十多天。白天，在沙漠中查看草场，安排畜群，晚上就拢一把火，睡在荒滩上。（编者按：没有火热的阶级感情，没有强烈的革命事业心，干部要做到这样是不容易的。）
    为了更直接地了解牧民群众的疾苦，正确地指挥牧业生产，县委领导牧业生产的干部大部分都学会了哈萨克语，习惯了草原上的一套生活方式，结识了许多贫苦出身的牧民朋友和老师，掌握了牧业生产的规律，及时解决了一些重大问题，使全县畜牧业生产年年获得稳定增产。虽然最近五年，草原年年受到干旱和暴风雪的袭击，我们的干部领导着牧民群众，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，战胜一个又一个的困难，夺得一个又一个的胜利。一九六五年，我县各类牲畜总头数已经比解放初期增加了八倍左右。
    但是，我们县委没有因此而陶醉，目前我县正在额尔齐斯河上游修建一条长达八十公里的大渠，这条大渠建成后，农田和草场的灌溉面积将有成倍的增长。在准噶尔盆地北缘，我们计划修建一批竖井，使戈壁滩上长出更多更好的牧草。摆在我们面前的任务还很艰巨，但是，我们相信只要我们敢于革命，时时刻刻和当地牧民群众打成一片，参加生产领导生产，就能把我县的畜牧业生产推向一个新的高峰。
