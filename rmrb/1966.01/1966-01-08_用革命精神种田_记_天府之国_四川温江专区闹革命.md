    Farming with Revolutionary Spirit
    —A Record of the Revolution in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance"
    Editor's Note: Sichuan is a major grain-producing province that makes a significant contribution to the country. Wenjiang Prefecture has historically provided the most commodity grain in the province. The contribution of the Wenjiang people to our country is worthy of praise.
    In the past two years, during the Socialist Education Movement and inspired by the Dazhai spirit, the people of Wenjiang have further enhanced their class consciousness and developed a revolutionary spirit, consciously sweeping away their complacency and resolving to make greater contributions to the revolution. They rightly say: "Dazhai has made such great contributions and still feels it is not enough. We cannot let good conditions blind us." They rightly say: "For the revolution, we, in such a prosperous place, should redouble our efforts and dare to shoulder heavy burdens." They rightly say: "Farming is for the revolution. How can we in 'Golden Wenjiang' only get 500 or 600 jin of grain per mu from such good land?" With the idea of farming for the revolution established, and farming carried out with a revolutionary spirit, the "stable but not advancing" production situation has been broken, and production has greatly advanced.
    The experience of Wenjiang Prefecture once again tells us that in our country, whether in areas with good or poor natural conditions, whether in high-yield or low-yield areas, there is great potential and much to be done. To tap this potential for increased production, the most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to raise people's revolutionary consciousness. When people have a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, they can maximize their enthusiasm, persevere in the struggle against nature, strive to turn low-yield into high-yield, and high-yield into higher-yield, never stopping and always moving forward.
    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, places with poor mountains and harsh waters are making revolution, and fertile plains are also making revolution.
    In recent years, the prosperous Wenjiang Prefecture in Sichuan Province has been forging ahead on the road of revolution and has made remarkable achievements.
    Can a prosperous high-yield area become even higher-yield? The fact is that Wenjiang Prefecture has broken through the "stable but not advancing" production situation and is striding forward. Here, various crops reached and approached historical highs in 1964; in 1965, rice, rapeseed, and wheat increased by 10%, 23%, and 27% respectively. The 500,000 mu of wheat demonstration fields increased by 40% on the original basis, 70% higher than the average mu yield of the entire prefecture in 1964.
    Does a high-yield area need a large amount of national investment and a sufficient supply of chemical fertilizers to become even higher-yield? The fact is that Wenjiang Prefecture did not ask the state to increase investment much, nor did it rely on chemical fertilizer supply, but relied on collective strength to develop production through self-reliance. In 1964, the average chemical fertilizer supplied by the state per mu of cultivated land was less than 8 jin, and even less in 1965. They mainly solved the fertilizer shortage by planting more green manure, developing pig farming, accumulating natural fertilizers, and investing in the construction of small-scale fertilizer plants by the communes and teams themselves. Now, on average, there is one pig for every one and a half agricultural people in the entire prefecture. In the past two years, Wenjiang Prefecture has transformed more than 400,000 mu of low-yield dead yellow mud, white alkali mud, coarse sandy soil, and waterlogged fields, and basically did not require national investment.
    A plain area with a large population and little land is not unable to breed cattle and plant trees on a large scale. In the past three years, Wenjiang Prefecture has unprecedentedly bred 40,000 cattle; in two years, the entire prefecture has planted more than 120,000 mu of trees, and more than 200 million scattered trees, and rows of trees have appeared along rivers, roads, and fields.
    The people of Wenjiang Prefecture have never lagged behind in supporting the country's socialist construction. Over the years, the commodity grain and oil provided has been the highest in the province.
    "Without the interests of the whole country, there is no local interest; without the prosperity of the whole, there is no partial prosperity. For the revolution, we, in such a prosperous place, should redouble our efforts and dare to shoulder heavy burdens." This is the driving force for the Wenjiang people to make revolution.
      "Stop" or "Revolutionize"?
    Wenjiang Prefecture is a rare large plain in the mountainous southwest region of the motherland. The climate here is mild, evergreen all year round; the land is fertile and the products are abundant. The "Land of Abundance" recorded in ancient books refers to this place.
    After liberation, land reform, agricultural cooperativization, and communization movements were carried out here, giving full play to the people's revolutionary enthusiasm, making the people's "Land of Abundance" more and more prosperous year by year. The ancient Dujiangyan, after experiencing 2,200 years before liberation, had a maximum irrigation area of only 3 million mu, but now it has expanded to more than 6 million mu, and the output of various crops has increased.
    However, after the production of Wenjiang Prefecture developed to a certain stage, some people developed a complacent mood of being content with the status quo and stopped moving forward. They were satisfied with five things: satisfied with the fact that all work was "okay," satisfied with the fact that they "completed the national tasks" every year, satisfied with the fact that "production exceeded that of wealthy peasants in the past," satisfied with the fact that "each person was allocated 500 jin of food grain," and satisfied with the fact that "a work day was worth one yuan." With this kind of mood, they became deaf to advice and blind to reality, advanced experiences were not widely promoted, cultivation technology was not greatly reformed, and agricultural production fell into a state of "stable but not advancing." For a long time, the average yield per unit area of rapeseed, wheat, and rice remained at the level of 100, 200, and 400 jin, respectively.
    "Stop" or "Revolutionize"? The wishes of the vast majority of people are naturally to "Revolutionize". In the past two years, they have indeed "Revolutionized" out great achievements. How did they break the mood of being content with the status quo and start the revolution? The person in charge of the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China said: "This has been a process of internal and external promotion and self-revolution."
    At important moments, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China repeatedly helped Wenjiang Prefecture clarify its direction and point out its goals. A few years ago, the Sichuan Provincial Committee established a group of experimental fields in Wenjiang Prefecture's front yard—Jinniu Dam—field by field, soil by soil. The yield of these experimental fields exceeded year after year. By 1963, the average yield per mu of rapeseed, wheat, and rice had reached 300 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively. This caused a strong reaction in people's minds. Cadres and commune members flocked here to visit, and a sharp question was placed before everyone: Could Wenjiang Prefecture be turned into a large Jinniu Dam?
    Then, news of large-scale high yields came one after another from Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu, the Pearl River Delta, and the suburbs of Shanghai. The suburbs of Shanghai were competitors with this place in 1960, and were also high-yield areas with similar natural conditions. In the past, the yields of various crops were sometimes higher and sometimes lower, but they quickly moved ahead. In this way, the claim that high-yield areas could not increase production on a large scale and by a large margin was no longer tenable. More people began to feel uneasy.
    In 1963, the heroic deeds of the Dazhai Brigade, which relied on its own hands to overcome poor mountains and harsh waters, shook the country and also shook the Chengdu Plain. Luo Shifa, a famous labor model and secretary of the Xinmin Commune Party Committee in Xindu County, heard the speech of Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, at the National People's Congress, and was so excited that he could not sleep that night. He thought: Dazhai has made such great achievements in such difficult conditions, relying on self-reliance, why can't I do it? He read Chen Yonggui's speech three times and immediately sent it back to the commune, suggesting that the commune Party Committee organize all cadres and commune members to discuss it and immediately launch a movement to learn from Dazhai. Later, someone asked him: "Dazhai moves stones, what do we move if we don't have stones to move?" Luo Shifa said: "We must first move the stones in our minds and overcome the idea of being content with the status quo."
    Zhang Qingshan, another famous labor model on the plains, after visiting Dazhai, went everywhere to tell people: "Dazhai has made such great contributions and still feels it is not enough. We cannot let good conditions blind us, and only see that our lives have improved and think it is almost enough. We must be like the Dazhai commune members, always thinking about the future, and never just see this year and next year, but see decades and hundreds of years." Zhang Qingshan alone gave more than 100,000 people reports introducing Dazhai.
    However, the decisive factor in the revolution in this prefecture came from within.
    The Socialist Education Movement further armed cadres and commune members with Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants raised their class consciousness and enhanced their revolutionary sense of responsibility, and wanted to farm for the revolution. They said: Our ancestors were able to build Dujiangyan and dared to wrestle with the heavens; we have the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the people's commune as our backing, how can we not make a big change in production? Wenjiang, Pixian, Xindu, Guanxian and other counties that launched the Socialist Education Movement the earliest, before the movement was even over, many communes and teams asked their superiors to strengthen leadership, make overall plans for the water system, supply improved varieties, and impart advanced experience... Some poor and lower-middle peasants even ran to the county people's committee to "complain", criticizing grassroots cadres for not actively leading them to carry out production reforms.
      Firmly Stand in Front of the Masses and Lead the Revolution
    The actions of the masses required leaders at all levels to show their attitude: would they hesitate behind them? Or would they actively lead them in front?
    The Wenjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously organized leading cadres at all levels to study and discuss Chairman Mao's instructions on opposing arrogance and complacency and standing still, reread works such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?", and required cadres at all levels to go into practice, go into the masses, and firmly stand in front of the masses to lead the movement. Leading comrades of the Prefectural Committee took the lead, leading cadres at all levels to plant experimental fields and demonstration fields, and went deep into the grassroots to conduct investigations and research, so that many comrades eliminated ideological obstacles in their progress through practice.
    Du Wenguang, the county magistrate of Wenjiang County, was a cadre from a local peasant background. He was relatively familiar with traditional production techniques, and was good at transplanting seedlings, harvesting grain, using plows, and trampling rakes. Over the years, he had paid more attention to participating in labor and had a relatively thorough work style, and was deeply loved by the masses. However, in his mind, he always believed that in western Sichuan, a mu yield of 500 to 600 jin of rice was already the limit, and it would be good to maintain this level every year. Therefore, some people called him "Old 500-600 Jin."
    In the spring of 1964, Du Wenguang came to the fifth production team of the Wanchun Brigade in Qingping Commune to work and stay there. Many poor and lower-middle peasants told him their thoughts on production, which greatly surprised him. Some old activists from the land reform ran over and said: "In the past, we farmed for the landlords, and whether the harvest was big or small, it was all his, and no one had the heart to increase production; now we are farming for the revolution, how can we in 'Golden Wenjiang' only get this 500-600 jin of grain per mu from such good land?" Some poor and lower-middle peasants said: Now, although we have enough grain to eat and more, we still lack money to spend. What should we do if we don't continue to increase production and develop the collective economy? Do you support us in taking this path?
    The opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants opened Du Wenguang's mind. He thought: The Party has handed over such a rich place to us. In the "Land of Abundance" in the socialist era, can production only stagnate at the "old level"?
    He made up his mind to "take a chance." He conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works with the commune members, participated in labor together, and planted experimental fields. In the past, he had never planted improved varieties of dwarf rice. In order to gain experience, in 1964 he and the masses jointly planted 13 mu, and the average yield reached more than 800 jin per mu. Revolutionary practice made Du Wenguang see the potential for increased production and see how great a force would be formed once Chairman Mao's thought armed the masses. A cadre who was famous for being "stable" and blindly believed in old technology and old yields thus became a revolutionary pioneer, striving for the upper reaches in leading agricultural production.
    People like Du Wenguang are very representative in Wenjiang Prefecture.
        Re-understanding "The Land of Abundance"
    Practice and struggle have made people's understanding of "The Land of Abundance" leap forward. Many comrades said: In the past, we were long prisoners of "The Land of Abundance," and now we are only beginning to be the masters of "The Land of Abundance."
    The production "layout" on the Chengdu Plain has been relatively advanced in history. The emergence of Dujiangyan made it possible for large areas of farmland to overcome the water conservancy barrier earlier, and coupled with the relatively dense population here, people had to find ways to tap the potential of the land. For a long time, a set of dry and water rotation systems was formed, and the crops and varieties before and after the stubble were also combined relatively closely. In the past, some people tried to make various changes, but because they did not have a clear understanding of the laws or did not have the power to create the material conditions for reform, they did not succeed. In this way, many people developed a blindness to maintaining the old methods and became prisoners of the habitual forces of the small peasant economy.
    To make revolution in production, one must lead and personally do experiments, explore the laws from them, and give full play to the role of people in accordance with the laws of the development of objective things, in order to revolutionize results, produce true knowledge, and liberate oneself from a state of blindness.
    Take variety reform as an example.
    In the past, some people did not have enough "reform" energy, and did not dare to reform much, fearing that something would go wrong, so that many improved varieties could not be promoted for several years. Later, many leading cadres, holding the spirit of not being afraid of "stirring up a hornet's nest," faced difficulties and dared to practice. The Pixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party Committees of various communes planted more than 100 mu of experimental fields of improved varieties of dwarf rice. They not only tried to win high yields, but also carefully observed how much "trouble" would be brought about by the promotion of improved varieties of dwarf rice, and saw clearly how many work days and how much fertilizer would need to be increased after the adoption of improved varieties? When is it needed? How to solve it? What improvements should be made in management accordingly? and so on. They analyzed one by one and solved the new contradictions brought about by the adoption of improved varieties, and finally found a better solution. In this way, with the improvement and renewal of seeds, it also promoted the improvement of cultivation technology, strengthened labor management, and correspondingly developed pig and cattle raising and green manure crops, winning relatively significant yield increases.
    The people of Wenjiang Prefecture thus broadened their horizons, liberated their minds, and carried out some major production reforms in practice. People walked out of a narrow small world, saw the great potential of "The Land of Abundance," and saw the great role of people.
        Persisting in Experiment and Demonstration Can Be Fast and Steady
    In carrying out production reforms, Wenjiang Prefecture has always paid attention to doing arduous and meticulous ideological and organizational work. They insist on adopting the methods of experiment and demonstration for each production reform. When leading cadres have no idea in their minds, they obtain first-hand information and realize a leap in leadership thinking by planting experimental fields and participating in labor. They strictly pay attention to preventing the imposition of the ideological understanding of leading cadres on the masses. Whenever the leadership has clarified the direction and found a way, they especially emphasize the publicity and demonstration work to the masses, patiently enlighten and wait for the masses to become aware. In this way, various advanced production measures can be promoted relatively quickly and steadily.
    The Wenjiang Prefectural Committee repeatedly reminded cadres at all levels to pay attention to laying a solid foundation on fundamental yield-increasing measures, adding steel to the edge, and carrying out the most effective labor. For example, one-third of the cultivated land here has a lower yield than ordinary farmland by one-third to one-half due to high groundwater levels, excessively compacted soil, etc., which is the main obstacle to achieving stable and high yields throughout the prefecture. How to transform these low-yield fields? In the spring of 1964, the Prefectural Committee Secretary and other leading comrades first went to a low-yield team in Xinmin Commune, Xindu County, to conduct a soil improvement pilot project, took the lead in carrying sand and topsoil, and publicized the significance of soil improvement to the masses. At the beginning, they only mobilized a dozen people to improve the soil with him, and some commune members just watched, always feeling that "dead" mud could not be turned "alive." Kang Maosheng, a commune member, initially thought that the Prefectural Committee Secretary came down to improve the soil, just to make a show and leave, and could not come up with anything famous. But after watching for a while, the Prefectural Committee Secretary did not leave, but instead became more and more enthusiastic. Seeing that the fields were leveled, he grabbed a handful of mud and squeezed it, and it was soft and crumbly in his hand. He thought it was really effective. If the Prefectural Committee Secretary could do this, why don't we follow him? This year, the low-yield fields they transformed increased by an average of more than 60%.
    In fact, Kang Maosheng was not the only one paying attention to the actions of the leading comrades of the Prefectural Committee. Cadres at all levels were watching them. Because they "brought down ideas," "brought down work styles," and "brought down revolutionary spirit." One by one, batch after batch, followed them to learn. Leaders at all levels went to the front line of soil improvement, personally digging ditches and carrying soil, personally touching the minds of the masses, personally persuading and mobilizing the masses, and personally checking the implementation of relevant policies. As a result, the vast number of grassroots cadres moved into action. The commune members in various places moved into action. In the winter of 1964 and the spring of 1965, the entire prefecture mobilized 380,000 people to transform 410,000 mu of low-yield fields to varying degrees. Before the sowing of the small spring in 1965, the entire prefecture transformed another 60,000 mu. At present, the speed and effectiveness of the soil improvement movement are far greater and faster than in previous years.
        Spurring, Encouragement, Motivation
    After the National Dazhai-style Agricultural Typical Exhibition exhibited the high-yield achievements of the large-scale demonstration fields in this prefecture, it caused a great shock in the minds of local leaders and the masses, who believed that they had received the greatest spur in front of the people of the whole country, and were determined to turn the spur and encouragement into a driving force for progress.
    "How much Dazhai spirit do we have?" People from top to bottom were introspecting and summarizing, checking, and arranging work based on this spirit.
    The Prefectural Committee Secretary and members said that we are far behind Dazhai. We have many conditions that the Dazhai Brigade does not have. If we fully learn the Dazhai spirit, we will make more and greater contributions to the people and the revolution. And for the whole prefecture to learn the Dazhai spirit, the most important thing is that the Prefectural Committee must take the lead in learning, and leaders at all levels must take the lead in taking the revolutionary path.
    Now, the people of the entire prefecture are in higher spirits, chasing each other, and want to build the western Sichuan Plain into a socialist "New Land of Abundance."

### 用革命精神种田——记“天府之国”四川温江专区闹革命

专栏：学大寨精神  走大寨道路  建设社会主义新农村

    用革命精神种田
    ——记“天府之国”四川温江专区闹革命
    编者按：四川盛产粮食，对国家贡献很大；温江专区历年提供的商品粮，又在全省数第一。温江人民对于我们国家的贡献，是值得人们称赞的。
    最近两年来，温江人民在社会主义教育运动中，在大寨精神鼓舞下，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，发扬了革命精神，自觉地扫除满足于现状的精神状态，决心为革命作出更大的贡献。他们说得好：“大寨作出了那么大的贡献还嫌不够，我们不能叫好条件遮住眼睛。”他们说得好：“为了革命，我们这样富庶的地方，更应当加倍努力，勇于挑重担子。”他们说得好：“种田为革命，我们‘金温江’这样好的田地，那能一亩只拿五、六百斤谷子。”为革命种田的思想树立起来，用革命精神去种田，那种“稳而不进”的生产局面就被突破，生产大大地前进了一步。
    温江专区的经验再一次告诉我们，在我国，无论是自然条件好的或者自然条件不好的地区，无论是高产的或者低产的地区，都是大有潜力，大有可为。为了把这种增产潜力挖掘出来，最根本的，就是用毛泽东思想去提高人们的革命自觉。人们有了高度的革命自觉，就能最大限度地调动积极性，坚持不懈地同自然界进行斗争，争取低产变高产，高产更高产，永不停止，永远向前。
    在毛泽东思想指导下，山穷水恶的地方在闹革命，富饶的平原也在闹革命。
    四川省富饶的温江专区近年来勇往直前地走在闹革命的道路上，并且做出了显著的成绩。
    富饶的高产区能不能更高产？温江专区的事实是，他们能够突破产量“稳而不进”的局面，阔步向前。这里的各项作物在一九六四年已经达到和接近历史最高水平；一九六五年，水稻、油菜、小麦又分别增产了一成、两成三、两成七。五十万亩小麦样板田，在原有基础上增产了四成，比一九六四年全区平均亩产高出七成。
    高产区要再高产，一定需要国家大量投资，供应充足的化肥吗？温江专区的事实是：他们并没要国家增加多少投资，也没有依赖化肥供应，而是依靠集体力量，自力更生发展生产。一九六四年每亩耕地平均由国家供应的化肥不到八斤，一九六五年更少。他们主要是靠着增种绿肥、发展养猪、积造自然肥料和社队自己投资兴建小型化肥厂，来解决缺肥的问题。现在全区平均每一个半农业人口就有一头猪。这两年，温江专区改造四十多万亩低产的死黄泥、白膳泥、粗砂土和下湿田，也基本上没要国家投资。
    人多地少的平坝区，缺少放牧地和宜林地，也不是不能繁殖耕牛和大量植树造林的。温江专区在最近三年内，破天荒地自己繁殖四万头耕牛；两年内全区植树造林十二万多亩，零散植树两亿多株，河边、路边、田边，出现了成片成行的树木。
    温江专区人民对支援国家社会主义建设，从不后人。历年提供的商品粮油，在全省都是最高的。
      “没有全国利益就谈不到本地利益，没有整体的富就谈不到局部的富，为了革命，我们这样富庶的地方，更应当加倍努力，勇于挑重担子。”这就是温江专区人民闹革命的动力。“停”下来，还是“革”下去
    温江专区，在祖国多山的西南地区是一块难得的大平原。这里气候温和，四季常青；土地肥沃，物产丰富。古书上记载的“天府之国”，就是指的这个地方。
    解放以后，这里进行了土地改革、农业合作化、公社化运动，充分发挥了人民的革命积极性，使人民的“天府”，一年年建设得更加富饶。古老的都江堰，解放前经历了二千二百多年，它的灌溉面积最多时不过三百万亩，而现在扩大到六百多万亩，各项农作物产量都有所增长。
    但是，温江专区生产发展到一定阶段以后，有一部分人就产生安于现状的自满情绪，踏步不前。他们曾有五个满足：满足于各项工作“过得去”，满足于年年完成国家“任务”，满足于“生产超过了过去的富裕农民”，满足于“每人分口粮五百斤”，满足于
  “一个劳动日值一元钱”。有了这种情绪，就耳听不聪，眼看不明，先进经验推而不广，耕作技术改革不大，农业生产陷入
  “稳而不进”的状态。在很长一段时间里，油菜、小麦和水稻的平均单位产量，分别停留在一百、二百、四百多斤的水平上。
    究竟“停”下来，还是“革”下去？广大人民的愿望自然是“革”下去。最近两年，果然“革”出很大的成绩来了。他们是怎样打破安于现状的情绪而闹起革命的呢？中共温江地委负责人说：“这是经历了一个内外促进，自我革命的斗争过程。”
    中共四川省委在重要时刻，一再帮助温江专区明确前进方向，指明奋斗目标。几年前，四川省委就在温江专区的大门口——金牛坝，田挨田，土挨土的建立了一批试验田。这些试验田的产量，一年超过一年。到一九六三年，油菜、小麦、水稻平均亩产已经分别达到三百斤、五百斤、八百斤。这在人们思想上引起了强烈的反应。干部和社员从四面八方涌到这里来参观，一个尖锐的问题摆在大家面前：能不能把温江专区变成大金牛坝？
    接着，由江苏苏州专区、珠江三角洲、上海市郊区连连传来了大面积高产的消息。上海郊区在一九六○年是跟这里挂钩竞赛的对手，同是自然条件相似的高产区，过去各项农作物互有高低，但是他们很快地走到了前面。这样一来，所谓高产区不能大面积大幅度增产的说法，再也站不住脚了。更多的人开始感到不安了。
    一九六三年，大寨大队依靠双手，战胜穷山恶水的英雄事迹震撼了全国，也震撼了川西平原。著名劳动模范、新都县新民公社党委书记罗世发，在全国人民代表大会上，听到大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵的发言，当天晚上激动得睡不着觉。他想：大寨在那样困难的条件下，依靠自力更生，做出这样大的成绩，自己为啥办不到呢？他把陈永贵的发言稿连读三遍，并马上寄回公社，建议公社党委组织全体干部、社员讨论，立即开展学大寨的运动。以后，有人问他：“大寨搬石头，我们没有石头搬什么？”罗世发说：“我们要先搬思想上的石头，克服满足不前的思想。”
    平原上的另一位著名劳动模范张青山，到大寨参观回来以后，到处向人宣传说：“大寨作出了那么大的贡献还嫌不够，我们不能叫好条件遮住眼睛，光看到自己生活改善了，就认为差不多了。我们要象大寨社员那样，心里随时想到将来，绝不能只看到今年、明年，而要看到几十年、几百年。”光是张青山就给十几万人作了介绍大寨的报告。
    不过，这个专区闹革命的决定性因素还是来自内部。
    社会主义教育运动，使干部和社员进一步用毛泽东思想武装了自己。广大贫下中农提高了阶级觉悟，增强了革命责任感，要为革命种田。他们说：我们的祖先能修都江堰，敢和老天扳手劲；我们有共产党毛主席的领导，有人民公社当靠山，还能不叫生产大变样？温江、郫县、新都、灌县等最早开展社会主义教育运动的县，运动还没有结束，许多社队就纷纷要求上级加强领导，统筹规划水系，供应良种，传授先进经验，……有些贫下中农还跑到县人民委员会“告状”，批评基层干部不积极领导他们进行生产改革。
      坚定地站在群众前面领导革命
    群众的行动要求各级领导表明态度，是站在他们后边徘徊？还是站在他们前面积极领导？
    中共温江地委认真组织各级领导干部学习讨论了毛主席关于反对骄傲自满，故步自封的指示，重读《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等著作，并要求各级干部到实际中去，到群众中去，坚定地站在群众前面领导运动。地委领导同志以身作则，带动各级干部大种试验田，样板田，深入蹲点调查研究，使许多同志通过实践，扫除了前进中的思想障碍。
    温江县县长杜文光是当地农民出身的干部，他对传统的生产技术比较熟悉，栽秧、打谷、使犁、踏耙都有一手。他多年来比较重视参加劳动，作风比较深入，深受群众爱戴。可是，在他的脑子里，过去总认为在川西，水稻亩产五六百斤已经算是到了头，年年能保住这个水平就不错了。因此有人管他叫“老五六百斤”。
    一九六四年春天，杜文光来到清平公社万春大队五生产队蹲点劳动。许多贫下中农对他讲出了自己对生产的想法，大大出乎他的意料。有些土地改革时的老积极分子跑来说：“过去我们给地主种田，收多收少都是他的，谁也没心肠提高产量；现在种田为革命，我们‘金温江’这样好的田土，那能一亩只拿这五六百斤谷子。”有的贫下中农说：现在，我们的粮食虽说够吃有余，可是还缺钱用，不继续提高产量，发展集体经济，怎么办？你到底支不支持我们走这条路？
    贫下中农的意见，使杜文光的脑筋开了窍。他想：党把这样富饶的地方交给了我们，在社会主义时代的“天府之国”，难道生产就只能停滞在“老水平”上？
    他下定决心要“闯闯看”。他认真地和社员一起学习毛主席著作，一道参加劳动，种试验田。过去，他从没种过矮秆水稻良种。为了取得经验，一九六四年他和群众一道试种了十三亩，结果亩产平均达到八百多斤。革命的实践，使杜文光看到了增产的潜力，看到毛主席的思想一旦武装了群众，会形成怎样巨大的力量。一个以“稳”出名，盲目相信老技术、老产量的干部，就这样变成了一名革命闯将，在领导农业生产上力争上游。
    象杜文光这样的人物，在温江专区是很有代表性的。
        重　新　认　识“天　府”
    实践，斗争，使人们对“天府”的认识产生了飞跃。许多同志说：以前我们长期做了“天府”的俘虏，现在才开始做“天府”的主人。
    成都平原的生产“铺排”在历史上是比较先进的。都江堰的出现，使大面积农田较早地过了水利关，再加上这里人口比较稠密，人们不能不设法挖掘土地潜力，长期以来形成了一套水旱轮作制度，前后茬的作物、品种组合得也比较严密。过去，也有人试图做种种改变，但由于对于规律认识不清，或者没有力量创造改革的物质条件，因而没有成功。这样，就使许多人产生了维持老办法的盲目性，做了小农经济习惯势力的俘虏。
    要在生产上闹革命，就得领导亲身去做试验，从中摸索规律，并按照客观事物的发展规律充分发挥人的作用，才能革出成果，产生真知，使自己从盲目状态中解放出来。
    就拿品种改革来说吧。
    以前，有些人“改”劲不足，不大敢改，怕出了乱子，使许多良种几年推广不开。后来，许多领导干部抱定不怕“捅马蜂窝”的精神，迎着困难，勇于实践。中共郫县县委和各公社党委，共种了一百多亩矮秆水稻良种的试验田。他们不光想办法夺取高产，而且仔细观察推广矮秆水稻良种后究竟会带来多少“麻烦”，看清采用良种以后，要增加多少劳动日和多少肥料？在什么时候需要？怎么解决？在经营管理上要相应地进行哪些改进？等等。他们逐个剖析和动手解决采用良种后带来的新矛盾，终于找到了较好的解决办法。这样，随着种子的改良更新，也促进了耕作技术的提高，加强了劳动管理，并相应地发展了养猪、养牛和种绿肥作物，赢得了比较显著的增产效果。
    温江专区的人们，就这样在实践中，开阔了视野，解放了思想，进行了一些重大的生产改革。人们走出了狭窄的小天地，看到了“天府之国”的巨大潜力，看到了人的伟大作用。
        坚持试验示范才能又快又稳
    温江专区在进行生产改革中，始终注意做艰苦细致的思想工作和组织工作。他们进行每项生产改革，都坚持采取试验、示范的方法。当领导干部心中无数时，就通过种试验田，参加劳动，取得第一手资料，实现领导思想上的飞跃。他们严格注意防止把领导干部的思想认识，强加于群众。每当领导上摸清了方向，找到了办法，便特别强调对群众的宣传和示范工作，耐心启发和等待群众觉悟。这样，就使各项先进生产措施能得到比较快又比较稳的推广。
    温江地委一再提醒各级干部，注意在带有根本性的增产措施上多下基本功，把钢加在刃上，进行最有效的劳动。比如这里有三分之一的耕地由于地下水位过高、泥土过于板结等原因，产量比一般田地要低三分之一到一半，是全区实现稳产高产的主要障碍。怎样改造这些低产田？一九六四年春天，地委书记和其他领导同志，首先到新都县新民公社一个低产队进行改土试点，带头挑沙面土，并向群众宣传改土的意义。一开始，他们只说动了十几个人，跟他一起改土，有些社员只是跟着看，总觉得“死”泥巴改不“活”。社员康茂生开始以为地委书记下来改土，只是做个样子就走了，搞不出啥子名堂。可是他看了一段时间，地委书记并没有走，反而越干越起劲。眼看着田块平整了，他抓起泥巴一捏，握在手里泡酥酥的，心想真有效果，地委书记都能这样干，我们为啥不跟上去。这一年，他们改造的一片低产田平均增产百分之六十以上。
    其实，何止康茂生一个人在注视地委领导同志的行动。各级干部都在看他们。因为他们“带下来思想”，“带下来作风”，“带下来革命精神”。一个个、一批批跟着他们学。各级领导纷纷上了改土前线，亲身挖沟担土，亲手摸群众思想，亲口说服动员群众，亲自检查有关政策的贯彻执行情况。于是，广大基层干部动起来了。各地社员动起来了。一九六四年冬天和一九六五年春天，全区出动了三十八万群众，对四十一万亩低产田进行了不同程度的改造。一九六五年小春播种前，全区又改了六万亩。目前，改土运动的进展速度和成效之快之大，又远非往年可比了。
        鞭策，鼓励，动力
    全国大寨式农业典型展览，展出了这个专区大面积样板田获得高产的事迹以后，在当地领导和群众思想上引起很大震动，认为在全国人民面前受到了最大的鞭策，决心把鞭策、鼓舞变成前进的动力。
    “我们究竟有多少大寨精神？”上上下下都在反躬自问，并且根据这个精神总结、检查和安排工作。
    地委书记和委员们说，我们跟大寨比，相差很远。我们有大寨大队所没有的许多条件，如果完全把大寨精神学到手，就会对人民、对革命作出更多更大的贡献。而全区要想把大寨精神学到手，最主要的一条就是地委要带头学，各级领导要带头走革命化的道路。
    现在，全区人民意气更加风发，你追我赶，要把川西平原建设成社会主义的“新天府”。
