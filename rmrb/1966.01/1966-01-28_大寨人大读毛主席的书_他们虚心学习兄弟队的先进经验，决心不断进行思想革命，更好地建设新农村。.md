    The Party Branch of the Dazhai Brigade of the Dazhai Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, is further holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and humbly learning the revolutionary spirit and advanced experience of fraternal teams.
    In late December of last year, Chen Yonggui, Secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, and Guo Fenglian, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch, returned from visiting advanced agricultural production units in Beijing, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces as part of the Jinzhong Special District agricultural study tour. On the same day, they convened a meeting of the Party Branch Committee, and the next day they introduced the entire commune members to the visiting tour and the advanced deeds of various fraternal units.
    At the meeting, Chen Yonggui said: "I left with two questions: one is how to develop forestry, and the other is how to develop water conservancy. But the more I visited, the more I realized that the problems we need to solve are not just these two, but many more. We must humbly learn from all fraternal units."
    The commune members of Dazhai had a heated discussion about the advanced experiences of various fraternal teams, with thirty-six people speaking at the meeting. Song Liying, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch, said: "In the past, we felt that Dazhai's conditions were not good, and it was already remarkable that we could achieve what we have today. After hearing about the advanced deeds of other places, I feel that we are lagging behind." Jia Chengfu, of the Forestry Group, said: "In the past, we thought that we were highly motivated and had planted many trees on the mountains. Who knew that others were even more motivated, opening up rocks to plant trees and had already greened the mountains. In the past, we thought that young people had no experience in farming and could not do technical work. Now we understand that young people play a very important role in scientific experiments. We should quickly carry out ideological revolution." Cadres and commune members spoke one after another, identifying many gaps. The commune members said that dozens of gaps, hundreds of gaps, ultimately boil down to an ideological gap.
    In order to learn the advanced experiences of fraternal units well, the Dazhai people have paid special attention to studying Chairman Mao's works. Party branch members and commune members have together repeatedly studied articles such as "Serve the People," "The Important Problem Is 'Good at Learning'," and "Get Rid of the Baggage and Start the Machine" from December of last year until now.
    Currently, the winter production of the Dazhai Brigade is in full swing. They are striving to make the advanced experiences of fraternal units take root, blossom, and bear fruit in Dazhai in the new year.

    大寨人大读毛主席的书
    他们虚心学习兄弟队的先进经验，决心不断进行思想革命，更好地建设新农村。
    山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队党支部，进一步高举毛泽东思想红旗，虚心学习兄弟队的革命精神和先进经验。
    去年十二月下旬，大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵和团支部书记郭凤莲跟随晋中专区农业参观团，从北京、山东、河南、河北等地的农业生产先进单位参观回来，当天就召开了党支部委员会，第二天又给全体社员介绍了参观访问的经过和各兄弟单位的先进事迹。
    会上，陈永贵说：“我走时带着两个问题：一是如何发展林业，二是如何发展水利。可是越参观越发现我们需要解决的问题不是这两个，而是很多。我们一定要虚心向一切兄弟单位学习。”
    大寨的社员们对各兄弟队的先进经验进行了热烈讨论，有三十六个人在会上发了言。党支部副书记宋立英说：“过去觉得大寨条件不好，能够搞成现在这个样子就不错了。听了其他地方的先进事迹，感到咱们落后了。”林业组贾承富说：“过去认为咱们干劲大，在山上种了不少树，谁知道人家的干劲更大，打开石头种树，已经把山都绿化了。过去认为青年人没有种地经验，干不了技术活，现在可明白了，青年搞科学实验的作用大得很。咱们应赶快进行思想革命。”干部和社员你一言，我一语，找出了许多差距。社员们说，几十个差距，几百个差距，归根到底是一个思想差距。
    为了学好兄弟单位的先进经验，大寨人特别抓紧了大学毛主席著作。党支部委员和社员们一起，从去年十二月到现在，反复学习了《为人民服务》、《重要的问题在善于学习》、《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章。
    目前，大寨大队的冬季生产热气腾腾，他们力争在新的一年里，使兄弟单位的先进经验在大寨落地生根，开花结果。
