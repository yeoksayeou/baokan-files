    Mao Zedong Thought is Invincible
    Our Athletes Universally Improve Performance with Politics Leading Technology
    (Xinhua News Agency, January 1st) In 1965, our athletes diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, used Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves, "kept the motherland in their hearts, and the world in their sights," practiced hard to master superb skills, and achieved one victory after another on the journey to climb the peaks of world sports technology.
    This year, our table tennis team won five of the seven championships at the 28th World Table Tennis Championships, and achieved complete victories at the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational Tournament and the Scandinavian International Table Tennis Championships. The badminton team, in contests with the world runner-up Danish men's team and the world's third-ranked Danish women's team, as well as the Swedish men's and women's teams, achieved an outstanding record of winning every one of the thirty-four matches played.
    Athletes in track and field, swimming, weightlifting, speed skating, motorcycle racing, cycling, archery, equestrian obstacle jumping, shooting, radio transmission and reception, parachute jumping, gliding, model aircraft, and model boats, created a total of 205 new national records last year, including 43 world records broken 67 times by 67 athletes, making 1965 the year with the most new national and world records created since the founding of New China. In other sports such as ball games, chess, and gymnastics, the technical level of our athletes has also made new progress.
    Responsible persons from relevant departments believe that the series of significant achievements made by our athletes are the result of the continuous improvement of the athletes' political and ideological consciousness, with politics leading technology. The most prominent examples of this are our men's and women's table tennis teams. Their advanced deeds of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and of excelling in both ideology and technique, have become models for other sports teams to learn from. Our women's table tennis team's first victory in winning the women's team world championship at the World Championships provided great encouragement and powerful inspiration. It tells athletes: as long as they arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, establish lofty aspirations, and work diligently in peacetime, and during competitions, display the revolutionary spirit of daring to win and being good at struggle, there is no height that cannot be reached, and no fortress that cannot be conquered.
    Because the broad masses of athletes have gradually established the thinking of "playing ball for the revolution" and "exercising for the revolution", tremendous material strength has been generated. Proceeding from the needs of actual combat, they carried out high-intensity training rigorously and demanding, promoted the spirit of not fearing hardship, fatigue, or difficulty, learned from each other, helped each other, and bravely broke with the old and established the new, taking their own path, and creating many excellent results.
    This year, male and female track and field athletes broke 33 national records (all 15 national records for women were broken 14 times), 14 of which reached advanced world levels. In order to rapidly improve the technical level of track and field in our country, many athletes continued to promote the revolutionary spirit after the Second National Games, and their performance improved by leaps and bounds. Sichuan athlete Chen Jiaquan's men's 100-meter race time improved from 10.2 seconds to 10.1 seconds, and then tied the world record with an excellent result of 10 seconds. Fujian athlete Ni Zhiqin successively jumped over heights of 2.23 meters, 2.24 meters, and 2.25 meters, creating the world's best performance in the men's high jump last year. Beijing athlete Cui Lin's men's 110-meter hurdles race time also improved from 13.8 seconds to 13.6 seconds, and finally created the world's best performance of 13.5 seconds last year.
    Male and female swimmers broke the "conventional" practice of only conducting land training and not going into the water for training and competitions in winter, and refreshed a batch of national records as early as New Year's Day last year. By the time the Second National Games ended in September, a total of 74 people in the country had refreshed 27 national records 405 times, accounting for 90 percent of all 30 national swimming records.
    Weightlifters worked hard at their basic skills, and finally broke the world record for the press in two weight classes for the first time last year, and also broke the world record for the snatch and clean and jerk each once. Guangdong's lightest weight class athlete Chen Manlin's press result improved from the original 113 kg to 118 kg, breaking the world record of 117.5 kg. Liaoning's middleweight athlete Liu Dianwu's press result improved by as much as 12.5 kg in just over seven months, from 136.5 kg to 149 kg, breaking the world record of 148.5 kg.
    Because radio transmission and reception athletes broke the only international highest score for women's hand-keyed code transmission held by foreign athletes, all 16 international highest scores for long code and code of male and female radio transmission and reception are now held by our athletes. This year, shooting athletes broke all four world records for men's running deer shooting and one world record for large-caliber rifle shooting. The world records broken this year also include nine in parachute jumping, six in archery, and five in model aircraft.
    This year, some young newcomers in our country also advanced despite difficulties, catching up with and even surpassing the world level. Sun Chunlan, a seventeen-year-old from Shanghai who had been participating in archery for less than a year, broke two world records in the women's 60-meter double round and 70-meter double round in June 1965. In the same month, the Shandong Parachute Team, which broke the world record for the women's daytime 1,000-meter six-person collective spot landing, also included Qiao Jin, a participant who was only sixteen years old.
    The rapid progress of rising stars has created a prosperous scene in various sports.

    毛泽东思想战无不胜
    我国运动员以政治带技术成绩普遍提高
    据新华社一日讯　一九六五年，我国运动员努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，“心怀祖国，放眼世界”，苦练过硬本领，在攀登世界运动技术高峰的征途中，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    这一年，我国乒乓球队在第二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛中，夺得了七个项目当中的五项冠军，并且在北京国际乒乓球邀请赛和斯堪的纳维亚国际乒乓球锦标赛中，获得了全胜；羽毛球队在同世界亚军丹麦男子队和世界第三名丹麦女子队，以及瑞典男、女队交锋时，取得了三十四盘比赛盘盘获胜的优异战绩。
    田径、游泳、举重、速度滑冰、赛车场自行车、射箭、乘马超越障碍、射击、无线电收发报、飞机跳伞、滑翔、航空模型、航海模型等项目的运动员，去年共创造了二百零五项全国新纪录，其中包括六十七名选手四十三次刷新了二十九项世界纪录，从而使一九六五年成为新中国成立以来创造全国新纪录和世界新纪录最多的一年。在其他球类、棋类、体操等项目中，我国运动员的技术水平也有了新的进展。
    有关部门负责人认为，我国运动员能够取得这一系列的重大成就，是运动员们政治思想觉悟不断提高，以政治带动技术的结果。这方面表现最突出的，是我国男女乒乓球队。他们活学活用毛主席著作，思想技术双过硬的先进事迹，已经成为其他项目运动队学习的榜样。我国女子乒乓球队在世界锦标赛上第一次赢得女子团体世界冠军，给了人们极大的鼓舞和有力的启示。它告诉运动员们：只要用毛泽东思想武装自己，树雄心，立大志，平时勤学苦练，比赛中发扬敢于胜利、善于斗争的革命精神，就无高不可攀、无坚不可摧。
    由于广大运动员逐步树立起“为革命而打球”、“为革命而锻炼”的思想，因而产生了巨大的物质力量。他们从实战需要出发，从难、从严进行大运动量训练，发扬不怕苦、不怕累、不怕难的精神，相互学习，彼此帮助，勇于破旧立新，走自己的道路，创造了许多优良的成绩。
    男女田径运动员这一年刷新了三十三项全国纪录（女子的全部十五项全国纪录刷新了十四项），其中有十四项达到了世界先进水平。为了迅速提高我国田径运动的技术水平，许多选手在第二届全运会后，继续发扬革命精神，成绩一跃再跃。四川选手陈家全男子百米赛跑成绩由十秒二提高到十秒一，紧接着又以十秒的优异成绩平了世界纪录。福建选手倪志钦先后跳过了二米二三、二米二四、二米二五的高度，接连创造了去年男子跳高的世界最好成绩。北京选手崔麟的男子一百一十米高栏赛跑成绩，也由十三秒八提高到十三秒六，最后创造了去年的世界最好成绩——十三秒五。
    男女游泳运动员们突破了冬季只进行陆上训练而不下水训练和比赛的“常规”，在去年元旦就刷新了一批全国纪录。到九月间第二届全运会结束时，全国共有七十四人四百零五次刷新了二十七项全国纪录，占全部三十项游泳全国纪录的百分之九十。
    举重运动员猛练硬功夫，终于在去年第一次刷新了两个级别推举的世界纪录，另外还刷新了抓举和挺举世界纪录各一项。广东最轻量级选手陈满林的推举成绩，由原来的一一三公斤提高到一一八公斤，刷新了一一七点五公斤的世界纪录。辽宁中量级选手刘殿武的推举成绩，在短短的七个多月内就提高了十二点五公斤之多，由一三六点五公斤提高到一四九公斤，刷新了一四八点五公斤的世界纪录。
    无线电收发报选手由于刷新了唯一由外国选手保持的女子手键字码发报的国际最高成绩，从而使男女无线电收发报长码和字码全部十六项国际最高成绩都由我国选手所保持。射击选手这一年刷新了全部四项男子跑鹿射击的世界纪录和一项大口径步枪射击的世界纪录。这一年刷新的世界纪录还有飞机跳伞九项、射箭六项、航空模型五项。
    这一年中，我国一些年轻的新手也知难而进，迎头赶上甚至超过世界水平。参加射箭运动还不到一年的上海十七岁的孙春兰，在一九六五年六月间就刷新了女子六十米双轮和七十米双轮两项世界纪录。同一个月，在刷新女子日间一千米六人集体定点跳伞世界纪录的山东跳伞队中，也包括了一位年仅十六岁的选手乔金。
    后起之秀的迅速进步，使各项运动中都出现了欣欣向荣的景象。
