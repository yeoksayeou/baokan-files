    Hanoi Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians in Central Trung Bo, South Vietnam, launched thousands of attacks against the enemy last year, annihilating a total of 70,000 enemy troops, including more than 10,000 U.S. aggressor troops. The military and civilians in the entire region completely wiped out twenty entire battalions of U.S.-puppet troops and shot down or destroyed hundreds of enemy aircraft of various types.
    In 1965, although the United States deployed two-thirds of its U.S. troops invading Vietnam into this region, including the First Cavalry Division (Airmobile), known as the "most elite" and "most battle-hardened," the military and civilians of Central Trung Bo were not intimidated. On the contrary, they further developed their heroic and unyielding tradition of daring to fight and daring to win, and continuously inflicted heavier and heavier blows on the U.S.-puppet troops, regardless of the rainy or dry season, plunging the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys deeper into the vast ocean of people's war. After the U.S. Airmobile Division intruded into Central Trung Bo, it not only failed to "maneuver" but was instead battered and exhausted by the military and civilians of Central Trung Bo, writing a new defeat in the history of U.S. aggression. The great victories at Nhung Ridge, Qingshan, Ba Gia, Van Tuong, Chu Lai, Da Nang, Plei Me, and the recent Dong Duong demonstrate that the Central Trung Bo Liberation Armed Forces have sufficient strength to fight and eliminate U.S.-puppet troops in any terrain.
    The political struggle movement of the people in Central Trung Bo is also flourishing, powerfully coordinating with the armed struggle. In the first ten months of last year alone, the people in various places launched 3,600 political struggles, with the number of participants reaching 1.9 million.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: Saigon News: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces launched a surprise attack on U.S.-puppet troops conducting a "sweep" in the "Iron Triangle" area northwest of Saigon on the morning of the 13th, inflicting "considerable" casualties on one battalion of puppet troops, and the American "advisors" with this battalion suffered "heavy casualties."
    According to Western news agencies, just as dawn broke on the morning of the 13th, the First Battalion of the 49th Regiment of puppet troops was clearing the road for the U.S. aggressor troops conducting a "sweep" more than 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon when the Liberation Armed Forces unexpectedly launched a surprise attack on them, hitting the enemy hard and leaving them unable to resist at all. U.S. aircraft hurriedly scrambled to provide support, but the Liberation Armed Forces brought their characteristics of rapid combat into full play, resolving the battle in just one and a half hours. By the time these aircraft arrived, it was already "too late."
    The report said that the attack took place only a few kilometers away from the command post of the U.S. aggressor troops' "sweep."
    Hanoi Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Soc Trang Province, South Vietnam, annihilated three enemy companies, including four U.S. aggressors, in a battle to smash the enemy's "sweep" on January 5th.
    On that day, two companies of puppet troops and one company of security forces, under the command of U.S. aggressors, carried out a "sweep" of Qiangjian Township in Jia Lai County, attempting to plunder the people of this township of their grain and property. The Liberation Armed Forces heroically surrounded the invading enemy, and after a short period of combat, completely annihilated the enemy and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

    南越解放军满怀仇恨严惩野蛮强盗
    在“铁三角”地带发动奇袭使美伪军伤亡惨重
    在中部中区去年歼灭一万多名美国侵略军
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方中部中区军民去年一年中连续对敌人发起数千次进攻，共歼敌七万名，其中有一万多名美国侵略军。全区军民全歼美伪军二十个整营，击落和击毁敌人的各种飞机成百架。
    一九六五年，尽管美国把侵越美军的三分之二开进这个地区，其中包括号称“最精锐”、“最善战”的第一骑兵师（空中机动师），但是中部中区军民并没有被吓倒，相反，他们更加发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英勇不屈传统，不分雨季和旱季，连续给予美伪军以一次比一次沉重的打击，使美国侵略者及其走狗更深地陷入人民战争的汪洋大海中。美国的空中机动师闯进中部中区以后，不但无法“机动”，反而被中部中区军民打得焦头烂额，在美国侵略战争史上写下了新的败绩。戎岭、青山、巴嘉、文相、朱莱、岘港、波来梅和最近的同阳大捷表明，中部中区解放武装力量有足够的力量，在任何地形进行战斗和消灭美伪军。
    中部中区人民的政治斗争运动也蓬勃发展，有力地配合着武装斗争。仅去年头十个月，各地人民就开展了三千六百次政治斗争，参加的人数达一百九十万人次。
    新华社十三日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十三日晨在西贡西北“铁三角”地带奇袭正在那里进行“扫荡”的美伪军，使一营伪军遭到“相当程度”的伤亡，和这营伪军一起的美国“顾问”“伤亡惨重”。
    据西方通讯社报道，十三日早晨天刚黎明，伪军第四十九团第一营正在西贡西北三十多公里的地方为进行“扫荡”的美国侵略军在公路上开路，解放武装力量出其不意地向他们发动突然袭击，打得敌军蒙头转向，丝毫不能抵挡。美国飞机急忙出动支援，但解放武装力量发挥快速战斗的特长，只用一个半小时就解决了战斗，等这些飞机飞来，已经“为时过晚”。
    报道说，袭击发生在离美国侵略军这次“扫荡”的指挥部只有几公里的地方。
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方朔庄省解放武装力量一月五日在粉碎敌人“扫荡”的战斗中，歼灭敌人三个连，其中包括美国侵略者四名。
    当天，伪军两个连和保安队一个连在美国侵略者的指挥下，向稼来县羌健乡进行“扫荡”，企图抢夺这个乡人民的谷子和财物。解放武装力量英勇地包围了来犯敌人，经过很短时间的战斗，全部歼灭了敌人，并且缴获了大批武器和军用物资。
