    “Spring is coming, I will bring my 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung', carry a new hoe, and go to the forefront of production.” Our revolutionary successors, the newly appointed county party secretaries and deputy secretaries, greet the spring of 1966 with such determination.

    Today, our newspaper has selected articles by Comrades Zhou Mingshan, Guo Jianjie, Dong Zhiwen, Liu Guanshui, Liu Yunrui, and Su Haicheng. These articles sparkle with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought between the lines. We are very pleased to see that in today's great development of our country's socialist revolution and construction, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, proletarian revolutionary successors are growing up batch after batch. They are highly conscious, energetic, and confidently taking up new positions. This is a sign of our country's prosperity.

    Forever study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, forever maintain close ties with the masses, forever carry the hoe, and forever fight on the front lines. Our revolutionary successors must firmly remember and do these things, and our revolutionary cause will become more and more prosperous.

    Succession means first and foremost inheriting the mantle of Mao Zedong Thought, that is, arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end. Zhou Mingshan, the party branch secretary of the Nanliu Brigade of Nanfan Commune in Jiang County, Shanxi Province, was recently promoted to the position of Secretary of the Jiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhou Mingshan's growth process is a process of learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Persisting in the unremitting study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, learning and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's most firm and thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit and most flexible and ingenious struggle art, has enabled him to stand firm in the class struggle amidst great storms and waves, and to lead the masses to overcome one difficulty after another in the arduous and complex production struggle. Today, as he begins to assume the duties of county party secretary, he consciously regards further studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way as a prerequisite for doing a good job in his new work.

    Why do Comrades Zhou Mingshan and others have such deep feelings for Comrade Mao Zedong's works? This is because they have emerged from the struggles of the masses. They act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, and with each step forward, their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought deepens, and their feelings for Comrade Mao Zedong's works deepen. They have learned from their own experience that Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most vivid ideological force, and it is the magic weapon for guiding the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. For a revolutionary successor, if he wants to mature politically more quickly and be able to shoulder the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him by the Party and the people, he must diligently and continuously study Chairman Mao's works, and place this important matter in the primary position of all work. As long as one is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, one will naturally be able to maintain close ties with the masses forever, never put down the hoe, and never leave the front lines.

    With the deepening of the socialist revolution and the development of the construction cause, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate new forces and promote outstanding young talents with both ability and integrity to leadership positions. This is the need of the revolutionary cause and the inevitable law of the development of objective things. This is a matter of paramount importance related to the future of the proletarian revolution, and we must seriously and enthusiastically do this important thing well.

    The starting point for all our considerations can only be the interests of the Party and the people's cause, and not anything else. From this point of view, we must adhere to the principle of both ability and integrity, both red and expert, in cadre issues. With integrity, one can wholeheartedly serve the people; with ability, one can serve the people effectively. A cadre's integrity and ability are related to his struggle experience, but are mainly determined by the study and application of Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Judging from integrity and ability, whoever can shoulder heavier responsibilities should be asked to shoulder heavier responsibilities. People with individualistic thoughts are afraid that students will surpass their teachers. In fact, it is a good thing for students to surpass their teachers and for new cadres to surpass old cadres, and we should be happy about it. It is always a teacher for students, as they see that the teachers continue to go all out to work and help students surpass themselves, and the students recognize the revolutionary breadth of mind and noble sentiments that this action displays. Today, in various regions and on various fronts, many revolutionary veterans are enthusiastically helping and strictly demanding of newly selected cadres, so that they can fully play their role in various leadership positions. This is a manifestation of a high degree of responsibility to the Party and the people's revolutionary cause, and it deserves praise.

    Revolutionaries always mature gradually by developing their achievements and correcting their mistakes. Comrades who are promoted to leadership positions will inevitably encounter difficulties in their work, and it is inevitable that some problems will arise. However, there is nothing to be afraid of. Things cultivated in greenhouses will not have strong vitality. Therefore, we must let them go to the storm of struggle to break through and train. Only in this way can red revolutionary successors be cultivated. Newly promoted comrades should realize that the Party promotes itself to a leadership position, which is the need of the revolution, and it is by no means to let oneself be an official and act like a master. Therefore, we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, humbly learn from the old comrades, learn from the masses, and insist on participating in collective productive labor, and never be separated from the masses of the people.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and are in a prosperous period, like the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Hope is placed on you." This is the highest trust in the revolutionary successors, and it is also the most powerful encouragement and spur.

    喜看革命接班人在成长
    “春天就要到来，我要带上毛主席著作，扛起新锄头，走上生产第一线。”我们的革命接班人、新任县委书记、副书记，怀着这样的决心，迎接一九六六年的春天。
    本报今天选载了周明山、郭建杰、董志文、刘观水、刘云瑞、苏海澄等同志的文章，这些文章字里行间闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。我们十分高兴地看到：在我国社会主义革命和建设事业大发展的今天，在毛泽东思想哺育下，无产阶级革命事业接班人一批又一批地成长起来。他们觉悟高，干劲大，信心百倍地走上新的岗位。这是我们国家的兴旺气象。
    永远学习毛泽东同志的著作，永远密切联系群众，永远扛着锄头，永远战斗在第一线。我们的革命接班人牢牢记住和做到这几条，我们的革命事业就会越来越兴旺。
    接班，首先是要接毛泽东思想的班，也就是用毛泽东思想把头脑武装起来，将社会主义革命进行到底。山西绛县南樊公社南柳大队党支部书记周明山，最近被提拔为中共绛县县委书记。周明山成长的过程，就是学习和掌握毛泽东思想的过程。长期坚持不懈地学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习和运用毛泽东同志最坚定最彻底的无产阶级革命精神和最灵活最巧妙的斗争艺术，使他能在大风大浪的阶级斗争里站稳立场，在艰巨、复杂的生产斗争中领导群众战胜一个又一个的困难。今天，他在开始担任县委书记职务的时候，自觉地把进一步活学活用毛泽东思想当成做好新的工作的前提。
    为什么周明山等同志对毛泽东同志的著作抱有这样深厚的感情？这是因为，他们是在群众斗争中闯出来的。他们按照毛泽东同志的教导办事，每前进一步，对毛泽东思想的体会就深一步，对毛泽东同志著作的感情就深一步。他们从切身体会中懂得了毛泽东思想是最伟大最生动的思想力量，是指导中国革命和世界革命的法宝。对一个革命接班人来说，如果要求自己更快地在政治上成熟起来，能够担起党和人民交给自己的重担，就必须刻苦地不间断地学习毛主席著作，把这件大事放在一切工作的首要地位。只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，自然就能永远密切联系群众，永不放下锄头，永不离开第一线了。
    随着社会主义革命的深入和建设事业的发展，努力培养新生力量，把德才兼备的后起之秀提拔到领导岗位上来，这是革命事业的需要，也是客观事物发展的必然规律。这是关系无产阶级革命前途的头等大事，我们一定要严肃热情地作好这件大事。
    我们考虑一切问题的出发点，只能是党和人民事业的利益，而不能是其他。从这一点出发，我们在干部问题上，必须坚持德才兼备、又红又专的原则。有德，才能全心全意为人民服务；有才，才能卓有成效地为人民服务。一个干部的德和才，是同他的斗争经历相联系的，但主要地决定于对毛泽东同志著作的学习和运用。从德才着眼，谁能挑多重的担子，就要他挑多重的担子。有个人主义思想的人，害怕学生超过老师。其实，学生超过老师，新干部超过老干部，是件好事，我们理当为此感到高兴。老师继续全力以赴地进行工作，并且帮助学生超过自己，这种革命胸怀和高尚情操，对于学生来说，永远都是老师。今天，在各地区、在各个战线上，许多革命的老前辈对选拔的新干部，热情帮助，严格要求，使他们在各个领导岗位上充分发挥作用，这是对党对人民革命事业高度负责的表现，是值得赞扬的。
    革命者总是在发扬成绩、改正错误中逐渐成熟起来的。被提拔到领导工作岗位上的同志，工作中一定会碰到困难，也难免出一些毛病。但是，这并没有什么可怕。在温室里培养出来的东西，不会有强大的生命力。因此，要放手让他们到斗争的风雨中间去闯，去锻炼。也只有这样，红色的革命接班人才能培养出来。新提拔的同志应该认识，党把自己提拔到领导岗位上来，是革命的需要，决不是让自己当官作老爷。因此要戒骄戒躁，虚心地向老同志学习，向群众学习，要坚持参加集体生产劳动，一刻也不脱离人民群众。
    毛泽东同志说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”这是对革命接班人最高的信任，也是最有力的鼓励和鞭策。
