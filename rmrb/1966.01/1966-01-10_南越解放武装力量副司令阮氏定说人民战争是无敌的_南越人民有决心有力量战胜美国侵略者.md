    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th) Nguyen Thi Dinh, Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, recently called on the South Vietnamese army and people at a summary meeting to further mobilize and strike at the American aggressors on the basis of last year's victories.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh recently delivered a report on the people's guerrilla warfare at a summary meeting of the people and guerrillas of Thu Dau Mot Province and War Zone D in South Vietnam on the combat achievements of November and December 1965. South Vietnam Liberation News Agency reported on her report.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh said that in the two months of November and December last year, the people and guerrillas of Thu Dau Mot Province and War Zone D annihilated 2,000 American aggressors and their puppet troops, making a positive contribution to defeating the "Dry Season Offensive Plan" implemented by the American bandits and their lackeys in the eastern part of South Vietnam.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh pointed out that this area of ​​vigorous guerrilla warfare surrounds the military bases of the American aggressor troops and their puppet troops, and constantly consumes the strength of the American bandits everywhere. Wherever the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade and the 1st Infantry Division reached, they were attacked, not only by the powerful attacks of the main forces of the Liberation Army, such as in Bau Bang, Dau Tieng, and Dau Kho, but also by heavy blows from guerrillas and the people, such as in War Zone D, Nam Ben Cat, and Lai Thieu. The guerrillas in this area also frequently infiltrated the rear of the American bandits' garrisons to carry out activities, containing the strength of the American aggressor troops in various places. The guerrillas repeatedly attacked the leading organs and garrison camps of the American bandits with small-scale surprise attacks, making their rear unstable, making them uneasy, and keeping them mentally tense, forcing them to free up considerable strength to defend the rear, restricting their mobility, and creating favorable conditions for the main forces to eliminate the enemy.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh said that the guerrillas in this area also constantly destroyed the enemy's transportation lines, putting the American bandits in an extremely difficult situation. The logistical supplies needed by the American aggressor troops on the southern battlefield are five or ten times more than those of the puppet troops.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh pointed out that the guerrillas in this area not only fragmented the enemy's strength, but also eliminated American troops in entire platoons and companies.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh emphasized: "Looking back at the outstanding achievements of the guerrilla warfare in Thu Dau Mot Province and War Zone D in annihilating American bandits, just like the battles in Da Nang, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai, we have enough practice to draw the conclusion: With the U.S. expeditionary forces increasingly directly invading the South, the role and position of guerrilla warfare has not changed, but has been further consolidated.”
    Nguyen Thi Dinh said that the South Vietnamese people combine all work with resistance to America, such as digging fortifications, building combat villages, guarding posts, and collecting unexploded bombs. Many places have put forward the slogan: "American bandits are irreconcilable enemies, annihilate them when you meet them." The entire South Vietnamese people have taken on the task of resisting America and saving the country, and believe that they will be able to defeat the American bandits, so they are very determined.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh said that at present, all the South Vietnamese people have joined the ranks of attacking the American aggressor troops. Not only strong young men and women directly participate in the battle to annihilate American bandits, but also the elderly and children try every means to annihilate American bandits. Those who cannot directly participate in the battle go to dig trenches, build fortifications, sharpen bamboo spikes, support the front lines, gather intelligence for the guerrillas, and monitor the enemy. Everything is to concentrate the spearhead to resist and annihilate the American bandits. She said that in the past, the puppet troops were utterly defeated by the invincible power of the people's war. Today, the American troops have also been beaten to pieces and are deeply mired in the quagmire of defeat.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh pointed out that the guerrillas and the people's fight to eliminate American bandits is very flexible, rich, and diverse. The guerrillas' specialties are sniping, sparrow warfare, raids, small-scale ambushes, especially mine warfare, setting traps, and so on. The guerrillas can quickly discover the enemy's stupid weaknesses and patterns of action, and adopt various tactics very flexibly according to the enemy's weaknesses and patterns of activity. The guerrillas have a courageous spirit. They are familiar with the terrain, and the whole people participate in resisting America, and the whole people offer ideas for resisting America. This makes guerrilla tactics even richer and more widely used.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh pointed out that the reserve strength of guerrilla warfare is endless. Everyone is an American-annihilating fighter. Traps, bamboo spikes, iron caltrops, mines, mantis guns, etc. are everywhere, and anyone can make them. No matter how long the war lasts, these weapons will never run out. "As long as the enemy exists, there are weapons to strike the enemy," is a saying of the people in Nam Ben Cat, which clearly embodies the idea of people's war.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh emphasized: "Therefore, even if we have to fight for five, ten, twenty years, or even longer, our people will never feel that manpower is exhausted or weapons are lacking in the fight against the American bandits."
    Nguyen Thi Dinh then put forward five main tasks to launch a nationwide movement to resist America and save the country, and further develop the great power and potential of guerrilla warfare. She said that leaders at all levels must directly lead and guide the movement to resist America and save the country, and extensively mobilize and mobilize all the people to make full preparations; consolidate and strengthen the guerrillas in various places to make them the backbone of the American-annihilating movement; build a solid rear; coordinate the activities of the main forces, local troops, and guerrillas, and closely combine armed struggle with the development of political struggle and troop transport work; and continue to eliminate the puppet troops to create favorable conditions for eliminating the American troops.
    She said: To develop the annihilation of American troops into a powerful, deep, and widespread movement of the whole people, we must do a good job in the above five tasks, the most important of which is the leadership role of all levels. Only with good leadership can we organize well and guide the anti-American movement in the right direction.
    Nguyen Thi Dinh said: "Our entire South Vietnamese army and people have achieved brilliant results in the battle to eliminate American troops." "The American expeditionary forces have exposed their weak essence. The invincible power of our people's war is becoming clearer and clearer in the course of the war. It is completely believable that our people have the ability to resist the American aggressor troops and defeat them."

    南越解放武装力量副司令阮氏定说人民战争是无敌的
    南越人民有决心有力量战胜美国侵略者
    据新华社河内九日电　越南南方解放武装力量副司令阮氏定最近在一次总结大会上号召越南南方军民在去年一年的胜利基础上进一步动员起来，打击美国侵略者。
    阮氏定最近在越南南方土龙木省和D战区人民和游击队总结一九六五年十一月和十二月的战斗成绩大会上作了关于人民游击战争的报告。越南南方解放通讯社报道了她的报告。
    阮氏定说，在去年十一月和十二月两个月中，土龙木省和D战区的人民和游击队歼灭了二千名美国侵略者及其仆从军，为击败美国强盗及其走狗在南部东区推行的“旱季进攻计划”作出了积极贡献。
    阮氏定指出，这个游击战争蓬勃发展的地区包围着美国侵略军及其仆从军的军事基地，到处和不断地消耗美国强盗的力量。美国第一七三空降旅和第一步兵师摸到什么地方，就在什么地方遭到打击，不仅遭到解放军主力部队的有力打击，如在保邦、甘车、石湖等地；而且还遭到游击队和人民的沉重打击，如在D战区、南边葛、莱眺等地。这个地区的游击队还经常潜入美国强盗驻地的后方进行活动，牵制各地美国侵略军的力量。游击队以小规模突然袭击的打法，多次袭击了美国强盗的首脑机关、驻军营地，使他们的后方无法稳定，使他们坐卧不安，精神经常处于紧张状态，逼使他们要腾出相当多的力量来保卫后方，限制了他们的机动性，为主力部队消灭敌军创造了有利条件。
    阮氏定说，这个地区的游击队还不断破坏敌人的交通运输线，使美国强盗的处境极端困难。美国侵略军在南方战场上所需要的后勤供应要比伪军多五倍、十倍。
    阮氏定指出，这个地区的游击队不仅零星地消耗敌人的力量，而且整排、整连地消灭美军。
    阮氏定强调说：“回顾土龙木省、D战区歼灭美国强盗的游击战争的出色成绩，正如岘港、广南、广义等地的战斗一样，我们有足够的实践来作出结论：在美国远征军日益直接侵略南方的情况下，游击战争的作用和地位仍然没有改变，而且还得到进一步的巩固。”
    阮氏定说，越南南方人民把一切工作都同抗美结合起来，如挖掘工事、建设战斗乡、战斗村、站岗、搜集未爆炸的炸弹等。许多地方提出的口号是：“美国强盗是不共戴天的仇人，遇见就歼”。南越全体人民担负起抗美救国的任务，并且相信一定能够战胜美国强盗，因此决心很大。
    阮氏定说，目前，全体南越人民都参加了打击美国侵略军的行列。不但强壮的男女青年直接参加歼灭美国强盗的战斗，而且老人、少年也想方设法歼灭美国强盗。不能直接参加战斗的人，就去挖掘战壕、筑工事、削竹尖、支援前线、为游击队打听情报、监视敌人等。一切都是为了集中矛头抗击和歼灭美国强盗。她说，过去，伪军被人民战争的无敌力量打得一败涂地，今天，美军同样被打得落花流水，深深陷入失败的泥潭。
    阮氏定指出，游击队和人民消灭美国强盗的战斗，打法十分灵活、丰富，形式多种多样。游击队的特长是放冷枪、打麻雀战、袭击、小规模伏击，特别是地雷战、设陷阱等等。游击队能够很快地发现敌人愚笨的弱点和行动的规律，并根据敌人的弱点和活动规律，十分灵活地采用各种战术。游击队具有勇敢精神。他们熟悉地形，加之全民参加抗美，全民为抗美献计。这就使游击战术更加得到丰富和广泛运用。
    阮氏定指出，游击战争的后备力量是无穷无尽的。每一个人都是一个歼美战士。陷阱、竹蒺藜、铁蒺藜、地雷、螳螂枪等到处都有，谁都可以制造，不管战争打多久，这些武器也是用不完的。“敌人还存在，就有打击敌人的武器”，这是南边葛地区人民的一句口头语，它明确地体现了人民战争的思想。
    阮氏定强调说：“因此，尽管要打五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，我们人民在抗击美国强盗的战斗中，永远不会感到人力枯竭，武器缺乏。”
    阮氏定接着提出五项主要任务来发动全民参加抗美救国运动，进一步发挥游击战争的巨大威力和潜力。她说，各级领导必须直接领导和指导抗美救国运动，深入广泛地发动、动员全体人民作好充分准备；巩固和壮大各地游击队，使之成为歼美运动的骨干；建设稳固的后方；协调主力部队、地方部队和游击队的活动，紧密结合武装斗争与政治斗争和兵运工作的开展；继续消灭伪军，为消灭美军创造有利条件。
    她说：要把歼灭美军发展成为全民的强大、深入和广泛的运动，就必须良好地作好上述五项工作，其中最重要的一条是各级的领导作用。只有领导得好，才能组织得好，才能指导抗美运动向正确方向前进。
    阮氏定说：“我们全南方的军民在消灭美军的战斗中已经取得了辉煌的成绩。”“美国远征军已经暴露出它们的虚弱的本质。我们人民战争的无敌力量在战争的过程中显示得越来越清楚。完全可以相信，我们人民有能力抗击美国侵略军，并战胜它。”
