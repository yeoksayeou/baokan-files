    To Ensure Unimpeded Roads, Regardless of Wind and Snow
    ——A Record of the Road Maintenance Workers at the Que'er Mountain Pass on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway

    Travelers on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, when they mention the dozen or so road maintenance workers at the Que'er Mountain Pass, all unanimously praise them as examples for everyone to follow.

    These road maintenance workers, with the whole country in their hearts and the world in their eyes, wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution, have overcome the unpredictable climate of wind, snow, ice, and hail on the plateau. They maintain this section of highway, located at an altitude of over 4,000 meters, very well, enabling vehicles to cross this high mountain smoothly and steadily.  Not wanting to cause trouble, they offer convenience to travelers and drivers, allowing them to spend snowy nights warmly and comfortably. The touching deeds of these road maintenance workers laboring for the revolution have left people with an unforgettable impression.

    Que'er Mountain is known for its high altitude, thin air, and severely cold climate. Frost occurs here in all seasons, with eight months of freezing temperatures. Snow accumulation often reaches over one meter, and temperatures are frequently between twenty and thirty degrees below zero. During the deep winter season, strong winds mixed with snow particles blow from morning till night. Even during the three or four months after the ice and snow melt, the weather changes drastically throughout the day: sometimes strong winds blow, sometimes heavy rain pours down, sometimes the scorching sun beats down, and sometimes hailstorms lash down. Here, not a single blade of grass grows, and there isn't even a ditch for water. Firewood for daily life has to be cut and transported from the foot of the mountain, ten or twenty li away. For drinking water, they melt snow in winter and use rainwater in summer. Despite such harsh conditions and such difficult lives, the Que'er Mountain road maintenance workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, realize that doing road maintenance work and keeping the highway in good condition is an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause, and that this place is an important front for defending the motherland's borders, prospering the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau, and building socialism. Therefore, they cheerfully fight and live here with revolutionary spirit. When there's no firewood on the mountain, everyone uses their Sundays to go down the mountain to cut and transport it; when there's difficulty getting water, they dig two dry wells to store ice, snow, and rainwater; when rice doesn't cook well, the cook thinks of ways to improve the cooking method, steaming steamed buns, baking biscuits, and frying fried dough sticks in the morning, and then cooking rice when the weather is good at noon.

    They treat their work with the interests of the revolution in mind, doing everything possible to maintain the highway well. In the winter on Que'er Mountain, the snow on the road surface is more than one meter thick, which is when vehicle obstruction and skidding are most likely to occur. To avoid this, since 1964, they have regularly maintained the snowplows and sent people to inspect the highway every day. When it snows or snowdrifts are blown up by the wind, they either sweep it away manually or use the snowplow to clear it, clearing the accumulated snow on the same day to keep the highway open. During the snowmelt period in May and June, snowmelt from the top of the mountain washes onto the highway, eroding the road surface into potholes, making it difficult to drive. They use a large amount of crushed stone prepared in advance to pave the road surface and dig drainage ditches. Through their efforts, they have achieved excellent results with a 100% good road rate. From November 1964 to the end of August 1965, although there was particularly more rain and snow than in previous years, there were no vehicle obstruction incidents lasting more than half a day.

    Although it is difficult to get drinking water and firewood on the mountain, whenever a car passes by, the workers in the road maintenance station will bring a cup of hot tea to the travelers. When they stop for the night, they will bring the travelers into the road maintenance station, allowing them to eat delicious meals and sleep warm and comfortably for the night. One day in July 1964, there was a strong wind and heavy snow on the mountain, and a section of the road was blocked by a landslide, stranding more than thirty vehicles and seventy travelers on the top of the mountain, who were cold and hungry. At this time, the road maintenance workers sent people to provide warm reception. After settling all the travelers in the road maintenance station, they busied themselves boiling water and cooking. The cook, fearing that the guests were not used to the butter tea-flavored food, specially used the few remaining pounds of cooking oil to fry pancakes and stir-fry fresh vegetables. In the evening, they gave all the beds to the guests, while they themselves stayed up all night by the fire in the courtyard.

    The Que'er Mountain road maintenance workers, with such a full revolutionary zeal, wholeheartedly serve the travelers, overcome various difficulties, and ensure the smooth flow of the Sichuan-Tibet Highway. The most fundamental reason why they have this revolutionary spirit is that they conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works and constantly enhance their ideological awareness of serving the people. Of the dozen or so people in the whole team, except for the three workers who came earlier, the other workers have been transferred here in recent years. The ten fingers are not all the same length, and everyone's political and ideological awareness is also different. Therefore, the work of the whole team was not smooth sailing from the beginning. Since 1963, after everyone studied Chairman Mao's articles "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," they realized that maintaining the Que'er Mountain highway well is a concrete manifestation of serving the people, and they should not be afraid of hardship, should not consider personal gains and losses, and should not bargain about work. Everyone clarified for whom they were working, and they became motivated to work, and finally figured out the rules for road maintenance on the top of Que'er Mountain, and successfully completed the task.

    为保道路通无阻  哪管风雪漫天来
    ——记川藏公路雀儿山垭口的道班工人
    往来于川藏公路的旅客，提起雀儿山上垭口的十几个道班工人，都一致称赞说，他们是大家学习的榜样。
    这些道班工人，胸怀全国，放眼世界，一心为革命，战胜了高原风雪冰雹变化无常的气候，把这段位于海拔四千多米高的公路维修得很好，使汽车平稳、顺利地越过这座高山。他们不嫌麻烦，把方便送给旅客、驾驶员，让他们温暖、舒适地度过风雪之夜。这些道班工人为革命而劳动的感人事迹，给人们留下了难以忘怀的印象。
    雀儿山以海拔高、空气稀薄、气候严寒著称。这里一年四季都有霜冻出现，有八个月是冰冻期，积雪常达一米以上，气温经常在零下二三十度。每到深冬季节，狂风夹着雪粒从早刮到晚。就是冰消雪化后的三四个月时间内，一天的气候也是变化多端：时而狂风大作，时而大雨倾盆，时而烈日曝晒，时而冰雹倾泻。这里，寸草不生，连一条水沟也没有。日常生活用的烧柴，要到一二十里外的山下砍运。吃水冬天靠化雪，夏天用雨水。环境尽管这样恶劣，生活尽管这样艰苦，但是以毛泽东思想武装起来的雀儿山道班工人，认识到干道班工作，养好公路，是革命事业不可缺少的一部分，而这里又是保卫祖国边防、繁荣川藏高原、建设社会主义的重要阵地。因此，他们以革命精神愉快地战斗在这里，生活在这里。山上没柴烧，大家利用星期天下山砍运；吃水困难，就打了两口旱井，把冰雪雨水积存起来；饭煮不熟，炊事员想办法改进煮饭方法，早上蒸花卷、烤饼子、炸油条，中午气候好时再煮饭。
    他们对待工作更是处处以革命的利益为重，想尽办法把公路养好。雀儿山的冬天，路面积雪达一米多厚，这是最容易发生阻车滑车事件的时候。为了避免发生这种情况，自一九六四年以来，他们平时把推雪机维修好，每天又派人在公路沿线察看。一遇下雪或被风吹起雪埂，不是用人工扫，就是用推雪机推，做到当天积雪当天清除，保持公路畅通。在五、六月化雪期间，山顶雪水冲到公路上，把路面冲刷成坑坑洼洼，不好行车，他们就用平时准备好的大批碎石料铺路面，挖好排水沟。经过他们的努力，出现了好路率达到百分之一百的优良成绩。自一九六四年十一月到一九六五年八月底，虽然雨雪比往年特别多，却没发生过半天以上的阻车事件。
    尽管山上吃水烧柴都很困难，只要有汽车路过，道班房的工人们会把一杯一杯热茶端到旅客面前。停车过夜时，他们又会把旅客接到道班房内，让你吃上可口的饭菜，温暖舒适地睡一夜。一九六四年七月间的一天，山上狂风大作，大雪纷飞，一段路面被塌方阻塞，三十多部车子被阻在山顶，七十多位旅客在车上又冷又饿。正在这时，道班工人们派来了热情接待的人。他们把所有旅客安顿在道班房之后，又忙着烧水煮饭。炊事员怕客人初到高原，吃不惯酥油做的饭菜，特地用仅存的几斤清油煎油饼、炒鲜菜。晚上，他们把所有床铺让给客人，自己却在院坝里烤火熬夜。
    雀儿山道班工人们就是以这种满腔的革命热情，全心全意为旅客服务，克服了各种各样困难，保证了川藏公路的畅通。他们为什么有这种革命精神，最根本的是认真学习了毛主席著作，不断增强了为人民服务的思想觉悟。全班十多个人，除三个工人来得较早外，其他工人都是最近几年内陆续调来的。十个手指不一般齐，各人的政治思想觉悟也有高低。因此全班的工作并不是一开始便是一帆风顺的。自从一九六三年开始，大家学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章后，认识到养好雀儿山公路就是为人民服务的具体表现，不应该怕艰苦，不应该考虑个人得失，不应该对工作讲价钱，大家明确了为谁劳动，做工作就有了干劲，终于摸出在雀儿山顶养路的规律，出色地完成了任务。
