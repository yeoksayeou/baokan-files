    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 7th January: According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 7th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk warned the United States and its lackeys at a mass rally in Bareybov Village, Kampong Chhnang Province, on the 6th: "I have every reason to believe that our enemies will not only fail to swallow us as easily as they imagine, but that we are entirely capable of defeating them."
    He said, "As I have often pointed out, the war waged by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against neutral Cambodia will have dangerous international consequences for the free world. Especially for the Americans—let's just talk about the people of the Indochinese peninsula—they will face many tenacious opponents: the Viet Cong alone have driven them to the end of their rope; as for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, its capabilities are well known; the Cambodian people are as tenacious as the Vietnamese patriots; and there is also the Lao Patriotic Front and the Thai Patriotic Front, the Thai Patriotic Front has already caused Kittikachorn, Charusathien and Thanat Khoman much anxiety. Can the U.S. imperialists resist the people of our Indochinese countries for long?"
    Prince Sihanouk said, "Thailand has completely lost its independence. Under the corrupt regime in Bangkok, Thailand is in a bad situation, and the Thai people are living a miserable life. The traitor Son Ngoc Thanh, on the contrary, wants Cambodia and the Cambodian people to suffer the bitterness of this kind of 'independence,' 'democratic system,' and standard of living."
    Prince Sihanouk pointed out that his "swift and decisive reaction" to the American conspiracy to directly invade Cambodia was "doing what we should do." He said, "We will never soften," "The attitude we have taken is the attitude we will take." (Attached picture)

    西哈努克亲王警告美国及其仆从
    柬埔寨人民能够打败敌人
    美国扩大战争将面对印度支那人民坚决对抗
    新华社金边七日电  据柬埔寨新闻社七日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王六日在磅清扬省巴雷勃村的一次群众大会上警告美国及其仆从：“我有充分理由相信，我们的敌人不仅不能象他们所想象的那样容易地把我们吞掉，而且我们完全有可能打败他们。”
    他说，“正如我经常指出的那样，美帝国主义及其走狗对中立的柬埔寨发动的战争，将给自由世界在国际上带来危险的后果。特别对于美国人来说——姑且只谈印度支那半岛人民——他们将面对许多顽强的对手：单单越共就已把他们弄得走投无路；至于越南民主共和国，它的能耐是众所周知的；柬埔寨人民也象越南爱国者一样顽强；还有老挝爱国战线党和泰国爱国阵线，泰国爱国阵线已使吉滴卡宗、乍鲁沙天和他纳·科曼忧虑重重。难道美帝国主义者能长期对抗我们印度支那各国人民么？”
    西哈努克亲王说，“泰国已经完全丧失独立，在曼谷的腐败政权下，泰国处境恶劣，泰国人民过着悲惨的生活。卖国贼山玉成反倒要使柬埔寨和柬埔寨人民去吃这种‘独立’、‘民主制度’和生活水平的苦头。”
    西哈努克亲王指出，他对美国阴谋直接入侵柬埔寨所采取的“迅速而果断的反应”，是“做了我们应该做的事。”他说，“我们是决不会软下来的”，“我们已经采取的态度就是我们将要采取的态度。”（附图片）
