    Discussion on "Realizing the Revolutionization of County Committee Leadership and Building a New Socialist Countryside" 25
    Where Exactly Lies the Root of the Problem?
    On November 8th of last year, this column published Comrade Lü Jian's letter: "The Root of the Problem is Not Here." This letter raised a different view on the newspaper's discussion of the "serving whom" issue, arguing that the key to the revolutionization of the county committee was not the issue of "serving whom," but rather the issue of "how to serve." Many readers sent letters expressing their opinions on this understanding, sharing their views from different positions and based on different experiences. Some units even launched heated discussions on this issue. Due to space limitations, this newspaper publishes excerpts of some of the letters below.
    Recently, Comrade Lü Jian sent another letter discussing his new understanding, which is also published here. Editor
    Old and New Cadres All Need to Be Re-Educated
    In the discussion of realizing the revolutionization of county committee leadership, some comrades believe that the "serving whom" issue has been basically resolved, and the key issue is "how to serve." The reasons are: first, everyone "knows" whom we are "serving"; second, everyone is "of one heart and one mind with the people, working hard," and wants to "do a good job of revolutionary work," and many comrades have even gone through "mountains of knives and seas of fire"; third, the reason work is not outstanding "is mainly a matter of leadership methods," and it also "involves leadership organs above the county level."
    In my opinion, many county committee leaders or many comrades of the county committee have not clearly resolved the "serving whom" issue. Some people may not have resolved it at all. What I mean is not that they don't "know" in theory or verbally, but that in practice and action, they are not serving the people wholeheartedly. The materials published in this column alone are enough to illustrate this problem. For example, some counties have a "Great Laziness Spirit," emphasizing "keeping to one's duties," being content with the status quo, relying solely on the state, not accepting mass opinions, and rampant "five excesses"; some county committee comrades are dominated by the word "fear," putting "self" first, prioritizing "stability," and valuing harmony; some have thoughts of being "officials" and enjoying themselves, and so on. Can this be said to be "serving the people wholeheartedly" and being "of one heart and one mind with the people"? Even in counties that have undergone the Socialist Education Movement, this problem still exists. Zhuji County is a good example. Poor and lower-middle peasants raised more than 5,000 suggestions, mainly criticizing the county committee for not supporting them enough, "not having peasants in their minds, and lacking a class viewpoint."
    According to what I know, most of the comrades of the county committee are good and relatively good, but many have problems in this regard. Even the good and relatively good comrades are not clear on the issue of class struggle and the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and often reflect some bourgeois ideas and cannot conscientiously implement the Party's policies, such as not caring enough and not supporting poor and lower-middle peasants enough. Therefore, I agree with many comrades who have proposed that there is also class struggle within the county committee; otherwise, we would not need to prevent the restoration of capitalism and prevent the emergence of revisionism.
    Comrades who have gone through "mountains of knives and seas of fire" may have a firm class stand and strong class feelings. But people's thinking changes. If they think they have become "officials" and gradually become detached from the masses in their lives, their stand and feelings will change. A problem that deserves attention is that many of our old revolutionary comrades were ideologically prepared for the democratic revolution, but they lack preparation for the socialist revolution. Therefore, after the national revolution succeeded, some people's thinking stagnated, thinking that "the revolution has already succeeded" and there is no need to continue the revolution. Therefore, even some comrades who have gone through "mountains of knives and seas of fire" will become detached from the people if they do not pay attention to the corrosion of bourgeois ideology.
    Of course, it is also wrong to mechanically separate the "serving whom" and "how to serve" issues. If the "serving whom" issue is truly resolved, the "how to serve" issue is not difficult to resolve. Many problems that seem to be "how to serve" problems on the surface, such as the "five excesses," the lack of "staying at selected spots," etc., actually reflect a state of mind. If one truly thinks of the people, truly takes the suffering of the poor and lower-middle peasants as one's own suffering and the happiness of the poor and lower-middle peasants as one's own happiness, then why can't one stay at selected spots, and why must one sit in the office and engage in bureaucracy?
    If the county committee leadership truly achieves wholehearted service to the people, it can also criticize and make active suggestions on the issue of "involving leadership organs above the county level."
    In my opinion, now, whether it is a comrade who joined the revolution early or a comrade who joined the revolution late, a comrade with high education or a comrade with low education, an old comrade or a young comrade, and no matter what the background of the comrade, the "serving whom" issue exists. All need to re-learn and be re-educated. That is where the root of the problem lies!

    “实现县委领导革命化，建设社会主义新农村”的讨论25
    症结到底在哪里？
    去年十一月八日，本栏发表了吕健同志来信：《症结不在这儿》，这封信对报纸讨论“为谁服务”问题，提出了不同的看法，认为县委革命化的关键不是“为谁服务”的问题，而是“怎样服务”的问题。很多读者来信对这种认识提出意见，大家从不同的岗位，根据不同的经历和体会，谈了自己的看法。有的单位还就这个问题，开展了热烈的讨论。本报限于篇幅，摘要发表部分来信如下。
    最近，吕健同志又来信谈了他的新的认识，也一并发表在这里。编者
    新老干部都需要重新受教育
    在实现县委领导革命化的讨论中，有的同志认为，现在“为谁服务”的问题已基本上解决了，而关键问题是“怎样服务”。理由是：第一，大家都“知道”我们是“为谁服务”的；第二，大家都是和“人民同心同德，艰苦奋斗”，“想把革命工作搞好”，不少同志还经过“刀山火海”；第三，工作不出色“主要原因是领导方法问题”，而且还“牵扯到县以上的领导机关”。
    我认为，现在，很多县委领导或县委的很多同志，“为谁服务”的问题并没有得到明确的解决。有的人还可能根本没有解决。我的意思不是说，他们在理论上、口头上不“知道”，而是在实际上、行动上不是全心全意为人民服务的。单是本栏发表的材料就足够说明这个问题了。例如有的县有“大赖精神”，强调“守本分”、满足现状，单纯依靠国家，不接受群众意见，“五多”泛滥；有些县委同志“怕”字当头，“我”字当先，“稳”字当道，以和为贵；有的存在当“官”、享受思想等等。这能说是“全心全意为人民服务”，和“人民同心同德”吗？就是经过社会主义教育运动的县来说，也同样存在这个问题。诸暨县就是一个很好的例子，贫农下中农提出五千多条意见，主要是批评县委对他们支持不够，“心目中没有农民，缺乏阶级观点”。
    据我所知道的情况，县委的同志多数是好的和比较好的，但也有不少在这方面是有问题的，就是好的、比较好的同志，也不是在阶级斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争问题上都是明确的，常常反映一些资产阶级思想，不能认真贯彻执行党的方针政策，例如对于贫农下中农关心不够，支持不够等。所以，我同意很多同志提出的县委内部也有阶级斗争，否则我们就不需要防止资本主义的复辟，防止出现修正主义了。
    经过“刀山火海”的同志，可能阶级立场是坚定的，阶级感情是浓厚的。但是人的思想是会变的，如果认为自己当上“官”了，生活上逐渐脱离群众，立场、感情就会起变化。值得注意的一个问题是，我们很多老革命同志对民主革命是有思想准备的，而对社会主义革命是缺乏准备的。因此，全国革命胜利以后，有些人的思想就停顿起来，认为“革命已经成功了”，不需要继续革命了。所以，就是一些经过“刀山火海”的同志，不注意资产阶级思想的腐蚀，同样是会脱离人民的。
    当然，把“为谁服务”和“怎样服务”的问题机械地分开也不对。“为谁服务”的问题真正解决了，“怎样服务”的问题是不难解决的。许多问题表面上看起来是“怎样服务”的问题，如“五多”呀，“蹲点”少啦等等，实际都反映了一个精神状态问题。如果真正是为人民群众着想，真正以贫农下中农的苦为自己的苦、以贫农下中农的乐为自己的乐，那么他为什么蹲不下去，非要坐在机关搞官僚主义呢？
    如果县委领导是真正做到全心全意为人民群众的话，对“牵扯到县以上的领导机关”的问题，也可以提出批评和积极的建议。
    我认为，现在不论参加革命早的同志和参加革命晚的同志，文化高的同志和文化低的同志，年纪老的同志和年纪轻的同志，也不论是什么出身的同志，都存在“为谁服务”的问题。都需要重新学习，重新受教育。症结就在这里！
