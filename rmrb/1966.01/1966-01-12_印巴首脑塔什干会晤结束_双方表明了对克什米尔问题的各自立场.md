    Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent, January 11th: The meeting between the leaders of India and Pakistan, which began on January 4th in Tashkent, Soviet Union, concluded on the 10th. Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Kosygin, as the initiator and host, participated in the meeting.

    At the conclusion of the meeting, a "Tashkent Declaration" was issued, signed in two copies respectively by Pakistani President Ayub Khan and Indian Prime Minister Shastri.

    The declaration stated that the two leaders "reaffirmed their obligation, under the (United Nations) Charter, to settle their disputes by peaceful means rather than by the use of force." They "discussed the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, and both sides stated their respective positions."

    The declaration stated that the two leaders "agreed that all armed personnel of both countries shall be withdrawn to the positions they held prior to August 5, 1965, no later than February 25, 1966."

    The declaration also mentioned that the two sides would restore the normal functioning of their diplomatic missions; agreed to consider measures to restore economic, trade, transportation, and cultural exchanges between the two countries; and stated that "both sides will continue to hold talks at the highest and other levels to discuss issues directly related to the two countries."

    According to reports, after the meeting began, Pakistani President Ayub Khan suggested first discussing the Kashmir issue, believing that only by guaranteeing the right to self-determination of the people of Kashmir could the root cause of the conflict between India and Pakistan be eliminated. However, Indian Prime Minister Shastri insisted that Kashmir was an integral part of India and not open to negotiation.

    Regarding India's proposal for India and Pakistan to issue a non-aggression declaration or sign a non-aggression treaty, Pakistan's *Morning News* quoted Pakistani spokesman Gauhar on the 8th as saying, "Some have suggested that we should discuss certain non-central issues, conclude a non-aggression treaty or non-aggression agreement. We said that peace cannot be established merely by a piece of paper." He emphasized that eliminating the root cause of the Indo-Pakistani conflict was a prerequisite for reaching an agreement, and that the root cause was the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.

    After the signing of the Tashkent Declaration, a Pakistani spokesman said: "This is a declaration of intent." "Although the declaration covers a wide range, it is not enough." Pakistan hopes that more actions will be taken to help resolve the Kashmir issue.

    An Indian spokesman said: "The declaration did not solve any problems, but opened up avenues for solving problems." The main purpose of the declaration "is not to start negotiations on any specific issue."

    印巴首脑塔什干会晤结束
    双方表明了对克什米尔问题的各自立场
    新华社十一日讯　塔什干消息：印度和巴基斯坦两国首脑一月四日在苏联塔什干开始举行的会晤，已在十日结束。作为倡议者和东道主的苏联部长会议主席柯西金参加了这次会晤。
    在会晤结束时，发表了一项由巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗和印度总理夏斯特里在两份文件上分别签署的“塔什干宣言”。
    宣言说，两国首脑“重申，根据（联合国）宪章，他们有义务不使用武力而是通过和平手段来解决他们的争端。”他们“讨论了查谟和克什米尔问题，双方表明了各自的立场。”
    宣言说，两国首脑“一致同意，两国一切武装人员最迟不晚于一九六六年二月二十五日都撤回到一九六五年八月五日以前所占领的阵地。”
    宣言还谈到双方将恢复两国外交使团的正常工作；同意考虑恢复两国之间的经济、贸易、交通运输以及文化交流的措施等问题，并说“双方将继续举行最高级和其它级会谈，讨论同两国直接有关的问题。”
    据报道，在会晤开始后，巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗建议首先讨论克什米尔问题，他认为，只有保证克什米尔人民的自决权，才能消除印巴两国冲突的根源。但是，印度总理夏斯特里坚持克什米尔是印度的一个组成部分，不容谈判。
    关于印度提出的印巴之间发表非战宣言或签订非战条约的问题，据巴基斯坦《晨报》援引巴基斯坦发言人高哈尔八日的谈话说，“有人向我们建议，我们应该讨论某些非中心问题，缔结非战条约或非战协定。我们说，和平不可能仅仅靠一纸文件来确立的。”他强调，消除印巴冲突的根源是达成协议的先决条件，而根源则是查谟和克什米尔问题。
    在塔什干宣言签字后，巴基斯坦发言人说：“这是一个意图宣言”。“虽然宣言涉及的范围很广，但是它还不够。”巴基斯坦希望采取更多的行动来帮助解决克什米尔问题。
    印度发言人说，“宣言没有解决任何问题，而是打开了解决问题的途径。”宣言的主要目的“不是要就任何具体问题开始举行谈判”。
