    "We Suffer a Little, and the People Will Be Happy"
    Public Security Personnel Actively Do Good Deeds for the People Around the Spring Festival
    (Xinhua News Agency, 24th) During the Spring Festival and the days surrounding it, public security personnel in various regions continued to do good deeds for the people, further improved their work, and further strengthened their ties with the masses.
    The loving-the-people activities of Shanghai's public security personnel entered a new high tide during the Spring Festival. More than thirty policemen from the Xietu Road Police Station of the Xuhui District Public Security Bureau arrived at the vegetable market at three o'clock in the morning, acting as both propagandists and salespersons. The director and police officers of the Changsha Road Police Station of the Huangpu District Public Security Bureau organized a cultural troupe and performed small choruses praising Wang Jie, Shanghai storytelling supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, and other programs in hotels, teahouses, and other public places. These days, comrades from the Xiaodongmen Police Station of the Nanshi District Public Security Bureau have been serving at the Shiliupu Wharf from morning till night, helping passengers carry luggage and assisting elderly and disabled passengers ashore.
    In Guangdong Province, during the loving-the-people month campaign, the enthusiasm of public security personnel for doing good deeds for the people has greatly increased due to highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. A few days before the Spring Festival, the Taikang Road Police Station in Guangzhou received a letter from an old woman, Huang Fuqiong, requesting assistance in finding her long-lost brother, Huang Biao, from whom she had been separated for fifty-five years. Policeman Liu Huanhua, inspired by the spirit of Wang Jie, used his spare time every day to inquire with the masses. After many days of hard work, he finally found out that Huang Biao had died of illness a few years ago, but he found one of Huang Fuqiong's older sisters, named Huang Nü, in Guangzhou. Soon, Huang Fuqiong was reunited with her relatives. The masses gratefully said that the old society caused families to be broken up, while the new society reunited them. When the infant of a compatriot from Hong Kong suffered from acute convulsions, Guangzhou policemen Zhang Hongqi and Huang Jinhong immediately called an ambulance and escorted the child to the hospital for emergency treatment, curing the child's illness. The Hong Kong compatriot said with emotion: "The public security police in the motherland are so good; they saved my child."
    Public security personnel in Beijing, Hebei, Liaoning, Hubei, Jiangsu, Ningxia, Shanxi, Yunnan, and other places have also tried every means to do good deeds for the masses. In Yin Chuan City, two wells on Limin Street could not be used because sewage flowed into them. The nearby masses had to fetch water from a great distance. A few days before the Spring Festival, Zhao Guotang, Deputy Director of the Yinchuan City Public Security Bureau, led twenty-nine comrades to dredge the wells. Everyone was not afraid of the cold or the dirt, and they drew the water dry bucket by bucket, and hoisted the sludge from the bottom of the well up basket by basket. After three hours, both wells were dredged. Many people's hands were red with cold, and their bodies were covered in mud, but their spirits were high. They said, "We suffer a little, and the people will be happy."
    During the loving-the-people month campaign, grassroots police stations in many places generally reported their work to the masses, widely solicited opinions from the masses, improved their work, and further strengthened police-people relations.

    “我们吃点苦，人民就会甜”
    公安人员春节前后积极为人民办好事
    据新华社二十四日讯　春节期间和春节前后，各地公安人员继续为人民办好事，进一步改进工作，进一步密切了和群众的联系。
    上海市公安人员的爱民活动，在春节期间进入新的高潮。徐汇区公安分局斜土路派出所三十多个民警，清晨三时，就到了菜场，既当宣传员，又做营业员。黄浦区公安分局长沙路派出所所长和民警组织了文艺队，到旅馆、茶楼等公共场所，演出了歌颂王杰的小合唱，支援越南人民抗美斗争的上海说唱等节目。南市区公安分局小东门派出所的同志们，这几天从早到晚，都到十六铺轮船码头服务，帮助旅客搬送行李，扶送年老残疾旅客上岸。
    广东省各地公安人员在爱民月运动中，由于突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，为人民办好事的积极性大大提高。春节前一些日子，广州市泰康路派出所接到老大娘黄福琼的一封信，要求帮助她寻找失散了五十五年的亲兄弟黄标。民警刘焕华在王杰精神鼓舞下，每天利用工余时间向群众查访，经过多天的辛勤劳动，终于查明黄标在几年前病死了，但在广州找到了黄福琼的一个姐姐，名叫黄女。不久，黄福琼就同亲人团聚了。象这样为群众找到了失散多年的亲人的事例，还有很多。群众感激说，旧社会使人妻离子散，新社会使人骨肉团圆。一位从香港来的同胞的婴孩得了急惊风，广州市民警张洪启、黄锦鸿马上叫来救护车，护送小孩到医院急救，把小孩的病治好了。这位香港同胞感动地说：“祖国的民警真好，是他们救了我的小孩。”
    北京、河北、辽宁、湖北、江苏、宁夏、山西、云南等地公安人员，也千方百计为群众办好事。银川市利民街有两口井，因为流入污水，不能用了。附近群众要到很远的地方去担水。春节前几天，银川市公安局副局长赵国堂，带领二十九个同志前去淘井。大家不怕冷，不怕脏，一桶一桶地把水打干，一筐一筐地把井底污泥吊上来。三个小时后，两口井都淘好了。许多人的手冻红了，满身泥浆，但情绪很高。他们说“我们吃点苦，人民就会甜。”
    在爱民月运动中，许多地方的基层派出所，普遍向群众报告了工作，广泛征求群众意见，改进了工作，进一步密切了警民关系。
