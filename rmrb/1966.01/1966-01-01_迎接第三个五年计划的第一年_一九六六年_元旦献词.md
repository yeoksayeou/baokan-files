Edition: 1

    1966 has arrived! This is the first year of our great Third Five-Year Plan. Our people of all nationalities, filled with boundless joy, are determined to strive for even greater achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction in this new year, and to make a successful start to the new Five-Year Plan.
    The Third Five-Year Plan is a magnificent plan for the development of the national economy for our people. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to deeply develop the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. We must carry out the socialist education movement more extensively in rural and urban areas; strive for annual increases in agricultural production, and more effectively implement the "National Agricultural Development Program"; on the basis of continuous technical innovation and continuous improvement of labor productivity, give full play to the production potential of existing industrial enterprises and the carrying capacity of the transportation industry, while vigorously building a number of new enterprises, strengthening national defense construction, strengthening basic industries, strengthening the transportation industry, further improving the layout of the national industry, and correspondingly developing light industry, gradually improving people's lives on the basis of production development, and establishing an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system. We must strive to catch up with and surpass the advanced level of world science and technology in 20 to 30 years, and build our country into a strong socialist country with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern national defense, and modern science and technology.
    Our Third Five-Year Plan is starting under conditions that are more favorable than ever before in the national economy since the national liberation.
    Since liberation, after the end of the period of national economic recovery, our country has experienced two Five-Year Plan periods. The First Five-Year Plan was overfulfilled in 1957. The Second Five-Year Plan, which began in 1958, was basically completed two years ahead of schedule in 1960. From then until now, in the past five years, we comprehensively adjusted the national economy in the first three years, and organized a new upsurge in the national economy in the last two years, preparing sufficient and solid conditions for the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan in all aspects. This is because from 1959 to 1961, we encountered three consecutive years of severe natural disasters; we also made certain shortcomings and mistakes in our work; and the Khrushchev revisionist group, betraying its trust, launched a sudden attack on our country, tearing up hundreds of agreements and contracts, ceasing the supply of important equipment and technical data, and withdrawing all Soviet experts, which further increased our economic difficulties. However, all these serious difficulties did not overwhelm us. Through the efforts of the entire party and the entire people, great difficulties have been transformed into great good.
    In the past few years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we have further learned to use Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought to understand things, analyze situations, grasp problems, and solve problems, and promptly found ways to overcome difficulties, and also found ways to achieve a great leap forward in a certain historical period. We have learned better methods of implementing the mass line, relying on and mobilizing the strength of the broad masses, not only overcoming difficulties, but also promoting a comprehensive upsurge in the national economy. The betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionist group prompted us to make a greater determination to further implement the policy of self-reliance, eliminate dependence and superstition, thereby greatly enhancing the material strength of self-reliance, and finding a correct path and a set of specific methods for carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction that conform to objective laws and Chinese characteristics. We have conscientiously summarized the experiences and lessons in our work, and learned to more comprehensively implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. Facts have fully proved that our experience has become richer and our strength has become stronger.
    It should be particularly pointed out that in the past few years, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching of not forgetting class and class struggle, we have grasped the key of class struggle, launched the socialist education movement in rural and urban areas, and re-educated the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people with the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution to carry the socialist revolution to the end. We have consolidated and expanded the socialist front in political, economic, ideological, and organizational aspects, and combated capitalist evil winds, which greatly boosted the morale of the people throughout the country and greatly enhanced their revolutionary enthusiasm. The struggle against Khrushchev revisionism has greatly raised the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism of the broad masses of cadres and people, which is of profound historical significance for preventing capitalist restoration, promoting the development of our country's socialist cause, and promoting the development of the world revolutionary cause.
    We have further deepened the cultural revolution, and carried out a series of great debates and great reforms in philosophy, historical science, literature and art, education, etc., to publicize Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, criticize revisionism, promote proletarian ideology, and eliminate bourgeois and landlord class ideology. Many social science workers have further understood Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought. Many literary and art workers have further clarified the direction of serving proletarian politics, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the socialist economic base. While further reforming full-time schools, educators have begun to experiment with a part-farming, part-study and part-work, part-study education system. Intellectuals go to the countryside, factories, and companies to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, their thoughts are transformed, and their awareness is greatly improved.
    The people throughout the country are studying Mao Zedong Thought, forming an unprecedented mass upsurge. The broad masses and cadres are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and their awareness has been improved as never before. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the conscious actions of the broad masses of people. Mao Zedong Thought has increasingly become a powerful ideological weapon consciously mastered by millions of people, and a powerful driving force for the development of all tasks. Learning from the People's Liberation Army, learning from Dazhai, and learning from Daqing has spread throughout the country. The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle is taking root, blossoming, and bearing fruit in all walks of life. Learning from Lei Feng, learning from Wang Jie, and learning from all advanced figures has become a self-education movement of the broad masses of people. The revolutionary style of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, the thought of fearing neither hardship nor death, and dedicating oneself wholeheartedly to the revolution has become the new and noble moral style of our society. All these, spirit transforms into matter, promoting the people to make greater contributions to socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    As we begin to implement the magnificent Third Five-Year Plan, our country's material and technical foundation has never been as solid as it is now.
    In the past few years, under the guidance and encouragement of the general line, we have implemented the general policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, and have achieved great achievements.
    Agricultural production has made great progress, achieving good results with continuous increases. The rural people's commune system has been further consolidated, and its superiority has been more fully demonstrated. Farmland water conservancy construction has been effective. On the agricultural front, the glorious banner of Dazhai Brigade has emerged. Rural areas across the country are learning from Dazhai, and many Dazhai-style advanced units have emerged. In 1965, China's agricultural production achieved a good harvest for the fourth consecutive year, and grain, cotton, sugar, flue-cured tobacco, etc. have increased significantly.
    Industrial production has made new progress, and varieties and quality have made new leaps. Many weak links in industry have been greatly strengthened, and many gaps have been filled. In particular, a major breakthrough has been achieved in the development of the petroleum industry, achieving basic self-sufficiency. Transportation has also achieved great success. On the industrial and transportation fronts, the glorious banner of Daqing Oilfield has emerged. Daqing is being studied all over the country, and many Daqing-style advanced enterprises have appeared. In 1965, industrial production had a relatively large increase, increased labor productivity, and reduced costs. Many construction projects have progressed faster, with better construction quality and higher investment effectiveness.
    With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the supply of commodities on the market has been increasing continuously. In 1965, the supply of pork, edible oil, sugar, cotton cloth, etc. increased significantly, prices remained stable, and the market was thriving.
    In the past few years, China's fiscal revenue and expenditure have been balanced, and foreign trade plans have been completed very well. All of China's foreign debts have been paid off, and it has become a country without foreign debts in the world. Domestic public bonds have also been repaid on schedule with principal and interest, and in another two or three years, China will be a country without domestic debts.
    In the past few years, culture, education, health, sports and other undertakings have made great achievements, especially the research work of science and technology has made rapid progress. All departments of the national economy have achieved remarkable achievements in adopting new designs, new technologies, new processes, new materials, and new equipment. The successful explosion of two atomic bombs concentratedly demonstrated that China has made a great leap forward in the struggle to catch up with and surpass the advanced scientific and technological level of the world.
    It is particularly worth pointing out that in the past few years, our people's soldiers—the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Public Security Forces, and the militia—have studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, emphasized politics, adhered to the "Four Firsts," carried forward the "Three-Eight" working style, and have taken a big step forward on the road of revolutionization and modernization, and have achieved major victories in defending the country's airspace, territorial waters, borders, and strengthening social security. Our national defense strength is unprecedentedly strong.
    All these have laid a solid ideological foundation and a strong material foundation for us to implement the Third Five-Year Plan. Our people have never been so energetic and high-spirited. Our country has never been so prosperous.
    1966 is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. We must fight this first battle well and set a good start for the smooth implementation of this magnificent plan.
    In the new year, we must continue to carry out the socialist education movement thoroughly, in batches and in a practical and effective manner. We must continue to comprehensively implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. We must launch a solid and down-to-earth increase production and practice economy movement throughout the country. We must vigorously develop agriculture. The four-level Party committees of provinces, regions, counties, and communes across the country should put agriculture in a primary position, increase grain and cotton production, develop diversified operations, and actively resist disasters and prepare for famine. We must further carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, give full play to the potential of existing industry and transportation, and at the same time adopt the method of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles to accelerate the construction of new projects and put them into production quickly. We must strive to increase the production of raw materials, materials, fuels, electricity, and major electromechanical products, increase products suitable for rural needs, and actively support agriculture. We must rationally organize commodity circulation, improve service quality, and better serve production and the people. We must further shift the focus of culture, education, health and other aspects to the countryside and promote the cultural revolution. We must also strive to strengthen national defense construction, strengthen the People's Liberation Army and the militia.
    We should firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching that we must adopt a "one divides into two" viewpoint towards our work. The smoother our work is, the greater our achievements are, the more we must think about the many difficulties that still exist on our road of progress, and the more we must see the many shortcomings and mistakes in our work. For example, our country's ability to resist natural disasters is not strong, and some areas still suffer from natural disasters every year. In terms of industry, transportation, and capital construction, there are still many weak links. The scientific and technological level of many of our departments is still a considerable distance away from the world's advanced scientific and technological level.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and complacent. Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one lag behind. We should always remember this truth." All localities, all departments, and all units must, in accordance with the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, constantly sum up experience, constantly improve work, and constantly discover, invent, create, and progress.
    Politics is the commander, the soul. Ideological and political work must be placed at the forefront of all work. In order to strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks of 1966, the key lies in strengthening the Party's leadership, emphasizing politics, putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, and promoting the revolutionization of people. Practice has proved that the more we emphasize politics, the higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is raised, the more fully the superiority of the socialist system is brought into play, and the more guaranteed the victory of the cause of revolution and construction is. Grasping revolution and promoting production, grasping revolution and promoting construction is the only way for us to achieve greater achievements.
    In the new year, we must better lead and organize the broad masses of cadres and people to study Chairman Mao's works, especially to focus on the word "use." We must better implement the mass line in all our work, and more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. We must adhere to the good combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, have great enthusiasm, take steady steps, be conscientious and down-to-earth. We must be good at summarizing and promoting the experiences of advanced figures and advanced units, and be good at discovering, supporting, and cultivating constantly emerging new things. We must further launch the mass movement of learning from the People's Liberation Army, learning from Dazhai, and learning from Daqing, and carry forward the fine traditions of self-reliance, hard work, hard struggle, and building the country with diligence and thrift. In this way, we will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill the great tasks of 1966.
    When carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, the people of our country must not forget the class struggle on the international scale at any time. US imperialism sees the increasingly powerful China, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, holds high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, holds high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and firmly supports the revolutionary movements of all countries in the world, as the biggest obstacle to its implementation of its policies of aggression and war, constantly carries out various crazy provocations against China, and wants to have a new contest with China. Many facts show that the focus of the US's counter-revolutionary global strategy is shifting from Europe to Asia. US imperialism is expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and is plotting to impose the war on the Chinese people. We must maintain high vigilance and must put all our work on the basis that US imperialism will fight early and fight big. If the US aggressors dare to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate them.
    US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world. The anti-US struggles of the people of all countries support each other. Our vision must not only be limited to our own country, but also to the whole world. Our production and construction are not only for the needs of the Chinese revolution and to serve the Chinese people, but also for the needs of the world revolution and to serve the people of the world. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "The people who have already won the revolution should assist the struggle of the people who are striving for liberation. This is our internationalist obligation." In order to fulfill this great obligation, we must not spare our own strength and firmly support the Vietnamese people who are at the forefront of the anti-US struggle, firmly support the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and firmly support the people of all countries in the world, and overthrow US imperialism and its running dogs.
    The line of the Khrushchev revisionists is fundamentally opposed to our line. They betray Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, regard US imperialism as their closest friend, dream of realizing US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, and try every means to sell out the revolutionary interests of the people of all countries. We must carry the struggle against Khrushchev revisionism to the end. More than 90% of the people in the world want revolution. We firmly stand with them and will never be isolated. Only a small handful of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, who are in a hostile position to the masses of the people, are isolated and will inevitably become more and more isolated. The US imperialists' policy of isolating China has been going on for sixteen years, and the Khrushchev revisionists' policy of isolating China has also been going on for many years, and the result has been that they are lifting a stone only to drop it on their own feet. China's prestige is getting higher and higher, and China's revolutionary influence is getting greater and greater. Our friends are all over the world.
    We must further unite with the people of the socialist camp, unite with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, unite with the people of all countries in the world, including the American people, and unite with all peace-loving countries and anti-US forces to form a broad international united front and fight to the end to defeat US imperialism and its running dogs.
    In the new year, let us hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, have the motherland in our hearts, have the world in our sights, ride the wind and waves, forge ahead bravely, and strive for new great victories! (with picture)

    迎接第三个五年计划的第一年——一九六六年
    ——元旦献词
    一九六六年到来了！这是我国伟大的第三个五年计划的第一年。我国各族人民，满怀无限的喜悦，决心在这新的一年中争取社会主义革命和社会主义建设更加伟大的成就，使新的五年计划旗开得胜。
    第三个五年计划，是我国人民一个宏伟的发展国民经济计划。在第三个五年计划期间，我们必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，继续深入地展开阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三大革命运动。我们要在农村和城市更加广泛地进行社会主义教育运动；要力争农业生产逐年有所增长，更加有效地贯彻执行《全国农业发展纲要》；要在不断技术革新、不断提高劳动生产率的基础上，充分发挥现有工业企业生产潜力和交通运输业的运载能力，同时大力建设一批新的企业，加强国防建设，加强基础工业，加强交通运输业，进一步改进全国工业的布局，并且相应地发展轻工业，在生产发展的基础上，逐步改善人民生活，建立一个独立的、比较完整的工业体系和国民经济体系。我们要努力争取用二、三十年的时间，赶上和超过世界科学技术的先进水平，把我国建设成为一个具有现代农业、现代工业、现代国防和现代科学技术的社会主义强国。
    我国第三个五年计划，是在我国国民经济出现了全国解放以后从来没有过这样有利的条件下开始的。
    解放以来，在国民经济恢复时期结束以后，我国经历了两个五年计划时期。第一个五年计划，在一九五七年超额完成了。从一九五八年开始的第二个五年计划，到一九六○年就提前两年基本完成了。从那时到现在，在五年的时间里，前三年我们全面调整国民经济，后两年我们组织国民经济新高涨，从各方面为实行第三个五年计划准备了充分的、扎实的条件。这是因为，从一九五九年到一九六一年，我们遇到了连续三年的严重自然灾害；我们在工作中也发生了某些缺点和错误；而赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团又背信弃义，对我国实行突然袭击，撕毁了几百个协定和合同，停止供应重要设备和技术资料，撤走全部苏联专家，更加增加了我们的经济困难。但是，所有这些严重的困难并没有把我们压倒。经过全党全民的努力，大困难已经转化为大好事了。
    在过去几年中，我们在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，进一步学会了运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来认识事物，分析情况，抓住问题，解决问题，及时地找到了克服困难的途径，也找到了在一定历史时期内实现大跃进的途径。我们学会了更好地贯彻实行群众路线的方法，依靠和动员广大群众的力量，不仅战胜了困难，而且促进了国民经济的全面高涨。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的背叛，促使我们下更大的决心，进一步实行自力更生的方针，破除依赖和迷信思想，从而大大增强了自力更生的物质力量，并且找到了符合客观规律和中国特点的进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的正确道路和一套具体办法。我们认真地总结了工作中的经验教训，学会了更加全面地贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。事实已经完全证明，我们的经验更加丰富了，我们的力量更加强大了。
    特别应当指出的是，在过去几年中，我们根据毛泽东同志关于不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争的教导，抓住了阶级斗争这个纲，在农村和城市展开了社会主义教育运动，用把社会主义革命进行到底的不断革命和彻底革命的精神重新教育广大党员、干部和群众。我们在政治、经济、思想和组织方面，巩固和扩大社会主义阵地，打击资本主义歪风，使全国人民的精神面貌大为振奋，革命积极性大为高涨。反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争，大大提高了广大干部和人民群众的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的思想水平，这对于防止资本主义复辟，推进我国的社会主义事业的发展，推进世界革命事业的发展，都具有深远的历史意义。
    我们更加深入地展开文化革命，在哲学、历史科学、文学艺术、教育等方面，进行了一系列的大辩论和大改革，宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，批判修正主义，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想和地主阶级思想。许多社会科学工作者，进一步领会了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。许多文艺工作者进一步明确了为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务、为社会主义经济基础服务的方向。教育工作者在进一步改革全日制学校的同时，开始试办半农半读、半工半读的教育制度。知识分子下乡、下厂、下连队，同工农兵结合，思想得到改造，觉悟大为提高。
    全国人民学习毛泽东思想，形成前所未有的群众性的热潮。广大的群众和干部，活学活用毛主席的著作，觉悟空前提高。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，已成为广大人民的自觉行动。毛泽东思想已经日益成为千百万群众自觉掌握的强大的思想武器，成为各项工作向前发展的强大动力。学解放军，学大寨，学大庆，遍及全国。自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，正在各行各业中生根、开花、结果。学雷锋，学王杰，学一切先进人物，成为广大人民群众的自我教育运动。毫不利己、专门利人的革命风格，一不怕苦、二不怕死、一心为革命的思想，成为我们社会的新的崇高的道德风尚。所有这些，精神变物质，促进了人民群众为社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    在我们开始执行宏伟的第三个五年计划的时候，我国的物质技术基础从来没有象现在这样雄厚。
    几年来，我们在总路线的指引和鼓舞下，贯彻执行了以农业为基础、以工业为主导的发展国民经济的总方针，取得了伟大的成就。
    农业生产有了很大的发展，取得了连续增产的好成绩。农村人民公社制度更加巩固，它的优越性得到了更加充分的发挥。农田水利建设卓有成效。在农业战线上，出现了大寨大队这面光辉的旗帜。全国各地农村大学大寨，出现了许多大寨式的先进单位。一九六五年，我国农业生产获得连续第四年的好收成，粮食、棉花、糖料、烤烟等又有了较多的增产。
    工业生产有了新的发展，品种、质量有了新的跃进。工业上的许多薄弱环节大大加强了，许多缺门补齐了。特别是在石油工业的发展方面，实现了一个重大的突破，达到了基本自给。交通运输也取得了很大成绩。在工业、交通战线上出现了大庆油田这面光辉的旗帜。全国各地大学大庆，出现了许多大庆式的先进企业。一九六五年，工业生产有了较大幅度的增长，提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本。许多建设工程进度较快，施工质量较好，投资效果较高。
    随着工农业生产的发展，市场商品供应量不断增加。一九六五年，猪肉、食油、糖、棉布等供应量增长很多，物价继续稳定，市场一片兴旺。
    几年来，我国财政收支平衡，对外贸易计划完成得很好。我国的所有外债已经全部还清，已经成为世界上一个没有外债的国家。国内公债也如期偿还本息，再过两三年以后，我国又将是一个没有内债的国家。
    几年来，文化、教育、卫生、体育等事业都有很大成绩，特别是科学技术的研究工作有了突飞猛进的发展。国民经济各部门在采用新设计、新技术、新工艺、新材料、新设备方面，都得到了显著的成就。两颗原子弹的爆炸成功，集中地表现了我国在争取赶上和超过世界先进科学技术水平的斗争中，大大地跃进了一步。
    特别值得指出的是，几年来，我们的人民子弟兵——中国人民解放军、公安部队和民兵，活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，在革命化和现代化的道路上迈进了一大步，在捍卫祖国的领空、领海、边疆和加强社会治安方面取得了重大的胜利。我国的国防力量空前强大。
    所有这些，都为我们实行第三个五年计划，奠定了坚实的思想基础和强大的物质基础。我们的人民从来没有现在这样的意气风发，斗志昂扬。我们的国家，从来没有现在这样的欣欣向荣。
    一九六六年是第三个五年计划的第一年。我们必须打好这第一仗，为顺利地实现这个宏伟的计划树立一个良好的开端。
    在新的一年里，我们要继续分期分批地、切实有效地把社会主义教育运动贯彻到底。我们要继续全面贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省的社会主义建设总路线。我们要在全国范围内扎扎实实地开展一个增产节约运动。我们要大力发展农业。全国各省、地、县、社四级党委要把农业放在首要地位，增产粮棉，发展多种经营，积极抗灾备荒。我们要进一步开展技术革新和技术革命，充分发挥现有工业和交通运输业的潜力，同时采取集中力量打歼灭战的方法，加快新建工程的建设，使之迅速投入生产。我们要努力增产原料、材料、燃料、电力和主要机电产品，要增加适合农村需要的产品，积极支援农业。我们要合理组织商品流通，提高服务质量，更好地为生产服务、为人民服务。我们要进一步把文化、教育、卫生等方面工作的重点转向农村，推进文化革命。我们还必须努力加强国防建设，加强人民解放军和民兵。
    我们应当牢牢记住毛泽东同志的教导，对待我们的工作必须采取一分为二的观点。我们的工作越是顺利，我们的成就越大，越要想到在我们前进的道路上还有不少困难，越要看到我们的工作中还有不少缺点和错误。例如，我国农业抵抗自然灾害的能力还不强，每年总还有部分地区遭受自然灾害。在工业、交通、基本建设方面，还有不少薄弱环节。我们不少部门的科学技术水平，比起世界先进的科学技术水平，还有一段相当大的距离。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”各个地方，各个部门，各个单位，都要根据党中央和毛泽东同志的教导，不断地总结经验，不断地改进工作，不断地有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。思想政治工作必须摆在一切工作的首位。为了争取完成和超额完成一九六六年的任务，关键在于加强党的领导，突出政治，毛泽东思想挂帅，促进人的革命化。实践已经证明，越是突出政治，毛泽东思想红旗举得越高，社会主义制度的优越性就发挥得越充分，革命和建设事业的胜利就越有保证。抓革命、促生产，抓革命、促建设，这是我们取得更大成就的必由之路。
    在新的一年里，我们必须更好地领导和组织广大干部和群众学习毛主席著作，特别是要在“用”字上下功夫。我们在各项工作中要更好地贯彻群众路线，要更加充分地调动各方面的积极性。我们要坚持把革命精神和科学态度很好地结合起来，干劲要大，步子要稳，兢兢业业，踏踏实实。我们要善于总结和推广先进人物、先进单位的经验，善于发现、支持和培养不断出现的新事物。我们必须进一步展开学解放军、学大寨、学大庆的比学赶帮超群众运动，把自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的优良传统发扬光大。这样，我们就一定能够完成和超额完成一九六六年的伟大任务。
    我国人民在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的时候，时刻不能忘记国际范围的阶级斗争。美帝国主义把高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，高举毛泽东思想旗帜，高举无产阶级国际主义旗帜，坚决支持世界各国革命运动和日益强大的中国，看成是它推行侵略政策和战争政策的最大障碍，不断对中国进行各种疯狂的挑衅，并且想要同中国作一次新的较量。许多事实表明，美国的反革命全球战略重点，正在从欧洲转移到亚洲。美帝国主义正在扩大侵略越南的战争，而且策划着把战争强加在中国人民头上。我们必须保持高度警惕，必须把一切工作放在美帝国主义要早打、要大打这个基础上。如果美国侵略者胆敢来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭它。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人。各国人民的反美斗争是相互支持的。我们的眼光绝不能只看到本国，而要看到全世界。我们进行生产建设，不仅为了中国革命的需要，为中国人民服务，也是为了世界革命的需要，为全世界人民服务。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”为了履行这个伟大义务，我们必须毫不吝惜自己的力量，坚定地支援处在反美斗争最前线的越南人民，坚定地支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，坚定地支援全世界各国人民，打倒美帝国主义及其走狗。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的路线同我们的路线是根本对立的。他们背叛马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，把美帝国主义当作是自己最亲密的朋友，梦想实现美苏合作主宰世界，千方百计地要出卖世界各国人民的革命利益。我们必须把反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争进行到底。世界上百分之九十以上的人是要革命的。我们坚定地同他们站在一起，永远不会孤立。只有一小撮帝国主义者、修正主义者和反动派，他们同人民大众处于敌对的地位，才是孤立的，而且必定越来越孤立。美帝国主义孤立中国的政策搞了十六年，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者孤立中国的政策也搞了好多年，结果都是搬起石头打自己的脚。中国的威望越来越高，中国的革命影响越来越大。我们的朋友遍于全世界。
    我们要进一步同社会主义阵营各国人民团结起来，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民团结起来，同包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民团结起来，同所有爱好和平的国家和反美力量团结起来，组成广泛的国际统一战线，为打败美帝国主义及其走狗而斗争到底。
    让我们在新的一年中，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，乘风破浪，勇往直前，争取新的伟大胜利！（附图片）
