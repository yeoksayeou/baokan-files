    Zhejiang Province, one of the main tung oil producing areas in China, had a substantial increase in tung oil seed production last year. In the main producing areas of Chun'an and Jiande, production more than doubled compared to the previous year.
    The tung oil produced in Zhejiang has a bright, light yellow color and good quality, and has always been popular in domestic and foreign markets. In recent years, the area of tung tree forests has increased rapidly. In counties such as Chun'an and Jiande, the area of tung tree forests has more than tripled in recent years. Various regions have also strengthened the cultivation and management of existing tung forests, so the yield and quality of tung oil seeds have been significantly improved.

    浙江所产桐油，色泽淡黄鲜明，质量较好，历来受国内外市场欢迎。近年来，桐林面积增加很快。淳安、建德等县近几年桐林面积扩大了三倍多。各地对原有桐林也加强了培育管理，因此，油桐籽的产量和质量都有了显著提高。
