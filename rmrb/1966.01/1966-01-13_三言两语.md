    Recently, American invading forces launched a large-scale attack on the "Iron Triangle" liberation area northwest of Saigon, and boasted about it as a "sweeping operation." However, according to an Associated Press reporter accompanying the troops, some American officers "felt disappointed" with this operation, complaining that they had been "fooled by the enemy" and were "helpless," because they could not find the "main force of the Viet Cong," and "snipers were playing a game of hide-and-seek," "killing one Allied soldier after another."
    It is certain that in the face of the people's warriors who successfully use the guerrilla tactics of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue," these guys will forever be "fooled," forever feel "disappointed" and "helpless," because they will never be able to deal with people's guerrilla warfare.

    It is said that the South Vietnamese puppet army has been repeatedly severely criticized by American "advisors" due to the failure of the "mopping-up" operation in the "Iron Triangle." This time, the US military personally dispatched troops, and carefully arranged a "clever" plan of action in advance, deploying very secretly, attempting a "sweeping" demonstration of power. However, in the words of the Associated Press, "the results were no better than those of similar operations frequently organized by the Vietnamese in the past," and therefore they also received "the same criticism."
    The American invading forces in Vietnam blame the South Vietnamese puppet army for being useless, but in fact they are even more useless. Is this a case of "the fifty paces laughing at the hundred paces," or "the hundred paces laughing at the fifty paces"?

    三言两语
    最近，美国侵略军大举进犯西贡西北“铁三角”解放区，并且吹嘘为“席卷行动”。然而，据美联社随军记者报道，一些美军军官对这次行动却“感到失望”，抱怨“上了敌人的当”，“对此毫无办法”，因为找不到“越共主力”，“狙击手们在玩捉迷藏的把戏”，“他们打死了一个又一个的盟军”。
    可以肯定，在成功地运用“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的游击战术的人民战士面前，这些家伙永远会“上当”，永远会感到“失望”和“毫无办法”，因为他们永远也对付不了人民游击战争。

    据说，南越伪军由于在“铁三角”进行“扫荡”失败，而一再受到美国“顾问”的严厉批评。这次美军亲自出动，而且事先安排好“巧妙”的行动计划，部署十分秘密，企图“席卷”一下，显显威风。但是，用美联社的话来说，“结果并不比越南人过去经常组织的、规模相似的行动的结果好一些”，因此也受到“同样的批评”。
    侵越美军责怪南越伪军不中用，其实自己更不中用。这究竟是“五十步笑百步”呢，还是“百步笑五十步”呢？
