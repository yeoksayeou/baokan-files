    Brief Comments
    In the Mekong Delta, the invading American troops are frantically implementing a "scorched earth policy," instructing paratroopers to "burn and destroy anything that can be eaten and any place that can be lived in." An American military officer in charge of carrying out this inhuman "mission" said: "If we keep them busy rebuilding their houses and replanting their crops, then they probably won't have time to shoot."
    Their scheme can be described as vicious. But how foolish it is. Invaders always think that using brutal means such as a scorched earth policy can force the invaded to submit. In fact, doing so will only arouse greater hatred from the invaded people. They will find that the South Vietnamese people will not only have time to shoot, but will also fire more revenge bullets to punish the American invaders.

    What kind of secret collusion Harriman and Sato were engaging in during their talks was already very clear. Now, according to a report by the Japanese Kyodo News, Sato stated that he would work hard to peddle the American peace talk fraud and decided to send the Foreign Minister to the Soviet Union to carry out activities. Thus, the truth is even more obvious.
    However, the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary still wants to cover it up, saying that Sato's talks with Harriman were "an important meeting" but "cannot disclose the details." Obviously, if their collusion was not too dirty, too stinky, and too shameful to be seen, why would they deliberately mystify things like this?

    When commenting on the Johnson administration's manipulation of both war and "peace talks" strategies, the British *Times* put on a fair face, saying that "if its methods can sometimes be criticized, its purpose cannot be."
    Everyone knows that Johnson's insidious means of playing counter-revolutionary dual tactics are aimed at achieving the aggressive goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam. What is the *Times* pretending not to understand? Obviously, the *Times* is using this tactic of minor criticism to achieve the purpose of giving Johnson a big help. Therefore, both the means and the purpose of the *Times* should be criticized.

    三言两语
    侵越美军在湄公河三角洲疯狂地实行“焦土政策”，指令伞兵“把能吃的东西和能住的地方都烧掉毁掉”。一名负责执行这项灭绝人性的“任务”的美军军官说：“如果我们使他们忙于重建他们的房子和重新种庄稼，那么他们大概就没有时间射击”。
    其计可谓毒矣。但是，这是何其蠢哉。侵略者总是认为用焦土政策一类的残暴手段可以迫使被侵略者屈服，事实上他们这样做只能激起被侵略的人民更大的仇恨。他们将会发现，南越人民不但不会没有时间射击，而且必将发出更多复仇的子弹来惩罚美国侵略者。

    哈里曼同佐藤的会谈，究竟是在进行什么样的秘密勾结，本来是很清楚的。现在，据日本共同社报道，佐藤表示要为兜售美国和谈骗局卖力，并决定派外务相去苏联进行活动，这样，真相就更是大白于天下了。
    可是，日本内阁官房长官却还要遮盖一番，说佐藤同哈里曼的会谈“是一次重要的会谈”，但“不能奉告详细内容”。显然，如果他们的勾结不是太脏，太臭，见不得人，那又何必如此故弄玄虚呢？

    英国《泰晤士报》评论约翰逊政府玩弄战争与“和谈”两手策略时，摆出一副公正的脸孔，说什么“如果说对它的手段有时可以加以批评，对它的目的却不能如此”。
    谁都知道，约翰逊玩弄反革命两手的阴谋手段，乃是为了达到永久霸占南越的侵略目的。《泰晤士报》装什么糊涂？很显然，《泰晤士报》使出这种小批评的手段，是为了达到给约翰逊大帮忙的目的。因此，《泰晤士报》的手段和目的都应当受到批评。
