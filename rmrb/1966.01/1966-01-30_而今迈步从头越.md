    "Now We Start Afresh"
    We are determined to listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the path guided by the Party, give prominence to politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be thorough revolutionaries, and be Mao Zedong's literary and artistic soldiers.
    Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers through literature and art, and the integration of literary and artistic workers with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, is the core of Mao Zedong Thought in literature and art. Whether or not to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and whether or not to be willing to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, is a question of whether or not a literary and artistic worker is revolutionary. It is also the focus of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the literary and artistic front, the distinction between socialism and capitalism, and the divergence between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism.
    As professional literary and artistic workers, we actively respond to the Party's call and follow Chairman Mao's teachings, enthusiastically going among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, participating in labor, participating in struggle, and delivering socialist revolutionary culture to the countryside, factories, and troops. We listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the path guided by the Party, are tempered and transformed in the crucible of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, taste the sweetness, and achieve preliminary results on the road of revolutionization and laborization.
    In the past year, a group of comrades from the theater spent more than eight months in rural areas. Some of them lived, ate, and worked alongside poor and lower-middle peasants, participating in actual struggles. Some formed rural cultural work teams three times, going deep into Baiyangdian in Hebei Province and the mountainous areas of Funing to carry out rural cultural activities. Through these activities, the education we received from the poor and lower-middle peasants was extremely profound. Some comrades said: Farmers use the grain obtained from their hard labor to feed us, but we rarely serve them! Some comrades said: Whether or not to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants is a question of class line! In short, who to serve, how to serve, and what to "serve" with have become topics for consideration, and the rural cultural work team went down with these questions in mind.
    Through labor, we made "labor friends," through labor, we generated a strong desire to create and praise heroic people, and through labor, we had concrete and full emotions when singing. Chairman Mao said in "Introducing a Cooperative": "Never before have the masses of the people been so spiritually uplifted, so high in morale, and so full of vigor." Facing these masters of the era, we must change, and if we do not wholeheartedly serve them, what can we say about "actor cultivation"? What can we say about "actor morality"? Any individualistic excuse cannot hide the ugliness of fame and fortune! Re-opening Chairman Mao's works: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous," we have a deeper understanding.
    The ridges and construction sites are both stages and classrooms. We write while singing, and perform while writing. Writing about heroes is educated by countless ordinary and great heroic deeds, and singing about heroes will make ourselves receive direct education. When your singing has not yet ended, the shouts shake the sky, and the numbers here are the determination: "Sixty-day project completed in twenty days!", "Two-term task completed in one term!" When you see the leap from spirit to matter with your own eyes, the effect of art serving production, when you hear the political commissar of the construction site say: "You have played a role that the barrel of a gun cannot play," then you will have a personal understanding of literature and art serving proletarian politics and serving the socialist economic base.
    The rural cultural work team went deep into the mountainous areas of Funing, Hebei, and in order to deliver socialist culture to the mountains where no one had ever seen a play, they formed a fourteen-member team. Donkeys carried simple props, stepping on the chaotic stone riverbeds, crossing mountains and ridges, active on the Great Wall line. The team members often encouraged each other with "He who does not reach the Great Wall is not a true man," and "Infinite scenery is at the dangerous peak." The commune members ran to tell each other, dressed in new clothes to greet guests, ran to the mouth of the ditch several miles away to greet us, and kindly called us: "The comfort group sent by Chairman Mao."
    The high ground of the fields, the corner of the terraced fields, is the stage, and sometimes the performance starts on the radish cellar. When Xi'er appeared in the opera "The White-Haired Girl," snowflakes really fell from the sky. After Yang Bailao was forced to death by the landlord, he lay in the snow. Xi'er was dragged away by the landlord. The characters on the stage cried for help, the audience under the stage cried, and the band on the side of the stage shed tears. At this time, the relationship between the actors and the audience became a joint accusation against the cannibalistic old society and the evil landlord class. After the end of the performance, a poor peasant commune member walked through the backstage and sobbed, saying: "Class hatred can never be forgotten!" Carrying the child and walking against the mountain breeze... the actors wiped away their tears and removed their makeup, some covering their faces and sobbing, and everyone's chest was impacted by the class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants... Our feelings have never been so close to the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    The progress initially gained by the team members this year mainly relied on two points: one is to vigorously grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, and the other is to vigorously grasp the real in-depth study. Repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," learning below is different from past learning, and there are new understandings in many aspects. In particular, combined with personal thoughts and the direction of the unit to learn, the more you learn, the clearer you become, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the work will be victorious, otherwise, the work will surely fail.
    In the new year, the theater has made plans to divide its troops into two routes and rush to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao told us: "The countryside is a vast world where there is much to be done." "The majestic pass is really like iron, but now we step forward from the beginning," we are determined to listen to Chairman Mao's words, give prominence to politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be thorough revolutionaries, be Mao Zedong's literary and artistic soldiers, and keep moving forward on the road of self-transformation!

    “而今迈步从头越”
    我们决心听毛主席的话，走党指引的路，突出政治，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，做彻底的革命者，做毛泽东的文艺兵
    文艺为工农兵服务，文艺工作者同工农兵相结合，这是毛泽东思想在文艺方面的核心。为不为工农兵服务，愿不愿与工农兵结合，是文艺工作者革命不革命的问题，也是文艺战线上无产阶级同资产阶级斗争的焦点，社会主义同资本主义的区别，马克思列宁主义同修正主义的分歧。
    作为专业的文艺工作者，我们积极响应党的号召，遵循着毛主席的教导，热情地到工农兵中间去，参加劳动，参加斗争，把社会主义革命文化送到农村、工厂和部队。我们听毛主席的话，走党指引的路，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命的熔炉里，受到锻炼，得到改造，尝到甜头，在革命化、劳动化的道路上，取得了初步的成果。
    过去的一年中，剧院有一批同志，八个多月在农村活动。其中有的与贫下中农“三同”，参加实际斗争。有的前后三次组成农村文化工作队，深入河北省白洋淀和抚宁山区，开展农村文化活动。通过这些活动，贫下中农给我们的教育是极其深刻的。有的同志讲：农民用他们辛勤的劳动获得的粮食养活我们，而我们却很少为他们服务！有的同志说：为不为贫下中农服务是阶级路线问题！总之，为谁服务，怎样服务，用什么“为”，成了思考的课题，农村文化工作队也正是带着这些问题下去的。
    通过劳动交了“劳动朋友”，通过劳动产生了强烈的歌颂英雄人民的创作愿望，通过劳动演唱时有了具体而充沛的感情。毛主席在《介绍一个合作社》里讲：“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”我们面对着这些时代的主人，不变也得变，不全心全意地为他们服务，谈什么“演员修养”？讲什么“演员道德”？任何个人主义的借口都遮不住名利思想的丑恶！再翻开毛主席著作：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，就体会得更深一步了。
    田埂，工地，是舞台也是课堂，边写边唱，边演边写，写英雄则无数平凡而伟大的英雄事迹教育我们，唱英雄会使自己受到直接的教育。当你的歌声未落，呼声震天，数字在这里就是决心：“六十天工程二十天完成！”，“两期任务一期完成！”当你亲眼看到了精神变物质的飞跃，艺术为生产服务的功效，当你听到工地的政委说：“你们起到了枪杆子起不到的作用。”那时，对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义经济基础服务，就有切身体会了。
    农村文化工作队深入河北抚宁山区，为了把社会主义文化送到从未看过戏的山里，组成十四人的小队，毛驴驮着简单的道具，踏着乱石河道，翻山越岭，活跃在长城线上。队员们常用“不到长城非好汉”，“无限风光在险峰”互相鼓动。社员们奔走相告，穿新待客，跑到几里外的沟口来迎接，并亲切地把我们称作：“毛主席派来的慰问团”。
    地头的高处，梯田的一角，就是舞台，有时演出在萝卜窖上开始。当歌剧《白毛女》中喜儿出场时，雪花真的从天降下，杨白劳被地主逼死后就躺在雪地里，喜儿被地主拉走了，台上的角色呼救，台下的观众哭泣，台侧的乐队流泪。这时演员和观众的关系，变成了共同向吃人的旧社会和万恶的地主阶级进行控诉。散场时一位贫农社员走过后台泣不成声地说：“阶级仇啥时候也不能忘呵！”背着孩子迎着山风走去……演员们挥泪卸装，有的掩面呜咽，每个人的胸怀里被贫下中农的阶级感情冲击着……。我们的感情从没有这样和贫下中农的感情接近过。
    队员在这一年里初步获得的进步，主要靠了两点：一是大抓毛主席著作的学习，一是大抓真正的深入下去。反复数次学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》一文，在下边学和过去的学习不同，许多方面有了新的认识。特别是结合着个人的思想，单位的方向去学习，越学越清楚了，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，工作就取得胜利，反之，工作必遭失败。
    剧院在新的一年里，已作好兵分两路，齐奔工农兵的计划。毛主席告诉我们：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”“雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越”，我们决心听毛主席的话，突出政治，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，作彻底的革命者，作毛泽东的文艺兵，在自我改造的道路上不停地前进！
