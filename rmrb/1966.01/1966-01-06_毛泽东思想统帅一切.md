    Since Comrade Mao Zedong issued the great call to launch a mass design revolution movement, it has been enthusiastically responded to by design personnel across the country, transforming into a tremendous force that promotes the rapid and economical development of industrial production and construction in our country.
    Today, the People's Daily publishes Comrade Shen Hong's article, "Product Design Revolution Must Take Mao Zedong Thought as a Guide," which provides a summary of the newspaper's five-month discussion on product design revolution. The product design revolution movement, together with the basic construction design revolution movement, has converged into a revolutionary torrent, washing away the impurities in design thinking and liberating the minds of our vast design personnel. “Blind faith in foreigners,” distrust of oneself; blind faith in “highly educated people,” distrust of workers, peasants, and soldiers; blind faith in "things," distrust of people; blind faith in "expensive" (the more money spent, the better), distrust of the ability to accomplish more with less money... All such bourgeois, metaphysical, subjective, and inaction-oriented views have been criticized. Gradually, a design philosophy guided by Mao Zedong Thought and in line with the General Line's requirements has been established in design work. A design philosophy led by Mao Zedong Thought is revolutionary, scientific, materialist-dialectical, combines theory with practice, and integrates leaders, designers, and workers.
    Design means finding solutions. How to build our country's industry on advanced scientific and technological levels, how to equip our factories with the latest equipment, how to manufacture new products that meet the needs of national economic development and people's lives—this is a decisive step in whether our country can catch up with and surpass advanced world levels, and whether we can build a modern, powerful socialist country in two or three decades. Without advanced design, there can be no factories and products of advanced levels. To catch up with and surpass international advanced levels, design thinking must first catch up with and surpass international advanced levels.
    Correct design is the greatest increase in production and thrift; incorrect design will inevitably cause huge waste. For the same project or product, if the design is correct, it can be done well, achieving quality, quantity, speed, and economy; if the design is wrong, it will be done slowly, poorly, wastefully, and will bring serious bad consequences.
    Today, the People's Daily publishes the Beijing South Moat dredging project. Due to the modification of unreasonable designs, more than 400 mu of cultivated land were saved, and more than 1,000 mu of low-lying land were filled into fertile fields. The design of a highway, however, lacked a mass perspective and occupied half of a village's farmland, causing great dissatisfaction among the peasants. It can be seen that design work is by no means merely a scientific and technological endeavor. From its main aspect, it should be said to be a work of extremely serious political nature.
    Is advanced design mainly determined by technology and knowledge? No. Technology and knowledge must be seen as serving which class. When technology and knowledge are in the hands of imperialism and the bourgeoisie, they become tools for them to maintain reactionary rule, carry out aggression, and carry out exploitation. When they are in the hands of the proletariat and the revolutionary people, they become weapons for transforming the old world and creating a new world. Therefore, technology and knowledge do not determine everything. The factor that truly determines everything is people, is politics.
    Are we emphasizing the human factor "voluntarism"? No. That kind of statement is a slander against us by modern revisionists, not worthy of refutation. What are people? People are also matter. What distinguishes them from ordinary matter is that people have matter that can think—brains. Comrade Mao Zedong told us that thoughts, principles, opinions, plans, policies, etc., are subjective things. Doing or acting is the subjective manifested in objective things, all of which are unique human agency. This agency, we call "conscious agency," is the characteristic that distinguishes people from things.
    People of different classes have different thoughts. When people have proletarian thought, have Marxism-Leninism, have Mao Zedong Thought, they can fully develop subjective initiative, constantly sum up experience from the practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment, transform matter into spirit, and then put these thoughts, correctly generalized from objective facts, into action, transforming spirit into matter. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: “People’s social existence determines people’s thinking. And correct ideas representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, become a material force for transforming society and transforming the world.” The great achievements of our country's design revolution movement are a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is infinitely powerful; Mao Zedong Thought commands everything.
    All ambitious revolutionary design workers must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further develop the design revolution movement, and strive to make our country's industrial scientific and technological level catch up with and surpass advanced world levels, and build our country into a modern socialist power as soon as possible!

### 毛泽东思想统帅一切

    毛泽东思想统帅一切
    毛泽东同志发出开展群众性的设计革命运动的伟大号召以来，得到全国设计人员的热烈响应，化为巨大的力量，促进我国工业生产和建设多快好省地发展。
    今天本报发表的沈鸿同志《产品设计革命必须以毛泽东思想为指针》的文章，为本报五个月来关于产品设计革命的讨论，作了一个总结。产品设计革命运动，同基本建设设计革命运动，汇成一股革命巨流，荡涤着设计思想中的污浊，使我国广大设计人员的思想获得大解放。“迷信洋人”，不相信自己；迷信“大学问人”，不相信工农兵；迷信“物”，不相信人；迷信“贵”（花钱越多的越好），不相信少花钱可以多办事，……凡此种种资产阶级的、形而上学的、主观主义的、无所作为的观点，受到了批判；在设计工作中逐步树立起以毛泽东思想为指针的、符合总路线要求的设计思想。毛泽东思想挂帅的设计思想，是革命的，科学的，唯物辩证法的，理论与实际相结合的，领导、设计人员和工人三结合的。
    设计就是想办法。怎样把我国的工业建筑在先进的科学技术水平之上，怎样用最新的设备来装备我国的工厂，怎样制造出适应国民经济发展和人民生活需要的新产品，这是关系我国能不能赶上和超过世界先进水平，能不能在二三十年内建成一个社会主义的现代化强国的有决定意义的一步。没有先进的设计，就不可能有先进水平的工厂和产品。要赶上和超过国际先进水平，首先是设计思想要赶上和超过国际先进水平。
    正确的设计，是最大的增产节约；错误的设计，必然造成巨大的浪费。同样的工程、产品，设计正确了，可以搞得好字当头，又好又多又快又省；设计错误了，就会搞得少慢差费，就会带来严重的恶果。
    今天本报刊登的北京南护城河的疏浚工程，由于修改了不合理的设计，少占四百多亩耕地，并且把一千多亩洼地垫成良田；一条公路的设计，由于缺乏群众观点，却占了一个村庄的一半农田，农民很有意见。可见，设计工作绝不仅仅是一种科学技术工作，从它的主要方面看，应当说是一种具有十分严肃的政治性的工作。
    先进的设计主要决定于技术和知识吗？不对。技术和知识要看是为那一个阶级服务的。技术和知识掌握在帝国主义和资产阶级手里，就成为它们维持反动统治，进行侵略，进行剥削的工具；掌握在无产阶级、革命人民手里，就成为改造旧世界，创造新世界的武器。所以说，技术和知识决定不了一切，真正决定一切的因素是人，是政治。
    我们强调人的因素，是“唯意志论”吗？不是。那种说法，是不值一驳的现代修正主义者对我们的诬蔑。人是什么？人也是物质，所不同于一般物质的，是人有能够想问题的物质——头脑。毛泽东同志告诉我们，思想、道理、意见、计划、方针等等，是主观的东西，做或行动是主观见之于客观的东西，都是人类特殊的能动性。这种能动性，我们名之曰“自觉的能动性”，是人之所以区别于物的特点。
    不同阶级的人有不同的思想。人有了无产阶级思想，有了马克思列宁主义，有了毛泽东思想，就能够充分发挥主观能动性，从生产斗争、阶级斗争、科学实验的实践中，不断总结经验，把物质变精神；再把这些从客观事实中正确地概括出来的思想，见之于行动，使精神变物质。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我国设计革命运动的巨大成就，是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想威力无穷，毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    一切有志气的革命的设计工作人员，要努力学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来。让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进一步开展设计革命运动，为我国工业的科学技术水平赶上和超过世界先进水平，早日把我国建设成为一个现代化的社会主义强国而奋斗！
