    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou – The Fujian Provincial People's Spring Festival慰问团 (Comfort Group) held a grand comfort meeting in Fuzhou on the 3rd to warmly慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) the frontline Army, Navy, Air Force, and Public Security Forces.

    Wei Jinshui, head of the Comfort Group, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, and Governor of Fujian Province, delivered a comfort speech at the meeting. He extended warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all commanders and fighters of the frontline troops on behalf of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and the people of the entire province. He praised the frontline troops for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and achieving significant victories in the past year in the struggle against the enemy, combat readiness training, helping with militia building, safeguarding internal security, and participating in socialist revolution and socialist construction. After introducing the new achievements made by the people of Fujian Province in various fronts such as industry, agriculture, culture, education, and health in the past year, he said: This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of the arduous struggle of the people of the whole province, and it is inseparable from your protection and support.

    Wei Jinshui said: This year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. We must redouble our efforts and, while strengthening socialist construction, be a hundred times more vigilant, do a good job in war preparedness, further implement Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, implement全民皆兵 (everyone a soldier), and build the thousand-mile coastline into an impregnable wall of bronze. He expressed that the people of Fujian are determined to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production and various tasks, support the frontline with practical actions, resolutely support whatever the troops need, and support them wherever they are needed. If U.S. imperialism and its running dogs dare to invade, we will drown them in the vast ocean of people's war.

    Zhan Huayu, the person in charge of the Fujian Frontline Troops, expressed his gratitude to the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and people from all walks of life on behalf of all commanders and fighters. He reported on the achievements of the frontline troops in the past year in emphasizing politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, adhering to the four firsts, vigorously promoting the three-eight work style, promoting the three major democracies, and deeply carrying out the four-good company movement. He said: These achievements are due to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the Military Commission, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and to the strong support given by the people of the whole country, especially the people of Fujian who have a glorious revolutionary tradition. He asked all commanders and fighters of the frontline troops to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the five principles for continuing to emphasize politics put forward by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, further strengthen combat readiness, humbly learn from the local areas, strengthen army-people unity, and be ready to wipe out any enemy that dares to invade at any time.

    More than 1,300 people, including members of the Comfort Group and representatives of the troops, attended the comfort meeting.

    The Fujian Provincial People's Spring Festival Comfort Group was established last December and includes a general group and nine sub-groups composed of various special districts (cities). Now, these sub-groups have arrived at the forefront positions, wharves, airports, etc., to widely展开 (unfold) comfort activities.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha – A large number of demobilized and retired soldiers in Hunan Province have made contributions on various fronts. According to statistics from relevant departments, more than 3,000 demobilized and retired soldiers in 26 counties and cities have been rated as labor models of the county and city, more than 500 have been elected as representatives of people's congresses at all levels, and many have been rated as activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, five-good commune members or advanced producers.

    Among this group of demobilized and retired soldiers, there are old Red Army soldiers and old Eighth Route Army soldiers who have fought for half their lives, heroes and models who have made meritorious service in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and a large number of five-good soldiers who have emerged in recent years. Wherever this batch of revolutionary seeds is sown, they bring the good traditions and work styles of the People's Army. In the recent year, in areas where the socialist education movement has been carried out, they have undergone new training and testing, and a large number of activists have emerged in the movement. Many people have been elected by the masses as grassroots cadres. Among the 106 demobilized and retired soldiers of the Quanmin Commune in Ningxiang County, 96 were elected as cadres of production brigades and production teams, or held other positions because of their firm stand, clear distinction between right and wrong, and active work in the movement, which were deeply trusted by the masses. Many demobilized and retired soldiers play a leading role in agricultural production. Bai Fangmiao, a national people's congress representative and old Red Army soldier from the Shiping Brigade of the Zaoshi Commune in Shimen County, carried 100 kilograms of cotton cake back and forth for 120 miles three times to exchange good cotton seeds for the production team in order to increase cotton production and sell more good cotton to the state, which was praised by the commune members. These demobilized and retired soldiers, with a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, actively participated in the militia organization and carried out various activities. Among the 125 demobilized and retired soldiers in the Henglongqiao Commune in Yiyang County, 92 are militia cadres. They led the militia to study Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and actively carry out military training activities. The militia work in the entire commune is very active and has become an advanced unit in the entire special district.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an – The families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers in Shaanxi Province regard Chairman Mao's instruction of "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" as their guide to action, work actively on various fronts, and have produced many advanced figures. According to incomplete statistics from 40 counties and cities such as Pucheng, Xunyang, and Ganquan, nearly 10,000 families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers were rated as activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, five-good commune members, five-good militiamen, five-good cadres, five-good youths, and various model figures in the past year.

    Many demobilized and retired soldiers are now the backbone of the militia organization. There are more than 700 demobilized and retired soldiers in Zhen'an County who are cadres above the militia platoon leader level. Dang Desuo, a retired soldier from the Qin'nan Brigade of the Dudian Commune in Heyang County, serves as the militia company commander of the production brigade. He insists on implementing the four firsts and the three-eight work style. Many militiamen have excellent live-fire shooting results and have been rated as the first-class militia company of the entire commune. Du Jichang, a retired soldier and former Eighth Route Army soldier from Huayin County, although old and weak, still often tells the militia, youth, and primary school students about Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and the revolutionary struggle stories of the old Red Army and old Eighth Route Army. He also often educates his son in the army to be a good successor to the revolution. Now, his son has been rated as a five-good soldier under the cultivation of the army party organization.

    Many families of soldiers often write letters to encourage their relatives in the army to learn the revolutionary spirit of Lei Feng and Wang Jie, to heighten their vigilance, strengthen combat readiness, and to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Li Cailing, a poor peasant girl from the Liupo Brigade of the Shiqiao Commune in Xianyang City, took the initiative to postpone her wedding in order to let her fiancé join the army. They took Lei Feng and Wang Jie as examples, and have always encouraged and helped each other. Now, her fiancé has been rated as a five-good technical pacesetter in the army, and Li Cailing loves the collective and works actively, and has also been rated as a five-good family member of soldiers and a five-good youth. Commune members praised them as "a pair of reds" in the front and rear. (Attached picture)
