    Proceeding from Reality, Break Down Foreign Shackles
    Ma Zhanyi, Deputy Director of Liaoning Transistor Factory
    Since our factory was established in 1960, we have been developing and manufacturing a large number of transistors for the country based on our own conditions, taking our own path, and using some simple equipment manufactured by ourselves and a new set of processes adapted to this equipment.
    However, we also took a detour in the first two years. Despite our hard work, our products consistently failed to meet technical standards.
    We then mobilized the masses to summarize our experiences and lessons, and discovered that we had not proceeded from our own characteristics, but had transplanted foreign processes applicable to imported equipment intact onto our own simple equipment, creating a contradiction between foreign processes and indigenous equipment.
    How to resolve this contradiction? Should we import foreign equipment to adapt to foreign processes, or should we change foreign processes to adapt to indigenous equipment? A fierce debate ensued throughout the factory.
    Some comrades believed that foreign processes were the accumulation of many years of experience, and could only be adopted, not changed, because changing them would violate science. Therefore, we could only import equipment and not reform processes.
    Most people disagreed with this view. Buying imported equipment would cost tens of thousands of yuan, while we only had several thousand yuan for experimental expenses. If this were the case, our factory would not be able to survive. How could that be allowed?
    We believe that no matter what science it is, it cannot be separated from conditions. Learning from others' processes and creating our own processes based on our own conditions is the scientific attitude. Disregarding one's own conditions and those of others, and forcibly transplanting others' processes, is a violation of science.
    Where to start the process reform? Through studying "On Practice," we and the technicians first went to the electrolytic process, which had a very low yield rate, to stay on the job and conduct investigations and research. We found that foreign processes stipulated that no testing should be carried out after electrolysis, and many unqualified products would go to the next process. We and the workers experimented with a simple testing method that allowed unqualified products to be reworked immediately, greatly improving the product yield. Our factory buildings were simple, affecting the unstable quality of the transistors. Especially during the rainy season, the scrap rate was very high. We and the workers and technicians repeatedly studied and used indigenous methods to manufacture a desiccant, applied it to the tube core, and sealed the cap under high-temperature protection, ensuring the quality of the transistors. Subsequently, we mobilized the masses to reform seven or eight processes, enabling the high-frequency small-power tubes to pass the technical barrier.
    At the beginning of 1964, we were assigned the task of trial-producing high-frequency high-power tubes, which were urgently needed by the country and were technically more complex. Some comrades said again that the technical requirements for high-power tubes were higher than those for small-power tubes, and we could only use foreign processes and no longer use indigenous methods. They advocated increasing modern equipment such as photolithography, hot pressing, and evaporation, which was impossible.
    Based on past experience, we firmly followed our own path. Therefore, we organized a trial production group led by a technical school graduate who was responsible, dared to think and act, implemented the "three-in-one combination," adopted indigenous methods, and boldly practiced.
    The key issue in trial-producing this tube was how to make strip electrodes. After repeated research and overcoming various difficulties, everyone finally created a new process for making strip electrodes that was even simpler than using modern equipment. In this way, high-frequency high-power tubes were also successfully trial-produced.
    Practice proves that exploring new technologies is like climbing a mountain; there is definitely more than one route. Although foreigners' ascent of Mount Everest from the south slope is a major achievement, the Chinese people's ascent of this highest peak in the world from the steep north slope is an even more glorious feat. In the field of science and technology, if we do not want to crawl behind others and want to catch up with and surpass them, we can only break down foreign shackles and take our own path.

    从实际出发  打破洋框框
    辽宁晶体管厂副厂长  马占一
    我们从一九六○年建厂以来，根据自己的条件，走自己的道路，用一些自己制造的简陋设备和适应这种设备的一套新工艺，为国家试制和生产了大量的晶体管。
    不过，我们开头两年也走了一段弯路。尽管穷干苦干，产品却老是过不了技术关。
    我们就发动群众，总结经验教训，这才发现我们没有从自己的特点出发，把适用于进口设备的外国工艺，原封不动地搬到自己制造的简陋设备上来，形成洋工艺和土设备之间的矛盾。
    怎样解决这个矛盾？是进口洋设备来适应洋工艺，还是改洋工艺来适应土设备？全厂发生了一场激烈的争论。
    有些同志认为，外国工艺是人家多年经验的积累，只能搬，不能改，改了就违反科学。因此，只能进口设备，不能改革工艺。
    大多数人不同意这个意见，买进口设备要花几万元，而我们只有几千元试验费。如果这样，我们工厂就不能存在了，这怎么行呢？
    我们认为，不管什么科学，总离不开条件。根据自己的条件，学习别人的工艺，创造自己的工艺，这才是科学的态度。不管自己的条件和别人的不同，而硬搬别人的工艺，这才是违反科学。
    改革工艺从哪里入手呢？通过学习《实践论》，我们和技术员首先到成品率很低的电解工序蹲点劳动，进行调查研究。我们发现，外国工艺规定，电解后不进行测试，许多不合格品就到了下一个工序。我们和工人一道，试验出一种简易的测试方法，使不合格品马上返修，大大提高了产品的成品率。我们的厂房简陋，影响到晶体管质量不稳定。特别是到了雨季，废品率很高。我们和工人、技术人员反复研究，用土办法制造了一种吸潮剂，涂在管芯上，并在高温保护下封帽，保证了晶体管的质量。接着，又发动群众改革了七八项工艺，使高频小功率管过了技术关。
    一九六四年初，我们又接受了试制国家很需要、技术更复杂的高频大功率管的任务。有的同志又说，大功率管比小功率管的技术要求高，只能用洋工艺，不能再用土办法了。他们主张增加光刻、热压、蒸发等现代化设备，而这是不可能的。
    我们根据过去的经验，坚决走自己的道路。于是，组织了一个由中专毕业的技术员负责的、敢想敢干的试制小组，实行三结合，采用土办法，大胆实践。
    试制这种管子的关键问题，是怎样做成条形电极。大家经过反复研究，克服种种困难，终于创造出一种比用现代化设备还简便的做条形电极的新工艺。这样，高频大功率管也试制成功了。
    实践证明：探索新的技术，也象登山一样，绝不止一条路。外国人从南坡登上珠穆朗玛峰，固然是重大成就，中国人从险峻的北坡登上这个世界最高峰，却是更光辉的功绩。在科学技术方面，要不跟在别人后面爬行，要赶上和超过别人，只有打破洋框框，走自己的道路。
