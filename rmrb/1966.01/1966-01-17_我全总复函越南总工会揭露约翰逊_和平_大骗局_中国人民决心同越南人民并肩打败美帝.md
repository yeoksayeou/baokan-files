    The ACFTU replies to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor exposing Johnson's "peace" hoax.
    The Chinese people are determined to fight alongside the Vietnamese people to defeat US imperialism.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 16th) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated in a reply letter to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor today that it fully agrees with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor's judgment that the large-scale campaign of so-called "seeking peace" and "goodwill" launched by the US government through the recent "suspension of air raids on North Vietnam" is completely deceptive.
    The reply letter said: "The so-called 'fourteen points' proposal for a 'peaceful resolution' of the Vietnam issue put forward by Johnson in this campaign is nothing more than demanding that the Vietnamese people abandon the four principles put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement put forward by the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only way to resolve the Vietnam issue. His coordination of the 'suspension of air raids on North Vietnam' with the 'fourteen points' proposal is actually an attempt to force the people of North Vietnam to abandon their support for their flesh-and-blood compatriots in the South. The US imperialists' intentions are extremely sinister."
    The letter from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was in response to a letter from Nguyen Van But, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, dated January 6. In the letter, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor pointed out that the US government's recent claim of having peaceful aspirations and sincerity through the "suspension of air raids on North Vietnam" is "a large-scale deceptive campaign."
  "This deception can never conceal its conspiracy to intensify and expand the war of aggression, nor can it conceal the extremely barbaric crimes committed by the US aggressors against the people of Vietnam and the people of Indochina." The letter cited facts to point out that the US imperialists' recent war conspiracies and war actions in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have once again torn off the hypocritical mask of the US government and exposed its false peace rhetoric. The letter stated: "Vietnamese workers and trade unions reiterate their iron will and firm determination that they will spare no sacrifice, fear no deprivation, and will, together with the entire Vietnamese people, carry the anti-US struggle to the end, resolutely defend North Vietnam, and liberate South Vietnam, in order to finally reunify the motherland. They are determined to fulfill their sacred duty, which is to defend the sovereignty and national independence of the motherland, thereby contributing to the common struggle of workers and people all over the world against US aggressors and war-mongers and to defend world peace."
    The reply letter from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated that Johnson's government's grand "peace talk" hoax and conspiracy is greatly exposed precisely because US imperialism is intensifying its inhumane "scorched earth policy" and the "three alls policy" of burn all, destroy all, and kill all in South Vietnam. The letter stated: "Chinese workers and the Chinese people are constantly vigilant against the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war and have made preparations. No matter what happens, we will always stand with the Vietnamese brothers and contribute all our strength to defeat US imperialism until final victory is achieved."

    我全总复函越南总工会揭露约翰逊“和平”大骗局
    中国人民决心同越南人民并肩打败美帝
    据新华社十六日讯　中华全国总工会今天在致越南总工会的一封复信中表示完全同意越南总工会的论断：美国政府最近通过“暂停空袭北越”所发动的所谓“谋求和平”和“善意”的大规模运动完全是骗人的。
    复信说：“约翰逊在这个运动中提出的所谓‘和平解决’越南问题的‘十四点’主张，只不过是要越南人民放弃以越南民主共和国政府提出的四项原则和越南南方民族解放阵线提出的五点声明作为解决越南问题的唯一途径。他把‘暂停空袭北越’同‘十四点’主张配合起来，实际上是要迫使越南北方人民放弃支援南方的骨肉同胞。美帝国主义的用心是极其险恶的。”
    中华全国总工会的这封信是答复越南总工会书记处书记阮文笔一月六日的来信的。越南总工会在来信中指出，美国政府最近通过“暂停空袭北越”声称它有和平愿望和诚意，是“一场大规模的欺骗运动”，
  “这一骗局绝不能掩盖它加紧和扩大侵略战争的阴谋，绝不能掩饰美国侵略者对越南人民和印度支那各国人民犯下的极端野蛮的罪行”。来信中例举事实，指出美帝国主义者近来在越南、老挝和柬埔寨的战争阴谋和战争行动，再次撕下了美国政府的伪善假面具，揭穿了它的假和平言论。信中说：“越南工人和工会再次重申他们钢铁般的意志和坚强决心，他们不惜牺牲、不怕匮乏，将和全体越南人民一起，把抗美斗争进行到底，坚定不移地保卫越南北方、解放越南南方，以便最后重新统一祖国。他们决心要完成自己的神圣职责，即保卫祖国的主权和民族的独立，从而对全世界工人和人民反对美国侵略者和战争贩子、保卫世界和平的共同斗争作出自己的贡献。”
    中华全国总工会的复信说，约翰逊政府的这个“和谈”大骗局、大阴谋正由于美帝国主义在越南南方加紧推行灭绝人性的“焦土政策”和烧光、毁光、杀光的“三光政策”而大大暴露。信中说：“中国工人和中国人民对美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋经常保持着警惕，并且已经作好了准备。不论发生什么情况，我们都将永远同越南兄弟站在一起，为打败美帝国主义贡献自己的全部力量，直到取得最后的胜利。”
