    Use Mao Zedong Thought to Advance the Rural Cultural Revolution
    The North China Regional Rural Propaganda and Cultural Work Conference Calls on All Localities to Carry Out a Struggle to Promote Proletarian Ideology and Eliminate Bourgeois Ideology in the Ideological Sphere, to Radically Destroy Old Capitalist and Feudalist Ideologies and Cultures, and to Vigorously Establish New Socialist Ideologies and Cultures
    Comrade Li Xuefeng Calls on Cultural Workers in North China to Highlight Politics and Go to the Countryside

    Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: Highlighting politics, facing the countryside, and delivering Mao Zedong Thought and the new socialist culture to the countryside so that propaganda and cultural work can better serve the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside and serve the broad masses of peasants. This is a major issue that was centrally resolved at the recent North China Regional Rural Propaganda and Cultural Work Conference.

    Li Xuefeng, First Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech at the conference. When talking about the current excellent situation, he pointed out that cultural workers must consciously grasp the situation and consider their work based on the situation, and cannot bury themselves in professional work all day long without asking about politics. The "professional work" we are talking about is first and foremost serving the people's cause and serving the socialist cause. Every specific job must adapt to this general requirement. Only in this way can we see the big picture from the small, and link our work with the overall work. If we deviate from politics and the situation, we will become short-sighted small characters.

    Li Xuefeng called on cultural workers in the North China region to go to the grassroots level, especially the production brigades and production teams in the countryside, to squat and earnestly participate in the socialist education movement, learn from it about the current Chinese society and the current national conditions, learn how to do mass work, transform their own positions, viewpoints and methods, and better serve the people.

    In his speech, Li Xuefeng also asked the rural Party organizations in the North China region to grasp the "literary" and the "military". He said, the "military" refers to the militia, and the "literary" mainly refers to the clubs. The clubs should carry out activities around the central work of the Party, and carry out their work to all aspects of the socialist education movement, to production, to militia work, and also to the homes of the commune members. He hoped that the cultural workers in the North China region would help the rural areas run the clubs well, send songs and operas, send books and newspapers to the countryside, and tutor rural amateur cultural activists to occupy and consolidate the ideological and cultural positions in the countryside with Mao Zedong Thought.

    The conference demanded that all parts of North China, in combination with the socialist education movement, vigorously carry out ideological and cultural revolution, carry out a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in the ideological sphere, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, radically destroy the old capitalist and feudalist ideologies and cultures, and vigorously establish new socialist ideologies and cultures. During the movement, it is necessary to organize the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, arm the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and resist the influence of various bourgeois ideas; educate peasants to break down feudal superstitious ideas and change backward customs; vigorously publicize good people and good deeds, new people and new things, and establish a new socialist ethos.

    In order to better carry out the ideological and cultural revolution in the countryside and firmly occupy the ideological and cultural positions in the countryside, the conference called for further development and consolidation of rural clubs. In the past year, the rural areas of North China have established and rectified a large number of clubs in the socialist education movement, and have played a good role in cooperating with the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, vigorously publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, and enlivening the cultural life of the masses. The experience of many places has proved that as long as clubs highlight politics, strengthen the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and carry out various activities centered on studying and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, they can become places where the broad masses of peasants vividly and lively conduct self-education. The activities of the clubs must adhere to the principles of amateurism, voluntarism, and small-scale diversification, and arrange activities and determine activity methods according to the agricultural season. The content of the activities must closely cooperate with the central work of the Party and the three great revolutionary movements, and better serve politics and serve production.

    The conference believed that establishing an amateur cultural team that can correctly implement the Party's literary and artistic policy and the principles of club activities is one of the keys to carrying out the socialist cultural revolution in the countryside. Therefore, the conference required Party organizations at all levels to strengthen their leadership over the clubs, educate the backbone members of the clubs to work hard to study Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in collective productive labor, establish a revolutionized ideology and style of work, and become red propagandists and production experts. Each club must cultivate a group of leading backbones with good ideology, good style, good labor, close ties with the masses, enthusiasm for club work, and certain activity abilities.

    The conference called on the propaganda and cultural departments above the county level in the North China region to truly face the countryside and better serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the countryside. All localities should carry out the "Four Goods" movement in the county opera troupes (good political ideology, good in going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, good quality in performing revolutionary modern operas, good in self-reliance and diligence in running the troupe); vigorously popularize film and slide projection work in the countryside; improve the publication and distribution of rural reading materials; run newspapers facing the countryside well; and develop and improve rural wired broadcasting.

    During the conference, advanced units from various aspects introduced their experiences in highlighting politics, facing the countryside, and serving the peasants.

    At the meeting, everyone compared themselves with the political work of the People's Liberation Army and found gaps. They unanimously agreed that in the future they must learn from the People's Liberation Army, highlight politics, strengthen political and ideological work, adhere to the "Four Firsts" and the "Three-Eight Style," and strive to make the cultural team in the North China region take a big step forward on the road of revolutionization and combatization in the next few years, and make the rural propaganda and cultural work present a new look.

    用毛泽东思想推进农村文化革命
    华北区农村宣传、文化工作会议要求各地开展意识形态领域中兴无灭资的斗争，大破资本主义封建主义的旧思想旧文化，大立社会主义的新思想新文化
    李雪峰同志号召华北区文化工作者突出政治到农村去
    新华社九日讯　突出政治，面向农村，把毛泽东思想和社会主义新文化送到农村去，使宣传、文化工作更好地为农村三大革命运动服务，为广大农民服务。这是最近举行的华北区农村宣传、文化工作会议集中解决的一个主要问题。
    中共中央华北局第一书记李雪峰在这次会上作了讲话。他在谈到当前大好形势时指出，文化工作者要自觉地把握形势，根据形势考虑自己的工作，不能成天埋头业务，不问政治。我们所讲的业务，首先是务人民之业，务社会主义之业。每一项具体工作都要适应这个总的要求。这样，才能小中见大，把自己的工作与整个工作联系起来。如果脱离政治，脱离形势，就会变成鼠目寸光的小人物。
    李雪峰号召华北地区的文化工作者，到基层特别是农村的生产大队和生产队去蹲点，认真参加社会主义教育运动，从中了解中国现在的社会、现在的国情，学习做群众工作，改造自己的立场、观点和方法，更好地为人民服务。
    李雪峰在讲话中还要求华北地区农村党组织抓好一
  “文”一“武”。他说，“武”是民兵，“文”主要是俱乐部。俱乐部要围绕党的中心工作开展活动，把工作做到社会主义教育运动的各个环节上去，做到生产中去，做到民兵工作中去，还要做到社员家里去。他希望华北地区的文化工作者帮助农村办好俱乐部，为农村送歌送戏，送书送报，辅导农村业余文化积极分子，用毛泽东思想占领和巩固农村的思想文化阵地。
    会议要求，华北各地要结合社会主义教育运动大力进行思想文化革命，开展意识形态领域中兴无灭资的斗争，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大破资本主义、封建主义旧思想、旧文化，大立社会主义的新思想、新文化。在运动中，要组织群众学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，抵制各种资产阶级思想的影响；教育农民破除封建迷信思想，改变落后的习俗；大力宣传好人好事，新人新事，树立社会主义的新风尚。
    为了更好地开展农村的思想文化革命，巩固地占领农村思想文化阵地，会议要求进一步发展和巩固农村俱乐部。近一年来，华北农村在社会主义教育运动中，建立和整顿了大批俱乐部，在配合阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的三大革命运动，大力宣传毛泽东思想，活跃群众文化生活等方面，起了良好的作用。许多地方的经验证明，俱乐部只要做到突出政治，加强兴无灭资的斗争，以学习和宣传毛泽东思想为中心开展各种活动，就能成为广大农民生动活泼地进行自我教育的场所。俱乐部的活动要坚持业余、自愿和小型多样的原则，根据农事季节安排活动和确定活动方式。活动内容必须密切配合党的中心工作和三大革命运动，更好地为政治服务，为生产服务。
    会议认为，建立一支能够正确执行党的文艺方针和俱乐部活动原则的业余文化队伍，是在农村中开展社会主义文化革命的关键之一。因此，会议要求各级党组织加强对俱乐部的领导，教育俱乐部的骨干分子努力学习毛主席著作，积极参加集体生产劳动，树立革命化的思想作风，成为红色宣传员和生产能手。每个俱乐部都要培养一批思想好、作风好、劳动好、密切联系群众、热心俱乐部工作而又有一定活动能力的领导骨干。
    会议要求，华北地区县以上的宣传、文化部门要切实面向农村，更好地为农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。各地要在县剧团中开展“四好”运动（政治思想好、上山下乡好、演革命现代戏质量好、自力更生勤俭办团好）；大力普及农村的电影和幻灯放映工作；改进农村读物的出版和发行工作；办好面向农村的报纸；发展和提高农村有线广播。
    会议期间，各方面的先进单位介绍了他们突出政治，面向农村，为农民服务的经验。
    会上大家对照解放军的政治工作找了差距，一致认为今后必须大学解放军，突出政治，加强政治思想工作，坚持四个第一和三八作风，争取在今后几年内使华北区的文化队伍在革命化、战斗化的道路上大大前进一步，使农村宣传、文化工作出现一个新的面貌。
