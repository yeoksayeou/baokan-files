    Active Living Thoughts on Newspapers in Various Places
    The Art of Holding Meetings
    The Hanzhong Special District of Shaanxi recently convened a representative meeting of advanced units and activists in studying Chairman Mao's works. Holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasping the prominent contradictions in current agricultural production, exposing complacency, further examining thoughts, identifying the ideological roots of neglecting politics and focusing solely on production and individualism, and ultimately focusing on transforming thinking through studying Chairman Mao's works. In this way, the problem became clear, the direction became clear, people's mental state was revitalized, and it immediately promoted current production.
    The "Shaanxi Daily" published a short commentary stating: No matter what kind of business meeting is held, it has its own business problems, but there is a common task, which is to use Mao Zedong Thought as the "arrow" to shoot at the "target" of actual work. If a business meeting does not highlight politics and does not solve the problem of people's revolutionization, it is impossible to promote the revolutionization of work. Even a political work meeting, if it talks about politics in a general way, does not combine it with real struggles, and does not grasp people's living thoughts, politics cannot exert its power.
    Holding meetings is nothing more than checking work, summarizing experience, studying problems, and deploying new tasks. How well the meeting is held and whether it can complete the task satisfactorily depends most importantly on what takes command. Not highlighting politics, only talking about business, is putting business in command; even if you grasp the thinking, but only grasp the business thinking, and no longer deeply pursue the issue of business serving politics, the issue of the two-line struggle in business, it is still business thinking in command, not true political command. Chairman Mao's book is the supreme instruction for all work. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to take command, check work, summarize experience, analyze problems, exchange ideas, and finally accurately shoot at the "target" in people's thinking, and promote people's revolutionization; on this basis, clarifying business policies and business viewpoints can promote the revolutionization of work. Such a meeting is lively, full of enthusiasm, opens up a political direction, and creates a spirit, which is considered a truly politically commanding and revolutionary meeting.
    How to "Thoroughly Understand the Bottom"
    Longhai District in Luliang County, Yunnan, is extremely short of water. Not only is there no water for irrigation, but even drinking water for people and animals is very difficult. Comrade Zhang Denggao, the county party secretary, decided to solve this problem. The first time, relying on some one-sided information, he built large and medium-sized reservoirs, wanting to solve the irrigation and drinking water problems for people and animals in Longhai in one step, but none of them were solved. The second time, starting from understanding the specific situation in the district, understanding the urgent needs of the local people, first starting to solve the drinking water problem for people and animals, and then solving the farmland irrigation problem, the water conservancy construction in this district quickly achieved results.
    The "Yunnan Daily" published a short commentary on this, saying: What is meant by thoroughly understanding the bottom? Generally, it is believed that understanding the actual situation clearly means thoroughly understanding the bottom. In fact, this statement is still not very accurate. How can it be considered a clear understanding? If it only means seeing, hearing, and feeling many perceptual materials, and only having many perceptual understandings, that is far from enough, and it cannot be considered a thorough understanding. Thoroughly understanding the bottom refers to having a regular understanding of the actual situation.
    Sensory materials are also very important. Only when the sensory materials are very rich and consistent with reality can correct concepts and reasoning be created. But sensory materials are one-sided and superficial and cannot fully reflect the essence of things. When understanding remains at this stage, because the essence of things cannot be grasped, the correct guidelines for guiding work cannot be derived. This is the main reason why the water control work in the Longhai mountainous area has not made much progress. When people's understanding deepens, the water control work greatly advances. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with a general, one-sided, and superficial understanding of the situation. A cadre who was born and raised locally should also pay attention to this issue.
    Conditions for Climbing New Peaks
    Huanglu Commune is located in the Jianghuai hilly area, where natural conditions are poor. Two years ago, it exceeded the "Program" for both grain and cotton, reaching a peak. Some people felt satisfied with this, believing that it would be good enough to maintain this achievement in 1965. The commune party committee and the majority of cadres and commune members did not think so. They used the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to summarize their work, found the potential, proceeded from objective reality, adopted correct measures to increase production, and created new conditions for increasing production. Despite suffering from a severe drought last year, the grain and cotton output still reached a new level.
    The "Anhui Daily" published an editorial stating that striving for higher yields on the basis of high yields requires people to spend more effort and put in more labor. Because under certain conditions, increasing production has a "ceiling" and potential has an "end." To climb from one peak to a higher peak, it is necessary to change the old conditions and create new conditions. This requires people to be good at conducting new explorations of nature and many unrecognized things, find new ways to achieve high yields, and conduct arduous struggles to open up this path. Therefore, high-yielding units must strive for even higher yields, combine a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a rigorous scientific attitude, despise difficulties strategically, and value difficulties tactically; they must implement the revolutionary spirit in scientific experiments, in grasping the objective laws of things, and in transforming natural conditions and other practical measures to increase production, put in hard work, do "stupid" work, and create conditions for higher yields. The process of striving for high yields and even higher yields is also a process of further understanding objective laws and creating new production conditions through practice. The reason why Huanglu Commune has achieved new achievements in production struggles is precisely because they have combined the revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude very well and have done a lot of work.

### 活跃在各地报纸上的活思想

    活跃在各地报纸上的活思想
    开会的艺术
    陕西汉中专区最近召开了学习毛主席著作先进单位和积极分子代表会议。高举毛泽东思想红旗，抓住当前农业生产方面的突出矛盾，揭露自满情绪，进一步检查思想，找出了忽视政治的单纯生产观点和个人主义的思想根源，最后落实到学习毛主席著作改造思想上。这样，问题就看得透了，方向就看得清了，人的精神状态为之一振，立竿见影地推动了当前生产。
    《陕西日报》发表短评说：不管开什么业务会，都有自己的业务问题，但都有一个共同的任务，就是用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射实际工作之“的”。业务会不突出政治，不解决人的革命化问题，就不可能促进工作的革命化。即使是政治工作会，如果泛泛地讲政治，不结合现实斗争，不抓人的活思想，政治也不可能发挥威力。
    开会，无非是为了检查工作，总结经验，研究问题，布置新的任务。会开得怎么样，能否圆满地完成任务，最重要的是看什么挂帅。不突出政治，就业务谈业务，是业务挂帅；即使抓了思想，但是抓到业务思想为止，不再深追业务为政治服务的问题、业务中两条路线斗争的问题，仍然是业务思想挂帅，不是真正的政治挂帅。毛主席的书是一切工作的最高指示，只有以毛泽东思想挂帅，检查工作，总结经验，分析问题，思想交锋，最后射准人思想中的“的”，促进人的革命化；在这个基础上，明确业务政策、业务观点，才能促进工作的革命化。这样的会，开得活，开得热气腾腾，开出一个政治方向来，开出一股劲来，才算是真正的政治挂帅、革命化的会。
    怎样“吃透下头”
    云南陆良县龙海区水源十分缺乏，不仅灌溉无水，就连人畜吃水都非常困难。县委书记张登高同志决定解决这个问题。第一次，凭着了解的一些片面情况，修大、中型水库，想一步登天，解决龙海的灌溉和人畜吃水问题，结果一项也没有解决。第二次，从摸这个区的具体情况入手，了解当地群众的迫切要求，先着手解决人畜吃水问题，然后解决农田灌溉问题，这个区的水利建设很快取得了成绩。
    《云南日报》为此发表短评说：什么叫作吃透下头呢？一般都以为，把实际情况了解清楚，就是吃透下头了。其实这种说法还是不很准确的。怎样才是了解清楚呢？如果只是意味着看到、听到和感觉到许多感性的材料，只是有了许多感性的认识，那是很不够的，那是不能算作吃透的。吃透下头，指的是对于实际情况有了规律性的了解。
    感觉的材料，也是非常重要的，只有感觉的材料十分丰富和合于实际，才能造出正确的概念和论理来。但感觉材料是片面的和表面的东西，不能完全地反映事物的本质。当着认识还停留在这个阶段的时候，由于把握不住事物的本质，就不能得出指导工作的正确方针。这是龙海山区的治水工作进展不大的主要原因。而当着人们的认识深化以后，治水工作就大大前进了。所以，我们一定不要满足于对情况的一般的、片面的、表面的了解。一个本地生、本地长的干部，同样要注意这个问题。
    攀登新高峰的条件
    黄麓公社地处江淮丘陵区，自然条件不好，前年粮棉双超“纲要”，登上了一个高峰。这样，有些人感到满足了，认为在一九六五年能保住这个成绩就不赖了。公社党委和多数干部、社员却不这样看，他们用“一分为二”的观点总结工作，找出了潜力所在，从客观实际出发，采取正确的增产措施，创造新的增产条件，尽管去年遭到大旱，粮棉产量仍然更上了一层楼。
    《安徽日报》发表社论说，在高产的基础上争取更高产，需要人们花费更大的力气，付出更多的劳动。因为在一定条件下，增产是有“顶”、潜力是有“尽”的，要从一个高峰攀上一个更高峰，必须改变旧的条件，创造新的条件。这就要人们善于对自然、对许多不认识的事物进行新的探索，找出新的高产道路，并为开辟这个道路进行艰苦的斗争。所以高产单位要争取更高产，必须把高度的革命精神与严谨的科学态度结合起来，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难；必须把革命精神落实到科学实验中去，落实到掌握事物的客观规律上去，落实到改造自然条件和其他切实的增产措施中去，下苦功夫，做“笨”工作，为更高产创造条件。争取高产更高产的过程，也是通过实践进一步认识客观规律和创造新的生产条件的过程。黄麓公社在生产斗争中所以取得新的成就，正是他们把革命精神和科学态度很好地结合起来，做了大量工作的结果。
