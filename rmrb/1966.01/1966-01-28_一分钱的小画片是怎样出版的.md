	Last year, the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House published more than twenty kinds of one-cent small picture cards, and some low-priced picture cards and picture albums, which were very popular among the masses.
	The publication of one-cent small picture cards has undergone a tortuous process. In the past, we had two relatively common ideas about the publication of art books: First, we believed that New Year pictures, comic strips, and propaganda posters were popular varieties, while picture albums, picture collections, and picture cards were for improvement. Second, although we did not agree with the above view of separating popularization and improvement, we believed that in order to ensure a certain quality of art publications, the paper had to be better, and the plate making and printing had to be more exquisite, so higher prices were inevitable. In fact, both of these ideas are metaphysical. In its ideological essence, it is a lack of interest in serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and a manifestation of bourgeois artistic viewpoints. In the process of the Cultural Revolution, we conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works, criticized these two wrong ideas, and corrected the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. We took the initiative to step out of the editorial office, solicited opinions from the masses, and understood the situation. While trying, we conducted investigations and research, and finally initially resolved the contradiction between printing quality and pricing in the publication of picture cards and picture albums, and produced one-cent small picture cards. It can be said that the one-cent picture card is a product of the Cultural Revolution and also a product of studying Chairman Mao's works.
	In the past few years, we conducted several surveys among readers on their opinions on art publications, but at that time we did not use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers was not clear, so the surveys did not yield results. Last year, after studying Daqing and learning from the People's Liberation Army, our ideological understanding was improved, and we strengthened our desire to serve the countryside. We also organized groups to conduct investigations in Songjiang and Chuansha counties. We adopted the method of setting up stalls in streets, tea houses, commune members' homes, threshing floors, and fields to sell and solicit opinions from the peasant masses to understand whether our art publications were in line with the needs of the peasants in terms of content and to see if the peasants wanted to buy these works. At that time, we found that peasants—especially young peasants—did not dislike oil paintings, prints, traditional Chinese paintings, and watercolors. As long as the content was good, the tone was healthy, and the paintings were detailed, they were willing to accept them. However, mass acceptance was one thing, and affordability was another. The general opinion was that the pricing was too high. After research, we had planned to select some works popular with farmers, reprint them on poster paper, and lower the price for trial sales in rural areas. However, at that time, issues such as the subject matter content, the size of the sheets, the amount of price reduction, and the printing effect of poster paper were not resolved. We also considered whether Xinhua Bookstore was willing to order and distribute them, fearing that printing them would lead to unsalable goods, accumulation of funds, and waste. Therefore, we had many concerns and did not do it immediately.
	The vigorous development of the Cultural Revolution further broadened our horizons. After conscientiously studying Chairman Mao's works, we further clarified the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. After going deep into life and working as shop assistants in bookstores, the editorial staff of the publishing house also had a better understanding of the requirements of different readers, the quality and pricing of art publications, and sales. When we were working behind the counter in the bookstore, we found that many readers wanted to buy reduced sample sheets of New Year pictures and propaganda posters. This gave us great inspiration: Why not use existing plates to print reduced samples separately into single small picture cards? A full-sheet reduced sample costs 15 cents, and separating it into 32-sheet small picture cards would cost one cent each. Sure enough, the small picture cards published in this way were warmly welcomed by readers. At the same time, the leading cadres of the publishing house were also inspired while working behind the counter: They saw that the quality of the picture cards printed by other art publishing houses on poster paper was not much different from that of high-grade paper, but the price was relatively low, and there were many buyers. Why don't we learn from them? Therefore, we selected a batch of works from the East China Art Exhibition and the Third Art Exhibition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and printed them on poster paper in formats such as sixteen-sheet and eight-sheet, priced at three cents and six cents per sheet, respectively. Three thousand sheets of each type were printed for trial. However, shortly after publication, the bookstore immediately requested reprints again and again. These attempts broke the framework that poster paper could not be used to print art picture cards and found a way to resolve the contradiction. Our confidence increased, and we saw the broad world of popular picture cards serving the masses. Subsequently, we successively published propaganda poster collections, collections against U.S. aggression and aid to Vietnam, collections of class struggle serial pictures, and other picture cards of different sizes priced at one cent per sheet. The prices were generally reduced by 50%, 60%, or even 80%.
	In the past, we also printed picture cards on poster paper. Seven or eight years ago, we printed the published calendar New Year pictures into small poster paper picture cards every year. The price was very low, and the sales were very good. But at that time, we in the editorial department thought that picture cards printed on poster paper were too unsightly, so no one looked down on them or paid attention to the printing quality, and there were some perfunctory phenomena. As a result, not only did this variety not develop, but it was also eliminated invisibly. This shows that we did not think about serving workers, peasants, and soldiers at that time.
	Last September and October, we jointly formed an investigation and research group with Xinhua Bookstore and went to Yangzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province for investigation. We still adopted methods such as exhibitions, stall sales, and seminars. The scene of the masses crowding to buy paintings was really unexpected. We met with more than 200 grassroots art workers at more than a dozen seminars; we contacted more than 2,000 rural readers at more than a dozen painting stalls and sold more than 6,000 copies of picture cards, collections, and other art publications. This was a vivid education for us, and it greatly encouraged us. A few examples can illustrate the enthusiastic scene of farmers buying paintings.
	When we hung up picture cards and set up stalls in Sanchahe, Yangzhou Prefecture, we were warmly welcomed by local cadres and the masses. They said that we were "the first to send picture cards to the countryside." When the masses learned that we had one-cent propaganda picture cards, some farmers said: "Are these clearance items?" This sentence shows how seriously we were divorced from our peasant brothers in the past! They simply could not imagine that we were specially publishing one-cent picture cards for them. After our explanation, they said: "You listened to Chairman Mao and became revolutionary." This is the greatest encouragement to us from our peasant brothers. We deeply feel that we have served our peasant brothers too little in the past. The commune members happily bought many one-cent picture cards, and also bought many small picture albums, large picture cards, and some popular text books such as "How to Cut Paper" and "Introduction to Art Works."
	Another example is the scene of selling paintings at Nanhui County Middle School in the suburbs of Shanghai, which also moved us very much. (This school has more than 1,000 students, and about 600 to 700 students have lunch at school, most of whom are children of farmers.) We took advantage of the lunch break to set up stalls to sell paintings, and the students rushed to buy them enthusiastically. All of a sudden, more than 1,600 sheets (sets) of art works were sold, among which the one-cent small picture cards were particularly popular, such as "Long Live Leninism," "Revolution for a Lifetime, Reading Chairman Mao's Books for a Lifetime," and "Learning from the People's Liberation Army and Realizing Revolutionization." In addition, photographic picture cards such as "Chairman Mao Working in the Plane" and "Chairman Mao's Good Soldier - Lei Feng" were also quickly sold out.
	From several rural painting sales surveys, on the one hand, we saw the urgent need for cultural food among the vast rural educated youth and the important significance of art publications cooperating with the rural socialist education movement; we saw that publishing these picture cards would not cause the country to lose money, farmers could afford them, and the picture cards had a broad world for serving the countryside. On the other hand, we also discovered that there were still some problems in our picture card editing, publishing, and distribution work, such as the subject matter content was not rich enough and the varieties were not diverse enough. In addition, the distribution work also needs to be improved, and more conditions need to be created to make the small picture cards more widely distributed to the countryside.
	In short, through investigation and research and repeated practice, we deeply realized that it is completely right and completely feasible for art works to serve the countryside. At the same time, we also realized that to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is impossible to do it without studying Chairman Mao's works hard and without a fiery heart. In the future, we must continue to transform our thinking, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and gradually solve the various contradictions in our work.
	Of course, while solving the problem of popularizing picture cards, we must also further solve the problem of popularizing picture albums. The publication of advanced paintings is still needed, but we must never blindly improve without direction like in the past. This requires us to correctly understand the relationship between popularization and improvement under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, face the countryside, and do our work well to promote the prosperity and development of the socialist art cause.

    一分钱的小画片是怎样出版的
    上海人民美术出版社美术编辑室
    去年上海人民美术出版社出版了二十多种一分钱的小画片，和一些定价低廉的画片、画辑，很受群众欢迎。
    关于一分钱小画片的出版，有着一段曲折的过程。过去我们对于美术读物的出版，曾有两种较为普遍的思想：一、认为年画、连环画、宣传画是普及的品种，而画册、画辑、画片则是提高的东西。二、虽然不同意上面那种把普及和提高分割开来的看法，但又认为为了保证美术出版物的一定质量，纸张就得要好一些，制版、印刷总要精美些，定价高些也就是必然的了。其实，这两种思想都是形而上学的。在思想实质上是对为工农兵服务不感兴趣，是一种资产阶级艺术观点的表现。在文化革命的过程中，我们认真学习了毛主席著作，批判了这两种错误思想，端正了为工农兵服务的方向。我们主动走出编辑室，到群众中征求意见，了解情况，一边尝试，一边调查研究，终于在画片、画辑出版方面初步解决了印制质量和定价之间的矛盾，生产出了一分钱的小画片。可以说，一分钱一张的小画片是文化革命的产物，也是学习毛主席著作的产物。
    前几年，我们在读者中作过几次对美术出版物意见的调查，但是那时我们没有以毛泽东思想作指导，为工农兵服务的方向不明确，所以调查了也没有结果。去年经过学习大庆、学习解放军，我们思想认识有了提高，加强了为农村服务的愿望。又组织了小组，到松江、川沙两县农村进行调查。采用在街头、茶馆、社员之家、打麦场、田头等场所摆摊出售和征求农民群众意见的办法，了解我们的美术出版物在内容上是否和农民对口？看看农民是否要买这些作品。当时我们发现，农民——尤其是青年农民，并不是不喜欢油画、版画、国画和水彩画，只要内容好，情调健康，画得细致一些，他们是愿意接受的。但是群众欢迎是一回事，能不能买得起又是一回事，普遍的意见是定价太高了。我们研究以后，曾经准备选一些受农民欢迎的作品，改用招贴纸印刷，降低定价，再到农村试销。但当时对题材内容、开张大小、降价多少、招贴纸的印刷效果如何等问题没有解决，又考虑新华书店是否愿意订货发行，怕印了销不掉，积压资金，造成浪费，因此顾虑很多，没有立即去做。
    文化革命运动的蓬勃开展，进一步打开了我们的眼界，经过认真学习毛主席著作，进一步明确了为工农兵服务的方向。出版社编辑干部经过深入生活，到书店当营业员，对于不同读者的要求，美术出版物的质量、定价和销售情况，也有了更多的了解。我们在书店站柜台时，发现不少读者要买年画、宣传画的缩小样张。这对我们有很大的启发：为什么不利用现成版子，把缩样分开来印成单张小画片呢？对开缩样一张一角五分，分开来印成三十二开小画片就可以一分一张。果然，这样出版的小画片受到读者的热烈欢迎。与此同时，出版社的领导干部也在站柜台时受到了启发：看到别的美术出版社用招贴纸印刷的画片质量并不比高级纸差多少，定价却比较便宜，购买者很多。我们为什么不好好学习呢？于是就选了一批华东地区美展作品和中国人民解放军第三届美展作品，分别以十六开、八开等形式用招贴纸印刷，定价每张三分、六分。每种先行试印三千张。可是出版后不久，书店马上一再要求添印。这些尝试打破了招贴纸不能印艺术画片的框框，找到了解决矛盾的方法。我们的信心增强了，看到了通俗画片为群众服务的广阔天地。接着我们陆续出版了以一分钱一张计价的宣传画小辑，援越抗美小辑，阶级斗争组画小辑，以及其他不同开张的大小画片。定价普遍降低了百分之五十、六十甚至百分之八十。
    用招贴纸印刷画片，过去也曾印过。七八年前，我们每年把已出版过的月份牌年画印成招贴纸小画片，价钱很低，销路很好。但那时候我们编辑思想上，认为画片印在招贴纸上太不象样，因此谁也瞧不起它，也不重视印刷质量，有些应付的现象。因之后来这个品种不仅没有得到发展，而且无形中被淘汰了。这说明我们那时候并没想到为工农兵服务的问题。
    去年九、十月间，我们与新华书店联合组成调查研究组，共同去江苏省扬州专区调查，仍采取展览，摆摊出售，座谈等方式。群众拥挤买画的情形真是出人意料，在十几次座谈会上，与二百多个基层美术工作人员会了面；在十几次卖画摊上，与二千多农村读者接触，共约卖出画片、小辑，以及其他美术出版物六千多份。这对我们是一次生动的教育，也使我们从中得到了很大的鼓舞。举几个例子，可以说明农民买画的热烈情景。
    我们在扬州专区三汊河地方，张挂画片和摆摊子的时候，受到当地干部、群众的热烈欢迎，他们说我们“第一次把画片送到了农村。”当群众知道我们有一分一张的宣传小画片时候，有的农民讲：这是处理品吧！这句话说明，过去我们是多么严重的脱离了农民弟兄啊！他们简直想不到我们是专门为他们出版一分钱一张的画片的。经我们解释以后，他们说：“你们听了毛主席的话，革命化了。”这是农民兄弟对我们的最大的鼓励，我们深感过去为农民兄弟服务得太少了。社员群众兴高采烈地买了很多一分钱一张的小画片，还买了不少小画辑、大画片和《怎样剪纸》《美术作品介绍》等一些通俗文字书。
    再如在上海郊区南汇县中学的一次卖画的情形，也使我们很感动。（这个学校有一千多名学生，中午在校用膳的学生约有六七百人，他们大都是农民子弟）我们利用午饭后休息时间摆开摊子卖画，学生们争先恐后地踊跃购买。一下子共卖了一千六百多张（套）美术作品，其中特别受欢迎的还是一分钱一张的小画片，如《列宁主义万岁》《干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书》《学习解放军，实现革命化》等。此外《毛主席在飞机中工作》《毛主席的好战士——雷锋》等摄影画片，也很快就卖完了。
    从几次农村卖画的调查中，一方面我们看到广大农村知识青年迫切需要文化食粮的情况，和美术出版物配合农村社会主义教育运动的重要意义；看到出版这种画片，国家不亏赔，农民买得起，画片有了为农村服务的广阔天地。另方面也发现了我们在画片编辑、出版发行工作中，还存在一些问题，如题材内容还不够丰富，品种还不够多样。此外，发行工作也还有待改进，要创造更多的条件才能使小画片更广泛的发行到农村。
    总之，通过调查研究和反复实践，我们深深认识到：美术作品为农村服务是完全应该、完全可行的。同时，我们也认识到，要为工农兵服务，假若不努力学好毛主席著作，没有一颗火热的心是做不到的。今后还要继续改造思想，深入调查研究，逐步解决工作中的种种矛盾。
    当然，在解决画片通俗化问题的同时，还要进一步解决画册的普及问题。高级画的出版也还是需要的，但决不能象过去那样没有方向的盲目提高。这就要求我们在毛泽东文艺思想的指导下，正确理解普及和提高的关系，面向农村，为促进社会主义美术事业的繁荣和发展，做好我们的工作。
