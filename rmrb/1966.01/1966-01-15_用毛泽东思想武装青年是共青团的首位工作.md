    Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm Youth is the Primary Task of the Communist Youth League
    Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Holds On-Site Meeting on Rural Youth Studying Chairman Mao's Works
    The meeting emphasized: Currently, Youth League organizations should further organize youth to study Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people, study Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, his related expositions on imperialism, his theory on class and class struggle during the socialist period, and his instructions on self-reliance, striving for progress, hard work, and building the country through thrift; educate youth to contribute to the completion of the Third Five-Year Plan and prepare for crushing the US imperialist aggression war.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 14th)　Highlighting politics, closely following the situation, and making the activities of rural youth studying Chairman Mao's works more extensive and deeper are the important topics of the national on-site conference on rural youth studying Chairman Mao's works recently held by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in Lijiazhuang, Shandong.
    The meeting pointed out while analyzing the excellent situation of the current socialist revolution and socialist construction in my country's rural areas that the revolutionary spirit of the vast rural youth is unprecedentedly high, and the activities of studying Chairman Mao's works have never been as widespread as they are now. The meeting believes that my country has begun to implement the Third Five-Year Plan, and US imperialism and its running dogs are frantically carrying out war provocations against our country. This new situation puts forward higher requirements for the Communist Youth League organizations, which requires further highlighting politics in the work, placing the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place of the League's work; using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the youth, giving play to the youth's vanguard role in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment; educating the youth to contribute to the completion of the Third Five-Year Plan, preparing for crushing the US imperialist aggression war, and realizing ideological revolutionization in the struggle.
    This meeting summarized the experiences of advanced Youth League branches such as the Chengguan Commune Lijiazhuang in Linqu County, Shandong Province, in organizing youth to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way (the experience of the Lijiazhuang Youth League Branch was introduced on the second page of this newspaper on August 29, 1965). The basic experiences of these advanced Youth League branches are: highlighting politics, placing the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place of the League's work; adhering to the study style of linking theory with practice, especially working hard on the word "application"; proceeding from reality and following the mass line.
    The representatives of advanced Youth League branches and study activists from various places who participated in the meeting used a large number of facts to illustrate that the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the youth, is the guarantee for doing all work well. Where the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high, the League's work is done well, and the role of youth in the revolutionary struggle and production struggle is prominent. Where Mao Zedong Thought is not highlighted, the League's work is not successful, and may even lose its direction. The meeting believes that the task of the Communist Youth League, in the final analysis, is to cultivate successors for the revolutionary cause. Therefore, highlighting politics and Mao Zedong Thought is of particularly important significance to the League's work. Whether or not the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought is put in the first place is essentially a question of whether to educate youth with Mao Zedong Thought or with bourgeois and feudal ideologies. The Communist Youth League organizations must firmly and unswervingly use Mao Zedong Thought to take command in all work, and take organizing youth to study Chairman Mao's works in a living way as the center, to drive all the political and ideological work of the League.
    The meeting summarized the experience of some advanced Youth League branches in adhering to the study style of linking theory with practice, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, especially working hard on the word "application". The most fundamental reason why the activities of studying Chairman Mao's works in advanced Youth League branches such as Lijiazhuang have achieved great results is that they have gradually clarified that the purpose of learning is for the revolution, to revolutionize the subjective world and revolutionize the objective world. In the study, they combined learning with application, studied diligently, and applied earnestly, so that the study closely kept up with the development of the revolutionary struggle situation, combined study with revolutionary struggle, combined transforming the subjective world with transforming the objective world, and combined organizing study with organizing revolutionary practice. Therefore, the meeting emphasized that, in addition to further organizing youth to study Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people, League organizations should focus on organizing youth to study Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, his related expositions on imperialism, establish the idea of hating, despising, and scorning US imperialism, actively participate in military training activities and military sports activities, and be ready at any time to fight against the expansion of the US imperialist war of aggression to our country. Organize youth to study Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle during the socialist period, actively participate in the socialist education movement, participate in the class struggle in the ideological field, promote proletarian ideology, and eliminate bourgeois ideology. Organize youth to study Chairman Mao's instructions on self-reliance, striving for progress, hard work, and building the country through thrift, resolutely implement the general line of socialist construction, go all out, aim high, and be the shock force for realizing the Third Five-Year Plan.
    The meeting discussed the ongoing campaign to learn from Wang Jie. Everyone believed that to better learn from Wang Jie, one should further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, just like Wang Jie.
    In the context of a new upsurge in the activities of rural youth studying Chairman Mao's works nationwide, the meeting emphasized that organizing and guiding learning activities should pay special attention to proceeding from reality and following the mass line. This requires adhering to the principle of conscious voluntarism; being good at proceeding from the current needs of the struggle and the different situations and preferences of young people, and in the guidance of learning activities, both grasping tightly and making it lively. Grasping tightly means grasping without letting go, repeatedly implementing, persevering, and constantly improving. The so-called "lively" means that the leadership should be lively, the tutoring should be lively, and especially, the youth should be guided to learn and apply in a lively way.
    The meeting believed that Youth League committees above the county level should focus on doing three things well. First, grasp the learning of full-time League cadres, especially the learning of the League committee's leadership core, and first revolutionize the thinking of League cadres and revitalize the revolutionary spirit. Second, grasp the learning backbone (study activists, League's grassroots cadres, study instructors, etc.), give them help in ideology and politics, and through them, drive the vast number of youth to study Chairman Mao's works well. Third, grasp advanced models, both models of grassroots League organizations and models of League members and youth. This is the fundamental method of guiding learning activities, and we must make up our minds and use the greatest strength to do it.
    More than 200 representatives of advanced Youth League branches, study activists, and League cadres at all levels from all over the country participated in this meeting. During the meeting, the representatives visited Lijiazhuang and the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, the Xiadingjia Brigade in Shandong Province, the Linyi Prefecture, as well as the Lijiazhai Brigade and Dongzhangtun Brigade in this prefecture.

    用毛泽东思想武装青年是共青团的首位工作
    团中央举行全国农村青年学习毛主席著作现场会议
    会议强调：当前团组织要进一步组织青年学习毛主席的为人民服务的思想，学习毛主席关于人民战争的思想，关于帝国主义的有关论述，关于社会主义时期阶级和阶级斗争的理论，关于自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的指示；教育青年为完成第三个五年计划作出贡献，为粉碎美帝侵略战争做好准备
    新华社十四日讯　突出政治，紧跟形势，使农村青年学习毛主席著作的活动更加广泛、更加深入地开展起来，是共青团中央最近在山东李家庄举行的全国农村青年学习毛主席著作现场会议的重要议题。
    会议在分析我国农村当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设的大好形势时指出，目前广大农村青年的革命精神空前高涨，学习毛主席著作的活动从来没有象现在这样广泛。会议认为，我国开始实行第三个五年计划和美帝国主义及其走狗正在疯狂地对我国进行战争挑衅。这种新的形势，对共青团组织提出了更高的要求，这就需要在工作中进一步突出政治，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在团的工作的第一位；用毛泽东思想武装青年，发挥青年在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中的突击作用；教育青年为完成第三个五年计划作出贡献，为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略战争做好准备，在斗争中实现思想革命化。
    这次会议总结了山东省临朐县城关公社李家庄等先进团支部组织青年活学活用毛主席著作的经验（李家庄团支部经验，本报已于一九六五年八月二十九日二版作了介绍）。这些先进团支部的基本经验是：突出政治，把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在团的工作的第一位；坚持理论联系实际的学风，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫；从实际出发，走群众路线。
    参加会议的各地先进团支部的代表和学习积极分子，以大量的事实说明，活学活用毛泽东思想，促使青年思想革命化，是做好一切工作的保证。那里毛泽东思想红旗举得高，那里团的工作就做得好，青年在革命斗争和生产斗争中的作用就突出。那里不突出毛泽东思想，那里团的工作就没有起色，甚至会迷失方向。会议认为，共青团的任务，归根到底就是为革命事业培养接班人，因此，突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，对团的工作具有特殊重要的意义。是不是把活学活用毛泽东思想放在第一位，实质上是用毛泽东思想去教育青年还是用资产阶级思想、封建主义思想教育青年的问题。共青团组织必须坚定不移地在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，以组织青年活学活用毛主席著作为中心，带动团的全部政治思想工作。
    会议总结了一些先进团支部坚持理论联系实际的学风，活学活用毛主席著作，特别是在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验。李家庄等先进团支部学习毛主席著作活动所以取得巨大成效，最根本的是他们逐步明确了学习的目的是为了革命，革主观世界的命，革客观世界的命。在学习中做到学用结合，勤奋地学，认真地用，使学习紧紧跟上革命斗争形势的发展，把学习和革命斗争结合起来，把改造主观世界和改造客观世界结合起来，把组织学习和组织革命实践结合起来。因此，会议强调，当前团组织除了要进一步组织青年学习毛主席的为人民服务思想以外，要着重组织青年学习毛主席关于人民战争的思想、关于帝国主义的有关论述，树立起仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的思想，积极参加练武活动和军事体育活动，随时准备为反对美帝国主义把侵略战争扩大到我国而进行斗争。组织青年学习毛主席关于社会主义时期阶级和阶级斗争的理论，积极参加社会主义教育运动，参加意识形态领域的阶级斗争，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想。组织青年学习毛主席关于自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的指示，坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线，鼓足干劲、力争上游，充当实现第三个五年计划的突击队。
    会上讨论了当前正在深入开展的学习王杰的活动。大家认为，要更好地学习王杰，就应该象王杰那样进一步活学活用毛主席著作。
    在全国农村青年学习毛主席著作活动出现新高潮的情况下，会议强调，组织和指导学习活动要特别注意从实际出发，走群众路线。这就要坚持自觉自愿的原则；善于从当前斗争需要和青年的不同情况和爱好出发，在学习活动的指导上，既抓得紧，又搞得活。抓紧就是抓住不放，反复落实，坚持不懈，不断提高。所谓“活”，就是要领导活，辅导活，特别要引导青年学活、用活。
    会议认为县以上团委要着重做好三项工作。一、抓脱产团干部的学习，特别是团委领导核心的学习，首先使团干部思想革命化，振奋起革命精神。二、抓学习骨干（学习积极分子、团的基层干部、学习辅导员等），从思想上、政治上给以帮助，通过他们带动广大青年学好毛主席著作。三、抓先进典型，既要抓基层团组织的典型，也要抓团员、青年的典型。这是指导学习活动的根本方法，要下决心，用最大的力量去做。
    参加这次会议的有全国各地学习毛主席著作的先进团支部的代表、学习积极分子和各级团干部二百多人。会议期间，代表们参观访问了李家庄和济南部队某部六连、山东省下丁家大队、临沂专区以及这个专区的厉家寨大队、东张屯大队。（附图片）
