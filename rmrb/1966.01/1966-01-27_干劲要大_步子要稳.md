    Currently, on the agricultural front, a nationwide mass movement of learning from Dazhai, catching up with Dazhai, and surpassing Dazhai is being universally launched. At this time, it is very necessary and beneficial to organize the vast rural cadres and commune members to restudy the "National Program for Agricultural Development" once again.
    What is the purpose of launching the 比学赶帮超 (bi xue gan bang chao, compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass) movement on the agricultural front? Generally speaking, it is to promote the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of Dazhai, actively develop agricultural production, and build a new socialist countryside in accordance with the forty articles stipulated in the "National Program for Agricultural Development."
    The "National Program for Agricultural Development" was proposed by the Party Central Committee based on the initiative of Comrade Mao Zedong. This is a great program of struggle for building a new socialist countryside in the present stage, and a program for developing socialist agriculture with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. As written in the preface to the "National Program for Agricultural Development": "This program is a program of struggle for rapidly developing agricultural productive forces during the first to third Five-Year Plans in our country, in order to strengthen our country's socialist industrialization and improve the living standards of peasants and all the people." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhejiang Province put it well: "The 'forty articles' proposed by Chairman Mao are all for the benefit of the peasants"; "'The forty articles' program is a treasure, with goals for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, food, clothing, housing, and everything else." The "Program" fully meets the requirements of the broad masses of peasants and has been warmly supported by them.
    The "National Program for Agricultural Development" emphasizes that developing agriculture occupies an extremely important position in our country's socialist construction. It points out: "Agriculture supplies industry with grain and raw materials, and at the same time, the countryside with a population of over 500 million provides our industry with the world's largest domestic market. From these perspectives, there is no Chinese industry without Chinese agriculture. It is completely wrong to neglect the importance of work in the agricultural sector." Years of practical experience have fully proven the importance of agriculture to the entire national economy; the year agriculture has a bumper harvest is the year life is better. This is a matter of objective law.
    After several years of effort by the vast number of peasants, a number of production teams, communes, districts, counties, and even special districts across the country have reached the targets set by the "Program" in terms of grain output ahead of schedule, and some have even exceeded the targets set by the "Program." However, to realize this program on a national scale, a great deal of work and hard labor is still required.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Being good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at making every movement, every struggle, understood not only by leading cadres but also by the broad masses, and grasped by them, is a Marxist-Leninist art of leadership. Whether our work makes mistakes or not, the boundary line lies here."
    In order to more effectively implement the "National Program for Agricultural Development," Party organizations at the provincial, county, and commune levels must give prominence to politics, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and further educate and mobilize the broad masses of peasants, so that they truly understand the close relationship between achieving and exceeding the "Program's" targets and the revolution, and its close relationship with their own vital interests, that is, to hand over the guidelines to them, hand over the reasoning to them, and hand over the policies to them. As long as the masses are of one mind and act consciously, things will be easy to handle.
    At present, after the socialist education movement, the consciousness of the broad masses of peasants to farm for the revolution has been greatly enhanced, and a unprecedented upsurge of farmland capital construction has emerged throughout the country. Under this favorable situation, the leading organs of the Party at all levels must resolutely adopt the method of the mass line, consult with the masses in everything, and avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and coercion. On the one hand, we must encourage cadres and the broad masses to promote revolutionary vigor, forge ahead bravely, and overcome feelings of fear of difficulty and the idea of doing nothing. On the other hand, we must maintain a clear head, resolutely act in accordance with the Party's policies, and prevent and overcome complacency and impatience.
    Our goal is to reach and exceed the "Program." When, and by what method, each county, each commune, and each team should reach and exceed the "Program" must be based on reality and cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. If it is possible to realize the "Program" in one year, then realize it in one year; if the conditions are not sufficient, then actively create conditions, and if one year is not enough, then two years, and if two years are not enough, then three years, and we must strive to realize and exceed the "Program."
    Our slogan is "Greater drive, steadier steps." When proposing production tasks and production targets, we must adhere to what is actually possible and leave room for maneuver; we must not blindly pursue high targets or forcibly promote measures to increase production. If it is possible to do it, we must do everything possible to achieve it. What cannot be done at present should not be forced.
    Reaching and exceeding the "Program" is a matter for the broad masses of peasants. Only by relying on the masses can this problem be thoroughly solved; as long as we rely on the masses, this problem can be thoroughly solved. Zhejiang, Hunan and other provinces organizing cadres and masses to re-study the "Program" is a good experience in mobilizing the masses to promote a high tide of agricultural production and strive to reach and exceed the "Program" at an early date. Many poor and lower-middle peasants say that we must give full play to our drive to grasp objective laws and to solid work, so that we can take big steps and walk steadily. We must, as Hunan proposed, give full play to our drive and stride forward. Don't be like women with bound feet. However, we must be down-to-earth and take one step at a time, without being impatient. Only in this way can we fully promote and protect the enthusiasm of cadres and the broad masses of peasants, so that agricultural production can develop continuously, healthily, and constantly.
    We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and always be sober promoters.

### 干劲要大　步子要稳

    干劲要大　步子要稳
    目前，在农业战线上，一个学大寨、赶大寨、超大寨的比学赶帮超运动，正在全国普遍开展。在这个时候，组织广大农村干部和社员群众重新学习一次“全国农业发展纲要”，是十分必要的，很有好处的。
    在农业战线上开展比学赶帮超运动的目的是什么呢？总的说来，就是要发扬大寨自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，积极发展农业生产，按照“全国农业发展纲要”规定的四十条，建设社会主义新农村。
      “全国农业发展纲要”是党中央根据毛泽东同志的倡议提出来的。这是现阶段建设社会主义新农村的一个伟大斗争纲领，是一个多快好省地发展社会主义农业的纲领。正如“全国农业发展纲要”序言中所写的：“这个纲要是在我国第一个到第三个五年计划期间，为着迅速发展农业生产力，以便加强我国社会主义工业化、提高农民以及全体人民生活水平的一个斗争纲领。”浙江省的贫农下中农说得好：“毛主席提出的‘四十条’，条条都为农民好”；“‘四十条’纲要是个宝，农林牧副、吃穿住用样样有目标”。“纲要”完全适合广大农民群众的要求，得到广大农民群众的热烈拥护。
    “全国农业发展纲要”强调指出，发展农业在我国社会主义建设中占有极重要的地位。它指出：“农业用粮食和原料供应工业，同时，有五亿以上人口的农村给我国工业提供了世界上的最巨大的国内市场。从这些说来，没有我国的农业，便没有我国的工业。忽视农业方面工作的重要性是完全错误的。”多年来的现实生活，完全证明了农业对整个国民经济的重要性，那一年农业丰收了，那一年的日子就好过。这是一个规律性的问题。
    经过广大农民几年的努力，全国各地已有一批生产队、公社、区、县以至专区，在粮食产量方面，提前达到了“纲要”规定的指标，有的更跨过了“纲要”规定的指标。但是，要在全国范围内实现这个纲要，还要进行大量的工作和艰苦的劳动。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”
    为了更加有效地贯彻执行“全国农业发展纲要”，省、县、社各级党组织，必须突出政治，用毛泽东思想作武器，进一步教育和发动广大农民群众，使他们真正懂得达到和超过“纲要”的指标同革命的密切关系，同自己的切身关系，就是说，把方针交给他们，把道理交给他们，把政策交给他们。只要群众齐心了，自觉地行动起来了，事情就好办了。
    目前，广大农民经过社会主义教育运动，为革命种田的自觉性大大提高，全国出现了空前高涨的农田基本建设的热潮。在这种有利形势之下，各级党的领导机关，要坚决采取群众路线的方法，遇事同群众商量，切忌主观片面和强迫命令。一方面，我们要鼓励干部和广大群众发扬革命干劲，勇往直前，克服畏难情绪和无所作为的思想。另一方面，我们要保持清醒的头脑，坚决按照党的政策办事，防止和克服自满情绪和急躁情绪。
    我们的目标是要达到和超过“纲要”。每个县、每个社、每个队在什么时候、采取什么方法达到和超过“纲要”，必须从实际出发，不能一刀切、一律化。能够一年实现“纲要”的就一年实现；条件不够的就积极创造条件，一年不行两年，两年不行三年，一定要努力争取实现和超过“纲要”。
    我们的口号是“干劲要大，步子要稳”。在提出生产任务和生产指标的时候，一定要按照实际的可能，并且留有余地，不能盲目追求高指标，不能硬性推广增产措施。能够做到的，一定要千方百计争取做到。目前做不到的，就不要勉强去做。
    达到和超过“纲要”，是广大农民群众的事情。只有依靠群众，才能彻底解决这个问题；只要依靠群众，就能彻底解决这个问题。浙江、湖南等省组织干部、群众重新学习“纲要”，是发动群众推进农业生产高潮，争取早日达到和超过“纲要”的好经验。许多贫农下中农说，要把干劲鼓到掌握客观规律上去，鼓到扎扎实实的工作上去，步子才能跨得大，走得稳。我们要象湖南提出的那样，把干劲鼓得足足的，要迈开大步前进，不要做小脚女人。但是，必须脚踏实地，一步一个脚印地走，不能急躁。只有这样，才能充分发扬和保护干部和广大农民的积极性，使农业生产持续地、健康地、不断地向前发展。
    我们要时时记住毛主席的教导，永远作冷静的促进派。
