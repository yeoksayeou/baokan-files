    "Every comrade should be made to understand that the supreme test of the words and deeds of a Communist is whether they conform with the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by the broadest masses of the people."

    Strict Self-Discipline; The Higher Levels Lead, The Lower Levels Follow

    Convenience for oneself, or convenience for the masses? Convenience for the organs, or convenience for the grassroots? Reforming others' "lives," or reforming our own "lives" first?

    Through the Socialist Education Movement, we have come to realize that whether the county committee can thoroughly serve the people depends not only on working diligently but also on whether the issues the county committee considers, the work it undertakes, and the contradictions it resolves are based on the greatest interests of the people. It is not enough for the county committee leadership alone to do this; the entire county-level organs, enterprises, and institutions must also be able to do so. Measured by this requirement, the county committee still has many problems in its understanding and work.

    Recently, the county committee conducted multiple studies on "How to thoroughly serve the people" and studied with cadres from various county-level departments and some commune and team cadres, focusing on five issues for discussion: (1) Starting from one's own convenience or from the convenience of the masses? Starting from the convenience of the organs or from the convenience of the grassroots? (2) Considering the interests of the peasants more, or considering the interests of one's own unit, system, or department more? (3) Should reforms be carried out in a revolutionary way or in a reformist way? (4) Is it to obey the needs of the revolution and resolutely overcome difficulties, or to be timid and constrained by difficulties? (5) Considering only personal gains and losses, or considering the needs of the revolution? The county committee organized everyone to expose problems, find causes, summarize experiences and lessons, and propose solutions. Problems found during discussions were resolved immediately if possible.

    Through discussion, it was found that the county committee leadership had many problems. The prominent ones are insufficient political leadership and weak ideological and political work. In many tasks, the Party committee replaced the administration, and the administration replaced enterprises and institutions. The county committee's leading organs managed many administrative affairs that they should not have managed, and the government's competent departments managed many things that enterprises should have managed. For example, in rural work, the county committee did not concentrate all its efforts on grasping ideological and political work in rural areas and supervising and inspecting the implementation of the Party's various policies in rural areas, but instead replaced the work of administrative departments in many places. Some things that should have been under the government's jurisdiction were handed over to enterprises. Many departments and units had unclear service orientations and had not truly established the concept of facing the countryside and serving the peasants. They considered themselves more than the peasants in their work; they waited for customers to come more than they delivered goods to the countryside; they made it more convenient for themselves than for the peasants. Some commercial units had a purely profit-oriented view, promoting high-end goods more than small commodities. Some procedures in banks were set too cumbersome, which both troubled the masses and constrained productivity. This shows that although the county committee leaders often run around in the countryside, they do not fully understand the demands and opinions of the peasants, nor do they understand how much the county-level departments and units have done for the peasants and how many problems they have solved.

    What should the county committee grasp in order to thoroughly serve the people? After discussion, it was believed that:

    In the future, the county committee's work should mainly focus on six points: (1) Strengthening ideological and political work and implementing the Party's policies; (2) Comprehensively arranging the implementation of national plans and caring for the production and lives of the masses; (3) Grasping Party building and doing a good job in cadre work; (4) Staying at selected spots to labor, conducting investigations and research, summarizing experiences, and using points to guide the whole area; (5) Doing a good job in the people's armed forces; (6) Inspecting and supervising, and adjusting relationships. If these six tasks are grasped well, the county committee's work can highlight politics, use politics to lead the work of various departments and units, and thoroughly serving the people will be guaranteed.

    毛主席语录
    “应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”
                               《论联合政府》
    严以律己　上行下效
    方便自己，还是方便群众？方便机关，还是方便基层？先革别人的“命”，还是先革自己的“命”？
    经过社会主义教育运动，我们认识到：县委能不能彻底为人民服务，仅仅靠辛辛苦苦地工作是不够的，而要看县委想的问题、抓的工作、解决的矛盾，是否从人民的最大利益出发；仅仅县委领导这样做也还不够，还要看整个县级机关、企业事业单位是否也能做到这样。用这个要求来衡量，县委在认识上、工作上还存在不少问题。
    最近，县委就“如何彻底为人民服务”，进行了多次研究，并且与县级各部门干部和部分社、队干部一起学习，集中议论了五个问题：（一）从自己方便出发，还是从群众方便出发？从机关方便出发，还是从基层方便出发？（二）考虑农民利益多，还是考虑本单位、本系统、本部门利益多？（三）改进工作应该采取革命的办法，还是采取改良的办法？（四）是服从革命的需要，坚决克服困难，还是畏首畏尾，为困难所束缚？（五）只考虑个人的得失，还是考虑革命的需要？县委组织大家揭问题，找原因，总结经验教训，提出解决办法。讨论中发现的问题，能解决的就立即解决。
    通过讨论，发现县委领导存在不少问题。突出的是政治挂帅不够，思想政治工作薄弱，许多工作中，形成党委代替了行政，行政代替了企业事业单位。县委领导机关管了许多不应该管的行政事务，政府主管部门管了许多应该企业管的事。例如在农村工作中，县委不是集中全力去抓农村的思想政治工作，督促检查党在农村中各项政策的执行情况，却在很多地方代替了行政部门的工作。也有些本应该归政府管的事却交给了企业。许多部门和单位服务方向不明，没有真正树立起面向农村、为农民服务的观念。工作上为自己着想多，为农民着想少；等客上门多，送货下乡少；方便自己多，方便农民少。有的商业单位有单纯利润观点，推销商品重高档品，轻小商品。银行里有的手续定得过烦，既麻烦群众，又束缚生产力。这说明县委领导干部虽然常在农村跑，但并不十分了解农民的要求和意见，不了解县级各部门、各单位究竟为农民办了多少事，解决了多少问题。
    县委要彻底为人民服务，究竟应该抓什么？经过讨论认为：
    今后县委的工作主要抓住六条：（一）加强思想政治工作，执行党的方针政策；（二）统筹安排国家计划的执行，关心群众的生产、生活；（三）抓好党的建设，做好干部工作；（四）蹲点劳动，调查研究，总结经验，以点带面；（五）搞好人民武装；（六）检查督促，调整关系。这六项工作抓好了，县委的工作就能突出政治，用政治统帅各部门、各单位的工作，彻底为人民服务也就有了保证。
