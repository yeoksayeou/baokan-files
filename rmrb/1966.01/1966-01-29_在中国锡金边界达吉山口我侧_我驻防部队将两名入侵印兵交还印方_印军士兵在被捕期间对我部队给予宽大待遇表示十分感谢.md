    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 28th — Today, on the Chinese side of the Nathu La Pass on the China-Sikkim border, our garrison troops handed over two Indian soldiers, who had intruded into our territory and launched an armed attack against us and were captured alive, to Indian personnel.
    At 14:05 today, Captain Jit S. Bajwa, representing the Indian army, led five Indian soldiers, carrying a green flag, as stipulated in our Foreign Ministry's note to India, to the handover location. Wang Qiang, the representative of our garrison troops, immediately handed over the intruding and captured Indian Sergeant Keshor Man Rai (military number 170087) and Soldier Daljit Singh (military number 170316), along with his medical record, to Captain Jit S. Bajwa, the representative of the Indian army. Captain Jit S. Bajwa checked each item and signed the handover list in acknowledgment.
    These two Indian soldiers, along with more than thirty other Indian soldiers, intruded into our territory at the Nathu La Pass on the China-Sikkim border on December 12 of last year and were captured alive when they launched an armed attack against our border patrol personnel. Considering that these two Indian soldiers truthfully admitted, after being captured, the process and error of launching the offensive across the border under the orders of their superiors, our government decided to treat them leniently in accordance with the consistent spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism and return them to the Indian side today.
    At 14:10, all handover procedures were completed. As the two Indian personnel left our country's border, they shook hands with the personnel of our garrison troops one by one to express their gratitude. After leaving the border, they repeatedly turned back to wave to the personnel of our garrison troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 28th — The two Indian soldiers who were captured alive on December 12 of last year in our territory at the Nathu La Pass on the China-Sikkim border, after launching an armed attack against our border patrol personnel, expressed their deep gratitude for the lenient treatment given to them by our border defense troops.
    During their capture, our border defense troops not only respected their dignity and did not confiscate their private belongings but also provided them with good care in their daily lives.
    Indian Sergeant Keshor Man Rai, who was captured alive by us, was originally wearing thin clothing. Our border defense personnel immediately issued him a woolen undershirt, cotton clothes, cotton shoes, a cotton hat, and a cotton quilt, and arranged for him to live in a warm and bright room. Now, he is rosy-cheeked and in good spirits. When reporters recently asked him about his life after being captured, he said happily, "I eat well, dress well, sleep well, and play well."
    Indian Soldier Daljit Singh, who was captured alive by us, was seriously injured in the armed attack against our border patrol personnel, and also suffered frostbite. After being captured, he has been staying in the hospital and receiving meticulous treatment. Now, his gunshot wound has basically healed, and the frostbite on his hands and feet has also greatly improved. When he met with reporters recently, he said happily, "Chinese doctors and nurses have taken very good care of me. They have made the best and greatest efforts to heal my wounds. I am very grateful to Chinese friends for being so lenient to me!"

    在中国锡金边界达吉山口我侧
    我驻防部队将两名入侵印兵交还印方
    印军士兵在被捕期间对我部队给予宽大待遇表示十分感谢
    新华社拉萨二十八日电  今天，在中国锡金边界达吉山口我侧，我驻防部队把侵入我国境内向我发动武装进攻被活捉的两名印军士兵，交还给印方人员。
    今天十四时五分，印军代表吉·斯·巴洁瓦上尉率领印军五人，按照我国外交部照会印方的规定，打着绿旗一面，来到交接地点。我驻防部队代表王强当即把入侵被捕的印军中士克索尔曼·拉依（军号一七○○八七）、士兵达立特·辛格（军号一七○三一六）和他的病历表，一并交还给印军代表吉·斯·巴洁瓦上尉。吉·斯·巴洁瓦上尉一一点收后，在交接清单上签字认领。
    这两名印军士兵，是去年十二月十二日同其他三十余名印军一起，侵入中锡边界达吉山口我国境内，向我边防值勤人员发动武装进攻时被我活捉的。我国政府考虑到这两名印军士兵被捕以后，如实承认了他们奉上级的命令越境发动进攻的经过和错误，决定本着一贯的革命人道主义精神，对他们宽大处理，并于今天交还印方。
    十四时十分，交接手续全部办完。两名印军人员在离开我国国境时，与我驻防部队人员一一握手，表示感谢。他们离境后，还不断回过身来向我驻防部队人员招手致意。
    新华社拉萨二十八日电去年十二月十二日在中锡边界达吉山口我国境内，向我边防值勤人员发动武装进攻被活捉的两名印军士兵，对我边防部队给予他们的宽大待遇，表示十分感激。
    这两名印军士兵在被捕期间，我边防部队不但尊重他们的人格，不没收他们的私人财物，而且在生活上给予他们良好照顾。
    被我活捉的印军中士克索尔曼·拉依，原来穿的服装单薄，我边防人员当即发给他绒衣、棉衣、棉鞋、棉帽和棉被，并安排他住在一间温暖而明亮的房子里。现在，他红光满面，精神很好。当记者最近问到他被捕后的生活情况时，他愉快地说：“我吃得好、穿得好、睡得好、玩得也好。”
    被我活捉的印军士兵达立特·辛格，在向我边防值勤人员发动武装进攻时受伤较重，另外还有冻伤。被捕后，一直住在医院里，得到细心的治疗。现在，他的枪伤伤口已基本愈合，手脚的冻伤也大大好转。最近他同记者见面时高兴地说：“中国医生和护士对我的照顾很好。他们为治好我的伤，作了最好最大的努力。中国朋友对我这样宽大，我表示非常感谢！”
