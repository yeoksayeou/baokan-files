    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th – The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army sent an urgent telegram to the International Commission in Vietnam on the 3rd, strongly protesting the bloody crimes of the US imperialists instigating South Korean puppet troops to barbarously massacre the South Vietnamese people.

    The telegram listed in detail the atrocities of the South Korean puppet troops: On December 22nd of last year, South Korean puppet troops, acting on the orders of their American masters, carried out a "sweep" of Xinjiang Village, Fuhua Township, Suifu County, Pingding Province, South Vietnam. They implemented fascist tactics such as "kill all, burn all," and brutally massacred fifty peaceful residents, including more than forty women and children, including three pregnant women. They also burned all the houses. The telegram pointed out that this is a new and extremely barbarous crime committed by the South Korean puppet troops after a series of heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors and their running dogs against the South Vietnamese people.

    The telegram said that to date, the South Korean authorities, following US orders, have sent nearly 20,000 South Korean puppet troops into South Vietnam to serve the US policy of "using Asians to fight Asians" and to intensify the US war of aggression in the region.

    The telegram pointed out that the bloody crimes committed by the South Korean puppet troops in South Vietnam under the command of the United States can only further arouse the Vietnamese people's bitter hatred of the US imperialist aggressors.

    The telegram emphasized that the main culprit who sent US troops and their puppet troops to the South, committing heinous crimes in the South—the US imperialist aggressors—must bear full responsibility for the consequences of the South Korean puppet troops' barbarous massacre. The American running dog, the Park Chung-hee clique, obviously cannot escape the severe condemnation of world public opinion.

    The telegram finally demanded that the Johnson government stop the war of aggression in South Vietnam and immediately withdraw all US troops and their puppet troops, and all US weapons and war tools from South Vietnam.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th – The Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* published a commentary on the 6th, condemning the US imperialists for instigating South Korean puppet troops to massacre fifty peaceful residents in South Vietnam on December 22nd of last year, and calling on the South Korean people to wage a resolute struggle against the Park Chung-hee clique's dispatch of troops to South Vietnam, and to demand the immediate recall of all puppet troops sent to South Vietnam.

    The commentary warned that the South Korean puppet troops, acting as tools of the American aggressors and antagonizing the South Vietnamese people, will certainly not escape the severe punishment of the South Vietnamese people.

    抗议美帝指使南朝鲜仆从屠杀南越人民
    朝鲜报纸谴责南朝鲜伪军在南越的暴行
    新华社河内四日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团三日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会，强烈抗议美帝国主义指使南朝鲜仆从军野蛮屠杀越南南方人民的血腥罪行。
    电报详细地列举了南朝鲜仆从军的暴行：去年十二月二十二日，南朝鲜仆从军按照美国主子的命令，到南越平定省绥福县福和乡新江村“扫荡”时，实行“杀光、烧光”等法西斯手段，残暴地屠杀了五十名和平居民，其中四十多名是妇女和儿童，并有三名孕妇，他们还烧光了所有房屋。电报指出，这是南朝鲜仆从军继美国侵略者及其走狗对南越人民制造的一系列滔天罪行之后的又一个新的极其野蛮的罪行。
    电报说，到目前为止，南朝鲜当局追随美国的命令，把将近二万名南朝鲜仆从军开进了南越，为美国的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策和强化美国在这个地区进行的侵略战争服务。
    电报指出，在美国的指挥下，南朝鲜仆从军在南越犯下的血腥罪行只能更加激起越南人民对美帝国主义侵略者的刻骨仇恨。
    电报强调指出，把美军和它的仆从军开进南方，在南方犯下滔天罪行的主要凶手——美帝国主义侵略者，必须对南朝鲜仆从军的野蛮屠杀行动所产生的后果承担全部责任。美帝国主义的走狗——朴正熙集团显然也逃避不了世界舆论的严厉谴责。
    电报最后要求约翰逊政府停止在越南南方进行的侵略战争，把一切美军及其仆从军，和美国的一切武器和战争工具立即撤出越南南方。
    新华社平壤六日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》六日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义指使南朝鲜伪军在去年十二月二十二日屠杀越南南方五十名和平居民的罪行，并且号召南朝鲜人民为反对朴正熙集团派遣军队到越南南方，为要求立即召还派往越南南方的所有伪军而进行坚决斗争。
    评论警告说，南朝鲜伪军充当美国侵略者的工具，与越南南方人民为敌，一定逃脱不了越南南方人民的严厉惩罚。
