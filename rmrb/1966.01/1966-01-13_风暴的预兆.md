    Harbinger of Storms
    Black people in the cities of Birmingham and Tuskegee in Alabama, USA, have held demonstrations against racial discrimination for days, despite police obstruction. These peals of spring thunder ringing out from the American South presage a new surge in the American black movement in the new year.
    Since the black people of Los Angeles, USA, launched a vigorous anti-violence struggle in August last year, the tide of struggle against racial discrimination among black masses in various parts of the United States has risen and fallen. Although the Johnson administration pretends to be calm, it is in fact worried about when and where a new storm of struggle will break out. Johnson once publicly admitted that the situation of the vast majority of American blacks is very bad, admitting that they are "another nation" that has been "deprived of freedom," then of course he cannot expect the broad masses of American blacks not to fight for their own liberation. An official American report believes that the August anti-violence struggle "will only be a prelude to events that may erupt someday in the future," which is not without reason.
    What particularly worries the Washington ruling clique is that the American black people's struggle against racial discrimination is increasingly converging with the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam. According to a recent report in the British *Sunday Times*, the Vietnam issue and the black issue have put Johnson in a distressing predicament, and he has to "devote all his energy and wisdom" to deal with these "two explosive issues." However, it is clear that Johnson cannot cope with these two issues even if he exhausts all his energy and "wisdom."
    A new upsurge in the American black struggle is bound to come. The awakened black masses will write new chapters for their liberation movement.

### 风暴的预兆

    风暴的预兆
    美国亚拉巴马州伯明翰和杜斯克基两城市的黑人，连日不顾警察的阻挠，举行反对种族歧视的示威游行。从美国南部响起的这一声声春雷，预示着在新的一年中美国黑人运动将出现新的高涨。
    自从去年八月间美国洛杉矶的黑人掀起轰轰烈烈的抗暴斗争之后，美国各地的黑人群众反对种族歧视的斗争浪潮一直是此伏彼起。约翰逊政府虽然假装镇静，事实上它对于什么时候在什么地方将会爆发新的斗争风暴是忧心忡忡的。约翰逊曾经公开承认绝大多数美国黑人的处境很糟，承认他们是“被剥夺了自由”的“另一个国家”，那末他就当然不能指望美国广大的黑人群众会不为自己的解放而斗争。美国的一份官方报告，认为八月抗暴斗争“将不过是将来有一天可能爆发的事件的序幕”，这并不是没有道理的。
    特别使得华盛顿统治集团担忧的是，美国黑人的反对种族歧视斗争，正日益同美国人民的反对侵越战争的运动汇合起来。据英国的《星期日泰晤士报》最近报道，越南问题和黑人问题使约翰逊陷入苦恼的困境，他不得不“拿出全部精力和智慧”来应付这“两个爆炸性问题”。但是，很显然，这两个问题，是约翰逊竭尽他的全部精力和“智慧”都应付不了的。
    美国黑人斗争的新高涨一定要到来。已经觉醒的黑人群众将为他们的解放运动写出新的篇章。
