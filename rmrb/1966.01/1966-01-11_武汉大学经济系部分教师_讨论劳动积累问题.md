    Wuhan University Economics Department Faculty
    Discuss Labor Accumulation Issues
    Recently, some faculty members of the Economics Department of Wuhan University held a discussion on the issue of labor accumulation in the collective economy. A brief overview of the discussion is as follows:
  The scale, speed, and development trend of labor accumulation
    One opinion is that the essence of studying the scale and speed of labor accumulation is how to fully utilize labor resources in the collective economy, and how to reasonably allocate labor between current production and capital construction, so as to ensure that capital construction can develop rapidly without affecting the development of current production. The scale and speed of labor accumulation depend on objective needs and subjective possibilities. Objective needs refer to the production conditions of a commune or team. Different communes and teams with different production conditions have different needs for labor accumulation. Subjective possibilities refer to the amount of surplus labor after meeting the current labor needs for production. In particular, the ratio of labor for production and labor for capital construction is the key to determining the scale and speed of labor accumulation.
    Another opinion is that it cannot be unilaterally said that the worse the production conditions of a commune or team, the greater the need for labor accumulation. It can only be said that the amount of labor accumulation in the past determines the need for labor accumulation in the future. It should be seen that humanity's transformation of nature will be infinite, and changing the backwardness of China's agriculture is not something that can be done in a day. Not only is it necessary to engage in labor accumulation before agricultural modernization, but it is also necessary to engage in labor accumulation during agricultural modernization. Even if agricultural modernization is initially realized, there are still many tasks that need to be carried out to change natural conditions, and it is still necessary to engage in labor accumulation.
    Yet another opinion is that with the gradual realization of agricultural modernization, agricultural labor productivity will gradually increase, and the labor required for production may decrease accordingly, thus making it possible to increase the labor used for capital construction accordingly. Therefore, the development trend of labor accumulation may also be that its absolute amount will not decrease.
            The relationship between labor accumulation and capital accumulation
    One opinion is that communes and teams with poor production conditions and large labor potential can first engage in more labor accumulation to promote capital accumulation. Conversely, communes and teams with good production conditions and little labor potential should focus on capital accumulation to gradually realize agricultural modernization, and labor accumulation can be reduced.
    Another opinion is that although the scale of labor accumulation in different regions can be different, from the general situation at present, all communes and teams need to engage in more labor accumulation. By engaging in more labor accumulation to change natural conditions and production conditions, and improve agricultural labor productivity, it will increase agricultural product output, which will also be conducive to capital accumulation.

    武汉大学经济系部分教师
    讨论劳动积累问题
    最近，武汉大学经济学系部分教师就集体经济中的劳动积累问题，举行了讨论会。现将讨论情况简介如下。
  劳动积累的规模、速度及发展趋势
    一种意见认为，研究劳动积累规模、速度问题的实质，是怎样充分利用集体经济中的劳动资源，如何在当前生产与基本建设之间合理地分配劳动力，以保证基本建设在不影响当前生产发展的前提下得到较快的发展。劳动积累的规模和速度，取决于客观需要与主观可能。客观需要指的是一个社、队的生产条件。不同生产条件的社、队对劳动积累的需要量是不相同的。主观可能指的是满足当前生产用工需要后的那一部分剩余劳动的数量。特别是生产用工与基本建设用工的比例，是决定劳动积累规模、速度的关键。
    另一种意见认为，不能片面地说生产条件越差的社、队，劳动积累的需要量越多。只能说原先劳动积累量的多少，决定今后劳动积累的需要量。应当看到，人类改造自然将会是无限的，要改变我国农业落后的面貌更不是一日之功。不仅在进行农业现代化前要搞劳动积累，在进行农业现代化过程中也要搞劳动积累，即使初步实现了农业现代化，所需要进行改变自然条件方面的任务还很多，还是需要搞劳动积累。
    再有一种意见认为，随着农业现代化的逐步实现，农业劳动生产率逐步提高，生产用工可能相应减少，从而使基本建设用工有可能相应增多。因此，劳动积累的发展趋势也可能是它的绝对量不会减少。
            劳动积累与资金积累的关系
    一种意见认为，目前生产条件差，劳动潜力大的社、队，可以首先多搞劳动积累，以促进资金积累。反之，目前生产条件好、劳动潜力不大的社、队，则应当着重考虑资金积累，以逐步实现农业现代化，劳动积累可以少搞点。
    另一种意见认为，虽然不同条件地区的劳动积累的规模，可以有所不同，但是，从目前一般情况看来，各个社、队都需要多搞点劳动积累。通过多搞点劳动积累来改变自然条件、生产条件，提高农业劳动生产率，以增加农产品产量，从而也就有利于资金积累。
