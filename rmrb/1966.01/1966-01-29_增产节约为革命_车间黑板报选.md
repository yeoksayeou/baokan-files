    Increasing Production and Practicing Economy is Revolution
    Selections from Workshop Blackboards
    One Step, One Peak
    Shi Yuxin
    Good news shines red in the sky,
    Spring tide surges everywhere.
    Stepping onto a new starting point,
    Strive to be the vanguard.
    A bright lamp shines in the heart,
    Endless strength throughout the body.
    Factories learn from Daqing,
    New customs are promoted everywhere.
    Enemies are in our minds,
    Practice the skill to kill the enemy diligently.
    Combine labor and military affairs,
    The country will be red for generations.
    The pace sounds loud and clear,
    One step, one peak.
    The hero stands on the summit, singing "The East is Red".

    The "Thoughtful Person" for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Shen Lan
    The steel turning forks used in the First Hot Rolling Workshop used to require more than thirty pieces each month, but recently they have been greatly reduced. What's going on?
    The thing is this: Zhang Wenhai, the pipeline team leader of the mechanical department, was inspecting equipment in Workshop 1 when he noticed that the steel turning workers were holding steel turning forks, turning steel plates in a furnace of over 1000 degrees one moment, and putting them into a water tank to cool the next. He thought: this operation consumes a lot of steel turning forks and requires high labor intensity; it would be great if we could innovate! Thinking of this, he thought of the heating furnace, where the temperature is as high as over 1000 degrees, but because two pipes inside the furnace are connected to water, it is not easy to soften. If two holes could be opened on the steel turning fork as well, sending water in from one end and out from the other, this would not only achieve cooling but also allow for long-term operation inside the furnace. He told his idea to all the comrades in the team, and everyone actively supported it. They used their spare time to find some waste materials, and after a few days of hard work, the innovation was successful and the effect was good after operation. In the past, more than thirty steel turning forks were scrapped each month, but now it has been reduced to about ten!
    This tells us that as long as you are a "thoughtful person," you can find the potential for increasing production and practicing economy.

    Twisted into a Noose to Strangle the Enemy
    Wang Yumin
    Steel plates turned like flowing clouds,
    "Thousandth card" measures quickly and accurately.
    Hands wear "blooming" broken gloves,
    Taking the lead in increasing production and practicing economy.
    Chairman Mao's words are dearest to hear,
    "Practice strict economy" is kept in mind.
    Patches are sewn on gloves,
    Practicing diligence and economy is revolution.
    Think of Lei Feng's torn socks,
    Who were they mended for, with thousands of patches?
    Today we mend gloves,
    Learning from Lei Feng's good style.
    See that half of the globe is dark,
    The burden of revolution weighs a thousand pounds.
    Saving cloth by the foot on gloves,
    Twisted into a noose to strangle the enemy.

    Design Revolutionization
    Jiang Shude
    Industry is the leader,
    Machine tools are treasures.
    Developing high precision,
    Is what the country needs most.
    Read Chairman Mao's books well,
    Dare to think and dare to break through,
    Break the foreign frameworks,
    And create new grinders.
    More and better grinders,
    High production level.
    Accelerate catching up and surpassing,
    The motherland is more beautiful!

    增产节约为革命
    车间黑板报选
    一步一座峰
    史玉新
    捷报映天红，
    春潮遍地涌。
    迈步新起点，
    争当急先锋。
    明灯照在胸，
    浑身力无穷。
    厂厂学大庆，
    处处扬新风。
    脑中有敌情，
    苦练杀敌功。
    劳武相结合，
    江山万代红。
    步伐响咚咚，
    一步一座峰。
     英雄站峰顶，高唱《东方红》。

    增产节约的“有心人”
    沈岚
    第一热轧车间用的翻钢叉，过去每个月需要三十多把，最近却大大减少了。这是怎么回事呢？
    事情是这样的：机动科管道组长张文海，一次在一车间检修设备，他发现翻钢工手里拿的翻钢叉，一忽儿在一千多度的炉子内翻钢板，一忽儿就放到水箱里冷却。他想：这样操作，翻钢叉耗用大，劳动强度也高；如果能革新一下，该有多好啊！想到这里，他联想到加热炉，温度高达一千多度，但由于炉内两根管子通水，因此不易软化。如果翻钢叉上也开两个洞，一头送水进去，一头出水，这样就既可以得到冷却，又可以在炉内长时间的操作。他把自己的想法告诉了全组同志，大家一听都积极支持。他们利用了空隙时间，找来了一些废旧材料，经过几天努力，革新成功，操作后效果良好。过去每月要报废三十多把翻钢叉，现在减少到十把左右了！
    这件事告诉我们，只要是“有心人”，就能找到增产节约的潜力。

    扭成绞索勒敌人
    王育民
    钢板翻得象流云，
    “千分卡”量得快又准。
    手带“开花”破手套，
    增产节约打头阵。
    主席话儿最爱听，
    “厉行节约”记在心。
    手套上面打补钉，
    勤俭节约为革命。
    想想雷锋破袜子，
    千补万纳为何人？
    今天我们补手套，
    学习雷锋好作风。
    眼看地球半边暗，
    革命担子重千斤。
    节约手套尺尺布，
    扭成绞索勒敌人。

    设计革命化
    姜树德
    工业是主导，
    机床是珍宝。
    发展高精尖，
    国家最需要。
    读好主席书，
    敢想又敢闯，
    打破洋框框，
    造出新磨床。
    磨床好又多，
    生产水平高。
    加快赶和超，
    祖国更美好！
