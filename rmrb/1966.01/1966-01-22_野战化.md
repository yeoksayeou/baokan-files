    “Field-ization”
    Worker of the First Metallurgical Construction Company  Xia Baochai
    "Field-ization" is an important "ization" for our construction teams and a combat requirement for our "field army." We must not only have the fighting style of going wherever we are directed and winning, but also the ability to fight under difficult conditions and the habit of living in harsh environments. That is: leaving our hometown and parting from our loved ones, without worries, fighting across the world, invincible; stationed in deep mountains and remote areas, willingly; braving rain, snow, and scorching sun, as if it were normal.
    To achieve "field-ization," we must first revolutionize our thinking, starting with studying Chairman Mao's works. Repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," eradicate individualistic thoughts, establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people, and use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to conquer difficulties and transform the objective world.
    Our motherland is vast, and there are more cities waiting for us to build, and vast lands waiting for us to beautify. In the world, two-thirds of the working people are still suffering. Therefore, we must establish a revolutionary spirit of having the whole world in mind, looking towards the world, overcoming all difficulties, and fearing no sacrifice, and fight tenaciously for the early realization of communism and the liberation of all mankind, and become a glorious fighter of a truly "field-ized" field army!

    “野战化”
    第一冶金建设公司工人  夏宝才
    “野战化”，这是我们建设队伍的重要一“化”，是我们“野战军”的战斗需要。我们不但要有指到哪里打到哪里的战斗作风，而且要有在困难条件下战斗的能力，在艰苦环境中生活的习惯。也就是：离故乡别亲人，无虑无忧，战天涯斗海角，战无不胜；驻深山扎野岭，心甘情愿；披雨雪顶烈日，习以为常。
    要实现“野战化”还得首先思想革命化，从学习毛主席著作入手。反复学习《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》三篇毛主席著作，铲除个人主义思想，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，用愚公移山的精神，征服困难，改造客观世界。
    我们的祖国土地辽阔，还有更多的城市等待我们去建设，还有广大的土地等待我们去美化；世界上，还有三分之二的劳苦人民受苦受难。因此，我们必须树立起胸怀全球、眼望世界、排除万难、不怕牺牲的革命精神，为早日实现共产主义和全人类的解放顽强战斗，当一名真正的“野战化”了的野战军的光荣战士！
