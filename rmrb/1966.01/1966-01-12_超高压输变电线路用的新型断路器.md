    New Type of Circuit Breaker for Ultra-High Voltage Power Transmission Lines
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) A fully inflated 220,000-volt air circuit breaker, used in ultra-high voltage power transmission lines, has recently been successfully trial-produced by employees of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory. This is a new achievement in the manufacturing technology of China's high-voltage electrical appliance industry.
    Circuit breakers are control and protection devices used in transmission lines. Fully inflated air circuit breakers have only appeared internationally in the last decade. Compared with the oil circuit breakers of the same voltage level produced by this factory in the past, this new 220,000-volt air circuit breaker has the advantages of large capacity, fast action, small size, light weight, and small installation area. Its weight is one-ninth of that of a multi-oil circuit breaker, which can save a lot of transformer oil and metal materials.
    This new type of circuit breaker was designed by the employees of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory and successfully trial-produced after more than 3,000 experiments and solving a series of technical problems. The materials used are entirely domestic.
    The appraisal committee jointly formed by the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power believes that this air circuit breaker has an advanced structure and lays the foundation for the development of higher voltage level circuit breakers in China. Small-batch production will begin this year.

    超高压输变电线路用的新型断路器
    据新华社沈阳电　用在超高压输变电线路上的全充气式二十二万伏空气断路器，最近由沈阳高压开关厂职工试制成功。这是我国高压电器工业制造技术的一个新的成就。
    断路器是用在输变电线路上的控制保护装置。全充气式的空气断路器是近十年才在国际上出现的。这种新的二十二万伏空气断路器，与这个厂过去生产的同电压等级的油断路器比较，具有容量大、动作快、体积小、重量轻、安装占地面积少等优点。它的重量相当于多油断路器的九分之一，可节约大量变压器油和金属材料。
    这种新型断路器是沈阳高压开关厂职工自行设计并且经过三千多次试验，解决了一系列技术难题以后才试制成功的。采用的材料完全是国产。
    经第一机械工业部、水利电力部联合组成的鉴定委员会鉴定认为：这种空气断路器结构先进，为我国发展更高电压等级的断路器奠定了基础。从今年开始小批生产。
