    This newspaper reports Third Five-Year Plan had just begun, Zhang Shaolin, a famous labor model in Shenyang City and a technical innovation expert at the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory, and his partners achieved initial success by manufacturing a specialized piece of equipment—a beveling machine. This equipment is highly efficient. With the push of a button, it can bevel both sides of a thick steel plate in just over ten minutes. Previously, the beveling process required two strong workers using pneumatic chisels to chip away for more than an hour. With this specialized equipment, production efficiency has increased two to three times.

    Starting in 1958, when Zhang Shaolin used scrap materials to create his first piece of indigenous equipment—a small stamping machine—his group has implemented more than 500 innovations, both large and small, over the past seven years. Eighty percent of the work has been mechanized or semi-mechanized, transforming the original riveting and welding workshop with 164 workers into a riveting and welding team of only 43 people. Furthermore, they have successfully completed production tasks that have increased year after year.

    Zhang Shaolin's persistence in implementing technological innovation is not because he is particularly clever or more knowledgeable than others. He has never attended school. He entered a capitalist factory as an apprentice at the age of fifteen and is now forty-nine years old. In his own words: "My technical innovation relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Over the past seven years, the more he studies Chairman Mao's works, the more open-minded he becomes, the clearer his work objectives are, the more energetic he is in innovation, the wider the path he treads, and the more methods he discovers. When encountering difficulties, he compares himself to Yu Gong in perseverance; when facing challenging technical problems, he compares himself to Bethune in his meticulous attitude towards technology; when facing conflicts with personal interests, he compares himself to Zhang Side in his dedication to the revolution. He says: As long as these three serve as role models, there is no technological innovation that cannot be achieved.

    Under Zhang Shaolin's leadership, many workers in the riveting and welding team have become innovation experts. Recently, based on the production characteristics of this year, they proposed eight technical innovations. Currently, the first specialized equipment, the beveling machine, has been put into production, and another piece of indigenous equipment, an abrasive wheel cutter, has also been put into production. The other six are actively being pursued. (Attached image)

### 沈阳市劳动模范张绍林谈体会  技术革新靠的是毛泽东思想  他和小组同志七年来共实现了大小革新五百多项

    沈阳市劳动模范张绍林谈体会
    技术革新靠的是毛泽东思想
    他和小组同志七年来共实现了大小革新五百多项
    本报讯  第三个五年计划刚一开始，沈阳市的著名劳动模范、沈阳气体压缩机厂技术革新能手张绍林和他的伙伴们旗开得胜，制造成功一台专用设备——刨坡机。这台设备工作效率很高，只要一按电钮，十几分钟的工夫，便把一张厚钢板的两边刨成了坡形，过去刨坡这道工序得要两个强体力的工人，替换着用风铲“哒哒”地铲上一个多小时。有了这台专用设备，生产效率提高了两三倍。
    从张绍林在一九五八年用废旧材料做成第一台土设备——小型冲压机开始，七年来，他的小组已经实现了大小革新五百多项，有百分之八十的活实现了机械化和半机械化，使原来拥有一百六十四个人的铆焊工段，变成了现在只有四十三人的铆焊小组，而且圆满地完成了年年都有增加的生产任务。
    张绍林坚持实行技术革新，并不是因为他比别人特别聪明，比别人特别有学问。他，没念过一天书，十五岁就进了资本家的工厂当学徒，如今已是四十九岁的人了。用他自己的话来说：“我搞技术革新，靠的是毛泽东思想。”七年来，他越学习毛主席著作，思想越开阔，工作的目的越明确，革新的劲头越充足，路子越走越宽，办法越来越多。遇到困难，他就与愚公比恒心；遇到不易钻研的技术难题，他就与白求恩比对技术精益求精的态度；遇到与个人利益矛盾的时候，他就与张思德比对革命的贡献。他说：只要有这三个人做榜样，就没有实现不了的技术革新。
    在张绍林的带动下，铆焊组许多工人都变成了革新能手。最近，他们根据今年的生产特点，提出了八项技术革新。现在，第一台专用设备刨坡机已投入生产，另一台土设备砂轮切割器也投入了生产，另外六项正在积极进行。（附图片）
