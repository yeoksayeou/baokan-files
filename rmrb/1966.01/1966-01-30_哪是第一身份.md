    Which is the Primary Identity?
    Leading comrades from the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce had the following dialogue with company managers:
    "Between Party member and manager, which is your primary identity?"
    "Party member is the primary identity."
    "What 'rice' does a Communist Party member eat?"
    "Political rice."
    "Since that is the case, why aren't you grasping politics?"
    This question and answer clarified for the managers that business leaders must engage in political work.
    What is one's primary identity? This is a question that every Party member leading cadre in the financial and trade sectors should seriously consider.
    "Managers, managers, just manage operations." "Departments manage business, local authorities manage politics." "Ideological and political work is the business of political cadres." It seems that business leading cadres have no responsibility for grasping political work.
    These arguments are specious. Business leading cadres and political work cadres have a division of labor, and the work of business departments and local Party committees are not entirely the same. However, conducting ideological and political work among the masses, and educating the people with Mao Zedong Thought, is the responsibility of the entire Party and a common task of all departments. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All departments must be responsible for ideological and political work. The Communist Party should manage it, the Communist Youth League should manage it, the competent government departments should manage it..." Why should business departments like the provincial departments, bureaus, and companies be the only ones who shouldn't manage it? Since ideological and political work is the task of the entire Party, why can Communist Party members who become department heads, bureau chiefs, and managers be the only ones who don't have to manage it?
    In the final analysis, some Party member comrades who have become business leading cadres have forgotten their identity as political fighters. Communist Party members are engaged in politics, in class struggle. No matter what position they hold, no matter what kind of business work they are engaged in, they must carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology on the political, economic, and ideological fronts. This requires highlighting politics and doing ideological and political work in the work process. Whoever forgets this is not a good Communist Party member.
    As for some managers who are not Party members, the leading comrades of the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce talked to them like this: Although you are not Party members, you are managers of socialist, publicly owned enterprises under the leadership of the Communist Party. This specific identity cannot be forgotten.
    Yes. Every manager in our new society is a manager of a socialist enterprise and shoulders the task of socialist revolution. Whoever forgets this is lowering themselves to the level of merchants in the old society. As a revolutionary cadre shouldering the important task of promoting socialism and eliminating capitalism, how can they not consciously engage in ideological and political work?!

    哪是第一身份
    湖北省商业厅的领导同志，同公司经理们进行过这样一段对话：
    党员和经理，哪是你的第一身份？
    党员是第一身份。
    共产党员是吃什么饭的？
    吃政治饭。
    既然如此，为什么不抓政治？
    这样一问一答，使经理们对于业务领导干部必须做政治工作有了更明确的认识。
    什么是自己的第一身份？这个问题值得财贸部门的每个党员领导干部认真地想一想。
    “经理，经理，就管经营管理。”“条条管业务，块块管政治。”“思想政治工作，是政治干部的事。”说来说去，业务领导干部似乎在抓政治工作方面毫无责任。
    这些论调都是似是而非的。业务领导干部和政治工作干部要有分工，业务部门和地方党委工作不尽相同。但是，向群众进行思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想教育人民，这是全党的责任，是各个部门的共同任务。毛泽东同志说：“思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。共产党应该管，青年团应该管，政府主管部门应该管……。”为什么唯独厅、局、公司等业务部门不应该管呢？既然思想政治工作是全党的任务，为什么唯独当了厅长、局长、经理的共产党员就可以不管呢？
    说到底，是一部分当了业务领导干部的党员同志，忘记了自己是政治战士这一身份。共产党员就是搞政治的，就是搞阶级斗争的。无论担负什么职务，无论从事何种业务工作，都要在政治、经济和思想战线上进行兴无灭资的斗争。这就要在工作过程中突出政治，做思想政治工作。谁要忘记了这一点，谁就不是一个好的共产党员。
    至于一部分不是党员的经理，湖北省商业厅的领导同志是这样跟他们谈的：你们虽然不是党员，但是共产党领导下的、社会主义社会的、全民所有制企业的经理。这个特定的身份不能忘记。
    是的。我们新社会的每一个经理，都是社会主义企业的经理，都担负着社会主义革命的任务。谁要忘记了这一点，就是把自己降低到旧社会的买卖人的水平。作为一个担负着兴社会主义、灭资本主义的重任的革命干部，怎么能不自觉地去进行思想政治工作呢？！
