    Editor's Note: Comrade Wang Jinxi, the "Iron Man" of Daqing, has given a speech that is worthy of being read by all comrades. Comrade Wang Jinxi's speech is a good teaching material permeated with proletarian revolutionary thought and revolutionary feelings.
    In Daqing, "Iron Man" is no longer the heroic act of a few individuals, but the common revolutionary characteristic of the majority of people. "Iron Man Spirit" is the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese working class, under the leadership of our Party, fighting against the heavens, fighting against the earth, fighting against class enemies, and fighting against erroneous ideas. Everyone strives to be an "Iron Man," everyone learns the "Iron Man Spirit," and this is one of the main reasons why Daqing Oilfield has been built into a socialist and revolutionized enterprise in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    Learning from Daqing, for every enterprise's workers, means learning from Daqing's "Iron Man" and becoming a "Iron Man"-style revolutionary fighter. If an enterprise has more "Iron Men," and they occupy an overwhelming advantage, then that enterprise will become a Daqing-style unit.
    From Comrade Wang Jinxi's speech, we can also learn the language of the working people. This speech uses simple and vivid language to express love for the Party, for Chairman Mao, and for the people's revolutionary cause. There is none of the common student-like style. Every sentence is decisive and straightforward; it says what it does and does what it says. This point is also worth learning.

    Hard Bone
    I used to work in Yumen Oilfield. In March 1960, we came to Daqing with the ambitious goal of taking down a large oilfield, getting rid of the backward label of the petroleum industry, and winning glory for the motherland.
    I was extremely happy to hear the news of the oilfield discovery! For many years, I had been thinking, when will our country find a large oilfield? At that time, I was extremely anxious, thinking only of participating in the battle to conquer the oilfield. At the thought of our country's backward petroleum industry and the lack of oil, who in the oil industry could sit still? I couldn't wait to take down the large oilfield in one breath and throw the backward label of petroleum into the Pacific Ocean! At that time, the leading comrades of Yumen told us that the battle had just begun, and there would be many difficulties. We said: We are not afraid! The imperialists scold us, and the revisionists cut us off, but we must stand tall and muster our energy to work! The Chinese people must have the hard-bone spirit of the Chinese people.
    I thought: Our country is still "poor and blank." To change the face of "poor and blank," this heavy burden cannot all be placed on the shoulders of the leading comrades; we all must have pressure. With pressure, there is energy; with pressure, there are solutions. This pressure is consciously and voluntarily added by us; this pressure is the high sense of political responsibility of our petroleum workers to the Party, to the country, and to the people.

    Talking About Conditions
    Arriving at our destination, I visited and investigated everywhere. Seeing that the oilfield was so large, I shed tears of joy. The conditions at that time were indeed very difficult, and a few comrades sighed and complained. The instructor had been a soldier and fought against the American devils in Korea. I asked him, "What do you do when you encounter so many difficulties in battle? Do you fight or retreat?" The instructor said, "Absolutely cannot retreat. Even if there is only one person left, we cannot retreat; we must fight to the end until victory." He and I were of one mind. I had never fought in a war, but I thought we cannot retreat either. If there are conditions, we must go forward; if there are no conditions, we must create conditions to go forward. What is it to retreat!
    The drilling rig arrived at the train station. At that time, many drilling teams came all at once. How to get the drilling rig to the well site was a big problem. What to do if there were not enough cranes and tractors? To make revolution, you have to use your brain and think of solutions. I took out the Chairman Mao's works I had brought and organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Serve the People," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and everyone's confidence was strengthened. How do we listen to Chairman Mao's words? It is to quickly move the drilling rig to the well location to work and get the oil out first. We mobilized all the comrades to think of many clever ways. Everyone said: "People are alive, whether we carry it or move it, we have to get it up there. We cannot let the drilling rig stay at the station." We used ropes to pull, crowbars to pry, and wood blocks to pad, inch by inch, foot by foot, and moved the sixty-ton drilling rig to the well site. We pulled the diesel engine, gearbox, and drum, these large pieces of equipment, one by one onto the drilling platform. After fighting for three days and three nights, we finally erected the derrick on the construction site.
    Then the second difficulty came: without water, drilling could not be done, and everyone was as anxious as if they were on fire. I asked everyone what to do. Most comrades said: Without water, we'll carry it bucket by bucket, and we must start drilling. This was exactly what I meant. One comrade said that this was "fooling around" and asked, "Have you ever seen any country carrying water to drill wells?" I said, "That is our country!" I told the workers: "We even have to use our urine to drill wells!" Some people said that I was too vulgar, but I was using an analogy, regardless of whether it was vulgar or not. It was by relying on us carrying dozens of tons of water that we drilled the first well.
    After the first well was completed, when moving, there were still no cranes or tractors, and we relied on people to pull and carry with their shoulders. When I was directing the placement of the derrick, a drill pipe injured my leg. The instructor and the workers were very sad. I told them: "It doesn't matter, what is it to have a leg injured!" I asked the instructor to tear off a piece of my shirt and wrap it around my leg. At that time, it was a critical moment, and the oilfield area had not yet been taken down. I was afraid that the leading comrades would know that I had injured my leg and would ask me to go to the hospital, so I dared not tell the leading comrades and did not let the workers tell. The team's intern made me a pair of crutches, and I ran to the well site with crutches. As soon as the leading comrades arrived at the well site, I stuffed the crutches into the casing and stood up straight to report on the work to the leading comrades. It was really painful. In the end, the leading comrades still found out and sent me to the hospital.
    When drilling the third well, my leg was not healed, and I took a ride from the hospital and ran back. I asked someone to start the motorcycle I brought from Yumen and rode it to the well. Chairman Mao said: "No investigation, no right to speak." If you don't investigate, how can you have the right to speak in directing the drilling of the well! Once, when I was riding a motorcycle to the well, the motorcycle stalled on the road and pressed on my injured leg all at once. Just then, Zhou Zhengrong, our team's driller, passed by and helped me up. He asked me to take a ride back, but I refused, and limped towards the well, pushing the motorcycle. I don't know how, but tears streamed from Zhou Zhengrong's eyes. I said, "What are you crying for? You're such a big lad!" I thought to myself: The revolutionary predecessors shed blood and sacrificed themselves. What is it to be bumped and bruised?

    Dare to Take Risks
    The second well, when drilled to more than 700 meters, was about to blow out. At that time, there was no barite powder and no heavy mud. What to use to kill the well? Everyone came up with ideas, adding soil to the mud, but it all settled and was useless. There was really no other way, so we added seven or eight bags of cement prepared for cementing. We couldn't just watch the drilling rig fall into the earth! At that time, there was no mud gun and no mixer, and the mud could not be mixed evenly, and the well could not be suppressed. I didn't care about the injury on my leg and jumped into the mud pit to stir it. Some people said that adding cement to the mud was risky, and if it solidified in the wellbore, the well would be scrapped. They suggested asking the leading comrades to take a look first. I thought that the leading comrades could not bring heavy mud, and this was the idea of being afraid to take responsibility. I insisted on using cement to weight the mud, suppressed the well, and protected the drilling rig from being trapped in the earth. After working for dozens of hours, the blowout was finally controlled, and both the oil well and the drilling rig were preserved. If we had been afraid of this and afraid of that at that time, we would have been in trouble.
    At that time, we were drilling wells on the grassland with great enthusiasm, and it started to rain continuously. The rain kept falling, soaking us from head to toe, and the mosquitoes kept biting us. I told the workers: "Our Gansu is all dry land, and we have never seen rain. It's good here, the heavens are helping us take a bath!"

    What is Happiness
    In 1961, my injured leg had not fully recovered, and the leadership asked me to be the captain of the large team. I couldn't sit still even more, for fear of leading the team astray, and I ran to the well team all day long, running to seven or eight teams a day. At that time, life was very hard. I asked my family to fry some soybeans and cornmeal, put them in a cloth bag, carry them on my back, and eat some fried noodles and drink some water when I was hungry. These things have passed, and now life is better, but we must not forget hard work.
    Why did we do that? At that time, the leaders of the Ministry of Petroleum called on us to study "Two Essays," and our team also studied very enthusiastically. Everyone analyzed what was the main contradiction at that time? After debating for many days, the more we debated, the clearer we became. We had many difficulties, but no matter how big these difficulties were, they were not as big as the country's lack of oil. This contradiction, that contradiction, whether we can take down the large oilfield as soon as possible is the most important contradiction. We are working for ourselves, to add glory to the Party and to win honor for the people, to drill more wells, to produce more oil, and to quickly build our country into a strong country. What is it to suffer a little hardship and work a little harder! Hardship is glory, and hardship is happiness.

    Crude and Fine
    We can’t just recklessly rush forward in our work. Zhang Fei was even careful in his roughness. We should use our brains more, mobilize the masses, and honestly do a good job. When we first arrived in Daqing in 1960, we were not familiar with the underground situation, so we had to conduct investigation and research. When drilling the second well, I ran to many well teams in a row, asking them what formation was at what depth, what was the specific gravity of the mud, how to drill, and how the equipment was installed. In this way, we were more confident in drilling the well. In order to prevent the derrick from being overturned during the overall move, we asked everyone to discuss measures. Everyone discussed and came up with many solutions. Everyone proposed to remove the lower support and install the drilling platform from the upper beam to the lower beam, which was only half a meter high. We also analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of lowering it. The analysis showed that there were many advantages, but there was one disadvantage: the mud outlet was not easy to handle, and it was inconvenient to tighten the screws. We dug a ditch at the mud outlet, and people climbed in to tighten the screws. We used this method to drill four wells in a row.
    Drilling wells without using your brains and just relying on brute force will not work. At the beginning, it took one minute to raise each stand of pipe and three minutes to lower the traveling block, which made people sweat. At that time, we asked everyone to discuss how to make it faster. Finally, we came up with a solution to change the original eight-strand wire rope to six strands, which solved the problem.

    Responsible for a Lifetime
    The important thing in drilling wells is quality. To be responsible for the oilfield for a lifetime, we must be responsible for the quality for a lifetime. We have insisted on this since we drilled the first well in 1960. Especially when drilling straight wells, there are many tricks in this. First of all, we must understand the formation, know which layer is the interlayer and which layer is the transition layer, so that we can take different measures and different methods. To drill a straight well, we must first have a straight well in our minds, and we must have a high sense of political responsibility. Otherwise, we will not be able to drill it in a lifetime. At first, we had no way to drill straight wells. To ensure that the well inclination is only three degrees, or only one degree, where is the solution? It is in everyone's mind. Everyone studied and put forward many plans. After continuous experimentation, we finally drilled a straight well. We also gradually explored a set of methods for drilling straight wells with seven-inch drill collars, seven-and-a-half-inch drill bits, and four-and-a-half-inch drill pipes. Using this measure, we drilled a straight well with a maximum well inclination of only 0.5 degrees in the easily inclined area.
    After the well is drilled, the quality is ultimately determined by the oil production workers. We insist on organizing return visits to see if there are any problems. Especially for the second well we drilled in 1960 (the one where we added cement to the mud and suppressed the blowout), I go to see it every year and ask the oil production workers if there are any problems. I think we should be responsible for the wells we drill for a lifetime, not just hand over the well and get a certificate of qualification.
    After these years of battle, I have the following experience: As long as we combine the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win with a solid and down-to-earth scientific attitude, we can accomplish everything and do it well.

    Call On Brother Teams to Surpass Us
    However, no matter how fast a team drills and how good the quality is, it cannot take down an oilfield. We must call on all the drilling teams, dozens of drilling rigs, to drill, and surpass our team. In 1960, we brought some spare parts from the old mine. Seeing that the well team lacked square drill pipes, we sent them to them; if there was no diesel engine flywheel, we carried the flywheel and sent it to them; if there was no battery, we carried the battery and sent it to them; if there was no drill bit, we sent them a new drill bit. In the most tense time, the instructor led the workers to drill wells, and I personally led a team of people to help the brother team so that they could also drill.

    Remember Class Struggle
    In the old society, we poor people suffered all kinds of hardships. The Party liberated me and enabled the people of all ethnic groups to turn over. Why should we not repay the Party? Therefore, I have always had a repaying-kindness thought and wanted to work hard for the Party. At that time, I only knew that I should work hard myself, and I didn't know how to mobilize the masses. Even after I became a driller, I couldn't organize everyone. It was the same after I became the captain. I always worked hard by myself, thinking only of repaying the Party's kindness. After the Party's cultivation and education and studying Chairman Mao's works, I gradually realized that this repaying-kindness thought was not completely right, only half right. Now there are still many people in the world who are exploited and oppressed. Like my mother, who was beaten by the baojia chief until she had to drill into the cellar and was pulled out and beaten again, there are many such sufferers in the world, and they should also be liberated. We must make revolution and liberate all the oppressed people in the world who have not yet been liberated. What is it to sleep two hours later and sweat a few more times! We must support the oppressed nations and peoples.
    It has been more than ten years since liberation. After the democratic reform, the struggle against feudal landlords, and the anti-rightist struggle, I have engraved class struggle in my mind. This class struggle must not be let go at all, and we must never forget our roots. We must struggle for a lifetime and struggle to the end. We must keep struggling until the day we stop breathing. We must fight against the heavens, fight against the earth, and fight against erroneous ideas. In the oilfield these years, we have struggled through. Drilling wells is fighting against the heavens, fighting against the formation, and fighting against people's erroneous ideas. If we are a little careless or doze off a little in this class struggle, it won't work. I have been like this for the past five years. I believe in the Party, believe in the masses, and believe in myself. If erroneous ideas let me catch them, I will not let go and will fight. I will not say anything that is detrimental to the Party, I will not do anything that is detrimental to the Party, I will resolutely support the Party, and I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao. We must never forget class struggle. We must always remember the suffering of the old society, remember the sweetness of the new society, and always think of the two-thirds of the oppressed people in the world. Let us do revolution for a lifetime, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, and struggle for a lifetime.

    When Seeing Chairman Mao
    It has been more than ten years since liberation, and I have not achieved high standards in the things I should do, and I have not done many things well, but the Party has given me great honor. In 1959, I went to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Heroes and saw the great leader Chairman Mao and other leaders of the Party and the state. In 1964, I was again allowed to go to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. This time, I went because of the glory of all the workers in the entire battle zone. What do I have? The achievements are all made by everyone. On the way to Beijing, I thought that when I got to Beijing, on the day of the National Day celebration, I must get closer to Tiananmen Square and take a good look at Chairman Mao. Who would have thought that a few days after arriving in Beijing, I was notified to go to the Great Hall of the People the next morning. We guessed that Chairman Mao might want to receive us. That night, we tidied up our clothes, shaved our beards, and were so happy that we couldn't sleep all night. The next morning, when we arrived at the Great Hall of the People, there were many representatives of the People's Liberation Army, representatives of ethnic minorities, and representatives from the industrial and agricultural fronts inside. The comrades were all standing well. I happened to be standing behind two chairs in the front row. After a while, Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, and other leaders came and took pictures with us. I happened to be standing behind the chairs where Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu were sitting. At that time, I don't know why, but when I looked at Chairman Mao next to me, I couldn't stop the tears from flowing. In the old society, who treated poor kids like me as human beings? After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao saved us, we turned over, became masters of the country, and did some work that we should do, but the Party and the people gave us such high honor. Without the Party and Chairman Mao, where would Wang Jinxi be today? Whenever I think of the Party and Chairman Mao, I have inexhaustible energy all over my body.

            Willing to be an Old Ox
    I often think: Our country is still poor and has not been built well yet. We must work hard for a lifetime and carry out the revolution to the end, so that our country's oil can be calculated based on the population of 650 million, and each person will have more oil per year. With our Party, with Chairman Mao, with the Party Committee of the Ministry, and with all the workers, I think this is entirely possible. Chairman Mao taught us to be "oxen for the children." I herded cattle since I was a child and know the temper of the cattle. Cattle are very good, they contribute the most and enjoy the least. I am willing to be an old ox for the Party and the people for a lifetime, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, work hard for a lifetime, honestly implement the instructions of the leaders, be loyal to the revolution, and build the oilfield well.

### 为革命艰苦奋斗一辈子  王进喜同志在石油工业部的一次政治工作会议上的讲话

    为革命艰苦奋斗一辈子
    王进喜同志在石油工业部的一次政治工作会议上的讲话
    编者按：本报今天发表的大庆“铁人”王进喜同志的这篇讲话，值得所有同志一读。王进喜同志的这个讲话，是一篇渗透着无产阶级革命思想和革命感情的好教材。
    “铁人”，在大庆，早已不是个别人的英勇行为，而是多数人共同的革命特征。“铁人精神”，是我国工人阶级，在我们党的领导下，同天斗，同地斗，同阶级敌人斗，同错误思想斗的革命精神。人人争作“铁人”，人人学习“铁人精神”，这是大庆油田多快好省地建成社会主义革命化企业的主要原因之一。
    学大庆，对于每个企业的职工来说，就是学习大庆的“铁人”，作“铁人”式的革命战士。那个企业的“铁人”多了，占了压倒的优势，那个企业就会成为大庆式的单位。
    从王进喜同志的讲话中，我们还可以学习劳动人民的语言。这篇讲话用朴素生动的语言，表达了对党对毛主席对人民革命事业的热爱。没有常见的那种学生腔。每一句话都是斩钉断铁，怎么做就怎么说。这一点也很值得我们学习。
    硬骨头
    我原来在玉门油矿工作。一九六○年三月，我们带着拿下大油田，甩掉石油落后帽子，为祖国争气的雄心壮志来到大庆。
    我听到发现油田的消息，高兴极啦！多少年来我就想，什么时候我们国家能找到个大油田，那时我急得不行，一心想到油田参加会战。一想到我们国家石油工业落后，缺油，搞油的谁能坐得住，恨不得一口气把大油田拿下来，把石油落后帽子甩到太平洋里去！当时，玉门的领导同志对我们说，会战刚开始，困难一定很多。我们说：不怕！帝国主义骂我们，修正主义卡我们，我们就要挺起腰杆，鼓起干劲来干！中国人民，就要有中国人民的硬骨头劲才行。
    我想：咱们国家还是“一穷二白”。要改变“一穷二白”的面貌，这副重担子不能都压在领导同志身上，我们大家都要有压力。有压力就有干劲，有压力就有办法。这压力是我们自觉自愿加上的，这压力就是我们石油工人对党负责，对国家负责，对人民负责的高度政治责任心。
    谈条件
    来到目的地，我到处访问、到处调查，一看油田这么大，高兴得直流眼泪。那时的条件确实很困难，少数同志唉声叹气。指导员当过兵，在朝鲜打过美国鬼子。我就问他：“你打仗遇到这么多困难怎么办？是打还是退下来？”指导员说：“绝对不能退下来，剩下一个人也不能退，要顶着打，直到胜利为止。”他跟我一个心眼。我没打过仗，我想也不能退下来，有条件要上，没有条件创造条件也要上，退下来算个啥呀！
    钻机到了火车站。那时一下来了很多钻井队，怎么样把钻机弄到井场上是个大问题。吊车、拖拉机不够用怎么办？干革命就得动脑筋、想办法。我拿出带来的毛主席著作，组织大家学习《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，大家增强了信心。我们听毛主席的话怎么听呢？就是赶快把钻机搬到井位上去干，先把油拿出来。我们发动全体同志想了不少窍门。大家说：“人是活的，抬也好，搬也好，总是要上，不能让钻机在车站呆着。”我们硬是用绳子拉、撬杠撬、木块垫，一寸寸、一尺尺，把六十多吨重的钻机弄到井场。把柴油机、变速箱、滚筒这些大家伙，一件一件拉上钻台。奋战了三天三夜，终于把井架立在工地上。
    接着第二个困难又来了，没有水打不成钻，大家心急得象火烧一样。我问大家怎么办？多数同志说：没水，咱们一盆一盆地端，也得开钻。这正合我的意思。有个同志说这是“瞎胡闹”，还说：“你们见哪个国家端水打井？”我说：“就是我们国家！”我对工人讲：“咱们尿尿也要打井！”有人说我说话太粗了，我是打个比方，管它粗细。就是靠我们端了几十吨水，打出了第一口井。
    打完第一口井以后，搬家时，还是没有吊车、拖拉机，硬是靠人拉，肩扛。我在指挥放井架子的时候，一根钻杆把我的腿砸伤了。指导员和工人很难过。我跟他们说：“不要紧，砸了一下腿算什么！”我让指导员把我的衬衣撕下一块，把腿包上了。当时正是关键的时候，油田面积还没拿下来，我怕领导同志知道我砸了腿，让我去住医院，不敢和领导同志讲，也不让工人说。队里实习员给我做了一副拐杖，我拄着拐杖往井上跑。领导同志一到井场，我就把拐杖塞到套管里，硬挺着站起来向领导同志汇报工作，真痛的够呛。到后来还是让领导同志发现了，把我送进了医院。
    打第三口井时，腿没好，我从医院搭车跑回来啦。我把从玉门带来的摩托车，让别人发动好骑着上井。毛主席说：“没有调查就没有发言权。”你不调查怎么取得指挥打井的发言权呢！有一次，我骑着摩托车上井，路上摩托车熄火了，一下子压在我受伤的腿上。正好我们队的司钻周正荣路过，把我扶起来。他让我搭车回去，我不肯，便推着摩托车一拐一拐地往井上走。不知怎么搞的，周正荣眼里流出热泪，我说：“你哭啥呢，那么大个小伙子啦！”自己心想：革命前辈流血牺牲，自己碰一下，撞一下，算得了什么呢！
    敢担风险
    第二口井，打到七百多米，要喷。当时没重晶石粉，没有重泥浆，用什么压井呢？大家出主意，往泥浆里加土，结果都沉淀了，不顶用。实在没法，就把准备固井用的水泥，加了七八袋。总不能眼看着钻机掉进地球里去呀！那时没有泥浆枪，也没有搅拌器，泥浆搅不均匀，井压不住。我也顾不得腿上有伤，就跳到泥浆池里去搅攉。有人说，泥浆里加水泥是有风险的，凝固在井筒里井要报废，还是先请领导同志来看一看。我想领导同志又不能带重泥浆来，这是怕负责任的思想。我坚持用水泥加重泥浆，把井压住，保住钻机不陷到地球里。搞了几十个小时，到底把井喷治住了，油井、钻机都保住啦。当时要是前怕狼后怕虎，就倒霉啦。
    那个时候，我们在草滩上打井正在劲头上，下开连阴雨啦。雨下个不停，淋得浑身上下透湿，蚊子还一个劲的叮人。我跟工人说：“咱甘肃都是旱地，没见过雨水。这里好哇，还有老天爷帮咱洗澡呢！”
    什么是幸福
    一九六一年，砸伤的腿还没有全好，领导上让我当大队长，我更坐不住，怕把队伍带歪了，整天往井队跑，一天就跑七八个队。当时生活正艰苦，我让家里给炒点黄豆、玉米面装在个布袋里背着，走饿了就吃点炒面喝口水。这些事都过去了，现在生活好了，可不能忘了艰苦奋斗。
    我们为什么要那样干？当时石油部的首长号召我们大学“两论”，我们队也学得很起劲。大家分析当时什么是主要矛盾？辩论了好些日子，越辩心里越明白。我们有许许多多的困难，这些困难再大，也没有国家缺油困难大。这矛盾，那矛盾，能不能早日拿下大油田才是最主要的矛盾。我们是为自己干，是为党增光为民争气，是为了多打井、多出油，快快地把咱们国家建设强大，吃点苦，受点累算个啥！艰苦就是光荣，艰苦就是幸福。
    粗与细
    干工作不能光猛打猛冲。张飞还粗中有细呢。我们更应该多动脑筋，发动群众，老老实实地把工作干好。一九六○年我们刚到大庆，对地下情况不摸底，这就要搞调查研究嘛。在打第二口井时，我一连跑了好多井队，问他们多少米是什么层，泥浆的比重多大，怎么打法，设备是怎么安装的，就这样，我们打井更有把握了。为了防止整休搬家时井架被拉翻，就让大家讨论措施。大家一讨论办法就多了。大家提出，把下面支架取掉，打钻台从上大梁安到下大梁，只有半米高。我们又分析了降下来有几个好处，有几个坏处。分析结果，认为好处很多，就有一个坏处：泥浆出口不好搞，紧螺丝不方便。我们就在泥浆出口处挖个沟，紧螺丝时人爬进去。我们用这个办法连续打了四口井。
    打井不动脑筋，光拼傻力气是不行的。刚开始时，每起一个立杆需要一分钟，游动滑车放下来得三分钟，把人急得直出汗。当时就让大家讨论，怎么把它弄快些。最后终于想出了办法，把原来八股钢丝绳改成六股，解决了这个问题。
    负责一辈子
    打井重要的是质量。为油田负责一辈子，就要对质量负责一辈子。从一九六○年打第一口井开始，我们就是这样坚持的。特别是打直井，这家伙名堂多得很。首先要把地层搞清楚，知道那一层是夹层，那一层是交接层，好采取不同措施，不同的办法。我们打直井，首先要脑瓜子里有个直井，要有高度的政治责任心。要不，一辈子也打不成。起初，我们对打直井没办法。要保证井斜只有三度，只有一度，办法在什么地方呢？就在每个人的脑瓜子里。大家研究，提了好多方案，经过不断地试验，到底打成了直井。还逐步摸索出了一套用七吋钻铤、七吋半钻头，接四吋半钻杆打直井的办法。用这种措施，在易斜区打出了最大井斜只有零点五度的直井。
    井打成了，质量好坏，最后要由采油工人作鉴定。我们就坚持组织回访，看看有啥问题没有。特别是对一九六○年我们打的第二口井（就是往泥浆里加水泥，压住了井喷的那口井），我每年都去看一看，问问采油工有问题没有。我想，我们就要为自己打的井负责一辈子，不是交了井拿个合格证就算完。
    经过这几年的会战，我有这么一条体会：只要我们把敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，与扎扎实实的科学态度结合起来，就什么事都可以办得成，办得好。
    叫兄弟队超过我们
    可是，一个队再打得快，质量再好，也拿不下一个油田来。我们要叫所有的钻井队，几十部钻机都打上去，超过我们这个队。一九六○年我们从老矿带来一些配件，看到那个井队缺少方钻杆，我们就给他们送去；没有柴油机飞轮，就把飞轮抬着送去；没有电瓶，就把电瓶抬着送去；没有钻头，就把新钻头送去。在最紧张的时候，指导员领着工人打井，我就亲自领上一班人到兄弟队去帮忙，让他们队也打上去。
    牢记阶级斗争
    在旧社会，我们穷人受尽了苦。党把我解放了，使各族人民翻了身，我们为什么对党不报恩呢？因此，我一直有个报恩思想，要为党好好干。那时就知道自己好好干，不知道发动群众。就是当了司钻以后，也不会组织大家。以后当了队长也是这样，老是一个人闷头干，一心只想到要好好地报答党的恩情。经过党的培养教育，学习毛主席著作，我才逐步认识到这种报恩思想，不完全对，只对了一半。现在世界上还有好多受剥削受压迫的人。象我母亲过去让保甲长打得钻到窖里又被拉出来打的受苦人，世界上还多的是，还应当把他们解放出来嘛。我们就是要革命，就是要把全世界还没有得解放的被压迫人民解放出来。晚睡两个钟头，多出几身汗嘛，有什么了不起的。我们就是要支援被压迫的民族和人民。
    从解放到现在十几年了。经过民主改革，反封建把头斗争，反右派斗争，我这个脑瓜子里头，把阶级斗争记死了。这个阶级斗争啊，一点也不能放过去，永远也不能忘本，要斗争一辈子，斗争到底。斗争到那一天停止呼吸就算，非得要与天斗、与地斗、与错误思想斗不可。在油田上这几年，我们就是斗争过来的。打井就是跟天斗，跟地层斗，跟人的错误思想斗。对这个阶级斗争，要是脑瓜里稍微有点马虎、稍微打个盹就不行。这五年我就是这样，我就相信党、相信群众、相信自己，错误思想要让我逮住，就抓住不放，就要斗。对党不利的话不说，对党不利的事不做，坚决拥护党，坚决跟毛主席走。阶级斗争永远也不忘，坚决不能忘，要永远记住旧社会的苦，要记着新社会的甜，还要时刻想到全世界还有三分之二被压迫人民。干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，斗争一辈子。
    看见毛主席的时候
    解放十几年了，要做的事情没有做到高标准，好多事情还没有做好，党却给了我很大的荣誉。一九五九年到北京参加全国群英会，见到了伟大的领袖毛主席同党和国家的其他领导人。一九六四年，又让我到北京参加国庆观礼。这一次，我是托了全战区职工的光采去的，我有什么呀，成绩都是大家干出来的。去北京一路上，我就想，到了北京，国庆观礼那一天，一定要靠近天安门一些，好好看一下毛主席。哪想到到了北京不几天，就通知我第二天早晨到人民大会堂去，我们猜想，可能是毛主席要接见我们，当晚就整理衣服，刮了胡子，高兴得一夜都没睡好。第二天上午，到了人民大会堂，里面有不少解放军代表，少数民族代表和工业、农业战线上的代表，同志们都站得好好的。我正好站在前排两个椅子的后面。不一会，毛主席、刘主席等领导人都来了，和我们一起照相，我正好站在毛主席和刘主席坐的椅子后边。当时，不知道为什么，看看身边的毛主席，止不住眼泪直流。在旧社会，我这样的苦娃子，谁把我们当人看。解放了，党和毛主席救了我们，我们翻了身，当了国家的主人，做了点自己应该做的工作，党和人民却给了这么高的荣誉。没有党和毛主席，我王进喜那里会有今天。一想起党和毛主席，我这浑身就有使不完的劲。
            甘　当　老　黄　牛
    我常想：我们国家现在还穷，还没建设好，我们一定要艰苦奋斗一辈子，革命到底，要让我们国家的石油按六亿五千万人口来算，一年一个人有更多的石油。有我们党，有毛主席，有部党委，有全体职工，我看这完全是可能的。毛主席教导我们要当“孺子牛”，我从小放牛，知道牛的脾气，牛好得很，出力最大，享受最少，我就心甘情愿为党、为人民当一辈子老黄牛，读一辈子毛主席的书，艰苦奋斗一辈子，老老实实执行好领导的指示，忠心耿耿干革命，把油田建设好。（王进喜同志头象是邵宇同志画的，文中插题是本报编者加的）（附图片）
