    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 11th: The Cambodian News Agency reported on January 11th that Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk said at the inauguration ceremony of the Kamma-Reach railway station in Takeo Province on the 10th: "The Cambodian people would rather die than yield to the United States, which they regard as their number one enemy. In fact, it's not just us, because the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America also see the United States as their number one enemy."

    Prince Sihanouk said: "I want to explain to you how treacherous and malicious the American imperialist bloc, which is hostile to our system and neutrality, has become." He referred to the recent slanderous remarks about Cambodia in the American magazine "The Atlantic." This magazine said that since the People's Socialist Community took power, Cambodia has been on a downward spiral.

    Prince Sihanouk retorted, "Their malicious slander is obvious." He said that if Cambodia's situation were as they claimed, "where would the various construction achievements of the People's Socialist Community—and there will be more in the future—that I have personally presided over for ten years go? Is this railway, this solid station, the millions of cubic meters of earthwork completed by Cambodians working day and night, a daydream? Where did all these achievements go on the day the disreputable author of this deliberately slanderous article set foot on our land? In this case, is it any wonder that the Cambodian people hate the American imperialists to the core? That is why the Cambodian people would rather die than yield to the United States, which they regard as their number one enemy."

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 10th: According to a dispatch from the Cambodian News Agency on January 10th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk once again refuted Thailand's slander against Cambodia at a mass rally in Kampong Speu Province on the 9th. He said: "I repeat, our people will absolutely not invade them, but we will exercise the absolutely legitimate right to repel all their attacks."

    At the mass rally, Prince Sihanouk read a dispatch from Agence France-Presse on January 7th from the United Nations in New York. According to the dispatch, the Thai interim representative to the United Nations had written to (UN) Secretary-General U Thant, accusing the Cambodian armed forces of entering Thai territory deep into the Chamka Mou forest on December 15th of last year, reaching two kilometers, and firing on the Thai village of Hale from a small mountain inside Cambodian territory on January 2nd of this year.

    Prince Sihanouk said: "I asked Lon Nol to explain the situation, and Lon Nol told me that the Thais were the first to invade our country and launch an attack on us."

    "Our soldiers repelled the invaders, chasing them until they were about two kilometers inside their territory."

    Prince Sihanouk said: "We warned them that we would repay them in their own coin, and we have done so. They should understand that we mean what we say."

    Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: Bangkok news: Thai Air Force Commander-in-Chief Boonchu said on the 6th that Thai aircraft were ready for combat and would take military action against Cambodia as soon as they received orders.

    To cooperate with the needs of the United States to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Thai authorities have repeatedly sent troops to invade the Cambodian border areas and have constantly issued threats of war against Cambodia. Boonchu made this clamor at the opening ceremony of a new large military airport in Sakon Nakhon Province in northeastern Thailand.

### 西哈努克亲王说柬埔寨决不向美国屈服  警告泰国：柬埔寨将回击敌人一切进攻

    西哈努克亲王说柬埔寨决不向美国屈服
    警告泰国：柬埔寨将回击敌人一切进攻
    据新华社金边十一日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十一日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王十日在茶胶省卡马—雷恰铁路车站落成典礼上讲话说：“柬埔寨人民宁死也不向被他们看作是头号敌人的美国屈服。事实上不只是我们，因为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民也把美国看作是他们的头号敌人。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“我要向你们说明，敌视我国的制度和中立的美帝国主义集团的奸诈恶毒到了什么地步。”他谈到美国《大西洋》月刊最近诽谤柬埔寨的言论。这家月刊说什么，自从人民社会同盟执政以来，柬埔寨一直在走下坡路。
    西哈努克亲王驳斥说，“他们的恶毒中伤是显而易见的”。他说，如果柬埔寨的情况如同他们所说的那样，“十年来，我亲自主持落成仪式的人民社会同盟的各种建设成就——以后还有的是——到哪里去了呢？这条铁路、这个坚固的车站，柬埔寨人日以继夜地劳动完成的数百万立方米土方，难道是白日作梦吗？这篇蓄意诬蔑的文章的不象样的作者踏上我国国土的那一天，所有这些成就都到哪里去了？在这种情况下，柬埔寨人民恨透了美帝国主义者，这又有什么奇怪呢？这就是为什么柬埔寨人民宁死也不向被他们看作是头号敌人的美国屈服。”
    新华社金边十日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王九日在磅士卑省的一次群众大会上再一次驳斥了泰国对柬埔寨的诬蔑。他说：“我再说一遍，我们的人绝对不会侵略他们，但是我们将行使绝对正当的权利，对他们的一切进攻予以回击。”
    西哈努克亲王在群众大会上宣读了法新社一月七日从纽约联合国发出的一条消息。据这条消息说，泰国驻联合国临时代表曾写信给（联合国）秘书长吴丹，指责柬埔寨武装部队于去年十二月十五日进入泰国境内深达两公里的占乍穆森林，并且于今年一月二日从柬埔寨境内的一个小山上向泰国的哈勒村开火。
    西哈努克亲王说：“我要求朗诺说明情况，朗诺告诉我说，是泰国人首先侵入我国国境向我们发动进攻。
    “我国的士兵击退了侵略者，追逐他们，直到他们境内约两公里。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“我们正告过他们，我们将以其人之道还治其人之身，我们已经这样做了。他们应该明白，我们说了话是算数的。”
    据新华社八日讯　曼谷消息：泰国空军总司令汶趋六日说，泰国飞机已经作好战斗准备，一旦接到命令时就对柬埔寨采取军事行动。
    为了配合美国扩大侵越战争的需要，泰国当局一再派兵侵犯柬埔寨边境地区，并且不断对柬埔寨发出战争的威胁。汶趋是在泰国东北部沙功那空府一个新的大型军用机场的开幕仪式上发出这一叫嚣的。
