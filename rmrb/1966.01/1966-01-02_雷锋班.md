    Lei Feng Class
    In the New Year, we must learn from Lei Feng like Wang Jie, learn from Wang Jie like learning from Lei Feng, and further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Lei Feng Class Leader Yu Quanyang
    Our class spent a victorious 1965 with joy and welcomes the brilliant 1966 full of confidence. How did the soldiers march forward in the past year, following in the footsteps of Squad Leader Lei Feng?
    It has been more than three years since Comrade Lei Feng left us, but his glorious image is increasingly deeply imprinted in our hearts. In the most tense moments of work, we always think of Comrade Lei Feng's words and deeds during his lifetime; when encountering difficulties, we often recite "Lei Feng's Diary" word by word. The soldiers all say in their hearts that they must learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way like Lei Feng, and work hard on the word "use."
    When new soldiers step into the Lei Feng Class, they feel infinite glory; however, they do not truly understand the meaning of "glory." Therefore, veteran soldiers enthusiastically tell them about Lei Feng's heroic deeds and study Chairman Mao's works with the new soldiers to make them understand the full meaning of Lei Feng's words, "Living oneself is to make others live better." Our class also met with combat heroes Zhi Shunyi and Chen Daifu, learned from Mao Zedong Thought activists Liao Chujiang and Feng Fusheng, exchanged experiences with comrades from the Fourth Sharpshooter Company and the Dong Cunrui Class, and visited a certain army's Third Automobile Company six times to learn from these heroic models and advanced units, so that the soldiers further realized that learning from heroes is not for the sake of standing out and becoming heroes, but to serve the people like heroes. For a car driver, only by having a steering wheel in their heart for serving the people of China and the people of the world can they hold the steering wheel in their hand well and have true "glory."
    With this understanding, the soldiers work more consciously. Last year, our class was on duty in a certain place and heard that there were no barbers in the station, and the commune members had to delay half a day of production to get a haircut in the city. The soldiers thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Wherever our comrades go, they must maintain good relations with the masses, care for the masses, and help them solve their difficulties." Thinking of Lei Feng's revolutionary spirit of "revolution first, collective first, others first," we set up a "temporary barbershop" in the class and used our rest time to provide free haircuts for the local poor and lower-middle peasants. One day, an older sister led two children over mountains and ridges to get a haircut. We thought that other villagers in the mountains might also have difficulty getting haircuts, so we decided to send two comrades to nearby villages every Sunday to give haircuts to the villagers.
    All the soldiers in the class are vying to do more for others. In order to practice driving skills in complex terrain conditions during wartime, we set up dozens of obstacles on a mountain road less than three kilometers long. Comrade Du Xuehong, who had just arrived in our class, felt a little apprehensive when he entered the driver's seat and saw the rugged mountain road and deep valleys; after several attempts, he failed. All the comrades in the class were as concerned as if they had encountered difficulties themselves, enthusiastically helping Du Xuehong study Chairman Mao's works, find the reasons for the failure, and some comrades even held his hand to help him correct his movements. When he got into the car, everyone scrambled to crank the engine; when he got out of the car, they competed to add oil, add water, and wipe and maintain it. From then on, whenever Du Xuehong got into the car, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, Lei Feng's scars on his hands, and his own bitter childhood, and thought of the two-thirds of the oppressed people in the world, and felt full of incomparable power, overcoming one difficulty after another, and finally mastered relatively complex battlefield driving skills.
    Over the past year, our class has won the honorary title of "Four Good Company" for the fifth time, and all members of the class have been rated as "Five Good Soldiers." This glory is the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and is the result of being inspired by the revolutionary spirit of Lei Feng and Wang Jie. In the New Year, we must learn from Lei Feng like Wang Jie, learn from Wang Jie like learning from Lei Feng, and further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work.

    雷锋班
    在新的一年里，要象王杰那样去学雷锋，象学雷锋那样去学王杰，更进一步活学活用毛主席著作。雷锋班班长　于泉洋
    我们班满怀喜悦度过了胜利的一九六五年，充满着信心迎接那灿烂辉煌的一九六六年。在过去的一年里，战士们是怎样踏着雷锋班长的脚印向前迈进的呢？
    雷锋同志离开我们已有三年多了，可是，他的光辉形象却越来越深地印在我们的心上。在工作最紧张的时刻，我们总会想到雷锋同志生前的一言一行；在遇到困难的时候，我们常常一字一句地诵读着《雷锋日记》。战士们的心里都说，一定要象雷锋那样活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    新战士们一跨进雷锋班，都感到无限光荣；但是，他们并没有真正懂得“光荣”的含义。于是，老战士就热情地给他们讲雷锋的英雄事迹，同新战士一起学习毛主席著作，使他们懂得，雷锋说的“自己活着，就是为使别人过得更美好”的全部意义。我们班还会见了战斗英雄郅顺义、陈代富，学习毛主席著作积极分子廖初江、丰福生等，同神枪手四连、董存瑞班的同志们谈心得，还六次访问了某部汽车三连，向这些英雄模范和先进单位学习，使战士们进一步认识到，学英雄不是为了出人头地当英雄，而是为了象英雄那样去为人民服务。对于一个汽车驾驶员来说，只有心中有了为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的方向盘，才能把好手中的方向盘，才有真正的“光荣”。
    有了这样的认识，战士们做工作就更自觉了。去年，我们班在某地执勤，听说驻地没有理发员，社员进城理一次发得耽误半天生产。战士们想到毛主席的教导：“我们的同志不论到什么地方，都要和群众的关系搞好，要关心群众，帮助他们解决困难。”想到雷锋的“革命第一、集体第一、他人第一”的革命精神，我们便在班里设立了“临时理发馆”，利用休息时间为当地贫下中农免费理发。有一天，一位大嫂领了两个孩子翻山越岭赶来理发，我们又想到其他山村的社员理发可能也有困难，便决定每逢星期日派两位同志到附近各村为社员理发。
    全班战士人人争着为别人多做些事。为了苦练战时复杂地形条件下的驾驶技术，我们在一段不到三公里的山地上，设置了几十种障碍物。刚到我们班不久的杜学洪同志，一进驾驶台，看到那崎岖不平的山路和深谷，心里就有点发怵；经过几次练习都失败了。全班同志就象自己遇到困难一样，热心地帮助杜学洪学习毛主席著作，找失败的原因，有的同志还把着手帮他纠正动作。他上车，大家抢着给摇车；他下车，又争着给加油、加水、擦拭保养。从此，杜学洪一上汽车就想起毛主席的教导，想起雷锋手上的伤疤和自己苦难的童年，想起世界上三分之二被压迫的人民，便感到浑身充满了无比的力量，克服了一个个困难，终于掌握了比较复杂的战地驾驶技术。
    一年来，我们班第五次荣获了四好班的光荣称号，全班人人被评为五好战士。这个光荣是活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是受雷锋、王杰革命精神鼓舞的结果。在新的一年里，我们要象王杰那样去学雷锋，象学雷锋那样去学王杰，更进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导我们的各项工作。
