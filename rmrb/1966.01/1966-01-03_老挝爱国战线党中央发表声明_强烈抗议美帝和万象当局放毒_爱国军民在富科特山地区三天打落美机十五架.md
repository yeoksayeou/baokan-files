    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 31st dispatch: According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee issued a statement on the 29th, strongly protesting the barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Vientiane authorities in spreading chemical poisons in the liberated areas and killing the Lao people.

    At the end of November, U.S. imperialism and the Vientiane authorities dispatched aircraft to the areas of She Xiao, She Ka Suo, and Mang Xian in Luang Prabang Province to spread chemical poisons, causing many residents in these areas to be poisoned.

    The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front calls on world public opinion to condemn the above-mentioned crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and demands that they immediately stop using chemical poisons and stop the war of slaughtering the Lao people.

    The statement concluded, "We warn U.S. imperialism and the Vientiane puppet regime: the more actions they take to harm the Lao people, the more resistance they will encounter from the Lao people and the more disastrous defeats they will suffer."

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd dispatch: "Voice of Laos" radio broadcast a comprehensive report on the 1st, stating that the patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Phou Kout Mountain area of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, shot down a total of fifteen U.S. bandit aircraft and damaged sixteen others in three days from December 27th, 28th, and 29th, 1965.

    The radio said that during these three days, U.S. imperialism dispatched more than eighty aircraft sorties to fiercely bomb and strafe the Phou Kout Mountain area. The local patriotic soldiers and civilians severely punished the U.S. aerial bandits with accurate and fierce artillery fire, achieving great victories. (Attached picture)

    声明说，老挝爱国战线党呼吁世界舆论谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的上述罪行，要求它们立即停止使用化学毒药，停止屠杀老挝人民的战争。
    声明最后说，“我们警告美帝国主义和万象伪政权：危害老挝人民的行动愈多，就愈加受到老挝人民的反抗而遭到更惨重的失败。”
    新华社康开二日电　“老挝之声”电台一日广播的综合报道说：老挝川圹省富科特山地区爱国军民在一九六五年十二月二十七日、二十八日和二十九日三天中，共打落十五架美国强盗飞机，打伤十六架。
    电台说，在这三天中，美帝国主义出动了八十多架次飞机，猛烈轰炸和扫射富科特山地区。当地爱国军民以准确和猛烈的炮火严惩美国空中强盗，取得了很大胜利。（附图片）
