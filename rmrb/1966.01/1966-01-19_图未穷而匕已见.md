    While the Johnson administration’s so-called “peace offensive” is in full swing, U.S. imperialism's activities to prepare for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam are intensifying daily.
    On the 17th, U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara announced that the U.S. would increase its armed
        forces by another 113,000 personnel and decided to ask Congress for an additional $12.3 billion in war expenses for the invasion of Vietnam. Almost simultaneously, another 8,500 U.S. invading troops arrived in South Vietnam. The meaning of these things needs no explanation.
    Johnson has repeatedly sworn to the heavens that he sincerely wants to end the war of aggression against Vietnam and "achieve peace" in Vietnam. Is the U.S. government stepping up the expansion of its army, adding war funds, and continuing to increase its troops an action to "seek peace" or to expand the war?
    When the Johnson administration put forward its so-called "Fourteen Points Plan," it pretended to say something like "We have put everything into the basket of peace." In fact, what the U.S. ruling authorities are doing is throwing everything needed to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam into the "basket of war."
    World opinion has long exposed Johnson's "peace talks" fraud, pointing out that it is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the conspiracy to expand the war. Since it is a "smokescreen," it will not last long, and after completing its mission of concealment, it will no longer be needed by its releaser. There is a saying in ancient Chinese books called "The Map is Unrolled and the Dagger is Revealed". However, now U.S. imperialism is revealing the dagger before the map is fully unrolled.

### 图未穷而匕已见

    图未穷而匕已见
    当约翰逊政府的所谓“和平攻势”搞得热火朝天的时候，美帝国主义准备扩大侵越战争的活动正在日益加紧。
    十七日，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉宣布，美国将把武装
        部队再扩充十一万三千人，并且决定要求国会追加侵越战费一百二十三亿多美元。几乎与此同时，又有八千五百名美国侵略军队开到了南越。这些事情意味着什么是用不着解释的。
    约翰逊一再指天发誓，他真心诚意要结束侵越战争，在越南“实现和平”。美国政府加紧扩充军队、追加战费、继续增兵，难道是“谋求和平”，而不是扩大战争的行动？
    约翰逊政府在提出所谓“十四点计划”的时候，装模作样地说什么“我们已经把所有的东西放进了和平的篮子”。事实上，美国统治当局正在干的，是要把扩大侵越战争所需要的一切东西投进“战争的篮子”里去。
    各国舆论早已揭穿约翰逊的“和谈”骗局，指出它不过是为了掩盖扩大战争阴谋的烟幕。既然是“烟幕”，它就持久不了，在完成了它的掩蔽使命之后，也就不再为它的施放者所需要。中国古书有所谓“图穷匕见”的典故。然而，现在美帝国主义却是图未穷而匕首已见了。
