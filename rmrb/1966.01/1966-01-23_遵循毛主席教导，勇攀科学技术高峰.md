    Following Chairman Mao's Teachings, Scale the Peak of Science and Technology
    Tang Yingbin, Worker-Engineer of Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai
    Reading the New Year's Day editorial in the *People's Daily*, I was deeply moved. The more I read, the more invigorated I became; every word and sentence resonated with me. Our national economy has never been better than it is now, and our material and technological foundation has never been as strong.
    Without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China! I have been wielding a welding torch for thirty-one years. In old China, welding technology was practically nonexistent; everything depended on "foreigners." The decade-plus after liberation has been a decade of earth-shaking change! Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we dare to revolutionize, dare to scale peaks, and dare to do things that no one has done before. We used electroslag welding to manufacture China's first 12,000-ton hydraulic press. This new technological achievement has attracted great attention internationally.
    In July 1965, the Party and the government sent me to join the Chinese delegation to attend the 18th Annual Assembly of the International Institute of Welding in Paris, France. As soon as we got off the plane, we were warmly welcomed. This made me think of the experience of my mentor's elder brother, Liu Moquan, China's first-generation welding worker. Fifty years ago, he suffered oppression and exploitation in China, to the point of unemployment and desperation, and had to wander to France as a laborer. He endured hardship and humiliation in France. Today, I, a second-generation Chinese welding worker, represent a powerful motherland to attend an international academic conference in France. An ordinary Chinese worker sits with hundreds of experts and professors from twenty-six countries, representing the country to present a paper. The contrast is truly moving. How happy and proud the Chinese people living in the era of Mao Zedong are!
    China submitted three papers to the welding annual assembly, one of which was *The Application of Electroslag Welding in the Manufacture of the 12,000-Ton Hydraulic Press*. Before the discussion, I was a bit nervous because it was my first time participating in an international activity, and I didn't speak the language. I worried about whether I could answer the questions during the discussion satisfactorily, and whether the paper would pass smoothly. All of these things were related to the honor of the motherland. My comrades encouraged me, saying, "Go ahead boldly! You must show the backbone and spirit of the Chinese working class!"
    Our paper on electroslag welding was discussed in the twelfth group. Our group discussed a total of three papers on electroslag welding. The order of discussion was Britain, Japan, and China. When the British paper was discussed, five or six people raised their hands to ask questions, and it took the author about fifteen minutes to answer before it passed. Then, when the Japanese paper was discussed, even more people raised their hands to ask questions. Later, the executive chairman announced that this paper could not be passed this year and asked the author to supplement it and come back to participate in the discussion next year.
    Next, it was our turn. Before the questioning, the executive chairman said to everyone, "China's electroslag welding has been successfully applied in the huge hydraulic press. This paper has already been distributed to everyone. Personally, I think this paper is clear in its discussion, complete in its content, and rich in data and pictures. Now, please ask your questions!"
    Minute after minute passed, and no one asked a question. The executive chairman urged repeatedly, but still no one raised their hand. Finally, the chairman announced its passage. At this moment, a burst of warm applause erupted in the venue, expressing congratulations. The executive chairman also told everyone that our paper would be published in the society's annual journal. At this moment, my eyes were unconsciously filled with tears because our great motherland had once again won honor internationally, and people had once again seen the creative talents of the Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought! China's other two papers also passed smoothly.
    Many international friends are concerned about every achievement of our country, which makes our responsibility even heavier. In recent years, although we have done some work, it is still too little compared to the contribution we should make to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Chairman Mao taught us: "Because China is a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 600 million people, China should make a greater contribution to humanity."
    Shanghai is an old industrial base, and our Jiangnan Shipyard is an old factory with more than a hundred years of history. In the struggle to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels, we must give play to the role of the old base and the old factory. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, we will continue to adopt many new welding technologies and experiment with new cutting-edge projects. On the road ahead, we will inevitably encounter this or that difficulty, but we have Mao Zedong Thought and the experience of manufacturing the 10,000-ton hydraulic press, so we have no obstacles that we cannot overcome. We must keep Chairman Mao's teachings firmly in mind, work hard during the Third Five-Year Plan period, and make contributions to supporting the struggle of oppressed class brothers all over the world!

### 遵循毛主席教导，勇攀科学技术高峰

    遵循毛主席教导，勇攀科学技术高峰
    上海江南造船厂工人工程师  唐应斌
    新年，读了《人民日报》元旦献辞，我的心情很激动，越读精神越振奋，每字每句都讲到了我的心里。我国国民经济从来没有象现在这样好过，我国的物质技术基础从来没有象现在这样雄厚。
    没有共产党，没有毛主席，就没有新中国！我捏了三十一年电焊龙头了。旧中国电焊技术实际上是空白，什么都依赖“洋人”。解放后的十多年，真是天翻地覆的十多年！我们遵循毛主席教导，敢于革命，敢于攀高峰，敢于做前人没有做过的事。我们用电渣焊制成了我国第一台一万二千吨水压机。这一新的技术成果，在国际上引起了很大重视。
    一九六五年七月，党和政府派我参加中国代表团，出席在法国巴黎举行的国际焊接学会第十八届年会。我们一走下飞机，就受到人们热烈欢迎。这使我不禁想起了我的师伯——中国第一代焊接工人刘墨泉的遭遇。五十年前，他在国内受尽了压迫和剥削，以至失业，走投无路，只好飘泊到法国当劳工。他在法国历尽辛酸，饱受屈辱。今天，我这个中国第二代的焊接工人，代表强大的祖国来到法国参加国际性的学术会议。一个普通的中国工人，和来自二十六个国家的几百名专家、教授坐在一起，代表国家发表论文，对比之下，真使人感慨万千。生活在毛泽东时代的中国人民，是多么幸福，多么值得骄傲！
    我国参加焊接年会的论文共三篇，其中一篇就是《电渣焊接在一万二千吨水压机制造中的应用》。在讨论之前，我有点紧张，因为我第一次参加国际性活动，语言又不通，对讨论中的提问是否能圆满地回答，论文能否顺利地通过，这些都关系到祖国的荣誉。同志们都鼓励我说：“放大胆去闯吧！要把中国工人阶级的硬骨头志气拿出来！”
    我国关于电渣焊接的论文是在第十二组讨论的。我们这个组讨论电渣焊接的论文共有三篇。讨论的次序是英国、日本、中国。讨论英国的那一篇论文时，台下举手提问的有五六个人，由作者解答了一刻钟左右才通过。接下去讨论日本那篇时，举手提问的人更多。后来，执行主席宣布：这篇论文今年还不能通过，请作者补充以后，到明年再来参加讨论。
    接下去，就轮到我国的那篇了。在提问之前，执行主席对大家说：“中国的电渣焊接在庞大的水压机上应用较成功，这篇论文早已发给各位。我个人认为，这篇论文论述清楚，内容完整，数据、图片都极丰富。现在就请各位提问吧！”
    时间一分钟一分钟地过去，一直没有人提问。执行主席再三催促，还是没有人举手。最后，主席宣布通过。这时，会场上爆发出一阵热烈的掌声，表示祝贺。执行主席还告诉大家，我国的这篇论文将在学会的年刊上发表。此时此刻，我的眼睛不知不觉地被泪花蒙住，因为我们伟大的祖国在国际上又一次赢得了荣誉，人们又一次看到用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人的创造才能！我国的另外两篇论文也都顺利地通过了。
    国际上许多朋友关心着我国的每一个成就，这就更加重了我们的责任。几年来，我们虽然做了一些工作，但是，同对中国革命和世界革命应该作的贡献比较起来，还是太少了。毛主席教导我们：“因为中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献”。
    我们上海是一个老工业基地，我们江南造船厂是一个有百多年历史的老厂，在赶超世界先进水平的斗争中，一定要发挥老基地、老工厂的作用。在第三个五年计划期间，我们将继续采用许多新的焊接技术，试验研究新的尖端项目。在前进的道路上，一定会碰到这样或那样的困难，但是，我们有毛泽东思想，有制造万吨水压机的经验，我们就没有克服不了的障碍。我们一定牢记着毛主席的教导，在第三个五年计划期间奋发工作，为支援全世界被压迫的阶级兄弟的斗争作出贡献！
