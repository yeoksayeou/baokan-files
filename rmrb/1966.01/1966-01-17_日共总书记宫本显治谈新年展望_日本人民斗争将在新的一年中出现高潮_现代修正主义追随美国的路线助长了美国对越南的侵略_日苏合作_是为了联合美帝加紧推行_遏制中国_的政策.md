    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 16th: Japanese Communist Party Central Committee General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto issued a statement on the eve of the New Year, condemning the United States for playing "peace talks" conspiracies in the Vietnam issue while preparing to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. He also exposed the Sato government and modern revisionists for engaging in "Japan-Soviet cooperation."
    The *Akahata* newspaper published the full text of Miyamoto's speech on January 1st. This speech was in response to questions raised by an *Akahata* reporter.
    In response to a question about the characteristics of the domestic and international situation, Miyamoto said: "American imperialism is brutally expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and recently even openly threatened to invade Cambodia. In response, the struggle of the heroic and unyielding Vietnamese people and the international struggle against imperialism and for peace, although there are complex situations, have achieved development. Moreover, recently, the opportunist line of following the United States, pursued by those headed by Khrushchev and then by Khrushchev's successors, has greatly gone bankrupt, and revisionists have had to adopt two-faced policies, because it has become difficult to openly beautify imperialism as in the past."
    Miyamoto pointed out that the Sato cabinet, during this period, supported American aggression against Vietnam and forcibly approved the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," and has embarked on a path of fierce political reaction. The Japanese people and democratic forces have waged the largest-scale struggle since the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to oppose these policies. He pointed out that although the huge undercurrent of anger of the people and democratic forces may encounter various twists and turns, this year's struggle still has the conditions and trend to continue to develop in an all-round way. The domestic and international situation will still be a tense situation.
    He said that under these circumstances, we must adhere to the "Four Banners" (Editor's note: The "Four Banners" were proposed by the Japanese Communist Party at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee on July 13, 1962. They are: 1. The banner of the people's democratic revolution against imperialism and monopoly capital; 2. The banner of the national democratic united front; 3. The banner of building a strong Japanese Communist Party; 4. The banner of the national liberation and peaceful international united front against imperialism headed by the United States.), and continue to leap forward in the new year.
    Speaking about the situation in Vietnam, Miyamoto said: "American aggression against Vietnam is an unjust war of aggression and must be punished accordingly. American imperialism has been bogged down in a quagmire due to the stubborn and unyielding resistance of the Vietnamese people. In order to get rid of this predicament, it is preparing to expand the war to the entire Indochina, launch new aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while playing various tricks such as 'unconditional negotiations' and 'ceasefire in the current situation.'" He said, "We firmly believe that no matter what, the Vietnamese people will achieve final victory, and American imperialism and its followers will suffer final defeat."
    He said: "The fact that the Vietnamese people have risen up to strike at the American aggressors, and the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, must be highly valued."
    Miyamoto also pointed out: "The current situation is that the American aggressors are not only openly expanding the aggression against South Vietnam, but also are aggressing day after day against the territory of socialist countries standing at the Asian outpost of the world socialist system, repeatedly carrying out such cruel and barbaric bombing, and are preparing to expand new aggression."
    Miyamoto said: "American aggression against Vietnam stems from the aggressive nature of American imperialism, but it is also clear that they have their own calculations in taking criminal actions."
      "Regarding this, first of all, because the international modern revisionist trend since Khrushchev came to power has been implementing a line of following American imperialism, American imperialism has become increasingly convinced that it can underestimate the socialist camp, and can expect that a certain part of it will become opportunistic, and can defeat the socialist countries one by one. Moreover, the opportunist line of Khrushchev and others has for a long time very seriously weakened the system for people of various countries to effectively wage struggle against American imperialism. Furthermore, on March 1st of last year, the Soviet Communist Party leadership forcibly convened a meeting unilaterally convened by it, creating a situation that made it more difficult to unite the international communist movement. This has also fueled the ambition of the American aggressors to attempt to defeat them one by one. These are the foundations for the formation of the above situation.
    "From the above points, it is clear that in order to immediately give American imperialism an effective blow commensurate with the original international balance of power between aggression, war forces and anti-imperialist, peace forces, it is important to overcome all opportunistic, great-power chauvinistic and secessionist trends and achieve true unity of the international communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. Also, it is important that, in the case that the above goals cannot be fully realized, international united action to struggle against American imperialist aggression against Vietnam should also be organized in fact, resolutely striking as early as possible at American imperialism's attempt to continue to adopt and expand cruel and barbaric robbery by taking advantage of the disunity of the socialist camp and the international democratic and peaceful forces. This is not only an international priority from the point of view of strengthening the struggle against American imperialism first of all, but also important from the point of view of overcoming the opportunistic trend within the international communist movement and the international peace and democratic movement through practice."
      Miyamoto said, "We believe that in order to defeat the American aggressors' illegal and extremely insidious and vicious aggression as early as possible, and in order to minimize the sacrifices of the Vietnamese people and achieve victory, we must use every means to strengthen the front of the international anti-imperialist and peace movement.
      "Our Japanese Communist Party also believes that it is necessary to further strengthen the system of joint struggle between the Marxist-Leninist parties in Asia neighboring Vietnam to oppose American imperialist aggression against Vietnam and Asia, and to support the Vietnamese people and the Asian people who are fighting against American imperialism."
      Miyamoto said: "American imperialism is conducting shameless deceptive propaganda, saying that the aggression the United States is carrying out in Vietnam 'is a just action taken to stop China from invading Vietnam.' American Vice President Humphrey and others, when meeting with *Asahi Shimbun* reporter Qin (Zhengliu) in November last year, tried their best to emphasize this. It is necessary to repeatedly expose to the Japanese people that the essence of this deceptive argument, their 'unconditional negotiations' posture, is to demand that they be allowed to freely fix the aggression against South Vietnam in fact, and to divide South Vietnam from North Vietnam, turning it into an American dependency and colony.
      "At the same time, it is necessary to further strengthen the activities of our country's support Vietnam committee, and it is necessary to more strongly appeal to the Japanese people to provide the Vietnamese people with spiritual and material support as much as possible.
      "The Vietnamese people have repeatedly stated that they will fight for ten or twenty years, if necessary, until they drive the Americans out. We, the Japanese people, must also unite with the world's anti-imperialist and peace forces this year to fight to drive American imperialism out of Vietnam and the entire Asian region as early as possible."
    Miyamoto also spoke about the characteristics of the situation after the struggle against the "Japan-South Korea Treaty." He pointed out that due to the struggle of the democratic forces, the Sato government has become increasingly unstable after using violent actions to forcibly pass the "Japan-South Korea Treaty." It is attempting to turn the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" into a fait accompli and further concretize the goals of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" in order to overcome this unstable situation.
    He said that on this point, "it is important that we consistently adhere to the attitude of not recognizing the 'Japan-South Korea Treaty,' and continuously organize struggles against the specific measures they take based on the 'Japan-South Korea Treaty,' and fight for the unity and friendship of the peoples of Japan and North Korea."
    Miyamoto pointed out: "The Sato cabinet once said at the beginning of its establishment that (solving) the 'Japan-South Korea' issue and the Japan-China issue were their own diplomatic tasks, but recently, after the signing of the 'Japan-South Korea Treaty,' they have put the Japan-China issue aside and are striving to promote 'advancing diplomacy towards the Soviet Union.'"
    "Our party has consistently believed that establishing friendship in the correct sense between the peoples of Japan and the Soviet Union and concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty are part of strengthening the friendship between the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia and the world, and realizing the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and all socialist countries. However, what is the intention of the Liberal Democratic Party Sato cabinet, which was originally a conservative and reactionary anti-communist standard-bearer, to suddenly say today that it wants to 'promote diplomacy towards the Soviet Union'?"
    "One of the purposes of saying that it wants to 'promote diplomacy towards the Soviet Union' is, of course, that Japanese monopoly capital wants to find new overseas markets in the Soviet Union in the context of economic recession. At the same time, as people say, (the Japanese government) wants to politically implement diplomacy on a 'stable political line,' so promoting Japan-Soviet diplomacy as a form of 'US-Soviet cooperation,' includes the intentions of the US and Japanese ruling classes. This is a new characteristic.
      "Modern revisionists, represented by Khrushchev, have followed American imperialism in the form of 'US-Soviet cooperation,' but today, in the face of the blatant US aggression policies such as the war of aggression against Vietnam, it has become difficult to follow American imperialism and cooperate with it in the past form.
    "Therefore, the ruling classes of the United States and Japan are attempting to salvage the 'US-Soviet cooperation' line, which is in turmoil today, by strengthening friendly relations between Japan, a loyal ally subordinate to the United States, and the Soviet Union. In this sense, they attach particular importance to 'Japan-Soviet cooperation.'"
    Miyamoto said: "Recently, after hearing Moscow Radio's broadcast commemorating the ninth anniversary of Japan's accession to the United Nations, I was surprised that Moscow Radio was trying its best to emphasize 'Japan-Soviet joint action.' The so-called 'joint action' in international politics, of course, not only means concluding agreements on simple business aspects such as trade and transportation, but also means pursuing common goals on the international political line."
    Miyamoto asked: "What common goals are Japan and the Soviet Union going to take joint action in international politics according to?"
    He pointed out: "It is clear that the keynote of Japan's foreign policy is to follow the United States, and to acknowledge that American aggression against Vietnam is correct, and to give active support; secondly, it is to be hostile to China and hostile to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The so-called truly correct policy of peaceful coexistence is to fight against this non-peaceful policy to prevent wars of aggression. And this view that there is a basic common line with the foreign policy of the Japanese government, which is characterized by blatantly following the United States or adopting policies hostile to various socialist countries in Asia, is, in the final analysis, to change a form and implement the policy of following American imperialism and compromising with American imperialism towards the Japanese reactionary ruling class."
    Miyamoto said: "On the 'Japan-South Korea' issue and many other issues, Soviet news agencies have also published arguments criticizing the Japanese government, but, judging from the overall situation of Moscow Radio and other things in the past six months, it has been constantly unprincipled in following and beautifying the Liberal Democratic Party government's basic line of following the United States, reviving militarism and imperialism, saying that 'we cannot but express our approval of the systematic work that Japan has been doing in these years to restore its trust and prestige in Asian countries.' Taking this approach not only makes the Japanese ruling class complacent, but also spreads wrong views among the Japanese people.
      "Moreover, modern revisionists since Khrushchev have been carrying out various conspiracies to isolate the Japanese Communist Party and split the Japanese democratic forces.
      "Under such circumstances, the Japanese ruling class, which was originally anti-communist, considered various conditions and began to 'promote diplomacy towards the Soviet Union,' and took this approach in the form of a 'stable political line' that was strongly supported by American imperialists.
      "The Sato cabinet inherited the traditions of successive reactionary cabinets and still has not restored diplomatic relations with China—Japan, which in the past launched the most intolerable long-term war of aggression against it and carried out sabotage activities—and is cooperating with American imperialism's 'containment of China' policy, supporting its aggression against Vietnam. In such a situation, it is 'promoting diplomacy towards the Soviet Union' on the one hand, putting on a 'forward-looking posture' in a grand manner, while on the other hand, it is trying to eliminate the various anti-democratic impressions left by the 'Japan-South Korea Treaty' and seek to maintain the reactionary regime in a stable manner for a long time."
      "We are in favor of implementing peaceful coexistence in the correct sense between countries with different social systems, and (Japan should) restore diplomatic relations with all countries. Our party's program also clearly states this. However, I believe that now that American imperialism is pursuing such an aggressive policy, and the Japanese government is blatantly following American imperialism's aggressive policy, what we expect from the socialist camp in this situation is: do not take an unprincipled policy of following the United States and its allies, but should take a diplomatic line that correctly raises the vigilance of the Japanese people and the people of the world against their aggression and reactionary policies. We must correctly see through that one of the important motivations of the Liberal Democratic Party Sato cabinet to 'promote diplomacy towards the Soviet Union' is to treat this approach as a tactic of 'containing China' today. We should further strengthen the movement for friendship between the peoples of Japan and the Soviet Union in the correct sense and promote the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, as well as the movement to demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations."
    He said that monopoly capital and the (Japanese) government are placing the way out of the economic recession in intensifying the exploitation and plunder of the people, strengthening labor intensity, and laying off workers. Under such circumstances, the working class is already in a state where it must unite with the political struggles and struggles to safeguard life of the broad masses of people of all strata, and fight to defend its own life and rights. In the future, the joint struggle of democratic forces that combine political struggle with economic struggle and the struggle to overthrow the Sato cabinet and force the dissolution of the Diet will become more and more urgent and have more important significance.
    Miyamoto then talked about the united struggle of the Japanese democratic forces and the role and tasks of the Japanese Communist Party, saying: "In the new year, the unity of the democratic forces, the united struggle of the opposition parties such as the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Komeito Party, will all reach a climax. In order to welcome the arrival of such a climax, we must resolutely continue to wage resolute struggles against all forms of obstruction from right-wing splinter forces and anti-party revisionists in ideological and practical actions. In order to develop the united struggle needed by the Japanese people, the Japanese Communist Party is willing to earnestly do its best." He said, "Our party, as a party that adheres to Marxism-Leninism, has consistently adhered to the uncompromised struggle against the main danger of modern revisionism in theory and politics, while also preventing the generation of dogmatism. This year, we will further faithfully abide by this principle, and will also contribute to strengthening the international anti-imperialist united front against American imperialism."
    Miyamoto finally said: "Now, judging from the situation in the world and Asia, our Japanese Communist Party bears a very important historical mission, whether in terms of mass struggle or in terms of party building. In the new year, the entire party must correctly combine mass struggle, the construction of mass organizations, and the comprehensive completion of the party's comprehensive two-year plan, adhere to the working method of walking on two legs, further carry forward the glorious tradition of the Japanese Communist Party as in the past, and strive with all our strength to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous Japan, to form a strong national democratic united front, and to strive to build a strong party with hundreds of thousands of members."

    日共总书记宫本显治谈新年展望
    日本人民斗争将在新的一年中出现高潮
    现代修正主义追随美国的路线助长了美国对越南的侵略
    “日苏合作”是为了联合美帝加紧推行“遏制中国”的政策
    新华社十六日讯　东京消息：日共中央总书记宫本显治在新年前夕发表谈话，谴责美国在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”阴谋的同时，准备扩大侵越战争，并且揭露佐藤政府和现代修正主义者进行“日苏合作”。
    《赤旗报》一月一日全文刊载了宫本显治的谈话。这篇谈话是答复《赤旗报》记者提出的问题的。
    宫本在答复关于国内外形势的特点的问题时说：“美帝国主义残暴地扩大侵略越南的战争，最近甚至公开扬言要侵略柬埔寨，对此，英勇不屈的越南人民的斗争和国际反帝和争取和平的斗争，虽然存在着复杂的情况，但是取得了发展。而且，最近，以赫鲁晓夫、然后以赫鲁晓夫继承者为首的人们所执行的追随美国的机会主义路线大大破产，修正主义者也不得不采取两面政策，因为象过去那样公开美化帝国主义的做法已经变得困难了。”
    宫本指出，佐藤内阁在这期间，支持美国侵略越南、强行批准“日韩条约”，已经走上凶暴的政治反动化的道路。日本人民和民主力量为反对这些政策，进行了在反对日美“安全条约”斗争以后的最大规模的斗争。他指出，人民和民主力量的巨大愤怒的暗流虽然会碰到各种波折，可是今年的斗争仍有继续全面发展的条件和趋势。国内外形势仍将是一个继续紧张的局面。
    他说，在这种形势下，我们必须坚持“四面旗帜”（编者按：“四面旗帜”是日本共产党在一九六二年七月十三日召开的日共八届三中全会提出的，它们是：1、反对帝国主义、反对垄断资本的人民民主革命的旗帜；2、民族民主统一战线的旗帜；3、建设强大的日本共产党的旗帜；4、反对以美国为首的帝国主义的民族解放、和平的国际统一战线的旗帜。），在新的一年继续跃进。
    宫本在谈到越南的形势时说：“美国侵略越南，是非正义的侵略战争，必须受到应得的惩罚。美帝国主义遭到越南人民顽强不屈的抵抗，已经陷入泥坑。为了摆脱这种困境，它正在一面准备把战争扩大到整个印度支那，对中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动新的侵略，一面玩弄‘无条件谈判’、
  ‘在目前情况下停火’等各种各样的花招。”他说，“我们坚信，不管怎样，越南人民将取得最后胜利，美帝国主义及其追随者将遭到最后失败。”
    他说：“对于越南人民奋起打击美国侵略者的事实，对于越南人民的英勇斗争，必须给予很高的评价。”
    宫本还指出：“目前的局势是，美国侵略者不仅公然扩大对南越的侵略，而且日复一日地侵略站在世界社会主义体系的亚洲前哨的社会主义国家的领土，反复进行那样残忍横暴的轰炸，而且正在准备扩大新的侵略。”
    宫本说：“美国侵略越南是出于美帝国主义者的侵略本性，但是也很明显，他们采取犯罪行为也有他们的如意算盘。”
      “关于这一点，首先，由于从赫鲁晓夫上台以来的国际现代修正主义潮流执行追随美帝国主义的路线，美帝国主义越来越坚定地认为可以小看社会主义阵营，并且可以指望其中有一定部分变成机会主义，可以各个击破社会主义国家。而且，赫鲁晓夫等人的机会主义路线在很长时期里非常严重地削弱了各国人民有效地进行反对美帝国主义的斗争的体制。还有，去年三月一日，苏共领导强行召开它片面召集的会议而造成了使国际共产主义运动更难于团结的局面。这也助长了美国侵略者企图各个击破的野心。这些就是形成上述局势的基础。
    “从以上各点来看，很明显，为了立即给美帝国主义以同侵略、战争势力和反帝、和平力量之间本来的国际力量对比相称的有效的打击，重要的是要克服一切机会主义、大国主义和分裂主义的潮流，实现国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义基础上的真正团结。还有，重要的是，在上述目标还不能完全实现的情况下，也要在事实上组织为反对美帝国主义侵略越南而斗争的国际统一行动，尽早地坚决打击美帝国主义利用社会主义阵营和国际民主、和平力量的不团结而无耻地继续采取并且
  扩大残暴的强盗行为的图谋。这首先不仅从加强反对美帝国主
  义的斗争方面来说是国际上的当务之急，而且从通过实践克服
  国际共产主义运动和国际和平民主运动内部的机会主义潮流方
  面来说，也是重要的。”
      宫本说，“我们认为，为了尽早打败美国侵略者非法到极点
  的阴险毒辣的侵略，而且为了尽量减少越南人民的牺牲而取得
  胜利，必须用尽一切办法加强国际反帝、和平运动的战线。
      “我们日本共产党还认为，必须进一步加强邻近越南的亚
  洲马克思列宁主义的共产党之间进行联合斗争的体制，以反对美帝国主义侵略越南和亚洲，支援正在同美帝国主义斗争的越
  南人民和亚洲人民。”
      宫本说：“美帝国主义正在进行无耻的欺骗宣传，说什么美
  国在越南进行的侵略‘是为了阻止中国侵略越南而采取的正义行动’。美国副总统汉弗莱等人在去年十一月会见《朝日新闻》记者秦（正流）的时候曾经竭力这样强调。需要反复地向日本人民揭露，这种欺骗性的议论、他们的‘无条件谈判’的姿态的本质是要求在事实上让他们自由地把对南越的侵略固定下来，把南越从北越分割出去，变为美国的附属国、殖民地。
      “同时，需要进一步加强我国的支持越南委员会的活动，需要更加强烈地呼吁日本人民尽可能地给予越南人民以精神的和物质的支援。
      “越南人民一再发表声明说，他们即使花十年、二十年的时间，也一定要战斗到把美国赶出去为止。我们日本人民，今年也必须和世界反帝、和平力量联合起来，为把美帝国主义尽早地从越南和整个亚洲地区赶出去而奋斗。”
    宫本还谈到了反对“日韩条约”斗争以后的形势的特点。他指出，由于民主力量的奋斗，佐藤政府在用粗暴的行动强行通过“日韩条约”以后，越来越不稳定了。它企图把“日韩条约”变成既成事实，进一步具体实现“日韩条约”的目标，以克服这种不稳定局面。
    他说，对这一点，“我们要一贯坚持不承认‘日韩条约’的态度，对于他们根据‘日韩条约’采取的具体措施，不断地组织斗争，为日朝两国人民的团结和友好而奋斗，这是重要的。”
    宫本指出：“佐藤内阁在成立当初曾经说过，（解决）‘日韩’问题和日中问题是他们自己在外交方面的任务，但是在最近，在‘日韩条约’签定以后，却把日中问题搁置起来，竭力提倡‘推进对苏外交’。
    “我们党一贯认为日苏两国人民建立正确意义上的友好和缔结日苏和约是加强日本人民和亚洲、世界各国人民之间的友好、实现日本和一切社会主义国家的邦交正常化的一部分。但是，本来是保守反动的反共旗手的自由民主党佐藤内阁，今天突然说要‘推进对苏外交’的意图是什么呢？
    “说要‘推进对苏外交’的目的之一，当然是日本的垄断资本想在经济萧条的情况下向苏联寻找新的海外市场。同时，象人们传说的那样，（日本政府）要在政治上实行在‘稳定的政治路线上’的外交，因此要促进日苏外交，作为‘美苏合作’的一种形式，这样的一种方针，包含有美国和日本统治阶级的企图。这是一个新的特点。
      “以赫鲁晓夫为代表的现代修正主义曾以‘美苏合作’的形式追随美帝国主义，但是，在今天象侵略越南的战争那样露骨的美国的侵略政策面前，再以过去的形式追随美帝国主义，对它实行合作，已经变得困难起来了。
    “于是，美国和日本的统治阶级企图用由美国的忠实属下的同盟者日本和苏联加强友好关系的方式，挽救今天动摇不安中的‘美苏合作’路线，在这个意义上，他们特别重视‘日苏合作’。”
    宫本说：“最近听到莫斯科电台纪念日本加入联合国九周年的广播以后，感到惊讶，莫斯科广播竭力强调‘日苏联合行动’。所谓在国际政治中采取‘联合行动’，当然不仅意味着缔结贸易和交通等单纯业务方面的协定，而且意味着在国际政治路线上追求共同目标。”
    宫本问道：“究竟日本和苏联要在国际政治上按照什么共同目标采取联合行动呢？”
    他指出：“很明显，日本的外交政策的基调是追随美国，而且承认美国侵略越南是对的，并且给予积极支持；其次是敌视中国，敌视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。所谓真正正确的和平共处政策，是要同这种非和平的政策进行斗争来防止侵略战争，而认为同以露骨地追随美国或者采取敌视亚洲各社会主义国家的政策为特征的日本政府的外交政策之间存在基本的共同路线的这种看法，归根结蒂，是要变换一种形式，对日本反动统治阶级实行那种追随美帝国主义并且同美帝国主义妥协的政策。”
    宫本说：“在‘日韩’问题以及其他许多问题上，苏联的新闻机关也曾经发表过批评日本政府的论调，但是，从最近半年来莫斯科广播电台等整个情况来看，却是不断无原则地追随和美化自由民主党政府追随美国、复活军国主义和帝国主义的基本路线，说什么‘对于日本在这几年里为了恢复它在亚洲国家中的信赖和威信而有系统地进行的工作，不能不表示赞同’，采取这种做法不仅使日本的统治阶级洋洋得意，而且在日本人民中间散布了错误的看法。
      “而且，自赫鲁晓夫以来的现代修正主义者为了孤立日本共产党，分裂日本民主力量一直进行种种阴谋活动。
      “在这样一种情况下，本来反共的日本统治阶级便考虑了各种各样的条件，着手‘推进对苏外交’，并且以得到美帝国主义者大力支持的‘稳定的政治路线’的形式来采取这种做法。
      “佐藤内阁继承了历届反动内阁的传统，对中国——日本过去曾经对它发动过最不能容许的长期侵略战争并且进行了破坏活动——仍然没有恢复邦交，并且同美帝国主义的
  ‘遏制中国’政策实行合作，支持它侵略越南，在这样一种情况下一面‘推进对苏外交’，煞有介事地摆出‘向前看的姿态’，一面试图消除‘日韩条约’给人留下的种种反民主的印象，谋求长期稳定地掌握反动政权。”
      “我们赞成不同社会制度国家实行正确意义上的和平共处，（日本要）同所有国家恢复邦交，我们党的纲领也明确地这样说。但是，我认为，现在美帝国主义推行着那种侵略政策，而且日本政府又露骨地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，在这种情况下，我们对社会主义阵营所期待的是：不要对美国和美国的同盟者采取无原则的追随政策，而应该采取正确地提高日本人民和世界人民对他们的侵略和反动政策的警惕性的外交路线。我们必须正确地看穿自由民主党佐藤内阁‘推进对苏外交’的重要动机之一，是要在今天把这种做法当作‘遏制中国’的一种战术。应当进一步加强在正确意义上的日苏两国人民友好和推进缔结日苏和约的运动以及要求恢复日中邦交的运动。”
    他说，垄断资本和（日本）政府把克服经济萧条的出路放在加紧剥削和掠夺人民、加强劳动强度、解雇职工等方面。在这种情况下，工人阶级已经处于必须同广大各阶层人民的政治斗争、维护生活的斗争联合起来，为保卫自己的生活和权利而奋斗的状态。今后，把政治斗争同经济斗争结合起来的民主力量的联合斗争和打倒佐藤内阁、迫使解散国会的斗争，将会越来越迫切而且具有更重要的意义。
    宫本接着谈到了日本民主力量的联合斗争和日本共产党的作用和任务问题，他说：“在新的一年，民主力量的联合，共产党、社会党和公明党等在野党力量的联合斗争，都将出现一个高潮。为了迎接这样一个高潮的到来，必须坚持不懈地同来自右翼分裂势力和反党修正主义者在思想方面的和实际行动方面的形形色色的阻挠进行坚决斗争。日本共产党为了发展日本人民所需要的联合斗争，愿意认真地竭尽全力。”他说，“我们的党作为坚持马克思列宁主义的党，一贯坚持从理论上和政治上同主要危险的现代修正主义进行不妥协的斗争，同时也防止产生教条主义。今年也将进一步忠实地遵守这一条，同时也将为加强反对美帝国主义的国际反帝统一战线而贡献力量。”
    宫本最后说：“现在，从世界和亚洲的形势来看，我们日本共产党，无论是在群众斗争方面，也无论是在党的建设方面，都担负着非常重要的历史使命。在新的一年中，全党要把群众斗争、群众组织的建设和全面完成党的综合两年计划三者正确地结合起来，坚持两条腿走路的工作方法，和去年一样，进一步发扬日本共产党的光荣传统，为建立独立、民主、和平、繁荣的日本，为结成强大的民族民主统一战线，为争取建成拥有几十万党员的强大的党而全力奋斗。”
