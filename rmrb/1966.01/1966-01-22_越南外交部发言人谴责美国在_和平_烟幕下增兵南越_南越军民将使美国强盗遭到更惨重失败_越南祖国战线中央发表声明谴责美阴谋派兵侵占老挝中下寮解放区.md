    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 21st—The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 21st, strongly condemning the US government for continuing to send additional troops to South Vietnam under the guise of a "peace talk" conspiracy.
    The statement said that the Vietnamese people sternly warn US imperialism: no army of the American aggressors can save them from their plight in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese people and the heroic Liberation Army will continue to inflict even more terrible defeats on the American aggressors.
    The statement said that on January 18, the United States sent approximately 9,000 combat troops to South Vietnam. Thus, in just one month since the Johnson administration launched its new fake "peace" offensive, it has sent approximately 13,000 US combat troops to South Vietnam. Currently, the total number of US expeditionary forces in South Vietnam has increased to over 200,000. This does not include the 70,000 US troops belonging to the Seventh Fleet who directly participate in the Vietnam war every day, the US Air Force stationed in Guam and Thailand, and 20,000 troops from South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.
    The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of the United States once again reveal the nature of the so-called "seeking peace" conspiracy that the Johnson administration has been vigorously promoting in recent weeks. Obviously, the US government is using deceptive means to cover up its conspiracy to intensify and expand the criminal war in South Vietnam.
    The statement said that on January 12, President Johnson, in his State of the Union address to the US Congress, emphasized that the United States "will not retreat" and "must stay" in South Vietnam. Subsequently, sending additional US troops to South Vietnam and requesting an increase in the budget for the Vietnam war further exposes the extremely despicable aggressive face of US imperialism to world public opinion.
    The statement strongly condemned the new aggressive actions of the US government. It also demanded that the US government must respect and strictly implement the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue, must stop its aggression against South Vietnam, withdraw all US and its lackey troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and let the South Vietnamese people solve their own affairs; at the same time, the United States must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other war actions.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 20th, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on the 20th, strongly condemning US imperialism's conspiracy to directly send troops to invade the liberated areas of central and lower Laos, and expressed its full support for the statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on January 17.
    The statement said that the Johnson administration's plan to send US troops to occupy Laos is inseparable from its long-established conspiracy to strengthen and expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina. It has been and is sending large numbers of US troops to South Vietnam; continues to use the air force to conduct reconnaissance and provocation against North Vietnam, preparing for a new "escalation" of the destruction of North Vietnam; and arrogantly announced that it has authorized US troops to infringe upon Cambodian territory at any time. Obviously, US imperialism is taking the road of extremely dangerous new military adventures, creating an extremely serious crisis, attempting to turn the countries of Indochina into a battlefield.
    The statement said that US imperialism's conspiracy to directly occupy the central and lower Laos regions as a strategic bridgehead connecting South Vietnam and Thailand is an attempt to use the central and lower Laos regions as a base for expanding its war of aggression and annexing Laos, while opposing the Vietnamese people and undermining the independence and neutrality of Cambodia.
    The statement concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people are determined to unite closely with the fraternal Lao people and Cambodian people, and resolutely defeat the US imperialism's conspiracy to strengthen and expand the Indochina war, so as to defend the sacred national rights of the three peoples and safeguard peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    越南外交部发言人谴责美国在“和平”烟幕下增兵南越
    南越军民将使美国强盗遭到更惨重失败
    越南祖国战线中央发表声明谴责美阴谋派兵侵占老挝中下寮解放区
    新华社河内二十一日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十一日发表声明，强烈谴责美国政府在“和谈”阴谋的掩盖下，继续向越南南方增派侵略军。
    声明说，越南人民严厉警告美帝国主义：美国侵略者的任何军队都挽救不了他们在越南南方的危困局面。南越人民和英雄的解放军将继续使美国侵略者遭到更加惨重的失败。
    声明说，一月十八日，美国又向越南南方增派约九千名战斗部队。这样，仅在约翰逊政府进行新的假“和平”攻势以来的一个月内，它就向越南南方增派了约一万三千名美国战斗部队。目前，在南越的美国远征军总数已经增加到二十万人以上。这还不包括每天直接参加越南作战的属于第七舰队的七万名美军和驻在关岛、泰国的美国空军，以及二万名南朝鲜、澳大利亚和新西兰的军队在内。
    声明指出，美国的上述行动，再一次揭露了约翰逊政府在最近几周中大肆宣扬的所谓“谋求和平”阴谋的本质。很明显，美国政府正在利用欺骗手段来掩盖它强化和扩大越南南方罪恶战争的阴谋。
    声明说，一月十二日，约翰逊总统在美国国会宣读的国情咨文中强调美国在南越“决不退让”，“一定要留下来”。接着，又向越南南方增派美军和要求增加越南战争的预算，这就向世界舆论进一步揭穿了美帝国主义的极其卑鄙的侵略面目。
    声明强烈谴责美国政府的新的侵略行动。并且要求美国政府必须尊重和严正履行一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，必须停止侵略越南南方，把美国及其仆从的军队和武器全部撤出越南南方，让南越人民自己解决自己的事务；同时美国必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其它一切战争行动。
    据新华社河内二十日电越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团二十日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义阴谋直接派兵侵占老挝中寮和下寮解放区，并表示完全支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一月十七日的声明。
    声明说，约翰逊政府派遣美军侵占老挝的计划是同它早已制订的把侵略战争加强和扩大到整个印度支那的阴谋分不开的。它已经和正在向越南南方增派大批美军；继续使用空军对越南北方进行侦察、挑衅，为破坏越南北方的新的“升级”作准备；蛮横地宣布授权美军在任何时候都可以侵犯柬埔寨领土。很显然，美帝国主义正在走着极其危险的新的军事冒险的道路，造成了极其严重的危机，企图把印度支那各国变为一个战场。
    声明说，美帝国主义直接侵占老挝中寮和下寮地区作为连接越南南方和泰国的战略桥头堡的阴谋，是企图用中寮和下寮地区作为它扩大进行侵略战争的基地并吞并老挝，同时来反对越南人民和破坏柬埔寨的独立和中立。
    声明最后说，越南人民决心同兄弟的老挝人民、柬埔寨人民紧密团结在一起，坚决挫败美帝国主义加强和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，以保卫三国人民的神圣民族权利，保卫东南亚和世界的和平。
