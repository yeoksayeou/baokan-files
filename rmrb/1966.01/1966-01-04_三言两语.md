    Brief Comments
    On New Year's Eve, the American people used airplanes to distribute leaflets opposing the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is a new creation in the American people's anti-war movement.
    American imperialism has long lost its "air superiority" on the South Vietnamese battlefield. It seems that its "air superiority" on the domestic front is also being lost.

    According to the *Washington Post*, Johnson, because his attempt to play the "peace talks" trick failed,
  "has become easily irritable."
    It is entirely understandable that Johnson is in a disturbed mood; it is a case of being ashamed into anger. However, what good can being irritable do other than revealing one's predicament?
    However, Johnson's mental state is worth noting because, according to psychopathology, a person's irascible nature, if it develops, will turn into madness.

    Indian Defense Minister Chavan said that Pakistan's reliance on China's friendship is "stupid."
    Chavan's intention in saying this is very obvious, which is to attempt to alienate the friendship between the people of Pakistan and China. However, if the likes of Chavan think that their clumsy divisive tricks can succeed, then they are truly stupid to the extreme.

    三言两语
    元旦之夜，美国人民用飞机散布反对侵越战争的传单。这是美国人民反战运动中斗争方式的一种新创造。
    美帝国主义早就在南越战场上失去了“空中优势”，看来它在国内战线上的“空中优势”也正在丧失。

    据《华盛顿邮报》报道，约翰逊因为玩弄“和谈”骗局未能得逞，
  “变得容易发脾气了”。
    约翰逊的心绪烦躁，是完全可以理解的，所谓恼羞易成怒也。但是，发脾气除了表明自己的窘困之外，又能有什么用处呢？
    不过，约翰逊的这种精神状态却值得注意，因为根据精神病理学，一个人性情暴躁，发展下去就会变为疯狂。

    印度国防部长恰范说，巴基斯坦信赖中国的友谊是“愚蠢的”。
    恰范说这种话的用意是十分明显的，那就是企图离间巴中两国人民的友谊。但是，恰范之流如果认为他们这种拙劣的挑拨伎俩可以得逞，那才真正是愚蠢透顶了。
