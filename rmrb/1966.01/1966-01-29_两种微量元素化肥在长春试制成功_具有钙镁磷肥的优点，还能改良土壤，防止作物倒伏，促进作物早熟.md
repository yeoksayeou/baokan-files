    Two Types of Trace Element Fertilizers Successfully Trial-produced in Changchun
    Have the advantages of calcium, magnesium and phosphate fertilizer, and can also improve the soil, prevent crop lodging, and promote crop precocity
    (Xinhua News Agency, Changchun) Two kinds of trace element fertilizers—ammonium molybdate and boron-calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer—have been produced in Changchun.
    Crops need to absorb a variety of nutrients during the growth process. The largest amounts are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but trace elements such as boron, molybdenum, and magnesium also have special effects on crop growth. Farm manure contains a small amount of trace elements.
    Agricultural ammonium molybdate produced by Changchun Reagent Factory can strengthen the nitrogen fixation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. Large-scale trials in Jilin Province in recent years have shown that mixing soybean seeds with ammonium molybdate or spraying ammonium molybdate in the early flowering stage of soybeans only requires 20 grams per hectare, costing only 40 cents, and soybean production can be increased by 5% to 10%. At present, Changchun Reagent Factory is rushing to produce ammonium molybdate fertilizer to meet the needs of soybean production in Northeast China this year.
    The boron-containing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer newly produced by Changchun Chemical Plant No. 1 not only has the advantages of ordinary calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, but also can improve the soil, prevent crop lodging, and promote crop precocity. Applying this fertilizer can increase the absorption of other nutrients by crops and increase crop yields. Long-term fertilizer efficiency tests have shown that the application of boron-containing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer can increase the production of soybeans and rice by about 10%.

    两种微量元素化肥在长春试制成功
    具有钙镁磷肥的优点，还能改良土壤，防止作物倒伏，促进作物早熟
    据新华社长春电　长春市制成了两种微量元素肥料——钼酸铵和硼钙镁磷肥。
    农作物在生长过程中，需要吸收多种养分，其中大量的是氮、磷、钾，但是微量的硼、钼、镁等元素对于农作物的生长也有特殊作用。在农家肥料里，就含有少许的微量元素。
    长春试剂厂生产的农用钼酸铵，可以加强土壤中固氮菌的固氮作用。吉林省近年来大面积试用结果表明，用钼酸铵拌大豆种或在大豆开花初期喷洒钼酸铵，每公顷土地只要施用二十克，成本只花四角钱，大豆就可以增产百分之五到百分之十。目前，长春试剂厂正在赶制钼酸铵化肥，以便满足今年东北地区大豆生产的需要。
    长春市化工一厂新制成的含硼钙镁磷肥，除了具备一般钙镁磷肥的优点以外，还能改良土壤、防止作物倒伏、促进作物早熟。施用这种肥料，可以增加农作物对其他营养物质的吸收，提高农作物的产量。经过较长时间的肥效试验表明，施用含硼钙镁磷肥的大豆和水稻，都可增产百分之十左右。
