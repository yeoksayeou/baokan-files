    What is Individual Life and Death?
    I realized the relationship between sheep herding and the revolutionary cause. Herding for the revolution requires not fearing difficulties and daring to undertake the most difficult tasks.
     Wulalbai, Veterinarian of the Second Brigade, Fifth Commune, Tekes County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

    I was born into a poor herdsman family in the Tekes grasslands. As soon as I could remember, I followed my father herding. In the old society, in those days of dark clouds, I lived a miserable life of semi-starvation with my father. Since the sunshine of Chairman Mao shone upon the Tekes grasslands, my family's life has become happier day by day. With the leadership of the Party, I, a child of a poor herdsman, also had the opportunity to go to school and become an educated person.

    After graduating from elementary school, I decided to stay in my hometown and participate in productive labor, taking the herding whip from my father and herding sheep in the Second Brigade of the Fifth Commune in Tekes County. In the beginning, my father told me: "The commune's sheep are our lifeline. You must not be careless when herding!" I kept my father's words in my heart.

    In 1964, I participated in the Socialist Education Movement. Through the class education of recalling bitterness and thinking about sweetness, I further understood many revolutionary principles and began to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's books gave me boundless strength. I studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" over and over again. My eyes became brighter, and I could see further. I realized the relationship between sheep herding and the revolutionary cause. Herding for the revolution requires not fearing difficulties and daring to undertake the most difficult tasks, and tempering oneself in arduous work.

    In January 1964, the Northern Xinjiang region was in the season of thousands of miles of ice and snow. Our commune's Second Brigade faced difficulties with the grain rations for the fifty-three people and the salt for the more than four thousand livestock overwintering in Baozha Deer. In fifteen days, people would run out of food, and the livestock would be in danger of dying. Sending someone back to the brigade's location—Haladala—to get grain required passing through an ice mountain, with cliffs on both sides of the summit and only thirty centimeters of walking space in the middle. Passing through here was extremely dangerous if encountering a snowstorm. What should we do? The captain convened a meeting of commune members. After discussion, they gave this arduous and glorious task to me, Yilahong, and Tuluxunhan. I was very happy to hear this and immediately said: "Resolutely complete it!" That evening, the three of us set off with twelve oxen and one horse. This time, we encountered rare good weather and passed the ice mountain smoothly in six days, arriving at the brigade. But things were not going well, and the necessary supplies were not yet ready. The brigade party branch actively organized forces to grind flour and buy salt. It was more than ten days later when we were going back.

    We hurried back with anxious hearts. On the third night, we arrived at Aketuohu. This place was still a day's journey from the foot of the mountain, so we stayed in a herdsman's yurt because there were no other homes further on. I was awakened in the middle of the night by the roar of a gale. I went outside the door and saw that the snow on the ground was already more than an inch thick. I woke up my companions and discussed the matter of traveling. We decided to wait here for a day to let the livestock rest before continuing.

    This day was longer than a year. I was so anxious that I couldn't sit still or eat. Looking at the flying snow outside the window, I thought of the difficult situation of the fifty-plus people without food, and I remembered the heavy trust of the Party and fellow villagers. So I resolutely decided that no matter what the weather was tomorrow, we had to go. After dawn, the three of us pulled the livestock, loaded the grain and salt, and set off into the snowstorm.

    That evening, we arrived at the foot of the ice mountain. The heavy snow had blocked the road, and the cold wind was roaring incessantly. We drove the livestock into the pine forest and stared blankly at the mountaintop. Tuluxunhan said worriedly: "How can we get up this mountain?" At this difficult moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "When our comrades are in difficulty, we must see the achievements, we must see the light, and we must increase our courage." I said to my companions: "We have been out for twenty days. Our family is all waiting for us. We can't stop anymore!"

    The next day, as soon as it dawned, we shook off the snow on our bodies and continued forward. The snowstorm had not stopped, and the snow on the mountain was waist-deep. We faced the wind and snow, holding the probing rod, and moved forward step by step. At midnight, we reached the mountainside about two thousand meters from the foot of the mountain. The slope became steeper, and the snow on the road surface was chest-deep, the air was thin. I felt difficulty breathing, weak legs, palpitations, and shortness of breath. I took a step and stopped, insisted on walking ten more steps, and could not walk any further. I ignored the hunger and cold, wrapped my coat tightly, curled up in the snow nest, and fell asleep. When my companions woke me up at dawn, my hands and feet were already frostbitten.

    I opened the road step by step in front. When we were less than a thousand meters from the summit, the road surface was slightly wider, but the slope was steeper, almost walking with our faces rubbing against the snow. At this time, a three-meter-high snow barrier blocked the road. I slipped down several times when climbing. Just as I sat down to rest, I heard a loud bang, and the three-meter-high and two-meter-thick snow barrier collapsed. The two companions used poles to probe on the snow pile. After half an hour, the probing rod touched my body. They forgot the bone-chilling pain of ice and snow, and used their hands to dig the snow, digging more than a meter deep, and finally dug me out and carried me to the side of the road. I had lost consciousness. I didn't know how much time had passed before I slowly opened my eyes. I wanted to stand up, but I couldn't stand up no matter how many times I stretched my waist and legs. That night, we had to sleep in the open on this mountainside of the ice mountain. They dug a snow nest by the side of the road, carried me in, and the three of us lay down huddled together. The next day, my legs still could not support me. But I remembered Chairman Mao's words, remembered the instructions of the branch secretary, and remembered the fifty-three class brothers in Baozha Deer. I mustered up my courage and said to my companions: "Go, let's continue on the road. Although my feet can't walk, I can still roll down the hillside." We slid down the hillside and climbed over a small mountain.

    Below the small mountain, there appeared a pasture with a few piles of withered grass. We arrived at the pasture. Yilahong and Tuluxunhan were here to graze the livestock, and I returned to the winter camp to make contact.

    I supported my body with my hands and crawled up the hillside, staggering and rolling from the top of the mountain to the bottom. My hands were also cut by the ice slag. Below the hillside was an open meadow, and there was a yurt on the meadow. I recognized that this was the yurt of a livestock team of the People's Liberation Army, only half a day's ride from the winter camp. I used all my strength to crawl towards the yurt. A hundred meters of grassland seemed like a sea. I crawled a few steps and gasped for a while. There was only one thought in my mind: For the safety of the class brothers and collective livestock, as long as I have a breath, I must crawl forward. What does personal life and death matter? It took about two hours to finally crawl across this grassland, crawl to the door of the yurt. At this time, my eyes went black, and I didn't know anything anymore. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army found me covered in ice and snow, with blood on my hands. They carried me to the warm yurt and immediately brought in a medic to rescue me…

    The next day, the soldiers sent me back to the winter camp. The team leaders sent people up the mountain to transport back the grain and salt, and rescued the companions on the mountain.

    After the commune party committee heard the news of my injury, they sent someone to take me to the county hospital to treat the frostbite. Because two toes on my left foot and the muscles of my heel were frozen, I had to have them amputated.

    The party branch, in order to take care of my health, let me be the canteen manager, so I worked with crutches. Later, in order to cultivate me, the Party sent me to the veterinary station to study for half a year. Now, I am already a veterinarian and have honorably joined the Communist Youth League.

    I am twenty-two years old this year, and I will continue to advance under the guidance of the Party. In the future, I will study Chairman Mao's works better, diligently study veterinary business, and dedicate my life's strength to the magnificent socialist cause and to the beautiful grassland!

    个人生死算得了什么
    我认识到放羊这件工作同革命事业的关系。为革命而放牧，就要不怕困难，敢于担当最困难的任务。
     新疆维吾尔自治区特克斯县五公社二大队兽医　吾拉尔拜
    我出生在特克斯草原一个贫苦牧民家庭。刚记事的时候，我就跟随父亲放牧。在旧社会那漫天乌云的岁月里，和父亲一同过着半饥半饱的悲惨生活。自从毛主席的阳光普照到特克斯草原，我家的日子过得一天比一天幸福。有了党的领导，我这个贫苦牧民的孩子，也有了上学的机会，成了一个有文化的人。
    小学毕业后，我决心留在家乡参加生产劳动，从父亲的手里接过来放牧的鞭子，在特克斯县五公社二大队放羊。开始的时候，父亲嘱咐我说：“公社的羊群是咱们的命根子，放牧时千万不能大意！”我把父亲的话记在心底。
    一九六四年，我参加了社会主义教育运动。通过忆苦思甜的阶级教育，使我进一步懂得了许多革命道理，并开始学习毛主席著作。毛主席的书，给我增添了无限的力量。我一遍又一遍地学习了《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等文章，眼睛更亮了，看得也远了。我认识到放羊这件工作同革命事业的关系。为革命而放牧，就要不怕困难，敢于担当最困难的任务，在艰苦的工作中锻炼自己。
    一九六四年一月，北疆地区正值千里冰封，大雪纷飞的季节。我们公社二大队在包扎得尔过冬的五十三口人的口粮和四千多头牲畜的用盐发生了困难，再过十五天人们就要断粮，牲畜就有死亡的危险。派人回大队所在地——哈拉达拉去取粮，中途要经过一座冰大坂，山顶两侧都是悬崖，中间走道只有三十厘米宽。经过这里，如果遇上了风雪封路，就十分危险。怎么办呢？队长召开了社员会议，经过讨论，就把这一艰巨而又光荣的任务交给我和伊拉洪、吐鲁逊汗三人去完成。我听了，非常高兴，当场表示：“坚决完成！”当天傍晚，我们三个人赶着十二头牛，一匹马上了路。这次遇上了罕见的好天气，走了六天，就顺利地通过了冰大坂，到了大队。可是事情不凑巧，所需要的东西还没有准备好。大队党支部积极组织力量磨面、买盐。我们往回走的时候，已经是十来天以后了。
    我们怀着焦急的心情往回紧赶。第三天晚上，我们到达阿克脱胡。这地方离山脚下还有一天的路，因为再赶就没有人家了，于是就住在一个牧民的毡房里。睡到半夜，狂风的吼声把我惊醒。我走到门外一看，地下的积雪已有一寸多厚，我叫醒了伙伴，商量赶路的事，决定在这里等一天，让牲畜休息一下再走。
    这一天比一年还长。我急得坐不住，吃不下。眼望着窗外的飞雪，我想到了五十多口人没有粮吃的困难情景，想起了党和乡亲们的重托，便毅然决定，不管明天是什么天气，一定要走。天亮后，我们三个人拉过牲口，驮好粮盐，顶着风雪上路了。
    当天晚上，我们到达了冰大坂的山脚下，大雪已经封了路，寒风不住地吼着。我们把牲口赶进松树林，仰头望着山头发呆。吐鲁逊汗发愁地说：“这山怎么上呢？”在这困难的时刻，我想起了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我对伙伴们说：“我们已出来二十天了，家里人全在等着我们，不能再停了！”
    第二天天一亮，我们抖掉身上的积雪，继续前进了。大风雪依然未停，山上积雪深达腰部。我们迎着风雪，拿着探路杆，一步一步地探路前进。半夜时，我们走到距山脚大约有二千米的山腰，坡更陡了，路面积雪已深达胸部，空气稀薄。我感到呼吸困难、腿软、心跳、气喘。我走一步停一下，又坚持走了十来步，再也走不动了。我顾不得饥饿和寒冷，裹紧大衣，蜷卧在雪窝里就睡着了。天亮了，同伴把我叫醒的时候，我的手脚已经冻伤了。
    我在前面一步一步地开路。当距离山顶不到一千米时，路面稍宽，但山坡更陡了，几乎是脸擦着雪往上走。这时有个三米高的雪屏挡住了道路，我连爬了几次都滑了下来。刚坐下休息时，就听轰的一声巨响，这块三米高、两米厚的雪屏盖下来了。两个伙伴用杆子在雪堆上探，半个小时后，探杆触到我的身上。他们忘记了冰雪刺骨的疼痛，用手扒雪，扒了一米多深，才把我扒出来，抬到路边。我已失去知觉。我不知道过了多长时间，才慢慢睁开眼，我想站起来，但伸了几次腰腿都站不起来。当晚只得露宿在这半山腰的冰大坂上。他们在路边挖了一个雪窝，把我抬进去，三个人挤在一起躺下了。第二天，两腿仍然支撑不起来。但我又想起毛主席的话，想起支部书记的嘱托，想起了在包扎得尔的五十三个阶级兄弟，便鼓起勇气，对伙伴们说：“走，咱们继续赶路。我的脚虽然不能走了，还可以滚下山坡去。”我们滑下山坡，又爬过了一个小山。
    在小山下面，出现了一块露着几堆枯草的牧场。我们到了牧场，由伊拉洪和吐鲁逊汗在这儿放牲口，我回到冬窝子去联系。
    我用双手支撑着身体往山坡上面爬行，恍惚地从山顶上滚到了山下。手也被冰碴子划烂了。山坡下是一片开阔的草地，草地上有一个毡房。我认得这是解放军部队的一个畜牧队的毡房，离冬窝子骑马只有半天的路程了。我使尽全身的力气，向毡房爬去。一百米的草地，象是一片大海，我爬几步喘一会，心里只有一个念头，为了阶级兄弟和集体牲畜的安全，只要有一口气也要往前爬。个人的生和死，算得了什么？大约用了整整两个钟头的时间，终于爬完这块草地，爬到毡房门口，这时我的眼前一黑，便什么也不知道了。解放军的战士们发现我满身冰雪，双手鲜血，把我抬到温暖的毡房里，立即找来了卫生员进行抢救……。
    第二天，战士们又把我送回冬窝子。队领导派人上山运回了粮食和盐，救回山上的伙伴。
    公社党委听到我受伤的消息后，派人把我送到县医院去治疗冻伤。因为左脚的两个脚趾和脚后跟的肌肉都已冻坏，不得不切除了。
    党支部为了照顾我的身体，让我当食堂管理员，我就撑着双拐工作。后来，党为了培养我，又把我送到兽医站学习了半年，现在，我已经是一个兽医，并且光荣地加入了共青团。
    我今年二十二岁，我要在党的指引下不断前进。今后我要更好地学习毛主席著作，努力钻研兽医业务，把毕生的力量贡献给壮丽的社会主义事业，贡献给美丽的草原！
