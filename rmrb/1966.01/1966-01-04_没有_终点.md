    No "Endpoint"
    Last year, some areas of Guangze County experienced a significant increase in production, while others had the same production level as the previous year or a slight decrease. In the past, this would inevitably lead to some people becoming arrogant and others sighing!
    The county party committee organized everyone to study dialectics, using the "one divides into two" viewpoint to look at the problem. The majority of people realized that failure is not the endpoint, but a new starting point for progress; success is even less of an endpoint, but another starting point with higher standards. Thus, the burdens of "arrogance" and "sighing" were shed, and the brainpower machine was started up. The entire county is now summarizing experiences and determined to do a good job in winter production.

    For revolutionaries, there is no such thing as an "endpoint" in the revolutionary cause. Work, struggle, have success, and also have failure. Not being arrogant in victory, not being discouraged in defeat, is the starting point for even greater victories.
    How to treat success and failure is a touchstone for testing revolutionaries. To truly transform both the experiences of success and the experiences of failure into the driving force for progress, the key lies in studying Mao Zedong Thought.

    没有“终点”
    去年，光泽县部分地区大幅度增产，部分地区平产或略减于前年。要在以往，必然是有的人骄傲，有的人叹息！
    县委组织大家学了辩证法，用“一分为二”观点看问题，多数人认识到：失败不是终点，而是前进的新的起点；成功更不是终点，而是另一个高标准的起点。于是，“骄傲”和“叹息”的包袱卸下了，脑子的机器开动起来。全县正在总结经验，立志搞好冬季生产。

    对于革命者说来，革命事业无所谓“终点”。工作，斗争，有成功，也会有失败。胜不骄，败不馁，是更大胜利的起点。
    如何对待成败，是检验革命者的一个试金石。要真正把成功的经验和失败的经验都变成前进的动力，关键在于学习毛泽东思想。
