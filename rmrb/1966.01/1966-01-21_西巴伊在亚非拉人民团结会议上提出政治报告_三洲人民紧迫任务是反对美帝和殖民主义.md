    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th.  Youssef El-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference, presented a political report at the opening meeting on the 3rd.  The first half of this report traced history back several centuries, offering some analysis of the development of imperialism and colonialism, while also discussing the development of the solidarity movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    In discussing the tasks of the Tri-Continental Conference, the report stated, "Opposing imperialism, led by US imperialism, and both old and new colonialism, and achieving and consolidating national independence in the three continents, is a very urgent task for the people of the three continents." The report, in many sections, condemned and exposed US imperialism for carrying out aggression and committing various crimes against the people of the three continents. It pointed out, "US imperialism is the greatest enemy of world peace: the bulwark of old and new colonialism, the bulwark of reactionary forces, and the number one public enemy of the people of the whole world."

    The report condemned US imperialism for intensifying its war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. The report said that while US imperialism is committing intolerable crimes against the Vietnamese people, it is also conducting propaganda about their so-called "unconditional negotiations," making themselves the most abominable.

    The report expressed support for the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's position on resolving the Vietnam issue and demanded that the current conference adopt concrete and effective measures regarding the Vietnam issue.

    The report considers the American invasion of Santo Domingo to be sinful and hateful.

    Regarding the issue of armed struggle, the report believes that "the people of all countries who are subjected to imperialist repression and exploitation have realized that in the current historical situation, that is, under the situation where American monopoly capital exerts pressure and rules everything, thereby blocking legitimate avenues, and imperialism and its servants carry out repression and persecution, armed uprising is an effective way to victory. Therefore, we must support and fully adopt various effective means of struggle, including armed struggle."

    The report said: "If struggling for liberation is the right of the people, then it should be said that this is an unshirkable responsibility for revolutionaries." "The vanguards of the anti-imperialist revolution in the three continents have the obligation to create subjective conditions where there are no subjective conditions, and to plunge into the struggle where popular uprisings have already begun. This is an unshirkable responsibility.”

    When discussing the issues of the times, the report said that the October Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, the vigorous development of the world socialist camp, the increasingly strengthened struggle to break away from colonialism and achieve independence, the liberation of many countries in Africa and Asia, and the Cuban Revolution have changed the balance of power, favoring progress, democracy, socialism, peace, and freedom-loving forces.

    The report also said, "The people of each country must decide their own destiny and never submit to commands that do not conform to their own vital interests... As long as the guardianship of one country over another still exists, the development process that each country must go through is not complete."

    The report pointed out that the victory of the Cuban Revolution is a turning point in the development of the anti-imperialist struggle in Latin America.

    The report said that at this conference, "the idea of uniting to eliminate all forms of colonialism, and the idea of establishing active and permanent connections and mutual cooperation among all countries striving for independence and striving to maintain independence, has become a clear proposition for the first time."

    The report also said, "The fact that struggles in some places are more important than in other places never means, nor will it prove, that struggles in places that are temporarily less urgent should be abandoned, weakened, or relaxed. The struggle is comprehensive and global, and there is no choice. The three continents must be as united as one continent."

    In the concluding section of the report, it said, "The strategy adopted by the revolutionary movement in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, and especially against US imperialism (the main enemy of the people of all countries), requires the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the working class and progressive forces in European and American capitalist countries, and the socialist camp to establish broader ties and strengthen militant solidarity."

    西巴伊在亚非拉人民团结会议上提出政治报告
    三洲人民紧迫任务是反对美帝和殖民主义
    新华社哈瓦那十八日电 亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议筹备委员会秘书长西巴伊三日在开幕会议上提出政治报告。这个报告的前半部分追溯了几世纪以前的历史，对帝国主义和殖民主义的发展作了一些分析，同时谈到了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲团结运动的发展。
    报告在谈到三大洲会议的任务时说，“反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义并在三大洲实现和巩固民族独立，是三大洲人民十分紧迫的任务。”报告在许多段中谴责和揭露美帝国主义进行侵略并对三大洲人民犯下的种种罪行。它指出，“美帝国主义是世界和平的最大的敌人：新老殖民主义的堡垒、反动力量的堡垒、全世界人民的头号公敌。”
    报告谴责美帝国主义加紧对越南人民的侵略战争。报告说，美帝国主义在对越南人民犯下不可容忍的罪行的同时，还进行关于他们所谓的“无条件谈判”的宣传，使自己成为最可憎恶的。
    报告表示支持越南南方民族解放阵线和越南民主共和国政府关于解决越南问题的立场，并且要求本届会议通过关于越南问题的具体而有效的措施。
    报告认为美国入侵圣多明各是罪恶的、并且是可憎恨的。
    关于武装斗争的问题，报告认为，“受到帝国主义的镇压和剥削的各国人民已经认识到，在目前的历史形势下，也就是在美国垄断资本施加压力和统治一切从而堵死了合法途径，而帝国主义和它的仆从进行镇压和迫害的形势下，武装起义是走向胜利的有效途径。因此，我们必须支持并充分采用包括武装斗争在内的各种有效斗争手段。”
    报告说：“如果说为争取解放而斗争是人民的权利，那么应该说这是革命者不容推卸的责任。”“三大洲反帝革命先锋有义务在没有主观条件的地方创造主观条件，在人民起义已开展的地方投身到斗争中去。这是一项不容推卸的责任。”
    报告谈到时代问题时说，十月革命，中国革命，世界社会主义阵营的蓬勃发展，日益加强的争取摆脱殖民主义、取得独立的斗争，非洲和亚洲许多国家的解放以及古巴革命，改变了力量的对比，而有利于进步、民主、社会主义、和平和爱好自由的力量。
    报告又说，“各国人民必须由自己来决定命运，而决不要屈从于不符合它的切身利益的指挥，……只要仍然存在一国对另一国的监护，每个国家所必须经历的发展过程就不完全。”
    报告指出，古巴革命的胜利是拉丁美洲反帝斗争发展中的一个转折点。
    报告说，在这次会议上，“要求联合起来争取消除一切形式的殖民主义，要求所有争取独立和努力保持独立的国家相互之间建立积极的永久的联系和互相配合的想法，第一次成为一种明确的主张。”
    报告还说，“某些地方的斗争比其他地方重要决不意味着，也不会证明应该放弃、削弱或放松在暂时不那么紧迫的地方的斗争。斗争是全面和全局性的，不存在抉择。三大洲必须团结得象一个洲一样。”
    报告在结论部分中说，“革命运动在反对帝国主义、殖民主义、新殖民主义、特别是反对美帝国主义（各国人民的主要敌人）斗争中所采取的战略，要求亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民，欧、美资本主义国家以及社会主义阵营的工人阶级和进步力量建立更广泛的联系并加强战斗性的团结的关系。”
