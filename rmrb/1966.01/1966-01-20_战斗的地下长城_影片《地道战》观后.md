    The film "Tunnel Warfare" profoundly reflects the immense power of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, and the infinite wisdom of the masses. Zhao Village and Gao Village in the film are microcosms of the widespread tunnel warfare during the Anti-Japanese War in the Hebei-Central Plains. The victory of the people's tunnel warfare in Zhao Village and Gao Village is a victory for Chairman Mao's thought on people's war.
    The scenes of the Anti-Japanese War era shown on the screen, like events that just happened yesterday, shook my heart and brought me back to the fiery years of the Anti-Japanese War. It was May of 1942, just as the wheat was ripening and the sorghum was growing tall, when the Japanese devils gathered elite troops from three divisions and two brigades to launch an unprecedentedly cruel "mopping-up" operation against our Hebei-Central anti-Japanese base area. In this Hebei-Central base area, with eight thousand villages and sixty thousand square kilometers, more than seventeen hundred strongholds were established, more than seventy-five hundred kilometers of roads were built, and more than four thousand kilometers of blockading ditches were dug. The sixty thousand square kilometers of land in Hebei-Central were divided into more than two thousand pieces. Bunkers were clustered around the strongholds, and blockhouses were densely lined along the roads. The people were brutally murdered, and their property was plundered by the enemy. The fertile and beautiful Hebei-Central Plains, known as the "Granary" of Hebei, was suddenly ravaged into a world of terror by the Japanese devils.
    The enemy vainly attempted to turn our Hebei-Central anti-Japanese base area into a "supply base for the Greater East Asia War." However, the fantasies of the fascist bandits were completely shattered in the face of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The flames of guerrilla warfare on the Hebei-Central Plains not only were not extinguished, but burned even more fiercely. The eight million strong people of Hebei-Central, under the correct leadership of the Party, with the bold declaration of "rather die standing than live kneeling," and with the fearless revolutionary courage of fearing neither heaven nor earth, launched a life-and-death guerrilla war against the Japanese fascist bandits. According to the topographical characteristics of the Hebei-Central Plains, with the great wisdom and courage of the revolutionary spirit, they created a way out to defeat the enemy, preserve themselves, and eliminate the enemy, and ingeniously created an underground fighting fortress—the tunnel.
    Tunnel warfare—this fighting underground Great Wall, is the product of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. It flexibly strikes the enemy and eliminates the enemy. It leaves the enemy with no target to attack and no battle to fight. One by one, devils and puppet soldiers, shot by militiamen, were killed before they could figure out where the bullets came from. Although the enemy had a huge army, they could be arrogant for a time. However, the enemy's artillery could not harm the militiamen's tunnels, the enemy's tanks could not enter the militiamen's tunnels, and the enemy's planes could not fight tunnel warfare. People's war is invincible. This was the case during the Anti-Japanese War, and it is the case now with the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation. On the battlefield of Vietnam, American warmongers have repeatedly boasted about their so-called "naval and air superiority." But what is so great about that? Their warships, no matter how powerful, cannot go ashore, and their planes, no matter how powerful, cannot fight tunnel warfare. The heroic Vietnamese people have shot down hundreds of their planes, haven't they? Even the F105 "Thunderchief" jet fighter, which they boast as the "king of the air," has been shot down not only by the Vietnamese People's Army, but also by the Vietnamese militia self-defense forces armed with rifles and light and heavy machine guns. This is exactly as Comrade Lin Biao wrote in "Long Live the Victory of People's War": "You rely on modern weapons, I rely on the people's masses with a high degree of revolutionary consciousness; you give play to your advantages, I give play to my advantages; you have your set of tactics, I have my set of tactics. When you attack me, I will make it so you can't hit me or touch me. When I attack you, I will hit you, hit you accurately, and eat you up. If I can eat you up, I will eat you up; if I can't eat you up, I won't let you eat me up either." Historical experience proves that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is invincible, and the people's masses are invincible.
    Now, American imperialism is gradually expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and declaring that it wants to compete with the Chinese people again. If the American imperialists insist on following the old path of Japanese fascism, then we can tell the American imperialists: today's China is neither the China of the Anti-Japanese War period, nor the China of the Korean War period, but a China where the whole people are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to vigorously develop the militia, implement all-out armament, and hundreds of millions of militiamen have taken up arms, forming a vast ocean.
    After watching the film "Tunnel Warfare," it actually gave me a vivid political lesson. It made me further realize that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is a magic weapon for the Chinese people and the people of the world to use for liberation and revolution, and it made me further improve my understanding of the strategic position of the militia. We welcome such films with realistic educational significance.

    战斗的地下长城
    ——影片《地道战》观后
    北京市卫戍区司令部参谋长　魏传连
    《地道战》这部影片深刻地反映了毛主席人民战争思想的巨大威力，深刻地反映了人民群众智慧的无穷无尽。影片中的赵庄和高庄，是冀中平原抗日战争时期广泛开展地道战的一个缩影。赵庄和高庄人民地道战的胜利，是毛主席人民战争思想的胜利。
    银幕上映出的一幕幕抗日战争时期的景象，象昨天刚发生过的事情一样震动着我的心弦，把我带进了那烽火连天的抗日战争年代。那是一九四二年的五月，正当小麦黄熟、高粱齐牛的时候，日本鬼子纠集三个师团两个旅团的精锐部队，向我冀中抗日根据地展开了空前残酷的大“扫荡”。在冀中这块拥有八千个村庄，六万平方公里的抗日根据地里，建立了一千七百多个据点，修建了七千五百多公里的公路，挖了四千多公里的封锁沟。把冀中这块六万平方公里的土地，分割成二千多块。据点周围，碉堡成群，公路沿线，岗楼密布。人民惨遭杀害，财物尽被敌人掠夺。冀中这块富饶美丽，号称河北“谷仓”的大平原，顿时便被日本鬼子糟踏成了一个恐怖世界。
    敌人妄图把我冀中抗日根据地变成“大东亚战争的兵站基地”。然而，法西斯匪徒们的幻想，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民面前，被彻底的粉碎了。冀中平原上的游击战火，不仅没有被扑灭，反而愈燃愈烈。八百万坚强的冀中人民，在党的正确领导下，以宁可站着死，绝不跪着生的豪言壮语，以天不怕、地不怕的大无畏的革命胆略，向日本法西斯匪徒展开了你死我活的游击战争。他们根据冀中平原的地形特点，以大智大勇的革命精神，开创出一条克敌制胜，保存自己、消灭敌人的活路，天才地创造了一道地下战斗的堡垒——地道。
    地道战——这个战斗的地下长城，是毛主席人民战争思想的产物，它机动灵活地打击敌人，消灭敌人。它使敌人攻无目标，战无对阵。一个个吃了民兵子弹的鬼子和伪军，还没有弄清子弹是从哪儿飞来的就报销了。尽管敌人有千军万马，可以骄横一时。但是，敌人的大炮奈何不了民兵的地道，敌人的坦克车钻不进民兵的地道，敌人的飞机不能打地道战。人民战争是无敌的，抗日战争的情况是这样，现在越南人民抗美救国的战争又是这样。在越南战场上，美国战争狂人们不只一次地吹嘘他们的所谓“海空优势”。这又有什么了不起呢？它们的军舰再厉害也上不了陆地，飞机再厉害也打不了地道战。英勇的越南人民，不是成百架的击落了他们的飞机吗？就是被他们夸耀为“空中霸王”的F105“雷公式”喷气战斗机，不但越南人民军击落过多架，就是手执步枪，轻、重机枪的越南民兵自卫队也照样打落了它。这正象林彪同志在《人民战争胜利万岁》一文中写道的：“你依靠现代化的武器，我依靠有高度革命觉悟的人民群众；你发挥你的优势，我发挥我的优势；你有你的一套打法，我有我的一套打法。你打我时，叫你打不到，摸不着。我打你时，就要打上你，打准你，吃掉你。我能吃掉你时就吃掉你，吃不掉你时也不让你吃掉我。”历史的经验证明，毛主席人民战争思想是不可战胜的，人民群众是不可战胜的。
    现在，美帝国主义正在逐步扩大侵越战争，并声言要同中国人民再次较量。如果美帝国主义者一定要走日本法西斯的老路，那么，我们可以奉告美帝国主义：今天的中国既不是抗日战争时期的中国，又不是抗美援朝时期的中国，而是全国人民热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召大办民兵，实行全民皆兵，亿万民兵拿起武器已形成汪洋大海的中国了。
    看完了影片《地道战》，实际上给我上了一堂生动的政治课，它使我进一步认识到毛主席人民战争思想，是我国人民和世界人民用以解放和革命的法宝，使我进一步提高了对民兵战略地位的认识，我们欢迎这样富有现实教育意义的影片。
