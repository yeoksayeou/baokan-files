    The Spirit of "One Horse" Blossoms Everywhere
    The story of "One Horse" is one of the thousands upon thousands of new socialist people and new events emerging in the countryside.
    Since the publication of this deed sparkling with communist thought in the newspaper, the vast number of rural cadres and masses in the Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province have used the communist style of poor and lower-middle peasants in Daliuzhuang and Sangyuan as a benchmark to examine their thoughts, find gaps, and learn from Daliuzhuang and Sangyuan. Many moving stories similar to "One Horse" have emerged.
    Who is the Owner of the Donkey?
    In 1962, Taoyuan 15th Team of Xixiaying Brigade, Xixiaying Commune, Zunhua County, took a cart to the market in Zunhua City and a small donkey foal, less than two months old, followed along; since the owner could not be found at that time, the donkey foal was raised, and now it has become a big donkey capable of doing all kinds of work. After the publication of the "One Horse" story, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the team studied and said, "We must learn from Daliuzhuang, and we must find the owner of the donkey no matter what!" They immediately sent poor peasant member Xu Shan to visit the owner with dry food. Xu Shan set off early the next morning. He asked village after village. In two days, he visited three communes, seven brigades, and more than twenty production teams. Finally, he came to the Shiliopu Brigade, more than twenty miles away, and found the true owner of the donkey. Xu Shan apologized to the Shiliopu production team. The cadres and members of Shiliopu were very moved. They wanted to give Taoyuan two years' worth of fodder and feeding fees. Xu Shan said, "This is the result of the Party's education. We should do this, and there's no question of wages." The masses of Shiliopu accepted the donkey that had been lost for several years with gratitude and expressed that they would learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Taoyuan.
    Also "One Horse"
    The story of "One Horse" reappeared in life. Qianjie Production Team of Jieli Brigade, Lanmazhuang Commune, Funing County, originally had a sick horse known as an "old patient." They fattened it up for a winter and in the spring, they took it dozens of miles away to the suburbs of Qinhuangdao and sold it to the Third Production Team of Bodaowa Brigade for 1,100 yuan. After the story of "One Horse" spread here, the cadres and masses were deeply educated. They said, "If Daliuzhuang can redeem a horse and apologize, why can't we admit our mistakes and redeem the horse?" The mass meeting unanimously decided to learn from Daliuzhuang, send Zhang Dewen and Zhang Dianyuan, the members who originally sold the horse, to redeem the horse and apologize, and recover the impact. They also wrote a letter of apology to the members of Bodaowa Third Team. Like the poor and lower-middle peasants of Sangyuan, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Bodaowa Third Team did not let the members of Jieli redeem the horse, and firmly refused to accept the returned money for the horse, and proposed to change the "old patient horse" to "Friendship Horse" and keep it in Bodaowa as a souvenir.
    When the Rice Seedlings are Damaged
    Due to lack of experience in raising rice seedlings, improper fertilization and water use, most of the fifty mu of rice seedlings of the Second Production Team of Taoyuan Brigade, Luwangzhuang Commune, Funing County, were damaged. After the members of Shahe Brigade, Yuguan Commune, learned of this news, they said, "We can't just manage our own team's production well, we must also care about the production of other teams. Taoyuan is our brother team, and we must bear it as if it were our own team's difficulties." Poor peasant member Li Yanshan said, "My family still has fifty-nine jin of 'Jiumei' late rice seeds, take them to support Taoyuan." Poor peasant member Han Helin also said, "My family still has more than two hundred jin, count them in too!" Soon, more than five hundred jin of late rice seeds were collected, enough to cultivate seedlings for twenty mu of land. At this time, someone said, "We can't let Taoyuan Second Team plant all late rice, that will affect their production increase." So, the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Teams decided to tighten their belts when transplanting seedlings and help Taoyuan Second Team with twenty mu of early rice seedlings. Then, they sent two technicians with rice seeds to Taoyuan to help cultivate seedlings. Later, when it was time to transplant the seedlings, Shahe Brigade sent eighteen good rice transplanters to help Taoyuan Second Team transplant the seedlings. The members of Taoyuan Second Team said with emotion, "We must put in our best effort to cultivate the rice fields well and guarantee a good harvest!" In addition to paying Shahe Brigade for the rice seeds based on the principle of equal value exchange, they also sent two fine-breed pigs to Shahe Brigade.
    Sending Sweet Potato Seedlings to Ensure Full Seedling Survival
    Manjing Brigade of Luwangzhuang Commune, Funing County, bought 30,000 sweet potato seedlings from Hexi Brigade of Yuguan Commune. After the sale, it happened to be a drought. The members of Hexi Brigade were worried that the sweet potato seedlings could not be fully ensured survival, so they asked Captain Wang Shusheng to take the sweet potato seedlings to replant them. After Wang Shusheng arrived at Manjing Brigade, he said to the members of Manjing, "It's dry, our seedlings are tender, and we're afraid they won't survive, which will affect the production increase of the brother team. I was sent here to send you seedlings and replant them." The masses of Manjing were grateful and said, "Oh, we've never heard of selling seedlings and being responsible for replanting. We are extremely grateful for your coming here. The survival rate of the seedlings is quite high." Wang Shusheng said, "We are all farmers, the land is dry during droughts, and the seedlings are tender. How can the survival rate be high?" Later, the masses of Manjing led him to the fields to take a look, and he returned with peace of mind.

### “一匹马”的精神到处开花

专栏：

    这里发表的几篇报道，是一组闪烁着社会主义思想光辉的故事。这是在本报一九六五年七月二十五日发表“一匹马”的通讯以后，各地涌现出来的许许多多类似“一匹马”故事的动人事迹的一小部分。这些故事，生动地反映了社会主义制度下集体经济之间、人与人之间的新型的关系。这种新人新风，正在形成一股强大的力量，推动着社会主义事业不断向前发展。  编者
    “一匹马”的精神到处开花
    “一匹马”的故事，是农村涌现出来的千千万万个社会主义新人新事中的一个。
    自从报纸上发表这一闪烁着共产主义思想光辉的事迹以后，河北省唐山专区广大农村干部和群众，用大刘庄和桑园贫下中农的共产主义风格做标尺，查思想，找差距，向大刘庄和桑园学习，又涌现了许多类似“一匹马”这样动人的故事。
    谁是驴的失主
    遵化县西下营公社西下营大队桃园十五队，一九六二年套车到遵化城里赶集，跟来了一头不满两个月的小驴驹；当时找不到失主，就把驴驹喂养起来，现在已经成了能干全套活计的大驴了。“一匹马”的故事发表以后，队里的贫农下中农经过学习说：“咱得向大刘庄学习，无论如何也得找到驴的失主！”马上派出贫农社员徐山带上干粮走访失主。第二天起早，徐山就出发了。他走一村问一村，两天时间走访了三个公社，七个大队，二十多个生产队，最后来到二十多里以外的十里铺大队，才找到了驴的真正主人。徐山向十里铺的生产队道了歉。十里铺的干部和社员十分感动，他们要给桃园两年的草料和饲养费。徐山说：“这是党教育的结果，我们应该这样做，谈不到什么工钱。”十里铺的群众以感激的心情收下了丢失几年的驴，表示要向桃园贫农下中农学习。
    也是“一匹马”
    “一匹马”的故事，在生活中再现了。抚宁县栏马庄公社街里大队前街生产队原来有一匹号称“老病号”的病马。他们把它养了一冬膘，春天拉到远离几十里以外的秦皇岛郊区，作价一千一百元卖给了拨道洼大队的第三生产队。“一匹马”的故事传到这里以后，干部和群众都受到了深刻的教育，他们说：“人家大刘庄能赎马，能道歉，我们为什么不能去认错、去赎马？”群众大会一致决定，向大刘庄学习，派原来卖马的社员张德文、张殿元二人去赎马道歉，挽回影响，并给拨道洼三队社员写了赔礼的信。拨道洼三队的贫农下中农象桑园的贫农下中农一样，也没有让街里的社员赎马，并且坚辞不受退回的马款，还提出把“老病号马”改为“友谊马”，留在拨道洼作为纪念。
    当水稻秧坏了的时候
    抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队第二生产队，由于缺乏育稻秧经验，使肥、用水不当，五十亩的稻秧大部分都坏了。榆关公社沙河大队社员知道这个消息以后说：“我们不能光管搞好本队生产，还得关心别队的生产，桃园是咱们的兄弟队，咱得象自己队的困难一样来承担。”贫农社员李艳山说：“我家还有五十九斤‘九美’晚稻种，拿去支援桃园。”贫农社员韩合林也说：“我家还有二百多斤，也算上！”很快就凑了五百多斤晚稻种，足够育二十亩地的秧苗。这时候有人说：“不能让桃园二队都插晚稻，那样会影响他们增产。”于是，四、五、七队决定插秧时紧紧手，帮助桃园二队二十亩早秧。接着，他们派了两名技术员，带着稻种去桃园帮助育秧。后来插秧的时候，沙河大队又派了十八名插秧好手帮助桃园二队插秧。桃园二队的社员们感动地说：“我们要拿出最大的干劲来，育好稻田，保证丰收！”他们除了本着等价交换的原则，付给了沙河大队稻种以外，还把两口优种猪送给了沙河大队。
    送薯秧保全苗
    抚宁县卢王庄公社满井大队向榆关公社河西大队买了三万棵薯秧，卖后正赶上天旱，河西大队社员们担心薯秧不能保全苗，就让队长王树声带着薯秧子去给补苗。王树声到满井大队以后，对满井的社员们说：“天旱，我们的秧子嫩，怕栽不活，影响兄弟队增产，派我来给你们送秧补苗来了。”满井的群众听了感激地说：“哎呀，没听说过卖秧子还管补苗，你们这么一来我们就感激不尽了，秧子成活率挺高。”王树声说：“咱们都是庄稼人，天旱地干，秧子嫩，成活率怎么会高？”后来满井的群众领他到地里看了一遍，他才放心地回来了。
