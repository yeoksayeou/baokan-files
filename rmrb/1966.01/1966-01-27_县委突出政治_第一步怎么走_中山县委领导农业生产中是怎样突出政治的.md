    County Party Committee Emphasizes Politics: How to Take the First Step
    How the Zhongshan County Party Committee Emphasizes Politics in Leading Agricultural Production
    Editor's Note: In resolving the relationship between politics and production, and between people and things, why should we place politics and the human factor first, using politics to command production and people to command things? The Zhongshan County Party Committee has realized that whether politics is placed above production or production above politics is first and foremost a fundamental question of leading the masses in a certain direction. If the county party committee leadership fails to recognize this issue at a principled level, they are prone to lose their way in leading production, easily developing a purely production-oriented view, seeing only things and not people. This understanding is worth emphasizing.
    During the Socialist Education Movement, the Zhongshan County leadership initially recognized the significant impact of grasping revolution to promote production through increased production, but lacked a deep understanding of the relationship between politics and production. They sensed something but hadn't yet grasped it. Only when they studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works with this question in mind, analyzing issues, practicing, and summarizing leadership experience according to Mao Zedong Thought, did they gain a further understanding of the relationship between politics and production, and understand the issue more correctly. This is a good experience.
    The Socialist Education Movement launched in rural Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, brought a new atmosphere to the preparation for early rice planting last year. After cultivation began, with the deepening of the Socialist Education Movement, the broad masses of cadres and people adopted a more active attitude towards work and production. Zhongshan County, with a population of over 700,000 and over 800,000 mu of paddy fields, had always considered itself a "large county" and was unwilling to humbly learn from fraternal counties. Now, it changed its previous style and visited other counties several times to learn modestly. The number of participating members was the highest in history, the level of intensive cultivation was the highest in history, and the promotion of advanced technology was the fastest in history. Compared to the abundant 1963 early rice production, the "material" conditions such as water conservancy, chemical fertilizers, loans, and climate were basically the same last year. However, after prominently grasping the "human" factor during the Socialist Education Movement, the same "things" exerted greater effectiveness, with an average increase of 100 jin per mu of early rice, and a total increase of over 100 million jin. The county's average yield reached 450 jin per mu, with one crop exceeding the annual yield before liberation by more than 100 jin.
    The great early rice harvest brought about by the Socialist Education Movement in Zhongshan County powerfully illustrates the significant achievements that can be made in work and production as long as the relationship between politics and production, and between "people" and "things," is correctly handled.
    From the great early rice harvest, the Zhongshan County Party Committee felt the significant role of the "human" factor and political work. However, at that time, they did not summarize the relationship between politics and production, nor did they systematically consider it as a fundamental issue, and the understanding was not conscious enough.
    First, a Matter of Political Direction
    For whom do we produce, who do we rely on to produce, and how do we produce? We are taking a fundamentally different path from capitalism and revisionism.
    Last September, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee issued instructions to "emphasize politics and place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work." Within the entire body of Party members and cadres in Zhongshan County, the County Party Committee, following the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, conducted a major debate and discussion on the relationship between politics and production. After summarizing their own practical experience, the main cadres better resolved the fundamental issue of "emphasizing politics" in terms of understanding. This debate and summary was a necessary supplementary lesson for the Socialist Education Movement. Under the direct leadership of the prefectural party committee, the county party committee convened a meeting of key cadres above the level of brigade party branch secretary, reversing the old method of holding meetings in the past. Instead of having the lower levels report first or the county party committee give instructions first, the county party committee members led everyone in studying several articles from "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," using Mao Zedong Thought as the standard and both positive and negative typical examples as teaching materials, and organized discussions. Having been taught and inspired by Chairman Mao's thought, the county party committee was able to view the relationship between politics and production from the principled height of political direction from the outset. The county party committee summarized everyone's views into four questions: First, what is the purpose and direction of our production? Are we engaged in socialism or capitalism? Second, do we use socialist methods for production or capitalist methods? Third, has focusing solely on production without regard to politics, attempting to boost production with a purely production-oriented view, actually boosted production? Fourth, what are the consequences of leading production with a purely production-oriented view, even if production increases temporarily?
    After the discussion unfolded, both the county party committee comrades and the attending cadres recognized from their personal experiences that the relationship between politics and production is first and foremost a political issue of leading the people in a certain direction, and second, that promoting production through politics yields twice the result with half the effort, while grasping production with a purely production-oriented view yields half the result with twice the effort. Everyone cited the example of the Yuanfeng Brigade Party Branch of the Huancheng Commune. In 1963, this brigade party branch abandoned political leadership, disregarded the national plan, excessively reduced the area of paddy fields, expanded the planting of sugarcane, and pursued profits. Under the stimulation of profits, although cadres and members actively attended work and every household increased their income, the thinking of many cadres and members developed in the wrong direction of harming the public to benefit themselves, and some individuals even developed to the point of unscrupulously seeking exorbitant profits and yearning for the capitalist system. The typical example of Yuanfeng Brigade's production increase and ideological regression vividly illustrates the dangerous path that the guiding ideology of disregarding politics and only focusing on production can lead the masses. A deputy secretary of the county party committee said with deep feeling, "Capitalism also engages in production, revisionism also engages in production, and we also engage in production. What is the main difference between the three? In my opinion, our production has lofty and far-reaching ideals and revolutionary political work. Our production is not only to lay a solid material foundation for communism at a high speed, but also to cultivate new people with communist consciousness for the new society."
    The meeting then specially discussed: "Is emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works a fundamental ideological construction for our Party members and cadres? Or is it a means to complete the current production tasks? What is the difference between the two? Are they unified?" Before the discussion, the cadres' views on this issue were mostly leaning towards the latter and neglecting the former. To this end, the county party committee specially organized everyone to listen to reports by Gao Zuan, Liang Yitian and others on establishing a revolutionary world view in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. Gao Zuan and Liang Yitian are both outstanding grassroots cadres in Guangdong Province who study Chairman Mao's works best. Their deeds of first comparing themselves with Chairman Mao's works, transforming themselves at all times and in all places, and then influencing and uniting the masses to do a good job in production through "personal example" and "verbal teaching" correctly answered the questions everyone was discussing, which was very educational and encouraging. Finally, after further discussion, the distinction between the revolutionary production viewpoint and the purely production viewpoint was clarified, and it was made clear that what we want to establish is the revolutionary production viewpoint of "farming for the revolution," and what we oppose is only the blind purely production viewpoint that does not ask about revolution, does not care about direction, and only cares about production.
    Correcting the Phenomenon of "The Party Not Taking Care of the Party"
    Placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, freeing the county party committee leadership from purely production affairs.
    After debate and summary, the Zhongshan County Party Committee consciously took hold of political work.
    First, the county party committee began to place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. The leading comrades of the county party committee are now studying Chairman Mao's works more conscientiously, and several members of the Standing Committee of the county party committee have begun to use Chairman Mao's ideological viewpoints to solve some practical problems. Under the promotion of the county party committee, more than 300 activists in studying Chairman Mao's works have emerged throughout the county.
    Second, the county party committee has basically been freed from purely production affairs. In the past, several members of the Standing Committee of the county party committee were responsible for production and administrative affairs, but lost sight of ideological and political work. Production and business issues in various units in the county often sought solutions from the Standing Committee of the county party committee, regardless of their size. The comrades of the Standing Committee of the county party committee were entangled in these general production and administrative affairs day and night, and could not handle them all. Why did this situation arise? When discussing the issue, the comrades of the county party committee said that in addition to the lack of deep understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, the main reason was that there were shortcomings in the understanding of the functions of the county party committee today. Before seizing power, what did the county party committee do? Everyone was clear about it; now that we are the ruling party, what does the county party committee do? The views are inconsistent. After discussing "What exactly does the county party committee do?" in several meetings, the comrades of the county party committee clarified: "We are the ruling party. Production is a major issue for the country and a major issue for the people. Of course, the county party committee should lead production and do a good job in production. But we are communists, and it is not correct for the Communist Party to not grasp politics, not grasp the Party, not grasp people, and only study specifically how to plant rice and how to plant sweet potatoes every day, replacing politics with production.
    The county party committee's ability to free itself from production and administrative affairs is also closely related to clarifying the responsibility of the county party committee's number one leader (referring to the county party committee secretary, the same below). "Does the county party committee's number one leader play the role of a commander? Or does it play the role of a political commissar?" After discussion, everyone's views were clarified: "The county party committee's number one leader should play the role of a commander, and even more so play the role of a political commissar. The county party committee's number one leader must of course command the overall situation, but his butt must sit in the chair of political work."
    While solving the problem of understanding, the Zhongshan County Party Committee also made some adjustments and improvements in organization and leadership methods. It strengthened the work of various functional departments, especially the work of the agricultural production leadership department. One deputy secretary of the county party committee is responsible for leading agricultural production; and the county-level leadership organs were streamlined by 40%. The county party committee should let the departments work freely; the departments should also dare to take responsibility and conscientiously take on the work. The Zhongshan County Party Committee is working towards the direction of "centralizing major powers, decentralizing minor powers, the Party committee decides, and all parties handle it." In this way, the county party committee secretary and the members of the Standing Committee of the county party committee can shift their energy to political work and solving major production problems. In the past few months, most of the meetings of the county and commune-level party committees have been studying ideological issues and discussing ideological and political work. The Zhongshan County Party Committee has initially corrected the shortcomings of "the Party not taking care of the Party" and "the Party not taking care of politics." Many rural party branches throughout the county are learning from the county party committee and are also starting to do ideological and political work.
    Third, with the first two points grasped, a new style of work has begun to emerge in the leadership of production by the county and commune-level party committees: when encountering major problems, they can find instructions from Chairman Mao's works, focus on considering issues from the perspective of ideological and political work, and strive to avoid repeating the phenomenon of "discussing things as they are"; the comrades of the Standing Committee of the county party committee go to the countryside more often, and consult with the masses more often when things happen.
    All Work is First and Foremost Political Work
    Raising specific issues to the level of principles, handling affairs according to Chairman Mao's teachings, both solving practical problems and improving political awareness.
    The Zhongshan County Party Committee emphasized learning while using, and flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, trying to solve practical problems with newly learned ideas and methods. Here is an example: After the great early rice harvest in 1965, the question of how to correctly treat accumulation and distribution arose. At that time, the county party committee and most of the cadres considered more about how to strive for self-improvement and how to quickly change the face of Zhongshan County, believing that this was the fundamental way to care for the people, and paid less attention to correspondingly improving the current lives of the members. Therefore, they advocated more accumulation and less distribution, advocating that cadres tightly control the distribution gate and were unwilling to let go of democracy on the distribution issue among the broad masses of members. What about the members? Seeing the great harvest, they hoped that "the brigade would carry out some construction, the production team would carry out some construction, and the member families would also carry out some construction," advocating that the distribution ratio should be appropriate, opposing excessive accumulation, and criticizing "cadres wanting to reach the sky in one step and accumulate without limit"; they were particularly dissatisfied with the cadres' practice of tightly controlling the distribution gate, and put forward the sharp opinion of "Are you in charge or am I in charge?" Therefore, the relationship between cadres and members was somewhat uncoordinated for a while.
    This is a big problem, how to solve it? Some said that the distribution policy had a problem and the proportion of accumulation should be reduced; others said that it would be fine to calculate the accounts and quickly distribute the money; and some insisted on the original practice. The county party committee said, let us take this living issue and first study Chairman Mao's works to see what Chairman Mao said, clarify the issue, and then the amount of accumulation will be easy to handle. At this time, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee also sent instructions on correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and distribution in the summer harvest distribution. The comrades of the county party committee organized the cadres to study articles such as "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Working Methods," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Serious Lessons," and "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," and everyone compared and checked their thinking. The county party committee realized that this was far more than just a distribution policy issue of the proportion of accumulation, it reflected that the county party committee "did not do as Chairman Mao required for the vital interests of the broad masses and the well-being of the masses, "and "could not neglect it at all, and could not underestimate it at all." The county party committee still had a purely production-oriented view, still attaching importance to the "material" factor, attaching importance to capital construction, and not attaching much importance to the "human" factor. It also reflected that there was a more serious erroneous idea among the county party committee and cadres that they did not believe that the people would liberate themselves. In the future, the county party committee would educate the cadres to listen to Chairman Mao's words, and at all times believe in the majority of the masses, and let the members democratically decide on the issue of accumulation and distribution; at the same time, it also promptly opposed the newly emerging "laissez-faire" and "distribute everything" ideas among some cadres and masses, insisted on educating the members with Chairman Mao's instructions on distribution to "take into account all aspects and make appropriate arrangements," and strengthened the Party's leadership over distribution.
    The result of the development of the facts was beyond everyone's expectations. The cadres of the Kuchong Brigade of the Huancheng Commune originally did not dare to let go and mobilize the members to democratically decide on the distribution plan; later, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions to "believe in the majority of the masses," they handed over power to the members and revealed the bottom line, letting the members clarify the accounts of increased production and income in the early crop, the needs of capital construction, the needs of production funds for the late crop and winter planting, and the accounts of debts and credits; and then mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to summarize experience and lessons; at the same time, the branch strengthened the class education of the members. After this, the vast majority of members believed that debts should be repaid, enough accumulation and production funds for the late crop and winter planting should be retained, and then distributed. In this way, the three aspects of the country, the collective, and the individual were all taken care of. Later, the county learned that the proportion of accumulation and distribution determined by the members' congresses throughout the county was mostly appropriate. On the premise that the vast majority of members increased production and income, the total amount of collective accumulation in the county still reached more than 3 million yuan, close to the figures originally estimated by the brigade and team cadres, which was higher than the county party committee expected. The county party committee and the commune party committee deeply realized from this fact the words of Chairman Mao: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are the two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then nothing can be done." The county party committee also understood from the handling of this issue that the long-term interests of the people should be combined with their immediate interests; it also realized that we are engaged in revolution, and no matter what problem we solve, we should not fail to ask about viewpoints and ideas, but only solve it by discussing things as they are. If this issue of accumulation and distribution was simply solved by reducing the proportion of accumulation, then everyone would not be so deeply educated, and the accumulation issue would not be solved well.
    Where is Politics Implemented?
    How is politics implemented in production? There are now three issues before us.
    After the county party committee and the rural grassroots party committees straightened out their understanding of the relationship between politics and production through discussion and summary, what is the next step? Where is it implemented? The responsible comrades of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee said that in the next period, it can be considered to be implemented in three points: First, emphasize politics, study Chairman Mao's works, and establish a revolutionary world view of serving the people wholeheartedly, which is the general program; second, adhere to the policy of self-reliance, hard work, and thrift; third, carry forward the democratic style and follow the mass line. Using these three points to measure the Zhongshan County Party Committee, the general program of "emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works" is still grasped tightly, they have learned more, used more, and have more experience. The Zhongshan County Party Committee has realized the truth that "learning" makes one know one's shortcomings, and "using" makes one know one's shortcomings even more. In the words of the county party committee secretary: "In the past, the purpose of studying Chairman Mao's works was to increase knowledge and improve theory. After reading it, it was over, and it was not connected with reality. Therefore, we could not see its power and could not taste its sweetness. After using it for a while, we tasted the sweetness, and slowly grasped it, and the consciousness gradually improved. We really felt that we must study Chairman Mao's works." However, how can we closely link emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works with the implementation of the policy of self-reliance, hard work and thrift? How can we use emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works to better improve our style? There is still a lack of experience. This issue must be correctly resolved, otherwise "emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works" will be in danger of being suspended. This is the first problem facing the Zhongshan County Party Committee.
    The second question is that emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works is still quite impulsive at present. Can we persist in it for a long time in the future? Will it blow away like a gust of wind?
    The third question is that the county party committee and most of the commune party committees have now moved, but the party branch level of the brigade has not moved well enough, and some have not moved at all. The party branch of the brigade is the fighting fortress of our Party for carrying out political work and leading production in the countryside. If the party branch has not moved well, the political work of a county is not implemented. The county party committee has made some analysis of these three problems and has some experience, and is preparing to study and solve them.
    Zhongshan County is one of the main rice-producing areas in the Pearl River Delta. In 1956, the first production climax in history appeared, and the average annual yield per mu increased from about 300 jin before liberation to 580 jin, which means that production increased by nearly one time during the first seven years after liberation. The period from 1957 to 1963 was the second seven years. During these seven years, Zhongshan County carried out farmland capital construction centered on electric drainage and irrigation station networks, built more than 400 power stations, and more than 90% of the paddy fields had water conservancy facilities. The farming conditions were much better than in the first seven years, but the yield per mu in 1963 was only 756 jin, only a little more than 20% higher than in 1956. Why is this? There are many reasons, the most fundamental of which is the improper handling of the relationship between politics and production. Zhongshan County is close to Hong Kong and Macao, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism, and between two kinds of ideologies, has always been relatively sharp. During the first seven years, political work was better, and the revolutionary spirit of cadres and the masses was strong. Although the "material" conditions in production were not as good as in the latter seven years, the results were twice as good with half the effort, and production and work went up. When the county party committee focused on capital construction in the latter seven years, it ignored political work, so although there were more "things," the revolutionary spirit of cadres and the masses was not as strong as in 1956, and it did not make the best use of things, so production increased relatively slowly. Zhongshan County carried out the Socialist Education Movement, emphasized politics, and production went up again. In 1965, the average yield per mu had soared to 830 jin.
    The Zhongshan County Party Committee has emphasized politics and studied Chairman Mao's works in leading agricultural production for a short time, with not much experience, and there may be twists and turns in the future, but its direction is correct, the effect is good, and the influence will be far-reaching.

    县委突出政治　第一步怎么走
    中山县委领导农业生产中是怎样突出政治的
    编者按：在解决政治和生产、人和物的关系中，为什么要把政治、把人的因素摆在第一位，要以政治统帅生产，以人统帅物？中山县委体会到：是政治摆在生产之上，还是生产摆在政治之上，这首先是一个把群众引向什么方向的根本问题。县委领导如果不能把这个问题提到原则高度来认识，那么在领导生产中，就容易迷失方向，就容易产生单纯生产观点，就只能见物不能见人。这种认识是值得重视的。
    中山县在社会主义教育运动当中，县委领导通过增产的事实，初步看到了抓革命促生产的巨大作用，但是对于政治与生产的关系还没有深刻的认识。他们感觉到了的东西，一时还没有理解它。只有当他们带着这个问题学习毛泽东同志著作，按毛泽东思想来分析问题，来实践，来总结领导经验的时候，才对政治与生产的关系有了进一步的认识，才比较正确地理解这个问题。这是个好经验。
    广东省中山县农村展开的社会主义教育运动，为去年早稻备耕带来新气象。开耕以后，随着社会主义教育运动的深入发展，广大干部和人民群众对工作对生产采取了更积极的态度。中山县七十多万人口，八十多万亩水稻，县委一向以“大县”自居，从不肯向兄弟县认真请教，现在一改以往作风，几次到外县虚心学习。社员出勤的数量是历年最多的，精耕细作的水平是历年最高的，先进技术的推广是历年最快的。去年早稻生产与丰收的一九六三年相比，论“物”的条件，诸如水利、化肥、贷款、气候等，基本相同，但是社会主义教育运动中突出地抓了“人”的因素以后，同样的“物”便发挥了更大的效能，每亩早稻平均增产了一百斤，总产量增加了一亿多斤。全县每亩平均高达四百五十斤，一造产量比解放前一年的产量还多百把斤。
    社会主义教育运动给中山县带来的早稻大丰收，有力地说明了只要正确处理了政治和生产的关系，正确处理了“人”和“物”的关系，工作和生产会取得多么重大的成就。
    中山县委从早稻大丰收的事实中，感觉到了“人”的因素和政治工作的巨大作用。但是，那时对政治与生产的关系，还没有来得及总结，没有作为一个根本问题加以系统考虑，认识还是不够自觉的。
    首先是个政治方向问题
    为谁生产，靠谁生产，怎么样生产，我们同资本主义、修正主义走着根本不同的道路。
    去年九月广东省委发出“突出政治，把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位”的指示。中山县委在全体党员干部中，根据省委指示，就政治和生产关系问题大辩大议，在总结了自己的实践经验以后，才使主要干部从认识上较好地解决了“突出政治”这个根本问题。这次辩论和总结，对社会主义教育运动说，是一次必要的补课。县委在地委的直接领导下，召集大队党支部书记以上的主要干部开会，一反过去开会的老办法，既不由下边先汇报，也不是县委先作指示，而是由县委委员带领大家学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》几篇文章，以毛泽东思想作标准，以正面反面典型作教材，组织讨论。得到了主席思想的教导和启发，县委一开始便能把政治和生产的关系问题提到政治方向的原则高度去看待。县委把大家的看法归纳成四个问题：第一，我们搞生产的目的和方向究竟是什么？是搞社会主义呢，还是搞资本主义呢？第二，是用社会主义的方法搞生产，还是用资本主义的方法搞生产？第三，不问政治只抓生产，想以单纯的生产观点把生产搞上去，生产上去了没有？第四，以单纯的生产观点领导生产，即使生产一时上去了，后果怎么样？
    讨论展开以后，县委同志和到会干部都从切身经历中，认识到政治和生产的关系，首先是一个将人民引往那个方向的政治问题，其次才是以政治促生产事半功倍，以单纯生产观点抓生产事倍功半的问题。大家举出了环城公社员峰大队党支部作例子。一九六三年这个大队党支部放弃政治领导，不顾国家计划，过量缩小水稻面积，扩种甘蔗，追逐利润。干部和社员在利润的刺激下，虽然积极出勤，户户增加了收入，但是不少干部和社员的思想向损公利私的错误方向发展了，个别人竟至发展到不择手段牟取暴利，向往资本主义制度的严重程度。员峰大队生产上升思想倒退的典型事例，生动地说明了不问政治只顾生产的指导思想，会把群众引导向怎样危险的道路上去。一位县委副书记对此深有所感地说：“资本主义也搞生产，修正主义也搞生产，我们也搞生产。三者的主要区别是什么呢？我看，我们搞生产有着崇高的远大理想，有着革命的政治工作。我们搞生产，不只是高速度地为共产主义奠定雄厚的物质基础，我们还要为新社会培养出具有共产主义觉悟的新人。”
    会议接着又专题讨论了：“突出政治，学习毛主席著作，是我们党员干部的一项根本的思想建设呢？还是完成当前生产任务的手段呢？这两者的区别是什么？是不是统一的？”讨论以前，干部对这个问题的看法，多是偏重后一点忽视前一点的。县委为此特地组织大家听取了高钻、梁义田等人关于遵照毛主席教导树立革命世界观的报告。高钻、梁义田都是广东省学习毛主席著作最好的优秀基层干部。他们那种首先对照毛主席著作，时时处处改造自己，然后以“身教”、“言教”影响和团结群众搞好生产的事迹，正确地回答了大家正在讨论的问题，使大家很受教育和鼓舞。最后又经过讨论，划清了革命的生产观点和单纯的生产观点之间的区别，弄清楚了我们要树立的是“为革命而种田”的革命的生产观点，我们反对的只是不问革命，不管方向，只顾生产的盲目的单纯生产观点。
    纠正“党不管党”现象
    把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作首位，把县委领导从纯生产事务中解放出来。
    经过辩论和总结，中山县委自觉地把政治工作抓起来了。
    一，县委开始把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。县委领导同志现在比较认真地学习了毛主席著作，几位县委常委已开始运用毛主席的思想观点，解决一些实际问题。在县委的推动下，全县涌现出三百多名学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
    二，县委会基本上从纯生产事务中解放出来了。县委几个常委过去的情况是，包了生产行政业务，丢了思想政治工作。县里各个单位的生产和业务问题，往往事无巨细，都找县委常委解决。县委常委同志日夜纠缠在这些一般的生产行政事务中，办不胜办。为什么形成这种状况？县委同志讨论时说，除了对毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的指示理解不深以外，主要是对县委今天的职能认识上有缺点。夺取政权以前，县委是干什么的？大家是明确的；现在我们是执政党，县委是干什么的？看法就不一致了。中山县委在几次开会讨论了“县委究竟是干什么的”以后，县委同志才明确了：“我们是执政党。生产是国家大事，人民大事，县委当然应该领导生产，把生产搞好。但我们是共产党，共产党不抓政治，不抓党，不抓人，天天只是具体研究水稻怎么种，番薯怎么种，把生产代替了政治，是不正确的。
    县委能够从生产行政业务中解放出来，还和明确了县委第一把手（指县委书记，下同）的责任有很大关系。“县委第一把手起司令员的作用？起政委的作用？”也是经过讨论，大家的看法才明确了：“县委第一把手要起司令员的作用，更要起政委的作用。县委第一把手固然要统帅全局，但屁股必须坐在政治工作这把椅子上”。
    在解决认识问题的同时，中山县委在组织上和领导方法上也做了一些调整和改进。它加强了各职能部门的工作，特别是农业生产领导部门的工作，县委有一位副书记负责农业生产的领导；又把县级领导机关的人员精简掉四成。县委要放手让各部门去工作；各部门也要敢于负责，兢兢业业地把工作真正担当起来。中山县委是向“大权独揽，小权分散，党委决定，各方去办”这个方向去努力的。这样，县委书记和县委常委，才可能把自己的精力转移到政治工作和解决重大生产问题上来。几个月来县和公社两级党委的会议，大部分是研究思想问题和讨论思想政治工作的。中山县委初步地纠正了“党不管党”、“党不管政治”的缺点。全县不少农村党支部学习县委的样子，也做起思想政治工作来了。
    三，抓了前边两条，县和公社两级党委领导生产中，开始出现了一种新作风：做到了遇到重大问题从毛主席著作中找寻指示，着重从思想政治工作角度去考虑问题，努力避免重复“就事论事”的现象；县委常委同志下乡多了，有事多和群众商量了。
    一切工作首先是政治工作
    把具体问题提到原则上来，按照毛主席教导办事，既解决了实际问题，又提高了政治觉悟。
    中山县委强调边学边用，活学活用毛主席著作，试着以新学到的思想和方法去解决实际问题。这里举一个例子：一九六五年早稻大丰收后，发生了怎样正确对待积累和分配的问题。当时，县委和多数干部对怎样奋发图强、怎样迅速改变中山县的面貌考虑较多，认为这才是从根本利益上关心人民，而对相应地改善社员当前生活关心得较少，因此主张多积累少分配，主张由干部卡紧分配这一关，不愿在广大社员中就分配问题放手发扬民主。社员呢？看到大丰收了，希望“大队搞一点建设，生产队搞一点建设，社员家庭也搞一点建设”，主张分配比例要适当，反对过多地积累，批评“干部想一步登天，积累无底”；对干部卡紧分配这一关的做法尤为不满，提出了“你当家还是我当家”的尖锐意见。因此，干部和社员的关系一时有些不协调。
    这个问题很大，怎么解决？有的说，这是分配政策出了问题，把积累所占比例降下来就行了；有的说，算算账，把钱赶快分下去就没事了；也有人坚持原来的做法。县委说，让我们带上这个活问题先学毛主席著作，看看毛主席怎样说的，把问题弄清楚了，积累多少就容易办了。这时，广东省委也发来了夏收分配中正确处理积累和分配关系的指示。县委同志组织干部一起学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《严重的教训》、《关于农业合作化问题》等文章，大家对照检查了思想。县委认识到这远不只是一个积累所占比例的分配政策问题，它反映了县委“对于广大群众的切身利益问题，群众的生活问题”，没有做到毛主席要求的那样，“一点也不能疏忽，一点也不能看轻。”县委还是存在着单纯的生产观点，还是重视“物”的因素，重视基本建设，不大重视“人”的因素。它还反映了县委和干部中存在着较严重的不相信人民群众自己解放自己的错误思想。以后，县委一面教育干部听毛主席的话，什么时候都要相信群众大多数，把积累和分配问题，放手地交给社员民主决定；一面也及时反对了某些干部和群众中新出现的“放任自流”和“分光思想”，坚持以毛主席关于分配要“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的指示去教育社员，加强了党对分配的领导。
    事实发展的结果，出乎大家的预料。环城公社库充大队的干部，原来也是不敢放手发动社员民主决定分配方案的；后来，按照毛主席“相信群众大多数”的指示，向社员交了权，交了底，让社员弄清了早造增产增收账，基本建设需要账，晚造、冬种生产资金需要账，债权债务账；再发动贫下中农总结经验教训；同时，支部加强了对社员的阶级教育。在这以后，绝大多数社员都认为应当还清欠债，留够积累和晚造、冬种生产资金，然后才分配。这样，国家、集体、个人这三方面都照顾到了。后来县里了解到：全县各地社员大会决定的积累和分配的比例，大部分是适当的。在绝大部分社员增产增收的前提下，全县集体积累总额仍达到三百多万元，接近社队干部原来估计的数字，比县委预计还高。县委和公社党委从这个事实中，深切地领悟到了毛主席说的话：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了”。县委还从这个问题的处理中，懂得了应该把关心人民的长远利益和眼前利益结合起来；也认识到了我们是搞革命的，无论解决任何问题，都不应该不问观点、不问思想，只是就事论事地去解决。这次积累和分配问题，如果只是简单地从降低积累比例去解决，那么大家就受不到如此深刻的教育，积累问题也不会解决好的。
    政治落实到哪里
    政治怎样落实到生产，现在面前摆着三个问题。
    县委和农村基层党委经过讨论和总结，端正了政治与生产关系的认识以后，下一步怎么办？落实到哪里去？广东省委负责同志说，今后一个时期内可以考虑落实到三点上：一，突出政治，学习毛主席著作，树立全心全意为人民服务的革命世界观，这是总纲；二，坚持自力更生，勤俭节约方针；三，发扬民主作风，走好群众路线。用这三点衡量中山县委，“突出政治，学习毛主席著作”这条总纲抓得还是紧的，学得多些，用得多些，经验也多些。中山县委是体会到了“学”而后知不足，“用”而后更知不足这条真理的。用县委书记的话说：“过去学毛主席著作的目的，是增加知识，提高理论，看了就算，和实际没有连在一起，因此看不到它的威力，尝不到它的甜头。这一段用了一下，甜头尝到了，慢慢抓起来了，自觉性逐渐提高了，确实感到非学习毛主席著作不可了。”但是突出政治，学习毛主席著作，怎样才能和贯彻执行自力更生、勤俭节约方针紧紧扭在一起？怎样用突出政治，学习毛主席著作，来更好地改进自己的作风？还缺少经验。这个问题必须正确解决，不然“突出政治，学习毛主席著作”就会有悬空的危险。这是中山县委面临的第一个问题。
    第二个问题是，突出政治、学习毛主席著作，目前还带着相当的突击性。今后能不能长期坚持下去呢？会不会象一阵风那样吹了呢？
    第三个问题是，县委和多数公社党委现在动起来了，但是大队党支部一级还动得不够好，有的还没有动。大队的党支部，是我党在农村进行政治工作、领导生产的战斗堡垒。党支部没有很好地动起来，一个县的政治工作就是不落实的。这三个问题，县委作过一些分析，也有些经验，正准备研究解决。
    中山县是珠江三角洲的主要水稻产区之一。一九五六年出现了历史上第一个生产高潮，每亩平均年产量由解放前的三百斤左右提高到五百八十斤，就是说解放后的第一个七年之间增产了将近一倍。一九五七年到一九六三年是第二个七年。这七年之间，中山县进行了以电动排灌站网为中心的农田基本建设，建电站四百多座，九成以上的稻田有了水利设施，耕作条件比第一个七年期间好了许多，但是一九六三年每亩产量只有七百五十六斤，比一九五六年只增产两成多。这是为什么？原因很多，其中最根本的一条是政治与生产关系处理不当。中山县紧邻香港和澳门，社会主义与资本主义两条道路两种思想的斗争一直比较尖锐。第一个七年间，政治工作较好，干部、群众革命精神旺盛，尽管生产中“物”的条件不如后七年好，但事半功倍，生产和工作便上去了。后七年县委大抓基本建设时，忽视了政治工作，这样“物”虽然多了，但干部群众革命精神不象一九五六年那样振作，没有做到物尽其用，生产就上得比较的慢了。中山县进行了社会主义教育运动，突出了政治，生产又上去了。一九六五年每亩平均产量已猛增到八百三十斤。
    中山县委在领导农业生产中，突出政治，学习毛主席著作，时间不长，经验不多，今后也可能有曲折，但是它的方向是正确的，效果是好的，影响将是深远的。
