    Japan: Facing Difficulties at Home and Abroad
    The Sato Cabinet has welcomed its second new year. Simultaneously with the new year, it has already stood at a new starting point.
    However, the domestic and international situations surrounding the cabinet remain severe. Domestically, the economy is still in a state of serious recession, and there is not even a sign of recovery. Internationally, the Asian situation is undergoing drastic turmoil, such as the intensification of the turmoil in Vietnam. Moreover, within the Liberal Democratic Party, complex movements have already begun to appear regarding the Sato government, which, after forcibly approving the Japan-South Korea Treaty, seems to have finally shown the "end of its political power."
    Therefore, the political situation in the new year will present a state of containing storms. The direction of policies to cope with these difficult domestic and international situations is noteworthy.

    日本：国内外都面临困难
    佐藤内阁迎接了第二个新年。与新年同时，已经站在新的起跑点。
    但是，环绕内阁的国内外形势，仍然是严峻的。在国内来说，经济仍然处于严重萧条状态，甚至看不到景气有恢复的迹象，在国际上说，例如越南动乱加剧等等，亚洲形势正在剧烈地动荡。而且，在自由民主党内部，对于在强行批准日韩条约以后好象终于表现出“达到政治力量的尽头”的佐藤政府，已经开始出现复杂的动向。
    因此，新的一年的政局，将呈现出包藏风波的状态。应付这种国内外困难局面的政策的方向值得注意。
