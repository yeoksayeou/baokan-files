    Recognize the Direction, Be a Conscious Revolutionary
    I understand that the work of a correspondent is revolutionary work, and my heart "disease" is cured. I must take Lei Feng as an example and do my job well.
    After reading the editorial "All Work is for the Revolution," I felt currents of warmth boiling all over my body. The Party's words are so apt and touching! Now I want to tell the Party what's in my heart.
    I am a correspondent from the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Materials, and I joined the army three years ago. At that time, I was overjoyed and deeply proud to be a glorious revolutionary soldier. Ideologically, I was actively seeking progress, and my emotions were so full. Looking back at how I work now, what does it look like? In the year I've been working as a correspondent, I haven't been settled in my work, and a lot of strange thoughts and incorrect understandings have filled my mind. When someone asks me what I do, I say, "Odd jobs," "running errands," regarding the delivery and receipt of documents from revolutionary organizations as running errands, and regarding subscribing to newspapers and printing documents as doing odd jobs. I can't see the greatness in this trivial work, let alone feel the glory of ordinary work. I always think to myself: "Being a messenger is so unpromising, being a revolutionary soldier is so glorious!" Why did these thoughts and incorrect understandings arise? After studying the editorial "All Work is for the Revolution," I realized the reasons for my erroneous thinking: in the past, I didn't connect the work of a correspondent with the national and world revolutionary cause, and I didn't connect it with the long-term revolutionary goal. The editorial has this passage: "Some people think that serving in the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland is doing revolution; participating in the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas, and carrying out the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, is doing revolution. But things like farming, working, raising cattle and feeding pigs, barbering, cooking, working at counters, sweeping streets, hauling manure, being a tailor, playing ball, swimming, seeing a doctor and delivering babies, etc., seem like they are not revolutionary work. Is this view correct? This is not correct. This is because they have not seen that, under today's conditions, work like farming and working is also serving the people and serving socialism, and therefore, is also revolutionary work." This passage seems to be aimed at me, prescribing good medicine for my "symptoms" and curing my "disease." I feel truly indescribably happy! All work is for the revolution, and the work I do as a correspondent, although very ordinary, is no exception.
    The editorial also pointed out that everyone should be a conscious revolutionary. I must recognize this direction, study Chairman Mao's writings even harder, and, with Comrade Lei Feng's conscious revolutionary spirit of being willing to be a screw, do my job well and add bricks and tiles to the socialist edifice!

    认准方向，做自觉革命者
    我懂得了通讯员工作是革命工作，心“病”治好了。我一定要以雷锋为榜样，做好工作
    我读了《一切工作都是为了革命》的社论后，觉得一股股的暖流在全身沸腾。党的话呀，说得这样贴切入心！现在向党说说我的心里话。
    我是黑龙江省物资厅的通讯员，三年前参了军。当时心里乐开了花，深为自己作一个光荣的革命战士而自豪。思想上是积极要求进步，情绪是那样的饱满。回过头来，再看看现在干工作是个啥模样，当通讯员工作一年来，不安心工作，脑子里装上不少怪思想，错误认识。当有人问我做什么工作时，我便说：“打杂的”、“跑道的”，把革命机关的文件传递和收发看成是跑道，把收订报刊和印刷文件看成是打杂。看不到这种琐细工作中的伟大，更感觉不到平凡工作的光荣。自己心里老是想：“当个信差多没出息，革命军人多光荣！”为什么产生这种想法和错误认识呢？学了《一切工作都是为了革命》这篇社论后，才初步认识到产生错误思想的原因，是由于过去自己没有把通讯员工作同国家的和世界的革命事业联系起来，没有同长远的革命目标联系起来。社论里有这样一段话：“有些人认为，当解放军保卫祖国，是干革命；参加城乡社会主义教育运动，进行社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是干革命。而象种田，做工，养牛喂猪，理发做饭，站柜台，扫马路，掏大粪，当裁缝，打球游泳，看病接生，等等，好象就不是革命工作了。这种看法对不对呢？这是不对的。这是因为他们没有看到，象种田、做工这一类工作，在今天的条件下，同样是为人民服务的，为社会主义服务的，因此，同样是革命工作。”这一段话就象针对我说的，针对我的“病症”，下了良药，治愈了我的“病”。心里真有说不出来的愉快！一切工作都是为了革命，我所做的通讯员工作，虽然平凡得很，但也毫不例外。
    社论还指出，人人应该做个自觉革命者。我一定认准这个方向，更加努力学习毛主席著作，以雷锋同志甘愿作一颗螺丝钉的自觉革命精神，做好本职工作，为社会主义大厦添砖加瓦！
