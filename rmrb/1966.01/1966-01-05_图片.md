    Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, the People's Liberation Army is full of fighting spirit; the "Three-Eight" work style is a good tradition, the "Four Firsts" have power.
    Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, Daqing people are full of fighting spirit; in order to dedicate petroleum to the motherland, they dare to explore treasures in the wilderness.
    Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, Dazhai people are full of fighting spirit, changing their appearance through self-reliance, turning poor mountain gullies into granaries.

    毛泽东思想放光芒，毛泽东思想放光芒，解放军个个斗志强；“三八”作风好传统，“四个第一”有力量。毛泽东思想放光芒，大庆人个个斗志强；为给祖国献石油，敢向荒原索宝藏。毛泽东思想放光芒，大寨人个个斗志强，自力更生地变样，穷山沟变粮米仓。阎茂如　杜明岭　步万方
