    Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, in a televised conversation broadcast via Early Bird satellite on the evening of the 23rd, vehemently attacked the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China, and revealed that the United States is in close contact with Moscow, seeking to achieve a "peace talk" scam. He also complained that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies were not doing enough to support the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Reporters from Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, and the United States participated in this television conversation.
    At the beginning of the conversation, British reporter Worsthorne pointed out to Rusk that the U.S. authorities' repeated claims that the U.S. war in South Vietnam was to "defend the South from Northern aggression" and "promote democracy there" were untenable. The U.S. was there "to maintain or preserve the great American empire," and the U.S. "is actually engaged in the imperial mission that we (Britain) engaged in in the nineteenth century."
    In his reply, Rusk reiterated the hackneyed clichés of the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, saying that the U.S. sent troops to South Vietnam "because there was aggression from the North," and "if Hanoi stops what it is doing in South Vietnam, there will be no need for American combat troops there."
    Rusk said that the United States has "obligations" to many countries and regions in the world. He particularly emphasized that if the so-called "aggression" succeeds in South Vietnam, it "will jeopardize the vital interests of the United States."
    Rusk attacked China as the so-called "main source of aggression in the Pacific region" and made war threats against China. He said, "If the main source of aggression in the Pacific region—Peiping—should find that aggression is profitable… the United States will not fulfill its obligations, they will generate policies, ambitions, and appetites that must be satisfied, and will cause even greater problems in the future." "Therefore, we believe that this issue should be dealt with in the clearest way from the very beginning."
    Rusk reiterated the U.S.'s "peace talk" scam, saying, "If they are willing to sit at the conference table and argue differences peacefully, then we will be there, but we cannot accept Hanoi, or Hanoi-Peiping united, or anyone else united... imposing their will on their neighbors by force."
    When a reporter asked Rusk if he thought a solution to the Vietnam War could be formulated with the help of the Soviet government, he replied, "For five years, the United States has made every effort to do so." He said, "Indeed, we are always ready, and in fact have been and are in close contact with Moscow, to explore whether anything useful can be done to move these problems in Southeast Asia from the battlefield to the conference table." He emphasized that the Soviet Union "has some responsibility for maintaining world peace."
    Rusk expressed "great appreciation" for the "political support" given by the British Labor government in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, but he complained that the actual assistance provided by "allies" was "less than we had hoped." He exerted great pressure on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "allies," urging them "not to underestimate the problems we (the United States) face in fighting on the other side of the Pacific while maintaining all our obligations in Western Europe," "We hope to get as much help as possible on these issues, and we also hope that each member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will take care of their own obligations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, do what they should do in their own defense budgets, and take on as much of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's burden as possible." Rusk also asked "allies" to consider sending people to South Vietnam. However, a reporter pointed out to him that the allies did not think the Vietnam War involved their vital interests.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: The New York Times published an article by Baldwin on the 24th, saying that the United States is actively building airports, roads, and increasing reserves in Thailand, preparing to increase troops in Thailand and strengthen the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The article said that there are now more than 13,000 American soldiers and hundreds of American planes stationed in Thailand. American planes—F-105, F-4C, F-101, etc.—have been taking off from five bases in Thailand to attack North Vietnam and Laos. The article pointed out that if the Vietnam War continues, the number of U.S. troops will more than double.
    The article said that army troops account for about one-third of the American military personnel stationed in Thailand. The army troops have been maintaining weapons, supplies, and equipment sufficient to equip thousands of troops. These reserves include hundreds of vehicles and tanks, field artillery, and thousands of tons of supplies.
    The article also pointed out that the American military has been building roads, airports, oil depots, pipelines, and other supply facilities in Thailand. In addition, two large civilian construction companies have already started construction of a large airport near the Sattahip Naval Base in Thailand, which can be used for take-off and landing of all types of aircraft. Another large airport is also planned to be built, and the runways of existing airports are planned to be extended and expanded. It is also planned to build a large shipping terminal near Sattahip or perhaps near Si Racha to berth deep-draft tankers and cargo ships.
    The article said that the United States is also preparing to build permanent American military communication facilities, etc.

    攻击越南中国正义立场　要求苏联领导加紧帮忙
    腊斯克兜售和谈骗局技穷力竭
    美国准备大举增兵泰国扩大侵越战争
    新华社二十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克二十三日晚上在由晨鸟卫星转播的电视谈话中，大肆攻击越南民主共和国和中国，并且透露美国正在同莫斯科密切接触，谋求实现“和谈”骗局。他还抱怨北大西洋集团盟国支持美国侵越战争不力。
    参加这次电视谈话的有来自英国、法国、西德、意大利和美国的记者。
    英国记者沃斯特霍恩在谈话一开始就向腊斯克指出，美国当局所一再宣扬的美国在南越进行的战争是为了“保卫南方免受北方的侵略”和“在那里促进民主事业”等等，实际上是站不住脚的。美国在那里“是为了保持或维护美利坚大帝国”，美国“实际上是在从事我们（英国）在十九世纪所从事的帝国使命”。
    腊斯克在回答中重弹美国侵略越南的滥调，说什么美国出兵南越是“因为有来自北方的侵略”，“如果河内停止它正在南越所做的事情，那里就会不再需要美国的战斗部队”。
    腊斯克说，美国对世界许多国家和地区承担有“义务”，他特别强调，如果所谓“侵略”在南越成功，“就会危及到美国的切身利益”。
    腊斯克攻击中国是所谓“太平洋地区侵略的主要源泉”，并且对中国进行战争威胁。他说，“如果太平洋地区的侵略的主要源泉——北平——竟然发现侵略是合算的……美国将不履行它的义务，他们将会产生必须得到满足的政策、野心和胃口，而在将来造成更大的问题”。“因此，我们认为，这个问题从一开始就应当以最明确的方式加以对待。”
    腊斯克重申美国的“和谈”骗局，他说，“如果他们愿意坐到会议桌旁，用和平的方式来争论分歧，那末我们将会在那里，但是我们不能接受河内，或者河内北平联合起来，或者任何其他人联合起来……把它们的意志用武力强加于它们的邻居。”
    当有记者问腊斯克，他是否认为能够在苏联政府的帮助下制定出越南战争的某种解决办法时，他回答说，“五年来，美国已经尽了各种努力来这样做。”他说，“的确，我们随时准备，而且事实上已经并且正在同莫斯科密切接触，以探求是否能作任何有用的事情以便把东南亚的这些问题从战场移向会议桌。”他强调苏联“对维护世界和平有某种责任”。
    腊斯克表示“十分欣赏”英国工党政府在美国侵越战争中给予的“政治上的支持”，但是他抱怨“盟国”所提供的实际援助“比我们所希望的少”。他对北大西洋集团“盟国”大施压力，要它们“不要低估我们（美国）在太平洋那边打仗而同时要维持我们在西欧的全部义务所面临的问题”，“我们希望在这些问题上得到尽可能多的帮助，我们也希望北大西洋公约组织中每个成员照管他们自己在北大西洋公约组织中的义务，做他们自己的国防预算中所应做的事，尽可能多地挑起北大西洋公约组织的担子”。腊斯克还要求“盟国”考虑向南越派人的问题。但是，有记者向他指出，盟国并不认为越南战争涉及它们的切身利益。
    新华社二十五日讯　《纽约时报》二十四日刊载鲍德温的一篇文章说，美国正积极在泰国修建机场、公路和增加储备，准备增兵泰国，加强侵越战争。
    文章说，现在驻在泰国的美国军人有一万三千多，美国飞机有几百架。美国飞机——F—105、F—4C、F—101等一直在从泰国的五个基地上起飞袭击北越和老挝。文章指出，如果越南战争继续下去，美军人数将增加一倍以上。
    文章说，陆军部队约占美国驻泰国军队人员的三分之一。陆军部队一直保持着足以装备几千名部队的武器、供应品和装备。这些储备中包括数以百计的车辆和坦克，野战炮以及数千吨供应物资。
    文章还指出，美国军队一直在泰国修建公路、机场、油库、油管和其它供应设施。另外还有两家巨大的民用建筑公司已经在泰国梭桃邑海军基地附近开工修建一个大型机场，可供一切类型的飞机起飞和降落。还计划修建另一个大型机场并延长和扩充现有机场的跑道。还计划在梭桃邑附近或许在锡腊恰附近修建一个大型海运终点站，以停泊吃水深的油船和货船。
    文章说，美国还准备修建永久性的美国军事通讯设施等。
