    Drilling Rig "Eyes" - Pressure Indicator
    Workers at the Harbin Thermal Instrument Factory recently produced a much-needed instrument for coal mine drilling rigs—a dual-needle pressure indicator—and have already begun mass production.
    This instrument, referred to as the drilling rig's "eyes," is used to monitor and adjust the pressure of the drilling tools at the bottom of the well, something China was previously unable to manufacture.
    The Harbin Thermal Instrument Factory is a small factory with incomplete equipment, and they encountered many difficulties in trial-manufacturing this instrument. However, under the leadership of the factory's Party branch, the workers relied on collective wisdom and overcame one difficulty after another. When they lacked a pipe crimping machine, they manufactured a simple crimping die as a substitute; when they lacked a die-casting machine, they modified the design by changing the pressure-bearing components to drawn copper material and welding; when they lacked drawings and technical data, they conducted repeated explorations and experiments, and finally drew the drawings and calculated the data. In this way, they used tools such as files, drills, and saws to make more than a hundred parts and assembled them into an instrument sample. Subsequently, they conducted multiple tests and improvements, and finally successfully created the dual-needle pressure indicator. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 钻机“眼睛”——压力指示器

    钻机“眼睛”——压力指示器
    哈尔滨热工仪表厂职工最近制成一种煤矿钻机上急需的仪表——双针式压力指示器，并且已经开始成批生产。
    这种被称作钻机“眼睛”的仪表，是供掌握和调整井底钻具压力用的，过去我国不能制造。
    哈尔滨热工仪表厂是个小厂，设备不全，试制这种仪表遇到很多困难。但是，职工们在工厂党支部的领导下，依靠集体智慧，战胜了一个又一个的困难。没有压管机，他们就制造了一个简易围管胎代替；没有压铸机，他们就从设计上把受压部件改为拉制铜料焊接；没有图纸和技术数据，他们就进行反复探索试验，最后绘出了图纸，测算出了数据。就这样，他们用锉、钻、锯等工具，做出了一百多个部件，装成了仪表样品。随后，他们又进行了多次试验和改进，终于成功地造出了双针式压力指示器。　　（据新华社讯）
