    A Good Student of Workers, A Good Teacher of Students
    Because we are willing to put down our airs and be elementary school students, the workers like us more and more, and the relationship between master and apprentice is also getting closer and closer.
    In the second semester of 1964, our Philosophy Department implemented a half-work, half-study educational system for the first and second grades. I participated in half-work, half-study with my classmates. Through practice, I deeply realized that a teacher in a half-work, half-study school can only be a good teacher to students by being a good student in front of the workers.
    Last February, sixty-six students and nine teachers came to the Changchun Meteorological Instrument Factory. For many years, intellectuals who had been detached from labor and looked down on working people were going to take workers as their teachers, which caused a lot of discussion among the workers. Some workers directly asked us, "You are philosophy students, what is the use of learning to be locksmiths?" An old师傅 (shīfu, master) even said to me with a smile, "It's not good for you to always stay in school. Coming out to run around a bit every week will allow you to eat more and be good for your health."…
    The workers suspected that we apprentices were not sincere, so it was difficult to develop a master-apprentice relationship. I deeply realized that if the master-apprentice relationship issue was not resolved first, it would be even more difficult to carry out half-work, half-study in the future.
    I promptly reported the situation to the organization and, with this question in mind, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's writings, understanding that the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants requires a process of mutual familiarization. We cannot be impatient, we must first find out the reasons and see if the workers really do not welcome us.
    One day, I went to the factory alone with these questions. It was very cold that day, and my mask was frozen solid, so the workers were particularly surprised by my arrival. Lao Ping 师傅, who had never spoken to me before, asked, "Haven't you completed your weekly labor tasks? Why are you here again?" I said that I was not very busy at home, so I came to do some work. When the workers heard that I had come specifically to work today, they took the initiative to find work for me. While learning the technique of making locks from Lao Ping 师傅, I chatted with him. The master became even happier and chatted even more enthusiastically.
    After returning, I made a serious analysis of these situations, and the Party organization also helped me to improve my understanding, making me understand that as long as we resolutely take the road of half-work, half-study, work steadfastly, and humbly learn from the workers, they will definitely welcome us and like us. The students agreed with this analysis, so everyone jointly decided to start with labor, truly put down our airs, and use practical actions to convince the workers that we are sincerely here to take them as our teachers. In this way, when we went to work again, we were a bit like apprentices, willingly working hard, taking the initiative to find work to do, warming up meals for the 师傅s in the morning, and cleaning up tools, wiping workbenches, sweeping the floor, and cleaning toilets after work, doing all kinds of odd jobs. Once we had the opportunity to work, even if it was the simplest job, we strictly followed the 师傅s' requirements, emphasizing quality first, and doing each one well.
    In this way, because we were willing to put down our airs, truly look like apprentices, look like we were taking the working class as our teachers, and willing to be elementary school students, the workers liked us more and more, and the master-apprentice relationship became closer and closer, and the 师傅s' demands on us became stricter and stricter. Once, I examined my own fame and profit-seeking thoughts at a meeting. When I was working, the 师傅 criticized me earnestly, "You shouldn't be like this! In the old society, could someone like you become a university teacher? In your dreams!" This gave me a deeper education.
    The teacher does a little, and the students do a lot. The students worked even better than me, and the master-apprentice relationship was even closer than mine. When student Li Chunyuan heard that his 师傅 had forgotten to bring his lunch, he took the initiative to bring two馒头s (mántou, steamed buns) back for his 师傅 during lunch. He also established a "one-help-one, one-pair-red" relationship with his 师傅.
    "To be a good teacher, you must first be a good student." I don't know how many times I have read and talked about Chairman Mao's famous saying in the past, but only after half-work, half-study and "four togethers" (eat together, live together, work together, study together) with the students, did I truly understand some of it. Originally, a teacher in a half-work, half-study program, as long as you strive to be a good student in front of the workers, you are a good teacher in front of the students. If in the past it was enough to teach well to be successful in everything, it is impossible to survive that way now. To be a teacher in a half-work, half-study program, you must not only teach well, but also take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in participating in labor, take the lead in being a good student of the workers, and take the lead in ideological transformation. Therefore, being a teacher in a half-work, half-study program, being a little more hardworking will not break you, skipping a meal will not starve you, sleeping a little less will not tire you, but if you fail to take the lead for a moment, I don't know how many detours dozens of students will take, and I don't know how much damage will be caused to the Party's work.

### 作工人的好学生  作学生的好先生

    作工人的好学生  作学生的好先生
    由于我们肯放下架子，甘当小学生，工人也就越来越喜欢我们，师徒关系也越来越密切。
    一九六四年下学期，我们哲学系一、二年级试行了半工半读教育制度。我和同学一起参加了半工半读。通过实践，我深深体会到：一个半工半读学校的教师，只有在工人面前做好学生，才能在学生面前做好先生。
    去年二月，六十六名学生和九位老师，来到了长春气象仪器厂。多少年来，脱离劳动、轻视劳动人民的知识分子要拜工人为师，这在工人中议论很多。有的工人直接问我们：“你们是哲学系学生，学钳工有什么用？”有一位老师傅还笑呵呵地对我说：“你们总关在学校也不好，每个礼拜都出来跑搭跑搭，还能多吃点饭，对身体有好处。”……
    工人怀疑我们这些徒弟心不诚，所以师徒关系就很难搞。我深深地意识到，如果不首先解决师徒关系问题，以后的半工半读就更难办了。
    我及时向组织上汇报了情况，并且带着这个问题认真学习了毛主席著作，懂得了知识分子与工农群众相结合，要有一段相互熟悉的过程，不能着急，先得摸清原因，看看工人是不是真的不欢迎我们。
    有一天，我就带着这些问题，一个人到工厂去了。这一天很冷，口罩都冻成了硬块，所以工人对于我的到来格外惊讶，一次没跟我说过话的老平师傅问我：“你每周的劳动任务不是都完成了吗，怎么又来了？”我说家里不太忙，就来干点活。工人们一听今天我是专门来劳动的，就主动给我找活干。我一面向老平师傅学习做锁头的技术，一面和他唠喀，老师傅越发高兴，唠得就更加热呼了。
    回来后，我对这些情况作了认真分析，党组织也帮助我提高认识，使我懂得只要我们坚决走半工半读的路，踏踏实实地劳动，虚心向工人学习，他们就一定会欢迎我们，喜欢我们。同学们很同意这个分析，于是大家就共同商定，从劳动入手，真正放下架子，用实际行动让工人相信，我们是诚心实意来拜他们为师的。这样，再上班的时候，我们就有点学徒工的样子了，甘心打下脚，自己主动找活干，早晨上班的时候给师傅们去热饭，下班的时候，整理工具、擦工作台、扫地和擦厕所等等，什么杂事都干。一旦有了干活的机会，哪怕是最简单的活，我们也严格遵照师傅的要求，强调质量第一，干一个是一个。
    就是这样，由于我们肯放下架子，真正象个学徒工的样子，象个拜工人阶级为师，甘当小学生的样子，所以，工人也就越来越喜欢我们，师徒关系也越来越密切，而且师傅对我们的要求也越来越严格了。有一次，我在会上检查了自己的名利思想，干活的时候，师傅就语重心长地批评我：“你这可不应当啊！在旧社会，象你这样的人还能当上大学老师？做梦吧！”这使我受到了更深刻的教育。
    老师作一点，学生作一片。同学们的劳动比我更好，师徒关系也比我更密切。李春源同学听说师傅忘了带饭，吃午饭的时候，就主动给师傅捎两个馒头回来。他还和师傅搞成了“一帮一，一对红”。
    “要作好先生，首先要作好学生。”毛主席的这句名言，过去不知读了多少遍，讲了多少遍，可是，只有在半工半读和学生四同（同吃、同住、同工、同读）以后，我才算真正地明白了一些。原来，一个半工半读的教师，只要你在工人面前努力做好学生，在学生们面前你就是好先生。如果说过去只要能把课讲好，就可以事事如意，那么现在就无论如何也过不下去了。当一个半工半读教师，不仅要讲好课，还得带头学好毛主席著作，带头参加劳动，带头做工人的好学生，带头进行思想改造。所以，做一个半工半读教师，多辛苦一点累不坏，少吃一顿饭饿不坏，少睡一点也困不坏，可是一时带头不到，就不知几十名学生要走多少弯路，就不知要给党的工作造成多大损失。
