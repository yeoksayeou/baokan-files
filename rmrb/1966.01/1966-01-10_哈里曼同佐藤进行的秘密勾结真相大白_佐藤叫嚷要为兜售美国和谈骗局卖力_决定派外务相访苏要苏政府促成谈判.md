    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 9th: The Sato government has openly expressed its willingness to serve the US's "peace talk" deception.
    According to Kyodo News, Eisaku Sato held talks with US President's special envoy Averell Harriman on the 7th. Sato stated: "Japan will also make every effort within its power to get the communist side to accept US peace negotiations." To assist US peace activities, Sato decided to send Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina to visit the Soviet Union starting on the 15th. According to Kyodo News, Japan will use Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union to "work to persuade the Soviet Union to convince North Vietnam to agree to hold negotiations."
    After Sato's meeting with Harriman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Tomisaburo Hashimoto announced at a press conference that this "was an important meeting, but it has been agreed with the United States that detailed content cannot be disclosed."
    During his stay in Tokyo, Harriman also held talks with representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan. In his speeches during the talks, he made it clear that despite the US's smokescreen of "peace talks," it is determined to stay in South Vietnam. According to Kyodo News, Harriman said, "Even if things continue as they are now, the United States will not withdraw from Vietnam." Harriman also said, "If guerrilla warfare can win in Vietnam, then its influence will spread to seven countries in Latin America, where it will not be difficult for the same phenomenon to occur. This is absolutely incompatible with the national interests of the United States."
    Harriman arrived in Japan on the evening of the 6th during his tour to peddle the US's "peace talk" deception, and he has already left for Australia on the 9th.

    哈里曼同佐藤进行的秘密勾结真相大白
    佐藤叫嚷要为兜售美国和谈骗局卖力  决定派外务相访苏要苏政府促成谈判
    据新华社九日讯　东京消息：佐藤政府公然表示愿为美国的“和谈”骗局效劳。
    据共同社报道，佐藤荣作七日同美国总统的特使哈里曼举行了会谈。佐藤表示：“日本也要为使共产党方面接受美国的和平谈判而作出力所能及的努力。”为了协助美国的和平活动，佐藤决定派外务相椎名悦三郎在十五日启程访问苏联。据共同社透露，日本将利用外务大臣椎名悦三郎访问苏联时，“进行工作，促使苏联说服北越同意举行谈判”。
    在佐藤同哈里曼会谈以后，日本内阁官房长官桥本登美三郎在记者招待会上宣布，这“是一次重要的会谈，不过已经同美国方面商量好，不能奉告详细内容”。
    哈里曼在逗留东京期间，还同日本自由民主党、社会党和民主社会党的代表进行会谈。他在会谈中发表的讲话表明，美国尽管大放“和谈”烟幕，但是决心赖在南越不走。据共同社报道，哈里曼说：“就是照目前这种状态继续下去，美国也不从越南撤退”。哈里曼还说，“如果游击战能够在越南赢得胜利，那末，它的影响就将波及拉丁美洲七个国家，在那里也不难发生同样的现象。这种事情是同美国的国家利益绝对不相容的”。
    哈里曼是在兜售美国的“和谈”骗局的旅行中，于六日晚间到达日本的，他已在九日前往澳大利亚。
