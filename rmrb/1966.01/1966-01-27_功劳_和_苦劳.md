    “Merit” and “Hard Work”
    Yao Renwei
    I once heard several comrades working in leadership positions in the county say: "From morning till night, from spring to winter, we are busy all the time. Even if we haven't achieved 'merit,' we have put in 'hard work.' Regardless of what kind of 'work' it is, we are sweating for the people!" Of course, this "hard work" of sweating for the people should be respected by everyone. However, should we only see that we have contributed some "hard work" and then become complacent and self-satisfied? We cannot and should not.
    Where does the truth lie? First, we are a team working thoroughly for the interests of the people. If we are satisfied with our "hard work," it will be difficult to meet the requirements of thoroughness. Second, we are dialectical materialists, believers in the unity of motive and effect. Since our work should have the motive of everything for the people, we should strive for an effect that is welcomed by the people and beneficial to them. Third, we are engaged in revolutionary work, which by definition means breaking the old and creating the new. The old working methods of following the "four seasons" and busily urging plowing, sowing, harvesting, and purchasing are very unsuitable for today's requirements of realizing the revolutionization of leadership.
    We should see that there is "work" where good people do foolish things, "work" where one works hard but achieves little or even nothing, and "work" where the method is correct and the result is achieved with half the effort. The methods of "work" are different, and the results of "work" are also different. As revolutionary cadres responsible to the Party and the people, how can we not care about what kind of "work" it is?
    "One point of plowing, one point of harvest." If we put in one point of "hard work," we must create one point of "merit" for the people. We do not approve of the blind, futile labor of "only knowing how to plow but not asking about the harvest," nor should we be satisfied with "hard work" without "merit." "Merit" and "hard work" can be proportional if handled well. The key is to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit in practical work, improve consciousness, and reduce blindness. In this way, however much "hard work" you put in for the people, you will also have that much "merit."

    “功劳”和“苦劳”
    姚人为
    曾经听到几个在县里担任领导工作的同志这样说：“一天到晚，从春到冬，忙来忙去，没立下‘功劳’，也有份‘苦劳’。不管什么‘劳’，都是为人民流汗吧！”当然，为人民流汗这份“苦劳”，应该受到大家尊重。然而，我们应不应当只看到自己献出了点“苦劳”，就此自满自足起来？不能而且也不应该。
    道理在哪里？第一，我们是彻底为人民利益而工作的队伍。如果满足于自己的“苦劳”，那就很难达到彻底的要求；第二，我们是辩证唯物主义者，是动机和效果的统一论者，既然做工作要有一切为了人民的动机，就要力求有被人民欢迎、对人民有益的效果；第三，我们干的是革命工作，顾名思义，就要破旧创新。那种跟着“四大季”转，辛辛苦苦忙于催耕、催种、催收、催购的老一套工作方法，是很不适应今天实现领导革命化的要求的。
    我们应当看到：有好人做了蠢事的“劳”，有辛辛苦苦成绩不大甚至一事无成的“劳”，有方法对头、事半功倍的“劳”。“劳”的方法不一样，“劳”的结果也就不一样。作为对党对人民负责的革命干部，怎么可以不管什么“劳”呢？
    “一分耕耘，一分收获”。我们付出一分“苦劳”，就一定得为人民创立一分“功劳”。我们不赞成那种“只知耕耘，不问收获”的盲目徒劳，也不应满足于没有“功劳”的“苦劳”。“功劳”和“苦劳”处理得好，是可以成正比例的。关键就是在实际工作中，把革命热情和科学精神结合起来，提高自觉性，减少盲目性。这样，你为人民尽了多少“苦劳”，也就会有多少“功劳”。
