    In a large house in a fishing village on the Bohai Sea, the Third Artillery Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a solemn military meeting. Political Instructor Zheng Jun held a box of raisins in his hands and said excitedly:
  “Today’s military meeting is for these raisins, which are full of profound friendship.” Then, he told everyone the origin of the raisins and distributed them.
    Outside the window, the cold wind howled, but inside the house, the stove fire was burning red. At this moment, the hearts of the soldiers were as warm and red as the fire. Each soldier took a golden raisin from the political instructor's hand, as if receiving a radiant pearl, examining it repeatedly. The soldiers were so moved that they couldn't speak.
    Why hold such a solemn meeting just to distribute raisins? Where did the raisins come from? Why were the soldiers so excited to receive a raisin?
    It turned out that the raisins were sent by young people from Tianjin who were participating in the construction of Xinjiang, to the mayor of Tianjin, Hu Zhaoheng, and the vice mayor, Yang Zhengmin, from the remote border of the motherland. Mayor Hu and Vice Mayor Yang then forwarded them to the troops. They also wrote a special letter. The letter read:
      “In recent years, a large number of young people from our city have gone to Xinjiang to participate in construction. A certain unit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, in order to thank our city for its support, sent some raisins—these are the fruits of their labor and the profound feelings of the millions of soldiers and civilians in Xinjiang. We thought it would be most appropriate to send them to the People's Liberation Army comrades who fought the tsunami. Although the things are few, they represent the hearts of the people of Xinjiang and the people of Tianjin."
    The soldiers were unwilling to eat these raisins, which embodied the deep friendship of the people! They said: Protecting the people and fighting the tsunami is the duty of our people's soldiers, and we should not enjoy these precious raisins. The raisins come from the people and should be returned to the people. In the end, all the comrades in the company unanimously decided to transfer this box of raisins to the Tianjin People's Hospital.
    At the same time, military meetings to distribute raisins were being held enthusiastically in other companies that participated in the fight against the tsunami.
    At the military meeting of the Second Artillery Company, a box of raisins was passed from the company commander's hand to the soldiers, from the cook to the driver, to everyone in the company. When the last soldier handed the raisins to the political instructor, a soldier proposed: "During this fight against the tsunami, the Hangu People's Hospital worked day and night to rescue frozen class brothers, and this box of raisins should be sent to the people's doctors who heal the wounded and rescue the dying.” This proposal was immediately met with a burst of warm applause.
    After the raisins were distributed to the Fourth Company, everyone discussed it even more enthusiastically. One soldier said: "I suggest sending it to the heroes of the 'Tiger' speedboat who established meritorious service in the Chongwu sea battle!" "Good!" His words won everyone's warmest approval. A box of raisins, through the post office, was passed to the frontline of coastal defense.
    Some companies, after receiving the raisins, decided to send them to the newly enlisted soldiers, so that from the day they became soldiers, they would receive the deep affection of the people, so that they could better establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.
    Some companies decided to send the raisins to the old soldiers who were about to retire, so that they could bring the people's love and hope, and the spirit of fighting the tsunami, to the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, to the Gobi Desert, to the North China Plain, north and south of the Yangtze River, to all parts of the motherland, spread throughout the country, and promote it...

### 葡萄干到了战海啸的连队后

    葡萄干到了战海啸的连队后
    在渤海某渔村的一个大屋里，中国人民解放军某部炮三连临时召开了一个隆重的军人大会。指导员郑俊双手捧着一盒葡萄干，激动地说：
  “今天的军人大会，就为这情谊深厚的葡萄干。”接着，他把葡萄干的来历给大家讲了一遍，就把它分给大家。
    窗外寒风呼啸，屋里炉火正红。此刻，战士们的心也象炉火一样热，象炉火一样红。每个战士从指导员手里接过一颗金黄色的葡萄干，就象得到一颗光华四射的珍珠，反复地端详着。战士们激动得说不出话来。
    为啥发葡萄干还要举行如此庄严的大会？葡萄干是哪里来的？为啥战士接到一颗葡萄干心情会如此激动？
    原来，葡萄干是天津市参加新疆建设的青年人从祖国遥远的边境送给天津市市长胡昭衡和副市长杨拯民的。胡市长和杨副市长又转送到部队上来。他们还特意写了一封信。信中写道：
      “近几年，我市大批青年去新疆参加建设，新疆建设兵团某部为了答谢我市的支援，送来一些葡萄干——这是他们的劳动果实，是新疆千万军民的深厚心意。我们想，送给战海啸的解放军同志最合适。东西虽少，但这是新疆人民和天津市人民的心意。”
    这些凝聚着人民深情厚谊的葡萄干，战士们那里肯吃！他们说：保护人民、战海啸是我们人民子弟兵的本份，我们不应该享受这些珍贵的葡萄干。葡萄干来自人民，还应当回到人民。最后，全连同志一致决定：把这盒葡萄干转送到天津市人民医院去。
    与此同时，发葡萄干的军人大会也在其它各个参加战海啸的连队热火朝天地开着。
    炮二连军人大会上，一盒葡萄干从连长手里传到战士手里，从炊事员传到驭手，传到了全连的每一个人。当最后一个战士把葡萄干交到指导员手里的时候，一个战士提议说：“在这次战海啸中，汉沽人民医院为抢救冻僵的阶级兄弟，昼夜辛苦，应该把这盒葡萄干送给救死扶伤的人民医生。”这个提议立即得到一阵热烈的掌声。
    葡萄干发到四连以后，大家讨论得更热烈。一个战士说：“我建议送给在崇武海战中建立战功的‘猛虎艇’的英雄们！”“好！”他的话博得了大家最热烈的赞成。一盒葡萄干，通过邮局，又传到了海防前线。
    有的连队在收到葡萄干之后，决定把它送给刚入伍的新战士，让他们从当上战士这天起，就接下人民的深情，使他们更好地树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。
    有的连队则决定把葡萄干送给即将退役的老战士，让他们把人民的爱戴和希望，让战海啸的精神，带到天山脚下，戈壁滩上，带到华北平原、大江南北，带到祖国各地，传遍全国，发扬光大……。
