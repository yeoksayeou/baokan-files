    *Philosophical Research* published a "Special Collection of Philosophical Essays by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers" in its sixth issue of 1965, selecting philosophical essays by twenty comrades, including Xie Yue, Huang Huating, Wang Yuwen, and Li Suwen, allowing us to read the philosophical articles of workers, peasants, and soldiers in a concentrated manner and learn from them better. The *Philosophical Research* editorial department has done a very meaningful work.
    The philosophical essays of workers, peasants, and soldiers are written about philosophy in practical life and are good articles that are rich in content, novel in thought, and lively. They elevate their practical experiences to the philosophical level for analysis. Their experiences and analyses are things that theoretical workers who spend years in their studies reading books have never seen or heard. These articles have rich materials and novel viewpoints; they have both theory and practice; they are both purposeful and well-founded. They are attractive and persuasive to read. Compared to the conceptualized articles that are aimless and whining, they are completely different.
    In the past, some people said that workers, peasants, and soldiers have low cultural levels and cannot study philosophy. This is wrong. Marxist philosophy is a revolutionary, critical, and scientific theory, a philosophy that comes from practice and returns to practice to transform the world. What is theory? Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There is only one kind of true theory in the world, and that is the theory that is drawn from objective reality and proven in objective reality. Nothing else can be called a theory in our sense."
  (《整顿党的作风》"Rectify the Party's Style of Work") In the practice of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively study and apply Mao Zedong's philosophical thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to transform the objective world and also transform their own subjective world, and summarize and generalize their work experience. These philosophical essays of theirs prove that workers, peasants, and soldiers can not only study and use philosophy, but also be much more brilliant than those intellectuals who only know how to mechanically study books.
    In the philosophical essays of workers, peasants, and soldiers selected by *Philosophical Research*, we see that Xie Yue, a young lathe operator in Shanxi with a low level of education, created a new splicing method under the guidance of Mao Zedong's philosophical thought; Huang Huating, a carpenter in Guangdong who had only a few months of schooling, studied and applied Chairman Mao's *On Contradiction* and *On Practice* and made valuable inventions and creations in the technical revolution; Yao Shichang, a farmer in Shandong who had only four years of schooling, studied and applied Mao Zedong's philosophical thought and made creations in the scientific experiment of planting peanuts; Duan Chunzuo, a meteorologist in Hunan who had only one year of junior high school education, learned to "manage the heavens" under the guidance of Chairman Mao's *On Practice* and wrote the popular book *Civilian Weather Forecasting*; Li Ruihuan, a young construction worker and leader of the youth shock brigade of the Beijing Third Construction Company who had not read many books, studied and applied Mao Zedong's philosophical thought, and together with his team members, carried out hundreds of technical innovations, large and small, in a few years, and also wrote a book of 100,000 words entitled *Simple Woodworking Calculation Method*, and so on. They all vividly discussed their work experience in their articles. There are also many articles by PLA soldiers, articles by shop assistants, etc., which are also very good philosophical essays.
    The philosophical essays of workers, peasants, and soldiers are all products of their creative study and application of Mao Zedong's philosophical thought in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements. They are their personal experiences and insights, and they are theoretical generalizations of their work experience in different positions such as operating machines, driving cars, carrying out technical innovations, practicing military skills, farming, doing business, and doing ideological work, using Mao Zedong's philosophical thought. Their philosophical essays are truly "theories drawn from objective reality and proven in objective reality." Their philosophical essays powerfully prove how important it is for workers, peasants, and soldiers to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to improve understanding, transform thinking, promote socialist revolution and construction, and cultivate a new generation of communists.
    Marxist philosophy, if divorced from reality and divorced from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, will become a rigid thing; but once it is combined with reality, it will show its vitality and burst forth with brilliant light. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the direct practitioners in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The essays they write by creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong's philosophical thought in revolutionary practice contain many novel ideas, which are extremely precious mines for our philosophical research work.
    The philosophical essays of workers, peasants, and soldiers are a great driving force for the revolutionization of theoretical workers, especially philosophical workers. The fact that workers, peasants, and soldiers study and use philosophy embodies the great liberation of philosophy and the direction of philosophy going out of the study, out of the classroom, and linking theory with practice. These philosophical essays are not only rich, solid, lively, and combative in content, but also written in the language of the people, with very little academic jargon, making them pleasant and touching to read. In terms of the attitude and method of scholarship, style of study, and writing style, they have all set a vivid example for us. Theoretical workers and philosophical workers must thoroughly get rid of the style of learning from concepts to concepts and from books to books, and to revolutionize themselves, they must go into practice, go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and humbly learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can we transform ourselves into proletarian theoretical workers and philosophical workers, can we explain philosophical principles practically and clearly, and can we transform our philosophy.
    We believe that this issue of *Philosophical Research*'s "Special Collection of Philosophical Essays by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers" is well worth reading carefully.

    认真学习工农兵的哲学论文
    《哲学研究》一九六五年第六期述评
    《哲学研究》一九六五年第六期，发表了“工农兵哲学论文特辑”，选辑了解悦、黄华庭、王玉文、李素文等二十位同志的哲学论文，使我们能够集中地读到工农兵的哲学文章，更好地向他们学习。《哲学研究》编辑部做了一件很有意义的工作。
    工农兵的哲学论文，写的是实际生活中的哲学，是内容丰富、思想新颖、生动活泼的好文章。他们把自己的实践经验，提到哲学上进行分析，他们的经验和他们所作出的分析，是那些常年呆在书斋里啃书本的理论工作者见所未见，闻所未闻的。这些文章既有丰富的材料，又有新颖的观点；既有理论，又有实际；既有的放矢，又论述得有根有据。读起来，吸引人，有说服力。比起那种无的放矢、无病呻吟的概念化的文章来，完全是两种味道。
    过去有人说，工农兵文化低，不能学哲学。这不对。马克思主义的哲学是革命的、批判的、科学的理论，是从实际中来又要回到实际中去改造世界的哲学。什么是理论？毛泽东同志说：“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论，没有任何别的东西可以称得起我们所讲的理论。”
  （《整顿党的作风》）工农兵群众在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的实践中，活学活用毛泽东哲学思想，以毛泽东思想为指导，改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界，对自己的工作经验进行总结和概括。他们的这些哲学论文证明，工农兵不但可以学哲学、用哲学，而且比那些只会死啃书本的知识分子要高明得多。
    在《哲学研究》所选辑的工农兵哲学论文中，我们看到，文化水平不高的青年挡车工、山西的解悦，在毛泽东哲学思想指导下，创造出了一种新的接头法；只读几个月书的木工、广东的黄华庭，学习和运用毛主席的《矛盾论》、《实践论》，在技术革命中做出了有价值的发明创造；只上过四年学的庄稼汉、山东的姚士昌，学习和运用了毛泽东的哲学思想，在种花生的科学实验中有所创造；只读过一年初中的气象员、湖南的段春作，在毛主席的《实践论》的指导下，学会了“管天”，并写出了受读者欢迎的《民间测天法》一书；没有读过多少书的青年建筑工人、北京第三建筑公司青年突击队长李瑞环，学习和运用毛泽东哲学思想，和队员们一起在几年间搞了大小几百件技术革新，还写出了一本十万字的《木工简易计算法》的书，等等。他们都在自己的文章中，生动地论述了自己的工作经验。还有许多解放军战士的文章，商店售货员的文章等，也都是很好的哲学论文。
    工农兵的哲学论文，都是他们在三大革命运动的实践中，活学活用毛泽东哲学思想的产物，是他们亲身经历的心得体会，是他们在开机器、驾驶汽车、搞技术革新、练兵打仗、种庄稼、做生意、做人的思想工作等不同岗位上，运用毛泽东哲学思想对自己的工作经验所做的理论概括。他们的哲学论文真正是“从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论。”他们的哲学论文，有力地证明，工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，对于提高认识、改造思想，推动社会主义革命和建设，对于培养一代共产主义的新人，具有多么重大的意义。
    马克思主义哲学如果脱离了实际，脱离了工农兵，就会变成僵死的东西；而一旦和实际结合，就会显示出它的生命力，迸发出鲜艳的光辉。广大工农兵群众是阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中的直接的实践者。他们在革命实践中活学活用毛泽东哲学思想所写出来的论文，包含着许多新颖的思想，这是我们哲学研究工作的极其珍贵的矿藏。
    工农兵的哲学论文，对于理论工作者特别是哲学工作者的革命化，是一个很大的推动力。工农兵学哲学、用哲学，体现了哲学的大解放，体现了哲学走出书斋、走出课堂、理论联系实际的方向。这些哲学论文，不仅内容丰富踏实、生动活泼、战斗性强，而且是用人民的语言写的，很少学生腔，读起来亲切感人。在治学的态度和方法、学风和文风方面，它们都给我们做出了活生生的榜样。理论工作者、哲学工作者，要彻底摆脱从概念到概念、从书本到书本的学风，使自己革命化，就必须到实际中去，到工农兵群众中去，与工农兵相结合，虚心地向工农兵学习。只有这样，才能把自己改造成为一个无产阶级的理论工作者、哲学工作者，才能把哲学道理讲得实际、写得清楚，才能使我们的哲学得到改造。
    我们认为，这一期《哲学研究》的
  “工农兵哲学论文特辑”，很值得大家认真地读一读。
