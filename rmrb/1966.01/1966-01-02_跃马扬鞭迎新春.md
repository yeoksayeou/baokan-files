    Whips Cracking, Horses Leaping, Welcoming the New Spring
    First Tractor Factory Worker Dong Zhenguo

    Sleeves buttoned tight, waistband cinched, I didn't wait for the whistle's call, rushing headlong towards the workshop!  Clutching the crank handle, I heard the Secretary's words ringing in my ears:
  "To prepare warhorses for the Third Five-Year Plan, we must overcome difficulties and win victory!" My heart thumped!  My energy is like a river, surging forth, what do we care how big the difficulties are!  Look! The engine roars a battle song, iron filings fly like colorful clouds, purple smoke rises from the tip of the cutting tool, silver rivers surge underfoot.  The more I work, the more energetic I become! That hundred-plus-jin steel shaft, feels like a sesame seed in my hand; that large and difficult technical hurdle, I overcome it in three or two cuts. Golden flower sprinkles scattered across the sky, much like our passion bursting forth. The victory drums beat loudly, laughter echoes everywhere; gazing at the motherland amidst the cheers: Motherland ah – you are draped in red and colorful decorations, welcoming the Third Five-Year Plan!

    跃马扬鞭迎新春
    第一拖拉机厂工人　董振国双袖扣牢，裤腰紧扎，不等汽笛声声催，急匆匆朝车间飞跨！紧握车摇把，耳旁响起书记的话：
  “为给第三个五年计划备战马，咱们要战胜困难，赢得胜利！”咱的心儿直蹦哒；浑身劲儿象河水，滚滚出了闸，困难再大算个啥！看！马达隆隆唱战歌，铁屑刷刷飞彩霞，车刀尖上紫烟冒，脚下银河翻浪花。我呀，越干劲越大！还是百十斤重的大钢轴，掂在手里象芝麻；还是大而难的技术关，我三刀两刀就攻下。黄灿灿金花漫天撒，多象咱的激情在迸发。报捷锣鼓咚咚敲，欢声笑语四处洒；欢腾声中望祖国：祖国呀——正披红挂彩迎接第三个五年计划！
