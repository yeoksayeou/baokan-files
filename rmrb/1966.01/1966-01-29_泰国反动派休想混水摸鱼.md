    Thai Reactionaries Should Stop Trying to Fish in Troubled Waters
    By Our Correspondent
    Recently, Thai troops have repeatedly shelled the defensive installations of the Chine Sa area in Koh Kong Province, Cambodia, from their Hale outpost, infringing upon the sacred territory of Cambodia. This is a blatant act of armed provocation. However, the Thanom government has counter-accused Cambodian soldiers of firing on the Thai village of Hale first. This despicable trick of crying "stop thief!" is not enough to cover up the crimes of aggression perpetrated by the Thai reactionaries.
    Everyone knows that the Thai reactionary authorities have recently been carrying out repeated military provocations against Cambodia. Thai troops have been constantly violating the Cambodian border, and they have become increasingly rampant. On January 5 this year, Thai Prime Minister Thanom even publicly clamored at a cabinet meeting that Thailand would launch a "powerful" offensive against Cambodia from the land, sea, and air. The aggressive arrogance of the Thai reactionaries is extremely blatant. The Bangkok authorities are so reckless entirely because they are emboldened by their master, the United States. The Thanom government is acting according to the orders of U.S. imperialism. In order to salvage its defeat on the South Vietnam battlefield, the Johnson administration is preparing to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina. It not only uses Thailand as an outpost for implementing this adventurous plan, but also uses the Thai reactionaries as its pawns. However, the Thanom government is wholeheartedly acting as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in expanding its war of aggression.
    The Thai reactionaries' attempt to fish in troubled waters with U.S. imperialism is a sign that they are completely ignorant of the times. U.S. imperialism is already in a desperate situation in South Vietnam. If it expands the war to the entire Indochina, it will suffer even more disastrous defeat. The Thai reactionaries can only play the role of accompanying the U.S. aggressors to their graves. The Cambodian people are not to be trifled with. Prince Sihanouk has stated more than once that the Cambodian people are prepared for the invasion of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and will fight back against all enemy offensives. Moreover, the Cambodian people have already shown their determination to resolutely defend their independence and sovereignty with concrete actions. At a press conference on the 26th, Cambodian Secretary of State for Information, Chea Sang, once again solemnly declared: "We will never give up an inch of our land. This is the firm policy of our government towards Thailand and South Vietnam (puppet regime)." The Thanom government's attempt to follow its U.S. master in an adventure against Cambodia is bound to backfire.

    泰国反动派休想混水摸鱼
    本报评论员
    最近，泰国军队从它的哈勒哨所，一再炮轰柬埔寨戈公省奇内萨地方的防御设施，侵犯柬埔寨的神圣领土。这是一种明目张胆的武装挑衅行为。而他侬政府竟然反诬柬埔寨士兵先向泰国的哈勒村开火。泰国反动派这种贼喊捉贼的卑鄙伎俩，是掩盖不住它的侵略罪行的。
    谁都知道，泰国反动当局最近以来，一再对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅。泰国军队不断侵犯柬埔寨边境，而且越来越猖狂。今年一月五日，泰国总理他侬在内阁会议上甚至公开叫嚷，泰国将从陆、海、空三方面对柬埔寨发动“强有力的”进攻。泰国反动派的侵略气焰是十分嚣张的。曼谷当局之所以如此胆大妄为，完全是狐假虎威，它的背后有美国主子在撑腰。他侬政府是按照美帝国主义的号令行事的。约翰逊政府为了挽救它在南越战场上的败局，正在准备把侵略战火扩大到整个印度支那。它不仅把泰国作为执行这个冒险计划的前哨阵地，而且把泰国反动派作为它的走卒。而他侬政府却死心塌地充当美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的帮凶。
    泰国反动派想跟着美帝国主义混水摸鱼，是太不识时务了。美帝国主义在南越已经弄得焦头烂额，它要把战争扩大到整个印度支那，必将遭到更加惨重的失败。泰国反动派扮演的只能是给美国侵略者陪葬的角色。柬埔寨人民并不是好欺负的。西哈努克亲王不止一次明白表示，柬埔寨人民对美帝国主义及其仆从的入侵已经作好了准备，将回击敌人的一切进攻。而且柬埔寨人民已经用实际行动显示他们坚决捍卫独立和主权的决心。柬埔寨新闻国务秘书谢桑二十六日在记者招待会上再一次郑重宣布：“我们决不放弃我们的一寸土地。这是我国政府现在对泰国和南越（傀儡政权）的坚定政策。”他侬政府企图追随美国主子对柬埔寨进行冒险，必然是自讨苦吃。
