    (Comprehensive report by our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: Vietnamese and world public opinion continues to unanimously and strongly condemn the barbarous atrocities of the American aggressors in South Vietnam, exposing the Johnson administration's "peace talk" fraud.
    A joint statement issued on the 12th by the Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnamese Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee emphasized that the Vietnamese people have long seen through the bellicose and aggressive nature of American imperialism and therefore harbor no illusions about its so-called "peaceful sincerity." The Vietnamese people know that to have genuine peace, they must resolutely resist and defeat American imperialism's aggression. The Vietnamese people have done so and will continue to do so.
    The statement said that the Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnamese Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee strongly accuse world opinion of the malicious conspiracies and barbarous crimes of American imperialism, and express their complete agreement with the January 4th statement by the Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the January 5th statement by the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.
    The Permanent Bureau of the International Conference for Solidarity with the Vietnamese People Against American Imperialist Aggression and Defense of Peace issued a statement on the 13th, saying that while American imperialism is vigorously promoting "peace efforts," it is intensifying the war of aggression in South Vietnam and stepping up the implementation of a large-scale "scorched earth plan" in South Vietnam, attempting to implement a "kill all, burn all, destroy all" policy in every region. At the same time, American aircraft are continuing to prepare for "gradual escalation" against North Vietnam and are plotting to expand the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula.
    The statement expressed full support for the statement of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front exposing the American conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, and called on the people of all countries, the American people, and all peace-loving organizations and individuals in the world to severely condemn American imperialism and stop its bloody claws.
    The Korean *Rodong Sinmun* published a commentary on the 14th, saying that while American imperialism has recently been engaging in a "peace offensive," it has intensified the "kill all, burn all, destroy all" policy in South Vietnam, exposing the true intentions of the American aggressors' loudly proclaimed "peace efforts," which has aroused great anger among the good people of the world.
    The *Akahata*, the organ of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in its Sunday edition (issue of the 16th), which was published in advance, pointing out that the U.S. government's "Fourteen Points" proposal is subject to two preconditions. First, as long as the South Vietnamese people do not give up their just liberation struggle, the U.S. military will absolutely not withdraw. Second, the United States maintains the South Vietnamese puppet regime it created. This is truly the face of a shameless robber.
    The article pointed out that American imperialism attempts to "legitimize" its crimes of expanding aggression with the "Fourteen Points" proposal, while at the same time accusing the Vietnamese people of refusing to "negotiate."
    Pathet Lao Radio issued a commentary pointing out that the words and deeds of American imperialism, especially its playing with the trick of "suspending bombing," are shameless robber-like words and deeds.
    "Voice of Laos" Radio also published a commentary saying that American imperialism is the aggressor, and the people of South Vietnam are forced to rise up and fight back to defend their homeland. How can the Vietnamese people accept "peace talks" that allow it to continue to stay in South Vietnam?

### 约翰逊大骗局十目所视  美帝野蛮兽行千夫所指  越南和世界舆论斥责美帝“和平攻势”和“三光”政策

    约翰逊大骗局十目所视  美帝野蛮兽行千夫所指
    越南和世界舆论斥责美帝“和平攻势”和“三光”政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：越南和世界公众舆论继续一致强烈谴责美国侵略者在南越的野蛮暴行，揭露约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会十二日联合发表声明强调说，越南人民早就看穿了美帝国主义的好战和侵略本质，因此对它的所谓“和平诚意”不抱任何幻想。越南人民知道，要有真正的和平，就必须坚决地抗击和挫败美帝国主义的侵略。越南人民已经这样做，并将继续这样做。
    声明说，越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会向世界舆论强烈控诉美帝国主义的恶毒阴谋和野蛮罪行，并且表示完全赞同越南民主共和国外交部发言人一月四日的声明和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一月五日的声明。
    声援越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平国际会议常设局十三日发表声明说，美帝国主义在大肆宣扬“和平努力”的同时，正在强化在越南南方的侵略战争，加紧在越南南方推行大规模的“焦土计划”，企图对每个地区实行“杀光、烧光、毁光”的政策。同时，美国飞机继续对越南北方进行的“逐步升级”作准备，并阴谋把战争扩大到整个印度支那半岛。
    声明表示完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会关于揭露美国扩大侵越战争阴谋的声明，并呼吁世界各国人民，美国人民和世界爱好和平的一切组织和人士，严厉谴责美帝国主义，制止它的血腥魔掌。
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》十四日发表评论说，美帝国主义最近在大搞“和平攻势”的同时，在越南南方加紧推行“杀光、烧光、毁光”政策，暴露出美国侵略者口口声声叫嚷的“和平努力”的真正用意，激起了全世界善良人民的极大愤怒。
    提前出版的日共中央机关报《赤旗报》星期日版（十六日一期）发表文章指出，美国政府的“十四点”主张是附有两个先决条件的。第一，只要南越人民不放弃正义的解放斗争，美军就绝对不撤走。第二，美国保住它制造出来的南越傀儡政权。这真是无耻的强盗嘴脸。
    文章指出，美帝国主义企图用“十四点”主张来使它扩大侵略的罪行“正当化”，同时，给越南人民加上拒绝“谈判”的罪名。
    巴特寮电台发表评论指出，美帝国主义的言行，尤其是它玩弄“暂停轰炸”的花招，是恬不知耻的强盗言行。
    “老挝之声”电台也发表评论说，美帝国主义是侵略者，越南南方人民被迫奋起还击，以保卫国土。越南人民怎能会接受让它继续赖在越南南方的“和平谈判”？
