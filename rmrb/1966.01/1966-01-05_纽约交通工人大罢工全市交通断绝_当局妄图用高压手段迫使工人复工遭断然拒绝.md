    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 4th: The strike by more than 35,000 subway and bus workers in New York City, which began on New Year's Day, has entered its fourth day. The entire city of New York has been paralyzed due to the disruption of public transportation.

    This is an unprecedented strike by public transportation workers in New York City.

    Western news agencies, in reporting the impact of the New York City public transportation workers' strike, said that it is estimated that about 2.5 million people in the city were unable to go to work and engage in other activities on the 3rd due to the lack of transportation. Many agencies, factories, and stores had to close. The report also said that the sudden increase in pedestrians, coupled with many private cars and taxis, almost completely blocked the streets during the pre-work hours. On some bridges leading to the downtown area, the crowded people could only "move slowly like ants."

    The New York State judicial authorities are attempting to use high-pressure tactics to force the workers to return to work. On the evening of the 3rd, the New York State Supreme Court ordered nine strike leaders, including Michael Quill, to end the strike by 11:00 AM on the 4th, otherwise they would be imprisoned for "contempt of court." Prior to this, the New York State Supreme Court had also ordered strike leader Quill to appear in court for trial on the 3rd, but Quill resolutely refused. Quill emphasized: "Many of us may go to jail. But... our second line will take over, and if necessary, there will be a third line, a fourth line."

    纽约交通工人大罢工全市交通断绝
    当局妄图用高压手段迫使工人复工遭断然拒绝
    新华社四日讯纽约消息：纽约市地下铁道和公共汽车工人三万五千多名，从元旦开始的大罢工，已经进入第四天。整个纽约市，由于公共交通断绝而陷入瘫痪状态。
    这是纽约市公共交通工人举行的空前规模的罢工。
    西方通讯社在报道因纽约市公共交通工人罢工所受到的影响时说，估计，在三日这天，全市约有二百五十万人因为缺乏交通工具而无法上班和从事其他活动。许多机关、工厂和商店不得不关门。消息还说，陡然增多的徒步行人加上许多私人汽车和出租汽车，在上班前的一段时间里几乎把街道完全阻塞。在通往市中心区的一些大桥上，拥挤的人群只能“象蚂蚁一样缓慢地移动”。
    纽约州司法当局妄图用高压手段迫使工人复工。三日晚，纽约州最高法院勒令迈克尔·奎尔等九名罢工领导人在四日上午十一时前结束罢工，否则将以“藐视法庭”罪名把他们投入监狱。在这以前，纽约州最高法院还曾命令罢工领导人奎尔于三日出庭受审，但遭到了奎尔的断然拒绝。奎尔强调说：“我们许多人可能会进监狱。但是……我们的第二线将接替我们，而且必要的话，还有第三线、第四线。”
