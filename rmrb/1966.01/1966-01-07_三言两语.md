    A Few Words
    The White House published a so-called document, "The Heart of the Vietnam Problem," which put forward a "Fourteen-Point Plan" for a "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnam problem. It concluded with the line: "We have put everything into the peace basket, except for surrendering South Vietnam."

    This concluding sentence is truly the finishing touch. Johnson's "peace basket" certainly contains a lot of things, but it lacks one: the United States getting out of South Vietnam. In other words, Johnson has proposed thousands of things, all for one purpose: the United States clinging to South Vietnam and refusing to leave.

    The American *Washington Star* published a New Year's Eve commentary last year, discussing the situation of the United States. It pointed out that Johnson suffered "terrible setbacks" in 1965, and that "even a cautious and careful look at the New Year is discouraging. The road ahead seems full of depressing setbacks."

    The past year was one of "terrible setbacks"; the New Year will be one of "depressing setbacks." Setback follows setback, making it unbearable to look back and equally unbearable to look ahead. This is a true reflection of the Johnson administration, which is mired in internal and external difficulties.

    The United States Representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, peddled "peace" panaceas at a press conference, advocating the realization of "decent peace" in Vietnam.

    American imperialism is waging a most indecent war of aggression in Vietnam, and the more it fights, the more indecent it becomes. For American imperialism, the most decent way is to get out of Vietnam as soon as possible. The Johnson administration's attempt to achieve a "decent peace" that allows American aggressors to permanently occupy South Vietnam is impossible and will only result in losing all face.

    三言两语
    白宫发表的所谓《越南问题的中心》的文件，提出“和平解决”越南问题的“十四点计划”，最后写道：“除了拱让南越之外，我们已经把所有东西放进了和平篮子”。
    这一句结束语真是画龙点睛。约翰逊的“和平篮子”里的确放了不少东西，就缺少一样，那就是美国滚出南越。换句话说，约翰逊提出了千条万条，都无非是为了一条：美国死赖在南越不走。

    美国《华盛顿明星晚报》去年除夕发表一篇送旧迎新的评论，谈到美国的处境。它指出，约翰逊在一九六五年遭到“可怕的挫折”，而他“甚至小心谨慎地展望一下新年也是令人泄气的。前面的道路上似乎充满了令人忧郁的挫折”。
    过去的一年，是“可怕的挫折”；新的一年，是“令人忧郁的挫折”。挫折接连着挫折，既不堪回首，也不堪前瞻。这正是对陷于内外交困之中的约翰逊政府的真实写照。

    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡在记者招待会上大肆贩卖“和平”假药，鼓吹要在越南实现“体面的和平”。
    美帝国主义在越南进行着一场最不体面的侵略战争，而且越是打下去，就越不体面。对美帝国主义来说，最体面的办法，就是趁早滚出越南。约翰逊政府企图实现让美国侵略者永久霸占南越那样的“体面的和平”，是办不到的，结果只能是把面子丢光。
