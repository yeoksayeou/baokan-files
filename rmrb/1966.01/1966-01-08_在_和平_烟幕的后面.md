    Behind the "Peace" Smokescreen

    While the Johnson administration is vigorously engaged in a "peace" hoax on the Vietnam issue, it is stepping up plans to further expand the war of aggression. As admitted by the pre-release issue of the January 10th issue of "Newsweek," the United States "is conducting a noisy peace offensive with one hand, while its other hand is preparing for broader combat in Vietnam should the need arise."

    On December 28th, the day after the US Information Service announced the so-called "Fourteen Points," 4,000 men from the Third Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division of the United States were airlifted from Hawaii to Pleiku in South Vietnam, bringing the number of American troops in South Vietnam to 185,000. According to the American "Christian Science Monitor," the Johnson administration will increase the number of American troops in South Vietnam to 350,000 to 400,000 this year. United Press International quoted US officials on December 27th last year as saying that "a new batch of 150,000 Army reservists could be ready to go to Vietnam by July 1," which would include three divisions, six brigades, and other units. The Associated Press also reported on December 31st last year that the Johnson administration is currently stepping up the implementation of a plan to expand the army by 340,000 men domestically to bring the US military to 3 million.

    To meet the needs of expanding the war, the Johnson administration is preparing to request new appropriations from Congress. According to United Press International on January 4th, "President Johnson will soon request nearly $13 billion in additional defense appropriations to cover the costs of the expanded Vietnam war effort." This would bring the total US military appropriation for the next year to over $62 billion.

    At the same time, the United States is further expanding its transportation capacity for the war of aggression in Vietnam. The US Navy Department announced on December 28th last year a plan to build and refit 224 ships at a cost of $1.9 billion. According to United Press International, the US Congress has approved funds for this plan. Airlift capacity is also rapidly increasing. Last year, the United States airlifted 275,000 troops and non-military personnel and 96,000 tons of supplies to South Vietnam, exceeding the amount airlifted in the thirty months of the Korean War.

    In order to accommodate the growing number of invading troops and stockpile large quantities of combat materials, the United States is not only building large-scale bases, naval ports, airfields, and other military facilities in Cam Ranh Bay and other places in South Vietnam, but also stepping up the expansion of naval and air bases in Thailand to prepare for expanding the war of aggression in Indochina. The American "Time" magazine reported on December 28th last year that the United States is building a large naval air base worth $11.9 million in Sattahip. The United States is also building "the most modern airport in the Far East" in Rayong, Thailand, which can be used by B-52 bombers.

    Not only that, after brazenly declaring the so-called right to invade Cambodia at any time, the United States is also stepping up its instigation of the Thai and South Vietnamese puppet troops to intensify their violations of the Cambodian border, and stepping up preparations to expand the war to Cambodia. According to a dispatch from Hong Kong published in the "Washington Post" on January 2nd, "Two or three US divisions will soon take action near the Cambodian border in central Vietnam."

    The bombing of the Lao liberated areas by American bandit planes has become even more rampant. In the three days of December 27th, 28th, and 29th alone, American planes flew more than 80 sorties, fiercely bombing and strafing the Phou Khout mountain area.

    At the same time, the United States has sent military and political leaders to the Far East one after another to plan the expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam. US Vice President Humphrey visited Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea from December 28th last year to January 2nd this year, attempting to bring these puppets together, organize aggressive military blocs, and serve the United States' conspiracy to expand the war.

    Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler held a series of talks in Bangkok from December 24th to 29th last year with Thai authorities and senior US military and diplomatic officials stationed in Thailand. Then, he went to Taiwan and held secret talks with the military and political leaders of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In addition, on January 1st, US Secretary of the Army Resor, Secretary of the Air Force Brown, and Administrator of the International Development Agency Bell went to Saigon for activities. They will also go to Thailand, Okinawa, Hawaii, and other places that serve as bases for aggression against Vietnam.

    Washington issued a wave of war expansion. Senator Russell, chairman of the Senate Military Subcommittee, advocated escalating the war by using "more personnel and more extensive use of conventional weapons such as bombers" and again demanded the "blockade" of Haiphong. Republican Senator Thurmond clamored even more frantically on December 31st last year: "We should use any force necessary to win the war and save American lives, even if it means using nuclear weapons."

    These sinister schemes carried out by the Johnson administration behind the large-scale "peace offensive" prove that the purpose of its playing the "peace talks" hoax this time is only to buy time for new military adventure deployments and to create excuses for further expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam.

### 在“和平”烟幕的后面

    在“和平”烟幕的后面
    约翰逊政府一面在越南问题上大搞“和平”骗局，一面却加紧策划进一步扩大侵略战争。正象提前出版的一月十日一期《新闻周刊》所承认的，美国“用一只手从事一场喧嚣一时的和平攻势的同时，它的另一只手正在为一旦必要时在越南进行更广泛的战斗作准备。”
    十二月二十八日，也就是美国新闻处公布所谓“十四点”主张的第二天，美国第二十五步兵师第三旅的四千人，从夏威夷空运到南越波来古，使美国在南越的兵力达到十八万五千人。据美国《基督教科学箴言报》透露，约翰逊政府今年将要把在南越的美军人数增加到三十五万至四十万人。合众国际社去年十二月二十七日引用美国官员们的话说，美国“一批新的共计十五万人的陆军后备部队可以准备好在七月一日去越南”，这支后备部队将包括三个师、六个旅和一些其他单位。美联社去年十二月三十一日还报道，目前，约翰逊政府正在国内加紧实施扩军三十四万人的计划，以便使美国军队达到三百万人。
    为适应扩大战争需要，约翰逊政府正在准备向国会要求新的拨款。据合众国际社一月四日透露，“约翰逊总统不久将要求追加防务拨款将近一百三十亿美元，以应付扩大的越南战争努力的开支”。这就使美国下年度军事拨款总额提高到六百二十亿美元以上。
    同时，美国还在进一步扩大侵越战争的运输能力。美国海军部去年十二月二十八日宣布了一项以十九亿美元来修建和改装二百二十四艘船只的计划。据合众国际社报道，美国国会已经批准了这个计划的款项。空运方面也正在迅速增加。去年美国向南越空运了二十七万五千名部队、非军事人员和九万六千吨物资，超过了朝鲜战争中三十个月空运的数量。
    为了容纳日益增多的侵略军队、储备大量的作战物资，美国不仅在南越金兰湾等地大规模修建基地、军港、飞机场及其他军事设施，还加紧在泰国扩建海空基地，为扩大侵略印度支那战争作准备。去年十二月二十八日美国《时代》杂志报道说，美国正在梭桃邑修建价值一千一百九十万美元的大型海军航空基地。美国还在泰国的罗勇修建一个可供B—52轰炸机使用的“远东最现代化的机场”。
    不仅如此，美国在悍然宣布所谓有权随时入侵柬埔寨的决定以后，还加紧唆使泰国和南越傀儡军变本加厉地侵犯柬埔寨边境，加紧准备把战争扩大到柬埔寨。据《华盛顿邮报》一月二日刊登自香港发回的一则电讯说，“美军两个师或三个师不久将在越南中部的柬埔寨边界附近采取行动”。
    美国强盗飞机对老挝解放区的轰炸更加变本加厉。仅在去年十二月二十七日、二十八日和二十九日三天中，美国飞机就出动了八十多架次，猛烈轰炸和扫射富科特山地区。
    在这同时，美国还派遣了军政头目相继到远东进行活动，策划扩大侵越战争。美国副总统汉弗莱从去年十二月二十八日至今年一月二日，先后到日本、菲律宾、台湾和南朝鲜，企图把这些傀儡纠集在一起，组织侵略性的军事集团，为美国扩大战争的阴谋效劳。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒去年十二月二十四日到二十九日，在曼谷与泰国当局和美国驻泰国的高级军事和外交官员举行了一系列会谈。接着，他到台湾与蒋介石集团的军政头目进行了密谈。此外，一月一日，美国陆军部长里索，空军部长布朗和国际开发署署长贝尔到西贡活动，他们还将到作为侵略越南基地的泰国、冲绳、夏威夷等地活动。
    华盛顿发出了一片扩大战争的鼓噪。参议院军事小组委员会主席鲁塞尔鼓吹将使用“更多的人员和更加广泛地使用轰炸机等常规武器”使战争升级，并再次要求
  “封锁”海防。共和党参议员瑟蒙德去年十二月三十一日更疯狂叫嚣说：“我们应当使用任何为打赢战争和拯救美国人的生命所必要的力量，即使这意味着使用核武器也罢。”
    约翰逊政府在大规模“和平攻势”后面加紧进行的这些险恶勾当，证明它这次玩弄“和谈”大骗局的目的，不过是为了争取时间进行新的军事冒险部署，并为进一步扩大侵越战争制造借口。
