    Dahomey's Foreign Ministry Unilaterally Announces Termination of Sino-Dahomean Diplomatic Relations
    I Strongly Protest the Unreasonable Actions of the Dahomey Authorities
    Decision to Withdraw All Personnel from Our Embassy, While Pointing Out That No One Can Destroy the Friendship Between the Chinese and Dahomean People, and the Conspiracy of U.S. Imperialism and Its Followers Will Ultimately Fail
    Xinhua News Agency, January 5th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on January 5th regarding the Dahomey government's unreasonable termination of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey, lodging a serious protest against the Dahomey government's unilateral and unreasonable tearing up of the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey, and its extremely serious actions damaging Sino-Dahomean relations.
    The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Protesting the Unreasonable Termination of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Dahomey by the Government of the Republic of Dahomey
                    January 5, 1966
    On January 3, 1966, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Dahomey handed a note to Li Yun-chuan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of Dahomey, announcing the termination of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey and demanding that the Chinese Embassy leave Dahomean territory within three days from the date of notification. This is an extremely serious event in which the Dahomey government unilaterally and unreasonably tore up the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey and damaged Sino-Dahomean relations. The government of the People's Republic of China lodges a serious protest against this.
    Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey, the government of the People's Republic of China has consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and has been committed to developing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in all fields. This consistent position of the Chinese government is recognized by the Dahomean people and the broad masses of patriots. The Dahomey authorities did not offer any reasons when taking the action to terminate Sino-Dahomean diplomatic relations. This unreasonable behavior of the Dahomey authorities not only damages its own international credibility but also runs counter to the interests of the broad masses of Dahomean patriots and all the people.
    The Chinese government has every reason to reject the aforementioned unreasonable demands of the Dahomey government. However, the Chinese government believes that there is no need to do so and has decided to withdraw all personnel from the Chinese Embassy in the Republic of Dahomey. The Chinese government wishes to point out that the friendship between the Chinese and Dahomean people cannot be destroyed by anyone; the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its followers is doomed to failure.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 5th – Cotonou dispatch: The new government formed after the Chief of Staff of the Dahomean Army, Soglo, took over power, unilaterally tore up the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey on the 3rd, and unreasonably announced the termination of Dahomey's diplomatic relations with China.
    Emile Zinsou, the Foreign Minister of the new Dahomean government, met with Li Yun-chuan, the Chinese Ambassador to Dahomey, on the 3rd and handed him a note from the Dahomean Foreign Ministry to the Chinese Embassy. The note did not offer any reasons, announced the termination of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and demanded that the Chinese Embassy leave Dahomey within three days. Ambassador Li Yun-chuan immediately protested the Dahomean authorities' serious act of deliberately undermining Sino-Dahomean relations.
    The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 5th, strongly protesting the Dahomey government's unilateral tearing up of the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey and its extremely serious actions damaging relations between the two countries, and decided to withdraw all personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Dahomey.
    The Dahomean government and the Chinese government issued a joint communique on November 12, 1964, announcing the decision to formally establish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level. The Dahomean government recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government representing the entire Chinese people.
    Dahomey has been in a political crisis since late November of last year. With the intervention of the Dahomean Army, former President Apithy and former Vice President and Prime Minister Ahomadegbe announced their resignations, respectively, and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Congacou, temporarily assumed the posts of President and Prime Minister of the Republic. On December 22nd, Chief of Staff of the Army, Soglo, announced that the army would temporarily take over power and formed a new government with himself as President and Prime Minister.
    Since the political situation in Dahomey became turbulent, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, has been doing its utmost to undermine the friendly relations between China and Dahomey. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "ambassador" to Togo visited Cotonou twice in early December and held repeated talks with Soglo and then-Dahomean interim President and Prime Minister Congacou.

    达荷美外交部片面宣布终止中达外交关系
    我严重抗议达荷美当局的无理行为
    决定撤回我国大使馆全体人员，同时指出中达两国人民友谊谁也破坏不了，美帝及其追随者的阴谋终将失败
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部五日就达荷美政府无理终止中、达两国外交关系发表声明，对达荷美政府片面无理撕毁中、达两国建交协议，破坏中、达两国关系的极其严重的行为，提出严重抗议。
    声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部抗议达荷美共和国政府无理终止中达两国外交关系的声明
                    一九六六年一月五日
    一九六六年一月三日，达荷美共和国外交部长向中华人民共和国驻达荷美共和国特命全权大使李云川面交照会，宣布终止中、达两国外交关系，并要求中国大使馆自通知之日起三天之内离开达荷美国境。这是达荷美政府片面无理撕毁中、达两国建交协议，破坏中、达两国关系的极其严重的事件。对此，中华人民共和国政府提出严重抗议。
    自从中、达两国建立外交关系以来，中华人民共和国政府一贯根据和平共处五项原则，致力于发展两国在各方面的友好合作关系。中国政府的这种一贯立场是达荷美人民和广大爱国人士所公认的。达荷美当局在采取终止中、达两国外交关系的行动的时候，并没有提出任何理由。达荷美当局的这种无理行为，不仅损害了它自己的国际信誉，而且也是与达荷美广大爱国人士和全体人民的利益背道而驰的。
    中国政府完全有理由拒绝达荷美政府上述的无理要求。但是，中国政府认为没有必要这样做，决定将中国驻达荷美共和国大使馆全体人员撤回。中国政府愿意指出：中、达两国人民的友谊是谁也破坏不了的；美帝国主义及其追随者的阴谋终究是要失败的。
    新华社五日讯　科托努消息：在达荷美陆军参谋长索格洛接管政权后成立的新政府三日片面撕毁中国和达荷美两国建立外交关系的协议，无理宣布终止达荷美同中国的外交关系。
    达荷美新政府外交部长埃米尔·津苏三日接见中国驻达荷美大使李云川，面交了一份达荷美外交部给中国大使馆的照会。照会没有提出任何理由，宣布终止两国之间的外交关系，并且要求中国大使馆在三天之内离开达荷美。李云川大使当即对达荷美当局这种蓄意破坏中、达两国关系的严重行为提出抗议。
    中国外交部一月五日发表声明，严重抗议达荷美政府片面撕毁中达两国建交协议、破坏两国关系的极其严重的行为，并决定从达荷美撤出中国大使馆全体人员。
    达荷美政府和中国政府在一九六四年十一月十二日发表联合公报宣布，决定正式建立大使级外交关系。达荷美政府承认中华人民共和国政府是代表全体中国人民的唯一合法政府。
    从去年十一月下旬以来，达荷美发生了政治危机。在达荷美陆军的干预下，前总统阿皮蒂和前副总统兼总理阿奥马德贝分别宣布辞职，由国民议会议长贡加库临时执行共和国总统和总理职务。十二月二十二日，陆军参谋长索格洛宣布由军队暂时接管政权，并成立了由他自己担任总统和总理的新政府。
    自达荷美政局发生动荡以来，美帝国主义勾结蒋介石集团竭力破坏中、达两国之间的友好关系。蒋介石集团驻多哥“大使”十二月上旬曾两次去科托努进行活动，同索格洛和当时的达荷美临时总统兼总理贡加库一再进行了会谈。
