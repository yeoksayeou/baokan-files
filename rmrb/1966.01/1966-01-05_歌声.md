	Song of the Voice

	Ideological work must be timely and proactive. -- Instructor Chen Jianfei's words
	The human factor is primary; living thought is primary. How to do a good job in working with people and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the millions of masses is the guarantee for the victory of our socialist revolution and socialist construction. Starting today, the supplement will publish several stories of instructors from the Daqing Oilfield. The comrades of Daqing Oilfield creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and their ideological work is done actively and deeply, which is worth learning by everyone. Many factories, mines, and rural areas now have instructors. There must also be many moving stories in the work. Welcome everyone to write down such stories and send them to us for publication.
	Every evening, a burst of singing often drifts from the residence of the Fourth Team of the Fourth Mining Area of the oilfield. This singing, with the night wind, drifts far, far away…
	If you follow the singing, you will surely find a seventeen-year-old girl named Cui Fenglan. When she had just graduated from a secondary technical school, she did not expect that she would be assigned to this nationally famous oilfield. When she arrived at the oilfield, she did not expect to be assigned to this iron-willed oil extraction team, famous throughout the entire oilfield. The warmth of the Party and the care of the comrades filled her life with hope and truly made her feel happy. Whenever she thought of these things, she couldn't help but sing out loud…
	However, before long, Cui Fenglan's singing could no longer be heard. What was the reason? Instructor Chen Jianfei immediately found the well captain of Cui Fenglan, Zhu Xinyu, and asked: "Is Xiao Cui sick?"
	"No." Zhu Xinyu felt strange.
	"If she's not, why can't I hear her singing?" The instructor reminded Zhu Xinyu:
	"Find out…"
	Sure enough, the instructor was right. It turned out that Cui Fenglan had received several letters from her father in succession, saying that her mother was very ill and wanted her to go home quickly. Cui Fenglan was very conflicted. If she went home to see her, her parents had complained that she was too young when she came to the oilfield, fearing that she would suffer hardships and not wanting her to come. If she went back now, wouldn't all the hopes and happiness she had imagined be over if her parents didn't let her come out again? If she didn't go home, her mother had loved her the most since she was a child. Now that her mother was seriously ill and only her father was taking care of her at home, how could she not go to see her? Thinking about it, she couldn't think of a good way.
	Once this matter spread, the comrades were all worried about her. The classmates who came together were afraid of losing a confidante, those who liked to sing were afraid of losing a companion, and the well captain Zhu Xinyu was also afraid of losing his best apprentice. He quickly asked the instructor what to do.
	"What are her own plans?" the instructor asked.
	"She can't make up her mind."
	The instructor relaxed his brow and said decisively, "Let her go home and see!"
	"Can she come back to the team?" Zhu Xinyu was very worried.
	"I think she will come back."
	The instructor knew Cui Fenglan very well. From the first day Cui Fenglan came, he discovered that this girl loved the oilfield and loved her work. Now, her parents want her to go back, and it is very likely that they will not want her to come again. But as long as the work is done thoroughly, so that she is always thinking about the collective and the oilfield, how can she not come back? Therefore, he instructed Zhu Xinyu to do the work thoroughly.
	That evening, Zhu Xinyu talked to Cui Fenglan. They talked about the bright future of the oilfield, and also about the brilliant achievements of their iron-willed oil extraction team. Talking about Cui Fenglan's work, Zhu Xinyu summarized it in twelve characters: diligent in learning, rapid progress, great future. Early the next morning, Zhu Xinyu, on behalf of the team leaders and workers, took Cui Fenglan to the train station, bought her a ticket, and bought canned food and snacks for her parents. Cui Fenglan was very moved. As the train slowly started, she said excitedly: "I really hate to leave everyone!"
	"Everyone hates to leave you too." Zhu Xinyu waved his hand and said: "I wish you a safe journey, and come back when your mother recovers. All the comrades in the team are waiting for you…."
	When Cui Fenglan arrived home, she learned that her mother was about to give birth, and her father wanted her to come back to take care of her mother. At that time, she really wanted to return to the oilfield immediately, but then she thought that the team had given her half a month's leave, so she should wait until her mother gave birth to the child before going back. Unexpectedly, time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed, but her mother had not yet given birth, and she couldn't help but feel anxious. One evening, she said to her parents: "The vacation is over, I have to hurry back to the oilfield."
	"We called you back because we didn't want you to go!" her father said.
	Cui Fenglan was anxious: "The oilfield needs people more!"
	"I believe they need people, but what use can you be." The father did not think much of his daughter: "Life at home is pretty good now, there is no need for you to go out and earn money."
	Seeing that she couldn't agree with her father, Cui Fenglan asked her mother to intercede. When her mother heard that she was still going to leave, she was afraid that she would suffer hardships outside, grabbed her clothes and cried, refusing to let her go no matter what.
	Cui Fenglan was distressed and hesitated.
	At this critical juncture, letters from the comrades of the team flew in one after another. It turned out that when she was supposed to return to the team but didn't, the instructor estimated that there was a problem in the middle. What was the problem? Of course, not everything was clear. Either her mother's illness was very serious and she couldn't leave for a while; or her parents did not understand the oilfield and the work of their daughter, and would not let her come back. Thinking of these things, the instructor decided to write a letter to Cui Fenglan and mobilize everyone to write letters to Cui Fenglan. He firmly believed that as long as her parents understood the situation, there would be no worry that Cui Fenglan would not return to the team.
	Things developed exactly as the instructor thought.
	Cui Fenglan was overjoyed when she received the letters from her comrades. She read each letter to her parents, and after reading a few letters, her parents' attitude changed. Some letters were from classmates, saying how much new technology they had learned, and they were all waiting for her to come back and teach them to them. Some letters were from the well captain, saying that their oil extraction well had become a red banner well, and she had a share of the credit. Instructor Chen Jianfei's letter on behalf of the Party branch started by writing about the excellent situation of the oilfield, and also gave a very high evaluation of Cui Fenglan's work. At the end of the letter, he also expressed warm condolences to her parents, saying that they were glorious to have such a good daughter and should let the Party cultivate her well and make more contributions to the socialist cause of the motherland.
	Her father couldn't help but think deeply when he heard this. Originally, his family was very poor in the past, but only after the Communist Party came did his family completely turn over. Today, he doesn't want to call his daughter back to the oilfield, but the instructor explained the truth so thoroughly, how can he not listen! Thinking of this, he asked his wife: "What do you think we should do?"
	Her mother felt particularly happy when she heard the instructor praise her daughter, and said, "Do whatever you say."
	"Who will take care of you if our daughter leaves?"
	"Can't we invite her aunt over?"
	This was something Cui Fenglan had not expected, and she was so happy that she almost jumped up. She immediately sent a letter to her aunt, asking her to come and help her mother. The aunt also loved Cui Fenglan. Upon receiving the letter, she quickly came over.
	One clear afternoon, Cui Fenglan returned to the oilfield. The captain, instructor, and comrades all came to warmly welcome her, and she also looked particularly radiant. After that, a burst of singing often drifted from the residence of the Fourth Team of the Fourth Mining Area of the oilfield, drifting farther and farther with the night wind… (Spring, 1964)

    思想工作，一定要及时、主动。——指导员陈剑飞的话
    人的因素第一，活的思想第一。如何做好人的工作，把千百万群众的积极性调动起来，是我们社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得胜利的保证。副刊从今天起，将陆续刊载几篇大庆油田指导员的故事。大庆油田的同志活学活用毛主席著作，思想工作做得活，做得深，值得大家学习。现在许多工矿和农村都设有指导员，工作中一定也有许多动人的故事，欢迎大家把这样的故事写出来，寄给我们，以供发表。
    一到傍晚，从采油四矿四队的住地上，经常飘出一阵阵的歌声；这歌声随着夜来的风，飘向很远、很远。……
    如果顺着歌声找去，准能找到一个十七岁的姑娘，她名叫崔凤兰。当她刚从中等技术学校毕业的时候，没有想到自己会被分配到这个闻名全国的油田上来。到了油田，更没有想到自己会分配到这个闻名全油田的钢铁采油队来。党的温暖、同志们的关怀，都使她的生活充满了希望，真正地感到了幸福，一想到这些，她就不能不放声来歌唱。……
    然而，没过多久，却听不到崔凤兰的歌声了。这是什么原因？指导员陈剑飞立刻找到崔凤兰的井长朱新玉问道：“小崔病了吗？”
    “没有。”朱新玉觉得奇怪。
      “没有，怎么听不见她唱歌呢？”指导员提醒朱新玉说：
  “你了解了解吧……”
    果然不出指导员所料。原来，崔凤兰一连接到了父亲的好几封来信，说是她的母亲病很重，要她赶快回家去。崔凤兰内心很矛盾，回家看看吧，她来油田的时候，父母亲就嫌她年龄小，怕她吃苦受累，不愿她来，现在回去，父母亲要是不让她再出来，她憧憬着的一切希望和幸福不是都完了吗？不回家吧，她的母亲从小最疼爱她，现在母亲病重，家里只有父亲一个人照顾，自己不看看，那怎能行呢？想来想去，总是想不出个好办法来。
    这件事一传开来，同志们都替她操心。一起来的同学害怕失去了知己，喜欢唱歌的怕失去了同伴，井长朱新玉也怕失去了最好的徒弟，他连忙去问指导员怎么办？
      “她自己有什么打算呢？”指导员问道。
      “她拿不定个主意。”
    指导员放开了眉头，果断地说：“让她回家看看吧！”
      “她能回到队上来吗？”朱新玉很担心。
      “我看她是会回来的。”
    指导员对崔凤兰是很了解的。从崔凤兰来的第一天起，他便发现这个姑娘是热爱油田、热爱工作的。现在，父母亲要她回去，很可能不要她再来，但是只要把工作做透，使她时时刻刻都想着集体，想着油田，她怎能不回来呢？于是，他叮咛朱新玉要把工作做透。
    这天晚间，朱新玉便同崔凤兰谈起来。他们谈到了油田的光辉前景，又谈到了他们钢铁采油队的辉煌成就，谈到崔凤兰的工作，朱新玉给她概括了十二个字：学习努力，进步很快，前途远大。第二天一早，朱新玉又代表队的领导和工人，把崔凤兰送到了火车站，给她买了票，又给她的父母买了罐头和点心。崔凤兰很感动，火车慢慢开动了，她激动地说：“我真舍不得离开大伙啊！”
      “大伙也是舍不得离开你。”朱新玉挥着手说：“祝你一路平安，等妈妈病好再回来，全队同志们都在等着你……。”
    崔凤兰一到家，才知道母亲要生孩子，她父亲是要她回来侍候母亲的。当时，她真是想马上就回油田的，后来一想，队上给了她半个月的假，等母亲生了孩子再回去吧。没有料到，时间过得挺快，转眼就是半个月，可是母亲还没有生产，她不能不着急了。一天晚间，她向父母亲说道：“假期满了，我得赶回油田去。”
    “叫你回来，就是不要你去呀！”她父亲说。
    崔凤兰急了：“油田上更需要人啊！”
      “要人我是相信的，可你能顶什么用。”父亲把女儿没有放在眼里：“现在家里生活挺好，不需要你出去挣钱。”
    崔凤兰看到同父亲说不到一起，便求母亲从中说情。母亲一听说她还要走，怕她在外面吃苦受累，拉住她的衣襟哭起来，死活也不要她走。
    崔凤兰苦恼了，犹豫了。
    就在这节骨眼上，队上同志们的信件一件接一件地飞来了。原来，当她该要回队而没回去的时候，指导员就估计这中间有问题。什么问题，当然不全清楚。要么，她母亲的病很重，一时离不开；要么，她的父母对油田和对自己女儿的工作不了解，不让她回来。想到这些，指导员决定写信给崔凤兰，并发动大家写信给崔凤兰，他坚信只要她的父母亲了解了情况，不愁崔凤兰回不到队上来。
    事情正是按着指导员的想法发展的。
    崔凤兰接到同志们来信，那个高兴的劲儿不用说了。来一封，就给父母亲念一封，念了几封之后，她父母亲的态度便不一样了。有的信是同学来的，说她们又学了多少新技术，都等着她回去教给她。有的信是井长来的，说他们的采油井成了红旗井，也有她的一份功劳。指导员陈剑飞代表党支部的来信，一开始便写了油田的大好形势，对崔凤兰的工作，也作了很高的评价，在信的末尾，还对她的父母亲表示热情的慰问，说他们有了这样好的女儿，是个光荣，应该让党好好地培养，为祖国的社会主义做出更多的成绩来。
    她父亲听到这里，不由得沉思起来。原来，过去他家是很苦的，只是来了共产党，他家才彻底翻了身。今天，他不想叫女儿回到油田上去，可是指导员把道理讲得那么透，他怎能不听啊！想到这里，他便问老伴：“你看怎么办？”
    她的母亲听到指导员夸她的女儿，心里也感到特别的高兴，便说：“你说咋办就咋办。”
    “女儿走了，谁侍候你？”
    “把她舅母请来不行吗？”
    这是崔凤兰没有料到的事情，她高兴得几乎要跳起来。当时就给舅母发了信，请她来帮助母亲。舅母也是爱崔凤兰的，接到信，很快就赶来了。
    一个晴朗的下午，崔凤兰回到了油田。队长、指导员和同志们，都来热烈欢迎，而她也格外显得精神焕发。这以后，采油四矿四队的住地，又经常飘出一阵阵的歌声，随着夜来的风，飘向更远、更远……。（一九六四年春）
