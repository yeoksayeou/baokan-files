    How to Achieve "Less but Better"
    "Better" should mean that teachers can solve practical problems in production, and students can master practical skills that can be applied to their studies.
    In the past, I always thought I was very knowledgeable and remarkable. The Party committee repeatedly emphasized "facing the countryside, facing production," seeking knowledge from practice, and learning from peasants, but I always couldn't quite understand it. Recently, I participated in the socialist education movement in Linchuan and received a profound education. One vivid example after another irrefutably proves that Chairman Mao's statement that "many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant" is an absolutely true principle. A simple example can illustrate this.
    For example, I always thought I was very familiar with the issue of cows giving birth. However, this time in the countryside, when I encountered a cow calving, I didn't dare to assist, so I had to watch the old breeder, Deng Shouyuan, deliver the calf from the sidelines. I saw the old man carefully caring for the cow, feeding it grass and water at regular intervals, and letting it lie down to rest. After the calf was born, he quickly and skillfully peeled its hooves, and the calf immediately ran off to graze. Not only could I not do these things, but some of our biology teachers didn't even know about peeling hooves! This was indeed a vivid on-site lesson for me. In the future, when I teach the lesson on cow calving again, it will definitely be much more vivid than what's in the book.
    From this, I thought about why students can't apply the knowledge we teach. It's because we ourselves lack practical knowledge and have a superficial understanding of the issues. Now we are implementing the teaching principle of "less but better." What exactly is "better"? Practice tells me that "better" should mean that teachers can solve practical problems in production, and students can master practical skills that can be applied to their studies. This seems simple, but it is actually not easy to do. It cannot be achieved without the spirit of putting aside airs and willingly becoming a primary school student.

    怎样才能少而精
    精，应当是教师能解决生产中的实际问题，让学生也能掌握学以致用的实践本领。
    过去我一直以为自己很有知识，了不起。党委一再提出要“面向农村，面向生产”，要向实际求知识，向农民学习，我总是有些想不通。最近，到临川参加社会主义教育运动，受到了深刻的教育。一件件生动的事例无可辩驳地证明：毛主席说的“许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的”这句话，是千真万确的真理。随便举个例子就可以说明。
    比如关于母牛分娩的问题，我总认为我是很熟悉的。但是这次在乡下，碰到一头母牛生崽，我却不敢接，只好在一旁看老饲养员邓寿元接生。我看见老大爷细心地护理母牛，按一定时候给母牛吃草、喝水，让它躺下休息。小牛生下后，他迅速熟练地给小牛剥蹄，小牛马上就跑去吃草了。这些不仅我不会做，而且我们有的生物老师连剥蹄这回事还不知道啦！母牛分娩后，老大爷用了一个很简单的办法，就将胎衣迅速排出，要是我，就一点办法也没有。在这里，的确给我上了一堂生动的现场课，以后叫我再讲母牛分娩这一课时，一定会比书上讲得生动得多。
    由此，我想到，我们教的知识，学生为什么不会用？就是因为我们自己没有实践知识，对问题一知半解。现在我们贯彻“少而精”的教学原则，“精”到底是什么呢？实践告诉我，“精”，应当是教师能解决生产中的实际问题，让学生也能掌握学以致用的实践本领。这看起来很简单，实际做起来却不容易，没有放下架子甘当小学生的精神，就做不到。
