　　Scientific Research Departments Cultivate Six New Sugar Beet Varieties
　　These Varieties Have Characteristics Such as High Yield, High Quality, and Strong Stress Resistance; Their Sugar Content and Sugar Yield per Unit Area are Relatively High
　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin – Six new sugar beet varieties with high yield, high quality, and strong stress resistance have been successfully cultivated in various sugar beet producing areas of China.
　　These six sugar beet varieties, named "Gongxi No. 5," "Shuangfeng No. 1," "Shuangfeng No. 2," "Neimeng No. 1," "Neimeng No. 2," and "Hezuo No. 2," were successfully cultivated by the Sugar Beet Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Jilin Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Heilongjiang Sugar Beet Sugar Industry Research Institute. This is the first batch of sugar beet varieties cultivated by Chinese scientific workers themselves.
　　The six new sugar beet varieties demonstrated good performance in the national variety regional trials from 1962 to 1964. Their sugar content and sugar yield per unit area are relatively high.
　　China began to introduce and plant sugar beets in the early 20th century. However, before liberation, the sugar beet planting area nationwide was not large, and the sugar industry developed very slowly. After the founding of New China, sugar beet cultivation developed rapidly. In order to change the state of complete dependence on imports for sugar beet seeds, Chinese sugar beet scientific researchers actively sorted out and improved folk sugar beet varieties, and at the same time, introduced a large number of foreign species for trial planting, selecting and breeding varieties suitable for planting in various sugar beet producing areas. Various scientific research departments also cooperated with production units to establish a seed breeding system, greatly accelerating the speed of seed breeding. In 1963, the seeds needed for sugar beet production nationwide were already completely self-sufficient. The seeds bred in 1965 alone can meet the needs of the country for planting sugar beets for three years.

    科学研究部门培育出六个甜菜新品种
    这些品种具有丰产、质高、抗逆性强等特点，它们含糖率和单位面积产糖量都比较高
    新华社哈尔滨电　六个具有丰产、质高、抗逆性强的甜菜新品种，已经在我国各甜菜产区培育成功。
    这六个命名为“公系五号”、“双丰一号”、“双丰二号”、“内蒙一号”、“内蒙二号”、“合作二号”的甜菜品种，是由中国科学院甜菜研究所、内蒙古自治区、吉林省农业科学院、黑龙江甜菜糖业研究所培育成功的。这是中国科学工作者自己培育出的第一批甜菜品种。
    六个新甜菜品种在一九六二年到一九六四年的国家品种区域试验中，表现出了良好的性能。它们的含糖率和单位面积产糖量都比较高。
    我国从二十世纪初就开始引进种植糖用甜菜。但是，解放前全国甜菜种植面积并不大，制糖工业发展十分缓慢。新中国成立以后，甜菜种植业才得到了迅速发展。为了改变甜菜种子完全依赖进口的状态，我国甜菜科学研究人员一面积极整理和提高民间甜菜品种，一面又从国外大量引种试验，选育适合各甜菜产区种植的品种。各科学研究部门还和生产单位合作，建立了种子繁育体系，大大加快了种子繁育速度。一九六三年，全国生产甜菜所需要的种子已经全部自给。一九六五年一年繁殖的种子，可以满足全国三年种植甜菜的需要。
