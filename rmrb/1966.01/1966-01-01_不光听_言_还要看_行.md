    Not Only Listen to "Words," But Also Watch "Actions"
    I have been working in the revolution for over ten years. In words, I know that we serve the people, but deep down in my mind, it is not entirely the case. In action, I sometimes cannot break free from my own little world. Especially when personal interests conflict with revolutionary interests, I often put personal interests first.
    These situations show that although I have been in the revolutionary ranks for more than ten years, I have not yet been able to be as wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution and serving the people as Comrade Wang Jie. In previous revolutionary movements, my ideological awareness has improved to some extent, and I have repeatedly resolved to transform myself, solve the problem of "serving whom," and cut down the poisonous weed of individualism many times, but I have never completely eradicated it. Once it encounters suitable climate and soil, it sprouts again. I deeply realize that to solve the problem of who defeats whom in my own ideological realm, and to truly solve the problem of "serving whom," it is easy to say, but in practice, it cannot be thoroughly solved without long-term and arduous ideological struggle.
    Therefore, I believe that the most urgent problem to be solved in order to achieve the revolutionization of leadership is still the fundamental problem of "serving whom." If this problem is solved well, even in an ordinary position, outstanding achievements can be made.

    不光听“言”还要看“行”
    我参加革命工作已经十多年了。在口头上，也知道我们是为人民服务的，但在思想深处，却并不完全如此，在行动上有时还是摆脱不了自己的小天地。尤其是在个人利益与革命利益发生矛盾的时候，往往总是将个人利益放在前面。
    这些情况说明，尽管我置身在革命队伍里十多年了，但是还没有做到象王杰同志那样一心为革命，全心全意为人民服务。在历次革命运动中，思想觉悟有所提高，也一再下过决心改造自己，解决“为谁服务”问题，割过多次个人主义这棵毒草，却总是没有割彻底，一遇到适宜的气候、土壤，就又抽芽了。我深刻地体会到，要解决自己思想领域里谁战胜谁的问题，真正地解决“为谁服务”的问题，说说容易，做起来，不经过长期的、艰苦的思想斗争，就不能彻底解决。
    所以我认为要实现领导革命化，最迫切需要解决的问题，还是“为谁服务”这个根本问题。这个问题解决得好，即使在平凡的岗位上，也可以作出出色的成绩来。
