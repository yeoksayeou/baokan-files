    Following actual circumstances to determine the working policy is the most basic working method that all Communists must firmly remember.：「Talks at the Cadre Conference in Jin Sui」
    Give Full Play to the Role of Handicraft Industry and Better Serve Agricultural Production
    Deputy Minister of the Second Ministry of Light Industry　Deng Jie
    In the new upsurge of agricultural production across the country, vigorously developing semi-mechanized farm tools is an extremely important task for industrial departments, especially the handicraft industry, to face the countryside and support agriculture. It is also an urgent requirement for the development of socialist agricultural economy by the people's communes in our country.
  Actively Developing Semi-mechanized Farm Tools is
        the Inevitable Path to Achieving Agricultural Mechanization
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The fundamental solution for agriculture lies in mechanization." He also said: "Do not sit and wait for agricultural machinery and relax the promotion of new-style animal-powered farm tools and improved farm tools." Practice has proven that this instruction is completely correct. Achieving agricultural mechanization requires a long-term development process. It is impossible to achieve agricultural mechanization without going through the semi-mechanization of agricultural production tools. Only on the basis of gradually realizing the semi-mechanization of agricultural production tools can we gradually realize agricultural mechanization. It can be said that actively developing semi-mechanized farm tools is the inevitable path to achieving agricultural mechanization in our country.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Following actual circumstances to determine the working policy is the most basic working method that all Communists must firmly remember." According to the current actual situation, my country's basic industry cannot fully meet the needs of agricultural development. In a certain period of time, it cannot provide a large number of large-scale agricultural machinery. At the same time, at this stage, the rural people's commune is a three-level ownership system with the production team as the basic accounting unit, and its economic capacity cannot purchase a large number of agricultural machinery; because the production team is relatively small in scale, it is not suitable for centralized use of large-scale agricultural machinery, or it can be used but cannot fully exert the effectiveness of agricultural machinery. It should also be seen that at present, the widespread use of agricultural machinery in rural areas is not followed up by technical forces. Driving personnel and maintenance forces are insufficient, and there is a need to improve the cultural and technical level of farmers; many rural areas do not have electricity, and power fuels such as coal and gasoline cannot be fully supplied. Therefore, to realize the modernization and mechanization of agricultural production in our country, we must go through a long process of research, experimentation, manufacturing and promotion. However, with the arrival of the new upsurge of agricultural production, the continuous expansion of farmland capital construction, the improvement of intensive cultivation requirements, and the further development of diversified operations, the shortage of labor force during busy farming seasons and in certain operations is becoming more and more prominent, and there is an urgent need for semi-mechanized farm tools to improve work efficiency and operation quality. At the same time, due to the adoption of new fertilizers and new seeds, it is also necessary to add some new farm tools. Under such circumstances, only by developing a large number of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools, and by realizing agricultural semi-mechanization and then mechanization, can we adapt to the needs of agricultural production development. If we do not think deeply about how to solve the urgent needs of agricultural production and wait for mechanization, we will inevitably deviate from reality, deviate from the masses, and seriously affect the development of agricultural production. Some comrades do not see, or even deny, the important role of semi-mechanized farm tools in agricultural technology reform. They believe that semi-mechanized farm tools are simple in structure, inefficient, do not meet "scientific" requirements, and cannot solve major problems. This view is wrong.
    In 1964, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council proposed "adhering to both mechanization and semi-mechanization, and taking semi-mechanization as the main focus for a considerable period of time." Experience has proven that this policy is fully in line with my country's actual situation. In the reform of agricultural technology, there must be two hands, one hand grasping mechanization and the other hand grasping semi-mechanization, and walking on two legs. Going through semi-mechanization and gradually developing to mechanization is the way to achieve agricultural modernization in our country in a faster, better and more economical way. We must create a complete and systematic theory of agricultural modernization in our country in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle and scientific experiment, and create semi-mechanized farm tools and large-scale agricultural machines suitable for our national conditions.
        Letting Go of Mobilizing the Masses to Develop Semi-mechanized Farm Tools
    How to develop semi-mechanized farm tools? The fundamental method is to let go of mobilizing the masses and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. In 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong said that agricultural tool research institutes should be universally established from the province to the county to gather a group of scientific and technical personnel and experienced blacksmiths and carpenters in rural areas to collect various relatively advanced agricultural tools for comparison, experimentation, and improvement, and to trial-produce new-style agricultural tools. Practice has proven that fully exerting the power of the vast number of handicraft cooperative organizations, closely combining with the peasant masses, and implementing the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is the correct path to develop semi-mechanized farm tools in a faster, better and more economical way.
    According to the current actual situation, my country has a vast territory, complex terrain and climate, and a wide variety of crops. To enable semi-mechanized farm tools to fully meet the needs of plowing, sowing, cultivating, fertilizing, irrigation, plant protection, harvesting, transportation, threshing, processing, farmland capital construction, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, etc. on the more than 2 billion mu of land in the country, and to adapt to different regions, different soils, different crops, and different farming systems in the southeast, northwest, water paddy fields, dry lands, plains, and hills in our country is an extremely arduous and complex task. Agriculture in our country has a long tradition of intensive cultivation, and the variety of farm tools required is very large, and the quantity is also extremely large. It is not possible to meet the needs by relying solely on existing modern agricultural machinery factories to produce them; and it is not only unreasonable but also unrealistic to rely on the state to invest heavily in building new agricultural machinery factories in a short period of time.
    There are more than 25,000 handicraft factories and cooperatives producing agricultural tools, with more than 810,000 employees and members specializing in the production of agricultural tools. These enterprises are located in cities and towns and rural areas across the country. Since the cooperativeization of handicrafts in my country, the technical level has been greatly improved. At present, the degree of mechanization of handicraft factories and cooperatives across the country has reached about 25%. The iron and wood industries in most provinces, prefectures, and cities, and a part of the key agricultural tool factories and cooperatives in county towns, have basically achieved semi-mechanized and mechanized production. It can be seen that handicraft factories and cooperatives are an important force in manufacturing semi-mechanized farm tools, and they are also vanguard troops serving on the front line of industry supporting agriculture, providing door-to-door service, repairing farm tools, imparting technology. Giving play to the characteristics of handicrafts that are flexible and adaptable, and better combining with farmers to create and imitate a large number and variety of semi-mechanized farm tools according to the needs of agricultural production, is of great significance for promoting agricultural production and implementing agricultural technology reform.
    Handicraft factories and cooperatives have always produced medium and small-sized farm tools, have close relations with farmers, and are familiar with the rural situation. Reforming on the basis of old-style farm tools can better meet the requirements of farmers. For example, enclosed waterwheels, liberated waterwheels, deep plows, new-style walking plows, animal-powered disc harrows, seeders, etc., are all based on old-style farm tools, and are improvements and developments on the basis of preserving the excellent traditional craftsmanship of my country's handicrafts. Therefore, the reforms are fast, many, and easy to promote. They take root in the masses and are welcomed by the vast number of farmers.
    Handicraft factories and cooperatives are widely distributed and have relatively flexible production and management methods. They can promptly study and manufacture various types of semi-mechanized farm tools according to the local farming seasons, crop varieties, and cultivation methods to meet the needs of agricultural production. This facilitates on-site material acquisition, on-site manufacturing, on-site sales, and on-site repairs. For example, handicraft factories and cooperatives in Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, and other places promptly created, imitated, and repaired a large number of semi-mechanized water lifting tools such as water hammer pumps, well drilling machines, and power waterwheels according to the severe drought since the summer of 1965, making outstanding contributions to the drought resistance and rush planting of wheat. Handicraft factories and cooperatives in various provinces and cities have manufactured a large number of harvesters, threshers, and chaff cutters to supply local communes and teams in response to the tight labor force during the local summer harvest and autumn harvest busy seasons. In Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province alone, more than 2,600 rice and wheat dual-purpose threshers were produced and promoted in the first half of last year, which not only improved work efficiency and saved labor, but also solved the problem of difficult threshing of new rice varieties.
    Handicraft factories and cooperatives have a fine tradition of operating diligently and thriftily, with low management costs and are good at utilizing waste materials. The semi-mechanized farm tools produced have lower costs and can adapt to the purchasing power level of rural production teams. At present, the prices of various threshers produced by handicraft factories and cooperatives in various places are generally around 100 yuan per unit, and the least is only a dozen yuan. The small electric rice milling machine produced by Guce Iron Industry Cooperative in Fangshan County, Beijing, mills 450 jin of rice per hour, and the ex-factory price of each unit is 60 yuan, which is cheap and good, and is very suitable for production teams to purchase and use.
    Semi-mechanized farm tools have a relatively simple structure and do not require very precise processing. The use of raw materials is not as strict as that of large-scale agricultural machinery, which is suitable for the current technical conditions of handicraft factories and cooperatives. Relying on the power of handicrafts to undertake the main tasks of semi-mechanized farm tools and improved farm tools can save the country a lot of funds, and can free up the country's resources to develop large-scale mechanized farm tools more. At the same time, after handicraft factories and cooperatives combine with the peasant masses to create semi-mechanized farm tools suitable for different agricultural needs, the state can research and improve them on the basis of mass creation, and manufacture Chinese-style, high-efficiency mechanized farm tools. In this way, it can be done in combination with popularization and improvement, which is conducive to accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization in my country. The mobile service teams of handicraft factories and cooperatives in the southeast of Shanxi Province to support agriculture are a good form of handicrafts serving agriculture. They bring rice milling machines, flour milling machines, chaff cutters, threshers, and repair tools, and travel to villages to mill rice, grind flour, cut chaff, thresh, and repair agricultural machinery for production teams and peasant masses, bringing convenience to farmers and technology to rural areas, which has powerfully promoted agricultural production and has been universally welcomed by farmers. Farmers said: "With small machines in the mountains, there is no need to be angry to mill rice and grind flour. Thank you, old worker brothers, thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao." At the same time, due to the publicity, demonstration, and promotion of the mobile service teams, since 1965, nine types of products, such as rubber stone rice milling machines, centrifugal flour mills, feed pulverizers, chaff cutters, well drilling machines, and sprayers, have been selected and finalized in the handicraft departments of the entire prefecture, and the design of the products has been improved and the quality has been improved according to the opinions of the farmers.
    The Development of Semi-mechanized Farm Tools Should Be Combined With the Production of Medium and Small-Sized Farm Tools
    At present, most of the semi-mechanized farm tools are reformed and developed by handicraft factories and cooperatives in various places on the basis of old-style farm tools. According to preliminary statistics from 19 provinces and cities such as Shanxi and Fujian, from January to September 1965, more than 100 types of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools were produced, a total of more than 1.3 million pieces, accounting for about 80% of the total number of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools in these areas. However, it should also be seen that at present, semi-mechanized farm tools are still far from meeting the needs of agricultural production development in terms of variety and quantity, and the development is also unbalanced between regions. We need to carefully summarize experience, improve understanding, increase confidence, and promote the further development of semi-mechanized farm tools. In the work process, we must adhere to proceeding from reality, adapting to local conditions, and paying attention to practical results; we must adhere to the mass line, closely combine with rural communes and teams, establish model factories and cooperatives, establish pilot points, and gradually promote them through the use and appraisal of the peasant masses.
    It should also be seen that, according to the actual situation in our country, medium and small-sized farm tools will still be indispensable tools for agricultural production for a considerable period of time. The production of medium and small-sized farm tools should not be relaxed because we want to actively develop semi-mechanized farm tools. We must develop semi-mechanized farm tools on the basis of ensuring a full supply of medium and small-sized farm tools. Special attention should also be paid to widely organizing forces, imparting technology, and solving the problem of agricultural machinery repair. Specific planning should be carried out according to the principle of combining concentration and decentralization, combining backbone and general, combining specialization and sideline, and combining manufacturing and repair. Generally speaking, diverse organizational forms and management methods should be adopted to fully exploit the flexible and mobile production and management characteristics of handicraft factories and cooperatives.
    Industrial support for agriculture is a major strategic task and a fundamental issue in the entire national economy. We must further improve our ideological understanding, clarify the direction of production, face the countryside, wholeheartedly serve agricultural production, and push forward the work of supporting agriculture.

    按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。：《在晋绥干部会议上的讲话》
    充分发挥手工业的作用，更好地为农业生产服务
    第二轻工业部副部长　邓洁
    在全国农业生产的新高潮中，大力发展半机械化农具，是工业部门特别是手工业部门面向农村，支援农业的一项极为重大的任务，也是我国人民公社发展社会主义农业经济的一个迫切要求。
  积极发展半机械化农具是实现农业
          机械化的必由之路
    毛泽东同志说过：“农业的根本出路在于机械化。”又说：“不要坐等农业机器而放松了新式畜力农具和改良农具的推广。”实践证明，这一指示是完全正确的。实现农业机械化需要经历一个长期的发展过程，不经过农业生产工具的半机械化，就不可能实现农业机械化。只有在逐步实现农业生产工具半机械化的基础上，才能逐步实现农业机械化。可以说，积极发展半机械化农具是实现我国农业机械化的必由之路。
    毛泽东同志说过：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。”根据目前的实际情况，我国基础工业还不能充分满足农业发展的需要，它在一定时期内，还不可能提供大量的大型农业机械。同时，现阶段农村人民公社是以生产队为基本核算单位的三级所有制，经济能力还不可能大量的购买农业机械；由于生产队规模比较小，也不适宜于集中使用大型的农业机械，或者是能够使用但不能充分发挥农业机械的效用。还应当看到，目前，农村广泛使用农业机器，技术力量也跟不上，驾驶人员和维修力量都不足，需要有一个提高农民文化、技术水平的过程；农村许多地区还没有电力，煤炭、汽油等动力燃料也不能充分供应。因此，要实现我国农业生产现代化、机械化，必须经历一个较长时间的研究、试验和制造推广的过程。但是，随着农业生产新高潮的到来，农田基本建设的不断扩大，精耕细作要求的提高，多种经营的进一步开展，农忙时及某些作业上劳动力不足的情况越来越突出，迫切需要半机械化农具，以提高工效，提高操作质量。同时，由于新肥料、新种籽的采用，也需要增加一些新式农具。在这种情况下，只有大量发展改良农具和半机械化农具，通过实现农业的半机械化进而实现机械化，才能适应农业生产发展的需要。如果我们不深思熟虑地谋求解决农业生产的紧急需要，而坐等机械化，势必脱离实际，脱离群众，严重影响农业生产的发展。有的同志看不到、甚至否定半机械化农具在农业技术改革中的重要作用，他们认为半机械化农具结构简单，效率不高，不合“科学”要求，不能解决重大问题。这种看法是错误的。
    一九六四年，中共中央和国务院提出“坚持机械化，半机械化并举，在相当长的时期内以半机械化为主的方针”。经验证明，这个方针是完全符合我国的实际情况的。在农业技术改革中，要有两手，一手抓机械化，一手抓半机械化，两条腿走路。经过半机械化，逐步发展到机械化是多快好省实现我国农业现代化的道路。我们要在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，创造出我国农业现代化系统的完整的理论，创造出适合我国国情的半机械化农具和大型农业机器。
        放手发动群众，发展半机械化农具
    如何发展半机械化农具呢？根本的办法是放手发动群众，充分调动各方面的积极因素。一九五八年，毛泽东同志就说过，要从省到县普遍的设立农具研究所，集中一批科学技术人员和农村有经验的铁匠、木匠，搜集各种比较进步的农具加以比较，加以试验，加以改进，试制新式农具。实践证明，充分发挥广大手工业合作组织的力量，与农民群众紧密结合，贯彻自力更生的革命精神，是多快好省地发展半机械化农具的正确道路。
    根据目前的实际情况，我国幅员广阔，地形和气候复杂，农作物的品种繁多，要使半机械化农具在全国复种面积二十多亿亩的土地上，充分满足耕耘、播种、中耕、施肥、排灌、植保、收割、运输、脱粒、加工、农田基本建设及林、牧、副、渔等等不同作业的需要，而且适应我国东南西北，水田旱地，平原丘陵等不同地区、不同土壤、不同作物和不同耕作制度，是一项极其艰巨、复杂的任务。我国农业早有精耕细作的优良传统，需要农具的品种是很多的，数量也是极大的。仅仅指望现有的现代化的农业机械厂来生产，是不能适应需要的；而依靠国家在短时期内大量投资建设新的农业机械厂，不仅不尽合理，也是不现实的。
    手工业厂、社生产农具的企业有二万五千多个，专业生产农具的职工、社员有八十一万多人，这些企业遍布全国城镇和农村。我国手工业实现合作化以后，技术水平有了很大提高。目前，全国手工业厂、社机械化程度已达到百分之二十五左右。大多数省、专、市的铁木行业和一部分县城的重点农具厂、社，已经基本实现了半机械化、机械化生产。由此可见，手工业厂、社是制造半机械化农具的一支重要力量，也是服务上门，修理农具，传授技术，工业支援农业战线上的前哨部队。发挥手工业灵活性大、适应性强的特点，更好地同农民结合，根据农业生产的需要，创制、仿制出大量的、多种多样的半机械化农具，对促进农业生产和推行农业技术改革，有着重大意义。
    手工业厂、社历来生产中、小农具，与农民关系密切，熟悉农村情况，在旧式农具的基础上进行改革，更能符合农民要求。例如，封闭式水车、解放式水车、深耕犁、新式步犁、畜力圆盘耙、播种机，等等，都是在旧式农具的基础上，是在保存我国手工业优良传统工艺的基础上的提高和发展的。因此，改得快，改得多，推广起来容易，在群众中生根立足，受到广大农民的欢迎。
    手工业厂、社分布面广，生产经营方式比较灵活，能够根据各地的农事季节、作物品种、耕作方法等情况，及时研究制造各种不同类型的半机械化农具，适应农业生产的需要。这样，既便于就地取材、就地制造，又便于就地销售、就地修理。例如，山西、河南、河北等地手工业厂、社，根据当地一九六五年夏季以来干旱比较严重的情况，及时创制、仿制和修理了大量的水锤泵、打井机、动力水车等半机械化提水工具，为抗旱抢种小麦作出了出色的贡献。各省市手工业厂、社针对当地夏收和三秋农忙季节劳动力紧张的情况，制造了大量收割机、脱粒机和铡草机供应当地社队。仅江苏省苏州专区，去年上半年就生产和推广了二千六百余台稻、麦两用脱粒机，不仅提高了工效，节省了劳力，还解决了新稻谷品种脱粒困难的问题。
    手工业厂、社有勤俭经营的优良传统，管理费用较少，善于利用边角废料，生产的半机械化农具成本较低，能适应农村生产队的购买力水平。目前，各地手工业厂、社生产的各种脱粒机，每台价格一般是百元左右，最少的只有十几元。北京市房山县顾册铁业社生产的小型电力碾米机，每小时碾米四百五十斤，每部出厂价六十元，价廉物美，很适合生产队购买使用。
    半机械化农具结构比较简单，加工要求不很精密，在原材料使用上也不象大型农业机械要求那么严格，适合目前手工业厂、社的技术条件。依靠手工业的力量把半机械化农具和改良农具的主要任务承担起来，能够节约国家大量资金，可以使国家腾出力量来较多地发展大型机械化农具。同时，手工业厂、社与农民群众结合，创造出适合农业不同需要的半机械化农具以后，国家就可以在群众创造的基础上，加以研究提高，制造出中国式的、高效率的机械化农具。这样，可以做到普及与提高相结合，有利于加速实现我国的农业机械化。山西省晋东南地区手工业厂、社支援农业的流动服务队，是手工业为农业服务的好形式。它带上碾米机、磨面机、铡草机、脱粒机和修理工具，串村游乡，为生产队和农民群众碾米、磨面、铡草、脱粒和修理农机具，把方便送给农民，把技术送给农村，有力地促进了农业生产，受到农民的普遍欢迎。农民说：“山区有了小机器，碾米磨面不生气，感谢工人老大哥，多亏党和毛主席。”同时，由于流动服务队宣传、示范、推广的结果，一九六五年以来，先后在全专区手工业部门选型和定型了胶石碾米机、离心磨粉机、饲料粉碎机、铡草机、打井机、喷雾器等九种产品，并且根据农民的意见，改进了产品的设计，提高了质量。
    发展半机械化农具要同生产中、小农具相结合
    目前，绝大部分的半机械化农具是全国各地手工业厂、社在旧式农具的基础上，改制和发展起来的。据山西、福建等十九个省市的初步统计，一九六五年一到九月，生产了改良农具和半机械化农具一百余种，共一百三十多万件，约占这些地区全部改良农具和半机械化农具总数的百分之八十左右。但是，也应当看到，目前，半机械化农具在品种和数量上，还远远不能适应农业生产发展的需要，在地区之间发展也不平衡。我们需要认真总结经验，提高认识，增强信心，促进半机械化农具的进一步发展。在工作过程中，要坚持从实际出发，因地制宜，讲究实效；要坚持走群众路线，与农村社队密切结合，树立样板厂、社，建立试验点，通过农民群众的使用鉴定，逐步推广。
    还应当看到，根据我国的实际情况，中、小农具在相当长时期内仍然是农业生产上不可缺少的工具，不能因为要积极发展半机械化农具，就放松中、小农具的生产。一定要在保证中、小农具充分供应的基础上发展半机械化农具。还要特别注意广泛组织力量，传授技术，解决农业机具的修理问题。应当根据集中与分散结合，骨干与一般结合，专业与副业结合，制造与修理结合的原则，进行具体规划。一般地说，应当采取多种多样的组织形式与经营方式，以充分发挥手工业厂、社灵活机动的生产经营特色。
    工业支援农业是一项重大的战略任务，也是整个国民经济中带有根本性的大问题。我们必须进一步提高思想认识，明确生产方向，面向农村，全心全意为农业生产服务，把支援农业的工作向前推进一步。
