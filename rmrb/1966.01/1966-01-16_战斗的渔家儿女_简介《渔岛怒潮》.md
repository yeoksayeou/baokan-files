　　A certain island in the Yellow Sea (called Dragon King Island in the novel) was liberated in 1945. However, the fleeing fishing tyrant, unwilling to accept defeat, colluded with bandits and special agents in 1947 and sneaked back onto Dragon King Island. From then on, the masses on the island launched a series of organized struggles against the enemy. Wang Sijiang, the chairman of the Fishermen's Rescue Association, and his grandson, Hai Sheng, who served as the head of the Children's Corps, as well as Tie Dan, the deputy head of the Children's Corps, were unable to evacuate in time during the transfer and fell into the hands of the enemy. They remained steadfast and unyielding, demonstrating fearless heroism and noble class qualities in the face of the enemy. Despite the enemy's brutality and treachery, the masses' fighting spirit grew stronger and stronger. Finally, under the leadership of the Party, they shattered the enemy's conspiracy and annihilated the counter-revolutionary armed forces, enabling Dragon King Island to regain its liberation. The fishermen and children also grew up in the struggle.

　　The old fisherman, Wang Sijiang, is resolute and firm, truly an old general who "dares to capture dragons from the sea." Hai Sheng and Tie Dan are both fishermen's descendants who have been tempered and can withstand the storms. The work focuses on portraying these three characters. The whole book has a strong storyline, the seaside scenery is also relatively distinct, and it has certain characteristics.

    战斗的渔家儿女
    ——简介《渔岛怒潮》
    一九四五年黄海里的一个岛屿（小说中称它为龙王岛）解放了。可是，逃亡的渔霸不甘心失败，在一九四七年又与匪特里应外合窜回龙王岛。从此，岛上群众有组织地和敌人展开了一系列的斗争。渔救会长王四江和他的担任儿童团团长的孙子海生，以及儿童团副团长铁蛋，由于转移时来不及撤走，以致落入敌人手中。他们始终坚贞不屈，在敌人面前表现了大无畏的英雄气概与崇高的阶级品质。尽管敌人残暴，刁恶，群众的斗志却越来越旺盛；终于在党的领导下，粉碎了敌人的阴谋，歼灭了反革命武装，使龙王岛重获解放。渔家儿女也在斗争生活中锻炼成长起来。
    老渔民王四江刚毅、坚定，真个是“下海敢擒蛟”的老将；海生和铁蛋都是经过锤炼、经得起风浪的渔家后代。作品着力刻划了这三个人物，全书故事性较强，海滨风貌也较为鲜明，具有一定的特色。
