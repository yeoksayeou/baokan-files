    Mao Zedong Thought shines on Daqing, and oil gushes into rivers; Mao Zedong Thought shines on Dazhai, and barren mountains become granaries; Mao Zedong Thought shines on the hearts of children, and revolutionary seeds sprout and take root.
    The New Year has arrived. This is the first spring of our great motherland's Third Five-Year Plan. The people of the whole country are joyfully welcoming this fighting spring. Recalling the past year and looking forward to the future, how exciting our mood is!
    I work as a homeroom teacher for the first grade of junior high school at Beijing No. 4 Middle School. Last year, under the Party's kind and patient education, combined with the situation of class struggle at home and abroad, I studied Chairman Mao's educational thought, which made me deeply understand the strategic significance of educational work. It is closely linked to the cultivation and training of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and to the struggle between imperialism and revisionism for young people and the Chinese revolution and the world revolution! With the meaning of work clarified, I resolved to implement Chairman Mao's educational thought according to the Party's instructions, so that students understand the principle of studying for the revolution. I thought that only by educating students to establish the idea of studying for the revolution can a lively, vigorous, and proactive learning situation emerge.
    The children have just entered middle school, and they are not clear about the purpose of learning and are very playful. I guided them to study Chairman Mao's "Serve the People," and to study with the question of "why do people live?" in mind. See what Chairman Mao said, what he did, and then think about how to do it according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Through study, the thinking of many children has changed.
    Without understanding what exploitation is, and without understanding what oppression is, one cannot understand revolution. In order to make the children establish the idea of studying for the revolution, I tried to organize some class education activities, taking them to factories to visit veteran workers. The veteran workers held their indentures and denounced the crimes of the exploiting classes in the old society to the children. Then I inspired the children to recall the class and national suffering suffered by the older generation. At a class meeting, a child sobbed as he told everyone about his family history. Finally, he excitedly said: "There are still many working people in the world who are living a life worse than cattle and horses, just like my grandfather and father before liberation. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, study hard, and prepare to contribute all my strength to the liberation of all mankind in the future!" These children were born in the new society, grew up under the five-star red flag, and grew up in honey pots. They have only heard gunshots in movies and seen imperialism in picture books, so their understanding of the reactionary nature of imperialism is not enough, and there is a peaceful paralysis of thought. I organized some war preparedness education activities for them: talking about the complex situation of international class struggle, talking about the crimes of imperialism killing and arson everywhere, talking about the suffering of two-thirds of the people in the world; and also guiding them to study Chairman Mao's theory on classes and class struggle, so that they realize that the reactionary nature of imperialism will not change. This further stimulated the children's idea of studying for the revolution.
    Mao Zedong Thought shines on Daqing, and oil gushes into rivers; Mao Zedong Thought shines on Dazhai, and barren mountains become granaries; Mao Zedong Thought shines on the hearts of children, and revolutionary seeds sprout and take root. The children have studied Chairman Mao's works, initially clarified the idea of studying for the revolution, and a lively, vigorous, and proactive learning situation has begun to emerge.
    The children's minds have been liberated and they have begun to get rid of the constraints of grades. They said: they must be responsible to the Party and the people, and study for the revolution. One child wrote in his diary: "Imperialism and revisionism want to play tricks on us, bah! Ten million are impossible! I want to make revolution from a young age, and make revolution for a lifetime."
    The healthy growth of children is the happiness of teachers. But my thoughts and work, as well as the growth of students, still have many problems and have not yet reached the Party's requirements. In this new year, I must highlight politics, study Chairman Mao's works hard, work hard on the word "use," diligently guard the proletarian ideological front, and enable students to achieve more lively, vigorous, and proactive development in all aspects of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.

### 毛泽东思想照亮了孩子的心

    毛泽东思想照亮了孩子的心
    毛泽东思想照到大庆，石油滚滚流成河；毛泽东思想照到大寨，穷山变成米粮山；毛泽东思想照到孩子们的心，一颗颗革命的种子在发芽生根。
    新春来到了。这是我们伟大祖国第三个五年计划的第一个春天。全国人民正在欢欣鼓舞地迎接这战斗的春天。回想过去的一年，又展望将来，心情是多么激动啊！
    我在北京四中担任初中一年级班主任的工作。去年，在党的亲切、耐心教育下，结合国内外阶级斗争形势，学习了毛主席的教育思想，使我深深地懂得了教育工作的战略意义。它，与培养、造就无产阶级革命事业接班人，与帝国主义、修正主义争夺青少年与中国革命和世界革命紧紧地挂着钩哩！工作意义明确了，我就决心按照党的指示，贯彻毛主席的教育思想，让学生懂得为革命而学习的道理。我想，只有教育学生树立起为革命而学的思想，才会出现生动、活泼、主动地学习的局面。
    孩子们刚刚升入中学，对学习目的不明确，很贪玩。我就引导他们学习毛主席的《为人民服务》，带着“人为什么活着”这个问题去学。看看毛主席是怎么说的，自己又是怎么做的，再想想怎样按毛主席的指示去做。通过学习，很多孩子的思想发生了变化。
    不懂得什么是剥削，不懂得什么是压迫，就不懂得革命。为了使孩子们树立起为革命而学的思想，我就想办法组织一些阶级教育的活动，带他们去工厂访问老工人，老工人拿着自己的卖身契向孩子们控诉旧社会剥削阶级的罪恶。接着我就启发孩子们回忆上代人身受的阶级苦、民族苦。在一次班会上，一个孩子泣不成声地向大家哭诉家史。最后，他激动地说：“世界上还有很多劳动人民，还过着象我爷爷、爸爸在解放前一样的牛马不如的生活。我一定听毛主席的话，好好学习，准备将来为解放全人类贡献一切力量！”这些孩子生在新社会，长在五星红旗下，在蜜罐罐里长大。他们只是在电影里听到过枪声，在小人书里看见过帝国主义，因此对帝国主义的反动本性认识不够，存在着和平麻痹思想。我就为他们组织一些备战教育活动：讲国际上阶级斗争的复杂形势，讲帝国主义到处杀人放火的罪行，讲世界上三分之二人民受苦受难的状况；还引导他们学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的理论，让他们认识到帝国主义的反动本性是不会改变的。这就更激发了孩子们为革命而学的思想。
    毛泽东思想照到大庆，石油滚滚流成河；毛泽东思想照到大寨，穷山变成米粮山；毛泽东思想照到孩子们的心，一颗颗革命的种子在发芽生根。孩子们学习了毛主席著作，初步明确了为革命而学的思想，一个生动、活泼、主动地学习的局面开始出现了。
    孩子们的思想解放了，开始摆脱分数的束缚。他们表示：要对党、对人民负责，为革命而学。一个孩子在日记中这样写道：“帝国主义、修正主义想在我们身上打主意，呸！十万个办不到！我要从小干革命，一辈子干革命。”
    孩子们健康地成长，就是教师的幸福。但我的思想和工作，以及学生的成长，都还存在着不少问题，还没有达到党的要求。在这新的一年里，我一定要突出政治，努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，勤勤恳恳地坚守无产阶级思想阵地，使学生在德智体诸方面都能得到更加生动、活泼、主动的发展。
