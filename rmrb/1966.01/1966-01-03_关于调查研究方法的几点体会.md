    Some Experiences with Investigation and Research Methods
    Liu Linyuan
    It often happens that some comrades go deep into reality to conduct investigations and research, and they are subjectively very diligent. They put in a lot of effort and endured a lot of hardship, but they just can't find out what's going on. What they produce often doesn't reflect the objective reality. What is the reason for this?
    I think the problem of investigation and research methods is one of the reasons.
    Subjectivist and metaphysical methods in investigation and research are wrong, and the materialist dialectic is correct. However, not all comrades have solved this problem in actual work. This is especially true for us young students who lack practical work experience. Based on my own experience of suffering from metaphysical mistakes and tasting the sweetness of materialist dialectics guiding my work, I would like to share a few insights.
      Don't Bring Preconceived Notions, Start Everything from Reality
    Investigation and research are for understanding the objective reality and finding its laws to guide our actions. Investigation and research must adhere to the principle of starting from reality from beginning to end, without bringing preconceived notions.
    Preconceived notions are subjectivist things. They are not a reflection of objective things, but fabrications in people's minds. Preconceived notions are also metaphysical things, because objective things are developing and changing, while preconceived notions are said to be permanent and universally applicable. Going down to understand the situation and conduct investigations and research with preconceived notions will never lead to detailed possession of materials, through analysis and research, to draw correct conclusions from the materials, as Chairman Mao taught us. Instead, it will inevitably lead to subjectively imposing one's views on objective reality, subjectively and one-sidedly gathering some phenomena of things to fill in pre-designed frameworks. This kind of investigation and research, which is subjectivism plus metaphysics, will inevitably result in being blinded by a single leaf, unable to see Mount Tai, stuffing one's ears with beans, unable to hear thunder, listening to only one side, and taking what one needs. The result of "investigation and research," apart from carrying back a basket of pieced-together materials, is the distortion of objective things and wrong conclusions.
    Investigation and research must start from reality and not bring preconceived notions. But this does not mean that we should not study the Party's policies and guidelines before investigation and research, or learn from successful experiences from other places, or have clear goals or preliminary views. The Party's policies and guidelines must be carefully studied, as they are the ideological guidance for our work. However, the Party's policies and guidelines are suitable for the general situation of the country. To implement them concretely in our area, we must start from reality, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and find concrete working methods. Successful experiences from other places should also be carefully studied, but the correct method should be adopted for learning. Contradictions have their particularity and different concrete manifestations. Therefore, learning from successful experiences from other places does not mean memorizing certain concrete materials and ready-made conclusions and using them as preconceived notions everywhere. Instead, it means learning their stand, viewpoint, and method of discovering, analyzing, and solving contradictions. Before investigation and research, there will always be some goals or preliminary opinions. However, we should constantly test our original views in the process of actual investigation and research, or supplement and enrich them, or revise and even fundamentally overthrow them, instead of using them as preconceived notions to impose on objective reality.
    The generation of preconceived notions is sometimes a problem of understanding methods, and sometimes a problem of attitude. Some people have individualistic emotions. For personal purposes, they go down with preconceived notions to collect materials and conduct investigations to find evidence for their views in order to achieve individualistic goals. This is a problem of attitude. However, in our revolutionary ranks, more of it belongs to the problem of understanding methods. Some people have preconceived notions because they regard their own experience or the experience of others as sacred and unchanging things; or because they regard books as preconceived notions, and they do whatever the books say. These are the two roots of preconceived notions. The former belongs to empiricism, and the latter belongs to dogmatism. Intellectuals are easily trapped by books, theory is divorced from reality, and they like to mechanically apply dead rules. Because they are young and lack practical work experience, they are also easily trapped by the experience of others, accepting the experience of others without analysis.
        Everything Must Be "Divided into Two"
    Investigation and research are for understanding objective things. Objective things are inherently divided into two. Therefore, we must also use the method of dividing into two to observe things and analyze things in order to correctly reflect the true situation of objective things. At present, there are still classes and class struggles in our society. Rural grassroots cadres are affected differently in the current class struggle and have different performances. Due to different class positions, different levels of awareness, and different methods of understanding, the masses will also have various reactions to cadres. Some of them are correct, some are not entirely correct, and some are even wrong. In the process of investigation and research, we will come into contact with these different phenomena and different opinions. We must listen to them carefully, think about them, and make objective analysis in order to have a comprehensive understanding of objective things. Otherwise, we will make the mistake of one-sidedness and mess things up.
    When I was working in the countryside, the commune members had various reactions to a production team leader. At that time, when we heard the masses report that he had a series of shortcomings and mistakes, we thought the problem must be serious. When we heard someone say that the team leader was good, we turned a deaf ear and didn't even think about it. Under the guidance of this "serious problem" thinking, I lacked active enthusiasm for him. As a result, things became difficult to handle. I still thought in my heart that my class viewpoint was very clear, and he must have a ghost!
    Did he have a ghost, or did I not treat him by dividing into two? The analysis showed that I did not treat him by dividing into two. I only saw his problems and did not see his achievements and advantages. Of course, he was not convinced.
    We used the viewpoint of dividing into two to re-understand this team leader. He came from a poor peasant family. Three generations of his ancestors had to beg for food. His father starved to death in the old society. He joined the People's Liberation Army in 1948, went to the Korean front, and was awarded the third-class merit twice. He joined the Party. During the period of people's communes and the Great Leap Forward, he always walked in the forefront, working hard and enduring hardship. After he became the production team leader in 1961, he was always active in labor and never cared about work points. He loved the collective. In the winter of 1963, he went to Yizheng to buy cattle for the team. He could have taken a car back with the cattle, but in order to save the team 40 yuan, he led the cattle on foot for five days. Along the way, he was afraid that the cattle would freeze. In the freezing weather, he took off his cotton coat and put it on the back of the cattle. During the Socialist Education Movement, when a cow in the production team gave birth to a calf, he stayed up all night to take care of it carefully in the cowshed. However, due to his low cultural level, his working methods were a bit simple, which offended some people. Comparing his achievements and shortcomings, achievements are the main thing. After this analysis, my eyes suddenly became much brighter. He is basically a good cadre, our class brother, and we should enthusiastically help him with his shortcomings and mistakes. With this understanding, my attitude towards him also changed. First, I affirmed his achievements and advantages, and also seriously pointed out his problems, asking him to strictly demand himself according to the standards of a communist, consciously make revolution, and enthusiastically help him solve some concrete difficulties. He became more active, took the initiative to do a good job in production, and was determined to make revolution consciously.
    I deeply realized that it is too important to observe and analyze things by dividing into two! Without dividing into two, we cannot understand objective things comprehensively and correctly, and we will make subjective and one-sided mistakes, which will bring losses to our work. The Marxist class analysis method is to conduct a comprehensive and historical analysis of a certain class or a certain person according to the class viewpoint of the proletariat. For this production team leader, it means seeing his class origin, his performance in past class struggles, and his performance in the current class struggle, with the current performance as the main thing. We must see the good aspects and also see his shortcomings and mistakes, and find out the basic aspects from these two aspects to determine his class essence. For his shortcomings and mistakes, we must analyze both subjective reasons and objective reasons; we must distinguish between class roots and cognitive roots, rather than attributing everything to poor ideological awareness. The dialectical analysis method of dividing into two applied to social and historical phenomena is the class analysis method. Leaving aside the class analysis of dividing into two will inevitably lead to one-sided and wrong conclusions. Only by adhering to dividing into two and conducting concrete class analysis of concrete people in the process of investigation and research can we correctly understand the objective reality and do a good job.
          Firmly Grasp the Principal Contradiction
    When we squatted in a production team, we found that the team's production was not ideal and lagged behind other production teams. What is the reason for this? We wanted to find out the reason.
    According to preliminary understanding, there are several reasons why the team's production is not good: some land is of poor quality, fertilizer is insufficient, the attendance rate is not high, and production funds are not sufficient. In addition, the team also has a "team-run" sideline—a paper mill. But which of these factors is the main factor? Where is the principal contradiction affecting production?
    We originally thought it was a problem of soil quality and fertilizer. But compared with other teams, this team has more land. In addition to the land with poor soil quality, the average number of people per person is more than other teams. Fertilizer should not be a problem either. The manure of five cows, the collective also raises more than 20 pigs, and the commune members also raise pigs. In addition to pig manure and human manure, there are also two mud boats that can dig mud, plus chemical fertilizers supplied by the state. All these fertilizers are not a few! So what is the problem? What caused the low attendance rate?
    Where exactly is the key, I couldn't find it for a while. Later, a joint meeting of the Poor Peasants Association, the team committee, activists, and old farmers was held specifically for production. At the meeting, a member of the Poor Peasants Association said: "If the paper mill is not closed, production will be difficult to do well!" Everyone who attended the meeting had this view. This reminded me that after analyzing with the masses, it was determined that the paper mill was the key to the team's poor production. Because the direction and road of running the factory were not right, the paper mill inappropriately occupied 30% to 40% of the production team's labor force. Commune members with skills went out, worrying that collective agricultural production would not be done well, or they went out to work to earn some money to live on. The commune members who work at home are also a bit discouraged. In this way, how can production be done well? Not only that, the paper mill also drew collective production funds, which directly affected agricultural production. After this analysis, the main contradiction was grasped. If this contradiction is not resolved, agricultural production will not be done well. If production is not done well, other contradictions cannot be resolved either. Facts have proved that this move was correct. After the paper mill was closed, we conducted education on farming for revolution and farming with revolutionary spirit to the commune members, coupled with other organizational measures, the attendance rate quickly rose to 95% or even 100%, fertilizer can be applied to the fields in time, and the commune members have a high enthusiasm for production. This year's wheat harvest, the average yield of the three wheat crops per mu increased by more than 70% compared with last year.
    We deeply realized that to correctly understand objective things in investigation and research, we must possess rich perceptual materials and grasp the essence of things through phenomena. The essence of things is determined by the principal contradiction, especially the main aspect of the principal contradiction. Therefore, we must strive to capture the principal contradiction of things in investigation and research. Investigation and research are for solving the principal contradiction. Only by firmly grasping the principal contradiction and solving it can other contradictions be solved easily. Therefore, the process of investigation and research is actually the process of capturing the principal contradiction.
          Constantly and Repeatedly Investigate and Research
    The essence of things is invisible and intangible. It is hidden behind the phenomena. We cannot capture it by contacting it once or twice. This is especially true for some more complex things. We must conduct multiple investigations and research repeatedly in order to understand the true situation of it.
    A member of the Poor Peasants Association who came from a lower-middle peasant family. Through understanding and contact with him, we felt that this person was very active in labor and could actively participate in social activities, giving us a good impression. But after a period of time, the number of times we contacted him increased, the time became longer, and we learned more. I felt that this person was selfish and wanted a subsidy for food. After another period of time, I had a more comprehensive understanding of him. His essence is good. He actively participates in the movement, dares to fight against bad people and bad things, and cares about the collective, but he also has individualistic thoughts. However, there are objective reasons for wanting to subsidize food, because both he and his wife are strong laborers and have no children. We don't understand the situation. We didn't care about his life. He raised his difficulties. How can this be called selfish?
    The recognition of a person is like this. The recognition of a complex thing or social phenomenon cannot be completed by one investigation and research. Because objective things are constantly developing and changing, if things develop and change, we cannot stick to the old set, but must return to reality and conduct investigation and research on the changed things to obtain new understanding. Therefore, after one investigation and research, we cannot think that all problems have been solved once and for all, but must constantly and repeatedly investigate.
    It is common in daily life that subjective lags behind the objective situation. The objective situation has changed, but people's understanding has not changed and cannot keep up with the development of the situation. On the one hand, this is due to the limitations of various objective conditions, and people's understanding cannot keep up with the development of the situation. But under normal circumstances, it is because people are lazy to conduct frequent and repeated investigations and research on the objective situation, sticking to the old set and handling affairs based on old experience. In this way, there is no way to avoid making mistakes in understanding.
              ＊　＊　＊
    Correct methods are important for investigation and research, but methods require people to master and use. If there is no correct attitude towards investigation and research, even the best methods cannot achieve the desired results. Chairman Mao said: "Without full enthusiasm, without the determination to keep our eyes downward, without the thirst for knowledge, and without putting aside airs and willingly becoming a pupil, it is absolutely impossible to do well." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume III, page 790) We should have the correct attitude of putting aside airs, willingly becoming a pupil, being humble, and being down-to-earth. With the correct attitude and mastering the methods of investigation and research, we can truly do a good job of investigation and research.

    关于调查研究方法的几点体会
    刘林元
    往往有这样的情况：有的同志深入实际进行调查研究，主观上也很努力，出了不少力，吃了不少苦，就是调查不出名堂来，搞出来的东西往往不能反映客观实际情况。这是什么原因呢？
    我觉得调查研究的方法问题，是其中的原因之一。
    调查研究中的主观主义和形而上学的方法是错误的，唯物辩证法是正确的。但是在实际工作中，并不是所有的同志都解决了这个问题。对我们这些缺乏实际工作的青年学生来说，更是如此。现就自己在实际工作中吃过形而上学的苦头，尝过唯物辩证法指导工作的甜头，谈几点体会。
      不带框框，一切从实际出发
    调查研究是为了认识客观实际情况，找出它的规律，来指导我们的行动。调查研究必须自始至终坚持从实际出发的原则，不带框框。
    框框是主观主义的东西，它不是客观事物的反映，而是人们头脑中虚构出来的。框框又是形而上学的东西，因为客观事物是发展变化的，而框框据说是永久不变的，到处可用的。带着框框下去了解情况、调查研究，决不会象主席教导我们的那样，详细地占有材料，通过分析研究，从材料中引出正确的结论，而必然是主观套客观，主观地、片面地搜罗一些事物的现象，去填充预先设计好的框框。这种主观主义加形而上学的调查研究，必然是一叶障目，不见泰山，两耳塞豆，不闻巨雷，偏听偏信，取其所需。“调查研究”的结果，除了背了一筐东拚西凑的材料回来，剩下的就是对客观事物的歪曲和错误的结论。
    调查研究一定要从实际出发，不带框框。但并不是在调查研究之先就不要学习党的方针政策，不要学习外地成功的经验，不要有明确的目的或初步看法。党的方针政策必须认真学习，它是我们工作的思想指导。但是，党的方针政策适合于全国一般情况，而要在本地区具体贯彻，必须从实际出发，深入调查研究，找到具体的工作方法。外地的成功经验也要认真学习，但学习要采取正确的方法。矛盾有它的特殊性，具体表现不同，因此，学习外地成功的经验，不是去记取某些具体材料和现成结论，把它当作框框来到处搬用，而是学习他们发现矛盾、分析矛盾和解决矛盾的立场、观点和方法。调查研究之先，总会有某种目的或初步意见。但是，我们应该在实际调查研究过程中，不断检验原有的看法，或者加以补充、丰富，或者修正以至根本推翻它，而不是把它作为框框来套客观现实。
    框框的产生，有的是认识方法上的问题，也有的是态度问题。有的人有个人主义情绪，为了个人的目的，带着框框下去收集材料，搞调查，为他的观点找证据，以达到个人主义的目的，这就是态度问题。但在我们革命队伍中，更多的是属于认识方法上的问题。有的人之所以有框框，是由于他们把自己的经验或者别人的经验捧若神明，视为永久不变的东西；或是由于他们把书本当成框框，书本怎么说他就怎么干。这是框框产生的两个根源。前者属经验主义，后者属教条主义。知识分子很容易被书本框住，理论脱离实际，好搬死教条。又因为年轻，缺乏实际工作经验，也容易为别人的经验框住，对别人的经验不加分析，全盘接受。
        凡事都要“一分为二”
    调查研究是为了认识客观事物。客观事物本来是一分为二的，所以我们也必须用一分为二的方法来观察事物、分析事物，才能正确地反映客观事物的真实情况。当前我国社会还存在阶级和阶级斗争，农村基层干部在当前阶级斗争中受到不同的影响，有不同的表现。群众中由于阶级立场不同，觉悟水平不同，认识方法不同，所以对干部也会有各种各样的反映。其中有的是正确的，有的不完全正确，甚至是错误的。在调查研究过程中，我们就会接触到这些不同的现象，不同的言论，我们都必须好好听一听，想一想，作客观的分析，才能对客观事物取得全面的认识，否则就会犯片面性的错误，把事情搞坏。
    我在农村工作时，社员群众对一个生产队的队长有各种反映。当时，我们听到群众反映他有一系列缺点和错误，就认为问题一定严重；听到有人说队长是好的，就充耳不闻，根本不去考虑。在这种“问题严重”的思想指导下，我就对他缺少积极热情。这样一来，事情反倒不好办。我心里还以为自己的阶级观点很明确，一定是他有鬼！
    是他有鬼还是我没有对他一分为二呢？分析结果，是我没有一分为二对待他，只看到他的问题，而没有看到他的成绩、优点，他当然不服。
    我们又用一分为二的观点重新认识了这一个队长。他贫农出身，祖辈三代要过饭，父亲是在旧社会饿死的。本人一九四八年参加解放军，到过朝鲜前线，立过二次三等功，入了党。在人民公社化和大跃进时期，他一直走在前头，吃苦耐劳。一九六一年任生产队长之后，一贯劳动积极，从不计较工分。他爱护集体。一九六三年冬他去仪征为队里买牛，本来可以连人搭牛乘汽车回来，但为了给队里节约四十元钱，牵牛徒步走了五天，一路上怕牛挨冻，在滴水成冰的数九寒天，脱下自己的棉大衣披在牛背上。社教运动中，生产队母牛下了小牛，他彻夜不眠，守在牛棚里细心照料。但由于文化水平低，工作方法有些简单，得罪了一些人。把他的成绩和缺点比，成绩是主要的。经过这一次分析，眼睛一下亮了许多。他基本上是个好干部，是我们的阶级弟兄，有缺点错误，应该热情帮助他。有了这样的认识，我对他的态度也随之转变了。首先肯定了他的成绩和优点，也严肃地指出他的问题，要他以共产党员标准严格要求自己，自觉革命，并且热情地帮助他解决了一些具体困难。他更加积极起来，主动搞好生产，自觉革命决心也很大。
    我深深体会到用一分为二观察事物和分析事物太重要了！离开一分为二，就不能全面地、正确地认识客观事物，就会犯主观性、片面性的错误，给工作带来损失。马克思主义的阶级分析法就是按照无产阶级的阶级观点，对一定的阶级、一定的人进行全面的、历史的分析。对这个生产队长来说，也就是既看到他的阶级出身，在过去阶级斗争中的表现，也看到他在当前阶级斗争中的表现，并以当前的表现为主。既看到好的方面，又要看到他的缺点错误，从这两方面中找出基本方面，确定他的阶级本质。对于他的缺点错误，既要分析主观原因，又要分析客观原因；既要分清阶级根源，又要分清认识根源，而不是一概归于思想意识的不好。一分为二的辩证分析法运用于社会历史现象，就是阶级分析法。离开一分为二的阶级分析，必然得出片面的错误结论。只有在调查研究过程中，坚持一分为二，对具体的人进行具体的阶级分析，才能正确认识客观实际情况，做好工作。
          紧紧抓住主要矛盾
    我们在一个生产队蹲点，发现这个队的生产不够理想，比别的生产队落后。究竟是什么道理呢？我们想把原因找出来。
    根据初步了解，队里生产搞得不好有以下几个原因：一部分土地土质不好，肥料不足，出勤率不高，生产资金不充裕。另外，队里还有个“队办”副业——纸厂。但这些因素中，哪个是主要因素呢？影响生产的主要矛盾在哪里？
    我们原先以为是土质和肥料的问题。但是跟别的队一比，这个队土地多，除了土质差的以外，每人平均数还比别队多。肥料应该也不成问题，五条牛的牛粪，集体还养了二十多头猪，社员家还养猪。猪粪人粪之外还有两只泥船可扒泥，加上国家供应的化肥，这些肥料全用上并不少啊！那么是什么问题呢？出勤率不高是什么原因造成的呢？
    关键究竟在哪里，一时找不出来。后来，专为生产开了个贫协、队委、积极分子和老农联席会议。会上一个贫协委员说：“纸厂不关门，生产就难搞好！”到会的人都有这样的看法。这下提醒了我，经过与群众一起分析，认定纸厂是队里生产搞不好的关键。因为办厂的方向道路不对头，纸厂不恰当地占用了生产队百分之三十——百分之四十的劳力。有手艺的社员出去了，他们担心集体农业生产搞不好，还是自己出去做工，赚几个钱过日子。在家劳动的社员也有点泄气。这样，生产怎么能搞好呢？不仅如此，纸厂还抽调了集体生产资金，直接影响了农业生产。经过这一分析，主要矛盾抓住了。这个矛盾不解决，农业生产就搞不好。生产搞不好，其他矛盾也解决不了。事实证明了这一着抓得对。纸厂停办以后，我们对社员进行了种田为革命、以革命精神种田的教育，加上其他组织措施，出勤率就迅速上升到百分之九十五甚至百分之一百，肥料也能及时下田，社员们的生产劲头很高。今年麦收，三麦平均亩产较去年增产七成以上。
    我们深深体会到，调查研究要正确认识客观事物，就要占有丰富的感性材料，透过现象掌握事物的本质。而事物的本质是由主要矛盾，特别是主要矛盾的主要方面所规定的。所以，调查研究中一定要努力捕捉事物的主要矛盾。调查研究就是为了解决主要矛盾的。只有紧紧抓住主要矛盾，解决了它，其他矛盾才会迎刃而解。所以调查研究的过程，实际上就是捕捉主要矛盾的过程。
          不断反复地调查研究
    事物的本质是看不见摸不着的，它藏在现象的后面，光靠我们对它一次两次的接触，是捉不住它的。特别是一些比较复杂的事物更是如此，必须反复进行多次调查研究，才能了解到它的真实情况。
    一个下中农出身的贫协委员，我们通过了解和跟他本人接触，觉得这个人劳动很积极，社会活动也能积极参加，给我们一个好印象。可是过了一段时间，跟他接触的次数多了，时间长了，了解得更多了，觉得这个人自私，要补助粮食。又过了一段时间，才对他有了比较全面的认识。他的本质是好的，积极参加运动，敢于与坏人坏事作斗争，关心集体，但他也有个人主义思想。不过，要补助粮是有客观原因的，因为他夫妻两人都是大劳力，又没小孩。我们不了解情况。没有关心他的生活，他把困难提出来了，这怎么叫自私呢？
    对一个人的认识是这样，对一个复杂的事物或者社会现象，更不是一次调查研究所能完成的。因为客观事物是在不断地发展变化的，事物发展了、变化了，我们就不能守着老一套，而必须重新到实际中去，对变化了的事物进行调查研究，取得新的认识。所以，一次调查研究之后，就不能认为一劳永逸地解决了一切问题，而必须不断反复地调查。
    日常生活中常见的有主观落后于客观形势的情况，客观形势变了，而人们的认识还没有变，跟不上形势的发展。这一方面是由于种种客观条件的限制，人们的认识赶不上形势的发展。但在通常情况下，则是由于人们懒于对客观情况作经常地、反复地调查研究，守着老一套，凭着老经验办事。这样，认识上没有不犯错误的。
              ＊　＊　＊
    正确的方法对调查研究是重要的，但方法要人去掌握和运用。假如对调查研究没有正确的态度，再好的方法也不能达到预期的效果。毛主席说：“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”（《毛泽东选集》第三卷，第七九○页）我们应该有放下臭架子、甘当小学生和虚心、踏实的正确态度。有了正确的态度，掌握了调查研究的方法，才能真正把调查研究工作搞好。
