    Never Forget to Participate in Labor
    I was born into a poor peasant family. During my time working in the brigade and commune, I often participated in collective labor. In the second half of 1964, I was transferred to the county party committee to serve as deputy secretary. I consciously used all kinds of gaps to persist in participating in collective productive labor. I did this because I studied the relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and I realized that whether the county party committee and its members, as the fighting "headquarters" leading the people of the whole county in building a new socialist countryside, participate in collective productive labor is a touchstone for testing whether this "headquarters" and each member is truly revolutionized. Chairman Mao taught us: "The system of cadre participation in collective productive labor must be adhered to. The cadres of our party and country are ordinary laborers, not overlords riding on the backs of the people." "Through participation in collective productive labor, cadres maintain the broadest, most regular, and closest ties with the working people. This is a matter of fundamental importance under the socialist system, and it helps to overcome bureaucracy and prevent revisionism and dogmatism." The Party Central Committee's instruction said: "Whether or not one participates in productive labor is a test of whether a Communist Party member can struggle for the party's general task under new historical conditions." How clear are these instructions from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!
    If we cannot regularly participate in collective labor, wouldn't we be forgetting the fundamentals of the laboring people? Wouldn't we become "bureaucratic overlords"? Wouldn't we be preparing the soil for the emergence of revisionism and dogmatism?
    From the practice of participating in labor over the past few years, we have further realized that the primary purpose of cadres participating in labor is to transform their own thinking and establish a revolutionary worldview of serving the vast majority of people in China and the world wholeheartedly. Only with a clear revolutionary ideology can we directly throw ourselves into the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation. Only then can we, in thought and action, live and labor together with the laboring people and become true ordinary laborers. With a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, and living and laboring among the people regularly, we can do what the people do, think what the people think, understand their hardships at all times and in all places, understand their demands, think for them, and be good servants of the people.
    The front line of agricultural production is also the front line of ideological struggle in the countryside. To grasp politics, grasp ideology, and promote production in the struggle to build a new socialist countryside, we must also regularly participate in productive labor. Only by laboring together can we establish and maintain deep class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, understand their true thoughts and demands, integrate with the masses, discover and deal with problems in a timely and concrete manner, do our work well, and at the same time accept the supervision of the masses and eliminate "official airs." Recently, I went deep into Chengxi Commune. While laboring with the commune members, and while telling the commune members the story of Wang Jie, I also discovered local model figures. I then worked with the brigade and team cadres to combine the new people, new events, and new ideas of our own team and commune to carry out political and ideological work among the masses, which achieved good results.

    永远不忘参加劳动
    我出身贫农家庭，在大队和公社工作期间，经常参加集体劳动。一九六四年下半年调到县委担任副书记工作，我有意识地利用各种空隙坚持参加集体生产劳动。这样做，是由于我学习了党中央和毛主席的有关指示，认识到，作为领导全县人民建设社会主义新农村的战斗“司令部”——县委会和它的成员，是否参加集体生产劳动，是考验这个“司令部”和每个成员是不是真正革命化的试金石。毛主席教导说：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”党中央的指示说：“是不是参加生产劳动，是在新的历史条件下，共产党员能否为党的总任务而奋斗的一种考验。”党中央和毛主席的这些指示说得多么清楚！
    如果我们不能经常参加集体劳动，那不是忘了劳动人民的根本吗？那不是成了“官老爷”吗？那不是替产生修正主义和教条主义准备土壤吗？
    从几年来参加劳动的实践中，我们进一步认识到，干部参加劳动的首要目的，就是改造自己的思想，树立全心全意为全中国和全世界绝大多数人服务的革命的世界观。只有有了明确的革命思想，才能直接投身到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大运动中去，才能从思想到行动，同劳动人民生活在一起，劳动在一起，成为一个真正的普通劳动者。有了全心全意为人民服务的世界观，又经常生活和劳动在人民中间，才能够做人民所做，想人民所想，随时随地体会到他们的疾苦，了解到他们的要求，为他们着想，当好人民的勤务员。
    农业生产第一线，也是农村思想斗争的第一线。要在建设社会主义新农村的斗争中，抓政治、抓思想、促生产，也必须经常参加生产劳动。只有在一起劳动中，才能同贫下中农建立和保持深厚的阶级感情，了解他们的真实思想和要求，和群众打成一片，及时地、具体地发现问题、处理问题，做好工作，同时接受群众的监督，打掉“官风”。最近，我深入程溪公社，在和社员同劳动中，在给社员们讲王杰的故事的同时，也发现了当地的模范人物，便同社队干部一起，结合本队、本社的新人、新事、新思想，向群众进行政治思想工作，收到较好的效果。
