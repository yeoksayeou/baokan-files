    Daring to Make the Wind and Sand Bow its Head
    – A Record of Fifteen Years of Afforestation and Sand Control in Fuyu County, Jilin
    The people of Fuyu have engaged in fifteen years of arduous struggle, afforesting more than 200,000 mu, protecting farmland, and fixing drifting sand. Afforesting large areas of sandy wasteland is no easy task, but because they earnestly mobilized and relied on the masses, the sandy wasteland has finally been transformed into an oasis. The changes in Fuyu help people understand more deeply the truth that "the people have unlimited creativity."
    The car travels along a tree-lined highway. In December in the Northeast, water freezes into ice. Although the leaves have long since fallen, looking ahead from the car window, the view is still occasionally blocked by dense branches. On the fields on both sides of the highway, rows of shelterbelts crisscross, protecting one piece of farmland after another. Outside the villages, trees surround them, and rows of fruit trees are planted.
    This is Fuyu County, Jilin Province, famous for its afforestation and sand control.
    Since 1950, this county has afforested more than 260,000 mu, including more than 125,000 mu of farmland shelterbelts, protecting more than 2.25 million mu of farmland. 15,000 mu of sand-fixing forests have been created on mobile sand dunes, and 100,500 mu have been planted with grass to fix drifting sand. In this way, the drifting sand no longer buries houses and cultivated land, and 30,000 mu of farmland that had been abandoned due to wind and sand disasters has been reclaimed. Last year, the county's collective teams' more than 3,700 mu of orchards produced 680,000 jin of fruit.
    Afforestation has brought about tremendous changes in the natural appearance of Fuyu County. According to observations in September 1962, wind speed on the windward side of the shelterbelt, at a distance equivalent to five times the height of the trees, was reduced by 20% compared to areas without shelterbelts; on the leeward side of the shelterbelt, at a distance equivalent to five times the height of the trees, the wind speed was reduced by 69%. The Bodu and other six communes, which established farmland shelterbelts earlier, have seen steady increases in grain production year after year due to the protection of the shelterbelts, coupled with other measures. Fuyu was originally a place lacking timber, but now it can solve a large amount of its own construction timber needs every year. The large sand dunes, where nothing could grow before, have now become "mountains of treasures," where commune members pick mushrooms, dig medicinal herbs, and hunt, increasing their sideline income. They happily call the shelterbelts "grain belts," "treasure belts," and "happiness belts."
    Looking at today's afforestation achievements, the people of Fuyu often recall a different scene from fifteen years ago.
    Fuyu County is located in the northwest of Jilin Province, with a total area of more than 8.31 million mu and a cultivated area of more than 4.08 million mu. It is surrounded by the Songhua River and Lalin River on the south, north, and west sides. Along the river in the western and southern areas, there are continuous large sand dunes, 300 li long, 2 li wide, and covering a total area of more than 170,000 mu. Every year during the windy season, the sand dunes roll northeastward with the wind, burying fertile land and swallowing houses. Large areas of farmland in the county are also often subject to wind and sand damage.
    In 1950, the Fuyu County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the people of the county to establish the ambitious goal of afforestation to control wind and sand. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they were determined, unafraid of sacrifice, and overcame all difficulties to strive for victory. And it was decided to start with the construction of sand-fixing forests and farmland shelterbelts to fight against wind and sand.
    At that time, most of the masses actively supported the proposal of afforestation and windbreak and sand fixation because they had suffered from wind and sand disasters; although some of the masses also urgently demanded a radical cure for wind and sand disasters, they were afraid that afforestation would not work, that planting trees would not survive and would waste labor, that it would affect production, and that it would occupy cultivated land, so they could not make up their minds for a while; and a few people were not active in afforestation and sand fixation. The county party committee believed that the ambition of the leaders must be transformed into the actual actions of the broad masses. Under such circumstances, how can the enthusiasm of a few people be turned into the enthusiasm of the broad masses? Chairman Mao said: "In any place where there are masses, there are roughly three groups of people: the more active, the intermediate, and the more backward. Therefore, leaders must be good at uniting a small number of activists as the backbone of leadership, and rely on this group of backbone to improve the intermediate elements and win over the backward elements." In accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, the Fuyu County Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized afforestation activists to form propaganda teams to widely publicize the great significance and specific policies of afforestation among the masses, and calculated the benefits of afforestation for agricultural production, the harms of no forests, the labor used for afforestation, and the income after afforestation. District by district, village by village. In this way, many people said: If you don't calculate, you don't know; if you calculate, you get a shock. The benefits of afforestation are really not small! While cadres at all levels went deep into the masses to publicize the significance of afforestation, they also worked with poor and lower-middle peasants to demonstrate afforestation. Gradually, those who had concerns dispelled their concerns, those who could not make up their minds made up their minds, and those who were not active became active. A struggle to transform nature began. Every spring and autumn, as many as forty to fifty thousand people participate in afforestation. As a result, Fuyu has appeared with patches of "elderly forests," "youth forests," "women's forests," "children's forests"...
    In this battle, the people of Fuyu County first went outside (planting trees on the sand dunes along the river) and then inside; first built farmland shelterbelts, and then built other forests; step by step from west to east. Over the past fifteen years, they have achieved great results, and many advanced units have emerged, as well as thousands of heroic figures who are not afraid of difficulties, are brave in revolution, and persist in experiments. Tian Fu, the director of the Forestry Farm of the Agricultural and Forestry Brigade of Bodu Commune and a national model worker in forestry, is such a typical figure.
    Tian Fu's old home is in Xiaoxilang River Village near the sand dunes. Forty-three years ago, when Tian Fu was eight years old, the drifting sand forced its way into the village, and all the households in the village were forced to abandon their homes and move north. At that time, poor farmers were powerless to resist wind and sand disasters. After liberation, Tian Fu watched as the drifting sand gradually swallowed up cultivated land, and his heart ached. When the Party called for afforestation, he was moved and began to think about ways to control mobile sand dunes. On windy days, he sat back to the wind on the edge of the sand dunes to observe the movement of the sand dunes. He observed and experimented, and finally planted mountain bamboo and willow branches on the sand dunes. Tian Fu's experiment was supported by the local Party organization and the masses, and it was soon promoted on a large scale. A few years later, all twenty-six sand dunes in this brigade were fixed. Tian Fu often said: "To build good forests, you must always keep your thoughts on the trees." He has indeed done this for the past fifteen years.
    The forest has been built, but the struggle is not over. Building forests for a while, managing forests for a lifetime. With the spirit of "vigorous construction and conscientious management," the people of Fuyu have persistently and relentlessly grasped the management and protection of forests year after year.
    Whether to rely on the state or on the people themselves is also a question when it comes to afforestation and overcoming wind and sand.
    In the early days of afforestation in Fuyu County, most of the seedlings needed were supplied by state-owned nurseries. Due to the limited number of seedlings, some places could not afford to afforest. At that time, some people said: "If you want to afforest, the higher authorities have to bring seedlings." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants did not agree with this view. They said: We used our hands to grow grain in the past, and now we will use these hands to cultivate seedlings. As a result, an activity of self-run nurseries quickly unfolded throughout the county. Relying on a group of activists in seedling cultivation, districts and villages cultivated seedlings, and the masses jointly established 250 nurseries. Over the past fifteen years, the masses have cultivated and collected more than 130 million seedlings, accounting for 64.8% of the total number of seedlings used for afforestation.
    If you want to afforest, but you don't understand the technology, they will train their own technicians. Over the past fifteen years, the county has trained more than 6,000 technicians by running afforestation technology training classes, and used these people as the backbone to impart afforestation knowledge to the broad masses.
    Afforestation requires a lot of funds. The people of Fuyu rely on themselves to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds. Over the past fifteen years, the county has afforested more than 260,000 mu, of which only 8% was invested by the state.
    The people of Fuyu have also seen their shortcomings. The trees here are mostly poplar, elm, willow, etc., with few precious tree species and few shrubs. Now they are beginning to experiment with introducing precious tree species and planting shrubs to overcome the shortcomings of a single tree species. Last autumn, the county afforested more than 70,000 mu, many of which were precious tree species such as Amur cork and Manchurian ash. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Xiuchun (with pictures)

    敢叫风沙低头
    ——记吉林扶余县造林治沙十五年
    扶余人民进行了十五年的艰苦奋斗，造林二十多万亩，保护了农田，固定了流沙。在大片沙荒上造林不是轻而易举的事，但是由于他们认真发动群众、依靠群众，沙荒终于变成了绿洲。扶余的变化有助于人们更深刻地理解“人民群众有无限的创造力”这个真理。
    汽车在林荫夹道的公路上穿行。十二月的东北，滴水成冰。虽然树叶早已落光，但是从车窗遥望前方，视线还是不时被稠密的树枝挡住。公路两边的田野上，一排排的防护林，纵横交错，保护着一片又一片的农田。村屯外面，林木环绕，果树成行。
    这就是以造林防沙著名的吉林省扶余县。
    这个县从一九五○年开始，十五年来共造林二十六万多亩，其中农田防护林带十二万五千多亩，保护着二百二十五万多亩农田。在流动沙丘上营造固沙林一万五千亩，种草固定流沙面积十万零五千亩。这样，流沙不再随风埋没房屋和耕地，因风沙灾害而废耕的三万亩农田也复耕了。全县社队的三千七百多亩果园，去年生产水果六十八万斤。
    植树造林，使扶余县的自然面貌发生了巨大的变化。据一九六二年九月观测，在林带迎风面相当于树高五倍远的地方，风速比没有林带的地方减弱百分之二十；在林带背风面相当于树高五倍远的地方，风速减弱百分之六十九。营造农田防护林较早的伯都等六个公社，由于有林带的保护，加上其它措施，粮食产量连年稳步提高。扶余原来是个缺少木材的地方，现在每年可以自己解决大量的建筑用材。原来寸草不生的大沙丘，现在成了“百宝山”，社员们在这里拣蘑菇、挖药材、狩猎，增加了副业收入。他们高兴地把林带叫作“粮带”、“宝带”、“幸福带”。
    看到今天的造林成就，扶余人民经常回忆到十五年前的另一番情景。
    扶余县在吉林省的西北部，总面积八百三十一万多亩，耕地面积四百零八万多亩。南、北、西三面被松花江、拉林河环绕。西部和南部沿江一带，有长三百里、宽二里、总面积达十七万多亩的连绵不断的大沙丘。每到大风季节，沙丘随风向东北滚动，埋没良田，吞蚀房屋。这个县的大片农田也常受风沙危害。
    一九五○年，中共扶余县委领导全县人民树立植树造林制服风沙的雄心壮志，按着毛主席的指示，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。并且决定先从营造固沙林、农田防护林入手，同风沙展开斗争。
    当时，大部分群众因为吃尽了风沙灾害的苦头，积极拥护植树造林、防风固沙的主张；一部分群众虽然也迫切要求根治风沙灾害，但是怕造林不顶用，怕栽不活白搭工，怕影响生产，怕占用耕地，因此一时下不了决心；还有少数人对造林固沙不积极。县委认为，必须把领导者的雄心壮志，变为广大群众的实际行动。在这种情况下，怎样使少数人的积极性变成广大群众的积极性呢？毛主席说：“任何有群众的地方，大致都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人。故领导者必须善于团结少数积极分子作为领导的骨干，并凭借这批骨干去提高中间分子，争取落后分子。”中共扶余县委按照主席指示的精神，发动造林积极分子组成宣传队伍，到群众中广泛宣传造林的重大意义和具体政策，算了造林对农业生产的好处、无林的害处、造林用工和造林后的收益等几笔账。区区算，村村算。这样，许多人说：不算不知道，一算吓一跳，造林的好处真不小啊！各级干部一面深入群众宣传造林的意义，一面和贫农下中农一起造林示范。渐渐地，原来有顾虑的人打消了顾虑，原来下不了决心的人下定了决心，原来不积极的人积极起来了。一场改造自然的斗争开始了。每年春秋两季，参加造林的人多达四五万。于是，扶余出现了一片片的“老年林”、“青年林”、“妇女林”、“少年林”……
    扶余县人民在这场战斗中，先外（在沿江的沙丘上植树）后内；先造农田防护林，后造其它林；由西向东，有步骤地逐步开展。十五年来，他们取得了巨大的成绩，涌现出许多先进单位，还有千百个不怕困难、勇于革命、坚持试验的英雄人物。伯都公社农林大队林场场长、全国林业劳动模范田富，就是这样的典型人物。
    田富的老家在靠近沙丘的小溪浪河屯。四十三年前，当田富八岁的时候，流沙逼进屯子，全屯住户被迫弃家北移。当时，穷苦的农民面对风沙灾害，无力抵抗。解放以后，田富眼看着流沙逐渐吞蚀着耕地，十分心痛。党号召植树造林，他心动了，开始琢磨制服流动沙丘的办法。在大风天，他背风坐在沙丘边上观察沙丘移动情况。他边观察、边试验，终于在沙丘上种活了山竹子和柳条。田富的试验得到当地党组织和群众的支持，不久就在大面积上推行。几年以后，这个大队的二十六个沙丘全部被固定了。田富经常说：“要造好林木，非得时刻把思想长在树上才成。”十五年来，他确实做到时刻把思想长在树上。
    林子造起来了，斗争没有结束。造林一时，管林一世。扶余人以“大力造，认真管”的精神，坚持不懈地年复一年地抓紧了对林木的管护工作。
    植树造林，战胜风沙，也有一个是依赖国家，还是依靠人民群众自己的问题。
    扶余县在植树造林的初期，所需苗木大都靠国营苗圃供应。由于苗木数量有限，有些地方就造不起林来。当时有的人说：“要想造林，上级就得拿苗木来。”广大贫农下中农社员不同意这种意见，他们说：咱们过去用双手种出了粮食，现在再用这双手培育出树苗来。于是，一个自办苗圃的活动迅速在全县展开。这个县依靠一批育苗的积极分子，区区育苗，村村育苗，群众共办起苗圃二百五十处。十五年来，群众自己育苗和采集的苗木有一亿三千多万株，占造林总用苗量的百分之六十四点八。
    要造林，不懂技术，他们就自己培养技术人员。十五年来，这个县用办造林技术训练班的办法，培养了六千多名技术人员，以这些人为骨干，向广大群众传授造林知识。
    造林需要大量资金。扶余人就依靠自己解决资金不足的困难。十五年来，全县共造林二十六万多亩，其中国家投资植造的只占百分之八。
    扶余人也看到了自己不足之处。这里的树木多是杨、榆、柳等，珍贵树种很少，灌木很少。现在他们正在开始试验引进珍贵树种，栽植灌木，克服树种单一的缺点。去年秋季全县造林七万多亩，其中有不少是黄菠萝、花曲柳等珍贵树种。　新华社记者　孙修纯（附图片）
