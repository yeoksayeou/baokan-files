    China's First Domestically Designed Comprehensive Marine Scientific Research Vessel Successfully Built
    China's first 2,500-ton comprehensive marine scientific research vessel "Dongfang Hong" (东方红), designed independently by China, has been successfully built by the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard.
    This research vessel is for use by relevant departments to conduct comprehensive surveys and scientific research on the ocean's hydrology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, biology, geology and geomorphology, and aquatic resources. The ship is equipped with more than a dozen laboratories, each equipped with the various instruments and equipment needed for experimentation. On the deck, there are also many mechanical devices specifically for offshore surveys.
      The "Dongfang Hong" comprehensive marine scientific research vessel has a complex structure and relatively high performance requirements. When conducting surveys at sea, sometimes the ship needs to remain stationary, sometimes the required speed is very low, sometimes the ship needs to change direction immediately; the various winches on the deck for survey purposes are required to be practical and easy to operate. These problems have been solved by designers and shipyard workers. (Attached picture)

    我国自行设计的第一艘
    综合性海洋科学考察船建造成功
    我国自行设计的第一艘两千五百吨综合性海洋科学考察船“东方红”号，已由上海沪东造船厂建造成功。
    这艘考察船，是供有关部门对海洋的水文、气象、物理、化学、生物、地质地貌、水产资源等进行综合调查及科学研究用的。船上设有十多个实验室，每个实验室都配备了实验所需要的各种仪器设备。甲板上，还有许多专供海上调查用的机械装置。
      “东方红”综合性海洋科学考察船结构复杂，各项性能要求比较高。在海上进行调查时，有时需要船停止不动，有时每小时航速要求很低，有时需要船身马上转换方向；甲板上供调查用的各种绞车，要求实用和操作方便。这些难题都被设计人员和造船厂职工解决了。（附图片）
