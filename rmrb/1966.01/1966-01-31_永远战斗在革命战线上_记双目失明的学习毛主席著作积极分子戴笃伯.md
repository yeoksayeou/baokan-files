    Always Fighting on the Revolutionary Front
    —In Memory of Dai Dubo, an Activist in Studying Chairman Mao's Works Who is Blind

    Do you remember the Korean War correspondence written by the writer Wei Wei, "Young People, Make Your Youth More Beautiful!"? The first heroic figure praised in that correspondence was Dai Dubo, a cultural instructor of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers at the time. More than ten years have passed, what is Dai Dubo's current situation?

    Dai Dubo is now the political instructor of the Purchasing and Marketing Department of the Hanshou County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hunan Province. This Communist Party member, who was blinded after being wounded in the Korean War, has persevered in studying Chairman Mao's works for the past ten years with indomitable revolutionary spirit and amazing willpower, and has applied what he has learned in a lively manner. The Party's cordial teachings and the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought have enabled him to maintain a strong revolutionary fighting spirit, withstand the various tests of war and peace, and make many inspiring model deeds.

    One Saturday night. The employees of the hemp twine sales department of the Purchasing and Marketing Department had already left work, and the young people had also gone to see operas and movies, singing and laughing; only Gao Xianyuan was left on duty.

    Suddenly, with a "Yikes!" a middle-aged man who was blind came groping into the door. He held a golden "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in both hands, and said with a chuckle: "Old Gao, I'm here to keep you company again." When Gao Xianyuan saw him, he said happily: "Good, you've come at the right time." After a while, the sound of loud reading of "Serve the People" came from the sales department.

    This blind man is Dai Dubo. The employees of the hemp twine sales department are familiar with Dai Dubo's habit: regardless of whether it is a festival or a regular holiday, and no matter who is on duty, he always gropes his way to the sales department to talk with the comrades on duty and study Chairman Mao's works together. A few years ago, his left eye still had a little light perception, so he took a magnifying glass and "gnawed" at the words one by one. After becoming completely blind, he could no longer study on his own, so he asked people to read it to him over and over again. Later, he made learning friends everywhere, and when he talked with comrades, if he encountered problems that could not be solved, he would consult Chairman Mao's works together; some comrades asked him for help in preparing speeches, so they would study the relevant chapters of Chairman Mao's works together; before meetings, he would also seize the time to ask the comrades around him to read a paragraph; when schools invited him to give reports, he would take the opportunity to ask the teachers for advice....

    In this way, this blind man, using every possible means and not letting go of any opportunity, persisted in studying. In more than ten years, he has completed the first to fourth volumes of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong". Some articles, such as "On Contradiction", "On Practice", "Serve the People", "In Memory of Norman Bethune", "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", etc., have been studied repeatedly more than ten times; he can also recite some important chapters in whole paragraphs.

    His brain was injured, which affected his memory. In order to deepen the impression of what he had learned in his mind, he tried to write learning experiences. At first, he used a ruler to guide his writing, but when people looked at it, the words were overlapping and the lines were stacked, a dark blur, and nothing could be seen. Later, he designed a writing frame, and because he had not held a pen for a long time, his hand trembled when he wrote, and the words he wrote were also crooked and unsightly. He was not discouraged. He thought: "If the Foolish Old Man can move mountains, can't I even write a few words?" He persisted in practicing, writing stroke by stroke, two or three hundred words every day. Every night, he also asked his daughter, who was studying in elementary school, to write words in his palm with her fingers, both to check his learning and to learn simplified characters. After a few months, he finally wrote out characters and was gradually able to write his experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. Then, he further applied writing to his work. In the past two or three years, he has personally drafted more than thirty rules and regulations, requests for instructions, and work summaries.

    Dai Dubo is such a revolutionary warrior. On that fiery battlefield in Korea, he refused to leave the front line with minor injuries and fiercely attacked the enemy. His youth radiated brilliant light. After he was blinded, for more than ten years, he still stood up straight with the chest of a revolutionary, fighting on the revolutionary "front line", advancing in the face of difficulties. He was filled with deep hatred for U.S. imperialism and said resolutely: "The American devils blinded my eyes, but I still have a mouth, a pair of hands, and a heart. I can still work for the Party and the people, and I still want to make revolution..." He said it and he did it.

    In 1955, when Dai Dubo was assigned to work in the Hanshou County Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, although his external injuries had healed, only his left eye had a little light perception, which was very inconvenient for work, study and life. However, his red revolutionary heart was tightly attracted by the boiling socialist construction of the motherland. He was determined to dedicate all his efforts to the motherland and the people. He followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "learn warfare through warfare" and resolved to "learn to work in work". He took a magnifying glass and used his only bit of light perception to study Chairman Mao's works word by word. After he studied Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Methods of Work", people often saw Dai Dubo groping to talk to comrades in the late of night, caring for everyone's life with meticulous care. He groped to the rooms of sick comrades several times a day, asking about their health, delivering medicine and water, and tending to their needs. Hearing that a comrade's wife had given birth or that someone's family was not being taken care of, he always took the time to visit and help solve difficulties. He wanted to send more of the warmth of the revolutionary family to the hearts of every comrade. Unfortunately, soon after, his left eye also went blind.

    On his glorious life journey, how many difficulties has Dai Dubo, who is blind, overcome! He relied on that proletarian backbone, on that red revolutionary heart armed with Mao Zedong Thought, to fight with youthful vitality on the revolutionary "front line". He said: "My eyes were blinded by the American devils' shells. If I bowed my head in the face of difficulties, I would be surrendering to the American devils. No, I must continue the struggle."

    When the Party Central Committee's directive on cadres participating in collective productive labor was issued, he did not relax his demands on himself because of his disability, but overcame all difficulties and actively participated in labor. Who can imagine how difficult it is for a blind person to carry water, sweep the floor, and "tie hemp"? Dai Dubo often helped the kitchen carry water. In the beginning, he couldn't fetch the water, and he had to ask someone to retrieve the bucket. Later, he used hemp rope to tie the bucket to the bamboo hook, and he learned to fetch and carry water alone. When he swept the floor, he couldn't see, and the floor wasn't swept clean. He would sweep it again and again, and then touch it with his hand. If he couldn't sweep it clean once, he would sweep it twice until the floor was clean. Although it was so difficult to move a bundle of hemp weighing more than 150 kilograms, and the work of "tying hemp" was so meticulous that his thumb and index finger were often chafed raw, the workers advised him: "This is a technical job, and it requires strength. You can't do it because your eyes are bad. If you don't participate in labor, who would say anything about you!" But he insisted on not leaving the "front line" and soon learned to "tie hemp." He said to his comrades: "If revolutionary cadres are to never change color, they must participate in labor."

    In June 1963, he had just been transferred to the hemp twine sales department when he encountered problems. The quality of hemp twine had declined, and there was a large backlog, so that the higher authorities notified that purchases be stopped. This was a major issue related to the lives of thousands of people! He organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" to investigate the reasons and find the contradictions; he also groped his way to neighborhood groups to hold discussions, conduct propaganda and explanations; the masses reflected that the scales in the sales department were inaccurate, so he carried the scales and groped his way to the homes of the masses to test them on the spot. The masses said that some employees in the sales department had a bad service attitude, so he led everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together. After a series of investigations, studies, and arduous ideological work, the quality of hemp twine was greatly improved and was rated as a famous brand product in the special zone. Under Dai Dubo's leadership, the comrades in the hemp twine sales department greatly improved their awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works, and their work became better and better, becoming a red banner on the county's commercial front.

    People will ask: What force enables this blind man to overcome one difficulty after another and make shining achievements in ordinary work? It is the great Mao Zedong Thought. Dai Dubo often said: "U.S. imperialism ruined my eyes, but Mao Zedong Thought gave me a pair of spiritual eyes, which are brighter than the original eyes!" Yes! It is this pair of bright spiritual eyes that enabled the young Dai Dubo to withstand the severe war test of guns and bullets; it is this pair of bright spiritual eyes that enabled the blind Dai Dubo to confidently overcome numerous difficulties and stand firm on the "front line" of the socialist revolution. Mao Zedong Thought, this pair of bright spiritual eyes, will forever guide Dai Dubo and the thousands upon thousands of Chinese people, with radiant spirit, to rush towards a bright and sunny future!　Ji Ming (Attached picture)

    永远战斗在革命战线上
    ——记双目失明的学习毛主席著作积极分子戴笃伯
    你还记得作家魏巍写的《年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧！》那篇朝鲜通讯吗？那篇通讯里第一个歌颂的英雄人物，是当时中国人民志愿军某部文化教员戴笃伯。十多年过去了，戴笃伯的近况怎样？
    戴笃伯现在是湖南省汉寿县供销社采购经理部的政治指导员。这位在朝鲜战场负伤后双目失明的共产党员，十年来，以坚忍不拔的革命精神、惊人的毅力，坚持不懈地学习毛主席著作，并且活学活用。党的亲切教导，毛泽东思想的哺育，使他始终保持着旺盛的革命斗志，经受了战争环境与和平环境的各种考验，做出了许多令人激动不已的模范事迹。
    一个星期六的夜晚。采购经理部麻线门市部的职工们已经下班了，年青人也都唱着笑着看戏看电影去了；只剩下高贤源一个人在值班。
    突然，“呀”的一声，一个双目失明的中年人摸进门来。他双手捧着一本金光灿灿的《毛泽东选集》，呵呵笑着说：“老高，我又来同你做伴了。”高贤源一看见他，高兴地说：“好，来得正好。”一会儿，从门市部里传出了诵读《为人民服务》的琅琅书声。
    这位双目失明的人，就是戴笃伯。麻线门市部的职工们都熟悉戴笃伯有这样的习惯：不管逢年过节或例假，也不问是什么人在值班，他总要摸到门市部来，跟值班的同志谈谈心，一起学习毛主席著作。前几年，他的左眼还有一点光感，他就拿着放大镜，一个字一个字地
  “啃”。双眼失明以后，自学不行了，他就请人一遍遍念。后来，他又到处结交学习朋友，跟同志谈心时，遇到问题不能解决，就一起向毛主席著作请教；有的同志为了准备发言，请他帮助，就一起学习毛主席著作的有关章节；开会前，也抓紧时间请身边的同志给念一段；学校请他去作报告，就顺便向老师请教……。
    就这样，这个双目失明的人，利用一切可能，不放过一切机会，坚持学习，在十多年的时间里，学完了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，其中一些文章如《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等，反复学习了十多遍；一些重要章节，他还能整段地背诵。
    他的脑子受过伤，影响记忆力。为了使学过的东西在脑子里加深印象，他试着写学习心得。开始，他用尺子比划着写，请人一看，字压字，行叠行，黑糊糊一片，什么也看不出来。以后，他设计了一个写字架，又因为长时间没有拿笔，写起字来手就颤抖，写出来的字也是歪歪扭扭，不象样子。他并不灰心丧气。他想：“愚公能够移山，我未必连几个字也写不成？”他坚持不懈地练，一笔一划地写，每天写二三百字。每天晚上，他又找在小学读书的女儿用手指头在他手心里写字，一面检查学习，一面学习简化字。几个月以后，终于写出字样，慢慢能写学习毛主席著作的心得了。接着，他又进一步把写字用到工作上，近二三年来，他亲笔起草的规章制度、请示报告、工作总结，有三十多篇。
    戴笃伯，就是这样的革命勇士，在那满天烽火的朝鲜战场上，他轻伤不下火线，狠狠地打击敌人，他的青春放射出绚丽璀璨的光辉。他双目失明以后，十多年来，仍然挺起革命者的胸膛，奋战在革命的
  “火线”上，迎着困难前进。他满怀着对美帝国主义的刻骨仇恨，坚毅地说：“美国鬼子打瞎了我的眼睛，我还有一张嘴，一双手，一颗心，我还可以为党为人民工作，我还要干革命。……”他说到那里，做到那里。
    一九五五年，当戴笃伯被分配到汉寿县花纱布公司工作的时候，外伤虽已痊愈，一双眼睛却只有左眼有一点点光感，工作、学习和生活上都很不便。可是，他的一颗革命的红心，被祖国沸腾的社会主义建设紧紧地吸引住了。他下定决心要把自己的心血全部献给祖国和人民。他遵照毛主席说的要“从战争学习战争”的教导，决心“在工作中学会工作”。他拿着放大镜，用仅有的一点光感，一个字一个字地学习主席著作。当他学习了毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》以后，人们常常看到，在一个又一个深夜，戴笃伯摸着找同志们谈心，无微不至地关怀着大家的生活。他一天几次摸到有病同志的房里，问寒问暖，为病人送药送水，端屎端尿。听到哪个同志的爱人生小孩，或者谁的家里无人照顾，他总是抽空摸去探望，帮助解决困难。他要把革命大家庭里的温暖更多地送到每个同志的心里。不幸，不久之后，他的左眼也失明了。
    双目失明的戴笃伯，在他那光辉的生活历程上，战胜了多少困难呵！他就是凭着那副无产阶级硬骨头，凭着那颗为毛泽东思想武装起来的革命红心，青春焕发地战斗在革命的“火线”上。他说：“我的眼睛是美国鬼子的炮弹打瞎的，我要是在困难面前低头，就是向美国鬼子屈膝投降。不行，我要继续斗争下去。”
    当党中央关于干部参加集体生产劳动的指示下达后，他没有因为残废而放松对自己的要求，而是克服一切困难，积极参加劳动。谁能想象得到，瞎子挑水、扫地、“扎麻”多么困难？戴笃伯却经常帮伙房挑水。开头几次，水没打上来，还得请人打捞水桶，后来，他用麻绳把水桶系在竹钩上，就学会一个人打水、挑水了。他扫地，眼睛看不见，地扫的不干净，他就扫过以后，用手摸一摸，一次扫不干净，扫两次，把地扫干净。尽管搬动一捆一百五十多斤的麻多么吃力，“扎麻”的活这样细致，虎口常常被麻磨得皮破血流，职工们劝他：“这是技术活，又要力气，你眼睛不好，搞不得。你不参加劳动，谁还会说你什么！”但是，他坚持不下“火线”，不久就学会了“扎麻”。他对同志们说：“革命干部要永远不变色，就要参加劳动。”
    一九六三年六月，他刚刚调到麻线门市部，就碰到了问题，麻线质量下降，大量积压，以致上级通知停止收购。这是关系到几千群众生活的大事呵！他就组织大伙儿反复学习毛主席的《矛盾论》，查原因，找矛盾；又摸到居民小组开座谈会，进行宣传解释；群众反映门市部的秤不准，他就带着秤，摸到群众家里当面试验。群众说门市部有的职工服务态度不好，他又领导大伙儿一起学习《纪念白求恩》。经过一系列的调查研究和艰苦的思想工作，麻线的质量大大提高了，被评为专区的名牌货。麻线门市部的同志们，在戴笃伯的带动下，学习毛主席著作的自觉性大大提高了，工作越做越好，成了全县商业战线上的红旗。
    人们会问：是什么力量使这个双目失明的人，去战胜一个一个困难，在平凡的工作中做出闪闪发光的成绩呢？是伟大的毛泽东思想。戴笃伯常常这样说：“美帝国主义打坏了我的眼睛，而毛泽东思想给了我一双精神眼睛，这比原来的眼睛更加明亮！”是呵！是这双明亮的精神眼睛，使年轻的戴笃伯经受了严峻的枪林弹雨的战争考验；是这双明亮的精神眼睛，使双目失明的戴笃伯信心百倍地战胜重重困难，坚守在社会主义革命“火线”上。毛泽东思想，这双明亮的精神眼睛呵，将永远指引着戴笃伯和千千万万的中国人民，神采焕发地朝着阳光灿烂的未来疾驰！　纪铭（附图片）
