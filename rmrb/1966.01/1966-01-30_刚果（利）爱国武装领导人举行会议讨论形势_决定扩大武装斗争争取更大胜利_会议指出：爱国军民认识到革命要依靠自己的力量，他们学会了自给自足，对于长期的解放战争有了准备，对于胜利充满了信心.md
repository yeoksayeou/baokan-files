    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: According to a recent report in the Algerian weekly *African Revolution*, some leaders of the Congolese (Léopoldville) patriotic armed forces held a meeting in the Ruzizi River Valley in eastern Congo (Léopoldville) last December. They studied the situation of the armed struggle in the Congo (Léopoldville) and decided to continue relying on their own strength in the new year, use the strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare, and strengthen and expand the armed struggle.
    The article stated that the leaders attending the meeting pointed out that after more than a year of struggle, the political awareness of the Congolese (Léopoldville) patriotic armed fighters and people has been continuously improved, and their morale is high. They recognize that revolution is their own business and that struggle must first rely on their own strength. They have learned from the heroic examples of other revolutionary people in Asia and Africa and are psychologically prepared for a protracted war of liberation. The people in the liberated areas have learned to be self-sufficient.
    The article stated that these leaders pointed out that the Congolese (Léopoldville) patriotic armed forces have made achievements in their efforts to strengthen military organization and improve combat techniques. Patriots annihilated several companies of Mobutu's soldiers commanded by white mercenaries in Yangambi, Fizi, Baraka, Idiolo, and Kasongo. On Christmas night last year, the patriotic armed forces launched lightning strikes against Stanleyville and Kasongo. They entered Stanleyville and occupied the left bank of the Congo River before dawn, driving away the puppet troops there. After seizing weapons and grain from the puppet army's warehouses, they withdrew automatically. The patriotic armed commandos have learned to manufacture and skillfully use hand grenades and landmines. Last November, they blew up the strategically important Kamaniola Bridge and laid landmines in Bontaiville, Bukavu, and Albertville, destroying many enemy trucks.
    The article stated that the leaders attending the meeting said that the Congolese revolutionaries have great faith in themselves. They are more confident than ever in victory. For them, victory is a historical necessity.
    The article stated that these leaders pointed out that under the rule of the Mobutu puppet clique, former colonial administrative officials and officers have made a large-scale comeback, and colonial companies are intensifying their exploitation of the Congolese people. The Congolese people are becoming increasingly intolerable of colonial rule. In the Congo (Léopoldville), economic and social crises will accelerate and worsen.
    The article stated that the leaders attending the meeting formulated concrete plans for the Congolese (Léopoldville) patriotic armed forces in 1966. They pointed out that in 1966, it is necessary to strengthen and expand the armed struggle, strengthen and expand political and ideological work, establish political and military training schools in various regions, and strive for greater victory.

    刚果（利）爱国武装领导人举行会议讨论形势
    决定扩大武装斗争争取更大胜利
    会议指出：爱国军民认识到革命要依靠自己的力量，他们学会了自给自足，对于长期的解放战争有了准备，对于胜利充满了信心
    新华社二十八日讯　据阿尔及利亚《非洲革命》周刊最近报道，刚果（利）爱国武装的一些领导人去年十二月在刚果（利）东部的鲁齐齐河谷举行了会议。他们研究了刚果（利）武装斗争的形势，决定在新的一年中继续依靠自己的力量，运用游击战争的战略战术，加强和扩大武装斗争。
    文章说，参加会议的领导人指出，刚果（利）爱国武装的战士和人民经过一年多的斗争，政治觉悟不断提高，士气高涨。他们认识到革命是他们自己的事情，认识到斗争首先要依靠他们自己的力量。他们学习了亚非其他革命人民的英勇榜样，对于长期的解放战争有了心理准备。解放区人民学会了自给自足。
    文章说，这些领导人指出，刚果（利）爱国武装努力加强军事组织和改进作战技术，已经取得了成果。爱国者在扬甘比、菲齐、巴拉卡、伊迪奥法和卡松戈歼灭了由白人雇佣军指挥的几个连的蒙博托的士兵。爱国武装在去年圣诞节的夜晚对斯坦利维尔和卡松戈采取了闪电式的袭击，他们曾进入斯坦利维尔，在黎明以前占领了刚果河的左岸，赶跑了那里的傀儡军队。他们在傀儡军队的仓库中夺取了武器和粮食之后自动撤走。爱国武装的突击队已经会制造并熟练地运用手榴弹和地雷。他们在去年十一月炸毁了具有战略意义的卡马尼奥拉桥，并在邦泰维尔、布卡武、阿伯特维尔埋设地雷，炸毁了敌军许多卡车。
    文章说，参加会议的领导人说，刚果革命者非常相信他们自己。他们比以往更加相信胜利，对他们来说，胜利是一种历史必然性。
    文章说，这些领导人指出，在蒙博托傀儡集团的统治下，前殖民行政官员和军官大批地卷土重来，殖民公司变本加厉地对刚果人民进行剥削，刚果人民对于殖民统治越来越不能忍受。在刚果（利），经济和社会危机将加速恶化。
    文章说，参加会议的领导人制定了刚果（利）爱国武装一九六六年的具体计划。他们指出，在一九六六年要加强和扩大武装斗争，加强和扩大政治思想工作，在各个地区内建立政治、军事的训练学校，争取更大的胜利。
