    The Cambodian military and civilians have recently and resolutely and valiantly repelled the successive armed invasions by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, Thailand and South Vietnam, fully demonstrating the determination and strength of the Cambodian people to resolutely safeguard national independence and territorial sovereignty. The Cambodian people are not to be trifled with.
    U.S. imperialism has always regarded the Royal Government of Cambodia, which pursues an independent, peaceful, and neutral policy, as a "thorn in its side" and has long wanted to remove it. Like the former French colonialists and Japanese militarists, it wants to gain a foothold in Cambodia and then invade other countries. McClintock, the first U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, declared that his mission was to turn Cambodia into an "American fortress." Shortly after the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords, the United States unilaterally included Cambodia in the so-called "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which was severely rejected by the Cambodian people. Prince Sihanouk at that time made a statement on the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying: "We have never asked for this kind of protection. We do not need this kind of protection. We do not want to have any relationship with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or other military treaties at all." Later, the United States intensified its planning of various conspiracies to overthrow the Cambodian government. The United States once instructed the Cambodian national traitors it supported and fostered, the “Free Khmer” bandits, to conduct multiple invasions and subversive activities against Cambodia. These shameful conspiracies did not succeed.
    However, U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to its failure. Since 1956, U.S. imperialism has continuously directed its South Vietnamese and Thai puppet servants to invade Cambodian territory and airspace, create border armed conflicts, and impose economic blockades on Cambodia. By the end of 1964, the South Vietnamese puppet army alone had carried out as many as 300 armed invasions against Cambodia, many of which were directly participated in by U.S. military personnel, causing loss of life and property to many innocent residents of Cambodia.
    In order to counter the aggression and provocative activities of U.S. imperialism, the Cambodian people have taken a series of anti-aggression and anti-interference measures. On November 19, 1963, the Special Congress of the Cambodian People passed a resolution rejecting all U.S. "aid" and demanding that the United States withdraw all its military, economic, and cultural institutions stationed in Cambodia. In March 1964, the people of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and the provinces of Kampong Cham, and Kampot, successively held large-scale demonstrations to protest against the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism. The Cambodian government has repeatedly lodged strong protests with the United States and South Vietnam, sent letters to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference reiterating the proposal to convene the Geneva Conference, and once filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. As Prince Sihanouk once pointed out, the result of complaining to the United Nations is nothing more than a "farce." The United Nations, controlled by the United States, can only serve the U.S. aggressive policy and will never speak for the bullied Cambodian people.
    Since last year, the threats, provocations, and subversive activities of the United States and its lackeys South Vietnam and Thailand against Cambodia have become even more intensified. U.S.-South Vietnamese aircraft frequently bomb Cambodian territory. At the same time, under the direction of the United States, the South Vietnamese puppet army and the Thai reactionaries have carried out increasingly rampant invasions against Cambodia. In the month of April last year alone, the South Vietnamese puppet army carried out more than 50 invasions of Cambodian territory, airspace, and territorial waters. Last August, under the instigation of the United States, Thailand brazenly blockaded the Thai-Cambodian border and continuously carried out armed invasions. U.S. imperialism has also stooped to personal attacks on Cambodian national leaders. In order to fight back against the frantic provocations of U.S. imperialism, the Cambodian people have waged a tit-for-tat struggle. Prince Sihanouk resolutely announced on May 3 last year that, because the United States disregarded Cambodian national dignity, he had decided to sever diplomatic relations with the United States.
    Recently, after U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara's seventh visit to Saigon, the Johnson administration has stepped up its planning and implementation of adventurous steps to expand the war of aggression in South Vietnam and throughout Indochina, and Cambodia has become a target of aggression by the United States and its lackeys. The U.S. imperialist military aggression against Cambodia is becoming more and more rampant, and the scale is expanding day by day. The U.S. government openly declared that it has authorized the commander of its combat troops in South Vietnam, under the pretext of so-called "self-defense," to enter Cambodian territory to "pursue Communist forces." This is an extremely serious signal that U.S. imperialism is expanding the flames of war to Cambodia.
    The armed aggression of U.S. imperialism cannot intimidate the Cambodian people. The Cambodian government has recently issued several serious warnings to U.S. imperialism and its servants: in order to deal with a full-scale U.S. invasion, Cambodia has made deployments in terms of national defense, and Cambodia will use the means it possesses to resist all attacks at all costs in order to defend Cambodia's independence, neutrality, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

### 美帝一贯与柬埔寨人民为敌

    美帝一贯与柬埔寨人民为敌
    柬埔寨军民最近坚决英勇地击退了美帝国主义及其走狗泰国和南越军队接二连三的武装侵犯，充分表现出柬埔寨人民坚决维护国家独立和领土主权的决心和力量。柬埔寨人民是不可轻侮的。
    美帝国主义一直把执行独立、和平和中立政策的柬埔寨王国政府视作“眼中钉”，长期来都想把它拔掉。象从前的法国殖民者和日本军国主义一样，在柬埔寨取得立足点，然后向他国侵略。美国首任驻柬埔寨大使麦克林托克扬言，他的使命是把柬埔寨变成一个“美国堡垒”。一九五四年日内瓦协议签订后不久，美国片面地把柬埔寨列入东南亚条约组织的所谓“保护”范围之内，遭到了柬埔寨人民的严正拒绝。西哈努克亲王当时曾就东南亚条约的“保护”发表谈话说：“我们从未要求过这种保护。我们也不需要这种保护。我们根本不想同东南亚条约组织或其他军事条约发生任何关系。”以后，美国加紧策划各种阴谋活动来推翻柬埔寨政府，美国曾指使它所支持和豢养的柬埔寨民族叛徒
  “自由高棉”匪帮多次对柬埔寨进行入侵和颠覆活动。这些可耻的阴谋都没有得逞。
    但是，美帝国主义并不死心。从一九五六年起，美帝国主义不断指使它的仆从南越和泰国傀儡侵犯柬埔寨的领土、领空，制造边境武装冲突，以及对柬埔寨实行经济封锁。到一九六四年底，仅南越伪军就对柬埔寨进行了多达三百次的武装侵略，其中不少次是有美国军事人员直接参与的，这使柬埔寨许多无辜居民的生命财产受到损失。
    为了反击美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅活动，柬埔寨人民采取了一系列的反侵略和反干涉措施。一九六三年十一月十九日，柬埔寨人民特别代表大会通过决议，拒绝美国一切“援助”、要求美国撤出驻在柬埔寨的军事、经济和文化方面的一切机构。一九六四年三月，柬埔寨首都金边和磅湛、唝吥等省人民连续举行大规模示威，抗议美帝国主义的干涉和侵略。柬埔寨政府曾多次向美国和南越提出强烈抗议，致函日内瓦会议两主席重申召开日内瓦会议的主张，并且一度向联合国安全理事会提出控诉。正如西哈努克亲王曾指出的，向联合国控诉的结果，不过是一出“滑稽戏”而已。由美国操纵的联合国只能给美国的侵略政策服务，决不会为受欺侮的柬埔寨人民执言。
    去年以来，美国和它的走狗南越和泰国对柬埔寨的威胁、挑衅和颠覆活动更是变本加厉。美国—南越飞机不时轰炸柬埔寨领土。同时，在美国指使下，南越伪军和泰国反动派对柬埔寨进行了越来越猖狂的侵犯。仅南越伪军在去年四月一个月中，对柬埔寨领土、领空和领海的侵犯就达五十多次。去年八月，在美国唆使下泰国又悍然封锁泰柬边境并不断进行武装入侵。美帝国主义还穷极无聊地对柬埔寨国家领导人展开人身攻击。为了回击美帝国主义的疯狂挑衅，柬埔寨人民进行了针锋相对的斗争。西哈努克亲王去年五月三日毅然宣布，由于美国无视柬埔寨民族尊严，决定同美国断绝外交关系。
    最近，在美国国防部长麦克纳马拉第七次访问西贡以后，约翰逊政府加紧策划和推行在南越以及在整个印度支那扩大侵略战争的冒险步骤，柬埔寨更成了美国及其走狗侵犯的目标。美帝国主义对柬埔寨的军事侵犯越来越猖狂，而且规模日益扩大。美国政府公然宣称，已经授权它在南越的作战部队司令，借口所谓“自卫”，可以进入柬埔寨领土
  “追击共产党部队”。这是美帝国主义把侵略战火扩大到柬埔寨的一个极其严重的信号。
    美帝国主义的武装侵略是吓不倒柬埔寨人民的。柬埔寨政府最近曾多次向美帝国主义及其仆从提出严重警告：为了对付美国的全面入侵，柬埔寨已在国防方面作好了部署，柬埔寨将以自己所拥有的手段，不惜代价抗击一切进攻，以保卫柬埔寨的独立、中立、主权和领土完整。　（根）
