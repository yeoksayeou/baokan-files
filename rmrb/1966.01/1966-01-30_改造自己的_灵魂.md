    Transforming One's "Soul"
    How can the great achievements of our motherland on all fronts not be inspiring! How can the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought not make people stride forward with our heads held high and chests out! As a film actor, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, how can I correctly exert my role in the revolution? How can I link myself to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution? How can I link myself to the long-term goal of communism?
    Our actors should first love the revolution and never first love the acting profession. Otherwise, it is not acting for the revolution, but acting for personal interests or personal fame.
    Not long ago, I once devoted myself to labor in a factory according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Indeed, I strictly demanded of myself, and all my work was relatively normal. We not only labored together with the worker comrades, but also performed for the workers in our spare time. In order to reflect the good people and good deeds of the factory, we specifically sought out scripts created by the workers in the factory. I served as the director of this play and also played the role of an actor in the play, performing with three workers. When I was doing these things, my thoughts were very clear, that is, to try every means to establish a relationship with the worker comrades, to find more opportunities to learn from the workers, to serve the workers through various forms, and at the same time to help the factory carry out cultural activities. I thought that doing this was following Chairman Mao's thought, and it was correct. After the performance, although the worker comrades felt close to the events reflected in the play and also praised the ideology of the play, compared with other more mature programs, it always felt plain and unremarkable, not exciting, and therefore there was no curtain call.
    At that time, I wanted to withdraw the play. The reason why I had such an idea was because the audience all knew that I was an old actor, and since I was on stage, I should show my skills, otherwise the audience would be disappointed in me.
    It happened that I met the old worker I played, and I said: "We are the same age, both fifty-six, but your body is still very strong." He said: "Of course, every day is like celebrating the New Year!" He meant that before liberation, we could only eat such a meal during the Spring Festival, but now we can eat New Year's meals every day, so of course the body will be strong. I said: "You work as hard as a strong young man, I am far worse than you." He said: "You can't rest, there are still many people in the world who live worse than us!" I immediately felt that as soon as he spoke, he looked at the world, and he linked his life so closely with the revolutionary cause. At the same time, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, the worker's hands are black, but how clean he is, and how dirty is my soul! I am determined to talk about this idea to the comrades and let everyone help me wash it clean. In the new year, I will take a further step forward on the road of integrating with the workers and peasants and serve the workers, peasants and soldiers better.

    改造自己的“灵魂”
    我们祖国各个战线上取得的伟大成就，怎能不令人振奋！毛泽东思想的光辉胜利，怎能不叫人昂首阔步，扬眉吐气！做为一个电影演员，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，如何正确发挥自己对革命的作用？怎样把自己同中国革命和世界革命联系起来？同共产主义远大目标联系起来？
    我们演员应当首先热爱革命，决不能首先热爱演员工作。否则，就不是为革命而演戏，而是为了个人爱好或个人出名而演戏了。
    不久前，我曾经按照毛主席的教导，投身于工厂的劳动中，的确，我也严格的要求自己，一切工作都比较正常。我们不只和工人师傅共同劳动，还在业余时间为工人演戏。为了能反映工厂的好人好事，我们又专找厂里工人创作的剧本。我作了这个戏的导演，又担任了剧中的演员，和三位工人一道演戏。当我做这些事的时候，思想里很明确，即想尽一切方法与工人同志建立感情，找更多机会向工人学习，通过各种形式为工人服务，同时又帮助工厂开展文艺活动。我想，这样作是按照主席思想办事的，是正确的。当演出之后，虽然工人同志对这个戏反映的事件感到亲切，对戏思想性也很称赞，但和其他较为成熟的节目相比，总觉得平平淡淡，没有什么戏，看起来不带劲，因此也没谢幕。
    当时我就想把这个戏撤下来。所以产生这样的念头，那就是因为观众都知道我是个老演员，我既然出场，就应该露一手，不然观众就会对我失望。
    正好和我扮演的那位老工人碰到一起，我说：“咱俩同岁，都是五十六，可你的身体还很壮。”他说：“赶情，天天都在过年！”意思是解放前只有春节才能吃这样一顿饭，而现在每天都能吃年饭，身体当然要壮。我说：“你干起活来和壮年人一样，我比你差远了。”他说：“不能休息，世上还有好多人生活不如咱们！”我马上觉得他一说话就放眼世界，他把自己的生活和革命事业联系得那么紧。同时我想起毛主席的教导，工人的手虽是黑的，但是他多么干净，而我的灵魂又是多么脏啊！我决心把我的这个念头向同志们谈出来，让大家帮助我洗干净。在新的一年里，我将在同工农结合的道路上更向前迈进一步，更好地为工农兵服务。
