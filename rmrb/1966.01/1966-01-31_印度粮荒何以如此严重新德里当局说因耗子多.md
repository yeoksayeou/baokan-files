    (Dispatch from this newspaper) Washington, D.C., January 30 (New China News Agency) The U.S. Senate Democratic Leader, Mansfield, made a statement on January 28, opposing sending food to India, asserting that it would mean a waste of American people’s money.

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) London, January 30 (New China News Agency) An Indian government trade delegation recently arrived in London to negotiate with the British government for assistance in resolving India’s current economic difficulties.

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) New Delhi, January 30 (New China News Agency) According to reports, India's grain shortage is currently extremely severe. In various regions, food riots have occurred one after another. The Indian government has mobilized police and troops to suppress them.

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) New Delhi, (via AP) The Indian Ministry of Health released a report saying that there are an estimated 2.4 billion rats in India, which eat more than 26 million tons of grain each year. It is said that if the grain were not spoiled by rats, it would not only be enough to eliminate the current threat of famine, but would also make India a country with surplus grain.
    The Indian authorities are obviously trying to blame the severe grain shortage on rats and shirk their own responsibilities.

    印度粮荒何以如此严重新德里当局说因耗子多
    本报讯　美联社从新德里报道，印度政府卫生部发表报告说，估计印度有二十四亿只老鼠，每年吃掉的谷物达二千六百多万吨。据说，如果粮食不被老鼠糟塌的话，不仅足以消除目前的饥荒威胁，而且会使印度变成一个有余粮的国家。
    印度当局显然是想把严重的粮荒归咎于老鼠，而推卸自己的责任。
