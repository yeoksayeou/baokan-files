    People Change, Thinking Changes, Factory Changes Appearance
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Rolling Mill, Electrical Workshop, Electrical Foreman Su Jin

    Opinions vary on how much Ma'anshan Iron and Steel has changed. Chairman Mao said that the Chinese revolution has only completed the first step of the Long March. The revolution at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel, I am afraid, has not even completed this first step. Looking back, we have taken a step forward; looking forward, the Long March road is still long. We cannot stand on the top of the mountain and look down, lest we become complacent; we must stand at the foot of the mountain and look up, to encourage ourselves. We cannot compare the new Ma'anshan Iron and Steel with the old Ma'anshan Iron and Steel, we must compare the new Ma'anshan Iron and Steel with Daqing. In this way, we can do better and better, be stricter and stricter, and constantly revolutionize and advance. With the thinking of the people of Daqing, we can become people of the Daqing type; with the spirit of Daqing, we can run enterprises of the Daqing type.
    We understand that the first thing in carrying out revolution is to do it; doing it is the manifestation of a revolutionary mental state. But in the past, we did it, and now we still do it. It is still the same doing, but the results are different. Thinking carefully, in the past, we did not do it according to Mao Zedong Thought, we did it in a muddled way, so we did not do it well. Now we do it according to Mao Zedong Thought, it is truly carrying out revolution, with both great goals and specific measures, it is doing it with soaring enthusiasm and striving for the upstream. In this way, the more we do it, the more energetic we become, and the more we do it, the more interesting it becomes.

    人变思想厂变容
    马钢一轧厂电机工段电气工长　苏瑾
    马钢究竟变了多少，看法不一。毛主席说，中国革命才走完了万里长征的第一步。马钢的革命，恐怕连这第一步也没有走完。向后看，我们向前走了一步，向前看，万里长征路正长。我们不能站在山顶看山下，免得自满，要站在山下望山顶，以此自勉。我们不能把新马钢和老马钢比，要把新马钢和大庆比。这样，才能做到好上加好，严了再严，才能不断革命，不断前进。有了大庆人的思想，才能做大庆式的人，有了大庆精神，才能办大庆式的企业。
    我们理解，干革命首先一条是干，干是革命精神状态的表现。但过去是我们干，现在还是我们干，同样是干，结果不同。细想起来，过去干，没有照毛泽东思想干，是糊里糊涂地干，所以干的不好；现在干，是照毛泽东思想干，是真干革命，既有伟大目标，又有具体措施，是鼓足干劲力争上游的干，这样，才越干越有劲，越干越有味。
