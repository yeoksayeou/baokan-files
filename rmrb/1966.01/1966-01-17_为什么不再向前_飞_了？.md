    What is the main task of a county committee? It is to hand over policies and plans to the masses and, through the masses, transform them into material wealth. This is to transform the world. To achieve this "transformation," we must do arduous work and pay a considerable price. This price is often much greater than obtaining correct understanding and formulating correct plans.
    Why Aren't We "Flying" Forward Anymore?
    To achieve correct leadership, the county committee must not only ensure that policies, plans, and methods come from the practice of the masses, but also return to the practice of the masses for testing, turning experiences proven effective by practice into the actions of the masses, into material wealth. This is what Chairman Mao meant by going from the first leap (from practice to understanding) to the second leap (from understanding to practice), and the second leap is more important. Only with this leap can we achieve the goal of transforming the objective world.
    Regarding the issue of the second leap, our Fufeng County Committee did not have sufficient understanding in the past and took detours.
    In recent years, the county committee has formulated plans for developing agricultural production every year and has also conducted multiple long-term plans to change the overall appearance of agriculture in the county. Most of these plans and programs were formulated after investigation and mobilization of cadres and the masses for discussion, and they could be basically completed as long as subjective efforts were made. However, there were not many years when they were actually completed. At the end of the year, the reasons were often attributed to natural disasters, and there was very little subjective self-examination.
    Leading comrades of the county committee led teams to the countryside to conduct a lot of investigation materials. These investigation materials mostly revealed the practical problems existing in rural work and agricultural production in various periods and put forward relatively practical and feasible solutions. However, after the investigation materials were issued, they were generally circulated as "reference materials" and then left at that. This has made it impossible to realize the correct understanding, assumptions, and plans obtained by the leading comrades of the county committee through hard work in staying at selected spots.
    Why did this happen? I think the main reason is that after we realized the first leap, we didn't "fly" forward anymore, neglecting the more important process of the second leap.
    From an ideological point of view, there are two incorrect understandings. More often, it is believed that "once the county holds a meeting and issues a document, the task is completed, and the implementation is the responsibility of the grassroots." Therefore, after each meeting is held and a document is issued, specific implementation is not immediately organized, and there is little inspection and questioning of the implementation at the grassroots level. Secondly, it is believed that "the things decided at the meeting and the officially issued documents are all completely correct and do not need to be tested and revised. Even if there are problems, it is a matter of urging the grassroots to implement them." Because of this, in some places with special circumstances, when the situation changes, the county committee's plans and resolutions cannot be implemented.
    Obtaining correct understanding, formulating realistic plans, and thinking out correct methods are not the end of our cognitive process. The purpose of communists knowing the world is to transform the world. Having correct understanding and plans, but not turning them into material things, can only be said to have completed half of the task of cognition. Theories, policies, plans, etc., are always mental things before they are realized. To turn them into the actions of the masses and into material wealth, we must do arduous work and pay a considerable price, which is often much greater than obtaining correct understanding and formulating correct plans. We say that once theory is grasped by the masses, it will become a huge material force. This does not mean that the theory itself can naturally become material wealth, but that we must, through a lot of work, specifically organize the broad masses to carry out revolutionary practice. Otherwise, even the best theory is useless.
    Generally speaking, the plans and resolutions made by the county committee, as long as they are investigated, researched, and summarized from the practice of the masses with the proletariat's standpoint and viewpoint, can be said to be roughly correct. However, due to many reasons, either the contradictions of the original objective things have not been fully exposed, and we have not obtained enough materials; or the situation has changed in practice, and part of the understanding is not completely in line with reality, or even part of the understanding is completely wrong, the situation that needs to be changed often exists. To achieve correct leadership, the county committee must never be satisfied with the understanding gained in the first leap, but must take the understanding, plans, and resolutions it has obtained to practice for testing, and constantly modify and supplement them. Only in this way can it be transformed into the actions of the masses and material forces. Take Fufeng's large-scale farmland capital construction as an example. At the beginning of the movement, some plain areas followed the methods of mountainous areas and gully areas and built sloping terraces on a large scale, resulting in many large and flat but uneven lands being transformed into terraced fields. The masses were generally unwilling to do it, and progress was very slow. Later, the county committee adopted the opinions of the masses and decided to build "yanwo di" on a large scale in the plain areas. The masses called these "golden basins" and "rice and noodle jars." The farmland capital construction movement in these areas quickly formed a climax. This issue fully illustrates that our leadership's understanding and plans often have to be repeated many times in practice before they can conform to the law of development of objective things, so that subjective things can become objective things.
    Chairman Mao's theory about the two leaps of cognition, from perceptual cognition to rational cognition, and then from rational cognition to revolutionary practice, is a complete process. Without the second leap after the first leap, not only will we not be able to obtain correct understanding, but we will also fall into the quagmire of idealism. As the county committee, the fighting headquarters of a county, it is not only necessary to be good at putting forward resolutions that are more in line with objective reality, but it is more important to lead and organize the broad masses of cadres and the masses to work hard in practice and turn abstract things in their minds into real things.

### 为什么不再向前“飞”了？

    县委的主要任务是干什么？是把政策、计划交给群众，通过群众，变成物质财富，这就是改造世界。要实现这个“变”，必须做艰苦的工作，付出大量的代价。这个代价往往要比取得正确的认识、制订正确的计划大得多
    为什么不再向前“飞”了？
    县委要实现正确的领导，不仅政策、计划、方法要从群众的实践中来，而且必须回到群众的实践中去加以检验，把实践证明为有效的经验，变为群众的行动，变为物质财富。这就是毛主席所说的，从第一次飞跃（由实践到认识）到第二次飞跃（由认识到实践），而第二次飞跃是更重要的，只有有了这个飞跃，才能实现改造客观世界的目的。
    对于第二次飞跃的问题，我们扶风县委过去认识不够，走过弯路。
    近几年来，县委每年都制订了发展农业生产计划，还搞过多次改变全县农业面貌的远景规划。这些计划、规划，大部分都是经过调查，并发动干部和群众讨论制订的，只要主观上很好努力，基本上可以完成。但是实际完成的年份不多。年终检查，往往把原因推到自然灾害上面，从主观上检查的很少。
    县委领导同志带班子下乡搞了不少调查材料。这些调查材料大部分揭示了各个时期农村工作和农业生产方面存在的实际问题，并提出了比较切实可行的解决措施。但是调查材料发下去后，一般都当作“参考材料”传阅一下了事。这样就使县委领导同志通过蹲点调查辛辛苦苦取得的正确认识、设想、计划，不能得到实现。
    为什么发生这种情况呢？我认为主要原因，在于我们实现了第一次飞跃之后，就再不向前飞了，忽视了第二次飞跃这一更重要的过程。
    从思想上检查，有两种不正确的认识。比较多的时候是认为“县上把会一开，把文件一发，任务就算完成了，贯彻执行是基层的事”。因而在每次召开会议，发出文件之后，不能紧接着组织具体实现，同时对下面贯彻执行的情况检查过问的也少。其次，认为“会上决定的东西，发出的正式文件，都是完全正确的，不需要进行检验修改，即使有问题，也是督促下面贯彻执行的问题”。由于这样，在有些情况特殊的地方，在情况发生变化的时候，县委的计划、决议就贯彻不下去了。
    取得正确的认识，制订出合乎实际的计划，想出正确的方法，并不是我们认识过程的终结。共产党人认识世界的目的是为了改造世界。有了正确的认识和计划，而没有把它变成物质的东西，那只能说完成认识任务的一半。理论、政策、计划等，在没有实现以前，总还是精神的东西。要把它变成群众的行动，变成物质财富，必须做艰苦的工作，付出大量的代价，这个代价往往要比取得正确的认识、制订正确的计划大得多。我们说理论一旦被群众掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量，这绝不是说理论本身能够自然而然地变成物质财富，而是要我们通过大量的工作，具体地组织广大群众进行革命实践。否则再好的理论也是没有用的。
    一般的说来，县委制订的计划，作出的决议，只要是用无产阶级的立场、观点到群众实践中调查研究总结出来的，大致上可以说是正确的。但是由于许多原因，或者原来客观事物的矛盾没有充分暴露，我们得到的材料不够；或者是在实践中情况起了变化，部分认识不完全切合实际，甚至部分认识完全错了，需要改变的情况往往是存在的。县委要实现正确的领导，决不能满足于第一次飞跃所取得的认识，必须把自己所取得的认识，制订的计划，作出的决议，拿到实践中去检验，并不断进行修改、补充。只有这样，才能使之变成群众的行动和物质力量。以扶风大搞农田基本建设为例。运动开始，一些平原地区仿照山区和沟壑地带的办法，大修坡式梯田，结果把许多大平小不平的地修成台田，群众普遍不愿搞，进展很慢。以后县委采纳了群众意见，决定在平原地区大修“堰窝地”，群众称这是“金盆地”，“米面瓦罐”，这些地区的农田基本建设运动迅速形成高潮。这个问题充分说明，我们领导上的认识和计划，往往要在实践中反复多次，才能达到同客观事物发展的规律性相符合，使主观的东西变成客观的东西。
    毛主席关于认识问题由感性认识到理性认识、又由理性认识到革命实践这两次飞跃，是个完整的过程。只有第一次飞跃没有第二次飞跃，不但不能获得正确的认识，而且会陷入唯心主义的泥坑。作为一个县的战斗司令部的县委，不仅要善于提出比较符合客观实际的决议来，更重要的是领导和组织广大干部群众在实践中苦干，把脑子里抽象的东西变成现实的东西。
