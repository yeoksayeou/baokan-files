　　American Aggressor Troops in the Mire
　　While the Johnson government is busy perpetrating "peace" swindles, the American aggressor troops in Vietnam are stepping up military operations on the South Vietnamese battlefield and further expanding their operational areas, venturing into the Mekong Delta for the first time to conduct "sweeps." They are launching a "proactive" offensive into a new area,妄想 hoping this will reverse their embarrassing predicament of being passively beaten. However, the result is that they can barely move an inch and are even more humiliated. An Associated Press report vividly describes the embarrassing plight of the American aggressor troops being passively beaten on this new battlefield. Excerpts and annotations are as follows:
　　The mire is both deep and sticky. Soldiers are constantly walking with their backs bent because of sniper fire.
　　In seven hours, an entire battalion of troops moved only thirty yards (twenty-seven meters). (It took them a whole hour to move just over three meters, truly "寸步难行" 寸步难行 - barely able to move an inch!)
　　This is the Mekong Delta. American paratroopers tasted the Delta for the first time on Sunday.
　　Sergeant Banks, while placing a wounded soldier on a dry patch, pointed to the swamp fifty feet away and said, "That's simply hell." Banks had been wounded by grenade fragments.
　　The Viet Cong had been blocking the path of this battalion all morning. The Americans stood in waist-deep, weedy mire, (This is indeed a mire, but for the American aggressors, the entire South Vietnamese battlefield is a mire, more than waist-deep, it will drown them!) hoping that planes and artillery would drive the Viet Cong out. This is a very slow process.
　　They could see where the Viet Cong were. Lieutenant Colonel Dexter said, "They are there, in that area overgrown with wild sugarcane and bamboo. (This is the green screen.) They are also on both sides of the canals. (Those are natural trenches.)" As he spoke, he looked towards the dikes of the paddy fields. He could tell the Viet Cong were there because he could see the flashes of their guns firing. (The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces are everywhere. The American aggressors can't see people but they are being hit.)
　　Two companies of Dexter's troops had engaged with the enemy who were entrenched and fortified, while another company moved forward. By nightfall, he was trying to decide whether to launch a night attack or retreat to the landing zone and defend it for the night. (A dilemma, indeed a great quandary.)
　　No matter what he does, there will be trouble on Monday, because the Mekong Delta always means trouble.
　　During the Indochina War, the French generally avoided the Delta, and only maintained unobstructed main roads with a series of fortified outposts.
　　Now the Americans have come to this battlefield.
　　Before the beginning of this year, only Vietnamese troops were active in the Delta. But as the Viet Cong's offensive in the Delta intensified, American troops also moved in. It is expected that American troops will soon be active in Long An Province south of Saigon, Jianhe Province and Yongping Province, and in the Ca Mau Peninsula.
　　As the Americans discovered over the weekend, the war in the Delta is a new experience for them. (A new experience of defeat.) Sergeant Banks (who was injured by a Viet Cong hidden in a cave) said: "Fighting here is much better than fighting in the jungle. You can see where you are going and where you came from. You can see the sky and the sun."
　　But the Viet Cong can see these things too, and they know the details of every canal and every dike. On Sunday, snipers suddenly appeared, fired, and disappeared easily. (Truly appearing and disappearing unpredictably.)
　　The fiercest battles in the Vietnam War are mainly fought in the Delta. The neat paddy field dikes and orderly canals provide very good cover for the Viet Cong. (For the South Vietnamese people, mountains and rivers are at their disposal; for the American aggressors, every plant and tree is a potential enemy.)
　　American troops operating in the northern part of the Delta on Sunday found that conventional artillery fire and military aircraft were not enough to defeat the Viet Cong.
　　Armored vehicles were brought in, but the harmful mire and deep canals slowed them down so much that they were far behind schedule that night.
　　The Vietnamese army has always considered fighting in the Delta to be extremely exhausting, with heavy casualties and persistent.
　　As American casualties increased on Sunday, it became clear that in this new battlefield of the Vietnam War, American troops will find the same harsh realities. (Throughout the South Vietnamese battlefield, American aggressor troops are being passively beaten everywhere, as is the case in the old battlefield and the new battlefield. The American aggressors should have understood this "harsh reality" long ago.) (Attached picture)

### 美国侵略军在泥淖中

    美国侵略军在泥淖中
    正在约翰逊政府大搞“和平”骗局的时候，侵越美军在南越战场上加紧军事行动，进一步扩大作战地区，第一次进入湄公河三角洲进行“扫荡”。他们向一个新的地区“主动”出击，妄想这样会扭转自己被动挨打的狼狈处境。但是，结果是寸步难行，更加狼狈。美联社在一篇报道中就颇为生动地写出了美国侵略军在这个新战场上被动挨打的狼狈相。现摘译并加批注发表如下：
    泥淖既深又粘。由于狙击手开枪，士兵们老是弯着腰走路。
    在七个小时中，一整营军队才走了三十码（二十七米）。（一小时好容易才往前挪了三米多，真真是“寸步难行”也。）
    这就是湄公河三角洲。美国伞兵于星期日第一次尝到三角洲的味道。
    班克斯上士一面把伤兵放在一块干地上一面指着五十英尺外的沼泽地说：“那儿简直是地狱。”班克斯曾经被手榴弹片炸伤。
    越共从那天上午就一直拦住这营军队的去路。美国人站在没腰深的长满水草的泥淖中，（这儿固然是一片泥淖，而对美国侵略者来说，整个南越战场都是一个泥淖，岂止没腰，还耍没顶！）指望飞机和大炮把越共赶出来。这是很缓慢的事情。
    他们能够看到越共在什么地方。德克斯特中校说：“他们就在那里，在那块长满野生甘蔗和竹子的地方。（这里是青纱帐）他们还在渠道两岸。（那里是天然壕堑）”他一面说，一面向着长满水稻的稻田的堤坝那边看去。他所以能够说越共就在那里，是因为可以看到对方炮口爆炸冒出的火光。（南越人民武装无所不在。美国侵略者看不见人，却挨得着打。）
    德克斯特的部队有两个连同筑壕固守的敌人发生了接触，另一连向前进。到晚上，他设法决定是发动夜袭还是退到着陆区并在那里守一夜。（进退两难，确实是大费踌躇。）
    不管他怎样做，星期一都要遇到麻烦，因为湄公河三角洲总是意味着麻烦。
    在印度支那战争中，法国人一般是避开这个三角洲，而只是用一系列筑有工事的哨所保持主要公路畅通无阻。
    现在美国人到这个战场来了。
    在今年年初以前，只有越南军队在三角洲活动。但是由于越共在三角洲的攻势日益激烈，所以美军也开进来了。预料美军不久将在西贡以南的隆安省、在建和省和永平省以及在金瓯半岛活动。
    正如美国人在周末所发现的那样，对他们来说，三角洲的战争是一种新的经验。（新的失败的经验。）班克斯上士（他被藏在洞里的一名越共打伤）说：“在这里打仗比在丛林里打仗好多了。你可以看见你将到那里以及你是从那里来的。你可以看到天空和太阳。”
    但是越共也同样看得见这些东西，他们知道每条渠道和每个堤坝的详细情况。星期天，狙击手忽然出现，他们开枪，并且轻而易举地消失了。（真是神出鬼没。）
    越南战争中最激烈的战斗主要是在三角洲打的。整齐的稻田堤坝有条不紊的渠道为越共提供了非常好的掩护。（对南越人民，是山河皆为我用；对美国侵略者，是到处草木皆兵。）
    星期日在三角洲北部活动的美军发现常规炮火和军用飞机不足以击溃越共。
    装甲车运来了，但是害人的泥淖和深深的渠道使得它们行动很慢，以致那天晚上，它们大大落在时间表后面了。
    越南陆军曾经认为，在三角洲战斗是极度的疲劳、伤亡重大和持久性的。
    随着星期日美军伤亡增加，很显然，在越南战争的这个新战场，美军将发现同样的严酷事实。（在整个南越战场上，美国侵略军到处都一样是被动挨打的，老战场如此，新战场也是如此。这样一个“严酷事实”，美国侵略者早该懂得了。）（附图片）
