    Editor’s Note: The news of Yutai County in Shandong Province successfully transforming into rice paddies and largely planting rice is inspiring.
    For a county, the total grain output has increased by more than two times in one year, which can be said to be a great leap. This is the result of the Yutai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their own thinking, arm the minds of the masses, and rely on their own efforts and hard work.
    In the struggle to transform nature, the Yutai County Committee used the method of “one divides into two” to analyze the county’s natural conditions, not only seeing the unfavorable side but also the favorable side. The terrain is low-lying and prone to flooding, which is an unfavorable side; however, the abundance of water can be used to transform the low-lying areas into rice paddies and largely plant rice, which is a favorable side. In the past few years, the people of Yutai have already found a path to build terraced fields, strip fields, and largely transform rice paddies in the struggle to transform nature, but the county committee did not promptly grasp and promote it. After the ideological revolution of the county committee leadership, this matter was earnestly grasped, and the experiences at selected points quickly turned into county-wide wealth.
    What is the greatest difficulty in the struggle to transform nature? Is it the unfavorable natural conditions or the people’s fear of difficulties? The Yutai County Committee believes it is the latter, not the former. In the struggle to transform nature, they gave prominence to politics, vigorously grasped people’s thinking, and used Mao Zedong Thought to open up the spiritual world of the broad masses, daring to struggle and daring to win. This is the decisive factor for Yutai County’s achievements.
    The situation in Yutai County demonstrates the enormous potential for increasing grain production. There are still many old disaster areas and low-yield areas like Yutai in our country. As long as the leading organs in these regions can, like the Yutai County Committee, use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, give prominence to politics, mobilize the masses, and do a good job of people’s ideological work, spirit can be transformed into a huge material force.
    Yutai County, a famous old disaster area in Shandong Province, mobilized the masses for extensive debates and launched a great production revolution. Based on years of flood control efforts, the people of this county have largely transformed low-lying areas and largely planted rice, turning a place that was plagued by floods every year and only harvested one crop of wheat a year into a good place with two crops of wheat and rice. In 1965, the total grain output of the county increased by more than two times compared to 1964, changing from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county.
    Yutai County’s large-scale rice planting is a major change in the farming system and also a great ideological revolution. Throughout the entire process of transforming low-lying areas for rice planting, the struggle between two ideologies was extremely fierce. One is not afraid of difficulties, dares to struggle, and dares to win; the other is conservative and backward, sticks to old ways, and fears difficulties and worries. They said: Yutai is born unlucky, with boundless difficulties; Yutai is born a "reed swamp" and "frog's nest." Faced with the above ideological situation, the county committee took two measures: first, organized cadres and the masses to visit and learn from brother regions and advanced units in the county; second, organized a county-wide debate from top to bottom, speaking extensively about the favorable conditions for developing production in the county. Let cadres and the masses not only see the unfavorable side but also the favorable side, explaining that Yutai has people, land, water, and resources, and is a treasure land for developing production, inspiring everyone to despise difficulties and enhance their confidence in overcoming difficulties.
    The Yutai County Committee first grasped and summarized the experiences of units such as the Zhenzhuang Brigade of the Guting Commune in the county that transformed fields for rice planting, and then organized more than 15,000 cadres and the masses to visit. At the same time as the visit, the county committee raised the following questions and launched a major debate among cadres and the masses throughout the county: “Does Yutai County have a future? Can it turn itself around?” “Is it a complete revolution, becoming the master of nature? Or is it being a slave to nature?” “If the Zhenzhuang Brigade can do it, why can’t other brigades do it?” “Is it to work hard or work little? Is it to do it early or do it late?” Through debate, the revolutionary spirit of not fearing difficulties and daring to struggle was greatly promoted. Cadres who originally complained about "poor conditions" and "backward masses" became those who complained that their revolutionary thought was not strong, and the masses who originally did not believe in their own strength realized that the reason they had not done well before was that "the path was not found accurately and the enthusiasm was not fully utilized."
    After deciding to work hard, some cadres and the masses developed a dependent mentality and thought that if they did too much, they would not be able to do it according to high standards. Therefore, the county committee raised the question "Is it self-reliance? Or is it waiting for support?" "Is it adhering to high standards for transforming fields and planting rice? Or is it low-standard, rough farming and rough planting?" for further debate, further liberating the thinking of cadres and the masses.
    In the process of solving ideological problems, cadres at all levels generally studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"; commune members studied articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", "In Memory of Norman Bethune", and "Serve the People," enabling cadres and the masses to realize that production is revolution, is serving the people, and that doing a good job in production is not only to solve the current eating problem, but also to create a family business for future generations, build socialism, and support the world revolution.
    Spirit has become a powerful material force. From the winter of 1964 to the spring of 1965, the people of Yutai launched an unprecedented upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction to transform fields for rice planting. They contributed more than 2.8 million labor days, built more than 7,000 four-level canals with a total length of more than 2,700 kilometers, and built more than 3,000 canal system structures, increasing drainage and irrigation areas by more than 400,000 mu each; in addition, some mechanical or electric drainage and irrigation stations were added. Yutai County is a low-lying plain, lacking building materials. They organized more than 3,000 people, 2,000 handcarts, and 400 sailboats to transport mountain stones from Teng County, Weishan County, and other counties; in addition, they established more than 40 brick kilns and lime kilns on their own. The construction sites were even more bustling with activity, with slogans such as "Build water conservancy, eliminate water damage," "Build canals, plant rice," and "Learn from Jiangnan, catch up with Jiangnan" posted everywhere. Commune members wrote on big-character posters: "Cold weather cannot cool hot hearts, frozen ground cannot freeze determination, wind cannot blow away perseverance, hard stones cannot be harder than unity."
    Last year, the county committee's original plan was to plant 150,000 mu of rice. The commune members throughout the county were very enthusiastic about transforming fields and planting rice. The plan was repeatedly broken through, and finally 350,000 mu were planted. Although it was relatively dry in the early stage, and there was a heavy rain of 200 millimeters in early July, the rice still achieved a good harvest. The newly built terraced fields and strip fields also increased production.

    用毛泽东思想武装广大干部和群众
    鱼台县思想大革命推动生产大飞跃
    运用一分为二的方法分析自然条件，大改水田大种水稻成功，由缺粮县变为余粮县
    编者按：山东省鱼台县大改水田大种水稻成功的消息，读了令人振奋。
    一个县，粮食总产量在一年之内跃增两倍以上，可以说是一个大飞跃。这是中共鱼台县委运用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想、武装群众头脑，自力更生、艰苦奋斗的结果。
    在改造自然的斗争中，鱼台县委运用一分为二的方法，分析本县的自然条件，不但看到不利的一面，也看到有利的一面。地势低洼，常闹水灾，这是不利的一面；但是水多，可以把洼地改成水田，大种水稻，这又是有利的一面。几年来，鱼台人民在改造自然的斗争中，已经找到了一条大修台田、条田和大改稻田的道路，但是县委没有及时抓紧推广。经过县委领导思想革命化，认真抓紧了这件事情，点上的经验迅速变成了面上的财富。
    在改造自然斗争中的最大困难是什么呢？是不利的自然条件，还是人们害怕困难的思想？鱼台县委认为是后者，而不是前者。他们在改造自然的斗争中，突出政治，大抓人的思想，用毛泽东思想打开了广大群众敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神世界。这是鱼台县所以取得成绩的决定因素。
    鱼台县的情况，说明了粮食增产的巨大潜力。我国还有不少象鱼台一样的老灾区、低产区。这些地区的领导机关，只要能够象鱼台县委一样，用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，发动群众，做好人的思想工作，精神就可以变成巨大的物质力量。
    山东省著名的老灾区鱼台县发动群众大辩大论，进行了一场生产大革命。这个县的人民在历年治涝斗争的基础上，大改洼地，大种水稻，把一个年年洪水为害，一年只收一季小麦的苦地方，改成了麦稻两熟的好地方。一九六五年全县粮食总产量比一九六四年跃增两倍以上，由缺粮县变成了余粮县。
    鱼台县大种水稻，是耕作制度的大变革，也是一场思想大革命。在整个改造洼地种稻的过程中，两种思想的斗争是十分激烈的。一种是不怕困难，敢于斗争，敢于胜利；一种是保守落后，因循守旧，畏难发愁。他们说：鱼台命苦，困难无边；鱼台是生就的“芦苇滩”，“蛙子窠”。面对以上思想状况，县委采取了两个措施：一是组织干部、群众到兄弟地区和本县的先进单位参观学习；一是从上到下组织了全民大辩论，大讲这个县发展生产的有利条件。让干部、群众不仅看到不利的一面，也看到有利的一面，说明鱼台有人，有地，有水，有资源，是发展生产的宝地，启发大家藐视困难，增强战胜困难的信心。
    鱼台县委首先抓紧对本县改田种稻的谷亭公社甄庄大队等单位的经验作了总结，接着组织干部、群众一万五千多人去参观。在参观的同时，县委提出下面几个问题，在全县干部、群众中展开大辩论：“鱼台县有没有前途？能不能翻身？”“是彻底革命，当大自然的主人？还是当大自然的奴隶？”“甄庄大队能办到的事情，为什么别的大队就不能办到？”“是大干还是小干？是早干还是晚干？”经过辩论，不怕困难，敢于斗争的革命精神大大发扬，原来怨“条件不好”、“群众落后”的干部，变成了怨自己革命思想不振，原来不相信自己力量的群众，知道了以前没搞好是“路子没找准，干劲没使足”。
    在决定大干之后，部分干部、群众中又产生了依赖思想和搞多了就不能按高标准搞好的思想。于是，县委又提出“是自力更生？还是坐等支援？”“是坚持高标准改田种稻？还是低标准粗耕粗种？”再进行辩论，进一步解放了干部、群众的思想。
    在解决思想问题的过程中，各级干部普遍学习了《为人民服务》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等文章；社员群众学习了《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》等文章，使干部、群众认识到生产就是革命，就是为人民服务，搞好生产不仅是解决当前的吃饭问题，而是要为子孙创家立业，建设社会主义和支持世界革命。
    精神变成了强大的物质力量。一九六四年冬到一九六五年春，鱼台人为改田种稻掀起了空前的农田水利建设高潮。他们付出了二百八十多万个劳动工日，修成了总长二千七百多公里的四级渠道七千多条，修建渠系建筑物三千多处，增加排涝面积和灌溉面积各四十多万亩；另外又增建了一些机械或电力的排灌站。鱼台县是一片低洼平原，缺乏建筑材料。他们就组织了三千多人、两千辆地排车和四百只帆船，远到滕县、微山等县去采运山石；另外还自办了四十多个砖窑和石灰窑。各个工地上更是热火朝天，到处贴着“兴水利、除水害”、“修渠道、种水稻”、“学江南、赶江南”等标语。社员在大字报上写着：“天冷冷不了热心，地冻冻不了决心，风吹吹不动恒心，石硬硬不过齐心。”
    去年，县委原订的种稻计划是十五万亩，全县社员对改田种稻的热情很高，计划一再突破，最后种了三十五万亩。虽然前期较旱，七月初又连降了二百毫米大雨，但水稻仍然获得了较好的收成。新修的台田和条田也增了产。
