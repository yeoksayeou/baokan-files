    Always Be Ready to Annihilate All Invading Enemies
    Wu Jiaxi, Deputy Artillery Officer of the "Fierce Tiger Boat" of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Navy
    The Spring Festival is here, and we are filled with boundless joy, celebrating this traditional festival of the Chinese people together with the people of the whole country.
    We are revolutionary soldiers educated and nurtured by Chairman Mao. To defend the socialist construction of our motherland and to safeguard world peace is our sacred duty. On the night of November 13th last year, Chiang Kai-shek bandit naval vessels intruded into our fishing grounds east of Chongwu, disrupting the production of our fishermen. After we received the order from our superiors, the flames of anger at the enemy ignited in the hearts of all the comrades on our boat, and the warship, as if having grown wings, sped quickly to the fishing grounds east of Chongwu. Under the fierce artillery fire of our boat and our brother boats, we achieved a significant victory by sinking one enemy vessel and damaging another.
    The victory of this naval battle is a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. We deeply realize that only by firmly remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, fully preparing ideologically and militarily, and always being ready for battle, can we be able to move out immediately at the first order and annihilate all enemies who dare to invade. At the same time, we also realize that to eliminate the enemy, we must, as instructed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, develop superb skills in killing the enemy. In peacetime, the various combat positions on our boat have launched a surge of pre-battle training. Each time we go to sea, no matter how strong the wind or how high the waves, they cannot stop our determination to train. The comrades all deeply realize that only in raging waves can we develop truly superb skills in killing the enemy. We not only practice night combat skills at night, but also create conditions during the day to conduct night training. The comrades all blindfold themselves with thick cloth and repeatedly practice training subjects urgently needed in wartime. Now, the comrades in the engine room department, in complex situations, can close their eyes and, by touching and listening, can judge the operating conditions of the machinery.
    Currently, in order to salvage its defeat in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is constantly expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina, and is attempting to impose the war on the people of our country. Under this situation, our entire boat will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the five principles of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, and regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives, firmly establish the idea of constant preparedness without slackening, strictly guard our combat posts, strengthen war preparedness, always be ready to eliminate all enemies who dare to invade, resolutely complete the tasks of protecting fisheries and escorting assigned to us by the Party and the people, and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, the sacred territory of our motherland, for the defense of the socialist construction of our great motherland, and for the defense of world peace!

    时刻准备歼灭一切来犯的敌人
    解放军海军某部“猛虎艇”副炮长  吴加溪
    春节来到了，我们满怀无限的喜悦，和全国人民一起，欢度我国人民这个传统节日。
    我们是毛主席教育成长起来的革命战士。保卫祖国社会主义建设，保卫世界和平是我们的神圣职责。去年十一月十三日夜晚，蒋帮海盗军舰窜扰我崇武以东渔场，破坏我渔民生产。当我们接到上级的命令以后，我们全艇同志心中燃起杀敌的怒火，战艇象长了翅膀一样，飞快地赶到崇武以东渔场。在我们和兄弟战艇猛烈炮火的打击下，取得了击沉击伤敌舰各一艘的重大胜利。
    这次海战的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们深深体会，只有牢记毛主席的教导，充分做好思想准备和战斗准备，时刻准备打仗，才能作到一声令下，立即出动，歼灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。同时，我们也体会到，要消灭敌人，必须按照林彪副主席所指示的，练出过硬的杀敌本领。平时，我们艇各个战位掀起了敌前练兵的热潮。每次出海，不管风再大，浪再高，都挡不住我们练兵的决心。同志们都深刻认识到，只有在惊涛骇浪中才能练出真正过硬的杀敌本领。我们不仅在夜间练夜战本领，还在白天制造条件进行夜间训练。同志们都用厚布把眼睛蒙住，反复操练战时急需的训练科目。现在轮机部门的同志，在复杂的情况下，都能闭上眼睛，凭着手摸、耳听，就可以判断出机器运转情况。
    目前，美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的败局，正在不断扩大侵略越南和印度支那的战争，并且企图把战争强加在我国人民头上。在这种形势下，我们全艇一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻林彪副主席的五项原则，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，牢固地树立常备不懈的思想，严守战斗岗位，加强战备，时刻准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人，坚决完成党和人民交给我们的护渔护航任务，为解放祖国神圣领土台湾，保卫伟大祖国的社会主义建设，保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
