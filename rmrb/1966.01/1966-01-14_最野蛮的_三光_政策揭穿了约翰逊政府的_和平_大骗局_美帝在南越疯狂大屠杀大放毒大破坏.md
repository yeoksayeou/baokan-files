    The most savage "Three Alls" policy exposes the Johnson administration's "peace" hoax.
    The American imperialists frantically massacre, release poison, and destroy in South Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th—While the Johnson administration has been using deceptive tactics to play the "peace talks" hoax since the end of last year, it has intensified "sweeps" in South Vietnam, using the most savage fascist means to carry out massacres, poisonings, and destruction on a massive scale.
    After Washington announced its so-called "Fourteen Points" proposal regarding the "peace talks" hoax on December 28th last year, the American aggressor troops in South Vietnam launched "sweeps" on a larger and more frequent scale than before. The U.S. 1st Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, Marine Corps, as well as puppet troops from South Korea, Australia, and the South Vietnamese puppet army, were dispatched on a large scale to launch major offensives against the liberated areas in provinces such as Di An, Xin An, Bình Định, Biên Hòa, and areas near Bo Lai Mei and Da Nang. An important feature of these "sweeps" is the implementation of the inhumane policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all" against many residential areas in South Vietnam. According to a dispatch from Saigon by the Associated Press on January 6th, the American aggressor troops began implementing this plan on January 1st. "This extensive plan includes establishing arbitrary bombing zones in Viet Cong areas, destroying rice crops and burning other crops and housing in enemy areas." During the "sweep" west of Saigon, the American aggressor troops "turned every building into rubble," "rounded up everyone they could find," and "burned and destroyed everything edible and habitable." When the U.S. Marine Corps "swept" southwest of Da Nang in Quang Nam Province, they also "burned to rubble" a village called Vinh Phuong.
    Since the end of last year, the American aggressor troops have used poison gas on an unprecedented scale in South Vietnam. The United States and its puppet troops used large amounts of poison gas continuously during the eight-day "sweep" in Xin An and Di An provinces. American bandits dropped bundles of poison gas grenades from low-flying aircraft and also distributed these poison gas grenades to ground troops for use. During the "largest" "sweep" launched by 8,000 American troops and puppet troops on January 1st in the "Iron Triangle" area northwest of Saigon, poison gas bombs were even thrown at women, children, and the elderly.
    When the South Korean puppet troops, who were vassals of the American aggressors, were "sweeping" the Tuy Hòa area in Phu Yen Province on January 4th, the American bandits dropped poison gas bombs from aircraft. South Korean puppet troops also released poison gas into tunnels.
    Recently, the American aggressors have also been constantly dispatching aircraft to scatter chemical poisons on a large scale in residential areas of South Vietnam. On December 28th last year, American aircraft scattered chemical poisons in Can Tho Province, poisoning 4,000 people and destroying crops on more than 10,000 hectares of land.
    In the three days from January 1st to 3rd this year, American aircraft successively scattered chemical poisons over large areas of Vinh Long Province and Sa Dec Province, poisoning many residents and withering large areas of crops. On December 27th last year, American aircraft also scattered chemical poisons in Long Hai Township, Ba Ria Province.
    Recently, American bandit aircraft have been dispatched daily in sorties of three to four hundred, wantonly bombing and blasting villages and residential areas in South Vietnam. According to U.S. news agencies, in just four days, January 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th this year, American aircraft destroyed or damaged 2,280 civilian houses and sank 78 civilian ships. On January 8th, American bandit aircraft wantonly bombed and launched rockets at the "Thuan Phong" passenger ship en route from Thu Dau Mot to Dau Tieng, sinking the ship and killing more than 200 innocent passengers. American B-52 strategic bombers flying from Guam have also recently conducted "carpet" bombing of provinces such as Quang Tri, Tay Ninh, Di An, and Xin An. From December 30th last year to January 6th this year, American B-52 aircraft raided Tay Ninh Province three times at night.
    Each of these "sweeps" by the American aggressor troops ended in failure. But the towering crimes they have committed in South Vietnam show that the American imperialists are even more brutal than the Hitler bandits.
    This newspaper reports that, according to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, after the American bandits broke into the Chu Lai area in May of last year, they committed all kinds of evil deeds, killing, arson, raping, and plundering. According to extremely incomplete statistics, American bandits have already killed and wounded more than 300 local residents for no reason, imprisoned more than 200 people, and raped hundreds of women, of whom 20 women were gang-raped to death by American bandits. American bandits also set fire to more than 1,500 civilian houses, destroyed 1,500 hectares of crops and many fishing boats and nets, and robbed many livestock and rice.
    As soon as the American bandits arrived in Chu Lai, they immediately demolished more than 500 civilian houses in Cam Nghia Township, drove these innocent farmers to extremely hot sand dunes, and seized 1,500 hectares of land in the township to build military bases. Sweet potatoes, cassava, and other crops that were about to be harvested were also trampled. Four hungry farmers who went back to forage for food were shot dead by American bandits, with three fatalities.
    According to incomplete statistics for five months, American bandit aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, conducted nearly 1,000 wanton bombings in areas such as Tam Ky, dropping more than 10,000 bombs and napalm bombs, and launching many rockets. In Tam Hiep Township alone, American bandits dropped 5,000 bombs in 13 days.
    The U.S. Marine Corps launched more than 100 "sweeps" against Ky Hoa, Ky Xuan, Ky Sinh, Ky Chanh, and other townships, each "sweep" involving one company to four battalions of U.S. troops. American beasts also threw grenades into farmers' air-raid shelters, killing many farmers. They also buried alive twelve children aged eleven to seventeen who had been captured in Chu Lai.
    In Ky Lien Township alone, American beasts raped 206 women.
    The towering crimes and accumulated blood debts committed by American bandits in Chu Lai have aroused strong anger and infinite hatred among the people in the Chu Lai area. The people of Chu Lai are now preparing to respond to the American aggressors with heavier blows.

    最野蛮的“三光”政策揭穿了约翰逊政府的“和平”大骗局
    美帝在南越疯狂大屠杀大放毒大破坏
    新华社十二日讯　约翰逊政府去年底以来在用迷惑人的手法耍弄“和谈”骗局的同时，在越南南方却加强“扫荡”，用最野蛮的法西斯手段，实行大屠杀、大放毒和大破坏。
    在华盛顿去年十二月二十八日公布关于“和谈”骗局的所谓“十四点”主张之后，在南越的美国侵略军展开了比以前规模更大、更频繁的“扫荡”。美国第一步兵师、第一骑兵师、海军陆战队以及南朝鲜、澳大利亚等仆从军队和南越伪军，大规模出动，先后在堤岸、新安、平定、边和等省和波来梅、岘港附近等地区大举进攻解放区。这些“扫荡”的一个重要特点就是对南越的许多居民区实行“杀光、烧光、毁光”的灭绝人性的政策。据美联社一月六日从西贡发出的消息透露，美国侵略军从一月一日就开始执行这项计划了。“这项广泛的计划包括在越共地区建立任意轰炸区、毁掉敌区的大米庄稼和烧毁其它庄稼以及住房。”美国侵略军在西贡以西的“扫荡”中“使每座建筑物都成为瓦砾”，“兜捕他们能够找到的所有的人”，“把能吃的东西和能住的地方全都烧掉毁掉”。美国海军陆战队在广南省岘港西南面“扫荡”时，也把一个名叫荣芳的村庄“烧成瓦砾”。
    美国侵略军从去年年底以来，空前大规模地在南越使用毒气。美国和它的仆从军在新安、堤岸两省的八天“扫荡”中，连续大量使用毒气。美国强盗从低空飞行的飞机上丢下一束束的毒气手榴弹，而且还把这种毒气手榴弹发给地面部队使用。八千名美国军队和仆从军一月一日在西贡西北的“铁三角”地区发动的“规模最大”的“扫荡”中，甚至向妇女、儿童和老人也投掷毒气弹。
    当美国侵略者的仆从南朝鲜军队一月四日在富安省的绥和地区“扫荡”时，美国强盗从飞机上扔下毒气弹。南朝鲜仆从军还向地道施放毒气。
    美国侵略者最近期间，还不断派遣飞机在南越居民区大量撒放化学毒药。去年十二月二十八日，美国飞机在芹苴省撒放化学毒药，使四千人中毒，一万多公顷土地的庄稼被毁坏。
    今年一月一日到三日的三天中，美国飞机又接连向永隆省和沙沥省的广大地区撒放化学毒药，使许多居民中毒和大片庄稼枯萎。去年十二月二十七日，美国飞机也曾向巴地省隆海乡撒放了化学毒药。
    美国强盗飞机，最近以来每天出动三、四百架次，向南越的村庄和居民区狂轰滥炸。据美国通讯社透露，仅在今年一月五日、六日、七日和九日四天，美国飞机就炸毁炸坏民房二千二百八十所，炸沉民船七十八艘。一月八日，美国强盗飞机向正在从土龙木开往油汀的“顺丰”号客轮滥施轰炸和发射火箭，炸沉了这艘船，杀害了二百多名无辜旅客。从关岛起飞的美国B—52型战略轰炸机，最近也向广治、西宁、堤岸、新安等省进行“地毡式”轰炸。在去年十二月三十日至今年一月六日，美国B—52飞机就三次夜袭了西宁省。
    美国侵略军的这些“扫荡”每次都是以失败告终。但是他们在南越犯下的滔天罪行表明，美帝国主义者比希特勒匪徒更残暴。
    本报讯　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美国强盗在去年五月间闯到朱莱地区后，在当地杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，无恶不作。据极不完全统计，美国强盗已经无缘无故地打死打伤三百多个当地居民，囚禁了二百多人，强奸了几百个妇女，其中有二十个妇女被美国强盗轮奸至死。美国强盗还纵火烧毁民房一千五百多间，毁坏了一千五百公顷庄稼和许多渔船、渔网，并抢走许多牲畜和稻谷。
    美国强盗一到朱莱，就立即拆毁了甘义乡五百多家的民房，把这些无辜农民驱赶到炙热无比的沙丘上，并在该乡占夺了一千五百公顷土地来修筑军事基地。地上将到收获期的白薯、木薯等也全被糟踏。有四个饥饿的农民回去觅食，竟被美国强盗开枪打死三人。
    据五个月的不完全统计，包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的美国强盗飞机仅在三岐等地就进行了将近一千次狂轰滥炸，投下了一万多颗炸弹、凝固汽油弹，并发射了许多火箭。仅在三协乡，美国强盗在十三天之中就投下五千颗炸弹。
    美国海军陆战队向奇和、奇春、奇生、奇正等乡发动了一百多次“扫荡”，每次“扫荡”出动美军一个连至四个营。美国兽兵还把手榴弹扔进农民的防空洞里，炸死许多农民。他们还把被抓来的十二个从十一岁至十七岁的孩子活埋在朱莱。
    仅在奇莲乡，美国兽兵就强奸了二百零六个妇女。
    美国强盗在朱莱犯下的滔天罪行和欠下的累累血债，激起朱莱地区人民强烈的愤怒和无比仇恨。朱莱人民现在正准备以更沉重地打击来回答美国侵略者。
