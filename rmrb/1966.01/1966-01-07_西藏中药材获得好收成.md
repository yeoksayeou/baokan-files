    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tibetan herbal medicines achieved the best harvest since the democratic reform last year. At present, commercial departments have purchased more than 300,000 jin of various Chinese herbal medicines, exceeding the planned purchase by 40 percent, which is the largest purchase in history.
    The state purchase plans for precious medicinal materials such as musk, Moutan bark, and caterpillar fungus were all overfulfilled last year. Among them, more than 23,000 liang of musk were purchased, and Moutan bark increased by one and a half times compared with 1964. The medicinal materials sold by farmers and herdsmen also include deer antler, leopard bones, and bear bile.
    Tibet is exceptionally rich in medicinal material resources, of which there are 46 kinds of medicinal plants with great uses and high economic value, and the reserves are large.
    In order to increase the income of emancipated farmers and herdsmen, the People's Government has taken various measures to support farmers and herdsmen in collecting medicinal materials after the democratic reform and has increased the purchase price of medicinal materials. Now, medicinal material production has become an important way for farmers and herdsmen to develop diversified operations and increase their income. From 1960 to now, the income obtained by emancipated farmers and herdsmen from selling medicinal materials has reached more than 11 million yuan.

    西藏中药材获得好收成
    据新华社讯　西藏中药材去年获得民主改革以来最好的收成。目前商业部门收购的各种中药材已有三十多万斤，超过预定收购计划的百分之四十，是历年来收购最多的一年。
    名贵药材麝香、丹皮、虫草去年都超额完成了国家收购的计划。其中麝香共收购二万三千多两，丹皮比一九六四年增加一倍半。农牧民出售的药材中，还有鹿茸、豹骨、熊胆等。
    西藏的药材资源异常丰富，其中用途大、经济价值高的药用植物就有四十六种，而且蕴藏量大。
    为使翻身农牧民增加收入，民主改革后人民政府采取各种措施来扶持农牧民采集药材，并且提高了药材的收购价格。现在，药材生产已经成为农牧民发展多种经营、增加收入的一个重要途径。从一九六○年到现在，翻身农牧民以出售药材得到的收入已达一千一百多万元。
