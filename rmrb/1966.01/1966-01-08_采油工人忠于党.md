    Oil Workers Loyal to the Party
        (With another poem)
    Daqing Oilfield Oil Worker
      Wang Chengjun
    Night falls on the wilderness, the blue, crystalline sky is bright with stars, thousands of pipelines and tens of thousands of lights stretch out as far as the eye can see. A gust of night wind carries the scent of oil, and the sounds of battle songs are especially loud. We fight at our posts, working day and night for the oil. The patrol inspection leaves the duty room, the "Four Alikes" are never forgotten, working day and night is all the same, oil workers are loyal to the Party.

    We are the petroleum field army, we are the petroleum field army, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advancing forward; with a global perspective and the motherland in our hearts, we are wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution. We are the petroleum field army, arrayed on the wilderness; there are roads to the sky and gates to the earth, oil wells like stars, and derricks become forests. The petroleum army advances forward, and the sound of songs rises high into the clouds: We workers have strength, building the motherland and making contributions.

    采油工人忠于党
        （外一首）
    大庆油田采油工人
      王成俊夜幕降临在荒原上，蓝晶晶的天上星星亮，地上千条管线万盏灯，望不到头儿在那方。阵阵夜风送油香，声声战歌格外响，我们战斗在岗位上，夜以继日为油忙。巡回检查走出值班房，
  “四个一样”永不忘，日夜工作一个样，采油工人忠于党。我们是石油野战军我们是石油野战军，高举毛泽东思想红旗向
  前进；放眼世界，胸怀祖国，忠心耿耿为革命。我们是石油野战军，荒原上摆开阵；上天有路，入地有门，油井如星星，井架成了
  林。石油大军向前进，阵阵歌声高入云：咱们工人有力量，建设祖国立功勋。
