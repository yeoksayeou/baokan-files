    Socialist Culture Room—A Position for Propagating Mao Zedong Thought
    Editor's Note: The task of rural cultural rooms is, first and foremost, to organize the study of Chairman Mao's works, publicize Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time, carry out other recreational activities. The following two short articles discuss the心得 (xinde, insights gained) after participating in the study of Chairman Mao's works in the cultural room. These two articles from commune members vividly reflect that to build a new countryside and run socialist cultural rooms well, it is necessary to highlight politics and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle.
    
    Herding Sheep for the Revolution
    Zhang Yutang, Poor Peasant Shepherd of the Dashugou Production Team, Dingxi County, Gansu Province
    Before liberation, my family was very poor. Since I was a child, I herded sheep and cattle and did odd jobs for the landlord. After liberation, I stood up and became my own master.
    The Dashugou Socialist Culture Room was established, and I participated in its activities. I not only learned to read and write but also read Chairman Mao's books. After reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I was deeply moved. I thought: Bethune was a Canadian, he came to China from thousands of miles away to help us fight the Japanese devils, and even sacrificed his life. I should learn from him and be sure to herd the sheep well. At that time, the team's sheep were very thin, so I used my own potatoes and noodle soup to feed the weak sheep. Later, after studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Serve the People" in the cultural room, I felt even brighter in my heart. I thought: After studying Chairman Mao's works, I should worry about herding the sheep well. If we poor and lower-middle peasants don't take the lead, who will? Last May, it was constantly windy and rainy. The team didn't have a sheepfold, so we borrowed a dilapidated cave from a commune member to keep the sheep. I was afraid the cave would collapse and cause danger. I discussed it with my wife, and we tore down our old house and used the wood to build a sheepfold. The production team wanted to give me work points, but I said, "I don't want them. This little thing is nothing, it's far from what Comrade Bethune did!"
    Now my enthusiasm for learning is even greater. At night, I study Chairman Mao's works and listen to the newspaper being read. During the day, when I herd sheep, I also bring a book and study while herding. When I encounter characters I don't recognize, I ask people. I not only want to be able to read them but also to understand their meaning and use them in production. After participating in the study, I learned about the Party's policies and major national events, understood many important principles, became clear-minded and bright-eyed, my thinking improved, and I became more enthusiastic about production.

    社会主义文化室——是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地
    编者按：农村文化室的任务，首先是组织毛主席著作的学习，宣传毛泽东思想，同时展开其它文娱活动。下面发表的两篇短文，谈的是参加文化室学习毛主席著作后的心得。从这两篇社员的文章里，生动地反映出建设新的农村、要办好社会主义文化室，必须突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    为革命放羊
    甘肃定西县大树沟生产队贫农放牧员　张玉堂
    解放以前，我家里很穷。我从小就给地主放羊、放牛，做杂活。解放后，翻身作了主人。
    大树沟成立了社会主义文化室，我参加了文化室的活动。不但学文化，还读毛主席的书。当我读了《纪念白求恩》以后，很受感动。我想：白求恩是加拿大人，他不远万里来到中国，帮助咱们打日本鬼子，还牺牲了生命，我应该向他学习，一定要把羊放好。当时，队上的羊很瘦，我就拿自己的洋芋和面汤喂乏羊。后来，在文化室里又学习了《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》，心里越发亮堂了。我想：学习了毛主席著作，就要操心把羊放好，咱贫下中农不带头，叫谁带头哩。去年五月里，不住的刮风下雨，队上没有羊圈，借了社员的一眼破窑洞圈羊，我怕窑洞塌，出危险。就和老婆商量，把自己的一间旧房拆掉，用拆下来的木料盖了个羊圈。生产队里要给我记工，我说：“我不要，这点事情算个啥，比起白求恩同志还差远哩！”
    现在我的学习劲头更大了。晚上学习毛主席著作，听读报；白天放羊时还带上书，一边放羊，一边学。遇到不认识的字，就问人，不但要念会，还要知道它的意思，用在生产上。参加学习后，知道了党的方针政策和国家大事，懂得了许多大道理，心明眼亮了，思想进步了，搞起生产也就起劲了。
