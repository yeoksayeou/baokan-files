    Furnace-Side Forger
    Li Shanqing, Worker at Changchun Automotive Company
    The forging hammer thunders, shaking the nine heavens,
    Sparks fly, illuminating the sky red,
    Steam and smoke billow before the furnace,
    People cheer and horses neigh, stirring up waves.
    Stirring up waves, spirits high!
    We forgers have broad minds and hearts like fire,
    Sweat pours down like rain,
    Blackened red shoulders connected to iron arms,
    Grasping the great hammer with unwavering will:
    When facing difficulties, we charge and rush, stomping them underfoot,
    When facing crucial moments, we strike hard and fiercely pound;
    On the anvil, how many steel flowers bloom brilliantly,
    Look at the furnace, smoke and fire soar like dragons and tigers!
    If you ask where the drive comes from,
    Look—
    Chairman's quotations hang before the furnace,
    Every word carved in our hearts like a lamp!
    Carved in our hearts, illuminating like a lamp,
    Our revolutionary stance stands firm;
    The falling hammer sounds like spring thunder,
    The rising hammer is like unleashing a storm.
    Red hearts and skillful hands, everyone praises us,
    They all commend our forged pieces are good!
    Ah, good forged pieces, forged pieces are good,
    Tempered hundreds of times, burned thousands of times,
    Thunder and lightning cannot destroy them,
    Wind and rain cannot bend their backs!
    The revolutionary automobile is fitted with them,
    Climbing mountains and crossing ranges, the whistle sounds high,
    The wheels of the era roll forward forever,
    Not giving up even in the face of knives and seas!

    炉前锻工
    长春汽车公司工人  李善庆
    锻锤冬冬震九霄，
    火花飞舞照天烧，
    炉前腾腾烟雾滚，
    人欢马啸掀浪潮。
    掀浪潮，干劲高！
    咱锻工胸怀宽广心如火，
    身上汗水似雨浇，
    黑红的肩膀连铁臂，
    手握大锤志不摇：
    遇困难，猛冲猛闯脚下踩，
    遇关键，猛打猛擂狠狠敲；
    铁钻上，多少钢花烂熳开，
    瞅炉前，烟火飞腾龙虎跃！
    要问干劲哪里来，
    看——
    主席语录炉前挂，
    字字如灯心上雕！
    心上雕，如灯照，
    革命立场站得牢；
    落锤好比春雷响，
    扬锤好比掀风暴。
    心红手巧人人赞，
    都夸咱的锻件好！
    啊，好锻件，锻件好，
    经百锻，经千烧，
    雷轰电击摧不毁，
    风吹雨打不弯腰！
    革命汽车装上它，
    爬山越岭笛声高，
    时代的车轮永向前呵，
    刀山大海不抛锚！
