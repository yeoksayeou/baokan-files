    Earnestly Undertake a Great Cause
    Huma County is located on the southern bank of the Heilong River, in the northernmost part of our motherland. Over the past decade or so, the revolutionary and construction undertakings here have developed, but compared with the requirements of the Party and fraternal regions, our work is far behind. The fundamental problem is that the county committee leadership lacks the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and has long been limited to a state of passively guarding the stall.
    Communists engage in revolution with the aim of transforming society and nature, and this requires revolutionary ambition and the use of this spirit to lead the broad masses of the people. Our county is a sparsely populated mountainous area with abundant resources, large tracts of wasteland available for development, suitable for developing animal husbandry, and great potential for cultivation. Faced with these favorable conditions, if we can invigorate the revolutionary spirit and fully mobilize the masses, we can create enormous wealth and further improve the living standards of the people. Last year, through the Socialist Education Movement, the socialist consciousness and construction enthusiasm of the masses greatly increased. The autumn harvest and threshing throughout the county were of better quality than in previous years, and were completed half a month ahead of schedule. At the same time as the autumn harvest, many communes built water conservancy projects. After finishing threshing, the San Ka Brigade of the San Ka Commune mobilized a large number of laborers to break ice and dig soil in the severe cold of half a foot of snow to repair a fourteen-li-long embankment. The employees and residents of Huma Town worked together to straighten out the ten-odd long streets running vertically and horizontally throughout the city and planted pine and poplar trees, giving it a completely new look. These facts show that there are only backward leaders, not backward masses.
    The development of our construction undertakings here has broad prospects. The key lies in the revolutionization of the county committee leadership. I firmly believe that when the banner is raised high, the morale of the soldiers will inevitably be greatly boosted. The thorough revolutionization of the county committee leadership means that, first of all, the Standing Committee comrades must criticize the old ideological consciousness in their own minds and establish a spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution; they must truly step out of the office, go deep among the masses, personally participate in labor, and earnestly undertake a great cause.

    切实做出一番事业
    呼玛县处于祖国北极——黑龙江南岸的边疆。十多年来，这里的革命和建设事业有了发展，但是和党的要求与兄弟地区比较，我们的工作相差很远。根本问题是县委领导缺乏无产阶级的革命气派，长期以来，限于消极守摊子的状态。
    共产党人搞革命，目的是改造社会、改造自然，而这必须要有革命的雄心大志，并且用这种精神去领导广大人民群众。我们县是地广人稀的山区，资源丰富，有大片荒源可供开发，适于发展畜牧业，耕作潜力很大。面对这些有利条件，如果我们能振作革命精神，充分发动群众，那么就可以创造出巨大的财富，可以把人民群众的生活水平进一步提高。去年经过社会主义教育运动，群众的社会主义觉悟和建设积极性大为高涨，全县秋收脱谷都比之往年质量好，还提前半月完成。在秋收的同时，许多公社都兴修了水利工程。三卡公社三卡大队结束打场以后，就在雪深半尺的严寒下，出动大批劳力钻石刨土，整修十四华里长的堤坝。呼玛镇职工居民一齐动手，把全城横竖十来条长街整修得笔直，还栽满了松树和白杨，面貌焕然一新。这些事实说明，只有落后的领导，没有落后的群众。
    我们这里建设事业的发展有广阔前途，关键就在于县委领导的革命化。我深信，帅旗高举，士气必然大振。县委领导的彻底革命化，首先是常委同志要批判自己思想上的旧的思想意识，树立起一心为革命的精神；要真正走出办公室，深入到群众中去，亲身参加劳动，切切实实地去做出一番事业来。
