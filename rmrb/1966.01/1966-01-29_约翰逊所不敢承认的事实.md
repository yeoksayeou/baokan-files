    Johnson boasted in his economic report that America's "price stability remains the general rule," and tried his best to conceal the increasingly serious inflation in the United States. However, an article published in the January 24th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" exposed Johnson's lies and myths. It admitted: "Despite official assurances that America is enjoying 'price stability,' the prices of everything continue to rise slowly but steadily. In terms of the purchasing power of ten years ago, a dollar is worth only eighty-five cents." The following is a summary of the article:

    People are beginning to complain about the high cost of living, and the dollar buys very little.

    A pound of sirloin or a pound of steak now costs more than a dollar. A dollar buys only four or five loaves of bread. A twenty-dollar bill doesn't buy much at the grocery store. When the children started school last fall, the shoes they wore were more expensive than the year before, as were many clothes.

    Rents seem to be increasing year by year... The cost of sending young people to college is already shockingly high, and it's still going up year after year.

    The rising cost of medical care frightens many people.

    Consider what has happened to prices and service charges in typical cities across the United States in the past ten years: At the end of 1955, a haircut in a barber shop in San Francisco cost a man $1.50. Now it costs $2.50. At the end of 1955, a doctor in San Francisco charged $175 for an appendectomy. Now they charge patients $300. Ten years ago, a woman's blouse in a San Francisco store cost $60. Now it is priced at $108. Ten years ago, a Chicagoan spent $6 for a decent meal in a restaurant. Now it costs $7.50 to $8.

    In many ways, the dollar lacks the purchasing power it had only a short time ago. But officials insist that there is no real inflation in the United States, or at most only "creeping inflation"... But isn't this creeping inflation real inflation? What if the "creeping" accelerates, as it is doing now?

    The general trend of prices is constantly rising, and the process of the dollar's purchasing power declining has recently accelerated. Just in the past few weeks, some of our leading economists have warned that the U.S. economy has "overheated," and the threat of accelerating inflation is now greater than at any time since the early 1950s, during the Korean War.

### 约翰逊所不敢承认的事实

    约翰逊所不敢承认的事实
    约翰逊在经济报告中吹嘘美国的“价格稳定仍然是普遍规律”，并且竭力掩饰美国通货膨胀日益严重的情况。但是，一月二十四日出版的《美国新闻与世界报道》刊载的一篇文章，却揭穿了约翰逊的这种谎言与神话。它承认：“尽管官方保证美国享受着‘物价平稳’，一切物品的价格却继续不断地缓慢上涨。用十年前的购买力来算，一块美元只值八角五分。”下面是这篇文章的摘要：
    人们开始抱怨生活费用高昂，美元可以买到的东西很少。
    一磅肉排或一磅牛排现在都要值一块钱以上。一块钱只能买到四、五个面包。一张二十元的钞票在杂货店里买不上多少东西。当孩子们去年秋天开始上学时，他们所穿的鞋比前一年贵了，许多衣着也是如此。
    房租看来在逐年增加……送年轻人进大学的费用已经惊人地高昂，而一年年还在往上涨。
    医疗费用上涨的情况使许多人感到可怕。
    请看十年来美国全国各地典型城市的物价和服务行业收费所发生的情况：一九五五年底，在旧金山的一家理发店理发，一个男人收费一元五角美元。现在收费两元五角。一九五五年底，旧金山医生动一次盲肠手术收费一百七十五美元，现在向病人要三百美元。十年前在旧金山商店买一件女上衣要六十美元，现在标价一百零八美元。十年前，芝加哥市民到饭馆吃一餐象样的饭花六块美元，现在则需要七块半到八块美元。
    在许多方面，美元缺乏它在仅仅不久之前所具有的购买力。但是，官员们始终坚持说，在美国没有真正的通货膨胀，或者充其量只有“慢慢发展的通货膨胀”……但是，这种慢慢发展的通货膨胀会不会是真正的通货膨胀呢？如果，“慢慢发展”加速进行，就象现在这样，那怎么办呢？
    物价的总趋势是不断上升，而且美元的购买力下跌的过程最近还在加快。就在最近几个星期，我国一些首屈一指的经济学家警告说，美国经济已经“过热”，通货膨胀加速的威胁现在比二十世纪五十年代初叶朝鲜战争时期以来的任何时候都要大。
