    Spokesperson of the All-China Journalists Association Refutes the Indonesian Journalists Association's New Leadership's Unprovoked Attacks
    Indonesian Rightists Cannot Sabotage Asian-African Solidarity
    The All-China Journalists Association is obligated to provide all conveniences to enable the normal functioning of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association. The Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership's attacks are merely a component of the Indonesian right-wing's anti-China activities.
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th - A spokesperson for the All-China Journalists Association issued a statement on the 26th regarding the All-China Journalists Association's acceptance of the request from the resident secretaries of various countries in the Asian-African Journalists Association, warmly receiving them in Beijing after their temporary withdrawal from Jakarta.
    The spokesperson said: Since its establishment more than two years ago, the Asian-African Journalists Association has held high the banner of opposing imperialism and neo-colonialism and colonialism, strengthening the unity of Asian and African people and journalists, and has done a lot of work. Chinese journalists express their respect for this. Since last October, the Secretariat in Jakarta has encountered increasing obstruction and interference from Indonesian right-wing forces, making it impossible to continue its work and forcing it to temporarily withdraw from Jakarta. This is not the fault of the Secretariat and Indonesian progressive journalists, but the fault of Indonesian right-wing forces. After the resident secretaries of the Asian-African Journalists Association Secretariat were forced to withdraw from Jakarta due to the Indonesian right-wing forces' blatant interference, they requested to temporarily meet in Beijing to report to Secretary-General Djawoto and to convene a plenary meeting of the Secretariat as soon as possible to discuss and decide on the issue of a temporary headquarters and future work. The All-China Journalists Association is one of the secretaries of the Asian-African Journalists Association. We fully support the Secretariat's decision and its recent statements, and we are also obligated to provide all conveniences so that the Secretariat can function normally. We sincerely wish the Asian-African Journalists Association to quickly resume its daily work, which has been forced to be interrupted for more than three months in Indonesia, continue to promote its fighting tradition, and achieve new and greater achievements.
    The spokesperson continued: According to a report by the Indonesian Antara News Agency on January 21st, the Indonesian Journalists Association, which was reorganized last November, issued a statement groundlessly attacking the All-China Journalists Association for "unilaterally moving the Asian-African Journalists Association from Jakarta to Beijing," and also expressed some "protest." The spokesperson said: This so-called statement is an extremely malicious slander against the All-China Journalists Association. As everyone knows, the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association is an independent international organization, and no national journalists' organization has the right to interfere in its work or decide its actions. Its temporary withdrawal from Jakarta was due to the interference of Indonesian right-wing forces, including the Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership's interference and slander, making it impossible to continue its work. It is not others who should be condemned, but precisely the Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership. The Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership's attack on the All-China Journalists Association is a complete case of the thief crying "stop thief."
    The spokesperson said that in the past few months, the Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership first attacked the Asian-African Journalists Association Secretariat as being controlled by the "September 30th" movement; then, through a resolution, it demanded that the Secretariat re-examine the candidates for Secretary-General and Acting Secretary-General; and even designated a person to force the Secretariat to accept him as the Acting Secretary-General, completely exposing their ambition to control and monopolize the Asian-African Journalists Association. Facts show that it is not others who are interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, but the Indonesian right-wing and the Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership who are interfering in the Asian-African Journalists Association's internal affairs.
    The spokesperson emphasized: It is especially important to state that the leaders of the Indonesian Journalists Association who issued this statement usurped the leadership in a situation where a large number of progressive newspapers in Indonesia were closed down and a large number of progressive journalists were arrested and massacred last year. It is very clear what forces they represent. Their completely disregarding of facts and attacking the All-China Journalists Association can only show that this is a component of the Indonesian right-wing forces' anti-China activities. However, we want to sternly warn the Indonesian right-wing that their attempt to intensify anti-China activities to undermine the traditional great friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people and to undermine the unity of Asian and African people and journalists will absolutely not achieve their goal. This can only expose their hostility towards this friendship and unity, and therefore they cannot escape the condemnation of the Asian and African people.

    我记协发言人驳斥印度尼西亚记协新领导的无端攻击
    印度尼西亚右派破坏不了亚非团结
    中国记协有义务提供一切方便使亚非记协书记处正常进行工作。印度尼西亚记协新领导的攻击，不过是印度尼西亚右派反华活动的一个组成部分
    新华社二十六日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会发言人二十六日就中华全国新闻工作者协会接受亚非新闻工作者协会各国常驻书记的要求，热情接待他们暂时撤离雅加达后在北京会合一事，发表谈话。
    发言人说：亚非新闻工作者协会成立两年多以来，高举反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、加强亚非人民和新闻工作者团结的旗帜，作了很多工作，中国新闻工作者对此表示敬意。自从去年十月以来，书记处在雅加达遇到印度尼西亚右派势力日益加厉的阻难干涉，不能继续工作，被迫暂时撤离雅加达。这不是书记处和印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者的过错，而是印度尼西亚右派势力的过错。亚非新闻工作者协会书记处驻会书记由于印度尼西亚右派势力粗暴干涉而被迫撤离雅加达之后，要求到北京临时会合，以便向总书记查禾多先生报告，并尽快召开书记处全体会议，以讨论决定临时会址问题和今后工作。中华全国新闻工作者协会是亚非新闻工作者协会的书记之一，我们完全支持书记处的决定和它最近发表的各项声明，我们也有义务提供一切方便，使书记处能以正常进行工作。我们衷心祝愿亚非新闻工作者协会迅速恢复在印度尼西亚已被迫中断了三个多月的日常工作，继续发扬战斗传统，取得新的更大的成就。
    发言人接着说：根据印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社一月二十一日报道，去年十一月改组的印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会发表了一项声明，无端攻击中华全国新闻工作者协会“单方面把亚非新闻工作者协会撤离雅加达迁移北京”，还表示了什么“抗议”。发言人说：这个所谓的声明，是对中华全国新闻工作者协会极为恶劣的诽谤。大家都知道，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处是一个独立的国际组织，任何一个国家的记者组织，都无权干涉它的工作和决定它的行动。它不得不暂时撤离雅加达，是由于印度尼西亚右派势力的干涉，包括印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导对它的干涉和诽谤，而不能继续工作。应当受到谴责的不是别人，而恰恰是印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导。印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导对中华全国新闻工作者协会的攻击，完全是贼喊捉贼。
    发言人说，印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导，在过去几个月中，先是攻击亚非新闻工作者协会书记处被“九·卅”运动所控制；后则通过决定，要书记处重新审议总书记和代理总书记的人选；以至指定专人，强迫书记处接受他为代理总书记的职务，完全暴露了他们企图控制和垄断亚非新闻工作者协会的野心。事实表明，不是别人干涉印度尼西亚内政，而是印度尼西亚右派和印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导干涉亚非新闻工作者协会的内政。
    发言人着重指出：尤其要说明的是：发表这项声明的印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会的领导人，是在去年印度尼西亚大量进步报纸被封闭、大批进步新闻工作者被逮捕和屠杀的情况下篡夺了领导机构的，他们代表了什么力量是非常清楚的。他们完全不顾事实地攻击中华全国新闻工作者协会，只能说明这是印度尼西亚右派势力反华活动的一个组成部分。但是，我们要正告印度尼西亚的右派，他们企图加紧反华来破坏中国和印度尼西亚人民的传统伟大友谊，破坏亚非人民和新闻工作者的团结，是绝对达不到目的的，这只能暴露他们敌视这种友谊和团结的真面目，因而逃不脱亚非人民的谴责。
