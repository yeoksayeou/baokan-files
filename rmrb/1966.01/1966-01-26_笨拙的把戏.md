    Clumsy Tricks
    Shi Yuan
    To escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam, Johnson, in his budget message, proposed a war budget with expenditures as high as $112.8 billion. Even compared to the U.S.'s largest expenditure during World War II, the 1945 fiscal year budget of $98.4 billion, it pales in comparison.
    Budget expenditures reaching astronomical figures of twelve digits will inevitably greatly increase the burden on the American people; therefore, it will inevitably provoke more intense opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is what the American ruling class fears most. Johnson, therefore, had to talk about "the total deficit being $1.8 billion," "the smallest deficit in seven years," and that he would "guarantee that every dollar is used in accordance with the principle of thrift," etc. This is completely deceiving the American people.
    As everyone knows, the budgets put forward by successive U.S. governments usually shrink expenditures, portraying budgets that are about to show huge deficits as "balanced and thrifty" budgets. Kennedy's first budget after taking office in 1961 (the 1962 fiscal year budget) said the deficit was only $2 billion, but the result was a $6.4 billion deficit. His second budget (the 1963 fiscal year) claimed that there would be a surplus of $500 million, but the result was another $6.2 billion deficit. Johnson's government also called his proposed 1966 fiscal year budget "the smallest budget (deficit) since 1951." However, according to official U.S. estimates, this budget, which ends on June 30th of this year, has already exceeded the original figure by more than double due to Johnson's repeated additions of war expenditures, and will reach approximately $10 billion, becoming the second-largest deficit budget since 1951.
    Johnson says his new budget has only an $1.8 billion deficit on the premise that he will not add any more military spending. But, as he is increasingly expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, how is this possible? U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara has already made a request to add $12.3 billion in military spending, of which $4.6 billion will be from expenditures in this fiscal year, and the remaining $7.7 billion will be from expenditures in the new fiscal year. This alone has already caused the deficit in Johnson's new budget to far exceed $1.8 billion, reaching a deficit of more than $9.5 billion. Johnson is determined to continue "gradually escalating" the war of aggression against Vietnam. Who can predict how much more funding he will add in the next year?
    In fact, the trick that Johnson is playing has long been seen through. The well-known American bourgeois journalist Alsop pointed out in the January 8th issue of the *New York Herald Tribune* that this year, in order to ease the people's opposition to his huge budget, Johnson will "put forward" his demands "several times": "The total amount of the budget initially put forward can be deceptively, but pleasingly, reduced." "Then present a little, then present a little more, and finally make a supplementary appropriation."
    Johnson has to use this clumsy trick to deceive, which reflects how unfavorable his situation is.

    笨拙的把戏
    史元
    约翰逊为了变本加厉地扩大侵越战争，在他的预算咨文中提出了一个开支高达一千一百二十八亿美元的战争预算。拿美国在二次世界大战中花费最大的一九四五财政年度预算九百八十四亿美元同它相比，也相形见绌。
    预算开支达到十二位的天文数字，必然要大大加重美国人民的负担；因此，必然会招来对侵越战争的更激烈的反对。这是美国统治集团所最害怕的。约翰逊因此不得不大谈什么“赤字总数是十八亿美元”，“是七年中最小的赤字”以及什么“保证使用每一个美元都要本着节约原则”云云。这完全是欺骗美国人民的。
    大家知道，美国历届政府所提出来的预算，照例是缩小开支，把行将出现巨大赤字的预算，说成是“平衡和节约”的预算。肯尼迪一九六一年上台后提出的第一个预算（一九六二财政年度预算），说是赤字仅为二十亿美元，结果出现了六十四亿美元的赤字。他提出的第二个（一九六三财政年度）预算，自称将有盈余五亿美元，结果又出现六十二亿美元赤字。约翰逊政府去年也曾把他提出的一九六六财政年度预算称之为“一九五一年以来（赤字）最小的预算”。但是，根据美国官方的估计，这个到今年六月三十日截止的预算，由于约翰逊一再追加战费，赤字已比原数字超出了一倍还多，将达到一百亿美元左右，成为一九五一年以来第二个最大的赤字预算。
    约翰逊说他的新预算只有十八亿美元赤字，是以他不再追加军费为前提的。可是，在他日益扩大侵越战争的时候，这怎么可能呢？美国国防部长麦克纳马拉已经提出了追加军费一百二十三亿美元的要求，其中除四十六亿美元出于本财政年度的开支外，其余七十七亿多美元都将出于新财政年度的开支。仅仅这一笔，就已经使约翰逊的新预算的赤字远远超过十八亿美元，达到九十五亿多美元的赤字。约翰逊已决心继续在侵越战争中“逐步升级”，有谁能够预言他在下一年度里会再追加多少拨款？
    其实，约翰逊玩弄的这套障眼法，早已为人所识破。美国著名资产阶级记者艾尔索普在一月八日的《纽约先驱论坛报》上就指出，今年约翰逊为了缓和人民对他的庞大预算的反对，将“分几次提出”他的要求：“一开始提出的预算总额可以骗人地，但是令人高兴地减少”。“随后提出一点儿，又提出一点儿，最后再来一次补充拨款。”
    约翰逊不得不使用这种拙劣的手法来进行欺骗，这反映了他的处境是多么不妙。
