    Raise the Red Banner of Diligence and Frugality Higher and Higher
    -- On the New Developments in the Style of the Shi Gejie Mine

    Editor's Note: There is no development without struggle. This is a truth. For a backward unit to catch up with the advanced level, it must go through struggle, first and foremost, ideological struggle; for an advanced unit to continue to maintain its leading position, it must also go through struggle, first and foremost, ideological struggle.

    After the Shi Gejie Coal Mine became a national red banner unit for running enterprises with diligence and thrift, it faced a similar ideological struggle: "Protect the Red Banner," avoid risks, stop revolution, stop moving forward? Or "Raise the Red Banner," fear no risks, continue revolution, continue moving forward? This dispute between "raising the Red Banner" and "protecting the Red Banner" is essentially a struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, and also a class struggle within the enterprise. As a result, they won the battle in the class struggle to promote proletarian ideas and eliminate bourgeois ideas, they won the battle in the production struggle, and continued to maintain a leading position in the national coal mines.

    Not avoiding struggle, but daring to struggle; not lying on the Red Banner and stopping, but holding high the Red Banner and bravely moving forward. Only through struggle can we advance; only by raising the Red Banner can we protect the Red Banner. This is an experience that all red banner units in all walks of life should learn from.

    The Shi Gejie Mine of the Lu'an Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province, which was named a national red banner unit for running enterprises with diligence and thrift in 1963, has continuously armed the minds of its workers with Mao Zedong Thought over the past two years, opposed the complacency and conservatism of "protecting the Red Banner," and vigorously promoted the revolutionary idea of "raising the Red Banner," enabling the mine to take another big step forward on the road of running enterprises with diligence and thrift. After renovation, this old mine has not only increased its production capacity from 300,000 tons per year to 450,000 tons, but also extended the mine's lifespan by eleven years. All technical and economic indicators are at the advanced level among the national coal mines.

    The Struggle Between "Protecting the Red Banner" and "Raising the Red Banner"

    After the Shi Gejie Mine was named an advanced unit, brother units came here to visit and learn from it one after another. They were deeply moved by the deeds of diligence, thrift, and saving every bit. But they had a common view: the coal resource recovery rate here was low, and they hoped that they would reform the mining methods.

    The leading cadres of the Shi Gejie Mine humbly considered the opinions of comrades from brother units and decided to reform the mining methods. However, some people disagreed. They feared that a major reform of the mining methods would reduce efficiency and increase costs, and they worried about not being able to protect the Red Banner.

    Should they simply pursue indicators and protect the Red Banner without reforming the mining methods? Or should they comprehensively implement the spirit of the General Line, raise the Red Banner even higher, and reform the mining methods? This discussion was carried out in the mines, in the dormitories, and in the offices.

    Old worker Wang Zhenjiang recalled the scene of digging coal under the iron bars of the capitalists and said, "In the old society, capitalists, in order to make more money, mined and exploited mines in a chaotic manner, destroying countless resources. Now the mines are our own. It is not easy for the state to build a pair of mines. How can we not feel heartbroken seeing coal being discarded!"

    Li Jianxi, an old miner who participated in the revolutionary riot at the Shi Gejie Coal Mine, excitedly said, "Taking back the mines from the enemy was for the revolution. Now we are producing more coal for the revolution. As long as we can produce more coal for the country, no matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid."

    The more the matter was debated, the clearer it became: simply protecting the Red Banner meant being complacent and unwilling to make progress, and it meant not daring to make revolution. Wang Genbao, the Party Secretary who came from a worker background, helped everyone calculate several accounts: using the old methods of mining, the resource recovery rate was only 50%. Producing 300,000 tons of coal per year was equivalent to discarding 300,000 tons of coal at the same time. If the layered mining method was used, the resource recovery rate could be increased to about 75%, and the mine's lifespan could be extended by eleven years.

    The old miners' recollections and comparisons, and the big accounts calculated by the Party Secretary, made the workers realize the revolutionary significance of reforming the mining methods. Everyone worked together to strive for the new goal of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical mining.

    The new mining method had more procedures and was more complicated to operate than the original mining method. At the beginning, the production order was chaotic and could not be normalized for a while. What was the reason for the production chaos? Party Secretary Wang Genbao and the mine director, deputy mine director, and deputy chief engineer all came to the work face. They worked alongside the workers and consulted with the old workers, and found that the main contradiction in the production chaos was that the layering method was not appropriate. After seven days and seven nights of hard work, the new mining method was successfully implemented. Production was normalized, and the resource recovery rate reached 75% to 80%. They then found a way to reduce the consumption of pit props.

    This was a tough production battle fought by the Shi Gejie workers with solid thinking, realizing a revolution in mining methods. In 1964, they not only reserved a large amount of coal resources for the country, but also production flourished. The overall efficiency increased from 1.6 tons in 1963 to 1.7 tons, and the cost also decreased.

    Creating Miracles Through Poverty and Cleverness

    Reforming the mining methods created conditions for stable and high yields. However, in welcoming the new upsurge in production in 1965, the Shi Gejie Coal Mine encountered a new difficulty: the hoisting capacity of the wellbore was insufficient. Originally, this was a single-layer cage, which could only hoist one ton at a time. This was the key to whether the Shi Gejie Mine could achieve great development in production.

    Where was the way out? Obviously, it was necessary to改造to renovate the hoisting and transportation equipment. How to renovate? People's opinions were very different. Some advocated using skip hoisting. But to switch to this modern equipment, all the equipment above and below the well would have to be replaced. Some advocated replacing the one-ton mine cars that were currently in use with one-and-a-half-ton mine cars, but this would cost 300,000 yuan. Others advocated using the existing winch to convert the original single-layer cage into a double-layer cage. This was a way to solve the problem of insufficient hoisting capacity by tapping the potential of the equipment, which would neither cost much money nor require additional equipment. However, this was only an idea, and there was no precedent for it. The technicians were not sure.

    Several renovation plans were simultaneously brought up for discussion at the Party committee meeting. The Party committee clearly stated: Any reform should be based on the 600 million people and proceed from the conditions of the mine. This time, the reform of the hoisting equipment should adhere to the principle of self-reliance, hard struggle, diligence, and thrift, and create a new method that would neither cost money nor increase production capacity. After repeated discussions and comparisons, they decided to adopt the last plan.

    The task of renovating the hoisting equipment fell on Deputy Chief Engineer Xie Shuanggui and electromechanical engineer Gu Duyao. They were both students who graduated from secondary vocational and technical schools in 1955. Although they had been very familiar with coal production for ten years, this time they encountered many unexpected problems. The first problem they encountered was: reforming the existing winch must not exceed the load, and the hoisting capacity must be increased, but they did not know how much safety factor the winch had. What should they do if they had no experience? In order to measure the safety factor of the winch and the strength of the well frame, they organized people to go to coal science research departments and winch production units in Beijing, Shenyang, Fushun and other places to ask experts for advice; on the one hand, and to work with technicians from the Lu'an Mining Bureau and old workers from the mine on-site experiments. Two or three months passed, and people who went to other places for advice returned and said that they had never seen anything that could increase the hoisting capacity without replacing the winch.

    At this time, some people were discouraged and advised the two engineers to find another way. However, the two young engineers said: "We cannot lie in the arms of the country and rely on the country to replace our equipment. Machines are dead, but people are alive. People can make machines and can also改造remodel machines." They closely cooperated with the engineering and technical personnel of the higher authorities and other places, and made hundreds of repeated tests and repeated measurements with the old workers, and produced tens of thousands of words of data, and finally researched a method, which only spent 40,000 yuan to reinforce the well frame, and made some spare parts on the spot, increasing the hoisting capacity of the wellhead by 50%. Therefore, the production capacity of the Shi Gejie mine increased from 300,000 tons per year to 450,000 tons.

    The reform of the hoisting equipment made the Shi Gejie mine workers' minds more liberated, and they bravely moved forward to new technical levels. In the most recent year, the mine has renovated 36 technologies, and the production efficiency has doubled.

    Revolutionary Headquarters

    Production technology is constantly革新innovated, and workers' thinking is constantly improving. This new situation requires the mine's leadership to be further revolutionized.

    Originally, the Shi Gejie mine had many departments, and the division of labor was very detailed. Each department was in charge of its own line, which was not conducive to mutual cooperation or to grassroots production. Once, the coal mining work face urgently needed an electric drill, and someone was sent to the mine to receive it, but it took a long time to receive it. It turned out that to receive an electric drill, you had to register with the electromechanical section first, then calculate the cost at the finance section, then go to the supply section, and finally go to the warehouse to receive it.

    After the mine Party committee heard many similar responses, after investigation and research, starting from the principle of being beneficial to production and convenient for the miners, it changed the original nine sections into three stations and three offices. In addition to the two offices for life and administration, the mine-level leaders merged the original six sections of electromechanical, geology, labor, dispatch, statistics, and finance into the production office, so that various business operations had both cooperation and division of labor. In this way, the number of party, government, labor union, Communist Youth League, and采掘 mining team cadres in the mine was reduced from 93 to 61. At the same time, the working policy of the sections was clarified as being oriented to the grassroots, oriented to production, and oriented to the workers, and it was stipulated that the section cadres should take turns participating in labor on the front line of mining and working face, and serve production.

    The revolution in enterprise management is first and foremost a revolution in thinking. Initially, some people were still bound by 洋框框 foreign stereotypes, believing that the reform of the system would lose the mutual restraint of each section and disrupt the order. Some people also said: "How many cadres the country gives in the establishment should be how many there should be, and should not be reduced arbitrarily." The mine Party committee, however, believed that socialist enterprise management should first proceed from being beneficial to production and establish institutions according to the matter. What is scientific management? It is scientific if it meets the needs of production; it is unscientific if it does not meet the needs of production. After clarifying the principles of enterprise management, they further organized the section cadres to study articles such as "Serving the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." It was in this way that they established a new management institution on the basis of further establishing the idea of serving the revolution and the people.

    The enterprise management revolution completely overcame the "衙门化" bureaucratic style of the management institutions. Each business department achieved planning to the现场site, and materials were sent to the site. Mine leaders had more time and energy to participate in production guidance and production, and major production problems could be solved in a timely manner. Now, this mine no longer has production reporting meetings with multiple leads, and there are very few documents and reports, but production is well organized and can often achieve stable and high yields.

### 勤俭红旗越举越高——记石圪节矿风的新发展

    勤俭红旗越举越高
    ——记石圪节矿风的新发展
    编者按：没有斗争，就没有发展。这是一条真理。一个后进单位赶上先进水平，要经过斗争，首先是政治思想上的斗争；一个先进单位要继续居于领先地位，也要经过斗争，首先也是政治思想上的斗争。
    石圪节煤矿成为全国勤俭办企业的红旗单位以后，同样面临着这样一场政治思想斗争：是“保红旗”，不冒风险，不再革命，不再前进？还是“举红旗”，不怕风险，不断革命，不断前进？这个“举红旗”和“保红旗”之争，实质上就是无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想之争，也是企业中的一场阶级斗争。结果，他们在兴无灭资的阶级斗争中打了胜仗，在生产斗争中打了胜仗，继续在全国煤矿中居于领先地位。
    不是回避斗争，而是敢于斗争；不是躺在红旗上止步不前，而是高举红旗奋勇向前。只有斗争，才能前进，只有举红旗，才能保红旗。这是各行各业的红旗单位都应该吸取的经验。
    一九六三年被评为全国勤俭办企业红旗单位——山西省潞安矿务局石圪节矿，两年来不断用毛泽东思想武装职工的头脑，反对“保红旗”的自满、保守思想，大树“举红旗”的革命思想，使全矿在勤俭办企业的道路上又迈进了一大步。这个古老的矿井经过改造，不但生产能力由年产三十万吨提高到四十五万吨，而且也使矿井的开采寿命延长了十一年。各项技术经济指标都在全国煤矿中居先进水平。
    “保红旗”和“举红旗”之争
    石圪节矿被评为先进单位以后，兄弟单位来这里参观学习的人接连不断。他们看到这里克勤克俭、点滴节约的事迹深受感动，但是有个共同的看法：这里的煤炭资源回收率低，希望他们改革采煤方法。
    石圪节矿领导干部虚心考虑了兄弟单位同志的意见，决定要改革采煤方法。可是，有些人不同意，他们怕采煤方法大改革会使效率降低，成本提高，担心保不住红旗。
    是单纯求指标、保红旗，不改革采煤方法呢？还是全面贯彻总路线精神，更高地举红旗，改革采煤方法呢？这一场讨论在井下，在宿舍里，在办公室进行着。
    老工人王振江回想起在资本家铁棍下挖煤的情景说：“在旧社会，资本家为了多赚钱，在井下乱挖乱采，不知破坏了多少资源。现在矿山是我们自己的，国家建设一对矿井多不容易呀，眼看着煤炭丢掉，能不心痛！”
    曾参加过石圪节煤矿革命暴动的老矿工李建喜激动地说：“从敌人手里夺回矿山是为革命，现在我们多生产煤也是为了革命，只要能多给国家出煤，困难再大，我们也不怕。”
    事情越辩越明：单纯地保红旗就是故步自封，就是不敢革命。工人出身的党委书记王根保帮助大家算了几笔账：用过去的办法采煤，资源收回只有百分之五十，年产三十万吨煤，就等于同时丢掉三十万吨煤。如果改用分层开采办法，资源收回可提高到百分之七十五左右，矿井开采寿命可以延长十一年。
    老矿工的回忆对比，党委书记算的大账，使职工们认识到改革采煤方法的革命意义。大家齐心协力为实现多快好省的采煤新目标而奋斗。
    新的采煤法比原来的采煤法工序多，操作复杂，开始时生产秩序混乱，一时不能走向正常。生产混乱的原因在哪里？党委书记王根保和矿长、副矿长、副总工程师都到工作面来了。他们跟班劳动，同老工人商量，找到了生产秩序混乱的主要矛盾是分层方法不适当。经过七天七夜的奋战，新的采煤方法推行成功。生产正常了，资源回收率达到了百分之七十五到百分之八十。他们紧接着又找到了降低坑木消耗的办法。
    这是石圪节职工用过硬的思想打出的过硬的一场生产仗，实现了采煤方法革命。一九六四年不只给国家储备了大量的煤炭资源，而且生产蒸蒸日上。全员效率由一九六三年的一点六吨提高到一点七吨，成本还有下降。
    穷干巧干创奇迹
    改革采煤方法给稳产高产创造了条件，但是，在迎接一九六五年生产新高潮时，石圪节煤矿又遇到了新的难关：井筒提升能力不足。原来这里是单层罐笼，每次只能提升一吨。这是石圪节矿生产能否大发展的关键。
    出路在哪里？很明显，要改造提升设备和运输设备。如何改造？人们的主张很不一样。有的主张用箕斗提升。但是改用这种现代化的装备，井上井下的设备要全部更换。有的主张把正在使用的一吨矿车换成一吨半的，但是这要花费三十万元。还有的主张利用现有的绞车，把原来的单层罐笼改成双层，这是一种用挖掘设备潜力解决提升能力不足的办法，既不花多少钱，也不用增添设备。但是，这仅是一种设想，还没有先例，技术人员没有把握。
    几种改革方案同时提到党委会上讨论，党委明确地提出：任何一项改革，要从六亿人民着眼，从本矿条件出发。这次改革提升设备要本着自力更生勤俭办事的原则，创造出一种既不花钱，又能提高生产能力的新办法。经过反复讨论对比以后，他们决定采取最后一个方案。
    改革提升设备的任务落到了副总工程师谢栓贵、机电工程师古杜尧身上。他们都是一九五五年从中等专业技术学校毕业的学生。尽管十年来他们已经很熟悉煤炭生产了，但是这次却碰到了许多想不到的难题。首先碰到的难题就是：在现有的绞车上进行改革，既不能超过负荷，还要增加提升能力，可是绞车的安全系数究竟有多大，他们并不知道。自己没经验，怎么办？为了测算绞车的安全系数、井架的强度，他们一面组织人到北京、沈阳、抚顺等地的煤炭科学研究部门、绞车生产单位向专家请教；一面和潞安矿务局的技师、本矿的老工人在现场试验。两三个月过去了，到外地求教的人回来说，还没有见过不更换绞车，就能提高提升能力的事情。
    这时，有些人泄气了，劝两位工程师另找门路。可是，两位年青的工程师说：“我们不能躺在国家的怀里，靠国家给我们更换设备。机器是死的，人是活的，人能制造机器，也能改造机器。”他们同上级和外地的工程技术人员紧密配合，和老工人作了上百次的反复试验，反复测定，搞出了上万字的数据，终于研究出了一种办法，只花四万元加固了井架，就地制做了些备件，把井口提升能力增加了百分之五十。因此，石圪节矿井的生产能力由年产三十万吨提高到了四十五万吨。
    提升设备的改革，使石圪节矿职工思想更加解放了，他们向新的技术水平奋勇前进。最近一年间，全矿革新了三十六项技术，生产效率成倍提高。
    革命化的“司令部”
    生产技术不断革新，工人的思想不断提高，这种新的形势要求矿的领导必须进一步革命化。
    原来，石圪节矿的科室很多，分工很细，各管一行，既不便于互相协作，也不便于基层生产。有一次，采煤工作面急需一个电钻，派人到矿上领，老半天领不来。原来领一个电钻先得到机电科登记，再到财务科算成本，然后到供应科，最后才能去仓库领取。
    矿党委听到类似这样的许多反映以后，经过调查研究，从有利生产、便利矿工的原则出发，把原来的九个科室改成三站、三室。矿级领导除设生活、行政两个办公室外，把原来的机电、地质、劳动、调度、统计、财务六个科室合并成生产办公室，使各种业务工作既有合作，又有分工。这样一来，全矿党、政、工、团和采掘队干部由九十三人减至六十一人。同时，又明确了科室工作的方针是面向基层、面向生产、面向职工，并规定科室干部轮流到采掘第一线参加劳动，为生产服务。
    企业管理的革命，首先是一场思想革命。当初，有些人还受着“洋框框”的束缚，认为体制改革会失去各科室的互相制约作用，打乱了秩序。有的人还说：“国家在编制上给多少干部，就应该有多少，不应该随意减少。”矿党委却认为，社会主义企业管理首先要从有利于生产出发，因事设机构。什么是科学的管理？切合生产需要的就是科学的；不切合生产需要的就是不科学的。明确了企业管理的原则，又进一步组织科室干部学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。他们就是这样在进一步树立为革命为人民服务的思想基础上，确立了新的管理机构。
    企业管理革命彻底克服了管理机构的“衙门化”作风。各业务部门做到计划到现场，材料送到现场。矿领导干部有了更多的时间和精力参加生产指导生产，重大的生产问题也能得到及时解决。现在，这个矿已经没有多头绪的生产汇报会议了，各种文件表报很少，但生产井井有条，经常能稳产高产。
