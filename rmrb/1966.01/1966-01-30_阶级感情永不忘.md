    Never Forget Class Feelings
    I read the article "Class Feelings Weigh a Thousand Jin" three times in a row. Only in our new society, with the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, could such an earth-shattering and unprecedented event occur!
    The grief of parents suddenly losing their own flesh and blood—a thirteen-year-old son—is imaginable. However, deep class feelings suppressed the pain of "cutting out a piece of their heart." In order not to add to the other party's pain, they even tried every possible means to comfort them. What noble class feelings, what a broad mind!
    This matter has opened up a brand-new realm of emotion for us, that is, in handling various problems, we must prioritize proletarian feelings. If parents who have lost their son can handle it in this way, what problems, opinions, differences, and so-called "interests" between comrades in daily life cannot be correctly handled from the perspective of class interests and with a "comradely" attitude?
    Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, in our new society, we are not only friends but also comrades. "Comrade" is such a kind and firm word. We must strictly demand ourselves according to the standards of a comrade in every place, at every time, and in everything, to achieve the unity of our entire nation and the unity of the people of the world.

    阶级感情永不忘
    《阶级感情千斤重》一文我一连读了三遍，只有在我们新社会，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，才会出现如此惊天动地、史所未有的事迹！
    父母突然失去自己的亲骨肉——十三岁儿子时候的悲痛是可想而知的。然而，深厚的阶级感情，抑制住了“剜却心头肉”的悲痛。为了不给对方增加痛苦，还千方百计地安慰对方。这是多么高尚的阶级感情，多么博大的胸怀。
    此事给我们开辟了一个崭新的感情境界，就是在处理各种各样问题的时候，要以无产阶级感情为重。父母失去了儿子都能如此处理，在日常生活中，与同志们之间，还有什么问题、意见、分歧以及所谓“利害”，不能从阶级的利益出发，以“同志”的态度来正确处理呢？
    在党和毛主席的领导下，在我们新社会，我们不仅是朋友，而且是同志。“同志”是多么亲切而又坚毅的字眼，我们要处处、时时、事事以同志的标准严格要求自己，以达到我们全民族的团结，达到全世界人民的团结。
