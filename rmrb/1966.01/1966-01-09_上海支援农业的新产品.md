    Shanghai's New Products to Support Agriculture
    Water Paddy Field Tractor
    The "Harvest" 35-horsepower paddy field tractor, designed according to the tillage needs of rice-growing areas in China, has recently been initially finalized in Shanghai. The Shanghai 71 Tractor Factory and other units have made arrangements to produce this type of tractor in small batches this year.
    Cultivation tests in rice-growing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and other provinces have proved that this tractor has good adaptability. The "Harvest" 35 paddy field tractor can cultivate deep, muddy fields that ordinary tractors cannot enter.
  New Type Powder and Mist Sprayer
    The Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory has produced three new types of powder and mist sprayers for agricultural and forestry production. One is a high-range sprayer used in conjunction with the "Gongnong-7" hand-held tractor, which can spray up to 17 meters high and 23 meters far. This sprayer is suitable for preventing and controlling diseases and pests of tall trees and large areas of rice and vegetable fields; one unit can replace more than ten hand-operated sprayers. The second is a new type of stretcher-mounted motorized sprayer, for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in rice, orchards, and cotton fields. Compared with the old products, this new product is more efficient, lighter in weight, and uses about half the materials. The third is a hand-held smoke sprayer, a powerful weapon for eliminating forest and crop diseases and pests over large areas by means of smoke spraying. It weighs only ten kilograms, is easy to operate, is more than ten times more efficient than general spraying methods, and the prevention and control costs are also lower.
  New Type Diesel Engine for Agricultural Use
    In response to the problems existing in the "195-1" diesel engine originally produced, the employees of the Chengfu Power Machine Factory have recently independently designed a "195-2" diesel engine that is suitable for the needs of China's rural areas and is economically reasonable. Compared with the old product, this diesel engine has a higher power output of two to six horsepower, a weight reduction of forty kilograms, and a simplified structure.

    The Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, which used indigenous equipment to produce China's first special-shaped seamless steel tube, has recently trial-produced a batch of spiral blade seamless steel tubes urgently needed by the petroleum and machinery industries in order to meet the country's need for a variety of special-shaped seamless steel tubes.

    上海支援农业的新产品
    水田拖拉机
    根据我国水稻地区耕作需要而设计的“丰收”三十五马力水田型拖拉机，新近在上海初步定型。上海七一拖拉机制造厂等单位已作好安排，准备在今年小批生产这种拖拉机。
    这种拖拉机经江苏、浙江、广东等省水稻地区耕作试验证明，适应性很好。一般拖拉机不能下去的深淤田，“丰收”三五水田型拖拉机能够下去耕作。
  新型喷粉喷雾机
    上海农业药械厂为农业和林业生产制成了三种新型喷粉喷雾机。一种是同“工农七型”手扶拖拉机配套使用的高射程喷雾机，能喷高十七米，喷远二十三米。这种喷雾机适宜用来防治高大树木和大面积稻田、菜田的病虫害，一台能顶十多台手压喷雾器使用。第二种是新型担架式机动喷雾机，是供水稻、果园、棉花田防治病虫害用的。这种新产品同老产品相比，效率高，重量轻，用料省一半左右。第三种是手提喷烟机，是一种用喷烟的方法大面积地消灭森林和农作物病虫害的有力武器。它的重量只有十公斤，操作方便，比一般喷雾方法效率高十多倍，防治费用也低。
  农用新型柴油机
    诚孚动力机厂职工针对原来生产的“一九五——一型”柴油机存在的问题，新近自行设计了一种适合我国农村需要而又经济合理的“一九五——二型”柴油机。这种柴油机同老产品相比，功率高出两马力到六马力，重量减少了四十公斤，结构也简化了。
