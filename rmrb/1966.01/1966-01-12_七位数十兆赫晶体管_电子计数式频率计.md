    Seven-Digit Ten-Megahertz Transistor
    Electronic Counting Frequency Meter
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing -- A seven-digit, ten-megahertz transistor electronic counting frequency meter has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Nanjing Telecommunications Instrument Factory.
    Electronic counting frequency meters are important measuring instruments for radio electronics industry departments and scientific research institutions. It is mainly used to measure frequency and time, and the smallest unit for measuring time is one hundred millionth of a second.
    The measurement error of this transistor electronic counting frequency meter does not exceed two parts per ten million. Equipped with conversion devices, this frequency meter can also be widely used in many industrial sectors. Compared with vacuum tube frequency meters, it has the advantages of lower power consumption, smaller size, lighter weight, and longer lifespan.
    Transistor counting frequency meters are a new type of instrument internationally in the 1960s. The staff of Nanjing Telecommunications Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced this new product with the help of Nanjing Institute of Technology, Shanghai Xin Jian Electronic Instrument Factory and other units. In the trial-production process, the staff creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, overcoming one technical difficulty after another, and as a result, achieved success in just one year. After appraisal by relevant departments, it was considered to have stable performance and met the design requirements. (Attached picture)

    七位数十兆赫晶体管
    电子计数式频率计
    新华社南京电　一种七位数十兆赫的晶体管电子计数式频率计，最近在南京电讯仪器厂试制成功。
    电子计数式频率计是无线电电子工业部门和科学研究机关重要的测量仪器。它主要用于测量频率和时间，测量时间的最小单位是万万分之一秒。
    这种晶体管电子计数式频率计，测量误差不超过千万分之二。这种频率计配上变换装置还可以广泛地应用在许多工业部门。它同电子管频率计比较，具有用电省、体积小、重量轻、寿命长的优点。
    晶体管计数式频率计是国际上六十年代的新型仪表。南京电讯仪器厂职工是在南京工学院、上海新建电子仪器厂等单位的帮助下试制成功这种新产品的。在试制过程中，职工们活学活用毛主席著作，攻克了一个又一个的技术难关，结果在短短一年的时间里就获得成功。经过有关部门鉴定，认为它的性能稳定，达到了设计要求。（附图片）
