    Wang Jie Class
    Determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, maintain and promote Wang Jie's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, and become more revolutionary and combat-ready.
    Wang Jie Class Leader Hou Xingjia
    "Engaging in revolution means enduring hardship." "A person in this world should dedicate everything to the great cause of humanity – Communism." These are two sentences our former class leader Wang Jie often said. He not only said this, but also used these words to guide his actions in everything he did.
    Last January, the leadership assigned the class a task: to be a pioneer class in military training, to create an outstanding detachment like Guo Xingfu. At that time, it was the coldest time of winter, with howling winds and swirling snow. Wang Jie led us to set up camp in the wilderness, eating and training in the fields. When burying mines, the ground was frozen solid; one swing of the pickaxe left only a white mark. The weather was so cold that our faces felt like they were being pricked by needles as soon as we went outside. When we encountered difficulties, he organized us to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," educating us to endure hardship and train seriously. Under his leadership, everyone lay on the ground from morning till night, burying and digging, digging and burying. Our hands cracked and bled, our faces and ears were red and swollen with frostbite, and our bodies ached all over when we went to bed at night. However, when we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and saw the exemplary actions of Class Leader Wang Jie, we persevered and kept training.
    After Class Leader Wang Jie sacrificed himself, we studied and carried forward this revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or death. Whenever we encountered difficulties, we thought of Wang Jie and secretly resolved: whatever the class leader could do, we must also do. With this determination, we generated tremendous strength and successfully completed various tasks.
    Recently, we conducted "fuse lighting method" training. Although this lesson was relatively simple, everyone firmly remembered what Class Leader Wang Jie had said before his death: "Training must conform to actual combat, be strict and demanding, and practice more skills." We practiced repeatedly and diligently, exceeding the targets set by the higher authorities. During "military road construction" training, we created a device that could measure both slope and turning angle. One night, the leadership asked us to measure a section of road in half an hour, and we completed it in only twenty minutes.
    The first thing that soldiers learn and develop from Class Leader Wang Jie's spirit of "wholeheartedly serving the revolution" is to "take Class Leader Wang Jie as an example, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and guide all actions with Mao Zedong Thought." We have adhered to the system Wang Jie established before his death of studying Chairman Mao's works once a day in connection with our thoughts and work. During more than half a month of participating in a construction project, the task was heavy and the labor intensity was high, requiring us to work ten hours a day. But everyone still persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works. New soldier Hu Dejin had a low level of education, and he did not recognize many characters in his studies, so he wrote down each character one by one and asked others about them. He studied the article "Serve the People" more than twenty times. Everyone carried Chairman Mao's quotations and Wang Jie's diary with them, reading and looking at them every day; some comrades copied the sentence "However Chairman Mao says things should be done, that is how I will do them” from Wang Jie's diary into their notebooks, treating it as their motto.
    As the new year approaches, our class held a special meeting. The soldiers said that 1966 is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, adhere to the "Four Firsts," maintain and promote Class Leader Wang Jie's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the revolution, polish our rifles even brighter, hone our skills in killing the enemy even sharper, and move our class towards a more revolutionary and combat-ready goal!

    王杰班
    决心更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，保持和发扬王杰一心为革命的精神，更加革命化和战斗化。王杰班班长　侯兴家
    “干革命是要吃苦的。”“人生在世界上，应该把自己的一切献给人类的伟大事业——共产主义。”这是我们前任班长王杰常说的两句话。他不仅这样说，也处处用这话来指导自己的行动。
    去年一月，领导上交给班里一项任务：做军事训练的先行班，象郭兴福那样带出个出色的小分队。当时是数九寒天，风吼雪飘，王杰领着我们到野外安营扎寨，吃在田间，练在田间。埋雷训练的时候，地冻，一镐下去一个白印；天寒，一出门脸上就象针刺的一样。遇到了困难，他就组织我们学习《愚公移山》，教育我们要吃得苦、练得真。大家在他的带领下，从早到晚趴在地上，埋了挖，挖了埋，手上裂开了血口子，脸和耳朵冻得又红又肿，晚上睡觉浑身疼痛。可是，当大家想到毛主席的教导，看到王杰班长的模范行动，始终坚持不懈，练个不停。
    王杰班长牺牲以后，我们学习和发扬了这种不怕苦、不怕死的革命精神。每当遇到困难的时候，我们想起王杰，便暗暗下定决心：班长能做到的，我们也一定要做到。有了这样的决心，就会产生巨大的力量，顺利地完成各项任务。
    最近，我们进行“导火索点火法”训练，虽然这一课比较简单，但是大家牢牢记住王杰班长生前说的：“训练必须符合实战，从难从严，多练几手。”我们一次又一次地反复苦练，练得超过了上级规定的指标。在“修建军用道路”训练时，我们自制出一种器材，既可测量坡度，又可测量转角。一天晚上，领导上叫我们在半小时内测完一段道路，我们只用了二十分钟就完成了。
    战士们学习和发扬王杰班长“一心为革命”的精神，第一条就是“以王杰班长为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想指导一切行动。”王杰生前规定的每天联系思想和工作，学习一次毛主席著作的制度，我们坚持下来了。在参加一项修建工程的半个多月劳动中，任务重，劳动强度大，每天要工作十来个小时。但大家照样坚持了学习毛主席著作。新战士胡德金文化水平低，学习中有不少字不认识，他就一个字一个字地记下来，去问别人。《为人民服务》这篇文章，他学习了二十多遍。大家把毛主席语录、王杰日记带在身边，天天读，时时看；有的同志把王杰日记中“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”抄在日记本里，当作自己的座右铭。
    在新的一年到来的时候，我们班专门开了一次会，战士们说，一九六六年是我国实行第三个五年计划的头一年。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，突出政治，坚持四个第一，保持和发扬王杰班长一心为革命、一切为革命的精神，把钢枪擦得更亮，把杀敌本领练得更硬，使我们的班朝着更加革命化、战斗化的目标前进！
