    The Dialectical View of Contradictions in Buying and Selling
    Fan Yuzhen, Salesperson at the Lanzhou Women and Children's Goods Store
    Buying and Not Buying
    Salespeople deal with a large number of customers every day, generally falling into two categories: those who buy and those who don't. Some come to the store with a clear purpose and buy what they need; others have no specific goal but decide to buy when they see something they like; and still others are just browsing. In the past, I viewed these types of customers as absolute and static, believing that if a customer intended to buy, we could complete the transaction as long as we had the item, and that there was no point in talking to customers who didn't want to buy. Therefore, when serving customers, I was enthusiastic when they said they wanted to buy, but I felt discouraged when they said they were just looking, and my attitude changed. Once, a customer said to me, "It's infuriating! I wanted to look at leather shoes, planning to buy them after I get paid, but your salesperson said, 'I'll get them for you if you're buying.' Why treat customers who buy and don't buy differently? Can't I just look if I'm not buying?" These words, although not a direct criticism of me, enlightened me. I realized that I should view everything from a developmental perspective and look at problems dialectically. Today's browsing for this customer is for tomorrow's buying. For everyone, food, clothing, fuel, and supplies are all provided through the work of salespeople, so in general, there is no distinction between buying and not buying, meaning there are no customers who don't buy. As it appears on our counter, if they don't buy this time, they may buy next time; today's buyers may have been lookers last time; if they don't buy now, they may come back later. From the store's perspective: not buying at this counter doesn't mean they won't buy at another counter; not buying at our store doesn't mean they won't buy at another store... After understanding these points, I examined why I treated customers who bought and didn't buy differently. The main reason was that a simple task-oriented view was at play in my mind, and I had not firmly established the ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people. From then on, I changed that approach and treated all customers, whether buying or not, equally and with enthusiasm. For example, once a customer wanted to buy a suitcase, but we only had three in the sales area, and he couldn't find one he liked. We brought out five more from the warehouse. The customer looked for a while and then said, "I'll go look at other stores." I immediately said to the customer, "Buying a suitcase is something you'll use for ten or eight years, so it's good to choose carefully. It's fine to look at other stores, and if you don't find one you like, please come back and take another look." The customer returned in less than two hours, asked us to help him choose one, and thanked us for not being bothered.
    From my actual work, I felt that buying and not buying can also transform into each other, and the main aspect of the contradiction is how we do our work. If our salespeople have a poor service attitude, inadequate professional skills, or excessively high retail starting points, etc., it will cause customers who originally wanted to buy to not buy. For example, in the past, our group sold white gauze ribbons, and we required them to be sold in whole rolls. Customers couldn't buy them in smaller quantities, so they just looked and left. Later, we broke up the rolls and sold them in smaller quantities, selling as much as the customer wanted, thus resolving this contradiction. If our service attitude is poor, even if a customer buys this time, they won't come back to you next time. Conversely, there are many customers who originally didn't want to buy, but after our enthusiastic service, introduction of new products, and serving as good "advisors" when customers are hesitant, as long as they really need it, they will buy it. For example, recently two actresses participating in the Northwest Five Provinces Art Performance came to the store to browse. They saw a kind of artificial leather handbag, and one said: "The style is very good, but unfortunately they are all coffee-colored." The other asked me: "Do you have gray ones?" At that time, I thought: just answering "no" would make the customer leave disappointed. Then I introduced that there was also a black one, which was also very generous. As soon as the customers heard there was black, they asked me to bring it to them. At this time, the black ones on the counter were sold out, so I picked out two from the warehouse. They were very satisfied when they saw them, and they both bought them. Before leaving, they asked to reserve one, saying that another comrade wanted to buy it. In addition, when selling goods, we pay attention to introducing related products, such as introducing pillowcases when customers buy bedsheets, introducing toothpaste when buying toothbrushes, introducing mirrors when buying combs, and introducing laundry detergent when buying soap, which will also prompt customers who didn't think about it at the time to change from not planning to buy to buying. As long as we truly treat customers who buy and don't buy the same way, even customers who don't buy temporarily will feel close. As the saying goes, "Even if a sale doesn't go through, goodwill remains," leaving a very good impression and creating conditions for the next purchase.
              Good to Serve and "Difficult" to Serve
    In the past, in my sales work, I often divided customers into two types: those who were good to serve and those who were difficult to serve. Customers who had a good attitude towards me, didn't pick or choose, and bought and left were considered good customers; customers who had a bad attitude towards me, picked and chose, and exchanged things were considered difficult customers. Therefore, I also adopted two different attitudes and approaches in serving them: I was enthusiastic towards customers with a good attitude, and I was indifferent towards customers with a relatively blunt attitude. I was happy to take out more items and say a few more words to good customers; I showed impatience to difficult customers. For example, in the past, when I encountered such a customer at the cosmetics counter, he wanted to buy a bottle of snow cream, and he opened all six bottles on the counter one by one to see if they were full and to smell if they were fragrant. Finally, he picked one bottle, and I felt it was too troublesome and really difficult to serve. Conversely, some customers wanted Friendship Snow Cream, and I took out a bottle for him, and he paid and left. I liked these people in my heart. Once, the store received a batch of new plastic handbags. I thought they were all very good, but the comrades in our group said some were good and some were bad. I casually said, "Really troublesome." Some comrades retorted, "Everyone has their own preferences." Her retort enlightened me. I thought: our group has only a dozen comrades, and there are already different preferences, and we have to serve so many customers every day, and they come from all over the world, so aren't there more different preferences? The main reason why I didn't handle it well in the past was that I thought too little about the customers' needs and too much about my own convenience. In reality, it was a kind of reluctance to "serve people" and fear of trouble. From then on, I gradually resolved this contradiction in my work. For example, once, a male and a female customer were selecting a plastic handbag. The woman initially said: the color matching was not good. Later, she liked one, but found that there was a joint on the strap. I still enthusiastically helped them choose. In total, they picked out more than ten before buying one. Another time, a customer wanted to buy a bed sheet. He didn't want the ones taken from the shelf, and insisted on having the sample on display. The comrades in our group explained to him, but he didn't listen, so we took down the sample, and he bought it and left satisfied. These facts fully demonstrate that customers have different personalities and different tempers, and these are all objectively existing. As long as we truly establish the ideology of making things convenient for others and keeping the difficulties for ourselves, we will not care about the customer's attitude, and we will not treat customers who choose a lot as difficult customers.
    In fact, so-called good and difficult can also be transformed, and the key lies in the subjective efforts of the salesperson. As long as we serve customers actively, enthusiastically, sincerely, and patiently, so-called difficult customers will become good customers; if we are too lazy and impatient, customers who were originally good to serve will also become difficult customers. Even if we encounter customers who choose multiple times but don't buy, as long as our attitude is enthusiastic and sincere, customers will trust us, and if they don't buy this time, they will come back next time. For example, once a customer wanted to buy a nylon mesh bag. He didn't pick or choose and bought one, and I didn't check it. He paid and left, but returned not long after, saying that a nylon thread on the mesh bag was broken. At that time, fortunately, some comrades in the group knew that one was defective, so they exchanged it for him. If we had handled it carelessly, he would not trust us in the future, and he would have to repeatedly pick and choose when buying things, becoming a so-called "difficult" customer.
    There are also a very small number of people who are impolite to salespeople and treat them with rude words and actions. Some belong to bad people, and we must engage in reasoning and struggle; some have a low level of consciousness, and we must patiently persuade them.

    买卖中的矛盾观
    兰州市妇女儿童用品商店营业员　樊玉珍
    买和不买
    营业员每天要接待大量的顾客，一般说来，不外乎买和不买两种类型。有的是有准备有目的地来到商店，买上需要的商品就走；有的虽然没有目的，但看到好的商品，临时决定而买的；有的是来参观的。对这几种顾客，过去我把他看成是绝对的、静止的，认为准备买的顾客，只要我们有商品就可以达成交易，不想买的顾客多说也没有用。因此在接待顾客时，顾客表示要买我就热情，听顾客说是看一看的，心里就凉了一半，态度也不一样了。有一次，一个顾客对我说，真气人，我想看看皮鞋，准备发了工资以后再来买，但你们营业员却说：“你买我给你拿”，为啥对买与不买的顾客两样对待，我不买就不能看看吗？这几句话虽然不是直接批评我，却使我受到启发，我想对待任何事物都要用发展的观点，辩证地看问题。这个顾客今天的看，就是为了明天的买。就每个人来说，吃穿烧用都要通过营业员的工作供应到他们手里，因此在整体上讲没有买和不买的区别，也就是说没有不买的顾客。表现在我们柜台上，这次不买可能下次来买，今天买的可能上次是看的；现在不买，也有回头来买的。从商店来讲：在这个柜台不买，不等于在别的柜台也不买，在我们商店不买，也可能在别的商店买上……。这些问题想通了，我又检查为什么对买和不买的顾客会态度不同呢？主要还是单纯的任务观点在脑子里作怪，没有牢固地树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想。从此我改变了那种作法，对买与不买的顾客一视同仁，热情接待。如有一次一个顾客要买一个皮箱，当时营业室只有三个，挑不中意，我们又从库房里拿出五个，这个顾客挑了一阵又说：我到别家看看。当时我就对顾客说：“买一个皮箱，要用十年八年，挑的仔细些。到别家看看也好，如果没有合适的，请再过来看看。”顾客走了不到两个小时又回来了，叫我们帮助他挑选了一个，并对我们不嫌麻烦表示感谢。
    从实际工作中，使我感觉到买和不买也是会相互转化的，矛盾的主要方面是看我们的工作怎样。如果我们营业员的服务态度不好，业务技术水平不过硬，零售起点过高，等等，就会使本来想买的顾客也不买了。如过去我们小组出售的白纱带，规定要整盘卖，顾客买不到零的，只好看一看就走了。以后我们拆整卖零，顾客要多少卖多少，解决了这一矛盾。如果我们服务态度不好，顾客就是这次买了，下次要买也不到你这里来了。相反有不少原来不想买的顾客，经过我们热情接待，介绍新的产品，在顾客犹豫不决的时候当好“参谋”，注意做转化工作，只要他确实需要，也会买上的。如最近有两位参加西北五省文艺会演的女演员，来商店参观。他们看到一种人造革提包，一个说：式样倒很好，可惜都是咖啡颜色的。另一个就问我：有没有灰色的。当时我想：只要回答一声没有，就会使顾客失望地走去。这时我就介绍还有一种黑色的，也很大方，顾客一听有黑色的，就叫我拿来看看，这时柜台上黑的已卖完，就从库房里挑了两个，她们一看很满意，两个都买走了，临走时还叫留上一个，说还有一个同志要买哩。另外，我们在售货时，注意连带商品的介绍，如顾客买了床单介绍枕巾，买了牙刷介绍牙膏，买了梳子介绍镜子，买了香皂介绍洗衣粉，也会促使一时想不周到的顾客，从没有准备买变为买。只要我们确实做到对买和不买的顾客同样接待，就是暂时不买的顾客，也会感到亲切，俗话说：“买卖不成仁义在”，留下一个很好的影响，为下次来买创造条件。
              好接待和“难”接待
    以往我在售货工作中，往往把顾客分为好接待和难接待的两种。对我态度好，不挑不拣，买了就走，认为是好接待的顾客；对我态度不好，挑挑拣拣，换来换去，认为是难接待的顾客。因此在接待上也采取了两种不同的态度和做法：顾客态度好，我就热情，顾客态度比较生硬，我就冷淡。对好接待的顾客，多拿几种商品，多说几句话也高兴；对难接待的，就表现出不耐烦。比如，过去在化妆品柜台上碰到这样的顾客，他要买一瓶雪花膏，把柜台上摆的六瓶都一个一个打开看看满不满，嗅嗅香不香，最后才挑了一瓶，我感到太麻烦，实在难接待。相反，有的顾客要友谊雪花膏，取给他一瓶，付款就走，这样的人我心里就喜欢。有一次商店来了一批新产品塑料提包，我自己看看都很好，我们小组的同志却有的说这个好，有的说那个好。我随口说了句“真麻搭”，有的同志就顶了我一句：“百人百性么”。她这一顶，使我受到启发，我想：我们小组只有十多个同志，就有个“百人百性”，我们每天要接待这么多的顾客，他们又来自五湖四海，不是就有更多的“百人百性”么？我过去处理不好，主要原因是对顾客的要求想的少，对自己的方便想的多，实际上是一种不愿“伺候人”和怕麻烦的思想作怪。从此我在工作中才逐渐解决了这个矛盾。如有一次，男女两个顾客挑选一种塑料提包，女的开始说：颜色配衬不好，后来看上了一个，又发现带子上有个接头，我仍热情帮助挑选，先后共挑了十来个，才买了一个。又有一次，一个顾客买一条床单，从货架上取出同样的他不要，坚持要挂的样品，我们小组同志对他解释他不听，我们就把样品拿下来，他满意地买上走了。这些事实，充分说明了顾客的性格不同，脾气不一样，这都是客观存在的，只要我们真正树立了方便送别人，困难留自己的思想，就不会计较顾客的态度，对挑选多的顾客也不会当成难接待的顾客了。
    事实上所谓好和难也可以转化，关键在于营业员的主观努力。只要我们主动热情、诚恳、耐心地接待顾客，所谓难接待的会变成好接待的；如果我们嫌麻烦，不耐心，本来好接待的也会变成难接待的顾客。就是碰上挑选多次而不买的顾客，只要我们态度是热情、诚恳的，顾客就会信任我们，这次不买下次也会来买的。如有一次一位顾客要买尼龙丝网兜，不挑不拣买走了一个，我也没有检查，他付了钱就走，但过了不久又回来了，说网兜的一根尼龙丝断了。当时幸亏小组有的同志知道有一个是残的，就调换了一个。如果我们马马虎虎处理了，以后他就不会信任我们，买东西就得反复挑选，变成所谓“难”接待的了。
    还有极少数人，对营业员不礼貌，以粗鲁的言行相待。有的是属于坏人，要进行说理斗争；有的是觉悟不高，要耐心说服。
