    Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To accomplish its task of leadership, the Party committee must rely on the 'group of people' of the Party committee and give full play to their role." "If this 'group of people' does not act in unison, it is futile to lead millions of people to fight and build."
    According to the standards set by Comrade Mao Zedong, is the action of the Party Committee of a certain division of the Kunming Troops uniform? It is both uniform and not uniform. For many years, they have insisted on studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and their actions have been uniform, so their work has been successful. However, at one period, some comrades, for various reasons, believed that their study was for the purpose of educating the troops, not for transforming themselves. Lacking the awareness of study, their work became more blind. In this way, it was impossible for everyone's actions to be completely uniform.
    For actions to be uniform, there must be a common ideological foundation, which is Mao Zedong Thought. If everyone vigorously studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought and acts in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, there will be reason, direction, a common language, and working principles. When everyone has this revolutionary awareness, their actions will of course be uniform.
    "How the dragon's head swings determines how the dragon's tail wags." The uniform action of the Party committee is the prerequisite for the uniform action of the entire army. The Party Committee of a certain division of the Kunming Troops has grasped the fundamental link of consciously studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, which has driven all the work of the entire division. This is a good experience.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th – The Party Committee of a certain division of the Kunming Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in the course of vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, has vigorously grasped the ideological revolutionization of Party committee members and leading cadres, achieving successes and gaining experience. Now, the members of this division's Party committee have not only developed good self-study habits, but have also universally grasped ideological transformation and attached importance to adhering to Mao Zedong Thought in their respective areas of responsibility. Under their leadership, various organs and troops have launched a larger-scale upsurge of vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, accelerating revolutionization and modernization.
    This division's Party committee has persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works for a relatively long time, but at one period, some comrades believed that they had participated in the revolution for many years, were active and responsible in their work, and had not caused any problems, so there was nothing to transform. They regarded studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming their thinking as the affair of soldiers and grassroots cadres, while their own study was mainly for educating the troops and solving work problems. Because of this view, some cadres lacked a high degree of awareness of study, and their study was not sufficiently targeted. Many problems in their work could not be traced to their roots, and therefore could not be fundamentally solved. For example, they had a long-standing problem of working in a generalized way. Why this generalized approach? In the past, when they studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind, they only looked for reasons in work style and methods. They believed that the reason for working in a generalized way was mainly because they were not good at grasping typical examples and both ends, not going deep into reality, and not implementing the instructions of higher authorities from reality, etc., without grasping the problem of leadership thinking. Therefore, even if they understood the need to go deep into the grassroots and practice personally, some comrades still did not go to the company; some went down, but did not put down their airs and mingle with the soldiers, so they could not discover real problems; some problems were discovered, but they lacked the lofty ambition to transform the world and did not seriously solve them; some comrades also worked hard with the troops, but because their thinking still had subjective and one-sided, self-righteous problems, they always demanded that objective reality conform to their subjective wishes, and the quality of training still could not be improved. Many facts have made them realize that correct action comes from correct thinking. If they have subjectivism, selfish ideas, and fear of hardship in their minds, they cannot correctly reflect the objective world or transform the objective world. If they do not use Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves, they cannot truly act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and do their work well.
    How to grasp the ideological revolutionization of Party committee members? Starting the year before last, the division's Party committee, through studying Chairman Mao's four philosophical works, studying rectification documents, studying the experiences of advanced units and advanced figures, and combining it with rectifying the work of the organs and summing up experiences, repeatedly increased everyone's awareness of ideological revolution, so that each member of the Party committee gradually realized that: leading cadres must never lie on the "old" character and sleep soundly; they must always "divide themselves into two," admitting that they need to be transformed; Chairman Mao's works are the fundamental weapon for transforming their thinking, and if their thinking does not touch the edge of the works when studying, they will never learn them; educators should first be educated, improving work requires first transforming their thinking, and educating the troops requires first educating and transforming themselves; to put effort into the application of study, first put effort into transforming their thinking. After recognizing these problems, a new atmosphere gradually formed among the leading cadres of this division: daring to expose problems, admitting their mistakes, being brave in self-criticism and accepting criticism, honestly transforming themselves. In the past, some comrades could not understand criticisms raised by the masses that conformed to the actual situation for a long time. Now the atmosphere has changed, exposing problems without fear of pain, without concealing shortcomings, and without glossing over their faults; even the harshest opinions and those that deviate from the actual situation can be heard. Some comrades had problems in their thinking that they had already understood through studying Chairman Mao's works, but they still insisted on being strict with themselves in their thinking. At the "discussion and application meeting" (a meeting to discuss how to vigorously study and apply Chairman Mao's works) for organ cadres, they dug into their own thoughts and talked about their lessons. This change in the ideological understanding and learning attitude of leading cadres created a basic condition for studying Chairman Mao's works well and carrying out ideological revolutionization.
    The study of Chairman Mao's works and the transformation of thinking by leading cadres at the division level have some different characteristics from grassroots cadres and soldiers: they have been educated by the Party for a long time, have a solid ideological foundation, and have good internal factors for solving problems, but they neglect self-revolution, are prone to arrogance and complacency, and relax ideological transformation. Their thinking is relatively stable, and even if they cannot figure out some problems, they can mostly restrain themselves and "get by" according to lower standards, but if their ideological transformation is not thorough, it will always be reflected in the work of the entire division, which has a great impact. They occupy a leading position and are prone to self-righteousness. Based on these characteristics, the division's Party committee believes that the study and ideological transformation of leading cadres should emphasize awareness, while also creating conditions to promote their awareness. At the beginning of last year, based on past experience, they put forward "three" awarenesses to the Party committee members: consciously transforming their thinking, adhering to high standards and strict requirements; consciously practicing, taking practice as the standard for testing ideological transformation; consciously accepting the criticism and supervision of the Party organization and the masses, maintaining the true qualities of an ordinary soldier, an ordinary Party member, and an ordinary worker, closely contacting the masses, and learning from the masses. Actual conditions have proved that only by achieving "three" awarenesses can the transformation of thinking be thorough and in-depth. Some comrades used to have little contact with the masses, always thinking it was a problem of their personality. During the rectification of the work of the organs last year, after hearing everyone's criticism and restudying Chairman Mao's works, they re-recognized themselves, feeling that this personality problem had class character, was a problem of class feelings, and was a big problem of weak mass viewpoint. Later, he consciously corrected himself. In the organs, he took the initiative to visit cadres to talk with them, learned many things he did not understand, and enriched his mind. When he went to the companies, he ate, lived, and worked with the soldiers, put down his airs, and made friends with the soldiers, strengthening his proletarian feelings and improving the quality of staying at the grassroots level. There were also some comrades who thought that after more than 20 years of revolution, their original arrogance and complacency had been almost corrected. However, during the rectification of the work of the organs, everyone still criticized them for being arrogant and complacent. He studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind, sorted out his thoughts, summed up his experiences, and realized that the lesson in the past was that he had not practiced hard enough and had not corrected bit by bit. He learned and corrected at the same time, "starting from digging out small roots to digging out old roots," making great progress. Recently, everyone said that he "put down his airs and became modest," and "his self-righteousness has been greatly reduced, and he is able to admit his mistakes." Comparing the learning situation of this division's cadres in the past two years with the previous years, they realized that the consciousness of ideological transformation makes a big difference. With consciousness, they can learn Mao Zedong Thought, constantly discover problems, solve problems, constantly revolutionize, and constantly move forward; lacking this consciousness, they will not be able to see problems, they will not be able to do what they have learned, and they will not be able to correct what they know is wrong.
    When leading cadres study Chairman Mao's works and earnestly transform their thinking, they can use Mao Zedong Thought to command all their work. The deputy division commander of this division always vigorously studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, uses dialectical materialism to improve training work, and constantly makes discoveries and progresses. During the headquarters exercise, he used "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to break the frameworks and train the command organs to adapt to the complex and changeable situations on the battlefield. During the cadre tactical training, he changed the method of lecturing in the classroom and learning from books, leading everyone to drill, march, pass through the forest, and swim, improving everyone's political and ideological level and command ability from practice, and exploring a set of experiences for infantry companies to be able to move, attack, and manage their lives in mountainous and jungle areas. The logistics minister of this division used to manage materials but not people, but now he manages people first and then materials. He led the quartermaster training, first feeling out the ideological basis, organizing a small rectification campaign, using "Serve the People" and others as weapons, and using Sun Leyi as a mirror, solving the quartermasters' thoughts of fearing trouble, fearing difficulties, and fearing wrong accounts, mobilizing their enthusiasm for learning. During business learning, he also used "On Practice" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" as teaching materials, took the training team, carried the marching pot, climbed mountains and waded through water, and worked hard to practice field cooking. The comrades who participated in the training all said: "After going back, our work has direction and methods."
    "How the dragon's head swings determines how the dragon's tail wags." The division's leading cadres adhered to Mao Zedong Thought in their work, driving the vigorous study and application of Chairman Mao's works in all walks of life and in all departments. Some used Chairman Mao's works as basic teaching materials to educate reconnaissance detachments, achieving new results; some used the viewpoint of practice first and the two leaps in epistemology to guide stove improvements, solving the problem of saving coal; some used the viewpoint of active defense to prevent accidents, turning passivity into initiative. The training section used to fail to conduct training pilots well. Later, they used Chairman Mao's works as teaching materials and started by grasping ideology, which made the pilot a success and achieved successful experience, promoting the training of the troops. They said: "In the past, if we did not use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work, we would run into snags again and again; now, if we use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work, everything goes smoothly." Everyone realized that doing so gives action a direction, words and deeds a criterion, right and wrong a standard, and motivation to complete tasks.

    要用毛泽东思想统帅各项工作
    领导干部必须首先思想革命化
    昆明部队某师党委活学活用毛主席著作，加速了部队革命化、现代化建设
    编者按：毛泽东同志说过：“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用。”“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”
    按照毛泽东同志提出的标准来衡量，昆明部队某师党委的动作整齐不整齐呢？又整齐，又不整齐。多年来，他们坚持学习毛泽东同志的著作，动作是整齐的，所以工作是有成绩的。可是，有个时期，有些同志，由于种种原因，认为自己学习是为了教育部队，不是为了改造自己。缺少了学习的自觉性，工作就增加了盲目性。这样，大家的动作就不可能彻底整齐了。
    动作整齐，要有共同的思想基础，这就是毛泽东思想。大家都活学活用毛泽东思想，按照毛泽东同志的教导办事，就有了道理，有了方向，有了共同语言，有了工作准则。大家都有了这种革命自觉性，动作当然就会整齐了。
    “龙头怎样摆，龙尾怎样甩。”党委动作整齐，是整个部队动作整齐的前提。昆明部队某师党委抓紧自觉地学习毛泽东同志著作这个根本环节，把全师的一切工作带动起来，这是一个好经验。
    新华社昆明十日电　中国人民解放军昆明部队某师党委在活学活用毛主席著作中，狠抓党委成员和领导干部的思想革命化，取得了成绩，获得了经验。现在，这个师党委的成员，不仅养成了良好的自学习惯，而且普遍抓紧了思想改造，重视在自己分管的工作中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅。各机关、部队在他们的带动下，掀起了更大规模的活学活用毛主席著作热潮，加速了革命化、现代化建设。
    这个师党委坚持学习毛主席著作时间比较长，但是有个时期，有些同志认为，自己参加革命多年，工作还积极负责，又没有闹过问题，没有什么可改造的。他们把学习毛主席著作，改造思想，看成是战士和基层干部的事，而自己学习主要是为了教育部队、解决工作问题。由于有了这种看法，有些干部学习自觉性不高，针对性不强，许多工作中的问题挖不到根，也就不能从根本上解决。例如：他们在工作中较长时间存在着一般化的毛病。为什么一般化？过去他们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，只从作风和方法上找原因。认为工作所以一般化，主要是因为不善于抓典型、抓两头，深入实际不够，不能从实际出发贯彻上级的方针指示等等，而没有抓住领导思想上的问题。因此，懂得了要深入基层、亲自实践，有的同志还是不下连队；有的下去了，但是没有放下架子和战士打成一片，发现不了真实的问题；有些问题发现了，但是缺乏改造世界的雄心壮志，没有认真去解决；有的同志也和部队一起摸爬滚打，但是因为思想上还存在着主观片面、自以为是的毛病，总是要求客观实际符合自己的主观愿望，训练质量还是提不高。许多事实使他们认识到，正确的行动来源于正确的思想。自己头脑里有主观主义，有私心杂念，有怕苦畏难情绪，就不能正确地反映客观世界、改造客观世界。不用毛泽东思想改造自己，就不能真正按毛主席的指示办事，做好工作。
    如何抓党委成员的思想革命化？师党委从前年开始，通过学习毛主席四篇哲学著作，学习整风文献，学习先进单位和先进人物的经验，结合整顿机关工作、总结经验等，来反复提高大家思想革命的自觉性，使党委每个成员逐步认识到：领导干部决不能躺在“老”字上睡大觉，要永远对自己“一分为二”，承认自己要改造；毛主席著作是改造思想的根本武器，学习时思想不沾边，就永远学不到手；教育者应先受教育，改进工作要先改造思想，教育部队要先教育自己、改造自己；在用字上下功夫，首先要在改造思想上下功夫。认清了这些问题，这个师的领导干部中逐渐形成了一种新风气：敢于揭露问题，自以为非，勇于自我批评和接受批评，老老实实地改造自己。过去，有的同志对群众提出的、符合实际情况的批评，很长时间想不通。现在风气变了，揭露问题不怕痛，不隐讳缺点，不文过饰非；再刺耳的意见，和实际情况有出入的意见，也听得进去。有的同志思想上出现过的问题，本来自己通过学习毛主席著作想通了，但还是坚持思想从严，在机关干部“讲用会”（讲怎样活学活用毛主席著作会）上，自己挖思想，讲教训。领导干部思想认识和学习态度的这种变化，为学好毛主席著作大搞思想革命化，创造了一个基本条件。
    师一级的领导干部学习毛主席著作改造思想，有一些和基层干部、战士不同的特点：他们受党的教育时间长，思想底子厚，解决问题的内在因素好，但是忽视自我革命，容易骄傲自满，放松思想改造。他们的思想比较稳定，有些问题即使想不通，也多半能克制约束，按照低标准都还“过得去”，但是思想改造不彻底，总要反映到全师工作中来，影响大。他们居于领导地位，容易自以为是。根据这些特点，师党委认为，领导干部的学习和思想改造，更要强调自觉，同时又要创造条件，促其自觉。去年年初，他们根据以往的经验，向党委成员提出“三个”自觉：自觉改造思想，坚持高标准、严要求；自觉实践，把实践作为检验思想改造的标准；自觉接受党组织和群众的批评监督，保持普通一兵、普通党员、普通劳动者的本色，密切联系群众，向群众学习。实际情况证明，做到“三个”自觉，改造思想才能做到彻底、深入。有的同志过去和群众接近少，总认为是自己的性格问题。去年整顿机关工作时，听到大家的批评，再学习毛主席著作，重新认识自己，觉得这种性格问题有阶级性，是阶级感情问题，是群众观点薄弱的大问题。以后，他自觉地改正，在机关里，他主动上门找干部谈心，了解到许多自己不懂的问题，丰富了自己的头脑；下连队时，和战士同吃同住同劳动，放下架子和战士交朋友，增强了无产阶级感情，也提高了蹲点质量。还有的同志认为，自己经过二十多年革命，原先的骄傲自满情绪已经改得差不多了。可是，整顿机关工作时，大家批评的还是骄傲自满。他带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，整理思想，总结经验，认识到过去的教训是刻苦实践不够，一点一滴地改的不够。他边学边改，“从挖小根着手挖老根”，大有进步。最近大家说他“放下了架子，虚心了”，“自以为是大大减少，能够自以为非了”。这个师的干部把这两年的学习情况和前几年一对比，认识到思想改造自觉和不自觉，大不相同。有了自觉，就能学到毛泽东思想，不断发现问题，解决问题，不断革命，不断前进；缺乏这种自觉，就会有问题看不见，学了的做不到，知道错了的改不了。
    领导干部学习毛主席著作，认真地改造自己的思想，就能用毛泽东思想统帅各项工作。这个师的副师长时时处处活学活用毛主席著作，用辩证唯物论改进训练工作，不断有所发现，有所前进。在司令部演习时，他用《实践论》、《矛盾论》打破框框，锻炼了指挥机关适应战场上复杂多变情况的本领。在干部战术集训时，他改变了课堂讲、书上学的方法，带领大家演练、行军、穿林、泅渡，从实践中提高了大家政治思想水平和指挥能力，摸索出步兵连在山岳丛林地带开得动、攻得上和生活管理的一套经验。这个师的后勤部长过去管物不管人，现在是管物先管人。他领导司务长集训，先摸思想底，组织小整风，以《为人民服务》等为武器、以孙乐义当镜子，解决司务长们怕麻烦、怕困难、怕错账等思想，调动了学习积极性。在业务学习时，他又以《实践论》、《愚公移山》为教材，带上集训队，背起行军锅，爬山涉水，苦练战地野炊。参加集训的同志都说：“回去以后，工作有方向有办法了。”
    “龙头怎样摆，龙尾怎样甩”。师的领导干部在工作中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，带动了各行各业各个部门活学活用毛主席著作。他们有的以毛主席著作为基本教材，教育侦察分队，取得了新的成果；有的用实践第一、认识论上两个飞跃的观点指导改灶，解决了节约用煤的问题；有的把积极防御的观点用于预防事故，化被动为主动。训练科过去搞训练试点搞不好，后来以毛主席著作为教材，从抓思想入手，搞好了试点，取得了成功经验，推动了部队训练。他们说：“过去不用毛泽东思想指导工作，一碰再碰；现在用毛泽东思想指导工作，一通百通”。大家体会到：这样做，行动就有方向，言行就有准则，是非就有标准，完成任务就有动力。
