    To Serve the People, Remember the Words "Completely" and "Thoroughly"
    We Constantly Use the Words "Completely" and "Thoroughly" to Check Ourselves, Which Enables Our Work to Continuously Progress
    In recent years, under the education of the Party, I have come to understand that being a fitter is engaging in revolution, cleaning latrines is engaging in revolution, and raising pigs is also engaging in revolution; all work is engaging in revolution. In our country, there is only the idea of being lowly in position, not the idea of being lowly in work. However, how can we do revolutionary work even better? I believe that we must have the thought of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly."
    When I was a feeder, I resolved to raise the pigs well and serve the people wholeheartedly like Zhang Side. After several months of effort, the survival rate of piglets increased from over sixty percent to over eighty percent, most of the large pigs also grew fat, and the bell-ringing pigs could even assemble. At this time, I felt it was almost enough. Because I no longer looked forward, there was no new development in the pig raising work. Later, the leadership inspected the work and asked us to feed the pigs even better. The instructions of the leadership greatly enlightened us, indicating that some places that could be done better were not done well. Therefore, we re-studied "Serve the People," used the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to check ourselves, and found many common problems. Why couldn't we see these problems under our noses before? Our group discussed it back and forth, and believed that the fundamental problem was the lack of a single-minded devotion to the revolution. There were no high standards in our minds, and we lacked ambitious goals. Therefore, after achieving some success, we thought we had reached the "top." Therefore, I realized that establishing revolutionary and ambitious goals is the premise of continuous revolution, and constant comparison with Mao Zedong Thought is a guarantee of never being complacent. Later, we repeatedly used the words "completely" and "thoroughly" to check ourselves, which enabled the pig raising work to continuously progress.
    In order to make the pigs grow fat faster, we must first feed the pigs fully, but we cannot use grain. We dug wild vegetables, picked up vegetable leaves and roots, helped family members grind tofu, and did not charge wages, but only wanted the tofu dregs to feed the pigs. At first, the pigs did not like to eat it, so we conducted experiments, with several varieties in one meal, to see which one the pigs liked to eat, and we would make that one. Finally, we researched the method of feeding boars, sows, piglets, weak pigs, and sick pigs in separate troughs, so that they could all eat well and fully, and the pigs grew faster. But we were not satisfied with this, and we trained the pigs to get up to urinate and defecate when they heard the bell ringing in the middle of the night, established "files" for each pig, explored the laws of pig growth, disease, and heredity, and established a set of pig raising systems. This had a great effect on raising pigs well. Although the number of pig raisers was reduced by half, the number of pigs increased several times, the survival rate of piglets reached 95%, and the time to raise a fat pig was shortened by several months compared to the original.
    However, measured by "completely" and "thoroughly," our work is still far from enough, and we must continue the revolution, thoroughly revolution, and do the pig raising work even better.

    为人民要记住“完全”“彻底”四个字
    我们反复用“完全”“彻底”四个字对照检查自己，才使工作不断有所前进
    几年来，在党的教育下，使我懂得了，当钳工是干革命，掏大粪是干革命，喂猪同样是干革命，一切工作都是干革命。在我们国家里，只有低人一头的思想，没有低人一等的工作。可是，怎样把革命工作干得更好？我认为，必须要有“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想。
    我当饲养员时，就下定决心把猪养好，要象张思德那样老老实实地为人民服务。经过几个月的努力，猪崽成活率由百分之六十多，提高到百分之八十多，多数大猪也长肥了，而且敲钟猪还能集合。这时候，我觉得差不多了。由于不再朝前看了，养猪工作也就没有什么新发展。后来，领导检查工作，要求我们把猪喂得更好一些。领导的指示，对我们启发很大，说明有些可以搞得更好的地方没有搞好。于是，我们又重学《为人民服务》，用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神对照检查，找出许多常见的问题。为什么这些眼皮下的问题以前就看不见呢？我们组几个人讨论来讨论去，认为根本问题是缺乏一心为革命的思想。心里没有高标准，缺乏远大的目标，所以，干出一点成绩，就以为“到顶”了。因此，我体会到，树立革命的远大目标，是不断革命的前提，经常用毛泽东思想对照，是永不自满的保证。以后，我们反复用“完全”“彻底”四个字对照检查，才使养猪工作不断有所前进。
    为了让猪快些长肥，首先要叫猪吃饱，可是又不能用粮食喂，我们就挖野菜、拣菜叶菜根，帮家属磨豆腐，不收工钱，只要豆渣喂猪。开始，猪不爱吃，我们就搞试验，一顿几个花样，看猪喜欢吃那样，我们就做那样，终于研究出公猪、母猪、小猪、弱猪、病猪分槽饲养的方法，都能吃好吃饱，猪也长得快了。但我们并没有因此而满足，又训练猪半夜听见敲钟起来大小便，给每口猪建立“档案”，摸索猪的生长、疾病、遗传等规律，建立了一套养猪制度。这对养好猪的作用很大。养猪的人虽减少了一半，猪的数量却增加了几倍，猪崽的成活率达到百分之九十五，养一头肥猪的时间，比原来缩短了几个月。
    但是，用“完全”、“彻底”来衡量，我们的工作还差得很远，还要不断革命，彻底革命，把养猪工作搞得更好。
