    On January 24th, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a letter to Chairman Liu Shaoqi of our country and other heads of state. President Ho Chi Minh's letter sternly exposed the ugly face of the Johnson administration's false peace and true war, and reiterated that the Four Points are the only correct basis for solving the Vietnam problem. This firm stand embodies the ironclad determination of the 31 million Vietnamese people to carry the anti-American national salvation struggle to the end, and demonstrates the unwavering will of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the fatherland. The 650 million Chinese people express their full and resolute support for the just stand of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and for the Vietnamese people standing on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.
    For more than a month recently, the Johnson government, using the "suspension of bombing" as bait and the "Fourteen Points" proposal as its core, launched a so-called "peace" offensive, creating a murky and foul atmosphere. This is a grand deception aimed at extinguishing the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle through political deception, and a grand conspiracy to cover up its expansion of the war of aggression under the guise of "peace talks." In essence, all of this is aimed at forcing the Vietnamese people to submit to American force, to force the Vietnamese people to recognize America's right to occupy the South, and to force the Vietnamese people to abandon their sacred right to unify the fatherland. This arrogant ambition of American imperialism, to insult the dignity of the Vietnamese nation, to trample on the rights of the Vietnamese people, and to force the Vietnamese people to accept American "peace talk" conditions, cannot but arouse the boundless indignation of the Vietnamese people. President Ho Chi Minh declared in resounding terms: "The Vietnamese people will never yield to the threats of American imperialism at any time," "True peace cannot be separated from true independence. As long as there are American aggressor troops on our soil, our people will resolutely fight against them." This forceful answer from the Vietnamese people declares the shameful bankruptcy of the "peace talk" conspiracy of American imperialism and its accomplices.
    To solve the Vietnam problem, it is necessary to distinguish right from wrong. Who is the aggressor and who is the victim of aggression is not to be reversed. Who represents justice and who represents injustice is not to be confused. On the Vietnam issue, the United States is the aggressor, the culprit who tore up the Geneva Accords, and the criminal who launched and expanded the war of aggression. This is the primary premise and fundamental starting point that must be established for solving the Vietnam problem. Now, the United States not only refuses to admit that it is the aggressor, but instead says that North Vietnam "invaded" South Vietnam. Isn't this the height of absurdity!
    It is a matter of course for the people of North Vietnam to support the struggle of their southern compatriots, and it is a nation exercising its basic rights. But the American imperialists insist that the Vietnamese "invaded" Vietnam, which is a thorough and complete robber logic. No country or nation in the world will ever accept this absurd logic. It is only natural for the Vietnamese people to resolutely reject this robber logic of the United States, to safeguard the rights of the Vietnamese nation as a whole, to safeguard the rights of North and South Vietnam as one family, to unite as one, and to carry out the anti-American national salvation struggle.
    To solve the Vietnam problem, it is necessary to respect the will of the Vietnamese people. The Four Points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam express the will of the entire Vietnamese people and embody the spirit of the Geneva Accords. Acknowledging and implementing the Four Points is a sign of respecting Vietnamese sovereignty, a manifestation of fulfilling the Geneva Accords, and the only correct way to politically solve the Vietnam problem. For American imperialism, which is aggressing against Vietnam, this is a problem that must be followed, not a problem that can be bargained over.
    The South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the sole genuine representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam and the organizer and leader of the South Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle. It actually assumes and plays the role of state institutions in South Vietnam. For the American aggressors, if they truly want to peacefully resolve the Vietnam problem, if they truly respect the right of the South Vietnamese people to resolve their own affairs, they must recognize that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, and they must recognize the Five-Part Program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. This is also a problem that cannot be bargained over.
    Vietnam is the Vietnam of the Vietnamese people, not the Vietnam of the Americans. The United States has absolutely no right to occupy South Vietnam. The core of the Four Points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Five-Part Statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is to have American troops withdraw from the South. This is because the presence of American troops in South Vietnam is the pillar of the American policy of aggression against Vietnam, the root cause of destroying peace in Vietnam and Indochina and causing disaster in this region, and the fuse that threatens peace and security in Asia. In a word, without the withdrawal of American troops, there can be no talk of resolving the Vietnam problem, peace in Vietnam and Indochina cannot be realized at all, and there is no basic guarantee for peace and security in Asia.
    Now, the Johnson government fears recognizing that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people as much as the devil fears the sun, fears recognizing the Five-Part Statement of the National Liberation Front, and especially fears withdrawing its troops from South Vietnam. Johnson declared that the American national policy is to "definitely stay (in South Vietnam)," and Harriman brazenly said that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front "does not represent the people of the South." This means that although the United States can utter this or that "peace" rhetoric, its policy of occupying South Vietnam and turning South Vietnam into its new type of colony and military base will never change. This means that although the United States can make this or that "peace" gesture, its policy of suppressing the people of South Vietnam and extinguishing the flames of the South Vietnamese people's struggle will never change either.
    Over the past year, the Johnson government's record on the Vietnam issue is: one failure after another, one "peace talk" campaign after another, one batch of troop increases after another, and one step after another of war "escalation." This makes it easy for people to see such a pattern of the American aggressors: failure - playing with "peace talk" conspiracies - increasing troops again if the talks fail - failing again - playing with "peace talk" conspiracies again - increasing troops again if the talks fail again.
    This time, the Johnson government is still acting according to this pattern. The only difference is that American imperialism is preparing for a greater adventure, so the scale of this "peace talk" conspiracy is larger than any previous one. Now, this farce is nearing its end. The deployment for expanding the war is underway with great intensity. New reinforcements are successively heading to South Vietnam. New invading troops are being pieced together at home. A new record-breaking military budget has been proposed. New military orders are being rushed day and night. In South Vietnam, the "three alls" policy of burn all, kill all, and destroy all is being implemented madly, and American military bases are being built on a large scale and expanded rapidly. The bombing of North Vietnam is being prepared for expansion. The warmongering cries of Washington officials dispel the remaining "peace" smokescreen. As President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The American 'peace seeking' offensive is only to cover up its conspiracy to strengthen the war of aggression. The Johnson government's position remains aggression and expansion of the war." This is the truth.
    The Vietnamese people are a revolutionary people with a glorious

    坚定的立场　有力的回答
    一月二十四日，越南民主共和国主席胡志明致函我国刘少奇主席和其他各国首脑。胡志明主席的信，严正揭露了约翰逊政府假和平、真战争的丑恶面目，重申四项主张是解决越南问题的唯一正确基础。这一坚定的立场，体现了三千一百万越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的钢铁决心，表明了越南人民解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的不可动摇的意志。六亿五千万中国人民对于越南民主共和国政府的这一正义立场，对于站在反美斗争最前线的越南人民，表示全力的和坚决的支持。
    最近一个多月来，约翰逊政府以“暂停轰炸”为诱饵，以“十四点”主张为中心，发动了一个所谓“和平”大攻势，搞得乌烟瘴气，臭不可闻。这是一个妄图用政治欺骗手段扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的大骗局，是一个妄图用“和谈”的幌子掩盖它扩大侵略战争的大阴谋。这一切，实质上就是要越南人民在美国的武力面前屈服，就是要越南人民承认美国有权霸占南方，就是要越南人民放弃统一祖国的神圣权利。美帝国主义这种侮辱越南民族尊严、践踏越南民族权利、强迫越南人民接受美国“和谈”条件的狂妄野心，不能不激起越南人民的无比愤慨。胡志明主席以铿锵的词句宣告：“越南人民任何时候都绝不向美帝国主义的威胁屈服”，“真正的和平决不能离开真正的独立。只要我们的国土上还有美国侵略军，我国人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗”。越南人民的这一有力的回答，宣告了美帝国主义及其合伙者的“和谈”阴谋的可耻破产。
    要解决越南问题，必须分清是非。谁是侵略者，谁是被侵略者，是不容颠倒的。谁代表正义，谁代表非正义，是不容混淆的。在越南问题上，美国是侵略者，是撕毁日内瓦协议的祸首，是发动和扩大侵略战争的罪犯。这是解决越南问题必须确立的首要前提和基本出发点。现在，美国不仅不承认自己是侵略者，反而说越南北方“侵略”越南南方，这不是荒唐之极吗！
    越南北方人民支持自己南方同胞的斗争，是天经地义，是一个民族行使自己的基本权利。而美帝国主义硬说越南人“侵略”了越南，是一种彻头彻尾的强盗逻辑。全世界任何一个国家和民族，都绝不会接受这种荒谬的逻辑。越南人民断然拒绝美国的这一强盗逻辑，维护越南民族是一个整体的权利，维护越南南北是一家的权利，团结一致，进行抗美救国斗争，是理所当然的。
    要解决越南问题，必须尊重越南人民的意志。越南民主共和国的四项主张，表达了全体越南人民的意志，体现了日内瓦协议的精神。承认和履行四项主张，是尊重越南主权的标志，是履行日内瓦协议的表现，是政治解决越南问题的唯一正确途径。对于侵略越南的美帝国主义来说，这是一个必须照办的问题，而不是一个可以讨价还价的问题。
    越南南方民族解放阵线是一千四百万越南南方人民的唯一真正代表，是越南南方人民进行抗美救国斗争的组织者和领导者。它实际上在越南南方担负着和发挥着国家机构的作用。对于美国侵略者来说，如果真正要和平解决越南问题，如果真正尊重越南南方人民解决自己事务的权利，就必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一合法代表，就必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线的五点纲领。这也是一个不容讨价还价的问题。
    越南，是越南人民的越南，不是美国人的越南。美国根本无权占领南越。越南民主共和国四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明的核心，就是要美国军队撤出南方。这是因为，美国军队呆在南越，是美国推行侵略越南政策的支柱，是破坏越南和印度支那和平、造成这一地区灾难的总根源，是威胁亚洲和平和安全的导火线。一句话，美国军队不撤，越南问题的解决就无从谈起，越南和印度支那的和平就根本不能实现，亚洲的和平和安全就没有起码的保证。
    现在，约翰逊政府象魔鬼害怕太阳一样，害怕承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一合法代表，害怕承认民族解放阵线的五点声明，特别害怕从越南南方撤军。约翰逊宣称美国的国策是“一定要（在南越）留下来”，哈里曼死皮赖脸地说越南南方民族解放阵线“不代表南方人民”。这就是说，美国尽管可以说出这种或那种“和平”的言词，但是，它霸占南越、把南越变成它的新型殖民地和军事基地的政策是决不会改变的。这就是说，美国尽管可以做出这样或那样的“和平”姿态，但是，它镇压南越人民，扑灭南越人民斗争烈火的政策也是决不会改变的。
    一年来，约翰逊政府在越南问题上的记录是：一个接一个的失败，一次又一次的“和谈”活动，一批又一批的增兵，一步跟一步的战争“升级”。这就使人们不难看出美国侵略者的这样一种规律：失败——玩弄“和谈”阴谋——谈不成再增兵——再失败——再玩弄“和谈”阴谋——再谈不成再增兵。
    这一次，约翰逊政府还是按照这个规律行事。所不同的是，美帝国主义正在准备一场更大的冒险，因此，这次“和谈”阴谋的规模比以往历次都大。现在，这场丑剧已经接近尾声。扩大战争的部署正在紧张进行。新的增援部队陆续开往南越。新的侵略军正在国内拼凑。新的破纪录的军事预算已经提出。新的军事订货正在日夜赶造。在南越，烧光、杀光、毁光的“三光”政策正在疯狂推行，美国的军事基地正在大兴土木、加紧扩建。对越南北方的轰炸，正准备扩大进行。华盛顿官员的好战叫嚣，驱散了残存的“和平”烟幕。正如胡志明主席所指出的：“美国的‘寻求和平’攻势只是为了掩饰其加强侵略战争的阴谋。约翰逊政府的立场依然是侵略和扩大战争”。事实就是这样。
    越南人民是具有反帝斗争光荣传统的革命人民，是在反美斗争中取得了辉煌胜利和丰富经验的英雄人民。他们不被美帝国主义的战争威胁所吓倒，也不被美帝国主义的花言巧语所迷惑。他们立下誓言，不把美国侵略者赶出国土，不完成祖国的完全解放和最后统一，就决不停止战斗。在这样伟大的、敢于斗争的人民面前，美帝国主义只是一只纸老虎。越南的战局，过去、现在和将来，都不会按照美国侵略者的意志发展。事实已经并将继续证明，美国军队派的越多，越南人民的胜利越大。不论美国把战争扩大到什么程度，不论美国把战争扩大到那里，最后都将以失败而告终。别的前途是没有的。
