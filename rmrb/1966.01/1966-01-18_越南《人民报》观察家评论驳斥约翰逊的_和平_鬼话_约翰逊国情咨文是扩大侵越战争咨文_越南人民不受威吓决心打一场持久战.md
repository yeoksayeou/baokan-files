    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 17th: The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published an "Observer" commentary on the 16th, pointing out that U.S. President Johnson's State of the Union address on January 12th demonstrates that the U.S. aggressors have shown no intention of resolving the Vietnam problem according to the most correct path already pointed out to them by the Vietnamese people, and that they are intensifying and expanding the war of aggression. Therefore, the Vietnamese people are determined to strengthen their sacred cause of resisting America and saving the nation, and to crush all new adventurous plans and aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary pointed out that Johnson's State of the Union address is part of the "peace offensive" clamored by the U.S. ruling clique. Despite the different forms from previous statements by the U.S. ruling clique, it remains a statement filled with contradictions and possessing a strong colonialist and war-like odor.
    The commentary said that facts have proven that every time the U.S. aggressors clamor and launch so-called "peace talk" offensives to resolve the Vietnam problem, they take further measures to intensify the war. This time, they are talking about "peace negotiations" in the most concentrated and loudly publicized manner.
    However, this time, the U.S. imperialists are also intensifying their war of aggression in the most frenzied manner and with the most barbaric means. They are continuously transporting troops and war materials to South Vietnam. U.S. generals are shuttling back and forth in Saigon, formulating new military adventure plans. The U.S. aggressors are committing more crimes, such as openly implementing "scorched earth" policies and "burn all, destroy all, kill all" policies in places like Tân An - Chợ Lớn, Da Nang, Bình Định, Thủ Dầu Một, and Cần Thơ. They are using chemical poisons and gases on a large scale, bombing residential areas on a large scale, and treating these practices as their "established principle." They are also intensifying the bombing of Laos, threatening to send U.S. troops into Laos, and brazenly authorizing U.S. troops and their puppet troops to invade Cambodian territory.
    The commentary emphasized that all these actions of the U.S. aggressors expose the deceitfulness of their "peace offensive" and demonstrate that they are frantically intensifying and expanding their war of aggression in Vietnam and throughout Indochina. No matter how grandly they adorn their statements, they cannot conceal their aggressive and bellicose stance.
    The commentary pointed out that despite the disastrous political and military defeats suffered by the U.S. aggressors, they stubbornly refuse to leave South Vietnam, seeking to realize their conspiracy to turn South Vietnam into a new type of colony and military base for the U.S., and to permanently divide Vietnam. Johnson claims that the U.S. "seeks no territory, no bases, no economic control, and no military alliances" in South Vietnam, but at the same time he says that the U.S. "must stay" in South Vietnam, "must stay until the aggression stops," and that he will fulfill the "obligations" the U.S. has undertaken to the Saigon traitorous clique, and that he "will remove his forces" "once South Vietnam decides that the right of its own future is reliably guaranteed." These statements expose Johnson's sinister nature. That is to say, the U.S. is determined to remain in South Vietnam and maintain the regime of the U.S. imperialist lackeys in Saigon. This means that he wants the people of South Vietnam to lay down their arms and surrender. It is very clear that the U.S. aggressors stubbornly stand on the side of colonialism and have consistently refused to recognize the four-point position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which embodies the most basic principles of the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue.
    The commentary said that Johnson said that he would continue his "peace efforts," "try to limit the conflict," and "wait for developments that lead to peace." But on the other hand, he reaffirmed that the U.S. is prepared for a "long-term battle" and that he will "give his combatants what they must get." He emphasized that his first principle is the "principle of strength," and he announced that he would use $5.8 billion, or even more money, for the Vietnam War. At the same time, he brazenly threatened the Vietnamese people, saying that they can only "choose between peace and desolation." Johnson's words and the actual actions of the U.S. ruling clique show that the U.S. aggressors are stubbornly pursuing and expanding their war of aggression. They are arrogantly issuing an ultimatum to the Vietnamese people. Johnson also claimed that the U.S. "does not intend to abandon Asia," which further exposes the conspiracy of the U.S. aggressors to expand their war of aggression in Asia.
    The commentary said that the U.S. aggressors can talk about peace thousands of times, but if they refuse to abandon their aggressive conspiracies, then no problem can be solved. The main obstacle lies here, because the root cause and direct cause of the current situation in Vietnam is precisely the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary said that as long as the U.S. imperialists abandon their aggressive and colonialist plans, stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam and the destructive war against the North, withdraw all their troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own affairs, peace will come immediately. As the four-point position of our government and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front have already pointed out, this is the most correct way to solve the Vietnam problem.
    The commentary emphasized that the U.S. aggressors still adhere to their colonialist stance. They are increasing war expenditures and blindly going down the path of intensifying and expanding the war in our country and throughout Indochina. They arrogantly demand that our people surrender and shamelessly threaten our people. We are determined to strengthen our sacred cause of resisting America and saving the nation, and to crush all their new adventurous plans and aggressive conspiracies. Our people know from experience that the imperialist aggressors will only abandon their aggressive ambitions after suffering disastrous defeats on the battlefield, only when they cannot continue to fight and their aggressive ambitions are shattered. U.S. imperialism is now mired in the quagmire and is about to drown, but they have not yet awakened. They are still baring their fangs and claws to threaten others. Our people are determined to constantly heighten their vigilance, prepare to overcome all difficulties and hardships, and resolutely fight until final victory.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the struggle of our people in both the North and South to resist America and save the nation has achieved great victories. The U.S. aggressors have suffered disastrous defeats. They themselves admit that a year of "gradual escalation" has only brought them failure and a dim future, with a dead end ahead. The more the U.S. aggressors expand the war, the more disastrous their defeat will be. In order to realize the independence and freedom of the motherland, our people are determined to fight a protracted war until final victory.

### 越南《人民报》观察家评论驳斥约翰逊的“和平”鬼话  约翰逊国情咨文是扩大侵越战争咨文  越南人民不受威吓决心打一场持久战

    越南《人民报》观察家评论驳斥约翰逊的“和平”鬼话
    约翰逊国情咨文是扩大侵越战争咨文
    越南人民不受威吓决心打一场持久战
    新华社河内十七日电　越南《人民报》十六日发表一篇“观察家”评论指出，美国总统约翰逊一月十二日发表的国情咨文表明，美国侵略者丝毫没有表示出他们打算按照越南人民已经向他们指出的最正确的途径解决越南问题，他们正在加剧和扩大侵略战争。因此，越南人民决心加强神圣的抗美救国事业，粉碎美帝国主义的一切新的冒险计划和侵略阴谋。
    评论指出，约翰逊的国情咨文是美国统治集团叫嚷的“和平攻势”的一部分。它同美国统治集团以前各次声明尽管形式有所不同，但它仍然是一个充满了矛盾、有着强烈的殖民主义和战争气味的声明。
    评论说，事实证明，美国侵略者每次叫嚷而发动所谓解决越南问题的“和谈”攻势时，他们就进一步采取措施来加剧战争。这一次，他们用最集中的和大肆喧嚣的方式侈谈“和平谈判”。
    但是，这一次，美帝国主义者也以最疯狂的方式，用最野蛮的手段加剧他们的侵略战争。他们不断增运军队和战争物资到越南南方。美国将领们穿梭般地在西贡进进出出，制定新的军事冒险计划。美国侵略者正在犯下更多的罪行，如在新安—堤岸、岘港、平定、土龙木和芹苴等地公然实行“焦土”政策和“烧光、毁光、杀光”政策。他们大规模使用化学毒剂和毒气，大规模轰炸居民区，并把这些作法作为他们的“既定原则”。他们还加紧轰炸老挝，扬言要把美国军队开进老挝，并悍然授权美国军队及其仆从军队侵入柬埔寨领土。
    评论强调指出，美国侵略者的所有这些行径暴露了他们的“和平攻势”的欺骗性，并表明他们正在疯狂地加紧和扩大他们在越南和整个印度支那的侵略战争。不管他们把自己的声明装饰得多么堂皇，也掩盖不了他们的侵略和好战立场。
    评论指出，尽管美国侵略者在政治上和军事上遭到惨败，但是他们仍顽固地赖在越南南方不走，要实现把越南南方变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地、长期分裂越南的阴谋。约翰逊声称美国在南越“既不谋求领土、基地、也不谋求经济控制或军事同盟”，但是他同时说，美国在南越“一定要留下来”，“一定要留到侵略停止为止”，他说，他要履行美国对西贡卖国集团承担的“义务”，“一旦南越决定它自己前途的权利得到可靠的保证”，他“将撤出他的军队”。这些说法暴露了约翰逊的阴险的本性。这就是说，美国决心赖在越南南方，保持西贡的美帝国主义走狗的政权。这意味着，他要越南南方人民必须放下武器投降。十分清楚的是，美国侵略者顽固地站在殖民主义的立场上，一直拒绝承认体现了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议最基本的原则的越南民主共和国政府的四项主张。
    评论说，约翰逊说什么他要继续进行他的“和平努力”，要“尽力把冲突限制住”和“等待着导向和平的发展”。但是另方面，他重申美国准备“长期战斗”，要“使他的战斗人员得到他们必须得到的东西”。他强调说，他的第一个原则是“实力原则”，他宣布他要把五十八亿美元，甚至更多的钱，用于越南战争。同时，他悍然威胁越南人民说，他们只能在“和平和荒凉之间作出选择”。约翰逊说的话和美国统治集团的实际行动表明，美国侵略者正在顽固地推行和扩大他们的侵略战争。他们蛮横地向越南人民提出最后通牒。约翰逊还声称美国“不打算放弃亚洲”，这进一步暴露了美国侵略者要扩大他们在亚洲的侵略战争的阴谋。
    评论说，美国侵略者可以千百次地大谈和平，但是，如果他们拒绝放弃他们的侵略阴谋，那么任何问题都是解决不了的。主要的障碍就在这里，因为造成目前越南局势的根源和直接原因恰恰是美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    评论说，只要美帝国主义者放弃他们的侵略和殖民主义计划，停止对越南南方的侵略战争和对北方的破坏性战争，从越南南方撤出他们的全部军队和武器，让越南人民自己解决他们的事务，和平将会立即到来。正如我国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明早已指出的那样，这是解决越南问题的最正确的途径。
    评论强调说，美国侵略者仍然坚持他们的殖民主义立场。他们正在增加战费，盲目地在我国和整个印度支那加剧和扩大战争的道路上走下去。他们蛮横地要求我国人民投降，无耻地威胁我国人民。我们决心加强我们神圣的抗美救国事业，粉碎他们一切新的冒险计划和侵略阴谋。我国人民根据经验知道，帝国主义侵略者只有在战场上遭到惨败，只有在他们不能继续打下去和他们的侵略野心被粉碎之后，他们才会放弃侵略野心。美帝国主义现在陷在泥淖中快要没顶了，但是他们还没有醒悟过来。他们还张牙舞爪地威胁别人。我国人民决心不断提高警惕，准备克服一切艰难困苦，坚决战斗下去，直到赢得最后胜利。
    评论最后说，我国南北两方人民抗美救国的斗争已经取得伟大胜利。美国侵略者已经遭到惨败。他们自己承认，一年的“逐步升级”只给他们带来了失败和暗淡的前途，前面是死胡同。美国侵略者越是扩大战争，他们的失败就将越惨重。为了实现祖国的独立和自由，我国人民决心打一场持久战，直到取得最后胜利。
