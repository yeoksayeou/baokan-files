    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Washington: The American newspaper, *The Washington Post*, in a report on the current situation in the Dominican Republic on December 26th of last year, admitted that the intervention of the United States and the Organization of American States in the Dominican Republic had suffered a "depressing failure."
    The report admitted that, despite the direct dispatch of troops by the United States after the outbreak of the revolution in the Dominican Republic last April, the provision of large amounts of dollar aid to Dominican puppets, and the plotting to establish a "provisional government," "all of this has failed to halt a political fervor that appears to be sweeping the country."
    The report said that since the large-scale strike of Dominican sugar workers on December 13th, "angry crowds have been constantly demonstrating in the streets of Santo Domingo and Santiago, often clashing with the Pan-American forces, and gunshots and explosions can be heard day and night."
    The report pointed out that "the precarious stability of the Godoy provisional government is constantly threatened. This government does not have the support of the people… the people hate Godoy because he was effectively appointed by the Organization of American States and the United States." The report admitted that the Dominican leftist forces "have made considerable gains in the past eight months," and their influence among the people is growing.

    多米尼加左派力量的影响日益增长
    美报哀叹美帝对多米尼加的干涉遭到“令人沮丧的失败”
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国《华盛顿邮报》在去年十二月二十六日报道多米尼加目前局势时承认，美国和美洲国家组织对多米尼加的干涉遭到“令人沮丧的失败”。
    这篇报道承认，尽管在去年四月多米尼加爆发革命之后，美国直接派兵进行了干涉，向多米尼加傀儡提供了大量美元的援助，并且策划建立了一个“临时政府”，但是“所有这一切都没有能够阻止一个看来会席卷全国的政治热潮”。
    报道说，自从十二月十三日多米尼加糖业工人举行大规模的罢工以来，“愤怒的人群不断在圣多明各和圣地亚哥街道上举行示威，经常发生同泛美部队展开冲突的事件，日夜都可以听到枪声和爆炸声”。
    报道指出，“戈多伊临时政府的岌岌可危的稳定经常受到威胁，这个政府得不到人民的支持，……人民痛恨戈多伊，因为他实际上是由美洲国家组织和美国任命的”。报道承认，多米尼加左派力量“在过去八个月中取得了相当大的阵地”，他们在人民中的影响日益增大。
