    Editor's Note: Dazhai and some Dazhai-style advanced units are, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, using the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to comprehensively analyze their own achievements and shortcomings, and seek directions and measures for continued progress. Facts have proven that no matter how advanced a unit is, there are always weak links and potential for further development. To overcome weak links and tap existing potential so that production can "climb to a higher level," the first step is to elevate thinking to "a higher level." Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, adhere to the principle of great enthusiasm and steady steps, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to the greatest extent, we will surely be able to create even greater achievements in this year's production.
    Xin Feng Brigade Learns from Dazhai's Fundamentals:
    Build a Dazhai-Style Party Branch, Cultivate Good Dazhai-Style Commune Members
    Last winter, Cui Zhusong, the captain of Xin Feng Brigade of Changbai Commune in Yanji City, Jilin Province—one of the Dazhai-style agricultural model units and a national rice production model—visited the Dazhai-style typical exhibition in Beijing and listened to Chen Yonggui's report. After returning, he conveyed the message to all commune members, setting off a wave of enthusiasm for learning from Dazhai. After many discussions, the brigade's Party branch believed that to learn from Dazhai, it is necessary to build the Party branch into a Dazhai-style branch and cultivate commune members into Dazhai-style people. The Party branch leads the commune members to carry out preparatory work for spring plowing and production according to high standards, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    Xin Feng Brigade has achieved stable and high yields for eight consecutive years. Some people have developed the idea that production has almost reached its limit, measures have been taken to the fullest extent, and potential has been almost completely tapped. This time, compared with the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people, everyone realized that they were far from reaching that level. The main gap is that the Party branch has not yet become a Dazhai-style Party branch, and therefore, it has not used the spirit of continuous revolution to lead the commune members in vigorously grasping farmland capital construction, so the rice yield per mu has been unable to break through the level of 800 jin for eight years.
    After discussion, the cadres and commune members of this brigade resolved to demand more of themselves according to higher standards. They decided to complete all the projects of digging drainage ditches, repairing river embankments, and leveling land within one to three years, according to the requirements of high standards. Since last winter, cadres and commune members have taken the Dazhai people as their role models, braving the severe cold and stepping on ice to actively carry out farmland capital construction and preparatory work for spring plowing and production.

### 新丰大队学大寨的根本  建设大寨式党支部  培养大寨式好社员

    编者按：大寨和一些大寨式的先进单位，正在根据毛主席的教导，用一分为二的观点，对本单位的成绩和缺点，进行全面的分析，寻求继续前进的方向和措施。事实证明，不管多么先进的单位，总还有薄弱的环节，还有继续发展的潜力。要克服薄弱的环节，发掘既有的潜力，使生产“更上一层楼”，首先要使思想“更上一层楼”。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持干劲要大、步子要稳的原则，把群众的积极性最大限度地调动起来，就一定能够使今年的生产创造出更大的成绩。
    新丰大队学大寨的根本
    建设大寨式党支部  培养大寨式好社员
    去年冬天，大寨式农业典型单位之一——吉林省延吉市长白公社新丰大队队长、全国水稻丰产模范崔竹松，到北京参观了大寨式的典型展览，听了陈永贵的报告。回去以后，他向全体社员作了传达，掀起学习大寨的热潮。大队党支部经过多次讨论，认为学大寨，必须把党支部建设成大寨式的支部，把社员培养成为大寨式的人。党支部领导社员群众按高标准进行备耕生产，争取今年农业丰收。
    新丰大队连续八年稳产高产。有些人产生了产量上得差不多，措施搞得差不多，潜力挖得差不多的思想。这次和大寨人的革命精神一对照，大家才认识到不是差不多，而是差得多。主要的差距是：党支部还没有成为大寨式的党支部，因此没有用不断革命的精神，带领社员群众狠抓农田基本建设，水稻亩产量八年来一直突不破八百多斤的水平。
    经过讨论，这个大队的干部和社员决心以更高标准要求自己。他们决定在一至三年内，按照高标准的要求分别完成挖排水沟、修河堤和平整土地的全部工程。去冬以来，干部和社员群众以大寨人为榜样，冒着严寒，踏着冰碴，积极进行农田基本建设和备耕生产。
