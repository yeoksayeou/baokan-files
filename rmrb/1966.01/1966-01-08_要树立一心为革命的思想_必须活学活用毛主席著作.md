    To Establish the Thought of Serving the Revolution Heart and Soul, It is Necessary to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works in a Living Way
    Advanced Workers in Various Industries in Tibet, with the Whole Country in Mind and a Global Perspective, are Determined to Build Tibet Even Better
    Recently, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Tibet Autonomous Region Committee convened a symposium on "Studying Chairman Mao's Works and Doing All Work for the Revolution." The symposium held that Tibet has now entered a new period of socialist revolution and construction, and the thinking of the vast number of cadres and workers must adapt to the requirements of the new revolutionary situation and tasks, and strive to achieve revolutionization. To study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and to establish a world view of serving the revolution heart and soul and everything for the revolution, is a fundamental measure for realizing ideological revolutionization.
    The majority of those attending the symposium were advanced figures from all walks of life in Lhasa. Among them were cooks, barbers, childcare workers, mail carriers, typists, gatekeepers, police officers, dispatchers, salespeople, communications workers, doctors, nurses, as well as workers, soldiers, educators, and government cadres from various trades. More than sixty comrades spoke at the symposium, and the responsible comrades of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Tibet Autonomous Region Committee also spoke at the symposium.
    The comrades who attended the symposium pointed out that the *People's Daily* editorial of October 11, "All Work is for the Revolution," is of great significance. Like the rest of the country, Tibet's socialist education movement is proceeding victoriously on all fronts, and the struggle of proletarian ideology against bourgeois ideology, and the struggle of the socialist road against the capitalist road, are developing in depth in the political, economic, cultural, and ideological fields. More and more people are linking their daily labor, work, and study with distant revolutionary goals and with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The idea that "all work is for the revolution" is gradually taking root in the hearts of the people.
    The comrades present used many facts to prove that the idea of "all work is for the revolution" is a requirement of the times and the motherland for the broad masses and cadres, and a fighting call issued by the Party under the new revolutionary situation. However, not everyone has realized this ideologically. At the same time, many old ideas, old concepts, and old habits of capitalism and feudalism are constantly impacting the ideological front of the proletariat. Thus, carrying out activities of studying and discussing "Studying Chairman Mao's Works and Doing All Work for the Revolution" among the broad masses of cadres and workers in the Tibet Autonomous Region will help to highlight politics, further clarify the socialist direction, and promote the ideological revolutionization of cadres and workers.
    At the symposium, many comrades used moving deeds to illustrate that, with the idea of "all work is for the revolution" established, they can carry out their work creatively in different work posts. Zhang Jian, a cook at the Lhasa Trading Company, put it well: "Revolution cannot be separated from cooking. If I cook well and let everyone eat well and have plenty of energy to work, I can make a greater contribution to the revolution." He implemented this understanding into action. He overcame difficulties, learned to grind tofu, increased the soybean pulp yield, and improved the food. With the idea of "all work is for the revolution" established, one can avoid being picky about work, do whatever the Party asks, dare to struggle, be good at struggling, not be afraid of difficulties, and be full of vigor. Comrade Wang Tao, a Lhasa Cement Plant administrator who came to Tibet after graduating from the Architectural Department of Wuhan Urban Construction Institute, said: "We are proletarian revolutionaries, and the needs of the Party and the needs of the revolution are our own aspirations; serving the people should be unconditional, which is the most practical manifestation of our loyalty to the revolution and loyalty to the people." After Wang Tao came to Tibet, he did general affairs work due to the needs of the revolution, managing the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of all employees, as well as pigs, sheep, horses, and cattle. At first, he couldn't get his head around these tasks. But he had a belief: "The needs of the Party and the needs of the revolution are my battle position." Thus, he followed Chairman Mao's instructions, explored the contradictions and laws in his work, studied diligently, and finally became a good housekeeper for the Lhasa Cement Plant. With the idea of "all work is for the revolution" established, one can be based on one's own post, have the whole country in mind, have a global perspective, take root in the plateau, and build Tibet for a long time. Comrade Zun Zhu, a gatekeeper at the Lhasa Department Store, said: "When I started working in 1956, I only thought about working hard to earn more money so that I could live a good life. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people wholeheartedly. I realized that only when all the working people of Tibet and the working people of the world live a good life, can my good life get better and better. I realized that I should contribute my strength to the people of Tibet, the people of the whole country, and the working people of the world." Li Ruming, a worker at the Lhasa Cement Plant, also said: "Tibet is the frontier of our great motherland. Tibet is 'poor and blank.' We come to Tibet for the revolution. I want to use my own hands and the Tibetan working people together to change the poor and backward situation and contribute all my strength to building a new socialist Tibet."
    All the speakers at the symposium unanimously pointed out that, to establish a proletarian world view of serving the revolution heart and soul, one must adopt an honest attitude, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, constantly transform one's thinking, and consciously labor, work, and study for the revolution. When talking about their own progress, and when talking about the achievements they have made in their work, many comrades unanimously believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the milk that nurtured their growth; Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for all their work to achieve victory. The conclusion they have drawn from their own practice is that, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and to make great efforts in the word "use," is the fundamental guarantee for realizing revolutionization and becoming a conscious revolutionary. Mail carrier Tudeng said in his speech with his own personal experience: "I used to deliver some Tibetan letters untimely. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that I should serve the people wholeheartedly, but I myself had not served the people wholeheartedly. After I clarified this point, I thought that in the past, the Tibetan working people had no right to send letters at all. Today, they have this right and the ability to write letters. Is it not the victory of Mao Zedong Thought in Tibet that I can deliver letters for them? After figuring this out, I treated every Tibetan letter with strong class feelings, and tried every means to quickly and safely deliver every letter to the recipient."
    The comrades present widely exchanged experiences and insights in studying Chairman Mao's works, learned from each other, and improved together. They said that the symposium itself was a revolutionary meeting, a meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Many people at the meeting, in connection with Chairman Mao's teachings and the great spirit of Comrade Wang Jie, who served the revolution heart and soul, fearing neither hardship nor death, compared and examined their own thoughts and actions, found shortcomings, clarified directions, and were determined to continuously revolutionize themselves and always revolutionize themselves, vowing to be a true conscious revolutionary, and contribute their greatest strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

    要树立一心为革命的思想  必须活学活用毛主席著作
    西藏各行业先进工作者胸怀全国，放眼世界，决心把西藏建设得更好
    最近，中共西藏自治区委员会宣传部召开了“学习毛主席著作，一切工作为革命”的座谈会。这次座谈会认为：目前西藏已经进入了社会主义革命和建设的新时期，广大干部和职工的思想必须适应新的革命形势和任务的要求，努力实现革命化。活学活用毛主席著作，树立一心为革命，一切为革命的世界观，正是实现思想革命化的一项根本措施。
    参加这次座谈会的，绝大部分是拉萨各行各业中的先进人物。他们中间有炊事员、理发员、保育员、投递员、打字员、守门员、民警、传达、营业员、通讯员、医生、护士，以及各工种的工人、战士、教育工作者和机关干部。座谈会上，六十多位同志发了言，中共西藏自治区委员会宣传部负责同志也在座谈会上讲了话。
    参加座谈会的同志指出：《人民日报》十月十一日社论《一切工作都是为了革命》，具有重要的意义。西藏也和全国一样，社会主义教育运动正在各个战线上胜利进行，无产阶级思想对资产阶级思想的斗争，社会主义道路对资本主义道路的斗争，正在政治、经济、文化和思想领域深入地开展。越来越多的人把自己的日常劳动、工作和学习，同远大的革命目标联系起来，同中国革命和世界革命联系起来。“一切工作都是为了革命”的思想，正在逐步深入人心。
    到会的同志用许多事实证明：“一切工作都是为了革命”的思想，是时代和祖国对广大群众和干部提出的要求，是党在新的革命形势下发出的战斗号召。但是，有些人在思想上并不是都认识到了这一点。同时，资本主义和封建主义的许多旧思想、旧观念、旧习惯，还无时无刻不在冲击着无产阶级的思想阵地。这样，在西藏自治区广大干部、职工中，开展学习和讨论“学习毛主席著作，一切工作为革命”的活动，就有助于突出政治，进一步明确社会主义方向，促进干部、职工的思想革命化。
    在座谈会上，许多同志用动人的事迹说明，树立了“一切工作都是为了革命”的思想，就能在不同的工作岗位上，创造性地进行工作。拉萨贸易公司炊事员张健说得好：“革命离不开做饭的。我把饭做好了，让大家吃饱吃好，精力充沛地去工作，就能为革命做出更多的贡献。”他把这个认识贯彻到行动中去。他克服困难，学会了磨豆腐，提高了黄豆出浆率，改进了伙食。树立了“一切工作都是为了革命”的思想，就能在工作中，不挑肥拣瘦，做到党叫干啥就干啥，敢于斗争，善于斗争，不怕困难，朝气蓬勃。从武汉城市建设学院建筑系毕业来到西藏的拉萨水泥厂管理员王韬同志说：“我们是无产阶级的革命者，党的需要、革命的需要就是自己的志愿；为人民服务应当是无条件的，这是我们忠于革命、忠于人民的最实际的表现。”王韬同志到西藏后，由于革命的需要，做了总务工作，管理着全厂职工的衣食住行、猪羊马牛。开始，他对这些工作摸不到头脑。可是他有一个信念：“党的需要，革命的需要，就是我的战斗岗位。”这样，他就按照毛主席的指示，摸索工作中的矛盾和规律，苦钻苦学，终于成了拉萨水泥厂的一位好管家。树立了“一切工作都是为了革命”的思想，就能做到，立足本岗位，胸怀全国，放眼世界，扎根高原，长期建设西藏。拉萨百货公司守门员遵珠同志就是这样说的：“我在一九五六年参加工作时，只想到努力工作，多挣些钱，能过上好日子。后来，学习了毛主席的著作，毛主席教导我们全心全意为人民服务。我才想到，只有全西藏劳动人民和全世界劳动人民都过上好日子，我的好日子才能越过越好。我才知道我应该为西藏人民、全国人民和全世界的劳动人民贡献自己的力量。”拉萨水泥厂工人李汝明也说：“西藏是我们伟大祖国的边疆。西藏是‘一穷二白’的。我们来西藏是为了革命。我要用自己的双手和西藏劳动人民一起，改变贫穷落后面貌，为建设社会主义的新西藏贡献自己的全部力量。”
    参加座谈会的所有发言人都一致指出：要树立一心为革命的无产阶级世界观，一定要采取老老实实的态度，活学活用毛主席著作，不断地改造思想，自觉地为革命而劳动、工作和学习。许多同志在谈到自己的进步时，在谈到自己工作取得一些成就时，都一致认为：毛泽东思想，是哺育他们成长的乳汁；毛泽东思想，是他们一切工作能够取得胜利的指南。他们从自己的实践中得出的结论是：活学活用毛主席著作，切实在“用”字上狠下功夫，是实现革命化、做自觉的革命者的根本保证。邮递员土登在发言时用自己亲身的体会说：“我原来对有些藏文信投递不及时，后来在学习毛主席著作以后，认识到应该全心全意为人民服务，而我自己还没有全心全意为人民服务。自己明确了这一点以后，想到过去西藏劳动人民根本没有寄信的权利，今天他们有了这种权利，又有了写信的能力，我能为他们送信，这不正是毛泽东思想在西藏的胜利吗？想通了以后，我就怀着强烈的阶级感情来对待每一封藏文信件，想方设法迅速地把每一封信都安全地送到收信人手里。”
    到会的同志广泛交换了学习毛主席著作的经验和心得，互相学习，共同提高。他们说，这次座谈会本身就是一个革命化的会议，就是一次活学活用毛主席著作的会议。许多人在会上联系毛主席的教导，联系王杰同志一心为革命，一不怕苦，二不怕死的伟大精神，对照检查了自己的思想和行动，找差距，明方向，下决心要使自己不断革命，永远革命，立志做一个真正的自觉革命者，为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己最大的力量。
