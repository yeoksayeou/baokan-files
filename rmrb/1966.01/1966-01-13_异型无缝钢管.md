    Shaped Seamless Steel Tubes
    Ordinary seamless steel tubes are circular, while shaped seamless steel tubes have special shapes, such as square, rectangular, rhomboid, triangular, polygonal, elliptical, crescent-shaped, pagoda-shaped, plum blossom-shaped, and so on. The production process of shaped seamless steel tubes involves processing steel materials into seamless steel tubes, and then further processing them using methods such as drawing and extrusion. Due to their relatively special shapes, their production technology is much more complex than that of ordinary seamless steel tubes. In foreign countries, they generally require more sophisticated and modern equipment to produce. These special-shaped seamless steel tubes have special properties such as resistance to high temperatures, high pressures, and wear resistance, which ordinary seamless steel tubes do not possess.
    Shaped seamless steel tubes have a wide range of applications. Many important components and parts of advanced instruments, precision equipment, tractors, combine harvesters, nitrogen fertilizer equipment, airplanes, boilers, etc., must be manufactured using shaped seamless steel tubes. For example, the advanced production method for watch cases should use shaped seamless steel tubes. In the past, when China could not produce shaped seamless steel tubes, it had to stamp and process stainless steel plates one case at a time, which was not only inefficient and of poor quality but also consumed a large amount of metal, thus increasing the cost of watches. Now, with shaped seamless steel tubes that have the same cross-section as watch cases, all that is needed is to cut the shaped seamless steel tubes into individual cases according to size, which greatly simplifies the processing technology of watch cases, greatly improves work efficiency, and also improves the quality of the cases. Currently, the Shanghai brand watch cases produced in China are made using corresponding shaped seamless steel tubes. The middle and rear beams of combine harvesters used to be made of solid square steel, making the machine body relatively heavy, the operating efficiency relatively low, and the consumption of steel relatively high. Now, using square and rectangular shaped seamless steel tubes to make the same beams can reduce the weight of the combine harvester, improve work efficiency, and also save metal materials. There are also some parts and components inside some machines that must be manufactured using shaped seamless steel tubes and cannot be replaced.
    In the past, China could not produce shaped seamless steel tubes and could only rely on imports, while imperialists and revisionists made things difficult for us with shaped seamless steel tubes.
    Now, China is already able to produce hundreds of shaped seamless steel tubes of different shapes and specifications.

    异型无缝钢管
    普通无缝钢管是圆形的，异型无缝钢管是特殊形状的，如方形、矩形、菱形、三角形、多边形、椭圆形、月牙形、宝塔形、梅花形等等。异型无缝钢管的生产过程，是把钢料加工成无缝钢管后，采用拔制、挤压等方法进行再加工。由于形状比较特殊，所以它的生产技术比普通无缝钢管复杂得多。在国外，一般都要用较精密较现代化的设备才能生产。这种特殊形状的无缝钢管比普通无缝钢管具有耐高温、耐高压、耐磨擦等等特殊性能。
    异型无缝钢管的用途很广。高级仪器、精密设备、拖拉机、联合收割机、氮肥设备、飞机、锅炉等不少重要的部件和零件，都要用异型无缝钢管制造。比如，手表表壳的先进生产方法，应该用异型无缝钢管制造。我国过去不能生产异型无缝钢管的时候，只好用不锈钢板一个表壳一个表壳地冲制加工，不仅效率低，质量差，而且金属消耗量大，因此手表的成本也高。现在有了断面与手表表壳一样的异型无缝钢管，只要按尺寸把异型无缝钢管切成一个个表壳就行了，这就大大简化了手表表壳的加工工艺，大大提高了工效，表壳的质量也更好了。目前我国生产的上海牌手表表壳就是用相应的异型无缝钢管制造的。联合收割机的中间和后边的大梁，过去用实心方钢制作，机体比较笨重，作业效率比较低，耗用的钢材也比较多。现用方形和矩形的异型无缝钢管做同样的大梁，可以减轻联合收割机的重量，提高工作效率，同时还能节省金属材料。还有一些机械里边的某些零件和部件必须用异型无缝钢管制造，无法代替。
    过去我国不能生产异型无缝钢管，只能依靠进口，而帝国主义和修正主义者则在异型无缝钢管上刁难我们。
    现在，我国已经能生产几百个形状、规格不同的异型无缝钢管了。
