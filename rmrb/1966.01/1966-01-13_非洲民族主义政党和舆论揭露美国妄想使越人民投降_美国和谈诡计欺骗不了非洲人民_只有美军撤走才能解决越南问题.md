    According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, December 12th: Pasipanodya, Chief Representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union, stated here on the 12th that the Johnson government constantly says that U.S. imperialism is willing to achieve peace in Vietnam through "unconditional negotiations," but the world will not be deceived by such despicable talk.
    The statement demanded that U.S. imperialism withdraw its troops from South Vietnam.
    Sam Nujoma, Chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization, recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters here: SWAPO has always advocated "the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to solve their own affairs."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 11th: Chaki, Acting Representative of the Basutoland Congress Party in Cairo, issued a statement on the 11th, saying: "There is nothing new in the fourteen-point plan for 'peace talks' proposed by Johnson regarding the (Vietnam issue). This new offensive is no different from the previous ones. It is merely a continuation of the old methods adopted on a global scale to deceive the world."
    The statement pointed out: "All the dirty tricks of the United States cannot deceive the progressive world, especially the people of the countries struggling in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These tricks are doomed to failure."
    Sechele, Representative of the Bechuanaland People's Party Office in Cairo, issued a statement on the 11th, saying: "The fourteen proposals on Vietnam put forward by U.S. imperialism are unacceptable."
    The statement asked, how can the U.S. aggressors expect the oppressed Vietnamese people to fold their hands without retaliating with resolute struggle—an eye for an eye, a blow for a blow, and a bullet for a bullet?
    The African National Congress of South Africa Office in Cairo issued a statement saying: The U.S. imperialists' "peace offensive" is obviously intended to deceive world public opinion. "The U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam remains unchanged."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zanzibar, January 10th: The Zanzibar News Agency published an editorial on the 10th, pointing out that although Johnson's "peace offensive" has been supported by a group of "peace" peddlers such as British imperialism and modern revisionism, it will be thoroughly exposed and shattered, just like other "peace" scams in the past.
    The editorial said, "In the language of U.S. imperialism, the word peace always has the inherent meaning of aggression and domination." The editorial then pointed out that what has happened in South Vietnam, Congo (L), and the Dominican Republic at least shows that when U.S. imperialism promotes "peace," it actually means carrying out naked aggression.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, January 11th: The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Sahafa* published an article on the 11th, emphasizing that it is necessary to "expose the deceptive plan of the U.S. government's so-called peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue."
    The article, referring to U.S. Vice President Humphrey's recent statement in Tokyo that the United States "cannot leave Vietnam" before achieving its so-called "peace," pointed out, "This means that the United States wants the heroic Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and accept the unfair solutions imposed on them by the United States."
    The article emphasized that the only way out for the United States is to withdraw all its troops from South Vietnam and recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the legitimate political representative of South Vietnam.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 10th: Ahmed Ibrahim, Representative of the Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa in Cairo, issued a statement here on the 10th, saying: "The so-called diplomatic offensive for peace is not aimed at restoring peace in Vietnam, but at allowing the U.S. aggressors to redeploy in order to further invade Indochina."
    The statement pointed out that the "Johnson government" is playing "peace" tricks "to win at the conference table what it has already lost on the battlefield."
    The statement pointed out that while Washington is sending out high-ranking "peace envoys," it is busy preparing to expand the Indochina war.
    The statement emphasized: "The Vietnam issue can only be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves. If the United States is truly sincere about calling for peace, the first step must be the unconditional and complete withdrawal of U.S. troops."

    非洲民族主义政党和舆论揭露美国妄想使越人民投降
    美国和谈诡计欺骗不了非洲人民  只有美军撤走才能解决越南问题
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆十二日电　津巴布韦非洲民族联盟的首席代表帕西帕诺迪亚十二日在这里发表声明说，约翰逊政府不断地说，美帝国主义愿意通过“无条件谈判”实现越南的和平，但是世界是不会被这种卑鄙的言谈所蒙蔽的。
    声明要求美帝国主义把它的军队从南越撤出去。
    西南非洲人民组织主席萨姆·努乔姆最近在这里接见新华社记者时说：西南非洲人民组织一向主张“美军全部撤出越南，让越南人民解决他们自己的事情”。
    据新华社开罗十一日电　巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代理代表恰齐十一日发表声明说：“约翰逊提出的关于（越南问题）‘和谈’的十四点计划中没有新东西。这个新的攻势同以前的没有什么差别。它只是为了欺骗世界而在世界范围内所采取的老办法的继续。”
    声明指出：“美国的一切肮脏阴谋都欺骗不了进步的世界，特别是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲斗争中的各国人民，这些阴谋是注定要失败的。”
    贝专纳人民党驻开罗办事处代表塞切尔十一日发表声明说：“美帝国主义提出的关于越南的十四点建议，是不能接受的。”
    声明问道，美国侵略者怎么能够指望受压迫的越南人民缩起双手，而不采取针锋相对，以眼还眼，以打击还打击，以枪弹还枪弹的坚决斗争来进行反击呢？
    南非非洲人国民大会驻开罗办事处发表声明说：美帝国主义者的“和平攻势”显然是想欺骗世界公众。“美国在越南的侵略政策仍然没有改变。”
    据新华社桑给巴尔十日电桑给巴尔通讯社十日发表社论指出，约翰逊的“和平攻势”尽管得到英帝国主义和现代修正主义等一群“和平”贩子的支持，但是，象过去其他“和平”骗局一样，会被彻底揭露和粉碎。
    社论说，“在美帝国主义的语言里，和平这个词始终具有侵略和统治的固有含义。”社论接着指出，在南越、刚果（利）和多米尼加所发生的事情至少表明，美帝国主义在宣传“和平”的时候，实际上意味着要进行赤裸裸的侵略。
    据新华社喀土穆十一日电苏丹《新闻日报》十一日发表文章，强调必须“揭露美国政府所谓寻求越南问题的和平解决的骗人计划”。
    文章在谈到美国副总统汉弗莱最近在东京表示美国在实现它所谓的“和平”以前，“不能够离开越南”这件事时指出，
  “这就是说，美国要英雄的越南人民放下武器，接受美国强加于他们的不公平的解决办法”。
    文章强调指出，美国的唯一出路是，把它的军队全部撤出南越，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方合法的政治代表。
    据新华社开罗十日电　南非泛非主义者大会驻开罗代表艾哈迈德·易卜拉欣十日在这里发表声明说：“所谓争取和平的外交攻势，目的不是要恢复越南的和平，而是要让美国侵略者重新部署，以便进一步侵略印度支那。”
    声明指出，“约翰逊政府”玩弄“和平”骗局，“是想要在会议桌上赢得它在战场上已经输掉的东西。”
    声明指出，华盛顿在派出高级“和平使者”的同时，正在忙于准备扩大印度支那战争。
    声明强调说：“越南问题只能由越南人民自己来解决。如果美国叫嚷和平真有诚意的话，第一步必须是美军无条件地完全撤走。”
