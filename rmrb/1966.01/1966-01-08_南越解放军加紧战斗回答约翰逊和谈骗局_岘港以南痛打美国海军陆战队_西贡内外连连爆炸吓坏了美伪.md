    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 7th: Reports from Saigon: The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces ambushed a unit of U.S. Marines in the Vu Gia River Valley south of Da Nang on the 6th, beating the enemy so badly that they fled into the rice paddies, afraid to show their faces.

    According to a report by United Press International, on the afternoon of the 6th, as a unit of U.S. Marines on a "mopping-up" operation was crossing a rice paddy, the Liberation Army, ambushed on the right side of the paddy, suddenly opened fire on them. Some American soldiers were immediately killed or wounded. Those who were not killed were terrified and "plunked" into the rice paddy, blindly diving into the waist-deep water to escape the Liberation Army's fire. "These Marines were trapped in the rice paddy for more than five hours." Another unit of American troops that came to rescue them also suffered losses. The report revealed that the firepower in this area was fierce, and U.S. helicopters did not dare to land and evacuate the wounded until after 10 p.m.

    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 7th: Reports from Saigon: On the evening of the 6th, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces successively attacked the U.S. aggressor troops and puppet police at the main gate of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport and in Saigon's city center. According to preliminary reports from Western news agencies, at least five U.S. aggressors were wounded in the explosion near the main gate of Tan Son Nhut Airport.

    According to reports, in the early evening of the 6th, a bomb planted by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces exploded near the main gate of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport. At the time, a large number of U.S. aggressor troops were crowded there waiting for vehicles to go to Saigon. The Saigon puppet police said, "The person who planted the bomb has not been caught."

    Less than an hour after the explosion at Tan Son Nhut Airport, the People's Armed Forces attacked a puppet police station in the eastern part of Saigon. The building of the police station was damaged by the explosion, and one puppet policeman was killed.

    The message said that from the beginning of the New Year to the 6th, there have been three explosions in Saigon. The recent series of explosions has greatly frightened the American puppet clique. The Associated Press said that the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces are "now swaggering into Saigon" as "easily as walking into the next room."

    南越解放军加紧战斗回答约翰逊和谈骗局
    岘港以南痛打美国海军陆战队　西贡内外连连爆炸吓坏了美伪
    新华社七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民武装六日在岘港以南的武嘉河谷伏击了一支美国海军陆战队，打得敌人逃到水稻田里不敢露头。
    据合众国际社报道，六日下午当一支前往“扫荡”的美国海军陆战队正穿过一片稻田时，埋伏在稻田右侧的解放军突然向他们开火，当即有一些美军被打死打伤，那些没有被打死的美军惊慌万分，纷纷“扑通一声跳下稻田”，没头没脑地往齐腰深的水里钻，逃避解放军的火力。“这些海军陆战队在稻田里被困达五小时以上”。另一支前来救援的美军也遭到损失。报道透露，这个地区的火力猛烈，美军直升飞机迟至晚上十点多钟才敢降落运走伤兵。
    新华社七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民武装六日晚在西贡新山一机场大门口和西贡市区先后袭击美国侵略军和伪警察。据西方通讯社初步透露，在新山一机场大门口附近至少有五名美国侵略者被炸伤。
    据报道，六日傍晚，南越人民武装在西贡新山一机场大门口附近放置的一颗炸弹爆炸了。当时，正有大批美国侵略军挤在那里等候开往西贡的车辆。西贡伪警方说，“没有抓到放置炸弹的人”。
    在新山一机场发生爆炸后不到一小时，人民武装又袭击了西贡东城的一个伪警察派出所。这个派出所的建筑物被炸坏，一名伪警察被炸死。
    消息说，从新年开始到六日为止，西贡已经发生了三次爆炸事件。最近以来的一连串爆炸使美伪集团十分惊慌。美联社说，南越人民武装“现在是大摇大摆地走进西贡”，“就象走进隔壁房间去一样容易”。
