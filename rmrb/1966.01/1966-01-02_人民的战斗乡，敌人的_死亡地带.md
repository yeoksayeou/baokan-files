    The People's Fighting Township, the Enemy's "Death Zone"
    For six years, the people of Xingfu Township have repelled thirteen enemy "sweeps" and overcome one round after another of frenzied bombing by American planes, becoming an indestructible and unbombable steel fortress in the South Vietnamese people's war.

    Xingfu Township in Tây Ninh Province was liberated in 1960. From the day of liberation, the people here organized themselves, took up guns, and actively defended their homeland.

    The US-puppet clique was unwilling to accept defeat. In recent years, they have launched thirteen large and small "sweeps" against this fighting township, but each time they were beaten back in disarray. The guerrilla forces of Xingfu Township have been tempered and grown in battle. On the one hand, they seize enemy weapons to equip themselves, and on the other hand, they learn from the experiences of other regions and establish their own small arsenal, using their own produced guns and grenades to equip the constantly developing and growing guerrilla forces. The entire township, men, women, old and young, are mobilized. In areas where the enemy may invade, they have dug countless traps, stake pits, crisscrossing trenches, and combat bunkers scattered throughout the area. They have also built many combat fences in some strategic locations, making every inch of land in this fighting village a "death zone" for the enemy.

    Once, the US-puppet clique dispatched two regiments of troops, under the cover of twenty-seven aircraft, to launch a frenzied attack on Xingfu Township. Before the attack, they used cars to publicize extensively in Tây Ninh city, the provincial capital, boasting that they would completely "pacify" Xingfu Township within seven days. However, on the very first day, as they just stuck their noses into Xingfu Township, the Xingfu Township guerrillas, in coordination with the nearby Háodức Township guerrillas, immediately used landmines, rifles, and grenades to heroically intercept the enemy, killing and wounding more than 150 enemy soldiers. That night, the guerrillas appeared and disappeared mysteriously, attacking the enemy everywhere in the township, scaring them out of their wits. They had to change locations three times in one night. Barely managing to make it to the next day, they set fire to the people's houses and fled in panic back to Tây Ninh city. On the streets of Tây Ninh city, the propaganda vehicles, which had been very arrogant the day before, were now used to inform the families of the puppet soldiers to identify the corpses of their relatives. The enemy's repeated land invasions had failed, and they had no choice but to beg for "air superiority," using planes to carry out indiscriminate bombing and strafing. Sometimes, in a single day, they dropped four tons of bombs on this township. However, the people of Xingfu Township responded to the enemy by saying: We will not only fight, but also produce more grain for the revolution!

    Therefore, the guerrilla forces established an aircraft hunting team. Not only did every household in the township dig air-raid shelters, but air-raid shelters were also dug in the fields and on the ridges. At the end of July this year, just as the farmers of the entire township were transplanting rice seedlings in the fields, suddenly a batch of enemy planes came screaming. The guerrilla forces used intensive firepower to fiercely strike the bandit planes. A helicopter was wounded and staggered away. Then another jet fighter was hit, and a deafening explosion was heard. This American bandit plane crashed on the grass of a village and was smashed to pieces. The enemy fled, the sky returned to calm, and the farmers were busy in the fields again. In this way, the soldiers and civilians of Xingfu Township have already used light weapons to shoot down and wound three enemy aircraft each.

    The people of Xingfu Township are full of revolutionary optimism in the struggle against the enemy and in building a new life, and are increasingly demonstrating that their tremendous power is invincible.

### 人民的战斗乡，敌人的“死亡地带”

    颂英雄的人民　赞人民的英雄
    人民的战斗乡，敌人的“死亡地带”
    六年来，幸福乡人民打退了敌人十三次“扫荡”，战胜了美机一次又一次的狂轰滥炸，在南越人民战争中成了攻不破、炸不烂的钢铁堡垒。
    西宁省的幸福乡，是一九六○年解放的。从解放那天起，这里的人民就组织起来，手拿枪杆，积极保卫自己的家乡。
    美伪集团不死心，几年来，它们对这个战斗乡进行了十三次大小“扫荡”，但是每一次都被打得狼狈逃窜。幸福乡的游击队在战斗中得到了锻炼成长，他们一方面夺取敌人的武器来装备自己，另一方面学习其他地区的经验，自己建立了一个小兵工厂，用自己生产的枪和手榴弹来装备不断发展和壮大的游击队。全乡男女老幼齐动员，在敌人可能进犯的地方，挖了无数陷阱、桩板坑、纵横交错的战壕和密布各地的战斗掩体，并且在一些要冲的地方围筑了许多战斗篱笆，使这个战斗的乡村的每一寸土地都成为敌人的“死亡地带”。
    有一次，美伪集团派遣了两个团的军队，在二十七架飞机的掩护下，向幸福乡发动疯狂的进攻。进攻前，它们用汽车在省会西宁市内大肆宣传，吹嘘将在七天内完全“绥靖”幸福乡。但是，就在头一天，当它们把鼻子刚刚伸进幸福乡的时候，幸福乡游击队配合附近的豪德乡游击队，立刻用地雷、步枪、手榴弹，英勇地截击敌人，打死打伤敌军一百五十多名。当天晚上，游击队又神出鬼没地在全乡到处袭击敌人，把敌人打得丧魂落魄，在一夜中要换三次地点，好容易挨到第二天天亮，他们放火焚烧了人民的房子，仓惶逃回西宁市。在西宁市的街道上，前一天还十分嚣张的宣传车，现在却用来通知伪军家属去认他们的亲人的尸体。敌人从陆路一次又一次的进犯失败了，它们只好乞灵于“空中优势”，用飞机进行狂轰滥炸和扫射，有时在一天内，他们就对这个乡投下四吨炸弹。但是，幸福乡人民对敌人的回答是：我们不仅要战斗，而且要为革命生产出更多的粮食！
    于是，游击队成立了猎机组，全乡不仅每户人家都挖了防空洞，而且在田头、田埂上也挖了防空洞。今年七月底，正当全乡农民在地里插秧的时候，突然一批敌机窜来，游击队用密集的火力痛击强盗飞机，一架直升飞机受伤，摇摇晃晃地逃跑了，接着另一架喷气式战斗机中弹，只听见一声震天巨响，这架美国强盗飞机坠落到一个村庄的草地上，粉身碎骨。敌人逃窜了，天空又恢复了安静，农民们又在田野上忙碌起来。就这样，幸福乡的军民已经用轻武器击落、击伤敌机各三架。
    幸福乡人民在抗击敌人和建设新生活的战斗中，充满着革命乐观主义精神，愈来愈表明他们的巨大力量是不可战胜的。
