    "Talk First, Retreat Later" Means Only Talk, No Retreat
    By Our Commentator
    On the Vietnam issue, the Johnson administration is now spreading a "talk first, retreat later" argument. The gist is that the United States has made a guarantee that as long as talks begin first, it can withdraw its troops. The "Fourteen Points" proposal, which claims that the United States "does not wish to keep American troops in South Vietnam after peace is secured," means just that.
    The "talk first, retreat later" argument is based on the premise that neither side can win on the South Vietnamese battlefield. Johnson has said more than once that "neither side sees a purely military solution." After the "Fourteen Points" proposal came out, American newspapers also repeatedly promoted the idea that "neither side has won or lost this war." They indirectly expressed that the Vietnam War will always have to be ended through negotiations, and now is the time to sit down at the negotiating table.
    Indeed, any war will eventually come to an end. The Hundred Years' War in history stopped in its 101st year. The just war of national liberation against aggression can end in two ways: one is that the aggressors are completely annihilated or driven out completely. This eliminates the need for negotiations. The other is that the aggressors are defeated miserably and admit defeat. This may require negotiations to determine the situation and resolve the problem.
    The French colonialists' war of aggression against Indochina ended through negotiations. Why did such an outcome occur? The Vietnamese and Indochinese people persisted in a long-term armed struggle, especially the Dien Bien Phu campaign, which shook Paris and caused the Bidault government to fall. The French ruling group had to come to the conclusion that rather than be completely wiped out, and thus cause an uncontrollable domestic political situation, it would be better to be forced to withdraw. The 1954 Geneva Accords were signed under these conditions.
    The American aggressors have actually lost on the South Vietnamese battlefield, but stubbornly refuse to admit defeat. The Johnson administration is still transferring troops to South Vietnam, preparing for an even greater contest. Even Harriman, who has repeatedly professed America's "sincere desire for peace," said unequivocally in Tokyo on January 7 that the United States "will never retreat from Vietnam." American imperialism is the most barbaric, vicious, and shameless aggressor in the world. It is inconceivable that peace can be achieved in Vietnam and Indochina without completely defeating it.
    Moreover, the situation in Vietnam today is fundamentally different from the situation in Indochina in 1954. At that time, there was no international agreement, so it was necessary to hold a meeting first. Today, there is already a Geneva Accord, and the US government has undertaken obligations. If the United States had the slightest sincerity in respecting the Geneva Accords, there would be no need to hold meetings and negotiate at all; it would only need to withdraw all its armed forces in accordance with this agreement. Otherwise, what use would it be to hold another meeting, two meetings, or even a hundred meetings, and sign an agreement, two agreements, or even a hundred agreements?
    So, what exactly is the "talk first, retreat later" theory? To put it bluntly, it is to tie up the hands and feet of the Vietnamese people with the tactic of "peace talks," while postponing the American withdrawal to an indefinite future. It waves the banner of "unconditional discussions," while selling the so-called conditional withdrawal. What are the conditions? That is: the people of South Vietnam must lay down their arms and stop resisting, and the people of North Vietnam must stop supporting their southern compatriots. This insulting condition of the American aggressors is, of course, unacceptable to the Vietnamese people. Therefore, the Johnson administration will repeat its past excuses and will never withdraw the American aggressor troops. It is clear that the so-called "talk first, retreat later" is essentially just talk, no retreat. In Johnson's words, it is that the United States "will not retreat, either openly or under the guise of a meaningless agreement."
    The Johnson administration, together with its partners and helpers, is loudly promoting the "talk first, retreat later" theory, with extremely malicious intentions. As everyone knows, many peace-loving countries in Asia and Africa hope that the Vietnam issue can be resolved reasonably and fairly, and that peace in the Indochina region can be restored as soon as possible. The Johnson administration is precisely attempting to use this good intention to create public opinion and put pressure on the Vietnamese people, in an effort to peddle the "Fourteen Points" proposal and thereby realize the conspiracy of the United States to permanently occupy South Vietnam. People cannot but be vigilant about this sinister scheme of the Johnson administration.
    Since the American aggressors are determined to stay in South Vietnam and not withdraw, then the Vietnamese people have no other choice but to fight to the end and drive out the aggressors. As the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front pointed out in its statement of January 5: "As long as US imperialism has not stopped its aggression, has not withdrawn all the troops and weapons of the United States and its puppets from South Vietnam, has not completely withdrawn its military bases in South Vietnam, has not recognized the national rights of the people of South Vietnam: independence, peace, democracy, neutrality and unification of the fatherland, and has not allowed the people of South Vietnam to solve their own internal affairs, the fourteen million people of South Vietnam will still hold their guns tightly in their hands and resolutely fight, even if it takes ten years, twenty years, or even longer, enduring greater hardships and sacrifices." The Vietnamese people's firm determination to resist America and save the country is a head-on blow to the Johnson administration's "talk first, retreat later" theory.

### “先谈后撤”就是只谈不撤

    “先谈后撤”就是只谈不撤
    本报评论员
    在越南问题上，约翰逊政府现在散布一种“先谈后撤”的论调。大意是说：美国已经作出保证，只要先谈起来，它是可以撤军的。“十四点”主张，说什么美国“并不希望在和平得到确保以后把美国军队继续留在南越”，就是这个意思。
    “先谈后撤”的论调，是基于这样一种前提：在南越战场上，双方都打不赢。约翰逊就不止一次地说过：“双方都看不出有纯军事的解决办法”。“十四点”主张出笼后，美国报刊也一再宣传，“任何一方都没有打赢或输掉这场战争”。他们转弯抹角地表示：越南战争总是要通过谈判来结束的，现在是坐到谈判桌上的时候了。
    诚然，任何战争，总有结束的一天。历史上的百年战争，到了第一百零一年就停止了。被压迫民族的反侵略的正义战争，可以有两种方式结束：一种是，侵略者被彻底歼灭，或者被全部赶走。这就根本不存在谈判的问题。另一种是，侵略者被打得一败涂地，低头认输。这就有可能需要通过谈判来确定情况，解决问题。
    法国殖民者侵略印度支那的战争，是通过谈判结束的。为什么会出现这样一种结局呢？越南人民和印度支那人民坚持了长期的武装斗争，特别是奠边府一役，震撼了巴黎，使皮杜尔政府为此倒台。法国统治集团不得不作出这样的结论：与其全军覆灭，并由此而引起国内政局不可收拾，还不如被迫撤走。一九五四年的日内瓦协议，就是在这种条件下签订的。
    美国侵略者在南越战场上实际上是打输了，但却死不肯认输。约翰逊政府还在调兵遣将，开往南越，准备作一次更大的较量。就是那个一再表白美国有“和平诚意”的哈里曼，一月七日在东京毫不含糊地说，美国“决不从越南后退”。美帝国主义是世界上最野蛮、最凶恶和最无耻的侵略者。不能设想，不把它彻底打败，就能在越南和印度支那实现和平。
    何况，今天越南的情况同一九五四年的印度支那的情况根本不同。那时，还没有一个国际协议，因此需要先开会。今天，已经有了一个日内瓦协议，而且美国政府是承担了义务的。如果美国有尊重日内瓦协议的起码的诚意，根本不需要开会谈判，只要按照这个协议把它的全部武装撤走就行了。否则，再开一次会、两次会、甚至一百次会，再签订一个协议、两个协议、甚至一百个协议，又有什么用呢？
    那么，“先谈后撤”论到底是什么东西呢？说穿了，就是用“和谈”的手法把越南人民的手脚捆绑起来，而把美国的撤军推迟到无限期的将来。打的是“无条件讨论”的幌子，卖的是所谓有条件撤军的货色。什么条件呢？这就是：越南南方人民必须放下武器、停止抵抗，越南北方人民必须停止对南方同胞的支援。美国侵略者的这个侮辱性的条件，当然是越南人民所不能接受的。因此，约翰逊政府也将重复它过去的种种借口，决不会把美国侵略军撤走。很清楚，所谓“先谈后撤”，实质上就是只谈不撤。用约翰逊的话来说，就是：美国“决不会撤退，无论是公开撤退，还是在一个没有意义的协议的掩饰下撤退”。
    约翰逊政府和它的合伙者和帮手们一起，高唱“先谈后撤”论，用心是十分恶毒的。大家知道，亚非地区许多爱好和平的国家，希望越南问题得到合理和公正的解决，早日恢复印度支那地区的和平。约翰逊政府正是企图利用这种善良的愿望，形成舆论，对越南人民造成压力，力图把“十四点”主张兜售出去，从而实现美国永远霸占南越的阴谋。对于约翰逊政府的这种罪恶图谋，不能不引起人们的警惕。
    美国侵略者既然硬要赖在南越不撤，那么，越南人民就没有别的选择，只有战斗到底，把侵略者打出去。正如越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一月五日发表的声明所指出的：“只要美帝国主义还没有停止侵略，没有从越南南方撤出美国及其仆从的全部军队和武器，没有全部撤销它们在越南南方的军事基地，没有承认越南南方人民的民族权利：独立、和平、民主、中立和统一祖国，没有让越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务，一千四百万越南南方人民就还要紧握手中枪，坚决战斗，那怕要战斗十年、二十年或者更长的时间，忍受更大的艰苦和牺牲。”越南人民这种抗美救国的坚强决心，是对约翰逊政府“先谈后撤”论的当头一棒。
