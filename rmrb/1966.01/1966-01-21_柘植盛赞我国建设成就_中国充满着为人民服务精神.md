    This newspaper reports that Tsuge Kijiro, leader of the Second Japan Beijing Radio Listeners Delegation and Standing Director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, who returned to Japan after visiting China, recently gave a report to enthusiasts of the Japanese-language broadcast of Beijing Radio about his visit to China.

    In his report, Tsuge said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have made outstanding achievements in socialist construction. Prices in China are low and have been stable for more than a decade, and the people live and work in peace and contentment. He said that the most profound impression he gained from this visit was that socialist China is filled everywhere with a spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people.

    Tsuge concluded by saying that this visit to China made us feel even more deeply the preciousness of the militant friendship between the people of Japan and China. Our two peoples are uniting to fight against U.S. imperialism and contribute to the cause of defending Asian peace.

    柘植盛赞我国建设成就
    中国充满着为人民服务精神
    本报讯  访问中国后回国的日本第二次北京广播收听者代表团团长、日中友好协会常任理事柘植?次郎不久前向北京电台日语广播的爱好者们作了关于访问中国的报告。
    柘植在报告中说，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设方面取得了出色的成就。中国的物价便宜，而且十几年来一直是稳定的，人民安居乐业。他说，这次访问印象最深的是，在社会主义中国到处都充满着一种完全为人民服务的精神。
    柘植最后说，这次访问中国，使我们更深切地感到日中两国人民的战斗友谊的可贵。我们两国人民正在团结起来，同美帝国主义作斗争，为保卫亚洲和平事业作出贡献。
