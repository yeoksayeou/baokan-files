    Comrade Lü Jian's Letter: My New Understanding
    After my article "The Crux of the Matter is Not Here" was published, it caused debate in our organization, and also triggered ideological struggle in my own thinking. As a result, I further studied Chairman Mao's relevant discourses. Now it seems that my original view was not objective. I only saw the superficial phenomena without seeing the essence of the problem through the superficial phenomena. Everything in the world is constantly changing, and people's thinking is also constantly changing. Today's ideological problems are solved, and tomorrow, under new conditions, new ideological problems will arise again. Therefore, ideological revolution cannot be ignored for a moment.
    People's thinking directs people's actions. Without revolutionary thinking, there can be no revolutionary actions. If the question of "serving whom" is not resolved, the question of "how to serve" cannot be discussed. Of course, the question of method is not unimportant. Chairman Mao said: "Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. It is empty talk to cross the river without solving the problem of the bridge or the boat." However, if you have no intention of crossing the river at all, how can you talk about the problem of a bridge or a boat? If your thinking is not revolutionized, how can you talk about the revolutionization of work? Therefore, without the revolution of thought, there is no revolution of methods.

    吕健同志来信：我的新认识
    我写的《症结不在这儿》一文发表以后，在我们机关里引起了争论，我思想上也引起了斗争。因此，我进一步学习了毛主席的有关论述。现在看来，我原来的看法是不客观的。我只看到了表面现象，而没有透过表面现象去看问题的实质。世界上万事万物无时无刻不在变化着，人的思想也无时无刻不在变化着。今天的思想问题解决了，明天在新的条件下，新的思想问题又会产生。所以思想革命是一时一刻不能忽视的。
    人的思想支配人的行动，没有革命的思想，就不可能有革命的行动。“为谁服务”的问题不解决，“怎样服务”的问题就无从谈起。当然，方法问题也并不是无关紧要的。毛主席说过：“我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。”然而，如果你根本就没有过河的打算，又怎能谈得上什么桥或船的问题呢？如果你思想没有革命化，又怎能谈上工作革命化呢？所以没有思想的革命，就没有方法的革命。
