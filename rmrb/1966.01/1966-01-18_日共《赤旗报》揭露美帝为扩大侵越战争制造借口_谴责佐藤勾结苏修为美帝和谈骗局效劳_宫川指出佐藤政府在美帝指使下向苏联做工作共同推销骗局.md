    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 17th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper *Red Flag* published an editorial on the 16th titled "Smash the Deceptive Nature of the 'Peace Offensive,' Further Strengthen Solidarity with the Vietnamese People," pointing out that the US imperialists' so-called "Fourteen Points" proposal is an attempt to create excuses for further expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The editorial condemned the Sato government for acting as US imperialism's pawn, colluding with Soviet modern revisionists to serve the United States' "peace talk" swindle.

    The editorial said that in its "peace offensive," US imperialism successively dispatched US Vice President Humphrey and US Presidential Envoy Harriman to visit Japan. In the two meetings between Humphrey and Sato, and Harriman and Sato, they discussed how the Japanese government could cooperate with the United States' "peace offensive." They also discussed the Japanese government's plan to participate in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and reached certain agreements. This has now become an open secret. More importantly, US imperialism has also proposed to the Sato Cabinet that it collude with Soviet modern revisionists to serve its "peace talk" swindle. Therefore, the day after Harriman returned home, Sato hurriedly summoned Soviet Ambassador to Japan Vinogradov, requesting that "the Soviet Union exert influence on North Vietnam," and had Foreign Minister Shiina, who was leaving for the Soviet Union on the 15th, carry Sato's personal letter to hold talks with Soviet government leaders.

    The editorial pointed out that if Sato believes that cooperating with the international trend of modern revisionism can exert pressure on the Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, that can only be said to be too naive. As for the Sato Cabinet's attempt to deceive the Japanese people and prevent them from seeing that the Sato Cabinet is following US imperialism in pursuing policies of aggression and war, that is also impossible.

    The editorial concluded by calling on all democratic forces in Japan to smash US imperialism's deceptive "peace offensive," strengthen solidarity actions in support of the Vietnamese people, and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression.

    Hakmada Satomi, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said at the New Year's meeting held at the Mitaka City Municipal Hall on the 11th that the United States' recent "peace offensive" is a shameless swindle. Hakmada Satomi pointed out that the US government is sending officials to Japan and other countries to peddle its so-called peaceful solution to the Vietnam problem and promote its peaceful posture.

    However, US imperialism is constantly and desperately increasing its troops in South Vietnam in order to expand its war of aggression.

    Hakmada Satomi said: "US imperialism is already on the verge of defeat in Vietnam. It is not US imperialism that determines the development of the situation. If the people of the world, especially the people of Japan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Korea, and China, unite and fight resolutely, they will be able to thwart US imperialism's attempts to expand the war and defeat its aggression."

    He also called for a resolute struggle against the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam and against the American and Japanese reactionaries' use of Japan as a base for launching wars of aggression.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Prominent Japanese art critic Miyakawa Torio pointed out that the "Fourteen Points" proposal put forward by the United States has nothing new at all and only exposes its desire to remain in South Vietnam.

    Miyakawa also condemned the Sato government for providing the United States with land, sea, and air force bases for aggression against Vietnam, while at the same time, under US instructions, participating in the US "peace offensive" by working on countries such as the Soviet Union.

    Miyakawa pointed out that the US-Japanese reactionaries are putting forward the so-called slogan of "giving peace to Vietnam" in Japan, attempting to rape the will of the broad masses of Japanese people who demand peace. He said that our slogan is "giving victory to the Vietnamese people." Only in this way can true peace be brought to Vietnam, which is the direction of the Japanese people's peace movement.

    日共《赤旗报》揭露美帝为扩大侵越战争制造借口
    谴责佐藤勾结苏修为美帝和谈骗局效劳
    宫川指出佐藤政府在美帝指使下向苏联做工作共同推销骗局
    据新华社东京十七日电  日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》十六日以《粉碎“和平攻势”的欺骗性，进一步加强同越南人民的团结》为题发表社论，指出美帝国主义提出所谓“十四点”主张，是企图为进一步扩大侵略越南的战争制造借口。
    社论谴责佐藤政府充当美帝国主义的马前卒，勾结苏联现代修正主义者为美国的“和谈”骗局服务。
    社论说，美帝国主义在它的“和平攻势”中，相继派出美国副总统汉弗莱和美国总统特使哈里曼访问日本。在汉弗莱—佐藤和哈里曼—佐藤的两次会谈中，讨论了日本政府怎样为美国的“和平攻势”合作，同时还讨论了日本政府参加扩大侵略越南战争的计划，而且达成了一定的协议，这些现在已经成为公开的秘密。更重要的是美帝国主义还对佐藤内阁提出，要它勾结苏联现代修正主义者来为它的“和谈”骗局服务。因此佐藤在哈里曼回国后的第二天，连忙召见苏联驻日本大使维诺格拉多夫，要求“苏联对北越施加影响”，并且让十五日前往苏联访问的椎名外交大臣带上佐藤的亲笔信，同苏联政府首脑进行会谈。
    社论指出，如果佐藤认为，同现代修正主义的国际思潮进行合作，就能向越南人民和越南民主共和国施加压力，那只能说是未免太浅见了。至于佐藤内阁的企图蒙蔽日本人民的眼睛，不让他们看见佐藤内阁追随美帝国主义推行侵略和战争政策，那也是办不到的。
    社论最后号召日本全体民主力量粉碎美帝国主义的骗人的“和平攻势”，加强支持越南人民的团结行动，支援越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    日共中央政治局委员袴田里见，十一日在三鹰市市政大厅举行的新年大会上说，美国最近的“和平攻势”是无耻的骗局。袴田里见指出，美国政府派出官员到日本等一些国家兜售它的所谓和平解决越南问题的办法，宣传它的和平姿态。
    但是，美帝国主义正在不断拼命增兵南越，以扩大它的侵略战争。
    袴田里见说：“美帝国主义在越南已经濒于失败。决定事态发展的不是美帝国主义。如果世界人民，特别是日本、越南、老挝、柬埔寨、朝鲜和中国人民联合起来坚决斗争，他们就能够挫败美帝国主义扩大战争的企图，击败它的侵略。”
    他还呼吁进行坚决斗争，反对美帝国主义的侵越战争，反对美国和日本反动派利用日本作为发动侵略战争的基地。
    据新华社东京电　日本著名美术评论家宫川寅雄指出，美国提出的“十四点”主张，根本没有什么新东西，只是暴露它想赖在南越不走。
    宫川还谴责佐藤政府一面为美国提供侵略越南的陆海空军基地，一面又在美国指使下，通过向苏联等国做工作，参与美国的“和平攻势”。
    宫川指出，美日反动派在日本国内提出所谓“给越南以和平”的口号，企图强奸广大日本人民要求和平的意志。他说，我们的口号是“给越南人民以胜利”。只有这样才能给越南带来真正的和平，这是日本人民保卫和平运动的方向。
