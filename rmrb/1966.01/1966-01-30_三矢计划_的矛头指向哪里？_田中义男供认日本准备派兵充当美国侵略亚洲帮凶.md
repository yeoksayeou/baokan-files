    Where Does the "Three Arrows Plan" Aim?
    Tanaka Yoshio Admits Japan Prepared to Send Troops as Accomplice to US Aggression in Asia
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo—Tanaka Yoshio, the chief planner of the "Three Arrows Operation Plan," which took China and Korea as hypothetical enemies, and former Lieutenant General of the Japan "Defense Agency" (equivalent to the Ministry of Defense) "Self-Defense Forces," admitted on the 18th that in a second Korean War instigated by the US-Japan reactionaries, the Japan "Self-Defense Forces" would participate in combat to support the "United Nations Forces," further exposing the Japanese militarists, fostered by US imperialism, who are attempting to send troops abroad and repeat the old path of aggression in Asia.
    According to a report in the *Akahata* newspaper on the 19th, Tanaka Yoshio appeared as a witness at the 28th public trial of the "Eniwa Incident" held at the Sapporo District Court in Hokkaido on the 18th. During his testimony, under persistent questioning from the defendant's lawyer, Naito Isao, Tanaka Yoshio evaded the issue, desperately defending the US aggressor troops and the Japan "Self-Defense Forces," and avoiding the essence of the problem. However, he admitted that Japan has already established a "Japan-US Joint Operations Coordination Office." In the "Three Arrows Operation Plan," it was envisioned that the "Self-Defense Forces" would conduct combat to support the "United Nations Forces," and that "in order to deal a decisive blow to the enemy, the combat operations should be expanded to areas outside Japanese territory; this is the most basic principle of tactics." The "Three Arrows Operation Plan" and the annual "Defense Plans" formulated by the Japan "Defense Agency" are based on this idea.
    Tanaka Yoshio also admitted that the Japan "Maritime Self-Defense Force" will cooperate with the US military to blockade the Tsushima Strait. To this end, Japan and the United States have conducted many exercises. Tanaka also confirmed that when US troops attack foreign bases, the Japan "Self-Defense Forces" assist the US military in reconnaissance and other activities.
    The *Akahata* pointed out that Tanaka Yoshio's testimony exposed the lie of the Japanese government authorities, who said that the "Three Arrows Operation Plan" was merely "idle talk on paper."
      The "Eniwa Incident" was created by the US-Japan reactionaries to suppress Japanese farmers who opposed the Japan "Self-Defense Forces." In December 1962, a farmer in Eniwa, Hokkaido, in order to protect his right to livelihood, cut off the communication lines within the exercise field of the Japan "Ground Self-Defense Force," which hindered their production and life. The Japan "Self-Defense Forces" falsely accused the farmer of violating the "Self-Defense Forces Law." The Japanese democratic forces launched a struggle against the authorities, pointing out that the existence of the Japan "Self-Defense Forces" itself violates the Japanese Constitution, and through the struggle, exposed its aggressive nature.

### “三矢计划”的矛头指向哪里？  田中义男供认日本准备派兵充当美国侵略亚洲帮凶

    “三矢计划”的矛头指向哪里？
    田中义男供认日本准备派兵充当美国侵略亚洲帮凶
    新华社东京电　以中国和朝鲜为假想敌人的“三矢作战计划”的总策划人、前日本“防卫厅”（相当于国防局）“自卫队”陆将（相当于中将）田中义男十八日供认，在美日反动派阴谋挑起的第二次朝鲜战争中，日本“自卫队”将参加作战以支援“联合国军”，从而进一步暴露了在美帝国主义豢养下的日本军国主义者，企图派兵出国、重走侵略亚洲的老路的野心。
    据《赤旗报》十九日报道，田中义男作为证人出席了十八日在北海道札幌地方裁判所（法院）举行的“惠庭事件”的第二十八次公审。在公审作证中，田中义男在被告的辩护人内藤功的追逼下，躲躲闪闪，竭力为美国侵略军和日本“自卫队”进行辩护，不敢接触问题的本质。但是他供认，日本现在已经建立了“日美联合作战调整所”，在“三矢作战计划”中，曾经设想“自卫队”进行作战以支援“联合国军”，“为了给敌人以决定性的打击，应当把作战行动扩大到日本领土以外的地区，这是战术上的起码原则。”日本“防卫厅”制定的“三矢作战计划”和各年度的“防卫计划”都是根据这个想法制定的。
    田中义男还供认，日本“海上自卫队”将同美军配合封锁对马海峡。为此，日美双方曾经多次进行过演习。田中还证实，在美国军队攻击外国基地时，日本“自卫队”协助美军进行侦察等活动。
    《赤旗报》指出，田中义男的证词揭穿了日本政府当局说什么“三矢作战计划”不过是“纸上谈兵”的谎言。
      “惠庭事件”是日美反动派为镇压日本农民反对日本“自卫队”而制造的事件。一九六二年十二月，北海道惠庭的一个农民为了保卫生活权利，切断了妨碍他们生产和生活的日本“陆上自卫队”演习场内的通讯线路。日本“自卫队”借口违反“自卫队法”诬控这个农民。日本民主力量同当局展开了斗争，指出日本“自卫队”的存在本身就是违反日本宪法的，并且通过斗争揭露了它的侵略性。
