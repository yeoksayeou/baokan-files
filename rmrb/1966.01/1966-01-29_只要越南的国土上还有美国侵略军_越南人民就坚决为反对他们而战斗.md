    Chairman Ho Chi Minh Writes to Chairman Liu Reaffirming the Vietnamese Government's Position
    As long as there are American aggressor troops on Vietnamese soil,
    The Vietnamese people will resolutely fight against them
    Solemnly exposes the US "peace seeking" offensive as a conspiracy to cover up its intensified war of aggression; the essence of the US's fourteen points is that the US wants to stubbornly remain in South Vietnam. Strongly protests the US's extremely barbaric war methods, calls on peace-loving governments of all countries and people around the world to resolutely stop the clutches of American war criminals. Firmly believes that the fraternal Chinese people and government will strengthen their support and assistance to the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, and resolutely condemns the American government's false peace tactics.
    Xinhua News Agency, 28th - Chairman Liu Shaoqi received a letter from Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on January 24. The full text of the letter is as follows:
Beijing, To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Esteemed Chairman:
    I solemnly bring to the attention of the Chairman the war of aggression waged by US imperialism in our Vietnam.
    As you know, for more than eleven years, US imperialism has seriously violated the 1954 Geneva Accords, obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and attempted to turn South Vietnam into a new-type colony and military base of the United States. Now, US imperialism is waging a war of aggression in South Vietnam, barbarously suppressing our patriotic compatriots in the South. At the same time, they are trying to draw lessons from this war to suppress national liberation movements in other regions.
    In order to salvage its deeply mired predicament in South Vietnam, US imperialism has dispatched a large number of US expeditionary forces and troops from some of its satellite countries to directly invade South Vietnam. US imperialism is also using its air force to bomb and strafe the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—an independent sovereign state and a member of the socialist camp.
    While strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, US imperialism is clamoring about having "sincere desire for peace" and being "ready at any time for unconditional discussions," attempting to deceive world public opinion and the American people. Recently, the Johnson administration launched a so-called "peace-seeking" campaign and put forward fourteen proposals. They defend their war of aggression against South Vietnam by saying that it is "fulfilling a promise" to the Saigon puppet regime and slander the patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people as "aggression by North Vietnam." This hypocritical argument cannot erase the solemn statement made by the United States in Geneva in 1954 that the United States "will not use threat or force to disturb them (the Geneva Accords)." President Johnson's hypocritical argument cannot cover up the crimes of the United States in Vietnam.
    The United States claims to respect the Geneva Accords. But one of the main provisions of this agreement is to prohibit foreign troops from entering Vietnam. If they truly respect this agreement, then they must withdraw all US and its satellite countries' troops from South Vietnam.
    Clearly, the United States is an aggressor trampling on Vietnamese soil. The South Vietnamese people are the aggressed who are waging a war of self-defense. If the United States truly wants peace, then the United States must recognize that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the sole genuine representative of the South Vietnamese people and must negotiate with the National Liberation Front. According to the wishes of the South Vietnamese people and the spirit of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam, the National Liberation Front is fighting for the realization of independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and ultimately the peaceful reunification of the fatherland in South Vietnam. If the United States truly respects the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination, then they cannot but approve of this correct program of the National Liberation Front.
    The essence of the US's fourteen points is that the US wants to stubbornly remain in South Vietnam, trying its best to maintain the puppet regime in South Vietnam that the United States has single-handedly fostered, and trying its best to divide our Vietnam for a long time.
    In his State of the Union address to the US Congress on January 12, 1966, President Johnson affirmed that the US policy is unwilling to withdraw from South Vietnam and wants the Vietnamese people to "choose between peace and destruction." This is a blatant threat, an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to accept the conditions of the US's so-called "unconditional discussions."
    The Vietnamese people will never yield to the threats of US imperialism at any time.
    Just as the US government is making so-called new "peace efforts," they are massively increasing the number of American troops sent to South Vietnam. They are stepping up sweeps, implementing a "scorched earth" policy of burning all, destroying all, and killing all, using napalm, poison gas, and chemical agents to destroy villages and massacre civilians in vast areas of South Vietnam.
    I strongly protest against these extremely barbaric war methods of the United States. I earnestly appeal to the peace-loving governments of all countries and peace-loving people all over the world to resolutely stop the clutches of American war criminals.
    The United States continues to send aircraft for reconnaissance, preparing for new bombings of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    On the other hand, the United States is using aircraft to bomb many areas of the Kingdom of Laos, intensifying armed provocations against the Kingdom of Cambodia, making the peace in Indochina even more seriously threatened.
    Clearly, the US's "peace-seeking" offensive is merely a cover for its conspiracy to intensify the war of aggression. The Johnson administration's position remains one of aggression and expansion of the war.
    In order to solve the Vietnam problem, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward four positions that embody the main provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam. This is a peaceful position.
    The Vietnamese people, having experienced more than 20 years of war, desire peace more than anyone else in order to build their own lives. However, true peace cannot be separated from true independence. As long as there are American aggressor troops on our soil, our people will resolutely fight against them. If the US government truly wants a peaceful solution, then they must recognize the four positions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and prove it with practical actions; they must permanently and unconditionally stop the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Only then can a political solution to the Vietnam problem be considered. Esteemed Chairman,
    To this day, the fraternal Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, upholding the spirit of international solidarity, have given full support and assistance to our Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the defense of the independence and freedom of our country. On behalf of the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I express my deep gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China.
    Faced with the extremely serious situation created by the United States in Vietnam, I firmly believe that the fraternal Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China will strengthen their support and assistance to our people's just struggle, resolutely condemn the US government's false peace tactics, and promptly stop all new and malicious conspiracies of the United States in Vietnam and Indochina.
    Taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my highest regards to the Chairman.
              Ho Chi Minh
              President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
              Hanoi, January 24, 1966
    Attachment: The Four Positions of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    The consistent position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to strictly respect the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam, to correctly implement the basic provisions of this agreement, specifically embodied in the following points:
    1. Affirm the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people: peace, independence, sovereignty, unification, and territorial integrity. According to the Geneva Accords, the US government must withdraw US troops, military personnel, and all kinds of weapons from South Vietnam, abolish US military bases in South Vietnam, cancel its "military alliance" with South Vietnam, and at the same time stop its policy of interference and aggression against South Vietnam. According to the Geneva Accords, the US government must stop its acts of war against North Vietnam and completely stop all activities that violate the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    2. During the period waiting for Vietnam to achieve peaceful unification, when Vietnam is still temporarily divided into two regions, the military provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam must be thoroughly respected, such as neither region should conclude military alliances with foreign countries, and neither should retain foreign military bases, troops, or military personnel in its region.
    3. The affairs of South Vietnam must be resolved by the South Vietnamese people themselves according to the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, without foreign interference.
    4. The issue of realizing the peaceful unification of Vietnam should be resolved by the Vietnamese people of the two regions themselves, without foreign interference.
    This position will surely receive the sympathy and support of the governments and people of all countries in the world who love peace and justice.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the above-mentioned position is the basis for the most correct political solution to the Vietnam problem. Recognizing this basis will create conditions for a smooth peaceful solution to the Vietnam problem, and it will then be possible to talk about holding an international conference in the style of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Vietnam.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that all solutions that violate the above-mentioned position are inappropriate, and all solutions that attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnam are also inappropriate, because this type of solution fundamentally violates the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

### 只要越南的国土上还有美国侵略军  越南人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗

    胡志明主席写信给刘主席重申越南政府立场
    只要越南的国土上还有美国侵略军
    越南人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗
    严正揭露美国“寻求和平”攻势是为了掩饰其加强侵略战争的阴谋；美国十四点的实质是美国要死赖在南越。强烈抗议美国极其野蛮的战争手段，呼吁爱好和平的各国政府和全世界人民坚决制止美国战争罪犯的魔爪。深信兄弟的中国人民和政府将会加强对越南人民正义斗争的支持和援助，坚决谴责美国政府的假和平手段。
    新华社二十八日讯　刘少奇主席收到了越南民主共和国主席胡志明一月二十四日的一封信，信件全文如下：北京中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志敬爱的主席同志：
    我郑重地提请主席同志注意美帝国主义在我们越南进行的侵略战争。
    如您所知道的，十一年多来，美帝国主义严重地破坏了一九五四年日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一，企图把越南南方变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地。现在，美帝国主义正在越南南方进行侵略战争，野蛮地镇压我国南方的爱国同胞。同时，他们企图从这场战争中吸取经验，用以镇压其他地区的民族解放运动。
    美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方泥足深陷的困境，派遣了大批美国远征军及其部分仆从国家的军队直接侵略越南南方。美帝国主义还使用空军轰炸扫射越南民主共和国——一个独立的主权国家、社会主义阵营的成员。
    美帝国主义一面加强和扩大侵略越南的战争，一面叫嚷有“和平诚意”、“时刻准备无条件讨论”，企图欺骗世界舆论和美国人民。最近，约翰逊政府开展了一个所谓“寻求和平”的运动，并提出了十四点建议。他们为其对越南南方的侵略战争辩护说，这是对西贡的傀儡走狗政权“履行诺言”，并且诬蔑越南南方人民的爱国斗争是“越南北方的侵略”。这一虚伪的论调绝不能勾消美国于一九五四年在日内瓦所作的郑重声明，即美国“将不使用威胁或武力去妨害它们（日内瓦协议）”。约翰逊总统的虚伪论调更无法掩饰美国在越南的罪行。
    美国声称尊重日内瓦协议。但是这一协议的主要条款之一就是禁止外国军队进入越南。如果他们真正尊重这一协议，那他们就必须把美国及其仆从国家的军队全部撤出越南南方。
    显然，美国是正在践踏越南国土的侵略者。越南南方人民是正在进行自卫战斗的被侵略者。如果美国真正希望和平的话，那么美国就必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正代表，并必须同民族解放阵线进行商谈。民族解放阵线根据越南南方人民的愿望和一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的精神，正为在越南南方实现独立、民主、和平、中立、进而和平统一祖国而斗争。如果美国真正尊重越南南方人民的自决权，那他们就不能不赞成民族解放阵线的这一正确纲领。
    美国的十四点的实质是，美国要死赖在越南南方，竭力维持美国在越南南方一手扶植起来的傀儡政权，竭力长期分割我们越南。
    约翰逊总统在他一九六六年一月十二日向美国国会提出的国情咨文中，肯定了美国的政策是不肯撤离越南南方，并要越南人民“在和平与破坏之间作一抉择”。这是露骨的威胁，是企图强迫越南人民接受美国的所谓“无条件讨论”的条件。
    越南人民任何时候都绝不向美帝国主义的威胁屈服。
    正当美国政府作出所谓新的“和平努力”的同时，他们向越南南方大肆增派美军。他们加紧进行扫荡，实行烧光、毁光、杀光的“焦土”政策，使用凝固汽油弹、毒气和化学毒剂在越南南方的广大地区破坏村庄、屠杀平民。
    我强烈抗议美国这些极其野蛮的战争手段。我恳切呼吁爱好和平的各国政府和全世界爱好和平的人民坚决制止美国战争罪犯的魔爪。
    美国继续派出飞机进行侦察，准备对越南民主共和国进行新的轰炸。
    另一方面，美国使用飞机空袭老挝王国的许多地区，加紧对柬埔寨王国的武装挑衅，使印度支那的和平更加遭受到严重威胁。
    显然，美国的“寻求和平”攻势只是为了掩饰其加强侵略战争的阴谋。约翰逊政府的立场依然是侵略和扩大战争。
    为了解决越南问题，越南民主共和国政府已经提出了体现一九五四年关于越南问题日内瓦协议的主要条款的四项立场。这是和平的立场。
    越南人民经历了二十多年的战争，比任何人都更加渴望和平，以便建设自己的生活。但是，真正的和平决不能离开真正的独立。只要我们的国土上还有美国侵略军，我国人民就坚决为反对他们而战斗。如果美国政府真正愿意和平解决，那么他们就必须承认越南民主共和国的四项立场，并且以实际行动来证明；必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和一切其他战争行动。这样才能考虑到越南问题的政治解决办法。敬爱的主席同志，
    至今，兄弟的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府发扬国际团结的精神，对我们越南人民反抗美帝国主义侵略、保卫祖国的独立和自由的斗争给予了全力的支持和援助。我谨代表越南人民和越南民主共和国政府，向兄弟的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府表示深深的感谢。
    面对着美国在越南造成的极其严重的局势，我深信兄弟的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府将会加强对我国人民正义斗争的支持和援助，坚决谴责美国政府的假和平手段，并且及时制止美国在越南和印度支那的一切新的恶毒阴谋。
    借此机会，我谨向主席同志致以最崇高的敬意。
              越南民主共和国主席　胡志明
              一九六六年一月二十四日于河内
    附件：越南民主共和国政府的四项立场
    越南民主共和国政府始终不渝的立场是，严正尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，正确履行这个协议的基本条款，具体体现在以下几点：
    一、确认越南人民的基本民族权利：和平、独立、主权、统一和领土完整。根据日内瓦协议，美国政府必须把美国的军队、军事人员和各种武器从越南南方撤走，撤销美国在越南南方的军事基地，取消同南越的“军事同盟”，同时停止对越南南方的干涉和侵略政策。根据日内瓦协议，美国政府必须停止对越南北方的战争行动，完全停止侵犯越南民主共和国领土和主权的一切活动。
    二、在等待越南实现和平统一期间，在越南还暂时被分割为两个地区的时候，必须彻底尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的各项军事条款，如两地区都不得同外国缔结军事同盟，不得在自己的地区保留有外国的军事基地、军队和军事人员。
    三、越南南方事务，必须由越南南方人民根据越南南方民族解放阵线纲领自己来解决，不许外国干涉。
    四、实现越南和平统一的问题，应由两个地区的越南人民自己来解决，不许外国干涉。
    这个立场肯定会受到世界上爱好和平和公理的各国政府和人民的同情和支持。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，上面所说的立场是越南问题的最正确的政治解决途径的基础。承认这个基础，和平解决越南问题将会有顺利进行的条件，才能够谈到举行一九五四年关于越南问题日内瓦会议式的国际会议。
    越南民主共和国政府声明，一切违反上述立场的解决途径都是不适宜的，一切想用联合国来干涉越南的解决途径也都是不适宜的，因为这种解决的途径从根本上违反了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。
