    Reporting to Relatives in the Capital from the Tibetan Plateau
    We have been in Tibet for several months since leaving Beijing.

    On our way from Beijing to Tibet, we passed through deserts, grasslands, and snow-capped mountains. The unpredictable plateau climate brought us difficulties. The more difficulties we faced, the more we read Chairman Mao's books. Chairman Mao said, "The more difficult the place, the more you should go, that is a good comrade." Chairman Mao's words warmed everyone's hearts. We carried forward the spirit of mutual help during the journey and successfully arrived in Tibet.

    After arriving in Tibet, we first visited the "Tibet Revolution Exhibition Hall." We saw rosaries made from the skulls of slaves and the noses and limbs of slaves that were cut off by slave owners... All this deepened our hatred for the evil slave system, increased our sympathy and love for the Tibetan working people, and further strengthened our determination to dedicate ourselves to the class brothers in Tibet. Everyone solemnly swore to the Party: "Be Red in Tibet, be expert in Tibet, and devote a lifetime to revolution in Tibet!"

    Our current labor is building roads. Carrying stones to build roads is indeed very tiring. Sometimes when I carried halfway, a struggle arose in my mind – should I stop or put down two stones! But then I immediately thought, we are here to temper ourselves, to build! How can we do it without enduring hardship? Comrade Wang Jie was able to endure hardship in ordinary times, so he could be unafraid of death at the critical moment. In this way, although very tired, we felt extremely happy in spirit.

    We grew up in the capital. Having come to Tibet, we must firmly remember the teachings and expectations of the Party organization and our relatives in Beijing. We must take root in the great southwest of the motherland, strive to join the Communist Party as soon as possible, and please wait for our news of victory, people of the capital!

    在西藏高原向首都亲人汇报
    我们离京进藏已经几个月了。
    从北京到西藏，我们一路经过了沙漠、草地和雪山，变化无常的高原气候给我们带来了困难。越是困难的时候，我们越要读毛主席的书。毛主席说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的话温暖了大家的心。我们在旅途中发扬了互相帮助的精神，胜利到达西藏。
    到西藏后，我们先参观“西藏革命展览馆”。看到了用奴隶的头盖骨做成的佛珠和被奴隶主割下来、砍下来的奴隶的鼻子和手脚……这一切，都加深了我们对罪恶的奴隶制度的憎恨，增长了对西藏劳动人民的同情和热爱，更坚定了我们为西藏阶级兄弟献身的决心。大家庄严地向党宣誓：“红在西藏，专在西藏，在西藏干一辈子革命！”
    我们现在的劳动是修公路。背石头修路确实很累，有时我背到半路，脑子里起了斗争，停下来或者拿下两块石头吧！可是马上又一想，我们是来锻炼的，是来建设的，不吃苦怎能行？王杰同志就是平时能吃苦，在节骨眼上才能不怕死。这样，虽然很累，但精神上却感到无比愉快。
    我们是在首都长大的，来到西藏，我们一定要牢牢记住党组织和北京亲人对我们的教导和期望。我们一定在祖国的大西南扎下根来，争取早日参加共产党，请首都人民等待我们的胜利消息吧！
