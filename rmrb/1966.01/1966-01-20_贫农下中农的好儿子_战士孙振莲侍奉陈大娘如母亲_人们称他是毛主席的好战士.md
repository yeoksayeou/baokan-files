    The naval observation post of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is stationed on a peninsula. Carrying forward the glorious tradition of supporting the government and cherishing the people, they often do good deeds for the masses and are deeply praised by the local people. The fishermen call them good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Here, let's just talk about the touching deeds of Sun Zhenlian.
    On the island lives a "five-guarantee" household in her seventies named Chen Guolan. She came from a poor background, and her husband and several sons were killed by the Kuomintang… After liberation, the old woman's life was guaranteed. But because of her old age and frailty, she still had to trouble her neighbors with fetching firewood and water. Seeing this, Sun Zhenlian took on the responsibility of fetching firewood and water for Granny Chen, rain or shine, year after year, for three years. When Granny Chen needed firewood, he would go up the mountain to chop it; when the water jar was empty, he would fetch water; when the old woman was sick, he would help her with this and that like her own son. Every Spring Festival and holiday, he would save the peanuts and candies he received and send them to the old woman…
    Once, the old woman said to him, feeling very sorry, "Child, you haven't even drunk my milk, why are you so good to me, how can I thank you!"
      "This is what Chairman Mao told us to do. If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao!" Sun Zhenlian's words reminded the old woman of her miserable life before liberation, and tears welled up in her eyes. She said excitedly that she had lived for over seventy years and had never even seen an image of Chairman Mao. So, Sun Zhenlian helped her to the commune office to see the image of Chairman Mao. After that, whenever Sun Zhenlian went to visit her, Granny Chen always clamored to see the image of Chairman Mao. Later, Sun Zhenlian went to the city and bought a colored image of Chairman Mao to hang in her home. From then on, the old woman often talked to herself in front of the image of Chairman Mao, saying: I never thought that I, an old woman, who suffered all my life, would live to be over seventy years old and still have such a good son. This is thanks to you, old man!

    贫农下中农的好儿子
    战士孙振莲侍奉陈大娘如母亲　人们称他是毛主席的好战士
    中国人民解放军海军某部观通站，住在一个半岛上。他们发扬拥政爱民的光荣传统，常为群众做好事，深受当地群众的赞扬，渔民们称他们是毛主席的好战士。这里，只谈谈孙振莲的动人事迹。
    岛上有一个七十多岁的五保户，名叫陈国兰，出身贫苦，丈夫和几个儿子被国民党害死……。解放后老人的生活才有了保证。但由于年老体弱，烧柴、挑水不免还要麻烦左邻右舍。孙振莲见此情形，就把陈老大娘的烧柴、用水全包下来，不管是雪是旱，还是刮风下雨，他终年不断，三年如一日。陈老大娘要用柴，他就上山砍；缸里没有水，他就去挑；老人病了，他就象她的儿子一样帮她做这做那。每逢过年过节，他把发的花生、糖果省下来，给老大娘送去……。
    有次老人很不过意地对他说：“孩子，你又没吃过俺的奶水，为什么对俺这么好，叫俺如何来感谢你呐！”
      “这是毛主席叫我们这样做的，你要感谢就感谢毛主席他老人家吧！”孙振莲这一席话，使老大娘想起解放前的悲惨生活，眼泪就夺眶而出，激动地说：自己活了七十多岁，连毛主席象还没有看见过。于是，孙振莲就扶着她到公社办公室去看毛主席象。以后，当孙振莲每次去探望她时，陈老大娘总是嚷着要去看毛主席象。后来，孙振莲进城去买了一张毛主席五色象挂在她的家里。从此，老大娘经常对着毛主席象自言自语地说：真没想到我这个老婆子，受了一辈子的苦，活了七十多岁，还得了这么一个好儿子，这是俺托了你老人家的福啊！
