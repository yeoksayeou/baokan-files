    Requirements for Grassroots Cadres
    The leaders of the brigade and production team are the Party's most direct leaders, organizers, and educators of the masses. The Party's policies and guidelines must be disseminated and implemented through them, and the Party's tasks must be executed and completed by them. At the same time, the vast majority of the masses' demands and opinions must be constantly and continuously reported upwards through them. However, at present, many of our grassroots cadres cannot shoulder such a heavy responsibility. Some comrades, after attending a meeting in the commune, cannot even bring the most basic spirit of the meeting to the masses. Some production team leaders, after attending a meeting at the commune or brigade for a day or two, finish speaking in a few words when they return. Therefore, the masses reflect: "The commune talks about policies, the brigade talks about principles, the production team talks about half of it, and the commune members don't understand." Even the better ones can only explain what work needs to be done currently, but they cannot explain how to do it or why it needs to be done this way.
    Therefore, I hope that the county party committee's leadership departments will focus on helping, educating, and cultivating grassroots cadres, so that rural grassroots cadres can grow up rapidly like Chen Yonggui, Zhou Mingshan, Dong Jiageng, Zhao Yun, and Xing Yanzi, and build our socialist new countryside even more beautifully and magnificently!

### 基层干部的要求

    基层干部的要求
    大队和生产队的领导，是党对群众最直接的领导者，组织者和教育者。党的方针政策，要通过他们去传达贯彻，党的各项任务，要他们去执行完成。同时，群众中有些什么要求和意见，绝大多数又要靠他们经常地、不断地向上反映。但是，目前我们有不少基层干部，就肩负不了这样的重任，有的同志到公社开了会以后，连最基本的会议精神，也带不到群众中去。有的生产队长，在公社、大队开一两天会议，回去几句话就说完了。因此群众反映说：“公社讲政策，大队讲原则，生产队讲半截，社员不晓得”。一般比较好的，也只能说清当前要搞些什么工作，至于怎样搞，为什么要这样搞，就说不清楚了。
    所以，我希望县委领导部门，抓好对基层干部的帮助、教育和培养，让农村基层干部都象陈永贵、周明山、董加耕、赵耘、邢燕子等那样迅速地成长起来，把我们的社会主义新农村，建设得更加美好和壮丽！四川广汉县兴隆公社一大队
