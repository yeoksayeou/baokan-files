    China's international status is steadily increasing
    The whole world is paying attention to China's movements
    This year's world situation remains the same as last year, with China's influence shaking Asia and, based on this, shaking the world. In the UN General Assembly vote on the decision regarding China's representation in November, the number of votes in favor and against using a simple majority decision became equal, which leads one to believe that China's international status is steadily and smoothly increasing.

    China's path has left a stronger impression on the entire world. Its high posture stuns the world. It can be said that China, having successfully conducted its second nuclear test, has achieved an undeniable great power status on the international stage, as seen in the UN General Assembly "vote" on China's representation and the adoption, without objection, of a resolution to convene a world disarmament conference including China.

    The movements of Communist China remain one of the most watched issues in world politics. Communist China has become a nuclear power and is continuing to strive to develop nuclear weapons, which has increasingly raised its status in world politics.
    The issue lies in China's domestic construction and the growth of strength demonstrated by the nuclear tests. In the long run, ignoring China's existence is probably impossible. China's shadow has already enveloped Asia. China's future movements are a crucial key to determining Asia's tomorrow.

          China Firmly Supports the Struggle of the Vietnamese People
          The United States Has Already Considered China as the Main Danger

    Regarding the issue of US-China relations, the Vietnam War rapidly intensified last year, and Communist China supported North Vietnam in thoroughly resisting the war.
    The United States has devoted itself to bilateral treaties and invested unprecedentedly large military forces in South Vietnam. The tendency to strengthen the unity of Japan-US, US-South Korea, and US-Hua (should be the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang) in Northeast Asia has already appeared. The main target of the various bilateral treaties concluded with the United States as the axis is no longer the Soviet Union, but Communist China. In particular, this is a natural trend targeting Communist China, which may possess substantial nuclear weapons in five years. At the end of last year, US Secretary of Defense McNamara said: "Communist China may begin to store nuclear weapons and medium-range ballistic missiles with a range reaching Berlin and San Francisco by 1967." Because there are no channels of communication between the US and China, there is a risk of increased tension.

    We all see more clearly than in the past few years that the center of world politics has shifted from Europe to Asia. China, a world power, is seen as today's danger and even tomorrow's danger in the eyes of most Americans, and probably also in the eyes of the Russians.

          Saying China is "Isolated" Does Not Conform to the Facts
            The Attempt to "Contain" China is Difficult to Achieve

    We have heard that Communist China has recently been isolated by the world. However, the result of the proposal on China's representation in the United Nations General Assembly was that the votes for and against were exactly the same. The number of votes supporting Communist China's "joining" the United Nations is increasing every year, and finally, it has reached this state, which is an indisputable fact. The resolution on convening a world disarmament conference including Communist China can be said to have once again highlighted the position that Communist China occupies in the international community.

    Can the attempt by China to make itself the driving force of international revolution be controlled? This is the biggest unknown in the mid-1960s. No one dares to bet on this. The past year has shown that containing China will be more difficult than containing Russia in the Stalin era.

### 中国的影响震撼着世界

    中国的影响震撼着世界
    中国国际地位越来越提高
    全世界都注意中国的动向
    今年的世界形势仍同去年一样，是中国的影响震撼着亚洲，并且据此而震撼着世界。在十一月联大关于决定中国代表权的投票中，赞成和反对使用单纯多数决定方式的票数变得相等了，这使人认为中国的国际地位正在稳步而顺利地提高。
                          日本共同社
                    一九六五年十二月十一日
    中国走过来的足迹，给全世界以更加强烈的印象。它的高姿态使全世界瞠目。可以说，成功地进行了第二次核试验的中国，就象在联合国大会“表决”中国代表权问题、在没有反对意见的情况下通过召开包括中国在内的世界裁军会议的决议的那样，已经在国际舞台上取得了不可忽视的大国地位。
                    日本《读卖新闻》
                  一九六五年十二月三十一日
    共产党中国的动向，仍然是世界政治中的最受注意的事情之一。共产党中国已经成为核国家，而且在继续努力发展核武器，已经越来越提高了它在世界政治上的地位。
    问题在于中国的国内建设，在于核试验所表现的实力的增长，从长远看，无视中国的存在，恐怕是不可能的。中国的影子已经笼罩亚洲。中国今后的动向，是决定亚洲明天的重要关键。　　　　日本《朝日新闻》
                        一九六六年一月一日
          中国坚决支援越南人民的斗争
          美国已把中国看成是主要危险
    关于美中关系问题，去年越南战争迅速激化，共产党中国支援北越彻底抗战。
    美国致力于双边条约，在南越投入了空前庞大的军事力量。在东北亚加强日美、美韩、美华（应为蒋介石匪帮）团结的倾向已经出现。以美国为轴心而缔结的各个双边条约所针对的主要对象已经不再是苏联，而是共产党中国。特别是针对五年以后可能拥有充实的核武器的共产党中国，这是当然的趋势。去年年底美国国防部长麦克纳马拉说：“共产党中国到一九六七年可能开始贮存核武器和射程可达到柏林、旧金山范围的中程弹道导弹。”因为美中之间没有互相沟通的管道，这就有紧张倍增的危险。

                                          一九六六年一月一日
    我们大家比过去几年看得更清楚，世界政治重心已从欧洲移到了亚洲。中国这个世界大国在大多数美国人眼里，是今天的危险甚至还是明天的危险，在俄国人眼里大概也是这样。

          说中国受“孤立”不符合事实
            “遏制”中国的图谋难以得逞
    我们听到共产党中国最近被世界孤立了。但是在联合国大会对中国代表权问题的提案的结果就是赞成和反对的完全是同数。支持共产党中国“加入”联合国的票数每年在增加，终于到了这种状态，这是不容争辩的事实。关于召开包括共产党中国在内的世界裁军会议的决议，可以说再次把共产党中国在国际社会上所占的地位突出出来了。

                                        一九六五年十二月
    能不能把中国想使自己成为国际革命的动力机的企图控制住呢？这是六十年代中期最大的未知数。还没有人敢对此打赌。过去一年表明，要遏制中国将比在斯大林时代遏制俄国更加难办。
