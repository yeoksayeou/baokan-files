    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th, the Japanese Communist Party’s newspaper *Akahata* published an article on the 9th, exposing the United States’ so-called “peace offensive” on the Vietnam issue as nothing more than a mask to conceal its continued expansion of the war of aggression.

    The article stated that if the United States is truly sincere, then it should first admit its guilt for violating the Geneva Accords, withdraw its troops and bases from South Vietnam, and allow the Vietnamese people to solve the Vietnam problem themselves.

    The article said that Johnson's recent dispatch of special envoys to various parties to peddle his fourteen-point plan is a true attempt to: 1. Pretend that the United States has “peaceful sincerity” to deceive world opinion; 2. Seek new cooperation with the United States from some countries and forces, including the Soviet Union, on the Vietnam issue; 3. Require countries such as Britain, Japan, and Thailand, which assist and participate in the aggression against Vietnam, to strengthen their support for the United States, with great expectations placed on its military ally, Japan; 4. Unite the right-wingers of the "non-aligned countries", modern revisionists, and Japan, etc., as much as possible to exert political pressure on the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

    Kenzo Nakajima, Director of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, condemned modern revisionists for following the United States and peddling “peaceful coexistence” to serve so-called “unconditional” negotiations.

    Fan Shiraishi, Chairman of the Japanese Liaison Committee of the Asian-African Writers' Conference, pointed out that after the United States plays its "peace offensive," it may expand the flames of aggression against Vietnam to Laos and Cambodia.

    Makoto Hori, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee for Abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and Striving to Realize Various Demands, said that the U.S. "peace offensive" is merely to buy time to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam to Laos, Cambodia, and other regions.

    Yoko Matsuoka, a famous Japanese commentator, pointed out that the United States is making every effort to publicize its suspension of bombing North Vietnam, which seems to be a "concession" and a step towards "peace," but in reality, it is now transferring troops to South Vietnam, strengthening its military bases in Thailand and other places, and strengthening preparations for expanding the war.

    Tatsuo Niina, a Japanese military commentator, said that the United States is preparing to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, impose a naval blockade on North Vietnam, and prepare to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina.

    美国谋求同苏联合作向越南人民施加压力
    中岛健藏谴责现代修正主义者鼓吹“和平共处”为美帝骗局效劳
    据新华社东京十日电  日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》九日发表文章，揭露美国关于越南问题的所谓“和平攻势”，不过是为了掩盖它继续扩大侵略战争的一张画皮。
    文章说，美国如果真有诚意，那末它首先应该对它违反日内瓦协议的行为低头认罪，从南越撤兵和撤除基地，让越南人民自己解决越南问题。
    文章说，约翰逊最近向各方面派出特使，四处推销它的十四点计划，其真正的企图是：一、假装美国有“和平的诚意”，以欺骗世界舆论；二、谋求包括苏联在内的一些国家和势力在越南问题上同美国进行新的合作；三、要求英国、日本、泰国等协助和参与侵略越南的国家加强对美国的支持，在这里，对它的军事同盟者日本的期待很大；四、尽可能使“不结盟国家”的右派和现代修正主义者以及日本等联合起来，向越南人民的正义斗争施加政治压力。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏谴责现代修正主义者跟在美国后边，鼓吹“和平共处”为所谓“无条件”谈判效劳。
    亚非作家会议日本联络委员会主席白石凡指出，美国在玩弄“和平攻势”之后，有可能把侵略越南的战火扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。
    废除日美“安全条约”争取实现各种要求中央实行委员会事务局长堀真琴说，美国的“和平攻势”，只不过是为争取时间，把侵略越南的战争升级到老挝、柬埔寨以及其他地区。
    日本著名评论家松冈洋子指出，美国竭力宣传它暂停轰炸北越，似乎是一种“让步”，是走向“和平”的步骤，实际上它现在正向南越调兵遣将，加强在泰国等地的军事基地，加强扩大战争的准备。
    日本军事评论家新名丈夫说，美国正在准备轰炸河内、海防，对越南北方实行海上封锁，并且准备把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。
