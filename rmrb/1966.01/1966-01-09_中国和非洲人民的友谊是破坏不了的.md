    The governments of Dahomey and the Central African Republic, disregarding the wishes of the vast majority of their people and patriotic individuals who desire to develop friendly cooperative relations with China, announced one after another on January 3rd and January 6th the termination and severance of diplomatic relations with China. The Chinese people cannot but express their indignation and protest against this grave act by the Dahomey and Central African authorities in severely damaging their normal relations with China.
    This practice by the governments of Dahomey and the Central African Republic is completely unreasonable and violates the most basic norms of international relations. In their official notes to China announcing the termination and severance of diplomatic relations with China, they did not present any reasons at all, nor could they possibly present any. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Dahomey and the Central African Republic, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, striving to develop friendly cooperative relations and enhance the friendship between the peoples. The Chinese embassies in these two countries have fulfilled their duties and made positive contributions towards this noble mission. This is an undeniable fact. The current practice of the Dahomey and Central African governments is a perfidious act of unilaterally tearing up the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations. It cannot damage China's prestige in the slightest; on the contrary, it can only damage the international reputation of Dahomey and the Central African Republic themselves. The Dahomey and Central African authorities should bear full responsibility for the damage to the normal relations between Dahomey, the Central African Republic, and China.
    The announcements by the Dahomey and Central African authorities of the termination and severance of diplomatic relations with China both occurred after military coups in the two countries, which is by no means accidental. Imperialism, headed by the United States, has always been hostile to the development of friendly cooperative relations between China and Dahomey and the Central African Republic, and has tried to undermine such relations in order to achieve its ulterior motives. Last October, William, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, arrived in Dahomey to engage in extensive activities, clamoring about the "danger of communism." Immediately afterwards, U.S. imperialism directed the Chiang Kai-shek gang to send its so-called "ambassador" stationed in Togo to Dahomey to conduct conspiracies. It is not difficult to see the background of the Dahomey incident.
    Similarly, a military coup occurred in the Central African Republic on January 1st, and then the imperialist propaganda machine released a great deal of air, saying that the coup authorities in the Central African Republic would sever diplomatic relations with China. However, on January 5th, the government of the Central African Republic officially stated to our country that "the new government of the Central African Republic hopes to maintain diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China," but the next day, the Central African government suddenly changed its attitude and notified the Chinese embassy, announcing the severance of diplomatic relations. At the same time, Bokassa, the head of the new government of the Central African Republic, hurriedly issued a statement, making wild accusations and slanders against China. In order to cover up his extremely unreasonable behavior, Bokassa had to resort to spreading rumors, saying that "weapons and documents" had been discovered. This is purely nonsense. From these circumstances, it is not difficult for people to see that this unreasonable action taken by the coup government of the Central African Republic was entirely the result of imperialist planning.
    Imperialism, headed by the United States, is stirring up an anti-China current in Africa, attempting to sow discord between China and African countries' normal relations and undermine the militant friendship and unity between the Chinese and African people. Imperialism's planning of Dahomey and the Central African Republic's termination and severance of diplomatic relations with China is an integral part of this anti-China current. U.S. imperialism and its followers are inciting anti-China sentiment in Africa because they fear the upsurge of the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. They are trying to strangle the independence and sovereignty of African countries and suppress the national liberation movement in Africa. As Radio Guinea said in its commentary on the coups in the Central African Republic and other countries, "Imperialist policy attempts to re-colonize this continent through the planned and massive exploitation of Africa." However, the imperialists' conspiracy cannot succeed, and the African people's anti-imperialist struggle is rising day by day. The Chinese government and people unswervingly support the struggle of the people of all African countries against imperialism and new and old colonialism and for national independence. The fact that imperialism and its lackeys are inciting anti-China sentiment in Africa proves precisely that the militant friendship between the Chinese people and the people of African countries in unity against imperialism has been strengthened, and that they themselves are becoming increasingly isolated in Africa and their situation is getting worse and worse.
    The Chinese people and the people of African countries had a common fate of suffering from imperialist oppression in the past, and have conducted a common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Today, we still face the same tasks of opposing imperialism and colonialism and building our respective countries. The Chinese people and the African people are brothers who share weal and woe, and comrades-in-arms fighting shoulder to shoulder. This deep friendship and militant solidarity between the Chinese people and the African people cannot be destroyed by imperialism or any reactionary forces.

    中国和非洲人民的友谊是破坏不了的
    本报评论员
    达荷美和中非两国政府无视国内广大人民和爱国人士要求同中国发展友好合作关系的意愿，竟先后于一月三日和一月六日宣布终止和断绝同中国的外交关系。中国人民对于达荷美和中非当局的这种严重破坏它们同中国的正常关系的行为，不能不表示愤慨和抗议。
    达荷美和中非政府的这种做法是毫无道理的，是违反了最起码的国际关系准则的。它们在宣布同中国终止和断绝外交关系时致中国的正式照会中，根本没有提出任何理由，也不可能提出任何理由来。自从中国和达荷美、中非共和国建交以来，中国政府一贯信守和平共处五项原则，努力发展相互间的友好合作关系和增进人民之间的友谊。中国驻这两个国家的大使馆，为了这个崇高的使命克尽了自己的职责，作出了积极的贡献。这是有目共睹的事实。达荷美和中非政府现在的这种作法，完全是一种片面撕毁建交协议的背信弃义的行为。它绝不能丝毫损害中国的威信，相反地只能损害达荷美和中非两国自己的国际声誉。达荷美、中非同中国之间的正常关系遭到破坏，应该由达荷美和中非当局承担全部的责任。
    达荷美和中非两国当局宣布终止和断绝同中国的外交关系，这两个事件都发生在两国的军事政变之后，这绝不是偶然的。以美国为首的帝国主义一贯敌视中国与达荷美、中非之间的友好合作关系的发展，力图破坏这种关系，以便达到它们不可告人的目的。去年十月间，美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿威廉斯到达荷美大肆活动，叫嚷什么“共产主义的危险”。紧接着，美帝国主义就指使蒋介石匪帮派出它驻多哥的所谓“大使”到达荷美进行阴谋活动。这就不难看出达荷美这个事件发生的背景。
    同样，中非共和国在一月一日发生了军事政变，接着帝国主义的宣传机构就大放空气，说中非的政变当局要同中国断交。可是，中非共和国政府一月五日正式向我国表示“中非共和国新政府希望同中华人民共和国保持外交关系”，而第二天，中非政府却突然改变态度，照会中国大使馆，宣布断交。同时，中非新政府的首脑博卡萨匆匆忙忙地发表了一项声明，对中国大肆进行诬蔑和诽谤。为了掩盖他的这种极端无理的行为，博卡萨不得不乞灵于造谣，说什么发现了“武器和文件”。这纯粹是胡说八道。从这些情况中，人们不难看出，中非政变政府采取的这一无理行动，完全是帝国主义者策划的结果。
    以美国为首的帝国主义，在非洲正在掀起一股反华逆流，力图挑拨中国和非洲各国的正常关系，破坏中国和非洲人民的战斗友谊和团结。帝国主义策划达荷美和中非同中国终止和断绝外交关系，正是这种反华逆流的一个组成部分。美帝国主义及其追随者在非洲煽动反华，是由于它们害怕非洲人民反帝革命斗争的高涨，它们力图扼杀非洲国家的独立和主权，镇压非洲的民族解放运动。正如几内亚电台在评论中非等国政变时所说的，“帝国主义政策企图通过有计划地大肆剥削非洲来使这一大陆重新殖民化”。但是，帝国主义的阴谋是不能得逞的，非洲人民反帝斗争在日益高涨。中国政府和人民坚持不渝地支持非洲各国人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。帝国主义及其走狗在非洲煽动反华，正说明中国人民同非洲各国人民团结反帝的战斗友谊加强了，正说明它们自己在非洲越来越孤立，日子越来越不好过了。
    中国人民和非洲各国人民，过去有遭受帝国主义压迫的共同命运，进行过反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争；现在，我们仍然面临着反对帝国主义和殖民主义，建设各自国家的相同的任务。中国人民和非洲人民是休戚相关的兄弟，是并肩战斗的战友。中国人民和非洲人民的这种深厚友谊和战斗团结，是帝国主义和任何反动势力所破坏不了的。
