    Punish the Heinous American Imperialist Accomplices with Bitter Hatred
    South Vietnamese Binh Dinh Province Guerrillas Annihilate Over Three Hundred South Korean Troops
    Hanoi, January 18th (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the guerrillas of Binh Dinh Province achieved a great victory in the battle against the “mopping up” operations of the South Korean mercenary troops on the 9th. Preliminary reports indicate that they annihilated 372 enemy soldiers and shot down two enemy helicopters.
    Recently, the South Korean mercenary troops dispatched six battalions to carry out "mopping up" operations, slaughtering the South Vietnamese people. The local guerrillas, with bitter hatred, fiercely attacked the South Korean mercenary troops in Nhan Phong, Nhan Thanh, and Phuc Hung on January 9th, killing and wounding many enemies to avenge the deaths of their compatriots. The remaining enemy troops fled in disarray.
    The South Korean mercenary troops commit all kinds of evil and have committed countless blood debts against the people of South Vietnam. On the first of this month, during a "mopping up" operation in Da Ngu village, Hoa Hiep commune, Tuy Hoa district, Phu Yen province, they barbarously massacred 42 innocent residents, most of whom were elderly people and children. On December 21st of last year, the South Korean mercenary troops also collectively massacred 50 innocent residents in Tan Giang village, Tuy Phuoc district, Binh Dinh province.

    以刻骨的仇恨严惩凶恶的美帝帮凶
    南越平定省游击队痛歼南朝鲜军三百余
    新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，平定省游击队九日在反击南朝鲜帮凶军“扫荡”的战斗中，取得很大胜利，据初步消息，歼敌三百七十二人，击落敌人直升飞机两架。
    南朝鲜帮凶军最近出动六个营的兵力进行“扫荡”，屠杀南越人民。当地游击队怀着刻骨的仇恨，一月九日在仁丰、仁成和福兴等地猛烈袭击南朝鲜帮凶军，打死打伤很多敌人，为死难同胞报仇。剩下的敌军狼狈逃窜。
    南朝鲜帮凶军无恶不作，对越南南方人民犯下累累血债。本月一日，他们在向富安省绥和县和协乡多渔村进行“扫荡”时，野蛮地集体屠杀了四十二名无辜居民，其中绝大部分是老人和小孩。去年十二月二十一日，南朝鲜帮凶军还在平定省绥福县新江村集体屠杀了五十名无辜居民。
