　　Blood Debts Must Be Paid in Blood!
　　In the liberated areas of Gia Lai Province in South Vietnam, I had a conversation with the mother of Nap, a national hero of South Vietnam. The hero's mother was already over eighty years old, with white hair, a kind and gentle old woman. However, when we talked about the American aggressors, this kind old woman's eyes immediately flashed with hatred, and she said, almost trembling with emotion, "These robbers, how much suffering they have caused our people. This blood debt, it must be repaid!"
　　The old woman's voice was low; but every word was filled with immense power of infection. I understood: this very short passage from the old woman, was a burning fire of hatred erupting from the bottom of her heart. This fire of hatred for the American aggressors, burns not only in the old woman's heart, but also in the hearts of all the people of South Vietnam.
　　During this not short period of time, I traveled to many places in South Vietnam. I went to the water towns of the plains and the mountain villages of the highlands, and there was almost no place where I did not see the bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors. These robbers brutally slaughtered unarmed people and frantically destroyed peaceful villages. Some say that American imperialism is even more cruel and barbaric than the Hitler fascists and Japanese militarists, that they are dehumanized executioners, a pack of mad beasts. From what I have seen and heard, I can attest: these are irrefutable iron facts!
　　In a small village in Quang Nam Province, I heard about the following incident: During a "sweep," the American aggressors seized a young unarmed villager, insisted that he was a "Viet Cong" guerrilla, tied him to a tree, and pierced the young man's neck with a dagger, letting the blood flow into a pre-prepared basin. The American aggressors and their lackeys stood around, staring wide-eyed at the victim, and let out bestial laughter.
　　"Are these robbers even human!" an old woman in the village said indignantly. Yes, the American aggressors are beasts in human skin. Their savage crimes of killing for pleasure are truly endless. In South Vietnam, the American aggressors and their lackeys used all sorts of barbaric killing instruments, from the guillotine of the Middle Ages to the latest American-made electric torture devices. They used the most cruel methods of killing: disembowelment, heart extraction, eye gouging, tongue cutting, and even cutting pieces of meat from the victims' bodies, pouring gasoline on them, and then setting them on fire...
　　Even for women and children, these beasts are equally inhumane. Once, on the road, we met a middle-aged woman dressed in black clothing, her face gaunt, walking with a limp, her hands placed in front of her chest, trembling slightly. Local comrades told me that she was a female cadre from Quang Ngai Province. She told us about the atrocities of the American aggressors and their lackeys: "Once, the enemy arrested me, and after severe torture, they tied me to a pillar, tightly tied my two trouser legs with thin ropes, and put six poisonous snakes in from my waistband." Johnson vociferously proclaimed that the United States was practicing "humanitarianism" in South Vietnam, listen to this bloody accusation, America's "humanity" is such appalling brutality!
　　Not only that, the American aggressors also used weapons of mass destruction to destroy peaceful villages in South Vietnam in batches. They dropped hundreds of tons of bombs on peaceful villages in the liberated areas every day. At night, they bombarded the liberated areas from strongholds with long-range artillery. I have personally seen many villages, under the heavy bombardment of these beasts, houses collapsed, trees were burned, cattle died, crops withered, and the roads and fields were full of bomb craters. These villages were all peaceful villages; but the more peaceful the residents, the more vicious the American robbers were.
　　As American imperialism suffered increasingly heavy defeats on the South Vietnamese battlefield, it openly used chemical agents and poison gas as tools of slaughter. I personally saw American military aircraft spraying poison in the liberated areas: some American military aircraft that appeared to be ordinary transport planes hovered at low altitude, and suddenly a strange howl sounded, and a thick black smoke spewed from the tail of the plane, and a series of flaming, flashing poison bombs were fired from the cabin windows. Afterwards, I also saw that the trees and crops that had been attacked by chemical agents had withered and yellowed leaves. Some forests have become death zones. In the past, Hitler's fascists and Japanese militarists did not dare to openly use this kind of weapon, but today American imperialism actually uses it so blatantly! These are the most ferocious and brutal beasts in history!
　　The American aggressors are carrying out an out-and-out massacre and destruction in South Vietnam. They vainly attempt to intimidate the people of South Vietnam with the heinous means of "kill all, burn all, destroy all." Their calculation is completely wrong. The people of South Vietnam are heroic and stand tall. They have the determination and confidence to defeat the American aggressors. As a song says: "You reap what you sow, whoever sows hatred will suffer the consequences!" The bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors can only arouse stronger hatred and more resolute fighting determination among the people of South Vietnam. The hero's mother said it well: "This blood debt, it must be repaid!" The people of South Vietnam are using heroic battles to give the American aggressors redoubled blows, and American imperialism will surely be burned to ashes in the fire of hatred of the people of South Vietnam.

### 血债必须用血来还！

    血债必须用血来还！
    在越南南方嘉莱省的解放区里，我和越南南方民族英雄纳普的母亲谈过一次话。英雄的母亲已经八十多岁了，白发苍苍，是一位慈祥的老人。但是，当我们一谈到美国侵略者的时候，这位慈祥的老人马上两眼闪烁着仇恨的火光，激动得几乎是颤抖地说：“这些强盗，它们给我们人民制造了多少苦难啊。这笔血债，必须要偿还！”
    老人说话的声音是低沉的；但是每个字都充满着巨大的感染力量。我懂得：老人这十分简短的一段话，是从她心底里迸发出来的燃烧着的仇恨之火。这种对美国侵略者的仇恨之火，不仅在老人心里燃烧，也在所有越南南方人民的心里燃烧。
    在这段不短的时间里，我在越南南方走过了很多地方。我到过平原的水乡，也到过高原的山村，几乎没有一个地方看不到美国侵略者犯下的血腥罪行。这些强盗，残暴地屠杀手无寸铁的人民，疯狂地毁灭和平的村庄。有人说，美帝国主义是比希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义者还要残忍野蛮的匪徒，是灭绝人性的刽子手，是一群疯狂的野兽。我以所见所闻证明：这是千真万确的铁的事实！
    在广南省的一个小村头，我听到了这样一件事：美国侵略者在一次“扫荡”中抓了一个手无寸铁的青年村民，硬说他是“越共”游击队，就把他绑在树上，用匕首刺穿这个青年的脖子，让鲜血流进一个预先准备好的脸盆里。美国侵略者和它们的走狗就围在四周睁大眼睛望着这个受害的青年而发出兽性的狂笑。
    “这帮强盗还能说是人吗！”村里的一位老太太激愤地说。是的，美国侵略者是披着人皮的野兽。他们杀人作乐的野蛮罪行，真是无法说完的。在越南南方，美国侵略者和它们的走狗使用了各色各样野蛮的杀人刑具，从中世纪的铡头机到最新式的美制电刑刑具。它们使用了最残酷的杀人方法：剖腹、掏心肝、挖眼睛、割舌头，甚至从被害者身上把肉一块块割下来，往身上浇汽油，然后点火烧……。
    即使对于妇女和儿童，这些野兽也同样是惨无人道的。有一次，我们在路上遇到一个穿黑衣黑裤的中年妇女，她脸色削瘦，一步一拐，两手放在胸前微微颤抖。当地的同志告诉我，这是广义省的一位妇女干部。她向我们诉述了美国侵略者和它们的走狗的暴行：“有一次敌人把我逮捕了，在严刑拷打以后，还把我绑在柱子上，用细绳紧扎了我的两个裤管，从裤腰里放进六条毒蛇。”约翰逊口口声声宣扬美国在南越实行什么“人道主义”，听听这一段血淋淋的控诉吧，美国的“人道”就是这样令人发指的兽行！
    不仅如此，美国侵略者还利用大规模的杀人武器来毁灭越南南方成批成批的和平村庄。它们每天把成百吨的炸弹倾倒在解放区和平村庄里。而在夜间，它们又在据点里用远射程大炮向解放区乱轰。我曾亲眼见到不少村庄，在这些野兽的狂轰滥炸下，房屋倒塌了，树木烧毁了，耕牛倒毙了，庄稼枯萎了，道路田野到处弹坑累累。这些村庄，都是一些和平的村庄；但是美国强盗越是对和平居民，就越是这样的穷凶极恶。
    当美帝国主义在南越战场上遭到越来越惨重失败的时候，竟公然使用了化学毒剂和毒气来作为屠杀工具。我曾亲眼看到过美军飞机在解放区撒毒的情况：一些外形似乎是普通运输机的美国军用飞机，在低空盘旋，突然一声怪啸，机尾喷出一股浓浓的黑烟，机舱窗口也射出一串串着火闪光的毒药弹。事后，我又看到，那些受到化学毒剂侵袭的树木和庄稼，叶子枯黄脱落。有些森林整个成了死亡地带。过去希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义者还不敢公然使用这种武器，今天美帝国主义居然明目张胆地使用了！这些历史上最凶恶最残暴的野兽！
    美国侵略者在越南南方进行的是一场不折不扣的大屠杀，大破坏。它们妄想用“杀光、烧光、毁光”的罪恶手段就能够吓倒越南南方人民。他们的算盘完全打错了。越南南方人民是顶天立地的英雄，他们有决心也有信心打败美国侵略者。正如一首歌里所说的：“种瓜的得瓜，种豆的得豆，谁种下仇恨他自己遭殃！”美国侵略者犯下的血腥罪行，只能激起越南南方人民更强烈的仇恨和更坚决的战斗决心。英雄的母亲说得好：“这笔血债，必须要偿还！”越南南方人民正在用英勇的战斗给美国侵略者以加倍的打击，美帝国主义一定要在越南南方人民仇恨的烈火中被烧成灰烬。　　　本报记者　戴枫（附图片）
