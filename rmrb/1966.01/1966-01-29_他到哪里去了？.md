    Where Did He Go?
    Worker of Datong Coal Mine, Heishi
    The New Year's Eve party began. In just two more acts, it would be our workshop's turn to perform the chorus. However, in the blink of an eye, our chorus was missing someone, Little Liu was gone.
    Fortunately, it was a chorus, so missing one person didn't matter too much. After the party ended, I left the club and went straight to Little Liu's dorm. Upon entering, I saw a pile of Chairman Mao's works and technical books on his bunk, but no sign of him. Little Wang, his roommate, told me that he had just seen Little Liu leave with a drawing. Hearing this, I knew that Little Liu must have gone to the workshop to see his "thread-cutting machine" again.
    Little Liu's name is Liu Jian'an. Two months ago, he saw the comrades in the first group manually threading nuts. Upon asking, he learned that these were the main parts of the anchor bolts. Anchor bolts can replace wooden supports, save wood, are safer, and are easier to use. Large-scale production would begin in 1966. However, manually threading nuts was too laborious. Little Liu thought: If a thread-cutting machine could be made to replace manual operation, that would be great. So Little Liu started using his brain and studied with the workers. Sure enough, he soon created a homemade thread-cutting machine. After calculating, it was more than eight and a half times more efficient than manual labor. Except for the loud noise, there was nothing else to criticize.
    While thinking, I went straight to the assembly workshop. Pushing open the workshop door, it was quiet inside, with only one electric light on. Suddenly, a slight "ding ding" sound came from the left corner. I rushed over to take a look, and it was Little Liu working on that "new machine." I pretended to be angry and walked up to him, saying, "Little Liu, what's the point of working on something that's already successful? Everyone is waiting for the performance, but you...".
      "Master Chen, look, there are still problems. How can you say it's successful?" Little Liu said, widening his eyes.
    "The problems can be solved later."
    "The loud noise means there's a problem with the force. If it's used for a long time, some parts will wear out prematurely."
    "The problems in this machine are so complicated, how can they be solved all at once? It's getting late, let's go back and rest!"
    "No, Master Chen, next year is 1966, the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, a new battle! Chairman Mao taught us to fight prepared battles, didn't he? If the battle preparations are not done well, how can we fight this battle?" He touched the thread-cutting machine with his hand, smiled slightly, and continued, "In any case, I must fix it before the New Year!"
    The words were few, but every sentence struck my heart. I blurted out, "Okay, let's finish it together before we leave!"
    Under the bright light, we stood shoulder to shoulder, preparing new "weapons" for the new battle.

    他到哪里去了？
    大同煤矿工人　黑石
    迎新晚会开始了。再过两个节目，就要轮到我们车间演出大合唱了。可是，一眨眼，我们的合唱队却少了一个人，小刘不见了。
    好在这是合唱，少一个人关系也不大。散会以后，我出了俱乐部，直奔小刘宿舍，一进门，只见他的铺位上，堆放着一堆毛主席著作和技术书，却不见人影。同屋的小王告我说，刚才见小刘拿着一张图纸出去了。我一听，便知道小刘准是又到车间去看他的“绞丝机”去了。
    小刘叫刘建安，两个月前，他看见第一组的同志们用手工绞螺丝帽，一问，才知道这是锚栓杆的主要零件。锚栓杆能代替木头支柱，省木材，又安全，用起来又轻便。一九六六年将大批生产。但是用手工绞螺丝帽太费力了，小刘心想：如果能制造一个绞丝机来代替人工操作，那该多好。于是小刘便动开了脑子和工人们一起研究，果然不久就搞出了一台土绞丝机。算了一下，比人工提高效率八倍半多。除去响声大些，别的没有可挑剔的。
    我一边想一边直奔装配车间。推开车间门，里边静悄悄的，只亮着一盏电灯。突然，靠左边的角落里响起轻微的“叮叮”声。我奔过去一瞧，正是小刘在搞那台“新机器”。我装着生气地走到他跟前，说：“小刘，成功了的东西还有啥搞头，大家都等着演出哪，可你……”。
      “陈师傅，你瞧，还有毛病哪，怎么说成功了啊。”小刘睁大眼睛说。
    “有毛病以后再解决嘛。”
    “响声大说明有别劲儿的地方。用的时间一长，有些零件就会提前磨坏啦。”
    “这机器里的问题这么复杂，一下怎么能解决呢？天不早了，还是先回去休息吧！”
    “不，陈师傅，明年是一九六六年啦，是第三个五年计划的头一年，是新的战斗啦，毛主席不是教导咱，要打有准备的仗吗？战斗准备没做好，这仗可咋个打法？”他用手摸了摸绞丝机，微微一笑，接着说下去，“无论如何，我一定要在新年前把它搞好才行！”
    话儿不多，可句句打在了我的心上，我顺口说：“好，咱一起搞完再走！”
    在明亮的灯光下，我们肩并着肩，为新的战斗准备着新的“武器”。
