    Revolutionary Content, Brilliant Sculptures
    ——On the Achievements of "Rent Collection Courtyard"
    Liu Kaiqu
    The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture group, with its realistic, profound, and vivid artistic images, exposes the landlord class's persecution of peasants in the old society, providing a profound class education.
    Seeing the young sculptors of Sichuan wholeheartedly dedicated to the revolution, daring to think and act, and creating outstanding achievements, my heart is greatly encouraged. In just fifteen or sixteen years since liberation, a large number of young sculptors have grown up, creating new sculptures welcomed by the broad masses. This is the result of the great Mao Zedong Thought education; the result of the Party's leadership and cultivation; this is a victory for the socialist cultural revolution serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving the socialist revolution, and facing the countryside.
    The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture group, based on the historical facts of the cruel exploitation of peasants by the tyrannical landlord Liu Wencai, centrally expresses the sharp struggle between peasants and landlords, depicts the tragic experiences of peasants being squeezed by landlords to the point of families being torn apart and destroyed, exposes the crimes of the landlord class, and also expresses the peasants' spirit of not yielding and wanting to fight the landlords. The old woman forced to pay rent, the young girl waiting to have her rent verified, both look at the landlord and his lackeys with angry eyes; many young adults, such as the peasants holding carrying poles and iron axes, and the young man whose house is being ransacked, they are not afraid of the landlord's beatings, not afraid of the landlord's imprisonment, and are furiously determined to fight the enemy. The final group of figures, peasants banding together to go to struggle, further strengthens the theme of the group sculpture. The group sculpture educates the audience that we must not forget class hatred, we must not forget class struggle; only by carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end will the laboring people achieve final victory.
    The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture uses the form of a group sculpture, but each group, each section of the subject matter, each character, has different plot content. The conception and sculpted images are very complete. Even if existing separately, there is no feeling of being fragmented or incomplete. In "Forced to Pay Rent," the "family of four across three generations," the actions and thoughts of the men, women, old and young, are concentrated amidst complexity, and the composition is complete. In "Selling Granddaughter to Repay Debt," the crying granddaughter, holding the hand of her blind grandfather, holds her contract of sale in that hand. The audience cannot help but feel sorrow when they see this image. Similarly, the "Grandmother and Grandson" two-person sculpture has small actions, but detailed psychological portrayal, and is extremely infectious. The "Widow dragging children" and the "Young woman forcibly taken to be a wet nurse" two groups of sculptures strongly expose the landlord's cruel atrocities, leaving a deep impression on the audience.
    The group sculpture creation critically draws on the experience of predecessors, especially Chinese folk sculpture art, adopting a complete plot with a beginning and end, continuous composition, and clear and definite styling treatment. This is the result of following Chairman Mao's instructions to make the past serve the present, and weed through the old to bring forth the new. This is a new development and a new creation in sculpture art. Ancient temples, grottoes, and tombs have produced a large number of sculptures. Ancient sculptors achieved high artistic achievements in production techniques, organizing subject matter content, and styling treatment, but the subject matter was mostly feudal superstition, emperors, kings and generals. Even when there are images of the laboring people, they are often distorted. The scope of subject matter in Western sculpture is similarly narrow. Modern bourgeois sculpture art thinking and habits, emphasizing form and deemphasizing content, using the name of sculptural characteristics to disregard the reality of life; only valuing personal style and taste, disregarding the appreciation habits of the masses, are often said to be the characteristics of sculpture. In fact, the main characteristic of sculpture as an art form is to use three-dimensional art forms to express subject matter content, allowing the audience to feel and understand the theme, thoughts, and feelings that the author wants to express through three-dimensional modeling. The views and aesthetic standards of the feudal and bourgeois classes on sculpture are not good things, but rather obstacles that prevent us from creating revolutionized, militant, and mass-oriented sculpture. These constraints have hampered many of our sculptors, especially older generations like myself, who have not reformed their thinking well, and have failed to work in accordance with Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought in our creative and teaching work.
    The young sculptors of Sichuan, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following the Party's literary and artistic policy, unconstrained by old frameworks, boldly breaking the old artistic thinking frameworks, going deep into life, using the viewpoint of class and class struggle, with abundant revolutionary enthusiasm, have sculpted works that are rich in class education significance and inspire the people. This is an unprecedented achievement in the group sculpture creation in the history of sculpture.
    The Sichuan sculptors collectively created "Rent Collection Courtyard" under the ideological guidance of "wanting the Party's cause, wanting collectivist concepts, not wanting personal distractions." Everyone made suggestions for each sculpture, and under unified leadership, the group sculpture had a unified artistic style, yet each was distinct. Generally speaking, in order to achieve a unified overall atmosphere in group sculpture, harmony without chaos, it is often necessary to reduce the individuality of each sculpture; achieving a full character for each sculpture easily weakens the overall sense of the group sculpture. Achieving both is very difficult. In the past, there was also collective creation in the sculpture world, but it was mostly individual work within the collective, and there was no good way to listen to the opinions of the masses. The "Rent Collection Courtyard" group sculpture has a large composition scale, many characters, numerous accessories, and a short sculpting time, but it was completed successfully. This shows that in sculpture creation, cooperation with socialist collectivist thought can enable the work to achieve newer and more beautiful achievements.
    This creative experience has opened up a new path for the sculpture world. It not only enables sculpture art to face the broad countryside and serve the peasants; it also adds a new method to urban sculpture. It enables sculpture to better serve the socialist revolution. On the basis of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, sculpture and painting can cooperate to vigorously promote socialist revolution and socialist construction in our rural areas and cities; vigorously promote communist ideology; vigorously praise the laboring people's achievements in transforming the world, and open up revolutionary art flowers.
    The main reason for the great success of the "Rent Collection Courtyard" group sculpture is that the Sichuan sculptors have always strived to study Chairman Mao's works, put politics in command, and wholeheartedly listen to the Party's words, going deep into life. In the creative process, the Party committee pointed out the direction, encouraged enthusiasm, and peasants and other masses came to the site to offer opinions, greatly improving the creation, making the work more revolutionary, more militant, more popular with the masses, and more inspiring.
    In order to push sculpture art to higher achievements, we sculptors must better learn Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply it creatively, go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and constantly transform our world outlook; learn and promote the valuable experience of the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture group, so that sculpture art can better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and serve the world revolution.

    革命的内容，光辉的群象
    ——谈《收租院》的成就
    刘开渠
    《收租院》泥塑群象，以真实、深刻、生动的艺术形象，揭露了旧社会地主阶级对农民的迫害，使人受到深刻的阶级教育。
    看见四川青年雕塑工作者一心为革命，敢想敢干，创造了优秀的成绩，心中非常振奋。解放后，仅仅十五六年，大批青年雕塑工作者成长起来，创作出受到广大群众欢迎的新雕塑品，这是伟大的毛泽东思想教育的结果；是党的领导、培养的结果，这是为工农兵服务、为社会主义革命服务、面向农村的社会主义文化革命的胜利。
    《收租院》泥塑群象，根据恶霸地主刘文彩对农民残酷剥削的史实，集中表现了农民与地主的尖锐斗争，刻划了农民被地主压榨得骨肉分离、家破人亡的悲惨遭遇，揭露了地主阶级的罪恶，同时也表现了农民不甘屈服，要与地主斗争的精神。被迫交租的老大娘，等候验租过斗的青年姑娘，都以愤怒的眼光，看着地主和狗腿子；许多青壮年，如持扁担和拿铁斧的农民，被抄家的青年等，他们不怕地主吊打、不怕地主关牢，怒不可遏地要与敌人拼命。最后一组人物是农民结队走向斗争，就更加强了群象的主题思想。群象教育了观众，不能忘记阶级仇，不能忘记阶级斗争；只有将无产阶级革命进行到底，才是劳动人民最后的胜利。
    《收租院》泥塑用的是群象形式，而每一组、每一段的题材，每一个人物，又有不同的情节内容。构思和塑造的形象都很完整。即使分别独立存在，也没有片段不全的感觉。“被迫交租”中的“一家三代四口”，男女老少人物的动作和思想感情，在复杂中有集中，构图组织完整。“卖孙还债”中哭着的孙女，牵着瞎了眼的老祖父的手，就在这只手上，拿着她的卖身契，观众看了这个形象，无不心酸。又如“婆孙”这座二人象，人物动作不大，但心理刻划细致，感染力极强。“拖儿带女的寡妇”，“被强拉去做奶妈的青年妇女”两组群象，都强烈地揭露了地主的残酷暴行，给观众极深的印象。
    群象创作批判地借鉴了前人、尤其是中国民间雕塑艺术的经验，采用有始有终的情节，连续的构图，造型处理交代清楚、明确。这是遵照毛主席古为今用，推陈出新的指示的结果，这是雕塑艺术的新发展，新创造。古代的庙宇、石窟及陵墓等处，曾做了大批的雕塑品。古代雕塑家在制作技术，组织题材内容，造型处理上，当时达到了很高的艺术成就，但题材绝大部分是封建迷信，帝王将相。即使有劳动人民的形象，也常是被歪曲了的。西洋雕塑的题材内容范围，同样是十分窄狭。近代资产阶级的雕塑艺术思想及习惯，重形式轻内容，借雕塑特性之名，轻视生活真实；只重个人风格趣味，不顾群众的欣赏习惯等，常被说成是雕塑的特点。其实，就雕塑这门艺术本身来说，它的主要特点，是利用立体艺术形式，表现题材内容，让观众通过立体造型，感受、领会到作者所要表达的主题思想感情。封建阶级、资产阶级，对雕塑的观点，欣赏标准，不是什么好东西，而是阻碍我们去创造革命化、战斗化、群众化雕塑的条条框框。这些条条框框，曾束缚了我们不少雕塑工作者，尤其是象我这样老一辈的人，思想未改造好，在创作和教学工作上，都未能做到按照毛主席的文艺思想去进行工作。
    四川青年雕塑工作者，高举伟大的毛泽东思想红旗，遵照党的文艺方针，不受旧框框的束缚，大胆地打破旧艺术思想的框框，深入生活，以阶级和阶级斗争的观点，以充沛的革命热情，塑造出富有阶级教育意义、鼓舞人心的作品。这在雕塑史的群象创作上，是空前的成就。
    四川雕塑工作者，是在“要党的事业，要集体观念，不要个人杂念”的思想指导下，集体进行《收租院》创作的。每个人都对每个塑象出主意，在统一领导下，使群象既有统一的艺术风格，而又各有区别。一般来说，群象形式为了做到整体气氛统一，调和不乱，常常就会不得不减少每个象的区别性；做到了每个象的性格丰满，又容易减弱群象的整体感。要作到兼而有之，是很不易的。雕塑界在过去也有过集体创作，但多是集体中的个人独作，也没能很好地听取群众意见。《收租院》群象，构图规模大，人物多，附件繁，塑造的时间短，但却胜利地完成了。这说明在雕塑创作上，以社会主义集体思想去合作，就能使作品获得更新更美的成就。
    这次创作经验，为雕塑界开辟了新道路。不仅使雕塑艺术能够面向广大的农村，为农民服务；同时也给城市雕塑增加了一种新办法。使雕塑可以更好地为社会主义革命服务。在推陈出新的基础上，雕塑绘画配合起来，在我们的农村和城市，大力宣传社会主义革命和社会主义建设；大力宣传共产主义思想；大力歌颂劳动人民改天换地之功，大开革命艺术之花。
    《收租院》群象，能有如此大的成功，最主要的是四川雕塑工作者，一向努力学习毛主席著作，政治挂帅，一心一意听党的话，深入生活的结果。在创作过程中，党委指方向，鼓干劲，农民与其他群众到现场提意见，使创作得到很大的提高，使作品更富有革命性，更富有战斗性，更为群众喜爱，更能感染人。
    为了把雕塑艺术推向更高的成就，我们雕塑工作者要更好地把毛泽东思想学到手，活学活用，深入工农兵生活，不断地改造我们的世界观；学习和推广《收租院》泥塑群象的宝贵经验，让雕塑艺术更好地为工农兵服务，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为世界革命服务。
