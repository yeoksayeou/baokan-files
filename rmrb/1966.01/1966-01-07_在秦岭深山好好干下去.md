    Originally, none of us planned to work in this deep mountainous area for a lifetime. However, the long-term instability in production prompted us to consider: How can we be considered true communists if things continue this way?
    Liangdang County is located in the Qinling Mountains, with vast mountains and deep gullies, scattered residences, and significant regional differences. Good weather can lead to increased production, while bad weather results in decreased production. There was an increase of several million catties in 1963, but a decrease of several million catties in 1964, with output fluctuating up and down. The county party committee began to realize two years ago that this was a serious problem. How can we be considered thorough revolutionaries and continuous revolutionaries if things continue this way? How can we be considered true communists?
    In order to understand the crux of this problem, the county party committee adopted three measures: First, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" with the problem in mind, and conducted self-examination in light of our own ideological realities. Second, the county party committee secretary and county head went to the countryside to stay and work, exploring the laws with grassroots cadres and farmers, identifying gaps, studying measures to increase production, and creating models. Third, we specifically convened two enlarged county party committee meetings and one county-level three-level cadre meeting to uncover problems and find the root causes.
    Through these measures and more than a year of practice, we found several reasons: First, the world outlook of serving the revolution wholeheartedly had not been fully established by the main leading members of the county party committee (mainly ourselves). We lacked the ambition to build the Liangdang mountain area. We were afraid of hardship in our thinking, believing that the mountains were vast and the gullies deep, transportation was inconvenient, life was difficult, and there were many endemic diseases. No one planned to work here for a lifetime. Therefore, we stayed in the offices, relaying reports upwards and downwards, becoming "transfer stations" and "megaphones."
    Second, the county party committee was satisfied with the status quo, saying that the total output had exceeded 20 million catties, and the lives of the masses were quite good. They had enough to eat and places to put things. They were better than the bottom but not as good as the top. They were unwilling to learn from the strengths of others, and were accustomed to the thin and barren land, rough cultivation, inconvenient transportation, and endemic diseases. They had no determination to transform natural conditions.
    Third, the county party committee leaders often only emphasized the negative aspects of natural conditions, neglecting the primary role of human factors. They failed to see the strong desire of the poor and lower-middle peasants to build a new socialist countryside, and did not mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses to transform unfavorable conditions and change backward habits. In this way, the instructions of the higher-level party committee and the demands of the broad masses of cadres and people were blocked by the backward thinking of the county party committee.
    All of these problems ultimately come down to the question of whom we are serving. After finding the root cause and unifying our understanding, we were determined to achieve revolutionization. Last winter, we built more than 1,000 mu of level terraces and vigorously grasped the three key factors for increasing production: soil preparation, fertilizer accumulation, and improved varieties. Last year, the county's grain production increased substantially. The enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses was even greater. The Xiangquan Canal, which had not been completed for more than ten years, was completed in less than a month; the Zhanyuan Highway, which had not been completed for three years, will soon be fully open to traffic. The facts eloquently demonstrate that the mental state of the county party committee leadership plays a decisive role in the quality of work in a county. Therefore, the revolutionization of the county party committee cannot be an empty slogan; instead, it must take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide and adopt large-scale inspections, large-scale summaries, and large-scale evaluations to identify gaps. Only in this way can the revolutionization of the county party committee leadership be put into action and implemented in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    在秦岭深山好好干下去
    原来谁也没有打算在这深山区干一辈子。但是，生产长期不稳定的状况，促使我们考虑：这样下去怎么能算真正的共产党人呢？
    两当县地处秦岭山区，山大沟深，居住分散，地区差异性大，天时好就能增产，天时不好就要减产，一九六三年增产了几百万斤，一九六四年减产几百万斤，产量时高时低。县委前年开始认识到这是一个严重问题，老是这样下去怎么能算是彻底革命和不断革命者呢？怎么能算真正的共产党人呢？
    为了弄清这个问题的症结，县委采取了三项措施：一是带着问题反复学习毛主席著作《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等文章，联系思想实际进行检查。二是县委书记、县长下乡蹲点，和基层干部、农民群众一起摸索规律，找差距，研究增产措施，搞样板。三是专门召开了两次县委扩大会议和一次县的三级干部会议，揭盖子，找根源。
    通过这些措施和一年多的实践，找到了几个原因：一、县委主要领导成员（主要是我们自己）一心为革命的世界观没有完全树立起来，没有建设两当山区的雄心壮志，思想上怕苦，认为山大沟深，交通不便，生活艰苦，地方病多，谁也不打算在这里干一辈子。所以就蹲在机关里上报下达，成了“转运站”“传话筒”。
    二、县委满足现状，说什么总产上了两千万，群众生活就满不错了，吃有吃的，放有放的，比上不足比下有余，不愿学习别人的长处，对土地瘦薄，粗耕粗种，交通不便，地方病多习以为常，没有决心去改造自然条件。
    三、县委领导上往往只强调自然条件不好的一面，忽视人的因素第一，看不到贫下中农有建设社会主义新农村的强烈要求，不去调动广大干部群众的积极性，改造不利条件，改变落后的习惯势力。这样上级党委的指示、广大干部和人民群众的要求被县委的落后思想隔住了。
    这些归根结底是为谁服务的问题没有解决。找到了根源，统一了认识，我们下定决心实现革命化，前年冬天修了一千多亩水平梯田，狠抓了整地、积肥、良种三大增产关键，去年全县粮食大幅度增产。干部群众干劲更足了，十多年未修通的香泉渠，不到一个月就修通了；三年未修通的站元公路，即可全线通车。事实雄辩说明：县委领导的精神状态怎么样，对一个县工作的好坏起着决定性的作用。因此，县委革命化不能在口头上空喊，而是要以毛泽东思想为指针，采取大检查，大总结，大评比，找差距。只有这样，县委领导的革命化才能落实到行动上，落实到社会主义革命和社会主义建设中去。
