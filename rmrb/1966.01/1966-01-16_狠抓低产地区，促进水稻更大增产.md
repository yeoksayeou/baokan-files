    Rice production occupies an extremely important position in China's grain production. Striving for continuous growth in rice production is an important task in our national economic construction.
    Since 1962, rice production has achieved bumper harvests for four consecutive years. The amount of rice increased each year accounts for about 60 percent of the total increase in grain production nationwide each year. At present, the main problem in China's rice production is uneven and unstable development. In general, the area of stable and high yield is small, while the area of unstable or not high, and stable but not high is large. According to statistics from the thirteen major rice-producing provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in southern China, paddy fields with per-mu yields approaching, reaching, or exceeding the targets of the "National Agricultural Development Program" account for about one-quarter of the total paddy field area. The remaining three-quarters of the paddy fields still have unstable or not high yields, or stable but not high yields. At the same time, the increase in early rice production in recent years has been relatively large, while the increase in middle and late rice production has been relatively small. This unbalanced and unstable situation indicates that China's potential for increasing rice production is still very large.
    Our main tasks in the future are to continue to do a good job in high-yield areas, while firmly grasping low-yield areas, and to continue to do a good job in early rice, while firmly grasping middle and late rice. In this way, it is entirely possible to strive for a more comprehensive and greater increase in rice production during the Third Five-Year Plan period.
    Most of China's low-yield rice areas are hilly and mountainous areas. In the past, the relevant leading departments did not regard these areas as key targets, so the production conditions are still relatively poor, the cultivation is still relatively extensive, and the production outlook is changing relatively slowly. In fact, the potential for increasing production in low-yield areas is much greater than that in high-yield areas. As long as the work keeps up, it is entirely possible to rapidly increase yields. Party committees and governments at all levels should continue to do a good job in high-yield areas, while using greater strength to grasp low-yield areas, especially areas with high grain commodity rates, and strive to make relatively significant changes in the rice production outlook of these areas during the Third Five-Year Plan period.
    Can the rice production outlook of low-yield areas be changed in a relatively short period of time? The key lies in whether the leadership grasps tightly and whether the work is appropriate. Strengthening the work in low-yield rice areas is a work with great economic and political significance, and it must be placed on the important agenda. We must be determined to transfer a group of young and promising backbone members to strengthen and enrich the leadership of counties and communes in these areas. Leading cadres must personally go to these areas to stay and work, take the lead at critical moments, and set an example. We must educate the broad masses of cadres to be unafraid of hardship and difficulties, and actively go there to take on the task of changing the production outlook of these areas as a glorious revolutionary task. We must organize relevant departments to strengthen support for these areas. Agricultural funds and materials should be invested more in these areas; agricultural scientific and technical personnel should go there more to set up "three-way combination" demonstration fields to help these areas improve their production technology; industrial and transportation, financial and trade, cultural and educational, and health departments should better serve these areas; and urban educated youth should be mobilized to go to the mountains and the countryside, mainly to settle in these areas and participate in mountainous area construction.
    Strengthening the leadership and support for low-yield areas does not mean that the state will take over everything. The change in the rice production outlook of low-yield areas, in the final analysis, still requires promoting the Dazhai spirit, relying on the local peasant masses, relying on the strength of the collective economy, striving for self-improvement, self-reliance, hard work, diligence and frugality, starting from scratch, working hard for three, five, eight, or even longer years, to carry out a struggle to change the world. The leadership in these areas should first be political and ideological leadership; the assistance to these areas should first be political and ideological assistance. We must educate the cadres and commune members in these areas to establish the idea of farming for the revolution, to "have the motherland in mind and the world in view," to adhere to the socialist orientation, to boost revolutionary enthusiasm, to learn from advanced experience, to work diligently, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, and to create a socialist cause together.
    In addition to rice, agricultural production in rice-growing areas also includes other grain production such as wheat, corn, potatoes, and beans. In many places, the planting area of these grain crops is quite large, and in some cases accounts for more than half of the grain sown area. In many hilly and mountainous areas, corn, potatoes, and other crops are still the staple food of the peasants. Many of China's rice-producing areas are also important economic crop-producing areas for timber, bamboo, tea, silkworms, sugar crops, tobacco, and medicinal materials; especially hilly and mountainous areas, with abundant natural resources, have many avenues for production that can be opened up. Therefore, while grasping rice production, the Party committees and governments of rice-producing areas must also grasp other grain production, grasp diversified operations, and correctly implement the policy of taking grain as the key link, developing diversified operations, and promoting comprehensive development, in accordance with local conditions. Only in this way can we further increase the income of the peasant masses and improve the lives of the peasant masses; expand the accumulation of collective funds, increase livestock power, expand fertilizer sources, create conditions for further increases in grain production, and strive to build these areas into not only important granaries of our country, but also important industrial raw material bases, and make greater and greater contributions to socialist construction.

### 狠抓低产地区，促进水稻更大增产

    狠抓低产地区，促进水稻更大增产
    水稻生产在我国粮食生产中占有极其重要的地位。力争水稻生产的持续增长，是我国国民经济建设中的一项重要任务。
    一九六二年以来，水稻生产连续四年获得丰收。每年增产的稻谷数量，约占全国每年粮食增产总量的百分之六十左右。当前，我国水稻生产的主要问题是发展不平衡、不稳定。总的来说，稳产高产的面积小，不稳不高和稳而不高的面积大。据我国主要水稻产区的南方十三个省、市、区的统计，亩产量接近、达到或超过“全国农业发展纲要”指标的基本稳产和比较高产的稻田，约占全部稻田面积的四分之一，其余四分之三的稻田，产量仍然不稳不高或稳而不高。同时，这几年早稻增产的幅度较大，而中稻和晚稻增产的幅度较小。这种不平衡、不稳定的状况，说明了我国水稻的增产潜力还很大。
    我们今后的主要任务，是在继续抓好高产地区的同时，狠抓低产地区，在继续抓好早稻的同时，狠抓中稻和晚稻。这样，争取在第三个五年计划期间，使水稻生产出现一个更全面的更大幅度的增产局面，是完全可能的。
    我国水稻低产地区，大多是丘陵山区。对这类地区，过去有关领导方面没有当作重点来抓，因此，生产条件仍然比较差，耕作仍然比较粗放，生产面貌改变比较慢。其实，低产地区的增产潜力，比高产地区大得多，只要工作跟上去，完全能够迅速提高产量。各地党委和政府，要在继续抓好高产地区的同时，以更大的力量抓好低产地区，特别是粮食商品率高的地区，争取在第三个五年计划期间，使这些地区的水稻生产面貌有比较显著的改变。
    低产地区的水稻生产面貌，能不能在比较短的时间内得到改变呢？关键在于领导是否抓得紧，工作是否得法。加强水稻低产地区的工作，是一项具有巨大经济意义和政治意义的工作，必须把它摆到重要的议事日程上来。要下决心抽调一批年青有为的骨干，加强和充实这些地区县、社的领导力量。领导干部要亲自到这些地区去蹲点，在关键时刻走在前头，作出表率。要教育广大干部，不怕艰苦，不怕困难，踊跃地到那里去，把改变这些地区的生产面貌，作为一项光荣的革命任务担当起来。要组织有关部门加强对这些地区的支援。农业的资金和物资，应该较多地投放到这些地区；农业科学技术人员，要更多地到那里去办“三结合”的样板田，帮助这些地区提高生产技术水平；工交、财贸、文教、卫生等部门，要更好地为这些地区服务；城市动员知识青年上山下乡，应当主要到这些地区去安家落户，参加山区建设。
    加强对低产地区的领导和支援，决不意味着由国家包办代替。低产地区水稻生产面貌的改变，归根到底，还是要发扬大寨精神，依靠当地的农民群众，依靠集体经济的力量，奋发图强，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭创业，苦干三年、五年、十年、八年，以至更长的时间，进行改天换地的斗争。对这些地区的领导，首先应该是政治思想的领导；对这些地区的帮助，首先应该是政治思想的帮助。要教育这些地区的干部和社员群众，树立为革命种田的思想，“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”，坚持社会主义方向，大鼓革命干劲，学习先进经验，穷干、苦干、实干、巧干，创造社会主义大家业。
    水稻地区的农业生产，除了水稻以外，还有小麦、玉米、薯类、豆类等其它粮食生产。不少地方，这些粮食作物的种植面积相当大，有的占粮食播种面积的一半以上。在许多丘陵山区，玉米、薯类等还是农民的主粮。我国的许多水稻产区，又是木材、竹子、茶叶、桑蚕、糖料、烟叶、药材等重要经济作物产区；特别是丘陵山区，自然资源十分丰富，能够开辟的生产门路很多。因此，水稻产区的党委和政府，在抓好水稻生产的同时，还要抓好其它粮食生产，抓好多种经营，因地制宜地正确贯彻执行以粮为纲、多种经营、全面发展的方针。只有这样，才能进一步增加农民群众的收入，改善农民群众的生活；扩大集体资金的积累，增加畜力，扩大肥源，为粮食进一步增产创造条件，争取较快地把这些地区建设成为既是我们国家的重要粮仓，又是重要的工业原料基地，为社会主义建设做出越来越大的贡献。
