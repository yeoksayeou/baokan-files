    Ten Thousand Miles Across the Grassland
    Some time ago, comrades who participated in the Inner Mongolia grassland work conference conducted an 18,000-li (approximately 9,000 km) inspection of various types of grasslands in the autonomous region.
    Through on-site visits and discussions, people's minds were greatly liberated. The vivid examples and innovative spirit of herdsmen engaging in construction on various types of grasslands provided visitors with an extremely profound education, and many difficult questions were answered correctly.

    Arid and Water-Deficient Grasslands Can Be Changed
    Arid and water-deficient grasslands account for about 19 percent of the pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia. Can water be found in arid and water-deficient grasslands, and can their arid and water-deficient appearance be changed? Visits and inspections have shown that so-called arid and water-deficient grasslands are not without water, but simply have low rainfall and lack surface water such as rivers and lakes. Groundwater is often abundant, but the water table is somewhat deep. Many arid and water-deficient grasslands, as long as water sources are developed, are good pastures with water and grass and can become good places for developing livestock.

    Alxa Left Banner is a well-known water-deficient area in the autonomous region. There are no rivers within the banner, only some small streams and springs along the foot of the Helan Mountains. Everyone visited a pipeline water diversion project in Zongbie Li Commune of this banner, which gathers mountain spring water and uses underground pipelines as long as forty-odd *hua li* (approx. 20 km) to transport water in all directions, opening up and improving 300 square kilometers of pasture, solving the drinking water problem for 20,000 head (or numbers of sheep) of livestock in summer and autumn, and irrigating part of the feed base. Everyone saw lush trees surrounding the dams that retain the spring water, and dense pastures. Next to the drinking troughs, everyone was excited to see that when the reservoir released water, the long drinking troughs quickly filled with sparkling clear water, and livestock could drink their fill at any time.

    Neighboring communes and teams of Zongbie Li Commune also have two pipeline water diversion projects under construction. This is because the herdsmen have seen the benefits of pipeline water diversion projects with their own eyes and have automatically raised funds to build them. At the construction site, young herdsmen of all ethnic groups were busy making cement pipes, pushing earth with carts, and using stone tampers to compact the dam foundation.

    Visitors commented that while drilling wells in some pastoral areas is certainly necessary, underground pipelines have many advantages over wells: they use local materials, are easy to construct, can be managed by the masses themselves, are easy to manage, have low management costs, and have a long service life.

    Since 1958, Alxa Left Banner has made great progress in water conservancy construction in pastoral areas. The banner has drilled more than 2,200 new wells, dug 380 springs, and built some pipeline water diversion projects and some medium and small-sized reservoirs, ponds, and flood-drought dams. The use of these water conservancy projects has opened up 8,900 square kilometers of water-deficient grasslands, solved the drinking water problem for 456,000 head (or numbers of sheep) of livestock, and played an extremely important role in the development of animal husbandry in the banner.

    The impression of Alxa Left Banner is very profound. The natural conditions of this banner are very poor, but the herdsmen have a great revolutionary spirit and are full of vigor, making outstanding achievements in water conservancy construction. Comrades from Hulunbuir League said that Alxa Left Banner seeks water where there is no water and cherishes water like oil; our league has two large lakes, more than a dozen large rivers, and countless springs, but we do not make sufficient use of them, and much water is wasted. The groundwater level in our area is shallow, making it easy to drill wells, but there are not many wells. We must learn from Alxa Left Banner in the future.

    Tend to High-Quality Pasture Like Tending to Crops
    Grass is the "grain" of livestock. Artificially planting stable-yielding and high-yielding high-quality pasture is an important condition for ensuring stable-yielding and high-yielding animal husbandry. In recent years, Inner Mongolia has planted a total of 1.2 million *mu* (approx. 80,000 hectares) of high-quality pasture; the vast majority of places have been successful in planting grass, while some individual places have not been successful. The Xingfu Zhi Lu (Road to Happiness) Commune in Bairin Right Banner and the Zhurih Hot Forage Seed Breeding Farm in Sunit Right Banner, which everyone visited, are vivid contrasts between different practices and different results in the artificial planting of high-quality pasture.

    Upon arriving at the feed and forage base of the Xingfu Zhi Lu Commune, everyone was attracted by the moving scene here. More than 5,500 *mu* (approx. 367 hectares) of artificially planted high-quality pasture—alfalfa—stood two *chi* (approx. 66 cm) tall, a vast expanse of green. The Ao'er Gai River was continuously irrigating the alfalfa fields. Some herdsmen were loosening the soil in the alfalfa fields to enhance the pasture's drought resistance; some herdsmen were cultivating and earthing up to make the pasture roots more secure; and some herdsmen were carefully replanting grass seeds in areas with missing seedlings. They tend to high-quality pasture like they tend to crops. No wonder this artificially planted alfalfa grows so vigorously and pleasingly.

    The Zhurih Hot Forage Seed Breeding Farm, however, is a completely different story. Some alfalfa also grows here, but it is uneven in height, with broken rows and missing seedlings, overgrown with weeds, which grow even taller than the alfalfa. Everywhere shows that the high-quality pasture here is basically in a state of neglect.

    Planting grass on the great grasslands was unimaginable before liberation and had not been done by predecessors. Why do the herdsmen of the Xingfu Zhi Lu Commune attach so much importance to planting high-quality pasture? The reason is simple. The year before last, they planted more than 800 *mu* (approx. 53 hectares) of alfalfa. After meticulous field management, they harvested hundreds of thousands of *jin* (tens of tons) of high-quality pasture in the autumn, raising a large number of old and weak livestock well. The herdsmen said, "Alfalfa is truly a treasure; livestock love to eat it and it fattens them up." Because the herdsmen recognize the role of planting high-quality pasture, they do this work seriously. Last year, they expanded the planting area of alfalfa by nearly six times.

    Pastoral Machinery Has Great Potential
    In the Ewenki Autonomous Banner, where rivers crisscross and the grass is as green as a carpet, there is a Xibo Production Team of the Xini River West Commune.

    In this production team, everyone saw the seeds of socialist modernization of animal husbandry, and various types of pastoral machinery reformed and manufactured by the herdsmen: earth-drilling machines for winter construction of sheds, semi-automatic manure-dumping vehicles, mud-scooping devices for wells, wooden grass-gathering devices, conversion of horse-drawn mowing machines to tractor-drawn ones, and the installation of hay rakes on tractor-drawn mowing machines, etc.

    In the process of reforming tools and promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, the skilled craftsmen of this team closely integrated with production, manufacturing and reforming whatever production urgently needed. Because they adopted mechanized and semi-mechanized haymaking, the hay stored was surplus year after year, achieving a combination of grazing and stall feeding, which played a major role in promoting the stable, high-quality, and high-yield development of animal husbandry. This production team now has more than 26,000 head (or numbers of sheep) of livestock, an increase of 2.8 times compared to the time of communization. The development of horses, cattle, and other large livestock is rapid, and the proportion of improved breeds and crossbred livestock is also rapidly increasing. In 1958, improved breeds of large livestock accounted for 45 percent of the total number of large livestock in this team, but now it has increased to 92 percent, basically achieving the improvement of large livestock breeds.

    After visiting the Xibo Production Team, comrades from Xilingol League said that they previously thought that pastoral mechanization was very mysterious and unattainable, and that only the state could do it, not the herdsmen. After seeing the Xibo Production Team, they realized the wisdom and power of the masses, and saw how wrong it was to think that herdsmen could not master machinery!

    During this long visit and inspection, everyone saw more than 100 types of pastoral machinery along the way. These included mowing machines, water-lifting machines, shearing machines, milking machines, well-drilling machines, and other various machines. These machines are urgently needed in various types of pastoral areas with many livestock, few laborers, and heavy grassland construction tasks. In short, machinery has great potential on the grasslands.

    Snowstorms and Disasters Can Be Overcome
    Snowstorms and disasters on the grasslands are the "major enemies" of developing animal husbandry. How can we completely overcome snowstorms and disasters and ensure the stable development of animal husbandry? The facts in Xianghuang Banner give a great inspiration.

    When visiting Xianghuang Banner, it was already summer after the snowstorm disaster. At that time, the forage had already been used up in other places, but in this banner with poor natural conditions, everywhere we went, in every *hot* (livestock production team), we saw stacks of hay that were both high and large, with stored hay ranging from tens of thousands of *jin* to hundreds of thousands of *jin*. The most was 400,000 *jin*. Jibujin, the banner head of this banner, said that the entire banner still has more than 14 million *jin* of reserve hay like this. Because there is so much reserve hay stored, this banner can win battles in the struggle against snowstorms and disasters.

    Xianghuang Banner went through a series of ideological struggles to break old habits and establish new customs in storing reserve hay. In the past, the banner's methods of resisting snowstorms and disasters mainly relied on natural grazing, moving pastures outward, state support, and buying more feed. In response to these situations, the banner leadership summarized the lessons learned from the large snow disaster of 1962 that killed livestock, educating cadres and herdsmen to establish a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and the idea that man can conquer nature, and to overcome the idea of ​​simple dependence. At the animal husbandry production meeting, the question of "can animal husbandry steadily increase production by relying on moving pastures to neighboring banners and counties every year" was further raised. After discussion, everyone agreed that: we have more livestock, and other people also have more livestock. Relying solely on moving pastures outward is not a long-term solution. Relying solely on state support is also not feasible. The cost of buying feed is too high, which will affect the income of commune members. As a result of the discussion, many people had a deeper understanding of storing hay for disaster preparedness: "Storing hay, in years of disaster, is the life-saving treasure of livestock." This is the reliable way out for the stable development of animal husbandry in Xianghuang Banner. As a result, the work of haymaking and storing reserve hay was vigorously carried out from point to point.

    In 1964, this banner suffered a snowstorm disaster roughly the same as in 1957, and the disaster in some places was even worse than in 1957, but the results were very different. In 1957, due to lack of disaster prevention preparations, the entire banner lost more than 70,000 head (or numbers of sheep) of livestock. In 1964, because the entire banner had sufficient feed stored, livestock not only did not decrease in production due to the disaster, but also increased by more than 63,000 head (or numbers of sheep) compared to 1963.

    Everyone was greatly shocked by what they saw in Xianghuang Banner. Comrades from Hulunbuir League said that the grasslands in Xianghuang Banner are not good, but they can store so much reserve hay. The grass in our area is tall and dense, and the conditions are very good, but we have not stored reserve hay. This is a concrete manifestation of the idea of ​​relying on heaven. Comrades from Hulunbuir League said in the discussion that after returning, every commune and every production team must store reserve hay. Comrades from Urad Middle and Later United Banner said: In the past, we always thought that our banner had no grass to cut. After seeing the grasslands in Xianghuang Banner, which are similar to ours, we realized that they cut grass whenever they have it, and they have cut so much grass. If you don't see it, you won't believe it. Only when you see it do you know that our revolutionary spirit is far behind theirs. In the future, we must think from the worst and strive for the best, change from passively resisting disasters to actively preventing disasters, cut more grass, and store more reserve hay.

    Trees Can Be Planted in Pastoral Areas
    Planting trees and afforestation is still a new task on the boundless grasslands. During this visit and inspection that traversed five leagues from east to west, sometimes everyone drove for a day and did not see a single tree, which made people deeply feel how much tree planting is needed in pastoral areas! However, in pastoral areas, one often hears statements such as, pastoral areas do not need to plant trees, planting trees will affect the development of animal husbandry production; pastoral areas cannot plant trees, even if they are planted they will not survive, and so on.

    The facts of the Wulan Huduke Brigade of the Jire Gala Saihan Commune in Alxa Left Banner show that planting trees in pastoral areas has many benefits and greatly promotes animal husbandry.

    The Wulan Huduke Brigade is on the edge of the famous Tengger Desert. Under the leadership of the Party, they are not afraid of difficulties and have launched an unyielding struggle against the desert. After many failures and setbacks, they were not discouraged and persisted in planting trees year after year. After more than ten years of efforts, they finally built a forest belt 1,500 meters long and 400 meters wide. Like a green barrier, it stands on the front line of the desert, blocking the desert's encroachment and turning the desert into a good pasture. Now, these trees are an average of four meters high, with the highest reaching eleven meters. Not only do they have the effect of preventing wind and fixing sand, but they also increase the moisture in the air, preserve and accumulate soil humus, enhance soil fertility, and create good conditions for the reproduction and growth of various pastures in and around the forest belt. Reeds as high as the chest and pasture as deep as half the knee grow everywhere around the forest belt. Since 1960, 200,000 to 250,000 *jin* (100-125 tons) of grass can be cut from the forest belt and its surroundings every year. Leaves and young branches can also be used to feed livestock, and large branches that are pruned can also be used to build sheds. Since the year before last, the forest belt has also been able to provide grazing for thousands of sheep.

    Everyone was very interested in the vivid facts of the Wulan Huduke Brigade's combination of forestry and animal husbandry and grazing in forest belts. Comrades from East Ujimqin Banner said: "In the past, I always thought that pastoral areas mainly engage in animal husbandry, and it is enough as long as livestock develop. It doesn't matter whether trees are planted or not. Now I realize that planting trees has many benefits. We are pastoral area cadres and will engage in revolution and pastoral area work for a lifetime. If we do not plant trees, plant grass, and open up water sources, and only leave a bare grassland for future generations, how can we explain it!"

    Everyone also visited the Baiyin Hongge'er Forest Farm. This forest farm is located on the grasslands of Sunit Right Banner, where there is drought in nine out of ten years. Upon arriving at the forest farm, we saw a large forest of elms, poplars, sand dates, Scotch pines, and *Tang Qi* (Acer truncatum), which was truly exciting.

    While leading everyone to see the elm forest that grew from dry sowing, the comrades from the forest farm told everyone that they had also taken a winding road on this issue. Four years ago, they afforested more than 300 *mu* (approx. 20 hectares), but the vast majority died. Later, after finding the reasons, it was mainly because the land preparation was both rough and untimely. With this lesson, their forest farm, starting from the characteristics of the local arid grassland, has always insisted on meticulous land preparation, drought prevention, and drought resistance. Two years ago, they planted trees again on the same land, afforesting after plowing three times. Although there was a severe drought that year, the survival rate of the trees was still as high as 85 percent or more.

    This long-distance on-site visit greatly broadened people's horizons, giving everyone a profound and vivid education. Everyone began to establish a revolutionary ideology for building the grasslands, enhanced their confidence in building the grasslands, found the direction, and learned the methods. A new upsurge in grassland construction will gradually be set off throughout Inner Mongolia. The vast and boundless grasslands of Inner Mongolia will be built even more richly and beautifully.

### 草原万里行

专栏：

    草原万里行
    前些时，参加内蒙古草原工作会议的同志们，对自治区各类草原作了一次一万八千里的参观考察。
    通过现场参观，边看边议，大大解放了人们的思想。牧民在各类草原上大搞建设的生动事例和创新精神，使参观的人受到了一次极其深刻的教育，许多疑难问题都得到了正确的答案。
    干旱缺水的草原能够改变
    内蒙古牧区干旱缺水草原约占百分之十九。干旱缺水草原能不能找到水，能不能改变干旱缺水面貌。通过参观和考察表明：所谓干旱缺水草原并不是没有水，只是降雨量少，缺乏河流、湖泊等地表水，地下水往往很丰富，只是水位深一些。许多干旱缺水的草原，只要开发了水源，就是有水有草的好牧场，可以成为发展牲畜的好地方。
    阿拉善左旗是自治区有名的缺水的地方，境内没有一条河流，只在沿贺兰山脚下有一些小溪、泉水。大家参观了这个旗宗别立公社的一个管道引水工程，把山泉水聚集起来，用长达四十来华里的地下管道，将水输送到四方，开辟和改善了三百平方公里牧场，解决了两万头（只）牲畜的夏秋两季饮水和一部分饲料基地的灌溉问题。大家看到拦蓄泉水的塘坝四周，绿树环绕，牧草茂密。在饮水槽旁，大家很兴奋地看到，蓄水池一放水，长长的饮水槽很快便灌满了晶莹的清水，牲畜随时来随时都能够喝足水。
    宗别立公社邻近的社、队，也有两处管道引水工程正在施工。这是牧民们亲眼看到管道引水工程的好处，自动筹集资金修建的。在工地上，各族年青的牧民们，有的正忙着自制水泥管，有的正忙着用车子推土，还有一些青年正用石夯在夯打塘坝地基。
    参观的人议论说，在一些牧区打机井固然是需要的，但是地下管道比起机井来有很多优点：就地取材，建设方便，群众可以自办，管理容易，管理费低，使用年限长。
    从一九五八年以来，阿拉善左旗在牧区水利建设上有很大发展。全旗共打新井两千二百多眼，挖泉三百八十眼，兴修了一些管道引水工程和一些中小型水库、塘坝和旱涝坝。利用这些水利建设，开辟了缺水草场八千九百平方公里，解决了四十五万六千头（只）牲畜的饮水问题，对全旗畜牧业的发展起了极其重要的作用。
    阿拉善左旗给人的印象是很深刻的。这个旗的自然条件很差，但是牧民们的革命精神大，干劲足，在水利建设上做出了出色的成绩。呼伦贝尔盟的同志说，阿拉善左旗无水找水，爱水如油；我们盟里有两个大湖，十多条大河，无数水泉子，但是利用不够，许多水白白流走了。我们那里地下水位浅，容易打井，水井却不多。我们今后要好好向阿拉善左旗学习。
    象侍弄庄稼一样侍弄优质牧草
    草是牲畜的“粮食”，人工种植稳产高产的优质牧草，是保证畜牧业稳产高产的重要条件。近年来，内蒙古全区先后共种植了优质牧草一百二十万亩；绝大多数地方种草是成功的，也有个别地方是不成功的。大家参观过的巴林右旗幸福之路公社和苏尼特右旗朱日和牧草种籽繁殖场，就是一个在人工种植优质牧草上，作法不同、结果两样的鲜明对照。
    一到幸福之路公社的饲草饲料基地，大家便为这里的动人景象吸引住了。五千五百多亩人工种植的优质牧草——苜蓿草，高达二尺，碧绿一片。敖尔盖河水正在源源灌溉苜蓿地。有些牧民正在苜蓿地里铲地松土，增强牧草的抗旱能力；有的牧民正中耕培土，使牧草根子扎得更牢；还有的牧民在缺苗的地方，细心补播草籽。他们象侍弄庄稼一样侍弄优质牧草，无怪乎这些人工种植的苜蓿长得这样茁壮喜人了。
    朱日和牧草种籽繁殖场，却完全是另一个样子。这里也长了一些苜蓿，可是高低参差不齐，断垄缺苗，杂草丛生，比苜蓿长得还高。处处看出，这里的优质牧草还基本上处于无人管理的状态。
    在大草原上种草，这在解放前是不可想象的，是前人没有做过的事。幸福之路公社牧民为什么这样重视种植优质牧草呢？原因很简单。前年，他们种了八百多亩苜蓿，经过细致的田间管理，秋后收获了几十万斤优质牧草，饲养好了大批老弱牲畜。牧民们说：“苜蓿草真是宝，牲畜爱吃又上膘。”正因为牧民认识到种植优质牧草的作用，所以他们才认真做这件事。去年他们把苜蓿草的播种面积扩大了近六倍。
    牧业机器大有用武之地
    在河流纵横、碧草如茵的鄂温克族自治旗，有一个锡尼河西公社西博生产队。
    在这个生产队里，大家看到了社会主义现代化畜牧业的萌芽，看到了经过牧民改革和制造的各种各样的牧业机具：冬季修搭棚圈用的凿眼钻土机、半自动卸粪车、水井掏泥器、木制集草器，把马拉打草机改为拖拉机牵引、在拖拉机牵引的打草机上装配搂草机，等等。
    这个队的能工巧匠们，在改革工具、推行机械化和半机械化的过程中，紧密与生产结合，生产上迫切需要什么，他们就设法制造和改革什么。由于他们采用了机械化和半机械化打草，打贮下的饲草年年有余，做到了放牧与舍饲相结合，对促进畜牧业的稳定、优质、高产，起了很大的作用。这个生产队现在有牲畜两万六千多头（只），比公社化当时增长了二点八倍。马、牛等大牲畜发展很快，良种和改良种牲畜的比例也迅速增长。一九五八年，这个队的良种大牲畜占大牲畜总数百分之四十五，现在已提高到百分之九十二，基本上实现了大牲畜良种化。
    参观过西博生产队后，锡林郭勒盟的同志说，以前认为牧业机械化非常神秘，高不可攀，只有国家能办，牧民搞不了；看了西博生产队，才认清群众的智慧和力量，才看出过去认为牧民不能掌握机器的思想多么错误！
    在这次长途参观和考察过程中，大家一路上看到一百多种牧业机器。这里面有打草机、提水机、剪毛机、挤奶机、打井机，以及其它各种机器。这些机器，对牲畜多、劳力少、草原建设任务重的各类牧区，都是迫切需要的。总之，机器在草原上是大有用武之地的。
    风雪灾害可以战胜
    草原上的风雪灾害是发展畜牧业的“大敌”。如何彻底战胜风雪灾害，保证畜牧业稳定发展呢？镶黄旗的事实给人以很大的启示。
    在镶黄旗参观的时候，早已是风雪灾害过后的夏天。那时在别的地方饲草早已用完了，可是在这个自然条件不好的旗里，大家所到之处，在每个“浩特”（畜群生产组），都看到贮存有既高又大的草垛，贮草数量从几万斤到十几万斤不等，最多的达四十万斤。这个旗的吉布金旗长说，全旗还贮有这样的备荒草一千四百多万斤。正因为贮存有这么多的备荒草，在与风雪灾害斗争上，这个旗就能打胜仗。
    镶黄旗在打贮备荒草上，破除旧习，树立新风，是经过一番思想斗争的。过去，这个旗抗御风雪灾害的办法，主要是靠自然放牧，靠向外移场，靠国家支援，靠多买饲料。针对这些情况，旗领导上总结了一九六二年大雪灾死牲畜的教训，教育广大干部和牧民，树立自力更生、奋发图强、人定胜天的革命精神，克服单纯依赖思想。在畜牧业生产会议上，又进一步提出“年年依靠向邻近旗县移场，畜牧业能不能稳定增产”的问题。经过讨论，大家一致认为：咱们牲畜多了，人家的牲畜也多了，光靠向外移场，不是长远办法。单纯依靠国家支援也是不行的，购买饲料开支大了，会影响社员收入。讨论的结果，不少人对贮草备荒有了进一步的认识：“贮备下草，到了灾年就是牲畜的救命宝。”这是镶黄旗稳定发展畜牧业的可靠出路。于是打草、贮备荒草的工作，便由点到面地轰轰烈烈地开展了起来。
    一九六四年这个旗又遭受了与一九五七年大体相同的风雪灾害，有些地方的灾害比一九五七年还重些，结果却大不一样。一九五七年因缺乏防灾准备，全旗损失了七万多头（只）牲畜，一九六四年因全旗贮备了充足的饲草，牲畜不仅没有因灾减产，还比一九六三年纯增了六万三千多头（只）。
    大家看过镶黄旗情况，思想上震动很大。呼伦贝尔盟的同志说，镶黄旗草场不好，却能贮存下这么多备荒草，我们那里草高草密，条件很好，却没有贮备荒草，这是靠天思想的具体表现。呼盟同志在讨论中都表示，回去后，每个公社每个生产队，都要贮存备荒草。乌拉特中后联合旗的同志说：以前总认为我们旗无草可打，看了镶黄旗的草场和我们旗的差不多，可是人家却有草就打，打下这么多草。不看不相信，一看才知道我们的革命干劲比人家差得远了。今后我们一定从最坏处着想，向最好处努力，变被动抗灾为主动防灾，多打草，多贮备荒草。
    牧区能够种树
    在一望无边的大草原上，植树造林还是一件新工作。在这次横贯东西五个盟的参观和考察中，有时大家坐汽车赶了一天路，还看不到一棵树，使人深深感到，植树造林在牧区多么需要！可是，在牧区却常常听到这样一些说法，牧区不需要种树，种树会影响畜牧业生产的发展；牧区不能种树，就是种了也不会活，等等。
    从阿拉善左旗吉热嘎拉赛汉公社乌兰呼都克大队的事实可以看出，牧区植树有很多好处，对畜牧业有很大的促进作用。
    乌兰呼都克大队在有名的腾格里沙漠边沿。在党的领导下，他们不怕困难，向沙漠展开了坚韧不拔的斗争。他们经过多次失败挫折，并没有灰心，仍然年复一年地坚持植树造林。经过十多年的努力，终于营造起长一千五百米、宽四百米的林带。它象绿色屏障一样，屹立在黄沙前沿，横挡住沙漠的侵袭，并使沙漠变成了良好的牧场。现在，这些树木已平均高四米，最高的达到十一米，不仅起到防风固沙作用，并且增加空中的水分，保存和积累了土壤腐殖质，增强了地力，给林带里和林带周围的各种牧草繁殖生长创造了良好条件。林带周围齐胸的芦苇和半膝深的牧草，遍地生长。从一九六○年起，每年可以从林带里和林带周围打草二十到二十五万斤。树叶、嫩枝又可喂牲畜，修下的大枝条还可以盖棚圈。从前年起，林带里还能供几千只羊的放牧。
    大家对乌兰呼都克大队林牧结合、以林带牧的生动事实很感兴趣。东乌珠穆沁旗的同志说：“过去自己总认为，牧区主要是搞畜牧业，只要牲畜发展就行了。种树不种树没啥。现在才认识到种树有很多好处。我们是牧区干部，要干一辈子革命，搞一辈子牧区工作，如果不种树、种草、开辟水源，只给子孙后代留下光秃秃的草场，怎能交代得过去！”
    大家还参观了白音红格尔林场。这个林场位于十年九旱的苏尼特右旗草原上。一到林场，便看到一片榆、杨、沙枣、油松、唐槭的大树林，真使人兴奋。
    林场同志一边领着大家看干播成活的榆树林，一边告诉大家，他们林场在这个问题上也是走过一段弯路的。四年前，曾造林三百多亩，结果绝大部分都死了。后来一找原因，主要是整地既粗糙又不适时。有了这一教训，他们林场从当地干旱草原的特点出发，一直坚持细致整地、防旱抗旱。两年前他们又在同一土地上植树，耕翻三次后造林，当年虽遇大旱，树木成活率仍高达百分之八十五以上。
    这次长途的现场参观，大大打开了人们的眼界，使大家受到了一次既深刻又生动的教育。大家开始树立了建设草原的革命思想，增强了建设草原的信心，找到了方向，学到了办法。一个草原建设新高潮，将会逐步在内蒙古全区掀起。辽阔无边的内蒙古大草原，将会建设得更加富饶美丽。
