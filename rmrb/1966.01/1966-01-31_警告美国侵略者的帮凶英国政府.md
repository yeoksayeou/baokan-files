    Warning to the British Government, Accomplice of American Aggressors
    By a commentator of this newspaper

    On January 26, the American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" sailed into Hong Kong. On the same evening, another nuclear-powered cruiser, the "Bainbridge," followed into Hong Kong. If we add the armed transport ship "Calvert" and the submarine rescue ship "Coucal," which entered Hong Kong on the 29th, the total number of American warships stationed there reaches as many as nine. The large-scale gathering of American warships in Hong Kong, which are carrying out the heinous mission of slaughtering the Vietnamese people in the South China Sea, is an extremely serious provocative incident.

    Currently, American imperialism is intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam. At this time, the frequent entry and exit of American warships to and from Hong Kong illustrates that the British government is increasingly frantically providing Hong Kong to American imperialism as an important base of operations. Anyone understands that a large number of officers and soldiers, warships, and aircraft of the American aggressor forces are not coming to Hong Kong for sightseeing. This time, the concentration of American warships in the area is clearly an attempt to use Hong Kong as a base to carry out further heinous plans to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    American bandit officers are even swaggering about in Hong Kong, receiving reporters and boasting about their bloody crimes of aggression. This is truly the height of shamelessness! The Chinese people once again warn the American aggressors: The Chinese people have long seen through the aggressive nature of American imperialism and the outwardly strong but inwardly weak essence of American imperialism as a paper tiger. No matter how many troops it deploys, or what kind of aircraft, warships, and missiles it flaunts, it cannot save the American aggressors from their doom. The Chinese people have already made all preparations and are standing by, ready for any war threat from American imperialism.

    At a time when American imperialism is frantically engaged in expanding its war of aggression in Southeast Asia, the British government actually allows a large number of American warships to gather in Hong Kong, effectively permitting the United States to use Hong Kong as a relay base. This is by no means accidental. On the Vietnam issue, the British Labour government has long played an extremely shameful role. On the one hand, it acts as an extremely dishonorable broker for the Johnson administration’s "peace talks" hoax, and on the other hand, it acts as an accomplice to the American war of aggression against Vietnam. The Wilson government colludes with the American aggressors, obeys its master Johnson in every way, and the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong are helping the American aggressors in a big way by providing Hong Kong to the United States as a base for aggression, indicating that they are increasingly deeply involved in the vortex of the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The fact that American warships are allowed to freely enter and leave Hong Kong has already aroused great indignation among Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong residents and public opinion have severely condemned and strongly protested this provocative behavior. The Chinese people believe it is necessary to warn the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong: your practice of using Hong Kong as a base for American imperialism to carry out its war of aggression is an act of hostility towards the Vietnamese people, an act of hostility towards the Chinese people, and an act of hostility towards the entire Southeast Asian people. If you do not change this situation, the only result will be that you will lift a stone only to drop it on your own feet!

    警告美国侵略者的帮凶英国政府
    本报评论员
    一月二十六日，美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”开进香港。同日晚，另一艘核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”也跟着开进香港。如果加进二十九日开进香港的“卡尔弗特号”武装运输舰和“雄鸡号”潜艇救护舰，留在该地的美国军舰总共达九艘之多。在南海执行屠杀越南人民罪恶任务的美国军舰大批聚集香港，是一个十分严重的挑衅事件。
    目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争。在这个时候，美国军舰频繁地进出香港，说明英国政府越来越丧心病狂地把香港提供给美帝国主义作为一个重要的活动基地。任何人都懂得，大批美国侵略军的官兵、军舰、飞机开到香港，决不是来游山玩水的。这一次，美国军舰麕集该地，显然是在企图利用香港作为基地，进行进一步扩大侵略越南战争的罪恶计划。
    美国强盗军官还在香港张牙舞爪地招待记者，把血淋淋的侵略罪行拿来自我吹嘘，真是无耻之尤！中国人民再一次警告美国侵略者：中国人民早就看透了美帝国主义的侵略本性，也早就看透了美帝国主义纸老虎外强中干的实质。不管它调派多少军队，炫耀什么样的飞机、军舰和导弹，决不能挽救美国侵略者自取灭亡的命运。对于美帝国主义的这种战争威胁，中国人民早已作好了一切准备，严阵以待。
    在美帝国主义在东南亚疯狂地从事扩大侵略战争的现在，英国政府竟容许美国军舰大批云集香港，实际上是允许美国利用香港作为中继基地，这决不是偶然的。在越南问题上，英国工党政府久已扮演了一个极其可耻的角色。它一方面充当约翰逊政府“和谈”骗局的极不光彩的掮客，另一方面又充当美国侵略越南战争的帮凶。威尔逊政府同美国侵略者狼狈为奸，对约翰逊主子百依百顺，英国政府和香港英国当局为美国侵略者大帮其忙，把香港提供给美国作为侵略基地，表明它们正在日益深入地卷入侵略越南战争的漩涡。
    美国军舰被允许自由进出香港已经引起了香港居民的极大愤慨，香港居民和舆论严厉谴责并且强烈抗议这一挑衅行为。中国人民认为有必要警告英国政府和香港英国当局：你们把香港作为美帝国主义进行侵略战争的基地的做法，是对越南人民的敌视行为，是对中国人民的敌视行为，也是对整个东南亚人民的敌视行为；你们如果不改变这种情况，那么，结果只能是搬起石头来砸自己的脚！
