    Story on an Ox Cart
    Zheng Qimu
    "Comrade, are you going to Nancha Gully? Come on, get on the cart!
    "Don't worry, you'll be home before dark. Don't underestimate our ox cart. Today we're delivering thin wood strips to the supply and marketing cooperative, and we haven't fallen behind the horse carts by much. Look at this ox, isn't it lively!
    "You guessed right, I graduated from junior high school in 1961 and returned to production. Hey, don't praise me. My cart-driving skills aren't that great yet, I haven't been learning for very long. That's right, I'm happy to do this job from the bottom of my heart. All work is doing revolution, after all.
    "Speaking of which, my thinking also took a turn. When I first came back from school, I dreamed of driving a tractor, but now I understand that tractors don't fall from the sky; we have to pull them out with our ox carts and horse carts!
    "These principles, the old oxherd of our team told me. He's over fifty years old and a Communist Party member. You ask around in Nancha Gully, who doesn't know the famous 'Chen Dabǎ'? That's right, his surname is Chen, and his given name is Wanhai.
    "The commune members supported him when he drove a horse cart. How did he end up feeding oxen? This goes back to the year we bought the cows. The year I graduated and returned to my hometown, the higher-ups allocated a group of cattle to support the production teams in our commune. At that time, our team was still poor, relying entirely on state loans to add carts and buy livestock. That day the cattle arrived at the commune, the captain asked him to come along for consultation and select a few good cattle to bring back. After half a day, the cattle were led back. The commune members crowded the production team's courtyard, thinking that they would bring back a few strong bulls. But when they got closer, alas, they were three yellow cows! At this time, the captain told everyone about the selection process. Originally, he wanted to get two bulls according to the loan amount; but on the way to the commune, Uncle Chen repeatedly told him: 'We can't only care about the present, we have to look into the future! We haven't paid attention to breeding livestock in the past few years, think about how much we lost! We have mountains and water, meadows and grass here. Let's pick a few cows to take back. The team has existing bulls. In a few years, we'll surely have a herd of cattle.' The captain thought it made sense, so he chose three cows, one of which was pregnant….
    "In the past, our team's cattle were not managed by specific people. Now that there are more cattle, they must be taken care of by specific people. This is a hard job, who should do it? Just as the captain was thinking about it, Uncle Chen came to him himself. He happily said to the captain: 'I thought about it the day we got the cattle, let me feed the cattle!' The captain told everyone about this, who wouldn't support it? Then someone suggested that Uncle Chen was originally a strong laborer, and feeding cattle should also be evaluated as first-class work points, otherwise everyone would feel bad. But Uncle Chen refused no matter what. He said: 'Fellow villagers! You trust me, and that's worth a thousand gold. If I feed the cattle, I don't seek fame or fortune. It's to vigorously develop production and contribute to our revolutionary cause! Work points must not be increased!' His words rang like a gong, shaking everyone's hearts!
    "After he became the old oxherd, he really put all his energy into the cattle. From autumn to summer, the livestock plowed the land, pulled the land, delivered grain and pulled manure. The work was very tiring. In the past, our team's livestock couldn't gain autumn fat, but this year, the cattle's butts are all round.
    "Whoa—there's a car coming behind us, it's the supply and marketing cooperative transporting fertilizer to the mountainous area. Let's pull the cart to the side.
    "Next spring, the first calf was born, and Uncle Chen was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth all day. But trouble also happened. This year was a spring drought, and the livestock got sick. Some of the cattle were shaking all over, panting with their mouths wide open, drooling white foam. Uncle Chen was anxious, and the commune members were also anxious!
    "One evening, I heard that a cow was very sick, so I went to see it. I saw Uncle Chen kneeling next to the sick cow, one hand holding the cow's neck, one arm with the sleeve rolled up high, pulling mucus and saliva out of the cow's nose and mouth! Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but shout: 'Uncle Chen, you're really putting your heart into it!' Uncle Chen was startled when he suddenly heard my voice. When he turned around and saw it was me, he smiled and said, 'Dazhuzi, this cow is the treasure of the commune members! If we take good care of it, we will increase the strength of the people's commune and win a breath for our poor and lower-middle peasant brothers!' I opened my eyes wide and excitedly said, 'Win a breath?' 'That's right!' He straightened his chest, waved his hand, and said loudly: 'It is to strive for revolutionary ambition! Let people see how we use our own hands to get rid of the poverty hat!' His words were all honestly spoken from the heart.
    "After passing this mountain pass, you can see Nancha Gully. Look, how well this large field of crops is growing. You wouldn't have thought that a year ago, the weeds here were waist-deep! Speaking of opening up this wilderness, we have to mention Uncle Chen.
    "As the saying goes: one cow enters the village, and in five years it becomes a herd. Four years after Uncle Chen took over feeding the cattle, he really pulled together a herd. Last year, our commune carried out a socialist education movement, and the commune members' thinking improved, and their labor enthusiasm was like oil on fire, and production was in full swing. At this time, the brigade proposed to collectively open up sixty hectares of wasteland. As soon as the task of opening up wasteland came down, and the fields had to be planted early, the livestock of each team was not enough. Our team's cattle herd became a 'sweet bun'. Several teams came to ask for help. The members of our team unanimously agreed with Uncle Chen's opinion: to support the outside teams with good cattle.
    "That's right, it was when opening up the wasteland that I signed up for the cattle plow team. At that time, we were studying Chairman Mao's 'In Memory of Norman Bethune'. Uncle Chen said to us: 'Norman Bethune, for the sake of the revolution, still strove for perfection even with such high medical skills. You young people should learn from this spirit when learning farm work!' We had a lively discussion and decided to learn from the old farmers and take on the "four hards" of driving the cart, holding the plow, planting seeds, and opening seedlings. Now, none of the young people in our team are bad at using livestock!
    "Giddy up! We are about to enter the village. Look at the big guy on the opposite hill, the one carrying the sheep whip, is Uncle Chen. He is now the chairman of our poor association. Our team is also raising sheep, this is a new family business, and Uncle Chen has become the old shepherd again!
    "Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up!"

    牛车上的故事
    郑其木
    “同志，你上咱南岔沟。来，上车吧！
    “你别急，天黑前准到家。别看咱这是牛车，今儿给供销社送梢条，也没叫马车拉下多少。你瞧这牛，多欢势啦！
    “你猜对了，我是一九六一年初中毕业回来生产的。嘿，你可别夸。我这赶车技术还不过硬啊，学赶车时间还不长。对啦，我打心眼里乐意干这活。啥工作都是干革命嘛。
    “说起来，我这思想也是转了个弯的。刚从学校回来那阵，做梦都想开拖拉机，可我现在明白了，拖拉机不能打天上掉下来，要靠咱用牛车、马车把它拉出来！
    “这些道理呀，都是我们队的老牛倌告诉我的。他有五十多岁啦，是个共产党员。你到南岔沟打听打听，谁不知道有名的‘陈大把’？对，他姓陈，大号万海。
    “他赶马车社员可拥护啦，以后怎么交了大鞭喂牛的呢，这就说到那年买母牛的事儿上了。就在我毕业回乡那年，上级拨来一帮牛支援我们公社各生产队。那时候，我们队还穷，全仗国家贷款来添车买牲口。那天牛到公社了，队长让他一起去参谋参谋，选几头好牛回来。半天，牛牵回来了，社员们满满挤了生产队一院子，心想，准是牵回几头虎虎势势的生牤子吧。可是，到跟前一看，咳，竟是三条黄母牛！这时，队长就把选牛的经过跟大伙说了一遍，原先，他照着贷款的数目，也想牵它两头生牤子；可去公社这一道上，老陈叔反反复复跟他说：‘咱不能只顾眼前，得往远看哪！这几年没注意繁殖牲口，想想损失多大！咱这里有山有水，有甸子有草，咱挑几头母牛回去，队里有现成的牤子，过几年，准能拉起一帮牛群。’队长想想有道理，就挑了三头母牛，有一头还是带肚儿的……。
    “过去咱队的牛没专人管，现在牛多了，非得专人侍弄不可。这是个苦差事，找谁干呢？队长正寻思，老陈叔却自己找上门去了。他乐滋滋地对队长说：‘牵牛那天我就想好啦，让我喂牛吧！’队长把这事跟大伙一说，谁不拥护？接着就有人提意见，说老陈叔原是强劳力，喂牛也应该评头等工分，要不大伙过意不去。可是老陈叔横竖不答应。他说：‘乡亲们哪！大伙信得着我，这就是千金难买的。要说我喂牛，一不图名，二不图利，为的是猛猛发展生产，为咱革命大业出一分力量！工分，决不能多要！’他的话，象铜锣一样当当响，震的大伙心里直搧呼！
    “他当上老牛倌以后，真是把全副心劲都使在牛身上了。一秋带八夏，牲口趟地、拉地，又是送粮拉粪，活计顶吃累了。往年咱队的牲口秋膘老抓不上去，可是这一年，牛屁股都吃得溜圆。
    “吁——后面来汽车了，那是供销社往山区运化肥。咱把车往边上靠靠。
    “转年开春，第一头小牛犊生下来了，把老陈叔喜的整天合不拢嘴。可是，麻烦事儿也发生了。这年春旱，牲口发病了，有几头牛浑身抖抖颤颤，哈着大嘴直淌白沫子。老陈叔心里急，社员们也急！
      “有一天傍黑，我听说有头母牛病的挺重，走去看看。见老陈叔跪在那头病牛旁边，一只手扶着牛脖子，一只胳臂袖挽得老高，一把一把从牛的鼻子和嘴里往外掏鼻涕唾沫呢！看到这情景，我不禁喊了起来：‘老陈叔，你真费心思啊！’老陈叔猛一听见我的声音，吃了一惊，转过头来，看到是我，才笑着说：‘大柱子啊，这牛，是社员的心头肉啊！咱们把它侍弄好了是为人民公社增一分力量，为咱贫下中农哥们争了口气！’我睁大了眼睛，激动地说：‘争气？’‘对啦！’他挺了挺胸脯，把手一挥，大声地说：‘就是要争革命的大志气！让人们瞧瞧，咱们是怎么用自己的双手把穷帽子摘掉的！’他的话，句句都是打心里实打实掏出来的。
    “转过这个山口，就能看见南岔沟啦。你瞧啊，这大片庄稼长的多好，你没想到吧，一年前，这里还是荒草齐腰深哩！说起开这片荒，还得说到老陈叔身上。
    “俗话说：一牛进屯，五年成群。老陈叔接手喂牛到四年头上，真就拉扯起了一帮牛群。去年，我们公社搞过社会主义教育运动，社员们思想都提高了，劳动干劲儿就象火上泼了油，生产搞得热火朝天。这时大队提出要集体开出六十垧荒地。开荒任务一下来，又要提早种大田，各队的牲口就不够用了。我们队的牛群，就成了‘香饽饽’啦。几个队都来求援。我们队的社员，大伙一致同意老陈叔的意见：把好牛支援外队。
    “对了，就是开荒那时，我报名上了牛犁杖组。那时我们正学习毛主席写的《纪念白求恩》呢。老陈叔对我们说：‘人家白求恩为了革命，医道那么高还精益求精。你们这帮小年轻的，学农活就得好好学学这股精神！’我们热热闹闹讨论了一气，决心要拜老农为师，闯闯赶车、扶犁、点种、开苗这‘四大硬’。现在呀，我们队的哪个年轻人，使牲口都不赖啊！
    “驾！咱们就要进屯啦，你看对面山岗上，那个拎羊鞭的大个子，就正是老陈叔呢。他如今是我们的贫协主席。我们队又养羊群啦，这是项新家业，老陈叔又当上老羊倌啦！
    “驾！驾！驾！”
