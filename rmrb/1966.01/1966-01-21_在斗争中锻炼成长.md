    Growing and Maturing in Struggle
    Must consciously study Chairman Mao's writings, learn the revolutionary experience of the older generation of comrades, learn from the experience of the masses, and constantly use the five requirements for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause to demand and examine oneself.

    I started working in 1949. In October 1964, the Party transferred me to be the Organization Minister of the Gu'an County Party Committee. In the Socialist Education Movement of 1965, I was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee.
    New job responsibilities presented many difficulties. Many problems required me to understand and solve them. At first, I was busy all day but couldn't figure things out. At that time, I secretly asked myself: The Party has entrusted you with a heavy responsibility, can you do it well? At this moment, the superior Party issued a call to extensively study Chairman Mao's works. I studied Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause with this question in mind. I realized that to take over the proletarian revolutionary cause, one should overcome all difficulties and go to the three great revolutionary movements to temper oneself and improve. Thus, I mustered the courage to consciously shoulder heavy burdens.
    In the past year, although I have not made much progress in my work, there is still pride deep in my mind. These emotions easily manifest when my strengths are brought into play. I studied Chairman Mao's view of "one divides into two," and applied it to myself, mainly to find shortcomings and determine the direction of efforts. I grew up in a peaceful environment, so I need to earnestly temper my revolutionary fighting will, strengthen ideological transformation in class struggle, firmly establish a revolutionary worldview, and enrich my knowledge of production struggles. At the same time, I also divide the veteran comrades around me into two, mainly looking at their strengths and consciously learning from them. The biggest strength of our county party secretary is that he has rich experience in class struggle and production struggle, a democratic work style, and decisive handling of problems. Although the county magistrate is over fifty, he has a vigorous revolutionary spirit and is diligent and conscientious in the cause of the Party and consistently strives hard. The strengths of these comrades are what I need to learn. Because I use Chairman Mao's view of "one divides into two," I learn the Party's fine traditions from these veteran comrades and become more conscious.
    My time working in rural areas is still very short, far from meeting the needs of my work responsibilities, and even further from the Party's requirements. But I have the determination and confidence to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. In the future, I will more consciously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, humbly learn from the strengths of the older generation of revolutionaries, humbly learn from the masses, constantly use the five requirements for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause to demand and examine myself, be brave in practice, and quickly master the knowledge of class struggle and production struggle. I will strive to be a good revolutionary successor and make every effort to achieve new results in my work in the new year.

    在斗争中锻炼成长
    必须自觉学习毛主席著作，学习老一辈同志的革命经验，学习群众的经验，经常用无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件来要求和检查自己
    我一九四九年参加工作。一九六四年十月，党根据工作需要，调我任固安县委组织部长，一九六五年社会主义教育运动中，又提拔我担任县委副书记。
    新的工作岗位，在我的面前摆出许多困难。许多问题要求我去认识和解决。开始，整天忙乱，理不出个头绪来。当时，暗暗问自己：党把重担交给你，能干好吗？正在这个时候，上级党发出了大学毛主席著作的号召，我就带着这个问题学习主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示，认识到接好无产阶级革命事业的班，就应当克服一切困难，到三大革命运动中去锻炼、提高。从而鼓起了勇气，自觉挑重担子。
    一年来，工作虽然没作出多大成绩，可是思想深处还有骄傲情绪。这些情绪，在自己长处得到发挥时就容易表现出来。我学了毛主席一分为二的观点，把自己一分为二，主要是找出缺点，确定努力方向。我是在和平环境里长大，这就需要认真磨练自己的革命斗争意志，在阶级斗争中加强思想改造，牢固树立革命的世界观，丰富生产斗争的知识。同时，对周围的老同志也一分为二，主要看他们的优点，有意识地学习他们的长处。我们的县委书记最大的长处是：阶级斗争、生产斗争经验丰富，作风民主，处理问题果断；县长虽然年过五旬，但是革命精神旺盛，对党的事业勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，一贯艰苦奋斗。这些同志的优点都是我需要学习的。由于用毛主席一分为二的观点，我从这些老同志身上学习党的优良传统，更加自觉了。
    我在农村工作时间还很短，远不能适应所负工作责任的需要，距离党的要求差得更远。但是我有决心，有信心完成党交给的任务。今后要更加自觉地努力学习毛主席著作，虚心学习老一辈革命者的长处，虚心向群众学习，经常用无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件要求和检查自己，勇于实践，尽快掌握起阶级斗争生产斗争的知识，努力做一个好的革命接班人，并在新的一年里，在工作上尽一切努力做出新的成绩。
