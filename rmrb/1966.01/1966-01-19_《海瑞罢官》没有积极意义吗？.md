    Does "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Have No Positive Significance?
    Lu Yu
    Some comrades say that Hai Rui's "land return" was to protect the interests of small and medium landlords and rich peasants, and his "redressing of unjust verdicts" blurred the fighting will of the peasants and strengthened the dictatorship of the landlord class over the peasants, and that both of these things were to consolidate the long-term interests of the entire landlord class. Is that really the case? I would like to express some different opinions.
    Hai Rui's Standing on the Side of the "People" to Fight Against the "Officials" is Commendable
    According to historical records, Hai Rui did carry out "land return." Official history also says that he "governed strictly, ordering those who had received the land to return it all, or perhaps redeem it." From the words "strictly," "all," and "perhaps," we can see that Hai Rui's attitude toward this struggle was very firm, the scope of the struggle was also very broad, and the methods adopted were relatively flexible. Hai Rui's manuscripts and other records all say that "land return" was to prevent "the people's property from gradually disappearing" and to prevent "the people's property" from flowing into the hands of "officials." So, who exactly did Hai Rui's "land return" represent the interests of?
    The "people" Hai Rui spoke of referred to those who had not been "officials," that is, generally small and medium landlords, rich peasants, and merchants. In Hai Rui's eyes, although these "people" had some land, they were "weaker" compared to those "officials" and "gentry" with power and influence. If officials and gentry wanted them to "dedicate" their land, they would "dare not refuse." Therefore, Hai Rui wanted to stand up for them. We have to think about it, Hai Rui himself was an "official" of the Ming Dynasty, but he stood on the side of the "people" to fight against the "officials." Is this a trivial matter, or is it a commendable thing? I ask, how many officials from the landlord class in history dared to do this?
    Some comrades say that "land return" was a deceptive trick, and didn't Xu Jie himself also engage in "land return"? I think that Xu Jie's actions and Hai Rui's actions have many important differences. Xu Jie only submitted a memorial after Prince Jing, Zhu Yizhen, died, returning the land of Prince Jing, Zhu Yizhen, which was easy to do; Hai Rui, however, went through a long, resolute, and ruthless struggle with Xu Jie before making Xu Jie bow his head and concede. Xu Jie engaged in "land return," but he himself occupied more land, which shows that Xu Jie's "land return" was an attempt to gain political capital, to "seek fame and reputation"; Hai Rui, however, did not occupy other people's land, which shows that he was truly for the benefit of the "people." Furthermore, Xu Jie's return of Prince Jing, Zhu Yizhen's land was also related to the power struggle between the court and the imperial family at that time; Hai Rui, however, did not have any other purpose, but only for the loss of people's property. If we can combine it with his other achievements to examine it, his "land return" struggle is indeed very touching. Therefore, although Xu Jie and Hai Rui both engaged in land return, the value of the two cannot be confused.
    Although Hai Rui represented the interests of small and medium landlords and rich peasants, does this mean that it consolidated the long-term interests of the entire landlord class? My opinion is no.
    In the late Ming Dynasty, at a time when land was being massively annexed and class contradictions were becoming increasingly serious, the economic status of small and medium landlords and rich peasants was also very unstable. The land forcibly occupied by bureaucratic landlords through "dedication" was mainly their land. Therefore, they could be differentiated to the side of the peasants at any time. Hai Rui's "land return" did indeed benefit them the most, but this struggle could arouse the sympathy of other oppressed and exploited classes of people. In particular, the unfolding of the "land return" struggle could help the broad masses of peasants further see the sinful nature of bureaucratic landlords relying on their power and influence to seize land. Therefore, Hai Rui's resolute measure could arouse the goodwill of the broad masses of peasants towards him.
    Furthermore, because small and medium landlords and rich peasants did not have power and influence and lacked economic security, they were not the main targets of the peasant revolution at that time. They should be regarded by the most revolutionary class at that time—the peasant class—as an alliance that was both united and limited to a certain extent, and could form a united front to jointly deal with the most important enemies at that time—bureaucratic landlords and corrupt officials, and overthrow the feudal autocratic Zhu dynasty. Didn't the Li Zicheng peasant revolution, which took place not long after Hai Rui, absorb some enlightened figures from among the small and medium landlords to participate in the uprising? In this sense, although Hai Rui's "land return" was to curb the "cunning and dangerous" "folk customs" and the "hundred years of peace" of the Xu family, the objective effect it achieved far exceeded his subjective intentions. Therefore, to negate his achievements from Hai Rui's class line of "land return" is not a historical materialist argument, nor is it a "one divides into two" scientific attitude.
    Since Hai Rui's "land return" was not an action that was isolated from the people at that time, and could to a certain extent win the support of the people, then Wu Han's Comrade Wu Han, in his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," through rendering and exaggeration of artistic means, concentratedly wrote about the scene of this struggle, and it is by no means that it has no positive significance at all.
    Is "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Advocating Class Reconciliation?
    Speaking of the problem of Hai Rui "redressing unjust verdicts," I think that Hai Rui strangling Xu Ying to death was indeed a fabrication by the playwright based on his own wishes, but we cannot ignore Hai Rui's other many records and legends of "appealing for the people" and going against powerful eunuchs. Leaving aside these facts, let us just talk about the principle of whether this is beautifying the laws of the landlord class.
    The laws of the feudal dynasty were a tool for the landlord class to oppress the peasants. However, Hai Rui took the affairs of the "people" very seriously, and dared to risk his life to wage this or that struggle against the "powerful." At that time, the "officials" and "gentry" in the Jiangnan area really hated him very much. Then, it is not entirely wrong for "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to describe him as "pleading for the people" and "judging cases like a god." If we simply say that he did this to consolidate the dictatorship of the landlord class, then it is probably a bit too simplistic.
    I think that the idea of benevolent governance is the most positive part of Confucianism. Hai Rui, as a "upright official," possessed this kind of thinking. In his youth, he had the ambition of "serving the emperor and benefiting the people, taking virtuous governance as the foundation." This kind of thinking became the most basic force in his lifelong struggle, and it was also the ideological basis for him to become an "upright official." When peasants or other wronged people filed lawsuits with him and received "redress," the fundamental role was not played by the laws of the landlord class, but by Hai Rui, the specific person, that is, Hai Rui's idea of benevolent governance. When Hai Rui accepted unjust cases, of course, he must first consider whether this case would harm the fundamental interests of the landlord class. This is also Hai Rui's class prejudice and limitations. But the result was that Hai Rui offended many local notables, while the "common people" at that time called him "Qingtian" (lit. "blue sky," meaning an upright official). This shows that there was a contradiction between the objective consequences of Hai Rui's actions and his subjective intentions and class instincts. I think that consolidating the landlord class regime and safeguarding the interests of this class was indeed Hai Rui's class demand, but when he dealt with many shocking cases, his idea of benevolent governance and sense of responsibility would take the upper hand. This is just like many outstanding writers and poets in our history, although they came from bureaucratic landlord families, although they had the loyalist idea of "making the emperor like Yao and Shun," but when they came into contact with many shocking creative materials, they would relate to their own painful experiences, and they would write chapters that would be passed down through the ages. Of course, in the deeds and poems they left behind, there are still traces of their class, which is not surprising.
    Of course, kneeling down to a "upright official" to file a lawsuit was not the real way out for the peasants at that time. The only way out was to participate in the peasant revolution of armed struggle and completely smash the feudal system. But it would probably not be in line with the actual situation to ask all the peasants to participate in armed struggle at that time, regardless of the various complex conditions! As for whether the exaggeration and fabrication of this kind of "redressing unjust verdicts" in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is to reconcile class struggle, is this statement correct? Fortunately, facts have proved that the peasants in Hai Rui's era were not fooled by Hai Rui's "trick." More than fifty years after Hai Rui's death, the great peasant revolution in Shaanxi buried this feudal autocratic Zhu dynasty. Otherwise, Hai Rui would really become a historical sinner for all ages! I feel that I can ask in return, if Hai Rui should be given such a crime, then are those corrupt officials and powerful nobles worthy of praise instead? They would not "redress unjust verdicts" for the people, nor would they engage in "land return," and they would not do a good deed for the people, but only do bad deeds. Then they awakened the fighting spirit of the peasants and played a role in weakening the Ming Dynasty regime. In this way, wouldn't they become great heroes in history? My counter-question is not intended to be a joke, but only to more conveniently explain that the evaluation of a historical figure with popular influence should be calm and comprehensive.
    Negating Hai Rui and Hai Rui's Play is Not Necessarily a Historical Attitude
    Some comrades say that the laws, courts, and officials who exercise the power of rule in feudal states, including "upright officials" and "good officials," can only be tools of the landlord class's dictatorship, and can never be supra-class, and can never be tools that serve both the ruling class and the ruled class. Therefore, under this premise, Hai Rui can only do his best for the landlord class, and any "upright official" in the feudal era can only be loyal to the supreme ruler within this class range. I want to ask in return again, even if "upright officials" like Hai Rui cannot jump out of their class circle, then are the people of the previous and later generations who praised Hai Rui also out of the maintenance of the interests of the landlord class? I think that the struggle between "uprightness" and "evil" within the rulers is not an accidental phenomenon, nor is it a simple "internal problem" of the rulers, but an inevitable product of social development and the development of class struggle. In Hai Rui's era, land was highly concentrated in the hands of bureaucratic landlords, especially in the Jiangnan area. Under such circumstances, the opposition between the peasants and the rulers deepened day by day, which prompted the rulers to have great differences in their treatment of land and peasant issues, and thus there was a struggle between "uprightness" (enlightened faction) and "evil" (stubborn faction). This struggle is actually a reflection of the struggle between the peasants and the ruling class within the ruling class. At such a critical juncture, Hai Rui stood up and said some fair words and took some measures that were beneficial to the people (such as repairing the Wusong River), although it was to save the demise of the Ming Dynasty, but objectively it was also in line with the interests of the peasants. We know that under feudal rule, although peasants were dissatisfied with the feudal exploitation system, they still placed infinite illusions on reality. Stalin said that peasants opposed feudal exploitation, but hoped for a "good emperor." Then, it is understandable that "upright officials" like Hai Rui have been widely praised throughout history. Moreover, the struggle between "upright officials" and "corrupt officials" is not smooth sailing, and their tragic experiences will have some educational effect on the peasants. This is telling the peasants that "upright officials" stand up to do some good deeds for them, but they do not get the appreciation of the supreme ruler. This can also help the broad masses of peasants to recognize the sinful nature of feudal rule. It can be seen that the emergence of the struggle between "upright officials" and "corrupt officials" is an extremely complex issue, which needs to be viewed with a microscopic eye, and its significance cannot be exhausted in one sentence.
    In this sense, the reason why the "Hai Rui play" has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has endured for a long time is because it has such factors. It is not an exaggeration to say that it has a certain degree of popularity. Only seeing the side of Hai Rui being loyal to the interests of the landlord class, and not seeing the various complex and other positive factors revealed through the struggle between "uprightness" and "evil," and thus concluding that the essence of the landlord class is the starting point and destination of all Hai Rui's actions, and then fundamentally negating Hai Rui and "Hai Rui's play" with a light stroke, this is not necessarily a historical attitude to learning.

    《海瑞罢官》没有积极意义吗？
    陆雨
    有的同志说，海瑞的“退田”是为了维护中小地主和富农的利益，“平冤狱”是模糊了农民的斗争意志，是强化了地主阶级对农民的专政，这两件事都是为了巩固整个地主阶级的长远利益。事情果真是这样的吗？我愿意谈点不同的意见。
    海瑞站在“民”一边向“官”作斗争是难能可贵的
    据历史记载，海瑞搞“退田”确有其事。官史也说他“严厉以治，下令受献者悉退还，或许赎回”。我们从“严厉”、“悉”、“或许”等字眼上可以看出，海瑞对这一斗争态度非常坚决，斗争的面也很广，采取的办法也比较灵活。海瑞文稿和其它记载都说，“退田”是为了“民产渐消”，制止“民产”流失到“官”的手里去。那末，海瑞的“退田”到底代表了哪些人的利益呢？
    海瑞说的“民”是指没有做过“官”的人，即一般中小地主、富农和商人。在海瑞的目光里，这些“民”虽然有一些田产，然而他们与那批有权有势的“官”和“绅”比起来就是“弱者”，官绅向他们要“投献”，他们就“莫敢不与”。所以海瑞要为他们打抱不平。我们得想一想，海瑞本人是明朝的“官”，却站在“民”的一边向“官”作斗争，这究竟是微不足道的事呢，还是难能可贵的事呢？试问，历史上能有几个出身于地主阶级的官吏敢于这样做呢？
    有的同志说，“退田”是骗人的把戏，徐阶本人不是也搞过“退田”吗？我认为徐阶搞的和海瑞搞的有许多重要的区别。徐阶是在景王朱圳死了以后才上奏一本，退了景王朱圳的田，这是轻而易举的；海瑞却是和徐阶经过了一场很久的坚决的无情的斗争，才使徐阶低头让步的。徐阶搞了“退田”，自己却占了更多的田，这说明徐阶的“退田”是企图捞一把政治资本，是“沽名钓誉”；海瑞却没有占过别人的田，这说明他是真正地为了“民”的利益。再者，徐阶搞退景王朱圳的田，还联系着当时宫廷、皇族夺权的倾轧；海瑞却没有夹杂其他目的，只是为了民产的流失。如果我们能结合他的其他政绩来考察，他的“退田”斗争确实是很叫人感动的。因此，徐阶和海瑞同样搞了退田，两者的价值却不能混为一谈。
    虽然海瑞代表了中小地主和富农的利益，但是这是不是就算巩固了整个地主阶级的长远的利益呢？我的意见是否定的。
    在明代后期土地大量兼并、阶级矛盾日趋严重的关头，中小地主和富农的经济地位也非常不稳，官僚地主通过“投献”强占的土地主要是他们的土地。因此，他们随时可能分化到农民一边去。海瑞搞“退田”也确是使他们最受其惠，但这一斗争可以引起别的受压迫、受剥削阶层人们的同情。特别是“退田”斗争的展开，可以帮助广大农民进一步看清官僚地主依仗权势占夺田产的罪恶本质。因此，海瑞这一坚决的措施，是可以引起广大农民对他好感的。
    再者，由于中小地主和富农没有权势，缺乏经济上的保障，所以他们在那时不是农民革命的主要对象。他们应该被当时最有革命性的阶级——农民阶级看作是又有团结、又有限制的一定程度的联盟，可以结成共同对付当时最主要敌人——官僚地主和贪官污吏的统一战线，推翻封建独裁的朱姓王朝。在海瑞以后不久的李自成农民革命，不就是吸收过中小地主中的某些开明人物参加起义的吗？在这个意义上看，海瑞搞“退田”尽管是为了遏止“刁险”的“民风”和徐家的“百年安静”，但收到的客观作用却远远超越了他的主观意图。因此，要想从海瑞“退田”的阶级路线来否定他的功绩，这不是历史唯物主义的论断，也不是“一分为二”的科学态度。
    既然海瑞的“退田”并不是与当时人民绝缘的行动，而在一定程度上是可以取得人民拥护的，那么吴晗同志在他的《海瑞罢官》里通过烘染和夸张的艺术手段，集中地写了这一斗争的场面，决不是一点积极意义都没有的。
    《海瑞罢官》是宣扬阶级调和吗？
    说到海瑞“平冤狱”的问题，我认为，海瑞绞死徐瑛一场固然是剧作者根据自己的愿望虚构出来的，但决不能无视海瑞其他许多“为民昭雪”而和权宦过不去的记载和传说。这些事实姑且不论，我们就谈谈这是不是美化地主阶级的法律这一原则问题吧。
    封建王朝的法律是地主阶级欺压农民的工具。而海瑞却把“民”的事看得非常认真，专门敢冒着风险向“强项”作这样的或那样的斗争。当时江南地方的“官”、“绅”确实对他非常讨厌。那末，《海瑞罢官》描写他“为民请命”、“断案如神”，也并不是十分不对的。如果单单说他这样做是为了巩固地主阶级的专政，那恐怕过于简单化了一点。
    我认为，仁政主义思想是儒家学说中最积极的部分。作为“清官”的海瑞，就具有这种思想。他在少年时就有“效君图上，以德政为本”的抱负。他这种思想就成了他一生斗争中最基本的力量，也就是他所以能成为“清官”的思想基础。农民或者其他一些受冤的人向他告状得到“昭雪”，这里起着根本作用的不是地主阶级的法律，而是海瑞这个具体的人，即海瑞的仁政主义思想。海瑞在受理冤案的时候，当然必先考虑的是这个案件会不会损害地主阶级的根本利益。这也就是海瑞的阶级偏见和局限性。但结果是海瑞得罪了许多乡宦，而当时的“小民”却呼之为“青天”。这就说明海瑞行事客观后果和他主观意图、阶级本能发生了格格不入的矛盾。我认为，巩固地主阶级政权和维护这个阶级的利益确是海瑞的阶级要求，但当他处理到许许多多惊心触目的案件的时候，他的仁政主义思想和责任感就会占上风。这正好象我国历史上不少杰出的文学家、诗人一样，他们虽则出身于官僚地主家庭，虽则有“致君于尧舜”的忠君思想，但当他们接触到许许多多惊心动魄的创作素材就会联系到自身的痛苦经历，他们就会写出千古传诵的篇章。当然，在他们所留下的事迹和诗篇里仍有斑斑可寻的阶级痕迹，这一点是不足为奇的。
    当然，向“清官”跪下来告状，这不是当时农民的真正出路，唯一的出路只能是参加武装斗争的农民革命，彻底粉碎封建制度。但不问当时种种复杂的条件，叫所有的农民都参加武装斗争，这恐怕不合实际情况的吧！至于《海瑞罢官》里夸大、虚构了这种“平冤狱”的描写，就是调和阶级斗争，这个说法对不对呢？还好，事实证明海瑞时代的农民没有中海瑞的“鬼计”。在海瑞死后五十多年，陕西的农民大革命就埋葬了这个封建集权的朱姓王朝。不然，海瑞真地要成为历史上千古罪人了！我觉得可以反问一下，假使海瑞该受到这样的罪名的话，那末那班贪官污吏、豪门权贵反而值得表扬的了。他们不会替百姓“平冤狱”，也不会搞“退田”，不会替老百姓做一件好事，只能做坏事，那他们倒是唤醒了农民的斗志，起着削弱明朝政权的作用，这样，他们岂不是成了历史上的大功臣吗？我这样的反问并不是存心开玩笑，而只是为了更方便地说明对一个有民间影响的历史人物的评价应该冷静、全面。
    否定海瑞和海瑞戏未必是历史主义的态度
    有的同志说，封建国家的法律、法庭和执行统治权力的官吏，包括“清官”、“好官”在内，只能是地主阶级专政的工具，而决不可能是超阶级的，决不可能是既为统治阶级服务又为被统治阶级服务的工具。因此在这个前题下，海瑞只能是为地主阶级鞠躬尽瘁，任何封建时代的“清官”也都只能在这个阶级范围里效忠于最高统治者。我又要反问一下，就算海瑞那样的“清官”跳不出他们的阶级圈子，那末歌颂海瑞的前朝后代的人民是不是也是出于维护地主阶级利益呢？我认为，统治者内部“清”与“邪”的斗争，这不是偶然的现象，也不是单纯统治者的“内部问题”，而是社会发展、阶级斗争发展的必然产物。海瑞那个时代，土地高度集中在官僚大地主手里，江南一带尤甚。在这种情况下，农民和统治者的对立日益加深，就促使统治者内部在对待土地、农民问题上出现了很大的分歧，也就出现了“清”（开明派）与“邪”（顽固派）的斗争。这种斗争实际上也就是农民和统治阶级斗争在统治阶级内部的反映。海瑞在这样的严重关头，起来说了一些公正的话，采取了一些有利于人民的措施（如修吴淞江），虽然是为了挽救明王朝的覆灭，但客观上也是符合农民利益的。我们知道，在封建统治下农民虽然不满意封建剥削制度，但他们对现实却仍寄于无限的幻想。斯大林说过，农民反对封建剥削，但希望有“好皇帝”。那末，海瑞那样的“清官”，深受历来人们的传颂是可以理解的了。况且“清官”和“贪官”的斗争不是一帆风顺的，他们最后悲惨遭遇是会对农民起一些教育作用的。这正告诉农民，“清官起来为他们做一些好事，却得不到最高统治者的赞赏。这也可以帮助广大农民认识封建统治的罪恶本质。可见出现“清官”和“贪官”的斗争，是个极为复杂的问题，需要用显微镜般的眼光来看待，而不能用一句话说尽其意义。
    在这个意义上，历来的“海瑞戏”之所以深入人心，经久不衰，就是因为有这样的因素。说它有一定的人民性，也并非过誉。只看到海瑞效忠于地主阶级利益的一面，不透过“清”与“邪”的斗争而显露出来种种复杂的其它积极因素，因而得出地主阶级本质是海瑞全部行动的出发点和归宿的结论，就轻轻地一笔对海瑞和“海瑞戏”作了根本的否定，这未必是历史主义的治学态度。
