    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: The spokesman for the Chinese student delegation attending the Executive Committee meeting of the International Student Union in Prague, Czechoslovakia, from December 6th to 15th last year, told Xinhua reporters that at this meeting, the Soviet student delegation and certain leaders of the International Student Union, under the guise of sham anti-imperialism and sham unity, continued to pursue a line of capitulationism and splittism. Chinese student representatives and student representatives from many other countries waged a resolute struggle against this erroneous line.

    The spokesman for the Chinese student delegation said that one of the first issues on which the struggle unfolded at this meeting was whether or not the international student movement should oppose U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the world's people.

    At the beginning of the meeting, the Chinese delegation suggested that the first agenda item, concerning the current situation of the international student movement and the tasks of the International Student Union, should explicitly raise the issue of opposing imperialism headed by the United States. This proposal received enthusiastic support from many delegates. However, a few delegates, including those from the Soviet Union, tried their best to oppose the correct proposal of the Chinese delegation under the pretext of "being broad" and "avoiding repetition." When this proposal was put to a vote, the majority of delegates voted in favor. Under pressure from the masses, the Soviet delegates dared not vote against it and abstained.

    During the discussion on the first agenda item, Wu Shaozu, the head of the Chinese student delegation, pointed out in his speech that the people and students of all countries in the world are now engaged in fierce battles with imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys. Today, whether to oppose or unite with U.S. imperialism has become an important dividing line for testing all political forces. The primary task of the international student movement today is to oppose U.S. imperialism. In his speech, Wu Shaozu warmly praised the many valuable experiences that students from Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Congo (Leopoldville) and other countries have provided to the international student movement in their anti-American struggles. These experiences show that only by combining with the broad masses of workers and peasants and throwing themselves into the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and carrying the struggle against U.S. imperialism through to the end, can the youth and students of all countries fulfill their responsibilities to their nations and peoples and win their own future.

    Many representatives from Asian, African, and Latin American countries also emphasized in their speeches that a tit-for-tat struggle must be waged against U.S. imperialism. Kwon Min-choon, head of the North Korean student delegation, said that in the current situation, the world's progressive student movement must direct the spearhead of its struggle at U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of mankind, and must vigorously support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Fall Mouhtar, head of the delegation of the Union of Black African Students in France, criticized the International Student Union for lacking clear firmness in condemning imperialism, neocolonialism, and old colonialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Yoka Samuel, the representative from Congo (Leopoldville), exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression against Congo (Leopoldville) and its tricks of repeatedly changing puppets in Congo (Leopoldville). He said that from the changes in the situation in Congo (Leopoldville), one can draw the conclusion that the enemy will never retreat or surrender automatically. To win independence, one must fight the enemy more resolutely. Alexi Ricart, the representative from the Dominican Republic, gave a detailed account of the heroic struggle of the Dominican students and people against U.S. imperialism.

    The strong will of students from various countries to oppose U.S. imperialism, as expressed in these speeches, stood in stark contrast to the Soviet representatives' opposition to anti-Americanism at the meeting.

    The spokesman pointed out that another issue on which the struggle unfolded at this meeting was: whether to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, or to support it falsely while opposing it in reality, and to cooperate with U.S. imperialism in its "peace talks" conspiracy?

    Nguyen Ngoc Dung, the representative of the South Vietnamese Student Liberation Union, and Nguyen Van Vy, the representative of the Vietnam Democratic Republic Student Union, strongly condemned the towering crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam in their respective reports on the Vietnam issue at the meeting. They resolutely exposed the Johnson administration's conspiracy to plot "unconditional discussions" on the Vietnam issue, and expressed the determination and firm will of the Vietnamese people and students to resist U.S. aggression and save the country and fight to the end. Their reports were warmly welcomed. Representatives from many countries expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and angrily condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression and the conspiracy of "unconditional discussions."

    In his report on the first agenda item, International Student Union President Walkruglitzki tried his best to exaggerate the horrors of war when analyzing the current situation, saying that the situations in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and the Congo must be analyzed from the perspective of a major war. He also defended, with ulterior motives, the erroneous statement jointly issued by the International Student Union and the World Federation of Democratic Youth in March 1965, which advocated a "peaceful political settlement" of the Vietnam issue in his summary remarks.

    In his speech, Spiridonov, chairman of the Soviet Student Council, boasted about the Soviet Union's so-called "aid" to students of various countries and "support" for the Vietnamese people's struggle, while at the same time defending the crimes committed by the Soviet authorities on March 4, 1965, in Moscow, when they suppressed Chinese, Vietnamese, and other Asian, African, and Latin American students studying in the Soviet Union who were holding anti-American and pro-Vietnamese demonstrations.

    Xu Kui, deputy head of the Chinese student delegation, immediately requested to speak after Spiridonov's speech to provide information about the situation. Xu Kui produced on the spot photos of the Soviet authorities' suppression of students studying in the Soviet Union on March 4 in Moscow, and the suppression of Vietnamese students studying in the Soviet Union who held anti-American rallies in Leningrad on April 3. When Xu Kui began to explain the truth of the matter, the Soviet representatives and their followers, faced with irrefutable evidence, hurriedly adopted anti-democratic methods and forcibly deprived the Chinese representative of the legitimate right to speak. Xu Kui questioned the Soviet representatives: "Is it the anti-American demonstration by students studying in the Soviet Union that is guilty, or is it the Soviet authorities' suppression of students that is guilty?" The Soviet representatives were left speechless.

    The Soviet representatives' unreasonable actions aroused the indignation of the delegates. Student delegations from the West African Student Union, Congo (Leopoldville), Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Union of Black African Students in France, and North Korea all issued statements on the spot expressing regret over this anti-democratic phenomenon. During the recess, many delegates approached the Chinese delegation to learn the truth and eagerly looked at the photos. Some delegates said angrily after seeing the photos, "Everything is clear after seeing the photos. This is simply the same as the capitalist countries suppressing students. This behavior of the Soviet government should be condemned."

    The spokesman pointed out that the third issue on which the struggle unfolded fiercely at this meeting was the line of the International Student Union. As is well known, in recent years, due to the Soviet Student Council leaders' implementation of the Khrushchev revisionist leadership group's will, the traditional anti-imperialist line of the International Student Union has been altered. An erroneous line with "peaceful coexistence" and "complete and thorough disarmament" as the central tasks of the international student movement has been imposed on the International Student Union, thus provoking serious differences between the two lines in the International Student Union and leading the International Student Union astray. This erroneous line has repeatedly gone bankrupt in the struggle practice of students from various countries in recent years, but the Soviet representatives and others at this meeting boasted of their "absolute correctness." When the Chinese representatives listed irrefutable facts to explain the detailed process by which they imposed their erroneous line on the International Student Union, they dared not face these facts and make any response, but instead launched unreasonable attacks and slanders against the Chinese delegation, labeling the Chinese delegation with hats such as "anti-Soviet" and "creating divisions." They also forcibly passed a resolution on the first agenda item, praising and approving all the erroneous actions taken by the International Student Union under their control in recent years. When this resolution was put to a vote, the Chinese delegation voted against it; delegations from North Korea, Vietnam, South Vietnam, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic abstained; and delegations from the Union of Black African Students in France and the West African Student Union declared that they would not participate in the vote.

    At this meeting, in order to seek "cooperation" with the tool manipulated by U.S. imperialism—the International Student Conference—the Soviet representatives and others also forcibly passed an open letter to the International Student Conference. During the discussion of this open letter, representatives from the Union of Black African Students in France, the Union of Students from Portuguese African Colonies, China, the Dominican Republic, North Korea, Vietnam, Venezuela, Congo (Leopoldville), Panama, Cuba, and Haiti all pointed out that it was wrong to cooperate with the reactionary International Student Conference. During the vote, nine delegations, including those from China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Puerto Rico, voted against it. Six delegations, including the Union of Black African Students in France, abstained. The forced passage of this open letter is a good proof of the Soviet student organization leaders' attempt to further promote their line of capitulationism and splittism in the International Student Union.

    The spokesman for the Chinese delegation also pointed out that the Soviet student organization leaders waved their batons and staged ugly dramas of manipulating the meeting, undermining democracy, and opposing China and other anti-imperialist student organizations again and again at this meeting. They did not allow full discussion of the issues in dispute at the meeting, and arbitrarily labeled those who disagreed with their erroneous behavior with various hats. When the Chinese delegation was subjected to their slanders and attacks and requested to make a reply, they forcibly deprived the Chinese delegation of the right to speak several times, and even unreasonably cut off the power to the microphones. These bad practices of theirs aroused great dissatisfaction among the delegates.

### 国际学联执委会上展开两条路线的斗争  亚非拉代表坚持同美帝进行针锋相对斗争  苏联代表暴露了假反帝和假团结的真面目

    国际学联执委会上展开两条路线的斗争
    亚非拉代表坚持同美帝进行针锋相对斗争
    苏联代表暴露了假反帝和假团结的真面目
    据新华社十日讯  出席国际学生联合会执行委员会会议的中国学生代表团发言人向新华社记者发表谈话指出，去年十二月六日到十五日在捷克斯洛伐克举行的这次会议上，苏联学生代表团和国际学联某些领导人在假反帝和假团结的幌子下，继续推行投降主义和分裂主义的路线，中国和许多其他国家的学生代表同这条错误路线进行了坚决的斗争。
    中国学生代表团发言人说，这次会议首先展开斗争的一个问题就是国际学生运动要不要反对世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义。
    会议一开始，中国代表团就建议在有关当前国际学生运动的形势和国际学联的任务的第一项议程的议题中，明确提出反对以美国为首的帝国主义。这一建议获得许多代表的热烈支持。而苏联等少数代表却借口“要广泛”“避免重复”等等，竭力反对中国代表团的正确建议。当表决这一建议时，大多数代表投票赞成，苏联代表迫于群众的压力，不敢投反对票，投了弃权票。
    在会议就第一项议程进行讨论时，中国学生代表团团长伍绍祖发言指出，现在世界各国人民和学生同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗正在进行激烈的搏斗。今天是反对还是联合美帝国主义，已成为检验一切政治力量的重要分界线。国际学生运动当前的首要任务就是反对美帝国主义。伍绍祖在发言中热烈赞扬了越南、多米尼加、刚果（利）等国家的学生在反美斗争中给国际学生运动提供的许多宝贵经验。这些经验说明，各国青年学生只有同广大工农群众结合起来，投身到反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中去，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，才能完成自己对民族和人民所肩负的责任，并争得自己的前途。
    许多亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家的代表在发言中也强调指出，必须同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争。朝鲜学生代表团团长权民淳说，在目前的形势下，世界进步学生运动必须把斗争的矛头指向人类的头号敌人美帝国主义，必须大力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。留法黑非洲学生联合会代表团团长法尔·穆赫塔在发言中批评国际学联在谴责帝国主义、新老殖民主义，特别是美帝国主义的时候缺乏明确的坚定性。刚果（利）代表约卡·萨姆埃尔揭露美帝国主义对刚果（利）的侵略罪行及它在刚果（利）一再调换傀儡的把戏。他说，从刚果（利）局势的变化中可以得出一个结论，敌人永远不会自动退却，自动投降，要争取独立就必须更加坚决地同敌人进行斗争。多米尼加代表阿历克西·里凯拉斯详细介绍了多米尼加学生和人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争。
    这些发言中所表达的各国学生反对美帝国主义的坚强意志，同苏联代表反对反美的态度，在会上形成了鲜明的对照。
    发言人指出，这次会议展开斗争的另一个问题是：是坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，还是假支持，真反对，并配合美帝国主义搞“和谈”阴谋？
    越南南方学生解放联合会代表阮玉蓉和越南民主共和国学生联合会代表阮文维在会上分别作的关于越南问题的报告中，强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行，坚决揭露约翰逊政府策划的“无条件讨论”越南问题的阴谋，并表达了越南人民和学生抗美救国的决心和战斗到底的坚定意志。他们的报告受到热烈的欢迎。很多国家的代表在发言中都表示坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，并且愤怒谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行和“无条件讨论”的阴谋。
    国际学联主席沃克鲁格利茨基在他所作的关于第一项议程的报告中在分析当前形势时，却竭力渲染战争恐怖，说什么必须从一场大战的角度去分析越南、多米尼加、刚果的形势。他还在总结发言中别有用心地为国际学联和世界民主青年联盟一九六五年三月联合发表的一个鼓吹越南问题“和平政治解决”的错误声明辩护。
    苏联大学生理事会主席斯比里多诺夫在发言中，一面大肆吹嘘苏联对各国学生的所谓“援助”和对越南人民斗争的“支持”，但同时又为一九六五年三月四日苏联当局在莫斯科镇压举行反美援越游行的中国、越南和其他亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家留学生的罪行辩护。
    中国学生代表团副团长徐葵在斯比里多诺夫发言后，随即要求作情况发言。徐葵当场拿出苏联当局三月四日在莫斯科镇压留苏学生，四月三日又在列宁格勒镇压举行反美集会的越南留苏学生的照片。在徐葵开始说明事实真相时，苏联代表及其追随者在无可掩饰的罪证面前，慌忙采取反民主的手法，强行剥夺中国代表作情况发言的正当权利。徐葵质问苏联代表：“究竟是留苏学生反美示威游行有罪，还是苏联当局镇压留学生有罪？”苏联代表被问得哑口无言。
    苏联代表这种蛮横无理的作法激起了代表们的义愤，西非洲学生总会、刚果（利）、波多黎各、多米尼加、留法黑非洲学生联合会、朝鲜等学生代表团都当场就此发表声明，对出现这种反民主的现象表示遗憾。休会时，许多代表纷纷向中国代表团了解真相，并争看照片。有些代表看了照片后愤慨地说，“看了照片一切都清楚了，这简直和资本主义国家镇压学生一样。苏联政府这种行为应该受到谴责。”
    发言人指出，这次会议展开激烈斗争的第三个问题就是国际学联的路线问题。众所周知，几年来由于苏联大学生理事会领导人执行赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团的意志，篡改国际学联传统的反帝路线，把一条以“和平共处”和“全面彻底裁军”为国际学生运动中心任务的错误路线强加给国际学联，从而在国际学联中挑起了两条路线的严重分歧，把国际学联引入歧途。这条错误路线几年来在各国学生的斗争实践中已一再遭到破产，但是苏联代表等却在这次会议上，打肿脸充胖子，吹嘘自己“绝对正确”。当中国代表列举无可辩驳的事实，说明他们把自己的错误路线强加于国际学联的详细经过时，他们不敢面对这些事实作出任何回答，而对中国代表团进行无理的攻击和谩骂，给中国代表团扣上“反苏”、“制造分歧”等帽子。他们还强行通过了一个关于第一项议程的决议，对国际学联几年来在他们控制下作出的许多错误行动全部加以赞扬和批准。当就这项决议进行表决时，中国代表团投了反对票；朝鲜、越南、越南南方、厄瓜多尔、多米尼加等代表团投弃权票；留法黑非洲学生联合会和西非洲学生总会等代表团声明不参加投票。
    就在这次会议上，苏联代表等为谋求同美帝国主义操纵的工具——国际学生会议“合作”，还强行通过了一封给国际学生会议的公开信。在讨论这封公开信时，留法黑非洲学生联合会、葡属黑非洲学生联合会、中国、多米尼加、朝鲜、越南、委内瑞拉、刚果（利）、巴拿马、古巴、海地等代表都指出，与反动的国际学生会议搞合作是错误的。在表决时，中国、朝鲜、越南和波多黎各等九个代表团投了反对票。留法黑非洲学生联合会等六个代表团投了弃权票。这封公开信的强行通过，是苏联学生组织领导人企图在国际学联中进一步推行他们的投降主义和分裂主义路线的很好的证明。
    中国代表团发言人还指出，苏联学生组织领导人在这次会议上，挥舞指挥棒，一次又一次地演出了操纵会议，破坏民主反对中国和其他反帝学生组织的丑剧。他们不允许在会议上，就争论的问题进行充分的讨论，任意给不同意他们的错误行为的人扣上各种帽子。当中国代表团受到了他们的诬蔑和攻击，要求进行答辩时，他们几次强行剥夺中国代表团的发言权利，甚至无理地关闭扩音机的电门。他们这些恶劣作法，引起了代表们的极大不满。
