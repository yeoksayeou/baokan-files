    老挝军民粉碎美伪集团对中寮地区旱季进攻
    歼灭敌人七百多　击溃敌人七个营
    新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台十三日广播：美帝国主义和老挝反动集团的军队向中寮地区的解放区发动的旱季进攻，已经遭到失败。
    据初步消息，老挝当地爱国军民从去年十一月到十二月十八日，共歼灭敌人七百零三名，其中打死六百一十八名，打伤四十三名，俘虏四十二名。此外，还击溃了敌人七个营，并且缴获大量武器和军用物资。
    美帝国主义和老挝反动集团从去年十一月以来，曾出动二十多个营的部队，在飞机和大炮的掩护下，在第九、第十号公路和他曲地区，猖狂向中寮地区解放区发起大规模的进攻。当地的爱国军民进行了英勇的反击，给敌人以沉重的打击。
  据新华社康开十二日电　老挝民族团结政府卫生大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉十二日发表呼吁书，号召现在仍然跟随梭发那·富马和贡勒走的原中立力量的官兵们，回到真正和平中立的路线上来，回到一九六○年八月九日政变的旗帜下来，回到爱国队伍和人民的道路上来。
