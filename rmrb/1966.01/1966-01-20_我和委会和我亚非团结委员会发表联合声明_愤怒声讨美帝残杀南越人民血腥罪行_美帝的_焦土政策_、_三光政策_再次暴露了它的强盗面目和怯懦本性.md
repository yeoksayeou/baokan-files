    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch – The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese-African People's Solidarity Committee today issued a joint statement on the recent frenzied intensification by US imperialism of its "scorched earth policy" and "three alls policy" in South Vietnam, and its large-scale use of poison gas and chemical poisons. The statement said that this inhuman and monstrous crime of US imperialism once again exposes its vicious bandit face and also demonstrates the cowardly nature of the American aggressors. The statement expressed full support for the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 14, strongly condemning this new bloody crime of US imperialism.

    The statement said that this new crime of US imperialism is a sharp irony to the Johnson administration's empty talk of peace. It makes it even clearer to all peace-loving and justice-minded people in the world the true face of the Johnson administration's so-called "peace offensive." The statement said, however, some people verbally say a few words of support for Vietnam to put on a show, while at the same time colluding and cozying up with the Johnson administration, and engaging in "joint action" with US military and political bosses to peddle the American "peace talk" fraud. These people have lost even the most basic sense of justice, fully exposing their traitorous faces. How can they even talk about "supporting" the Vietnamese people's struggle? The statement pointed out that their shameful acts of betraying the revolutionary people will inevitably be spurned by all revolutionary people and judged by history.

    我和委会和我亚非团结委员会发表联合声明
    愤怒声讨美帝残杀南越人民血腥罪行
    美帝的“焦土政策”、“三光政策”再次暴露了它的强盗面目和怯懦本性
    新华社十九日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会今天就美帝国主义最近疯狂地加紧在越南南方推行“焦土政策”、“三光政策”，并大规模地使用毒气和化学毒药发表联合声明说，美帝国主义这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，再次暴露了它穷凶极恶的强盗面目，也表明了美国侵略者的怯懦本性。声明表示完全拥护我国外交部于一月十四日强烈谴责美帝国主义这一新的血腥罪行的声明。
    声明说，美帝国主义的这一新的罪行，是对约翰逊政府侈谈和平的尖锐讽刺，它使全世界一切爱好和平和富有正义感的人民更加清楚地认识到约翰逊政府所谓“和平攻势”的真面目。声明说，但是，有些人口头上也说几句支援越南装装样子，同时却和约翰逊政府勾勾搭搭，打得火热，为兜售美国“和谈”骗局同美国的军政头目“联合行动”。这些人连起码的正义感都已丧失殆尽，正好暴露了他们的叛徒面目，那里还谈得上什么“支援”越南人民的斗争。声明指出，他们这种背叛革命人民的可耻行径，必将受到一切革命人民的唾弃和历史的审判。
    声明最后说，中国人民对兄弟的越南人民的处境感同身受。六亿五千万中国人民全心全意支持越南人民的正义斗争，誓为打败美帝国主义作出自己的贡献。
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国越南友好协会，最近也分别打电报或写信给越南和越南南方的有关团体，强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南南方加紧推行灭绝人性的“焦土政策”、“三光政策”以及大规模使用毒气和化学毒药。
