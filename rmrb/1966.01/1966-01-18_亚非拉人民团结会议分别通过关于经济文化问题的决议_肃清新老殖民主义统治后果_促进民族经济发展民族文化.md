    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th – The First Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Conference passed a resolution on economic issues.
    The resolution pointed out: "It is an absolute necessity for the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America to jointly struggle to eliminate imperialism and neo-colonialism, headed by the United States, and to achieve and consolidate their economic liberation." "One of the tasks of the national liberation movement is to eliminate the consequences of imperialism and neo-colonialism, headed by the United States, and their domination in the economic sphere."
    It said, "The economic blockades imposed on the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America by imperialist and neo-colonialist countries constitute a serious threat to their national independence and economic development, and are a constant scourge afflicting the countries of the three continents."
     The resolution said, "Countries that have shaken off the shackles of imperialism and neo-colonialism must rely on self-reliance, that is, maximize the rational utilization of their own economic resources and human resources and materials, supplemented by the effective and rational utilization of assistance provided by the socialist camp and more developed anti-imperialist countries, to develop their national economies." "The economic development of countries that have shaken off the shackles of imperialism and neo-colonialism means fully exploiting their natural resources and implementing industrialization."
    The resolution also "endorses the principle of eliminating exploitation of man by man through a non-capitalist path of development, based on the specific conditions of each country, and further developing towards socialism."
    The resolution believes that "state control of basic natural resources, nationalization of banks and enterprises related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, state control of foreign trade and foreign exchange, and the development of the public sector are important tools in the anti-imperialist struggle and important factors in accelerating economic development to build an independent national economy." "The conference is determined to break the economic blockade imposed by imperialism and neo-colonialism, unite their forces, coordinate and take real economic action, and do everything possible to struggle to defend and consolidate their economic independence, and liberate the masses from all oppression."
    The resolution finally pointed out: "Destroying the old feudal and semi-feudal structures that hinder agricultural development is not only a historical necessity, but also an act of justice for the peasants, and a decisive step in favor of the complete liberation of the countries of the three continents." "Implement genuine land reform to ensure that tillers own their land."
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th – The Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Conference passed the "Draft Report of the Social and Cultural Committee" and eight resolutions.
    These resolutions are: on the cultural and ideological infiltration of imperialism and on the cultivation of national cadres, cultural revolution, technological revolution, scientific and technological wealth, health, social insurance, and sports and art.
    The committee's resolution on the cultural and ideological infiltration of imperialism emphasized: The cultural and ideological infiltration of imperialism, headed by the United States, is taking place in countries still suffering from colonial and imperialist rule and in those that have already achieved national sovereignty, which is always a threat to those carrying out their social revolutions. The cultural and ideological infiltration of imperialism is one of the main weapons of neo-colonialism.
    The resolution revealed that after signing military treaties with the reactionary governments of Latin America, Africa, and Asia, the American imperialists, under the pretext of cultural exchanges and cooperation, established a committee on relations between intellectuals, which is subsidized with large amounts of money through the Ford, Kellogg, Rockefeller, and Kennedy Foundations.
      It emphasized that American imperialism is carrying out extensive sabotage activities through the so-called Peace Corps active in urban and rural areas. American imperialism is attempting to subordinate the university teaching of each country to their suzerain universities, and they are using hateful sociological research programs in order to carry out political, economic, and intellectual espionage.
    Imperialism is importing into many countries of the three continents pornographic publications that distort and slander the people's struggle for their own liberation.
    The resolution said that the Three Continents Conference believes that it is necessary to immediately launch an active struggle to eliminate all forms of imperialism and neo-colonialism, headed by the United States, from national cultural life, while absorbing the best culture in the world and creating and developing national cultures based on the interests of the people.

    亚非拉人民团结会议分别通过关于经济文化问题的决议
    肃清新老殖民主义统治后果  促进民族经济发展民族文化
    新华社哈瓦那十六日电  第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议通过一项关于经济问题的决议。
    这项决议指出：“非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲各国人民为消灭以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、取得和巩固他们的经济解放而共同斗争，是一种绝对的必要”。“民族解放运动的任务之一是，消灭以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义及其在经济领域内的统治的后果。”
    它说，“帝国主义和新老殖民主义国家强加于非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的经济封锁形成对他们的民族独立和经济发展的严重威胁，是经常为害三大洲各国的祸患。”
     决议说，“挣脱了帝国主义和新老殖民主义枷锁的国家必须依靠自力更生，亦即最大限度地合理利用自己的经济资源和人力物力，辅以有效和合理地利用社会主义阵营和较发达的反帝国家给予的援助，来发展民族经济。”“已挣脱帝国主义和新老殖民主义枷锁的国家的经济发展意味着充分开发它们的天然资源和实行工业化。”
    这个决议还“赞成根据每一国家的具体条件通过非资本主义发展道路消灭人剥削人现象以及进一步发展为社会主义的原则。”
    决议认为，“国家控制基本天然资源，把银行和有关国计民生的企业收归国有，国家控制对外贸易和外汇，发展公有部门，是反帝斗争中的重要工具，是加速经济发展以建成独立的民族经济的重要因素。”“会议决心打破帝国主义和新老殖民主义强加的经济封锁，联合他们的力量，协调一致采取一个真正的经济行动，尽一切办法进行斗争，以保卫和巩固他们的经济独立，把人民群众从一切压迫下解放出来。”
    决议最后指出：“摧毁妨碍农业发展的古老的封建和半封建结构，不仅是一种历史的必要，而且是对农民的一种正义行动，也是有利于三大洲各国彻底解放的决定性步骤。”“实行真正的土地改革，实现耕者有其田”。
    新华社哈瓦那十六日电　亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议通过了“社会和文化委员会报告草案”和八个决议。
    这些决议是：关于帝国主义文化与思想渗透以及关于培养民族干部、文化革命、技术革命、科技财富、卫生、社会保险和体育文艺等。
    委员会关于帝国主义的文化与思想渗透的决议强调指出：以美国为首的帝国主义的文化和思想渗透正在仍然遭受殖民和帝国主义统治的国家中以及那些已经取得国家主权的国家中进行，这永远是对那些进行它们的社会革命的国家的一个威胁。帝国主义的文化和思想渗透是新殖民主义的主要武器之一。
    决议揭露说，美国帝国主义者在同拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲的反动政府签订了军事条约后，以文化交流和合作的借口，建立了一个关于知识分子之间的关系的委员会，这个委员会通过福特、凯洛格、洛克菲勒和肯尼迪基金会得到大量金钱的津贴。
      它强调指出，美国帝国主义正通过在城乡活动的所谓和平队进行广泛的破坏活动。美国帝国主义正企图使每个国家的大学教学隶属于他们的宗主国大学，他们利用可恨的社会学研究计划，以便进行政治、经济和知识的间谍活动。
    帝国主义正把歪曲和诽谤人民争取自身解放的斗争的色情刊物输入三大洲许多国家。
    决议说，三大洲会议认为，必须立即进行一场积极的斗争以便把以美国为首的各种形式的帝国主义和新老殖民主义从民族文化生活中清除掉，同时吸收世界上最优良的文化，创造和发展建立在人民利益基础上的民族文化。
