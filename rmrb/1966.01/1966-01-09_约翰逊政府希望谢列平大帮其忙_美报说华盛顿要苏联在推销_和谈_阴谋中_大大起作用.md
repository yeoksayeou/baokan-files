    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th – Following the Soviet Union's announcement that it would send a delegation led by Shelepin to visit Vietnam, the American side expressed great interest and hoped that Shelepin's trip would help the United States promote its "peace talk" conspiracy.

    After the news of Shelepin's visit was announced on December 28, the Associated Press reported from Washington on December 30 that "Washington is very interested in the timing of Shelepin's visit to Hanoi." Some American newspapers and periodicals pointed out that on December 22 of last year, the US ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kohler, told the Soviet Union that "the United States may suspend bombing." On December 24, the same day the United States began its "suspension of bombing," Kohler met again with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov. On December 28, the day after the Johnson administration announced its fourteen-point plan, the Soviet Union announced Shelepin's visit to Vietnam.

    According to Roberts, a Washington-based special correspondent for the *New York Herald Tribune*, on the 5th, in the contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union, "the Soviet Union told the United States that if the United States suspends bombing of North Vietnam, the Soviet Union will send a delegation to Hanoi." The reporter also reported that after the United States "suspended bombing," "Moscow announced that Shelepin would leave 'soon,' and then revised it to say that he would leave on January 6. This delay had caused some anxiety in Washington, but the American president expressed his willingness to keep the bombing suspension in effect at least until Shelepin completed his trip to North Vietnam."

    Reports in the Western press indicate that the US government is "very interested" in Shelepin's visit because the US expects the visit to be a "key factor" in promoting its "peace offensive." Reuters reporter Heffernan reported from Washington on the 6th that "US officials said privately tonight that one of the purposes of the high-level Soviet delegation to North Vietnam is to persuade Hanoi to listen to the Johnson administration's peace proposals," and hoped "he will use the strength of the Soviet Union to...put pressure on North Vietnam to listen to opinions."

    *New York Herald Tribune* reporter Roberts also reported on the 5th that the United States "hopes the Russians will try, through Shelepin's mission and other means, to persuade Hanoi that it is best to move the conflict from the battlefield to the negotiating table." The US government also hopes that Shelepin's visit will become a "decisive factor in persuading Hanoi to accept a meeting."

    A commentary by Evans and Novak published in the *New York Herald Tribune* on the 3rd more bluntly stated that "If anything will bring North Vietnam to the negotiating table to negotiate, it will not be the long-term suspension of bombing of North Vietnam by the United States, nor the senior diplomats sent by the United States to various parts of the world, but Shelepin's trip from Moscow."

    An article in the *Chicago Sun-Times* on the 3rd called for the Soviet Union to "play a major role in seeking peace." The article also said, "Johnson will certainly make various temptations to encourage the Soviets to use their influence."

    A Washington report published in the British *Times* on the 4th pointed out that the United States hopes to cooperate with the Soviet Union while Shelepin is visiting Vietnam to "get the situation under control." The newspaper also said that Moscow's "provision of more military and economic assistance to Vietnam would not necessarily be considered a hostile act, if doing so could increase Soviet influence to the detriment of China's bellicose attitude."

### 约翰逊政府希望谢列平大帮其忙  美报说华盛顿要苏联在推销“和谈”阴谋中“大大起作用”

    约翰逊政府希望谢列平大帮其忙
    美报说华盛顿要苏联在推销“和谈”阴谋中“大大起作用”
    新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：在苏联宣布派出谢列平率领的苏联代表团访问越南后，美国方面表示很大兴趣，并且希望谢列平之行将有助于美国推行它的“和谈”阴谋。
    在谢列平出访的消息在十二月二十八日宣布后，美联社十二月三十日从华盛顿发出消息说，“华盛顿对谢列平访问河内的时机很感兴趣”。美国一些报刊指出，去年十二月二十二日，美国驻苏联大使科勒曾经告诉苏联，“美国可能暂停轰炸”。十二月二十四日，在美国开始“暂停轰炸”的同一天，科勒又会见了苏联副外长库兹涅佐夫。十二月二十八日，在约翰逊政府公布它的十四点计划后的第二天，苏联就宣布了谢列平访问越南。
    据《纽约先驱论坛报》驻华盛顿特派记者罗伯茨五日透露，在美苏两国的接触中，“苏联告诉美国说，如果美国暂停轰炸北越，苏联将派一个代表团到河内去。”这位记者还报道说，美国在“暂停轰炸”后，“莫斯科宣布说，谢列平‘不久’就将动身，随后又修正说，他将在一月六日动身。这种推迟曾经使华盛顿产生某种焦急情绪，但是美国总统表示准备使暂停轰炸至少生效到谢列平完成他的北越之行时为止”。
    西方报刊的报道表明，美国政府对谢列平之行“很感兴趣”，这是因为美国期望这次访问将成为推行它的“和平攻势”的一个“关键性因素”。路透社记者赫弗南六日从华盛顿发出的消息说，“美国官员今晚私下表示希望，苏联赴北越的高级代表团的目的之一，是说服河内倾听约翰逊政府的和谈建议”，并希望“他会以苏联的力量支持……对北越施加压力使它听取意见”。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》记者罗伯茨五日还报道说，美国“希望俄国人将通过谢列平的使命和其他办法设法劝说河内：它最好把冲突从战场移到会议桌上来”。美国政府还希望谢列平的访问将成为“说服河内接受一个会议的决定性因素”。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》三日刊载的伊文斯和诺瓦克写的一篇评论更露骨地说，“如果有任何事情将使北越到会议桌旁来进行谈判的话，那将不是美国对北越实行的长时间的暂停轰炸，也不是美国向世界各地派遣的高级外交人员，而是从莫斯科去的谢列平之行。”
    《芝加哥太阳时报》三日刊载的一篇文章要苏联“在谋求和平中要大大起作用”。文章还说，“约翰逊肯定将作出各种诱惑来鼓励苏联人运用他们的影响。”
    英国《泰晤士报》四日刊载的一篇华盛顿报道指出，美国希望趁谢列平访问越南的时机同苏联配合，“使局势得到控制。”这家报纸还说，莫斯科对越南“提供更多的军事和经济援助将不一定被认为是一种敌对行动，如果这样做可以在不利于中国的好战态度的情况下使苏联的影响增加的话”。
