    For more than ten years, under the leadership of the Party committee and with the help of higher-level cultural organs, professional groups, and newspapers and periodicals, our factory has gradually formed a mass-based amateur writing team. Currently, there are more than 120 active members in literary and artistic creation throughout the factory. Most of these amateur authors have good ideology and work hard, and they can closely connect with the masses; many of them are also the backbone of production and mass work. Over the past ten years, we have published more than 500 poems, features, essays, ballads, and songs in national and municipal newspapers and periodicals. From 1963 to the present, more than 700 literary and artistic submissions have been published on the factory's "Outpost" blackboard newspaper, and more than 250 literary and artistic programs have been written and performed by ourselves.
    Through more than ten years of practice, we have deeply realized that once the working class is armed with Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, it can become the master of the new culture. Not only can they write, but they can also write well; not only can a few people write, but they can also form a mass-based writing activity.
    Our factory's development of mass amateur literary and artistic creation activities has mainly focused on the following aspects:
    I. Focus on the Team: Combining mobilizing the masses and cultivating backbone.
    Under the leadership of the Party committee, the factory's trade union, Communist Youth League committee, and workshop Party and League branches all pay attention to amateur literary and artistic creation at every level. On the basis of extensively mobilizing the masses to carry out literary and artistic creation, we discover and cultivate backbone forces to promote the continuous development of amateur literary and artistic creation activities.
      1. Select good "seedlings" and cultivate "top talents."
    A large number of propagandists and active members of literary and artistic creation are spread throughout the factory workshops. Under the leadership of the Party and League branches and the trade union organizations, they form propaganda groups and literary and artistic creation groups. According to the requirements of the central tasks and production competitions, they carry out various propaganda work and literary and artistic creation activities. In each period of political movement, we pay attention to extensively mobilizing the masses to promote propaganda work and literary and artistic creation activities through performances or contests. This not only stimulates the creative enthusiasm of more people and produces a large number of literary and artistic works, but also provides conditions for us to discover "seedlings" and cultivate "top talents." Worker poet Li Xue'ao and worker composer Xia Baosen were discovered in this way and grew up under the Party's kind care and enthusiastic cultivation.
      2. Organize active members through the backbone.
    With the development of mass amateur literary and artistic creation activities, some "new seedlings" continue to emerge. The Party committee pays attention to giving play to the "little teacher" role of "top talents," allowing them to help "new seedlings" grow. In recent years, Li Xue'ao, Xia Baosen, and Gao Zhanxiang, among others, have brought up some new literary and artistic creation backbone and active members through the method of "helping with ideology, leading in creation, and passing on experience." These new backbone members also play the role of "little teachers" in the workshops, uniting and organizing a group of active members in literary and artistic creation activities.
    3. Motivate the masses through active members.
    Numerous amateur literary and artistic enthusiasts are distributed in workshops, teams, and machine stations. They produce, live, fight, and study with the workers every day, understand the masses' thoughts and feelings, and are familiar with the masses' language. Under the help and impetus of active members, they use the countless new people, new things, and new ideas around them as themes for literary and artistic creation and performance activities. Some write poems on wall newspapers, some sing songs in groups, and some tell quick stories at pre-shift meetings, actively playing a role in propaganda and mobilization. Although some people's initial drafts are written in a way that is "neither poetry nor prose, not smooth, and does not rhyme;" the first time on stage they "feel dizzy, eyes blurred, heart flustered, and legs trembling," however, with the support of the leadership and the help of active members, they are encouraged to be "dare" first, do it with them, "one time strange, two times familiar," and after a period of training, after becoming familiar with one or two forms of literature and art, their confidence is sufficient.
    II. Focus on Ideology: "One Establishment, Three Preventions, Two Balances."
    The Party committee of our factory attaches great importance to the ideological work of the literary and artistic creation team. We require everyone to "be a revolutionary person, write revolutionary articles, sing revolutionary songs, and perform revolutionary dramas." According to the instructions of the Party committee, the focus of our work is: Focusing on the fundamental question of "why create," grasping living thoughts, organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works, and promoting the revolutionization of the amateur creation team.
    1. Establish the idea of creating for the revolution.
    Some amateur authors have impure motives and unclear goals in writing. The main methods we take to solve these ideological problems are "study," "speak," and "establish." That is, to organize them to study Chairman Mao's works in response to living thoughts, repeatedly explain the truth of creating for the revolution, establish banners, and commend advanced examples. For example, young worker Wu Nianxiang initially liked quyi (folk art forms) in order to "have fun, relax and relieve boredom," and pursued bizarre and strange forms, thinking that it was "tasty." After we discovered this, we enlightened him to study "Against Party Stereotypes," which made him realize that "his pursuit of bizarre and strange things is like writing '工' as '?', which is intentionally showing off and making it difficult for people to understand." He said: "To serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must first revolutionize ourselves. The factory's amateur authors can only write about their own lives, work, and struggles in forms that the worker comrades like to take effect and be welcomed." After his ideology improved, his enthusiasm came. He visited many old workers in depth and wrote "Praising the Master," which was very popular among the masses. Wu Nianxiang tasted the sweetness, and became more and more enthusiastic about studying Mao Zedong's works. He became an "active member of studying Mao Zedong's works," a five-good worker, and the backbone of literary and artistic creation. In recent years, he has written more than 20 performance materials in coordination with central tasks and production activities.
      2. Prevent the encroachment of bourgeois ideology.
    The struggle between bourgeois and proletarian ideology is bound to be reflected in the amateur literary and artistic creation team. In order to give play to the combat role of this team and prevent the poison of bourgeois fame, profit, pride, and special treatment, the main methods we take are: "Guiding the study of Mao Zedong's works to enhance antitoxins; finding them to talk to and give vaccinations; individually naming names to sound the alarm for the majority." The ideological problems of amateur authors must be grasped "early" and "at the root." "Early" means observing the signs and preventing problems before they occur. "Root" means fundamentally explaining the harmfulness of bourgeois fame, profit, pride, and special treatment. Let them realize that they must carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in literary and artistic creation, and adhere to the direction of creating for the revolution. Tell them: "Personal fame and profit are the 'little tigers' in the mind, if you raise them, they will eat you."
    3. Balance the two relationships of "work and spare time" and "inside and outside."
    In the relationship between "work" and "spare time," we emphasize that amateur authors must first work well and work hard. For example, Gao Changfu was very active in propaganda work. In addition to being responsible for running the workshop blackboard newspaper, he also frequently wrote articles for the "Zhong Sheng Bao." However, for a period of time, his technical studies were poor, and his production tasks were not well completed, and he often made mistakes. The Party branch then said to him: "We are publicizing good people and good deeds, but we are not doing very well ourselves. How can we promote to others?"
    In the relationship between "inside" and "outside," there are ideological problems and cognitive problems. Some amateur authors only write for newspapers and periodicals, not for the workshop and the factory; others are afraid that people will say that he is external and not internal, and he has concerns when writing for newspapers and periodicals. In response to this phenomenon, we repeatedly explain the truth to them, help them correct their attitude, and clarify the direction, so that they realize that amateur creation should first face the masses of their own unit and become a propaganda tool of the Party; at the same time, let them also clarify: "Newspapers and magazines are more important propaganda tools, and articles published on them have a greater impact. Therefore, we must be more serious and responsible when writing articles." Writing for the factory and the workshop is the foundation of good creation. Do not antagonize "inside" and "outside." Encourage everyone to write more articles for newspapers and periodicals on the basis of doing a good job in propaganda work in the factory and workshop.
    III. Focus on Creation: Speaking on the Situation, Setting Topics, and Opening up Gardens.
    Whenever there is a major political movement or central task, we generally convene a conference of propaganda backbone and active members of literary and artistic creation before mobilizing all the factory workers. We talk about the situation, assign tasks, and specifically arrange creation topics. Over time, this has cultivated a good habit among the majority of amateur authors of closely following and quickly following political movements and central tasks. They said: "Whenever major events happen at home and abroad, if we don't write something, we feel that we haven't fulfilled our responsibilities, and we can't eat or sleep." For example, during the anti-Rightist struggle, they wrote "The Rudder is in Our Hands," "The Scorpion's Tail and Others," and "Nan Batian's Dream"; when the US imperialism provoked in the Taiwan Strait, they wrote "Rage"; after the communique of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was released, they wrote "Always Standing at the Forefront of Socialist Construction."
    The Party committee often educates amateur authors to be in the workshop, to have a global perspective, to care about the international situation, and to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Whenever a major international event occurs, they move with the wind, read newspapers, listen to the radio, and write articles. For example, when US imperialism invaded Congo (Leopoldville), they wrote "Spring Thunder Roars on the Banks of the Congo River"; when the people of Panama launched an anti-US storm, they wrote "The People of Panama are Doing Well"; in the struggle to aid Vietnam against the US, they wrote "The Final Victory Belongs to Vietnam," etc.
    In order to promote the development of amateur literary and artistic creation activities, we also pay attention to opening up gardens for literary and artistic creation, so that their works can meet the masses in a timely manner, listen to the opinions and reactions of the masses, and improve the writing level of amateur authors through creative practice. In addition to the blackboard newspapers in factories, workshops, and work sections, the factory has also run mimeographed or letterpress publications such as "Democratization Movement Special Issue," "New Printing Workers," "Rectification Fast Report," "Zhong Sheng Bao," and "Club." These publications all have literary and artistic columns to publish literary and artistic submissions, which have played a certain role in promoting amateur literary and artistic creation activities.

    坚持群众业余文艺创作活动的点滴体会
    北京人民印刷厂政治部宣传科
    十多年来，在党委的领导下，在上级文化机关、专业团体和报刊的帮助下，我们厂逐步形成了一支群众性的业余创作队伍。目前，全厂有一百二十多名文艺创作积极分子。这些业余作者，大多数思想好，劳动好，能密切联系群众；其中许多人又是生产和群众工作的骨干。十几年来，我们在全国和市的报刊上发表了诗歌、特写、散文、曲艺和歌曲等作品五百多篇。一九六三年到现在，发表在本厂“前哨”黑板报上的文艺稿件就有七百余篇，自编自演的文艺节目二百五十多个。
    通过十几年的实践，我们深深体会到，工人阶级一旦用毛泽东文艺思想武装起来，就能够成为新文化的主人。不仅能够写，而且能够写得好；不仅少数人能够写，而且能够形成群众性的写作活动。
    我厂开展群众性的业余文艺创作活动，主要抓了以下几方面的工作：
    一、抓队伍：发动群众和培养骨干相结合。
    在党委的领导下，厂工会、团委会、车间党支部、团支部，层层都注意抓业余文艺创作。在广泛发动群众开展文艺创作的基础上，发现和培养骨干，形成一支积极分子队伍，推动业余文艺创作活动的不断开展。
      1、选好“苗子”，培养“尖子”。
    广大的宣传员和文艺创作积极分子遍布全厂各个车间。他们在党团支部和工会组织的领导下，组成了宣传小组和文艺创作小组。根据中心工作和生产竞赛的要求，开展各种各样的宣传工作和文艺创作活动。我们在每个时期的政治运动中，注意广泛发动群众，通过会演或比武等形式，推动宣传工作和文艺创作活动。这样，不仅激发了更多人的创作热情，写出了大量的文艺作品，也为我们发现“苗子”，培养“尖子”提供了条件。工人诗人李学鳌、工人作曲家夏宝森等就是这样发现出来，在党的亲切关怀和热情培养下成长起来的。
      2、通过骨干组织积极分子队伍。
    随着群众业余文艺创作活动的开展，不断涌现出一些“新苗”。党委注意发挥“尖子”的“小教师”作用，让他们帮助“新苗”成长。几年来，李学鳌、夏宝森和高占祥等，通过“帮思想、带创作、传经验”的办法，都带起来一些新的文艺创作骨干和积极分子。这些新骨干又在车间里起“小教师”的作用，团结组织了一批文艺积极分子，进行文艺创作活动。
    3、通过积极分子去带动群众。
    众多的业余文艺爱好者分布在车间、班组、机台。他们每天和工人群众生产、生活、战斗、学习在一起，了解群众的思想感情，熟悉群众的语言。他们在积极分子的帮助和带动下，以身边数不尽的新人、新事、新思想为题材，进行文艺创作和演唱活动。有的在墙报上写诗歌，有的在小组里唱歌曲，有的在班前会上说快板，积极地起着宣传鼓动作用。虽然有些人初次写稿写得“诗不诗，文不文，不顺口，不压韵”；初次登台“头发晕，眼发花，心发慌，腿打颤”，但是，有领导的支持，有积极分子的帮助，鼓励他们“敢”字当头，带着他们干，“一回生，两回熟”，经过一段锻炼，熟悉了一两种文艺形式后，信心也就足了。
    二、抓思想：“一树、三防、两摆”。
    我们厂党委很重视文艺创作队伍的思想工作。要求大家“当革命人，写革命文，唱革命歌，演革命戏”。根据党委的指示精神，我们的工作重点是：围绕“为什么而创作”这个根本问题，抓活思想，组织学习毛主席著作，促使业余创作队伍的革命化。
    1、树立为革命而创作的思想。
    有些业余作者写作的动机不纯，目的不明确。我们解决这些思想问题采取的主要办法是“学”、
  “讲”、“树”。就是针对活思想组织他们学习毛主席著作，反复讲明为革命而创作的道理，树立旗帜，表扬先进。如青年工人武念祥，起初爱好曲艺是为了“玩玩乐乐，消遣解闷”，追求离奇古怪的形式，认为那样“才有味道”。我们发现了以后，便启发他学习了《反对党八股》，使他认识到“自己追求离奇古怪的东西，正象把‘工’写成‘?’一样，是有意炫耀自己，使人听不懂”。他说：“要为工农兵服务，首先要革自己的命，工厂的业余作者只有用工人同志们喜欢的形式，写他们自己的生活、工作和斗争才能起作用、受欢迎。”思想提高以后，积极性就来了，他深入访问了许多老工人，写了《夸师傅》，很受群众的欢迎。武念祥尝到了甜头，学习毛主席著作越学越起劲，成了“学习毛主席著作的积极分子”、五好职工和文艺创作的骨干。几年来，他配合中心工作和生产活动，写了二十多篇演唱材料。
      2、防止资产阶级思想侵害。
    资产阶级和无产阶级两种思想的斗争，也必然反映到业余文艺创作队伍中来。为了发挥这支队伍的战斗作用，防止资产阶级名利、骄傲和特殊化思想的毒害，我们采取的主要办法是：“引导学毛主席著作，增强抗毒素；找来谈谈心，打打防疫针；个别点点名，为多数敲警钟”。对业余作者的思想问题要抓“早”、抓“根”。“早”就是观察苗头，防患于未然。“根”就是从根本上讲清资产阶级名利、骄傲、特殊化思想的危害性。让他们认识到：在文艺创作上必须进行兴无灭资的斗争，坚持为革命而创作的方向。告诉他们：“个人名利是思想里的‘小老虎’，把它养大了，会把自己吃掉。”
    3、摆好“业和余”“里和外”两个关系。
    在“业”和“余”的关系上，我们强调业余作者首先必须工作好，劳动好。例如，高长福搞宣传工作很积极，除负责办车间黑板报外，还经常给《钟声报》写稿。但是，有一个时期他的技术学习差，生产任务完成的不好，常出差错。党支部便对他说：“咱们宣传的是好人好事，可是自己做的不太好，怎么向人家宣传呢？”
    在“里”和“外”的关系上，有思想问题，也有认识问题。有的业余作者只为报刊写稿，不为车间和本厂写稿；也有的怕人家说他对外不对内，为报刊写稿时有顾虑。对这种现象，我们反复向他们讲清道理，帮助他们端正态度，明确方向，让他们认识到业余创作首先要面向本单位的群众，成为党的宣传工具；同时也让他们明确：“报纸、刊物是更重要的宣传工具，稿件登在上面影响更大。因此，写稿时更要认真负责”。为本厂、为车间写稿是创作好的基础。不要把“里”和“外”对立起来。鼓励大家在搞好本厂和车间宣传工作的基础上，多为报刊写稿。
    三、抓创作：讲形势、出题目、辟园地。
    每逢重大的政治运动或中心任务，我们一般都在向全厂职工动员之前，召开宣传骨干和文艺创作积极分子大会。讲形势、交任务、具体地安排创作题目。长期如此，使广大业余作者养成了一种对政治运动和中心工作跟得紧，跟得快的好习惯。他们说：“每当国内外发生了大事，不写点东西，就觉得没尽到责任，吃不下、睡不着”。如，在反右派斗争时，他们写了《舵轮在我们手中》、《蝎子的尾巴及其他》和《南霸天的梦》；美帝在台湾海峡挑衅时，写了《怒火万丈》；党的八届十中全会公报发表以后，写了《永远站在社会主义建设最前线》。
    党委经常教育业余作者，要身在车间，放眼世界，关心国际形势，支持世界人民的革命斗争。每逢发生一件国际大事，他们便闻风而动，看报纸、听广播、写稿子。如，美帝入侵刚果（利）时，写了《刚果河畔春雷吼》；巴拿马人民掀起反美风暴时，写了《巴拿马人民干得好》；在援越抗美斗争中，写了《最后的胜利属于越南》等。
    为了促进业余文艺创作活动的开展，我们还注意开辟文艺创作园地，使他们的作品及时和群众见面，听取群众的意见和反映，通过创作实践、提高业余作者的写作水平。除了工厂、车间和工段都设有黑板报以外，厂内还办过《民主化运动专刊》、《新印工》、《整风快报》、《钟声报》和《俱乐部》等油印或铅印刊物。这些刊物都辟有文艺专栏，刊登文艺稿件。对促进业余文艺创作活动，起了一定的作用。
