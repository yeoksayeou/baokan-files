    For more than ten years, under the leadership of the Party committee and with the help of higher-level cultural organs, professional groups, and newspapers and periodicals, our factory has gradually formed a mass-based amateur writing team. Currently, there are more than 120 active members in literary and artistic creation throughout the factory. Most of these amateur authors have good ideology and work hard, and they can closely connect with the masses; many of them are also the backbone of production and mass work. Over the past ten years, we have published more than 500 poems, features, essays, ballads, and songs in national and municipal newspapers and periodicals. From 1963 to the present, more than 700 literary and artistic submissions have been published on the factory's "Outpost" blackboard newspaper, and more than 250 literary and artistic programs have been written and performed by ourselves.
    Through more than ten years of practice, we have deeply realized that once the working class is armed with Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, it can become the master of the new culture. Not only can they write, but they can also write well; not only can a few people write, but they can also form a mass-based writing activity.
    Our factory's development of mass amateur literary and artistic creation activities has mainly focused on the following aspects:
    I. Focus on the Team: Combining mobilizing the masses and cultivating backbone.
    Under the leadership of the Party committee, the factory's trade union, Communist Youth League committee, and workshop Party and League branches all pay attention to amateur literary and artistic creation at every level. On the basis of extensively mobilizing the masses to carry out literary and artistic creation, we discover and cultivate backbone forces to promote the continuous development of amateur literary and artistic creation activities.
      1. Select good "seedlings" and cultivate "top talents."
    A large number of propagandists and active members of literary and artistic creation are spread throughout the factory workshops. Under the leadership of the Party and League branches and the trade union organizations, they form propaganda groups and literary and artistic creation groups. According to the requirements of the central tasks and production competitions, they carry out various propaganda work and literary and artistic creation activities. In each period of political movement, we pay attention to extensively mobilizing the masses to promote propaganda work and literary and artistic creation activities through performances or contests. This not only stimulates the creative enthusiasm of more people and produces a large number of literary and artistic works, but also provides conditions for us to discover "seedlings" and cultivate "top talents." Worker poet Li Xue'ao and worker composer Xia Baosen were discovered in this way and grew up under the Party's kind care and enthusiastic cultivation.
      2. Organize active members through the backbone.
    With the development of mass amateur literary and artistic creation activities, some "new seedlings" continue to emerge. The Party committee pays attention to giving play to the "little teacher" role of "top talents," allowing them to help "new seedlings" grow. In recent years, Li Xue'ao, Xia Baosen, and Gao Zhanxiang, among others, have brought up some new literary and artistic creation backbone and active members through the method of "helping with ideology, leading in creation, and passing on experience." These new backbone members also play the role of "little teachers" in the workshops, uniting and organizing a group of active members in literary and artistic creation activities.
    3. Motivate the masses through active members.
    Numerous amateur literary and artistic enthusiasts are distributed in workshops, teams, and machine stations. They produce, live, fight, and study with the workers every day, understand the masses' thoughts and feelings, and are familiar with the masses' language. Under the help and impetus of active members, they use the countless new people, new things, and new ideas around them as themes for literary and artistic creation and performance activities. Some write poems on wall newspapers, some sing songs in groups, and some tell quick stories at pre-shift meetings, actively playing a role in propaganda and mobilization. Although some people's initial drafts are written in a way that is "neither poetry nor prose, not smooth, and does not rhyme;" the first time on stage they "feel dizzy, eyes blurred, heart flustered, and legs trembling," however, with the support of the leadership and the help of active members, they are encouraged to be "dare" first, do it with them, "one time strange, two times familiar," and after a period of training, after becoming familiar with one or two forms of literature and art, their confidence is sufficient.
    II. Focus on Ideology: "One Establishment, Three Preventions, Two Balances."
    The Party committee of our factory attaches great importance to the ideological work of the literary and artistic creation team. We require everyone to "be a revolutionary person, write revolutionary articles, sing revolutionary songs, and perform revolutionary dramas." According to the instructions of the Party committee, the focus of our work is: Focusing on the fundamental question of "why create," grasping living thoughts, organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works, and promoting the revolutionization of the amateur creation team.
    1. Establish the idea of creating for the revolution.
    Some amateur authors have impure motives and unclear goals in writing. The main methods we take to solve these ideological problems are "study," "speak," and "establish." That is, to organize them to study Chairman Mao's works in response to living thoughts, repeatedly explain the truth of creating for the revolution, establish banners, and commend advanced examples. For example, young worker Wu Nianxiang initially liked quyi (folk art forms) in order to "have fun, relax and relieve boredom," and pursued bizarre and strange forms, thinking that it was "tasty." After we discovered this, we enlightened him to study "Against Party Stereotypes," which made him realize that "his pursuit of bizarre and strange things is like writing 'å·¥' as '?', which is intentionally showing off and making it difficult for people to understand." He said: "To serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must first revolutionize ourselves. The factory's amateur authors can only write about their own lives, work, and struggles in forms that the worker comrades like to take effect and be welcomed." After his ideology improved, his enthusiasm came. He visited many old workers in depth and wrote "Praising the Master," which was very popular among the masses. Wu Nianxiang tasted the sweetness, and became more and more enthusiastic about studying Mao Zedong's works. He became an "active member of studying Mao Zedong's works," a five-good worker, and the backbone of literary and artistic creation. In recent years, he has written more than 20 performance materials in coordination with central tasks and production activities.
      2. Prevent the encroachment of bourgeois ideology.
    The struggle between bourgeois and proletarian ideology is bound to be reflected in the amateur literary and artistic creation team. In order to give play to the combat role of this team and prevent the poison of bourgeois fame, profit, pride, and special treatment, the main methods we take are: "Guiding the study of Mao Zedong's works to enhance antitoxins; finding them to talk to and give vaccinations; individually naming names to sound the alarm for the majority." The ideological problems of amateur authors must be grasped "early" and "at the root." "Early" means observing the signs and preventing problems before they occur. "Root" means fundamentally explaining the harmfulness of bourgeois fame, profit, pride, and special treatment. Let them realize that they must carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in literary and artistic creation, and adhere to the direction of creating for the revolution. Tell them: "Personal fame and profit are the 'little tigers' in the mind, if you raise them, they will eat you."
    3. Balance the two relationships of "work and spare time" and "inside and outside."
    In the relationship between "work" and "spare time," we emphasize that amateur authors must first work well and work hard. For example, Gao Changfu was very active in propaganda work. In addition to being responsible for running the workshop blackboard newspaper, he also frequently wrote articles for the "Zhong Sheng Bao." However, for a period of time, his technical studies were poor, and his production tasks were not well completed, and he often made mistakes. The Party branch then said to him: "We are publicizing good people and good deeds, but we are not doing very well ourselves. How can we promote to others?"
    In the relationship between "inside" and "outside," there are ideological problems and cognitive problems. Some amateur authors only write for newspapers and periodicals, not for the workshop and the factory; others are afraid that people will say that he is external and not internal, and he has concerns when writing for newspapers and periodicals. In response to this phenomenon, we repeatedly explain the truth to them, help them correct their attitude, and clarify the direction, so that they realize that amateur creation should first face the masses of their own unit and become a propaganda tool of the Party; at the same time, let them also clarify: "Newspapers and magazines are more important propaganda tools, and articles published on them have a greater impact. Therefore, we must be more serious and responsible when writing articles." Writing for the factory and the workshop is the foundation of good creation. Do not antagonize "inside" and "outside." Encourage everyone to write more articles for newspapers and periodicals on the basis of doing a good job in propaganda work in the factory and workshop.
    III. Focus on Creation: Speaking on the Situation, Setting Topics, and Opening up Gardens.
    Whenever there is a major political movement or central task, we generally convene a conference of propaganda backbone and active members of literary and artistic creation before mobilizing all the factory workers. We talk about the situation, assign tasks, and specifically arrange creation topics. Over time, this has cultivated a good habit among the majority of amateur authors of closely following and quickly following political movements and central tasks. They said: "Whenever major events happen at home and abroad, if we don't write something, we feel that we haven't fulfilled our responsibilities, and we can't eat or sleep." For example, during the anti-Rightist struggle, they wrote "The Rudder is in Our Hands," "The Scorpion's Tail and Others," and "Nan Batian's Dream"; when the US imperialism provoked in the Taiwan Strait, they wrote "Rage"; after the communique of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was released, they wrote "Always Standing at the Forefront of Socialist Construction."
    The Party committee often educates amateur authors to be in the workshop, to have a global perspective, to care about the international situation, and to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Whenever a major international event occurs, they move with the wind, read newspapers, listen to the radio, and write articles. For example, when US imperialism invaded Congo (Leopoldville), they wrote "Spring Thunder Roars on the Banks of the Congo River"; when the people of Panama launched an anti-US storm, they wrote "The People of Panama are Doing Well"; in the struggle to aid Vietnam against the US, they wrote "The Final Victory Belongs to Vietnam," etc.
    In order to promote the development of amateur literary and artistic creation activities, we also pay attention to opening up gardens for literary and artistic creation, so that their works can meet the masses in a timely manner, listen to the opinions and reactions of the masses, and improve the writing level of amateur authors through creative practice. In addition to the blackboard newspapers in factories, workshops, and work sections, the factory has also run mimeographed or letterpress publications such as "Democratization Movement Special Issue," "New Printing Workers," "Rectification Fast Report," "Zhong Sheng Bao," and "Club." These publications all have literary and artistic columns to publish literary and artistic submissions, which have played a certain role in promoting amateur literary and artistic creation activities.
