    A Difficult Journey
    Hong Xiannü

    From responding to the Party's call to perform revolutionary modern dramas to playing the role of Liu Qin in "Mountain Village Storm," I have experienced a difficult journey in terms of both ideological understanding and artistic practice. This is a process of gradually training and transforming myself, and improving my ideological understanding and acting skills, under the leadership's support and with the help of comrades.

    In the past, I also performed some plays with modern themes, but because my understanding of the significance of performing modern dramas was superficial at the time, I did not realize that whether or not to perform revolutionary modern dramas was a matter of political orientation—serving socialism or serving capitalism and feudalism; a major issue of right and wrong—standing on the side of the proletariat and working people or standing on the side of the bourgeoisie and feudal forces, taking the socialist road or taking the capitalist road. Therefore, at that time, I regarded the creation of characters in modern dramas as merely an artistic issue. Although I also admitted at that time that it was necessary to go deep into life and among the masses, and I had already begun to do so, what I thought of at that time was only to understand the characters and become familiar with them, so as to shape the characters in modern dramas more "lifelike" and avoid acting out of shape. I had not yet realized that going deep into life should be linked to the fundamental requirement of ideological remolding. Although, when performing some revolutionary heroes (such as Liu Hulan), I myself was also educated ideologically and felt that it was of great help in improving my political and ideological awareness, and I also hoped to perform more modern dramas. However, it was just such a wish.

    At the end of 1963, I was once full of enthusiasm and, with the strong support of the leadership and the full cooperation of my comrades, wanted to create a modern drama depicting educated youth responding to the Party's call, going to the countryside, and transforming themselves into new-type peasants through labor training. However, due to insufficient life experience and a low level of understanding, and lacking deep feelings for workers, peasants, and soldiers, I was unable to write or perform it well, and it ended in failure.

    When creating the modern drama "Seed," I was still participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside, and I thought that compared with the past, I had more life experience, and I was closer to the peasants and educated youth who went to the countryside; but I still failed to write or perform it well. What was the reason? I pondered deeply and consulted with my comrades, and finally understood: It turned out that I had not tightly grasped the key link of thoroughly remolding my own thoughts and feelings, had not fully recognized the truth that "to perform revolutionary dramas, one must first be a revolutionary," and had not closely combined the process of shaping heroic figures in revolutionary modern dramas with the process of thoroughly changing my position and viewpoint and thoroughly remolding my worldview, and had not regarded the latter as the premise of the former.

      “A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.” Having learned a lesson from this failure, my comrades and I continued to go deep into life, going to the rural areas of the Pearl River Delta to implement the "three togethers" with the poor and lower-middle peasants. This time, it was a step forward compared to the past. I realized that the purpose of "eating together, living together, and working together" was to achieve another "together," that is, to be "of one heart" with the poor and lower-middle peasants. I must strive to be of one heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants, share their breath, share their love and hatred, and serve them wholeheartedly, and strive to make them also regard me as "one of their own." This was a process of self-revolution and self-transformation for me. During this period, I experienced countless sleepless nights of painful reflection and many intense and sharp ideological struggles. At that time, some enthusiastic audience members wrote letters asking me, "Everyone else is performing modern dramas, what have you been doing for the past two years?" Reading the letters, I was both excited and apprehensive. This was the concern of the masses for me, and also the expectation of the masses for me. Under such circumstances, my mood could not be calm. Looking back now, when I heard the Party's call and realized the needs of the masses, although I was working hard, hoping to express the new people and new things of our great era on the stage more and better; and I also realized that this was our unshirkable task as opera workers. However, it was also mixed with some thoughts and emotions of personal gain and loss, thinking that if an actor does not appear on the stage for a long time, they will gradually be forgotten by the audience, which will affect their personal "prestige." This kind of selfish thought is very harmful. How strange, when thinking of doing my best, and doing as much as possible in my work to meet the requirements of the Party and the people, I could work together with my comrades, not afraid of setbacks, and forge ahead with high morale and full confidence. However, once my thoughts are tainted with concerns about personal gain and loss, I would be dejected and uneasy.

    In fact, this is not surprising. If we do not thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois individualism, similar phenomena will continue to occur in the future. However, under the Party's patient education and training, and with the strong encouragement and support of the masses, I was still determined to work hard to transform myself through practical life.

    After the failure of the play "Seed," we summed up our experience, made new efforts, and tried to shape a grassroots female cadre who came from a poor peasant background and grew up in the struggle between the two roads—Liang Tian in "Pearl River Wind and Thunder." Although the performance of "Pearl River Wind and Thunder" also had many shortcomings (the main problem was that we did not seriously study how Cantonese opera should reflect the revolution, and did not pay more attention to making "Pearl River Wind and Thunder" both a revolutionary modern drama and a Cantonese opera). However, it should be said that in my personal efforts to perform revolutionary modern dramas, I took a new step forward. Because, when performing this play, I realized that to perform revolutionary modern dramas, one's own thinking must first be revolutionized, so that in going deep into life and among the masses, I more consciously paid attention to transforming my own thinking. I realized that: In specific artistic practice, if you do not seriously revolutionize your non-proletarian thoughts and feelings, then you will reveal your original thoughts and feelings at any time in the creative process, in every word and deed, every aria, and every glance. No matter how you gesticulate on the stage and perform painstakingly, in the end you will still reveal your true colors. I gradually realized that the acquisition of correct positions and viewpoints, and the establishment of true worker-peasant-soldier thoughts and feelings, are more important for performing revolutionary modern dramas than technical cultivation.

    Driven by the upsurge of major brotherly opera types performing revolutionary modern dramas across the country, we began rehearsing "Mountain Village Storm." Thanks to the model of Peking Opera's "The Red Lantern," we understood more deeply how to explore the issues of "revolutionization" and "operatization" in the rehearsal process, and paid attention to handling singing, acting, recitation, and fighting on the basis of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. This was a big step forward compared to the past.

    After accepting the rehearsal task, I and the comrades of the Cantonese Opera Troupe went to the army as soldiers for a short period of time, learned from the great People's Liberation Army, learned their excellent proletarian and combative qualities and style, and received an unforgettable education. If there is anything commendable about the role of Liu Qin, it is inseparable from the education I received when I was a soldier in the army. The leadership gave me tremendous trust and support; the seniors in the Cantonese opera circles guided me in every move; and the young comrades also acted as consultants for my rehearsals and performances, reflecting my shortcomings like a mirror. With all of this, I was able to overcome difficulties little by little and finally embark on a very meaningful journey.

    I will seize the opportunity to learn from various brotherly opera types and troupes, and work together with everyone to strive to climb the peak of revolutionary modern drama and promote its prosperity!

    一段不平易的路程
    红线女
    从响应党的演革命现代戏的号召开始，到这一次饰演《山乡风云》中刘琴一角，我在思想认识和艺术实践上，都经历了一段不平易的路程。这是在领导支持和同志们帮助下，一步一步地锻炼改造自己，提高思想认识以及表演艺术的过程。
    过去，我也演过一些现代题材的剧目，但是，由于当时对演出现代戏的意义认识肤浅，没有认识到演不演革命现代戏，是个为社会主义服务、抑或为资本主义和封建主义服务的政治方向问题；是站在无产阶级和劳动人民一边、抑或站在资产阶级和封建势力一边，走社会主义道路抑或走资本主义道路的大是大非问题。所以，当时我把现代戏的人物创造，还只看作是艺术上的问题。虽然那时也承认要深入生活、深入群众，而且也开始这样做了，可是那时想到的只是为了理解人物、熟悉人物，以便把现代戏中的人物塑造得更“象”一些，以免演得走了样而已。还没有认识到深入生活要和思想改造这个根本要求联系在一起。虽然，在演一些革命英雄人物
  （例如刘胡兰）的时候，自己思想上也曾受到教育，觉得对提高自己政治思想觉悟有很大作用，也极希望能多演现代戏。但是，也仅仅是这样一点愿望罢了。
    一九六三年底，我曾经满腔热情，在领导大力支持，同志们通力合作之下，想创作一个描写知识青年响应党的号召，下到农村，通过劳动锻炼，改造成为新型农民的现代戏。但是，由于生活基础不够，认识水平不高，缺乏工农兵的深厚感情，以致写不好，演不象，结果失败了。
    创作现代戏《种子》的时候，我还在农村参加社会主义教育运动，自己还以为同过去比较，多了一点生活体验，对农民和下乡青年也算接近了一些；可是仍然没有写好演好。原因究竟在哪里？我苦苦思索，也向同志们请教，才终于弄明白了：原来我还没有紧紧抓住彻底改造自己的思想感情这关键性的一环，没有充分认识到
  “要演革命戏，先做革命人”这个真理，没有把塑造革命现代戏中英雄人物的过程，同自己彻底转变立场观点、彻底改造世界观的过程密切结合起来，并且没有把后者作为前者的前提。
      “吃一堑，长一智。”从这次失败中吸取了教训，我和同志们继续深入生活，到珠江三角洲的农村里和贫下中农实行“三同”。这次下去，比过去进了一步。认识到“同吃、同住、同劳动”的目的，是要达到另一“同”，就是要和贫下中农“同心”。我必须努力做到和贫下中农一条心，同他们共呼吸，共爱憎，全心全意为他们服务，要努力做到使他们也把我看作“自己人”。这对我来说是个自我革命、自我改造的过程。在这段时间里，我经历了不知多少个苦苦思索的不眠之夜，多少次激烈尖锐的思想斗争。当时有些热心的观众写信问我，“人家都大演现代戏了，这两年你到底干什么去了？”读着信，我内心又激动又惶恐。这是群众对我的关怀，也是群众对我的期待。在这种情况下，心情是不能平静的。现在回顾一下，当时听到党的号召，认识到群众的需要，自己虽然在努力工作，希望在舞台上更多更好地表现我们这个伟大时代的新人新事；也认识到这是我们戏曲工作者责无旁贷的任务。但是，同时也掺杂了一些个人得失的思想情绪，以为一个演员长久不登舞台，会逐渐被观众忘记了，会影响个人的“威信”。这种私念是很害人的。好奇怪，当想着尽自己微小的力量，在工作中尽可能做到符合党和人民的要求的时候，自己是能和同志们一起，不怕挫折，斗志昂扬，信心百倍地勇往直前的。但是，一旦自己思想沾上顾虑个人得失的边，就会垂头丧气，行坐不安了。
    其实这也不奇怪。假如不彻底清除资产阶级个人主义的东西，将来还会不断出现类似的现象。不过，在党的耐心教育培养、群众大力鼓励支持下，我还是下定决心，努力通过实际生活锻炼改造自己。
    《种子》一剧失败之后，总结经验，重新努力，又尝试塑造一个贫农出身，在两条道路斗争中成长起来的基层妇女干部——《珠江风雷》中的梁甜。尽管《珠江风雷》的演出也存在不少缺点（主要的问题是：没有认真地研究粤剧应如何反映革命，没有更多地注意使《珠江风雷》既是革命现代戏，又是粤剧）。不过，应该说，在我个人演革命现代戏的努力过程中，是跨进了新的一步。因为，演这个戏的时候，我是认识到要演革命现代戏，首先自己的思想要革命化，从而在深入生活、深入群众当中，比较自觉地注意改造自己的思想。我认识到：在具体的艺术实践中，如果不认真地革掉自己的非无产阶级思想感情，那么，随时都会在创作过程中，在一言一语，一举一动，一个唱腔，一个眼色中，流露出原有的思想感情来。不管你在舞台上怎样装腔作势，吃力地表演，到头来还是要露出本来面目的。我逐步认识到，正确的立场观点的获得，真正的工农兵思想感情的树立，对于演好革命现代戏，比之技巧修养更重要。
    在全国各兄弟剧种大演革命现代戏的热潮推动下，开始排演《山乡风云》。由于有了京剧《红灯记》做样板，因而，在排演过程中，我们懂得更深入地探讨“革命化”和“戏曲化”的问题，注意在革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的基础上，处理唱、做、念、打。这一点，比过去是前进了一大步。
    接受排演任务之后，我和粤剧院的同志们曾下部队当了一个短时期的兵，向伟大的人民解放军学习，学习他们非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的优秀品德和作风，受到了毕生难忘的教育。如果说刘琴这个角色演得还有一点可取之处，那是同下部队当兵所受的教育分不开的。领导上给了我巨大的信任和支持；粤剧界前辈们一招一式地指点我；青年同志也当了我排练演出的顾问，象一面镜子那样照出了我的缺点。有了这一切，才使得我一点一滴地克服困难，终于走过了一段十分有意义的路程。
    我一定抓紧时机，向各兄弟剧种、剧团求教，和大家并肩携手，共同努力，为攀登革命现代戏的高峰和促其繁荣昌盛奋斗到底！
