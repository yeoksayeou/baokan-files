    The First Tricontinental Conference of the Peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, held in Havana, has successfully concluded on January 15. The conference adopted resolutions firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, a General Declaration, a General Political Resolution, and separate resolutions condemning imperialism and old and new colonialism headed by the United States, and supporting the national liberation movements of various countries. These documents reflect the common aspirations and will of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strengthen their unity and fight against imperialism.
    This conference was convened at a time when the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world are engaged in fierce battles with U.S. imperialism. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles in the Asia-Africa-Latin America region are developing in depth, and the overall situation is very good. The heroic Vietnamese people are resolutely carrying out the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and are constantly achieving brilliant victories, powerfully encouraging and supporting the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of all countries. In Laos, Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, Congo (Leopoldville), Southern Rhodesia, the Dominican Republic, and many other places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the tide of struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism headed by the United States is surging. In the Asia-Africa-Latin America region, and worldwide, a new anti-American revolutionary storm is brewing. The anti-imperialist struggles of the people of all countries are rising unprecedentedly, and U.S.-led imperialism is nearing its doom. This is the mainstream of the current situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Tricontinental Conference naturally cannot but reflect this characteristic of the current situation.
    At this conference, a powerful voice against U.S. imperialism resounded through the skies. In the speeches of the representatives, in the discussions of the group meetings, and in the many documents adopted by the conference, U.S. imperialism became the main object of exposure and condemnation. This conference in fact became a great meeting to denounce U.S. imperialism, and a mobilization meeting for the people of the three continents to strengthen their anti-American struggle.
    Countless facts prove that U.S. imperialism is the largest international exploiter, the main stronghold of colonialism, the pillar of all reactionary forces, the main force of aggression and war, the most arrogant, most ferocious, and most brutal aggressor in human history, and the general source of all evils in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to strive for independence, maintain independence, and seek liberation, cannot but oppose U.S. imperialism. In order to realize its wild ambition to conquer the world, U.S. imperialism frantically pursues a policy of aggression and war in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, engages in aggression and interference everywhere, and wantonly violates and threatens the independence of various countries. Strengthening combat unity, further expanding and consolidating the broadest international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and isolating U.S. imperialism to the greatest extent, have become the most urgent tasks of the people of the three continents. Therefore, at this conference, many representatives strongly condemned the aggressive policy and war policy of U.S. imperialism, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and emphasized that the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America must direct their spearhead at U.S. imperialism. If the struggle against U.S. imperialism is abandoned, there can be no victory, independence, peace, or progress for any revolutionary cause. The General Declaration adopted by the conference announced: "The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America understand from their own experience that the mortal enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism—is the main bastion of colonial oppression and international reaction. Overthrowing the rule of U.S. imperialism is the decisive issue for the complete and final victory of the anti-imperialist struggle in the three continents, and the efforts of the people of the three continents should converge on this goal." This is a solemn judgment on U.S. imperialism, and also a solemn call to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is the focus of the world people's anti-imperialist struggle. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America all demanded that this conference take supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation and opposing U.S. aggression against Vietnam as its central task. At a time when the Johnson administration is vigorously engaged in "peace" swindles and expanding the war, the conference issued a strong condemnation of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam, and expressed firm support for the Vietnamese people who are persisting in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Many representatives sharply exposed the "peace talks" swindle of the Johnson administration, pointed out that the Vietnam issue can only be resolved according to the will of the Vietnamese people, and called on the people of all countries to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors. The resolution on Vietnam adopted by the conference strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to intensify the expansion of the war under the cover of a "peace talks" smokescreen, angrily condemned U.S. imperialism as a war criminal, and expressed full support for the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation and the four-point proposition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops and troops of its satellite countries from South Vietnam, and recognizing the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people. This is the common cry of more than 2 billion people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    In the face of the increasingly rampant reliance of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys on counter-revolutionary violence to carry out brutal rule and armed suppression of the revolutionary movements of oppressed nations, the broad masses of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly aware that armed struggle is the correct path for oppressed nations and oppressed people to strive for independence and liberation, and are convinced that people's war is the most effective magic weapon to deal with U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Many representatives pointed out, based on their own personal experience, that revolutionary violence must be used to deal with the counter-revolutionary violence of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and that the independence and freedom of the people of all countries can only be won by arms and can only be defended by arms. The General Declaration adopted by the conference announced in clear language that the people of all countries have the right to oppose the violence of imperialism with revolutionary violence.
    Pushing the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to a new high tide is the common demand of the vast majority of representatives at the conference. However, the Khrushchev revisionists and their small handful of followers attempted to reverse the direction of the conference and lead it astray. The Khrushchev revisionists vainly attempted to impose their line of capitulationism and divisionism on this conference, and to bring the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America into the orbit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. Therefore, this conference could not but run through a sharp struggle between two lines from beginning to end.
    The Khrushchev revisionists openly wanted to set the tone for the conference according to their erroneous line. On the very day the conference opened, the Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial, saying that "the struggle for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems," "the struggle for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery," and "the struggle for universal peace" "will be the themes discussed at the Havana conference," attempting to use their so-called "universal peace," "complete and thorough disarmament," and "peaceful coexistence" to divert the conference's attention. However, the majority of the participating representatives knew that U.S. imperialism is currently engaged in armed aggression and armed intervention everywhere in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the most urgent task is to resolutely oppose the aggressive policy and war policy of U.S. imperialism and strengthen the revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. At this time, the Khrushchev revisionists are peddling their set of goods, which is actually to serve U.S. imperialism. Obviously, they cannot find a market among the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Soviet representatives exhausted all kinds of despicable means to forcibly stuff their private goods such as so-called "peaceful coexistence" into the conference, which can only make the broad masses of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America see the counter-revolutionary face of the Khrushchev revisionists more clearly.
    In a situation where the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly awakened and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle is rising unprecedentedly, the Khrushchev revisionists had to play their two-faced tricks of false anti-imperialism and real surrender, false support and real betrayal, and false unity and real division, even more hypocritically and cunningly at this conference, and adopted very covert ways to promote their erroneous line.
    The two-faced tricks of the Khrushchev revisionists were particularly evil in the Vietnam issue. In his speech at the conference, the Soviet representative hypocritically expressed support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression, but dared not strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. Compelled by the situation, he had to mention lightly that "the U.S. imperialists are hypocritically talking about negotiations," but when TASS reported this speech, even this sentence was deleted. At a time when the Johnson administration is actively launching a so-called "peace offensive," the Soviet representative at the conference tried his best to advocate "achieving peace in Vietnam," which is clearly echoing U.S. imperialism. It is no longer a secret that the Soviet leaders are actively touting the "peace talks" swindle for the United States, and the U.S. ruling authorities also hope that the Soviet leaders will help "achieve peace" in Vietnam.
    What is particularly despicable is that the Khrushchev revisionists attempted to use the legitimate desire of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strengthen anti-imperialist unity, and sang the high-sounding tune of so-called "unity," "alliance," and "concerted action." There is no doubt that at this time when the struggle between aggression and anti-aggression is very acute, all truly anti-imperialist forces need to unite and establish the broadest international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. However, what the Khrushchev revisionists advocated is obviously not such an anti-imperialist unity. Since they regard the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their collaborator, are single-mindedly uniting with U.S. imperialism to pursue U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, and place themselves in a position opposed to the revolutionary people of all countries, how can all truly anti-imperialist and revolutionary forces "unite" and "take concerted action" with the Khrushchev revisionists?
    What kind of "unity" the Khrushchev revisionists wanted was also very clear at this conference. They paid lip service to "concerted action," but when the group meeting voted on the proposal put forward by the Cambodian representative demanding that all justice-loving and peace-loving countries refuse to conduct various political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural cooperation with the United States, other representatives agreed, but the Soviet representative did not raise his hand. They paid lip service to "concerted action," but when the Dominican representative demanded condemnation of the United Nations for becoming a tool of the interests of old and new colonialism, many representatives expressed support, but the Soviet representative refused to agree. They paid lip service to "concerted action," but when the representatives of the Portuguese colonies demanded cutting off all relations with Israel, the tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression, the majority of representatives expressed support, but the Soviet representative expressed opposition. These vivid facts are enough to show that the so-called "concerted action" of the Khrushchev revisionists is not for them to unite with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, but to ask everyone to follow them in abandoning the struggle against U.S. imperialism and surrendering to U.S. imperialism. This is of course impossible.
    Throughout the entire process of the conference, the Soviet representatives tried every possible means to establish a new Tricontinental organization to replace the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, which has had eight years of anti-imperialist struggle history, vainly attempting to control the mass organizations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and their anti-imperialist actions. Their conspiratorial activities were also carried out in the name of "concerted action." This makes it very clear that the so-called unity of the Khrushchev revisionists is false, and division is real.
    Thanks to the vast majority of representatives adhering to the truth and upholding justice, and after repeated struggles, the conference achieved great success. The true face of the Khrushchev revisionists' false anti-imperialism, false support, and false unity was further exposed, and the line of capitulationism and divisionism they promoted suffered a shameful defeat. People have seen once again through this conference that the tide of anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in Asia, Africa, and Latin America cannot be stopped by any force; and at the same time, they have become more aware that to oppose imperialism, it is necessary to oppose revisionism. As the General Declaration adopted by the conference said: "The people of the three continents are determined to sweep away all obstacles on their path and to fight unyieldingly for a new Asia, a new Africa and a new Latin America completely free from imperialism and old and new colonialism. They will unite closely until complete and thorough victory is won. They are full of confidence in the future."
    Forward, revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!

### 亚非拉人民反帝革命斗争的潮流势不可当

    亚非拉人民反帝革命斗争的潮流势不可当
    在哈瓦那举行的第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议，已经在一月十五日胜利闭幕了。会议通过了坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的决议、总宣言、总政治决议和谴责以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、支援各国民族解放运动的分决议。这些文件反映了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲亿万人民加强团结反帝斗争的共同愿望和意志。
    这次会议是在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民同美帝国主义正在进行激烈搏斗的情况下召开的。亚非拉地区的反帝革命斗争正在深入发展，总的形势是很好的。英雄的越南人民坚强不屈地进行着抗美救国斗争，不断取得辉煌的胜利，有力地鼓舞和支援了各国人民的反帝斗争。在老挝、柬埔寨、日本、南朝鲜、刚果（利）、南罗得西亚、多米尼加以及亚非拉的其他许多地方，反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争浪潮汹涌澎湃。在亚非拉地区，在全世界范围内，正在酝酿着一个新的反美革命风暴。各国人民反帝斗争空前高涨，以美国为首的帝国主义日暮途穷，这是亚非拉当前形势的主流。三大洲会议自然不能不反映当前形势的这种特点。
    在这次会议上，反对美帝国主义的强大的声音响彻云霄。在代表的发言中，在小组会的讨论中，在大会通过的许多文件中，美帝国主义都成为被揭露和谴责的主要对象。这次会议事实上成了一个声讨美帝国主义的大会，成了三大洲人民加强反美斗争的动员大会。
    无数事实证明，美帝国主义是最大的国际剥削者，是殖民主义的主要堡垒，是一切反动势力的支柱，是主要的侵略和战争势力，是人类有史以来最狂妄、最凶恶、最残暴的侵略者，是亚非拉地区一切祸害的总根源。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，要争取独立，维护独立，求得解放，就不能不反对美帝国主义。美帝国主义为了实现它征服世界的狂妄野心，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲疯狂地推行侵略政策和战争政策，到处进行侵略和干涉，肆意侵犯和威胁各国的独立。加强战斗团结，进一步扩大和巩固最广泛的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线，最大限度地孤立美帝国主义，已成为三大洲人民最紧迫的任务。因此，在这次会议上，许多代表都纷纷强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，指出美帝国主义是亚非拉人民的共同敌人；强调亚非拉各国的民族民主运动必须把矛头指向美帝国主义，如果放弃反对美帝国主义的斗争，就根本谈不上任何革命事业的胜利、独立、和平和进步。会议通过的总宣言宣布：“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民由于切身经验懂得了全世界人民不共戴天的敌人——美帝国主义是殖民压迫和国际反动派的主要堡垒。推翻美帝国主义的统治是使三大洲反帝斗争取得完全和最终胜利的决定性的问题，三大洲人民的努力应该汇集到这一目标中去。”这是对美帝国主义的严正判决，也是对亚非拉人民的庄严号召。
    越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前世界人民反帝斗争的焦点。亚非拉各国人民都要求这次会议把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争、反对美国侵略越南，作为它的中心任务。在约翰逊政府正在大搞“和平”骗局和扩大战争的时候，大会对美帝国主义的侵略越南的政策发出了强烈的谴责，并对坚持抗美救国斗争的越南人民表示了坚决的声援。许多代表尖锐揭露约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局，指出越南问题只能根据越南人民的意志解决，号召各国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底，彻底打败美国侵略者。会议通过的关于越南的决议，强烈谴责美帝国主义在“和谈”烟幕掩盖下加紧扩大战争的阴谋，愤怒地把美帝国主义斥为战争罪犯，同时表示完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国的四项主张，要求立即从南越撤出美国军队和仆从国军队，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民唯一合法的代表。这是亚非拉二十多亿人民的共同呼声。
    在美帝国主义及其走狗日益猖狂地依靠反革命暴力进行残暴统治和对被压迫民族的革命运动进行武装镇压的情况下，亚非拉地区的广大人民越来越认识到武装斗争是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取独立和解放的正确道路，确信人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。许多代表根据自己的切身经验指出，必须用革命暴力来对付美帝国主义及其走狗的反革命暴力，各国人民的独立和自由只有用武装去争取，也只有用武装来保卫。会议通过的总宣言用明确的语言宣布，各国人民有权以革命的暴力来反对帝国主义的暴力。
    把亚非拉反帝革命斗争推向新的高涨，这是会议绝大多数代表的共同要求。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其一小撮追随者却力图扭转会议的方向，把会议引入歧途。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者妄想把他们的投降主义和分裂主义路线强加于这次会议，把亚非拉的民族民主运动纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道。因此，这次会议不能不自始至终贯穿着两条路线的尖锐斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者公然想要按照他们的错误路线给会议定调子。就在会议开幕的那一天，苏联《真理报》就发表编辑部文章，说什么“争取不同社会制度国家和平共处”、“争取禁止核武器及其运载工具”、“争取普遍和平的斗争”，“将是哈瓦那会议上讨论的主题”，企图用他们的所谓“普遍和平”、“全面彻底裁军”、“和平共处”那一套货色来转移会议的注意力。但是，大多数的与会代表们知道，美帝国主义目前正在亚非拉地区到处进行武装侵略和武装干涉，对于亚非拉地区的人民来说，最迫切的任务是坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在这个时候来贩卖他们的那一套货色，实际上就是要为美帝国主义效劳。很显然，他们在亚非拉革命人民当中是不可能找到市场的。苏联代表使尽了各种卑鄙手段，硬把所谓“和平共处”一类的私货强塞给会议，这只能使亚非拉广大人民更加看清赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反革命面目。
    在亚非拉人民日益觉醒、反帝革命斗争空前高涨的形势下，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在这次会议上不得不更加虚伪、更加狡猾地玩弄他们假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的两面手法，采取十分隐蔽的方式，来推销他们的错误路线。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的两面手法，在越南问题上表现得特别恶劣。苏联代表在大会发言中，假惺惺地表示支持越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争，但是却不敢强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略。他逼于形势，不得不轻描淡写地提到“美帝国主义者虚伪地谈论谈判”，但塔斯社报道这个发言的时候，连这样的一句话也删去了。在约翰逊政府正在积极发动所谓“和平攻势”的时候，苏联代表在会议上竭力鼓吹“在越南实现和平”，这显然是同美帝国主义相呼应。苏联领导人积极为美国兜售“和谈”骗局，而美国统治当局也希望苏联领导人帮助在越南“实现和平”，这已经不是什么秘密了。
    尤其可鄙的是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者企图利用亚非拉人民加强反帝团结的正当愿望，高唱所谓“团结”、“联合”、“协调一致”的滥调。毫无疑问，在侵略与反侵略斗争十分尖锐的这个时候，一切真正反帝的力量需要联合起来，建立一条最广泛的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所主张的，显然不是这样一种反帝的团结。他们既然把亚非拉人民的共同敌人当作自己的合作者，一心一意地同美帝国主义联合行动，追求美苏合作主宰世界，把自己置于同各国革命人民相对立的地位，那末一切真正反帝、革命的力量又怎么能同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者“团结一致”、“联合行动”呢？
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者要的是什么样的“团结”，在这次会议上也是表现得很明白的。他们口口声声说要“联合行动”，但是，当小组会表决柬埔寨代表提出的要求所有爱好正义、和平的国家拒绝与美国进行各种政治、外交、经济和文化合作的议案的时候，其他代表都同意，唯独苏联代表不举手。他们口口声声说要“联合行动”，但是，当多米尼加代表要求谴责联合国变成新老殖民主义利益的工具的时候，许多代表都表示支持，可是苏联代表却拒绝同意。他们口口声声说要“联合行动”，但是，当葡属殖民地代表要求断绝同美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列的一切关系的时候，多数代表表示支持，苏联代表却表示反对。这样一些活生生的事实足以说明，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的所谓“联合行动”，并不是他们同亚非拉各国人民联合起来反对美帝国主义及其走狗，而是要大家跟着他们一道，放弃反对美帝国主义的斗争，向美帝国主义投降。这当然是办不到的。
    苏联代表在整个会议的过程中，千方百计想要建立一个新的三洲机构来代替已有八年反帝斗争历史的亚非人民团结组织，妄图借此控制亚非拉群众组织及其反帝行动。他们的这种阴谋活动，也是在“联合行动”的名义下进行的。这就十分清楚，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的所谓团结是假的，分裂是真的。
    由于绝大多数代表坚持真理，坚持正义，经过反复的斗争，这次会议取得了巨大的成功。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者假反帝、假支持、假团结的真面目进一步暴露，他们推行的投降路线和分裂路线遭到了可耻的失败。人们通过这次会议再一次看到，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反帝革命斗争的潮流，是任何力量都阻挡不了的；同时也更加认识到，要反对帝国主义，就必须反对修正主义。正如会议通过的总宣言所说的：“三大洲人民决心扫除他们道路上的一切障碍，并为一个彻底摆脱帝国主义和新老殖民主义的新的亚洲、新的非洲和新的拉丁美洲而不屈地进行斗争，他们将紧密地团结在一起直到取得完全和彻底的胜利。他们对未来充满信心。”
    前进吧，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命人民！
