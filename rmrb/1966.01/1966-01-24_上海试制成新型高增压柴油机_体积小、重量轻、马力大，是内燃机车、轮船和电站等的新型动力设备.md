    Shanghai Successfully Trials New High-Boost Diesel Engine
    Small in size, light in weight, and high in horsepower, it is a new type of power equipment for diesel locomotives, ships, and power stations.
    (Our Newspaper) A new type of 2,200-horsepower high-boost diesel engine has recently been successfully trialed at the Shanghai Turbine Factory. After more than 300 hours of full-load operation testing, its performance has proven to be excellent. Before the Spring Festival, they completely disassembled this new product that had undergone trial operation, inspecting each part one by one. The results showed that the wear of the parts was normal. Currently, the workers are working intensively on various production preparations, striving to produce this new product with world-advanced level in batches as soon as possible.
    High-boost diesel engines are a new type of diesel engine that has been developed internationally since the late 1950s. It uses the exhaust gas from the diesel engine itself to drive a waste gas turbine, which increases the pressure inside the cylinder to more than two atmospheres through a compressor, increasing the horsepower of the same-sized diesel engine by more than double, and correspondingly reducing fuel consumption. Compared with ordinary diesel engines, it has the characteristics of small size, light weight, and high horsepower, providing a new type of power equipment for various sectors of the national economy. Used as an engine for diesel locomotives, it has greater horsepower and weighs more than half less than the engines of diesel locomotives currently produced in China, making it a more ideal "locomotive." When installed on inland passenger and cargo ships, it can adapt to navigation on rivers with high flow rates such as the Sichuan River. When used to assemble mobile or fixed power stations, it can generate electricity in five seconds and reach full load in ten minutes.
    The workers of the Shanghai Turbine Factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying forward the spirit of revolution, and adhering to a scientific attitude, completed the trial production task of this major new product in less than three years. The materials required to manufacture this diesel engine are three times more in variety and specification than those required to manufacture a 6,000-kilowatt gas turbine. To ensure that the material performance meets the requirements, the workers carried out a large amount of material analysis and testing work, with more than 20,000 samples for chemical analysis alone. In the manufacturing and processing process, it is necessary to adopt many new technologies and new processes. The workers vigorously carried out scientific experimental activities, creatively solved key technical problems such as crankshaft nitriding and dissimilar steel welding, and also created many new processes that had no precedent in the country. When there was insufficient equipment, they adopted the "three-in-one combination" method to solve the problem with indigenous methods.
    Many components of this machine are produced in cooperation by dozens of enterprises in more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country. These brother enterprises have trialed 26 new products for this new product, achieving "using new to match new."

    上海试制成新型高增压柴油机
    体积小、重量轻、马力大，是内燃机车、轮船和电站等的新型动力设备
    本报讯  一种新型的二千二百马力高增压柴油机，最近在上海汽轮机厂试制成功，经过三百多小时满载负荷运转试验，证明性能良好。春节前夕，他们把这台经过试运转的新产品全部拆开来，一个零件一个零件进行检验，结果表明：零件磨损情况正常。现在，职工们正在紧张地进行各项投产准备，争取早日成批生产这个具有世界先进水平的新产品。
    高增压柴油机在国际上是五十年代后期才发展起来的一种新型柴油机，它利用柴油机本身排出的废气推动废气涡轮，通过压气机把汽缸内的压力提高到二个大气压以上，使同样大小的柴油机马力提高一倍多，油耗也相应降低。与一般柴油机比较，它具有体积小，重量轻，马力大的特点，给国民经济各部门提供了一种新型的动力设备。用它做内燃机车的发动机，比我国现在生产的内燃机车的发动机的马力更大，重量要减轻一半以上，成为比较理想的“火车头”。把它安装在内河客货轮上，可以适应川江等流速较大的河流航行。用它来装配移动式或固定式电站，能够在五秒钟内发电，十分钟内达到全负荷。
    上海汽轮机厂职工高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，发扬革命精神，坚持科学态度，在不到三年的时间内，完成了这一重大新产品的试制任务。制造这种柴油机需用的材料，品种规格比制造六千瓩燃气轮机还要多三倍。为保证材料性能符合要求，职工们进行了大量的材料分析检验工作，单化学分析就做了二万多个试样。在制造和加工过程中，需要采用许多新技术，新工艺，职工们大力开展科学试验活动，创造性地解决了曲轴氮化，异种钢焊接等关键技术问题，还创造了许多国内没有先例的新工艺。设备不足，就采用三结合的方法，用土办法来解决。
    这台机器有许多配套件，是全国十几个省市的几十家企业协作生产的。这些兄弟企业为这一个新产品试制了二十六种新产品，做到了“以新配新”。
