    Ideological revolutionization inevitably manifests in practical action; only in objective practice can the depth of ideological revolutionization be seen more clearly.

    To float on the surface, without going deep among the masses, certainly does not count as revolutionization; but if, after going down, one only "enters in body" but cannot truly "enter deeply," or only uses one's hands without using one's brain, it proves that there are still problems in one's thinking.

    Leading cadres are both ordinary laborers and leaders. What the people demand of leading cadres is not only that they can work shoulder to shoulder with them, but more importantly that they lead them in revolutionization.

    互相启发
    思想革命化，必然表现于实际行动；在客观实践中，才能更清楚地看到思想革命化的深度。
    浮在上层，不深入群众，当然不算革命化；可是下去之后，只是“身入”而不能真正“深入”，或是只动手而没动脑，就证明思想上还有问题。
    领导干部，既是普通劳动者，又是领导者。人民群众要求于领导干部的，不仅要能和他们肩挨肩地劳动，更重要的是带领他们革命化。
