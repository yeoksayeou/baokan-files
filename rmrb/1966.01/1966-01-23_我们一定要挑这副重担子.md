    We Must Shoulder This Heavy Burden
    Wang Chonglun, Director of the First Processing Workshop, General Machinery Repair Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    Last year, guided by the policy of running enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought, and taking the People's Liberation Army and Daqing as models, we carried out a revolution in ideology and work style, a technological revolution, and a revolution in enterprise management, achieving an unprecedented comprehensive "bumper harvest" in recent years.

    This year was the year with the best product quality, the most new varieties produced, and the best fulfillment of contract tasks in the history of Anshan Iron and Steel, as well as a year of vigorous development of the mass movement for technological innovation and technological revolution. This year, we unleashed the proletarian anger and aimed for the strength of socialism, boldly breaking through the shackles of "foreign frameworks," liberating our minds, discarding foreign crutches, transforming foreign equipment, reforming foreign regulations, and successfully trial-produced many new types of steel. These included ultra-thin stainless steel tubes that capitalist countries used to impose harsh conditions to restrict us (we call them "Striving for Success" steel tubes), and "Anping No. 1," a new component heavy rail with better quality than foreign products, and so on. Some of these products can currently only be produced by a few countries in the world.

    Last year's practice gave us great encouragement. "What the Western bourgeoisie can do, we can definitely do, and do even better!" This is absolutely right. We Chinese workers have the ambition and ability to leave the Western bourgeoisie far behind!

    Currently, everyone in Anshan Iron and Steel is talking enthusiastically about new revolutionary ideals and formulating new goals for struggle. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, the Party and the state expect us to contribute our utmost strength to support national construction. This burden is very heavy. However, we dare to shoulder this heavy burden, and we must shoulder this heavy burden!

    How to shoulder it? The people of Daqing have set a living example for us. They have provided us with a complete set of rich experiences in giving prominence to politics and carrying out the "three great revolutions." Now, we are comparing ourselves with Daqing, summarizing our work, identifying gaps, and proposing measures, determined to give prominence to politics with high revolutionary enthusiasm, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, thoroughly realize the revolutionization of enterprises, catch up with and surpass the most advanced levels at home and abroad in production technology, and create Anshan Iron and Steel into a Daqing on the metallurgical front!

    With magnificent revolutionary ideals, we must also work hard, painstakingly, practically, and cleverly to realize this ideal. Since the beginning of the year, we have already worked hard on the word "do." The quality of "Striving for Success" steel tubes is even higher; "Anping No. 1" heavy rail has been put into mass production; and some new products, new processes, and new technologies are also being actively researched and tested.

    We firmly believe that our revolutionary ideals will definitely be realized!

    我们一定要挑这副重担子
    鞍钢机修总厂第一加工车间主任  王崇伦
    去年，我们在以毛泽东思想办企业的方针指导下，以解放军、大庆为榜样，开展了思想作风革命、技术革命和企业管理革命，获得了历年来少见的全面“大丰收”。
    这一年，是鞍钢历史上产品质量最好的一年，生产新品种最多的一年，合同任务完成得最好的一年，也是技术革新技术革命群众运动蓬勃发展的一年。这一年，我们发无产阶级之愤，图社会主义之强，大胆冲破“洋框框”的束缚，解放思想，甩掉洋拐棍，改造洋设备，改革洋规章，试制成功了许多新钢材。其中包括资本主义国家提出苛刻条件卡我们的极薄不锈钢管（我们都叫它“争气牌”钢管），和质量比外国好的“鞍平一号”新成分重轨，等等。这些产品，有的目前世界上也只有少数国家能够生产。
    去年的实践给了我们极大的鼓舞。“西方资产阶级能办到的，我们一定能办到，而且能办得更好！”这话对极了。我们中国工人就是有志气，有能力，把西方资产阶级远远甩在后面！
    目前，我们鞍钢上上下下都在畅谈新的革命理想，制定新的奋斗目标。在第三个五年计划期间，党和国家期待我们最大限度地贡献自己的力量，支援国家建设。这个担子是很重的。但是，我们敢挑这副重担子，我们一定要挑这副重担子！
    怎么挑？大庆人给我们树立了活样板。他们给我们提供了一整套突出政治进行“三大革命”的丰富经验。现在，我们正在对照大庆，总结工作，找出差距，提出措施，决心以高昂的革命热情，象大庆人那样，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底实现企业革命化，在生产技术上赶上和超过国内外最先进水平，把鞍钢创造成冶金战线上的大庆！
    有了宏伟的革命理想，还必须穷干、苦干、实干、巧干，努力实现这个理想。年初以来，我们已经在“干”字上下了功夫。“争气牌”钢管的质量更高了；“鞍平一号”重轨已经大批投入生产；一些新产品、新工艺、新技术也在积极研究试验中。
    我们坚信，我们的革命理想一定能够实现！
