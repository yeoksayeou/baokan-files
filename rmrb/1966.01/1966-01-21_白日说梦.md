    Daydreaming
    The U.S. Representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, said that Johnson’s “peace offensive” has “made the whole world believe that the United States wants peace.” This is simply lying through one's teeth.
    First, Goldberg and his ilk clearly understand in their hearts that the United States does not want peace. Second, Goldberg and his ilk know that the U.S. "peace" deception has been strongly condemned by international public opinion, and in fact, they don't believe they can deceive anyone. Therefore, Goldberg's babbling can't even be called self-deception.

    白日说梦
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡说，约翰逊的“和平攻势”，“已经使全世界相信美国要和平”。这简直是瞪眼说瞎话。
    第一，戈德堡之流显然心里明白，美国并不是要和平。第二，戈德堡之流明知美国“和平”骗局遭到了国际舆论的强烈谴责，其实他们也不相信骗得了什么人，因此，戈德堡的梦呓，连自欺欺人也说不上。
