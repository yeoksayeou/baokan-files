　　Xinhua News Agency, January 15th, New York Dispatch: According to a report in the *New York Times*, a spokesman for the U.S. Army in Western Europe revealed on the 14th that approximately 10,500 U.S. soldiers stationed in Western Europe have "volunteered" to serve in South Vietnam over the past twelve months.

　　According to this spokesman, about 6,300 of these "volunteers" have already accepted "assignments" in South Vietnam.

　　This is another development in the new Soviet leadership's collusion with the United States to engage in "detente" in Western Europe, allowing the United States to draw troops from Western Europe to strengthen its war of aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. Army Headquarters in Europe announced last year that, because "the Berlin crisis has ended," the United States will continue to withdraw troops from its forces stationed in Western Europe to South Vietnam this year.

　　An article published in the *Christian Science Monitor* on December 15th of last year frankly admitted that engaging in "detente" with the Soviet Union in Western Europe is already a fundamental component of the Johnson administration's "overall plan" for foreign policy. The article stated that the United States is "attempting to ease a central and very difficult problem for the West – the 'German question.'" Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, "in this region, the previously tense diplomatic situation is relaxing."

　　France's *Combat* published an article on December 31st stating, "1965: Asia has replaced Europe as the center of tension." "In 1965, the main source of tension was no longer Berlin, but Vietnam. Europe is calm. The United States and the Soviet Union seem to have reached a tacit truce since the standoff over the Cuban issue. Khrushchev's downfall has not disrupted this truce." "Washington and Moscow seem to be allies rather than opponents today."

　　West Germany's *Frankfurter Rundschau* sharply pointed out in a commentary that the United States "cannot take" measures to withdraw troops from Western Europe to South Vietnam "if it has not reached a tacit agreement with Moscow." The newspaper said that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are currently "not interested in the Berlin crisis," and the United States can "easily point out that the Berlin crisis has disappeared."

### 苏美默契西线“和平共处”  大量美军源源东调南越

    苏美默契西线“和平共处”  大量美军源源东调南越
    新华社十五日讯　纽约消息：据《纽约时报》报道，美国驻西欧陆军发言人十四日透露，约一万零五百名美国驻西欧士兵已在过去十二个月里表示“志愿”去南越服役。
    据这个发言人说，在这些“志愿”人员中大约六千三百人已经在南越接受了“任务”。
    这是苏联新领导勾结美国在西欧搞“缓和”，让美国可以从西欧抽调兵力加强侵越战争的又一个发展。美国驻欧陆军司令部去年曾经宣布，由于“柏林危机已经结束”，美国今年将继续从驻在西欧的部队中抽兵到南越。
    《基督教科学箴言报》去年十二月十五日刊载的一篇文章坦白承认，在西欧同苏联搞“缓和”，这已经是约翰逊政府对外政策“总计划”的基本组成部分。文章说，美国正“试图缓和对西方说来是中心的也是非常难办的问题——‘德国问题’”，在美苏之间“这片地区，一向紧张的外交局面正在松弛”。
    法国的《战斗报》十二月三十一日发表文章说，“一九六五年：亚洲代替了欧洲而成为紧张局势的中心。”“在一九六五年，紧张局势的主要策源地不再是柏林，而是越南。欧洲是平静的。美国和苏联自从在古巴问题上的对峙以来似乎已达成默契的休战，赫鲁晓夫下台并没有破坏这种休战”，“华盛顿和莫斯科在今天似乎是盟国而不是对手。”
    西德《法兰克福评论报》在一篇评论里尖锐地指出，“如果同莫斯科没有达成默契”，美国是“不能采取”从西欧抽兵到南越的措施的。这家报纸说，美苏两国目前“对柏林危机都不感兴趣”，美国可以“轻松地指出，柏林危机已经消声匿迹了。”
