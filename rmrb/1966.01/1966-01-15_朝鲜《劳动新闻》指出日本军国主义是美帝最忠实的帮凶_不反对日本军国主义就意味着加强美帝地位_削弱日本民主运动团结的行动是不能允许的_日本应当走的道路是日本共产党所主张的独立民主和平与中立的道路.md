    Korean Central News Agency dispatch, January 14th: The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial spanning two pages on January 10th, titled "Struggle Against Japanese Militarism."

    The article provides a comprehensive analysis of Japanese militarism, the Asian agent of Western imperialism, a plunderer and murderer, a provoker of war, and a strangler of national liberation movements. It fully exposes the essence of Japanese militarism, which has been revived and rearmed under the protection of US imperialism and is once again engaged in foreign aggression.

    The article warns people not to harbor illusions about the Japanese ruling clique, calls for concerted action to fight Japanese militarism, and urges that its aggression be thwarted through collective strength.

    The article is divided into four sections, each with the following subtitles: "History Is Accusing," "Japanese Militarism Revives Under the Protection of US Imperialism," "Japanese Militarism Embarks on the Road of Aggression Again," and "The Struggle Against Japanese Militarism Is a Link in the Struggle Against US Imperialism."

    In the first part, the article points out that the modern history of Japanese militarism is a history of arbitrary exploitation and fascist oppression of the people at home and endless wars of aggression and plunder against other countries.

    The article states that Japanese militarism, having embarked on the path of capitalist development later than others, and possessing specific military and semi-feudal characteristics, has the character of being the most rapacious and barbarous. It has consistently invaded and plundered weak neighboring countries and flattered Western powers.

      The article uses concrete materials to expose the crimes of aggression and war committed by Japanese militarism for nearly a century.

    The article says: Japanese militarism ascended the stage of history through wars of aggression and ultimately destroyed itself in wars of aggression.

    History proves that Japanese imperialism is the Asian agent of Western imperialism, a plunderer and murderer, a provoker of war, and a strangler of national liberation movements.

    In the second part, the article analyzes militarism as an important feature of contemporary imperialism.

    The article discusses the process by which Japanese militarism revived after the war under the protection of US imperialism and became the vanguard of US imperialism's aggression in Asia.

    The article states: In executing their plans for aggression in Asia, the US imperialists attach particular importance to Japan. They began to turn Japan into a military base, revive militarist forces, and foster them as the vanguard against the socialist camp and national liberation movements.

    The Japanese militarists, facing difficulties due to their defeat, needed the protection of US imperialism. They hoped to escape punishment for their past crimes under the protection of US imperialism, maintain their political foothold, and make a comeback to restore their former colonial empire.

    The article, in discussing the characteristics that distinguish the revived Japanese militarism from its past form, states:

    Relying on US imperialism and serving the aggressive nature of Japanese monopoly capital, this duality is the main characteristic of the revived Japanese militarism. Japanese militarism is more cunning and more dangerous because it is linked to US imperialism.

    The third part of the article points out that today's Japanese militarism, under the protection of US imperialism, is gradually embarking on the path of aggression.

    The article states: Now, Japanese monopoly capitalism is in a predicament where it cannot continue to develop without expanding foreign markets. Japan faces a serious crisis of overproduction, and all industrial sectors, except for some strategic industrial departments, are showing signs of production decline and decrease. The Japanese ruling clique is seeking to engage in foreign aggression to resolve these contradictions.

    At the same time, their blatant policy of aggression is linked to the attempt by US imperialists to use Japanese militarist forces to maintain their precarious colonial strongholds in Asia, and especially to salvage their war of aggression against Vietnam from defeat.

    The center of US imperialism's strategy in Asia is to blockade and subvert socialist countries in Asia, suppress national liberation movements, and maintain and expand the colonial system.

    To implement this strategic plan, US imperialism is plotting to piece together an anti-communist front including a group of vassal states and puppets. US imperialism is planning to assign important roles to Japanese militarists in this group, fostering them as the vanguard.

    Japan's foreign policy is serving the implementation of US imperialism's strategic plan for Asia. The Japanese government's hostility toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, its assistance in the "two Chinas" scheme, and its pursuit of a policy hostile to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are the reasons for this. At the same time, it also conspires to undermine the independent independence of newly independent countries and oppose national liberation struggles.

    Japanese militarism, together with US imperialism, is actively piecing together various military alliances in Asia.

    A military alliance between US imperialism and Japanese militarism has been formed through the "security" treaty. The "South Korea-Japan Treaty," illegally concluded last year according to the blueprint of US imperialism, is not only a political and economic treaty, but also essentially a military treaty between the reactionary ruling group of Japan and the Park Chung-hee group.

    The article says that the Japanese ruling group is trying to obstruct the unification of Korea through the "South Korea-Japan Treaty" and, in the name of the United Nations, to find reasons for sending Japanese troops to South Korea.

    The article goes on to say: The Japanese militarists, under the command of US imperialism, are busy piecing together a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Moreover, they are also implementing a strategic plan of the US imperialists to establish a single anti-communist group in Asia, even dragging in South Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and New Zealand.

    The basis of this plan is the Japanese militarism's despicable conspiracy to restore the bankrupt "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and the US imperialism's aggressive attempt to dominate the world.

    Japanese militarists, in cooperation with US imperialism, have formulated specific plans for aggression in Asia. These plans are the "Three Arrow Operations Plan" of the Japanese Defense Agency, revealed in the Japanese Diet last spring, and the later revealed "Flying Dragon Plan."

    The article points out that Japanese militarists are now actually participating in US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam and are helping US imperialism in every way.

    The article says that Japan has now become a base for US military aggression against Vietnam. Japan is constantly transporting large quantities of weapons and ammunition for the war of aggression against South Vietnam, and even sending Japanese sailors to help US troops land.

    The article continues: Japanese militarism today has shown itself to be the most loyal accomplice of US imperialism in suppressing colonial national liberation movements and opposing socialist camp countries.

    In implementing its aggressive plans, Japanese militarism, in addition to using the old methods that have been thoroughly exposed, has also adopted cunning, disguised neo-colonial methods. While actively participating in the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism, it is intensifying its economic penetration into other countries under the guise of "aid," "joint development," and "economic cooperation."

    Today, Japanese militarism is increasing the export of state capital in the form of war reparations, "aid," credit, and deferred payment exports. The main targets of Japanese militarism's expansion and aggression are Asian, African, and Latin American countries. They first focus on Southeast Asia. Japanese militarists are plotting to establish their own sphere of influence by infiltrating the Asian region on a large scale, while sponsoring the US's aggressive policies toward Asia.

    Taking advantage of the economic difficulties and unfavorable conditions of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, Japanese monopoly capital has recently particularly intensified the export of complete sets of equipment, intensified the acquisition of real estate, intensified investment in the development of underground resources, and intensified technical cooperation, and penetrated their economies more deeply. Japanese monopoly capital attempts to obstruct the newly independent Asian, African, and Latin American countries from building independent national economies.

    If the economy is violated by foreign monopoly capital, these independent countries—no matter how abundant their human and material resources may be—cannot overcome economic backwardness and deformity, nor can they consolidate their political independence.

      In addition to carrying out economic penetration, the Japanese ruling group also disguises itself as a "friend" and penetrates the religious, ideological, and cultural fields of Asian and African countries.

    In this regard, they attempt to create illusions about Japanese imperialism, obliterate national self-esteem and the revolutionary will of the people of various countries, and attempt to spread corrupt and decadent ideological toxins in order to weaken their anti-imperialist sentiments and undermine the friendship and unity between Asian and African countries. Their ultimate goal is to expand Japan's market and pave the way for the entry of Japanese monopoly capital.

      Japanese militarists, wearing the cloak of Asians, are most faithfully helping US imperialism carry out aggression, and they themselves are coming forward as direct aggressors.

    In the last part, the article warns people not to harbor illusions about the Japanese ruling group, advocates preventing Japanese militarism from infiltrating the ranks of the anti-imperialist front, and advocates taking concerted action to fight against Japanese militarism and jointly thwart its aggression.

    The article emphasizes that the struggle against Japanese militarism is linked to the struggle against US imperialism.

    The article goes on to say: US imperialism is the largest international exploiter, the bastion of contemporary colonialism, the main force of aggression and war, the chief culprit of world reaction, and the international gendarme. This conclusion reached in the statement of the Communist and Workers' Parties Conference fully conforms to today's reality.

    The article says that the United States is the most aggressive of all imperialist countries, and it still occupies a dominant position within the imperialist camp today, although certain changes have taken place in the balance of power between imperialist countries in recent years.

    Today, the number one target of the world's people's struggle is US imperialism, and reality demands that all forces that can be united be united and that the united front against US imperialism be strengthened. But this absolutely does not exclude fighting against other imperialists. While opposing US imperialism, we must also fight against other imperialists who are helping US imperialism carry out aggression. In particular, the struggle against Japanese and West German militarism must be strengthened.

    As for the danger of Japanese militarism and West German militarism, we must not take a position of overemphasizing one and underestimating the other. When assessing the world situation, we should not be dominated by prejudice or focus on either side, whether it be Europe or Asia.

    The article emphasizes that socialist countries and progressive people of all countries must turn their eyes to Asia. The article says that the situation in Asia has become very tense today. The current situation in Asia has a significant impact on the entire world situation.

    The article calls for vigilance and attention to the activities of Japanese militarism, which is currently actively sponsoring US imperialism's policy of aggression. The article emphasizes that the struggle against Japanese militarism is a link in the anti-US struggle.

    The article continues that it is very important to have a correct view of the relationship between US imperialism and Japanese militarism. We should not look at US-Japan relations one-sidedly, but comprehensively. Of course, there are some contradictions between US imperialists and Japanese rulers. The Japanese ruling group will try to get rid of US imperialism's control and restore independence as their strength relatively increases. As time goes by, US-Japan contradictions may reach a serious level.

    We should correctly use this conflict of interest between US imperialism and the Japanese rulers in accordance with the interests of the struggle against aggression and war and for peace. And it is important to further isolate US imperialism.

    However, in the current situation, the contradictions between the US and Japan should not be overestimated. Even if Japanese imperialists demand independence, we have no reason to believe that they would even form a joint anti-US front with progressive forces. We should not place too much hope in the Japanese rulers. Despite various contradictions, the relationship between US and Japanese imperialism has not reached the point of causing conflict. A master-servant alliance—this is the characteristic of current US-Japan relations. We do not fight Japanese militarism, which means strengthening the status of US imperialism.

    The article reminds people not to have any illusions about the Japanese ruling group. The article says: They are the agents of monopoly financial groups and the protectors of militarism, faithfully serving the interests of the reactionary forces in the United States and Japan.

    Therefore, a principled struggle should be waged against the Japanese rulers. We should oppose this view that proceeds from the standpoint of national egoism or from the standpoint of selfish and temporary interests. We should be vigilant against the dangerous conspiracies of the Japanese militarists, not allowing them to raise their heads again, not allowing them to act as the shock troops of US imperialism. Japanese militarists are not allowed to foster a fascist system at home, invade and plunder other countries, and dare to play with fire.

    The article condemns Japanese militarists for using the fact that Japan is located in Asia to try to squeeze into the ranks of the anti-imperialist front, flaunting themselves as friends of the Asian and African people. The article says: As the pawns of US imperialism, they conspire to weaken and disintegrate the anti-imperialist front from within, and do everything possible to obstruct the anti-imperialist struggle. We should expose the hypocrisy of the Japanese militarists and constantly expose and smash their subversive conspiracies against the anti-imperialist front. We should do this to isolate Japanese militarism on the international stage and thwart its conspiracy to infiltrate the anti-imperialist front.

    The article expresses full support for the Japanese people's struggle against Japanese militarism and emphasizes that: Standing at the forefront of the Japanese people's anti-US and anti-monopoly capital democratic movement is the vanguard of the Japanese working class, the Communist Party.

    Internationalist solidarity with the Japanese people's democratic movement should be strengthened. Any action that weakens the unity of the Japanese democratic movement's ranks is not allowed.

    The struggle against Japanese militarism is the task of the Japanese people, as well as the task of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. If all the revolutionary forces and peace-loving forces in the world unite with the Japanese people and carry out the struggle hand in hand, the aggressive conspiracy of Japanese militarism will be crushed.

    The article finally points out that the times have changed. The article says: Our era is an era of great transformation in which imperialism is rotting away day by day, and socialism and national liberation revolutions are winning victories one after another. Japanese militarists must face this harsh reality squarely. The Sato government should understand that the times have changed. If Japanese militarists forget the lessons of history and dare to re-engage in aggression, it can only lead to their own destruction.

    The path that Japan should take is the path of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality advocated by the Japanese Communist Party. Japan should break away from its subservience to US imperialism and rise up against US imperialism. This is the path that conforms to the interests of the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of all countries in the world.

    新华社十四日讯　朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜《劳动新闻》十日以两版的篇幅，刊载了一篇编辑部文章，题目是《为反对日本军国主义而斗争》。
    文章对日本军国主义这个西方帝国主义在亚洲的代理人、杀人越货的强盗，战争的挑起者和民族解放运动的绞杀者作了全面的分析，并且充分揭露了日本军国主义的本质，日本军国主义已在美帝国主义的庇护下复活和重新武装起来，并且再次从事对外侵略。
    这篇文章警告人们不要对日本统治集团抱有幻想，要求采取协力行动同日本军国主义斗争，并以集体的力量来挫败它的侵略。
    文章分四个部分，每个部分的小标题分别是《历史在控诉》、《日本军国主义在美帝国主义庇护下复活》、《日本军国主义重新走上侵略的道路》以及《反对日本军国主义的斗争是反对美帝国主义斗争中的一个环节》。
    文章在第一部分指出日本军国主义的现代史是在国内对人民进行恣意剥削和法西斯压迫、对其他国家进行无休止的侵略战争和掠夺的历史。
    文章说，日本军国主义由于后走上资本主义发展道路，由于它的特定的军事和半封建特点，具有最好掠夺、最野蛮的性格，它一贯侵略和掠夺弱小邻国，奉承西方列强。
      文章以具体材料揭露了日本军国主义将近一世纪以来所犯的侵略和战争罪行。
    文章说：日本军国主义用侵略战争登上历史舞台，终于在侵略战争中毁灭自己。
    历史证明，日本帝国主义是西方帝国主义在亚洲的代理人，是杀人越货的强盗，是战争的挑起者和民族解放运动的扼杀者。
    文章在第二部分中分析了军国主义——今天帝国主义发展的一个重要特点。
    文章谈到日本军国主义在美帝国主义的庇护下在战后复活成为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的急先锋的过程。
    文章说：美帝国主义者在执行他们侵略亚洲的计划中特别重视日本。他们开始把日本变成一个军事基地，复活军国主义势力，把它们扶植起来作为反对社会主义阵营和民族解放运动的急先锋。
    由于战败而陷入困境的日本军国主义者，从他们这方面来说，需要美帝国主义的庇护。他们希望在美帝国主义的保护下，逃避由于他们过去所犯的罪行而应受的惩罚，保持他们的政治立足点，以便卷土重来，恢复他们过去的殖民帝国。
    文章在谈到复活了的日本军国主义不同于过去的军国主义的特点时说：
    依靠美帝国主义和为日本垄断资本服务的侵略性，这种双重性就是复活了的日本军国主义的主要特点。日本军国主义更加狡猾和更加危险，因为它同美帝国主义连结在一起。
    文章的第三部分指出，今天的日本军国主义在美帝国主义的庇护下，正在一步步走上侵略的道路。
    文章说：现在，日本垄断资本主义已经处于不扩大国外市场就无从继续发展的困境。日本面临着生产过剩的严重危机，除了某些战略工业部门之外，所有工业部门都呈现着生产衰退和下降的现象。日本统治集团正在谋求从事对外侵略来解决这些矛盾。
    与此同时，他们露骨的侵略政策，是同美帝国主义者利用日本军国主义势力来保持他们在亚洲的摇摇欲坠的殖民据点的企图，特别是同挽回他们侵略越南的战争的败局的企图联系在一起的。
    美帝国主义对亚洲的战略的中心是封锁和推翻亚洲的社会主义国家、镇压民族解放运动以及保持和扩大殖民制度。
    为了实行这个战略计划，美帝国主义正在策划拼凑一条包括一批仆从国和傀儡的反共战线。美帝国主义正在计划把重要角色分派给这个集团里的日本军国主义者，扶植他们充当急先锋。
    日本的对外政策正在为执行美帝国主义对亚洲的战略计划效劳。日本政府敌视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，帮助搞“两个中国”的骗局和奉行敌视越南民主共和国的政策，原因就在于此。同时，它还阴谋破坏新独立国家的自主独立，反对民族解放斗争。
    日本军国主义和美帝国主义一起，正在积极在亚洲拼凑各种军事联盟。
    美帝国主义和日本军国主义的一个军事联盟已经通过“安全”条约而形成。去年按照美帝国主义的蓝图非法缔结的“韩日条约”，不仅是一个政治和经济的条约，而且在实质上是日本反动的统治集团和朴正熙集团之间的一项军事条约。
    文章说，日本统治集团正在力图通过“韩日条约”来阻挠朝鲜的统一，并以联合国的名义，设法为派遣日本军队到南朝鲜找理由。
    文章接着说：日本军国主义者在美帝国主义的指挥下，正在忙于拼凑包括日本、南朝鲜、台湾等在内的“东北亚军事联盟”。而且，他们还在执行美帝国主义者的一个战略计划，要在亚洲建立一个单一的反共集团，甚至把南越、菲律宾、泰国、马来西亚、澳大利亚和新西兰也拖进去。
    这一计划的基础是日本军国主义要恢复已经破产的“大东亚共荣圈”的卑鄙阴谋和美帝国主义要统治世界的侵略企图。
    日本军国主义者已经在美帝国主义的合作下，制定了侵略亚洲的具体计划。这些计划是去年春天在日本国会中揭露的日本防卫厅的“三矢作战计划”和后来揭露的“飞龙计划”。
    文章指出，日本军国主义者现在实际上参加了美帝国主义者侵略越南的战争，并在一切方面帮助美帝国主义。
    文章说，日本现在已经成为美军侵略越南的基地，日本不断输送大量武器弹药供侵略南越的战争使用，甚至派遣日本海员帮助美军登陆。
    文章接着说：日本军国主义者今天已显出它自己是美帝国主义镇压殖民地民族解放运动、反对社会主义阵营国家的最忠心的帮手。
    日本军国主义在实行它的侵略计划时，除施用已经被彻底揭露的老手法外，还采用了狡猾的、经过伪装的新殖民主义手法。他们一面积极参加美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，一面在“援助”、“共同发展”以及“经济合作”的幌子下，加紧对其他国家的经济侵入。
    今天，日本军国主义正在以战争赔款、“援助”、信贷，和延期付款的出口等方式增加国家资本的输出。日本军国主义者进行扩张和侵略的主要目标是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家。他们首先把重点放在东南亚。日本军国主义者通过大规模渗入亚洲地区阴谋建立他们自己的势力范围，同时赞助美国对亚洲的侵略政策。
    日本垄断资本利用亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的经济困难和不利条件，最近特别加紧输出成套设备，加紧获得不动产，加紧对开发地下资源进行投资，加紧技术合作，而更深入地渗入了它们的经济。日本垄断资本企图阻挠新独立的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家建设独立的民族经济。
    如果经济遭到外国垄断资本的侵犯，这些独立的国家——不管它们有多么丰富的人力和物质资源——就不能克服经济上的落后和畸形的状态，也不能巩固它们的政治独立。
      日本统治集团除了进行经济渗透外，还把自己打扮成“朋友”，对亚洲和非洲国家的宗教、意识形态和文化领域进行渗透。
    在这一点上，他们企图制造对日本帝国主义的幻想，磨灭民族自尊心和各国人民的革命意志，企图散布腐化和堕落的思想毒素，以削弱他们的反帝情绪和破坏亚洲和非洲国家之间的友谊和团结。它们的最终目的是要扩大日本的市场，为日本垄断资本的侵入铺平道路。
      日本军国主义者披着亚洲人的外衣，正在最忠实地帮助美帝国主义进行侵略，他们自己还出面充当直接的侵略者。
    文章在最后一部分警告人们不要对日本统治集团抱幻想，主张防止日本军国主义潜入反帝阵线的队伍，主张采取一致行动，为反对日本军国主义和共同挫败它的侵略而斗争。
    文章强调反对日本军国主义的斗争同反对美帝国主义的斗争是联系在一起的。
    文章接着说：美帝国主义是国际上最大的剥削者，当代殖民主义的堡垒，侵略和战争的主要势力，世界反动派的元凶和国际宪兵。共产党和工人党代表会议的声明中所下的这个结论完全符合今天的现实。
    文章说，美国是所有帝国主义国家中最富有侵略性的国家，它今天仍在帝国主义阵营内占统治地位，虽然最近几年来在帝国主义国家之间的力量对比方面已发生了某些变化。
    今天，世界人民斗争的头号目标是美帝国主义，现实要求团结一切可以团结的力量和加强反对美帝国主义的统一战线。但是这绝对不排除对其他帝国主义进行斗争。我们在反对美帝国主义的同时，还必须同正在帮助美帝国主义进行侵略的其他帝国主义进行斗争。特别是，反对日本和西德军国主义的斗争必须加强。
    至于日本军国主义和西德军国主义的危险，我们一定不能采取过分强调这个，而轻视那个的立场。我们在估计世界局势的时候，不应受偏见的支配，或侧重于任何一方，不管是欧洲也好，亚洲也好。
    文章强调说，社会主义各国和各国进步人民必须把眼睛转向亚洲。文章说，今天亚洲局势已变得十分紧张。目前的亚洲局势对整个世界局势具有重大影响。
    文章要求提高警惕，注视目前积极赞助美帝国主义侵略政策的日本军国主义的活动。文章强调说，反对日本军国主义的斗争是反美斗争的一个环节。
    文章继续说，对美帝国主义和日本军国主义之间的关系持正确的观点是十分重要的。我们不应片面地看待美日关系，而应全面地看待。当然，美帝国主义者和日本统治者之间有某些矛盾。日本统治集团将试图摆脱美帝国主义的控制，并随着他们的力量相对地增长而恢复独立。随着时间的推移，美日矛盾可能达到严重的程度。
    我们应当按照反对侵略和战争、争取和平的斗争的利益来正确地利用美帝国主义和日本统治者的这种利益冲突。而且重要的是进一步孤立美帝国主义。
    但是，在目前情况下，不应当把美日矛盾估计过高。即使日本帝国主义者要求独立，我们也没有任何理由认为，他们竟然会同进步力量一起成立反美共同阵线。我们不应该把过多的希望寄托在日本统治者身上。尽管有种种矛盾，美日帝国主义之间的关系并没有达到造成冲突的程度。主仆联盟——这是目前美日关系的特点。我们不同日本军国主义斗争就意味着加强美帝国主义的地位。
    文章提醒人们不要对日本统治集团抱任何幻想。文章说：他们是垄断财阀的代理人和军国主义的保护人，忠实地为美国和日本反动势力的利益效劳。
    因此，应该对日本统治者进行有原则的斗争。应当反对从民族利己主义立场出发或从自私和暂时的利益的立场出发的这种观点。我们应当对日本军国主义者的危险阴谋提高警惕，不让他们重新抬头，不让他们充当美帝国主义的突击队。不许日本军国主义者在国内扶植法西斯制度，侵略和掠夺其他国家和胆敢玩火。
    文章谴责日本军国主义者利用日本地处亚洲，试图挤进反帝阵线的队伍，标榜自己是亚非人民的朋友。文章说：作为美帝国主义的爪牙，他们阴谋从内部来削弱和瓦解反帝阵线，千方百计地阻挠反帝斗争。我们应当揭露日本军国主义者的伪善性，不断揭露和粉碎他们对反帝阵线的颠覆阴谋。我们应当这样来使日本军国主义在国际舞台上陷于孤立，挫败它混进反帝阵线内部的阴谋。
    文章表示完全支持日本人民反对日本军国主义的斗争，并且强调指出：站在日本人民反美和反对垄断资本的民主运动最前列的是日本工人阶级的先锋队共产党。
    同日本人民的民主运动的国际主义团结应当加强。凡是削弱日本民主运动队伍团结的任何行动都是不能允许的。
    反对日本军国主义的斗争是日本人民的任务，也是亚洲和世界爱好和平的人民的任务。如果世界上的一切革命力量和爱好和平的力量同日本人民团结在一起，携手进行斗争，日本军国主义的侵略阴谋将被粉碎。
    文章最后指出，时代改变了。文章说：我们的时代是帝国主义一天天烂下去、社会主义和民族解放革命节节胜利的大转变的时代。日本军国主义者必须正视这个严酷的现实。佐藤政府应该懂得，时代改变了。如果日本军国主义者忘记了历史教训，胆敢重新进行侵略，这只能导致他们自取灭亡。
    日本应当走的道路是日本共产党所主张的独立、民主、和平和中立的道路。日本应该摆脱屈从于美帝国主义的状态，起来反对美帝国主义。这是符合日本人民、亚洲人民和世界各国人民的利益的道路。
