    为筹款救济克什米尔难民
    我木偶艺术团在卡拉奇公演
    据新华社卡拉奇一日电中国木偶艺术团一日晚在卡拉奇举行了一次为救济克什米尔难民基金筹集款项的公演。这些难民是被印度从克什米尔印占区赶出来的。
    虽然现在正逢伊斯兰教的斋戒月，仍有一千多人踊跃观看演出，露天剧场坐得满满的。
    演出的节目每一个都受到了观众长时间的热烈鼓掌欢迎。观众们特别喜爱一个描绘巴基斯坦农民收获的欢乐的民间舞蹈。
    演出是由全巴基斯坦妇女协会主办的，协会主席塔济恩·法里迪夫人在讲话中对中国艺术家们表示谢意。
    中国木偶艺术团是在阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克演出后回国途中于十二月二十九日到达卡拉奇的。
