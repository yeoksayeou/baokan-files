    Phnom Penh, Xinhua News Agency -- Hu Ning, head of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, recently gave a speech at the Royal University of Law and Economics in Cambodia, praising China's economic construction achievements.
    The Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation visited China last September. The "Khmer Ekareach," a newspaper published in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, published Hu Ning's speech.
    Hu Ning said that Chinese workers are working hard to increase production, improve product quality, and conduct research to create new products. They work with great enthusiasm because they know they are the owners of the factories.
    Speaking of China's people's communes, he said that the people's communes mobilized all forces and solved some of the problems existing in the cooperative system. The democratic system implemented in the communes can quickly and effectively solve any possible difficulties. There is a close relationship between cadres and peasants in production teams, brigades, and communes, because they live and work together.
    He said that China has achieved remarkable results in its economic construction through self-reliance. He said: The 1965 "Chinese Export Commodities Fair" that we witnessed (many guests and businessmen from all continents visited this exhibition) is indeed "one of the proofs" of China's socialist construction achievements.
    He pointed out that the primary factor in China's economic construction achievements is people and their drive for progress. He said that during the visit, we clearly saw that what prompted the Chinese to turn the desolate Xinjiang into a region of agricultural and forestry development, and prompted them to operate factories on their own and achieve high efficiency despite the withdrawal of Soviet experts, was precisely a heart that loves their socialist country and an internationalist spirit that supports countries still under imperialist oppression.

    柬中友协访华代表团团长胡宁赞扬我自力更生方针
    中国建设成就主要靠人靠人民的上进心
    新华社金边电  柬中友好协会访华代表团团长胡宁最近在柬埔寨王国法科与经济大学发表演讲，赞扬中国经济建设成就。
    柬中友好协会访华代表团是在去年九月访问中国的。在柬埔寨首都金边出版的《棉华日报》刊载了胡宁的这篇演讲。
    胡宁说，中国工人努力增加生产，提高产品质量和进行研究以创造新产品。他们以极大的热心工作，因为他们知道，他们就是工厂的主人。
    他在谈到中国的人民公社时说，人民公社动员了一切力量，解决了合作社制度存在着的一些问题。在公社里实行的民主制度可以迅速地和有效地解决一切可能出现的困难。在生产小队、大队和公社的干部和农民之间存在着亲密的关系，因为他们一起生活，一起工作。
    他说，中国自力更生地进行经济建设取得了卓越的成绩。他说：我们亲眼看到的一九六五年的“中国出口商品交易会”（来自各大洲的许多来宾和商人参观了这个展览会），实在是中国社会主义建设成就的“证明之一”。
    他指出，中国经济建设取得成就的首要的因素是人和他们的上进心。他说，在访问中，我们清楚地看到促使中国人把荒凉的新疆变成农林业发展的地区，促使他们不顾苏联专家的撤走，自己经营工厂并且达到很高的效率，正是一颗热爱自己社会主义国家的心，和支持仍然受到帝国主义压迫的国家的国际主义精神。
