    According to a report in the Hunan Daily, a group of representatives attending the Hunan Provincial Congress of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants held a lively forum in early January to discuss how to realize the "National Agricultural Development Program." The representatives unanimously agreed that as long as they earnestly listen to Chairman Mao's words, put politics in command, prioritize hard work, grasp objective laws, and work in a down-to-earth manner, they can achieve the main targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" relatively quickly and early.

    At the forum, the representatives spoke freely, exchanged experiences, studied problems, identified gaps, laid out conditions, and resolved to strive to achieve or exceed the various targets stipulated in the "Program" as soon as possible. Representatives from production units that had already surpassed the "Program" in some key indicators broadened their horizons upon hearing the advanced experiences of other regions and resolved to reach new heights. Representatives from units that were working hard to meet the "Program" felt even more pressured by the situation and felt the need to muster even greater enthusiasm, stating that "the bigger the gap, the more we must revolutionize."

    Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, Wang Yanchun, Second Secretary, and other comrades participated in the forum, praising the revolutionary drive of the poor and lower-middle peasant representatives to meet the "Program." Comrade Zhang Pinghua said that everyone is very energetic, rushing forward with great force, and this spirit is very good. We must muster enough energy, not be bound-footed women, and stride forward. However, we must be down-to-earth and take one step at a time. We must not be impatient. Impatience will lead to carelessness and reckless actions. We must proceed from our own actual conditions, carefully summarize our own experiences, including both positive and negative experiences, make up our minds, and act according to our own actual conditions. There are many advanced experiences in various places that are worth learning from. Overall, we must act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and we must learn this well. Specifically, for each county, each commune, and each team, we must both muster our energy and remain calm. Those who can meet the "Program" in one year should do so, and those whose conditions are not sufficient should actively create conditions; if one year is not enough, then two years, and if two years are not enough, then three years. Step by step, working steadily, it may seem slow, but it is actually fast. In short, we must have great enthusiasm and take steady steps.

    Many representatives cited a large number of facts to illustrate that meeting the "Program" is not a question of whether it can be done, but a question of whether it will be done. We must put politics in command and prioritize hard work. Li Guangqing, a model rice producer, said: "If our thinking overcomes the mountain pass, then our yield can meet the 'Program'." Cheng Zhuangfei, Deputy Secretary of the Jinggang District Committee, said that in the past three years, agricultural production in their district had shown a "saddle shape": in 1963, the average rice yield per mu in the district was 800 jin, in 1964 it dropped to over 700 jin, and in 1965 it rose again to over 900 jin. The conditions in 1964 were better than in 1963, so why did it decline instead? He said that at that time, they only wanted to maintain 800 jin, singing old tunes, taking old steps, and using old methods. As a result, they not only failed to maintain it, but it actually declined. True stability can only be grasped by those who dare to revolutionize and prioritize hard work. In 1965, they learned from the past, took the lead ideologically, and launched a great revolution, and production rapidly increased again.

    Many representatives emphasized that we must channel our energy into mastering objective laws and into solid, down-to-earth work, so that we can take big and steady steps. He Jimin, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Baiyangtian Commune in Linxiang, said that the masses there are very enthusiastic, water conservancy has basically passed the test, and a lot of fertilizer has also been produced, but they have not yet met the "Program." He said that the main reason is that sometimes they have not yet grasped the objective laws on certain issues and are not good at using scientific methods for farming. For example, planting a lot of green manure and growing it well is a good thing in itself, but they did not pay attention to rational use, and all of it was concentrated in the early rice fields, resulting in the lodging of some of the early rice. Another example is planting more double-cropping rice, which is also a good thing, but they did not pay attention to adapting to local conditions, and some fields that were not suitable for double-cropping were also planted, resulting in low yields. He said: "From this, we can see that agricultural production is very complex, and each word in the Eight-Character Charter is interconnected and mutually restrictive; if any link is not well grasped, it will not work. Without enthusiasm and crawling slowly, it is certainly impossible to meet the 'Program'; with enthusiasm, but without mastering objective laws and not being good at cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses, it is also impossible to meet the 'Program'." Many representatives shared this sentiment. Tian Qifa, a national model rice producer, said: "It is impossible to dig a well with one hoe. Everyone wants to achieve high yields, but it is not the case that if you want high yields, you will get high yields; you have to understand its temperament and find its laws."

    After returning to their hometowns, the poor and lower-middle peasant representatives who participated in the forum and the other representatives who attended the Hunan Provincial Congress of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants conducted extensive and in-depth dissemination and mobilization, so that the slogan of learning from Dazhai, catching up with Dazhai, realizing the "Program," and exceeding the "Program" gradually took root in people's hearts. Cadres and members in many places have realized that the most fundamental reason why advanced units like Dazhai, both inside and outside the province, can realize some of the main targets of the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule and achieve stable and high yields is that they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, to strive to meet the "Program" as soon as possible, we must first truly master Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to putting politics in command, and adhere to the spirit of the general line; we must take Dazhai as an example, rely on our own efforts, strive for prosperity, and work hard. Huang Xiaoying, a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yancun Brigade in Xintianpu Commune, Xinshao, actively mobilized the members of the team to study Chairman Mao's works after returning to the team. Many poor and lower-middle peasants overcame the difficulties of having no education or low education and actively participated in the study with revolutionary enthusiasm. After studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," the members said: "To be a new Foolish Old Man in the socialist era, we will learn from what is there, and we will create what is not there. As long as we muster our energy and proceed from reality, there is nothing that cannot be done." Sure enough, the winter water conservancy project of this team was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, and the winter-sown crops were also all processed and cultivated once. As soon as the representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangjia Brigade in Huaqiao Commune, Xinshao, returned to the team, he connected with twenty-seven poor and lower-middle peasant members and formed a study group to study Chairman Mao's works. They used Chairman Mao's works as a weapon for class struggle and to change the world, determined to read it every day, use it at all times, read it until they are old, and use it until they are old. After hearing the dissemination, the members of the Hongxing Brigade of Hongxing Commune in Wugang County said that in the past, production was not good enough, and they always complained about poor conditions. Now they realize that the key is still the revolutionary spirit of the people. In the final analysis, we have not yet studied and used Chairman Mao's works well. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought like the people of Dazhai and carry forward the revolutionary spirit, we are not worried that conditions cannot be changed, and we are not worried that the "Program" cannot be realized.

### 湖南贫下中农代表座谈实现“全国农业发展纲要”  要把劲头鼓得足足的，不做小脚女人  要把步子迈得稳稳的，不要毛手毛脚

    湖南贫下中农代表座谈实现“全国农业发展纲要”
    要把劲头鼓得足足的，不做小脚女人
    要把步子迈得稳稳的，不要毛手毛脚
    据湖南日报报道　出席湖南省贫农下中农代表大会的一部分代表，一月初，热烈座谈如何实现“全国农业发展纲要”的问题。代表们一致认为，只要认真听毛主席的话，政治挂帅，干字当先，掌握客观规律，扎扎实实地工作，就能较快较早地实现“全国农业发展纲要”规定的主要指标。
    代表们在座谈会上畅所欲言，互相交流经验，研究问题，找差距，摆条件，决心争取尽快实现或超过“纲要”规定的各项指标。已经在一些主要指标上跨过“纲要”的生产单位的代表，听到别的地区的先进经验，眼界更加开阔，决心更上一层楼。正在努力跨“纲要”的单位的代表，更是感到形势逼人，非鼓更大的干劲不可，他们表示“差距越大越要革命”。
    中共湖南省委第一书记张平化、第二书记王延春等同志参加了座谈会，赞扬贫农下中农代表决心跨“纲要”的革命干劲。张平化同志说，大家劲头很大，一股劲往前赶，这种精神很好。我们要把劲头鼓得足足的，不要做小脚女人，要迈开大步前进。但是，必须脚踏实地，一步一步地走。不能急躁。一急躁，就会毛手毛脚，乱闯乱干。要从自己的实际情况出发，很好地总结自己的经验，包括正面的和反面的经验，拿定主意，根据自己的实际情况办事。各地有很多先进经验，值得我们学习，总的是要按毛主席思想办事，这一条一定要学好。具体到每个县、每个社、每个队，既要鼓足劲，又要沉住气。能够一年跨“纲要”的就一年跨过，条件不够的就积极创造条件，一年不行两年，两年不行三年。一步一步，踏踏实实干下去，看起来是慢，实际上是快。总之一句话：干劲要大，步子要稳。
    许多代表列举了大量的事实说明：跨“纲要”不是一个能不能的问题，而是一个干不干的问题。要政治挂帅，干字当先。水稻丰产模范李光庆说：“思想过了坳，产量才能过‘纲要’。”靖港区委副书记程壮飞说，近三年，他们区的农业生产出现了一个“马鞍形”：一九六三年全区水稻亩产八百斤，一九六四年下降到七百多斤，一九六五年又上升到九百多斤。一九六四年的条件比一九六三年好，为什么反而下降了呢？他说，当时只想守住八百斤，唱的是老调子，走的是老步子，用的是老法子，结果不但守不住，反而下降了。真正的稳，只能掌握在敢于革命、干字当先的人们手里。一九六五年，他们吸取过去的教训，思想领先，大搞革命，生产又迅速上去了。
    许多代表都强调要把干劲鼓到掌握客观规律上去，鼓到扎扎实实的工作上去，步子才能跨得大，走得稳。临湘白羊田公社党委书记何济民说，他们那里群众干劲很大，水利基本过了关，肥料也搞得多，但是还没有跨过“纲要”。他说，主要的原因是有的时候在有的问题上还没有掌握客观规律，还不善于用科学方法种田。比如，绿肥种得多长得好，这本来是一件好事；但是没有注意合理使用，都集中使用在早稻田里，结果造成一部分早稻倒伏。再比如，多种双季稻，这也是一件好事；但是没有注意因地制宜，有一部分不适宜种双季的田也种了，产量不高。他说：“从这里可以看出，农业生产是很复杂的，八字宪法中的每个字都是互相联系、互相制约的，哪一个环节抓不好都不行。没有干劲，慢慢爬行，固然跨不了‘纲要’；有了干劲，不掌握客观规律，不善于珍惜群众劳动热情，也跨不了‘纲要’。”对于这一点，很多代表都有同感。全国水稻丰产模范田启发说：“想一锄头挖出个井是不可能的。哪个都想夺高产，可是却不是你想它高产它就高产，得摸准它的脾气，找到它的规律。”
    参加座谈会的贫农下中农代表和出席湖南省贫农下中农代表大会的其他代表回乡后，进行了广泛深入的传达和串连发动，使学大寨、赶大寨，实现“纲要”、超过“纲要”的行动口号，逐渐深入人心。许多地方的干部和社员认识到，省内外大寨式先进单位能够提前实现“全国农业发展纲要”的某些主要指标，达到了稳产高产，最根本的一条，是他们高高举起了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。因此，要争取尽快跨“纲要”，首先就要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，坚持政治挂帅，坚持总路线的精神；就要以大寨为榜样，自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗。新邵新田铺公社严村大队的贫下中农代表黄小英，回队后积极串连发动社员学习毛主席著作。许多贫农下中农克服了没有文化或文化低的困难，怀着革命热情积极参加学习。社员们学习了《愚公移山》后表示：做社会主义时代的新愚公，有样学样，无样也要创样，只要鼓足干劲，从实际出发，没有办不成器的事。果然，这个队的冬修水利提前超额完成了，冬播作物也全部加工培育了一次。新邵花桥公社杨家大队的贫农下中农代表一回队，就串连了二十七个贫农下中农社员，组成了学习毛主席著作小组。他们把毛主席著作当作进行阶级斗争和改天换地的武器，决心天天读，时时用，读到老，用到老。武冈县红星公社红星大队的社员听了传达后说，过去生产搞得不够好，总怨条件差，现在认识到关键还是人的革命精神，归根到底，是我们还没有把毛主席著作学好用好；只要象大寨人那样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬革命精神，不愁条件不能改变，不愁“纲要”不能实现。（附图片）
