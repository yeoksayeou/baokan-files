    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 20th - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 19th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk said at the inauguration ceremony of the newly built Phnom Penh-Takeo railway station in Takeo on the 18th, "In the struggle against U.S. imperialism, we are not isolated." "Therefore, we must continue to move forward along this path, and victory will surely belong to our beloved motherland."
    In his speech, Prince Sihanouk once again condemned the so-called "Free Khmer" movement supported by U.S. imperialism. He said, "Obviously, the masters of these 'Free Khmer' elements are the Americans and their Bangkok running dogs." He pointed out, "All this clearly proves what we know about the despicable and evil deeds of the Central Intelligence Agency."
    Referring to the newly built railway, Prince Sihanouk pointed out, "By completing this first part of our very important plan, our people have shown the world that our people can contribute to the construction of our motherland. You must understand why I feel particularly happy today when I see this. Of course, we are poor; we only have two arms and two legs. But because we work day and night, and we only rely on our own strength, we will make our country progress."
    Prince Sihanouk said: "If we can make our country progress while maintaining our complete independence, regardless of material poverty, then we will show other more developed countries that they can do it too. Our example will be increasingly emulated by other countries, and the victims of U.S. imperialists will gradually be liberated and will eventually eliminate this imperialism."
    Prince Sihanouk said: "However, as long as the imperialists have not been defeated, one cannot expect them to completely stop their contempt for us. Therefore, we must continue to wage the struggle against imperialism."
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 20th - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 20th, on the morning of January 12th, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet troops fired several shells at a village in Cambodia's Prey Veng Province, bombarding a Cambodian border post there and injuring two local residents.
    U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet military aircraft invaded the airspace of Cambodia's Svay Rieng Province five times on December 30th, 31st of last year and January 1st of this year, and invaded the airspace of Prey Veng Province on January 8th.
    On December 28th and 29th of last year, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet military aircraft that intruded into the airspace over Svay Rieng Province distributed leaflets in Vietnamese.

    西哈努克亲王说柬人民依靠自己力量能使祖国进步
    柬埔寨在反美斗争中决不是孤立的
    美国—南越伪军继续不断侵犯柬埔寨领土领空
    新华社金边二十日电  据柬埔寨新闻社十九日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王十八日在新建的金边—茶胶铁路的茶胶车站落成典礼上说，“在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，我们不是孤立的。”“因此，我们要继续沿着这条道路前进，胜利必将属于我们亲爱的祖国。”
    西哈努克亲王在讲话中又一次谴责美帝国主义支持的所谓“自由高棉”运动。他说，“显然，这些‘自由高棉’分子的主子是美国人及其曼谷的走狗。”他指出，“这一切十分清楚地证明了我们所知道的关于卑鄙的万恶的组织中央情报局所干的勾当。”
    西哈努克亲王在谈到这条新建的铁路时指出，“我国人民通过完成我国十分重大的计划的这个第一部分，向世界表明我国人民为建设祖国能够作出贡献，你们要懂得为什么今天当我看到这一件事感到特别高兴。当然，我们是贫穷的；我们只有两个臂膀和两条腿。但是因为我们在日以继夜地劳动，我们只依靠自己的力量，所以我们是会使我国取得进步的。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“如果我们不管物资上的贫困而能在保持我国完全独立的同时使我国前进，那么我们将向其他比较发达的国家表明，它们也能做到这一点。我们这个榜样将越来越受到别国的效法，而美帝国主义者的受害者将逐渐获得解放，并将最终消灭这个帝国主义。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“但是，只要帝国主义者还没有被打败，就不能期望它们会完全停止对我们的蔑视。所以，我们必须继续进行反对帝国主义的斗争。”
    新华社金边二十日电  据柬埔寨新闻社二十日报道，美国—南越伪军在一月十二日上午，向柬埔寨波萝勉省的一个村庄发射了好几发炮弹，轰击那里的一个柬埔寨边防哨所，打伤当地居民二人。
    美国—南越伪军的飞机在去年十二月三十日、三十一日和今年一月一日五次侵犯柬埔寨柴桢省的领空，在一月八日，侵犯波萝勉省的领空。
    去年十二月二十八日和二十九日，侵入柴桢省上空的美国—南越伪军的飞机散发了越南文的传单。
