    Concerning Revolutionary Spirit
    The petroleum industry needed a type of seamless steel pipe with fins. This steel pipe has thin blades, circles, on its surface, and its shape is very special. Trial production is certainly difficult, and the higher authorities have never issued a trial production task for it. The comrades of Yongxin Factory, after “hearing the news,” truly “took on difficulties whenever they saw them,” and proactively wrote to the relevant departments to compete for this task.
    There are two attitudes toward difficult tasks: one is to push it away, and the other is to compete for it. A push and a competition, although only a one-character difference, represent completely opposite states of mind. To push away means pushing away not only the difficult task, but also the revolutionary spirit. To compete for means competing for not only the difficult task, but also the working class’s revolutionary heroic spirit of “taking on difficulties whenever they see them.” The people of Yongxin are worthy of being the great working class in this regard.

### 争革命精神

    争革命精神
    石油工业部门需要一种带翅片的无缝钢管。这种钢管，表面有一道道、一圈圈薄薄的叶片，形状很特殊，试制当然也困难，而且上级一直没有下达这项试制任务。永鑫厂的同志“闻风”以后，真是“见困难就上”，主动给有关部门写信，把这项任务争来了。
    对待困难的任务，有两种态度，一种是推，一种是争，一推一争，虽然一字之差，却表现了完全相反的两种精神状态。一推，推掉的不仅是困难任务，而且是革命精神。一争，争得的不仅是困难任务，而且是工人阶级“见困难就上”的革命英雄气概。永鑫人在这一点上无愧于是伟大的工人阶级。
