    Another Fascist Crime
    The American judicial authorities, disregarding the people's opposition, brazenly sentenced William Epton, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Labor Party and a Black leader, to one year in prison. The American government has committed another fascist crime against the American people.
    William Epton is a brave fighter in defense of the rights of Black Americans. He is "guilty" because he participated in the anti-violence struggle of Black Americans and because he resolutely opposes the American policy of aggression against Vietnam. The American authorities' crime once again exposes that the American government is a thorough and complete defender of the American racial oppression system.
    Every time Johnson talks about the Black American issue, he always puts on a compassionate appearance, speaking many nice words sympathizing with Black people. However, what his government is actually doing is intensifying the persecution and suppression of Black masses step by step. Recently, in his "State of the Union Address," Johnson hypocritically expressed that he would take measures to eliminate racial discrimination and to uphold the "justice" where "one's hope should not be limited because of his skin color." Now, he has viciously thrown a leader of the Black movement into prison. This proves that Johnson is the most despicable and shameless hypocrite.
    The Johnson government wants to use the persecution of Epton to curb the struggle of Black Americans for liberation and to curb the movement of the American people against the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is, of course, completely futile. On the contrary, its fascist crimes can only arouse the anger of the broad masses of Black Americans and progressive people. The Johnson government is actually lifting a stone to drop it on its own feet.

### 又一法西斯罪行

    又一法西斯罪行
    美国司法当局不顾人民反对，悍然判处美国进步劳工党副主席、黑人领袖威廉·埃普顿一年徒刑。美国政府又向美国人民犯下了一桩法西斯罪行。
    威廉·埃普顿是维护美国黑人权利的一个勇敢的战士。他之所以“有罪”，是因为他参加了美国黑人的抗暴斗争，因为他坚决反对美国侵略越南的政策。美国当局的罪行再一次暴露美国政府是彻头彻尾的美国种族压迫制度的维护者。
    约翰逊每次谈到美国黑人问题，总要装出一副悲天悯人的样子，讲许多同情黑人的漂亮话。而他的政府实际上在干的却是步步加紧对黑人群众的迫害和镇压。约翰逊最近在他的“国情咨文”中还假仁假义地表示要采取措施来消除种族歧视，来维护什么“一个人的希望不应当因为他的肤色而受限制”的“正义”。现在，他却凶狠地把一位黑人运动的领袖投入监狱。这证明约翰逊是一个最卑鄙无耻的伪善者。
    约翰逊政府想用对埃普顿的迫害来遏止美国黑人争取解放的斗争，遏止美国人民反对侵越战争的运动，这当然完全是徒然的，相反的，它的这种法西斯罪行，只能激起美国广大黑人群众和进步人民的愤怒。约翰逊政府实际上又是在搬起石头砸自己的脚。
