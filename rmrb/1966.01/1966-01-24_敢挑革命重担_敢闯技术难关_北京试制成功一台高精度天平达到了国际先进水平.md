    This Newspaper reported: On the eve of the Spring Festival, the Beijing Optical Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced a high-precision balance with a maximum weighing capacity of 20 grams. Its error is around one-millionth of a gram, and its precision has reached the international advanced level.
    On the 19th, the workers gave the visitors a demonstration of the precision. The operator first used tweezers to carefully place a cotton fiber, barely visible to the naked eye, into the balance's pan, holding their breath. At this moment, the pointer on the balance's differential scale quickly rose, finally stopping at 0.0034 milligrams. Next, the operator cut out two circular pieces of paper, corrected them to make their weights equal, then took out one of them, and gently made a dot on the paper with a pencil, and put it back on the balance to re-weigh. The result of the weighing was that the weight of the pencil dot was 0.003 milligrams. The visitors touched the paper with their hands and weighed it again, and the weight increased by another 0.002 milligrams. A milligram is currently the smallest unit for calculating weight, and one million milligrams is equal to one kilogram.
    The factory's technicians and workers said that this high-precision balance was made after experiencing an ideological struggle about whether to dare to shoulder revolutionary burdens and dare to climb the peaks of technology. More than half a year ago, the national metrology department asked them to trial-produce a super-grade high-precision balance. At that time, people were talking about it, some supported it, some doubted it. Some people said that only a few countries in the world can manufacture this kind of high-precision balance, and our factory does not yet have the conditions to trial-produce such a balance. Some people believed that the precision balances previously produced in our country only reached the third-grade standard, and they advocated first trial-producing second-grade and first-grade balances, and then trial-producing super-grade balances, climbing the peaks of technology step by step.
    Later, the factory organized all the workers to study the three articles "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," as well as Premier Zhou's government work report. While studying, the workers compared themselves to their own thinking and felt that they had a responsibility to shoulder revolutionary burdens, quickly climb the peaks of technology, and contribute to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The designers summarized the past experience in trial-producing precision microbalances and absorbed the strengths of various schools of thought, and finally designed a set of blueprints for a high-precision balance. After repeated and continuous experiments, the workers in the processing group spent more than half a year successfully trial-producing more than four hundred kinds of parts and assembling them on the high-precision balance.

    敢挑革命重担  敢闯技术难关
    北京试制成功一台高精度天平达到了国际先进水平
    本报讯  春节前夕，北京光学仪器厂试制成功最大称量为二十克的高精度天平。它的误差在百万分之一克左右，精密度达到了国际先进水平。
    十九日，工人给参观者作了一次精密度的表演。操作工人先用镊子将一根肉眼不易看到的棉纤维，屏住呼吸轻轻地放在天平的转盘里。这时，天平微分标尺上的指针迅即上升，最后停留在○点○○三四毫克上。接着，操作工人又剪下两块圆纸片，经过校正使它们重量相等，随后取出其中一张，用铅笔轻轻在纸上点一点，回放到天平上重秤。衡量结果，这个铅笔点的重量是○点○○三毫克。参观者用手在纸片上摸一摸再秤，重量又增加了○点○○二毫克。毫克是目前计算重量的最小单位，一百万毫克等于一公斤。
    工厂的技术人员和工人说，这台高精度天平，是在经历了一场敢不敢挑革命重担，敢不敢攀登技术高峰的思想斗争之后才制成的。半年多前，国家计量部门要求他们试制一台超等级的高精度天平。当时人们议论纷纷，有人拥护，有人怀疑。有的人说，这种高精度天平，世界上只有少数几个国家能制造，咱们工厂还不具备试制这种天平的条件。有些人认为，我们国家以往生产的精密天平，都只达到三级标准，他们主张先试制二级、一级的，然后再试制超级的，一步一步地攀登技术高峰。
    后来，工厂组织全厂职工学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇文章，以及周总理的政府工作报告。职工们边学习边联系自己的思想进行对照，感到自己有责任挑革命重担，迅速攀登技术高峰，为中国革命，为世界革命作出贡献。设计人员总结了过去试制精密微量天平的经验，吸取诸家的长处，终于设计出一套高精度天平的图纸。加工组工人经过反复不断的试验，用半年多的时间，全部试制成功装配在高精度天平上的四百多种零部件。
