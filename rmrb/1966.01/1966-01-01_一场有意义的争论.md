    A short letter sparked a heated debate. 
    
    Many comrades are concerned about this issue, and contributions have come from all directions. What does this illustrate? 
    
    It shows that in our country, comrades in all walks of life and in every position are gradually improving their ideological awareness on the road to revolutionization, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves, and therefore pay close attention to the issue of ideological revolution, discussing it vigorously and exploring it earnestly. 
    
    This is a very gratifying phenomenon.
    
    The question raised by Comrade Lü Jian is indeed an issue that needs to be clarified in the process of revolutionization. 
    
    Many problems arise precisely in such seemingly unproblematic issues. 
    
    Many readers' letters illustrate this point.
    
    Comrades in Dalate Banner said that thinking "serving whom" is not a problem is failing to analyze the problem from a class viewpoint. 
    
    This statement has some merit. 
    
    As long as classes and class struggle still exist, people's thinking cannot be unaffected. 
    
    Even those who have already resolved the "serving whom" issue may change.
    
    Comrade Shi Ying said that whether they are veteran comrades who have gone through "mountains of knives and seas of fire," or new comrades who have not been working in the revolution for long, they must constantly transform their thinking in revolutionary practice and be re-educated. 
    
    The revolutionary situation is constantly developing, and the masses are constantly making new revolutionary demands, so people's ideological awareness must also be constantly improved. 
    
    Otherwise, the idea of "serving the people" will not be firmly established.
    
    "Because I want to serve the people for the rest of my life, I want to study 'Serve the People' for the rest of my life." 
    
    This is an important lesson that Comrade Liao Chujiang has learned from studying Chairman Mao's works. 
    
    These two sentences simply and profoundly illustrate a truth: a revolutionary's establishment of a world outlook of serving the people wholeheartedly and completely is a long-term process of ideological transformation.
    
    Of course, "how to serve" is also an important question. Without correct leadership methods and work methods, even the best wishes cannot be realized well. 
    
    However, as far as the current issue of leadership revolutionization is concerned, the primary issue is still the ideological issue of serving whom, and the core of the ideological issue lies first and foremost in whether one can serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." 
    
    Chairman Mao said: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a matter of principle." 
    
    To achieve leadership revolutionization, we must start with this "fundamental question," this "matter of principle." 
    
    Many readers are right to say that the crux of the matter lies here.

### 一场有意义的争论

    一场有意义的争论
    一篇短短的来信，引起了一场热烈的争论。很多同志关心这个问题，稿件来自四面八方。这说明了什么呢？这说明在我们国家里，各行各业、各个岗位上的同志，在革命化的道路上，思想觉悟逐步提高，自觉地运用毛泽东思想改造自己，所以对思想革命的问题很注意，议论纷纷，认真探讨。这是一个十分可喜的现象。
    吕健同志提出的问题，确实是革命化过程中需要澄清的一个问题。许多问题正是发生在这种似乎不成问题的问题之中。许多读者的来信都说明了这一点。
    达拉特旗的同志们说，认为“为谁服务”不成什么问题了，是没有用阶级观点来分析问题。这说法有一定的道理。在还存在着阶级和阶级斗争的情况下，人们的思想就不可能不受影响。就是原来已经解决了“为谁服务”问题的人，也可能起变化。
    石鹰同志说，不论是经过“刀山火海”的老同志，或者是参加革命工作时间不长的新同志，都要在革命的实践中，不断地改造自己的思想，都要重新受教育。革命形势不断向前发展，群众不断提出新的革命要求，人的思想觉悟也要不断提高。否则，“为人民服务”的思想就树不稳，树不牢。
    “因为我要为人民服务一辈子，所以我要学习一辈子《为人民服务》。”这是廖初江同志学习毛主席著作的一条重要心得。这两句话，通俗而又深刻地说明了一个道理：一个革命者，要树立完全彻底为人民服务的世界观，是一个长期的思想改造过程。
    当然，“怎样服务”也是个重要问题。没有正确的领导方法和工作方法，再好的愿望也不能很好地实现。但是，就当前领导革命化的问题来说，首先还是为谁服务的思想问题，而思想问题的核心，首先还在于能否“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。毛主席说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”要实现领导革命化，就必须从这个“根本的问题”，“原则的问题”“化”起。很多读者说得对，症结就在这里。
