    The ice peaks rise like silver swords into the sky, and the snow-capped ridges stand tall like the Great Wall. Sometimes, violent wind and snowstorms rage for days and nights, and the world is a vast expanse of white; sometimes, torrential downpours relentlessly pour down, and the roaring mountain floods shake the earth.

    This is the world-renowned Himalayan region, the roof of the world. It is on this snowy plateau, with an average elevation of over 4,500 meters, that the border troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have devoted tremendous effort and made glorious contributions to defending the motherland's borders and building the motherland's frontiers.

    On a high mountain at an altitude of more than 5,300 meters, the reporter visited a border troop unit that had temporarily come here. There were no barracks here, and no tents could be seen. The soldiers sat in small groups on the hillside covered with a thick layer of ice, holding meetings and studying. The night was extremely cold, with the temperature below minus 30 degrees Celsius. The soldiers still vigilantly held their weapons and patrolled against the wind and snow. Soldiers who were not on patrol duty slept on the snowy mountain. At dawn the next day, as soon as the reveille sounded, soldiers emerged from under the ice and snow, patted the snow off their bodies, rubbed their frostbitten hands, and cheerfully began to carry out new tasks. When the reporter asked them what they thought of this arduous life, they mostly smiled shyly and replied, "If the motherland needs us to climb snow mountains, we will climb them for the rest of our lives; if the motherland needs us to sleep on snow, we will sleep on it for the rest of our lives!"

    In the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, the reporter also visited a border defense company that had entered the plateau for duty in 1959. Over the past seven years, they have fought battles, built roads, cultivated land, and felled trees, traversing thousands of kilometers of ice and snow in the mountainous area. Recently, they just moved into their self-built barracks, and as soon as new tasks arrived, they packed their bags and set off for the snow-capped mountains. The soldiers proudly sang: "If you ask where my home is, my home is on the road."

    On this snowy plateau, many soldiers have demonstrated a spirit of being in the mountains but keeping the world in mind, and working diligently for the revolution. Young soldier Li Shenglu joined the army in 1959 and entered the Himalayan region. During his seven years of guarding the border, he joined the Communist Youth League, then the Communist Party, and was named a "Five-Good Soldier" for four consecutive years, earning one second-class merit and three third-class merits. In daily training, he was an activist; in barracks construction labor, he was a model worker. Over the years, the vegetables he grew during his spare time exceeded 4,000 catties. On the morning of September 12, 1963, he and his comrades were felling trees on a hillside. After completing his individual tree-felling task, he volunteered to help his comrades. When a pine tree several meters high began to fall down the mountain, about to hit a new soldier coming up from below, he disregarded his personal safety, leaped down the slope, and pushed the comrade away. He himself was hit by the falling tree, breaking his right leg bone. After the right leg bone was repaired, he refused the leadership's offer to take care of him in the rear and insisted on returning to the company. He said, "These high mountains and snow-capped ridges are all beautiful land of the motherland. The more arduous it is, the more people are needed!"

    Combat hero Wu Yuanming, in April 1962, stood guard at the Zerao Bridgehead in the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border. Facing the bayonets and guns of the Indian army, he stood fearlessly, crushing the shameless provocations of the Indian aggressors and safeguarding the great rivers and mountains of the motherland and the dignity of the great motherland. Now, he serves as the political deputy instructor of the company and still vigilantly guards the border outpost with all the soldiers of the company.

    The border guards in the Himalayan region are not only staunch defenders of the motherland's frontiers but also active participants in the construction of the motherland's frontiers. They go wherever there is construction. They have built brand-new houses and rich fields in many remote snow-capped mountains and deep valleys.

    The border guards stationed in the Himalayan region have been tempered and grown up in struggle. Every one of them is filled with ardent feelings for the mountainous areas and the troops. Many veteran soldiers, in the last hour of their demobilization and transfer from the company, still insisted on cooking one last meal for their comrades and standing one last guard for the people of the motherland on a snowy night. At the time of parting, they repeatedly urged the new comrades to be vigilant and protect the southwestern gate of the motherland. The new soldiers also entrusted the old comrades to tell the people of the motherland again and again that they must carry their guns well for the revolution and stand guard well for the people of the motherland, and will never allow any enemy to trample on our beautiful land.

    喜马拉雅山上的边防战士
    一座座冰峰象银剑一样高插云空，一条条雪岭象长城一样巍然屹立。有时，狂暴的风雪几天几夜不停，天地间茫茫一色；有时，滂沱的骤雨不尽地倾泻，滚滚山洪震得地动山摇。
    这就是举世闻名的世界屋脊上的喜马拉雅山区。就在这平均海拔四千五百米以上的风雪高原上，中国人民解放军边防部队，为保卫祖国边防，建设祖国边疆，付出了巨大的辛劳，作出了光荣的贡献。
    在一座海拔五千三百多米的高山上，记者访问了一支临时来到这里的边防部队。这里没有营房，也看不到帐篷，战士们三三两两围坐在铺盖着一层厚冰的山坡上开会和学习。这天夜晚奇寒，气温在零下三十度以下。战士们仍然百倍警惕地手执武器，顶着风雪巡逻。没有巡逻任务的战士，就睡在雪山上。第二天拂晓，起床的哨音一响，一个个战士从冰雪的下面钻出来，拍拍身上的雪渣，搓搓冻红的双手，又乐呵呵地开始执行新的任务了。当记者问他们对这种艰苦生活有什么想法时，他们大都腼腆地笑一笑，回答说：“祖国需要我们爬雪山，我们就爬一辈子；祖国需要我们睡雪地，我们就睡一辈子！”
    在西藏高原南部，记者还访问过一个一九五九年就进入高原执勤的边防连队。七年来，他们打过仗、修过路、种过地、伐过木，双脚踏遍了山区数千公里的冰雪。最近，他们刚刚搬进自己修建的营房，新的任务一来，就背着背包向雪山进发。战士们自豪地唱道：“要问我家住哪里？我家就在路途中。”
    在这风雪高原上，许多战士都表现了身在山区，胸怀世界，勤勤恳恳为革命的精神。青年战士李胜录，一九五九年入伍后便进入喜马拉雅山区。在驻守边防的七年时间中，他入了团，又入了党，连续四年被评为五好战士，立过一次二等功、三次三等功。在日常训练中，他是积极分子，在营房建设劳动中，他是劳动模范。几年来，他利用休息时间种出的蔬菜在四千斤以上。一九六三年九月十二日上午，他和战友们一道在山坡上伐木。完成个人伐木任务后，他又主动去帮助战友。当一株几丈高的松树开始向山下倾倒，即将打到一个从山下上来的新战士的头上时，他不顾个人安危，奋身一跃，跳到坡下推开了战友，自己却被倒下来的大树，打断了右腿骨，右腿骨接好后，又拒绝领导上要他到后方工作的照顾，坚决要求重返连队。他说：“这高山雪岭，都是祖国美丽的土地。越艰苦才越需要人！”
    战斗英雄吴元明，一九六二年四月守卫在中印边界东段的择绕桥头，面对着印度军队的刺刀和枪口凛然屹立，粉碎了印度侵略军的无耻挑衅，捍卫了祖国的大好山河和伟大祖国的尊严。现在，他担任了连队政治副指导员，仍然和全连战士一道警惕守卫在边防前哨。
    喜马拉雅山区的边防战士，不但是祖国边疆的坚强保卫者，也是祖国边疆建设的积极参加者。他们走到那里，建设到那里。他们在许多荒僻的雪山上、深谷中，建起了一幢幢崭新的房屋，一片片富饶的田园。
    守卫在喜马拉雅山区的边防战士，在斗争中受到了锻炼，得到了成长。他们每一个人对山区，对部队充满了炽热的感情。多少老战士，在复员转业离开连队的最后一个小时，还坚持要为战友煮好最后一次饭菜，为祖国人民在风雪之夜站最后一次岗。在分别的时候，他们还一再叮嘱新战友：一定要提高警惕，保卫好祖国的西南大门。新战士也一次又一次委托老战友转告祖国人民，他们一定要为革命扛好枪，为祖国人民站好岗，决不允许任何敌人践踏我们美丽的国土。
