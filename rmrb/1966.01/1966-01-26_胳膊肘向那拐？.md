    Which Way Does the Elbow Bend?
    Beijing Radio Factory No. 2　Liu Zongming
    There was a comrade in charge of material work who extracted a portion of a material that wasn't particularly abundant in his own unit to support a fraternal unit, thereby bringing certain difficulties to his own work. Everyone greatly admired his spirit. However, some comrades strongly disagreed, saying, "This person is really something new! Always bending the elbow outward." The implication being that this comrade bent his elbow in the wrong direction.
    Which way should the elbow bend? There are really only two directions: "inward" and "outward." However, people have two different views on "inward" and "outward."
    Some people believe that only the interests of a small unit are "inward," and everything else is "outward." In their eyes, comrades who act as described above are "being novel," "confused," and "bending the elbow outward."
    However, more comrades believe that the interests of the country, the interests of the people, and the interests of the revolution are the real "inward," the big "inward." It is entirely worthwhile to temporarily sacrifice some of the interests of the small "inward" for the sake of the big "inward." Even if it is necessary to sacrifice the small "inward," to sacrifice the pawn to save the chariot, they feel very happy. In their eyes, comrades who act as described above are not only not "bending the elbow outward," but are truly "bending the elbow inward," bending towards the country, bending towards the people, bending towards the revolution!
    As long as we, like Comrade Wang Jie, have our eyes "on the whole country" and "on the whole world," and think in our hearts about "the Chinese revolution" and "the world revolution," the question of whether the elbow bends "inward" or "outward" can be correctly resolved.

    胳膊肘向那拐？
    北京无线电二厂　刘宗明
    有一个负责材料工作的同志，把一种本单位并不十分富裕的材料，抽出一部分支援了兄弟单位，从而给自己的工作带来了一定的困难。大家对他这种精神都十分赞佩。但是，有个别同志却大不以为然，他们说：“这个人，真新鲜！总是胳膊肘向外拐。”言外之意，是这个同志胳膊肘拐错了方向。
    胳膊肘应该向那拐呢？方向无非两个：“里”和“外”。但是，对于“里”和“外”，人们却有两种不同的看法。
    一种人认为：只有小单位的利益才是“里”，除此全是“外”。在他们眼中，象上面这样作的同志，是“出新鲜”，“犯糊涂”，是“胳膊肘向外拐”。
    然而，更多的同志认为：国家利益、人民利益、革命的利益才是真正的“里”，是大“里”。为大“里”而暂时牺牲小“里”的一些利益，完全值得。即使需要牺牲小“里”，舍“卒”保“车”，他们也感到非常高兴。在他们眼中，象上面这样作的同志，不但不是“胳膊肘向外拐”，而是真正的“胳膊肘向里拐”，向着国家拐，向着人民拐，向着革命拐！
    只要我们象王杰同志那样，眼睛“看到全国”，“看到全世界”，心里想到“中国的革命”，“世界的革命”，胳膊肘向“里”还是向“外”的问题，就能够正确解决了。
