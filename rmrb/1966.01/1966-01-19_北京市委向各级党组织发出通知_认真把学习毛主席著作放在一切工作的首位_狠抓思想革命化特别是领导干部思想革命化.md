    The Beijing Municipal Party Committee recently issued a notice requiring all levels of Party committees in Beijing to conscientiously place the study of Chairman Mao's writings at the forefront of all work this year.
    The notice pointed out that this year is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. In order to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and to take the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting politics, as the guiding principle of all work, it is necessary to continue to implement the spirit of "leaders grasping it, grasping the leaders themselves," vigorously grasp the study of Chairman Mao's writings by leading cadres, and vigorously strengthen the leadership over the study by general cadres and workers and peasants.
    The Beijing Municipal Party Committee issued this notice to Party organizations at all levels in order to arrange for the study of Chairman Mao's writings by cadres and the masses throughout the city this year. The notice stipulates that the main requirements for cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's writings this year are: strengthen the concept of class struggle, profoundly understand the essence of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, establish the idea of serving the people of China and the people of the world; hold high the red banner of the general line of socialist construction even higher, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle, striving for strength, and building the country through diligence and thrift, carry out the movement of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other, constantly making discoveries, inventions, creations, and advancements, and striving to victoriously complete and overfulfill the tasks of the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan; study Chairman Mao's thinking on Party building, strengthen Party building, and carry forward the three major styles of combining theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, and self-criticism; continue to study Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, establish a dialectical materialist worldview, and oppose metaphysics and scholastic philosophy.
    Regarding the content of cadres and the masses studying Chairman Mao's writings, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee requested in the notice that, roughly in the first and second quarters, they should first study Chairman Mao's articles on the thought of people's war and Party building. Other content can be arranged by each unit according to its own situation. The notice emphasized the importance of leading cadres studying Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, and required that Chairman Mao's four philosophical essays be used as documents that leading cadres must often study seriously. It encourages leading cadres to squeeze time to read through Volumes I, II, III, and IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and other writings of Chairman Mao, and those with conditions can also selectively read the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Workers and peasants mainly combine their thoughts and work to study the "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" (Edition B) and "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."
    The notice of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee emphatically pointed out that Chairman Mao's books are the supreme instructions for all our work. To study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, it is especially necessary to put great effort into the word "application", to vigorously grasp ideological revolutionization, especially the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres. We must study diligently, apply conscientiously, be consistent in word and deed, and do what we say. To study Chairman Mao's writings, we must first put ourselves in it and conscientiously transform our own thinking. Leading cadres must do this even more consciously. Only when the leading cadres themselves are ideologically revolutionized can they better motivate the revolutionization of general cadres and the masses. In studying, we must adhere to the viewpoint of "one divides into two," dare to expose our own non-proletarian thoughts, expose the main contradictions in our work, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. This is the key to whether we can study well.
    The notice said that leading cadres at all levels should earnestly resolve the contradiction between study and work, closely integrate the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the current central work, and when deploying, inspecting, and summarizing work, they must first study Chairman Mao's writings, do what, study what, and use Mao Zedong Thought to solve all ideological and work problems.
    In the notice, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee requested that Party committees at all levels strengthen their leadership over the study. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously place the study of Chairman Mao's writings at the forefront of all work, and the number one leader of the Party committee must personally grasp it. The Party committee must discuss and inspect it, and must take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's writings well; it is necessary to establish necessary study systems; continue to grasp typical examples and set up pace-setters, and this year, each level of organization should have typical examples, and each industry should have pace-setters; it is necessary to strengthen the leadership over the study of Chairman Mao's writings by the masses, and conscientiously implement the principle of proceeding from reality, treating differently, and suiting measures to local conditions. All municipal-level organs, district (county) Party committees, and grassroots Party committees that have the conditions can hold short-term off-the-job study classes to train cadres and workers in rotation.

    北京市委向各级党组织发出通知
    认真把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位
    狠抓思想革命化特别是领导干部思想革命化
    活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在用字上狠下功夫，首先要把自己摆进去，认真改造自己的思想，狠抓思想革命化。领导干部更要自觉地这样做，才能更好地带动一般干部和群众革命化。
    据新华社十八日讯　中共北京市委最近在一项通知中，要求北京市的各级党委今年要认真地把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。
    通知指出，今年是第三个五年计划的第一年，为了更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，作为一切工作的纲，必须继续贯彻“头头抓，抓头头”的精神，狠抓领导干部对毛主席著作的学习，大力加强对一般干部和工农群众学习的领导。
    中共北京市委是为安排今年内全市干部和群众学习毛主席著作而向各级党组织发出这一通知的。通知中规定今年内对干部和群众学习毛主席著作的主要要求是：加强阶级斗争观念，深刻领会毛主席人民战争思想的精神实质，树立为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的思想；更高地举起社会主义建设总路线的红旗，继续发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗、奋发图强、勤俭建国的革命精神，开展比学赶帮超运动，不断地有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，为胜利地完成和超额完成第三个五年计划第一年的任务而奋斗；学习毛主席的建党思想，加强党的建设，发扬理论和实践相结合、密切联系群众、自我批评的三大作风；继续学习毛主席的哲学思想，树立辩证唯物主义世界观，反对形而上学和烦琐哲学。
    对干部和群众学习毛主席著作的内容，中共北京市委在通知中要求，大体上在第一季度和第二季度内，首先学习毛主席有关人民战争思想和党的建设的几篇文章。其它内容各单位可以根据自己的情况进行安排。通知中强调领导干部学习毛主席哲学思想的重要性，要求把毛主席的四篇哲学论文，作为领导干部必须经常认真学习的文件。提倡领导干部挤时间通读《毛泽东选集》一、二、三、四卷和毛主席的其他著作，有条件的还可以选读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。工农群众主要是结合思想和工作学习《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本和《毛主席语录》。
    中共北京市委的通知强调指出，毛主席的书是我们各项工作的最高指示。活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在用字上狠下功夫，要狠抓思想革命化，特别是领导干部的思想革命化。要刻苦读书，认真应用，言行一致，说到做到。学习毛主席著作，首先要把自己摆进去，认真改造自己的思想。领导干部更要自觉地这样做，只有领导干部自己思想革命化了，才能更好地带动一般干部和群众革命化。在学习中，必须坚持一分为二的观点，敢于揭露自己的非无产阶级思想，揭露工作中的主要矛盾，开展批评和自我批评，这是能否学好的关键。
    通知说，各级领导干部要认真解决学习和工作的矛盾，把学习毛主席著作和当前中心工作密切结合起来，在布置、检查、总结工作的时候，首先要学习毛主席著作，做什么，学什么，用毛泽东思想来解决一切思想和工作上的问题。
    中共北京市委在通知中要求各级党委要加强对学习的领导。各级党委要认真地把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，党委第一把手要亲自抓，党委要讨论和检查，并且要带头学好毛主席著作；要建立必要的学习制度；继续抓典型，树标兵，在今年内做到各级组织都有典型，各行各业都有标兵；要加强对群众学习毛主席著作的领导，认真贯彻从实际出发，区别对待，因人制宜的原则。凡是有条件的市级机关、区（县）委和基层党委，都可以举办短期脱产学习班，轮训干部和职工。
