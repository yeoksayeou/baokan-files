    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 12th. (By dispatch from Pathet Lao Radio) The Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a directive on the 7th, calling on the main forces, local forces, and militia guerrillas nationwide to enthusiastically celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army (January 20) and the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Lao Patriotic Front (January 6) with actual combat actions.

    The directive stated that our revolutionary forces have now achieved tremendous victories in all aspects. The quality of our ranks is continuously improving, and the quantity is constantly growing. The unity between our army and the various patriotic armed forces has been further strengthened. The enemies of the nation are suffering one disastrous defeat after another, and they are in a state of panic and constant collapse. At the same time, in order to salvage their defeat, the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the traitorous bandits who act as their lackeys are also making every effort to strengthen their forces, preparing to launch an unprecedentedly large-scale and ferocious offensive against the Lao patriotic forces and the liberated areas.

    In its directive, the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army called on troops and various patriotic armed forces nationwide to actively create more achievements in eliminating the enemy, mobilizing the masses, increasing production and practicing thrift, strengthening training and learning, and striving to become advanced units and outstanding commanders and fighters.

    The Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army also called in its commemorative slogans:

    Vigorously carry out the competition to promote the glorious traditions of the People's Army;

    Vigorously strengthen the construction of armed and semi-armed forces in all aspects, and be determined to defeat the U.S. imperialist robbers and their running dogs;

    Fight actively, eliminate the enemy, and vigorously carry out troop mobilization work, mobilize the people to strengthen the construction of grassroots organizations, and actively carry out production and thrift work to complete the glorious tasks of the People's Army;

    Strengthen internal unity, strengthen unity with various patriotic neutral forces, and promote the spirit of internationalist unity.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 11th. (By dispatch from Pathet Lao Radio) The military and civilians in the Lower Laos (southern Laos) region carried out 136 operations in 1965, eliminating a total of 790 enemies.
