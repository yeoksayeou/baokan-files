They launched a surprise attack on a patrolling Cambodian mixed force. Both sides exchanged fire for about five minutes, after which the Thai aggressors fled back into Thai territory.
    Another dispatch released by the Cambodian News Agency on the same day stated that from January 5th to 19th, US-South Vietnamese puppet troops' aircraft had intruded into Cambodian airspace twelve times over Kandal Province, Kratie Province, Svay Rieng Province, Prey Veng Province, Takeo Province, and Kampong Cham Province.
    Xinhua News Agency, 29th – Bangkok News: Under the instigation of US imperialism, Thai authorities are strengthening their aggressive deployments and engaging in war threats against Cambodia.
    According to Thai newspapers, the Deputy Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Thailand, Thawi, along with other senior Thai military generals and officers of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Thailand, conducted an "inspection" on the 27th in Hat Lek village, Trat Province, only 150 feet from the Cambodian border.
    While in Trat, Thawi openly clamored that the Thai armed forces were fully prepared and that he could "immediately issue a general mobilization order to crush Cambodia's Koh Kong Island." He also said that the US Marines stationed in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand, "can be deployed to the front lines at any time to support (Thai troops)."
    Thai Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Charoon, also threatened on the 26th to "take various measures and use all weapons" to deal with Cambodia.
