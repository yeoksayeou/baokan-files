    Sincerely Doing Things for the Masses
    --A Story of the Seventh Company, Second Platoon of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army Loving the People

    "The army must be united as one with the people, so that in the eyes of the people, the army is seen as their own army. Such an army will be invincible..." The Second Platoon of the Seventh Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, resolutely implements Chairman Mao's teaching. Since being stationed in rural areas in 1963, they have been able to sincerely do things for the people, whether training in the camp area or mobile camping. They have been rated as a "Four Good" Platoon for three consecutive years, and have been established by the division headquarters as a "Model Platoon in Loving the People."

    Every holiday, regardless of wind, snow, or rain, the soldiers of the Second Platoon go to Wujiabaozi to help the production team, the families of revolutionary martyrs, and the "Five Guarantees" households by sweeping courtyards, padding pigsties, carrying water, chopping firewood, thinning seedlings, and weeding... They call this day "Love the People Day."

    Speaking of "Love the People Day," there is a story behind it. Three years ago, during the Spring Festival, the Second Platoon went to Wujiabaozi to carry out a mission. They met the old man Chen Desheng, a family member of a martyr, and learned that he had no labor force at home, and his life mainly depended on the commune's care. The soldiers thought: The parents of the martyrs are our parents. After returning, they held a platoon meeting to discuss solutions. Everyone unanimously agreed to use holidays to help Uncle Chen with his work. This idea was supported by the Party branch. Since then, every holiday, the soldiers would rather put down their own affairs and travel more than twenty li to help Uncle Chen with his work. One Sunday, it rained. The soldiers of the Second Platoon thought that Uncle Chen might not have water in his jar, so they braved the rain to carry water. Although everyone's clothes were wet, they were very happy in their hearts.

    Over the past two years, the "Love the People Day" activities of the Second Platoon have become better and better, and the content of their work has also increased. They not only help Uncle Chen with his work, but also help the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire team study Chairman Mao's writings. There are two quotation boards hanging in the Wujiabaozi Production Team, which are updated once a week. So far, 109 issues have been published.

    The Second Platoon started publishing quotation boards in the winter of 1963. At that time, they listened to the reports of local cadres and learned about the specific situation of the local class struggle. They thought that we revolutionary soldiers should not only help the poor and lower-middle peasants with their work and solve their difficulties, but more importantly, we should carry out propaganda work among the masses so that Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies can take root among the people. After discussion, they decided to select and post quotations from Chairman Mao on two blackboards and hang them at the entrance of the village and along the roadside, so that the commune members can see them as soon as they go out and when they go to the fields, so that Chairman Mao's words can meet the masses every day and brighten their hearts every day.

    Over the past two years, under the influence of Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wujiabaozi have become more fond of the collective and of Chairman Mao's writings. Chen Desheng, a family member of a martyr, braved the rain and walked seven or eight li from the mountain to carry the three sets of ropes back to the team in order to prevent them from being rained on. His little granddaughter comes back from school every evening and first takes the Second Platoon's quotation board back to the team to prevent it from being blown by the wind and rain, and then hangs it out early the next day. These deeply inspire the comrades of the Second Platoon.

### 真心实意为群众办事情——记解放军某部七连二班的爱民故事

    真心实意为群众办事情
    ——记解放军某部七连二班的爱民故事
    “军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下，……。”中国人民解放军某部七连二班，坚决执行毛主席的这个教导，从一九六三年驻守农村以来，无论是在营区训练，还是流动野营，都能做到真心实意地为人民群众办事情。他们连续三年被评为四好班，被师部树立为“爱民模范班”。
    每逢假日，无论风雪阴雨，二班战士都要去吴家堡子帮助生产队、军烈属、五保户扫院子、垫猪圈、挑水、劈柴、间苗、锄地……。他们把这一天叫“爱民日”。
    提起“爱民日”，这里还有一段故事。那是三年前春节期间，二班到吴家堡子执行任务，认识了烈属陈德盛老人，了解到他家里没有劳力，生活主要是靠公社照顾。战士们想：烈士的父母，就是我们的父母。回来后，召开了班务会，研究办法，大家一致同意利用节假日帮助陈大爷干活。这个想法得到了党支部的支持。从此，每逢节假日，战士们宁肯把自己的事放下，也要往返二十多里去帮助陈大爷干活。有个星期天，下雨了，二班战士想到陈大爷的缸里可能没水了，就冒雨赶去挑水，大家的衣服虽然都淋湿了，心里却非常高兴。
    两年来，二班战士“爱民日”的活动越做越好，工作内容也越来越多。他们不仅帮助陈大爷干活，还帮助全队的贫下中农社员学习毛主席著作。在吴家堡生产队挂着两块语录板，每星期出一次，到目前为止，已出一百零九期。
    二班办语录板，是从一九六三年冬季开始的。当时，他们听了地方干部的报告，了解到当地阶级斗争的具体情况。他们想，我们革命战士不仅要帮助贫下中农干活，解决困难，更重要的是要向群众进行宣传工作，使毛泽东思想和党的政策在人民中间扎根。经过讨论，他们决定用两块黑板选登毛主席语录，挂在村头、道旁，使社员们出门就见，下地就看，让毛主席的话天天和群众见面，天天心明眼亮。
    两年来，吴家堡子的贫下中农在毛主席思想的熏陶下，更加热爱集体，热爱毛主席著作了。烈属陈德盛为了使队里的三副套绳免遭雨淋，冒雨走了七八里路，从山上把套绳背回来。他的小孙女每天晚上放学回来，首先把二班的语录板拿回队去，不让风吹雨淋，第二天又早早地挂出来。这些，深深地鼓舞了二班的同志们。
