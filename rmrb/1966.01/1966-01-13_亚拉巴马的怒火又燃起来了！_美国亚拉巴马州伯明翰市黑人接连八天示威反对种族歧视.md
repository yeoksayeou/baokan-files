　　New China News Agency, New York, 12th - News: Two hundred black students in Birmingham, Alabama, USA, held a demonstration on the 11th to protest racial discrimination.
　　Before setting out, the students heroically resisted the police's obstruction. The police attempted to confine the students within the campus and fired warning shots. The students retaliated with stones, bottles, and bricks. After eight and a half hours of struggle, they finally triumphantly left the school and flooded into the downtown area. About three hundred people continuously joined the march along the way.
　　The demonstrating masses arrived in front of City Hall and demanded to see the mayor, but were unreasonably blocked by the police.
　　This is the eighth consecutive day of marches and demonstrations by black people in Birmingham, protesting against the authorities' implementation of racial discrimination in elections. On the 10th, more than four hundred black people held a march in the downtown area of ​​Birmingham.
　　On the 8th, in Tuskegee, Alabama, more than three hundred black students, disregarding police interference and obstruction, marched in the downtown area to protest the murder of a civil rights worker on the 3rd.
　　Prior to this, black students in Tuskegee had already held three protest demonstrations.
　　According to reports, the Mayor of Tuskegee threatened on the 6th to dispatch federal troops to suppress the black people in order to control the "explosive situation" in the city.
　　According to reports, the Georgia House of Representatives in the United States took persecutory measures against a newly elected black member of the parliament, Bond, on the 10th, and did not allow him to take his seat. The reason was that Bond supported the condemnation of the US policy of aggression against Vietnam. (Attached picture)

    亚拉巴马的怒火又燃起来了！
    美国亚拉巴马州伯明翰市黑人接连八天示威反对种族歧视
    新华社十二日讯　纽约消息：美国亚拉巴马州伯明翰市的二百名黑人学生十一日举行示威游行，抗议种族歧视。
    学生们在出发前，英勇地抗击了警察的阻挠活动。警察企图把学生封锁在校园内，并且鸣枪示威。学生们用石头、瓶子和砖头还击。经过八个半小时的斗争，他们终于胜利地走出学校，涌向闹市区。一路大约有三百人不断加入游行队伍。
    示威群众来到市政厅前，要求见市长，但遭到警察的无理拦阻。
    这是伯明翰黑人接连第八天游行示威，抗议当局在选举方面实行种族歧视。在十日，有四百多名黑人在伯明翰的闹市区举行了游行。
    八日，在亚拉巴马州杜斯克基市，三百多名黑人学生不顾警察的干涉阻挠，在闹市区游行，抗议一名民权工作者在三日被杀害。
    在这以前，杜斯克基市黑人学生已经举行过三次抗议示威。
    据报道，杜斯克基市长在六日扬言要派联邦军队对黑人进行镇压，以控制这个城市的“爆炸性局势”。
    据报道，美国佐治亚州众议院十日对一名新当选的黑人议员邦德采取迫害措施，不许他取得席位。原因是邦德支持对美国侵越政策的谴责。（附图片）
