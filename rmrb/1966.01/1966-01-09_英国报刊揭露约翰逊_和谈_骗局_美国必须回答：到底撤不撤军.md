    According to Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th January, the British weekly *Tribune* published a commentary on the 7th, pointing out that the American so-called "Fourteen Points" plan for resolving the Vietnam problem says that agreeing to the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Accords will "provide an adequate basis for peace in Southeast Asia," and also says that the U.S. "does not desire bases in Southeast Asia" and "does not desire to continue stationing military personnel in South Vietnam." ... However, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk recently said that "the United States will remain in South Vietnam until the Saigon government (puppet clique) is stabilized, and its independence is no longer in doubt."
    The commentary said, "This is a contradiction, making even countries friendly to the United States doubt whether its solemnly declared desire for peace and a fair settlement is as sincere as it is widely publicized." The weekly asked: The United States must now answer this important question: Is it truly willing to withdraw?
    The *Sunday Telegraph* published an article by Sheppard on the 2nd, mocking the "peace offensive" launched by the United States, saying, "President Johnson has displayed an unparalleled spectacle to the world with his multifaceted public peace offensive on the Vietnam issue – a Texas ranch-style performance of diplomacy, or, more accurately, a dazzling circus."
    The article said that Johnson's "entire approach is nothing more than a massive campaign to win over the masses."

    英国报刊揭露约翰逊“和谈”骗局
    美国必须回答：到底撤不撤军
    据新华社伦敦七日电　英国《论坛》周刊七日发表评论指出，美国的所谓解决越南问题的“十四点”计划说什么同意一九五四年和一九六二年的日内瓦协议将“为东南亚和平提供充足的基础”，又说什么“不希望在东南亚有基地”、“不希望在南越继续留驻军事人员”……但是，美国国务卿腊斯克最近还说，“美国将留在南越，直到西贡政府（傀儡集团）得到稳定，以及它的独立再没有疑问”。
    评论说，“这是一个矛盾，使甚至同美国友好的国家也不懂它信誓旦旦地宣布的企求和平和公平解决的愿望，是否象大肆宣传的那样真诚。”这家周刊问道：美国现在必须回答这样一个重要的问题：它到底是否愿意撤走？
    《星期日电讯报》二日刊登谢泼德的一篇文章嘲笑美国发动的“和平攻势”说，“约翰逊总统以他在越南问题上的多方面的公开和平攻势向全世界显示了无与伦比的壮观景象——得克萨斯州牧场表演式的外交，或者说得更恰当些，是五光十色的马戏”。
    文章说，约翰逊的“整个的做法不过是一次大举争取群众的活动。”
