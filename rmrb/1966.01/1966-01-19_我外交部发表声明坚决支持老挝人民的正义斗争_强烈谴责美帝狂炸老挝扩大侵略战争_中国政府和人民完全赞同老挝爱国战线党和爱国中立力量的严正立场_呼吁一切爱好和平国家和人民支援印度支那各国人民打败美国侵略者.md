    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the 18th, strongly condemning US imperialism for recently dispatching aircraft to carry out indiscriminate bombing of the central and lower regions of Laos, and for spreading chemical poisons in the Upper Laos region of Luang Prabang Province, harming the Lao people.

    The statement pointed out that the US imperialism's strengthening of the bombing of Laos is an important step in expanding the war of aggression against South Vietnam to the Indochina region. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
    January 18, 1966

    Since the Johnson administration declared a "temporary halt" to the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, US imperialism's bombing of Laos has reached an unprecedented frenzy. Recently, the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces have issued multiple statements exposing the fact that US bandit aircraft are conducting round-the-clock indiscriminate bombing in the Khammouane Province and Savannakhet Province regions of central and lower Laos, causing huge losses to the lives and property of the Lao people. According to an Associated Press report, as many as three hundred American aircraft drop nearly a thousand tons of bombs and rockets every day. American aircraft are also spreading chemical poisons in the Luang Prabang Province region of upper Laos, harming the Lao people. These barbarous acts of US imperialism have aroused great indignation among the Lao people. The Chinese government and the Chinese people strongly condemn the serious crimes committed by US imperialism against the Lao people.

    US imperialism's strengthening of the bombing of Laos is an important step in expanding the war of aggression against South Vietnam to the Indochina region. For a long time, the Johnson administration has tried to turn Laos into a springboard connecting South Vietnam and Thailand, to coordinate with its war of aggression in South Vietnam. To achieve this goal, the United States has carried out a series of preparations. Since last September, many senior US officials have visited Laos one after another to conduct secret plots. The United States has shipped thousands of tons of weapons, ammunition and other war materials to Laos; accelerated the construction of Highway 13, which runs through Laos from north to south; and expanded the military airports in Vientiane, Savannakhet, Pakse, and Saravane. US imperialism has also directed the Vientiane authorities in Laos to accelerate military expansion and war preparations, declare Khammouane Province and Savannakhet Province under a state of emergency, and deploy more than twenty battalions of Lao right-wing troops to launch continuous armed attacks on the liberated areas of these two provinces. According to materials revealed from many sources, the Johnson administration is currently attempting to dispatch American and its vassal Thailand and South Vietnamese puppet ground forces to occupy the central and lower Laos regions. All this shows that the indiscriminate bombing of the central and lower Laos regions by US imperialism is a prelude to its preparation for taking larger-scale military actions.

    Just by looking at what US imperialism has done in Laos and Indochina, one can understand the purpose of the Johnson administration's recent so-called "peace offensive" on the Vietnam issue. Precisely when US imperialism is making every effort to show its "peaceful sincerity" to the world, it is actually silently dropping thousands of tons of bombs on peaceful villages and towns in Laos, killing innocent Lao people. It is also under this "peace" smokescreen that the American aggressors are intensifying the implementation of the inhuman "scorched earth policy" and "three alls policy" in South Vietnam; the United States and its vassals Thailand and South Vietnamese puppets are becoming increasingly rampant in carrying out war provocations and armed aggression against the Kingdom of Cambodia. The United States is repeatedly saying that it is willing to abide by the Geneva Accords, but in reality, it has not only torn up the 1954 Geneva Accords with its own actions, but also the 1962 Geneva Accords, which the US government signed, have been trampled on by it. It is very clear that the peace talk hoax regarding the Vietnam issue being played by the Johnson administration is a shameless mockery of the peace aspirations of the people of the world, and is an attempt to use rhetoric to cover up the barbaric war it is waging.

    The People's Republic of China is Laos's close neighbor and a signatory to the Geneva Accords. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully endorse the solemn position expressed in the previous statements of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, and firmly support the Lao people's patriotic and just struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese government calls on all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to denounce the brutal crimes of US imperialism, expose the sinister conspiracy of US imperialism's "peace offensive," support the just struggle of the people of Indochina countries, and defeat the US aggressors.

    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十八日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近派遣飞机对老挝中下寮地区狂轰滥炸，并且在上寮琅勃拉邦省撒放化学毒药，残害老挝人民。
    声明指出，美帝国主义加强对老挝的轰炸，是要把侵略南越的战争扩大到印度支那地区的一个重要步骤。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六六年一月十八日
    自从约翰逊政府宣称“暂时停止”轰炸越南民主共和国以来，美帝国主义对老挝的轰炸达到了空前疯狂的地步。最近一个时期，老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国中立力量多次发表声明，揭露美国的强盗飞机在老挝中、下寮的甘蒙省和沙湾拿吉省地区昼夜不停地进行狂轰滥炸，造成了老挝人民生命财产的巨大损失。据美联社报道，每天多达三百架美国飞机，投下了将近一千吨炸弹和火箭。美国飞机还在老挝上寮琅勃拉邦省地区撒放化学毒药，残害老挝人民。美帝国主义的这些野蛮行为，激起了老挝人民的极大愤慨。中国政府和中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义对老挝人民犯下的严重罪行。
    美帝国主义加强对老挝的轰炸，是要把侵略南越的战争扩大到印度支那地区的一个重要步骤。很久以来，约翰逊政府就力图把老挝变成连接南越和泰国的跳板，策应它在南越的侵略战争。为了达到这一目的，美国进行了一系列的准备工作。从去年九月以来，美国的许多高级官员接二连三地到老挝进行密谋策划。美国向老挝运进了成千吨的武器、弹药和其他战争物资；加紧修筑贯通老挝南北的十三号公路；扩建万象、沙湾拿吉、巴色和沙拉湾的军用机场。美帝国主义还指使老挝万象当局加紧扩军备战，宣布甘蒙省和沙湾拿吉省处于紧急状态，并且调集了二十多个营的老挝右派军队，向这两个省的解放区连续发动武装进攻。根据许多方面透露的材料，目前约翰逊政府正企图派遣美国及其仆从泰国、南越傀儡的地面部队占领中、下寮地区。这一切表明，美帝国主义对老挝中、下寮地区的狂轰滥炸，是它准备采取更大规模军事行动的前奏。
    只要看一看美帝国主义在老挝和印度支那的所作所为，就可以知道约翰逊政府最近在越南问题上玩弄所谓“和平攻势”的目的何在。正是在美帝国主义竭力向全世界表示它的“和平诚意”的时候，它实际上却在不声不响地把成千上万吨的炸弹投到老挝的和平村镇，杀害无辜的老挝人民。也正是在这种“和平”的烟幕下，美国侵略者在越南南方加紧推行惨无人道的“焦土计划”和“三光政策”；美国及其仆从泰国和南越傀儡越来越猖狂地对柬埔寨王国进行战争挑衅和武装侵略。美国口口声声说愿意遵守日内瓦协议，实际上，它不仅用自己的行动早已撕毁了一九五四年的日内瓦协议，就是美国政府签了字的一九六二年日内瓦协议，也已经被它践踏殆尽。事情很清楚，约翰逊政府玩弄的关于越南问题的和谈骗局，是对全世界人民和平愿望的一种无耻作弄，是企图利用花言巧语来掩盖它正在进行的一场野蛮战争。
    中华人民共和国是老挝的近邻和日内瓦协议的签字国。中国政府和中国人民完全赞同老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国中立力量在历次声明中所表达的严正立场，坚决支持老挝人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国正义斗争。中国政府呼吁全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，声讨美帝国主义的残暴罪行，揭露美帝国主义“和平攻势”的险恶阴谋，支援印度支那各国人民的正义斗争，打败美国侵略者。
