    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 11th. The Laotian newspaper "Torch" published an editorial on the 11th, stating that the US imperialists' "peace offensive" is merely "a conspiracy to conceal its further large-scale expansion of the war, spreading the flames of war to the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia."

    The editorial pointed out, "The Johnson ruling clique is by no means a lover of peace; its essence is a thorough warmonger."

    The editorial said: Johnson's "peace offensive" this time is a means taken by US imperialism to save its predicament in South Vietnam and attempt to obtain what it has failed to achieve on the battlefield. Because militarily, it has been battered by the people of South Vietnam; politically, the Johnson ruling clique has been strongly opposed by the people of the five continents, including the American people, and has thus fallen into the heavy encirclement of the people of the world. This is the most serious difficulty US imperialism has encountered in its history.

    The editorial expressed warm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and pointed out that the people of the world will never be fooled by the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 13th. The Cambodian newspaper "Courtesy" published a commentary on the 12th, pointing out: While the United States clamors for "peace," it continues to send troops to South Vietnam and attempts to expand the war to peaceful Cambodia. This proves that its clamor for "peace" is just to create an excuse for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The commentary pointed out that the United States is clamoring for "peace" at this time because the situation is unfavorable to it, and it fears that the Vietnamese people will further inflict a fatal blow on it. The commentary said that everyone has already seen through its conspiracy.

    The commentary said: "Vietnam does not need to negotiate with you - the Americans - to seek peace. The purpose of the Vietnamese people's struggle now is to drive you out, because the Vietnamese people regard you as imperialists."

    Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 13th. The Burmese newspaper "Mirror" published a commentary on the 13th on the recent "peace offensive" by the United States on the Vietnam issue, pointing out that the root of the Vietnam issue is the naked aggression by the United States.

    The commentary said that it is the United States that has transported troops and ammunition to South Vietnam, thousands of miles away from its own country. It is the United States that has undermined the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue.

    The commentary said: "To solve the Vietnam issue, its root cause must be eliminated. The troops of the United States and its 'allies' must withdraw from Vietnam, and the United States must abide by the 1954 Geneva Accords."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. The Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association issued a statement on the 11th, stating that US imperialism is playing a "peace talk" trick on the Vietnam issue to cover up the truth of its expanding war of aggression.

    The statement of the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association was made at the second meeting of the Standing Council on the 11th.

    The statement said that the real intention of the US government, as shown in the "Fourteen Points" proposal, is to continue to clamor about "North Vietnamese aggression," "legitimize" the US military's aggression, cover up the truth of its expanding war of aggression, buy time, and carry out military deployments in an attempt to save its defeat in South Vietnam.

    The statement said that

    亚非舆论说各国人民决不上约翰逊和谈骗局的当
    美国扩大印度支那战争阴谋掩盖不了
    全部美国侵略军必须无条件撤离南越
    新华社康开十一日电　老挝《火炬报》十一日发表社论说，美帝国主义开展“和平攻势”，只不过是为了“掩盖它进一步大规模地扩大战争，把战火燃烧到整个印度支那和东南亚而施展的一个阴谋。”
    社论指出，“约翰逊统治集团绝不是和平爱好者，它的本质就是彻头彻尾的好战者。”
    社论说：约翰逊这次开展“和平攻势”，是美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方的困境和企图取得在战场上未能取得的东西而采取的一种手段。因为在军事上，它被越南南方人民打得焦头烂额；在政治上，约翰逊统治集团遭到了包括美国人民在内的五大洲人民的强烈反对，从而陷于全世界人民的重重包围之中。这是美帝国主义有史以来所碰到的最严重的困难。
    社论表示热烈支持越南人民的正义斗争，并且指出，全世界人民是绝不会上美帝国主义的阴谋诡计的当的。
    新华社金边十三日电　柬埔寨《礼貌报》十二日发表评论指出：美国一边叫嚷谋求“和平”，一边继续不断派军队到南越去，并且企图把战争扩大到和平的柬埔寨。这证明了它叫嚷谋求“和平”，只不过是为扩大侵越战争制造借口。
    评论指出，美国这个时候大叫“谋求和平”是因为形势对它不利，它害怕越南人民进一步给予它致命的打击。评论说，但是，大家已经识破了它的阴谋。
    评论说：“越南不需要同你们——美国人——谈判，来谋求和平，现在越南人民进行斗争的目的，就是把你们赶出去，因为越南人民把你们看作是帝国主义者。”
    新华社仰光十三日电　缅甸《镜报》十三日就最近美国在越南问题上进行的“和平攻势”发表评论指出，越南问题的根源是美国进行的赤裸裸的侵略。
    评论说，正是美国把军队和弹药运到距自己国家数千英里的越南南方去。正是美国破坏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。
    评论说：“要解决越南问题，就必须消除它的祸根。美国及其‘盟国’的军队必须撤出越南，美国必须遵守一九五四年日内瓦协议。”
    据新华社东京十二日电　日本越南友好协会十一日发表声明说，美帝国主义正在越南问题上以玩弄“和谈”骗局来掩盖它扩大侵略战争的真相。
    日本越南友好协会的声明，是在十一日举行的第二次常务理事会上作出的。
    声明说，美国政府的真正意图，正象“十四点”主张中所表明的那样，是在继续叫嚣“北越侵略”，使美军的侵略“合法化”，掩盖它扩大侵略战争的真相，争取时间，进行军事部署，企图挽救它在南越的败局。
    声明说，只有根据越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五项声明，才能解决越南问题。这就是说，美帝国主义必须停止对越南的侵略，撤出在南越的一切美国军队和作战物资，越南问题应当由越南人民自己解决。
    据新华社开罗十二日电　莫三鼻给革命委员会代表西索尔十二日在这里发表声明说：“越南的和平不可能在世界各国的首都举行谈判来实现。只有侵略者无条件撤离越南，和平才能实现。”
    声明揭露约翰逊把他的所谓和平使团派往世界各地搞“和平建议”，“只是一种掩盖他的阴险用心的企图”。“我们莫三鼻给革命委员会谴责在越南的美国侵略者，明确要求美国侵略者无条件地撤出越南，让越南人民决定他们自己的问题。”
