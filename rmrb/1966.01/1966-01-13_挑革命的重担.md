    Daring to shoulder heavy burdens is a communist style that a revolutionary should possess.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said twenty years ago: "Difficult work is like a burden, placed before us, to see if we dare to take it on. Burdens come in light and heavy varieties. Some people pick the easy and avoid the difficult, pushing the heavy burden onto others, and choosing the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this; they give enjoyment to others and choose the heavy burdens for themselves, enduring hardship before others and enjoying comfort after others. These comrades are good comrades. We should all learn this communist spirit."
    The comrades of Daqing are precisely the good comrades Comrade Mao Zedong spoke of. In extremely difficult conditions, they took on the heavy burden of revolution and rapidly built a world-class oil field.
    The comrades of Jinzhou are also such good comrades. On a very weak industrial foundation, they took on the heavy burden of revolution and created a new industrial region.
    The comrades of the Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, introduced in today's newspaper, are also such good comrades. They had never produced special-shaped seamless steel tubes, had no technical data, no specialized equipment, and no engineering technicians. However, the country urgently needed special-shaped seamless steel tubes, so they took on this heavy burden. No matter how great the difficulties in the manufacturing process, they dared to undertake them, one after another. In more than three years, they successfully trial-produced more than 170 kinds of special-shaped seamless steel tubes.
    Taking on the heavy burden of revolution is the great historical task of the working class. In the development of human history, the working class must bury all systems of exploitation, smash the old world, and build a new world. This requires a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win.
    The revolutionary burden shouldered by the Chinese working class and the Chinese people is very heavy. We must carry the socialist revolution through to the end, build socialism on the foundation of "poverty and blankness," support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, and fulfill our proletarian internationalist obligations. Because Khrushchev's modern revisionism and its followers collude with imperialism and betray the revolution, our burden has become even heavier. This is an extremely glorious and arduous revolutionary task. We have the determination and courage to undertake it.
    In order to better shoulder this revolutionary burden, the most important thing is to creatively study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works. The workers of Yongxin Factory said it well: "When studying Chairman Mao's works, we must first learn from three examples: Zhang Side's thought of serving the people wholeheartedly; Bethune's lofty internationalist spirit; and the Foolish Old Man's perseverance in the face of difficulties. By comparing ourselves with these three examples, we can see further and think further, and we will feel that we should shoulder heavier burdens and make more contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!"
    In order to shoulder this heavy burden of revolution, we must strive to learn from the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army is a model for striving to shoulder heavy burdens for the revolution. Whether in wartime or peacetime, the vast numbers of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army always strive to undertake the most arduous and difficult tasks, striving to shoulder heavy burdens and striving to make more contributions to the revolution.
    Our advocacy of learning from Daqing, catching up with Daqing, surpassing Daqing, and creating Daqing-style enterprises is also advocating that more enterprises shoulder heavier revolutionary burdens for the country. Cherish the motherland in our hearts, have the world in our sights, and make greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

### 挑革命的重担

    挑革命的重担
    敢于挑重担子，是一个革命者应有的共产主义的风格。
    毛泽东同志在二十年前就说过：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”
    大庆的同志，就是毛泽东同志说的这样的好同志。他们在极其困难的条件下，挑起革命重担，迅速建成了世界上第一流的大油田。
    锦州的同志，也是这样的好同志。他们在工业十分薄弱的基础上，挑起革命的重担，创建了一个新兴工业地区。
    今天本报介绍的上海永鑫无缝钢管厂的同志，也是这样的好同志。他们从来没有生产过异型无缝钢管，一无技术资料，二无专用设备，三无工程技术人员。但是，国家迫切需要异型无缝钢管，他们就挑起这副重担子，不论在制造过程中有多大的困难，他们都勇于承担，来一个，接一个，三年多时间试制成功一百七十多种异型无缝钢管。
    挑革命的重担，这是工人阶级的伟大历史任务。工人阶级在人类历史的发展中，要埋葬一切剥削制度，粉碎旧世界，建设新世界。这就必须具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命气概。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民肩负的革命担子是很重的。我们要把社会主义革命进行到底，要在“一穷二白”的基础上建设社会主义，要支持各国人民的革命斗争，尽自己的无产阶级国际主义的义务。由于赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义及其追随者勾结帝国主义，背叛革命，我们的这副担子就更加加重了。这是极其光荣而艰巨的革命任务。我们有决心和有勇气把它担当起来。
    我们为了更好地担起这副革命重担，最重要的是活学活用毛泽东同志的著作。永鑫厂的职工说得好：“学毛主席著作，首先学三个榜样：张思德一心为人民服务的思想；白求恩崇高的国际主义精神；愚公不怕困难，坚持到底的韧劲。用这三个榜样对照自己，就看得远，想得远，就感到自己应当挑更重的担子，为中国革命，为世界革命作出更多贡献！”
    我们为了挑起这副革命的重担，要努力学习解放军。解放军是为革命争挑重担子的榜样。无论在战时和平时，解放军的广大指战员，总是争着要求担负最艰苦、最困难的任务，为挑重担而争，为给革命多作贡献而争。
    我们提倡学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，创大庆式企业，也是提倡更多的企业为国家多担革命的重担。胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为中国革命和世界革命作出更大的贡献。
