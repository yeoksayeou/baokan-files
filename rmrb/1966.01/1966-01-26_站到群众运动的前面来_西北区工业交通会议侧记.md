    Standing at the Forefront of the Mass Movement
    —A Glimpse into the Northwest Region Industrial and Transportation Conference
    As the curtain rises on the Third Five-Year Plan, workers of all nationalities on the industrial and transportation front in the Northwest region are in high spirits, ready to greet new and arduous production and construction tasks. To listen to Chairman Mao's words, to take the road of Daqing, to shed the label of backwardness in Northwest industry, and to build the Northwest into a powerful industrial base of the motherland is the common vow of the Northwest working class.
    In the face of new situations and new tasks, at a time when a new mass movement is about to arrive, what is most important? It is leadership. The Northwest Region Industrial and Transportation Conference called on leaders at all levels to stand at the forefront of the mass movement, to fully recognize that socialist construction in the Northwest region has entered a new stage of development, to fully recognize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, to fully recognize the potential of production, and to launch the increase production and practice economy movement in the Northwest region vigorously and solidly.
    Leaders' Thinking Must First Be Revolutionized
    Where does the leadership problem lie? The leadership problem is, first and foremost, a problem of the revolutionization of thinking.
    "Thinking lags behind the situation, leadership lags behind the masses," this is a problem that leading cadres from various localities and enterprises talked about a lot at the meeting. What is the current situation? What are the trends among the masses? The meeting believed that after the socialist education movement, the class consciousness of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the infinite potential hidden within them is bursting forth. The socialist revolution is driving the socialist construction cause forward vigorously with the great role of a historical locomotive. This is the current situation, this is the trend of the masses.
    This is an excellent situation, and also a compelling one. For a good leader, this is precisely a time to make a great difference. At the meeting, many comrades drew a conclusion from their own experience: when a new period of revolution and construction arrives, if the leadership recognizes the situation, stands at the forefront of the masses, and can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, forming a mighty mass movement, it will make our cause advance by leaps and bounds.
    However, faced with such a situation, some comrades have endless worries. They are always afraid that after the masses rise up, they will "create trouble," "cause problems," and "take risks." They dare not think about problems that others have not raised; they dare not do things that others have not done; and even problems that others have raised and things that others have done, they dare not think about or do. Such comrades fall behind the masses and drag the masses back from behind.
    A "battle of offense and defense" in the Gansu Metallurgical Company is a struggle between these two kinds of leadership thinking. After the socialist education movement, the mental outlook and production outlook of the enterprise have undergone great changes. In this excellent situation, how to consolidate the achievements of the socialist education movement? One opinion was to "maintain the status quo," believing that the Gansu Metallurgical Company had finally turned itself around, and it would be good enough to maintain it; another opinion was to "start a business," advocating seeking consolidation from advancement and seeking development from revolution.
    The comrades of the Gansu Metallurgical Company believed that the former opinion was wrong. If they followed this opinion, not only would they not be able to "maintain the status quo," but there would also be a risk of regression; the latter opinion was correct. They organized everyone to study "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and after a month of big contending, big blooming, and big debate, they unified their understanding and further stimulated their revolutionary spirit. Everyone unanimously believed that the main contradictions at present were: the leadership's ideology and work style lagged behind the revolutionary vigor of the masses, the basic work lagged behind the needs of production development, and the technical and economic indicators lagged behind the requirements of the revolutionary situation. Therefore, they guided the situation and, in the shortest possible time, caught up with Daqing and the advanced levels at home and abroad as the goal of struggle, mobilized the broad masses to advance victoriously, and quickly shed the label of backwardness.
    In that same year, this enterprise, which originally relied on the state to make up for losses, handed over more than 20 million yuan in profits to the state, and the annual output of its main products increased by more than double the total output of the previous two years. Since then, production has continued to develop. At this meeting, Gansu Metallurgical Company was named one of the twenty red flags on the industrial and transportation front in the Northwest region.
    What is the essence of the "battle of offense and defense"? The comrades of the Gansu Metallurgical Company said at the meeting: "The essence is whether we dare to make revolution, dare to win victory, and stand at the forefront of the masses to lead the masses forward in the face of the revolutionary situation? Or are we sticking to conventions, standing still, and standing behind the masses to drag the masses back?"
    This question is thought-provoking. The face of Northwest industry has changed greatly, especially in recent years. The quality of products has greatly improved, the variety has greatly increased, the cost has greatly decreased, and the quantity has also greatly increased. Many comrades realize that as long as they dare to make revolution, dare to win victory, and resolutely stand at the forefront of the masses to lead the masses forward, Northwest industry can catch up with the advanced level. However, some comrades only see the side of Northwest industry developing rapidly, sit in a well and look at the sky, and become arrogant, unwilling to move forward. There are also some comrades who only see the side of Northwest industry still far from the advanced level, droop their heads, belittle themselves, and dare not move forward. Both of these views are metaphysical. To revolutionize the leadership's thinking is to first clear away from the leadership's thinking these metaphysical views that do not admit backwardness and are willing to be backward, to arm oneself with the spirit of the General Line, to go all out, aim high, dare to make revolution, and dare to win victory.
    Honest People Always Hold the Initiative
    Being an honest person, telling the truth, and doing honest things is a kind of leadership style that the Northwest Region Industrial and Transportation Conference emphasized. Such people are called "the most reliable people" and "the most promising people" at the meeting. Only such people can always hold the initiative and stand in an invincible position.
    What is honesty? Honesty is seeking truth from facts, it is saying one is one, two is two, it is recognizing things according to their original appearance, and transforming things according to the objective laws of things. This kind of leadership style is the style of dialectical materialism, it is the style of proletarian revolutionaries.
    Opposed to this revolutionary style is a style that is not very honest. "Following the trend" and "going through the motions" are typical manifestations of this style. People who hold this style hear the wind, and it is rain; what others say, they also say; what others do, they also do. As a result, many tasks are "gone through the motions" and reduced to formalism.
    Why do some comrades always rely on "following the trend" to lead production? The meeting believed that this reflects that the leading comrades of some of our enterprises have not gone deep enough. They don't know much about their own enterprises. They don't know what problems there are in production, what tasks should be put forward, which tasks should be grasped first, and which tasks can be put later. They have no idea, so they have to "follow the trend." This style is a scourge of the mass movement. To carry out a mass movement, we must be honest and realistic, proceed from the reality of production, proceed from the demands of the masses, put forward practical tasks, and guide the masses forward.
    Here, a key issue is to go deep into reality and truly "seek truth" in "facts." If you don't go down, you can't tell the truth, you can't do honest things, and you can't be an honest person. In recent years, many leading cadres of industrial and transportation enterprises in the Northwest region have insisted on participating in labor and on staying at selected spots, and they have a deep understanding of this problem. The Gansu Metallurgical Company mentioned above, 95% of the cadres participate in labor. They have also formulated five systems for leading cadres to study, work, stay at selected spots, be on duty, and live in collective dormitories, urging leading cadres at all levels to live among the masses as ordinary laborers, to lead the masses forward with their exemplary actions, to learn production laws from production practice, and to promote production development. This is a very important reason why the production outlook of the Gansu Metallurgical Company has changed so quickly.
    The comrades of the Lanzhou Refinery also have a deep understanding of this problem. Since 1964, this factory has implemented the "three fixings and one topping" system. The factory's leading comrades work one day a week at a fixed point and also stay at selected spots below. There is a Li Yongliang class in the factory, which is a famous backward class, with long-term disunity and constant accidents of all sizes. Later, the factory's leading cadres stayed at this class and worked with them. They stayed there for two whole months, starting with solving ideological problems and doing work bit by bit, and finally turned this class into an advanced class. The comrades of the Lanzhou Refinery said at the meeting: "In practice, we deeply feel that participating in labor and not separating ourselves from the struggle for production can enable us to understand the workers and production more deeply. When we work, we have a clear idea in our minds, we have many methods, and we can truly implement revolutionary leadership that is in line with the actual production of the enterprise and the actual thinking of the workers."
    To go deep into reality and truly "seek truth" in "facts," and to cultivate an honest and revolutionary style, leading cadres must be determined to carry out a revolution in enterprise management. At present, the management system and management system of many enterprises are incompatible with our party's revolutionary style and the current revolutionary situation. The first is that there are "many temples and many gods," with overlapping institutions, many relationships, and a lot of buck-passing. The second is that there are old rules, complicated philosophies, many books, and many rules. The third is that there are many meetings, many documents, and "many back-to-back leaders." With these three things, it is difficult to go down; and if you finally go down, you will be brought back up after three attempts and two attempts. It can be seen that without a revolution in enterprise management, the revolutionization of the leadership's style is not easy. This Northwest Region Industrial and Transportation Conference emphasized the revolution in enterprise management and introduced many successful experiences in this regard.
    Learn the Leadership Method of Bringing the Whole Area Forward from Points
    Grasping typical examples, establishing pacesetters, setting up models, bringing the whole area forward from points, breaking through one point, and promoting the overall situation is a leadership method that this meeting repeatedly emphasized. A leader of an enterprise who has learned this leadership method, is good at establishing models to guide the masses forward, and is good at summarizing typical experiences to promote the general, can make the masses always be in an uncalm revolutionary wave and make the mass movement continue to develop forward.
    Opposed to this leadership method of "bringing the whole area forward from points" is the general leadership method that stays on general appeals. A leader of an enterprise who cannot get rid of the general leadership method cannot use vivid examples to stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses to catch up and cannot have a mighty mass movement.
    The comrades of the Yumen Petroleum Administration introduced at the meeting their experience in using the leadership method of "bringing the whole area forward from points." They first widely mobilized the masses, starting with the university's "two-point theory," and comparing themselves with Daqing to find gaps. There are many ways to find gaps. Some compare their thoughts, work, and style in an all-round way; some deeply dig and find gaps in a project, a well, a piece of equipment, a product, or a thing; and some compare soldiers with soldiers, generals with generals, industries with industries, and types of work with types of work. Because the gaps are found deeply, carefully, and flexibly, the higher the emotions are found, the more restless they become, and the ambition and revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers to not be willing to lag behind and to catch up with the advanced are encouraged.
    After the masses are mobilized, it is necessary to put forward goals and guide the masses. At this time, the Yumen Petroleum Administration put forward a loud call to the broad masses of workers: all items are of excellent quality, all indicators are advanced, all things are politically in command, and everyone's skills are excellent, as the goal of learning from Daqing. The workers said: "There are standards for measuring work, and there is a goal for learning from Daqing."
    After the goals are put forward, leaders at all levels go deep into the grassroots, carve "Daqing-style" models, and cultivate "Wang Tie-man" style pacesetters, using models to guide the masses forward. In 1965, the Yumen Petroleum Administration carved a total of 35 "Daqing-style" models and cultivated 64 advanced figures, which were established as pacesetters for the overall situation.
    It is not easy to carve a truly excellent model. The Yumen Petroleum Administration emphasized five points: first, to be targeted and have a strong sense of purpose, to advocate what is needed based on the party's policies and needs of production work in various periods, so that what is established will become a trend; second, to stay at selected spots in a down-to-earth manner, the main methods of staying at selected spots are to come up with ideas to point out the direction, find faults to stimulate enthusiasm, and grasp the top students to summarize experiences; third, to give more guidance in work and not give special care in material, so that the models carved out are truly excellent and the masses are convinced; fourth, to divide the models into two, to vigorously publicize the achievements and experiences, and to strictly demand the shortcomings and problems; fifth, after the models are established, the leaders should directly link up with the models and constantly provide guidance.
    Establishing models is only the first step in leadership work. Then, it is necessary to publicize them vigorously, so that the image of advanced pacesetters is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, creating momentum, organizing the masses to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced, and help the backward. At this time, with models, the masses can see, touch, learn, and the mass movement will rise up enthusiastically, and leaders at all levels will also have the capital to guide the mass movement.
    Next, it is necessary to establish new models based on the problems exposed in the development of the mass movement to promote the further in-depth development of the mass movement.
    Finally, it is also necessary to use the "two-point theory" as a weapon to do a good job in summarizing and evaluating. Initial evaluation is done in the first half of the year, and a final evaluation is done at the end of the year; usually, production summaries and evaluations are also carried out on a monthly, quarterly basis, or after drilling a well or completing a project, to accumulate data for the initial evaluation and final evaluation. On this basis, we will vigorously grasp the mass commendation of good people and good deeds, establish new pacesetters, and focus on promoting a batch of advanced experiences, making the good people and good deeds thoroughly understood, making the pacesetters stand tall, promoting the advanced experiences widely, and drumming up the enthusiasm of the masses, laying the foundation for a new upsurge of the mass movement.
    This relatively systematic leadership method of "from points to the whole area" of the Yumen Petroleum Administration is actually the leadership method of Daqing; it is just that the Yumen Petroleum Administration has used it more skillfully and has begun to become their own experience. People can see from here that the leadership method of grasping typical examples, establishing pacesetters, setting up models, bringing the whole area forward from points, breaking through one point, and promoting the overall situation is such a revolutionary and dynamic leadership method. Only comrades who have learned this leadership method can always walk in front of the mass movement.

### 站到群众运动的前面来——西北区工业交通会议侧记

    站到群众运动的前面来
    ——西北区工业交通会议侧记
    第三个五年计划的大幕揭开，西北区工业交通战线上的各民族的职工，正意气风发地迎接新的艰巨的生产建设任务。听毛主席的话，走大庆的道路，摘掉西北工业落后的帽子，把西北建设成祖国强大的工业基地，是西北工人阶级的共同誓言。
    在新的形势、新的任务面前，在新的群众运动即将到来的时候，最重要的是什么？是领导。西北区工业交通会议号召各级领导站到群众运动的前面来，充分认识西北地区的社会主义建设已经进入一个新的发展时期，充分认识广大群众的革命积极性，充分认识生产的潜力，把西北地区的增产节约运动轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地开展起来。
    领导思想先要革命化
    领导的问题在哪里？领导的问题，首先是一个思想革命化的问题。
    “思想落后于形势，领导落后于群众”，这是会上各个地方和各个企业的领导干部谈得比较多的一个问题。什么是当前的形势？什么是群众的动向？会上认为：经过社会主义教育运动，广大群众阶级觉悟空前提高，他们当中蕴藏着的无穷无尽的潜力正在迸发出来，社会主义革命正以历史火车头的巨大作用，推动着社会主义建设事业蓬勃向前发展。这就是当前的形势，这就是群众的动向。
    这是一种大好的形势，也是一种逼人的形势。对于一个好的领导者来说，这正是大有作为的时候。会上，许多同志从自己的切身经验里得出一条结论：当着一个新的革命和建设时期到来的时候，如果领导认清了形势，站在群众的前面，能够把广大群众的积极性充分调动起来，形成声势浩大的群众运动，就会使我们的事业突飞猛进地向前发展。
    然而，面对着这样的形势，也有一些同志有无穷的忧虑。他们总怕群众起来以后“闯乱子”、“出问题”、“冒风险”。别人没有提出的问题，自己不敢想；别人没有做过的事情，自己不敢做；甚至别人提出过的问题，做过了的事情，自己也不敢想，不敢做。这样的同志，就落在群众的后面，从后面拖住了群众。
    甘肃冶金公司的一场“攻守之争”就是这样两种领导思想的斗争。这个企业经过社会主义教育运动以后，人们的精神面貌和生产面貌都有了很大的变化。在这种大好形势下，怎样巩固社会主义教育运动的成果呢？一种意见是“守成”，认为甘肃冶金公司好不容易翻了身，能守住就不错了；一种意见是“创业”，主张从前进中求巩固，从革命中求发展。
    甘肃冶金公司的同志认为前一种意见是错误的，按照这种意见去做，不但不能“守成”，还会有倒退的危险；后一种意见才是正确的。他们组织大家学习《将革命进行到底》，经过一个月的大鸣大放大讨论，统一了认识，进一步激发了革命精神，大家一致认为，当前的主要矛盾是：领导的思想作风落后于群众的革命干劲，基础工作落后于生产发展的需要，技术经济指标落后于革命形势的要求。于是，他们因势利导，把在尽可能短的时间内，赶上大庆，赶上国内外先进水平，作为奋斗目标，动员广大群众乘胜前进，迅速摘掉落后帽子。
    就在当年，这个原来还靠国家弥补亏损过日子的企业，给国家上缴了二千多万元利润，主要产品一年的产量比前两年的总产量还增加一倍。这以后，生产持续发展。在这次会上，甘肃冶金公司被评为西北区工业交通战线上二十面红旗之一。
    “攻守之争”的实质是什么呢？甘肃冶金公司的同志在会上说：“实质是我们在革命的形势面前，是敢于革命，敢于胜利，站在群众的前面领导群众前进呢？还是因循保守、故步自封，站在群众的后面拖群众的后腿呢？”
    这个问题是发人深思的。西北工业的面貌变化很大，特别是最近这几年，产品质量有很大的提高，品种有很大的增加，成本有很大的降低，数量也有很大的增长。许多同志认识到，只要敢于革命，敢于胜利，坚决站在群众前面领导群众前进，西北的工业是可以赶上先进水平的。但是，也有一些同志，只看到西北工业发展很快的一面，坐井观天，夜郎自大，不愿意再前进了。还有一些同志，只看到西北工业同先进水平相距还远的一面，垂头丧气，妄自菲薄，不敢再前进了。这两种看法都是形而上学的观点。领导思想革命化，就是首先要从领导思想上，清除这种不承认落后和甘心于落后的形而上学的观点，用总路线的精神来武装自己，鼓足干劲，力争上游，敢于革命，敢于胜利。
    老实人永远握有主动权
    做老实人，说老实话，办老实事，是西北区工业交通会议上很强调的一种领导作风。这样的人，在会上被称为“最可靠的人”、“最有希望的人”。只有这样的人，才能永远握有主动权，立于不败之地。
    什么叫老实？老实就是实事求是，就是一是一、二是二，就是根据事物的本来面目去认识事物，根据事物的客观规律去改造事物。这种领导作风，是辩证唯物主义的作风，是无产阶级革命者的作风。
    同这种革命的作风相对立的，是一种不大老实的作风。“赶行市”、“走过场”，是这种作风的典型表现。持这种作风的人，听见风，就是雨；别人说什么，自己也说什么；别人搞什么，自己也搞什么。结果，许多工作都是“走过场”，流于形式主义。
    为什么有些同志总是靠“赶行市”来领导生产呢？会议认为，这反映了我们有些企业的领导同志还没有深入下去。他们对自己的企业不甚了了。生产中究竟有什么问题，该提出什么任务，哪些工作应该先抓，哪些工作可以靠后，心中无数，只好“赶行市”行事。这种作风是群众运动的祸害。搞群众运动一定要老老实实、实事求是，从生产的实际出发，从群众的要求出发，提出切合实际的任务，引导群众前进。
    这里，一个关键问题是深入实际，真正在“实事”中“求是”，不下去，想说老实话也说不出来，想办老实事也办不成，想当老实人也当不成。近几年来，西北区工业交通企业的许多领导干部，坚持了参加劳动，坚持了蹲点，对这个问题体会很深。上面说到的甘肃冶金公司，百分之九十五的干部都参加劳动，他们还制订了领导干部学习、劳动、蹲点、值班、住集体宿舍等五项制度，督促各级领导干部以普通劳动者的姿态生活在群众之中，用自己的模范行动带领群众前进，从生产实践中摸生产规律，促进生产发展。甘肃冶金公司的生产面貌变得这么快，这是一个很重要的原因。
    兰州炼油厂的同志，对这个问题也有很深的体会。这个厂从一九六四年以来，实行了“三定一顶”制度，厂的领导同志每星期定点劳动一天，还到下面蹲点。厂里有个李永良班，是个有名的落后班，长期闹不团结，大小事故不断。后来，厂的领导干部在这个班上蹲点，和他们一起劳动，整整蹲了两个月，从解决思想问题入手，一点一滴做工作，终于把这个班变成了先进班。兰州炼油厂的同志在会上说：“我们在实践中深深感到，参加劳动，不脱离生产斗争，能使我们更深刻地了解工人，了解生产，做起工作来胸中有数，办法多，符合企业的生产实际和职工的思想实际，能真正实行革命化的领导。”
    领导干部要深入实际，真正在“实事”中“求是”，培养出老实的革命作风，就要下决心在企业管理上进行一场革命。现在许多企业的管理体制和管理制度，都是同我们党的革命作风和当前的革命形势不相适应的。第一条就是“庙多神多”，机构重叠，关系多，扯皮多。第二条就是陈规旧律，烦琐哲学，本本多，条条多。第三条就是会议多，文件多，“背靠背的领导多”。有了这三条，就很难下去了；好不容易下去了，三搞两搞，又给搞了上来。可见，不从企业管理上来一个革命，领导作风的革命化是不容易的。这次西北区工业交通会议，很强调企业管理革命，在这方面介绍了很多成功的经验。
    学会以点带面的领导方法
    抓典型，树标兵，立样板，以点带面，突破一点，推动全局，是这次会议反复强调的一种领导方法。一个企业的领导者学会了这种领导方法，善于树立样板引导群众前进，善于总结典型经验推动一般，才能使群众永远处于不平静的革命浪潮中，使群众运动不断地向前发展。
    同这种“以点带面”的领导方法相对立的，是那种停留在一般号召上的一般化的领导方法。一个企业的领导者摆脱不了一般化的领导方法，就不能用鲜明的榜样去激发广大群众奋起直追的革命热情，也就不可能有声势浩大的群众运动。
    玉门石油管理局的同志，在会上介绍了他们运用“以点带面”的领导方法的经验。他们首先是广泛发动群众，从大学“两分法”入手，对照大庆大找差距。找差距的方法很多。有对照思想、工作、作风全面找的；有针对一项工程、一口井、一台设备、一件产品、一件事情深挖细找的；也有兵对兵，将对将，行业对行业，工种对工种，挂上钩找的。由于差距找得深，找得细，找得活，越找情绪越高，越找越坐卧不安，把广大职工不甘落后、追赶先进的雄心壮志和革命精神鼓舞起来。
    群众发动起来后，就要提出奋斗目标，为群众指引方向。这时，玉门石油管理局向广大职工提出了响亮的战斗号召：项项质量全优，个个指标先进，事事政治挂帅，人人出手过硬，作为学赶大庆的奋斗目标。工人们说：“衡量工作有了杠杠，学赶大庆有了奔头。”
    奋斗目标提出来以后，各级领导深入基层，刻“大庆式”的样板，培养“王铁人”式的标兵，用样板引导群众前进。一九六五年，玉门石油管理局共刻了三十五个“大庆式”的样板，培养了六十四名先进人物，树为全局的标兵。
    要刻好一个真正过硬的样板，不是一件容易的事。玉门石油管理局强调了五点：第一、有的放矢，针对性强，根据党的各个时期的方针政策和生产工作的需要，提倡什么树什么，使得树了什么，什么就成风；第二、扎扎实实地蹲点，蹲点的主要方法是出点子指明方向，找岔子激发干劲，抓尖子总结经验；第三、工作上多给指导，物质上不特殊照顾，这样刻出的样板才真正过硬，群众才口服心服；第四、对样板要一分为二，成绩和经验要大力宣传，缺点和问题要从严要求；第五、样板树立起来以后，领导还要直接和样板挂钩，不断给予指导。
    树立了样板，这只是领导工作的第一步。接着就要大张旗鼓地宣传，使先进标兵的形象深入人心，造成声势，组织群众学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进。这时，有了样板，群众看得见、摸得到、学得到，群众运动就热火朝天地起来了，各级领导也有了指导群众运动的本钱。
    接下去，就要根据群众运动发展中暴露出来的问题，树立新的样板，推动群众运动进一步深入发展。
    最后，还要以“两分法”为武器，搞好总结评比。半年初评，年终总评；平时按月、按季，或者打完一口井、搞完一项工程，也进行生产总结评比，为初评和总评积累资料。在这个基础上，大抓群众性的表扬好人好事，树立新的标兵，集中推广一批先进经验，把好人好事讲得透透的，把标兵树得高高的，把先进经验推得广广的，把群众的劲头鼓得足足的，为群众运动的新的高潮打下基础。
    玉门石油管理局这一套比较系统的“由点到面”的领导方法，其实就是大庆的领导方法；只不过玉门石油管理局已经运用得比较熟练，开始成为他们自己的经验了。人们从这里可以看到，抓典型、树标兵、立样板，以点带面，突破一点，推动全局的领导方法，是一种多么富有革命朝气的领导方法。只有学会这种领导方法的同志，才能永远走在群众运动的前面。
