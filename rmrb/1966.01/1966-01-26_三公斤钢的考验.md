	The Test of Three Kilograms of Steel
	One day, two comrades from the Anshan City Hardware Products Factory and the Barber Tool Factory came to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron and Steel Research Institute, requesting them to smelt three kilograms of high-speed tool steel and make them into twist drills. The comrades at the research institute were in a difficult position. They had relatively large equipment, so how could they smelt three kilograms with such a small steelmaking furnace? But then they thought, since fraternal units were having difficulties, they couldn't just sit idly by, so they decided to smelt this kind of steel on the high-frequency electric furnace in the experimental workshop.
	Although they had never smelted such a small batch of steel before, the comrades in the steelmaking group were still very serious, carefully preparing the materials and meticulously operating the furnace to produce the high-speed tool steel. Foundry worker Jin Xijiang didn't even bother to eat lunch and rushed to make sandboxes. During the casting process, the leadership even assigned specialized technicians to provide guidance, and finally, thirteen twist drill blanks were cast.
	The two guests were very moved by this scene. They said, "We originally thought that such a large unit like yours wouldn't even look at our small factory's three kilograms of steel, but we didn't expect you to help us solve it so well."
	Thirteen small drill bits are a test for this research institute. Should this task be accepted or rejected? This is the question of whether to keep the difficulties for oneself or leave them to the users. If such a task isn't completed when there are conditions to do so, how can it be called wholeheartedly serving the people? The Iron and Steel Research Institute of Anshan Iron and Steel Company did a very good job. They got an "A+" in this test.

### 三公斤钢的考验

    三公斤钢的考验
    一天，鞍山市五金制品厂和理发工具厂的两位同志，来到鞍山钢铁公司钢铁研究所，要求给他们炼三公斤高速工具钢，并做成麻花钻头。研究所的同志为难了，他们这里都是一些比较大的设备，炼三公斤，哪有这么小的炼钢炉啊。但他们继而一想，既然兄弟单位有了困难，就不能坐视不管，就决定在试验工场的高频电炉上给炼这种钢。
    虽然他们从来没有炼过这么小批量的钢，可是炼钢组的同志依然十分认真，精心配料，细心操作，把高速工具钢炼了出来。铸工金锡江连午饭也没顾上吃，又给赶做了砂箱。在浇铸的时候，领导上还指定专门技术人员指导，最后终于铸出了十三根麻花钻头。
    这两位客人看到此情此景，十分感动，他们说：“本来我们寻思，你们这样大的单位，哪里看得上我们小厂这么三公斤钢，想不到你们帮我们解决得这么好。”
    十三个小钻头，是对这个研究所的一个考验。对这个任务，是接受还是拒绝？这就是把困难留给自己，还是把困难留给用户的问题。如果有条件而不完成这样的任务，怎能叫做全心全意为人民服务呢？鞍山钢铁公司钢铁研究所做得很好，他们在这次考验中得了“五分”。
