    "Serving whom" may be only four characters, but to truly understand it and put it into action is not easy. Chairman Mao said, "Our ranks are entirely for the liberation of the people, and are thoroughly working for the interests of the people." Every revolutionary should use the words "entirely" and "thoroughly" to measure themselves, to see what their "serving the people" thought is really like, and whether it meets this standard. This is a question of world view, a question of ideological transformation. As the revolutionary situation continues to develop, one must constantly transform one's own thinking to meet the needs of the revolutionary situation. "Serving whom" is a revolutionary's political soul; without a soul, where would the method come from?

    政治灵魂与工作方法
    “为谁服务”虽然只有四个字，但要真正理解它，并见之于行动，却很不容易。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我们每一个革命者都应该用“完全”“彻底”四个字来衡量一下，“为人民服务”的思想到底怎样？是否合乎这个标准。这是一个世界观的问题，是个思想改造的问题。革命形势不断向前发展，就得不断改造自己的思想，使之适应革命形势的需要。“为谁服务”是一个革命者的政治灵魂，没有灵魂那有方法呢？
