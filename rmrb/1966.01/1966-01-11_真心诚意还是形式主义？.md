    Sincerity or Formalism?
    Leading cadres must go among the masses to listen to their opinions in order to lead them well. This principle is easy to understand. However, implementing it seriously is not so simple. It is easy to hear correct words, positive words, good words, and to take them in; it is not so easy to hear unpleasant words, negative words, and yet be able to take them in. Taking them in is one thing; the result after hearing them is another.
    How to correctly listen to the opinions of the masses? This is a matter of Party spirit, and also a leadership art. With what attitude do we listen? Comrade Mao Yuren proposed that we listen with “sincerity” and not with “formalism.” If we treat the masses with sincerity, the masses will treat us with sincerity and pour out what is in their hearts for us to hear. Some county committee leaders, on the surface, also solicit the opinions of the masses, but in reality, they still impose their own "framework" on the masses. With this attitude of listening to the opinions of the masses, the masses will certainly not tell you the truth. Of course, to listen to all the opinions and demands of the masses without analysis, to not persuade or educate about incorrect opinions, but to let them be, is not an attitude of being responsible to the masses, that is tailism.
    To listen to the words of the masses in this way, and not in that way, seems to be a matter of work style and work method. Comrade Mao Yuren realized from his own personal experience that this is essentially a matter of standpoint and viewpoint, namely: whether to believe in the masses or only believe in oneself; whether to place oneself among the masses or above the masses; whether to serve the masses or to have the masses serve oneself. If this fundamental problem is not solved, it is impossible to hear the voices of the masses and impossible to realize the revolutionization of the county committee leadership. Once the fundamental problem is solved, the methods and channels for listening to the opinions of the masses will naturally increase.
    The mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" is the fundamental line of our Party. How is this line to be followed? How should the county committee leaders position themselves in relation to the masses? How should they listen to the words of the masses? Is it with sincerity or with formalism? These questions are closely linked to revolutionization and are worth pondering carefully.

### 真心诚意还是形式主义？

    真心诚意还是形式主义？
    领导干部要领导好群众，必须到群众中去听取群众的意见。这道理好懂。可是认真执行起来，就不那么简单。正确的话，正面的话，好话，容易听，听得进去；不好听的话，反面的话，也要听，而且能听进去就不大容易。听进去，是一回事；听后的结果，又是另一回事。
    如何正确听取群众的意见？这是个党性问题，也是个领导艺术。用什么态度去听？毛育人同志提出，要“真心诚意”地听，不要“形式主义”地听。对群众以诚相待，群众对我们也就会以诚对诚，把心底里的话都掏出来，说给我们听。有的县委领导同志，表面看去，也征求群众的意见，实际上还是把自己的“框框”强加于群众。用这种态度去听群众的意见，群众必然不会对你说真心话。当然，对群众的意见和要求，不加分析地一概都听，对不正确的意见，不说服也不教育，听之任之，也不是对群众负责的态度，那是尾巴主义。
    听群众的话，要这样听，不要那样听，看来是工作作风和工作方法问题，毛育人同志从自己的切身体会中认识到，这实质是一个立场观点问题，即：是相信群众，还是只相信自己；是把自己放在群众之中，还是放在群众之上；是为群众服务，还是要群众为自己服务。这个根本问题不解决，是无法听到群众的心声、无法实现县委领导革命化的。根本问题解决了，听取群众意见的方法、途径自然也就多了。
    “从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，是我们党的根本路线。这条路线怎么走法？县委领导同志与群众的位置是怎样摆的？是怎样去听群众的话的？是真心诚意地听还是形式主义地听？这些问题与革命化是紧紧相连的，值得好好思索。
