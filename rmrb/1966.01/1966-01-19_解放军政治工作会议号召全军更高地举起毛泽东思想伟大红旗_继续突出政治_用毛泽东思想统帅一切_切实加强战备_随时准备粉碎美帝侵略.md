    The PLA Political Work Conference Calls on the Entire Army to Hold Higher the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
    Continue to Emphasize Politics and Use Mao Zedong Thought to Command Everything
    Resolutely Strengthen War Preparedness and Be Ready at Any Time to Smash US Imperialist Aggression
    Emphasizing politics is the foundation for strengthening the revolutionization and modernization of our army, the foundation for preparing to smash the war of aggression by US imperialism, and the foundation for opposing and preventing modern revisionism and ensuring that our army never changes its nature. Strengthening war preparedness is a long-term strategic task. We must prepare for US imperialism to fight early and to fight big, and we must base all our work on the word "fight." As long as we emphasize politics, we will be invincible.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently convened a political work conference of the entire army in Beijing. The conference earnestly studied the important instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao regarding army building and political work, studied how to implement the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao on continuing to emphasize politics in five aspects, comprehensively summarized the experience of political work over the past two years, and arranged the political work for 1966. The conference called on all commanders and fighters of the army to unite closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to continue to emphasize politics and resolutely implement the five principles! Strive to strengthen war preparedness and be ready at any time to smash the aggression of US imperialism!
    During the conference, Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen and other comrades received all the attendees. Comrades Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen respectively made important reports to the conference on the current domestic and international situation and tasks. Comrade Ye Jianying spoke at the meeting. The care and instructions of the central responsible comrades are a great impetus to the construction and political work of our army, and gave the comrades present a profound education and great encouragement.
    Xiao Hua, Director of the General Political Department, presided over the conference and made a report on the issue of implementing the five principles of emphasizing politics. Yang Chengwu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, spoke at the meeting. The conference discussed the New Year's Day editorial of the *Liberation Army Daily* in 1966, and also discussed two documents proposed by the General Political Department on continuing to emphasize politics and carrying out the "Four Good" Company Movement.
    The conference believes that since the troops implemented Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics, a new upsurge of mass study and application of Chairman Mao's works has been set off throughout the army. The broad masses of cadres and fighters have a deeper class feeling for Mao Zedong Thought, and a higher consciousness of transforming their thinking and guiding their actions according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Good people and good deeds in the style of Lei Feng and Wang Jie have emerged in large numbers, and the "Four Good" Company Movement has made new progress. Outstanding achievements have been made in combat, training and completion of various tasks. The conference also examined the shortcomings and existing problems in political work, and believes that further efforts are needed to greatly emphasize politics and truly implement the five principles.
    Through the positive and negative experiences in the past two years of practice, the comrades present further realized the great strategic significance of emphasizing politics. Emphasizing politics is proposed by Comrade Lin Biao in accordance with Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, based on the historical experience of our army and the current situation, based on the law of development of socialist society and the economic foundation of socialist society, and based on the fact that classes and class struggles still exist in socialist society. Emphasizing politics is the foundation for strengthening the revolutionization and modernization of our army, the foundation for preparing to smash the war of aggression by US imperialism, and the foundation for opposing and preventing modern revisionism and ensuring that our army never changes its nature. The five principles for continuing to emphasize politics put forward by Comrade Lin Biao are not only the general guidelines and general tasks for the various tasks of our army in 1966, but also a century-old plan for the construction of our army. It is necessary to repeatedly publicize the great significance of emphasizing politics, constantly summarize experience in practice, clarify various vague understandings, and improve the consciousness of all personnel in the army to emphasize politics.
    The comrades present deeply realized that emphasizing politics means emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, that is, taking Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for all tasks of the army, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. No matter what we do, we must take Chairman Mao's instructions as the standard. At any time, we must firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever Chairman Mao instructs, we must resolutely support it, resolutely do it, and guarantee its completion even if we go up the mountain of knives or down into a sea of fire. Whatever violates Chairman Mao's instructions, we must resolutely resist and resolutely oppose. In studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, we must especially make great efforts in the word "use." Whether Mao Zedong Thought has been truly learned depends first of all on whether it is used, whether it is truly used or falsely used, and whether it can stand the test. Our attitude towards anyone must be to listen to their words and observe their actions, mainly to observe their actions. "Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao" should be done not only by soldiers and grass-roots cadres, but also by senior cadres. We must study Chairman Mao's works and transform our thinking for the rest of our lives.
    The conference pointed out that in order to continue to emphasize politics and resolutely implement the five principles, the entire army must hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a new upsurge of more extensive and deeper study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Party committees and leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in learning well. We must implement the mass line and develop the three major democracies. We must ensure that Chairman Mao's instructions, the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines, and the instructions of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao directly meet with the broad masses of cadres and fighters and become the conscious actions of the masses. We must mobilize cadres and fighters to do political and ideological work, not only political cadres, but also military cadres and other cadres. We must implement the five principles in the "Four Good" Company Movement and vigorously grasp living ideas. We must advocate the working method of dialectical materialism, go deep into reality, investigate and study, master the weapon of dividing one into two, conduct specific analysis of things, and adopt different methods to deal with different problems. We must make ideological work lively, thorough, and into the hearts of every soldier. We must use political work methods and persuasive education methods to carry out management and education. The "Double Eight Articles" of respecting cadres and loving soldiers in the company management and education regulations must be repeatedly implemented. Leading organs must learn from a certain regiment's method of grasping living ideas in sixty "how to do" cases and help companies summarize the experience of grasping living ideas.
    The conference emphasized that the key to emphasizing politics lies in the leadership of the Party. We must implement the policy of the whole Party running the army, resolutely implement the dual leadership system of the military system and local Party committees over the army under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, place the army under the absolute leadership of the Party and the supervision of the people, and ensure the implementation of the Party's line, principles and policies in the army. We must strengthen Party building in accordance with Chairman Mao's thinking on Party building, strengthen the collective leadership of Party committees, adhere to the Party's democratic centralism, invigorate Party life, carry out criticism and self-criticism, develop democracy, pool the wisdom and efforts of the masses, and do a good job in army work. We must strengthen the building of the cadre contingent and the building of Party branches to ensure the implementation of the five principles organizationally. Party committees and political organs at all levels must vigorously strengthen political and ideological leadership over the troops and control the emphasis on politics.
    The conference especially emphasized that we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to make progress, while conceit makes one lag behind," and always be modest and prudent, be honest people, tell the truth, and do honest things. Never be arrogant and complacent, and never be self-important. If we have made achievements in our work, we must give credit to the Party and the masses, and not put the credit on our own account. We must learn from the local areas even better and learn all the good ideas, good styles, good experiences, and good methods of local work.
    The conference called on all comrades in the army to raise their vigilance a hundredfold and earnestly strengthen war preparedness. At present, US imperialism is shifting its strategic focus to Asia, frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, and pointing its spearhead of aggression at our country. Modern revisionists are serving US imperialism even more vilely and shamelessly, thereby intensifying the danger of war. All comrades in the army must realize that as long as imperialism is not overthrown and capitalism is not eliminated, the roots of war will always exist. US imperialism persists in being hostile to the Chinese people and the people of the world. It always wants to impose war on the Chinese people and compete with us. Therefore, strengthening war preparedness is not a temporary measure, but a long-term strategic task. We must not only defend the motherland and be ready at any time to smash the aggression of US imperialism, but also resolutely support the struggle of other countries against US imperialism. This is our unshirkable internationalist obligation. We must fully prepare for the war of aggression against US imperialism, prepare for it to fight early, fight big, fight a nuclear war, fight all kinds of wars, and fight on several fronts. We must base all our work on the word "fight." We must not only do a good job in the construction of the army, but also, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, do a good job in the implementation of the three aspects of militia work. We firmly believe that as long as we emphasize politics, make the atmosphere of studying Mao Zedong Thought strong, raise proletarian consciousness high, boost morale fully, do a good job in unity, deepen hatred for the enemy, and develop the revolutionary heroic spirit of daring to revolt, daring to struggle, not fearing war, and not fearing sacrifice, we will be invincible. If US imperialism dares to attack us, our soldiers will be like "little tigers," one top several, dozens of. Our troops will be like iron hammers, and wherever they smash, they will be crushed. We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely with the people of the country, and the people of the world, a few US imperialism is not enough to fight, the final victory must be ours.
    The conference pointed out that this year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan, and it will also be a year of rapid development in industry, agriculture, and all aspects of construction. We must hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, implement the "Four Goods," strengthen war preparedness, resolutely implement the five principles, go all out, aim high, use new and greater achievements to answer the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's concern for the army, and victoriously complete all the tasks assigned to us by the motherland and the people.
    This conference lasted for twenty days and ended on January 18.
    Responsible comrades for political work from military units above the army level, including the army, navy, air force, public security forces, institutions of higher learning, and scientific research institutions, and some division political commissars attended the conference.

    解放军政治工作会议号召全军更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    继续突出政治　用毛泽东思想统帅一切
    切实加强战备　随时准备粉碎美帝侵略
    突出政治是加强我军革命化、现代化建设的根本，是做好粉碎美帝侵略战争准备工作的根本，是反对和防止现代修正主义、保证我军永不变质的根本加强战备是一个长期的战略任务。我们要准备美帝国主义早打大打，要把全部工作的立脚点放在“打”字上。只要突出了政治，我们就会无敌于天下
    新华社十八日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近在北京召开了全军政治工作会议。会议认真学习了党中央、毛主席关于军队建设和政治工作的重要指示，研究了如何贯彻执行林彪同志关于继续突出政治的五项原则的指示，全面地总结了两年来的政治工作的经验，安排了一九六六年的政治工作。会议号召：全军指战员要紧紧地团结在党中央、毛主席的周围，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为继续突出政治、坚决执行五项原则而斗争！为加强战备、随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的侵略而斗争！
    会议期间，党和国家领导人周恩来、朱德、邓小平、彭真等同志接见了出席会议的全体人员。周恩来同志、邓小平同志和彭真同志分别向会议作了关于当前国内外形势和任务的重要报告。叶剑英同志在会上讲了话。中央负责同志的关怀和指示，对我军建设和政治工作是极大的推动，给到会同志以深刻的教育和巨大的鼓舞。
    总政治部主任萧华主持了这次会议，作了关于贯彻执行突出政治五项原则问题的报告。副总参谋长杨成武在会上讲了话。会议讨论了《解放军报》一九六六年元旦社论，还讨论了总政治部提出的关于继续突出政治和开展四好连队运动的两个文件。
    会议认为，部队贯彻执行林彪同志突出政治的指示以来，全军掀起了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。广大干部战士对毛泽东思想的阶级感情更深了，按照毛主席的指示改造思想、指导行动的自觉性更高了。雷锋、王杰式的好人好事大量涌现，四好连队运动有了新的发展。在作战、训练和完成各项任务中都作出了出色的成绩。会议还检查了政治工作中的缺点和存在的问题，认为还需要继续努力，大大突出政治，使五项原则真正落实。
    到会同志通过两年来实践中正反两面的经验，进一步认识了突出政治的伟大战略意义。突出政治是林彪同志遵照毛主席的历来教导，根据我军的历史经验和当前情况提出来的，是根据社会主义社会发展规律和社会主义社会的经济基础提出来的，是根据社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争的事实提出来的。突出政治是加强我军革命化、现代化建设的根本，是做好粉碎美帝国主义侵略战争准备工作的根本，是反对和防止现代修正主义、保证我军永不变质的根本。林彪同志提出的继续突出政治的五项原则，不仅是我军一九六六年各项工作的总方针、总任务，而且是我军建设的百年大计。要反复宣传突出政治的伟大意义，在实践中不断总结经验，澄清各种模糊认识，提高全军人员对突出政治的自觉性。
    到会同志深刻地认识到，突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想，就是把毛主席的书当作全军各项工作的最高指示，就是用毛泽东思想来统率一切。不管干什么事情，都要以毛主席指示为标准。不论在任何时候，对毛泽东思想都要坚信不疑。凡是毛主席指示的，就要坚决拥护，坚决照办，上刀山下火海也要保证完成。凡是违背毛主席指示的，就要坚决抵制，坚决反对。活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫。是否把毛泽东思想真正学到手，首先要看学了用不用，是真用还是假用，是否经得起考验。我们对待任何人，必须听其言，观其行，主要是观其行。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，不仅战士和基层干部要这样办，高级干部更要这样办。我们干一辈子革命，就要学习一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想。
    会议指出，为了继续突出政治，坚决执行五项原则，全军一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起一个更广泛、更深入的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。各级党委和领导干部首先要带头学好。一定要贯彻执行群众路线，发扬三大民主。要使毛主席的指示、党中央的方针政策以及军委和林彪同志的指示，直接和广大干部战士见面，变成群众的自觉行动。要发动干部战士人人做政治思想工作，不仅政治干部要做，军事干部和其他干部都要做。一定要把五项原则落实到四好连队运动中去，大抓狠抓活思想。要提倡辩证唯物论的工作方法，深入实际，调查研究，掌握一分为二的武器，对事物进行具体分析，针对不同问题采取不同的方法处理。要把思想工作做活，做到家，做到每个战士的心坎上。要用政治工作的方法，说服教育的方法，来进行管理教育。连队管理教育工作条例中尊干爱兵的双八条，要反复落实。领导机关要学习某团抓活思想六十个“怎么办”的方法，帮助连队总结抓活思想的经验。
    会议强调指出，要突出政治关键在于党的领导。一定要贯彻全党办军的方针，坚决执行在党中央统一领导下的军事系统和地方党委对军队的双重领导制度，把军队置于党的绝对领导和人民群众的监督之下，保证党的路线、方针和政策在军队中贯彻执行。要按照毛主席的建党思想加强党的建设，加强党委的集体领导，坚持党的民主集中制，活跃党的生活，开展批评和自我批评，发扬民主，群策群力，把军队工作搞好。要加强干部队伍的建设和党支部的建设，从组织上保证五项原则的落实。各级党委和政治机关要大力加强对部队的政治思想领导，把好突出政治的关。
    会议特别强调，一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，永远谦虚谨慎，当老实人，说老实话，做老实事。决不要骄傲自大，决不要翘尾巴。工作有了成绩，要归功于党，归功于群众，不要把功劳记在自己账上。要更好地向地方学习，把地方工作的好思想，好作风，好经验，好方法都学过来。
    会议要求全军同志，必须百倍提高警惕，切实加强战备。目前美帝国主义正在把它的战略重点转移到亚洲，疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，并且把侵略的矛头指向我国。现代修正主义者更加卑鄙无耻地为美帝国主义效劳，从而加剧了战争的危险。全军同志必须认识，帝国主义不打倒，资本主义不消灭，战争的根源总是存在的。美帝国主义坚持与我国人民为敌，坚持与世界人民为敌，它总是想把战争强加到我国人民头上，同我们较量一场。因此，加强战备不是一个临时性的措施，而是一个长期的战略任务。我们不仅要保卫祖国，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，而且要坚决支援别国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，这是我们义不容辞的国际主义义务。我们要充分做好反对美帝国主义侵略战争的准备工作，准备它早打、大打、打核战争、打各种战争、在几条战线上打，我们要把全部工作的立脚点放在“打”字上。不仅要把军队的建设搞好，而且要在地方党委的统一领导下，搞好民兵工作三落实。我们坚信，只要我们突出了政治，把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把无产阶级觉悟提得高高的，把士气鼓得足足的，把团结搞得好好的，把对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，发扬敢于革命、敢于斗争，不怕战争、不怕牺牲的革命英雄主义精神，我们就会无敌于天下。如果美帝国主义胆敢向我们进攻，我们的战士就个个象“小老虎”一样，一个顶几个、几十个。我们的部队就会象铁锤一样，砸到那里，那里就被粉碎。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来，紧紧地和全国人民在一起，和全世界人民在一起，个把美帝国主义是不够打的，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    会议指出，今年是我国第三个五年计划开始的第一年，也将是工农业和各方面建设飞跃发展的一年。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，落实四好，加强战备，把五项原则坚决贯彻下去，鼓足干劲，力争上游，用新的更大的成绩来回答党中央和毛主席对军队的关怀，胜利地完成祖国和人民交给我们的一切任务。
    这次会议历时二十天，于一月十八日结束。
    陆海空军、公安部队、高等院校、科学研究机关等军以上单位的政治工作负责同志和部分师政治委员出席了这次会议。
