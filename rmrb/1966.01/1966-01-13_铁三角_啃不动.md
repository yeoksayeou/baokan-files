    “Iron Triangle” Cannot Be Gnawed Through
    About eight thousand invading American troops, along with their Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, barged into the "Iron Triangle" near Saigon to conduct a "sweep." They妄想 (wangxiang - vainly hoped) to find the main force of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, encircle and annihilate them, and return with a "clean sweep." But what was the result? Please see the following report from the Associated Press reporter:
    Some American officers are extremely disappointed with the "Operation Sweep," the largest operation in the Vietnam War, because, so far, the results are no better than those of similar-scale operations frequently organized by the Vietnamese (referring to the puppet army) in the past.
    These large-scale operations organized by the Vietnamese have often been severely criticized by American advisors because the goals of these operations were too large and the scale too big, and the command was ineffective.
    Now, the same criticism has been leveled against "Operation Sweep."
    For many years, people have known that this area has a vast network of tunnels and trenches. It is not new to discover them. These tunnels can withstand the bombing of bombs, dynamite, and are not afraid of the release of poison gas.
    One officer said: "We can't even begin to demolish this entire facility. This work will take several weeks, and we can't stay here that long."
    Three days later, about eight thousand allied troops realized they had been tricked by the enemy, but they were helpless about it.
    Although no large Viet Cong force was found, there were many snipers in the area. For three whole days, they killed one allied soldier after another. The bullets came from the houses that had been burned earlier.
    When the allied forces returned through this area, a sniper would crawl out of a tunnel that had been destroyed the day before. The snipers are playing a game of hide-and-seek. (Attached picture)

### “铁三角”啃不动

    “铁三角”啃不动
    侵越美军伙同澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军约八千人，闯进西贡附近的“铁三角”进行
  “扫荡”，他们妄想找到南越人民武装主力，进行围攻，“席卷”而归，可是结果如何呢？请看下面的美联社记者的报道：
    一些美国军官对越南战争中规模最大的行动“席卷行动”感到极为失望，因为，到现在为止，结果并不比越南人（指伪军）过去经常组织的、规模相似的行动的结果好一些。
    越南人组织的这些大规模的行动时常遭到美国顾问的严厉批评，因为这些行动的目标太大，而且规模太大，指挥不灵。
    现在，对“席卷行动”也提出了同样的批评。
    多年来人们就知道这个地区有庞大的地道网和壕沟。发现它们并不新奇。这些地道经得住炸弹、炸药的轰炸，也不怕施放毒气。
    一位军官说：“我们甚至无法着手捣毁这整个设施。这项工作要花几个星期的时间，我们在这里不能呆那么长的时间。”
    三天以后，八千人左右的盟军知道上了敌人的当，但是他们对此毫无办法。
    虽然未能发现大股的越共，但是在这个地区有许多狙击手。整整三天来，他们打死了一个又一个的盟军。子弹是从早些时候焚毁的房子里发出来的。
    当盟军回来经过这个地区的时候，从前一天被炸毁的地道里会钻出一名狙击手来。狙击手们在玩捉迷藏的把戏。（附图片）
