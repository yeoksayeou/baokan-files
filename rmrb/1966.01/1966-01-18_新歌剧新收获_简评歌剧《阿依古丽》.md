    New Opera, New Harvest
    —A Brief Review of the Opera "Ayiguli"
    Shi Lemeng
    The opera "Ayiguli," adapted by the Opera Troupe of the Central Opera and Dance Drama Theater from the film "Red Flowers on the Tianshan Mountains," is one of the new achievements made by our country's music workers in recent years in further revolutionizing themselves, implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, and carrying out the Party's literary and artistic line. "Ayiguli" reflects the class struggle of our fraternal nationality—the Kazakhs—in the socialist revolution, and reveals the spiritual outlook of the heroic people represented by Ayiguli, who are dedicated to the collective and the cause of socialism. It provides valuable experience for the development of our opera art with its new ideological content and spiritual temperament.
    To make musical art a weapon of thought for class education and revolutionary struggle among the masses, it must not only have a national and mass language foundation in the artistic aspect, but also have revolutionary creativity and innovation. The people's musical vocabulary is the richest, most vivid, and lively. The composers of "Ayiguli" have worked hard in this regard. They have spent a long time and extensively studied the music of our fraternal nationalities such as the Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and Kyrgyz, which is very meaningful.
    In order to fully reflect reality, the authors have closely grasped the important links of class struggle and the struggle between new and old ideas, and strived to make its artistic form popular among the broad masses. They have widely used and transformed the folk music of various fraternal nationalities in Xinjiang. Although the music of "Ayiguli" does not have the rigorous dramatic structure and relatively rich expressive means like traditional Han Chinese opera music, it is popular and moving. Here, the material does not replace creation, and traditional folk music has been reborn, becoming a sharp weapon serving proletarian politics.
    Ayiguli is the first female production team leader on the Kazakh grassland who has grown up under the cultivation of the Party. She has a fiery red heart, loves the Party and Chairman Mao, loves the collective and socialism. Since she was elected as the team leader, production has achieved a bumper harvest. However, the class enemy Hasimu has tried every means to carry out sabotage activities, and a few backward masses also believe that "a mother goose cannot fly far leading the flock" and oppose Ayiguli. Her husband, Asihar, under the control of capitalist spontaneous ideas, was even used by the enemy to quarrel with her and leave. But she stood firm, with clear love and hate. With the help of Secretary Liu of the commune and Father Wu Meier, and the support of the broad masses, she finally overcame numerous difficulties, defeated the class enemy, educated the backward masses, and made her husband realize the path he should take. In reflecting this sharp and complex class struggle intertwined with internal contradictions among the people, the authors strived to give each character and action a distinct personality in order to shape accurate musical images. In terms of vocal creation, such as the first singing when Ayiguli appears in the first scene, the expression of feelings for the Party and the new society is profound. Here, the author did not use startling tones, dynamics, and colors, nor did he use techniques that are divorced from content and meaningless. Instead, he used simple and popular musical language with national characteristics to display the inner world of a new generation of socialist people, successfully shaping the image of Ayiguli. The singing in the fourth scene, "Storms rise on Sailimu Lake...", to a large extent rejected the format of Western "aria" that is not suitable for our people, and replaced it with the technique of lyrical songs, achieving a simple and moving effect. In Ayiguli's "You have taken the wrong path...", the author tried to replace "recitative" with recitative. Asihar's "Leaving the yurt..." and the singing of Father Wu Meier criticizing Asihar in the fifth scene also have certain elements of traditional opera music.
    The choruses in many places are also written excellently, such as the chorus in the third scene caused by selling grass (including solos and instrumental music); the praise of society by the girls in front of Ayiguli's house at night in the fourth scene; and the chorus of a few old people with feudal superstition who were used by the enemy to demand Ayiguli's resignation. The life situations reflected are accurate, and the images are convincing.
    Regarding the class enemy Hasimu, although there are not many places where vocal music is used to portray him, judging from the instrumental writing, the author avoided the grotesque, superficial, and formulaic practices that usually occur when describing negative characters, which lack the power to move people, and achieved success. For example, the music when Hasimu gives Asihar a whip in the second scene—the simple use of plucked strings and string tremolos, and the strong contrast between the brass and cello when Hasimu instigates and provokes Asihar and then sees him off and enters the house—is very musical and vivid: it reveals not only Hasimu's sinister and vicious side, but also the sinister and fearful mood of this class enemy surrounded by revolutionary people. In addition, in many other places, such as the "election" in the first scene and the finale, the instrumental writing, whether in terms of tone or language, has strengthened the emotional depth of the new people of the socialist era due to obvious national and local characteristics.
    In terms of singing, the solos of Ayiguli, Asihar, Wu Meier, and Hasimu, as well as the choruses of the masses, express love and hate strongly, clearly, simply, and sincerely. Ayiguli and Asihar stand out more prominently in terms of the integrity of image shaping and development.
    In the past, although we have also had some operas that expressed the life of fraternal nationalities, due to the fact that some authors were divorced from life and did not closely integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, most of them were based on folk tales and myths, lacking both strong contemporary feelings and clear class viewpoints. Naturally, it was impossible to use traditional musical materials with a revolutionary and creative attitude to shape vivid and exciting musical images. "Ayiguli," on the other hand, has grasped the fundamental task of the current socialist revolution, and through specific life plots and character images, powerfully reveals the theme of class struggle in current social life and prominently expresses the power of the people. The music's portrayal of the struggle is relatively deep, and the shaping of the images of the revolutionary people is distinct.
    Opera music creation must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Creative personnel must constantly transform their subjective world in the process of delving into life struggles and conducting creation. In the artistic aspect, it should be based on the excellent traditions of national musical art and based on the aesthetic standards of contemporary new people. But it must also be pointed out that traditional tones, languages, and materials are not the only elements of nationalization and popularization. The same material can produce works of many different styles. Therefore, the nationalization and popularization of musical works must be based on all means such as the melody, group structure, harmony, rhythm, and formal structure of the music. "Ayiguli" music still has certain shortcomings in these aspects, that is: whenever the author's thoughts and feelings are consistent with the masses, and he wholeheartedly tries to reveal this feeling with musical images, its moving power is strong; when the author's aesthetic point of view is consistent with the masses, and he tries to verify this point of view with musical images, its artistic brilliance is novel and radiant. Conversely, if the two deviate slightly, the distance from the people is widened in terms of emotional content and artistic form, thereby weakening the emotional depth and ideological strength of the work. The music, lyrics, composition, and singing of "Ayiguli" are generally successful, but there are still some "Europeanized" traces. We congratulate the success of the creation and performance of "Ayiguli," and at the same time hope that it will continue to improve in the process of performance. (Attached picture)

    新歌剧新收获
    ——简评歌剧《阿依古丽》
    时乐蒙
    中央歌剧舞剧院歌剧团根据电影《天山的红花》改编的歌剧《阿依古丽》，是近几年来我国音乐工作者进一步革命化，贯彻毛主席的文艺思想、执行党的文艺路线所取得的新的成果之一。《阿依古丽》反映了我们兄弟民族——哈萨克族在社会主义革命中的阶级斗争，揭示了以阿依古丽为代表的、献身于集体、献身于社会主义事业的英雄人民的精神面貌。它以新的思想内容与精神气质为我们歌剧艺术的发展提供了有益的经验。
    要使音乐艺术成为对群众进行阶级教育与革命斗争的思想武器，在艺术方面不仅要具有民族的、群众的语言基础，还须有革命性的创造与革新。人民的音乐语汇是最丰富、生动活泼的，《阿依古丽》的曲作者在这方面是下了苦功的，他们长时间地、大量地学习了我国哈萨克族、维吾尔族、柯尔克孜族等兄弟民族的音乐，这是很有意义的。
    作者为了充分反映现实，紧紧抓住了阶级斗争与新旧思想斗争这些重要环节，并力求其艺术形式为广大群众所喜闻乐见，他们广泛地运用和改造了新疆各兄弟民族的民间音乐。《阿依古丽》的音乐虽不象汉族传统戏剧音乐那样具有严谨的戏剧性结构和比较丰富的表现手段，但是通俗动人的。这里，素材没有代替创作，传统的民间音乐得到了新生，变成为无产阶级政治服务的锋利武器。
    阿依古丽是在党的培养下成长起来的哈萨克草原上第一个女生产队长，她有一颗火红的心，热爱党和毛主席，热爱集体和社会主义，自从她当选为队长之后，生产获得了丰收。但是阶级敌人哈思木却千方百计进行阴谋破坏活动，少数落后群众也认为“母雁领头飞不远”反对阿依古丽。她的丈夫阿斯哈尔，在资本主义自发思想的支配下，竟被敌人利用和她闹翻出走。但她立场坚定，爱憎分明，在公社刘书记和乌卖尔老爹的帮助及广大群众的支持下，终于克服了重重困难，战胜了阶级敌人，教育了落后群众，并使自己丈夫认清了应该走的道路。在反映这场尖锐复杂的敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾交炽在一起的阶级斗争时，作者为了塑造准确的音乐形象，力图给每个人物及行动赋予鲜明的个性。在声乐创作方面，如第一场阿依古丽出场时的第一段歌唱，对党及新社会的感情表达是深刻的。这里作者既没有采用令人惊愕的音调、力度与色彩，也没有采用脱离内容、毫无意义的技巧，而是以具有民族特色的朴素、通俗的音乐语言，展示出了一代社会主义新人的内心世界，成功地塑造了阿依古丽的形象。第四场“赛里木湖畔起风浪……”的一段歌唱，也在很大程度上排斥了与我国人民不相适应的西洋“咏叹调”的格式，而代之以抒情曲的手法，取得了平易动人的效果。阿依古丽的“你走错了路……”作者试图以说唱性来代替“宣叙调”，阿斯哈尔的“离开毡房……”及第五场乌卖尔老爹批评阿斯哈尔的歌唱等段落，也都具有一定的戏曲音乐因素。
    许多地方的合唱也是写得出色的，如第三场由于卖草而引起斗争的合唱（包括独唱及器乐）；第四场夜晚，姑娘们在阿依古丽家门口对社会的歌颂，以及少数有封建迷信思想的老人，被敌人利用要求阿依古丽辞职的合唱等，所反映的生活情境是准确的，形象是有说服力的。
    关于阶级敌人哈思木，用声乐刻划的地方虽不太多，但结合器乐的写作来看，作者避免了在描写反面人物时通常产生的缺乏感人力量的怪诞化、表面化、公式化的做法，而取得了成功。如第二场哈思木送鞭子给阿斯哈尔时的音乐——单纯的拨弹与弦乐震音的使用，以及哈思木对阿斯哈尔进行煽动、挑拨后，送他出门，转家进房时的强烈的铜管与大提琴的对比，音乐性、形象性是很强的：既揭示出了哈思木阴险毒辣的一面，也揭示出了这个处于革命人群包围之中的阶级敌人的鬼祟惊恐的心情。另外，在其它许多地方，如第一场的“选举”和尾声等段器乐的写作，不论从音调、语言等方面，都由于明显的民族特点与地方特点而加强了社会主义时代新人的感情深度。
    在演唱方面，阿依古丽、阿斯哈尔、乌卖尔、哈思木的独唱以及群众的合唱对爱憎感情的抒发是强烈、鲜明、朴素、真挚的。在形象塑造与发展的完整性方面，阿依古丽与阿斯哈尔表现得更为突出。
    过去我们虽也曾出现过一些表现兄弟民族生活的歌剧，但由于有的作者脱离生活，没有和工农兵紧密结合，因而多取材于民间故事、神话传说，既缺乏强烈的时代感情，也缺乏明确的阶级观点，自然也就不可能以革命创造性的态度来运用传统音乐素材，塑造出生动活泼、激动人心的音乐形象。而《阿依古丽》则抓住了当前社会主义革命的根本任务，通过具体的生活情节与人物形象，有力地揭示了当前社会生活中阶级斗争的主题，突出地表现了人民的力量。音乐对斗争的刻划是较深入的，对革命人民群众形象的塑造是鲜明的。
    歌剧音乐创作，必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，创作人员在深入生活斗争和进行创作的过程中要不断改造自己的主观世界。艺术方面应该以民族音乐艺术的优秀传统为基础，是以时代新人的审美标准为依据。但还要指出传统的音调、语言和素材并非民族化与群众化的唯一要素，同一素材却可产生多种不同风格的作品，因而音乐作品的民族化与群众化又必须是以音乐的旋律、组体、和声、节奏、形式结构等全部手段为依据的。《阿依古丽》音乐正是在这些方面还存在着一定的缺点，这即是：每当作者与群众的思想感情一致时，并讴心地力图以音乐形象来揭示这种感情时，其感人的力量是强大的；当作者的审美观点与群众一致时，并力图以音乐形象来验证这种观点时，其艺术光彩是新颖焕发的。反之，二者稍有游离，便在感情内容和艺术形式方面拉大了与人民群众的距离，从而削弱了作品的感情深度与思想力量。《阿依古丽》音乐词作、曲作与演唱等方面总的来说是成功的，但还有某些“欧化”痕迹。我们祝贺《阿依古丽》创作和演出的成功，同时希望它在演出过程中不断提高。（附图片）
