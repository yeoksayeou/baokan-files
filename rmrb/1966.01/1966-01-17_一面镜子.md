    A Mirror

    How significant is it to give prominence to politics? The experience of the 1205 Drilling Team of Daqing provides a very convincing answer.

    Any team has three states: advanced, intermediate, and backward. Leaders must be good at consciously selecting, cultivating, and establishing models from the advanced part, so that they can walk at the head of the team and lead the entire team forward.

    What should models look like? Daqing has models in various aspects. However, regardless of the aspect, the model should first and foremost be one that gives prominence to politics. Only politically sound models can be sound in production and other aspects. A politically sound model is a sample of someone who is good at creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and is a proletarian revolutionary. Only such a model can truly become a role model for people to learn from.

      “Class struggle is effective as soon as it is grasped, but it is not over as soon as it is grasped.” The process of establishing models is a process of giving prominence to politics, and in essence, it is also a process of class struggle. The process of growth and development of a model team is also full of struggle. To a large extent, this struggle is a reflection of class struggle in society. Some people think that once you become a model, you are politically "insured," everything is fine, and you don't need to be strictly required politically anymore. This statement itself is not giving prominence to politics. After winning a great victory for three years, the 1205 Drilling Team thought that the question of who would defeat whom had been resolved, that "doing a good job in production is the biggest politics," and that the remaining problem was only to "protect the red flag." They wanted to protect the red flag by "showing off" their skills in production. Did they protect it? They didn't protect it, and instead, they stumbled. The reason for the stumble was mainly that bourgeois ideology took advantage of the void and proletarian ideology was eroded. This is a lesson worth remembering forever.

      The statement that "doing a good job in production is the biggest politics" is wrong in itself, because this statement puts production before politics, and actually replaces politics with production, and cancels politics. And canceling politics inevitably opens the door to bourgeois ideology. The lesson of the 1205 Team is exactly like this. From this, it seems that the question is not whether to do a good job in production, but how to do a good job in production. The positive and negative experiences of the 1205 Team have shown that to do a good job in production, we can only take class struggle as the key link and give prominence to politics.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said that we must carry out constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggle and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts.

    Comrades engaged in production and construction should always remember Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and always take socialist revolutionary struggle and socialist education as the driving force for doing a good job in production.

    一面镜子
    突出政治到底有多么重大的意义？大庆一二○五钻井队的经历，提供了一个很有说服力的答案。
    任何一个队伍，都有先进、中间和落后的三种状态。领导者要善于从先进部分中，有意识地选择、培养和树立标兵，使他们走在队伍前头，带领整个队伍前进。
    标兵应当是什么样子的呢？大庆有各个方面的标兵。但是不管那个方面的标兵，都应当首先是突出政治的标兵。只有政治上过得硬的标兵，才能在生产及其它方面过得硬。政治上过硬的标兵，就是善于活学活用毛泽东思想的、无产阶级革命化的样板。只有这样的标兵，才能真正成为人们学习的榜样。
      “阶级斗争一抓就灵，但不是一抓就完。”树立标兵的过程，是突出政治的过程，实质上也就是阶级斗争的过程。标兵队成长和发展的过程，也充满着斗争。这种斗争，在很大的程度上是社会上阶级斗争的反映。有人以为，只要成了标兵，就在政治上“保了险”，就万事大吉了，就不必再从政治上严格要求了。这种说法的本身，就是没有突出政治。一二○五钻井队在打了三年大胜仗之后，以为谁战胜谁的问题已经解决，“搞好生产就是最大的政治”，剩下的问题只是“保红旗”了。他们想用生产上“露一手”的办法来保红旗。保住了没有呢？没有保住，反而跌了交子。跌交的原因，主要是资产阶级思想乘虚而入，无产阶级思想受了侵蚀。这是一个值得永远记取的教训。
      “搞好生产就是最大的政治”的说法本身就是错误的，因为这种说法把生产放到了政治的前面，实际上用生产代替了政治，取消了政治。而取消政治，也就必然给资产阶级思想打开大门。一二○五队的教训正是这样。由此看来，问题不在于要不要搞好生产，而在于怎样才能搞好生产。一二○五队正面的和反面的经验，都说明了，要搞好生产，只能以阶级斗争为纲，突出政治。
    毛泽东同志说过，必须在政治战线和思想战线上，进行经常的、艰苦的社会主义革命斗争和社会主义教育。
    我们从事生产建设的同志，应当永远记住毛泽东同志的教导，永远把社会主义革命斗争和社会主义教育作为搞好生产的动力。
