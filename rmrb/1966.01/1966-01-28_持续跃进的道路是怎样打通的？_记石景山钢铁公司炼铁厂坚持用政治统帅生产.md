    The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have successively reached three peaks in production levels over the past eight years.

    From 1958 to 1960, due to the commissioning of the No. 3 Blast Furnace, the No. 3 Coke Oven, and the Sintering Plant, and the efforts of all the plant's workers, pig iron production increased significantly, and major economic indicators rose to unprecedented levels.

    From 1961 to 1964, after adjustment, consolidation, filling out, and improvement, the average annual production of pig iron in the plant exceeded the average annual production from 1958 to 1960, and the main economic indicators of the blast furnaces exceeded the highest levels of that time.

    On the eve of the Third Five-Year Plan, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant also conquered the peak of the new technology of injecting pulverized coal into blast furnaces.

    How was the road of continuous leap forward and the climbing of three peaks over eight years by the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Ironmaking Plant opened up?

    A Class Struggle on the Ideological Front

    In the years of climbing the first peak, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant broke the foreign frameworks that had been followed in blast furnaces for more than half a century and carried out a revolution in ironmaking operations, increasing the number of times molten iron was poured out of the blast furnaces from eight to ten or twelve times per day and night.

    However, the revolution brought new tests.

    The rapid development of blast furnace production meant that raw materials and supplies could not keep up for a time, and the technical level and equipment conditions could not meet the needs of production development. Natural disasters in agriculture also brought unfavorable conditions to production. The Soviet revisionists' perfidious withdrawal of experts exacerbated these difficulties.

    Faced with this test, some people were confused by the difficulties. They did not approve of the revolution in ironmaking operations and brought out "foreign frameworks" again, advocating the restoration of the old methods and regulations that had been followed for more than half a century.

    The majority of the workers in the Ironmaking Plant adopted a correct attitude toward the difficulties. Some said: If we were like before liberation, only refining two "dumbbell-sized" pieces of iron a day, we wouldn't lack raw materials, but our country would still be poor and blank. Some said: Revolution is not embroidery; what's so scary about a few small problems? If we learn from experience, we can move forward better! If we all moved with measured steps like the old masters on the stage, there might not be any problems in production, but our country would fall behind and be bullied again by class enemies at home and abroad, which would be an even greater risk.

    This was a class struggle on the political and ideological front. The essence of this struggle was: revolution or "restoration"? Was it to sum up experience, overcome the shortcomings and difficulties on the road forward, and continue to advance holding high the red banner of the General Line, or was it to turn around and go backward?

    The Party Committee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the Party Committee of the Ironmaking Plant led this ideological struggle, carrying out education on the situation and class education among the masses. At the same time, they conducted systematic investigation and research work, correctly summed up experience, and drew conclusions based on facts.

    Let us look at the evolution of the "straight line" on the wind pressure gauge of the No. 2 Blast Furnace to see how the Ironmaking Plant dealt with this ideological struggle!

    Before 1958, this blast furnace produced more than 600 tons of iron per day. At this level, the wind pressure gauge pointer drew a slightly fluctuating straight line, indicating that the furnace was running smoothly (normally). Starting in 1958, the output of this blast furnace increased significantly. However, the straight line on the wind pressure gauge occasionally showed sawtooth-like small "peaks," which were signals that the blast furnace was not running smoothly. In this way, some people missed the straight line of the past. But many workers did not cherish that kind of smooth operation, because it was achieved under conditions of low production. They believed that it was wrong not to pay attention to the smooth operation of the blast furnace; without smooth operation, production could not be stable. However, it should be smooth operation under high production, and stability under high production. To yearn for smooth operation under low production was ideologically "going against the tide," it was "restoration," and it was forgetting the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    After ideological struggle, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant unified their understanding, summed up their experience, overcame their shortcomings, and adopted measures, and the blast furnace changed from not running smoothly to running smoothly again. Now the daily output of this blast furnace has increased by 40% compared with before 1958. And the fluctuating curve that once appeared on the wind pressure gauge has also become a new straight line on this basis of high production.

    Attack or Defend?

    Through this ideological struggle, people also saw the truth and spoke the truth about the problem of equipment conditions not being able to adapt to the development of production. Some said: There is nothing to be alarmed about when our equipment has some problems. The No. 1 Blast Furnace is an old "Western product" from the 1920s; the No. 2 Blast Furnace is a dilapidated "Eastern product" that was dismantled and moved more than 20 years ago. These equipments are not here to help us develop greatly. Some said that the newly built No. 3 Blast Furnace was copied from old foreign models. Foreign design standards are based on old experience, and of course our equipment can't keep up if we break that set. People paid more attention to finding reasons from the subjective side. They said that in the past, repairing furnaces was just copying blindly, patching and mending, only "defending" and not "attacking," and that doing so would not keep up with the needs of rapid production development, no matter how many times they were repaired.

    Therefore, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant transformed the blast furnaces according to the path they had created, giving them new vitality.

    The dilapidated "Eastern product" No. 2 Blast Furnace had its charging, iron tapping, and hot air equipment modified. The old "Western product" No. 1 Blast Furnace was also completely modified. For one or two hundred years, blast furnaces had always been developing toward being tall and large. Now, the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Ironmaking Plant has been transformed into a larger "short and fat" blast furnace, becoming a pioneer in exploring the reform of modern blast furnace profiles.

    The No. 3 Blast Furnace, which was designed according to old foreign models, was also modified. The 20-ton heavy charging bell on the top of the furnace could only be used for a little over a year in the past. In 1963, the Ironmaking Plant and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Repair Plant jointly adopted new technologies to strengthen the charging bell. Since then, more than one million tons of ore and coke have been smashed onto it every year, but it is still in good condition after two and a half years.

    The equipment of the Ironmaking Plant has now been completely changed. The production level of the plant is higher than before, but their equipment situation is better, and the equipment integrity rate is maintained at 94%. Before and after 1957, the blast furnaces in the plant were repaired every three months, but now they are repaired every eleven months.

    Active Balance or Passive Balance?

    The transformed blast furnaces have a large appetite, strong digestion, and eat a lot of materials. In this way, the contradiction of insufficient raw materials was prominently exposed.

    There are two different views and attitudes in recognizing and handling this problem. One view is that the pace of blast furnace innovation is too fast, and it advocates that the fast should look to the slow, that is, it wants a passive balance. Another view is that the shortage of raw materials is a new contradiction brought about by the great development of production. The way to solve this problem is not to blame the blast furnace for being too fast, but to actively create conditions to make the raw materials keep up, and the slow should look to the fast. They advocate opening up new sources and reducing expenditures, actively balancing, and promoting the great development of production.

    People in the Ironmaking Plant adopted an active balance attitude, and the ways to expand the source of ore and coke were found.

    High-sulfur ore powder was always regarded as a big "hedgehog" by ironmaking people, which was not easy to deal with. It contains too much sulfur, and ironmaking is easy to produce waste products; however, its iron content is very high, reaching more than 50%. The Ironmaking Plant and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Sintering Plant and other relevant units decided to pull out all the thorns of this "hedgehog." They united and, after one experiment after another, found a set of desulfurization sintering methods, turning high-sulfur iron ore into a valuable resource for ironmaking. Since 1963, the utilization of high-sulfur iron has increased several times compared with the past. This not only saves a lot of coke (ore with less iron or more sulfur costs coke), but also increases pig iron production. The Ironmaking Plant also cooperated with the raw material department to produce 300,000 tons of pig iron using the ore and ore powder with less iron content and mixed composition left over from the past few years. During this period, the output of ore also gradually increased.

    In the past, according to general regulations at home and abroad, coke pieces smaller than duck eggs were not loaded into large blast furnaces, fearing that they would affect operation, and they were all screened out and treated as "scraps." From 1961, in order to save coke, the Ironmaking Plant changed the sieve mesh from the size of a duck egg to the size of a chicken egg. That's not all, they screened the crushed coke again and selected coke pieces the size of pigeon eggs for medium-sized blast furnaces to eat. Using this method, they recovered more than 120,000 tons of small coke pieces from scraps in five years, producing more than 180,000 tons of pig iron.

    People in the Ironmaking Plant adhered to the spirit of the General Line under difficult conditions, transformed the equipment, expanded the source of raw materials, climbed the second peak, and made greater progress in product variety, quality, and output.

    Living the Days Guarding the Achievements or Continuous Revolution?

    After climbing two peaks in succession, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant faced another struggle: should they guard the booth and live a comfortable life, or should they continue to revolutionize?

    Such a great thing as the great development of production in the plant caused two completely different reactions among the workers. Many people were encouraged by the new achievements, stood on the already climbed peak and saw farther, and they put forward a new slogan: "Catch up with and surpass advanced levels at home and abroad!" Some other people only lingered their eyes on four indicators that had caught up with advanced levels in China, although other indicators were still behind others, but they believed that it was because their conditions were not as good as others. They said: "If the conditions are changed, who knows who the champion will be!" Due to lack of ambition, when the Party Committee of the factory was studying the slogan of "Catching up with the advanced and surpassing the advanced," they erased the word "surpassing" and only left "Catching up with the advanced."

    The retention or removal of this one word "surpassing" is essentially a question of whether or not to continue to hold high the red banner of the General Line after making great achievements. Only catching up with the advanced and not daring to surpass the advanced, although also advancing, is always following behind others. This is actually putting oneself in the middle reaches, and in the end, one cannot but become the downstream, the backward.

    At this time, the Party Committee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company used Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People" as weapons, one copy for each worker. The workers, according to Chairman Mao's works, hotly discussed a fundamental question: for whom is iron made?

    Chairman Mao's works stimulated people's revolutionary consciousness. Many workers, through conscious revolution, criticized the ideological remnants of making iron to earn money to support their families, criticized the ideological remnants of making iron for fame, criticized the ideological remnants of making iron for indicators..., and the idea of "making iron for the revolution" was more clearly established.

    When people looked at achievements with the worldview of "making iron for the revolution," they realized that the achievements that had already been made were not large enough or high enough compared with the needs of the world's revolutionary cause. Seeing achievements as the peak, carrying them on one's back, would become a burden and stagnate; using achievements as stepping stones, climbing on them, would reach even higher peaks and win even greater victories.

    At this time, a socialist education movement was launched in the factory; at the same time, the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people was studied, which greatly improved the class consciousness of the workers.

    At this time, the members of the Party Committee of the factory repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotation that "the history of mankind is a history of continuous development from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom," and studied the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on catching up with and surpassing advanced levels at home and abroad. The word "surpassing" that had once been erased by the Party Committee was again highly established in the Party Committee's guiding ideology, and they were determined to lead the team to create a new level in production.

    Following in the Footsteps of Others or Catching up and Surpassing?

    However, the shortage of coke blocked the way for the Ironmaking Plant to develop production. At that time, the production situation of the Ironmaking Plant was "iron determined by coke." If the coke barrier was not broken through, the Ironmaking Plant's game of developing production would not come alive. Is there anything else to replace coke for ironmaking? In the past, blast furnaces have always used coke as fuel. Some foreign experts have called coke the "master of blast furnaces." And in their view, this seems to have become an immutable law.

    The workers who established the idea of "making iron for the revolution," in order to solve the problem of insufficient coke supply, decided to attack a new technology that some industrially advanced countries had explored for many years but had not officially used in production—injecting pulverized coal into blast furnaces—and create a new way for the development of ironmaking production in our country.

    In the experiment of this new technology, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant also encountered the many difficulties encountered by some pioneers. But "not afraid of water when crossing a big river, not afraid of ghosts when walking at night," how can you be afraid of danger when climbing a peak!

    They carried out tense and arduous scientific experiments with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and a high degree of scientific spirit. In the experiment, the pulverized coal tank spontaneously combusted and exploded twice in a row, almost causing personal accidents. At this time, discussions about pulverized coal injection being a "time bomb" and a "powder magazine" continued to come. A foreign expert who came to Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, when talking about their country's research on pulverized coal injection, shrugged his shoulders, spread his hands, and made a gesture: "Explosion!" Another foreign expert, when talking about their experiment with this new technology, also shook his head repeatedly and said: "Nodules!" Some people also wavered. They believed that since foreigners had messed up, could we still succeed? People armed with Mao Zedong Thought opposed this "lackey thought." They said: Can't we do what foreigners can't do? We are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, how can we be afraid of "ghosts"? We must break through this barrier and be the first generation of blast furnace coal injection workers.

    In order to subdue it, we must first understand it. In order to understand the law of pulverized coal explosion, the scientific research and design personnel participating in the experiment visited relevant departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and other places and conducted a large number of investigations and studies. The laboratories of some units also provided a lot of scientific data for experimenting with the explosion performance of various types of coal and various particle sizes at different temperatures. After hundreds of repeated experiments, people finally studied the law of pulverized coal explosion. According to this law, defenses were set up at every level, and every place was controlled, and the risk of explosion was finally overcome. Pulverized coal was successfully and continuously injected into the No. 1 Blast Furnace, and the pulverized coal injection volume reached 30% of the total fuel entering the furnace, and climbed to the peak of coal injection technology in one fell swoop.

    For nearly a hundred years, the superstition that modern blast furnaces cannot be mixed with ordinary coal for ironmaking has been broken. Blast furnaces can be mixed with the coal that people use for cooking.

    An important indicator of the technical level of blast furnaces—coke consumption per ton of pig iron—has been reduced from more than 500 kilograms to about 400 kilograms, leaping into the world's advanced ranks. At the same time, the cost of pig iron has been reduced by 2.65%. The pass rate of pig iron remains 100%. Due to the coke saved by pulverized coal injection in the No. 1 Blast Furnace, the production situation of "iron determined by coke" in the entire plant has been initially changed, and the current daily output of pig iron has increased by 7.5% compared with before.

    A new path for my country's ironmaking industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has been opened up here. ×××

    At this moment when the Third Five-Year Plan is beginning to be implemented, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant review the road they have traveled: How was the road of continuous leap forward opened up over the past eight years? It was opened up with Mao Zedong Thought, and it was opened up by holding high the red banner of the General Line.

    They also saw that, compared with the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people, their gap in the areas of leadership revolutionization, team revolutionization, and management revolutionization is still very large. They also saw that, compared with advanced levels at home and abroad in production, some indicators have not yet reached the most advanced levels, and there are still backward areas. They also realized that their achievements already contain the hard work of comrades from many relevant units inside and outside the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company.

    They are determined to hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, hold the great red banner of the General Line high, and continue to climb the peak of modern world smelting technology.

    持续跃进的道路是怎样打通的？
    ——记石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂坚持用政治统帅生产
    石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂职工高举毛泽东思想红旗，八年来生产水平接连登上了三个高峰。
    一九五八年到一九六○年，由于第三高炉、第三焦炉和烧结厂投入生产和全厂职工的努力，生铁产量大幅度增长，主要经济指标提高到前所未有的水平。
    一九六一年到一九六四年，经过调整、巩固、充实、提高，全厂生铁平均年产量超过了一九五八年到一九六○年的平均年产量，高炉的主要经济指标都超过了那时的最高水平。
    第三个五年计划的前夕，炼铁厂职工又攻占了向高炉里喷吹煤粉这个新技术的高峰。
    石钢炼铁厂职工八年持续跃进、连登三个高峰的道路是怎样打通的呢？
    一场思想战线上的阶级斗争
    在攀登第一个高峰的年代里，炼铁厂职工打破了高炉上沿袭半个多世纪的洋框框，进行了一场炼铁操作的革命，使高炉每昼夜倾泻出的铁水由八次增加到了十次、十二次。
    可是，革命带来了新的考验。
    高炉生产的飞速发展，原料、材料一时跟不上去，技术水平、设备条件，适应不了生产发展的需要。农业上的自然灾害，也给生产带来了不利条件。修正主义背信弃义撤退专家，又加重了这些困难。
    在这个考验面前，有人被困难弄迷糊了。他们不赞成炼铁操作的革命，又搬出“洋框框”来，主张恢复曾经沿袭半个多世纪的那一套旧法陈规。
    炼铁厂多数职工，对困难采取了正确的态度。有的说：象解放前那样，每天只炼“秤砣大”的两块铁，那倒不缺原料，可咱国家还是落个一穷二白。有的说：搞革命又不是绣花，出点小乱子，有什么可怕的？吸取了经验，就能更好地前进！都象舞台上员外老爷那样迈着四方步，生产上可能不出乱子，可咱国家就会落后，就会重新受国内外阶级敌人的欺侮，这就要冒更大的风险。
    这是一场在政治思想战线上的阶级斗争。这场斗争的实质是一个：是革命，还是“复古”？是总结经验，克服前进道路上的缺点和困难，高举总路线的红旗继续前进，还是向后转，走回头路？
    石钢党委和炼铁厂党委领导了这场思想斗争，在群众中进行了形势教育和阶级教育。同时作了系统的调查研究工作，正确地总结了经验，并且用事实作了结论。
    让我们从二号高炉风压表上的“一条直线”的演变，来看炼铁厂如何对待这场思想斗争吧！
    一九五八年以前，这座高炉每天出六百多吨铁。在这个水平上，风压表指针下划出的是微微波动的一条直线，表示炉子顺行（正常）。一九五八年开始，这座高炉产量有很大提高。可是，风压表上的那条直线，不时出现了锯齿似的小“山峰”，那是高炉不大顺行的信号。这样，有人怀念起以前的那条直线来。但是许多职工并不稀罕那种顺行，因为那是在低产条件下取得的。他们认为不重视高炉顺行是不对的，不顺行，生产就不能稳定。但是，应该是高产的顺行，高产的稳定。向往低产下的顺行，那在思想上便是“逆行”，便是“复古”，便是忘掉了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线精神。
    炼铁厂职工们经过思想斗争，统一了认识，总结了经验，克服了缺点，采取了措施，高炉又由不大顺行转化为顺行。现在这座高炉每天的产量比一九五八年前增加了百分之四十。而风压表上曾经出现的那条忽起忽伏的曲线，也在这高产基础上变成了一条新的直线。
    攻还是守
    经过这场思想上的斗争，人们对设备条件适应不了生产发展的问题，也看清楚了真相，说出了真理。有的说：咱们那号设备出些毛病，没有什么可以大惊小怪的。一高炉是二十年代的陈旧的“西洋货”；二高炉是二十多年前拆迁来的破烂的“东洋货”。这些设备可不是来给咱闹大发展的。有的说，新建的三高炉，是照国外的老模子刻出来的。国外的设计标准是按老经验规定的，咱们破了它那一套，设备当然跟不上趟了。人们更重视从主观上找原因。他们说：过去修炉子，只是照葫芦画瓢，缝缝补补，只“守”不“攻”，那样干，修多少次也跟不上生产迅速发展的需要。
    炼铁厂的职工于是按着自己闯出的路子改造高炉，使它们获得新的生命力。
    那座破烂的“东洋货”二高炉，装料、出铁和热风设备改了。那座陈旧的“西洋货”一高炉，也全部改了。一二百年以来，高炉一直是向高大发展的。如今，石钢炼铁厂一高炉已经改成较大的“矮胖子”高炉，成了探索改革现代化高炉炉型的先行者。
    那座按国外老模子设计的三高炉，也改了。炉顶上二十吨重的大料钟，过去只能用一年多。一九六三年，炼铁厂和石钢修理厂一起，采用新技术，强化了大料钟。从那时起，每年要有一百多万吨矿石和焦炭砸落在它身上，可是，至今两年半了，它还很完好。
    炼铁厂的设备现在已经完全改观。全厂的生产水平比以前更高了，可是，他们的设备情况更好了，设备完好率保持在百分之九十四。一九五七年前后，全厂的高炉每三个月修一次，现在是十一个月修一次。
    积极平衡还是消极平衡
    改造后的高炉，胃口大，消化力强，吃料多。这样，原料不足的矛盾又突出地暴露出来了。
    认识和处理这个问题，有两种不同的观点和态度。一种观点认为，高炉革新的步伐太快了，主张快的向慢的看齐，也就是说要那个消极平衡。另一种观点认为，原料不足，是生产大发展带来的新矛盾。解决这个问题的办法，不是怪高炉的步伐太快了，而是应该积极创造条件，使原料跟上来，慢的向快的看齐。他们主张开源节流，积极平衡，促进生产的大发展。
    炼铁厂的人们采取积极平衡的态度，扩大矿石和焦炭来源的门路也就找到了。
    高硫矿粉，过去一直被炼铁的人看作是个大“刺猬”，不好下嘴。它含硫过高，炼铁容易出废品；可是它的含铁量又很多，达到百分之五十以上。炼铁厂和石钢烧结厂等有关单位的人员，决心把这个“刺猬”的刺全部拔光。他们联合起来，经过一次又一次的试验，找到了一套脱硫的烧结方法，使高硫铁矿变成炼铁的宝贵资源。从一九六三年起，每年利用的高硫铁比以前提高了几倍。这样既节省了大量焦炭（矿石含铁少或含硫多都费焦炭），又增加了生铁产量。炼铁厂还和原料部门协作，用过去几年剩下的含铁少成分杂的矿石、矿粉，生产了三十万吨生铁。在这期间，矿石的产量也逐步增加了。
    过去，按国内外一般规定，不把小于鸭蛋大的焦块装入大型高炉，怕影响操作，都把它筛出来当“下脚料”处理。从一九六一年起，炼铁厂为节省焦炭，就把筛子眼由鸭蛋那么大改成鸡蛋那么大。这还不算，他们把筛下的碎焦再过一道筛，把鸽子蛋大小的焦丁选出来，给中型的高炉吃。他们用这种办法，五年期间从下脚料里回收了十二万多吨小焦块，多生产了十八万吨生铁。
    炼铁厂的人们在困难的条件下坚持总路线的精神，改造了设备，扩大了原料的来源，攀登上第二个高峰，产品品种、质量和产量等等都有了更大的进步。
    守着成绩过日子还是不断革命
    炼铁厂职工在连攀两个高峰以后又面临另一场斗争：是守摊过舒服日子，还是不断革命？
    全厂生产大发展这样一件大好事，在职工中引起了两种完全不同的反应。许多人为新的成就所鼓舞，站在已经登上的高峰看得更远了，他们提出一个新的口号：“赶上和超过国内外先进水平！”另外一些人眼光只留恋在四个赶上国内先进水平的指标上，虽然其它指标还落在人家后面，但是他们认为那是条件不如人家。他们说：“把条件换过来，说不定谁是冠军呢！”由于缺乏雄心壮志，工厂党委会在研究“赶先进、超先进”这个口号时，把个“超”字给抹掉了，只留下了“赶先进”。
    这一个“超”字的去留，实质上是在取得巨大成就后还要不要继续高举总路线红旗的问题。只是赶先进，不敢超先进，虽然也在前进，但总是跟在别人后面走。这实际上是使自己处于中游的地位，最后不能不沦为下游的地位、落后的地位。
    这时候，石钢党委把毛主席的《为人民服务》等文章当作武器，人手一册，发到每个职工手里。职工们对照毛主席著作，热烈地议论着一个根本性的大问题：为谁炼铁？
    毛主席的著作激发了人们革命的自觉性。不少职工通过自觉革命，批判了为挣钱养家而炼铁的思想残余，批判了为名誉而炼铁的思想残余，批判了为指标而炼铁的思想残余……，一个“为革命而炼铁”的思想更加鲜明地树立起来了。
    用“为革命而炼铁”的世界观来看待成绩时，人们觉察到，已经取得的成绩同世界革命事业的需要比起来，再大也不算大，再高也不算高。把成绩看作顶点，背着它，就会成为包袱，停滞不前；把成绩当作阶梯，登着它，就会登上更高的高峰，夺取更大的胜利。
    这时候，工厂里开展了社会主义教育运动；同时，学习了大庆人的革命精神，使职工的阶级觉悟大大提高。
    这时候，工厂党委成员反复学习了毛主席关于“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史”的语录，学习了中共北京市委关于赶超国内外先进水平的指示，一度被党委抹掉的那个超字，就又在党委的指导思想里高高地树立了起来，他们决心带领队伍在生产上打出一个新的水平。踩着别人脚印走还是赶上超过去
    但是，焦炭不足挡住了炼铁厂发展生产的去路。当时，炼铁厂的生产局面是“以焦定铁”。焦这一关突不破，炼铁厂发展生产的这盘棋就活不起来。有没有别的东西代替焦炭炼铁呢？过去，高炉一直是用焦炭做燃料。国外有些专家把焦炭说成是“高炉的主人”。而且在他们看来，这似乎成了一成不变的定律。
    树立了“为革命炼铁”思想的职工们，为了解决焦炭供应不足的问题，决心把一些工业先进国家探索了多年而没有正式用于生产的一项新技术——向高炉里喷吹煤粉，攻下来，为我国炼铁生产的发展闯出一条新的路子。
    炼铁厂职工在这项新技术的试验中，也遇到了一些先行者所遇到的重重难关。但是“过大河不怕水，走夜路不怕鬼”，攀登高峰哪能怕险！
    他们用高度的革命干劲和高度的科学精神，进行了紧张而艰苦的科学试验。在试验中，煤粉罐连续两次发生自燃和小爆炸，险些造成人身事故。这时，喷吹煤粉是“定时炸弹”、是“火药库”的议论，不断传来。一位来石钢的外国专家，谈到他们国家研究喷煤粉时，两肩一耸，双手一摊，做了一个姿势：“爆炸！”又一个外国专家谈到他们试验这项新技术时，也连连摇头说：“结瘤！”有些人也动摇起来了。他们认为，外国人都捅了漏子，咱们还搞得成？用毛泽东思想武装起来的人们反对了这种“贾桂思想”，他们说：外国人办不到的事难道我们就不能办到？我们不怕苦，不怕死，岂能怕“鬼”？我们一定要闯过这一关，当第一代高炉喷煤工人。
    为了制服它，先要认识它。为了认识煤粉爆炸的规律，参加试验的科学研究和设计人员，访问了北京、上海、杭州、南京等地有关部门，进行了大量的调查研究。有的单位的试验室里，也在为这里试验各种煤种、各种粒度在不同温度下的爆炸性能，提供了大量科学数据。经过成百次地反复试验，人们终于研究出煤粉爆炸的规律。根据这个规律，层层设防，处处把关，终于战胜了爆炸的风险，在一高炉上成功地向高炉里连续喷吹了煤粉，煤粉喷吹量达到了入炉燃料总量百分之三十的水平，一举攀上了喷煤技术的高峰。
    近百年以来，现代高炉不能掺用普通煤炼铁的迷信被打破了，高炉可以掺用人们烧火做饭的煤炼铁了。
    标志高炉技术水平的一个重要指标——每吨生铁消耗的焦炭，由五百多公斤减少到了四百公斤左右，一跃而进入世界先进行列。同时，生铁成本减少了百分之二点六五。生铁合格率仍然保持百分之百。由于一高炉喷吹煤粉节省出的焦炭，全厂“以焦定铁”的生产局面已经初步改变，目前生铁日产量已比以前提高百分之七点五。
    我国炼铁工业的一条多快好省的新路在这里开拓出来了。×××
    在这开始执行第三个五年计划的时刻，炼铁厂职工回顾他们走过的道路：八年持续跃进的道路是怎样打通的呢？是用毛泽东思想打通的，是高举总路线红旗闯开的。
    他们也看到，同大庆人的革命精神对照，自己在领导革命化、队伍革命化、管理革命化等方面的差距还很大。他们也看到，在生产上同国内外的先进水平相比，有些指标还没有达到最先进的水平，还有落后的地方。他们也认识到，他们已经取得的成就，包含着石钢内外许多有关单位同志们的辛勤劳动。
    他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举总路线伟大红旗，继续攀登现代世界冶炼技术的高峰。
