    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 18th. According to Radio Pathet Lao, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 17th, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialist plot to directly send troops to occupy the liberated areas of Central and Lower Laos. The statement pointed out that this is part of the U.S. imperialist plot to expand its aggression in Indochina in order to salvage its defeat in South Vietnam.
    The statement reiterated the Lao people's ironclad determination to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation to the end, and their resolve to fight alongside the fraternal Vietnamese and Cambodian people against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.
    The statement said: Since U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler went to the South Vietnamese battlefield at the end of November 1965 to "inspect," the Washington authorities have repeatedly and publicly stated that the United States would intensify the bombing of the liberated areas of Laos and send U.S. troops to directly occupy the Central and Lower Laos regions. On December 21, 1965, a U.S. State Department spokesman officially declared that U.S. troops in South Vietnam have the right, at any time, to attack and invade Lao and Cambodian territory under the fabricated pretext of "self-defense" and "pursuit of the Viet Cong."
    The statement said: Kouprasith-Sananikone reactionary clique, the puppet head in Vientiane of the United States, is echoing their master, wantonly slandering the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to pave the way for U.S. troops to enter Laos.
    The statement said that in recent months, the United States has intensified its use of air power to bomb and strafe the liberated areas of Laos, especially in the Central and Lower Laos regions, with unprecedented frenzy, while intensifying the spreading of chemical poisons to kill people, livestock, and destroy crops.
    The statement said: Since the beginning of the dry season, dozens of battalions of the Lao right-wing regular army have been assembled in the provinces of Khammouane and Savannakhet and have launched many attacks on the liberated areas. An increasing number of Thai troops are sneaking into Laos. On Thai territory, especially in northeastern Thailand near Central and Lower Laos, the United States and the Bangkok regime are stepping up preparations for logistical bases and deploying forces. Secret meetings between the puppet regimes and puppet military leaders in Vientiane and Saigon are also very frequent.
    The statement said that these activities are part of the U.S. plot to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Laos, in order to send U.S. troops to directly occupy the Central and Lower Laos regions and turn this area into a strategic bridgehead connecting South Vietnam and Thailand, in order to permanently divide Laos, oppose the Vietnamese people, and undermine the independence and neutrality of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
    The statement pointed out that the current U.S. imperialist plot to send U.S. troops to occupy the Central and Lower Laos regions, as well as their frantic increase in troops, intensified aggression against South Vietnam, and preparation to use its air force and navy to "escalate" its destructive war against North Vietnam even more fiercely, and to intensify attacks, provocations, and threats against the Kingdom of Cambodia. These actions are all part of the U.S. imperialist plot to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula in order to salvage their defeat in South Vietnam.
    The statement pointed out that this plot of U.S. imperialism has created an extremely serious new crisis, threatening the complete tearing up of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question, the various agreements signed between the three political forces of Laos, and the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Indochina question. The entire Laos and the entire Indochina Peninsula are in danger of being turned into a vast battlefield with intense fighting.
    The statement said that the "peace offensive" launched by the U.S. Johnson administration on the Vietnam issue at this time is essentially a smokescreen to cover up its extremely sinister plot. The Lao people fully sympathize with and support the statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 4, 1966, and the statement of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on January 5, 1966. The Lao people believe that if the Johnson administration truly desires peace, it must withdraw the United States and its servant troops and military personnel from South Vietnam and Laos, abandon the conspiracy and actions of aggression against Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia in any form, and let the Indochinese people solve the internal affairs of Indochina themselves.
    The statement said that the U.S. imperialist attempt to use the "peace talks" trick to "deceive the people of the world" will inevitably meet with a more ignominious failure.
    The statement said that the Lao people once again reiterate their ironclad determination to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation to the end. The Lao people cherish peace very much, but will never lose national independence and sovereignty for the sake of empty "peace." The Lao people are determined to fight side by side with the fraternal Vietnamese and Cambodian people against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism. The Lao people will, when necessary, call on friends from all five continents and peace-loving people to provide practical support in spirit and material. The Lao people are determined to make Laos a graveyard for the American aggressors and make a practical contribution to the defense of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.
    The statement expressed the hope that the King of Laos will take effective measures for the survival and security of the motherland and contribute to stopping the conspiracy of the American aggressors.
    The statement called on the people of all nationalities and strata of Laos to launch a struggle together with patriotic organizations to stop the huge disaster brought to the nation by U.S. imperialism and its lackey groups.
    The statement called on Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Boun Oum to return to the negotiating table with Prince Souphanouvong as soon as possible for the lofty interests of the motherland, and to jointly seek ways to save the country from the huge disaster brought about by the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its faithful lackey groups on the basis of mutual understanding and understanding.
    The statement called on the governments and peoples of all countries that have consistently and thoroughly respected and strictly fulfilled the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peace-loving people of the world, including the American people, to take effective measures as soon as possible in order to maintain the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question, and for the security of Laos, Indochina, and Southeast Asia, to stop the dangerous new war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

### 老挝爱国战线党中央发表声明  强烈抗议美帝阴谋派兵侵占中下寮  重申老挝人民决心同越柬人民一起粉碎美帝扩大战争阴谋

    老挝爱国战线党中央发表声明
    强烈抗议美帝阴谋派兵侵占中下寮
    重申老挝人民决心同越柬人民一起粉碎美帝扩大战争阴谋
    新华社康开十八日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十七日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义阴谋直接派兵侵占中寮和下寮解放区。声明指出，这是美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方的失败而扩大侵略印度支那的阴谋的一部分。
    声明重申老挝人民抗美救国到底的钢铁决心，并且决心同兄弟的越南人民和柬埔寨人民并肩战斗，反对共同的敌人美帝国主义。
    声明说：一九六五年十一月底美国国防部长麦克纳马拉和参谋长联席会议主席惠勒到越南南方战场“视察”以来，华盛顿当局一再公开表示美国要加紧轰炸老挝解放区和派遣美军直接占领中寮和下寮地区。一九六五年十二月二十一日美国国务院发言人正式宣称在南越的美军不论任何时候都有权以它捏造的“自卫”和“追击越共”的理由，袭击和侵犯老挝和柬埔寨领土。
    声明说：美国在万象的走狗头目库帕拉西—萨纳尼空反动集团为了附和它们的主子，正在大肆诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国，为美军进入老挝开辟道路。
    声明说，最近几个月以来，美国加紧用空军空前疯狂地轰炸、扫射老挝解放区各地，特别是在中寮、下寮地区，同时加紧撒放化学毒药，杀害人民、家畜和破坏庄稼。
    声明说：从旱季开始以来，老挝右派正规军中数以十计的营已经在甘蒙和沙湾拿吉两省集结，并多次对解放区发动进攻。泰国军队日益众多地偷偷进入老挝。在泰国领土上，特别是在接近中寮和下寮地区的泰国东北部，美国和曼谷政权正在加紧准备后勤基地和布置力量。万象和西贡伪政权和伪军头目们的秘密会晤也十分频繁。
    声明说，这些活动是美国强化和扩大侵略老挝战争阴谋的一部分，是为了派遣美国军队直接侵占中寮和下寮地区，并把这一地区变成连接南越和泰国之间的战略桥头堡，以便长期分割老挝、反对越南人民、破坏柬埔寨王国的独立和中立。
    声明指出，目前美帝国主义阴谋派遣美国军队侵占中寮和下寮地区以及它们疯狂增兵，加紧进行对越南南方的侵略战争，准备使用它的空军和海军来使它对越南北方进行的破坏性战争更激烈地“升级”，并且对柬埔寨王国加紧进攻、挑衅和威胁。这些行动都是美帝国主义企图把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那半岛，以挽救它们在越南南方的败局的阴谋中的一部分。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这一阴谋造成了极其严重的新危机，使一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议、老挝三种政治力量之间签订的各项协议和一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议，有被完全撕毁的危机。整个老挝和整个印度支那半岛有被变成战斗剧烈的大片战场的危机。
    声明说，美国约翰逊政权在这个时候在越南问题上开展的“和平攻势”，实质上是用来掩盖它的十分恶毒的阴谋的烟幕。老挝人民完全同情和支持越南民主共和国外交部发言人一九六六年一月四日的声明和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六六年一月五日的声明。老挝人民认为，如果约翰逊政权真正希望和平，就必须把美国及其仆从军队和军事人员从越南南方和老挝撤走，放弃以任何形式对老挝、越南和柬埔寨进行侵略的阴谋和行动，让印度支那人民自己解决印度支那的内部事务。
    声明说，美帝国主义妄图用“和谈”骗局来“遮盖天下人耳目”的阴谋，必将遭到更加可耻的失败。
    声明说，老挝人民再次重申自己抗美救国到底的钢铁决心，老挝人民非常热爱和平，但是决不为空洞的“和平”而失去民族的独立和主权。老挝人民决心同兄弟的越南人民和柬埔寨人民为反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义，并肩战斗。老挝人民在必要的时候将呼吁五大洲的朋友和爱好和平人民在精神和物资方面给予切实支持。老挝人民决心使老挝成为埋葬美国侵略者的坟地，对保卫印度支那和东南亚的和平作出切实的贡献。
    声明表示希望老挝国王为了祖国的生存和安全采取有效的措施，为制止美国侵略者的阴谋作出贡献。
    声明呼吁老挝全国各民族各阶层人民，同爱国的组织一起展开斗争，制止美帝国主义和它的走狗集团给民族带来的巨大灾难。
    声明呼吁富马亲王和文翁亲王为了祖国的崇高利益，尽快同苏发努冯亲王回到谈判桌上，在互相谅解和了解的基础上，共同寻求挽救国家免于遭到由美帝国主义和它的忠实走狗集团的阴谋带来的巨大灾难。
    声明呼吁过去一贯彻底尊重和严正履行一九六二年关于老挝问题日内瓦协议的有关各国政府和人民，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，以及世界爱好和平人民，包括美国人民在内，为了维护一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，为了老挝、印度支那和东南亚的安全，尽快采取有效措施来制止美帝国主义的危险的新战争阴谋。
