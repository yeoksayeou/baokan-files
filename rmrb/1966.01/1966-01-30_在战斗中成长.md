　　Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that learning warfare through warfare is the primary method of revolutionary people. He said, "Revolutionary war is a matter for the masses. It is often not a matter of learning it well before doing it, but rather learning while doing it; doing is learning." It was in the great school of revolutionary war that the Chinese people learned to fight, underwent training, strengthened their forces, and finally achieved the great victory of the revolution. The revolutionary people of many other countries have also followed this path. The patriotic people of Congo (L) are undergoing the same path.
　　The people of Congo (L) do not want to fight; it is U.S. imperialism that has forced them to take up arms to fight for their survival, independence, and liberation. The people of Congo (L) did not originally know how to fight; it is U.S. imperialism that has gradually taught them. In the past year or so of armed struggle, the patriotic people of Congo (L) have achieved many victories and suffered some setbacks; they have accumulated experience and paid sacrifices. In this process, they have not only greatly raised their political consciousness but also gradually become familiar with the strategies and tactics of people's war, constantly growing in battle. This is precisely the law of development for all revolutionary forces from small to large and from weak to strong.
　　The leaders of the patriotic armed forces of Congo (L) held a meeting in the Ruzizi River Valley, summarized past experiences, studied the current situation, and were full of confidence in their own strength. The people's war in Congo (L) will surely be further expanded and strengthened. Although the people of Congo (L) may encounter various difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead, the general trend that people's war will surely triumph is something that no force can change. The development and victory of the armed struggle of the people of Congo (L) will once again prove the truth that "a single spark can start a prairie fire."

    在战斗中成长
    毛泽东同志曾经指出，从战争学习战争，是革命人民的主要方法。他说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”中国人民就是在革命战争这所伟大的学校中学会了打仗，经受了锻炼，壮大了力量，最后取得了革命的伟大胜利的。其他许多国家的革命人民也是这样走过来的。刚果（利）的爱国人民正在经历着同样的道路。
    刚果（利）人民并不想打仗，是美帝国主义迫使他们拿起武器为了自己的生存、独立和解放而斗争。刚果（利）人民本来并不会打仗，是美帝国主义逐渐教会了他们。刚果（利）的爱国人民在过去一年多的武装斗争中，取得了许多胜利，也受到了一些挫折，他们积累了经验，也付出了牺牲。在这个过程中，他们不但大大提高了政治觉悟，而且逐渐熟悉了人民战争的战略战术，在战斗中不断成长。这正是一切革命力量从小到大，从弱到强的发展规律。
    刚果（利）爱国武装领导人在鲁齐齐河谷举行的会议，总结了过去的经验，研究了当前的形势，对于自己的力量充满了信心。刚果
  （利）的人民战争必将会更加扩大和加强。尽管刚果（利）人民在前进的道路上，还可能遇到这样那样的困难和障碍，但是人民战争一定胜利的总趋势，是任何力量也改变不了的。刚果（利）人民武装斗争的发展和胜利，将再一次证明“星星之火，可以燎原”这一真理。
