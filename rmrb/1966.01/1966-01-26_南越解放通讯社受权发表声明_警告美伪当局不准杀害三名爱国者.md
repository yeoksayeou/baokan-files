    South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency Authorized to Issue Statement
    Warning to the U.S.-Puppet Authorities Not to Murder Three Patriots
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 24th, the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency was authorized to issue a statement, sternly warning the American aggressors and the Saigon puppet authorities that if they dare to continue to imprison, severely torture, or even openly or secretly murder the three South Vietnamese patriots who were recently arrested, then they must bear all the responsibility for the serious consequences caused by their crimes.
    The statement said that the three patriots are Nguyen Anh Huan, Chen Wenhai, and Wu Kui. They were arrested by the Saigon puppet authorities after a failed attempt to blow up the "Alabama" Hotel, which was exclusively for the use of U.S. troops in Saigon, on January 7th. The statement said that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front demands that the American aggressors and the Saigon puppet authorities immediately release Nguyen Anh Huan, Chen Wenhai, and Wu Kui, as well as the patriotic student Li Hongsi and other patriotic fighters who were arrested several years ago, and fully guarantee their personal safety.

    南越解放通讯社受权发表声明
    警告美伪当局不准杀害三名爱国者
    据新华社河内二十四日电  越南南方解放通讯社受权发表声明，严厉警告美国侵略者和西贡傀儡当局，如果它们竟敢对最近被逮捕的三名南越爱国者继续监禁、严刑拷打，甚至公开地或偷偷摸摸地进行杀害的话，那末就必须承担由它们罪行引起严重后果的全部责任。
    声明说，这三名爱国者是阮英恂，陈文海和武葵。他们是在一月七日计划炸毁专供西贡美军使用的“亚拉巴马”饭店失败后遭到西贡傀儡当局逮捕的。声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线要求美国侵略者和西贡傀儡当局立即释放阮英恂，陈文海和武葵以及几年前被逮捕的爱国学生黎鸿司等爱国志士，并充分保证他们的生命安全。
