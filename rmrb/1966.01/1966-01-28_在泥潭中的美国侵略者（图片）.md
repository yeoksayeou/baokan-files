    American Aggressors in the Mud

    Terror-stricken
    The American aggressors are completely in a position of being passively beaten in South Vietnam. They are terror-stricken and are in danger of being annihilated at any time. The picture shows the US military base in Pleime firing illumination flares all night long, fearing a sudden attack by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army.

    Low Morale
    American aggressors have suffered heavy casualties, and soldiers are generally war-weary.

    Chaotic Logistics
    Due to insufficient port facilities, materials congested in South Vietnamese ports have to wait for weeks or even months before they can be transported away.

    Difficult Supply
    Surrounded by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, the strongholds of the American invading army in South Vietnam have become isolated islands, with supplies difficult to obtain and only able to survive by relying on airdrops.

    Paralyzed Transportation
    In the enemy-occupied areas, transportation hubs such as railways, highways, and bridges have been destroyed by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. The American aggressors have difficulty transporting supplies and can hardly move an inch.

    Widespread Casualties
    Although American imperialism possesses aircraft, artillery, and various modern weapons on the South Vietnamese battlefield, they cannot exert their power under the powerful close-range and night-fighting capabilities of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. The American aggressors have been beaten with widespread casualties.

    在泥潭中的美国侵略者
    胆战心惊
    美国侵略者在南越完全处于被动挨打的地位，他们胆战心惊，随时都有被歼灭的危险。图是波来梅美军基地彻夜乱放照明弹，害怕南越解放军突然进攻。
    士气低落
    美国侵略者伤亡累累，士兵普遍厌战。
    后勤紊乱
    由于港口设备不足，壅塞在南越港口的物资，要等几星期甚至几个月才能运走。
    供应困难
    在越南南方人民武装的包围下，美国侵略军在南越的据点都成了孤岛，物资接济困难，只有靠空投过活。
    交通瘫痪
    在敌占区，铁路、公路和桥梁等交通枢纽，被南越人民武装破坏美国侵略者运输困难，寸步难行。
    伤亡狼藉
    美帝国主义在南越战场上尽管拥有飞机大炮和各种现代化武器，但在南越解放军近战夜战的强大威力下发挥不了作用，美国侵略军被打得伤亡狼藉。
