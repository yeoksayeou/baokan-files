    Determined to Dedicate a Lifetime to Immersing Ourselves Among Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Through participation in labor and the socialist education movement, our thoughts and feelings have changed: from being unwilling to serve the peasants to willingly and happily serving them, not only willing, but also doing everything possible to serve them even better.
    We listened to the words of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and for the past two years, we have been living with the peasant masses, laboring together, and participating in the socialist education movement. In this process, we mainly reformed our thoughts and feelings, and we also performed for them, in addition to doing some club guidance work. Two years is not a long time, but we have understood a truth: all work is for the revolution, and performing is also for the revolution; performing for the revolution is performing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, therefore, "we must go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses, to the fiery struggle, unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time."
    In the past, we stayed in the theater for a long time and did not delve into the fiery struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so bourgeois individualism unconsciously grew. Fame and fortune, personal gains and losses, small family life... we considered these especially often, while how to transform our thinking and how to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers were rarely considered. Therefore, when we first went down to live with the peasants, there was a great distance in our thoughts and feelings. Later, through labor, especially in the socialist education movement, we participated in the class struggle together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, saw their incomparable hatred for capitalist ideas, their clear-cut class feelings of love and hate for comrades and enemies, and their fearless and courageous revolutionary spirit. We received a profound education, and our thoughts, feelings, and standpoints changed accordingly. This change is: from being unwilling to serve the peasants to willingly and happily serving them; not only willing, but also doing everything possible to serve them even better.
    I remember that in the later stage of participating in the socialist education movement in Shanxi, we organized a performance team and traveled day and night in the mountains, bringing small dramas and song and dance programs reflecting socialist life to perform for the peasants in the mountainous areas. Each of us was full of energy and high in fighting spirit. Almost every day we had to climb twenty or thirty li of mountain roads, but no one complained of hardship or let out a sigh. Every time we arrived in a village, as soon as we put down our luggage, we wrote blackboards for the village, drew propaganda posters, and carried out various propaganda activities. In the evening, performances often ended at eleven or twelve o'clock at night, but the next morning, before the villagers got up, we had already swept the courtyard clean and filled the water tank. When the villagers came to see us off, they stuffed handfuls of melon seeds and peanuts into our hands, and gave us the eggs they used to exchange for salt and vinegar. We understood the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, shed tears of excitement, and embarked on a new journey.
    In the process of delving into the lives of the peasant masses and integrating with them, we realized that the countryside is a vast world for literary and art workers to operate in, and also an important front where class enemies are fighting with us in the cultural field. If our socialist culture and art do not occupy it, then the monsters and demons of the bourgeois and feudal classes will occupy it. Therefore, as revolutionary literary and art workers, we realized the important responsibility on our shoulders and understood that we are both ordinary literary and art workers and revolutionary soldiers; the People's Liberation Army takes up guns for the revolution, and we perform for the revolution. We must use socialist literary and artistic weapons to occupy this vast rural front. Because of this, we felt even more that we were far from the requirements of the Party and Chairman Mao, so we are determined to read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, immerse ourselves among the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a lifetime, and be revolutionary actors for a lifetime.

    决心一辈子深入工农兵
    通过参加劳动和社会主义教育运动，我们的思想感情起了变化：由不愿为农民服务，变为甘心情愿为农民服务，不仅愿意，而且千方百计服务得更好。
    我们听了党中央和毛主席的话，最近两年来一直和农民群众生活在一起，一同劳动，一同参加了社会主义教育运动。在这过程中，我们主要是改造思想感情，同时也为他们演出，另外还做些俱乐部辅导工作。两年的时间不算长，但是，我们明白了一个真理：一切工作都是为了革命，演戏也是为了革命；为革命而演戏，就是为工农兵而演戏，因此，“必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。
    以前，我们长时间地呆在剧院里，不深入工农兵的火热斗争，所以不知不觉滋长着资产阶级个人主义思想。名利地位、个人得失、小家庭生活……考虑得特别多，而如何改造思想，如何为工农兵服务，则想得很少。因此，刚下去同农民生活在一起的时候，思想感情上有着很大一段距离。后来，通过劳动，特别是在社会主义教育运动中，我们同贫下中农一起参加了阶级斗争，看到了他们那种对资本主义思想无比痛恨的心情，那种对同志对敌人爱憎分明的阶级感情，那种毫无畏惧、勇往直前的革命精神，受到了深刻的教育，思想、感情、立场随之而起了变化。这个变化就是：由不愿为农民服务，变成心甘情愿为农民服务；不仅愿意，而且千方百计服务得更好。
    曾记得，在山西参加社会主义教育运动的后期，我们组织了一支演出队，日夜奔走在丛山峻岭之中，带着反映社会主义生活内容的小话剧和歌舞节目，送戏上门，为山区的农民演出。我们一个个都是精神抖擞，斗志昂扬。几乎每天都要爬二三十里山路，但谁也没喊过一声苦，松过一口气。每到一个村子，刚放下行装，就给村里写黑板报，画宣传画，进行各种宣传活动。晚上，演出常常到深夜十一、二点才结束，但第二天一清早，没等乡亲们起床，我们就已经把院子扫干净，把水缸担满了。乡亲们来送行的时候，一把瓜子、一把花生地往我们手里塞，把他们用来换盐和醋的鸡蛋送给我们吃。我们心领了贫下中农和社员群众的心意，流着激动的眼泪，踏上了新的路程。
    在深入农民群众的生活，与他们相结合的过程中，我们认识到农村是文艺工作者活动的广阔天地，同时也是阶级敌人在文化战线上跟我们争夺的一个重要阵地。我们社会主义的文化艺术不去占领它，资产阶级、封建阶级的牛鬼蛇神就要去占领它。因此，作为一个革命的文艺工作者，我们意识到了自己肩负着重大的责任，懂得了：我们既是普通的文艺工作者，又是革命战士；解放军拿枪为了革命，我们演戏也是为了革命。我们一定要用社会主义的文艺武器，占领农村这个广阔阵地。正因为这样，我们就越发感觉到离党和毛主席对我们的要求太远了，因此，我们决心一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子深入工农兵，做一辈子的革命演员。
