	Once, a radio factory was trial-producing an important new product and needed a very small seamless steel pipe, only two kilograms. They approached the Yongxin Factory. This kind of steel pipe was as thin as a knitting needle and the wall as thin as kraft paper. It was difficult to manufacture, and the quantity was small. One cadre was reluctant to accept it, believing it was not worthwhile and would lose money. The two sides argued. It happened that an old worker heard about this and, after discussing it with another worker, took on the task. They invested more than one hundred kilograms of raw materials and, after more than a month of trial production, finally produced four liang of qualified products. Now this kind of steel pipe is already in mass production and has made an important contribution to the production of important new products in that factory.

	Accepting this task, from the local perspective of Yongxin, was indeed a loss, but from the perspective of the overall socialist construction, it was a gain. For the benefit of the whole, they consciously suffered this local loss. The local viewpoint and the overall viewpoint, departmentalism and communism are so distinctly different.

    吃亏？得利？
    有一次，一家无线电工厂试制一种重要新产品，需要一种很小的无缝钢管，只要两公斤，找上永鑫厂的门来了。这种钢管，管身象编结绒线的针那么细，管壁象牛皮纸那么薄，很难制造，数量又少，一个干部不乐意接，认为不合算，要亏本，双方争执起来。恰巧一位老工人听到这件事，和另一位工人一商量，把任务接了下来。他们投了一百多公斤的坯料，陆续试了一个多月，终于试出了四两合格品。现在这种钢管已经大量生产。对那家工厂生产重要的新产品作了重要的贡献。
    接受这项任务，从永鑫这个局部看，的确吃了亏，但从社会主义建设的全局看，却是得了利。为了全局的利，他们自觉地吃这局部的亏。局部观点和全局观点，本位主义和共产主义就是如此截然不同。
