    In 1965, I went with the troupe to the rural areas of Lianjiang and Changle to perform for the peasants for four months, and I had many changes in my ideological feelings after contacting many peasants. I originally had an ideological problem that had not been resolved for a long time. In the past, I always thought this way: going to the countryside to perform for the peasants can lead to ideological transformation and improvement, but it is difficult to exercise and improve in art; and going out in the wind and rain will darken the skin and thicken the fingers and waist, which will also affect the “beauty” of my figure. After performing in the countryside, this ideological problem was also initially resolved.
    When I was in Changle, the troupe was rehearsing the new opera "Liu Hulan," and the leadership wanted me to play Liu Hulan. How can I successfully create the glorious image of this young communist party member who "lived greatly and died gloriously"? I was not sure. Who should I learn from? At this time, the leadership enlightened me to follow Chairman Mao's instructions in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and learn from the masses of peasants. At that time, I listened to the leadership and went to the brigade to live, work, and train with the female militia. This period of life was not long, but the ideological demeanor of the female militia, who held their guns tightly for the Party and for the revolution, greatly helped me understand Liu Hulan's ideological feelings. Their firmness, wit, boldness, and bravery made me see the image of rural revolutionary young women. I also learned some basic military training movements from them. In my life with the female militia, I gradually entered the role of Liu Hulan. After returning, in rehearsal, I overcame the shortcomings of being delicate and weak in the initial rehearsals, and both in thought and acting, I greatly strengthened the weight of the role, which basically met the requirements of the plot and the role.
    Through this practice, I deeply realized that the improvement of art is first of all the improvement of thought. Only by turning ideological feelings to the workers, peasants, and soldiers can we create true artistic images of worker-peasant-soldier heroes. Neglecting ideological feelings and only pursuing artistic "improvement" is putting the cart before the horse. If I were to play Liu Hulan without going deep into the female militia, it would be impossible to comprehend the role deeply in terms of thought and character, and to enter the role. If you want to play Liu Hulan, but you don't resemble Liu Hulan, then what art is there to speak of! In the past, I thought that I could not learn art from the peasants. In fact, the art I thought of was the "art of talented scholars and beautiful ladies," not the true art of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, I thought that going to the mountains and the countryside would affect the "beauty" of my figure. In fact, what I thought of was the "beauty of talented scholars and beautiful ladies," and I did not know that my fatal wound was precisely the lack of the true beauty of workers, peasants, and soldiers!
    In the future, I must humbly learn from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, further transform my thinking, and create more perfect artistic images of worker-peasant-soldier heroes on the stage.

    把思想感情转向工农兵
    一九六五年，我随剧团到连江、长乐农村为农民演出了四个月，接触到许多农民，思想感情上有了不少变化。我原来有一个思想问题，长期没有解决。我过去总是这样想，上山下乡为农民演出，在思想上是可以得到改造、提高，但在艺术上锻炼、提高就有困难；并且风里来雨里去，皮肤黑了，手指、腰身粗了，还会影响自己体型的“美”。经过下乡演出，这个思想问题也初步得到了解决。
    在长乐时，正好团里排新戏《刘胡兰》，领导上要我扮演刘胡兰。怎样才能成功地塑造这位“生的伟大，死的光荣”的年青女共产党员的光辉形象？我没有把握。该向谁去学呢？这时，领导上启发我遵照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的指示，到农民群众中去学。当时，我听领导的话，下大队去和女民兵一起生活、劳动、训练。这段生活时间不算长，但女民兵们为党、为革命紧握手中枪的思想风貌，大大帮助我体会到刘胡兰的思想感情。她们坚定、机智、泼辣、勇敢，使我看到了农村革命女青年的形象。我还向她们学习了一些军事训练的基本动作。我在和女民兵共同生活中，逐渐进入了刘胡兰这个角色。回来后，在排练中，我克服了初排时娇弱无力的缺点，无论在思想上、演技上都大大加强了角色的分量，基本上符合了剧情和角色的要求。
    通过这次实践，我深深体会到艺术的提高，首先是思想的提高，只有把思想感情转到工农兵方面，才可能创造出真正的工农兵英雄的艺术形象。不问思想感情，只求艺术“提高”，这是本末倒置。我演刘胡兰，假使不深入到女民兵中去，就不可能从思想、性格上较深刻地去领会角色，进入角色。要演刘胡兰，但又演不象刘胡兰，那还有什么艺术可言！我过去认为向农民学不到艺术，其实，我所想的艺术，是“才子佳人”的“艺术”，而不是工农兵的真正的艺术；过去认为上山下乡会影响自己体型的“美”，其实，我所想的是“才子佳人”的“美”，而不知道自己的致命伤正是缺乏真正的工农兵的美！
    今后，我一定要虚心地向工农兵群众学习，进一步改造思想，在舞台上创造出更多更完美的工农兵英雄的艺术形象。
