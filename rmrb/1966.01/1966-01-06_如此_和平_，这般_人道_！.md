    Such "humanity," such "humanity"! Killing without regard for men, women, old, or young.
  "Peace," "peace"! Everywhere, wanton killing, looting, and arson.
  "Justice," "justice"! Exhausting gasoline, poison gas, and fleas.
  The Japanese devils were not as savage, the Nazi bandits were not as brutal. This is a group of beasts in human skin; this is a gang of inhuman robbers. Blood debts must be repaid, deep hatred must be avenged, and the executioners will never lay down their butcher knives themselves!

    如此“和平”，这般“人道”！
    池北偶 “人道”，“人道”，杀人不分男女老少。
  “和平”，“和平”，到处狂杀、乱抢、滥烧。
  “正义”，“正义”，用尽汽油、毒气、跳蚤。
  日本鬼子没它野蛮，纳粹匪徒没它残暴。这是一群披着人皮的禽兽，这是一伙灭绝人性的强盗。血债一定要还，深仇一定要报，刽子手绝不会自己放下屠刀！
