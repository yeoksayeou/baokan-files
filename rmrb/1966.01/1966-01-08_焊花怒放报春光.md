    Welding Sparks Rage, Announcing the Arrival of Spring
    Shanghai Hudong Shipyard Worker Ju Yousong
    The ground is frozen, the wind howls, the sky is full of frost,
    The shipyard's cold night shines brightly with lights,
    The light shines thousands of miles away,
    The moon hangs on the ship's mast.
    Young men take the lead,
    Jumping into the hold to weld steel beams,
    Their chests thump like thunder,
    Shaking the night sky with resonant sounds.
    Young women refuse to be outdone,
    Jumping onto the deck to weld the mast walls,
    A loud shout makes the wind spin,
    Welding sparks rage, filling the sky.
    Chests pressed tightly against the steel plate,
    Hands pulling long welding seams,
    The red-hot weld is like an arrowhead,
    Moving straight upwards without stopping for a second.
    Cranes wave their steel arms,
    Hoisting steel and transporting iron busily back and forth,
    Sledgehammers beat a drum that echoes through the heavens,
    A victorious start to a good battle.
    Heat melts the snow in the sky,
    Welding sparks rage, announcing the arrival of spring,
    We are welding a giant ship of the times,
    Pulling the Third Five-Year Plan forward.

    焊花怒放报春光
    沪东造船厂工人　居有松地冻风吼满天霜，船厂寒夜灯辉煌，灯光照向千里外，月亮挂在船桅上。青年小伙打头阵，跳下船舱焊钢梁，胸脯一拍响如雷，震得夜空??响。青年姑娘死不让，跳上甲板焊桅墙，一声大喝风打转，焊花怒放漫天扬。胸口贴紧钢板上，手儿拉得焊缝长，通红焊缝象箭头，一秒不停直向上。吊车挥舞钢铁臂，吊钢运铁来回忙，大锤擂起通天鼓，旗开得胜打好仗。热气溶化漫天雪，焊花怒放报春光，咱们焊的时代大巨轮，拉着第三个五年计划向前航。
