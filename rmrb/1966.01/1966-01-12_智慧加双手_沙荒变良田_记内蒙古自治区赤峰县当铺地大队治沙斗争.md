    Wisdom plus Hands: Sandy Waste Turns into Fertile Fields
    -- A Record of the Sand Control Struggle of the Dangpudi Brigade in Chifeng County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    The Dangpudi Brigade has worked hard for more than ten years, carrying out large-scale afforestation in the sandy wasteland, building water conservancy projects, and constructing farmland that guarantees harvests regardless of drought or flood. The achievement of the Dangpudi Brigade in transforming nature is the result of resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions, relying on collective strength, and engaging in revolution through self-reliance. After overthrowing the "three great mountains," they continued to fight tenaciously against harsh natural conditions and achieved one victory after another.
    After achieving great success, the Dangpudi people used the high standards of Dazhai to strictly demand of themselves, identified seven gaps compared to Dazhai, and took big steps to catch up. "Modesty helps one to progress," and greater victories await them.
    The National Dazhai-style Agricultural Typical Exhibition Hall is a vivid classroom. Here, people are full of admiration for the Dangpudi Brigade of the Dangpudi Commune in Chifeng County, Inner Mongolia.
    From the many photos of the Dangpudi Brigade on display, people can see that there are networks of forest belts, orchards, crisscrossing canals, abundant water and grass, fat cattle and sheep, thriving crops, and the entire village is a scene of lush green reflecting the blue sky.
    Looking at this thriving scene, who would have thought that fifteen years ago this was still a place where wind and sand raged, floods raged, and farmers could not settle down?
    Dangpudi has historically been a well-known old disaster area. Before liberation, the village was surrounded by sand dunes on the east, west, and north sides, and the Yin River on the south side was flooded in the rainy season and filled with rolling white sand in the dry season. The fields were full of sand dunes, and more than 9,000 mu of land were divided into more than 600 plots by sand dunes. More than 20 sand dragons lay across the fields, and there were more than 200 large sand dunes occupying more than two mu, and countless small sand dunes. There are especially many windy days here. When a strong wind blows, the yellow sand obscures the sun, and the shifting sand blocks the doors and buries the houses. In the spring, due to drought, farmers often cannot plant their fields on time.
    Such harsh natural conditions, coupled with the exploitation of the landlord class, led to disasters in Dangpudi every year before liberation. The farmers were destitute, and people fled famine every year, the population became smaller and smaller, and the land became more and more barren, and most of the land became sandbars.

              Organize and Divert Water

    In 1947, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Dangpudi, through land reform, overthrew the landlord class, and the landless and land-poor farmers were given land. However, natural disasters continued to rage. In this year, a big wind and a big flood caused almost all the farmland to be lost. The individual small-scale peasant economy could not withstand the blows of natural disasters. Some poor and lower-middle peasants who had just been given land had to sell their land with tears, and many people had to rely on state relief to maintain their lives. People said: The Communist Party has come and led us to overthrow the landlords and overthrow the "three great mountains" on our heads. Are we still going to be bullied by God?
    The newly established Dangpudi Party branch, seeing the disaster situation and hearing the voices of the farmers, held a meeting to study and proposed "Overthrowing the landlord class and distributing the land to the farmers only solves the prerequisite for turning from poor to rich. How can farmers generally turn from poor to rich? Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and taking the road of organization." Therefore, led by Communist Party members, they embarked on the road of organization. In 1950, the Party branch proposed the slogan of "Repairing canals and planting trees to prevent wind and fix sand" and raised the banner of fighting against wind and sand. At that time, many people lacked confidence. They said that many people had planted trees in the past, but none of them survived. This ghostly place in Dangpudi is destined to be without trees. However, some poor peasant activists took a different attitude. They said that now that we have the leadership of the Communist Party, we have turned ourselves over, the land is our own land, and the water is our own water. We should work hard, and we don't believe that we can't subdue the wind and sand! Therefore, they took the lead in going to each household to connect with each other, and finally passed the canal repair and afforestation plan proposed by the Party branch at the village mass meeting. More than 70 people participated in the first battle against nature - repairing canals to divert water.
    However, the class enemies who were unwilling to die came out to make trouble again, trying to block the people's path forward. Therefore, this production struggle was intertwined with class struggle from the very beginning. As soon as the canal repair started, the landlord elements came out to spread rumors, saying: "The old people said that there is a sand leak here. Even if the canal is built, the water will leak out." The poor and lower-middle peasants who had already mastered their own destiny and were determined to change the world ignored the class enemies' nonsense and continued to dig canals to divert water. However, the newly built canal did have water leakage continuously. In this way, a few people wavered.
    In order to find out the truth, the Party branch studied the causes of the water leakage on the one hand and sent people to guard the canal on the other. Finally, it was discovered that the canal was sabotaged by class enemies twice. The Party branch announced the truth to everyone, and the people received a profound class education, realizing that they could not forget class struggle when carrying out production struggle. The victory of this class struggle inspired the people's revolutionary spirit, and everyone's enthusiasm for repairing canals became even greater. After the main canal was completed, branch canals were built. After all the canals were completed, 800 mu of farmland were irrigated in the same year, and a good harvest was obtained. The people of Dangpudi tasted the sweetness of being organized and fighting against nature for the first time.

              Trees Blocking Wind and Forest Belts Protecting Fields

    Repairing canals to divert water can only solve the irrigation problem of some farmland. The relentless wind and sand continued to cause havoc, and the newly built canals were often filled by the sand brought by strong winds, and people had to clean them again and again. In order to protect the canals and block the wind and sand, trees must be planted.
    Planting trees is something the people of Dangpudi have dreamed of. Some people have planted trees three times, but they have not survived. Planting trees by individual households did not survive, and planting trees in the first year of establishing mutual aid groups also failed. However, the strong Dangpudi Party branch did not lose heart because of failure. They seriously summed up the experience and lessons and looked for the reasons. Communist Party members Liu Zhenguo and Chen Hongen and others often circled the sand dunes of the "Tianjia Tree Forest" in order to find the secret of why the trees did not survive, and sometimes went to the small woods in neighboring villages to observe. They looked at the trees and talked to the people who planted the trees, repeatedly investigated and studied, and finally discovered three reasons why the trees did not survive. After finding the reasons, the Party branch called on the masses to hold meetings and talked to activists individually, telling everyone that if they wanted to plant trees that would survive, the tree planters must have the idea of planting trees that would survive. At the same time, they publicized the principle of "Trees blocking wind" and proposed to afforest on a large scale.
    The people's thinking was clear, their confidence was high, and their enthusiasm for planting trees was also high. Starting in 1951, the people of Dangpudi began to afforest in large areas and paid attention to quality. Ninety percent of the trees planted in the same year survived. This shot was fired, greatly boosting morale. In a few years, the bank protection forests along the canals and rivers were planted. People were considering the next direction of advance, and the Party branch timely proposed a plan to build farmland protection forest belts. However, individual ownership restricted the implementation of the plan to build farmland protection forest belts. In 1955, the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives realized the plan to comprehensively build protection forest belts after two years of effort. After the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, the wisdom and creativity of the people of Dangpudi were further liberated, and they created many new methods of planting trees. In places near the water on the canals and river banks, they used the method of "goose wing cuttings" to insert willow branches along the direction of the water flow, which had a high survival rate and strong bank protection. In recent years, they have used the law that fewer trees and small patches attract sand dunes to plant an eight-li long bank protection forest, forming a large sand dam outside the forest. The trees are long and the sand is high, and the trees are even higher. This forest belt sand dam not only blocks the movement of sand dunes, but also blocks the Yin River water outside the forest belt sand dam, so that flooding is controlled to a certain extent.

          "Water Dragging Sand Dragons" "Wind Moving Sand Dunes"

    While planting trees and making forests, the Party branch proposed to move away the high and low sand dunes on the more than 9,000 mu of land to facilitate leveling the land and diverting water for irrigation. This bold initiative aroused another debate: "Can this be done?" "How much time will it take? How much labor will it require?" Therefore, the Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The branch secretary said to everyone: "Sand is dead, and people are alive. If the Foolish Old Man can move the mountains, can't our collective of thousands of people move the sand dunes?" After study and discussion, the people's courage increased greatly, and their wisdom and talents were also displayed.
    When repairing canals to divert water, some people discovered the principle that "sand follows water." The sand on the side of the canal fell into the water and flowed downstream. Therefore, people consciously threw sand into the water, and as much as they threw, it would flow away with the water. The greater the water flow, the more sand was transported. After unconscious to conscious experiments, the people of Dangpudi adopted this method of killing two birds with one stone, transporting sand with water and irrigating fields with water. Some people also gave this method a name called "Water Dragging Sand Dragons." At first, people used water to send the sand from high places to low places, and later they took it a step further, even diverting water to the top of the sand dragon and digging a winding canal, using the impact of the water back and forth to carry away the sand. One plan succeeded, and another plan was inspired. Some people thought that one canal was too slow to transport sand, and created a "chicken claw" canal, with each canal leading from the top of the sand dune to the low-lying area, leveling the sand dune and filling the low-lying area.
    The success of "Water Dragging Sand Dragons" gave people a lot of inspiration, so some people wanted to use wind power to transport sand. They said that sand dunes are formed by wind, so why can't the wind level them again? Wind can be harmful, can't it be beneficial? Therefore, they gave the sand dunes a "haircut" and shoveled off the grass on the top of the sand dunes. Sure enough, as much as they shaved, the wind blew away. Some people simply dug open the sand dunes, and a strong wind blew away half of the sand dunes. The Party branch timely summed up this experience of the masses, organized the masses to split each sand dune in half according to the wind direction, divide one into two, and two into four, using the wind power to turn large sand dunes into small ones and level small sand dunes. They also built wind-facing dams in low-lying areas, using the sand blown by the wind to raise the low-lying areas.
    The people of Dangpudi used their intelligence and wisdom to use wind and water to transport sand, saving time and a lot of labor. However, they are not afraid of hard work and are not afraid of sweating more. Wind and water cannot move all the sand dunes away, and the rest is carried and lifted by people. For more than ten years, the people of Dangpudi used their wisdom, hands and two shoulders to move away all the sand dragons, sand dunes, and sand hills, a total of about 2 million cubic meters of sand.

              Finding Gaps and Catching Up with Dazhai

    Relying on collective strength, the people of Dangpudi have transformed the sandy wasteland into an oasis after more than ten years of hard struggle. They have built a 12-li long water diversion main canal and a 30-li long branch canal, and drilled machine wells, so that more than 4,900 mu of cultivated land have been irrigated and guaranteed harvests regardless of drought or flood; more than 3,000 mu of sandy land have been turned into fertile land with a soil layer of one or two feet thick after diverting flood siltation. At the same time, they have afforested 2,825 mu, with crisscrossing forest belts protecting all the farmland. They have also developed animal husbandry and diversified operations. Before liberation, there was only one mule, three horses, and fourteen cattle. Now there are 75 horses, 27 mules, 94 cattle, and the number of sheep and pigs has also increased several times. Due to the great development of production, Dangpudi has leapt from eating state relief grain in the early days of liberation to providing a large amount of commodity grain to the state. In 1964 alone, it provided 540,000 jin of commodity grain to the state. With the great development of production, the living standards of the commune members have been continuously improved, and the collective economy has been increasingly consolidated and developed. Now, the Dangpudi Brigade has a public accumulation of 150,000 yuan. Eighty percent of the commune members have built new houses, and more than ninety percent of school-age children have attended school.
    However, the people of Dangpudi are not satisfied with the existing achievements and continue to take Dazhai as an example and demand themselves with high standards.
    In the spring of 1964, Chen Hongen, the current Party branch secretary, was greatly encouraged after listening to the report on the Dazhai people's self-reliance and hard work. He thought that the Dazhai people could achieve a grain yield of 700 to 800 jin per mu under the natural conditions of seven gullies, eight ridges, and one slope, while the current natural conditions in Dangpudi are much better than Dazhai, and the grain yield per mu is only more than 200 jin. How can this be justified? When he returned to the brigade, he called on the cadres to hold a meeting, introduced the revolutionary spirit and entrepreneurial experience of the Dazhai people to everyone, and took the lead in strictly examining himself with the high standards of the Dazhai people. They compared themselves with Dazhai and found out the gaps of "three advantages and seven disadvatages". That is, the land, water conservancy, and tools are better than Dazhai; but the ambition is not as good as Dazhai, the spirit of striving for self-reliance is not as good as Dazhai, the enthusiasm for production is not as good as Dazhai, the cadres' participation in labor and scientific experiments is not as good as Dazhai, the communist style is not as good as Dazhai, intensive farming is not as good as Dazhai, and the cadres' basic skills in leading production are not as good as Dazhai. The revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people has led the thinking of the Dangpudi people to a high level and has taken a big step forward, catching up quickly. In 1964, the Dangpudi Brigade newly built seven dike protection forests, seven T-shaped dams, afforested 200 mu, replanted 360 mu of original protection forests, actively carried out farmland capital construction, further implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture, reformed cultivation techniques, and the average yield of grain per mu increased from 205 jin in 1963 to 358 jin. In 1965, it jumped over 400 jin again. They not only learn the Dazhai people's spirit of hard work, but also learn the Dazhai people's noble revolutionary style. In 1964, they supported brother communes and teams with 38,000 tree strips and 350,000 saplings for afforestation.

    智慧加双手　沙荒变良田
    ——记内蒙古自治区赤峰县当铺地大队治沙斗争
    当铺地大队艰苦奋斗十几年，在沙荒上大规模造林，兴修水利，建设旱涝保收田。当铺地大队改天换地的成就，是坚决按照毛主席的指示，依靠集体力量，自力更生闹革命的结果。他们推翻了“三座大山”以后，继续顽强地向恶劣的自然条件作斗争，取得一个又一个胜利。
    当铺地人民在取得巨大成绩以后，又用大寨人的高标准严格地要求自己，找出七个不如大寨的差距，迈开大步奋起直追。“虚心使人进步”，更大的胜利在等待着他们。
    全国大寨式农业典型展览馆是一个生动的课堂。在这里，人们对内蒙古赤峰县当铺地公社当铺地大队赞佩不已。
    从展出的当铺地大队的许多照片上，人们看到，这里林带成网，果树成片，渠道纵横，水草丰盛，牛羊肥壮，庄稼竞长，村里村外一片青纱映碧空。
    看到这种欣欣向荣的景象，有谁会想到十五年前这里还是一个风沙逞凶，洪水横流，农民不能安身的地方呢？
    当铺地在历史上是有名的老灾区。解放前，村庄的东、西、北三面被沙包围，南面又是雨季洪水泛滥、旱季白沙滚滚的阴河。田野里到处是沙包，九千多亩土地被沙丘分割成六百多块，二十多条沙龙横卧田间，占地两亩以上的大沙包就有二百多个，小沙包无法数计。这里刮风天特别多。刮起大风时，黄沙蔽日，流沙堵门埋房。春天因旱，农民往往无法按时种田。
    这样恶劣的自然条件，加上地主阶级的盘剥，解放前的当铺地，年年成灾，农民一贫如洗，每年都有人出外逃荒，人口越来越少，土地越来越荒凉，大多数土地变成了沙洲。
              组织起来　开渠引水
    一九四七年，当铺地人在共产党领导下，经过土地改革，打倒了地主阶级，无地和少地的农民分得了土地。但是自然灾害仍然逞凶。这一年，一场大风，一场洪水，全部农田几乎失收。个体小农经济经受不起自然灾害的打击，有些刚刚分得土地的贫雇农，又含泪要出卖土地，许多人只好依靠国家救济维持生活。人们说：共产党来了，领导咱们打倒了地主，推翻了压在头上的“三座大山”，难道还要受老天爷的欺吗？
    刚刚建立起来的当铺地党支部，看到受灾的情景，听到农民的呼声，就开会研究，并且提出“打倒地主阶级，把土地分给农民，只是解决了由穷变富的前提，怎样使农民普遍由穷变富，只有按照毛主席的教导，走组织起来这条路。”于是，由共产党员带头，走上组织起来的道路。一九五○年，党支部又提出“修渠造林，防风固沙”的号召，树起了向风沙开战的旗帜。当时，有不少人缺乏信心。他们说，过去有多少人栽树，都没栽活，当铺地这鬼地方就是和树无缘。然而一些贫农积极分子却抱着另一种态度。他们说，现在有共产党的领导，咱们翻了身，地是自己的地，水是自己的水，应当好好干一场，咱就不信治服不了风沙！于是，他们带头到各家各户串连，终于在全村群众大会上通过了党支部提出的修渠造林计划，有七十多人参加了同自然斗争的第一个战役——修渠引水。
    可是不甘心死亡的阶级敌人，又出来兴风作浪，妄想堵住人们前进的道路。因此，这场生产斗争一开始就和阶级斗争交织在一起。修渠刚开始，地主分子就出来放风，说什么：“老辈子人说过，这里有沙漏，渠修成，水也得漏光。”已经掌握了自己命运，决心改天换地的贫农下中农，不管阶级敌人的胡言乱语，继续挖渠引水。可是，新修的渠道果然连续发生跑水现象。这样，就有少数的人动摇了。
    党支部为弄清真象，一面研究漏水的原因，一面派人看守渠道。终于发现原来渠道两次漏水都是阶级敌人破坏的。党支部向大家公布了事实真象，人们受到一次深刻的阶级教育，认识到在进行生产斗争的时候，也不能忘记阶级斗争。这次阶级斗争的胜利，鼓舞了人们的革命斗志，大家修渠的劲头更大了，修成干渠接着又修支渠。水渠全部修成以后，当年就灌溉了八百亩农田，获得了好收成。当铺地人第一次尝到了组织起来和自然斗争的甜头。
              群树挡风　林带护田
    修渠引水，只能解决部分农田的灌溉问题。无情的风沙仍然逞凶作恶，新修的渠道常常被大风带来的沙子填平，人们只得一遍又一遍地清理。为了护渠和挡住风沙，就得栽树。
    栽树，这是当铺地人梦寐以求的事。有些人曾三番五次地栽过树，就是栽不活。一家一户栽树栽不活，成立互助组的头一年栽树也失败了。可是，坚强的当铺地党支部，没有因为失败而灰心，他们认真地总结经验教训，找原因。共产党员刘振国和陈洪恩等人，为了寻找栽不活树的秘密，常常围着“田家树林”的沙包上转，有时还到邻村小树林里去观察。他们看树，又找栽树的人谈，反复考察研究，终于发现了栽树不活的三条原因。找到原因以后，党支部就召集群众开会，找积极分子个别谈话，告诉大家，要栽活树，栽树人就要有栽活树的思想。同时宣传“群树挡风”的道理，提出要大面积造林。
    人们的思想通了，信心高了，栽树的积极性也高起来了。从一九五一年开始，当铺地人开始大片造林，而且注意质量，当年栽的树百分之九十都活了。这一炮打响了，大大鼓舞了士气，没几年，渠边、河边的护岸林都栽起来了。人们又在考虑下一步的前进方向，党支部及时提出营造农田防护林带的计划。可是个体所有制限制了营造农田防护林带计划的实现。一九五五年成立高级农业合作社，全面营造防护林带的规划，经过两年的努力就实现了。一九五八年人民公社建立以后，当铺地人的智慧和创造力，得到进一步的解放，创造了不少新的植树造林方法。在渠道河边靠水的地方，他们用“雁翅插条”的办法，随水流方向插上杨柳枝条，成活率高，护岸力又强。几年来，他们利用树少片小招沙包的规律，栽成了一条八里长的护岸林，使林外形成一条大沙坝。树长沙高，树更高。这条林带沙坝，既挡住了沙包的移动，也把阴河水挡在林带沙坝以外，使洪水泛滥得到一定的控制。
          “水拖沙龙”　“风搬沙包”
    在植树造林的同时，党支部提出要把九千多亩土地上高高低低的大小沙包搬走，以利于平整土地和引水灌溉。这个大胆的创议一提出来，又引起一番争论：“这能办得到吗？”“这得多少时间？需要多少人工？”于是，党支部就组织大家学习毛主席的著作《愚公移山》。支部书记对大家说：“沙是死的，人是活的。愚公能移山，我们上千人组成的集体，难道就搬不走沙包吗？”经过学习和讨论，人们勇气大增，智慧和才能也得到施展。
    在修渠引水的时候，有人发现“沙随水走”的道理。渠边上的沙子落在水里，就顺流而下。于是人们就有意识地往水里扬沙子，扬多少，就随水流走多少。水流越大，运走的沙越多。经过无意识到有意识的试验，当铺地人就采取这个一举两得的办法，用水运走了沙子，又用水灌了田。有人还给这种办法起了一个名字叫“水拖沙龙”。开始人们利用水把高处的沙子送往低处，后来又进了一步，竟把水引到沙龙顶上，挖开一道弯弯渠，借水来回的冲撞力把沙子带走。一计成功，又激起一计。有人嫌一道渠运沙太慢，又创造了“鸡爪型”渠道，条条渠道从沙包顶上通向洼处，拖平了沙包，又填平了洼地。
      “水拖沙龙”成功，给人的启发很大，于是有人想利用风力运沙。他们说沙包是风吹成的，为什么不能再让风吹平呢？风能为害，难道就不能为利？于是，他们就给沙包“剃头”，把沙包顶上的草铲掉。果然剃多少风吹走多少。有人索性把沙包扒开，一场大风就把沙包吹走一半。党支部及时总结了群众的这个经验，组织群众按着风向，把每个沙包都劈成两半，一分为二，二分为四，利用风力把大沙包变小，把小沙包削平。他们还在低洼处修筑迎风坝，利用风吹来的沙把低洼处垫高。
    当铺地人利用自己的聪明智慧，利用风、水运沙，节约了时间和大量的劳动力。但是，他们也不怕艰苦的劳动，不怕多流汗。风和水不能把全部沙包搬走削平，剩下来的就由人挑、人抬。十几年来，当铺地人用自己的智慧、双手和两个肩膀，搬走了全部沙龙、沙包、沙丘，共约两百多万立方米的沙子。
              找差距　赶大寨
    当铺地人依靠集体力量，经过十几年的艰苦奋斗，把沙荒变成绿洲。他们修建了长达十二华里的引水干渠和三十多华里的支渠，打了机井，使四千九百多亩耕地得到灌溉，旱涝保收；三千多亩沙地经过引洪淤澄，变为土层厚达一两尺的良田。同时，他们造林二千八百二十五亩，林带纵横交错，保护着所有的农田。他们还发展畜牧业和多种经营。解放前，这里的大牲口只有一匹骡、三匹马、十四头牛，如今有马七十五匹、骡子二十七匹、牛九十四头，羊和猪也增加了好几倍。由于生产大发展，当铺地由解放初期吃国家救济粮，跃进到为国家提供大量的商品粮。光是一九六四年，就给国家提供了五十四万斤商品粮。生产大发展，社员生活不断改善，集体经济也日益巩固和发展壮大。现在，当铺地大队拥有公共积累十五万元。百分之八十的社员盖了新房，百分之九十以上的适龄儿童上了学校。
    然而，当铺地人不满足于现有成绩，继续以大寨为榜样，用高标准要求自己。
    一九六四年春天，现任党支部书记陈洪恩听了关于大寨人自力更生、艰苦创业的报告，受到很大的鼓舞。他想，大寨人在七沟八梁一面坡的自然条件下，能达到粮食亩产七八百斤，而当铺地现在的自然条件比大寨好得多，亩产粮食只有二百多斤，怎么能说得过去呢？他回到大队就召集干部开会，向大家介绍了大寨人的革命精神和创业经验，并带头用大寨人的高标准，严格检查自己。他们用大寨比自己，找出“三有利和七不如”的差距。这就是土地、水利、工具比大寨好；可是雄心壮志不如大寨，奋发图强自力更生精神不如大寨，生产干劲不如大寨，干部参加劳动、搞科学实验不如大寨，共产主义风格不如大寨，精耕细作不如大寨，干部领导生产的基本功不如大寨。大寨人的革命精神，把当铺地人的思想引向了高处，又朝前迈开了大步，急起直追。一九六四年，当铺地大队就新修了七条护堤林，七道丁字坝，新造林二百亩，补植原有防护林三百六十亩，积极开展农田基本建设，进一步贯彻农业“八字宪法”，改革耕作技术，粮食的平均亩产量由一九六三年的二百零五斤提高到三百五十八斤。一九六五年又跳过了四百斤。他们不仅学习大寨人的艰苦创业精神，也学大寨人高尚的革命风格。一九六四年，他们支援兄弟社队造林用的树条三万八千株，树苗三十五万棵。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　新华社记者（附图片）
