　　Former "Lang Sheng," Now Master
　　By studying Chairman Mao's writings, I broadened my horizons and learned how to work, how to conduct myself, and how to contribute to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.
　　At the beginning of the New Year, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, I feel very excited. In 1965, through the arduous efforts of the emancipated serfs in the whole township, we achieved the seventh bumper harvest year since the democratic reform. The total grain output of the township increased by 30 percent compared with 1964. The bumper harvest has further improved the lives of the farmers throughout the township, especially the poor farmers. Every household has their granaries full. This is truly a remarkable change, something that people under the feudal serf system dared not dream of. At that time, poor serfs and slaves were regarded by the serf owners as "livestock that can talk," and were "working hard in the fields but not entitled to food." It was often the case that "once the threshing is done, the food supply is cut off." Almost all the gains from a year of hard work were snatched away by temples, officials, and nobles, and many people had to go out to beg for food after the autumn harvest. I was forced to leave my hometown in the Shannan region at the age of sixteen and wandered to Tongga, where I became a "Lang Sheng" (slave) for a lord.

　　In 1965, I was honored to be elected as a representative to the First People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region and a representative to the People's Congress of Lhasa City, exercising the right to be the master of my own affairs. All these make me realize that I have a great responsibility, and I must work hard and continue to move forward. I insist on working with the masses and taking on more heavy work. And I ask other cadres and activists in the township to do the same. During the autumn harvest and threshing season, the farm work is very tight, so our cadres go to the fields under the stars in the morning and return to the village with the stars on our backs at night, working desperately. The masses see that the cadres are doing this, so they follow suit and successfully complete the task.

　　The long-term "Lang Sheng" life in the old society made me uneducated, and it was difficult for me to study Chairman Mao's writings. But I'm not afraid of difficulties. I use the method of "a slow bird flies early," studying diligently, assiduously, and extensively. Others study it once, but I study it many times. In addition to insisting on studying with the masses, I also often ask the cadres working in the township to read and explain it to me; when my daughter comes home from school at night, I always ask her to read some of Chairman Mao's writings to me. Studying has broadened my horizons, and I know how to work, how to conduct myself, and how to contribute to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

　　The masses saw that after I and other cadres studied Chairman Mao's writings, our work style improved, we worked more actively, and we cared more about them, so they also studied Chairman Mao's writings more actively. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao gave us zanba and the right to be human, we must read Chairman Mao's books." Therefore, even in the most stressful times of farm work, we did not relax our study and insisted on learning and applying it in a living way.

　　In order to win this year's bumper harvest, in this cold winter season, we have begun to transform low-yield fields and accumulate fertilizer, and the masses in the whole township are full of energy. Everyone said, "If you have walnuts, it's not difficult to find stones. No matter how great the difficulties, with Mao Zedong Thought and the people of Dazhai as our example, what are we afraid of?"

　　In the New Year, I will study Chairman Mao's writings even better, insist on participating in labor, and greet the Third Five-Year Plan with practical actions of leading the farmers of the whole township to produce more grain.

    昔日“朗生”，今之主人
    学习毛主席著作，我开阔了眼界，知道应该怎样工作，怎样做人，怎样对中国革命和世界革命作出贡献
    在新的一年开头，回顾过去，展望未来，我感到十分兴奋。在一九六五年，经过全乡翻身农奴的艰苦努力，我们获得了民主改革后的第七个丰收年。全乡粮食产量比一九六四年增加了百分之三十。丰收使全乡农民特别是贫苦农民的生活有了更进一步的改善。家家户户粮食堆满仓。这真是个了不起的变化，是封建农奴制度下人们不敢想望的事。那时，贫苦农奴和奴隶被农奴主看做“会说话的牲畜”，是“种田出力，吃粮没份”。往往是“打完场，断口粮”。辛苦一年所得，几乎全被寺庙、官家和贵族抢走，许多人秋收后就得外出讨饭。我就是被逼得没法，十六岁从老家山南地区流落到通嘎这地方，给领主当了“朗生”（奴隶）。
    一九六五年，我光荣地被选为西藏自治区第一届人民代表大会代表和拉萨市人民代表大会代表，行使当家作主的权利。这些，都使我明白自己责任重大，更要艰苦奋斗，不断前进。我坚持和群众一起劳动，多拣重活干。并且要求乡里其他干部和积极分子也这么做。秋收、打场时农活很紧，我们干部就早晨顶着星星下地，晚上背着星星回村，拼命干活。群众看到干部这么干，也就跟着干，顺利地完成了任务。
    旧社会长期的“朗生”生活，使我没有文化，学习毛主席著作有困难。可我不怕难。我用“笨鸟先飞”的办法，勤学、苦学、多学。别人学一遍，我却学许多遍。平常除坚持和群众一道学习外，还经常请在乡上工作的干部讲读；晚上女儿放学了，我总要让她给我念点毛主席著作。学习使我开阔了眼界，知道应该怎样工作，怎样做人，怎样对中国革命和世界革命作出贡献。
    群众看到我和其他干部学习毛主席著作后作风改进了，劳动更积极了，更关心他们了，也更积极地学习毛主席著作。大家说：“毛主席给了我们糌粑和做人的权利，毛主席的书一定要读。”因此，即使在农活最紧张的时刻，我们也没有放松学习，并且坚持活学活用。
    我们为了夺取今年的丰收，在这隆冬的季节里，开始了改造低产田和积肥活动，全乡群众干劲十足。大家说：“有核桃就不难找到石头。困难再大，有毛泽东思想，有大寨人作榜样，怕啥？”
    在新的一年里，我要更好地学习毛主席著作，坚持参加劳动，用带领全乡农民多打粮食的实际行动，迎接第三个五年计划。
