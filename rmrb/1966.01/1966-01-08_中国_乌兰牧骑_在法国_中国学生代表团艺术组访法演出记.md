    China's "Ulanmuqi" in France
    ——A Record of Performances by the Chinese Student Delegation's Art Group in France
    Unprecedented Novelty
    Marseille, one of the world's famous cities, had never seen anything so novel: a group of young people with yellow skin and black hair transformed a square into a stage and began street performances. Suddenly, the music of stringed instruments became melodious, red silk ribbons fluttered, and the lively scene transformed the windows of the surrounding buildings into viewing platforms. After several such performances, the Marseille newspaper *Le Marseillais* published an eye-catching piece of news, which stated: "This is a high-quality performance, the Chinese have conquered Marseille..."
    It turned out that the group performing in this famous city was not a large "art troupe," but a "small team" in the style of China's "Ulanmuqi." It was the art group of the Chinese student delegation, invited by the French National Student Union to participate in the 13th International University Cultural Festival held in Marseille in September 1965. In total, there were only seven young people.
    This art group consisted of three women and four men, a total of seven young people. An accordion, a tape recorder for playing accompaniment music, a few dance costumes, and some simple props were all they had. They packed these things in a suitcase, carried it with them, and lightly crossed Europe to Marseille.
    The festival of friendship began. Whether performing alone or jointly with students from other countries, the seven members of the Chinese student delegation's art group filled the stage with excitement. The performances of the four members, Yu Hong, Zhang Yujuan, Chen Keyu, and Chen Liwen, allowed friends from various countries to see a variety of dances: "Red Silk Dance," "Female Militia," "Harvest Dance," "Hard Years," "Bow Dance," and "Shepherdess"; Fan Yongsheng and Rebiya sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "On the Grassland Rises a Red Sun," "I Drive a Cart with Joy," "Ode to Red Plum," "Dombra," and "The Train Arrived in the Gobi Desert"; Ren Shirong played accordion pieces "Reminiscences of Yan'an," "Twisting Yangko to Celebrate the Harvest," and the French song "Song of the Partisans."
    The performances of the Chinese student delegation deeply attracted the audience from France and other countries. Regardless of the performance, each program aroused warm applause, and many programs would not stop without an encore. Several times after the performance, the audience flocked backstage to shake hands with the Chinese actors, some young people came to congratulate the next day with flowers, praising the Chinese actors for being "full of spirit" and the performances "filled with confidence," and some even asked to learn the Chinese "Red Silk Dance" and other dances. They performed wherever they went.
    During the festival and after its closing, the Chinese student delegation, as guests of the French National Student Union, visited six large, medium, and small cities, including Paris and Lyon. During the visits, the art group performed wherever they went, regardless of the performance conditions or the number of spectators. Large and small theaters, school classrooms, stadiums, dining halls, and even street squares were all their performance venues. Sometimes the tape recorder for playing music malfunctioned, and the accordion quickly took over, becoming the accompaniment instrument for the entire performance. After each performance, all members of the delegation worked together to clean up the props and tidy up the venue, trying not to cause trouble for the hosts. In this way, in one month last September, in addition to traveling back and forth, they performed twenty-two times in France, allowing eight or nine thousand French workers, students, citizens, and people from all walks of life, especially those who could never afford to go to a large theater, to appreciate Chinese songs and dances for the first time.
    One day, the delegation came to a university dormitory in Lyon. The hosts felt sorry that the guests had traveled from afar and there was no suitable stage. The Chinese actors told the hosts that it didn't matter, as long as there was a flat space the size of a few tables, they could perform. So, the actors immediately carried the prop box to the school's outdoor basketball court and began singing and dancing on the sandy ground. French students and some African students were deeply moved by this spirit of the Chinese youth. After the performance, many people invited the delegation members to their dormitories, inquiring about the lives of the Chinese people and information about the people's communes, and talking about their ideals and hopes for the future. They said: "From your performances, we feel the affection of Chinese friends for us and see the achievements of China's socialist construction."
    Please Leave a Chairman Mao Badge
    Nîmes is an ancient city in southern France. When the delegation visited here, they walked along the streets of the residential area, singing along with the music. When the citizens heard that the Chinese had come and were performing songs and dances, they rushed out to watch. After watching the performance, an old lady came forward and hoped that the delegation would give her a Chairman Mao badge. One of the actors in the delegation's art group immediately took off the badge on his chest and fulfilled the old woman's wish. After receiving the Chairman Mao badge, the old woman looked at it again and again, and was very happy. She hugged the actor tightly. After one performance ended, they were to move to another square, but a large group of spectators was still unwilling to leave and watched the second performance, including the old lady. The old lady said once again that she had another daughter and hoped to get another Chairman Mao badge...
    Remembering the Anti-Fascist Years
    Through these visits and performances, the friendship between the Chinese and French people was further strengthened. During the performance in Villeurbanne, the accordion player played the battle song "Song of the Partisans," which was popular among the French people during the resistance against fascist aggression. The atmosphere at the time was very warm, and many people sang along. A fascist element, squeezed in the audience, felt attacked and angrily made a fascist salute, withdrawing from the venue. At this time, the crowd was agitated, and people booed at the fleeing fellow, then turned back and applauded enthusiastically, shouting to the Chinese actors: "Thank you, thank you!" Some people said: "Your performance is good, it reminds us of the scene of fighting the fascists," and some said: "The French people must always be friendly with the Chinese people."
    Vigorous and Energetic is the Biggest Feature
    The organizers of the festival, the French National Student Union, as well as the France-China Friendship Association (Marseille) and the general audience, gave the Chinese student delegation enthusiastic support and great encouragement. They were very satisfied with the fact that the Chinese programs not only reflected the content of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, but also had beautiful national forms. They said that if the literary and artistic programs of the entire festival were to be judged, "China is the first," and "China's programs make people feel excited." A worker said: "I am very happy because I saw Chinese songs and dances on the street." An official of the French National Student Union said, "The Chinese delegation does not make harsh demands on the performance venue or conditions. They are the most humble and enthusiastic, the easiest to receive, and the most considerate of others' difficulties." Many people also said, "The Chinese delegation is the most united and has the greatest collective spirit. In order to make the performance a success, everyone works together with one heart, and no one seems to have a prominent position in the performance."
    More than a dozen national and local newspapers in France reported and commented on the Chinese literary and artistic performances, unanimously expressing praise. A newspaper in La Seyne wrote in an article entitled "From Ancient China to Modern China": "The rich culture of the Chinese people has been confirmed by the outstanding performances of the actors. The performed dances have amazing accuracy, and the male and female dancers seem to have stepped out of a rich and colorful print..." A newspaper in Grenoble pointed out in a report that the characteristic of the performances of the Chinese student delegation was "vigorous and energetic," "From the harvest of the people's commune to the Long March, all these stages of the lives of the Chinese people have been performed beautifully, lightly, and accurately." A newspaper in Lyon said, "The Chinese have brought real pleasure to the audience with their performances."
    Welcome More Literary and Art Light Cavalry
    The French public welcomes Chinese art. They not only hope to see large-scale Chinese art performances, but also like to appreciate short and concise performances. When the Chinese student delegation said goodbye to France, many French friends enthusiastically expressed their hope that China would send more small performance teams to visit France in the future. They said: "Small performance teams are easy to receive and can go to medium and small cities, so that more French people can see the performances. This is what we welcome." The art group of the Chinese student delegation went abroad and, with the attitude of a literary and art light cavalry and its unique style, went deep into the French people and met with the vast majority of ordinary French laborers, making a successful visit and performance, which was warmly welcomed. Therefore, some people in our country call them "international 'Ulanmuqi'."
    International "Ulanmuqi," may you gallop bravely on the road of international cultural exchange, and serve the Chinese people and the people of the world better and more!

    中国“乌兰牧骑”在法国
    ——中国学生代表团艺术组访法演出记
    从来没有的新鲜事
    世界名城之一的马赛市，从来也没有过这样的新鲜事：一群黄皮肤、黑头发的青年人，把广场变成舞台，开始了街头演出。一时，琴声悠扬，红绸翻舞，热闹的场面，使得周围楼房的窗口都变成了人们的看台。几场这样的演出之后，马赛市的《马赛人报》登出了一条醒目的消息，其中写道：“这是有质量的演出，中国人征服了马赛……。”
    原来，来到这个名城演出的，并不是一个队伍浩荡的“艺术团”，而是中国的一个“乌兰牧骑”式的“小班子”。它是应法国全国学联的邀请，参加一九六五年九月在马赛举行的第十三届大学生国际文化联欢节的中国学生代表团的艺术组。一共只有七个年青人
    这个艺术组包括三女四男，一共是七个年青人。一架手风琴，一部放送伴奏乐曲的录音机，几套舞衣和几件简单道具，就是全部行头。他们把这些东西收拾在一个皮箱里，随身带着它，轻轻便便地横跨欧洲到了马赛。
    友谊的联欢开始了。中国学生代表团艺术组的七个人，无论是单独演出，还是和各国学生联合演出，都演得满台是戏。雨虹、张玉娟、陈克禹、陈丽文四个团员的演出，让各国朋友看到了丰富多采的舞蹈“红绸舞”、“女民兵”、“丰收舞”、“艰苦的岁月”、“弓舞”、“牧羊女”；范永生、热比亚演唱了《大海航行靠舵手》、《草原上升起不落的太阳》、《我赶着大车跑的欢》、《红梅赞》、《冬布拉》、《火车来到了戈壁滩》；任士荣演奏了手风琴曲《回忆延安》、《扭起秧歌庆丰收》和法国的《游击队员之歌》。
    中国学生代表团的演出深深吸引了法国和其他各国的观众。不论是那一场演出，每个节目都引起了热烈的掌声，许多节目如果不重新表演，掌声怎么也不肯停息。有好几次演出结束后，观众涌向后台同中国演员握手，有些青年第二天拿着鲜花来登门祝贺，赞扬中国演员“精神饱满”，演出“充满了信心”，有的还要求学习中国的“红绸舞”和其他舞蹈。走到那里演到那里
    在联欢节期间和联欢节闭幕以后，中国学生代表团作为法国全国学联的客人，又访问了巴黎、里昂等六个大、中、小城市。在访问中，艺术组不拘演出条件好坏，不管观众有多少，到了那里，演到那里，大、小剧场，学校的教室、球场、饭厅，甚至街头广场，都是他们演出的场地。有时候放送乐曲的录音机发生故障，手风琴就很快地接了上来，成为整个演出的伴奏乐器。每场演出结束后，代表团全体成员一齐动手，收拾道具，整理场地，尽量不给主人增添麻烦。就这样，他们在去年九月一个月内，除了往返赶路以外，共在法国演出二十二场，使八、九千法国工人、学生、市民和各界人士，特别是使那些从来都上不起大剧院的人，第一次欣赏了中国的歌舞。
    有一天，代表团来到里昂的一个大学生宿舍。主人当时感到客人远道而来，没有合适的舞台，实在过意不去。中国演员向主人说，这不要紧，只要有几张桌子那么大的一块平地就可以演出。于是，演员们一下把道具箱提到学校的露天篮球场上，踏着砂土地，高歌欢舞起来。法国学生和一些非洲留学生被中国青年的这种精神深深感动了，演出结束以后，不少人把代表团团员请到宿舍里，询问中国人民生活和有关人民公社的情况，谈起他们的理想和对未来的希望。他们说：“从你们的演出里，我们感到了中国朋友对我们的感情，看到了中国社会主义建设的成就。”请留下毛主席纪念章
    尼姆是法国南部的一个古老的城市。代表团在访问这里的时候，在居民区的街道上一边走，一边伴着琴声唱了起来。市民们听说来了中国人，还表演歌舞，就争先恐后出来观看。有一位老太太看了演出后，走上前来，希望代表团赠送她一枚毛主席纪念章。代表团艺术组的一位演员当时就把自己胸前的纪念章摘下来，满足了这位老人的心愿。老人拿到毛主席纪念章后，看了又看，十分高兴，她紧紧地拥抱了那位演员。一场演出结束了，要转移到另一个广场去，可是一大群观众仍然不愿意离开，跟着又看了第二场演出，其中就有那位老太太。这位老太太又一次说，她还有一个女儿，希望再得到一枚毛主席纪念章……。想起了反法西斯的年代
    通过这些访问演出，进一步交流了中法两国人民的友情。在维兰诺罗佩演出的时候，手风琴演奏员奏了当年法国人民抵抗法西斯侵略时普遍流行的战斗歌曲《游击队员之歌》。当时场上气氛十分热烈，许多人跟着唱了起来。挤在观众中的一个法西斯分子感到受了打击，气急败坏地做了个法西斯党徒敬礼的姿态，退出场外。这时群情激动，人们朝着逃走的这个家伙发出嘘声，接着回过头来热烈鼓掌，向中国演员们高呼：“谢谢你们，谢谢你们！”有的人说：“你们的演奏好，使我们回忆起了同法西斯进行斗争的情景”，有的表示：“法国人民一定要同中国人民永远友好下去”。朝气勃勃是最大特点
    联欢节的组织者法国全国学联，以及法中友协（马赛）和广大观众，给了中国学生代表团热情的支持和很大的鼓舞。他们对中国的节目既反映了中国革命斗争的内容，又具有优美的民族形式，感到很满意。他们说，如果要评奖整个联欢节的文艺节目，“中国是头等的”，“中国的节目看了叫人感到兴奋”。一位工人说：“我很高兴，因为我在大街上就看到了中国的歌舞”。法国全国学联的一位负责人说，“中国代表团不对演出场地、演出条件提出苛刻要求，他们是最谦虚热情，最好接待，最体谅别人困难的代表团。”有不少人还说，“中国代表团是最团结、最富有集体精神的，他们为了把演出搞好，大家同心协力，看不出哪一个人在演出中占有突出的地位。”
    法国的十几家全国性和地方性的报纸，对中国的文艺演出作了报道和评论，异口同声地表示赞扬。拉赛纳的一家报纸在一篇题为《从古老的中国到现代的中国》的文章中写道：“中国人民丰富的文化，从演员杰出的表演中得到了证实，演出的舞蹈具有惊人的准确，男女舞蹈演员就好象是从一幅丰富多采的版画中走出来的……。”格勒诺贝尔的一家报纸在报道中，指出中国学生代表团演出的特点是“朝气勃勃”，“从人民公社的收割到长征，所有中国人民生活的这些阶段，都优美、轻快、精确地表演出来了”。里昂的一家报纸说，“中国人以他们的表演给观众带来了真正的乐趣”。欢迎更多的文艺轻骑兵
    法国公众欢迎中国的艺术，他们不仅希望看到中国大型的艺术表演，也愿意欣赏短小精干的演出。中国学生代表团告别法国的时候，许多法国朋友热情地表示，希望中国以后多派一些小型演出队访问法国。他们说：“小型演出队好接待，能到中、小城市去，更多的法国人能看到演出，这是我们欢迎的。”中国学生代表团艺术组走出国门，以文艺轻骑兵的姿态，以它特有的风采，深入法国民间，同广大的普通法国劳动人民会见，作了一次成功的访问演出，受到了热烈的欢迎，因此我国有人称他们是“国际上的‘乌兰牧骑’”。
    国际上的“乌兰牧骑”，愿你在国际文化交流的大道上勇敢地奔驰，更多更好地为中国人民和全世界人民服务吧！
