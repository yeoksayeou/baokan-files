    It is Both the Hai River Construction Site and a Communist School
    Two Letters, Worker-Peasant Friendship
    Comrade Cao Fuhai, of poor peasant origin. This time when he went to the construction site, he brought two pairs of shoes, one old and one new. The old ones were worn out, but he couldn't bear to use the new ones. A comrade from the repair mobile team of the Jingxian Handicraft Bureau Iron Factory, which supports the Hai River project, wrote him a letter after learning about this:
    Comrade Cao Fuhai:
    Last night, I heard that you were reluctant to wear new shoes while digging earth. I was deeply moved by your spirit of hard work. Your drive is worth learning from. I heard that you were born into a poor peasant family, and now your family of nine includes six children and your elderly mother. I can imagine that your wife is someone who loves the collective and loves labor, so she is busy with the collective and less busy with her own household chores. Therefore, she doesn't have time to make you more shoes. Thinking of this, I couldn't sleep at all last night, thinking about you and caring for you over and over again. On the battlefield of taming the Hai River, I have nothing to give you except for a pair of shoes and socks I took off my feet! When you receive these shoes and socks, don't thank me, because what I have done is far from the Party's requirements. You should thank the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao. I wish you good health, and I hope you will become a "Five-Good" soldier on the Hai River taming front.
    Your unknown comrade-in-arms, class brother, Comrade Tian:
    With tears in my eyes, I accepted the shoes and socks you gave me. I don't know what to say. The instructor only told me: "The comrades from the repair team are supporting you." I asked again and again, and only then did I learn it was you.
    I couldn't sleep at night, and I thought of many past events. In the dark old society, I begged for food from a young age. I never wore cotton clothes, shoes, or socks in the winter, and I never had a full meal. At the age of sixteen, I became a farmhand for the landlord, enduring his beatings and insults all day long. Who cared about me then? The Communist Party came, and I was liberated. I will never forget it in my lifetime, and I will pass it on to future generations.
    Comrade Tian, I will never forget your help. Only in the new society under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such class brothers. I thank you, I thank the great Communist Party, and I thank the great leader Chairman Mao.
    I have nothing else to say. I will dedicate all my strength to this Hai River taming project. I guarantee to you that I will resolutely do the work well, complete the task ahead of schedule, and vow to be a "Five-Good" migrant worker.
                Liufuying Bajiasi Village, Cao Fuhai

“I am a Migrant Worker from Cheng'an”
    It was past 9 p.m. on December 11, 1965, and a level five or six north wind was still blowing. A young migrant worker handed Commander Niu Fengming a woolen coat, along with some other items, and said, "Please give these things to class brothers in need!"
      "Which migrant worker company are you from? What's your name..." the commander asked him urgently. "I am a migrant worker from Cheng'an!" the young man replied decisively, put the things on the table, turned around, and walked out.
    "Comrade! You..." Commander Niu chased him to the door, a tall figure walking against the cold wind....

  Two Buttons Warm Hearts
    The salesman from the Gecun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hengshui County came to the construction site of the Zhangxiutun camp on the Suo'alu River. The comrades of the catering squad wanted to buy buttons. The salesman knew that the buttons he brought were sold out, so he tore off two buttons from his own clothes and sewed them on for the cook. When the cook asked how much they cost, the salesman refused to take any money. The cook was very moved, but the salesman said, "I am far from being as good as Comrade Wang Jie!" He refused to leave his name and left the construction site.
                        [Zaoqiang County Construction Site]
      People from All Over the Country are One Family
    After we migrant workers arrived at the construction site, we lived in shacks. One night in November, it suddenly started to rain. An old man, Shi Dabo, a poor peasant from Liuwumen Village, whose family of nine lived in three rooms, voluntarily vacated two rooms for us to live in. We really felt bad about this and felt sorry for them. When Shi Dabo's wife heard this, she said, "What does this count for? Our whole family of nine relies on the state. I still feel sorry for the state for doing this." The next day after we went to our section, the old landlady was afraid that we would be cold, so she took off the door curtain she had hanging and hung it up for us, and she also pasted paper on the windows for us. Every time after we finished our section, the old landlady would heat up a pot of water in advance for us to wash our faces and feet. When she saw that our clothes were dirty, she would wash them for us. When she saw that our shoes were broken, she would take out rope and thread to mend and sew them for us. Our entire platoon expressed our determination to the leaders and to the landlords: We must contribute all our strength to the Hai River taming project.

    是海河工地也是共产主义的学校
    两封书信　工农情谊
    曹福海同志，贫农出身。这次他到工地带了两双鞋，一旧一新。旧的穿坏了，新的舍不得用。景县手工业局铁厂支持海河工程修配流动组的一位同志知道后，给他写了一封信：曹福海同志：
    昨天晚上，我听说你舍不得穿新鞋挖土。你这种刻苦的精神，我听了非常感动。象你这样的干劲，是值得我们学习的。我听说你出身是个贫农，现在全家九口人，有六个孩子和老母亲，可想而知你的爱人是一个热爱集体，热爱劳动的人，多忙于集体、少忙于自己的家务，因此，顾不上给你多做鞋。想到这些，今天晚上我怎么也睡不下去，翻来复去地体贴您、关心您。在根治海河的战场上，我没有什么东西给你，只有从脚上脱下来的一双鞋、一双袜子给你吧！当你收到这双鞋、袜的时候，不要感谢我，因为我做的事离党的要求还差得很远。要感谢伟大的党，伟大的领袖毛主席。祝你身体健康，望你在根治海河战线上成为五好战士。
    你的面不相识的战友，阶级兄弟。田同志：
    我两眼含着热泪，接过你送给我的鞋和袜，我不知说什么好。教导员只给我说：“是修配组的同志支援你的”。我问了又问，才知道是你。
    我晚上睡不着觉，我想起了很多往事。在黑暗的旧社会里，我从小要饭讨生，冬天没穿过棉衣和鞋袜，一顿饱饭没吃过。在十六岁那年就给地主当上了长工，整天受地主的打骂和侮辱，那时谁来管我呢？共产党来了，我才翻了身，我一辈子也不会忘记，我要代代传下去。
    田同志，你对我的帮助，我永远不会忘记，只有在共产党领导下的新社会才有这样的阶级兄弟。我感谢你，我感谢伟大的共产党，感谢伟大的领袖毛主席。
    我没有别的话可说，我要在这次根治海河工程中，拿出全身的力量，我向你保证，坚决把活做好，提前完成任务，誓做五好民工。
                留府营巴家寺村　曹福海“我是成安一民工”
    一九六五年十二月十一日深夜九点多钟了，五六级北风还在刮着，一个青年民工递给牛凤鸣指挥长一件绒衣，还有其他一些东西，说：“请把这些东西交给有困难的阶级弟兄用吧！”
      “你是哪个民工连的？叫什么名字……”指挥长紧问了他一句。“我是成安一民工！”这青年果断地回答了一句，把东西放到桌上，扭头就往外走了。
    “同志！你……”牛指挥长紧追到门外，一个高大的人影迎着寒风走去……。
                  〔成安县工地〕
  两个扣子暖人心
    衡水县戈村供销社售货员来到索芦河张秀屯营的工地上。炊事班的同志要买扣子，售货员知道带来的扣子卖完了，随手撕下了自己身上的两个扣子，给炊事员缀上了。当炊事员问多少钱时，售货员说什么也不要钱，炊事员很受感动，售货员却说：“咱和王杰同志比还差的远哩！”他不肯把自己名字留下，就离开了工地。
                        〔枣强县工地〕
      山南海北一家人
    我们民工到达工地之后，住的是工棚。在十一月的一天夜里，忽然下起了小雨，有刘五门村的一位房东时大伯，贫农成分，全家九口人有三间房子，自动腾出两间来让我们居住。这样真使我们心中不忍，觉得对不起人家。这话被时大伯的爱人听见了，她说：“这算得了什么，俺全家九口人都是依靠国家的，这样做我还觉得对不起国家呢。”第二天我们上段之后，房东老大娘怕我们冷，把自己挂着的门帘摘下来给我们挂上，还把窗户给我们糊上。每逢我们下段之后，房东大娘都提前给我们烧热一锅水，让我们洗脸洗脚。见到我们衣服脏了就给洗了，见到我们的鞋破了，就拿出绳线给我们补鞋、缝鞋。我们全排向领导、向房东表示决心：一定要在根治海河的工程中，贡献我们的全部力量。
