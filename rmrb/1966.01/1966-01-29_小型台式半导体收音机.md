    Small Desktop Transistor Radio
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 25th – At the start of the year, workers at the Nanjing Radio Factory immediately launched their first production effort, successfully creating a small desktop transistor radio. The design and trial production of this product took half the time compared to designing and trial-producing similar products in the past.
    This B611 desktop transistor radio has a very beautiful design. Its size is about the same as a large stainless steel lunchbox, and it has high sensitivity, capable of receiving more than thirty radio stations. The sound is loud and clear, and the cost is also low. Its creation adds a new model to China's radio receivers.
