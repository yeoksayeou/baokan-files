    嘴里讲的和心里想的
      群众批评我们“嘴讲面向农村，心里向着城镇”，干部是“公家人，有些
  事做得并不公”。大家听了都说群众意见“千金难买”
    Socialist education movement began after the masses of poor and lower-middle peasants put forward many criticisms to us. They said that we talk about facing the countryside but our hearts are toward the cities. This criticism sharply pointed out where the problem lies. However, some county committee leading cadres excused themselves by saying: "The countryside is vast, with many strands, it is difficult for one person to satisfy everyone, it is inevitable that there will be opinions." Although we mobilized the masses to put forward a barrage of opinions, most of them were directed towards the departments, and few were directed towards the county committee leaders, so the problem could not be revealed deeply and thoroughly. (Editor's note: Yes, we cannot be careless at this critical juncture. Whether the county committee has ideological leadership depends on this move.)
    Where is the root of the problem? We launched criticism and self-criticism among the Standing Committee members of the county committee, examined our thinking in light of Chairman Mao's works, and everyone realized that the responsibility does not lie entirely with the departments, but with the county committee leadership. The county committee did not use the viewpoint of class struggle and class analysis to guide the work of the departments, and did not realize that "facing the countryside" is a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.
    The county committee took timely and active measures to further mobilize the masses, carry out the struggle between two ideologies and two work styles, and took the lead in making self-criticisms at the three-level cadre meetings and the poor and lower-middle peasant representative congresses. The vast number of cadres and the masses saw that the county committee was determined to rectify and were also willing to put forward opinions and expose problems. The masses criticized us saying: "You are doing rural work, but you are not of one heart and mind with us, you have forgotten Chairman Mao's words." "You are public servants, but some things you do are not fair." Hearing these criticisms from the masses, everyone felt warm in their hearts and said it was "education that money cannot buy." (Editor's note: Like the Quan Jiao County Committee, open the window of thought, let the fresh wind from the masses blow, and the mind will be clearer.)
    The fundamental reason why the work was not done well was that we deviated from Mao Zedong Thought. We took the exposed problems and re-studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Economic Problems and Financial Problems during the Anti-Japanese War," and "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods," and organized all walks of life to study policies. Everyone realized that 95 percent of our work objects are rural areas, and 95 percent are farmers, and serving 500 million farmers by facing the countryside is the starting point for all work.
    After the ideological problem was solved, the county committee immediately used revolutionary methods to carry out rectification measures centered on streamlining administration. Most of the county committee Standing Committee members went down to stay at selected points to create model examples. Leading cadres from various departments and industries also went out of their offices to stay at selected points in the countryside to create model examples, actively implementing the work at the production team level, and the road became wider and wider.
    The struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in the countryside is only the beginning, and the county committee must carry out this struggle to the end.

    嘴里讲的和心里想的
      群众批评我们“嘴讲面向农村，心里向着城镇”，干部是“公家人，有些
  事做得并不公”。大家听了都说群众意见“千金难买”
    社会主义教育运动开始后，广大贫下中农向我们提出了许多批评。他们说我们是嘴讲面向农村，心里向着城镇。这个批评一针见血地点破了问题的所在。但有的县委领导干部原谅自己说：“农村范围广，头绪多，一人难中百人意，难免有意见”。我们虽然发动群众提了一通意见，但是对各部门提得多，对县委领导提得少，问题不能揭深揭透。（编者按：对，在这节骨眼上不能掉以轻心，县委有无思想领导，就看此一着。）
    问题的根子在那里？我们县委常委之间开展了批评与自我批评，对照主席著作检查了思想，大家认识到，责任不全在各部门，而是在县委领导，县委没有用阶级斗争和阶级分析的观点来指导各部门的工作，没有认识到“面向农村”是一场兴无灭资的斗争。
    县委及时采取积极措施，进一步发动群众，开展两种思想两种作风的斗争，并带头在三级干部会和贫下中农代表大会上作检查。广大干部和群众看到县委整改决心大，也敢于提意见，揭问题。群众批评我们说：“你们做的是农村工作，却没有同我们心连心，你们忘记了毛主席的话。”“你们是公家人，可是有些事做得并不公”。听到群众这些批评，大家心坎里热呼呼的，都说是“千金难买的教育”。（编者按：象全椒县委这样，打开思想的窗户，吹吹从群众中来的清风，头脑就更清醒了。）
    工作没有做好的根本原因，是离开了毛主席思想。我们就带着揭发出来的问题，重新学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，并组织各行各业学习政策。大家才认识到：我们的工作对象，百分之九十五是农村，百分之九十五是农民，面向农村为五亿农民服务，是一切工作的出发点。
    思想问题解决后，县委紧接着用革命的办法，开展了以精兵简政为中心的整改措施。多数县委常委都下去蹲点搞样板。各部门各行业的领导干部也纷纷走出办公室，到农村蹲点，搞样板，主动地把工作落实到生产队，路子也越走越宽了。
    面向农村这场兴无灭资的斗争，仅仅是开始，县委一定要把这场斗争进行到底。
