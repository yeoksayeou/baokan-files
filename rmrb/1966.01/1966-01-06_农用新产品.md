    New Agricultural Products
    Batch Production of "Leap Forward Brand" Tractors
    The twenty-horsepower "Leap Forward Brand" tractors, newly manufactured in Shanxi Province, are now being produced in batches.

    This tractor was made by the Yuncheng Tractor Factory in Shanxi Province in collaboration with thirteen local state-owned machinery factories. It can cultivate large tracts of dry land on plains and is even more suitable for cultivating small plots of land in hilly and semi-mountainous areas. It can also be used as a means of transportation or to drive agricultural and sideline product processing machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery. On average, it can cultivate about five mu of land per hour and is of good quality.
  
  Shenyang Manufactures Agricultural Self-Priming Centrifugal Pump
    A self-priming centrifugal pump that is easy for farmers to use has recently been manufactured at the Shenyang Water Pump Factory.

    This pump can automatically discharge the air from the suction pipe and then quickly draw water. Except for the first time it is used, when a small amount of water needs to be poured into the pump body, it does not need to be filled with water each time it is started. Ordinary water pumps must have the suction pipe filled with water before each start-up in order to draw water.

    This self-priming centrifugal pump is made by improving the shape of the impeller and the water inlet of an ordinary water pump. The structure is not more complex than an ordinary water pump, and it consumes less metal material during manufacturing than an ordinary water pump.
  
  Hulan County Manufactures Soybean Seed Selector
    A soybean seed selector that does not require machine power or manual shaking has been manufactured in Heilongjiang Province.

    This seed selector is very convenient to use. Two people take turns pouring soybeans into the funnel, and the soybeans can be divided into three grades of good and substandard seeds through a spiral chute. It can select six hundred to seven hundred jin of soybeans per hour, which is equivalent to the labor of ninety people selecting seeds manually for one day.

    The seed selector has a simple structure with two rotating chutes inside. After the soybeans are poured in from the upper funnel, the soybean seeds automatically slide into a specially made device due to the different inertial forces during the rotation process, and then the soybean seeds of different grades are separated.

    This seed selector was successfully trial-produced by the staff of the Hulan County Machinery Repair Cooperative.

    In the past, farmers in Hulan County used manual selection to sell first-class soybeans to the state, which was very inefficient and could not guarantee quality. Last year, due to the widespread use of this soybean seed selector in the people's communes and production teams, the county quickly and well completed the task of selling soybeans to the state ahead of schedule.

    农用新产品
    “跃进牌”拖拉机成批生产
    山西新制成的二十马力“跃进牌”拖拉机，现在已经成批生产。
    这种拖拉机是山西省运城拖拉机厂跟十三家地方国营机械厂共同协作制成的。它能在平川大片旱地上耕作，更适合在丘陵和半山区的小块土地上耕作，而且还能用来作运输工具，或用来带动农副产品加工机械和排灌机械。它平均每小时能耕地约五亩，而且质量好。
  沈阳制成农用自吸离心泵
    便于农民使用的自吸离心泵最近在沈阳水泵厂制成。
    这种水泵能自动排出吸水管的空气，然后很快把水抽上来。除了头一次使用的时候需要往泵体里灌少量水之外，以后每次开动就不需要再灌水了。而普通的水泵，每次开动前都得先把水泵吸水管灌满水，然后才能把水吸上来。
    这种自吸离心泵，是把普通水泵的叶轮形状和进水口加以改进而成的，结构不比普通的水泵复杂，制造时耗用的金属材料也比普通水泵少。
  呼兰县制成大豆选粒器
    黑龙江省制成了一种不用机器动力也不用人摇的大豆选粒器。
    这种选粒器使用起来很灵便，两个人轮流把大豆倒进漏斗，大豆就可以通过螺旋式的滑道，按好次籽粒分成三等。它每小时可以选大豆六百斤到七百斤，相当于九十个人手工选粒一天的劳动量。
    这种选粒器构造简单，里边有两圈旋转式滑道，大豆从上面漏斗倒进以后，由于旋转过程中的不同惯力的作用，豆粒自动滑落到特制的装置里，然后分出不同等级的豆粒来。
    这种选粒器是呼兰县机械修配合作社的职工试制成功的。
    过去，呼兰县农民为了向国家交售一等大豆，都是采用手工挑选的办法，效率很低，同时还不能保证质量。去年，由于各人民公社生产队普遍用上了这种大豆选粒器，全县又快又好地提前完成了向国家交售大豆的任务。
