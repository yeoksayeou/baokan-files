    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia delivered a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th, lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government against the rampant anti-China activities carried out by Indonesian right-wing forces since January 10th.
    The note stated that since January 10th, Indonesian right-wing forces have engaged in rampant anti-China activities during demonstrations in Jakarta. On January 10th and 15th, thousands of people organized by right-wing forces went to the gate of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta three times, carrying out provocations and shouting anti-China slogans. On the 15th, several hundred people organized by right-wing forces again went to the gate of the Chinese Embassy in trucks and other vehicles, carrying out the same provocations. The slogans they shouted included: "Down with the People's Republic of China," "Drive out the People's Republic of China," "Drive out the Chinks," "Hang the Chinks," "Down with Radio Beijing," and so on. They also painted provocative slogans on the walls of the embassy and wrote and pasted anti-China slogans on the embassy and consulate general's vehicles. It was also discovered that they carried banners and flags insulting the People's Republic of China during the parade and painted such slogans on vehicles. They yelled anti-China slogans and made threats to embassy personnel on official business and made threatening phone calls to the embassy. They also wantonly slandered Radio Beijing, smeared the New China News Agency, and clamored to expel Xinhua News Agency reporters. They also incited persecution of overseas Chinese. At the same time, Indonesian right-wing newspapers echoed and cooperated, attacking China wildly, inciting anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiments, and clamoring for severing diplomatic relations with China.
    The note pointed out that these anti-China activities carried out by Indonesian right-wing forces under the instigation of imperialism are another blatant provocation against the Chinese people, seriously insulting China's national dignity and further poisoning the relations between China and Indonesia. In this regard, the Chinese Embassy lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government.
    The note stated: For several months, despite the series of serious anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents created by Indonesian right-wing forces, the Chinese government has always adopted a restrained attitude and made various efforts to safeguard the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. Although the Indonesian government has repeatedly stated that it will take measures to stop the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of Indonesian right-wing forces, these activities have not only not stopped but have become increasingly blatant and arrogant. This shows that the Indonesian government has not fulfilled its promises. This cannot but be a matter of great regret.
    The note once again requested the Indonesian government to take practical and effective measures to stop the various anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of Indonesian right-wing forces, stop all rumors and slanders against China, ensure the safety of the Chinese Embassy, consulates, the Jakarta branch of the Xinhua News Agency and other institutions and their personnel, and protect the legitimate rights and the safety of life and property of overseas Chinese.

    我国大使馆照会印度尼西亚政府
    最强烈抗议印度尼西亚右派反华排华
    严正指出：一月十日以来，印度尼西亚右派在帝国主义唆使下进行的反华活动，是对中国人民的又一次猖狂挑衅，进一步毒化了两国关系。
    新华社十九日讯　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十七日把一份照会交给印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚右派势力在一月十日以来猖狂进行反华活动，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会说，自一月十日以来，印度尼西亚右派势力在雅加达举行的示威游行中，进行了猖狂的反华活动。一月十日、十五日两日，前后有右派势力组织的数以千计的人，曾经三次到中国驻雅加达总领事馆门前，进行了挑衅，高呼反华口号。十五日，又有右派势力组织的数百人，分乘卡车和其它车辆，到中国大使馆门前进行了同样的挑衅。他们叫喊的口号有：“打倒中华人民共和国”，“赶走中华人民共和国”，“赶走支那人”，“吊死支那人”，“打倒北京电台”等等。他们还在大使馆的墙壁上涂写挑衅标语，在大使馆、总领事馆的汽车上涂写和张贴反华标语。也发现他们在游行中还携带侮辱中华人民共和国的标语、旗帜，且将这类标语涂写于车辆上。他们对大使馆因公外出的人员狂叫反华口号，进行威胁，对大使馆打恫吓性的电话。他们还肆意诽谤北京电台，诬蔑新华通讯社，并叫嚣要驱逐新华社记者。他们还煽动迫害华侨。与此同时，印度尼西亚右派报纸也呼应配合，对中国大肆攻击，鼓动反华排华，叫嚣要同中国断交。
    照会指出，印度尼西亚右派势力在帝国主义唆使下进行的这些反华活动，是对中国人民的又一次猖狂挑衅，严重侮辱了中国的国家尊严，进一步毒化了中国和印度尼西亚两国关系。对此，中国大使馆向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会说：几个月来，尽管印度尼西亚右派势力制造了一系列严重的反华排华事件，中国政府一直采取克制的态度，并且做出种种努力，以维护中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的友谊。印度尼西亚政府虽然一再表示要采取措施，制止印度尼西亚右派势力的反华排华活动，但是，这种活动不但没有停止，反而越来越放肆，越来越嚣张。这说明印度尼西亚政府并没有履行自己的诺言。这不能不令人感到极大的遗憾。
    照会再一次要求印度尼西亚政府采取切实有效的措施，制止印度尼西亚右派势力的各种反华排华活动，停止对中国的一切造谣诽谤，保障中国大使馆、领事馆、新华通讯社驻雅加达分社等机构及其人员的安全，保护华侨的正当权益和生命财产的安全。
