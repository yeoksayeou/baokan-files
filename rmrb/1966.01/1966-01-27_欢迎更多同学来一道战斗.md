    Welcome More Classmates to Join the Fight
    We have been working in the green treasure trove of the motherland's north – the Greater Khingan Mountains – for more than three months, far away from our alma mater and hometown. Although the work here is very intense, we are spiritually very happy. We have deeply fallen in love with our work and deeply fallen in love with this beautiful and rich Greater Khingan Mountains.
    Because there is a great need for electrical technology personnel here, we started our intense work as soon as we arrived. In the past three months, we have traveled all over most of the Xing'anling area. Some have participated in electrical installation, fighting on the hot construction sites. Some have participated in the preliminary survey work of the 60,000-volt high-voltage transmission lines, climbing high mountains, crossing dense forests, and fighting in the forest and snow plains. Now, we have accepted several design tasks for urban distribution lines and started a new battle.
    We lack experience, lack data, and lack the guidance of experienced comrades. Much of the work is unfamiliar and must be explored by ourselves. There are many difficulties, but difficulties do not frighten us. When we encounter difficulties, we study Chairman Mao's works and draw spiritual strength from them. After listening to Chairman Mao's words, we continuously overcome one difficulty after another and complete the various glorious tasks assigned to us by the leadership. Indeed, difficulties are not only training us, making us constantly grow, but also constantly testing us, seeing if we dare to take on heavy burdens, seeing if we have revolutionary ambition. In work, in the struggle against difficulties, we feel happiness. We are infinitely proud to be able to participate in the construction of the motherland's border areas and use the knowledge we have learned and the sweat of our labor to realize the electrification of the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area as soon as possible, making the beautiful Greater Khingan Mountains even more beautiful.
    The weather here is cold, and it is already forty-eight degrees below zero Celsius. However, cold is just a paper tiger, it looks scary, but it's actually nothing great. None of us have been frightened by it. We work and live very well, and now our bodies are healthier and stronger than before. Neither the harsh climate nor the difficult living conditions can conquer us; it can only be conquered by us!
    We also deeply know that our work is only the beginning, and the tasks ahead of us will be more arduous and the difficulties will be even greater. In the future, we must study Chairman Mao's works even harder, learn from Comrade Wang Jie's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, work hard, overcome all difficulties, work diligently and conscientiously, and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party. We will never let down the Party's cultivation and expectations and will dedicate our youth unreservedly to the construction of the motherland's border areas. There is a great need for electrical construction personnel here. We warmly welcome more classmates to come here and join us in fighting shoulder to shoulder!

    欢迎更多同学来一道战斗
    我们远离母校，远离家乡，来到祖国北方绿色的宝库——大兴安岭工作已有三个多月了。这儿工作虽然很紧张，但是我们精神上却十分愉快。我们已经深深地爱上了自己的工作，也深深地爱上了这美丽而富饶的大兴安岭。
    由于这儿很需要电力技术人材，我们一到这儿就开始了紧张的工作。三个多月来，我们跑遍了大半个兴安岭地区，有人参加了电气安装，战斗在火热的工地上。有人参加了六万伏高压送电线路的初勘工作，翻高山，穿密林，战斗在林海雪原之中。现在，我们又接受了几个城镇配电线路的设计任务，开始了新的战斗。
    我们没有经验，缺少资料，也缺少有经验的同志的指导，许多工作是陌生的，都要靠我们自己去摸索。困难是很多的，但是困难吓不倒我们，有了困难，我们就学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中汲取精神力量。听了毛主席的话，我们不断地战胜一个又一个的困难，完成了领导交给我们的各项光荣任务。的确，困难不仅在锻炼着我们，使我们不断地成长，而且也在时时地考验着我们，看我们敢不敢挑重担子，看我们有没有革命的志气。在工作中，在与困难作斗争中，我们感到了幸福。我们为自己能够参加祖国边疆的建设，用学得的知识和自己劳动的汗水，使大兴安岭林区早日实现电气化，把美丽的大兴安岭变得更加美丽而感到无限的自豪。
    这儿的天气是寒冷的，现在已经是摄氏零下四十八度的严寒了。但是，寒冷不过是只纸老虎，看起来可怕，其实没啥了不起。我们谁也没有被它吓倒，我们工作、生活得都很好，现在身体比以前更健康、更结实了。不论是严寒的气候，还是艰苦的生活条件，都不能征服我们，它只有被我们征服！
    我们也深深地知道：我们的工作仅仅是开始，摆在我们前面的任务会更艰巨，困难也会更多。今后，我们一定要更加努力地学习毛主席著作，学习王杰同志一心为革命的精神，艰苦奋斗，排除万难，踏踏实实，勤勤恳恳地工作，完成党交给我们的任务。我们决不辜负党的培养和期望，要把我们的青春毫无保留地献给祖国边疆的建设事业。这儿需要大量的电力建设人材，我们热情地欢迎更多的同学到这儿来和我们一道并肩战斗！
