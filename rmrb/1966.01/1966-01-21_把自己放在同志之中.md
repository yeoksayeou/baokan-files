    Putting Myself Among Comrades
    I am a “new comrade” among the county party secretaries. I only started working after liberation, and four years ago I was the Party Secretary of Baidi Commune in this county. Last year in the second half of the year, I was promoted from Head of the Propaganda Department to Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee. At the beginning, I thought: many comrades at the county and commune levels are my old superiors and old colleagues, with more seniority than me, longer Party membership, and higher cultural and political levels. Will I be able to maintain good relations with them in the future?
    I studied Chairman Mao’s articles such as "Serve the People" and "On Protracted War" with this question in mind, and finally found the correct way to deal with it. Chairman Mao taught us: “Many people cannot manage the relationship between officers and soldiers, or between the military and the people, and think that the method is incorrect. I always tell them that it is a matter of fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose). This attitude is to respect the soldiers and respect the people. Starting from this attitude, there are various policies, methods, and ways. Without this attitude, the policies, methods, and ways must be wrong, and the relationship between officers and soldiers, and between the military and the people, will definitely not be good.” I firmly remembered these teachings.
    Last autumn, I worked with some old colleagues in a grass-roots unit. I always put myself among the comrades, and did not think that because my position was now higher than theirs, I should become arrogant. Instead, I respected them and learned from their strengths. I did more work and traveled more roads. When I didn't understand something, I humbly asked for advice. When handling problems, I consulted their opinions more often. When problems occurred in the work, I did not make reckless accusations, but always analyzed the reasons and looked for solutions together with them. Everyone got along very well and were closely united with each other. I deeply felt that those past worries were completely unnecessary, and those old superiors and old colleagues all cared for me and were concerned about me. The problem is that I must respect comrades, learn humbly, and adhere to principles. In this way, the revolutionary team can be passed on well!

### 把自己放在同志之中

    把自己放在同志之中
    我在县委书记中是个“新同志”。解放后才参加工作，四年前还是本县白地公社的党委书记，去年下半年才由宣传部长提拔为县委副书记。开始，我这样想：县社两级有许多同志是我的老上级、老同事，资格比自己老，党龄比自己长，文化水平、政治水平比自己高，今后关系能不能搞好呢？
    我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《论持久战》等文章，终于找到了正确处理的办法。毛主席教导我们说：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。从这态度出发，于是有各种的政策、方法、方式。离了这态度，政策、方法、方式也一定是错的，官兵之间、军民之间的关系便决然弄不好。”我牢牢记住了这些教导。
    去年秋天，我和一些老同事在一个基层单位搞工作，我始终把自己放在同志之中，并不认为现在职务比他们高了，就骄傲起来，而是尊重他们，学习他们的长处。工作多干一些，路多跑一些。不懂的事，虚心求教。处理问题，多征求他们的意见。工作发生问题时，不乱加指责，总是和他们一道分析原因，寻找解决的办法。大家相处得很好，彼此亲密团结。我深深感到，过去那些担心完全是多余的，那些老上级、老同事，都很爱护我，关心我。问题在于自己要尊重同志，虚心学习，坚持原则，这样，革命的班子就能接得好！
