    According to Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, January 3rd: The Colombian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, *Revolución*, recently published an article warmly praising the Chinese people for providing a series of valuable experiences for the world revolution in seizing power through armed struggle, adhering to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and continuing the revolution, and for making China a great socialist country.

    The article pointed out that "all true revolutionaries must learn from the precious Chinese experience," and that "concentrating these experiences is Comrade Mao Zedong, the founder of the Party."

    The article said that people should angrily reject the revisionists' slanders against "the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party, who stand at the forefront of supporting the liberation struggles of the people of all countries."

    This article celebrating the 16th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, at the beginning, reviewed the "arduous, long-term, bloody struggle" experienced by the Chinese people before seizing power. The article pointed out that "the Chinese Communist Party stood at the forefront of the Chinese people's struggle from its very inception, thereby ensuring that the Chinese people embarked on the road to victory."

    The article focused on Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on establishing the Party's absolute leadership over the People's Army and implementing the three major democracies—military, political, and economic—in the People's Army, as well as his revolutionary theory of establishing revolutionary base areas and encircling the cities from the countryside for a protracted struggle based on his in-depth observation and investigation of Chinese society. The article pointed out, "These are the greatest achievements of the Chinese revolution, and it was by relying on these achievements that victory was achieved in this great country." The article concluded, "The Colombian Communist Party greatly needs this experience and these lessons; with its help, we can estimate and understand how the Colombian revolution failed in thirty-five years; how and why it is necessary to constantly wage struggles against right and 'left' tendencies, especially right tendencies."

    The article further pointed out that after finding the correct line, the Chinese people and the Party, through heroic sacrifice, went on to achieve the great victories of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, "writing great chapters."

    In praising the great achievements made by the new China in industry, agriculture, and science and technology, the article pointed out, "Socialism will not arise spontaneously; it is necessary to correctly apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to build socialism. To build socialism, it is necessary to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat."

    The article said, "We Marxists-Leninists, true communists, should humbly accept the teachings of the Chinese people, and help them achieve their great tasks through our resolute support for the liberation struggles of the people of all countries."

    哥伦比亚共产党（马列主义者）机关报赞扬中国成就
    中国革命为世界革命提供了宝贵经验
    人们应该愤怒地摒斥修正主义者对中国的诽谤
    据新华社三日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《革命报》不久前发表文章，热烈赞扬中国人民在通过武装斗争夺取政权、坚持无产阶级专政、不断革命等方面为世界革命提供了一系列宝贵经验，并使中国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    文章指出，“所有真正的革命者都必须学习珍贵的中国经验”，而“集中这些经验的是党的缔造者——毛泽东同志”。
    文章说，人们应该愤怒地摒斥修正主义者对“站在声援世界各国人民解放斗争最前列的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党的诽谤”。
    这篇庆贺中华人民共和国成立十六周年的文章，在一开始的时候回顾了中国人民在取得政权前所经历的“艰巨的、长期的、浴血的斗争”。文章指出，“中国共产党从它一出现就站在中国人民的前列进行斗争，从而保证中国人民走上了胜利的道路。”
    文章着重谈到了毛泽东同志关于建立党对人民军队的绝对领导和在人民军队中实行军事、政治、经济三大民主的建军思想，以及根据他对中国社会的深入观察和调查而提出的建立革命根据地、农村包围城市进行长期斗争的革命理论。文章指出，“这些都是中国革命最伟大的成就，依靠这些成就，才得以在这个大国取得胜利。”文章得出结论说，“哥伦比亚共产党很需要这种经验教训，在它的帮助下，我们可以估计和了解哥伦比亚革命在三十五年中是如何失败的；如何和为什么必须不断进行反对右的和
  ‘左’的倾向，特别是右的倾向的斗争。”
    文章又指出，中国人民和党在找到正确的路线后，通过英勇牺牲，接着又取得了抗日战争和人民解放战争的伟大胜利，“写下了伟大的篇章”。
    文章在赞扬新中国在工农业和科学技术方面取得的伟大成就时指出，“社会主义不会自发产生，必须正确地运用马克思列宁主义理论来建设社会主义。要建设社会主义必须建立无产阶级专政”。
    文章说，“我们马克思列宁主义者、真正的共产党人应该谦虚地接受中国人民的教益，通过我们对各国人民解放斗争的坚决支持帮助他们实现伟大的任务。”
