    The "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" That Distorts History
    Shi Jun
    Comrade Wu Han, in his "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" listed many historical materials to prove that the creation of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was based on historical facts. His mistake was merely that he "overly highlighted and elevated Hai Rui's image," leading readers and viewers to believe that Hai Rui was "for the people." Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism is extremely insincere and superficial, requiring continued debate with him until right and wrong are thoroughly distinguished.
    Here, I will only offer some views from the perspective of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" distorting history.
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Distorts the True Picture of Class Struggle
    Historically, the activities of any figure are constrained by class, class contradictions, and class struggle, reflecting their class and tendencies. Historical dramas must not only typically reflect the activities of historical figures but also place them in the typical environment of specific class contradictions and class struggles for portrayal.
    Hai Rui served as the Yingtian Governor during the third and fourth years of the Longqing reign of the Ming Dynasty (1569-1570). At that time, due to the large-scale annexation of land and exploitation of the people by the landlord class in the rural areas of Jiangnan since the Jiajing era, a large number of peasants were forced to flee. In the year he took office as governor, the areas of Su, Song, Chang, and Zhen suffered severe flooding, with tens of thousands of starving people. This situation not only caused serious difficulties for the economic income of the feudal regime but also aroused continuous resistance from the people. This caused considerable worry for feudal ruling-class officials like Hai Rui, who had more foresight. Therefore, as soon as he took office, he emphasized training soldiers and strengthening precautions against the peasants. On the other hand, he organized laborers to dredge the Wusong River and the Baimao River to "restore water conservancy," "provide relief to the famine-stricken people," and "pacify the people to avert unrest." Facing such an acute situation of class struggle, Hai Rui was able to implement some so-called "promoting benefits and eliminating abuses" measures within his authority, which was precisely the result of the long-term struggle of the peasant class. From the perspective of the feudal ruling class, it was to eliminate the increasingly high tide of peasant resistance. However, Comrade Wu Han, in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," concealed the actual content of the class struggle in Jiangnan at that time. In his "self-criticism," he even emphasized that in Su and Song, "the class contradiction in this region was the contradiction between peasants and local officials, not generally between peasants and landlords; the class struggle in this region was the class struggle of peasants against local officials." This excludes Hai Rui from the class opposed to the peasants, reversing Hai Rui, who was in a position of exploitation and rule in class contradiction, into a hero standing on the side of the exploited and oppressed peasant class, fighting for the interests of the peasant class. He not only blurred the class essence of the "upright official" Hai Rui but also obliterated the basic fact in historical development that "the main contradiction in feudal society is the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class."
    Although "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" depicts the suffering of the Hong Alan family, since Comrade Wu Han obliterated the basic contradiction at that time, it was impossible for him to propose a fundamental solution to the contradiction. The method he proposed to solve this contradiction was simply to have the peasants rely on the "upright official lord" to "make decisions for the people." Since the "upright official" is the dominant aspect in solving the contradiction, the plot of the poor peasants being persecuted in this play becomes a background to the dramatic conflict, with the purpose of highlighting Hai Rui, the "savior" of the peasants. There is a reason why the peasants who appear in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are written by the author to be submissive characters who only know how to kowtow and appeal to the "blue-sky lord," and only know how to say words like "gratitude" and "worship day and night."
    In feudal society, due to the limitations of historical conditions and the influence of ruling-class ideology, some people in the peasant class would have certain illusions about the feudal ruling class, especially "upright officials." However, as a class, the peasants, who have long been in a position of oppression and exploitation, are bound to generate thoughts and actions to resist the feudal ruling class. The era in which Hai Rui lived was precisely the time when the peasant class was accumulating hatred and brewing large-scale resistance struggles. The class struggle in the Su and Song areas had already shown a tense situation. Shortly after Hai Rui left office, tens of thousands of people from three counties in Huating, Songjiang, swarmed and ransacked the home of the tyrannical landlord Dong Qichang①. Where were the peasants here a group of passive and inactive "rabble" like those written by Comrade Wu Han? Isn't Comrade Wu Han's vigorous rendering of the peasants' illusion of the "upright officials" of the feudal ruling class in this play a reproduction of the erroneous view that Marx and Engels once criticized, that "the peasants demand of the aristocracy only the elimination of the abuse of power, not the elimination of the system itself"②?
    Did Hai Rui "Collide with the Foundation of the Landlord Regime and Autocratic Politics"?
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" chooses the internal contradictions of the ruling class to structure the main dramatic conflict, which is not impossible. The problem lies in the fact that Comrade Wu Han fundamentally obliterates the revolutionary spirit of the peasant class in history and mistakenly portrays the "upright official" Hai Rui as a hero who stands on the side of the peasants and fights for the interests of the peasants throughout his life. Therefore, in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," the internal contradiction struggle of the feudal ruling class is also distorted.
    History tells us that within the feudal ruling class, due to the conflict of interests between different groups and their different understandings of the situation of class struggle, differences often arise in how to maintain and consolidate the dynasty's rule and how to formulate and implement specific policies to exploit the peasants. This is especially true during the declining period of a dynasty. At this time, some internal "opposition" figures will also appear, criticizing the government from the overall and long-term interests of the ruling class, and even offering advice and accusations to the supreme ruler—the emperor. This kind of struggle is sometimes very fierce. Hai Rui once risked his life to speak frankly, submitting the "Petition for Peace" to Emperor Jiajing; he also bluntly scolded the "evil and slanderous officials" who were famous for a time; later, once he was honorably appointed as the Yingtian Governor, he "took himself as a model" and implemented a set of measures to suppress the powerful, and thus was attacked, impeached, and finally lost his official position. However, this kind of contradiction and struggle is not of much positive significance in the face of the resistance of the peasant class. On the contrary, Hai Rui has always advocated the use of counter-revolutionary strategies such as "killing and pacifying, both must be used," and "using troops to appease the people, both must be carried out at the same time" against the uprising peasants. Here, Hai Rui, whom Comrade Wu Han calls the "leftist" of the feudal landlord ruling class, has made his class stand very clear. However, Comrade Wu Han in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" distorted and defended Hai Rui's reactionary position, concealing the irreconcilable contradiction between him and the peasants, and even portraying Hai Rui as the representative of the peasants' interests. The peasants trusted him extremely, calling him "Father Hai" and "Blue-Sky Hai," worshiping him like a god. According to Comrade Wu Han's depiction, it seems that in feudal society, only the "right-wing" of the landlord class is the oppressor of the peasants, while the so-called "left-wing" of the landlord class is the protector of the peasants, as if the fate of the peasants depends on whether this "left-wing" of the landlord class can gain power. In this way, the nature and boundaries of the internal contradictions of the ruling class in the feudal era and the contradictions of the opposing classes at that time are completely confused.
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" portrays Hai Rui as a figure above class. He is not only a loyal minister of the feudal ruling class but also the "savior" of the ruled class. In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han also insisted that Hai Rui's "land return" and other measures implemented during his tenure as governor "collided with the foundation of the landlord regime and autocratic politics." In fact, whether subjectively or objectively, Hai Rui never touched the foundation of the feudal regime; on the contrary, he faithfully maintained the feudal regime. He ordered local officials to return land, but only to "mediate" the increasingly acute class contradictions at that time according to the "ancestral laws" so that the feudal rule could be consolidated. In Hai Rui's view, the system of exploitation of "serving the superiors" is a matter of course and cannot be shaken. Here, there is no question of shaking the political foundation of the landlord autocratic regime at all. If Hai Rui really "collided" with the "political foundation" of this regime as Comrade Wu Han said, wouldn't he have become an anti-feudal revolutionary hero! However, this is just a fabrication by Comrade Wu Han.
    Artistic Fiction Cannot Distort the Historical Destiny of Characters
    Comrade Wu Han's depiction of the historical destiny of Hai Rui in the play also violates historical truth. This play strives to highlight Hai Rui's "will" to "fight" for the interests of the people, and painstakingly designs a bright ending for this play, so that Hai Rui, who was dismissed from office, resolutely executed the tyrant Xu Ying and the corrupt official Wang Mingyou at the time of handing over power, becoming the victor of this struggle. In fact, the historical Hai Rui was a tragic figure full of contradictions. On the one hand, there was an irreconcilable contradiction between Hai Rui and the peasant class; on the other hand, within the ruling class, he was opposed by the powerful faction and encountered obstacles everywhere. During his tenure as Yingtian Governor, although he subjectively wanted to "do his best to establish a foundation for Jiangnan for thousands of years," the result was that he only worked for nine months before being impeached and dismissed. In his "Petition for Self-Declaration of Incompetence," he admitted that he was a failure. As for the reasons for the formation of this tragedy, it was definitely not "colliding with the foundation of the landlord regime and autocratic politics" as Comrade Wu Han said, but under the situation of various contradictions intertwined in the society at that time, the task he admitted to salvaging the decline of the Ming Dynasty was extremely disproportionate to what he could do. In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han forcibly wrote Hai Rui into a heroic image, and even had the chorus behind the scenes sing "Father Hai cannot be kept when he returns to the south, and thousands of families burn incense to worship him as a living Buddha" to render his glory and immortality. This kind of artistic "fiction" precisely expresses Comrade Wu Han's idealistic historical view of canceling class analysis and not observing the destiny of characters from historical development.
    Of course, historical dramas are allowed to have artistic fiction. But in any case, artistic fiction is to highlight, concentrate, and typically express the class relations and class characteristics of historical figures in the historical era. Comrade Wu Han's creation of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is, however, subjectively taking historical material, arbitrarily embellishing, exaggerating, and fabricating it, and forcibly adding things to him that Hai Rui could not have done at that time. This is completely beyond the scope of artistic fiction and can only be said to be a conscious distortion of historical truth to promote one's own thoughts and viewpoints.
    What is the Intention of Distorting History?
    History is a history of class struggle, and historical dramas should also reflect the true situation of class struggle in history. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out more than 20 years ago that "history is created by the people, but on the old opera stage (in all old literature and art that are separated from the people) the people have become dregs, and the stage is ruled by masters, wives, young masters, and young ladies"; therefore, it is necessary to "reverse this reversal of history." This is precisely a glorious fighting task for revolutionary drama workers. However, Comrade Wu Han's newly compiled historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" not only failed to reverse the reversals of the past history on today's opera stage and correctly express the class relations and class struggle in history, but also fanatically beautified and eulogized Hai Rui, the ruling tool of the feudal ruling class, and spread the absurd view of historical idealism. What is the purpose of this?
    Historical research for history's sake has never existed; similarly, theatrical creation for the sake of writing plays does not exist either. Historical dramas, like other literary and artistic works, are written by authors from their own class standpoints and viewpoints for certain political purposes in the current struggle. Comrade Wu Han himself does not deny this. He once said, "Every historical drama has its creative intention and historical background, either using the past to advise the present, satirizing the present through the past, hinting at something by talking about something else, or emphasizing a certain aspect of educational significance, or having other intentions, etc., inevitably mixed with some dross, and even distorting the true face of history." He also said: "It is beyond doubt that playwrights proceed from their own viewpoints and standpoints because everyone has their own standpoints and viewpoints." However, in this "self-criticism," he made a 180-degree turn, saying that his compilation of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was "completely for the sake of the past and for the sake of writing plays," and that he "never thought of" the words of using the past to serve the present that he had said more than once. This can only show that this "self-criticism" is deceptive. So, what is the purpose of his writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" at the expense of "distorting the true face of history"? We agree with the exposure and analysis made by Comrades Fang Qiu and Yao Wenyuan on this issue. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" appears in the social trend of thought that is internationally and domestically anti-Marxist and anti-socialist, forming a countercurrent with several other bad dramas. This is not an accidental or isolated phenomenon. This is a concrete reflection of the struggle between two roads in the ideological field. Capitalist and feudalist ideas attempt to "borrow a corpse to return the soul" through "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"; the author's eulogy of Hai Rui, a historical figure who is said to have "dared to fight to the end with the dark forces," is precisely an attempt to establish a historical model for the "opposition" in the socialist era. The political purpose of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to serve the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the landlord class is very obvious.

    颠倒了历史的《海瑞罢官》
    史军
    吴晗同志在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》一文中罗列了许多史料，证明《海瑞罢官》的创作是有历史根据的。他的错误只不过是把海瑞“突出得过分了，形象过于高大了”，因而使读者和观众觉得海瑞是“为人民的”。吴晗同志的检查是极不诚实和极不深刻的，需要继续同他辩论，直至彻底分清是非。
    这里，只从《海瑞罢官》颠倒历史这个方面，提出一些看法。
    《海瑞罢官》歪曲了阶级斗争的真象
    在历史上，任何人物的活动都要受阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的制约，体现出他的阶级和倾向。历史剧既要典型地反映历史人物的活动，当然就必须把历史人物放在一定的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的典型环境中去描写。
    海瑞在明代隆庆三、四年间（一五六九——一五七○）出任应天巡抚。那时，由于自嘉靖以来，江南农村中地主阶级大肆兼并土地，鱼肉百姓，迫使大批农民四处逃亡。在他出任巡抚的这一年，苏、松、常、镇一带，潦涝成灾，饥民万千。这种情况一方面给封建政权的经济收入造成严重困难，另一方面也激起了人民的不断反抗。这就使海瑞这样较有远见的封建统治阶级官吏忧心忡忡。因此，他一到任就一方面强调训练兵丁，加强对农民的戒备。另一方面组织民工疏浚吴淞江和白茆河，以便“修复水利”，“赈济饥民”，“安戢民变”。面对这样尖锐的阶级斗争的形势，海瑞能够在他的职权之内，推行一些所谓“兴利除弊”的措施，正是农民阶级长期斗争产生的结果，就封建统治阶级来说，则是为了消弥日益高涨的农民反抗斗争。而吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里却掩饰了当时江南阶级斗争的实际内容，在“自我批评”中还强调什么在苏、松“这个地区的阶级矛盾是农民对乡官的矛盾，不是一般地农民对地主的矛盾；这个地区的阶级斗争是农民对乡官的阶级斗争”。这就把海瑞排除在和农民对立的阶级之外，把在阶级矛盾中处于剥削统治地位的海瑞，颠倒成为站在被剥削、被压迫地位的农民阶级的立场上，为农民阶级利益而斗争的英雄。他不仅模糊了“清官”海瑞的阶级实质，也抹煞了“封建社会的主要矛盾，是农民阶级和地主阶级的矛盾”的这一历史发展中的基本事实。
    尽管《海瑞罢官》描写了洪阿兰一家的苦难，可是吴晗同志既然抹杀了当时的基本矛盾，也就不可能提出解决矛盾的根本办法。他所提出的解决这个矛盾的方法，只是要农民依靠“清官大老爷”“为民做主”。既然“清官”是解决矛盾的主导方面，在这出戏里的贫苦农民遭受迫害的情节，就成为戏剧冲突的一个背景，目的只是为了烘托农民“救星”海瑞。在《海瑞罢官》里出场的农民，都被作者写成是只会向“青天大老爷”叩头呼冤，只会说“感恩戴德”、“朝夕礼拜”一类话的驯顺的人物，这是不无原因的。
    在封建社会，由于历史条件的限制和统治阶级思想的影响，农民阶级中会有些人对封建统治阶级、尤其是“清官”，存在着一定的幻想。但是做为一个阶级来说，农民长期处在受压迫、受剥削的地位，决定了他们必然会产生反抗封建统治阶级的思想和行动。海瑞所处的时代，正是农民阶级积累着仇恨、酝酿着大规模反抗斗争的时候。苏、松地区的阶级斗争，已经出现了剑拔弩张的形势。海瑞离任后不久，松江的华亭，便有三县数万民众蜂涌而至，抄了恶霸地主董其昌的家①。这里的农民阶级，
  哪里是象吴晗同志笔下那样一群消极无为的“群氓”呢？吴晗同志在这出戏中这样极力渲染当时农民对封建统治阶级“清官”的幻想，不正是马克思和恩格斯曾经批判过的那种认为“农民要求于贵族的仅仅是消灭滥用权力的现象，而不是消灭制度本身”②的错误观点的再现吗？
    海瑞是“撞在地主政权、专制政治基础上了”吗？
    《海瑞罢官》选择了统治阶级内部矛盾来结构戏剧的主要矛盾冲突，并无不可。问题在于吴晗同志从根本上抹煞了历史上农民阶级的革命精神，并且错误地把“清官”海瑞描写成为站在农民立场为农民利益而斗争一生的英雄，因而在《海瑞罢官》里也就把封建统治阶级内部矛盾斗争歪曲了。
      历史告诉我们：封建统治阶级内部，由于不同集团间的利益冲突和他们对阶级斗争的形势有不同的认识，因而对于如何维护与巩固王朝统治、如何制定和执行剥削农民的具体政策等方面，往往产生这样那样的分歧。特别是当一个王朝没落的时期，更是如此。在这个时候，也会出现一些内部的“反对派”人物，从统治阶级的整体利益和长远利益出发，抨击朝政，甚至对最高统治者——皇帝，也提出一些劝告和指责。这种斗争，有时是十分激烈的。海瑞就曾冒死直谏，向嘉靖皇帝上《治安疏》；并曾直言不讳地怒骂过名重一时的“党邪言官”；后来一旦荣任应天巡抚，更“以身为标”，搞了一套裁抑豪强的措施，因而受到攻击、弹劾，终于丢了官。但是，这种矛盾和斗争，在农民阶级的反抗面前，是没有多大积极意义的。相反，海瑞一直主张对起义的农民采取“杀伐抚绥，并举无遗”、“用兵安民，并行不悖”的反革命策略。在这里，吴晗同志称之为封建地主统治阶级“左派”的海瑞，已把自己的阶级立场剖白得十分清楚。而吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里，却对海瑞的反动立场曲为回护，掩饰了他和农民之间存在的不可调和的矛盾，甚至把海瑞描写成农民利益的代表者，农民对他极端信任，称之为“海父”“海青天”，奉之若神人。按照吴晗同志的描写，似乎在封建社会里，只有地主阶级的“右派”才是农民的压迫者，而地主阶级中的所谓“左派”却是农民的保护人，好象农民的命运就取决于这个地主阶级“左派”能否得势。这样便把封建时代统治阶级的内部矛盾以及当时对立阶级的矛盾的性质与界限，完全混淆了。
      《海瑞罢官》把海瑞描写成一个超阶级的人物。他既是封建统治阶级的忠臣，又是被统治阶级的“救星”。吴晗同志在“自我批评”中，还坚持海瑞在巡抚任上推行的“退田”等措施，是“撞在地主政权、专制政治基础上了”。其实，无论在主观或客观上，海瑞从来也没有触动封建政权的基础；恰恰相反，他正是忠心耿耿地维护封建政权。他勒令乡官退田，不过是按着“祖宗成法”，来“调停”一下当时日趋尖锐的阶级矛盾，使封建统治得到巩固。在海瑞看来，“以下奉上”的剥削制度，是天经地义的，是不能动摇的。这里，根本不存在动摇地主专制政权政治基础的问题。海瑞如果真象吴晗同志所说的那样“撞在”这个政权的“政治基础”上了，那岂不成了反封建的革命英雄了！然而，这只是吴晗同志的一种臆造。
    艺术虚构不能歪曲人物的历史命运
    吴晗同志在戏里对海瑞这个人物的历史命运的描绘，也是违反历史真实的。这出戏竭力突出海瑞为人民利益而“战斗”的“意志”，煞费苦心地为这个戏设计了一个光明的尾巴，让罢官而去的海瑞在交革之际，还坚决地处死了恶霸徐瑛与贪官王明友，成为这场斗争的胜利者。其实，历史上的海瑞却是一个充满矛盾的悲剧性的人物。海瑞一方面和农民阶级存在着不可调和的矛盾；另一方面在统治阶级内部，受到当权派的反对，处处碰壁。在应天巡抚任内，虽然主观上想“竭尽心力，为江南立千百年基业”，但结果只干了九个月，便被弹劾下台。他在《被论自陈不职疏》里，就承认是个失败者。至于形成这种悲剧的原因，则决不是象吴晗同志所说的，“撞在地主政权、专制政治基础上”，而是在当时社会的各种矛盾交织的形势之下，他所自承的挽回明王朝颓败的任务，同他所能做到的极不相称。吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里，却硬把海瑞写成一个英雄的形象，甚至还由幕后合唱“海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧”作结尾，以渲染他的光荣与不朽。这种艺术上的“虚构”，正是表现了吴晗同志取消阶级分析，不从历史发展中观察人物命运的唯心主义历史观点。
    当然，历史剧是允许艺术虚构的。但是无论如何，艺术虚构是为了更突出、更集中、更典型地表现历史时代的阶级关系和历史人物的阶级特征。吴晗同志创作《海瑞罢官》，却是主观地取舍历史素材，随心所欲地加以粉饰、夸大和捏造，把当时决非海瑞所能做得到的事情，硬加在他的身上。这便完全不是艺术虚构范围之内的事了，只能说是为了宣扬自己的思想、观点，而有意识地歪曲历史真象。
      颠倒历史的用意何在？
    历史是一部阶级斗争的历史，历史剧也应该反映历史上阶级斗争的真实情况。毛泽东同志早在二十多年前便指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台”；因此，需要把“这种历史的颠倒”，“再颠倒过来”③。这正是革命的戏剧工作者的一项光荣的战斗任务。而吴晗同志的新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》，非但没有在今天的戏曲舞台上把过去历史上的颠倒再颠倒过来，正确地表现历史上的阶级关系和阶级斗争，反而狂热地美化和歌颂封建统治阶级的统治工具海瑞，散布历史唯心主义的荒谬观点，这究竟是为了什么呢？
      为历史而历史的历史研究，是从来没有过的；同样，为写戏而写戏的戏剧创作，也是不存在的。历史剧和其他文艺作品一样，都是作者从自己的阶级立场和观点出发，为了现实斗争中的某种政治目的而编写的。这一点，吴晗同志自己也并不否认。他曾经说过：“每一个历史剧都有它的创作意图和时代背景，或者以古谕今，以古讽今，指桑骂槐，或者是强调某一方面的教育意义，或者有其他意图等等，总不免夹杂一些糟粕，甚至对历史真实面貌有所歪曲。”④他还说：“剧作家从自己的观点、立场出发，这是不容怀疑的，因为谁都有他的立场观点。”⑤而在这篇“自我批评”中，他却来了个一百八十度的大转弯，竟说他之编写《海瑞罢官》，“完全是为古而古，为写戏而写戏”，竟“一点也没有想起过”自己说过不止一次的古为今用的话。这只能说明这篇“自我批评”是骗人的。那么，他写《海瑞罢官》不惜“对历史真实面貌有所歪曲”的目的何在呢？我们同意方求同志和姚文元同志就这个问题所作的揭露与分析。《海瑞罢官》出现在国际、国内反马克思主义、反社会主义的社会思潮之中，与另外几出坏戏，形成一股逆流，不是什么偶然的、孤立的现象。这正是在意识形态领域内两条道路斗争的具体反映。资本主义思想、封建主义思想企图通过《海瑞罢官》“借尸还魂”；作者歌颂海瑞这样一个历史上所谓“敢于和黑暗势力斗争到底”的人物，正是企图为社会主义时代的“反对派”树立一个历史上的榜样。《海瑞罢官》为资产阶级、地主阶级复辟服务的政治目的，是十分明显的。
