    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. News from various parts of South Vietnam continues to report the good news of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas victoriously striking the enemy in the opening days of the New Year.
    According to Western news agencies, in the first three days of the New Year, the Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas constantly attacked and sniped at enemy troops conducting "sweeps" near Bao Trai, 32 kilometers west of Saigon. This enemy force, composed of several battalions, included the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade, Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, and South Vietnamese puppet troops. They vainly attempted to "search and destroy" the people's armed forces at the northern end of the Mekong Delta. However, an Associated Press report admitted, "Because of the sniper fire, people often have to crouch and advance." "In seven hours, the entire battalion only advanced thirty yards." "Suddenly, the Viet Cong (Liberation Army) began to fire fiercely from positions in a high sugarcane field. This (173rd Airborne) Brigade suffered the first casualties of 1966." "They (the paratroopers) fought rolling around in waist-deep mud." "As the wounded were dragged through the swamp, blood smeared on the cogon grass, staining the muddy water red."
    On New Year's Eve, the Liberation Armed Forces destroyed an enemy outpost 50 kilometers southwest of Saigon, and all the defending troops were wiped out. On the same night, the headquarters of the U.S. Special Forces in Nha Trang, 320 kilometers northeast of Saigon, was bombed. According to preliminary reports, the Liberation Armed Forces "blew a hole in the roof of a recreation room in this headquarters." Five American invaders were wounded, one of them seriously.
    After the Liberation Armed Forces captured and burned an enemy stronghold 8 kilometers north of Quang Ngai on the morning of the 2nd, they fiercely attacked a puppet army outpost 15 kilometers southwest of Quang Ngai on the same night. The enemy was panic-stricken and hurriedly dispatched U.S. Marines from the Chu Lai base to rescue them, but they were also heavily hit, suffering heavy casualties.
    Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Saigon News: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces continued to launch attacks on some important enemy peripheral strongholds in Quang Ngai city, the capital of Quang Ngai province, on December 29th and 30th of last year.
    According to Western news agencies, after the Liberation Armed Forces captured Minh Long county town, southwest of Quang Ngai city, which was defended by nearly 250 puppet troops, on the 29th, they then shelled two enemy strongholds on the periphery of Minh Long and occupied these two strongholds on the 30th. At the same time, the Liberation Armed Forces also captured a peripheral stronghold of Son Ha county town, about 25 kilometers west of Quang Ngai city. According to reports, the Liberation Armed Forces launched an all-night bombardment of this stronghold on the night of the 29th, and launched an attack at 6:00 a.m. on the 30th. One hour later, radio communication between this stronghold and the outside world was interrupted, and then the stronghold was completely occupied. The report said that the planes sent to the scene for reconnaissance reported that "the South Vietnamese troops guarding this stronghold were either killed or captured." The news said that when this stronghold was besieged, the South Vietnamese puppet authorities were afraid of being ambushed by the Liberation Armed Forces and did not dare to send troops to rescue it.
    Minh Long and Son Ha are two important military strongholds of the enemy in Quang Ngai province, and they both control the valley passages leading to Quang Ngai city. Ba Gia, another important stronghold located on the valley passage, has already been occupied by the Liberation Armed Forces some time ago. (Attached picture)

    南越解放军广泛勇猛出击新年再传捷报
    在解放军沉重打击下美伪军死伤累累惊恐万状
    新华社三日讯　南越各地继续传来了越南南方解放武装力量和游击队在新年开始的日子里胜利打击敌人的喜讯。
    据西方通讯社报道，在新年的头三天里，解放武装力量和游击队不断袭击和狙击前往西贡以西三十二公里的保寨附近进行“扫荡”的敌军。这股由数营兵力组成的敌军，包括美国第一七三空降旅、澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军以及南越伪军。他们妄图“搜索和消灭”湄公河三角洲北端的人民武装力量。但是，美联社的消息承认，“由于狙击的火力，人们经常得蹲伏前进。”“在七个小时里，整个营才前进了三十码。”“突然间，越共（解放军）从一片高高的甘蔗地里的阵地上开始猛烈地射击。这个（一七三空降）旅遭到了一九六六年的第一批伤亡。”“他们（伞兵们）在齐腰深的泥泞里翻来滚去地战斗。”“当伤兵被拖过沼泽地的时候，鲜血擦到了青茅草上，把浑浊的水也染红了。”
    在元旦的夜晚，解放武装力量捣毁了西贡西南五十公里的一个敌军哨所，守军被全部消灭。这一晚，距西贡东北三百二十公里的芽庄美国特种部队总部挨了炸。据初步消息，解放武装力量把这个“总部的一间娱乐室屋顶炸穿了。”炸伤了五个美国侵略者，其中一个伤势十分严重。
    解放武装力量二日清晨攻占并烧毁距广义北面八公里的敌军据点之后，同天晚上，猛烈攻击了距广义西南十五公里的一个伪军哨所。敌人惊恐万状，急忙从朱莱基地抽调美国海军陆战队前去救援，但也被打得死伤累累。
    新华社一日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量去年十二月二十九和三十日继续向广义省省会广义市的一些重要的敌军外围据点发动进攻。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放武装力量二十九日在攻占了广义市西南由近二百五十名伪军防守的明龙县城后，接着又炮轰了明龙外围的两个敌军据点，并在三十日占领了这两个据点。与此同时，解放武装力量还攻占了广义市西面约二十五公里山河县城的一个外围据点。据报道，解放武装力量二十九日晚向这个据点进行了彻夜的炮轰后，于三十日清晨六时发起攻击，一个小时后，这个据点和外界的无线电联系就告中断，随后据点被全部占领。报道说，派到现场进行侦察的飞机报告，“守卫这个据点的南越军队不是被打死就是被俘”。消息说，在这个据点被围攻时，南越伪军当局怕遭到解放武装力量的伏击，一直不敢派军队去援救。
    明龙和山河是广义省敌军的两个重要军事据点，它们都控制着通往广义市的谷地通道。位于谷地通道上的另一个重要据点巴嘉在前些时候已经被解放武装力量占领。（附图片）
