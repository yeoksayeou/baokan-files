    The Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade's response did not address the central issue we raised: Why did Premier Castro unilaterally and inaccurately announce the preliminary trade negotiations between China and Cuba for 1966 on the eve of the Tricontinental Conference of the Peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America?
    Since Cuba implemented a rationed rice supply for its residents in 1962, there has been no change or increase due to the increase in China's rice exports to Cuba. Although China's rice exports to Cuba in 1966 were less than in 1965, they were still higher than in 1962 and the same as in 1963 and 1964. How can the Cuban side forcibly link the reduction in rice supply to residents with Sino-Cuban trade issues?
    Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: On January 12th, the Cuban Communist Party's official newspaper, *Granma*, published a response from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade to the remarks made by the person in charge of our Ministry of Foreign Trade to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on January 9th, making various arguments to defend Premier Castro's speech on January 2nd regarding Sino-Cuban trade issues, and claiming that the remarks of the person in charge of our Ministry of Foreign Trade were "incomprehensible." Therefore, our reporter once again visited the person in charge of our Ministry of Foreign Trade, who kindly made the following remarks:
    We have carefully studied the response from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade. We believe that it did not address the central issue raised in my remarks on January 9th, which is that preliminary negotiations on trade between China and Cuba for 1966 were underway. If the Cuban government had different opinions and requests, it could have completely raised them to the Chinese government. Why did Premier Castro suddenly unilaterally and inaccurately announce the negotiation situation on the eve of the Tricontinental Conference of the Peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America? Instead of responding to such a crucial issue, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade spent a lot of space discussing some minor issues. Even on these minor issues, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade's statements are sophistry and completely untenable.
    For example, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade insisted that, according to the preliminary trade volume discussed by the delegations of the two countries' foreign trade ministries, China's exports to Cuba were lower than in any year since 1961. This is completely unfounded. As everyone knows, if the trade volume for 1966 preliminarily discussed by the delegations of the two countries' foreign trade ministries is to be compared, it should only be compared with the trade volume agreed upon by the two governments in previous years, which is reasonable; otherwise, it is unreasonable. According to the lists of import and export goods attached to the trade protocols signed by the two governments each year, the figures for Sino-Cuban trade volume in recent years since 1961 are as follows:
  (Unit: Millions of Pesos)
    Year   China's Exports to Cuba  Cuba's Exports to China  Total Trade Volume
    1961      108.00          98.00          206.00
    1962       62.00          80.00          142.00
    1963      77.61            70.77          148.38
    1964      95.11          81.11          176.22
    1965      127.00          97.00          224.00
    1966       (84.50)      (84.00)      (168.50)
      (The figures for 1966 are preliminary figures)
    From the above figures, everyone can see that, even according to the trade volume preliminarily discussed by the delegations of the two countries' foreign trade ministries, China's exports to Cuba in 1966, although less than in 1965, were still more than in 1962 and 1963, and by no means lower than in any year since 1961. This is well-founded. As long as the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade checks the lists attached to the trade protocols jointly signed by our two governments over the years, it can calculate the above figures. However, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade used figures with three different meanings to compile a statistical table. The figures for 1961 to 1964 are the actual import and export figures of Cuba to China each year; the figure for 1965 is the figure in the list attached to the trade protocol of that year; and the figure for 1966 is the trade figure preliminarily discussed by the delegations of the two countries' foreign trade ministries. How can people get the correct concept of the increase or decrease in trade volume between the two countries by comparing statistical figures with three different calculation bases together?
    For another example, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade spent a lot of effort compiling some inexplicable figures to prove that Premier Castro's statement that Cuba exchanged two tons of sugar for one ton of Chinese rice was "absolutely correct." In fact, such a defense is very ridiculous. In fact, there has never been such a thing as exchanging two kinds of commodities in proportion in Sino-Cuban trade. The thousands of commodities imported and exported by both sides each year, including sugar and rice, are priced separately according to different commodities. There is no single exchange issue of one commodity for another. It was only after Premier Castro suggested exchanging sugar for rice on October 1, 1964, that the saying of the sugar-rice exchange ratio appeared. At that time, Premier Castro proposed that Cuba hoped to exchange one and a half kilograms of sugar for one kilogram of Chinese rice, but it was not accepted by China. This is on record. No matter what the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade says, it cannot change the fact that the Cuban side has never proposed to the Chinese side the matter of exchanging two tons of sugar for one ton of rice.
    For yet another example, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade said that because the delegation of our ministry indicated that the trade volume for 1966 suggested by our side was the maximum and that the trade volume between the two sides should be balanced, there was no need for the Cuban side to "contact for loans." This statement is specious. The delegations of our two countries' foreign trade ministries were conducting preliminary negotiations. Such a delegation can only make its maximum suggestions according to the scope of authority of the preliminary negotiations. As for trade balance, this is the principle of trade between the two countries and is explicitly stipulated in the Sino-Cuban trade protocols over the years. However, this does not prevent the use of loans to make up for the trade deficit when an imbalance actually occurs in the trade between the two countries. Cuba has done this in the past few years. In this preliminary negotiation, the delegation of our ministry, on the one hand, put forward the principle of trade balance, and on the other hand, suggested that the Cuban side consult with our relevant departments on the issue of using economic cooperation loans. However, the Cuban side did not consult, but instead pushed the responsibility on us, which is not convincing. People cannot help but ask: Why did Cuba do this in the past few years, but not this year?
    The Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade also said that because the amount of rice that China initially agreed to provide has decreased, the Cuban government needs to explain to the people that it is necessary to reduce the monthly rice supply per person from six pounds to three pounds starting from January 1966. Of course, how much rice is supplied to Cuban residents each month is entirely a matter for the Cuban government. However, since the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade has linked this issue with Sino-Cuban trade, we cannot but explain the situation related to us.
    As far as we know, Cuba started to implement a rationed supply of six pounds of rice per person per month in 1962. In that year, China's rice exports to Cuba were 120,000 tons. Subsequently, in 1963 and 1964, China exported 135,000 tons of rice to Cuba each year, and the rice supply for Cuban residents did not change. In 1965, China's rice exports to Cuba almost doubled, and the rice supply for Cuban residents did not increase as a result. In 1966, according to the figures preliminarily discussed by both sides, China's rice exports to Cuba were indeed less than in 1965, but still higher than in 1962, and equal to that of 1963 and 1964. In the face of such facts, how can we forcibly link the reduction of rice supply to residents in Cuba with Sino-Cuban trade issues?
    If the Cuban side truly hopes that China will export more rice to Cuba in 1966 due to difficulties in foreign relations, it can completely raise it in higher-level negotiations as in the past. However, the Cuban side unilaterally and inaccurately announced the negotiation situation while the preliminary negotiations of the delegations of our two countries' foreign trade ministries were still in progress, and pushed the responsibility for reducing the rice supply to residents onto China, which indeed makes us have to doubt that the Cuban side's purpose in doing so lies elsewhere!
    Finally, the person in charge of our Ministry of Foreign Trade stated: Sino-Cuban trade negotiations in the past few years have encountered some problems every year, but satisfactory results have been achieved by both sides every year. We sincerely hope that the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade will attach importance to the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples and conduct friendly consultations to ensure that the trade negotiations in 1966 can proceed smoothly.

### 我外贸部负责人再谈中古贸易问题

    我外贸部负责人再谈中古贸易问题
    古巴外贸部的答复，没有回答我方提出的中心问题：为什么卡斯特罗总理突然在亚非拉三洲人民团结会议召开前夕，单方面地不真实地公布中古两国正在进行的一九六六年贸易初步谈判情况？
    古巴从一九六二年开始对居民实行大米定量供应以来，并没有因为我国对古巴的大米出口量增加而有所变动和增加。一九六六年我国对古巴的大米出口量虽比一九六五年少，仍然高于一九六二年，同于一九六三年和一九六四年。古巴方面怎么能把减少对居民的大米供应量，硬同中古贸易问题联系在一起呢？
    新华社三十日讯　一月十二日，古巴共产党机关报《格拉玛报》刊登了古巴对外贸易部对我国对外贸易部负责人一月九日同本社记者谈话的答复，多方为卡斯特罗总理一月二日演说中有关中古贸易问题的谈话进行辩解，并且说我国对外贸易部负责人的谈话“是不可理解的”。为此，本社记者再次走访我国对外贸易部负责人，承蒙发表谈话如下：
    我们仔细地研究了古巴对外贸易部的答复，我们认为它并没有回答我在一月九日谈话中所提出的中心问题，那就是，中古两国一九六六年贸易的初步谈判正在进行，古巴政府如有不同意见和要求，完全可以向中国政府提出来，为什么卡斯特罗总理突然在亚非拉三洲人民团结会议召开前夕，单方面地不真实地公布谈判情况呢？对于这样一个关键问题，古巴对外贸易部没有答复，反而花了很大篇幅谈了一些枝节问题，即使在这些枝节问题上，古巴对外贸易部的说法也都是强词夺理，完全站不住脚的。
    例如：古巴对外贸易部硬说，按照两国对外贸易部代表团初步商谈的一九六六年贸易额，中国对古巴的出口低于一九六一年以来任何一年。这是完全没有根据的。大家知道，两国对外贸易部代表团初步商谈的一九六六年贸易额，如果要比较的话，只能同两国政府历年商定的贸易额比较，才是合理的，否则就是不合理的。根据两国政府每年签订的贸易议定书附表所列的进出口货单，一九六一年以来中古历年贸易额数字如下：
  （单位：百万比索）
    年　度  　中国对古巴的出口　  古巴对中国的出口　总贸易额
    1961      　108．00　          98．00　          206．00
    1962       　62．00　          80．00　          142．00
    1963　       77．61            70．77          　148．38
    1964　       95．11          　81．11          　176．22
    1965      　127．00　          97．00　          224．00
    1966       （84．50）      　 （84．00）　      （168．50）
      （一九六六年是初步商谈数字）
    从上述数字，大家可以看到，即使根据两国对外贸易部代表团初步商谈的贸易额，一九六六年中国对古巴的出口，虽然少于一九六五年，仍然多于一九六二年和一九六三年，而绝不是低于一九六一年以来任何一年。这是有根有据的，只要古巴对外贸易部查一查历年来我们两国政府代表共同签订的贸易议定书附表，就可以计算出上述数字。可是，古巴对外贸易部却用三种不同含义的数字编造了一个统计表。一九六一年到一九六四年是古巴每年对中国实际进出口的数字；一九六五年是当年贸易议定书附表的数字；一九六六年是两国对外贸易部代表团初步商谈的贸易数字。把三种不同计算基础的统计数字放在一起进行比较，又怎么能使人们得出两国贸易额增减的正确概念呢？
    又如：古巴对外贸易部花了很大的力气，编造了一些莫明其妙的数字，证明卡斯特罗总理所说的古巴用两吨糖换中国一吨大米的话是“绝对正确的”。其实这样的辩解是非常可笑的。事实上，在中古两国贸易中从来没有用两种商品按比例交换这样的事。双方每年进出口的上千种商品，包括糖和米在内，都是按不同商品分别计价的，根本不存在某一商品与另一商品的单项交换问题。只是在一九六四年十月一日卡斯特罗总理建议以糖换米之后，才出现了糖米交换比例的说法。当时，卡斯特罗总理提出的是，古巴希望用一公斤半糖换中国一公斤大米，但没有被中国接受，这是有案可查的。不管古巴对外贸易部怎么说，都不能改变古巴方面从来没有向中国方面提过两吨糖换一吨大米的事实。
    再如：古巴对外贸易部说，因为我部代表团表示了我方建议的一九六六年贸易额是最大限度的，双方贸易额应当平衡，所以古巴方面就没有必要“接洽贷款”了。这种说法是似是而非的。我们两国对外贸易部代表团进行的是初步谈判。这样的代表团当然只能根据初步谈判的职权范围提出其最大限度的建议。至于贸易平衡，这是两国贸易的原则，并且在历年中古贸易议定书上作了明文规定。但是，这并不妨碍在两国贸易实际上出现不平衡时，用贷款来弥补贸易差额。在过去几年中，古巴都是这样做的。在这次初步谈判中，我部代表团一面提出贸易平衡的原则，一面建议古方同我有关部门商量动用经济合作贷款的问题。可是古巴方面不去商量，反而把责任推在我们身上，这是不能令人信服的。人们不禁要问：为什么过去几年古巴都这样做，而今年却不这样做呢？
    古巴对外贸易部还说，由于中国初步同意提供的大米数量减少了，古巴政府需要向人民说明有必要从一九六六年一月起，把每人每月的大米供应量从六磅减少到三磅。当然，每月供应古巴居民多少大米，这完全是古巴政府的事。不过，古巴对外贸易部既然把这个问题同中古贸易联系在一起，我们就不能不说明一下同我们有关的情况。
    据我们了解，古巴是从一九六二年开始对居民实行每人每月六磅大米的定量供应的。这一年我国对古巴的大米出口量是十二万吨。其后，一九六三年和一九六四年我国每年向古巴出口大米十三万五千吨，古巴居民的大米供应量没有变动。一九六五年我国对古巴的大米出口量几乎增加一倍，古巴居民的大米供应量也并没有因而增加。一九六六年，根据双方初步商谈的数字，我国对古巴的大米出口量诚然是比一九六五年减少了，但仍然高于一九六二年，而同一九六三年、一九六四年相等。在这样的事实面前，怎么能把古巴减少对居民的大米供应量，硬要同中古贸易问题联系在一起呢？
    如果古巴方面确实由于对外关系方面的困难，真心希望我国在一九六六年多向古巴出口一些大米，它完全可以象过去一样，在高一级的谈判中提出来。可是古巴方面在我们两国对外贸易部代表团的初步谈判仍在进行的时候，就单方面地、不真实地公布谈判情况，并且把减少居民的大米供应量的责任推到中国身上，这确实使我们不能不怀疑古巴方面这样做的目的另有所在！
    最后，我国对外贸易部负责人表示：中古两国几年来的贸易谈判，每年都遇到过一些问题，但每年都得到了双方满意的结果。我们真诚地希望古巴对外贸易部以中古两国人民的友谊为重，通过友好协商，使一九六六年的贸易谈判得以顺利进行。
