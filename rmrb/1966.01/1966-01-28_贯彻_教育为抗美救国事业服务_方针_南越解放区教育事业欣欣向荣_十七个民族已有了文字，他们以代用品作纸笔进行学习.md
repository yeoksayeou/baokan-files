    Implementing the policy of "Education Serving the Anti-American National Salvation Cause"
    The Education Undertaking in the South Vietnamese Liberated Areas is Thriving
    Seventeen Ethnic Groups Now Have Written Languages, and They Use Substitutes for Paper and Pens to Study
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th) - This reporter reports: The education undertaking in the South Vietnamese liberated areas, implementing the policy of "Education Serving the Anti-American National Salvation Cause," has achieved vigorous development. To date, in the liberated areas, which account for four-fifths of the total area of South Vietnam, 4,578 ordinary schools have been established, with a total of over 500,000 students. Many rural areas have also opened literacy classes, enrolling a large number of peasants' children.
    In the central Trung Bo region, where the struggle is extremely fierce, the people of various localities have overcome numerous difficulties and worked hard to develop education. They have opened 982 classes with a total of more than 53,300 students. A village west of Cu Chi County in Gia Dinh Province, located on Highway 7 and only thirty kilometers from Saigon, is frequently subjected to enemy "sweeps," bombings, and artillery fire. However, the education undertaking in this village is doing well, with over 90% of school-age children attending school.
    In the minority areas of the Central Highlands (Tay Nguyen), the education undertaking is also developing rapidly. Currently, seventeen ethnic groups have their own written languages. People of all ethnic groups have overcome various material difficulties to study. When there is no paper, they cut down "Lao Wu" trees to use as paper; when there is no chalk, they use white pottery clay, charcoal, and dried sweet potatoes as substitutes; when there is no pen nib, they use chicken feather tubes to make pen nibs; when there is no ink, they boil tree bark to make ink. When there is no lamp, they burn firewood or corn stalks for lighting.
    In teaching, schools in various localities place special emphasis on educating students to love their motherland, the Liberation Army, and to hate the enemy, constantly improving students' class consciousness and political and ideological level, and actively participating in the anti-American national salvation cause.

    贯彻“教育为抗美救国事业服务”方针
    南越解放区教育事业欣欣向荣
    十七个民族已有了文字，他们以代用品作纸笔进行学习
    据新华社河内二十七日电  本社记者报道：越南南方解放区的教育事业，贯彻“教育为抗美救国事业服务”的方针，取得了蓬勃的发展。到目前为止，在占南越总面积五分之四的解放区土地上，已经建立了四千五百七十八所普通学校，学生总人数达五十多万名。许多农村还开办了识字班，吸收大量农民子弟入学。
    斗争极为激烈的中部中区各地人民克服重重困难，努力发展教育事业，已开办了九百八十二个班，一共有五万三千三百多名学生。位于第七号公路上的嘉定省古芝县西面的一个乡，距离西贡只有三十公里，经常遭到敌人“扫荡”、轰炸和炮击，但这个乡的教育事业办得很好，百分之九十以上的学龄儿童全都上了学。
    在西原少数民族地区，教育事业也发展得很快。目前，已有十七个民族有了自己的文字。各族人民克服了物质上的各种困难，进行学习。没有纸，就砍“罗乌”树来作纸；没有粉笔，就用白陶土、木炭、干山薯来代替；没有笔尖，就用鸡毛管来制作笔尖；没有墨水，就煮树皮来制成墨水。没有灯，就烧起木柴或玉米秸来照明。
    各地学校在教学中都特别重视对学生进行热爱祖国、解放军和仇恨敌人的教育，不断提高学生的阶级觉悟和政治思想水平，积极参加抗美救国的事业。
