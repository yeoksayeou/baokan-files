    Dulate Banner Cadres
    Enthusiastically Discuss Where the Crux of the Problem Lies
    Our Banner Committee recently held a meeting to summarize the work of the past year. In order to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, the Banner Committee organized us to study the discussion column in the *People's Daily* entitled "Realize the Revolutionization of County Committee Leadership and Build a New Socialist Countryside." The comrades participating in the meeting were very interested in this, and their enthusiasm grew stronger as they studied. Every time we finished reading an article, we debated endlessly. After reading the article written by Comrade Lü Jian on November 8th of last year entitled "The Crux of the Problem is Not Here," the debate became even more intense. At the beginning, some said: "Comrade Lü Jian is right." Others said: "He is not right." In order to clarify the essence of the article, the comrades read it word by word several times in a row, and then, after repeated discussions, reached a unanimous understanding, which we put forward for discussion:
    We believe that Comrade Lü Jian's view is wrong. It is a rigid, metaphysical viewpoint, and it also fails to analyze the development process of things from a class viewpoint.
    We believe that solving the problem of "serving whom" is a long-term ideological struggle process. Because: Firstly, our country has tens of millions of cadres, and they come from different backgrounds and various fields. After the Party's long-term cultivation and education, many comrades have basically firmly established the confidence and determination to work for the revolution. No matter what problems and difficulties they encounter, their will to wholeheartedly serve the revolution will not waver. However, some comrades have an unswerving revolutionary will and need to continue to temper and transform their thinking in revolutionary practice. Secondly, there are also individuals who originally did establish the idea of working for the revolution, but when they encounter difficulties or things that are unfavorable to them, they develop this or that kind of ideological problem, and even embark on a path of serious errors. How can it be said that the problem of "serving the people" has been solved? Judging from the current situation, the problem of "serving the people" has not necessarily been solved for some comrades. Taking going to the countryside as an example, some people seem to have gone down on the surface, but after going down, they do not implement the "three togethers" [eat, live, and work together with the peasants], work passively, and do not solve the problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved according to the Party's policies. There are also people who are in the countryside but their hearts are in the city. Has the problem of "serving the people" been solved for comrades like this?
    We believe that the issue of "serving whom" is a major issue in realizing ideological revolutionization. The two viewpoints expressed on the issue of "serving whom" are a reflection of the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. Therefore, before the bourgeoisie is eliminated, it is necessary to constantly solve the problem of "serving whom."

### 达拉特旗干部  热烈讨论症结在哪里

    达拉特旗干部
    热烈讨论症结在哪里
    我们旗委最近开会总结一年的工作。旗委为了用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，组织我们学习了《人民日报》刊登的“实现县委领导革命化，建设社会主义新农村”的讨论专栏。与会同志对此很有兴趣，越学劲头越大，每当读完一篇，互相争论不休。当读完去年十一月八日吕健同志写的题为《症结不在这儿》这篇文章以后，大家争论得更热烈。刚一开始，有的说：“吕健同志说得对。”有的说：“说得不对。”同志们为了弄清文章的精神实质，于是又一字一句地一连读了几遍，然后又经过反复的讨论，得出一致的认识，提出来商榷：
    我们认为，吕健同志的看法是错误的，是一种一成不变的形而上学的观点，也是没有用阶级观点来分析事物的发展过程。
    我们认为，解决“为谁服务”的问题，是一个长期的思想斗争过程。因为：一则我们国家拥有数以千万计的干部，而且出身不同，来自各个方面，经过党长期的培养和教育，不少同志，基本坚定了为革命而工作的信心和决心，不论遇到什么问题和困难，一心为革命的意志是不会动摇的。但也有部分同志革命意志不坚定，需要在革命的实践中，继续锻炼，改造思想。二则，也有个别的人原来确实是确立了为革命而工作的思想，但遇有困难或者是对他不利的事，就产生了这样或那样的思想问题，甚至走上了严重错误的道路。这怎么能说“为人民服务”的问题已经解决了呢？就从现实情况来看，有些同志“为人民服务”的问题也不一定解决了。就拿下乡来说，有的人从表面上看是下去了，但下去后，不执行“三同”，工作消极，不按照党的政策解决群众迫切要求解决的问题。也有的人是人在乡下，心在城市。象这样的同志，他的“为人民服务”的问题难道算解决了吗？
    我们认为，“为谁服务”的问题，是实现思想革命化的一个主要问题。“为谁服务”的问题上表现出来的两种观点，是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想斗争的反映。因此，在资产阶级未消灭之前，就要不断解决“为谁服务”的问题。
