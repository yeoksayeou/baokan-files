    South Vietnam National Liberation Front Calls for a Halt to US Imperialism's Murderous Claws
    Strongly Condemn US Imperialism's Frantic Massacre of the South Vietnamese People; Call on the Military and Civilians to Resolutely Resist America, Kill the Enemy, and Avenge Our Blood Debt
    South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency Points Out: The American Aggressors Have Adopted a "Burn All, Destroy All, Kill All" Scorched Earth Policy More Barbaric Than That of the Hitler Fascists and Japanese Militarists. Their Crimes are Unforgivable by Heaven and Earth, and All People of Conscience Cannot Help But Condemn Them.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, Thirteenth—The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency issued a statement on the twelfth, strongly condemning and denouncing the towering crimes of the American aggressors and their running dogs in inhumanly slaughtering the people of South Vietnam recently. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Recently, after suffering heavy defeats on various battlefields, the American aggressors and their running dogs have resorted to extremely despicable and inhuman means to frantically massacre innocent people in South Vietnam. Their crimes are unforgivable by Heaven and Earth, and all people of conscience cannot help but condemn them.
    In the past few days, following the monstrous crime of the South Korean puppet army's massacre of our compatriots in Tan Giang Village, Binh Dinh Province, paratroopers of the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade have launched a large-scale "mopping-up" operation in the Bao Trai area of Di An Province. They adopted a "burn all, destroy all, kill all" scorched earth policy more barbaric than that adopted by the Hitler fascists and Japanese militarists in World War II. All the utensils, houses, and gardens of our compatriots were burned to the ground. They killed or arrested everyone they saw, regardless of gender or age.
    The American bandits and their running dogs have stepped up the scattering of chemical poisons in vast areas and have openly declared their intention to destroy all the people's crops, attempting to starve our people to death. In particular, since the beginning of November last year, they have repeatedly scattered chemical poisons in many areas of provinces such as Xin An-Di An, Tu Long Mu, Ba Di, Kun Son, Quang Nam, and Quang Zhi, destroying our people's crops.
    They are carrying out the destruction of villages in areas under their temporary rule one by one, such as: on November 19th last year, in the Bian Shi "strategic hamlet" in Lich Hoi Township, My Xuyen County, Soc Trang Province, a total of 709 houses and 2 temples were burned down, and hundreds of Khmer and Kinh compatriots of Buddhist faith were killed and wounded, including 6 monks. They even bombed and strafed motorboats and passenger ships traveling in areas under their control. On December 14th last year, they sank the "Huyen Huu" motorboat sailing from Thuan My City back to Xin An-Di An, causing 18 casualties, including the mother of a puppet officer, a pregnant woman, 2 students, 4 children, and the rest were all women. On January 8th this year, they sank the "Thuan Phong" passenger ship sailing from Tu Long Mu to Dau Tieng on the Saigon River, killing more than 200 of our compatriots.
    They also indiscriminately strafed fishermen fishing at sea, such as the compatriots on Bach Thach Island in Rach Gia Province, who were killed more than 50 people. They also bombed and strafed densely populated areas, such as the "Tam Quan" station dormitory, Hoai Nhon County in Binh Thuan Province, and Bien Tuc Street in Tu Long Mu Province.
    They also bombed a school in Ky Phuc Commune, Tam Ky District, Quang Nam Province, killing many students.
    The crimes of the American bandits and their running dogs are endless. The above are just typical examples of their inhumane behavior in two months.
    The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the official speaking body of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, strongly accuses the aforementioned extremely inhumane crimes of the American aggressors and their running dogs to domestic and foreign public opinion, and sternly warns the murderers: the blood debts they owe must be repaid, and our military and civilians, filled with deep hatred, will give them increasingly heavy blows.
    The recent inhumane massacres by the American aggressors and their running dogs are unprecedentedly frantic in nature. This is the performance of beasts that are seriously injured and struggling. They suffered heavy defeats in Wen Xiang, Bo Lai Mei, Bao Bang, Dau Tieng, and other battlefields, and frantically retaliated against unarmed women, children, and civilians in a despicable manner.
    It is worth noting that they do not spare the lives of people in their controlled areas, including the families of puppet soldiers and puppet regime personnel.
    The extremely inhumane and barbaric acts of the American bandits and their running dogs against our compatriots once again expose the hypocritical and deceitful nature of US President Johnson and his group's so-called "peaceful sincerity" and "unconditional discussions." Behind the peace-loving rhetoric are actions of killing, burning houses, plundering property, and raping women. After committing heinous crimes, they play with beautiful words such as "peace" and "freedom," which can only more clearly illustrate their despicable nature.
    The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on the Liberation Armed Forces, including the main forces, local forces, and militia guerrillas, to charge forward, resolutely kill the enemy, avenge the victims, and never forgive the murderous aggressors.
    The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on compatriots to unite closely, do everything possible to resist the thieves and protect their homes, fight alongside the troops, and stop the murderous claws of the American bandits and their running dogs.
    The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on personnel working in the puppet army and puppet regime organs to wake up quickly. You are using guns to work for foreigners and using them as tools to massacre your compatriots, but the lives of your loved ones have not been spared by the American aggressors, and your lives will be regarded as garbage by them.
    The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on world public opinion to strongly condemn the extremely inhumane massacres of the Vietnamese people by the American aggressors and their running dogs. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front especially calls on the mothers, wives, and all people of conscience in the United States, for the sake of justice and humanitarianism, for the honor of your loved ones, to condemn the US government for staining the reputation of the United States through barbaric massacres in South Vietnam, and to demand that the US government stop the aggressive war of massacring the Vietnamese people and withdraw US troops back home.
    The more brutal the enemy is, the more it proves that they are at a disadvantage, and they will suffer more shameful defeats. Our military and civilians will also hate the aggressors and traitors even more, and will never waver in the face of all the enemy's conspiracies, and will continue to forge ahead bravely! Use the enemy's blood to wash away hatred and strive for independence and freedom. The enemy is failing, and they will suffer even more shameful defeats. We are winning, and complete victory will belong to our people.

    南越民族解放阵线呼吁制止美帝杀人魔爪
    强烈谴责美帝疯狂屠杀南越人民 号召军民坚决抗美杀敌报仇雪恨
    越南南方解放通讯社指出：美国侵略者采取了比希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义者更为野蛮的“烧光、毁光、杀光”的焦土政策。他们的罪恶是天地不能容的，一切有良知的人都不能不加以谴责。
    新华社河内十三日电　越南南方解放通讯社十二日发表声明，强烈谴责和控诉美国侵略者及其走狗在最近期间惨无人道地屠杀越南南方人民的滔天罪行。声明全文如下：
    最近期间，美国侵略者及其走狗在各个战场上遭到了惨重的失败以后，又极其卑鄙和惨无人道地对越南南方的无辜人民进行疯狂的屠杀。他们的罪恶是天地不能容的，一切有良知的人都不能不加以谴责。
    最近几天，继南朝鲜仆从军对平定省新江村的我们同胞进行屠杀的滔天罪行之后，美军第一七三空降旅的伞兵又向堤岸省的保寨地区大肆“扫荡”。他们采取了比希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义者在第二次世界大战中采取的更为野蛮的“烧光、毁光、杀光”的焦土政策。我们同胞的所有用具、房舍、园圃都被他们烧光。他们把见到的所有人，不管男女老少，全都杀死或逮捕。
    美国强盗及其走狗加紧向广大地区撒放化学毒药，并公开宣称要毁坏人民的所有庄稼，妄图饿死我们人民。特别是从去年十一月初以来，他们曾多次向新安—堤岸、土龙木、巴地、昆嵩、广南、广治等省的许多地区撒放化学毒药，毁坏我们人民的庄稼。
    他们对其暂时统治地区里的村庄，进行逐个的破坏，如：去年十一月十九日在朔庄省美川县历会乡的边市“战略村”，共烧毁房屋七百零九幢、寺庙二座，成百名信仰佛教的高棉族和京族同胞被杀害和打伤，其中有六名僧侣。甚至在他们统治地区里行驶的机动船和客轮，他们也进行轰炸和扫射。去年十二月十四日，他们击沉从顺美市驶回新安—堤岸的
  “玄友”号机动船，使十八人伤亡，其中有一名伪军官的母亲，一名孕妇，二名学生，四名儿童，其余全是妇女。今年一月八日，他们在西贡河上击沉从土龙木开往油汀的“顺丰”号客轮，杀害我们同胞二百多名。
    他们对出海捕鱼的渔民也滥肆扫射，如迪石省白石岛的同胞就被杀害了五十多名。他们还对居民稠密区，如：“三关”车站宿舍、平顺省的怀仁县和土龙木省的边蓄街区进行轰炸和扫射。
    他们还轰炸广南省三岐县期福乡的学校，杀害许多学生。
    美国强盗及其走狗的罪恶是永远也说不完的。以上只不过是他们在两个月内的典型的人面兽心行为而已。
    越南南方民族解放阵线的正式发言机构——越南南方解放通讯社向国内外舆论强烈控诉美国侵略者及其走狗的上述极其惨无人道的罪行，并严厉警告杀人犯：他们欠下的这笔血债一定要偿还，怀着深仇大恨的我们军民将会给他们以越来越沉重的打击。
    美国侵略者及其走狗最近的惨无人道的屠杀行为是具有空前的疯狂性质的。这是遭受重伤和正在挣扎的野兽的表现。他们在文相、波来梅、保邦、油汀和其它各个战场上遭到了惨重失败，就疯狂地对手无寸铁的妇女、儿童和平民进行卑劣的报复。
    值得注意的是，他们对其统治区里的人们，包括伪军和伪政权人员的家属的生命也不放过。
    美国强盗及其走狗对我们同胞的极其惨无人道的野蛮行为，再一次揭穿了美国总统约翰逊及其集团的所谓“和平诚意”、“无条件讨论”的虚伪和诡诈性质。在爱好和平的言词后面，就是那些杀人、烧房、抢夺财物、强奸妇女的行动。在他们犯下了滔天罪行之后，却玩弄“和平”、“自由”等美妙词藻，这只能更清楚地说明他们的卑鄙本质。
    越南南方民族解放阵线号召包括主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队在内的解放武装力量，冲锋向前，坚决杀敌，为受害同胞报仇，绝不能饶恕杀人的侵略者。
    越南南方民族解放阵线号召同胞紧密团结，想尽办法抗贼保家，与部队一道进行斗争，制止美国强盗及其走狗的杀人魔爪。
    越南南方民族解放阵线号召在伪军和伪政权机关工作的人员迅速醒悟过来。你们拿枪为外国人卖命，作他们的工具来屠杀同胞，但是你们亲人的性命都没有被美国侵略者所放过，你们的性命也会被他们视为垃圾一样。
    越南南方民族解放阵线呼吁世界舆论强烈谴责美国侵略者及其走狗对越南人民的极其惨无人道的屠杀行为。越南南方民族解放阵线特别呼吁美国的母亲、妻子和一切有良心的人们，为了正义和人道主义、为了你们亲人的荣誉，谴责美国政府正通过在越南南方的野蛮屠杀行为来沾污美国的声誉，并且要求美国政府停止屠杀越南人民的侵略战争，把美国军队撤回国去。
    敌人越残暴，就越证明他们处于劣势，并将越加遭到可耻的失败，我们军民对侵略者和卖国贼也就越加仇恨，在敌人的一切阴谋面前绝不动摇，继续奋勇前进！用敌人的血来洗清仇恨，争取独立和自由。敌人正在失败，它们定将遭到更加可耻的失败。我们正在胜利，完全胜利定将属于我们人民。
