    The Immense Power of Role Models
    One day, on an oil well site in Daqing Oilfield, they were hoisting oil pipes. Ice-cold water poured down from the seven or eight-meter-high oil pipes, drenching apprentice worker Guo Lianqiao. He stood firm and continued to work without stopping. Soon, his hat and clothes were completely soaked. With the north wind blowing, he felt like he was wearing an inch-thick suit of ice armor. Someone asked him, "Is it hard?" He said, "I am doing it the way the cadres and masters do it. They are not afraid of hardship, so what am I afraid of?" After work, he wrote a poem: "Crude oil smells so fragrant, clothes are dirty but the heart is not, to seize victory, we will even climb mountains of knives."
    What power enabled the millions of workers in Daqing Oilfield to possess such revolutionary heroism with a "mountains of knives also must be climbed" spirit? This apprentice worker gave the clearest and most powerful answer: it is the power of the example of cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Only with a revolutionized leading body and cadre team can a revolutionized workforce be brought out. This is Daqing's experience and the common experience of all units that have achieved success in revolutionization.

    榜样的巨大力量
    有一天，大庆油田的一个井场上正在起油管，冰冷的水，从七八米高的油管上洒下来，劈头盖脸地浇到学徒工郭连桥的身上。他挺立不动，照样不停地工作。不一会，他的帽子，衣服，全被浇湿了，北风一吹，就象穿了一指厚的冰盔甲。有人问他：“苦不苦？”他说：“我是照着干部和师傅的样子做的，他们不怕苦，我还怕什么。”下班后，他作了一首诗：“原油喷喷香，衣脏心不脏，为了夺胜利，刀山也要上。”
    是什么力量使得大庆油田的千万工人，具有那种“刀山也要上”的革命英雄主义气概？这个学徒工做了最明确最有力的回答：是毛泽东思想武装起来的干部的榜样的力量。有了革命化的领导班子和干部班子，才能带出革命化的职工队伍，这是大庆的经验，也是一切在革命化方面获得成就的单位的共同经验。
