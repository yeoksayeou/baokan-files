    Ruan Dehui, a guerrilla fighter from Quang Nam Province, used two bombs and an unripe jackfruit to destroy two enemy armored vehicles and lured a truck full of enemy soldiers into a trap, along with the vehicle.

    At the beginning of last year, Ruan Dehui, a guerrilla from Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam, attended a celebration conference for model guerrillas in Quang Nam Province and received two landmines as a reward. He was very happy and assured the conference that he would use these two landmines to destroy two enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

    After returning, Ruan Dehui carefully studied how to blow up the armored vehicles. Every day, he went to the road frequently used by enemy vehicles to dig several fake mine pits and covered them with some torn mats and rotten cloth. At first, the enemy thought they were real mines, stopped the vehicles, and repeatedly probed with mine detectors. Then they nervously dug them up, but what they dug up were cow dung, bamboo roots, and mud. After more than a month, the enemy gradually became careless. When they saw the torn mats and rotten cloth on the road, they didn't even look at them and drove the vehicles over them.

    Ruan Dehui saw that the time was ripe and buried the first landmine. That day, a team of enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles drove from Da Nang. They ignored the torn mats and rotten cloth on the road and drove over menacingly. But this time, with a loud bang, the real landmine exploded, and an M-113 armored vehicle was overturned on the side of the road and could not move.

    Then, Ruan Dehui used the same method to overturn another enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicle.

    Ruan Dehui completed the task he had assured the conference of, using two landmines to destroy two enemy amphibious armored vehicles. He then carefully studied how to attack enemy military vehicles. Every day, he went near the road to carefully observe the enemy's situation. He found that after the amphibious armored vehicles were continuously destroyed, the enemy was very frightened and became more cautious. As long as they saw some torn mats, rotten cloth, or other suspicious things on the road, they either nervously drove the vehicles far away to avoid them or hurriedly turned the vehicles around and drove back, waiting for the engineers to detect before daring to drive over.

    Ruan Dehui tied an unripe jackfruit that looked like a landmine to a wire and buried it in the middle of the road, deliberately leaving the wire exposed on the road surface. Then, together with other guerrillas, he dug a deep trap by the roadside, disguised so that it could not be seen at all.

    Not long after, a ten-wheeled truck full of enemy soldiers drove over. The enemy soldiers in the vehicle suddenly saw a wire on the road and immediately panicked and shouted, "Landmine! Landmine!" The truck driver was so frightened that he hurriedly drove the vehicle towards the side of the road, intending to avoid this "landmine." As a result, the vehicle and the people fell into the trap together. The enemy soldiers were either killed or injured, and there was a chorus of cries.

    The next day, the enemy sent engineers and surrounded this "dangerous" area. They nervously used mine detectors to repeatedly probe this "landmine." Finally, they dug it up and saw that it was an unripe jackfruit! (Vietnam Southern Liberation News Agency)

    阮德汇巧摆地雷阵　菠萝蜜吓破敌人胆
    广南省游击战士阮德汇用两颗炸弹和一颗未熟的菠萝蜜，炸毁敌人两辆装甲车，并诱使一辆满载敌军的卡车连人带车落入陷阱。
    去年年初，越南南方广南省游击队员阮德汇出席了广南省模范游击战士庆功大会，获得了大会奖给的两颗地雷。他非常高兴，向大会保证，一定要用这两颗地雷炸毁敌人的两辆M—113型两栖装甲车。
    回去以后，阮德汇仔细地研究了爆炸装甲车的办法。每天，他跑到敌车经常来往的公路上去挖几个假地雷坑，把一些破席子和烂布盖在上面。起初，敌人以为是真的地雷，停下车来用探雷器反复探测，然后胆战心惊地去挖，但挖出来的都是些牛粪、竹根、泥块。一个多月后，敌人渐渐麻痹大意了，看到公路上的破席子和烂布，连看也不看，就把车子开了过去。
    阮德汇看到时机已经成熟，就埋下了第一颗地雷。那天，敌人的一队M—113型两栖装甲车从岘港驶来，看到公路上的一些破席子和烂布也不管，气势汹汹地开了过来，但是，这一回，轰隆一响，真的地雷爆炸了，一辆M—113型装甲车被炸翻在路旁，动弹不得了。
    接着，阮德汇又用同样的方法，又炸翻了敌人的另一辆M—113型两栖装甲车。
    阮德汇完成了向大会保证的任务，用两颗地雷炸掉了敌人的两辆两栖装甲车。他又仔细地研究打击敌人军车的办法来了。每天，他跑到公路附近去仔细观察敌人的情况。他发现，在两栖装甲车被连续炸毁以后，敌人非常惊慌，又小心起来了。他们只要看到路上有一些破席子、烂布或其他可疑的东西，不是胆战心惊地把车子避在老远一边开过去，就是急忙把车子掉头开回去，要工兵来探测后才敢开过去。
    阮德汇把一个象地雷一样的未成熟的菠萝蜜绑上一条电线，埋在公路中间，故意把电线露出在路面上。然后，他又同其他游击队员一起，在路边挖了一个深深的陷阱，伪装得一点也看不出来。
    过了不久，一辆满载敌军的十轮大卡车开过来了。车上的敌人突然看到路上有一条电线，立刻惊慌失措地大喊起来：“地雷！地雷！”卡车驾驶员吓得急忙把车向路边开去，打算躲避掉这颗“地雷”。结果，连车带人栽到陷阱里去了，敌军死的死，伤的伤，一片哭喊声。
    第二天，敌人派来了工兵，围住了这个“危险”地区。他们胆战心惊地用探雷器反复探测这颗“地雷”，最后挖出来一看，却是一颗未成熟的菠萝蜜！（越南南方解放通讯社）
