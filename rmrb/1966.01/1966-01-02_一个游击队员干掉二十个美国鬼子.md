    A Guerrilla Fighter Kills Twenty American Devils
    A brave and resourceful guerrilla fighter, Ruan Zhuan, eliminated twenty American devils with landmines and hand grenades in one battle.
    Ruan Zhuan is a brave and resourceful guerrilla fighter from H township, He Wang County, Guangnan Province. He participated in twenty-nine battles to fight back against the "mopping-up" operations of the American Marine Corps. In one instance, he eliminated twenty American devils with landmines and hand grenades.
    One day, two companies of American invading troops set out from Da Nang to "mop up" H township. Ruan Zhuan carefully observed the terrain. He estimated that the American devils would climb the small hill at the head of the village first in order to control the entire village. So, he buried landmines on the small hill.
    Just as dawn was breaking, American planes strafed the area and then airdropped the American troops. Sure enough, the American invading troops scrambled up the hill from the right side, trying to seize the high ground. So, the first landmine exploded, killing three American devils on the spot.
    The American devils who weren't killed hurriedly rolled down the hill. Ruan Zhuan, who had already been lying in ambush nearby, opened fire on the enemy troops. These American devils turned and frantically fled to the left side of the hill. But the second landmine that Ruan Zhuan had buried was waiting for them there. With a loud bang, three more American devils lost their lives.
    American helicopters strafed the air, attempting to seize the corpses of the American soldiers. There was a small flat area on the top of the hill. Ruan Zhuan had already predicted that the enemy's helicopters might land here and had buried a third landmine here. When the American devils carried six corpses to this flat area, they stepped on the landmine, losing another three lives.
    At this time, enemy aircraft frantically bombed and strafed the area to cover the retreat of the remaining American devils. However, Ruan Zhuan told a comrade to intercept the enemy's retreat, while he himself ambushed at another location. His comrade shot and killed an American soldier with one shot, scaring the remaining enemy troops into turning back and fleeing in a panic. They happened to walk into the location where Ruan Zhuan was lying in ambush. Ruan Zhuan threw three hand grenades in a row, ending the lives of eleven more American devils.
    Editor's Note
    How is the infinite power of the people's war in South Vietnam formed? Where does it come from? People can find eloquent answers in this column's communication.
    The infinite power of the people's war in South Vietnam is formed precisely by thousands of Happy Villages, by thousands of Chen Wen Zhen units, by countless Nguyen Duc Hui and Nguyen Zhuan-style heroic fighters, laying a net across the sky and the earth. Its infinite power comes precisely from the revolutionary heroism and the revolutionary spirit of decisive battle and victory, which are highly developed by such people, troops, and heroes. Such a net across the sky and earth, such a revolutionary spirit, have changed the balance of power on the South Vietnamese battlefield, so that it is not American imperialism that is stronger than the South Vietnamese people, but the South Vietnamese people who are stronger than American imperialism.
    The heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese people and their sons and daughters in defeating the American aggressors vividly confirm the truth that the people can create miraculous history and that the revolutionary spirit of the people can become an invincible material force. (Attached image)

    一个游击队员干掉二十个美国鬼子
    勇敢机智的游击队员阮撰，在一次战斗中，用地雷加手榴弹
  消灭了二十名美国鬼子。
    阮撰是广南省和旺县H乡的一位勇敢机智的游击队员，他参加了二十九次反击美国海军陆战队“扫荡”的战斗。有一次，他用地雷和手榴弹消灭了二十名美国鬼子。
    有一天，两连美国侵略军从岘港出发来H乡“扫荡”。阮撰细致地观察了地形，他估计，美国鬼子为了控制全村，一定会先爬上村头的小土丘。于是，他就在小土丘上埋下了地雷。
    天刚蒙蒙亮，美机扫射之后，就把美军空投下来。果然，美国侵略军争着从小土丘的右边往土丘上爬，要占领这块高地。于是，第一颗地雷爆炸了，三名美国鬼子当场送了命。
    未被炸死的美国鬼子慌忙滚下小土丘。早已埋伏在附近的阮撰便向敌军开枪射击，这些美国鬼子又转向小土丘的左边蜂拥逃命。但是阮撰埋下的第二颗地雷正在那里等着他们，轰隆一声，又有三个美国鬼子丧了命。
    美国直升飞机在空中扫射，企图抢走美军尸体。小土丘的顶部有一小块平地，阮撰早已预计敌人的直升飞机可能在这里着陆，早就在这里埋下了第三颗地雷。当美国鬼子把六具尸体抬上这块平地时，正好踏中了地雷，又丢了三条命。
    这时，敌机疯狂轰炸扫射，掩护剩下的美国鬼子逃命。但是，阮撰叫一位同伴截住敌人的退路，自己又埋伏到另外的地点去。他的同伴一枪就打死一个美国兵，吓得其余的敌军又仓惶掉头往后逃跑，正好走进阮撰埋伏的地点，阮撰一连投出三颗手榴弹，又结束了十一个美国鬼子的生命。
    编后
    南越人民战争的无穷威力，是怎样形成的？是从何而来的？人们从这一栏通讯中，也可以找到雄辩的答案。
    南越人民战争的无穷威力，正是由千百个幸福乡，由数以千计的陈文真单位，由无数阮德汇式和阮撰式的英雄战士，布下天罗地网，而形成的。它的无穷威力，正是来自这样的人民、部队和英雄们高度发挥的革命英雄主义和决战决胜的革命精神。这样的天罗地网，这样的革命精神，使得南越战场上的力量对比，发生了不是美帝国主义强大于南越人民，而是南越人民强大于美帝国主义的变化。
    南越人民及其子弟兵战胜美国侵略者的英雄事迹，生动地证实了人民能够创造奇迹般的历史，人民的革命精神可以变成不可战胜的物质力量的这个真理。（附图片）
