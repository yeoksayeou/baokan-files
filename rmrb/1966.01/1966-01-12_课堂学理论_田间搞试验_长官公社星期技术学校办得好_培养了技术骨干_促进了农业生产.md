    Learning Theory in the Classroom, Conducting Experiments in the Fields
    Changguan Commune's Weekend Technical School is Doing Well
    Cultivating Technical Backbones, Promoting Agricultural Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th – Last year, Changguan Commune in Ningjin County, Shandong Province, achieved a good harvest of 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu on its 14,000 mu of cotton fields, an increase of 34 jin per mu compared to 1964. Recently, cadres and commune members, in summarizing their experience in increasing production, all said that the Weekend Technical School deserves credit.
    The Weekend Technical School was established last spring in response to the needs of developing agricultural production. It uses technicians from the county agricultural bureau stationed in the commune as teachers, and absorbs teachers of technical courses from the commune's people-run schools. The students are teachers from people-run schools, technicians from production teams, and members of the production team's scientific research groups. They study for half a day every Sunday, and after returning to their teams, they actively impart scientific and technical knowledge to the commune members and guide them in applying it to production practice.
    The Weekend Technical School mainly studies planting and management techniques for crops such as cotton, corn, and wheat. It adopts the method of "one book inside the school, one plot of land outside the school; learning theory in the classroom, conducting experiments in the fields," combining learning with practice. Every time a new technology is learned, the theory is studied first, then experiments are conducted, and then it is promoted. Before cotton sowing, it was necessary to promote the advanced experience of warm water seed soaking, but the local masses had great concerns, fearing that the seeds would be scalded and would not germinate. The teachers and students of the Weekend Technical School took Changnan Brigade as a base and conducted experiments first. The effect of the experiment was very good, and the commune party committee immediately held an on-site meeting here to promote it. All brigades in the people-run schools also taught this scientific knowledge to the commune members and carried out experiments. In this way, most of the commune's cotton fields adopted the warm water seed soaking method, achieving timely sowing and full and strong seedlings. The old farmers, who originally had concerns, were also happy to see the thick and strong cotton seedlings, saying, "The old almanac is no longer valid; listening to the Party is never wrong." Other technologies, such as close planting and pest control, were also disseminated and promoted in this way.
    The Weekend Technical School has also made contributions in cultivating talent. Over the past year, all 54 students who participated in the study have become technical backbones of the production teams. Through them, another 254 technicians have been trained. Zhang Wanzhen, a technician from Changdong First Brigade, has become an expert in cotton planting through spare-time study. He can explain the theory and skillfully operate a whole set of techniques for cotton seed treatment, seedling setting, and pest control. Driven by the technicians and people-run school students in various teams, the scientific and technological level of the masses has been greatly improved. Currently, the Weekend Technical School of this commune is studying and promoting advanced production technologies such as winter wheat management.

    课堂学理论  田间搞试验
    长官公社星期技术学校办得好
    培养了技术骨干  促进了农业生产
    新华社济南十日电　山东省宁津县长官公社的一万四千亩棉花去年获得平均亩产皮棉八十斤的好收成，比一九六四年每亩增产三十四斤。最近，干部和社员们在总结增产经验时，都说应该给星期技术学校记上一功。
    星期技术学校是根据发展农业生产的需要，在去年春天举办的。它以县农业局驻公社的技术员为教师，吸收各大队的民办学校技术课教师参加学习。学员们是民校教师，也是生产队的技术员，同时又是生产队科学研究小组的成员。他们每星期日学习半天，回队后就积极向社员传授科学技术知识，并指导他们用于生产实际。
    星期技术学校主要学习棉花、玉米、小麦等农作物的种植管理技术。采取“校内一本书，校外一块田；课堂学理论，田间搞试验”边学边实践的办法。每学一项新技术，都是先学理论，再作试验，然后推广。棉花播种前，要推广温汤浸种的先进经验，可是当地群众顾虑很大，怕种子烫坏了不出芽。星期技术学校师生就以长南大队为基地，先行试验。试验的效果很好，公社党委立即在这里召开现场会议加以推广。各大队民校也都向社员传授了这项科学知识，并开展了试验。这样一来，全社的大部分棉田都采用了温汤浸种法，做到适时播种，苗全苗旺。原来有顾虑的老农，看到了又粗又壮的棉苗，也高兴地说：“老黄历看不得了，听党的话没错。”其他如密植、治虫等等技术，也是这样传播和推广开来的。
    星期技术学校还在培养人材方面作出了贡献。一年来，参加学习的五十四名学员，都成了生产队的技术骨干。通过他们，又培养了二百五十四名技术员。长东一大队技术员张万贞，通过业余学习，对棉花的种子处理、定苗、治虫等一整套技术，既能讲清理论，又能熟练操作，成了种棉能手。在各队技术员和民校学员的带动下，群众的科学技术水平有了很大提高。目前，这个公社的星期技术学校，正在研究推广小麦冬季管理等先进生产技术。
