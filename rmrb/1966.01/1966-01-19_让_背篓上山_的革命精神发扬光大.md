    Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of "Backpacks Up the Mountains"

    Editor's Note: "Backpack Stores" are revolutionary stores; the spirit of "backpacks up the mountains" is the thorough revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. It is a red banner for commercial workers to learn from, compare with, catch up with, help, and surpass each other. It is the common wealth of people on all fronts and in all walks of life. The Beijing Film Studio has timely brought it to the screen, filming the feature film "The Red Backpack," which is very meaningful. It not only meets the requirements of the broad masses of viewers, but also shows that literary and artistic workers who have studied Chairman Mao's works, adhered to the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, transformed their thinking, and went deep into life can create literary and artistic works that reflect the spirit of our great era relatively quickly. Although the film "The Red Backpack" still has some shortcomings, this path is correct, and it is the path that today's literary and artistic workers should take.

    Recently, cadres and workers in Beijing's supply and marketing departments held discussions on the educational significance of "The Red Backpack." Now, we are publishing a selection of their speeches below:

    让“背篓上山”的革命精神发扬光大
    编者按：“背篓商店”是革命化的商店；“背篓上山”的精神，是革命者全心全意为人民服务的彻底的革命精神。它是商业工作者比学赶帮超的一面红旗，它是各个战线，各行各业人们的共同财富。北京电影制片厂及时地把它搬上银幕，摄制了故事片《红色背篓》，是非常有意义的。它不仅满足了广大观众的要求，也说明文艺工作者学习了毛主席的著作，坚持了文艺为工农兵服务的方向，改造思想，深入生活，是可以比较迅速地创作出反映我们这伟大时代精神的文艺作品。电影《红色背篓》尽管还存在着一些缺点，但这条路子是走对了，这是今天的文艺工作者所应该走的道路。
    最近，北京市供销部门的干部、职工座谈《红色背篓》的教育意义，现在把他们的发言记录，选登一部分如下：
