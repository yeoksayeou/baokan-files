    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 17th – Radio Pathet Lao broadcast on the 17th that the U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys recently launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas of central and lower Laos.

    Since January 8th, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have dispatched the 12th Mobile Group to carry out "sweeps" in the Kho Tang and Ta Lei areas of Khammouane Province. They have also sent the 17th Mobile Group stationed in Ba Sang and two battalions of the 21st Mobile Group to operate in the western Kho Tang area. They also sent the 15th and 18th Mobile Groups and part of the 21st Mobile Group to conduct "sweeps" in the area seven kilometers south of Seno in Savannakhet Province, and to move towards Phalan, Kengkhan, Don Wei, and Xekonggang in Savannakhet Province.

    On January 6th, they also dispatched troops to launch large-scale "sweeps" in the Namsan and Bashe areas of Saravane Province.

    At the same time, American planes taking off from bases in Thailand and South Vietnam bombed areas around Lang Khang, Na She, Mahaxay, and Highways 8 and 12 in Khammouane Province day and night.

    During this period, the U.S. and its running dogs also constantly sent aircraft to bomb Upper Laos, especially areas around Phou Kout Mountain, Khang Khay, Muong Phou Khan, Ba Ka, Muang Xine, Muang Say, and Highway 6 in Sam Neua Province.

    The radio station said that the above-mentioned war-expanding actions of the U.S. and its running dogs are closely coordinated with the U.S. imperialism's actions of expanding the war of aggression against South Vietnam, intensifying provocations against Cambodia, and stepping up the sabotage of North Vietnam. It makes the situation in Laos more dangerous. The Lao people are determined to completely smash the above-mentioned adventurous actions of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 16th – According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 16th, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet troops and Thai armed forces have recently repeatedly invaded Cambodia from the ground, sea, and air.

    On the afternoon of January 4th, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet troops repeatedly opened fire on a village in the border area of Kandal Province, Cambodia, from within South Vietnamese territory. The South Vietnamese puppet armed forces only stopped firing after armed Cambodian villagers were forced to return fire in self-defense.

    On the evening of January 12th, a warship of the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet troops invaded Cambodian territorial waters off the coast of Kep and fled after being pursued by the Cambodian navy.

    On the afternoon of January 13th, an unidentified twin-engine aircraft from the Ha Tien area intruded into the airspace over Kep.

    From January 3rd to 5th, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet aircraft intruded into the airspace of Ratanakiri Province, Svay Rieng Province, Kampong Cham Province, and Kandal Province, Cambodia, eight times.

    From late at night on January 6th to the early morning of the 7th, the enemy used machine guns and rifles to strafe the mountain east of the post in Chi Neasa, Koh Kong Province, Cambodia. On the same morning, a Thai warship was found near Hale, Koh Kong Province. At 9:30 a.m. that day, two Thai jet fighters intruded into Cambodian airspace near Hale, Koh Kong Province.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 17th – According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 17th: On January 10th, about forty U.S.-South Vietnamese aircraft intruded into the airspace of O Yadao area, Andong Meas district, Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia, about four kilometers deep from the border. These aircraft strafed the forest around the forward positions of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. At the same time, South Vietnamese armed forces stationed at the Dak To post in South Vietnam fired mortars into Cambodian territory, some of which landed about one kilometer north of the O Yadao post of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.

    On January 15th, South Vietnamese armed forces repeatedly fired rifles and light machine guns at the provincial defense army post in Vong K, Kandal Province, Cambodia. The Cambodian provincial defense army at the above-mentioned post gave the enemy a forceful counterattack.

    Another message from the news agency on the 17th said that on January 3rd, 5th, and 6th, U.S.-South Vietnamese aircraft intruded into the airspace of Memot district, Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, three times. (Attached picture)

    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮电台十七日广播：美帝国主义及其老挝走狗最近向老挝中、下寮解放区发动了大规模的进攻。
    从一月八日以来，美帝国主义及其走狗派遣第十二机动团向甘蒙省科当、塔莱地区发动“扫荡”，它们还派出在巴桑的第十七机动团和第二十一机动团的两个营到科当西部地区进行活动。它们还派遣第十五、十八两个机动团和第二十一机动团的部分军队到沙湾拿吉省塞诺以南七公里的地区进行“扫荡”，并向沙湾拿吉省的法兰、更坎、当威、舍空岗等地移动。
    一月六日，它们还曾经派遣军队向巴色省南山、巴舍地区发动大规模“扫荡”。

    这家电台说，美国及其走狗的上述扩大战争的行动，是同美帝国主义扩大侵略越南南方战争、加紧对柬埔寨进行挑衅和破坏越南北方的战争行动紧密配合的。它使老挝局势更加危险。老挝人民决心彻底粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的上述冒险行动。

    一月十三日下午，来自河仙地区的一架未经辨明的双引擎飞机侵犯白马地区的上空。
    一月三日到五日，美国—南越傀儡飞机曾经八次侵入柬埔寨的腊塔纳基里省、柴桢省、磅湛省和干丹省的领空。
