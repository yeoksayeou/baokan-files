    Don't Lead the Team Astray
    After Daqing "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi became a team leader, his biggest concern was leading the team astray. This concern of his is what all leading cadres should be most concerned about.
    To lead the team in the right direction or to lead it astray, fundamentally speaking, is to lead the team onto the socialist road or onto the capitalist road. This is a fundamental question of direction. Of the thousands of things to do in leadership work, leading the team in the right direction is the most important.
    In financial and trade departments, very few people consciously lead workers to take the capitalist road. However, if the guiding ideology is not correct, it will foster capitalist management ideas and styles, as well as departmentalism and individualism. This, in reality, will lead workers away from the socialist track, which means leading the team astray. As Comrade Zhang Ruquan said in his letter, leading organs only focus on planned targets and not on politics. Some units engage in material incentives, and some units turn "convenience measures" into money-making measures, and so on. This is an example of leading the team astray.
    The fundamental guarantee for leading the team in the right direction is to give prominence to politics, always and in everything adhering to the principle of proletarian politics taking command, and of Mao Zedong Thought taking command. To truly achieve this, leading cadres and leading organs must take the lead in jumping out of the simple business circle.

    莫把队伍带歪了
    大庆“铁人”王进喜当了大队长以后，最担心的问题，是怕把队伍带歪了。他关心的这个问题，是所有领导干部要首先关心的问题。
    把队伍带正还是带歪，从根本上讲，就是把队伍带上社会主义道路，还是带上资本主义道路。这是个根本方向问题。领导工作千条万条，把队伍带正是第一条。
    在财贸部门，有意识地领导职工走资本主义道路的人，是微乎其微的。但是，如果指导思想不对头，却会助长资本主义的经营思想和经营作风，助长本位主义和个人主义，这在实际上就会使职工离开社会主义的轨道，也就是把队伍带歪了。象张汝泉同志来信所说的，领导机关只抓计划指标，不抓政治，有的单位就搞物质刺激，有的单位把“便民”措施搞成赚钱措施，等等。这就是把队伍带歪的一例。
    把队伍带正的根本保证，就是突出政治，时时、事事坚持无产阶级的政治挂帅，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅。要真正做到这一点，领导干部、领导机关就要带头跳出单纯业务圈子。
