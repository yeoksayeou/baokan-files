    Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao Sends Telegram to Xieng Det, Supreme Commander
    Warmly Congratulating the Lao People's Liberation Army on Army Day
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao today sent a telegram to Kantay Siphandone, Supreme Commander of the Lao People's Liberation Army, congratulating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army. The telegram reads as follows:
  To Kantay Siphandone, Supreme Commander of the Lao People's Liberation Army:
    On the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and in my own name, extend to you, and through you to all comrades-in-arms of the Lao People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle, the warmest festive congratulations.
    In the past year, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao People's Liberation Army, together with the Lao people and other patriotic armed forces, has continuously dealt heavy blows to the invading American aerial bandits and the Lao right-wing troops. They have made active contributions to safeguarding the independence and neutrality of their motherland and defending peace in Indochina and Asia.
    The extremely ferocious U.S. imperialism, attempting to escape its irretrievable defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam, is stepping up its bombing of the Lao liberated areas, colluding with the Lao right-wing forces to intensify military operations against the central and lower Laos liberated areas, and is preparing to expand the flames of aggression to the entire Indochina and China. This serious situation cannot but arouse the close attention of the Chinese people.
    The entire Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army resolutely support the Lao people and their armed forces in their just and patriotic anti-American struggle. And firmly believe that your struggle will win final victory!
    May the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Lao peoples and the armies of the two countries last forever.
    Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China

    林彪副总理兼国防部长致电西番顿最高指挥
    热烈祝贺老挝人民解放军建军节
    新华社十九日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪今天打电报给老挝人民解放军最高指挥坎代·西番顿，祝贺老挝人民解放军建军十七周年，电文如下：老挝人民解放军坎代·西番顿
  最高指挥：
    在老挝人民解放军建军十七周年的时候，我谨代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，并以我个人的名义，向你，并通过你向战斗在反美斗争前线的老挝人民解放军全体战友，致以最热烈的节日祝贺。
    一年来，老挝人民解放军在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，同老挝人民和其他爱国武装力量一起，不断给予入侵的美国空中强盗和老挝右派军队以沉重的打击。对维护自己祖国的独立和中立，保卫印度支那和亚洲的和平，作出了积极的贡献。
    穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，妄图摆脱它在侵略越南战争中无可挽回的失败局面，正在加紧轰炸老挝解放区，伙同老挝右派力量加紧对中、下寮解放区的军事行动，并且准备把侵略战火扩大到整个印度支那和中国。这种严重情况，不能不引起中国人民的密切注意。
    全体中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决支持老挝人民及其武装力量所进行的反美爱国正义斗争。并且坚信，你们的斗争必将赢得最后胜利！
    祝中、老两国人民和两国人民军队之间的兄弟友谊万古长青。
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长  林彪
    一九六六年一月十九日
