Title: I Want to Strive to Be a Revolutionary Mother

Edition: 6

    After reading the article "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Pounds" in one breath, I deeply felt that Comrades Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan are truly an extraordinary couple. When they heard the news of Jianhua's drowning, they also felt very heartbroken. However, they believe that class feeling and unity are more important. Such an inspiring event can only occur in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    I am the mother of three children. In the past, I was very afraid that my children would be wronged outside. When other people's children touched my children even slightly, I really felt heartbroken and very dissatisfied. Sometimes I even quarreled with others for my children, even to the point where I wouldn't speak to them afterwards.
    After reading this article, and comparing it to my past behavior, I feel that it is really wrong to quarrel and bicker with my revolutionary comrades and class brothers and sisters for the sake of my children. In the future, I must learn from Comrade Cheng Chunlan and her husband, and learn from their great revolutionary spirit of prioritizing class feeling, class unity, class interests, and the interests of the people. I must treat other people's children like my own children, and educate my children to be selfless and to unite well with other children, so that the roots of communist thought can take hold in their young minds. I want to strive to be a revolutionary mother. Jilin Zhang Fenglan

    我要争取当一个革命的母亲
    我一口气读完了《阶级感情千斤重》这篇文章，使我深深地感到：张永安和程春兰两位同志，真是一对极不平凡的夫妇。当他们听到建华被淹死的消息，也感到很心痛。但是，他们认为更重要的是阶级感情和团结。这样激动人心的事情，只有在共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国，才能出现这样动人的事情。
    我是三个孩子的母亲，以前生怕孩子在外面受了委屈，当别人的孩子稍一碰了我的孩子时，我真是心痛得不得了，心里非常不满意，有时还为孩子和别人闹别扭，甚至闹得以后连话都不跟人家说。
    读过这篇文章后，对比之下，感到为了孩子去与自己的革命同志、阶级弟兄姊妹争吵，闹别扭，是太不应该了。今后我一定要向程春兰夫妇学习，学习他们以阶级感情、阶级团结、阶级利益和人民利益为重的伟大革命精神，对待别人的孩子象对待自己的孩子一样，要教育孩子大公无私，和别的小朋友好好团结，在他们的幼小心灵上扎下共产主义思想的根。我要争取当一名革命的母亲。　吉林　张凤兰
