    What is the Daqing spirit? It is the revolutionary spirit of running enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary spirit of comprehensively implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the revolutionary spirit of creating our own path in socialist construction. Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, was originally a region with a very weak industrial base. In just a few years, it has developed into a new industrial region that has mastered a variety of new technologies and manufactured a large number of new products. Do they have any secrets? In fact, they have no secrets. Like the people of Daqing, they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive for progress, rely on their own efforts, greatly promote revolutionary spirit, and greatly oppose the Jia Gui mentality.
    Who is Jia Gui? He is a slave. The Peking Opera "Fa Men Si" vividly portrays his slavish face. Think about it, those who are superstitious about foreigners, superstitious about foreign books, just don't believe in the Chinese people themselves, look down on the working masses, this kind of self-abasement, the thought of not being able to stand up straight in front of foreigners and foreign books, isn't it very similar to the Jia Gui mentality? If we don't completely overthrow the Jia Gui mentality, how can we promote revolutionary spirit? How can we create and move forward?
    Greatly opposing the Jia Gui mentality is class struggle, using the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat to overthrow the slave mentality left over from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal system.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers in Jinzhou City have greatly broken down superstitious ideas, established great ambitions, dared to think and act, started from scratch, and fully embodied the Daqing spirit.
    Daqing is the most prominent example of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in industrial construction, and the Daqing spirit arises from this. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, in our great country, the Daqing spirit can sprout, grow, blossom, and bear fruit everywhere. Those enterprises that can truly creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought can become Daqing-style enterprises. It should be said that there can be Daqing everywhere in the country.
    To learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, and surpass Daqing, all regions and enterprises must proceed from their own realities. Jinzhou started with indigenous methods and small-scale operations (i.e., small factories, small equipment, small teams), and then developed new technologies and new products, striving to climb the peak of science and technology.
    To learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, and surpass Daqing, all regions and enterprises must firmly grasp a common point. This is to give prominence to politics. Comrade Mao Zedong said: Politics is the struggle of class against class. To give prominence to politics is to take class struggle as the key link and highlight class struggle. Daqing's growth process is full of struggles against various non-proletarian thoughts, and runs through a red line of class struggle. The development process of Jinzhou is also full of struggles against various non-proletarian thoughts, and runs through a red line of class struggle. This is the question of the direction of socialist enterprises. Daqing's experience proves this, and Jinzhou's experience also proves this.
    We propose to learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, and surpass Daqing in order to make efforts to grasp class struggle and give prominence to politics. As long as we consciously grasp this point, there is great hope and great potential for learning from Daqing, catching up with Daqing, and surpassing Daqing.
    The emergence of Daqing has solved the problem of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, comprehensively implementing the general line, and building a socialist industrial path. The emergence of Jinzhou further proves that this path is the only correct path for our country's industrialization; it also further proves that although Daqing is of a high standard in all aspects, it is not unattainable. The growth of Jinzhou, this Daqing-style emerging industrial region, is a major good news on our country's industrial front, encouraging us to learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, and surpass Daqing with a hundredfold of confidence, and strive to create more Daqing-style enterprises!

    全国都能有大庆
    什么是大庆精神？就是用毛泽东思想办企业的革命精神，就是全面贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的革命精神，就是在社会主义建设中创自己的道路的革命精神。辽宁省锦州市本来是个工业基础十分薄弱的地区，没有几年的工夫，已经发展成为掌握了多种新技术、制造了大量新产品的新兴工业地区。他们是不是有什么秘密呢？其实他们并没有什么秘密。他们就是象大庆人一样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋发图强，自力更生，大振革命精神，大反贾桂思想。
    贾桂是个什么人呢？是个奴才。京剧《法门寺》活画出他的一副奴才嘴脸。大家想想，那些迷信洋人，迷信洋书，就是不相信中国人自己，瞧不起工人群众，这一类妄自菲薄，在洋人、洋书面前直不起腰杆的思想，岂不是同贾桂思想很相象么？如果不彻底打倒贾桂思想，怎么能发扬革命精神呢？怎么能有所创造、有所前进呢？
    大反贾桂思想，就是阶级斗争，就是用无产阶级的革命精神，打倒半殖民地、半封建制度遗留下来的奴才思想。
    锦州市广大职工，在党的领导下，大破迷信思想，大立雄心壮志，敢想敢干，白手起家，充分体现了大庆精神。
    大庆，是在工业建设中活学活用毛泽东思想的最突出的典型，大庆精神由此产生。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在我们伟大的国家里，大庆精神到处可以发芽、滋长、开花、结果。那些企业真正能够活学活用毛泽东思想，那些企业就能够成为大庆式企业。应该说，全国各地都能有大庆。
    学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，各地区、各企业都必须从自己的实际出发。锦州就是土法上马，从三小作起（即小厂房、小设备、小队伍），发展了新技术、新产品，努力攀登科学技术高峰的。
    学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，各地区、各企业又必须牢牢抓住一个共同点。这就是突出政治。毛泽东同志说：政治就是阶级对阶级的斗争。突出政治，就是以阶级斗争为纲，突出阶级斗争。大庆的成长过程，充满着同各种非无产阶级思想的斗争，贯串着一条阶级斗争的红线。锦州的发展过程，同样充满着同各种非无产阶级思想的斗争，贯串着一条阶级斗争的红线。这是社会主义企业的方向问题。大庆的经验是这样证明的，锦州的经验也是这样证明的。
    我们提出学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，就是要在抓阶级斗争、突出政治这一点上下功夫。只要自觉地抓紧了这一点，学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，就大有希望，大有可为。
    大庆的出现，解决了活学活用毛泽东思想，全面贯彻总路线，建设社会主义工业道路的问题。锦州的出现，进一步证明了这条道路是我国工业化唯一正确的道路；也进一步证明了大庆在各个方面虽然都是高标准的，但并不是高不可攀的。锦州这个大庆式新兴工业地区的成长，是我国工业战线上的一大喜讯，鼓舞我们以百倍的信心，学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆，争取创造更多大庆式企业！
