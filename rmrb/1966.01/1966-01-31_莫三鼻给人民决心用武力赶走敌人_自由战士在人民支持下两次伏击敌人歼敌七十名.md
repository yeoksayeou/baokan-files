    The Mozambican People Determined to Drive Out the Enemy by Force
    Freedom Fighters, Supported by the People, Ambush the Enemy Twice, Eliminating Seventy Enemy Soldiers
    (Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 29th) The Provisional Action Committee of the Mozambican Revolutionary Committee recently issued a communique stating that the armed struggle of the Mozambican people for national liberation "will continue until the last Portuguese is driven out of our beloved motherland. If our generation does not complete this task, the next generation will."
    The communique, distributed by the Mozambican Revolutionary Committee delegation stationed in Ghana, stated that between October 21st and December 23rd of last year, guerrillas in the central region under the leadership of the Mozambican Revolutionary Committee eliminated eighteen Portuguese soldiers and wounded seven others in Zambu, Zambo, Ningo and Tete. During these combat operations, eight U.S.-made semi-automatic rifles were captured, three military trucks were destroyed, and one strategic military air base was burned down. In the first few weeks of October, twelve African soldiers of the Portuguese army deserted from the Portuguese army with their weapons.
    The communique pointed out that brutal repression cannot subdue the people, but rather strengthens their determination to fight. The communique said that the Mozambican people are advancing towards freedom and happiness, and the only path chosen by the people is the path of bloody struggle.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, 28th) The Mozambique Liberation Front headquarters announced here on the 27th in a communique that at the end of December 1965, Mozambican freedom fighters, with the support of the people, killed seventy Portuguese colonial soldiers in two ambush battles.
    On December 26th, Mozambican freedom fighters ambushed the road from the Mavaco post to Mataca, using landmines and rifles to destroy three trucks full of Portuguese colonial soldiers, killing forty-five colonial soldiers. Two days later, they ambushed five trucks full of enemy soldiers on the same road, destroying two trucks and killing twenty-five colonial soldiers.
    The communique said that Mozambican freedom fighters obtained information about enemy activities with the support of the people.
