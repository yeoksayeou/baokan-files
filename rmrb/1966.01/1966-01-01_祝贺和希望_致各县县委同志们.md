    Congratulations and Hopes
    ——To the County Committee Comrades of All Counties
    1966 has arrived! As this new year begins, we, with excited hearts, express our regards and congratulations to the county committee comrades fighting all over the country!
    Since our newspaper launched the discussion on the revolutionization of county committees last October, it has received enthusiastic support and active participation from county committee comrades and the broad masses of readers in various regions. As of now, the editorial department has received nearly 1,500 submissions from 781 counties and cities, including submissions written by approximately 300 county party secretaries and county heads. We feel infinitely close when we edit these submissions coming from all corners of our great motherland. These submissions fully reflect the revolutionary enthusiasm of county committee comrades in various regions in building a new socialist countryside, and seriously explore various issues related to revolutionization. Everyone is working hard to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought as the "arrow" to shoot the "target" of the revolutionization of county committee leadership, exchange experiences, inspire each other, and advance together.
    The new year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. This will be a year in which the people of our country hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stride forward on the road of revolutionization. We must strive for a greater development in agriculture, increase the production of grain and cotton, develop diversified operations, and actively combat disasters and prepare for famine. The key to completing this major task is to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further realize the revolutionization of county committee leadership, grasp revolution, promote production, and promote the continued, healthier, and more sustainable development of the agricultural production upsurge.
    After the New Year, regarding the discussion on the revolutionization of county committees, we plan to further expand the discussion on issues such as the relationship between politics and production, how to correctly summarize experience, the relationship between the Party's policies and the interests of the masses, and creatively studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works. We hope everyone will continue to actively participate in this discussion.

    祝贺和希望
    ——致各县县委同志们
    一九六六年来到了！在这新的一年开始的时候，我们怀着兴奋的心情，向战斗在全国各地的县委同志们，表示慰问和祝贺！
    自从去年十月本报开展关于县委革命化的讨论以后，得到各地县委同志和广大读者的热烈支持和积极参加。截至目前为止，编辑部共收到来自七百八十一个县市的近一千五百件来稿，其中有约三百位县委书记、县长写的稿件。我们编辑这些来自我们伟大祖国的四面八方的来稿的时候，感到无限亲切。这些来稿充分反映了各地县委同志们建设社会主义新农村的革命热情，认真探讨了有关革命化的各种问题。大家都在努力学习用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射县委领导革命化之“的”，交流经验，互相启发，共同前进。
    新的一年，是我国第三个五年计划的第一年。这将是我国人民更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命化道路上阔步前进的一年。我们要努力争取农业有个更大的发展，增产粮食和棉花，发展多种经营，积极抗灾备荒。完成这项重大任务的关键，是活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步实现县委领导的革命化，抓革命，促生产，推进农业生产高潮继续更加健康地、持续地发展。
    新年以后，关于县委革命化的讨论，我们准备比较集中地就政治和生产的关系，如何正确总结经验，党的政策和群众利益的关系和活学活用毛泽东同志著作等问题，进一步展开，希望大家继续积极参加这个讨论。——编　者
