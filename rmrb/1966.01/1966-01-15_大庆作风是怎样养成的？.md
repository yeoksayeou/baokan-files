    Editor's Note: The Daqing spirit is the concrete manifestation of the Three-Eight Style. It is the product of Daqing people's creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.
    To cultivate a revolutionary spirit, there must be a standard. This standard is the Three-Eight Style of Work proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, consisting of three sentences and eight characters. The three sentences are: a firm and correct political orientation, an arduous and simple work style, and flexible and mobile strategies and tactics. The eight characters are: unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. The Three-Eight Style, combined with Daqing's reality, became the "Three Honesties," "Four Strictnesses," and "Four Samenesses," centered on rigor, meticulousness, accuracy, and ruthlessness.
    The Daqing spirit embodies the combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit, reflects the requirements of modern production and construction in the petroleum industry, and also reflects the revolutionary aspirations of the vast number of workers.
    Daqing people attach great importance to cultivating a revolutionary spirit. The key to cultivating a revolutionary spirit lies in the leaders first adhering to a revolutionary style, setting an example in everything, strictly demanding everything, matching words with deeds, and implementing it from top to bottom, person by person.
    A good revolutionary style, like revolutionary thought, is invisible and intangible. However, once it is grasped by the broad masses and everyone cultivates a good style, it will transform into a powerful material force. The unit with a good style becomes a revolutionary melting pot, where all new elements added will change, inherit the good style, and transform into a new look. Such a style, one person leading another, one unit leading another, brings out the entire team. A good style is like a relay baton, which can be passed down from generation to generation. Cultivating a style is cultivating the fighting power of the team.
    Daqing has an invisible and immense force, which is the Daqing spirit. The style is invisible and intangible, but it is indeed objectively existing and immediately infects you.
    Perhaps the power of this style can be perceived from certain phenomena, such as: the well site is flat and tidy, the warehouse is neat and orderly, the oil wellhead devices, separators, and other equipment are clean, there is no oil pollution on the well site, and no debris in the well...; but these do not fully represent the full power of their style.
    The Daqing spirit is the concrete manifestation of the Three-Eight Style. Daqing people cultivated a revolutionary style with a revolutionary spirit. They do not engage in formalism but emphasize pragmatism. They have always emphasized establishing the "Three Honesties," "Four Strictnesses," and "Four Samenesses" centered on rigor, meticulousness, accuracy, and ruthlessness.
    The "Three Honesties" are: being honest people, speaking honest words, and doing honest deeds.
    The "Four Strictnesses" are: strict requirements, strict organization, serious attitude, and strict discipline.
    The "Four Samenesses" are: working the same way at night and during the day, working the same way in bad weather and good weather, working the same way whether leaders are present or not, and working the same way whether someone is inspecting or not.
    These have been accepted by the vast number of workers and become conscious actions.
    With a good style, there is fighting power, and people can act vigorously and move at the sound of the wind. No matter what tough or difficult battles are fought, they cannot be dragged down or defeated; no matter where they go, they will not frown or weaken; whether it is a team, a group, or an individual, whether performing tasks alone or acting collectively, they are reliable and trustworthy. A good style can play a role that leadership and production management systems cannot fully play. With a good style, even if there are some backward people in the team, they can be led well.

    Combating "Old Habits" is a Manifestation of Class Struggle
    Why is it necessary to cultivate a style centered on rigor, meticulousness, accuracy, and ruthlessness? This is because some leading cadres originally had the problem of "one crudeness, two laxities, and three not ruthlessness"; some technical cadres originally had the problem of "rough estimation, reckless calculation, and grand averaging"; and some workers originally had some problems of "carelessness, compromise, and indifference." These problems are all habitual forces; only by gradually overthrowing them can a new revolutionary style be established.
    Combating "old habits" is essentially a manifestation of class struggle. In the struggle, one must be ruthless until they are overthrown and cannot be soft-hearted.
    Ruthless opposition to old habits must emphasize politics. In 1961, a drilling team drilled a substandard well. Although the well was substandard, it could still produce oil with some compromise. Unexpectedly, the oilfield leadership made a decision: resolutely plug the well! This worried everyone. The well was drilled by everyone, and the leaders, workers, and technicians had put in so much effort for it, and the country had spent a lot of money. Using it reluctantly, it seemed that all this could be compensated for, and oil was still scarce in the country at that time! Plugging it would not all be a "waste"? However, these reasons could not shake the leader's determination in the slightest. Of course, the leadership would never easily plug it and be done with it; their purpose was to use this abandoned well as a negative example to let all the workers forever remember this lesson. For this matter, they held several meetings of tens of thousands of people, thoroughly explained the great political significance of developing the oilfield at a high level and high speed, and mobilized the masses to thoroughly expose all kinds of "old habits," causing many people to sweat on their foreheads and tears in their eyes. From then on, one high-quality straight well after another was continuously drilled, with the inclination decreasing from five degrees, four degrees, three degrees to two degrees, one degree, and half a degree. The proletariat's excellent style condensed into countless high-quality oil wells, providing ever-greater contributions to the country.
    Revolutionary style is generated in the struggle against habitual forces. Habitual forces are often taken for granted and not noticed. Without revolutionary consciousness, it is difficult to overthrow them. Once, Comrade Wang Jinxi went to the well site to inspect work and immediately saw a worker wiping the machine with oil and then wiping his oily hands on his body. Wang Jinxi felt that this was a bad habit and should be changed, so he criticized it. The worker said: "The first day I came to the well site, I saw my master doing it this way." Wang Jinxi also found the master and criticized him for not training his apprentice well. The master said: "When I was an apprentice, I watched you do it this way too." When Wang Jinxi heard this, he immediately confessed his old habits to the workers: "You must never learn this bad habit from me." After that, he paid attention to overcoming his old habits and old problems at all times and in all places. He often told the workers about this matter. They also listed old habits on the wall, posted them on the head of the bed or in the duty room, with leaders inspecting and the masses supervising, subtracting one for each one changed and adding one for each one committed, leaving no room for old habits to exist.

    "Rigor, Meticulousness, Accuracy, Ruthlessness"
    The first of "Rigor, Meticulousness, Accuracy, Ruthlessness" is "Rigor." "Rigor" is the objective requirement of a modern enterprise. "Rigor" means being serious. Being serious means keeping a very tight grip on work, not being ambiguous at all, not compromising at all, never being satisfied with the level already achieved, and never forgiving oneself for mistakes. With a rigorous style, work is organized, of good quality, and meets specifications.
    "Rigor" must also be "Meticulous." Meticulousness means grasping the work in detail. In running the petroleum industry, there is a lot of underground work, a lot of high-temperature and high-pressure work, a lot of hidden projects, and many types of work; if it is not "Meticulous," things will be messed up and mistaken.
    "Accuracy" means grasping the work accurately. To grasp it accurately, one must see it accurately. If the problem is not seen accurately, one will hesitate, be unable to make a decision, or make a wrong decision and miss the big event.
    Once the problem is grasped accurately, it must also be "Ruthless." Ruthless means "grasping it tightly," grasping it to the end, and never letting go.
    Where is Daqing's "Rigor, Meticulousness, Accuracy, Ruthlessness" manifested? Comrades who come to Daqing can easily find hundreds or thousands of examples. Here are a few excerpts:
    Once, machine room worker Hu Zongzheng took over Liang Jingrong's shift and found that one of the six screws on the gearbox was missing, and Liang Jingrong had replaced it with another one. Hu Zongzheng said: "This won't do!" Liang Jingrong must find the original screw, and if it is broken, he must also bring it to see. Because, if that screw is lost into the gears, it will cause a major accident. Where can such a small screw be found? But it must be found. Liang Jingrong did not know how much effort he spent, but he finally found the screw from the crack in the floor, and that was the end of the matter. ...
    One evening, the "Hard Bone" motorcade completed its day's intense task and returned full of victory. The parking lot suddenly became lively. Squad leader Zhang Tingdong especially went to the youth driver Xiao Song's car to see how his "routine maintenance" was going. Xiao Song said with confidence: "The car does not break down when it goes out, and it is five-good when it comes back." Zhang Tingdong heard that something was not right, so he climbed under the car and carefully checked, and found that the large box screw was loose by half a turn, and asked Xiao Song to tighten it. Xiao Song did not think so, he thought: the car is always bumpy, how can there not be a half turn or a full turn loose? Zhang Tingdong said to him: "The routine maintenance system is the basis for managing vehicles well, and half a turn of difference is not allowed during implementation. If one corner of the foundation of a tall building is not strong, there is a risk of collapse. Half a turn of difference will also corrupt the style, and tightening half a turn is for thousands of miles of driving in the future!"
    The technical cadres of the Oilfield Development Research Office once drew a drawing to report to the leaders of the oilfield headquarters, omitting six oil wells the size of millet grains. Later, when this was discovered, the director of the research office and the party branch secretary led everyone to check for two days. In order to make everyone remember this lesson, they decided to destroy the drawing. They cut the drawing into several small pieces, distributed one piece to each person in the office, wrote their own shortcomings on it, and kept it. After that, they used this day as a "memorial day" every month to carefully check their own shortcomings in their work once.

    Using High Standards to Guide the Masses to Look Forward
    How can the vast number of workers consciously achieve the requirements of "Rigor, Meticulousness, Accuracy, Ruthlessness"? First of all, there must be a clear purpose. All work must have a high standard and cannot be "lowered to seek." The workers said: "To maintain a rigorous, meticulous, accurate, and ruthless style, we must eliminate low standards as 'enemies.'"
    At the beginning of the Daqing battle, the oilfield leaders proposed high standards that could be achieved through effort. For example, in drilling quality, the general well inclination is allowed to be within five degrees, which does not affect production, and foreign countries also stipulate this. Daqing proposed not to exceed three degrees, and a little bit worse would not do. The drilling quality was like this, and so was other work.
    In order to achieve high standards, the workers of Daqing's General Machinery Factory once discussed the following question: "Does obtaining a certificate of conformity count as completing the task?" At first, some people said: "The sign that a repairman has completed the task is the certificate of conformity." Someone objected: "Even if we get a certificate of conformity, if our car repair quality is not high, it cannot be considered completing the task." Someone else said: "If a certificate of conformity is issued and the quality is found to be bad later, that is the problem of the quality inspector." Someone else retorted: "If we try every means to fool the inspector in order to obtain a certificate of conformity, can we blame the inspector?" In the end, the vast majority of people realized: "We are doing machine repair for the revolution, to ensure that the 'front line' does a good job in production, and we cannot only strive for a certificate of conformity. Of course, we still need a certificate of conformity, but it must be a 'genuine' certificate of conformity, not a careless, compromising, or passable certificate of conformity, let alone a fraudulent certificate of conformity."
    Serving the people is infinite, and high standards are developing. Daqing's work standards have been improving year by year. For example, in 1961, the oilfield leaders proposed "If the quality is not up to standard, it will be torn down and rebuilt"; in 1962, after having a certain ideological foundation, they proposed "seeking more in quality, seeking faster in quality, and seeking savings in quality"; in 1963, they proposed "one-time success in quality"; in 1964, they further proposed "all projects have excellent quality in every item." One requirement at a time, guiding the masses to always look forward. When the work is done well, a good style is gradually cultivated.

    Revolutionary Consciousness is the Basis of Revolutionary Style
    A comrade from another place who came to Daqing told us: "We studied here two years ago, and after seeing these things, we summarized them into the two words 'strictness' and did the same when we went back. As a result, it was 'strict' in form, but not strict in practice; a few people were 'strict,' but most people were not 'strict,' and instead, a lot of trouble and formalism arose. Now we understand that Daqing's style is not a form, but is firmly based on revolutionary consciousness. Without consciousness, there is no 'strictness'; without strong political and ideological work, there is no consciousness."
    That is indeed the case. Here, if there is a slight mistake in production, why does everyone stand up and offer opinions? Why is everyone "discussing it"? Why does everyone regard it as a matter of "revolutionary style"? This is because the majority of people are consciously producing and working for the revolution, and it is based on the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, not "punished" by punishmentism, not "ordered" by commandism. Revolutionary consciousness is the basis of revolutionary style, this is the conclusion of the Daqing people.
    What are the conscious requirements? The Daqing people say: "We must be responsible to the people for a lifetime"; "We must not harbor personal selfish thoughts"; "We are completely for the liberation of the people"; "We must work thoroughly for the interests of the people."
    The implementation of the system mainly depends on consciousness. It is not enough to rely solely on inspection. The personal experience of Wang Shufang, a oil extraction worker of the First Oil Production Command, can well illustrate this point. Last January, her father came to see her from another place, and the father and daughter had not seen each other for three years. One day, she was on duty clearing wax, and her father ran to the well and called out "Shufang." She looked up and, oh my, Dad is here. Her mood was very excited and contradictory. According to the regulations, it is forbidden to speak when clearing wax. Now, "should I speak or not"? She thought: "If a PLA soldier does not eliminate the last enemy on the battlefield, he cannot be considered a complete victory. Now there are still 100 meters of steel wire in the well, and if I stop, I will lose the wax scraper and destroy the system." She did not answer her father. Her father waited anxiously and left. After Wang Shufang got off work, her father was still angry, saying: "What did you call me for, you don't recognize me anymore." After her father understood the truth, he smiled and said: "You Daqing people are really strict!"

### 大庆作风是怎样养成的？

专栏：

    大庆作风是怎样养成的？
    编者按：大庆的作风就是三八作风的具体化。它是大庆人活学活用毛泽东思想的产物。
    培养革命作风，要有个标准。这个标准就是毛泽东同志提出的三句话八个字的三八作风。三句话是：坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术。八个字是：团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。三八作风同大庆的实际相结合，就成为以严、细、准、狠为中心的“三老”、“四严”、“四个一样”的作风。
    大庆的作风，体现了革命精神和科学精神的结合，反映了石油工业现代化生产和建设的要求，也反映了广大职工的革命愿望。
    大庆人非常重视培养革命作风。培养革命作风的关键，在于领导者首先要坚持革命的作风，处处以身作则，处处严格要求，说到做到，从上到下，人人实行。
    革命的好作风和革命的思想一样，看不见，摸不着。但是，一旦被广大群众掌握住了，人人都养成了好作风，那就会转化成为强大的物质力量。那个单位作风好，那个单位就成为一个革命的大熔炉，一切新的成分加进去都会起变化，接过好作风，变成新样子。这样的作风，一个人带一个人，一个单位带一个单位，就把整个队伍带出来了。好作风有如接力棒，可以一代传一代，世世代代传下去。培养作风就是培养队伍的战斗力
    大庆有一种无形的巨大力量，这就是大庆作风。作风是看不见、摸不到的，但它确实是客观存在，一下子就使你受到感染。
    也许可以从某些现象上觉察到这种作风的力量，比如：井场外平平整整，仓库里整整齐齐，采油井口装置、分离器及其它设备干干净净，井场无油污，井下无落物……；但是这一些远远不能表现他们的作风的全部威力。
    大庆的作风，就是三八作风的具体化。大庆人用革命的精神培养了革命的作风。他们不搞形式，而讲求实干。他们一直强调树立以严、细、准、狠为中心的“三老”、“四严”、“四个一样”的作风。
    “三老”是当老实人，说老实话，做老实事。
    “四严”是严格的要求，严密的组织，严肃的态度，严明的纪律。
    “四个一样”是黑夜和白天干工作一个样，坏天气和好天气干工作一个样，领导不在场和领导在场干工作一个样，没有人检查和有人检查干工作一个样。
    这些，已经被广大职工接受，成为自觉的行动。
    有了好作风，就有了战斗力，人们就能雷厉风行，闻风而动。不管打什么硬仗、恶仗，都拖不垮、打不烂；不管到什么地方，都眉不皱、腿不软；不管是一个队、一个组还是一个人，不管是单独执行任务还是集体行动，都是靠得住，信得过。好作风，可以起领导上和生产管理制度上不能完全起的作用。有了好作风，即使队伍中有些落后的人，也能够带好。反“老毛病”是阶级斗争的一种表现
    为什么要培养以严、细、准、狠为中心的作风呢？这是因为，在某些领导干部中原来存在着“一粗、二松、三不狠”的毛病；在某些技术干部中，原来存在着“粗估、冒算、大平均”的毛病；在某些工人中原来也有一些“马虎、凑合、不在乎”的毛病。这些毛病，都是一些习惯势力；只有逐步把它们打倒，才能建立革命的新风。
    反“老毛病”，实质上也是阶级斗争的一种表现。在斗争中，一定要心狠，直到把它们反掉，而不能手软。
    狠反老毛病要突出政治。一九六一年，一个钻井队打了一口不合格的井。井虽然不合格，但可以凑合出油。谁想到，油田领导做了决定：坚决把这口井填死！这可把大家急坏了。井，是大家打出来的，领导同志、工人、技术人员不知为它付出了多少辛苦，国家花了很多的钱。勉强用下去，这一切似乎都可以得到补偿，石油当时还是国家所缺少的呀！把它填死，不是全都“浪费”了吗？可是，这种种理由，丝毫动摇不了领导的决心。当然，领导上决不会轻易把它填死完事，他们的目的是把这口废井作为一个反面教材，让全体职工永远记住这个教训。为了这件事情，开了几天上万人的大会，把高水平、高速度地开发油田的伟大政治意义讲了个透，发动群众把各种各色的“老毛病”揭了个透，搞得不少人头上出汗，眼中流泪。从此以后，一口口高质量的直井就不断打了出来，斜度从五度、四度、三度一直下降到二度、一度、半度。无产阶级的过硬作风凝成无数高质量的油井，为国家提供了越来越大的贡献。
    革命作风在同习惯势力作斗争中产生。习惯势力常常是习以为常，察觉不到的。没有革命的自觉性，很难反掉它。有一次，王进喜同志到井场检查工作，一眼看到一个工人用油去擦机器，然后将满手油污擦在身上。王进喜觉得这是个坏作风，应该改掉，就提出了批评。这个工人说：“我第一天到井场，看见师傅就是这样做的。”王进喜又找来师傅，批评他没有带好徒弟。师傅说：“当初我学徒的时候，看着你也是这样做的。”王进喜听到这句话，马上向工人检讨自己的老毛病：“你们千万别跟我学这种坏作风。”此后，他随时随地注意克服自己的老习惯、老毛病。他经常跟工人讲这件事。他们还把老毛病列榜，贴在床头上或值班房里，领导检查，群众监督，改一条减一条，犯一条加一条，使老毛病没有容身之地。“严、细、准、狠”
    “严、细、准、狠”，头一个是“严。”“严”是现代化企业的客观要求。“严”就是认真。认真，就是对工作卡得非常紧，一点也不含糊，一点也不迁就，永远不满足已经达到的水平，有了差错，决不原谅自己。有了严的作风，工作就有条理、讲质量、合规格。
      “严”，还要“细”。细就是工作抓得细致。办石油工业，地下作业多，高温高压作业多，隐蔽工程多，工种多，如果不“细”，就会搞乱搞错。
    “准”，就是工作抓得准。要抓得准，就要看得准。问题看不准，就会犹豫不决，下不了决心，或者下了错误决心误了大事。
    问题抓准了，还要“狠”，狠就是“抓得紧”，一抓到底，毫不放松。
    大庆的“严、细、准、狠”表现在哪里呢？到大庆的同志可以很容易地找到上百成千的例子。这里可以摘引几个：
    有一次，机房工人胡宗正接梁景荣的班，发现减速箱上的六个螺丝丢了一个，是梁景荣另找了一个配上了。胡宗正说：“这可不行！”一定要梁景荣把原来的那个螺丝找来，如果坏了，也要拿来看看。因为，如果那个螺丝丢到齿轮里去就会造成大事故。一个小小的螺丝上哪里找去呢？但是，非找不可。梁景荣不知费了多大力气，到底把那个螺丝从地板缝里找了出来，这才完了这回事。……
    一天傍晚，“硬骨头”车队完成了全天的紧张的任务，满载着胜利回来了。停车场上顿时热闹起来。小队长张廷栋特意到青年司机小宋的车旁，看他“例行保养”搞得怎样。小宋满有把握地说：“车子开出去不抛锚，开回来就是五好。”张廷栋听这话有点不对头，就爬到车底下细心检查，发现大箱螺丝松了半扣，要小宋拧紧。小宋不以为然，他认为：汽车这玩艺成天颠簸，还有不松个一扣半扣的？张廷栋对他说：“例行保养制度是管好车辆的基础，执行时决不允许有半扣之差。万丈高楼的基础有一角不牢，就有坍倒的危险。半扣之差，也会败坏作风，紧了半扣，正是为了今后万里行车！”
    油田开发研究室的技术干部，有一次画了一张向油田总部领导汇报的图纸，漏掉了象小米粒大小的六口油井。后来发现了这件事，研究室主任和党支部书记带领大家一起检查了两天。为了使每个人记住这个教训，大家决定毁掉这张图纸。他们把这张图纸剪成若干小块，分给全室每人一块，把自己的缺点写在上面，保存起来。以后，每月把这一天当做“纪念日”来过，认真检查一次自己工作上的缺点。用高标准引导群众向前看
    怎样使广大职工自觉地实现“严、细、准、狠”的要求呢？首先得有明确的目的性。一切工作都要有一个高标准，不能“降格以求”。工人说：“要保持严、细、准、狠的作风，就要把低标准当‘敌人’消灭。”
    大庆会战一开始，油田领导就提出了经过努力可以实现的高标准。例如，打井质量，一般井斜允许五度以内，这样并不影响生产，外国也是这样规定的。大庆则提出不超过三度，差一点也不行。打井质量是这样，其它工作也是这样。
    为了实现高标准，大庆的总机厂职工曾经讨论过这样一个问题：“拿到合格证算不算完成任务？”开始，有人说：“修理工完成任务的标志就是合格证。”有人反对：“即便拿到了合格证，如果我们修车质量不高，还不能算完成任务。”又有人说：“发了合格证以后，再发现质量不好，那是质量检验员的问题。”又有人反驳道：“要是为了拿到合格证，千方百计糊弄检验员，那能怪检验员吗？”最后，绝大多数人都认识到：“我们搞机修是为了革命，为了保证‘前线’搞好生产，不能只为合格证而奋斗。当然，合格证还是要，但一定要‘货真价实’的合格证，不要马虎、凑合、过得去的合格证，更不要弄虚作假的合格证。”
    为人民服务是无限的，高标准是发展的。大庆的工作标准逐年有所提高。例如，一九六一年，油田领导提出“质量不合格的就推倒重来”；一九六二年，在有了一定思想基础之后，又提出“好中求多，好中求快，好中求省”；一九六三年，提出了“质量一次成功”；一九六四年，进一步提出“项项工程质量全优”。一步一个要求，引导群众始终向前看。工作做好了，好作风也逐渐养成了。革命自觉是革命作风的基础
    有位外地来大庆的同志对我们说：“我们前两年在这里学习，看了这些以后，归纳成‘从严’二字，回去就照办了。结果，形式上‘严’，实际上严不了；少数人‘严’，多数人‘严’不了，反而出了不少麻烦，也出了形式主义。现在我们才懂得：大庆的作风不是形式，而是牢固地建立在革命自觉的基础上的。没有自觉，就没有‘从严’；没有过硬的政治思想工作，又没有自觉。”
    确是这样。这里生产上出了一点差错，为什么人人挺身而出、提出意见？为什么大家“议论纷纷”？为什么大家都把它看成“革命作风”问题？这是由于多数人是自觉地为革命而生产、而工作，是靠群众的革命自觉，不是靠惩办主义“惩办”出来的，不是靠命令主义“命令”出来的。革命自觉是革命作风的基础，这是大庆人的结论。
    自觉的要求是什么呢？大庆人说：“要为人民负责一辈子”；“不能怀有个人的杂念”；“完全是为着解放人民”；“彻底地为人民的利益工作”。
    执行制度，主要靠自觉。单靠检查，是不够的。第一采油指挥部采油工王淑芳同志的亲身经历很能说明这个问题。去年一月，她父亲从外地来看望她，父女已有三年没见面了。一天，她正在值班清腊，父亲跑到井上，叫了一声“淑芳”。她抬头一看，哎呀，爸爸来了。她的心情很激动，也很矛盾。按制度规定，清腊时不准说话。现在是“说话呢还是不说话呢”？她想到：“一个解放军战士在战场上打到最后一个敌人，如果不把他消灭掉，就不能算彻底胜利。现在钢丝在井里还有一百米，停下来就要丢掉刮腊片，就要破坏制度”。她没有同父亲答话。父亲等急了，走了。王淑芳下班后，她的父亲还在生气，说：“你喊我干什么，你都不认我啦。”等到父亲了解了真相以后，笑着说：“你们大庆真严啊！”
