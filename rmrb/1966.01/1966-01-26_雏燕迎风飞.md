    The small group meeting broke down, and everyone was discussing it. Some said that the small group leader, Elder Tan, had too fiery a temper and shouldn't have stopped Little Sun from working the machine; others said that the little girl's stubbornness was also to blame. The leader wanted her to switch to a better machine, which was to help her solve difficulties, but she stubbornly refused to switch. What else could be done but to stop her machine?
    The incident occurred in Weaving Group B, Team One of the Shaanxi First Wool Textile Factory. This group is a well-known advanced group in the whole factory. However, since switching to weaving a new variety last September, the quality suddenly declined. In October, although the situation improved somewhat, progress was not great. At a pre-shift meeting, someone suggested that since switching to the new variety, some machines had become "old clunkers," particularly difficult to manage. It would be best to have the "technical aces" in the group take care of these old clunkers. This suggestion was supported by many people. Everyone thought that Little Sun's "107" machine was a daunting "old clunker" that produced a relatively high amount of substandard cloth. She should be assigned a different machine.
    To be honest, Elder Tan initially hadn't thought about giving Little Sun a different machine. He felt that this little girl was willing to study hard and practice diligently, and if properly cultivated, she would become a good hand. But the immediate problem was that product quality couldn't be guaranteed, and the "107" machine was producing a relatively high amount of substandard cloth. So, when others suggested switching Little Sun's machine, Elder Tan agreed. Unexpectedly, Little Sun insisted on not switching. This made Elder Tan very angry. He said to Little Sun:
    "If you don't switch machines, don't work the machine."
    "If I don't work the machine, I don't work the machine. I'm not switching anyway." The stubborn Little Sun didn't back down either. The small group meeting broke up on bad terms.
    Why did Little Sun insist on not switching machines? She had her own thoughts. Last spring, the factory launched a vigorous production upsurge, and the sisters all increased the number of machines they were tending. Coincidentally, Little Sun's machine broke down at this time, keeping her so busy that she couldn't attend to everything, and the quality was consistently low. The master workers in the group switched machines with her. She felt much more relaxed after switching to a good machine, but she didn't feel right in her heart. Later, she studied the article *On the Chongqing Negotiations*. Chairman Mao said: "We work and struggle to overcome difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we must go; that is what makes a good comrade." She thought that switching machines was pushing the difficulty to others, which was actually an evasion of difficulties and a manifestation of not daring to struggle. If things continued like this, how could an apprentice worker become a skilled worker? Besides, apprentice workers also had a part to play in producing more and better products for the country! This time, she knew that tending the "107" machine would be very difficult, but she wanted to get through this challenge.
    Little Sun is nineteen years old this year. She lost her parents when she was very young and grew up under the care and nurturing of the Party. This has developed in her a "go-against-the-wind" character. Since entering the factory, under the help of the Party and Youth League organizations, she has joined the Communist Youth League, which has added new content to her "go-against-the-wind" character. Her heart holds a passion for weaving for the revolution. Precisely because of this, she spent several times more time than others diligently practicing her skills, and in a very short period of time, she learned how to operate the shuttle box, patrol the machines, change shuttles, tie knots... Her skills improved rapidly, and she was finally rated as a superior level worker, just like the master workers.
    After Little Sun was suspended from working her machine, she became anxious and immediately ran to Comrade Zhang Suzhen, the Party branch secretary, asking to be allowed to tend the "107" machine. Zhang Suzhen listened to Little Sun's views very carefully, agreed to her request, and said: "Your idea is very good, and the branch fully supports you." Zhang Suzhen then said: "Why didn't you talk about these ideas at the small group meeting? If you had said it earlier, things wouldn't have become so strained."
    "So many things are ruined by my stubborn nature. I really hate myself," Little Sun said. "I'm going to go to the group leader to make a self-criticism!"
    When everyone understood Little Sun's thoughts, they all actively supported her, and the master workers also took the initiative to help her with ideas and solutions. A few days later, the "107" machine finally produced good cloth, and the old clunker was finally subdued.
    Recently, the factory has innovated a new type of loom and wants to trial produce a batch of products. It seems that there will be many difficulties. However, Little Sun has stepped forward to participate in the trial production. Her slender figure flashes in front of this machine one moment and appears behind that machine the next. Her feet step lightly as she patrols between the looms, looking like a young swallow just out of its nest, bravely flying forward against the wind.

    雏燕迎风飞
    裴秀升
    小组会开崩了，大家议论纷纷。有的说小组长老谭的脾气太暴躁，不该停止小孙值车；有的说也怪那小姑娘的性子太犟，组长要她换台好车，是帮助她解决困难，她却硬是不换，不停她的车怎么办？
    事情发生在陕西第一毛纺织厂织布乙班一组。这个小组是全厂有名的先进小组。但是自从去年九月换织一种新品种后，质量突然下降，十月份，情况虽说有所好转，但进展不大。在一次班前会上，有人提出，自从改织新品种以来，有些机车简直成了“老爷车”，特别难侍候，最好能把组里的“技术尖子”换上来看这些老爷车。这个意见得到很多人的支持。大家认为，小孙的“107”号车就是一台叫人望而生畏的“老爷车”，出的降等布比较多。应该给她换车。
    实在说，老谭最初也没想到要给小孙换车，他觉得这小姑娘还是肯勤学苦练的，只要好好培养，是会成为一把好手的。可是眼下的实际问题是产品质量不能保证，“107”号车出的降等布又比较多。所以，当别人提出要和小孙换车的时候，老谭也就同意了。不料小孙却执意不换。这叫老谭怎能不生气呢？他冲着小孙说：
    “不换车就不要值车。”
    “不值车就不值车，反正我不换。”倔强的小孙也不示弱。小组会就这样不欢而散。
    小孙为什么坚持不换车呢？她有自己的想法。去年春季，厂里掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产高潮，姐妹们都增加了看车的台数，小孙也增多了台数。偏巧在这时候，小孙的车出了毛病，忙的她顾东顾不了西，质量老是上不去。组里的师傅和她换了车。她换上好车后，工作是轻松多了，但心里总觉得不是滋味儿。后来她学习了《关于重庆谈判》一文，毛主席说：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”她想，换车就是把困难推给别人，这实际是逃避困难、不敢斗争的表现。老这样下去，学徒工怎么能变成熟练工呢？再说，为国家生产更多、更好的产品，学徒工也有份啊！这次她明知道看“107”号车困难很多，但她要闯闯这个关。
    小孙今年十九岁，很小失去了双亲，在党的关怀抚育下成长起来。磨炼出一副“顶风而上”的性格。进厂以来，在党团组织帮助下，加入了共青团，这就为她那种“顶风而上”的性格增添了新的内容。她的心里蕴藏着一股为革命而织布的热情。正是由于这样，她用了比别人多几倍的时间苦练技术，在很短的时间内，学会了摇龙头、跑巡回、换梭、打结头……。技术很快地提高了，终于和师傅们一样，被评为优级水平。
    小孙被停值车后，她可急了，马上跑去找党支部书记张素珍同志，要求还是让她看“107”号车。张素珍十分认真地听完了小孙的意见，答应了她的要求，并且说：“你的想法很好，支部全力支持你。”张素珍接着又说：“你为什么不把这些想法在小组会上谈出来呢？要早说，也不会闹得这样僵。”
    “好些事就坏在我这执拗的性子上，我真恨自己。”小孙说，“我找组长检讨去！”
    当大家明白了小孙的想法后，都积极支持她，师傅们也主动地帮她出主意，想办法，几天之后，“107”号车终于织出了好布，总算制服了老爷车。
    最近，厂里又革新了一种新布机，要试织一批产品。看来困难是很多的。然而小孙却挺身而上，参加了试织。她那苗条的身影一忽儿闪现在这台车前，一忽儿又出现在那台车后。两脚踏着轻盈的步子，巡回在一台台布机之间，活象一只刚出窠的小燕子，迎着疾风向前飞翔。
