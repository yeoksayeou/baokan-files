　　Xinhua News Agency, Cotonou, 5th--Following the Dahomean government's unilateral and unreasonable announcement of the termination of diplomatic relations with China, Chinese Ambassador to Dahomey Li Yunchuan and other embassy officials left Cotonou by plane on the 5th.
　　Before leaving, Ambassador Li Yunchuan handed the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement protesting the Dahomean government's unreasonable termination of Sino-Dahomean diplomatic relations to the Dahomean Foreign Ministry.
　　In a statement issued at the airport, Ambassador Li Yunchuan pointed out: The Dahomean government's unilateral tearing up of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Chinese Government and the Dahomean Government and its serious actions to undermine Sino-Dahomean relations not only damaged the Dahomean government's international reputation, but also ran counter to the interests of the broad patriotic people and all the people of Dahomey. He expressed his firm belief that the friendship between the Chinese and Dahomean people cannot be undermined by anyone, and the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its followers are bound to fail.
　　Friends from Dahomey and diplomatic envoys stationed in Dahomey saw them off at the airport.

    新华社科托努五日电　在达荷美政府片面无理宣布终止同中国的外交关系后，中国驻达荷美大使李云川和使馆其他官员五日乘飞机离开科托努。
    在离开之前，李云川大使把中国外交部抗议达荷美政府无理终止中、达两国外交关系的声明交给了达荷美外交部。
    李云川大使在机场上发表的声明中指出：达荷美政府片面撕毁中国政府和达荷美政府关于建立外交关系的联合公报和破坏中、达两国关系的严重行动，不仅损害了达荷美政府的国际信誉，而且也是与达荷美广大爱国人士和全体人民的利益背道而驰的。他表示深信，中、达两国人民的友谊是谁也破坏不了的，美帝国主义及其追随者的阴谋终究是要失败的。
    到机场送行的有达荷美的朋友们和驻达荷美的外交使节。
