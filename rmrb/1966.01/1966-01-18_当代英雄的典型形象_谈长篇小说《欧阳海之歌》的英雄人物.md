Edition: 6

    Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our people are conducting an in-depth socialist education movement; are carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and Dazhai, relying on our own efforts, working hard, and engaging in socialist construction at a high speed; and are making all preparations to resolutely strike and eliminate the US imperialism that dares to invade. Therefore, the whole nation is striving to learn the revolutionary spirit of Wang Jie. Wang Jie's spirit has become the spirit of our times. In the current revolutionary situation in our country, which is surging so high, a revolutionary heroic epic – the novel "Ouyang Hai's Song" – has appeared.
    The most valuable achievement of "Ouyang Hai's Song" is that, based on true people and events, it wholeheartedly sings the praises of a communist fighter's life; uses typical plots and fervent language to quite prominently shape Ouyang Hai, an exemplary hero in the style of Lei Feng and Wang Jie, who is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution, fearing neither hardship nor death. Ouyang Hai's glorious image reflects the spiritual outlook of the great Mao Zedong era. It can be fully anticipated that the glorious image of the hero Ouyang Hai will, with the widespread circulation of "Ouyang Hai's Song," give our younger generation, who are embarking on the road of revolutionization, a profound ideological influence.
    After reading this work, what will we think about? What exactly is the basic path for the growth of our contemporary heroes? Where does the importance of education through heroic examples lie? What do Ouyang Hai and the emergence of "Ouyang Hai's Song" illustrate?
    Ouyang Hai grew up in bitterness, advanced directly under the education and care of the Party and comrades, and himself had the spirit to "take out his life" for the revolution. But even so, Ouyang Hai's growth, although not long in time, experienced a series of arduous and complex struggles. The struggle enabled him to accept Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong Thought in turn encouraged him to devote himself to the struggle. The struggle also made his noble communist spirit manifest. It was Mao Zedong Thought and the socialist revolutionary struggle that nurtured Ouyang Hai's growth.
    After the "heavenly soldiers and generals" (the People's Liberation Army) liberated Laoyawo, Ouyang Hai was determined to follow the PLA to the front lines, to do great things in a magnificent way like Zhou Hushan and Dong Cunrui. Therefore, when the squad leader asked him to hold an axe and cut trees in the mountains, when the political instructor did not approve his going to Tibet to fight and wanted him to swing a hammer and break stones on the spot, he felt that "everything was over" and regretted being born a few years later than Dong Cunrui. Ouyang Hai came to participate in the revolution, but he didn't understand what revolution was; he dreamed of becoming a hero, but he didn't understand what a hero was.
    Hating exploitation when thinking about it, wanting to fight the enemy when seeing them – this is Ouyang Hai's most fundamental class consciousness, indicating that he truly "is a good piece of iron." Therefore, after repeated education by the company leaders, he quickly came to understand that in a game of chess, the chariot has the chariot's use, and the pawn has the pawn's use; the needs of the revolution should be the individual's willingness; cutting trees and carrying logs is also support for the Tibetan people. So he shouted: "Eliminate the bandits, add oil! Support Tibet, do it!" and ran all over the mountains carrying logs weighing one hundred seventy or eighty pounds. From then on, no matter what work he did, he went all out, working "without caring for his life," diligently practicing superb skills, and hammering 280 times in one go. He worked during breaks, he worked even when he was sick, he worked with his back bare and his feet bare, and he "always had that fiery energy in him, unable to sit still, unable to be idle, doing work when he saw it, rushing to take on danger" – he joined the Youth League and was commended. Obviously, Ouyang Hai was taking a big step forward.
    However, he "wasn't running very steadily yet!" He felt that he was not far from being a hero. After wearing a big red flower, he dreamed of taking a "very spirited" photo and sending it home. During night shooting, he rushed to lead the whole squad to cut pigweed before the competition: in the face of honor, Ouyang Hai faced a new test. In order to strictly help Ouyang Hai grow healthily, the company leaders did not give Ouyang Hai the task of demonstrating bayonet fighting, but gave it to Liu Weicheng. But he and Liu Weicheng thrust three times with the bayonet and turned around to "walk" away. Ouyang Hai still didn't break through the honor barrier. It can be seen that it is not enough for a soldier to only initially understand that all work is for the revolution; he should further train himself to become a true hero, a truly conscious revolutionary fighter.
    In our era, for people who come from great suffering and have deep hatred for class enemies, it is relatively easy, under the education of the Party and starting from simple class feelings, to understand the reason for making revolution; but how to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, establish a communist worldview, and become a noble person, a pure person, a person who is free from low tastes, requires undergoing many arduous trials. This is also the very real problem facing Ouyang Hai at that time: whether he can demand more of himself, this is a major hurdle on Ouyang Hai's road to revolutionization. In the face of such a difficult hurdle, and facing a soldier like Ouyang Hai, should one "not use a heavy hammer to strike a loud drum," or should one "use a heavy hammer to strike even a loud drum"? The Party organization insisted on adopting the latter method, and constantly "tapped" him, inspiring him to make revolution consciously. Precisely because Ouyang Hai was of one mind with the Party, he was fully able to withstand this loving "tapping," and at the same time could immediately translate it into action (his nightly appointment with Liu Weicheng to practice bayonet fighting is a prominent example). Therefore, he finally realized that "to do revolutionary work, one must be honest and realistic, and not seek vanity." Conscious revolution prompted Ouyang Hai to take steps to overcome major obstacles.
    Conscious revolution – this is the requirement that the Mao Zedong era puts forward to every one of our fighters, is the requirement of the three great socialist revolutions, and is also the requirement of the future transition to communist revolution. The ideological height of revolutionary heroes in the socialist era can only be the ideological height of communism. This ideological height means that in politics, thought, and moral concepts, one must thoroughly break with all old traditions in history, mainly thoroughly break with the entire traditional ideology of the bourgeoisie that dares to directly confront us. Ouyang Hai's image is a typical image of resolutely implementing this break. In "Ouyang Hai's Song," there is no sound of gunfire, and no class enemies appear, but there are antagonistic ideas in the work – bourgeois ideas; there is a fierce battle between proletarian ideas and bourgeois ideas; and this battle often takes place in Ouyang Hai's mind. This is the serious struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology that we often talk about. In the face of such a thorough revolutionary task, our people, without exception, must undergo a test of arduous self-transformation. This test is no more peaceful or easy than the test on the front lines. Deeply revealing the seriousness of this struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology and the inevitable victory of the proletariat is the main key to the success of "Ouyang Hai's Song" in shaping an ordinary soldier into a tall heroic image, and is also the fundamental reason why Ouyang Hai's heroic image can have such a strong spiritual influence at present.
    In our era, to carry out conscious revolution, one must, as Ouyang Hai's successful practice has revealed: the most fundamental of the fundamental, the most urgent of the urgent, is to arm one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought. Without this, one cannot complete the leap of conscious revolution. Just imagine, without Chairman Mao's education, without the help of leading comrades at all levels who disseminate Mao Zedong Thought, relying only on the impetus of simple class revenge psychology, could Ouyang Hai so closely link every drop of sweat, every load of soil, and the entire revolution together? Could he withstand so many tests of honor, never be complacent, and continue to work hard, so that in a peaceful construction period without fighting, when the revolution needs him, he can stand up and sacrifice himself bravely? It was precisely under the constant, close nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, precisely through deeply experiencing the great power of Mao Zedong Thought in daily struggles, that Ouyang Hai, regardless of his low level of education, studied Chairman Mao's works so eagerly; that he rushed to the city in the middle of the night, waited in the rain all night, waiting to buy a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume Four; that he so honestly sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works when he encountered difficulties at work (even if it was late at night). He was determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. The source of endless spiritual power lies in Mao Zedong Thought. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no Ouyang Hai.
    Mao Zedong Thought's influence on Ouyang Hai is mainly directly reflected through the words and deeds of the company leaders. Here, Political Instructor Zeng Wujun should be especially mentioned. Zeng Wujun embodies living Mao Zedong Thought. To what extent has he done political and ideological work in the cause of educating people! To what a noble realm has he developed the love of proletarian comrades! Every step forward made by Ouyang Hai is inseparable from the political instructor's kind teachings. In order to help Ouyang Hai, he even kept Ouyang Hai's family letters, dreams, every basket of soil, and every bowl of rice in his heart. He showed heartfelt joy for any progress made by Ouyang Hai; but he never let go of even the slightest shortcomings of Ouyang Hai. "A loud drum is also struck with a heavy hammer" is one of his famous sayings. His own exemplary behavior (such as enduring the pain and silently protecting the safety of the soldiers and materials with his body, which greatly shocked Ouyang Hai) made his political and ideological education work exude great appeal. Zeng Wujun is the Dong Cunrui beside Ouyang Hai.
    Diligently tempering oneself in practical struggles, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, is another important experience of Ouyang Hai's conscious revolution. In Ouyang Hai's short life, how many tests and struggles did he undergo, and how many good things did he do for the people! Carrying big logs, going down a well to save people, sacrificing his life to build roads… The more difficult it was, the more he rushed to take on the work, completely disregarding personal gains and losses. Chairman Mao's books must be read, but Chairman Mao's thought must be learned in doing. Doing is the best way to learn. In order to temper his strong will, Ouyang Hai chose the most arduous road, which was also the most solid road. Ouyang Hai's growth process proves a truth to us: only by being able to withstand the test of sacrificing personal interests in ordinary times can one withstand the test of sacrificing personal life at critical moments; the climax of the heroic movement can only be the inevitable result of the development of each movement.
    It was precisely under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in the repeated tests of arduous struggle that Ouyang Hai was able to continuously revolutionize and gradually embark on the path of a conscious fighter. The path that Ouyang Hai took clearly shows us that the transformation of the world outlook is a fundamental transformation; the idea of being "born red" does not work even for Ouyang Hai. It can be seen that from a poor child to a PLA soldier; from only having simple class revenge psychology to completely and consciously establishing a communist worldview, Ouyang Hai experienced a process that a revolutionary hero must experience and that is full of contradictory struggles. This process is the process of transforming the subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world, that is, the process of conscious revolution, and also the process of heroic growth. Only after experiencing this process did Ouyang Hai completely break with all traditional concepts; unite the interests of the Party with personal destiny, the ideals of the revolution with the practice of the revolution, and the great with the ordinary; be completely selfless, dedicated to serving others, endure great hardships, endure hard work, be ready to do what is right, and be receptive to good advice. Look how hard he worked on the construction site, shouting "Hold high the red flag of revolution, do it!" while working! Look how he gritted his teeth under the pain of having diarrhea more than ten times a day, "like a newly fired shell, running forcefully with a roar," in order to win honor for the Chinese people! Look how he silently led the comrades to complete the tense culvert project with his hands burned while putting out a fire! Look how he jumped into the well to save people, "rushing towards the raging fire," completely disregarding his personal safety. He dedicated everything he had to the revolution. He said: "The Party wants me to do anything, I will do anything; the revolution wants me to sacrifice, I will get up and take my life out." What great drive! What a tenacious fighting spirit! What high awareness! Faced with all this, one cannot help but exclaim enthusiastically: even if engaged in a ordinary and trivial task (even like Ouyang Hai eating a bowl of rice, carrying a few loads of soil), as long as it is inspired by the noble ideals of communism, it will be so closely linked with our country's revolution, the world revolution, and show such a profound meaning! When a fighter (even an ordinary soldier like Ouyang Hai) is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, how high can the subjective initiative of the people and the people's spiritual strength be brought into play, and what earth-shattering things can they do! The noble heroic image here tells us another truth: when people's minds are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, when they fight for the magnificent cause of communism, when they deeply hate capitalism, imperialism, and revisionism, they will show extraordinary courage, superhuman perseverance, and a spirit of selflessness and sacrifice in engaging in all revolutionary struggles, and they will create miracles in the world. Our revolutionary cause, having crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, having crossed countless rapids and dangerous shoals, is advancing rapidly; our younger generation is emerging in the fiery revolutionary furnace, emerging with groups of heroic warriors. All these facts definitively declare to people that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force and the deepest and broadest source of the boundless potential of a strong motherland; Mao Zedong Thought is the foundation of our victory, and Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of the spirit of our times.
    Taking Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and becoming a veritable shock trooper in all work has already shown an important aspect of Ouyang Hai's conscious revolution. The struggle with Acting Political Instructor Xue Xinwen regarding subjectivism and thorough materialism reveals another height of his noble spiritual world. Such a struggle is tortuous and complex, requiring not only adherence to principles but also adherence to unity. Therefore, a person with even a little personal idea, or a person without a grand ideal, could never make this struggle advance along the correct path. For Ouyang Hai, this was undoubtedly another strict exam. Ouyang Hai was troubled by this matter, but he read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words, so he was always politically clear and the lines of right and wrong were always clear. He did not become depressed because of grievance, he did not give up the struggle because he was a leader, he did not feel discouraged because of the twists and turns of the struggle, he did not rush to explain himself because of misunderstanding, he did not relax his vigilance because of the mistakes of criticism, and he did not become complacent because of the victory of the struggle. On the contrary, he became more humble. Finally, when Xue Xinwen deeply examined his mistakes at the general military meeting of the entire company, Ouyang Hai instead examined himself, and sincerely hoped that Xue Xinwen would "demand more strictly of us, manage us more boldly, and help us to get closer to the Party's requirements as soon as possible." Reading this, and then reading about how Xue Xinwen's excited tears flowed down his cheeks, and how Ouyang Hai took the initiative to run forward and shake hands with him… we are completely moved by the hero's high degree of principled spirit and the most noble class friendship he embodies! One Ouyang Hai fully reflects the great vitality of our army's political and ideological work.
    From begging for rice, being bitten by a dog, fighting bullies, joining the army, arm wrestling, cutting trees, swinging a hammer, building roads, rushing to rescue, rescuing drowning people, camping, visiting relatives, to being criticized and suffering grievances, Ouyang Hai experienced multifaceted and extremely severe training and tests in revolution, labor, honor, criticism, as well as family relations and personal marriage issues. Noble ideals and arduous struggles nurtured his noble qualities and strong will. Only at this time was "a good piece of iron" tempered into steel, and Ouyang Hai truly became a conscious revolutionary fighter, truly understanding what a hero is. He realized that he was just a member of Chairman Mao's team, and that all his achievements were only the result of Chairman Mao's personal nurturing and the enthusiastic help of the masses; he deeply realized that "what is there to fear for someone who is wholeheartedly thinking about revolution?" realized that "making merit is not about wearing a red flower on one's chest, but about carrying a heavy burden on one's shoulders." realized that "as long as we uphold what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our team will definitely prosper." Therefore, he stood higher, saw farther, and was more conscious, more diligent, and more humble. Only at this time could he truly "base himself in the company, have the motherland in his heart, and have the world in his eyes," linking any work with our country's three great socialist revolutionary movements, with anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and supporting the world people's revolution, fearing neither hardship nor death. Such a soldier, if he had participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, would have been able to die generously like Liu Hulan; if he had participated in the War of Liberation, he would have been able to blow open a path to victory for the revolution with his own life like Dong Cunrui; if he had been imprisoned in a concentration camp, he would have been able to calmly walk to the execution ground like Sister Jiang; if he had participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, he would have been able to pounce on the enemy's bunker like Huang Jiguang. Our Ouyang Hai did not have the opportunity to hold a gun and fight to the death with the class enemy, but in the four seconds of brief, life-or-death choice, he rushed forward without hesitation, stopped the wild horse, rescued the train, "his face did not change color, his heart did not beat," and dedicated his precious life to the great Mao Zedong era.
    Didn't Ouyang Hai always want to fight and become a hero at first? Although he was commended and joined the Youth League, he was still not a hero; but when he completely and thoroughly established the belief of fighting to the end for communism, did many good deeds that benefited the people, and had become a veritable hero, he did not admit that he was a hero, and even felt more uneasy in the face of honor. This is the process of change from unconsciousness, semi-consciousness to full consciousness, a change that is reflected so vividly, richly, and deeply in Ouyang Hai!
    Comrade Ouyang Hai lived greatly and died gloriously. His epic actually began after he joined the army, and glorious sacrifice was only the climax of the heroic movement.
    Ouyang Hai does have many unique characteristics, but at the same time, as a hero, Ouyang Hai has a high degree of typicality. From him, we see the general characteristics of contemporary heroes, that is: they are conscious revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought; inspired by the noble ideals of communism, they, together with the broad masses, carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology and dare to engage in any arduous socialist struggle; they are never intimidated by enemies and difficulties, nor are they complacent with any victory they have achieved; they fear neither hardship nor death, and dedicate their lives to our country's revolution and the world revolution. To learn from heroes, we must learn these qualities from them.
    Education through the examples of revolutionary heroes has always been an important part of our traditional education, class education, and future education for the younger generation. The younger generation always advances along with heroic figures. Many of our revolutionary soldiers charged and even sacrificed themselves, carrying "How the Steel Was Tempered". How much spiritual strength did Huang Jiguang draw from Dong Cunrui before his death! Lei Feng was determined to be a hero in the style of Huang Jiguang before his death; Wang Jie pasted Lei Feng's photos and excerpts from his diaries in his own notebook. The emergence of Lei Feng and Wang Jie influenced the spiritual outlook of our entire younger generation. Ouyang Hai continued to advance along the path of Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Sister Jiang, and Lei Feng. A large number of facts show that taking Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and taking heroic figures as examples, consciously transforming one's thoughts, has become an inevitable path for the healthy growth of our younger generation. Lei Feng took this path, Wang Jie took this path, and Ouyang Hai also took this path. Mao Zedong Thought has opened up a path to the ideal realm of communism for our younger generation, and the realization of the ideal depends on the hands of our generation of youth to create it. As long as we have the spirit of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Ouyang Hai, and rely on our own hands to make diligent efforts bit by bit, we will surely be able to overthrow an old world and create a new world. Therefore, our current younger generation should all take this path.
    Literature and art serve politics, and our literature has an unshirkable responsibility to undertake the glorious task of education through the examples of heroic figures. The practice of our socialist literature over the past sixteen years also tells us that all excellent works that have had a profound influence on promoting the ideological revolutionization of young readers are works that have written heroic figures well; the connection between young readers and these works is first established on the basis of ideological connection with the heroic figures in them. In recent years, our literature, especially the literary creation of the troops, has greatly exerted the weapon role of literature by writing socialist themes and heroic figures in a big way; praising heroic figures has become a common practice in literary creation. Therefore, the success of the writing of "Ouyang Hai's Song" is not accidental. It is the result of the high praise of the revolutionary spirit of the people of our country, the rapid advance of the younger generation on the road of revolutionization, and the in-depth development of the socialist cultural revolution. In the process of creating "Ouyang Hai's Song," it received enthusiastic help and care from relevant leading cadres inside and outside the army and from the broad masses of soldiers and commune members; after the publication of the work, it has been valued by all parties, and young readers regard this work as a good teacher and helpful friend. Does this not precisely show that socialist heroic figures have penetrated people's hearts and writing heroic figures in a big way has become an urgent demand of the times?
    Now, we are in a period of great development and great deepening of the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and socialist cultural revolution. We not only have the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, but also countless heroes and heroines. As long as we mobilize the professional and amateur literary creation teams, the two armies advance side by side, taking Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and delve into the fiery struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will surely be able to "find" countless Ouyang Hai's and write countless "Ouyang Hai's Songs."

    当代英雄的典型形象
    ——谈长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》的英雄人物
    阎纲
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国人民正在进行深入的社会主义教育运动；正在发扬大庆、大寨的革命精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，高速度地从事社会主义建设事业；并且做好一切准备，坚决打击和消灭敢于进犯的美帝国主义。因而，全国人民都在努力学习王杰的革命精神。王杰的精神，已经成为我们的时代精神。正在目前我国这样高涨的革命形势下，一部革命英雄主义的乐章——长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》出现了。
    《欧阳海之歌》最宝贵的成就，是它在真人真事的基础上，满腔热忱地歌颂了一位共产主义战士的一生；用典型化的情节和炽烈的语言，相当突出地塑造了欧阳海这样一个以毛泽东思想武装起来的、一心一意为革命、一不怕苦、二不怕死的雷锋、王杰式的英雄人物典型。欧阳海的光辉形象，反映了伟大的毛泽东时代的精神面貌。完全可以预期到，英雄欧阳海的光辉形象，将会随着《欧阳海之歌》的广泛流传，而给予我们正在走向革命化道路的青年一代以深刻的思想影响。
    读了这部作品，我们会想些什么呢？到底什么是我们当代英雄成长的基本途径？英雄榜样的教育的重要性在哪里？欧阳海和《欧阳海之歌》的出现说明了什么？
    欧阳海是在苦水里泡大的，是直接在党和同志们的教育关怀下前进的，他自己又有“把命能拿出来”的劲头。但即便如此，欧阳海的成长，时间虽然不长，却经历了一系列艰苦复杂的斗争锻炼，斗争使他接受了毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想反过来又鼓舞他投身于斗争之中，斗争也使他崇高的共产主义精神显现出来。正是毛泽东思想和社会主义革命斗争哺育着欧阳海的成长。
    “天兵天将”（解放军）解救了老鸦窝以后，欧阳海便立志跟解放军上前线，象周虎山、董存瑞那样轰轰烈烈地大干一番。因而，当班长要他握紧斧子、上山砍树的时候，当指导员不批准他到西藏打仗、要他就地抡锤打石头的时候，他觉得“一切都完了”，后悔比董存瑞晚出世几年。欧阳海是来参加革命的，却不理解什么是革命；他梦寐以求地想当英雄，却不理解什么是英雄。
    想到剥削就恨，看见敌人就想拼，这是欧阳海最根本的阶级觉悟，说明他确“是块好铁”。因而，经过连首长反复的教育，他很快地能够懂得在一盘棋里，车有车的用场，卒有卒的用场；革命的需要，就应当是个人的自愿；砍树、扛木头，也是对西藏人民的支援。所以，他高喊：“消灭叛匪，加油！支援西藏，干呵！”扛着一百七八十斤重的木头满山飞跑。从此以后，他不论干什么工作，都全力以赴，“不要命”地猛干，苦练过硬本领，一气打了二百八十大锤。他休息时干，病了也干，光着脊梁、赤着脚干，他“身上总有那股火辣辣的劲，坐不住，闲不着，见了工作就干，遇了危险，抢着也要上”——他入了团、立了功。很显然，欧阳海是大踏步地向前迈进了。
    但是，“跑得还不太稳哪！”他觉着自己离英雄已经不远了。他戴上大红花以后，作梦也想着照个“挺神气”的相片寄回家去。夜间射击，他赶在评比之前领上全班突击打猪草：在荣誉的面前，欧阳海面临着一个新的考验。为了严格地帮助欧阳海健康的成长，连首长把刺杀示范表演的任务没有交给欧阳海，而交给了刘伟城，但他和刘伟城刺了三枪，转身就“走”，荣誉一关，欧阳海还是没有突破。可见，一个战士只是初步地理解一切工作都是为了革命是不够的，还应该进一步锻炼自己成为一个真正的英雄、真正的自觉的革命战士。
    在我们的时代里，出身很苦、对阶级敌人怀有深仇大恨的人，在党的教育下，从朴素的阶级感情出发，懂得要革命和为什么革命的道理是比较容易的；但如何用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，建立共产主义世界观，变成一个高尚的人、纯粹的人、脱离低级趣味的人，却需要经过多次的、艰苦的磨炼。这也就是摆在欧阳海当时非常现实的问题；能不能更高、更严地要求自己，这是欧阳海革命化道路上的一大难关。在这样的难关前面，又面对着欧阳海这样的战士，是“响鼓不用重锤敲”呢，还是“响鼓也用重锤敲”？党组织坚持采用了后一种办法，而且不断地对他“敲打”，启发他自觉革命。正由于欧阳海和党一条心，他完全经得住这种慈母般的“敲打”，同时能够立即见诸行动（他连夜约刘伟城练刺杀就是突出的一例），所以，他终于体会到“干革命工作要老老实实，实事求是，不能图虚名”。是自觉革命，促使欧阳海迈步越过重重大关。
    自觉革命，这是毛泽东时代向我们每一个战士提出的要求，是社会主义三大革命的要求，也是将来要过渡到共产主义革命的要求。社会主义时代革命英雄的思想高度，只能是共产主义的思想高度。这种思想高度，就意味着在政治上、思想上、道德观念上，要和历史上一切旧的传统彻底决裂，主要是同敢于和我们直接对抗的资产阶级一切传统的意识形态彻底决裂。欧阳海的形象，就是坚决实行这种决裂的典型形象。在《欧阳海之歌》里，并没有听到枪炮声，也没有阶级敌人出场，但是作品里却存在着敌对的思想——资产阶级思想；存在着无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的激烈战斗；而这场战斗，还常常在欧阳海的头脑里进行着。这就是我们常说的兴无灭资的严重斗争。在这样一场彻底革命的任务面前，我国人民，无一例外地要经受一番艰苦的自我改造的考验，这种考验，并不比火线上的考验来得平和容易。深刻地揭示出这场兴无灭资的严重性和无产阶级必胜的前途，是《欧阳海之歌》把一个普通一兵塑造成为高大的英雄形象成功的主要关键，也是欧阳海的英雄形象在当前能够发生这样强烈的精神影响的根本原因。
    在我们的时代，要进行自觉革命，就要象欧阳海成功的实践所启示的那样：根本之中最根本的，迫切之中最迫切的，就是用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，舍此不能完成自觉革命的飞跃。试想，离开毛主席的教育，离开传播毛主席思想的各级领导同志的帮助，只凭朴素的阶级复仇心理的推动，欧阳海能把每一滴汗、每一担土和整个革命如此紧密地联系在一起吗？能经受这么多荣誉的考验，永不自满、再接再厉，以致在不打仗的和平建设时期，当革命需要的时刻，挺身而出、勇敢牺牲吗？正是在毛泽东思想每时每刻的亲切哺育下，正是在日常斗争生活中深刻体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力，欧阳海才不怕文化水平多低，那样如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作；才在半夜时分赶到城里、淋了一夜雨等着买一本《毛泽东选集》第四卷；才在工作中遇到困难时（那怕夜已经深了），那样老老实实地向毛主席著作求教。他决心读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。无穷无尽的精神力量的源泉，都在于毛泽东思想之中。没有毛泽东思想，就没有欧阳海。
    毛泽东思想对欧阳海的熏陶和培育，主要是通过连首长的言传身带直接体现出来的。这里特别应该提到指导员曾武军。曾武军的身上，体现了活的毛泽东思想。在教育人的事业中，他把政治思想工作做到了何等精细的程度！他又把无产阶级同志的爱发展到何等崇高的境界！欧阳海的每一个进步，都和这位指导员亲切的教导分不开的。他为了帮助欧阳海，甚至连欧阳海的家信、梦呓、每一筐土、每一碗饭都挂在心上。他对欧阳海的任何一点进步，都表现出发自内心的喜悦；但对欧阳海的那怕微小的缺点，却决不放过。“响鼓也用重锤敲”就是他的一句名言。他自己的模范行为（如忍受着伤痛，默默无闻地用肉体保全了战士和物资的安全，这使欧阳海受到极大的震动），更使他的政治思想教育工作，发出巨大的感召力量。曾武军，就是欧阳海身旁的董存瑞。
    在实际斗争中刻苦地磨炼自己，活学活用毛主席著作，是欧阳海自觉革命的又一条重要的经验。在欧阳海短短的一生中，他经受了多少考验，多少斗争，给人民办了多少好事！扛大木头，下井救人，舍身忘命地修路……越是艰苦，他越抢着上，根本不顾个人的利害得失。毛主席的书要读，但毛主席的思想要在干中去学，干就是最好的学习；为了磨炼自己的坚强意志，欧阳海选择了一条最艰苦的道路，也是最扎实的道路。欧阳海的成长过程向我们证明了一个真理：只有在平时经得起牺牲个人利益的考验，紧要关头才能经得起牺牲个人生命的考验；英雄乐章的高潮，只能是各个乐章发展的必然结果。
    正是在毛泽东思想的哺育下和艰苦斗争的反复考验中，欧阳海才能够不断革命，逐渐走上自觉战士的道路。欧阳海走过的道路明显地启示我们：世界观的转变是个根本的转变；“自来红”的思想，即使在欧阳海身上也是行不通的。可见，从一个苦孩子到一个解放军战士；从只有朴素的阶级复仇心理到完全自觉地建立起共产主义世界观，欧阳海经历了一个革命英雄必然经历的而又充满矛盾斗争的过程。这个过程就是在改造客观世界中改造主观世界的过程，就是自觉革命的过程，也是英雄成长的过程。只有经历了这个过程，欧阳海才和一切传统观念实行了彻底决裂；把党的利益同个人的命运，把革命的理想同革命的实践，把伟大同平凡统一起来；毫不利己，专门利人，吃大苦，耐大劳，见义勇为、从善如流。你看他在工地上多卖力气，一边干活、一边高喊“高举革命红旗，干呵！”你看他在每天腹泻十多次的病痛下，咬紧牙关，为了给中国人民争口气，“象颗刚刚出膛的炮弹，带着呼啸，有力地奔跑着”；你看他用救火时烧伤的双手默默不语地带头和同志们完成了紧张的涵洞工程；你看他为了救人，跳下水井，“迎着烈火冲上去”，根本不顾个人的安危。他把自己的一切献给革命，他说：“党要我干什么，我就干什么；革命要我去牺牲，我就起身把命拿出去。”多大的干劲！多顽强的斗志！多高的觉悟！面对着这一切，不能不使人发出热烈的赞叹：即使从事一件平凡细琐的工作（那怕象欧阳海这样吃一碗饭、担几担土），只要被共产主义崇高理想所鼓舞，它就会那样紧紧地和我国革命、世界革命联系在一起、显示出那样深刻的意义来！当一个战士（那怕象欧阳海这样的普通一兵），只要被毛泽东思想武装起来，人的主观能动性、人的精神力量就能够发挥到何等的高度，能做出何等惊心动魄的事情来！崇高的英雄形象在这里又告诉我们另外一条真理：当人的头脑用毛泽东思想武装起来、为壮丽的共产主义事业而奋斗、深深地仇恨资本主义、帝国主义和修正主义的时候，他们就会表现出非凡的勇敢、超人的毅力和舍身忘我地从事一切革命斗争的牺牲精神，就会创造出人间的奇迹。我们的革命事业，跨过了千山万水，渡过了无数个急流险滩，突飞猛进地向前发展；我们的青年一代，在烈火熊熊的革命熔炉里，涌现出成群的英雄壮士。一切一切的事实铁定地向人们宣示，毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力，是强大祖国无穷潜力最深广的根源；毛泽东思想是我们的胜利之本，毛泽东思想是我们时代精神的高峰。
    以毛泽东思想挂帅，在各项工作中成为名副其实的突击队员，已经显示出欧阳海自觉革命的重要方面，和代理指导员薛新文的关于主观主义与彻底的唯物主义的一场斗争中，则揭示出他崇高精神世界的又一个高度，这样一场斗争是曲折复杂的，不但要坚持原则，而且要坚持团结。因而，稍有个人杂念的人，或者没有远大理想的人，决不可能使这一斗争沿着正确的轨道前进。对欧阳海来说，无疑是又一次严格的考试。欧阳海为这件事苦恼过，但是他读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，所以他在政治上始终是清醒的，是非界线始终是分明的。他并不因委屈而消沉，不因是领导而放弃斗争，不因斗争的曲折而懊丧，不因误会而急于表白，不因批评的错误而放松警惕，更不因斗争的胜利而自满，相反的，他更虚心了。最后，当薛新文在全连的军人大会上深刻地检讨了自己的错误，欧阳海反而检查了自己，并且真诚地希望薛新文“更严格地要求我们，更大胆地管理我们，帮助我们尽快地接近党的要求。”读到这里，接着又读到薛新文激动的热泪怎样从脸颊流下来，欧阳海怎样主动跑上前去和他握手……我们完全被英雄高度的原则精神和他所体现的最崇高的阶级友爱打动了！一个欧阳海，充分地反映了我军政治思想工作伟大的生命力。
    从讨米、被狗咬、反霸、参军、扳腕子、砍树、抡锤、筑路、抢险、救溺、野营、探亲，一直到挨批评受委屈，欧阳海经历了革命、劳动、荣誉、批评以及家庭关系、个人婚姻问题等多方面的、极严峻的锻炼和考验。崇高的理想和艰苦的斗争，培育了他高贵的品质和坚强的意志。也只有在这个时候，“一块好铁”才算是百炼成钢，欧阳海才真正成为自觉的革命战士，真正理解了什么是英雄。他认识到自己不过是毛主席队伍中的一个成员，自己的一切成绩，只能是毛主席亲手抚育和群众热心扶助的结果；他深刻地认识到“一心想着革命的人，还有什么可畏惧的呢？”认识到“立功，不是胸前挂上了一朵红花，而是在肩上挑起了一副重担。”认识到“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来”。因而，他站得更高了，看得更远了，更自觉、更刻苦、更谦逊了。也只有在这个时候，他才能真正地“立足连队，胸怀祖国，眼观世界”，把任何工作都同我国社会主义三大革命运动，同反帝反修支援世界人民革命联系在一起，一不怕苦，二不怕死。这样的战士，参加抗日战争，完全能够象刘胡兰那样慷慨就义；参加解放战争，完全能够象董存瑞那样，用自己的生命为革命炸出一条通往胜利的道路；关在集中营里，完全能够象江姐那样从容自若地走向刑场；参加抗美援朝，完全能够象黄继光那样扑向敌人的掩体。我们的欧阳海，没有机会持枪上阵和阶级敌人决一死战，但是在四秒钟短暂的、生死抉择的时刻，却毫不犹豫地向前冲去，拦住烈马，抢救列车，“脸不变色，心不跳”，把自己的宝贵生命，献给伟大的毛泽东时代。
    当初，欧阳海不是总想打仗、当英雄吗？尽管立了功、入了团，他仍旧不是英雄；但当他完全、彻底地树立了为共产主义奋斗到底的信念、做出了许许多多有益于人民的好事，已经成为名副其实的英雄的时候，他却并不承认自己是英雄，甚至在荣誉面前更加于心不安了。这就是从不自觉、半自觉到完全自觉的变化过程，这一变化在欧阳海身上体现得多么生动、丰富、深刻呵！
    欧阳海烈士生的伟大，死的光荣，他的史诗实际上从参军以后就已经开始，光荣牺牲则不过是英雄乐章的高潮。
    欧阳海身上确实有他自己独具的许多特点，同时，作为一个英雄，欧阳海却具有很高的典型性。从他的身上，我们看到了当代英雄的一般特征，那就是：他们是毛泽东思想武装起来的自觉革命的战士；他们在共产主义崇高理想的鼓舞下，同广大群众一起，进行兴无灭资的斗争并勇于从事社会主义的任何艰苦的斗争；他们从不为敌人和困难所吓倒，也从不为任何已得的胜利而自满；他们一不怕苦，二不怕死，终生为我国革命和世界革命而献身。我们向英雄们学习，就是要学习他们身上的这些品质。
    革命英雄的榜样教育，从来都是我们向年青一代进行传统教育、阶级教育、前途教育的重要内容之一。青年一代总是跟随着英雄人物一同前进的。我们的许多革命战士，是带着《钢铁是怎样炼成的》向敌人冲锋陷阵、甚至牺牲的。我们的黄继光生前在董存瑞身上吸取了多大的精神力量！雷锋生前要立志做黄继光式的英雄；王杰把雷锋的照片和日记摘录贴在自己的日记本上。雷锋、王杰的出现，影响了我们整个年青一代的精神面貌，欧阳海又沿着董存瑞、黄继光、江姐、雷锋的道路继续前进，大量的事实表明，以毛泽东思想为武器，以英雄人物为榜样，自觉地改造思想，已经成为我国青年一代健康成长的一条必由之路。雷锋走的这条路，王杰走的这条路，欧阳海也走的这条路。毛泽东思想为我们青年一代开辟了一条通向共产主义的理想境界的道路，而理想的实现，则要靠我们一代青年的双手去创造，只要具有雷锋、王杰、欧阳海的精神，凭自己的双手一点一滴辛勤的努力，我们就一定能推翻一个旧世界，打出一个新天下。所以，我们现在的青年一代，都应该走这一条路。
    文艺是为政治服务的，我们的文学，责无旁贷地应该把英雄人物的榜样教育的光荣任务承担起来。十六年来我国社会主义文学的实践也告诉我们，凡是对促进青年读者思想革命化方面发生过深刻影响的优秀作品，都是英雄人物写得好的作品；青年读者同这些作品的联系，首先建立在同它们中的英雄人物思想联系的基础上。近几年来，我们的文学，尤其是部队的文学创作，由于大写社会主义，大写英雄人物，大大发挥了文学的武器作用；歌颂英雄人物，已经在文学创作中蔚然成风。所以，《欧阳海之歌》写作的成功也不是偶然的，它是我国人民革命精神高扬、青年一代在革命化的大道上大踏步前进和社会主义文化革命深入发展的结果。《欧阳海之歌》在创作过程中，受到了军内外各有关领导干部和广大战士、社员热情的帮助和关怀；作品出版以后，又受到各方面的重视，青年读者更视这部作品为良师益友，这难道不正是说明社会主义英雄人物已深入人心，大写英雄人物已经成为时代的迫切要求了吗？
    现在，我们已处在社会主义革命、社会主义建设和社会主义文化革命的大发展、大深入的时期，我们不但有毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，而且有数不尽的英雄好汉，只要我们动员起专业的和业余的文学创作队伍，两路大军，齐头并进，以毛泽东思想为指针，深入到工农兵群众的火热斗争中去，我们就一定能“找”到无数个欧阳海，写出无数部《欧阳海之歌》。
