    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 10th: Saigon Dispatch: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces in the "Iron Triangle" area on the outskirts of Saigon, relying on the support of the people, the dense network of tunnels, and mobile and flexible tactics, have repeatedly frustrated the invading U.S. aggressor troops, who are constantly being attacked.

    According to Western news agencies, a large number of U.S. aggressor troops, together with Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, are conducting a "largest sweeping operation" in the area outside Saigon, attempting to search for the Liberation Army and guerrillas there. More than two hundred helicopters transported these invading troops into the area on the 8th. When these U.S. troops and accomplice troops entered the jungle on the edge of the "Iron Triangle" area, they saw only empty trenches and tunnels, and could not "capture" the Liberation Army and guerrillas. The Liberation Army and guerrillas, relying on the trenches and tunnels everywhere, constantly attacked the enemy. An Associated Press reporter said, "We can see the Viet Cong from time to time, but we can't catch them. They jump into the common holes."

    Before this "sweep," the United States sent a large number of planes to bomb the area, but these sturdy tunnels were impervious to it. An Associated Press report admitted, "The giant B-52 bombers that attacked the area could not move these tunnels at all."

    It is reported that these U.S. troops and accomplice troops could not find the Liberation Army and guerrillas, but were constantly attacked by the Liberation Army and guerrillas. In the anti-"sweep" battles on the 9th, the Liberation Army and guerrillas destroyed and damaged five U.S. helicopters.

    南越人民武装机动灵活使敌人找不到打不着
    美军向“铁三角”地区发动“扫荡”连连扑空
    新华社十日讯  西贡消息：西贡外围铁三角地区的越南南方解放武装力量依靠人民的支持，密布的地道网和机动灵活的战术，使得进犯的美国侵略军连连扑空，而且不时挨打。
    据西方通讯社报道，大批美国侵略军伙同澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军正在西贡外围地区进行一次号称为“规模最大的席卷行动”，企图搜索那里的解放军和游击队。二百多架直升飞机八日把这些侵略军队运入这个地区。当这批美军和帮凶军进入“铁三角”边沿地区的丛林时，只见一个接一个空的壕沟和坑道，却“捕捉”不着解放军和游击队。而解放军和游击队却依靠各地的壕沟和坑道不断地袭击敌人。美联社记者说，“我们不时可以看到越共，但抓不住他们。他们一跃就钻进常见的地洞里去了”。
    在这次“扫荡”前，美国出动了大批飞机轰炸这个地区，但是对这些坚固的坑道无可奈何。美联社的报道承认，“袭击这个地区的巨型B—52型轰炸机对这些坑道，也无法动它们的分毫”。
    据报道，这些美军和帮凶军找解放军和游击队打找不到，却不断遭到解放军和游击队的袭击。在九日的反“扫荡”战斗中，解放军和游击队就击毁、击伤美国直升飞机五架。
