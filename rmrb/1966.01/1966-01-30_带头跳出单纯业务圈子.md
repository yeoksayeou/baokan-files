    Taking the Lead in Breaking Away From a Purely Business-Oriented Circle
    The more you try to solve business problems with business approaches, the more passive you become, and the worse the problems are solved. When you highlight politics in business work, many things become easier.
    In the daily work of the Finance Committee, the largest part involves specifically implementing the Party's guidelines and policies, inspecting and arranging the specific work of various departments, and handling the relationships between industry and commerce, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, domestic and foreign trade, and so on. These tasks are very specific, highly policy-oriented, and highly business-oriented. In the past, our Provincial Finance Committee did not highlight politics when dealing with business. As a result, the more we tried to solve business problems with business approaches, the more passive we became, and the worse we were at solving the business problems. Even some policies that had been specifically stipulated earlier were later found not to have been fully implemented or implemented well during inspections. The reason for this is that we did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul. When conducting daily business work, we often neglected to highlight politics and neglected to focus on ideological work. Sometimes we did ideological work, but it was unconscious and infrequent, and we did not integrate it into the entire process of handling specific business problems, but instead often fell into a purely business-oriented circle.
    In the past year, we have studied the documents of the National Finance and Trade Political Work Conference, summarized past experiences and lessons, and realized that finance and trade work, like other revolutionary work, serves the politics of the proletariat. We must do every specific business job well in order to better accomplish the great political tasks of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is by no means just a purely business matter. And to do every specific business job well, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and highlight politics at all times and in all things. In the past year or so of practice, we have also deeply realized that in the process of grasping business work, we encounter the most active and specific and vivid thoughts, so it is more necessary to highlight politics and do ideological work. Only by putting ideological and political work in the first place, doing political work ahead of business work, and implementing it throughout the entire process of business work can we do business work well.
    With improved understanding, doing ideological and political work becomes more conscious. We always grasp ideology first, then business. Every time we hold a meeting, we first focus on "virtual" matters, then on "real" matters. When dealing with specific business problems, we first solve ideological problems, then specific business problems. Because the leaders of the Finance Committee paid attention to grasping ideological and political work, business work truly had a soul, many things became easier, and the phenomenon of each other coming to the Finance Committee to "complain" disappeared. Various departments actively cooperated, closely coordinated, and worked together to do the work well. Last year, two things greatly inspired us and taught us the most profound lessons. One was the warehouse problem between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives. Originally, the warehouses of the two were used together, and there were often disputes due to mutual occupation. In the end, they came to the Finance Committee to solve it. We did not solve the specific problem for them first, but instead asked them to first study Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists." As a result, the problem was quickly resolved reasonably, and both parties were satisfied. Another time, comrades from the food company came to me and said that it was difficult to complete the annual live pig transfer plan. I targeted their thinking and gave him a booklet introducing the Dazhai experience, asked him to first study the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, and pointed out that in fact their task was not impossible to complete, but they were frightened by difficulties in their thinking. In this way, without settling detailed accounts with them or adjusting the task, they still completed the plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. These two things made me feel that whether or not we highlight politics is indeed the fundamental issue of the revolutionization of our leadership work.
    How to highlight politics when grasping business work? We mainly have the following experiences.
    To highlight politics, we must take class struggle as the key link. The work process of finance and trade departments is a process of constant struggle with various capitalist ideas. To do finance and trade work well, we must constantly struggle with the capitalist business thinking of "doing a lot if there is a lot of profit, doing a little if there is a little profit, and not doing anything if there is no profit." We must constantly struggle with the purely business viewpoint that "business can still be completed without highlighting politics." We must do ideological and political work in daily business work, so that comrades who do specific business work can be freed from the purely business-oriented circle, broaden their horizons, stand tall, see far, and link their work with the great revolutionary struggle. Make them consider problems and handle work from a political perspective, starting from production, and always think of facilitating the masses in everything. For example, at the beginning of last year, the supply and marketing cooperatives did not want to operate ammonia water, mainly because they felt that the profit was small and they were afraid of trouble. We focused on solving their ideological problems, explaining that the supply of agricultural production materials cannot only consider profits, but must first start from production. Their enthusiasm was mobilized, and they promptly met the needs of agricultural production.
    In the relationship between industry and commerce, the relationship between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, and the relationship between domestic and foreign trade, the most prominent problem is departmentalism. Wherever problems arise, it is generally only the small accounts of their own units that are being considered. To solve these relationship problems, we cannot simply grasp specific business, but must fight against departmentalism. Of course, all units must keep accounts, but they must not only keep the small accounts of one unit, but also the large accounts of the entire society; not only economic accounts, but also political accounts. For example, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives are now both calculating large accounts, political accounts, and production accounts, and the relationship is closer than in the past. Regarding the issue of industrial products going to the countryside, in the past, both parties often came to the Finance Committee to "complain," arguing about the proportion of urban and rural distribution. Now, because both parties have the idea of facing the countryside, they cooperate very well. The two organizations organize joint mobile purchase and sales teams to go deep into the countryside, purchase and sell door-to-door, and meet the needs of the masses. State-owned commerce takes the initiative to rely on supply and marketing cooperatives and help supply and marketing cooperatives; supply and marketing cooperatives also take the initiative to act as assistants to state-owned commerce.
    The Party's guidelines and policies are formulated by specifically applying Mao Zedong Thought, and they are the basis for us to carry out all specific work. Without the Party's guidelines and policies, we cannot complete various business tasks quickly, well, and economically, and may even make mistakes. Therefore, when inspecting the business work of various departments, we cannot only look at how their planned figures have been completed, but mainly see how they have implemented the Party's guidelines and policies. In the past year, when we grasped the specific business work of various departments, we first grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works and the study of the Party's guidelines and policies, and the various departments became more conscious in implementing the Party's guidelines and policies.
    The Finance Committee should promptly summarize and promote the experience of highlighting politics and leading business with politics, as well as major typical examples with directional significance, instead of summarizing those purely business work experiences. Last year, we summarized and promoted the experience of the Zhaigeduo Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fushan County, which highlighted politics and wholeheartedly supported production and construction in mountainous areas, the experience of the industry, transportation, finance and trade departments in Yicheng County, which closely cooperated to carry out direct commodity transportation to support agricultural production, as well as the experience of the Yucheng People's Bank, the Baichi Credit Cooperative in Huguan, and the Zhaokang Pig Purchase Station, and so on. Because these experiences all highlighted politics and were led by Mao Zedong Thought, the experience quickly achieved immediate results once it was promoted. Moreover, these experiences not only have an impact on one industry, but often cross out of the industry and promote the entire finance and trade work.

### 带头跳出单纯业务圈子

    带头跳出单纯业务圈子
    越是就业务解决业务问题，就越是被动，越解决不好；抓业务工作的时候突出政治，许多事情都好办了。
    财委的日常工作中，最大量的是具体贯彻党的方针政策，检查布置各部门的具体工作，以及处理工业和商业的关系，国营商业和供销合作社的关系，内贸和外贸的关系，等等。这些工作，都非常具体，政策性非常强，业务性也非常强。过去，我们省财委抓业务没有突出政治。结果，越是就业务解决业务问题，就越是被动，越不能把业务问题解决好。甚至于有的政策早已作了具体规定，可是后来检查起来，却没有完全贯彻下去，或者贯彻得不好。究其原因，是我们对毛主席关于政治是统帅是灵魂的教导领会不深，在进行日常业务工作的时候，常常忽视了突出政治，忽视了抓思想工作，有时候也抓思想工作，但是不自觉，不经常，没有把它贯串到处理具体业务问题的全部过程中，而是往往陷于单纯业务圈子里。
    近一年来，我们学习了全国财贸政治工作会议的文件，总结了过去的经验教训，认识到财贸工作和其他革命工作一样，都是为无产阶级的政治服务的。我们要把每项具体的业务工作做好，是为了更好地完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设这个伟大的政治任务，决不只是单纯的业务问题。而要做好每项具体的业务工作，又必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，时时事事突出政治。在一年多来的实践中，我们还深深地体会到，在抓业务工作的过程中，碰到的活思想最多，也最具体，最生动，因此更需要突出政治，做思想工作。只有把思想政治工作放在首位，把政治工作做在业务工作的前头，贯彻到业务工作的整个过程当中，才能把业务工作做好。
    认识提高了，做思想政治工作就自觉了。凡事先抓思想，后抓业务。每次开会，先务“虚”，后务“实”。处理具体业务问题的时候，先解决思想问题，后解决具体业务问题。由于财委领导注意了抓思想政治工作，业务工作真是有了灵魂，许多事情好办了，过去那种彼此到财委来“告状”的现象不见了。各部门主动协作，密切配合，共同把工作做好。去年，有两件事情对我们启发很大，教育最深。一件是国营商业和供销合作社两家的仓库问题。原先，两家的仓库是一块伙用的，常常因为彼此占用，纠缠不清。最后，找到财委来解决。我们没有先给他们解决具体问题，而是让他们都先学习毛主席著作和刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》。结果，问题很快得到合理的解决，而且两家都满意。另一件，食品公司的同志来找我，说完成全年生猪外调计划有困难。我就针对他们的思想，给了他一本介绍大寨经验的小册子，让他先学习大寨的革命精神，并且指出实际上他们的任务并不是不能完成，而是思想上被困难吓住了。这样，既没有同他们算细账，也没有调整任务，他们还是提前超额完成了计划。这两件事情，使我感到，突出不突出政治，确实是我们领导工作革命化的根本性问题。
    怎么样在抓业务工作的时候突出政治呢？我们主要有以下的体会。
    要突出政治，必须以阶级斗争为纲。财贸部门的工作过程，是经常和各种资本主义思想斗争的过程。要想把财贸工作做好，就要经常和那种“利大大干，利小小干，没利不干”的资本主义经营思想作斗争，就要经常和那种认为“不突出政治，业务照样可以完成”的单纯业务观点作斗争。要把思想政治工作做到日常业务工作中去，使做具体业务工作的同志从单纯业务圈子里解脱出来，打开眼界，站得高，看得远，把自己的工作同伟大的革命斗争联系起来。使他们考虑问题，处理工作，都能从政治上着眼，从生产出发，时时、事事想到便利群众。例如，去年年初，供销合作社不想经营氨水，主要是嫌利润小，怕麻烦。我们着重解决了他们的思想问题，说明农业生产资料的供应，不能光考虑利润，而首先要从生产出发。他们的积极性被调动起来，及时满足了农业生产的需要。
    在工业和商业的关系、国营商业和供销合作社的关系、内贸和外贸的关系方面，最突出的问题是本位主义思想。凡是出问题的地方，一般都是只算自己单位的小账。要解决好这些关系问题，不能单纯抓具体的业务，而是必须同本位主义思想进行斗争。当然，各单位都要算账，但是一定要既算一个单位的小账，更要算整个社会的大账；不仅算经济账，更要算政治账。例如，国营商业和供销合作社，现在双方都算大账，算政治账，算生产账，关系就比过去密切了。关于工业品下乡的问题，过去双方常到财委来“告状”，争论城乡分配的比例。现在，由于双方都有了面向农村的思想，协作得很好。两家组织联合流动购销队深入农村，上门购销，满足群众需要。国营商业主动依靠供销社，帮助供销社；供销社也主动作国营商业的助手。
    党的方针政策，是具体运用毛泽东思想制定的，它是我们进行各项具体工作的依据。离开党的方针政策，就不能多快好省地完成各项业务工作，甚至会犯错误。因此，在检查各部门业务工作的时候，不能仅是看他们计划数字完成得怎样，而主要是看他们对党的方针政策贯彻得怎么样。去年一年中，我们在抓各部门具体业务工作的时候，首先抓毛主席著作的学习和党的方针政策的学习，各部门在贯彻执行党的方针政策方面就更加自觉了。
    财委要及时总结和推广突出政治、政治带业务的经验，以及带有方向性的重大典型，而不是总结那些单纯的业务工作经验。去年我们曾总结推广了浮山县寨圪?供销社突出政治，全心全意扶植生产、建设山区的经验，翼城县工交财贸部门密切配合，开展商品直线调运支援农业生产的经验，以及榆次人民银行、壶关百尺信用合作社、赵康生猪收购站的经验，等等。由于这些经验都是突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，所以经验一经推开，很快收到立竿见影的效果。而且，这些经验不仅对一个行业有影响，常常是跨出本行业，推动了整个财贸工作。
