    Shouldering the Burden
    Chang Gong

    The more difficult the time, the more important it is to proceed from the overall interest.
　　——Instructor Chen Maohan's words

    Rain was falling overhead, and underfoot was a mixture of mud and water.

    Chen Maohan, the instructor of the 1206 Drilling Team of Daqing Oilfield, was walking back to his team after attending the five-level cadre meeting. Before the meeting, he and Captain Zeng had led the entire team to complete a well in sixty-one hours, winning the all-around drilling championship; yesterday afternoon, their team created a new record of drilling 697 meters in a single day. The news reached the meeting and was immediately praised by the leaders of the Ministry of Petroleum. At this moment, he was thinking about how to tell the team the news and how to build on this foundation to achieve even higher levels. Thinking, thinking, he raised his head and looked around, but he couldn't help but be stunned. It turned out that their drilling rig had stopped rotating, and people were climbing on the tall derrick.

    What an unexpected thing this was! Chen Maohan rushed towards the well site, taking two steps as one. He saw the captain standing on the drilling platform, covered in mud, his eyes bloodshot, angrily staring blankly. The workers were all pouting and silent. The captain saw him and couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, tears streaming down his face: "I'm sorry to the Party, sorry to the people..."

    "Be calm, be calm," Chen Maohan comforted him.

    Seeing that the captain was exhausted and in such a bad mood, Chen Maohan decided to shoulder the burden: "I'm here. You go back and get some sleep now."

    After the captain left, Chen Maohan called the driller over to understand the situation. As soon as the driller saw the instructor, he said, "I'm responsible for this. I've disgraced the entire team." It turned out that the accident happened at one o'clock in the morning. At that time, the driller lowered several hundred meters of drill pipe into the well. Seeing that there were no problems, he asked the deputy driller to take over while he went to have supper. Unexpectedly, shortly after he left, the hard clutch malfunctioned, and the traveling block didn't obey orders and rushed towards the crown block. There was a loud crash, the traveling block hit the crown block, the wire rope was cut, and it fell down...

    "Why didn't you repair it quickly?" Chen Maohan asked.

    "As soon as the accident happened, the captain got angry, losing his temper at this one moment, and getting angry at that one the next."

    "How are the worker comrades?"

    "Everyone is holding a stomach full of anger."

    Chen Maohan deeply felt that as the Party branch secretary, a political worker, in such a situation, he must proceed from the overall interest and assume all responsibilities. So, he gathered the workers together for a meeting. At the beginning, he clearly stated: It is very painful that the accident caused losses to the country. Everyone has their own responsibilities for the accident, but from the team's point of view, the most important responsibility lies with the branch, with himself. The reason is that since drilling began, the branch's mind has been hot, only emphasizing progress, ignoring safety, and knowing that the hard clutch had a problem but not dealing with it in a timely manner.

    Originally, the workers had a lot of opinions about the captain. Now, upon hearing what the instructor said, the resentment in their hearts slowly dissipated.

    "I know everyone has opinions about the captain," Chen Maohan continued, taking advantage of the situation. "The captain lost his temper with everyone, found fault, and said some unpleasant things, which is wrong. But, everyone knows the characteristics of our captain! Our captain is one of the 'Five Tiger Generals' of the oilfield. As long as the work goes smoothly, he works like he doesn't care about his life. Wherever the Party points, he can fight there. Conversely, if the work doesn't go up, his whole body is uncomfortable, and he even kicks the drill bit and drill pipe."

    "Yes, yes, yes," the workers became somewhat active.

    "Let's think about it from the captain's perspective," Chen Maohan continued. "I went to the meeting, and he was solely responsible at home, staying at the well site for three days, creating a new record for daily footage with everyone. But, at such a time, such an accident happened. How could he not be sad, not be anxious? When he's anxious, he's not calm; when he's not calm, he gets angry; when he gets angry, it's hard to say pleasant things. Do you all think that's the case?" The workers carefully thought about it and felt that the instructor's words were right. They said to the instructor: "Let the past be the past. Let's hurry up and start repairing. If we don't repair it, other teams will leave us even further behind."

    "Yes, we must catch up," Chen Maohan took advantage of the enthusiasm and immediately organized the workers. Those who went up the derrick went up the derrick, those who transported materials transported materials. In an instant, the silent well site boiled again. In less than three hours, the drilling rig issued a booming sound, continuing to advance towards the depths of the formation.

    The captain, free from fatigue, came to the well site with a refreshed spirit. Seeing the drilling rig rotating rapidly, seeing the workers' morale high, his energy came back. He immediately walked up to the instructor and said, "Now it's your turn to go back and get some sleep."

    "I can still persevere," Chen Maohan saw that the captain's energy had returned, and he was happy from the bottom of his heart. He immediately explained the process of handling the accident and then said with a smile, "I think you have to change your temper."

    "Please watch my actions!"

    Originally, after the captain returned to the dormitory, he thought for a long, long time. He knew that losing his temper was wrong, that it affected unity and work. He wanted to get rid of this problem. But, when the time came, he just couldn't help it. What was the reason for this? The main reason was that he didn't recognize the seriousness of the problem enough, always thinking that his temper was for the sake of work, for the sake of the Party's cause. Now it seemed that it actually hindered the work and hindered the Party's cause, and he couldn't help but be surprised. So, he was determined to correct this problem...

    Chen Maohan was even happier and quickly congratulated him, saying, "As long as you can change, I dare to guarantee that our drilling team will go from one victory to another."

    Sure enough, from then on, a new atmosphere appeared in the whole team, and the cadres and workers were even more united. The heroic 1206 Drilling Team has been advancing rapidly, and its red flag has been flying over Daqing Oilfield. (Attached picture)

专栏：指导员的故事

    把担子挑起来
    常工
    越是困难的时候，越要从整体利益出发。
　　——指导员陈茂汗的话
    头上，正下着雨，脚下，一片泥和水。
    陈茂汗，大庆油田一二○六钻井队的指导员，参加了五级干部会议之后，正走回他们的井队去。会议之前，他同队长曾领着全队的工人，以六十一个小时完成了一口井，夺得钻井的全能冠军；昨天下午，他们队上又创造了日进六百九十七米的新纪录，消息传到会场上，当即受到石油部领导同志的表扬。此刻，他正在想着怎样把这个消息告诉井队，又怎样在这个基础上打出更高的水平来。想着，想着，把头一抬，放眼望去，却不由得愣住了，原来，他们的钻机不转了，高高的井架上爬着人。
    这是多么出人意料的事啊！陈茂汗两步当作一步地奔向井场，只见队长站在井台上，满身满脸都是泥，两眼熬得红通通，气得直在那里发愣。工人们呢，也都是噘着嘴，不作声。队长看见他不觉心头一酸，流下了眼泪：“我对不起党，对不起人民。……”
    “要冷静，要冷静。”陈茂汗安慰着。
    看到队长累的不行，又见他心情这样不好，陈茂汗决心把担子挑起来：“这里有我，你现在赶快回去睡个觉。”
    队长走后，陈茂汗把司钻找了过来了解情况。司钻一看到指导员就说：“这事由我负责，我给全队丢了脸。”原来，事故是夜间一点钟发生的。那时，司钻把几百米的钻杆下到井下后，看看没有问题，便叫副司钻代管，自己趁空吃夜饭去了，不料，他刚刚离开不久，硬离合器失灵了，游动滑车不听命令，直向天车冲去。只听轰隆隆的一阵巨响，游动滑车碰到了天车，绞断钢丝绳，掉了下来。……
    “为什么不赶快修复？”陈茂汗问道。
    “事故一发生，队长便火了，一会向这个发脾气，一会又向那个生气。”
    “工人同志们怎么样呢？”
      “大家都憋着一肚子气。”
    陈茂汗深深感到，作为党的支部书记，一个政治工作者，在这样的情况下，必须从整体利益出发，把一切责任承担起来。于是，他把工人集合起来开会。一开始，他就明确的表示：出了事故，给国家造成了损失，这是很痛心的。出了事故，各人有各人的责任，但从全队来说，最主要的是支部负责，是他自己负责。原因是从开钻以来，支部的头脑一直是热的，只强调进度，忽视了安全，明明知道硬离合器有毛病，也没有及时地处理。
    本来，工人们对队长的意见是很大的，现在，一听指导员这么说，结在心里的一股怨气不能不慢慢地消散了。
    “我知道大家对队长有意见。”陈茂汗趁势说下去：“队长向大家发脾气，找别扭，说了一些不好听的话，这都是不对的。可是，咱们队长的特点，大家不是不了解呀！咱们的队长是油田上的‘五虎上将’之一。只要工作顺利，他干起来是不要命的，党指向那里，他能打向那里，相反，要是工作上不去，他的全身都不是个劲，看到钻头、钻杆，也要踢上几脚。”
    “对，对，对。”工人们有些活跃了。
      “我们替队长设身处地的想一想吧。”陈茂汗继续说：“我开会去了，他一个人在家负全责，三天来一直坚守在井场，跟大家一起创造了日进尺的新纪录，可是，就在这样的时候，发生了这样的事故，他能不痛心，不着急吗？一着急，就不冷静；不冷静，就要发火；一发火，说话就难听了。大家说是不是这么回事？”工人们仔细一寻思，觉得指导员的话对。纷纷向指导员说：“过去的就让它过去吧，现在赶快动手修理，再不修理，别队把咱们拉的就更远啦。”
    “对，咱们一定要赶上去。”陈茂汗趁着这个热气，立刻把工人们组织起来。上井架的上井架，运材料的运材料，霎时，沉寂的井场又沸腾起来。不到三个小时，钻机便发出隆隆的响声，继续向着地层深处前进了。
    消除了疲劳的队长，精神焕发地来到了井场。看到钻机在急速的旋转，看到工人们的斗志很昂扬，他的干劲又来了，立刻走到指导员的面前说：“这回可该你回去睡睡觉了。”
    “我还能坚持。”陈茂汗看到队长干劲又来了，打从心里高兴，立刻把处理事故的经过说了一遍，然后才笑着说：“我看你的脾气可得改一改了。”
    “请看我的行动吧！”
    原来，队长回到宿舍以后，想了很久很久。他知道发脾气是不对的，既影响团结，又影响工作，要把这个毛病改掉。可是，到了时候，自己就是忍不住，这是什么原因呢？最主要的原因是自己对这个问题的严重性认识不够，总以为自己发发脾气，是为了工作，是为了党的事业，现在看来，实际上是妨害了工作，妨害了党的事业，他不由得吃惊起来。于是，他下决心要改正这个毛病……
    陈茂汗更是高兴，连忙向他祝贺说：“只要你能改，我敢保证，咱们的井队就能从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。”
    果然，从这以后，全队出现了新气象，干部、工人之间也更加团结，英雄的一二○六钻井队一直在飞速地前进，它的红旗，一直飘扬在大庆油田上空。（附图片）
