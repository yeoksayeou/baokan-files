    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 11th. Some Japanese Diet members and party leaders spoke to Chinese reporters on the 10th, condemning the US for playing with the "peace talks" conspiracy.
    Kawakami Kan'ichi, head of the Japanese Communist Party Diet members group and member of the House of Representatives, pointed out that if we strip away the deceptive exterior of the US's "Fourteen Points Plan", we can see that its premise is to remain in South Vietnam. Kawakami emphasized that the rhetoric of the US "Fourteen Points Plan" cannot conceal its aggressive nature, and that the Vietnam problem can only be resolved by following the four-point proposal put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    He said that while the Sato government is supporting the US war of aggression against Vietnam, it has recently been working hard for the US peace talks conspiracy, which the Japanese people absolutely cannot allow.
    Narita Tomomi, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, pointed out that the "peace offensive" played by the US is a deception and is bound to fail.
    Narita said that after playing this "peace offensive," the US will follow up with further expansion of the war of aggression.
    Narita emphasized that the Vietnam problem can only be resolved if the US accepts the four-point proposal put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Hara Takeshi, a Socialist Party Diet member, after exposing the US "peace talks" conspiracy, pointed out that there will only be true peace when the US withdraws its troops from Vietnam, dismantles military facilities, and leaves the Vietnam problem to the Vietnamese people themselves to solve in accordance with the Geneva Accords.
    Hotta Kei, a Socialist Party Diet member, pointed out that the so-called "Fourteen Points Plan" proposed by the US government regarding the Vietnam problem is a preparation for its next step of expanding the war of aggression through "gradual escalation." He said that the Japanese people cannot tolerate the US's aggressive behavior in Vietnam.
    Utsunomiya Tokuma, a Liberal Democratic Party Diet member, said that the US wants to make a gesture through the "peace offensive," as if it wants "peace," in order to completely shift the responsibility to North Vietnam as an excuse to expand the war.
    Utsunomiya pointed out that if the US disregards the will of the world and takes risks, it will surely bring destruction upon itself.
    Utsunomiya emphasized that the US must reflect on its policies towards Asia and Vietnam, and the US should withdraw all its troops from South Vietnam.
    He said: The Vietnam problem should be left to the Vietnamese people themselves to solve.
    According to reports, Sasaki Kozo, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, told Japanese reporters in Sendai on the 7th that "the 'peace offensive' currently launched by the US on the Vietnam issue is a deception and a gesture made to domestic and international public opinion." He expressed his belief that "the US's 'peace offensive' is bound to end in failure."

    日本人民不容佐藤政府为美国“和谈”阴谋效劳

    新华社东京十一日电  日本的一些国会议员、政党领袖十日对中国记者发表谈话，谴责美国玩弄“和谈”阴谋。
    日本共产党国会议员团团长、众议院议员川上贯一指出，揭开美国骗人的“十四点计划”的外衣，可以看到它的前提就是赖在南越不走。美国“十四点计划”的花言巧语掩盖不了它的侵略的本质，川上强调指出，只有按越南民主共和国提出的四项主张才能解决越南问题。
    他说，佐藤政府在支持美国侵略越南战争的同时，最近又为美国的和谈阴谋大卖力气，这是日本人民绝对不能容许的。
    社会党书记长成田知巳指出，美国玩弄的“和平攻势”是一个骗局，它肯定是要失败的。
    成田说，美国在玩弄了这一场“和平攻势”之后，紧跟着将是进一步扩大侵略战争。
    成田强调，只有美国接受越南民主共和国提出的四项主张，才能解决越南问题。
    社会党国会议员原彪在揭露了美国的“和谈”阴谋后指出，只有美国从越南撤出军队，拆除军事设施，按照日内瓦协议，把越南问题交给越南人民自己去解决，才会有真正的和平。
    社会党国会议员帆足计指出，美国政府提出的所谓关于越南问题的“十四点计划”，是为它下一步扩大侵越战争的“逐步升级”作准备。他说，日本人民不能容忍美国在越南的侵略行为。
    自由民主党国会议员宇都宫德马说，美国想通过“和平攻势”作出一种姿态，似乎它是要“和平”的，以便把责任完全推给北越，作为它扩大战争的借口。
    宇都宫指出，如果美国冒天下之大不韪，进行冒险，就必定自取灭亡。
    宇都宫着重说，美国必须反省它对亚洲和越南的政策，美国应当从南越撤出它的全部军队。
    他说：越南问题应当交给越南人民自己解决。
    据报道，日本社会党委员长佐佐木更三在七日在仙台向日本记者发表谈话说，“美国现在在越南问题上展开的‘和平攻势’是一个骗局，是对国内和国际舆论所作出的一种姿态。”他表示相信，“美国的‘和平攻势’必定以失败而告终。”
