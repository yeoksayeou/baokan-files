    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 30th – Just as Hong Kong residents are strongly condemning U.S. nuclear-powered warships for carrying out war intimidation and nuclear blackmail in Hong Kong, two more U.S. warships, the “Calvert” and the “Rooster,” entered Hong Kong's inland waters yesterday.

    It is reported that as of 11:00 a.m. today, there are still nine U.S. warships lingering in Hong Kong. In addition to the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and the nuclear-powered cruiser "Bainbridge," the other seven include the destroyers "Duncan," "Roberts," and "Hawkins," the submarine "Dogfish," the armed transport ship "Calvert," the oiler "Caliente," and the submarine rescue ship "Rooster." Another U.S. warship, the "Finch," quietly left Hong Kong for other destinations on the 28th.

    According to reports in the local press, in 1965 alone, U.S. warships entered Hong Kong 344 times. From November of last year to January 30 of this year, there have been as many as 104 visits by U.S. warships to Hong Kong, which shows that while the U.S. Johnson administration is stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, it is also intensifying its use of Hong Kong as a base for expanding its war of aggression.

    Hong Kong's *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* today continue to prominently report the statements of prominent figures from Hong Kong and Macao's business, industry, labor, film, education, and women's circles regarding the entry of the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise," etc., into Hong Kong. In their statements, these prominent figures strongly protested against U.S. imperialism for using Hong Kong as a base for its further expansion of the war of aggression and for carrying out naked nuclear blackmail crimes in Hong Kong. They firmly demanded that the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise," the nuclear-powered cruiser "Bainbridge," and other U.S. warships, which are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, immediately get out of Hong Kong.

### 悍然不顾香港公众强烈抗议和谴责  美国两艘军舰又开进香港内海

    悍然不顾香港公众强烈抗议和谴责
    美国两艘军舰又开进香港内海
    新华社香港三十日电　正当香港居民强烈谴责美国核动力军舰在香港进行战争恫吓和核讹诈的时候，昨天又有两艘美国军舰“卡尔弗特号”和“雄鸡号”开进香港内海。
    据悉，到今天中午十一时止，仍有九艘美国军舰赖在香港，其中除核动力航空母舰“企业号”和核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”外，另外七艘中有驱逐舰“邓肯号”、“罗伯特斯号”和“霍金斯号”，潜水艇“狗头鱼号”，武装运输舰“卡尔弗特号”，运油舰“卡连特号”和潜艇救护舰“雄鸡号”。另一艘美国军舰“芬奇号”已于二十八日悄悄离港他去。
    据这里的报刊报道，在一九六五年一年中，进入香港的美国军舰为三百四十四艘次。从去年十一月到今年一月三十日，来港美舰共有一百零四艘次之多，可见美国约翰逊政府在加紧扩大侵略越南战争的同时，正加紧使用香港作为它扩大侵略战争的基地。
    香港《文汇报》和《大公报》今天继续以显著地位报道香港、澳门的工商界、工会、电影界、教育界和妇女界等知名人士就美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”等开进香港发表的谈话。这些知名人士在谈话中强烈抗议美帝国主义把香港作为它进一步扩大侵略战争的活动基地，并在香港进行赤裸裸的核讹诈罪行。他们坚决要求沾满越南人民鲜血的美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”、核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”和其他美国军舰立即滚出香港。
