    From the opinions raised at this symposium, it can be seen that there are still many ideological issues that need clarification regarding how to understand the relationship between politics and production. We hope that everyone, based on the specific circumstances encountered in their work, will adopt the method of presenting facts and reasoning, summarize experiences and lessons, and further expand the discussion on the following issues:

    I. What does it mean to give prominence to politics? What are the different effects of highlighting politics versus not highlighting politics on work?

    II. Why do many comrades not pay enough attention to highlighting politics? What are some ideological obstacles, and what is the fundamental reason?

    III. Some comrades believe that politics is about grand principles, and one cannot speak empty words when leading production. Some comrades believe that it is enough to focus on political work and that it is not necessary to lead production. What is the relationship between politics and production? How can we truly highlight politics and also combine the two well?

    IV. How can we truly highlight politics and make it truly effective?

    希望大家展开讨论
    从这个座谈会上提出的意见中可以看到，怎样认识政治和生产的关系，还有许多思想问题需要澄清。我们希望大家根据自己在工作中所碰到的具体情况，采取摆事实、讲道理的方法，总结经验教训，就下面的几个问题进一步展开讨论：
    一、什么叫做突出政治？突出政治和不突出政治，工作的效果有什么不同？
    二、为什么许多同志对突出政治重视不够，有些什么思想障碍，根本原因在那里？
    三、有的同志认为，政治是大道理，领导生产不能说空话。有的同志认为，只抓好政治工作就行，不必抓生产领导。政治与生产到底是什么关系，如何真正突出政治，又能把两者很好地结合起来？
    四、怎样才能真正突出政治，而且做得确有实效？
