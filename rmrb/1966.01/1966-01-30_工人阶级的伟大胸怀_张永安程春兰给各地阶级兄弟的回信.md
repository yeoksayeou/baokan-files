Edition: 6

    Editor's Note: We recommended the news report "Class Feelings Weigh a Thousand Jin" to our readers. Today, we recommend another letter from comrades Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan to their class brothers across the country. After their story was published in the newspapers, it aroused a response from the broad masses of readers. Many people wrote letters to comfort them and praise them, and some even wrote to express their willingness to send their sons to them. This shows how many workers with "class feelings weighing a thousand jin" have emerged in the Mao Zedong era.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We have all come from all corners of the country and have joined together for a common revolutionary goal." Precisely because there is a "common revolutionary goal," all conscious workers, peasants, and all working people can see the interests of the class and the interests of the collective as higher than everything else. This revolutionary sentiment and class compassion of ours are unparalleled by any other class. This noble class feeling will drive us to achieve greater victories on the road of revolution and construction!
    Dear Comrades:
    Since the *Wuhan Evening News* and *Workers' Daily* published the story of our family losing our biological son, newspapers in Beijing and other provinces and cities have published this matter one after another. In the past few months, our family has received letters from class brothers from all corners of the motherland, sometimes receiving ten or twenty letters a day, comforting us and encouraging us. Every word is worth a thousand gold, and every sentence is full of strength!
    We are both working couples, and we always use the time before meals or before going to sleep to read the letters. Sometimes, our father says, "Wait a moment to read them, the food is getting cold." How can we wait? We can't rest until we finish reading the letters from our class brothers! A comrade from the remote border region of the motherland got up in the middle of the night to write a letter to our family! These letters have given us infinite strength!
    A few days ago, the two of us were under the lamp writing replies to our class brothers from all corners of the motherland. We wrote and wrote, and so many words were churning in our hearts, but our low level of education prevented us from writing them out! Later, after discussion, we decided to write a general letter in the newspaper, to the best of our ability!
    On the day we lost our biological son, our hearts were indeed overwhelmed with pain. We walked unsteadily, and our heads were dizzy. However, one thing was clear in our minds: the dead cannot be brought back to life. There is no way to change that, and we must not add to the pain and loss of Master Mei's family. Neither our family nor the Mei family are from Wuhan; we all came together to work and live together for the sake of the revolution. If we don't restrain our grief and make trouble irrationally, create disunity, it will affect Master Mei's production. What good would that do for the revolution? My wife and I both come from poor families. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, we feel even more that the unity of us workers is essential.
    After a few days, when our hearts were slightly calmer, we felt even more that we should have handled it this way. We have read Chairman Mao's books, learned from Lei Feng, and gone through the Socialist Education Movement, so we understand some revolutionary principles. Master Mei is our class brother, our revolutionary comrade. How can we not emphasize unity! Moreover, the child died accidentally while playing in the water; it wasn't intentional. For the sake of unity among class brothers, we have to let it go, even if it hurts. Compared to the noble acts of many revolutionary parents in the past, who willingly sacrificed their own children to protect "Little Eighth Route Armies," we are far behind.
    After we lost our biological son, we received care from class brothers across the country! The letters from class brothers everywhere contained comrade-like encouragement, parental-like advice, and the hopes of Young Pioneers. They wrote with tears in their eyes, saying that we put the feelings of the working class above the feelings for our own flesh and blood, which is a manifestation of high class consciousness and high revolutionary consciousness. We really can't bear this praise. The responsible comrades of the Hubei Provincial Department of Transportation also came, saying, "We are here to learn from you. To learn from your ability to prioritize class interests and emphasize class feelings in handling matters." They also said, "In the past, when the Red Army climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands, one handful of rice, you let me eat, I let you eat, and finally, we gave it to the sick and wounded. This was the class feeling we talked about during the war. Today, we mutually concede honors, bonuses, conveniences, and even are able to concede in the face of human life. This is the manifestation of class feeling during the construction period." When we heard these words, we were deeply moved. With such an analysis and such elevation, we understood more revolutionary principles.
    We thank the workers brothers from all over the country for their letters. Let us, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, join hands and devote ourselves to the great tasks of the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. Let us use our sturdy hands to build our motherland even stronger, to benefit all revolutionary descendants, and to contribute to the working people of the world!
    We thank the Liberation Army comrades from all over the country for their letters. Let us, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight together and, in different positions, fiercely strike against the ambitious American imperialist aggressors and their big and small running dogs!
    We thank the students and Young Pioneers from all over the country for their letters. Let us, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve our academic and production achievements, and continuously report victories to the Party and the people of the whole country!
    We also thank the family members of some employees for their letters. We hope you will truly become a solid rear area for production, so that our worker brothers can concentrate on fighting the battle of production!
    We must also mention the family of Comrade Sun Qi, an old worker at the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory. They have repeatedly written, wanting to send their thirteen-year-old son (the same age as Jianhua) to our family. We were moved to tears of happiness! Old Brother Sun Qi, in order to comfort and warm his class brothers, is willing to send his own son. This spirit is worth learning from for both of us. This shows that workers all over the world are one family, and all put class feelings above feelings for flesh and blood.
    Since we lost our biological son, Master Mei and Sister-in-law Mei's family have wanted to cut off a piece of their own flesh to repay us. We know their hearts. Some time ago, once while watching a movie, Master Mei noticed that Cheng Chunlan hadn't come and quickly inquired about it. When he heard that Cheng Chunlan had hurt her hand doing cooking work, he rushed over that night to ask about it. We guessed that Sister-in-law Mei would come to help our family with laundry again, so we hid all the clothes that five of us had taken off in the suitcase. Sure enough, early the next morning, Sister-in-law Mei bought sweets and rushed over to express her condolences, and she also found the hidden clothes and washed them. We said, "Sister-in-law Mei, come and see us. It's better than eating anything. We will always be close. Even if we are transferred to work, no matter where we are, we will communicate like a family. We must educate Chongyang and let him grow up healthy, and let him come to our house to play often." Later, we also said to Chongyang, "Jianhua is dead, and no one is helping the younger siblings with their studies. You should fulfill the responsibilities of their older brother!" This child is obedient and is not too shy around us now.
    This year's Spring Festival, our home is truly warm as spring! The responsible comrades of the Provincial Department of Transportation, factory leaders, Master Mei, Sister-in-law Mei, and Chongyang all gathered at our home to celebrate together.
    Although I have lost a biological son, I still have many children of class brothers, and they are the same as our own. As long as they are educated by the Party and by class brothers and sisters, and become good successors to the proletariat, this is the happiness of our working class.
    We have only handled this matter correctly according to Chairman Mao's teachings, but the Party, leaders from all sides, and comrades from all over the country have given us great encouragement. We will never become arrogant because of this. We are still far from meeting the Party's requirements for us, and we still have many shortcomings. In the future, we must persist in studying Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be a revolutionary worker.
    With highest revolutionary salute!

专栏：

    工人阶级的伟大胸怀
    张永安程春兰给各地阶级兄弟的回信
    编者按：我们向读者推荐过《阶级感情千斤重》那篇通讯，今天，我们再推荐张永安、程春兰同志给各地阶级兄弟写的一封回信。他们的事迹在报纸上发表以后，引起了广大读者的反响，多少人去信安慰他们、赞扬他们，有的还去信表示愿把自己的儿子送给他们。从这里看出：在毛泽东时代，出现了多少“阶级感情千斤重”的工人。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”正因为有一个“共同的革命目标”，一切有觉悟的工人、农民以及一切劳动人民，就能够把阶级的利益、集体的利益看得高于一切。我们这种革命的情操、阶级的胸怀，是任何其他阶级都无法比拟的。这种高尚的阶级感情，将推动我们在革命和建设的道路上取得更大的胜利！亲爱的同志们：
    自从《武汉晚报》、《工人日报》上登了我家失去亲生儿子的事情后，北京和其他省市的一些报纸接二连三地登了这件事。几个月来，我家收到祖国四面八方阶级兄弟的来信，有时一天收到一二十封，安慰我们，鼓励我们。真是字字值千金，句句是力量呵！
    我们是双职工，总是利用吃饭或睡觉前的时间读信。有时，我们的爹爹说：“等下念吧，饭都凉啦。”我们怎么能等呢，阶级兄弟的来信，不读完过不得！祖国遥远的边疆有位同志是半夜里爬起来给我家写信来的啊！这些来信，使我们得到了无穷的力量！
    头几天，我俩在灯下给祖国四面八方的阶级兄弟们回信，写呀写呀，好多话在心里打滚，就是文化低写不出来呀！后来一商量，就在报纸上，尽自己的认识，总的回一封信吧！
    我们失去亲生儿子的那天，心里确实疼不过，走路踉踉跄跄，头都昏了。但是，有一点心里是明白的：人死了不能活回来。这是没有法的事，决不能给梅师傅一家加上痛苦和损失。我家和梅家，都不是武汉人，都是为革命来到一块工作、住在一起的。要是我们不忍住悲痛，去瞎胡闹，闹不团结，就会影响梅师傅的生产，这对革命有什么好处呢？我们夫妇都出身在苦寒人家，想想从前，比比现在，越发觉得我们工人的团结要紧。
    过了几天，心里稍为平静些，就越发觉得我们应该这样处理。我们读过毛主席的书，又学了雷锋，经过社会主义教育运动，懂得了一些革命道理。梅师傅是我们的阶级兄弟，是革命同志，我们怎能不讲团结！再说，孩子是伢们玩水失手误死的，又不是人家有意搞的，为了阶级兄弟的团结，舍不得也得舍。这比起从前许多革命父母，为了掩护“小八路”，甘心把亲生子舍出去的高尚行为，我们还差得远。
    我们失去了这个亲生儿子，受到了祖国各地阶级兄弟的关怀！各地阶级兄弟的来信，有同志般的鼓励，有父母般的嘱咐，有少先队员的希望。他们含着热泪写信来，说我们把工人阶级感情放在儿女骨肉感情之上，是阶级觉悟高，革命觉悟高的表现。我们实在担当不起。湖北省交通厅的负责同志也来了，他说：“我们是来向你们学习的。学习你们处理事情能以阶级利益为重，讲阶级感情。”又说：“过去红军爬雪山过草地，一把米，你让我吃，我让你吃，最后让给伤病员吃，这是打仗时期讲的阶级感情；今天我们互相让荣誉、让奖金、让方便，甚至在人命面前也能让，这是建设时期讲阶级感情的表现。”我们一听这话，很受感动。这么一分析，一提高，我们又明白了更多的革命道理。
    我们感谢各地工人兄弟的来信。让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，并肩携手，投入第三个五年计划第一年的伟大任务中去，用我们粗壮的双手，把我们的祖国建设得更强大，为全体革命后代造福，为世界劳动人民贡献力量吧！
    我们感谢各地解放军同志的来信。让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，共同战斗，在不同的岗位上，对野心勃勃的美帝国主义侵略者和他们的大小走狗，狠狠地进行打击吧！
    我们感谢各地学生、少先队员的来信。让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，使学习成绩和生产成绩不断上升，不断地向党和全国人民报捷吧！
    我们还感谢一些职工家属的来信。愿你们真正成为生产的巩固后方，使我们的工人兄弟，能够集中精力打好生产仗！
    我们还要提到的是哈尔滨电机厂老工人孙启同志一家，他们再三来信，要把他们十三岁的（和建华同岁的）男孩子送给我家。我们感动得流下了幸福的眼泪！孙启老大哥，为了使阶级兄弟得到安慰，得到温暖，甘愿把亲生子送出来。这种精神，值得我俩好好学习。这说明天下工人是一家，都是把阶级感情放在骨肉感情之上。
    自从我们失去亲生儿子以后，梅和清师傅一家人恨不得割下身上肉来还我们。他们的心我们是知道的。前些时，有一次看电影，梅师傅发现程春兰没有来，连忙打听，听说是程春兰搞炊事工作把手打了，连夜赶来问候。我们估计梅嫂又会来帮我一家人洗衣服，便把五个人换下的衣服通通藏在箱子里。果然，第二天一早，梅嫂买了糖果赶来慰问，把藏的衣服也找出洗了。我们说：“梅嫂，你来看看，比吃什么都好。我们永远要亲亲热热的。以后就是调动工作，天南地北，也要象一家人一样通信来往，对重阳要教育，让他健康成长，让他常来我家玩玩。”后来，我们又对重阳说：“建华死了，小弟弟小妹妹的学习没人帮助，你就尽他们大哥生前的责任吧！”这孩子还听话，现在见我们也不太拘束了。
    今年春节，我们家真正温暖如春！省交通厅负责同志、工厂领导同志和梅师傅、梅嫂、重阳都到我家团聚一堂。
    我虽然失去了一个亲生的儿子，但还有许许多多的阶级兄弟的子女，他们也就和我们自己的一样。只要他们在党的教育下，在阶级兄弟姐妹的教育下，当好无产阶级的接班人，这就是咱们工人阶级的幸福。
    我们只是按照毛主席的教导，正确地处理了这件事，可是，党、各方面领导和全国各地的同志们却给了我们极大的鼓舞，我们决不因此骄傲起来。现在我们同党对我们的要求相比还差得很远，我们还存在很多缺点，今后，一定要坚持学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，做个革命化的工人。　此致崇高的革命敬礼！
