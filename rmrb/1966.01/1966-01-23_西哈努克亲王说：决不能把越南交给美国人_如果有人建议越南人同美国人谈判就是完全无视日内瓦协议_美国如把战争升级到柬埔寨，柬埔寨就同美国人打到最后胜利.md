    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 21st (Dispatch) Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, stated at a press conference he hosted on the 21st that Vietnam should belong to the Vietnamese people, and must never be handed over to the Americans. He said that the aggressor is not Vietnam; the Vietnamese are not invading Vietnam, but the United States is invading Vietnam, therefore the United States must get out of Vietnam!
    Prince Sihanouk made these remarks while discussing the recent "peace offensive" launched by the United States.
    He said: The Americans are waving an olive branch on the one hand, while on the other hand, they are single-mindedly seeking to destroy Vietnam through new war budgets and constant escalation. They are constantly sending in more troops and landing them, attempting to destroy Vietnam even more thoroughly. They are clamoring to use atomic weapons to destroy China. They even want to wipe out Cambodia. Is this the premise for peace?
    He pointed out that since the United States has already violated the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, what "peace" is there to talk about?
    Prince Sihanouk said that the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue told the Vietnamese people: your houses belong entirely to you, and no one may break into your homes, but now the Americans have broken into the homes of the Vietnamese people. At this moment, if you want to force the Vietnamese to negotiate peace in their own homes, if you say to the Vietnamese: now you negotiate with the Americans to divide the property in this house! This is impossible. Prince Sihanouk emphasized that under such circumstances, one can only force the robbers to get out of the homeowner's house. He said that this is exactly what North Vietnam is now demanding, and it is also exactly what the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is now demanding. They only ask people to uphold justice, distinguish between who is the aggressor and who is the aggressed, who is the robber and who is the robbed, who is the occupied and who is the occupier; they demand that the occupiers get out of the homeland they occupy. They ask people to help in this regard, to directly tell the Americans to get out of South Vietnam and not allow the United States to touch Vietnam. This is what must be done.
    He said that if anyone suggests that the Vietnamese negotiate with the Americans, it would be a fundamental disregard of the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, and it would also be a blatant contempt for the people's right to self-determination.
    Prince Sihanouk emphasized that the solution to the Vietnam problem is: the Americans must withdraw their armed forces and dismantle their military bases from South Vietnam, not interfere in the affairs of the South Vietnamese people, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems.
    Speaking of the United States' clamor to attack China, Prince Sihanouk said, "This is utterly ridiculous, because China has never attacked anyone, and experience has proven that provoking China yields nothing."
    Prince Sihanouk reiterated: If the Americans bomb Cambodia and gradually escalate the war to Cambodia, we will defend ourselves, we will fight the Americans until final victory is achieved. He expressed his belief that the people of Indochina will surely achieve final victory because the people who defend the independence of their own countries are invincible.
    Speaking of U.S. aid, Prince Sihanouk pointed out that since Cambodia rejected U.S. aid, "Cambodia's economic situation has greatly improved."
    He pointed out: "Since we rejected U.S. aid two years ago, our situation has been obviously very good... our Riel (Cambodia's currency unit) is more stable than the currencies of most of America's client states in Asia." He pointed out: "Our foreign trade originally had a deficit of 1,680,256,000 Riels; after rejecting U.S. 'aid' in 1964, there was a surplus of 958,018,000 Riels; in 1965, there was a surplus of 721,782,000 Riels. At the same time, our exports increased from 1,902,593,000 Riels to 3,276,564,000 Riels."
    Prince Sihanouk also spoke of Cambodia's national construction achievements and the people's welfare, and condemned the United States for not allowing others to adopt independent economic policies.

    西哈努克亲王说：决不能把越南交给美国人
    如果有人建议越南人同美国人谈判就是完全无视日内瓦协议
    美国如把战争升级到柬埔寨，柬埔寨就同美国人打到最后胜利
    新华社金边二十一日电  柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十一日在他主持的记者招待会上说，越南应该属于越南人，决不能把越南交给美国人。他说，侵略者不是越南，不是越南人在侵略越南，而是美国在侵略越南，因此美国必须从越南滚出去！
    西哈努克亲王是在谈到美国最近发动的“和平攻势”时说这番话的。
    他说：美国人一方面摇晃橄榄枝，另一方面却一味通过新的战争预算，不断升级，力图摧毁越南。他们不断增派军队登陆，要更加彻底地破坏越南。他们扬言，要用原子武器摧毁中国。他们甚至还要把柬埔寨消灭掉。这是和平的前提么？
    他指出，美国既然已经破坏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，还谈得上什么“和平”？
    西哈努克亲王说，一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议对越南人说：你们的房屋完全属于你们，任何人都不得闯进你们的家门，而现在美国人已经闯进了越南人的家门，在这种时刻，如果你们要迫使越南人在他们家里谈判和平，如果你们对越南人说：现在你们同美国人谈判瓜分这所房里的财物吧！这是办不到的。西哈努克亲王强调说，在这种情况下，只能迫使强盗滚出主人的家门。他说，北越现在所要求的正是这样，越南南方民族解放阵线现在所要求的也正是这样。他们只要求人们主持正义，分清谁是被侵略者和谁是侵略者，谁是强盗和谁是被抢劫者，谁是被占领者和谁是占领者，他们要求占领者从他们所占领的家园滚出去。他们要求人们在这方面帮忙，直截了当地叫美国人从南越滚出去，不准美国触碰越南。这就是必须做的事情。
    他说，如果有人建议越南人同美国人谈判，那就是从根本上完全无视一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，也是公然蔑视人民的自决权。
    西哈努克亲王强调说，解决越南问题的办法是：美国人必须从南越撤走他们的武装部队和撤除他们的军事基地，不干涉南越人的事情，让越南人自己解决自己的问题。
    在谈到美国扬言要进攻中国时，西哈努克亲王说，“这是十分可笑的，因为中国从来没有进攻任何人，而且经验证明，对中国进行挑衅，是什么也捞不到的。”
    西哈努克亲王重申：如果美国人轰炸柬埔寨，并且把战争逐步升级到柬埔寨，我们就进行自卫，我们就同美国人打，直到取得最后胜利。他表示相信，印度支那人民一定会取得最后胜利，因为保卫自己国家的独立的人民是不可战胜的。
    西哈努克亲王在谈到美援时指出，自从柬埔寨拒绝美援以来，“柬埔寨的经济情况大大好转。”
    他指出：“自从我们拒绝美援之后的两年来，我国的情况显然很好……我们的瑞尔（柬埔寨的货币单位）比美国在亚洲的大多数仆从国家的货币更加巩固。”他指出：“我国的对外贸易原先入超十六亿八千零二十五万六千瑞尔；一九六四年拒绝美‘援’以后，出超九亿五千八百零一万八千瑞尔；一九六五年出超七亿二千一百七十八万二千瑞尔。同时，我们的出口从十九亿零二百五十九万三千瑞尔增加到三十二亿七千六百五十六万四千瑞尔。”
    西哈努克亲王最后还谈到柬埔寨国家建设成就和人民福利的情况，并且谴责了美国不容许别人采取独立的经济政策。
