    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 10th (via Cambodian News Agency, January 9th) - Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk pointed out in a speech at the 22nd Congress of Cambodian Buddhists on January 7th that everyone thoroughly detests U.S. imperialism because it is truly detestable. The main reason why the United States is hated by the people of the world is that it pursues imperialism and neo-colonialism.

    Prince Sihanouk said: "In order to save face, the United States arbitrarily defines our anti-Americanism. It insists that this anti-Americanism, even in its strongest form, is merely a play staged to please our powerful, 'fearsome' neighbor, China. According to the Americans, we don't really hate them at all, but only pretend to hate them to please our 'feared' Chinese." He continued, "Let's take the Latin American countries as an example. These countries are geographically very far from China, so there is no question of fearing China. However, these countries also vehemently criticized the United States in Havana. And the Japanese people, who are resolutely anti-American, despite their government pursuing a contrary policy, cannot be said to be doing so to please the Chinese." He pointed out that the truth is that everyone thoroughly detests U.S. imperialism because it is truly detestable.

    Speaking of U.S. aid, Prince Sihanouk said, "We have tasted the bitterness of U.S. aid, which is bitter and even poisonous. The Americans have desperately undermined our neutrality. They play a double game, paying lip service to respecting our neutrality while simultaneously instigating their newspapers, their Thai lackeys, South Vietnamese lackeys, and 'Free Khmer' elements to create all sorts of difficulties for us, attempting to make us abandon our neutrality." He said, "The Americans have never formally recognized our territorial integrity, and have always allowed our neighbors to forcibly extort Cambodia's coastal islands and other lands." He continued, "Now that there are no Americans here, they can no longer expect us to ally with them, so they create various pretexts to launch aggression against us."

    He said, "In short, these are some of the reasons why we thoroughly hate the Americans, and it is not at all about 'acting' to please our Chinese brothers."

    Speaking of the intensified aggression against the Cambodian border, Prince Sihanouk condemned U.S. imperialism for allowing Thailand and South Vietnam, as well as "Free Khmer" elements, to attack Cambodia from all sides. He said, "However, our swift and resolute reaction made them reconsider, and they retreated." He said, "Our enemies can never overwhelm us, because despite their outward appearance of strength, they are actually weak and fearful. As for us, we have taken all self-defense measures; we are determined to sacrifice our lives, and we know that final victory will surely belong to us."

    He said that Cambodia stands with the peoples of all countries suffering from U.S. imperialism. In this way, Cambodia shows all these countries that it is not selfishly concerned only with its own problems, and in this regard, it remains true to its belief that only through universal mutual support can U.S. imperialism be defeated. He said, "The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are now unanimously demanding that the United States stop acting as a king in the world."

    Speaking of the recent clash between Cambodians and "Free Khmer" elements, Prince Sihanouk said, "We found the bodies of enemies wearing American military uniforms and hand grenades made in Formosa, which clearly shows that the 'Free Khmer' elements are not acting alone."

    Speaking of the "Asia Foundation," Prince Sihanouk said, "This is the only American organization currently in our country, but many of our compatriots suspect that the CIA is using it, especially since it persists in staying in Cambodia despite the growing hostility of the Cambodian government and people, which seems to confirm this suspicion. We do not want an American fifth column within our country."

    西哈努克亲王说各国人民互相声援能够打败美帝国主义
    柬埔寨坚决同受美帝之害的人民站在一起
    新华社金边十日电  据柬埔寨新闻社九日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王一月七日在柬埔寨佛教徒第二十二次代表大会上发表讲话时指出，大家都恨透了美帝国主义，因为它实在可恨。美国遭到全世界人民痛恨的主要原因，就是它奉行帝国主义和新殖民主义。
    西哈努克亲王说：“美国为了保全面子，任意给我们的反美下定义，它硬说，这种反美，即使是最强烈的表现，也始终只是为了讨好我们强大的、‘可怕的’邻邦中国而排演的一出戏。照美国人的这种说法，我们根本就不痛恨美国人，只是假装痛恨他们，以讨好我们‘害怕’的中国人。”他接着说：“我们且以拉丁美洲国家为例，这些国家从地理上来说，距中国非常遥远，因而根本谈不上害怕中国，然而这些国家在哈瓦那也猛烈抨击美国。又例如日本人民，他们是坚决反美的，尽管他们的政府是奉行一种相反的政策，总不能说日本人民这样做是为了讨好中国人。”他指出，因此，真实情况是，大家都恨透了美帝国主义，因为它实在可恨。
    西哈努克亲王在谈到美援时说：“我们已经吃过美援的苦头，这种援助是苦的、甚至是有毒的。美国人拼命破坏我国的中立，他们玩弄两面手法，一方面在口头上说得天花乱坠，说尊重我国的中立，而同时却唆使他们的报刊、他们的泰国走狗、南越走狗以及‘自由高棉’分子给我们制造各种各样的困难，企图使我们放弃中立。”他说：“美国人从来没有正式承认我国的领土完整，一直放手让我国的邻居强行勒索柬埔寨的沿海岛屿和其他土地。”他接着指出：“现在我们这里已经没有美国人，他们再也不能指望我们同他们结盟，于是制造各种借口，以便对我们发动侵略。”
    他说：“总之，这就是我们所以恨透了美国人的一些原因，根本不是什么为讨好我们的中国兄弟而‘演戏’。”
    西哈努克亲王在谈到对柬埔寨边境的加紧侵略时，谴责美帝国主义让泰国和南越，还有“自由高棉”分子放手从各个方面进攻柬埔寨。他说：“但是，我们迅速而坚定的反应使他们考虑了一下，他们退却了。”他说：“我们的敌人决不可能压倒我们，因为他们尽管外表上有力量，但是实际上是虚弱和恐惧的。至于我们，我们已经采取了一切自卫步骤；我们一方面决心不惜牺牲我们的生命，同时我们知道最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    他说，柬埔寨同受美帝国主义之害的各国人民站在一起。这样，柬埔寨就向所有这些国家表明柬埔寨不是自私自利地只想到自己的问题的，在这方面，它始终忠于自己的如下信念：只有通过普遍的互相声援的行动才能打败美帝国主义。他说：“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民现在异口同声要求美国停止在世界上称王称霸。”
    西哈努克亲王在谈到最近柬埔寨人同“自由高棉”分子交火时说：“我们发现穿美国军服的敌人尸体和福摩萨制造的手榴弹，这清楚地表明，‘自由高棉’分子并不是单独行事的。”
    西哈努克亲王谈到“亚洲基金会”时说：“这是现在在我国的仅有的美国组织，但是我国许多同胞怀疑中央情报局在利用它，特别是它不顾柬埔寨政府和人民日益增长的敌对情绪而赖在柬埔寨不走，看来证实了这种怀疑。我们不希望在我国国内有一个美国第五纵队。”
