    Fighting requires battlefields, and the cultural revolution also needs battlefields. Cultural centers are the battlefields of the rural cultural revolution. We must occupy this battlefield, expand this battlefield, resolutely oppose feudalist and bourgeois ideologies, defeat them, and replace them, to ensure the complete victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The articles and poems published here fully demonstrate that the cultural revolution must wage a tit-for-tat struggle. The revolutionary new socialist culture, in just one clash with the old culture, sends all demons and monsters fleeing in disarray. The peasant masses use new stories to defeat old stories, new operas to defeat old operas, and new songs to defeat old songs, demonstrating the power of revolutionary new culture. Comrades in cultural centers everywhere, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be disseminators of revolutionary new culture, propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, shock troops charging forward in the socialist cultural revolution, and achieve the complete victory of the rural cultural revolution. —Editor

    Let Revolutionary Mountain Songs Ring Out

    In the Chunqiu Brigade of Luoshan County, Henan Province, farmers have a tradition of singing antiphonal songs. Every year during the seasons of transplanting rice, operating waterwheels, and cutting rice seedlings, singing can be heard everywhere. However, before liberation, the mountain songs that were passed down were mostly old, with most of the ideological content being unhealthy, seriously corrupting the minds of young people and hindering production. In response to this situation, the Party branch organized young people to compose and sing new mountain songs on a large scale, to occupy this important ideological battlefield.

    From then on, young people often gathered together to compose and sing mountain songs. The new songs became louder and more joyful. The young people decided to confront the old mountain songs head-on and compete to see which was better.

    The song competition began. People weeding in the paddy fields lined up in two rows. On one side was the new mountain song team, and on the other side was the old mountain song team. The old mountain song team fired the first shot:

    As I step into the field,
    My foot touches a big water chestnut.
    With delicate fingertips, I pick it up,
    First nip off the stem, then wash off the mud,
    And flip it into my sister's mouth.

    Hu Mingzhu (a member of the Communist Youth League) from the new mountain song team immediately countered with the first song:

    As I step into the field, I open my mouth,
    And let revolutionary mountain songs ring out.
    Labor creates a new world,
    Food and clothing all come from the collective,
    Flowers of happiness bloom everywhere.

    Before the song ended, old poor peasant Bi Guoping pointed at the people singing old mountain songs and said, "They are singing about the goodness of labor and the collective, but you are singing love songs, leading people astray!"

    Seeing that singing love songs was being opposed, the people singing old mountain songs changed their tune and sang about ancient figures. Old farmer Bi Jiasheng sang:

    Let's talk about ancient people,
    Among the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, Zhao Yun is number one.
    He rescued his lord at Changban Slope,
    Single-handedly drove back Cao Cao's million soldiers,
    And protected Liu Bei as he ascended the throne.

    Bi Yandeng, Bi Jiasheng's son and a member of the Communist Youth League, immediately sang a song in response to his father:

    Father sings of the past, I sing of the present,
    I sing of the hero Qiu Shaoyun.
    The enemy dropped an incendiary bomb,
    Flames engulf his body, but his heart remains unchanged,
    He dedicates his youth to the cause of the Party.

    Everyone listened and commented, "Although Zhao Yun was brave, he protected a feudal emperor on the throne. What kind of hero is that? Qiu Shaoyun sacrificed his life for the cause of the Party and is a truly upright hero! New songs are still better than old songs." At this time, the woman Chen Shunqing also spoke, "I speak on behalf of the women: we women want new songs, not old songs. Those vulgar mountain songs of the past really hurt our ears." These words caused several people who liked to sing obscene mountain songs to blush with embarrassment. At this moment, the team leader, Bi Guolian, said, "Those who are willing to join in singing new mountain songs, please stand on this side!" Before he finished speaking, people from the old mountain song team flocked to the new mountain song team, leaving only four old mountain song enthusiasts on the other side. After hesitating for a while, they had no choice but to walk over dispiritedly.

    In this song competition, some people who liked to sing old mountain songs did not participate. When they heard that the new mountain song team had won, they were very unconvinced and were determined to compete with the young people. So, another song competition began.

    One night, by the big pond drawing water, just as several young people had finished singing a new mountain song, Liu Fayou sarcastically said, "You've only learned a few songs, and you're singing them here and there. If you want to sing, let's sing one-on-one!" Then, in a challenging tone, he sang:

    Singing should still be of ancient songs,
    The gong should still be a Suzhou gong,
    An official should still be Bao Zheng,
    A commander should still be Lady Yang,
    Who is Lady Yang afraid of when she goes into battle!

    The young people were, of course, unwilling to give in. Liu Fayou's nephew, Hu Mingzhu, immediately countered by singing:

    Uncle sings of old antiques,
    I sing of red lanterns hanging on high mountains.
    Chairman Mao is like a lamp,
    Shining red across the mountains and seas,
    The people live in happiness.

    Under a willow tree not far from the waterwheel, an old woman in her seventies, Huang Fuming, was sitting there enjoying the cool air. When everyone took a break, she said, "I heard all the songs you were singing. Saying Bao Zheng and Lady Yang are good, none of us have ever seen them. The benefits Chairman Mao has given us are endless. No matter how well you sing ancient songs, you can't sing a good life." These words made the people singing old mountain songs feel very ashamed. But they were still not willing to admit defeat. Then, Liu Fayou and others began to sing the "Five Watches of Love" mountain song, and Hu Mingzhu and others countered with "Five Watches Thinking of Beijing"; Liu Fayou and others sang "Old Four Directions," and they countered with "New Four Directions"; Liu Fayou and others sang "Four Ancient People," and they countered with "Singing of Four Revolutionary Heroes." They sang for half the night. Liu Fayou and his group had run out of songs, but Hu Mingzhu and the others were composing and singing as they went, singing with more and more energy. The people singing old mountain songs lost again. Liu Fayou said, "You young people have the ability. I am truly convinced and will learn from you."

    After several song competitions, the new songs defeated the old songs. Revolutionary new mountain songs spread everywhere. The commune members sing mountain songs as they go out, and sing mountain songs as they go to the fields. The revolutionary mountain songs make people feel refreshed and invigorated. Old poor peasant Bi Zhengyi, who is seventy-one years old, said, "Singing old songs makes people feel drowsy, but singing new mountain songs makes people feel young."

专栏：

    打仗要有阵地，文化革命也要有阵地。文化室就是农村文化革命的阵地。我们要占领这个阵地，扩大这个阵地，坚决反对封建主义思想和资产阶级思想，战而胜之，取而代之，以保证社会主义革命和社会主义建设的彻底胜利。这里发表的几篇文章和一些诗歌，充分说明了文化革命必须开展针锋相对的斗争。社会主义的革命新文化和旧文化只一交锋，便打得牛鬼蛇神落荒而去。农民群众用新故事比垮旧故事，用新戏比垮旧戏，用新歌比垮旧歌，显示了革命新文化的威力。各地文化室的同志们，让我们高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，做革命新文化的传播者，毛泽东思想的宣传员，社会主义文化革命中冲锋陷阵的闯将，取得农村文化革命的彻底胜利。　编者
    革命山歌唱起来
    河南省罗山县春秋大队地区，农民有对歌的习惯，每年插秧、车水、打秧草等农活季节，到处一片歌声。可是，解放前，流传下来的都是旧山歌，思想内容不健康的占大多数，严重地腐蚀着青年人的思想，也妨碍了生产。针对这种情况，党支部让青年人组织起来，大编大唱新山歌，占领这个重要的思想阵地。
    从此，青年人经常在一起，编山歌，唱山歌，新歌越唱越响，越唱越欢，青年们决定与旧山歌针锋相对，比个高低。
    赛歌开始了，秧田里锄草的人排成两行，这边是新山歌队，那边是旧山歌队，旧山歌队开了第一炮：
    一下田来把脚移，
    一脚踩个大荸荠，
    十指尖尖来拣起，
    先掐蒂来后洗泥，
    翻手丢到姐嘴里。
    新山歌队的胡明珠（团员）接着回击了第一首：
    一下田来把口开，
    革命山歌唱起来，
    劳动创造新世界，
    吃穿都从集体来，
    幸福花儿朵朵开。歌声未落，老贫农毕国平就指着唱旧山歌的人说：“人家唱劳动好、集体好，你们却唱调情歌，叫人走邪路！”
    唱旧山歌的看到唱调情歌遭到人们反对，就改口唱古人歌。老农毕家胜唱道：
    提起古人唱古人，
    三国英雄数赵云，
    长板坡前来救主，
    独退曹操百万兵，
    保着刘备坐朝廷。
    毕家胜的儿子毕延登是团员，当场和父亲对起歌来：
    父亲唱古我唱今，
    唱个英雄邱少云，
    敌人投下燃烧弹，
    烈火烧身不变心，
    为党事业献青春。大家听了议论说：“赵云虽勇，但保的是封建帝王坐朝廷，算得什么英雄；邱少云为了党的事业献出生命，才是真正顶天立地的英雄！新歌还是比旧歌好。”这时候，妇女陈顺清也发了言：“我代表妇女说句话，我们妇女要新歌不要旧歌。过去唱的那些下流的山歌，实在刺我们的耳朵。”说得几个爱唱黄色山歌的人脸红脖子粗。这时，队长毕国连说：“愿意参加唱新山歌的请站到这边来！”一句话没有说完，旧山歌队的人纷纷向新山歌队走来，那边只剩下四个旧山歌迷了。他们迟疑了一会，也只好没精打采地走了过来。
    这次对歌，还有几个爱唱旧山歌的人没有参加，他们听说新山歌队赛赢了，很不服气，一心要和青年们较量较量。于是，另一场赛歌又开始了。
    一天夜晚，在大塘边车水，几个青年刚刚唱完一首新山歌，柳发友就讽刺说：“你们才学了几个歌，就这里唱那里唱，要唱咱们一对一地唱！”接着，他以挑战的口气唱起来：
    唱歌还是古人歌，
    打锣还是苏州锣，
    做官还是包文正，
    出阵还是杨令婆，
    令婆出阵怕谁个！
    青年们当然不肯让步，柳发友的外甥胡明珠即时顶上去唱道：
    舅舅唱的老古董，
    我唱高山挂红灯，
    毛主席好比灯一盏，
    山南海北都照红，
    人民长在幸福中。
    离水车不远的柳树下，有一位七十多岁的老大娘黄福明在那里乘凉，等大家休息的时候，她就说：“你们唱的歌我都听着了。说包文正、杨令婆好，咱们谁也没见到。毛主席给咱们的好处说也说不完。要不是共产党和毛主席的领导，我这无依无靠的人，哪有今天这样幸福的生活。唱古人歌再唱得好，也唱不来好生活。”说得几个唱旧山歌的人非常惭愧。但他们还是不服输，接着柳发友等又唱起《五更调情》山歌，胡明珠等就对以《五更想北京》；柳发友等唱《老四方》，他们就对以《新四方》；柳发友等唱《四古人》，他们就对以《歌唱革命四英雄》。唱了半夜，柳发友他们的歌也唱完了，可是胡明珠等则边编边唱，越唱越有劲，唱旧山歌的又输了。柳发友说：“你们青年们有办法，我真算服了气，向你们学习。”
    经过几场对歌，新歌比垮了旧歌。革命的新山歌到处流传。社员们唱着山歌走出门，唱着山歌走下田，革命的山歌唱得人们精神焕发，干劲倍增。七十一岁的老贫农毕正一说：“唱旧歌唱得人昏昏沉沉，新山歌一唱，把人唱得年轻了。”
