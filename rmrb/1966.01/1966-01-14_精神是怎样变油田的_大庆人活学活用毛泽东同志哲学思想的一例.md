Editor's Note: Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for our country's socialist revolution, and also the guide for our country's socialist construction. Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for the class struggle of our people to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. It is also the guide for our people to wage war against the earth and conduct the struggle for production and scientific experiment. This conclusion has been repeatedly proven by countless facts. The vivid story of the Daqing people's exploration, development, and construction of the large oilfield reported in the newsletter "How Spiritual Power Transforms into an Oilfield" provides another new proof.

Today in China, studying Mao Zedong's philosophical works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," learning and mastering materialist dialectics, has become the revolutionary demand and common action of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought is conscientiously and actively studied and applied, wherever Mao Zedong Thought is combined with the work of the local area and department and made specific, there is a living materialist dialectics to correctly understand things, analyze contradictions, and solve problems. Philosophy is no longer a plaything in the hands of a few. Philosophy is in a historical era of unprecedented liberation, becoming a spiritual weapon that can be learned and used by the broad masses of people. The construction of the Daqing Oilfield is not only a victory in applying Mao Zedong's theory of class struggle, but also a victory in applying Mao Zedong's philosophical thought.

The entire process of the Daqing Oilfield, from lack of knowledge to knowledge, from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, is full of the struggle of materialist dialectics against idealism and metaphysics. In this struggle, the Daqing people insisted on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a lively way, and finally overcame one difficulty after another in the field of cognition, achieving a great victory in emancipating the mind. To learn from Daqing, we must learn this point, draw spiritual strength from it, and more consciously grasp Mao Zedong's philosophical thought tightly in our own hands, so as to more smoothly realize the leap from matter to spirit, from spirit to matter, and the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom, and truly become the masters of our own destiny.

How did the Daqing people use Chairman Mao's philosophical thought to guide the development of the oilfield? Below is a vivid and conclusive example.

"Understanding the Overall Situation Will Make It Easier to Use the Partial Situation"

Oilfields and oil layers are deeply buried underground, invisible and untouchable. Where to start finding an oilfield?

Foreign methods include drilling "wildcat wells," relying on "chance encounters," and trying luck. Others "circle the edge," looking for "eggs," and drilling wherever they see oil traces. They do not start with a comprehensive investigation of an area to select the most favorable zone, but instead, they immediately rely on individual, limited data and confine themselves to drilling in one or two local spots. This metaphysical method of sticking to one spot, only caring about the part and not the whole, can only delay the time to discover and take down the oilfield.

The exploration of the Daqing Oilfield completely broke the foreign framework and created a unique Chinese-style exploration path. Based on a large amount of general survey and exploration work, according to Chairman Mao's thought that "understanding the overall situation will make it easier to use the partial situation," the relationship between the part and the whole was correctly handled, and a comprehensive and thorough investigation and study were conducted. From the very beginning, comprehensive surveys were conducted throughout the region using a variety of methods. After comprehensive analysis and research, the distribution of underground structures was gradually clarified, the favorable zones for oil and gas were identified, and oil-bearing structures were discovered, so that exploration work could be carried out with analysis, comparison, selection, and purpose. As a result, favorable areas were accurately selected, the main attack direction was determined, and drilling forces were deployed, leading to the relatively rapid discovery of the Daqing Oilfield.

The metaphysical method disregards actual geological conditions and unilaterally stipulates that, regardless of the region or oilfield, only a small amount of exploratory well data should be used at any stage to draw a complete conclusion about a structure. The Daqing Oilfield broke the foreign "framework" and implemented the dialectic of combining the local and the whole, resulting in results that were faster, cheaper, and more accurate than theirs.

"Systematically and Thoroughly Study the Surrounding Environment"

Now that the oilfield had been found, the next question was how to understand the underground situation of this oilfield. Daqing Oilfield workers, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on seeking truth from facts, investigation and research, and systematically and thoroughly studying the surrounding environment, vehemently opposed the bad habits of ignoring objective reality and not valuing primary data. They emphasized that to understand the oilfield situation, a large number of facts must be grasped, a large amount of data must be possessed, and a large number of repeated analyses must be conducted. They proposed to firmly grasp primary data to lay the foundation for understanding the oilfield. Through mass discussions, it was decided that throughout the entire process from drilling to development, twenty items of data and seventy-two figures must be collected completely and accurately.

Initially, a geologist from one well missed collecting rock samples during the drilling process and failed to discover the standard layer. A week-long meeting was held throughout the oilfield to seriously educate people about this matter. The oilfield leadership attached great importance to learning from the lessons of failure. Since "tuition" had been paid, everyone had to remember this lesson firmly. After the significance of clarifying the underground situation for better oilfield development was grasped by the broad masses, a mass movement to vigorously collect primary data was launched throughout the oilfield.

Taking rock cores from underground for analysis and testing is an important method for understanding oil layers. Daqing comrades often use the example of Fang Yonghua's team from the 2349 Drilling Team to illustrate the problem. One day, this team was taking rock cores from the well, and a small section accidentally fell to the bottom of the well due to careless operation. When the team leader, Fang Yonghua, saw the small section of rock core fall to the bottom of the well, he was very heartbroken. He held the core barrel and sat down on the well site, saying, "If the core is missing an inch, there will be one less scientific basis for judging the geological conditions, and there will be one more difficulty in geological work. If the rock core that fell into the well cannot be retrieved, we will owe the country a debt."

The workers were determined to retrieve the lost core from the bottom of the well. The captain advised them to go back to rest, but they refused. The instructor brought steamed buns and dumplings to the well site and urged them to eat, but they said, "We won't enjoy eating or sleeping until the task is completed." They worked continuously for more than twenty hours and finally retrieved a complete rock core.

Some foreigners asserted, "Retrieving rock cores from underground generally yields a maximum of 50% to 65%." In fact, the core recovery rate in some of their oilfields was only 30% to 40%. However, the Daqing Oilfield fully mobilized human initiative, mobilized the masses, and relied on the masses, greatly increasing the core recovery rate, advancing year after year. Some drilling teams have been able to retrieve rock cores from underground with 100% recovery.

The Bankruptcy of "Agnosticism"

The leaders of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry clearly stated to the Daqing workers from the very beginning: "Those engaged in natural oil have their work posts underground, and their struggle object is the oil layer."

A foreign geologist once proposed nine major difficulties in oil layer comparison. They believed that the underground situation could only be known approximately, and it was unimaginable to understand it clearly.

The comrades of the Daqing Oilfield believed that the distribution of oil is always regular. This regularity can be understood. The key lies in giving full play to the human factor and conducting in-depth research using the method of dialectical materialism.

During the oil layer research process, people carefully observed and repeatedly studied all the extracted rock cores, section by section, specifically analyzing the commonalities and unique features of each well, and finding out the internal connections and changes among them. After thousands of comparisons and analyses, they finally mastered the oil layer regularity and creatively developed the formation comparison method. Using this method, they conducted more than 27 million formation comparisons on the oil layer data of all oil wells in the entire oilfield, clarified the conditions of each oil layer, and pioneered a brand-new path for oil layer research.

While conducting a large amount of oil layer comparison, they also conducted a large number of analyses and tests. Their principle was "rather have too much than too little." The conditions for analysis and testing were very difficult at the time. Without running water, they installed earthen water towers and carried water to persist in doing the testing. Over the course of three years, they carried more than 100,000 loads of water with shoulder poles and analyzed more than 70,000 samples.

Geological and testing personnel built earthen houses on the well site, moved the laboratory to the well site, vigorously engaged in "three combinations," carefully pondered and researched, and solved one hundred and one problems that might affect the accuracy of the analysis. In the past, technical cadres felt that things not found in books were "difficult." By engaging in "three combinations" on the site, many problems that were difficult in the past became easy.

The iron facts completely shattered agnosticism. Daqing workers started from the objective existence of things and derived the inherent laws of the oilfield, so that it was as if they had walked through the oilfield underground. It was relatively clear which oil layer was thick, which oil layer was thin, which oil layer had strong pressure, which oil layer had weak pressure, which oil layer had good connectivity, and which oil layer had poor connectivity.

"Any Contradiction Should Not Only Be Resolved, But Is Also Completely Resolvable."

Oil can be sprayed from the deep underground entirely relying on the pressure of the oil layer. Once the oil layer loses pressure, the oil well will stop self-flowing, and the live oilfield will become a dead oilfield.

As oil is continuously extracted from the underground, the pressure of the oil layer will continue to decline, just like a deflated ball. So how to maintain the oil layer pressure? After systematically studying the development history of more than twenty foreign oilfields, they learned that they generally rely on natural capacity for extraction first. After extracting for a period of time, when the pressure and output drop sharply, they start water injection as a "heart stimulant." This makes oilfield production extremely unstable, and finally, a lot of oil is left underground and cannot be extracted.

Why does this result occur? The reason is that although they know that water injection can maintain pressure, they are very afraid that the injected water will run around underground, causing premature waterflooding of oil wells. So they give up eating because of fear of choking, and dare not boldly inject water. A foreign oilfield development expert once said: "Oil mine workers have a traditional fear of water in oil production." As long as they see the unfavorable aspects, they are scared to death, they avoid the contradiction, and do not actively solve the most fundamental problem. As a result, oilfield development falls into a passive situation and is even destroyed.

What extraction method does Daqing Oilfield adopt? They discarded the foreign oilfield development framework, took "Two Essays" as weapons, and used materialist dialectics to analyze the water injection problem. They recognized that oilfield water injection, like any other thing, has its own duality, with both favorable and unfavorable aspects. The favorable aspect is fundamental, and the unfavorable aspect can be prevented through human effort. Grasping the main contradiction that pressure is the "soul," they carried out a major revolution in the history of oilfield development. Not only did they dare to use the method of early water injection, but they also wanted to develop the oilfield with layered water injection within the oilfield. Water injection begins at the same time as oil extraction. Oil is constantly extracted upwards, and water is constantly injected downwards, so that the oil layer pressure does not drop, and it can spray oil vigorously for a relatively long period of time. After this method was proposed, some people thought that "this is an adventure" and "no one in the world does it this way." However, the broad masses of workers believed that if you want to revolutionize, you must not be afraid of taking risks. To create our own path, we must do what foreigners have not done. They affirmed the favorable aspects of early water injection strategically, dared to struggle, dared to win, and resolutely implemented early water injection. On the other hand, tactically, they attached importance to the unfavorable factors of possible waterflooding. From the beginning of water injection, they actively sought ways to study measures, harness water benefits, and prevent water damage.

The Daqing Oilfield has adopted the extraction method of maintaining pressure. For the past six years of extraction, the pressure of the oil wells has not only not decreased, but the output has been stable, the production capacity has always been strong, and production is very active.

This is how the Daqing people armed their minds with Chairman Mao's philosophical thought in the exploration and development of oilfields. The human factor was brought into play, dialectical materialism defeated metaphysics, and spiritual power transformed into a large oilfield.

    精神是怎样变油田的
    大庆人活学活用毛泽东同志哲学思想的一例
    编者按：毛泽东思想是我国社会主义革命的指针，也是我国社会主义建设的指针。毛泽东思想是我国人民兴无产阶级、灭资产阶级的阶级斗争的指针，也是我国人民向地球开战，进行生产斗争和科学实验的指针。这个论断已经被无数事实所一再证明。《精神是怎样变油田的》这篇通讯所报道的大庆人勘探、开发和建设大油田的生动事迹，又一次作了新的证明。
    今天的中国，学习毛泽东同志的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等哲学著作，学习和掌握唯物辩证法，已经成为广大工人、农民、知识分子的革命要求和共同行动。那里认真活学活用毛泽东思想，那里把毛泽东思想同本地区本部门工作相结合，加以具体化，那里就有自己正确认识事物，分析矛盾，解决问题的活生生的唯物辩证法。哲学再也不是少数人手中的玩艺儿。哲学处在一个空前大解放的历史时代，变成了广大人民人人可学、人人可用的精神武器。大庆油田的建成，既是运用毛泽东同志关于阶级斗争学说的一个胜利，也是运用毛泽东同志哲学思想的一个胜利。
    大庆油田，从不认识到认识，从感性认识到理性认识的整个过程，充满了唯物辩证法对唯心主义、形而上学的斗争。在这场斗争中，大庆人坚持活学活用毛泽东同志哲学思想，终于在认识领域内战胜了一个又一个困难，取得了解放思想的大胜利。学大庆，一定要把这一条学到手，从中汲取精神力量，更自觉地把毛泽东同志的哲学思想紧紧地掌握在自己手里，以便更加顺利地实现从物质到精神、从精神到物质的飞跃，实现从必然王国到自由王国的飞跃，真正做支配自己命运的主人。
    大庆人是怎样运用毛主席的哲学思想指导开发油田的。下边，是一个生动而确凿的例证。
    “懂得了全局性的东西，就更会使用局部性的东西”
    油田油层深埋地下，看不见，摸不着，找油田从哪儿下手呢？
    外国的方法有的是打“野猫子井”，靠“冒碰”，撞运气。还有的是：“溜边转”，找“鸡蛋”，见了油苗就打钻。他们不是从一个地区全面调查入手，去选择最有利的地带，而是一上手就根据个别的少量的资料，局限在一两个局部地点去钻井。这种死蹲在一个地点打转转，只顾局部不顾全局的形而上学的办法，只能推迟发现和拿下油田的时间。
    大庆油田的勘探彻底地打破了洋框框，独创一条中国式的勘探道路。在大量普查勘探工作的基础上，根据毛主席“懂得了全局性的东西，就更会使用局部性的东西”的思想，正确处理局部与全局的关系，进行了全面的周密的调查研究。一开始，就在全部地区用多种方法，进行了综合性的全面调查。经过全面分析研究，逐步地搞清了地下构造的分布情况，明确了含油气的有利地带，发现了储油的构造，使勘探工作作到有分析、有比较、有选择、有的放矢地进行。从而准确地选定了有利地区，确定了主攻方向，部署了钻探力量，较快地发现了大庆油田。
    形而上学的方法是不顾实际地质情况，片面地规定无论在任何地区、任何油田上，都不分阶段地使用少数探井资料，就做出一个构造的全部结论。大庆油田打破了外国的这个“框框”，实行局部和整体相结合的辩证法，结果比他们快得多、省得多，也准得多。“系统地周密地研究周围环境”油田找到了，紧接着的问题是怎么搞清楚这个油田的地下情况。大庆油田职工根据毛主席关于实事求是，调查研究，系统地周密地研究周围环境的教导，大反忽视客观实际、不重视第一性资料的毛病。他们强调要搞清油田情况，必须掌握大量事实，占有大量的资料，进行大量的反复分析。他们提出狠抓第一性资料，为认识油田打下基础。通过群众性讨论，决定从打井到开发的整个过程中，一定要取全取准二十项资料，七十二个数据。
    开始时，有一口井的地质员，在打井过程中，漏取了岩样，没有发现标准层。为了这件事，全油田开了一个星期的会，严肃地进行了教育。油田领导非常重视接受失败的教训。既然花了“学费”，就一定要大家把这个教训记得死死的。搞清地下情况是为了更好地开发油田，这个意义被广大群众掌握以后，全油田开展了热火朝天的大搞第一性资料的群众运动。
    从地下取出岩心来分析化验，是认识油层的一个重要方法。大庆同志们经常用二三四九钻井队方永华班的例子来说明问题。一天，这个班，正在从井下取岩心，因为操作时稍不小心，有一小截掉到井底去了。班长方永华，当时瞅着一小截岩心掉下井底，十分伤心，他抱着岩心筒，一屁股坐在井场上说：“岩心缺一寸，判断地层情况就少了一分科学根据，地质工作上就多了一分困难，掉到井里的岩心取不上来，咱们就欠下了国家一笔债”。
    工人们决心从井底把失落的岩心捞上来。队长劝他们回去休息，他们不回去。指导员把馒头、饺子送到井场，劝他们吃，他们说：“任务完不成，吃饭、睡觉都不香。”他们连续干了二十多个小时，终于把一筒完整的岩心取了出来。
    外国有人断言：“从地下把岩心取上来，一般最多在百分之五十至六十五。”实际上他们一些油田的岩心收获率仅仅只有百分之三十至四十。而大庆油田由于充分调动了人的积极因素，发动了群众，依靠了群众，大力提高了岩心收获率，年年跃进，一些井队已经能够百分之百地从地下把岩心拿上来。“不可知论”的破产
    石油工业部领导上一开始就明确向大庆职工提出：“搞天然油的人，工作岗位在地下，斗争对象是油层”。
    外国有一位地质学家曾提出油层对比的九大困难，他们认为地下情况只能知道个大概，要搞清楚是不可想象的。
    大庆油田的同志们认为，石油的分布都是有规律的。这个规律是可以认识的，关键在于发挥人的因素，用辩证唯物论的方法去进行深入的研究。
    在油层研究过程中，人们对取出的全部岩心，一段不漏地认真观察，反复研究，具体分析每口井的共同点和特殊点，从中找出他们之间的内在联系及其变化规律。经过成千上万次对比分析，终于掌握了油层规律，创造性地发展了地层对比方法。运用这种方法对全油田所有油井的油层资料进行了两千七百多万次地层对比，弄清了各个油层的情况，闯出一条崭新的油层研究道路。
    在大搞油层对比的同时，还进行了大量的分析化验，他们的原则是“宁肯多余，也不少做”。当时的分析化验条件十分困难，没有自来水就安上土水塔挑水坚持搞化验，三年来用扁担挑了十万多担水，分析化验了七万多块样品。
    地质人员和化验人员在井场上盖起土房子，把试验室搬到井场，大搞“三结合”，细心琢磨、研究，并解决了一百零一个可能影响分析精度的问题。过去技术干部觉得在书本上没有的东西就是“难”的，到现场搞了“三结合”，很多过去难的问题，也就变成容易的了。
    铁的事实，彻底粉碎了不可知论。大庆职工从事物的客观存在出发，引出了油田固有的规律，这样就好象在油田地底下走了一遍，哪个油层厚，哪个油层薄，哪个油层力量大，哪个油层力量小，哪个油层连通性好，哪个油层连通性差，都搞得比较清楚。
    “任何矛盾不但应当解决，也是完全可以解决的。”
    石油能从极深的地下喷出来，完全依靠油层的压力；油层一旦失掉压力，油井就会停止自喷，活油田就会变成死油田。
    油不断地从地下采出来，油层压力就会不断下降，就象泄了气的皮球。那么如何保持油层压力呢？经过系统地研究了二十多个国外油田的开发历史，了解到他们一般都是先靠天然能力进行开采，开采一个时期以后，到压力、产量降得很厉害，实在没办法的时候，才开始注水，打“强心针”。这样油田生产极不稳定，最后地下遗留很多油采不出来。
    为什么造成这样结果呢？原因是他们虽然知道注水能保持压力，但十分害怕注进去的水在地下乱窜，形成油井过早水淹，所以因噎废食，不敢大胆注水。一位外国的油田开发专家曾经说：“油矿工作人员采油怕水具有传统性。”他们只要看到不利方面就怕得要死，就回避矛盾，不去积极地解决最根本的问题。结果使油田开发陷入被动局面，甚至遭到破坏。
    大庆油田采取什么方式开采呢？他们甩掉国外油田开发上的框框，以“两论”为武器，运用唯物辩证法分析了注水问题。认识到进行油田注水和任何事物一样，都有着自身的两重性，既有有利方面，也有不利的方面。有利的方面是根本的，不利的方面是可以通过人的努力防止的。抓住压力是“灵魂”这个主要矛盾，进行了一场油田开发史上的大革命。不但敢于用早期注水的方法，而且要在油田内部分层注水进行开发。一开始采油就开始注水，油不断地往上采，水不断地往下注，使油层压力不下降，可以在比较长的时期旺盛喷油。这个方法提出来以后，也有一些人认为“这是冒险”，“世界上没有这样作的”。而广大职工则认为要革命就不能怕担风险，要闯出自己的道路，外国没做到的，我们要做到。他们在战略上肯定了早期注水的有利方面，敢于斗争、敢于胜利，坚决实行早期注水；另一方面，在战术上又重视了可能水淹的不利因素，一开始注水，就积极设法研究措施，发挥水利，防止水害。
    大庆油田采用保持压力的开采方法，现在开采近六年来的油井，压力不但没有下降，而且产量稳定，生产能力始终旺盛，生产十分主动。
    大庆人在勘探、开发油田方面就是这样用毛主席的哲学思想武装了自己的头脑。人的因素发挥出来了，辩证唯物论战胜了形而上学，精神就变成了大油田。
