    Tirana, January 8th, Xinhua News Agency -- The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published a commentary on the 8th, condemning the Johnson administration for playing a malicious "peace negotiation" conspiracy to cover up its plans to expand the war of aggression, and exposing the Khrushchev revisionists for serving US imperialism in order to save it from the failures it faces in Vietnam.

    The commentary pointed out that the Johnson administration's "peace offensive" is a vicious conspiracy aimed at covering up its plans to expand the war and deceiving public opinion at home and abroad. Johnson's "peace" global performance is actually a cover for his preparations to expand the war. Past experience has repeatedly shown that whenever the US government wants to further expand its war of aggression, it talks loudly about so-called "peace."

    The commentary then pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists have long approved of the US "peace talk" conspiracy. The Khrushchev revisionists have always indicated that they are ready to serve US imperialism in order to save them from the inevitable and disgraceful failure they face in Vietnam.

    At the same time, British Prime Minister Wilson unreservedly supports the US aggression against Vietnam. In recent days, he has sent "urgent and strong appeals" to the Soviet leaders regarding "peace initiatives." It is no coincidence that he does so. Under the banner of one of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Wilson believes it is possible to openly drag the Soviet leaders into the dirty collusion of "peace talks." The commentary said that it was precisely under these circumstances that the Khrushchev revisionists sent Shelepin to Hanoi. This visit was announced the day before the United States launched its "peace offensive." All these activities carried out in the name of "peace" by the open or hidden enemies of the Vietnamese people are by no means accidental, but are closely coordinated. Accompanying Johnson's "peace global performance" is the "suspension of bombing of North Vietnam," while preparing to blackmail with "terrible retaliation." And closely accompanying the Khrushchev revisionists' "peace initiatives" on the Vietnam issue is divisive action, while covering it up with the notorious slogan of "joint action" and a slander campaign against China. These two aspects of the activities of US imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists have completely the same purpose, which is to extinguish the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialism and help the US aggressors obtain what they cannot obtain by force.

    The commentary said that the truth about Soviet "aid" to Vietnam is now very clear. The Khrushchev revisionists want to ensure their influence in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, intervene in the Vietnam issue, and bring it into the orbit of Soviet-US cooperation dominating the world.

    The commentary pointed out that Johnson's "peace offensive" and the Khrushchev revisionists' betrayal and divisive activities are a coordinated conspiracy, a reflection of the imperialist and revisionist conspiracy to dominate the world.

    The commentary said that the Soviet Union and the United States frequently conduct contacts and mutual coordination on the Vietnam issue. In this regard, Washington is extremely interested in Shelepin's visit to Hanoi, welcoming him with the continuation of the "suspension of bombing." The importance that the American leaders attach to this visit shows how much hope they have for it. Shelepin's visit to Hanoi, as well as the revisionists' loud cries, seductive propaganda, and so-called "joint action" on the issue of "aid to Vietnam," are not genuine assistance to the heroic Vietnamese people, but are intended to force them to negotiate with the US aggressors.

    The commentary pointed out, however, that the Vietnamese people are determined to carry out the struggle against US armed aggression to the end, and are determined to shatter all enemy conspiracies and tricks. As President Ho Chi Minh rightly pointed out, the Vietnamese people are prepared to fight the US aggressors for ten, twenty, or even longer years until complete victory is achieved. Johnson's "peace" trickery and the vicious conspiracy of imperialism and revisionism to suffocate the Vietnamese people's struggle to defend their homeland will meet with shameful failure, as in the past. The people of all countries in the world, including the Albanian people, firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will win. Imperialist and revisionist conspiracies and deceptions cannot stop the victory of the heroic Vietnamese people, nor can they save the inevitable failure of the imperialist aggressors.

    阿《人民之声报》揭露谢列平访越是为了配合美国“和平攻势”
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者竭力为美帝和谈骗局效劳
    帝国主义和修正主义的阴谋和欺骗都阻挡不了越南人民的胜利
    新华社地拉那八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》八日发表评论，谴责约翰逊政府玩弄“和平谈判”的恶毒阴谋以掩盖其扩大侵略战争的计划，并且揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为美帝国主义效劳，以便把它从在越南面临的失败中挽救出来。
    评论指出，约翰逊政府的“和平攻势”是一个恶毒的阴谋，其目的在于掩盖它扩大战争的计划，欺骗本国和世界公众舆论。约翰逊的“和平”环球表演实际上是掩盖他扩大战争的准备。过去的经验多次表明，每当美国政府想进一步扩大侵略战争的时候，它就大谈所谓“和平”。
    评论接着指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者早就赞成美国“和谈”的阴谋。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一直表明他们随时准备为美帝国主义效劳，以便把他们从越南面临的不可避免的可耻失败中挽救出来。
    和这同时，英国首相威尔逊无保留地支持美国侵略越南，这几天来他向苏联领导人发出了关于“和平倡议”的“紧急和强烈的呼吁”，他这样做不是偶然的。在日内瓦会议两主席之一的招牌下，威尔逊认为有可能公开地把苏联领导人拖入“和谈”的肮脏勾当中去。评论说，正是在这种形势下，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者派出谢列平到河内去。这次访问是在美国发动“和平攻势”的前一天宣布的。越南人民的公开或隐蔽的敌人以“和平”的名义所进行的这一切活动都决不是偶然的，而是互相密切配合的。伴随着约翰逊的“和平环球表演”的是“暂停轰炸越南北方”，同时准备用“可怕的报复”来进行讹诈。而密切伴随着赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在越南问题上的“和平倡议”的则是分裂行动，同时用臭名远扬的“联合行动”的口号和对中国的诽谤运动来加以掩盖。美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的这两方面的活动，目的是完全一样的，这就是扑灭越南人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争，帮助美国侵略者取得用武力所得不到的东西。
    评论说，现在苏联“援助”越南的真相已经十分清楚。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者想确保他们在越南和东南亚的影响，插手越南问题，使之纳入苏美合作主宰世界的轨道。
    评论指出，约翰逊的“和平攻势”和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛和分裂活动是协调一致的阴谋，是帝国主义和修正主义主宰世界的阴谋的反映。
    评论说，苏美在越南问题上经常进行接触和相互协调。在这方面，华盛顿对谢列平访问河内极感兴趣，以继续“暂停轰炸”来欢迎他。美国领导人对这次访问的重视说明，他们对它抱有多么大的希望。谢列平访问河内以及修正主义者在“援越”问题上的大叫大嚷、蛊惑性宣传和所谓“联合行动”，不是对英雄的越南人民的真正援助，而是要迫使他们同美国侵略者进行谈判。
    评论指出，但是，越南人民决心把反对美国武装侵略的斗争进行到底，决心粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计。正如胡志明主席所正确指出的那样，越南人民准备同美国侵略者战斗十年，二十年，甚至更长的时间，直到取得完全胜利。约翰逊的“和平”鬼把戏和帝国主义—修正主义企图窒息越南人民保卫祖国的斗争的恶毒阴谋，将同过去一样遭到可耻的失败。世界各国人民，包括阿尔巴尼亚人民在内，坚信越南人民必胜。帝国主义和修正主义的阴谋和欺骗都阻挡不了英雄的越南人民的胜利，都挽救不了帝国主义侵略者的必然失败。
