    No matter what you are dealing with, always focus on improving ideology
     ——Words of Instructor Zhang Xingcheng
      “If it weren’t for the instructor, I would have really disgraced our working class.” This is what Daqing Oilfield worker Tang Youren often says to people.
    The instructor he refers to is Zhang Xingcheng, a confidant of the masses.
    Tang Youren, this young man, was enthusiastically participating in the construction of oil well insulation houses when suddenly, he received a letter from home. After opening it, he became extremely anxious. He asked the squad leader for leave, but the squad leader told him to discuss it another day. He dropped his pickaxe and went to the team leader, but the team leader said it was the brigade's business and he had no authority. The young man arrived at the brigade headquarters early the next morning. Seeing the brigade leader, he immediately asked to be allowed to go home. The brigade leader asked him what the urgent matter was, but he was too flustered to explain. The brigade leader was an impatient person. Seeing that he couldn't give a clear reason, yet insisted on going home, he got angry. The young man thought he wouldn't be given leave again and also became angry. He thought, whether I get leave or not, I'm leaving, and turned to walk out.
    Zhang Xingcheng, the brigade instructor, a man who was always concerned about the thoughts and lives of the workers, was sitting on a stool at the gatehouse at this moment. He grabbed Tang Youren's collar and said, "As long as you explain the matter clearly, I guarantee the captain will give you leave."
    The young man put the letter on the table and said angrily, "Look at it!"
    Zhang Xingcheng shook his head and said, "I won't read the letter, I believe you, tell me yourself."
    The young man knew that the instructor was most caring and considerate. He calmed down a little and said in one breath: First, his mother was sick and wanted him to go back; second, his mother and his wife were not getting along and he needed to handle it; third, his wife wanted to divorce him and he needed to go back to complete the procedures.
    Hearing this, Zhang Xingcheng felt that the matter was serious and should be resolved quickly. But after opening the letter, his tense heart relaxed. It turned out that the letter paper was only palm-sized. Although it mentioned three things, it was disjointed, full of typos, and the problems were not clearly stated. At the bottom were the words "Mother." Zhang Xingcheng then asked the young man:
  “Does your mother know how to read?”
      “Yes, she learned it during the literacy campaign after liberation.”
    Zhang Xingcheng smiled and said to the young man, "What exactly is your mother's illness? The letter doesn't say. If it is a serious or urgent illness, would she still be able to write you a letter herself? If it is not a serious or urgent illness, what is the use of you rushing back?"
    This was something the young man hadn't thought of. He said, "I don't know!"
      “You don’t know, so why are you so anxious!” Zhang Xingcheng smiled again. "Second, the letter says your mother and your wife are not getting along, what does 'not getting along' mean? I think at most it's just two people arguing. The old people grew up in the old society, and although it's been more than ten years since liberation, they still have some old ideas; while the young people grew up in the new society and can't stand old habits, so sometimes they can't help but argue. My mother and my wife sometimes argue too, but they argue and then it's over. Do you need to go back to handle such things? I think even if you spend all day at home, you'll never be able to handle them all. Are you agree?"
    The young man felt that what the instructor said was indeed reasonable. His mother did have a fiery temper and had argued with his wife in the past, but after it was over, it was over. After the instructor's guidance, the first two points seemed to be relieved, but there was one thing he couldn't shake. He and his wife had always been very good. But why did she want to divorce him?
      “There is also the third thing.” Zhang Xingcheng saw the young man's worry and said further: "The letter says your wife wants to divorce you, but it doesn't say why. Let me ask you first: Did you talk before you got married?"
      “Yes.”
      “Have you argued since you got married?”
    “No.”
    “Then what are you planning to do now?”
      “If she wants a divorce, I won’t back down. I’ll go back and divorce her!”
    “This is strange.” Zhang Xingcheng couldn’t help but smile again: "You talked before you got married, and you've been fine after you got married, so what kind of divorce are you talking about?"
    The young man didn't know how to answer when the instructor asked him this, so he just said, "That's what the letter says."
      “We are the working class, and we must proceed from reality.” Zhang Xingcheng realized that the young man's thinking was too simple and thought he should seize this opportunity to improve him further, so he said: "Whether what the letter says about your wife wanting to divorce you is true or false, we won't worry about it for now. Let me ask you again: You say you won't back down and want to go back and get a divorce, what are your conditions!" Zhang Xingcheng said here, pointing to the brigade leader, squad leader, and several old workers sitting around and saying: "Tell everyone what your conditions are!"
    This really stumped the young man. He thought and thought but couldn't come up with a reason, so he just said three words: "Can't say."
    This made everyone laugh. Even the brigade leader, who had been angry with the young man at first, couldn't help but calm down and laugh along.
      “You need to think calmly.” Zhang Xingcheng continued: "The working class can't do things carelessly. Divorce is a major matter. How can you get a divorce if you can't say what the conditions are? Think about it, when you go back, as soon as you enter the gate, you say to your wife: You want to divorce me, now I'm back, and I want to divorce you too, will that work? Suppose your wife never thought of that, and knows that your mother wrote the letter, will there be good results? First, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was not a big deal in the first place, wouldn't this fundamentally ruin their relationship? Second, your wife has been good to you, wouldn't this make her sad? Suppose your wife really gets angry and goes to court with you, then what will you do! In front of the audience, the judge asks you: Hey, Tang Youren, you want to divorce your wife, please tell us the conditions, what do you say? You say: I can't say! Think about it, what will people say about you! People will definitely say: Tang Youren is from the nationally famous oilfield, where they study Chairman Mao's works every day, but I don't know where his level has gone. Isn't this disgracing our working class?"
    The young man was completely deflated. He hadn't thought that things would develop to such a serious point, and he couldn't help but be surprised himself. He thought, if it weren't for the instructor! He would have really disgraced the working class. So, he asked the instructor for help, he said: "According to what you say, then what should I do!"
    “Aren’t you in a hurry to go home?” Zhang Xingcheng deliberately said to the brigade leader sitting next to him: “Brigade leader, give him leave!”
    The young man took it seriously and became anxious again: "No, no, I can't go back now!"
    Zhang Xingcheng smiled, thinking, such a worker, despite his shortcomings, how pure and lovely his heart is! He told the young man to sit down and asked him to write three letters back home first to understand the situation. The first letter to his mother, asking how her illness was, telling her to take care of herself, and explaining that he was preparing to go back to see her, without mentioning anything else. If there was nothing wrong, she wouldn't mention it in her next letter. The second letter to his wife, not mentioning anything about divorce or mother-in-law/daughter-in-law disagreements, just asking how her life was, and thanking her for taking care of his mother. If there was nothing else, she wouldn't mention it in her reply. The third letter to his best relatives and friends, asking them to understand the family situation. If there was nothing wrong, they wouldn't mention it in their reply either.
    The young man happily returned to the construction site. That night, he quickly sent three letters. More than ten days later, the replies all came, and after opening them, the young man laughed heartily. It turned out that the last letter was written by his mother in a fit of anger. That day, his mother moved house and cleaned up all day. She was very tired and wanted to wait for her daughter-in-law to come back and cook, but she waited and waited, until midnight before she returned. The mother lost her temper; the daughter-in-law couldn't stand it either, because that day the autumn harvest task was very large, and she couldn't spare any time. In the evening, she also had a production team meeting and came back late. Seeing that her mother-in-law was in a bad mood, she retorted a few words. So, the mother wrote that letter to him overnight.
    The young man's understanding improved. He loved, respected, and was grateful to Zhang Xingcheng. From then on, whenever he had the opportunity, he would always say: "If it weren't for the instructor, I would have really disgraced our working class." (Attached picture)

专栏：指导员的故事

    信
    常工
    不论处理什么事情，都要从提高思想着眼
     ——指导员张兴成的话
      “要不是指导员呀，我可真给咱们工人阶级丢了脸。”这是大庆油田工人唐有仁经常向人说的一句话。
    他所说的指导员就是群众的知心人张兴成。
    唐有仁这个小伙子，参加修建油井保温房，正干得很起劲的时候，突然，接到了一封家信，打开一看，急得不得了。他找班长请假，班长叫他改天再谈；他丢下洋镐，又找大队长，大队长说这是中队的事，他没有权力。小伙子第二天一早便赶到了中队部，看见中队长，没说二话，就要求准他回家去。中队长问他有什么急事，他急得说不清。中队长是个急性子，看他说不出一个所以然，而又要坚持回家，便发了火。小伙子以为又不给他假，也发火了，心想，给假也得走，不给假也得走，转过身去，便往外走。
    张兴成，这个中队的指导员，一个无时无刻不在关心工人思想和生活的人，这时正坐在门房的一个凳子上，一把拉住唐有仁的衣襟说：“只要你把事情说清楚，我保证叫队长给你假。”
    小伙子把信往桌上一放，气呼呼地说：“你看吧！”
    张兴成摇摇头说：“信，我不看，我相信你的话，还是你自己说。”
    小伙子知道指导员最能关心人体贴人，冷静了一点，一口气说了下去：第一，母亲有病，要他回去；第二，母亲同他爱人不和，要他处理；第三，他爱人要同他离婚，要他回去办手续。
    乍听这话，张兴成也感到事情严重，应该赶快解决。可是他把信打开一看，一颗紧张的心放下来了。原来信纸只有巴掌大，虽然写的是三件事，但是没头没尾，别字连篇，问题说得都不清楚。下面落着“母亲”二字。张兴成便问小伙子：
  “你母亲认得字吗？”
      “认得，是解放后扫盲时学的。”
    张兴成笑着对小伙子说：“你母亲到底是啥病？信上没有说。如果是重病、急病，她还能亲自给你写信吗？如果不是重病、急病，你急着回去又有什么用？”
    这是小伙子没有想到的事情，他说：“我也不知道啊！”
      “你不知道，怎么那么着急啊！”张兴成又笑了。“第二，信上说你母亲和你爱人不和，什么叫不和呢？我看最多不过是两人吵了嘴。老人们生长在旧社会，尽管解放十多年了，他们还是有些旧脑筋；而年青人都是在新社会长大的，对老习惯看不惯，有时就难免吵上几句。我母亲和我爱人有时也吵嘴，不过，他们吵是吵，过后便没事了。象这样的事情也要你去处理，我看你整天蹲在家里，也永远处理不完的。你说对吗？”
    小伙子觉得指导员的话的确有道理。他的母亲确实是个火性脾气，过去同媳妇就吵过，事情过去了，也就算了。经过指导员的指点，前两点似乎可以放心，可就是有一件放心不下。他同爱人一向是很好的。但是为什么要同自己离婚呢？
      “还有第三件事情。”张兴成看出了小伙子的担心，进一步地说：“信上说你爱人要同你离婚，也没有说原因。我先问问你：你们结婚之前没有谈过吗？”
      “谈过。”
      “结婚以后吵过架吗？”
    “没有。”
    “那你现在打算怎办？”
      “她要离，我不能退让，这就回去和她离吧！”
    “这事可怪了。”张兴成不由得又笑起来：“结婚前谈过，结婚后又不错，那你们要离的是什么婚呀？”
    小伙子被指导员一问，简直不知怎么回答了，只好说：“信上是那样写的”。
      “我们是工人阶级，要从实际情况出发。”张兴成发现小伙子的思想太简单，想着应该抓住这个机会提高一步，就说：“信上说你爱人要同你离婚，是真是假，我们暂时不管。我再问一问你：你说你也不退让，要回去离婚，你的条件是什么呀！”张兴成说到这里，给小伙子指着坐在周围的队长、班长和几个老工人说：“你给大家说说你的条件吧！”
    这下可把小伙子憋坏了，想来想去也想不出个理由来，只好说了三个字：说不上。
    这下把大家都惹笑了。连开始给小伙子发火的队长，也不由得消了气，跟着笑起来。
      “你要冷静地考虑考虑。”张兴成继续说道：“工人阶级办事，不能马马虎虎。离婚是件大事，说不上个条件，那怎么离婚呢？你想想看，你回去了，一进大门，就对爱人说：你要同我离婚，现在我回来了，也要同你离婚，这能行吗？假使你爱人根本没有这样想过，知道是你母亲写信说的，这会有好结果吗？一来，婆媳之间本来没有多大的事情，这下不是要从根本上不和吗？二来，你爱人同你本来不错，这下能使她不伤心吗？假使你爱人真的生了气，同你一块上法庭去，那你又怎么办啊！在旁听的群众面前，法官问你：喂，唐有仁，你要同爱人离婚，请你说说条件吧，你怎么说呀，你说：我说不上！你想想，人们会怎么说你呀！人们一定会这样说：唐有仁是从全国闻名的油田来的，那里天天学习毛主席的著作，就是不知道他的水平跑到那里去了。这不是给咱们工人阶级丢脸吗？”
    小伙子这下全泄气了，没有想到事情竟会发展到如此严重的地步，他自己也不由得吃惊起来。心想，要不是指导员呀！他可真要给工人阶级丢了脸。于是，他向指导员求救了，他说：“照你这么说，那该怎么办呀！”
    “你不是要急着回家吗？”张兴成故意向着坐在旁边的中队长说：“队长，你给他批个假吧！”
    小伙子信以为真，又急了：“不成，不成，现在不能回去呀！”
    张兴成笑了，心想，这样的工人，尽管有缺点，但他的心底多么纯洁，多么可爱啊！他叫小伙子坐下，叫他先写三封信回去，了解一下情况。第一封信给母亲，问问她的病怎样，要她多多保重，并说明自己准备回去看看，其他的事一概不说。如果没有那回事，她再来信就不会提了。第二封信给爱人，什么离婚呀，婆媳不和呀，一概不提，只是问候问候她的生活怎么样，还要感谢感谢她对母亲的照顾，如果没有别的事，她回信也不会提的。第三封信给最好的亲戚朋友，叫他们了解一下家庭情况，如果没有那些事，他们回信更不会提了。
    小伙子高高兴兴地回到工地去了。当天晚上，连忙发了三封信。过了十多天，回信都来了，打开一看，小伙子哈哈大笑。原来，上一次的信是母亲在气头上写的。那天，她母亲搬房子，收拾了一天，很累，想等媳妇回来做饭，可是左等右等，等到半夜才回来，母亲发了脾气；媳妇一见也忍受不了，因为那天秋收任务很大，抽不出空来，到了晚上，又逢生产队开会，回来晚了。看到母亲有脾气，也回顶了几句。于是，母亲连夜给他写了那封信。
    小伙子的认识提高了。对张兴成又热爱，又尊敬，又感激。从这以后，一有机会，总要这么说：“要不是指导员呀，我可真给咱们工人阶级丢了脸。”（附图片）
