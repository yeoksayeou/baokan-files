    Product Design Revolution Must Take Mao Zedong Thought as a Guide
    -- Summary of the Discussion on "Implementing Product Design Revolution to Catch Up with and Surpass Advanced World Levels"
    The People's Daily has invited Comrade Shen Hong, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, to write this article, "Product Design Revolution Must Take Mao Zedong Thought as a Guide," as a summary of the discussion on product design revolution.
                  Editor
    In November 1964, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the call to launch a mass design revolution movement. The vast number of design personnel responded enthusiastically, setting off a high tide of the design revolution movement, which greatly promoted capital construction design work and also promoted the mechanical product design revolution movement, achieving great results.
    In this design revolution movement, the dogmatism and subjectivism in design thought and design methods, as well as the bourgeois individualism of design personnel, have been inspected and criticized in a relatively profound way, improving the ideological awareness and policy level of design personnel. New progress has been made in correcting design thinking, improving design work methods, and eliminating cumbersome philosophies and unreasonable rules and regulations. Design personnel began to go downstairs and out of the hospital, designing a number of advanced new products and reforming a number of old products, laying a solid foundation for further carrying out the mechanical product design revolution movement.
    The product design revolution must take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm design personnel and transform design work. This requires mobilizing the vast number of design personnel to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on studying Chairman Mao's four philosophical essays, learning to use Chairman Mao's thoughts, positions, viewpoints, and methods to handle all problems, working hard on the word "use," liberating themselves from metaphysics and cumbersome philosophy, boldly mobilizing the masses, and pushing the mechanical product design revolution movement to a new high tide.
    The Fundamental Problems of Product Design Revolution
    The main problems to be solved by the mechanical product design revolution movement are:
      (1) Opposing bourgeois ideology and the tendency to take the capitalist road in design work, arming the minds of leading cadres and design personnel with Mao Zedong Thought, so that design personnel can truly design for the revolution, and design work can truly serve the needs of socialist construction, and correctly implement the Party's line, principles, and policies.
      (2) Breaking with book worship, detachment from reality, and detachment from the masses, and establishing a way of thinking that emphasizes practice, links with reality, and links with the masses.
      (3) Breaking with metaphysics and cumbersome philosophy in design methods, organizational division of labor, and rules and regulations, liberating design forces, and establishing scientific design methods, organizational methods, and rules and regulations that meet objective needs.
      (4) Strengthening the leadership core, cultivating and promoting new forces, expanding the design team, and enabling it to move forward by leaps and bounds along the road of being both red and expert.
      (5) Overcoming the conservative thinking of leading cadres who are content with the status quo in the development of product varieties and the bureaucratic style of abandoning leadership over design work. Leading cadres must take the lead in revolution and establish the ambition to actively catch up with and surpass advanced world levels, and truly realize the Party's absolute leadership over design work.
      (6) The product design revolution must be implemented in the design of advanced products, gradually setting off a high tide in the development of new mechanical products, and changing the backward state of products.
    In general, the mechanical product design revolution is to solve the problems of two kinds of thinking, two kinds of methods, and even two roads in design work, and at the same time, to further implement the achievements in ideological and political aspects into scientific and technological work.
    The fundamental problem of the mechanical product design revolution is ideological revolution, and at the same time, carrying out technological revolution and management revolution; it is necessary to build a design team that is both red and expert, develop new products in greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and blaze a path of design work of our own.
    Leading Cadres Must Recognize the Importance of Product Design
    Mechanical product design is the first link in the development of new products, the first process in the production activities of all mechanical factories, and an important chess piece that influences the overall situation of production. The leaders of many units do not have enough understanding of its importance. They are content to be laymen in science and technology, instead of delving into the business and gradually mastering the laws of scientific and technological work to become insiders who lead science and technology. They only grasp the current production and ignore the long-term plan for developing product varieties. They are conservative and lack the ambition to catch up with and surpass advanced world levels. Some products have been produced for eight or ten years, but they never want to move or dare to change. How can they not lag behind? They only assign current tasks to the design department, and as for the thinking, style, methods, organization, etc. in the design work, they hardly care about it. Especially ideological and political work, few people study it or do it. This situation must be changed, and product design work must be put on our important agenda.
    At present, there are tens of thousands of design and research personnel in the country, but the distribution is uneven (they cannot be used in a concentrated manner), and the design departments of some large factories are too finely divided, with too many levels, cumbersome procedures, and low efficiency. Small and medium-sized factories, especially many small factories, do not have design forces and can only rely on other people's drawings. The small number of varieties is a major reason. Things should be viewed from two sides. More people do not necessarily mean more products; fewer people, some also produce products, and people are trained to be more capable. To win big with small, to win strong with weak, not only should there be such strategic thinking in the military, but also in technology. As long as the leadership always considers the human factor first and grasps the living thought first, all difficulties can be overcome. In the long run, we must expand the design team in a planned way; in the current situation, we must first lead this team well and give full play to their role.
    Establish the Ambition to Catch Up with and Surpass Advanced World Levels
    Premier Zhou pointed out in his report at the First Session of the Third National People's Congress that we cannot follow the old road of technological development of other countries and crawl step by step behind others. We must break with conventions, adopt advanced technologies as much as possible, and build our country into a socialist modern power in a not too long historical period.
    The technical level of industrial production in our country is still very backward compared with the advanced world level. At present, the variety of mechanical products that our country can produce is far from meeting the needs of the country or comparing with industrially advanced countries. The quality of most mechanical products that our country has already produced is not high, the structure is relatively backward, the efficiency is low, the precision is poor, the service life is short, the materials used are not fully suitable for our country's resource conditions, and the number of self-designed advanced products is small, far from meeting the requirements of the modernization of the national economy. The labor productivity of some major industries still has a considerable gap compared with the advanced world level.
    To change this backward situation, we must adopt advanced technologies. To have advanced technologies, we need advanced equipment; to have advanced equipment, we first need advanced design. Rapidly increasing the supply of advanced new equipment is the current goal of the machinery manufacturing industry, and our design work must adapt to this requirement.
    Can we catch up with and surpass advanced world levels? Yes! The hardworking and brave 650 million Chinese people, with the leadership of the Communist Party and with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will surely be able to catch up and surpass advanced world levels.
    We must deeply understand Chairman Mao's thought of despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically. We must establish the ambition to catch up with and surpass advanced world levels, but on specific issues, we must deal with them one by one, and catch up and surpass them one by one.
    Catching up with and surpassing advanced world levels should start from the needs of national construction, the country's resource conditions, and the requirements for use. We should distinguish between priorities, urgency, and slowness, and catch up with some and not catch up with others; surpass some and not surpass others. Some should catch up and surpass in variety, and some should catch up and surpass in quality. Large and important products should catch up and surpass, and small, general, large-volume, and ordinary products should also catch up and surpass. The fundamental purpose of catching up and surpassing is to build our country into a modern socialist power. Technology cannot be separated from the economy, technology cannot be separated from the specific environment, we must strictly calculate the economic effect, and implement the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily.
    We must implement the principle of combining originality and learning from foreign countries. Self-reliance is in line with the principle that the internal cause is the basis of change in dialectics, and it is the fundamental policy of our country's construction. We must learn all the good technologies in the world, but we must combine them with our own original spirit. Copied and transferred designs have no vitality. Practice has proved that those who work in accordance with the policy of self-reliance have achieved good or better results, otherwise they have not. Here, we must overcome two kinds of one-sidedness in thinking: one is that we think that we cannot do anything, that everything must be imitated from foreign countries, and that everything must be imported; the other is that when a new product is successfully trial-produced, we think that everything is okay.
    Liberate Thinking, Break Superstitions, Respect Science
    In our design work, there are still superstitions now. What do we have superstitions about? There are mainly four: superstition of "foreign," superstition of "great scholars," superstition of "things," and superstition of "expensive."
    Some people have become prisoners of foreigners in spirit. Anything with the word "foreign" is considered good, while they look down on our own things, thinking they are rustic. This view is completely wrong. Tiananmen has been built for more than 600 years and is still intact. Can foreign countries find a few? Can this be said to be rustic? Humility is good, but excessive humility becomes inferiority. They are superstitious about "foreign," superstitious about foreigners, foreign doctors, foreign masters, and superstitious about so-called "great scholars." They do not believe in the workers and peasants. One factory designed a water-spray cooled screw compressor by themselves, and always thought it was unreliable. Recently, someone went abroad for a visit and saw that others also used water-spray cooling, and then they were relieved. This is how they are superstitious about "foreign."
    Superstition of "things," one-sided emphasis on the material and technical foundation, and disbelief in the human factor. Beijing Switch Factory is doing well. They were not restricted by the poor material and technical foundation, and they only used eighteen yuan to trial-produce the printed circuit of the computer.
    Superstition of "expensive," thinking that expensive is always better than cheap, complicated is always better than simple, and so on.
    Design is creative labor, and there must be some romanticism. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do, can we design good things. In our current situation, selecting models is still necessary, but where to select models for truly new creations? The Second Ministry of Light Industry has many things that were created under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, daring to think and dare to do. There was originally nothing, so there was nowhere to select models. Didn't the pig slaughtering workers of Tianjin Food Factory No. 2 also design and manufacture pig slaughtering and hair removal machines! And the efficiency is very high, capable of removing hair from 600 pigs per hour. Where are there pig slaughtering machinery departments in universities? If design work is to be done by college students, where are there so many college students? As long as we liberate our thinking and break with superstitions, there will be many people who can do design. Middle school students and workers can all do design.
    We must liberate our thinking and break with superstitions. If we do not liberate ourselves from superstitions, it is impossible to correctly understand things, and we will not have a correct view of things.
    If we break the superstition of "foreign," we will dare to design ourselves.
    If we break the superstition of "great scholars," we will have countless design personnel.
    If we break the superstition of "things," we can achieve results by making the best of simple conditions.
    If we break the superstition of "expensive," we will have an economic point of view and can have products with good quality and low prices.
    We must respect science. Marxism-Leninism is science, Mao Zedong Thought is science, and dialectical materialism is science. Using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide design work will inevitably follow the mass line, inevitably recognize that the human factor is first, and inevitably combine theory and practice. These are the first-rate sciences. Natural science must be mastered by people with correct thinking in order to best play its role. Designers must have the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and must have the two-point theory.
    Give Full Play to the Initiative of Design Personnel
    After more than ten years of development, we now have a group of design personnel who are both red and expert, and their ideological position and ideological methods are correct or relatively correct. However, there are still a considerable number of people who have all kinds of ideological problems, such as: detachment from politics, contention for fame and profit, lack of cooperation, willingness to be the protagonist, unwillingness to be the supporting role; arrogance and complacency, self-righteousness; detachment from reality, detachment from the masses; lack of ambition, conservatism, fear of revolution, unwillingness to be responsible. Their minds still have metaphysical ways of thinking, looking at things from an isolated, static, and one-sided point of view, and so on.
    Intellectuals whose thinking has already made progress should not be complacent because of this, but should further combine with the workers and peasants and continue to transform themselves in the practice of design work. For those who still have incorrect views in their thinking, we should help them transform their negative factors into positive factors as much as possible and serve the great cause of socialist construction. This is the work of transforming people's thinking, and it is an arduous task.
    For intellectuals whose ideological understanding has some problems, as long as they truly want to serve the cause of socialism, we should first trust them, give play to their talents, and help them gradually transform their world outlook. For those design personnel who have problems in their thinking, history, and social relations, we should act in accordance with the Party's policy of "emphasizing performance." We should pay attention to the old experts, but they are, after all, a minority, and more importantly, we should cultivate and promote young technicians. Especially those who are good politically, have achievements in their specialties, and have the potential for development should be given more attention. We have been doing this for sixteen years. How can we not cultivate a group of young experts? Promoting young people from worker backgrounds and college graduates is a major issue in cultivating successors.
    We should also pay attention to reducing the administrative work of experts and allow them to spend 70% to 80% of their time engaged in professional activities. We should also give them some time to study and research Chairman Mao's works so that they can become design personnel who are both red and expert.
    In design work, we should implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom, and promote technical democracy. We should fully discuss various technical issues and give play to everyone's wisdom. With democracy, there must be centralization, and the scattered wisdom of the masses must be concentrated into collective wisdom and applied to design. This requires the establishment of a responsibility system. The responsibility system is a system in which a specific design is designated to be responsible by a certain executor. He has full power to handle all technical issues within the scope of this design, ensuring that he has responsibility and power. In this way, design personnel can wholeheartedly, thoughtfully, and in every possible way strive to solve problems in design work, and can truly create high-quality results. Of course, to implement the responsibility system, design personnel must have a high sense of responsibility and must have unlimited loyalty to the cause of socialist construction.
    Design is a creative work, and there will be success and failure. Failure is not terrible, what is terrible is not to analyze and study the causes of the error. Without failure, there is no success, and failure is the mother of success. Drawing lessons from failures can be transformed into success, and if those who succeed become arrogant and complacent, they will inevitably lead to failure. People's understanding of objective things always has a process. If the design fails, the leadership should take the initiative to bear the responsibility that the leader should bear, and actively help the design personnel summarize experience and correct errors.
    The human factor comes first. We must apply the People's Liberation Army's "Four Firsts" and "Three-Eight Style" to design work, fully mobilize the initiative of the vast number of design personnel, and create a lively and vigorous political situation with both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and a happy mood. Implement the mass line and implement "three combinations."
    Practice has proved that the "three combinations" of workers, technicians, and leading cadres is an important method for implementing the mass line in design work. Using the "three combinations" method for design can improve quality, shorten the cycle; at the same time, it can also educate design personnel on how to follow the mass line, and it is also a method to overcome individualism, book worship, detachment from politics, detachment from the masses, and detachment from reality. True "three combinations" is a manifestation of high trust in the masses and a manifestation of high responsibility.
    As Comrade Mao Zedong said in the preface to "Rural Survey": "It must be understood that the masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous. Without understanding this, we cannot get the most basic knowledge." If we let people with individualistic thinking go to "three combinations," or let people who are influenced by foreign frameworks and have the viewpoint of "defending design" go to "three combinations," or let people who are careless and do not seek thorough understanding go to "three combinations," they will not achieve the goal. This is the reason why the "three combinations" have also failed in the past few years. Constantly carrying out the practice of correct "three combinations" may change these people's incorrect thinking.
    Promote the "Seven Things Consistent System" and "Four to the Site"
    A considerable part of our design and research personnel have long held on to books, believed in books, and been detached from the masses and reality. Since the winter of 1964, the style has changed greatly. Many people have gone downstairs and out of the hospital, and seen a new world. They have begun to face the masses and face reality, achieving great results. Some units have tried the "Seven Things Consistent System" (that is, with design personnel as the main body, connecting the seven things of research, experiment, design, creation, inspection, installation, and use), which not only correctly handled the relationship between theory and practice, but also solved the problem of excessive division of labor and mutual buck-passing, enabling design personnel to expand the scope of contact and understand the entire process of a machine product from conception to use, which not only improved work efficiency, but more importantly, rapidly cultivated design forces.
    Design, to put it simply, is thinking of ways. Design personnel are personnel who think of ways. Who can think of ways? Only those who are in contact with reality every day are the most capable of thinking of ways. Zhang Denghe of Tianjin Food Factory No. 2 wrote in "We Pig Slaughtering Workers Created New Machines": "Although we do not have the technology to manufacture machines, we are the most experienced in pig slaughtering. Therefore, on this issue, we are the smartest, we have the most say, and we are qualified to create hair removal machines." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If you want to have knowledge, you have to participate in the practice of transforming reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you have to transform the pear and taste it yourself." Countless examples prove that design personnel who are detached from reality and detached from the masses cannot design high-quality products.
    The "Seven Things Consistent System" is the experience summarized by Jiangnan Shipyard in designing and manufacturing the 10,000-ton water press. In the trial implementation by various units, some have combined production and technology to implement the "Seven Things Consistent System" for production technology work; some have only combined technology and not production to implement the "Seven Things Consistent System" for technology work; some have still separated design and technology to implement the "Seven Things Consistent System" for design work, and have achieved certain results.
    Recently, Shanghai, in accordance with the spirit of the "Seven Things Consistent System," has implemented the "Four to the Site" design method, that is, go to the "use site" to investigate and study and propose plans; go to the "test site" to repeatedly test and determine the design; go to the "manufacturing site" to provide labor services and solve key problems; go to the "installation and use site" to install and test the car and summarize and improve. The basic spirit of this design method has universal significance.
    What is the basic spirit of the "Seven Things Consistent System" and "Four to the Site"? It is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide design work, so that theory and practice are closely combined, opposing idealism and book worship; closely combining division of labor and integration, opposing metaphysical mechanical division of labor; closely combining design personnel and worker masses, responsible to the end, and ensuring that the product is easy to use, easy to manufacture, easy to install, easy to repair, and good-looking, and also saves labor, saves materials, and saves money.
    Both High, Large, Sophisticated, and Advanced and Light, Small, Simple, and Economical
    The design pass is really important. If the design is good, it can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. If the design is not good, it will become less, slower, worse, and more expensive. To design well, we cannot rely on subjective wishes, but must recognize and use the objective laws of technological and economic development. First of all, we must use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to analyze things. Good and bad, advanced and backward are relative and conditional, and should not be absolutized. They should be adapted to local conditions and adapted to the times. High, large, sophisticated, and advanced products are what the machinery industry must focus on developing, but light, small, simple, and economical products with universal economic significance cannot be ignored. The host is important, and the auxiliary machine cannot be considered secondary, otherwise it will be difficult to complete the set. Attachments and tool fixtures on machine tools seem to be small things, but mechanical processing cannot do without them. The development of high, large, sophisticated, and advanced products in the machinery industry is only one aspect, and it is a technically difficult aspect. And light, small, simple, and economical products that are technically easier, more widely used, larger in quantity, and more economically significant are also worth paying attention to. High, large, sophisticated, and advanced and light, small, simple, and economical should be developed in parallel. What is said above is only in terms of variety. To fully realize greater, faster, better, and more economical results in design, we must also consider our country's resource conditions, use technology, and so on. Reform the Rules and Regulations of Design Work Many people working together have production relations problems and need rules and systems to coordinate each other's work. The rules and systems should be simple, clear, and practical, but at present, many enterprises still have the big problem of excessive division of labor, too many levels, cumbersome procedures, and slow handling. This is a manifestation of the prevalence of cumbersome philosophy. These rules and systems are formulated by the factories themselves, stipulated by the higher authorities, and proposed by the various user departments. Revolution requires joint efforts from top to bottom, inside and outside, to make it good.
    The rules and systems should change with time, place, and conditions, but some people stubbornly stick to the old rules, and the more they manage, the more rigid they become. This must be reformed. Of course, the reform of rules and systems must be realistic, specific analysis, and not be denied in general. We must establish first and then break, and have both establishment and breaking.
    Realize Standardization, Serialization, and Generalization
    The "threeizations" (standardization, serialization, and generalization) work is a major event related to the production technology and economic activities of various departments of the national economy. It is very important for all departments, and especially important for the machinery industry department. If the "threeizations" work is done well, it can promote the improvement of product quality, increase output, reduce costs, greatly accelerate the development of varieties, ensure the interchangeability of parts, strengthen the collaboration and coordination between various departments and enterprises, simplify industrial and enterprise management, and better utilize the country's resource conditions, and so on.
    Our country's "threeizations" work is still in the entrepreneurial stage. In the future, we must take the road of self-design. An important sign of self-design is to establish standards and product series that are in line with our country's conditions. This is a very important task, not only a technical task, but also a policy-oriented political, technical, and economic combination. Leaders at all levels should put the "threeizations" work on the agenda and seriously grasp it. We must mobilize design institutions at all levels and all design personnel to engage in "threeizations," especially serialization and generalization. "Threeizations" is an important part of the creative design process, and design personnel must learn to master the knowledge and methods of "threeizations" and consciously apply them in their work. We must overcome metaphysics and recognize that whether it is a standard or a series, although it has a unified and stable side, it will change with time and place, and it needs to be constantly metabolized to adapt to the needs of development. Unity and stability are relative, and we must unify without dying and live without chaos, and we cannot absolutize it.
    Carry Out Technical Intelligence and Publishing Work
    To do a good design, in addition to having correct design thinking and necessary theoretical knowledge, we mainly rely on the practical experience of production and science. Direct practical experience is of course the most valuable, but it is limited for an individual or a unit. Therefore, in addition to participating in practice and creation themselves, designers should also pay attention to collecting technical intelligence data at home and abroad, fully use the achievements that others have already made, or learn from the practical experience of others, in order to draw inferences from one instance and accelerate the progress of work.
    The dissemination of knowledge mainly relies on books. We oppose book worship, but we advocate publishing more good books and reading some good books seriously. Technical books are one of the important ways to spread technical knowledge, and our country's mechanical technical science books and periodicals currently cannot meet the needs of development. Generally speaking, it is "three few and three many": the number of publications is not small, but there are not many suitable ones; there are few self-compiled ones and many translated ones; there are few high-quality ones and many duplicates. Especially elementary and intermediate popular readers are even fewer. Therefore, we must vigorously carry out technical intelligence and publishing work.
    Establish a National Mechanical Product Design and Research Network
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: To organize the strength of the masses is a policy. The revolutionization of the design work of various systems, enterprises, and units will certainly produce material strength, but it is still a scattered force. We must further gather it together within the country to become a huge force.
    At present, it is necessary to form a mechanical product design and research network nationwide, including product design and research forces in various industries, including user departments. All factories, regardless of size, should have their own design institutions. Within the same industry, professional groups can be formed, with members inside and outside the group communicating with each other and holding annual meetings regularly to exchange experience, summarize experience, cooperate with each other, and improve together.
                      ×　×　×
    At present, the level of mechanical product designers in our country is not high, but after this revolutionary movement, we will gradually learn to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, gradually establish the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly, and in a few years, we will inevitably become a strong design team that is both red and expert, and become a powerful technical force for our country to catch up with and surpass advanced world levels. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish lofty ambitions, set great aspirations, work hard, and forge ahead bravely.

    产品设计革命必须以毛泽东思想为指针
    ——关于“实行产品设计革命，赶上和超过世界先进水平”讨论的总结
    本报约请第一机械工业部副部长沈鸿同志撰写《产品设计革命必须以毛泽东思想为指针》这篇文章，作为关于产品设计革命讨论的一个总结。
                  编者
    一九六四年十一月，毛泽东同志发出开展群众性设计革命运动的号召，广大设计人员热烈响应，掀起了设计革命运动的高潮，极大地推动了基本建设设计工作，也促进了机械产品设计革命运动，取得了很大的成绩。
    在这次设计革命运动中，对于设计思想、设计方法上的教条主义、主观主义，以及设计人员中的资产阶级个人主义思想，都进行了比较深刻的检查和批判，提高了设计人员的思想觉悟和政策水平；在端正设计思想、改进设计工作方法、破除烦琐哲学和不合理的规章制度等方面，都有了新的进展。设计人员开始下楼出院，设计出了一批先进的新产品，改革了一批老产品，为进一步开展机械产品设计革命运动打下了有力的基础。
    产品设计革命必须以毛泽东思想为指针，用毛泽东思想来武装设计人员，改造设计工作。这就要发动广大设计人员活学活用毛主席著作，特别是要着重学习毛主席的四篇哲学论文，学会用毛主席的思想、立场、观点和方法来处理一切问题，在用字上下苦功夫，从形而上学、烦琐哲学中解放出来，放手发动群众，把机械产品设计革命运动推向新的高潮。
    产品设计革命的根本问题
    机械产品设计革命运动要解决的主要问题是：
      （一）反对设计工作中的资产阶级思想和走资本主义道路的倾向，用毛泽东思想武装领导干部和设计人员的头脑，使设计人员真正作到为革命而设计，设计工作真正为社会主义建设的需要服务，正确地贯彻党的路线、方针和政策。
      （二）破本本主义、脱离实际、脱离群众的思想作风，树立重视实践、联系实际、联系群众的思想作风。
      （三）破设计方法、组织分工和规章制度上的形而上学、烦琐哲学，解放设计力量，建立科学的符合客观需要的设计方法、组织方法和规章制度。
      （四）健全领导核心，培养和提拔新生力量，壮大设计队伍，使之沿着又红又专的道路大步前进。
      （五）克服领导干部在发展品种工作上安于现状的保守思想和对设计工作放弃领导的官僚主义。领导干部要带头革命和树立积极赶超世界先进水平的雄心壮志，真正实现党对设计工作的绝对领导。
      （六）产品设计革命要落实到先进产品的设计工作上面，逐步掀起一个发展新型机械产品的高潮，改变产品落后的状况。
    总起来说，机械产品设计革命是要在设计工作上解决两种思想、两种方法、以至两条道路的问题，同时要进一步把思想政治方面的成果，落实到科学技术工作上去。
    机械产品设计革命的根本问题是思想革命，同时，进行技术革命和管理革命；要建立一支又红又专的设计队伍，多快好省地发展新产品，走出一条我国自己的设计工作的道路来。
    领导干部必须认识产品设计的重要性
    机械产品设计，是发展新产品的第一个环节，是所有机械工厂生产活动的第一道工序，是左右生产全局的一只重要棋子。许多单位的领导对它的重要性的认识是不够的，他们安于当科学技术的外行，而不是深入到业务中去，逐步掌握科学技术工作的规律，成为领导科学技术的内行。他们只抓当前的生产，忽视发展产品品种的长远计划，因循守旧，没有赶上和超过世界先进水平的雄心壮志；有些生产了十年八年的产品，老是不想动、不敢改，怎能不落后？他们只是向设计部门布置当前的任务，至于设计工作中的思想、作风、方法、组织，等等，几乎是不管的，特别是思想政治工作，更是很少有人去研究、去做。这种状况必须改变，必须把产品设计工作摆到我们重要的议事日程上来。
    目前，全国设计与研究人员有好几万人，但是，分布不平衡（不能集中使用），部分大工厂设计部门分工太细，层次太多，手续繁，效率低。中、小型工厂，特别是许多小厂没有设计力量，只能依靠别人的图纸。品种之所以少，这是个大原因。事情应当一分为二来看，人多了，不一定能多出产品；人少了，有的也出了产品，人也锻炼得更精干了。以小胜大，以弱胜强，不仅在军事上要有这样的战略思想，在技术上也应当如此。只要领导上时时考虑人的因素第一，抓活思想第一，一切困难都是可以克服的。从长远来说，我们必须有计划地扩大设计队伍；从当前来说，必须首先领导好这支队伍，充分发挥他们的作用。
    树立赶上和超过世界先进水平的雄心壮志
    周总理在第三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的报告中指出，我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。
    我国工业生产的技术水平，跟世界先进水平比较，还是很落后的。目前，我国能够生产的机械产品品种，无论是跟国家的需要相比，还是跟工业先进国家相比，都差得远。我国已经生产的大多数机械产品的质量还不高，结构比较落后，效率低，精度差，寿命短，所用材料也不完全适合我国的资源情况，自行设计的先进产品为数不多，远远满足不了国民经济现代化的要求。一些主要行业的劳动生产率，跟世界先进水平比较，还有相当大的差距。
    要改变这种落后状况，必须采用先进技术。要有先进的技术，就需要有先进的设备；要有先进的设备，首先需要先进的设计。迅速地增加先进的新设备的供应，是当前机械制造业的奋斗目标，我们的设计工作要适应这一要求。
    我们要赶上和超过世界先进水平，能不能呢？能！勤劳勇敢的六亿五千万中国人民，有共产党的领导，有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，一定能够后来居上，赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    我们必须深刻理解毛主席的在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难的思想。要立下赶上和超过世界先进水平的雄心壮志，但是，在具体问题上，要一个一个来处理，一个一个来赶和超。
    赶上和超过世界先进水平，要从国家建设需要、国家资源情况和使用要求出发。应当分清先后缓急，有所赶，有所不赶；有所超，有所不超。有的要在品种上赶超，有的要在质量上赶超。大的、重要的产品要赶超，小的、一般的、大量的、普通的产品也要赶超。赶超的根本目的是要把我国建设成为现代化的社会主义强国。技术不能离开经济，技术不能离开具体的环境，要严格地计算经济效果，贯彻勤俭建国的精神。
    必须贯彻独创和学习外国相结合的原则。自力更生是符合辩证法的内因是变化的根据这一原理的，是我们国家建设的根本方针。世界上一切好的技术，我们都要学习，但是必须同我们的独创精神相结合。照抄照转的设计是没有生命力的。实践证明，凡是按照自力更生这一方针进行工作的，都得到好的或较好的结果，反之则否。这里，在思想上要克服两种片面性：一种是认为自己什么都不行，什么都要仿造外国的，什么都要进口；另一种是，新产品试制成功，就认为什么都行了。
    解放思想，破除迷信，尊重科学
    在我们的设计工作中，现在还有迷信。迷信什么呢？主要有四个：迷信“洋”，迷信“大学问人”，迷信“物”，迷信“贵”。
    有些人在精神上作了洋人的俘虏，凡是带“洋”字的东西，都认为是好的，对我们自己的东西则看不上眼，认为是土里土气，土头土脑。这种看法十分错误。天安门已经建造了六百多年，现在仍然完好无恙，外国能找得出几个？这能说它是土头土脑吗？虚心是好的，虚心过了头就变成自卑了。他们迷信“洋”，迷信洋人、洋博士、洋硕士，迷信所谓“大学问人”，他们不相信工农群众。有一个工厂自己设计了一种喷水冷却的螺杆压缩机，总认为不可靠。最近有人出国访问，一看人家也有用喷水冷却的，这才放心了。他们就是这样迷信“洋”。
    迷信“物”，片面强调物质技术基础，而不相信人的因素。北京开关厂做得好，他们没有被物质技术基础差束缚住，只用十八元就试制出了计算机的印刷线路。
    迷信“贵”，认为贵的总比便宜的好，复杂的总比简单的好，等等。
    设计是创造性劳动，要有点浪漫主义。在毛泽东思想指导下，有敢想敢干的革命精神，才能设计出好的东西来。在我们今天的情况下，先选型还是需要的，但是，真正新的创造到哪里去选型呢？第二轻工业部有很多东西，都是在毛泽东思想指导下，敢想敢干创造出来的，原来就没有，无从选型。天津食品二厂杀猪工人不是也设计制造出了杀猪退毛机吗！而且效率很高，每小时能退六百头猪，大学校里哪里有杀猪机械系呢？设计工作都要大学生去做，哪有那么多大学生？只要解放思想，破除迷信，能搞设计的人就很多，中学生、工人都可以搞设计。
    我们要解放思想，破除迷信。如不从迷信中解放出来，就不可能正确地认识事物，对事物就不会有正确的看法。
    破除了“洋”的迷信，我们就敢自己设计了。
    破除了“大学问人”的迷信，我们就有无数设计人员了。
    破除了“物”的迷信，我们就可以因陋就简搞出成绩来了。
    破除了“贵”的迷信，我们就有了经济观点，就能有物美价廉的产品。
    要尊重科学，马克思列宁主义是科学，毛泽东思想是科学，唯物辩证法是科学。以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来指导设计工作，就必然会走群众路线，必然会认识到人的因素第一，必然会理论与实践相结合。这些是第一位的科学。自然科学，要由有正确思想的人去掌握它，才能最好地发挥它的作用。设计工作者要有辩证唯物论的观点，要有两点论。
    充分发挥设计人员的积极性
    经过十几年的发展，我们现在已经有了一批又红又专的设计人员，他们的思想立场和思想方法是正确的，或者是比较正确的。但是，也还有相当一部分人，有形形色色的思想问题，例如：脱离政治，争名夺利，互不合作，愿当主角，不愿当配角；骄傲自满，自以为是；脱离实际，脱离群众；缺乏雄心壮志，因循守旧，不敢革命，不愿负责。他们的头脑中还存在着形而上学的思想方法，用孤立的、静止的和片面的观点去看待事物，等等。
    思想已经有了进步的知识分子，不应当因此自满，还要进一步同工农结合，继续在设计工作的实践中改造自己。对思想上还存在不正确观点的人，应当帮助他们尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为社会主义建设这个伟大事业服务。这是改造人的思想的工作，这是一项艰巨的任务。
    对思想认识多少有些问题的知识分子，只要他真正愿意为社会主义事业服务，我们首先应当信任他们，发挥他们的才能，并且帮助他们逐步改造世界观。对于那些思想上、历史上、社会关系上有问题的设计人员，应当按照党的“重在表现”的政策办事。要重视老专家，但他们毕竟是少数，更重要的是培养和提拔青年技术人员。特别是对政治上好、专业上有成就、有发展前途的，更要重视。我们搞了十六年了，不培养一批青年专家怎么行呢？提拔工人出身、大专学校毕业的青年，这是一个培养接班人的重大问题。
    还要注意减少专家的行政事务工作，要让他们有百分之七十到八十的时间从事专业活动，还要给他们一些时间学习和研究毛主席著作，使他们成为又红又专的设计人员。
    在设计工作中，要贯彻百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针，发扬技术民主。对技术上的各种问题，应当充分展开讨论，发挥大家的智慧。有民主就必须有集中，把分散的群众的智慧集中起来成为集体的智慧，运用到设计中去，这就要建立责任制。责任制是对某一具体设计指定由某一执行人负责的制度，对这一设计范围内的一切技术问题，由他全权处理，保证他有责有权。这样才能够使设计人员全心全意地、深思熟虑地、千方百计地努力来解决设计工作中的问题，才能真正创造出高质量的成果来。当然，实行责任制，设计人员必须有高度的责任感，要有对社会主义建设事业的无限忠诚。
    设计是一项创造性的工作，有成功，也会有失败。失败并不可怕，可怕的倒是不去分析研究造成错误的原因。没有失败就没有成功，失败是成功之母。在失败中吸取教训，就能够转化为成功，而成功了的如果骄傲自大，又必然会走向失败。人对客观事物的认识总是要有一个过程的，设计失败了，领导上要主动承担领导者应负的责任，积极帮助设计人员总结经验，改正错误。
    人的因素第一，必须把解放军的“四个第一”、“三八作风”运用到设计工作中来，充分调动广大设计人员的积极性，造成一种既有集中，又有民主，既有纪律，又有自由，既有统一意志，又有心情舒畅，生动活泼的政治局面。贯彻群众路线，实行“三结合”
    实践证明，工人群众、技术人员和领导干部的“三结合”，是设计工作中贯彻群众路线的重要方法。用“三结合”的方法进行设计，质量可以提高，周期可以缩短；同时，还可以教育设计人员怎样走群众路线，也是克服个人主义、本本主义、脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的一种方法。真正的“三结合”，是高度信任群众的表现，也是高度负责的表现。
    正如毛泽东同志在《农村调查》序言中所说的：“必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”如果让抱有个人主义思想的人去“三结合”，或者让受洋框框影响带着“辩护设计”观点的人去“三结合”，或者让粗枝大叶、不求甚解的人去“三结合”，都是达不到目的的，这是几年来的“三结合”也有过失败的原因。不断地进行正确的“三结合”的实践，可能改变这些人的不正确的思想。
    推广“七事一贯制”和“四个到现场”
    我们相当大一部分设计研究人员，长期以来抱住本本，迷信本本，脱离群众，脱离实际。从一九六四年冬天开始，作风大变，许多人下楼出院，见到新的天地了，开始面向群众，面向实际了，取得了很大的成效。有的单位试行“七事一贯制”（即以设计人员为主，把研究、试验、设计、创造、检验、安装和使用七件事贯连起来），不仅正确处理了理论与实践的关系，也解决了分工过细而互相扯皮的问题，使设计人员扩大了接触范围，认识了一台或一套机械产品从设想到使用的全部过程，不仅提高了工作效率，更重要的是迅速地培养了设计力量。
    设计，通俗地说就是想办法。设计人员就是想办法的人员。谁能想办法？只有天天接触实际的人，才是最会想办法的人。天津食品二厂张登和同志写的《我们几个宰猪工人创造了新机器》一文中说：“我们虽然没有制造机器的技术，但是对宰猪来说，我们是最有实践经验的。因此在这个问题上，我们最聪明，我们最有发言权，我们有资格创造退毛机。”毛泽东同志说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”无数的事例证明，脱离实际，脱离群众的设计人员，是不可能设计出高质量的产品来的。
      “七事一贯制”是江南造船厂在设计制造万吨水压机时总结出来的经验。各单位在试行中，有的把生产和技术统起来，实行生产技术工作的“七事一贯制”；有的只统技术不统生产，实行技术工作的“七事一贯制”；有的设计和工艺仍旧分开，实行设计工作的“七事一贯制”，都取得了一定的效果。
    最近，上海根据“七事一贯制”的精神，实行了“四个到现场”的设计方法，即到“使用现场”调查研究、提出方案；到“试验现场”反复试验、确定设计；到“制造现场”劳动服务、解决关键；到“安装使用现场”安装试车、总结提高。这种设计方法的基本精神具有普遍意义。
      “七事一贯制”和“四个到现场”的基本精神是什么呢？就是用毛泽东思想来指导设计工作，使理论和实践密切结合起来，反对唯心主义、本本主义；把分工和综合密切结合起来，反对形而上学的机械分工；把设计人员和工人群众密切结合起来，一竿子负责到底，保证产品好用、好造、好装、好修、好看，还要省工、省料、省钱。
    高大精尖与轻小简廉并举
    设计这一关，关系真大。设计得好，就能达到多快好省，设计得不好，就会变为少慢差费。要想设计得好，不能凭主观的愿望，而是要认识和运用技术经济发展的客观规律。首先要用辩证唯物论、历史唯物论的观点来分析事物。好与坏、先进与落后，都是相对的，有条件的，不要绝对化，要因地制宜，因时制宜。高大精尖产品，是机械工业必须着重发展的，但带有普遍经济意义的轻小简廉产品，也不能不顾。主机重要，辅机也不能认为是次要的，不然就难以成套。机床上的附件、工具夹具看来都是小东西，可是机械加工离不了它。机械工业发展高大精尖产品，还只是一个方面，是技术上较难的方面。而技术较易、使用面更广、数量更大、经济意义更显著的轻小简廉产品，也是值得注意发展的一个方面。应当高大精尖与轻小简廉并举。上面所讲的只是就品种这个方面来说的，要在设计上全面实现多快好省，还必须考虑我国的资源条件、使用技术等等。改革设计工作的规章制度许多人在一起共同劳动，就有生产关系问题，就需要有协调彼此工作的规章和制度。规章制度应当是简单明了、切实可行的，可是目前许多企业还存在着分工太细、层次太多、手续烦琐、办事迟缓的大毛病。这是烦琐哲学盛行的表现。这些规章制度，有工厂自己制定的，有上级规定的，也有各用货部门提出的，要革命就需要上下、内外一起动手，才能革好。
    规章制度应当随时间地点条件而变，有些人却死守陈规，愈管愈死，这是必须改革的。当然，改革规章制度要实事求是，要具体分析，不要一概否定，要先立后破，有立有破。
    实现标准化、系列化、通用化
    “三化”（标准化、系列化、通用化）工作，是关系到国民经济各部门生产技术和经济活动的一件大事。它对于各部门都很重要，对机械工业部门，尤其重要。“三化”工作搞好了，可以促进产品质量的提高，可以增加产量，降低成本，可以大大加速品种的发展，可以保证零部件的互换，加强各部门、各企业之间的协作和协调，可以简化工业和企业的管理，可以更好地利用国家的资源条件，等等。
    我国的“三化”工作尚在创业阶段。今后我们要走自行设计的道路，自行设计有一个重要的标志，就是建立切合我国情况的标准和产品系列。这是十分重要的一项工作，不仅是一项技术工作，而且是一项政策性很强的政治、技术、经济紧密结合的工作。各级领导应当把“三化”工作提到议事日程上来，认真地抓起来。要发动各级设计机构和全体设计人员搞“三化”，特别是系列化和通用化。“三化”是创造性的设计过程中的重要组成部分，设计人员必须学习掌握“三化”的知识和方法，在自己的工作中经常地、自觉地加以运用。要克服形而上学，要认识无论是标准或系列，虽有统一、稳定的一面，但都将随着时间、地点而改变，需要不断地新陈代谢以适应发展的需要。统一和稳定都是相对的，要统而不死，活而不乱，不能绝对化。
    开展技术情报和出版工作
    要做好一个设计，除了要有正确的设计思想和必要的理论知识以外，主要依靠生产和科学的实践经验。直接的实践经验当然最为宝贵，但是，它对一个人、一个单位来说毕竟是有限的。因此，设计者除了自己参加实践创造以外，还要重视搜集国内外的技术情报资料，充分运用别人已经取得的成果，或者从别人的实践经验中得到教益，以举一反三，加快工作的进展。
    知识的传播主要靠书本，我们反对本本主义，但是，我们提倡多出些好书，认真读些好书。技术书籍是传播技术知识的重要途径之一，而我国机械技术科学书籍和刊物，目前远远不能满足发展的需要。概括说来是“三少三多”：出版的数量不少，合用的不多；自编的少，翻译的多；质量高的少，重复的多。尤其是初级、中级的通俗读本更少。因此，要大力开展技术情报和出版工作。
    建立全国机械产品设计与研究网
    毛泽东同志说过：把群众力量组织起来，这是一种方针。各个系统、各个企业、单位的设计工作革命化了，固然会产生物质力量，但是，它究竟还是分散的力量，还要进一步在全国范围内把它汇集起来，成为一股巨大的力量。
    目前，需要在全国范围内，把各行各业，包括使用部门在内的产品设计和研究力量，组成一个机械产品设计与研究网。不论大小工厂都应当有自己的设计机构。在同一行业内，可以组成专业小组，组内组外互通情况，并定时召开年会，以交流经验，总结经验，互相协作，共同提高。
                      ×　×　×
    目前我国机械产品设计人员的水平还不高，但是，经过这次革命运动，我们将逐步学会活学活用毛泽东思想，逐步树立起全心全意为人民服务的观点，几年之后，必然会成为一支强大的又红又专的设计队伍，成为我国赶上和超过世界先进水平的强大技术力量。让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，树雄心，立壮志，鼓足干劲，奋勇前进。
