    Johnson Relies on Dogs for Help
    Poem by Chi Beiou, Drawing by Miao Di
    Not enough soldiers,
        Why not conscript dogs?
    Regardless of male or female,
        Regardless of fat or thin,
    The more the better,
        Search for them in large quantities.
    Dogs are stronger than people,
        Accept and include everything.
    Woof woof woof woof,
        Can attack and defend.
    Morale is higher,
        Won't tremble in battle;
    Supply is easier,
        No need for beer or canned goods;
    More mobile,
        Four legs are good at running away;
    More clever,
        Won't be beaten in their sleeping bags.
    There's another great advantage:
        Once a dog's life is lost,
        It saves on a coffin.
    Let's see if the first dog division
        Can help Johnson or not?
    According to reports, the Johnson government, plagued by a shortage of soldiers, is stepping up the conscription of military dogs to "help guard American military bases in Vietnam." The US Department of Defense has decided to double the number of military dogs sent to South Vietnam, reaching two thousand.

    约翰逊靠狗帮忙
    池北偶诗  苗地画
    兵员不够，
    何妨征狗。
    不分公母，
    不论肥瘦，
    多多益善，
    大量搜求。
    狗比人强，
    并蓄兼收。
    汪汪汪汪，
    能攻能守。
    士气高些，
    临阵不会发抖；
    供应易些，
    不用啤酒罐头；
    比较机动，
    四条腿善于逃走；
    比较机灵，
    不致被窝里挨揍。
    还有一大好处：
    一旦丢了狗命，
    省却棺材一口。
    且看第一狗兵师
    能给约翰逊帮忙否？
    据报道，为兵员短缺所苦的约翰逊政府，加紧征用军犬来“帮助警卫美国在越南的军事基地”。美国国防部决定把派往南越的军犬增加一倍，达到两千只。
