    Taking the Best from All, Following Our Own Path

        Inferiority and Confidence

    Our burns ward was established in 1958, in response to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. At the beginning of the ward's establishment, out of ignorance, we simultaneously rescued patients and consulted relevant literature on burns, sending personnel to Shanghai Guangci Hospital for training. For us at the time, who were starting from scratch, any knowledge or experience related to burns was like water in the desert, and we swallowed it all. However, the results of the rescue were disappointing. In the early days of the ward's establishment, although comrades worked selflessly day and night, many critically ill patients still died one after another. Faced with this reality, everyone felt heavy-hearted and also raised questions: Why are the successful experiences that are effective for others not working for us? At the time, we did not find the correct answer to this question, and some comrades even developed feelings of inferiority. Some said, "Foreigners have been dealing with burns for hundreds of years; we've only been doing it for a few days!" Some said, "They have good equipment; our hospital doesn't have the conditions to treat burns!" Others said, "Domestic and foreign units dealing with burns all have experts; we are either halfway 'converts' or young doctors who have only graduated for a year or two. It won't work!" Is that really the case? Is it impossible to surpass the hundreds of years of history of capitalist countries? Are equipment conditions the determining factor? Can young people not accomplish anything? The comrades of our hospital's Party committee saw these questions very clearly and understood that the crux of the problem was not elsewhere but in our own thinking. Under the enlightenment and direct help of the Party committee, we began to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" and began to summarize our own experiences and lessons learned in rescue work. All of this armed our minds, clarified the direction of progress, and boosted our confidence. Roads are made by walking, things can be understood, unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions, and a blank piece of paper is perfect for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures. So, why should we belittle ourselves and be content with incompetence?

        Daring to Practice and Diligent in Thinking

    Some people often ask us with incomprehension, "When you're rescuing patients, you're immersed in the ward all day, surrounding the patients all day. Is there so much work to do?" — Yes! Don't we lack experience? Then, the more we observe and do, won't we gain experience? In clinical practice, a large number of vivid materials and problems are presented to us, far richer and more complex than those in books. Many new problems appear before us, and there are no answers in books, requiring us to solve them ourselves. Through repeated practice, constantly summarizing experience, and drawing on the experience of predecessors and others, over time, experience accumulates, solutions emerge, and new realms are opened up.

    Feeding patients seems to be a nurse's job. But if doctors personally feed patients, they will have a more concrete understanding of the patients' appetites; the more they feed, the more they will gradually understand the changes in appetite and dietary patterns of burn patients. Looking at a wound once and handling it once will bring completely different feelings; the more you handle it, the more you will gradually understand the patterns of burn wound evolution. If you only listen to case reports and look at medical records without personally observing and examining patients in detail, the diagnosis of the condition is often wrong, leading to irreparable losses in the rescue work. We have profound experience in all of this.

    Each time we accept a new patient, we look, compare, and think more, find the characteristics of the patient, and then formulate a rescue plan that is more practical. After the rescue is completed, whether it is successful or a failure, we must summarize the experience and lessons learned. In this way, every time we rescue a patient, we can add something new to the field of knowledge of burn treatment.

    Through accumulated careful observation, some comrades finally discovered the different reactions of dry and wet eschars on patients, thereby realizing the important principle that eschar has two sides. Starting from this point, through everyone's efforts, we tried hundreds of wound treatment methods and initially summarized a set of early eschar protection measures. In the face of the vast open wounds of severely burned patients, we began to move from passive to active.

    Rescue practice has taught us: Roads are made by walking; without walking, where does the road come from? People always have to walk, and people who use their brains will walk better.

      Analyzing the Strengths and Weaknesses of Ourselves and Others

    When we are ignorant, we only see the strengths of others, thinking that the experiences of others are useful to us; when we have some experience, we only see the shortcomings of others, thinking that the experiences of others are not worth learning from. The truth is, of course, not like that. Whether it is us or others, there are strengths and weaknesses, the problem is to have an analytical attitude and be good at learning.

    In this regard, we have also gone through tortuous paths. Initially, we lacked methods for treating deep burns. After learning about eschar excision surgery, we used eschar excision for all patients, regardless of the size of the burn area. As a result, some patients with large areas of burns died because they could not withstand the impact of the surgery. After that, we went to another extreme, thinking that deep burns could not be treated with eschar excision surgery. This method was shelved for several years. Later, after continuous exploration, we realized that although eschar excision could cause death in patients with large areas of burns, it could achieve good results in shortening the course of treatment and improving function in patients with small and medium-sized burns. Now, we understand even better that eschar excision surgery itself has many advantages. The reason why it is not suitable for patients with large areas of burns is that the current conditions are not yet available (such as the lack of skin sources for patients with large areas of burns). If we actively work hard and create conditions, eschar excision surgery still has prospects for development in the treatment of patients with large areas of burns.

    In 1961, we continuously saved a batch of patients with large areas of burns; in 1964, we also saved a burn patient with a total area of 96%; at the same time, we have summarized some experience in rescuing burns over the past few years. At this time, we became somewhat complacent. However, rescue practice has raised a serious question for us: Why has our level of rescuing large areas of deep burns not improved quickly in recent years? Using this question to examine our work, we saw our shortcomings. At this time, the Party committee sent us to Shanghai Guangci Hospital for further study. After a month of study, we discovered that what they were good at was precisely what we were bad at. In recent years, Guangci Hospital has accumulated rich experience in treating severe infections and the combined use of autologous and allogeneic skin. These are precisely the key to treating large areas of deep burns at present, which has been very enlightening to us. At the same time, through careful comparison, we also clarified that we have our own characteristics in certain aspects. In this way, through the comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of ourselves and others, our minds became clear. We became even more confident in moving forward on the current basis.

      Drawing on the Strengths of All, Paving Our Own Path

    Inheritance is not conservatism, and learning is not copying blindly. Drawing on the strengths of all, in the final analysis, is to pave our own path.

    Some people say that Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in burn patients is impossible to control because Pseudomonas aeruginosa exists in human feces, and when patients defecate, Pseudomonas aeruginosa will contaminate the wound. Learning this increased our knowledge and helped us understand that Pseudomonas aeruginosa exists not only in the natural environment but also in human feces. But we were not satisfied with this. We conducted our own investigation of thousands of fecal specimens and found that only 1.1% had Pseudomonas aeruginosa, not the 10% stated in the literature. So, we came to a new conclusion: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in burn patients can be controlled. After several years of efforts, we have basically controlled Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in burn patients.

    After reading books, we learned that the British used positive pressure ventilators for air disinfection. We spent tens of thousands of yuan to install one as well. In actual use, the effect was not good. Later, our medical staff worked together, explored for a long time, learned and tried almost all the experiences of various schools, and finally found that natural ventilation is the most economical and effective method of air disinfection.

    We took many detours in treating large areas of deep burns. Finally, we learned from Tangshan's experience of "ants gnawing bones" and saved some patients. We did not stop there but enriched this method with the eschar protection measures we had explored in practice, and the level of treatment improved another step.

    All of this shows that we must learn from the existing experiences and conclusions of others; but we must also verify, enrich, and develop them through our own practice. "Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is unique to ourselves," to create a new realm.

    取诸家之长，走自己的路
    北京市积水潭医院创伤骨科烧伤专业组住院医生　高智仁
        自　卑　和　自　信
    我们烧伤病房是于一九五八年适应工农业生产大跃进的形势建立的。病房成立之初，因为无知，我们便一边抢救，一边翻阅有关烧伤的文献书籍，派专人去上海广慈医院学习。对于当时一纸空白的我们来说，凡是有关烧伤的知识、经验，就好象沙漠里的水，我们一古脑儿都吞了下去。然而，抢救的结果却令人失望。病房初建的那些日子，同志们虽然不分昼夜忘我的工作，但不少重病人还是相继牺牲了。面对这个现实，大家心情沉痛，同时也提出了问题：为什么别人行之有效的成功经验，在我们这里就行不通呢？对于这个问题，当时我们没有找到正确的答案，有些同志还产生了自卑的思想。有人说：“外国人搞烧伤已有上百年的历史，我们这才几天啊！”有人说：“人家设备好，我们医院搞烧伤，没有条件！”也有人说：“国内外搞烧伤的单位都有专家，我们这些人，不是半途‘出家’的，就是刚毕业一两年的小大夫，不行！”真是这样吗？资本主义国家上百年的历史不可超越吗？设备条件是决定因素吗？年青人就不能有所作为吗？这些问题，我们医院党委会的同志看得很清楚，也明白问题的症结，不是在别处，而是在我们自己的思想上。在党委的启发教导和直接帮助下，我们开始学习毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》，并且着手总结自己抢救中的经验教训。这一切，武装了我们的头脑，明确了前进的方向，鼓舞了我们的信心。路是人走出来的，事物是可以被认识的，不利条件可以转化为有利条件，一纸空白正好画最新最美的画图。那么，我们为什么要妄自菲薄、自甘无能呢？
        勇于实践和勤于思索
    有的人常常以不能理解的心情问我们：“抢救的时候，你们整天泡在病房里，整天围着病人转，有那么多工作可做吗？”——有！我们不是没有经验吗？那么，多观察一些，多做一点，经验不就有了吗？在临床实践中，大量活生生的材料、问题摆在我们面前，远比书本上的丰富、复杂。许多新问题出现在我们面前，书本上没有答案，需要我们去着手解决。经过反复实践，不断总结经验，再加上借鉴前人和别人的经验，天长日久，经验积累了，办法生出来了，新的境界开拓了。
    喂饭，看来是护士的事。但是大夫亲自喂喂饭，就会对病人的食欲有更具体的了解；喂得次数多了，就慢慢摸索到烧伤病人食欲变化和饮食的规律。创面看一眼和动手处理一遍，就会有迥然不同的感受；处理得多了，就慢慢摸索到烧伤创面演变的规律。如果只听病情汇报、看病历资料，而不亲自详细观察病人、检查病人，做出的病情判断常常是错误的，以致给抢救工作带来不可弥补的损失。所有这些，我们都有深切的体验。
    每接受一个新病人，多看看、比比、想想，找出这个病人的特点，再制订抢救计划，就比较切合实际。抢救完毕，不管是成功还是失败，都要总结经验教训。这样，每抢救一个病人，我们都能在治疗烧伤这个知识领域里增添一点新东西。
    在日积月累的细心观察中，有的同志终于发现了干焦痂和湿焦痂在病人身上的不同反应，从而悟到了焦痂具有两面性这个重要道理。从这点出发，经过大家的努力，试用过上百种的创面处理方法，初步总结出一套早期保护焦痂的措施。在严重烧伤病人广大的开放创面面前，我们开始由被动转入主动了。
    抢救实践使我们懂得了：路是人走出来的，不走，哪来路。人总是要走路的，会动脑子的人，就会走得更好。
      有分析地对待彼我的长短
    当我们无知的时候，就只看别人的长处，以为别人的经验对自己都是有用的；当我们有了一些经验以后，又只看别人的短处，以为别人的经验没有什么值得自己学习的。事实当然不是这样。无论彼我，都有长短之处，问题是要有分析的态度，善于学习。
    这方面，我们也走过曲折的路程。开初，处理深度烧伤缺少办法。学了切痂手术以后，我们不管大小面积的病人都一律采用切痂。结果有些大面积的病人由于忍受不住手术的打击，牺牲了。这以后，我们又走向另一个极端，认为深度烧伤是不能用切痂手术治疗的。这种方法就这样被搁置了好几年。后来经过不断摸索，才知道切痂虽然可以使大面积烧伤病人致死，但在中、小面积烧伤病人身上却可以收到缩短疗程、改进功能的良好效果。现在，我们更懂得了，切痂手术本身有很多优点，它之所以不适于大面积烧伤病人，是因为目前的条件还不具备（如大面积烧伤病人皮肤来源不足）。如果我们积极努力，创造条件，切痂手术在大面积烧伤病人的治疗中仍有发展前途。
    一九六一年，我们连续救活了一批大面积烧伤病人；一九六四年，又救活了总面积达百分之九十六的烧伤病人；同时几年来又总结出一些抢救烧伤的经验。这时，我们就有些故步自封起来。但抢救实践却向我们提出了严肃的问题：为什么几年来，我们抢救大面积深度烧伤的水平提高不快呢？用这个问题来检查我们的工作，我们就看到自己的短处。这时候，党委又派我们去上海广慈医院学习。经过一个月的学习，发现彼之所长，正是我之所短。几年来广慈医院在治疗严重感染和自体皮、异体皮结合运用等方面积累了丰富的经验。而这些，正是目前治疗大面积深度烧伤的关键所在，对我们启发很大。同时经过认真的对比，也更明确了某些方面我们有自己的特点。这样通过彼我长短的对比，我们的头脑清醒了。对于在目前的基础上更加前进一步，信心就更足了。
      取诸家之长，走自己的路
    继承不是守旧，学习不是照葫芦画瓢。取诸家之长，归根到底，是为了走自己的路。
    有人说，烧伤病人的绿脓杆菌感染是无法控制的，因为人的粪便中就存在绿脓杆菌，病人要排便，绿脓杆菌就会污染创面。学了这一点，增加了我们的知识，懂得了绿脓杆菌不仅存在于自然环境中，还存在于人的粪便中。但我们并不以此为满足，又自己动手调查了上千份粪便标本，发现有绿脓杆菌的只有百分之一点一，而不是文献上所说的百分之十。于是我们得出新的结论，烧伤病人的绿脓杆菌感染是可以控制的。经过几年的努力，现在我们基本上控制住了烧伤病人的绿脓杆菌感染。
    读了书，我们知道英国人搞空气消毒，用的是正压通风机。我们花了上万元，也照样安了一个。实际一用，效果不灵。后来，我们医护人员一起动手，经过长期摸索，几乎学遍了、试遍了各家的经验，最后找出自然通风是空气消毒最经济最有效的方法。
    处理大面积深度烧伤创面，走了不少弯路，最后学了唐山市“蚂蚁啃骨头”的经验，救活了一些病人。我们没有停顿下来，又以自己在实践中摸索出的保痂措施丰富了这个方法，治疗水平便又提高了一步。
    所有这些，说明对别人已有的经验、结论，要学习它；但还要通过自己的实践去验证它、丰富它、发展它。“吸收那些用得着的东西，拒绝那些用不着的东西，增加那些自己所特有的东西”，开创出新的境地来。
