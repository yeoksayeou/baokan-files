　　踏遍山乡送报刊
　　思想问题解决了，心情愉快了，干起工作来浑身是劲。虽然工作中的困难一点没有减少，但因我头脑里有了毛泽东思想做指导，就有了克服困难的勇气和办法。
　　黑龙江省嘉荫县邮电局乡邮员　葛景龙
　　进行自我革命决心留在边疆
　　我的老家在山东省枣庄市峨山公社。解放前家里很穷。我一家六口，生活无依无靠，饥寒交迫。刚解放，父亲死去了。我们一家的生活，全靠人民政府的救济。我念了四年书，以后参加了农业生产。人民公社成立的时候，我担任团总支书记。一九五九年，党号召青年到边疆去参加建设，我响应号召来到了黑龙江边的嘉荫县。当时这里的条件虽然艰苦，但为了开发祖国的边疆，我和大伙都干得很起劲。一九六二年二月，建设任务告一段落，我被调到县邮电局当乡邮员。
　　当时我负责的邮路有一百二十公里，其中只有三十公里有道的影子，剩下的都是一片荒芜的小毛道。路上还要通过十二条没有桥的河。我头一回出班，地冻还没开化，道还好走。一个老乡邮员领着，我背了十来斤重的报纸和信件，一天走三十来里，往返用了八天的时间。第二次我自己出班，往返只用了五天。于是我向局长建议，把八天的班期改为五天。局长说：“不能改，一开化，道就不好走了，你尽量走吧，能快点更好，但要注意劳逸结合。”
　　四月末大地开化了，困难真的就一个接一个地上来了。有一次，我出班，走到太平头道河，一看冰排刚流完，河边上还有冰碴。我下水趟到河当中，身上冻的简直象针扎似的疼。过了河，一边走一边想，这道上共有十二道河，来回就得趟二十四次有冰碴的水，还不得冻出病来。再一想，到了夏季，下边踩着泥水走路，上边瞎虻、蚊子、小咬叮，这还不说，还有狼，更是危险。想到这些，我后悔在这里建设任务告一段落时，没和大伙一起回家。这时，我爱人又来信叫我回家，更使我情绪波动。但是，我又觉得一个共产党员怎能因为困难就离开工作岗位。当时思想很苦闷。正在这时，我们局里组织职工学习毛主席《关于重庆谈判》一文。毛主席在这篇文章中说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”“担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”我反复地琢磨毛主席的这些话，我想，我们的革命先辈，如果都象我这样，挑这拣那，见困难就退缩，那还能有今天的胜利吗？我又想到，从山东来的时候，曾表示要到最艰苦的地方去，自己常讲听党的话，听毛主席的话，现在，不正是考验自己的时候吗？我带着这些思想问题，重读了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，这两篇文章过去我虽然读过几遍了，但是从来没有象这次这么亲切。我越读越觉得惭愧。我反复想，我为什么来边疆？我在为谁工作？想想过去受的苦，是党救了我的一家，是党把我培养成人，没有党我那有今天，而我却忘了过去的苦，忘了党对我的培养，一个革命者在困难面前想退缩，这是什么思想？是资产阶级个人主义在作怪。这种思想会使自己脱离革命、脱离党，要革命就必须坚决克服这种错误思想。这时我认识到自己错了。我下了决心，革命需要我在这里，我一定安下心来，好好为人民服务，建设好祖国的边疆。有了毛泽东思想什么困难都不怕
　　思想问题解决了，心情愉快了，干起工作来全身是劲。虽然我工作中的困难一点也没减少，但因我头脑里有了毛泽东思想做指导，就有了克服困难的勇气和办法。毛主席说，
  “我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”我工作中的困难主要是：泥水、河流和野兽。这些困难，只要按照毛主席的指示，承认它，分析它，向它作斗争，都是可以克服的。
　　一九六二年八月的一天，下了一夜雨，第二天我顶着阴天出班。同志们劝我等天晴道干了再走，我说，群众不能等天晴道干了才看报，再说我还带着一份县委的紧急文件，等到天晴就可能误事，给工作造成损失。我背起信兜子出发了。不巧走到半路上，下起了瓢泼大雨，我脱下雨衣，把信兜子包好，一步一滑的往前走。天黑时到了结烈河口，河水已经出槽了，这条河是邮路上最大的一条河。平时就有五十多米宽，这回更宽了。我站在河边上愣住了。怎么办呢？回去吧，就得误班期，带给工作组的紧急文件送不到。是叫河水挡回去呢？还是战胜它完成任务呢？“在困难的时候……，要提高我们的勇气。”“一定能够排除万难，达到胜利的目的。”毛主席的这些教导鼓舞着我。我想，我会游泳，这是克服困难的有利条件，只要我充分利用这个有利条件，就能战胜眼前的困难。于是，我决定先空身游过去试一试，把信兜子放在岸上，就下了水，一气游到对岸，接着又往回游。因为考虑回来要拿信袋子，两只手不能一起动，我就试着用一只手划水，一只手举着，往回游，虽然费了很大劲，还是游回来了。经过这一试验，心里有了底。我在岸上歇了一会，就把信兜子顶在头上，一只手扶着，一只手划水，我用了全身的力气游过去了。当我走到稻田公社时，家家户户都已熄灯了。我叫开邮电所的门，话务员卢艳芳让我快换衣裳吃饭。我想送文件要紧，于是我就摸黑把文件送到了工作组的负责同志的手里，回来才吃饭。这一天，我虽然很累，但是却很愉快，因为我战胜了困难，完成了任务。
　　一九六三年四月我刚刚出班回来，听说局里要派两个人到汤旺河去取邮件。商业部门有辆大车在两天前就走了，必须在两天内赶到汤旺河，找着这辆大车把邮件运回来。我就去找班长和会计，要求把任务交给我。开始他们不答应，认为我刚回来应当休息。经我再三要求，才答应派我和押运员傅振清一块去。我们临出发的那天晚上下了一夜雨，道又滑又泞，每人还背了二十来斤的信袋子。走到太平头道河一看，大块小块冰排满河跑。要不过去，就得等开江后把邮件返回佳木斯，再用船运到嘉荫。这样，往返就得耽误一个多月。我下了决心，困难再大，也得完成任务。这道河水浅，可以趟过去。我和傅振清商量了一下，脱了衣服就趟。水到小肚子，冰得身上象刀子扎的一样疼，连气都喘不过来。上了岸，为了赶掉身上的寒气，我们抬腿就跑。身上刚有点热气又到了太平二道河，又照样从冰排缝里趟过去。我们一气走出六十多里地，到了振兴大队才吃早饭。这一天趟过了四道流着冰的大河，四道灌满了桃花水的小河。两腿冻得痛得钻心，跑也跑不动了，好容易才走到大砬子林场。第二天天不亮，我们又深一脚浅一脚地趟过了一片片塔头甸子，翻过一座大山，天快黑时才到汤旺河，终于胜利地完成了任务。
　　在我的邮路上，行人稀少，狼挺多，有时碰上一只两只，有时碰上三只五只。开始我总是提心吊胆的。学习了毛主席著作，使我增加了智慧和勇气。狼总是怕人的。狼多，群众对付狼的办法也多。我跟群众学会了很多和狼斗争的办法。有一回，遇见五只狼，蹲在离道边五十多米远的地方。躲也躲不开了，我就瞪着眼睛瞅着它们，两只手比划着，一步不停地闯了过去。增产大队党支部书记劝我不要走黑道，这里狼多，有危险。我想：危险是有，问题在于怎样对付它。人怕狼，狼更怕人。我跟狼斗过几回之后，胆子也就越来越大了，没有一次因为有狼影响我完成任务。
　　我战胜困难的过程，就是学习和运用毛泽东思想解决实际问题的过程。我深深地体会到：只要按照毛主席的指示去做，就能战胜一切困难，做好革命工作。要按照毛主席的指示办事，就必须努力学习毛主席著作。所以，虽然我的工作几乎天天走路，工作很累，时间很少，但我每天至少要学习一小时，现在我已经学了四十多篇毛主席著作。时刻想着人民想着革命工作
　　我负责的邮区共有四千多人，一九六二年二月我刚接手的时候，只有三十七份报纸，到第二季度才增加到七十多份，九个小学只订了一份《中国少年报》。有个老乡邮员和我说：“道不好走，收订报刊要控制点，多了背不动，自己挨累。”我当时还认为他这是一片好心。后来我学习了毛主席《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》，认识到做报刊投递工作，实际上是在完成宣传党的方针政策的任务。我想报纸刊物发行的太少，就不能使党的方针政策最广泛地同群众见面。尤其在这山沟里，交通不便，群众对国内外大事知道得少，不多发行报刊，上哪去了解国内外大事，上哪去学习先进思想先进经验呢？为了发挥报刊的作用，我找邮区内的大队党支部书记，宣传订阅报刊和研究扩大报刊发行的办法。他们都说：“不是不愿订，是送的晚，十天八天送一趟，还不直接送到家，托人捎，又经常丢。所以不愿意再订。”我对他们说：“我保证按时送到，一张不缺，请放心。”
　　为了扩大报刊发行量，早点把报刊送到群众手里，我学习愚公移山的精神，决定把班期再缩短一些，我试验着把五天的道并成四天走，后来又并成三天走。开始很累，时间长了就练出来了。群众管我叫“飞毛腿”、“准时钟”。同时，我又大力向群众宣传订阅报刊的好处，组织各单位订阅报刊。山里有九个生产单位，连一份报纸也没有。我就向这些单位的领导提意见说：“工人成年在山里劳动，不看报思想就得上锈，你们应当给他们订几份报纸。”他们回答说：“你的意见很好，我们今天晚上就研究。”第二天这九个单位都订了一份报纸。我负责的邮区，经过宣传介绍，一九六三年底，报刊发行量增加到三百多份，现在已经发行七十多种，一千七百多份。订阅份数比我刚接手时增加了四十六倍。我的邮区现在平均不到三个人就有一份报纸或刊物。随着报刊发行量的增加，我的负担也随着加重了。我想为人民服务，首先就应该想到人民，想到革命，自己虽然累点，但当我看到报纸发挥作用时，感到无限的愉快。
　　报刊发的多了，送的也快了。我认为做乡邮员，不仅要把报纸准确及时地送到群众的手里，而且要在群众中做好宣传。为了做到这一点，一九六五年以来，我在分拣报纸的时候，或在路上休息的时候，就把报纸的主要内容看一遍。在投递的时候，先告诉社员报上有什么大事。农忙的时候，我就把报纸送到地里，赶上歇晌，我就给大家念一段。
　　原先我认为，自己不嫌担子重，不怕吃苦不怕累，就已经是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务了。但当我学了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》以后，用毛主席说的“……一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。”按照这句话一检查，才认识到自己为人民服务得还不“完全”，不“彻底”。群众寄一封信还得走十几里甚至几十里路到邮电所或邮电局。从这以后，我就在出班时带着邮票和信封信纸，群众寄信我就给捎着。可是还有些群众叫我给代取代汇钱款，因为上级明文规定不准乡邮员代取代汇，我就向群众解释，但是群众还要求我来代办。后来，有的大队党支部书记代表群众要求说：“咱这里离县城远，去取点钱或汇点钱来回就得三四天，影响生产，群众又劳累，你就给办了吧。”这一下子才使我考虑到，订立规章制度是为了让我们更好地为人民服务，不是限制为人民服务，在我们这交通极不方便的地方，要从实际出发，从群众的要求出发，执行制度也得因地制宜。我把这种想法和局长谈了，局长也同意我的看法。为了方便群众，不影响生产，在群众的要求下，我三年多来为群众代取代汇钱款三万多元，没出一次差错，群众很满意。从这件事里使我又认识到，为人民服务是无限的。此后凡是群众提出要求，我能办到的，就都尽力去办。比如，有人托我给买药，有的妇女生孩子叫我给捎鸡蛋，等等，我都按群众的要求办到了。
　　几年来，我从毛主席的书里找到了革命的方向，找到了无穷的力量。我在工作中所取得的成绩，也就是遵照毛主席的教导的结果。今后我一定要加倍努力学习毛主席著作，力争把工作做得更好。（附图片）

　　Traversing Mountain Villages to Deliver Newspapers and Periodicals
　　With my ideological problems resolved, my mood is cheerful, and I feel energetic in my work. Although the difficulties in my work have not decreased, because I have Mao Zedong Thought to guide me, I have the courage and methods to overcome them.
　　Ge Jinglong, Rural Postman, Jiayin County Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Heilongjiang Province
　　Determined to Stay in the Frontier Through Self-Revolution
　　My old home is in Eshan Commune, Zaozhuang City, Shandong Province. Before liberation, my family was very poor. My family of six was destitute, living in hunger and cold. Soon after liberation, my father died. Our family's life depended entirely on the relief from the People's Government. I studied for four years and then participated in agricultural production. When the People's Commune was established, I served as the secretary of the Youth League branch. In 1959, when the Party called on young people to go to the frontier to participate in construction, I responded and came to Jiayin County on the Heilongjiang border. Although conditions were difficult at the time, I and everyone else worked hard to develop our country's frontier. In February 1962, when the construction task came to an end, I was transferred to the county post and telecommunications bureau as a rural postman.
　　At that time, my postal route was 120 kilometers long, of which only 30 kilometers had a semblance of a road, and the rest were desolate small paths. The route also had to cross twelve rivers without bridges. The first time I went out, the ground was still frozen, and the road was relatively easy to travel. Led by an old rural postman, I carried over ten pounds of newspapers and letters, walking thirty li a day, taking eight days for the round trip. The second time I went out on my own, the round trip only took five days. So I suggested to the director that the eight-day schedule be changed to five days. The director said, "It can't be changed. Once it thaws, the road will be difficult to travel. Try to go as fast as you can, but pay attention to the combination of work and rest."
　　At the end of April, the earth thawed, and difficulties really came one after another. Once, when I went out, I reached Taiping Toudao River and saw that the ice floes had just finished flowing, and there were still ice shavings on the riverbank. I waded into the river, and my body felt as if it was being pricked by needles. After crossing the river, I walked and thought that there were twelve rivers on this route, and I would have to wade through water with ice shavings twenty-four times for the round trip, and I would probably get sick. Then I thought that in the summer, I would be walking in mud and water, stung by horseflies, mosquitoes, and gnats, not to mention the danger of wolves. Thinking of these things, I regretted not returning home with everyone else when the construction task here came to an end. At this time, my wife wrote to me again, asking me to go home, which made my emotions fluctuate even more. However, I also felt that a Communist Party member could not leave his post because of difficulties. At that time, I was very distressed ideologically. Just then, our bureau organized employees to study Chairman Mao's article "On the Chongqing Negotiations." In this article, Chairman Mao said, "What is work? Work is struggle." "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. That is a good comrade." "There are heavy and light burdens. Some people pick the light and fear the heavy, pushing the heavy burdens onto others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude." I pondered Chairman Mao's words repeatedly, thinking that if our revolutionary predecessors were all like me, picking and choosing, and shrinking back when faced with difficulties, how could we have today's victory? I also thought that when I came from Shandong, I had said that I wanted to go to the most difficult place, and I often said that I would listen to the Party and Chairman Mao. Now, isn't it time to test myself? With these ideological problems, I reread "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Although I had read these two articles several times in the past, they had never been as intimate as this time. The more I read, the more ashamed I felt. I repeatedly asked myself, why did I come to the frontier? Who am I working for? Thinking of the suffering I had endured in the past, it was the Party that saved my family, and it was the Party that raised me to adulthood. Without the Party, where would I be today? But I had forgotten the suffering of the past and the Party's cultivation of me. What kind of thinking is it for a revolutionary to want to shrink back in the face of difficulties? It is bourgeois individualism at work. This kind of thinking will lead me to deviate from the revolution and from the Party. To make revolution, I must resolutely overcome this erroneous thinking. At this time, I realized that I was wrong. I made up my mind that if the revolution needs me here, I must settle down, serve the people well, and build up the frontier of our country. With Mao Zedong Thought, I fear no difficulties.
　　With my ideological problems resolved, my mood is cheerful, and I feel energetic in my work. Although the difficulties in my work have not decreased, because I have Mao Zedong Thought to guide me, I have the courage and methods to overcome them. Chairman Mao said, "We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties." The main difficulties in my work are: mud, rivers, and wild animals. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, acknowledge them, analyze them, and struggle against them, these difficulties can be overcome.
　　One day in August 1962, it rained all night. The next day, I went out in the cloudy weather. My comrades advised me to wait until the weather cleared and the road dried before leaving, but I said that the masses cannot wait until the weather clears and the road dries before reading the newspaper, and besides, I was carrying an urgent document from the county party committee, and waiting until the weather cleared might delay things and cause losses to the work. I set off with my mailbag. Unfortunately, halfway there, it started pouring rain. I took off my raincoat, wrapped the mailbag well, and walked forward, slipping and sliding. When it got dark, I reached the mouth of the Jielie River. The river water had already overflowed its banks. This river is the largest river on the postal route. Usually, it is more than fifty meters wide, but this time it was even wider. I stood on the riverbank, stunned. What to do? If I went back, I would miss the schedule, and the urgent document for the work team would not be delivered. Should I let the river block me, or should I overcome it and complete the task? "In times of difficulty... we must raise our courage." "We will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve the goal of victory." Chairman Mao's teachings encouraged me. I thought, I can swim, which is a favorable condition for overcoming difficulties. As long as I make full use of this favorable condition, I can overcome the immediate difficulties. So, I decided to swim across empty-handed first to test it out. I put the mailbag on the shore and went into the water, swimming to the other side in one breath, and then swimming back. Because I had to consider carrying the mailbag back, and I couldn't move both hands at the same time, I tried using one hand to paddle and holding the other hand up, swimming back. Although it took a lot of effort, I still swam back. After this test, I felt confident. I rested on the shore for a while, then put the mailbag on my head, holding it with one hand and paddling with the other, and swam across with all my strength. When I arrived at the Daotian Commune, every household had already turned off the lights. I knocked on the door of the post office, and the telephone operator, Lu Yanfang, told me to change my clothes and eat quickly. I thought that delivering the document was important, so I delivered the document to the comrade in charge of the work team in the dark before eating. Although I was very tired that day, I was very happy because I had overcome difficulties and completed the task.
　　In April 1963, I had just returned from my run when I heard that the bureau was going to send two people to Tangwang River to pick up mail. The commercial department had sent a large cart two days ago, and it was necessary to rush to Tangwang River within two days to find the cart and transport the mail back. I went to the squad leader and the accountant and asked them to give me the task. At first, they didn't agree, thinking that I should rest since I had just returned. After my repeated requests, they agreed to send me and the escort Fu Zhenqing together. The night before we set off, it rained all night, and the road was slippery and muddy. Each of us carried mailbags weighing twenty or so pounds. When we reached Taiping Toudao River, we saw large and small ice floes running all over the river. If we didn't cross, we would have to wait until the river opened up and return the mail to Jiamusi, and then transport it to Jiayin by boat. This would delay the round trip by more than a month. I made up my mind that no matter how great the difficulties, I had to complete the task. The river was shallow and could be waded across. Fu Zhenqing and I discussed it, took off our clothes, and waded in. The water reached our bellies, and the ice felt like knives stabbing our bodies, making it impossible to breathe. After getting ashore, we ran to get rid of the cold. We had just gotten a little warm when we reached Taiping Erdao River, and we waded through the cracks in the ice floes in the same way. We walked more than sixty li in one breath and had breakfast when we reached the Zhenxing Brigade. That day, we waded across four large rivers with ice and four small rivers filled with peach blossom water. Our legs were frozen and aching, and we couldn't run anymore. With great difficulty, we reached the Daliazi Forest Farm. The next day, before dawn, we waded through patches of tussock meadows and climbed over a large mountain, finally reaching Tangwang River when it was almost dark, and successfully completing the task.
　　On my postal route, there are few pedestrians and many wolves. Sometimes I encounter one or two, sometimes three or five. At first, I was always apprehensive. Studying Chairman Mao's works increased my wisdom and courage. Wolves are always afraid of people. There are many wolves, and the masses have many ways to deal with them. I learned many ways to fight wolves from the masses. Once, I encountered five wolves squatting more than fifty meters away from the roadside. I couldn't avoid them, so I stared at them, gesturing with both hands, and rushed past them without stopping. The party branch secretary of the Zengchan Brigade advised me not to take the dark road, as there were many wolves and it was dangerous. I thought: Danger exists, but the question is how to deal with it. People fear wolves, but wolves fear people even more. After fighting wolves a few times, I became bolder and bolder, and there was never a time when wolves affected my completion of the task.
　　My process of overcoming difficulties is the process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems. I deeply realize that as long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can overcome all difficulties and do a good job in revolutionary work. To act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, although my work involves walking almost every day, and the work is very tiring and time is short, I study for at least one hour every day, and I have now studied more than forty articles by Chairman Mao. Always thinking of the people, thinking of revolutionary work.
　　There are more than 4,000 people in my postal district. When I took over in February 1962, there were only 37 newspapers. By the second quarter, the number had increased to more than 70. Only one copy of the "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" was subscribed to by nine primary schools. An old rural postman told me, "The road is difficult to travel. The collection and subscription of newspapers and periodicals should be controlled. If there are too many, it will be difficult to carry, and you will tire yourself out." At the time, I thought he was being kind. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin Sui Daily," I realized that doing newspaper and periodical delivery work is actually completing the task of publicizing the Party's policies. I thought that if too few newspapers and periodicals were distributed, the Party's policies could not reach the masses most widely. Especially in this mountain valley, where transportation is inconvenient, the masses know little about domestic and international affairs. If we don't distribute more newspapers and periodicals, where can we learn about domestic and international events and learn advanced ideas and experiences? In order to give full play to the role of newspapers and periodicals, I looked for the party branch secretaries of the brigades in the postal district to publicize the subscription of newspapers and periodicals and study ways to expand their distribution. They all said, "It's not that we don't want to subscribe, but the delivery is late. It's delivered every ten or eight days, and it's not delivered directly to our homes. We have to ask someone to bring it, and it's often lost. So we don't want to subscribe anymore." I said to them, "I guarantee to deliver it on time, without missing a single copy. Please rest assured."
　　In order to expand the circulation of newspapers and periodicals and deliver them to the masses sooner, I studied the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain and decided to shorten the schedule further. I experimented with combining the five-day route into four days, and later into three days. At first, it was very tiring, but after a long time, I got used to it. The masses call me "Flying Legs" and "On-time Clock." At the same time, I vigorously publicized the benefits of subscribing to newspapers and periodicals to the masses and organized various units to subscribe. There are nine production units in the mountains, and not even one newspaper. I raised objections to the leaders of these units, saying, "Workers work in the mountains all year round. If they don't read the newspapers, their minds will become rusty. You should subscribe to a few newspapers for them." They replied, "Your opinion is very good. We will study it tonight." The next day, all nine units subscribed to a newspaper. In my postal district, after publicity and introduction, by the end of 1963, the circulation of newspapers and periodicals had increased to more than 300 copies, and now more than 70 kinds of newspapers and periodicals are distributed, with more than 1,700 copies. The number of subscriptions has increased forty-six times since I took over. My postal district now has an average of one newspaper or periodical for every three people. As the circulation of newspapers and periodicals increases, my burden also increases. I think that to serve the people, I must first think of the people and think of the revolution. Although I am a little tired, I feel infinitely happy when I see the newspapers playing their role.
　　The more newspapers and periodicals are distributed, the faster they are delivered. I believe that as a rural postman, I must not only deliver the newspapers accurately and timely to the masses but also do a good job of publicity among the masses. In order to do this, since 1965, when I am sorting newspapers or resting on the road, I read the main content of the newspapers. When delivering them, I first tell the commune members what major events are in the newspapers. During the busy farming season, I deliver the newspapers to the fields, and when it's time for a break, I read a passage to everyone.
　　Originally, I thought that if I didn't mind the heavy burden, didn't fear hardship or fatigue, I would already be serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly." But after I studied "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods," and used Chairman Mao's words "... all these issues concerning the well-being of the masses should be put on our agenda," I realized that I was not serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly." The masses have to walk more than a dozen or even dozens of miles to the post office or telecommunications bureau to send a letter. From then on, I carried stamps, envelopes, and stationery with me when I went out, and I would take the letters that the masses wanted to send. However, some people asked me to collect and remit money on their behalf. Because the higher authorities expressly stipulated that rural postmen were not allowed to collect and remit money on their behalf, I explained it to the masses, but they still asked me to do it. Later, the party branch secretary of some brigades, representing the masses, asked me, "We are far from the county seat. It takes three or four days to go and get money or remit money, which affects production and makes the masses tired. Just do it for us." This made me realize that the purpose of establishing rules and regulations is to enable us to serve the people better, not to restrict us from serving the people. In our place where transportation is extremely inconvenient, we must proceed from reality and from the demands of the masses, and the implementation of the system must also be adapted to local conditions. I discussed this idea with the director, and the director agreed with my view. In order to facilitate the masses and not affect production, at the request of the masses, I have collected and remitted more than 30,000 yuan for the masses in the past three years, without making a single mistake, and the masses are very satisfied. From this incident, I realized again that serving the people is infinite. From then on, whenever the masses made a request, I would do my best to do it. For example, some people asked me to buy medicine for them, some women asked me to bring eggs when they gave birth, and so on. I did everything according to the needs of the masses.
　　In the past few years, I have found the direction of the revolution and found infinite strength from Chairman Mao's books. The achievements I have made in my work are the result of following Chairman Mao's teachings. In the future, I must redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works and strive to do my job even better. (Attached picture)

    黑龙江省嘉荫县邮电局乡邮员　葛景龙
    进行自我革命决心留在边疆
    我的老家在山东省枣庄市峨山公社。解放前家里很穷。我一家六口，生活无依无靠，饥寒交迫。刚解放，父亲死去了。我们一家的生活，全靠人民政府的救济。我念了四年书，以后参加了农业生产。人民公社成立的时候，我担任团总支书记。一九五九年，党号召青年到边疆去参加建设，我响应号召来到了黑龙江边的嘉荫县。当时这里的条件虽然艰苦，但为了开发祖国的边疆，我和大伙都干得很起劲。一九六二年二月，建设任务告一段落，我被调到县邮电局当乡邮员。
    当时我负责的邮路有一百二十公里，其中只有三十公里有道的影子，剩下的都是一片荒芜的小毛道。路上还要通过十二条没有桥的河。我头一回出班，地冻还没开化，道还好走。一个老乡邮员领着，我背了十来斤重的报纸和信件，一天走三十来里，往返用了八天的时间。第二次我自己出班，往返只用了五天。于是我向局长建议，把八天的班期改为五天。局长说：“不能改，一开化，道就不好走了，你尽量走吧，能快点更好，但要注意劳逸结合。”
    四月末大地开化了，困难真的就一个接一个地上来了。有一次，我出班，走到太平头道河，一看冰排刚流完，河边上还有冰碴。我下水趟到河当中，身上冻的简直象针扎似的疼。过了河，一边走一边想，这道上共有十二道河，来回就得趟二十四次有冰碴的水，还不得冻出病来。再一想，到了夏季，下边踩着泥水走路，上边瞎虻、蚊子、小咬叮，这还不说，还有狼，更是危险。想到这些，我后悔在这里建设任务告一段落时，没和大伙一起回家。这时，我爱人又来信叫我回家，更使我情绪波动。但是，我又觉得一个共产党员怎能因为困难就离开工作岗位。当时思想很苦闷。正在这时，我们局里组织职工学习毛主席《关于重庆谈判》一文。毛主席在这篇文章中说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”“担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”我反复地琢磨毛主席的这些话，我想，我们的革命先辈，如果都象我这样，挑这拣那，见困难就退缩，那还能有今天的胜利吗？我又想到，从山东来的时候，曾表示要到最艰苦的地方去，自己常讲听党的话，听毛主席的话，现在，不正是考验自己的时候吗？我带着这些思想问题，重读了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，这两篇文章过去我虽然读过几遍了，但是从来没有象这次这么亲切。我越读越觉得惭愧。我反复想，我为什么来边疆？我在为谁工作？想想过去受的苦，是党救了我的一家，是党把我培养成人，没有党我那有今天，而我却忘了过去的苦，忘了党对我的培养，一个革命者在困难面前想退缩，这是什么思想？是资产阶级个人主义在作怪。这种思想会使自己脱离革命、脱离党，要革命就必须坚决克服这种错误思想。这时我认识到自己错了。我下了决心，革命需要我在这里，我一定安下心来，好好为人民服务，建设好祖国的边疆。有了毛泽东思想什么困难都不怕
    思想问题解决了，心情愉快了，干起工作来全身是劲。虽然我工作中的困难一点也没减少，但因我头脑里有了毛泽东思想做指导，就有了克服困难的勇气和办法。毛主席说，
  “我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”我工作中的困难主要是：泥水、河流和野兽。这些困难，只要按照毛主席的指示，承认它，分析它，向它作斗争，都是可以克服的。
    一九六二年八月的一天，下了一夜雨，第二天我顶着阴天出班。同志们劝我等天晴道干了再走，我说，群众不能等天晴道干了才看报，再说我还带着一份县委的紧急文件，等到天晴就可能误事，给工作造成损失。我背起信兜子出发了。不巧走到半路上，下起了瓢泼大雨，我脱下雨衣，把信兜子包好，一步一滑的往前走。天黑时到了结烈河口，河水已经出槽了，这条河是邮路上最大的一条河。平时就有五十多米宽，这回更宽了。我站在河边上愣住了。怎么办呢？回去吧，就得误班期，带给工作组的紧急文件送不到。是叫河水挡回去呢？还是战胜它完成任务呢？“在困难的时候……，要提高我们的勇气。”“一定能够排除万难，达到胜利的目的。”毛主席的这些教导鼓舞着我。我想，我会游泳，这是克服困难的有利条件，只要我充分利用这个有利条件，就能战胜眼前的困难。于是，我决定先空身游过去试一试，把信兜子放在岸上，就下了水，一气游到对岸，接着又往回游。因为考虑回来要拿信袋子，两只手不能一起动，我就试着用一只手划水，一只手举着，往回游，虽然费了很大劲，还是游回来了。经过这一试验，心里有了底。我在岸上歇了一会，就把信兜子顶在头上，一只手扶着，一只手划水，我用了全身的力气游过去了。当我走到稻田公社时，家家户户都已熄灯了。我叫开邮电所的门，话务员卢艳芳让我快换衣裳吃饭。我想送文件要紧，于是我就摸黑把文件送到了工作组的负责同志的手里，回来才吃饭。这一天，我虽然很累，但是却很愉快，因为我战胜了困难，完成了任务。
    一九六三年四月我刚刚出班回来，听说局里要派两个人到汤旺河去取邮件。商业部门有辆大车在两天前就走了，必须在两天内赶到汤旺河，找着这辆大车把邮件运回来。我就去找班长和会计，要求把任务交给我。开始他们不答应，认为我刚回来应当休息。经我再三要求，才答应派我和押运员傅振清一块去。我们临出发的那天晚上下了一夜雨，道又滑又泞，每人还背了二十来斤的信袋子。走到太平头道河一看，大块小块冰排满河跑。要不过去，就得等开江后把邮件返回佳木斯，再用船运到嘉荫。这样，往返就得耽误一个多月。我下了决心，困难再大，也得完成任务。这道河水浅，可以趟过去。我和傅振清商量了一下，脱了衣服就趟。水到小肚子，冰得身上象刀子扎的一样疼，连气都喘不过来。上了岸，为了赶掉身上的寒气，我们抬腿就跑。身上刚有点热气又到了太平二道河，又照样从冰排缝里趟过去。我们一气走出六十多里地，到了振兴大队才吃早饭。这一天趟过了四道流着冰的大河，四道灌满了桃花水的小河。两腿冻得痛得钻心，跑也跑不动了，好容易才走到大砬子林场。第二天天不亮，我们又深一脚浅一脚地趟过了一片片塔头甸子，翻过一座大山，天快黑时才到汤旺河，终于胜利地完成了任务。
    在我的邮路上，行人稀少，狼挺多，有时碰上一只两只，有时碰上三只五只。开始我总是提心吊胆的。学习了毛主席著作，使我增加了智慧和勇气。狼总是怕人的。狼多，群众对付狼的办法也多。我跟群众学会了很多和狼斗争的办法。有一回，遇见五只狼，蹲在离道边五十多米远的地方。躲也躲不开了，我就瞪着眼睛瞅着它们，两只手比划着，一步不停地闯了过去。增产大队党支部书记劝我不要走黑道，这里狼多，有危险。我想：危险是有，问题在于怎样对付它。人怕狼，狼更怕人。我跟狼斗过几回之后，胆子也就越来越大了，没有一次因为有狼影响我完成任务。
    我战胜困难的过程，就是学习和运用毛泽东思想解决实际问题的过程。我深深地体会到：只要按照毛主席的指示去做，就能战胜一切困难，做好革命工作。要按照毛主席的指示办事，就必须努力学习毛主席著作。所以，虽然我的工作几乎天天走路，工作很累，时间很少，但我每天至少要学习一小时，现在我已经学了四十多篇毛主席著作。时刻想着人民想着革命工作
    我负责的邮区共有四千多人，一九六二年二月我刚接手的时候，只有三十七份报纸，到第二季度才增加到七十多份，九个小学只订了一份《中国少年报》。有个老乡邮员和我说：“道不好走，收订报刊要控制点，多了背不动，自己挨累。”我当时还认为他这是一片好心。后来我学习了毛主席《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》，认识到做报刊投递工作，实际上是在完成宣传党的方针政策的任务。我想报纸刊物发行的太少，就不能使党的方针政策最广泛地同群众见面。尤其在这山沟里，交通不便，群众对国内外大事知道得少，不多发行报刊，上哪去了解国内外大事，上哪去学习先进思想先进经验呢？为了发挥报刊的作用，我找邮区内的大队党支部书记，宣传订阅报刊和研究扩大报刊发行的办法。他们都说：“不是不愿订，是送的晚，十天八天送一趟，还不直接送到家，托人捎，又经常丢。所以不愿意再订。”我对他们说：“我保证按时送到，一张不缺，请放心。”
    为了扩大报刊发行量，早点把报刊送到群众手里，我学习愚公移山的精神，决定把班期再缩短一些，我试验着把五天的道并成四天走，后来又并成三天走。开始很累，时间长了就练出来了。群众管我叫“飞毛腿”、“准时钟”。同时，我又大力向群众宣传订阅报刊的好处，组织各单位订阅报刊。山里有九个生产单位，连一份报纸也没有。我就向这些单位的领导提意见说：“工人成年在山里劳动，不看报思想就得上锈，你们应当给他们订几份报纸。”他们回答说：“你的意见很好，我们今天晚上就研究。”第二天这九个单位都订了一份报纸。我负责的邮区，经过宣传介绍，一九六三年底，报刊发行量增加到三百多份，现在已经发行七十多种，一千七百多份。订阅份数比我刚接手时增加了四十六倍。我的邮区现在平均不到三个人就有一份报纸或刊物。随着报刊发行量的增加，我的负担也随着加重了。我想为人民服务，首先就应该想到人民，想到革命，自己虽然累点，但当我看到报纸发挥作用时，感到无限的愉快。
    报刊发的多了，送的也快了。我认为做乡邮员，不仅要把报纸准确及时地送到群众的手里，而且要在群众中做好宣传。为了做到这一点，一九六五年以来，我在分拣报纸的时候，或在路上休息的时候，就把报纸的主要内容看一遍。在投递的时候，先告诉社员报上有什么大事。农忙的时候，我就把报纸送到地里，赶上歇晌，我就给大家念一段。
    原先我认为，自己不嫌担子重，不怕吃苦不怕累，就已经是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务了。但当我学了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》以后，用毛主席说的“……一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。”按照这句话一检查，才认识到自己为人民服务得还不“完全”，不“彻底”。群众寄一封信还得走十几里甚至几十里路到邮电所或邮电局。从这以后，我就在出班时带着邮票和信封信纸，群众寄信我就给捎着。可是还有些群众叫我给代取代汇钱款，因为上级明文规定不准乡邮员代取代汇，我就向群众解释，但是群众还要求我来代办。后来，有的大队党支部书记代表群众要求说：“咱这里离县城远，去取点钱或汇点钱来回就得三四天，影响生产，群众又劳累，你就给办了吧。”这一下子才使我考虑到，订立规章制度是为了让我们更好地为人民服务，不是限制为人民服务，在我们这交通极不方便的地方，要从实际出发，从群众的要求出发，执行制度也得因地制宜。我把这种想法和局长谈了，局长也同意我的看法。为了方便群众，不影响生产，在群众的要求下，我三年多来为群众代取代汇钱款三万多元，没出一次差错，群众很满意。从这件事里使我又认识到，为人民服务是无限的。此后凡是群众提出要求，我能办到的，就都尽力去办。比如，有人托我给买药，有的妇女生孩子叫我给捎鸡蛋，等等，我都按群众的要求办到了。
    几年来，我从毛主席的书中找到了革命的方向，找到了无穷的力量。我在工作中所取得的成绩，也就是遵照毛主席的教导的结果。今后我一定要加倍努力学习毛主席著作，力争把工作做得更好。（附图片）
