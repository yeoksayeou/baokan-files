    The Importance of Putting Mao Zedong Thought in Command as Seen from Two Designs
    Establishing a "For the People" Ideology: A river dredging project benefits both municipal construction and agricultural development.
    Lacking a "For the People" Ideology: A highway construction project unnecessarily occupies farmland and inconveniences the masses.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) A comparison of two construction designs in Beijing vividly demonstrates that whether or not Mao Zedong Thought is put in command is a major issue affecting the success or failure of work and the quality of its results.
    These two projects are the dredging of the South Moat outside Beijing and the construction of a highway in the suburbs. The construction design for one project highlighted politics and considered everything "for the people," receiving praise from the peasants. The other project did not highlight politics and lacked a "for the people" ideology, turning a good thing into a bad one, and received criticism from the peasants.
    The initial design plan for the South Moat dredging project was made by the designers according to the so-called "economic" and "on-site soil disposal" methods that had been used in the past for ease of construction. According to this plan, 1,400 mu of farmland, mostly the best vegetable land, would be occupied; at the same time, more than 2,600 houses along the river would have to be demolished. This would not only affect the production of some production teams and the lives of the peasants along the river, but also affect the timely progress of the project because of the large amount of land occupation and housing demolition, which would need to be properly handled.
    What to do? Under the leadership of the project headquarters, the design, construction, and housing management personnel participating in the project conducted a discussion in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of serving the people. Through discussion, they further clarified that in the construction design of this project, it is necessary to implement the "two-pronged" ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people and having a global perspective, and to try every means to occupy less farmland and demolish fewer houses.
    With Mao Zedong Thought in command, they had the determination to be revolutionary. They broke the old framework of construction design, adopted the method of combining designers, constructors, and managers, and combined internal and external efforts by relying on the masses, humbly listening to the opinions of the peasants, and re-designing the construction of this project. Under the personal leadership of the person in charge of the project headquarters, personnel from design, construction, housing management, and other aspects, as well as some cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants from more than a dozen production teams in the three communes along the river, were organized to conduct multiple investigations and visits along the river. Many peasants from nearby production teams suggested that the soil excavated from dredging the river could be used to fill barren and low-lying land, which would not only reduce the occupation of farmland and demolition of houses, but also help support the production team's farmland construction. After careful study, they gladly accepted the peasants' opinions and acted according to the peasants' requests, re-designing the construction plan. Compared with the original plan, the new plan not only occupies more than 400 mu less farmland and demolishes more than 1,100 fewer houses, but also saves the country more than one million yuan in investment. At the same time, the soil excavated from dredging the river can be used to fill more than 1,000 mu of barren and low-lying land, which the peasants call "flooding even when the toad urinates," turning it into fertile land. In this way, the occupied farmland and the filled barren and low-lying land offset each other, and the farmland of the nearby production teams is expanded.
    Now, they are constructing according to the new plan, combining this municipal construction with support for the farmland construction of nearby production teams very well. So far, they have filled more than 450 mu of barren and low-lying land. The peasants praised them for turning barren and low-lying land into fertile land, truly thinking well for the people, and benefiting future generations. During the construction, the peasant masses also enthusiastically helped pave roads and assisted in solving the lighting problems for night transportation. Some people voluntarily brought tea and water to the construction workers.
    However, the construction design of a section of another highway was the opposite. The construction designers did not establish the "for the people" ideology well, nor did they conduct sufficient investigation and research. This highway passes near a village of more than forty households, occupying more than 90 mu of the village's only 180 mu of farmland, and destroying more than 4,000 fruit trees. Originally, it was a good thing for this highway to pass through this village, as it could use this highway to strengthen its connection with the outside world and promote production development. However, because the designers of this highway simply considered technical aspects such as "short, straight, and gentle slope" in the highway design, and did not think well from the perspective of the masses' interests, they chose the route on the high slope above this village, making it difficult for this village and other nearby villages to use this highway, and the cost is also higher. In this way, they turned a good thing into a bad thing, and received criticism from the peasants.
    Now, the designers of this highway have learned a lesson from the construction design, and have recently conducted actual surveys near that village again, and have humbly listened to the criticisms and opinions of the peasants. They are prepared to clear out the land occupied by the construction sheds and the placement of stones and return it to the peasants after the completion of the construction task. At the same time, they plan to take advantage of the convenience of construction to help that village change some of its dry land into irrigated land. The access roads used in the construction are also planned to be connected to the village so that the village can use the newly built highway.

### 从两项设计中看毛泽东思想挂帅的重要性

    从两项设计中看毛泽东思想挂帅的重要性
    树立“为人民”的思想，一条河道的疏浚工程，既利市政建设，又利农田建设
    缺乏“为人民”的思想，一条公路的建设工程，既多占用农田，又不方便群众
    据新华社讯　从北京市两项施工设计的对比中，可以鲜明地看清是不是用毛泽东思想挂帅，是关系着工作成败和效果好坏的大问题。
    这两项工程，一是北京城外的南护城河疏浚工程，一是郊区的一条公路建设。这两项工程的施工设计，一个突出了政治，处处“为人民”着想，受到了农民的赞扬；一个没有突出政治，缺乏“为人民”的思想，把好事办成坏事，受到了农民的批评。
    南护城河疏浚工程的设计人员起初设计的方案，是按过去惯用的所谓“经济”和施工方便的“就地弃土”的办法作出来的。依照这个方案施工，就要占农田一千四百亩，而且大部分又是最好的菜地；同时，还要拆除河道两旁房屋两千六百多间。这不但要影响河道两旁的一些生产队的生产和农民群众的生活，而且由于占地多、房屋拆迁多，需要妥善处理，还影响工程不能如期进行。
    怎么办？在工程指挥部的领导下，参加这项工程的设计、施工和房屋管理人员，按照毛主席提出的为人民服务的教导，进行了一场讨论。通过讨论，他们进一步明确了在这项工程的施工设计中，必须贯彻全心全意为人民服务和全局观点的“两全”思想，千方百计少占农田、少拆房屋。
    毛泽东思想挂了帅，他们就有了勇于革命的决心。他们打破了施工设计的老框框，采取设计、施工、管理人员三结合和依靠群众内外结合的办法，虚心听取农民的意见，重新进行了这项工程的施工设计。在工程指挥部负责人的亲自带领下，先后组织了设计、施工和房屋管理等方面的人员，以及河道两旁三个公社的十多个生产队的一些干部和贫下中农，沿着河道进行了多次的调查和访问。附近生产队的很多农民向他们提出，可以用疏浚河道挖出的土填垫荒洼地，这样既可少占农田，少拆房子，也有利于支援生产队的农田建设。他们经过认真研究后，欣然采纳了农民的意见，按照农民的要求办事，重新设计了施工方案。新的方案与原来的方案相比，不仅少占农田四百多亩，少拆房屋一千一百多间，并且还为国家节约投资一百多万元。同时，用疏浚河道挖出来的土方，可以把农民称为“蛤蟆撒尿就涝”的一千多亩荒洼地填垫成良田。这样，所占的农田和填垫的荒洼地相抵，还使附近生产队的农田扩大了。
    现在，他们正在按照新的方案施工，把这项市政建设和支援附近生产队的农田建设很好地结合了起来。到目前为止，他们已经填垫荒洼地四百五十多亩。农民赞扬他们把荒洼地变成良田，真是为人民想得好，使子孙后代都受益。在施工中，农民群众还热情地帮助垫路，并且协助解决夜间运输的照明等问题。有些群众自动给施工人员送茶送水。
    而另一条公路的一段施工设计，恰恰相反。施工设计人员没有很好地树立“为人民”的思想，没有很好地进行调查研究。这条公路从一个四十多户人家的村庄附近经过，把这个村庄仅有的一百八十多亩农田占用了九十多亩，损失果树四千多棵。本来这条公路途经这个村庄是件好事，可以利用这条公路加强同外边的联系，来促进生产发展。但是由于这条公路的设计人员，单纯地从公路设计的“近、直和坡度小”等技术上考虑，没有很好地从群众利益着想，把线路选择在这个村子上面的高坡上，使这个村庄和附近其他村庄，想利用这条公路也很困难，而且造价也较高。这样，他们就把好事办成了坏事，受到了农民的批评。
    现在，这条公路的设计人员从施工设计中吸取了教训，最近又到那个村子的附近重新进行了实际勘测，并且虚心听取了农民的批评和意见。他们准备将施工的工棚和放石头占用的一部分土地，在完成施工任务之后清理出退给农民。同时，准备利用施工的方便帮助那个村子改一部分旱地为水浇地。在施工中使用的便道，也准备修通到村庄，好让那个村子能够利用上新修的公路。
