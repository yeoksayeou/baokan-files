    "Red Crag" Inspires the Japanese People's Courage to Struggle
    Tokyo Audiences Praise Revolutionary Drama Adapted from Chinese Novel
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo - The drama "Red Crag," adapted from the famous Chinese novel, has been warmly welcomed by Japanese audiences. It was performed twenty times from November 16th to December 3rd, with an audience of 21,000 people.
    The person in charge of the Tokyo Art Theatre Troupe, which performed the drama, said that it is rare in Japan for a play to attract so many viewers. The attendance rate of "Red Crag" was twice as high as the troupe's previously most popular drama, "River Without Bridges."
    The person in charge of the troupe also said that viewers who saw "Red Crag" generally reflected that "Red Crag" gave them great encouragement and increased their courage to live and struggle. The actors also gained more confidence in performing revolutionary dramas due to receiving a warmer welcome than expected.
    Viewers of "Red Crag" also actively participated in post-viewing discussion meetings. Some of these discussion meetings were organized by the "Japan Workers' Theatre Council," and some were organized by viewers within their workplaces. According to preliminary statistics, a total of fifty to sixty such discussion meetings were held.
    In order to meet the strong demands of the vast audience, the Tokyo Art Theatre has decided to perform "Red Crag" again in Tokyo in July and August next year, and also plans to hold a tour in some major cities in Japan.

    《红岩》鼓舞了日本人民的斗争勇气
    东京观众赞赏根据我国小说改编的革命戏
    新华社东京电  根据中国著名长篇小说改编的话剧《红岩》受到了日本观众的热烈欢迎，从十一月十六日到十二月三日共演了二十场，观众达到两万一千人。
    演出这出话剧的东京艺术座剧团的负责人发表谈话说，一出戏能够吸引这么多的观众，在日本是罕见的。《红岩》演出的上座率比这个剧团过去演出上座率最高的话剧《没有桥梁的河》还多一倍。
    剧团的负责人还说，看了《红岩》的观众普遍反映，“《红岩》给了他们以极大的鼓舞，增加了他们生活和斗争的勇气。演员们也由于获得了超过预期的热烈欢迎，增强了演革命戏的信心。
    《红岩》的观众还积极参加了观后感的讨论会。这些讨论会有的是由“日本勤劳者演剧协议会”组织的，有的是由观众在工作单位内组织的。据初步统计，这种讨论会一共举行了五六十次。
    为了满足广大观众的强烈要求，东京艺术座决定明年七、八月间再次在东京演出《红岩》，还准备到日本的一些主要城市举行巡回演出。
