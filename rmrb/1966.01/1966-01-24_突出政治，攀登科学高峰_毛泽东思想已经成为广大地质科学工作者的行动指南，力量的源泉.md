    Emphasize Politics, Scale the Heights of Science
    Mao Zedong Thought Has Become the Action Guide and Source of Strength for the Broad Masses of Geological Science Workers

    Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the whole country are starting businesses through arduous effort, striving for progress, overcoming numerous difficulties, and creating brilliant achievements on all fronts of socialist construction. Our country's geological science workers, filled with revolutionary heroic aspirations and bearing the hopes of the people, are crossing great rivers, climbing high mountains, and fighting tensely for the development of our motherland's rich underground resources and the construction of vast projects. Mao Zedong Thought has become the guide to action and the source of strength for the broad masses of geological science workers. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we are even more confident and full of fighting spirit about the prospects of the revolution.

    The excellent situation of our country's revolution and construction requires us to solve geological science problems as quickly as possible, catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels rapidly, and in the struggle to overthrow imperialism and liberate the world's oppressed people, and in changing our country's poor and blank state, give the greatest effect to geological science. This is an important strategic task for our country's geological science workers. To achieve this task, the first thing is to emphasize politics, establish the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly, and apply Mao Zedong Thought to practical activities at all times, in all matters, and in all places, breaking the shackles of all kinds of frameworks. The era of imperialist rule over us is gone forever, but imperialism and modern revisionism still vainly attempt to control us in academic thought and block us in knowledge. We must break through it, take our own path, dare to think and create, and forge a Daqing and Dazhai on the scientific and technological front.

    Mao Zedong Thought is a guiding light for scaling the heights of world science, enabling us to dare to struggle, dare to practice, and dare to win. Therefore, in research work, we can pay attention to using the viewpoint of dividing one into two, investigating and studying, boldly participating in revolutionary practice, constantly accumulating a large number of facts, correctly understanding the essence of material movement, overcoming the influence of foreign frameworks, clearing away various pessimistic arguments that "certain rocks in China do not contain minerals" and "certain metallogenic eras in China have no hope," and putting forward new theories that conform to actual conditions, opening up broad prospects for the search for these minerals. Thus, several utilizable resources were identified for special elements needed by emerging cutting-edge industries, some of which are rare in the world; at the same time, single deposits have become bases for comprehensive utilization of multiple metals; some mineral raw materials that could not be utilized in the past are now put into industrial production. And these are things that imperialist and modern revisionist experts once thought impossible. Objective facts slapped the faces of bourgeois gentlemen. Through continuous study and summarization, we have increasingly realized the great material strength generated after Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses.

    Practice has proved that scientific research must serve proletarian politics and socialist construction. Wherever there is a problem, go there. Dare to tackle tough problems and actively undertake urgent, important, and tasks without ready-made experience, make progress, make creations, and make inventions in the process of completing tasks; it is also necessary to constantly summarize production problems and elevate them to theory, understanding, and mastering the laws of nature. For example, through the analysis and identification of ore minerals, summarize the theory of elemental coexistence and mineral paragenesis, and in turn, guide the work. In this way, from point to surface, from this to that, it is possible to put ores that cannot be utilized in foreign countries into production in our country, and it can be affirmed that more valuable mining areas can be found to fill the missing mineral species. This in scientific research not only surpasses the stage of blindly imitating and applying foreign frameworks, but also explores the way to creatively solve practical problems, and with the completion of production tasks, a new situation has been opened up for our country's geology, driving the creation of new technologies and new methods. As a result of doing this, the work is indeed becoming more and more lively, the path is becoming wider and wider, and the level is getting higher and higher, opening up the road to catching up with and surpassing the world level.

    To carry out scientific research in conjunction with production problems means that understanding depends on social practice, and its focus should be placed on the issue of developing socialist productivity and serving the people. To remove obstacles to production on the scientific research front and realize catching up with and surpassing the world's scientific and technological level is like annihilating the enemy's vital strength in the military. It does not lie in occupying a discipline or a construction site, but in accurately grasping the problem and doing it to the end, that is, it is better to break one finger of the enemy than to injure all ten fingers. Therefore, from production problems to basic theoretical problems and exploratory experimental problems, a revolutionary stand and worldview, and a dialectical materialist methodology are required. In this way, science can exert its due power on the front of transforming nature in a manner that is more, faster, better and more economical.

    The third five-year plan has begun. During the third five-year plan, geological scientific research work must make the greatest efforts to further develop the national economy, improve people's living standards, and strengthen national defense capabilities. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, let us strengthen the transformation of the subjective world, muster revolutionary vigor, mobilize all positive factors, implement the three-way combination of leaders, experts, and the masses, work hard, take our own path, and catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level as soon as possible.

    突出政治，攀登科学高峰
    毛泽东思想已经成为广大地质科学工作者的行动指南，力量的源泉
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全国人民艰苦创业，奋发图强，战胜了重重困难，在社会主义建设的各条战线上都创造了光辉的业绩。我国地质科学工作者，满怀革命的豪情壮志，肩负着人民的希望，跨大河、攀高山，为开发祖国丰富的地下资源和建设庞大的工程，紧张地奋战着。毛泽东思想已经成为广大地质科学工作者行动的指南，力量的源泉。回顾过去，展望将来，对革命的前景更是信心百倍，斗志昂扬。
    我国革命和建设的大好形势，要求我们尽快地解决地质科学问题，迅速赶上和超过世界先进水平，在打倒帝国主义，解放世界被压迫人民的斗争中，在改变我国一穷二白的面貌中，使地质科学发挥最大的效用。这是我国地质科学工作者的重要战略任务。要实现这个任务，首先是突出政治，树立全心全意为人民服务的观点，时时、事事、处处把毛泽东思想运用到实践活动中去，打破各式各样框框的束缚。帝国主义统治我们的时代一去不复返了，但是帝国主义和现代修正主义还妄想在学术思想上控制我们，在知识上封锁我们，必须打破它，走我们自己的路，敢想敢创，闯出科学技术战线上的大庆和大寨来。
    毛泽东思想是攀登世界科学高峰的指路明灯，使我们敢于斗争，敢于实践，敢于胜利。因此，在研究工作中，能够注意运用一分为二的观点，调查研究，勇于参加革命的实践，不断积累大量的事实，正确认识物质运动的本质，克服洋框框的影响，清除了认为“中国的某种岩石不含矿”、“中国的某些成矿时代没有希望”的各种悲观论点，提出了符合实际情况的新理论，为这些矿产的寻找打开了广阔的前景。从而给新兴尖端工业需要的特种元素，确定了若干可以利用的资源，有些是世界罕见的；同时使单一的矿床成了多种金属综合利用的基地；一些过去不能利用的矿物原料，现在已经投用在工业生产上。而这些却是帝国主义和现代修正主义专家们曾认为是不可能的事，客观事实打了资产阶级老爷们的嘴巴。通过不断的学习、总结，使我们愈发体会到毛泽东思想被群众掌握以后产生的巨大物质力量。
    实践证明，科学研究必须为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务，哪里有问题就往哪里去，要敢于啃硬骨头，积极承担那些紧急、重要和没有现成经验的任务，在完成任务的过程中有所进步，有所创造，有所发明；还要把生产问题不断总结，上升为理论，认识和掌握自然的规律性。如通过矿石矿物的分析鉴定，总结出元素共存和矿物共生的理论，反过来指导工作。这样由点到面，由此及彼，就可以使外国不能利用的矿石在我国可以投入生产，并且可肯定更多的有价值的矿区，填补缺少的矿种。这在科学研究上不仅超越了比着葫芦画瓢，套洋框框的阶段，摸索到创造性地解决实际问题的门路，而且，随着生产任务的完成，为我国的地质学打开了一个新的局面，带动了新技术、新方法的创立。这样作的结果，确实是工作越作越活，路子越走越宽，水平越来越高，打开了赶超世界水平的道路。
    结合生产问题作科学研究，就是说认识依赖于社会实践，其着眼点需放在发展社会主义生产力和为人民服务这个问题上。在科研战线上拔除阻碍生产的环节、实现赶超世界科学技术水平，同军事上消灭敌人有生力量一样，不在于占领一个学科、一个工地，而在于抓准问题干到底，也就是对敌人伤其十指不如断其一指。因此，从生产问题到基础理论问题和探索实验问题，都需要有革命的立场和世界观，辩证唯物主义的方法论。这样才能使科学多、快、好、省地在改造自然的战线上发挥应有的威力。
    第三个五年计划开始了，地质科学研究工作必须在第三个五年计划期间，为进一步发展国民经济，提高人民生活水平和加强国防力量上尽最大努力。让我们在毛泽东思想的指导下，加强主观世界的改造，鼓足革命干劲，调动一切积极因素，实行领导专家群众三结合，艰苦奋斗，走自己的路，尽快赶上和超过世界先进水平。
