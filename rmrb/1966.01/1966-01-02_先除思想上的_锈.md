    First Remove the "Rust" in Thought
    In the chemical laboratory of the Technical Section of the Daqing General Machine Factory, a balance scale had rusted, which somewhat affected its accuracy. Some people advocated removing the rust, while others opposed it. The reason for the opposition was: this kind of precision measuring instrument cannot be moved at all; once it is moved, its precision cannot be restored. Therefore, the leadership guided everyone to study "On Practice" to break the superstition that the balance scale could not be moved. Everyone's thinking was raised, methods were created, the rust on the balance scale was removed, and the precision of the balance scale was even higher. The operator of the balance scale said with deep feeling: "Frequently studying Chairman Mao's works, and first paying attention to removing the rust in thought, will prevent the balance scale from rusting again."
    This experience illustrates a truth: only with good thinking can work be good, and production be good. To remove the various "rusts" in work and production, we must first remove the various "rusts" in thought. And Chairman Mao's works are the best "rust remover."

    先除思想上的“锈”
    大庆总机厂技术科化验室有一架天平生了锈，多少影响到它的准确性。有人主张除锈，有人反对除锈，反对的理由是：这种精密的量具，根本不能动，动了就不能恢复它的精度。于是，领导上就引导大家学习《实践论》，破除天平不能动的迷信。大家的思想提高了，办法产生了，天平上的锈除掉了，天平的精度也更高了。天平的操作者深有体会地说：“经常学习毛主席的著作，首先注意清除思想上的锈，天平就不会再生锈了。”
    这个体会说明一个真理：只有思想好，工作才能好，生产才能好。要清除工作上和生产上的各种“锈”，首先就要清除思想上的各种“锈”。而毛主席著作就是最好的“除锈剂”。
