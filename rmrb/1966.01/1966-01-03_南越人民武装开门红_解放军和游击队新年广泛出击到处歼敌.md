    Editor's Note: The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation has entered a new year. On New Year's Day, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces launched widespread offensives and achieved victories by annihilating the enemy, opening a new chapter of victory with new battles and new achievements. This demonstrates the Vietnamese people's firm will to drive out the American aggressors, and heralds that the new year will be a year of greater victories for the Vietnamese people. At a time when American imperialism is desperately spreading "peace" smoke screens in order to cover up its conspiracy to expand the war, the battle horns sounded by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces from the Mekong Delta and the Central Highlands are like thunder and lightning, breaking through the noisy clamor. No matter how vicious American imperialism is, no matter how it plays tricks, the Vietnamese people will advance towards complete victory with firm steps.
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Saigon dispatch: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas continued to widely attack the enemy as the New Year arrived. According to Western news agencies, southwest of Saigon about 136 kilometers, the Liberation Armed Forces on the first of January afternoon fiercely attacked the stationed South Vietnamese puppet army. The battle began at 3:30 in the afternoon and continued late into the night. A puppet "military spokesman" admitted that "fierce fighting caused heavy casualties to the (puppet) government troops."
    On the evening of the first, the Liberation Armed Forces also attacked a puppet army stronghold about nine kilometers northwest of Kontum in the Central Highlands, causing casualties to the garrison. In addition, an enemy airfield south of Tuy Hoa was also shelled by the Liberation Armed Forces with mortars on the evening of the first.
    After dawn on the second, news of the Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas victoriously striking the enemy spread from various locations. It was reported that in Phu Yen Province, about 350 kilometers northeast of Saigon, guerrillas ambushed a South Korean accomplice army and South Vietnamese puppet army at dawn, causing casualties and losses to the enemy. Eight kilometers north of Quang Ngai, the Liberation Armed Forces captured and burned a puppet army stronghold in the early morning, and the defending enemy fled in disarray.

    南越人民武装开门红
    解放军和游击队新年广泛出击到处歼敌
    编者按　越南人民抗美救国斗争进入新的一年。南越人民武装力量元旦广泛出击，歼敌致胜，以新的战斗和新的战果，揭开新胜利的序幕。它显示了越南人民决心赶走美国侵略者的坚强意志，预示着新的一年将是越南人民取得更大胜利的一年。在这美帝国主义为了掩盖扩大战争阴谋而拼命散布“和平”烟幕的时候，南越人民武装从湄公河三角洲和中部高原发出的战斗号角，有如电闪雷鸣，冲破那些闹哄哄的喧嚣。不管美帝国主义怎样穷凶极恶，怎样玩弄阴谋，越南人民将以坚定的步伐向着完全的胜利前进。
    新华社二日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量和游击队在新的一年来临的时候继续广泛袭击敌人。据西方通讯社报道，在距离西贡西南一百三十六公里的地方，解放武装力量一日下午猛烈攻击驻守的南越伪军。战斗从下午三时半开始一直进行到深夜。一位伪“军事发言人”承认，“激烈的战斗使（伪）政府军遭到重大伤亡”。
    一日晚，解放武装力量还袭击了中部高原昆嵩西北约九公里的一个伪军据点，使守军遭到了伤亡。此外，绥和以南的一个敌军机场一日晚也遭到了解放武装力量迫击炮的轰击。
    二日凌晨以后，各地又传出了解放武装力量和游击队胜利打击敌人的消息。据报道，在距离西贡东北约三百五十公里的富安省，游击队在凌晨伏击了一支南朝鲜帮凶军和南越伪军，使敌人遭受伤亡和损失。在广义北面八公里的地方，解放武装力量在清晨攻占并烧毁了一个伪军据点，守敌狼狈逃窜。
