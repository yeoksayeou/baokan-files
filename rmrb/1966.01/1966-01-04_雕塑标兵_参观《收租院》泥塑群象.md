    Sculpture Vanguard
    ——Visiting the Clay Sculpture Group "Rent Collection Courtyard"
    Wang Chaowen
        New Flower Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Sichuan art workers used the art form of group sculpture to create more than a hundred life-size figures, turning the landlord Liu Wencai's Rent Collection Courtyard, a veritable gateway to hell for peasants in the old society, into a vivid classroom for political and ideological education. This is a new achievement of revolutionary literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and a great victory of the cultural revolution. Its emergence is adapted to the needs of revolutionary struggle and closely coordinated with the fundamental tasks of the current revolutionary struggle; it is a product of the great socialist education movement and a powerful tool for conducting socialist education among the masses. Facts once again show that as long as artists have a full of enthusiasm for serving the people, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, truly plunge into the midst of the worker, peasant, and soldier masses, and closely combine the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act with the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, it is possible to fully develop initiative and creativity and create good works that push out the old of capitalism and feudalism and bring forth the new of socialism and communism.
    Sculpture creation, like other literary and artistic works, must undergo a revolutionary transformation in its ideological content and artistic form to become an ideological weapon for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, transforming thinking, raising awareness, and enhancing fighting spirit. In order to fully reflect the contradiction and struggle between landlords and peasants, the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture authors focused on the important link of rent payment and collection in the relationship between peasants and landlords, and strived to make its form popular with the masses. They transformed and absorbed the dramatic group sculpture form in traditional sculpture art. This large-scale clay sculpture group, with its numerous figures, although not as emphasizing plot or the continuity of characters' actions and scenes as "comic strips," its interconnected scenes, varying in focus and size, are rich in perceptual characteristics and easy to understand in their reflection of life. This artistic style was used by the feudal ruling class in the old society. Today, in the hands of artists who are breaking the old and establishing the new, this artistic style has been reborn like the ancient opera art becoming revolutionary modern opera, transforming from a tool for麻醉群众麻zui qunzhong (numbing the masses) into a powerful weapon serving proletarian politics. In order to create a sense of realism, the authors broke through the "foreign frameworks" that did not conform to the masses' appreciation habits and requirements, using glass balls as pupils. In order to create a sense of realism, the authors combined the pillars and doors of the Rent Collection Courtyard scene with the characters and plot. In order to create a sense of realism, the authors tried to make each character and action individualized, avoiding the formulaic nature of specimen models. In order to make the work more politically powerful, the authors also rejected the kind of realism that might be surprising but meaningless. The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture, which so easily reflects class contradictions and struggles in a way that is easy to understand and thought-provoking, is a creative move in art creation with exemplary significance and worthy of promotion. Relatively speaking, it is a vanguard, a model.
    The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture depicts the tenants painfully delivering "iron-clad rent" to the landlord, the landlord and his lackeys fraudulently, viciously, barbarously, and shamelessly inspecting rent, using the "over-斗" (over-measuring) method, and calculating accounts, and the tenants who could not pay enough rent being forced to sell their children, leading to the destruction of their families, demonstrating a contradiction and struggle between exploitation and being exploited, oppression and resistance, and showing the process of peasants from unawareness to awareness. These images are very typical, very moving, and very educational. For example, in the "accounting" section, Liu Wencai, this "living閻王 yanwang" (阎王 is translated to King of Hell, but here is used as a metonym for a cruel, pitiless person), this devil who combined the roles of warlord, bureaucrat, local tyrant, evil gentry, and head of a reactionary secret society, rack his brains and squeezed the peasants at will; but because where there is oppression there is resistance, he was surrounded by the hatred of the peasants. This plot and scene are both stimulating and full of ideological depth. It shows both the enemy's tyrannical side and the enemy's weak side; it shows both the peasant's suffering side and the peasant's resistance side. It is like an indictment of the feudal ruling class and a eulogy to the gradually awakened peasants who are marching towards struggle; it represents the people's merciless trial of the exploitative system, and at the same time represents the revolutionary will of the modern liberated people to never allow the man-eating system to be restored. Even a part of a fragment, because its image is real and vivid, it plays a role in enriching the whole in art. Like the arguments of a political essay, it plays a role in preventing the restoration of the man-eating exploitation system in thought. For example, that mother who is carrying and stroking her hungry child, and who is herself so hungry that she can hardly stand; she is both unwilling to immediately throw the grain soaked in blood and sweat into the tiger's mouth, and at the same time does not yet understand how to change this path of persecution; she seems to foresee more painful encounters coming, but also seems to be about to burst out an irrepressible accusation; her posture and expression, especially her dazed eyes, her mouth that seems to be panting, contains so much rich emotional content! How can this individualized and representative image not make people more and more excited? When those local peasants who had been deeply persecuted saw the reproduction of the hell on earth where "paying rent is like climbing a mountain of knives, and one关guan (关is translated to barrier, but here is used as a metonym for difficulty) is more difficult than the other," and saw groups of real and vivid, heart-stirring images, how could they not evoke corresponding memories and experiences, arouse strong class feelings of hatred for the exploitative system, and more strongly love the new socialist system?
      The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture is not only a new flower of sculpture serving the countryside, but also a milestone in the advancement of revolutionary sculpture. Since the liberation of the whole country, many excellent sculpture works have been produced in our country, but the needs of the masses are constantly developing and improving, so the problem of how to adapt to the new requirements of the masses in creation needs to be further solved. In the past, because sculptors were not closely integrated with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, some works, although vividly recording the phenomena of life, were not closely combined with the major events of the country and the major events of the people, lacking the characteristics of the era and class generalization. Although some works also attempted to reflect major events in reality, unfortunately they lacked individualized life basis, had not yet conceived creative themes, and failed to create vivid and exciting images. The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture not only develops the excellent traditions of revolutionary sculpture, but also overcomes the shortcomings of the insufficient close combination of thought and art. Here, one rarely sees modeling that uses material to replace creation and lacks social significance, merely recording trivial phenomena; one also rarely sees pretentious modeling that is empty in content and lacks realism; most of them have clear ideological tendencies and perfect artistic forms, conforming to the aesthetic tastes of the masses. Whether it is the old man who is trembling with anger, holding a handful of grain, and arguing with the vicious lackey, saying "This is good grain," or the mother and daughter who are facing the landlord's man-eating斗dou (斗 is a Chinese unit of dry volume, approximately equal to 10 liters but here it is used as a metonym for exploitation), carrying a basket of grain that seems to weigh a thousand catties; whether it is the woman who is holding the rope of the basket as if holding a weapon, or the old man who is facing the big 斗dou (斗 is a Chinese unit of dry volume, approximately equal to 10 liters but here it is used as a metonym for exploitation) with its blood basin-like mouth; they are all images intertwined with pain and hatred, and are all the author's solemn criticism of the exploiting class. It is precisely because these artistic images have outstanding political significance that it guarantees that this set of works can exert a powerful force in political and ideological education.
    Sculpture, as a tool for political and ideological education, must have the following basic characteristics: the good and beautiful objects and the evil and ugly objects reflected by the modeling must appear easier to recognize than actual life itself. Only by shaping the spiritual outlook of various characters so that they are easier to recognize can the image have a clear class tendency and historical specificity. The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture is precisely a good work with this clear political tendency. It does not deviate from the sense of reality and typicality of the characters and plot, and its tendency is not arbitrarily attached outside the modeling. Therefore, it conforms to Chairman Mao's instruction:
  "The unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible." Starting from a specific theme, these clay sculptures creatively embody the political purpose of revolutionary literature and art that Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: literature and art concentrate the everyday phenomenon of man exploiting man and man oppressing man, which people see as very ordinary and existing everywhere, typify the contradictions and struggles in it, thereby producing the great effect of "awakening the masses, inspiring them, and promoting them to unite and struggle to transform their own environment."
        The Result of Ideological Revolutionization
      The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture has achieved such great achievements because the creators correctly implemented the line of "from the masses, to the masses" put forward by Chairman Mao. They often studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, grasped the guiding ideology for correctly handling the theme; often listened to the opinions of the masses, studied the reactions of the masses, and more deeply understood the needs of the masses; thereby continuously improving the modeling design. If there were no rich indirect life experience from the masses, if there were no deep understanding of reality from the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, it would be difficult to skillfully combine folk art knowledge with new creative tasks, to make a reflection of the crimes of the landlord class and the resistance of the peasants that is both particular and general, and to typically generalize the suffering and struggle of millions of peasants for thousands of years.
    This is very important: it is precisely because the authors accepted the revolutionary ideals of the proletariat, had the political sense of responsibility of spokespersons for the revolutionary masses, and were able to understand reality from the ideological height of today, that even though the work reflects the tragic encounters of the masses in the old society, it can also show the spirit of the times, can be accepted by the masses, and has not lost the educational and inspiring role that revolutionary art should have. At the same time, it is precisely because their ideals have not deviated from the particularity of the masses' struggle experience and the specificity of their life encounters that the shortcomings of modeling flowing into exaggeration and falseness can be avoided. Look: that middle-aged peasant who is standing next to his empty basket, bare-chested, clenching his fists, full of dynamics in statics, and whose back and arms constitute a powerful sense of form of an arc, even the muscles seem to be boiling with strong class hatred, is not he a vivid portrayal of a resister who lives in suffering, but does not allow the arrangement of fate? This resistance is of course relatively simple, but it precisely conforms to the level of awareness of this character. Hatred, as the dominant characteristic of this character's psychological phenomenon, appears simultaneously with his subordinate characteristic of psychological phenomenon—pain. Also because the dominant psychological phenomenon—hatred—has been prominently expressed, the character of this character is distinct. Chairman Mao taught us: "The people, only the people, are the driving force in creating history." The clay sculpture authors relied on the people, gradually enriched their indirect life experience and direct life experience, gradually clarified how to better reflect this class struggle, and gradually strengthened their class feelings. They were mass-oriented in life and thought, and could express the masses and represent the masses in creation. Relying on the masses appropriately brought out the unique expressiveness of modeling art, shockingly and thought-provokingly reproducing this cruel class struggle.
    Even if we look at the images in a very secondary position, we can see that the tendency of this set of clay sculptures is very clear and the realism is very strong. For example, the image of the widow who is wearing mourning clothes, holding her arms, opening her clothes, leaning against the pillar, sitting on an empty back basket, leading her child, seemingly thinking, and seemingly observing, is very expressive. Of course, how this widow's husband was forced to death by the landlord, how sad she was when her relatives were forced to death, and how the predicament of not having money to bury her relatives tormented her, all of this has not been (and does not need to be) directly explained in this form. However, relying on the suggestive effect of instantaneous phenomenon descriptions, it is possible to make people associate with many intolerable encounters she has experienced. This woman has thrown the only life-saving rations into the greedy tiger's mouth, leaving only an empty back basket that can be used as a stool to sit on, facing the "accounting"关guan (关is translated to barrier, but here is used as a metonym for difficulty) that is more difficult than the "over-measuring"关guan (关is translated to barrier, but here is used as a metonym for difficulty), foreseeing the more unfortunate future of her child and the whole family. This woman has not shouted a strong protest like others, and is not holding a machine that she wants to use to strike the enemy like others, but she is also holding back a belly full of anger. This kind of modeling, which starts from actual life, combines pain and hatred, does not fall into clichés in its form of expression, and does not have monotonous specific content, not only plays a role in enriching the whole of the group image like other parts, but also has relative independence and completeness in itself. This is a concrete manifestation of the author starting from reality and avoiding one-sidedness and superficiality in understanding. Let's look again at the image of the woman who has gone through heavy exploitation, was injured by the landlord in the conflict, and was finally locked up in a private prison, separated from her two children: she is fiercely accusing the enemy of oppression, but the author has not unilaterally emphasized her hatred and erased her pain. Like the young man mentioned above who is clenching his fists, although she has not yet found her own revolutionary path to save herself at this moment, she is obviously not an numb bystander, not a颓丧 tuisang (spiritless) loser, and not a confused and fearful person to the exploitation and oppression of the class enemy, but a resister who cannot hold back a belly full of anger and has issued a strong accusation. This woman who has already burst out a strong protest is very different from the above-mentioned image of the woman whose mourning cloth even seems to be full of subtext. This difference is a manifestation of the difference in the character's situation, personality, and level of awareness. As a part of the whole, in the group image reflecting class struggle, these very specific parts are all powerful basis for embodying the revolutionary political tendency. As long as we do not look at the parts in the whole in isolation, as long as we do not require a certain character to replace everything, then these individualized modeling will become an indispensable and complementary component in the whole of the group image.
    These images in the "Rent Collection Courtyard" show that the suffering of the peasants is the product of class oppression, and the hatred of the peasants is also the product of class oppression. The emergence of these images, which focus on and harmoniously express class suffering and class hatred together, is the result of the author grasping the correct creative method, making correct judgments on the thoughts, emotions, will, and psychological characteristics of these oppressed peasants, and eliminating the destructive effect of metaphysics on creative activities. We see: whether it is the girl who is really unwilling to let the landlord's windmill swallow the grain, swallowing her tears into her stomach, but having to tiptoe to pour the grain into the windmill; or the wet nurse who is dragged away to抵租 dizu (exchange for rent) and cannot break free from the enemy's clutches, but is still concerned about the motherless baby; whether it is the old man who is facing the difficulty of accounting and is uselessly counting the bamboo sticks symbolizing grain; or the young man who is facing the hell on earth and cannot suppress his anger of revenge, determined to bury the man-eating social system, and is about to follow his uncles and uncles to join the guerrillas; these images that fit the characteristics of different levels of awareness, different personalities, and different conditions, are both rich and simple in their depiction of the characters' spiritual outlook. From the perspective of creative methods, the generation of the multifaceted and complete nature of the characters' emotional content and the overcoming of the simplification and superficialization of the characters' actions and expressions are mainly not the improvement of artistic skills, but mainly the result of starting from reality and dialectically treating the object of reflection.
    In the creative process, the relationship between the guiding ideology of creation and the theme of the work is as follows: when an artist faces rich and complex material, if there is no class viewpoint as the ideological guidance of creative activities, it is difficult for him to avoid the blindness of creative activities. At the same time, correct guiding ideology can only create good works with a good and creative combination of theme and image by combining with specific materials. And this point is also very important: the cognitive process of the creative process is also the transformation process of the author's subjective world. The knowledge of life in the old society that the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture authors gradually enriched by relying on the masses has itself reflected class relations, so it not only plays a role in enriching the image and deepening the image, plays a role in enriching the theme and developing the theme, but also transforms the author's world outlook to a certain extent. The authors sometimes have tears on their faces when they are shaping; why is this? This is not only a manifestation of the author entering the role and being deeply moved by the suffering of the masses, but also a manifestation of transforming their own thoughts and having the feelings of the masses in the activity of creation, which is full of contradictions. It is precisely because of this that the authors have more strict requirements for their own labor, are unwilling to simply interpret class relations, do not satisfy with the easy-to-understand modeling, but strive to improve quality. It is precisely because of this that the clay sculpture authors have the conditions to correctly grasp the correct prompt from the leadership that "it is necessary to express the suffering of the people, but also to express the resistance of the people," and make it creatively embodied in the image. It is precisely because of this that the exemplary nature of the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture creative activity does not lie in letting others imitate these labor results in the same way, but in its correct use of dialectical materialism to understand reality, and in the realistic method, attitude, and style embodied in the creative process. That is to say: these good works that serve proletarian politics can only be the product of the authors persisting in self-transformation and improving their ideological level.
      New Starting Point for Moving Forward
    Artistic creation, as a reflection and understanding of reality, depends on how the author understands the needs of current political and ideological education work, and on whether the author's understanding of the life he wants to reflect is specific, in-depth, correct, and profound. Sculpture creation and artistic creation are the same. For example, in the painting "Blood and Tears of Child Labor," the injured spinning girl in the work is tearful in her mother's arms, but the image focuses on expressing not pain, but her hatred for the capitalists. This image, which is very moving in painting, clearly shows the painter's cognitive ability. The hero阿庆嫂 A Qingsao in the Peking Opera "Shajiabang" is both the teahouse owner and an underground party member. If the former is erased in the performance, it will lose the specificity of the environment in which the hero is located. If the latter is slightly weakened, it will only lead to the bad result of丑化英雄 chouhua yingxiong (丑化 means to defame, yingxiong means hero). The actors correctly understood the mutual dependence and opposition between these two characteristics, and only then completely shaped this noble hero who exists under specific conditions on the revolutionary stage. The many relatively mature images in the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture were also created by the authors understanding the essential characteristics of the peasants' social status and thoughts and feelings under specific conditions.
    Although world outlook cannot replace creative methods, it includes creative methods. The emergence of many excellent images in the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture is not only a manifestation of class analysis of the man-eating old society, but also a manifestation of correctly treating the distinctions and connections of various characteristics of objective things in understanding. The correct application of creative methods is not only conditioned by rich life experience and knowledge, but also by the authors correctly accepting the leadership of the party and the help of the masses in the creative process, and repeatedly and deeply understanding the objective world and gradually transforming their own subjective world. If they had not accepted the transformation of the world outlook, there would be no enthusiasm for all activities for the revolution, no revolutionary vigor of not being afraid of failure and daring to think and act, no serious attitude and strict requirements; they would not dare to boldly use the doors and pillars of the scene in the design, and would not carefully use these existing conditions that can be used. Then, they would not be able to resist traditional concepts and habitual forces, nor would they be able to appropriately absorb the successful experiences of others, appropriately accept the lessons of failed experiences, and enter a brand-new and more effective creative activity.
    It is precisely because the transformation of artistic thought and creative methods must go through a certain process, so even the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture, which has been widely praised by the audience, still has shortcomings that need to be overcome. The most striking thing is that the modeling of some negative characters has more or less inappropriate cartoonization, and some forms have also appeared that violate the stipulated situation and the interrelationship of characters. This is certainly not to say that art should not make the ugly things it reflects appear more hateful, but it is precisely in order to make it appear more hateful that in portraying the ugly faces of these lackeys who are attached to the evil landlord and commit crimes for despicable desires, it is necessary to conduct a deep excavation from the aspects of their spiritual qualities, avoid superficial depictions of external forms, and avoid exaggerations that do not meet the requirements of serious satire. The modeling of the lackey who is monitoring the peasants in the "sending rent" section, the modeling of the guard in the "逼租 bizu (逼zu is translated to force the rent)" section, and the modeling of the "風風匠 fengfengjiang (wind wind craftsman)" and "刮刮匠 guaguajiang (scratch scratch craftsman)," especially the lackey who is carrying a short gun, wearing slippers, with a狰狞zhengning (ferocious) face and a frivolous figure, this kind of modeling that combines the characteristics of hardness and softness, thereby generalizing his cold and cruel character, is not it both exaggerated and real in art? Unfortunately, the modeling of some other lackeys has the shortcomings of simplification and superficialization in revealing the ugly spiritual outlook of the characters. This fails to more ruthlessly make the "bullets" of art penetrate the enemy's "heart" mercilessly. Just as some positive characters (especially some young and middle-aged people) still need to be further processed in the depiction of personality and emotions, and there should be more changes in the expression of angry emotions, so that the image is more full and more resistant to viewing, and can better embody the creative theme, the modeling of this negative character still needs to be processed. We must highlight politics in creation and strictly treat the selection of artistic techniques under the political effect. Only by appropriately exerting the strengths of art to highlight politics can clay sculpture modeling truly become a sharp combat weapon. The necessity of artistic exaggeration lies in expressing the artist's clear right and wrong, strong love and hate. Only after fully observing, experiencing, researching, and analyzing social phenomena can the exaggeration techniques of shaping the image be applied appropriately. If we oppose exaggeration to simplicity, oppose clarity to depth, oppose the easy-to-understand external features to the deep description of the inner state, unilaterally emphasize the former and lose the latter, and make the former lose its reliable life basis, then it is difficult to say that the author has fully made a hard and therefore correct, deep, and unique analysis and judgment of the objective reality.
    Perfect works of art will never exist, and the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture is certainly not perfect. The number of authors is not large, and most of them are young people who lack life experience in the old society. It only took four and a half months from design to completion. It is impossible to ask for no shortcomings in these more than one hundred life-size statues (in addition, there are more than one hundred props). What's more, this batch of works is also prepared to continue processing. Whether these forms should be colored, whether to emphasize heavy color or light color, is still in the process of experimentation. Moreover, the above-mentioned shortcomings do not occupy a dominant position in the overall situation, and it does not cancel the basic achievements of this creative activity that is oriented to the countryside and serves politics quickly, well, and economically.
    The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture not only allows the audience to see the bloody reality of how the evil landlord Liu Wencai exploited the people, but also correspondingly expresses the revolutionary thought that the revolution must be carried out to the end. Isn't it? The audience wrote on the message board on the scene: "I finished watching this courtyard with tears in my eyes"; "I understand what to love and what to hate"; "I will never live up to the teachings of the Party"; "Resolutely carry out the struggle with the class enemy that will never stop"! The "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture not only has the role of educating the masses to raise vigilance and prevent the restoration of the exploiting class, but also plays an educational role in promoting people to break with all the old ideas, old concepts, old habits, and old tastes from big and small Liu Wencai and actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements. The emergence of the "Rent Collection Courtyard" work convincingly shows that group sculpture, an artistic style that is easily accepted by the masses, has a great role to play in many revolutionary struggles. It can be used to reflect the revolutionary history of opposing imperialism, to reflect the class struggle in the cities, to reflect the great reality of the socialist era, and to reflect the heroic feats of workers, peasants, and soldiers on all fronts. Therefore, the experience of using this artistic style is worth absorbing and promoting.
    The revolutionary, mass-based, and national creative practice of the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture has major exemplary significance for solving major issues such as the popularization and improvement of literary and artistic work, and for artists undergoing transformation in revolutionary practice. The fact is that the personal experiences of the masses educated the clay sculpture authors and improved their class consciousness, which further clarified the purpose of creation for whom to serve and strengthened their revolutionary enthusiasm in creation. The authors' thoughts and feelings were improved in going down to do labor, and now they regard the creative process as a transformation process of world outlook and creative methods, which makes ideology, life, and art mutually dependent and mutually influencing in creation. Also because they are constantly accepting transformation, all three aspects have been improved in the creative process, they are more consciously, actively, and creatively serving the current revolutionary struggle, rather than taking a passive and transactional attitude towards political tasks. This revolutionary change in sculpture art, relying on the authors' conscientious study of Chairman Mao's works in combination with reality, and not neglecting the revolutionization and mass-orientation of their own thoughts and feelings everywhere, is the most important reason why the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture is welcomed by the masses, and it is also the main experience that this creative activity is most worthy of artists to learn. In the future, in order to move towards a new milestone, it is very necessary to combine the reactions of the broad masses to summarize the creative experience of the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture.

    雕塑标兵
    ——参观《收租院》泥塑群象
    王朝闻
        为工农兵服务的新花
    四川美术工作者利用群雕艺术形式，塑造了一百多个等身大小的人物形象，把旧时代农民的鬼门关——地主刘文彩的收租院，变成生动的政治思想教育的课堂。这是革命文艺为工农兵服务的新成就，是文化革命的一个大胜利。它的出现适应于革命斗争的需要，也密切配合了当前革命斗争的根本任务；它是伟大的社会主义教育运动的产物，又成为对群众进行社会主义教育的有力工具。事实再一次表明：只要艺术家有为人民服务的满腔热情，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，真正投身到工农兵群众中去，把敢想敢干的革命精神和实事求是的科学态度密切结合起来，就有可能充分发挥积极性和创造性；创造出推资本主义封建主义之陈，出社会主义共产主义之新的好作品。
    雕塑创作和其他文艺作品一样，要使之成为兴无灭资、改造思想、提高觉悟、增强斗志的思想武器，它的思想内容和艺术形式都要有一番革命的变革。《收租院》泥塑作者为了充分反映地主和农民的矛盾斗争，抓紧农民与地主关系中交租与收租这一重要环节，而且力求使它的形式为群众所喜闻乐见，他们改造和吸取了传统雕塑艺术中的带戏剧性的群雕的形式。这种人物众多，规模巨大的泥塑群象，虽然不象“连环图画”那样强调故事情节，那样强调人物行动和场面的连续性，但是它那些互相联系、重点各异的大大小小的场面，对生活的反映富于感性特征，通俗易懂。这种艺术样式在旧时代为封建统治阶级所利用。今天，在破旧立新的艺术家手里，这种艺术样式有如古老的戏曲艺术成为革命现代戏那样得到新生，由麻醉群众的工具变成为无产阶级政治服务的有力武器。为了造成逼真感，作者突破了不合群众欣赏习惯、不合群众欣赏要求的“洋框框”，用玻璃球当黑眼珠。为了造成逼真感，作者把收租院现场的柱子和门户与人物、情节结合起来。为了造成逼真感，作者试图让每一个人物及行动都有个性，避免了标本模型的公式化。为了作品在政治上更有力量，作者也排斥了那种可能令人惊讶却又毫无意义的逼真感。《收租院》泥塑这样容易看懂而且发人深省地反映阶级的矛盾和斗争，在美术创作上是一个有示范意义和值得推广的创举。相对地说来，它是标兵，是样板。
    《收租院》泥塑，描写了佃农忍痛地给地主送“铁板租”，地主与狗腿子奸诈、毒辣、野蛮和无耻地验租、过斗、算账，交不够租子的佃农被逼得卖儿卖女、家破人亡的苦难遭遇，展示了一场剥削与被剥削、压迫与反压迫的矛盾和斗争，表现了农民由不觉悟到觉悟的过程。这些形象很有典型意义，很动人，很有教育作用。例如在“算账”部分，刘文彩这个“活阎王”，这个兼军阀、官僚、土豪劣绅和反动会道门头子于一身的魔鬼，挖空心思，为所欲为地压榨农民；但是因为哪里有压迫哪里就有反抗，他却又处于农民的仇恨的包围之中。这种情节和场面，有鼓动性也富于思想深度。它既表现了敌人横暴的一面，也表现了敌人软弱的一面；既表现了农民苦难的一面，又表现了农民反抗的一面。它象是对封建统治阶级的控诉，也是对于逐步觉悟而走向斗争的农民的歌颂；它代表着人民对于剥削制度进行了一场无情的审判，同时又代表着现代翻了身的人民绝不容许吃人的制度复辟的革命意志。即使是一个片段中的局部，因为它的形象真实、生动，它在艺术上起着充实整体的作用。它象政论的论据那样，在思想上起着绝不能让吃人的剥削制度复辟的作用。例如那个背着和抚着饥饿的孩子，自己也饥饿得快要站不住了的母亲，她那既不甘心立即把浸透血汗的粮食投入虎口，又一时还不明白怎样才能改变这种受迫害命运的途径；仿佛预感到愈加痛苦的遭遇还会到来，但又仿佛将要迸发出不能抑制的控诉；她那姿态和表情，特别是她那发懵的眼睛，她那好象正在喘息的嘴，包含着多么丰富的情绪内容！这种富于个性和代表性的形象，怎能不使人愈看愈激动？当地那些曾经深受迫害的农民，看了这些“交租好比上刀山，一关更比一关难”的人间地狱情景的再现，看到一组组真切生动，动人心魄的形象，怎能不引起相应的回忆和体验，激起痛恨剥削制度的强烈的阶级感情，倍加热爱社会主义新制度？
      《收租院》泥塑既是雕塑为农村服务的新花，也是革命雕塑向前迈进的里程碑。全国解放以后，我国已经产生了许多优秀的雕塑作品，但是群众的需要在不断发展和提高，因而在创作上怎样适应群众新的要求的问题，就有必要进一步解决。过去，因为雕塑家没有和工农兵密切结合，有一些作品虽然生动地记录了生活现象，但是这种记录还没有和国家的大事、人民的大事密切结合起来，缺乏时代和阶级概括性的特征。有一些作品虽然也企图反映现实中的大事，可惜缺少富于个性的生活根据，还没有孕育出创造性的主题，也就未能塑造出生动活泼、激动心弦的形象。《收租院》泥塑，既发展了革命雕塑的优良传统，也克服了思想和艺术结合得不够密切的缺点。在这里，很少看到用素材代替创作而缺乏社会意义、只是记录了琐细现象的造形；也很少出现装腔作势、内容空虚和缺乏真实感的造形，大多具有鲜明的思想倾向与完善的艺术形式，符合群众的审美趣味。不论是气得发抖地捧着一捧谷子，对穷凶极恶的狗腿子抗辩地说“这是好谷子呀”的老人，还是朝着地主吃人的大斗，抬着一箩仿佛有千斤重的谷子的母女二人；不论是象握着武器似地握着箩筐绳的妇女，还是面对张着血盆大口的大斗的老人；都是一些交织着痛惜和憎恶的心情的形象，都是作者对于剥削阶级的严正抨击。正是由于这些艺术形象具有突出的政治意义，它才保证了这套作品能够在政治思想教育工作中发挥强大力量。
    雕塑作为进行政治思想教育的工具，必须具备这样的基本特征：造形所反映的善的和美的对象，恶的和丑的对象，都必须显得比实际生活本身更便于认识。只有把各种人物的精神面貌塑造得更便于认识，形象才有鲜明的阶级倾向性和历史具体性。《收租院》泥塑，正是具有这种鲜明的政治倾向性的好作品。它没有脱离人物和情节的现实感与典型性，它的倾向性不是在造形之外任意附加上去的。因而它符合毛主席的指示——
  “革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。”这些泥塑从特定的题材着手，创造性地体现了毛主席早已指出的革命文艺的政治目的：文艺把人们看得很平淡而又是到处存在着的人剥削人、人压迫人的日常现象集中起来，把其中的矛盾和斗争典型化，从而产生“使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境”的伟大作用。
        思想革命化的结果
      《收租院》泥塑所以能够得到这样重大的成就，是由于创作者正确执行了毛主席所提出的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的路线。他们经常带着问题学习毛主席著作，掌握了正确处理题材的指导思想；经常听取群众意见，研究群众反应，比较深入地理解了群众的需要；从而不断改善造形设计。假使没有来自群众的丰富的间接生活经验，假使没有用无产阶级的立场、观点深刻认识现实，就很难运用自如地把民间艺术知识和新的创作任务适当地结合起来，对地主阶级的罪恶和农民的反抗，作出既有特殊性又有一般性的反映，典型地概括千百年来千百万农民的苦难和斗争。
    这一点很重要：正因为作者接受了无产阶级的革命理想，有革命群众代言人的政治责任感，能够站在今天的思想高度来认识现实，所以，即使作品所反映的是旧时代群众的悲惨的遭遇，也能够显示时代精神，能够为群众所接受，没有丧失革命艺术应有的教育作用和鼓舞力量。同时，正因为他们的理想没有脱离群众斗争经验的特殊性和生活遭遇的具体性，得以避免造形流于浮夸和虚假的缺点。你看：那个站在自己的空箩篼旁边，裸着上身，握紧双拳，在静态中充满动态，背部和臂部构成了有力的弓形的形式感，连肌肉都仿佛沸腾着强烈的阶级仇恨的中年农民的形象，不就是生活在苦难中，而又不是听凭命运安排的反抗者的生动的写照吗？这种反抗性当然是比较朴素的，但它恰恰符合这一个人物的觉悟程度。仇恨作为这个人物心理现象的主导性特征，是和他那心理现象的从属性特征——痛苦——同时出现的。也因为主导方面的心理现象——仇恨——得到了突出的表现，所以，这一人物的性格是鲜明的。毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造历史的动力。”泥塑作者依靠人民，逐渐丰富了间接生活经验以及直接生活经验，逐渐明确应当怎样才能更好地反映这场阶级斗争，逐渐加强了阶级感情。他们在生活上思想上群众化，在创作上才能表现群众和代表群众。依靠群众才适当发挥了造形艺术特有的表现力，惊心动魄、发人深省地再现了这一场残酷的阶级斗争。
    我们即使是从处在很次要地位的形象来看，也可以看出这套泥塑的倾向性很明确，现实性很强烈。例如那个带孝的，环抱双臂，开敞衣襟，靠着柱子，坐着空背篼，领着孩子，好象正在思索，又象正在观察的寡妇的形象，就是很有表现力的。当然，这个寡妇的丈夫是怎么被地主逼死的，亲人被逼死时她是怎样悲痛的，那没钱埋葬亲人的困境是怎样折磨着她的，这一切在这个形体上都没有（也不必要）作出直接的交代。但是，依靠瞬间现象描写的暗示作用，可能使人联想到她所经受过的许多不能容忍的遭遇。这个妇女把仅有的活命的口粮投进了贪婪的虎口，只剩下一个可以当凳子坐的空背篼，她面对着较之“过斗”关要难过的“算账”关，预感到孩子和全家更加不幸的未来。这个妇女不象别人那样已经喊出强烈的抗议，更不是别人那样捏紧了想要用来打击敌人的器械，但是她也憋着满腔怒火。这种从实际生活出发，把痛苦和仇恨结合在一起，表现形式不落陈套，具体内容并不单调的造形，不仅也象其他局部一样，具有丰富群象整体的作用，而且它自身也有相对独立性和完整性。这是作者从实际出发，在认识上避免了片面性和表面性的具体表现。我们再看那个经过了重重剥削，在冲突中被地主打伤，终于被关在私牢里，和两个孩子隔绝着的妇女的形象：她正在激烈地控诉敌人的压迫，但是作者也没有片面强调她的仇恨而抹煞她的痛苦。她和前面提到的那个紧握双拳的壮年农民一样，虽然此刻还没有找到自己救自己的革命道路，但是对于阶级敌人的剥削和压迫，显然不是麻木的旁观者，不是颓丧的失败者，不是困惑的恐惧者，而是憋不住满腔愤怒情绪，发出了强烈的控诉的反抗者。这个已经爆发出强烈抗议的妇女，和上述那个连孝布都仿佛充满了潜台词的妇女形象很有差异。这种差异，是人物的处境、性格和觉悟程度的差异的表现。作为整体中的局部，在反映阶级斗争的群象中间，这些很有特殊性的局部，都是体现革命的政治倾向性的有力依据。只要我们不是孤立地看待整体中的局部，只要我们不要求用某一个人物去代替一切，那么，这些富于个性的造形，在群象整体中就成为并不多余、相互补充的组成部分。
    《收租院》这些形象表明：农民的痛苦是阶级压迫的产物，农民的仇恨也是阶级压迫的产物。这些有所着重而又和谐地把阶级苦和阶级恨表现在一起的形象的产生，是作者掌握了正确的创作方法，给这些受压迫的农民的思想、情感、意志和心理特征作出正确判断，消除了形而上学在创作活动上的破坏作用的结果。我们看：不论是少女实在不甘心让地主风车吞食了粮食，眼泪朝肚里咽着，却又不得不踮着双脚，把粮食倒入风车里；还是乳母被拖走顶租，不能从敌人魔掌中挣脱出来，还关注着失母的婴儿；不论是老人面临算账的难关，正在无济于事地数着象征粮食的竹签；还是少年面对人间地狱而按捺不住复仇的怒火，决心埋葬吃人的社会制度，即将跟随伯伯叔叔参加游击队去；这些切合不同觉悟程度、不同性格和不同条件的人物特性的形象，对人物精神面貌的刻画，既丰富，又单纯。从创作方法来看，人物情绪内容的多面性和完整性的产生，人物动作和表情的简单化表面化的被克服，主要不是艺术技巧的提高，主要是从实际出发，辩证地对待反映对象的结果。
    在创作过程中，创作的指导思想与作品的主题的关系是这样的：当艺术家面对丰富而又庞杂的素材，如果没有阶级观点作为创作活动的思想指导，他就很难避免创作活动的盲目性。同时，正确的指导思想只有结合具体材料，才能创造出主题和形象结合得很好，都有创造性的好作品。而且这一点也很重要：创作过程这一认识过程，也就是作者主观世界的改造过程。《收租院》泥塑作者依靠群众而逐渐丰富起来的关于旧时代的生活知识，它本身已经反映了阶级关系，因而它不仅在创作过程中起丰富形象和深化形象的作用，起丰富主题和发展主题的作用，而且也在一定程度上改造了作者的世界观。作者们有时脸上挂着眼泪进行塑造；他们为啥会这样呢？这既是作者进入角色规定情境，深为群众的苦难所感动的表现，也是在创作过程这一充满矛盾的活动中，改造着自己的思想，有了群众的感情的表现。正是因为这样，作者们对于自己的劳动有了更加严格的要求，不愿意简单地图解阶级关系，不以造形的通俗易懂为满足，而要尽力提高质量。正是因为这样，泥塑作者们才有条件正确掌握领导上“既要表现人民的苦难，更要表现人民的反抗”这一正确的提示，使它在形象上得到创造性的体现。正是因为这样，《收租院》泥塑创作活动的示范性，不在于让别人照样模仿这些劳动成果，而在于它正确运用了唯物辩证法去认识现实，在于创作过程中所体现出来的实事求是的方法、态度和作风。这就是说：这些服务于无产阶级政治的好作品，只能是作者坚持自我改造，提高了思想水平的产物。
      向前迈进的新起点
    艺术创作作为对现实的反映和认识，其思想的高度如何，艺术质量如何，一方面要看作者对于当前的政治思想教育工作需要的理解如何，另一方面要看作者对他所要反映的生活的认识是不是具体、深入、正确和深刻。雕塑创作和艺术创作都是这样。譬如绘画里的《血泪童工》，作品里那个被打伤的纺纱姑娘，在亲娘怀抱里热泪盈眶，但是形象着重表现的不是痛苦，而是她对资本家的仇恨。画得很动人的这一形象，分明显示了画家的认识能力。京剧《沙家浜》里的英雄阿庆嫂，既是茶馆老板娘又是地下党员。在表演上如果抹煞前者，那就丧失了英雄所处的环境的具体性。如果稍一削弱后者，只能得到丑化英雄的坏结果。演员正确认识了这两重特征的互相依赖和互相对立的关系，才把这个在特定条件之下存在的崇高的英雄人物，完整地塑造在革命的舞台上。《收租院》泥塑中那许多比较成熟的形象，也是作者理解了农民在特定条件之下，其社会地位和思想感情的本质特征才创造出来的。
    世界观虽然不能代替创作方法，但是它包括创作方法。《收租院》泥塑许多优秀形象的产生，既是对于吃人的旧社会进行了阶级分析的表现，也是在认识上正确对待客观事物的各种特征的区别和联系的表现。创作方法的正确运用，既是以丰富的生活的经验和知识为条件的，又是以作者在创作过程中，正确接受党的领导和群众的帮助，反复深入认识客观世界而逐渐改造了自己的主观世界为条件的。假使他们没有接受世界观的改造，那就没有一切活动为了革命的热情，没有不怕失败、敢想敢干的革命闯劲，没有严肃态度和严格要求；在设计上不敢大胆利用现场的门户和柱子，也不会慎重地利用这些可以利用的现有条件。那就既抵抗不住传统观念和习惯势力，也不会适当吸取别人成功的经验，适当接受失败经验的教训，而进入崭新的更有成效的创作活动。
    正因为艺术思想和创作方法的改造，都要经过一定的过程，所以，即使是得到观众普遍赞扬的《收租院》泥塑，也还存在着有待于克服的缺点。最触目的是一些反面人物的造形或多或少地存在着不适当的漫画化，某些形体还出现了违反规定情景和人物的相互关系的现象。这当然不是说艺术不应当使它所反映的丑恶的事物显得更可憎，而是说正是为了使它更加显得可憎，在刻画这些依附恶霸地主，为着卑鄙的欲望而犯罪的狗腿子的丑恶面貌时，要从他们精神品质方面进行深刻的发掘，避免外形上的肤浅的图解，避免不合严肃的讽刺要求的夸张。“送租”部分那个监视农民的狗腿子的造形，“逼租”部分那个看门的兵痞的造形，以及“风风匠”、“刮刮匠”的造形，特别是那个腰挎短枪，脚踏拖鞋，面目狰狞，身姿轻浮的狗腿子，这种揉合了硬和软的特征，从而概括了他那既冷且酷的性格的造形，在艺术上不就是既夸张又真实的吗？可惜另外有些狗腿子的造形对于角色丑恶的精神面貌的揭露，有简单化表面化的缺点。这就未能更狠地使艺术的“子弹”，无情地射透敌人的“心脏”。正如一些正面人物
  （特别是一些青壮年）在性格、情绪的刻画上还有待于进一步加工，在愤怒情绪的表现上还应当更有变化，形象才更丰满，更耐看，也才更能体现创造性的主题那样，这种反面人物的造形还有待于加工。我们必须在创作上突出政治，严格地把艺术手法的选择摆在政治效果之下来对待。也只有适当发挥艺术的长处来突出政治，泥塑造形才能真正成为犀利的战斗武器。艺术的夸张的必要性，在于表现艺术家分明的是非，强烈的爱憎。只有经过对社会现象进行充分的观察、体验、研究、分析，才能使塑造形象的夸张手法运用得恰如其分。如果把夸张与质朴对立起来，把明确与深刻对立起来，把外形特征的一看就懂与内心状态的深刻描写对立起来，片面强调前者而丧失了后者，使前者丧失了它那可靠的生活根据，那就很难说作者已经对于客观实际，充分作了艰苦因而正确深刻和独到的分析和判断。
    十全十美的艺术品永远不会存在，《收租院》泥塑当然不是十全十美的。作者人数不多，而且大多是缺少旧时代生活经验的青年，从设计到完成只有四个半月时间，要求这一百多个等身大的塑象（此外还有百多个道具）毫无缺点，实在是不可能的。何况这批作品还准备继续加工。这些形体是不是还要着彩，是着重彩还是着淡彩，至今还在试验的过程中。而且，上述的缺点在整体中也不占主导地位，它没有取消这一面向农村，多快好省地为政治服务的创作活动的基本成就。
    《收租院》泥塑不仅是让观众看见万恶的地主刘文彩怎样剥削人民的血淋淋的现实，而且它相应地表现了必须将革命进行到底的革命思想。不是吗？观众在现场的留言簿上写道：“我带着满腔热泪看完了此院”；“我明白了爱什么，恨什么”；“我决不辜负党的教导”；“坚决与阶级敌人作永不停止的斗争”！《收租院》泥塑不仅有教育群众提高警惕，防止剥削阶级复辟的作用，而且还起着推动人们和一切来自大小刘文彩的旧思想、旧观念、旧习惯、旧趣味决裂，积极参加三大革命运动的教育作用。《收租院》作品的出现，令人信服地看到群雕这种容易为群众所接受的艺术样式，在许多革命斗争中大有用武之地。它可以用来反映反对帝国主义的革命历史，反映城市里的阶级斗争，反映社会主义时代的伟大现实，反映工农兵英雄在各个战线上的丰功伟绩。因而利用这种艺术样式的经验很值得吸取和推广。
    《收租院》泥塑这一革命化群众化民族化的创作实践，对文艺工作的普及与提高等重大问题的解决，对美术家在革命实践中经受改造，都有重大的示范意义。事实是群众的亲身经历教育了泥塑作者，提高了自己的阶级觉悟，才更加明确了为谁服务的创作目的，加强了自己在创作上的革命热情。作者的思想感情在下放劳动中就有所提高，现在又把创作过程当做世界观以及创作方法的改造过程，才使得思想、生活、艺术这三方面在创作上互相依赖、互相作用。也因为他们不断接受改造，在创作过程中这三方面都有所提高，才更加自觉地、积极地、创造性地服务于当前的革命斗争，而不是对政治任务采取被动的、事务性的态度。雕塑艺术的这一次革命的变革，依靠作者结合实际认真学习毛主席著作，处处不忽略自己思想感情的革命化、群众化，这是《收租院》泥塑受群众欢迎最重要的原因，也是这一创作活动最值得美术家学习的主要经验。今后，为了向新的里程碑迈进，很有必要结合广大群众的反应来总结《收租院》泥塑创作的经验。
