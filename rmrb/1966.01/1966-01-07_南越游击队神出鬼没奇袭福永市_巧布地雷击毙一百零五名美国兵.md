    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th – According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation Radio, guerrillas in Bien Hoa Province, South Vietnam, killed 105 American aggressors in a surprise attack on December 12th of last year.
    That day at dawn, the guerrillas of Bien Hoa Province mysteriously infiltrated Phuoc Vinh City and planted many landmines on the American First Infantry Division's athletic field. At around 5:00 AM that morning, a battalion of American soldiers who came to the athletic field for exercise stepped on the landmines, killing eighty on the spot. Many were wounded. Afterwards, two groups of American soldiers were ordered to pursue the guerrillas, but were ambushed by the guerrillas on the road, and ten American robbers were killed. In addition, the guerrillas used a clever plan to make these two groups of American soldiers fight each other, killing another fifteen American aggressors. (Attached picture)
