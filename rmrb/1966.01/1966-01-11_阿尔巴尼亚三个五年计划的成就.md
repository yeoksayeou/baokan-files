    As the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Albania approaches, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party, have victoriously completed the Third Five-Year Plan and are actively discussing and formulating the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

    Since the Albanian people gained liberation in 1944, under the leadership of the Party, they have been "holding a pick in one hand and a gun in the other," vigilantly defending their motherland while striving to build it. Over the past two decades, Albania has achieved tremendous successes in its socialist construction, rapidly changing its poor and backward pre-liberation state, and a thriving socialist country has emerged.

    During the First Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), the Albanian people accelerated the construction of the socialist economic base, transforming the motherland from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. In 1955, the industrial output value increased by approximately 2.8 times compared to 1950. Agricultural collectivization also developed greatly, with the total agricultural output value increasing by about 40 percent in five years.

    The completion of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) marked the victory of socialist ownership in Albania. The total industrial output value in 1960 increased by 2.2 times compared to 1955, and agricultural production also increased. In that year, the socialist economy accounted for approximately 99 percent of the total industrial output value, over 80 percent of the total agricultural output value, and 100 percent of the transportation industry.

    During the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), the Albanian people, in addition to continuing to rapidly develop industry, focused on developing agricultural production, especially grain production. Compared with 1960, agricultural output in 1964 increased by 56 percent for grain, 76.5 percent for rice, 42.5 percent for cotton, and nearly doubled for tobacco and sugar beets. The total agricultural output value in 1965 was also 6.4 percent higher than in 1964.

    These achievements of the Albanian people were obtained under extremely difficult conditions. Not only was Albania's economic foundation extremely backward before liberation, but after liberation, US imperialism and the Tito clique tried every possible means to blockade and sabotage Albania. In recent years, modern revisionism has also taken a series of despicable blockade and sabotage activities. Despite this, the Albanian people's march forward is unstoppable. On the basis of successfully completing the first three five-year plans, the Albanian people are now embarking on a new stage of construction, conscientiously formulating and implementing the fourth five-year plan, and confidently making more brilliant achievements in the socialist construction of their motherland.

    阿尔巴尼亚三个五年计划的成就
    当阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立二十周年来临的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，已经胜利地完成了第三个五年计划，正在积极讨论、制订第四个五年计划。
    自从阿尔巴尼亚人民在一九四四年获得解放以来，他们在党的领导下，“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”，一面警惕地保卫着祖国；一面努力建设祖国。二十多年来，阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就，解放前贫困落后的面貌已经迅速改变，一个欣欣向荣的社会主义国家已经出现了。
    在第一个五年计划（一九五一——一九五五）期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民加速进行社会主义经济基础的建设，使祖国由落后的农业国变成为农业—工业国。一九五五年的工业产值比一九五○年增加了二点八倍左右。农业集体化也有了很大发展，农业生产的总产值五年中增加了约百分之四十。
    第二个五年计划（一九五六——一九六○）的完成，使社会主义所有制在阿尔巴尼亚取得了胜利。一九六○年的工业总产值增为一九五五年的二点二倍，农业生产也有了增长。这一年，社会主义经济占工业总产值的百分之九十九左右，农业总产值的百分之八十以上，运输业的百分之百。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在第三个五年计划（一九六一——一九六五）期间，除了继续迅速地发展工业以外，还着重于发展农业生产，特别是粮食生产。一九六四年的农业产量与一九六○年相比较，粮食增加百分之五十六，水稻百分之七十六点五，棉花百分之四十二点五，烟叶和甜菜均增加将近一倍。一九六五年农业总产值还要比一九六四年增长百分之六点四。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些成就，是在极其困难的条件下取得的。因为，不仅阿尔巴尼亚解放前经济基础十分落后，而且解放以后美帝国主义和铁托集团千方百计地对阿尔巴尼亚进行封锁、破坏。近几年来，现代修正主义又采取了一系列卑鄙的封锁和破坏活动。尽管这样，阿尔巴尼亚人民前进的脚步是不可阻挡的。在胜利完成前三个五年计划的基础上，目前阿尔巴尼亚人民又将走上一个新的建设阶段，认真地制订并执行第四个五年计划，满怀信心地使祖国的社会主义建设取得更加辉煌的成就。（附图片）
