	“American Armored Vehicles Are Here to Die!”
	Chen Wenzhen’s artillery unit destroyed five American armored vehicles and eliminated thirty-seven American soldiers in the Van Tuong battle, using seven shells.
	According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, in the Van Tuong battle, the Chen Wenzhen artillery unit of a certain unit of the South Vietnam Liberation Army destroyed five enemy M-118 armored vehicles with seven shells, and at the same time annihilated thirty-seven American invaders.
	At noon on August 18 last year, American bandits frantically fired at the Liberation Army’s position. The artillery commander Chen Wenzhen and all the soldiers of this artillery unit were eager to rush over and beat the enemy severely. At this moment, suddenly, someone whispered to everyone: "Look, American armored vehicles are here to die!"
	The soldiers vigilantly watched the American armored vehicle unit that was coming from the opposite side. Behind these armored vehicles was a group of American soldiers wriggling like maggots. Chen Wenzhen ordered to cross the trenches and approach the enemy. A soldier said to the deputy artillery commander Nguyen Hoang: "Let's destroy an armored vehicle with one shell!"
	Nguyen Hoang calmly said, "Definitely hit!"
	The enemy armored vehicles approached. With a loud bang, an M-118 armored vehicle in the front staggered and stopped, emitting black smoke.
	"Hit one!" The soldiers cheered. At this moment, the Liberation Army's guns fired fiercely at the enemy, and one American devil after another fell. The soldiers of Chen Wenzhen's artillery team again destroyed another armored vehicle with accurate artillery fire. Cheers rang out again on the position.
	The enemy discovered the firepower point of Chen Wenzhen's artillery team, and two enemy planes rushed over to bomb. The Liberation Army fought back fiercely, scaring the enemy planes away in panic. The enemy's third armored vehicle tried to escape, but it was too late and was also smashed to pieces.
	The fourth and fifth armored vehicles formed a horizontal line and rushed over. Chen Wenzhen immediately ordered: "Shoot at its gun hole!" Another armored vehicle emitted thick smoke.
	"Finish off the remaining one!"
	As soon as Chen Wenzhen's order was issued, the soldier A Huo immediately fired the shell. Very accurate! The fifth armored vehicle was also written off.
	Seeing that the situation was not good, the four armored vehicles behind hurriedly turned their heads and fled, and the remaining American soldiers also slipped away in a panic.
	In this way, the soldiers of Chen Wenzhen's artillery team destroyed five American amphibious armored vehicles with only seven shells.

    “美国装甲车送死来啦！”
    陈文真炮兵单位在文相战役中，用七发炮弹炸掉美国装甲车五辆，消灭美军三十七名。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，在文相战斗中，越南南方解放军某部陈文真炮兵单位七发炮弹消灭敌人M —118型装甲车五辆，同时歼灭三十七名美国侵略者。
    去年八月十八日中午，美国强盗疯狂地向解放军阵地射击。炮长陈文真和这个炮兵单位的全体战士，恨不得立刻冲过去把敌人狠狠地揍一顿。这时，忽然，有人低声向大家说：“看，美国装甲车送死来啦！”
    战士们警惕地注视着正从对面开过来的美国装甲车部队。跟在这些装甲车后面的，是一群象蛆虫一样蠕动的美国兵。陈文真下令越过战壕，接近敌人。一个战士对副炮长阮煌说：“我们一发炮弹揍它一辆装甲车吧！”
    阮煌镇定地说，“一定打中！”
    敌人装甲车驰近了。轰隆一声巨响，走在前面的一辆M—118型装甲车踉跄了一下便停了下来，冒起黑色的烟柱。
    打中一辆啦！战士们欢呼着。就在这时，解放军的枪炮一齐向敌人猛射，美国鬼子一个又一个地倒下去了。陈文真炮队的战士们，又以准确的炮火击毁了另一辆装甲车。阵地上再一次响起了欢呼声。
    敌人发现了陈文真炮队的火力点，两架敌机冲过来轰炸。解放军进行了猛烈的还击，打得敌机惊慌地逃走了。敌人的第三辆装甲车企图逃跑，但太迟了，也被打得稀烂。
    第四、第五辆装甲车摆成一列横队冲过来。陈文真立刻命令：“朝它的枪眼打！”又一辆装甲车冒出了浓烟。
    “剩下的一辆也干掉它！”
    陈文真的命令一下达，战士阿活立刻把炮弹打出去。准确得很！第五辆装甲车也给报销了。
    后面的四辆装甲车见势不妙，慌忙掉转车头逃跑，剩下来的美国兵也跟着狼狈地溜走了。
    就这样，陈文真炮队的战士们仅用了七发炮弹，就击毁五辆美国两栖装甲车。
