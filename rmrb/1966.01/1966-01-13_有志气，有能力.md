    Aspiring and Capable
    Xiaojiang
    Shanghai's innovation vanguard, Wang Linhe, along with other comrades, recently successfully trial-produced an advanced precision measuring instrument. When they started designing, they borrowed a document from the Shanghai Library. The Shanghai Library searched its entire catalog but couldn't find it, so they made a long-distance call to the Beijing Library requesting assistance. The Beijing Library found that two letters in the document name were written incorrectly, and wired back to Shanghai, finally locating the document. This document contained seventy to eighty thousand words, and the unit entrusted with the task broke convention, overcame difficulties, and completed the translation task, which normally required a month of work, in just six days. With the document, Wang Linhe and others, relying on the close cooperation of all parties in the trial production process, successfully solved several key problems and finally successfully trial-produced this measuring instrument.
    Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people have ambition and ability and must catch up with and surpass the advanced world levels in the not too distant future." Regarding "ambition," people now see it very clearly. The Chinese people will never be content with a backward state of production technology. We must catch up quickly. In catching up, we are not copying, but surpassing, "doing what others dare not do, and winning where others cannot easily win." Our goal is not to crawl behind others, but to run at the forefront of the world's advanced levels. As for "ability," not everyone has recognized it very clearly. Some people who are blindly infatuated with material and technical conditions are still a little skeptical: with poor material and technical conditions, can we really catch up and surpass? The example above shows, from an important aspect, that the skepticism is unfounded, and we are fully capable of catching up with and surpassing the advanced world levels.
    This ability is the collective creativity. Everything in the world is created by people. The Chinese people have brains and hands just like everyone else, and we don't have any less. Just in this regard, what others can do, we can also do. What's more, we are people who have been liberated, people who live under the socialist system, and people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are a strong revolutionary collective. The people in this revolutionary collective, for the revolutionary goal of catching up and surpassing, are not afraid of difficulties, "knowing there are difficulties and advancing in the face of them"; not afraid of hardship, "knowing there is hardship and taking pleasure in it"; at the same time, for the common revolutionary ideal, the 650 million brains in this collective are tightly united, and the 650 million hands are tightly clasped together. This can generate earth-shattering, world-changing, and sea-churning great power. The "power" of self-reliance that we often talk about is also realized here. Relying on this revolutionary collective creativity, not only can we do what others have already done, but we can also do what others have not done; we can also do what others have done in a relatively long time in a relatively short time.

    有志气，有能力
    晓江
    上海革新闯将王林鹤和其他同志一起，最近又试制成功一项高级的精密计量仪器。开始设计时，他们向上海图书馆借阅一份资料。上海图书馆找遍了整个图书目录也找不到，就挂长途电话到北京图书馆请求协助寻找。北京图书馆查明是写错了资料名称中的两个字母，回电到上海，终于把这份资料找到了。这份资料共有七、八万字，接受委托的单位打破常规，设法克服困难，仅仅用了六天时间，就完成了这个需要一个月工作量的翻译任务。有了资料，王林鹤等在试制过程中，又依靠各方面的通力协作，顺利地解决了几个关键问题，终于把这个计量仪器试制成功。
    毛主席说：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”关于“有志气”，现在人们都看得很清楚了。中国人民决不安于生产技术上的落后状态。我们要急起直追。在追赶中，我们不是抄，而是超，“为人之不敢为，胜人之不易胜”。我们的目标不是跟在别人屁股后面爬行，而是要跑在世界先进水平的最前头。至于“有能力”，则并不是所有的人都已经认识得很清楚。一些一味迷恋物质技术条件的人，就还有点怀疑：物质技术条件差，能不能真正赶超上去？上面讲的这个事例，从一个重要方面表明，怀疑是没有根据的，我们是有充分能力赶超世界先进水平的。
    这个能力就是集体的创造力。世界上一切都是人创造的。中国人民一样有着大脑和双手，不比别人少什么。单就这点来说，别人能做到的事，我们就一样能做到。更何况，我们是已经获得解放的人，是生活在社会主义制度下的人，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。我们是一个坚强的革命集体。这个革命集体中的人，为了赶超的革命目标，一不怕难，“明知困难，知难而进”；二不怕苦，“明知有苦，以苦为乐”；同时，为了革命的共同理想，这个集体中的六亿五千万个大脑还紧紧合在一起，六亿五千万双手还紧紧握在一起。这就可以产生动天撼地、翻江倒海的伟大力量。我们常说的自力更生的“力”，也就落实在这里。凭借这种革命集体创造力，岂但别人已经做到的事，就是别人没有做到的事，我们也能做到；别人用较长时间做到的事，我们也能用较短的时间做到。
