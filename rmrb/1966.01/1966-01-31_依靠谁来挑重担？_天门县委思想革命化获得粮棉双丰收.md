    Rely on Whom to Shoulder the Heavy Burden?
    ——Tianmen County Party Committee's Ideological Revolutionization Achieves a Double Harvest of Grain and Cotton

    Tianmen County in Hubei, known for its cotton production, achieved a double harvest of grain and cotton last year. Cotton production increased substantially, and the county became self-sufficient in grain. This "double" in the double harvest did not come easily; it was the result of the Tianmen County Party Committee thoroughly relying on the masses, believing in the masses, and realizing ideological revolutionization.

    Is the reason with the leadership or with the masses?

    Tianmen is a large county with a population of over one million. Of its two million mu of cultivated land, cotton occupies more than 700,000 mu, and the area of grain fields is also considerable, but the county has never been self-sufficient in grain. Before 1962, the Tianmen County Party Committee debated a question: for a large county like Tianmen, located in the Jianghan Plain with its unique advantages and large areas for both grain and cotton, should cotton be the main focus, or should grain be the main focus? In fact, the focus of the debate was not which should be the main focus, but whether to dare to strive for a double harvest of grain and cotton.

    Why didn't Tianmen County dare to strive for a double harvest of grain and cotton? County Party Secretary Sun Lianqing said: "Tianmen County's work has been relatively good since the period of mutual aid and cooperation, and its contribution of cotton to the state has increased year by year. It also recovered relatively quickly after the three years of natural disasters. However, the County Party Committee did not correctly treat historical experience, did not see the objective situation developing forward, and especially did not see the new revolutionary demands of the masses. This led to a mental state that was neither backward nor cutting edge." The specific manifestation of this mental state was the view of the relationship between grain and cotton as one where only one could be grasped, and the two could not be combined.

    Last winter and spring, Tianmen County carried out a preliminary socialist education movement. The County Party Committee, carrying this question in its guiding ideology, studied Chairman Mao's works, and shouldered the burden of contributing as much as possible to the state. There are low standards and high standards for contributing to the state. The low standard is to engage in production according to general conventions, to sell as many products to the state as possible, and at the same time, to request the state to supply as much as possible; the high standard is to have the world revolution in mind, to have the 600 million people in heart, and to do everything possible to increase both cotton and grain, and to shoulder as heavy a burden as possible for the state.

    Every year when the grain harvest is good, cotton farmers are happy; when the cotton grows well, the people in the grain areas are also happy, indicating that a double harvest of grain and cotton is the desire and demand of the masses. Can a double harvest of grain and cotton be achieved? Qidong County in Jiangsu provided experience in this regard, and Tianmen County also showed such signs in 1958, but the County Party Committee grasped it and then let go, and did not persist. Why did they do it and then stop? According to the County Party Committee comrades, this was mainly because the County Party Committee did not throw itself into the revolutionary struggle of the masses, did not see the great socialist enthusiasm hidden in the masses, and therefore did not dare to lead the masses.

    If the Leadership Dares to Shoulder, the Masses Dare to Shoulder as Well

    How to increase both grain and cotton? The revolutionary practice of Tianmen County in the past year has proved that the key is to rely on the masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants. To rely on the masses, how to view the masses? This is the prerequisite. Before 1963, the Tianmen County Party Committee did not dare to do or even think about jumping and leaping forward. When other places produced models, they didn't believe it. At that time, some production teams had already reached high-yield levels in cotton production per mu. The creations of the masses were already in front of them, but some cadres still said: "It's easy to say for small-area high yields, it's hard to say for large areas."

    Before the three years of natural disasters, the Tianmen County Party Committee had great revolutionary enthusiasm. It engaged in water conservancy construction and scientific experiments. The County Party Committee had sufficient estimates of the enthusiasm of the masses, leading the masses, supporting the masses, and creating some advanced experiences that were famous throughout the country. Not long after, why were some things that should be done, could be done, and had already been successfully done by the masses, not accurately seen and firmly grasped by the County Party Committee? According to the County Party Committee comrades, this was mainly because there were problems with the County Party Committee's guiding ideology, which also proved that they were not so firm in the fundamental viewpoint of resolutely trusting the people. Some comrades did not dare to lead the masses, and there was also this excuse: peasant affairs, don't grasp them too tightly, we must act according to "consciousness"!

    Now, once the County Party Committee initially changed its guiding ideology, dared to shoulder heavy burdens, and put the power of relying on the people first, the million masses of Tianmen County also followed suit. At the beginning of last year, the County Party Committee did two things: one was to discuss a three-year plan for grain and cotton to be pursued together in an all-round development; the other was to convene a representative meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants, organizing the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants into the struggle of production revolution. The result was that wherever the County Party Committee pointed, the masses would fight there, and they would win every battle. Taking the promotion of improved cotton varieties as an example, there were only tens of thousands of mu the year before, and last year all 740,000 mu of cotton fields had to be promoted. The amount of work and the requirements were unprecedented. This difficulty did not stop the Tianmen County Party Committee, nor did it stop the masses of Tianmen County. Cadres and masses throughout the county studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" three times, overcame numerous difficulties, and won the first victory for cotton production. In April and May last year, Tianmen County suffered a snail pest that had not been seen for many years, with 480,000 mu of cotton fields lacking seedlings, with severe cases lacking more than 70% of seedlings. The County Party Committee organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's works and, in the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, picked up snails one by one from the cotton fields, braving wind and rain. Missing seedlings were replanted, so that 90% of the affected cotton fields reached full seedlings. Water conservancy construction was also a leap forward last year, with the completion of water conservancy projects such as the Tiannan Canal. Last year, from April to August, there was no thorough rain throughout the county. Because the County Party Committee mobilized the masses to fight drought and diverted Han River water for irrigation, it still guaranteed a double harvest of grain and cotton.

    Viewing the Masses with Mao Zedong Thought

    To ensure a double harvest of grain and cotton throughout the county, it is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people throughout the county. Here, there is a question of how to view the masses of backward communes and teams.

    In the past, the Tianmen County Party Committee always thought that everything was backward in the backward communes and teams. Therefore, the cadres who were stationed in these places did not enthusiastically encourage them ideologically and politically and give full play to the wisdom and strength of the broad masses, but often started from old frameworks, did everything for them, or simply gave them material support. The masses summarized this leadership as "six grasps and six non-grasps," namely: only grasping work, not grasping study; only grasping technology, not grasping politics; only grasping support, not grasping self-reliance; only grasping dead systems, not grasping living thoughts; only grasping current production, not grasping long-term basic construction; only grasping criticism, not grasping praise. In a word, they did not see the enthusiasm of the cadres and masses in these communes and teams, so they did not believe in them and did not rely on them. How could they mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses?

    The Heiliu Commune in the Xiaomiao District of Tianmen County was a backward unit. The cadres here had such arguments: "Heiliu is 'four deaths': the masses are dead backward, the cadres are dead losing out, the work is dead passive, and the superiors are dead disbelieving. Even red cadres will be ineffective when transferred to Heiliu." Since the winter before last, the socialist education movement has changed the cadres of this commune. They were determined to change the backward situation. How to change it? It is still necessary to rely on the masses here. They used Chairman Mao's viewpoint of dividing one into two to summarize their past work and examine their thoughts of not trusting the masses, and found that Heiliu was not all backward. Tang Zongfan, deputy secretary of the district party committee, said: "It is not that Heiliu is dead backward, but that we are dead-eyed looking at living things, and we have looked at Heiliu to death." This transformation shows that once people, places, and things are viewed with Mao Zedong Thought, positive factors are seen, and it is understood that everything is developing and changing, thereby finding the great creativity of the masses.

    Let the Masses Give Scores to the Leadership

    The comrades of the Tianmen County Party Committee adopted a completely different attitude in the struggle to win a double harvest of grain and cotton. When encountering new technologies that were relatively difficult to promote, the leading cadres of the County Party Committee first went to the grassroots level to stay, and ran three-way combination experimental fields. They resolutely implemented eating, living, and laboring together, and consciously accepted supervision from the masses. Once, a county party secretary made a mistake in his technical operation while controlling insects with the masses. The masses immediately offered suggestions, and he corrected it immediately. Humbly accepting supervision from the masses, especially consciously listening to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thus aroused people's enthusiasm. The masses said that such experimental fields are "model fields" of the class line, which changed the past situation of "I say, you do" and only talking but not doing. Accepting supervision is not empty talk. The comrades of the Tianmen County Party Committee let the poor and lower-middle peasants give "scores" to the leadership. In this way, the masses and cadres wholeheartedly ran experimental fields, and everyone worked together, so new technologies were easily promoted. Last year, the Tianmen County's promotion of new technologies was greater than in any previous year. "Let the masses test" is proof of the Tianmen County Party Committee's determination to revolutionize.

    Of course, there are advanced and backward distinctions among the masses. But as long as the leadership work is done well, specific problems are analyzed specifically, and typical demonstrations are adhered to, the problems are easier to solve.

    How to treat the masses? Is it to put oneself among the masses and guide them forward by taking advantage of the situation, or to stand above the masses and issue orders? This is a question that must be resolved in the revolutionization of a county party committee. Because the Tianmen County Party Committee had a certain understanding of this issue and really did a lot of work, it achieved greater results in last year's production struggle.

### 依靠谁来挑重担？——天门县委思想革命化获得粮棉双丰收

    依靠谁来挑重担？
    ——天门县委思想革命化获得粮棉双丰收
    一向以产棉著称的湖北天门县，去年粮棉双丰收。棉花大幅度增产，粮食做到了自给有余。这个双丰收的“双”字来之不易，它是中共天门县委彻底依靠群众、相信群众，实现思想革命化的结果。
    原因在领导，还是在群众？
    天门是百万以上人口的大县，二百万亩耕地中，棉花占七十多万亩，粮田面积也不少，但口粮一直不能自给。一九六二年以前，天门县委争论着一个问题，象天门这样一个大县，地处江汉平原，得天独厚，粮棉的面积都很大，究竟应当以棉为主？还是以粮为主？其实，争论的焦点，不在以什么为主，而是敢不敢争取粮棉双丰收。
    为什么天门县不敢争取粮棉双丰收？县委书记孙连清说：“天门县从互助合作时期起，工作就比较好，对国家贡献的棉花一年比一年多。在三年自然灾害之后，恢复得也比较快。但是县委没有正确地对待历史经验，没有看清客观形势向前发展，特别是没有看到群众新的革命要求。由此而形成了既不落后、也不冒尖的精神状态。”这种精神状态的具体表现，就是对粮和棉的关系，认为只能抓一手，二者不能得兼。
    前冬去春，天门县进行了初步的社会主义教育运动，县委带着指导思想上的这个问题，学习毛主席的著作，把尽多地对国家作出贡献这个担子承担起来了。对国家有贡献，有低标准，也有高标准。低标准，就是按照一般常规搞生产，能交售给国家多少产品就交售多少，同时，尽多地要求国家供应自己东西；高标准，就是眼看全世界革命，心怀六亿人民，尽一切可能，把棉花和粮食双双搞上去，对国家能挑多重的担子，就挑多重的担子。
    每年粮食丰收，棉农高兴；棉花长得好，粮区人民也高兴，说明粮棉双丰收是群众的愿望和要求。粮棉能否双丰收？江苏启东县提供了这方面经验，天门县在一九五八年也出现过这样的苗头，只是县委抓抓又放了，没有坚持下来。为什么做做又不做了？据县委同志说，这主要是县委没有投身群众的革命斗争中，看不到群众中蕴藏着很大的社会主义积极性，因而不敢起来领导群众。
    领导敢挑，群众也敢挑
    怎样使粮棉都上去？一年来天门县革命化的实践证明，关键是依靠群众，特别是贫下中农。要依靠群众，怎样看群众？这是前提。一九六三年以前，天门县委对于跳一跳，跃一跃，不敢做，也不敢想，别个地方做出样子来了，也不相信。当时有一些生产队，棉花亩产量已经达到高产水平。群众的创造已经摆在面前，有的干部还说：“小面积高产么好说，要大面积难说。”
    天门县委在三年自然灾害以前，革命干劲很大，搞水利建设、办科学实验，县委对群众的积极性有足够的估计，领导群众，支持群众，创造了一些全国闻名的先进经验。时隔不久，为什么有些该办的、能办的，而且群众已经办成功了的事，县委就看不准，抓不狠呢？据县委同志说，这主要是县委指导思想上有了问题，也证明了他们在坚决信任人民群众这个根本观点上并不那么牢靠。有些同志不敢领导群众，还有这样一种借口：农民的事情么，莫抓狠了，要根据“觉悟”办事！
    现在，一当县委初步改变了自己的指导思想，敢于挑重担子，把依靠人民群众的力量放在第一位，天门县的百万群众也跟着起来了。去年一开春，县委就做了两件事：一是讨论了粮棉并举，全面发展的三年计划；二是召开贫下中农代表会，把绝大多数贫下中农，都组织到生产革命斗争中去。结果是，县委指到那儿，群众就打到那儿，而且每战必胜。以推广棉花良种来说，前年只有几万亩，去年七十四万亩棉田要全部推广，工作量之大，要求之高，是过去无法比的。这一难，没有难住天门县委，也没有难住天门县的群众，全县干部和群众三学《愚公移山》，战胜重重困难，为棉花生产打了第一个胜仗。去年四五月，天门县发生了多年未见的蜗牛虫害，有四十八万亩棉田缺苗，严重的缺苗百分之七十以上。县委组织群众学习毛主席著作，用愚公移山的精神，披风顶雨，从棉田里把一个个蜗牛拾起来。缺苗的重新补苗，使百分之九十的受害棉田，达到了全苗。去年水利建设也是一个飞跃，修成了天南水渠等水利工程。去年四月到八月全县没有下过透雨，由于县委发动群众抗旱，引汉水灌溉，仍然保证了粮、棉双双丰收。
    用毛泽东思想看群众
    要保证全县粮棉双丰收，就要把全县人民的积极性充分地调动起来。这里有一个对落后社、队群众的看法问题。
    天门县委过去对后进的社、队，总认为一切都是落后的。因此，到这些地方蹲点的干部，不是满腔热情地从思想政治上进行鼓励，充分发挥广大群众的智慧和力量，而是往往从老框框出发，包办代替，或是单纯从物质上给以扶持。群众把这种领导概括为“六抓六不抓”，即：只抓工作，不抓学习；只抓技术，不抓政治；只抓支援，不抓自力更生；只抓死制度，不抓活思想；只抓当前生产，不抓长远基本建设；只抓批评，不抓表扬。一句话，他们没有看到这些社、队干部和群众的积极性，因此不相信他们，不依靠他们，这怎么能够把广大群众的积极性调动起来呢？
    天门县小庙区有一个黑流公社，是个后进单位，这里干部有过这样的论调：“黑流是‘四死’：群众死落后，干部死吃亏，工作死被动，上级死不相信。红干部调到黑流也会无所作为。”从前年冬天起，社会主义教育运动使这个公社的干部变了，他们决心要改变落后的面貌，如何改变呢？还是要依靠这里的群众。他们运用主席两分法的观点，总结了过去的工作，检查了自己不信任群众的思想，发现黑流并不是一切都落后。区委副书记汤宗璠说：“不是黑流死落后，而是我们死眼看活物，把黑流看死了。”这个转变说明，一旦用毛泽东思想去看人、看地、看物，就看出了积极因素，懂得一切事物都是在发展变化，从而找到了群众的伟大创造力所在。
    让群众来给领导打“分数”
    天门县委的同志，在夺取粮棉双丰收的斗争中，采取了完全与过去不同的态度。遇到比较难以推广的新技术，县委领导干部先去蹲点，办三结合试验田。坚决实行同吃、同住、同劳动，自觉地接受群众监督。有一次，一位县委书记和群众一起治虫，他的技术操作错了，群众立刻提意见，他马上改正了。虚心接受群众监督，特别是有意识地听取贫下中农的意见，这样，就把人们的积极性调动起来了。群众说，这样的试验田是阶级路线的“样板田”，改变了过去“我说，你做”和光说不做的状况。接受监督不是一句空话，天门县委的同志让贫下中农来给领导打“分数”。这样，群众和干部一心一意办试验田，大家动手，新技术也就容易推广了。去年天门县推广新技术，比过去任何一年的成果都大。“让群众来检验”，是天门县委决心革命化的证明。
    当然，群众中也有先进与落后之分。但只要领导工作做到家了，对待具体问题作具体分析，坚持典型示范，问题就比较容易解决。
    如何对待群众？是把自己置于群众之中，因势利导引导群众前进，还是站在群众之上发号施令？这是一个县委革命化中必须加以解决的问题。天门县委由于在这个问题上有了一定的认识，又真正做了许多工作，因此在去年的生产斗争中取得了较大的成绩。
