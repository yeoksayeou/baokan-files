　　New China News Agency, Washington, 6th Dispatch: The Johnson government has recently dispatched a large number of important officials to run around and promote its widely publicized fourteen-point plan for a so-called "peaceful" solution to the Vietnam issue. This fourteen-point plan was first announced by the United States Information Agency, the official propaganda organ of the United States, on December 27. On January 3, the White House issued a document entitled "The Heart of the Vietnam Issue," again listing these fourteen points.

　　What exactly is the fourteen-point plan, which the Johnson government calls "America's Contribution to the Basket of Peace?" It turns out that this is just another concentrated exposure of the gangster logic of American imperialism. The USIA report and the White House document not only fail to admit that US imperialism is the aggressor, but instead slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as the "aggressor," demanding the so-called "Hanoi to end its aggression against South Vietnam." It not only does not indicate that the United States intends to stop its aggression and completely withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, but on the contrary, it indicates that the United States will continue to occupy the South and threaten the North. The White House document also emphasizes the so-called "obligation" of the United States to "maintain the security of South Vietnam," saying that this "obligation" "concerns not only South Vietnam, or even Southeast Asia; but also the integrity of the obligations undertaken by the United States and the importance of these obligations to world peace." These words completely expose the hypocrisy of the Johnson government's so-called "we have put everything into the peace basket" and thoroughly expose the cunning face of the American robber.

　　Regarding this fourteen-point plan, which the Johnson government is so keen on, even the New York Times, in its January 3 editorial, had to admit that this plan "does not offer any new substantive suggestions, but merely repeats the line taken by President Johnson in his speech in Baltimore last April, with urgent emphasis." United Press International said that this plan is nothing more than "piecing together various points that have been talked about piecemeal in the past" and "does not make any indication of changing the basic position." "The United States is flexible on many negotiable minor issues, but it will never waver on the fundamental issue of protecting South Vietnam from aggression."

　　Whether it is fourteen points or fourteen hundred points, as long as the most fundamental point is missing, that is, American imperialism admits that it is the aggressor against Vietnam and completely withdraws its troops from South Vietnam, then this kind of plan is worthless and is the most clumsy deception.

　　The full text of the US fourteen-point plan issued by the United States Information Agency is as follows:

　　(1) It has been said that the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements will provide a sufficient basis for peace in Southeast Asia;

　　(2) It has been said that it would welcome a conference on the whole of Southeast Asia or any part of Southeast Asia;

　　(3) It has been said that it is willing to conduct negotiations without any preconditions;

　　(4) It has been said that it is willing to conduct unconditional discussions outside the scope of formal meetings;

　　(5) It has been said that a cessation of hostilities would be an appropriate primary issue for any negotiations or discussions (Note: The White House document reads: "A cessation of hostilities could be dealt with first at a conference, or it could be a matter for preliminary discussion");

　　(6) It has been said that Hanoi's four-point proposition is open to discussion;

　　(7) It has been indicated that the United States does not want bases in Southeast Asia;

　　(8) It has been said that the United States does not want to continue to station military personnel in South Vietnam;

　　(9) It has been indicated that it supports free elections in Vietnam;

　　(10) It has agreed that the issue of reunification should be arranged through free discussions by the people concerned;

　　(11) It has agreed that Southeast Asian countries should be neutral, if that is their choice;

　　(12) It has been said that it is very willing to use its resources for the economic and social construction of Southeast Asia, and if peace is achieved, North Vietnam can participate in that regional effort;

　　(13) It has been said (President Johnson said at a press conference in July) that if Hanoi ends its aggression against the South, it will not be difficult for the Viet Cong to make its views heard;

　　(14) It has been said that it can stop bombing the North if it can get an indication of what such a cessation of bombing would bring. (Note: The White House document reads: "We have said publicly and privately that we can stop bombing North Vietnam as a step towards peace, although the other side has not had the slightest hint or indication of what they would do if the bombing stopped.")

### 美国兜售的十四点计划是什么货色？  连美国报刊也承认，这是约翰逊历来和谈诡计的大杂烩

    美国兜售的十四点计划是什么货色？
    连美国报刊也承认，这是约翰逊历来和谈诡计的大杂烩
    新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：约翰逊政府最近派遣大批要员四出奔走，推销它大肆宣扬的所谓“和平”解决越南问题的十四点计划。这个十四点计划首先由美国官方宣传机构美国新闻处在十二月二十七日予以公布。一月三日，白宫又发表一个题为
  《越南问题的中心》的文件，再次罗列了这十四点。
    约翰逊政府称为“美国对和平的篮子的贡献”的十四点计划，究竟是什么货色？原来，这不过是美帝国主义的强盗逻辑的又一次集中大暴露。美新处的报道和白宫的文件不仅没有承认美帝国主义自己是侵略者，反而诬蔑越南民主共和国是“侵略者”，要求所谓“河内结束对南越的侵略”；它不仅没有表示美国打算停止侵略，从越南南方全部撤出它的军队，相反的，它表示美国要继续霸占南方，威胁北方。白宫的文件还强调美国所谓“维护南越安全”的“义务”，说什么这种“义务”“关系到的不只是南越，甚至不只是东南亚；而且也关系到美国承担的义务的完整性和这种义务对全世界和平的重要性”。这番话完全揭穿了约翰逊政府所谓“我们已经把所有东西放进了和平篮子”的虚伪性，彻底暴露了美国强盗的狡狯嘴脸。
    对于约翰逊政府所如此津津乐道的这个十四点计划，甚至连《纽约时报》在一月三日的社论中也不得不承认，这个计划“没有提出任何新的实质性建议，而只是重复总统约翰逊去年四月在巴尔的摩发表的演说中采取的路线，并加以紧急的强调”。合众国际社说，这个计划不过是“把过去零零碎碎谈到的各点拼凑在一起”，而并“没有作出改变基本立场的表示”。“美国在许多可以谈判的次要问题上态度是灵活的，但是在保护南越不受侵略这一基本问题上决不动摇”。
      不管是十四点也好，还是一千四百点也好，只要缺少最根本一点，即美帝国主义承认自己是对越南的侵略者，并且从越南南方全部撤出它的军队，那么，这种计划就是一文不值的东西，就是最拙劣的骗局。
    美国新闻处发的美国的十四点计划全文如下：
      （一）已经说过，一九五四年和一九六二年日内瓦协议将会为东南亚和平提供充足的基础；
      （二）已经说过，它将欢迎就整个东南亚或东南亚任何部分举行会议；
      （三）已经说过，它愿意进行没有任何先决条件的谈判；
      （四）已经说过，它愿意进行在正式会议范围之外的无条件讨论；
      （五）已经说过，停止敌对行动将是任何谈判或讨论的适当的首要问题（按：白宫文件作：“停止敌对行动可以作为一个会议上首先处理的事务，或者可以作为预备性讨论的问题”）；
      （六）已经说过，河内的四点主张是可以讨论的；
      （七）已经表明，美国不希望在东南亚有基地；
      （八）已经说过，美国不希望在南越继续留驻军事人员；
      （九）已经表明，它支持在越南举行自由选举；
      （十）已经同意，应该通过有关人民自由讨论来安排重新统一问题；
      （十一）已经同意，东南亚国家应该是中立的，如果这是它们的选择；
      （十二）已经说过，它很愿意以它的资源用于东南亚的经济和社会建设，如果实现和平的话，北越可以参加那种地区性努力；
      （十三）已经说过（约翰逊总统在七月份举行的记者招待会上说），如果河内结束对南方的侵略，越共不难使它的意见让人听到；
      （十四）已经说过，它可以停止轰炸北方，如果它能得到迹象表明，这种停炸将带来什么。（按：白宫文件作：“我们公开和私下都说过，我们可以停止轰炸北越作为走向和平的一个步骤，虽然对方对于如果停止轰炸的话他们将会做些什么一直没有最细微的暗示或表示。”）
