    The Song of Mao Zedong
    ——Letters from Daqing
    Wei Gangyan

    Dear Comrade:
      It's past nine o'clock in the evening, what are you doing? If you're not too busy, come with me to the Daqing Oilfield!

    People often say that you can only see far by climbing high. Why don't we go up to that tall derrick and open our eyes. How about it? Isn't it exhilarating? I dare say, even the most composed person would gasp "Oh my!" at this brilliant sea of lights.

    Just a few years ago, this was just a vast wilderness under a single blue sky, a "battlefield" dotted with tents and clusters of bonfires. Today, regardless of the master of the White House's open blockade or the traitorous lackeys' underhanded sabotage, our oilfield, with miraculous speed and astonishing standards, has appeared on the Earth with radiant glory!

      "What is this power?" Many people asked the workers of the Daqing Oilfield. "We started with 'Two Theories'!" they said, holding up their well-worn *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*. At first glance, you might not understand. But if you live and fight here long enough, you will understand that every oil well, every building, every inch of pipeline, every road, and those towering derricks, refineries, and oil tanks are precisely the symbols of the revolutionary transformation of this heroic team, the fruits gained from studying Mao Zedong Thought.

    Take the derrick we're standing on, for example. Below, they're drilling an ultra-deep well. The rock cuttings from the strata are so hard they can scratch glass, and attacking it is an even tougher hard-bone drilling team. On the drilling site, cook Lao Pei had just put down his meal buckets and was squatting there, pondering a used drill bit. Two days ago, he wrote a letter of suggestions for improvement to the drill bit tackling team, moving the technicians to immediately send him letters of determination and gratitude. Someone jokingly asked him: "What does the drill bit have to do with you, the cook?" He said: "I'm a cook, but I'm a revolutionary cook. I have to care about what the revolution is worried about." That's the kind of cook he is!

    On the road, a couple were "negotiating" something. The woman had a Jiangsu accent: "Everyone sees that I work well. This time, we've been selected to move into a new house first, wouldn't you be honored too? Come tomorrow, I'll pick you up at the door!" The man seemed a little embarrassed: "Then wouldn't I be your dependent!" The woman chuckled: "You're even studying Chairman Mao's works, this is called transformation! You support half the sky in industry, we support half the sky in agriculture, who depends on who?" That's the kind of family member she is!

    In front of the dormitory, the workers on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift were sitting on small benches, holding a meeting. An apprentice said with a childish voice: "It's good that the stratum is hard. We especially love touching the tiger's butt! The higher the mountain, the more prospects; the bigger the difficulty, the more we dare to break through; the deeper the well, the more we have to drill! Strategically, we despise thousands of meters, but tactically, we must pay attention to every centimeter. We must learn from Master Zhang, who guarded his post in the freezing cold to collect sand, and when asked to take a break, he said: 'The mud tank is the front line. Letting go of a grain of sand to wear down the machine is like letting an enemy drill into the revolutionary ranks.' That's the kind of strictness and ruthlessness we want! Otherwise, what kind of working class are we?" That's the kind of driller he is!

    These aren't even the model workers or top performers here, and yet their feelings for the Party and the revolution are so deep! Their language, filled with Mao Zedong Thought, is all heartfelt everyday talk. With such family members, such cooks, such workers, how could we not have such an oilfield!

    I once received a kind observer who often praised our abundant vegetable stalls and meat markets. He said: "I'm only interested in the facts." Before leaving, he said: "I personally saw housewives carrying vegetable baskets and white-haired lathe operators queuing up at bookstores to buy *Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works*. I don't understand what kind of power this book has? Why can a rural woman take the stage to give a philosophical report on *On Practice*? Why can Chairman Mao's quotations become the language of daily life in the streets and alleys, workshops, and villages?"

    Please let the workers of the heroic oilfield answer this question!

    Do we need to talk about faraway things? Just come to the dormitory of this hard-bone drilling team, and let me introduce you to someone. Yes, that's the person leaning against the headboard with a jacket over his shoulders. His name is Wei Guangrong, a "Five-Good" pacesetter, a model squad leader. Right now, he is studying Chairman Mao's works by the light shielded by a newspaper. Look! He's gripping the book tightly, frowning, and staring directly at the pages. Is that how you read a book?

    This isn't reading a book, it's not reciting an article. In his words: "I'm climbing mountains and crossing seas, trying to find Chairman Mao!"

    If you don't understand his background, it's hard to understand what he means.

    Wei Guangrong, an orphan who grew up eating food from a hundred families and taking the heavens and the earth as his home, sleeping in grass nests and wearing straw capes, was forged by the fire of hatred into a young hired laborer. Right after liberation, he walked into the big temple where the work team was staying and said: "I've finally found a home!" Then, he picked up a stick and fought the landlord. Did they want to make trouble? He swung his stick and went for it. The work team tried to stop him, and he raised his eyebrows: "If we don't hit him, should we invite him to a feast?" At sixteen, he became the militia captain. At eighteen, he rushed to volunteer for the army to resist America and aid Korea. Anyway, his life was intertwined with the Communist Party. He swore to join the Party amid the sounds of cannons, and he transferred to work in the petroleum industry in response to the call. When he worked, he got so focused that his eyes turned red. No matter who you were, Zhang San or Li Si, he would "scold" you if you didn't work as hard as he did. When he touched the brake handle, he got energized, braking hard and accelerating suddenly, flying up and down, making the derrick tremble. People loved and hated him, calling him "Wei the Tiger."

    He was advised, criticized, and he also made up his mind to correct himself. But as soon as he got on the drilling platform, his eyes turned red again. He wished he could punch a well out of the ground with one fist! Could we let the reactionaries' hands be stuck in our necks?

    In the winter of the year before last, it was so cold that you couldn't stretch out your hands. Driller Lao Xia crawled into the drilling machine to change the brake band, sweating profusely. Lao Wei was waiting outside, getting impatient, and blurted out: "Come out quickly, you're as stupid as a pig!" These words hit Lao Xia's heart like a thunderbolt. He had heard these words for years, ever since he was twelve and started herding cattle for a rich peasant. Not enough grass cut: "Lazy pig!" The ox broke loose: "Dead pig!" Once, he was scolded so hard that his teeth gnashed together. He turned around and rushed out the door, and ran into an old tree. He grabbed the bark of the tree and scratched, scratched! Blood seeped from under his fingernails! He joined the army and the Party with this hatred. He didn't expect to hear these words again today, and these words were coming from his closest comrade-in-arms!

    Lao Wei was standing by the drilling machine, fuming, when he saw Lao Xia standing in front of him, covered in sweat and tears. He was stunned.

    For days, Lao Xia said little, working silently. Lao Wei panicked. One snowy night, Lao Xia went to the family members' team, and he chased after him, opening his heart, talking to him, exchanging hearts... Lao Xia extended those bloodied fingers to him, and the two hugged and cried.

    Yes, why couldn't he recognize his closest class brother standing right in front of him? Why couldn't he see that the entire working class was determined to remove the label of backwardness from the petroleum industry and to resolutely make revolution? I, Lao Wei, am willing to climb mountains of knives and brave seas of fire for the Party, but why can't I even be a good driller and squad leader?

    That night, he couldn't sleep. He took out *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* from under his pillow again. How many times had he picked up and put down this book! Now, each unfamiliar character and difficult word was like a dangerous peak blocking him and Chairman Mao. He asked, he looked up, and finally got over a small hurdle, as if he heard Chairman Mao's voice in the distance and saw Chairman Mao's figure. He started running, but was blocked by another "roadblock." A fire of hatred erupted from the bottom of his heart: "Was I born with the words 'illiterate' carved on my head, Wei Guangrong? Do you blood-sucking landlords and capitalists still want to blind my eyes for the rest of my life? Never mind a few roadblocks, I will cross even the Flaming Mountains! I want to see Chairman Mao! I want to hear his voice!"

    Our Lao Wei squeezed out every minute, placing a dictionary on his knees, holding the book in one hand and a pen in the other, opening a path through thorns, traveling through deep mountains and dense forests, step by step, step by step, getting closer to Chairman Mao's side!

    As soon as the book was opened! Every word, every sentence was so kind, so powerful, all words pulled from our hearts! All were supporting and paving the way for us workers and peasants! As the book turned, page after page! Look, poor peasants with "not a tile over their heads, not enough land to stick a needle" were surging in from all directions, thousands and thousands of them! Surging towards a red flag raised high! The flag bearer stood on the hilltop, his majestic figure, his familiar face, it was you, Chairman Mao! You said to us: "It's very good!" You said to China: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. To deny them is to deny the revolution." Chairman Mao, I heard your voice! As the book turned, page after page: Wei Guangrong seemed to be following Chairman Mao to Jinggang Mountain, on the Long March... undergoing layer after layer of revolutionary trials. He recalled resisting America and aiding Korea: those female medics carrying wounded soldiers on their backs, those comrades who shielded their comrades-in-arms with their bodies, those companies holding hands and wading through icy rivers... The flames of the petroleum battle blazed in his heart again: in the pouring rain, on dozens of drilling platforms lined up in a row, drillers fought side by side, people from all over the country, pouring their sweat on the oil field! In the heavy snow, comrades broke the ice to fetch water, and a basin filled with icy water was passed from hand to hand among hundreds of class brothers... Ah, my comrades-in-arms, my comrades, my entire proletariat!

      "I must have a conscious proletarian revolutionary spirit," Wei Guangrong concluded.

    In the past, when he got on the drilling platform, his eyes turned red, but his hands were not skilled. The drillers said: "When you go up to the drilling platform with Master Wei, you have to grow two eyes on the back of your head!" Now, he thought: "Can I win honor for the three red banners like this?" When he pondered it, the lives of the oil well, the equipment, and the drillers were all in his hands, and he couldn't help breaking into a cold sweat. He summarized the "three lives in the driller's hands" warning! This tough guy who never bowed his head now took off his hat and asked all comrades with technical strengths for advice, learning for the sake of the revolution! He said: "The knife for killing the enemy must be sharp, the revolutionary heart must be red, and the heart must be red and the skills must be high." His arms ached and his wrists hurt, but as long as he thought of the two-thirds of the world's class brothers who were still "sleeping in grass nests and wearing straw capes," what was this!

    In the past, he "only grabbed the drill bit, not the people's minds, and suffered bitterly." Now, he "grabs the people's minds first, then the drill bit, and tastes the sweetness." He also said: "Helping people requires helping their minds, helping their minds requires knowing their hearts, and knowing their hearts requires believing in them." The key lies in helping class brothers with class feelings.

    The outer wrench operator Lao Li got angry and submitted a resignation application. Lao Wei suppressed his anger and calmly thought: in the past, his views on him were rigid, he scolded him too much, and hurt his class brother's heart. Lao Li went to the hospital for treatment, and Lao Wei was busy with work, so he asked his wife to visit him, telling her: "He is our class brother, you don't recognize his face, but you are connected in your hearts!" The first two times, Lao Li saw her in the corridor, but didn't expect her to be looking for him, so he missed her. The third time, she put down their three-month-old child and came in the heavy wind and snow. After meeting, Lao Li looked at the snowflakes on her body, her frozen red cheeks, her warm eyes... and thought of that resignation application, and couldn't help but burst into tears on the bed...

    As she left, Lao Li stood by the window and saw the wind and snow lifting her hair and the corners of her clothes, and her feet stepping into and out of the snowdrifts. He felt that the wind and snow were stabbing into his heart, class sister!

    People suddenly felt that Wei Guangrong's team was very different. Lao Wei went to the drilling platform, and the drilling platform was still the same drilling platform, and the comrades were still the same comrades, but he felt that there was an indescribable change.

    That day, it was so cold that even the demons were grinning, and the "B" driller had something to do and left. It just so happened that they were raising and lowering the drill pipe, and Lao Wei had to work continuously for eight hours without blinking or moving. The captain came to replace him for dinner, but he refused. The second time, the captain brought heated-up food to the drilling platform and said: "If you don't trust my operation, just stand behind me and eat." He said: "I believe you, but the drilling platform is the battlefield, and the soldiers can't put down their weapons to eat, and I can't put down the brake handle to eat." The drillers listened to his words and responded: "Wherever you fight, we will follow!"

    It was late at night, and the cold air penetrated the leather hat and cotton clothes. Lao Xia brought the steam pipeline to wrap around the cold brake handle, but Lao Li blocked him with his body, letting the mud from the drill pipe spray all over himself. The comrades stared intently at his every gesture, dozens of arms and more than a dozen hearts united into one, fighting the stratum so sensitively and powerfully! A heat that he had never felt before burst out from Lao Wei's heart, and he felt that what was placed on the brake handle was not a palm, but the big hand of his entire class! He ripped off his leather hat, looked up, and saw the lights of Zhongnanhai shining down on him in the dark sky!

    My dear comrades, when you and thousands of comrades who shared life and death stepped across the smoky Yalu River bridge, when you were repairing river embankments in the storm, when you sang "The Internationale" in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, you may have felt that you had forgotten your body, your voice, your joys and sorrows, and had transformed into a cell of the revolutionary body, becoming a sound wave of the proletarian roar!

    My dear comrades, when you open Chairman Mao's works, and in that vivid and clear picture of class struggle, you clearly see your past, present, and future; when you encounter crossroads in your life, and you see the immortal image of Zhang Side in front of the blazing kiln fire; when you are confused by the dense fog and heavy rain of phenomena in the struggle against heaven and earth, and suddenly see the huge footprints of Chairman Mao; does the never-extinguished lamp of Zhongnanhai not also shine in your heart?

    Yes, the red flag belongs to the working people who created the world with axes and sickles, and Mao Zedong Thought belongs to the conscious revolutionaries! This is the secret of why hundreds of millions of people today are thirsting for Mao Zedong Thought!

    What are you saying about dragons entering the sea, what are you saying about the Kunpeng flying ten thousand miles, who knows how high and how far a conscious Mao Zedong warrior can fly! If you are willing to listen, Yao Jiangang, the driller next door who is putting on his work boots to go to work, can tell you a story.

    In 1958, this honest, strong, and burly child wanted to be a hero, so he left his middle peasant family and went to Yumen to become a driller. When he saw that this work was dirty and tiring, he wanted to learn how to operate a diesel engine, thinking that he would have a backup plan when he went home later. The old master gave him a copy of *Serve the People* and said: "Little devil, you have to work hard to transform your thinking!" He stiffened his neck, turned his face, and thought: "I grew up under the red flag, fed with revolutionary milk, what do I need to transform? Ridiculous!"

    Back in the dormitory, the more he thought about it, the more blocked he felt. He thought: Humph! In novels, petroleum workers are written as being so amazing, "leather boots, shiny aluminum helmets, wearing red flowers, roaming in all directions..." When you get to the well site, the mud covers the aluminum helmet and turns it into a mud ball, and the drilling platform is so crowded that you can't turn around. What's the point of this place? Can it produce any heroes? Asking me to study Mao Zedong's works, but there's nothing about petroleum written in it.

    Although he thought that way, he couldn't say it, since he volunteered to come! Just keep working. As he worked, he got used to it, got a taste for it, and understood a little. When he looked at *Serve the People* again, he was moved. In this way, he was elected as an advanced producer in 1959, which was considered the first hurdle he passed.

    In 1960, he arrived at the Daqing Oilfield, and wow, this was a real battlefield! Even if you had a hundred hands, you wouldn't have enough, and even if your shoulders could carry a big mountain, it wouldn't be enough. The young man looked at the heroes in their oil worker uniforms wearing red flowers riding horses across the stage at the ten-thousand-person meeting, and secretly swore in his heart. He worked hard and desperately chased after them. But in 1961, the environment became even more difficult. The young man's otitis media acted up again, and his mind started to wander again. Should he switch to a lighter job? The instructor said: "Why don't you ask Chairman Mao!" In his illness, he read *In Memory of Norman Bethune* over and over again. He found the root cause, which was "the heart of selfishness and self-interest"! But I'm only eighteen years old, where does so much selfishness come from? Maybe I haven't encountered Shangganling yet, but if I got to that point, I would be Huang Jiguang too!

    Then, a serious test was forced upon him! One day, the young man was working on a drilling platform more than twenty meters high, with white clouds around him and eagles at his feet. If he could free up his hands, he really wanted to sing a song... Suddenly, he heard a crack, and angle iron and screws fell down. He looked up and saw that the neck of the derrick was crooked, and the upper part of the derrick was swaying and bending over his head.

    Although no one on the well site was even scratched, and the derrick was quickly repaired and reinforced, the swaying derrick was still pressing on Xiao Yao's heart. But looking around, the masters were all acting as if nothing had happened... Yes, Wang Jinxi was able to disregard his seriously injured legs and throw away his crutches to jump into the mud pit to rescue the oil well. What about himself? At this time, Chairman Mao's words rang in his ears again: "Comrade Zhang Side died in the interests of the people, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai." Yes, why can't I be an old scalper for the people like Zhang Side for the rest of my life? Why can't I dedicate myself to the revolution without changing my face like Huang Jiguang? Huang Jiguang died, but he lives in my heart and the hearts of hundreds of millions of people; a deserter, even if he lives, is just a stinking piece of dead flesh! "I need to transform!" Xiao Yao realized this sentence painfully!

    He reached out and took out *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, lit a small oil lamp, and read it avidly, reading... "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with the mark of the class." He had read this passage many times, but today it jumped out at him, "class branding"!

    He remembered all kinds of instructions and exhortations he had heard at home, many tangible and intangible influences, and his tortuous path of progress after joining the workforce. What to do? Should he be the successor of middle peasant thought? Or a red-hearted and loyal proletarian fighter?

    Advance towards proletarianization! Xiao Yao found his own path! He was carrying out self-revolution! "I want to serve the people completely and thoroughly!" Completely, thoroughly! Does replacing the steel wire rope mean getting oil all over his face? Xiao Yao said: "In order to raise and lower the drill smoothly, I am willing to let my face be black every day, every year, black for the rest of my life! I want to be a successor with a black face and a red heart!" In winter, does retrieving sediment from the mud pit mean stepping in icy water? Jump into the pit! The ice shards cut his skin, and the operated abdomen throbbed. Should he go to the boiler room to warm up? No! Xiao Yao said: "As soon as I see that the mud is smooth again and the blood of the well is alive, I feel warm." When connecting the drill pipe, does the mud spray onto the driller? Every time, he blocked it with his own body! People who didn't know the inside story said: "Young man, why are you confused today?" Xiao Yao looked at the driller who was operating efficiently and smiled, smiling because he had become less confused! Did going home to visit relatives affect the drilling of ultra-deep wells? He was approved for four home visits, but he didn't go back! Did some comrades have ideological struggles? Bring *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* to help! Gradually, he understood Huang Jiguang's heart when he pounced on the bunker, and Zhang Side's roots, one step at a time!

    From the dormitory to the well site, on the small road that he walked several times a day, he felt that the road was becoming wider, fresher, and more meaningful! From the well site to the drilling platform, he climbed the ladder several times every day. In the past, he had felt that the drilling platform was narrow and ordinary, but now he said: "As long as you dedicate your youth to the country's drilling career, a very broad world will appear on the eight-meter-square drilling platform!" He stood on the drilling platform and only felt that the world in front of him was a world of sparks spreading, a China of red flags flying, and hundreds of millions of soldiers marching forward. He felt that every opening and closing of the big pliers in his hand and every activation of the drill pipe was a drumbeat in this magnificent march! After working as a driller for nearly ten years, today he clearly felt: This is revolution!

    One day, the drilling machine roared, and an iron mesh lampshade fell from a height of eighteen meters, hitting the driller's hand holding the brake handle! The hand immediately bled profusely. Loosening the brake handle would mean tens of tons of drilling tools losing control and sliding down from the sky, about to smash everything down, and in an instant, the well would be destroyed and people would die! Yao Jiangang jumped over without hesitation, pressing his whole body tightly on the brake handle. Perhaps, while he was running over, the drilling tools would crush him completely; but precisely because of his fearlessness, he grabbed the front of death! Precisely because he understood Huang Jiguang's heart, he could move forward in the footsteps of the hero!

    Well said, Yao Jiangang! "On the eight-meter-square drilling platform, a very broad world will appear!" Yes. For a conscious warrior of Mao Zedong, it is not only on the atomic bomb test site that takes the heights of science and technology, but also by the 12,000-ton water press, that there is such a magnificent battle. There is also an infinitely scenic peak, a lofty spiritual realm, and a very broad world in the narrow sales counter, the muddy paddy field, the small driver's seat, the pigsty that can't turn around, and the ping-pong table that is a "tuo" wide!

    In the army that raises the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high and advances towards proletarianization, this heroic oil field is just a sharp knife company in the ranks; this hard-bone drilling team and these comrades are just a drop in the ocean. Isn't it, as long as you look up, you will see the commune members with pipes in their mouths squatting on the edge of the fields and talking about "internal cause theory"; the workers are gathered around the lathe, reaching out their big hands covered with oil to find the main contradiction; the ping-pong players are reporting "and now stepping over from the beginning"; the driver is writing "dialectics in the cab" next to the steering wheel; the pilot is pointing to the map bag and talking about the revolutionary airflow direction...

    Look into the distance! Teams of female militiamen carry steel guns on their shoulders, singing "Chinese daughters have lofty aspirations," and walk towards the dawn! Tens of millions of young people sing "The Song of Lei Feng" and walk to the deserted islands and mountain villages where their predecessors shed their blood! Hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants read *Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan* with boiling blood! People clearly see that a revolutionary army that is unprecedentedly conscious in human history has appeared on China's vast land. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, raise the torch of revolutionary dialectics high, enter the tiger's den, break through difficulties, transform themselves, transform society, transform nature, and move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom! They are charging for the decisive battle of the two destinies in the world! People clearly hear that they are singing a new song that shakes the earth and opens a new era from different posts and in different languages—The Song of Mao Zedong!

    Editor's Note

    The new year has begun, and China's Third Five-Year Plan has begun.

    At the beginning of this new year, we recommend to readers an article and two paintings by writer Wei Gangyan and painter Shao Yu depicting the boiling scene of the Daqing Oilfield. With abundant revolutionary feelings, they introduce us to the advanced banner on the industrial front—Daqing—through the advanced deeds of several workers and some moving pictures. These works are an enthusiastic ode to the spirit of Daqing and an enthusiastic ode to Mao Zedong Thought.

    Daqing is a good example of China's self-reliance, hard work, hard struggle, and diligent construction, and a good example of implementing the Party's general line. After reading these works, people can see what kind of revolutionary spirit and heroic spirit the people of Daqing have! In Daqing, every oil field is flying the revolutionary red flag, and every derrick is shining with the light of battle.

    What force enables the people of Daqing to remove the backward label of China's petroleum industry at such a miraculous speed and with such astonishing standards? The workers of the Daqing Oilfield answered well: "We started with 'Two Theories'!" They worked hard to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible spiritual weapon, entered the tiger's den, broke through difficulties, and continued to discover, invent, create, and advance.

    At present, a revolutionary army that is unprecedentedly conscious in human history has appeared on China's vast land. They are the teams composed of thousands of Lei Fengs and Wang Jies, thousands of Dazhai people and Daqing people, and thousands of heroes from all walks of life. Under the leadership of the Party, this army will write the greatest poems in the history of the motherland and will also write magnificent poems in the history of mankind. Relying on this army, we will definitely be able to fulfill China's Third Five-Year Plan completely, and we will definitely be able to make even greater achievements in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. It is hoped that China's literary and artistic writers and the vast number of amateur workers, peasants, and soldiers will redouble their efforts in the new year, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and create more and better literary and artistic works that express our heroic era and our heroic people to meet the needs of our era and our people.

    Started with "Two Theories", Advanced with Two-Part Method Shao Yu Sketch
    —When the whole country was learning from Daqing, Daqing launched a mass movement to find shortcomings, and "dividing one into two" became a fighting philosophy that makes people mentally energetic and constantly advances. A modern refinery was built behind the mud houses
    —The mud houses are not just a material concept here, they are shining with the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people's hard work, hard struggle, self-reliance, and diligent construction; shining with the great revolutionary glory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛泽东之歌
    ——大庆书简
    魏钢焰亲爱的同志：
      已是晚上九点多了，你正在做什么？要是不太忙的话，随我到大庆油田走一趟吧！
    人常说，登高才能望远。干脆，咱们上那高高的井架上去开开眼。怎么样？够劲儿不？我敢说，哪怕是最冷静的人，看了这灿烂的灯海也会“哦呀”一声的。
    几年前，这儿还只是个青天一顶，荒原一片，帐篷点点，篝火丛丛的“战场”。如今，管它白宫主子的明枪封锁也罢，叛徒奴才的暗箭刁难也罢，我们的油田，硬是以神奇的速度、惊人的水平，光华四射地在地球上出现了！
      “这，是什么力量呢？”许多人向大庆油田的职工们提出这个问题。“我们是‘两论’起家的！”他们扳起那磨旧了的《毛泽东选集》说。乍听了，也许一下想不透。可只要你住久了，战斗了，就会懂得油田的每口油井，每座建筑，每寸管线，每条道路，还有那些巍然高耸的井架、炼塔、油罐，正是这个英雄队伍革命化的标志，学习了毛泽东思想获得的果实。
    就说我们站的这个井架吧，这下面正钻着一口超深井，地层岩屑硬得能划玻璃，而向它开火的，是比它还硬的硬骨头钻井队。在井场上，炊事员老裴刚放下饭挑，又蹲在那里守着一个用过的钻头琢磨开了。前两天，他给钻头攻关组写了一份改进意见书，感动得技术员们立刻向他送了决心书和感谢信。有人笑问他：“钻头和你这火头军有什么关系？”他说：“我是火头军，可我是革命的火头军，革命焦心的事，我就要管。”是这样的炊事员！
    在路上，有一对夫妇正“谈判”什么，女的是江苏口音：“大伙看我劳动好，这一批，评上咱家先住进新房子，你不也光荣么？明儿来吧，我在门口接你！”男的象是有点脸上挂不住：“那我不成了你的家属啦！”女的噗嗤笑了：“你呀，还学毛主席著作呢，这就叫转化呀！你们顶工业半个天，我们顶农业半个天，谁属谁呀？”是这样的家属！
    宿舍门口，上零点至八点班的职工，正坐着小板凳开会。一个学徒工带着童音说：“地层硬了正好。咱们专爱摸老虎屁股！山越高越有奔头，困难越大越有闯头，井越深才越有打头！战略上咱藐视几千米，战术上可要重视一公分。要学张师傅，他冰天雪地严守岗位捞砂子，叫他歇会儿，他说：‘泥浆槽就是火线，放走一粒砂子去磨损机器，就是放走一个敌人钻进革命阵营。’咱要的就是这股严劲狠劲！要不，算什么工人阶级？”是这样的钻工！
    他们，还不是这里的标兵，尖子，而他们对党和革命的感情，是那样深！他们的充满毛泽东思想的语言，句句都是发自内心的家常话。有这样的家属，这样的炊事员，这样的工人，怎么不出这样的油田！
    我曾经接待过一位好心的观察家，他常常对着我们那丰盛的菜摊肉市赞叹。他说：“我只对事实感兴趣。”临别，他说：“我亲眼看到挎菜篮的主妇，白头发的镟工，在书店排队争购《毛泽东著作选读》。我不理解，这本书究竟有种什么力量？为什么一个农村妇女能登台做《实践论》的哲学报告？为什么毛主席的语录能成为街头巷尾、车间田庄的生活语言？”
    这问题，还是请英雄油田的职工回答吧！
    还用往远处说么？就请你到这硬骨头井队的宿舍来看看吧，我来向你介绍一个人。对，就是那个披件外衣靠在床背上的人，他名叫魏光荣，是五好标兵，模范班长。如今，他正就着用报纸遮起的灯光，攻读毛主席著作咧。你看！他手里紧捏着书，拧着眉头，目光直视书页，有这样看书的么？
    这不是看书，不是念文章，按他的话说：“我这是爬山过海，去找毛主席！”
    要摸不清他的根底，就很难懂他这话。
    魏光荣，这个吃百家饭长大、以天地为家的孤儿，睡草窝盖蓑衣，被仇恨的火烧炼成的小长工，刚刚解放，就走进工作队住的大庙说：“我总算找到了家！”随着，就提了根棒子和地主斗上了。要捣乱么？他抡起棒子就干。工作队劝阻，他眉毛一立：“不打，还请他坐席？”他十六岁就当了民兵队长，十八岁抢头报名参军去抗美援朝，反正这条命和共产党拧在一起了。在炮声中他宣誓入党，在号召下转业搞石油。他一干活就眼红，管你张三李四，谁要不象他那样拼命干，登时就“训”。他一摸刹把劲就来，猛刹猛提，飞起飞下，井架都乱哆嗦。人们对他又爱又气，把他叫“魏老虎”。
    劝过，批评过，他也狠下过决心，要改正。可一上钻台眼又红了。恨不得一拳头砸出口井来啊！能叫反动派的手卡在咱脖子上么？
    前年冬天，天冷得伸不出手，钻工老夏钻进钻机去换刹带，正憋得浑身是汗，老魏在外边等急了，脱口喊道：“快出来，笨得象头猪！”这句话，象个炸雷轰在老夏的心上。这句话，老夏自十二岁到富农家放牛那天起，一直听了几年。草没割“够”：“懒猪”！牛脱缰了：“死猪”！一次，他被骂的牙咬得格格响，一扭身冲出大门，迎面遇到一棵老树，他一把狠狠抠住树皮，抠，抠！血，从指甲下渗了出来！他怀着这仇恨参军、入党，没想到，今天又听到这句话；而这句话，竟是出于自己最亲近的战友之口！
    老魏正站在钻机旁冒火，忽见老夏汗气腾腾、热泪长流地站在面前，他愣了。
    几天了，老夏少言不语，闷头干活。老魏慌啦。一个风雪交加的晚上，老夏回家属队去，他追了上去，向老夏交心，谈心，换心……老夏向他伸出了那流过血的指头，两个人抱住哭了。
    是啊，为啥亲亲的阶级弟兄站在眼皮下，自己硬认不清呢？为啥看不到要甩掉石油落后帽子的，要坚决革命的，是整个工人阶级？我老魏为了党，刀山愿上，火海敢闯，可为啥连个司钻和班长也当不好呢？
    晚上，他怎么也睡不着，从枕头下又取出了《毛泽东著作选读》。这本书，他曾拿起又放下多少回啊！如今，一个个生字，难词，象是座座险岭峻山横在他面前，挡着他和毛主席了。他问啊、查啊，好不容易闯过一个小坎子，仿佛远远地听见了毛主席的声音，看见了毛主席的身影，他迈腿就奔，可又被“拦路虎”挡住了。一股仇火从心底喷起：“我魏光荣一落地，头上就刻了文盲两个字么？你们这些吃人血的地主资本家，还想把我的眼睛蒙一辈子么？别说几个拦路虎，就是火焰山也要翻过去！我要见毛主席！我要听他的声音！”
    我们的老魏挤出了每一分钟，膝盖上摆本字典，一手捏书，一手持笔，在荆棘中开路，在深山密林里穿行，一步步，一步步走近毛主席的身边！
    书，一打开！每个字，每一句都是那么亲切、有劲，都是从咱心窝子掏出来的话！都是为咱工农兵撑腰开路的！书，一页页翻过！瞧啊，“上无片瓦，下无插针之地”的贫农，成千上万、四面八方地涌来了！向一面高高举起的红旗涌来了！那旗手立在山头上，雄伟的身影，熟悉的面孔，是您啊，毛主席！您对我们说：“好得很！”您向中国说“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。”毛主席啊，我听见了您的声音！书，一页页地翻过：魏光荣好象跟着毛主席上井冈山，去长征……经受着重重革命风霜。他回忆着抗美援朝：那些背着受伤战士的女卫生员，用身体掩护战友的同志，手挽手涉过冰河的连队……他心头又燃起石油大会战的烽火：瓢泼大雨里，在一字儿排开的几十座钻台上，并肩奋战的钻工们，来自五湖四海的人们，把汗水流在油田上！鹅毛大雪中，伙伴们破冰取水，一个盛满冰水的脸盆，在成百阶级弟兄的热手中传递……啊，我的战友，我的同志，我的整个无产阶级！
      “我要有自觉的无产阶级革命精神。”魏光荣得出了结论。
    过去，他上了钻台，眼红手不高，钻工们说：“跟魏师傅上钻台，屁股后头都得长两只眼睛！”现在，他想：“我这样能为三面红旗争光么？”一琢磨，油井、设备、钻工的命，全在自己手里捏着哩，不禁出了一身冷汗。他总结出了“司钻手里三条命”的警句！这个从不肯低头的硬汉子，如今，脱下帽来，向所有技术上有点长处的同志请教，为革命而学嘛！他说：“杀敌刀要快，革命心要红，心红艺要高。”练得胳膊肿，手腕疼，可只要想想世界上三分之二还在“睡草窝盖蓑衣”的阶级弟兄，这算什么！
    过去，“只抓钻头，不抓人头，吃了苦头”；现在，“先抓人头，再抓钻头，尝了甜头”。他又说：“帮人要帮心，帮心要知心，知心要相信。”关键在于以阶级感情帮助阶级弟兄。
    外钳工老李闹气递了份退职申请书。老魏压住心火，冷静一想：过去对他看法死，训的多，伤了阶级弟兄的心。老李去住医院治病，老魏工作忙，便叫爱人去探望，叮咛道：“他是咱的阶级弟兄，你不认得脸，可通着心咧！”头两次，老李在过道看见了她，想不到她是来找自己的，也没招呼，就错过了。第三次，她又放下才三个月的孩子，冒着大风雪来了。见面后，老李望着她身上的雪花，冻红的脸颊，热诚的目光……想起那份申请书，一下忍不住，便扑在床上哭了起来……
    她走了，老李站在窗边，看见风雪掀起她的头发，衣角，一双脚在雪窝中拔出踏进时，就觉得，这风雪直扎在自己心上，阶级姐妹啊！
    人们突然觉得魏光荣班大不同了。老魏走上钻台去，钻台还是那个钻台，同志还是那些同志，他却觉得有了种说不出的变化。
    这天，天冷得鬼龇牙，乙司钻有事走了，又正遇着起下钻杆，老魏要眼皮不眨、不动不挪地连着干八小时。队长过来换他去吃饭，他拒绝了。二次，队长又提着热过的饭上钻台说：“你要不放心我操作，就站在我背后吃。”他说：“我相信你，可钻台就是战场，战士不能放下武器去吃饭，我也不能放下刹把去吃饭。”钻工们听了他的话，呼应道：“你打到哪里，我们跟到哪里！”
    夜深了，冷气穿透皮帽、棉衣，老夏提来蒸气管线，要缠在冰冷的刹把上；老李用身子挡住他，让钻杆里的泥浆全喷在自己身上。同志们一个个凝神注视着他的每个手势，几十只手臂，十多颗心合成一体，那么灵敏有力地向地层战斗！一股从未觉到过的热劲从老魏心坎里喷出来，他觉得：放在刹把上的，不是一只手掌，而是自己整个阶级的大手！他一把揪下头上的皮帽，昂头望去，在那墨黑的天空，他看见，中南海的灯光向他射来！
    我亲爱的同志，当你和千万名生死与共的战友们，踏过硝烟漫漫的鸭绿江桥的时候，在暴风雨里修江堤的时候，在人民英雄纪念碑前唱起《国际歌》的时候，你也许曾觉得忘了自己的身体，自己的声音，自己的苦乐；而化作革命躯体的一个细胞，变作无产阶级吼声的一个音波！
    我亲爱的同志，当你打开毛主席著作，在那幅生动而鲜明的阶级斗争图画里，清晰地看到自己的过去、现在、未来的时候；在你遇到生活中的岔路，而看到熊熊窑火前张思德的不朽形象的时候；当你在向天向地斗争中被浓雾密雨的现象迷乱，而豁然看到了毛主席那巨大脚印的时候；你心中，不也闪射着中南海那盏不灭的灯么？
    对，红旗属于用斧头和镰刀开创世界的劳动人民，毛泽东思想属于自觉的革命者！这，就是今天亿万人民如饥似渴地追求毛泽东思想的秘密！
    说什么苍龙入海，说什么云鹏万里，谁知道一个自觉的毛泽东战士，他能飞得多高多远啊！如果你愿意听，隔壁那个正在穿工靴要去上班的钻工姚建刚，他就能告诉你一段故事。
    一九五八年，这个憨厚好强、个头魁梧的孩子，一心想当英雄，离开自己的中农家庭，到玉门当钻工。他一看这活又脏又累，就要学开柴油机，心想以后回家也有个后手。老师傅给了他一本《为人民服务》说：“小鬼，要努力改造思想咧！”他脖子一梗，脸一扭，心说：“我红旗下长大，革命奶水喂饱，还改造什么？可笑！”
    回到宿舍越想越堵得慌。他想：哼！小说里把石油工人写得好神气，“牛皮靴，亮铝盔，戴红花，闯四方……”到井场一看，泥浆把铝盔糊成了个泥蛋，钻台上挤的转不过身来，这地方有什么意思？能出什么英雄？叫我学毛主席著作，这上头又没写石油的事儿。
    心虽那么想，话可说不出来，自愿来的呀！跟着干吧。干着干着也习惯了，有味了，懂点事了。再看《为人民服务》，他被感动了。这样，一九五九年当选了先进生产者，算闯了第一关。
    一九六○年，到了大庆油田，喝，这才叫战场呢！你就是浑身长一百双手也不嫌多，双肩能扛座大山也不够用。小伙子望着一个个油工服上戴红花的英雄们，骑着大马在万人大会上走过时，心中也暗暗发下誓言。他甩开膀子，猛跑狠追地恶战了一通。可一到一九六一年，环境更艰苦了。小伙子的中耳炎又犯了，脑子里又打开架了，是不是调换个轻便工作呢？指导员说：“你问问毛主席去！”病中，他一遍一遍地读《纪念白求恩》。根子找到了，是“自私自利之心”！可我一个才十八岁的人，哪儿那么多自私心呢？大概是没遇到上甘岭吧，要到了那节骨眼儿，我也会当黄继光的！
    接着一场严重的考验逼上来了！一天，小伙子正在二十几米高的井架平台上工作，白云在身边，苍鹰在脚下，要能腾开手啊，真想唱个歌儿……忽听，咔嚓一声，角铁、螺丝，撒了下来。他抬头看，井架的脖子歪了，井架上部颤悠悠地在他头上弯压着。
    尽管井场上没一个人蹭了皮，井架也很快修复加固了，但那颤悠悠的井架仍压在小姚的心上，可向四周看，师傅们一个个没事人似的……是啊，王铁人为了抢救油井能不顾重伤的腿脚，丢掉拐杖跳下泥浆池，自己呢？这时，毛主席的话又在耳边响了：“张思德同志是为人民利益而死的，他的死是比泰山还要重的。”是啊，自己为啥不能象张思德那样当一辈子老黄牛？为啥不能象黄继光那样面不改色地献身革命？黄继光死了，却活在我和亿万人的心里；一个逃兵活着，还不是一块发臭的死肉么？“我需要改造！”小姚痛悟了这句话！
    他一伸手，把《毛泽东选集》拿出来，点起了小油灯，如饥似渴地读着，读着……“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”。这段话，他读过很多次，今天却跳了出来，“阶级烙印”！
    他记起了在家中听到的各种嘱咐和训示，许多有形无形的影响，参加工作后的曲折前进道路，怎么办？是做中农思想的继承者？还是做赤胆忠心的无产阶级战士？
    向无产阶级化前进！小姚找到了自己的路！他进行着自我革命！“我要完全彻底地为人民服务！”要完全，要彻底！排钢丝绳要甩一脸油么？小姚说：“为了起下钻顺利，我愿意让脸天天黑，年年黑，黑它一辈子！我要做脸黑心红的接班人！”冬天在泥浆池捞沉砂要踩冰水么？跳下池子去！冰碴划破了肉皮，开过刀的腹部阵阵隐痛，去锅炉房暖暖？不！小姚说：“我一看到泥浆又畅通了，钻井的血脉活了，我就暖和了。”接钻杆的时候，泥浆往司钻身上喷么？每一次，他都用自己的身体去挡！不知内情的人说：“小伙子，今儿怎么糊涂啦？”小姚望了望正利洒操作的司钻笑了，为自己变得不糊涂而笑了！回家探亲影响打超深井么？批准了四次探亲假，他也不回！有的同志思想打架么？带上毛主席著作去帮！渐渐地，他懂得了黄继光扑碉堡时的心，张思德一步一个脚印的根！
    从宿舍到井场，在一天要走几次的小路上，他觉得道路越来越广阔，越新鲜，越有意义！从井场到钻台，每天都要登几次扶梯，过去，他曾觉得钻台狭小平凡，现在他说：“只要把青春献给祖国的钻井事业，在八米见方的钻台上，就会出现一个非常广阔的天地！”他站在钻台上，只觉得，眼前是星火燎原的世界，红旗飞扬的中国，大步迈进的亿万雄兵。他觉得手中每一次大钳的开合，每一根钻杆的起动，都是这雄伟进军中的一个鼓点！干了近十年钻工，今天才鲜明感到：这，就是革命！
    一天，钻机轰鸣，一个铁网灯罩从十八米的高空震落下来，正巧砸在司钻扶着刹把的手上！这手，顿时鲜血直流，松了刹把，几十吨重的钻具失去操纵，嗤嗤溜溜从高空向下滑着，眼看就要全砸下来，一刹时，就会井毁人亡！小姚义无反顾地跳了过去，全身紧紧按在刹把上。也许，就在他奔去的路上，钻具就整个压了下来；但正因为他的无畏，就抢到了死亡的前面！正因为他懂得了黄继光的心，就能踏着英雄的脚印前进！
    说的好啊，姚建刚！“在八米见方的钻台上，就会出现一个非常广阔的天地！”对。对一个自觉的毛泽东的战士来说，岂止在攻取科学技术高峰的原子弹试验场上，一万二千吨的水压机旁，有那样壮丽的战斗。就是那狭窄的售货台，泥污的稻田，小小的驾驶室，转不过身的猪圈，一庹宽的乒乓球台，都有个风光无限的高峰，崇高的精神境界，非常广阔的天地！
    在高举毛泽东思想红旗，向无产阶级化前进的大军中，这个英雄油田，只是行列中的一个尖刀连；这个硬骨头井队，这几位同志只是大海中的一滴罢了。不是么，你只要抬起头来，就会看到叼根烟袋的公社社员蹲在田埂上大谈“内因论”；工人们围在车床边，伸出沾满机油的大手寻找主要矛盾；乒乓球选手正报告“而今迈步从头越”；司机在方向盘旁写“驾驶室里的辩证法”；飞行员指着图囊谈革命的气流方向……
    向远处看看吧！队队女民兵肩扛钢枪，唱着“中华儿女多奇志”，迎着曙光走去！几千万青年唱着《雷锋之歌》走上前辈们洒过热血的荒岛、山村！亿万贫下中农热血沸腾地读着《湖南农民运动考察报告》！人们清晰地看到，在中国广大的土地上，出现了一支人类历史上空前自觉的革命大军。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，高举革命辩证法的火把，入虎穴，闯难关，改造自己，改造社会，改造自然，从必然王国向自由王国前进！为世界上两种命运的决战而冲锋！人们清晰地听到，他们从不同的岗位，用不同的语言，高唱着一支震撼天地的划时代的新歌——毛泽东之歌！

    编者的话
    新的一年开始了，我国的第三个五年计划开始了。
    在这新年之初，我们向读者推荐作家魏钢焰和画家邵宇描绘大庆油田沸腾景象的一篇文章和两幅画。他们以充沛的革命感情，通过几位工人的先进事迹和一些动人的画面，向我们介绍了工业战线上的先进旗帜——大庆。这些作品是对大庆精神的热情颂歌，是对毛泽东思想的热情颂歌。
    大庆，是我国自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的好典型，是贯彻党的总路线的好榜样。读了这些作品，人们可以看到，大庆人具有何等的革命精神，何等的英雄气概！在大庆，每一块油田都飘扬着革命的红旗，每一个井架都闪耀着战斗的光辉。
    是什么力量使大庆人能以如此神奇的速度、惊人的水平，脱掉我国石油落后的帽子呢？大庆油田的工人回答得好：“我们是靠‘两论’起家的！”他们努力学习和运用了毛泽东思想这个攻无不克的精神武器，入虎穴，闯难关，不断有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    目前，在我国广大的土地上，出现了一支人类历史上空前自觉的革命大军，他们是千千万万个雷锋、王杰，千千万万个大寨人、大庆人，和各行各业的千千万万英雄组成的队伍。这支队伍，在党的领导下，将写下祖国历史上最伟大的诗篇，也将写下人类历史上壮丽的诗篇。依靠这支队伍，我们一定能完满地实现我国的第三个五年计划，一定能使我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得更加伟大的成就。希望我国的文艺作家和广大的工农兵业余作者，在新的一年里，加倍努力，高举毛泽东文艺思想的伟大红旗，创造出更多更好表现我们英雄时代和英雄人民的文艺作品，以满足我们时代和我们人民的需要。（附图片）
    “两论”起家，两分法前进  邵宇　速写
    ——当全国到处学习大庆的时候，大庆开展了群众性的找差距运动，“一分为二”成为使人们精神奋发，不断前进的战斗哲学。在土房子后面兴建起现代化的炼油厂
    ——土房子，在这里不只是一个物质的概念，它闪烁着中国人民艰苦奋斗、奋发图强、自力更生、勤俭建国的革命精神；闪烁着毛泽东思想伟大的革命光辉。
