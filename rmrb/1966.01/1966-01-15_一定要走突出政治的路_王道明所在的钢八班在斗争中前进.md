    Editor's Note: "Giving prominence to politics" is the road that army building must take, and it is also the road that industry, agriculture, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, in short, all construction undertakings must take. We recommend the article "Must Take the Road of Giving Prominence to Politics" to our readers, hoping that everyone will read it carefully and think seriously about whether they have taken the road of giving prominence to politics. If you have already paid attention, how can you do better? If you haven't paid attention yet, how should you catch up?
    Below is the editor's note written by the *Liberation Army Daily* when it published this article:
    This article introduces a period of the Steel Eighth Platoon's journey on the road of giving prominence to politics.
    A platoon is a small cell within the large collective of our army. From this small cell, we can clearly see how immense the power of giving prominence to politics is! How powerful the force is once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses! In just one year, the spiritual outlook of Wang Daoming and the Eighth Platoon's soldiers underwent fundamental changes. Nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, their proletarian consciousness is higher than ever, their hearts are more united than ever, their morale is higher than ever, their work is better than ever, and their tactical skills are improving faster than ever. In this way, giving prominence to politics and doing a good job in ideological work will definitely be able to withstand various tests in peacetime, and will definitely be able to crush the enemy to pieces in wartime!
    Chairman Mao's military thinking has always placed politics first, with politics leading the military and commanding the military. The greatest combat power of our army is not airplanes, not tanks, but people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and not afraid of death. What's the use of even the best weapons and technology if people aren't brave and run away when the enemy comes!? Therefore, a spirit of bravery is more important than accurate shooting. We must take politics as the commander and the soul, and greatly emphasize politics, so that Mao Zedong Thought becomes the red sun in the hearts of every cadre and soldier, so that our cadres and soldiers have the highest revolutionary ideals, the deepest class hatred, and the strongest fighting will. Only then can we overwhelm all enemies in battle, charge when we need to charge, and defend when we need to defend. Only then can we give full play to the maximum effectiveness of tactical skills.
    Let us learn from the experience of the Steel Eighth Platoon, stride forward valiantly on the road of giving prominence to politics!
    The young platoon leader Comrade Wang Daoming's "Talking About Bayonet Practice" stirred the hearts of many readers. The phrase "Use bayonets to defeat atomic bombs" expresses the revolutionary heroic spirit of revolutionary soldiers. Some say that the bayonets of the Steel Eighth Platoon have politics on their tips. This is indeed the case. This article is the result of the Steel Eighth Platoon reversing the tendency to downplay politics and firmly emphasizing politics. The great Mao Zedong Thought armed their minds and gave them infinite wisdom and strength!

The Evil Path of Emphasizing Technology and Neglecting Politics Cannot Be Taken
    The road of the Steel Eighth Platoon giving prominence to politics was not smooth sailing. In 1964, they took a detour. At that time, the Steel Eighth Platoon was a famous "elite platoon" in military technology. They had given demonstration performances for many units, traveling all over the country and gaining a wide reputation. They had simply become the tip of the pagoda! Some soldiers of the Eighth Platoon also thought that with technology, they had everything. They usually thought about technology and practiced technology. They were not concerned enough about political study and neglected ideological remolding. The more obvious example was the veteran soldier Li Yingdao. In terms of shooting skills, he was a national second-level athlete; he could throw a grenade over fifty meters; and in bayonet fighting, it was difficult to find an opponent in the platoon. He usually practiced technology with great enthusiasm, but he was not concerned about political study. He often joked to the comrades in the platoon: "You are 'too soft,' and I am 'too hard.' You can do more public service duties, and I'll go when there are training performances!" There were also some comrades in the Eighth Platoon who were skilled in one area of technology, but had many ideological problems. Arguing and sulking among comrades were common. They also looked down on other platoons. People said: "The Eighth Platoon's technology is excellent, but their ideology is not." Some also said: "The Eighth Platoon has two sharp points, a sharp point in technology and a sharp point in ideological problems." When evaluating "Four Goods," no one raised their hand for the Eighth Platoon.
    A sharp question was placed before people: What kind of soldiers do we want to cultivate? Can you be considered to have combat power if you only have technology? In some people's view, the Eighth Platoon was very combat-effective; however, from the perspective of Chairman Mao's military thinking, from the perspective of the proletariat's political viewpoint, and from the perspective of the Eighth Platoon's fundamental situation, their combat power had not increased, but had been seriously weakened. This road could no longer be taken!

Reversing the Bias Starts with Reversing Thought
    In early 1965, Comrade Lin Biao gave extremely important instructions on the work of the troops, emphasizing that politics must be given prominence. Comrade Lin Biao said that Chairman Mao has always taught us that politics is the commander, the soul, and political work is the lifeline of our army. The construction of our army has always placed political construction in the primary position. We must give prominence to politics, so that political and ideological work truly becomes the foundation of our overall work. Wang Daoming, who had just become the platoon leader, felt that Comrade Lin Biao was standing in the company, standing in front of them, pointing out a broad road for them. The comrades in the platoon also said: "Our platoon only engages in technology and does not grasp ideology, and has gone astray!" "If everyone has their own ideas in peacetime, how can we strike at one point in wartime?" However, some individual comrades suggested: "As long as the technology is excellent, there is no need to worry about not being able to win a battle." "Our Steel Eighth Platoon is tough, and mainly relies on technology to make a living."
    Does fighting primarily rely on politics or primarily on technology? Should we emphasize politics or emphasize technology? The two opinions were diametrically opposed, and debate was unavoidable. According to the instructions of the Party branch, Wang Daoming simply let everyone open their minds and debate the issue until it was completely clear.
    At the discussion, many comrades said that our Steel Eighth Platoon, Red Third Company, and all the companies and platoons of the entire army, in the past, didn't we defeat the enemy's foreign guns and cannons with spears and lances, and defeat the enemy's planes and tanks with millet and rifles! Some comrades also said that the people of South Vietnam still make the American robbers suffer with bamboo stakes and traps! All of this shows that fighting mainly relies on proletarian politics and the consciousness of the people.
    They not only talked about the past and others, but also talked about the present and themselves. Wang Daoming spoke about his personal experience. At the end of 1963, he was transferred from the guard platoon of the regiment headquarters to the Eighth Platoon of the Third Company as a soldier. At that time, he was far behind the veteran soldiers of the Eighth Platoon in military technology. For a period of time, he only focused on practicing technology hard, crawling around all day long, crawling until the cotton batting of his cotton clothes was exposed, and practicing until his arms and legs were swollen and sore, finally improving his technology. However, he still couldn't pass the test at the crucial moment. In March 1964, during a live-fire tactical exercise, just as the grenade he threw exploded in the distance, the platoon leader ordered him to take the opportunity to charge. He hesitated. Everyone encouraged him to charge forward, but he still didn't dare to go up, and just spun around in place. After this happened, he couldn't sleep well for several nights in a row. He restudied the heroic deeds of Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, and other heroes, and believed that the gap between himself and these heroes was not military technology, but mainly that his political ideology was not as good as theirs, and he lacked the bravery and the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice of a revolutionary soldier. Wang Daoming used this incident to illustrate a fundamental truth spoken by Comrade Lin Biao: if political ideology cannot pass the test, you will run backwards during battle, and even the best military technology will be useless!
    The debate became more and more heated. Someone suggested: "If I don't emphasize politics, I can still hit a ten ring." Many comrades retorted that some people only compete for personal fame and gain in order to achieve results and learn technology, and they can also hit a ten ring, but hitting one more ten ring also means carrying one more ideological burden; the more ten rings, the heavier the burden.
    A lamp won't shine if it's not turned up, and a principle won't be clear if it's not debated. In this way, the Eighth Platoon, one sentence from you, one sentence from me, went through a long period of debate, and increasingly recognized the importance of emphasizing politics. Finally, Wang Daoming concluded: "To maintain and develop the honor of the Steel Eighth Platoon, and to be truly excellent on the battlefield, we must take the road of giving prominence to politics, and the Steel Eighth Platoon must be 'steel' in Mao Zedong Thought!"
    How to give prominence to politics? How to reverse the platoon's tendency to emphasize technology and neglect politics? Wang Daoming felt that the key was to first do a good job of working with the deputy platoon leader, Li Yingdao. From then on, he often helped Li Yingdao study Chairman Mao's works, and often had heart-to-heart talks with Li Yingdao. One day, Wang Daoming specially brought Xu Yinsheng's article "On How to Play Table Tennis" to the shooting practice range, and during a break, he studied it with Li Yingdao. When Li Yingdao was reading with enthusiasm, Wang Daoming said: "Look at others, every time they hit a ball, they think of winning glory for the motherland, they think of serving the people. Do we think like this every time we aim a shot or throw a grenade?" Wang Daoming's question caused Li Yingdao's mind to churn: What did I think about when I practiced technology in the past? Was I practicing to defend the motherland, or was I practicing for personal glory?
    After a period of ideological struggle, Li Yingdao said to Wang Daoming: I used to think more about personal matters when practicing technology, and less about serving the people. But we still have to rely on technology in battle, and if our ideology is good but our technology isn't excellent, we still can't eliminate the enemy. Wang Daoming felt that this was precisely the focus of Li Yingdao's vague understanding. If this problem wasn't resolved, his viewpoint of emphasizing technology and neglecting politics would be difficult to reverse. Wang Daoming reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander and the soul with him, and listed many heroic models and movie stories, and talked with Li Yingdao again and again.
    Is it true that if our ideology is good but we don't have excellent technology, we can't eliminate the enemy? Wang Daoming said to Li Yingdao: "I don't think that's the case. Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang were able to perform such heroic acts not because they had superb technology, but mainly because they had excellent ideology. I think Dong Cunrui didn't practice the action of holding explosives aloft, and Huang Jiguang didn't practice the action of using his body to block a gun, but at the critical moment, they were able to perform great actions and exchange their lives for victory in battle."
    Is it true that we can win a battle if we only have excellent technology? Wang Daoming gave an example from the movie *Steel Soldier*. He asked Li Yingdao: "What do you think of Qi Degui's bayonet skills in the movie?"
     "I think his bayonet defense skills are good!" Li Yingdao replied.
    Wang Daoming said: "Don't look at how good he is at bayonet fighting. Because he was afraid of death, he later became a shameful traitor!"
    The examples Wang Daoming gave forcefully demonstrated that military technology is one of the important factors of combat power, but it is not the fundamental factor. The fundamental factor is the power of politics. Li Yingdao was greatly inspired by listening to this, and looked at Wang Daoming with grateful eyes and said: "This time you have hit my vital point, I am convinced!"
    Li Yingdao's transformation and progress greatly promoted the Steel Eighth Platoon's emphasis on politics. Last September, when Wang Daoming was away on official business, Li Yingdao actively organized everyone to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, used politics to command the military, and used ideology to drive technology, targeting the platoon's active thinking. All three live-fire shooting exercises went well. The soldiers happily said: "The deputy platoon leader has changed, he can grasp technology and even more so he can grasp ideology!" The battalion commander also praised Li Yingdao as a "deputy platoon leader who gives prominence to politics" when summarizing this training.
    Li Yingdao tasted the sweetness of emphasizing politics and also suffered the bitterness of not emphasizing politics. He said with deep feeling: "Now I truly understand that practicing technology for personal gain can only serve the individual; with the idea of serving the people, the technology we practice can truly serve the people!" He often used these personal experiences to educate the soldiers in the platoon. He and Wang Daoming worked together to reverse the Eighth Platoon's tendency to emphasize technology and neglect politics.

Let Mao Zedong Thought Become the Red Sun in the Hearts of Soldiers
    Reversing the tendency to emphasize technology and neglect politics only cleared the way for emphasizing politics. To greatly emphasize politics, we must truly make Mao Zedong Thought the red sun in the hearts of every soldier. We must create a strong atmosphere in the entire platoon of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, raise the proletarian consciousness to a high level, deepen the hatred for class enemies, boost morale, and improve unity. This is the fundamental of fundamentals, the foundation of all victories.
    For a period of time, the most prominent problem in the Eighth Platoon was that the unity within and outside the platoon was not good enough. Within a week, they had argued with comrades from other platoons six times. Wang Daoming, with this problem in mind, studied Chairman Mao's discussions on strengthening unity and criticism and self-criticism with the soldiers, and focused on studying a passage spoken by Chairman Mao at the meeting of labor heroes and model workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Chairman Mao said: "You have many strengths and great achievements, but you must remember not to be proud." "If you become proud, not humble, no longer work hard, and do not respect others, do not respect cadres, and do not respect the masses, you will not be able to become heroes and models." This study caused a great shock. Everyone said: We used to think that we had explosive tempers when we argued with others. Now it seems that we are proud. Wang Daoming immediately followed up and said: "Good! Since we know we are wrong, we will apologize to them tomorrow." Some soldiers refused to apologize when they heard this. They said: "It's not all our fault, isn't apologizing a loss?" Wang Daoming said: "Going to apologize doesn't mean we are all wrong, it's admitting the part we are wrong about. Admit as much as we are wrong." Encouraged by Wang Daoming, six soldiers went to apologize separately. Before they could finish speaking, the others quickly took responsibility. The soldiers came back and said in unison: "Publicly admitting shortcomings is not a bad thing, it's a great thing. Doing it according to Chairman Mao's instructions is correct!" From then on, the Steel Eighth Platoon seized on the criticism and self-criticism and repeatedly studied it and repeatedly used it, establishing a combat style of daring to criticize and being happy to accept criticism in many ways.
    The Steel Eighth Platoon studied and used Chairman Mao's teachings on classes and class struggle the most. They also deepened their understanding of the current domestic and international class struggle situation by reading newspapers, talking about family histories, visiting enemy situation exhibitions, and inviting family members of the team to report, fundamentally raising their proletarian consciousness. Once, after the company commander, Wei Fulin, visited the "Ten Thousand People Pit" in the Liaoyuan mining area, he introduced the history of the blood and tears of the workers in the Liaoyuan coal mine before liberation to the entire company. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the miners lived a hellish life. In five years, more than 16,000 workers were tortured to death and buried in a mass grave, which people sadly called the "Ten Thousand People Pit." When Company Commander Wei visited, he saw with his own eyes that some of the bones were still wearing iron wires, and some of the bones were charred black. The comrades of the Eighth Platoon couldn't eat after hearing the company commander's report. They linked their own painful family history with the tragic history of the workers in the Liaoyuan coal mine, and said in unison: The imperialists and reactionaries owe the Chinese people too many blood debts! The entire platoon used this incident to discuss the question: Have the roots of suffering of the working people been dug out? Is there still class and class struggle today? Some said: The roots of the class have long been dug out, only the roots of suffering have not been dug out, and what is left is a rotten root. Wang Daoming and most of the comrades disagreed with this view. They studied Chairman Mao's quotations on the existence of class and class struggle throughout the entire socialist historical period and on the international scale, and everyone said excitedly: "Don't just see that we have turned ourselves over, there are still vast numbers of working people in the world living a tragic life like the Liaoyuan miners in the past. Now, the root cause of all the suffering of the working people in the world—imperialism—has not been dug out. To say that the roots of the class have been dug out, we can throw away our yellow military uniforms!"
    This study enabled the soldiers of the entire platoon to associate the suffering of the coal miners and the suffering of their own families with the suffering of the working people around the world who have not yet been liberated. Everyone further realized that the fate of the Chinese people is inseparable from the fate of the people of the world. It is the most glorious thing to contribute everything, even life, to the magnificent cause of the liberation of the entire class and the liberation of mankind.
    They also followed Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people completely and thoroughly, and in their daily work and life, they firmly grasped the promotion of proletarian ideology and the elimination of bourgeois ideology, and consciously fought against all personal selfishness and impurities. Wang Daoming deeply felt from studying Chairman Mao's works that every word of Chairman Mao was teaching us to wholeheartedly serve the people and to fight against the selfish impurities of individualism. Thinking about the platoon he led, did he have any selfish impurities? Some comrades often couldn't understand when personal interests conflicted with collective interests; some comrades attributed achievements to themselves and blamed others for setbacks; and even some comrades felt that they had "lost out" if they ate a little less. He thought: If a person is so concerned about personal life trivia in peacetime, how can he use his own life to exchange victory for the whole in wartime! This is how they looked at the roots from small things, looked at the essence from the phenomena, and looked at the future from the present, digging out selfishness bit by bit in daily life and cultivating collectivist thought. Once, a new soldier, Wang Zhuotang, suggested that the entire platoon go to the regimental auditorium to wipe the light bulbs. Wang Daoming felt very strange. Wang Zhuotang was relatively tall, and the light bulbs in the dormitory almost touched his head, and he didn't even want to wipe them clean, so why did he suddenly take the initiative to go to the regimental headquarters to wipe the light bulbs? Did he want the regimental leaders to praise the Eighth Platoon? The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was something to it. If we don't wipe our heads clean first, we can't wipe the light bulbs clean. He talked to Wang Zhuotang, and it was indeed the case. At the platoon meeting, Wang Zhuotang used his own personal experience to explain that if you do good deeds with selfishness, you will not only fail to overcome selfishness, but selfishness will become heavier and heavier. This matter was small, but it was a profound education for the entire platoon. Everyone deeply felt that selfishness can be cultivated unknowingly, but it will not be removed unknowingly. Wang Daoming was strict with the soldiers and even stricter with himself. He always put the collective first, then the individual, endured hardship first, and enjoyed pleasure later. At mealtimes, if there were both coarse grains and fine grains at the same time, he always competed to eat coarse grains and left the fine grains for other comrades to eat. Most of his allowances were used for public affairs or for others. Sometimes he wanted to send some money home, but when the families of other comrades encountered difficulties, he unreservedly sent the money he had saved to the families of his comrades. In this way, Wang Daoming led the comrades of the entire platoon to consciously and repeatedly fight against selfish impurities, so that the entire platoon had fewer and fewer individualistic thoughts and more and more collectivist thoughts, and the unity became better and better.
    With fewer selfish impurities, people's character becomes higher, and the determination to dedicate oneself to the revolutionary cause becomes greater. In an emergency task of extinguishing a mountain fire, the comrades of the Steel Eighth Platoon fully demonstrated the noble qualities of sacrificing their lives for the interests of the people. One evening, just after the Red Third Company arrived at the campsite, it suddenly received an order from its superiors: immediately go to a certain place to extinguish a mountain fire. Regardless of fatigue, all the cadres and soldiers of the company quickly rushed to the fire site. At that time, it was dark and windy, and the mountain fire was burning more and more fiercely. Clusters of thick smoke and raging fire spread everywhere, and the flames, which were more than ten feet high, were swept around by the whirlwind. At this critical moment, under the command and leadership of the company leaders, the comrades of the Eighth Platoon bravely threw themselves into the fire extinguishing battle. In order to reduce the loss of people's property, the comrades of the Eighth Platoon were not afraid of smoke and fire, and put their personal safety aside. They rushed wherever the fire went; when the tree branches were broken, they jumped into the fire pile and stomped and stomped hard with their feet. In the nine-hour fire extinguishing battle, Wang Daoming and the Eighth Platoon he led always charged ahead and did the work first. On the way back from extinguishing the fire, the grassland was sparsely populated, and housing and food were relatively difficult. The Eighth Platoon treated the comrades of the brother platoons with the greatest class love. The houses were crowded, so they gave the heated kang to the brother platoons to sleep on, and all the comrades of the platoon took the initiative to stand guard outside; when the Third Platoon ran out of the dry food they had brought, the Eighth Platoon gave all the steamed buns they had saved to the Third Platoon. They truly did what they were told to do, charging ahead and retreating behind, enduring hardship first and enjoying pleasure later, excellently passing the test of the sea of fire, and winning the collective second-class merit. The Eighth Platoon truly became a steel Eighth Platoon that was excellent in politics, ideology, and style!
    Excellent because of Mao Zedong Thought, smart because of Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party branch, Wang Daoming and the Steel Eighth Platoon he led have been advancing by leaps and bounds along the broad road of emphasizing politics through constant struggle. The past view of emphasizing technology and neglecting politics, those personal selfish impurities, have been constantly swept away like dust. The Steel Eighth Platoon, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is like a small "steelmaking furnace," smelting every soldier into steel. At the end of 1965, four more excellent soldiers of this platoon gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. All of this fully demonstrates the great power of emphasizing politics. The comrades of the Steel Eighth Platoon said, the comrades of the company said, and all the comrades who know about the progress of the Eighth Platoon also said that this road of emphasizing politics is completely the right path!

### 一定要走突出政治的路——王道明所在的钢八班在斗争中前进

    一定要走突出政治的路
    ——王道明所在的钢八班在斗争中前进
    编者按：“突出政治”，这是军队建设一定要走的路，也是工业、农业、商业、文化教育事业，总之，一切建设事业一定要走的路。我们向读者推荐《一定要走突出政治的路》这篇文章，希望大家好好读一读，认真想一想：自己是不是走了突出政治的路？如果已经注意了，怎样作得更好？如果还没有注意，应该怎样跟上来？
    下面是《解放军报》发表这篇文章的时候写的编者按语：
    这篇文章，介绍了钢八班在突出政治的道路上，走过的一段历程。
    一个班，在我们军队的大集体里，是个小小的细胞。从这个小小的细胞，可以清楚地看到：突出政治有多么巨大的威力！毛泽东思想一旦为群众掌握产生了多么强大的力量！仅仅一年的工夫，王道明和八班战士的精神面貌，就发生了根本的变化。在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，他们的无产阶级觉悟比任何时候都高，心比任何时候都齐，士气比任何时候鼓得都足，工作比任何时候做得都好，战术技术比任何时候提高得都快。这样，突出政治，做好人的思想工作，平时就一定能够经得住各种考验，战时就一定能够把敌人捶得粉碎！
    毛主席的建军思想，历来都是把政治摆在第一位，政治领导军事，统帅军事。我军最大的战斗力，不是飞机，不是坦克，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。打仗的时候，人不勇敢，敌人来了向后跑，再好的武器和技术有什么用！？因此，勇敢精神比射击打得准更重要。我们必须以政治为统帅，为灵魂，把政治大大突出起来，让毛泽东思想成为每个干部战士心中的红太阳，使我们的干部战士，都有最高的革命理想，最深的阶级仇恨，最旺盛的战斗意志。打起仗来，才能压倒一切敌人，冲就冲得上，守就守得住。才能充分发挥战术技术的最大效能。
    让我们吸取钢八班的经验，在突出政治的道路上，昂首阔步，奋勇前进！
    年青的班长王道明同志的《谈谈练刺杀》，激动了广大读者的心。“用拼刺刀打败原子弹”这句话，表达了革命战士的革命英雄气概。有人说，钢八班的刺刀尖上有政治。的确是这样。这篇文章，是钢八班扭转轻政治的偏向、坚定突出政治的结果。伟大的毛泽东思想武装了他们的头脑，给了他们无穷的智慧和力量！重技术轻政治的邪路走不得
    钢八班走突出政治的路，并不是一帆风顺的。一九六四年他们曾经走了弯路。那时候，钢八班在军事技术上是个有名的“尖子班”。他们给许多部队作过示范表演，走南闯北，名声在外。简直成了宝塔上的尖了！八班有的战士，也自以为有了技术，就有了一切。平时想的是技术，练的是技术。对政治学习不够关心，对思想改造有些忽视。表现比较明显的是老战士李应道。论射击技术，他是国家二级运动员；投弹，一出手就是五十来米；刺杀，班里很难找到对手。他平时练技术特别起劲，但是对政治学习却不关心。他常对班里的同志半开玩笑地说：“你们是‘过软’的，我是‘过硬’的。公差勤务你们多干点，训练表演的时候我去！”八班还有些同志也是技术上各有一套，思想上却问题不少。同志间顶嘴、呕气是常有的事。对其他班也看不起。人们说：“八班技术过硬，思想不过硬。”也有人说：“八班是两头冒尖，技术上冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖。”评四好的时候，都不举八班的手。
    一个尖锐的问题摆在人们面前：我们究竟要培养什么样的战士？光有技术能算是有战斗力吗？在有的人看来，八班是很有战斗力的；但是，从毛主席的建军思想来看，从无产阶级的政治观点来看，从八班的根本情况来看，他们的战斗力不是提高了，而是严重地削弱了。这条路再也不能走下去了！扭偏向首先扭思想
    一九六五年初，林彪同志对部队工作作了极为重要的指示，强调一定要突出政治。林彪同志说，毛主席一向教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是我军的生命线。我们军队的建设历来是把政治建设放在首要地位。一定要突出政治，使政治思想工作真正成为我们全盘工作的基础。刚刚当了班长的王道明听到这个指示，觉得林彪同志就好象站在连队，站在他们面前一样，给他们指出了一条阳关大道。班里同志也说：“我们班只搞技术，不抓思想，走到邪道上去了！”“平时就一个人一个心眼，打仗的时候，还能敲到一个点子上吗？”但是，也有个别同志提出：“只要技术过硬，就不愁不能打胜仗。”“我们钢八班是硬碰硬，主要靠技术吃饭。”
    究竟打仗主要靠政治还是主要靠技术？究竟应该突出政治还是突出技术？两种意见针锋相对，辩论是不能回避的。王道明根据党支部的指示，索性让大家敞开思想，争辩个水落石出。
    讨论会上，不少同志说，我们钢八班、红三连和全军所有的连队、班排一样，过去还不是用梭镖、长矛打败了敌人的洋枪洋炮，用小米加步枪打败了敌人的飞机坦克！有的同志还讲，越南南方人民用竹尖桩、陷阱照样叫美国强盗大吃苦头！所有这些，都说明打仗主要是靠无产阶级的政治，靠人的觉悟。
    他们不但讲到过去，讲到别人，也讲到现在，讲到自己。王道明讲了自己的亲身体会。一九六三年底，他从团部警卫排调到三连八班当战士。当时，他在军事技术上，比八班的老战士差得多。有一段时间，他就只顾猛练、狠练技术，整天地爬来爬去，爬得棉衣露出了棉花，练得臂肿腿痛，总算把技术突上去了。可是，到了节骨眼上还是过不了硬。一九六四年三月，一次实弹战术演习，正当他扔出的手榴弹在远处爆炸的时候，班长命令他趁机冲击。他犹豫了。大家鼓励他向前冲，他还是不敢上，直在原地打转转。这件事情发生后，他一连几个夜晚没有睡好觉。他重新学习了董存瑞、黄继光等英雄事迹，认为自己和这些英雄的差距不是军事技术，主要是政治思想不如他们过硬，缺少革命战士的勇敢、不怕牺牲的精神。王道明就用这件事说明了林彪同志讲的一个根本道理：政治思想过不了硬，打仗时往后跑，再好的军事技术也没有用！
    辩论越来越热烈。有人提出：“不突出政治，我也照样打十环。”很多同志反驳说，有的人光为个人名利争成绩，学技术，他也可以打十环，但是多打一个十环，也就多背了一个思想包袱；十环越多，包袱越重。
    灯不拨不亮，理不辩不明。八班就这样，你一言，我一语，经过很长时间的辩论，越来越认识到突出政治的重要性。最后，王道明总结说：“要保持和发扬钢八班的荣誉，要在战场上真正过硬，就一定要走突出政治的路，钢八班一定要‘钢’在毛泽东思想上！”
    怎样突出政治？怎样扭转班里重技术轻政治的偏向？王道明觉得首先作好副班长李应道的工作是个关键。从此，他经常帮助李应道学习毛主席著作，经常找李应道谈心。有一天，王道明特意把徐寅生《关于如何打乒乓球》的文章带到射击预习场上，一休息，就和李应道一起学起来。当李应道读得起劲的时候，王道明就说：“你看人家，每打一板球，都想的是为祖国争光，想的是为人民服务。咱们每瞄一枪，每投一弹，是不是也这样想过？”王道明这一问，李应道脑海里开始翻腾起来：我过去练技术想的是什么呢？是为保卫祖国去练呢，还是为个人荣誉去练呢？
    经过一番思想斗争，李应道对王道明说：我过去练技术，个人的问题是想得多了一些，为人民服务想得少一些。可是打仗的时候总得要靠技术，思想好，技术不过硬，还是不能消灭敌人。王道明感到这正是李应道模糊认识的一个焦点。这个问题不解决，他的重技术轻政治的观点就很难扭过来。王道明就和他一起重温毛主席关于政治是统帅、是灵魂的教导，并列举了很多英雄模范的事迹和电影故事，一次又一次地和李应道交谈。
    是不是思想好，没有过硬技术，就不能消灭敌人呢？王道明对李应道说：“我看不是这样。董存瑞和黄继光能有那样的英雄行为，并不是因为他们有高超的技术，而主要是他们有过硬的思想。我想，董存瑞并没有练过手托炸药的动作，黄继光也没有练过用身体堵枪眼的动作，可是到了紧要关头，他们却能做出伟大的行动，以自己的生命，换取战斗的胜利。”
    是不是光有过硬的技术，就能打胜仗了呢？王道明就摆出了电影《钢铁战士》中的一个例子。他问李应道：“你看电影里的齐德贵刺杀技术怎么样？”
      “我看他防刺的技术不错！”李应道回答说。
    王道明说：“别看他刺杀有一套。就因为他贪生怕死，后来变成了可耻的叛徒！”
    王道明讲的这些事例，有力地说明了：军事技术是战斗力的重要因素之一，但不是根本的因素，根本的因素，是政治的力量。李应道听了很受启发，用感激的眼光看着王道明说：“这回你打中我的要害了，我算服了！”
    李应道的转变和进步，对钢八班突出政治起了很大推动作用。去年九月，王道明因公外出，李应道针对班里的活思想，积极组织大家活学活用毛主席著作，用政治统帅军事，用思想带动技术，三次实弹射击都打得很好。战士们高兴地说：“副班长变了，又能抓技术，更会抓思想！”营首长在总结这次训练时，也表扬李应道是“突出政治的副班长”。
    李应道尝到了突出政治的甜头，也吃过不突出政治的苦头。他深有感触地说：“我现在才真正懂得了，为个人练技术，练出的技术，只能为个人服务；有了为人民服务的思想，练出的技术，才能真正为人民服务！”他经常用这些切身体会，教育班里的战士。他和王道明同心协力，把八班重技术轻政治的偏向扭了过来。让毛泽东思想成为战士心里的红太阳
    扭转了重技术轻政治的偏向，只是为突出政治扫清了道路。要把政治大大突出起来，就要让毛泽东思想真正成为每个战士心中的红太阳。就要把全班活学活用毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的，无产阶级的觉悟提得高高的，对阶级敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，士气鼓得足足的，团结搞得好好的。这是根本中的根本，一切胜利的根本。
    有一个时期，八班最突出的问题是，班内外的团结不够好，在一周内，就和别班的同志争吵过六次。王道明就带着这个问题，和战士们一起学习了毛主席有关增强团结、批评与自我批评等方面的论述，并着重学习了毛主席在陕甘宁边区劳动英雄和模范工作者会议上讲的一段话。毛主席说：“你们有许多的长处，有很大的功劳，但是你们切记不可以骄傲。”“如果你们骄傲起来，不虚心，不再努力，不尊重人家，不尊重干部，不尊重群众，你们就会当不成英雄和模范了。”这样一学，引起了很大震动。大家说：以前和人家吵架，总以为我们是炸药脾气。现在看来，是我们骄傲了。王道明马上接过来说：“好！我们既然知道错了，明天就去给人家道歉。”有的战士一听说道歉，又不干了。说：“又不是我们全错，道歉不是吃了亏吗？”王道明说：“去道歉并不是我们全错，是承认我们错的一部分。错了多少就承认多少。”在王道明的鼓励下，有六个战士分头去道歉。他们的话还没说完，人家赶紧把责任承担了过去。战士们回来，异口同声地说：“公开承认缺点不是坏事，是天大的好事。按照毛主席指示去做，没错！”从此，钢八班就抓住批评与自我批评这一条不放，反复学，反复用，从多方面树立敢于批评、又乐于接受批评的战斗作风。
    钢八班学得最多、用得最多的是毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导。他们还通过读报、谈家史、参观敌情展览、请来队家属报告等方式，加深对当前国内外阶级斗争形势的认识，从根本上提高无产阶级觉悟。有一次，连长隗福临参观了辽源矿区的“万人坑”以后，向全连介绍了解放前辽源煤矿工人的血泪史。在日伪统治时期，矿工们过着地狱般的生活。五年间，就有一万六千多工人被折磨而死，埋葬在一片乱葬岗上，人们悲痛地称这乱葬岗为“万人坑”。隗连长参观时，亲眼看到有的尸骨上还穿着铁丝，有的尸骨烧得焦黑。八班同志听了连长的报告，难过得吃不下饭。他们把自己苦难的家史和辽源煤矿工人的悲惨历史联系起来，异口同声地说：帝国主义和反动派欠下中国人民的血债真是太多了！全班就借着这件事，讨论了这样一个问题：劳动人民的苦根子是不是已经挖掉了？当前还有没有阶级和阶级斗争？有的说：阶级根子早就挖掉了，就是苦根没有挖掉，剩下的也是个烂根子。王道明和大多数同志不同意这种看法。他们学习了毛主席关于在整个社会主义历史时期以及在国际范围内，阶级和阶级斗争依然存在的语录，大家激动地说：“不要光看到咱们自己翻了身，世界上还有广大的劳动人民，过着象辽源矿工过去那样的悲惨生活。现在，全世界劳动人民的总祸根——帝国主义，并没有挖掉。要说阶级根子挖掉了，咱们的黄军装就可以不要穿了！”
    这次学习，使全班战士由煤矿工人的苦，自己家庭的苦，联想到全世界还没有解放的劳动人民的苦。大家进一步认识到：中国人民的命运和世界人民的命运是不可分的。为整个阶级解放和人类解放的壮丽事业，贡献个人的一切，以至生命，是最光荣不过的。
    他们还遵照毛主席关于完全、彻底为人民服务的教导，在日常工作和生活中，狠抓兴无灭资，自觉地和一切个人私心杂念作斗争。王道明从学习毛主席著作中深深感到：毛主席的每一句话，都是教导我们要全心全意为人民服务，要和个人主义的私心杂念作斗争。想想自己带的一个班，有没有私心杂念呢？有的同志在个人利益和集体利益发生矛盾的时候往往想不通；有的同志有了成绩归个人，受了挫折怨别人；甚至有的同志少吃一点东西都感到“吃了亏”。他想：一个人平时对个人生活小事都这样计较，战时怎么能够用自己的生命去为整体换取胜利呢！他们就是这样，从小事看根子，从现象看本质，从现在看将来，在日常生活中一点一滴地挖私心，培养集体主义思想。有一次，新战士王卓堂建议全班到团部礼堂擦灯泡。王道明感到很奇怪。王卓堂个头比较高，宿舍里的灯泡几乎碰到头，脏了他也不想擦一下，为什么忽然主动提出到团部去擦灯泡？是不是想要团首长表扬八班呢？他越想越觉得这里面有文章。如果不先把脑袋擦亮，灯泡也擦不亮。他找王卓堂一谈，果然不错。在班务会上，王卓堂用自己的亲身体会说明，如果带着私心做好事，不仅不能克服私心，私心反会越来越重。这事虽小，对全班教育却很深。大家深深感到：私心会不知不觉地养成，却不会不知不觉地去掉。王道明对战士要求严，对自己要求更严。遇事先集体，后个人，吃苦在前，享受在后。开饭的时候，如果同时有粗粮和细粮，他总是争着吃粗粮，把细粮留给别的同志吃。他的津贴费，大部分都用于公家或别人的身上。有时他也想给家里寄点钱，可是，当别的同志的家庭遇到困难的时候，他就毫不吝惜地把自己储蓄的钱给战友的家庭寄去。王道明就这样带动全班同志，自觉地反反复复和私心杂念作斗争，使全班个人主义杂念越来越少，集体主义思想越来越多，团结越来越好。
    私心杂念少了，人的品质就高了，为革命事业献身的决心就大了。在一次执行扑灭山火的紧急任务中，钢八班的同志们充分表现了为人民利益舍死忘生的高贵品质。一天傍晚，红三连刚到宿营地，忽然接到上级命令：立即赶往某地扑灭山火。全连干部战士不顾疲劳，迅速赶到起火地点。当时，天黑风大，山火越烧越烈。一团团浓烟烈火四处蔓延，一丈多高的火头，被旋风卷得横冲直闯。在这紧要关头，八班同志在连首长的指挥和带领下，奋勇投入灭火战斗。为了使人民财产少受损失，八班同志不怕烟熏火燎，把个人安危置之度外，火头到那里，他们就冲到那里；树条扫把打坏了，他们就纵身跳进火堆，用脚狠跺猛踩。在九个小时的灭火战斗中，王道明和他带领的八班始终冲在前，干在先。灭火回来的路上，草原人烟稀少，住房、吃饭都比较困难。八班以最大的阶级友爱对待兄弟班的同志。房子拥挤，他们把火炕让给兄弟班睡，全班同志主动到外面去放哨；三班带的干粮吃完了，八班把节省下来的一挎包馒头全部送给三班。他们真正做到了冲锋在前，退却在后，吃苦在前，享受在后，出色地经受了火海的考验，荣立集体二等功。八班真正成了政治上、思想上、作风上过得硬的钢八班了！
    靠毛泽东思想过硬，靠毛泽东思想聪明。一年来，王道明和他带领的钢八班，在党支部的领导下，经过不断斗争，沿着突出政治的宽阔道路大步前进。过去那种重技术轻政治的观点，那些个人的私心杂念，象灰尘一样，不断地被扫除。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的钢八班，就象一座小小的“炼钢炉”，正在把每一个战士冶炼成钢。一九六五年底，这个班又有四个优秀的战士，光荣地参加了中国共产党。所有这些，充分显示了突出政治的巨大威力。钢八班的同志说，连队的同志说，所有知道八班进步情况的同志也说，这条突出政治的路，完全走对了！
