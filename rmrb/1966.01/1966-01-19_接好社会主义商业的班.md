	Taking Over the Socialist Commercial Class
	Lei Shufang, Salesperson of Zhangxizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shunyi County
	I had a similar experience to the young worker Xiao Zhang in the film. After graduating from junior high school, I was assigned to work in a rural supply and marketing store. At that time, some of my classmates who graduated with me went on to senior high school, some went into factories, some became soldiers, and some, although also assigned to the commercial front, were in the city. Comparing myself to them, I always felt that my work was not promising and thought about switching professions.
	Xiao Zhang quickly changed. He went from looking down on commerce to being willing to work in the mountains for the rest of his life, carrying a basket for the rest of his life, and became the successor of socialist commerce. How did he change? He studied Chairman Mao's works with Wang Fushan, establishing the idea of serving the people; he delivered goods with Wang Fushan, increasing his class feelings through contact with the broad masses of peasants. Through practice, he realized the significant role of rural commerce. I am also changing. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that doing commerce is doing revolution, and it is equally glorious. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and peasants are the main force of our country's revolution. The supply and marketing cooperative directly serves agricultural production and the lives of peasants. Isn't that glorious! In the future, I will definitely follow Xiao Zhang's example, taking Wang Fushan as a role model, diligently studying Chairman Mao's works, and taking over the socialist commercial class.
	In addition, the film also has some shortcomings, such as the insufficient portrayal of the advanced figure Wang Fushan's wife and her active participation in labor; the clothing is also somewhat urbanized, which does not seem to match Wang Fushan very well. These are my personal opinions, and they may not be appropriate.

    接好社会主义商业的班
    顺义县张喜庄供销社售货员　雷淑芳
    我和影片中的青年职工小张有着类似的经历。我初中毕业以后，分配到农村供销店工作，当时和我一道毕业的同学，有的升入高中，有的进了工厂，有的当了解放军，有的虽然也分配在商业战线上，可是人家是在城市里。比来比去，总觉得自己的工作没出息，想着跳行。
    小张很快转变了。他由轻商变成愿意在山区干一辈子，背一辈子篓，变成了社会主义商业的接班人。他是怎样转变过来的呢？他跟王福山一道学习毛主席著作，树立了为人民服务的思想；他跟王福山一道送货，通过与广大农民接触，增加了阶级感情。通过实践，认识到了农村商业的重大作用。我也在转变着。我学习了毛主席著作以后，懂得了干商业就是干革命，同样是很光荣的。农业是国民经济的基础，农民是我国革命的主力军，供销社是直接为农业生产、为农民生活服务的，难道还不光荣！今后我一定和小张一样以王福山为榜样，认真地学习毛主席著作，接好社会主义商业的班。
    另外，影片也有些不足之处，例如对先进人物王福山的妻子，积极参加劳动的一面反映得不够；服装也有些城市化，好象与王福山不十分对衬。这是我个人的看法，不一定恰当。
