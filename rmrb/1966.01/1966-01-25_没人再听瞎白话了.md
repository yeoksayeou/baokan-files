Title: Nobody Listens to Nonsense Anymore

    One winter evening, in the watchman's house of a neighboring production team, I saw a group of commune members quietly listening to a storyteller called "Blind Wan," who was gesturing and telling old stories. Just as he reached the part where a "hero" was chasing after a young lady with "the beauty to make fish sink and geese fall, the face to shame the moon and hide the flowers," the sanxian stopped, and Blind Wan announced, "To be continued in the next episode." Many commune members clamored for the next part. Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but think: How much the commune members need cultural life! But what was Blind Wan spreading?
    Just as the threshing and grain delivery were about to end, the higher-level Party committee issued instructions to vigorously develop rural amateur cultural activities and enliven rural cultural life.
    The Party branch, the Communist Youth League, and the cultural center asked me to learn to tell revolutionary stories, and I happily agreed. But I thought: Can I tell them well? Will the commune members listen? I expressed my concerns, and the Party organization told me, "Xiaoshen, don't treat compiling and telling revolutionary stories as a trivial matter. This is a struggle between proletarian cultural thought and the feudalist and capitalist cultural thought of Blind Wan! Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it. If you encounter difficulties, you can consult Chairman Mao's works." The organization's help gave me strength, and Chairman Mao's works helped me find the direction forward.
    I began to compile and tell the story of "Yang Zirong Outwits the Bandit Boss." In order to learn how to portray Yang Zirong's wit and bravery and Bandit Boss's viciousness and treachery, I not only read the novel *Tracks in the Snowy Forest* and related comic books, but also borrowed a large mirror. During my spare time, I concentrated on practicing facial expressions and movements of various characters in the mirror. To practice ventriloquism, I asked my neighbor for a puppy. Whenever I had time, I would tease the dog to bark, trying to figure out how a dog sounds barking at night, both far and near. To get up early and go to the woods at the village entrance to learn the sounds of trains, guns, and whistles, I moved my luggage to the production team's watchman's house. People said I was obsessed. After repeated practice and revision, I gained some confidence and started telling the story to the commune members.
    One rainy day, the commune members couldn't go out to work and were all gathered in the watchman's house. A group of young people were playing cards on the kang, and a group of old people were chatting idly on the edge of the kang. Some were watching the card game. Seeing this situation, I thought, this is a good opportunity, so I mustered up my courage and began to tell my adapted story: "The sun had just risen from the top of the eastern mountain, a small forest train, emitting black smoke, puffing white air, and sounding a long whistle, passed through one mountain after another, crossed one ridge after another..." As soon as I started, the card players forgot to play their cards, and the chatting old people forgot to smoke. Dozens of eyes stared straight at me. I paused for breath, looked around, and the commune members Yang Xiwen and Li Yaochun said anxiously, "Tell us quickly, it's really interesting to listen to, it's more enjoyable than playing anything!" People said, putting away their cards, and listened attentively to me. As soon as the story ended, everyone applauded and praised, "The compilation is not bad, and the telling is also good, it's a hundred times better than what Blind Wan tells, it's really like a 'live movie'." This successful attempt further increased my confidence in telling revolutionary stories. From then on, whether it was by the fields or on the kang, I would tell stories whenever I had time, wherever I went. I wanted to spread revolutionary stories throughout the team and sow Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of the commune members.
    Later, Blind Wan revisited the old place and arrived at Toujingzi Village. As soon as his weak flute and shrill gong started, some young commune members ran up to Blind Wan and sarcastically said, "Forget it! We have 'live movies' here, nobody listens to your nonsense anymore, don't come this way again." Blind Wan felt something was wrong and left dejectedly. (Attached picture)

    没人再听瞎白话了
    黑龙江省肇州县永胜公社兴旺大队社员  李晓深
    冬天的一个傍晚，我在邻队的更房子里，看到一伙社员在静听一个叫万瞎子的说书人比比划划地说旧书，正当讲到一位“英雄”追赶一位有“沉鱼落雁之容，闭月羞花之貌”的小姐的时候，三弦一停，万瞎子宣布且听下回分解。许多社员纷纷要求讲下段。看到这样的场面，我情不自禁地想：社员们多么需要文化生活啊！可万瞎子却散布些啥东西？
    打场送粮刚要结束，上级党委就提出了大力开展农村业余文化活动，活跃农村文化生活的指示。
    党团组织和文化室让我学讲革命故事，我很高兴地答应了。但我想：我能讲好吗？社员会听吗？我把顾虑说了出来，党组织就跟我说：“晓深，你可别把编讲革命故事当成小事，这是无产阶级文化思想和万瞎子的封建主义、资本主义文化思想作斗争啊！天下无难事，就怕有心人。有困难可以向毛主席著作请教嘛。”组织的帮助给了我力量，毛主席著作使我找到前进的方向。
    我开始编讲《杨子荣舌战小炉匠》的故事，为了学会刻划杨子荣的机智英勇和座山雕的凶恶阴险，我不仅看了长篇小说《林海雪原》和有关的小人书，还借了一块大镜子，利用劳动之余，专心致志地对着镜子练习刻划各种人物在讲话时的表情和动作。为了练习口技，我向邻居要了个小狗，一有空就逗狗咬，琢磨狗在夜间远处和近处叫的声音。为了起大早到屯头树林里学火车、枪炮和汽笛声，我把行李搬到生产队更房子住。人家都说我着迷了。经过反复练，反复改，有了些把握，就把故事讲给社员听。
    那是一个阴雨天，社员不能外出干活，都聚在更房子里，炕头有一伙青年打扑克，炕梢有一伙老年人在闲唠喀，有的围着打扑克的看热闹。我看到这种情形，心想，这正是个好机会，就鼓起了勇气，把改编的故事讲了起来：“太阳刚从东山顶露了出来，一辆森林小火车，冒着黑烟，吐着白气，鸣着长长的汽笛，穿过了一山又一山，越过了一岭又一岭……”这一讲不要紧，打扑克的人忘了出牌，闲谈的老人忘了吸烟，几十只眼睛直勾勾地盯着我。这时我稍停喘息，举目四望，社员杨喜文、李耀春着急地说：“你快讲吧，听的真有意思，比玩啥都过瘾！”人们说着就把扑克收拾起来了，全神贯注地听我讲。故事刚一结束，大家鼓掌叫好：“编的可不错，讲的也好，比万瞎子讲的强百倍，真赶上‘活电影’了。”这一次尝试成功，更增强我讲革命故事的信心，以后，我不论田边、炕头，有空就讲，走到那里，讲到那里。我要把革命故事传遍全队，把毛泽东思想播进社员心里。
    后来，万瞎子又旧地重游，到了头井子屯，他那有气无力的笛子声和尖声尖气的镗锣声刚开场，有的青年社员跑到万瞎子跟前讥讽地说：“算了吧！我们这里有‘活电影’了，没人再听你瞎白话了，你再别走这条道了。”万瞎子觉得不对劲，便灰溜溜地走了。（附图片）
