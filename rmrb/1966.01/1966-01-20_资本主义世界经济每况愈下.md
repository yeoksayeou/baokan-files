    The Capitalist World Economy is Steadily Declining
      Associated Press Says: Western European Economy Has Definitely Stagnated
    The economic prosperity of Europe in recent years has definitely stagnated. Some countries even declined in 1965. Many experts predict that the pace will continue to slow down in 1966.
    For the first time in fourteen years, West Germany has experienced a deficit in its balance of international payments – imports exceeding exports, and economic growth will be even slower in 1966. The economic picture in Western European countries is almost the same everywhere. Many people in France have expressed doubts as to whether the upward trend can continue. Britain is desperately trying to solve Western Europe’s biggest economic problem, which has caused it to encounter long-term balance of payments problems. Italy's economic recovery in 1965 did not meet people's expectations.

  Japanese Official Report Says: Western Economies Will Have Difficulty Developing
      The (Japanese) Economic Planning Agency has formulated the 1965 World Economic Report (White Paper on the World Economy), striving to focus on analyzing the world economy and its prospects.
    In 1966, the British economy will stagnate, and the economies of the United States and West Germany will have difficulty developing.
    In terms of the balance of international payments, many major countries have experienced serious imbalances, which has brought some unease to the prospects of world trade. At the same time, it has led many countries to reconsider the shortcomings of the current monetary system itself, and more actively conduct debates on reforming the monetary system.
