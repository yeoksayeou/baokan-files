    A Batch of Excellent Revolutionary Modern Dramas from the Southwest Region Performed in Beijing
    This batch of modern dramas includes 22 large and small plays, belonging to six different types of drama: spoken drama, Sichuan opera, Guizhou flower lantern opera, Yunnan flower lantern opera, Bai opera, and Dian opera.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Following the successive performances of excellent revolutionary modern dramas from the Northwest and Central South regions in Beijing, a batch of excellent revolutionary modern dramas from the Southwest region has recently begun to meet with audiences in the capital.
    The revolutionary modern dramas from the Southwest region performing in Beijing this time are all excellent works that emerged from the Southwest Regional Spoken Drama and Local Opera Performance and Observation Conference held last September. There are a total of 22 large and small plays, belonging to six different types of drama: spoken drama, Sichuan opera, Guizhou flower lantern opera, Yunnan flower lantern opera, Bai opera, and Dian opera. They are scheduled to come to Beijing in three batches. The first batch, including the Sichuan Opera "Raging Rapids Loyal Heart" by the Sichuan Modern Sichuan Opera Experimental Troupe, "Ordinary Post" by the Guizhou Provincial Flower Lantern Opera Troupe, and the Dian Opera "Cook," the Sichuan Opera (Tanxi) "Manages Too Much," and the Sichuan dialect one-act spoken drama "Good Helper," etc., have been performed successively in the capital since the 13th.
    The script of "Raging Rapids Loyal Heart" is based on a moving story that took place in August 1963 in the Jianglun Wooden Boat Production Cooperative in Peng'an County, in the middle reaches of the Jialing River. When the old helmsman Zheng Peiliang was piloting a wooden boat through dangerous shoals, his son unfortunately fell into the water. In order to ensure the safety of the class brothers on the boat and to ensure that state materials were not lost, he resolutely abandoned his son to save the boat, steadied the helm, and broke through the dangerous shoals. Later, with the help of the local Party organization and the masses, his son was also rescued. When the author, director, and actors were creating this play, they went to this transportation cooperative to work and were deeply infected by the revolutionary spirit of the boatmen, thus successfully shaping the heroic character of the old helmsman He Zhongmin. When this play was performed and observed in the Southwest region, people believed that it maintained the characteristics of the traditional artistic performance program of Sichuan opera, and also had innovations and creations according to the needs of real life, and was well received by the audience.
    "Ordinary Post," which brought sanitation workers to the stage for the first time, enthusiastically praised the new life, new ideas, and new style of sanitation workers, and enthusiastically praised their ordinary and great labor through the conflict between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. This play was originally created by the Guiyang City Pingju Troupe during an in-depth life experience in an environmental sanitation management station in the city. At the beginning, some people in the troupe themselves had bourgeois ideas that despised sanitation work. When they went down to the grassroots, they just sat in the office and talked to people to collect materials. Although they spent more than four months, they did not write a decent script. Later, they summed up the lessons of failure, and in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into the sanitation workers, worked and lived with the workers. In the common labor, their thoughts and feelings gradually changed, and they finally more successfully brought the sanitation workers to the stage. The "Ordinary Post," which was transplanted and performed by the Guizhou Provincial Flower Lantern Opera Troupe, was an improvement over the original and was considered a good play with educational significance.
    "Cook" and "Manages Too Much" and "Good Helper," which reflect new people and new things in rural areas, also have their own characteristics. Among them, the Dian opera "Cook," adapted from the novel "Who Is She," shows the audience a corner of the Vietnamese people's great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    西南区一批优秀革命现代戏在京公演
    这批现代戏共有大、小戏二十二个，分别属于话剧、川剧、贵州花灯剧、云南花灯剧、白剧、滇剧等六个剧种。
    新华社十八日讯　继西北区、中南区的优秀革命现代戏陆续来京演出之后，西南区一批优秀的革命现代戏最近也开始在首都和观众见面。
    这次西南区来京演出的革命现代戏，都是去年九月举行的西南区话剧、地方戏观摩演出大会上涌现出来的优秀剧目。一共有大、小戏二十二个，分别属于话剧、川剧、贵州花灯剧、云南花灯剧、白剧、滇剧六个剧种，计划分三批来京。第一批，四川省现代川剧实验剧团的川剧《急浪丹心》、贵州省花灯剧团的《平凡的岗位》和滇剧《厨娘》、川剧（弹戏）《管得宽》、四川方言独幕话剧《好帮手》等三个小戏，已经从十三日起先后在首都公演。
    剧本《急浪丹心》所依据的，是一九六三年八月发生在嘉陵江中游蓬安县江轮木船生产合作社的一个动人的故事。老驾长郑培亮驾驶木船过险滩时，他的儿子不幸落水。为了船上阶级兄弟的生命安全和确保国家物资不受损失，他毅然舍子救船，掌稳船舵，闯过险滩。后来在当地党组织和群众的帮助下，他的儿子也被救生还。作者、导演和演员在创作这出戏时，曾到这个运输合作社跟班劳动，深受船工们的革命精神的感染，因而成功地塑造了老驾长何忠民这个英雄人物。这个戏在西南区观摩演出时，人们认为它既保持了川剧传统艺术表演程式的特色，又根据现实生活的需要有革新创造，受到观众的好评。
    第一次把掏粪工人搬上舞台的《平凡的岗位》，通过无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的矛盾冲突，热情地歌颂了掏粪工人的新生活、新思想、新风格，热情地歌颂了他们平凡而伟大的劳动。这个戏原来是贵阳市评剧团在这个市一个环境卫生管理站深入生活过程中创作的。开始，这个剧团的一些人自己就有鄙视掏粪劳动的资产阶级思想，到了下面也只是坐在办公室里找人谈话，搜集材料，虽然花了四个多月的时间，却没有写出一个象样的剧本。后来他们总结了失败的教训，按照毛主席的教导，深入到清洁工人中去，和工人们一起掏粪，一起生活。在共同的劳动中，他们的思想感情逐渐起了变化，终于比较成功地把掏粪工人搬上了舞台。贵州省花灯剧团移植、演出的《平凡的岗位》，比原作有提高，被认为是富有教育意义的一出好戏。
    《厨娘》和反映农村新人新事的《管得宽》《好帮手》，也各具特色。其中根据小说《她是谁》改编的滇剧《厨娘》，向观众展示了越南人民伟大的抗美救国斗争的一角。
