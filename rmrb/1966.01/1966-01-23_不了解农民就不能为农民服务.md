    For more than four months, I have personally witnessed the lives and labor of the peasants, and I have taken a step closer to the poor and lower-middle peasants in terms of ideological feelings. In the future, I will work even more diligently, strive to practice, and strive to transform myself to achieve ideological and technical proficiency.
    Without Understanding Farmers, One Cannot Serve Farmers
    Truly Down to the Countryside
    I grew up in a big city and have been accustomed to the comfortable life of a big city for many years. Occasionally going to the countryside was just a fleeting glance. Only this time can it be considered truly going down to the countryside. It has been more than four months since the end of August last year.
    When I first arrived, I lived in a mud house, slept on a hard kang (a heated brick bed), used vegetable oil lamps, and ate communal meals, as if I had entered another world. Contact with poor and lower-middle peasants was also very unnatural. I also could not do some things that seemed simple at work. For example, once when I was giving an injection at a patient's home, I had no tools to open the ampoule of distilled water. I used the handle of a large, rough knife to hit it, which shattered the ampoule and wasted the distilled water. After several such incidents, I felt that my past work and living conditions were too far removed from the countryside. How could I talk about serving the peasants? So I made up my mind to learn to do these things and also learn to do some simple acupuncture.
    Overcame a Difficult Hurdle
    After coming to the countryside, my mood has been very tense. My biggest concern was that one day someone might suddenly ask me to rescue a difficult labor. In such simple conditions in the countryside, what should I do? The thing I worried about finally happened. At the end of November last year, the medical team of Mizi Dian Commune asked me to rescue a 42-year-old woman in labor. It was her eighth pregnancy, and she had a breech presentation. After my careful examination, a cesarean section was required. I told the family that the pregnant woman needed to be sent to Tongxian County Hospital for surgery, but they said they had difficulties and asked me to try my best to deliver the baby at home. In this situation, what should I do? Could I just watch the mother and child die? I thought I should find a way to rescue them no matter what. The moment to test me had arrived. I had to stay calm and consider the problem carefully and comprehensively. So, on the one hand, I called the health center to send an intravenous drip bottle, and on the other hand, I encouraged the pregnant woman to push downwards and took the initiative to perform the rescue. After a tense operation, relying on my skilled technique and my heart for serving the peasants, the baby was delivered. The mother's massive bleeding and the baby's suffocation were also successfully treated, finally saving the lives of both mother and child. At this time, although I was exhausted and my cotton jacket sleeves and cotton shoes were soaked in blood, I was particularly happy because I had overcome a difficult hurdle and my skills could serve the poor and lower-middle peasants in the simple rural conditions!
    In these four months, we also performed some major surgeries such as total hysterectomies. Each time, the comrades of the medical team, regardless of their department, would voluntarily act as my assistants whenever surgery was needed, enabling me to complete the surgical tasks with the care and help of my comrades. And after the surgery, everyone would always let me go to sleep and proactively help me take care of the patient. All of this gave me great support and comfort, making me deeply feel that in our great motherland, although we come from all corners of the country and have different jobs, we can all be closely united under the same revolutionary banner, helping each other, encouraging each other, and better serving the people.
    In the process of teaching and training, my mood was also not very calm. The students in the semi-agricultural, semi-medical classes have varying levels of education, some from junior high school and some from elementary school, and many have been working for many years. I had never taught such students before, and I was determined to speak more plainly and be patient with them. Therefore, I explained it again and again in class, asked again and again, and sometimes even explained it after class, but some students still could not understand. I thought, "How can I teach such students?" "Can such people become brigade doctors?" Later, their practical actions educated me, and I realized that my original view was wrong.
    Strive to Transform Myself
    In short, living and working in the countryside for more than four months, I have felt bitterness, encountered difficulties, experienced feelings of annoyance and impatience, and sometimes wanted to retreat. However, the light of the Party has always shone on me, and I often remember that I came down in response to the Party's call, and I want to train myself to better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past four months, we have cured some diseases, and the villagers have said many enthusiastic things to our faces, such as "You have come, saving so many people from suffering!" "In the past, no matter how much money I spent, I couldn't hire such a good doctor." We said, "This is what we should do," "This is what Chairman Mao told us to do." We said very little, but through our actual work, we have strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. I have come to realize that we medical workers are also political workers, and doing medical work is also doing revolution. What we have done is far from enough!
    In the past four months, I have initially understood the life of the countryside, taken a step closer to the poor and lower-middle peasants in terms of ideological feelings, and realized that in the past, many of our medical treatment, teaching, and scientific research were not in line with the actual situation of the vast countryside. I have also received a lot of training in my work. In the past, I was accustomed to the work of the director of a department in a large hospital, with clear division of labor, good conditions, responsibility at each level, reliance on others, and being high above, pointing fingers. Now, I need to do the work of resident physicians and nurses myself, and I have further realized that their labor is very valuable.
    In the future, I will be more conscientious, learn with humility, strive to practice, and strive to transform myself to achieve ideological and technical proficiency, and better complete the tasks assigned to the medical team by the Party.

### 不了解农民就不能为农民服务

专栏：

    四个多月来，我亲眼看到了农民生活和劳动的情况，在思想感情上与贫下中农接近了一步。今后，我要更加兢兢业业，努力实践，努力改造自己，做到思想过硬，技术过硬。
    不了解农民就不能为农民服务
    真正下到了农村
    我从小生长在大城市，多年来习惯了大城市舒适的生活。偶尔去一下农村，也只是走马观花。只有这一次才算真正下到了农村。从去年八月底到现在已有四个多月了。
    刚下来的时候，我住在土房子里，睡硬炕，点菜油灯，吃派饭，就好象进入了另外一个世界。和贫下中农的接触也很不自然。工作上有些看来很简单的事我也做不好，比如有一次我在病家打针，在打开注射用水安瓿时没有工具，就用了一把大粗刀柄一打，结果将一个安瓿打得粉碎，注射用水也糟踏掉了。经过这样几件事情以后，我感到我过去的工作和生活条件离农村太远了，怎么谈得上为农民服务呢？于是我下决心学会做这些事，并且学会做一些简易的针灸。
    闯过了一个难关
    到农村来后，我的心情一直很紧张，最担心的是说不定那一天有人突然找我去抢救难产，在农村这样简陋的条件下，我该怎么办？担心的事终于发生了。去年十一月底觅子店公社医疗队找我去抢救一个四十二岁的产妇。她是第八胎，臀位难产，经过我仔细检查，需要作剖腹产手术。我告诉家属需要把产妇送到通县医院去作手术，他表示有困难，要求尽量争取在家中接生。在这种情况下，怎么办？难道能够眼看着产妇母子双双死去吗？我想无论如何应当想办法抢救。考验我的时刻已经到来，我要稳得住，全面仔细考虑问题。于是我一方面打电话让卫生院来人送静脉点滴瓶，一方面鼓励产妇向下用力，自己动手进行抢救。经过一场紧张的动作，依靠我熟练的技术和为农民服务的心，使婴儿分娩出来；产妇大出血和婴儿窒息，也都顺利地进行了处理，终于保全了母子两人的生命。这时，虽然我疲劳不堪，我的棉袄袖子和棉鞋都被鲜血湿透了，但是心里特别高兴，因为我闯过了一个难关，我的技术能够在简陋的农村条件下为贫下中农服务了！
    在这四个多月里，我们还作了一些子宫全截除之类的大手术。每次，医疗队的同志，不管是那一科的，只要手术需要，都主动当我的助手，使我能够在同志的关怀和帮助下完成手术任务。而且手术以后，大家一定让我去睡觉，主动帮助我照顾病人。这些都给了我极大的支持和安慰，使我深深地感到在我们伟大的祖国，我们虽然来自五湖四海，各有不同的工作岗位，但在同一个革命旗帜下都能够紧紧地团结起来，互相帮助，互相鼓舞，更好地为人民服务。
    在教学和培训的过程中，我的心情也不是很平静的。半农半医班的学生，有初中的、小学的，程度不一，而且很多人已参加劳动多年。这样的学生我从未教过，下定了决心要讲得通俗些，一定要对他们耐心，因此在上课时讲了一遍又一遍，问了一遍又一遍，有时下了课还讲，但是有个别的同学仍然不能领会。我想：“怎么让我教这样的学生？”“这样的人能当大队医生么？”以后他们的实际行动教育了我，我才感到自己原来的看法错了。
    努力改造自己
    总之，四个多月生活和工作在农村，我感到过苦，遇到过困难，有过烦闷急躁情绪，有时也想退缩。但是，党的光辉始终照耀着我，我时常记着我是响应党的号召下来的，我要锻炼自己更好地为贫下中农服务。四个多月来，我们治好了一些病，老乡当着我们的面说了多少热情的话，如“你们来了，少祸害多少人呢！”“以前我再花多少钱也请不到这样好的大夫。”我们说，“这是我们应当做的”，“这是毛主席叫我们做的”。我们说的话很少，但通过我们的实际工作，密切了党和群众的关系。我体会到我们医务工作者也是政治工作者，干医务工作也是干革命。我们做的太不够了！
    四个多月来，我初步了解了农村的生活，在思想感情上与贫下中农接近了一步，认识到过去我们在医疗、教学、科学研究上有很多是不符合广大农村实际的。在工作上也得到了不少锻炼，过去习惯于大医院科主任的工作，分工明确，条件好，层层负责，有所依靠，高高在上，指指点点。现在是住院医师、护理工作都需亲自动手，进一步体会到他们的劳动是很可贵的。
    今后，我要更加兢兢业业，虚心学习，努力实践，努力改造自己，做到思想过得硬，技术过得硬，更好地完成党交给医疗队的任务。
