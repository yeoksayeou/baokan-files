    National Girls' Youth Table Tennis Tournament Held in Beijing
    (Xinhua News Agency, January 28th) The 1966 National Girls' Youth Table Tennis Championships, involving 21 units, commenced today in Beijing. This is the third such championship held since 1964.
    In the first stage of the group cycle matches for the team events—middle school grassroots teams, elementary school grassroots teams, mixed teams, and representative teams—which began today, almost all of the more than 200 players, aged eleven to seventeen, participating in the championships took to the court.
    In the mixed team event, a new situation emerged: Liaoning team, ranked tenth in the previous competition, defeated the "seeded" team in its group, Beijing First Team, which ranked third in the previous competition, with a score of three to one. When these two teams faced off last year, Beijing First Team had won three to zero. Shanghai team, the champion of the mixed team event last year, and Shanghai Julu Road No. 1 Elementary School team, the champion of the elementary school grassroots team event last year, both defeated their opponents with a score of three to zero in their first matches. Fuzhou No. 5 Middle School team, the champion of the middle school grassroots team event last year, did not play today.
    When the young athletes from the Tibet Autonomous Region team, participating in the representative team event for the first time, appeared on the court, the entire audience erupted in warm applause. Although they lost to the Zhejiang team today with a score of one to three, their brave and tenacious fighting style won the praise of the audience.
    This competition has the largest number of participants in any previous event, with a total of 267 participants. All four events are divided into two stages: preliminary rounds and finals. The entire competition will conclude on February 5th.
    Yesterday afternoon, Beijing's youth representatives held a welcoming party to welcome the young female athletes from all over the country. Rong Gaotang, Vice Minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission; Hu Keshi, Yang Haibo, and Hui Shuchang, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; Liu Aifeng and Lin Liru, Vice Ministers of Education; and responsible persons from relevant units in Beijing attended the welcoming party and met with the young female athletes from various regions. Hu Keshi, Liu Aifeng, and Rong Gaotang also spoke one after another, encouraging the young female athletes to earnestly study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, have the motherland at heart, have the world in mind, play table tennis for the revolution, and exercise for the revolution.

    全国女少年乒乓球赛在京举行
    据新华社二十八日讯  一九六六年全国二十一单位女少年乒乓球锦标赛今天在北京揭开战幕。这是继一九六四年以来第三次举行这种锦标赛。
    在今天开始进行的中学基层队、小学基层队、混合队和代表队四个项目团体赛的第一阶段分组循环赛中，参加锦标赛的二百多名十一岁到十七岁的选手，几乎全部挥拍上阵。
    在混合队团体赛中，出现了新的情况：上届第十名辽宁队以三比一战胜了小组的“种子”队、上届第三名的北京一队。这两个队在去年交锋时，北京一队曾以三比零取胜。去年混合队团体赛冠军上海队、去年小学基层队团体赛冠军上海巨鹿路第一小学队，在第一场比赛中都以三比零战胜了自己的对手。去年中学基层队团体赛冠军福州第五中学队，今天没有出场比赛。
    当第一次参加代表队团体赛的西藏自治区队的少年选手们出现在比赛场时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。她们今天虽然以一比三败给了浙江队，但是她们那种勇敢顽强的战斗风格，赢得了观众的好评。
    这次比赛是历届参加人数最多的一次，共有二百六十七人参加。四个比赛项目都分预赛和决赛两个阶段进行。全部比赛将在二月五日结束。
    昨天下午，北京市的少年代表曾经举行欢迎会，欢迎各地的少年女选手。国家体委副主任荣高棠，共青团中央书记处书记胡克实、杨海波、惠庶昌，教育部副部长刘皑风、林砺儒，以及北京市有关单位的负责人出席了欢迎会，同各地的女少年运动员见了面。胡克实、刘皑风、荣高棠还先后讲话，勉励女少年运动员们认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为革命而打球，为革命而锻炼。
