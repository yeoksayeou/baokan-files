    Xinhua News Agency, 24th. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory: Yesterday afternoon, snowfall began in eastern Gansu and Shaanxi. Later, the snow area expanded to southern Inner Mongolia, Henan, northern Hubei, Shanxi, western Hebei, and northern Anhui. By 8:00 AM today, generally less than three millimeters of light snow had fallen in areas north of the Huai River and the Qinling Mountains. However, central and southern Henan and northwestern Shanxi experienced moderate snow of three to six millimeters, with heavy snow in some local areas. Currently, snowfall in the Northwest region has stopped, and the snow area is moving towards the North China Plain, Shandong, the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River basin, and southern Northeast China. It is estimated that the amount of snow will generally not be large.
    This snowfall is slightly beneficial to overwintering wheat in the northern arid regions, but due to the small amount of snow, the drought situation in the drought-stricken areas has not been alleviated and it is still necessary to strengthen drought resistance efforts.

    北方旱区普降小雪
    新华社二十四日讯　据中央气象台消息：昨日下午，甘肃东部和陕西开始下雪。以后雪区扩大到内蒙古南部、河南、湖北北部、山西、河北西部以及安徽北部。到今天八时，在淮河、秦岭以北地区，一般下了不足三毫米的小雪。但河南中南部、山西西北部达到三到六毫米的中雪，局部地区有大雪。目前，西北地区降雪已停，雪区正在向华北平原、山东、淮河流域中下游以及东北南部地区移动，估计雪量一般不大。
    这次降雪对北方旱区越冬小麦稍有好处，但由于雪量较小，受旱地区的旱情并未缓和，还需加强抗旱。
