    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 11th (Dispatch): According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front recently decided to posthumously award the First Class Bronze Wall Medal to martyr Chen Wendang and martyr Da Deshan Wang, and the Second Class Bronze Wall Medal to martyr Li Wenbei, to commend their significant contributions to the struggle against America and for national salvation.
    Martyr Chen Wendang was a young electrician from Da Nang City. In October 1964, he joined the Saigon-Gia Dinh area Liberation Army, where he played a model role in combat. He was active in his work and studies, unafraid of difficulties and hardships, and consistently completed the tasks assigned by his superiors well.
    On March 22nd of last year, he was unfortunately captured while on a mission. The enemy subjected him to all kinds of torture and tried to threaten and lure him in various ways, but his determination to fight and sacrifice for the people and the motherland remained unshaken. He never revealed any secrets to the enemy, demonstrating the noble qualities of a revolutionary fighter.
    Finally, the enemy sentenced him to death. On the morning of June 22nd last year, when the enemy was about to escort him to the execution ground, he was calm and composed, without any fear. He carefully wrapped his belongings and gave them to a fellow prisoner, then changed into a new set of clothes, tidied his hair, and calmly walked onto the prison car. At the execution ground, he was brave and unyielding, sternly denouncing the enemy: "If I die alone, fourteen million compatriots in the South will rise up to oppose you." "Why do you hold guns and not fire at the American invaders, but slaughter your own compatriots?" Then, he shouted slogans: "Long live Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live Vietnam!" "Down with American imperialism!" "American invaders get out of South Vietnam!" Martyr Chen Wendang, like martyr Nguyen Van Troi, fought for the motherland and the people until his last breath.
    Martyr Da Deshan Wang was a Khmer and the vice president of the Buddhist Association of Tra Vinh Province. He was deeply indignant at the crimes of the American invaders and their lackeys in killing compatriots, murdering Buddhists, and destroying temples. In August 1960, he launched a struggle against the enemy's atrocities among Khmer monks and compatriots. He once led more than five thousand Khmer compatriots and monks to Tra Vinh City to hold demonstrations, rushing into the residence of the pseudo-provincial governor, demanding the restoration of the freedom of arrested monks and compatriots, demanding an end to the suppression and persecution of compatriots and monks, and opposing the shelling of villages and temples.
    Martyr Da Deshan Wang served as the Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front during his lifetime and enjoyed high prestige among Khmer and Kinh compatriots. After his death, Khmer monks, compatriots, and Kinh compatriots were deeply saddened and determined to learn from his example and resolutely fight the American imperialism and its lackeys to the end.
    Martyr Li Wenbei was a patriotic Cao Dai priest who actively led Cao Dai followers to participate in the struggle against America and for national salvation, making outstanding achievements. In February of last year, he was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Ben Tre Province National Liberation Front Committee. On April 4th of last year, he was unfortunately surrounded by the enemy in a battle and gloriously sacrificed himself.

    他们永远活在南越人民的心中
    南越民族解放阵线中央追赠陈文当等三烈士铜墙勋章
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团最近决定，把一级铜墙勋章追赠给陈文当烈士和大德山望烈士，把二级铜墙勋章追赠给黎文北烈士，以表扬他们在抗美救国斗争中作出的重大功绩。
    陈文当烈士是岘港市的一个年青的电工。一九六四年十月他参加西贡—嘉定区解放军后，在战斗中起模范作用，工作、学习积极，不怕困难，不怕苦，一贯良好地完成上级交给的任务。
    去年三月二十二日，他在执行任务中不幸被捕。敌人对他施加种种酷刑并且多方进行威胁利诱，但他为人民，为祖国而战斗和牺牲的决心毫不动摇，始终没有在敌人面前吐露出半点秘密，表现了革命战士的高贵品质。
    最后，敌人判处他死刑。去年六月二十二日早晨，当敌人要把他押到刑场上去时，他从容不迫，毫无惧色，把自己的衣物包好，送给一位难友，然后换上一套新衣服，整理好头发，从容地走上囚车。在刑场上，他英勇不屈，严词痛骂敌人：“我一个人死了，但南方一千四百万同胞会起来反对你们。”“你们手里拿着枪，为甚么不向美国侵略者开火，却来屠杀自己的同胞？”接着，他高呼口号：“胡志明万岁！”“越南万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国侵略者从越南南方滚出去！”陈文当烈士象阮文追烈士一样，为祖国和人民战斗到最后一息。
    大德山望烈士是高棉族人，茶荣省佛教会副会长。他对美国侵略者及其走狗残杀同胞、杀害佛教徒和破坏寺庙的罪行非常愤慨，一九六○年八月，他在高棉族僧侣和同胞中发起了反对敌人暴行的斗争。他曾经率领五千多名高棉族同胞和僧侣到茶荣市举行示威游行，冲入伪省长住宅，要求恢复被逮捕的僧侣和同胞的自由，要求停止镇压和迫害同胞和僧侣，反对炮击村庄和寺庙。
    大德山望烈士生前曾担任越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会副主席，在高棉族同胞和京族同胞中享有很高的威信。他逝世后，高棉族僧侣、同胞和京族同胞非常痛惜，决心学习他的榜样，坚决同美帝国主义及其走狗斗争到底。
    黎文北烈士是一位爱国的高台教士，积极带领高台教徒参加抗美救国的斗争，作出了出色的成绩。去年二月，他被选为槟椥省民族解放阵线委员会副主席。去年四月四日，在一次战斗中，他不幸落入敌人的包围圈而光荣牺牲。
