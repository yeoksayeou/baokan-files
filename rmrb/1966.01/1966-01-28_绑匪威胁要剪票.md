	After a period of so-called "peace offensive" failed, the Johnson government is now attempting to use the resumption of bombing of North Vietnam to carry out war blackmail against the Vietnamese people. Rusk and his ilk, a bunch of responsible officials of the American government, have issued blatant shouts, just like bandits threatening to tear up the ticket. It is truly shameless.
	However, this despicable act of the American ruling group not only completely exposes the "peace talks" trickery of the Johnson government, but also actually announces the bankruptcy of the Johnson government's "peace talks" trickery.
	For more than a year, American imperialism has carried out frantic bombing of North Vietnam, vainly attempting to use bombs to force the Vietnamese people to submit. That didn't work. Then it tried to use the so-called "bombing pause" to lure the Vietnamese people into submission. That still didn't work. So it resumed bombing again, which didn't work, and then "paused bombing" again. Whether bombing or pausing, it's all for blackmail. Bombing, pausing, bombing, pausing, bombing. This repetitive process shows that American imperialism's policy of war blackmail is rendered useless in the face of the unyielding Vietnamese people. Now, the Johnson government wants to use the resumption of bombing to threaten the Vietnamese people. This fully exposes the American aggressors' exhaustion of tricks.
	It must be pointed out that every time the Johnson government engages in a "bombing pause," it is for the sake of further expanding the bombing. The shouts now emanating from Washington are precisely a signal of American imperialism's expansion of the war. However, American imperialism must understand that the Vietnamese people are prepared for its "gradual escalation" on the road of aggressive war. As the Vietnamese people have repeatedly stated, their iron will is unwavering. No matter what the circumstances, no matter what type of war, the Vietnamese people will certainly defeat the American bandits.

    绑匪威胁要剪票
    约翰逊政府搞了一阵所谓“和平攻势”，未能得逞，又妄图以恢复对越南北方的轰炸来对越南人民进行战争讹诈。腊斯克之流的一帮美国政府负责官员，纷纷发出露骨的叫嚣，就象绑匪威胁要剪票一样，真是无耻透顶。
    但是，美国统治集团的这种卑鄙的行径，不仅彻底拆穿了约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局，而且实际上也是宣布约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局破产了。
    美帝国主义对越南北方进行了一年多狂轰滥炸，妄想用炸弹来迫使越南人民屈服，不行，它又想用所谓“暂停轰炸”来诱使越南人民屈服，还是不行，于是又恢复轰炸，不行，又“暂停轰炸”。轰炸也好，停炸也好，都是为了讹诈。炸、停、炸、停、炸，这种反复的过程，表明了美帝国主义战争讹诈政策，在坚强不屈的越南人民面前无所施其技。现在，约翰逊政府又想用恢复轰炸来对越南人民进行威胁，这充分暴露了美国侵略者的黔驴技穷。
    必须指出，约翰逊政府每一次搞“暂停轰炸”，都是为了更加扩大轰炸。现在从华盛顿发出的叫嚷，正是美帝国主义扩大战争的信号。但是，美帝国主义必须明白，越南人民对于它在侵略战争的道路上的“逐步升级”，是作好准备了的。正如越南人民一再表示的，他们的钢铁决心是坚定不移的，不管在任何情况下，不管是什么类型的战争，越南人民都一定把美国强盗打败。
