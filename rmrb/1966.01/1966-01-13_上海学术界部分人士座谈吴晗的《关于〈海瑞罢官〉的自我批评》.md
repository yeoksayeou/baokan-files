    Editor's Note: On December 31st of last year, the "Wenhui Bao" invited some people from Shanghai's historical and literary circles to discuss Comrade Wu Han's article "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'." At the meeting, various different views were put forward on Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism and related issues in this discussion. Now, the minutes of the symposium published by the "Wenhui Bao" on January 7th of this year are excerpted below.
    Zhou Yutong (Deputy Director of the Institute of History, Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences):
    The current practice of newspapers has some problems worth studying. I think how many problems are there in this discussion, we can line them up and introduce them. Currently, some articles have many repetitive views. It is suggested that in future discussions, the arguments can be lined up first, the published ones can be summarized in time, and then some new problems can be raised. For example: 1. Drama and history are related, but how exactly are they related, can be discussed. 2. The issue of where the incorruptible officials' butts are sitting, this seems to be clear to the historical community. Currently, some people say that incorruptible officials are worse than corrupt officials, this point can still be discussed. If so, in the era of the Chiang bandit gang, is it better to be a bad professor than a good professor?
    Among students, there is the problem that corrupt officials are better than incorruptible officials. Now middle school students are also raising this question, and history teachers in middle schools are suffering from not knowing how to teach it. China's feudal society has three thousand years of history, and the changes in class composition are also very large. Therefore, the historical figures of feudal society should be analyzed concretely. A total negation of the history of feudal society will submerge a part of the world's excellent culture. Now we ourselves don't pay much attention to our own historical and cultural heritage, but the enemy, American imperialism, is desperately studying the history of the Ming Dynasty, and Japan is also paying close attention to the study of Chinese history, even organizing companies to study Tang Xuanzang. In the future, to study the history of Chinese feudal society, one will have to draw materials from foreign sources.
    I have read Wu Han's self-criticism article. I know Wu Han well, he is very straightforward, his writing is like his person, he admits his mistakes frankly, and his admission is not fake. But some things in the article are strange, how can anti-rightist be associated with Hai Rui? Where has his political sensitivity gone? Wu Han is a good person, an "incorruptible official," but his political sensitivity is a big problem.
    Zhou Gucheng (Professor of the History Department, Fudan University):
    First, whether there are incorruptible officials, and if so, whether they are in the same gang as corrupt officials, whether they are worse than corrupt officials, this is an unresolved issue. It is generally not easy to accept that incorruptible officials are worse than corrupt officials, but if you have to say that incorruptible officials are better than corrupt officials, what is good about them, no one has made it clear so far, so these important key issues can still be brought out for debate. Second, the articles published now are not rebutting this one or that one, they are not sharp enough, not energetic enough, not satisfying enough. Third, this discussion can be used as an opportunity to expand the scope of historical issues. For example, the relations of production in the feudal era can be studied, and the problem of "touxian" (submission of land) can be discussed. "Touxian" not only existed in the Ming Dynasty, but also possibly in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, not only in China, but also in Western Europe with "submission." Chinese troops, disciples, former officials, retainers, etc. can all be studied. The feudal property relations in the Middle Ages can be studied well, the problem of "touxian" seems to have commonality in various countries in the world, it has a global nature, these issues can continue to be discussed. In addition, now the Hai Rui issue is fighting a war of annihilation, of course, the war of annihilation is very good, it can solve the problem, but don't just fight the war of annihilation, guerrilla warfare can also be fought. While discussing Hai Rui, you can also do some other topics, and let everyone see the unpopular ones, the unpopular ones may not be unpopular for some readers. Many articles on Hai Rui have already been published. I think the discussion page does not have to have a certain pattern. Whichever article proactively raises the issue, publish it as the headline. Now we still need different opinions to be more targeted, so that those of us who read it will be satisfied.
    I don't have a good evaluation of Wu Han's article. I have criticisms of his "self-criticism," the second paragraph in the article is defending himself, as for the evaluation of incorruptible officials, it is not resolved in the article, it only says that incorruptible officials and corrupt officials are in the same gang, then what is good or bad; the third paragraph raises many questions that he wants others to solve for him. Wu Han once insisted that historical dramas should conform to historical reality, but when writing the script of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he did not emphasize this, which is self-contradictory.
    Jiang Xingyu (Drama Studio of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture):
    Wu Han's self-criticism is actually a counter-criticism against Yao Wenyuan. Wu's article seems to divide himself into two everywhere, but in fact it separates motive and effect, politics and academics, world view and historical view. The second paragraph of the article is the core, but the possibility of its establishment is probably non-existent.
    In the past, I also beautified Hai Rui and considered the issue of incorruptible officials. It seems that incorruptible officials not only refer to economic integrity, but also have connotations such as integrity (having justice), incorruptibility (not being greedy), and clarity (not being muddled). The antonyms of incorruptible officials include cruel officials, corrupt officials, and muddled officials.
    What we feel difficult about this discussion on the issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is how should we divide Hai Rui into two? Some say that we cannot divide negative characters into two. Some say that affirming that Hai Rui served the feudal ruling class means negating that Hai Rui did good things for the people. This is of course very right, but is it a way of dividing into two? Some say that Hai Rui has two hands, one big stick and one carrot; repairing the Wusong River is the carrot, and shackling seven or eight people at the gate of the yamen is the big stick. Some say that phenomena and essence are divided into two, Hai Rui appears to serve the people, but in essence he serves the feudal ruling class. Is dividing into two applicable to specific historical figures? Is dividing into two a universal truth?
    Tan Qixiang (Director of the History Department, Fudan University):
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has made a big mistake. After more than fifty days of discussion, the results are great, which is very beneficial to the academic community, improving everyone's understanding, educating many people with confused minds, including myself. Now, it is feared that few people will agree with Wu Han being right. What's more, Wu Han has already come out to make a self-criticism, no matter whether his self-criticism is sufficient or deep enough, it is unlikely that anyone will still support "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Other issues can be discussed freely.
    The issue of incorruptible officials is very worth discussing. Compared with corrupt officials, is it better for incorruptible officials to exploit less, or more? Is it better to oppress lightly, or heavily? From this, we can further raise the question, that is, in addition to the leaders of peasant uprisings, are there any characters in the feudal ruling class who are worth affirming? Yue Fei and Wen Tianxiang are national heroes, and everyone affirms them. In addition, are there any feudal figures who are not related to national contradictions who are worth affirming?
    Furthermore, criticizing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is one issue, and how to evaluate Hai Rui is another issue; but now some people, because they negate "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," completely negate Hai Rui as a person. In fact, the two are not the same thing and should be distinguished.
    Finally, I will talk about some views on Wu Han's self-criticism. I read this article in a hurry and didn't see it very clearly. He said that "On Hai Rui" was written to oppose right-leaning opportunism. I don't understand what relationship Hai Rui has with opposing right-leaning. A large part of Wu Han's self-criticism article is the second part, it is still clinging to the return of land and anti-hegemony, and has not seriously examined the fundamental issue, examining what position he is speaking from. Taking the return of land as an example, Wu's article still has many logical problems. Wu Han's self-criticism article puts the cart before the horse, it should not have written the second paragraph so long, making it the main body, while avoiding talking about the fundamental issue—from what class position is he speaking.
    Liu Dajie (Professor of the Chinese Department, Fudan University):
    Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism, although he also admitted some mistakes, is not profound at all. He replaces examination with defense, covers up essence with phenomena, and is also contradictory, making it difficult to justify himself. The author not only continues to propagate those old views, but also uses defense to counter-criticize in many places.
    Secondly, for literary and artistic works, the first thing to pay attention to is the issue of political inclination. However, in his self-criticism, the author only talks about phenomena and does not touch the essence regarding this important issue, thus opposing motive and effect, and separating politics and academics. At the beginning of the article, he listed a schedule of writing time, nothing more than wanting readers to believe that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has nothing to do with politics and has no purpose. But strangely, he himself said that his "On Hai Rui" has a political motive, and was written to oppose right-leaning opportunism (in fact, it serves right-leaning opportunists), so why is the purpose of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," which was written on the basis of "On Hai Rui," "unclear" and "confused"? In his "Some Questions on Historical Dramas," he said that writing historical dramas (also referring to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"), "In a word, it is not for the dead, but to serve the living, that is, to inherit the fighting experience and lessons of the predecessors, so that they can serve today's socialist construction, so as to make the past serve the present." But in his self-criticism, he said that when writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "The principles of 'making the past serve the present' and 'valuing the present over the past' were not thought of at all at that time, it was entirely for the sake of the past and for the sake of writing a play," how can this be believed? His "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was of course written with feeling, as Comrade Fang Qiu's article published in the "People's Daily" said, this reflects a trend of anti-socialist thought at that time. Comrade Wu Han avoids talking about this fundamental issue; instead, he says that his mistake is, "In a word, I forgot class struggle." Is that so? No. He not only did not forget class struggle, but also actively participated in class struggle, but stood on the side of the bourgeoisie. As for him saying that he has firmly stood on the political class position, and that there are still problems with the class position of academic thought, it is also wrong to completely separate politics and academics like this.
    Regarding the "incorruptible official" issue, everyone is very concerned. Comrade Yao Wenyuan put forward that "Fundamentally speaking, no matter how 'incorruptible' or 'good' 'incorruptible officials' are, they can only be 'incorruptible officials' and 'good officials' of the landlord class that implements dictatorship over the peasants, and it is impossible to be the opposite." From the perspective of class boundaries, this is completely correct. Some people think that this is a completely negative nihilistic attitude towards historical figures, and I think this can only be a misunderstanding. First of all, admitting that "incorruptible officials" and "corrupt officials" are the same in class essence, and are the same as tools of feudal class dictatorship, does not mean that there is no place for them to be distinguished and evaluated in other aspects. To treat specific historical figures, we must conduct concrete analysis, and the primary issue is to draw clear class boundaries. We must never say that a feudal landlord class governor is the savior of the peasant class. Recently, everyone has often talked about Yue Fei. In fact, his problem is not simple either. At that time, the national crisis was unprecedentedly serious, and the anti-Jin Volunteer Army in the Hebei area was surging. Under the situation where the broad masses of the people strongly demanded resistance against the Jin, Yue Fei established contact with the anti-Jin Volunteer Army and received strong support from them, and he actively participated in the anti-Jin struggle himself. He has been praised in this regard. But if we attribute this matter solely to Yue Fei alone, then it is completely wrong. At the same time, he also has a side of feudal morality of loyalty to the emperor, which should be criticized. As for him suppressing Yang Mo's rebel army in the class struggle, he completely became an enemy of the peasant class here. If Yue Fei is to be written as a play, it will also be wrong to handle it improperly.
    Regarding the issue of "incorruptible officials," Comrade Fang Qiu's article talks about it more comprehensively. I agree with his view. The issue of "incorruptible officials" is more complicated, and many people are concerned about it. I hope that in future discussions, more articles on this aspect will be published.
    Li Junmin (Director of the Shanghai Editorial Office of Zhonghua Book Company):
    There is a difference between incorruptible officials and corrupt officials, and the good or bad of historical figures should still be distinguished. Corrupt officials are actually dregs, not worth mentioning, while incorruptible officials are the essence of the feudal era, and their influence is also great. This influence is not good, so the more essence it is, the more it should be criticized. It is also reasonable to say that incorruptible officials are worse than corrupt officials. From the perspective of revolutionaries, corrupt officials and bullies are easy to deal with, while so-called "incorruptible officials" are difficult to deal with. Hai Rui is different from enlightened gentry. Enlightened gentry have a revolutionary side under certain conditions. The reformism of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao should be affirmed in the early stage, Hai Rui was also a feudal diehard at that time, and should not be affirmed so much.
    Wu Han said that some people call themselves oppositionists, and call themselves Hai Rui, no matter what his own attitude is, it can be seen that these people always need "Hai Rui." Wu Han's articles and plays about Hai Rui have adapted to the needs of right-leaning opportunists who claim to be Hai Rui, and have played a role that they cannot play.
    Wu Han says that "sometimes he is sober" and "sometimes he is confused," which is "two combining into one." He uses materials to speak, but is it possible to "rather wrong the rural elites"? Wu Han's self-examination is actually using the "materials" of dead people to argue with the living, defending himself, which is far from a true self-criticism.
    Shu Shicheng (Professor of the History Department, East China Normal University):
    The editor's note in the "People's Daily" when publishing Wu Han's self-criticism article is different from the first "Editor's Note" when publishing Yao Wenyuan's article. This time it is completely targeted at Wu Han, meaning to thoroughly discuss the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and other issues will be discussed slowly.
    The more I read Wu Han's self-criticism, the more I feel something is wrong. He first listed a schedule. Why list it? It is to prepare to deny the debt: the script of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was written in 1960, not to satirize reality. This is a clumsy attempt to conceal something. Who is being scolded in his "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor"? Why scold? This article was written precisely when right-leaning opportunism was raging. I was originally very forgiving of him, but when he said in his self-criticism that his political position was stable, and that it was just an issue of academic thought, I don't believe he is politically reliable. He said that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was made in a confused way, which can be said to make sense. We also have this situation, while studying Marxism-Leninism, we are spreading bourgeois ideology while teaching. Wu Han is no smarter than us, he will naturally serve the bourgeoisie, he has not forgotten class struggle, but is engaged in class struggle, his fundamental position has not moved, and the root cause of the error in academic thought is precisely due to the instability of his political position, and the two cannot be separated. We cannot think that because it is a contradiction among the people, it is nothing great. We should still face our own problems squarely.
    Yang Kuan (Deputy Director of the Institute of History, Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences):
    Comrade Wu Han separated motive and effect, concealing the true intention of creation. He said that he was against right-leaning opportunism, but where is there any content in his "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," "On Hai Rui" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" that truly opposes right-leaning opportunism? Wu Han also said that writing this play was "for the sake of the past, for the sake of writing a play," and that people who study ancient history "for the sake of the past" may exist, but Wu Han has long advocated "making the past serve the present," and that writing historical plays should focus on "the enlightenment for future generations." Writing this play cannot be without purpose.
    Wu Han also completely separated the connection between politics and academics, concealing the political position of creating this play. Wu Han said that his class position in politics is firm, but his position in academics is wrong. Is it possible for a person to have two completely different positions in politics and academics?
    In order to persist in his past mistakes, Wu Han also conducted counter-criticism. The second part of the article is completely a counter-criticism against Yao Wenyuan. Wu Han talked a lot about the social specialization of the Suzhou-Songjiang area at that time, believing that the "class contradiction was the contradiction between peasants and rural officials, not the contradiction between ordinary peasants and landlords," that is to say, the peasants only had contradictions with some rural officials in the landlord class, not with the entire landlord class, which seriously distorted the main contradiction of feudal society. Wu Han also said that "peasants suing rural officials for seizing property is a low-level form of class struggle." If "peasants suing rural officials for seizing property" is class struggle, wouldn't it mean that the "upright officials" who accept the lawsuit have become "fair people" who handle and resolve class contradictions? Regarding such lawsuits as class struggle can only be a serious distortion of class struggle. In fact, the main ones who sued rural officials for seizing property were generally small and medium landlords, it is impossible for most of them to be peasants. Even if suing is a kind of class struggle, the majority at that time were landless poor peasants, and the peasants who had land and were seized and went to sue could only be a minority. Can these few people represent the class struggle of the peasant class by going to sue? At that time, the class struggle between the broad masses of peasants and landlords was indeed very sharp, mainly the struggle between the landless and land-poor peasants and the landlord class, and it had already developed into the masses directly attacking the landlords, which can be proved by many facts. Why did Wu Han turn a blind eye?
    Wu Han still insists on his original erroneous views, claiming that his views on "incorruptible officials" have basically not changed. Saying that "incorruptible officials" are called "Qingtian" (just officials), is "a judgment made by the people." As we all know, in feudal society, peasants and the landlord class had irreconcilable struggles due to the opposition of class interests, but Wu Han believes that "incorruptible officials" can make the interests of these two antagonistic classes "consistent." Wu Han also said that Hai Rui's "return of land" not only conformed to the feudal laws and maintained the interests of the feudal ruling class, "but also benefited the peasants who had been taken away their land." If the law really could maintain the interests of the landlords and benefit the peasants at the same time, then the law would become "for all the people," and the feudal dynasty would become a "national state for all the people." In short, judging from this article, Wu Han's ideological system has not changed in essence. In the name of self-criticism, it is actually a counter-criticism, and is continuing to propagate his fallacies.
    Wei Jianyou (Director of the History Department, Shanghai Normal College):
    Regarding how to further deepen the discussion on the issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," some comrades mentioned that we must grasp the main issues and start debates, distinguish right from wrong, and not get bogged down in minor issues. This is very important. It is of little significance to spend too much effort arguing about some minor issues. In order to avoid such situations, there is no need to draw conclusions lightly on certain minor issues that you are not very confident about. For example, saying that there were no peasants in the return of land, and the Wusong River was not repaired, is neither convincing nor easy to cause entanglement.
    Much of Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism is defending himself. The purpose of the first paragraph is to prove that his writing of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and articles such as "On Hai Rui" had nothing to do with the class struggle situation in 1961 and 1962, and that he was responding to the Party's call to oppose right-leaning opportunism. This kind of mechanical arrangement by time, regardless of ideological substance, of course cannot solve the problem. The second paragraph of the article, which accounts for two-thirds of the entire article, is the focus of the entire article. He refuted the criticisms of him on many specific issues, but some were self-contradictory, such as exaggerating the impact of the return of land while saying that the return of land had no effect; some were seemingly right but actually wrong, such as saying that the class contradiction in the Suzhou-Songjiang area was the contradiction between peasants and rural officials, not the contradiction between ordinary peasants and landlords. Here, he is actually trying to explain that: (1) "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" wrote about class struggle, because it wrote about suing, and suing is also a low-level form of class struggle; (2) Hai Rui carried out the return of land according to the principle of rather wronging the rural officials than wronging the common people, and in order to protect the interests of the peasants, he would rather let the rural officials be "wronged a little"; (3) The script had emphasized that Hai Rui was a bureaucrat who completely stood on the position of the feudal ruling class, but he was just too prominent, which caused readers and viewers to have another understanding. Therefore, the so-called forgetting class struggle, the so-called class position problem, is difficult to understand.
    Zhang Jiaju (Deputy Director of the History Department, Shanghai Normal College):
    Wu Han's self-criticism is written very awkwardly, and many places are self-contradictory. I agree with everyone's view that he is defending himself. The article seems to admit some mistakes, but in the specific analysis, it negates all these mistakes.
    This article has four major points:
    First, try every means to defend his political motives, such as listing a schedule, the articles about Hai Rui were mostly written around 1960, when there was no trend of reversing verdicts or the individual farming trend; "On Hai Rui" was written to cooperate with opposing right-leaning opportunism, the motive was very good, but the objective effect was not good; and he said that his political position was very stable, and his academic position was bourgeois, completely separating political issues from academic issues.
    Second, deny that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" advocates class reconciliation, the script wrote about peasants suing, this is also class struggle, the return of land is an accompaniment, and getting rid of bullies is the theme.
    Third, emphasize the role of incorruptible officials, and he believes that his view of incorruptible officials is correct, which is emphasized in the second and third parts of the article. He reiterated his previous argument that the good deeds done by incorruptible officials are consistent with the interests of the people. That is to say, his evaluation of incorruptible officials and Hai Rui is not wrong.
    Fourth, he believes that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" also divides Hai Rui into two, his repayment of imperial grace and respect for Confucius and Mencius have already been criticized, but the readers have not understood it.
    Wu Han is conducting counter-criticism from these four aspects, and many of the arguments have problems. For example, saying that "troublemakers" are all peasants, but in "Wanli Yehuo Pian", "troublemakers" mainly refer to the "scholars" and the like.
    Xu Delin (Professor of the History Department, East China Normal University):
    Wu Han's point of view and position have basically not changed, this is my view of his self-criticism article.
    I will only talk about two points of experience here. First, this criticism is good for Wu Han and for all of us. Wu Han said that his political position has been stable for more than 20 years, and that only his academic position has problems, separating politics and academics. But he is an expert in Ming history, and he thinks independently in academics. Once he thinks independently, the old things come out intact. I myself also have experience. Sometimes, I think I have the most research on things, and I give the most independent thought to them, so the mistakes are also the biggest. Independent thinking is very important, but it must be based on proletarian political thought. Politics and academics are closely related. If the worldview is not transformed, not only will mistakes be made in academics, but it will also be difficult to guarantee that there will be no problems in politics.
    Second, the best way to evaluate historical figures is to determine several principles. If some problems can be solved in this study and discussion, the worldview can also be transformed a bit as a result. This is good for everyone.
    Chen Xiangping (Deputy Director of the Shanghai Editorial Office of Zhonghua Book Company):
    The title of Wu Han's article is "Self-Criticism," but it does not match the content. As everyone pointed out, there are many issues worth discussing. I will add a few more comments. In the preface to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and in the article "On Hai Rui," he stated that he wanted to make the past serve the present, so it can be seen that the writing was purposeful, and he announced it very clearly. Wu Han now says that it was "for the sake of the past." This turn cannot be made.
    Wu Han wants us to learn from Hai Rui's spirit of daring to struggle. But may I ask what is the opposite? Who is today's Jiajing? Who is Xu Jie? Who is the hypocrite? Readers have the right to ask. Wu Han has a clear idea in his mind. Wu Han claims that writing Hai Rui was to oppose right-leaning opportunism. Comrade Fang Qiu said it well, this statement is divorced from the entire article. In fact, what he wants to promote is precisely what the right-leaning opportunists said. Didn't the right-leaning opportunists say that the people's communes were established too early and were done poorly?
    Wu Han also said that the theme after the revision of the script was "getting rid of bullies," and "the return of land was relegated to a secondary position." But in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," what is written from beginning to end is the return of land, saying that after the land is returned, there will be a good life. Killing Xu Ying is just a plot. The plot cannot replace the theme. The theme of returning land in the play is very clear. Even in terms of the historical "return of land" issue, what Hai Rui wanted to return was the land that violated the law, while the land of the big landlords was mainly annexed and occupied under the protection of the law, and the land that was submitted was only a part of the land that was occupied in violation of the law. How much was "returned"? Hai Rui himself said, "First take away a hundred, now compensate one, the compensation is very little." The result is "the poor are still poor" and "the rich are still rich." Wu Han is not unaware of this historical fact. Then why write this play that promotes that there will be a good life after the land is returned? It can be seen that the statement of writing the play for the sake of writing the play and writing for the sake of the past is self-contradictory. The essence of this play is to promote class reconciliation, it is to satirize the present by using the past, and it is to inherit feudal morality, feudal ideas, characters, and institutions.
    Wu Han claims that he did not satirize the present by using the past, but in fact he is an old hand at satirizing the present by using the past. He has written many articles satirizing the present by using the past in the past, which played a role in the democratic revolution. The stance of these articles written now has not changed, but the objects and methods are different. This is the essence of the problem. Wu Han said, "I forgot class struggle!" This is his modest remark, I don't think he has forgotten it at all.
    In his "Self-Criticism" article, Wu Han does not talk about the real purpose and practical role of writing this play, but only talks about the historical issue of returning land and the evaluation of Hai Rui in history, wanting to start a debate in this regard. He said, "My political stance is firm, I just overvalued Hai Rui." Is that really the case?
    Wu Han said that he did not see Hai Rui clearly in the past, and now he knows that he is a reformist. Everyone knows that reformism is a bourgeois thought. If there was reformism in the feudal era, then Hai Rui would not be able to be counted. Hai Rui is precisely the most stubborn, most conservative, the strongest in feudal principles, and the most determined to defend the law. Saying that he is a reformist is a unique view.
    After reading the script written by Wu Han, and now reading his "Self-Criticism" article, I feel that there are some important issues in it that are still very debatable.

    编者按：去年十二月三十一日，《文汇报》邀请上海史学界、文艺界部分人士，座谈吴晗同志的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》一文。会上对吴晗同志的这篇自我批评和这场讨论中的有关问题，提出了各种不同的看法。现将《文汇报》今年一月七日发表的座谈纪要节载于后。
    周予同（上海社会科学院历史研究所副所长）：
    目前报纸的做法有一些问题还值得研究。我觉得这次讨论里究竟有多少问题，可以排排队，介绍一下。目前有些文章有许多重复的见解。建议今后讨论论点可以先排排队，把已发表的及时总结一下，再提出一些新的问题。例如：一、戏剧和历史有关系，但关系究竟怎么样，可以讨论。二、清官屁股坐在什么地方的问题，这对史学界来说似乎已经清楚。目前有人说清官比贪官更坏的问题，这一点还可以讨论。这样说，那么，在蒋匪帮时代，是否做坏教授比做好教授要好吗？
    学生中存在着贪官比清官好的问题。现在中学生也提出这个问题，中学教历史的教师苦在不知如何教法。中国封建社会便有三千年历史，阶级成份的变动也很大。因此，对封建社会的人物要作具体分析。全盘否定封建社会的历史，那将要把世界上优秀的一部分文化淹没了。现在我们自己对自己的历史文化遗产倒不大注意了，敌人美帝国主义拼命在研究明史，日本也很注意中国史的研究，甚至在组织会社研究唐玄奘。将来要研究中国封建社会的历史，只好取材外国资料了。
    吴晗的自我批评文章，我看了。吴晗我是熟的，他很爽直，文如其人，有错就认了，他的认错不是假的。但是文中有些奇怪，反右倾怎么会联想到海瑞上面去的？他的政治敏感性到哪里去了？吴晗是好人，是“清官”，但他的政治敏感性大有问题。
    周谷城（复旦大学历史系教授）：
    第一，清官有没有，有的话与贪官是不是一丘之貉，是否比贪官更坏，这是没有解决的问题。清官比贪官更坏，一般不易接受，但是一定要说清官比贪官好，好在什么地方，目前还没有谁讲得清，因此这些重要的关键问题还可拿出来辩论。第二，现在发表的文章还不是这篇驳那篇，还不够针锋相对，没有劲，不过瘾。第三，借此讨论之机会可以使历史问题的讨论范围扩大一些。例如，封建时代的生产关系可以研究一下，投献问题就是可以讨论的。投献不仅明代有，魏晋南北朝也可能有，不仅中国有，西欧也有“投奔”。中国的部曲、门生，故吏、食客等都可研究。中世纪的封建财产关系可以好好地研究一下，投献问题在世界各国似有共同性，有世界性，这些问题都可继续讨论。此外，现在海瑞问题在打歼灭战，当然歼灭战很好，能解决问题，但是也不要只打歼灭战，游击战也可以打一些。在海瑞讨论的同时也可搞些其他的题目，冷门也可让大家看看，冷门对某些读者来说不一定是冷门。海瑞的文章已经发表得很多了。我觉得讨论版面不必有一定的格局。那篇主动提出问题，就把那篇发头条。现在还需要不同意见针对性强些，我们看的人才过瘾。
    对于吴晗的文章，我没有好评。我对他的“自我批评”有批评，文中第二段是为自己辩护，至于清官评价问题，文中没有解决，只是说了清官、贪官一丘之貉，那么有什么好坏呢；第三段提出了不少问题是要人家给他解决。吴晗当初曾坚持历史剧要符合历史真实，但写《海瑞罢官》的剧本又不强调了，是自相矛盾了。
    蒋星煜（上海市文化局剧目工作室）：
    吴晗名为自我批评，实际上是对姚文元反批评。吴文好象处处对他自己一分为二，实际上割裂了动机和效果、政治和学术、世界观和历史观。文章第二段是骨子，但成立的可能性恐怕不存在。
    过去我也曾美化海瑞，考虑过清官问题。看来，清官不光是指经济上的清，而有清正（有正义）、清廉（不贪污）、清明（不糊涂）等涵义，清官的对称包括酷吏、贪官、糊涂官。
    对这次《海瑞罢官》问题的讨论，我们感到困难的，是对海瑞应怎样一分为二？有的说对反面人物不能一分为二。有的说肯定海瑞为封建统治阶级服务，否定海瑞为人民做了好事。这样说当然很对，是否就是一分为二的提法？有的说海瑞是两手，一手大棒，一手胡萝卜；修吴淞江是胡萝卜，衙门口枷七、八人是大棒。有的说现象和本质一分为二，海瑞现象上为人民服务，本质上为封建统治阶级服务。对具体历史人物是否适用一分为二？一分为二是否普遍真理？
    谭其骧（复旦大学历史系主任）：
    《海瑞罢官》犯了很大错误，经过五十多天的讨论，成绩很大，对学术界很有好处，提高了大家的认识，使许多头脑糊涂的人受到教育，也包括我在内。现在要找赞成吴晗是对的人，怕很少了。何况吴晗已经站出来检讨，不管他检讨得够不够，深不深，有人再要拥护《海瑞罢官》，不大可能。其他问题，可以大放一下。
    清官问题，很值得讨论。清官，和贪官比较，是剥削少点好，还是多点好？压迫轻点好，还是重一点好？由此还可以进一步提出问题，即历史上除农民起义领袖外，在封建统治阶级范围内有没有值得肯定的人物？岳飞、文天祥是民族英雄，大家都肯定。此外和民族矛盾没有关系的封建人物，有没有值得肯定的？
    再有，对《海瑞罢官》的批判是一个问题，如何评价海瑞又是一个问题；但现在有些人因为否定《海瑞罢官》，连海瑞这个人也根本否定了，其实两者不是一码事，应该分一分。
    最后，对吴晗的自我批评谈些看法。这篇文章看得很匆忙，没有很好看清楚。他说《论海瑞》是为反对右倾机会主义写的，我弄不懂海瑞和反右倾有什么关系。吴晗的自我批评文章，大量篇幅是第二部分，它还是扭在退田、反霸上，没有对根本问题好好检查，检查自己是站在什么立场上说话的。就以退田来讲，吴文还存在很多逻辑问题。吴晗这篇自我批评文章轻重倒置，不该把第二段写得那么长，成为主体，而对根本问题——站在什么阶级立场说话却避而不谈。
      刘大杰（复旦大学中文系教授）：
      吴晗同志的自我批评，虽说也承认了一些错误，但很不深刻。他是以辩解代替检查，以现象掩盖本质，而又前后矛盾，很难自圆其说。作者不仅仍旧宣扬了那些旧观点，还有不少地方，是用辩解来进行反批评。
    其次，对于文艺作品，首先要注意的是政治倾向问题。而作者在自我批评中，对于这个重要问题，只谈现象，不接触到本质，因而把动机和效果对立起来，把政治和学术割裂开来。他在文章的开头，就排了一张写作的时间表，无非是要读者相信，《海瑞罢官》与政治无关，没有什么目的性。但奇怪的是：他自己说他的《论海瑞》，是有政治动机的，是为反右倾机会主义而作（其实是为右倾机会主义者服务的），何以在《论海瑞》的基础上写出来的《海瑞罢官》，反而目的性“不清楚”，反而“糊涂”起来了呢？他在《关于历史剧的一些问题》中说：写历史剧（也是指《海瑞罢官》），“一句话，不是为了死人，而是为活人服务，也就是为了继承前人的斗争经验教训，使之为今天的社会主义建设服务，作到古为今用。”但在自我批评中，他又说在写《海瑞罢官》的时候，“‘古为今用’‘厚今薄古’的原则在当时一点也没有想起过，完全是为古而古，为写戏而写戏”，这怎能叫人相信？他的《海瑞罢官》当然是有感而发，正如《人民日报》刊的方求同志文章所说，这反映了当时一股反社会主义的思潮。吴晗同志对于这个根本性的问题，避而不谈；反而说，他的错误，“一句话，我忘记了阶级斗争”。是不是这样的呢？不是。他不仅没有忘记阶级斗争，而且还积极地参加了阶级斗争，不过是站在资产阶级一边而已。至于他说：政治上的阶级立场他是站稳了的，学术思想上的阶级立场还有问题。这样把政治和学术完全割裂开来，也是错误的。
    关于“清官”问题，大家都很注意。姚文元同志所提出来的“从根本上说，不论‘清官’、‘好官’多么‘清’、多么‘好’，他们毕竟只能是地主阶级对农民实行专政的‘清官’、‘好官’，而决不可能相反。”从阶级界限来说，这是完全正确的。有人认为这就是对于历史人物采取了完全否定的虚无主义态度，我认为这只能是一种误解。首先承认“清官”、“贪官”在阶级本质上是同一的，作为封建阶级专政的工具是同一的，这并不等于说，他们之间在其他方面就没有可以区别、可以评价的地方。对待历史上的具体人物，必须进行具体分析，首要的问题，是划清阶级界限。决不能把一个地主阶级的巡抚大官，说成是农民阶级的救星。近来大家常常谈到岳飞，其实他的问题，也并不简单。当时民族危机空前严重，河北一带的抗金义军，风起云涌。在广大人民强烈要求抗金的形势下，岳飞同抗金义军取得联系，并得到他们的大力支援，自己积极参加了抗金斗争，他在这一方面受到了人们的称赞。但如果我们把这件事只归功于岳飞一人，那就完全错误了。同时，他又存在着忠君的封建道德的一面，这又是应当批判的。至于他在阶级斗争中，镇压杨么起义军，他在这里就完全成为农民阶级的敌人了。要把岳飞写成剧本，处理不当，同样是要犯错误的。
    关于“清官”问题，方求同志的文章谈得比较全面。我同意他这种看法。“清官”问题比较复杂，关心的人也很多，希望在今后讨论中，多发表几篇这方面的文章。
    李俊民（中华书局上海编辑所主任）：
    清官和贪官有区别，历史人物的好坏还是要有区别的。贪官实际上是糟粕，不在话下，而清官是封建时代的精华，影响也大，这种影响并不好，所以越是精华越要批判。清官比贪官坏，也有道理，从革命者立场来看，贪官、恶霸好对付，所谓“清官”难对付。海瑞同开明绅士又不同，开明绅士在一定条件下有革命性一面。康有为、梁启超的改良主义在初期应肯定，海瑞在当时也是封建顽固派，不应肯定那么多。
    吴晗说有些人自封反对派，自封海瑞，不论他自己态度如何，可见总是这些人需要“海瑞”。吴晗写海瑞的文章和剧本，适应了自命为海瑞的右倾机会主义者的需要，起了他们所不能起的作用。
    吴晗称“有时候是清醒”，“有时候又糊涂”，是“合二而一”。他拿资料讲话，但“宁屈乡宦”可能不可能？吴晗的检讨实际是用死人的“资料”来和活人争辩，为自己辩解，这同真正的自我批评相差太远了。
    束世澂（华东师范大学历史系教授）：
    《人民日报》发表吴晗自我批评文章的按语和发表姚文元文章时的第一个《编者按》有所不同，这次的完全针对吴晗，意思要把《海瑞罢官》这个剧本讨论透，别的问题慢慢来。
    吴晗的自我批评我越看越不对头。他先是排了张时间表。为什么排，就是准备赖账：《海瑞罢官》的剧本是一九六○年写的，不是影射现实。这是欲盖弥彰。他的《海瑞骂皇帝》骂的是谁？为什么要骂？这篇文章恰恰就是在右倾机会主义闹得凶的时候写的。我本来很原谅他，但他在自我批评中说自己政治立场是稳的，只是学术思想的问题，我就不相信他政治上靠得住。他说《海瑞罢官》是糊里糊涂搞出来的，这倒可以说得通，我们也有这种情况，一面在学习马克思列宁主义，一面在教书时却散布资产阶级思想。吴晗也不比我们高明，他会自然而然地替资产阶级服务，他并没有忘记阶级斗争，而是在搞阶级斗争，他的根本立场没有动，学术思想的错误根源正是由于政治立场的不稳，不能把两者分开。不能因为是人民内部矛盾，就没有什么了不起，还是应该正视自己的问题。
    杨宽（上海社会科学院历史研究所副所长）：
    吴晗同志把动机和效果割裂开来，隐蔽了创作的真正意图。他说自己是为了反对右倾机会主义，可是在他的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《论海瑞》和《海瑞罢官》中，哪里有真正反对右倾机会主义的内容呢？吴晗又说写这个戏是“为古而古，为写戏而写戏”，搞古史的人“为古而古”的或者有之，但吴晗早就主张“古为今用”，写历史戏要着眼于“对于后一代的人们的启发作用”。写这个戏不能没有目的。
    吴晗又把政治和学术的联系完全割裂开来，隐蔽了创作这戏的政治立场。吴晗说政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的，只是学术上的立场错了，难道说，一个人在政治上和学术上会有两个绝然不同的立场吗？
    吴晗为了坚持过去的错误，还进行了反批评。文章的第二部分完全是对姚文元的反批评。吴晗大谈其当时苏松地区的社会特殊化，认为那里“阶级矛盾是农民对乡官的矛盾，不是一般农民对地主的矛盾”，也就是说，农民只是和地主阶级中一部分乡官有矛盾，不是和整个地主阶级有矛盾，这就严重歪曲了封建社会的主要矛盾。吴晗还说“农民告乡官夺产是阶级斗争的一种低级形式”。如果“农民告乡官夺产”是阶级斗争，岂不是接受告状的“青天大老爷”成了处理和解决阶级矛盾的“公正人”了？把这样的告状看作阶级斗争，只能是对阶级斗争的严重歪曲。实际上，告乡官夺产的主要是一般中小地主，不可能多数是农民的。就算告状是一种阶级斗争，在当时，无地的贫苦农民是大多数，有地被夺而去告状的农民只能是少数，这少数人去告状，就可以代表农民阶级的阶级斗争吗？当时当地广大农民和地主的阶级斗争确很尖锐，主要是无地少地的贫苦农民与地主阶级的斗争，而且已经发展到群众直接打击地主的斗争，这是有许多事实可以证明的，为什么吴晗视而不见呢？
    吴晗仍然坚持原有的错误观点，声称对“清官”的看法基本未变。说“清官”叫作“青天”，是“人民作了鉴定”。众所周知，封建社会里农民和地主阶级，就是由于阶级利益的对立产生了不可调和的斗争，而吴晗却认为“清官”能够使得这两个对抗阶级的利益都“一致”。吴晗又说海瑞的“退田”，既符合封建王法，维护封建统治阶级利益，“同时，对于被白夺去田地的农民来说，也是有好处的”。如果王法真是既能维护地主利益，又能使农民有好处，那末，王法就成为“全民”的了，封建皇朝就成为“全民国家”了。总之，从这篇文章来看，吴晗的思想体系，本质上未有改变，名为自我批评，实际上是反批评，而且是在继续宣扬他的谬论。
    魏建猷（上海师范学院历史系主任）：
    关于《海瑞罢官》问题的讨论，如何进一步深入开展，有的同志提到必须抓住主要问题展开争论，分辨是非，不要扭在枝节问题上。这一点很重要，费太多力气去争辩一些枝节问题，是意义不大的。为了避免发生这类情况，对于某些枝节问题而自己又无甚把握的，不必轻下结论。例如：说退田中没有农民，吴淞江没有修，既没有说服力，也容易引起纠缠。
    吴晗同志的自我批评，有许多是为自己辩护。文章的第一段，目的是在证明他写《海瑞罢官》及《论海瑞》等文章，都和一九六一、一九六二年的阶级斗争形势无关，他是响应党的反右倾机会主义的号召。这种机械地按时间排比，不论思想实质，当然解决不了问题。文章的第二段，占全篇分量二分之一，是全文的重点所在。他就许多具体问题反驳了对他的批评意见，但有些是自相矛盾的，如一面说退田没有效果，一面又竭力夸张退田的影响；有些是似是而非的，如说苏松地区的阶级矛盾是农民对乡官的矛盾，不是一般农民对地主的矛盾。在这里，他实际上是企图说明：（一）《海瑞罢官》是写了阶级斗争，因为写了告状，告状也是阶级斗争的一种低级形式；（二）海瑞搞退田，是按着与其屈小民宁屈乡官的原则处理的，为了维护农民利益，宁可让乡官“屈一点”；（三）剧本曾强调了海瑞是完完全全站在封建统治阶级立场上的官僚，只是把他突出过分了，才使读者观者会产生另一种理解。因此所谓忘记了阶级斗争，所谓阶级立场问题，就很难索解了。
    张家驹（上海师范学院历史系副主任）：
    吴晗的自我批评写得很别别扭扭，许多地方自相矛盾。我同意大家的看法，他在为自己辩白。文章好象承认一些错误，但在具体分析中，却把这些错误都否定了。
    这篇文章有四大要点：
    一、想方设法为自己的政治动机辩白，如排了个时间表，有关海瑞文章大都在一九六○年前后写的，那时还没有翻案风，单干风；《论海瑞》是为了配合反对右倾机会主义写的，动机很好，只是客观效果不好；又说自己的政治立场很稳，学术立场是资产阶级的，把政治问题与学术问题截然分开。
    二、否认《海瑞罢官》宣扬阶级调和论，剧本写了农民告状，这也是阶级斗争，退田是陪衬，除霸才是主题。
    三、强调清官的作用，自己对清官的看法是对的，这在文章的第二第三部分都着重说明了这点。再一次重复了他以前的论点：清官所做的好事，和人民利益一致。也就是说，他对清官和海瑞的估价没有错。
    四、认为《海瑞罢官》对海瑞也是一分为二的，他的报圣恩、尊孔孟都已有批判，只是读者没有领会。
    吴晗就是从这四方面进行反批评的，其中很多论点都有问题。如说“刁民”都是农民，但在《万历野获篇》中，“刁顽”主要是指“秀才”之流。
    徐德嶙（华东师范大学历史系教授）：
    吴晗的观点立场基本没有变，这是我对他自我批评文章的看法。
    这里只说两点体会。第一，这场批判，对吴晗，对我们大家，都有好处。吴晗说自己二十多年来政治立场是稳的，只是学术立场有问题，把政治和学术分家。但他是明史专家，在学术上是独立思考的，一独立思考，旧东西就原封不动地出来了。我自己也有经验，有时自以为有研究的东西，独立思考发挥得最多，因此错误也最大。独立思考很重要，但必须以无产阶级政治思想为依据。政治与学术有密切联系，如果世界观不改造，不仅学术上会犯错误，也很难担保政治上不出问题。
    第二，评价历史人物最好是确定几条原则。这次学习、讨论中如果能够解决一些问题，也是世界观可由此得到一些改造。这对大家都有好处。
    陈向平（中华书局上海编辑所副主任）：
    吴晗的文章的题目称“自我批评”，但与内容对不起来。正如大家指出的，值得讨论的问题很多。我补充几点意见。他在《海瑞罢官》的序里和《论海瑞》的文章里都讲明是要古为今用的，可见写作是有目的的，他宣告得很清楚。吴晗现在却说是“为古而古”了。这个弯子是转不过来的。
    吴晗要我们学习海瑞敢于斗争的品质。但请问对立面是什么？谁是今天的嘉靖？谁是徐阶？谁是乡愿？读者有权要问。吴晗心中是有数的。吴晗自称写海瑞是为了反对右倾机会主义。方求同志说得好，这说法是和整篇文章游离的。其实他所要提倡的恰是右倾机会主义者所说的，右倾机会主义者不是说人民公社办早了，办糟了么？
    吴晗又说，剧本改定以后的主题思想是“除霸”，“退田退居陪衬地位”。但是在《海瑞罢官》中从头至尾写的是退田，讲退了田，有好日子过。杀徐瑛只是一个情节。情节是代替不了主题的。剧中退田的主题是非常鲜明的。即使就历史上的“退田”问题说来，海瑞要退的是违反王法的田，而大地主的田主要在王法保护下兼并、占有的，投献的田不过是违反王法占有的一部分。“退田”退了多少？海瑞自己说，“先夺其十百，今偿其一，所偿无几。”结果是“贫者自贫”，“富者自富”。这个历史事实，吴晗不是不知道的。那末为什么要写这个宣传退了田才有好日子过的戏？可见为写戏而写戏，为古而古的说法是自相矛盾的。这出戏的本质是宣扬了阶级调和论，是在借古讽今，是要把封建道德，封建思想、人物、制度都要继承下来。
    吴晗自称没有借古讽今，其实他是借古讽今的老手。他过去写过不少借古讽今的文章，在民主革命时起过一些作用。现在写的这类文章，立场没有变化，不过对象和方法不同罢了。这是问题的实质所在。吴晗说，“我忘记了阶级斗争！”这是他的谦逊之辞，我看一点也没有忘记。
    吴晗在他“自我批评”的文章里，不谈写这出戏的真实目的和现实作用问题，只谈历史上的退田问题，历史上的海瑞的评价问题，想在这方面展开辩论。他说，我政治上的立场是站稳了的，我不过把海瑞评价过高而已。问题真是这样么？
    吴晗说，对海瑞，过去看不清楚，现在才知道他是个改良主义者。大家知道改良主义是资产阶级的思潮。如果封建时代也有改良主义的话，那末海瑞是轮不到的。海瑞恰恰是最顽固，最保守，封建原则性最强，保卫王法最坚决的一个忠臣。说他是个改良主义者，这是一个独到的见解。
    看了吴晗写的剧本，这次又看了他的“自我批评”文章，我觉得里头有些重要问题还有大可讨论之处。
