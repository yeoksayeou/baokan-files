    The extrusion new technology for manufacturing high-power high-speed diesel engine crankshafts has been successfully tested at the Qishuyan Process Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways.
    High-power high-speed diesel engines are power equipment mainly used in internal combustion locomotives, ships, etc. The crankshaft is one of the key parts of a high-speed diesel engine. Thousands of horsepower of power must be transmitted through it. The quality of the crankshaft is very important for the diesel engine.
    Currently, the method used in our country to manufacture crankshafts is free forging. A crankshaft with a net weight of one ton requires a forging weighing five or six tons, and the crank throws of the crankshaft are carved out one by one through machining. Doing so turns a large amount of valuable steel into iron filings, wasting a great deal of manpower and material resources. At the same time, due to a large amount of processing, the metal fibers are cut off, and the crankshaft is prone to cracks and even fracture accidents.
    The advantage of using extrusion to manufacture crankshafts is that it can make the metal fibers continuous, which helps to improve the crankshaft's impact resistance and fatigue resistance, eliminate surface cracks, and extend its service life. Using this method to manufacture crankshafts can also save 60% of steel and a large amount of machine tool processing time, and increase production efficiency by five to ten times, due to the small amount of processing.
    Full-fiber crankshaft extrusion is the most advanced technology in the world for manufacturing crankshafts and is mastered by only a few industrially advanced countries. The Qishuyan Process Research Institute, in cooperation with the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant and the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant, successfully tested this new technology.

    制造大功率高速柴油机曲轴的最先进工艺
    全纤维曲轴挤压试验成功
    曲轴使用寿命延长，节省钢材，生产效率提高
    制造大功率高速柴油机曲轴的挤压新技术已经在铁道部戚墅堰工艺研究所试验成功。
    大功率高速柴油机是主要用于内燃机车、船舶等的动力设备。曲轴是高速柴油机的关键零件之一。几千马力的功率要靠它传递出去。曲轴的质量如何，对于柴油机关系很大。
    目前，我国制造曲轴采用的是自由锻造的方法。净重一吨的曲轴，要用五六吨重的锻件，经过机械加工，把曲轴的曲拐一个一个地抠出来。这样做，会使大量宝贵钢材变成铁屑，人力物力浪费很大；同时，由于大量加工，切断了金属纤维，曲轴容易产生裂纹，甚至发生折断事故。
    采用挤压方法制造曲轴，好处是可以使金属纤维连续不断，有助于提高曲轴的耐冲击和耐疲劳性能，消除表面裂纹，延长使用寿命。采用这种方法制造曲轴，由于加工量小，还能节省百分之六十的钢材和大量的机床加工时间，生产效率提高五到十倍。
    全纤维曲轴挤压是目前世界上制造曲轴的最先进的工艺，只有少数工业先进的国家掌握。戚墅堰工艺研究所是在戚墅堰机车车辆厂和齐齐哈尔车辆工厂的共同协作下，才试验成功这项新技术的。
