    Politics Produces Steel Pipes
    Shi Shengyu, Head of the Technology Group, Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory
    I was originally an ordinary lathe operator and began serving as the deputy head of the technology group in 1962. When we first accepted the task of trial-producing special-shaped steel pipes, some people said, "You local technicians have used up all your skills over the years, and you won't be able to come up with anything new anymore."
    We turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Some people said, "You can flip through Chairman Mao's works from Volume One to Volume Four, and you won't find a single sentence about how to trial-produce special-shaped seamless steel pipes." I said, "That's not right. Chairman Mao taught us to dare to make revolution, dare to struggle, and dare to win, giving us the thought of daring to scale new heights." Studying Chairman Mao's works made it clear to us that so-called skills and technical theories are not things that fall from the sky, but are generated from practical struggle. We acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings and, together with the veteran workers, finally produced the first batch of special-shaped steel pipes.
    I realized that a person's skills do indeed have an end, but if you listen to Chairman Mao and rely on the worker masses, your skills will never run out. I remember once, a customer came to the factory, urgently needing a batch of corrugated pipes that were elastic and could be bent, and wanted us to help trial-produce them. We had never even heard of this kind of corrugated pipe before, let alone trial-produced it. We discussed it with the master workers and believed that when facing complex steel pipe trial-production tasks that we had never encountered before, we should, as Chairman Mao taught, first, despise it strategically and dare to accept it; second, value it tactically and carefully ponder it.
    This kind of corrugated pipe requires hydraulic forming, which can easily lead to explosions if not handled properly. Before the trial production, we prepared the calculation data, safety data, and so on as much as possible, and everyone finalized the trial production plan, so as to be bold and careful, and fight a prepared battle. The first time we started the pressure test, it exploded unexpectedly with a "bang" in less than two minutes. We failed, but we didn't panic. We remembered Chairman Mao's words: "After suffering defeat, people also learn lessons from defeat, correct their ideas to make them conform to the laws of the external world, and people can turn defeat into victory. The so-called 'failure is the mother of success,' 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit,' is the reason." Every time we failed, we summed up the lessons. After several practices before and after, we finally produced the corrugated pipe, and we also mastered the technical rules.
    Listening to Chairman Mao's words and acting according to Mao Zedong Thought can produce steel pipes, conquer cutting-edge technology, and quickly master production rules.
    Now, we have initially mastered the production technology of special-shaped steel pipes such as cold drawing, cold rolling, and hydraulic forming.
    Looking back on the road I have traveled over the years, of all the things, Mao Zedong Thought in command is the first; of all the difficulties, with Mao Zedong Thought, nothing is difficult. This year, our factory has a heavier task of trial-producing new products, and there are more difficulties. We must redouble our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, so as to better complete new tasks.

    政治出钢管
    永鑫无缝钢管厂技术组组长　石圣钰
    我原来是一个普通车工，一九六二年开始担任技术组副组长。开始接受异型钢管试制任务的时候，有人说，你们这些土技术员，这几年来本事也用得差不多了，再也搞不出什么名堂来了。
    我们就向毛主席著作请教。有人讲，你在毛主席著作里，从第一卷到第四卷，翻来复去找，也找不出一句话是讲怎么试制异型无缝钢管的。我说不对，毛主席教导我们要敢于革命，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，给了我们敢于攀高峰的思想。学了毛主席著作，使我们明确，所谓本事，所谓技术理论，不是天上掉下来的，而是从实践斗争中产生的。我们按照毛主席的教导办事，和老工人一起，终于把第一批异型钢管试出来了。
    我体会到，一个人的本事的确是有用尽的时候，听毛主席的话，依靠工人群众，本事就永远不会完。记得有一回，厂里来了个客户，他们急需一批有弹性、能弯曲的波纹管，要我们帮助试制。这种波纹管，我们过去连听也没有听说过，更不用说试制了。我们和老师傅们一商量，认为对待从未碰过的复杂钢管试制任务，应该象毛主席教导的，第一，在战略上藐视它，敢于接受；第二，在战术上重视它，细心琢磨。
    这种波纹管，要采用液压成型，弄不好很容易爆炸。试制之前，我们把计算资料、安全数据等等尽可能准备好，大家把试制方案订好，做到胆大心细，打有准备的仗。第一次开始试压不到两分钟，“嘭”地一声，钢管却意外地爆掉了。失败了，但我们没有手忙脚乱。我们想起毛主席的话：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”每失败一次，我们就总结一次教训。这样前前后后几次实践，终于把波纹管生产出来了，技术规律也被我们掌握了。
    听毛主席的话，按毛主席思想办事，就能出钢管，就能攻下尖端，就能很快掌握生产规律。
    现在，我们已初步掌握冷拔、冷轧、液压成型等异型钢管生产技术。
    回顾自己这些年走过的道路，千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅第一条；千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。今年，我们厂新产品试制任务更重，困难也更多，我们要加倍努力活学活用毛主席著作，更好完成新的任务。
