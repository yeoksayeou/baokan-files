    A revolutionary measure in Chongqing Municipal Hospitals and Shenyang No. 1 Hospital
    Implementing "Doctor-Nurse Combination" for Better Patient Service
    Closer Doctor-Nurse Relations, Improved Hospital Ward Labor Organization, Further Aroused the Enthusiasm of Medical Staff, and Enhanced Medical Quality and Work Efficiency
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu) Chongqing's municipal hospitals are piloting a "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System," which has improved the labor organization of hospital wards, further aroused the enthusiasm of medical staff, and enhanced medical quality.
      The basic content of the "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System" is to form doctor-nurse teams composed of one doctor and two to three nurses, with the doctor as the team leader, collectively responsible for all medical care, nursing, ward management, and patient ideological work for fifteen to twenty beds. Each ward is divided into several doctor-nurse teams according to the number of beds, under the unified leadership of the department director and head nurse. There is both division of labor and cooperation between teams and between doctors and nurses. Doctors participate in some nursing work such as caring for critically ill patients, giving injections, and dispensing medicine. After nurses learn and master some medical techniques, they can also perform some treatment work while doing a good job in nursing.
    Implementing the "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System" is a reform in hospital work. In the past, doctors and nurses separately managed their respective tasks in isolation. Nurses only carried out nursing work according to the doctor's instructions, often without fully understanding the patient's condition or why such treatment was being performed. Doctors only made diagnoses and prescriptions, without participating in patient care, which also affected their comprehensive understanding of the patient. This was not conducive to comprehensively considering medical and nursing issues based on the patient's condition to improve the quality of medical and nursing work, nor was it conducive to fully leveraging the collective sense of responsibility of medical staff to be ultimately responsible for the patient. After implementing the "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System," each doctor-nurse team has a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition and treatment, and medical and nursing work is more thorough. Patients have responded positively.
    Implementing the "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System" can also improve work efficiency and create conditions for drawing more medical personnel to go deep into the countryside, factories, and mines, and participate in outpatient services.
    The implementation of the "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System" in various hospitals has also created good conditions for training medical and nursing cadres. After implementing this system, the direct responsibility of junior doctors for treating patients has been strengthened, and their ability to think independently and work independently has been cultivated. Doctors' participation in some of the nurses' work is also beneficial to overcoming the hierarchical concept between doctors and nurses and improving medical standards. The implementation of the "Doctor-Nurse Responsibility System" has also promoted the enthusiasm of nurses to study their profession, and the atmosphere of learning and studying medical and nursing skills has been universally strengthened. Through ward rounds with doctors, the explanation and concrete demonstrations by doctors, and personally performing some preliminary diagnoses and treatments, they receive effective training in practical work. Some departments also give lectures to nursing staff every week, combining diseases of each period to teach nurses about relevant etiology and treatment knowledge. Now, many nurses can differentiate some common diseases and make preliminary treatments.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) The departments of Shenyang No. 1 Hospital are piloting a doctor-nurse integration method to improve medical work, which not only strengthens the relationship between doctors and nurses but also improves the efficiency and quality of medical work.
    Medical treatment and nursing are two inseparable links in medical work, but this hospital has long had doctors only in charge of seeing patients, writing prescriptions, and writing medical orders, without participating in nursing work. Nurses were limited to giving injections, delivering medicine, and measuring body temperature, and some simple treatment work that could be done could not be participated in. In terms of organizational structure, each department also had a section for doctors and a section for nurses, each with its own office. Therefore, doctors and nurses did not have a comprehensive understanding of the patients' situation. This phenomenon is detrimental to improving medical quality and work efficiency. In order to better serve patients, the hospital has now changed the practice of mechanically separating doctors and nurses. The departments have merged the original offices of doctors and nurses, established doctor-nurse responsibility teams according to the wards, formulated a responsibility system in which doctors and nurses are jointly responsible for the patients, and implemented doctor-nurse integration.
    The doctor-nurse integration piloted by Shenyang No. 1 Hospital is not simply having doctors do the work of nurses or nurses do the work of doctors, but rather tightly integrating the two links of medical treatment and nursing. Doctors and nurses are jointly responsible for patients, jointly conduct ward rounds, write medical orders, and comprehensively analyze the condition. At the same time, on the premise of benefiting patient treatment and completing their respective tasks, doctors participate in some nursing work, and some nurses with longer work experience and rich clinical experience also do some treatment work within their capacity.
    In the several months since the departments of Shenyang No. 1 Hospital piloted doctor-nurse integration, not only has the relationship between doctors and nurses been strengthened, and the hierarchical concept between doctors and nurses has been initially broken, but also, because doctors and nurses are jointly responsible for patients and jointly conduct work, they have a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition and medical and nursing work. Therefore, the diagnosis of patients is more accurate than in the past, and treatment and nursing work are also more timely and effective.
    Shenyang No. 1 Hospital began piloting the doctor-nurse integration method in the obstetrics and gynecology department in August of last year. At that time, the hospital's Party organization mobilized medical staff to study articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." Everyone realized that this was an important measure to improve medical quality and better serve patients, and it was also an important aspect of realizing the revolutionization of the hospital. Soon, all departments of the hospital followed the example of the obstetrics and gynecology department and began piloting doctor-nurse integration.

    重庆各市属医院和沈阳市第一医院的一项革命化措施
    实行“医护结合”更好地为病人服务
    密切了医生护士关系，改进了医院病室劳动组织，进一步调动了医护人员积极性，提高了医疗质量和工作效率
    新华社成都电　重庆各市属医院试行“医护包干制”，改进了医院病室的劳动组织，进一步调动了医护人员的积极性，提高了医疗质量。
      “医护包干制”的基本内容是由一名医生和二三名护士组成医护小组，由医生任组长，集体负责十五至二十张病床的全部医疗护理、病室管理和病员思想工作。各个病室根据床位的多少分成若干医护小组，由科主任和护士长统一领导。小组与小组之间，医生与护士之间，既有分工又有合作。医生参加一些护理重病人、打针、发药等护理工作；护士学习并掌握了一些医疗技术后，在做好护理工作的同时，也可以作一些治疗工作。
    实行“医护包干制”是医院工作的一项改革。过去医生和护士各自孤立地分管各项工作，护士只是分头按照医生的嘱咐进行护理工作，往往对病人的病情和为什么要进行这样的治疗都不很了解；医生只作诊断处方，不参与病人护理工作，也影响对病人全面的了解。这样，不利于根据病人情况全面考虑医疗护理问题，以提高医护工作的质量，也不利于充分发挥医护人员的集体责任心，共同对病人负责到底。实行“医护包干制”以后，每个医护小组对病人的病情和治疗了解得更为全面，医护工作也更周到了。病人反映良好。
    实行“医护包干制”，还可以提高工作效率，为抽出更多的医务人员深入农村、工矿和参加门诊创造条件。
    各医院实行“医护包干制”也为培养医护干部创造了良好条件。实行这一制度后，加强了下级医生对治疗病人的直接责任，培养了他们独立思考问题和独立进行工作的能力。医生参加一部分护士的工作，对克服医生护士之间的等级观念和提高医疗水平也有好处。实行“医护包干制”，也促进了护士钻研业务的积极性，学习和钻研医疗护理业务的空气普遍加强。他们通过同医生一起查房，经医生的讲解和具体示范操作，并亲自作一些初步的诊断治疗，在实际工作中得到有效的培养。有的科室还每周为护理人员讲课，结合各个时期的疾病向护士讲有关病因和治疗知识。现在不少护士已能对一些常见疾病作出鉴别并能作初步的处理。
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳市第一医院各科病房试行医护结合的办法，改进医疗工作，既密切了医生和护士的关系，又提高了医疗工作的效率和质量。
    医疗和护理在医疗工作中是密切不可分的两个环节，但这个医院长期以来却是医生只管看病、开处方、写医嘱，不参与护理工作；护士只限于打针、送药、量体温，一些可以做到的简单的治疗工作也不能参加。各科在机构设置上也是医生一摊，护士一摊，各有各的办公室，因此，医生和护士对病人的情况了解都不全面。这种现象对提高医疗质量和工作效率是不利的。为了更好地为患者服务，这个医院现在改变了那种医护机械地分家的做法。各科病房合并了原来医生、护士的办公室，按病室分别成立了医护包干小组，制订了医生护士共同对患者负责的责任制度，实行医护结合。
    沈阳市第一医院试行医护结合，不是简单地让医生顶护士的工作，让护士顶医生的工作，而是把医疗和护理两个环节紧密结合起来，医生和护士共同对病人负责，共同查病房、写医嘱，综合分析病情。同时，在有利患者治疗和完成各自分工任务的前提下，医生参加一些护理工作，一些工龄较长、临床经验丰富的护士也做一些力所能及的治疗工作。
    这个医院各科病房试行医护结合几个月来，不仅密切了医生护士之间的关系，初步破除了医护之间的等级观念，同时，由于医生和护士共同对病人负责，共同进行工作，对病人的病情和医疗、护理工作有了全面的了解，因此，对病人的诊断比过去更准确，治疗、护理工作也更及时、有效了。
    沈阳市第一医院是从去年八月起由妇产科首先试行医护结合这个办法的。当时，医院党组织发动医护人员学习《纪念白求恩》《为人民服务》等文章，大家认识到这是提高医疗质量，更好地为病人服务的一项重要措施，也是实现医院革命化的一个重要方面。不久，医院各科病房都以妇产科为榜样，开始试行医护结合。
