    U.S. Intensifies War Preparations Under the Guise of “Peace”
    American Newspaper Reveals U.S. Military Authorities Are Preparing to Use Poison Gas More Extensively in South Vietnam
    U.S. Troops in Vietnam Frenziedly Implement a “Scorched Earth” Policy in South Vietnam
    (Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th) As America's "peace envoys" fly all over the place, Johnson is accelerating preparations to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The U.S. Selective Service announced on the 7th that it will draft another 29,400 men in February. A Selective Service spokesman also said that the authorities are considering further expanding the scope of conscription and even restoring the conscription regulations implemented during the Korean War. Since the plan to expand the army by 340,000 men was announced last August, the conscription authorities have repeatedly lowered conscription standards and stepped up the search for cannon fodder at home. On the same day, U.S. military transportation officials revealed that the United States is taking a series of "emergency measures" to accelerate the delivery of munitions and supplies to U.S. troops invading Vietnam. These officials revealed that the United States is currently accelerating the construction of ports and bases in South Vietnam, which will cost approximately $500 million and are expected to be put into use by the middle of this year. In order to solve the current problem of insufficient port and dock capacity in South Vietnam, the military transport department is dispatching a fleet of large barges towed by ocean-going tugs and many floating docks to South Vietnam.
    According to the *Wall Street Journal* on the 5th, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff are currently considering the more extensive use of poison gas in the South Vietnam war in order to "accelerate the end of the war." The newspaper said: "Military officials believe that the government's current 'peace offensive' does not preclude suggestions such as the more extensive use of poison gas in order to wage the war more vigorously."
    At the same time, senior U.S. officials have repeatedly issued war cries in recent days, attempting to intimidate the Vietnamese people. Wheeler, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has just concluded activities in South Vietnam and elsewhere, Brown, the Secretary of the Air Force, and Green, the commander of the Marine Corps currently in South Vietnam, have recently made successive speeches, stating that once the "peace" fraud goes bankrupt, the United States will resume bombing North Vietnam and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. Wheeler said on the 5th that if the United States "determines that the North Vietnamese are unwilling to negotiate," he would "definitely" recommend resuming bombing. On the 6th, when asked by reporters whether the United States would resume bombing North Vietnam, Brown said, "The purpose of our (suspending bombing) is entirely clear; if these purposes are not achieved, the result will be entirely clear as well."
    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 8th) While the U.S. imperialists are emitting a large "peace" smokescreen, they are frantically implementing a heinous "scorched earth" policy in the liberated areas of South Vietnam.
    According to the Associated Press, the U.S. military is now "directly involved" in the "scorched earth operations" to destroy the liberated areas of South Vietnam. "It is carrying out a plan to destroy the food supply for the Communist troops and the houses and crops in the areas where the Communist troops are hiding." "This extensive plan includes establishing arbitrary bombing zones in Viet Cong areas, destroying rice crops and burning other crops and housing in enemy areas (referring to the liberated areas)."
    The news agency said, "The plain south of the Dong Vang Co River, west of Saigon, is the main target of the 'scorched earth'." "Paratroopers from the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade began operations last weekend." "Not a single house was left within two miles of the paratrooper camp. Constant artillery bombardment and continuous air raids have turned every building into rubble." "They burned all the houses they saw, smashed all the cooking utensils, cut down all the banana trees, and smashed all the mats."
    Such barbaric atrocities by the U.S. aggressor troops are endless. According to UPI, two companies of U.S. troops once attacked a "settlement with only three thatched huts" in a rice paddy, "firing at least 2,500 shells" and "thousands of rounds of automatic weapons and rifle bullets poured onto these small thatched huts, one of which caught fire and was razed to the ground."
    The news said, "The burned-down thatched hut belonged to a seventy-year-old man and his wife, both of whom were farmers."

    美国在“和平”烟幕下加紧准备扩大战争
    美报透露美国军事当局竟准备在南越更广泛使用毒气
    侵越美军在南越疯狂地实行“焦土”政策
    据新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国的“和平使节”满天飞的时候，约翰逊正在加紧为扩大侵越战争作准备。
    美国征兵局七日宣布，二月份将再征兵二万九千四百人；征兵局发言人同时表示，当局正在考虑进一步扩大征兵范围，甚至恢复朝鲜战争期间实施过的征兵条例。从去年八月宣布扩军三十四万人的计划以来，征兵当局已经一再降低征兵标准，加紧在国内搜罗炮灰。同一天，美国军运部门官员透露，美国正在采取一系列“紧急步骤”来加速向侵越美军运送军火、物资。这些官员透露，美国目前正加紧在南越兴建港口、基地，这些工程共需花费约五亿美元，预计到今年年中就可交付使用；为了解决目前南越港口、码头不敷应用的问题，军运部门正在派出一队由远洋拖轮拖带的大驳船及许多浮动码头到南越去。
    据《华尔街日报》五日透露，美国参谋长联席会议目前正在考虑在南越战争中更广泛地使用毒气，以便“加速结束这场战争”。报纸说：“军方人士认为（美国）政府目前的‘和平攻势’并不排斥为了更加大力地进行战争而提出的诸如更广泛地使用毒气的这种建议。”
    同时，美国高级官员连日来纷纷发出战争叫嚣，妄图吓唬越南人民。刚刚结束在南越等地的活动的美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒、空军部长布朗以及目前正在南越的海军陆战队司令格林，最近接连发表谈话，表示一旦“和平”骗局破产，美国就要恢复对越南北方的轰炸和扩大侵越战争。惠勒五日说，如果美国“断定北越人不愿谈判”，他“肯定”会建议恢复轰炸。六日，在记者问到美国是否将恢复对越南北方的轰炸时，布朗说，“我们（暂停轰炸）的目的是什么，这是完全清楚的；如果这些目的达不到，结果将如何，这也是完全清楚的。”
    新华社八日讯　西贡消息：美帝国主义在大放“和平”烟幕的同时，正在疯狂地对越南南方解放区实行罪恶滔天的“焦土”政策。
    据美联社报道，现在美军已经“直接卷入”破坏南越解放区的“焦土行动”。“正在执行一项摧毁供给共产党部队粮食和隐藏共产党部队地区的房屋和庄稼的计划”。“这项范围广泛的计划包括在越共地区建立任意轰炸区、毁掉敌区（指解放区）的大米庄稼和烧毁其它庄稼以及住房”。
    这家通讯社说，“在西贡以西的东万古河以南的平原是‘焦土’的主要目标”。“美国第一七三空降旅的伞兵上周末已经开始行动”。“在伞兵营地两里之内没有留下一间房子。大炮不断的轰击和飞机不断的轰炸已经使每座建筑物都成为瓦砾”。“他们把看见的所有的房子统统烧光，所有炊事用具全被砸碎，所有的香蕉树都被砍了，所有的席子都被打烂。”
    美国侵略军的这种野蛮兽行，是层出不穷的。据合众国际社报道，两连美军曾经对一片稻田里“只有三所茅屋的居民点”进行袭击，“至少发射了两千五百发炮弹”，“数千发自动武器和步枪的子弹倾泻在这些小小的茅屋上面，其中一所着了火被夷为平地”。
    消息说，“这所被烧毁的茅屋是一位七十岁的老头和他的老伴的，他们都是农民”。
