    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: The following is the full text of the speech given today by Shigeharu Nakano, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association (AAJA), at a press conference. Dear colleagues:
    After the Secretariat of the AAJA was forced to temporarily withdraw from Jakarta, the permanent secretaries of the Secretariat came to Beijing to temporarily meet and discuss the convening of a full Secretariat meeting to decide on a temporary location and future work. We are very pleased to meet Chinese and many international colleagues here. Just now, Mr. Morrison, the Secretary from South Africa, gave everyone a brief introduction to the history of the AAJA. Now I would like to introduce the process of the Secretariat's withdrawal from Jakarta and the current work of the Secretariat to everyone as follows.
    During the two years that the AAJA Secretariat was located in Jakarta, with the enthusiastic and friendly help of the Indonesian people and the vast number of progressive journalists, the Secretariat did a lot of work for the common struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States, and for strengthening the unity of the Asian and African people and journalists. The Secretariat expresses its heartfelt thanks to the Indonesian friends. However, since the drastic changes in the situation in Indonesia in early October 1965, the work of the Secretariat has been repeatedly subjected to undue interference, and even the basic principles on which the Secretariat works have been violated. In the three months from October to December, the Secretariat encountered all kinds of interference and obstacles, its normal work could not be carried out, and even its normal contact with its members was impossible. Although we made various efforts to improve our situation, the result was more and more difficulties and interference. As the executive body of an international organization with forty-seven members, we must be responsible to our members and cannot allow this situation to continue. We were forced to decide to temporarily withdraw from Jakarta and to convene a full Secretariat meeting as soon as possible to report to all member countries of the Secretariat and to Secretary-General Djawoto. The All-China Journalists Association accepted our request and provided us with the convenience of coming to Beijing for a temporary meeting, and also gave us the opportunity to come to Mr. Djawoto's post to report to him, for which we express our deep gratitude.
    Recalling the life of the Secretariat in Jakarta since October 1965, it was extremely unpleasant. The obstacles we encountered in Jakarta were, first of all, not receiving or receiving telegrams and letters very late, and the telephone was also cut off. This cut off our contact with our members for three months. Although we hoped that this situation would improve, it could not be realized. The severance of contact has actually paralyzed our work.
    Another obstacle we encountered in Jakarta was slander. The *Angkatan Bersenjata* newspaper, published in Jakarta, published an editorial on November 4, 1965, groundlessly claiming that the leadership of the AAJA had been "seized by journalists of the 'September 30th Movement'." This made us see that the people who were conducting the slander wanted to drag our independent international organization into the whirlpool of Indonesian internal politics. We lodged a solemn protest against this.
    Another obstacle we encountered in Jakarta was the successive arrests of Indonesian personnel working in the Secretariat. First, Mr. Adnan, the Arabic translator, then Mrs. Francisca, the English-French translator, and finally Mr. Pintoro, the cashier. Mr. Pintoro was taken from his desk by Indonesian armed personnel who broke into the Secretariat's office without permission. This alone can explain the treatment received by our anti-imperialist and anti-colonial international organization. It can be said that our status has not been given due respect, and our work has not been given the minimum guarantee. Moreover, since the beginning of November, the rude behavior of the Indonesian armed forces has also been imposed on foreign secretaries. The Indonesian armed forces stationed in the "Press Building" where the Secretariat is located have repeatedly blocked, questioned, and made things difficult for foreign secretaries entering the building, subjecting us to insults.
    During this period, although we made representations to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs twice, on November 30th and December 14th, requesting the cessation of various obstructions and interferences and guaranteeing our minimum working conditions, this situation has not been improved. But later, the interference we received became even more.
    In early November 1965, the Indonesian Journalists Association was reorganized. The new leadership unilaterally announced the replacement of Mr. Yusuf as the acting Secretary-General of the AAJA. On November 30th, the new leadership of the Indonesian Journalists Association sent a letter to the Secretariat, announcing the replacement of Mr. Yusuf and dispatching a person named Arifin Pei, who had previously been a broadcaster for the "Voice of America," to replace Mr. Yusuf. Everyone knows that the AAJA was established at the First Asian-African Journalists Conference held in Jakarta in April 1963. This conference elected the executive body of the Association - the Secretariat. Mr. Djawoto of Indonesia, due to his contribution to the conference, was unanimously elected as the Secretary-General by all countries of the Secretariat. At the end of 1963, the Secretariat held its Second Plenary Meeting in Gadog, Indonesia. Considering that Mr. Djawoto had accepted a new appointment as the Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, the meeting unanimously agreed to Mr. Djawoto's recommendation and accepted Mr. Yusuf as the Deputy Secretary-General, acting as Secretary-General. The Secretariat has a responsibility to firmly defend the decision of the Plenary Meeting and prevent it from being violated. The Indonesian Journalists Association's unilateral decision to replace Mr. Yusuf as acting Secretary-General is completely illegal and a rude interference in the internal affairs of the Secretariat. The Secretariat firmly refuses to impose this decision on the AAJA and opposes this behavior that undermines the principle of consensus and violates the decisions of the Secretariat meetings.
    The current situation in the Indonesian press is as follows: hundreds of Indonesian journalists have been imprisoned, and dozens of newspapers have been closed down. This situation is still developing. The situation we faced in Indonesia was that the support, assistance, and friendly atmosphere from the Indonesian press that the Secretariat had received for more than two years were obstructed and destroyed, replaced by the insults and difficulties of the Indonesian armed forces against the Secretariat, the vicious attacks of the right-wing newspapers against the Secretariat, and the Indonesian Journalists Association's new leadership's increasingly serious interference in the internal affairs of the AAJA, making it impossible for the Secretariat to work according to the principles it firmly adheres to.
    After fully studying the above situation, we believe that in order to prevent the work of the Secretariat from stagnating and from being interfered with and destroyed, it is necessary to take the necessary measures. We need to convene a full Secretariat meeting as soon as possible, and it is actually impossible to prepare for the convening of this meeting in Jakarta. Therefore, we decided to temporarily withdraw from Jakarta. After the permanent secretaries left separately, they met as soon as possible in order to continue our work, which has been suspended for a long time.
    Thanks to the convenience provided by the Chinese colleagues, we have now met in Beijing. We have set up a temporary office at No. 523 of the Beijing Hotel, and we welcome colleagues, especially those from Asian and African countries, to contact us.
    We have now started work. We are currently actively preparing to convene the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Secretariat to discuss the issue of the temporary location and future work.
    I want to state that our meeting in Beijing is only temporary. The location of the temporary headquarters will be discussed and decided by the upcoming Plenary Meeting of the Secretariat. But at present, all our work will continue as before. We will continue to publish the journal *Asian-African Journalist*, and we will also continue to hold study classes to train journalists for Asian and African countries.
    This is what I want to introduce to everyone. Next, I want to talk about the new things that have happened after the Secretariat withdrew from Jakarta and the position of the Secretariat.
    According to a report by the Indonesian Antara News Agency on January 6, 1966, a meeting was held in Jakarta on December 24, 1965, with the participation of the Indonesian government, the Indonesian Journalists Association, and Mr. Yusuf. The new leadership of the Indonesian Journalists Association decided to let Arifin Pei undertake all the work and obligations of Yusuf and transfer power as soon as possible. The Secretariat firmly opposes this new interference by the Indonesian Journalists Association in the AAJA. As early as November 1965, the Secretariat, considering Mr. Yusuf's situation, decided that the powers of the Deputy Secretary-General should be collectively responsible by the Secretariat and jointly perform duties. Mr. Yusuf agreed to this decision. Therefore, any unilateral decision cannot change the above resolution of the Secretariat. The so-called "transfer of power" is illegal and has no binding force on the Secretariat. Mr. Yusuf was not authorized to represent the AAJA, and Mr. Yusuf participated in that meeting under violent pressure. According to a report in the Jakarta *Djiihad* newspaper on January 11, Mr. Yusuf has been arrested. This is enough to prove this point. The AAJA is an independent mass international organization. The so-called three-party talks between the Indonesian government, the Indonesian Journalists Association, and Yusuf have nothing to do with the AAJA. The Secretariat firmly opposes the new leadership of the Indonesian Journalists Association sending Arifin Pei to interfere in the internal affairs of the AAJA. In the future, any interference in the affairs of the AAJA by the new leadership of the Indonesian Journalists Association will be illegal and invalid.
    I would also like to state the Secretariat's attitude towards the editorial published in the Jakarta *Angkatan Bersenjata* on January 7, 1966. This editorial, on the one hand, continued to slander the AAJA as being "utilized by the elements of the 'September 30th Movement'," and on the other hand, "guaranteed" that the Secretariat could "smoothly perform its duties" in Jakarta, demanding that the Secretariat "reconsider" its decision to withdraw from Jakarta. We want to solemnly point out that this is completely a hypocritical attitude of the *Angkatan Bersenjata*. Since it falsely accused the AAJA Secretariat of being controlled by the journalists of the "September 30th Movement" long ago, then why would it ask the AAJA Secretariat to "reconsider" its decision to withdraw from Jakarta and guarantee that the Secretariat can "smoothly perform its duties" in Jakarta? Isn't this self-contradictory, proving that the slander that it had previously imposed on the AAJA was wrong? The *Angkatan Bersenjata*'s repeated groundless slander against the AAJA only clearly exposes the sinister conspiracy of certain forces in Indonesia, which is to try to drag the AAJA into the whirlpool of Indonesian internal politics, thereby achieving the goal of controlling the AAJA, and further splitting the progressive forces in the Asian and African press circles. The Secretariat's decision to temporarily withdraw from Jakarta is precisely to break this conspiracy and effectively defend the "Jakarta Declaration" of April 1963 and safeguard the fighting unity of Asian and African journalists. The Secretariat will never change its correct decision. Moreover, after three months of experience, we have fully understood what they mean by "guaranteeing" and "smoothly performing duties." We cannot believe their "guarantees." We only believe the facts that we have personally experienced.
    Before I end my speech, I would also like to introduce a situation to everyone. According to a report by the Indonesian Antara News Agency on January 11, the Central Council of the Indonesian Journalists Association, through Arifin Pei, issued a statement on the Secretariat's withdrawal from Jakarta. On January 10, the Jakarta *Putra Tanah Air* also published an article by Arifin Pei. The Secretariat wants to take this opportunity to respond.
    Arifin Pei's statement said that the Secretariat did not explain the withdrawal to the Indonesian government and the Indonesian Journalists Association. We want to declare that the AAJA is an independent international organization and has the right to handle its own affairs independently. Our published withdrawal statement is the best explanation. As I said before, the Secretariat has twice written detailed letters to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about its situation, but our situation has not been improved in any way. We requested to meet President Sukarno, but there were no arrangements until we left Jakarta. As for the new leadership of the Indonesian Journalists Association, they have been interfering with the Secretariat from the beginning. It is their actions that forced the Secretariat to withdraw from Jakarta. What else do we need to explain to them?
    Arifin Pei's statement also said that the Indonesian Journalists Association will ask Yusuf to report. Under the circumstances that Mr. Yusuf is in prison, can he have the freedom to express his true opinions?
    As for Arifin Pei's writing an article in the *Putra Tanah Air*, arrogantly insulting the Secretariat's withdrawal from Jakarta as being done by "a group of 'foreigners' who want to reduce the significance of international journalists' solidarity," this just shows how people like Arifin Pei view the collective action of the AAJA's executive body. The Secretariat's decision to withdraw from Jakarta is precisely to restore the international solidarity that has been severely "reduced" since October 1965. It seems that people like Arifin Pei should also learn to respect the facts.
    Thank you all.
    We are prepared to answer your questions.

    杉山市平介绍亚非记协书记处被迫撤离雅加达经过
    坚决反对粗暴干涉亚非记协内部事务
    严正抗议某种势力要把亚非记协拖入印度尼西亚内政漩涡
    新华社十五日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处书记杉山市平今天在记者招待会上的讲话。全文如下：亲爱的同业们：
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处被迫从雅加达暂时撤离后，书记处各常驻书记来到北京暂时会合，商讨召开书记处全体会议，讨论决定临时会址和今后工作问题。我们很高兴在这里会见中国的和许多国家的同业。刚才南非书记摩里逊先生已经向大家简要介绍了亚非新闻工作者协会的历史。现在我把书记处撤离雅加达的经过以及书记处当前的工作向大家作如下介绍。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处设在雅加达的两年多时间，在印度尼西亚人民和广大进步新闻工作者热情友好的帮助下，书记处为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争，为加强亚非人民以及新闻工作者团结做了许多的工作。书记处对印度尼西亚朋友们表示衷心感谢。但是，自一九六五年十月初印度尼西亚的局势发生急剧变化以来，书记处的工作却接连受到了不应有的干涉，甚至书记处据以工作的基本原则也受到侵犯。从十月到十二月三个月间，书记处遇到种种的干扰和阻难，它的正常工作无法进行，甚至它和自己会员的正常联系也无法进行。虽然我们作出了种种努力，希望我们的处境能够改善，但结果却遇到越来越多的困难和干涉。作为一个有四十七个会员的国际组织的执行机构，我们要对自己的会员负责，不能听任这种状况继续下去。我们被迫决定暂时从雅加达撤离，并且要迅速召开书记处全体会议，以便向书记处全体成员国以及总书记查禾多先生作出报告。中华全国新闻工作者协会接受了我们的要求，为我们到北京来临时会合提供了方便，也使我们有机会来到查禾多先生的任所来向他作报告，对此我们表示深切的感谢。
    回忆一九六五年十月以来书记处在雅加达的生活，是极不愉快的。我们在雅加达遇到的阻难，首先是收不到或被延搁很迟才收到电报和信件，而且电话也被切断。这就使得我们和会员之间的联系切断达三个月之久。尽管我们希望这种状况有所改善，却不能实现。联系的切断实际上已使我们的工作陷于瘫痪。
    我们在雅加达遇到的又一个阻难是遭受诽谤。在雅加达出版的《武装部队报》，在一九六五年十一月四日发表社论，毫无根据地说什么亚非新闻工作者协会的领导已被“九·卅运动”新闻工作者所夺取。这使我们看到：进行诽谤的人是要把我们这个独立的国际组织拖进印度尼西亚内政的漩涡。我们对此提出了严正的抗议。
    我们在雅加达遇到的又一个阻难，是在书记处工作的印度尼西亚人员接连被捕。最初是阿拉伯文翻译阿登南先生，其后是英—法文译员弗朗西斯卡夫人，最后是出纳员平托罗先生。平托罗先生是印度尼西亚武装人员未经许可，闯入书记处办公室，把他从办公桌上捕走的。仅仅这一件事已经可以说明我们这个反帝反殖的国际组织所受到的待遇，可以说，我们的地位没有受到应有的尊重，我们的工作没有得到起码的保证。而且自十一月初以来，印度尼西亚武装部队的无礼行为，也施加到外国书记身上，驻守在书记处所在地“新闻大厦”的印度尼西亚武装部队，对进入大厦的外国书记数次阻拦、盘问和刁难，使我们受到了侮辱。
    在此期间，我们虽然在十一月三十日和十二月十四日两次向印度尼西亚外交部申述了我们的处境，要求停止种种阻挠和干涉，保证我们有起码的工作条件，但这种状况始终没有得到改善。但是以后，我们受到的干涉就更加多了。
    一九六五年十一月初，印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会进行了改组。改组后的新领导成员单方面宣布了撤换亚非新闻工作者协会代总书记优素福先生。十一月三十日，印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会的新领导送了一封信到书记处，宣布撤换优素福先生，并派遣一个曾经担任过“美国之音”广播员的名叫阿里芬·佩的人接替优素福先生的职务。大家都知道，亚非新闻工作者协会在一九六三年四月在雅加达举行的第一次亚非新闻工作者会议上成立，这次会议选出了协会的执行机构——书记处。印度尼西亚的查禾多先生由于对会议的贡献，经书记处各国一致同意，担任总书记。一九六三年底，书记处在印度尼西亚的加多格举行第二次全体会议，考虑到查禾多先生接受了新的任命，担任驻中华人民共和国的大使，会议一致同意查禾多先生的推荐，接受优素福先生为副总书记，代理总书记职务。书记处有责任坚决维护全体会议的决定，使之不受侵害。印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会单方面宣布撤换优素福先生代总书记的决定，是完全非法的，是对书记处内部事务的粗暴干涉。书记处坚决拒绝把这种决定强加给亚非新闻工作者协会，并且反对这种破坏协商一致的原则、破坏书记处会议决定的行为。
    目前，印度尼西亚新闻界的情况是这样的：几百名印度尼西亚新闻工作者被监禁，几十家报纸被封闭。这种情况还在继续发展。我们在印度尼西亚面临的处境是，两年多以来，书记处得到的印度尼西亚新闻界方面的支持、帮助和友好气氛受到阻挠和破坏，代之而来的是，印度尼西亚武装部队对书记处的侮辱、作难，右翼报纸对书记处的恶毒攻击，印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导对亚非新闻工作者协会内部事务的日益严重的干涉，使得书记处无法按照自己所坚决遵循的原则工作下去。
    我们在充分研究了上述情况之后认为，为了使书记处的工作不再停顿，不再遭受干涉和破坏，不能不采取必要的措施。我们需要迅速召开书记处全体会议，而在雅加达实际上无法准备召开这次会议。因此我们决定暂时撤离雅加达，各常驻书记分别离开后，尽早会合，以便继续我们的业已停顿了很久的工作。
    感谢中国同业们给我们提供了方便，我们现在已经在北京会合了。我们已在北京饭店的523号设立了一个临时的办公处，欢迎各位同业特别是亚非国家的同业和我们联系接触。
    我们现在已经开始工作。目前正积极准备召开第四次书记处全体会议，以便讨论临时会址问题和今后工作。
    我要说明的是：目前我们在北京只是临时会合，关于临时会址选定何处，这要由将要召开的书记处全体会议讨论，然后才能作出决定。但在目前，我们的各项工作都将照旧进行，我们将继续出版会刊《亚非新闻工作者》，也将继续举办为亚非国家培养记者的学习班。
    我要向大家介绍的情况就是这些。下面我还要讲一讲书记处撤离雅加达之后新发生的事情以及书记处的立场。
    根据印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社一九六六年一月六日报道，一九六五年十二月二十四日在雅加达召开了由印度尼西亚政府、印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会和优素福先生参加的会议，印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导决定让阿里芬·佩承担优素福的全部工作和义务，并将尽快移交职权。书记处坚决反对印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会对亚非新闻工作者协会的这一新的干涉。早在一九六五年十一月，书记处考虑到优素福先生的处境，就曾决定副总书记的职权由书记处集体负责，共同执行职务。优素福先生赞成这个决定。因此，任何单方面的决定都不能改变书记处的上述决议。所谓
  “移交职权”是非法的，对书记处没有任何约束力。优素福先生并未被授权代表亚非新闻工作者协会，而且优素福先生是在暴力压迫下参加那次会见的。据雅加达《圣战报》一月十一日报道，优素福先生已经被捕。这更足以证明这点。亚非新闻工作者协会是一个独立的群众性国际组织，所谓印度尼西亚政府、印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会和优素福三方面的会谈，和亚非新闻工作者协会无关。书记处坚决反对印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导派出阿里芬·佩干预亚非新闻工作者协会的内部事务。今后印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会的新领导所作的任何干涉亚非新闻工作者协会事务的事，都是非法的和无效的。
    我还要对一九六六年一月七日雅加达《武装部队报》发表的社论表明书记处的态度。这篇社论一方面继续诽谤亚非新闻工作者协会“被‘九·卅运动’分子所利用”，一面又“保证”书记处可以在雅加达“顺利执行职务”，要求书记处“重新审议”撤离雅加达的决定。我们要严正指出，这完全是《武装部队报》的一种虚伪的态度。既然诬蔑亚非新闻工作者协会书记处早为“九·卅运动”的新闻工作者所控制，那么为什么还会要求亚非新闻工作者协会书记处“重新审议”撤离雅加达的决定，并保证书记处在雅加达“顺利执行职务”呢？这岂不是自相矛盾，自己证明自己从前所施加于亚非新闻工作者协会的诬蔑是错误的吗？《武装部队报》一再对亚非新闻工作者协会进行毫无根据的诽谤，只是清楚地暴露了印度尼西亚某种势力的险恶阴谋，那就是企图把亚非新闻工作者协会拖进印度尼西亚内政的漩涡，从而达到控制亚非新闻工作者协会的目的，由此进一步去分裂亚非新闻界的进步力量。书记处决定暂时撤离雅加达，正是为了打破这种阴谋，有效地保卫一九六三年四月“雅加达宣言”，维护亚非新闻工作者的战斗团结。书记处决不会改变自己作出的正确决定。而且，三个月的经历，我们已经充分了解了什么是他们所说的“保证”“顺利执行职务”，我们无法相信他们的“保证”，我们只相信我们所亲身经历的事实。
    在我结束我的发言之前，还要向大家介绍一个情况。根据印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社一月十一日报道：印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会中央理事会通过阿里芬·佩就书记处撤离雅加达发表了声明。一月十日，雅加达的《祖国之子报》还刊登了阿里芬·佩的文章。书记处要借此机会作出回答。
    阿里芬·佩的声明说：书记处没有把撤离的事向印度尼西亚政府和印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会作出说明。我们要申明：亚非新闻工作者协会是一个独立的国际组织，有权独立处理自己的事务。我们发表的撤退声明就是最好的说明了。我在前面已经说过，书记处曾经把自己的处境，两次详细写信给印度尼西亚外交部，但我们的处境却没有得到任何改善。我们要求见苏加诺总统，但直到我们离开雅加达时仍没有任何安排。至于印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会的新领导，从一开始就对书记处进行干涉，正是他们的行动迫使书记处不得不撤离雅加达，我们还要向他们说明什么呢？
    阿里芬·佩的声明又说，印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会将要求优素福作出汇报。在优素福先生被关在监牢里的情况下，他能有表达自己真实意见的自由吗？
    至于阿里芬·佩在《祖国之子报》上写文章，傲慢地侮辱书记处撤离雅加达是“某些想缩小国际新闻工作者团结意义的‘外国人’集团干的”。这恰好说明，阿里芬·佩这类的人是怎样看待亚非新闻工作者协会执行机构的集体行动的。书记处决定撤离雅加达，正是为了恢复它自一九六五年十月以来被严重
  “缩小”了的国际团结，看来，阿里芬·佩这类人还应当学会尊重事实。
    谢谢大家。
    我们准备回答各位的问题。
                              一九六六年一月十五日
