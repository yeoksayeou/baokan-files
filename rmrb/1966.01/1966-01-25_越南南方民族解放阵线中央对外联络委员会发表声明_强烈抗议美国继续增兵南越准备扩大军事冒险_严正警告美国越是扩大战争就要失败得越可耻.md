    Hanoi, January 24 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Central Foreign Liaison Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on January 21, strongly protesting the US imperialists' continued shipment of troops and war equipment into South Vietnam, preparing for new military adventures in Vietnam and the entire Indochina. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    On January 18, 1966, the US authorities sent another 9,000 combat troops to South Vietnam, including the 2nd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division stationed in Vung Tau and a Marine Corps regiment stationed in Chu Lai, south of Da Nang. Thus, in less than a month, the United States has sent more than 13,000 American expeditionary troops to South Vietnam. To date, the number of US troops illegally entering South Vietnam has reached more than 200,000, not including the US troops of the Seventh Fleet constantly operating in the South China Sea and more than 20,000 South Korean, Australian, and New Zealand puppet troops.

    US Secretary of Defense McNamara recently also declared that the United States will soon send an additional 500 personnel and 55 M48 heavy tanks equipped with 90mm cannons to South Vietnam.

    At the same time, the Johnson administration has requested the US Congress to add US$12.3 billion to the 1966-1967 war expenditure in South Vietnam, nearly doubling the previous year's war expenditure.

    Obviously, while the US imperialists are talking glibly about "peace," "returning to the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue," and "knocking on all doors to seek a negotiated settlement to stop the war in Vietnam," they are actually frantically intensifying and expanding their criminal war in South Vietnam to an extremely dangerous degree. The above actions once again expose the aggressive, bellicose, and cunning face of US imperialism, as well as its conspiracy to push the war in Vietnam to a more intense level. The essence of the Johnson-Rusk-McNamara group's "peace seeking" trick is nothing more than a trick played to deceive world opinion, attempting to use people's love of peace to cover up their sinister and malicious intentions, namely, to invade South Vietnam and turn it into a US military base in Indochina; and further to realize the conspiracy to occupy the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia through colonialist war.

    The new war actions taken by US imperialism, the chieftain of imperialism, show that it has suffered defeat and fallen into a predicament in the face of the powerful unity of the 31 million Vietnamese people who are determined to defeat the American robbers. The power of modern weapons and the vast national power of one of the most populous and richest countries in the world cannot conquer the 14 million people of South Vietnam, who, under the just banner of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front – the organizer and leader of the South Vietnamese people and the only legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people – have waged an unyielding struggle for five years.

    These new war actions of US imperialism, as well as its intensified bombing and sweeping of the Lao liberated areas, intensified military provocations against Cambodia, and increased troops and military bases in Thailand, show that it is preparing for new military adventures in Vietnam and the entire Indochina, making the already tense situation in the region even more tense.

    The Central Foreign Liaison Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front strongly accuses and severely condemns these extremely dangerous war actions of US imperialism to domestic and world opinion, to the American people and the people of all countries who are fighting for peace and justice and demanding that the US authorities fully implement the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue.

    We earnestly call on governments and all progressive groups and individuals to take practical actions to stop all war conspiracies and actions of US imperialism against Vietnam. It must stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam and let the South Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs.

    The Central Foreign Liaison Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front sternly warns US imperialism: No professional army, no modern weapon can save it from its already doomed defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The more it sends troops to South Vietnam, the more it intensifies and expands the criminal war in South Vietnam, the more shameful its defeat will be.

    The 14 million South Vietnamese people, united into a solid whole, under the just banner of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, with the sincere support of the 17 million blood brothers and sisters in the North and billions of people around the world who love justice and freedom, firmly grasp victory in their own hands, will resolutely fight to the end, concentrate hatred on bayonets and gun muzzles, overcome all difficulties, fight both special warfare and local warfare, no matter how long it takes, they are determined to defeat the aggression and treasonous conspiracies of US imperialism and its lackeys, strive for national independence, democracy, and national reunification, and contribute to the defense of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    As long as US imperialism refuses to act in accordance with the statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on March 22, 1965, the South Vietnamese people will never lay down their arms, they will be united as one and fight until final victory.

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央对外联络委员会发表声明
    强烈抗议美国继续增兵南越准备扩大军事冒险
    严正警告美国越是扩大战争就要失败得越可耻
    新华社河内二十四日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会二十一日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义继续把军队和战争装备运进越南南方，准备在越南和整个印度支那进行新的军事冒险。声明全文如下：
    一九六六年一月十八日，美国当局又向越南南方增派九千名战斗部队，其中包括驻在头顿的第二十五步兵师第二旅和驻在岘港以南朱莱的海军陆战队一个团。这样，在不到一个月的时间内，美国就派了一万三千多名美国远征军到越南南方。到目前为止，非法进入越南南方的美军已达二十万以上，这还不包括经常在南海海面活动的第七舰队的美军和两万多名南朝鲜、澳大利亚、新西兰仆从军在内。
    美国国防部长麦克纳马拉最近还宣称，美国将在最近增派五百人和五十五辆装备有九十毫米火炮的M48重型坦克到越南南方。
    同时，约翰逊政府还要求美国国会把一九六六——一九六七年度在越南南方的战争开支追加一百二十三亿美元，即把上一年度的战争开支款项提高近一倍。
    显然，美帝国主义在侈谈“和平”、“重新回到一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议上来”、“为寻求停止越南战争的谈判解决而敲所有的门”的时候，实际上却正在疯狂地把它在越南南方的罪恶战争强化和扩大到极其危险的程度。上述行动再一次暴露了美帝国主义的侵略、好战和狡猾的面目，以及把在越南的战争推向更加激烈程度的阴谋。约翰逊—腊斯克—麦克纳马拉集团的“谋求和平”把戏的实质，只不过是为欺骗世界舆论而玩弄的花招，妄图利用人们热爱和平的愿望来掩盖他们阴险和恶毒的企图，即侵略越南南方，把越南南方变成美国在印度支那的军事基地；并且进而实现利用殖民主义战争侵占整个印度支那和东南亚的阴谋。
    帝国主义的头子美帝国主义采取这些新的战争行动，表明了它在三千一百万越南人民决心打败美国强盗的强大团结力量面前遭到了失败，陷入了窘境。现代化武器的力量，世界上人口众多和最富有的国家之一的巨大国力，都征服不了一千四百万越南南方人民，他们在越南南方民族解放阵线——越南南方人民的组织者和领导者、越南南方人民唯一合法的代表——的正义旗帜下，五年来，进行了不屈不挠的战斗。
    美帝国主义这些新的战争行动，以及它加强对老挝解放区的轰炸扫射，加强对柬埔寨的军事挑衅和增加它在泰国的军队和军事基地等活动表明，它正准备在越南和整个印度支那进行新的军事冒险，使这个地区原来就很紧张的局势更加紧张。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会向国内和世界舆论，向正在为和平和正义而斗争、并且正在要求美国当局彻底履行一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议的美国人民和各国人民强烈控诉和严厉谴责美帝国主义这些极其危险的战争行动。
    我们恳切呼吁各国政府和一切进步团体、人士以实际的行动制止美帝国主义对越南的一切战争阴谋和行动。要它停止侵略越南南方的战争，让越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会严厉警告美帝国主义：没有任何一支专业军队，没有任何一种现代化武器可以挽救它在侵略越南战争中已经注定的失败。它越是向越南南方增派军队，越是强化和扩大在越南南方的充满罪恶的战争，它的失败就越可耻。
    团结成一个牢固的整体的一千四百万越南南方人民，在越南南方民族解放阵线的正义旗帜下，在一千七百万北方骨肉同胞和世界上几十亿热爱正义和自由的人民的真诚支持下，把胜利紧紧掌握在自己手中，将坚决战斗到底，把仇恨凝聚在刺刀上和枪口上，战胜一切困难，特种战争也打，局部战争也打，不管要打多长时间，他们坚决要挫败美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和卖国阴谋，争取民族独立、民主和祖国统一，为保卫印度支那和东南亚和平作出贡献。
    只要美帝国主义拒绝按着越南南方民族解放阵线一九六五年三月二十二日声明去做，越南南方人民就决不放下武器，他们将万众一心，一直打到取得最后胜利为止。
