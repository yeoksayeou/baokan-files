	Semiconductor Underground Metal Pipe Detector
	A semiconductor detector for measuring underground metal pipes has recently been manufactured at the Shanghai Zhongyuan Electrical Appliance Factory.
	This instrument is suitable for determining whether there are underground metal pipes, as well as their location and burial depth, during the expansion and renovation of factories. It can also be used to measure the laying of underground power cables.
	The development of the detector has added a pair of sensitive eyes to the maintenance of underground metal pipes and power cables in our cities. It can locate various metal pipes without excavation.

    半导体地下金属管道探测仪
    用来测量地下金属管道的半导体探测仪最近在上海中原电器厂制成。
    这种仪器适用于在扩建和改建工厂时，测定地下有无金属管道以及它们的位置和埋设深度。它还可以用来测量地下电力电缆的敷设情况。
    探测仪的制成，给我国城市地下金属管道和电力电缆的维修增添了一双灵敏的眼睛，不用挖掘，即可寻找到各种金属管道。
