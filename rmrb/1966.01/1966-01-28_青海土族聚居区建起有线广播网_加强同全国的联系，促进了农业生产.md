    Xinhua News Agency, Xining - Wired broadcasting has brought important international and domestic news, connecting the Tu people living in the deep mountainous areas of the Qinghai Plateau with the people of the whole country.
    In the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in the Daban Mountain area, 8,000 loudspeakers have been installed in the past two years, an average of one for every four households. Every morning and evening, the Tu people listen to important domestic and international news from the wired broadcasts. Many people, after hearing the victorious news of the Vietnamese people's struggle against the US and the atrocities of US imperialism on the broadcast, record them and spread them to everyone while working in the fields. They also pay close attention to reports on the construction situation in various parts of the motherland. After hearing about the heroic deeds of the Dazhai people and the situation of the Xiaogaoling Brigade, a Dazhai-style model unit in Qinghai Province, from the broadcast, they put forward the slogan "Learn from Dazhai from afar, learn from Xiaogaoling nearby," and set off a high tide of basic farmland construction in the mountainous area.
    The Tu are one of the smaller ethnic groups in China, with only about 70,000 people, mainly living in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in the Daban Mountain area in northwestern Qinghai Province.

    青海土族聚居区建起有线广播网
    加强同全国的联系，促进了农业生产
    据新华社西宁电　有线广播带来了国际国内的重要消息，把居住在青海高原深山区的土族人民同全国人民联系起来了。
    达坂山区的互助土族自治县，在最近两年中安装了八千个广播喇叭，平均每四户人家就有一个。每天早晚，土族人民从有线广播中收听国内国际的重要消息。许多人在广播中听到越南人民抗美斗争的胜利消息和美帝国主义的暴行，都记录下来，在田间劳动中向大家传播。他们也十分注意收听祖国各地的建设情况的报道。当他们从广播中听到大寨人的英雄事迹和青海省大寨式的模范单位小高陵大队的情况后，提出“远学大寨，近学小高陵”的口号，掀起了山地农田基本建设的高潮。
    土族是我国人数较少的民族之一，只有七万人左右，主要居住在青海省西北部达坂山区的互助土族自治县内。
