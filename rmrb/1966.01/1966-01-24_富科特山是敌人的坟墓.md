　　Phou Kout Mountain is the Graveyard of the Enemy
　　The steel warriors of the two patriotic forces of Laos fighting on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain have a slogan: "Turn our positions into graveyards for burying the enemy!" Now, on this heroic position, many invaders who came from the air and the ground have indeed been buried.
　　The American invaders have always regarded Phou Kout Mountain as an obstacle and a thorn in their side for invading the Xieng Khouang liberated area. In 1965, from New Year's Day to the end of the year, they launched one attack after another on this place. However, the heroic troops on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain fought bravely and tenaciously in the battles to repel enemy attacks, with flexible tactics, creating many brilliant achievements in annihilating the enemy's forces, and turning Phou Kout Mountain into a graveyard for burying the invading enemy. In the twenty days of fighting from November 11 to 30, 1965 alone, more than 150 enemy corpses were left on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain, and more enemies were wounded.
　　The heroic troops on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain gave full play to their heroic and resourceful characteristics, and were good at fighting close battles to annihilate the enemy in defense, repelling the enemy's attacks. In a battle in mid-November last year, two companies of the enemy, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, sneaked to only a few meters away from the forward positions of a certain unit of the Liberation Army. The calm soldiers suddenly launched a counter-charge with hand grenades, killing and wounding 26 enemies, and crushing the entire invading enemy force.
　　There are many examples of the heroes on the front lines of Phou Kout Mountain using flexible tactics to annihilate the enemy. At the beginning of 1965, the American puppet group began a frenzied bombardment of Phou Kout Mountain with a large number of planes and artillery from New Year's Day onwards. On January 7, the enemy launched an attack on Phou Kout Mountain with six battalions of troops, divided into three routes. One route launched a frontal attack, while the other two routes formed an encirclement from the flanks, attempting to capture the headquarters of the front-line troops on Phou Kout Mountain. At this time, the front-line headquarters of Phou Kout Mountain left a part of its forces to block the enemy on Phou Kout Mountain and Phou Song Mountain, while withdrawing from the intermediate zone between the two mountains, forming a large pocket to let the enemy in. On the other hand, on the 11th, they concentrated their superior forces, bypassed the enemy, and rapidly penetrated the enemy's rear, cutting off the enemy's retreat and dividing and encircling the enemy's battalion headquarters. As soon as the battle started, fierce firepower suddenly bloomed in the enemy's heart, immediately wiping out a company of the enemy, and the entire attacking enemy immediately retreated from the entire front.
　　In the recent battles to counter the enemy's dry-season offensive, the heroes of Phou Kout either circled around to the enemy's rear to raid the enemy, or ambushed the enemy unexpectedly, making the enemy panic. On November 12, 1965, a large number of enemies launched an attack on Phou Kout Mountain. Ten warriors of the patriotic forces quietly sneaked into an enemy stronghold in the middle of the night, eliminated the enemy's sentry with a hand grenade, and annihilated an entire platoon of the enemy before the enemy could fight back. By the time the enemy elsewhere discovered it, this divine force had all safely returned to its defenses.
　　Coordinating with the enemy's ground invasion, from January 1965 to the present, American aerial bandits have almost never interrupted their bombing or harassment of this steel position for a single day. But the more they come, the more they are eliminated. From November 11, 1965 alone, that is, from the day the American aerial bandits launched a large-scale bombing of Phou Kout Mountain, to the end of December, 48 enemy planes had been shot down and 49 had been damaged in the Phou Kout Mountain area.
　　The enemy's ground invasion failed, and the American aerial bandits' aerial invasion also failed. The heroic soldiers guarding Phou Kout Mountain proudly said: "The enemy can't even think of gnawing at Phou Kout Mountain with bombs and shells alone! Battles have to be fought by people, but the enemy is ambitious but timid, with strong artillery fire but weak troops. The reason why Phou Kout is as strong as steel is because there are steel troops guarding it!"

### 富科特山是敌人的坟墓

    富科特山是敌人的坟墓
    战斗在富科特山前线的老挝两支爱国部队的钢铁战士们有一句口号：“把我们的阵地变成埋葬敌人的坟墓！”现在，在这个英雄阵地上确已埋葬了从空中和地面来犯的许多侵略者。
    美国侵略者一直把富科特山视作它进犯川圹解放区的障碍和眼中钉。它在一九六五年里从元旦开始直到年终，曾一次又一次地向这里进犯。但是，富科特山前线的英雄部队在反击敌人进攻的战斗中，打得英勇顽强，战术机动灵活，创造了许多歼灭敌人有生力量的光辉战绩，把富科特山变成了埋葬进犯的敌人的坟墓。仅从一九六五年十一月十一日到三十日的二十天战斗中，在富科特山前线敌人就留下了一百五十多具尸体，更多的敌人被打伤。
    富科特山前线英雄部队充分发挥他们英勇机智的特点，在防御中善于打近战歼灭敌人，击退了敌人的进攻。去年十一月中旬的一次战斗中，两个连的敌人在猛烈的炮火掩护下，窜到离解放军某部前沿工事只有几米的地方，沉着的战士们才突然用手榴弹发起反冲锋，一下打死打伤敌人二十六名，并击溃了来犯的全部敌军。
    富科特山前线的英雄们用机动灵活的战术歼灭敌人的事例是很多的。一九六五年初，美伪集团从元旦开始以大批飞机大炮向富科特山连续地进行疯狂的轰击。一月七日，敌人以六个营的兵力，分三路向富科特山发动进攻。一路在正面强攻，另外两路从侧面形成包围圈，企图攻占富科特山前线部队指挥部。这时，富科特山前线指挥部一方面留一部分兵力在富科特山和富松山阻击敌人，同时撤出这两山之间的中间地带，形成一个大口袋，把敌人放进来。另一方面他们则于十一日集中优势兵力，绕过敌人，神速地穿插到敌人后方，切断了敌人的后路，并分割和包围了敌人一个营的指挥所。战斗一打响，猛烈的火力便突然在敌人心脏里开花，立即全歼一个连的敌人，而整个进攻的敌人也就立刻从全线败退下去。
    在最近反击敌人旱季进攻的战斗中，富科特英雄们或是迂回到敌人后方去奇袭敌人；或是出其不意地伏击敌人；打得敌人惶惶不安。一九六五年十一月十二日，大批敌人向富科特山发动进攻，爱国部队的十位勇士在深夜悄悄地摸到敌人一个据点，用一个手榴弹消灭了敌人的岗哨后，没等敌人还手，就全部歼灭了敌人一个排。等到别处敌人发觉时，这支神兵已经全部安全返防。
    配合敌人从地面的进犯，从一九六五年一月起到现在，美国飞贼几乎一天也未间断过对这个钢铁阵地的轰炸或侵扰。但是它们来得越多，被消灭的也就越多。仅从一九六五年十一月十一日，即从美国飞贼对富科特山进行大规模轰炸的那一天算起，到十二月底，富科特山一带已打落敌机四十八架，打伤四十九架。
    敌人的地面进犯失败了，美国飞贼从空中进犯也遭到了失败。守卫富科特山的英雄战士们自豪地说：“敌人光凭炸弹和炮弹是休想啃得动富科特山的！仗是要靠人来打的，但是敌人野心大而胆量小，炮火强而部队弱。富科特所以坚如钢铁，是因为有钢铁的部队守卫在这里！”
