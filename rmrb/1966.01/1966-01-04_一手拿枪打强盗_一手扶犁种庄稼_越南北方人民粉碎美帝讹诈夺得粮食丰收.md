    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi) Correspondent's report: Northern Vietnam reaped a bumper grain harvest in 1965, with total output increasing by 3.9% compared to 1964. This is a significant achievement of the heroic Vietnamese people on the agricultural front in the anti-American and national salvation struggle, with a spirit of decisive battle and sure victory.

    The people of Northern Vietnam held guns in one hand and plows in the other, bravely fighting American aerial bandits while persevering in production with a fighting spirit, achieving good harvests of early rice and late rice. According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments in Vietnam, the average annual yield per hectare in seven counties in the entire north exceeded five tons in 1965. In Hai Duong province, hundreds of agricultural cooperatives, and in the suburbs of Hanoi, more than seventy agricultural cooperatives, exceeded the level of five tons per hectare per year. Other grain crops in various places also had good harvests. In Hung Yen and Ha Tay provinces, one hundred agricultural cooperatives achieved corn yields of 2.5 to 3 tons per hectare.

    The Vinh Linh special zone, located near the 17th parallel, is one of the areas most frequently bombed by enemy aircraft. However, the military and civilians in this area, under the slogan "Fight well, produce well," overcame all difficulties, persisted in rushing to cultivate, plant, and harvest, and strived for a bumper harvest in agricultural production. The average yield per hectare of rice in this area for the whole year exceeded the planned target by 16.5%; the total output exceeded the planned target by 7.5%, an increase of 12.1% compared to 1963, a historically bumper year. In the fiercely contested provinces of Nghe An and Thanh Hoa, the late rice harvest was also the best since 1960.

    American bandit aircraft frantically bombed many water conservancy facilities in Northern Vietnam, attempting to sabotage agricultural production. However, the military and civilians in various places heroically defended the water conservancy projects and promptly carried out repairs. After enemy aircraft bombed the water conservancy system in Quynh Luu county, the members of the local agricultural cooperatives worked day and night to rush to build dams and pump water for irrigation, seizing a good grain harvest. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various places vigorously built small-scale water conservancy projects. The seven provinces in the midstream area of the Red River in the northern plains have all overfulfilled the 1965 water conservancy construction plan, playing a significant role in ensuring a bumper agricultural harvest.

    After achieving a bumper grain harvest in 1965, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Northern Vietnam enthusiastically sold grain to the state, vigorously supporting the front lines and supporting the victorious struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

They are determined to shoot down more American planes and increase grain production. Thanks to the efforts of the broad masses of the people, many places reaped bumper harvests last year.

    一手拿枪打强盗　一手扶犁种庄稼
    越南北方人民粉碎美帝讹诈夺得粮食丰收
    据新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南北方一九六五年粮食丰收，总产量比一九六四年增加百分之三点九。这是英雄的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中，以决战决胜精神在农业战线上取得的重大成绩。
    越南北方人民一手拿枪，一手扶犁，在英勇地打击美国空中强盗的同时，以战斗精神坚持生产，取得了早稻和晚稻的好收成。据越南有关部门不完全统计，全北方一九六五年有七个县的平均每公顷年产量超过五吨。海阳省有成百个农业社、河内市郊有七十多个农业社超过了每公顷年产五吨的水平。各地其他粮食作物收成也很好。兴安、河西两省有一百个农业社的玉米每公顷产量达到二点五吨到三吨。
    处在十七度线附近的永灵特区，是遭受敌机轰炸最多的地区之一，但是这个地区的军民在“打得好、生产好”的口号下，克服一切困难，坚持抢耕、抢种、抢收，争取了农业生产的大丰收。这个地区全年水稻每公顷平均产量超过计划指标百分之十六点五；总产量超过计划指标百分之七点五，比历史上大丰收的一九六三年还增产百分之十二点一。战斗激烈的义安、清化等省，晚稻的收成也是一九六○年以来最好的。
    美国强盗飞机曾猖狂轰炸越南北方的多处水利设施，企图破坏农业生产。但是，各地军民一面英勇地保卫了水利工程，一面及时进行了抢修。在敌机轰炸了琼琉县的水利系统后，当地农业社的社员们就日夜突击，抢筑堤坝，戽水灌溉，夺取了粮食的好收成。与此同时，各地农业社还大力兴建小型水利工程。北部平原红河中游地区的七个省，都已超额完成一九六五年的水利建设计划，对保证农业丰收起了很大作用。
