    Cannot Be Separated from the People for Even a Moment
    In the past, why couldn't we see? What was covering our eyes, making us forget the masses? In the past, why couldn't we grasp things? It was fear that revolutionary transformation would "revolutionize" our own heads.
    In the past, due to the lackluster spirit of our county committee leadership, the bureaucratic work style of the departments directly under the county was also quite serious. For example, for a period of time, the tractor station, substation, supply and marketing cooperative, and hospital in our county did not serve the masses well, and the peasants were very dissatisfied, calling them the "Four Disgusts" of the county (meaning annoying). After the Socialist Education Movement, the vast majority of cadres in the departments directly under the county established the three viewpoints of serving politics, serving production, and serving the masses, universally went to the grassroots to conduct on-the-spot investigations, and a department took the initiative to take charge of one aspect or one area of work, further understanding the situation and needs of agricultural production, and established a deep class feeling with the peasant masses, eliminated many cumbersome procedures, greatly facilitating production and the masses. For example, the industrial departments changed their purely emphasizing the "business principles" of "production, sales, and profits," went deep into the countryside to investigate, and trial-produced a large number of new products suitable for rural areas. The health departments started with production, focused on environmental sanitation, and promoted fertilizer accumulation, which was also beneficial to the physical and mental health of the peasants. The tractor station overcame the "official" work style, signed contracts in the fields, improved the quality of cultivated land, and went from losing money every year in the past to now having a surplus. The food company changed from buying pigs and selling meat to "inspecting quality at the pigsty" and fixed-point purchases, which greatly facilitated the masses and also expanded the purchase volume. Now, the tractor station, substation, supply and marketing cooperative, and hospital have changed in the eyes of the masses, and the masses have changed from calling them the "Four Disgusts" to calling them the "Four Confidants." (Editor's note: The transformation of these four units in this county from the masses' "disgust" to the masses' "confidants" is a gratifying change. There are probably some departments or units in various places whose work is not done well and are the masses' "disgust." Are they one or several? How to change them?)
    Where did these revolutionary actions come from? The masses said: "Whether it is good or not depends on the leadership." This is completely correct. Only when the county committee leadership takes the lead in revolutionary transformation can it drive the revolutionary transformation of various departments. In the past few years, the county committee also constantly issued instructions and made demands, calling on various departments to carry out revolutionary transformation. Sometimes they criticized them for their slow actions in supporting agriculture, but they could not solve the problem ideologically. There are many reasons, the most important one being that there was a problem with the mental state of the county committee. Therefore, the county committee could not see some of the problems existing in the work of various departments. For example, some products produced by the industrial departments did not meet the needs of the masses, but we did not go deep down, did not follow the mass line, so we never knew; the medical departments in the past did not do enough to serve the peasants, but they had a good service attitude towards some leading comrades of the county committee. In this way, the county committee naturally saw less of the suffering of the masses, and could not promptly discover the problems in the work of the medical departments. Some things the county committee saw but could not grasp. For example, the tractor station did not pay attention to the quality of machine耕, the electricians of the power supply bureau were special in their work and life in the countryside, and so on. Why couldn't these problems be grasped when they were reported? Because the leading cadres of the county committee were afraid of hardship and did not go down to squat, so they did not dare to propose revolutionary transformation measures, fearing that the revolution would be directed at their own heads, and even if they put forward some requirements, they were low standards. As a result, the upper levels followed suit, and invisibly fostered the "laziness" of some department leading cadres.
    Last year, the leading cadres of the county committee took the lead in the revolution, and all nine members of the county committee standing committee went to the teams with the most problems to settle down, and the production offices of the county committee and the county people's committee also moved to the countryside. The leading cadres of various departments also raced to take their "gang of people" down to squat, take charge of areas, and run the full course. In this way, not only could the county committee put forward more practical requirements for various departments, but various departments could also find important ways to carry out their work.

    一刻也不能脱离人民
    过去，为什么看不见？是什么蒙着自己的眼，忘了群众过去，为什么抓不起？是害怕革命化“革”到自己的头上来
    过去，由于我们县委领导的精神状态不振，县直属各部门的机关化作风也比较严重。例如我县拖拉机站、变电站、供销社、卫生院有一段时期为群众服务不好，农民很不满意，说它们是县里的“四大腻味”（讨厌的意思）。社会主义教育运动后，县直属各部门绝大部分干部树立了为政治、为生产、为群众服务的三大观点，普遍到基层蹲点调查，一个部门主动地包了一个方面或一个地区的工作，进一步了解了农业生产的状况和需要，同农民群众建立了深厚的阶级感情，去掉了许多烦琐的手续，大大便利了生产，便利了群众。如工业部门改变了单纯强调“产、销、赚”的“生意经”，深入农村调查，试制了大批农村适用的新产品。卫生部门从生产入手，大抓环境卫生，推进了积肥工作，也有利于农民身心健康。拖拉机站克服了“官”字号作风，地头订合同，提高了耕地质量，以往年年赔钱，现在有了盈余。食品公司由收猪、卖肉，改为“登圈验质”，定点收购，大大便利了群众，也扩大了收购量。现在，拖拉机站、变电站、供销社、卫生院在群众心目中变样了，群众已由叫它们“四大腻味”，改称“四大知心”了。（编者按：这个县四个单位由群众的“腻味”变成群众的“知心”，是个可喜的转变。各地恐怕都有一些部门或单位的工作搞得不好，是群众的“腻味”。它们是一个还是几个？怎么来改变它们？）
    这些革命行动是怎么来的呢？群众说：“好不好，在领导。”这是完全正确的。只有县委领导首先带头革命化，才能带动各部门革命化。过去几年，县委也不断发指示、提要求，号召各部门搞革命化。有时批评他们支援农业行动迟缓，但不能从思想上解决问题。原因有多方面，最主要一条是县委的精神状态有问题。所以，对各部门工作当中存在的问题，有的是县委看不见。如工业部门生产的一些产品不符合群众要求，但我们没有深入下去，没有走群众路线，所以一直不知道；医务部门过去为农民服务做得不够，可是他们对县委一些领导同志服务态度好。这样县委对于群众疾苦自然看得就少了，对于医务部门工作中的问题也就及时发现不了。有的是县委看到了也抓不起。例如拖拉机站不抓机耕的质量，供电局的电工在农村工作生活特殊化，等等。这些问题反映上来了为什么抓不起？因为县委领导干部害怕艰苦，不下去蹲点，所以就不敢提革命化措施，怕革到自己的头上来，即便提出一些要求也是低标准的。结果上行下效，无形中就助长了一些部门领导干部的“懒风”。
    去年，县委领导干部带头革命，九名县委常委全到问题最多的队去落户，县委和县人委生产办公室也搬到了农村。各部门的领导干部也都争先恐后带着自己的“一帮人马”下去蹲点、包片、跑面。这样不但县委能对各部门提出比较切合实际的要求，各部门也能找到开展业务的重要门径。
