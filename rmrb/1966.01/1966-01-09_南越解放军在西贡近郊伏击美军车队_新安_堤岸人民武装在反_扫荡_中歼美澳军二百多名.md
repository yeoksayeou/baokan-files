    Saigon News: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces ambushed an American military convoy on a highway eight kilometers east of Saigon on the morning of the 8th, inflicting casualties and losses on the enemy.
    According to Western news agencies, the attack occurred on a highway leading to Bien Hoa, not far from the other side of the Saigon River. The first vehicle in the convoy hit a landmine planted by the Liberation Armed Forces, killing two enemies on the spot. Then, the Liberation Armed Forces fired fiercely at the convoy from both sides of the highway, throwing the enemy into chaos. When two hundred South Vietnamese puppet soldiers, who were conducting military exercises nearby, rushed to the rescue, the Liberation Army had already safely withdrawn from the ambush site.
    The Associated Press said, "The Viet Cong has a considerable force around Saigon." This attack was the Liberation Army's "first clash with American troops so close to Saigon."
    Hanoi, January 8th (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio, the Liberation Armed Forces of the Xin An-Di An region in South Vietnam annihilated a total of 350 enemy soldiers, including over 200 American aggressor troops and Australian accomplice troops, in the counter-"sweep" operations carried out during the first three days of January this year. In addition, the Liberation Armed Forces shot down five enemy aircraft.
    The American aggressor troops of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the Australian accomplice troops, and nine battalions of South Vietnamese puppet paratroopers, under the cover of many aircraft and artillery, launched a large-scale "sweep" of the De He region west of Saigon on December 31st of last year. However, the Liberation Armed Forces employed mobile and flexible tactics, causing the enemy to repeatedly miss their targets, run around aimlessly, and continuously carry out surprise attacks, killing and wounding the enemy. Near Bao Zhai, they inflicted a sudden and heavy blow on an aggressor force, driving the aggressors into waist-deep swamps, where they were battered and suffered heavy casualties.

    南越解放军在西贡近郊伏击美军车队
    新安——堤岸人民武装在反“扫荡”中歼美澳军二百多名
    新华社八日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量八日上午在西贡东郊八公里的一条公路上伏击了一支美军车队，使敌人遭到了伤亡和损失。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次袭击发生在西贡河彼岸不远的通往边和的一条公路上。车队的第一辆车首先碰上解放武装力量所埋设的地雷，当场有两名敌人被炸死。接着，解放武装力量从公路两旁向车队猛烈射击，敌人乱作一团。当在附近进行军事演习的二百名南越伪军急忙赶来救援时，解放军已经安全撤离伏击地点。
    美联社说，“越共在西贡周围的力量相当大。”这次袭击是解放军“第一次在离西贡这么近的地方同美军发生冲突。”
    新华社河内八日电　据越南南方解放电台报道，越南南方新安—堤岸地区解放武装力量在今年一月份头三天进行的反“扫荡”战斗中，共歼灭敌军三百五十名，其中包括美国侵略军和澳大利亚帮凶军二百多名。另外，解放武装力量还击落敌机五架。
    美国侵略军第一七三空降旅、澳大利亚帮凶军以及九个营的南越伪军伞兵，去年十二月三十一日在许多飞机大炮的掩护下，分兵几路对西贡以西的德和地区进行大规模的“扫荡”。但是，解放武装力量发挥机动灵活的战术，使敌人接连扑空，到处瞎跑，并且不断进行奇袭，杀伤敌人。他们在保寨附近给予了一支侵略军以突然沉重的打击，在泥深及腰的沼泽地里，把侵略军打得狼狈不堪，伤亡惨重。
