    “Why Can’t Farmers Engage in Science?”
    —A Record of the Perseverance of the Liming Brigade in Longhai County, Fujian Province, in Scientific Experimentation and Scientific Farming
    Can farmers engage in scientific experimentation, can they "farm scientifically"? The Liming Brigade gave a resounding answer. Since the period of agricultural cooperation, they have persisted in scientific experimentation and gradually mastered a set of methods for "scientific farming."
    The reason why the cadres and members of the Liming Brigade are able to "farm scientifically" is because they have established the idea of farming for the revolution. With this revolutionary spirit, they will achieve greater victories in the struggle to seize high yields.
    The Liming Brigade of Lianhua Commune in Longhai County, Fujian Province, presents a delightful scene: the autumn harvest and winter planting have ended, the village granaries are full, and the wheat fields are a lush green. The people of Liming have just put down their harvesting sickles and are now plowing the fields, engaging in winter cultivation, winter water conservancy projects, and winter manure accumulation, striving for another bumper harvest this year.
    The Liming Brigade is located on the banks of the Jiulong River and is a well-known high-yield rice-producing area. However, before liberation, the natural conditions here were not good. The fields were 40% "hydrochloric acid soil," 20% "dog dung mounds," 30% "hardpan soil," and 10% "middle-peasant fields." Double-cropping rice yielded only five or six hundred jin per mu each year, and disasters occurred during droughts and floods, reducing production. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and on the road to collectivization, the people of Liming, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, built sluice gates, dug long canals, constructed reservoirs, and built pumping stations, forming a complete water conservancy system that draws water, stores water, and irrigates water, making the more than 3,000 mu of farmland in the entire brigade immune to drought and flood. The people of Liming also continuously conducted scientific experiments and promoted advanced technologies. Since 1963, the yield of rice per mu has exceeded 1,600 jin for three consecutive years.
    The rapid development of agricultural production has strengthened the collective economy, increased the income of the members, and the contribution of the people of Liming to the country has also increased. In the twelve years since cooperation, the entire brigade of more than 690 households, with an average of less than one mu of land per person, has provided the state with more than 30 million jin of marketable grain.
    While achieving great success in rice production, the people of Liming have also created a complete set of advanced cultivation techniques for stable and high-yield rice production. This set of technical experience is becoming a common asset in various parts of Fujian and some other regions.

          Scientific Farming　Clear Mind and Sharp Eyes
    Since the period of agricultural cooperation, the Liming Brigade has adhered to scientific experimentation and cultivated the land with a scientific attitude. They have experienced one sharp struggle after another on this road. As soon as the slogan of scientific farming was put forward, some people said: "Labor is our duty, and doing science is the business of scientists." Huang Haicheng and Pan Wumao, brigade cadres from poor peasant backgrounds, enlightened everyone: "In the old society, we poor peasants worked like animals and still couldn't get enough to eat, so of course we couldn't talk about doing science. Now it's different. Poor and lower-middle peasants have become the masters of the land, and we have the leadership of the Party and the government. Why can't farmers engage in science?" Some people also said: "'Lu Caihao' fine seeds were selected and bred by old poor peasant Lu Cai in his labor and have been promoted in several provinces. This is an example of farmers doing science." As a result, some people who originally thought that science was mysterious became clear-minded and sharp-eyed. More people participated in scientific experiments. But the struggle was not over. As soon as the short-stalked rice varieties were introduced to Liming, a struggle between old and new ideas began. Some people saw the short-stalked rice grown in the small experimental plots and were disappointed, saying: "Pigs grow tall to grow more meat, and rice grows tall to produce more grain. This kind of rice has no great prospects." After hearing this, Huang Haicheng did not criticize these people for being "backward" nor did he forcibly promote the short-stalked rice varieties. He first continued to persist in the trial planting with some activists. At harvest time, the yield per mu was more than 800 jin, more than 20% higher than that of the tall-stalked rice. At this time, some people said: "You can't judge a book by its cover, the rice stalks are short, but the yield is not low." However, some people still believed: "The small experimental plots are well-managed and can produce high yields, but large-scale planting may not be able to produce high yields." The following year, the short-stalked rice varieties were expanded to more than 100 mu, and the yield per mu generally reached 800 or 900 jin. During the harvesting, each production team sent people to participate in the acceptance and summarize experiences. In this way, most people praised it, but representatives of several production teams with more sandy soil still had concerns. The brigade then conducted a third experiment in the sandy soil. As a result, the yield per mu was about 20% higher than that of the tall-stalked rice. Thus, a new situation emerged in the entire brigade where everyone loved short-stalked rice and every team was vying to plant short-stalked rice.

          Contrast Experiments　Ideological Harvest
    When promoting the advanced technique of rational close planting, people inside and outside the village were talking about the benefits of rational close planting, but the old farmers Huang Dinglan and Huang Panchi were still reluctant to abandon the old rules. Huang Haicheng thought that Huang Dinglan's opinion showed that there were still a few people who had concerns about promoting the technology of rational close planting. If people's minds are not open, even the best technical experience will be useless. Therefore, near his close-planting experimental field, he delineated two mu of land for Huang Dinglan and others to conduct sparse-planting experiments.
    When Huang Dinglan and Huang Panchi heard that they were allowed to plant contrast experimental fields, they happily said, "We have been planting fields from black hair to white hair, we can't be wrong." Under their careful management, the sparsely planted rice fields grew well. The two old farmers smiled on their faces and were happy in their hearts. Who knew that at harvest time, after weighing the harvest, the average yield per mu was 51 jin lower than that of the closely planted experimental field. The old man was very surprised, why was the yield so much less when water, fertilizer, seeds, and management were all the same? What was the "difference"? Huang Haicheng led them to the field to carefully count the rice heads and found that the number of clumps per mu in sparse planting was more than 30% less than in close planting. Huang Dinglan and others suddenly realized and said: It turned out that this was the "difference." In this way, although the yield of sparsely planted fields was several tens of jin less, it was a great harvest in people's minds.
    In this way, every time the people of Liming went through a scientific experiment, every time they went through an ideological struggle, production moved forward one step, and understanding also improved one step. Over the years, the people of Liming have worked hard in every link of rice production and gradually summed up a set of rice cultivation management techniques such as scientific seedling raising, scientific baking of fields, rational irrigation, and rational fertilization.

            Talent Emerges　Experience Transmitted Overseas
    Now, the activists in scientific farming in the Liming Brigade have developed from more than 30 in the early stage to more than 110. Each production team has four or five "all-rounders" with solid rice planting techniques. Huang Haicheng and Pan Wumao have grown into new types of rice experts who are both production experts and understand scientific principles, and have been hired by the Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences as special researchers. In recent years, the Liming Brigade has sent 40 or 50 farmer technicians every year to rice-producing areas inside and outside the province to impart high-yield rice experience. In June 1965, Huang Haicheng was invited by the Republic of Mali to go to the African continent to spread high-yield rice technology. When the news came, cheers rang out inside and outside the village. The people of Liming had a vivid lesson: not only should we serve the Chinese people, but also the people of the world. The people of Liming are seizing high yields for the revolution and taking faster steps in scientific farming.
    At the end of June, after everyone enthusiastically bid farewell to Huang Haicheng when he went abroad, a heat wave of doing science for the national socialist revolution and creating high yields for the world revolution immediately appeared in the team. Pan Wumao, who had just taken over Huang Haicheng as the secretary of the brigade party general branch, led everyone to invest in the experiment of cultivating new varieties of high-yield rice and the experiment of expanding winter planting to change two crops a year to three crops. Pan Wumao said: "In the past, although we had some experience and a group of technical experts emerged, we are still far from meeting the requirements of planting fields for the Chinese revolution and for the world revolution. In the future, we must catch up."

    “农民怎么不能搞科学？”
    ——记福建龙海县黎明大队坚持科学实验、科学种田
    农民能不能搞科学实验，会不会“科学种田”？黎明大队作了响亮的回答。他们从合作化时期起就坚持科学实验，逐步掌握了一套“科学种田”的方法。
    黎明大队的干部、社员所以能够“科学种田”，是因为他们树立了为革命种田的思想。有了这种革命精神，在夺高产的斗争中，就会取得更大的胜利。
    福建省龙海县莲花公社黎明大队呈现着一派喜人的景象：秋收冬种已经结束，村里金谷满仓，田野上麦田一片嫩绿。黎明人刚刚放下秋收的禾镰，就?牛挥锄下田，投入冬耕翻土、冬修水利和冬季积肥的活动，力争今年再夺高产。
    黎明大队地处九龙江畔，是著名的水稻高产区。但是，解放前，这里的自然条件并不好。田是四分“盐酸地”，二分“狗屎埔”，三分“硬土板”，一分“中农田”。双季稻每年亩产只有五六百斤，一遇旱涝就成灾减产。解放后，黎明人在党的领导下，在集体化的道路上，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，修筑水闸，开挖长渠，建设水库，兴建抽水机站，形成一个牵“龙”引水，锁“龙”蓄水、铁“龙”灌水的完整水利系统，使全大队三千多亩农田旱涝保收。黎明人还不断进行科学实验，推广先进技术，从一九六三年起，连续三年水稻亩产一千六百斤以上。
    农业生产的迅速发展，壮大了集体经济，增加了社员的收入，黎明人对国家的贡献也越来越大。合作化以来的十二年中，全大队六百九十多户，在平均每人不到一亩田的条件下，给国家提供商品粮三千多万斤。
    黎明人在取得水稻高产的巨大成就的同时，也创造了一整套水稻稳产高产的先进栽培技术。这套技术经验，正在成为福建各地和其它一些地区的共同财富。
          科学种田　心明眼亮
    黎明大队从合作化时期起，就坚持科学实验，用科学态度种田。他们在这条道路上经历过一场又一场的尖锐斗争。科学种田的口号一提出，有的人说：“劳动是我们的本分，搞科学是科学家的事。”贫农出身的大队干部黄海澄、潘无毛等人听了就启发大家说：“在旧社会，我们贫苦农民做牛做马还吃不上饭，当然谈不上搞科学。现在不同了。贫农下中农成为土地的主人，又有党和政府的领导，农民怎么不能搞科学？”有的人也说：“‘陆财号’良种就是老贫农陆财在劳动中选育出来的，已在好几个省推广。这就是农民搞科学的例子。”于是，原来一些以为科学神秘的人，心明眼亮了。参加科学实验的人多起来了。但是斗争并没有结束。矮秆水稻良种刚引进黎明，一场新旧思想的斗争就开始了。有的人看见小丘试种的矮秆稻，矮得出奇，就败兴地说：“猪高多长肉，禾高多打粮。这种稻子没大出息。”黄海澄听后，没有批评这些人“落后”，也没有硬性推广矮稻良种。他先同一些积极分子继续坚持试种。收成时，亩产都在八百斤以上，超过高秆稻二成多。这时，有些人说：“人不可貌相，稻秆矮产量倒不低。”但仍然有人认为：“小丘试种功夫好，能高产，大面积种就不一定能高产。”第二年，矮秆良种水稻扩大到一百多亩，亩产普遍达到八九百斤。收打时，各个生产队都派人参加验收和总结经验。这样，大多数人叫好，但是沙质田较多的几个生产队的代表还有顾虑。大队又在沙质田里进行第三次试验。结果，亩产量比高秆稻高二成左右。这样，全大队便出现人人喜爱矮秆稻、队队争种矮秆稻的新局面。
          对比试验　思想丰收
    在推广合理密植的先进技术时，村里村外都在谈合理密植的好处，可是老农黄丁兰和黄畔池还舍不得甩掉老规矩。黄海澄想，黄丁兰有意见，说明还有少数人对推广合理密植的技术有顾虑。要是人的思想不通，再好的技术经验也无用。于是，在他的密植试验田附近，划出二亩田给黄丁兰等进行稀植试验。
    黄丁兰和黄畔池听说让他们种对比试验田，高兴地说：“我们种田从黑发种到白发，错不了。”稀植稻田在他们精心管理下，长势喜人。两位老农笑在眉头，乐在心头。谁知收割时，一过秤，平均亩产比密植的试验田低五十一斤。老人很奇怪，水、肥、种、管样样不差，为什么产量却少了这么多？究竟“差”在那里？黄海澄领他们到田里细心地数稻头，发现稀植的比密植的一亩地丛数少三成多。黄丁兰等恍然大悟地说：原来就“差”在这里。这样，稀植田产量虽然少收几十斤，可是在人们的思想上却是一次大丰收。
    就这样，黎明人每经过一次科学实验，每经过一场思想斗争，生产就前进了一步，认识也提高了一步。这些年来，黎明人在水稻生产的各个环节上下硬功夫，逐步总结出一套科学育秧、科学烤田、合理灌水、合理施肥等水稻栽培管理技术。
            人才辈出　远洋传经
    现在，黎明大队科学种田的积极分子，已从初期的三十多人发展到一百一十多人。每个生产队都有四五个种田技术过硬的“全把手”。黄海澄、潘无毛已经成长为既是生产能手，又懂科学道理的新型水稻专家，被福建省农业科学院聘请为特约研究员。近年来，黎明大队每年都派出四五十名农民技术员，到省内外的水稻产区传授水稻高产经验。一九六五年六月，黄海澄应马里共和国的聘请，要到非洲大陆传播水稻高产技术。消息传来，村里村外一片欢呼声。黎明人上了生动的一课：不但要为中国人民服务，还要为世界人民服务。黎明人为革命夺高产，用科学种田的步伐迈得更快了。
    六月底，大家热烈欢送黄海澄出国后，队里立即出现一个为全国社会主义革命搞科学，为世界人民革命创高产的热潮。刚接替黄海澄担任大队党总支书记的潘无毛，带领大家投入了培育水稻高产新品种的试验和变一年二熟为三熟的扩大冬种的试验。潘无毛说：“过去，我们虽然有一些经验，出现一批技术能手，但距离为中国革命种田、为世界革命种田的要求，还差得远，今后一定要迎头赶上。”
