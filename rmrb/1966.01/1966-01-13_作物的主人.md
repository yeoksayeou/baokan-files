    The steel pipe output of the Yongxin Factory has increased, urgently requiring the addition of a furnace for annealing and drying the steel pipes. However, the factory's small area is crammed with factory buildings, canteens, and offices, leaving no space at all. What to do? The comrades at the Yongxin Factory believe that the area of the site is fixed and cannot be changed, but people are flexible. The young furnace mason, Tao Zhiying, with the help of his comrades, transformed an old furnace into a new type of double-layered furnace for both annealing and drying steel pipes. This eliminated the need for any additional space and saved the state more than 10,000 yuan in furnace masonry costs.

    Things are inanimate, but people are animate. The animate should not be constrained by the inanimate, but should control the inanimate. Only in this way can people become the masters of things, and not be slaves to things. Whether or not it is possible to add a furnace for annealing and drying without additional space depends on whether people can be the masters of things. The fact that the comrades at Yongxin were able to do this shows that they truly deserve to be called the masters of our era.

    作物的主人
    永鑫厂钢管产量增长了，急需增加一只钢管退火和烘干用的炉子。但全厂狭小的场地上，挤满了厂房、食堂和办公室，没有一点空地方。怎么办呢？永鑫厂的同志认为，场地面积是死的，是无法改变的，但人是活的。青年砌炉工陶志英，在同志们的帮助下，把原来一只旧炉子改造成新型的、双层式的钢管退火烘干两用炉。这样，既不要什么场地，还为国家省下一万多元砌炉费。
    物是死的，人是活的，活的就不应该受制于死的，而应该驾驭死的。这样人才能变成物的主人，不至于做物的奴隶。没有场地，能不能增加退火和烘干用的炉子，关键就看人能不能做物的主人。永鑫的同志能这样做，说明他们真正称得上是我们时代的主人。
