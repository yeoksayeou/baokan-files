    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th, Geneva dispatch: Soviet and American representatives at the Seventeen-Nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva on the 27th vigorously advocated reaching an agreement on the so-called "non-proliferation" issue, attempting to maintain the nuclear hegemony of the US and the Soviet Union through such an agreement and more conveniently pursue their nuclear blackmail policy.
    This conference resumed according to resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly at the end of last year. These resolutions requested the US and the Soviet Union, as well as other members of the United Nations Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, to continue negotiations to conclude a "non-proliferation" treaty and reach agreements on other "disarmament" issues. The US and the Soviet Union both voted in favor of these resolutions during the voting at the UN General Assembly.
    Before the start of this conference, US representative Foster and Soviet representative Charapekin held a 45-minute meeting on procedural issues for the conference. An American spokesman announced after the meeting that Foster and Charapekin had "completely resolved every issue they needed to discuss." At the January 27th meeting, Foster read a letter from US President Johnson. In the letter, Johnson demanded that "we must intensify our work in Geneva." He also linked the so-called "non-proliferation" issue to the Vietnam issue, saying that the "differences" among the participating member states on the Vietnam issue "give us even more important reasons to seek our common interests in preventing nuclear proliferation and stopping the arms race."
    In his letter, Johnson put forward a "seven-point plan" for the conference to consider. The first point of this plan was to "seek to conclude a non-proliferation treaty." Johnson said, "We are prepared to sign such a treaty, making it applicable to both nuclear and non-nuclear nations. We are prepared to work with other countries to ensure that non-nuclear nations never acquire their own nuclear weapons, obtain national control over nuclear weapons, acquire the ability to launch nuclear weapons themselves, or receive assistance in the manufacture or testing of nuclear weapons."
    The other points of the plan stipulated "when transferring nuclear materials or equipment for peaceful purposes to countries without nuclear weapons, to fully accept the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency or the supervision of corresponding international guarantees," that is, to be supervised by international institutions controlled by the United States; to "strive to strengthen the arrangements for the United Nations and other international security," in particular to provide "strong support" from the United States to some non-nuclear countries to deal with the so-called "threat of nuclear blackmail," that is, for the United States to provide a so-called "nuclear umbrella" to bring these countries into the US nuclear strategy system. The plan also called for expanding the Moscow Three-Party Partial Test Ban Treaty, "including underground nuclear tests," and conducting on-site inspections for the implementation of the treaty, and so on.
    Foster also said in a statement to reporters on the 26th that the United States believes that reaching an agreement on "non-proliferation" measures is "the most urgent." He said that he hoped that Johnson's "peace offensive" launched on the Vietnam issue would "have an impact" on the disarmament conference.
    Charapekin also emphasized the importance of concluding a "non-proliferation" treaty in his speech at the meeting, saying that "the important interests of the people of all countries require" the conclusion of this treaty as soon as possible. He emphasized that the Soviet Union was willing to conduct point-by-point discussions with the West on the draft "non-proliferation" treaty.
    Charapekin openly said in a conversation with reporters on the 25th, "I don't want to make our discussions dependent on Vietnam (issue)." He said that there is currently a possibility of reaching agreements on some issues for which the time is ripe, and the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" is one of these issues. He said that the conference must first discuss the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" issue, and the Soviet Union is "ready to sign a non-proliferation agreement as soon as possible."
    Charapekin's remarks to reporters were welcomed by the US and British representatives. Foster said, "I welcome this kind of talk. This is consistent with our attitude." British representative Chalfont said that he was "encouraged by Charapekin's remarks that there is a prospect of reaching an agreement. I agree with his view."
    The Associated Press commented on Charapekin's speech, saying that "Charapekin carefully did not make any speeches criticizing any Western governments when he arrived in Geneva," which is "very rare." Charapekin also "carefully did not attack or even criticize the United States on the Vietnam issue," and he "even said that the Soviet Union no longer believes that the United States staying in Vietnam is an obstacle to making progress in the Geneva talks." This American news agency also said that during the four months of the disarmament conference recess, the US and the Soviet Union "seemed to have taken a step closer to each other." Now the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom all believe that there is a need for "a carefully considered and patient bargaining" on the "non-proliferation" treaty.

    十七国裁军会议复会　核交易加紧进行
    美苏代表大力鼓吹达成“防止核扩散”协议
    查拉普金竟公开说不希望谈判受到越南问题的影响
    新华社二十八日讯　日内瓦消息：苏联和美国代表二十七日在日内瓦十七国裁军会议上大力鼓吹就所谓“防止核扩散”问题达成协议，企图通过这种协议来维持美苏两国的核霸权，更方便地推行它们的核讹诈政策。
    这次会议是根据联合国大会去年年底通过的决议复会的。这些决议要求美苏两国以及联合国十八国裁军委员会的其他成员继续进行谈判，以缔结一项“防止核扩散”条约并就其他“裁军”问题达成协议。在联大会议表决这些决议时，美苏两国都投了赞成票。
    在这次会议开会前，美国代表福斯特和苏联代表查拉普金就会议的程序问题举行了四十五分钟的会谈。美国发言人在会谈后宣布，福斯特和查拉普金对“他们需要讨论的每一个问题全都解决”。福斯特在二十七日会议上宣读了美国总统约翰逊的一封信。约翰逊在信里要求“必须加紧进行我们在日内瓦的工作”。他还把所谓“防止核扩散”问题同越南问题联系起来，说什么与会成员国在越南问题上的“分歧”，“使我们有更为重要的理由来谋求我们在防止核扩散和制止军备竞赛方面的共同利益”。
    约翰逊在信中提出了一个要会议考虑的“七点计划”。这个计划的第一点就是要“设法缔结一项不扩散的条约”。约翰逊说，“我们准备签订这样一项条约，使它既适用于核国家也适用于非核国家。我们准备同其他国家一道使非核国家决不获得自己的核武器、取得对核武器的国家控制、获得自己发射核武器的能力，或是在制造或试验核武器方面得到帮助。”
    计划的其他各点规定“在把用于和平目的的核物资或装备转让给没有核武器的国家的时候，要完全接受国际原子能机构的监督或者是相应的国际保证的监督”，即由美国控制的国际机构来监督；要“努力加强联合国和其他国际安全的安排”，特别是由美国对一些非核国家提供“强有力的支持”来对付所谓“核讹诈的威胁”，即由美国提供所谓“核保护伞”把这些国家纳入美国的核战略体系。计划还要求扩大莫斯科三国部分禁止核试验条约，“把地下核试验包括在内”，并对条约的实施进行就地视察等等。
    福斯特在二十六日对新闻记者发表谈话时还说，美国认为就“防止核扩散”的措施达成协议是“最紧迫”的。他说，他希望约翰逊就越南问题发动的“和平攻势”将对裁军会议“产生影响”。
    查拉普金在会上发言时也大力强调缔结“防止核扩散”条约的重要性，说什么“各国人民的重大利益要求”尽早缔结这个条约。他强调说，苏联愿意就“防止核扩散”条约草案同西方进行逐点的讨论。
    查拉普金二十五日对记者谈话时竟公开说，“我不希望使我们的讨论取决于越南（问题）”。他说，目前存在着就某些解决的时机已经成熟的问题达成协议的可能性，“防止核扩散”问题就是这些问题之一。他说，会议必须首先讨论“防止核扩散”问题，苏联“准备尽快签订一项不扩散的协定”。
    查拉普金对记者的谈话受到美、英代表欢迎。福斯特说，“我欢迎这种谈话。这同我们的态度是一致的”。英国代表查尔方特说，他对查拉普金“所说的存在着达成协议的前景的谈话感到鼓舞。我同意他的看法。”
    美联社在评论查拉普金的讲话时说，“查拉普金在抵达日内瓦的时候，小心地没有发表批评任何西方政府的发言”，这是“十分稀罕的”。查拉普金也“小心地不在越南问题上攻击甚至是批评美国”，他“甚至说，苏联不再认为美国呆在越南是使日内瓦谈判取得进展的障碍。”这家美国通讯社还说，美苏两国在裁军会议休会的四个月中间，“似乎是已向彼此接近了一步”。现在苏、美、英三国代表都认为需要就“防止核扩散”条约“进行一场仔细考虑的耐心的讨价还价”。
