    What should Wang Xiulan, the cotton girl, do when she marries from the fertile Pingfan area to the barren Huangtugang area, in a new living environment, under unfavorable natural conditions? She answered with facts:
    Always Listen to the Party, Be a Seed of Revolution
    Wang Xiulan is a famous cotton girl and national model agricultural worker in Suixian, Hubei. Three years ago, she married from the fertile Pingfan area to the barren Huangtugang area. From her parents' home to her husband's home, it caused great fluctuations in her thinking. However, Wang Xiulan did not disappoint the hopes of the Party and the people. Under the leadership of the Party branch, she closely united the masses. In three years, the cotton yield per mu in her brigade has leaped from a dozen jin to more than a hundred jin.
    Wang Xiulan's family, Wangjiafan in Hejia Commune, has patches of oily sandy soil, which is a good place for growing cotton. However, Xingrong Brigade in Shangshi Commune, her husband's home, is a bare loess ridge with poor soil quality. The cotton yield has always been only ten or twenty jin per mu. How can the yield be increased? When the cadres and commune members saw her off, they said to her: "Huangtugang has great potential, don't be afraid of any difficulties. Man can conquer nature!" Wang Xiulan came to Huangtugang with some doubt.
    When the people on the ridge heard that Xiulan was coming, they welcomed her from the bottom of their hearts. They elected her as the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. Some people said: "Xiulan was a cotton champion in Pingfan. I wonder if she can pass the exam in Huangtugang and be just a cotton scholar?"
    One day, Guo Xianggang, the deputy secretary of the district party committee, came to see her and encouraged her: "Pingfan only accounts for one-third of our district, but the ridge area accounts for two-thirds. If you can find a way to achieve high cotton yields in the ridge area, it will be much more effective."
    Guo Xianggang's words moved Xiulan's heart. She thought, I am a Communist Party member, so I must listen to the Party's words and do whatever the Party tells me to do!
    Xiulan decided to try to set up experimental fields, but she was worried that her family would not support her. Xiulan's husband had joined the army, and there were many people in the family but few laborers. Would there be a conflict between planting experimental fields and busy housework? Xiulan had another layer of worry in her heart.
    Soon, Chang Dongchang, the secretary of the district party committee, also came to Xiulan's home and asked Xiulan: "Have you ever thought about the difference between being a daughter and being a daughter-in-law?" The young Xiulan had not considered this and did not say anything. Chang Dongchang continued: "As a daughter-in-law, you have to learn to be diligent and careful in everything. In this way, when you go to work or help your family to improve, they will be happy." These few words moved Xiulan very much. From then on, she helped with cooking and washing clothes as soon as she got home, and did needlework for her younger siblings. She consulted with the elders at home before doing anything, and carefully explained everything to them after it was done. Her father-in-law said with a smile: "The leaders value you, so go and do things for everyone! The affairs of the family do not depend on you alone." Her mother-in-law also said: "You can go and plant experimental fields with peace of mind, and I will take care of the housework."
    The news that Wang Xiulan was going to do high-yield cotton experiments on Huangtugang spread quickly throughout the brigade. As soon as the 1963 Spring Festival was over, she led the commune members arranged for her by the captain, carrying pond mud, leveling the land, digging ditches, and sowing seeds, all according to the standards of experimental fields, not sloppy at all. When leveling the land, many bricks, tiles, and hemp bone stones were turned out, and Xiulan picked them up one by one, which attracted the attention of many people. After the cotton in Xiulan's experimental field was planted, it was thinned once, with rows and rows of tender and strong plants, attracting many commune members from her own team and the surrounding areas. They discussed it one after another, feeling that it was not easy for such cotton seedlings to grow on Huangtugang. Xiulan's grandmother also moved a chair and sat by the field, helping her granddaughter-in-law chase away chickens and pigs.
    When it came time to pick cotton, Xiulan's cotton field was a sea of ​​silver. The old mothers of the team were all vying to pick cotton in Xiulan's experimental field. They said that they had been picking cotton with their backs bent for a lifetime, and the experimental field planted by girl Xiulan allowed them to pick cotton with their backs straight.
    In this very first year, the first high-yield experimental field planted by Xiulan on Huangtugang achieved an average yield of 142 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    The news of the high yield of cotton on the thin land of the ridge shook the whole brigade and liberated people's minds. Everyone felt that Huangtugang had a great future and asked to set up experimental fields. The enthusiasm of the masses further strengthened Xiulan's confidence.
    In the spring of 1964, Wang Xiulan participated in the provincial agricultural labor model conference. The responsible comrade of the provincial party committee gave a report at the conference, asking everyone to realize a large-scale balanced increase in production through the demonstration role of experimental fields. After returning to the team, Xiulan reported the spirit of the meeting to the Party branch. The Party branch decided that while continuing to focus on high-yield experimental fields, they should also focus on large-scale balanced increases in production. From then on, Xiulan not only carefully managed her own experimental fields, but also organized the cotton girls from various teams into experimental groups, expanded the area of ​​experimental fields, and cultivated more cotton-planting experts. The area of ​​experimental fields accounted for nearly half of the brigade's cotton fields.
    Wang Mingying and Hou Xiufang of the second team both planted experimental fields. The commune held a cotton girls' meeting and sent Hou Xiufang to participate. Wang Mingying thought: Why didn't they send me? She cried over this. Xiulan thought that these performances of the girls were, on the one hand, out of enthusiasm for setting up experimental fields, and on the other hand, reflected their unclear understanding of the purpose of setting up experimental fields. She talked about this idea with the Party branch, and the Party branch secretary and other members believed that if this problem was not solved, the enthusiasm of the masses could not be maintained for long. They asked Xiulan to do more work with the girls.
    One day, Xiulan gathered more than 20 cotton girls from the brigade for a meeting. She asked everyone to think about: Are we running experiments for ourselves or for the revolution? Is it to become famous as a model, or to change the low-yield face of Huangtugang? Then, she organized everyone to study "Serve the People" and Lei Feng's model deeds, and launched a discussion. Wang Mingying said: "I am not satisfied because the leaders did not ask me to attend the meeting. This is wrong, this is for personal gain. Sister Xiulan is right, we are not doing experiments to show off, but to change the face of Huangtugang." Liu Yongying also said: "Lei Feng only thinks about the revolution and not himself, we should not do experimental fields for ourselves, but for the revolution." Through discussion, everyone improved their understanding and clarified that the purpose of setting up experimental fields was to change the face of low production, build a new socialist countryside, and make greater contributions to the people and the country. After this, the girls became more enthusiastic about running experimental fields.
    In three years, very gratifying changes have taken place in Xingrong Brigade. In 1962, the brigade's cotton yield per mu was only a dozen jin, and in 1965, 280 mu of cotton broke the 100-jin ginned cotton mark. However, the biggest change was in the people's mental outlook. This change educated both Xiulan and the masses. People realized that Huangtugang has great potential and great possibilities.

### 永远听党的话，做革命的种子

专栏：

    棉花姑娘汪秀兰从富饶的平畈地区，嫁到贫瘠的黄土岗地区，在新的生活环境中，在不利的自然条件下，应该怎么办？她用事实作了回答：
    永远听党的话，做革命的种子
    汪秀兰是湖北随县著名的棉花姑娘，全国农业劳动模范。三年前，她从富饶的平畈地区嫁到贫瘠的黄土岗地区。从娘家到婆家，在她思想上引起了极大的波动。但是，汪秀兰没有辜负党和人民的希望，在党支部的领导下，她紧密团结群众，三年间，她所在的大队，棉花亩产由十几斤跃增到百斤以上。
    汪秀兰娘家何家公社汪家畈，有一片片的油沙土，是长棉花的好地方。可是，婆家尚市公社星荣大队却是光秃秃的黄土岗，土质差，棉花产量历来每亩只有一、二十斤，咋能提高产量？干部社员们送她走的时候对她说：“黄土岗潜力大，再困难也不要怕。事在人为！”汪秀兰半信半疑地来到黄土岗。
    岗上人们听说秀兰来，一个个从心里欢迎她。选她担任团支部书记。有的人说：“秀兰在平畈是个棉花状元，到岗上来晓得能不能考个棉花秀才？”
    一天，区委副书记郭相刚来看她，鼓励她说：“平畈在咱区只占三分之一，岗地却占三分之二。你能摸索出一条岗地棉花高产经验来，作用要大得多。”
    郭相刚的话打动了秀兰的心。她想，自己是共产党员，就要听党的话，党叫干啥就干啥！
    秀兰决心想搞试验田，又担心家里不支持。秀兰的爱人参军去了，家里人口多，劳力少，种试验田和忙家务有没有矛盾？秀兰心里多了一层忧虑。
    不久，区委书记常东昌也来到秀兰家，问秀兰：“你想过没有，当媳妇和当姑娘有什么不同？”年轻的秀兰没有考虑过这些，没吭声。常东昌接着说：“当媳妇得学勤快点，凡事细心些，这样，你去工作或是帮助家里人进步，他们才能乐意。”几句话，使秀兰十分感动。从此，她一回到家就帮忙做饭、洗衣，给弟妹做针线。家里有事先和老人商量，办完又认真向老人交代清楚。公公笑着说：“领导上看重你，你就去为大家做事吧！家里的事不在乎你一个人。”婆婆也说：“你放心去种试验田，家务事有我。”
    汪秀兰要在黄土岗上作棉花高产试验，这件事很快在整个大队传开了。一九六三年春节一过，她就带着队长为她安排的社员，挑塘泥、整地、开沟、播种，样样都按照办试验田的标准干，一点也不马虎。在整地的时候，翻出许多砖头瓦块和麻骨石，秀兰就一块一块地拣，这引起好多人的注意。秀兰的试验田里的棉花种下以后，间了一次苗，棵是棵，行是行，又嫩又壮，吸引了本队和周围的许多社员。他们议论纷纷，觉得黄土岗能长出这样的棉苗，实在不简单。秀兰的老奶奶也搬出椅子，坐在田边，帮孙媳妇赶鸡撵猪。
    到了摘棉花的时候，秀兰的棉田里一片银白。队上的老妈妈都争着要到秀兰的试验田里摘花。她们说，摘了一辈子的躬腰花，秀兰姑娘种了试验田，就叫我们摘直腰花。
    就在这头一年，秀兰在黄土岗上种的第一块高产试验田，平均单产皮棉达到一百四十二斤。
    岗坡薄地上的棉花获得高产的消息，轰动了全大队，解放了人们的思想。大家感到黄土岗大有奔头，纷纷要求搞试验田。群众的热情更加增强了秀兰的信心。
    一九六四年春天，汪秀兰参加了全省农业劳动模范大会。省委负责同志在大会上作报告，要大家通过试验田的示范作用，实现大面积平衡增产。回队以后，秀兰把会议的精神向党支部作了汇报。党支部决定，一面继续抓高产试验田，一面要狠抓大面积平衡增产。从此，秀兰不光精心地管好自己的试验田，还把各队的棉花姑娘组成试验组，扩大试验田的面积，培养更多的植棉能手。试验田的面积占大队棉田面积将近一半。
    第二队的王明英和侯秀芳都种了试验田。公社召开棉花姑娘会，队里派侯秀芳去参加，王明英想：为什么不派我去？为这事哭了一场。秀兰想，姑娘们的这些表现，一方面是出于办试验田的积极性，另方面也反映了她们对办试验田的目的认识不清。她把这个想法跟党支部谈了，党支部书记和其他委员认为：这个问题不解决，群众的积极性就不能长久保住，他们叫秀兰对姑娘们多做一些工作。
    一天，秀兰把大队二十多个棉花姑娘召集起来开了个会，她让大家想一想：我们办试验是为了个人，还是为了革命？是为了出名当模范，还是为了改变黄土岗的低产面貌？接着，就组织大家学习《为人民服务》和雷锋的模范事迹，开展了讨论。王明英说：“领导没有叫我去开会，就不满意，这不对，这是为了个人。秀兰姐姐讲的对，我们搞试验不是为了出头露面显个名，是为了改变黄土岗面貌。”刘永英也说：“雷锋光考虑革命不想自己，我们办试验田也不能为个人，要为革命。”通过讨论，大家提高了认识，明确了办试验田是为了改变低产面貌，建设社会主义新农村，对人民对国家做出更大贡献。这以后，姑娘们办试验田的劲头更大了。
    三年间，星荣大队发生了十分可喜的变化，全大队棉花单产一九六二年还只有十几斤，一九六五年二百八十亩棉花突破了百斤皮棉关。但是，变化最大的还是人们的精神面貌。这个变化既教育了秀兰也教育了群众，人们认识到了黄土岗上大有潜力，大有可为。
