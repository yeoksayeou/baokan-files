    Using the words "completely" and "thoroughly" to examine
      The question of "serving whom" is the touchstone for testing true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries. Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people completely and thoroughly. A revolutionary needs to constantly use the words "completely" and "thoroughly" to spur himself on. If one is content with the status quo in thought, one will stagnate. I have had this experience: In the past, I often spoke of "serving the people" and knew in my mind that I should strive for the cause of communism to the end, but in my work things often went contrary to my wishes, and I often made mistakes and had loopholes. What is the reason for this? It is that the question of "serving whom" has not been resolved. In recent years, through studying Chairman Mao's works, combined with my thoughts and work, and constantly checking myself against them, I have made some progress in various aspects. This has made me deeply realize that to transform my own thinking, I must arm my mind with Chairman Mao's stand, viewpoints, and methods. The more Chairman Mao's ideological nourishment is absorbed into my mind, the greater the effect of my work will be. After understanding this truth, the question of "how to serve well" becomes easier to find the answer to.
    I think the question of "serving whom" is a fundamental question and should be placed in the primary position of all work.

    用“完全”“彻底”四字来检查
      “为谁服务”的问题，是检验真革命还是假革命的试金石。毛主席教导我们要完全彻底地为人民服务，一个革命者需要经常用“完全”“彻底”四个字来鞭策自己。如果思想上满足现状，就会停滞不前。我有这样的体会：过去我在口头上常常也讲“为人民服务”，在思想上也知道为共产主义事业奋斗到底，但是在工作中往往事与愿违，经常出差错、出漏洞。这是什么原因呢？就是“为谁服务”的问题还没有解决。这些年来通过学习毛主席著作，结合思想和工作，经常对照检查，各方面就有了一些进步。使我深深体会到要改造自己的思想，必须用毛主席的立场、观点和方法来武装自己的头脑。脑子里吸收毛主席的思想营养越多，工作成效就越大。懂得这个道理以后，至于“怎样服务得好”的问题，就容易找答案了。
    我想，“为谁服务”的问题是根本问题，要摆在一切工作的首要地位。
