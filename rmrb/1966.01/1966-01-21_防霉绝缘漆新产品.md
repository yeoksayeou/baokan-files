    New Anti-Mold Insulating Varnish Product
    The Shanghai Kailin Paint Factory recently produced a new anti-mold insulating varnish to replace the old product.
    The old product was made by adding a mildew-proofing agent to insulating varnish. Because the mildew-proofing agent was easy to volatilize, the effective anti-mold time of this type of varnish was relatively short. The newly successfully trial-produced anti-mold insulating varnish does not need to have additional mildew-proofing agent added; it possesses anti-mold properties itself, and its anti-mold reliability is even better.
    Based on the trial production of this new anti-mold insulating varnish, the Kailin Paint Factory also trial-produced five new varieties, some of which can be used to impregnate high-speed motor rotors, some can be used to spray the outer layer of motor windings, and some can be used to seal radio components.

    防霉绝缘漆新产品
    上海开林油漆厂最近生产出一种新的防霉绝缘漆代替了过去的老产品。
    老产品是在绝缘漆中加上防霉剂制成的。由于防霉剂容易挥发，这种漆的防霉有效时间比较短。新近试制成功的防霉绝缘漆，不必另外加防霉剂，本身就有防霉性能，而且防霉的可靠性更好。
    在试制这种新防霉绝缘漆的基础上，开林油漆厂还试制了五个新品种，其中有的可以用来浸渍高速电机转子，有的可以用来喷涂电机绕组外层，有的可以用来涂封无线电元件。
