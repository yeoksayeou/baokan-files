    Unified Guarantee, Saving, and Delivery
    —Experiences in Dynamically Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works in Financial Work
    Daqing Oilfield General Accounting Office
    In the past few years, we have consistently dynamically studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in our financial work, struggling against various old frameworks and habits, and striving to revolutionize our work. In the process of revolutionization, our experiences can be summarized in four characters: “Unified, Guarantee, Saving, Delivery.”

      Grasping the Main Contradiction to Find a Way Out in "Unified"
    In the early stage of oilfield construction, due to the decentralization of financial power, scheduling was ineffective. Among the one hundred and seven accounting points, some had money, some had no money; those with money couldn't transfer it, and those without money kept asking for it from above. Financial work was very passive. What to do? We studied "On Contradiction" to analyze and solve the problems in our work. Only then did we realize that the main contradiction at that time was: the decentralized management of funds was not adapted to the centralized advantage of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles in production. The solution was to unify the management of money and use it centrally. Therefore, with the approval of the higher authorities, we canceled the one hundred and seven accounting points and changed them to one accounting unit under the headquarters.
    As soon as this measure was proposed, it caused a great shock. Some people said, "Implementing centralized accounting in such a large enterprise is unheard of at home and abroad. It would be a major disaster if it were messed up!" Some said that this kind of accounting was "neither fish nor fowl." However, most people believed that "to make revolution, you have to have the spirit of daring. When we encounter new problems in our work that our predecessors haven't encountered, we must create our own experience and take our own path in practice."
    While implementing centralized accounting, we also reformed the accounting system and simplified accounting procedures. As a result, the scheduling of funds became more flexible. In that year alone, the funds for equipment procurement increased by more than 30 million yuan, ensuring the supply of materials and money for production. Some problems that were originally considered "major difficulties" were also solved.

    Starting from Actual Needs to Promote Production in "Guarantee"
      "Unified Management" is a means, and "Guaranteeing Production" is the goal. The fundamental task of financial work is to guarantee the great development of production.
    In order to make equipment reach the "Five Goods" standard, the leadership was determined that any equipment that did not meet the "Five Goods" standard would be resolutely sealed up for repair. How the financial department should implement this policy was a major issue. At that time, the opinion of a few drivers was: the production task is heavy, there are not enough vehicles, if sealed, they would have to be unsealed, so it is better not to seal them. However, we resolutely implemented the policy that equipment must be repaired, and spent four million yuan to hire horse-drawn carts to resolutely seal up a batch of equipment. At this time, some individuals said that we were "wasting money with our eyes open." We were not intimidated by these arguments, and we calculated both the economic and political costs. We believed that if we only saw the small benefit of saving four million yuan in front of us, we would not be able to establish a solid work style of doing what we said, and there would be no "Five Goods" equipment. Sure enough, after hiring horse-drawn carts, production went up, "Five Goods" equipment was achieved, and the equipment attendance rate also increased. In this way, what we got back was not four million, but many times four million, and the power generated by the solid work style we established was even impossible to calculate in terms of money. As some financial personnel said, "Looking ahead when calculating accounts, it's more than just four million. Remembering Chairman Mao's words, the benefits are immeasurable." Using Mao Zedong Thought to calculate accounts, one yuan can really become two, and two yuan can save one, the more you calculate, the more active the money becomes, and the more you calculate, the more money you have.

    Adhering to Running Enterprises Diligently and Frugally to Tap Potential in "Saving"
      "Guarantee" and "Saving" are sometimes contradictory, but they can also be unified. "Saving" is for better "Guarantee," but "Guarantee" must have "Saving" within it, and you cannot only hold onto the "watermelon" and not pick up the "sesame seeds." Chairman Mao often taught us to run enterprises diligently and frugally. Our principle is: if it is not beneficial to production, we won't spend a cent, and we will resolutely stop it. During the Spring Festival of 1963, a unit bought a few yuan worth of New Year's cards. Although the amount of money was small, it was spent inappropriately, so we resolutely refused to reimburse them. In the end, the grass-roots finance chief had to pay for it himself. Some people said that we were "unreasonable," but most people said: "It's right to stop it. What's being stopped is not just a few yuan, not just a few New Year's cards, but the tendency of extravagance and waste." Through these things, everyone was educated, and the style of diligence and frugality was greatly promoted. In the past few years, we have compressed non-productive cash expenditures by more than ten million yuan.
    To achieve "Saving," you must put in hard work and do "stupid" things. The method is to break the old frameworks, and those who manage money should jump out of the circle of money to manage things and manage usage; money is dead, but using money and using things is alive. We went deep into the field to investigate and research, and grasped the living situation. When personnel responsible for fund scheduling approved plans, they went to the grass-roots warehouses to understand the situation, check the physical objects, and check the needs. What should be increased was increased, and what should be reduced was reduced, which was both beneficial to production and avoided waste.

    Considering Everything for the Grassroots to Make Revolution in "Delivery"
    With the centralization of financial power, a large amount of business was taken over by the organs, and more and more people from the grass-roots level ran to the organs to handle affairs, which created a contradiction between going down and coming up. Should we sit in the office and wait for people to come up to handle affairs? Or should the organs take the initiative to go down to serve the grass-roots level? We organized employees to repeatedly study articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and let employees discuss. Once the employees' awareness was raised, they no longer sat and waited, but started to go and deliver. We delivered wages, meal tickets, bath tickets, and movie tickets to the workers. Anything that could be delivered, we tried our best to deliver to the grass-roots level.
    This may seem more troublesome, but convenience and trouble can be transformed into each other. With the determination to take on "trouble," the less trouble there will be, because "trouble" will also become convenience; without the determination to deliver convenience, the more trouble there will be, because convenience will also become trouble. We deliver wages and deliver money to the door. It seems to have troubled the accountants and made it easier for the workers, but in fact the accountants' troubles have been reduced. Before delivery, the people lining up to collect wages and calculate reimbursements crowded the office, affecting the normal operation of work. We were very passive. Isn't this a big "trouble"? After delivering it down, the phenomenon of congestion in the office disappeared, our work became active, and didn't the trouble become convenience? Not to mention, doing so is a great encouragement to the grass-roots cadres and the masses. They said, "You not only deliver wages, but also deliver revolutionary zeal."

    统保省送
    ——在财务工作中活学活用毛主席著作的体会
    大庆油田总会计室
    几年来，我们在财务工作上一直活学活用毛主席著作，同各种老框框和习惯势力进行斗争，努力使自己的工作革命化。在革命化的过程中，我们的体会概括起来是四个字：“统、保、省、送”。
      抓住主要矛盾在“统”字上找出路
    油田建设初期，由于财权分散，调度不灵。一百零七个核算点上，有的有钱，有的没钱；有钱的调不上来，没钱的一个劲地向上要。财务工作很被动，怎么办？我们就学习了《矛盾论》分析和解决我们工作上的问题，这才认识到当时的主要矛盾是：资金的分散管理与生产上的集中优势兵力打歼灭战不相适应。解决的办法，只有把钱统一管起，集中使用。于是，经过上级批准，取消了一百零七个核算点，改为指挥部一个核算单位。
    这项措施一提出来，就引起很大震动。有人说：“这样大的企业实行集中核算，古今中外还没有听说过，搞乱了可不是小事情！”有人说，这样核算是“四不象”。但是，多数人认为，“干革命就得有点闯的精神，工作中碰到一些前人没有碰到的新问题，我们就要在实践中创造自己的经验，走自己的路。”
    我们在实行集中核算的同时，相应地改革了核算制度，简化了核算手续。这样一来，资金调度更加灵活了，当年就增加了器材采购用款三千多万元，生产用料、用钱有了保证。一些原来认为“老大难”的问题也跟着解决了。
    从实际需要出发在“保”字上促生产
      “统一管理”是手段，“保证生产”才是目的。财务工作的根本任务，就是保证生产的大发展。
    为了使设备达到“五好”的标准，领导上下定决心，凡是不符合五好标准的设备，就坚决封上进行修理。财务部门如何贯彻这个方针，是一个大问题。当时，少数司机的议论是：生产任务重，车子不够用，封了还得揭，不如不加封。但是，我们还是坚决贯彻设备必须维修的方针，拿出四百万元来雇马车，坚决封了一批设备。这时，个别人说我们是“睁着眼睛浪费”，我们没有被这些论调吓倒，既算了经济账，又算了政治账。我们认为，如果只看到拿出四百万元这个眼前的小利，就不能树立说到办到的过硬作风，就不会有五好设备。果然，雇了马车以后，生产上去了，五好设备实现了，设备出勤率也提高了。这样，换来的不是四百万，而是许多个四百万，而树立起来的过硬作风所产生的力量，更是无法用钱计算。正如有的财务人员说的：“算账向前看，何止四百万，牢记主席话，收益算不完。”用毛主席的思想算账，真是一个钱能变成两个，两个钱能省下一个，越算钱越活，越算钱越多。
    坚持勤俭办企业在“省”字上挖潜力
      “保”和“省”有时是有矛盾的，但也是可以统一的，“省”是为了更好地“保”，但“保”中必须有“省”，不能光抱“西瓜”，不拣“芝麻”。毛主席经常教导我们，要勤俭办企业。我们的原则是：不利生产，一毛不拔，坚决卡死。一九六三年春节，有一个单位买了几元钱的贺年片，钱虽不多，但花得不对，我们就坚决不给报销。最后，基层财务科长自己赔上了。有人说我们“不通情理”，多数人说：“卡的对，卡的不是几个钱，不是几张贺年片，卡的是铺张浪费的苗头。”通过这些事情，教育了大家，勤俭之风就大大发扬起来。几年来，我们压缩了非生产性现金支出一千多万元。
    要做到“省”，必须下苦功夫做“笨”事情。办法就是打破旧框框，管钱的人跳出钱的圈子去管物、管用；钱是死的，但用钱、用物是活的。我们就深入现场去调查研究，抓活的情况。资金调度人员审批计划时，都到基层仓库去了解情况，核对实物，核对需要，该增就增，该减就减，既有利于生产，又避免了浪费。
    一切为基层着想在“送”字上闹革命
    财权集中，大量的业务揽到了机关来做，基层跑机关办事的人越来越多，就出现了下去和上来的矛盾，是坐在办公室等人上来办事呢？还是机关主动下去为基层服务？我们组织职工反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，让职工讨论，职工的觉悟一提高，就不再坐而等，是起而送了。我们把工资、饭票、澡票、电影票等送到工人手里。凡是有条件送的东西，我们都尽力送到基层。
    这看起来好象麻烦一些，但是，方便和麻烦，是可以互相转化的，有决心揽“麻烦”，麻烦就越揽越少，因为“麻烦”也会变成方便；没决心送方便，麻烦反而会越来越多，因为方便也会变成麻烦。我们送工资，送钱上门，看来是麻烦了会计，方便了工人，实际上会计的麻烦反而减少了。未送以前，排队领工资、算报销的人，把办公室挤得满满的，影响工作正常开展，我们十分被动，这岂不是大“麻烦”？送下去后，办公室拥挤的现象没有了，我们的工作主动了，麻烦不就变成了方便？更不要说，这样做，对基层干部和群众是极大的鼓舞，他们说：“你们不只送来工资，而且送来了革命干劲。”
