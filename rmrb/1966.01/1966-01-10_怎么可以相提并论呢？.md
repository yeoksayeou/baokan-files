    How Can They Be Compared?
    By Our Correspondent
    The Johnson government has set up a "negotiation" table, saying to the Vietnamese people: Come, "Hanoi's Four Points" can be "discussed together" with America's "Fourteen Points."
    The White House's words are also meant for the whole world. It wants to tell people: Look, how "fair" is America's attitude! Since it is a "negotiation," your opinions can be put forward, and my opinions can also be put forward!
    The Johnson government's stance cannot deceive anyone. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points, and Washington's "Fourteen Points," how can they be compared?
    People can't help but ask: What should be the criterion for resolving the Vietnam issue? First, it should be the will of the Vietnamese people. Because the Vietnamese people are the masters of Vietnam. Vietnam's affairs are decided by the Vietnamese people, not by the US government. Second, it should be the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, which prohibit foreign troops, military personnel, and weapons of all kinds from entering Vietnam, and prohibit the establishment of foreign military bases. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points are entirely in line with these two basic principles. Without these two points, there can be no political solution to the Vietnam issue.
    The starting point of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points is: Vietnam is a unified whole, and Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity are inviolable; foreign countries must not interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs. Therefore, the American invading troops must withdraw from South Vietnam completely, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems. This not only expresses the common will of the 31 million Vietnamese people, but also embodies the basic provisions of the Geneva Accords. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points are the only basis and the most correct path for a political solution to the Vietnam issue.
    No matter what the Johnson government says, in fact, it has not recognized, and will never accept, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points. In the past, it touted "unconditional discussions," which was a fundamental rejection of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points. Now, it has put forward a "Fourteen Points" counter-proposal, demanding "joint discussion," which is just a gesture, and its position remains unchanged.
    The "Fourteen Points" are contrary to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points, and are irreconcilable. So, what does the Johnson government's so-called "joint discussion" mean?
    This is equivalent to saying that Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity are not sacred and inviolable, but are "discussable," negotiable, and can be traded through "negotiations." This is a great insult to the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese people will never agree to it. This is also an extreme contempt for the Geneva Accords. The Johnson government's statement that "the Geneva Accords will provide an adequate basis for peace in Southeast Asia" is completely deceptive nonsense.
    To put it bluntly, the Johnson government is attempting to bury the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Four Points with its "Fourteen Points." The so-called "joint discussion" is merely to deceive the world. The insidious part of the Johnson government is that it disguises itself as if it is reasonable and willing to "negotiate." By doing so, it attempts to shift the responsibility for undermining the political solution of the Vietnam issue onto the Vietnamese people, in order to shed the guilt of the United States' expanding war of aggression. However, no matter how hard the Johnson government racks its brains, this malicious plot will not succeed.
    The British weekly *Tribune*, published on January 7, wrote in reference to the Johnson government's "Fourteen Points": "The United States must now answer the important question: Is it really willing to withdraw?" This question precisely hits the Johnson government's sore spot. On this point, US imperialism never changes its nature: the American invading troops will never withdraw. In Rusk's recent words, "The United States will remain in South Vietnam until the Saigon government (puppet clique) is stabilized and its independence is no longer in doubt." Listen to Rusk's voice, and look at the military deployments of the United States as it intensifies preparations to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, and what the Johnson government's so-called "joint discussion" of both sides' opinions is all about becomes clear!

    怎么可以相提并论呢？
    本报评论员
    约翰逊政府摆开“谈判”桌，向越南人民说：来吧，“河内的四点主张”可以同美国的“十四点”主张“一起讨论”。
    白宫的这番话，也是说给全世界听的。它想要告诉人们：请看，美国的态度是多么“公允”！既然是“谈判”，你的意见可以摆出来，我的意见也可以摆出来嘛！
    约翰逊政府的这种姿态，是迷惑不了人的。越南民主共和国的四点主张，同华盛顿的“十四点”主张，怎么可以相提并论呢？
    人们不禁要问：越南问题的解决，应该以什么为准则？第一，应该以越南人民的意志为准则。因为越南人民是越南的主人。越南的事务，是越南人民说了算，而不是美国政府说了算。第二，应该以关于越南问题的日内瓦协议为准则，根据日内瓦协议，禁止外国军队、军事人员和各种武器进入越南，不得建立外国军事基地。越南民主共和国的四点主张，是完全符合这两个基本准则的。离开了这两点，就谈不上什么越南问题的政治解决。
    越南民主共和国的四点主张的出发点是：越南是个统一的整体，越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整不容侵犯，外国不得干涉越南的内政。因此，美国侵略军必须全部撤出南越，让越南人民自己解决自己的问题。这不仅表达了三千一百万越南人民的共同意志，也是日内瓦协议各项基本条款的集中体现。越南民主共和国的四点主张，是政治解决越南问题的唯一基础，也是最正确的途径。
    不管约翰逊政府口头上怎么说，其实，它并没有承认，并且也决不会接受越南民主共和国的四点主张。过去，它标榜“无条件讨论”，就是根本拒绝越南民主共和国的四点主张。现在，它提出了一个“十四点”的对案，要求“一起讨论”，也不过是作一点姿态而已，立场原封未动。
    “十四点”主张同越南民主共和国的四点主张，是背道而驰的，是水火不相容的。那么，约翰逊政府的所谓两者“一起讨论”，究竟是什么意思呢？
    这等于说，越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整不是神圣不可侵犯的，而是“可以讨论的”，可以讨价还价的，可以通过“谈判”来进行交易的。这是对越南人民的极大侮辱，是越南人民绝对不会同意的。这也是对日内瓦协议的极端蔑视。约翰逊政府说什么“日内瓦协议将会为东南亚和平提供充足的基础”，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    拆穿了说，约翰逊政府企图用它的“十四点”来埋葬越南民主共和国的四点主张。所谓“一起讨论”，不过是为了迷惑世人的耳目。约翰逊政府的阴险之处在于，它把自己装扮成好象是通情达理的，是愿意“谈判”的。它这样作，是企图把破坏越南问题政治解决的责任推在越南人民身上，以卸掉美国扩大侵略战争的罪责。可是，不管约翰逊政府怎样挖空心思，这一恶毒的图谋是不可能得逞的。
    一月七日出版的英国《论坛》周刊，在谈到约翰逊政府的“十四点”主张时写道，“美国现在必须回答这样一个重要的问题：它到底是否愿意撤走？”这个问题恰好打着约翰逊政府的痛处。在这一点上，美帝国主义是万变不离其宗：美国侵略军决不撤走。用腊斯克最近发表的话来说，就是：“美国将留在南越，直到西贡政府（傀儡集团）得到稳定，以及它的独立再没有疑问”。听听腊斯克的声音，再看看美国加紧准备扩大侵越战争的军事部署，约翰逊政府的所谓双方意见“一起讨论”是个什么玩意儿，也就一清二楚了！
