    Transplantation is also a creative labor
    ——Watching the performances of small plays by the China Peking Opera Theatre   Wu Dongtao
    Recently, the China Peking Opera Theatre, in a short span of ten days or so, transplanted fourteen small-scale theatrical works from excellent modern dramas of nine different opera genres from Central South, East China, Northeast, and Northwest regions. These include Hunan Flower Drum Opera "Beating the Gong," Qi Opera "Delivering Grain," Chu Opera "Two Teachers Guiding Their Son," Henan Henan Opera "Touring the Countryside," Yue Opera "Stealing Melons from the Garden," as well as Peking Opera "Dugufeng," Opera "Hongsong Store," Spoken Drama "Bayonets See Red," etc. This is the crystallization of the China Peking Opera Theatre's dedication to learning from local operas and their hard work.
    This is a very meaningful endeavor. It not only prepares repertoire for Peking Opera to deeply serve the countryside and the peasant brothers but also enriches the Peking Opera art with fresh blood through the practice of transplanting local small operas, which is conducive to the in-depth development of the revolutionization of Peking Opera. It demonstrates the continuous revolutionary spirit of the comrades of the Peking Opera Theatre, and it also demonstrates that a movement of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing is unfolding widely on the cultural front.
    After watching the performances, we believe that the transplantation is successful. These small operas after transplantation are both new operas and Peking Operas. The transplantation practice once again affirms the question of whether Peking Opera art can express the contemporary life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it also makes useful attempts to solve the problem of how to Peking Operaize local operas during transplantation.
    The most important point is that the transplanters have a correct understanding of the common characteristics of these local small operas, that is, focusing on the profound thoughts, strong life atmosphere, and rich local color of these operas, rather than simply paying attention to certain artistic features. In this way, the core of solving all problems in transplantation is grasped. Transplanting local operas is actually learning from local operas; learning from local operas is mainly learning its new life content and artistic temperament. Therefore, the so-called Peking Operaization of transplantation, the problem of adapting local operas to the characteristics of Peking Opera, is essentially also solving the contradiction between the new life content and the artistic form of Peking Opera. Based on such an understanding, when encountering the difficulty of Peking Operaization in the transplantation, the attitude adopted by the Peking Opera Theatre is not to first emphasize how to make the local opera passively adapt to the characteristics of Peking Opera, but how to make Peking Opera adapt to the needs of new life content and character, and carry out active and positive creation on the basis of maintaining the Peking Opera style, learning modestly and absorbing boldly. In these plays, there are various character traits that cannot be found in the old Peking Opera roles, and novel and lively dance movements that are rarely seen in the Peking Opera performance formulas. In particular, the music and singing prominently demonstrate the transplanters' spirit of modest learning and courage to innovate. Music is the main symbol and lifeline of an opera genre, and it is the most stable factor constituting a genre. It is the most difficult to integrate with new external factors during transplantation. Because Peking Opera art has been divorced from the working people for a long time, its musical system, from structure to mode, is relatively solidified and rigid, and is quite far from the new life content and the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Even if new lyrics are added, singing it often gives people the feeling of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. Therefore, in this transplantation, they adopted the principle of resolutely starting from life, and according to the needs of the content, in many places, they boldly retained and absorbed some structures, tunes, rhythms, and folk song styles from local operas to transform and enrich themselves, and created new Peking Opera modes, melodies, and tunes. For example, the transplanted "Rainbow" not only incorporated the flavor of Hakka folk songs in the singing but also used some tunes from Peking-style drum and Bangzi opera. Many plays borrowed some local-colored arrangements without any changes. In "Hongsong Store," which was transplanted from the opera, we even heard the accompaniment of Western musical instruments. In terms of structure, when encountering the singing structure that is commonly used in many local operas but rarely seen or absent in Peking Opera, such as the large section of storytelling and singing in "Beating the Gong"; the duet singing of pulling the bellows in "Mending the Pot"; the singing and dancing in "Touring the Countryside," etc., the transplanters did not avoid it by adapting the script, but tried every means to break through the old Peking Opera singing structure, learn from local operas, and create new corresponding structures. If Xipi and Erhuang didn't work, they would use miscellaneous tunes, folk songs, and bozi tunes. For example, "Beating the Gong" uses small tunes to handle the storytelling and singing structure, singing and speaking, which sounds quite unique. If it is really difficult to handle and cannot express the original structural characteristics, the local opera's singing is simply followed. For example, in the duet singing of Li Xiaocong and Liu Lanying pulling the bellows in "Mending the Pot," the "bozi" tune was used in the first few performances. Listening to it, it always felt that the musical effect was not commensurate with the life scene on the stage and the happy rhythm of labor, so the original tune in the flower drum opera was simply used to match this duet singing, but it felt comfortable and fresh.
    Of course, since it is a Peking Opera performance, it must be like Peking Opera. Therefore, at the same time, the transplanters also made full use of the strengths of Peking Opera art with a realistic attitude, without harming the content. When sorting out the script, appropriate changes were made in the structure to make the more scattered singing in some plays with stronger singing more concentrated; the lyrics maintained the life atmosphere and humor of the local opera language. However, in terms of prosody and vocabulary, necessary adjustments were made in consideration of the standardization of Peking Opera music and Beijing dialect. The performance is basically the way of local opera, but the places where the strengths of Peking Opera can be brought into play are not missed, such as making the performance rhythm of some main scenes stronger, and the body movements more concise. In terms of music, although there are some absorptions and changes, the mode design of each play basically adheres to the Peking Opera's Xipi, Erhuang, or small tunes as the keynote, plus the supplement of interludes, trailing sounds, arrangements, and accompaniments, it still sounds like Peking Opera. Structurally, flexible handling was also carried out based on the principle of starting from life in relatively difficult places. For those relatively ready-made places, the transplanters did not take advantage of the convenience and muddle through. They also repeatedly pondered how to bring into play the strengths of Peking Opera music from the needs of the content in order to improve it.
    Practice has proved that the Peking Opera Theatre's practices are successful, and especially worthy of affirmation is this modest and serious attitude. Although it is transplantation, it has put in hard work like treating creation. Learning is active learning, not copying without any changes, but digesting it. Peking Operaization is not passive adaptation, simply putting some old things of Peking Opera on it is considered complete, but it is creating something. Hard work will never fail people, and the success of the transplantation has made the Peking Opera Theatre take another step forward on the road of revolutionization.
    Of course, due to the short time and unfamiliarity with life, as well as the limitations of form, there are still some shortcomings in the transplantation performance. But we believe that as long as the direction is clear, the attitude is correct, and adhering to the spirit of thorough revolution, long-term adherence to in-depth life practice, in the great situation of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing, the comrades of the China Peking Opera Theatre will surely continue to create, invent, and advance.

### 移植也是一种创造性的劳动——看中国京剧院一批小戏的演出

    移植也是一种创造性的劳动
    ——看中国京剧院一批小戏的演出    武东涛
    最近，中国京剧院在短短的十来天里，从中南、华东、东北、西北等地区九个剧种的优秀现代戏中，一下子移植了十四出小型剧目，这里面既有湖南花鼓《打铜锣》、祁剧《送粮》、楚剧《双教子》、河南曲剧《游乡》、越调《扒瓜园》，也有京剧《杜骨峰》、歌剧《红松店》、话剧《刺刀见红》等等，这是中国京剧院虚心向地方戏学习、辛勤劳动的结晶。
    这是件很有意义的事，不仅为京剧深入农村、为农民兄弟服务准备了剧目，而且通过移植地方小戏的实践，使京剧艺术增添了新的血液，有利于京剧革命化的深入开展。表现了京剧院的同志们的不断革命精神，也表现了文化战线上的一个比学赶帮超的运动正在广泛展开。
    看了演出，我们认为移植是成功的，移植后的这些小戏，既是新戏又是京戏。移植实践，对京剧艺术能否表现当代工农兵生活这个问题，再一次作了肯定回答，对京剧移植地方戏如何解决京剧化的问题，也作了有益的尝试。
    最重要的一点，是移植者对这些地方小戏的共同特点有正确的理解，即着眼于这些戏的思想深刻、强烈的生活气息和浓厚的地方色彩，而不单是注意某些艺术形式上的特色。这样，就抓住了解决移植中所有问题的核心。移植地方戏实际是学习地方戏；学习地方戏主要是学习它新的生活内容和艺术气质。因此，所谓移植的京剧化，使地方戏适应京剧特点的问题，实质上也是解决新的生活内容与京剧艺术形式的矛盾问题。基于这样一种认识，京剧院的移植，在遇到京剧化的难题时，他们所持的态度，不是先强调怎样使地方戏来消极地适应京剧特点，而是使京剧如何适应新的生活内容和人物性格的需要，在保持京剧风格的基础上，进行主动、积极地创造，虚心学习，大胆吸收。在这些戏里，有各种各样为京剧旧行当里所找不到的人物性格，为京剧表演程式里所不多见的新颖活泼舞蹈身段。特别是音乐和唱腔，更突出地表现了移植者的虚心学习和勇于革新的精神。音乐，是一个戏曲剧种的主要标志和命脉，是构成一个剧种的最稳固的因素，移植时最难于与新的外来的因素融合。由于京剧艺术长期脱离劳动人民，其音乐体系，从结构到板腔都比较凝固和呆板，与新的生活内容、劳动人民的思想感情相距颇远，即使配上新词，唱起来也常常给人以帝王将相、才子佳人的气度之感。因此，在这次移植中，他们采取了坚决从生活出发的原则，根据内容的需要，许多地方，大胆保留和吸收了地方戏曲中的一些结构、音调、节奏和民歌风，用以改造丰富自己，创造了新的京剧板式、旋律和音调。如移植后的《彩虹》，在唱腔里不但揉进了客家山歌的风味，还利用京韵大鼓和梆子腔里的一些音调。不少戏里原样不动的借用了一些富有地方色彩的配曲，从歌剧移植过来的《红松店》里，我们甚至听到了西洋乐器的伴奏。结构方面，当遇到许多地方戏里常用、而在京戏里却不多见或者没有的唱腔结构时，如《打铜锣》的大段说唱；《补锅》中的拉风箱那段对唱；《游乡》中的载歌载舞等等。移植者不是靠改编剧本来加以回避，而是想方设法突破旧的京剧唱腔结构，向地方戏学习，创造新的相应的结构，西皮、二黄不行就用杂曲、山歌、拨子。比如《打铜锣》就是采用小曲来处理说唱结构的，边唱边说，听起来倒也很别致。实在处理不好、表现不了原来的结构特色的，就干脆沿用地方戏的唱腔。如《补锅》里李小聪与刘兰英拉风箱的那段对唱，开始几场演出用的是“拨子”，听起来，总觉得音乐效果与舞台上的生活情景、欢快的劳动节奏不相称，就干脆用了花鼓戏里原来的曲子来配这段对唱，反而觉得舒服、清新。
    当然，演的既是京戏，还必须要象京戏。所以，与此同时，移植者也以实事求是的态度，在不损害内容的前提下，充分发挥了京剧艺术的特长。剧本整理时，在结构上作了适当的改动，使歌唱性较强的一些戏里比较零散的唱更集中；唱词，保持了地方戏曲语言的生活气息和风趣。但在声律和词汇方面，考虑到京剧音乐和北京方言的规范，作了必要的调整。表演，基本上是地方戏的路子，但在可以发挥京剧特长的地方也不放过，比如使一些主要场次的表演节奏感更强，身段动作更洗练等等。音乐方面，尽管有所吸收和变化，但每个戏的板腔设计，都基本坚持了以京剧的西皮、二黄或小曲为基调，再加上过门、拖腔、配曲、伴奏的弥补，听起来仍不失京剧的韵味。结构上，在比较难办的地方，也本着从生活出发的原则作了灵活处理。对那些比较现成的地方，移植者也没有贪图方便，敷衍了事，同样是从内容的需要出发，反复琢磨怎样发挥京剧音乐的特长，以求完善。
    实践证明，京剧院的这些做法是成功的，尤其应该肯定的是这种虚心而且严肃认真的态度。虽然是移植，却象对待创作一样付出了艰苦的劳动。学习是积极的学习，不是原封不动地照搬，而是有所消化。京剧化也不是消极的适应，随便搁上一些京剧的旧东西就算完了，而是有所创造。辛勤的劳动是决不会辜负人的，移植的成功，使京剧院在革命化道路上又前进了一步。
    当然，由于时间太短和生活不熟，以及形式的局限，移植演出中还不够理想的地方是有的。但我们相信，只要方向明确，态度端正，本着彻底革命的精神、长期坚持深入生活实践，在比学赶帮超的大好形势下，中国京剧院的同志们一定会不断有所创造、有所发明，有所前进的。
