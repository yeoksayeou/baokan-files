    Editor's Note: The counties in Shanxi Province are running farmer training schools to help poor and lower-middle peasants and other working people study Chairman Mao's works. This is a good method.
    Chairman Mao's works are especially dear to the working people. Many workers and peasants find it easier to accept and apply Chairman Mao's works than intellectuals, and they use them very well. However, generally speaking, poor and lower-middle peasants have a relatively low level of education, and their study of Chairman Mao's works is inevitably limited to some extent. Therefore, it is very necessary to select a number of activists from among them for more systematic training, so that they can become the backbone and guiding force for studying Chairman Mao's works in the countryside.
    The counties in Shanxi Province take advantage of the slack farming season to run farmer training schools relying on Party schools, and according to the specific conditions of rural production and construction, they either gather a group of people to study in the county seat, or send teachers to the countryside and construction sites for guidance, to help farmers study Chairman Mao's works. Experience has shown that this has played a very good role in raising the socialist consciousness of farmers, strengthening political and ideological work in the countryside, promoting the three great revolutionary movements, and discovering and cultivating new forces.
    This newspaper reports that the counties (cities) in Shanxi Province are running farmer training schools to help the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and other working people study Chairman Mao's works, raise their revolutionary consciousness, and cultivate activists and grassroots organizational backbone in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside.
          Using Slack Season, Counties and Teams Operate Schools
    The farmer training schools run by the counties (cities) in Shanxi Province during the slack farming season from November 1964 to the end of March 1965 generally ran three to four sessions, training a total of 93,900 students. At the same time, production brigades, with the graduates of the county farmer training schools as the backbone, successively ran 6,834 farmer training schools (meetings), with more than 457,000 students participating in the training schools. After training in the farmer training schools (meetings), the students' class consciousness and socialist revolutionary consciousness were significantly improved, and their enthusiasm doubled. After returning to their villages, most of them played an active role, and some were elected as cadres; at the same time, thanks to the leadership of the Party branches and their driving force, millions of farmers throughout the province participated in Mao Zedong's works study groups, forming a surge in studying Chairman Mao's works in the vast countryside.
    The farmer training schools gave students lectures on eleven articles (chapters) in Chairman Mao's works, namely: "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "How to Analyze Rural Classes," "Establish the Dominance of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants," "'It's Terrible!' and 'It's Fine!'," "To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is a Good Thing and Not a Bad Thing," "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," "Continue to Maintain the Style of Hard Struggle," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" In addition, they also taught the part about the five requirements for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause in the "Nine Comments on the Open Letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU."
          Relying on the Masses to Select Students
    The county farmer training schools are specifically undertaken relying on Party schools. Each county generally has a leading group headed by a county standing committee member, and absorbing comrades from the propaganda, organization, rural political work departments, and the Communist Youth League, Women's Federation, and Armed Forces Department to lead the work of the farmer training schools. At the beginning of each session, the county Party secretary or a member of the standing committee would make a mobilization report to raise the students' awareness of learning. Some county Party secretaries participated in the work of the training schools and persisted to the end. Wei De'guan, deputy secretary of the Yongji County Party Committee, consistently grasped the work of the training schools, making the Yongji County Farmer Training School outstanding and a relatively good unit in the province.
    Relying on the masses and conscientiously selecting students is a very important experience in running farmer training schools well. All localities first widely publicized the importance of running farmer training schools and the conditions for selecting students, so that the broad masses realized that running farmer training schools well was a major event related to cultivating the backbone for building a new countryside, and that people with higher ideological awareness, active in labor, loving the collective, and upright in style among the poor and lower-middle peasants and other working people should be selected to study, and the list should be discussed and proposed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and then reported to the commune and county for examination and approval. In the selection of students, all localities also organized a certain force to go down and mobilize the masses. The Zuoquan County Farmer Training School ran a total of four sessions, and in each session, more than a dozen county cadres, led by a county standing committee member, went deep into the 204 production brigades with training tasks to help the masses select students. In this way, most of the students in the farmer training schools were activists who emerged from the peasants, with strong revolutionary demands. They were active and diligent in their studies, studying with class feelings and with problems in mind.
          Combining Theory with Practice to Learn Theory Well
    The farmer training schools must organize a strong teaching team, conduct teaching by combining theory with practice, and do a good job in teaching. In selecting teachers and counselors, attention should be paid to both quantity and quality. The 450 teachers and counselors in the counties of the Jinan area not only have political and theoretical levels, but also have practical struggle experience, and many of them have participated in the rural socialist education movement. Many teaching staff can do both teaching and going to the countryside to investigate and research, and live, eat, and study with the students, and also learn from the students.
    In teaching, the county farmer training schools divided the above twelve articles (chapters) into three units: class and class struggle, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and doing a good job as a successor to the proletarian revolution. Combined with teaching, they carried out activities such as recalling bitterness and complaining, visiting class education exhibitions, watching revolutionary operas, listening to reports from famous labor models, and visiting revolutionary heroes. When teaching class and class struggle, old poor peasants were invited to talk about family history, village history, and society history, and everyone was organized to recall bitterness and complain, and to visit the Socialist Education Exhibition Hall. When talking about the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, old peasants were invited to make reports comparing individual farming and collectivization, and so on. When talking about doing a good job as a revolutionary successor, they listened to the audio report of Zhou Mingshan, secretary of the Party branch of Nanliu Production Brigade, Nanfan Commune, Jiang County, on learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, and the audio report of Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Party branch of Dazhai Production Brigade, Xiyang County, on hard struggle, self-reliance, and serving the country, and some also visited local revolutionary veterans and listened to their revolutionary deeds. In this way, the broad masses of students understood Chairman Mao's thought and learned revolutionary theory through rich practical materials.
          Strengthening Guidance and Continuously Improving
    In order to enable the students who return to the villages from the training schools to better grow up in the three great revolutionary movements, the farmer training schools in various places carried out out-of-school guidance work to help students continuously improve their awareness. The counties in Jinan divided the whole county into several guidance areas. During the summer and autumn when the farmer training schools were closed, the staff of the schools went out of the campus and went to the countryside to help the students who returned to the villages continue to study Chairman Mao's works. Ruicheng County divided the 14 communes in the county into three guidance areas, east, west, and middle, according to the distribution of students, and selected a key point in each guidance area. The county training school organized three working groups to help the key points, gain experience, and guide the overall situation, and successively promoted five experiences in the county, such as the student organization study group of Caonan Production Brigade, Dongguan Commune, and promoted the students who returned to the villages in the county to continue to adhere to the study of Mao Zedong's works. Students in each production brigade have organized study groups, which often carry out activities to continuously improve their ideological awareness.
    Since last winter, according to the situation of large-scale construction of stable and high-yield farmland in various places, in addition to running a training class aimed at training teaching counselors for the brigade training schools, all the teachers of the county training schools have been divided into several groups, and have gone deep into the teaching stations of the communes and the training schools of the brigades to carry out roving lectures. This not only adapts to the situation of building stable and high-yield farmland, but also meets the increasingly urgent requirements of the broad masses of farmers to study Chairman Mao's works. And it is conducive to linking with reality, improving teaching, and improving teaching quality. (Attached picture)

    帮助农民学习毛主席著作的好办法
    山西各地农民讲习所培养出大批积极分子和基层骨干
    编者按：山西省各县举办农民讲习所，帮助贫农、下中农和其他劳动群众学习毛主席著作，这是一个好办法。
    毛主席的著作，对劳动人民来说，是特别亲切的。许多工人、农民学习毛主席著作，比知识分子更容易接受，学了就能用，而且用得很好。但是，一般地说，贫农、下中农的文化水平比较低，在学习毛主席著作的时候，不能不受到一定的限制。因此，在他们中间，挑选一部分积极分子，进行比较系统的训练，使他们成为农村学习毛主席著作的骨干和辅导力量，这就是十分必要的了。
    山西省各县利用农闲季节，依托党校举办农民讲习所，根据农村生产和建设的具体情况，或者调集一部分人到县城来学习，或者派教员到农村和工地去辅导，帮助农民学习毛主席著作。经验证明，这对提高农民的社会主义觉悟，加强农村中的政治思想工作，推动三大革命运动，发现和培养新生力量，都起了很好的作用。
    本报讯　山西省各县（市）举办农民讲习所，帮助广大贫农、下中农和其他劳动群众学习毛主席著作，提高革命的自觉性，培养农村三大革命运动中的积极分子和基层组织骨干。
          利用农闲县办队办
    山西各县（市）利用农闲时间举办的农民讲习所，从一九六四年十一月到一九六五年三月底，一般都办了三至四期，共训练学员九万三千九百人。同时，生产大队以县农民讲习所结业的学员为骨干，先后举办了农民讲习所（会）六千八百三十四座，参加讲习所的学员有四十五万七千多人。学员经过农民讲习所（会）的训练，阶级觉悟和社会主义革命自觉性显著提高，干劲倍增。他们回村后，多数发挥了积极的作用，有的被选为干部；同时，由于党支部的领导和他们的带动，全省有成百万农民参加了毛主席著作学习小组，在广大农村形成了一个学习毛主席著作的热潮。
    农民讲习所给学员讲授了毛主席著作里十一篇文章（章节），即：《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《怎样分析农村阶级》、《树立贫农和下中农的优势》、《‘糟得很’和‘好得很’》、《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》、《青年运动的方向》、《继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》此外，还加授了《九评苏共中央的公开信》中关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人五个条件的部分。
          依靠群众挑选学员
    各县农民讲习所是依托党校具体承办的。各县一般都以一位县常委为首，吸收宣传、组织、农村政治工作部门和共青团、妇联、武装部等单位的同志组成领导班子，领导农民讲习所的工作。每期开学，由县委书记或县常委作动员报告，提高学员的学习自觉性。一些县的县委书记参加讲习所的工作，坚持始终。中共永济县委副书记卫得官，一直抓讲习所工作，使永济县农民讲习所办得出色，成为全省一个较好的单位。
    依靠群众，认真挑选学员，是办好农民讲习所的一条很重要的经验。各地都先广泛宣传举办农民讲习所的重要意义和选拔学员的条件，使广大群众认识到办好农民讲习所是关系到培养建设新农村骨干的大事，应当选送贫农、下中农和其他劳动群众中的思想觉悟较高，劳动积极，热爱集体，作风正派的人去学习，由贫农、下中农讨论提出名单，然后报公社和县审查批准。在挑选学员中，各地还组织一定的力量，下去发动群众。左权县农民讲习所共办了四期，每期都组织十几个县干部，由一个县常委带领，先后分别深入到有训练任务的二百零四个生产大队，帮助群众挑选学员。这样，农民讲习所的学员，大部分是农民中涌现出来的积极分子，有强烈的革命要求，他们在学习中积极努力，带着阶级感情、带着问题学习。
          联系实际学好理论
    农民讲习所要组织一个坚强的教学班子，理论联系实际进行教学，搞好教学工作。挑选教员和辅导员既要注意数量，又要特别重视质量。晋南地区各县的四百五十个教员和辅导员，不仅有政治理论水平，而且有实际斗争经验，其中许多人都参加过农村社会主义教育运动。许多教学人员在教学中都能做到边教边下乡调查研究，并和学员同吃同住同学习，又向学员学习。
    各县农民讲习所在教学中把上述十二篇文章（章节），分为阶级和阶级斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争和做好无产阶级革命接班人三个单元进行讲授，结合教学开展了回忆诉苦、参观阶级教育展览、看革命戏、听著名劳动模范的报告、访问革命英雄人物等活动。讲授阶级和阶级斗争时，请老贫农讲家史、村史和社史，组织大家回忆诉苦，参观社会主义教育展览馆。讲社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争时，请老农作了单干和集体化对比的报告等等。讲做好革命接班人时，听绛县南樊公社南柳生产大队党支部书记周明山关于活学活用毛主席思想的录音报告，和昔阳县大寨公社大寨生产大队党支部书记陈永贵艰苦奋斗、自力更生、以国为怀的录音报告，有的还访问了当地革命老英雄，听他们讲革命的事迹。这样，使广大学员通过丰富的实际材料，领会了毛主席的思想，学到了革命的理论。
          加强辅导不断提高
    为了使讲习所回村学员在三大革命运动中更好地锻炼成长，各地农民讲习所开展了所外辅导工作，帮助学员不断提高觉悟。晋南各县把全县分为几个辅导区，在夏秋农民讲习所停办期间，所里工作人员走出校门，下乡帮助回村学员继续学习毛主席著作。芮城县根据学员分布情况，把全县十四个公社划为东、西、中三个辅导区，分别在每个辅导区选一重点，县讲习所组织三个工作组，帮助重点，取得经验，指导全面，先后在全县推广了东?公社曹南生产大队学员组织学习小组等五项经验，促使全县回村学员继续坚持学习毛主席著作。各生产大队的学员都组织起了学习小组，经常进行活动，不断提高思想觉悟。
    去冬以来，根据各地大规模建设稳产高产田的情况，各县农民讲习所除了办一期旨在为大队讲习所培养教学辅导人员的训练班外，县讲习所的全体教员，都分成若干小组，深入到公社的讲学站和大队的讲习所，开展巡回讲学活动。这样就既适应建设稳产高产田的情况，也满足了广大农民群众日益迫切的学习毛主席著作的要求。而且有利于联系实际，改进教学，提高教学质量。（附图片）
