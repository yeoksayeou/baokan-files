    Hsinhua News Agency, January 15th dispatch from Saigon: U.S. bandit aircraft have recently been carrying out frenzied bombing raids on peaceful villages and residential areas in South Vietnam's liberated areas, intensifying the implementation of the inhuman "burn all, kill all, destroy all" policy.

    According to Western news agency reports, on January 14th, the U.S. aggressors dispatched the largest number of aircraft in weeks—511 sorties, including B-52 strategic bombers based in Guam—to savagely bomb the area in a large-scale attack.

    Recently, U.S. bandit aircraft have been carrying out three to four hundred sorties every day, bombing and strafing the South Vietnamese liberated areas. In just four days—the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th—U.S. aircraft carried out a total of 1,589 sorties, destroying 2,280 civilian houses and sinking 78 civilian boats.

    新华社十五日讯　西贡消息：美国强盗飞机最近对南越和平村庄和居民区进行狂轰滥炸，疯狂地加紧实行灭绝人性的“三光”政策。

    最近以来，美国强盗飞机每天都出动三、四百架次，对越南南方解放区进行轰炸扫射。单在五、六、七、九日四天内，美国飞机就共出动了一千五百八十九架次，炸毁民房二千二百八十所，炸沉民船七十八艘。
