    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on December 31st of last year, strongly protesting the savage crimes of American imperialism in intensifying the use of chemical poisons in South Vietnam, massively killing people, and destroying crops.

    The statement said that the U.S. Department of Defense blatantly announced on December 21st of last year that the United States was spreading chemical poisons in South Vietnam and would intensify the use of chemical poisons in 1966.

    The statement said that for four years, the United States has carried out such heinous actions in many areas of South Vietnam. Since the beginning of last year, it has ignored the warnings of progressive humanity and intensified the continuous dispatch of aircraft to spread chemical poisons in the southern provinces.

    The statement pointed out that this action by American imperialism exposed its sinister conspiracy and barbaric nature.

    The statement said that American imperialism, disregarding the protests of the people of the world, is increasingly intensifying the use of chemical poisons in South Vietnam, which is a new provocation to all people who love peace and justice.

    The statement called on the people of the world, especially the American people, to condemn this atrocity by the U.S. authorities and take concrete actions to force it to immediately stop using chemical poisons.

    The statement said that this action by American imperialism cannot shake the patriotic will of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, nor can it force the South Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and surrender to American imperialism. On the contrary, it will further arouse the deep hatred of the entire Vietnamese nation towards the invaders. The South Vietnamese army and people will never forgive the crimes of the American bandits. Together with the 17 million compatriots in the North, they will jointly eliminate the American bandits. No matter how difficult and long the battle, they must crush all the conspiracies and aggressive actions of American imperialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, in the seven days up to December 20th, 30,000 people in Can Tho province, South Vietnam, went to the county towns of Chau Thanh and O Mon respectively to hold demonstrations, demanding that the American aggressors and their lackeys stop spreading chemical poisons and compensate the people for their losses.

    On December 14th and 15th, aircraft of the United States and its puppet clique spread chemical poisons in Chau Thanh and O Mon counties, poisoning thousands of people and destroying more than 10,000 hectares of crops and vegetable gardens. The crimes of the U.S.-puppet clique aroused great anger among the local people. The enemy sent troops to suppress the demonstrators, but many puppet soldiers sympathized with the people's struggle. The fascist acts of the American aggressors and their lackeys also aroused the anger of the citizens of Can Tho province. On December 20th, about 2,000 citizens joined the ranks of their compatriots' struggle.

    The news agency also reported that earlier, on December 7th and 8th, more than 17,000 people in four counties of Binh Dinh province held demonstrations, demanding that the U.S.-puppet troops stop sweeping and shelling their villages and compensate the people for their loss of life and property.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th -- According to the Vietnam News Agency, the head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the Vietnam International Commission on the 4th, protesting the use of poison gas and gas bombs by the American aggressors in the Bao Trai area of Long An province in South Vietnam on January 2nd.

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th -- Saigon News: In order to save themselves from defeat on the battlefield, the American aggressors, ignoring the protests of the Vietnamese people and the strong condemnation of world public opinion, brazenly and extensively used poison gas in South Vietnam.

    According to the Associated Press, chemical warfare officers of the invading U.S. troops admitted that they are "now extensively using CS-type gas in Vietnam." The news said that in addition to dropping gas bombs from airplanes, the U.S. military is now further distributing a type of "gas grenade to ground troops for them to throw by hand or fire with rifles."

    The report also revealed that U.S. officials said that "U.S. Army chemical warfare experts" are looking for "more effective ways" to further "use" poison gas "more extensively."

    声明说，美国国防部去年十二月二十一日明目张胆地宣布，美国正在南越撒放化学毒药，并将在一九六六年加紧使用化学毒药。
    声明说，四年来，美国在南越许多地区进行过这种罪恶的行动，从去年年初以来，它无视进步人类的警告，更加紧不断出动飞机对南方的各省撒放化学毒药。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这种行动，揭穿了它的罪恶阴谋和野蛮的本性。
    声明说，美帝国主义无视世界人民的抗议，日益加紧在南越使用化学毒药，这是对所有热爱和平和正义的人民的新的挑衅。
    声明呼吁全世界人民，特别是美国人民谴责美国当局的这种暴行，并且采取切实的行动迫使它立即停止使用化学毒药。
    声明说，美帝国主义的这种行动动摇不了一千四百万越南南方人民的爱国意志，也不能迫使越南南方人民放下武器，向美帝国主义投降。相反，将更加激起越南全民族对侵略者的深仇大恨。越南南方军民决不会饶恕美国强盗的罪行，他们将同一千七百万北方的骨肉同胞一起，共同消灭美国强盗，不管战斗多么艰苦和长期，一定要粉碎美帝国主义的全部阴谋和侵略行动。
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方芹苴省在到十二月二十日为止的七天里有三万人分别前往周城和乌门两县的县城，举行示威游行，要求美国侵略者及其走狗停止撒放化学毒药，并赔偿人民的损失。
    美国及其傀儡集团的飞机十二月十四日和十五日在周城和乌门两县撒放化学毒药，使数千人中毒，一万多公顷庄稼和菜园被毁坏，美伪集团的罪行激起了当地人民的极大愤怒。敌人派出军队镇压示威者，但是许多伪军都同情人民的斗争。美国侵略者及其走狗的法西斯行径也激起了芹苴省会市民的愤怒。十二月二十日，约有两千市民参加了他们同胞的斗争行列。
    这家通讯社还报道：早些时候，在十二月七日和八日，平定省四个县有一万七千多人举行示威，要求美伪军停止扫荡和炮击他们的村庄，赔偿人民的生命财产损失。

    新华社五日讯　西贡消息：美国侵略者为挽救在战场上的失败，不顾越南人民的抗议和世界舆论的强烈谴责，悍然在越南南方广泛地使用毒气。
    据美联社透露，侵越美军化学战军官承认，他们“现在正在越南广泛使用CS型瓦斯”。消息说，美军除了用飞机投掷毒气弹外，现在还进一步把一种“瓦斯手榴弹发给地面部队，供他们用手投掷或用步枪发射”。
    报道还透露，美国官员说，“美国陆军化学战专家”正在寻找“更有效的办法”，以便进一步“更加广泛地使用”毒气。
