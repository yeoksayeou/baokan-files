    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. The Korean *Rodong Sinmun* published an editorial on the 10th, stating that U.S. President Johnson's so-called "fourteen-point" proposal for a "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnam issue is a huge deception. Its real purpose is to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam under the guise of "peace," in an attempt to salvage the failure it has suffered in South Vietnam.
    The commentary said that Johnson's recent clamoring for "peace talks" is a continuation of the double-dealing tactics consistently used by the Washington authorities in the past. His so-called "fourteen points" and other series of "statements" have nothing new. They are merely a patchwork of deceptive lies that they have repeated ten or a hundred times in the past.
    The commentary said that Johnson's current "fourteen points" still adhere to the robber conditions put forward in the past. They cry "stop thief," proposing that "only when North Vietnam ceases its subversion and aggression against the South," can its invading troops withdraw from South Vietnam.
    The commentary pointed out that this proves that they still attempt to continue to occupy South Vietnam, staying there without leaving, and to legitimize its act of aggression, and have no intention of accepting the four-point proposition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at all.
    The commentary said that another attempt of Johnson's "peace talk" activity is to deceive the people of the world, including the American people, and world public opinion, and to quell the opposition and protests of the people of the world against its acts of aggression.
    The commentary pointed out that while exposing Johnson's conspiracy to further expand the war under the guise of "peace talks," U.S. imperialism has increased its troops invading South Vietnam to nearly 200,000, and is still stepping up the dispatch of troops and the transport of various new types of weapons to South Vietnam.
    The commentary said that the U.S. government recently wants to add an additional $13 billion in huge military appropriations. Is all this mad expansion of war activity for "peace" in Vietnam?
    The commentary said that the root cause of the serious situation in Vietnam lies entirely in the aggression of U.S. imperialism. As long as U.S. imperialism does not stop its aggression against Vietnam and does not withdraw all its aggressive weapons and personnel from South Vietnam, peace will not come.
    The commentary said that the Korean people fully support the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 4th and the statement of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on the 5th, and fully support the position expressed by the Vietnamese people in these two statements.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the Korean people are determined to share life and death with the Vietnamese people, and will do everything possible in any storm to carry the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

    朝鲜《劳动新闻》指出约翰逊十四点主张是欺骗谰言大杂烩
    美军不撤出南越就不会有和平
    新华社平壤十日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》十日发表编辑部评论说，美国总统约翰逊的所谓“和平解决”越南问题的“十四点”主张，是一个大骗局，它的真正目的在于借“和平”的幌子，进一步扩大侵略越南的战争，力图挽回它在越南南方所遭到的失败。
    评论说，约翰逊最近大肆叫嚷的“和平谈判”，是华盛顿当局过去一贯使用的两面手法的继续。他的所谓“十四点”主张和其他一系列“声明”没有任何新的东西，只不过是把它们过去重复了十遍、百遍的欺骗谰言拼凑在一起罢了。
    评论说，约翰逊现在的“十四点”主张仍然坚持过去所提出的强盗条件。它们贼喊捉贼，提出所谓“只有越南北方停止对南方的颠覆和侵略”，它的侵略军队才可能从越南南方撤走。
    评论指出，这证明它们仍然企图继续霸占越南南方，赖在那里不走，并使它的侵略行为合法化，根本不打算接受越南民主共和国的四项主张。
    评论说，约翰逊这次“和谈”活动的另一个企图，是为了欺骗包括美国人民在内的世界人民和世界舆论，平息世界人民对它侵略行为的反对和抗议。
    评论在揭露约翰逊借着“和谈”的幌子进一步扩大战争的阴谋时指出，美帝国主义已把它侵略越南南方的军队增加到近二十万，并且仍然在向越南南方加紧派遣军队和增运各种新型武器。
    评论说，美国政府最近又要追加一百三十亿美元的巨额军事拨款。难道这一切疯狂的扩大战争活动是为了越南的“和平”吗？
    评论说，越南的严重局势的根源完全在于美帝国主义的侵略。只要美帝国主义不停止对越南的侵略、不从越南南方撤走它的一切侵略武器和人员，和平就不会到来。
    评论说，朝鲜人民完全支持越南民主共和国外交部发言人四日声明和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会五日声明，完全支持越南人民在这两个声明中表示的立场。
    评论最后说，朝鲜人民决心同越南人民同生死、共命运，在任何风浪中竭尽一切努力把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争进行到底。
