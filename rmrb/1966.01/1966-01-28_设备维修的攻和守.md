    Equipment Maintenance: Attack and Defense
    Kang Guangyi, Head of Blast Furnace Maintenance Group, Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant

    In the past few years, some people in our workshop always complained that the blast furnace's air volume was too high, the hot blast stove's wind temperature was too high, and the skip hoist's ore carts were running too fast, exhausting the equipment we were responsible for maintaining. Maintenance and repair work always couldn't keep up.

    At that time, there were over three hundred people in our workshop, and we only knew how to guard these "pots and pans" to prevent accidents. When equipment broke down, we repaired it as it was; when spare parts broke down, we replaced them by copying. This kind of passive defensive approach became more and more passive the more we defended. A blast furnace had to be overhauled every three months, and it still wasn't enough.

    Since 1963, we have shifted from defense to offense, actively renovating the blast furnace equipment. As a result, the equipment is in good condition. The number of maintenance personnel has been reduced by half, and the blast furnace overhaul period has been extended from once every three months to once every eleven months. The average repair cost per ton of pig iron produced has also been greatly reduced.

    What was wrong with the previous approach? Just as Chairman Mao said: Passive defense is actually false defense. In the past, we copied blindly, not attacking what should be attacked, not taking an extra step. The more we feared equipment breakdowns, the faster the equipment broke down, truly like "weasels always biting sick ducks." Take the No. 3 blast furnace hot blast valve as an example. One valve weighs more than five tons and costs 10,000 yuan. One breakdown would cause a production halt of more than four hours, reducing production by 200-300 tons of iron. In the past, we replaced them one by one when they broke down, without looking for the cause of the damage or thinking about improvement methods. Break, replace; replace, break. At most, it would last three months; at least, it would only last eight days. In 1960 alone, fourteen valves broke down, costing a large amount in spare parts and reducing production by more than 3,000 tons of pig iron.

    Later, we changed from defense to offense, not letting go of any opportunity to attack. When a hot blast valve broke down and was replaced, everyone would "read its face" to find the cause of the damage, and then conduct a "consultation" to study improvement methods. We found that its design was copied from abroad and was not suitable for high wind temperature and large air volume. So, we used our brains to change the copper cooling water ring of the valve core to a steel structure, change the single-cylinder water passage to a double-cylinder water passage, and improve the filling material, extending its life by more than four times. In 1960, fourteen hot blast valves were replaced in one year. From 1963 to 1965, only sixteen were replaced in three years.

    We have come to realize that passively defending makes people the slaves of equipment, only allowing the equipment to lead people by the nose; actively attacking allows people to become the masters of equipment, and only then can the equipment listen to people.

    设备维修的攻和守
    石钢炼铁厂高炉维修组长　康广义
    头几年，我们车间有些人，总是埋怨高炉的风量加得太大啦，热风炉的风温烧得太高啦，卷扬机的料罐跑得太快啦，把我们负责维修的这些设备累坏了。维护修理工作总是跟不上趟。
    那时候，我们车间有三百多号人，只知道守着这摊“坛坛罐罐”，别出事故。设备坏了照原样儿修好，备件坏了照葫芦画瓢换上。这种消极防守的做法，越守越被动，一座高炉三个月检修一次，还顶不住。
    一九六三年以来，我们转守为攻，积极地对高炉设备进行改造。结果，设备状况很好。维修人员减了一半，高炉由三个月检修一次延长到十一个月检修一次。每生产一吨生铁的平均修理费用，也大大降低了。
    以前的做法错在哪里？正象毛主席说的那样：消极防御实际上是假防御。过去，我们照葫芦画瓢，该攻的不攻，多一步不走，越怕设备坏，设备坏得越快，真是“黄鼠狼单咬病鸭子”。就拿三高炉热风阀门说吧，一个阀门五吨多重，价值一万元，坏一次就得停产四个多小时，减产二、三百吨铁。过去我们是坏一个换一个，不找损坏原因，不想改进办法，坏了换，换了坏，多者用三个月，少者只用八天，一九六○年一年就坏了十四个，花了大量备件费不说，还少产三千多吨生铁。
    以后我们改守为攻，不放松一切进攻的机会。热风阀坏了一换下来，大家就给他“相面”，找损坏原因，然后再进行“会诊”，研究改进方法。我们发现它的设计是抄国外的，不适应高风温、大风量，就开动脑筋，把阀心铸铜冷却水圈改为钢结构，把单筒通水改为双筒通水，又改进了填充材料，使它的寿命延长了四倍多。一九六○年，热风阀一年换了十四个，一九六三年到一九六五年，三年才换了十六个。
    我们体会到，消极地守，人成了设备的奴隶，只能让设备牵着人的鼻子走；积极地攻，人才能成为设备的主人，设备才能听人的话。
