    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 13th - US Seventh Fleet Commander Hyland revealed to reporters in Sasebo on the 12th that the US nuclear-powered fleet directly participating in the Vietnam War hopes to dock at the Japanese naval ports of Sasebo or Yokosuka soon.

    He said, "From the perspective of the equipment available to accommodate large ships, Yokosuka port is better." Hyland arrived in Sasebo on the 12th aboard the Seventh Fleet flagship "Oklahoma City," which will remain there until the 15th.

    According to the Asahi Shimbun on the 13th, the Japanese Sato government has in principle decided to agree to the US nuclear-powered fleet docking in Japan. The Akahata on the 13th pointed out that the United States has in fact turned Sasebo into its nuclear submarine base, and now wants to make Yokosuka the base for the US Seventh Fleet's nuclear-powered fleet. This is a challenge to the Japanese people.

    This US nuclear-powered fleet consists of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and the nuclear-powered destroyer "Bainbridge," among other ships. They were only recently incorporated into the Seventh Fleet. (Image attached)

    侵越美军加紧利用日本军港
    美国核动力舰队将停泊横须贺
    新华社东京十三日电　美国第七舰队司令海兰十二日在佐世保对记者透露，直接参加侵越战争的美国核动力舰队希望最近到日本佐世保或横须贺军港停泊。
    他说，“从接受大型舰艇所具备的设备来看，到横须贺港较好。”海兰是乘第七舰队的旗舰“俄克拉河马城号”在十二日到达佐世保的，这艘旗舰将在那里停留到十五日。
    据《朝日新闻》十三日透露，日本佐藤政府在原则上已经决定同意美国核动力舰队在日本停泊。《赤旗报》十三日指出，美国事实上已经把佐世保变成它的核潜艇基地，现在又想把横须贺作为美国第七舰队的核动力舰队的基地，这是对日本人民的挑战。
