    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 7th—In Xidan Department Store, one of the largest department stores in Beijing, people have noticed many courteous salespersons wearing school badges. They are undergraduates from the Department of Commercial Economics at the Beijing Institute of Commerce, as well as some leading cadres and teachers from the school. University students at the counter, university teachers at the counter, even the department heads and deans of the university at the counter—this has aroused enthusiastic discussion among customers from all walks of life. People praise, "The Institute of Commerce is truly undergoing a great revolution!" "The Institute of Commerce is on the right path!"
    The Department of Commercial Economics at this institute began piloting the work-study program at the beginning of last year. Working at the counter is an important teaching and labor component of their work-study program. Students participate in the most arduous, tiring, and dirty labor in commercial work. The school stipulates that in the first year, students will work at counters in urban retail stores; in the second year, they will participate in receiving, dispatching, packaging, stacking, and carrying goods in wholesale departments; and in the third year, they will go to the countryside to participate in "carrying baskets," peddling goods, herding pigs, and slaughtering pigs, among other tasks of delivering industrial goods to the countryside and mountains, and purchasing agricultural and sideline products. During their four years at the school, students will spend roughly half their time studying and half their time participating in commercial labor. They do this to cultivate students into a new type of worker on the commercial front who are both red and expert, capable of both mental and physical labor, and who can serve as commercial cadres and commercial managers, as well as salespersons, accountants, and purchasing agents after graduation.
    The experience of the Department of Commercial Economics at the Beijing Institute of Commerce in piloting the work-study program for nearly a year vividly demonstrates that the education revolution is first and foremost a revolution in thought. Only under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought can this great education revolution achieve victory.
    At the very beginning of the work-study program, they encountered all sorts of active thoughts. The ideas of looking down on physical labor and commercial work were quite prevalent among students. Influenced by old ideas, many people lacked a correct understanding of socialist commerce and feared participating in commercial labor, fearing hardship, fatigue, and mistreatment, and feeling inferior. Some students came to the Institute of Commerce with a wait-and-see attitude, and upon hearing about the pilot work-study program, they felt even less honorable; a few even considered dropping out. Among teachers, some still blindly believed in books, others feared that if the work-study program was implemented, students' practical knowledge would be enriched, and their own set of theories divorced from reality would become untenable. Still others could not let go of the airs of teachers and intellectuals, fearing participation in commercial labor. As for whether the work-study program could guarantee the quality of teaching, there was even more discussion among teachers and students.
    Faced with this situation, the institute resolutely implemented Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, first organizing teachers and students to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's related works and instructions on education work, as well as the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Liu on the two labor systems and the two education systems, thereby enhancing their ideological understanding and clarifying the direction of this education revolution.
    With a clear direction comes great determination. Thus, the leaders first revolutionized themselves. The president and department heads personally led a team of political cadres and teachers to form a "volunteer" group and went to the department store, putting aside their airs and working at the counter alongside the students and department store employees. Having stood at the counter, the students were educated by the old employees of the department store and enthusiastically encouraged by many workers, peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and revolutionary veteran cadres among the customers. They persisted in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind during labor, received a relatively profound education in the ideology of serving the people, strengthened their class perspective and labor perspective, and gained a clearer understanding of the role of commerce in socialist revolution and construction from their own experience. As a result, the ideas of looking down on commerce were also overcome. The students accelerated their pace on the road to revolutionization and laborization.
    The pilot work-study program not only impacted all kinds of bourgeois ideas but also broke through various frameworks in teaching. There was no ready-made experience regarding what content socialist commercial colleges should teach. Some teaching materials were left over from past bourgeois schools, and some were copied from foreign countries. How these teaching materials should be reformed—whether through patching and mending or through complete revolution—was not clear to some teachers. After standing at the counter, they became more clearly aware that the more than twenty required and elective courses originally prescribed by the Department of Commercial Economics were numerous and complex, with much of the content being outdated, cumbersome, mutually repetitive, and divorced from reality, fundamentally unable to meet the needs of our country's socialist commerce. Therefore, they adopted a thorough revolutionary attitude, broke through the shackles of bourgeois educational thought, eliminated foreign frameworks, and clearly proposed that teaching should be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, "with us as the mainstay," to carry out a thorough revolution, mainly studying Chairman Mao's works and our country's socialist commercial experience, and implementing the principles of close integration of theory with practice and "less but better." Based on these principles, they reformed the teaching, highlighting six major courses: Selected Readings of Chairman Mao's Works, Political Economy, Our Country's Socialist Commercial Policies, Accounting, Commercial Enterprise Management, and Chinese Writing. The number of courses was reduced by two-thirds compared to the past, but the content of the courses was greatly enriched and improved. Teaching methods and teaching systems were also reformed accordingly.
    After the implementation of the work-study program and the teaching reforms, students generally reported that they learned faster, learned more flexibly, and remembered more firmly than in the past. Many teachers, after going to practice to learn and work with a revolutionary attitude, also quickly underwent changes in their mental state.
    The person in charge of the Beijing Institute of Commerce told reporters that, recently, when teachers and students summarized their experiences with the work-study program over the past year, everyone saw the gains in ideology and teaching and strengthened their confidence. However, the pilot work-study program has been in place for a very short time, and many problems still need to be further explored in practice. (Attached picture)

    北京商学院商业经济系试行半工半读
    师生站柜台教学都革命
    他们的经验证明只有毛泽东思想挂帅教育革命才能胜利
    据新华社七日讯　在北京市最大的百货商场之一的西单百货商场里，人们发现许多殷勤服务、胸前挂着校徽的售货员，他们是北京商学院商业经济系半工半读的大学生和这个学校的一些领导干部和教师。大学生站柜台，大学教师站柜台，大学的系主任、院长也站柜台，这引起了各行各业的许多顾客的热烈议论。人们赞扬说：“商学院真是大革命了！”“商学院的路是走对了！”
    这个学院的商业经济系是去年年初开始试行半工半读的，站柜台是他们半工半读的一个重要的教学和劳动环节，商业工作上最苦、最累、最脏的劳动，学生们都要去参加。学校规定：头一年要到城市的零售商店站柜台，第二年要到批发部门参加收货、发货、包装、倒垛、搬运等劳动，第三年到农村去参加“背篓”、挑货郎担子、赶猪、杀猪等等送工业品下乡上山和收购农副产品的工作。学生在校四年期间，学习和参加商业劳动的时间大体上要各占一半。他们这样做，是为了培养学生成为又红又专、能文能武、既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的商业战线的新型劳动者，毕业后既能当商业干部和商业管理人员，又能当售货员、会计员和采购员等。
    北京商学院商业经济系试行半工半读近一年来的情况生动地说明，教育革命首先是一场思想革命。只有毛泽东思想挂帅，才能使这场教育大革命取得胜利。
    试行半工半读一开始，他们就碰到了各种各样的活思想。学生中轻视体力劳动和轻视商业工作的思想相当普遍地存在着，许多人受旧的思想影响，对社会主义商业缺乏正确的认识，怕参加商业劳动吃苦、受累、受气，低人一等。有的学生考上商学院就抱着试试看来的，听说要试行半工半读更觉得不光采，有个别学生甚至想退学。教师中，有的人还迷信书本，有的人怕搞了半工半读，学生的实际知识丰富了，自己那一套脱离实际的理论教不下去了，也有的人放不下教师的架子、知识分子的架子，怕参加商业劳动。至于半工半读能不能保证教学质量的问题，师生中议论就更多了。
    面对着这种情况，这个学院坚决实行毛泽东思想挂帅，首先组织师生认真地学习毛主席有关著作和对教育工作的指示，学习党中央和刘主席关于两种劳动制度、两种教育制度的指示，提高了思想认识，明确了这场教育革命的方向。
    方向明，决心大。于是，领导首先革命，院长、系主任亲自带领一批政治干部和教师组成一个“志愿兵”的班子到商场去，放下架子，同学生、商场职工一起站柜台。站上了柜台，学生们受到商场老职工的教育和顾客中许多工人、农民、解放军战士和革命老干部的热情鼓励，坚持在劳动中带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，受到比较深刻的为人民服务的思想教育，阶级观点和劳动观点增强了，并且从亲身体会中，对商业在社会主义革命和建设中的作用认识更清楚了，因此轻视商业的思想也有所克服。学生们在革命化、劳动化的道路上加快了步伐。
    试行半工半读，不仅使形形色色的资产阶级思想受到了冲击，也冲破了教学上的各种框框。社会主义的商业高等学校应该教些什么内容，没有现成的经验，有些教材是过去资产阶级学校留下来的，有的是从外国搬来的。这些教材应该怎样改革，是修修补补，还是彻底革命，有些教师并不清楚。站上柜台后，他们才更清楚地看到原来商业经济系规定必修和选修的二十多门课，多而杂，许多内容陈旧、烦琐，相互重复，脱离实际，根本不能适应我国社会主义商业的需要。因此他们采取彻底革命的态度，冲破资产阶级教育思想影响的束缚，破除洋框框，明确地提出了在教学上要以毛泽东思想挂帅，“以我为主”来进行彻底革命，主要学习毛主席著作和我国社会主义商业的经验，并贯彻理论密切联系实际和“少而精”的原则。他们根据这些原则对教学进行改革后，突出了毛主席著作选读、政治经济学、我国社会主义商业政策、会计学、商业企业管理和汉语写作六大门课。课程门类比过去减少了三分之二，课程内容却大大丰富和提高了。教学方法、教学制度也随之改革了。
    在试行半工半读和进行教学改革后，学生们普遍反映比过去学得快，学得活，记得牢了。许多教师以革命的态度到实践中去学、去干之后，精神状态也很快地起了变化。
    北京商学院的负责人对记者说，最近师生们在总结近一年来半工半读的经验时，大家看到了思想上和教学上的收获，增强了信心。但目前试行半工半读时间还很短，许多问题还有待于在实践中进一步探索。（附图片）
