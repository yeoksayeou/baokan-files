    How to Give Prominence to Politics?
    In Daqing, political work is omnipresent, starting from political and ideological work in everything at all times.
    Editor's Note: How to give prominence to politics in enterprises is a question of great concern to many comrades. The article "How to Give Prominence to Politics?" published in this newspaper today introduces the political work of Daqing from various aspects. The Daqing Oilfield Party Committee puts political work first on the agenda, and leading cadres in charge of administration and technology also give priority to political and ideological work, and the families are also concerned about politics. In short, in Daqing Oilfield, political work is omnipresent, and everything starts with political and ideological work. This is the fundamental reason for their continuous and great achievements. To give prominence to politics is to do the work of people, to solve people's ideological problems, and to raise people's class consciousness. The example of group leader Shi Shimin helping Wang Qingfang to make progress vividly illustrates that in order to truly solve problems, it is not enough to merely care about the lives of the masses and solve some specific problems, but it is necessary to fundamentally solve ideological problems. To give prominence to politics is to do the work of people and conduct class education. What weapon should be used to do the work of people? Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon to raise the consciousness of the masses and solve ideological problems. Arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Create an atmosphere among the masses of reading, speaking, and applying Chairman Mao's works, and when encountering problems, first talk about Chairman Mao's works, and truly use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. This is the basic experience of Daqing in highlighting politics.
    The Position of Politics
    Before coming to Daqing, I often heard a saying: "Politics is a soft task, and production is a hard task." "Compared with production and politics, is politics more important? Or is production more important?"
    This issue no longer exists in Daqing. The relationship between politics and production is not a matter of hard tasks or soft tasks, nor is it a matter of who is important and who is not, but rather that without politics, there is no socialist production. Comrade Wei Guangrong, a driller in a drilling team, vividly summarized his experience and lessons learned. He said: "Only focusing on the drill bit without focusing on the people's heads leads to suffering; focusing on the people's heads and then focusing on the drill bit leads to success." The "people's heads" he mentioned refer to the political work in people's minds.
    Daqing handles the relationship between politics and production in its daily work in this way: grasping production starts with politics, and grasping politics starts from production. To talk about leadership, one cannot simply talk about "administrative leadership" or "technical leadership"; the leadership we talk about is first and foremost political leadership. Without political leadership, it is actually not administrative leadership or technical leadership. Political workers should have a division of labor with administrative workers and technical workers, but the division of labor is not a "separation of families." If the result of the division of labor is the creation of "pragmatists who lose their direction" or "armchair politicians," then that would be very bad. The departments and staff in charge of administration and technology must be familiar with the political situation and be able to do ideological and political work; the departments and staff in charge of political work must also be familiar with production and promote production work.
    We once asked a comrade from the Daqing Party Committee: "How many days does the Party Committee discuss political work in a month?"
    Unexpectedly, this question embarrassed the other party. He thought for a while and then said: "It can also be said that every time we hold a meeting, we are discussing political work. No matter what work we are arranging, we first study its political significance, study how to raise the political consciousness of the masses, and let the masses consciously and willingly complete this work." The Daqing Party Committee always puts ideological and political work in the first place, rather than simply pushing it to the political departments to do.
    The Party Committee grasps political work, and administrative and technical leaders also grasp political work. A non-Party chief engineer said: "In the past, the first thing I did when I went down was to grasp production; the second was to grasp data; and the third was to grasp drawings. After coming to Daqing, the first thing was to grasp ideological and political work, the second was to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works; and the third was to grasp style. Then, I grasped the problems of technical work. This way of grasping gradually led to a high standard of technical level."
    Closely Follow Mao Zedong Thought
    In Daqing, more than 90% of the workers and staff can often study Chairman Mao's works, and the families of workers and staff also pay attention to studying Chairman Mao's works. Among the workers and staff, it is common to read, speak, and apply Chairman Mao's works. Everyone takes class struggle as the key link, promotes proletarian ideology, and eliminates bourgeois ideology. Mao Zedong Thought commands everything. This is the fundamental sign of highlighting politics.
    Here, people often say: "We must follow Mao Zedong Thought, follow the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao," and we must "follow closely, follow quickly, follow accurately, and follow well." As soon as the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have any instructions, they immediately carry out in-depth study and discussion. After studying and discussing, they immediately put them into action. In the process of action, they continue to study and discuss. There is also the so-called "nine heats and one cold" saying, which means that after a period of intense work (not necessarily nine days), one must calm down and use Mao Zedong Thought to summarize the work. They believe that only in this way can they "follow accurately and follow well."
    Daqing is extremely serious in learning from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army. They believe that the People's Liberation Army follows Mao Zedong Thought, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao most closely, quickly, accurately, and well. This is precisely the commonality between the People's Liberation Army and Daqing Oilfield. This commonality is major, fundamental, and abundant. Starting from this point to learn the specific political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, they feel close and can use it flexibly. After learning from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, they further deeply rooted Mao Zedong Thought in people's minds, systems, and organizations.
    In the study of Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses have adopted many good experiences and good methods. For example: "Study with questions in mind, have a hook in your heart, be able to hang on, understand, remember firmly, and apply." "Don't go out if you have nothing to do, and take a book with you when you go out." "The earth is the study, read a few lines when you have time." "Quotations are good, easy to understand, remember firmly, take little time, and are effective quickly." Once these words are spoken, they spread like wildfire, forming a strong political atmosphere of mutual inspiration and mutual promotion.
    The Politics of the Masses
    Most people do political work, not a few people do political work, so that politics can be prominent.
    Chairman Mao said: Our politics is "the politics of the masses." The Daqing leading organs once reminded cadres to pay attention to solving the problem of "whether we rely on the masses or manage the masses." The fact that most people in Daqing consciously do political work is precisely the result of relying on the masses rather than managing the masses.
    Some comrades from other places came to Daqing to investigate political work, and did not first talk to the workers, but first went to see the families. Because this is an aspect of political work in enterprises that is most easily overlooked.
    Now, all the family members in Daqing who have the ability to work have participated in agricultural and sideline production and other labor. More than 90% of the dormitories were built by the families themselves. Families are an important part of Daqing people.
    What most attracted the attention of the comrades was that the family members studied Chairman Mao's works so seriously and were so concerned about politics. The families regard labor as doing revolution, which shows that political work has truly reached the home. Many comrades believe that Daqing women are no longer ordinary housewives, but women who have been thoroughly liberated in thought and labor. These visiting comrades excitedly told us one vivid example after another.
    A family member of a worker became a labor model for herding cattle for the collective. She had never herded cattle before and was scared when she first saw them. Later, she studied Chairman Mao's works, improved her thinking, and regarded herding cattle as her task of doing revolution. She studied diligently and practiced hard, and one person could herd more than fifty head of cattle. Herding cattle requires getting up early, but combing her hair took time, so she decided to cut it off. Her husband disagreed, saying that cutting her braids would make her "neither male nor female." She reasoned with her husband politically, but her husband still disagreed. One day, she cut off her braids herself. Her husband was very angry. The nearby family members heard that they were having a quarrel over this matter and came to do political work to get through the man's thinking. The family cadre told the husband that his wife was a labor model and a pace-setter, and she was worthy of learning from. Why was he quarreling with her over this small matter? The man was educated. The next day, he told his wife when he went to work: "See you at the end of the year, I will definitely become a 'Five-Good' worker to see you."
    In the past, when family members met, they often commented on each other and compared eating and dressing; now everyone is making revolution and comparing contributions to the country. In the past, workers were "the class is a wind of the East, and the family is a wind of the West," but now they are male workers and female farmers, studying together and advancing hand in hand. The workers said: "We not only have no worries, but also have relatives who urge us to progress every day!"
    Do Not Relax on Small Matters and Details
    Only by highlighting politics at all times and in all things can politics be prominent.
    The comrades in Daqing believe that it is certainly necessary to highlight politics in the production upsurge, but it is equally necessary to highlight politics in the large amount of daily, specific, and minor work.
    A screw falling off a machine or a missing unimportant "dot" on a drawing may be regarded as a trivial matter, but in Daqing, it is often regarded as a major event that cannot be relaxed. They look at problems from a political perspective and from an ideological perspective, believing that this is a loss of revolutionary style, a loss of revolutionary tradition, and a loss of revolutionary sense of responsibility, so they must conduct inspections from the ideological and political perspective until they find out the lessons learned - of course, this is only to accept the lessons learned. It is precisely because people are repeatedly reminded by this kind of lesson that they gradually realize the necessity of highlighting politics at all times and in all things. Su Shunguo, a driver of the 1205 drilling team, said well: "I used to never take 'small things' to heart, thinking that how could I not be negligent in my work? Now I realize that things are done by people, as long as we have a highly responsible ideology in our work, there will be no problems."
    In Daqing, you can hear stories like this almost everywhere:
    There was a female comrade named Wang Qingfang who was often late for meetings and sometimes lacked concentration at work. The comrades in the group learned that she was the mother of two children and had to do all the housework herself. When there were too many things to do and the children were noisy, she could not muster the energy to do her job. They enthusiastically helped her reduce her household burden, and she became active. However, after a period of time, her work enthusiasm declined again. After learning about it, it turned out that her dormitory had poor heating equipment and the house was cold. After finishing his shift in the middle of the night, group leader Shi Shimin picked up firewood for her, and everyone sent hot food to her home. In this way, she became active again. These two changes of hers made the group leader think: Why does she feel down whenever she encounters a specific problem? Can the current progress be consolidated? He studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind and found the answer: To help a comrade make progress, it is not enough to solve specific problems, only by fundamentally raising her class consciousness and helping her establish a proletarian revolutionary worldview can she always maintain a strong revolutionary spirit and withstand the test of any difficulties. Therefore, the group leader studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with her and helped her understand the noble communist spirit of Norman Bethune, who was selfless and dedicated to others. In this way, she gradually solved the correct relationship between work and housework, did her work persistently and unremittingly, arranged her housework in an orderly manner, and could also help other comrades.
    People do not relax on small matters and details, also because big things often develop from small matters and details. If you have training in ordinary times, you will be able to pass the test in the emergency situation of the production upsurge. There is an important saying here: The production upsurge must be an upsurge of highlighting politics, and it must be an upsurge of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. The more in-depth and developed the production upsurge, the more acute and complex the ideological struggle, and the more various ideological problems will come out to perform, so the more necessary it is to highlight politics.
    Repeated Struggle
    To highlight politics, it is necessary to fight against the old habit of neglecting politics. In Daqing, this struggle has continued unabated. Daqing has conducted many repeated struggles from the first day of the campaign to the present, and it seems that they are prepared to continue this struggle.
    There was a captain whose team had not been able to improve its work for five years, always following "behind the buttocks" of other teams. In November 1963, there were five accidents. The first time, his conclusion was "the post responsibility system is not strict"; the second time, he thought it was "not enough criticism of workers in normal times"; the third time, he said it was "the well chief and technicians did not check strictly"; the fourth time, he blamed the workers for "poor technical skills"; the fifth time, he said it was "caused by workers carrying out technical innovations" and announced that "technical innovations are not allowed during working hours." Five "bitter experiences" did not educate him; repeated criticisms from leading comrades, instructors, and worker comrades were also unable to move him. He said to the leading comrades: "Please understand us, there are too many things at the grassroots level!" He also said to the Party branch committee member (worker) who gave him advice: "You said to do ideological work, and I agree; but if our 'scraper' falls into the oil well, can you use ideological work to fish it out for me!" It was not until the recent socialist education movement that he slowly figured it out. The workers made a request to him, saying: "We hope you will lead us with Mao Zedong Thought!" These words had a great impact on him. He said: "I have participated in the revolution for twenty-one years, and I still don't know how to make a revolution. Not knowing how to make a revolution is manifested in not studying Chairman Mao's works well and not putting ideological and political work in the first place." From then on, he understood that highlighting politics can not only enable everyone to handle accidents quickly and well, but also prevent accidents and eliminate accidents.
    Such examples show that the tendency to neglect politics has both class roots and cognitive roots. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct repeated struggles, and there is no one-and-for-all solution. Some places have not conducted this kind of struggle, but rashly declared that they have highlighted politics, which is only because they have not highlighted politics.
    At this moment, Daqing is conducting a "winter political rectification" and socialist education movement. They comprehensively check the situation of highlighting politics. All comrades are using the weapons of praise and criticism to highlight politics by evaluating "Five-Good" workers and Five-Good units, and are fighting against the tendency to neglect politics, widely praising people and things that highlight politics, and criticizing people and things that neglect politics. There is no doubt that after this inspection, Daqing will further highlight politics.

### 怎样突出政治？  在大庆，政治工作无所不在，时时事事从政治思想工作入手

专栏：

    怎样突出政治？
    在大庆，政治工作无所不在，时时事事从政治思想工作入手
    编者按：怎样在企业里突出政治，是很多同志十分关心的一个问题。本报今天登载的《怎样突出政治？》一文，从各个侧面，介绍了大庆的政治工作。大庆油田党委把政治工作放在议事日程的第一位，主管行政、技术的领导干部也是首先抓政治思想工作，家属也很关心政治。总之，在大庆油田，政治工作无所不在，时时事事从政治思想工作入手。这是他们不断取得巨大成绩的根本原因。突出政治，就是做人的工作，解决人们的思想问题，提高人们的阶级觉悟。组长时士敏帮助王清芳进步的事例，生动地说明了，要想真正解决问题，仅仅关心群众生活，解决一些具体问题，是很不够的，而必须从根本上解决思想问题。突出政治，就要做人的工作，进行阶级教育。用什么武器去做人的工作呢？毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是提高群众觉悟，解决思想问题的最有力的武器。用毛泽东思想把群众武装起来。在群众中造成读、讲、用毛主席著作的风气，遇到问题，先讲毛主席的著作，真正用毛泽东思想统帅一切。这是大庆突出政治的基本经验。
    政治的位置
    来大庆之前，经常听到过一种说法：“政治是软任务，生产是硬任务。” “生产和政治比，是政治重要？还是生产重要？”
    大庆早已不存在这个问题。政治和生产的关系问题，不是什么硬任务、软任务的问题，也不是谁重要、谁不重要的问题，而是没有政治，就没有社会主义生产的问题。一位钻井队司钻魏光荣同志把他的经验和教训作了生动的概括。他说：“光抓钻头，不抓人头，吃了苦头；抓了人头，再抓钻头，尝到甜头。”他所说的“人头”，就是做人的头脑里的政治工作。
    大庆在日常工作中是这样处理政治和生产的关系的：抓生产从政治入手，抓政治从生产出发。要谈领导，就不能单纯地谈什么“行政领导”，“技术领导”；我们说的领导，首先就是政治领导。离开政治领导，实际上也就不成为行政领导或技术领导。政治工作者同行政工作者、技术工作者要有分工，但是，分工不是“分家”。如果分工的结果，分出了“迷失方向的实际家”或“空头政治家”，那就很不好了。主管行政、技术的部门和工作人员必须熟悉政治形势，会做思想政治工作；主管政治工作的部门和工作人员也必须熟悉生产，推动生产工作。
    我们曾经问过大庆党委同志：“党委会多少日子讨论一次政治工作？”
    想不到，这个问题竟使对方感到为难。他想了一会儿，才说道：“也可以说，我们每次开会，都是讨论政治工作。我们不管布置什么工作，都是首先研究它的政治意义，研究怎样提高群众的政治觉悟，由群众自觉自愿地完成这个工作。”大庆党委会总是把政治思想工作放在第一位，而不是仅仅推给政治部门去做。
    党委抓政治工作，行政、技术领导也抓政治工作。有一位非党的总工程师说：“过去我下去第一是抓生产；第二是抓数据；第三是抓图纸。到大庆以后，首先是抓政治思想，第二是抓学习毛主席著作的情况；第三是抓作风。然后，才抓技术工作的问题。这样抓法，逐渐就出现了高标准的技术水平。”
    紧跟毛泽东思想
    在大庆，百分之九十以上的职工都能经常学习毛主席著作，职工家属也注意学习毛主席著作。在职工群众中，读、讲、用毛主席著作成风。大家以阶级斗争为纲，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想。毛泽东思想统帅一切。这是突出政治的根本标志。
    这里，人们常说：“要跟毛泽东思想、跟党中央和毛主席”，而且要“跟得紧，跟得快，跟得准，跟得好。”党中央、毛主席有什么指示，马上就进行深入的学习和讨论，学习了，讨论了，立即见诸行动。在行动过程中，继续学习和讨论。这里还有所谓“九热一冷”的说法，意思是在热热烈烈地干一段工作（也不一定是九天）之后，就要冷静一下，运用毛泽东思想把工作总结一下。他们认为，只有这样，才能“跟得准，跟得好”。
    大庆学习解放军的政治工作经验极其认真。他们认为，解放军跟毛泽东思想，跟党中央和毛主席最紧、最快、最准、最好。这正是解放军和大庆油田的共性。这种共性，是主要的、基本的、大量的。从这一点出发去学解放军的具体的政治工作经验，就感到亲切了，就能用得活了。学习解放军的政治工作经验后，进一步使毛泽东思想在人的思想上、制度上、组织上深深扎根。
    在学习毛主席的著作中，广大群众采用了许多好经验、好方法。如：“带着问题学，心里有了钩，挂得住，学得懂，记得牢，用得上。”“没事不出门，出门书跟人”。“大地当书房，有空读几行。”“语录好，容易懂，记得牢，费时少，见效快。”这些话，一经出口，不胫而走，形成互相启发、互相促进的浓厚的政治空气。
    群众的政治
    多数人做政治工作，而不是少数人做政治工作，这样，政治才能突出。
    毛主席说：我们的政治是“群众的政治”。大庆领导机关曾经提醒干部注意解决“我们到底是靠群众，还是管群众”的问题。大庆多数人自觉地做政治工作，正是靠群众而不是管群众的结果。
    一些外地同志到大庆考察政治工作，不是先找职工谈，而是先去看家属。因为，这是企业中政治工作最容易被忽略的一个方面。
    现在，大庆一切有劳动能力的家属都已经参加了农副业生产和其他劳动。百分之九十以上的宿舍是家属动手盖起来的。家属是大庆人的一个重要的组成部分。
    最引起同志们注意的是家属们那么认真地学毛主席著作，那么关心政治。家属把劳动当作革命干，这表明政治工作真正做到了家。许多同志认为，大庆妇女不再是一般的家庭妇女，而是在思想上和劳动中彻底解放了的妇女。这些来访的同志兴高采烈地向我们讲了一个又一个的生动例子。
    有一位职工家属，为集体放牛，成了劳动模范。她从来没有放过牛，开始见了还害怕。后来学习毛主席著作，提高了思想，把放牛看作是自己干革命的任务，勤学苦练，一个人可以放五十多头。放牛要起早，可是梳辫子耽误时间，决心把它剪掉。丈夫不同意，说是剪了辫子“男不男，女不女”。她从政治上跟丈夫讲道理，丈夫还是不同意。一天，她自己把辫子剪掉了。丈夫大为生气。附近的家属听说他们为这件事情闹了别扭，都来做政治工作，打通男方的思想；家属干部告诉这位丈夫，他的妻子是劳动模范、标兵，是值得学习的人，为什么因这件小事跟她闹别扭呢？男的受到教育。第二天上工时告诉妻子说：“咱们年底见，我一定当上‘五好’工人来见你。”
    家属们过去碰到一起，常常评头论足，比吃比穿；现在大家闹革命，比对国家的贡献。过去职工是“班上刮东风，家里刮西风”，现在却是男工女农，共同学习，携手并进了。工人说：“我们不但没有后顾之忧，而且有天天督促自己进步的亲人了！”不放松小事细事
    时时事事突出政治，政治才能突出。
    大庆的同志认为，在生产高潮中，固然要突出政治，在大量的、日常的、具体的、细小的工作中，同样要突出政治。
    机器上掉了一个螺丝钉，图纸上漏了一个不重要的“点”，也许可以看作是一件小事，可是，在大庆，却经常被当做不能放松的大事。他们从政治上看问题，从思想上看问题，认为这是丢了革命作风，丢了革命传统，丢了革命责任心的问题，所以要从思想政治的角度进行检查，直找出教训为止——当然，这仅仅是为了接受教训。正因为人们一再被这种教训所提醒，才逐步认识到时时事事突出政治的必要。一二○五钻井队司机苏顺国说得好：“我以前对‘小事’从不放在心上，认为干工作哪有不疏忽一下的？现在认识到事在人为，只要我们在工作中有高度负责的思想，就不会出问题。”
    在大庆，几乎到处都可以听到这样一类的故事：
    有一个叫王清芳的女同志，开会常迟到，工作上有时精力不集中。组里的同志了解到，她是两个孩子的妈妈，家务事都要自己干。事一多，孩子一闹，就提不起精神来干工作。他们热情地帮助她减轻了家务负担，她就积极起来了。可是，过了一个时期，她的工作劲头又下降了。一了解，原来她的宿舍取暖设备差，房子冷。组长时士敏半夜下班后给她拣柴禾，大家把热菜热饭送到她家里。这样，她又积极起来了。她这两次转变，使组长不能不想到：她为什么一碰到具体问题，情绪就低落呢，现在的进步能巩固吗？带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，从中找到了答案：要帮助一个同志进步，光解决具体问题还是不够的，只有从根本上提高阶级觉悟，帮助她树立无产阶级革命世界观，才能使她永远保持旺盛的革命干劲，经得起任何困难的考验。于是，组长就和她一起学习《纪念白求恩》，帮助她认识白求恩毫不利己、专门利人的高尚的共产主义精神。这样，她逐渐地解决了工作和家务事的正确关系，持久不懈地作好了工作，把家务事安排得有条有理，而且还能帮助别的同志。
    人们不放松小事细事，还因为大事常常是小事细事发展来的。平常有了锻炼，到生产高潮的紧急情况下，就过得硬了。这里有一个重要的提法：生产高潮必须是突出政治的高潮，必须是活学活用毛泽东思想的高潮。生产高潮越深入、越发展，思想斗争就越尖锐、越复杂，形形色色的思想问题就越要出来表演，因此就越要突出政治。反　复　的　斗　争
    要突出政治，就要同忽视政治的老习惯作斗争。在大庆，这种斗争一直持续不断。大庆从会战第一天起到现在，已经反复进行了许多次，看来这种斗争，他们还准备继续进行下去。
    有这样一个队长，他领导的队，五年来工作一直上不去，总跟着别队的“屁股后转”。一九六三年十一月曾发生五次事故，第一次，他的结论是“岗位责任制不严”；第二次，他认为是“平常对工人批评得不够”；第三次，他又说是“井长、技术员检查不严”；第四次，他责备工人“技术不过硬”；第五次，他说是“工人搞技术革新造成的”，宣布以后“不许在工作时间搞技术革新”。五次“苦头”没有把他教育过来；领导同志、指导员、工人同志的多次批评，也没有能打动他。他向领导同志说：“你体谅体谅我们吧，基层的事情太多了！”又向给他提意见的党支部委员（工人）说：“你说做思想工作，我也同意；可是，我们的‘刮腊片’掉到油井里了，你用思想工作给我捞上来吧！”直到最近的社会主义教育运动中，他才慢慢想通了。工人向他提出要求说：“希望你用毛泽东思想带我们！”这话对他震动很大。他说：“我参加革命二十一年了，还不会革命。不会革命，就表现在不好好学习毛主席著作、不把思想政治工作放在第一位。”从此，他才懂得，突出政治不仅可以使大家又快又好地处理事故，而且可以防止事故、消灭事故。
    这样的例子说明，忽视政治的倾向，既有阶级根源，也有认识根源。因此，必须反复地进行斗争，一劳永逸的办法是没有的。有的地方没有进行这种斗争，却轻率地宣布已经突出了政治，这只不过是因为没有突出政治而已。
    此刻，大庆正在进行“冬季政治整训”和社会主义教育运动。他们全面地检查突出政治的情况。全体同志正用表扬和批评的武器，通过评选“五好”职工和五好单位，突出政治，并且对忽视政治的倾向作斗争，广泛地表扬突出政治的人和事，批评忽视政治的人和事。毫无疑问，经过这次检查，大庆必将更进一步地突出政治。
