    New China News Agency, Hanoi, 12th—The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency recently published a commentary saying that the great victory achieved by the military and civilians of Long An Province (i.e., the Xin An-Di An area) at the beginning of this year in repelling the large-scale "mopping-up" operations by the US-puppet army and the Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops is "a powerful answer from our military and civilians to Johnson and his running dogs playing deceptive tricks such as 'unconditional discussions' and 'seeking peace.' This great victory makes them understand that the Vietnamese military and civilians will never be fooled by US imperialism at any time, and will never harbor any illusions about the American aggressor wolves at any time."

    The commentary said, "Our military and civilians are determined to continue fighting until there is not a single shadow of an American aggressor on our beloved land."

    In this anti-"mopping-up" struggle, the military and civilians of Long An Province annihilated more than 700 enemies, including 500 US aggressor troops and Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops.

    The commentary said that this great victory of the military and civilians of Long An Province is a heavy blow to US imperialism's conspiracy to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam, and lets it know that sending more troops to South Vietnam will only send more people to their deaths. It can never escape its shameful fate of defeat. The commentary pointed out that this victory shows that the guerrillas and local troops in Long An Province are not only capable of annihilating enemy troops by entire companies and battalions, but also capable of defeating the "mopping-up" operations of large enemy regiments of US-puppet and vassal troops over many days, depleting and eliminating much of the enemy's strength, and defending and expanding the liberated areas.

    The commentary said that Long An Province is one of the most outstanding provinces in South Vietnam in thwarting the enemy's "key pacification" plan. In January, June, September, and October of last year alone, the military and civilians of this province completely annihilated the Third Battalion of the 49th Regiment of the 25th Division of the puppet army and the 52nd, 33rd, and 51st Ranger Battalions in De Hoa, De Lap, and other counties. Recently, Long An Province was awarded the first-class Bronze Wall Medal by the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

    New China News Agency, 12th—Saigon News: In Da Nang, heavily defended by US Marines, and in Saigon, the center of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, as well as in many other places in South Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces continue to strike the enemy and have achieved new victories.

    According to Western news agencies, the People's Armed Forces cleverly used landmines to blow up an American military club in Da Nang on the evening of the 11th, and safely withdrew after completing the mission. According to preliminary reports, three American aggressors were injured on the spot.

    Western news agencies admitted that this bombing incident shows that the People's Armed Forces have the ability to surprise and attack "heavily fortified areas" of the US-puppets.

    On the same day, the People's Armed Forces shelled an enemy stronghold on the banks of the Saigon River, only six kilometers southeast of Saigon. This stronghold is only three kilometers away from the US-puppet's largest Nha Be oil storage area. The people's armed forces also attacked a bridge on the outskirts of Di An near Saigon.

    In Quang Ngai Province, the People's Armed Forces captured an important enemy stronghold on the outskirts of Quang Ngai City, in the Tra Khuc River valley passage, on the 11th. This is the fifth stronghold on the outskirts of Quang Ngai City that the People's Armed Forces have captured since mid-December of last year.

    Near Pleiku in the Central Highlands, the People's Armed Forces hit an American C-130 transport plane loaded with ammunition on the 7th. According to reports, when the plane barely flew back to the airport and taxied onto the runway, there were two explosions, and five American aggressors on board were killed.

    南越解放通讯社说隆安省反“扫荡”胜利是对“和平”骗局的有力回答
   越南军民决不上当决不对美帝抱任何幻想
   南越人民武装力量在岘港和西贡波来古等地不断打击敌人
    新华社河内十二日电　越南南方解放通讯社最近发表评论说，隆安省（即新安—堤岸地区）军民今年年初在反击美伪军和澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军的大规模“扫荡”中所取得的巨大胜利是“我们军民对约翰逊及其走狗玩弄‘无条件讨论’、‘谋求和平’等欺骗花招的有力回答。这次大捷使他们懂得，越南军民任何时候也不会上美帝国主义的当，任何时候也不会对美国侵略豺狼抱任何幻想”。
    评论说，“我们军民决心继续打下去，一直打到在我们亲爱的国土上没有一个美国侵略者的魔影为止。”
    在这次反“扫荡”斗争中，隆安省军民共歼敌七百多名，其中包括美国侵略军和澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军五百名。
    评论说，隆安省军民的这次巨大胜利是对美帝国主义企图强化侵越战争阴谋的一个沉重打击，并且让它知道：它派遣更多的军队到越南南方来，只不过是让更多的人来送死。它绝对不可能摆脱可耻的失败命运。评论指出，这次胜利表明，隆安省游击队和地方部队不仅能够整连、整营地全歼敌军，而且还能够击溃美伪军和仆从军大战团的多天“扫荡”，消耗、消灭敌人许多有生力量，保卫和扩大解放区。
    评论说，隆安省是越南南方挫败敌人“重点绥靖”计划最出色的省份之一。仅在去年一月、六月、九月和十月，这个省的军民在德和、德立等县就先后全歼伪军第二十五师第四十九团的第三营和第五十二、第三十三、第五十一别动营。最近隆安省获得了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会授予的一级铜墙勋章。
    新华社十二日讯　西贡消息：在美国海军陆战队重兵防守的岘港和南越傀儡政权统治的中心西贡以及越南南方的其它许多地方，人民武装力量继续不断地打击敌人，取得了新的战果。
    据西方通讯社报道，人民武装力量十一日晚巧妙地用地雷爆炸了岘港市内的一所美国军人俱乐部，任务完成后，安全转移。据初步消息，三名美国侵略者当场被炸伤。
    西方通讯社承认，这次爆炸事件表明，人民武装力量有能力奇袭美伪“重兵集结的地区”。
    在同一天，人民武装力量炮轰了距西贡东南仅仅六公里，在西贡河岸上的一个敌军据点。这个据点离美伪最大的芽?贮油区只有三公里远。人民武装还进攻了西贡附近堤岸市郊的一座桥梁。
    在广义省，人民武装力量十一日攻克了广义市外围、茶曲河谷通道上的一个敌军重要据点。这是从去年十二月中旬以来人民武装力量攻下的第五个广义市外围据点。
    在中部高原的波来古附近，人民武装力量七日击中了一架满载弹药的美国C—130型运输机。据报道，当这架飞机勉强飞回机场驶向跑道时，发生了两次爆炸，机上的五名美国侵略军丧命。
