    Foreword Disagrees with Afterword
    The *Wall Street Journal* commented on Johnson's budget message, saying, "It might be a bit unfair to call the new budget hypocritical."
    However, this newspaper exposed many of the deceptive tactics in Johnson's new budget one by one, for example: "The budget strains the meaning of some basic figures to the point of being almost irrelevant," "The deceptive techniques are particularly obvious in income estimates," and so on.
    "Strains to the point of being almost irrelevant," "deceptive," isn't this utter hypocrisy? In that case, isn't the *Wall Street Journal* itself being "a bit unfair"?

    前言不对后语
    《华尔街日报》评论约翰逊的预算咨文说：“如果称新预算是伪善的，那也许有点不公正。”
    可是，这家报纸却把约翰逊的新预算中的许多骗人手法一一加以揭露，例如：“预算把一些基本数字的含义牵强得几乎不着边际了”，“弄虚作假的手法在收入估计方面特别明显”等等。
    “牵强得几乎不着边际”，“弄虚作假”，这不是十足的伪善是什么？这样说来，《华尔街日报》自己不是也“有点不公正”了吗？
