    Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: In agricultural and sideline production, the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army adhere to highlighting politics, using revolutionary spirit to overcome various natural disasters, and achieved large-scale bumper harvests of grain and vegetables again in 1965.

    At the beginning of last year, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on highlighting politics, the various units regarded political and ideological preparation as the most important preparation for completing the year's production tasks. The broad masses of commanders and fighters, linking with the domestic and international class struggle situations, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On the Importance of Army Production for Self-Support and of Launching the Two Great Movements of Rectification and Production," "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," further recognized the great significance of the army's participation in agricultural and sideline production, and clearly established the idea of ​​farming for the revolution and producing for war preparedness. The soldiers said: Producing one more grain of food is one more contribution to the Chinese people and to the world revolution. In each production season, the various units attached importance to using politics to command production and implementing political work into the production struggle. The busier the production tasks, the tighter the political and ideological work was grasped. The Red Flag Farm of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region had poor natural conditions, with many winds, much water, much grass, many insects, and alkaline soil. Some people lacked confidence in winning a bumper harvest. This unit started by grasping living ideas, organizing the broad masses of commanders and fighters to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's discussions on hard struggle, making everyone realize that in the relationship between land and people, the human factor is the most important, and boosted the commanders' and fighters' ambition to march towards nature. They braved wind and snow, built water conservancy projects, accumulated large amounts of fertilizer, and improved the soil; in the hot summer days, they also braved the scorching sun to kill insects and remove weeds. The soldiers firmly said: The people of Daqing hold the blue sky above their heads and have conquered the great oilfield for the motherland; we must turn the wasteland under our feet into a rich granary. Last year, the total grain output of this unit doubled compared with the previous year. The Baigezhuang Farm of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, which has been achieving high yields for years, encountered a severe drought during the rice transplanting season last year. Some people advocated concentrating the use of irrigation water, reducing the transplanting area, and maintaining the high-yield red flag. Under these circumstances, the unit's Party committee first grasped political and ideological work, organizing everyone to discuss "What is the purpose of producing more grain?" Through discussion, everyone further realized that the army's participation in production is for the revolution, and it is the responsibility of revolutionary soldiers to produce more grain in every possible way. The soldiers actively and consciously threw themselves into the fight against drought, and all 7,400 mu of rice paddies were transplanted, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest in the autumn.

    "Learn from Dazhai, strive for high yield" was the fighting slogan of the broad masses of commanders and fighters in last year's agricultural and sideline production. Encouraged by the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai people who relied on their own efforts to build mountainous areas, they went to the sea to reclaim land, went up the mountains to open up wasteland, fought against nature, and competed with heaven for grain. The Jinan Military Region vigorously carried out farmland capital construction, newly opened tens of thousands of mu of paddy fields on the wasteland, and increased the total grain output by more than 80%. A certain regiment of the Shenyang Military Region stationed in a remote mountainous area known as "nine ravines and eighteen slopes, high mountains and many rocks" originally had difficulty eating vegetables. The commanders and fighters earnestly studied the advanced deeds of the Dazhai people in transforming poor mountains and rivers. At the beginning of last year, they carried out activities to transform barren mountain gullies and reclaim land from river beaches with the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people who fought the Wolf's Den three times in the severe winter. They achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables within a short year. Commanders and fighters of a certain unit on the Fujian front line stood in knee-deep mud, stubbornly built a dike more than 2,300 meters long on the East China Sea beach, blocking the rolling waves and reclaiming more than 5,000 mu of sea fields. Every time the construction of the dike failed, they studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people, and finally turned the beach into fertile fields. The garrison troops on a certain island on the East China Sea front line, under the slogan of "Carrying forward the glorious tradition of Nanniwan and learning from the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people," planted vegetables and raised pigs on barren mountains and ridges with perseverance. Because the wind was strong on the island, they built windbreaks with their own hands. When the soil layer was washed away by rain, they went down the mountain to carry it back bit by bit. In this way, they overcame numerous difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest. Last year, the unit's vegetables and meat were all self-sufficient.

      "Having great ambitions, focusing on every seedling," in last year's agricultural and sideline production, the various units followed Chairman Mao's teachings, closely combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific attitude, and exploring and mastering the laws of agricultural production. The Dazhan Farm of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, in order to grasp the laws of rice growth on saline-alkali land, comprehensively summarized the experiences and lessons of fighting saline-alkali land in the previous years. Cadres at all levels grew experimental fields, selected 19 investigation points with different soil qualities and different types of seedlings, grasped typical cases, established models, and guided the production in each link. A certain regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region enthusiastically carried out activities of "learning science, exploring laws, and mastering production technology" on the newly reclaimed sea beach fields. During the seedling raising season, salt water affected the survival of seedlings. The regiment's leading cadres and soldiers squatted by the ditch day and night, measuring the salt content of different water layers during high and low tides, and summarized a method of irrigating during low tide but not during high tide, finally breaking with old ideas and raising good seedlings.

    In the production struggle, while striving to transform the objective world, the broad masses of commanders and fighters also paid attention to transforming the subjective world. The various units used Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to solve one difficult problem after another in production, and the fact of winning bumper harvests made the broad masses of commanders and fighters deeply appreciate the great power of highlighting politics. The leading cadres and soldiers of the various units worked together to wield hoes to open up wasteland and went to the sea to reclaim land, further improving the leadership style and strengthening the relationship between officers and soldiers. Many new soldiers have strengthened their labor concepts and learned the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle through participating in agricultural and sideline production. In particular, many urban educated youths who had newly joined the army have been tempered into five-good soldiers and production experts in production practice. Many soldiers said: A shovel of soil, a bucket of water, and a handful of sweat not only won a bumper harvest, but also tempered our thinking and inherited the glorious tradition of Nanniwan.

    解放军怎样在农副业生产中突出政治？
    把政治思想准备作为完成全年生产任务最重要的准备
    把政治思想工作贯彻到各个生产季节的各种活动中去
    新华社二十六日讯　中国人民解放军各部队在农副业生产中坚持突出政治，用革命精神战胜各种自然灾害，一九六五年粮食、蔬菜又获得大面积丰收。
    去年年初，各部队根据林彪同志关于突出政治的指示，把政治思想准备作为完成全年生产任务最重要的准备工作。广大指战员联系国内外阶级斗争形势，认真学习了毛主席《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等著作，进一步认清了军队参加农副业生产的重大意义，明确树立为革命种田、为战备生产的思想。战士们说：多收一颗粮食，就是对中国人民、对世界革命多一分贡献。在各个生产季节，各部队都重视用政治统率生产，把政治工作贯彻到生产斗争中去。生产任务越忙，政治思想工作抓得越紧。南京部队某部红旗农场自然条件差，风多、水多、草多、虫多，土质碱性大。有些人对夺取丰收缺乏信心。这个部队就从抓活思想入手，组织广大指战员反复学习了毛主席关于艰苦奋斗的论述，使大家认识到在土地与人的关系中，人的因素第一，鼓起了指战员向自然进军的雄心壮志。他们冒着风雪，兴修水利，大积肥料，改良土壤；三伏天，又顶着烈日，灭虫除草。战士们坚定地说：大庆人头顶青天，为祖国拿下了大油田，我们要把脚下的荒地，改变成丰饶的米粮囤。去年这个部队的粮食总产量比前年翻了一番。连年高产的北京部队某部柏各庄农场，去年插秧季节碰到严重干旱，有些人主张集中使用灌溉用水，压缩插秧面积，保持高产红旗。在这种情况下，部队党委首先抓了政治思想工作，组织大家讨论“多打粮食是为了什么？”通过讨论，使大家进一步认识到部队参加生产就是为了革命，千方百计多打粮食是革命战士的责任。战士们积极自觉地投入抗旱斗争，七千四百多亩水稻全部插上了秧苗，为秋后丰收打下了基础。
    “学大寨，夺高产”，是广大指战员在去年农副业生产中的战斗口号。在大寨人自力更生建设山区革命精神的鼓舞下，他们下海围田，上山开荒，与自然奋战，向天公争粮。济南部队大搞农田基本建设，在荒滩上新开水稻田几万亩，使粮食总产量增长百分之八十以上。驻在号称“九沟十八坡，山高石头多”的偏僻山区的沈阳部队某团，原来吃菜比较困难，指战员们认真学习了大寨人改造穷山恶水的先进事迹，去年一开春，就以大寨人在严冬季节三战狼窝掌的革命精神，开展了改造贫瘠山沟、向河滩要地的活动，在短短一年内实现了蔬菜自给。福建前线某部指战员，站在没膝的泥浆里，顽强地在东海滩上筑起两千三百多米长的堤坝，拦住滚滚波涛，围垦了五千多亩海田。筑堤每失败一次，他们就学一次《愚公移山》和大寨人的革命精神，终于把海滩变成良田。东海前哨某岛守备部队，在“发扬南泥湾光荣传统，学习大寨人革命精神”的口号下，以坚韧不拔的毅力，在荒山秃岭上种菜养猪。岛上风大，他们用双手筑起挡风墙，土层被雨水冲走了，他们又到山下一点一滴挑回来。就这样战胜重重困难，获得丰收，去年部队的蔬菜和肉食全部自给。
      “胸怀千斤志，着眼一棵苗”，各部队在去年的农副业生产中，遵循毛主席的教导，把革命热情和科学态度密切结合起来，探求并掌握农业生产的规律。北京部队某部大站农场，为了掌握盐碱地上水稻生长的规律，去年全面总结了前几年与盐碱地作斗争的经验教训，各级干部并大种试验田，选择不同土质、不同苗类设立了十九个调查点，抓典型，树样板，指导各个环节的生产。广州部队某团在新开垦的海滩田上，热烈开展了“学科学，摸规律，掌握生产技术”的活动。在育秧时节，咸水影响秧苗成活，团的领导干部与战士一起，白天黑夜地蹲在水渠边，测量涨潮、退潮时不同水层的含盐量，总结出一套涨潮不灌退潮灌的办法，终于打破了旧观念，育出了好秧。
    在生产斗争中，广大指战员在努力改造客观世界的同时，也注意改造主观世界。各部队用毛泽东思想作指导，解决生产中一个又一个难题，而夺取丰收的事实，更使广大指战员深刻地体会到突出政治的巨大威力。各部队的领导干部和战士一同抡锄开荒，下海围田，进一步改进了领导作风，密切了官兵关系。许多新战士通过参加农副业生产，增强了劳动观点，学到了自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神。特别是新参军的城市知识青年，有不少在生产实践中，锻炼成为五好战士和生产能手。许多战士说：一锹土，一担水，一把汗，不仅夺得了丰收，而且锻炼了思想，接过了南泥湾光荣传统。
