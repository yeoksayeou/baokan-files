    Popularizing Slideshows Should Start From Reality
    The first need of workers, peasants, and soldiers is not "icing on the cake" but "sending charcoal in the snow." Under the current conditions, the task of popularization is even more urgent, and popularization must start from the actual needs and possibilities of the peasants.
    In rural areas, slideshows are an important propaganda tool, reflecting the struggles of real life in a direct and immediate way, something that movies cannot replace. Before each of our film screenings, we use slideshows, combined with the current situation, to publicize the Party's policies, commend local good people and good deeds, which is very popular with the masses. However, once our film team leaves, the slideshow also goes with them. The masses can only see what the film team shows, which cannot meet the needs of the masses. Is it possible to let the peasant masses themselves master this propaganda tool of slideshows, so as to give fuller play to the role of slideshows? Given the current material conditions in rural areas, it is necessary, and in some places possible, to help peasants make simple slide projectors and actively guide them in carrying out amateur slideshow projection and propaganda activities.
    When we first started this work, considering that the vast majority of production teams in rural areas currently do not have electricity, helping peasants make slideshows, we first had to find a way to replace the power source with other light sources. At first, we used gasoline lamps as light sources, although they were relatively bright, they were not easy to control and were expensive; using flashlights as light sources, the light was relatively weak and not cheap either. The most common thing in rural areas currently is kerosene lamps, and using kerosene lamps as the light source for slide projectors is more practical. However, we encountered many problems when we first used kerosene lamps as the light source for slide projectors. The picture on the screen was not imaged, and the brightness was not enough. Several failures made us waver about using kerosene lamps as the light source. With these problems, we studied Chairman Mao's works. We raised our understanding and strengthened our confidence. We realized that using kerosene lamps as the light source is based on the current actual situation in rural areas, which is both economical and practical, and easily accepted by the masses. Through combining with the peasant masses, we received the active support of the masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, which further strengthened our confidence. After more than a dozen experiments, we finally overcame the difficulties and broke through the technical barriers, and helped the peasants make a single-lens simple slide projector using kerosene lamps as the light source. This kind of "earth slide projector" made of a few pieces of wood, a few iron wires, and only costing money to buy a set of lenses, is simple to make, low in cost, and easy to master, and is welcomed by the peasant masses, and has promotional value in rural areas.
    In addition to helping the peasant masses make slide projectors, we also provided guidance in the drawing of slides, the writing of materials, and the operation of slide projectors, and helped the peasants establish an amateur slideshow projection team. An amateur slideshow projection team was established in the mountain and water management professional team of the Desheng Brigade. This slideshow projection team is under the direct leadership of the brigade party branch and is composed of five poor peasant commune members. This amateur slideshow projection team can highlight politics, grasp living ideas, and conduct socialist education on the broad masses of commune members to promote what is proletarian and eliminate what is capitalist. They use local materials, compose and sing themselves, combine with reality, and cooperate with the central task, expressing local real people and real deeds, which are very much loved by the commune members. Some commune members said: "This time we have our own slideshows to perform and sing, this is the first time. It's something we never dared to think of, peasants performing slideshows!"
    Through helping peasants make kerosene slide projectors, establishing amateur slideshow projection teams, and guiding them in using their spare time to carry out slideshow projection and propaganda activities, we have received a profound education. As Chairman Mao taught us, the first need of workers, peasants, and soldiers is not "icing on the cake" but "sending charcoal in the snow," so under the current conditions, the task of popularization is even more urgent. Due to the enthusiastic welcome of the masses to slideshows, we realize that: as film projection workers, we must start from the actual needs and possibilities of the peasants, and wholeheartedly serve the broad masses of peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, so that our work will be meaningful and welcomed by the masses.

    普及幻灯要从实际出发
    工农兵的第一步需要，不是“锦上添花”，而是“雪中送炭”，在目前的条件下，普及的任务更为迫切，而普及又必须从农民的实际需要和可能出发
    幻灯在农村是反映现实生活斗争，短兵相接，用电影所代替不了的一种重要的宣传工具。我们每次放映电影之前，都要通过幻灯，结合形势，宣传党的方针政策、表扬当地的好人好事，很受群众的欢迎。但是，我们电影队一走，幻灯也就带走了，电影队的幻灯演什么，群众才能看到什么，不能满足群众的需要。能不能让农民群众自己也能掌握幻灯这一宣传工具，从而更充分地发挥幻灯的作用呢？就目前农村的物质条件，帮助农民制作简易的幻灯机，并积极辅导农民开展业余幻灯放映宣传活动，是需要的，在有些地方也是可能的。
    我们初进行这一工作时，考虑到当前农村绝大多数的生产队都没有电，帮助农民制作幻灯，首先要设法用其它光源代替电源。开始我们用汽灯作光源，虽然比较亮，但不易掌握，价钱又高；用手电筒作光源，光比较弱，而且也不便宜。当前农村最为普遍使用的是煤油灯，用煤油灯作幻灯机的光源就更有实用价值。但是，开始用煤油灯做幻灯机的光源碰到不少问题。银幕上的画幅不成象，光亮度不够，几次的失败，使我们对煤油灯作光源有些动摇。带着问题，学习了毛主席著作。我们提高了认识，坚定了信心。认识到利用煤油灯作光源，是从农村当前的实际情况出发，既经济又实用，容易被群众所接受。通过与农民群众结合，受到了群众特别是贫下中农的积极支持，更加坚定了我们的信心。经过十几次的实验，终于克服了困难，闯过了技术关，帮助农民制成了用煤油灯作光源的单镜头简易幻灯机。这种用几片木板，几根铁丝，只花钱买一组镜片就可以制成的“土幻灯”，制作简单，成本低，易于掌握，为农民群众所欢迎，在农村有推广价值。
    我们除去帮助农民群众制成了幻灯机，还在幻灯片的绘制，材料的编写，以及幻灯机的操作等方面作了辅导，帮助农民建立一支业余幻灯放映队伍。在得胜大队治山治水专业队建立了业余幻灯放映组，这个幻灯放映组是在大队党支部的直接领导下，由五名贫农社员组成的。这支业余幻灯放映队伍，能够突出政治，抓住活思想，对广大社员进行兴无灭资的社会主义教育。他们就地取材，自编自唱，结合实际，配合中心，表现当地的真人实事，社员十分喜爱。有的社员说：“这回咱们自己有幻灯又演又唱，这还是头一回，庄稼人演幻灯，这可是没敢想的事儿！”
    通过帮助农民制作煤油幻灯机，建立业余幻灯放映组，以及辅导他们利用业余时间进行幻灯放映宣传活动的实践，使我们受到了一次深刻教育。正如毛主席所教导那样，工农兵第一步需要，还不是“锦上添花”，而是“雪中送炭”，所以在目前条件下，普及的任务更为迫切。由于群众对幻灯的热情欢迎，使我们认识到：做为电影放映工作者，必须从农民的实际需要和可能出发，踏踏实实地为广大农民特别是贫下中农服务，我们的工作才有意义，才能受到群众的欢迎。
