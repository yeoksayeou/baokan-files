    "Three Essays" Open the Mind, "Two Theories" Lead the Way
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company Learns from Daqing and Grasps the Most Fundamental Point: Using Mao Zedong Thought to Promote the Revolutionization of People
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, one of the larger iron and steel bases in southern China, was originally a relatively backward enterprise. In the past two years, it has quickly become an advanced enterprise in the national metallurgical sector and Anhui Province, and a good example of learning from Daqing.
    People who visit Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company often ask the question: "The people at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company are the same people as they were two years ago, and the equipment is the same equipment as it was two years ago, so why is there such a big change before and after?"
    The comrades at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company answer: "This is because we 'learn from the Daqing spirit and take the Daqing road.'"
    The comrades at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company answer: "Daqing started with the 'Two Theories,' and we were enlightened by the 'Three Essays' and guided by the 'Two Theories.'" ("Three Essays" are *Serve the People*, *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, and *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*; "Two Theories" are *On Practice* and *On Contradiction*).
    How do they learn from Daqing? How do they rely on the "Three Essays" to open their minds and the "Two Theories" to lead the way?
    Taking the Daqing Road, Running a Daqing-Style Enterprise
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company developed into an iron and steel complex after 1958, based on the original Ma'anshan Iron Factory. After great development and then major adjustments, the achievements were not small, but there were also many problems. These problems were: chaotic thinking among employees, chaotic enterprise management, and chaotic production order. Reflected in production: low production efficiency, high costs, poor quality, and great waste; backward technical and economic indicators; and continuous losses for five years.
    In order to change the backward appearance of the enterprise, the leading comrades of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company had also made various "turnaround plans." There were many "turnaround plans," but the fundamental plan of "ideological revolution" was missing, and the human factor was not included in the plan. Without putting politics in command, without putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, the more plans there were, the more things they asked for. Once they did not get what they wanted, or did not get enough, complaints arose one after another. For example, if ironmaking production did not increase, the workshop blamed the factory, saying that the factory did not provide good raw materials. The factory blamed the mine, saying that the mine did not extract good ore. The mine blamed the company, saying that the company did not give money or equipment in time. The company blamed the higher authorities, saying that the higher authorities did not allocate funds in time to build the mine. In short, they blamed everything but themselves. As a result, the "turnaround plan" became empty talk, and the backward appearance could not be changed.
    At the end of 1963, just as Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company was formulating a new "turnaround plan," the Daqing spirit was introduced to Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. That winter, the responsible comrades of the CPC Ma'anshan Municipal Committee and the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company rushed to Daqing one after another. During the day, they went deep into the field to learn from experience, and at night, they used Daqing as a mirror to check and compare themselves and discuss new "turnaround plans." They began to realize that if Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company wanted to "turn around," it must, like the people of Daqing, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the spirit of the General Line, adhere to class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, arouse revolutionary spirit, strive for strength, and rely on its own efforts. When they returned to Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company from Daqing, they spoke to the broad masses of employees at various meetings, in workshops, dormitories, and employee schools, about the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing in creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, relying on their own efforts, and starting a business through hard work. "Learn from the Daqing spirit, take the Daqing road, and run Daqing-style enterprises!" became the center of people's discussions and people's urgent demands. Under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party Committee, a movement of ideological revolution, management revolution, and technological revolution, with class struggle as the key link and the struggle between the two lines as the key link, unfolded at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    With the deepening of the revolutionary movement, profound changes have taken place in the mental outlook of the people of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company and the appearance of the enterprise. In the past two years, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has comprehensively and overfulfilled the state's production tasks for steel, iron, and steel products every year, and the quality of its products has also been greatly improved. In 1965, the pass rate of pig iron reached more than 99.9%, the pass rate of electric furnace steel reached 100%, and the pass rates of ordinary steel and special steel were also very high. The company's profits turned over to the state have increased year by year.
    In the past two years, the people of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company have used their hardworking hands to move dozens of slag mountains, remove more than 200,000 tons of garbage, scrub more than 3,000 sets of equipment and units, inventory more than 100 million yuan worth of materials, level more than 200,000 square meters of land, and recover 4 million yuan worth of waste materials. The "five constants" phenomenon of "people often idle, lights often on, water often flowing, oil often leaking, and things often lost" no longer exists; the phenomenon of weeds growing everywhere inside and outside the factory area, waste slag forming mountains, and roads being bumpy has also been basically eliminated. The interior of the factory building is bright and clean, the equipment is maintained spotlessly clean, and some are wiped brightly and shining. Tools, equipment, materials, and objects are stacked and hung in an orderly and methodical manner. Many visitors are full of praise for this.
    Faced with all this, the people of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company said earnestly:
      "What we have thrown away is not just the backward hat in production, but the burden of complacency and conservatism on our backs."
      "What we have eliminated is not just slag mountains and garbage, but the thoughts of carelessness,湊合(còu hé - to make do), and indifference in people's minds."
      "What we have polished is not just three thousand sets of machinery and equipment, but the ideological weapons of millions of people."
      "What we have recovered is not just waste materials, but we have picked up the word 'thrift' that we had lost."
    Indeed, in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, the revolutionary spirit is now greatly enhanced. The broad masses of cadres and employees are high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, and wholeheartedly for the revolution.
    Learning from Daqing, Grasping the Most Fundamental Point
    How to learn from Daqing? The comrades at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company have grasped the most fundamental point, which is to, like Daqing, focus on creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all work, and use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate a revolutionized team.
    According to Chairman Mao's teachings in the "Two Theories," they used Daqing as a mirror, analyzed the situation of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, and found the main contradictions: one was the lack of energy in people's mental state, and the other was the backwardness of enterprise management. Because production was not good, they were often criticized, and the cadres and employees, especially the leading cadres, were in low spirits, carrying a backward burden on their backs, and their spirits were bound. The backwardness of enterprise management was mainly manifested in "loose, scattered, chaotic, dirty, and wasteful," which was very unsuitable for the requirements of a modern socialist large-scale enterprise. This is the backwardness of the relations of production compared to the development of the productive forces. And the backwardness of enterprise management is closely related to the lack of energy in people's mental state, and the decisive factor is the lack of energy in people's mental state. If people's spirits are not uplifted, it will be impossible to change the backward appearance of the enterprise. Therefore, the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee and the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company decided: to focus their main energy on grasping the struggle in the ideological field, grasping ideological and political work, grasping the ideological revolutionization of people, eliminating negative factors, and mobilizing positive factors; on the basis of promoting the ideological revolutionization of people, to carry out management revolution and technological revolution.
  Using Mao Zedong Thought to Build a Revolutionized Team
    In order to invigorate the mental state of cadres and employees and promote the ideological revolutionization of people, the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company prominently focused on creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They often educated employees with the viewpoint of class and class struggle, often educated employees with the spirit of the General Line, and often educated cadres and workers to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all work.
    The Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company also often took the People's Liberation Army and Daqing as examples, repeatedly and deeply publicizing the "Three-Eight Style" of the People's Liberation Army and the "Three Olds and Four Stricts" and "Four Same" style of Daqing. Use living examples to encourage and educate cadres and workers.
    After nearly two years of efforts, a revolutionized team armed with Mao Zedong Thought is growing up.
    Now, a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works has formed throughout the company. Each factory and mine has a "hall of honor," which is actually a study room for the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's *Serve the People*, *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*, *Combat Liberalism* as well as *On Practice* and *On Contradiction* and other articles have become the spiritual food of the broad masses of employees and cadres, and have become the magic weapon to guide their actions. Many people have repeatedly studied these articles, and when they encounter difficult things, they study them, and they have enough energy to overcome the difficulties. Many cadres have also learned to use Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems in their work. When work is difficult or conditions are unfavorable, they focus on checking their own subjective initiative according to Chairman Mao's instructions that "morale can be boosted, not dampened" and the teachings in the "Two Theories"; when work is smooth, they use Chairman Mao's thought of "one divides into two" to affirm achievements and find gaps. By constantly grasping and repeatedly grasping in this way, the mental outlook of the broad masses of employees has undergone profound changes.
    For example: the No. 13 blast furnace of the No. 1 Iron Plant originally could not increase production. The blast furnace blamed the workshop, and the workshop blamed the factory. After studying Chairman Mao's works and the Daqing spirit, they turned "blaming others" into "blaming themselves." Cadres at all levels, in accordance with Chairman Mao's incisive thesis in *On Contradiction* that "materialist dialectics believes that external causes are the conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes," profoundly examined themselves, and each found the reasons subjectively and actively created conditions for ironmaking production. As a result, the No. 13 blast furnace neither increased personnel nor added equipment, and both output and quality increased, leaping into the national advanced ranks.
    For example: Bu Yunqing's team of the Electrical and Mechanical Section of the No. 1 Steel Plant, in maintaining old equipment, studied Chairman Mao's works every time they encountered a difficulty. After studying *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains* seven times, after twenty-six days of hard struggle, they finally completed all the tasks of thorough cleaning, removing oil putty, removing rust, adjusting, self-inspecting and self-repairing parts, and painting and renovating. After inspection by the company, it was awarded the honorary title of "Five-Good Equipment."
    Now, in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, socialist ideas are greatly promoted. Many employees consciously fight against the word "I" in their thoughts, fight against the word "difficult" in production, and fight against the word "lazy" in their lives.
    Now, in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, the broad masses of cadres and employees are high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. More and more people are talking about revolution, politics, production, and striving for advancement. The spirit of not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of fatigue, being fearless in the face of danger, wholeheartedly for the people, and wholeheartedly for the revolution is greatly promoted.
    Now, in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, the idea of ​​not being willing to fall behind and striving to be advanced is greatly promoted. The kind of gloomy mental state in the past has been swept away.
    Now, in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, a style of strict requirements, meticulousness, swift action, doing what one says, and doing it well, has also been initially cultivated.
  People's Thoughts Have Changed, and the Appearance of the Enterprise Has Also Changed
    People's revolutionary spirit has been invigorated, and the mass movement of learning from Daqing and catching up with Daqing is in full swing. Thousands of big-character posters and thousands of letters of determination were sent to the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee and the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, exposing backwardness and expressing great ambitions.
    Cadres could no longer sit in the buildings and went "downstairs" one after another, going to squat on the spot like the people of Daqing and going to "work." Engineering and technical personnel could no longer squat in the offices and went to "serve" like the people of Daqing. The broad masses of employees were even more high-spirited and full of fighting spirit.
    The road to turn over has been found, but how to go the road and where to fight the battle? At this time, the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee and the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, based on the experience of typical experiments, decided to start with changing the dirt and disorder that had long existed in the enterprise to promote the revolution in the entire enterprise management. As a result, a struggle to change the production environment and improve labor conditions was widely launched throughout the company.
    This struggle is not only a production struggle, but also a struggle between two ideologies and two styles. In this struggle, 348 grassroots production units and 40 material and equipment warehouses successively achieved clean factory areas (warehouses), clean workshops (warehouses), and clean equipment (materials), and excellently achieved clean production. It broke the old framework and old concept that "metallurgical enterprises eat a lot, pull a lot, are big, and are heavy, and dirt and disorder are destined," proving that metallurgical enterprises can completely achieve clean factory areas, fresh equipment, and orderly production environments. This initiative is a profound self-revolution for the enterprise's leading cadres, technical personnel, and production workers.
    In this regard, the sintering plant is a prominent example. This plant is a factory that deals with "three powders" (mineral powder, coke powder, limestone powder) all day long and is one of the dirtiest production units in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. The "return mine ditch" is the dirtiest section of the factory. Workers compared this place to a "desert area" and called it a "big gray nest." Operators wear twenty-four layers of gauze masks, and after working for a day, they inevitably inhale some dust. In the past, the factory leaders had also made up their minds, but they always placed their hopes on adding foreign equipment, but their hopes were always dashed. After learning from Daqing, the factory director mobilized the masses and personally took the lead to work here, making "earth" dust removal equipment with the workers through self-reliance. Finally, there was some residual dust that could not be removed, so they worked three shifts day and night, sweeping twelve times and spraying water twelve times every day without interruption. As a result, the "big gray nest" became an advanced unit of clean production. Labor conditions have improved, people's moods are cheerful, and production efficiency has also greatly improved.
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company concentrates its strength on fighting battles one after another in the enterprise management revolution and has achieved one victory after another. They made a big revolution in managing and using equipment well, renovating, matching, and maintaining more than 3,000 sets of equipment and units, and completely eliminating the phenomenon of lights being always on, water always flowing, oil always dripping, gas always leaking, and equipment often breaking down. They made a big revolution in hard work, and more than 300 production teams have developed hard skills.
      "People change their minds, and factories change their appearance." People's thoughts have changed, and the enterprise's management and technical appearance has also changed.
    Now, people everywhere praise Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. However, from the experience of turning over, the people of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company deeply realize that: at any time, they should keep in mind Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind," and at any time, they should look forward, look to Daqing, and look to all advanced units, learn from others' strengths and compare them with their own weaknesses, and go to a higher level. Otherwise, if you only see the little bit of achievements under your nose and become complacent, the result will inevitably lead to backwardness.

    “三篇”开窍“两论”引路
    马钢学大庆抓到了最根本的一条  运用毛泽东思想促进人的革命化
    我国江南较大的钢铁基地之一——马鞍山钢铁公司，原来是一个比较落后的企业。近两年来，很快变成了全国冶金部门和安徽省的一个先进企业，成为学习大庆的一个好榜样。
    到马钢参观的人，常常提出这样一个问题：“马钢的人还是前两年的那些人，设备还是前两年的那些设备，为什么前后变化这么大？”
    马钢的同志回答是：“这是由于‘学大庆精神，走大庆道路’。”
    马钢的同志回答是：“大庆是靠‘两论’起家的，我们是靠‘三篇’开窍，‘两论’引路的。”（“三篇”是《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》，“两论”是《实践论》《矛盾论》）
    他们怎样学大庆？他们怎样靠“三篇”开窍，“两论”引路？
    走大庆道路，办大庆式企业
    马钢是在一九五八年以后，在原来马鞍山铁厂的基础上，发展成为一个钢铁联合企业的。经过大发展，又经过大调整，成绩不小，但问题也很多。这些问题就是：职工思想混乱、企业管理混乱、生产秩序混乱。反映在生产上就是：生产效率低，成本高，质量差，浪费大；技术经济指标落后；连续亏本五年。
    为了改变企业的落后面貌，马钢的领导同志也曾经做过多种“翻身方案”。“翻身方案”很多，唯独缺少“思想革命”这个根本的方案，没有把人的因素纳入方案之中。政治不挂帅，毛泽东思想不挂帅，方案越多，伸手要的东西也就越多。一旦东西没有要到，或要的不多，埋怨情绪就纷纷出现。如炼铁生产上不去，车间怪厂部，说厂部没有给好原料。厂部怪矿山，说矿山没有采出好矿石。矿山怪公司，说公司没有及时给钱给设备。公司怪上级，说上级没有及时拨款建设矿山。总之，他们怨天怨地就是不怨自己。结果，“翻身方案”变成了一纸空谈，落后面貌老是改变不了。
    一九六三年底，正当马钢制订新的“翻身方案”的时候，大庆精神传到了马钢。当年冬天，中共马鞍山市委和马钢党委的负责同志，相继赶到大庆。他们白天深入现场取经，夜晚则以大庆作镜子，检查对照自己，议论新的“翻身方案”。他们开始认识到，马钢要“翻身”，必须象大庆人那样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持总路线精神，坚持阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，振起革命精神，奋发图强，自力更生。他们从大庆回到马钢，便在各种会议上，在车间、宿舍、职工学校里，向广大职工大讲大庆人活学活用毛泽东思想，自力更生，艰苦创业的革命精神。“学大庆精神，走大庆道路，办大庆式的企业！”成为人们议论的中心，成为人们的迫切要求。在上级党委的正确领导下，一个以阶级斗争为纲，以两条道路斗争为纲的思想革命运动、管理革命运动和技术革命运动，在马钢展开了。
    随着革命运动的深入发展，马钢人的精神面貌和企业面貌发生了深刻的变化。两年来，马钢年年全面地超额完成国家交给的钢、铁、钢材等各项生产任务，产品质量也大大提高。一九六五年生铁的合格率达到百分之九十九点九以上，电炉钢的合格率达到百分之百，普通钢材和特种钢材的合格率也都很高。全公司上缴利润一年比一年增多。
    两年来，马钢人用自己勤劳的双手，搬走了数十座渣山，铲除了二十多万吨垃圾，擦洗了三千多台（个）设备和机组，盘点了价值一亿多元的物资，平整了二十多万平方米场地，回收了价值四百万元的废旧物资。过去那种“人常闲、灯常明、水常流、油常漏、物常丢”的“五常”现象没有了；厂区内外杂草丛生，废渣成山，道路坑洼不平的现象，也已经基本消除。厂房内部窗明地净，设备维护得一尘不染，有的擦得明亮发光。工具、设备、材料、物件堆放悬挂，都是秩序井然，有条不紊。不少参观者对此赞叹不止。
    面对着这一切，马钢人语重心长地说：
      “我们扔掉的不是什么生产上的落后帽，而是背在身上的自满保守的包袱。”
      “我们铲除的不光是什么渣山、垃圾，而是人们心头上的马虎、凑合、满不在乎的思想。”
      “我们擦亮的不光是三千台机器设备，而是擦亮了千万人的思想武器。”
      “我们回收的不光是废旧物资，而是把丢掉了的‘勤俭’二字又拾了起来。”
    的确，在马钢，现在是革命精神大振。广大干部和职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，不怕苦，不怕累，一心一意为革命。
    学大庆，抓到了最根本的一条
    怎样学大庆？马钢的同志抓到了最根本的一条，这就是象大庆那样，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指针，用毛泽东思想培养一支革命化的队伍。
    他们根据毛主席在“两论”中的教导，以大庆作镜子，分析了马钢的形势，找出主要的矛盾：一是人的精神状态不振，一是企业管理落后。由于生产搞不好，经常受到批评，干部和职工，特别是领导干部情绪灰溜溜的，身上背着一个落后的包袱，精神受束缚。企业管理落后，主要表现为“松、散、乱、脏、费”，跟现代化的社会主义大企业的要求很不适应。这就是生产关系落后于生产力的发展。而企业管理落后，跟人的精神状态不振又是密切连系着的，起决定性作用的是人的精神状态不振这个问题。如果不把人们的精神振奋起来，要改变企业的落后面貌是不可能的。因此，马鞍山市委和马钢党委决定：用主要精力抓意识形态的斗争，抓思想政治工作，抓人的思想革命化，消除消极因素，调动积极因素；在促进人的思想革命化的基础上，进行管理革命和技术革命。
  运用毛泽东思想，建设革命化队伍
    为了把干部和职工的精神状态振奋起来，促进人的思想革命化，马钢党委突出地抓住了活学活用毛泽东思想。他们经常以阶级和阶级斗争的观点教育职工，经常以总路线的精神教育职工，经常教育干部、工人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，以毛主席思想为一切工作的指针。
    马钢党委还经常以解放军、大庆为榜样，反复地深入宣传解放军的“三八作风”和大庆的“三老四严”、“四个一样”的作风。用活的榜样来鼓舞和教育干部和工人。
    经过近两年来的努力，一支以毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化队伍，正在成长起来。
    现在全公司已经形成一个群众性的学习毛主席著作的热潮。每个厂矿都有一个“荣誉室”，实际上都是群众学毛主席著作的学习室。毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》，以及《实践论》、《矛盾论》等几篇文章，已经成为广大职工和干部的精神食粮，成为指导自己行动的法宝。很多人反复学习了这些文章，遇到困难的事，学一学，战胜困难的劲头就足了。有不少干部也学会了运用毛主席思想来解决工作中的实际问题。当工作困难或条件不利的时候，就根据毛主席“气可鼓不可泄”的指示和在“两论”中的教导，着重检查自己的主观能动性；当工作顺利的时候，就用毛主席“一分为二”的思想来肯定成绩、寻找差距。这样不断抓，反复抓，广大职工精神面貌就发生了深刻变化。
    例如：一铁厂的十三号高炉，原先生产上不去，高炉怪车间，车间怪厂部，一级怪一级。学毛主席著作和大庆精神以后，他们把“怪人”变为“责己”，各级干部都按照毛主席在《矛盾论》中关于“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用”的精辟论断，深刻地检查了自己，各自都从主观上找原因，积极为炼铁生产创造条件。结果，十三号高炉既未增人，也未添设备，产量、质量都上去了，一举跃入全国先进行列。
    例如：一钢厂机电工段乙班步云青小组，在维护旧设备中，每遇到一次困难，就学一次毛主席著作，前后七次学习《愚公移山》，经过二十六天的艰苦奋斗，终于全部完成彻底清洗、铲油灰、除锈蚀、调整、自检自修零件油漆翻新等任务。经公司检验，被授予“五好”设备的光荣称号。
    现在，在马钢，社会主义思想大大发扬。很多职工自觉地在思想上同“我”字作斗争，在生产上同“难”字作斗争，在生活上同“懒”字作斗争。
    现在，在马钢，广大干部和职工意气风发，斗志昂扬。讲革命，讲政治，讲生产，讲争上游的人越来越多。不怕苦，不怕累，临危不惧，一心一意为人民，全心全意为革命的精神大大发扬。
    现在，在马钢，不甘落后，争当先进的思想大大发扬。过去那种灰溜溜的精神状态已经一扫而光了。
    现在，在马钢，一个严格要求，一丝不苟，雷厉风行，说干就干，干就干好的作风，也已经初步培养起来了。
  人的思想变了，企业面貌也变了
    人的革命精神奋发起来，学大庆赶大庆的群众运动风起云涌。成千上万张大字报、成千上万张决心书传送到马鞍山市委和马钢党委，一揭落后盖子，一表壮志雄心。
    干部在大楼上坐不住了，纷纷“下楼”，象大庆人那样蹲点去了，“上岗”劳动去了。工程技术人员在办公室里也蹲不住了，纷纷象大庆人那样“上门”服务去了。广大职工群众，更是意气风发，斗志昂扬。
    翻身之路找到了，但是，路如何走，仗从那里打。这时，马鞍山市委和马钢党委根据典型试验的经验，决心从改变企业长期存在着的脏、乱入手，来推动整个企业管理的革命。于是，一场改变生产环境和改善劳动条件的斗争，便在全公司广泛开展。
    这场斗争，既是生产斗争，又是两种思想、两种作风之间的斗争。在这场斗争中，他们先后有三百四十八个基层生产单位，四十个材料设备仓库，实现了厂区（仓库）环境清、车间（库房）内部清、设备（材料）本体清，出色地做到了整洁生产。打破了“冶金企业就是吃的多、拉的多、大的多、重的多”，脏、乱是‘命’中注定”的老框框、老概念，证明冶金企业完全能做到厂区整洁，设备清新，生产环境有条不紊。这一创举，对企业的领导干部、技术人员，连同生产工人在内，都是一场深刻的自我革命。
    在这方面，烧结厂是一个突出的例子。这个厂是一个整天和“三粉”（矿粉、焦粉、石灰石粉）打交道的工厂，是马钢最脏的生产单位之一。“返矿地沟”，又是这个厂的最脏的地段。工人把这个地方比作“沙漠地带”，称作“大灰窝”。操作人员戴上二十四层沙布口罩，一天工作下来，也免不了要吸进去一些灰尘。过去，厂领导也下过决心，但总是把希望寄托在添制洋设备上，结果希望总是落空。学大庆后，厂长把群众发动起来，并亲自带头到这里劳动，和工人一起自力更生制作“土”的除尘设备。最后，还有些残余粉尘实在除不尽，他们就日夜三班，大扫十二次，喷水十二回，日日如此，从不间断，结果，“大灰窝”变成了整洁生产的先进单位。劳动条件改善了，人们的心情舒畅了，生产效率也随着大大提高。
    马钢在企业管理革命上集中力量一个仗一个仗地打，取得一个又一个的胜利。他们在管好用好设备上大闹革命，把三千多台（个）设备和机组，维修配套保养一新，彻底消除了灯常明、水常流、油常滴、气常漏、设备常坏的现象。他们在苦练硬功上大闹革命，有三百多个生产班组练成了过得硬的功夫。
      “人变思想厂变容”，人的思想变了，企业的管理和技术面貌也变了。
    现在，人们到处称赞马钢。但马钢人从翻身的经验中，深刻地体会到：在任何时候都应该牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，在任何时候都应该向前看，向大庆看，向一切先进单位看，以人之长，比己之短，更上一层楼。否则，只看到鼻尖下面的一点点成绩，就沾沾自喜起来，其结果必然要走向落后。
