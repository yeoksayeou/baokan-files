    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    "If the movement of knowledge in dialectical materialism stopped at perceptual knowledge, that would only be dealing with one half of the problem. And as far as Marxist philosophy is concerned, it would only be dealing with the less important half. Marxist philosophy considers that the most important problem is not understanding the laws of the objective world, thus being able to explain the world, but using this understanding of objective laws to actively transform the world."
                                              "On Practice"

    毛主席语录
    “辩证唯物论的认识运动，如果只到理性认识为止，那末还只说到问题的一半。而且对于马克思主义的哲学说来，还只说到非十分重要的那一半。马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。”
