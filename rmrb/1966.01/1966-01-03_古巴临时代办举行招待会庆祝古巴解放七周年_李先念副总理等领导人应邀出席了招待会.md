    Cuban Chargé d'Affaires Holds Reception to Celebrate the Seventh Anniversary of Cuban Liberation
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Other Leaders Attended the Reception
    Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd. Lázaro Fernández, Chargé d'Affaires of the Cuban Embassy in China, held a reception tonight to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Cuban Liberation.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Sino-Cuban Friendship Association Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, as well as government ministers Zeng Shan, Zhang Xiruo, Duan Junyi, Liu Wenhui, and Xu Yunbei were invited to attend the reception.

    In his speech at the reception, Chargé d'Affaires Lázaro Fernández said that the reality of the Cuban revolution shows that U.S. imperialism has suffered a serious setback in Latin America. The liberation movements currently developing in countries such as the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Peru, and Colombia clearly show that it is becoming increasingly difficult for U.S. imperialism to flaunt its power in Latin America. Today, revolution is inevitable in many Latin American countries. He mentioned the achievements of the Cuban people in construction.

    The Chargé d'Affaires condemned the series of heinous aggressions of U.S. imperialism against Cuba. He said, "We have realized that once the struggle against U.S. imperialism begins, it must be persisted in, and it must always be dealt heavy blows at its sore spots, and every attack and any expression must be responded to with tit-for-tat measures." He expressed Cuba's support for the heroic South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    Speaking of the militant, revolutionary friendship between the people of Cuba and China, the Chargé d'Affaires said that the Cuban people are happy for the achievements of the Chinese people in their socialist construction, in which the Chinese people have overcome enormous difficulties and held high the banner of anti-imperialist struggle.

    In his speech at the reception, Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out that the victory of the Cuban revolution is the victory of armed revolution against armed counter-revolution, and the victory of daring to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism. The two Havana Declarations of the Cuban people correctly pointed out the revolutionary path of mutual support and united anti-Americanism for the Cuban people and the people of various Latin American countries. The Chinese people sincerely wish the Cuban people to continue to advance along the revolutionary path of the two Havana Declarations.

    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that in the past year, the national democratic revolution of the people of various Latin American countries has continued to develop. Recently, the anti-American struggle of the Dominican people has seen a new upsurge. The armed intervention of U.S. imperialism in the Dominican Republic has aroused a higher anti-American wave among the people of various Latin American countries. More and more people in Latin American countries have launched mass movements and armed struggles against the United States and against dictatorships. In order to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Latin American people, the United States is planning to organize a "Permanent Pan-American Force," attempting to use Latin Americans to fight Latin Americans. However, this conspiracy will not succeed. The Chinese people resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the Latin American people and firmly believe that the Latin American people, after a long, tortuous, and arduous struggle, will surely be able to overthrow U.S. imperialism and achieve complete liberation.

    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that 1966 will be a year of deeper development of the revolutionary struggles of the people all over the world. Of course, the road of revolution is tortuous, and the revolutionary people will encounter this or that difficulty on the road forward. However, these are only local and temporary phenomena. The torrent of revolution of the people all over the world is surging forward, and no force can stop it.

    Vice Premier Li Xiannian finally said that the people of China and Cuba have a long-standing militant friendship. Now, the people of our two countries are also facing the same combat tasks of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and provocations. We firmly believe that the people of China and Cuba will do everything possible to maintain and strengthen their friendship, and support each other more closely in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    Also invited to attend the reception were Qiao Guanhua, Chu Tunan, Lei Renmin, Wang Xinting, Zhang Zhirang, Huang Huoxing, Le Songsheng, and other leaders of relevant government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality.

    Diplomatic envoys of various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Beijing Sino-Cuban Friendship People's Commune and the Sino-Cuban Friendship Primary School held soirees on December 28th and 29th of last year respectively to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Cuban Liberation.

    Fernández, Chargé d'Affaires of the Cuban Embassy in China, and Eduardo Santos, Commercial Counselor, and others, attended the above-mentioned soirees respectively.

    古巴临时代办举行招待会庆祝古巴解放七周年
    李先念副总理等领导人应邀出席了招待会
    新华社二日讯　古巴驻中国大使馆临时代办拉萨罗·费尔南德斯今晚举行招待会，庆祝古巴解放七周年。
    国务院副总理李先念，人大常委会副委员长、中古友协会长刘宁一，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，以及政府部长曾山、张奚若、段君毅、刘文辉、徐运北应邀出席了招待会。
    拉萨罗·费尔南德斯临时代办在招待会上讲话，他说，古巴革命的现实表明美帝国主义在拉丁美洲遭受到了严重的挫折。目前在多米尼加共和国、委内瑞拉、秘鲁、哥伦比亚等国发展的解放运动清楚地表明，美帝国主义依靠它在拉丁美洲的权势耀武扬威日益困难了。今天，革命在很多拉丁美洲国家是不可避免的。他提到了古巴人民在建设中取得的成就。
    临时代办谴责美帝国主义对古巴进行一连串的穷凶极恶的侵略。他说，我们体会到，一旦开始了反对美帝国主义的斗争，就必须坚持下去，并且永远对它的痛处给以沉重的打击，对它每次进攻和任何表示都给以针锋相对的回答。他表示古巴支持英雄的南越人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    在谈到古中两国人民之间战斗的、革命的友谊时，临时代办说，古巴人民为中国人民在其社会主义建设中取得的成就而高兴，在建设中，中国人民战胜了巨大的困难，高举着反帝斗争的旗帜。
    李先念副总理在招待会上讲话时指出，古巴革命的胜利，是以武装的革命反对武装的反革命的胜利，是敢于同美帝国主义进行针锋相对斗争的胜利。古巴人民的两个哈瓦那宣言，正确地指出了古巴人民和拉丁美洲各国人民相互支援、团结反美的革命道路。中国人民衷心地祝愿古巴人民沿着两个哈瓦那宣言的革命道路继续前进。
    李先念副总理说，一年来，拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主革命在继续发展。最近多米尼加人民的反美斗争又有了新的兴起。美帝国主义对多米尼加人民的武装干涉，激起了拉丁美洲各国人民更高的反美浪潮。越来越多的拉丁美洲国家的人民掀起了反美、反独裁的群众运动和武装斗争。美国为了镇压拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，正在策划组织“常设泛美部队”，企图用拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人。但是，这个阴谋是不能得逞的。中国人民坚决支持拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，并且深信，拉丁美洲人民经过长期、曲折、艰苦的斗争，一定能够打倒美帝国主义，获得彻底的解放。
    李先念副总理说，一九六六年将是全世界人民革命斗争更加深入发展的一年。当然，革命的道路是曲折的，革命的人民在前进的道路上还会遇到这样或那样的困难。但是，这只是局部的暂时的现象。全世界人民革命的洪流汹涌直前，是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
    李先念副总理最后说，中古两国人民有着悠久的战斗友谊。现在，我们两国人民又都同样地面临着维护国家主权和领土完整、反对美帝国主义侵略和挑衅的战斗任务。我们深信，中古两国人民一定会尽一切力量维护和加强彼此的友谊，在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，更加紧密地互相支援。
    应邀出席招待会的还有政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、人民团体、民主党派和北京市的负责人乔冠华、楚图南、雷任民、王新亭、张志让、黄火星、乐松生等。
    各国驻华使节也应邀出席了招待会。
    据新华社讯　北京市中古友好人民公社和中古友谊小学分别于去年十二月二十八日和二十九日举行晚会，庆祝古巴解放七周年。
    古巴驻中国大使馆临时代办费尔南德斯和商务参赞艾杜阿尔多·桑托斯等人，分别参加了上述晚会。
