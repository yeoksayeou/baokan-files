    American imperialism is stepping up its efforts to use Thailand as an aggressive base for expanding the war in Indochina and is driving the Thai reactionaries to act as accomplices in aggression. The recent US preparations to increase troops in Thailand, expand military facilities in Thailand, instigate Thailand to send troops to participate in the attack on the Lao liberated areas, and continuously carry out military provocations against Cambodia in coordination with the South Vietnamese puppets are all powerful proofs of this.
    All these actions by American imperialism and the Thai Thanom government are leading Thailand down a dangerous path. Thailand has completely lost its national independence and will become a battlefield for American aggressors, putting the Thai people on the verge of a serious national disaster. Therefore, in order to save the country from peril and to oppose the adventurous plans of American imperialism and its running dogs, the Thai people have risen up and launched an armed self-defense struggle. They are determined to overthrow the traitorous and reactionary rule of the Thanom government and strive for the liberation of their motherland through people's war. The patriotic self-defense struggle of the Thai people is completely just.
    Faced with the vigorously developing armed struggle of the Thai people, American imperialism and its running dog, the Thanom government, have fallen into a state of panic. They have repeatedly exclaimed that the current situation in Thailand is like the situation five years ago when the South Vietnamese people's armed struggle began, and are therefore intensifying armed suppression in an attempt to extinguish this spark that threatens to become a prairie fire. However, as the victorious development of the South Vietnamese people's war has proven, the military suppression by American imperialism and its running dogs is simply adding fuel to the fire. Since they want to turn Thailand into a second South Vietnam, they will inevitably suffer the same fate they suffered in South Vietnam. American imperialism has, in effect, put another noose around its own neck in Thailand. The Thanom government, willingly acting as an accomplice of American imperialism and betraying Thailand's national independence and sovereignty, will definitely not end well. As Chairman Mao said: "Slaves who are dead set on letting American imperialism lead them by the nose will only be buried with American imperialism in the end." The just cause of the Thai people to strive for national liberation will surely be victorious.

    又套上一条绞索
    美帝国主义正在加紧利用泰国作为扩大印度支那战争的侵略基地，并驱使泰国反动派充当侵略帮凶。最近美国准备增兵泰国，在泰国扩充军事设施，唆使泰国派兵参加对老挝解放区的进攻，并同南越傀儡互相配合不断对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅，这一切都是有力的证明。
    美帝国主义和泰国他侬政府的这一切勾当，正在把泰国引向危险的道路。泰国已完全丧失了民族独立，并将变为美国侵略者的一个战场，使泰国人民面临着一场严重的民族灾难。因此，为了拯救祖国的危亡，为了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的冒险计划，泰国人民已经揭竿而起，展开了武装自卫斗争。他们决心通过进行人民战争来推翻他侬政府的卖国反动统治，争取祖国的解放。泰国人民的爱国自卫斗争，是完全正义的。
    面对着泰国人民蓬勃发展的武装斗争，美帝国主义及其走狗他侬政府已经陷于一片慌乱。他们一再惊呼，泰国目前的局势有如五年前南越人民武装斗争开展之初的局势，因而正在加紧武装镇压，力图扑灭这场势成燎原的星星之火。但是，正如南越人民战争的胜利发展过程所证明的，美帝国主义及其走狗的武力镇压，不过是火上加油而已。既然它们要把泰国变成第二个南越，就必然要遭到它们在南越同样的结果。美帝国主义在泰国实际上又为自己套上一条绞索。他侬政府甘心充当美帝国主义帮凶，出卖泰国民族独立主权，是决不会有好下场的。正如毛主席所说的：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬”。泰国人民争取民族解放的正义事业，一定能够取得胜利。
