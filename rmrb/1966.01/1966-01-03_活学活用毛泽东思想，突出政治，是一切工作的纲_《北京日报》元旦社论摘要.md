    The Third Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy has begun. The people of the capital, along with the people of the whole country, are using practical actions and are full of confidence to greet the new combat missions.

    1965, like the whole country, saw an excellent situation in Beijing. Now, we are faced with glorious and arduous new tasks. What do we rely on to accomplish this glorious and arduous task? Of the thousands of things, the most important thing is still to vigorously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and give prominence to politics. Vigorously studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and giving prominence to politics is the key link in all work. The key to giving prominence to politics is giving prominence to Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong is the great standard-bearer of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism that has been creatively developed in the era of imperialism heading towards collapse and socialism heading towards victory. Our Party's guiding ideology, our Party's experience in struggle, and our Party's theory are most concisely concentrated in Mao Zedong Thought. It is not only the crystallization of the experience and lessons forged in blood by the Chinese people in decades of revolutionary struggle, but also synthesizes the achievements of predecessors, absorbs the rich experience of the world proletariat's revolutionary struggle, is a generalization of Marxism-Leninism on a richer practical basis, and is contemporary great Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and reactionaries of all countries, a powerful ideological weapon against modern revisionism and modern dogmatism, a pointer for our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, a pointer for all our work in all walks of life, and also a pointer for the revolutionization of our cadre and mass ranks. In our struggle against enemies at home and abroad, in our struggle against nature, Mao Zedong Thought is the best weapon, and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat force. Using Mao Zedong Thought to take command is the most fundamental guarantee for us to do all work well.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us: political work is the lifeline of all economic work, it is the soul, it is the commander. Only by putting politics in command can we adhere to the correct position and direction. In a society with classes, politics is class struggle. The putting politics in command that we speak of must be proletarian politics in command, must be Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in command. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to take command can we stand firmly on the proletarian position, adhere to the socialist direction, and make all our actions beneficial to the people of China and the world, and beneficial to the overall situation of socialist revolution and construction. If we implement so-called "professionalism in command," in reality, it will allow all kinds of bourgeois ideology to take command, and will allow individualism, departmentalism, passive sluggishness, extravagance and waste, etc., to take command. As a result, the work will definitely not be done well, and bad people and bad things will emerge, and we will embark on the wrong path, and even allow class enemies to have the opportunity to implement their "peaceful evolution" conspiracy. The struggle between putting politics in command and putting professionalism in command is essentially the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. In some units, it is the struggle between two roads and two lines, the struggle of what nature to turn a unit into, and the struggle of which road to lead the team to. We must have a clear understanding of this issue.

    To vigorously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and give prominence to politics, we must strengthen Party building. To this end, we must actively, relatively greatly, and cautiously accept new Party members in accordance with the standards stipulated in the Party Constitution. We must resolutely, boldly, and gradually train and promote new forces in accordance with the principle of both ability and integrity, and train successors to the proletarian revolution who are both red and expert. We must further strengthen branch building, and adhere to and carry forward the three major work styles put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong of combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and self-criticism. The three major work styles are a scientific summary of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on Party building and are fundamental to Party building. If branch building grasps this link, it will grasp the essentials, and it will be able to further improve the Party organization's combat effectiveness, truly build the Party branch into a strong fighting fortress, better arm Party members with Mao Zedong Thought, better play an exemplary leading role, unite the broad masses, and win more victories in the three major revolutionary struggles.

    活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，是一切工作的纲
    ——《北京日报》元旦社论摘要
    发展国民经济的第三个五年计划开始了。首都人民和全国人民一起，正在用实际行动，满怀信心地迎接新的战斗任务。
    一九六五年，北京和全国一样，是一片大好形势。现在，我们面临着光荣而艰巨的新任务。完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务靠什么？千条万条，最重要的一条还是活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治。活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，是一切工作的纲。突出政治的关键是突出毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志是当代马克思列宁主义的伟大旗手。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向崩溃、社会主义走向胜利的时代，创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义。我们党的指导思想，我们党的斗争经验，我们党的理论，最概括地集中在毛泽东思想里。它不仅是我国人民在几十年革命斗争中以鲜血凝成的经验教训的结晶，而且综合了前人的成果，吸收了世界无产阶级革命斗争的丰富经验，是马克思列宁主义在更丰富的实践基础上的概括，是当代伟大的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器，是反对现代修正主义和现代教条主义的强大思想武器，是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指针，是我们各行各业一切工作的指针，也是我们干部和群众队伍革命化的指针。在我们同国内外敌人的斗争中，在同大自然的斗争中，毛泽东思想是最好的武器，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我们做好一切工作的最根本的保证。
    毛泽东同志反复教导我们：政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，是灵魂，是统帅。只有政治挂帅，才能坚持正确的立场和方向。在有阶级的社会里，政治就是阶级斗争。我们说的政治挂帅，必须是无产阶级政治挂帅，必须是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想挂帅。只有用毛泽东思想挂帅，我们才能够站稳无产阶级立场，坚持社会主义方向，使我们的一切行动都有利于全中国和全世界人民，有利于社会主义革命和建设的全局。如果实行所谓“业务挂帅”，实际上就会让形形色色的资产阶级思想挂帅，就会让个人主义、本位主义、消极疲沓、铺张浪费等等挂了帅。其结果，工作肯定干不好，还会出坏人坏事，会走上邪路，甚至让阶级敌人有机会施展其“和平演变”的阴谋。政治挂帅与业务挂帅之争，本质上是无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想之争，在有些单位，是两条道路、两条路线之争，是把一个单位搞成个什么性质的单位之争，是把队伍带到什么道路上去之争，对这个问题，必须要有清醒的认识。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，必须加强党的建设。为此，必须照党章规定的标准，积极地、较多地、慎重地接受新党员。必须按照德才兼备的方针，坚决地、放手地、逐步地培养提拔新生力量，培养又红又专的无产阶级革命接班人。必须进一步加强支部建设，坚持发扬毛泽东同志提出的理论和实践相结合；密切联系群众；自我批评的三大作风。三大作风是毛泽东同志建党思想的科学概括，是党的建设的根本。支部建设抓住了这一环，就抓住了要领，就能够进一步提高党组织的战斗力，把党的支部真正建设成为坚强的战斗堡垒，使党员更好地用毛泽东思想武装起来，更好地发挥模范带头作用，团结广大群众，在三大革命斗争中打更多的胜仗。
