　　Creating Miracles
　　"The spring breeze sways willows ten thousand strands, six hundred and fifty million of China are all like Emperors Yao and Shun."
　　Our Chinese nation is a diligent and brave nation, and our motherland is a country with vast land and abundant resources. Six hundred and fifty million people are a decisive factor in changing our country's "poor and blank" face.
　　Comrade Mao Zedong said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created. Our country has a large population, many discussions, high enthusiasm, and great energy. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we are in high spirits, full of fighting spirit, and high-spirited.
　　Our six hundred and fifty million people are writing the newest and most beautiful words and drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures on the land of our motherland and in our history, creating miracles in the world!
　　Steel warriors in the style of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande are creating miracles, peasants in the style of Dazhai are creating miracles, and workers in the style of Daqing are creating miracles... Our people have the motherland in their hearts and the world in their sights, creating miracles for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.
　　Several articles published today reflect some examples of the thousands upon thousands of miracles created by the thousands upon thousands of Chinese people under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.
　　In our country, women who were doubly oppressed in the old society have soared into the sky; former serfs have become masters and communist fighters. For the sake of the Chinese people and the people of the world, for the sake of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, they are consciously transforming themselves, striving for strength, competing to ride the east wind, advancing a thousand miles a day!

    创奇迹
    “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”
    我们中华民族是勤劳勇敢的民族，我们祖国是地大、物博的国家。六亿五千万人民是改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的一个决定因素。
    毛泽东同志说，在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。我国人多，议论多，热气高，干劲大，用毛泽东思想武装起来，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。
    我们六亿五千万人民，在祖国的土地上，在我们的历史上，写着最新最美的文字，画着最新最美的画图，创造着人间的奇迹！
    雷锋、王杰、麦贤得式的钢铁战士在创造奇迹，大寨式的农民在创造奇迹，大庆式的工人在创造奇迹，……我国人民胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为了中国革命和世界革命在创造奇迹。
    今天发表的几篇文章，反映了千千万万中国人民，在党和毛泽东同志领导下，创造的千千万万奇迹中的一些例子。
    在我们国家里，在旧社会受着双重压迫的妇女飞上了天；过去的农奴作了主人，成为共产主义战士。他们为了中国人民和世界人民，为了中国革命和世界革命，自觉地改造自己，奋发图强，竞乘东风，一日千里！
