    Johnson Administration's Smoke Screen
    By Our Commentator

    Among the deceptive tactics of the Johnson administration's "peace offensive" is a seductive claim called "de-escalation of combat." This argument goes: the U.S. has "suspended" bombing of North Vietnam, and the "Communist side" should "reduce their own military activities." The U.S. is awaiting this "signal." They want to create the illusion that the U.S. is not climbing the ladder of "gradual escalation," but is advancing on the path to seeking "peace."

    This is a smokescreen. The key to solving the Vietnam problem is not some "de-escalation of combat," but the complete withdrawal of the U.S. aggressor troops from South Vietnam. If the Americans don't get out, the Vietnamese people will surely drive them out through combat. To put it in perspective, if a robber breaks into someone's home to murder, the most urgent issue is to stop him from committing violence and to drive him out. What right does the robber have to use killing fewer people as an exchange condition to demand that the homeowner cease resistance?

    This is yet another new trick of blackmail. What does it mean for the "Communist side" to reduce their activities? It means that the people of South Vietnam should weaken and gradually cease their struggle, and that the people of North Vietnam should weaken and gradually cease their support for their southern compatriots. If there is no such "signal," the U.S. will expand the war even more frantically. Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Wheeler, made it clear on January 4 that if the U.S.'s "peace talk" conspiracy fails, he "will definitely recommend" resuming the bombing. U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Greene also openly threatened on the same day that "if the peace offensive fails, more U.S. ground troops will be needed in South Vietnam." Isn't this naked blackmail?

    In reality, the Johnson administration is not unaware that the Vietnamese people will not fall for its "peace talk" trap. U.S. Senator Mansfield recently admitted in his report to Johnson after touring various countries that the "prospect" of achieving a solution "through negotiations" on U.S. terms is "very slim." One cannot help but ask, if this is the case, why is the U.S. still vigorously promoting a "peace offensive"?

    This is because the U.S.'s practice of "gradual escalation" in the war of aggression against Vietnam has aroused widespread condemnation and strong protests. Domestically, the scale of the American people's anti-war movement has exceeded the Johnson administration's expectations; there is also much bickering and disagreement within the U.S. ruling bloc. Internationally, the tide of people from various countries condemning the Johnson administration's aggression against Vietnam is surging; many countries have explicitly expressed opposition to the U.S. expanding the war of aggression; and its allies are also full of doubts, fearing being dragged into the quagmire of the Vietnam War. Under these circumstances, in order to mislead world opinion and confuse the public, the Johnson administration has exhausted its sweet talk about "peace," so that when the war is further "escalated," it can say to the world: I wanted "peace," and the responsibility for the war expanding lies with the other side.

    Even as the Johnson administration launches a "peace offensive" and trumpets "de-escalation of combat," what do people see on and around the South Vietnamese battlefield? New U.S. reinforcements have arrived in South Vietnam, it has launched the largest "mopping-up" operation in the South Vietnamese war, it is carrying out intensive military construction in many places in South Vietnam, it is conducting larger-scale bombing of the Laotian liberated areas, its military provocations against Cambodia are becoming more frequent, and its military deployments in Thailand are being stepped up. Anyone who respects reality cannot help but draw the conclusion that "de-escalation of combat" is complete deception. The Johnson administration is clearing the way for the accelerated "escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam. Its "peace offensive" is merely the prelude to expanding the war.

    The Johnson administration has already climbed many rungs on the "gradual escalation" ladder and is preparing to continue climbing upwards. Therefore, the so-called "de-escalation of combat" theory is actually nothing more than a smokescreen on the U.S. imperialist "gradual escalation" ladder. All peace-loving people must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the Johnson administration's conspiracy to further expand the war.

    约翰逊政府的烟幕弹
    本报评论员
    约翰逊政府发动的“和平攻势”中，有一种蛊惑人心的说法，叫做“战斗降级”。这种论调是：美国“暂停”了对越南北方的轰炸，“共产党方面”应该“减少他们自己的军事活动”，美国正在期待这种“信号”。它们要造成一种假象，似乎美国不是沿着“逐步升级”的阶梯向上爬，而是在沿着谋求“和平”的道路往前走。
    这是一种烟幕弹。要解决越南问题，不是什么“战斗降级”，关键是美国侵略军全部从南越撤走。如果美国人不滚蛋，越南人民一定会用战斗的手段把它赶出去。打个比方，强盗闯进别人家里杀人，最急迫的问题是要制止他行凶，把他打出去。强盗有什么权利用少杀几个人作为交换条件，要求主人停止抵抗？
    这又是讹诈的一种新花样。什么叫做“共产党方面”减少他们的活动呢？这就是要越南南方人民减弱以至逐步停止他们的斗争，要北方人民减弱以至逐步停止他们对南方同胞的支援。如果没有这种“信号”，美国就要更疯狂地扩大战争。美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒一月四日说得明明白白，如果美国的“和谈”阴谋落空，他“肯定将建议”恢复轰炸。美国海军陆战队司令格林在同一天也公开威胁，“如果和平攻势失败的话，在南越将需要更多的美国地面部队。”这不是露骨透顶的讹诈吗？
    实际上，约翰逊政府不是不知道，越南人民是不会上它的“和谈”圈套的。美国参议员曼斯菲尔德最近在周游列国后向约翰逊提出的报告中就承认，要按照美国的条件，“通过谈判”取得解决的
  “前景”是“非常微小”的。人们不能不问，既然如此，美国为什么还要起劲地大搞“和平攻势”呢？
    这是因为，美国在侵越战争中“逐步升级”的做法引起了广泛谴责和强烈抗议。在国内，美国人民反对战争运动的规模，出乎约翰逊政府的意料之外；美国统治集团内部也吵吵嚷嚷，意见不一。在国外，各国人民声讨约翰逊政府侵略越南的浪潮蓬勃高涨；许多国家都明确表示反对美国扩大侵略战争；它的盟国也疑虑重重，害怕被拖进越南战争的泥坑。在这种形势下，为了迷惑世界舆论，混淆视听，约翰逊政府就把“和平”的好话说尽，以便在战争进一步“升级”之时，它可以向全世界说：我是要“和平”的，导致战争扩大的责任是在对方。
    就在约翰逊政府发动“和平攻势”，鼓吹“战斗降级”的时候，人们在南越战场及其周围的地区看到了什么呢？美国新的增援部队到达了南越，它发动了在南越战争中规模最大的“扫荡”，它在南越的许多地方进行紧张的军事施工，它对老挝解放区进行更大规模的轰炸，它对柬埔寨的军事挑衅更加频繁，它在泰国的军事部署在加紧进行。任何尊重现实的人，都不能不得出这样的结论：什么“战斗降级”，完全是欺人之谈。约翰逊政府正在为侵越战争的加快“升级”扫清道路。它的“和平攻势”，只是扩大战争的序幕。
    约翰逊政府在“逐步升级”的阶梯上已经爬了许多级，而且正在准备继续向上爬。因此，所谓“战斗降级”论，实际上不过是美帝国主义“逐步升级”阶梯上的烟幕弹而已。一切爱好和平的人们，必须对约翰逊政府进一步扩大战争的阴谋，保持高度的警惕。
