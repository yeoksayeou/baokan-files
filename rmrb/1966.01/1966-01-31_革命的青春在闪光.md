    Revolutionary Youth Shine
    In Vietnam's anti-American and national salvation struggle, young people are very active. As long as you are with them, understand their lives and struggles, and listen to them express their aspirations, even a brief meeting will make you feel the flame-like enthusiasm ignite your heart.

    A Red Heart for Anti-American and National Salvation
    In North Vietnam, how many young people I met left a lasting impression! Let me start with a small ring! In Quảng Bình, we saw how the People's Army artillery and militia youth were ready to strike at aerial bandits at any time. On the evening of the day we left, several young artillery soldiers came to see us off during a break in the fighting. They gave us a ring made from the wreckage of an airplane. One of the soldiers, named Gian, pointed to the heart-shaped pattern on the ring and said, "This is made by our own hands, please take it as our red heart for anti-American and national salvation, a red heart determined to participate in the 'Three Ready' movement!" His voice sounded so excited and solemn. They were all young people who had just joined the army not long ago. In the torrent of the "Three Ready" movement, they took up glorious positions of combat day and night, and in the ranks of the People's Army, they all tempered themselves into strong steel fighters. This ring embodies their strong will and determination to resist America and save the country. Although this ring is small, it reminds people of the thousands upon thousands of young people singing war songs and taking up new posts, those young people who are "fighting and producing at the same time," those young people who are all over the northern cities and villages, fighting bravely for anti-American and national salvation.

    The "Three Ready" movement, which has swept across the entire North, has aroused a surge of enthusiasm among young people to rise up against America and save the country, and to devote themselves to the current revolutionary struggle. Inheriting the tradition of the youth shock brigades during the anti-French period, many "Anti-American and National Salvation Youth Shock Brigades" have emerged in various places. The young people participating in the shock brigades volunteer to go to the most important and difficult positions, taking on heavy responsibilities. In the most difficult environments, they complete production tasks and persevere in their studies while being ready to join the battle at any time. Young people have been actively requesting to join the shock brigades, viewing them as the front line for dedicating more strength to resisting America and saving the country, and also as a university for tempering themselves into strong revolutionaries. The Youth Shock Brigade can be said to be a good revolutionary furnace for cultivating and training young people's courage, perseverance, and determination.

    Opening Up New Worlds in the Mountains
    The life of a Youth Shock Brigade fighting in the deep mountains and jungles allows us to clearly see this point.

    This team is named after Lê Công Khai, a combat hero who sacrificed in the Điện Biên Phủ campaign. The young people of the Lê Công Khai Shock Brigade are all advancing towards difficulties with the heroic spirit of Lê Công Khai. When these young people, most of whom are only seventeen or eighteen years old, came here, they faced towering mountains, lush vegetation, changeable weather, and many places rarely visited by people. Some team members walked in the rain for several days, stepped onto the mountain slopes, and when they arrived here, they found no houses or stoves. They put down their luggage and began the battle of producing and creating accommodation conditions at the same time. They appeared here in the mountainous area as the first batch of Anti-American and National Salvation Youth Shock Brigade members just a few months ago, but the mountainous area in front of us is already a brand-new scene.

    We followed the shock brigade members to a small team's camp. On the high and low flat grounds newly opened on the hillside, were houses built by them with bamboo and wood. They proudly introduced these shacks, similar to those once lived in by their anti-French predecessors. In front of the house were pushcarts used for their labor. On both sides of the shacks, one side was a volleyball court which also served as an assembly hall, and the other side was a dining hall cum classroom, with tables and chairs made of bamboo strips and wooden boards, which they also made themselves. The mountainside was where they worked. The scorching sun, torrential rain, and the particularly numerous mountain leeches in the mountains, could not stop the shock brigade members from taking root.

    In this march, the most moving thing is the changes in the team members themselves. Some young people were sixteen or seventeen years old, leaving home for the first time. When they first arrived here, they were not only afraid of mountain leeches, but also afraid of the shadows at night and the calls of strange birds in the forest. Female youths accounted for a small half of the team members. They themselves revealed that some people had shed tears at first. However, labor and combat life have enabled both male and female youths to grow rapidly. They have become brave pioneers here. Those originally timid female youths, now even one or two of them dare to go to the forest to work in the middle of the night. In terms of labor skills, there has also been a huge change. When they first came, they could only complete 50% or 60% of the plan. However, the enthusiasm for resisting America and saving the country encouraged them to attack the rocks and hard soil. They proposed to improve tools in the spirit of Nguyễn Văn Trỗi, learn technology, and improve productivity. The team members manufactured their own wheelbarrows, homemade railcars, and bamboo-woven earth shovels and other tools. They gradually reached the output of skilled workers. Some young people even greatly exceeded the plan. Nguyễn Thị Hiền, eighteen years old, was a shy girl, but it was she who changed from carrying earth to using double wooden rails to transport earth, and the amount of earth she completed every day exceeded the quota of skilled workers by a quarter.

    It is here that they cultivate combat spirit. They have blood blisters and calluses on their hands, and strength in their bodies. They fill up the bomb craters at the entrance and beside them and continue to work. They are ready to fight aerial bandits at any time and automatically make up for the working hours taken up by air defense. At the time of our visit, they were launching a new labor competition to commemorate the first anniversary of the sacrifice of Comrade Nguyễn Văn Trỗi. Comrade Nguyễn Quang Thuận, the leader of the shock brigade and deputy secretary of the Party committee, loves these lively young people from the bottom of his heart. He said, "I participated in the youth shock brigade during the anti-French period. Today, being able to help young people grow is the most exciting thing. Now young people understand more principles than we did at that time, and they will become strong fighters."

    However, it should be said that the crucible is by no means limited to the Youth Shock Brigade. The entire "Three Ready" movement, the nationwide struggle against America and for national salvation, is a great crucible for the growth of young people. In all positions of production and combat, there are young people serving as shock forces, and outstanding advanced figures are constantly emerging everywhere. They are active in the front ranks and are tempered in the front ranks. We met so many such young people. They are shock workers in production posts and warriors in air defense battles. In many agricultural cooperatives, the militia youth are shock brigades for rushing to plant and harvest. In many factories, the self-defense force youth are shock brigades for protecting factories and supporting air defense battles.

    In Thanh Hóa province, I met a young worker named Đỗ Xuân Long. This young man is twenty-four years old and is an installation worker in a machine factory. His father sacrificed in the anti-French period for manufacturing ammunition for the revolutionary troops. Đỗ Xuân Long himself served as an engineer in the People's Army for several years. In the "Three Ready" movement, this descendant of a martyr showed his fighting enthusiasm. In production, he is an advanced producer. In serving the battle and defending production, he is an excellent shock worker. When he smiles and introduces how he overcame one bomb and rocket shell after another dropped by American planes, you will be amazed and delighted by the bravery and wisdom of this young man.

    Defeating American Bombs with Wisdom and Courage
    One night last April, the air defense battle near a bridge had just stopped. However, a 350-kilogram bomb dropped by American thieves happened to be wedged in the iron frame of the bridge railing. Moving it would damage the bridge. At this time, Đỗ Xuân Long bravely came out to deal with this bomb. He hung the back of the bomb's tail with a rope, tied a board under the bomb himself, sat on the board, and began to disassemble the bomb. He had disassembled French bombs in the past, and now he overcame American-made bombs with different structures, and pulled the disassembled bomb out of the bridge deck.

    Since then, this shock worker has recorded new merits in the struggle to defeat American bombs. Once, he was sending machines to a place when he encountered American planes bombing. After the enemy planes were driven away, a large bomb was still lying diagonally on the rice bags in the warehouse on the third floor of the rice mill, with the bomb head facing down and the wings hanging on the bags. Moving it or destroying it in place would damage the rice and the building. Đỗ Xuân Long then requested the leaders not to destroy it, and he volunteered to deal with this dangerous guy. The leaders believed that this task was too dangerous and repeatedly advised him not to go. In order to protect state property, he firmly demanded to go. This bomb could explode at any time if it slid down, but he resolutely rushed towards the bomb. He tied the rope to a wooden pillar, and then skillfully fastened the tail of the bomb. In this way, if the bomb's sliding hit other rice bags, there would still be danger, but he calmly and freely turned this bomb into a non-explosive iron block in ten minutes.

    This is the fighting style of a young worker. He charges towards difficulties, forgetting the danger he faces. Dozens of bombs, as well as a batch of cluster bombs and rocket shells, were defeated by him. He also taught many young partners, making them also skilled in dealing with enemy bombs.

    These moving deeds show how strong will and great strength are hidden in the Vietnamese youth. Such young people are good sons and daughters of the people and the pride of the people. Now they are continuing to move forward without satisfaction. Trần Trung Kiên, a young People's Army soldier who has fought against the enemy more than once in the stormy waves of the sea, said when talking about his determination: "I know that I am still young. In the anti-American and national salvation struggle, I have only begun to do something with the old soldiers. I have only one thought in my mind, that is, to strive to be a strong fighter, and to dedicate more strength to the reunification of the motherland, the liberation of the South, and the defeat of American imperialism."

    Tens of thousands of young people in North Vietnam are throwing themselves into the struggle with a revolutionary red heart, and their youth is shining brightly.

    革命的青春在闪光
    在越南抗美救国斗争中，青年人显得非常活跃。只要和他们在一起，了解他们的生活和斗争，听听他们畅述胸怀，哪怕是短暂的会见，你也会感到他们那火焰般的热情点燃了你的心。
    一颗抗美救国的赤心
    在越南北方，我走过的地方，有多少青年使人难忘啊！让我先从一枚小小的戒指说起吧！在广平，我们看到了人民军炮兵和民兵青年们怎样随时准备打击空中强盗的情景。临走的那天傍晚，几个年青的炮兵战士，趁战斗的间歇赶来送我们。他们赠给我们一枚用飞机残骸作成的戒指。其中一位名叫间的战士指着戒指上的心形图案说：“这是我们亲手做的，请把它看作是我们的一颗抗美救国的赤心，一颗坚决参加‘三准备’运动的赤心吧！”他的声音听来是那样激动而又庄严。他们几个都是刚刚入伍不久的青年，在“三准备”的洪流中，他们走上了日日夜夜战斗的光荣岗位，在人民军的行列里，他们都炼成了坚强的钢铁战士。在这枚戒指里，凝结着他们抗美救国的坚强意志和决心。这枚戒指虽小，但它叫人想到的是那唱着战歌走上新岗位的成千上万的青年，是那些“边战斗，边生产”的青年，是那些遍布北方城乡，正为抗美救国而奋勇斗争的青年们。
    在整个北方掀起的“三准备”运动，激起了青年们奋起抗美救国，投身到当前革命斗争中去的热潮。继承了抗法时期青年突击队的传统，各地出现了许多“抗美救国青年突击队”。参加突击队的青年们志愿地奔赴最重要、最困难的岗位，担起重担。他们在最艰苦的环境里，一边完成生产任务和坚持学习，一边时刻准备投入战斗。青年们纷纷要求参加突击队，他们把突击队看作为抗美救国献出更多力量的前线，也把突击队看作使自己锻炼成坚强革命者的大学。青年突击队可以说是培养和锻炼青年们的勇敢、毅力和决心的很好的革命熔炉。
    在崇山峻岭里开辟新天地
    一个战斗在深山丛林地区的青年突击队队员们的生活，使我们清楚地看到这一点。
    这个队是以一个在奠边府战役中牺牲的战斗英雄黎公开的名字命名的。黎公开突击队的青年们，都以黎公开的英勇精神向困难进军。当这些大多只有十七、八岁的青年来到这里的时候，他们面对着的是崇山峻岭，草木丛生，天气多变，许多地方都是人迹罕到的。有些队员冒雨走了几天，踏上了山坡，到这里一看，没有房子，也没有炉灶。他们放下自己的行李挑子，就开始了边生产、边创建住宿条件的战斗生活。他们作为第一批抗美救国青年突击队员出现在这里的山区不过几个月，但是出现在我们眼前的山区已经是一片崭新的景象了。
    我们随着突击队员来到一个小队的营地，在山坡上新辟出的高高低低的一块块平地上，是他们亲手用竹木搭起的房子。他们自豪地介绍这些类似当年抗法前辈曾经住过的棚屋。屋子前面放着他们劳动用的推车。在棚屋两边，一边是排球场也是大会场，另一边是饭厅兼课堂，里面摆着竹条、木板作的桌凳，这也是他们自己作的。山坡那边是他们劳动的地方。烈日、暴雨，加上山中特别多的山蚂蝗，都没有能阻挡突击队员们扎下根来。
    在这场进军中，最动人的却还是队员们本身的变化。有的小青年十六、七岁，第一次离开家，刚到这里的时候，不仅怕山蚂蝗，还怕夜间的黑影和森林里的怪鸟鸣叫。在队员中，女青年占一少半。她们自己还透露了起初有人抹过眼泪。但是，劳动和战斗生活使男女青年们都在迅速成长。他们在这里成为勇敢的闯将。那些原来胆小的女青年，现在哪怕一两个人也敢在深夜到森林里去工作。在劳动本领方面，更有着巨大的变化。他们刚来时，只能完成计划的百分之五十或六十，但是，抗美救国的热情鼓舞他们向山石和硬土进攻，他们提出以阮文追的精神改进工具，学习技术，提高生产率。队员们自己制造了独轮车、土制轨道车和竹编土铲等工具，他们逐渐达到了熟练工人的生产量。有的青年还大大超过了计划。十八岁的阮氏贤，是个害羞的姑娘，但就是她把抬土改为双木轨运土，每日完成的土方要超过熟练工人指标的四分之一。
    就在这里，他们培养着战斗精神。他们手上磨起了血泡和茧子，身上增强了力量。他们填起门口和身旁的炸弹坑，继续劳动。他们随时准备与空中强盗战斗，并且还自动把防空占去的工时补起来。在我们访问的时候，他们正展开为纪念阮文追烈士牺牲一周年的新的劳动竞赛。对这些生龙活虎的青年们，突击队长兼党委副书记阮光顺同志是打心眼里热爱的。他说：“我过去参加过抗法时期的青年突击队，今天能帮助青年们成长，是一件最叫人兴奋的事。现在青年们比我们那时懂得的道理要多，他们会成为坚强的战士。”
    但是，应当说，熔炉决不只是青年突击队。整个“三准备”运动，全国的抗美救国的斗争，就是青年们成长的大熔炉。在生产和战斗的各个岗位上，到处有青年们在担任突击力量，到处不断涌现着出色的先进人物。他们活跃在前列，锻炼在前列。我们遇到多少这样的青年，他们在生产岗位上是突击手，在对空战斗中是勇士。在许多农业合作社里，民兵青年们都是抢种抢收的突击队，在许多工厂里，自卫队青年又是保卫工厂、支援防空战斗的突击队。
    在清化省，我遇到了一位青年工人杜春隆。这个小伙子二十四岁，是机器厂的安装工。他的父亲是在抗法时期为革命部队制造弹药而牺牲的。杜春隆自己在人民军里当过几年工兵。在“三准备”运动中，这个烈士的后代，显示出他的斗争热情。在生产中，他是先进生产者，在为战斗和保卫生产的服务中，他又是出色的突击手。当他笑着介绍自己战胜了美国飞机投下的一颗又一颗炸弹和火箭炮的时候，你会为这个年轻人的勇敢和智慧而惊奇和喜悦。
    用智勇战胜美国炸弹
    去年四月的一个晚上，一座大桥旁的对空战斗刚刚停息。但是，美国飞贼投下的一颗三百五十公斤重的炸弹，正好夹在桥栏杆的铁架上，搬动它，会伤害桥。这时候，杜春隆勇敢地出来对付这颗炸弹。他把炸弹尾巴后面用绳子吊住，自己在炸弹下面绑了块板，坐在板上拆卸起炸弹来。他过去拆卸过法国炸弹，现在他又战胜了美国造的结构不同的炸弹，把拆开的炸弹拉出了桥面。
    这个突击手，从此在战胜美国炸弹的斗争中记下一次次的新功劳。有一次，他送机器到一个地方去，正逢美国飞机进行轰炸。敌机被打走后，有一颗大炸弹还斜躺在碾米厂三楼仓库的米袋上，炸弹头朝下，翅膀挂着袋子。如果搬动或就原处销毁，都会损害米和楼房。杜春隆当时请求领导不要销毁它，他自告奋勇去治这个危险的家伙。领导认为这项任务太危险，再三劝他不要去。为了保卫国家财产，他坚决要求去。这颗炸弹随时有滑下来爆炸的可能，但是，他毅然奔向炸弹。他把绳子结在木柱上，然后敏捷地拴住炸弹的尾巴，这样炸弹的滑动如果碰上别的米袋仍然有危险，但是，他镇静自如地在十分钟内使这颗炸弹变成不炸的铁块。
    这就是一位青年工人的战斗风格。他向困难突击，忘掉了自己面临的危险。几十颗炸弹，还有一批滚珠弹和火箭炮弹，都被他战胜了。他还教会了许多青年伙伴，使他们也成为对付敌人炸弹的能手。
    这些动人事迹说明，蕴藏在越南青年们身上的是多么坚强的意志和巨大的力量。这样的青年，是人民的好儿女，是人民的骄傲。现在他们毫不满足地继续前进。一位在大海的惊涛骇浪中同敌人战斗不止一次的人民军青年战士陈忠坚，在谈到自己决心的时候说：“我知道，我还年青。在抗美救国斗争中，我才开始和老战士一起作了点事情。我的心思只有一个，就是努力作个坚强的战士，为祖国的统一、南方的解放，为打败美帝献出更大的力量。”
    越南北方的成千上万的青年们，正是这样地怀着一颗革命的赤心而投身斗争，他们的青春因而闪发着光华。
