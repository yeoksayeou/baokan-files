    Days Worked and Effectiveness
    In recent years, the number of days that leading comrades of the county committee have participated in labor has generally been increasing. This is a good phenomenon. However, there should be even higher requirements for cadres participating in labor. Some poor and lower-middle peasants say it well: "We don't care how much work they do; what we like is that they stand shoulder to shoulder with us, heart to heart with us, and can understand our concerns." The masses demand that cadres not only work shoulder to shoulder but also discover problems and solve problems, using both their hands and their brains, and not simply pursue how many days they have worked but also look at the effectiveness of their work.

    天数与效果
    县委领导同志参加劳动的天数，这几年一般是逐渐增多的。这是好现象。但是，对于干部参加劳动，还要有更高的要求。一些贫农下中农说的好：“干了多少活我们不在乎，喜欢的是跟我们肩挨肩，心挨心，能了解我们的心事。”群众要求干部不仅要挨肩劳动，还要发现问题解决问题，既动手，又动脑，而不能单纯追求干了多少天活，还要看工作效果。
