    The State Planning Commission, State Economic Commission, and other departments summarized Xinjiang's successful experience and decided to vigorously promote it nationwide.
    The benefits of changing cement from bagged to bulk are: saving a large amount of high-quality timber; reducing cement costs; increasing the mechanization level of cement loading and unloading and labor productivity, reducing the labor intensity of workers; and reducing losses during loading, unloading, and transportation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 8th—Large quantities of cement can be transported directly from cement factories or cement transfer stations to users using specially made transportation tools instead of paper bags. This reform, which is of great significance to increasing production and saving resources, has already achieved remarkable results in Xinjiang.
    Recently, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the State Capital Construction Commission, the Ministry of Materials Management, and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry jointly held an on-site meeting in Urumqi, summarizing Xinjiang's successful experience in implementing bulk cement through various effective measures, and decided to vigorously promote it nationwide.
    Cement is a material used in large quantities in national construction. The amount of paper used for cement packaging is also very large. Packaging one ton of cement requires about six kilograms of packaging paper. This paper is made of good timber such as red pine and white pine. Producing one ton of packaging paper requires 5.5 to 6 cubic meters of timber. At present, the amount of paper bag paper used by China's cement industry to package cement is very large, requiring hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of timber to manufacture each year. Even with so much good timber used, the paper bags produced are still difficult to fully meet the needs of the cement industry. Promoting bulk cement can save a large amount of high-quality timber and use it in areas more urgently needed by the national economy.
    Paper bags and packaging costs account for about 25 percent of the cost of each ton of cement. Vigorously promoting bulk cement can also greatly reduce cement production costs. In Xinjiang, the implementation of bulk cement has saved users hundreds of thousands of yuan in funds within half a year.
    Adopting bulk cement can improve the mechanization level of cement loading and unloading and labor productivity, and reduce the labor intensity of workers. At present, the labor productivity of cement production in China is relatively low, one of the reasons being that the mechanization level of cement loading and unloading operations is not high, and loading and unloading requires many workers. After adopting bulk cement, manual loading and unloading will be replaced by mechanical equipment, thereby realizing the mechanization of cement loading and unloading operations. In the past, Xinjiang Cement Plant's bagged cement averaged 18 tons per person per shift. After changing to bulk, the average was 115 tons per person per shift, increasing efficiency by more than five times, and reducing loading and unloading workers by 80 percent.
    Implementing bulk cement can reduce cement losses. During the loading, unloading, and transportation of bagged cement, the average loss is about two kilograms per hundred kilograms. Bulk cement, on the other hand, can use advanced sealed transportation tools and storage facilities, with an average loss of only half a kilogram per hundred kilograms of cement. Based on this calculation, bulk transport of ten million tons of cement can reduce losses by 220,000 tons of cement, equivalent to the annual output of a medium-sized cement plant.
    Because bulk cement has so many advantages over bagged cement, it has attracted widespread attention in various countries around the world.
    At present, the use of bulk cement in China is still very small. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made significant achievements in this regard due to adhering to putting politics in command and grasping it quickly and tightly, and has created some simple and easy-to-implement methods in the five links of cement loading, transportation, unloading, storage, and use.
    Xinjiang's approach was explored by promoting the spirit of working hard, enduring hardship, and working skillfully. The staff of Xinjiang Cement Plant quickly produced bulk cement equipment without asking the state for a penny. Transportation department employees quickly modified seven types of vehicles using existing cars and waste materials in the absence of dedicated sealed vehicles for bulk cement. Corresponding methods were also adopted for unloading based on different vehicle types. The user departments also attached importance to the overall interests and actively cooperated, building various simple cement storage warehouses according to local conditions. Some water conservancy construction departments, in accordance with the decentralized characteristics of small-scale water conservancy projects, used river pebbles to build material pits on the construction site or used earth blocks to build cement pools to store cement. Many construction sites also made various mobile or manual transportation tools to transport cement for ease of use.
    Currently, bulk cement in Xinjiang accounts for more than 37 percent of all cement shipped from the factory.
    Xinjiang's practice shows that although the implementation of bulk cement involves a wide range of issues and many problems, as long as all departments adhere to putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, fully develop the wisdom of the masses, and be brave in revolution and creation, this new measure of great significance can be rapidly promoted.
    This meeting fully studied how to vigorously promote bulk cement nationwide and proposed specific measures.

### 实行水泥散装　有利增产节约

    实行水泥散装　有利增产节约
    国家计委、经委等部门总结新疆成功经验，决定在全国大力推广
    改水泥袋装为散装的好处是：节约大量优质木材；降低水泥成本；提高水泥的装卸机械化水平和劳动生产率，减轻工人的劳动强度；减少装卸和运输过程中的损失
    新华社乌鲁木齐八日电大宗水泥可以不用纸袋包装，而改用专制运输工具直接从水泥厂或水泥中转站运送到使用单位。这项对增产节约有重大意义的改革，已经在新疆取得显著成效。
    最近，国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、国家基本建设委员会、物资管理部和建筑材料工业部，在乌鲁木齐联合召开现场会议，总结了新疆采取多种有效措施实行水泥散装的成功经验，决定在全国大力推广。
    水泥在国家建设中是用量很大的一项物资。水泥包装用纸量也很大。包装一吨水泥，需要六公斤左右的包装纸。这种纸都是用红松、白松等好木材生产的。生产一吨包装纸要用五点五到六立方米木材。目前我国水泥工业用来包装水泥的纸袋纸数量很大，每年需要用几十万立方米木材来制造。即使用了这样多的好木材，生产出来的纸袋仍然难以充分满足水泥工业的需要。推广散装水泥就可以节约出大量优质木材，用在国民经济更加急需的方面。
    在每吨水泥的成本中，纸袋和包装费用约占百分之二十五左右。大力推广散装水泥还可以大大地降低水泥生产成本。新疆地区由于实行了水泥散装，在半年之内就为用户节省了几十万元资金。
    采用散装水泥可以提高水泥的装卸机械化水平和劳动生产率，减轻工人的劳动强度。目前，我国水泥生产的劳动生产率较低，原因之一是水泥装卸作业机械化水平不高，装卸占用工人多。采用散装水泥以后，人工装卸将被机械设备所代替，从而实现水泥装卸作业机械化。新疆水泥厂过去袋装水泥平均每班每人装十八吨，改为散装后，平均每班每人可装一百一十五吨，提高工效五倍以上，装卸工人减少百分之八十。
    实行散装水泥可以减少水泥的损失。袋装水泥在装、卸运输过程中，一般平均每百公斤约损失两公斤左右。而散装水泥，可采用先进的密封运输工具和储存设施，平均每百公斤水泥只损失半公斤。以此计算，散装一千万吨水泥，就可以少损失二十二万吨水泥，相当于一个中型水泥厂一年的产量。
    由于散装水泥比袋装具有这么多的优越性，因此引起了世界各国的普遍重视。
    目前，我国采用散装水泥的还很少。新疆维吾尔自治区在这方面由于坚持政治挂帅，抓得快，抓得紧，已经做出了显著成绩，在水泥的装、运、卸、储、用五个环节上都创造出了一些简便易行的办法。
    新疆这套办法是发扬穷干、苦干、巧干的精神摸索出来的。新疆水泥厂的职工，在没有向国家要一文钱的情况下，迅速制作了散装水泥设备。运输部门职工在没有水泥散装专用密封车的情况下，利用原有的汽车和废旧材料，迅速改装了七种车型。在卸车方面，根据不同车型，也采取了相应的方法。使用部门也以整体利益为重，大力配合，因地制宜地建设了各种简易的水泥储存仓库。有些水利建设部门按照小型水利工程分散的特点，在工地上利用河卵石砌成料坑或以土块砌筑水泥池等办法来储存水泥。许多工地为了方便使用，还制作了各种机动的或人力的运送工具来运输水泥。
    目前，新疆实行散装的水泥已经占全部出厂水泥的百分之三十七以上。
    新疆的实践表明：虽然实行水泥散装，牵涉面广，涉及问题多，但是只要各个部门坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，充分发扬群众的智慧，勇于革命，勇于创造，这个具有重大意义的新措施是可以迅速推广的。
    这次会议对如何在全国大力推广散装水泥问题作了充分研究，并且提出了具体的措施。
