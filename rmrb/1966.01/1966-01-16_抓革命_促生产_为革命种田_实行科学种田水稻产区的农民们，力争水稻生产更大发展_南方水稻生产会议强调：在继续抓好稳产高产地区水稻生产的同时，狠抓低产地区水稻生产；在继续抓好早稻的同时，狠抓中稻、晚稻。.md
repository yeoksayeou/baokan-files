    Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, Farm for Revolution
　  Farmers in Rice-Producing Areas Implement Scientific Farming, Striving for Greater Development in Rice Production
    Southern Rice Production Conference Emphasizes: While Continuing to Focus on Rice Production in Stable and High-Yielding Areas, Vigorously Focus on Rice Production in Low-Yielding Areas; While Continuing to Focus on Early Rice, Vigorously Focus on Intermediate and Late Rice.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 15) The Southern Rice Production Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out: While continuing to focus on rice production in stable and high-yielding areas, vigorously focus on rice production in low-yielding areas; while continuing to focus on early rice, vigorously focus on intermediate and late rice; this is an important task for rice-producing areas during the Third Five-Year Plan. The conference called on the vast number of cadres and commune members in rice-producing areas to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of Dazhai, and strive for greater development in rice production during the Third Five-Year Plan.
    This conference, which summarized and exchanged experiences in rice production and studied the further development of rice production, was held in Foshan City, Guangdong Province.  Attending the conference were cadres from relevant departments and agricultural scientific and technical personnel from thirteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the South. Vice Premier of the State Council Tao Zhu attended the meeting and made an important speech.
    Rice production occupies an extremely important position in China's grain production. It is China's main and high-yielding grain crop.  The proportion of sown area in the total area of ​​grain crops in the country is not large, but the total annual output accounts for a large proportion of the total grain output in the country. Therefore, the success or failure of rice production has a decisive impact on the increase or decrease of the country's total grain output.
    The information gathered at the meeting showed that in recent years, the national rice production situation has improved year by year, and rice yields in many regions have increased substantially year after year. This is because all localities have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implemented the Party's principles and policies; taken class struggle as the key link, launched in-depth socialist education movement, and grasped revolution and promoted production; taken Dazhai as an example, carried out the movement of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping and surpassing, and promoted the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions. By 1965, the number of counties in rice-producing areas whose grain yield per mu reached or exceeded the targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" not only increased by nearly 90 percent compared with 1964, but also several special zones achieved grain yields per mu that reached or exceeded the targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program." At the same time, a number of units emerged that rapidly transformed from low yield to high yield, achieved higher yields from high yields, achieved large-scale, substantial, and sustained yield increases, and achieved high-yield abundance. This excellent situation has not only accelerated the growth rate of China's overall grain production, but also showcased a broad prospect for the further development of rice production in the future.
    The meeting analyzed that the most prominent problems in current rice production are: unbalanced and unstable production development. Between regions, the gap between low yield and high yield is very large, and the area of ​​basically stable and high-yielding paddy fields is small, while the area of ​​stable but not high yield and unstable yield is large. Among the various seasons of rice, the increase in early rice is larger, and the yield is relatively stable and high; the increase in intermediate and late rice is smaller, and in most areas, the yield of late rice is neither stable nor high. According to this situation, the meeting determined that in the future work of developing rice production, two-pronged approaches should be implemented. It is necessary to continue to focus on rice production in stable and high-yielding areas, and vigorously focus on rice production in low-yielding areas; it is necessary to continue to focus on early rice production, and vigorously focus on intermediate and late rice production. This is to ensure that the total rice yield increases year by year according to plan during the Third Five-Year Plan.
    The meeting pointed out that although the area of ​​basic stable and high-yielding rice areas is small, its yield accounts for an important proportion of the total rice yield, and the grain commodity rate is high. Therefore, these areas must continue to adhere to grasping revolution and promoting production, carry forward the spirit of Dazhai, rely on their own efforts, and struggle hard; farm for the revolution, implement scientific farming; further tap the potential for increasing production, make rice yield even higher, and continue to become a national model of high rice yield and an important base for commodity grain.
    After analyzing the situation in low-yield areas, the meeting pointed out: To grasp low-yield areas, it is also necessary to have a focus. The focus should be on areas with a high grain commodity rate. Generally speaking, the potential for increasing production in these low-yield areas is greater than in high-yield areas. As long as the work catches up, its appearance can be gradually changed, making a huge contribution to completing the grain production tasks during the Third Five-Year Plan.
    The meeting pointed out that most of the low-yield areas are hilly and mountainous areas. Changing the low-yield appearance of hilly and mountainous areas, developing production in hilly and mountainous areas, and further improving the lives of the people in hilly and mountainous areas not only have huge economic significance, but also have great political significance. The meeting demanded that leading departments at all levels must immediately put this matter on the important agenda.
    How to change the appearance of rice production in low-yield areas? According to the experience of some advanced units, the meeting pointed out: Carrying forward the spirit of Dazhai, working hard, working diligently, working practically, and working skillfully, relying on one's own efforts to carry out large-scale farmland capital construction, changing the natural appearance, and creating basic conditions for stable and high rice yield is a major way. The Jiangxi Province Yujiang County and Fujian Province Changtai County and other typical examples of transformation from low yield to high yield introduced at the meeting followed such roads. In order to accelerate the development of rice production in low-yield areas, the meeting also required agricultural scientific and technical forces to go to the mountains, run three-way combination demonstration fields, and help these areas gradually change the backward conditions of production and farming technology.
    The meeting pointed out that while grasping rice production in the southern rice-producing areas, it is also necessary to grasp the production of grain crops such as wheat, corn, potatoes, and beans, which account for about half of the total sown area of ​​grain crops in these areas. At the same time, it is also necessary to develop diversified operations. The meeting believes that only in this way can the agricultural production in rice-producing areas be comprehensively developed; the comprehensive development of agricultural production will in turn inevitably promote and guarantee the further improvement of rice yield.
    The meeting emphasized that whether it is to change the production appearance of low-yield areas and intermediate and late rice, or whether it is to strive for higher yields in stable and high-yield areas, the key lies in leadership. As long as the leadership emphasizes politics, mobilizes the positive factors of people, does not shrink back in the face of difficulties, does not become complacent in the face of high yields, dares to make revolution, and is good at making revolution, it can push forward the work of developing rice production in various types of areas. The meeting required all localities to combine revolutionary spirit with scientific attitude, to be vigorous and steady. Hard work and arduous effort must be put into farmland capital construction, but it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and be realistic and pragmatic. While doing a good job in current production, it is necessary to proceed in stages and batches, act according to one's capabilities. It is necessary to actively promote technological reforms, humbly learn from advanced experiences from other places, but also combine them with the specific conditions of the local area, test everything, and gradually promote it. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to engage in production and construction, but it is also necessary to seriously implement policies, promote democracy, follow the mass line, respect the autonomy of production teams, care about the lives of the masses, and adhere to the combination of work and rest. It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and studies, grasp the situation in a timely manner, and establish the idea that "man will conquer nature"; but it is also necessary to look at the worst possible situation, strive for the best, make two preparations, and two arrangements, to strive for the initiative.
    The meeting also conducted a serious summary of the scientific and technological experience of rice production. In order to guarantee another good rice harvest in 1966, the meeting studied and deployed the various seasonal production and spring plowing preparation work in the rice-producing areas in 1966. The meeting called on the vast number of cadres and commune members in the rice-producing areas to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of Dazhai, further carry out the movement of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping and surpassing, and strive for a bumper harvest of rice production in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan and make a good start.

    抓革命　促生产　为革命种田
　  实行科学种田水稻产区的农民们，力争水稻生产更大发展
    南方水稻生产会议强调：在继续抓好稳产高产地区水稻生产的同时，狠抓低产地区水稻生产；在继续抓好早稻的同时，狠抓中稻、晚稻。
    据新华社广州十五日电　农业部最近召开的南方水稻生产会议指出：在继续抓好稳产高产地区水稻生产的同时，狠抓低产地区的水稻生产；在继续抓好早稻的同时，狠抓中稻、晚稻；这是水稻产区在第三个五年计划期间的重要任务。会议号召水稻产区的广大干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬大寨精神，力争水稻生产在第三个五年计划期间有一个更大的发展。
    这次总结、交流水稻生产经验和研究进一步发展水稻生产的会议，是在广东省佛山市举行的。参加会议的有南方十三个省、市、自治区的有关部门干部和农业科学技术人员。国务院副总理陶铸到会作了重要讲话。
    水稻生产在我国粮食生产中占有极为重要的地位。它是我国主要的又是高产的粮食作物，播种面积在全国粮食作物总面积中所占的比例不大，而常年总产量却在全国粮食总产量中占有较大的比重。因此，水稻生产的丰歉，对全国粮食总产量的增减，具有举足轻重的影响。
    会议汇集的情况表明，近几年来，全国水稻生产形势一年比一年好，许多地区水稻产量连年大幅度增长。这是由于各地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻执行党的方针政策；以阶级斗争为纲，深入开展社会主义教育运动，抓革命促生产；以大寨为榜样，开展比学赶帮超运动，因地制宜地推行农业“八字宪法”的结果。到一九六五年，水稻产区粮食亩产量达到或超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定指标的县，不仅比一九六四年增加了将近百分之九十，而且还有好几个专区粮食亩产量达到或超过了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标，同时，还出现了一批低产迅速变高产、高产更高产、大面积大幅度持续增产和高额丰产的单位。这种大好形势，既加快了我国整个粮食生产的增长速度，又为今后水稻生产的进一步发展，展示了一个广阔的前景。
    会议分析，当前水稻生产中最突出的问题是：生产发展不平衡、不稳定。在地区之间，低产和高产的差距很大，而且基本稳产高产的稻田面积小，产量稳而不高和不高不稳的面积大。在各季水稻之间，早稻增产幅度较大，产量较稳较高；中稻、晚稻增产幅度较小，而且多数地区晚稻产量既不稳又不高。根据这种情况，会议确定，在今后发展水稻生产的工作中，要实行两个两手抓。既要继续抓好稳产高产地区的水稻生产，又要狠抓低产地区的水稻生产；既要继续抓好早稻生产，又要狠抓中稻、晚稻生产。以保证水稻总产量在第三个五年计划期间按计划逐年增长。
    会议指出，水稻基本稳产高产地区虽然面积小，但它的产量却在水稻总产量中占有重要的比重，而且粮食商品率高。因此，这些地区今后必须继续坚持抓革命促生产，发扬大寨精神，自力更生、艰苦奋斗；为革命种田，实行科学种田；进一步发挥增产潜力，使水稻高产再高产，继续成为全国水稻高产样板和重要的商品粮基地。
    会议分析了低产地区的情况以后指出：抓低产地区也要有重点。重点应该是粮食商品率高的地区。一般说，这些低产区的增产潜力比高产区更大，只要工作赶上去，就可以逐步改变它的面貌，为完成第三个五年计划期间的粮食生产任务做出巨大贡献。
    会议指出，低产区又多数是丘陵山区，改变丘陵山区的低产面貌，发展丘陵山区的生产，进一步改善丘陵山区人民的生活，不仅有巨大的经济意义，也有重大的政治意义。会议要求各级领导部门必须把这件事立即提到重要的议事日程上来。
    怎样改变低产地区的水稻生产面貌？会议根据一些先进单位的经验指出：发扬大寨精神，穷干、苦干、实干、巧干，自力更生地大搞农田基本建设，改变自然面貌，为水稻稳产高产创造基本条件，是一条主要途径。会议上介绍的江西省余江县和福建省长泰县等一批由低产变高产的典型，就是走的这样的道路。为了加速发展低产地区的水稻生产，会议还要求农业科学技术力量上山，大办三结合的样板田，帮助这些地区逐步地改变生产条件和耕作技术落后的状况。
    会议指出，南方水稻产区在抓好水稻生产的同时，还必须抓好占这些地区粮食作物播种总面积一半左右的麦类、玉米、薯类、豆类等粮食作物的生产，同时，还要发展多种经营。会议认为，只有这样，水稻产区的农业生产才会得到全面发展；农业生产的全面发展，反过来又必然促进和保证水稻产量的进一步提高。
    会议强调指出：不论是改变水稻低产地区和中稻、晚稻的生产面貌，也不论是稳产高产地区争取再高产，关键在于领导。只要领导突出政治，调动人的积极因素，在困难面前不畏缩，在高产面前不自满，敢于革命，善于革命，就能把各类地区发展水稻生产的工作推向前进。会议要求各地必须把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，干劲要大，步子要稳。在农田基本建设上要下苦工夫、笨工夫，但又要因地制宜，实事求是，在搞好当前生产的同时，分期分批，量力而行。要积极推行技术改革，虚心学习外地先进经验，但又要同本地的具体情况结合起来，一切经过试验，逐步推广。要发动群众搞生产建设，但又必须严肃认真地执行政策，发扬民主，走群众路线，尊重生产队的自主权，要关心群众生活，坚持劳逸结合。要深入调查研究，及时掌握情况，树立“人定胜天”思想；但又要从最坏处着眼，向最好处努力，作两手准备，两套安排，力争主动。
    会议还对水稻生产的科学技术经验，进行了认真的总结。为了保证一九六六年水稻继续丰收，会议对水稻产区各季生产和一九六六年春耕生产的各项准备工作，进行了研究，做了部署。会议号召水稻产区的广大干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬大寨精神，进一步开展比学赶帮超运动，力争第三个五年计划第一年的水稻生产获得大丰收，打响第一炮。（附图片）
