    Wholeheartedly Serving the People, Relying on the People in Everything
    —The Yujiang County Party Committee's Struggle to Change the Face of Production by Relying on the Masses
    Eight years ago, the people of Yujiang County, Jiangxi, created a miracle in the history of world medicine by eliminating schistosomiasis. Our great leader Chairman Mao wrote a brilliant poem for this—"Farewell to the God of Plague, Two Poems." The people of Yujiang have not failed Chairman Mao's concern and the expectations of the people of the whole country. They have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and after many years of hard work, diligent work, practical work, and ingenious work, they have changed the drought-stricken and low-yielding face of Yujiang. In 1965, the county's grain yield per mu reached the target of the "National Agricultural Development Program," and the total output exceeded more than double that of the liberation period, becoming a red flag in the southern region for changing low yields to high yields. In the early days of liberation, this county still had to eat state-supplied grain, but in 1965, the marketable grain provided to the state reached more than 200 jin per mu of grain land.
    How did the Yujiang County Party Committee lead the people of Yujiang through this difficult journey?
    Conscientiously act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly serve the people, and rely on the people in everything. This is the answer of the comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee.
  Worry about what the people worry about,
    Do what the people want to do
    To change the face of production in a county, the County Party Committee, as the battle headquarters, must have a completely and thoroughly people-serving ideology. Under the guidance of this ideology, the comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee have, over the years, insisted on going deep into the countryside, sharing weal and woe with the people, understanding the people's wishes and demands, being anxious about what they are anxious about, worrying about what they are worried about, and doing everything possible to do what they ask to do.
    What is it that the people of Yujiang urgently want to do? In the early days of liberation, besides the cruel feudal exploitation, drought and schistosomiasis, like two sharp swords, hung over the heads of the people of Yujiang, threatening their survival. Although Yujiang County is south of the Yangtze River, due to drought, grain production is very low, and the people eat miscellaneous grains and sweet potatoes. The devastating schistosomiasis is also prevalent in the central part of Yujiang, taking the lives of thousands of people, exterminating dozens of villages, and leaving tens of thousands of mu of land desolate.
    Therefore, the people of Yujiang urgently demand social reform and urgently demand to drive away the drought demon and the disease demon.
    With deep class feelings, the comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee firmly grasped the urgent demands of the people of Yujiang, grasped class struggle with one hand and the struggle for production with the other. They firmly led the Yujiang peasants to eliminate feudal exploitation and take the socialist road, and also firmly led the Yujiang peasants to carry out the struggle to drive away the drought demon and the disease demon.
    In the winter of 1950, while carrying out the anti-hegemony struggle, the Yujiang County Party Committee mobilized thousands of farmers from the county to come to the banks of the Baita River to build the Jiefang Dam and the Baita Canal. They worked continuously for five winters and springs, building two dam heads and repairing more than 300 li of main and branch canals, diverting the Baita River water to irrigate 80,000 to 90,000 mu of arid land on the east and west banks.
    In order to eliminate schistosomiasis, which threatened the lives of more than 30,000 people in some areas of Yujiang, although there was no precedent in the history of world medicine for completely eliminating this disease, the comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee, with the belief that "we communists are here to relieve the people's suffering," together with medical personnel, went deep into the epidemic areas, investigated and studied, painstakingly studied, and repeatedly experimented, and found an effective method of combining Chinese and Western medicine to treat schistosomiasis. By 1958, they finally sent away the plague god of schistosomiasis.
    The two things, repairing the Baita Canal and sending away the plague god, greatly enhanced the people of Yujiang's feelings for the Party and strengthened the people of Yujiang's belief in daring to struggle and daring to change their own destiny.
    "Spring breeze caresses thousands of willow branches, Six hundred million in China are all like Yao and Shun." Chairman Mao's verses in "Farewell to the God of Plague" further inspired the Yujiang County Party Committee and the people of Yujiang. The Yujiang County Party Committee's ideology of serving the people and relying on the people became more conscious, and the confidence in changing the face of Yujiang became more firm. The County Party Committee formulated a strategic plan to transform the low-yielding face of Yujiang—highlighting the solution of the drought problem, building water conservancy projects every year, and doing one or two major things to change production conditions every year. They adhered to the principle of combining long-term interests with current interests, paid attention to economic results, and were determined to do one thing and succeed in one thing, striving to have most of the projects start construction and benefit in the same year, taking one step at a time, and always maintaining a strong morale.
    From the beginning of 1951, for fifteen years, the Yujiang County Party Committee relied on the masses to build more than 1,100 large and small water conservancy projects, building a water conservancy network that irrigated 95 percent of the county's farmland (irrigating an area of more than 300,000 mu) on the basis of almost no water conservancy facilities (only more than 10,000 mu of irrigated area before liberation), of which more than 70 percent could resist drought for more than 70 days; all the barren red soil was planted with green manure red flower grass; and double-cropping rice was developed from 600 mu in the early days of liberation to 220,000 mu.
    For the sake of the people, relying on the people to persist in hard work for fifteen years, the face of Yujiang has greatly changed. The former epidemic area is now a stable and high-yielding center with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. The former schistosomiasis patients are now labor models and tractor drivers. The former "coffin fields" are now breeding experimental fields in state-owned farms. The former low-yielding county that ate chaff and wild vegetables is now an advanced county like Dazhai.
    Rely on the people to strive for their own interests
    For the sake of the people, we must rely on the people and rely on the people to strive for their own interests. The Yujiang County Party Committee has always acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings.
    In the past few years, Yujiang suffered from three consecutive years of natural disasters. In this situation, should we or can we continue to carry out farmland capital construction appropriately? At that time, there were many arguments for fearing difficulties and retreating, but what did the broad masses think? The comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee went deep into the masses to investigate and study. They found that some middle peasants with a better life advocated that all water conservancy should be stopped, more sideline occupations should be carried out, and more cash should be distributed; the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely stated that only by enduring hardship in the present can we exchange for the happiness of future generations, and if Yujiang wants to turn over, it must build water conservancy. The Yujiang County Party Committee analyzed the different opinions of different masses from the perspective of class analysis. Obviously, the voices of the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants reflected the fundamental interests of the people of Yujiang. The County Party Committee believed that we must firmly believe in the majority of the masses, resolutely lead the masses to persist in the struggle to transform nature, and try our best to save time, benefit the people of Yujiang as early as possible, and contribute more to the country and the people of the world as early as possible. In the most difficult years, the Yujiang County Party Committee led the masses, proceeded from reality, and actively and step by step gradually matched the water conservancy projects that were fully launched in 1958, benefiting from them year by year, and also completing one or two medium-sized water conservancy projects every year. They also relied on the masses to be self-reliant, promoted green manure, and established a system for breeding improved varieties.
    In 1963, Yujiang won a harvest in the year of severe drought that exceeded the best years in the past, which proved that under the leadership of the Party, through unremitting efforts, the production conditions had been basically changed and the ability to resist disasters had been greatly enhanced. At this time, the comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee considered: Can we continue to leap forward to a new height in 1964? How is the enthusiasm of the masses? We must go to the masses and go to practice to understand. Many comrades found in their stay that in some places, water conservancy was not up to par in the past, and the masses were never so bold in investing fertilizer and labor, for fear that a drought would lead to more effort with less results; now that water conservancy has been solved, the masses are trying every means to get more fertilizer and invest more labor, and production has increased substantially. In some places, the method of "changing the late to early and expanding double-cropping rice," which had failed in the past, was picked up again, and the yield per mu increased by 200 to 300 jin per year. In some places, only one "Zhechang No. 9" variety was changed for late rice, and the yield per mu also increased by 50 to 100 jin. What do these situations illustrate? It shows that there is great socialist enthusiasm hidden in the masses, and this enthusiasm should be organized into new struggles in a timely manner.
    The comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee understood that to push production to a new height, it is not only necessary to have material conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil, but the most basic thing is to rely on the masses, rely on the masses to strive for their own interests, and rely on the experience gained by the masses in practice. The County Party Committee led a large number of cadres to go deep into the production teams and launched a massive propaganda movement. Chairman Mao's brilliant poems written for the people of Yujiang became the best teaching material for the Yujiang County Party Committee to conduct class education among the people. The people of Yujiang looked back on the tragic past and looked forward to the bright future, and were determined to quickly remove the hat of low yield in order to answer Chairman Mao's concern and expectations. The County Party Committee helped the masses classify and rank by commune, team, slope, and mound to find gaps and tap potential, and further implemented the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the county into measures to increase production.
    This year, the work of the County Party Committee was very intensive, and political and ideological work, production increase measures, and operation and management were comprehensively grasped one link after another. The climate was still good in the first half of the year, but a flood in July flooded a lot of the grain that was about to be harvested. At that time, the comrades of the County Party Committee were quite nervous; but they quickly calmed down. They thought, is a flood a bad thing or can it be turned into a good thing? After careful analysis: the water is large, and the reservoir has stored more water, so we can grow more second-season late rice. The County Party Committee immediately pointed out this favorable condition to the masses and mobilized everyone's enthusiasm again. The original plan was to plant 150,000 mu of second-season late rice, but 180,000 mu were planted, and management was strengthened, and the second-season late rice increased by 80% compared with the previous year. In 1964, the grain yield per mu reached 617 jin, an increase of 40% compared with 1963.
    In the face of such a great victory, some cadres had the idea of taking a break, thinking that it would be about the same if we could maintain the status quo in 1965. The Yujiang County Party Committee promptly organized everyone to study the article "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," guiding everyone to use the method of "one divides into two" to view the situation in the county: although 90% of the county's people have eaten fragrant rice; however, there are still some dead corners of water conservancy in the hills and mountainous areas (exactly where the old revolutionary base areas were located), where the masses are still eating sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains... Yujiang's production struggle is still very arduous, and the leadership responsibility of the County Party Committee is still very arduous. Learning aroused everyone's fighting spirit and enhanced everyone's revolutionary sense of responsibility. Everyone was determined: we must solve the water conservancy problems in the old revolutionary base areas, we must let the people in the old revolutionary base areas eat the rice they grow themselves, we must take down Yujiang's largest water conservancy project—the Baita New Canal, and on the basis of the county's grain yield per mu of 600 jin, "cross the Yangtze River" in victory.
    There were, of course, many difficulties. The difficulties were concentrated in the forty days before the rush harvest and rush planting. At this time, it was the hot summer season in June and July, the weather was hot, there were many mosquitoes, and 13,000 laborers in the county were rushing to repair regulating reservoirs, filling projects, and the main canal, and the amount of labor was very large. If these more than 10,000 strong laborers get tired and sick, the water conservancy project will not be taken down, and it will affect the rush harvest and rush planting even more. The Secretary of the County Party Committee, the County Head, and others all came to the front line. They first grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works, organized the laborers to study "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," and launched a discussion on "Farming for the Revolution, and building water conservancy is also for the Revolution." They were very concerned about the lives of the laborers, transferred a large number of medical personnel from the county to vigorously promote environmental sanitation; transferred a large number of fresh vegetables and pork to ensure that the laborers ate well and slept soundly. The Secretary of the County Party Committee carried soil with the laborers during the day and checked the bunks in the work shed at night. As a result, a large number of iron shoulders appeared on the construction site, and the laborers shouted the slogan "Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, everyone acts as a new Foolish Old Man," picked up the soil baskets, and ran forward. The project quality was good, the progress was fast, the main projects were taken down on time, and there were no sick people.
    It was in this way that the Yujiang County Party Committee, for the interests of the people, enlightened and relied on the people to strive for their own interests, and took down the Baita New Canal project, which could expand the irrigation of 50,000 mu of land, and irrigated 30,000 mu in the same year, so that the people in the old revolutionary base areas finally ate the rice they grew themselves, and Yujiang County became one of the first advanced counties in Jiangxi to cross the Yangtze River in terms of mu yield in 1965.
    Persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong
    In more than ten years of fighting, the Yujiang County Party Committee has continuously transformed its own subjective world while transforming the objective world. Their work has always been busy and intensive, but what overrides everything in the guiding ideology of the County Party Committee is to continuously arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and arm the cadres of the county and the people of Yujiang with Mao Zedong Thought. The County Party Committee studies Chairman Mao's works very seriously, and the Standing Committee has a central study group, with the Secretary of the County Party Committee as the leader, learning what to do and learning with questions. The Standing Committee can often carry out criticism and self-criticism and persist in organizational life. When arranging a central task, from the County Party Committee to the grassroots, they often use Mao Zedong Thought to check and examine. It is precisely because they listen to Chairman Mao's words everywhere and act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions at all times that their viewpoint of serving whom is very clear, and they know their obligations and responsibilities. Therefore, they try every means to do what the masses ask them to do, and they can persist in what is good for the interests of the people and correct what is wrong for the interests of the people.
    The Yujiang County Party Committee has also experienced setbacks and failures on the road of progress for the people. That was in 1958, when the Yujiang County Party Committee, eager to change the low-yielding face, launched more than 30 water conservancy projects in the county at once. There was not enough labor, and many projects were only half-finished. The county also generally expanded the planting of double-cropping rice when the conditions for water, fertilizer, and soil were not up to par. As a result, the yield of two seasons was not as high as the yield of one season for a considerable part. The masses had a lot of opinions. At that time, some cadres were discouraged, worked with small hands and feet, and even had a mental state of "once bitten by a snake, three years afraid of grass ropes." The Yujiang County Party Committee conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works, their minds became clear, and they confidently told everyone: "We have not grasped the objective laws of things, and we have encountered setbacks in our work. But this is temporary, and the important thing is that our thinking cannot fail." The County Party Committee organized all cadres to restudy Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," correctly summarized the experiences and lessons in their work, did not blindly negate everything, did not associate it with personal success or failure, and resolutely did what Chairman Mao taught, persisted in what was good for the interests of the people, and corrected what was wrong for the interests of the people. The County Party Committee, in connection with the situation in Yujiang, made everyone realize that: building water conservancy over the years is correct, the mistake is that the project surface is too large in one year, and in the future, we must persist in building water conservancy, but we must do one thing and succeed in one thing. Changing late fields to early fields, changing dry fields to paddy fields, and changing single seasons to double seasons are also not wrong in direction, the mistake is that we have greatly changed when the conditions for water and fertilizer have not been met. Therefore, the important thing is to create conditions for water and fertilizer. It was in this way that the Yujiang County Party Committee turned failure and setbacks into useful experiences for striving for success, and continued to lead the people of the county to carry out the struggle to transform nature in a down-to-earth manner in accordance with the spirit of "great enthusiasm and steady steps," and finally achieved great success.
    The comrades of the Yujiang County Party Committee are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. They are determined to work hard in the future to ensure that: they will not be knocked down by achievements, they will not be overwhelmed by heavy tasks, they will not be overwhelmed by many difficulties, and they will not be knocked down by criticism when mistakes occur in their work. With such determination and courage, it can be believed that the future work of Yujiang County will be like the rising sun, radiating more light and heat for the people and for socialism!

### 一心为人民  一切靠人民——余江县委依靠群众改变生产面貌的斗争

    一心为人民  一切靠人民
    ——余江县委依靠群众改变生产面貌的斗争
    江西余江县人民，八年前创造了世界医学史上的奇迹，消灭了血吸虫病。我们伟大的领袖毛主席为此写下了光辉的诗篇——送瘟神二首。余江人民没有辜负毛主席的关怀和全国人民的期望。他们发扬自力更生、艰苦创业的革命精神，连续多年苦干、穷干、实干、巧干，改变了余江干旱低产的面貌。一九六五年全县粮食亩产达到《全国农业发展纲要》的指标，总产量超过解放时两倍多，成为南方地区低产变高产的一面红旗。这个县在解放初期还要吃国家的供应粮，而一九六五年给国家提供的商品粮，每亩粮田达到了二百多斤。
    余江县委是怎样领导余江人民跨过这一艰难征程的呢？
    认真按照毛主席的指示办事，一心为人民，一切靠人民。这就是余江县委同志们的答案。
  忧人民之所忧，
    办人民所要办的事
    要改变一个县的生产面貌，作为战斗司令部的县委，必须具有完全、彻底为人民的思想。余江县委的同志，在这种思想的指导下，多年来坚持深入农村，和人民群众同呼吸，共命运，了解群众的愿望和要求，急他们之所急，忧他们之所忧，千方百计办他们所要求办的事。
    余江人民迫切要求办的事是什么呢？解放初期，威胁着余江人民生存的，除了残酷的封建剥削外，干旱和血吸虫病，就象两把利剑，高悬在余江人民头上。余江县虽然在长江以南，因为干旱，粮食产量很低，老百姓吃的是杂粮、红薯。余江中部地区又流行着毁灭性的血吸虫病，几千人被夺去了生命，几十个村庄灭绝人烟，上万亩田地荒芜了。
    因此，余江人民迫切要求进行社会改革，迫切要求驱除旱魔和病魔。
    余江县委的同志怀着深厚的阶级感情，紧紧抓住余江人民的迫切要求，一手抓阶级斗争，一手抓生产斗争。他们坚定地领导余江农民消灭封建剥削，走社会主义道路，也坚定地领导余江农民进行驱除旱魔和病魔的斗争。
    一九五○年冬天，在进行反霸斗争的同时，余江县委就动员了全县几千农民来到白塔河边，兴修解放坝和白塔渠。他们一连干了五个冬春，建起两座坝首，修了三百多里的干渠和支渠，引白塔河水灌溉了东西两岸八九万亩干涸的土地。
    为了消灭威胁着余江一部分地区三万多群众生命的血吸虫病，尽管世界医学史上还没有彻底消灭这种病的先例，余江县委的同志们抱定“我们共产党人就是要解除人民痛苦”的信念，和医务人员一起，深入疫区，调查研究，苦心钻研，反复试验，找到了中西医结合、治疗血吸虫病的有效办法，到一九五八年，终于送走了血吸虫病这个瘟神。
    修白塔渠、送瘟神这两件事，极大地增强了余江人民对党的感情，增强了余江人民敢于斗争、敢于动手改变自己命运的信念。
    “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”毛主席在《送瘟神》中歌颂人民的诗句，进一步启发了余江县委和余江人民。余江县委为人民、靠人民的思想更加自觉了，改变余江面貌的信心更加坚定了。县委制订了改造余江低产面貌的战略计划——突出解决干旱的问题，年年兴修水利，年年办一两件改变生产条件的大事。他们坚持长远利益和当前利益相结合的原则，讲究经济效果，务必搞一件，成一件，力争绝大部分工程当年开工，当年受益，一步一个脚印，永远保持旺盛的士气。
    从一九五一年年初开始，十五年来，余江县委依靠群众，修了大小水利工程一千一百多项，在几乎没有水利设施的基础上（解放前只有一万多亩灌溉面积），建成了灌溉全县农田百分之九十五的水利网（灌溉面积三十多万亩），其中能抗旱七十天以上的占全部水田百分之七十；把贫瘠的红壤土全部种上绿肥红花草；把双季稻由解放初期的六百亩发展到二十二万亩。
    为人民、靠人民坚持苦干十五年，余江面貌大变了。过去的疫区，今天是亩产千斤以上的稳产高产中心。过去的血吸虫病人，今天是劳动能手，是拖拉机手。过去的“棺材田”，今天是国营农场的良种试验田。过去吃糠咽菜的低产县，今天是大寨式的先进县。
    依靠人民为自己的利益而奋斗
    为人民，必须靠人民，依靠人民为自己的利益而奋斗。余江县委始终按照毛主席的教导办事。
    前几年，余江遭到了连续三年的自然灾害。在这种情况下，要不要、能不能坚持适当地进行农田基本建设？当时，畏难而退的论调是不少的，但是究竟广大群众是怎样想的呢？余江县委的同志深入群众，调查研究。他们发现：一部分生活富裕的中农主张水利都停下来，多搞些副业，多分些现金；广大贫农下中农则坚决表示，只有吃得眼前苦，才能换来子孙万代的幸福，余江要翻身，一定要修水利。余江县委用阶级分析的观点，分析了不同群众的不同意见。很明显，广大贫下中农的声音，反映了余江人民的根本利益。县委认为，必须坚定地相信群众的大多数，坚决领导群众坚持改造大自然的斗争，尽力争取时间，早为余江人民造福，早给国家、给世界人民多一点贡献。在最困难的年月里，余江县委领导群众，从实际出发，积极地有步骤地把一九五八年全面铺开的水利工程陆续配套，逐年受益，每年还完成一两个中型水利工程。他们还依靠群众自力更生，推广了绿肥，建立了繁殖良种的制度。
    一九六三年，余江在大旱之年，夺得了超过过去最好年景的收成，这证明余江人民在党的领导下，经过坚持不懈的努力，生产条件已基本改变，抗灾能力大大增强。这时候，余江县委的同志考虑：一九六四年能不能继续跃进到一个新的高度呢？群众的积极性如何呢？必须到群众中去、到实际中去了解。许多同志在蹲点中发现：有的地方，过去水利没过关，群众投肥、投工总不那么大胆，生怕一场旱灾，事倍功半；现在水利解决了，群众想方设法，多搞肥料，多投工，生产大幅度上升。有的地方，把过去失败过的“晚改早、扩大双季稻”的办法，重新拾起来，一亩田一年增产二三百斤。有的地方，晚稻仅换了一个“浙场九号”品种，一亩田也增产五十斤到一百斤。这些情况说明什么呢？说明群众中蕴藏着极大的社会主义积极性，应该及时把这种积极性组织到新的斗争中去。
    余江县委的同志懂得，要把生产推进到新的高度，不仅仅要有水、肥、土等物质条件，最最基本的一条还是依靠群众，依靠群众为自己利益而奋斗，依靠群众在实践中取得的经验。县委带领大批干部，深入生产队，展开了声势浩大的宣传运动。毛主席为余江人民写的光辉诗篇，成为余江县委向人民群众进行阶级教育的最好教材。余江人民回顾悲惨的过去，瞻望美好的未来，决心赶快摘掉低产帽子，来回答毛主席的关怀和期望。县委帮助群众逐社、逐队、逐坡、逐丘地进行分类排队，找差距，挖潜力，进一步把全县人民的革命积极性，落实到增产的措施上。
    这一年，县委工作十分紧张，政治思想工作、增产措施、经营管理，一环扣一环地全面抓。上半年气候还不错，谁知七月份一场大水，眼看快到手的粮食被淹了不少。当时县委的同志相当紧张；但是他们很快冷静下来。他们想，发大水是坏事，能不能转化为好事？仔细一分析：水大，水库蓄水多了，可以多种二季晚稻。县委马上对群众指出这种有利条件，把大家的劲头又调动起来。原来计划种十五万亩二季晚稻，结果种到十八万亩，并且加强了管理，二季晚稻比上年增产百分之八十。一九六四年粮食亩产达到六百一十七斤，比一九六三年增产百分之四十。
    在这样大的胜利面前，一部分干部有歇一口气的想法，认为一九六五年能维持现状就差不多了。余江县委及时组织大家学习《将革命进行到底》这篇文章，引导大家用一分为二的方法看本县的情况：尽管全县已有百分之九十的人民吃上香喷喷的大米；但是，还有一部分水利死角的丘陵和山区（正是当年老苏区所在地），那里的群众还在吃着红薯和杂粮，……余江的生产斗争还很艰巨，县委的领导责任还很艰巨。学习，激起了大家的斗志，增强了大家的革命责任感。大家下定决心：一定要解决老苏区的水利问题，一定要让老苏区人民吃上自己种的大米，一定要拿下余江最大的一个水利工程——白塔新渠，在全县粮食亩产六百斤的基础上，乘胜“跨过长江”。
    困难当然很多。困难集中在抢收抢种之前的四十天。这时，是六、七月的酷暑季节，天热，蚊子多，全县一万三千民工正在抢修调节水库、填方工程和总渠道，劳动量很大。万一这一万多壮劳力累病了，水利工程拿不下来，更要影响抢收抢种。县委书记、县长等都亲临前线。他们首先抓毛主席著作的学习，组织民工学习《愚公移山》，开展了“种田为革命、修水利也是为革命”的讨论。他们十分关心民工生活，从县里调来大批医务人员，大搞环境卫生；调来大批新鲜蔬菜和猪肉，保证民工吃得好，睡得香。县委书记白天和民工一起挑土，晚上到工棚查铺。这样一来，工地上出现大批铁肩膀，民工们喊着“不怕苦，不怕累，个个当新愚公”的口号，挑起土筐，向前飞奔。工程质量好，进度快，按时拿下了主要工程，而且没有病号。
    余江县委就是这样为了人民群众的利益，启发和依靠人民群众为自己的利益而奋斗，拿下了可以扩灌五万亩田的白塔新渠工程，并在当年就灌溉了三万亩，使老苏区人民群众终于吃上自己种的大米，使余江县在一九六五年成为江西第一批亩产跨长江的先进县。
    为人民利益坚持好的改正错的
    十多年的战斗，余江县委在改造客观世界的同时，不断改造自己的主观世界。他们工作一贯繁忙紧张，但是在县委指导思想中压倒一切的是不断用毛泽东思想武装自己，用毛泽东思想武装全县干部和余江人民。县委学习毛主席著作十分认真，常委有一个中心学习小组，县委书记当组长，做什么，学什么，带着问题学。常委之间能经常开展批评和自我批评，坚持过组织生活。在布置一项中心任务时，从县委到基层，常常用毛主席思想来对照检查。正因为他们处处听毛主席的话，时时按毛主席的指示办事，他们为谁服务的观点十分明确，知道自己的义务和责任。因此，他们千方百计办群众所要求办的事，并且能够做到为人民利益坚持好的，为人民利益改正错的。
    余江县委在为人民的前进道路上也经历过挫折和失败的考验。那是一九五八年，余江县委由于急于改变低产面貌，在全县一下铺开三十多项水利工程。劳力不够，不少工程修了个半拉子。全县在水、肥、土等条件没有过关的情况下，又普遍扩种双季稻。结果，相当一部分两季产量不如一季产量高。群众很有意见。当时，有的干部灰心泄气了，工作起来小手小脚，甚至产生“一朝被蛇咬，三年怕草绳”的精神状态。余江县委认真学习了毛主席著作，头脑清醒了，信心百倍地告诉大家：“我们没有掌握事物的客观规律，工作遇到了挫折。但这是暂时的，重要的是思想不能失败。”县委组织全体干部，重新学习毛主席的《为人民服务》等文章，正确总结工作中的经验教训，不盲目否定一切，不和个人的成败得失联系在一起，坚决要做到毛主席所教导的，为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。县委联系余江的情况，使大家认识到：历年来兴修水利是对的，错的是一年之中工程面铺得太大，今后还要坚持兴修水利，只是一定要干一桩，成一桩。晚田改早田，旱田改水田，单季改双季，这些在方向上也没有错，错在水、肥条件还没有具备时就大改。因此，重要的是创造水、肥条件。余江县委就是这样把失败和挫折变成争取成功的有益经验，继续领导全县人民按照“干劲要大、步子要稳”的精神，扎扎实实地进行改造自然的斗争，终于取得了很大的成功。
    余江县委的同志没有满足于已得的成就。他们决心在今后工作中要努力做到：有成绩夸不倒，任务重压不倒，困难多难不倒，工作出了错误批评不倒。有了这样的决心和勇气，可以相信余江县今后的工作一定会如旭日东升，为人民，为社会主义放出更多的光和热！
