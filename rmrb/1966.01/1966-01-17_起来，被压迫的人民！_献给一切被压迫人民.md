    Arise, Ye Oppressed People!
    ——Dedicated to all Oppressed People
    [Malagasy] Reina Why weep over vanished past? Why bother with memories that add to the pain?
    Only cowards shed tears! Why beg in vain for items that are rightfully yours? Why ask foreigners for heirlooms left by your ancestors?
    Only slaves beg! Why suffer and ultimately starve to death? Why let your loved ones wither and die?
    Know that happiness belongs only to those who are good at fighting! Arise! Arise and look around: from Tirana to Beijing, people of all countries have risen up and swept away the exploitative system of imperialist murderers. Arise! Draw lessons from the history of the nation, enrich your experience, and create your own science! Do not wait for cunning gods to return wealth and freedom to you; stand up for yourselves! Arise, raise the torch of freedom, wield it freely, pass it on to your brothers, sisters, and descendants, and let it last forever. But be careful! Hold high the true torch left by Lenin, enriched by Stalin, and developed by Mao Zedong. Discard the torch that you find easy to lift, because it is merely pieced together with clay. Otherwise, your foolishness will return you to the clutches of your former masters. One is Marxism, the other is revisionism. Arise, look around, but especially be full of confidence!
                  [Translated by Wang Linjin]

### 起来，被压迫的人民！——献给一切被压迫人民

    起来，被压迫的人民！
    ——献给一切被压迫人民
    〔马尔加什〕　雷纳为什么要对消逝的往事涰泣？为什么要为增添苦痛的追忆烦恼？
    只有懦夫才流泪！为什么徒然乞求原属自己的物品？为什么向洋人索求祖先留给自己的遗物？
    只有奴才才乞怜！为什么受尽苦难却终于饿死？为什么听任你的亲人憔悴和死亡？
    须知幸福只属善于斗争的人！起来吧！起来观看四方：从地拉那到北京，各国人民都已奋起，扫除了帝国主义杀人犯的剥削制度。起来！从民族的历史，吸取教训，丰富经验，创建自己的科学！不要等待狡猾的神灵，归还给你财富和自由，自己站起来吧！起来，举起自由的火炬，把它运用自如，传给你的兄弟姐妹和子孙，让它万古长存。可是要小心啊！要高举列宁遗留下的、斯大林所丰富的、又由毛泽东发展的真正的火炬。丢开那支你觉得容易举起的火炬，因为它不过是用陶土拼凑起来的。否则，你的愚蠢将使你重新回到你从前主人的魔爪中。一个是马克思主义，一个是修正主义。起来吧，观看四方，但特别要满怀信心！
