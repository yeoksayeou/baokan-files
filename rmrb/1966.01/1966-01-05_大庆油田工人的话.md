    To maintain "good" as the guiding principle in all circumstances and ensure that the quality of the project is top-notch, one must have a red heart dedicated to the country for a lifetime, always thinking of the interests of the country and the people, consciously be strict, and not forget one's position as master. Only in this way can we be strict on every millimeter and meticulous on every thread in construction.
        Third Construction Team of the Refining and Construction Company

    When we work, we cannot be satisfied with no problems at the time; we must consider whether it can be guaranteed for decades or hundreds of years.
          Crane Operator Cao Shengfu

    Our working class is the master of the country. Every job we do must be something we dare to vouch for and guarantee. Having "good" as the guiding principle relies on our red heart as masters to guarantee it.
          Riveter Xia Huarong

    Being responsible for quality is being responsible to the Party and the people. No matter what we do, we cannot lose our sense of responsibility as masters. If we have the slightest uncertainty about any job we handle, we must never hand it over.
            Pipe Fitter Li Youqing

    大庆油田工人的话
    要想在任何情况下都能坚持好字当头，保证工程质量过得硬，必须有一颗为国家负责一辈子的红心，时刻想到国家和人民的利益，自觉从严，不忘记自己的主人翁身分。只有这样，施工中才能严在每个毫米上，细在每道丝扣上。
        炼建第三施工队
    咱们干活不能满足于当时不出问题，要想到它几十年、几百年能不能保险。
          起重工　曹生富
    咱们工人阶级是国家的主人。经咱们的手干的每件活，都要敢拍胸脯，敢打“保票”。好字当头，要靠咱们一颗主人翁的红心作保证。
          铆工　夏华荣
    对质量负责，就是对党、对人民负责。我们不管干什么活，都不能丢掉主人翁的责任心。我们经手的每件活，如果自己有半点不放心，就绝不能交出去。
            管工　李有庆
