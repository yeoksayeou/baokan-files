    "Free Khmer" is a rebel organization pieced together by a small group of Cambodian national scum, supported and fostered by U.S. imperialism. It is a tool for the United States to carry out aggression and subversion against Cambodia. The ringleaders of this rebel organization are Sơn Ngọc Thành and Sim Var.
    Sơn Ngọc Thành was the former leader of the Cambodian Democratic Party and once served as the "Prime Minister" of the puppet regime during the Japanese occupation of Cambodia. In 1952, after his activities against Prince Sihanouk in Cambodia failed, he fled to Thailand and became a running dog of U.S. imperialism. His troops were equipped with American weapons and frequently harassed the Cambodian border from bases in Thailand.
    Sim Var served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia in 1955. In early 1959, under the planning of the United States, he secretly plotted to overthrow Prince Sihanouk. When this conspiracy was exposed, he secretly fled to South Vietnam with the assistance of the American embassy. Later, under the instigation of the United States and its Thai and South Vietnamese puppet regimes, he colluded with Sơn Ngọc Thành to organize the so-called "Free Khmer" in South Vietnam and Thailand.
    The "Free Khmer" has county and provincial committees in South Vietnam, with its central organization located in Saigon. It is supplied with money, weapons, and radio stations by the United States and its lackeys, Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppet regime. The South Vietnamese puppet regime trains armed bandits on its behalf, with American instructors in the training camps. "Free Khmer" troops are formed in Thailand and South Vietnam. The strength of the "Free Khmer" troops in South Vietnam is estimated at three thousand, and the Saigon puppet regime has recently added two thousand more. This armed bandit force frequently appears in the border areas of Cambodia bordering Thailand, South Vietnam, and Laos, robbing and destroying peaceful Cambodian villages, and engaging in subversive and destructive activities. Recently, while plotting to expand the war of aggression in Indochina, U.S. imperialism has instructed "Free Khmer" bandits to step up their invasion of Cambodian territory. The intrusion of this gang has been severely打击 by the Cambodian army and people. (Zhou)

    “自由高棉”是叛乱组织
    所谓“自由高棉”，是由美帝支持和豢养的一小撮柬埔寨民族败类拼凑的一个叛乱组织，它是美国对柬埔寨进行侵略和颠覆活动的工具。这个叛乱组织头子是山玉成和桑·萨里。
    山玉成是前柬埔寨民主党头子，曾经当过日本占领柬埔寨时期傀儡政权的“首相”。一九五二年在柬埔寨进行反西哈努克亲王的活动失败后逃亡泰国，充当美国帝国主义走狗，他的部队装备了美国武器，从泰国基地出发，时常侵扰柬埔寨边境。
    桑·萨里于一九五五年曾任柬埔寨副首相。一九五九年初，他在美国策划下，密谋推翻西哈努克亲王。当这个阴谋败露以后，他就在美国大使馆的协助下秘密逃往南越。以后，在美国及其泰国和南越傀儡指使下，又和山玉成纠集在一起，在南越和泰国组织了所谓“自由高棉”。
    “自由高棉”在南越设有县委员会和省委员会，中央机构设在西贡。它由美国及其仆从泰国和南越傀儡政权供给金钱、武器和电台等等；由南越傀儡政权代为训练武装匪徒，训练营中并有美国教官；在泰国和南越组成“自由高棉”部队。在南越的“自由高棉”部队的兵力估计有三千人，西贡傀儡政权新近又补充了两千人。这支武装匪徒经常出没在柬埔寨同泰国、南越和老挝接壤的边境，抢劫和破坏柬埔寨的和平村庄，进行颠覆和破坏活动。最近，美帝国主义在策划扩大侵略印度支那战争的同时，指使“自由高棉”匪徒加紧侵犯柬埔寨领土。这股匪帮的入侵受到了柬埔寨军民的沉重打击。　（周）
