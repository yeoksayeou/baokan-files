    Hanoi, January 16 (Xinhua) -- According to Vietnam News Agency, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on the 15th, saying that the U.S. "peace seeking" campaign is in essence a conspiracy to conceal its plan to intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The statement said: "For more than twenty days, the U.S. authorities have been trumpeting their so-called 'peace seeking campaign' incessantly. But in reality, during this period, they are frantically intensifying the war of aggression against South Vietnam with unprecedentedly barbaric policies and conspiracies."

    The statement listed the crimes of the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam, including the use of poison gas and chemical toxins, launching large-scale "mopping-up" operations, implementing "scorched earth" policies, massacring the people of South Vietnam, and continuing to transport large numbers of troops and weapons into South Vietnam, preparing to expand the war of aggression. It said, "Obviously, U.S. imperialism is recklessly carrying out new and extremely dangerous military adventures in Indochina, trampling on the sacred national rights of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Laos and Cambodia, flagrantly violating the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Indochina question and the 1962 Geneva Agreements on the Laos question, seriously violating the most basic principles of international law, and losing all conscience. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front strongly condemns these monstrous crimes of the U.S. aggressors to world public opinion."

    The statement emphasized that the U.S. imperialists' brutal actions themselves expose the fraud of their "peace" actions. The White House's so-called "Fourteen Points" plan, despite being disguised with a layer of ambiguous and cunning rhetoric, is full of contradictions, and its aggressive and bellicose nature cannot be concealed. In fact, this plan only repeats stale arguments, shamelessly distorting the patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people, falsely accusing North Vietnam of aggression against the South, using the obligations assumed by the United States to its Saigon lackeys as an excuse, evading the withdrawal of U.S. invading forces from South Vietnam, refusing to leave South Vietnam, prolonging the division of Vietnam, refusing to recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people, and arrogantly forcing the South Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and allow the United States to enslave them. The so-called "peace seeking" campaign of the U.S. ruling clique is in essence entirely a trick to conceal their conspiracy to intensify and expand the war of aggression, and to pacify world and American public opinion that strongly condemns them. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front resolutely refutes this arrogant and deceptive claim by the U.S. ruling clique.

    The statement expressed "full agreement with the statement of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on January 5, 1966, and the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 4, 9, and 11, 1966, demanding that U.S. imperialism respect the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue, cease all military actions, stop the use of chemical toxins and poison gas, immediately abandon their barbaric 'burn all, destroy all, and kill all' policy in South Vietnam, and permanently and unconditionally cease all actions infringing on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They must abandon their policy of aggression against South Vietnam, immediately withdraw the troops of the United States and its vassal states from South Vietnam, allow the South Vietnamese people to resolve the affairs of South Vietnam themselves in accordance with the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, and allow the people of the two regions of Vietnam to peacefully reunify Vietnam without foreign interference."

    The statement called on "all freedom- and justice-loving people in the world and the American people to take active actions to stop the actions of U.S. war criminals in Vietnam, to be vigilant, expose, and smash their deceptive 'peace' rhetoric, and to more resolutely and forcefully support the just patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people."

    The statement called on "the fraternal peoples of Laos and Cambodia to further strengthen their solidarity with the Vietnamese people and resolutely defeat all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to intensify and expand the war in Indochina."

    The statement said, "U.S. imperialism should not expect to use violence to make the heroic Vietnamese people submit. The more savagely and stubbornly they intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the deeper the hatred of the thirty-one million Vietnamese people will be, the more closely they will unite to eliminate the aggressors and the traitors who act as their pawns, liberate the South, defend the North, and realize the peaceful reunification of the country, thereby contributing to the defense of peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world."

      "The seventeen million people of North Vietnam, taking the indomitable struggle of the fourteen million people of South Vietnam as an example, will make greater efforts to increase production, heighten vigilance, be ready at any time to crush every new conspiracy and adventurous action of U.S. imperialism, and at the same time will do their utmost to support the liberation revolution in South Vietnam."

    Hanoi, January 15 (Xinhua) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, a spokesperson for the External Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on January 9, strongly condemning the United States for using poison gas to intensify the massacre of the people of South Vietnam.

    The statement condemned the United States for releasing poison gas and chemical poisons in Vinh Quang village in Binh Dinh province and in many places in Quang Tri, Tan An-Cholon, Can Tho, Ben Tre provinces.

    The statement pointed out: "The U.S. imperialists are using means of warfare that have been prohibited by the Geneva Treaties of 1922 and 1925. Obviously, its brutality has surpassed that of the Hitler fascists and has trampled on the most basic laws of humanity. The increasing use of poison gas, chemical poisons, and other means of mass murder by the United States, while rapidly increasing its troop strength and implementing the barbaric 'kill all, burn all, destroy all' policy, powerfully proves that the Johnson clique's so-called 'peace sincerity' is hypocritical. This is a big fraud, attempting to deceive American and world public opinion, and to escape their isolated position in the war of aggression against South Vietnam and the destructive war against North Vietnam."

    The statement emphasized that "no weapons of U.S. imperialism can shake the determination of the South Vietnamese people to defeat the U.S. aggressors."

    The statement resolutely demanded that the U.S. government immediately stop using poison gas and other chemical weapons. The U.S. imperialists must bear full responsibility for their extremely barbaric crimes.

    The statement called on all people in the world who cherish peace, humanity, and justice, governments of all countries, organizations of all countries, and international organizations, scientists and prominent figures all over the world, especially scientists and prominent figures in the United States, to severely condemn and take timely measures to stop these crimes of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and force them to immediately stop these barbaric and inhumane actions.

    The statement pointed out, "The U.S. imperialists should remember that just as germ warfare could not save them in the war of aggression against Korea, they should not expect poison gas and other weapons to enable them and their lackeys to avoid complete defeat in South Vietnam."

    The statement said, "If the U.S. imperialists truly desire genuine peace in Vietnam, they must implement the five-point statement put forward by the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on March 22, 1965."

    The statement concluded by saying that the South Vietnamese people will be of one heart and mind, determined to fight until there is not a single U.S. aggressor left in South Vietnam, in order to liberate the South, defend the North, and realize an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral South Vietnam, and then reunify the country.

    越南祖国战线揭露美国玩弄“和谈”骗局掩盖扩大战争阴谋
    越南北方人民坚决支援南方争取解放统一祖国
    南越民族解放阵线对外联络委员会重申打败美帝决心不会动摇
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团十五日发表声明说，美国“谋求和平”的运动实质上是一个掩饰它加剧和扩大侵越战争的计划的阴谋。
    声明说：“二十多天来，美国当局不停地为它的所谓‘谋求和平的运动’大吹大擂。但是实际上它这一时期正在以空前野蛮的政策和阴谋狂热地加剧侵略越南南方的战争。”
    声明列举美国侵略者在越南南方使用毒气和化学毒物，发动大规模“扫荡”，实行“焦土”政策，屠杀南方人民，并且继续把大量军队和武器运进南方，准备扩大侵略战争的各种罪恶事实后说，“显然，美帝国主义正在肆无忌惮地在印度支那进行新的极端危险的军事冒险，践踏越南人民以及老挝和柬埔寨人民的神圣的民族权利，悍然破坏一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议和一九六二年关于老挝问题的协议，严重违反国际法最起码的原则，丧尽天良。越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团向全世界舆论强烈谴责美国侵略者这些滔天罪行。”
    声明强调说，美帝国主义的残暴行动本身揭穿了它们的“和平”行动的骗局。白宫的所谓“十四点方案”尽管盖上了一层暧昧的狡诈的词句作为伪装，但是里面充满了矛盾，它的侵略和好战性质是掩盖不住的。其实，这个方案只是重复了陈腐的说法，无耻地歪曲越南南方人民的爱国斗争，诬蔑越南北方对南方进行了侵略，以美国对它的西贡走狗承担的义务为借口，规避把美国侵略军撤出越南南方，赖在越南南方不走，长期分裂越南，拒不承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正代表，横暴地强迫越南南方人民放下他们的武器而听任美国奴役。美国统治集团的所谓“谋求和平”运动实质上完全是一个诡计，用来掩饰他们加剧和扩大侵略战争的阴谋，平息强烈谴责他们的世界和美国舆论。越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团坚决驳斥美国统治集团的这种横蛮骗人的说法。
    声明表示“完全赞同越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团一九六六年一月五日的声明和越南民主共和国外交部一九六六年一月四日、九日和十一日的声明，要求美帝国主义尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，停止一切军事行动，停止使用化学毒物和毒气，立即放弃他们在越南南方实行的‘烧光、毁光和杀光’的野蛮政策，永远、无条件地停止一切侵犯越南民主共和国领土的行动。他们必须放弃他们对越南南方的侵略政策，立即把美国和附庸国的军队从越南南方撤走，让越南南方人民自己按照越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领来解决越南南方的事务，让两个地区的越南人民和平统一越南，外国不得干涉。”
    声明呼吁“全世界一切爱自由和正义的人民和美国人民采取积极的行动来制止美国战争罪犯在越南的行动，警惕、揭露和粉碎他们骗人的‘和平’谰言，更加坚决有力地支持越南人民正义的爱国斗争。”
    声明呼吁“老挝和柬埔寨兄弟人民进一步加强他们同越南人民的团结，坚决打败美帝国主义在印度支那加剧和扩大战争的一切阴谋。”
    声明说，“美帝国主义不要指望用暴力来使英雄的越南人民屈膝。他们越是野蛮和顽固地加剧和扩大侵越战争，三千一百万越南人民对它们的仇恨就越深，他们就越加紧密团结起来消灭侵略者和充当他们走狗的卖国贼，解放南方，保卫北方，以实现国家的和平统一，从而对保卫印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平作出贡献。
      “越南北方一千七百万人民以一千四百万越南南方人民不屈的斗争为榜样，将作出更大的努力来增加生产，提高警惕，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的每一个新阴谋和冒险行动，同时将竭尽最大的力量支持越南南方的解放革命。”
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人一月九日发表声明，强烈谴责美国使用毒气加紧屠杀越南南方人民。
    声明谴责美国在平定省荣光村和广治、新安—堤岸、芹苴、槟椥等省的许多地方施放毒气和化学毒药。
    声明指出：“美帝国主义者使用已被一九二二年和一九二五年日内瓦条约所禁止的战争手段，显然，它的暴行已经超过希特勒法西斯分子，并且践踏了人类最起码的法律。美国越来越多地使用毒气、化学毒药和其他大规模杀人手段，同时正在迅速地增加兵力和实行野蛮的‘杀光、烧光、毁光’政策，这有力地证明了约翰逊集团的所谓‘和平诚意’是伪善的。这是一个大骗局，企图欺骗美国和世界的舆论，摆脱他们在侵略越南南方的战争和对越南北方的毁灭性战争中的孤立处境。”
    声明强调说，“美帝国主义的任何武器也不能动摇越南南方人民要打败美国侵略者的决心。”
    声明坚决要求美国政府立即停止使用毒气和其他化学武器。美帝国主义者必须为他们野蛮透顶的罪行负全部责任。
    声明呼吁世界上所有珍视和平、人道和正义的人，各国政府、各国组织和国际组织，全世界的科学家和知名人士，特别是美国的科学家和知名人士，严厉谴责和采取及时的措施来制止美帝国主义侵略者这些罪行，并迫使他们立即停止这些野蛮的灭绝人性的行动。
    声明指出，“美帝国主义者应当记住，正象细菌战不能在侵朝战争中挽救他们一样，他们也不要指望毒气和其他武器能够使他们和他们的走狗避免在越南南方遭到彻底失败。”
    声明说，“如果美帝国主义者真是希望越南的真正和平，他们必须执行越南南方民族解放阵线在一九六五年三月二十二日提出的五点声明。”
    声明最后说，越南南方人民，将万众一心，决心战斗到越南南方没有一个美国侵略者为止，以便解放南方，保卫北方，实现一个独立、民主、和平和中立的越南南方，进而重新统一国家。
