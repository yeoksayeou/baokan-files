    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 1st. The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on January 1st, calling on all countries in the world to take measures to safeguard the peace of Cambodia, which is under armed aggression by Thailand.

    Thai armed forces launched a fierce attack on the Cambodian border post at Os Smach in Oddar Meanchey province on December 30th and 31st.

    The statement said: "The invasion of Cambodian territory by Thai armed forces shows that the Bangkok government, supported by the United States, wants to repeat the aggression against Cambodia in 1940 and 1941 by the same means, when this aggression was carried out in collusion with Japan."

    The statement said: "The Royal Government draws the attention of all justice-upholding and peace-loving countries to Thailand's criminal aggression against Cambodia. This is an unprovoked attack by a member state of the United Nations against a peaceful country, a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international law."

    The statement said that Cambodia will take all measures to ensure that its territorial integrity is respected.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 1st. Cambodian Secretary of State for Information, Chau Sau, said on the afternoon of January 1st that the Thai armed forces' attack on the Os Smach post in Oddar Meanchey province on December 30th, using helicopters and mortars, was carried out under the instigation of the United States and with the support of "Free Khmer" elements.

    Chau Sau made these remarks at a press conference while reading a statement issued today by the Royal Government of Cambodia. He refuted the propaganda in the *Bangkok Post* news report that the attack was launched by "Free Khmer" elements. Chau Sau pointed out that this attack was not a simple attack, but a continuation of the Thai forces' multiple attacks on Cambodia in 1965.

    Chau Sau said: As stated in the resolution of the 20th National Congress of the Cambodian People's Socialist Community, Cambodia will, at all costs, use all means at its disposal to resist all attacks to defend Cambodia's independence, neutrality, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

    Chau Sau also said: If Thailand recognizes the "Free Khmer" movement, Cambodia will recognize the Patriotic Front of Thailand.

    Chau Sau also said that in this attack incident, eight Cambodians were killed and another eight were injured, including the governor and military district commander of Oddar Meanchey province.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 1st. According to a supplementary report published by the Cambodian News Agency on January 1st, Thai armed forces brazenly launched a fierce attack on the provincial defense army post in the Os Smach area of Cambodia on December 30th, killing eight Cambodians.

    The report said that on December 30, 1965, approximately 200 Thai armed forces began to fiercely bombard and surround the Cambodian post in the Os Smach area of Oddar Meanchey province, starting at 5:00 AM, using mortars. Among those killed were a provincial defense soldier and a girl, and among those injured were three provincial defense soldiers and three women. Part of the post was burned down. However, the enemy was unable to enter the post.

    At approximately 2:30 PM, two Thai aircraft strafed the post and its vicinity. On the same day, Cambodian reinforcements arrived in the Os Smach area and engaged in fierce fighting with Thai troops on Cambodian territory, approximately three kilometers from the post.

    The Cambodian News Agency said that Cambodian military authorities have taken full measures to deal with the situation.

    柬政府发表声明谴责美国指使泰国侵柬
    柬埔寨将采取一切措施保卫领土主权
    柬埔寨部队英勇反击，同泰国侵略军进行激战
    新华社金边一日电　柬埔寨王国政府一日发表声明，呼吁全世界各国采取措施，来维护受到泰国武装侵略的柬埔寨的和平。
    泰国武装部队在十二月三十日和三十一日对柬埔寨奥多棉藏省奥斯马的边防哨所，发动了猛烈进攻。
    声明说：“泰国武装部队侵入柬埔寨领土一事表明，得到美国支持的曼谷政府想用同样的手段重演一九四○年和一九四一年对柬埔寨的侵略，当时这种侵略是同日本共谋进行的”。
    声明说：“王国政府提请伸张正义和爱好和平的一切国家注意泰国对柬埔寨的罪恶侵略。这是联合国的一个会员国对一个和平国家的无端的进攻，是对联合国宪章和国际法的明目张胆的破坏”。
    声明说，柬埔寨方面将采取一切措施使自己的领土完整得到尊重。
    新华社金边一日电　柬埔寨新闻国务秘书谢桑一日下午说，泰国武装部队十二月三十日使用直升飞机和迫击炮对奥多棉藏省奥斯马哨所的进攻是在美国指使下和“自由高棉”分子的支持下进行的。
    谢桑是在记者招待会上宣读了柬埔寨王国政府今天发表的一项声明时发表了这番谈话。他驳斥了《曼谷邮报》消息中关于这次进攻是由“自由高棉”分子发动的宣传。谢桑指出，这次进攻不是一次单纯的进攻，而是在一九六五年中泰国部队多次进攻柬埔寨的继续。
    谢桑说：正如柬埔寨人民社会同盟第二十次全国代表大会的决议所说的那样，柬埔寨将以自己所拥有的手段不惜代价抗击一切进攻，以保卫柬埔寨的独立、中立、主权和领土完整。
    谢桑又说：如果泰国承认“自由高棉”运动，柬埔寨就承认泰国爱国阵线。
    谢桑还说，在这一进攻事件中，八个柬埔寨人被杀死，另有八人受伤，其中包括奥多棉藏省的省长兼军分区司令。
    新华社金边一日电　据柬埔寨新闻社一日发表的补充报道，泰国武装部队在十二月三十日对柬埔寨奥斯马地方的省防军哨所悍然发动猛烈进攻，打死八名柬埔寨人。
    消息说，一九六五年十二月三十日，泰国武装部队约二百人，从上午五时开始，用迫击炮猛烈轰击并且包围柬埔寨奥多棉藏省奥斯马地方的哨所。被打死的有一名省防军和一个女孩，受伤的有三名省防军和三个妇女。一部分哨所被烧毁。但是敌人没有能够进入哨所。
    在将近十四点三十分时，两架泰国飞机对哨所及其附近地区进行了扫射。当天，柬埔寨增援部队到达奥斯马地方，并且在距哨所约三公里的柬埔寨领土上同泰国部队进行了激战。
    柬埔寨新闻社说，柬埔寨军事当局已采取充分的措施来对付这种局面。
