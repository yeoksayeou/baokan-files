    Studying Chairman Mao's Writings, Conducting Scientific and Cultural Activities
    Cultural Centers in Xinjiang's Agricultural and Pastoral Areas are Well-Run
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi) The broad rural and pastoral areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have established more than 8,800 cultural centers. In the communes and production teams that have established cultural centers, after a day of hard work, members come to the cultural centers one after another to read Chairman Mao's writings, rehearse cultural programs, and listen to Akens (Kazakh folk artists) sing and play. Some young people are also concentrating on scientific research work here.
    All cultural centers regard organizing members to study Chairman Mao's writings as their main activity. This study has played a significant role in raising the awareness of members and promoting agricultural and pastoral production. After the Touxue Brigade Cultural Center of the Wulawusu Commune in Shawan County organized members to study articles such as "Get Rid of the Burden and Start the Machine," all members of the brigade took the initiative to find gaps and tap potential with advanced teams, greatly stimulating the labor enthusiasm and production initiative of the members.
    In carrying out various cultural activities, cultural centers in various places adhere to the principles of amateurism, voluntarism, small size, and variety, and pay close attention to ensuring that cultural activities serve class struggle and production struggle. Many cultural centers have compiled the bloody and tearful family histories of poor and lower-middle peasants and working herdsmen, or exhibited their family histories in the form of comic strips. Some cultural centers have cut out and pasted news reports and photos of Wang Jie's deeds published in newspapers to carry out publicity and education among the masses, deeply educating the broad masses of members, especially young members. Cultural centers in Shache, Mulei, and Barkol counties often organize members to study the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese people in fighting against the aggression of US imperialism. Many members said: The cultural center has broadened our horizons, allowing us to see not only all of China, but also the whole world.
    Under the organization and promotion of cultural centers in various places, many folk art forms loved by the Uygur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups are serving socialist revolution and socialist construction with brand-new content.

    学习毛主席著作　进行科学文化活动
    新疆农牧区文化室办得好
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区广大农村牧区已经建立了八千八百多个文化室。在已经建立文化室的社队里，社员们辛勤劳动一天之后，纷纷来到文化室读毛主席著作，排练文娱节目，听阿肯（哈萨克民间艺人）弹唱。也有一些青年在这里专心进行科学研究工作。
    各地文化室都把组织社员学习毛主席著作当做主要的活动。这一学习对提高社员觉悟、促进农牧业生产起了显著的作用。沙湾县乌拉乌苏公社头学大队文化室组织社员学习《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章后，全队社员主动与先进队找差距、挖潜力，大大激发了社员的劳动热情和生产积极性。
    各地文化室在开展各种文化活动中，坚持业余自愿和小型多样的原则，并且十分注意使文化活动为阶级斗争和生产斗争服务。有不少文化室编写了贫农下中农和劳动牧民血泪斑斑的家史，或把他们的家史画成连环画展出，有些文化室剪贴了报纸上刊登的王杰的事迹和照片，在群众中进行宣传教育，使广大社员特别是青年社员受到了深刻的教育。莎车、木垒、巴里坤等县的文化室经常组织社员学习越南人民打击美帝国主义侵略者的英雄事迹。许多社员说：文化室使我们开阔了眼界，不仅看到了全中国，而且看到了全世界。
    在各地文化室的组织推动下，维吾尔、哈萨克等民族所热爱的许多民间文艺形式，都以崭新的内容为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。
