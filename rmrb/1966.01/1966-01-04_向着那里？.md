    In a county, over ninety-five percent of the population are farmers. It is only natural that the various departments of the county should face the grassroots and the farmers. However, have they truly “faced” them? And how can they truly "face" them? These questions are well worth studying.

    How can the county's various departments and industrial, transportation, financial, and trade sectors face the countryside and achieve revolutionization? This is an important issue that each department and sector should actively resolve. However, based on the situations in Gu'an, Taicang, and Quanjiao counties, the decisive factor in achieving revolutionization in each department and sector is the revolutionization of the county party committee's leadership. The masses say: "Whether things are good or bad depends on the leadership." This is indeed the case.

    Comrades in Gu'an believe that in this matter, the county party committee leadership must first engage in conscious revolution. Leading cadres cannot forget the masses simply because their own lives are comfortable. If certain leading cadres, because they receive some kind of preferential treatment, turn a blind eye to things and allow vulgar bourgeois ideologies and work styles to remain in the revolutionary leading organs, it would be even more dangerous.

    In resolving this problem, comrades in Taicang adopted the method of mobilizing cadres from various departments to engage in large-scale exposure and discussion, repeatedly deliberating on the fundamental issue of "serving the people" and identifying the root cause of political indifference.

    Quanjiao County focused on grasping both ends: one end was mobilizing grassroots cadres and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants who had frequent contact with the work of various departments and sectors to boldly offer opinions; the other end was studying Chairman Mao's works and seeking answers. They finally clarified that facing the countryside is a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and this struggle has only just begun.

    These few counties are truly determined to make revolution. When promoting the revolution of various departments and sectors, they do not only revolutionize the cadres' lives, but first revolutionize their own; they do not only solve their general ideological and work style problems, but solve problems from the old roots of class viewpoint and worldview.

    In a county, there are many, many units, and hundreds of cadres. Where do they turn? The key lies in where the county party committee turns. And where the county party committee turns depends on where its heart turns. Where exactly does it turn? We hope everyone will discuss it themselves!

### 向着那里？

    向着那里？
    在一个县里，百分之九十五以上的人口是农民。县的各部门应该面向基层，面向农民，这是当然的事。可是，是不是真正“面向”了？怎样才能做到“面向”？这些问题大大值得研究。
    县的各部门和工交财贸各行业如何做到面向农村，实现革命化？这是各部门各行业自己应当积极解决的重要问题。但是，从固安、太仓、全椒三个县的情况看，各部门各行业实现革命化的决定因素，是县委领导的革命化。群众说：“好不好，在领导。”的确是这样。
    固安的同志认为：在这个问题上，县委领导首先要自觉革命。领导干部不能因为自己的生活没问题了，便忘了群众。如果某些领导干部因为自己得到某种照顾，便遇事睁只眼，闭只眼，让庸俗的资产阶级思想作风残留在革命领导机关之中，那就更加危险了。
    太仓的同志在解决这个问题上，采取动员各部门干部大揭、大议的办法，从“为人民服务”这个根本性问题上，反反复复进行讨论，检查出政治不挂帅的病根。
    全椒县着重抓两头，一头是动员那些对各部门各行业的工作接触多的基层干部和贫下中农代表大胆提意见；一头是学习毛主席著作，寻找答案。他们终于弄清楚：面向农村，是一场兴无灭资的斗争，这个斗争仅仅才开始。
    这几个县是真正下决心革命的。他们在促进各部门各行业革命时，不是光革干部的命，而是首先革自己的命；不是只解决自己的一般思想作风问题，而是从阶级观点和世界观这样一些老根子上来解决问题。
    在一个县里，有很多很多单位，有成百干部。他们面向那里？关键在于县委面向那里。而县委面向那里，又决定于县委的心向那里。到底是向着那里？希望大家自己议一议！
