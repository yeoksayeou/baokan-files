    Under the education of the Party and the help of comrades, in the past few years, I have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I have made some progress in ideological transformation and work. In particular, repeatedly studying articles such as "Serve the People" has gradually made me understand that a person's life should be a revolutionary life, a life of struggle, a life of learning, and a life of serving the people. Now, I will talk about a few points of my experience in studying "Serve the People." Serving the People is Determined by the Nature of the Party
    In 1958, I began to study the articles "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." At that time, I did not fully understand the importance of commercial work. I felt that as a salesperson, I dealt with scales and weighing pans every day, and the things I sold were just cabbage, radishes, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. How much does this have to do with socialist construction! It is not as meaningful as going to factories to build machines or to construction sites to build buildings. Therefore, I was somewhat depressed in my thinking. How should I understand and treat my work? I studied "Serve the People" with this question. In this article, Chairman Mao praised Comrade Zhang Side, saying that he was a good comrade in our ranks. "Comrade Zhang Side died for the interests of the people, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai." Chairman Mao also taught us not to be afraid of difficulties. "In times of difficulty, we must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." These words greatly educated me, and I began to know that there is no distinction between high and low in revolutionary work; being a salesperson is needed for socialist construction and the interests of the people. I thought: For the revolution, Comrade Zhang Side gave his life, so I should not be picky or afraid of difficulties in my work. Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people, so I should listen to the Party.
    Since then, I have repeatedly studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and other articles in the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and I have gained a further understanding of why we should serve the people wholeheartedly and how to serve the people wholeheartedly.
    Chairman Mao said: "Why should there be a revolutionary party? Because there are enemies in the world who oppress the people, and the people want to overthrow the oppression of the enemy, so there must be a revolutionary party." He also said: "Serving the people wholeheartedly, never being divorced from the masses for a moment; proceeding from the interests of the people in everything, and not from the interests of individuals or small groups; the consistency of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the leading organs of the Party; these are our starting points." This made me understand that serving the people wholeheartedly is determined by the nature and purpose of the Party. The Party is born to serve the people; it has no other purpose than to serve the people wholeheartedly. After reading Chairman Mao's book and thinking about the actual situation, I felt even more enlightened. I thought: Before liberation, the Party led the people of the whole country to carry out the struggle to overthrow the three great mountains, and now it is leading the people of the whole country to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction. These are all concentrated expressions of serving the people wholeheartedly. Precisely because the Party serves the people, thinks of the masses in everything, does things to their hearts, and benefits the people and eliminates harm, the masses support the Party from the bottom of their hearts. With the support and love of the masses, the Party can develop from small to large and achieve one victory after another in revolution and construction. I also thought: There can be many standards to distinguish what is different between the Communist Party and other parties, but the most fundamental standard is that the Communist Party is a party that serves the people wholeheartedly, "completely for the liberation of the people, and thoroughly for the interests of the people." From ancient times to the present, no other political party has been able to do this.
    When I understood these principles, I thought: The Party is composed of Party members. The Party's nature and purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly must be realized by thousands of Party members serving the people every moment. I am a Communist Party member, and my duty is to serve the people wholeheartedly; my position for serving the people is the salesperson's job. If I do the salesperson's job well, it will be conducive to realizing the Party's purpose of serving the people; I can send the warmth of the Party to the hearts of the masses through our hands, so that the masses love the Party, Chairman Mao, and the socialist system even more. In this way, I demand that I should consciously serve the people, not passively serve the people. I think: It is not enough to merely generally understand that the Party tells me to serve the people, and then I go to serve the people.
    Just as Chairman Mao said: "We cannot immediately understand what we feel, and only what we understand can we feel more deeply." At this time, I felt that my understanding and consciousness of serving the people was a step forward compared to the past. To Serve the People, We Must Establish a Revolutionary Worldview
    I began to understand the principle that serving the people is determined by the nature of the Party, but it does not mean that I can serve the people wholeheartedly. The facts are far from it!
    After I started commercial work in January 1957, I was rated as an advanced worker in the store for several consecutive quarters. Every time I attended the advanced worker award ceremony, I was very excited and felt very honored. After the meeting, I was very motivated. However, in the spring of 1958, the Shenyang City Trade Company system held an advanced worker conference. Because my work performance was not outstanding compared to the entire company system, I was not rated as a formal representative to attend the company's advanced worker conference. In order to educate me, the leaders asked me to attend the conference as a nonvoting delegate. I didn't know I wasn't a formal delegate before the meeting. When I arrived at the venue and learned that I was attending the meeting as a nonvoting delegate, it caused a great fluctuation in my thinking. My emotions were not high, and I felt that it was not good to be a nonvoting delegate; I also secretly complained to the leaders that I was not qualified to be a formal delegate, so I shouldn't have been asked to come. What is the problem? This shows that I mixed falsehood into serving the people. On the one hand, I was serving the people, and on the other hand, I was pursuing personal things; after doing a little work, I reached out to the leaders for honors and praise; when I didn't get them, I was unhappy. This kind of thinking itself proves that I am not qualified to be a formal representative to attend the company's conference.
    In subsequent learning and work practice, I gradually realized this problem: To serve the people wholeheartedly, we must have the correct motive, we must hand over everything to the Party and the people, live for the revolution, and die for the revolution; we must learn from Comrade Bethune and achieve "utter devotion to others without any thought of self" and "extreme responsibility towards work and extreme warmth towards comrades and the people." When I thought this way and worked hard towards this goal, my ideological burden was much less, and I was more motivated than before. I no longer worried about whether the leaders knew about my work, whether I could be praised, or whether I could attend the advanced worker conference.
    Everyone calls the question of who to work for and why to live a worldview question. I deeply realize that establishing a revolutionary worldview is indeed the most important thing.
    If a revolutionary worldview has not been firmly established, can one serve the people? My experience is: yes and no. One can serve the people under favorable conditions, but not under difficult conditions; one can serve the people temporarily or in certain things, but not always in everything; one can serve the people when it does not harm personal interests, but not when the interests of the Party and personal interests conflict. It is not difficult for a person to do a good thing temporarily, but it is difficult to do good things for the people for a lifetime. I think: If there is any difference between Communist Party members and ordinary people, it is that Communist Party members can consciously be不怕吃苦 (bù pà chī kǔ) and不怕牺牲 (bù pà xīshēng), serve the people for a lifetime, and do good things for a lifetime.
    In recent years, the higher-level organizations have transferred some young comrades to our store. They all just graduated from school. Before leaving school, they had great ambitions to dedicate their youth to the people. After they started working, most of them were enthusiastic, active, and motivated. However, there are also a very few people who become emotional when they are assigned to the store, are not at ease with their work, and think that being a salesperson is inferior and that they are wasting their talents in this job; they say that the conditions are not suitable! They cannot exert their role! They find some excuses and are unwilling to serve the people unconditionally. Why does this kind of thinking and emotion arise? The most important thing is that they have not established a revolutionary worldview. The motive for them to participate in work was not originally to serve the people wholeheartedly, but to serve the people conditionally. People whose revolutionary worldview is not firm will be very motivated and work actively when the work assigned by the Party happens to coincide with their personal interests and hobbies, and they can also do some good things for the people; but they cannot withstand long-term tests. When the interests of the Party conflict with his personal interests, for example, when the Party transfers him to do another job that does not coincide with his personal interests and hobbies, he will bargain, and even if he goes, he will not be motivated. Chairman Mao said: "Things have great principles and small principles, and all small principles are governed by great principles." My experience is: Only after learning, practicing, and conscientiously transforming our thinking, establishing a revolutionary worldview, and understanding that we must consider every problem and conform to the interests of the Party in everything we do, will we be able to do whatever the Party needs us to do, love whatever line we work in, and delve into it.
    The revolutionary worldview is to serve the people wholeheartedly. Only by establishing a revolutionary worldview can we serve the people wholeheartedly; in other words, only those who serve the people wholeheartedly can firmly establish a revolutionary worldview. To Serve the People, We Must Dare to Struggle Against Difficulties
    Serving the people is not smooth sailing, and one always encounters various difficulties. Revolution is to overthrow the old social system and change the relationship between people; construction is to develop production and build our new country. These things are very arduous and difficult. To achieve victory, we must struggle against difficulties; we must endure great hardship and endure great labor, and we must be willing to sacrifice. I think this way: The reason why there are Communist Parties in the world is because there are difficulties in the world—the system of people exploiting people and people oppressing people, the working people cannot eat enough, wear enough, and suffer, and they need the Communist Party to lead everyone to stand up and liberate themselves. I further thought: In our socialist country, the working people have stood up and liberated themselves, but we still need to carry out construction, there must be various industries, some people do this work, and some people do that work, and this is also to further solve the difficulties for the people. Taking our non-staple food store as an example, it is to solve the difficulties in life for the people. To solve the difficulties in life for the people, we will encounter some other difficulties: In the peak season, a large amount of vegetables are on the market, and if they are not handled well, they will rot, causing losses to the country; in the off-season, there are fewer vegetables, and if we do not actively organize the supply of goods, they will be out of stock. When starting a new job, we don't understand and can't do it at first, and we will make mistakes, which is also a difficulty. Difficulties like this are everywhere. Precisely because of this, Chairman Mao told us: "What is work? Work is struggle. Those places have difficulties and problems that need us to solve. We work and struggle to solve difficulties."
    The facts have also repeatedly told me: Overcoming difficulties is the only way to serve the people wholeheartedly. In the summer of 1958, it was the peak season for vegetables, and there were many varieties and quantities of vegetables on the market. In normal weather, we had to go out to sell vegetables every day and deliver them to the doors of the masses. Once, it rained, and I only thought: The road is slippery in the rain, and I will get my clothes wet, so I didn't go out to deliver vegetables. After the rain, the secretary of the store's Party branch, Comrade Wang Shikai, asked me: "Did you go out to deliver vegetables in the rain?" I said: "No. There are plenty of good days, so why bother going out to deliver vegetables in the rain." Comrade Wang Shikai then asked me: "Do you eat vegetables on rainy days?" At this time, my face was burning. I realized that I was being blocked by difficulties. On rainy days, I only thought that it was inconvenient and troublesome for me to go out to deliver vegetables, but I didn't think that it was even more inconvenient for the masses to eat vegetables precisely because it was raining; the more it rains, the more difficult it is to sell vegetables, the easier it is for them to rot, and the more losses will be caused to the country. After that, we insisted on going out to deliver vegetables whenever it rained. We overcame the difficulties ourselves, and we brought convenience to the masses. The masses were truly happy when they saw us delivering vegetables to their doors in the rain.
    Before the Spring Festival in 1960, in order to ensure the supply of vegetables during the Spring Festival, our store transferred some comrades to the suburbs, which were forty to fifty miles away from the city, to buy vegetables, and I signed up to participate. The weather was very cold at this time, and the wind was very strong, making it difficult to ride a bicycle against the wind. Every time I returned to the store, I felt pain in my back and legs. Should I continue to go, or should I not go? The ideological struggle began. If I don't go, I can suffer less, but it will affect the masses' ability to eat vegetables. If I go, I will suffer a little, but it will bring convenience to the masses. When I thought: This is precisely my opportunity to serve the masses; to serve the masses, there must be difficulties, I made up my mind to move forward in the face of difficulties and continue to participate in this work.
    Another time, a sewer construction site near our store had a very urgent construction task, and the workers urgently needed cotton shoes and cotton gloves, but they had not had time to buy them. I planned to deliver the cotton shoes and cotton gloves to the construction site the next night. Unfortunately, it snowed heavily the next day, and the weather was also very cold. I thought: Because it is snowing, it is not possible not to deliver them, but rather we must deliver them. Because the colder the weather, the more the workers need cold protection supplies. So, I and a comrade from the store, braving the heavy snow, delivered the cold protection supplies to the construction site. The workers said with emotion: "This is truly a timely help! We must work harder to ensure the completion of the task ahead of schedule."
    These things made me understand this principle: Just talking about serving the people in words, but not being able to overcome difficulties in actual work, makes it impossible to serve the people. The process of serving the people is a process of constantly overcoming difficulties. Every time we overcome a difficulty, our thinking on serving the people improves one step, and we also taste the sweetness of serving the people once. The more difficulties we overcome, the more solid our thinking on serving the people becomes. To Serve the People, We Must Correctly Treat Mistakes and Criticism
    Serving the people is doing beneficial things for the people, so we must do work. However, doing work may sometimes make mistakes. People who don't work won't make the mistakes we are talking about, but they make a bigger mistake, which is not serving the people. Serving the people, due to insufficient experience and limitations in the level of understanding, sometimes inevitably makes some mistakes. Chairman Mao said: "Any political party, any individual, mistakes are always unavoidable, and we ask to make fewer mistakes. If we make mistakes, we ask to correct them, and the more quickly, thoroughly, and better we correct them, the better." My understanding of Chairman Mao's words is: People who serve the people wholeheartedly are not those who never make mistakes, but those who can have a correct attitude and correct them quickly when they make mistakes.
    If you make a mistake, do you hide it and forgive yourself? Or do you expose it and quickly correct it? This is a very important question for whether you can serve the people wholeheartedly.
    Last spring, I made two mistakes in my work. Once, when selling winter melon, I misread the price tag and undercharged the customer; another time, when selling cucumber, I misremembered the price and overcharged the customer. This kind of phenomenon is a business accident in the store. Undercharging causes losses to the state; overcharging increases the burden on customers and also affects the prestige of socialist commerce. No one else knew about the two mistakes I made. At the end of the month, when evaluating the comprehensive award, everyone unanimously agreed that I should get the first prize. My ideological struggle began: Should I talk about the two times I sold the wrong price? If I tell them, will everyone think that I am an advanced worker, but I still sold the wrong price, losing face. But then I thought: If I don't tell them, I am hiding my mistakes, and hiding mistakes is adding a bit of falsehood to the revolution, which is irresponsible to the Party and the people, has no educational effect on myself, and will also add a stain to myself. I exposed my two mistakes of selling the wrong price in front of everyone. Some comrades even wanted to forgive me, saying that we should look at the main things; evaluating a month's work, we can't just look at that little bit; if other aspects are good, we should still be rated as the first prize. I explained to everyone the principle that we cannot forgive mistakes, and as a result, everyone agreed that I should not be rated as the first prize. My exposure and criticism of my own mistakes made me take another step forward in serving the people; at the same time, it also made everyone accept a lesson from the two mistakes, and realized that we, as salespersons, must be serious and responsible for every transaction, and cannot be careless; we must make all preparations before opening the business and carefully familiarize ourselves with the price tags in order to serve the people quickly and accurately.
    Also, what attitude we take towards other people's criticisms is also a touchstone for testing whether we can serve the people wholeheartedly. In 1963, at a group meeting, comrades gave me two criticisms. One was: I care more about the masses outside the store than the comrades inside the store. Some people think that I do this in order to get praise from the masses. The other was: The study meetings and work discussion meetings I presided over took too long; the reason why the meetings were long was because I had fewer family burdens and did not consider the difficulties of others who had many children to take care of. When I first heard this, I felt very uncomfortable. I felt that I had done nothing wrong, and that the comrades who made the suggestions were too poorly aware, and that they only considered personal issues. The more I thought this way, the more wronged I felt. When I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, I realized that my thoughts and attitudes were wrong. Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, anyone can point them out to us. As long as what you say is right, we will correct it. If the method you say is beneficial to the people, we will follow your method." I was thinking about serving the people wholeheartedly, so how could I not seriously consider and humbly treat other people's criticisms? I thought about it carefully: The reason why the comrades made criticisms was to help me and hope that I would do my job well. The opinions of the comrades were not entirely correct, but some of them were reasonable and worth considering. Taking my caring for the masses outside the store more than the comrades inside the store as an example, it is certainly right for me to do this, because we are salespersons of socialist commerce, and we should have the style of setting an example and putting others first, but I have not repeatedly promoted this principle to everyone. If I made the principle clear to everyone, the comrades would do the same themselves, and there would be no objections. Besides, I really haven't done enough to care for the comrades in the store. After I thought this way, my mood calmed down. I talked more with the comrades and helped solve some practical difficulties. Whenever a meeting was to be held, some things were discussed and brewed before the meeting, and the meeting time was shorter than before. In this way, I realized: We must also stand on the correct position when treating other people's criticisms. If we stand on the position of individualism, the more we consider, the more we go astray. If we can't figure it out, our mistakes and shortcomings cannot be changed, and we will also have opinions about others, and as a result, we will become even more divorced from the masses. If we consider from the standpoint of the Party and the people, we will see other people's criticisms as help to ourselves. By accepting correct criticisms, we will have one less shortcoming; even if the criticisms are incorrect, serious consideration can also play a role in preventing and promoting. Some comrades said that I did some things for the masses in order to get praise from others. Although I didn't have this idea at the time, having this criticism can make me vigilant and prevent this shortcoming from happening in the future.
    This is the case with dealing with mistakes and criticisms, and the same is true with dealing with achievements and praises. If one's work or study has achieved some results and has been encouraged by the Party and praised by the people, one becomes complacent and thinks that it is almost enough and that there is no need to work diligently anymore, then this also means that one is not serving the people wholeheartedly, or that the thinking of serving the people wholeheartedly has begun to fade. The beginning of complacency is the beginning of going downhill. This is as dangerous as not being able to correctly treat one's own mistakes and criticisms! To Serve the People, We Must Diligently Practice Solid Skills
    In our country, no matter what kind of work we do, it is serving the people. This is the same place for all work. However, each industry has its own business work. Factories and stores are different; among stores, non-staple food stores and department stores are different. To serve the people wholeheartedly, we must also be familiar with our own business and constantly improve our business and technical level. As a salesperson, one generally needs to master commodity knowledge and learn techniques such as weighing, calculating, packaging, and bundling. Selling vegetables is relatively simple, but we can't do a good job without improving our business and technical level. Customers generally want to buy and leave quickly when they buy things. During holidays and festivals, everyone hopes to be able to buy things quickly. If the salesperson can't answer what the customer asks, or the action is too slow or the packaging is not good, even if the salesperson's service attitude is good and thinks of the customer thoughtfully, it will cause customer dissatisfaction. When I first learned to sell vegetables, I sometimes had to receive several customers at the same time. Some customers chose their vegetables and waited for me to weigh them. When they saw me being slow, they put down the vegetables and left dissatisfied. Sometimes, when customers asked me what kind of vegetables go well with what kind of dishes or what kind of meat, I couldn't answer. These things made me think: Just having the enthusiasm to serve the people is not enough, we must also develop the skills to serve the people. As a vegetable salesperson, we must not only understand the needs of customers, but also be familiar with vegetables and understand how to eat them and what vegetables go well with what dishes. The difficulty I encountered at the time was that I didn't know how to match dishes and knew too little about how to eat vegetables. I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and learned things that I didn't understand from all insiders. I took various questions raised by customers to a nearby canteen and asked experienced old chefs for advice. With the support of the Party branch, I also linked up with old salespersons with decades of experience in various industries to impart their experience, and launched "bao jiao bao xue" (包教保学, guaranteed teaching and learning) and business and technical activities in the entire store. Comrades have made great improvements in accounting, chopping meat, and skewering fish, and the quality of service has been greatly improved. I myself also felt that I had some ways to serve the people, and I was able to turn my desire to serve the people into reality more.
    Of course, to be meticulous in business and technology, one cannot do without firmly establishing the idea of serving the people. With the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, you can learn if you don't know how, you can delve into if you don't understand, and you can fully exert its role when you learn the skills. To Serve the People, We Must Rely on Everyone
    The revolutionary cause is everyone's business; everyone's business must be handled by everyone. Taking our non-staple food store as an example, the vegetable team sells vegetables, and customers buy delicious vegetables from the salesperson. From the form, it is just the salesperson serving the customer. In fact, if you think about it carefully, selling a Chinese cabbage to a customer, we are only doing a small part of the work for the customer and providing a part of the service to the customer. A lot of work has been done by others. First of all, the farmers produced the vegetables, and then they went through many procedures such as transportation, storage, and sorting before they reached our hands. The same is true for selling a pound of pork to a customer. Without the many people in front serving the people, there would be no way for our non-staple food store to serve the people. I think it is very important to understand this principle, to be able to properly estimate the role of our work, and to know that serving the people depends on everyone.
    Taking the internal work of our store as an example, the store's work can only be done well if everyone consciously serves the people. Under the education of the Party and the help of comrades, I have only made a little achievement, but the Party and the people have given me a lot of honors. For a period of time, many customers wrote letters and came to the store to find me, asking me to help them solve some special needs. Such as prescribing medicine for treatment, requiring turtle, chicken gall, pig brain, sodium-free soy sauce, etc., and some customers sometimes bought vegetables in other groups and wanted me to tie them up. It should be said that this is the trust and encouragement of the masses in me. Over time, I thought of this problem: We cannot simply regard this phenomenon as praise for me; on the contrary, we should regard it as criticism of me. Because I am a Communist Party member and have been rated as an advanced worker many times, but I have not motivated the comrades around me. If everyone is more consciously serving the masses, wouldn't customers come to everyone for help when they have problems? When I paid attention to studying Chairman Mao's works with everyone and publicizing our responsibility as salespersons, and many comrades consciously stood up to help the masses solve their difficulties, the situation became different. I alone have only one brain and two hands. In the past, many of the things that customers asked me to do were not done, which delayed the urgent needs of customers and disappointed the masses' hope for socialist commerce. Some comrades in the store also had opinions. When everyone does it together, the comrades are in high spirits, and the special needs of customers are more satisfied. This made me deeply realize: "One person is red, red a little; a little red, red a piece; every piece is red, red fills the store." To serve the people wholeheartedly, everyone must first start from themselves, study hard, work actively, and not be afraid of difficulties; but this is not enough, we must mobilize everyone to work together. Only in this way can we better serve the people; and the people can also feel the Party's concern for them from our work. Stand at the Counter, Have the Motherland in Mind, and Have the World in View
    Do people like us who work in non-staple food stores only serve customers who buy goods? Do we only serve those who buy goods, and not serve those who don't buy goods? I don't think it's entirely like this. We must also serve the vast majority of people in China and the world through our work. It would be too narrow if we limited our vision to the area around the counter.
    Chairman Mao often taught us: China is a large country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and a population that accounts for a quarter of the world's population. Our country bears important internationalist obligations, and we should and can make more and greater contributions to the world revolution.
    Our work is indeed ordinary. We deal with non-staple foods all day long, three cents for vinegar and two cents for green onions, and some transactions are as small as one cent. We will not produce any important products, nor will we have any major inventions or creations. However, this work of ours is a part of revolutionary work, and it is indispensable to building socialism. Workers on the steel front, soldiers guarding the national defense, scientific and cultural workers, street residents, and elementary school students, no one does not need non-staple food. If we solve their problems of eating and using well, so that they can concentrate on production, work, and study, then we are serving the cause of socialist revolution and construction. Furthermore, farmers produce vegetables, chickens, ducks, meat, eggs, and other products, and we sell them for them, which will promote the development of production. All of this directly increases the strength of revolution and construction. The stronger our country's construction is, the more power we will have to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.
    Small and large are interconnected. Some things seem small on the surface, but they are of great significance. For example: If our work in managing pork is not done well, on the one hand, people in cities and industrial and mining areas will not be able to eat fresh meat; on the other hand, farmers will not be able to sell their pigs, which will affect the development of pigs; if there are fewer pigs, it will affect fertilizer; if there is less fertilizer, it will directly affect the development of grain production and economic crops. Of course, it will also bring unfavorable effects to supporting the world revolution.
    I deeply realize that under the same conditions, doing the same work, the results are different due to different focuses. Standing by the counter and only seeing the inside and outside of the counter will make you do your work as a purely economic work and a business work; the more you do it, the narrower your vision becomes. If your vision is narrow, you will forget that you are doing revolutionary work, forget about class and class struggle. Commercial work is inherently very business-oriented, and we deal with goods and money every day. If we don't stand tall and see far, selling for money and completing tasks, the result will be that we unconsciously embark on the capitalist path of simply pursuing profits, causing bad influences on the Party and the socialist system.
    Standing at the counter, having the motherland in mind, and having the world in view will be a different situation. We will do commercial work as political work: doing business for the revolution, standing at the counter for the revolution, and selling vegetables for the revolution for a lifetime; we will always think that two-thirds of the world's population has not been liberated; starting from the big picture and starting from the small things, establishing solid political views, mass views, and production views, and striving to do our job well, to better serve the vast majority of people in China and the world.
                              ×　×　×
    I have talked about some of my experiences in studying "Serve the People" above. I think solving the above problems can better serve the people wholeheartedly. Comrade Lei Feng wrote in his diary: "Human life is limited, but serving the people is unlimited." Checking my own thoughts and actions, I have not done enough in serving the people wholeheartedly; even the problems that I have realized, I have not fully achieved. However, I am determined to study "Serve the People" for a lifetime, strive in the direction indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao, and be a commercial worker who serves the people wholeheartedly.

    在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，几年来，我坚持学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的指示去做，在思想改造和工作方面，都有了一些进步。特别是反复学习《为人民服务》等文章，使我逐步懂得了：人的一生，应该是革命的一生，斗争的一生，学习的一生，为人民服务的一生。现在，谈谈我学习《为人民服务》的几点体会。为人民服务，是党的性质决定的
    一九五八年，我开始学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》这两篇文章。当时，我对商业工作的重要性认识不足，觉得当营业员天天同秤杆秤盘打交道，卖的东西净是些白菜、萝卜和油盐酱醋，这对社会主义建设有多大关系啊！还不如到工厂造机器、到工地盖大楼有意义。因此，思想上有些苦闷。应该怎样认识和对待自己的工作？我带着这个问题学习《为人民服务》。毛主席在这篇文章中表扬了张思德同志，说他是我们队伍中的一位好同志。“张思德同志是为人民利益而死的，他的死是比泰山还要重的。”毛主席还教导我们要不怕困难。“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”这些话使我受到很大教育，我开始知道革命工作没有高低贵贱之分；当营业员是社会主义建设和人民利益需要的。我想：为了革命，张思德同志献出了自己的生命，我对待工作就应该不挑不拣，不怕困难。毛主席教导我们要为人民服务，我就应该听党的话。
    从这以后，我反复地学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《毛泽东选集》中的其他文章，对于为什么要全心全意地为人民服务，怎样才能做到全心全意地为人民服务，又有了进一步的认识。
    毛主席说：“为什么要有革命党？因为世界上有压迫人民的敌人存在，人民要推翻敌人的压迫，所以要有革命党。”还说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”这使我懂得了：全心全意地为人民服务，是党的性质和目的决定的。党生来就是为人民服务的；除了全心全意地为人民服务，没有别的目的。读了毛主席的书，再想一想实际情况，就觉得心里更亮堂。我想：解放前，党领导全国人民进行推翻三座大山的斗争，现在又领导全国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，这些都是全心全意地为人民服务的集中表现。正因为党是为人民服务的，什么事都想到群众、做到群众心里去，为人民兴利除害，群众就从心眼里拥护党。有了群众的拥护和爱戴，党也就能够从小到大的发展，在革命和建设中，取得一个又一个的胜利。我还想到：区别共产党和别的党有什么不同，可以有许多标准，但是，最根本的标准，就是共产党是全心全意地为人民服务的党，“完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”从古到今，别的任何政党都做不到。
    当我懂得了这些道理的时候，我就想：党是由党员组成的。党的全心全意地为人民服务的性质和目的，是要由千千万万个党员每时每刻为人民服务来实现的。我是一个共产党员，我的义务就是要全心全意地为人民服务；我为人民服务的岗位，就是营业员工作。我把营业员工作做好了，就有利于实现党的为人民服务的目的；能够通过我们的手把党的温暖送到群众的心上，使群众更加热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义制度。这样我就要求自己应该是自觉地为人民服务，而不是被动地为人民服务。我认为：仅仅一般地理解党叫我去为人民服务，才去为人民服务，那还是不够的。
    正象毛主席说的：“感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它”。这时，我觉得我对于为人民服务的理解和自觉性比过去就前进了一步。为人民服务，必须树立革命的世界观
    我开始懂得了为人民服务是党的本性决定的道理，还不等于我能够做到全心全意地为人民服务。事实还差得远呢！
    一九五七年一月我参加商业工作后，连续几个季度，被评为商店的先进工作者。我每一次参加先进工作者发奖大会，都很兴奋，觉得很光荣。开过会后，干劲也很大。但是，到了一九五八年春天，沈阳市贸易公司系统开先进工作者大会，因为在全公司系统比较，我的工作成绩不突出，没有被评为出席公司先进工作者大会的正式代表。领导为了使我受到教育，要我列席了大会。会前我不知道自己不是正式代表，当我到了会场知道是列席会议时，在思想上引起了很大的波动，情绪不高，觉得不是正式代表，面子上不好看；还暗地埋怨领导，我不够正式代表，就不应该叫我来。这是个什么问题呢？这说明：我在为人民服务中，是掺了假的。一方面在为人民服务，一方面又追求个人的东西；做了点工作，就伸手向领导要荣誉，要表扬；得不到的时候，就不高兴。这种思想本身，就证明自己不够出席公司大会的正式代表的资格。
    在以后的学习和工作实践中，我逐步认识到这样一个问题：要做到全心全意地为人民服务，就要有正确的动机，就要把自己的一切交给党，交给人民，为革命而生，为革命而死；要向白求恩同志学习，做到：“毫不利己专门利人”、“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”当我这样想，也向这样的目标去努力的时候，我的思想包袱就少得多了，干劲也比过去更足了，再也不为做了工作领导是不是知道、能不能受到表扬、能不能参加先进工作者大会去担心了。
    大家都把为谁工作、为什么活着叫做是世界观问题。我深深体会到，树立革命的世界观，的确是第一件大事。
    革命的世界观还没有牢固地树立起来，能不能为人民服务？我的体会是：能够，也不能够。能够在顺利的条件下为人民服务，不能够在困难的条件下为人民服务；能够一时一地或在某几件事情上为人民服务，而不能够永远地在任何事情上都为人民服务；能够在不损害个人利益的时候为人民服务，而不能够在党的利益和个人利益发生矛盾的时候为人民服务。一个人一时一地做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子为人民做好事。我想：如果说共产党员和一般群众有什么不同的话，那就是：共产党员能够自觉地不怕吃苦、不怕牺牲，为人民服务一辈子，做一辈子好事。
    近几年来，上级组织给我们商店调来一些青年同志。他们都是刚从学校毕业出来的。在出校门之前，就有着雄心壮志，要把自己的青春献给人民。他们参加工作后，绝大多数人热情、积极、上进心强。但是，也有极少数人，分配到商店来的时候，却闹情绪，不安心工作，认为当营业员低人一等，自己干这个工作屈材；说什么条件不合适啦！不能发挥自己的作用啦！找一些借口，不愿无条件地为人民服务。为什么会产生这种思想情绪呢？最主要的就是没有树立起革命的世界观。他们参加工作的动机，本来就不是全心全意地为人民服务，而是有条件地为人民服务。革命世界观不牢固的人，当党分配的工作，恰好同个人的兴趣爱好一致的时候，干劲很大，积极工作，也能为人民做些好事；但是经不起长期的考验。到了党的利益同他个人的利益发生矛盾的时候，比方说，党调动他去作另一种工作，这种工作同他个人的兴趣爱好不一致时，他就会讲价钱，去了也鼓不起干劲。毛主席说：“事情有大道理，有小道理，一切小道理都归大道理管着。”我的体会是：只有经过学习、实践、认真地改造思想，树立起革命的世界观，懂得了我们做每一件事，考虑每一个问题，都要符合党的利益，才会做到党需要干什么，就去干什么，干一行，爱一行，钻一行。
    革命的世界观，就是全心全意地为人民服务。只有树立起革命的世界观，才会做到全心全意地为人民服务；换句话说，也只有全心全意地为人民服务的人，才可能牢固地树立起革命的世界观。为人民服务，要敢于同困难作斗争
    为人民服务，不是一帆风顺的，总是要遇到各种各样的困难。革命，就是要推翻旧的社会制度，改变人和人的关系；搞建设，就是要发展生产，建设我们的新国家。这些事，都是十分艰巨困难的。要得到胜利，就要同困难作斗争；就要吃大苦、耐大劳，就要有牺牲。我这样想：世界上所以要有共产党，就是因为世界上有困难——有人剥削人、人压迫人的制度，劳动人民吃不饱、穿不暖，受苦受难，需要有共产党领导大家起来翻身解放。我还进一步想：在我们社会主义国家里，劳动人民翻身解放了，但还要搞建设，要有这种那种行业，有的人干这种工作，有的人干那种工作，这也是要为人民进一步解决困难。拿我们副食品商店来说，就是为人民解决生活困难的。我们要为人民解决生活中的困难，在我们面前就会遇到另外一些困难：旺季，蔬菜大量上市，处理不好，就要烂掉，给国家造成损失；淡季，蔬菜少了，不积极组织货源，就会脱销。干一件新的工作，开始不懂不会干，会干出差错来，也是困难。象这样的困难到处都是。正因为这样，毛主席告诉我们：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”
    事实也一再告诉我：克服了困难，才能作到全心全意地为人民服务。一九五八年夏天，正是蔬菜旺季，上市的菜，品种多，数量也多。正常天气，我们每天都要出去卖菜，把菜送到群众门上。有一次，天下雨了，我只想到：雨天路滑，又要湿衣服，就没有出去送菜。雨后，商店党支部书记王士凯同志问我：“雨天，你们出去送菜没有？”我说：“没有。好天有的是，还用得着雨天出去送菜。”王士凯同志接着问我：“下雨天，你吃不吃菜？”这时，我的脸火辣辣的。我认识到自己是被困难挡住了。雨天，我只想到自己出去送菜不方便、麻烦，没有想到，正是下了雨，群众吃菜才更不方便；越是雨天，菜卖不出去，容易腐烂，才会给国家造成损失。这以后，每逢雨天，我们都坚持出去送菜。我们自己克服了困难，就把方便送给了群众，群众看见下雨天我们把菜送上门去，真有说不出来的高兴。
    一九六○年春节前，为了保证春节的蔬菜供应，我们商店抽调一部分同志到离市内四、五十里路的郊区去买菜，我报名参加了。这时天气很冷，风很大，迎着风骑脚踏车很吃力。每次回到商店都觉得腰酸腿痛。继续去，还是不去？思想上斗争起来。不去，我自己可以少受些累，但是对群众吃菜有影响。去了，我自己受些累，就会给群众带来方便。当我想到：这正是我为群众服务的机会；为群众服务就不能没有困难，我就下决心迎着困难前进，继续坚持参加这一工作。
    还有一次，我们商店附近一个下水道工地，施工任务很紧急，工人急需的棉胶鞋、棉手套，还没来得及购买。我预定在第二天晚上把棉胶鞋、棉手套送到工地去。不巧第二天下了大雪，天气也很冷。我想：下雪了，不是可以不去送，而是更要去送。因为天气越冷，工人越需要防寒用品。于是，我和门市部一位同志一起，冒着大雪把防寒用品送到工地。工人感动地说：“这真是雪里送炭！我们一定要加把劲做好工作，保证提前完成任务。”
    这些事，使我懂得了这样一个道理：光是在口头上讲为人民服务，在实际工作中不能克服困难，就没法做到为人民服务。为人民服务的过程，就是一个不断克服困难的过程。每克服一次困难，自己为人民服务的思想就提高了一步，也就尝到一次为人民服务的甜头。克服的困难越多，为人民服务的思想就越牢靠。为人民服务，要正确地对待错误和批评
    为人民服务，是为人民做有利的事，就要做工作。但是，做工作有时就可能犯错误。不做工作的人，不会犯我们说的错误，但是他犯了个更大的错误，就是不为人民服务。为人民服务，由于经验不够和受认识水平的限制，有时就难免犯一点错误。毛主席说：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我对毛主席这句话的领会是：全心全意地为人民服务的人，不是他从来不会犯错误，而是由于他犯了错误能够有个正确的态度，能够很快地改正。
    犯了错误，是隐瞒下来，原谅自己？还是揭发出来，迅速改正？这对于能不能够做到全心全意地为人民服务，是个很重要的问题。
    去年春季，我在工作中出了两个差错，一次卖冬瓜，看错了牌价，少收了钱；又一次，卖黄瓜，记错了价，多收了钱。这种现象在商店里是营业事故。少收了钱，给国家造成损失；多收了钱，增加了顾客的负担，对社会主义商业的威信也有影响。我发生这两次差错，别人都不知道。月终评综合奖时，大家一致评我应得一等奖。我的思想斗争开了：两次卖错价钱，讲不讲呢？讲出来，大家会不会认为我是先进工作者，还卖错价钱，丢面子。但是又一想：不讲出来，就是隐瞒自己的错误，隐瞒错误，就是给革命掺一分假，这对党对人民是不负责任，对自己也没有教育作用，还会给自己身上增加一个污点。我在大家面前揭露了自己两次卖错价钱的错误。有的同志还要原谅我，说看问题要看主要的；评一个月的工作，不能只看那么一点点；其他方面好，还应该评为一等奖。我向大家说明对待错误不能原谅的道理，结果大家同意不应评一等奖。我这样揭发、批评了自己的错误，就使自己在为人民服务方面又前进了一步；同时，还使大家从两次出差错中接受了教训，认识到我们当营业员的，做每一笔交易，都要认真负责，不能有一点粗心大意；开业前要做好一切准备，认真熟悉牌价，做到迅速准确地为人民服务。
    还有，对待别人的批评意见，采取什么态度，也是检验能不能做到全心全意地为人民服务的试金石。一九六三年，在一次小组会上，同志们给我提出两条批评意见。一条是：我对于商店内同志们的关心，没有对商店外的群众关心得多。有的人认为我是为了想得到群众的表扬才这样做的。另一条是：我主持开学习会和讨论工作的会，时间拖得太长；会议所以长，是因为我自己家庭负担少，就不考虑别人孩子多需要照顾的困难。我乍一听，心里很难受。觉得自己没有过错，是提意见的同志觉悟太低了，她们光考虑个人问题。我越这样想，就越觉得是自己受了委屈。当我想到毛主席的教导时，我就觉察自己这种想法和态度不对头。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”我一心想着要为人民服务，怎么就不能认真考虑、虚心对待别人的批评呢？我仔细想了一下：同志们所以提出批评，是要帮助我，希望我把工作做好。同志们提的意见不全对，有一些也是有道理的，值得我考虑。拿我关心商店外的群众比商店内的同志多一些来说，我这样做固然是对的，因为我们是社会主义商业的营业员，办事应当有以身作则、先人后己的风格，但是我没有把这个道理反复向大家宣传。把道理向大家讲清楚了，同志们就会自己也这样做，更不会有意见。再说，我对商店内同志们的关心，也确实还做得不够。我这样想了以后，心情就平静下来。更多地和同志们谈心，并且帮助解决一些实际困难问题。每逢要开会，有些事在会前串连酝酿，会议时间就比过去缩短了。这样我就认识到：对待别人的批评，也要站在正确的立场上去考虑。站在个人主义的立场上，越考虑，就越往斜道上去。想不通，自己的错误和缺点不能改，还会对别人有意见，结果更加脱离群众。站在党和人民的立场上去考虑，就会把别人的批评看成是对自己的帮助。正确的批评，接受了，使自己少一条缺点；就是不正确的批评，认真考虑，也可以起到打预防针和促进的作用。有的同志说我为群众办了些事，是为了得到别人表扬。我虽然当时没有这个想法，但是有了这条批评意见，就可以使我警惕，在今后也不发生这个缺点。
    对待错误和批评是这样，对待成绩和表扬也是这样。如果自己的工作或学习取得了一些成绩，受到党的鼓励和人民的称赞，就沾沾自喜，认为已经差不多了，不需要再勤勤恳恳努力了，那么，这也就意味着不是全心全意为人民服务，或者是全心全意为人民服务的思想开始褪色了。自满的开始，就是走下坡路的开始。这和不能正确对待自己的错误和批评是一样的危险！为人民服务，要苦练过硬的本领
    在我们国家里，不管干什么工作，都是为人民服务的。这是一切工作相同的地方。但是，各行各业都有自己的业务工作，工厂和商店不同；商店中，副食品商店和百货商店不同。我们要做到全心全意为人民服务，还必须熟悉自己的业务，不断提高业务、技术水平。当营业员，一般都要掌握商品知识，学会秤量、计算、包装、捆扎等技术。卖菜，比较简单，但是，不提高业务、技术水平，也做不好工作。顾客买东西，一般的心理，都希望快买快走。假期节日，每个人更希望能快些买到手。顾客问什么，营业员答不上，或者动作太慢、包扎不好，就是营业员的服务态度再好，为顾客想的再周到，也会引起顾客不满。我刚学卖菜时，有时要同时接待几位顾客，有的顾客选好了菜，等我过秤，他们看我慢慢腾腾，就把菜放下不满意地走了。有时，遇到顾客问我某一种菜配什么菜或什么肉好吃，我回答不出。这些事，使我想到：光有为人民服务的热情还不行，还必须练出一手为人民服务的本领。当一名卖菜的营业员，不但要了解顾客的要求，而且还要熟悉菜，了解什么菜应当怎样吃，什么菜配什么菜好吃。我当时遇到的困难是不会配菜，对菜的吃法懂得太少。我就按照毛主席教导的去做，学会自己不懂的东西，向一切内行人学习。我带着顾客提出的各种问题，到附近一个食堂向有烹调经验的老厨师请教。在党支部的支持下，我还串连了各行各业有几十年经验的老营业员传授经验，在全商店开展了“包教保学”、业务技术串连活动，同志们在算账、砍肉、串鱼等方面，都有很大改进，服务质量有很大提高。我自己也觉得为人民服务有了些办法，能够更多地把为人民服务的愿望变为现实。
    当然，要在业务技术方面精益求精，也离不开牢固地树立为人民服务的思想。有了全心全意地为人民服务的思想，不会可以去学，不懂可以去钻，学到了本领，也能充分发挥它的作用。为人民服务，要靠大家
    革命的事，是大家的事；大家的事，靠大家来办。拿我们副食品商店来说，菜组卖菜，顾客从营业员手中买到可口的菜，从形式上看，只是营业员为顾客服务。其实，仔细想一想，卖一棵大白菜给顾客，我们只是为顾客做了一少部分工作，为顾客服了一部分务。大量的工作是别人做了的。首先是农民兄弟生产出来的菜，以后又经过运输、储存、整理等许多手续，才到了我们手中。卖一斤猪肉给顾客也是这样。没有前面许许多多的人在为人民服务，我们副食品商店就没有办法为人民服务。我认为懂得这个道理很重要，能够适当地估计自己工作的作用，知道为人民服务要靠大家。
    再拿我们商店内部的工作来说，也只有大家都自觉地为人民服务，才可以把商店的工作做好。在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，我仅仅做出了一点成绩，但是党和人民给了我很多的荣誉。有一个时期，许多顾客写信和到商店来找我，要我帮助他们解决一些特殊需要。如治病配药，要用元鱼、鸡苦胆、猪脑子、无钠酱油，等等，还有的顾客有时在别的小组买了菜，要我给捆起来。应该说，这是群众对我的信任和鼓励。时间长了，我就想到这样一个问题：对于这种现象，不能仅仅把它看成是对我的表扬；相反，应该看成是对我的批评。因为我是共产党员，又多次被评为先进工作者，但是我没有把周围的同志都带动起来。如果大家都更自觉地为群众服务，顾客有了事情，不是就会找大家办吗？当我注意同大家一起学习毛主席著作、宣传我们当营业员的责任，许多同志自觉地起来帮助群众解决困难的时候，情况就不同了。我一个人，只有一个脑，两只手，过去顾客找我办的事，许多都没有办得到，耽误了顾客的急需，又辜负了群众对社会主义商业的希望，商店内有的同志还有意见。大家来办时，同志们情绪很高，顾客的特殊需要就较多地得到满足了。这使我深刻体会到：“一人红，红一点；点点红，红一片；片片红，红满店。”要全心全意地为人民服务，每个人首先要从自己做起，认真学习，积极工作，不怕困难；但是，光这样还不够，必须发动大家一起工作。这样才能更好地为人民服务；人民也能从我们的工作中体会到党对他们的关心。身在柜台，胸怀祖国，放眼世界
    象我们在副食品商店工作的人，为人民服务，是不是就只是为购买物品的顾客服务？谁买了东西就为谁服务，谁没买东西，就没有为谁服务。我认为不完全是这样。我们也要通过自己的工作为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务。如果把眼光仅仅限制在柜台周围，那就太狭窄了。
    毛主席经常教导我们：中国是一个大国，土地有九百六十万平方公里，人口占世界人口的四分之一，我国担负着重要的国际主义义务，我们应该也能够对世界革命作出更多更大的贡献。
    我们的工作的确是平凡的。整天同副食品打交道，三分钱的醋二分钱的葱，有的交易额小到一分钱。我们不会生产出什么重要产品来，也没有什么大的发明创造。但是，我们这个工作，是革命工作的一部分，建设社会主义少不了它。钢铁战线上的工人，保卫国防的战士，科学和文化工作者，街道居民，小学生，没有哪一个人不需要副食品。我们把他们吃的用的问题解决得好，让他们专心一意地去生产，去工作，去学习，这也就是我们为社会主义革命和建设事业服务了。再说，农民生产出蔬菜、鸡鸭、肉、蛋等产品，我们为他们推销出去，就会促进生产的发展。所有这些，都是直接增加了革命和建设的力量。我们的国家建设强大了，就更有力量支援世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    小和大是互相联系的。有些事情，从表面上看似乎很小，但意义很大。比如：我们经营猪肉，如果购销工作做得不好，一方面，城市和工矿的人吃不上鲜肉；另一方面农民的猪卖不出去，就会影响猪的发展；猪少了，就影响到肥料；肥料少了，就直接影响到粮食生产和经济作物生产的发展。当然，对支援世界革命也会带来不利的影响。
    我深深体会到：在同样条件下，做同样的工作，由于着眼点不同，结果就不同。站在柜台旁，只看到柜台的里里外外，就会把自己的工作，当做单纯的经济工作、业务工作来做；越做眼光越狭窄。眼光窄了，就会忘记自己做的是革命工作，忘记了阶级和阶级斗争。商业工作本来业务性很强，天天同货物和钱打交道，我们再站不高，看不远，为了卖钱而卖钱，为了完成任务而完成任务，结果就会不自觉地走上单纯追求利润的资本主义方向，给党和社会主义制度造成不好的影响。
    身在柜台，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，就会是另外一种情况。就会把商业工作当做政治工作去做：为了革命做生意，为了革命站柜台，为了革命卖一辈子菜；就会时时刻刻想到世界上还有三分之二的人口没有解放；从大处着眼，小处着手，树立牢固的政治观点、群众观点和生产观点，努力做好自己的工作，更好地为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务。
                              ×　×　×
    我在上面谈了自己学习《为人民服务》的一些体会。我认为解决了以上几个问题，可以更好地全心全意地为人民服务。雷锋同志在日记中写道：“人的生命是有限的，可是，为人民服务是无限的”。检查我自己的思想和行动，在全心全意地为人民服务方面还做得很不够；就是自己认识到的问题，也还没有全部做到。但是，我有决心学习一辈子《为人民服务》，遵照党和毛主席指示的方向去努力，做一名全心全意地为人民服务的商业工作者。
