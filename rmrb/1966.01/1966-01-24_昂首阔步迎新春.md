    Striding Forward to Greet the New Spring
    As we welcome the New Spring, comrades are all inspired by the achievements of our motherland's socialist revolution and socialist construction. As an athlete, every time I think of the great achievements of the motherland and look at myself, although I have made some efforts in sports, my progress still falls far short of the demands of the Party and the people.
    Under the sunshine and nurturing of the Party, I have been cultivated into an athlete with a certain level of ideological and technical skill. Through numerous domestic and international competitions, I have come to realize more and more deeply that as a youth of New China, if I want to achieve something in the socialist cause, if I want to become a person who is beneficial to the people, I must arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought.
    When our badminton team first arrived in Northern Europe, I had some personal distracting thoughts. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I established the confidence to dare to struggle and dare to win, and enhanced my sense of political responsibility. I thought about how, over the years, the organization has helped me improve my ideological consciousness, and comrades have enthusiastically and selflessly taught me to master techniques and improve my level. The organization has placed great expectations on me, hoping that I can become an athlete who contributes to the people. Looking at the word "China" printed on the sportswear for overseas competitions, I felt an even greater sense of responsibility. I should display the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people on the court. Even if I cannot win in terms of score, I must make the opposing athletes and the audience see the tenacious fighting spirit and noble style of Chinese athletes. Moreover, I believe that I, who have grown up under the cultivation of the Party, dare to fight hard.
    During the preparation period before going abroad, my ideological improvement and political gains were the most important. The consolidation and improvement of technology only ranked second. After arriving in Copenhagen, all our team members also held a special discussion on "What is the ideal of youth in the Mao Zedong era?" Our badminton team competed a total of thirty-four games against the Danish team and the Swedish team, and achieved a complete victory. Comrades in both the women's and men's teams played to their level, demonstrating the unique style of China's badminton movement: "fast, ruthless, accurate, and agile." I also did my best in the competition. We all deeply realized that this victory was first and foremost a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a result of highlighting politics. Personally, if I had not studied Chairman Mao's works before going abroad to improve my ideological awareness and establish lofty ambitions, the collective would have suffered losses in the international competition due to my incorrect personal thoughts. In the match against the Danish team, the situation of us falling behind first, then catching up, and finally winning occurred many times. This was the result of our repeated study of Chairman Mao's teachings, not being arrogant when we had the advantage, not being discouraged when we were at a disadvantage, and daring to advance in the face of difficulties.
    After returning home from Northern Europe, the praise given to us by the people of the motherland is actually a higher demand for us and an encouragement to us. This year is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, and all walks of life are making contributions to building our country into a stronger socialist nation. As an ordinary soldier on the sports front, in order to keep up with the development of the situation, I must first study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, strive to improve my ideological awareness, and drive technology with politics; at the same time, I must also learn the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and Dazhai, diligently practice hard skills, and strive to report to the Party and the people with ideal results in this year's competitions.

### 昂首阔步迎新春

    昂首阔步迎新春
    在迎接新春的时候，同志们都从祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业所取得的成就中得到鼓舞。作为一个运动员，每当我想起祖国的伟大成就，再看看自己，虽然在体育事业上作了一定的努力，但我的进步与党和人民对我的要求，还有很大差距。
    在党的阳光照耀和雨露浇沐下，我被培养成为一个具有一定思想与技术水平的运动员。通过多次的国内、国际比赛，我越来越深刻地体会到：作为一个新中国的青年，要想在社会主义事业上有所作为，要想成为一个有益于人民的人，必须用毛泽东思想武装自己。
    我们羽毛球队初到北欧时，我产生了一些个人杂念，学习了毛主席著作，树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的信心，增强了政治责任感。我想到，这些年来，组织上帮助我提高了思想觉悟，同志们热情无私地教我掌握技术，提高水平，组织上寄予我很大期望，希望我能做个对人民有贡献的运动员。看看出国比赛的运动服上印着“中国”两字，我就更感到责任的重大。我应在场上表现出中国人民的精神面貌。即使我不能从分数上取胜，也要使对方运动员和观众看到中国运动员顽强的战斗作风和高尚风格。何况，我相信在党的培养下成长的我，是敢打敢拼的。
    在出国前的准备期间，我思想上的提高、政治上的收获是主要的。技术上的巩固和提高只占第二位。到达哥本哈根以后，我们全体队员还作了“什么是毛泽东时代青年的理想”的专题讨论。我们羽毛球队同丹麦队、瑞典队一共比赛了三十四盘，获得了全胜。女队和男队的同志，都打出了水平，表现出我国羽毛球运动“快、狠、准、活”的独特风格。我也在比赛中尽了自己的努力。我们都深深体会到，这次胜利首先是毛泽东思想的胜利，是突出政治的结果。以我个人来说，如果不是在出国以前学习毛主席著作提高思想觉悟，树立雄心壮志，那就会因个人思想不对头而使集体在国际比赛中受到损失。在与丹麦队的比赛中，我们先落后，再追上去，直至取胜的局面，曾多次出现。这是我们反复地学习了毛主席的教导，有利时不骄傲，不利时不气馁，敢于知难而进的结果。
    从北欧回国后，祖国人民给予我们的赞誉，这实际是对我们提出更高的要求，是对我们的鞭策。今年是第三个五年计划的头一年，各行各业都为把我国建设成一个更加强大的社会主义国家而作出贡献。作为体育战线上的普通一兵，为了能跟上形势的发展，首先必须活学活用毛主席著作，努力提高思想觉悟，以政治带动技术；同时也要学习大庆和大寨的革命精神，苦练过硬本领，争取在今年的比赛中以理想的成绩向党和人民汇报。
