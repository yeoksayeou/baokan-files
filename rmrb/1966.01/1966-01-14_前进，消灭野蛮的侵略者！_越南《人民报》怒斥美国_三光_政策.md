    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th. The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published an editorial on the 12th entitled "Advance, Eliminate the Savage Aggressors!", condemning the most barbaric crimes committed by the US imperialists in South Vietnam recently while launching a noisy "peace offensive."
    The editorial said that while launching the so-called "seeking peace" campaign, the US ruling clique brazenly intensified and expanded the war of aggression against South Vietnam with unprecedentedly barbaric war methods.
    The editorial said, what have the US ruling circles done since December 20?
    First, they have continuously transported a large number of US troops and war materials into South Vietnam. On December 29 last year, the 3rd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division of the United States, 4,000 men, arrived in Pleiku. Two days later, about 20 F-4C fighter-reconnaissance planes were transported to South Vietnam.
    Second, senior Pentagon officers and other senior officials of the Johnson administration successively came to South Vietnam to study steps to strengthen and expand the war of aggression.
    Third, large-scale "sweeps" have been continuously carried out in some areas of South Vietnam, and airplanes, artillery, napalm bombs and phosphorus incendiary bombs, chemical poisons, poisonous gas, and other barbaric war methods have been used on a large scale to slaughter the people of South Vietnam.
    The editorial listed the atrocities committed by the US aggressors in the past two weeks, including the artillery bombardment of Xinjiang Village by the South Korean puppet army on December 22, which killed 50 civilians during a "sweep" of the area; on December 28, US planes dropped chemical poisons in Can Tho Province, poisoning 4,000 people and destroying crops on more than 10,000 hectares of land; from December 31 to January 7, US, Australian, New Zealand, and South Korean troops and Saigon puppet troops carried out several large "sweeps" in some villages in Duc Hoa and Duc Hue counties in Xin'an-Di'an (near Saigon). During the large "sweeps," military aircraft spread chemical poisons and dropped poison gas bombs in large areas. All the houses in the areas passed through by the sweeping forces were burned, crops were destroyed, hundreds of people were killed, and thousands were driven into concentration camps; on January 2, 3, and 6, US aggressors shelled and bombed the Bien Hoa area of ​​Thu Dau Mot Province, killing many residents and destroying dozens of shops and houses; on January 8, US planes strafed the "Thuan Phong" passenger ship sailing from Thu Dau Mot to Dau Tieng, killing more than 200 passengers; since January 9, 8,000 US, Australian, and New Zealand troops have been conducting a large-scale "sweep" in an area 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon in Di'an. The area has also been subjected to fierce bombing by B-52 jet aircraft and shelling by heavy artillery units. They released poisonous gas into the shelters of peaceful residents.
    The editorial said that the above-mentioned crimes committed by the US aggressors show that while the US ruling clique is clamoring and arrogantly talking about "peace," they are expanding the war on a large scale by the most barbaric means.
    The editorial said that as pointed out in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 11: "US President Johnson's hypocritical arguments and fraudulent means of 'peace efforts' cannot conceal the extremely brutal true face of the US aggressors."
    The editorial called on the people of all countries to severely condemn the US aggressors, carry out a more powerful struggle to stop the evil claws of the US aggressors, and expose their false "peace" conspiracy.
    The editorial emphasized that war criminals will be punished as they deserve.
    The editorial said: "The US aggressors are taking barbaric war actions in an attempt to save their defeat and get out of trouble. But they are completely wrong. Their crimes will only deepen the hatred of our people and further strengthen our determination to annihilate the enemy."

    前进，消灭野蛮的侵略者！
    越南《人民报》怒斥美国“三光”政策
    新华社河内十二日电　越南《人民报》十二日以《前进，消灭野蛮的侵略者》为题发表社论，谴责美帝国主义者近来在发动喧闹的“和平攻势”的同时，在越南南方犯下的最野蛮的罪行。
    社论说，美国统治集团在展开所谓“谋求和平”的运动的同时，悍然以空前野蛮的战争手段加紧和扩大侵略越南南方的战争。
    社论说，从十二月二十日以来，美国统治集团干了些什么呢？
    第一，他们不断把美国军队和战争手段大量运进越南南方。去年十二月二十九日，美国第二十五步兵师第三旅四千人开到波来古。过了两天，又把约二十架F—4C型战斗侦察机运到越南南方。
    第二，五角大楼的高级军官和约翰逊政府的其他高级官员相继来到越南南方，研究强化和扩大侵略战争的步骤。
    第三，不断地在越南南方一些地区进行大规模“扫荡”，大规模使用飞机、大炮、凝固汽油弹和磷燃烧弹、化学毒药、毒气和其他野蛮战争手段来屠杀越南南方人民。
    社论列举了美国侵略者在过去两星期中所犯的暴行，其中包括十二月二十二日，南朝鲜仆从军开炮滥轰新江村，对这个地区进行了“扫荡”，打死五十名平民；十二月二十八日，美国飞机在芹苴省撒放化学毒药，有四千人中毒，一万多公顷土地上的庄稼被毁坏；十二月三十一日到一月七日，美国、澳大利亚、新西兰、南朝鲜的军队和西贡伪军对新安—堤岸（西贡附近）的德和县和德惠县一些乡村进行了几次大“扫荡”，在大“扫荡”中，军用飞机撒放化学毒药，在广大地区扔毒气弹。扫荡部队所经地区的全部房屋都被烧光，庄稼被毁，几百人被打死，数以千计的人被赶进集中营；一月二日、三日和六日，美国侵略者对土龙木省边蓄地区开炮和轰炸，炸死许多居民，炸毁几十家商店和住房；一月八日，美国飞机扫射从土龙木驶向油汀的“顺丰”客轮，打死乘客两百多人；一月九日以来，八千名美军、澳大利亚军和新西兰军一直在西贡西北三十公里的堤岸一个地区进行大规模“扫荡”。这一地区还遭到B—52型喷气式飞机的猛烈轰炸和重炮部队的轰击。他们向和平居民的掩蔽所施放了毒气。
    社论说，美国侵略者所犯的上述罪行表明，在美国统治集团吵吵嚷嚷、狂妄地谈论“和平”的时候，他们正在以最野蛮的手段大规模地扩大战争。
    社论说，正如越南民主共和国外交部一月十一日的声明中所指出的：“美国总统约翰逊的假仁假义论调和‘和平努力’的欺诈手段，掩盖不了美国侵略者极其残暴的真面目。”
    社论呼吁一切国家的人民严厉谴责美国侵略者，进行更强有力的斗争，制止美国侵略者的罪恶的魔掌，揭露他们的假“和平”阴谋。
    社论强调说，战争罪犯定将受到应得的惩罚。
    社论说：“美国侵略者正在采取野蛮的战争行动，企图挽救他们的失败和摆脱困境。但是他们大错特错了。他们的罪行只会加深我们全国人民的仇恨，进一步加强我们歼灭敌人的决心。”
