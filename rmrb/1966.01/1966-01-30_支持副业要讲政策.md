    Supporting Sideline Occupations Requires Policy Guidance
    The People's Banks in the Hainan Island area have recently been actively supporting rural communes and production teams in developing sideline production. This is a welcome phenomenon. However, the practices of some units do not conform to policy.
    Some members of the Fourteenth Production Team of the Saiyu Brigade of the Xinwu Commune in Chengmai County know how to make volleyballs. Local banks and credit cooperatives have provided many loans to support this team in purchasing cowhide everywhere to engage in the collective sideline occupation of making volleyballs. The production team has good income and can repay the loans on time. However, cowhide is a nationally managed material, and the production team's random purchases everywhere are not conducive to national production and construction. After learning about this situation, the Guangdong Provincial Livestock Company has suggested that relevant parties correct this.

    支持副业要讲政策
    海南岛地区的人民银行，近来都在积极支持农村社队发展副业生产。这是一个可喜的现象。但是有个别单位作法不符合政策。
    澄迈县的新吴公社赛玉大队第十四生产队有些社员会制做排球。当地银行和信用社便贷了不少款，支持这个队到处去收购牛皮革，搞制排球的集体副业。生产队收入很好，贷款也能按时归还。但是，牛皮革是国家管理的物资，生产队随便到处收购，不利于国家的生产建设。广东省畜产公司了解到这个情况后，已建议有关方面纠正。
