    My Foreign Ministry Sends Note to Indian Embassy in China
    Strongly Protesting the Indian Government's Long-Term Detention and Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    Reaffirming Demand that the Indian Government Immediately Release the Suffering Overseas Chinese and Cease All Discrimination and Persecution
    Xinhua News Agency, January 24th. The Chinese Foreign Ministry delivered a note to the Indian Embassy in China on the 12th, strongly protesting the Indian government's long-term detention and maltreatment of a large number of peaceful and law-abiding overseas Chinese residing in India, demanding that the Indian government cease discrimination and persecution of overseas Chinese.
    The note stated: "Since October 1962, the Indian government has arrested a large number of innocent overseas Chinese and imprisoned them in concentration camps and prisons across the country, while also subjecting other overseas Chinese to various forms of persecution. The Chinese government has repeatedly demanded that the Indian government release these refugees and cease all persecution activities against overseas Chinese. However, the Indian government has consistently denied and attempted to evade its responsibility."
    The note stated: "In August 1963, the Indian government unreasonably rejected the Chinese government's legitimate request to continue sending ships to pick up the suffering overseas Chinese. After the Chinese government sternly refuted this and repeatedly demanded that the Indian government release all detained overseas Chinese, the Indian government, feeling guilty and lacking justification, sent notes on September 4, 1963, and January 8, 1964, making perfunctory excuses, claiming that it was 'taking necessary steps for the welfare and resettlement' of the detained refugees, and that the refugees 'were being released and having their lives rearranged.' However, the facts of the past two years and more have shown that this statement by the Indian government is completely hypocritical.
    "Currently, hundreds of innocent overseas Chinese are still being detained in Indian concentration camps and prisons across the country. Their personal freedom has been deprived for a long time, they are subjected to various inhumane maltreatment and persecution in concentration camps and prisons, and their property is even being managed as 'enemy property.' Not only that, but in recent years the Indian government has also continuously ordered peaceful and law-abiding overseas Chinese residing in India to leave the country within a certain time limit, and has subjected them to all kinds of discrimination and persecution. All of this fully exposes that the Indian government, for the needs of its domestic and foreign policies, is deliberately continuing to pursue its anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, and is worsening Sino-Indian relations."
    The note pointed out: "The Indian government has been using such unscrupulous means to detain and maltreat a large number of peaceful and law-abiding Chinese nationals for more than three years. This crime of rudely trampling on the norms of international law is rare in the history of international relations. The Chinese government hereby lodges a strong protest with the Indian government and reiterates the following demands to the Indian government:
    "1. Immediately release all the suffering overseas Chinese detained in concentration camps and prisons across the country, return their property, and compensate them for their losses.
    "2. Immediately cease all discrimination and persecution against overseas Chinese residing in India, and effectively guarantee their personal freedom and the safety of their lives and property."
    The note stated: "The Chinese government demands that the Indian government make a clear response quickly."

    我外交部照会印度驻华大使馆
    强烈抗议印政府长期关押和迫害华侨
    再次要求印度政府必须立即释放受难华侨并停止一切歧视和迫害
    新华社二十四日讯　中国外交部十二日把一件照会交给印度驻华大使馆，强烈抗议印度政府长期关押和虐待大批和平守法的旅印华侨，要求印度政府停止歧视和迫害华侨。
    照会说：“自一九六二年十月以来，印度政府逮捕了大批无辜华侨，把他们关进集中营和各地监狱，同时还对其他华侨进行了各种迫害。中国政府曾多次要求印度政府释放这些难侨，并停止对华侨的一切迫害活动。但是，印度政府一贯进行抵赖，妄图推卸罪责。”
    照会说：“一九六三年八月，印度政府无理拒绝了中国政府关于继续派船接运受难华侨的正当要求。经中国政府严词驳斥并一再要求印度政府释放全部被关押的华侨之后，印度政府理亏心虚，在一九六三年九月四日和一九六四年一月八日来照敷衍搪塞，说什么正在为被关押难侨的‘福利和重新安置采取必要的步骤’，难侨‘正在被释放和重新安排生活’。但是，两年多来的事实表明，印度政府的这种说法是完全虚伪的。
    “目前，在印度集中营和各地监狱里仍然关押着几百名无辜的华侨。他们的人身自由长期被剥夺，他们在集中营和监狱中遭受着各种惨无人道的虐待和迫害，他们的财产还竟然被当作‘敌产’管理。不仅如此，近年来印度政府还不断地勒令和平守法的旅印华侨限期离境，并对他们进行种种歧视和迫害，这一切都充分暴露了印度政府为了内政、外交的需要，蓄意继续推行它的反华、排华政策，恶化中印两国关系。”
    照会指出：“印度政府如此不择手段地关押和虐待大批和平守法的中国侨民，迄今已三年有余。这种粗暴地践踏国际法准则的罪行，在国际关系史上是罕见的。中国政府就此向印度政府提出强烈的抗议，并对印度政府重申以下要求：
    “一、立即释放被关押在集中营和各地监狱里的全部受难华侨，归还他们的财产，并赔偿他们的损失。
    “二、立即停止对旅印华侨的一切歧视和迫害，切实保障他们的人身自由和生命财产的安全。”
    照会说：“中国政府要求印度政府迅速作出明确的答复。”
