    According to Western news agency reports, diplomatic observers believe that Mansfield's "gloomy report" on the Vietnam issue has "caused a shock to the entire United States that exceeded anything previously experienced," while also causing an "embarrassing state" within the U.S. State Department.
    And according to the *New York Times*, the report that Mansfield personally presented to Johnson was even "gloomier" than the one that was publicly released. Therefore, it is entirely conceivable that if the undisclosed gloom were to be made public, then the shock would obviously be even greater, and the U.S. State Department would be more than just "embarrassed."

    The U.S. invading forces are boasting about conducting an unprecedented "sweep" on the edge of the "Iron Triangle." However, they have consistently come up empty, "able to see the Viet Cong but unable to catch them." It turns out that there is a network of tunnels stretching for dozens of miles, allowing the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces to appear and disappear unpredictably, while the pampered soldiers can only look on helplessly, at a complete loss.
    The Associated Press cannot help but lament that for the U.S. military to destroy the tunnel network, "it would take enough explosives to blow up Mont Blanc (the highest peak in the Alps)." But, it also says, "This is precisely what this vast U.S. force is determined to do." What big talk! The U.S. aggressors, mired in the mire, are still boasting that they can swallow Mont Blanc!

    British newspapers have revealed that the British government plans to send a "symbolic force" to Southern Rhodesia to "suppress" the "rebellion" led by Smith.
    Sending a "symbolic force" to conduct a "symbolic" suppression is a symbol of the neo-colonialist approach taken by the Wilson government on the Southern Rhodesia issue.

    三言两语
    据西方通讯社报道，外交观察家认为，曼斯菲尔德发表的关于越南问题的“阴暗的报告”，给美国全国“造成了一种超过以前所经历过的一切东西的震动”，同时在美国国务院中引起了“尴尬状态”。
    而据《纽约时报》说，曼斯菲尔德亲自向约翰逊提出的报告比公开发表的还要“更阴暗”。因此，完全可以设想，如果把未公开的阴暗面公开出来，那末震动显然更要厉害，美国国务院也不仅仅是“尴尬”而已。

    美国侵略军大吹大擂他们正在“铁三角”边缘进行一次空前规模的“扫荡”。但是，他们一直扑空，“可以看到越共，但抓不住他们”。原来，这里有绵延几十英里的地道网，南越人民武装能神出鬼没地忽隐忽现，而少爷兵却可望不可即，一筹莫展。
    美联社不禁哀叹说，美军要毁掉地道网，“得要有足够炸毁勃朗峰（阿尔卑斯山最高峰）的炸药。”但是，它又说，“这正是这支庞大的美国部队决心要做的事情”。好大的口气！陷在泥潭中的美国侵略者，却还夸口它能吞掉勃朗峰哩！

    英国报纸透露，英国政府打算派遣“象征性部队”去南罗得西亚“镇压”史密斯领导的“叛乱”。
    派出“象征性部队”，去进行“象征性”镇压，这是威尔逊政府在南罗得西亚问题上采取新殖民主义手法的一个象征。
