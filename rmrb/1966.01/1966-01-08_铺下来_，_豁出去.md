    “Throw Yourself In”, “Go All Out”
    Beijing Knitting General Factory  Wang Ruyao
    Good Quartermaster Sun Leyi once said: "You must throw yourself in and work alongside the soldiers!" Liberation Army soldiers often make bold statements like: "Crawling and rolling in the mud and water, we'll develop superb skills to kill the enemy"; worker comrades also love to say heroic words such as: "Even if we have to crawl and climb, we must complete the task!"
    This heroic ambition of placing the individual aside and daring to fight and charge for the revolution is precisely the spirit we need most to carry out the revolution.
    To "throw yourself in," you must first "go all out." If you can't bear to get covered in mud and water, soaked in sweat, how can you "crawl and roll"? Lei Feng escorted an old woman on a rainy night, covering a sick child with his raincoat; what he "went all out" on was a sleepless night and a body soaked in rain; Wang Jie "went all out" with his own life for the safety of his class brothers.
    To learn from heroes is, in the final analysis, to learn the spirit of thorough revolution, continuous revolution, and daring to fight to the death with the largest and last exploiting class in human history – imperialism; to learn the spirit of daring to wage war against the old world and the old system, to wage war against nature, to dare to change the world and create a new world of happiness for the people with our own hands! Enemies will not fall if you don't strike them down, bells will not ring if you don't hit them, there is no victory without sacrifice, and no harvest without sweat. If you don't fight with the enemy, they will come looking for you; if you don't kill them, they will not let you live. The same is true for daily work; if you don't "throw yourself in" to solve problems and overcome difficulties, problems and difficulties will "pounce" on you; if you don't "go all out" and fight them, they will come knocking on your door!
      "Fighting with the heavens is endless joy! Fighting with the earth is endless joy! Fighting with people is endless joy!" Struggle is the law. A revolutionary should be like the heroes, consciously and actively fighting with the heavens, the earth, and people, "throwing yourself in, going all out," to strive for the victory of the revolution.

### “铺下来”，“豁出去”

    “铺下来”，“豁出去”
    北京针织总厂　王瑞尧
    好司务长孙乐义说过这样的话：“要铺下身子和战士们一起干！”解放军战士常有这样的豪言：“泥里水里摸爬滚打，练出过硬杀敌本领”；工人同志们也爱说这样的壮语：“滚着爬着也得完成任务！”
    这种置个人于度外，为革命敢拼敢闯的豪情壮志，正是我们干革命最需要的精神气魄。
    要“铺下来”，首先就得“豁出去”。舍不得一身泥水、一身热汗，如何能“摸爬滚打”？雷锋在大雨之夜护送老大娘，把雨衣遮着病儿，他“豁出”的是一夜不眠，一身雨水；王杰为了阶级弟兄的安全，他“豁出”了自己的生命。
    学英雄，归根到底是学个彻底革命，不断革命，敢于和人类史上最大也是最后的剥削阶级——帝国主义拼个死活的精神；学个敢于向旧世界旧制度开战，向大自然开战，敢于改天换地，双手创出一个幸福的人民的新天下的精神！敌人不打不倒，钟不敲不响，没有牺牲便没有胜利，不洒汗水便没有收成。你不与敌人拼，他要来找你；你不把他弄死，他就要叫你活不成。日常工作也是如此，你不“铺下来”去解决问题克服困难，问题、困难就会向你“扑过来”；你不“豁出去”，与它战斗，它就会找上头来！
      “与天奋斗，其乐无穷！与地奋斗，其乐无穷！与人奋斗，其乐无穷！”斗争是规律。一个革命者要象英雄们那样，自觉地主动地与天与地与人奋斗，“铺下来，豁出去”，争取革命的胜利。
