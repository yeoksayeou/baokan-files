    Warm Congratulations to the Cuban People
    Today is the seventh anniversary of the victory of the Cuban Revolution. The Chinese people extend warm festival greetings and revolutionary salute to the fraternal Cuban people from afar.
    Seven years ago, the heroic Cuban people, after a difficult armed struggle, finally overthrew the Batista regime, the most reactionary and brutal dictatorial regime in Cuban history, which was fostered single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, and achieved the victory of the revolution.
    The victory of the Cuban Revolution once again proves to all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world that as long as the people of all countries take up arms and persist in armed struggle, the counter-revolutionary armed forces of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs can be completely defeated; any fascist and brutal reactionary rule supported by U.S. imperialism can also be completely destroyed. This is true in Cuba, and it is also true in other parts of the world.
    Today, the revolutionary situation in the entire Latin America is excellent. The struggles of the peoples of various countries against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are rising one after another, continuously. Currently, in more than half of the twenty countries in Latin America, there are anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship armed struggles. Since April of last year, the heroic Dominican people, in defiance of the brutal suppression by the U.S. invading forces, have persisted in the anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggle, setting off a new anti-U.S. surge in the Caribbean. The development of the revolutionary situation in Latin America proves the truth pointed out in the Second Declaration of Havana in 1962. The document states that "in those countries where the control of U.S. monopolies is more rampant, the exploitation by the oligarchy is more cruel, and the situation of workers and peasants is more unbearable," "the democratic path is inevitably completely blocked," and the cruel nature of dictatorial and reactionary rule is even more exposed, which "inevitably leads to the outbreak of people's revolution." The anti-U.S. anger of the Latin American people cannot be quelled by U.S. imperialism. The neo-colonialist rule established by U.S. imperialism in Latin America is becoming increasingly unstable.
    Of course, U.S. imperialism will never automatically withdraw from Latin America. For seven years, U.S. imperialism has continuously carried out military provocations, political subversion, and economic blockades against the newborn Cuba, and has constantly antagonized the Cuban people. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also plotting reactionary coups and carrying out bloody suppression in Latin America, intensifying its control, intervention, and plunder of Latin American countries. The year before last, U.S. imperialism manufactured the reactionary military coup in Brazil. Last year, U.S. imperialism brazenly sent tens of thousands of U.S. invading troops to suppress the revolutionary struggle of the Dominican people, and tried every possible means to plot the conspiracy to establish a so-called "Permanent Inter-American Force" to further control Latin American countries and strangle the national democratic revolution in Latin America. The notorious "Johnson Doctrine," which aims at suppressing the Latin American revolution, also emerged. The U.S. House of Representatives even openly passed a resolution on armed intervention in Latin American countries. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the peoples of all Latin American countries.
    The Chinese people and the Cuban people, the Chinese people and the peoples of all Latin American countries, have forged a deep fighting friendship in the long-term struggle against U.S. imperialism. We wish the friendship between the Chinese people and the Cuban people, the Chinese people and the peoples of all Latin American countries, will grow stronger day by day, wish the Cuban people new achievements on the road of revolution, and also wish the Latin American people new and brilliant victories in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in the new year.

### 向古巴人民致以热烈的祝贺

    向古巴人民致以热烈的祝贺
    今天是古巴革命胜利的七周年纪念日。中国人民向兄弟的古巴人民遥致节日的祝贺，并致以革命的敬礼。
    七年以前，英勇的古巴人民经过艰巨的武装斗争，终于推翻了美帝国主义一手扶植的、古巴历史上最反动、最残暴的独裁政权巴蒂斯塔政权，取得了革命的胜利。
    古巴革命的胜利，再一次向全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族证明，各国人民只要拿起武器，坚持武装斗争，美帝国主义及其走狗的反革命武装力量，是完全可以打败的；美帝国主义所支持的任何法西斯残暴的反动统治，也是完全可以摧毁的。这在古巴是如此，在世界的其他地区也是如此。
    今天，整个拉丁美洲的革命形势很好，各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，此伏彼起，绵延不断。目前，在拉丁美洲二十个国家中，已有半数以上的国家，存在着反美、反独裁的武装斗争。去年四月以来，英勇的多米尼加人民不顾美国侵略军的残暴镇压，一直坚持着反美反独裁斗争，掀起了加勒比海的新的反美怒涛。拉丁美洲革命形势的发展，证明了一九六二年第二个“哈瓦那宣言”所指出的真理。这个文件写道：“在美国垄断控制越厉害、寡头势力的剥削越残忍、工农群众的处境越不能忍受的那些国家里”，“民主的道路必然被完全堵塞”，独裁反动统治的残酷本性更加暴露无遗，这“就不可避免地要爆发人民的革命”。拉丁美洲人民的反美怒火，是美帝国主义所平息不了的。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲所建立的新殖民主义统治已经越来越不稳定了。
    当然，美帝国主义是绝不会自动地退出拉丁美洲的。七年以来，美帝国主义对新生的古巴不断地进行军事挑衅、政治颠覆和经济封锁，不断地敌视古巴人民。同时，美帝国主义又在拉丁美洲策划反动政变，进行血腥镇压，对拉丁美洲国家加紧控制、干涉和掠夺。前年，美帝国主义制造了巴西的反动军事政变。去年，美帝国主义又悍然出动几万美国侵略军镇压多米尼加人民的革命斗争，并且千方百计地策划建立所谓“泛美常设部队”的阴谋，来进一步控制拉丁美洲国家和扼杀拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动。以镇压拉丁美洲革命为内容的臭名昭彰的“约翰逊主义”也出笼了。美国众议院甚至公开通过了武装干涉拉丁美洲国家的决议。这一切都表明，美帝国主义是拉丁美洲各国人民的不共戴天的死敌。
    中国人民和古巴人民，中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民，在反对美帝国主义的长期斗争中，结成了深厚的战斗友谊。我们愿祝中国人民和古巴人民，中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民的友谊日益增长，祝古巴人民在革命的道路上取得新的成就，并且也预祝拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，在新的一年里取得新的光辉的胜利。
