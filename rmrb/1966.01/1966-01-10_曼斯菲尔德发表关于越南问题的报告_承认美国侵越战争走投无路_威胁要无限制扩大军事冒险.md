    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: Mansfield, the U.S. Senate Democratic leader, who recently returned from a visit to thirteen Asian and European countries or regions at the end of the year, published a pessimistic and bleak report on the 8th, expressing serious concern over the severe failures and isolated, bleak prospects of the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. The report shows that the U.S. government is trying to expand the war to the entire Southeast Asia and even the Asian continent under the smoke screen of "peace talks" in order to save its defeat. However, the report admits that the U.S.'s adventurous actions to further expand the war will cause the U.S. to face "huge" dangers and difficulties.
    This report on the Vietnam issue was submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright by Mansfield and four other U.S. senators after visiting thirteen countries or regions in Europe and Asia (including South Vietnam) from November 13 to December 28.
    The report admits that despite Johnson's massive increase in troops in South Vietnam and the gradual "escalation" of the war, it "has not been able to repel the Viet Cong offensive." The report said that the South Vietnam Liberation Army "has further strengthened their forces" and "generally intensified military activities." The report said that in the first few months of last year, "their control has expanded to large areas of this country (referring to South Vietnam), especially some provinces near the western border. Transportation and telecommunications between populated areas are increasingly in a dangerous state." The report pointed out that although the Johnson government increased its troops to South Vietnam many times last year, the number of U.S. casualties is also increasing as the intensity of the war increases. In some military bases occupied by the United States, "the Viet Cong can still bypass the defenders and infiltrate the area from time to time to carry out hit-and-run attacks. Transportation between coastal base areas is still subject to Viet Cong ambushes and attacks. In Saigon, despite tight security, the sound of automatic weapons or mortar shells exploding around Saigon day and night is no longer an unusual sound. The Viet Cong's ability to carry out terrorist attacks in Saigon is often very obvious."
    The report worriedly said that, in short, "Given the Viet Cong's increased efforts, it is doubtful whether the limited position that the Saigon government (referring to the puppet regime) currently holds in Vietnam can continue to be maintained indefinitely, let alone expanded." The report said that the situation of the "Saigon government" is far behind that of when Ngo Dinh Diem was killed, and there is no basis to expect it to "take on a much larger burden than it currently takes on." The report anxiously said, "Indeed, if the current trend continues, there is no way to be sure how much the U.S. military obligations will eventually need to increase before the end of the conflict."
    The report pointed out that not only has the Johnson government failed to save the defeat, but its situation is also becoming increasingly isolated. The report said that Asian countries "generally view the conflict in Vietnam with extreme unease. As the war is expanding and becoming increasingly intense, those countries closest to Vietnam see a greater danger of the war expanding into their territory. They feel that the longer the conflict drags on and the faster it escalates, the greater the danger to them." Those Asian countries that are geographically farther away from the war in South Vietnam also "realize the danger that the increasingly protracted and increasingly tense situation in South Vietnam brings to the entire region." In addition, "Every country in Asia has its own domestic problems... Every country is primarily concerned with avoiding direct involvement in the Vietnam conflict. In terms of providing military assistance to South Vietnam, it is unlikely that substantial material assistance will be obtained from these countries, with the exception of Korea (referring to the South Korean puppet regime). Other countries are either unwilling or unwilling to get involved in a military sense, or are unable to do so because of internal difficulties or because of the broader strategic needs caused by the Asian situation." The report also pointed out that even in South Korea, withdrawing troops to South Vietnam would obviously weaken the U.S. military power there and thus "create new problems."
    The report clamored that, under these circumstances, the United States is facing a "difficult and painful choice."
    The report expressed support for the "peace talks" scam played by the Johnson government in order to deceive world public opinion and cover up its conspiracy to expand the war. Mansfield told reporters after meeting with Johnson on the 7th that he believed that Johnson's recent "peace offensive" was "worthwhile, and I expect it will continue," "I do not expect bombing to resume soon." His report also showed that the United States is playing the "peace talks" trick just to buy time so that the United States can stabilize its position and continue to occupy South Vietnam. The report said, "Negotiations at the present time, if negotiations do take place, and if a ceasefire and standstill are achieved at the same time as the negotiations, will also help to stabilize a situation in which most residents nominally remain under the control of the (Saigon) government (i.e., the United States), but control of the countryside is mainly in the hands of the Viet Cong." The report said that this situation is "not a very satisfactory prospect either."
    The report further blatantly revealed the United States' intention to expand the war to the entire Southeast Asia, China, and other countries in Asia. It said, "Another prospect that can be seen is the unlimited expansion and intensification of the war." "At least the entire Southeast Asian continent has the potential to become a battlefield. As has already been pointed out, the war has intriguingly expanded to Laos and has begun to impact the Cambodian border, and pressure in northeastern Thailand is also increasing," "This conflict will continue in the direction of a major war on the Asian continent."
    But the report admits that the U.S.'s reckless military adventure in Asia is "enormously dangerous." The report said that if it does so, the United States is not "adding pressure to a bounded military situation, but applying pressure to a virtually endless military situation," the result of which is "a continuous increase in U.S. troops. And the end of this road is equally unpredictable." The report worriedly said, "The danger is enormous, not only because of the military realities in the situation, but also because no other country besides the United States has provided assistance to the South Vietnamese war effort, and it does not appear that other countries will provide assistance, with only a few exceptions. On the contrary, as things stand, the longer the war continues in its current pattern, the more its scope expands, the greater the pressure on the relationship between the United States and its allies in the Far East and Europe."

### 曼斯菲尔德发表关于越南问题的报告  承认美国侵越战争走投无路  威胁要无限制扩大军事冒险

    曼斯菲尔德发表关于越南问题的报告
    承认美国侵越战争走投无路  威胁要无限制扩大军事冒险
    新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：岁暮寒冬接连走访了十三个亚洲和欧洲国家或地区刚刚回国的美国参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德八日发表了一个悲观、凄凉的报告，对美国侵越战争遭到惨重失败，处境孤立，前途渺茫表示严重不安。报告表明美国政府正在“和谈”的烟幕下力图把战争扩大到整个东南亚以至亚洲大陆来挽救败局。但是报告承认，美国进一步扩大战争的冒险行径将使美国面临“巨大”的危险和困难。
    这个关于越南问题的报告是曼斯菲尔德和其他四个美国参议员从十一月十三日到十二月二十八日访问了欧洲和亚洲十三个国家或地区（包括南越）后向参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特提出的。
    报告承认，尽管约翰逊大举增兵南越和把战争逐步“升级”，但是“并未能击退越共的攻势”。报告说，南越解放军“已进一步加强了他们的部队”，并“普遍加剧军事活动”。报告说，在去年头几个月，“他们的控制权已扩展到这个国家（指越南南方）的大块地区、特别是靠近西部边境的一些省份。在人口集中地之间的交通运输和电讯联系越来越处于危险状态”。报告指出，尽管约翰逊政府去年多次增兵南越，但是随着战争的激烈程度在增加，美军的伤亡数字也在增加。在美国占据的一些军事基地，“越共仍然可以绕过守军渗入地区不时进行打了就跑的袭击。沿海的基地地区之间的交通仍然遭到越共的伏击和攻击。在西贡，尽管守卫很严，但是不论白天黑夜，西贡周围的自动武器或者迫击炮弹的爆破声已不是不寻常的响声。越共在西贡市内进行恐怖袭击的能力也常常是十分明显的”。
    报告不安地说，总之，“鉴于越共加强努力，西贡政府（指傀儡政权）现在在越南保持的有限地位能否继续无限期地保持下去，更不用说是扩大了，是值得怀疑的”。报告说，“西贡政府”的境况比吴庭艳被杀害时还要落后很多，没有根据可以期望它“挑起比它目前所挑的大得多的担子”。报告焦急地说，“的确，如果目前的趋势继续下去，就无法肯定地说在冲突结束以前美国的军事义务最后需要增加多少。”
    报告指出，约翰逊政府不但没有能够挽救败局，它的处境也越来越孤立。报告说，亚洲国家“总的说来都以极为不安的心情看待越南这场冲突。由于这场战争正在扩大和越来越加紧，那些最靠近越南的国家看到了战争有扩大到它们领土的更大的危险。他们感到，这场冲突拖得越久、升级得越快，对他们的危险也就越大。”在地理上离南越战争较远的那些亚洲国家也“意识到南越境内的斗争越来越旷日持久和越来越紧张的情况对整个地区带来的危险。”此外，“亚洲的每一个国家都有自己的国内问题……每一个国家主要关心的都是避免直接卷入越南冲突。在为南越提供军事援助方面，不大可能从这些国家得到实质性的物质帮助，只有朝鲜（指南朝鲜傀儡政权）是例外。别的国家，有的是不愿意或者不大愿意在军事意义上卷入，有的是没有能力这样做，因为内部有困难，或者因为亚洲形势所造成的更广泛的战略需要。”报告还指出，即使在南朝鲜，抽调部队去南越，显然将削弱美国在那里的军事力量因而“造成新问题”。
    报告叫嚷说，在这种情况下，美国正面临一个“困难而痛苦的选择”。
    报告表示支持约翰逊政府为了欺骗世界舆论，掩盖它扩大战争的阴谋而玩弄的“和谈”大骗局。曼斯菲尔德七日同约翰逊举行会谈后对记者说，他认为约翰逊最近发动的“和平攻势”是“值得的，而且我预料它将继续下去”，“我并不预料不久就会恢复轰炸”。他的报告还表明，美国所以大耍“和谈”花招，不过是企图争取喘息时间，使得美国能稳住阵脚，继续霸占南越。报告说，“在目前进行谈判，如果的确进行谈判的话，如果在谈判的同时实现停火和原地不动的话，那也将有助于稳定这样一种局势：大多数居民在名义上仍然在
  （西贡）政府（即美国）控制之下，但是农村的控制权主要在越共手中”。报告说，这种情况“也不是一种非常令人满意的前景”。
    报告进一步露骨地表明了美国要把战火扩大到整个东南亚、中国和亚洲其他国家的用心。它说，“可以看到的另一种前景是战争无限制的扩大和加剧”。“至少整个东南亚大陆有成为潜在的战场的可能性。正如已经指出的，战争已经耐人寻味地扩大到老挝，并开始冲击到柬埔寨边界，而泰国东北部的压力也在增加”，“这场冲突将朝着在亚洲大陆发生大战的方向继续下去。”
    但是报告承认，美国在亚洲进行疯狂的军事冒险，“危险是巨大的”。报告说，如果这样做，美国就不是“向一种有界限的军事局势增加压力，而是向一种实际上无止境的军事局势施加压力”，其结果是“持续地增加美国部队。而这条道路的尽头同样无法预见”。报告忧心忡忡地说，“这个危险是巨大的，不仅由于局势中的军事现实情况，而且由于除美国之外对南越战争努力还没有其他国家提供援助，而且不象会有其他国家提供援助，只有少数例外。相反的，照现在的情况看来，战争按照目前的格局继续得越久，它的范围扩大得越多，美国同在远东和欧洲的盟国的关系受到的压力就越大。”
