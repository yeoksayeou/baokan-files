    Determined to Settle Down in the Border Region
    No matter where I work, no matter what work I do, I am engaging in revolution. Since the Party needs me to work here, I will take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit here.
    I am a new soldier of the "Shanghai Youth Company" of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. I joined the Communist Youth League here and also serve as a deputy platoon leader. As the Spring Festival approaches, I think of the most unforgettable day of my life. This was July 5, 1965, when I had the good fortune to meet our beloved Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen, and listened to the instructions of the Premier. This was the Party's and the people's boundless concern and great encouragement for us. At that time, I deeply felt that the revolutionary burden on my shoulders had become heavier, and our determination to take root in the border region and build the border region became even firmer.
    I am a youth from Shanghai. Before entering Xinjiang, I was a notorious "naughty boy." But after arriving at the military reclamation farm, under the Party's cultivation and education, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and in the great crucible of revolution, I was tempered into a true military reclamation fighter. I remember when I first entered Xinjiang, I was in a bad mood, didn't feel secure at work, and even wanted to write a report asking the organization to transfer me to the Tarim Basin. Later, I changed my mind with the help of the instructor.
    According to the instructor's instructions, I diligently studied the articles "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Only then did I realize that no matter where I work, no matter how big or small the work is, it is all part of the revolutionary work. I made up my mind: Since the Party needs me to work here, I will work and train hard here, take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit here, and become an ordinary new type of worker.
    Later, I learned to pinch cotton tops from the veteran soldiers.
    Once, I got sick and lay in bed with a high fever. When my comrades heard that I was sick, they all came to see me. Those who were older than me were like my elder brothers and sisters, and those who were younger than me were like my younger brothers and sisters. They all hoped that I would get well soon. How could I lie still at this time? I turned over and got out of bed to go to work, but my comrades wouldn't let me go no matter what. For the first time, this stubborn guy known as "He Da Niu" was moved to tears by the warmth of the revolutionary big family.
    After the comrades went to work, I took out "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again and reread the passage "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory." I repeatedly thought about how to overcome my illness. I tried to sit up and felt better. I carried a hoe to the field to work. The comrades couldn't stop me, so they assigned me some light work. I started working without hesitation. Although I felt weak all over, I persevered with the perseverance of "the Foolish Old Man." By noon, the sun was scorching, and I felt like I couldn't hold on any longer, so I lay down on the construction site. In a daze, I vaguely felt someone covering me with clothes and someone shading me from the sun. In the afternoon, when my temperature was taken, it was over 40 degrees Celsius. The instructor immediately sent several comrades to take me to the health clinic. In the health clinic, I studied hard and was eager to return to the company to work. I went back after staying for two days. When the instructor saw that I had not fully recovered, he advised me to go back. I said, "I am here to build the border region. If I can't overcome even this little difficulty, how can I be a youth supporting the border region, a military reclamation fighter!" The instructor couldn't persuade me, so he assigned me to check the quality of reed cutting. The comrades on the construction site were working enthusiastically, so how could I do this light work? But my hands were tied, so I could only worry. In the evening, I studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again. The next day, I cut reeds in the morning and checked the quality in the afternoon. I completed more than one quota in half a day, and finally won the title of "Reed Cutting Expert" in the competition.
    Soon, I joined the Communist Youth League. I remember that on the night of the oath-taking ceremony, my eyes sparkled with tears, and I secretly made a lifelong vow in my heart: to fight to the end for the cause of communism!
    In the year and a half since I entered Xinjiang, under the Party's cultivation, my class consciousness has improved to a certain extent. I also participated in the Autonomous Region's "Second Congress of Active Builders of Socialism by Youth" and was approved as an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works. Although the Party and the people have given me so many honors, I still have many shortcomings and am far from meeting the requirements of the Party and the people. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, be infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in accordance with the Premier's instructions, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, faithfully work for the Party, learn humbly from veteran soldiers, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

### 决心扎根在边疆

    决心扎根在边疆
    不论在什么地方工作，不论做什么工作，都是在干革命。党需要我在这里劳动，我就要在这里生根、发芽、开花、结果
    我是新疆生产建设兵团“上海青年连”的一名军垦新战士。我在这里入了团，并且担任了副排长。在这新春到来的时候，我想起了我一生中最难忘的日子。这一天，就是一九六五年七月五日，我幸福地见到了我们敬爱的周总理和陈副总理，听了总理给我们的指示。这是党和人民对我们的无比关怀和巨大鼓舞。当时，我深深地感到自己身上的革命担子加重了，我们扎根边疆、建设边疆的决心更加坚定了。
    我是上海青年，在入疆以前，是一个有名的“调皮鬼”，可是到了军垦农场后，在党的培养和教育下，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在革命的大熔炉里，把我锻炼成了一名真正的军垦战士。记得刚进疆时，我还闹过情绪，不安心工作，甚至想打报告要求组织调自己到塔里木去，后来在指导员的帮助下才改变过来。
    我根据指导员的指示，努力学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》两篇文章，我才认识到：不论在什么地方工作，不论工作的大小，都是革命工作的一部分，下了决心：党需要我在这里劳动，我就要好好地在这里劳动锻炼，在这里生根、发芽、开花、结果，当一个平凡的新型劳动者。
    后来，我向老战士学会了打棉花群尖。
    有一次，我病了，发着高烧躺在床上。当同志们一听说我生病了，都来看望我，比我大的就象我的哥哥姐姐一样，比我小的就象我的弟弟妹妹一样，他们都盼望着我的病快好。这时，我怎么能躺得住呢？我翻身起床就要下地工作，可是同志们说什么也不让我去。我这个号称“贺大牛”的硬脾气，也头一回被革命大家庭的温暖感动得流下泪来了。
    同志们上工以后，我又拿出《愚公移山》，再读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这一段，我反复地思考，应该怎样去战胜病魔。我试着坐起来，觉得身体好了些。我就扛上砍土镘下地去。同志们缠不过我，就分给我一点轻工作。当时我毫不犹豫地干开了。虽然觉得浑身无力，但是凭借着“愚公”的毅力，也顶了下来。到中午时，太阳晒得正毒，我觉得坚持不住了，就躺在工地上，在蒙胧中，模糊地觉得有人给我盖衣服，有人给我遮太阳。下午一量体温，烧到四十多度，指导员马上派几个同志把我送到了卫生所。在卫生所里，我一面抓紧学习，一面急着要回连队工作。住了两天我就回去了。指导员一看到我的病还未好透，劝我回去。我说：“我是来建设边疆的，连这点困难都克服不了，还算什么支援边疆的青年，军垦战士！”指导员拗不过我，就分配我检查打苇子的质量。工地上同志们干得热火朝天，我怎么能干这轻工作呢？可是手腾不出来，只好干着急。晚上回来，又学习了《愚公移山》，第二天我上午打苇子，下午检查质量。半天时间干完了一个多定额，最后在竞赛中还获得了“打苇子能手”的称号。
    不久，我加入了共青团。记得在入团宣誓那天晚上，我激动的眼里闪着泪花，心里暗暗地许下了终身的誓言：为共产主义事业而奋斗到底！
    我进疆一年半来，在党的培育下，阶级觉悟有了一定提高，还参加了自治区“第二次青年社会主义建设积极分子大会”，并被批准为学习毛主席著作积极分子。虽然党和人民给了自己这么多荣誉，可是在我身上还存在着许多缺点，离党和人民对我的要求还相差很远。今后我一定带着深厚的阶级感情去学习毛主席著作，无限忠诚于毛泽东思想，按照总理的指示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，忠实地为党工作，虚心地向老战士学习，全心全意地为人民服务。
