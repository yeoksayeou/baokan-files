    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is Not Poisonous Weeds
      Zhong Jie
    Comrade Yao Wenyuan said that Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a "poisonous weed," a conclusion that is not convincing. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" basically reflects historical truth. Its performance can only give people this feeling: the local bullies are eliminated, which is gratifying; the return of land and the redressing of unjust verdicts are reasonable. Because in Hai Rui's time, few dared to directly confront the ruling class, the broad masses of peasants only hoped that someone would rise up to overthrow the dynasty or that a "righteous official" would redress their grievances. This is consistent with the social reality of the time and the psychology of the people at the time. Therefore, they regarded Hai Rui as a savior. This can make today's audience think about how pitiful the good life of the peasants at that time was. This can make the audience see how dark the feudal society was, and that if anyone handled things fairly, touching the interests of the landlord class, the royal family would not tolerate it. As for what this historical drama allows people to learn? I think the author wants people to learn Hai Rui's spirit of fighting without fear of the powerful, regardless of personal gains or losses, and being upright and unyielding.
    Comrade Wu Han said in his self-criticism that Hai Rui completely stood on the position of the feudal ruling class. This is not objective. If Hai Rui were like this, then he would certainly not have been punished with dismissal. Comrade Wu Han also said that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" does not serve the proletariat, but serves the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie. This is also not in line with reality. This historical drama could not have been staged in the old China at all, and even if it was staged, it could only be welcomed by the working people, and I am afraid the author would also be in trouble, because the main thrust of this play is directly aimed at the rulers.
    Why did Comrade Wu Han make such a self-criticism? This is because many newspapers and periodicals have recently published articles criticizing and accusing him one after another. Under this trend, he had no choice but to do so.

    《海瑞罢官》不是毒草
      钟杰
    姚文元同志说，吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》是“一株毒草”，这种结论不能令人信服。《海瑞罢官》基本上是反映历史真实的。它的演出只能给人这样一种感觉：地主恶霸被除，大快人心，退田和平冤狱是合理的。因为在海瑞的时代，很少有人敢直接起来同统治阶级对抗，广大农民只希望有人起来推翻这个朝代或有一个“清官”来为他们伸冤雪恨。这既合乎当时社会现实，又合乎当时人民心理。因此，他们把海瑞当作救星。这可以使今天的观众想到，当时农民的好光景何等可怜。这更可以使观众看出，封建社会是何等黑暗，谁若是公正一点办事，触犯了地主阶级利益，皇家就不能容忍。至于这个历史剧让人们学习什么？我认为作者是让人学习海瑞不畏强权、不计个人得失和刚直不阿的斗争精神。
    吴晗同志在自我批评中说，海瑞是完完全全站在封建统治阶级立场上的。这不客观。如果海瑞是这样的话，那末他就必然不会受到罢官的处分了。吴晗同志还说，《海瑞罢官》不是为无产阶级服务，而是为封建地主阶级和资产阶级服务。这也不合实际。这个历史剧在旧中国根本就不可能上演，即使上演了，它只能得到劳苦大众的欢迎，恐怕作者也要祸事临头了，因为这个剧本的主要锋芒是直接指向统治者的。
    为什么吴晗同志做这样的自我批评呢？这是因为，最近许多报刊接二连三地登载了批评和指责他的文章。在这种趋势下，他才不得已而为之。
