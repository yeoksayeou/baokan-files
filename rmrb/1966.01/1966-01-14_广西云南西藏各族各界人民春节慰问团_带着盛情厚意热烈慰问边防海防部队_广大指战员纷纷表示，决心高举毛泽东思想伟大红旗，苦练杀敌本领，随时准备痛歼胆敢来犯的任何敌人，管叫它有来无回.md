    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 12th - The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Spring Festival慰问团 has recently launched extensive activities to warmly comfort the army, navy, and air force and People's Armed Police Force guarding the coastal and border defense lines.

    This慰问团, headed by Zhong Feng, member of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Standing Committee and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, with eleven sub-groups, starting from the 3rd, brought more than seventy theatrical performance groups and film projection teams to the front-line outposts, airports, hospitals, and other places of the troops, conveying the cordial greetings and care of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi to their own soldiers.

    On the 3rd, representatives of the慰问团 traveled through mountains and rivers to reach a哨所 in the midst of the Wanshi Mountains on the Sino-Vietnamese border. Meeting their loved ones, they were particularly affectionate. They gathered together, talked about the situation, and shared family stories. Members of the慰问团 said to the soldiers: Your noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, your revolutionary spirit and heroism of enduring great hardship, standing hard work, not fearing difficulties, and not fearing sacrifice, have set a brilliant example for us to learn from. Soldier Zhang Jixian expressed his determination to the慰问团 with a mountain song: Every festive season makes us miss our loved ones even more, thank you for your heartfelt care, the soldiers only have one thing to say in their hearts, we swear to protect the peace of the motherland's border.

    The慰问团 arrived at a certain airport on the front lines. After comforting all the commanders and fighters, the head of the团, Zhong Feng, held a discussion with personnel who had made meritorious service and five-good soldiers, commending them for their great achievements in the struggle to defend the motherland, and encouraging them to continue their efforts and make new contributions. Zhang Yunbao, the pilot who shot down an intruding American aircraft with his comrades on October 5th last year, said at the meeting that in the new year, he would take Lei Feng and Wang Jie as examples, better study Chairman Mao's writings, with class hatred, diligently practice the skills to kill the enemy, and be ready at any time to thoroughly annihilate the American flying thieves, ensuring they will never return.

    On an island on the coastal defense front, the慰问团 immediately launched extensive慰问 activities upon arrival. 慰问团 member and fisherman representative Mai Hengmin, whose father was killed by American imperialist pirate planes while fishing in international waters on November 18th last year. After accusing the American imperialists of their banditry crimes to the soldiers, Mai Hengmin said: The Chinese people will one day thoroughly settle this blood debt owed by the American imperialists. We must persist in doing a good job in fishery production and fully support the soldiers. Wang Huiying, a 慰问团 member and mother of the island-guarding soldier Huang Shaorui, encouraged the soldiers to remember class hatred and make more meritorious contributions to the people.

    During the慰问 period, the 慰问团 also actively learned from the troops' experience in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and highlighting politics, collected stories of advanced units and advanced individuals, and prepared to bring the good traditions, good work styles, and good experiences of the troops back to the local areas to promote socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12th - People of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are enthusiastically comforting the People's Liberation Army and the Public Security Forces stationed on the border.

    During this period, 慰问团s composed of autonomous prefectures, cities, and special districts also brought theater troupes to perform actively among the troops. The Honghe Autonomous Prefecture慰问团 traveled through mountains and rivers for days to visit the border guards stationed on the borders of Hekou, Jinping and other places. The 慰问团 representatives and art workers from Simao region drove horse caravans, carried props, and comforted the companies and outposts that have guarded the southwest border of the motherland for many years. When the 慰问 team from Malipo County in Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture arrived at the border outpost, they had heart-to-heart talks with the soldiers and jointly expressed their determination to defend the border and build the border.
