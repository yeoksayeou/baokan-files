　　Serving Production, Serving the Peasants
　　Cadre of Yongning Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Yanqing County, Lü Xuguang
　　After watching the film, I was deeply moved by Wang Fushan's spirit of resolutely listening to the Party and "doing business for the revolution, managing finance and trade for the revolution." With this conscious revolutionary spirit, his work is not passively reactive – you buy, I sell; you sell, I collect – but actively exploring and organizing sources of goods, serving production, and serving the peasants. In the film, Li Jianmin, the Party Committee Secretary of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, said to Wang Fushan: "In the future, you should pay more attention to purchasing things from the masses. Only by combining purchasing and sales can you do a good job." Wang Fushan followed Comrade Li Jianmin's instructions and tried every means to organize sideline production and help the masses open up economic resources. Since the masses did not have the habit of collecting wild medicinal herbs, he and Old Man Yangtian went up the mountain to collect medicinal seedlings and investigate medicinal varieties, and then went to the masses to carry out physical exhibitions and propaganda work. Since there was no market for the sawtooth-shaped twigs from Jujube Gully, he tried to find ways to contact and promote sales. He is not only a production organizer, but also a very good propagandist of the Party's policies. In this way, it not only increased the income of production teams and commune members, improved the purchasing power of the masses, but also increased product acquisition resources, so the business became more and more active.

    为生产服务　为农民服务
    延庆县永宁供销社干部　吕绪光
    看了影片，我深深被王福山那种坚决听党的话，“为革命做生意，为革命办财贸”的精神感动了。他有了这种自觉的革命精神，在工作中就不是消极被动——你买我卖，你卖我收，而是积极开辟和组织货源，为生产服务，为农民服务。影片中，县供销社党委书记李健民对王福山说：“你今后还得多注意收购群众的东西，只有把收购和销售结合起来，才能把工作搞好。”王福山按照李健民同志的指示，千方百计地组织副业生产，帮助群众开辟经济来源。群众没有采集野生药材的习惯，他就和杨田老大爷上山采集药苗，调查药材品种，然后到群众中去进行实物展览和宣传鼓动工作。锯齿沟荆梢没有销路，他就想方设法联系推销。他既是一个生产组织者，又是一个很好的党的政策宣传员。这样，既增加了生产队和社员的收入，提高了群众的购买力，又增加了产品收购资源，因此，生意越做越活。
