    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 26th (Telegraph) According to the Cambodian News Agency on January 26th, the Cambodian Ministry of Information issued a communique on January 25th, pointing out that the lies fabricated by the Thai authorities regarding the attack on January 21st by their armed forces against the Cambodian provincial defense post in Chine Sa, Koh Kong Province, are distortions of the truth. Their purpose is not only to cover up the failure of their aggression against Cambodian territory, but also to conceal the essence of their every act of aggression against Cambodian territory.
    The communique states that the Thai authorities described the incident as Cambodian soldiers approaching the Thai village of Hale in four boats and opening fire. The fact is that throughout the night of January 21st to 22nd, Thai troops continuously fired from their Hale post at the defensive installations surrounding the Cambodian Chine Sa post. On the 22nd of January, during the day, they again used artillery from Hale to fire at this post and the village of Bai Nang Changyang south of the post, supported by the artillery of two warships. On January 23rd, two Thai warships also shelled Bai Nang Changyang. From the evening of January 24th to 25th, Thai warships also shelled the Cambodian warship No. 311.
    The communique states that in this Thai invasion, "As of January 23rd, we suffered the following losses: two people were injured by shell explosions (one woman and one soldier). Two houses at the Chine Sa post and one house of residents in Bai Nang Changyang village were damaged by shells."
    The communique points out that this new aggression launched by Thailand is the third aggression against the Cambodian Chine Sa post in recent weeks. In the previous two, the aggressors were defeated and repelled.
    The communique states that the Bangkok authorities' eagerness to fabricate lies after this invasion shows that this new attack on the Chine Sa post was also carefully planned.
    According to reports, Xie Sang, the Cambodian Secretary of State for Information, and Colonel Yang Senan, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, held a press conference on this incident on the 26th.
    Xie Sang pointed out that Cambodia will not allow anyone to realize their plan to annex Cambodian territory. He said, "We will never give up an inch of our land. This is the firm policy of our government towards Thailand and South Vietnam."

    柬新闻部驳斥泰国当局颠倒黑白掩盖侵略罪行
    柬埔寨决不放弃一寸土地
    新华社金边二十六日电  据柬埔寨新闻社二十六日报道，柬埔寨新闻部二十五日发表公报指出，泰国当局为它的武装部队一月二十一日攻击戈公省奇内萨地方的柬埔寨省防军哨所所捏造的谎言，是颠倒黑白，其目的不但在于掩盖它侵略柬埔寨领土所遭到的失败，并且在于掩盖它每次侵略柬埔寨领土的本质。
    公报说，泰国当局把这次事件说成是，柬埔寨士兵乘四条船向泰国哈勒村靠近，并且开火射击。事实是，从一月二十一日到二十二日的整个夜间，泰国军队从他们的哈勒哨所不断向柬埔寨奇内萨哨所周围的防御设置开火。一月二十二日白天，他们又从哈勒用大炮向这个哨所及哨所以南的百囊昌扬村开火，并且得到两艘军舰的大炮的支援。一月二十三日，两艘泰国军舰又炮轰百囊昌扬。一月二十四日到二十五日晚，泰国军舰还炮轰柬埔寨第三一一号军舰。
    公报说，在这次泰国入侵事件中，“截至一月二十三日，我们遭受到如下损失：两人被炮弹爆炸击伤（一名妇女和一名军人）。奇内萨哨所的两间房子和百囊昌扬村居民的一间房屋被炮弹炸坏。”
    公报指出：泰国这次发动的新的侵略是几周来对柬埔寨奇内萨哨所发动的第三次侵略。以前的两次，侵略者都遭到了失败而被击退。
    公报说，曼谷当局在这次入侵后迫不及待地捏造谎言，表明它这次对奇内萨哨所发动的新的进攻，也是精心策划的。
    据报道，柬埔寨新闻国务秘书谢桑和柬埔寨王家武装部队副总参谋长杨森安上校，二十六日就这一事件举行了记者招待会。
    谢桑指出，柬埔寨不许任何人实现兼并柬埔寨领土的计划。他说，“我们决不放弃我们的一寸土地。这是我国政府现在对泰国和南越的坚定政策。”
