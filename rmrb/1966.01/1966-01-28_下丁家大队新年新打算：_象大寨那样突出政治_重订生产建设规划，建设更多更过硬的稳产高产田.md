    Xia Dingjia Brigade of Daliujia Commune, Huang County, Shandong Province, and its vast number of cadres and members are determined to further emphasize politics in the new year, and continue to govern the mountains, manage the rivers, and consolidate the land with the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance of Dazhai, build more and better high and stable yield farmland, seize a bumper agricultural harvest in 1966, and greet the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan with practical actions.
    In early December last year, Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, visited Xia Dingjia. At the beginning of this year, Zhang Shuqin, the head of Xia Dingjia Brigade, went to Dazhai to learn from their experience. Through visits and comparisons, the people of Xia Dingjia, in addition to finding many gaps in production, found an even more important gap, that is, the political and ideological work was not as deeply, meticulously, and thoroughly grasped as Dazhai. The cadres and members’ thinking of farming for the revolution was not as firm, complete, and thorough as that of the Dazhai people. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, they prominently grasped political and ideological work. The cadres took Chen Yonggui as an example and conducted self-examination of their work style and ideological style. Some expressed that they would learn Chen Yonggui's revolutionary style of working wherever they went and learning wherever they went with humility. The members also expressed that in the new year, they must be more actively involved in collective production labor, be more fearless of hardship and difficulty, and do a good job in all production and construction work, just like the people of Dazhai.
    The Xia Dingjia Brigade re-studied and formulated the 1966 production and construction plan, and put forward higher requirements for this year's farmland capital construction.

    下丁家大队新年新打算：
    象大寨那样突出政治
    重订生产建设规划，建设更多更过硬的稳产高产田
    山东省黄县大吕家公社下丁家大队广大干部社员，在新的一年中，决心进一步突出政治，继续以大寨艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神治山、治水、整地，建设更多、更过硬的稳产高产农田，夺取一九六六年农业丰收，以实际行动迎接第三个五年计划的第一年。
    去年十二月初，山西省昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵曾经到下丁家参观访问，今年年初，下丁家大队大队长张书勤又到大寨取经。通过参观、对比，下丁家人除在生产上找到不少差距以外，找到了一条更重要的差距，就是政治思想工作不如大寨抓得深，抓得细，抓得透，干部和社员为革命种田的思想还不如大寨人那样牢固，那样完全，那样彻底。因此，今年一开始，他们就突出地抓了政治思想工作。干部们以陈永贵做榜样，对照检查了自己的工作作风和思想作风。有的表示要学习陈永贵走到那里干到那里的革命作风，有的表示要学习陈永贵走到那里学到那里的谦虚好学的精神。社员们也纷纷表示，在新的一年一定要象大寨人那样，更加积极地参加集体生产劳动，更加不怕艰苦和困难，把各项生产建设工作搞好。
    下丁家大队重新研究、制定了一九六六年的生产建设规划，对今年的农田基本建设提出了更高的要求。
