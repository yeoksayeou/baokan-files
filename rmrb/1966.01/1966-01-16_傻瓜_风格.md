    “Fool” Style
    Sun Shijie
    I used to think that "fool" was just a word to scold people; not long ago, I took a trip to Inner Mongolia and learned that there really is a "fool" in the farmland.
    This kind of "fool" has some special characteristics. From the time the flowers fall and the melons set, until the frost falls around the Double Ninth Festival and the melons are harvested, it just grows greedily. Only after being stored at home for a month or two does the melon flesh gradually change from white to yellow, from raw to ripe, becoming a rare sweet and crisp melon variety in winter, which can be eaten until after the New Year.
      Another characteristic of the "fool" is its amazing vitality. Plant the melon seeds in the ground in spring, and there is no need to spend too much effort taking care of it. After the seedlings emerge, there is no need to pinch the tips or press the vines, and they will quickly bloom and bear fruit. In late autumn, when "a gust of autumn wind brings coolness, and three white dews bring two frosts," many other crops have been harvested, but only the verdant "fool" can withstand frost and remain strong, still growing vigorously in the fields.
    Regardless of evil winds, cold rain, hail, or frost, they do not hinder the growth of the "fool," so it grows quite large. It is precisely because of this that the farmers call it "fool." However, when farmers talk to me about the "fool," there is no ridicule on their faces, but rather a special affectionate feeling, as if saying: "Look, how lovely this kind of fool is!"
    The "fool" in the farmland made me think of people. Comrade Wang Jie is a revolutionary "fool." Wherever the Party sows him, he "takes root, blossoms, and bears fruit" there. He asks little of others and gives much to others. He lives for the revolution, grows for the revolution, and finally dedicates his precious life to the revolution. In short, he wholeheartedly serves the revolution and everything for the people, fully carrying forward the revolutionary "fool" style, truly achieving "utter devotion to others without any thought of self."
      "How foolish it is to completely forget oneself for the sake of others!" This is the opinion of another kind of self-proclaimed "clever" person. In a society where class struggle still exists, isn't this a kind of ideological "evil wind," "cold rain," and "frost"? However, true revolutionaries have always been unmoved by such arguments. Comrade Lei Feng said it well: "I want to be a person who benefits the people and benefits the country. If this is called a 'fool,' then I am willingly such a 'fool.' The revolution needs such 'fools,' and construction also needs such 'fools.' I only have one heart, and my heart is wholeheartedly towards the Party, towards socialism, and towards communism." The two different views on foolishness reflect two different worldviews. Lei Feng and Wang Jie, precisely because they have a communist worldview, are "willingly" to be revolutionary "fools" and are able to fully carry forward the revolutionary "fool" style.

    “傻瓜”风格
    孙士杰
    我从前以为，“傻瓜”只是一个骂人的词儿；不久前到内蒙古跑了一趟，才知道庄稼地里真有一种“傻瓜”。
    这种“傻瓜”，很有些特别的地方。从落花坐瓜起，到霜降前后下瓜止，它只是一味贪长，待收藏到家里放个把月，瓜瓤才渐渐由白变黄，由生变熟，成为冬季稀有的甜而且脆的瓜品，一直能吃到过阳历年。
      “傻瓜”的另一个特点是，有惊人的生命力。春天把瓜籽种在地里，就再无需花太多精力侍弄它。瓜苗出土以后，不用掐尖，也不用压蔓，很快就会开花结瓜。晚秋时节，“一阵秋风一阵凉，三场白露两场霜”，其它许多作物都收获了，独有碧绿的“傻瓜”，能够凌霜傲寒，依然在田地里猛长。
    无论歪风、冷雨、雹打、霜冻，都不碍“傻瓜”生长，所以它的个儿结得挺大。也正因为如此，农民才取名叫它“傻瓜”。然而，当农民跟我谈论“傻瓜”的时候，他们脸上非但没有任何讥笑的意味，反而流露出一种特别亲昵的感情，仿佛在说：“你看，这种瓜傻得多么可爱！”
    从庄稼地里的傻瓜，使我想到了人。王杰同志就是革命的“傻瓜”。党把他撒在那里，他“就在那里生根、开花、结果”。他求于人的甚少，给予人的甚多。他为革命而生，为革命而长，最后为革命献出自己宝贵的生命。总之，他一心为革命，一切为人民，充分发扬了革命的“傻瓜”风格，真正做到了“毫不利己，专门利人”。
      “为了别人完全忘掉了自己，那该有多么傻呀！”这是另一种自以为“聪明”的人的议论。在阶级斗争仍然存在的社会里，这不正是一种思想上的“歪风”、“冷雨”和“霜冻”吗？但是，真正的革命者，在这种议论面前从来是无动于衷的。雷锋同志说得好：“我要做一个有利于人民、有利于国家的人。如果说这是‘傻子’，那我是甘心愿意做这样的‘傻子’的，革命需要这样的‘傻子’，建设也需要这样的‘傻子’。我就是长着一个心眼，我一心向着党，向着社会主义，向着共产主义。”对于傻的两种不同看法，反映了两种不同的世界观。雷锋、王杰，正因为他们具有了共产主义的世界观，所以他们才“甘心愿意”做革命的“傻瓜”，才能够充分发扬革命的“傻瓜”风格。
