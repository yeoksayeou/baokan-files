    The materials from the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant's continuous leap forward can persuade many people, those who do not value highlighting politics, those who do not believe that production must be commanded by politics, to wake up and consciously highlight politics in all their work.

    The reason why the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant has been able to reach three peaks in production technology is because it first reached three peaks in political thought. Without the continuous leap forward in political thought, there could be no continuous leap forward in production technology. The victory in production at the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant is the victory of highlighting politics, the victory of politics commanding production.

    Highlighting politics means never forgetting class struggle at all times and in all matters. If the content of class struggle is removed, what politics is left? The series of struggles that the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant has carried out over the past eight years—the struggle between revolution and "restoration," the struggle between offense and defense, the struggle between active balance and passive balance, the struggle between resting on achievements and continuous revolution, the struggle between following in others' footsteps and catching up with and surpassing them—are all struggles between proletarian ideology and various non-proletarian ideologies, or rather, they are all class struggles. The process of the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant's development of production is permeated with a clear red line, the red line of class struggle.

    The series of struggles that the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant has carried out over the past eight years have all grasped the directional living thoughts. Is it to advance or retreat? Is it to strive for the upper reaches or to be content with the middle reaches? Is it to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically or less, slower, worse, and more expensively? Grasping such living thoughts means grasping the core of political and ideological work, grasping the key link of class struggle, and being able to educate and inspire all employees. In this way, political and ideological work is enlivened, and class struggle is also enlivened. Every time a struggle is carried out, there is a change in people's mental outlook, and there is a leap forward in the enterprise's production level.

    Highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has always held that in all work, revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude must be combined. Every step forward that the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant has taken in production and scientific research is the result of combining revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude. Advanced technologies such as coal powder injection into blast furnaces were created with revolutionary drive and also with a scientific attitude.

    The invention and adoption of new technologies always take place in struggle. When the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant decided to use coal powder injection into blast furnaces to increase production, foreign experts believed that it was impossible and even dangerous. However, the workers and technicians of the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant were not intimidated by these experts' "lessons." They developed a revolutionary spirit and advanced despite the difficulties. They believed in materialist dialectics. Everything can be divided into two, and if there is a danger of explosion, it is possible to find a way to prevent it. They treated this new technology with a rigorous scientific attitude, conducted investigations and research in different types of brother factories and mines, repeatedly conducted experiments, and gradually mastered a large amount of data from practice, grasped the objective laws of coal powder injection into blast furnaces, and found measures to prevent nodulation and explosion.

    It is very clear that with revolutionary spirit, there is the courage to overcome all difficulties. With a scientific attitude, there are ways to overcome all difficulties. By closely combining the two, we can be invincible and overcome all obstacles in production struggles and scientific experiments. The achievements of the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant are a vivid example.

    Scientific attitude is an honest and down-to-earth attitude. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "We should be honest and down-to-earth in doing things. If we want to accomplish a few things in the world, it is impossible without an honest attitude." The people of Daqing are such honest and down-to-earth people. The workers and technicians of the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant are also such honest and down-to-earth people. They used their soaring revolutionary drive in investigation and research, scientific experiments, exploration and mastering the laws of objective things, that is, in honestly and down-to-earth doing things. As a result, they accomplished great things.

    Now, a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy is rising in various places. The higher the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, the more the leaders must cherish and protect the enthusiasm of the masses. This requires emphasizing a strict scientific attitude, so that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses can be used where it is most needed and achieve the greatest practical results.

    革命精神和科学态度相结合的胜利
    石钢炼铁厂持续跃进的材料，可以说服很多人，说服那些不重视突出政治的人，说服那些不相信必须用政治统帅生产的人，使他们清醒起来，在自己的一切工作当中，自觉地突出政治。
    石钢炼铁厂所以能在生产技术方面登上三个高峰，就是因为首先在政治思想上登上了三个高峰。没有政治思想的持续跃进，就不可能有生产技术的持续跃进。石钢炼铁厂生产上的胜利，就是突出政治的胜利，就是政治统帅生产的胜利。
    突出政治，就是时时事事不要忘记阶级斗争。如果抽去阶级斗争的内容，还有什么政治？石钢炼铁厂八年以来所进行的一系列斗争：革命还是“复古”的斗争，攻还是守的斗争，积极平衡还是消极平衡的斗争，守着成绩过日子还是不断革命的斗争，踩着别人脚印走还是赶上、超过的斗争，都是无产阶级思想同各种非无产阶级思想的斗争，或者说都是阶级斗争。石钢炼铁厂发展生产的过程中，贯串着一条鲜明的红线，就是阶级斗争的红线。
    石钢炼铁厂八年来进行的一系列斗争，都抓住了方向性的活思想。是前进还是后退？是力争上游还是甘居中游？是多快好省还是少慢差费？抓住了这样的活思想，就抓住了政治思想工作的核心，就抓住了阶级斗争这条纲，就能教育全体职工，鼓舞全体职工。这样，政治思想工作做活了，阶级斗争也抓活了。每进行一次斗争，人们的精神面貌就有一次变化，企业的生产水平就有一次跃进。
    突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想从来认为，在一切工作当中，都要使革命精神和科学态度相结合。石钢炼铁厂在生产和科学研究方面每前进一步，都是革命精神和科学态度相结合的结果。高炉喷吹煤粉这样的先进技术，是用革命干劲闯出来的，也是用科学态度闯出来的。
    新技术的发明和采用，总是在斗争中进行的。石钢炼铁厂决定采用高炉喷吹煤粉提高产量的时候，外国专家认为那是办不到的，甚至有爆炸的危险。但是，石钢炼铁厂的工人和技术人员并没有被这些专家的“教训”所吓倒。他们发扬革命精神，逆难而进。他们相信唯物辩证法。事物都可以一分为二，有爆炸的危险，就可能找到防止爆炸的办法。他们用严谨的科学态度去对待这项新技术，到不同类型的兄弟厂矿进行调查研究，反复进行试验，从实践中逐步掌握了大量数据，掌握了高炉喷吹煤粉的客观规律，找到了防止结瘤和爆炸的措施。
    十分清楚，有了革命精神，就有了克服一切困难的勇气。有了科学态度，就有了克服一切困难的办法。把两者密切结合起来，我们在生产斗争和科学实验中，就能够战无不胜，攻无不克。石钢炼铁厂的成就，就是一个活生生的例子。
    科学态度就是老老实实的态度。毛泽东同志说过，“我们应该是老老实实地办事，在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”大庆人就是这样老老实实的人。石钢炼铁厂的工人和技术人员，也是这样老老实实的人。他们把冲天的革命干劲，用在调查研究、科学实验、探索和掌握客观事物规律，也就是老老实实地办事上。这样，他们果然办成了大事。
    现在，一个新的增产节约运动的高潮正在各地兴起。群众的革命干劲越高，领导者越要珍惜和保护群众的热情。这就必须强调严格的科学态度，使群众的革命热情用到刀刃上，发挥最大的实效。
