    Nothing is Impossible, If You Are Willing to Try
    He Furong, Dispatcher of Well Workover Department, Daqing Oilfield
    Since 1963, I have consistently studied Chairman Mao's works. I deeply realize that Chairman Mao's works are not only a sharp weapon for class struggle but also a sharp weapon for the struggle for production and scientific experimentation. Once, the water plugging process in an oil well began. The formation pressure of the oil well was high, requiring high-density mud. At that time, the chemicals and technology for treating the mud could only produce mud with a specific gravity of 1.4. A certain well had four blowouts in a row, resulting in four days of work stoppage, which worried the workers and cadres very much. At this time, the leading comrades asked me to immediately prepare high-density mud. However, I had never done this work before. Could I take on this responsibility? Just as I was hesitating, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, and we must see if we dare to shoulder it." I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and at this critical moment, I should act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Therefore, I immediately agreed to carry out the experimental work. According to conventional methods, experiments should be carried out indoors, and it would take half a year to promote it from the beginning to the on-site trial. So I studied "On Practice." Chairman Mao said: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." Chairman Mao's teaching pointed out the direction for me. I was determined to rely on the Party and the masses to produce high-density mud. In the absence of a laboratory, I carried medicines and instruments to the well during the day, added weighting materials to the mud with the workers, and carefully observed and recorded the changes in the mud. At night, I carried two buckets of mud back for experiments. A desk in the dispatch room became the test bench, and rice bowls, washbasins, and cups were used as containers for chemical reagents. All of the dozens of expected drugs were tested, and each test failed. I opened "On Practice" again to study. I understood the truth that "failure is the mother of success" and "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit," and my confidence was greatly increased, and I was full of courage to continue the experiment. In this way, after four days and four nights of experiments, it was finally discovered that after reducing the concentration of water glass to one-fifth, the viscosity also met the requirements of the construction design. After more than two hundred repeated tests, high-density mud was finally obtained. It was used on site early the next morning, and the effect was good, allowing the project that had been suspended for four days to resume work.
    Through this practice, I deeply realized that as long as we always keep Chairman Mao's teachings in mind and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything, no matter how great the difficulties are, they can be solved.

    天下无难事  只要肯攀登
    大庆采油井下作业处调度员  何富荣
    从一九六三年以来，我一直坚持学习毛主席著作。我深深体会到，毛主席著作不仅是阶级斗争的锐利武器，而且是生产斗争、科学实验的锐利武器。有一次，油井堵水工艺开始了，油井地层压力高，需要高比重泥浆，而当时处理泥浆的药品和技术，只能配制出比重一点四的泥浆。某井连续发生了四次井喷，造成四天停工，工人干部都着急得很。这时，领导同志要我立即配出高比重泥浆。可是，我没有干过这项工作，能不能负起这份责任？正犹豫不决的时候，我想起了毛主席的教导：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”我是一个共青团员，在这紧急关头，应该按毛主席的教导去做。于是，我立即答应开展试验工作。按照常规，试验要在室内进行，从开始到现场试用，需要半年时间才能推广。于是我就学习《实践论》。毛主席说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”毛主席的教导，给我指出了方向，我决心依靠党，依靠群众，搞出高比重泥浆来。在没有试验室的条件下，我就白天背着药品、仪器上井，和工人一块加重泥浆，详细观察、记录泥浆变化情况，晚上挑两桶泥浆回来搞试验。调度室的一张办公桌成了试验台，饭碗、脸盆、口杯就是装化学药品的容器。预计的十几种药品都试验过了，试验一次失败一次。我又翻开《实践论》学习。我明确了“失败者成功之母”、“吃一堑长一智”的道理，信心倍增，勇气十足，坚持继续试验。这样，经过四天四夜试验，终于发现将水玻璃浓度降到五分之一以后，粘度也满足了施工设计要求，又经过二百多次反复试验，最后得到了高比重泥浆。第二天一早就在现场使用，效果良好，使停工四天的工程复工了。
    通过这次实践，使我深深地体会到，只要我们时时刻刻牢记毛主席的教导，处处按毛主席的指示办事，不论有多大困难，也是可以解决的。
