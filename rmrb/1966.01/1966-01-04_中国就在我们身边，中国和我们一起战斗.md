    South Vietnamese Listeners Write to Radio Beijing Praising the Support of the Chinese People
    China is Right Beside Us, China Fights with Us
    The Voice of China, Like a Magical Power, Reaches the South Vietnamese Front Lines, Encouraging Soldiers to Strike Fatal Blows Against the Enemy
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Listeners from South Vietnam, Wen Sen and others, recently wrote to Radio Beijing, warmly praising the Chinese people's firm support for the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and expressing the South Vietnamese people's love and friendship for the Chinese people.
    South Vietnamese listener Wen Sen wrote in his letter:
    Beijing is watched by friends from the five continents of the world at all times, and it is also a place that mobilizes and encourages us to carry out revolutionary struggles. Whenever Radio Beijing broadcasts, everyone gathers quietly to listen. It is like a magical power that reaches the soldiers on the front lines who are fighting against U.S. aggression, constantly giving the enemy fatal blows.
    Out of love for you, and out of the great Chinese people's sincere feelings, deep understanding, and selfless assistance for the cause of liberation in South Vietnam, for the first time in our country, which is undergoing arduous struggles, I express to you, and through you, to the Chinese people, to young friends, to the outstanding soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, my deep affection for them, and express my supreme love and respect for Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, just as I do for President Ho, the Vietnamese people, and our beloved motherland.
    South Vietnamese listener Ruan Jian wrote in his letter:
    Not long ago, Radio Beijing broadcast "Letters from the South" to every corner of the globe. I clearly heard the revolutionary heroic words of our southern children, which is exactly the voice of the Chinese daughter playing the role of A Xia.
    Comrades! What is the reason that makes comrades such as the adapters, directors, and actors achieve such outstanding results? I think it is because you have a heart that is loyal to the Party and loyal to the people, and it is the result of the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, developing popular and realistic literature and art under the education, leadership, and organization of the Chinese Communist Party. You embody the lofty internationalist class friendship through dialogue, actions, and deeds. You connect the expectations of the Chinese Communist Party and the 650 million Chinese people with the 30 million hearts of our heroic Vietnamese people. I am proud that the Chinese Party, government, and people have such a skilled and bravely fighting literary and artistic team like you.
    Comrades! Although China is thousands of miles away from us, on the front lines, in combat, in daily work and life, even in towns temporarily occupied by the enemy and in remote mountainous areas, you are always by our side. (Attached picture)

    越南南方听众写信给北京电台赞扬中国人民的支持
    中国就在我们身边，中国和我们一起战斗
    中国的声音象一股神奇的力量传到南越前线，鼓舞战士给敌人以致命的打击
    本报讯越南南方听众文森等人最近写信给北京广播电台，热烈赞扬中国人民对南越人民抗美救国斗争的坚决支援，并表达了越南南方人民对中国人民的热爱与友谊。
    越南南方听众文森在来信中写道：
    北京是世界上五大洲的朋友们时时刻刻地注视的，也是动员和鼓舞着我们进行革命斗争的地方。每当北京电台播音时，大家都安静地围在一起收听。它象一股神奇的力量传到正在进行抗美斗争最前线的战士身上，不断地给敌人以致命的打击。
    从热爱你们的心情出发，从伟大的中国人民对越南南方解放事业抱有真挚的感情、深刻的谅解和无私的援助出发，我第一次在我们正在进行顽强斗争的国土上，向你们并通过你们，向中国人民，向年轻的朋友，向优秀的解放军战士们，表示我对他们深厚的感情，表达我对毛主席、中国人民，正象我对胡主席、越南人民和我们亲爱的祖国那样崇高的敬爱。
    越南南方听众阮蹇在来信中说：
    不久前北京广播电台把《南方来信》传播到地球上的每一个角落，我清楚地听到我们南方儿女洋溢着革命的豪言壮语，这正是中国的女儿在扮演阿霞这一角色的声音。
    同志们！是什么原因使改编、导演和演员等同志获得这么出色的成就呢？我想，是由于你们有忠于党、忠于人民的心，是你们在中国共产党的教育、领导和组织下，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民发展大众化、现实化的文学艺术的结果。你们通过对话、动作和行动体现了崇高的国际主义的阶级友爱。你们把中国共产党和六亿五千万中国人民的期望和我们英雄的越南人民的三千万颗心连结在一起，我为中国党、政府和人民有你们这样业务熟练、勇敢战斗的一支文艺队伍而感到自豪。
    同志们！中国虽然和我们远隔千里，但在前沿阵地上，在战斗中，在日常工作和生活中，甚至在暂时被敌人占领的城镇里以及在偏僻山区，你们无时无刻不在我们的身边。（附图片）
