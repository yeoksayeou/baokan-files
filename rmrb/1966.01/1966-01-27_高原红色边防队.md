    Plateau Red Border Defense Team

    Chagola Mountain stands among the icy peaks and snow-capped ridges of the Himalayas. It is more than 5,000 meters above sea level, higher than three Mount Tais put together. A border defense team is stationed on this mountain. For several years, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome numerous difficulties, and successfully completed the glorious task of defending the motherland's border. They have been rated as a "Four Good" company for five consecutive years. They are the model of "Four Good" companies in the Tibet Military Region. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense conferred on them the honorary title of "Plateau Red Border Defense Team."

    High Altitude, Higher Revolutionary Spirit

    The Chagola Border Defense Team was established in 1961. It is bitterly cold and severely lacking in oxygen. The soldiers had severe altitude sickness when they first arrived, with headaches, weak legs, loss of appetite, and insomnia. They had to carry ice blocks from several miles away to melt for cooking, and due to the low air pressure, water boiled at just over 60 degrees Celsius, resulting in half-cooked, scorched food. The temperature was low, and it took three hours to boil a pot of water. In addition, there were no houses, and they lived in tents and dugouts, with wind and snow blowing straight in, often covering the blankets with thick snow.

    Facing one difficulty after another, the Party branch organized everyone to study a passage from Chairman Mao's "On the Chongqing Negotiations": "What is work? Work is struggle..." The soldiers stood on the mountaintop, gazing at the opposite pass. In those days, it was from here that the invading troops of British imperialism had invaded our Tibet, causing our Tibetan class brothers to suffer long-term double oppression from feudal serf owners and imperialism. Comrades had heard the blood and tearful accusations of the emancipated serfs about the hellish life of old Tibet. Could we allow such a life to return? If we don't set up a checkpoint here, who will? If we don't come to defend, who will? Instructor Zhou Wenjun also told everyone the story of the Red Army crossing the snow-capped mountains and led everyone in studying Chairman Mao's quotations: "This army of ours is entirely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly in the interests of the people." The soldiers said: The revolutionary predecessors dared to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire for the people; we can stand firm and take root on the snow-capped mountains for the people!

    "One person suffers, ten thousand are happy!" "The needs of the people of the motherland are the volunteers of the revolutionary soldiers!" This is the soldiers' answer.

    Is the air thin? Our political atmosphere is thick. Are the mountain peaks very high? Our revolutionary fighting spirit is even higher! Look, the soldiers are standing proudly on their posts, facing the wind and snow that carries bean-sized pebbles. At night, the blankets are covered with snow, and the soldiers, freezing and unable to sleep after coming off duty, gather around a yak-dung fire, writing poems full of revolutionary enthusiasm, sentence by sentence:

    Settling down in the snow mountains,
    Standing among the clouds and mists.
    Gravel stings the face,
    Wind and snow pierce the bones.
    Heart is happy for the people,
    Willing to accompany hardship.

    Chagola Mountain is still cold and snowy, and the air is thin, but the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is hoisted high on Chagola Mountain. The comrades of the border defense team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are prepared to conquer all difficulties.

    Settling Down on the Snow Mountain as "Yu Gong"

    Having the determination to settle down on the snow mountain, they must fight with the sky and fight with the earth to change the environment on the snow mountain. But Chagola Mountain has no building materials, and even water is scarce; there is only ice, snow, and weathered gravel. How can we build fortifications and barracks here? The Party branch believes that as long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, anything can be done. Everyone repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The soldiers said, we must be new Yu Gongs on the snow mountain, overcome all difficulties, transform the natural environment, and build a border outpost.

    The soldiers went down the mountain for ten miles to find soil that could be used for making adobe bricks, and then they began to make bricks. Because the weather was too cold, the newly mixed mud froze with a layer of ice as soon as the cold wind blew, so the soldiers took off their shoes and socks and stepped on the mud to make bricks. Hail hit their bodies, and sweat dripped into the mud. Every adobe brick is condensed with the revolutionary will of the soldiers.

    Carrying bricks and stones up the mountain was even more difficult. Here, walking empty-handed is like carrying a load, making people pant for breath, let alone carrying heavy loads up the mountain. But these "snow mountain Yu Gongs" were determined to show off their power to the snow mountain. Everyone strived to carry more, finally moving the materials to the mountain. Soon, the first row of cave dwellings, the first dormitory, the first canteen, the first club, and even a basketball court appeared on this high snow mountain.

    The most difficult thing on the high mountain is the lack of water to drink. In order to obtain a water source, the soldiers painstakingly searched and traced, and finally found a fist-sized water nest with a chopstick-thick trickle. They split mountains and dug soil, and after one failure after another, they finally successfully built two reservoirs. The soldiers said: Chagola, no matter how high the mountain is, it bows to the soldiers. The mountain is like a giant wave, and the clouds are like a sea, all under our feet. The icy peaks and snow ridges are bitter and cold, but we can turn them into a paradise with our own hands.

    The higher authorities were very concerned about the lives of the soldiers of the Chagola Border Defense Team, sending them generators, electric lights, warm and soft down quilts, canned fruit, and so on. However, the soldiers on Chagola Mountain were unwilling to rely on the higher authorities for everything. They promoted the spirit of Dazhai, relied on their own efforts, relied on the mountain for their livelihood, hunting and raising pigs, to ensure that all the soldiers were strong and healthy.

    With the material life improved, the spiritual life must also be enlivened. They played ball, sang, and were happy. Every month, they also held an evening party, self-directed and self-acted, singing and acting. In five years, they held sixty-nine evening parties, performing more than six hundred programs (nearly three hundred self-compiled), extensively praising the good people and good deeds of their own unit and other units, enlivening their lives and inspiring their fighting spirit. The soldiers' majestic voices sang out revolutionary passion: "The revolutionary soldiers' hearts are like fire, and the songs melt the snowy river."

    For the sake of revolution, we must strengthen our physique. The soldiers often organized activities such as hunting, carrying things, and playing basketball. They competed to carry back goods that could have been transported by vehicles from dozens of miles away. Through exercise, everyone's ability to adapt to high altitudes was enhanced, and their weight also generally increased. The soldiers came to the conclusion: "Difficulty is like a spring, it depends on how strong you are. If you are strong, it is weak; if you are weak, it is strong."

    Focusing on the World While Defending the Motherland

    In early spring, the border defense team carried out its first night ambush mission. They quietly lay on the ice and snow and frozen hard ground. The cold wind penetrated their leather coats and fur shoes. In the first half of the night, the soldiers' body heat melted the ice, snow, and frozen soil, and in the second half of the night, the ground under their bodies turned into frozen soil and frost again. The severe cold tested the soldiers, and frostbite threatened them.

    After returning from the ambush, the Party branch led the soldiers in discussing how to deal with new hardships and difficulties, organizing everyone to study the heroic deeds of revolutionary predecessors. Why were the Red Army able to endure hunger and cold to climb the snow-capped mountains and walk through the grasslands during the Long March? Why were the comrades in the enemy's prisons not afraid of torture and remained unyielding? Before their heroic sacrifice, did Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, and Zhang Yingxin not know that they would be crushed to pieces? The soldiers said, they knew it completely, but the lives of revolutionaries belong to the people, and when the people need us to make contributions, we must step forward! After a heated discussion, the soldiers' courage doubled, and their will became stronger. Everyone scrambled to participate in the ambush. They sent off the stars and moon every night and welcomed the colorful clouds every morning. Returning in the morning, everyone was full of energy and sang loudly: "The border guards have great responsibility..."

    Under the connivance of imperialism and modern revisionism, the Indian reactionaries continuously carried out armed provocations against us. The soldiers of the Chagola Border Defense Team vigilantly stuck to their posts. Carrying guns on their shoulders, Chairman Mao's works in their pockets, a mouthful of snow and a mouthful of dry food, they patrolled day and night in the wind and snow, guarding the motherland's border. One night, the patrol team bivouacked on the Great Snow Mountain and felt the biting cold even when they were around the yak-dung fire. At this difficult moment, soldier Hu Tongde took out Chairman Mao's works from his pocket and read a passage to everyone: "The more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is a good comrade." At this time, the comrades seemed to be personally listening to the leader's teachings, as if Chairman Mao was by their side, and immediately felt infinite warmth.

    Under such difficult conditions, they insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books every day. The soldiers studied when they encountered difficulties, studied when they had problems, and proposed four "un-downs": lack of culture cannot bring us down, severe cold cannot bring us down, achievements cannot make us boast, and too much work cannot squeeze us down. At first, there were not enough of Chairman Mao's books, and everyone wanted to study, what to do? Copy! Copy Chairman Mao's books into notebooks and remember them in their hearts. The soldiers used every spare moment to copy books, and in a week, they copied more than 120 articles by Chairman Mao in various notebooks and on paper of various colors and shapes. The soldiers said: A day without studying Chairman Mao's works is like not seeing the sun in the snow mountain and not getting warmth. We must be like Wang Jie, learn a little and use a little. How Chairman Mao said it, that's how we do it.

    The soldiers stood on Chagola, looking at Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They expressed their feelings in poetry: "Willing to spend a hundred years with the snow mountain, not thinking of the beautiful scenery of the hometown. The red sentry post is a heroic man, focusing on the world while defending the motherland."

    Revolutionary Furnace Refines New People

    In recent years, the soldiers of the Chagola Border Defense Team have creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, faced the wind, snow, and severe cold, and overcome hardships and difficulties; the wind, snow, severe cold, hardships, and difficulties have also tempered the soldiers of the border defense team. Their awareness has become higher and higher, and their fighting spirit has become stronger and stronger. Chagola has become a furnace for training successors to the proletarian revolution.

    Please look at the people's soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought:

    Wang Chengquan, the captain of the border defense team, lived in a bunker on the highest mountain for a long time, had difficulty breathing, and often could not sleep well, but he insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, often reading late into the night. Last year, he got sick, and the leadership wanted to transfer him down from Chagola, but he firmly demanded to stay. He said, he would do as much as he could, and if he couldn't do heavy work, he would do light work. It would be fine to be a cook in Chagola.

    Once, old soldier Zhang Mingquan caught a cold, but he did not say a word and still insisted on participating in the patrol. When he could not hold on while climbing a snow peak, he thought of Chairman Mao's words: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." He climbed up in one breath. After arriving at the garrison, the cadres persuaded him to rest, but he quietly went to help the cooking squad to burn firewood and shake the generator for the radio station. He said: "Revolutionaries cannot be afraid of hardship, and those who are afraid of hardship cannot make a revolution." He deeply realized that in the most difficult times, with Chairman Mao's words as instructions, no difficulty is insurmountable.

    Radio operator Ning Xiaohua studied diligently with a dictionary in one hand and Chairman Mao's works in the other, learning a little and using a little. He worked in the border defense team for five years, and for five years he had not left the high and cold mountain area, for five years he had not taken off his cotton clothes, and for five years he had not seen trees. Some of the comrades who enlisted at the same time as him became cadres, and he is still a radio operator. He said, "Being a cadre and being a soldier are both serving the people. Whatever the Party wants me to do, I will do it. When I shake the motor, it enables the reporting of situations from below to above, and the communication from above to below, connecting the snow mountain with Beijing and connecting with the world's revolutionary struggle! My work is very meaningful, and I am willing to shake the generator for the revolution for the rest of my life."

    Pang Fanglun, a five-good soldier model and deputy squad leader of the border defense team, fell into a trench covered with snow on duty once. He was buried in the snow, crawling and crawling, and he insisted on climbing to the position. Snow got into his clothes, and the piercing cold wind kept blowing, but he stood firmly at his post. When others asked him why he could endure such great hardship, he said that if he stood on duty for one shift, the 600 million people would get an hour of peace and construction time and would support the world's people's revolution.

    In recent years, dozens of comrades have left Chagola due to demobilization, retirement, and job transfers. But everyone was reluctant to leave this place, and many people left in tears. Some comrades asked to leave their names on the roster of the border defense team. They all said that once the motherland needs it, they will immediately go to the snow mountain.

    The comrades of the Chagola Border Defense Team firmly emphasized politics, earnestly read Chairman Mao's books, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, thought about the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, regarded hardship as glory, regarded hardship as happiness, and like a snow lotus in full bloom, bloomed proudly on the Himalayas.

    高原红色边防队
    查果拉山，矗立在喜马拉雅山的冰峰雪岭之中，它海拔五千多米，比三个泰山还要高出一头。在这座山上，住着一个边防队。几年来，他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，战胜了重重艰难困苦，出色地完成了保卫祖国边疆的光荣任务，连续五年被评为四好连队。他们是西藏军区四好连队的标兵。最近，国防部授予他们“高原红色边防队”的光荣称号。
    海拔高革命斗志更高
    查果拉边防队是一九六一年成立的。这儿天寒地冻，严重缺氧，战士们刚到时高山反应厉害，头疼脚软，吃饭吃不下，睡觉睡不着。每天要从几里外背来冰块，融水做饭，气压低，沸点六十多度，不生就糊。气温低，烧开一锅水也得三个钟头。再加上没有房屋，住在帐篷和地窑里，风雪直往里灌，被子上常常积了很厚的雪。
    面对着一个又一个困难，党支部组织大家学习了毛主席在《关于重庆谈判》中的一段话：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……”战士们站在雪山顶上望着对面山口。当年，就是从这里，英帝国主义侵略军侵入了我国的西藏，使我们西藏的阶级兄弟长期受着封建农奴主和帝国主义的双重压迫。同志们听过翻身农奴对旧西藏人间地狱生活的血泪控诉。难道能让这种生活再来吗？我们不在这里设卡，谁在这里设卡！我们不来保卫，谁来保卫！指导员周文均又给大家讲红军过雪山的故事，和大家一起学习了毛主席语录：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”战士们说：革命前辈为人民敢上刀山下火海，我们为人民就能在雪山上站得住，扎下根！
    “一人辛苦，万人幸福！”“祖国人民的需要，就是革命战士的志愿！”这就是战士们的回答。
    空气稀薄吗？我们的政治空气浓厚。山峰海拔很高，我们革命的斗志更高！你看，战士们在岗位上，迎着卷着豆大石子的风雪，昂然屹立。夜里，被子上盖满了雪，战士们下岗回来，冻得不能睡，围住牛粪火，你一句我一句地写出了充满革命豪情的诗歌：
    安家在雪山，
    脚踏云雾间。
    沙石击面痛，
    风雪刺骨寒。
    心为人民乐，
    愿做艰苦伴。
    查果拉山依然是风雪严寒，空气稀薄，但是，查果拉山上高高树起了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。用毛泽东思想武装起来的边防队的同志们，准备征服一切困难。
    雪山安家作“愚公”
    有了在雪山上安家的决心，就要与天斗，与地斗，改变雪山上的环境。可是查果拉山没有建筑材料，甚至连水都很缺乏，有的只是冰雪和风化的石砾。怎样在这里修起工事，盖成营房呢？党支部认为，只要按毛主席的指示办事，什么都干得成。大家反复学习了《愚公移山》。战士们说，我们一定要当雪山上的新愚公，排除万难，改造自然面貌，建成边卡哨所。
    战士们下山十里，才找到了可以打坯的土，于是动手打坯。因天气太冷，寒风一吹，刚拌和好的泥就冻了一层冰，战士们脱去鞋袜，踩泥打坯。冰雹打在身上，汗水滴在泥里。这每一块土坯，都凝结着战士们的革命意志。
    背坯和抬石上山，更是困难。在这里，空着手走路也象挑着担子一样，使人气喘吁吁，何况是负重爬山呢。但是这些“雪山愚公”，偏要向雪山抖抖威风。他们人人争取多背多抬，终于把材料搬到了山上。不久，在这高高的雪山上，出现了第一排窑洞，第一幢宿舍，第一个食堂，第一个俱乐部，甚至还开辟出一个篮球场。
    在高山上最艰苦的是没有水吃。为了获得水源，战士们千辛万苦地寻踪辨迹，终于找到了一个拳头大的水窝，筷子粗的细流。他们劈山挖土，经过一次又一次的失败，最后胜利地修成了两个蓄水池。战士们说：查果拉，山再高，战士面前它弯腰，山似巨浪云似海，全在我们脚下踩；冰峰雪岭多苦寒，双手把它变乐园。
    上级十分关怀查果拉边防队战士的生活，给他们送来了发电机，送来了电灯，送来了温软的鸭绒被子，送来了水果罐头，等等。但是查果拉山上的战士不愿意事事都依赖上级，他们发扬了大寨精神，自己动手，靠山吃山，打猎养猪，保证了全队战士身强体壮。
    物质生活改善了，精神生活也要活跃起来。他们打球、唱歌，欢欢乐乐。每月还都要开个晚会，自编自演，又说又唱。五年来，开了六十九次晚会，演出了六百多个节目（自编的近三百个），大量地歌颂了本单位和外单位的好人好事，活跃了生活，激励了斗志。战士的雄壮声音，唱出了革命豪情：“革命战士心如火，歌声唱得雪溶河”。
    为了革命，必须增强体质。战士们经常组织打猎、背东西、打篮球等活动。几十里外本来可以用车辆运输的物资，他们争着去背回来。经过锻炼，大家的高山适应能力增强了，体重也普遍增加了。战士们得出这样的结论：“困难象弹簧，看你强不强，你强他就弱，你弱他就强。”
    放眼天下守河山
    初春，边防队第一次执行夜间潜伏的任务。他们静悄悄地卧在冰雪上和冻硬的土地上。寒风吹透了皮大衣、毛皮鞋。上半夜，战士们的体温暖化了冰雪冻土，下半夜，身子下面又变成了冻土冰霜了。严寒考验着战士，冻伤威胁着战士。
    潜伏回来，党支部领导战士们讨论怎样对待新的艰苦和困难，组织大家学习革命前辈的英雄事迹。长征中的红军，为什么能挨饿受冻爬过雪山、走过草地？在敌人监狱里的同志为什么不怕严刑拷打，威武不屈？黄继光、董存瑞、张映鑫在英勇牺牲前的一瞬间，难道不知道会粉身碎骨吗？战士们说，他们完全知道，可是，革命者的生命是属于人民的，当人民需要我们作出贡献的时候，就要挺身而出！经过热烈的讨论，战士们的勇气倍增，意志更强，大家争先恐后要求参加潜伏。他们夜夜送走星月，朝朝迎来彩霞。清晨归来，大家精神抖擞，高唱着：“边防军责任大……”。
    印度反动派在帝国主义和现代修正主义的纵容下，不断向我进行武装挑衅。查果拉边防队的战士们百倍警惕地坚守自己的岗位。他们肩上背着枪，衣袋里装着毛主席著作，一口雪一口干粮，在风雪中日夜巡逻，守卫祖国边防。一天晚上，巡逻队露宿在大雪山上，围着牛粪火，也感到寒气逼人。在这艰苦的时刻，战士胡同德从衣袋里掏出毛主席著作，给大家念一段：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这时，同志们好象亲自聆听着领袖的教导，好象毛主席就在身边，立刻感到无限温暖。
    他们在这样艰苦的条件下，坚持天天读毛主席的书。战士们遇到困难就学，有了问题就学，提出四不倒：没有文化难不倒，天寒地冻冷不倒，有了成绩夸不倒，工作再多挤不倒。起初，毛主席的书不够，大家都想学，怎么办？抄！把毛主席的书抄在本上，记在心上。战士们利用一切空隙时间抄书，一周的时间，在各种本子上，各种颜色和形状的纸上，抄下了毛主席的一百二十多篇文章。战士们说：一天不学毛主席著作，就象雪山中不见太阳，得不到温暖。我们一定要象王杰那样，学一点用一点，毛主席怎样说的，我们就怎样做。
    战士们站在查果拉，眼看亚非拉。他们用诗歌抒发自己的胸怀：“愿与雪山共百年，不念故乡景色鲜，红色哨卡英雄汉，放眼天下守河山。”
    革命熔炉炼新人
    几年来，查果拉边防队的战士们活学活用毛主席著作，迎着风雪严寒，战胜了艰苦困难；风雪严寒和艰苦困难又锻炼了边防队的战士们。他们的觉悟越来越高，斗志越来越强，查果拉成了一座锻炼无产阶级革命接班人的熔炉。
    请看用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士吧：
    边防队队长王成全，长期住在最高的山头上的地堡里，呼吸困难，常睡不好觉，但他坚持学习毛主席著作，常常读书到深夜。去年，他有了病，领导上要调他下查果拉，他坚决要求留下。他说，能干多少事就干多少事，重活干不了干轻活，在查果拉当炊事员也行。
    有一次，老战士张明全感冒了，可是他一声不吭，仍然坚持参加巡逻。在爬一个雪峰坚持不住的时候，他想到毛主席的话：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一鼓劲爬了上去。到驻地以后，干部劝他休息，他却悄悄地去帮助炊事班烧火，给电台摇发电机。他说：“革命就不能怕苦，怕苦就不能革命。”他深深体会到，在最困难的时候，有了毛主席的话作指示，任何困难就不在话下了。
    摇机员宁孝华，一手拿字典，一手拿毛主席著作，勤勤恳恳地学习，学一点，用一点。他在边防队工作了五年，五年没有离开过高寒山区，五年没有脱掉过棉衣，五年没有见过树木。和他同时入伍的同志有的当了干部，他现在还是一名摇机员。他说，“当干部，当战士，都是为人民服务，党要我干啥就干啥。我一摇马达，就使下情上报，上情下达，把雪山和北京联系起来，和世界革命斗争联系起来了！我的工作很有意义，我愿为革命摇一辈子发电机。”
    边防队五好战士标兵、副班长庞方伦，一次上岗时跌进了积雪盖平的战壕。他埋在雪里，爬呀爬呀，硬是坚持爬上了阵地。衣服内钻进了雪，刺骨的寒风又不断吹来，但是他坚定地站在岗位上。别人问他为什么能吃这么大的苦，他说：自己站一班岗，六亿人民就得到一刻安宁建设的时间，就支援了世界人民革命。
    几年来，有几十个同志因复员退伍，工作调动，离开了查果拉。但是个个都舍不得离开这个地方，许多人流着泪，依依而别。有的同志要求把自己的名字留在边防队的花名册上。他们都表示，一旦祖国需要，立即就上雪山。
    查果拉边防队的同志们，坚定地突出政治，认真地读毛主席的书，认真执行毛主席的指示，心里想着中国革命和世界革命，以苦为荣，以苦为乐，象一朵盛开的雪莲，高高地怒放在喜马拉雅山上。
