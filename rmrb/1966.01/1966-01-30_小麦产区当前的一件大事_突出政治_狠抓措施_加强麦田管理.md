    A Major Event in Wheat-Producing Areas
    Emphasize Politics, Vigorously Implement Measures, and Strengthen Wheat Field Management
    Relevant departments call on drought-stricken areas in the North to persist in the fight against drought, make every effort to expand the area of irrigated wheat, seize the opportunity for early spring watering and topdressing, and do a good job in preserving soil moisture.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th - Relevant departments told our reporter that managing overwintering wheat well, and ensuring that the wheat passes the greening stage successfully, is a major event for the broad masses of commune members and cadres in wheat-producing areas. All localities must use the concept of "one divides into two" to analyze the situation facing wheat field management, emphasize politics, grasp the main problems, mobilize the masses to take solid measures, and further improve the quality of wheat field management.
    The wheat overwintering period is coming to an end. How should the current and spring wheat field management be handled? Our reporter interviewed relevant departments on these issues.
    The information gathered by relevant departments shows that although many places in the North were dry and many places in the South were rainy during the autumn wheat sowing season last year, the climatic conditions were relatively poor. However, due to the emphasis on politics in various places, stressing the importance of increasing production in the summer, and starting preparations early and firmly, achieving the "five implementations" of thought, leadership, planning, measures, and labor force, the quality of wheat sowing was generally still good. After the sowing ended, various places promptly carried out field management. Therefore, wheat fields with relatively harmonious rainfall and irrigation conditions generally have good wheat growth. These wheat fields generally have sufficient seedlings and more tillers, laying a good foundation for striving for a bumper harvest.
    Relevant departments pointed out that the above situation is only one aspect. It must be seen that some of the wheat sowed in the North by drought-resistant methods and some of the late-sown cereal crops in the South are growing poorly due to rough sowing and insufficient base fertilizer. Drought in various parts of the North continues to develop, and in many places, soil moisture is insufficient. In addition, since the beginning of winter, temperatures have been higher, which is not only conducive to the overwintering of wheat pathogens and pests, but also causes some wheat to grow excessively. According to meteorological forecasts, there will still be less rain and snow in the North this spring, and spring drought is likely to occur. These are unfavorable factors affecting the development and growth of wheat. Therefore, all localities should take different measures according to different situations: areas with better wheat growth should further improve the quality of wheat field management, while drought-stricken areas should take various measures to combat drought and protect wheat.
    The key to doing a good job in wheat field management is to emphasize politics and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for farming for the revolution and increasing grain production for the revolution. Relevant departments said that in the socialist education movement, and in the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary consciousness of the broad masses has been further improved; in the movement to learn from Dazhai and emulate, catch up with, help and surpass each other, the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance has been further promoted, and the broad masses have sufficient revolutionary drive to strive for increased grain production in 1966. These are the decisive factors for doing a good job in wheat field management and fighting drought to protect wheat. All localities must seize this favorable factor, continue to emphasize politics, give full play to the strength and wisdom of the broad masses, overcome difficulties, overcome unfavorable factors, and do a good job in wheat field management.
    On the specific measures for wheat field management, relevant departments require that drought-stricken areas in the North should persist in the fight against drought, prevent and overcome the idea of relying on heaven for rain, try every means to expand the area of irrigated wheat, and do a good job in early spring watering. At the same time, adopt various measures to preserve soil moisture and seedlings, and promote the growth of wheat seedlings in accordance with local conditions and seedling conditions. Relevant departments believe that according to the experience of the masses over the years, timely rolling of wheat in early spring followed by measures such as hoeing, raking, and harrowing wheat can loosen the surface soil, which can not only preserve soil moisture but also keep it warm, which is conducive to promoting the development of wheat seedlings. Therefore, all localities should promote this measure according to local conditions. For the rice-wheat double-cropping areas in the South, relevant departments require that drainage and waterlogging prevention should be carried out to ensure increased wheat production. In these areas, in the current and spring wheat field management, on the one hand, efforts should be made to dredge the large ditches; on the other hand, combined with wheat field fertilization, the side ditches, waist ditches, and surrounding ditches in the field should be deepened to facilitate drainage.
    Relevant departments emphasized that early spring topdressing plays an important role in increasing effective wheat tillers and promoting large ears and full grains, and all localities should seize this work. In areas where rust is common and prone to occur, we must also do a good job in forecasting and reporting spring and winter rust, and preparing medicines and machinery, pay close attention to the occurrence and development of rust, and strengthen prevention and control.

    小麦产区当前的一件大事
    突出政治　狠抓措施　加强麦田管理
    有关部门要求北方干旱地区坚持抗旱斗争，千方百计扩大浇麦面积，抓紧早春浇水和追肥，做好保墒工作
    新华社二十九日讯　有关部门向本社记者说，当前管好越冬小麦，使小麦过好返青关，是小麦产区广大社员和干部的一件大事。各地必须运用一分为二的观点，分析麦田管理面临的形势，突出政治，抓住主要问题，发动群众采取扎扎实实的措施，进一步提高麦田管理的质量。
    小麦越冬期即将过去。当前和春季麦田管理应当怎样抓？本社记者就这些问题访问了有关部门。
    有关部门汇集的情况表明：去年秋冬小麦播种季节，虽然北方不少地方干旱，南方很多地方阴雨，气候条件较差，但是由于各地突出政治，强调夏季增产的重要性，准备工作抓得早、抓得紧，做到了思想、领导、计划、措施、劳力“五落实”，小麦播种质量一般仍然较好。播种结束以后，各地又及时展开田间管理。因此，雨水比较调和和有水浇条件的麦田，目前小麦一般生长良好。这些麦田一般苗数足，分蘖多，为争取丰收打下了良好的基础。
    有关部门指出，上述情况，只是一个方面。必须看到，北方各地一部分抗旱播种的小麦和南方一部分迟播的麦类作物，由于种得比较粗糙，加之底肥不足，目前长势较差。北方各地干旱仍在持续发展，许多地方墒情不足，加之入冬以来，气温较高，既有利于麦类作物的病菌和害虫越冬，又使一些小麦发生了旺长现象。据气象部门预测，今春北方雨雪仍然较少，又很可能发生春旱。这些，都是影响小麦发育、生长的不利因素。因此，各地应当分别不同情况，小麦生长较好的地区要进一步提高麦田管理的质量，干旱地区要采取多种措施抗旱保麦。
    搞好麦田管理的关键，是突出政治，调动广大群众为革命种田、为革命增产粮食的积极性。有关部门说，在社会主义教育运动中，在群众性的学习毛主席著作的活动中，广大群众的革命觉悟有了进一步的提高；在以大寨为榜样的比学赶帮超运动中，艰苦奋斗，自力更生的革命精神，得到了进一步的发扬，广大群众争取一九六六年粮食增产的革命干劲很足。这些，是搞好麦田管理和抗旱保麦的决定性因素。各地必须抓住这个有利因素，继续突出政治，充分发挥广大群众的力量和智慧，战胜困难，克服不利因素，把麦田管理搞好。
    在麦田管理的具体措施上，有关部门要求，北方干旱地区，要坚持抗旱斗争，防止和克服靠天等雨的思想，千方百计地扩大浇麦面积，抓好早春浇水。同时因地、因苗制宜，采取各种措施进行保墒、保苗，促进麦苗生长。有关部门认为，根据群众多年经验，早春及时压麦以后随即采取锄麦、搂麦、耙麦等措施，能使地表疏松，不仅能够保墒，又能够保温，有利于促进麦苗发育。因此，各地对于这项措施，要因地制宜地加以推行。对于南方稻麦两熟地区，有关部门要求，要作好除涝防渍工作，以保证麦类作物增产。这些地区，在当前和春季麦田管理中，一方面要下力量挖通大沟；一方面要结合麦田施肥，加深田间的厢沟、腰沟、围沟，以利于排水。
    有关部门强调指出，早春追肥对增加小麦有效分蘖，促进穗大粒多，有重大作用，各地应该抓紧这一工作。在锈病常发、易发地区还要作好春冬锈病的测报和药械准备工作，密切注意锈病发生发展情况，加强防治。
