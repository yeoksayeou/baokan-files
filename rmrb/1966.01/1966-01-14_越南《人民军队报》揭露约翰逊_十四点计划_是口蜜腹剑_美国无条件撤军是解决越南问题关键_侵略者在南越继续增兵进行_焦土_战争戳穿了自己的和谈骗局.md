    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 13th -- Vietnam's *People's Army Newspaper* published an observer article on the 12th, pointing out that the so-called fourteen-point proposal of "seeking peace" peddled by the Johnson administration is a great swindle and a great conspiracy. The article said that the most important key to solving the South Vietnam problem is that the United States must unconditionally withdraw its expeditionary forces from South Vietnam.

    The article, entitled "The Truth About the Fourteen Points of the American 'Basket of Peace'," stated that the more the Johnson government engages in new tricks, the more it exposes that the American viewpoint and attitude remain the same as before.

    The article systematically refuted the absurd arguments of the fourteen American points. The article pointed out that the United States, clearly sending expeditionary forces across thousands of miles to invade Vietnam, is reversing black and white by calling the Vietnamese people aggressors and slandering North Vietnam, attempting to justify its crimes of aggression against Vietnam. The article also refuted the absurd argument of the U.S. government that the United States "has the right" to invade South Vietnam because the United States must abide by the promises it made to the Saigon puppet regime. The article said that this is actually just a promise made by the United States itself to reserve the right to the United States to violate the Geneva Accords.

    The article emphasized that the fourteen American points, since they proceed from its position of aggression, can only be a concrete manifestation of its aggressive position, no matter how sweetly it talks.

    The article said that the United States has consistently refused to recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the Southern people, and opposes its program. This shows that the United States has consistently adhered to its policy of aggression, adhered to its destruction of the Geneva Accords, and stubbornly and blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of the South Vietnamese people. When will the United States not recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, not recognize the Front's program, then the U.S.'s so-called "sincerity" in peacefully resolving the Vietnam problem is just empty and worthless words.

    The article, in refuting the American fallacy of talking about withdrawing troops only after peace is guaranteed, said that this is not a question of whether the United States agrees or disagrees, wants to or does not want to, but a question of the United States must guarantee respect for the Vietnamese people's right to self-determination, and embody this guarantee with actions, stop aggression, and withdraw troops. The article pointed out that the American argument means: the United States will not withdraw its troops.

    In talking about the American proposal to solve the Vietnam problem by "taking the Geneva Accords as the basis," the article pointed out that the United States is talking about the Geneva Accords in order to more blatantly violate the Geneva Accords. Since the United States proposed "taking the Geneva Accords as the basis," then why talk about "unconditional discussions"? Why not recognize the four-point proposition of the Vietnamese government, which embodies the main political and military provisions of the Geneva Accords? Obviously, the so-called "unconditional discussion" is to enable U.S. imperialism to have the "unconditional" "right" to violate the Geneva Accords, in order to "unconditionally" invade South Vietnam, and to demand that the Vietnamese people "unconditionally" submit to U.S. imperialism.

    The article, in exposing the American conspiracy of "ceasing hostile actions will be an appropriate primary issue for any negotiation or discussion," pointed out that this is for the United States to buy time, re-consolidate the puppet regime, increase American and accomplice troops, and prepare forces to further expand the war of aggression.

    The article also refuted the American absurdity that "Hanoi's four-point proposition can be discussed together with other propositions that others may wish to make." The article said that the American so-called "other propositions," to put it bluntly, are to discuss the American fourteen points. These American propositions are to deny the four-point proposition of the Vietnamese people. Obviously, the United States wants to confuse the issues and undermine the correct basis for solving the Vietnam problem.

    The article then sternly condemned the U.S. imperialist's so-called "suspension of bombing of North Vietnam," this blatant blackmail. The article said that the United States trumpets "suspending bombing" as its "sincerity," which is utter gangster logic. The United States' using air force to attack a socialist Vietnam with independence and sovereignty is a serious crime of U.S. imperialism. Over the past year, this crime has been strongly condemned by the people of the world. The article said that the United States must unconditionally and permanently stop this evil act. Recently, American aircraft have continuously intruded into the airspace of the North for reconnaissance, which is obviously preparing for their renewed launching of bandit attacks. This trick of the United States cannot deceive anyone and cannot paralyze the vigilance of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

    The observer article pointed out that just as Washington is vigorously peddling the fourteen points and goods such as "seeking peace," it is also the time when U.S. imperialism is frantically intensifying its war of aggression in South Vietnam. It continues to increase troops in the South and conduct a "scorched earth" war. In Laos, the United States is wantonly dispatching air force to indiscriminately bomb. Obviously, these crazy war actions expose that the American so-called "sincerely seeking peace" is purely a hoax, in order to cover up the American conspiracy to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The article concluded by saying that the American so-called "basket of peace" with its fourteen points and its brutal war actions have exposed the aggressive nature, stubbornness, and deceptive hypocrisy of the Johnson group to the world.

    越南《人民军队报》揭露约翰逊“十四点计划”是口蜜腹剑
    美国无条件撤军是解决越南问题关键
    侵略者在南越继续增兵进行“焦土”战争戳穿了自己的和谈骗局
    新华社河内十三日电　越南《人民军队报》十二日发表一篇观察家文章指出，约翰逊政府推销的所谓“寻求和平”的十四点主张是一个大骗局、大阴谋。文章说，解决越南南方问题的最主要关键在于美国必须无条件地把它的远征军撤出越南南方。
    这篇题为《美国“和平的篮子”的十四点主张的真相》的文章说，约翰逊政府越搞花样翻新，越是暴露出美国的观点和态度仍是依然故我。
    文章系统地驳斥了美国十四点主张的荒谬论调。文章指出，美国明明派远征军横渡万里重洋来侵略越南，却颠倒黑白地把越南人民说成是侵略者，污蔑越南北方，企图为自己侵略越南的罪行辩护。文章还驳斥了美国政府扬言，美国“有权”侵略越南南方是由于美国要遵守对西贡傀儡集团所许下的诺言的荒谬论调。文章说，这实际上只是美国自己许下的诺言，以保留美国破坏日内瓦协议的权利。
    文章强调指出，美国的十四点主张由于是从它的侵略立场出发，因此，不管它谈得多么甜蜜，这只能是它的侵略立场的具体表现。
    文章说，美国一贯不承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南方人民唯一的真正代表，反对它的纲领，这就表明美国一贯坚持侵略政策，坚持破坏日内瓦协议，并顽固地、明目张胆地干涉越南南方人民的内部事务。什么时候美国还不承认南方民族解放阵线、不承认阵线的纲领，那么，美国所谓和平解决越南问题的“诚意”只不过是空洞的毫无价值的词句而已。
    文章在驳斥美国侈谈要在和平获得保证以后才撤军的论调时说，这不是美国赞成不赞成、愿意不愿意的问题，而是美国必须保证尊重越南人民的自决权，并以行动体现这个保证，停止侵略和撤军的问题。文章指出，美国的这个论调意味着：美国不撤军。
    文章在谈到美国提出解决越南问题可以以“日内瓦协议作为基础”的问题时指出，美国谈到日内瓦协议是为了更加明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议。美国既然提出“以日内瓦协议作为基础”，那为什么还要谈到“无条件讨论”呢？为什么不承认集中体现了日内瓦协议主要政治和军事条款的越南政府的四项主张呢？很显然，所谓“无条件讨论”就是使美帝国主义拥有“无条件”破坏日内瓦协议的“权利”，以便“无条件”地侵略越南南方，要越南人民“无条件”地向美帝国主义屈服。
    文章在揭露美国所谓“停止敌对行动将是任何谈判或讨论的适当的首要问题”的阴谋时指出，这是美国为了取得时间，重新巩固伪政权、增派美军和帮凶军，准备力量以便进一步扩大侵略战争。
    文章还驳斥了美国所说的“河内的四项主张是可以同他人可能希望提出的其它主张一起讨论”的荒谬论调。文章说，美国所谓“其它主张”，说穿了就是讨论美国的十四点主张。美国这些主张是为了否认越南人民的四项主张。很显然，美国想把问题混为一谈，破坏解决越南问题的正确基础。
    文章接着严厉谴责美帝国主义所谓“暂停对越南北方的轰炸”这个明目张胆的讹诈。文章说，美国把“暂停轰炸”作为它的“诚意”大吹大擂，是十足的强盗论调。美国用空军袭击一个拥有独立、主权的社会主义越南，是美帝国主义的严重罪行。一年来，这个罪行遭到了全世界人民的强烈谴责。文章说，美国必须无条件地永远地停止这一罪恶行动。最近，美国飞机不断侵入北方领空进行侦察，这显然是为它们再次发动强盗袭击作准备。美国这一手段是骗不了任何人的，是不能麻痹越南人民和世界人民的警惕性的。
    观察家文章指出，正当华盛顿大肆兜售十四点主张和“寻求和平”等货色时，也正是美帝国主义疯狂地强化在越南南方的侵略战争的时候。它在南方继续增兵，进行“焦土”战争。在老挝，美国大肆出动空军滥施轰炸。很显然，这些疯狂的战争行动暴露了美国所谓“真心寻求和平”纯粹是一场骗局，是为了掩盖美国进一步扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋。
    文章最后说，美国所谓“和平篮子”里的十四点主张以及它的残暴战争行动，使约翰逊集团的侵略成性、顽固和欺骗的虚伪面目真相大白于天下。
