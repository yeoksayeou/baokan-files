    Facing the countryside and serving the peasants, art should first and foremost popularize things that the peasants need and can easily accept. Single New Year pictures are universally needed by the peasants; decorative New Year pictures adapted to local customs are even more welcomed by the peasants. In Shanxi province, these New Year pictures include door decorations, hanging scrolls, screen paintings, and dust-brush paper in the Jinnan area, and paper cuttings, window decorations, kang (platform bed) surround paintings, and灶头画 (zaotouhua, kitchen stove paintings) in the Jinbei area. Due to the different customs and habits of various places, the forms and styles of these decorative New Year pictures also vary. For example, there is a big difference between door paintings for double-leaf doors and single-leaf doors, and square paintings. This requires our art workers to go deep among the masses and master all the forms that the peasants like.
    In recent years, in order to enable socialist art to occupy the position in the countryside, art workers from all over Shanxi and rural amateur art lovers have worked together to innovate and draw a large number of decorative art works that are urgently needed by the countryside. In the Jinnan area alone, since 1962, as many as 4.5 million copies of such works have been supplied to the countryside. At the same time, art workers throughout the province have also continuously held art exhibitions, shown art slides, painted murals and village history paintings in the countryside, and done a lot of art work directly serving the countryside. This is of great benefit to further serving the peasants better.

    面向农村  为农民服务
    苏光
    美术面向农村，为农民服务，首先要向农民普及他们自己所需要、所易于接受的东西。单幅年画是普遍为农民所需要的；适应各地风俗的装饰性年画，更为农民所欢迎。这些年画，就山西地区来说，有晋南一带的门头、挂笺、影壁画、拂尘纸和晋北一带的剪纸、窗花、炕围画、灶头画。由于各地民情风俗的不同，这些装饰性年画的形式、风格也各有差异。如对扇门和单扇门的门画、斗方就相差很大。这就要求我们美术工作者，深入群众，掌握一切为农民所喜欢的形式。
    近几年来，为了使社会主义的美术在农村占领阵地，山西各地的美术工作者和农村业余美术爱好者一起，大量革新和绘制了为农村所迫切需要的装饰美术作品；仅晋南一地，从一九六二年以来，就供应了农村这类作品达四百五十万份之多。与此同时，全省美术工作者，还不断在农村举办美术展览会、放映美术幻灯片、绘制壁画和村史画等，作了许多直接为农村服务的美术工作。这对进一步更好地为农民服务是大有益处的。
