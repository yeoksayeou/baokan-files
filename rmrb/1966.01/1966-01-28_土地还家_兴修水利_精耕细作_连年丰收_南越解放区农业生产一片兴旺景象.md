    HANOI, Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the peasants in the South Vietnam liberated areas have been allocated land, their enthusiasm for production is high, and they have achieved great success in developing agricultural production.
    According to incomplete statistics, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front has distributed more than two million hectares of land to peasants who are landless or have little land. In addition, the National Liberation Front has implemented the policy of rent and interest reduction. In the southern liberated areas alone, peasants have reduced rents totaling 200,000 tons of grain.
    After the peasants obtained land, the National Liberation Front encouraged and led the people of the liberated areas to voluntarily take the road of collective production and establish work exchange teams and mutual aid teams. As of October 1965, in the central Trung Bo region (excluding Thừa Thiên and Quảng Nam provinces), farmers had established more than 4,500 work exchange teams, with more than 83,000 participants. Tens of thousands of work exchange teams have also been established in the southern plains.
    After obtaining land, the peasants in the liberated areas have displayed high enthusiasm for production. They have actively built water conservancy projects, engaged in deep plowing, replanting, and increased yields per unit area. According to statistics, from 1962 to July 1964, the peasants in the liberated areas had dug 1,400 kilometers of canals and built 5,000 large and small sluice gates. Due to the vigorous construction of water conservancy projects, the area of rice cultivation has increased. In 1964, the area of rice cultivation in Bến Tre province increased by two times compared with 1963, and the output increased by three times, while the area of miscellaneous grain cultivation increased by nine times. In the past, southern farmers were accustomed to planting only one crop, but now many places are planting two crops, and yields have also increased significantly. In some provinces in the Tây Nguyên and central Trung Bo region, grain production in 1965 increased by nearly one and a half times compared with 1962, and cassava production increased by nearly six times.

    土地还家　兴修水利　精耕细作　连年丰收
    南越解放区农业生产一片兴旺景象
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下，越南南方解放区农民分到了土地，生产热情高涨，在发展农业生产中取得很大成绩。
    据不完全统计，越南南方民族解放阵线已经把二百多万公顷的土地，分配给无地、少地的农民，此外，民族解放阵线还贯彻了减租减息政策。仅南部解放区各省农民减租总数就达二十万吨谷物。
    在农民分得土地后，民族解放阵线鼓励和领导解放区人民自愿走集体生产的道路，成立变工组、互助组。截至一九六五年十月止，在中部中区（承天和广南省未计算在内），农民们已经成立了四千五百多个变工组，参加人数达八万三千多人。在南部平原地区也成立了成万个变工组。
    解放区农民分得土地后，生产热情高涨。他们积极兴修水利，深耕、复种和提高单位面积产量。据统计，从一九六二年起到一九六四年七月止，解放区农民已挖掘了一千四百公里长的水渠，修筑了五千个大小水闸。由于大力兴修水利，水稻种植面积有了增加。槟椥省一九六四年的水稻种植面积比一九六三年增加了两倍，产量增加了三倍，杂粮种植面积增加了九倍。过去，南部农民习惯只种植一造，现在许多地方已种植两造，产量也有了明显提高。西原和中部中区的一些省分，一九六五年同一九六二年比较，稻谷增产近一倍半，木薯增产将近六倍。
