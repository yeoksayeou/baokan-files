    Regarding a well group in the Sixth Team of the Fourth Mining Area of Daqing Oilfield, two manhole covers urgently needed welding repair. However, there was no vehicle available to transport them. Oil workers Wen Dongsheng and Wang Genhe immediately found a carrying pole and carried the manhole covers to the repair team. They had walked less than 300 meters when the two manhole covers, each weighing over 200 jin, broke the carrying pole. The team leader asked them to wait and send two more people to help carry them. They said, "How can revolution wait!" So, one person carried one manhole cover on his back, and they walked more than five *li*, delivering them to the repair team.
    Doing revolution should not be sloppy and slow, but should be swift and efficient, seizing every minute and second. This is the fighting style that the working class should have. It represents extreme responsibility for one's work and extreme enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause. The resounding words "How can revolution wait!" spoken by these two oil workers are a profound embodiment of the working class's fighting style.

    干革命不能等待
    大庆采油四矿六队的一个井组，有两个人孔盖子急需焊修。可是，却没有车来拉运。采油工文东升与王根和，当即找了一根扁担，把人孔盖抬到维修队去修理。走了不到三百米，这两个二百来斤重的人孔盖，就把扁担压断了。队长叫他们等一等，再派两个人来帮助抬。他们说：“干革命怎能等待！”于是一人背一个人孔盖，走了五里多路，送到了维修队。
    干革命，本来就不应该松松垮垮，慢慢吞吞，而应该雷厉风行，分秒必争，这是工人阶级应有的战斗作风。这表示对自己工作的极端负责和对革命事业的极端热忱。这两个采油工所说的“干革命怎能等待”这样响当当的语言，正是工人阶级战斗作风的深刻体现。
