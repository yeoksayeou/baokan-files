    Johnson Helpless and Very Discouraged
    For more than four months since the end of August last year, US President Johnson has rarely appeared in public and has rarely given public speeches. Why does this veteran politician, who is always accustomed to grandstanding, appear depressed? The answer obtained by "U.S. News & World Report" is that the war in South Vietnam, which is "about to be lost," has left him "helpless" and "very discouraged." Therefore, the image of this US president appears crestfallen.
    The image of Lyndon Johnson that this country (the United States) has gained in recent months is a changed image—the image of a president who is not very confident in himself.
    From the end of August 1965 to the New Year, only one formal press conference was held in more than four months. Meetings to provide background information to reporters have also been reduced. It seems that he is no longer so concerned about shaping an extremely active image.
    On October 8, the President underwent gallbladder surgery. On January 4, he returned to the White House to resume normal work, a total of nearly three months in between.
    Mr. Johnson rarely appeared on television during this time. Compared with before his illness, his personal contact with the government staff closely controlled by the White House has also been greatly reduced.
    People began to ask questions. What happened to the president? Is he still a patient? What happened in Washington? Why doesn't the president explain more about what the Vietnam War is all about?
    According to the President's doctors, the President's health is excellent. So why has he looked somewhat crestfallen for a long time? The answer to this question seems to be that an endless war has left the president helpless, and he has been trying to think deeply about this issue and other issues that are making him increasingly distressed.
    An experienced observer pointed out: "The Vietnam War issue has made Mr. Johnson very discouraged. He is pained by the unpopular decisions that must be made... What also makes him uneasy is that the world is slow to understand and recognize the United States' position in the war, that is to say, the allies are slow to provide the help that should be provided."
    The war that President Johnson inherited was about to be lost. Therefore, it is necessary to drastically accelerate conscription, and more and more American troops are transported from 8,000 miles away across the Pacific to Vietnam... Now the talk is not about tax cuts, but about tax increases. Expanding the war began to overstimulate the economy, creating pressure that caused prices to rise. Rising living costs began to annoy many housewives.
    More and more columnists are becoming very opinionated. In Congress, there is also a great divergence of opinion within the president's own party.
    The result is: the president is forced to make all kinds of difficult decisions. A veteran senator—a prominent Democrat—said something like this: "Johnson's thought process is this: he asks himself, if we cut (the funding for) the Great Society (program), will this win votes? Obviously, the answer to this question is: no. If we send more and more troops to Vietnam, will this strengthen my popularity and my image? The answer is still: no. If we further escalate the war step by step, will this strengthen my image in the world? The answer is still: no."
    A Republican leader described the President's changed image this way: President Johnson is in a dilemma.

### 约翰逊一筹莫展十分沮丧

专栏：外论摘要

    约翰逊一筹莫展十分沮丧
    从去年八月底以来的四个多月内，美国总统约翰逊很少出头露面，也很少公开讲话。这个一向惯于哗众取宠的老牌政客为什么显得萎靡不振呢？《美国新闻与世界报道》得到的答案是：美国在南越进行的一场“快要输掉”的战争使他“一筹莫展”，“十分沮丧”，因此，这个美国总统的形象显得灰溜溜的了。
    最近几个月以来，这个国家（美国）所获得的林登·约翰逊形象，是一个改变了的形象——一个对自己不怎么有信心的总统的形象。
    从一九六五年八月底到新年的四个多月里，只举行过一次正式的记者招待会。向记者提供背景情况的会议也减少了。看来似乎不再那么关心塑造一个极其活跃的风姿。
    十月八日总统动了胆囊手术。一月四日他回到白宫恢复正常工作，中间共有近三个月的时间。
    约翰逊先生在这段时间内很少在电视上出现。与生病前比较起来，他与受白宫密切控制的政府工作人员的个人接触也大为减少。
    人们开始提出问题。总统发生了什么事情？他仍旧是一个病人吗？华盛顿出了什么事？为什么总统不对越南战争究竟是什么一回事作更多的解释呢？
    照总统的医生看来，总统的健康是极好的。那么为什么长时期里看来有些灰溜溜呢？这个问题的答案似乎是，一场没有结束的战争使总统一筹莫展，他一直试图深入思考这个问题和其他一些使他越来越苦恼的问题。
    一个有经验的观察家指出：“越南战争的问题使约翰逊先生十分沮丧。他对必须作出的不得人心的决定感到痛苦……使他不安的还有，世界在了解和认识美国在战争中的地位方面很迟缓，也就是说，盟国在提供应当提供的帮助方面很迟缓。”
    约翰逊总统继承的战争快要输掉了。因此必须急剧加快征兵，愈来愈多的美军从八千英里以外越过太平洋赶运到越南去……现在谈论的不是减税，而是加税了。扩大战争开始过度刺激经济，形成了使物价上涨的压力。上升的生活费用开始使许多家庭主妇恼火。
    愈来愈多的专栏作家变得意见很多。在国会里，总统自己的政党内部也有很大的分歧意见。
    结果是：总统被迫作出种种困难的决定。一个老资格的参议员——一位重要的民主党人讲过这样的话：“约翰逊的思想进程是这样的：他自己问自己，要是我们削减（建设）伟大社会（的经费），这会获得选票吗？显然对这问题的回答是：不能。要是向越南派去越来越多的军队，这会加强我的人望和我的形象吗？回答仍然是：不能。要是进一步使战争逐步升级，这会加强我在世界上的形象吗？回答仍然是：不能。”
    一位共和党领导人这样描述总统的改变了的形象：约翰逊总统是处在进退两难的境地。
