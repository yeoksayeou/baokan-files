    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 26th: According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the military and civilians of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area in South Vietnam recently annihilated 1,318 enemy troops, including 1,289 US aggressor troops killed or wounded, in a twelve-day battle in Cu Chi district, repelling a large-scale "mopping-up" operation by the US invading forces and their puppets.

    The military and civilians of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area were recently awarded the First-Class Bronze Wall Medal by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

    On the 21st, the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military Region issued a communique on the course of the battle, which began on January 8th.

    The communique stated that in order to lift the encirclement and threat posed to their nest—Saigon—by the military and civilians of this area, and at the same time to destroy the local people's economy, the American robbers mobilized 8,000 troops, including the US 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 2nd and 3rd Brigades under the 1st Infantry Division, a battalion of Australian accomplice troops (not counting the two puppet regiments stationed on the periphery), two US artillery battalions, two US tank armored regiments, and 600 military vehicles and 200 aircraft of various types, to conduct a "mopping-up" operation in the northern part of Cu Chi district in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area. The communique said that although the American robbers had a large number of troops and deployed many aircraft and artillery for cover, they only dared to launch "mopping-up" operations against the six villages of Phu My Hung, Phu An, Dong An Nhan, Tay An Nhan, Nhuan Duc, and Duc Hiep, which are close to their strongholds and located north and south of Highway 1. To pave the way for this large-scale "mopping-up" operation, they used aircraft and artillery to carry out continuous round-the-clock bombing of this area for twenty days before the "mopping-up" operation.

    At six o'clock in the morning on January 8th, the US invading forces and Australian accomplice troops began to attack the above-mentioned villages, implementing a policy of "burn all, kill all, destroy all" against these villages. During this "mopping-up" operation, the American robbers massacred more than 100 civilians, most of whom were women and children; they sprayed poisonous gas into the civilians' air-raid shelters; burned 1,500 houses and 10,000 piculs of grain; killed 200 head of cattle and thousands of domestic animals; and destroyed all the utensils they saw.

    The military and civilians in the northern part of Cu Chi district, adhering to the determination to defend the liberated area and carrying forward the tradition of heroic resistance, gave the American robbers a head-on blow. The Cu Chi military and civilians cooperated very closely in the battle to repel the enemy's "mopping-up" operation. While the guerrillas constantly intercepted the enemy, the Liberation Armed Forces ambushed the enemy from behind.

    According to statistics, in the twelve-day counter-"mopping-up" battle, the military and civilians of Cu Chi district fought more than 200 times, annihilating 1,318 enemy troops, including 1,076 US troops killed and 213 US troops wounded; destroying or damaging 48 enemy military vehicles of various types, one 105mm howitzer and one 106mm mortar, eight 81mm mortars, and shooting down 29 enemy aircraft (mostly helicopters), and damaging 50. In addition, the military and civilians of Cu Chi district also captured many American soldiers and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

    The communique said that in this counter-"mopping-up" battle, the guerrillas performed very heroically, using simple weapons to annihilate a large amount of the enemy's strength, and many groups and individuals achieved outstanding results.

    The communique pointed out that this is an extremely great and brilliant victory achieved by the military and civilians of Cu Chi district at the beginning of this year. In this counter-"mopping-up" battle, the military and civilians of Cu Chi district have not only shattered the enemy's conspiracy to lift the increasingly tight encirclement of their nest—Saigon—by the Liberation Armed Forces, but also annihilated part of the US military's strength. It can be said with certainty that no matter how many troops the enemy has, how many weapons they have, and how modernized they are, they cannot defeat the military and civilians of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area. The reason is very simple, because the morale of the US military is very low.

    The communique said that the above-mentioned achievements eloquently demonstrate that the Saigon-Gia Dinh area and the Cu Chi military and civilians have sufficient ability and determination to defeat the American robbers, and they are worthy of the First-Class Bronze Wall Medal recently awarded by the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

    The communique finally encouraged the military and civilians of Cu Chi district not to be subjectively complacent after achieving this victory, but to prepare more actively and thoroughly in all aspects, resolutely build and consolidate the liberated areas, and be ready to give the US invading forces thunderous blows at any time.

    粉碎美军大规模“扫荡”　加强对西贡的紧密包围
    南越解放军古芝大捷歼灭美军千余
    美国强盗在“扫荡”中实行“三光”政策终于遭到了应得的惩罚
    新华社河内二十六日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡—嘉定地区军民最近在古芝县反击美国侵略军及其仆从的大规模“扫荡”的十二天战斗中，一举歼敌一千三百十八名，其中打死、打伤美国侵略军一千二百八十九名。
    西贡—嘉定地区军民最近曾荣获越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团授予的一级铜墙勋章。
    二十一日，西贡—嘉定军区解放武装力量指挥部就这次从一月八日开始的战斗的经过，发表了公报。
    公报说，美国强盗为了解除这个地区的军民对他们的巢穴——西贡的包围和威胁，同时破坏当地人民的经济，出动了八千名军队，其中有美国第一七三伞兵旅、第一步兵师属下的第二旅和第三旅、一营澳大利亚帮凶军（驻在外围的两团伪军还没有计算在内）、两个美军炮兵营、两个美军坦克装甲团以及六百辆军车和二百架各种类型的飞机，对西贡—嘉定地区的古芝县北面进行“扫荡”。公报说，尽管美国强盗的军队人数多，又出动许多飞机和大炮加以掩护，但是他们只敢向靠近他们据点的、位于第一号公路北面和南面的富美兴、富安、东安仁、西安仁、润德、德协六个乡发动“扫荡”。为了给这次大规模“扫荡”开路，他们在“扫荡”前就用飞机和大炮向这个地区进行了连续二十天的狂轰滥炸。
    一月八日早上六时，美国侵略军和澳大利亚帮凶军开始进攻上述各乡，对这些乡实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”的政策。在这次“扫荡”中，美国强盗残杀了一百多名群众，其中大部分是妇女和儿童；他们向群众的防空洞喷射毒气；烧毁了一千五百间房屋和一万斗谷子；杀死二百头牛和成千头家畜；毁坏了所有被它们看到的用具。
    古芝县北部地区军民本着保卫解放区的决心，发扬英勇不屈的传统，给予美国强盗以迎头痛击。古芝军民在反击敌人“扫荡”的战斗中配合得非常紧密，当游击队不断阻击敌人的时候，解放武装力量则从背后截击敌人。
    据统计，在十二天的反“扫荡”战斗中，古芝县军民共作战二百多次，歼灭敌人一千三百一十八名，其中，打死美军一千零七十六名，打伤美军二百一十三名；击毁击伤敌人各种军用车四十八辆、一零五毫米榴弹炮和一零六毫米迫击炮各一门、八十一毫米迫击炮八门，击落敌机二十九架（大部分是直升飞机），击伤五十架。此外，古芝县军民还俘虏了不少美国兵，缴获大量武器和军用物资。
    公报说，在这次反“扫荡”战斗中，游击队表现得非常英勇，他们用简陋的武器大量歼灭敌人的有生力量，许多小组和个人创造了出色的成绩。
    公报指出，这是古芝县军民在今年年初所取得的极其巨大和辉煌的胜利。在这次反“扫荡”战斗中，古芝县军民不仅已经粉碎了敌人妄图解除解放武装力量对他们的巢穴——西贡周围的日益紧密的包围的阴谋，而且还歼灭了美军的一部分有生力量。可以肯定地说，不管敌人的兵力再多，武器再多和怎样现代化，也是不能战胜西贡—嘉定地区军民的。理由很简单，因为美军的士气非常低落。
    公报说，上述的战绩雄辩地说明了西贡—嘉定地区和古芝军民是具有足够的能力和决心战胜美国强盗的，他们无愧于越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会最近授予的一级铜墙勋章。
    公报最后勉励古芝县军民在取得这个胜利后，不主观自满，更加积极和完善地做好各方面的准备，坚决建设和巩固解放区，随时准备给美国侵略军以雷霆般的打击。（附图片）
