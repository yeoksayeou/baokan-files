    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Khang Khay on the 19th: Radio Pathet Lao broadcast a statement on the 18th by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, pointing out that the "peace offensive" recently launched by the U.S. government is more insidious than any previous one.

    The statement said that the true purpose of the United States is not only to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam, but also to expand the war in Vietnam to the entire Indochina.

    The statement said that facts over the past year have shown that when the United States talks glibly about "peace," it is precisely when it transports more American aggressor troops and killing instruments to South Vietnam, expands the war of aggression against South Vietnam, and "escalates" the bombing of North Vietnam.

    The statement said that the United States is preparing to double the total number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam, and the 3rd Brigade of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division has recently arrived in Pleiku. The United States and its puppet troops also use chemical poisons and toxic gases to massacre the people of South Vietnam on a large scale, carrying out a "kill all, burn all, destroy all" war in South Vietnam.

    Towards North Vietnam, the United States, on the one hand, plays the trick of so-called "bombing pause," while on the other hand, it repeatedly sends aircraft to North Vietnam for reconnaissance, preparing to commit new crimes.

    While the U.S. Air Force is massively bombing the Laotian liberated areas, the United States is also concentrating large numbers of Lao right-wing troops and Thai troops, under the coordination of U.S. aircraft, to launch large-scale offensives against the central and lower Laos regions, attempting to occupy this area and use it as a springboard for expanding the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula.

    These war-expanding actions of the United States have exposed its false "peace" smokescreen and revealed the extremely ugly murderous face of U.S. imperialism. Although the United States clamors for "peace," every word of its "peace" carries a bloody smell. The statement said that as long as U.S. imperialism withdraws all its military personnel, troops, weapons, and instruments of war from South Vietnam and Laos, and ceases all war actions against Indochina, peace can be restored immediately.

    The statement said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front supports the four-point proposition and five-point statement of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on resolving the Vietnam issue; it reiterates that the four-point statement and five measures elaborated in the declaration of the Lao National Political Consultative Conference are the only basis for resolving the Laos issue.

    The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to immediately stop playing "peace" tricks and cease all actions to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina. Otherwise, the united Lao people, Vietnamese people, and Cambodian people will eliminate them.

    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 19th: Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said on the 18th that while U.S. imperialism is talking glibly about so-called peaceful aspirations, it is preparing to "gradually escalate" the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    Chairman Nosaka made this speech at a lecture organized by the JCP in Tokyo. More than a thousand people listened to his lecture.

    Chairman Nosaka listed evidence of the U.S. attempt to gradually escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam, saying that the United States plans to send another 200,000 troops to South Vietnam; the U.S. federal budget has increased military spending, and Japan has in fact been turned into a U.S. nuclear war base.

    Chairman Nosaka emphasized that despite this, the United States can never win in Vietnam. He said: "The United States has fallen into a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. The more desperately it struggles, the deeper it digs its own grave."

    Chairman Nosaka then condemned the Japanese Sato government for actively cooperating with the United States, implementing the U.S.'s two-faced policy, and attempting to drag the Japanese people into the war.

    Chairman Nosaka said that although the situation is tense, the democratic forces have been advancing by leaps and bounds, especially the Communist Party has made great progress. Therefore, the democratic forces will achieve brilliant achievements in the new year.

    Chairman Sanzo Nosaka spoke about the main tasks facing the Japanese people this year: supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people; defending the people's lives; defending democracy and smashing the Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to implement a small constituency system.

    老挝爱国战线党谴责美帝阴谋扩大印度支那战争
    印度支那人民团结起来消灭美国强盗
    日共主席野坂谴责美国侈谈和平扩大战争
    据新华社康开十九日电  据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十八日发表声明指出，美国政府最近发动的“和平攻势”比过去任何一次都更加阴险。
    声明说，美国的真正目的不仅是要强化侵略越南的战争，而且是要把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那。
    声明说，近一年来的事实表明，在美国侈谈“和平”的时候，也就是它把更多美国侵略军和杀人工具运到越南南方、扩大对越南南方的侵略战争和对越南北方的轰炸进行“升级”的时候。
    声明说，美国准备把在越南南方的美军总数增加一倍，美国第二十五步兵师第三旅最近也开到了波来古。美国及其走狗军队还用化学毒药和毒气大规模地屠杀越南南方人民，在越南南方进行“杀光、烧光、毁光”的战争。
    对越南北方，美国一面玩弄所谓“暂停轰炸”的把戏，一面却接连派遣飞机到越南北方进行侦察，为制造新的罪行作准备。
    在美国空军大规模轰炸老挝解放区的同时，美国还集中大批老挝右派军队和泰国军队，在美国飞机的配合下，向中、下寮地区发动大规模的进攻，企图占领这一地区，并且利用这个地区作为把战争扩大到整个印度支那半岛的跳板。
    美国的这些扩大战争的行动，揭穿了它的假“和平”烟幕，暴露了美帝国主义极其丑恶的杀人面目。尽管美国叫嚷“和平”，但是它的每一个“和平”词句都带有血腥味。声明说，只要美帝国主义把它的所有军事人员、军队、武器和战争工具从越南南方和老挝全部撤走，停止对印度支那的一切战争行动，和平就可以立即恢复。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党中央支持越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线关于解决越南问题的四项主张和五点声明的立场；重申老挝全国政治协商会议宣言所阐述的四点声明和五项措施，是解决老挝问题的唯一基础。
    声明严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗立即停止玩弄“和平”骗局，停止把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的一切行动。否则，团结起来的老挝人民、越南人民和柬埔寨人民将把它们消灭掉。
    据新华社十九日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三十八日说，美帝国主义在侈谈所谓和平愿望的同时，正在为把侵略越南战争“逐步升级”作准备。
    野坂主席是在东京由日共组织的一次讲演会上发表这次讲话的。有一千多人听了他的讲演。
    野坂主席列举美国企图使侵越战争逐步升级的证据时说，美国计划向南越再派二十万军队；美国联邦预算中增加军费以及在实际上已把日本变成美国的核战争基地。
    野坂主席强调指出，尽管如此，美国决不能在越南取得胜利。他说：“美国已陷入不能自拔的泥潭。它越是拼命挣扎，就把自己的坟墓挖得越深。”
    野坂主席接着谴责日本佐藤政府同美国积极合作，执行美国的两面政策，并且企图把日本人民拉到战争中去。
    野坂主席说，虽然形势是紧张的，但是民主力量一直在大踏步地前进，特别是共产党已经取得巨大的进展，因此，民主力量将在这新的一年里取得光辉的成就。
    野坂参三主席谈到日本人民今年面临的主要任务是：支持越南人民的斗争；保卫人民的生活；保卫民主并粉碎自由民主党要实行小选举区制的阴谋。
