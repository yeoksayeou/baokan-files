    Xinhua News Agency, Bangui, 8th. After the Central African authorities unreasonably announced the severance of diplomatic relations with China, Zhu Junyi, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Central African Republic, and all the embassy staff members left Bangui by plane on the afternoon of the 8th to return to China.
    Chinese agricultural experts and staff members of the Xinhua News Agency's Bangui branch who were sent to the Central African Republic by the Chinese government at the request of the Central African government also left Bangui on the same plane. Before leaving, the Chinese Embassy in the Central African Republic submitted a note to the Central African Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 8th, lodging a serious protest against the slander and vilification of China by the new President of the Central African Republic, Bokassa, to cover up his unreasonable severance of diplomatic relations with China. According to reports, Bokassa made a statement to reporters on January 6, saying that the Chinese "participated in establishing a Central African people's army" and that "weapons and documents" were discovered.
    The note pointed out that Bokassa's statements were completely fabricated. The note said that the government of the People's Republic of China has always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. The note pointed out that for more than a year, the Chinese Embassy in the Central African Republic has done everything possible to promote friendship between the peoples of the two countries, which is well known. The above fabrications are completely futile.
    When Zhu Junyi, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Central African Republic, left Bangui, he issued a statement at the airport, saying that the Central African government unilaterally tore up the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Central African Republic, and went back on its promise made explicitly by its Minister of Foreign Affairs on January 5 that "the new government of the Central African Republic hopes to maintain diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China," and brazenly announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the People's

    中非当局无理宣布断绝同我外交关系后
    我临时代办和使馆全体人员离班吉
    朱君毅代办行前提交照会驳斥中非总统的造谣诬蔑
    新华社班吉八日电　在中非当局无理宣布断绝同中国的外交关系后，中国驻中非大使馆临时代办朱君毅和全体使馆工作人员八日下午乘飞机离开班吉回国。
    由中国政府应中非政府的要求而派往中非工作的中国农业专家和新华社驻班吉分社的工作人员也同机离开班吉。在离开之前，中国驻中非共和国大使馆八日上午向中非外交部提交了一份照会，对中非共和国新总统博卡萨造谣诬蔑中国以掩盖其无理断绝同中国的外交关系的行为提出严重抗议。据报道，博卡萨一月六日向记者发表谈话，说什么中国人“参与建立一支中非人民军队”，又说什么发现了“武器和文件”。
    照会指出，博卡萨的这些说法完全是凭空捏造的。照会说，中华人民共和国政府一向遵行和平共处的五项原则，从来不干涉别国的内政。照会指出，一年多来，中国驻中非共和国大使馆所做的事情都是为了促进两国人民之间的友谊，这是众所周知的。上述的捏造完全是枉费心机的。
    中国驻中非共和国大使馆临时代办朱君毅离开班吉时，在机场上发表声明说，中非政府单方面撕毁中国和中非两国建交协议，背弃了它通过它的外交部长于一月五日明确作出的“中非共和国新政府希望同中华人民共和国保持外交关系”的诺言，悍然宣布断绝同中华人民共和国的外交关系。中非政府的这一行动是毫无道理的，是不符合最起码的国际关系准则的。
    声明说，自从中国同中非共和国建立外交关系以来，中国驻中非大使馆始终根据中国政府一贯奉行的和平共处五项原则和两国之间建立外交关系的协议，致力于发展两国在各方面的友好合作关系。中国政府一贯支持中非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，维护民族独立和国家主权的斗争，从不干涉中非共和国的内政。所有这一切都充分说明了中国政府的这种立场是光明磊落的，是大家所公认的，是任何人都污蔑、歪曲不了的。因此，中非政府的这种无理行为，不仅损害它自己的国际信誉，而且也是与中非全体人民的愿望相违背的。
    他表示深信，中国和中非两国人民的友谊是任何力量破坏不了的，帝国主义及其追随者的阴谋终究是要失败的。朱君毅临时代办还对中非当局无理决定新华社驻班吉分社全体人员必须撤离中非表示遗憾。
