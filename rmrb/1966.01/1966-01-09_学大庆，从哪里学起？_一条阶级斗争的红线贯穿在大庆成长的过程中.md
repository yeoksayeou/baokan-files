    Learning from Daqing, Where to Start?
    A Red Line of Class Struggle Runs Through Daqing's Growth Process
    Editor's Note: Learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, surpass Daqing, and create more Daqing-style enterprises. This is the correct path for creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on the industrial front and fully implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. Learning from Daqing, where should we start? From the revolutionary spirit of Daqing. The revolutionary spirit of Daqing is permeated with a red line of class struggle. Daqing adheres to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, class struggle as the key link, and the struggle between two roads as the key link in all its work. It has built a modern oil base with hard work, self-reliance, and in a faster, better, and more economical way. Daqing has produced talent, oil, and experience, and above all, it has cultivated and trained a very revolutionary and strong team. Learning from Daqing means learning from this. Learning from Daqing means taking Daqing's true essence.
    In Daqing, we met some comrades from other places who came to learn. They said, "In the past two years, we have learned a lot of experience, such as the Five-Good Movement, the Four-Same, the Post Responsibility System, the Warehouse Management Method, and the Door-to-Door Delivery of Materials. They have all played a role in improving our work. But when we come to Daqing, we find that the gap between us and Daqing is very large, it’s literally one to ten thousand. Why? We have not learned the spiritual essence of Daqing's experience."
    These comrades' views indeed reflect the essence of the matter. The problems they talk about may be common problems in many places learning from Daqing.
        What Problems to Bring When Learning
    Many comrades from other places have noticed that Daqing comrades have a basic summary of their past roads and future directions. That is "unswervingly taking Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, fully implementing the general line of socialist construction; taking class struggle as the key link; taking the People's Liberation Army as an example; adhering to the principle of combining centralized leadership with a vigorous mass movement; adhering to the principle of combining a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude; adhering to the principle of technical revolution and building the country diligently and frugally, building a very revolutionary industrial army, and taking the road of China's industrialization." Examining this summary in connection with their actual situation, it can be seen that the essence of the Daqing spirit is class struggle. They are taking the road of running socialist enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought. To take this road, we must resolutely part ways with the capitalist and revisionist lines, and we must resolutely and thoroughly break with bourgeois ideology and other non-proletarian ideologies.
    Learning from Daqing, of course, can be done with various questions, technical work can be learned, and administrative management work can be learned, but first of all, we must learn with the question of "how to revolutionize." We must look for its commander through Daqing's various experiences, that is, politics, that is, class struggle, which is actually the concretization of Mao Zedong Thought. After learning the Daqing spirit, learning other things will be easy.
          The Standard of "Good"
      "Daqing people are good, unparalleled."
    How should we look at the goodness of Daqing people?
    In the eyes of Marxists and Leninists, there can only be a class standard. Among the broad masses of cadres and the people, whoever can use Mao Zedong Thought to transform non-proletarian ideology and continuously revolutionize themselves is very good.
    Daqing people did not fall from the sky. Most of them came from peasants. Quite a few technicians came from exploiting class families. Most of the young people went from home to school to the factory, without experiencing class struggle and the test of hardship. Daqing comrades said: Almost all the class struggles in society are here, almost all the thoughts in society are here, and the struggle between two roads and two kinds of thinking rises and falls like waves, just like the rest of the country.
    So, are Daqing people good? "To really know greatness, look to this era." Today's Daqing is exactly like this. Proletarian revolutionary thought occupies an overwhelming advantage, everyone is revolutionary-minded, and everyone is collective-minded. More and more heroes are emerging, and the red flag is being raised higher and higher. In this big oil field, one-third of all employees are five-good red-flag bearers, one-quarter of the teams are five-good red-flag teams, there are nearly a thousand advanced teams, and many family members are five-good. Advanced figures are simply emerging like a storm here. This is the main standard for why Daqing people are good. If advanced figures are always just a few people, coldly and sparsely, and cannot form a team or a revolutionary momentum, it is difficult to say that such a place is revolutionary.
    Thoroughbreds are always available, but talent scouts are not always available. This is the old thinking of the old era. In the Mao Zedong era, this sentence should be changed to "Thoroughbreds are always available, and talent scouts are also always available." A revolutionized Party organization is a Marxist-Leninist talent scout. They must understand how to cultivate backbones from class struggle. They must be good at using Mao Zedong Thought to change people's spiritual outlook. Wherever this is done, there will be their own Daqing people.
            Wang "Iron Man"
    The outstanding representative of Daqing people is Wang "Iron Man." Is "Iron Man" a superman? No. He is an ordinary worker, a Communist Party member. What he does are the duties that a proletarian revolutionary fighter should do: resolutely listen to the Party, play an exemplary role everywhere; not for fame, not for profit, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, wholeheartedly for the revolution.
    When Daqing Oilfield began construction, it encountered difficulties in two aspects: one was objective, with poor material and technical conditions; the other was subjective, with some people lacking ideological preparation for carrying out the revolution, that is, overcoming difficulties. Among some people, the question of "whether to build, whether it can be built, and whether to dare to build" arose. If this ideological problem is not resolved, it will be difficult to work together to fight against the earth.
    Daqing people did not avoid struggle. The oilfield leading organs handed the problem over to the masses to solve. The answer from the workers was: "We want revolution, we want construction, we want victory."
  "We must work hard, be self-reliant and do it." The advanced elements among the masses acted, and the "Iron Man" spirit represented by Comrade Wang Jinxi emerged, fighting against the sky, fighting against the earth, and fighting against people's wrong ideas.
    Comrade Wang Jinxi's "Iron Man" title was given by the masses. He took the lead in drilling wells, and did not leave the front line even when injured, saying: "I am not a clay figure, how can I fall apart with just a touch." He insisted on continuing to work. Once, a sign of a blowout accident occurred at the well site. Upon hearing the news, Wang Jinxi immediately jumped into the mud pool with his injured leg to stir the mud, finally eliminating the sign of the blowout accident. At that time, he was living in a farmer's house. The old lady landlord was very concerned about Wang Jinxi, so she went to the well site to visit him. She saw Wang Jinxi living and working hard on the well site for days and nights, and was very moved. She said: "Jinxi, Jinxi, you are really an iron man!"
    The leading comrades seized on this sentence from the old lady and shouted loudly at the workers' meeting: "Learn from the Iron Man, carry forward the Iron Man spirit." Everyone compared themselves with the Iron Man and learned from the Iron Man, so a surge of learning from the Iron Man appeared in various units.
    Daqing people are "Iron Man." The Daqing spirit is, in a sense, the "Iron Man" spirit. The deeds of the "Iron Man" are not a certain accidental heroic behavior of one person, but the embodiment of the proletarian revolutionary spirit forged by the Chinese proletariat in struggle under the leadership of the Party, and the embodiment of the spirit of striving for strength, hard work, self-reliance, and building the country diligently and frugally. This spirit can resist the ideological invasion of the bourgeoisie in all aspects.
    One thing that educated us deeply. A reporter took an article describing the deeds of Wang Iron Man to Wang Jinxi for verification. This reporter initially thought the problem was very simple. An article praising the Iron Man would not involve any major substantive issues, right? He said to Comrade Wang Jinxi: "It won't take much time, one and a half hours is enough." Who knew that Comrade Wang Jinxi spent four and a half hours checking it. His overall evaluation was: "I can only agree with 15% of this manuscript." Then he added with emphasis: "Even 20% cannot be reached." Because of space constraints, we cannot narrate the details, but one passage from the "Iron Man" is worth pondering for all comrades who wield pens. The original words are like this:
      "The manuscript portrays me as fighting alone, acting arbitrarily, without the Party, without leadership, without the masses. It's as if it's just me, Wang Jinxi, working hard alone. What have they portrayed me as!"
      "They have portrayed me in a distorted way. This is not a personal problem for me. What am I worth? This is the work of the Party. The leadership of the Party should be seen, and the masses should be seen."
    Revolutionized Model
      "Iron Man" is a model of Daqing people's revolutionization. Each unit in Daqing has its own model. In addition, there are collective models, such as the 1202 Iron and Steel Drilling Team, the 32139 Drilling Team, the Oil Construction Eleventh Team, the Third Mine Fourth Team, the Transportation Second Team, etc. "Establishing revolutionary models" is an important content and method of class struggle and class education. Ideological struggle is a struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. The revolutionary banner must be clear. Revolutionary models are the clear banner of proletarian ideology; with living models, the masses can see and touch them, they are the most persuasive, and they can compare with stinking bourgeois ideology, and they can use revolutionary "models" as weapons to launch a tit-for-tat struggle against bourgeois ideology.
    According to Daqing's experience, establishing models must embody Mao Zedong Thought, must be closely combined with the three major revolutionary movements, and must closely combine a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a high degree of scientific spirit. The models must be politically and productively qualified. Therefore, the leadership's requirements for the models must be very strict. After they are established, they must constantly use the dialectical method of "one divides into two" to help the models find shortcomings, promote advantages, overcome shortcomings, and constantly improve.
    How do Daqing people use the "Iron Man" model in ideological transformation? In a certain drilling team, a worker criticized a cadre, saying: "You are different from the Iron Man. You did not embody Mao Zedong Thought when praising and criticizing, nor did you embody the viewpoint of class struggle."
  "At first, I didn't want to be a driver. You said: 'Go ahead, if your body is not good in winter, I will let you go to a sanatorium.' This is not using the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly to educate us, but is about the same as my level at the time." He also said: "Once, I used a wrench as a hammer when operating. You criticized me and said: 'You are back to your old habits. If you do this again, I will deduct six yuan from your bonus!' This is not highlighting politics, but is putting money in command." This method of "inducing" people with "sanatoriums" and "educating" people with "deducting bonuses" is of course a bourgeois idea and style that must be corrected.
    Starting from one's own actual situation and comparing oneself with the model, one can promote the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of workers. In the revolutionary movement and in daily work, promote the advantages of everyone, encourage even the smallest progress of everyone, and also carry out criticism and self-criticism. A kind of self-criticism full of revolutionary consciousness occupies an important position in ideological struggle. And criticism is actually helping comrades with the feelings of class brothers. The famous pace-setter and driller Wei Guangrong has a very famous formulation: "To help people, help their hearts; to help their hearts, know their hearts; to know their hearts, care for them; to care for them, trust them." The so-called "trust" is to believe that our comrades can make progress.
        "The serious problem is the education of the peasantry"
    Daqing comrades say: In the oil field, there is also a "serious problem of educating the peasantry." Daqing is an industrial enterprise, and the workers are the working class. Why is there still a serious problem of educating the peasantry? This is because: the vast majority of workers come from peasants, and they still have thousands of ties with the countryside, and the struggle between the two roads in the countryside is often reflected in their thinking. Of course, the peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, are willing to accept the leadership of the proletariat and are happy to accept Mao Zedong Thought. Precisely because of this, many people quickly enter the ranks of advanced elements after joining the oil field work.
    However, there are also some people who have reversals and twists and turns in their progress, and often fluctuate due to changes in the objective situation and the conditions of their units. When the oilfield work encounters difficulties, some people have thoughts of homesickness and feel that "working as a worker is not as good as being a farmer"; when the lives of the workers improve, some people have a complacent and satisfied mentality of "wife, children, and warm kang." Therefore, the Daqing Oilfield Party Committee has always believed that: to build the oil worker team into a team with a high degree of proletarian consciousness, the fundamental problem is to firmly grasp class education, firmly grasp class struggle, grasp it every year, grasp it at all times, and grasp it regularly.
    Both praising and criticizing, with praise as the main thing, will this weaken the role of class struggle? Praise, like criticism, must have strong class content. The good people and good deeds that are praised must conform to the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Praise itself is to clearly establish the leading aspect of class struggle, and at the same time, it does not relax the criticism of all non-proletarian ideas and styles.
      Will the "Five-Good Movement" cover up contradictions? "Good" is first of all strictly evaluated according to the standards of the proletariat. Moreover, evaluating "Five-Good" is linked to finding shortcomings. In a unit, immediately following the "Five-Good" general evaluation, contradictions must be fully exposed, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out in a realistic way, and mass debates must be launched.
      "Remembering bitterness and thinking about sweetness" is class struggle and class education, which is of great significance for those who have suffered oppression and exploitation in the old society; for those who have grown up in a "sugar bowl" in the new society, it is even more significant to understand the suffering of their predecessors and the sweetness they now feel. However, it is not enough to just "remember bitterness and think about sweetness," but also to raise it to the level of the proletariat. In Daqing's winter political rectification in 1965, the focus was also on "team history," talking about the team's development history, and talking about how proletarian thought fought against bourgeois thought. The main method of class education is to present living examples of advanced and backward thinking for everyone to judge, and to inspire people to consciously revolutionize.
        Resolutely Break with the Bourgeois Worldview
    In Daqing, there are many intellectuals, accounting for about one-seventh of all employees. Among them, a considerable number come from exploiting class families. However, people who come to Daqing have a common impression: you can't tell who is an intellectual in labor, and everyone sounds like an intellectual in the speeches at the meetings.
    Here, less than 1% are old experts who came from the old society. The vast majority of intellectuals grew up in the new society. However, when they stepped out of the school gate and came to the oil field, many people still brought strong old ideas and old styles. Despising labor, seeking fame and fortune, worshipping foreign countries, and copying books to the death are common problems for quite a few people.
    Educating intellectuals is different from educating people from peasant backgrounds. The Daqing Oilfield Party Organization, based on the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, has let these intellectuals participate in the three major revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments together with the workers and masses from the day they arrived at the oil field, helping them to transform themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Through laboring and practicing with the workers, they realize the transformation of their worldview.
    Liu Wenzhang, the deputy chief engineer of Daqing Oilfield and director of the Oil Production Technology Research Institute, who came from a landlord family, said: "To carry out scientific experiments, we must first carry out class struggle; if the battle of class struggle is fought well, the victory of scientific experiments will be guaranteed." "If the worldview problem is not solved, nothing can be done well." His own experience is like this. After studying "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" over and over again, he recalled that his father hired long-term workers to farm every year, harvesting more than 25,000 catties of grain, while the income of the long-term workers was less than 5% of these grains, and they could not get enough food and clothing all year round. He realized that he must thoroughly draw a line with the ideology of the exploiting class and thoroughly break with the bourgeois worldview. After joining the Party in 1957, he has always demanded himself with the high standards of the proletarian vanguard. He often guards against his individualistic bad roots, preventing the influence of capitalism and revisionism from taking advantage of loopholes. He strived to summarize experience from practice and constantly move forward. Finally, he and some technicians and workers creatively designed a new type of layered oil production device, making a major contribution to the development of the oil field. When he first accepted this task, he excitedly expressed at the meeting: "What kind of proletariat is it if we only crawl behind others!"
    In Daqing, many intellectuals are not only politically red, but also ideologically red. Everyone says that if the problem of ideological methods is not solved, the theory will be divorced from reality, and it will be impossible to talk to leading comrades and worker comrades, the style will not match, and the work will not be close.
            Fight Political Battles
    The construction speed of Daqing Oilfield is much faster than that of oilfields of the same scale in foreign countries, and it has truly achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results. This is because Daqing people dare to compete with reactionaries of all countries and dare to foster the ambition of the proletariat. Their slogan is: Establish lofty ambitions, set great aspirations, independently and self-reliantly take down the big oilfield at high speed and high level, and get rid of the backward hat.
    Although my country is the first civilized country to exploit oil, in recent centuries, under the aggression of imperialism and reactionary rule, the oil industry has been greatly backward. From 1907 to 1949, in forty-two years, old China produced a total of only 2.7 million tons of crude oil. In 1949, only 69,000 tons were produced. By 1960, although my country's oil had developed relatively quickly, due to the thin foundation and weak technology, a considerable part of it was still not self-sufficient. In 1960, when my country suffered severe natural disasters, Khrushchev revisionists attempted to strangle us. They were convinced that New China could not survive without "foreign oil."
    The American magazine "World Oil" also said: "The Soviet Union's decision to withdraw experts from China, a large number of unskilled workers cannot replace experts"; "The small teapot-style refining device produces the worst quality products at extremely high costs." "Red China does not have enough fuel to fight a modern war, even a completely defensive modern war, ... not even for a few weeks."
    Daqing Oilfield employees regarded the conspiracies and slanders of class enemies as negative teaching materials, and resolutely conducted a firm struggle against enemies in the international arena on the issue of oil production. They regarded taking down the oilfield as a gift to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Their slogan is: "The well site is the battlefield for anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism." The result of the competition is that the "small teapot" has become a large oilfield, and "unskilled workers" have become a revolutionary team that is both red and expert.
    Daqing employees regard the production battle as a political battle. In their view, the modernization of the oil industry mainly depends not on technical issues, but on ideological revolutionization. They specifically analyzed the situation of large oilfields in the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries, and turned the original development of new technologies and new processes into a struggle to compete for time and level with imperialism and revisionism. Dare to catch up, dare to surpass, with surpassing as the main thing. Dare to learn, dare to break through, with breaking through as the main thing. Taking core sampling technology as an example, the average core recovery rate in 1964 was 98.8%, which is the world's level. They also created the technology of taking out a 64.47-meter-long core barrel, reaching the world's advanced level. However, they are not satisfied with taking down the big oilfield and these technical achievements. They said: "A big oilfield can be exhausted, the important thing is to cultivate a revolutionary team armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With this team, we can develop many big oilfields, and even create many revolutionary new people, to ensure the complete victory of socialism and communism in the future." This is the focus of Daqing people in running industry.
                      ×　　　　×　　 פון　×
    To understand Daqing from the meaning of class struggle, integrate Daqing's good experiences and good methods, and apply them comprehensively and correctly, is the only way to learn the true essence, and can also avoid the malady of only learning the superficial aspects and blindly copying, only looking at one point and not seeing the rest. On this issue, whether or not the Daqing spirit can be learned depends on the leadership, and the key lies in whether the leadership has a correct understanding of the Daqing spirit. If the leadership's understanding is correct, they personally learn, personally grasp, creatively study and apply it starting from reality, and they will definitely be able to truly learn the Daqing spirit.

### 学大庆，从哪里学起？  一条阶级斗争的红线贯穿在大庆成长的过程中

专栏：

    学大庆，从哪里学起？
    一条阶级斗争的红线贯穿在大庆成长的过程中
    编者按：学大庆，赶大庆，超大庆，创造更多的大庆式企业，这是在工业战线上活学活用毛泽东思想，全面贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的正确道路。学大庆，从哪里学起呢？从大庆的革命精神学起。大庆的革命精神贯穿着一条阶级斗争的红线。大庆在一切工作中坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，以阶级斗争为纲，以两条道路斗争为纲，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，多快好省地建设了一个现代化的石油基地。大庆出了人材，出了石油，出了经验，首先是培养和锻炼出一支非常革命化的坚强队伍。学大庆，就要从这里学起。学大庆，就要取大庆的真经。
    在大庆，见到了一些外地来学习的同志，他们说：“这两年我们学了许多经验，象五好运动、四个一样、岗位责任制、仓库管理法、送料上门，等等，都对我们改进工作起了作用。可是来大庆一看，发现我们同大庆的差距大得很，简直是一比一万。为什么呢？我们没有把大庆经验的精神实质学到手。”
    这些同志的看法，的确反映了事物的本质。他们谈的问题，可能是许多地方学大庆中普遍存在的问题。
        带着什么问题学
    许多外地同志都注意到，大庆同志对自己走过的道路和前进方向有一个基本的概括，那就是“坚定不移地以毛泽东思想为指针，全面贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线；以阶级斗争为纲；以解放军为榜样；坚持集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的原则；坚持高度革命精神和严格科学态度相结合的原则；坚持技术革命和勤俭建国的原则，建设一支非常革命化的产业大军，走中国工业化的道路。”把他们这种概括和他们的实际情况联系起来加以考察，就可以看出，大庆精神的实质是阶级斗争。他们走的是用毛泽东思想办社会主义企业的道路。走这条道路，就要坚决同资本主义、修正主义的路线分道扬镳，就要坚决地与资产阶级思想及其它各种非无产阶级思想彻底决裂。
    学大庆，当然可以带着各种问题去学，可以学技术工作，也可以学行政管理工作，但首先要带着“怎样革命化”的问题去学。要透过大庆的各种经验去找它的统帅，这就是政治，就是阶级斗争，实际上就是毛泽东思想的具体化。学了大庆精神，再学其它东西，便会一通百通。
          “好”的标准
      “大庆人好，比不了。”
    大庆人的好，应该怎样看？
    什么是好的标准？在马克思列宁主义者看来，只能是阶级的标准。在广大干部和群众中间，谁能用毛泽东思想改造非无产阶级思想，不断革命，谁就好得很。
    大庆人，不是从天上掉下来的。他们大多数来自农民。相当多的技术人员出身于剥削阶级家庭。大多数青年是从家门到校门到厂门，没有经过阶级斗争和艰难困苦的考验。大庆同志们说：社会上有的阶级斗争这里差不多都有，社会上有的思想这里差不多都有，两条道路、两种思想的斗争同全国一样波浪起伏。
    那么，大庆人是不是好呢？“数风流人物还看今朝”。今天的大庆正是这样。无产阶级革命思想占压倒优势，人人心向革命，心向集体。英雄越来越多，红旗越举越高。这个大油田，五好红旗手占全体职工的三分之一，五好红旗队占四分之一，先进班组近千，五好家属很多。先进人物在这里简直是风起云涌。这就是大庆人之所以好的主要标准。如果，先进人物老是那几个人，冷冷清清，形成不了队伍，形成不了革命声势，那样的地方，很难说是革命化。
    千里马常有，伯乐不常有。这是旧时代的旧思想。在毛泽东时代这句话应当改变为“千里马常有，伯乐也常有”。一个革命化了的党组织，就是马克思列宁主义的伯乐。他们要懂得从阶级斗争中培养骨干。要善于用毛泽东思想来改变人的精神面貌。那里这样作了，那里就有自己的大庆人。
            王“铁人”
    大庆人的突出代表是王铁人。“铁人”是超人吗？不。他是一个普通的工人，一个共产党员。他作的事，都是无产阶级革命战士应当作的份内的事情：坚决听党的话，处处起模范作用；不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心一意为革命。
    大庆油田开始建设时，遇到了两个方面的困难：一方面是客观上的，物质条件和技术条件都差；一个是主观上的，有些人对干革命就是战胜困难，缺少思想准备。在一部分人中产生了“要不要建设，能不能建设，敢不敢建设”的问题。这个思想问题不解决，就难以齐心努力同地球作战。
    大庆人没有回避斗争，油田领导机关把问题交给群众，由群众解决问题。职工们的回答是：“要革命，要建设，要胜利。”
  “要艰苦奋斗自力更生地干”。群众中的先进分子行动起来了，出现了以王进喜同志为代表的与天斗，与地斗，与人的错误思想斗的“铁人”精神。
    王进喜同志的“铁人”称号是群众给起的。他带头打井，受伤不下火线，说：“我又不是泥人，那能碰一下就散了。”他坚持继续工作。有一次，井场发生井喷事故的苗头。王进喜闻讯，立即拖着受伤的腿跳进了泥浆池搅拌泥浆，终于把井喷事故的苗头给消灭了。当时，他住在老乡家，房东老太太很关心王进喜，就到井场来看望他。她看见王进喜几天几夜住在井场上苦干，非常感动，就说：“进喜呀，进喜，你可真是个铁人呐！”
    领导同志抓住了老太太这句话，在职工大会上振臂高呼：“向铁人学习，发扬铁人精神”。人人对照铁人检查自己，人人学习铁人，于是各单位都出现了学铁人的热潮。
    大庆人就是“铁人”。大庆精神在某种意义上，就是“铁人”精神。“铁人”的事迹不是一个人的某种偶然的英勇行为，而是中国无产阶级在党领导下在斗争中锤炼出来的无产阶级革命精神的体现，是奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、自力更生、勤俭建国的精神的体现。这种精神能在一切方面抵抗资产阶级的思想侵袭。
    有一件事使我们深深受到了教育。有位记者拿了一篇描述王铁人事迹的文章找王进喜同志核对事实。这位记者开始以为问题很简单，一篇表扬铁人的文章，总该不会涉及什么重大的实质性问题吧！就向王进喜同志说：“用不了多少时间，有一个多小时就够了。”谁知，王进喜同志一核对就用了四个半小时。他的总评价是：“这稿子我只能同意百分之十五”。接着又加重语气说道：“连百分之二十都到不了。”因为篇幅的关系，我们不能叙述细节，但是“铁人”有一段话值得所有摇笔杆的同志们好好思索一番。原话是这样的：
      “稿子把我写成孤军作战，独断独行，没有党，没有领导，没有群众。好象就是我王进喜一个人苦干。把我写成了什么样子！”
      “把我写得走了样，这不是我个人的问题，我个人值几分钱？这是党的工作。应该看到党的领导，应该看到群众。”
    革命化的样板
      “铁人”，是大庆人革命化的一个样板。大庆各单位，都有自己的样板。此外，还有集体的样板，如一二○二钢铁钻井队、三二一三九钻井队、油建十一中队、三矿四队、运输二中队等等。“大树革命样板”是阶级斗争、阶级教育的一个重要内容和重要方法。思想斗争是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想双方的斗争，革命旗帜必须鲜明。革命样板就是无产阶级思想的鲜明的旗帜；有了活样板，群众看得见，摸得着，最有说服力，就能比臭资产阶级思想，就能以革命“样板”为武器，与资产阶级思想展开针锋相对的斗争。
    根据大庆的经验，树立样板要能体现毛泽东思想，要和三大革命运动紧密结合，要把高度的革命精神和高度的科学精神紧密结合。样板要在政治上生产上过得硬。因此，领导上对样板的要求要十分严格，树立起来之后，要不断用两分法帮助样板找差距，发扬优点，克服缺点，不断完善。
    大庆人在思想改造中怎样运用“铁人”的样板呢？在某钻井队中，有个工人批评一位干部说：“你就和铁人不同，你在表扬和批评时没有体现毛泽东思想，也没有体现出阶级斗争的观点。”
  “开始，我不愿意当司机，你说：‘你干吧，冬天身体如果不行，让你去疗养。’这不是用全心全意为人民服务的思想教育我们，而跟我当时的水平差不多。”又说：“有一次，我操作时把扳手当榔头用，你就批评我说：‘你老毛病又犯啦，再这样，就扣你六块钱奖金！’这不是突出政治，是用钱挂帅。”这种用“疗养”“诱导”人、用“扣奖金”“教育”人的办法，当然是必须纠正的资产阶级的思想和作风。
    从自己的实际出发，同样板找差距，可以促进广大职工的思想革命化。在革命运动中、在日常工作中，发扬每一个人的优点，鼓励每一个人那怕是微小的进步，同时也开展批评与自我批评。一种充满革命自觉的自我批评，在思想斗争中占着重要的位置。而批评，实际上是满怀阶级兄弟感情去帮助同志。著名标兵、司钻魏光荣有一个非常著名的提法：“帮人要帮心，帮心要知心，知心要关心，关心要相信。”所谓“相信”，就是相信我们的同志能够进步。
        “严重的问题是教育农民”
    大庆的同志说：在油田中，同样有个“严重的问题是教育农民”。大庆是工业企业，职工是工人阶级，为什么还有个教育农民的严重问题呢？这是因为：绝大多数工人出身于农民，他们和农村还有千丝万缕的联系，农村两条道路的斗争经常反映到他们的思想中。当然，农民，主要是贫下中农，是愿意接受无产阶级领导的，是乐于接受毛泽东思想的。正因为这样，许多人在参加油田工作以后，很快就进入先进分子的行列。
    可是，也有一些人进步中还有反复和曲折，常常因客观形势和本单位情况的变化而有波动。当油田工作遇到困难时，有人就起了思乡的念头，觉得“工不如农”；当职工生活改善后，有人又出现了“老婆孩子热炕头”的自满自足的心理。因此，大庆油田党委一直认为：要把石油工人的队伍建设成为一支有高度的无产阶级觉悟的队伍，根本问题是要狠抓阶级教育，狠抓阶级斗争，年年抓，时时抓，经常抓。
    既表扬，又批评，以表扬为主，会不会减弱了阶级斗争的作用？表扬，同批评一样，要有强烈的阶级内容。表扬的好人好事必须符合无产阶级的革命精神。表扬本身是为了鲜明地树立阶级斗争的主导方面，同时也不放松批判一切非无产阶级的思想和作风。
      “五好运动”会不会掩盖矛盾？“好”首先是严格地按照无产阶级的标准来评定的。而且，评“五好”同找差距是联在一起的。在一个单位，紧跟着“五好”总评以后，就要充分地揭露矛盾，实事求是地进行批评和自我批评，群众性的开展大辩论。
      “忆苦思甜”是阶级斗争和阶级教育，对于受过旧社会的压迫和剥削的人来说，有十分重要的意义；对于在新社会“糖罐”里长大的人来说，了解一下前辈人受的苦和现在感受到的甜，更有十分重大的意义。但是，仅仅“忆苦思甜”还不够，还要把它提高到无产阶级的水平上来。在大庆一九六五年的冬季政治整训中，又着重讲了“队史”，讲了队的发展历史，讲了无产阶级思想怎样与资产阶级思想作斗争。阶级教育的主要方法是摆出先进思想和落后思想的活典型让大家评判，启发人们自觉革命。
        坚决同资产阶级世界观决裂
    在大庆，知识分子是很多的，大约占全体职工总数的七分之一。其中，剥削阶级家庭出身的又占相当的数量。但是，到大庆的人们都有一个普遍的印象：在劳动中看不出谁是知识分子，从会议上的发言中听起来个个都象知识分子。
    在这里，从旧社会过来的老专家连百分之一都不到。绝大多数知识分子都成长于新社会。可是，当他们踏出学校大门来到油田的时候，有许多人带来的旧思想旧作风还是很强烈的。轻视劳动，沽名钓誉，迷信外国，死抄书本，是相当多的人的通病。
    教育知识分子和教育农民出身的人是有所不同的。大庆油田党组织依据党中央和毛主席的教导，从这些知识分子到油田那一天起，就让他们与工人群众一同参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三大革命运动，帮助他们用毛泽东思想改造自己。通过同工人一起劳动和实践，使他们实现世界观的改造。
    地主阶级家庭出身的、大庆油田副总工程师兼采油工艺研究所所长刘文章说过：“搞科学实验，首先要搞阶级斗争；阶级斗争这一仗打得好，科学实验的胜利才有保证。”“世界观问题不解决，什么也干不好”。他自己的经历就是这样。他一遍又一遍地学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》以后，回忆起自己的父亲，每年雇上长工种地，收粮食二万五千多斤，而长工们的收入还不到这些粮食的百分之五，终年不得温饱。他认识到，必须彻底与剥削阶级思想划清界限，与资产阶级世界观彻底决裂。他一九五七年入党后，一直以无产阶级先锋队的高标准要求自己。他经常警惕自己的个人主义劣根性，防止资本主义、修正主义的影响钻空子。他努力从实践中总结经验，不断前进，终于和一些技术人员、工人一起独创地设计出了一种新型的分层采油装置器，为油田的开发作出了重大的贡献。在开始接受这个任务时，他曾在会上激动地表示过：“只跟别人的屁股后面爬行，还算什么无产阶级！”
    在大庆，许多知识分子不仅政治上红，而且思想方法上也红。大家说，思想方法问题不解决，理论脱离实际，就和领导同志、和工人同志谈不到一起，作风合不来，工作靠不拢。
            打政治仗
    大庆油田建设速度比外国同样规模的油田要快得多，真正做到了多快好省。这是因为大庆人敢同各国反动派较量短长，敢于长无产阶级志气。他们的口号是：树雄心，立壮志，独立自主地高速度、高水平地拿下大油田，甩掉落后帽子。
    尽管我国是第一个采油的文明古国，但是，近世纪来，在帝国主义侵略和反动统治下，石油工业是大大落后了。从一九○七年到一九四九年的四十二年，旧中国一共只生产了二百七十多万吨原油。一九四九年只生产六万九千吨。到一九六○年，我国石油虽然有了较快的发展，但由于底子薄，技术弱，仍然有相当大的部分不能自给。在一九六○年我国遭受严重的自然灾害的情况下，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者妄图扼杀我们。他们满以为，新中国没有“洋油”就过不了日子。
    美国《世界石油》杂志也说：“苏联决定自中国撤退专家，大量的非熟练工人并不能代替专家”；“小茶壶式的炼油装置用极高的成本生产质量最次的产品”。“红色中国没有足够的燃料来打一场现代化的战争，甚至是一场完全防御性的现代化战争，……连几个星期也不行。”
    大庆油田职工把阶级敌人的阴谋和诽谤看作是反面教材，坚决在石油生产问题上同国际范围内的敌人进行了坚决的斗争。他们把拿下油田看作是对中国革命和世界革命的献礼。他们的口号是：“井场就是反帝反修的战场”。较量的结果是，“小茶壶”变成了大油田，“非熟练工人”变成了又红又专的革命队伍。
    大庆职工把生产仗当作政治仗打。在他们看来，石油工业现代化，主要不决定于技术问题，而决定于思想革命化。他们具体分析了美苏等国大油田情况，把独创地发展新技术、新工艺变成同帝国主义修正主义争时间、争水平的斗争。敢赶，敢超，以超为主。敢学，敢闯，以闯为主。拿取岩心技术为例，一九六四年平均岩心收获率为百分之九十八点八，是世界的水平。还创造出取出长筒取岩心六十四点四七米的技术，达到了世界先进水平。但是，他们并不满足于拿下了大油田和这些技术成就。他们说：“一个大油田是可以开采完的，重要的问题在于培养一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命队伍，有了这一支队伍，可以开发许多大油田，更可以造就许多革命新人，保证将来社会主义和共产主义的完全胜利。”这就是大庆人办工业的着眼点。

    从阶级斗争的意义上去认识大庆，把大庆各个方面的好经验、好办法融会贯通起来，加以全面地正确地运用，才有可能学到真经，也可以避免只学皮毛生搬硬套，只看一点，不及其余的流弊。在这个问题上，能不能把大庆精神学到手，关键在于领导，关键在于领导方面对大庆精神是否有正确的认识。领导认识对头了，亲自学，亲自抓，从实际出发活学活用，就一定能真正把大庆精神学到手。
