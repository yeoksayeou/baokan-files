    In the province-wide movement in Gansu to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and assist the advanced agricultural model of Dazhai-style agriculture—Huoshaogou, the cadres and members of the Huoshaogou Production Team have even more enthusiasm. Since last winter, they have further developed the revolutionary hard-bone spirit, and in more than two months, they have covered 42 mu of sandy fields, nearly doubling the amount of sandy fields covered in the winter of 1964, and have met high standards. At the same time, they also leveled more than 200 mu of dry land.

    Gao Xueyong, the captain of the Huoshaogou Production Team, visited advanced agricultural units such as the Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, last year, bringing back new revolutionary enthusiasm to the people of Huoshaogou. The cadres and members repeatedly held discussions, found shortcomings in many ways, tapped potential, and resolved to learn from Dazhai, catch up with Dazhai, and surpass Dazhai.

    Recently, they carefully studied the production plan for this year item by item and clarified their goals. Cadres and members unanimously stated: In the new year, they must vigorously grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, continue to wage a tenacious struggle with nature, and continue to carry out large-scale farmland capital construction and afforestation.

    They also decided to plant five mu of fine seed experimental fields this year, introduce eight or nine kinds of drought-resistant and high-yield spring wheat fine seeds, and trial-plant six mu of high-yield crops such as corn, and all spring-sown wheat seeds will be treated with fungicide. Most of these preparations have been completed.

    火烧沟生产队决心进一步学习毛泽东著作
    用硬骨头精神继续改造自然
    在甘肃全省学习大寨式农业先进典型——火烧沟的比学赶帮超竞赛运动中，火烧沟生产队干部和社员的干劲更足了。去冬以来，他们进一步发扬了革命硬骨头精神，两个多月，铺压砂田四十二亩，比一九六四年冬季多压砂田将近一倍，而且达到了高标准的要求。同时，还平整了二百多亩旱地。
    火烧沟生产队队长高学勇，去年到山西昔阳县大寨大队等农业先进单位参观，给火烧沟人带回了新的革命干劲。干部和社员，反复地进行了座谈讨论，多方找差距，挖潜力，决心学大寨、赶大寨、超大寨。
    最近，他们对今年的生产计划逐条作了认真研究，明确了奋斗目标。干部和社员一致表示：在新的一年中，要狠抓毛主席著作的学习，用毛主席思想指导生产，继续同大自然作顽强的斗争，继续大搞农田基本建设，大搞植树造林。
    他们还决定今年种五亩良种试验田，引进八、九种耐旱高产春麦良种，试种六亩玉米等高产作物，春播麦种全部进行药剂拌种。这些准备工作大部已经做好。
