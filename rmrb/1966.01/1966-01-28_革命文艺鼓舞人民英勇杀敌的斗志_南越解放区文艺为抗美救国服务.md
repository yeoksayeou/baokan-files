    (Reported by our newspaper) According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the past five years, the young revolutionary art and literature of South Vietnam has developed rapidly and achieved brilliant successes in the anti-American national salvation struggle. Now, in the liberated areas, cultural work troupes have been established everywhere, and songs and poems are flying all around. Wherever the enemy retreats from, revolutionary art and literature immediately appears, mobilizing and inspiring the masses to rise up and struggle with an earth-shattering momentum.
    The revolutionary art and literature workers of South Vietnam not only delve deep into the masses, but also frequently throw themselves into the battlefield, creating and performing while fighting and killing the enemy.
    In terms of revolutionary literature, many inspiring and excellent works reflecting the heroic struggle and victorious advance of the South Vietnamese people have been published in recent years. In addition to the widely distributed and influential books at home and abroad, such as "Letters from the South" and "Live Like Him," there are also excellent short stories and reportage such as "The Rolling Mekong River," "Letters from Ca Mau," "Majestic Truong Son," "The Story of Our Village," and "Hard Days," as well as a collection of stories about heroes of the South Vietnam Liberation Army. As of recently, the Liberation Film Studio has already produced more than ten valuable films.

    革命文艺鼓舞人民英勇杀敌的斗志
    南越解放区文艺为抗美救国服务
    本报讯　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，五年来，越南南方年轻的革命文艺在抗美救国斗争中迅速地发展，取得光辉的成就。现在，在解放区，各地纷纷成立了文工队，到处歌声飞扬，诗声琅琅。敌人从哪里溃退，那里就立即有革命文艺出现，动员和鼓舞群众以移山倒海的气势起来斗争。
    南越的革命文艺工作者不仅深入群众，而且经常投身于战场，边创作、表演，边战斗、杀敌。
    在革命文学方面，几年来出版了许许多多激动人心的反映南越人民英勇战斗和胜利前进的出色作品。除在国内外广泛发行，影响巨大的《南方来信》、《象他那样生活》等书外，还有较优秀的短篇小说和报告文学《滚滚的九龙江》、《金瓯书简》、《雄伟的长山》、《我们村庄的故事》和《艰苦的日子》等，以及一批南方解放军英雄的故事。截至最近为止，解放电影制片厂已经摄制了十多部很有价值的影片。
