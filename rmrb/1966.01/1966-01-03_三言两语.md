    Three quick comments
    An Associated Press report, quoting sources close to Johnson, said: "The President's biggest disappointment in 1965 was the setbacks he encountered in Vietnam."
    This is the truth. However, since Johnson pinned his greatest hopes on expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, then his greatest disappointment in 1966 will inevitably be encountering even greater setbacks in Vietnam.

    U.S. Presidential Special Assistant Valenti, speaking in Taiwan about the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam, clamored: "The United States will win this war even if it stays in Vietnam for five years, ten years, or longer."
    American imperialism can certainly have its own plans, but haven't many U.S. military and political leaders already admitted that the U.S. cannot win the war of aggression against Vietnam? Then, who does Valenti think he can scare with this boast? For U.S. imperialism, the only question is whether it admits defeat now or admits defeat after suffering even more. No matter how it continues to "escalate," failure is inevitable. To talk about "winning this war" is purely a fool's dream.

    The U.S. military barracks in Da Lat were bombed on New Year's Eve, resulting in a scene of utter chaos. It is said that the invading U.S. troops had always called Da Lat "the most peaceful and brightest city" in South Vietnam. The day before the bombing, the Americans were still joking, saying: "Because Da Lat has cool weather, the Viet Cong regard it as a place for rest and recreation."
    They may also have been right. Seeing the panicked and miserable appearance of the American young masters after being bombed, it is undoubtedly a unique form of rest and recreation for the South Vietnamese people's armed forces!

    三言两语
    美联社报道，据接近约翰逊的人士说：“总统在一九六五年最大的失望是他在越南遇到挫折”。
    这是实话。不过，既然约翰逊把他最大的希望寄托在扩大侵越战争上面，那末他在一九六六年最大的失望必然将会是在越南遇到更大的挫折。

    美国总统特别助理瓦伦蒂在台湾谈到美国的侵越政策，叫嚷道：“美国即使在越南呆五年、十年，或更长的时间，也要赢得这场战争的胜利”。
    美帝国主义当然可以有它自己的打算，但是，连美国的许多军政头目不是都已经承认，美国在侵越战争中是打不赢的了吗？那末，瓦伦蒂想拿这种大话来吓唬谁呢？对于美帝国主义来说，只有现在趁早承认失败还是再吃更多的苦头才承认失败的问题。不管它怎样继续“升级”，失败是注定了的。什么“赢得这场战争”云云，完全是痴人说梦。

    大叻的美军宿舍除夕挨炸，狼狈万状。据说侵越美军过去一直把大叻称作是南越“最平静最明媚的城市”。挨炸前一天，美国佬还在开玩笑说：“由于大叻天气凉爽，越共把它当作休息和娱乐地”。
    他们也可能说对了。看看美国少爷兵吃了炸弹后惊慌失措、喊爹叫娘的狼狈相，对于南越人民武装，未始不是一种别开生面的休息和娱乐！
