    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 21st Dispatch: The American aggressor troops and South Korean puppet troops in Saigon, already frightened out of their wits by the attacks of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, panicked on the 21st at noon upon hearing the sound of firecrackers being set off by residents for the Spring Festival. They fired their guns wildly and shot at each other, a truly ugly spectacle.
    According to Western news agencies, a convoy carrying South Korean puppet troops was driving down a street in Saigon on the 21st when suddenly they heard a series of firecracker explosions. The dozen or so soldiers on board, already like birds startled by the twang of a bow, thought they were under attack and immediately fired wildly at nearby trees and buildings. At this time, a truckload of American soldiers driving in the opposite direction heard the gunfire and also thought they were about to be punished by the Vietnamese people. They jumped out of the truck in a panic and fired at the trees. According to an Associated Press report, amidst the chaos, the American and South Korean troops even shot at each other. A large area was placed under alert.

    西贡爆竹声  吓破美军胆
    新华社二十一日讯  西贡消息：被越南南方解放武装力量的攻击吓破了胆的西贡美国侵略军和南朝鲜仆从军，二十一日中午因听到居民燃放春节爆竹，吓得慌作一团，胡乱放枪，互相射击，丑态百出。
    据西方通讯社报道，一个载有南朝鲜仆从军的车队二十一日从西贡大街上驶过的时候，忽然听到一阵爆竹轰响声，车上的十几个形同惊弓之鸟的士兵以为自己受到袭击，立刻向附近树林和建筑物胡乱放枪。这时，从对面方向开来的一卡车美国兵，听到枪声也以为他们要遭到越南人民的惩罚，也慌慌张张跳下车来，向树林射击。美联社的消息说，在一片混乱中，美军和南朝鲜军队还互相开枪射击。一大片地区都实行警戒。
