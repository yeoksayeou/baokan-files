    Emphasize Politics, Enthusiastically Cultivate New Literary and Artistic Talents
    Lin Xiwu, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Ningjin County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shandong Province
    Since 1958, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's direction on literature and art, and under the direct leadership of the higher-level Party committees, we have continuously mobilized and organized the vast number of cadres and masses to carry out mass amateur creative activities in response to the development of the revolutionary situation and the needs of the struggle tasks. At present, there are more than 620 clubs in our county that regularly carry out amateur creative activities. Townships such as Changguan, Chengguan, Shuangque, and Mengji have also established creative guidance stations. Under the direct leadership of the township Party committees, they assist the creative activities of the masses. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 500 amateur writers throughout the county who regularly provide singing materials to clubs, write literary articles for blackboards and wall newspapers, and write articles for provincial and national newspapers, magazines, and radio stations. In addition to some grassroots cadres, the vast majority of these amateur writers are workers and peasants fighting on the front lines of industrial and agricultural production, many of whom are activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, advanced workers, and "Five-Good" commune members. Based on their positions, they love their jobs, sing the praises of advanced figures and advanced deeds in their positions, and actively serve the class struggle and production struggle in their positions. Their literary works, such as novels, reportage, stories, and poems, are disseminated through propaganda tools such as radio stations and blackboards, and have played a certain role in promoting the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and in inspiring the revolutionary drive and labor enthusiasm of the masses.
    To better carry out mass amateur literary creation activities, we must vigorously cultivate amateur writers, especially cultivate the backbone of amateur writers. In our practical work, we have started from the following aspects.
    First, we have realized that to cultivate amateur writers, we must adhere to putting politics in command, that is, adhere to putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, and educate amateur writers to consciously, regularly, and earnestly study Chairman Mao's works. We require amateur writers to focus on studying articles such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." By studying these articles, we enable them to understand the principle of creating for the revolution and establish the idea that creation is doing revolution. In the study, we emphasize following the principles of "studying with problems, studying and applying flexibly, combining study and application, studying what is urgently needed first, and seeing immediate results" put forward by Comrade Lin Biao, and focusing on learning in light of the problems that exist in their thinking and creation. For example, the peasant amateur writer Zhang Changsen was initially very enthusiastic about writing, but in his creation he often failed to grasp the essence of life and tended to fabricate stories and pursue flowery words. We guided him to study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and the Communiqué of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, focusing on helping him solve the problem of observing, analyzing, and reflecting life from a class point of view. Since then, his creation has made great progress. Yu Zhonghui, a statistician at the Baodian Supply and Marketing Cooperative, originally thought that statistics work was boring and there was nothing to write about. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he realized that all work is doing revolution, and his work enthusiasm and creative enthusiasm were both improved, and he wrote "There is a Story Behind the Numbers."
    Second, consciously organize amateur writers to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers in struggle, so that they maintain close contact with workers, peasants, and soldiers. For cadre and staff amateur writers, we often organize them to go to the countryside and go deep into the front lines. Before 1961, Guo Chengqing's works did not have a strong sense of life, which was related to his long stay in the office and his infrequent trips to the countryside. Therefore, we arranged for him to serve as the deputy secretary of Shiji Township for half a year. In 1963, we arranged for him to follow the deputy secretary of the county party committee to squat at the Xinji Brigade of Zhangzhai Township for a year. In 1964, he also participated in the rural socialist education movement. In the struggle, he improved his ideological level and accumulated life experience, and wrote better works such as "Township Party Secretary," "Black Shopkeeper," "Shemi," and "The Biography of Shemi." In addition, consciously organize amateur writers such as Lü Junjun, Zhang Huo, Zhang Xianheng, Chi Huaxuan, and Liu Junliang to regularly do central work, and let them participate in the rural socialist education movement for two consecutive periods. The backbone writers among the cadres generally spend one-third to one-half of their time each year going deep into the grassroots. For peasant amateur writers, educate them to actively participate in rural political activities and collective production, and first be good laborers. Among the sixteen worker-peasant backbone amateur writers, twelve are production team cadres, and they are all activists in various political movements and production labor. Worker writer Xing Shuzhi has been rated as an advanced producer for five consecutive years. Peasant writers Zhang Changsen, Han Chengren, Meng Jiqing, Qu Lianquan, and Yang Guisheng are all "Five-Good" commune members. Zhang Changsen, in 1963 and 1964, actually participated in labor for 270 to 280 days each year, excluding going out to meetings. Meng Jiqing actually participated in labor for more than 300 days in 1964.
    Third, find out the political and ideological situation and the work and labor performance of amateur writers, grasp the living thoughts, grasp the ideological trends, grasp the ideological development laws according to different situations, and help them solve ideological problems in a timely manner. Some authors study hard for several years, but have not written better works, and lack confidence. At this time, we point out their progress and achievements and encourage them to continue their efforts. Some authors have found a little trick in creation, and have written several better works, and often produce a sense of pride. At this time, we help them summarize their creation with a one-divided-into-two point of view, and see their shortcomings. And point out the dangers of pride and complacency. The young peasant writer Han Chengren, for a period of time, did not actively reflect the three great revolutionary movements, but instead spent his energy on describing some unhealthy love stories. We sent comrades from the business department to talk to him and pointed out that his creative direction was not right. At the same time, at the author symposium held in the Cultural Center, we let everyone discuss Han Chengren's works on the basis of studying Chairman Mao's works, so that he received help from everyone. Because we firmly grasped the ideological education of the authors, we eliminated their wrong thoughts in the bud. However, once an ideological problem is solved, new ideological problems will arise, and some ideological problems cannot be solved all at once. Therefore, the political and ideological work of the authors must be grasped at all times, in all places, and be discovered and solved at any time.
    In the work of cultivating amateur writers, we also adopted the working method of grasping typical examples, focusing on cultivation, and driving the general. There are many amateur writers, and it is impossible to manage each one individually, and to manage each one specifically. Therefore, we select typical examples from amateur writers, focus on cultivation, and through grasping typical examples, we can gain experience, guide the work of carrying out mass amateur creation and cultivating amateur writers, and we can also set an example for amateur writers, and play the role of setting up benchmarks.

    突出政治，热情培养文艺新人
    中共山东省宁津县委宣传部长　林希武
    一九五八年以来，在党中央和毛主席的文艺方向的指引下，在上级党委的直接领导下，随着革命形势的发展和斗争任务的需要，我们不断发动和组织广大干部、群众，开展了群众性的业余创作活动。目前，我县开展业余创作活动较经常的俱乐部有六百二十多个。长官、城关、双确、孟集等公社，还成立了创作指导站。在公社党委的直接领导下，辅导群众的创作活动。据初步统计，全县经常为俱乐部提供演唱材料，为黑板报、墙报写文艺稿件，并为省、全国性报刊、电台写稿的业余作者有五百多人。这批业余作者，除一部分是基层干部以外，绝大部分是战斗在工农业生产第一线的工人和农民，其中很多是学习毛主席著作的积极分子、先进工作者、五好社员。他们立足本岗位，热爱本岗位的工作，歌唱本岗位的先进人物和先进事迹，积极为本岗位的阶级斗争和生产斗争服务。他们创作的小说、报告文学、故事、诗歌等文学作品，通过广播站、黑板报等宣传工具加以传播，在促进兴无灭资的斗争，鼓舞群众的革命干劲和劳动热情等方面，都起了一定的作用。
    要更好地开展群众业余文学创作活动，必须大力培养业余作者，特别是培养业余作者中的骨干。我们在实际工作中，是从以下几方面着手的。
    首先，我们体会到，培养业余作者，要坚持政治挂帅，就是坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，教育业余作者自觉地、经常地、认真地学习毛主席著作。我们要求业余作者重点学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《愚公移山》等文章。通过学习这些文章，使他们懂得为革命而创作的道理，树立创作是干革命的思想。在学习中，我们强调遵照林彪同志提出的“带着问题学、活学活用、学用结合、急用先学、立竿见影”的原则，根据自己思想上创作上存在的问题，有的放矢地进行学习。如农民业余作者张长森，开始写作热情很高，但在创作中往往抓不住生活的本质问题，存在着编造故事、追求华丽词句等偏向。我们便指导他学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》和党的八届十中全会公报，集中地帮助他解决用阶级观点观察生活、分析生活、反映生活的问题。此后，他的创作有了很大的进步。保店供销社统计员余忠惠，原来认为统计工作枯燥，没啥可写，学习毛主席著作后，认识到一切工作都是干革命，工作积极性和创作积极性都提高了，写出了《数子背后有文章》。
    第二，有意识地组织业余作者深入工农兵斗争生活，使他们和工农兵保持密切的联系。对于干部、职工业余作者，经常组织他们下乡，深入第一线。一九六一年以前，郭澄清的作品生活气息不是很浓，这和他长期蹲机关、下乡较少有关系。于是，我们便安排他到时集公社兼任公社副书记半年。一九六三年又安排他跟县委副书记到张宅公社辛集大队蹲点一年。一九六四年又让他参加了农村社会主义教育运动。在斗争中提高了他的思想水平，积累了生活，写出了《公社书记》、《黑掌柜》、《社迷》、《社迷传》等较好的作品。此外，有意识地组织吕俊君、张或、张宪恒、迟华轩、刘俊良等业余作者，经常去做中心工作，并连续两期让他们参加农村的社会主义教育运动。干部中的骨干作者，一般的每年有三分之一到二分之一的时间深入基层。对于农民业余作者，教育他们积极参加农村的政治活动和集体生产，首先做一个好的劳动者。在十六名工农骨干业余作者中，有十二名是生产队的干部，他们都是各项政治运动中和生产劳动中的积极分子。工人作者邢树枝，连续五年被评为先进生产者。农民作者张长森、韩成仁、孟吉庆、曲连泉、杨桂升等都是五好社员。张长森在一九六三年和一九六四年，除外出开会外，每年实际参加劳动二百七八十天。孟吉庆一九六四年实际参加劳动三百多天。
    第三，摸清业余作者的政治思想情况及工作、劳动表现，根据不同情况，抓活的思想，抓思想动态，抓思想发展规律，帮助他们及时解决思想问题。有的作者刻苦学习几年，没有写出较好的作品，信心不足。这时，我们就指出他们的进步和成绩，鼓励他们继续努力。有的作者在创作上摸到了一点门路，写了几篇较好的作品，又往往产生骄傲情绪，这时，我们就帮助他们用一分为二的观点总结自己的创作，看到自己的不足之处。并指出骄傲自满的危害性。青年农民作者韩成仁，有个时期，不去积极反映三大革命运动，却把精力用在描写一些不健康的爱情故事上。我们便派业务部门的同志找他谈话，指出他的创作方向不对头。同时，在文化馆召开的作者座谈会上，让大家在学习毛主席著作的基础上，讨论韩成仁的作品，使他得到了大伙的帮助。由于抓紧了对作者的思想教育，就使他们的错误思想消灭在萌芽时期。但是，一个思想问题解决了，又会产生新的思想问题，而有的思想问题，又不是一下子就能解决的。因而对作者的政治思想工作，必须时时抓，处处抓，随时发现，随时加以解决。
    在培养业余作者的工作中，我们还采用了抓典型，重点培养，带动一般的工作方法。业余作者很多，不能个个都管，个个都管得具体，因而，便在业余作者中选择典型，重点培养，通过抓典型，可以取得经验，指导开展群众业余创作和培养业余作者的工作，还可以为业余作者树榜样，起到插标立点的作用。
