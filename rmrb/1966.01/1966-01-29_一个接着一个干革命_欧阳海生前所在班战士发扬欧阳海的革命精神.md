    The soldiers of the Seventh Platoon, Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, where the great communist fighter Ouyang Hai served before his death, have made rapid progress in all aspects over the past two years under the slogan of studying Chairman Mao's works like Ouyang Hai and wholeheartedly engaging in revolution. All nine soldiers in the platoon were rated as "Five-Good Soldiers." Among them, seven soldiers became sharpshooters, five soldiers joined the Party, and three soldiers joined the League. They have been awarded the title of "Four-Good Platoon" for two consecutive years. Leaders and the masses praised them as a "Four-Good Platoon with red ideology, excellent skills, and tough style."

    In Ouyang Hai's Post
    Speaking of the platoon's progress, the soldiers all praised the current platoon leader, Qiu Chengbao, as a red leader like Martyr Ouyang Hai. After Communist Party member Qiu Chengbao took over Ouyang Hai's post, he placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, just like the old platoon leader when he was alive. At first, a few soldiers were worried about their low level of education and lacked confidence in learning. Qiu Chengbao pointed to the soldiers one by one and asked, "How many years have you studied?" Some answered junior high school, some said senior elementary school, junior elementary school. Qiu Chengbao then asked everyone, "How many years did Ouyang Hai study?" Everyone said, "Two years!" Why could he become a communist fighter? Because he had a high level of awareness and truly acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings! Then, Qiu Chengbao took out the Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong that Ouyang Hai carried with him when he sacrificed himself to save the train and let everyone discuss it and compare themselves with Ouyang Hai to find their shortcomings. Everyone felt very ashamed, that everyone was more educated than Ouyang Hai, why couldn't they study hard like the old platoon leader? Therefore, all the comrades in the platoon proposed to regard Chairman Mao's works as the highest instruction and to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way.

    When undertaking construction tasks, platoon leader Qiu Chengbao always requested the most difficult tasks and shouldered heavy burdens like Ouyang Hai. Once, when repairing a road, some sections had loose soil, and some had rocky and hard soil. The entire platoon chose the most difficult section to work on. When removing slag from the work surface, platoon leader Qiu Chengbao always placed the soldiers in safe areas first, and then he went in to eliminate the dangers himself, knocking down pieces of rock that had been blasted but not yet fallen. After a thorough inspection to ensure that there was no danger, he would call the soldiers in to work.

    Engage in Revolution Like Ouyang Hai
    Ouyang Hai's former comrade-in-arms, Li Fuxian, is currently the only one left in the Seventh Platoon. Li Fuxian will never forget how Ouyang Hai helped him make progress. In the spring of 1963, Li Fuxian was assigned to the Seventh Platoon of the Third Company after enlisting in the army. Platoon leader Ouyang Hai cared for him like a younger brother. Ouyang Hai often explained to him word by word articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," connecting them with reality and teaching him little by little to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    Since Ouyang Hai's glorious sacrifice, Li Fuxian, like Ouyang Hai, has always strictly demanded himself. In shooting training, he crawled and rolled all day long, his back ached, and his legs hurt, but his live ammunition shooting results were not good. He studied "Serve the People" with questions in mind. Chairman Mao said: "When our comrades are in difficulty, we must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." He gained strength and confidence from it and continued to practice hard. His elbows were worn away several layers of skin and were covered with thick calluses. Finally, he skillfully mastered the shooting skills and won the honor of sharpshooter.

    Li Fuxian also often patiently helped new comrades. At the beginning of last year, several new comrades were added to the platoon, and he and Lin Deyao formed a "one-help-one, one-pair-red" relationship. At first, Xiao Lin couldn't get used to the tense life of a soldier and asked to be a cook. Li Fuxian helped Xiao Lin in the same way that Ouyang Hai had helped him in the first place. He repeatedly explained to Xiao Lin Chairman Mao's two articles, "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and told him about Ouyang Hai's communist spirit. At the same time, Li Fuxian also told him about Chairman Mao's paragraph on how to treat work in the article "On the Chongqing Negotiations." He wanted him to think about it, asking to be a cook because he was afraid of the tense life in the platoon. How does this conform to Chairman Mao's teachings? Then, Li Fuxian cared for him in life and patiently and specifically helped him in his work, so that he quickly settled down. From then on, Xiao Lin made up his mind to engage in revolution like Ouyang Hai.

    Advancing in the Footsteps of My Brother
    "Advancing in the footsteps of my brother," Ouyang Hai's younger brother, Ouyang Hu, came to the army with such aspirations. On November 18, 1964, the first anniversary of Ouyang Hai's glorious sacrifice, the martyr's father, Elder Ouyang Hengwen, personally sent his fourth son, Ouyang Hu, to the company where the martyr served before his death. He said: To engage in revolution is to continue one after another. Ouyang Hu also said that he would inherit his third brother's will and carry the revolution through to the end.

    In the year since Ouyang Hu enlisted in the army, he has strictly demanded himself, taking Ouyang Hai as an example in everything. He has made rapid progress and has been rated as a "Five-Good Soldier" every month. Like Ouyang Hai, Ouyang Hu has done many good deeds after arriving in the army without ever publicizing them. No matter whose clothes were dirty, he secretly took them to wash them clean. If the toilet was dirty, he quietly cleaned it. When he returned to the dormitory after going off duty at night, he always checked the entire platoon to cover everyone with quilts and put down mosquito nets; when a comrade was sick, he took the initiative to deliver food and water.

    Ouyang Hu not only worked diligently and was eager to help others in the company, but he also paid attention to doing good deeds for the masses in the garrison area. Whenever he had free time, he often went to the local production team to help accumulate fertilizer, transplant rice seedlings, and level the land. When the local masses learned that he was Ouyang Hai's younger brother, they all said in unison: "No wonder he loves the people so much."

    Ouyang Hu deeply understands: "To take over my brother's class well, we must first study Chairman Mao's works well." Although he has only studied a few articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," he always learns a little, remembers a little, and uses a little. After learning, he conscientiously acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions and does things in a down-to-earth manner. Once, six soldiers in the entire platoon worked together to lift a stone weighing four or five hundred catties onto a truck. When it was half a foot away from the truck opening, a soldier suddenly couldn't hold on, and the big stone was about to fall, which was very dangerous. At this time, Ouyang Hu flashed his body and quickly drilled under the stone, supporting the stone with his shoulders and arms. The new soldier Lin Deyao also squatted down and supported it with his shoulders, finally loading the stone onto the truck, ensuring safety. Ouyang Hu has honorably joined the Communist Party and has been awarded a third-class merit.

    Not long after Ouyang Hu came to the company, he caught up with live ammunition shooting. He barely passed the first time he shot the target. He was so anxious that he couldn't sleep well for several nights. He asked himself: American imperialism is slaughtering the Vietnamese people, further expanding the war of aggression, and threatening our country's security. If he doesn't have strong skills, how can he defend the motherland and how can he support the world revolution? Therefore, he practiced early and late, and every small movement was not careless, and he quickly mastered shooting skills.

### 一个接着一个干革命——欧阳海生前所在班战士发扬欧阳海的革命精神

    一个接着一个干革命
    ——欧阳海生前所在班战士发扬欧阳海的革命精神
    伟大的共产主义战士欧阳海生前所在的解放军某部三连七班的战士们，两年来，在象欧阳海那样学习毛主席著作，全心全意干革命的口号下，各方面进步都很快。全班九个人，全部被评为五好战士。其中有七个战士成为特等射手，有五个战士入了党，三个战士入了团，连续两年获得四好班的荣誉。领导和群众赞扬他们是“思想红、技术精、作风硬的四好班”。
    在欧阳海的岗位上
    谈起这个班的进步，战士们都夸现任班长邱成保和欧阳海烈士一样是红色带班人。共产党员邱成保接替了欧阳海的岗位以后，他象老班长在世那样，把学习毛主席著作摆在第一位。起初，少数战士顾虑自己文化低，对学习信心不足。邱成保指着战士们一个个问：“你读了几年书？”有的答初中，有的说高小、初小。邱成保又问大家：“欧阳海读了几年书？”大家说：“两年！”他为什么能成为共产主义战士？因为他觉悟高，真正按毛主席的教导办事！接着，邱成保把欧阳海抢救列车牺牲时带在身上的那本《毛泽东著作选读》拿出来，让大家讨论，对比欧阳海找差距。大家感到很惭愧，谁都比欧阳海文化高，为什么不能象老班长那样刻苦学习呢？于是，全班同志提出把毛主席著作当作最高指示，要坚持不懈活学活用毛主席著作。
    在担负施工任务时，班长邱成保总是要求最艰巨任务，象欧阳海那样拣重担子挑。有次修公路，有土质松软的，也有石头多土质坚硬的，全班选择最困难的地段施工。在作业面排渣时，班长邱成保总是先把战士安置到安全地段，自己冒着危险先进去排除险情，把已经炸开还未掉下的石头，一块块地敲下来，经过周密检查确实没有危险了，才招呼战士们进来干活。
    象欧阳海那样干革命
    欧阳海生前的战友，目前在七班的只剩下共青团员李付仙一个人。李付仙永远不会忘记欧阳海是怎样帮助自己进步的。一九六三年春天，李付仙入伍就分配到三连七班，班长欧阳海象对待小弟弟一样爱护他。欧阳海经常一字一句地给他讲解《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》等文章，联系实际，一点一滴地教他按毛主席的指示办事。
    自从欧阳海光荣牺牲以后，李付仙象欧阳海一样始终严格要求自己。在射击训练中，他整天摸爬滚打，累得腰酸腿痛，可是实弹射击的成绩并不好。他带着问题学习《为人民服务》，毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”他从中获得了力量和信心，又继续苦练下去，双肘磨掉了几层皮，结满了厚茧，终于熟练地掌握了射击技能，获得了特等射手的荣誉。
    李付仙还经常耐心地帮助新同志。去年初，班里补充几个新战友，他和林德耀结成“一帮一、一对红”。小林起初对战士的紧张生活过不惯，要求去当炊事员。李付仙就按照当初欧阳海帮助自己那样来帮助小林。他反复给小林讲解毛主席《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》两篇文章，给他讲欧阳海的共产主义精神。同时，李付仙又把毛主席在《关于重庆谈判》一文中如何对待工作的一段话讲给他听。要他想一想，要求当炊事员是怕过班里的紧张生活，这那里符合毛主席的教导？接着，李付仙又从生活上关心他，工作上耐心具体帮助他，使他很快安下心来。从此，小林下定决心，要象欧阳海那样干革命。
    踏着哥哥的脚印前进
    “踏着哥哥的脚印前进”，欧阳海的弟弟欧阳湖就是怀着这样的志愿来当兵的。一九六四年十一月十八日，在欧阳海光荣牺牲一周年的时候，烈士的父亲欧阳恒文老大伯亲自把四儿子欧阳湖送到烈士生前连队当兵。他说：干革命，就是要一个接着一个。欧阳湖也表示，要继承三哥的遗志，把革命进行到底。
    欧阳湖入伍一年来，处处以欧阳海为榜样，严格要求自己，进步很快，每月都被评为五好战士。欧阳湖和欧阳海一样，到部队后做了许多好事从不声张。不管谁的衣服脏了，他偷偷拿去洗干净，厕所脏了，他悄悄去打扫。晚上下哨回到宿舍，他总要在全排检查一遍，给大家盖被子，放蚊帐；战友病了，他主动地送饭、端水。
    欧阳湖不仅在连队勤勤恳恳，助人为乐，他也很注意为驻地群众做好事。只要有空，他经常到驻地生产队去帮助积肥、插秧、整地。当驻地群众知道他是欧阳海的弟弟，都不约而同地说：“怪不得他这样热爱人民。”
    欧阳湖深深懂得：“要接好哥哥的班，首先要学好毛主席著作。”他虽然只学了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等几篇文章，但他总是学一点，记一点，用一点，学了就认真按毛主席的指示，踏踏实实地做。有一次，全班六个战士合力抬一块四五百斤重大石头装车，离车口还有半尺远，突然有个战士支持不住，大石头摇摇欲坠，非常危险。这时，欧阳湖将身板一闪连忙钻在石头底下，用肩臂顶住石头，新战士林德耀也蹲下去用肩顶住，终于把石头装上车，保证了安全。欧阳湖已光荣加入共产党，并且立了三等功。
    欧阳湖刚来到连队不久，就赶上实弹射击，他第一次打靶勉强及格。为这事，他急得几夜没睡好觉。他问自己：美帝国主义正在屠杀越南人民，进一步扩大侵略战争，威胁着我国安全，自己本领不过硬，凭什么保卫祖国，凭什么支援世界革命？于是，他起早贪黑地练，每个细小动作都不马虎，很快就掌握了射击技术。
