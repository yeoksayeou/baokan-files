    Cannot Settle for "Good Enough," Must Strive for "Excellent"
    What we need to eliminate is not just a simple water drop, but the compromising mindset of "good enough."
    Guo Cunfeng, Production Team Leader, Water Treatment Station, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Works Power Plant
    Our entire station, learning from the revolutionary spirit of Daqing, worked diligently and skillfully for over a year. We disassembled over 300 valves, grinding and repairing each one, finally changing our backward appearance and achieving equipment that does not leak water and a ground that is free of water. Last February, we were even awarded the glorious "Five-Good Equipment" plaque. At that time, only on four filters, from the gland crevices of various valves, a drop of water would still seep out every few hours. We thought: we have already achieved equipment that does not leak water, and a clean ground. It is almost the same as Daqing's "no oil leaks," and one drop of water doesn't hinder anything significant. The problem was exposed on this drop of water.
    Last March, the factory leaders inspected the work of various units and discovered many problems similar to "a drop of water." At first glance, a drop of water is a small matter. Upon careful reflection, "a small hole not mended will become a hole a foot and a half wide." Aren't many large loopholes expanded from small loopholes? Therefore, the factory leaders immediately seized this living thought, repeatedly presenting the facts, reasoning, and criticizing the thinking of seeking only to "get by" and not striving for "excellence." I was shocked when I heard this, and my vision became much clearer. I thought: The people of Daqing have a good spirit, and its goodness lies in their unwavering commitment to excellence. If my own thinking is not unwavering, how can I learn the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing? Everyone also resolved to resolutely and thoroughly revolutionize, and eliminate that drop of water.
    This drop of water is not just an ordinary water drop falling on the table. It's like a child's runny nose; it disappears after being wiped away, only to reappear. It's stubbornly persistent. In the past, everyone had put in a lot of effort, but because the determination was insufficient, we had not eliminated it. Now, everyone, regardless of day shift, night shift, or type of work, is racking their brains to come up with solutions. The gland crevices are leaking, and the main problem is that the packing inside the crevices is not suitable. What material is suitable? First, we tried asbestos rope, but it didn't work. Then we used cotton yarn packing, but it still didn't work. Then we used high-pressure packing and wool felt, but it was still unsuccessful. If it had been in the past, encountering so many hard nails, we would have been discouraged long ago. But now, everyone thinks: The people of Daqing overcame such great difficulties, so what is our difficulty? What we want to eliminate is not just a simple water drop, but the compromising mindset of "good enough." Therefore, the harder the nails, the greater everyone's enthusiasm.
    One night, young worker Li Mingzheng was lying in bed when he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Without understanding the interconnection of things, without understanding the internal laws of things, this method is therefore subjectivism." As he pondered, he suddenly grasped the root cause of not eliminating the drop of water. Thus, he analyzed and studied the characteristics of the equipment, the relationship between the parts, and the performance of the packing, item by item, overnight, finally grasping the law and smoothly coming up with a new packing method. The next day, he and everyone else conducted several days of experiments, and that naughty drop of water never reappeared. The struggle to eliminate a drop of water was very enlightening to me.
    The people of Daqing put "strictness" first, achieving no oil stains above the well and no falling objects below the well. We can only learn from Daqing's "strictness" to achieve not a single drop of water leaking.
    Chairman Mao taught us: What we fear most in everything is a lack of seriousness. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, put effort into the word "seriousness," strategically trample difficulties under our feet, and tactically pay attention to difficulties, working bit by bit and persevering, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. What is eliminating a drop of water?

### 不能“过得去”  必须“过得硬”  我们要除掉的不只是一滴简单的水珠，而是除掉过得去的凑合思想

    不能“过得去”  必须“过得硬”
    我们要除掉的不只是一滴简单的水珠，而是除掉过得去的凑合思想
    马钢动力厂水处理站生产组长  郭存丰
    我们全站同志学大庆革命精神，苦干巧干了一年多，把三百多个阀门拆卸开来，一个个进行了研磨、检修，终于改变了落后面貌，做到了设备不漏水，地面没有水。去年二月，还挂上了光荣的“五好设备”牌。当时，只有四台过滤器上，各种阀门的格栏缝里，每隔几小时还要渗出一滴水珠。我们想：已做到设备不漏水了，地面干净了，和大庆不漏油也差不多了，一滴水嘛，碍不了大事。不想问题就暴露在这滴水上。
    去年三月份，厂领导检查各单位的工作，发现类似一滴水的问题不少。乍一看，一滴水事小，仔细一想，“小洞不补大洞一尺五”，许多大漏洞不就是由小漏洞扩大的么？因此，厂领导马上抓住这个活思想，反复摆事实，讲道理，批判了只求过得去，不求过得硬的思想，我听了大吃一惊，眼光顿时明亮多了。我想：大庆人精神好，好就好在思想过得硬。自己思想不过硬，怎能学好大庆人的革命精神？大家也下定决心要坚决彻底革命，除掉一滴水。
    这滴水，可不是落在桌上的一般水珠。它象小孩的鼻涕，擦掉了又会有，顽固得很。过去，大家也动过不少脑筋，只因决心不够，没有把它除掉。现在大家不分白班、夜班和工种，都苦心想起办法来。格栏缝渗水，主要问题是缝里塞的填料不合适。什么料合适呢？先试验石棉绳，不行。又用棉纱盘根，还是不行。再用高压盘根、羊毛毡，还是不成功。要是在从前，碰到这样多的硬钉子，我们早就灰心了。现在大家却想：大庆人那样大的困难都克服了，我们这点困难又算什么啊！我们要除掉的不只是一滴简单的水珠，而是除掉过得去的凑合思想。因此，钉子越硬，大家的劲头反而更足了。
    一天晚上，青年工人李明政躺在床上，想到了毛主席的教导：“不认识事物的互相联系，不认识事物的内部规律，所以这种方法是主观主义的。”想着想着，他不觉一下子抓住了没有除掉一滴水的病根。于是，便连夜把设备的特性，部件和部件的关系，填料的性能，一项项作了分析研究，终于掌握了规律，顺利地想出了新的填料办法。第二天，他和大家一道进行了几天试验，那滴淘气的水珠，就再也不露面了。除掉一滴水的斗争，对我有很大启发。
    大庆人以“严”字当头，做到井上无油污，井下无落物，我们只有学大庆的“严”字当头，才能做到一滴水不漏。
    毛主席教导我们：凡事就怕认真。我们只要按照毛主席的指示，在“认真”二字上下功夫，在战略上把困难踩在脚下，在战术上又重视困难，做到一点一滴地进行工作，坚持不懈，就没有克服不了的困难，除掉一滴水又算什么呢？
