    According to Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: A group of correspondence teachers from Southwest Agricultural College, carrying teaching tools such as instruments and specimens, as well as teaching materials, have recently been touring the rural areas of more than 20 counties and cities in Chongqing and Chengdu suburbs of Sichuan and Wenjiang Prefecture to train teachers for agricultural middle schools. The masses praised them as "peddlers" on the education front.
    Of the 317 correspondence students majoring in agronomy enrolled by the college last autumn, there are teachers from 139 agricultural middle schools (including a small number of private schools and farm-study primary schools). Most of them are high school graduates who returned to their hometowns in recent years. They lack both practical production knowledge and agricultural scientific theoretical knowledge, and have many difficulties in teaching. In order to help them improve teaching quality and promote the consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools, Southwest Agricultural College has taken this measure.
    Nine teachers from the college, specializing in crop cultivation, crop pests, plant pathology, plant physiology, agricultural meteorology, fertilizers, and chemistry, have gone to the countryside to conduct mobile face-to-face instruction. Each time they arrive in a place, they first visit the county and district cultural and educational departments and agricultural middle school teachers and students, so as to arrange the content of the face-to-face instruction from a practical point of view. Before conducting the face-to-face instruction, the correspondence teachers also visit local veteran farmers and agricultural technicians, and participate in production labor with the commune members to understand the technical requirements and experience of local spring production, sometimes walking dozens of miles to clarify a problem. Combining the actual situation of various places, they focused on teaching the teachers of agricultural middle schools the cultivation techniques, field management, fertilization, and pest and disease control of spring crops from the perspective of scientific theory, helping the teachers of agricultural middle schools to integrate these theoretical knowledge into teaching and production in a thorough and easy-to-understand way, based on the current situation of the local area. The correspondence teachers also try their best to incorporate the current major production measures of various places into the teaching content of the face-to-face instruction. Many agricultural middle school teachers said happily: "This face-to-face instruction is equivalent to preparing us for half a year of classes." More than 160 non-correspondence students learned that this kind of teaching was helpful to them, and they also took the initiative to strive to participate in the lectures.

    教育战线上的“货郎担”
    西南农学院函授教师下乡为农业中学培养师资，很受欢迎
    据新华社重庆电　西南农学院的一批函授教师，挑着仪器、标本等教学用具和教学资料，最近巡回在四川重庆、成都市郊和温江专区的二十多个县市的农村为农业中学培养师资。群众称赞他们是教育战线上的“货郎担”。
    这个学院去年秋季招收的三百一十七名农学专业的函授生中，有一百三十九所农业中学（包括少数民办中学，耕读小学）的教师。他们多数是近几年回乡的高中毕业生，既缺乏生产实践知识，又缺乏农业科学理论知识，在教学工作中有很多困难。西南农学院为帮助他们提高教学质量，促进农业中学的巩固提高，才采取了这一措施。
    这所学院下乡进行农村巡回面授的有作物栽培、作物虫害、植物病理、植物生理、农业气象、肥料、化学等课程的九名教师。他们每到一地就先到县、区文教部门和农业中学教师、学生中访问，以便从实际出发安排面授的内容。函授教师在进行面授前还访问当地老农和农业技术人员，并和社员一道参加生产劳动，了解当地小春生产的技术要求和经验，有时不惜步行几十里去弄清楚一个问题。他们结合各地的实际情况，从科学理论的角度，向农业中学的教师着重讲授了小春作物的栽培技术、田间管理、施肥、防治病虫害等问题，帮助农业中学教师结合当地当前情况，将这些理论知识深入浅出地贯彻到教学和生产工作中去。函授教师对各地当前的重大生产措施，也尽量纳入面授的教学内容。许多农业中学教师高兴地说：“这一次面授等于为我们备了半年课。”有一百六十多名非函授生了解到他们这样教学对自己有帮助，也主动争取参加了听课。
