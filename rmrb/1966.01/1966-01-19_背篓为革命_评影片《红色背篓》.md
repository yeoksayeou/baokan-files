    In the film "The Red Basket," there are two sets of moving flashback scenes that left a deep impression on the audience.
    The first set of flashbacks appears when Wang Fushan, the salesman of Hongshan Store, is carrying goods up Ma'erduo Mountain. In order to solve the problem of farmers in mountainous areas not having time to go to the store to buy things during the busy farming season, Wang Fushan carries daily necessities and production goods up the mountain in a basket. As he struggles to climb the towering Ma'erduo Mountain with the heavy goods on his back, he discovers an abandoned coal kiln by the roadside, which reminds him of his experience of "carrying small kiln" before liberation. At that time, he was only eleven years old, with a small body, bearing a weight beyond his ability, crawling out of the low and damp kiln like a beast of burden. But at the entrance of the cave, the supervisor still complained that he was carrying too little, and beat him mercilessly with a stick. "Who was I carrying for in the past, and who am I carrying for today? Fushan saw the changes of the times from his own basket." Yes, the times have changed, and the nature and significance of labor have also changed. Before liberation, "carrying small kiln" was exploitation by capitalists, so labor became an unbearable drudgery. But today, carrying the basket up the mountain is for the convenience of the masses, it is "carrying the Party's concern for the masses up the mountain," it is serving the people, in a word: carrying the basket for the revolution!
    The second set of flashbacks appears when the poor peasants association chairman, Old Man Yang Tian, tells the story of delivering salt to the Eighth Route Army in the past. Under the leadership of Wang Fushan, Xiao Zhang, a salesman who had just left school, followed him in carrying oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, which were not light, not very profitable, but urgently needed by the commune members, through the torrential rain, to the top of Juchi Ravine. There, Old Man Yang Tian dried their wet clothes for them and invited them to eat. At this time, he pointed to an old basket hanging on the beam of the house and told the two salesmen: how he used it to carry salt to the guerrillas behind the mountain two years before liberation; how his wife pretended to be going back to her mother's house to scout the way for him; and how she heroically sacrificed herself to cover him when they encountered Kuomintang bandits. Old Man Yang Tian then said: "In order to let the children remember this, I have repaired the basket and hung it on this beam." The story told by Old Man Yang Tian is very exciting. From the old basket hanging on the beam, we can see the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle and heroic sacrifice. It educates the next generation; we should firmly remember this glorious tradition and inherit it.
    Fushan's idea of delivering goods up the mountain was not immediately feasible. As soon as he proposed it, he was opposed by Manager Ma and Accountant Sun Qianming. But Fushan was not discouraged by this, he put forward his views at the Party branch meeting. With the support of the Party Committee Secretary of the commune, Manager Ma had to agree to try it.
    The problem of carrying goods up the mountain was solved, but obstacles were encountered in the issue of what goods to carry. Fushan did business for the needs of the commune members, while Manager Ma and Accountant Sun did business for profit. Putting the interests of the masses first, or putting profit first, is the contradiction and struggle between two kinds of business ideologies. This contradiction runs through the entire film, first manifested in Wang Fushan's struggle against the false and fake bourgeois management style of Accountant Sun, and later manifested in the struggle between politics first and indicators first. On this issue, Accountant Sun proposed: "What else should commercial work do if it doesn't make money? We always talk about putting politics in command, putting politics in command, doesn't the achievement of putting politics in command fall on money?" When Xiao Zheng pointed out to him that this idea of profit first was a capitalist management idea, he argued: "...the money earned is entirely for the state, and not taken to one's own home." Here, he ignored the principle that extreme responsibility to the interests of the state must be unified with extreme responsibility to the interests of the people. Fushan said well: "We run commerce to serve production and to serve the people's lives, so it is only correct to talk about indicators under the guidance of the Two Serves ideology." This also illustrates the dialectical relationship between national interests and the interests of the people.
    "The Red Basket" not only reflects the situation of the vast number of commercial workers raising their awareness and implementing revolutionization under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought; it also reflects the situation of the vast number of cadres and workers on various fronts raising their awareness and pushing revolutionization further forward in the upsurge of studying Mao Zedong Thought, because the spirit of the basket should be the embodiment of the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, that is, the embodiment of the idea that all work is for the revolution. This is precisely the political and educational significance of "The Red Basket."
    Comrade Shi Daqian, after "Young Luban," has again directed and created such a timely film that reflects reality, is rich in the spirit of the times and full of revolutionary enthusiasm, which is very gratifying. Although both films still have some shortcomings, the creative tendency is healthy, good, and energetic, and the creative style is solid and simple. I hope that the director can advance step by step along this creative path.

    背篓为革命
    ——评影片《红色背篓》
    欧阳山尊
    在影片《红色背篓》里出现过两组动人的回忆镜头，给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    第一组回忆镜头的出现，是在影片的主人公、红山店的营业员王福山背货上马耳朵山的途中。为了解决山区农民在农忙季节没有工夫到商店去买东西的困难，王福山就用篓子背着生产与生活必需品送上山去。当他背着沉重的货物吃力地朝着高矗入云的马耳朵山爬上去的时候，他发现了山路旁边一个荒废了的煤窑，这使他回忆起解放前在这儿“背小窑”的情形。那时他才十一岁，瘦小的身躯，负荷着超过他力所能及的重量，象牲口一样从低湿的窑里爬出来，可是到了洞口，监工还嫌他背得太少，手里的棍子朝他没头没脑地打下去。“过去为谁去背，今天又是为谁去背？福山从自己的篓子里看到了时代的变化。”是的，时代变了，劳动的性质和劳动的意义也就不同了。在解放前“背小窑”是被资本家剥削，所以劳动就成了一种难以忍受的苦役，可是在今天，背篓上山是为了群众的方便，是“把党对群众的关怀背上山去”，是为人民服务，总的一句话：背篓为革命！
    第二组回忆镜头，是出现在贫协主席杨田老汉讲当年为八路军送盐的故事的时候。在王福山的带动下，出学校门不久的营业员小张跟着他一起背着分量不轻，盈利不大，但却是社员们迫切需要的油盐酱醋，冒着倾盆大雨，送到锯齿沟山顶上去。在那里，杨田老汉为他们烤干了淋湿的衣服并留他们吃饭，就在这个时候，他指着挂在房梁上的一个旧篓子告诉两个营业员：在解放的前两年，他如何用它背着盐给山后的游击队送去；他的妻子又如何装着走娘家的样子在前边给他探路；后来遇到了国民党匪兵，她为了掩护他，又如何壮烈地牺牲了。杨田老汉接着说：“为了让孩子们记住这件事，我把篓子补好了，就挂在这房梁上。”杨老汉讲的故事十分激动人心，从那个挂在房梁上的旧篓子上，可以看到艰苦奋斗英勇牺牲的革命传统，它教育下一代；应该牢牢地记住这个光荣的传统，并且把它继承下来。
    福山提出了送货上山的想法并不是一下就可以行得通的，他一提出来就遭到经理老马和会计孙前明的反对。但是福山并不因此而泄气，他把自己的看法在党支部的会议上提出来。在公社党委书记的支持下，马经理只好答应试试。
    背货上山的问题解决了，可是在背什么货的问题上又遇到了阻碍，福山是为了社员的需要而做生意，马经理和孙会计却是为了盈利而做生意。把群众的利益放在第一位，还是把盈利放在第一位，这是两种经营思想的矛盾和斗争。这一矛盾贯串在整个的影片中，先是表现在王福山对孙会计那种弄虚作假的资产阶级经营作风的斗争上，以后则表现在政治第一还是指标第一的斗争上。在这个问题上孙会计提出：“商业工作不搞钱还搞啥？我们老说政治挂帅，政治挂帅，政治挂帅的成绩不就落在钱上吗？”当小郑向他指出这种利润第一的思想是资本主义经营思想时，他辩解着说：“……赚了钱完全给国家，又不往自己家拿。”在这里，他忽略了极端向国家的利益负责必须与极端向人民的利益负责统一起来这个原则。福山说得好：“我们办商业，就是为了生产服务，为了人民生活服务，所以只有在两为的思想指导下去讲指标才是正确的。”这也正说明了国家利益与人民利益的辩证关系。
    《红色背篓》不但反映了广大商业工作者在毛泽东思想的指导下，提高觉悟，实行革命化的情况；同时也反映了各个战线上的广大干部和职工在学习毛泽东思想的热潮中，提高觉悟、把革命化更推向前进的情况，因为背篓的精神应该是全心全意为人民服务的精神的体现，也就是一切工作都是为了革命这一思想的体现。这也正是《红色背篓》的政治教育意义的所在。
    史大千同志继《青年鲁班》之后，又编导了这样一部及时反映现实，富有时代精神和充满了革命热情的影片，这是十分可喜的。虽然两部片子都还有些不足之处，但创作的倾向是健康的，好的，有朝气的，创作的风格是扎实的，朴素的。希望编导者能沿着这条创作的道路一步一个脚印地向前迈进。
