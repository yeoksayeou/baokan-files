    The Important Role of Aid-Agriculture Archives
    Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Bureau Work Group
    In order to do a better job of supporting agriculture, the "August 1st" Farm Implement Repair and Manufacturing Cooperative in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, created aid-agriculture archives in 1963.
    Aid-agriculture archives are accurate and concise records of relevant agricultural production conditions and the distribution of agricultural machinery. They were collectively created by the staff of the "August 1st" Cooperative based on practical experience. Before 1963, this cooperative had few tasks during the off-season and was overwhelmed during the busy farming season. It often couldn't attend to both local needs and external needs, or attend to one area while neglecting another. The work was very passive. To solve this contradiction, the Party branch and the board of directors mobilized all employees to discuss it. The workers said: Chairman Mao teaches us that we should be "well-informed" when we work, but our support for agriculture lacks clarity and prior preparation. How can we change this situation? Some workers suggested: "Hospitals have medical record bags for patients. Can we establish an archive bag to grasp the situation for supporting agriculture?" Everyone felt that this suggestion was good. Therefore, the board of directors designed a set of registration cards, organized dedicated personnel, and went down to different areas to conduct investigations. They registered the distribution and damage of cultivated land, soil, crops, labor, draught animals, medium-sized farm implements, and agricultural machinery in each commune and production team in the service area. They established two types of archives for each production team: "Basic Agricultural Conditions" and "Agricultural Machinery Distribution." Thus, aid-agriculture archives were born.
    In order to make good use of aid-agriculture archives, the "August 1st" Cooperative adopted the following methods:
    Diligent Investigation. Since 1963, they have consistently conducted typical investigations and conducted a comprehensive survey of basic agricultural conditions once a year and a survey of agricultural machinery once a season, so that the archives can always accurately reflect objective conditions.
    Extensive Analysis and Research. When they first started the archives, they were relatively cumbersome, with fourteen types of archives. Later, after multiple rounds of refinement, they were consolidated into two types, achieving concentrated content that was concise and to the point. They also used charts to mark the archives, frequently familiarizing themselves, constantly researching, and consulting them at any time.
    Arrange Production and Guide Production Based on the Archives. They rely on the archives as an important basis for arranging annual and quarterly production, or for producing a certain item for a certain production team. For example, when the Xiangshanzhuang Brigade needed steel shovels, they looked at the archives, knew the number of strong laborers in the team, and produced eighteen steel shovels according to the actual situation. When the workers delivered the steel shovels to the team, the commune members said, "We didn't tell you, but you already knew how many we needed."
    Check the Archives Beforehand, File After the Event. When repairing machines for production teams, they first checked the model, horsepower, specifications, service life, and vulnerable parts of the machine from the archives; after the machine was repaired, they recorded the damage situation and cause, as well as the repair results, in the archives.
    Since the establishment of aid-agriculture archives, the "August 1st" Cooperative has played an important role in promoting work. The main changes are "four transformations":
    Transforming from Passive to Active. In the past, the work was often passively busy and chaotic. Now, through the archives, they have mastered the basic situation of each commune and team, and have achieved early planning and early production, "one step proactive, every step proactive," "one step ahead, every step ahead." For example, from the Spring Equinox to Grain Rain is the busy season for spring plowing, so they prepare the agricultural tools needed by farmers for land preparation, sowing, etc., before the Spring Equinox; during the Minor Full and Grain in Ear, they prepare the agricultural tools needed for the "Three Summers" of wheat harvesting and field management of autumn crops; before White Dew and Autumn Equinox, they prepare the agricultural tools needed for wheat planting and autumn harvest; before the Beginning of Winter, they prepare the tools needed for winter farmland capital construction and soil and water conservation, and water conservancy projects. In terms of strength, they divide areas for contracting and make reasonable arrangements. During the busy farming season, they use 70% of their strength for repair and assembly, and during the off-season, they use 70% of their strength for manufacturing. For several years, they have maintained a situation of not being slack in the off-season, being normal in the busy season, not violating the farming season, and actively supporting agriculture.
    Transforming from Uniformity to Adapting to Local Conditions. For example, with plowshares, in the past, due to a lack of understanding of the cultivation habits and soil conditions of various places, only one specification was produced, which could not meet the needs of production. Once, when they sent ox-tongue plowshares to the production team, the masses returned them. Later, according to the soil conditions of various regions recorded in the archives, they produced nine different specifications of plowshares in different quantities, such as "Tang" plowshares for clay soils and "Tian" plowshares for sandy soils, which were welcomed by farmers.
    Transforming from Sitting in the Shop Waiting for Customers to "Sending Umbrellas Before the Rain." Before the establishment of the archives, they did not know the quantity and variety specifications of agricultural tools needed by each commune and team, so after producing agricultural tools, they mostly waited for farmers to come to the door to buy them. After having the archives, in order to facilitate the farmers, they often took the initiative to go up the mountains and down to the countryside to deliver goods to their doorsteps, achieving "sending umbrellas before the rain." In the process of delivering agricultural tools, they also promoted and implemented the "warranty, return, exchange, and technical teaching" four-guarantee system to farmers.
    Transforming from Blind Repair and Assembly to Planned Patrol Repair and Assembly. In the past, they repaired whatever they encountered, inspected temporarily, and assembled parts temporarily, resulting in more lost work and slower progress. Since operating according to the distribution and use of agricultural machinery in each commune and team in the archives, this phenomenon has been overcome. They prepared 30% of the parts in advance, so that they could be repaired and assembled at any time; they also implemented a system of minor inspections of agricultural machinery for production teams once a month, major inspections every three months, and advance inspections according to the farming season. Down-to-earth repairs are not blindly running around, but go to where there is machinery according to the archives.
    The reason why the "August 1st" Farm Implement Cooperative was able to create aid-agriculture archives and do a better job is mainly that all employees, under the leadership of the Party branch, have creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, used Mao Zedong Thought to take command, and established a fiery red heart for serving the farmers and supporting agriculture for the revolution. They think of production everywhere, and they believe that only by understanding agriculture can they effectively and comprehensively support agriculture. The aid-agriculture archives were created on this ideological basis.

    援农档案的重要作用
    山西省手工业管理局工作组
    山西省闻喜县八一农具修造合作社，为了把支援农业的工作做的更好，在一九六三年创建了援农档案。
    援农档案就是农业生产中有关的情况和农机具分布情况的真实简明的记录。它是八一社职工根据实践中的体会，集体创造出来的。这个社在一九六三年以前，一到淡季活不多，一到农忙季节就忙得不可开交。常常是顾了家里，顾不了外头，顾了这个地方，顾不了那个地方。工作很被动。为了解决这个矛盾，党支部和理事会发动全体职工进行讨论。工人们说：毛主席教导我们，做工作应当“胸中有数”，而我们支援农业恰恰是底子不清，事前无准备。怎样改变这种情况呢？有的工人提出：“医院看病有个病历袋，我们支援农业是否可以建立一个掌握情况的档案袋呢？”大家感到这个意见提的好。于是，理事会设计了一套登记卡片，组织专人，分片下去进行调查。把服务区里各公社生产队的耕地、土壤、种植作物、劳力、使役牲畜、中型农具、农业机械的分布和损坏情况，一一登记。以生产队为单位，分别建立“农业基本情况”和“农机具分布情况”两种档案。援农档案就这样诞生了。
    为了把援农档案用好，八一社采取的办法是：
    勤调查。从一九六三年以来，他们一直坚持搞典型调查并对农业基本情况一年普查一次，农机具一季调查一次的方法，使档案经常能准确地反映客观情况。
    多分析研究。开始搞档案时比较繁琐，搞了十四种档案，后来经过多次去粗取精，整理为两种，达到内容集中，简明扼要。并用图表的形式把档案标示出来，经常熟悉，不断研究，随时查考。
    根据档案来安排生产，指导生产。他们安排年度生产和季度生产，或给某一个生产队生产一种什么东西，都以档案作为重要依据。例如，香山庄大队需要钢锹用，他们一看档案知道了这个队强劳力的数目，就按实际情况给生产了十八张钢锹。工人把钢锹送到队里，社员们说：“我们没告诉你们，你们就知道我们要多少”。
    事前查档，事后归档。给生产队修理机器时，事先从档案中查考这个机器的型号、马力、规格、使用年限、易损部件；在机器修理好以后，又把这个机器的损坏情况和原因及修理结果，记入档案。
    八一社自援农档案建立以来，对工作起了重要的促进作用。主要的有“四变”：
    变被动为主动。过去工作经常被动忙乱。现在通过档案，掌握了各社队的基本情况，作到了早安排、早生产，“一步主动，步步主动”，“一步领先，步步领先”。比如，春分到谷雨是春耕生产紧张时期，就在春分以前把农民需要的整地、播种等农具如数准备好；在小满、芒种期间，就把“三夏”所需要的小麦收打和秋作物的田间管理农具准备好；在白露、秋分以前，就把种麦和秋收所需要的农具准备好；在立冬以前，就把冬季农田基本建设和水土保持，兴修水利等工具准备好。在力量上，分片包干，合理安排。农忙时，用百分之七十的力量搞修配，农闲时，用百分之七十的力量搞制造。几年来一直保持着淡季不淡，旺季正常，不违农时，主动支援的局面。
    变千篇一律为因地制宜。如犁铧，过去由于对各地的耕作习惯和土壤情况不甚了解，只生产了一种规格，不能适应生产的需要。有一次把牛舌铧送到生产队，群众又退回来了。后来，根据档案上记载的各个地区的土壤情况，生产了不同数量的九种不同规格的犁铧，如粘土地生产有镗字铧；沙土地生产有天字铧等等，受到了农民的欢迎。
    变坐店等客为“雨前送伞”。没有建立档案时，不知道各社队需要农具的数量和品种规格，所以生产农具以后，多半是等农民找上门来买，有了档案后，为了方便农民，就经常主动上山下乡，送货上门，做到了“雨前送伞”。在送农具过程中，还向农民宣传并实行了“保修、保退、保换、保教技术”的四保制度。
    变盲目修配为有计划地巡回修配。过去是遇到什么修什么，临时检查，临时配件，误工多，进度慢。自从根据档案上各社队农机具分布与使用情况办事以后，这种现象克服了。在平时就准备好了百分之三十的配件，作到随修随配；还实行了给生产队的农机具一月一小检修，三个月一大检修，按农时提前检修的制度。下乡检修也不是盲目瞎跑，而是按照档案什么地方有机具，就到什么地方去检修。
    八一农具社所以能够创立援农档案，把工作做得更好，主要是全体职工在党支部的领导下，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想挂帅，树立了一颗火热的为农民服务、为革命而支援农业的红心。他们处处为生产着想，他们认为只有了解农业才能有效地和全面地支援农业。在这种思想基础上创造了援农档案。
