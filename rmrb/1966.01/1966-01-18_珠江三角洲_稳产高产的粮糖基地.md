    Pearl River Delta - A Stable and High-Yield Grain and Sugar Base
    The West River, North River, and East River, with their long histories, converge in central and southern Guangdong, splitting into hundreds of river branches like a net. These three rivers carry large amounts of sediment, depositing it here to form a large plain of 19,800 square kilometers.
    This is the Pearl River Delta.
    The main part of the Pearl River Delta includes eleven counties and three cities, namely: Nanhai, Panyu, Shunde, Xinhui, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Doumen counties, and Foshan and Jiangmen cities, all under the Foshan Special District; Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Bao'an counties under the Huiyang Special District; as well as Hua County and Guangzhou City. The eleven counties and three cities have a total cultivated area of 7.79 million mu, of which 6.47 million mu are paddy fields, with an agricultural population of 4.8 million.

      The Prosperous and Rich "Guangdong Granary"
    Since liberation, the broad masses of peasants in the Pearl River Delta, under the leadership of the Party, have adhered to the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, carrying out a large-scale struggle to transform nature. They have now basically built the Pearl River Delta into a large-area, stable, and high-yield commodity grain and commodity sugar crop base in our country.
    Today's Pearl River Delta is filled with the giant strides of socialist construction.
    On both sides of the crisscrossing river branches, solid dikes stretch out like winding dragons. These dikes are generally five to ten meters high and ten to twenty or thirty meters wide at the base. At the confluence of many river branches, water gates stand tall. The water gates are connected to the dikes, forming a copper wall and iron bastion more than 10,000 kilometers long, protecting millions of mu of fertile farmland. It has withstood the test of typhoons and floods many times.
    The sky over the Pearl River Delta now features a modern and large-scale power grid. Iron towers stand tall in the wilderness, carrying rows of high-voltage transmission lines. This high-voltage power grid is over 5,400 kilometers long, connecting more than 3,800 electric irrigation and drainage stations with a total installed capacity of 182,000 kilowatts. With these pumping stations, the current Pearl River Delta, even if it encounters a torrential rain of two to three hundred millimeters in a day, can drain the waterlogged areas within three or four days; if there is no rain for six or seven consecutive months, it can ensure the normal water needs of the paddy fields.
    With the stable increase in crop production, the Pearl River Delta is playing an increasingly significant role as the "Guangdong Granary," making more and more contributions to our country's socialist construction. According to statistics from the seven counties and two cities of Foshan Special District alone, in 1965, it provided 1.5 billion jin of commodity grain and 4.6 billion jin of commodity sugarcane. In 1965, the amount of commodity grain provided by Panyu County was more than the total grain output in 1949. There are also many communes in the Pearl River Delta that provide more than 10 million jin of commodity grain each year, and brigades that provide more than one million jin. The Minzhong Commune and Gangkou Commune in Zhongshan County provide more than 50 million jin of commodity grain each year. In addition, the farmers of the Pearl River Delta provide the state with large quantities of silkworm cocoons, pond fish, jute, fruits, and vegetables every year. At the same time, they also retain enough materials for expanding reproduction. In 1965, the food ration for each agricultural person was more than 500 jin, and many production teams and members had grain reserves.
    However, before liberation, the Pearl River Delta was a place plagued by floods, waterlogging, wind, tides, drought, and salinity. Every year during the flood season, the West River, North River, and East River would pour in with flows of tens of thousands of cubic meters per second. As a result, rivers overflowed everywhere, and floods raged. The collapse of dikes, the destruction of farmland, the flooding of houses, crop failures, and people fleeing famine happened almost every year. According to records, from the beginning of the twentieth century to 1949, there were thirty-six major flood disasters. At that time, the farmers in the silt land (shatian) area, who suffered from both class exploitation and natural disasters, all had a small boat. When the floods came, people rowed their small boats, and the whole family drifted around. There was no hope for crops, and people had no fixed abode. At that time, the Pearl River Delta, the so-called "Guangdong Granary," could not produce enough grain to feed itself and had to rely on foreign rice every year. In the early days of liberation, the state had to supply a portion of grain to this area every year.

          Copper Walls and Iron Bastions Lock Away the Floods
    Today's prosperous and rich Pearl River Delta was built on a devastated and broken foundation. At the time of liberation in 1949, the Pearl River Delta had just undergone a flood, the land was ruined, and there was mourning everywhere. The then CCP Pearl River Regional Committee and the relevant county committees studied the disaster situation and believed that floods were the biggest natural disaster in the Pearl River Delta. They decided to organize the farmers of the delta to repair dikes and prevent floods.
    For the farmers of the Pearl River Delta, who had suffered from water disasters for generations, repairing dikes was a strong desire. They said: Dikes are our lifeline. The old society left us these broken dikes, which made us suffer enough. We can no longer pass on the suffering to the next generation. The Party leads us to repair dikes, no question, we will do it resolutely! As a result, hundreds of thousands of people went to the construction site, digging and carrying mud all year round, building dikes. From the winter of 1949 to the spring of 1953, the farmers of the delta contributed thirty to forty million labor days, moved thirty to forty million cubic meters of earth, and repaired all three to four thousand dikes, more than 10,000 kilometers of dike lines.
    However, the newly built dikes during this period were not strong enough. Every year when the floods came, some collapsed, and some were in danger. Dikes were repaired every year, accidents occurred every year, and dikes were blocked every year. As a result, some people developed a fear of difficulties and said: "The older generation did not repair the dikes well, and we may not be able to repair them well either."
    In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels continuously strengthened ideological and political work, repeatedly educating the masses: Repairing so many and so long dikes in the Pearl River Delta is not a matter of one or two years, or three or five years. We must have the determination to not be afraid of hardship and struggle for a long time. At the same time, Party committees at all levels further studied water management strategies. They analyzed the then distribution of dikes and the patterns of floods in recent years and made a new plan for repairing dikes and preventing floods. After this, each county systematically carried out the project of connecting dikes and building gates. In five years, the farmers of the Pearl River Delta moved one to two hundred million cubic meters of earth, connecting thousands of scattered small dikes into hundreds of solid large dikes.
    While fighting against floods, the farmers in the silt land area of the Pearl River Delta also carried out another very arduous farmland capital construction project—adding mud to the silt land.
    The Pearl River Delta near the river estuaries has millions of mu of low-lying silt land that is one or two feet lower than the river water level and is submerged in water all year round, resulting in very low yields. In order to transform these low-lying areas, the farmers of the delta took a three-pronged approach, scooping up river mud from the river branches and spreading it on the fields. This both raised the field surface, added fertilizer to the lean soil, and dredged the river channels. For more than ten years, every winter and spring, tens of thousands of boats in the water network area of the Pearl River Delta have been scooping mud and spreading it on the fields. Now, hundreds of thousands of mu of low-lying fields have been raised by five inches to one foot, and the total amount of river mud that has been dug exceeds 500 million cubic meters.

          Electric Irrigation and Drainage Resists Drought and Flooding
    The ferocious floods were initially tamed in front of the people. During the flood season every year, dikes no longer breached.
    However, the pace of the Pearl River Delta farmers' struggle against nature did not stop. Because although the floods no longer raged, once the rainy season arrived, the river water level rose sharply, and the waterlogged water inside the dikes could not be drained, forming waterlogging disasters. Every time waterlogging occurred, tens of thousands of people would crank tens of thousands of waterwheels, drawing water day and night. Despite this, the seedlings still suffered to varying degrees.
    In 1959, the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to build the Pearl River Delta into a large-area, stable, and high-yield commodity grain base, strengthening the leadership over the Pearl River Delta in all aspects. One of the specific measures was to help the Pearl River Delta build an electric irrigation and drainage network mainly for drainage. The first phase of construction began in the winter of that year and was basically completed by 1964.
    Building such a large-scale modern electric irrigation and drainage project would be unimaginable without the help of the state. However, even with the help of the state, is it still necessary to be self-reliant, is it still necessary to work hard? The cadres and members of the Pearl River Delta gave a correct answer to this question. They said: State help is a good thing, but we should not lie on the state's investment; in addition to using the state's investment well, making sure the steel is used on the blade, we must also rely on the collective economy and be self-reliant. In the total investment of the entire Pearl River Delta electric irrigation and drainage project, state investment accounted for only 20%, and self-raised funds from communes and teams accounted for more than 70%. The people of the Pearl River Delta proved with facts that not only digging earthwork and repairing dikes should rely on their own hands, but building modern electric irrigation and drainage stations can also be done with their own hands.
    The large-scale construction of the Pearl River Delta electric irrigation and drainage network coincided with a time when China was experiencing severe natural disasters for three consecutive years, and modern revisionists broke their promises, causing temporary difficulties in China's national economy. At that time, there was a shortage of materials and incomplete equipment. The difficulties were numerous. However, the farmers of the delta, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly moved forward in the face of difficulties, and seriously dealt with every difficulty in the process of moving forward. They used poor methods and indigenous methods to deal with foreign equipment, and their hands, which were used to hoes, also created materials and equipment for modern industry, and operated modern machinery.
    A large number of water pumps needed for the electric irrigation and drainage network could not be supplied for a period of time, and many electric irrigation and drainage stations could not be installed. What to do? The Shenshi Brigade of the Shaxi Commune in Zhongshan County, in the brigade's own agricultural machinery repair factory, with several blacksmiths, carpenters, and cement workers, pondering over and over again, after five months of experimentation, finally used 100 kilograms of cement and 500 bricks to create a water pump casing with a diameter of 400 millimeters, installed an old propeller from a small motorboat, and a "native water pump" was born. Once the belt was hung on, it started up with a whoosh, and the water pumping effect was very good. The water and electricity department discovered this situation and held an on-site meeting here to promote their experience. Later, the masses in many places made their own native water pump casings, and the agricultural machinery factories in each county manufactured propellers, shafts, and other water pump "organs" for assembly. In a few years, a total of four to five hundred such native water pumps were built, ensuring the timely completion of the electric irrigation and drainage network and saving a lot of steel and funds. Most of these native water pumps are still of good quality to this day.
    At that time, the state's supply of cement for the construction of the electric irrigation and drainage network was also insufficient. What to do? The farmers of the Pearl River Delta did not wait either. Under the guidance of the engineering and technical personnel of the water and electricity department, they set up indigenous cement factories and burned cement above grade 400. This ensured the smooth construction of the electric irrigation and drainage network project.
    Such a large-scale modern project requires a large technical force. What to do if there is not enough technical force? The farmers of the Pearl River Delta said: Learn if you don't know. You can be the master of nature, and you can also be the master of modern technology. At the beginning of the project construction, each commune selected young farmers with education to learn on the job; the special district, county, and commune ran many training classes, training five or six thousand farmer technicians one after another.
    In this way, the people of the Pearl River Delta carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, conquered one difficulty after another, overcame various natural disasters, and laid the foundation for building the Pearl River Delta into a large-area, stable, and high-yield commodity grain and commodity sugar crop base.

      Boldly and Steadily Reform Production Technology
    While changing the production conditions of the Pearl River Delta, people also took a revolutionary attitude towards backward production technology.
    Water conservancy has passed the test, achieving the goal of stable production with guaranteed harvests against drought and flood. However, the people of the Pearl River Delta did not passively understand the passage of water conservancy as merely defending against drought and flood disasters, and that everything would be fine after the passage of water conservancy, stagnating. Instead, they regarded the passage of water conservancy as creating preconditions for striving for high yields, opening up a broad road for the revolution in production technology, and as the starting point for high yields. With a posture of continuous revolution, they considered attacking while defending, and actively revolutionized production technology.
    In the process of revolutionizing production technology, the Pearl River Delta first fought two annihilation battles: the fertilizer revolution and the seed revolution.
    In order to change the past habit of applying little or no fertilizer, the Pearl River Delta treated fertilizer work as a basic construction project. In 1961, when the water conservancy in some areas basically passed the test, they began to carry out basic fertilizer construction self-reliantly, focusing on raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, planting green manure crops, running small-scale fertilizer plants, and vigorously accumulating river mud fertilizer and miscellaneous soil fertilizer. The number of pigs raised has increased rapidly in recent years. Calculated by paddy field area, in 1965, the average number of pigs raised per mu was 0.58, an increase of more than one time compared with 1957. In 1962, the trial planting of several thousand mu of green manure crops began, and by 1965 it had expanded to nearly 2 million mu. The small fertilizer plants run by each county produce more than 73,000 tons of chemical fertilizer annually.
    Also in 1961, the Pearl River Delta experimented with and promoted short-stalked fine rice varieties. In that year, the area of short-stalked fine varieties was only more than 60,000 mu, and by 1964, it had basically achieved fine variety cultivation. In the Pearl River Delta, 70-80% of the production teams have established a seed field system, with three to four thousand full-time seed keepers. In the past two or three years, they have selected and retained enough fine varieties themselves every year.
    In the process of reforming cultivation techniques, the farmers of the delta also experienced failures and setbacks. However, they adhered to the correct attitude, analyzed the failures and setbacks in detail, summed up experience, found lessons, and continued to move forward.
    In 1957, some areas of the Pearl River Delta once changed 80-90% of the area from "zheng gao" (double-cropping intercropping) to "fan geng" (double-cropping continuous cropping) all at once, resulting in a decrease in production. As a result, some people said: "Zheng gao cannot be changed." In 1958 and 1959, the delta introduced tens of millions of jin of northern japonica rice and short-legged Nant special varieties from other places and promoted them on a large scale. As a result, the harvest was worse than the original varieties. Some people said again: "Seeds cannot be changed." For a time, there were many debates on the issue of technical reform.
    The Party committees in the Pearl River Delta region conducted a specific analysis of this situation and believed that: The reason why "zheng gao" was changed to "fan geng" and production decreased was because the conditions of water, fertilizer, and labor in many areas were not met at that time, and they were not treated differently, so they were all changed to "fan geng." The reason why planting northern japonica rice and short-legged Nant specials reduced production was because they had not been planted before, and they did not understand their requirements for the objective environment, so they were hurriedly planted on a large scale. It is not that the fate of backward farming habits cannot be revolutionized, but that in the process of revolution, the subjective does not conform to or does not completely conform to the objective, and wants to complete this revolution all at once. After such analysis and summarization, the farmers of the Pearl River Delta moved forward firmly again. When carrying out each cultivation technique reform, they adopted the method of "boldly in small areas, steadily on a large scale," first experimenting in small areas, and then experimenting separately on a larger scale after success, and then promoting it on a large scale. In this way, after two or three years of practice, a trial promotion network for cultivation technique reform was gradually formed in various places.

      Advancing on the Road of Stable and High Yield
    Large-scale farmland capital construction and technological innovation have promoted the great development of agricultural production, and the development of agricultural production has promoted basic construction in other aspects.
    In the past few years, after the Pearl River Delta has continuously obtained good harvests, the communes' wealth has become thicker and thicker, and the income of the members has increased more and more. They naturally look forward to a bright future—mechanization and semi-mechanization. The seven counties and two cities in the Foshan Special District currently have more than 1,200 standard tractors, with mechanized cultivation accounting for about 40% of the arable area. There are also more than 4,800 electric threshers, more than 3,600 electric feed beaters, more than 1,800 electric rainers, and various other agricultural machinery. After the bumper harvest in 1965, many commune production teams continued to use a portion of their collective accumulation to add various agricultural machinery, further improving labor productivity. In order to further consolidate the dikes, starting from the winter of 1964, the farmers of the delta continued to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, going to the sea islands dozens of miles away, opening mountains to quarry stones, and transporting them back to repair dikes and build gates, determined to build the more than 1,000-kilometer-long sea dike on the edge of the South China Sea into a "Great Wall of the South China Sea" within three years.
    The Pearl River Delta is constantly advancing on the road of stable and high yield!

    珠江三角洲——稳产高产的粮糖基地
    源远流长的西江、北江、东江，在广东中南部汇合后，分成了数以百计的纵横如网的河汊。这三条江水夹着大量泥沙，在这里冲积成一块一万九千八百平方公里的大平原。
    这就是珠江三角洲。
    珠江三角洲的主体部分，包括十一个县和三个市，即：佛山专区的南海、番禺、顺德、新会、中山、珠海、斗门七县，佛山、江门二市，惠阳专区的东莞、增城、宝安三县，以及花县和广州市。十一县三市的耕地面积共七百七十九万亩，其中稻田六百四十七万亩，农业人口四百八十万。
      繁荣富饶的“广东粮仓”
    解放以来，珠江三角洲的广大农民，在党的领导下，坚持艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，开展大规模的改造自然的斗争，现在已经基本上把珠江三角洲建设成为我国大面积稳产高产的商品粮和商品糖料作物基地。
    今天的珠江三角洲，到处可以看见社会主义建设的巨大步伐。
    在纵横交错的河汊两岸，蜿蜒伸展着一道道坚实的大堤围。这些堤围一般高五米到十米，底宽十米到二三十米。在许多河汊汇流的地方，矗立着一座座水闸。水闸联接着堤围，结成了长达一万多公里的铜墙铁壁，保护着数百万亩富饶丰腴的农田。它已经多次经受了台风洪水的考验。
    珠江三角洲的上空，如今出现了现代化的规模巨大的电网。耸立在原野上的一座座铁塔，托着一排排的高压输电线路。这个高压电网总长五千四百多公里，它联接着装机容量十八万二千瓩的三千八百多座电动排灌站。有了这些排灌站，如今的珠江三角洲，即使遇到一天二三百毫米的暴雨，三四天后内涝渍水即可排干；如果六七个月连续不雨，也能确保稻田正常的需水量。
    随着农作物的稳定增产，珠江三角洲正在越来越显著地发挥“广东粮仓”的作用，正在对我国的社会主义建设作出越来越多的贡献。仅据佛山专区七县二市统计，一九六五年提供的商品粮达到十五亿斤，商品蔗四十六亿斤。一九六五年番禺县提供的商品粮数量，比一九四九年的粮食总产量还要多。每年提供商品粮超过一千万斤的公社和超过一百万斤的大队，在珠江三角洲也比比皆是。中山县的民众公社和港口公社，每年提供的商品粮都超过五千万斤。此外，珠江三角洲的农民每年还给国家提供了大量的蚕茧、塘鱼、黄麻、水果和蔬菜。同时，他们还留足了扩大再生产所需的物资，一九六五年每个农业人口口粮在五百斤以上，许多生产队和社员都有储备粮。
    但是，解放以前，珠江三角洲是个洪、涝、风、潮、旱、咸各种灾害俱全的地方。每年洪水季节，西江、北江、东江，动辄以每秒几万立方米的流量涌到这里。于是，到处江河滚滚，洪水横流。崩堤围，毁田园，淹房屋，庄稼失收，人民逃荒的事，几乎年年都有。据资料记载，从二十世纪开始到一九四九年的四十九年间，较大的洪水灾害就有三十六次。那时，深受阶级剥削和自然灾害双重苦难的沙田区的农户都有一只小艇。洪水一来，人们划起小艇，一家大小随处漂流。庄稼无指望，人也无定居。那时，所谓“广东粮仓”的珠江三角洲，粮食不能自给，年年要靠洋米过活。解放初期，国家每年还要供应这个地区一部分粮食。
          铜墙铁壁锁洪水
    今天繁荣富饶的珠江三角洲，是在满目疮痍的烂摊子上建设起来的。一九四九年解放的时候，珠江三角洲刚刚经过一场洪水的洗劫，大地残破，遍地哀鸿。当时的中共珠江地委和有关的县委，研究了灾情，认为洪水是珠江三角洲最大的自然灾害，决定组织三角洲农民修堤防洪。
    修堤，对于祖祖辈辈深受水害的珠江三角洲农民来说，有着十分强烈的愿望。他们说：堤围是命根子。旧社会给我们留下这些破堤，使我们受够了苦难，再不能从我们手中把苦难留给下一代。党领导我们修堤，没说的，坚决干！于是，几十万人上了工地，终年不断地挖泥挑泥，修筑堤围。从一九四九年冬天到一九五三年春天。三角洲农民付出三四千万个劳动工日，做了三四千万土方，把三四千条堤围、一万多公里长的堤线，全部修建起来了。
    但是，这期间新修的堤围还不够巩固，每年洪水来时，有的崩缺，有的险象频生。年年修堤，年年出险，年年堵堤。于是有些人有了畏难情绪，说：“老一辈没有把堤围修好，我们这一辈恐怕也难修好。”
    针对这个情况，各级党委不断加强思想政治工作，反复教育群众：把珠江三角洲这么多这么长的堤围修好，不是一两年、三五年的事，要有不怕艰苦，长期奋斗的决心。同时，各级党委进一步研究治水策略。他们分析了当时堤围的分布状况和几年来洪水泛滥的规律，作出了新的修堤防洪方案。这以后，各县就有计划、有系统地进行联围筑闸工程。五年间，珠江三角洲农民做了一两亿个土方，把几千条分散的小堤围，联接成几百条巩固的大堤围。
    在和洪水斗争的同时，珠江三角洲沙田区的农民还进行了另一项十分艰巨的农田基本建设——给沙田“入泥”。
    三角洲靠近江河入海处，有上百万亩比江河水位低一两尺、常年泡在水里的涝洼沙地，产量很低。为了改造这些涝洼地，三角洲农民采取一举三得的办法，从河汊里捞起河泥，铺到田里。这样，既垫高了田面，又给瘦田增添了肥泥，还疏浚了河道。十多年来，每年冬春，珠江三角洲的水网地区，都有数以万计的船艇在捞泥铺田。现在，已有几十万亩低洼田垫高了五寸到一尺，已挖的河泥总量超过五亿立方米。
          电动排灌抗旱涝
    凶暴的洪水，在人民面前初步驯服了。每年洪水季节，不再决堤崩围了。
    但是珠江三角洲农民同自然斗争的步伐并没有停止。因为洪水虽然不再泛滥，然而一到雨季，江河水位猛涨，堤围内渍水排不出去，形成内涝灾害。每年内涝一发生，就有几十万人绞动几十万部水车，夜以继日地车水。尽管如此，禾苗还是在不同程度上受到损失。
    一九五九年，中共广东省委决定把珠江三角洲建设成为大面积的稳产高产的商品粮基地，从各方面加强对珠江三角洲的领导。具体措施之一就是帮助珠江三角洲建设一个以排涝为主的电动排灌网。当年冬天开始了第一期工程建设，到一九六四年已经基本建成。
    建设这样大规模的现代化的电动排灌工程，没有国家的帮助是不可想象的。但是，有了国家的帮助，还要不要自力更生，还要不要穷干苦干呢？珠江三角洲的干部和社员，对这个问题作了正确的回答。他们说：国家帮助，这是好事，可是我们不应该躺在国家的投资上面；除了把国家的投资用好，做到钢用在刀刃上以外，还要依靠集体经济，自力更生。在整个珠江三角洲电动排灌工程的总投资中，国家投资仅占百分之二十多，社队自筹的占百分之七十多。珠江三角洲的人民用事实证明，不仅挖土方、修堤围，应该依靠自己的双手，建设现代化的电动排灌站，也同样可以凭着自己的双手。
    珠江三角洲电动排灌网大规模建设的时候，也是我国连续三年发生严重的自然灾害、现代修正主义者背信弃义，使我国国民经济出现暂时困难的时候。当时，要材料，材料不足；要设备，设备不全。困难是重重的。然而，三角洲的农民，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，用毛泽东思想武装自己，在困难中无所畏惧地前进，在前进中认真对待每一个困难。他们用穷办法土办法跟洋设备打交道，他们拿惯锄头的双手也制造出现代工业的材料、设备，操纵起现代化的机械。
    电动排灌网需要的大批水泵，有一个时期供应不上，许多电动排灌站无法安装。怎么办？中山县沙溪公社圣狮大队就在大队自办的农械修理厂里，由几个铁工、木工、水泥工，琢磨来琢磨去，经过五个月的试验，终于用一百公斤水泥和五百块砖，造成一个口径四百毫米的水泵外壳，装上一个小机动船的旧螺旋桨，一个“土水泵”诞生了。皮带一挂上，呼呼地开动起来了，抽水效果很好。水电部门发现了这个情况，在这里召开现场会议，推广他们的经验。以后，许多地方的群众自己制造土水泵外壳，由各县的农械厂制造螺旋桨、转轴等水泵“内脏”，装配起来。几年间，这样的土水泵共造了四五百个，保证了电动排灌网的及时建成，节约了大量的钢材和资金。这些土水泵使用到现在，绝大部分仍然质量良好。
    那时候，国家供应修建电动排灌网工程的水泥也不够用。怎么办？珠江三角洲的农民同样不等待。他们在水电部门工程技术人员的指导下，办起了土水泥厂，烧出四百号以上的水泥。这样，保证了电动排灌网工程的顺利兴建。
    这样大规模的现代化工程，需要很大一支技术力量。技术力量不足怎么办？珠江三角洲农民说：不懂就学。能做大自然的主人，也能做现代技术的主人。工程建设一开始，各公社便选派有文化的青年农民跟班学；专区、县、公社办了许多训练班，先后培训了五六千名农民技术员。
    珠江三角洲的人民就这样发扬自力更生的革命精神，征服了一个又一个的困难，战胜了各种自然灾害，为把珠江三角洲建设为大面积稳产高产的商品粮和商品糖料作物基地打下了基础。
      大胆稳当地改革生产技术
    在改变珠江三角洲生产条件的同时，人们也对落后的生产技术采取革命的态度。
    水利过关，达到了旱涝保收的稳产目的。但是，珠江三角洲人民不是把水利过关消极地理解为仅仅是防御水旱灾害，水利过了关便万事大吉，停滞不前，而是把水利过关看作为争取高产创造了前提条件，给生产技术革命开辟了广阔道路，是高产的起点。他们以不断革命的姿态，在防御时便考虑着进攻，积极地革生产技术的命。
    在革生产技术的命的过程中，珠江三角洲首先打了两个歼灭战：肥料革命和种子革命。
    为了改变过去少施肥和不施肥的习惯，珠江三角洲把肥料工作当做一项基本建设来抓。一九六一年，当一部分地区水利基本过关的时候，就开始自力更生进行肥料基本建设，抓养猪积肥，种绿肥作物，办小型化肥厂，大搞河泥肥和积攒土杂肥。养猪数量这几年增加得很快，按稻田面积计算，一九六五年平均每亩养猪零点五八头，比一九五七年增长一倍多。一九六二年开始试种几千亩绿肥作物，到一九六五年已扩大到近二百万亩。各县自办的小型化肥厂，年产化肥七万三千多吨。
    也是在一九六一年，珠江三角洲试验推广水稻矮秆良种，当年矮秆良种面积只有六万多亩，到一九六四年便基本实现良种化。在珠江三角洲，百分之七八十的生产队都建立了种子田制度，有专职种子员三四万人，近两三年，年年都是自己选留出足够的良种。
    在改革耕作技术的过程中，三角洲农民也有过失败，受过挫折。但是他们坚持正确的态度，对失败和挫折进行具体分析，总结经验，找到教训，继续前进。
    一九五七年，珠江三角洲有些地区曾经一下子把百分之八九十面积的“挣稿”改为“翻耕”（双季间作改为双季连作），结果减了产。于是有些人说：“挣稿改不得。”一九五八年和一九五九年，三角洲从外地引进了几千万斤北方粳稻和矮脚南特良种，大面积推广，结果收成比原来的品种还差。又有些人说：“种子换不得。”一时，在技术改革问题上，争论很多。
    珠江三角洲地区的党委对这个情况进行具体分析，认为：“挣稿”改“翻耕”所以减产，是因为当时不少地区的水、肥、劳力等条件跟不上，没有分别对待，就一律改成翻耕。种北方粳稻和矮脚南特所以减产，是因为以前没有种过，摸不清它们对客观环境的要求，就仓促地大面积种植。这不是耕作落后习惯的命革不得，而是在革命过程中，主观不符合或者不完全符合客观，想一下子完成这个革命。经过这样分析总结，珠江三角洲农民又坚定地前进了。他们进行每一项耕作技术改革时，都采取“小块大胆，面上稳当”的办法，先小面积试验，成功后再在较大的面上分别试验，然后才大面积推广。这样，经过两三年实践，各地逐渐形成了一个耕作技术改革的试验推广网。
      在稳产高产的道路上前进
    大规模的农田基本建设和生产技术革新，促进了农业生产的大发展，农业生产的发展又推动了其他方面的基本建设。
    这几年，珠江三角洲连续获得了好收成以后，公社的家底越来越厚，社员的收入越来越多，他们自然而然地瞻望着一个美好的前景——机械化和半机械化。佛山专区的七县二市，目前已有拖拉机一千二百多标准台，机耕面积占可耕面积百分之四十左右，还有电动脱粒机四千八百多部、电动饲料打浆机三千六百多部、电动降雨机一千八百多部以及其他各种农机具。一九六五年丰收后，许多公社生产队继续用一部分集体积累添购各种农机具，进一步提高劳动生产率。为了进一步把堤围加固，从一九六四年冬开始，三角洲农民继续发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，远出到几十里以外的海岛上，开山取石，运回来修堤筑闸，决心要在三年内把南海边上一千多公里长的海堤，垒成“南海长城”。
    珠江三角洲正在稳产高产的道路上不断地前进着！
