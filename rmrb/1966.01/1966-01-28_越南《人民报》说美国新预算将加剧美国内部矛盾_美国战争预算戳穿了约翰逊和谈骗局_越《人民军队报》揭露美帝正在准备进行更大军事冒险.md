Title: Vietnamese *People's Daily* Says U.S. New Budget Will Aggravate Internal Contradictions in the U.S., U.S. War Budget Exposes Johnson's Peace Talk Deception, Vietnamese *People's Army Daily* Reveals U.S. Imperialism is Preparing for Greater Military Adventures

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 27th – A January 27th editorial in the Vietnamese *People’s Daily* commenting on the U.S. government’s new fiscal budget, pointed out that the more U.S. imperialism invests manpower and resources in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the more disastrous failures it will suffer.

    The editorial said that the U.S. fiscal budget for 1967, announced by the Johnson administration on January 24th, is a war budget. It exposes the U.S.’s ferocious face and aggressive ambitions towards Vietnam and shatters its deceptive smokescreen of “seeking peace.”

    The editorial pointed out that 1965 was the year the U.S. invested the most manpower and resources in the war of aggression against Vietnam, and also the year the U.S. aggressors suffered the most shameful failures. For the U.S. aggressors, the war of aggression against Vietnam is turning into a war of losses in both lives and money.

    The editorial said that the war of aggression against Vietnam has become a heavy burden on the U.S. economy, which is facing a crisis and increasingly threatening the lives of ordinary Americans. The U.S.’s new fiscal budget clearly reflects the serious difficulties caused to the U.S. economy by intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The editorial pointed out that, in order to increase expenditures for the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Johnson administration is forced to reduce expenditures on some construction of their fraudulent so-called "Great Society" "anti-poverty" programs. They also plan to increase taxes, stop wage increases for workers, restrict capital exports, and propose controlling prices and raw materials. The longer the war of aggression against Vietnam drags on, the more it will weaken the political and economic position of U.S. imperialism in the capitalist world, further expand the movement within the U.S. against the war of aggression against Vietnam, and sharpen the contradictions within U.S. society and within the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie. The U.S.’s new fiscal budget foreshadows the arrival of new storms in the political, social, and economic spheres of the U.S.

    The editorial said that although Vietnam's economic strength is not as good as that of the United States, the Vietnamese people have great and infinite potential, which is: a correct and creative political and military line, the firm, thorough, and revolutionary spirit of the entire army and people, and a strong economy controlled by the people. The most economically developed imperialism in the world—U.S. imperialism—is being defeated miserably by a small, economically backward nation. If the U.S. continues to wage its war of aggression, it will encounter greater difficulties and will ultimately be completely defeated.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 26th – The Vietnamese *People’s Army Daily* published a commentary on January 26th pointing out that while U.S. imperialism is harping on the old tune of "peaceful discussions," it is actively preparing for more serious military adventures.

    The commentary said that in the past month, Johnson has dispatched his lackeys, carrying "fourteen-point peace baskets," running around peddling them, attempting to deceive public opinion.

    The commentary pointed out that, in reality, the U.S. is strengthening the war of aggression and preparing for more serious military adventures. The U.S. authorities are massively increasing war expenses, troops, and weapons and equipment for the aggression against Vietnam. They are also stepping up the construction of military and logistics bases in Thailand and South Vietnam, preparing to expand the war. The U.S. military is conducting frenzied "sweeps" in South Vietnam, bombing the Lao liberated areas, and intensifying reconnaissance and provocative activities against North Vietnam. In short, in action, the U.S.’s "sincerity" is to intensify and expand the war.

    越南《人民报》说美国新预算将加剧美国内部矛盾
    美国战争预算戳穿了约翰逊和谈骗局
    越《人民军队报》揭露美帝正在准备进行更大军事冒险
    新华社河内二十七日电  越南《人民报》二十七日发表的评论美国政府新的财政预算的社论指出，美帝国主义越是把更多的人力物力投入侵略越南的战争，就越遭到更加惨重的失败。
    社论说，约翰逊政府一月二十四日公布的美国一九六七年度财政预算，是一个战争预算。它暴露了美国对越南的凶残面目和侵略野心，粉碎了它的“谋求和平”的骗人的烟幕。
    社论指出，一九六五年，是美国把人力物力投入侵越战争最多的一年，也是美国侵略者遭到最可耻的失败的一年。对于美国侵略者来说，侵越战争正在变成人财两亏的战争。
    社论说，侵略越南的战争，对正面临着危机和越来越严重地威胁着美国普通人民的生活的美国经济来说，已经变成了一个重担。美国的新财政预算十分清楚地体现了美国经济由于强化侵略越南战争而引起的严重困难。
    社论指出，为了给侵略越南战争增加开支，约翰逊政府被迫要减少一些建设它们诡诈的所谓“伟大社会”的“反贫困”计划的开支。它们还计划增加税收，停止给工人增加工资，限制资本输出，提出控制价格和原料。侵略越南战争越拖长，就会越加削弱美帝国主义在资本主义世界中的政治和经济地位，使美国国内反对侵略越南战争的运动更加广泛地发展，使美国社会内部和美国垄断资产阶级内部的矛盾越加尖锐。美国的新财政预算预兆着在美国的政治、社会和经济领域中的新风暴的到来。
    社论说，尽管越南的经济力量不如美国，但是越南人民有着伟大和无穷的潜力，那就是：正确和创造性的政治路线和军事路线，全军全民的坚决、彻底和革命的精神，以及由人民掌握的实力充沛的经济。世界上经济最发达的帝国主义——美帝国主义正被一个弱小的经济落后的民族打得惨败。美国继续进行侵略战争，就将遭到更大的困难，而最后定将彻底失败。
    据新华社河内二十六日电越南《人民军队报》二十六日发表评论指出，美帝国主义在重弹“和平讨论”滥调的同时，正在积极准备进行更加严重的军事冒险。
    评论说，近一个月来，约翰逊派遣了它的爪牙，提着“十四点和平篮子”，四出奔走兜售，妄图欺骗舆论。
    评论指出，实际上，美国正在强化侵略战争，并且为更加严重的军事冒险行动进行准备。美国当局正在大量增加侵略越南的战争费用、军队和武器装备。他们还加紧在泰国和南越增建军事和后勤基地，准备扩大战争。美国军队正在越南南方进行疯狂的“扫荡”，对老挝解放区进行轰炸，加紧对越南北方进行侦察和挑衅等活动。总之，在行动上，美国的“诚意”就是加紧扩大战争。
