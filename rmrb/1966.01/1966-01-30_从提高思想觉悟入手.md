    Starting from Improving Ideological Awareness
    In the past, whenever our Shuangbai County People's Bank had shortages of funds or accounting errors, we used regulations to "plug the loopholes." In 1964, we stipulated thirty-one regulations for accounting and cashier work, and the review, bookkeeping, and cashier counters also specifically stipulated twenty-one "standards." However, errors were still numerous.
    Last year, the bank leadership organized employees to analyze the causes of errors based on facts. Everyone believed that most errors were caused by a lack of concentration at work, and we should eliminate errors by starting from improving ideological awareness. Many comrades repeatedly examined themselves using Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, and launched basic skills training activities. As a result, from January to November of last year, the amount of wrong funds decreased by more than 80% compared with the same period of the previous year. The calculation speed was also faster than before.

    从提高思想觉悟入手
    我们双柏县人民银行，过去短了款，错了账，就用制度“堵漏洞”。一九六四年规定了会计、出纳工作的三十一条制度，复核、记账、出纳等专柜又具体规定了二十一条“杠杠”。可是，差错仍然很多。
    去年，银行领导组织职工实事求是地分析了产生差错的原因。大家认为，大多数差错都是由于工作的时候思想不集中所造成的，应该从提高思想觉悟入手，来消灭差错。许多同志反复用毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的思想对照检查自己，并开展了练基本功的活动。结果，去年一至十一月份，错款额比前年同期下降百分之八十以上。计算速度也比过去快了。
