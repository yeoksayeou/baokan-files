    Starting from Reality, Producing and Promoting Semi-Mechanized Farm Implements
    Jia Anlan
    In recent years, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of workers in the handicraft system, based on China's conditions and the actual needs of local agricultural production, have created, produced, and promoted a large number of semi-mechanized and small mechanized agricultural implements while doing a good job in the production and supply of old-style medium and small farm tools. According to incomplete statistics from the handicraft departments of nineteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Anhui, Henan, and Sichuan, more than 1.3 million pieces of various semi-mechanized agricultural implements were produced from January to September 1965. These included implements for plowing, tilling, irrigation, harvesting, threshing, rural transportation, processing agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, and basic farmland construction. These agricultural implements are generally small in size, simple in structure, highly efficient, perform well, highly adaptable, and inexpensive. They have played a significant role in improving agricultural production efficiency, saving labor, ensuring timely cultivation, promoting increased agricultural production, and increasing commune members' income. They have been warmly welcomed by the masses of peasants in various places since their appearance.

          Objective Requirements
    The handicraft departments' active improvement of agricultural tools and creation of semi-mechanized and small mechanized agricultural implements is an urgent task proposed based on the actual needs of the developing objective situation. In the past few years, handicraft departments in various places have placed the production of old-style medium and small farm tools in the primary position, concentrating their efforts on manufacturing and repairing a large number of iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools, farm boats, and various agricultural vehicles. At present, the quantity and quality of old-style farm tools have mostly reached and exceeded the highest levels in history, meeting agricultural production needs to a certain extent. On the other hand, more than 500 million farmers in our country are, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, advancing towards the depth and breadth of agricultural production on an unprecedented scale and at an unprecedented speed. All parts of the country are building stable and high-yield farmland, and a new upsurge in agricultural production has emerged. With the expansion of basic farmland construction, the increasing demands for stable and high yields, the development of diversified operations, the widespread application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, etc., old-style medium and small farm tools are increasingly unable to adapt to this new situation, and the broad masses of peasants are urgently demanding the reform of existing farm tools. Therefore, while continuing to produce old-style farm tools, handicraft departments at all levels have included the work of improving agricultural tools in their important agenda.
    Some people believe that handicrafts can only be about tinkering and repairing, producing some old-style small farm tools such as shovels, hoes, and sickles, and that engaging in semi-mechanized agricultural implements is "aiming too high" and "not doing one's job." We believe that this view is incorrect. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his work report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "While adopting the latest technological achievements in the world as much as possible, we should extensively carry out mass movements to improve tools and innovate technologies in cities and villages throughout the country, so that mechanical operation, semi-mechanical operation and necessary manual labor can be appropriately combined." This has pointed out a clear direction for our work. Handicraft enterprises are numerous and widespread, located in both urban and rural areas, with great production flexibility and strong adaptability. They are close to the countryside and understand the needs of peasants best. Through years of work practice, they have accumulated a lot of experience in serving agriculture. At the same time, using the collective capital accumulation of handicrafts can save state investment. In particular, handicraft factories and cooperatives have undergone more than ten years of technological transformation, and with the support of the state and their own efforts, equipment capacity has been greatly improved, and new technologies and processes have been widely applied. Recently, the Second Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture held a national agricultural implements exhibition in Beijing, which fully demonstrated the great achievements of handicraft factories and cooperatives in manufacturing and promoting semi-mechanized agricultural implements, proving the profound potential and superior conditions of handicraft enterprises in producing semi-mechanized agricultural implements.

  High, Large, and Precise as the Main Focus, or Simple, Small, and Inexpensive as the Main Focus?
    Some comrades believe that as soon as agricultural mechanization is mentioned, high-tech, large-scale, and precise things are good, and they are skeptical about the practice of developing semi-mechanized and small mechanized agricultural implements, believing that "there is not much future" and "it won't last long." This is also a one-sided and wrong view. We should look at any problem from two aspects. High-tech, large-scale, and precise machinery certainly have the advantages of being strong, efficient, and labor-saving, but they also have problems and shortcomings such as large investment, difficulty in manufacturing, poor adaptability, few varieties, the need for electricity, coal, and other power sources, and the difficulty in mastering the technology of use and repair. Semi-mechanized agricultural implements are more efficient and labor-saving than old-style farm tools, and compared with large-scale agricultural machinery, they are simple in structure, small and light, adaptable, have more varieties, are inexpensive, and have low technical requirements, making manufacturing, use, and repair relatively easy. It is not only suitable for the current economic and technical levels in rural areas of our country, but also suitable for the decentralized and complex characteristics of agricultural production. Everyone knows that agricultural production has strong regional and seasonal characteristics, and is greatly affected by natural conditions such as water, drought, wind, insects, heat, cold, shade, and sunshine. Moreover, the various industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as the crop varieties and farming systems in planting, are diverse. Therefore, the various operations in agricultural labor and their requirements for agricultural implements are extremely complex. Even if mechanization and modernization are realized in the future, it is difficult to imagine that high-tech, large-scale, and precise agricultural machinery will be used everywhere. In some areas, industries, and operations, such as in mountainous areas, slopes, in forestry, sideline occupations, and animal husbandry, in operations such as rice transplanting, inter-row cultivation and weeding, and insect prevention and extermination, and in peasant household affairs, some small, inexpensive, simple, and lightweight agricultural implements are still needed. This is the case in the future, and at present, we should not only look at the high-tech, large-scale, and precise, and think that simple, small, and inexpensive agricultural implements have no future, but should take two-pronged approach, combining high-tech, large-scale, and precise with simple, small, and inexpensive, and focusing on the latter for a certain period of time.
    What kind of agricultural implements to develop should be based on the actual situation in our country, and we should not blindly imitate foreign things. The current semi-mechanized agricultural implements are generally gradually reformed and developed on the basis of old-style farm tools. They are home-grown and suitable for the characteristics and actual needs of agricultural production in our country. We should test, manufacture, and promote them. Take our own path and develop a set of agricultural implements with Chinese characteristics.
    According to the experience of various places, it can be summarized that we should currently focus on developing "many, small, good, simple, and inexpensive" agricultural implements, that is, agricultural implements with diverse varieties, small size as the main focus, good performance, simple structure, and low prices. Everyone knows that our country has a vast territory and complex terrain, and the climate, crops, farming systems, as well as intensive cultivation, diversified operations, and production and living habits vary from place to place. At present, the rural people's communes take the production team as the basic accounting unit, the production unit is small, and the accumulation is not much, and the purchasing power is not high. Therefore, at present, there is an urgent need to produce more "many, small, good, simple, and inexpensive" farm tools. No matter how precise and efficient a machine is, if it does not meet the actual needs of agricultural production, or if it is needed but the production team and peasants cannot afford it, or if they can afford it but it is not suitable for use due to the small scale of the production team, or if the cost is too high and does not conform to the principle of economic accounting, it will not be welcomed by the masses of peasants, nor will it be promoted.
    The reason why semi-mechanized agricultural implements are welcomed by the broad masses of peasants is first of all their "many," that is, they are diverse and rich in varieties, specifications, and models. They can be suitable for different terrains, different crops, and different farming systems, and can use different power or fuels. They have those suitable for use in mountainous and hilly areas, as well as those suitable for use in plains and water network areas. They have those for agricultural use, as well as those for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. From cultivation to harvesting to grain processing, there are corresponding agricultural implements. There are special-purpose implements, and there are also implements that can be used for multiple purposes. Some are driven by electricity, and some use human power, water power, wind power, and animal power. Some are suitable for use in areas with electricity, and some can be used in areas without electricity. Taking threshers as an example, there are now various threshers that have been successfully trial-produced and widely promoted, such as electric, hand-cranked, foot-pedaled, and water-powered threshers. The water lifting and irrigation implements produced in various places are even more diverse, including triple pumps, jet pumps, floating pumps, closed-type suction waterwheels, artificial rainfall machines, etc.
    At the same time, because they are "small, good, and simple," that is, they have the advantages of small size, good performance, and simple structure, manufacturing and promotion are relatively easy, and they can be suitable for various terrains, and are convenient to move and operate. For example, the cotton and wheat row seeder produced by the Chuansha County Agricultural Implement Factory in Shanghai can sow cotton and three wheats. The machine is light and weighs only nine kilograms. It can loosen the soil, open ditches, sow seeds, cover the soil, and flatten it. A woman labor force can operate it without livestock, and the efficiency is more than ten times higher than manual labor. Zhangye County in Gansu Province slightly improved the old-style stone mill, installing four gears of different sizes under the mill, so that the efficiency increased by about two times. The livestock turns one circle, and the stone mill can turn three circles, grinding more than 20 jin of flour per hour. The floating pump produced by the Anyi Iron and Wood Cooperative in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, is simple in structure and easy to use. It can move and irrigate on various rivers, canals, and lakes, and is not restricted by suction head and installation. The body can be placed in the water, and water can be delivered by installing a wire.
    Another important feature is "inexpensive." These agricultural implements are inexpensive and suitable for the current economic level of rural areas. They do not cost much, but they solve a big problem. For example, the ramie peeler created by the Nansheng Ironware Cooperative in Pinghe County, Fujian Province, costs only 1.9 yuan, which increases work efficiency by more than two times compared with manual operation, and improves the quality of peeling by one level, which can increase the net income of 20 to 30 jin of ramie per mu. The Xianyou Handicraft Cooperative successfully trial-produced a sugarcane leaf peeler, which costs only 4.5 jiao per piece, and each person can peel more than half a mu of sugarcane leaves per day, which is three times higher than manual peeling. The hand-cranked corn thresher manufactured by the Zigong City Tool Factory in Sichuan has high efficiency, good quality, is light and durable, can thresh 50 to 60 kilograms per hour, and costs only more than 7 yuan.

  Implement the Mass Line and Carry Forward the Spirit of Self-Reliance
    In order to develop semi-mechanized agricultural implements, we must also implement the principle of starting from reality and actively creating in the process of design, trial production, and production. To this end, we must implement the mass line and implement the "three-in-one combination" both inside and outside the factory. That is, inside the factory, implement the three-in-one combination of leaders, veteran workers, and technicians, and outside the factory, implement the three-in-one combination of factories, scientific research institutions, and commune and team masses. This is an important experience for the agricultural implement production to develop more, faster, better, and more economically. We must adhere to repeated experiments, continuous summaries, continuous improvements, and gradual improvements. We must not be intimidated by difficulties and failures, and we must not be satisfied with existing achievements. Reform and innovation work must have priorities, and we must focus on the projects that peasants demand most urgently, the key to production, cost less, and have greater benefits. To do this, we must organize handicraft management departments and factory and cooperative workers to go to rural communes and teams to stay at selected points, fully conduct investigations and research, and strive for the assistance of scientific research departments and other relevant departments. Since 1962, the handicraft departments in the Jinan area of Shanxi Province have successively organized more than 400 "three-in-one combination" groups with more than 2,000 leaders, technicians, workers, and members, and conducted investigations and research in more than 700 communes and more than 2,000 production teams. According to the actual needs of agriculture, a large number of agricultural implements were created and supplied to local needs.
    The agricultural implement reform movement is the most concerned event of hundreds of millions of peasants, and it is a great mass movement. We must rely on and give play to the wisdom and enthusiasm of the broad masses to do a good job. Peasants are often both users and creators. They have the deepest experience in the quality of agricultural implements. Therefore, farm implement factories and cooperatives must discuss and carry out the manufacture of new farm tools or the improvement of old farm tools with the communes, teams, and peasant masses. Some places have adopted methods such as peasants proposing topics, workers writing articles, factories and cooperatives reforming; peasants appraising, or peasants creating, and factories and cooperatives promoting, so that factories and rural communes and teams are closely combined. This not only has economic and technical significance, but also strengthens the worker-peasant alliance and has far-reaching political significance.
    In order to actively create and promote semi-mechanized agricultural implements, we must also give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. Only by emphasizing the spirit of self-reliance can we mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of the broad masses. Self-reliance is especially important for handicrafts. Handicraft factories and cooperatives are generally less equipped and have lower technology than modern enterprises. Therefore, it is even more necessary to rely on the masses, rely on self-reliance, and engage in large-scale technological innovation. First of all, we must start with getting rid of heavy manual labor. Areas where conditions permit should make blacksmiths put down their sledgehammers as soon as possible and realize forging mechanization, and gradually realize woodworking and grinding mechanization. At the same time, we must also actively manufacture special tools and equipment, arm ourselves, and arm a group of farm implement factories and cooperatives in a planned and focused manner, so that they can play a backbone role in supporting agriculture. The desire of handicraft workers to change backward technology is very strong, and they have many favorable conditions for technological transformation. For example, there are more veteran workers, workers are less affected by "foreign frameworks," have a certain foundation, and have more production experience. A Shanghai cotton and wheat seeder exhibited at the National Agricultural Implements Exhibition was very popular among the peasant masses. It was created by Chuansha Agricultural Machinery Factory, a very small factory in Chuansha County, Shanghai. This factory has no senior technicians and the equipment is very simple, but they rely on the masses, rely on self-reliance, dare to think, dare to break through, dare to create, break the old "framework," and after repeated experiments, they finally successfully trial-produced it.
    According to the experience of various places in developing semi-mechanized agricultural implements, the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job is to put Mao Zedong Thought in command of everything, highlight politics, realize the ideological revolutionization of people, and earnestly establish the idea of serving agricultural production wholeheartedly. Wisdom comes from the masses, and revolutionary spirit produces products. Matter can change spirit, and spirit can change matter. Only in this way can the handicraft sector make greater contributions to promoting the in-depth development of the agricultural production upsurge and to promoting the realization of agricultural mechanization.

    从实际出发，生产与推广半机械化农具
    贾安澜
    近几年来，手工业系统的广大职工在各级党委的领导下，根据我国的情况和当地农业生产的实际需要，在搞好旧式中、小农具生产供应的同时，创造、生产和推广了大量的半机械化和小型机械化农机具。据河北、山西、辽宁、安徽、河南、四川等十九个省市手工业部门的不完全统计，一九六五年一至九月份，共生产了各种半机械化农机具一百三十多万件。其中，包括耕地、整地、排灌、收获、脱粒、农村运输、农副土特产品加工、农田基本建设等机具。这些农机具一般体形小巧，结构简单，工效高，性能好，适应性强，价格低廉。它们对提高农业生产效率，节约劳动力，保证及时耕作，促进农业增产，增加社员收入，都起了很大的作用。它们一经出现，即受到了各地农民群众的热烈欢迎。
          客观实际的要求
    手工业部门积极改进农业工具，创制半机械化和小型机械化农机具，是根据客观形势发展的实际需要而提出的一项迫切任务。过去几年，各地手工业部门都把旧式中、小农具生产放在首要地位，集中力量制造和修理了大量的铁木竹制农具、农船和各种农用车辆。目前，旧式农具在数量和质量上，大部分已经达到和超过了历史上最高水平，在一定程度上满足了农业生产的需要。另一方面，我国五亿多农民正在根据毛泽东同志的指示，以空前的规模和速度，向农业生产的深度和广度进军，全国各地都在建设稳产高产农田，农业生产的新高潮已经出现。随着农田基本建设的扩大，稳产和高产要求的提高，多种经营的发展，化学肥料和农药的普遍应用，等等，旧式中、小农具越来越不能适应这种新形势，广大农民迫切要求改革现有农具。因此，各级手工业部门就在继续生产旧式农具的同时，将改进农业工具的工作列入了自己的重要日程。
    有人认为，手工业只能是敲敲打打、修修补补，生产一些锹、镐、锄、镰等旧式小农具，搞半机械化农机具是“好高骛远”，“不务正业”。我们认为，这种看法是不对的。刘少奇同志在党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议上所作的工作报告中指出：“在尽可能地采用世界上最新的技术成就的同时，在全国的城市和农村中广泛地开展改良工具和革新技术的群众运动，使机械操作、半机械操作和必要的手工劳动适当地结合起来。”这给我们的工作指出了明确的方向。手工业企业点多面广，遍布城乡，生产灵活性大，适应性强，接近农村，最了解农民的需要；他们通过多年来的工作实践，已积累了不少为农业服务的经验；同时，利用手工业集体资金积累，可以节约国家投资；特别是手工业厂、社经历了十多年的技术改造，通过国家支援和自己武装自己，设备能力大大提高，新技术、新工艺得到了比较广泛的应用。最近，第二轻工业部和农业部在北京举办的全国农具展览会，就充分显示了手工业厂、社在制造和推广半机械化农机具方面的巨大成就，证明了手工业企业生产半机械化农机具的深厚潜力和优越条件。
  高、大、精为主，还是简、小、廉为主？
    有的同志只要一提到农业机械化，就认为是高技术的、大型的、精密的东西好，对发展半机械化和小型机械化农机具的做法抱有怀疑、认为“前途不大”，“兔子尾巴，长不了”。这也是一种片面的、错误的观点。我们看待任何问题都应当一分为二，高、大、精的机械固然有坚固、效率高、节省劳力等优点，但是也有投资大、制造困难、适应性差、品种少、需要电、煤等作动力、使用与修理的技术较难掌握等问题和缺点。而半机械化农机具比旧式农具工效高、省劳力，比大型农业机械，又结构简单，小巧轻便，适应性强，品种多，价格低廉，技术要求不高，制造、使用、修理都比较容易。它不但适合目前我国农村中经济水平和技术水平，而且也适合农业生产分散、复杂的特点。大家知道，农业生产有很强的地区性、季节性，受水、旱、风、虫、热、冷、阴、晴等自然条件的影响很大，并且农、林、牧、副、渔各业及种植业中的作物品种和耕作制度是多种多样的，因此，农业劳动中的各种作业项目及其对农机具的要求，是异常复杂的。即使将来实现了机械化、现代化，也很难设想到处都使用高、大、精的农业机械，在某些地区、行业与作业中，例如在山区、坡地，在林业、副业、畜牧业中，在插秧、中耕除草、防虫灭虫等作业中，在农民家庭事务中，还是需要一些小型的、廉价的、简单轻便的农机具的。在将来是如此，在目前，我们就更不应当眼睛只看着高、大、精，认为简、小、廉的农机具没有前途，而应当两条腿走路，将高、大、精与简、小、廉并举，并且在一定时期内以后者为主。
    发展什么样的农机具，应当从我国的实际情况出发，不能盲目模仿外国的东西。当前的半机械化农机具，一般是在旧式农具的基础上，逐步改革和发展起来的，是土生土长的，适合我国农业生产的特点和实际需要。我们应当加以试验、制造和推广。走自己的路，搞出一套中国化的农机具。
    根据各地的经验，可以概括地说，目前应当着重发展“多、小、好、简、廉”的农机具，即品种多样、小型为主、性能良好、结构简单、价格低廉的农机具。大家知道，我国地区辽阔，地形复杂，各地的气候、作物、耕作制度，以及精耕细作、多种经营、生产生活习惯各不相同；目前农村人民公社以生产队为基本核算单位，生产单位较小，积累还不多，购买力还不高。所以在当前就迫切要求多生产一些“多、小、好、简、廉”的农具；一件机器，不管它怎样精密，怎样效率高，但不适合农业生产的实际需要，或者是虽然需要，但生产队和农民买不起，或者虽然买得起，但由于生产队规模小，不适合使用，或者成本过高，不符合经济核算的原则，都不会为农民群众欢迎，也不会得到推广的。
    半机械化农机具所以受到广大农民群众的欢迎，首先是它们的“多”，在品种、规格、型号上多种多样，丰富多采；能适合于不同地形、不同作物、不同耕作制度，能使用不同的动力或燃料。它们既有适合山地、丘陵地区使用的，也有适合平原、水网地区使用的；既有农业用的，也有林、牧、副、渔业用的。从耕作到收获以至粮食加工等各个作业程序都有相应的农机具；有专用的机具，也有可以一机多用的；有的是电力带动的，也有使用人力、水力、风力和畜力的；有的在有电地区适用，有的在无电地区也可使用。以脱粒机为例，现在已试制成功并普遍推广的有电动、手摇、脚踏、水冲等多种脱粒机。各地生产的提水、排灌机具，更是多种多样，有三联泵、射流泵、飘浮泵、封闭式吸气水车、人工降雨机等。
    同时，又由于它们“小、好、简”，即具有机体小巧、性能良好、结构简单的优点，制造与推广比较容易，并能适合各种地形，搬运、操作方便。例如，上海市川沙县农具厂生产的棉麦两用条播机，能播种棉花及三麦，机体轻巧，重量仅为九公斤。它既能松土、开沟，又能下种、覆土、压平，一个妇女劳力即可操作，不用牲畜，效率比人工提高十多倍。甘肃省张掖县对旧式石磨稍加改进，在磨下安上四个大小不同的齿轮，使效率提高二倍左右，牲口转一圈，石磨可以转三圈，每小时磨面达二十余市斤。山西省运城县安邑铁木社生产的飘浮泵，结构简单，使用方便，能够在各种河流、水渠、湖泊上游动排灌，不受吸程和安装上的限制，把机体放在水中，安上导线即可送水。
    再一个重要特点是“廉”，这些农机具价格低廉，适合当前农村的经济水平。花钱不多，但是解决问题不小。如福建省平和县南胜铁器社创制的黄麻剥皮器，价格仅为一元九角，比手工操作提高工效二倍多，剥麻质量提高一级，每亩可增收净麻二、三十斤。仙游手工业社试制成功了甘蔗剥叶器，每支只要四角五分钱，每人每日可剥半亩多甘蔗叶，比手工剥叶提高三倍。四川自贡市工具厂制造的手摇玉米脱粒机，效率高、质量好，轻巧耐用，每小时能脱粒五、六十公斤，价格仅七元多钱。
  贯彻群众路线，发扬自力更生精神
    为了发展半机械化农机具，还必须在设计、试制和生产的过程中，贯彻从实际出发和积极创造的原则。为此，必须贯彻执行群众路线，实行厂内外两个“三结合”。即在厂内实行领导、老工人、技术人员三结合，在厂外实行工厂、科研机关、社队群众三结合。这是农机具生产能够多快好省地发展的一条重要经验。要坚持反复试验，不断总结，不断改进，逐步提高，既不要为困难失败所吓倒，又不满足于现有的成就；改革与创新工作都要有重点，要着重抓农民要求最迫切、生产上的关键、花钱较少、收效较大的项目。而要做到这些，必须组织手工业管理部门和厂、社职工到农村社队去蹲点，充分作好调查研究，争取科学研究部门及各有关部门的协助。山西省晋南地区手工业部门，从一九六二年以来，先后组织了有领导干部、技术人员、职工、社员参加的“三结合”小组四百余个、两千多人次，深入到七百多个公社，两千多个生产队进行了调查研究，根据农业实际需要，创制了大量的农机具，供应了当地需要。
    农机具改革运动是亿万农民最关心的大事，是一个伟大的群众运动，必须依靠和发挥广大群众的智慧和积极性，才能搞好。农民往往既是使用者，又是创造者。农业机具的好坏，他们体验得最深刻。因此，农具厂、社制造新农具或者改进旧农具，都必须同社队、农民群众共同商量进行。有些地方采取农民出题目，工人做文章，厂、社改革；农民鉴定，或农民创造，厂、社推广等方法，使工厂和农村社队群众密切结合。这样做不仅有经济和技术上的意义，而且加强了工农联盟，有深远的政治意义。
    为了积极创制和推广半机械化农具，还必须充分发扬自力更生的革命精神。只有强调自力更生的精神，才能调动广大群众的创造力和积极性。自力更生，对于手工业特别重要。手工业厂、社比起现代化企业一般是设备较差，技术较低的。因此，更需依靠群众，自力更生，大搞技术革新。首先要从摆脱笨重体力劳动开始，凡是有条件的地区应当尽快使铁匠放下大锤，实现锻打机械化，逐步实现木工、磨刃机械化。同时，还要积极制造专用工具、设备，自己武装自己，有计划有重点地武装一批农具厂、社，使其发挥支援农业的骨干作用。手工业职工要求改变落后技术的愿望十分强烈，而且具备着进行技术改造的很多有利条件。例如，老工人较多，职工受“洋框框”的影响较少，有一定的家底和较多的生产经验等。全国农具展览会展出的一件上海棉花三麦播种机，很受农民群众的欢迎。它是上海川沙县一个规模很小的厂子——川沙农机厂创制的。这个厂既没有高等技术人员，设备也很简陋，但是他们依靠群众，自力更生，敢想，敢闯，敢创，打破老“框框”，经过反复试验，终于试制成功。
    根据各地发展半机械化农机具的经验，做好工作的根本保证是要事事以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，实现人的思想革命化，切实树立全心全意为农业生产服务的思想。智慧来自群众，革命精神出产品。物质可以变精神，精神可以变物质。只有这样，手工业部门才能为促进农业生产高潮的深入发展、为促进农业机械化的实现做出更大的贡献。（附图片）
