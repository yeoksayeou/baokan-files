    It is a continuous revolutionary process
    -- A Summary of Discussions on the Question of "Serving Whom?"
    On November 8th last year, this newspaper published Comrade Lü Jian's letter, in which he argued that the question of "serving whom?" had been basically resolved among leading cadres of the county committee, and that the current focus should be on solving the question of "how to serve." Since then, the editorial department has received a large number of letters from all walks of life, further exploring the issues of "serving whom?" and "how to serve," with very rich content covering many aspects. In addition to the selected articles already published, a summary of the other letters is published below. - Editor
    
    It is necessary to launch class struggle in one's own mind
    Many letters believe that in today's world with classes and class struggle, the question of "serving whom?" always exists; to truly achieve complete and thorough service to the people is a continuous revolutionary process. Comrade Deng Wangui of Qingdao, Shandong, said: In the entire historical period of transition from capitalism to socialism, there is a struggle between two ideologies and two roads: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. This struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes very fierce. This struggle is bound to be reflected in our Party, in our county committees, and in the minds of each of us, including the leading cadres of the county committee, because each of us cannot be separated from real social life. We must be very clear about this. Only by constantly being aware of the class struggle around us and being vigilant that our own minds may also be interfered with by the ideology of the exploiting classes, can we take the initiative to use proletarian ideology to defeat the ideology of the exploiting classes, thereby ensuring that we serve the people firmly, unswervingly, and thoroughly. Comrade Fu Ruiping of Yangshuo County, Guangxi, said: Chairman Mao told us that the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved. Why is it said that it has not been truly resolved? This is because: there are still class enemies at home and abroad, and they still have considerable influence; the new social system is always conceived from the old social system, and the old ideology, old habits, old traditions, and old styles are constantly influencing the people around us, and also influencing ourselves. If we say that comrades who have been tested by revolutionary struggle, who were once able to "enter the sea of ​​fire and climb the mountain of knives" for the people, can be permanently immune to the influence of bourgeois ideology, this is a metaphysical point of view, and it is also inconsistent with the facts. Otherwise, how can we understand that some comrades who were resolute in the revolution in the past have fallen under the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie? Clearly recognizing the existence of class struggle, especially that there will also be class struggle in each of our minds, can provide a constant force of vigilance and self-discipline, enabling us to unswervingly follow the broad road of "serving the people."
    Comrades Li Baocheng and Qin Wengan of Kunshan County, Jiangsu, said: Many revolutionary martyrs achieved complete and thorough service to the people. Their lives were a continuous revolutionary process, a process of working until old age and serving until death. The letter believes that those who are truly completely and thoroughly for the people will always think that they are not serving the people well enough, and that there are still many "necessities" of serving the people that have not become "freedom." Because complete and thorough service to the people has a certain standard at a certain time, but in the entire process of serving the people, it is endless. Things are always developing and changing. Serving the people well in the past does not necessarily mean that they can serve well today. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the War of Liberation, and in the Land Reform Movement, many comrades served the people very well, but in today's three major revolutionary movements, are there not still many "necessities" that have not become "freedom"? This fully shows that the question of "serving whom?" has not been completely and thoroughly resolved. This proves that we must never be satisfied with past "merits" and "hard work." Comrade Liu Xingqiu of Chaoxian County, Anhui, said: The fighting journey of "mountains of knives and seas of fire," "merits" and "hard work," have no weight in the minds of proletarian revolutionaries; we should, as Comrade Liao Chujiang said, "engage in revolution for a lifetime and study 'serving the people' for a lifetime."
    
    "Serving whom?" is the primary issue
    Some letters pointed out: "Serving whom?" and "How to serve?" are inseparable and interconnected, but the relationship between the first and second must be clarified. The primary thing should be to solve the worldview issue of "serving whom?". Comrade Lü Benyu of Shangqiu County, Henan, said: Through studying revolutionary theory and participating in the practice of revolutionary struggle, our proletarian worldview is established, then we can use this fundamental viewpoint as the general basis for observing any specific thing, as the fundamental method for understanding the world, transforming the world, and transforming ourselves. That is to say, once the question of "serving whom?" is resolved, the question of "how to serve?" will be correspondingly better resolved. This is just like when we understand why we should aid Vietnam and resist the United States, the question of how to aid Vietnam and resist the United States is not a difficult question to solve. Of course, we are not advocates of the "theory of two revolutions." We don't mean that we should first thoroughly resolve the issue of "serving whom?" and then resolve the issue of "how to serve?", but rather that while resolving the issue of "serving whom?", we must also consider how to serve well accordingly. From the current situation, to realize the revolutionization of county committee leadership, the most urgent and crucial thing is to first solve the problem of "serving whom?", and we cannot take the issue of "how to serve?" as the key to realizing revolutionization, or the so-called "crux." If that were the case, it would be wrong in theory and inevitably harmful in practice.
    Comrade Jiang Jing of Fuzhou City, Fujian, said: The leadership method of proletarian revolutionaries is contained within the worldview, that is, the question of "serving whom?". He believes that the diary of Comrade Wang Jie recently published in the newspapers can clearly illustrate this issue. It is precisely because Comrade Wang Jie had the revolutionary spirit of not being afraid of hardship and not being afraid of death that he did a very good job as a squad leader, and his working methods made himself serve the people very well.
    Some readers have raised the following question: Some of our county committee comrades can also do things according to some working methods pointed out by the Party, but why do they always fail to do well, or in other words, why do things often go against their wishes, and the service effect is not good? Comrade Lin Yuzhen of Lunan Yi Autonomous County, Yunnan, said: "Using points to lead the whole area" is a very good leadership method. Some comrades are also enthusiastic about going to the grassroots to squat, and they have created some models, but many models are "not strong enough," and the experience cannot be promoted. Why? Because these comrades have not truly gone deep to squat, they are just "remote controlling" from the office. When they come down, they mostly just take a quick look, and they only look at the flowers, without asking about sowing, cultivation, growth, and results, let alone asking about the ideological situation of the people. Therefore, there are many things of formalism, and they have not been able to obtain good service effects from good leadership methods. What is the problem here? To raise it to a high level, it is difficult to solve the problem of “serving whom” very well, so even if there are good service methods, they will not have good service effects. This is why we must first solve the thinking of “serving whom” in order to serve the people well.

    Arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought
    How to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly? Where do people's correct and effective service methods come from? Many letters have emphasized: It is necessary to earnestly study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, grasp the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, establish a proletarian worldview and scientific methodology. This is the key to solving the question of "serving whom" and "how to serve," and it is also the only way to realize the revolutionization of county committee leadership.
    Comrade Xiong Wenzheng of Huangmei County, Hubei, said: The Party's county committee is the fighting headquarters of a county. The mental state of the leading cadres of the county committee and whether the working methods are correct are related to the fighting will of the cadres and the masses of the entire county, and related to the success or failure of a county in the three major revolutionary movements. To establish a revolutionary mental state and to have correct working methods, the only way is to earnestly study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. How can we talk about using Mao Zedong Thought to take command if we don't study Chairman Mao's works? Comrade He Yulan of Beijing said: The process of revolutionizing many county committees is the process of earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works. The comrades of the Yu County Committee in Shanxi first used Chairman Mao's thought to transform their subjective world, and then mastered the materialist dialectical method of observing and analyzing the objective world, thereby changing the objective world. In just two years, this county changed the productive outlook of the entire county, and grain production increased significantly, setting a brilliant example for a county to learn from Dazhai.
    Many readers pointed out: Generally speaking, everyone has the desire to study Chairman Mao's works, but because they are busy, they often squeeze out their study time; some comrades are hindered from studying hard because they are superstitious about their own work experience; some comrades also reflect that due to the wrong study methods, the effect is not good, and the study cannot be sustained. In the final analysis, there is the question of whether or not to put the study of Mao Zedong's works in the first place of all work. Why can't it be put in the first place? This is because we have not truly realized in our minds that only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we completely and thoroughly solve the questions of "serving whom?" and "how to serve?"

### 是一个不断革命化的过程——关于“为谁服务”问题的讨论综述

    是一个不断革命化的过程
    ——关于“为谁服务”问题的讨论综述
    去年十一月八日，本报发表了吕健同志的来信，他认为：在县委领导干部中，“为谁服务”的问题已经基本解决，当前应当着重解决“怎样服务”的方法问题。此后，编辑部收到来自各行各业的大批信件，对“为谁服务”和“怎样服务”的问题，作了进一步的探讨，内容十分丰富，涉及许多方面。除已选编一部分发表外，把其他来信综述发表如下。　编者
    要在自己头脑里展开阶级斗争
    不少来信认为，在有阶级和阶级斗争的今天，“为谁服务”的问题是始终存在的；要真正做到完全、彻底为人民服务，是一个不断革命化的过程。山东青岛邓万贵同志说：在由资本主义过渡到社会主义的整个历史时期，存在着资产阶级和无产阶级两种思想、两条道路的斗争，这种斗争是长期的、复杂的，有时是十分激烈的。这种斗争必然要反映到我们党内来，反映到我们县委会里，反映到我们每个人的头脑之中，其中当然也包括县委的领导干部，这是因为我们每个人都离不开现实的社会生活。对这一点，我们必须十分清醒，只有时刻意识到在我们周围有阶级斗争，警惕到我们自己的头脑也会受到剥削阶级思想的干扰，才能主动地用无产阶级思想去战胜剥削阶级的思想，从而保证我们坚定不移地，完全彻底为人民服务。广西阳朔县傅瑞平同志说：毛主席告诉我们，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。为什么说没有真正解决呢？这是因为：国内外还存在着阶级敌人，它们还有相当强大的影响；新的社会制度总是从旧的社会制度中孕育出来的，旧的思想意识、旧的习惯势力、旧的传统和旧的作风，无时无刻不在影响着我们周围的人，也影响着我们自己。如果说，经受革命斗争考验的同志，他们为人民曾经能“入火海、上刀山”，就可以一劳永逸地不受资产阶级思想的影响，这是形而上学观点，也是不符合事实的。不然，怎样理解一些往日革命坚决的同志，在资产阶级糖衣炮弹之下倒下去了呢？清醒地认识阶级斗争的存在，特别是在我们每个人的头脑里也会有阶级斗争，就可以有一股经常警惕、鞭策自己的力量，使我们在“为人民服务”这条大道上毫不动摇。
    江苏昆山县李保成、秦文淦同志说：许多革命先烈做到了完全、彻底地为人民服务，他们的一生是一个不断革命化的过程，是干到老，服务到死的过程。来信认为，真正是完全、彻底为人民的人，总会是时时刻刻想到自己为人民服务得很不够，为人民服务的“必然”，还有许多没有成为“自由”。因为完全、彻底为人民服务，在一定的时候有一定的标准，在整个为人民服务的过程中则是无止境的。事物总是不断发展变化，过去为人民服务得很好，今天就未必也能服务得很好。在抗日战争、在解放战争、在土地改革运动中为人民服务得很好的同志，在今天的三大革命运动中，不是还有很多“必然”没有变为“自由”吗？这就充分说明“为谁服务”的问题并没有彻底、完全得到解决。由此证明，我们绝对不能满足于过去的“功劳”和“苦劳”。安徽巢县刘星球同志说：“刀山火海”的战斗历程，“功劳”和“苦劳”，在无产阶级革命家的胸怀里是没有分量的；我们应当象廖初江同志所说的“干一辈子革命，要学一辈子‘为人民服务’。”
    “为谁服务”是第一位的问题
    有些来信指出：“为谁服务”和“怎样服务”是分不开的，相互联系的，但是第一位和第二位的关系必须弄清楚。第一位应当是解决“为谁服务”的世界观问题。河南商丘县吕本玉同志说：我们通过学习革命理论参加革命斗争实践，无产阶级的世界观确立起来了，那么，就可以用这个根本观点作为观察任何具体事物的总的基础，作为认识世界、改造世界也改造自己的根本方法。也就是说，“为谁服务”的问题解决了，“怎样服务”的问题也就相应地比较好解决了。这正如我们明白了为什么要援越抗美，至于如何援越抗美的问题，就不是很难解决的问题了。当然，我们不是“二次革命论”者，不是说先把“为谁服务”的问题解决透了，再来解决“怎样服务”的问题，而是说，在解决“为谁服务”问题的同时，也必须相应地考虑怎样服务得好的问题。从当前情况来看，要实现县委领导革命化，最迫切、最关键的首先是解决“为谁服务”的问题，而不能把“怎样服务”的问题，作为实现革命化的关键，或所谓“症结”。如果是那样，这在理论上是错误的，在实践上也必然是有害的。
    福建福州市江靖同志说：无产阶级革命家的领导方法，包含在世界观、即“为谁服务”这个问题之内。他认为，最近报刊登载王杰同志的日记，可以鲜明地说明这个问题。王杰同志正因为有了一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命精神，所以他当班长就当得很好，他的工作方法就使自己为人民服务得十分出色。
    有些读者提出了这样的问题：我们有些县委同志，也能按照党所指出的一些工作方法去办事，但是，为什么他们总办不好，或者说，往往在有些事情上事与愿违，服务效果并不好呢？云南路南彝族自治县林玉贞同志说：“以点带面”是一项很好的领导方法。有些同志也热心到基层蹲点，搞了一些样板，但是许多样板“不过硬”，经验推不开。为什么呢？因为这些同志并没有真正深入蹲点，只是坐在机关里“遥控”，下来多是走马看花，而且也只限于看花，而不过问播种、栽培、生长和结果，更没有过问人的思想状况，所以形式主义的东西很多，并没有能从好的领导方法里取得好的服务效果。这是个什么问题呢？提到高度来说，是“为谁服务”的问题很好解决，所以即使有了好的服务方法，也起不到好的服务效果。这就是为什么首先要解决“为谁服务”的思想，才能很好地为人民服务的道理。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来
    怎样树立完全、彻底为人民服务的思想？人们正确的、有效的服务方法从何而来呢？许多来信都强调指出：要认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，掌握毛泽东思想的精神实质，树立无产阶级的世界观和科学的方法论，这是解决“为谁服务”和“怎样服务”的钥匙，也是实现县委领导革命化的必由之路。
    湖北黄梅县熊文政同志说：党的县委会，是一个县的战斗司令部，县委领导干部的精神状态如何，工作方法是否对头，这关系到全县干部和群众的战斗意志，关系到一个县在三大革命运动中的成败。要树立革命的精神状态，要具备正确的工作方法，唯一的办法是认真学习毛泽东同志的著作。不学习主席著作，怎么谈得上用毛泽东思想挂帅呢？北京贺玉兰同志说：许多县委革命化的过程，就是认真学习毛主席著作的过程。山西盂县县委的同志们，首先是用主席思想改造自己的主观世界，进而掌握了观察、分析客观世界的唯物辩证方法，从而改变了客观世界。这个县仅仅两年的时间，就改变了全县的生产面貌，粮食产量大幅度上升，为一个县学大寨树立了光辉的榜样。
    不少读者指出：一般来说，大家都有学习主席著作的愿望，因为忙，往往把学习挤掉了；有些同志则因为迷信于自己的工作经验，妨碍了自己去刻苦学习；有些同志还反映，由于学习方法不对头，效果不好，学习也不能坚持下去。归根到底，这里有一个是不是把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作首位的问题。为什么不能放在首位？则又是由于我们思想上没有真正认识到：只有掌握毛泽东思想，才能完全、彻底解决“为谁服务”和“怎样服务”的问题。
