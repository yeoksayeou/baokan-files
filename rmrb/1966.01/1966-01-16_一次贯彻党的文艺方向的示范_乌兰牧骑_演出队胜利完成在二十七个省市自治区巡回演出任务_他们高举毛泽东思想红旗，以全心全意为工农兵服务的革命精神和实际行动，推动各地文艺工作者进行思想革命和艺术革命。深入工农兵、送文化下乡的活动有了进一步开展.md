    A Demonstration of Implementing the Party's Literary and Art Direction
    The "Ulanmuqi" Performance Team Successfully Completes its Tour Performance Task in Twenty-Seven Provinces, Municipalities, and Autonomous Regions
    They hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the revolutionary spirit and practical actions of wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers to promote ideological and artistic revolution among local literary and art workers. Activities of going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers and delivering culture to the countryside have been further developed.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 15th) The three Inner Mongolia "Ulanmuqi" performance teams, which traveled throughout the country for more than half a year, recently successfully completed their task of spreading experience and touring performances in various places. During this "experience-sharing" activity, the "Ulanmuqi" held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the revolutionary spirit and practical actions of wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers to provide a vivid demonstration to literary and art workers in various places on implementing the Party's literary and art direction, becoming a red banner on the cultural revolution front recognized by the vast numbers of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the literary and art circles in various places.
    These three "Ulanmuqi" touring performance teams set off from the capital in early June last year to various places. They successively went to twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, traveling more than 105,000 li. Holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they sowed the seeds of revolutionary culture wherever they went. Under their promotion, activities of literary and art workers going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers and delivering culture to the countryside have been further developed.
    Party and government leading departments, literary and art circles, and the vast numbers of worker, peasant, and soldier audiences in various places attached great importance to and highly evaluated the revolutionary spirit and advanced experience of the "Ulanmuqi." Wherever the "Ulanmuqi" went, the relevant literary and art departments organized observation and learning activities. Some places called for the promotion of the "Ulanmuqi" experience at rural cultural work conferences being held locally, and many literary and art units also sent people to the "Ulanmuqi" to study along with the team. A surge of learning from the "Ulanmuqi" is vigorously unfolding in the national literary and art circles.
    While spreading experience in various places, the "Ulanmuqi" held special performances. At the same time, they took the initiative to go deep into workshops, construction sites, fields, front lines, kitchens, hospitals, and even roadsides, trains, waiting rooms, and the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to offer songs and dances to workers, peasants, and soldiers. They also carried out publicity on current events and policies, carried out service activities, participated in production labor, and did a lot of good things for the masses. Whether at a grand performance attended by tens of thousands of people or at a performance given alone for an elderly poor peasant woman, the "Ulanmuqi" dedicated the best programs to the people with the most serious attitude.
    During this "experience-sharing" activity, the deepest feeling of the literary and art circles in various places was the revolutionary spirit of the "Ulanmuqi" in wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as their short, concise, and capable organizational form and the professional characteristics of being proficient in many skills. When talking about their learning experience, literary and art workers pointed out that the most important of these three aspects is their revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only with this prerequisite can one learn their good ways and methods of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many actors, writers, and directors used the "Ulanmuqi" as a "mirror" to examine their own thoughts and re-studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They more deeply realized that the process of adhering to and implementing the Party's literary and art direction is a long-term and arduous struggle between the proletarian world view and the bourgeois world view. Whether one serves workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly and unconditionally and integrates with workers, peasants, and soldiers, or "serves" workers, peasants, and soldiers half-heartedly and conditionally is the fundamental mark for distinguishing whether a literary and art worker is revolutionary.
    Under the influence of the "Ulanmuqi" demonstrating by their own example, the literary and art workers in various places further strengthened their determination to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. "'What the 'Ulanmuqi' can do, we can also do!'" Encouraged by this thought, many literary and art departments learned while taking action. Some places organized "Ulanmuqi"-style performance teams, and many professional literary and art troupes, based on their own characteristics, formed long-term or short-term touring performance small teams or light cavalry teams to go directly into production teams, workshops, companies, and other grass-roots units to popularize socialist culture. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet, Qinghai, and other places have also established or are planning to establish "Ulanmuqi"-style cultural work teams dedicated to going to the border areas and minority ethnic mountain areas. Actors and performers in various places have also learned from the "Ulanmuqi," maintaining their own specialties while mastering as many new artistic skills as possible in order to better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition, the "Ulanmuqi's" experience of learning while doing in labor, political study, and artistic practice has also attracted the attention of literary and art circles and art colleges in various places. They believe that this is a good method for training young literary and art workers.
    Many literary and art departments have a common experience in learning: learning and applying the experience of the "Ulanmuqi" is an ideological revolution and an artistic revolution, and it is necessary to combine high political enthusiasm with down-to-earth and meticulous work. On the one hand, we must dare to learn greatly and change greatly, break the old and establish the new; on the other hand, we must pay attention to proceeding from reality, combining our own specific conditions and professional characteristics, integrating and understanding, and learning and applying flexibly. Only in this way can we truly learn the revolutionary spirit and experience of the "Ulanmuqi," can we persist in the long term, make discoveries, and create, so that these experiences can truly take root, blossom, and bear fruit in various places.
    The "Ulanmuqi" dedicated a revolutionary red heart to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers also regarded them as their own relatives. In many places, the masses compared the "Ulanmuqi" to the "Old Red Army and Old Eighth Route Army cultural troupes of today," and regarded their performances as bringing the cordial concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, people were very enthusiastic to watch the performances. In the revolutionary famous city of Zunyi, one-third of the residents watched the "Ulanmuqi" performance. In Shanghai, the 20,000 tickets for the "Ulanmuqi" public performance were sold out in less than two hours. It is also often seen that when the "Ulanmuqi" performance is about to end, there are still many people outside the venue, waiting for others to return their tickets. When the "Ulanmuqi" came to Pulan County in Tibet, more than a dozen Tibetan brothers rode horses from dozens of miles away, holding up a big red flag with Chairman Mao's image on it, and welcomed them with gongs and drums. After watching the performances, many workers, peasants, soldiers, and emancipated serfs wrote letters, left messages, and gave souvenirs, entrusting the "Ulanmuqi" to convey their gratitude to Chairman Mao. The Old Red Army soldiers in Jinggangshan, the old peasants in Yan'an, and the soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" gave the "Ulanmuqi" team members thatched bamboo used for flagpoles, long-cherished Red Army relics, and sewing kits, encouraging them to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition, and be proletarian literary and art vanguards who never fade.
    After this period of touring performances, the influence of the "Ulanmuqi" in the country has greatly exceeded the scope of the literary and art circles. In the minds of many people, the "Ulanmuqi" has become a "synonym" for ideological revolutionization and wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some places have established "Ulanmuqi" rural mobile medical teams; many People's Liberation Army soldiers, commercial workers, and government cadres have also expressed their desire to learn from the good style of the "Ulanmuqi" and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some urban educated youth, after watching the performances, firmly demanded to go to the border areas and the most difficult places.
    Everyone is learning from the "Ulanmuqi," so what should the "Ulanmuqi" do? The team members' resounding answer is: always remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty makes one progress, pride makes one lag behind," and always be primary school students of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They not only said this, but also did it earnestly. They regarded this tour performance as the best school, consulted Chairman Mao's works with questions anytime and anywhere, never forgot to look at themselves with the one-divides-into-two viewpoint, regularly checked their thoughts, summarized their work, and humbly learned the revolutionary spirit and advanced experience of workers, peasants, soldiers, and literary and art colleagues.
    As the tour performance has come to a successful conclusion and the "Ulanmuqi" is about to embark on a new journey, the team members unanimously expressed that they must always listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, never be separated from workers, peasants, and soldiers, never be separated from labor, continue the revolution, study diligently and practice hard, hold the revolutionary red banner of the "Ulanmuqi" even higher, and serve workers, peasants, soldiers, socialism, and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world wholeheartedly for the rest of their lives.

    一次贯彻党的文艺方向的示范
    “乌兰牧骑”演出队胜利完成在二十七个省市自治区巡回演出任务
    他们高举毛泽东思想红旗，以全心全意为工农兵服务的革命精神和实际行动，推动各地文艺工作者进行思想革命和艺术革命。深入工农兵、送文化下乡的活动有了进一步开展
    据新华社十五日讯　在半年多时间里走遍全国的内蒙古“乌兰牧骑”三个演出队，最近胜利完成了在各地传播经验和巡回演出的任务。在这次“传经”活动中，“乌兰牧骑”高举毛泽东思想红旗，以全心全意为工农兵服务的革命精神和实际行动，向各地文艺工作者进行了一次贯彻党的文艺方向的生动的示范，成为各地广大工农兵和文艺界公认的文化革命战线上的一面红旗。
    这三个“乌兰牧骑”巡回演出队是去年六月上旬从首都出发到各地去的。他们先后到了二十七个省、市、自治区，行程十万五千多里。他们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，走到那里就把革命文化的种子播到那里。在他们的推动下，各地文艺工作者深入工农兵和送文化下乡的活动，有了进一步的开展。
    各地党政领导部门、文艺界和广大工农兵观众十分重视和高度评价“乌兰牧骑”的革命精神和先进经验。“乌兰牧骑”所到之处，有关文艺部门都组织观摩学习活动，一些地方在当地正在召开的农村文化工作会议上号召推广“乌兰牧骑”的经验，不少文艺单位还派人来到“乌兰牧骑”跟队学习。学习“乌兰牧骑”的热潮正在全国文艺界蓬勃展开。
    “乌兰牧骑”在各地一面传播经验，一面举行专场演出，同时，主动深入车间、工地、田头、前沿阵地、伙房、医院以至公路旁、火车上、候车室和贫下中农社员家里，为工农兵送歌献舞。他们还进行时事政策宣传，开展服务活动，参加生产劳动，为群众做了大量的好事。不论是在有几万人参加的盛大演出会上，还是只给一位贫农老大娘单独演出，“乌兰牧骑”都以最严肃的态度，把最好的节目献给人民。
    在这次“传经”活动中，各地文艺界感受最深的是，“乌兰牧骑”全心全意为工农兵服务的革命精神，以及他们短小精悍的组织形式和一专多能的业务特点。文艺工作者们在谈到学习心得时指出，这三个方面，最主要的还是他们全心全意为工农兵服务的革命精神。有了这个前提，才能学到他们为工农兵服务的好方式和好方法。许多演员、作者、导演们以“乌兰牧骑”做“镜子”，对照检查了自己的思想，重新学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，他们更深刻地认识到：坚持贯彻党的文艺方向的过程就是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观长期艰巨的斗争过程。究竟是全心全意、无条件地为工农兵服务、和工农兵结合，还是半心半意、有条件地为工农兵“服务”，这是鉴别一个文艺工作者是否革命的根本标志。
    各地的文艺工作者们在“乌兰牧骑”现身说法的影响下，进一步坚定了同工农兵结合、为工农兵服务的决心。“‘乌兰牧骑’能做到的，我们也能够做到！”在这样的思想鼓舞下，许多文艺部门边学习，边行动。一些地方组织了“乌兰牧骑”式的演出队，不少专业文艺团体根据本身的特点，分别组成长期或短期的巡回演出小分队或轻骑队，直接深入到生产队、车间、连队等基层单位中去普及社会主义文化。广东、广西、云南、贵州、西藏、青海等地，还成立了或正在筹建专门到边疆和少数民族山区去的“乌兰牧骑”式文化工作队。各地的演员、演奏人员们，也纷纷向“乌兰牧骑”学习，在保持自己专长的同时，尽可能多掌握一些新的艺术本领，以便更好地为工农兵服务。此外，“乌兰牧骑”在劳动、政治学习和艺术实践中边干边学的经验，也引起了各地文艺界和艺术院校的重视。他们认为这是培养青年文艺工作者的一个好方法。
    许多文艺部门在学习中，有一个共同的体会：学习和运用“乌兰牧骑”的经验，是一场思想革命和艺术革命，一定要把高度的政治热情和踏实细致的工作结合起来。一方面要敢于大学大改，破旧立新；另一方面又必须注意从实际出发，结合本身的具体条件和业务特点，融汇贯通，活学活用。只有这样，才能把“乌兰牧骑”的革命精神和经验真正学到手，才能长期坚持下去，有所发现，有所创造，使这些经验真正能够在各地扎根、开花、结果。
    “乌兰牧骑”把一颗革命的红心献给工农兵，工农兵也把他们当做自己的亲人。在许多地方，群众都把“乌兰牧骑”比做是“今天的老红军和老八路文工团”，把他们的演出看做是带来了党中央和毛主席对各族人民的亲切关怀。因此，观看演出的人非常踊跃。在革命名城遵义，有三分之一的居民观看了“乌兰牧骑”的演出。在上海，“乌兰牧骑”公演的两万张入场券不到两小时就全部卖光。还经常可以看到这样的情况：“乌兰牧骑”的演出要结束了，还有很多人在场外，想等到别人的退票。当“乌兰牧骑”来到西藏普兰县时，十多位藏族兄弟骑马从几十里外赶来，高举起贴着毛主席象的大红旗，敲锣打鼓欢迎他们。许多工人、农民、战士、翻身农奴们看了演出以后，纷纷写信留言，赠送纪念品，托“乌兰牧骑”把自己感激的心情转达给毛主席。井冈山的老红军，延安的老农民，“南京路上好八连”的战士们，把做旗杆用的茅竹、珍藏多年的红军遗物和针线包等送给“乌兰牧骑”队员，鼓舞他们高举毛泽东思想红旗，继承和发扬革命传统，做永不褪色的无产阶级文艺尖兵。
    经过这个时期的巡回演出，“乌兰牧骑”在全国的影响已经大大超出了文艺界的范围。“乌兰牧骑”在许多人的心目中已经成为思想革命化和全心全意为工农兵服务的“代名词”。有的地方建立起“乌兰牧骑”农村巡回医疗队；许多解放军战士、商业工作者、机关干部也表示要学习“乌兰牧骑”的好作风，更好地为工农兵服务。有些城市知识青年看过演出，坚决要求到边疆和最艰苦的地方去。
    大家学“乌兰牧骑”，“乌兰牧骑”怎么办？队员们响亮的回答是：永远记住毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，永远做工农兵的小学生。他们不仅这样说，也切实地这样做了。他们把这次巡回演出当做是一个最好的学校，随时随地带着问题请教毛主席著作，时刻不忘以一分为二的观点看待自己，定期检查思想、总结工作，虚心学习工农兵和文艺界同行们的革命精神和先进经验。
    当巡回演出已经胜利结束，“乌兰牧骑”即将走上新的征途的时候，队员们都一致表示，一定要永远听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，永远不脱离工农兵、不脱离劳动，不断革命，勤学苦练，把“乌兰牧骑”这面革命红旗举得更高，为工农兵、为社会主义、为世界人民的革命事业，全心全意服务一辈子。（附图片）
