    People of the World, Rise Up and Stop the Fascist Atrocities of the United States
    American Aggressor Troops Implement Large-Scale "Scorched Earth" Plan in South Vietnam
    Vietnamese Government Strongly Condemns U.S. Imperialism's Extremely Barbaric "Three Alls" Policy
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 11th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 11th, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialism's frantic intensification of the war of aggression against South Vietnam. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    While the U.S. authorities are loudly proclaiming the so-called "peace offensive," the U.S. aggressors and their lackey troops are trying their best to intensify the criminal war they are waging in South Vietnam to an extremely cruel degree.
    According to an Associated Press report on January 6, 1966, "U.S. troops have directly intervened" in implementing a large-scale "scorched earth" plan in South Vietnam. The Associated Press also reported that this plan stipulates that the U.S. Air Force can bomb at will, and the U.S. Army can freely destroy crops, burn down houses and other property of the people, and force the survivors into "settlement camps." They attempt to eliminate all life in vast areas by this method and forcibly force people into disguised concentration camps.
      In order to realize this extremely vicious plan, soldiers of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade have been conducting "sweeps" against a densely populated plain area south of the Dong Van Co River, more than thirty kilometers northwest of Saigon, since January 1, 1966. They regard this area as the main target of the aforementioned "scorched earth" plan. They burned down all the houses they saw there, smashed all the cooking utensils, cut down all the fruit trees, and destroyed all the food. According to Western news agencies, in this bloody "sweep," the U.S. aggressors used all barbaric means, including poison gas, phosphorus incendiary bombs, napalm bombs, and the continuous bombing and strafing of B-52 aircraft, killing 143 people and arresting 676 people.
    At the same time, Reuters also reported that on January 5, 1966, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Da Nang also conducted a "sweep" of the area 16 kilometers southwest of Da Nang, burning down the entire Rong Fang village.
    In addition to the above-mentioned bloody "sweeps," the Saigon military authorities also use the air force on a large scale every day to bomb and strafe various residential areas, committing many crimes against the people of the South. To give just a few figures: on the morning of December 27 and 28, 1965, U.S. aircraft flew 322 sorties, destroying 353 houses, damaging 274 houses and 16 ships (United Press International, December 28, 1965). On January 6, 1966, in one day and night, the U.S. Air Force flew 319 sorties, destroying and damaging 497 houses (Saigon Radio, January 7, 1966). On January 7, 1966, the U.S. Air Force flew 423 sorties, destroying and damaging 601 houses (United Press International, January 8, 1966).
    The above-mentioned two "scorched earth" sweeps by the U.S. paratroopers and Marine Corps, as well as the U.S.'s open use of chemical poisons and toxic gases as "clearly defined principles" for each "sweep," and the use of a concentrated air force, including B-52 strategic bombers, to carry out frenzied bombing of various residential areas in the South, all show that the U.S. imperialism, which has reached the end of its road, is waging a destructive war of aggression in South Vietnam in order to save its inevitable defeat.
    While carrying out the above-mentioned criminal activities, U.S. imperialism is also further intensifying the war in South Vietnam. They are sending more troops to Pleiku, increasing the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam to nearly 190,000. U.S. military leaders such as the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Commander of the Marine Corps have successively come to South Vietnam to urge the expansion of aggressive war activities.
    Regarding North Vietnam, the U.S. Air Force is still constantly conducting reconnaissance and provocative activities. On January 4, 1966, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Wheeler blatantly threatened to resume bombing and threatened to use B-52 aircraft to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    It is obvious that while the U.S. authorities are shouting about their so-called "peace sincerity" and "unconditional discussions," they are trying their best to intensify their criminal war of aggression in South Vietnam to a more cruel degree, while preparing to continue a larger-scale destructive war against North Vietnam with the air force. U.S. President Johnson's hypocritical rhetoric and deceptive means of "peace efforts" cannot conceal the extremely brutal true face of the U.S. aggressors.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly accuses world opinion of the above-mentioned extremely barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam and the U.S. plot to prepare for new military adventures in Vietnam.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the strong statement issued by the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on January 5, 1966, demanding that the United States must stop all military actions, must stop using poison gas and chemical poisons, and must immediately abandon the barbaric policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all" in South Vietnam. The United States must withdraw all U.S. and its puppet troops from South Vietnam, must permanently and unconditionally stop all actions that violate the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must respect the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, and let the people of South Vietnam solve their own internal affairs.
    No amount of brutal action, no amount of modern weapons, and no amount of vicious means can save U.S. imperialism and its lackeys from their already obvious defeat in South Vietnam. On the contrary, the more brutal and vicious U.S. imperialism is, the more it exposes its despicable and extremely stubborn face of aggression in front of the people of the world, and the more it deepens the hatred of the Vietnamese people, who will resolutely defeat it.
    For the national independence and peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Vietnamese people are determined not to fear hardship and sacrifice. The Vietnamese people firmly believe in their united strength, and with the increasing and effective assistance of fraternal socialist countries and the peace-loving and justice-upholding people of the world, they are determined to carry out the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to complete victory.

### 全世界人民起来制止美国的法西斯暴行  美国侵略军在越南南方推行大规模“焦土”计划  越南政府强烈控诉美帝极端野蛮的“三光”政策

    全世界人民起来制止美国的法西斯暴行
    美国侵略军在越南南方推行大规模“焦土”计划
    越南政府强烈控诉美帝极端野蛮的“三光”政策
    新华社河内十一日电　越南民主共和国外交部十一日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义疯狂强化侵略越南南方的战争。声明全文如下：
    在美国当局大肆宣扬所谓“和平攻势”的时候，美国侵略者及其走狗的军队却竭力把他们在越南南方进行的罪恶战争强化到极其残酷的程度。
    据美联社一九六六年一月六日报道，“美军已经直接插手”在越南南方实现一个大规模的“焦土”计划。美联社还报道，这一计划规定美国空军可以随意进行轰炸，美国陆军可以放手破坏庄稼、烧毁民房和人民的其他财产，强迫幸存的人到“定居营”里去。他们企图以这种方法消灭广大地区内的一切生命，并用武力强迫人民到变相的集中营里去。
      为了实现这一极其恶毒的计划，美国第一七三空降旅士兵自一九六六年一月一日开始对距离西贡西北偏西三十多公里的东万古河以南的一个居民稠密的平原地区进行“扫荡”。他们把这个地区当作上述“焦土”计划的主要目标。他们在那里把他们所见到的房屋都烧光，把所有的烹饪用具打得粉碎，砍倒所有的果树，破坏所有的粮食。据西方通讯社报道，美国侵略者在这次血腥的“扫荡”中，采用了包括毒气、磷燃烧弹、凝固汽油弹和使用B—52型飞机连续轰炸扫射等一切野蛮手段，杀害了一百四十三人，逮捕了六百七十六人。
    在同一时间内，路透社也报道，一九六六年一月五日，驻在岘港的美国海军陆战队也向距离岘港西南十六公里的地区进行“扫荡”，烧光了整个荣芳村。
    除了上述的血腥“扫荡”以外，西贡军事当局还每天大规模地使用空军，向各个居民集中区进行轰炸和扫射，对南方人民犯下许多罪行。仅以几个数字为例：一九六五年十二月二十七日和二十八日上午，美国飞机出动三百二十二架次，炸毁房屋三百五十三间，破坏二百七十四间和十六艘船（合众国际社一九六五年十二月二十八日电）。一九六六年一月六日一昼夜，美国空军出动三百一十九架次，炸毁和破坏民房四百九十七间（西贡电台一九六六年一月七日消息）。一九六六年一月七日，美国空军出动四百二十三架次，炸毁和破坏房屋六百零一间（合众国际社一九六六年一月八日电）。
    美国伞兵和海军陆战队进行的上述两次“焦土”扫荡，以及美国公开使用化学毒药和毒气看作是给各次“扫荡”“明确规定的原则”和使用包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的一支集中空军力量对南方各居民区进行狂轰滥炸等所有行动表明：已经走到穷途末路的美帝国主义，为了挽救它们不可避免的失败，正在越南南方进行一场毁灭性的侵略战争。
    美帝国主义在进行上述罪恶活动的同时，还正在进一步加紧强化越南南方的战争。它们正在增派军队进驻波来古，使在越南南方的美军增加到近十九万名。美国的陆军部长、空军部长、参谋长联席会议主席、陆军参谋长和海军陆战部队司令等军事要员接连前来越南南方，督促扩大侵略战争的活动。
    对于越南北方，美国空军仍然不断进行侦察和挑衅活动。一九六六年一月四日，美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒明目张胆地恫吓要恢复轰炸，恫吓要使用B—52型飞机轰炸越南民主共和国。
    很明显，美国当局在叫嚷它们的所谓“和平诚意”和“无条件讨论”的时候，又竭力把它们在越南南方进行的罪恶的侵略战争强化到更加残酷的地步，同时准备用空军继续对越南北方进行更大规模的破坏性战争。美国总统约翰逊的假仁假义论调和“和平努力”的欺诈手段，掩盖不了美国侵略者极其残暴的真面目。
    越南民主共和国政府向世界舆论强烈控诉美帝国主义及其走狗在越南南方的上述极端野蛮的罪行和美国在越南准备新的军事冒险的阴谋。
    越南民主共和国政府完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六六年一月五日的强有力的声明，要求美国必须停止各种军事行动，必须停止使用毒气和化学毒药，必须立即放弃在越南南方的“杀光、烧光、毁光”的野蛮政策。美国必须把美国及其仆从的军队全部撤出越南南方，必须永远和无条件地停止侵犯越南民主共和国领土的一切行动，必须尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，让越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务。
    任何一种残暴的行动，任何一种现代化武器，任何一种恶毒的手段，都挽救不了美帝国主义及其走狗在越南南方的已经十分明显的失败。相反，美帝国主义越是残暴和恶毒，就越在世界人民面前暴露它的卑鄙和极端顽固的侵略面目，就越加深越南人民的仇恨，越南人民将坚决打败它。
    为了印度支那和东南亚的民族独立与和平，越南人民决不怕艰苦牺牲。越南人民坚信自己的团结力量，并且在各社会主义兄弟国家和全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民的日益巨大和有效的援助下，决心把抗美救国的抗战进行到完全胜利。
