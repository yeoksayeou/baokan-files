    New Achievements in the Revolutionization of Cantonese Opera
    ——On the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe's Performance of "Mountain Village Storm"
    Zhang Ying
    Just as the whole country is surging with the high tide of socialist revolution and construction, the literary and drama circles are also holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and vigorously performing revolutionary modern dramas. Many local opera genres have come to the capital with new postures and with their own created revolutionary modern dramas, which has greatly encouraged and spurred the audience and drama circles in the capital. Now, the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe is also performing in Beijing with this new posture, bringing a revolutionary modern drama. I watched the first performance with great anticipation, and then watched the second and third times, feeling very excited and satisfied; each time I watched, I discovered new things that are worth learning from.
    Cantonese opera is one of the older local opera genres in China. Its development is roughly the same as other local opera genres, but also somewhat different. Before liberation, it was ruled by feudal ideas for a long time, and was also severely eroded by colonialist culture, suffering the most persecution. Cantonese opera, truly loved by the broad masses, was almost on the verge of extinction. After liberation, under the glorious guidance of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, Cantonese opera workers, after more than ten years of efforts, have given it a new life, and have performed some relatively healthy plays. During the years of the Great Leap Forward, they also performed real modern dramas, such as "Red Flower Ridge" and "Liu Hulan." Over the past year or so, the whole country has been vigorously performing revolutionary modern dramas. The comrades of the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe, after going deep into the countryside and the army, transforming their thinking, and experiencing life, are also working hard to create and perform revolutionary modern dramas. As they themselves said, they have experienced many difficulties, made various explorations, and also had failed experiences. Indeed, due to certain special factors of Cantonese opera, it is more difficult to achieve revolutionization, and it requires greater effort. Therefore, the significance of the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe's successful performance of "Mountain Village Storm" is not only that it solves the problem that Cantonese opera must and can completely perform revolutionary modern dramas well; it also marks that the development of Cantonese opera has stepped onto a truly revolutionary new stage in all aspects.
    The Cantonese opera "Mountain Village Storm" is adapted from the full-length novel "Mountain Village Storm Records." It describes a people's guerrilla team in South China in 1947, who were ordered to advance into the mountainous area, mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and use the method of internal and external cooperation to break through the stubborn fortress of the feudal bully landlord Taoyuan Fort in this mountainous area, and establish a mountain base area, effectively cooperating with the national counter-offensive. The script selects dramatic chapters from the novel, and through the depiction of sharp enemy-versus-ours struggles, it creates a positive character image of Liu Qin, the female company commander of the people's guerrilla team. The script writes about the importance of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses in the people's war, and once again vividly illustrates that once the people are awakened, they can defeat any seemingly powerful enemy. The theme of the script is clear, the structure is concentrated and refined, the plot is fascinating, and the levels are distinct. Several main characters have personalities and their images are also vivid.
    I especially appreciate several scenes: The first scene seems to be just a passing scene, only lasting ten minutes, but it introduces the excellent situation of the national revolution and the main characters of the enemy and ourselves. The performance uses the traditional ancient arrangements of Cantonese opera and develops it, using the traditional "Five Watches" tune to sing the heroic aspirations of the guerrillas. At the same time, it also outlines the sinister and viciousness of Lianfang Brigade Captain Zhanweishe and the ugliness of the enemy army. The two armies form a strong contrast, with appropriate exaggeration without losing its truthfulness. The script is concise and the director handles it cleanly in this scene. In the fourth scene, Liu Qin accepts orders from her superiors to go deep into the tiger's den as a teacher at Taoyuan Fort Middle School to understand the enemy's situation. In this scene, almost all the main characters appear. Liu Qin is initially angered by the man-eating scene in this den of tigers and wolves, then encounters the cunning bandit agent Zhanweishe, and is interrogated by the landlord bully Fanguiwang, with Hei Niu confronting him on the spot. The struggle is complex and the plot is thrilling. However, the playwright and director handled it in an orderly manner, with distinct layers. The seventh scene was originally approaching the climax of the whole play. As the curtain opens, in a quiet room, Liu Qin profoundly recites Lu Xun's poem: "My heart is vast and connected to the universe, listening to thunder in silence." Then she sings a long passage of Bangzi slow tempo turning into medium tempo, expressing Liu Qin's feelings of approaching victory after going deep into the tiger's den and going through arduous work, as well as the lofty ideals and revolutionary heroism of this revolutionary fighter. The arrangement of this scene is not only a clever use of the screenwriter's skills, but also a very necessary touch for the shaping of Liu Qin. Because Liu Qin's thoughts, feelings, and mental outlook were not rich and colorful enough in the previous scenes, this scene makes her appear more complete and full, and the characteristics of Cantonese opera are also more prominent. From an artistic point of view, from Liu Qin's lyrical atmosphere, it turns into Hu Zi going down the mountain, with Zhanweishe biting tightly, pushing the dramatic conflict to another climax, holding the audience's heartstrings. The screenwriter and director of "Mountain Village Storm" have noticed that there should not only be drama and people, but also singing and acting, and there is still room in the tense and complex conflict to allow the actors to play to their strengths. This is an important factor in making it not lose the style of Cantonese opera.
    Many audiences have the impression that the lyrics of traditional Cantonese opera are mostly formal and relatively outdated. "Mountain Village Storm" also made revolutionary attempts in the lyrics, and some of the lyrics are quite literary. For example, the four sentences of "Five Watches" sung by the squad leader and soldiers in the first scene are written with great vigor, and then Liu Qin sings that passage of "Fast Cross Qing Medium Tempo," which also writes out the character's mind in this situation, and it is also easy for the actors to sing. Another example is the duet between He Feng and Liu Qin in the third scene: "...How can the master be willing to let go of the slave? Suffering is like blowing a Xiao flute, either way it is bleak." "The Xiao flute can play hundreds of tunes, and those who know how to play it are different. How can life be all bleak..." This is the language extracted from the rich and colorful language of the masses. To create revolutionary new operas, it is very necessary to absorb nutrients from the rich and colorful language of the masses. Zhanweishe's singing and Bai are also quite characteristic. The achievement of "Mountain Village Storm" lies in that it is both a revolutionary modern drama and Cantonese opera; it not only provides the audience with revolutionary education, but also artistic appreciation. Under the efforts of the comrades of the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe, they have expressed revolutionary content in inheriting and developing the excellent traditional art of Cantonese opera, and have taken a very meaningful step for the revolutionization of Cantonese opera.
    The adaptation of the script is not completely without shortcomings. For example, the play's depiction of the basic masses' awakening seems to be too low, making Liu Qin's entry into the fort lack reliable and inevitable conditions for victory; in particular, the clue of He Feng and his daughter accounts for a large proportion in the play, but it does not completely integrate their awakening transformation with the development of the entire dramatic conflict. The ending of the drama is not clear and powerful enough to stir up the masses' anger of resistance and cooperate with the army's attack. I believe that these shortcomings can be completely improved in the process of continuous improvement of this play.
    It is rare to gather so many famous actors loved by the masses in one play on the Cantonese opera stage. In particular, these actors, no matter what role they play, perform a play with full revolutionary enthusiasm and cooperation, which is also an important sign of the revolutionization of Cantonese opera and the ideological revolutionization of actors. It is said that when the Cantonese Opera Troupe was rehearsing "Mountain Village Storm," five actors (including two old actors and three young actors) were selected for the role of Liu Qin at the same time. Everyone compared, learned, caught up, and helped each other. Finally, the best one was selected to participate in the performance after mass evaluation. This highly responsible spirit for the revolutionary drama cause is worth learning from.
    The success of the performance of "Mountain Village Storm" is very important because of the success of the actors' performances. The entire cast is very neat. Comrade Hong Xiannv, who is familiar to the audience in the capital, plays the female company commander of the guerrilla team this time, which is very different from any role she has created in the past, not only because the era is different, but also because the ideological and spiritual outlook of the characters are different; At the same time, judging from her performance expertise and the qualities she possesses as an actor, Comrade Hong Xiannv has greater difficulties in playing Liu Qin. However, because she has the correct attitude of "to perform revolutionary drama, first be a revolutionary person," and has continuously gone deep into the countryside and the army, absorbed the nourishment of artistic creation in the lives of the people, and worked meticulously to create, constantly listening to the opinions of the masses and continuously improving, Liu Qin is played quite successfully. In the first scene, she made her debut with a full political enthusiasm, singing Cross Qing Medium Tempo. Some places have changed the traditional Danjiao's body movements and singing, allowing the audience to see a heroic female soldier. In the fourth scene, at Liu Liiren's house, the performance was very detailed when the anger was aroused from seeing the cannibalistic scene, and then thinking about her mission; the wit of fighting with Zhanweishe also showed the resourcefulness of the revolutionary fighters. The lyrical singing in the study in the sixth scene is both gentle and tactful, and generous and heroic; it not only maintains the advantages of her performance, but also has some development. When creating Liu Qin, Comrade Hong Xiannv tried her best to get rid of her past habits and qualities of being good at performing delicate and weak women, and highlighted Liu Qin's rough personality. This effort has achieved results, allowing the audience to see the real image of the female company commander of the guerrilla team.
    Comrade Luo Pinchao's Changkao Wusheng operas were loved by the audience in the past. Since the vigorous performance of revolutionary modern dramas, Comrade Luo Pinchao has successfully played contemporary positive characters in dramas such as "The Great Wall of the South China Sea." This time, playing Hei Niu in "Mountain Village Storm," it should be said that the script's description of this character is not sufficient, and the performance is also far from the genre he is good at. However, Comrade Luo Pinchao meticulously created a character image of a poor background who was also stained with rogue habits. He does not have many scenes. In the third scene, when he meets Liu Qin, this Hei Niu has rogue habits and no class consciousness. However, Comrade Luo Pinchao did not uglify him, but showed his honest and straightforward side, so in the fifth scene, facing the fierce behavior of the landlord bully, and after Liu Qin's education, his class consciousness was aroused, and he resolutely transformed, which also felt credible. Comrade Wen Juefei is a famous clown in Cantonese opera. He plays Zhanweishe, the Kuomintang bandit agent "Three Dynasties Veteran." His performance has appropriate exaggeration, but he did not use self-expression and self-intoxication to cartoonize this character. He played it with depth, allowing the audience to see that this sinister, vicious, and cunning bad guy is not simple. If Zhanweishe is played shallowly, it will not highlight Liu Qin's wit and bravery. Comrade Wen Juefei's singing and performance are unique, but they are in harmony with the entire play, which shows that he has a fairly high artistic accomplishment. Comrade Luo Jiabao, who plays He Feng, was originally a Xiaosheng, but this time he plays an old hired peasant who has suffered oppression and hardships. His performance is simple, natural, real, and moving. Comrade Huang Chaoquan, who plays Principal Lin, has very few scenes, but he has performed the spirit of a underground party member who is steady, experienced, and able to make decisive decisions. In the sixth scene, when Liu Qin is in a very critical situation, he suddenly appears as a underground party member. The audience sees him taking off his glasses to think about countermeasures, and decisively connects the party relationship with Liu Qin in front of the enemy. Originally, this scene was written somewhat abruptly, but the actors performed it naturally and credibly. It is true that few scenes can also show talent. The young actress Zheng Peiying is responsible and lovely in the role of Chunhua. In short, the entire cast is not only neat, but also serious and responsible in artistic creation, which deeply attracts and touches the audience.
    From the entire play, from the reform of the cast, genres, singing, acting, and so on, it can be seen that the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe is using a revolutionary spirit to create and perform "Mountain Village Storm." And their efforts have been successful. The experience they have gained has laid a solid foundation for the further revolutionization of Cantonese opera. Under the great situation of the country's construction advancing rapidly, at the beginning of the new year, as the audience in the capital, we are happy to see the new achievements made by the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe! We believe that after this successful performance, in the near future, we will definitely see new Cantonese operas that reflect the great socialist era and shape contemporary heroic figures, which are more artistically perfect and revolutionary.

    粤剧革命化的新成就
    ——谈广东粤剧院演出的《山乡风云》
    张颖
    正当全国掀起社会主义革命和建设高潮的时候，文艺戏剧界也高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗，大演革命现代戏。曾有许多地方剧种以新的姿态、带着各自创作的革命现代戏来首都演出，使首都的观众和戏剧界受到极大的鼓舞和鞭策。现在广东粤剧院也正是以这种新姿态、带着革命现代戏到北京演出来了。我怀着热烈期待的心情看了第一次，接着又看了第二、第三次，感到十分兴奋、满意；每看一次我都发现有新的东西，值得好好学习。
    粤剧是我国比较古老的地方剧种之一，它的发展和其他地方剧种大致一样又有所不同。解放以前，它被封建思想长期统治，又受到殖民主义文化的严重侵蚀，受到迫害最重。真正被广大群众所喜闻乐见的粤剧，几乎濒于灭亡的境地。解放以后，在毛泽东文艺思想光辉指引下，粤剧工作者经过十几年的努力，使它得到了新生，演出了一些比较健康的剧目。在大跃进的年代，也曾演出过真正的现代戏，如《红花岗》、《刘胡兰》等。一年多来，全国大演革命现代戏，广东粤剧院的同志们，经过深入农村、部队，改造思想，体验生活，也在努力编演革命现代戏，正如他们自己所说的，历过不少艰难，作过各种探索，也有过失败的经验。确实如此，由于粤剧的某些特殊因素，使它作到革命化有更多的困难，需要付出更大的努力。所以这次广东粤剧院成功地演出了《山乡风云》的意义，就不只是解决了粤剧必须、也完全可以演好革命现代戏的问题；同时也标志着粤剧的发展，在各个方面都跨上了真正革命化的新阶段。
    粤剧《山乡风云》，是根据长篇小说《山乡风云录》改编的。描写一九四七年华南地区的一支人民游击队，奉命挺进山区，发动群众，组织群众，并运用里应外攻的办法，攻破了这一山区中封建恶霸地主的顽固堡垒桃园堡，建立起山区根据地，有力地配合了全国大反攻。剧本选取了小说中富有戏剧性的章节，通过描写尖锐的敌我斗争，塑造了一个人民游击队女连长刘琴的正面人物形象。剧本写出了在人民战争中发动群众、依靠群众的重要意义，再一次形象地说明：人民群众一经觉醒起来，就能打败任何貌似强大的敌人。剧本主题思想鲜明，结构集中精炼，戏剧情节引人入胜，层次分明。几个主要人物有性格，形象还生动。
    我特别欣赏其中几场：第一场看来只是过场戏，只演了十分钟，却把全国革命的大好形势，敌我双方的主要人物都介绍出来了。演出运用粤剧传统的古老排场加以发展，用传统的“五更头”曲牌，唱出了游击队员们的豪情壮志。同时也勾勒出联防大队长斩尾蛇的阴险毒辣和敌军的丑态。两军形成了强烈的对比，有适度的夸张，又不失于真实。这场戏，剧本写得精炼，导演处理得干净。第四场，刘琴接受上级命令，作为桃园堡中学的教师，深入虎穴，了解敌情。在这场戏中，几乎所有的主要人物都上场了。刘琴一开始就被这虎狼窝中的吃人景象所激怒，接着遇上了狡猾的匪特斩尾蛇，又被地主恶霸番鬼王盘查，黑牛当场对质。斗争复杂，情节惊险。但编剧和导演却处理得有条不乱，层次分明。第七场，本来这已经接近全剧的高峰。幕一拉开，在幽静的居室里，刘琴深沉地独白出鲁迅的诗句：“心事浩茫连广宇，于无声处听惊雷”。而后接唱长段的梆子慢板转中板，抒发了刘琴从深入虎穴，经过艰苦的工作，而今接近胜利的心情，也抒发了这个革命战士的远大胸怀和革命豪情。这段戏的安排，不仅是编剧技巧的巧妙运用，而且对刘琴的塑造也是非常必要的一笔。因为刘琴的思想感情和精神面貌，在前几场中还表现得不够丰富多采，而这段戏则使她显得比较丰满完整了，粤剧的特点也更突出。从艺术效果上看，从刘琴这样抒情的气氛，一转而为虎子下山，斩尾蛇紧紧咬住，把戏剧矛盾推到又一高峰，扣紧了观众的心弦。《山乡风云》的编剧和导演都注意到，不仅要有戏有人，还要有唱有做，在紧张复杂的矛盾斗争中还留有余裕，使演员能发挥所长。这是使它不失掉粤剧风格的重要因素。
    不少观众都有这样的印象：粤剧传统戏的唱词多是文绉绉的，而且比较陈旧。《山乡风云》在唱词上也作了革命化的尝试，有些唱词还写得颇具文采。如第一场班长和战士们唱的四句“五更头”，写得很有气魄，接着刘琴唱那段“快十字清中板”，也写出了在此情景中人物的胸怀，演员唱起来也上口。又如第三场何奉与刘琴的对唱：“……主家怎肯将奴才放？受气犹如吹箫笛，横直一样是凄凉。”“箫笛能翻百样腔，识者吹来不一样，做人那会都是凄凉……”这是从群众生活中提炼出的语言。创作革命化的新戏曲，非常需要从群众丰富多采的语言中吸取养分。斩尾蛇的唱和白也相当性格化。《山乡风云》的成就就在于：既是革命现代戏，又是粤剧；既使观众受到了革命教育，又得到了艺术欣赏的满足。在广东粤剧院同志们的努力下，已经在继承和发展粤剧的优秀传统艺术中表现了革命的内容，为粤剧革命化迈出非常有意义的一步。
    剧本改编也不是完全没有缺点的，比如全剧对基本群众的觉悟，描写得似乎过低了些，使刘琴进堡缺少可靠的必然胜利的条件；特别是何奉父女的线索，在剧中比重较大，却没有把他们的觉悟转变和整个戏剧矛盾发展完全交融起来。戏剧的结尾对鼓起群众的反抗怒潮、配合部队进攻，也不够鲜明有力。我相信，这些缺点在这个剧目的不断提高的过程中，是完全可以改得更好的。
    在一台戏中，萃集了这样多被群众所热爱的著名演员，这在粤剧舞台上是不多见的。特别是这些演员，不管自己担任什么角色，都以充沛的革命热情、通力合作来演好一台戏，这也是粤剧革命化、演员思想革命化的重要标志。听说粤剧院在排演《山乡风云》时，刘琴一角就同时挑了五个演员（其中两个老演员，三个青年演员）大家比学赶帮，最后经过群众评比，最好的才参加演出。这种对革命戏剧事业的高度负责精神是值得学习的。
    《山乡风云》演出的成功，很重要一面是演员表演的成功。全台演员非常整齐，首都观众较熟悉的红线女同志，这次扮演游击队女连长，和她以往所创作的任何角色都大不一样，不仅是时代不同，人物的思想精神面貌各异；同时以她的表演特长，和作为一个演员所具备的素质来看，红线女同志演刘琴是有着较大的困难的。但由于她以“要演革命戏，先做革命人”的正确态度，并曾不断深入农村、部队，在人民生活中吸取艺术创作的营养，又一丝不苟地进行创作，时时倾听群众意见，不断改进，所以刘琴是演得相当成功的。第一场她怀着饱满的政治热情，以“锣边花”上场亮相，接着唱十字清中板，其中有些地方改变了传统旦角的身段和唱腔，使观众看到了一个英姿勃勃的女兵。第四场在刘立人家，从看到吃人景象激起了愤怒，转而又想到自己的任务这段戏，表演得非常细致；与斩尾蛇的斗智也演出了革命战士的机智。第六场在书房的一段抒情演唱，既有柔和婉转，又有慷慨豪情；既保持了自己表演的优点，又有所发展。红线女同志在创造刘琴时，极力摆脱她过去善于表演纤纤弱女子的那种习惯和素质，突出刘琴的粗犷性格，这个努力是取得了成果的，使观众看到了游击队女连长的真实形象。
    罗品超同志过去演的长靠武生戏是观众喜爱的，在大演革命现代戏以来，罗品超同志曾在《南海长城》等剧中成功地扮演了当代正面人物。这次在《山乡风云》中扮演黑牛，应该说剧本对这个人物描写是不够充分的，演出又离开了他擅长的行当。但罗品超同志却一丝不苟地创造出一个贫苦出身、而又沾染了流氓习气的人物形象。他的戏不多，第三场与刘琴相遇，这个黑牛带着流氓习气、毫无阶级觉悟。但罗品超同志没有丑化他，而是表现出他憨厚直率的一面，所以到第五场，面对着恶霸地主的凶狠行为，又经过刘琴的教育，激发了他的阶级觉悟，毅然转变，也就觉得可信。文觉非同志是粤剧名丑，他扮演国民党匪特“三朝元老”斩尾蛇，他的表演有适度的夸张，但却没有用自我表现、自我陶醉来把这个人物漫画化，演得有深度，使观众看到这个阴险毒辣又诡计多端的坏蛋并不简单。如果把斩尾蛇演浅了，就衬托不出刘琴的机智勇敢。文觉非同志的唱腔、表演是独创一格的，但又和整台戏和谐，这说明他有相当高的艺术素养。扮演何奉的罗家宝同志本来是演小生的，这次却演一个深受压迫、历尽艰辛的老雇农，演来朴素自然，真实动人。扮演林校长的黄超全同志戏虽很少，而把一个地下党员那种稳重、有经验、又能当机立断的精神面貌演出来了。第六场当刘琴处于非常危急的情况下，他突然以地下党员的身分出现，观众看他取下眼镜思谋对策，而断然在敌人面前和刘琴接上党的关系。本来这场戏写得有些突然，演员却演得自然可信，真是戏少也能显才华。青年演员郑培英演的春花也称职可爱。总之，全台演员不只阵容整齐，艺术创作也都严肃认真，使这出戏深深地吸引和打动了观众。
    从整台戏，从演员阵容、行当、唱腔、做工等等方面的改革，都可以看出广东粤剧院是以革命的精神来编演《山乡风云》的。而且他们的努力得到了成功。他们所取得的经验，为粤剧进一步革命化打下了稳固的基础。在祖国建设一日千里的大好形势下，新的一年正在开始的时候，作为首都的观众，为能看到广东粤剧院取得这样的新成就而感到高兴！我们相信，经过这次成功的演出，在不久将来，我们一定能看到反映社会主义伟大时代和塑造当代英雄人物的、在艺术上更完美的革命化的新粤剧。（附图片）
