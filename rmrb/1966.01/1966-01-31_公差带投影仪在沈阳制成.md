    Tolerance Band Projector Made in Shenyang
    This instrument can replace measuring tools such as micrometers, calipers, and ring gauges for checking the precision of mechanical parts.
    A new type of optical instrument – the tolerance band projector – has been successfully trial-produced by the Shenyang Camera Factory.
    This instrument can replace measuring tools such as micrometers, calipers, and ring gauges for checking the precision of mechanical parts. It can simultaneously check the precision of several to more than a dozen dimensions of a part, increasing efficiency by several to more than ten times compared to manual inspection using micrometers, calipers, ring gauges, and other tools to check each part individually.
    This tolerance band projector has a simple structure, is easy to move, and is most suitable for enterprises with mass production to check parts with a precision of 0.03 millimeters or more. The maximum size of the parts it inspects can reach about 60 millimeters in diameter. Under multi-light source conditions, it can also inspect parts up to 200 millimeters long.

    公差带投影仪在沈阳制成
    这种仪器可以代替千分尺、卡板和环规等量具，用来检查机械零件的精度
    一种新型光学仪器——公差带投影仪已经由沈阳市照象机厂试制成功。
    这种仪器可以代替千分尺、卡板和环规等量具，用来检查机械零件的精度。它能够同时检查一种零件的几个到十几个尺寸的精度，比人工用千分尺、卡板和环规等工具逐个部位进行检查效率提高几倍到十几倍。
    这种公差带投影仪结构简单，便于移动，最适合于大批量生产的企业用来检查精度在零点零三毫米以上的零件。它检查的零件，最大尺寸可以达到直径六十毫米左右。在多光源的条件下，它还可以检查长达二百毫米的零件。
