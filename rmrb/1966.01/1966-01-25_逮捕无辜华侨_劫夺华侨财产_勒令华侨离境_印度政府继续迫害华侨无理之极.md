    Arresting Innocent Overseas Chinese, Plundering Overseas Chinese Property, Ordering Overseas Chinese to Leave the Country
    The Indian Government Continues to Persecute Overseas Chinese Unreasonably
    Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- The Indian government continues to persecute overseas Chinese in India.
    After the Indian government launched a large-scale armed attack on China in October 1962, it threw large numbers of innocent overseas Chinese into prisons and concentration camps. According to some overseas Chinese who recently returned to their homeland from India, there are still hundreds of innocent overseas Chinese illegally detained by the Indian government in the Deoli concentration camp and prisons in Calcutta, Mumbai, Nagaon, and other places in India. They continue to be mistreated in the concentration camps and prisons.
    The Indian government also continues to plunder the property of overseas Chinese as "enemy property." The Indian newspaper *The Statesman* reported on August 25, 1965, that "the Indian government has decided that the 'Custodian of Enemy Property' will auction the property in Kalimpong and Darjeeling of overseas Chinese who have returned to China from the Deoli concentration camp. The property in Kalimpong is worth approximately 150,000 rupees." After overseas Chinese who ran a leather factory in Tangra near Calcutta were arrested by the Indian authorities, the leather factory was also taken over as "enemy property."
    Zhao Guo and his wife, overseas Chinese who had been employed by All India Radio for many years at the invitation of the Indian government, demanded that the Indian government pay them more than 19,000 rupees in wages they were due during their time working in India after breaking through the Indian government's heavy persecution and returning to their homeland. The Indian government even claimed that the ownership of this sum of money now belonged to the "Custodian of Enemy Property," attempting to write off the debt it owed.
    From the beginning of 1964 to the present, the Indian government has again ordered fifteen peaceful and law-abiding overseas Chinese to leave the country within a certain period. After some overseas Chinese sailors go to sea with their ships, the Indian authorities also do not allow them to return to India to reunite with their families.
    Many overseas Chinese in Calcutta work in shipyards, but since March of last year, the Indian government has refused to issue passes to overseas Chinese to enter the shipyard area, forcing overseas Chinese to be unable to continue working in the shipyards. The Indian government also discriminates against and creates difficulties for overseas Chinese working in factories and engaging in petty trade, depriving them of opportunities to earn a living and employment.
    On September 30, 1965, the Indian government illegally closed the overseas Chinese newspaper *China News* in Calcutta.
    Currently, India is experiencing a severe grain shortage. When supplying rationed grain, the Indian authorities deliberately discriminate against overseas Chinese and create difficulties in various ways.

    逮捕无辜华侨  劫夺华侨财产  勒令华侨离境
    印度政府继续迫害华侨无理之极
    新华社二十四日讯　印度政府继续迫害在印度的华侨。
    印度政府在一九六二年十月向中国发动大规模的武装进攻以后，把大批无辜华侨投入监狱和集中营。据最近从印度回到祖国的一些华侨揭露，现在在印度的德奥里集中营和加尔各答、孟买、诺冈等地监狱中，仍然被印度政府非法关押的无辜华侨还有几百人，他们在集中营和监狱中继续受到虐待。
    印度政府还继续把华侨的财产当作“敌产”而加以劫夺。印度《政治家报》一九六五年八月二十五日报道，“印度政府已决定由
  ‘敌产检查官’在春碑、大吉岭拍卖当地已由德奥里集中营回中国的华侨的财产。在春碑的该项财产约值十五万卢比”。在加尔各答附近塔坝地方开办皮革厂的华侨被印度当局逮捕后，皮革厂也被作为“敌产”接管。
    曾经受印度政府聘请在全印广播电台工作多年的华侨赵果夫妇，在冲破了印度政府的重重迫害回到祖国以后，要求印度政府付给他们在印工作期间应得的报酬一万九千多卢比。印度政府竟然说什么这笔款项的所有权现属“敌产管理人”，企图把它欠下的这笔债赖掉。
    从一九六四年初到现在，印度政府又勒令和平守法的华侨十五人限期离境。有些华侨海员随船出海工作之后，印度当局也不准他们回到印度同他们的亲人团聚。
    在加尔各答有许多华侨在船坞里工作，但自去年三月份开始，印度政府竟拒绝发给华侨进入船坞地区的通行证，迫使华侨不能继续在船坞工作。印度政府对于在工厂工作的华侨以及从事商业小贩，也多方排挤和刁难，剥夺他们谋生就业的机会。
    一九六五年九月三十日，印度政府非法封闭了在加尔各答的华侨报纸《中国新闻》。
    目前印度粮荒严重，印度当局在供应配售粮的时候，对华侨故意歧视，多方刁难。
