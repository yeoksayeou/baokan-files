    How We Cultivate Young Amateur Writers
    Beijing Military Region Political Department Cultural Department
    Through several years of practical work, we have come to realize that, in order for literature and art to better serve the three great revolutionary movements and the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, we must vigorously develop mass amateur creation and cultivate red literary and artistic fighters who can both labor and create, and who can use both guns and pens to fight. Our methods are "selection," "assistance," and "awards." We discover new talents through mass amateur creation, and in turn, promote mass amateur creation by cultivating literary and artistic backbones.
            "Selection"
    Choosing whom to cultivate as a target is a major issue involving the training and creation of successors to the proletarian literary cause. Therefore, we must select the "seedlings" well from the beginning and ensure that the roots are firmly planted. After learning some lessons, in recent years, we have consistently adhered to the two conditions of "focusing on virtue and valuing talent" when selecting "seedlings." To discover "seedlings" with both virtue and talent, we have adopted the following methods: (1) Continuously organize mass amateur creation activities in conjunction with the central tasks of the army; persist in annual, level-by-level amateur literary creation award evaluations, and discover talents through their works. (2) Rely on recommendations from cultural departments at all levels. (3) Use the old to lead the new, and cultivate general mass authors in a planned manner. Regardless of the method used to discover "seedlings," it is necessary to grasp the above conditions and select those who have good political ideology, a correct creative attitude, high enthusiasm for writing, a solid connection to the company (grassroots) life, and potential for development as "seedlings." Even if their creative level is temporarily low, we must make great efforts to support and cultivate them. Those who possess certain writing talents but lack good political ideology should not be listed as key targets for cultivation.
      Once the "seedlings" are selected, whether they can become "timber" still depends on long-term diligent cultivation.
            "Help"
    To cultivate young amateur authors, we must place helping them achieve ideological revolutionization in the most important position. This is a prerequisite for correctly implementing the Party's literary and artistic line and cultivating red literary and artistic fighters who wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this regard, we feel that the most fundamental link is to help authors study Chairman Mao's writings well, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and use Chairman Mao's thoughts, viewpoints, and methods as the criteria to treat everything and guide creative practice.
    To help authors study Chairman Mao's writings well, our approach is: 1. Arrange the study of Chairman Mao's writings as a task that authors must complete, and according to the actual ideological situation of the authors in each period, put forward clear requirements so that "learning" is implemented in "use." For example, in 1961 and 1962, in response to the authors' lack of deep understanding of the Party's literary and artistic line and some problems in their literary and artistic thinking, we stipulated the task of studying the book "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" well. In 1963, in response to the gradual deepening of the anti-revisionist struggle, it was proposed that on the basis of continuing to study "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" well, focus on studying five issues such as "war and peace, humanitarianism, writing heroes, writing reality" and so-called "artistic techniques." Last year and this year, according to the development of the class struggle situation, authors are required to focus on studying Chairman Mao's four philosophical works well. 2. Adhere to "four simultaneities." That is: at the same time as arranging creative tasks, arrange the task of studying Chairman Mao's writings; at the same time as checking and understanding work, check the authors' study of Chairman Mao's writings; at the same time as summarizing and exchanging experiences, summarize and exchange experiences in studying Chairman Mao's writings; at the same time as requiring authors to report on work, report on the study of Chairman Mao's writings. 3. Solve difficulties and provide convenience. For example, timely supply of learning materials; strive to allow authors to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study training camps at all levels; use opportunities such as holding forums and centralized discussions and revisions of works to organize Mao Zedong Thought study and invite leaders to give guidance reports.
    While firmly grasping the study of Chairman Mao's writings, we must do everything possible to help authors deeply immerse themselves in life and guide them to better integrate with the masses and learn from the advanced. This is not only a matter of enriching the source of creation, but also a very important aspect of directly promoting ideological revolutionization. Because, only with a strong ideology, correct viewpoints and methods, can one have new discoveries in life, have true insights, and be able to recognize the mainstream and distinguish right from wrong in the ever-changing ocean of life. Conversely, only by being involved in the fiery reality of struggle for a long time can the study of Chairman Mao's writings be linked to reality and can one's thinking be thoroughly transformed.
    Therefore, we have always paid attention to the following issues in this regard: First, insist on not allowing young amateur authors to be separated from the company (grassroots) and separated from "first-line" life. Authors at the grassroots level should be kept from being transferred to government offices as much as possible. Second, try to let them live deeply, and then appropriately broaden their scope on the basis of depth, enriching life from many aspects. For example, Comrade Wang Shixiang, due to his narrow life scope, not only had monotonous themes in his works, but also lacked in language. In order to enable him to obtain living materials from many aspects, the leadership once let him serve as a soldier, squad leader, and platoon leader in five or six different arms of service, such as infantry, communications, reconnaissance, and artillery. Third, induce them to improve their ability to understand life, observe life, and analyze life, induce them to learn from heroes and models, and require them to be mindful in life, consciously carry out self-transformation, and be thorough revolutionaries. Otherwise, even if they soak in the "source" for many years, it is impossible to make their thinking and life strong.
    When it is discovered that some authors are developing complacency and budding individualism, they should also be reminded in time to do political and ideological work in advance. In short, "warning bells" should be rung in time, and "preventive injections" should be given appropriately, in order to prevent problems before they occur and enhance immunity to the invasion and influence of bourgeois ideology.
    In addition, in the process of helping young amateur authors achieve ideological revolutionization, we must make great efforts to help them improve their creative skills and artistic expression abilities. If a literary and artistic author lacks basic skills in this area, they cannot express correct thoughts and rich life through perfect works of art. In order to improve their creative ability, we have used a variety of methods, such as inviting professional authors to pass on their experience and analyzing and studying excellent works, etc.... However, the most practical and effective method is to continuously organize them to create and improve in artistic practice. Only by frequently "repeatedly looking, repeatedly thinking, repeatedly writing, and repeatedly revising," and after a long period of honing and paying diligent labor, can skills become strong.
            "Award"
    Awards can establish learning "models" for young amateur authors and the vast number of active amateur literary and artistic creators, so that they can identify the direction of creation from specific works; they can encourage creation and better mobilize the author's creative enthusiasm; and they can help authors summarize their experiences and move forward better. Since 1959, we have adhered to an annual amateur literary and artistic creation award system, and have paid attention to the following issues in our work:
    1. Adhere to putting politics in command. The awarded works must conform to the Party's literary and artistic line and serve the promotion of proletarian ideology and the elimination of bourgeois ideology, and the consolidation and improvement of the combat effectiveness of the troops. Judging from the works we have awarded in recent years, although some works are still rough in art, the political direction is correct.
    2. High standards and strict requirements. "High" of course, cannot be too high to reach, it must rise with the tide, and the rewarded works must always be able to play a "model" role for the majority of amateur authors. "Strict" is mainly strict with the authors in the creation process. Only in this way can we guide the authors to repeatedly deliberate and repeatedly revise. Through the continuous improvement of the "model", to drive the improvement of the creative level of the masses.
    3. Mass line. The rewarded works must have a solid mass base, and works that have not been tested by the masses are generally not awarded. Otherwise, the masses will not recognize it, and it will lose its "model" role. In order to widely listen to the opinions of the masses and absorb more amateur authors to participate in this work, so that they have an opportunity to learn, summarize, and improve, we have adopted the method of unified requirements, level-by-level evaluation by business departments, and level-by-level approval by political organs.
    4. Create momentum. To implement the Party's line, implement the instructions of higher authorities, or advocate something in creation? What to oppose? It is impossible without a mass momentum. Literary and artistic awards are a great opportunity to create such momentum. Therefore, each time we give awards, we use a series of methods such as issuing circulars, publishing newspapers, writing comments, and holding award meetings to create a certain momentum in the troops. In our amateur creation, several climaxes such as writing realistic themes and writing heroic characters were formed under the influence of this momentum.
    5. Do not engage in material incentives. Awards are first and foremost political awards. Secondly, give honorary awards, with political organs issuing certificates or awarding political and literary study books, etc. Absolutely do not engage in material incentives, otherwise, not only will the true purpose of the award not be achieved, but it will also lead young authors astray.

    我们是怎样培养青年业余作者的
    北京部队政治部文化部
    经过几年的工作实践，我们体会到，文艺要更好地为三大革命运动服务，为兴无灭资的斗争服务，必须大力发展群众的业余创作，培养既会劳动又能创作，既能使枪杆子又会用笔杆子进行战斗的红色文艺战士。我们采用的办法是“选”、“帮”、“奖”。通过群众业余创作来发现新苗，反过来，又通过培养文艺骨干来推动群众业余创作。
            “选”
    选什么人作为培养对象，是一个涉及到培养、造就无产阶级文学事业接班人的大问题。因此，一开始就要把“苗子”选好，使根子扎正。我们接受了一些教训以后，近几年来在选“苗子”时，一直坚持了“着眼于德，器重于才”这两个方面的条件。为了发现德、才兼备的“苗子”，我们采用了如下办法：（1）不断地结合部队中心任务，组织群众性的业余创作活动；坚持一年一度逐级进行的业余文艺创作评奖，通过作品发现人才。（2）依靠各级文化业务部门的推荐。（3）以老带新，有计划地在一般群众作者中培养。无论通过何种办法发现“苗子”，必须在掌握上述条件的同时，把那些政治思想好，创作态度正确，写作热情高，连队（基层）生活厚实而又有发展前途的人作为“苗子”。尽管他们创作水平暂时还低，也要下大功夫扶持他、培养他。对于那些虽然具有一定的写作才能，但政治思想不好的人，不能列为重点培养对象。
      “苗子”选好了，能否成“材”，还得靠长期的辛勤培育。
            “帮”
    培养青年业余作者，必须把帮助他们实现思想革命化放在头等重要的位置上，这是正确贯彻党的文艺方针，培养全心全意为工农兵服务的红色文艺战士的前提条件。在这方面，我们觉得最根本的环节是帮助作者学好毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，以毛主席的思想、观点、方法为准则，对待一切事物，指导创作实践。
    为帮助作者学好毛主席著作，我们的作法是：一、把学习毛主席著作作为作者必须完成的任务来安排，并根据每一时期作者的思想实际，提出明确要求，使“学”落实于“用”。如一九六一、一九六二年，我们针对作者对党的文艺方针缺乏深刻理解和在文艺思想上存在的一些问题，规定了学好《毛泽东论文艺》一本书的任务。一九六三年又针对反修斗争的逐步深入，提出了在继续学好《毛泽东论文艺》的基础上，着重研究“战争与和平、人道主义、写英雄、写真实”及所谓“艺术技巧”等五个问题。去年和今年，根据阶级斗争形势的发展，要求作者重点学好毛主席的四篇哲学著作。二、坚持“四同时”。即：布置创作任务的同时布置学习毛主席著作任务；检查、了解工作的同时检查作者学习毛主席著作情况；总结、交流经验的同时总结交流学习毛主席著作经验；要求作者汇报工作的同时汇报学习毛主席著作情况。三、解决困难，给予方便。比如及时供应学习材料；争取让作者参加各级开办的毛主席著作学习集训；利用召开座谈会和集中讨论、修改作品的机会，组织毛主席著作学习，请首长作辅导报告等。
    在狠抓学习毛主席著作过硬的同时，要千方百计地帮助作者深入好生活，指导他们在生活中更好地与群众相结合，向先进学习，这不仅是丰富创作源泉的问题，也是直接促使思想革命化非常重要的一个方面。因为，只有思想过硬，观点、方法对头了，才能在生活中有新的发现，才能有真知灼见，才能从千变万化的生活海洋中认清主流，明辨是非。反过来说，也只有长期投身于火热的现实斗争生活，才能使毛主席著作学习做到理论联系实际，才能使思想得到彻底改造。
    因而，我们在这方面一直注意了这样几个问题：第一、坚持不让青年业余作者脱离连队（基层）、脱离“第一线”生活，在基层的作者尽量不往机关里调。第二、尽量使他们生活得深一些，然后，在深的基础上适当广一些，从多方面丰富生活。如王石祥同志，由于生活面狭窄，因而作品不仅题材单调，语言也嫌不足。为了使他从多方面获得生活原料，领导上曾让他担任步兵、通讯兵、侦察兵、炮兵等五、六种不同兵种的战士、班长、排长职务。第三、诱导他们提高认识生活、观察生活、分析生活的能力，诱导他们向英雄模范学习，要求他们在生活中作有心人，自觉地进行自我改造，作彻底的革命派。否则，就是长年泡在“源泉”里，也不可能使思想、生活过得硬。
    当发现有的作者滋长自满情绪和个人主义思想萌芽的时候，也要及时向他们提醒，把政治思想工作做在前头。总之，“警钟”要及时敲，“防疫针”要适时打，才能防微杜渐，才能增强对资产阶级思想侵袭和影响的免疫力。
    另外，在帮助青年业余作者实现思想革命化的过程中，一定要下大力帮助他们提高创作技巧和艺术表现能力。一个文艺作者如缺乏这方面的基本功，就不能把正确的思想，丰富的生活通过完美的艺术作品表现出来。为提高他们的创作能力，我们曾经采用过多种方法，如请专业作者传经，对优秀作品进行分析研究等等……。但是，最切实可行、行之有效的方法是不断地组织他们进行创作，在艺术实践中提高，只有经常“反复地看，反复地想，反复地写，反复地改”，经过长时间磨砺，付出辛勤劳动，才能使技巧过得硬。
            “奖”
    奖励，可为青年业余作者和广大业余文艺创作积极分子树立学习的“样板”，使他们从具体作品中，辨明创作方向；可以鼓励创作，更好地调动作者的创作积极性；可以帮助作者总结经验，更好地前进。自一九五九年以来，我们一直坚持了一年一次的业余文艺创作评奖制度，并在工作中注意了以下几个问题：
    一、坚持政治挂帅。所奖的作品，一定要符合党的文艺方针，和为兴无灭资、巩固与提高部队战斗力服务。从我们几年奖励的作品来看，虽然有些作品在艺术上还嫌粗糙，但政治方向是正确的。
    二、高标准、严要求。“高”，当然也不能高不可攀，要水涨船高，奖励的作品总要能对多数业余作者起到“样板”作用才行。“严”，主要是在创作过程中对作者严，只有这样才能引导作者反复推敲，反复修改。通过“样板”的不断提高，来带动群众创作水平的提高。
    三、群众路线。奖励的作品一定要有雄厚的群众基础，未经群众考验的作品一般不奖。否则群众不认账，也就失去了“样板”的作用。为了广泛听取群众意见，吸收更多的业余作者参与这项工作，使他们有一个学习、总结、提高的机会，我们采取了统一要求，逐级业务部门评选，逐级政治机关审批的方法。
    四、造声势。在广大业余作者中贯彻党的方针、执行上级指示，或在创作上提倡什么？反对什么？没有一个群众性的声势是不行的。文艺评奖就是造这样声势的大好时机。因而，我们每次评奖都要通过发通报、登报纸、写评论、开授奖会等一系列方法，在部队造成一定的声势。我们业余创作中，大写现实题材、大写英雄人物等几个高潮，就是在这一声势的影响下形成的。
    五、不搞物质刺激。奖，首先是从政治上奖。其次是给予荣誉奖，由政治机关颁发奖状或奖给政治、文艺学习书籍等。绝不能搞物质刺激，否则，不仅达不到奖励的真正目的，而且还会把青年作者引入歧途。
