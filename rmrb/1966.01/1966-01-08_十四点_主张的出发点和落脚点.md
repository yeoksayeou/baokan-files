    The Starting Point and End Result of the "Fourteen Points" Proposal
    By Our Staff Commentator
    The Johnson government is peddling a so-called "basket of peace" containing "Fourteen Points" everywhere. Its leading figures have repeatedly stated that the United States now has a thousand, even ten thousand, "sincere intentions" to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue.
    The "sincerity" of the Johnson government is not difficult to judge. Just by looking at how it describes the origin of the Vietnam issue and how it explains the United States' position in South Vietnam, it is not hard to know what kind of stuff the "Fourteen Points" proposal is.
    The White House added two unmissable preambles to the official text of the "Fourteen Points" it published on January 3. One is the so-called "facts of aggression," and the other is the so-called "obligations undertaken by the United States."
    What are the "facts of aggression"? The White House document states: "The simple and clear fact is that Hanoi sent thousands upon thousands of trained armed personnel" "into South Vietnam," "and it is this external aggression that is responsible for the deployment of U.S. combat troops." Listen to this: Vietnamese people "invaded" Vietnam, and Vietnamese people are responsible for the American invasion; while Americans who travel across the ocean to Vietnam are not invaders, but "heroes" who stop aggression. This absurd logic is the premise of the "Fourteen Points" proposal and the starting point for the Johnson government's resolution of the Vietnam issue.
    Who is the aggressor and who is the victim of aggression is a major issue of right and wrong that cannot be confused. The United States is the aggressor and the culprit for tearing up the Geneva Accords. The facts are all there and cannot be denied. The Johnson government must bow its head and admit that the United States is the aggressor, and immediately stop the aggression against Vietnam and withdraw its troops from South Vietnam immediately. Only by doing so can it prove that the United States is truly sincere in peacefully resolving the Vietnam issue. The Johnson government is reversing right and wrong in this way, yet still talking about "peacefully resolving" the Vietnam issue, which can only show that its "Fourteen Points" are completely deceptive.
    People can't help but ask, since the United States does not admit that it is the aggressor, but says that it wants to resolve the Vietnam issue on the "basis" of the Geneva Accords, what is its intention? The Johnson government means that it was right for Americans to come to Vietnam and that they have the right to continue to stay in South Vietnam to stop "external aggression"; it is possible for Americans to leave, but only after "external aggression is eliminated," that is, after the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and stop resisting. This is the "basis" of the Geneva Accords that the Johnson government wants to implement. If this is done, South Vietnam will be completely reduced to an American colony and military base, and the achievements of the South Vietnamese people's struggle over the past eleven years will be wiped out.
    What are the "obligations undertaken by the United States"? The White House document states: The United States' obligations are "bilateral agreements with South Vietnam," "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Treaty," and "solemn declarations by three American presidents." According to these "obligations," the United States has the right to "resist external attacks" and "maintain the security of South Vietnam." It is already absurd enough for the United States to sign any agreements with the puppets in its pocket, and it is even more absurd for the United States to announce through the military bloc it controls that a certain region is "protected" by it. What is even more absurd is that the U.S. president can unilaterally declare that he has assumed "obligations" somewhere and use this as a basis for armed aggression. American imperialism is truly overbearing to the extreme!
    On the Vietnam issue, the United States has indeed undertaken obligations. This is the obligation stipulated in the 1954 Geneva Accords to respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam. Apart from this, all the "obligations" undertaken by the United States are all excuses it has created for carrying out aggression. The United States must revoke these unilateral so-called "obligations" and immediately withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to solve their own affairs. This is the practical action of the United States' willingness to fulfill the Geneva Accords. Now, the Johnson government keeps its mouth shut about the obligations of the Geneva Accords, but brazenly talks about its "obligations" to occupy South Vietnam, which can only prove that the United States has no sincerity in resolving the Vietnam issue at all, but wants to legitimize the behavior of the U.S. military to remain in South Vietnam.
    It is very clear that the starting point of the Johnson government's "Fourteen Points" proposal is that the Vietnamese people are carrying out "aggression" and American imperialism is stopping "aggression." So, where is the end result of the "Fourteen Points" proposal? The conclusion of the White House document is: "Apart from surrendering South Vietnam, we have put everything into the basket of peace."
    How frankly put! South Vietnam is American's, and everything else can be "negotiated" and "discussed," except the fact that the United States is赖在南越 and will not leave. This absurd logic is absolutely unacceptable to any country and people who uphold justice and cherish their sovereignty.
    The Johnson government's "basket of peace" contains such extremely dirty and extremely vicious goods. Saying that the Vietnamese people are "aggressors" is a great insult to the Vietnamese people. Saying that the American aggression is a reasonable and legal "obligation" is a brutal trampling on Vietnamese independence and sovereignty. Declaring that the United States'赖在南越 is unchangeable is a mad challenge to the Vietnamese people. As the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out in his statement on January 4, "No matter how hard the American authorities try to cover up their aggressive ambitions with sophistry, they cannot deceive anyone." The statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on January 5 also pointed out that "the more the US authorities talk about 'peace', the more aggressor troops and murderous weapons they send to South Vietnam, and at the same time the more they step up the improvement of the US aggressive war machine in South Vietnam." The thirty-one million Vietnamese people cannot be intimidated or deceived. The American's "Fourteen Points" proposal is bound to fail. The American's great peace talks swindle and great conspiracy are bound to go bankrupt completely.

    “十四点”主张的出发点和落脚点
    本报评论员
    约翰逊政府提着一个所谓“和平的篮子”，里面装着“十四点”，到处叫卖。它的头面人物一再表白：美国现在具有和平解决越南问题的一千个、一万个“诚意”。
    约翰逊政府的“诚意”并不难于判断。只要看它是怎样叙述越南问题的起因的，怎样说明美国在南越的地位的，就不难知道“十四点”主张是种什么货色。
    白宫在它一月三日公布的“十四点”正式文本中，加了两段不可不读的序言。一是所谓“侵略的事实”，一是所谓“美国承担的义务”。
    什么是“侵略的事实”呢？白宫的文件说：“简单明了的事实是，河内把成千成万受过训练的武装人员”“派进南越”，“就是这种外来的侵略应对美国派驻战斗部队负责”。请听：越南人“侵略”了越南，越南人应对美国侵略负责；而远渡重洋来到越南的美国人，倒不是侵略者，而是制止侵略的“英雄”。这种荒谬绝伦的逻辑，是“十四点”主张的前提，是约翰逊政府解决越南问题的出发点。
    谁是侵略者，谁是被侵略者，这是一个不容混淆的大是大非问题。美国是侵略者，是撕毁日内瓦协议的罪魁祸首，事实俱在，不容抵赖。约翰逊政府必须低头认罪，承认美国是侵略者，并且立即停止对越南的侵略，立即从南越撤军。这样做了，才能证明美国真的有和平解决越南问题的诚意。约翰逊政府这样颠倒是非，却还在大谈特谈“和平解决”越南问题，这只能说明它的“十四点”完全是骗人的东西。
    人们难免要问，美国既然不承认自己是侵略者，又说要在日内瓦协议的“基础”上解决越南问题，是什么用意呢？约翰逊政府的意思是说，美国人来到越南是对的，有权继续留在南越制止“外来的侵略”；要美国人走是可以的，只是在“外来的侵略消除”之后，也就是说，在越南人民放下武器、停止抵抗之后。约翰逊政府所要执行的日内瓦协议的“基础”，就是如此。如果照此办理，南越就完全沦为美国的殖民地和军事基地，南越人民十一年来的斗争成果就将化为乌有。
    什么是“美国承担的义务”呢？白宫的文件说：美国的义务就是“同南越的双边协议”，就是“东南亚条约组织条约”，就是“三位美国总统的庄严的宣布”。根据这些“义务”，美国有权“抵御外来的攻击”、“维护南越的安全”。美国同它口袋里的傀儡签订什么协议，美国可以通过它所控制的军事集团宣布某一地区由它“保护”，这本来是十分荒唐的。更加荒唐的是，美国总统可以单方面宣布在哪里承担了“义务”，并据此进行武装侵略。美帝国主义真是霸道到了极点！
    在越南问题上，美国确实是承担了义务的。这就是一九五四年日内瓦协议所规定的尊重越南独立、主权、统一和领土完整的义务。除此之外，美国承担的一切“义务”，通通是它为进行侵略制造的借口。美国必须撤销这些单方面的所谓“义务”，立即从南越撤军，让越南人民自己解决自己的事务，才是美国愿意履行日内瓦协议的实际行动。现在，约翰逊政府闭口不谈日内瓦协议的义务，却厚着脸皮大谈其霸占南越的“义务”，只能证明美国根本没有解决越南问题的诚意，而是想把美军赖在南越的行为合法化。
    这就很清楚，约翰逊政府“十四点”主张的出发点，是越南人民进行“侵略”、美帝国主义制止“侵略”。那么，“十四点”主张的落脚点在哪里呢？白宫文件的结语是：“除了拱让南越之外，我们已经把所有的东西都放进了和平的篮子”。
    说得好坦率！南越是美国人的，除了美国赖在南越不走这一点之外，其他都是可以“谈判”、可以“讨论”的。这种荒谬绝伦的逻辑，是任何主持正义、珍视自己主权的国家和人民所绝对不能同意的。
    约翰逊政府“和平的篮子”里，放的是这种极其肮脏和极其恶毒的货色。把越南人民说成是“侵略者”，这是对越南人民莫大的侮辱。把美国的侵略说成是合理合法的“义务”，这是对越南独立主权的粗暴蹂躏。把美国赖在南越宣布为不能改变的，这是对越南人民的疯狂挑战。正如越南民主共和国外交部发言人一月四日的声明所指出的，“不管美国当局怎样竭力用诡辩的语言来掩盖其侵略野心，都是骗不了任何人的”。越南南方民族解放阵线一月五日的声明也指出：“美国当局谈‘和平’谈得最多的时候，也就是它们向越南南方运进侵略军和杀人武器最多的时候，同时也是在越南南方加紧健全美国侵略战争机构的时候。”三千一百万越南人民是吓不倒、骗不了的。美国的“十四点”主张是一定不能得逞的。美国的和谈大骗局、大阴谋是一定要彻底破产的。
