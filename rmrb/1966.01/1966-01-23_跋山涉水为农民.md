　　After coming down [to the countryside], we began a tense series of performances, successively performing in the communes of Xiekou, Xiquan, Hanyu, Xingzhe, and Renzong. Often, we changed locations every day, including walking, setting up the stage, performing, dismantling the stage, and walking. Sometimes we performed two shows a day, walking between twenty and fifty li each day. For example, on the day we performed in Hanyu, we went up the mountain early in the morning to set up the stage. To accommodate the villagers in the mountainous area, we performed one show during the day and another in the evening. After the performance, we went down the mountain, and it was already past one o'clock when we returned to Liushu Village.

　　The most arduous trip was to Renzong for a performance. We selected twenty-seven people and set off from the county town at seven o'clock in the morning, carrying our costumes and makeup supplies, with props carried by donkeys. We climbed Mount Li, passing the beacon tower, all the way along dangerous paths, straight into the deep mountains. After walking for more than four hours, we arrived at our destination and immediately set up the stage. We ate a simple meal and then performed. This place was extremely remote, and the villagers hadn't seen a play in two or three years. The villagers in the mountainous area lived scattered, with only a few families in each village. The entire commune was scattered across a mountainous area fifty li long and twenty-five li wide. The villagers came from afar to watch the show, and the scene was exceptionally enthusiastic. The audience moved the performers, and we even added extra programs during the performance. When the performance ended, it was already four o'clock. We didn't have time to eat dinner; each person chewed on half a steamed bun and then we headed back. The villagers stood on the mountain tops, waving frequently as we hurried down the mountain. It got dark halfway down. That day was overcast, and the mountain stones were slippery. Comrades wearing plastic-soled shoes would slip and fall if they weren't careful. What was particularly dangerous was that the mountain roads were rugged, and many places were on the edge of cliffs; taking half a step more would have been unthinkable. Fortunately, we had prepared early and brought flashlights when we set off in the morning. We called out to each other along the way. Those who walked faster went down the mountain, while those who walked slower were still on the mountain top, with a difference of nearly an hour's journey between them. That day, the people who stayed behind watched Mount Li in the county town after dinner. When they saw the dots of flashlight beams coming down the mountain, they were extremely excited. In the deep of the night, the only sound was the mutual shouts coming from Mount Li. They immediately wrote a welcome speech, ran into the streets, and waited at the main road to welcome the returning comrades. Xiao Jiang, Lao Xu, Xiao Shi, Lao Lü, and Xiao Han were the vanguard of the entire team, the first to come down. The welcomers and the welcomed met in the street. The welcome speech was: "A string of flashlight lights on the mountain, the lights twinkling like a dragon, gazing at our comrades coming down the mountain, unlimited scenery at the dangerous peaks. The mountain is high, the road is heavy, the light cavalry comes down from the mountain. Great enthusiasm, red thoughts, wholeheartedly serving the masses. Iron feet, tough and reliable, sending culture into the deep mountains. Twenty-seven fiery hearts, triumphantly returning to the county town, our rear guard team, comes to welcome you, welcome hardworking good brothers. The theater has boiled white water, washing away the dust of the journey to Renzong. Share more combat experience, we also want to borrow the east wind." From this, one can see a glimpse of the scene that day. Everyone said that this march had tempered them, and those who did not go, although they obeyed orders, inevitably had some "emotions."

　　After finishing the performances in the communes of Huaqing, we came to the communes of Xinfeng for performances. On the plains of Weinan, the winter nights were cold and windy. Performing outdoors, wearing thin clothes, we naturally felt cold. We performed at the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, surrounded by open space, with no place to block the wind. That day, a cold wave arrived, and we felt cold all over, but our hearts were fiery, and the audience's emotions were fiery.

    跋山涉水为农民
    下来以后，我们便开始了紧张的演出活动。先后在斜口、西泉、韩峪、行者、仁宗等公社演出。经常是每天换一个地方，包括走路、装台、演出、拆台、走路。有时一天演出两场，每天走的路在二十到五十里之间。例如在韩峪演出的那天，就是清早上山装台，为了照顾山区老乡，白天演了一场，晚上再演出，演完后下山，回到柳树村时已是下一点多了。
    最艰苦的一次是到仁宗演出，我们选了二十七人，清晨七时从县城出发，背上自己的服装和化妆用品，道具用毛驴驮着，爬上骊山，经过烽火台，一路险道，直往深山里去。走了四个多小时，到了目的地，马上装台，简单地吃了点东西就演出。这里极为偏僻，老乡们已经两三年没看到戏了。山区老乡居住分散，一个村只几户人家，整个公社分散在五十里长、二十五里宽的山区里。老乡远道赶来看戏，那情景异常热烈。观众感动了演员，演出中还加了节目。演出完了，已经四点，来不及吃饭，每人啃了半个馍，就往回走。老乡们站在山头频频招手，我们匆忙下山。半路上，天就黑了。那天是阴天，加上山石又滑，穿塑料底鞋的同志一不小心就摔跤。特别危险的是，山路崎岖，一路许多地方濒临悬岩，多迈半步，就会不堪设想。幸好都早有准备，清晨出发时就带了手电。一路之上互相吆喝招呼。走得快的下了山，走得慢的还在山顶，前后相差近一小时的路程。那天留守的人，吃过晚饭就在县城里注目骊山，当见到点点手电光从山上下来时，真是兴奋异常，夜深人静，只听得骊山上传来相互吆喝声。当即写了欢迎词，跑上街头，在大路口迎接归来的同志。小姜、老许、小史、老吕、小韩，是整个队伍的先头部队，最先下来。欢迎的人与被欢迎的人街头相见。那欢迎词是：“山上一串手电灯，灯光闪闪象条龙，遥望战友下山来，无限风光在险峰。山高高，路重重，山上下来了轻骑兵。干劲大，思想红，全心全意为群众。铁脚板，过得硬，把文化送到深山中。二十七颗火热的心，凯旋归来进县城，我们留守队，来欢迎，欢迎勤劳的好弟兄。剧场烧好了白开水，洗掉征尘表仁宗。战斗经验多介绍，我们也要借东风。”从这里，可见当日情景之一斑。大家都说，这次行军锻炼了自己，没去的人虽服从了命令，也难免闹了点“情绪”。
    结束了在华清各公社的演出后，我们又来到新丰各公社演出。渭南平原的冬夜，寒风瑟瑟。露天演出，穿着单薄的衣裳，当然会觉得冷。我们在秦始皇陵演出，四周空旷，一点挡风的地方也没有。这天寒流到来，浑身上下到处都是凉的，但心是火热的，观众的情绪是火热的。
