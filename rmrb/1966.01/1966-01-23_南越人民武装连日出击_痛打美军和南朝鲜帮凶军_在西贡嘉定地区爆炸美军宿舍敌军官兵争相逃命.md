    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 22nd dispatch: The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces have launched continuous attacks in areas such as Tuy Hoa and Da Nang in recent days, severely punishing the U.S. aggressor troops and South Korean accomplice troops.
    According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Army of Phu Yen Province in South Vietnam ambushed patrols of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division three times near Tuy Hoa on the evening of the 20th, the morning of the 21st, and the afternoon, inflicting casualties on the U.S. troops. Under the continuous attacks of the Liberation Army, the U.S. patrols hurriedly escaped by helicopter on the afternoon of the 21st.
    On the night of the 21st, the Liberation Army near Da Nang also attacked patrols of the U.S. Marine Corps three times. On the 21st, anti-American leaflets distributed by the people's armed forces also appeared in the urban area of Da Nang. On the same night, the Liberation Army of Phu Yen Province severely punished South Korean accomplice troops southwest of Tuy Hoa. The Liberation Army first rushed to a place less than fifty feet from the enemy stronghold, opened fire with mortars and small arms, and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the South Korean accomplice troops for more than two hours, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The news said that because "the fighting was so close, the American jets called in for support dared not open fire."
    On the morning of the 22nd, the People's Armed Forces exploded a bomb outside the wall of a U.S. military dormitory in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area, blowing a large hole in the wall. Preliminary reports say that three U.S. soldiers inside were known to have been killed or wounded, "but it is impossible to immediately determine the exact number." When the explosion occurred, U.S. military officers and soldiers living in the dormitory scrambled to escape, some not even bothering to put on clothes, and fled in disarray into nearby fortifications in only their shorts.

    南越人民武装连日出击
    痛打美军和南朝鲜帮凶军
    在西贡嘉定地区爆炸美军宿舍敌军官兵争相逃命
    新华社二十二日讯  西贡消息：越南南方人民武装连日来在绥和、岘港等地区连续痛击美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军。
    据西方通讯社报道，越南南方富安省的解放军在二十日傍晚、二十一日清晨和下午，在绥和附近接连三次袭击美军第一零一空降师的巡逻队，使美军遭到伤亡。在解放军的接连袭击下，美军巡逻队在二十一日下午慌忙乘直升飞机逃走。
    二十一日晚，岘港附近的解放军也三次袭击了美国海军陆战队的巡逻队。二十一日，在岘港市区还出现了人民武装散发的反美传单。同一天晚上，富安省解放军又在绥和西南痛击南朝鲜帮凶军。解放军首先冲到离敌军据点不到五十英尺的地方，用迫击炮和小型武器开火，然后同南朝鲜帮凶军进行了两个多小时的肉搏战，使敌军遭到严重伤亡。消息说，由于“战斗挨得那么近，以致调来支援的美国喷气式飞机不敢开火”。
    人民武装二十二日清晨在西贡嘉定区一所美军宿舍墙外爆炸了一颗炸弹，把墙炸开了一个大洞。初步消息说，已知里边的美军被炸死炸伤三名，“可是无法立即断定确切的人数”。在爆炸发生时，住在这所宿舍里的美军军官和士兵争相逃命，有的连衣服也顾不上穿，只穿一条短裤狼狈逃进附近的工事里。（附图片）
