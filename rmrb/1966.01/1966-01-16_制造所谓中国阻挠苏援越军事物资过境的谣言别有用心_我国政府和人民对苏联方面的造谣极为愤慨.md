    In our memorandum to the Soviet government, it was pointed out that the Chinese government has consistently provided all possible convenience and assistance for the transit of weapons needed by Vietnam and which the Soviet side is willing to provide. The repeated dissemination of rumors by the Soviet side is aimed at provoking relations between China and Vietnam and serving U.S. imperialism. The Soviet government's unreasonable refusal to accept our memorandum and its refusal to publicly clarify the rumors represent another step in worsening state relations between China and the Soviet Union.
      Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: This reporter learned from relevant sources that on January 4, 1966, Wang Bingnan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, met with Soviet Ambassador to China, Lapin, and handed over a memorandum from the Chinese government to the Soviet government regarding the Soviet side's repeated fabrication of rumors that China was obstructing the transit of Soviet military supplies to Vietnam.
      The Chinese government's memorandum pointed out that the Chinese government has consistently met the Soviet government's reasonable requests and provided all possible convenience and assistance for the transit of weapons needed by Vietnam and which the Soviet side is willing to provide. However, the Soviet side has intentionally fabricated various rumors, slandering China for obstructing the transit of Soviet military supplies to Vietnam, even saying that China demanded that the Soviet Union pay transit fees in U.S. dollars. Despite repeated warnings from the Chinese side, the Soviet side has intensified its rumor-mongering. Now, these rumors are not only widely spread privately but also openly published in Soviet newspapers and periodicals. This cannot but make the Chinese government and the Chinese people feel extremely indignant. The Chinese government solemnly demands that the Soviet government be responsible for publicly clarifying these rumors, guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and respond as soon as possible (this reporter notes: the Soviet periodical "Abroad" published an article in its 50th issue of 1965, reprinting an article from the "New York Times," which slandered China for demanding that the Soviet Union pay transit fees for aid materials to Vietnam in U.S. dollars).
    Chinese sources pointed out that from February 25, 1965, when the Soviet side first submitted an application to China, until today, the Chinese government has satisfied all requests from the Soviet government, confirmed by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, concerning the transit of military supplies and technical personnel aiding Vietnam. Chinese railways use special express military transportation methods to transport these supplies and personnel. Each time the Soviet side transports supplies and personnel to the Chinese border station, the Chinese side immediately prepares trains to receive them; the time from the Sino-Soviet border to the Sino-Vietnamese border generally does not exceed ten days. Chinese railways transport these military supplies and personnel free of charge, not only without charging the Soviet side a single U.S. dollar, but also without asking for a single kopeck. In this regard, relevant Soviet personnel have repeatedly expressed satisfaction. For example, on October 21, 1965, Colonel Saidan, acting representative of the Soviet Foreign Economic Liaison Committee in China, who was responsible for this transportation work, said: "We give a positive evaluation of the efforts made by the relevant Chinese parties in assisting the transshipment of Soviet military supplies to Vietnam." Recently, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong also mentioned that "aid materials from the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries have been delivered to Vietnam according to plan."
    The facts are so clear, and the Soviet side knows these situations so clearly. However, rumors that China is obstructing the transit of Soviet military supplies to Vietnam continue to spread from the Soviet side. In this situation, it is entirely reasonable for the Chinese government to demand that the Soviet government be responsible for publicly clarifying these rumors and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.
    It is surprising that although the Soviet weekly has already printed such rumors in black and white, Ambassador Lapin flatly denied it during his conversation with Vice Minister Wang Bingnan, even claiming that the Soviet weekly "Abroad" "mistakenly published" a report from the American "New York Times," and that the Soviet government cannot be responsible for the reports of Soviet newspapers. Ambassador Lapin not only rejected the Chinese government's reasonable request for the Soviet government to publicly clarify and guarantee that it would no longer fabricate such rumors, but also unreasonably refused to accept the Chinese government's memorandum. On January 9, 1966, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent someone to the Soviet Embassy in China to deliver the Chinese government's memorandum; the next day, the Soviet Embassy in China returned the Chinese government's memorandum to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On January 11, 1966, the Chinese government again sent someone to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its embassy in the Soviet Union to deliver this memorandum; on the same day, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs also returned this memorandum to the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union. This practice of the Soviet side cannot but be regarded as another step in worsening state relations between China and the Soviet Union.
    Chinese sources pointed out that the Soviet side's dissemination of rumors that China is obstructing the transit of Soviet military supplies to Vietnam is self-defeating. The reason why it continues to do so endlessly is obviously with ulterior motives. To put it bluntly, it is to slander China, provoke relations between China and Vietnam, and serve U.S. imperialism. No matter how stubbornly the Soviet government refuses to accept the Chinese government's memorandum and refuses to publicly clarify these rumors, the result can only be to cover up the truth.

    制造所谓中国阻挠苏援越军事物资过境的谣言别有用心
    我国政府和人民对苏联方面的造谣极为愤慨
    在我致苏联政府的备忘录中指出：中国政府对于越南方面需要的、苏联方面愿意提供的武器过境，一贯提供了一切可能的便利和协助。苏联方面一再散布谣言，是为的挑拨中越关系，为美帝效劳。苏联政府无理拒绝接受我备忘录，拒绝公开澄清谣言，在恶化中苏两国的国家关系的道路上又迈出了新的一步。
      新华社十五日讯　本社记者从有关方面获悉，中国外交部副部长王炳南于一九六六年一月四日接见了苏联驻华大使拉宾，面交中国政府就苏联方面一再制造中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资过境的谣言问题致苏联政府的一份备忘录。
      中国政府的备忘录指出，中国政府对于越南方面需要的、苏联方面愿意提供的武器过境，一贯满足苏联政府的合理要求，提供一切可能的便利和协助。但是，苏联方面却有意制造种种谣言，诬蔑中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资过境，甚至说中国要苏联用美元支付过境费用。尽管中国方面一再提出忠告，苏联方面的这种造谣生事却变本加厉。现在，这种谣言不仅在私下广为散布，而且公开刊登在苏联报刊上。这不能不使中国政府和中国人民感到极大的愤慨。中国政府严正要求苏联政府负责公开澄清这些谣言，保证今后不再发生类似事件，并且尽早给予回答（本社记者按：苏联《在国外》周刊一九六五年第五十期曾用转载《纽约时报》文章的方式，诬蔑中国要苏联以美元支付援越物资过境的费用）。
    中国有关方面指出，从一九六五年二月二十五日苏联方面第一次向中国提出申请起，直到今天，凡是苏联政府提出并经越南民主共和国政府确认的有关援越军事物资和技术人员过境的要求，中国政府都给予了满足。中国铁路运送这些物资和人员，全部采用特快的军运办法。每次苏联方面把物资和人员运到中国边境站，中国方面都立即备车接运；从中苏边境运到中越边境，时间一般不超过十天。中国铁路运送这些军事物资和人员，都是无偿的，不但没有向苏联方面收取过一分美金，而且没有要过一个戈比。对此，苏联有关人员曾一再表示满意。例如，一九六五年十月二十一日，负责这项运输工作的苏联对外经济联络委员会驻华代理代表赛旦上校说：“对中国有关方面在协助转运苏联援越军事物资方面所作的努力，我们给予肯定的评价。”最近，范文同总理也提到，“苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助物资，已经按计划运交给越南。”
    事实是这样的明明白白，苏联方面对这些情况是知道的这样清清楚楚。但是，所谓中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资过境的谣言还是不断地从苏联方面传播出来。在这种情况下，中国政府要求苏联政府负责公开澄清这些谣言，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件，这完全是合情合理的。
    令人惊异的是，明明苏联的周刊已经黑字印在白纸上登载了这类谣言，拉宾大使在同王炳南副部长谈话时却一口否认，竟称苏联《在国外》周刊是“误登了”美国《纽约时报》的报道，苏联政府不能对苏联报刊的报道负责。拉宾大使不仅拒绝中国政府提出的由苏联政府公开澄清和保证不再制造这种谣言的合理要求，而且还竟然无理地拒绝接受中国政府的备忘录。一九六六年一月九日，中国外交部派人把中国政府的备忘录送交苏联驻华大使馆；第二天，苏联驻华大使馆把中国政府的备忘录退回了中国外交部。一九六六年一月十一日，中国政府又通过驻苏联大使馆派人把这份备忘录送交苏联外交部；当天，苏联外交部也把这份备忘录退回了中国驻苏联大使馆。苏联方面的这种做法不能不被认为，在恶化中苏两国的国家关系的道路上又迈出了新的一步。
    中国有关方面指出，苏联方面散布所谓中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资过境这种谣言，已经不打自招。其所以要无休止地这样做，显然是别有用心的，说穿了，就是要诬蔑中国，挑拨中越关系，为美帝国主义效劳。不管苏联政府怎样顽固地拒绝接受中国政府的备忘录，拒绝公开澄清这些谣言，结果只能是欲盖弥彰。
