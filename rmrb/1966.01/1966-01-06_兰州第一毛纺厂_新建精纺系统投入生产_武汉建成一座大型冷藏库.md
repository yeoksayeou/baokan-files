    Lanzhou No. 1 Woolen Mill
    New Worsted Spinning System Put Into Production
    Wuhan Builds a Large Cold Storage
    △The new worsted spinning system of Lanzhou No. 1 Woolen Mill was officially put into production on January 3.
    The new worsted spinning system has 5,000 wool spinning spindles and can produce more than one million meters of various worsted wool fabrics annually.
    The official commissioning of the new worsted spinning system will play an important role in changing the face of Gansu's wool textile industry and adding new varieties of colors and patterns. In addition to producing various pure wool worsted products, it can also use synthetic fibers, viscose fibers, and wool blends to produce other varieties of worsted products.
    The automatic looms, spinning machines, and other equipment installed in the new worsted spinning system are all domestically produced. The process layout of the factory building is relatively reasonable, and its temperature and humidity can be freely adjusted.
    △Wuhan has recently built a large cold storage. Its storage capacity is equivalent to 5.7 times the total capacity of several cold storages in the Wuhan area before liberation.
    The workers who designed and built this cold storage adhered to starting from reality, and on the premise of ensuring quality, broke the foreign framework of excessively large insulation safety factors for cold storages, and thinned the insulation layer of the first floor's ground by five centimeters. This modification alone saved 40,000 yuan in investment and a large amount of valuable insulation materials, and correspondingly expanded the capacity of the cold storage.
    Hubei Province is one of the important producing areas of pigs, fish, and eggs in China. The completion of this large cold storage will play an important role in expanding the amount of pork, fish, and eggs in cold storage and ensuring the needs of the people's lives.

    兰州第一毛纺厂
    新建精纺系统投入生产
    武汉建成一座大型冷藏库
    △兰州第一毛纺厂新建的精纺系统，已在一月三日正式投入生产。
    新建精纺系统拥有五千个毛纺锭，每年可以生产各种精纺毛织品一百多万米。
    新建精纺系统的正式投产，对改变甘肃毛纺工业面貌，增加新的花色品种，都将起重要作用。它除了可以生产各种纯毛精纺产品外，还可以利用合成纤维、粘胶纤维和羊毛混纺，生产其他品种的精纺产品。
    新建精纺系统安装的自动化织机、纺机和其他设备都是国产的。厂房的工艺布置比较合理，它的温度和湿度都是可以自由调节的。
    △武汉最近建成一座大型冷藏库。它的库容量相当于解放前武汉地区几个冷藏库总容量的五点七倍。
    设计和兴建这座冷藏库的职工坚持从实际出发，在保证质量的前提下打破了冷库绝缘安全系数过大的洋框框，把一楼的地坪绝缘层减薄了五厘米。仅这一项修改，就节约了投资四万元和大量的贵重绝缘材料，并且相应地扩大了这个冷藏库的容量。
    湖北省是我国猪、鱼、蛋的重要产地之一。这座大型冷藏库的建成，对扩大猪肉、鱼、蛋的冷藏量，保证人民生活需要起着重要作用。
