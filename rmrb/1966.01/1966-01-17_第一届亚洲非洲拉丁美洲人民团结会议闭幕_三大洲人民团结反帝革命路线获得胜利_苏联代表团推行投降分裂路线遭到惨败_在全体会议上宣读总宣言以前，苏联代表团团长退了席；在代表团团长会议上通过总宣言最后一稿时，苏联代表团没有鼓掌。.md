    First Tricontinental Conference Closes
    People's United Anti-Imperialist Revolutionary Line of the Three Continents Achieves Victory
    Soviet Delegation's Line of Capitulation and Splitting Suffers Miserable Defeat
    Head of Soviet Delegation Left the Session Before the Declaration Was Read at Plenary Session; Soviet Delegation Didn't Applaud at Heads of Delegations Meeting After Last Revision of the Declaration
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 15th: The First Tricontinental Conference closed in Havana on January 15th. The final plenary session of the conference was held on the morning of the 15th, and a resolution firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the general declaration of the conference, the general political resolution, and a sub-resolution condemning imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States, and supporting national liberation movements were adopted. The closing ceremony was held at the Chaplin Theater that evening. Cuban Premier Castro delivered a speech at the closing ceremony.
    After a long and repeated struggle, the conference resulted in the miserable defeat of the erroneous line pursued by the Soviet delegation, which attempted not to oppose imperialism and to split the unity movement of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the victory of the correct line that reflects the wishes of hundreds of millions of people on the three continents and adheres to the cause of unity against imperialism.
    The general declaration adopted by the conference pointed out that the current international situation is favorable to the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed people and the development of the anti-imperialist cause, and clearly pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the people of the world, and that the primary task of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is to defeat U.S. imperialism.
    The "Resolution on Vietnam" adopted by the conference condemned the aggression of U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people, exposed the lies of the "bombing pause" and "fourteen-point proposal" played by Johnson, and condemned his launch of a "peace offensive" as a cover for expanding the war.
    The general political resolution adopted by the conference condemned the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and supported the just struggles of the people of all countries on the three continents against imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States.
    The conference also adopted a series of sub-resolutions supporting the anti-American struggles of the people of Korea, Japan, Dominica, Congo (Leopoldville), Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Southern Rhodesia, Thailand, and other countries.
    The conference frustrated the long-planned conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists to abolish the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization. Throughout the conference, the Soviet delegation attempted to establish a new Tricontinental organization to replace the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, which has had eight years of anti-imperialist struggle history, in an attempt to control the mass organizations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and their anti-imperialist activities. The vast majority of delegates opposed discussing issues related to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization at the conference, and solemnly pointed out that the conference had no right to dissolve the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization. Under the premise that the issues related to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization were not discussed, the conference, after repeated discussions and consultations, decided to temporarily establish an executive secretariat of the Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization in Havana. This executive secretariat is temporary, and its task is to implement the resolutions of this conference, prepare for the next conference, and submit a draft charter for the establishment of a permanent organization to the next conference. At the same time, it was also decided that the Second Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Conference would be held in Cairo in 1968.
    This executive secretariat is composed of a secretary-general and twelve member states. The member states are: Secretary-General Cuba; Asian Secretary: South Vietnam, North Korea, Syria, Pakistan; African Secretary: United Arab Republic, Guinea, one member state selected from Portuguese colonial countries, Congo (Leopoldville); Latin American Secretary: Venezuela, Dominica, Puerto Rico, Chile.
    The conference was consistently permeated with a fierce struggle between the revolutionary line of unity against imperialism of the three continents and the Soviet revisionist line. The Soviet representatives attempted to use the so-called "joint action" to cover up their ugly face of US-Soviet cooperation dominating the world, and wanted to insert this so-called "joint action" into the resolution of the conference. Wu Xueqian, head of the Chinese delegation, raised ten questions related to joint action in his speech, which the Soviet representatives never dared to answer. Representatives from Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaya also criticized this so-called joint action of recognizing the enemy as a friend in their speeches. At the political committee meeting of the conference, the Soviet representatives insisted on inserting a so-called resolution on the issue of peaceful coexistence, which was strongly opposed by representatives from China, Japan, Indonesia, North Korea, Malaya, Thailand, Uganda, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Southwest Africa, Nepal, Pakistan, and other countries. Many representatives pointed out that advocating peaceful coexistence at such a Tricontinental conference violates the purpose of the Tricontinental conference, does not conform to the wishes of the vast majority of representatives, and will ruin the Tricontinental conference. During the conference, the Soviet delegation also opposed condemning the United Nations, the tool of U.S. imperialism, and attempted to peddle the so-called "peaceful resolution" in the Vietnam issue. The Soviet delegation's various conspiracies exposed its true face of false anti-imperialism, false support, and false unity to the conference.
    At the plenary session on the 15th, the resolution on the Vietnam issue and the general declaration were read out. After the reading, the delegates stood up and applauded enthusiastically. People saw that the head of the Soviet delegation left the session before the general declaration was read out. It is reported that when the final draft of the general declaration was adopted at the heads of delegations meeting held at two o'clock in the morning on the same day, the Soviet delegation did not applaud.
    Finally, after a speech by the chairman of the conference, Cuban Foreign Minister Roa, the conference was declared closed.

    第一届亚洲非洲拉丁美洲人民团结会议闭幕
    三大洲人民团结反帝革命路线获得胜利
    苏联代表团推行投降分裂路线遭到惨败
    在全体会议上宣读总宣言以前，苏联代表团团长退了席；在代表团团长会议上通过总宣言最后一稿时，苏联代表团没有鼓掌。
    新华社哈瓦那十五日电　第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议十五日在哈瓦那闭幕。十五日上午举行了大会最后一次全体会议，通过了坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的决议，会议的总宣言，总政治决议和谴责以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、支援民族解放运动的分决议。当天晚上在卓别麟剧院举行了闭幕式。古巴总理卡斯特罗在闭幕式上发表了讲话。
    会议经过长时间的反复的斗争，使得苏联代表团企图推行的不反帝、分裂亚非拉美人民团结运动的错误路线遭到惨败，反映三洲亿万人民愿望的坚持团结反帝事业的正确路线获得胜利。
    会议通过的总宣言，指出了当前国际形势有利于被压迫人民的革命斗争和反帝事业的发展，并且明确地指出美帝国主义是全世界人民不可调和的敌人，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民当前首要任务是击败美帝国主义。
    会议通过的“关于越南的决议”，谴责了美帝国主义对越南人民的侵略，揭露了约翰逊玩弄的“暂停轰炸”和“十四点建议”的骗局，谴责他发动“和平攻势”是掩盖扩大战争的阴谋手法。
    会议通过的总政治决议谴责了美帝国主义的侵略罪行，支持三大洲各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的正义斗争。
    会议还通过了一系列分决议，支持朝鲜、日本、多米尼加、刚果（利）、老挝、柬埔寨、印度尼西亚、南罗得西亚、泰国等国人民的反美斗争。
     会议挫败了苏联修正主义者蓄谋已久的想要取消亚非人民团结组织的阴谋。苏联代表团在整个会议进程中一直企图建立一个新的三洲机构来代替已有八年反帝斗争历史的亚非人民团结组织，妄想借此控制亚、非、拉美群众组织及其反帝活动。绝大多数代表都反对会议讨论有关亚非人民团结组织的问题，并且严正指出会议无权解散亚非人民团结组织。会议在不讨论有关亚非人民团结组织问题的前提下，经过反复的讨论和协商，决定临时在哈瓦那建立一个亚非拉美人民团结组织的执行书记处，这一执行书记处是临时性的，它的任务是执行本届会议的决议，筹备下届会议，并且向下届会议提出关于建立常设机构的章程草案。同时还决定第二届亚非拉美人民团结会议于一九六八年在开罗举行。
    这一执行书记处是由一个总书记和十二个成员国组成的。其成员国是：总书记古巴；亚洲书记：越南南方、朝鲜、叙利亚、巴基斯坦；非洲书记是：阿联、几内亚、从葡属殖民地国家中选一个成员国、刚果（利）；拉丁美洲书记是：委内瑞拉、多米尼加、波多黎各、智利。
    会议自始至终贯穿着三大洲人民团结反帝的革命路线和苏联修正主义路线之间的激烈的斗争。苏联代表企图以所谓“联合行动”来掩饰其美苏合作主宰世界的丑恶面貌，并且想要把这一个所谓“联合行动”塞进会议的决议中去。中国代表团团长吴学谦在发言中提出了有关联合行动的十个问题，苏联代表始终不敢回答。日本、印度尼西亚、泰国和马来亚代表也在发言中批判了这种认敌作友的所谓联合行动。在会议的政治委员会会议上，苏联代表硬要塞进一个所谓关于和平共处问题的决议，遭到了中国、日本、印度尼西亚、朝鲜、马来亚、泰国、乌干达、巴苏陀兰、贝专纳、西南非、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦等国代表的强烈反对。不少代表指出，在这样的三洲会议上鼓吹什么和平共处，是违反三洲会议宗旨的，是不符合绝大多数代表的愿望的，是要毁掉三洲会议的。苏联代表团还在会议过程中，反对谴责美帝国主义的工具联合国，并且企图在越南问题上兜售所谓“和平解决”的货色。苏联代表团这种种阴谋向会议暴露了它自己的假反帝、假支持、假团结的真面目。
    在十五日的全体会议上，宣读了关于越南问题的决议和总宣言。宣读后，代表们起立热烈鼓掌。人们看到，在宣读总宣言以前，苏联代表团团长退了席。据悉，在当天清晨两点钟举行的代表团团长会议上通过总宣言最后一稿时，苏联代表团没有鼓掌。
    最后，会议主席古巴外长罗亚讲话后，宣告会议结束。
