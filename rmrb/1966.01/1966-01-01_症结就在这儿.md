    The crux of the matter lies here
    Some comrades have suggested: "The most urgent problem for county committee leadership to solve currently is not the question of 'serving whom,' but the question of 'how to serve.'" Before I participated in the Socialist Education Movement, I would have agreed with these views. But today, I disagree. I have participated in the revolution for more than a dozen years, and I can't say that I don't have any thought of serving the people under the education of the Party. However, in retrospect, I didn't truly understand the meaning of "serving the people" in the past. I once mistakenly believed that after the issue of ownership was resolved, there would no longer be a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, or a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Under these circumstances, I relaxed my efforts in self-remolding and became preoccupied with personal gains and losses. But if anyone said that I hadn't truly established the idea of serving the people, I would feel greatly wronged, and I would argue: I've participated in the revolution for more than a dozen years, how could I not understand this issue? Now I realize that I truly didn't understand.
    Through nearly two years of participating in the practice of class struggle, I have seen more profoundly that class struggle is manifested on all fronts, in people's minds, and frequently in the relationship between "me" and the "collective," which is the question of "serving whom."
    I believe that some veteran comrades also have this problem, and the current need for the revolutionization of county-level leadership is still to solve this problem.

    症结就在这儿
    有的同志提出：“县委领导当前最迫切要解决的问题，不是‘为谁服务’的问题，而是‘怎样服务’的问题。”在我没有参加社会主义教育运动以前，这些认识我是会同意的。可是今天我就不同意了。我参加革命十几年，在党的教育下不能说没有一点为人民服务的思想。但是，回过头来检查，我过去并没有真正懂得“为人民服务”的意义。我曾经错误地认为：在所有制的问题解决了以后，就不再存在无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争了。在这种情况下，就放松了自我改造的努力，思想上患得患失。但要是谁说我没有真正树立为人民服务的思想，我会感到莫大的委屈，我就会辩解：我参加革命十几年了，连这个问题还不懂？现在想想确实是不懂。
    通过近两年参加阶级斗争的实践，我比较深刻地看到了阶级斗争表现在各条战线上，表现在人的思想中，经常表现在“我”和“集体”的关系上，也就是“为谁服务”的问题上。
    我认为，有些老同志也存在这个问题，县一级领导革命化，当前需要解决的仍然是这个问题。
