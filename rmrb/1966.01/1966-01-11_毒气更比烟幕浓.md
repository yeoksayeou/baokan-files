    Poison Gas is Thicker Than Smoke Screen
    By Our Staff Commentator

    The Johnson administration is engaging in a massive "peace" swindle, desperately trying to appear friendly. However, it is precisely amidst this deafening clamor of "peace" that the American aggressors are frantically using poison gas on the South Vietnamese battlefield, massacring innocent people on a large scale. The viciousness, brutality, insidiousness, and ruthlessness of U.S. imperialism truly surpass anything seen in the history of all aggressors.

    What is particularly appalling is that the U.S. military authorities in Vietnam openly announced that they would widely use this inhuman chemical weapon, condemned by world opinion and strictly prohibited by international conventions, in the Vietnam War, and shamelessly claimed that it was a "humanitarian thing." This shows that U.S. imperialism simply does not take international laws and world opinion seriously. It has its own executioner's ethics and its own robber's logic. If we do not severely condemn and stop such heinous crimes by the American aggressors, what justice is there left for humanity?

    Johnson is sending countless smoke bombs to the world, attempting to cover people's eyes, but the poison gas bombs dropped in large quantities by American aggressors in South Vietnam are enough to sweep away the smoke screen he painstakingly spreads. People can see more clearly that the Johnson administration is not a "seeker of peace" but a war maniac whose nature is difficult to change.

    The statement of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again exposes the hypocritical face of the Johnson administration and reiterates the solemn position of the Vietnamese people: The U.S. government must stop its war of aggression, must withdraw all the troops and weapons of the United States and its lackeys from South Vietnam, must unconditionally and permanently cease all acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and must respect and strictly implement the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue. The Vietnam issue can only be resolved based on these demands of the Vietnamese people. Johnson's fourteen points, go to hell!

    毒气更比烟幕浓
    本报评论员
    约翰逊政府大搞“和平”骗局，竭力装出一副与人为善的样子。但是，正是在这种“和平”喧嚷震耳欲聋的时候，美国侵略者在南越战场上疯狂地使用毒气，大规模屠杀无辜人民。美帝国主义的凶恶、残暴、阴险、毒辣，真是人类历史上一切侵略者都难以望其项背。
    尤其令人发指的是，侵越美军当局明目张胆地宣布，要在侵越战争中广泛使用为世界舆论所谴责和国际公约所严禁的这种灭绝人性的化学武器，而且还厚颜无耻地说什么这是“人道主义的东西”。这说明美帝国主义是根本不把国际法规和世界舆论放在眼里的。它有自己的刽子手的伦理，有自己的强盗的逻辑。对于美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行，如果不加以严厉的谴责和制止，那还有什么人类的正义可言。
    约翰逊向全世界发出无数的烟幕弹，企图用以掩盖人们的眼睛，但是美国侵略者在南越大量投掷的毒气弹足以把他苦心散布的烟幕一扫而光。人们可以更清楚地看到，约翰逊政府并不是什么“和平的寻求者”，而是本性难移的战争狂人。
    越南外交部的声明再一次揭穿约翰逊政府假仁假义的面目，并且重申了越南人民的严正立场：美国政府必须停止侵略战争，必须把美国及其仆从的军队、武器全部撤出越南南方，必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的一切战争行动，必须尊重和严正履行一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。越南问题只能根据越南人民的这些主张解决。约翰逊的十四点主张，见它的鬼去罢！
