    Fushun Coal Mine has recently adopted a set of high-efficiency, large-capacity hydraulic hoisting equipment in its deep shafts. This equipment can hoist approximately one hundred tons of coal per hour, and has hoisted nearly one million tons of coal to date.
    Compared to the original winch multi-stage hoisting method used by the mine, the new hoisting equipment can reduce personnel by fifty percent, and greatly reduce the labor intensity of the workers.
    This set of hydraulic hoisting equipment was jointly researched and tested successfully by the Fushun Mining Bureau of Liaoning, the Tangshan Coal Science Research Institute, and relevant manufacturing departments. It consists of a main water pump, inlet pipe, coal discharge pipe, and pot-type coal feeder. Utilizing water pressure, it can transport coal from the bottom of a six-hundred-meter-deep shaft to the surface. It can also function as coal selection.

    抚顺煤矿采用高效率水力提升设备
    抚顺煤矿在深井中新采用了一套高效率大容积的水力提升设备。这套设备每小时能提升煤一百吨左右，到目前为止已经提升了将近一百万吨的煤。
    同这个矿原来采用的绞车多段提升法比较，新的提升设备可以减少百分之五十的人员，工人的劳动强度也大大减轻了。
    这套水力提升设备是辽宁抚顺矿务局、唐山煤炭科学研究所和有关制造部门共同研究试验成功的。它由主水泵、入水管、排煤管和缶式喂煤机等组成，利用水的压力，可以把煤从六百米深的井底运上地面。它还能兼作选煤的活。
