    Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to learn from the People's Liberation Army at the end of 1963, especially since the National Financial and Trade Political Work Conference in February of last year, political and ideological work in the financial and trade departments has been greatly strengthened. However, this is only a good start and should not be overestimated. Compared with the People's Liberation Army, Daqing, and Dazhai, the gap is still very large. We must not be complacent, arrogant, content with the status quo, and unenterprising. We must also see that in the Third Five-Year Plan, the tasks of the financial and trade departments are very arduous. Only by further highlighting politics can we continue to move forward, achieve greater victories, and complete the important tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people.

    To further highlight politics, we must better study Chairman Mao's works. We must take Chairman Mao's works as the highest instruction for all our work. This is the most fundamental issue in highlighting politics. Only when leading cadres take the lead in studying and applying them well can they motivate everyone to study and apply them well. This is both the key to popularization and the key to improvement. Leading cadres should also work hard on the word "application" when studying Chairman Mao's works. They should not only use them to improve their work, but first and foremost to transform their thinking; not only to transform the thinking of others, but first and foremost to transform their own thinking.

    Studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming our thinking mainly involves two aspects: one is to realize ideological revolutionization, and the other is to master materialist dialectics. To realize ideological revolutionization, we must, like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly establish the proletarian world outlook, and wholeheartedly serve the revolution and the people. This requires continuous and resolute struggle against individualism and selfish thoughts. Mastering materialist dialectics mainly means using Chairman Mao's viewpoint of "one divides into two" to treat all things and grasp objective laws.

    To further highlight politics, we must take class struggle as the key link, take the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads as the key link, and better strengthen political and ideological work. The great socialist education movement is the central task of the entire Party at present, the largest political work of the financial and trade departments at present, and the fundamental construction in political, economic, organizational, and ideological aspects. It is our fundamental plan and must be grasped and carried out well. In units where the socialist education movement has not been carried out or has already been completed, attention should be paid to strengthening regular political and ideological work.

    To further highlight politics, we must also adhere to the implementation of "one orientation, two services, and three viewpoints." During the Third Five-Year Plan, the financial and trade departments have much work to do in implementing "one orientation, two services, and three viewpoints." Of particular importance is that financial and trade work must be oriented towards the countryside and serve the development of agricultural production.

    In order to better implement "one orientation, two services, and three viewpoints," we must do financial and trade work as political work and as mass work. Our financial and trade departments must, like the People's Liberation Army, use the education of "supporting the government and cherishing the people" and "being the sons and daughters of the people" to educate all commanders and fighters, use "one orientation, two services, and three viewpoints" to educate all cadres and workers, and do financial and trade work in such a way that it is as intimately linked with the people as the People's Liberation Army is, and is as welcomed and loved by the people. In this way, the people will regard financial and trade work as their own vital cause. In this way, we will have a reliable guarantee for completing various work tasks, and we will be invincible.

    进一步突出政治，争取更大的胜利！
    ——《大公报》元旦社论摘要
    财贸部门从一九六三年年底党中央号召学习解放军以来，特别是去年二月全国财贸政治工作会议以来，政治思想工作有了很大的加强。但这只是一个良好的开端，不能估计过高。同解放军比，同大庆比，同大寨比，差距还很大，不能故步自封，骄傲自满，安于现状，不求进取。还要看到，在第三个五年计划中，财贸部门的任务十分艰巨，只有进一步突出政治，才能继续前进，取得更大的胜利，完成党和人民交付的重大任务。
    要进一步突出政治，必须更好地学习毛主席著作。我们一定要把毛主席著作作为各项工作的最高指示。这是突出政治中最根本的问题。领导干部带头学好用好，才能带动大家学好用好，这既是普及的关键，也是提高的关键。领导干部学习毛主席著作，同样要在“用”字上狠下功夫，不仅要用来改进工作，首先要用来改造思想；不仅要用来改造别人的思想，首先要用来改造自己的思想。
    学习毛主席著作，改造思想，主要有两个方面：一个是实现思想革命化，一个是掌握唯物辩证法。实现思想革命化，就是要象雷锋、王杰那样，按照毛主席的教导，牢固地树立无产阶级世界观，一心一意为革命，全心全意为人民服务。这就需要不断同个人主义私心杂念作坚决的斗争。掌握唯物辩证法，主要是要用毛主席关于一分为二的观点，来对待一切事物，掌握客观规律。
    要进一步突出政治，必须以阶级斗争为纲，以社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争为纲，更好地加强政治思想工作。伟大的社会主义教育运动是当前全党的中心工作，是当前财贸部门最大的政治工作，是在政治、经济、组织、思想方面的基本建设，是我们的根本大计，必须抓好、搞好。在没有进行社会主义教育运动或者运动已经进行完了的单位，要注意加强经常性的政治思想工作。
    要进一步突出政治，还必须坚持贯彻一个方针、两个服务、三大观点。在第三个五年计划期间，财贸部门贯彻一个方针、两个服务、三大观点，有许多工作要做。其中特别重要的是财贸工作要面向农村，为发展农业生产服务。
    为了更好地贯彻一个方针、两个服务、三大观点，必须把财贸工作当做政治工作来做，当做群众工作来做。我们财贸部门要象解放军用拥政爱民、做人民子弟兵来教育全体指战员那样，用一个方针、两个服务、三大观点来教育全体干部和职工，要把财贸工作做得象解放军那样同人民群众水乳交融，那样受人民群众的欢迎和爱戴。这样，人民群众就会把财贸工作当成是自己的切身事业。这样，我们完成各项工作任务就有了可靠的保证，我们就会无往而不胜。
