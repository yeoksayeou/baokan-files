    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva – The Chinese Acrobatics Art Troupe, laden with the friendship of the Swiss people, left here on the 17th to return to China.

    From January 7th to 11th, the Chinese Acrobatics Art Troupe performed five shows in Lausanne and Geneva, receiving a warm welcome from nearly 10,000 spectators.

    Whether at the Beaulieu Theatre in Lausanne or the Vernets Ice Rink in Geneva, the troupe's two-and-a-half-hour performance won long and enthusiastic applause from the audience. Throughout the performance, exclamations of surprise and laughter could be heard continuously. Many audience members generally praised the acrobatics art troupe's performances as "extremely good," "miraculous," and "unbelievable." Programs such as "Jar Balancing," "Lion Dance," and "Cycle Stunts" were particularly warmly received. At the Vernets Ice Rink, after the troupe's performance, the audience clapped rhythmically to the music played by the band, reluctant to leave their seats.

    During the performances, newspapers in both Lausanne and Geneva published articles warmly praising the Chinese Acrobatics Art Troupe's performance as "rich and colorful" and "extraordinary feats." Some newspapers also praised in their commentary the Chinese People's Government for vigorously encouraging and developing acrobatics art, and for providing great care for the training of the performers.
