    Combining Labor and Study: Teaching Students Dynamically and Vigorously
    Good Results from Part-Work, Part-Study Programs in Some Majors at Thirteen Higher Education Institutions in Sichuan
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th) Last year, thirteen full-time higher education institutions in Sichuan Province, including Sichuan University, Sichuan Medical College, Southwest Normal College, and Chengdu Institute of Technology, piloted part-work (farming), part-study classes for first and second-year students in some majors.
    These schools' part-work (farming), part-study classes included twenty-six majors in engineering, science, agriculture, and liberal arts, with a total of more than 2,400 students. They promoted the spirit of hard work and thrift in running schools, like the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, requiring little or no state investment, and creating diverse work-study and farming-study environments through their own efforts.
    In piloting the part-work (farming), part-study system, all schools paid attention to correctly handling the relationship between work (farming) and study, ensuring the quality of teaching. They also paid attention to creating experience in teaching content and methods.
    Students in these higher education institutions' part-work (farming), part-study classes came into contact with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants during labor, and their thoughts and feelings gradually changed, making them more consciously revolutionary. Many schools' part-work (farming), part-study classes launched a surge in studying Chairman Mao's works, and many people were able to study and apply them flexibly, consciously transforming themselves.
    Because labor and study promoted each other in these part-work (farming), part-study classes, the students studied more actively and dynamically. Southwest Agricultural College raised some questions that were previously considered unsuitable for first-year students, assigning them to investigate in the fields and conduct scientific group activities, greatly enriching the content of their studies.

    劳动学习结合　教学生动活泼
    四川十三所高等院校部分专业半工半读成绩好
    据新华社成都七日电　四川省的四川大学、四川医学院、西南师范学院、成都工学院等十三所全日制高等院校，去年都在部分专业的一、二年级学生中试办了半工（农）半读班。
    这些学校的半工（农）半读班包括工科、理科、农科和文科的二十六个专业，共有学生二千四百多名。他们发扬延安抗大勤俭办学的精神，不要或少要国家投资，自己动手开创多种多样的工读和耕读环境。
    各校在试行半工（农）半读中都注意正确处理工（耕）读关系，保证教学质量。并在教学内容和教学方法上，注意创造经验。
    这些高等院校半工（农）半读班的学生在劳动中同工人和贫下中农接触，思想感情逐渐起了变化，革命的自觉性更高了。许多学校的半工（农）半读班级都掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮，不少人并能活学活用，自觉改造自己。
    这些半工（农）半读班由于劳动和学习相互促进，学生们学习得更加主动和生动活泼。西南农学院把一些过去认为一年级学生不能探索的问题提出来交给一年级学生，让他们到田间调查，开展科学小组活动，大大丰富了学习内容。
