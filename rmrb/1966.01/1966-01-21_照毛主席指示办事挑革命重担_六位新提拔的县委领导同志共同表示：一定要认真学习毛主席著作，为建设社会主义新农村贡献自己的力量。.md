    Following Chairman Mao's Instructions and Taking on Revolutionary Burdens
    Six newly promoted county committee leaders jointly stated: We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works and contribute our strength to building a new socialist countryside.
    (Our newspaper's report) In the past year, a large number of outstanding young cadres have been successively promoted to responsible positions at the level of the Party's county committees. These new county committee secretaries and deputy secretaries are in high spirits with revolutionary enthusiasm, determined to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and contribute their strength to building a new socialist countryside in their new work posts.
    Today, this newspaper publishes articles by six new county committee secretaries and deputy secretaries (see page two). Zhou Mingshan, the former Party Branch Secretary of Nanliu Brigade in Jiang County and now the Secretary of the Jiang County Party Committee, said that in his new position, he will hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study Chairman Mao's works, equip himself with proletarian thoughts and feelings and lofty revolutionary ideals, dare to make revolution, be good at making revolution, and actively shoulder revolutionary burdens. Dong Zhiwen, the Secretary of the Pingjiang County Party Committee, said, "The most fundamental loyalty to the revolution is loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought." Therefore, he is determined to take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and must master it. All comrades who have newly joined the county committee leadership feel that Mao Zedong Thought has given them tremendous encouragement. Liu Yunrui, the Deputy Secretary of the Gu'an County Party Committee, said that after studying Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, he has greatly strengthened his determination to overcome difficulties and dare to practice, and he will definitely make achievements in the new year to respond to the Party's expectations.
    Many new county committee secretaries attach great importance to participating in labor, strictly demanding themselves to always maintain the true qualities of the working people, wholeheartedly serving the people, and not becoming divorced from the masses. Guo Jianjie, the Secretary of the Danleng County Party Committee, stated that after the spring plowing begins, he will carry a new hoe, go to the front line to participate in production, and lead production.
    These newly promoted cadres modestly learn from the masses and maintain a good style of close contact with the masses.
    A large number of new forces have been promoted, and new and old cadres learn from each other, help each other, unite and fight, bringing a brand new atmosphere.
    Since the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the proposal to resolutely, boldly, and gradually cultivate and promote successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, Party committees at all levels have, based on their own circumstances, and after careful selection, successively and actively promoted those young cadres who are highly class conscious, strong in work ability, and closely connected with the masses to responsible positions at all levels. This instruction of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong has been welcomed by new and old cadres and the broad masses. Our revolutionary cause will continue to gain fresh blood and will surely maintain its wonderful youth.

    照毛主席指示办事挑革命重担
    六位新提拔的县委领导同志共同表示：一定要认真学习毛主席著作，为建设社会主义新农村贡献自己的力量。
    本报讯  过去一年，大批优秀的年轻的干部陆续被提拔到党的县委会一级的负责岗位上来。这些新的县委书记、副书记革命精神振奋，意气风发，决心活学活用毛泽东思想，在新的工作岗位上，为建设社会主义新农村而贡献自己的力量。
    今天，本报选登了六位新的县委书记、副书记的文章（见第二版）。原任绛县南柳大队支部书记、现任绛县县委书记周明山同志说，在新的岗位上，他要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地学习毛主席的著作，使自己具有无产阶级的思想感情和远大的革命理想，敢于革命，善于革命，积极挑起革命重担。平江县委书记董志文同志说，“忠于革命最根本的是忠于毛泽东思想”，因此，决心带头学，带头用，一定要把毛泽东思想学到手。新参加县委领导工作的同志，无不感到毛泽东思想给予自己以极大的鼓舞力量。固安县委副书记刘云瑞同志说，他学了毛泽东同志关于培养无产阶级接班人的指示后，大大增强了自己不怕困难、勇于实践的决心，一定在新的一年里做出成绩，回答党的期望。
    许多新县委书记都十分重视参加劳动，严格要求自己永远保持劳动人民的本色，全心全意为人民服务，不脱离群众。丹棱县委书记郭建杰同志表示，春耕开始后，就要扛起新锄头，到第一线去参加生产，领导生产。
    这些新提拔的干部虚心向群众学习，保持了密切联系群众的好作风。
    新生力量被大批提拔上来，新老干部之间互相学习，互相帮助，团结战斗，带来了崭新的气象。
    自从党中央和毛泽东同志提出坚决、放手、逐步培养提拔无产阶级革命事业的接班人以来，各级党委已根据自己的情况，经过慎重挑选，陆续把那些阶级觉悟高，工作能力强，密切联系群众的年轻干部，积极提升到各级负责岗位上来。党中央和毛泽东同志这个指示，受到了各级新老干部和广大群众的欢迎。我们的革命事业不断获得新鲜血液，定将永葆其美妙的青春。
