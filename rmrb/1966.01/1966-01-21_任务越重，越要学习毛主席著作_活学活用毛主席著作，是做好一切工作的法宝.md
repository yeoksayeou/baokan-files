    The heavier the task, the more we must study Chairman Mao's writings
    Creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings is a magic weapon for doing all work well
    In the new situation of struggle, the tasks assigned to me by the Party are becoming greater and the demands are becoming higher. I am determined to further study Chairman Mao's writings well in order to meet the needs of the new situation.
    Last December, I visited the "National Exhibition of Advanced Agricultural Models of the Dazhai Type" in Beijing. The advanced deeds of the fifty-two advanced units all showed that creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings is a magic weapon for doing all work well. Where they studied Chairman Mao's writings well, there the people's consciousness was high, and production was good. Recalling my work over the past few years, I looked for gaps, and a fundamental gap was the ideological gap. Why? It is because I studied Chairman Mao's writings poorly.
    In accordance with the spirit of learning what is lacking and learning what is useful, in order to meet new tasks and adapt to new needs, I have made a plan for studying Chairman Mao's writings:
    New revolutionary undertakings require new working methods. I plan to re-study "Methods of Work of Party Committees," "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Surveys'," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" to improve my leadership methods and do a good job in all work. The new leadership position requires me to pay more attention to the cultivation of ideological consciousness. I want to further study articles such as "Combat Liberalism," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In terms of epistemology, I want to further study articles such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War." Study and apply them repeatedly, learn to master the dialectical viewpoint of dividing one into two, and act in accordance with objective laws. We must continue to study articles such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" so that my stand is clear and my attitude is firm in the storms of class struggle. In short, we must study repeatedly and learn in struggle, so that our thinking is constantly revolutionized. We must dare to revolutionize and be good at revolution.
    1966 is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. I want to take "application" as the center and achieve "five haves and three studies." The "five haves" are: first, have proletarian feelings; second, have lofty revolutionary ideals; third, have a spirit of conscious revolution; fourth, have perseverance; and fifth, have a resolute and vigorous work style. The "three studies" are: study the fundamental viewpoints deeply and firmly, study the commonly used articles proficiently and apply them correctly, and read through and read more to learn the basic spirit of Chairman's thoughts. While studying Chairman Mao's writings, learn from the masses, follow the mass line, and listen to the masses; learn from the old cadres, learn the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary style of the older generation; learn from heroes such as Lei Feng and Wang Jie, and learn from their spirit of not fearing hardship or death and sacrificing everything for the revolution. Through study, thoroughly transform my own thinking, thoroughly establish a revolutionary outlook on life, truly revolutionize my thinking, and dedicate my life to the revolutionary cause.

### 任务越重，越要学习毛主席著作  活学活用毛主席著作，是做好一切工作的法宝

专栏：

    任务越重，越要学习毛主席著作
    活学活用毛主席著作，是做好一切工作的法宝
    在新的斗争形势下，党交给我的任务越来越大，要求越来越高了。我决心进一步学好毛主席著作，适应新形势的需要。
    去年十二月，我到北京参观“全国大寨式农业典型展览”，五十二个先进单位的先进事迹都说明：活学活用毛主席著作，是做好一切工作的法宝。那里学习毛主席著作好，那里人民觉悟高，生产就好。我回忆这几年来的工作，找了一下差距，一个根本差距，就是思想差距。为什么呢？就是学习毛主席著作差。
    按照缺啥学啥、用啥学啥的精神，为了迎接新的任务，适应新的需要，我作了学习毛主席著作的规划：
    新的革命事业，要求有新的工作方法，我准备重新学习《党委会的工作方法》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《“农村调查”的序言和跋》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，用来改进自己的领导方法，搞好各项工作。新的领导岗位，需要我更加注意思想意识的修养。我要进一步学习《反对自由主义》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。在认识论方面，要进一步学习《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《中国革命战争的战略问题》等文章。反复学习，反复运用，学会掌握一分为二的辩证观点，按照客观规律办事。要继续学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《论人民民主专政》等文章，使自己在阶级斗争的风浪里立场分明，态度坚决。总之，要反复学，在斗争中学，使自己思想不断革命化，要敢于革命，善于革命。
    一九六六年，是第三个五年计划头一年，我要以“用”字为中心，做到“五要三学”。“五要”是：一要有无产阶级的感情，二要有远大的革命理想，三要有自觉革命的精神，四要有坚韧不拔的毅力，五要有雷厉风行的作风。“三学”是：根本观点学深记牢，常用文章学熟用对，通读多读学主席思想的基本精神。在学习毛主席著作的同时，向群众学习，走群众路线，听群众的话；向老干部学习，学习老一辈的革命精神，革命作风；向雷锋、王杰等英雄人物学习，学习他们一不怕苦，二不怕死，一切为革命的牺牲精神。通过学习，彻底改造自己思想，彻底树立革命人生观，真正地思想革命化，为革命事业献出一生。
