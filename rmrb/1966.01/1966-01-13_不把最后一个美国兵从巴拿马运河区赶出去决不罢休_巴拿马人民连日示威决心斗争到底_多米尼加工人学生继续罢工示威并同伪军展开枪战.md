    Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch from Panama City: The people of Panama continued to hold demonstrations and rallies on the 10th and 11th to commemorate the martyrs killed by the American occupation forces two years ago, expressing the Panamanian people's determination to fight to the end to recover the Canal Zone seized by the United States.
    Residents of Panama City once again poured into the streets on the 11th, shouting slogans against US imperialism and supporting the people of the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and Congo (L), holding demonstrations. They burned two more American flags in front of the martyrs' tombs and on Saint Anne's Square.
    A banner hung in Saint Anne's Square read: "Death to the Imperialists!" and "New (Canal) Treaties Will Not Pass!"
    On the 10th, representatives from many mass organizations, professors, and student circles in Panama held a memorial meeting for the martyred in the National University of Panama. Speaking representatives emphasized: "The people will never rest until the last American soldier rolls out of our motherland's land and the Canal Zone is returned." Speakers expressed their disdain for the deceptive new canal treaty currently being negotiated between the United States and the Panamanian authorities.
    At the same time as the rally, several groups of Panamanian students tore down several American flags in Panama City.
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch from Santo Domingo: Residents and students of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, continued to hold strikes and demonstrations on the 11th, opposing US intervention and demanding that the US-controlled "Pan-American Forces" get out of the Dominican Republic.
    In the downtown area of Santo Domingo, demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and attacked patrolling vehicles with stones. An American jeep was shot at by patriotic residents in the city center. Multiple gun battles occurred in other areas of the city. Demonstrators also poured garbage onto the streets, lit oil drums and tires, and set up roadblocks. Commercial activity in the city center came to a standstill, and traffic was blocked.
    Demonstrators clashed with right-wing troops who came to suppress them. Reactionary troops opened fire on the crowd, killing one student and injuring another. Regardless of the brutal suppression, demonstrators fought back with stones and continued to gather in teams to hold protest demonstrations.
    It is reported that the protest strike, which began on the 10th by more than sixty trade union organizations, including the "United Front of Workers for Independence Trade Unions" in the Dominican Republic, is expanding to the interior of the Dominican Republic. (Attached picture)
    On January 9, more than 30,000 residents of Panama's capital held a large anti-American demonstration to commemorate the martyrs killed by the American occupation forces two years ago in the struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and to reaffirm the demand for the return of canal sovereignty.

    不把最后一个美国兵从巴拿马运河区赶出去决不罢休
    巴拿马人民连日示威决心斗争到底
    多米尼加工人学生继续罢工示威并同伪军展开枪战
    新华社十二日讯　巴拿马城消息：巴拿马人民十日、十一日继续举行示威和集会，纪念两年前被美国占领军杀害的烈士，表示巴拿马人民将为收回被美国霸占的运河区而斗争到底。
    巴拿马城的居民在十一日再次涌上街头，高呼着反对美帝国主义、支援多米尼加、越南和刚果（利）人民等口号举行示威。他们在烈士墓前和圣安娜广场上又烧毁了两面美国国旗。
    在圣安娜广场悬挂着横幅标语，上面写着：“打死帝国主义者！”、“新（运河）条约是通不过的！”
    在十日，巴拿马许多群众团体、教授和学生界的代表在巴拿马国立大学为死难烈士举行了纪念会。发言的代表强调指出：“不到最后一个美国兵滚出祖国的土地，不到运河区收归己有，人民决不罢休。”发言的人对目前美国正在和巴拿马当局谈判的欺骗性的运河新条约表示唾弃。
    和举行集会的同时，有几批巴拿马学生在巴拿马城扯下了几面美国国旗。
    新华社十二日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都圣多明各的居民和学生十一日继续举行罢工和示威，反对美国干涉，要求美国控制的“泛美部队”滚出多米尼加。
    在圣多明各闹市区，示威者高呼反美口号，用石块袭击在街上行驶的巡逻车。有一辆美国吉普车在市中心遭到爱国居民射击。在市内其他地区，发生了多次枪战。示威群众还在街头倒上垃圾，点燃石油桶和轮胎，设置路障。市中心的商业活动停顿，交通阻塞。
    示威者同前来镇压他们的右翼军队发生了冲突。反动军队向群众开枪，杀害了一名学生，还有一名学生受伤。示威群众不顾残暴的镇压，用石块进行还击，并且继续集队举行抗议示威。
    据报道，多米尼加“争取独立工会工人统一阵线”等六十多个工会组织十日开始的抗议罢工，正在扩展到多米尼加内地。（附图片）
    一月九日，巴拿马首都居民三万多人举行反美大示威，纪念两年前在维护民族主权的斗争中被美国占领军杀害的烈士们，重申收回运河主权的要求。这是示威群众在走向爱国烈士纪念碑途中，愤怒地践踏美国国旗。
