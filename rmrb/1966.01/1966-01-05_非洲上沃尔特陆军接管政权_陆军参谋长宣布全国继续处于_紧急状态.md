    According to Xinhua News Agency, Ouagadougou, January 4th: Lieutenant Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana, Chief of Staff of the Army of Upper Volta, announced on the 4th that the army had taken over the government of Upper Volta on the 3rd, and that he himself had taken over the power of the head of state.
    The army took over the government after three consecutive days of anti-government demonstrations broke out in Ouagadougou, the capital of this landlocked West African country. Starting on December 31st of last year, demonstrators strongly protested the government's 20% reduction in the salaries of state workers. President Yaméogo arrested a large number of demonstrators and declared a national "state of emergency" on January 2nd, prohibiting any public gatherings and demonstrations in the streets. On January 3rd, workers held a general strike, and thousands of people continued to demonstrate. Yaméogo dispatched military police, gendarmes, and armored vehicles, and used tear gas to suppress the demonstrations. That evening, the army announced that it was taking over the government "due to the seriousness of the situation" and deposed Yaméogo.
    When Lamizana announced on Ouagadougou radio on the 4th that he was assuming the position of head of state, he said, "Labor disputes are a serious threat." He wanted to use "all means" to maintain "public order." He also announced that the national "state of emergency" would continue and that a curfew would be implemented.

    陆军参谋长宣布全国继续处于“紧急状态”
    据新华社四日讯瓦加杜古消息：上沃尔特陆军参谋长桑古尔·拉米扎纳中校四日宣布，陆军在三日接管了上沃尔特的政权，他自己接管了国家元首的权力。

    拉米扎纳四日在瓦加杜古电台宣布他自任国家元首时说，“劳工纠纷是一个严重的威胁”。他要用“一切办法”维持
  “公共秩序”。他同时宣布全国继续处于“紧急状态”，并且实行宵禁。
