Title: Work for a Lifetime, Establish Ideals for a Lifetime

Edition: 2

    Many old comrades in the county Party committee have experienced "mountains of knives and seas of fire" and have shouldered the heavy responsibility of building a new socialist countryside. Their view of serving the people should be clear. However, some people cannot withstand the erosion of bourgeois ideology and later degenerate. There are also some people who once established the view of "serving the people," but did not establish it firmly or stably, and when faced with problems, they failed again. We must establish the view of "serving the people" for a lifetime of revolution. A slight relaxation carries the risk of stumbling.

    干一辈子树一辈子
    县委许多老同志是经历了“刀山火海”，并且又担起了建设社会主义新农村的重担，他们为人民服务的观点应该说是明确的。但是也有些人经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，后来蜕化变质。也有一些人曾经树立过
  “为人民服务”的观点，但是没有树牢，没有树稳，遇到问题就又不成了。我们干一辈子革命，就要树一辈子“为人民服务”的观点，稍微一放松，就有跌跤的危险。
