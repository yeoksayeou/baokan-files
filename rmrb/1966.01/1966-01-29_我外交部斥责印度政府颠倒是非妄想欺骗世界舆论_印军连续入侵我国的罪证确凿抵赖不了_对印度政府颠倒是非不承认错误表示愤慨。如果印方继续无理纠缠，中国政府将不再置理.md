    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th – The Chinese Foreign Ministry handed a note to the Indian Embassy in China on the 27th, refuting three notes from the Indian government dated November 26, November 27, and December 14, 1965.

    The Chinese Foreign Ministry's note pointed out that in recent months, the Indian side has intensified its invasion activities against China and has repeatedly provoked armed conflicts. The three most prominent of these occurred in Dumchele in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border, the Liguo Bridge area in the eastern sector, and the Dajila Pass on the China-Sikkim border. The Chinese government has lodged strong protests with the Indian government regarding these three armed conflict incidents. Not only does the Indian government refuse to admit its mistakes, but it also tries its best to reverse right and wrong in its notes and lodge so-called counter-protests with China. The Chinese government expresses its indignation at this.

    The Chinese Foreign Ministry's note said: Regarding the Dumchele conflict in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border on September 19, 1965, it was clearly the Indian army that invaded Chinese territory and launched an attack on Chinese civilian personnel. The Indian government insists on saying that the Chinese side "robbed and killed" Indian soldiers. The Chinese government thoroughly refuted this slander in its note of October 2, 1965. The Indian side's note of November 26, 1965, rehashed the same old tune, and even claimed to reserve the right to demand compensation, which is utterly absurd! The Indian government is the aggressor and must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of its aggression. What qualifications does it have to demand compensation? On the contrary, the Chinese government has every right to demand that the Indian government compensate for all the losses caused by India's invasion and provocations against China. These accounts are recorded one by one, and the Indian government absolutely cannot deny them!

    The note said that the armed conflict in the Liguo Bridge area in the eastern sector of the Sino-Indian border on November 24, 1965, was single-handedly provoked by the Indian army crossing the line of actual control between the two sides. In its note of November 27, 1965, the Indian government, regarding this conflict, once again used the same lies it had used for the Dumchele conflict, falsely claiming that Indian soldiers were "robbed and killed" by the Chinese side, vainly attempting to deceive the world. This is a last-ditch effort and is not worth refuting. The note also once again confused the illegal "McMahon Line" with the Sino-Indian border, attempting to legalize this illegal boundary line. This wishful thinking is absolutely impossible to realize.

    The note said that regarding the armed conflict at Dajila Pass on the China-Sikkim border on December 12, 1965, the indisputable fact is that more than thirty Indian soldiers invaded the Chinese side of Dajila Pass and launched a frenzied attack on seven Chinese border defense personnel on duty. As a result, they were beaten and fled in disgrace by the Chinese border defense personnel. Five Indian soldiers were killed in Chinese territory one hundred to five hundred meters from the border, three Indian soldiers were captured in Chinese territory, and the Indian army also abandoned a large number of weapons and ammunition in Chinese territory, leaving many shell craters. All of these are conclusive evidence of the Indian army's invasion. In its note of December 14, 1965, the Indian government falsely accused Chinese troops of "invading Sikkim" and "opening fire" on the Indian side, which is absolutely impossible to deceive anyone. The Indian side also mysteriously said that there were two to three hundred Chinese troops, that thirty were killed, and that the bodies were transported back "under the cover of darkness," which is even more of a case of slapping one's face to look fat, deceiving oneself and others. The Indian side wants to use this fabrication to cover up the embarrassing failure of its provocation, but the result can only be uglier than ever.

    The note concluded by saying that the above series of facts shows that the Indian side deliberately provoked China with invasions but has repeatedly failed and left behind many pieces of evidence. Therefore, it hastily fabricated lies, vainly attempting to shirk its responsibility for aggression and deceive world opinion. Frankly speaking, the Indian side's trick has long been exposed. If the Indian government continues to make unreasonable entanglements on the above-mentioned conflict events, the Chinese government will no longer pay attention.

    我外交部斥责印度政府颠倒是非妄想欺骗世界舆论
    印军连续入侵我国的罪证确凿抵赖不了
    对印度政府颠倒是非不承认错误表示愤慨。如果印方继续无理纠缠，中国政府将不再置理
    新华社二十八日讯　中国外交部在二十七日把一件照会交给印度驻华大使馆，驳斥印度政府在一九六五年十一月二十六日、二十七日和十二月十四日的三个来照。
    中国外交部的照会指出，最近几个月来，印度方面加紧对中国进行入侵活动，并且多次挑起武装冲突。其中最突出的三起，发生在中印边界西段的都木契列、东段的来果桥地区和中国—锡金边界的达吉山口。中国政府就这三起武装冲突事件，先后向印度政府提出了强烈抗议。印度政府不仅不承认错误，反而在来照中竭力颠倒是非，向中国提出什么反抗议。中国政府对此表示愤慨。
    中国外交部的照会说：关于一九六五年九月十九日中印边界西段的都木契列冲突，明明是印度军队侵入中国境内，向中国民政人员发动进攻，印度政府却硬说什么是中国方面“劫走并杀害了”印军。中国政府早在一九六五年十月二日的照会中就已经彻底驳斥了这种谰言。印方一九六五年十一月二十六日的来照又老调重弹，而且居然还声称要保留什么要求赔偿的权利，这真是荒唐之至！印度政府是侵略者，必须对它的侵略行为所造成的一切后果承担全部责任，有什么资格要求赔偿？相反，中国政府才有充分权利，要求印度政府赔偿印方对中国入侵挑衅所造成的一切损失。这些账都一笔一笔记录在案，印度政府是绝对赖不掉的！
    照会说，一九六五年十一月二十四日中印边界东段来果桥地区的武装冲突，是印军侵越双方实际控制线一手挑起的。印度政府在一九六五年十一月二十七日的来照中，对这次冲突，竟又照样套用它对都木契列冲突的谎话，硬说印军被中国方面“劫走并杀害”，妄图掩盖天下耳目。这真是黔驴技穷，根本不值一驳。来照还又一次把非法的“麦克马洪线”同中印边界混为一谈，企图使这条非法界线合法化。这种痴心妄想是绝对实现不了的。
    照会说，关于一九六五年十二月十二日中国—锡金边界达吉山口的武装冲突，无可争辩的事实是：印度军队三十余人侵入达吉山口中国一侧，向七名中国边防执勤人员发动了猖狂进攻，结果，反被中国边防人员打得狼狈溃逃。五名印军在中国境内一百米到五百米的地方被击毙，三名印军在中国境内被俘，印军在中国境内还丢弃了大批武器、弹药，留下了许多弹坑。所有这些都是印军入侵的确凿罪证。印度政府在一九六五年十二月十四日的来照中，反诬中国部队“侵入锡金境内”，向印方“开火”，这是绝对骗不了人的。印方还神乎其神地说什么中国部队有二三百人，被打死了三十人，尸体“在黑夜的掩护下”被运回云云，更是打肿了脸充胖子，自欺欺人。印方想以这种胡诌，来掩盖挑衅失败的狼狈相，其结果只能是丑上加丑。
    照会最后说，以上一系列事实说明：印度方面蓄意对中国入侵挑衅，却又连连失败，并且留下了累累罪证，因此就匆忙编造谎言，妄想推卸侵略罪责，欺骗世界舆论。老实说，印方的这套把戏早就被戳穿了。如果印度政府就上述冲突事件继续无理纠缠，中国政府将不再置理。
