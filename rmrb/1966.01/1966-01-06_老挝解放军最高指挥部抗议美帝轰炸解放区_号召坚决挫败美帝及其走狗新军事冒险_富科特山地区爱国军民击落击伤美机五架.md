    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Khai, 4th. According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, a spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a statement on the 3rd, strongly protesting the recent continuous intensification of bombing of the liberated areas of Xieng Khouang and Sam Neua provinces in Laos by US imperialism and its lackeys.

    The statement said that on the morning of January 2, from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, US imperialism dispatched multiple jet aircraft to conduct frantic bombing and strafing of villages along both sides of Highway 6 in Sam Neua Province, causing damage to many houses and properties of the people.

    On December 27, 1965, from 8:30 AM to 5:25 PM, US imperialism dispatched 24 F-105 aircraft to bomb Phou Kout Mountain in Xieng Khouang Province, and on the 28th, it dispatched 16 jet aircraft to bomb Phou Kout Mountain and nearby areas.

    The statement pointed out that the increasingly rampant bombing of the liberated areas of Laos by US imperialism and its lackeys is part of the US conspiracy to expand its war of aggression against Laos. The statement called on the Lao people and patriotic forces to further heighten their vigilance and resolutely thwart the new military adventure conspiracy of US imperialism and its lackeys.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Khai, 5th. According to a "Voice of Laos" Radio broadcast: On New Year's Day, the patriotic army and people in the Phou Kout Mountain area of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, shot down two US aircraft and damaged three.

    On that day, US imperialism dispatched nine jet aircraft to carry out indiscriminate bombing of the Phou Kout Mountain area. The local air defense forces immediately counterattacked heroically, severely punishing the American aerial bandits.
