    The heroic deeds of Mai Xiande, the engine room mechanic of the "Sea Hero Boat," in the battle to annihilate the Chiang bandit warships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang," are truly inspiring and deeply moving! "Heroes emerge on the battlefield." Comrade Mai Xiande's performance in the battle proves that he is worthy of being a fighter of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, showing that he is a revolutionary hero.

    Even with shrapnel piercing his right frontal lobe and lodging in his left frontal lobe, he was able to persist in battle for three hours; when the shrapnel in his head had tormented him to the point of disorientation and unsteady steps, he was still able to identify a small, loosened screw among thousands of screws; although his consciousness had not fully recovered, he was able to clearly remember a soldier's mission: to be ready to eliminate invading enemies at any time. Mai Xiande's heroic deeds once again prove that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. Such people, even when seriously injured, can still be as brave as tigers, as stable as Mount Tai, as agile as swallows, and have a mind as clear as a normal person.

    After joining the army, Comrade Mai Xiande strived to arm himself with Mao Zedong Thought. In his diary, he wrote: "Chairman Mao tells us that the purpose of war is none other than to preserve ourselves and eliminate the enemy. And the purpose of war, eliminating the enemy, is the most important, while preserving ourselves is secondary. Because only by eliminating the enemy in large numbers can we effectively preserve ourselves..." "The Old Man Who Moved Mountains gave me such a great education, I will certainly...not be afraid of wind and rain, not be afraid of pain or fatigue..." Chairman Mao's thought has taken deep root in his mind and generated great power.

    Su Dongpo once wrote a "Eulogy to the Portrait of Zhuge Wuhou," saying that Zhuge Liang, when fighting, was "unstoppable in attack, unpursuable in retreat, unassailable by day, unraidable by night, invincible in numbers, unimposable upon with few." These words of praise for Zhuge Liang are more appropriate today. Revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, when fighting, are truly "unstoppable in attack, unpursuable in retreat, unassailable by day, unraidable by night, invincible in numbers, unimposable upon with few," invincible under heaven!

    最大的战斗力
    杨浦
    “海上英雄艇”的轮机兵麦贤得，在歼灭蒋匪军舰“剑门号”和“章江号”战斗中的英雄事迹，真是动人心魄，感人肺腑！“两军阵前显英雄”。麦贤得同志在战斗中的表现，证明他不愧为伟大的中国人民解放军的一个战斗员，显示出他是一个革命的英雄好汉。
    在弹片穿透了他的右额叶插到左额叶的情况下，他还能坚持战斗三小时；当脑袋里的弹片已经把他折磨得神智不清、脚步不稳的时候，他还能在千百个螺丝里检查出一只被震松了的小螺丝；虽然意识还没有完全恢复，他却能十分清醒地记住一个战士的任务：随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。麦贤得的英雄事迹，再次证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。这种人在身负重伤的情况下，依然能够勇若猛虎，稳如泰山，矫似海燕，头脑清醒象个正常的人。
    麦贤得同志在入伍以后就努力用毛泽东思想来武装自己。他在自己的日记中这样说过：“毛主席告诉我们，战争的目的不是别的，就是要保存自己，消灭敌人。而且战争的目的消灭敌人是最主要的，保存自己是第二位。因为只有大量地消灭敌人，才能有效地保存自己……”，“愚公给我一个这样大的教育，我今后一定……不怕风吹雨打，不怕痛不怕累……。”毛主席的思想在他脑海里深深地扎下了根，产生了伟大的力量。
    苏东坡曾经写过一篇《诸葛武侯画象赞》，说诸葛亮打起仗来“进不可当，退不可追，昼不可攻，夜不可袭，多不可敌，少不可欺”。这些夸奖诸葛亮的话，用在今天倒是比较合适的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，打起仗来那可真是“进不可当，退不可追，昼不可攻，夜不可袭，多不可敌，少不可欺”，无敌于天下的！
