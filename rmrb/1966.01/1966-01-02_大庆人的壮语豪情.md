    The lofty aspirations of the Daqing people:
      If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for one day, you don't have the energy to work. If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for two days, you can't overcome difficulties. If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for three days, you forget the past suffering of the class. If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a long time, you walk the wrong path with your eyes open. If you read Chairman Mao's books every day, you will forever be revolutionary and forever progress.
                  *　　　　* 
      A revolutionary should have a spirit of daring. Daring can create achievements, daring can create experience, and daring can create paths.
                 *　　　　* 
    The more difficulties, the more we must work. Working can produce wisdom, working can produce experience, working can produce solutions, working can produce heroes, working can produce miracles, and working can safeguard the country.
                 *　　　　* 
    The higher the mountain, the more promising it is; the more difficulties, the more motivation; the heavier the task, the more to work at; the deeper the well, the more to dig.
                 *　　　　* 
    A boat can only move forward by riding the wind and waves; people can only live by overcoming difficulties.
                 *　　　　* 
    Strategically despise four thousand meters – dare to fight; tactically, value one millimeter – be good at fighting.
                 *　　　　* 
    The further away from "me" by an inch, the more enthusiasm increases by one point; the further away from "me" by a foot, the enthusiasm increases infinitely. If the word "me" is completely forgotten, you dare to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire.
                 *　　　　* 
    Achievements can only explain the past, not the present, and even less the future. We must be like climbing a mountain, leaving footprints behind us, and forever moving towards the summit.
                 *　　　　* 
    Use a telescope when advancing, stand high and see far, and think of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution with all your heart. Use a magnifying glass to look at other people's achievements and learn from every bit of experience. Use a microscope to look at your own shortcomings and don't let go of minor shortcomings. Analyze problems with a condensing lens, grasp the main contradictions, and see the essence through the phenomenon.

    大庆人的壮语豪情
      一天不读毛主席的书，干起工作不起劲，两天不读毛主席的书，遇到困难顶不住，三天不读毛主席的书，忘了过去阶级苦，长久不读毛主席的书，睁着眼睛走错路，天天都读毛主席的书，永远革命永远进步。
                  *　　　　* 
      一个革命者应该有个闯劲，闯就能闯出成绩来，闯就能闯出经验来，闯就能闯出道路来。
                 *　　　　* 
    困难越多越要干。干能出智慧，干能出经验，干能出办法，干能出好汉，干能出奇迹，干能保江山。
                 *　　　　* 
    山越高越有奔头，困难越多越有闯头，任务越重越有干头，井越深越有打头。
                 *　　　　* 
    船能乘风破浪才能前进，人能克服困难才能生活。
                 *　　　　* 
    在战略上藐视四千米——敢打；在战术上又重视一毫米——善打。
                 *　　　　* 
    离“我”远一寸，干劲增一分，离“我”远一丈，干劲无限涨，
  “我”字若全忘，刀山火海都敢上。
                 *　　　　* 
    成绩只能说明过去，不能说明现在，更不能说明未来。我们要象登山一样，把脚印留在后面，永远向顶峰前进。
                 *　　　　* 
    在前进中用望远镜，站得高、看得远，一心想到中国革命和世界革命；看别人成绩用放大镜，把点滴经验学到手；看自己的缺点用显微镜，微小缺点不放过；分析问题用聚光镜，抓住主要矛盾，透过现象看本质。
