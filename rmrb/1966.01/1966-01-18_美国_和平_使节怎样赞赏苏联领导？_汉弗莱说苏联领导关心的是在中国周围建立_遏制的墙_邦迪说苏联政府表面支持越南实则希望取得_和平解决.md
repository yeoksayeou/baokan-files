    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 17th: U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey and McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, praised the Soviet Union’s new leadership on January 16 for uniting with the United States against China and indicated that the United States should further "improve" relations with the Soviet Union.
    In a nationwide television address, Humphrey emphasized the importance of his and Rusk's recent meeting with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in New Delhi. He said the meeting was "frank, straightforward, constructive," and "consistently helpful to the common cause of peace." He said, "I feel that any exchange of views among responsible government officials is helpful. This fairly lengthy conversation gave Mr. Rusk and me the opportunity to explain our government's position on several issues, and we also received responses from Mr. Kosygin."
    Humphrey said, "It is a fact that the Soviets are trying to build a wall of containment around China. Part of the reason for holding the Tashkent talks lies here. This has been done well." He said that the Soviet Union was attempting to surround China with "governments friendly to Moscow." He also said that the Soviet Union was primarily concerned with Communist China "rather than anything the United States might do."
    Humphrey said that "looking ahead to the coming years," U.S.-Soviet relations "can and should improve."
    In a televised speech the same day, Bundy also emphasized the extraordinary significance of the meeting between Humphrey, Rusk, and Kosygin. He pointed out that this meeting was the highest-level and longest-duration contact between the Soviet Union and the United States since Khrushchev's downfall, and it was an "important and beneficial discussion. The Vice President and Premier Kosygin also had some informal conversations. Such contacts are often useful."
    Regarding Shelepin's visit to Hanoi, Bundy said, "What we naturally hope is that all those who have an interest in peace in Vietnam… will emphasize to those who need to make decisions and need to react the importance of moving towards peace rather than towards more war." Bundy said that the Soviet Union's "public position is clearly one of strong support for the specific goals of the North Vietnamese government, even the conditions put forward by this government," but "for a long time we have been very clear that the Soviet government hopes to achieve a peaceful settlement there."
    Bundy went to great lengths to defend the Johnson administration's "peace offensive." He said that some critics in the United States of this "noisy diplomacy" "completely do not understand" the significance of this approach. This approach was undertaken after "the most careful consideration" and is "most helpful" in promoting the United States' goals in Vietnam.

    美国“和平”使节怎样赞赏苏联领导？
    汉弗莱说苏联领导关心的是在中国周围建立“遏制的墙”
    邦迪说苏联政府表面支持越南实则希望取得“和平解决”
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统汉弗莱和负责国家安全事务的总统特别助理麦·邦迪十六日夸奖苏联新领导联合美国、反对中国的立场，并且表示美国要进一步“改善”同苏联的关系。
    汉弗莱在向全国发表的电视讲话中，强调他和腊斯克同苏联部长会议主席柯西金最近在新德里的会谈的重要性。他说，这个会谈是“坦率的、直言无隐的、建设性的”，“对和平的共同事业始终有帮助”。他说，“我觉得政府负责官员之间任何交换意见的会谈都是有帮助的。这次时间相当长的交谈使腊斯克先生和我有机会说明我国政府在好几个问题上的立场，我们也从柯西金先生那里得到了响应。”
    汉弗莱说，“苏联人正在设法在中国周围建立一道遏制的墙，这是事实。举行塔什干会谈的部分原因就在这里。这件事干得好。”他说，苏联企图用“同莫斯科友好的政府”来包围中国。他还说，苏联主要关心的是共产党中国“而不是美国可能做的任何事情”。
    汉弗莱说，“瞻望今后几年”，美苏关系“可以而且应当改善”。
    邦迪同一天在发表电视谈话时也强调汉弗莱、腊斯克和柯西金的会谈的意义不同寻常。他指出，这次会谈是赫鲁晓夫下台以来苏美两国最高级最长时间的接触，这是一次“重要的和有益的讨论。副总统和柯西金总理还进行了一些非正式的交谈。这种联系经常是有用的。”
    谈到谢列平对河内的访问，邦迪说，“我们希望的自然是：所有对越南和平有利害关系的人……将对那些需要作出决定和需要作出反应的人强调走向和平而不是走向更多的战争的重要性。”邦迪说，苏联的“公开立场显然是大力支持北越政府的具体目标甚至这个政府提出的条件”，但是“长期以来我们一直很清楚：苏联政府是希望在那里取得和平解决的。”
    邦迪竭力为约翰逊政府的“和平攻势”辩解。他说，美国一些批评这种“喧嚣外交”的人，“完全不了解”这种做法的意义。这种做法是经过“最仔细的考虑的”，它对增进美国在越南的目标“最有帮助”。
