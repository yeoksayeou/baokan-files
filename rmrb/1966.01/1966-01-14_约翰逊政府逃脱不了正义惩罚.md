    The American aggressors are carrying out a large-scale "scorched earth" plan in South Vietnam with unprecedentedly barbaric and bloody means. Wherever the iron hooves of the American aggressors go, they burn everything, kill everything, and destroy everything, attempting to eliminate all life in vast areas. The Chinese people are filled with indignation at this monstrous crime of American imperialism! We angrily condemn this inhuman and brutal crime of the American government!

    To this day, the Johnson administration, a pack of beasts in human skin, is still clamoring that the United States has "humanitarian aspirations" towards Vietnam, that it is there to achieve "peace and freedom," and that it is to allow the Vietnamese to "live a better life." They vainly attempt to disguise themselves as seeking "peace" by "suspending bombing." But all these deceptive tricks cannot cover the bloodied hands of the American aggressors and cannot deceive the eyes of the people of the world.

    On the soil of South Vietnam, what are nearly 200,000 American aggressors doing every day?

    They drop thousands of tons of bombs and incendiary bombs, turning village after village into rubble.

    They massacre the Vietnamese people on a large scale, beheading, disemboweling, ripping out hearts, dismembering, and sparing not even women and children.

    They use poison gas and chemical toxins in large quantities, poisoning tens of thousands of people and destroying millions of acres of fertile land.

    They blatantly implement a large-scale "scorched earth" plan, openly proclaiming to "round up" "everyone they can find," "burn and destroy" "all edible things," and "burn down all the houses they see."

    The crimes committed by the American aggressors in South Vietnam far exceed what the Hitler fascist bandits and Japanese militarists did in their time. The Japanese invaders implemented a "Three Alls" policy in China, and German fascists established "death camps" in Europe. Today, American imperialism uses the most modern killing weapons in South Vietnam and uses poison gas and chemical toxins that the German and Japanese fascists dared not use openly. In the past few years, the American aggressors and their running dogs have slaughtered, harmed, and detained more than 1.4 million people in a place with a population of only 14 million. Their barbarity has reached its extreme.

    Hitler once hoped to destroy the will to resist of the invaded with a "war of terror." He said, "The most important thing is to suddenly frighten others with an irresistible terror of death." However, the people cannot be intimidated. The result of the fascist gang's contest with the people of various countries was not that the people were conquered, but that the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists suffered complete defeat.

    As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The intention of all reactionaries is to eliminate the revolution by means of massacre. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will become. But contrary to this reactionary wishful thinking, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary forces become, and the closer the reactionaries are to their demise. This is an irresistible law." Today, Johnson will certainly not escape the fate of Hitler and Tojo Hideki.

    Faced with the American aggressors intensifying and expanding the war of aggression in South Vietnam, how can anyone with a sense of justice, anyone who loves peace, not hate them with gnashing teeth? How can they stand by and watch the American aggressors kill and set fires with impunity? How can they not redouble their support for the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people? In this situation, if a socialist country is indifferent and still colluding with American imperialism, promoting the "peace talks" swindle for the Johnson administration, then they do not even have the most basic sense of justice, let alone "aid" to the Vietnamese people!

    The statements issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 9 and 11, and the statement issued by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency on January 12, successively strongly protested the American imperialism's frantic intensification of the war of aggression against South Vietnam, condemned the American aggressors' implementation of the extremely barbaric "Three Alls" policy in South Vietnam, and solemnly declared that no brutal action, no modern weapon, no vicious means can save American imperialism and its running dogs from failure in the South; the Vietnamese people firmly believe in their unity and are determined to carry out the war of resistance against America for national salvation to the final victory.

    The Chinese people share the feelings of the Vietnamese people. We fully understand the determination of the Vietnamese people to persist in the war of resistance against America for national salvation until the final victory. When the South Vietnamese people continue to suffer such brutal massacres by American imperialism, how can they lay down their weapons and stop fighting? The people of the North have every right to support their flesh-and-blood brothers and sisters and resolutely fight to the end for the liberation of the South, the defense of the North, and the reunification of the motherland.

    The Chinese people firmly support the statements issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 9 and 11, and support the statement issued by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency on January 12, the official mouthpiece of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. We once again call on all peace-loving countries and people in the world to take immediate action, resolutely stop the fascist atrocities of American imperialism, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors.

    Blood debts must be repaid. The Johnson administration will absolutely not escape just punishment.

### 约翰逊政府逃脱不了正义惩罚

    约翰逊政府逃脱不了正义惩罚
    美国侵略军以空前野蛮的血腥手段，疯狂地在越南南方推行大规模的“焦土”计划。美国侵略军铁蹄所至，烧光，杀光，毁光，企图消灭广大地区内的一切生命。对于美帝国主义的这种滔天罪行，中国人民义愤填膺！我们愤怒谴责美国政府这种灭绝人性的残暴罪行！
    直到今天，约翰逊政府这一伙披着人皮的野兽，还在喧嚷什么美国对越南怀有“人道主义的愿望”，是为了在那里实现“和平和自由”，是为了让越南人“能过更好的生活”。它们妄想以“暂停轰炸”来把自己装扮成是在谋求“和平”的。但是，所有这一切欺骗手法，都掩盖不了美国侵略者的血手，蒙蔽不了世界人民的眼睛。
    在越南南方的土地上，将近二十万美国侵略军，天天在干些什么呢？
    它们扔下成千上万吨的炸弹和燃烧弹，把一个又一个的村庄夷为平地。
    它们大规模地残杀越南人民，砍头、剖腹、挖心、肢解，连妇女儿童也不放过。
    它们大量使用毒气和化学毒剂，毒害成千上万的人民，毁坏千百万亩良田。
    它们明目张胆地推行大规模的“焦土”计划，公开宣扬要“兜捕”它们“能够找到的所有的人”，“把能吃的东西”“全部烧掉毁掉”，“把看见的所有的房子通通烧光”。
    美国侵略者在南越犯下的罪行，远远超过了当年希特勒法西斯匪徒和日本军国主义者所干过的。日本侵略者在中国推行过“三光”政策，德国法西斯在欧洲建立过“死亡营”。而今美帝国主义在南越使用了最现代化的杀人武器，使用了德日法西斯不敢公开使用的毒气和化学毒药。几年来，美国侵略者和它的走狗，在一个只有一千四百万人口的地方，已经屠杀、残害和拘禁了一百四十多万人。其野蛮程度，达于极点。
    希特勒曾经指望以“恐怖的战争”来摧毁被侵略者的抵抗意志。他说，“最最重要的就是突然拿一种无可抗拒的死的恐怖去吓倒别人。”但是，人民是吓不倒的。法西斯匪帮同各国人民较量的结果，不是人民被征服了，而是德日意法西斯遭到彻底失败。
    正如毛泽东同志指出的：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”今天，约翰逊也决逃脱不了希特勒和东条英机的命运。
    面对着美国侵略者变本加厉地在越南南方扩大侵略战争，一切有正义感的人，一切爱好和平的人，怎么能不切齿痛恨？怎么能眼睁睁看着美国侵略者肆无忌惮地杀人放火？怎么能不百倍加强对南越人民正义斗争的支援？在这种情况下，如果作为一个社会主义国家竟无动于衷，还在同美帝国主义勾勾搭搭，为约翰逊政府推销“和谈”骗局，那么，他们连最起码的正义感都没有了，还谈得上什么“援助”越南人民！
    越南民主共和国外交部一月九日和十一日发表的声明，越南南方解放通讯社一月十二日发表的声明，先后强烈抗议美帝国主义疯狂强化侵略越南南方战争，谴责美国侵略军在南越推行极端野蛮的“三光”政策，并且庄严地声明，任何一种残暴的行动，任何一种现代化武器，任何一种恶毒手段，都挽救不了美帝国主义及其走狗在南方的失败；越南人民坚信自己的团结力量，决心把抗美救国的抗战进行到最后胜利。
    中国人民对越南人民的处境感同身受。我们完全理解越南人民坚持抗美救国斗争直到最后胜利的决心。当越南南方人民继续遭受着美帝国主义如此残暴的屠杀的时候，他们怎么能够放下武器、停止斗争呢？北方人民完全有权利支持自己的骨肉兄弟，为解放南方、保卫北方、争取祖国统一而坚决打到底。
    中国人民坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部一月九日和十一日的声明，支持越南南方民族解放阵线的正式发言机构——越南南方解放通讯社一月十二日的声明。我们再一次呼吁全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，立即行动起来，坚决制止美帝国主义的法西斯暴行，坚决支持越南人民打败美国侵略者。
    血债必须偿还。约翰逊政府绝对逃脱不了正义的惩罚。
