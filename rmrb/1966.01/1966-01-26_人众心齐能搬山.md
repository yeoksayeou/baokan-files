    United Hearts Can Move Mountains
    Wang Linhe, Worker-Engineer, Shanghai Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory
    On New Year's Day, I boarded the Beijing-Shanghai train to deliver a new product – a type of electrical measuring instrument – that our Shanghai Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory had trial-produced just before New Year's Day, to the capital. Inside the carriage, people were listening to the radio, reading newspapers, and discussing the Third Five-Year Plan. The entire carriage was filled with enthusiasm. This fervent atmosphere couldn't help but remind me of many things.
    Last spring, after graduating from Shanghai University of Science and Technology, I returned to the factory to participate in the trial production of this new product. During the trial production process, we not only received strong assistance from eleven related units across the country, including Harbin Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, and the Electrical Engineering Research Institute, but also support from various sectors of society.
    One day, I went to the Shanghai Library to borrow a foreign electrical engineering document. A female comrade looked at the English document title I had filled out on the card and said, "Oh! This is a 'niche' document!"
    "Yes," I said, "Our factory is trial-producing a new product with the level of the 1960s, and we need this 'niche' document for reference."
    "Then, we must find it as quickly as possible!" The female comrade quickly turned and went into the stacks.
    After a while, she came out and said, "We have searched through the relevant book catalogs, but we haven't found it." Just as I was about to leave, the female comrade said, "Please wait a moment! We have already made a long-distance call to Beijing to check."
    Not long after, the female comrade, with a smile on her face, handed me a document and asked me, "Is this it?"
    I looked at it, "Yes! That's it, exactly. Thank you! Thank you!"
    "You wrote two words incorrectly in the English name of this document. The Beijing Library repeatedly checked and corrected two words for you, telegraphed back to us, and we were then able to find this 'niche' document."
    Hearing her say this, I was moved, and I just tightly grasped her hand, saying, "We've caused you trouble!"
    "Serving the people! If we can contribute to your path of climbing the peaks of science and technology, and help you remove even a small obstacle, we are willing to endure even ten thousand times the trouble." The female comrade's words were very calm, but I seemed to hear a sound – the sound of a red heart beating, a library worker serving the effort to catch up with the world's advanced level!
    During the trial production process, we borrowed many foreign language documents from various sources in this way. However, my own foreign language proficiency was limited, and coupled with the urgent time constraints, I had to ask the relevant translation departments to help translate some of them into Chinese. One day, I brought a thick stack of documents. The comrade who received me, hearing that they were urgently needed, asked with concern, "When do you need them?"
    "Ideally, within a week."
    This comrade went in to discuss it and came out smiling, saying, "Okay, you go back, and come back to pick them up in a week."
    On the sixth day, I received a phone call saying that all the documents had been translated. When I got there, I saw several old comrades with gray hair and red eyes. I asked, and learned that they had been working early and late every day, cooperating fully, to get them translated in time. At this time, I uneasily said, "You've worked hard, I'm really sorry."
    "It's for the revolution! Only by working hard can we taste the sweetness! Haha."
    The old comrades' laughter resonated in my heart, and the old comrades' red hearts, serving the effort to catch up with the world's advanced level, were pressed against my heart.
    We received these documents, and then designed and trial-produced at the same time. The new product used entirely domestically produced materials. One important component required cutting a new type of alloy material into narrow alloy strips, with the width of the entire length of the strip having an error of no more than two threads (approximately two-sevenths of the thickness of a hair). But we didn't have this kind of cutting equipment, what should we do?
    One day, I was walking down the street when a large truck drove past me. Looking up, I saw it was filled with strips of narrow steel. Hey! Steel strips can be cut from a rolling mill, could we ask a steel strip factory to think of a way to cut these alloy strips? Coincidentally, there was a Shanghai Cold Rolled Steel Strip Factory nearby, so I went to contact them. This steel strip factory had never done this kind of work before, but the factory leaders were very enthusiastic. They agreed to immediately assign experienced workers and technicians, and also to allocate their best rolling mill to help process the alloy.
    The rolling mill started up. The first alloy strip that was cut did not meet the quality requirements. They studied the reasons, adjusted the cutting tools, and tried again, but it still didn't work.
    The steel strip factory had a busy production schedule, and I apologetically said to them, "This will affect your production."
    "It's all for socialist construction. This process is not only key for you, but also key for us. We must overcome this challenge!" They answered with full confidence in the face of difficulties.
    Not many days later, comrades from the steel strip factory notified me: it was all cut! I went straight from the factory to the steel strip factory, and saw strips of shimmering silver alloy lying on the ground. The tail of the last strip had just fallen from the rolling mill. The experienced workers and technicians had their hands covered in grease and their faces were sweating. I excitedly ran over and tightly grasped their hands. Their spirit of cooperation encouraged my confidence in overcoming difficulties.
    After overcoming the difficulty of cutting the alloy strips, we encountered new difficulties: the alloy strips also needed to undergo high-temperature heat treatment. At this time, many fraternal units extended a helping hand. Through their introductions, we learned that a factory in Shanghai had this kind of equipment in its central laboratory. Several comrades from the factory and I took the alloy strips and went to seek help. The leaders of this factory immediately assigned the task to a Communist Youth League group. This group of energetic young people accepted this new task with fiery enthusiasm. We asked, "Are there any difficulties?" They firmly replied, "We use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, and we can overcome any difficulty, no matter how great!"
    This was a high-precision alloy heat treatment, something these young people had never done before, but they were truly a group of little tigers. They worked day and night in shifts, fought for a week, conducted thirty-nine sample tests, obtained a large amount of scientific data, and finally developed a new process for heat treating alloy strips, helping us solve a major problem. This was another truly great victory!
    When I came to this laboratory to express my thanks and congratulations to the young people, they smiled and said, "Difficulties can forge people!"
    Yes, the fiery hearts of these young people are becoming redder and redder in the revolutionary furnace.
    There are many stories that occurred during this great collaboration, and here, I have only talked about a few of them. But from these stories, I have received a profound education. As the saying goes: United hearts can move mountains. With our 650 million Chinese people, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, what difficulties cannot be overcome? What peaks cannot be climbed? Chairman Mao said: "The people have unlimited creative power. They can organize themselves and march towards all places and departments where they can exert their strength, march towards the depth and breadth of production, and create ever-increasing welfare undertakings for themselves." This new product of ours is precisely trial-produced by the people, organized under the leadership of the Party, and displaying the communist style of great collaboration!
    The whistle blew long, and the train entered Beijing Station. I brought this new product, no, I brought not only a new product, but also the red hearts of many units and countless library staff, translation staff, young experimental personnel, and worker comrades, to the capital.
    The capital, the people's capital! Here, the bugle call to march towards the Third Five-Year Plan has sounded. The sound of this bugle call has spread to all corners of the motherland, and into the hearts of 650 million people. Haven't all the comrades who participated in the trial production of this new product already taken practical actions to advance by leaps and bounds following this bugle call? I believe that we will certainly be able to continuously overcome the difficulties on the road ahead and climb one new peak after another in the world's science and technology! (Attached image)

    人众心齐能搬山
    上海沪光科学仪器厂工人工程师　王林鹤
    元旦这一天，我乘上京沪列车，把我们上海沪光科学仪器厂在元旦前夕试制出的一项新产品——一种电工测量仪器，送到首都去。车厢里，人们在听着广播，在看着报纸，在谈论着第三个五年计划，整个车厢显得一片热气腾腾。这种热烈的情绪，不禁使我想起了很多事情。
    去年春天，我从上海科技大学毕业后，就回到厂里参加这一项新产品的试制工作。在试制过程中，不但得到哈尔滨工业大学、清华大学、电工研究所等全国十一个有关单位的大力协助，而且得到社会上各方面力量的支援。
    一天，我到上海图书馆去借一份外文电工资料。一位女同志看了我在卡片上填写的英文资料名称，就说：“唷！这是一份‘冷门’资料呀！”
    “是的。”我说，“我们厂要试制一项具有六十年代水平的新产品，需要这‘冷门’资料作参考。”
    “那，我们一定尽快找出来！”女同志飞快地转进书库里去了。
    一会儿，她出来说：“我们找遍了有关的图书目录，都没有查到。”我刚要走，女同志又说：“请等一等！我们已经打长途电话到北京去查了。”
    没多一会，女同志脸上挂着笑容，递给我一份资料，问我：“是不是这个？”
    我一看，“对！就是这个，一点不错。谢谢！谢谢！”
    “你把这资料的英文名称写错了两个字，北京图书馆反复查核，给你校正了两个字，回电给我们，我们才找到这份‘冷门’资料。”
    听她这么一说，我心里激动，只是紧紧地握住她的手，说：“给你们增加麻烦了！”
    “为人民服务嘛！如果我们能在你们攀登科学技术高峰的道路上出一把力，帮你们扫除一分障碍，即是有万分的麻烦也心甘情愿。”女同志的话说得非常平静，可我仿佛听到一种声音——图书馆工作人员为赶超世界先进水平服务的一颗红心跳动的声音！
    在试制过程中，就这样，我们从各方面借到许多外文资料。可是，我自己的外文水平有限，加上时间紧迫，只得将其中的一部分请有关翻译部门帮助翻译成中文。一天，我带着一叠厚厚的资料跑去。接待我的同志听说是急用的，关切地问：“你希望那一天要呢？”
    “最好在一个星期之内。”
    这位同志进去商量了一下，就笑嘻嘻地出来说：“好，你回去吧，过一个星期来拿。”
    到了第六天，我接到电话，说这些资料全部翻译好了。我到了那里，看到好几位头发花白的老同志眼睛红红的，一问，才知道他们为了赶时间，每天起早落夜，通力合作，才翻译出来。这时，我不安地说：“辛苦你们了，真对不起。”
    “为革命嘛！辛苦点才能尝到甜头哩！哈哈。”
    老同志们的笑声在我心里激荡，老同志们为赶超世界先进水平服务的一颗红心贴在我的心坎上。
    我们得到了这些资料，就边设计、边试制。新产品使用的全部是国产材料。其中一个重要的元件，需要将一种新型的合金材料裁成狭长的合金带，带子全长的宽度，误差不能超过两丝（约等于一根头发丝的七分之二）。可是我们没有这种剪裁的设备，怎么办？
    一天，我走在路上，一辆大卡车从我身边开过去，抬头一看，上面装满了一条条狭长的带钢。哎！带钢可以从轧机上裁剪开来，这裁剪合金带是不是也可以请带钢厂想想办法呢？恰巧附近有家上海冷轧带钢厂，我就跑去联系。这家带钢厂过去没有做过这种活，但厂里的领导非常热情，他们答应马上配备老师傅和技术员，并且抽出一台最好的轧机来帮助加工。
    轧机开动起来了。剪出来的第一根合金带不符合质量要求。他们研究了原因，调整了刀具，再试，还是不行。
    带钢厂的生产任务很忙，我抱歉地对他们说：“要影响你们的生产了。”
    “都是为了社会主义建设。这道工序既是你们的关键，也就是我们的关键，一定要把它攻下来！”他们在困难面前满怀信心地回答。
    没过几天，带钢厂同志通知我：已经全部裁好了！我从厂里直奔带钢厂，只见一条条银光闪闪的合金带躺在地上，那最后一根的尾巴，刚从轧机上落下来。老师傅和技术员的手上沾满了车油，脸上流着汗水。我兴奋地跑了过去，紧紧地握住他们的手。他们的协作精神，鼓舞了我克服困难的信心。
    冲过了裁剪合金带的难关，我们又碰到了新的困难：合金带还需要经过高温热处理。这时，好多兄弟单位伸出了援助的手。通过他们的辗转介绍，使我们知道上海有一家工厂的中心试验室有这种设备。我和厂里的几个同志就带着合金带登门求助，这家厂的领导马上就把任务交给一个共青团小组。这群朝气蓬勃的年青人，以火样的热情接受了这个新任务。我们问：“有困难吗？”他们坚定地回答：“我们用毛主席思想武装头脑，有天大的困难也能克服！”
    这是一种高精度合金热处理，这些青年人从来没有干过，可是他们真是一群小老虎，日夜轮番作战，奋战一星期，作了三十九次样品试验，得出大量的科学数据，终于摸索出一套合金带热处理的新工艺，帮助我们解决了大问题。这是又一个多么巨大的胜利！
    当我来到这个试验室，向青年们表示感谢和祝贺的时候，他们笑了一笑，说：“困难可以炼人！”
    是的，年青人的一颗颗火热的心，在革命的熔炉里愈炼愈红了。
    在大协作中发生的故事很多，这里，我只是谈了其中的几个。但从这些故事中，我受到深刻的教育。有言道：人众心齐能搬山。我们六亿五千万中国人民，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，有什么困难不能克服？有什么高峰不能攀登？毛主席这样说过：“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”我们这项新产品正是人民群众在党领导下，组织起来发挥大协作的共产主义风格而试制出来的！
    汽笛长鸣，列车进入北京站了。我带着这项新产品，不，我带的不单是新产品，而是好多单位和无数图书资料工作人员、翻译工作人员、青年试验人员、工人同志的红心来到首都的。
    首都，人民的首都！这里吹起了向第三个五年计划进军的号角，这号角的声音吹到了祖国的四面八方，吹到了六亿五千万人民的心里。我们所有参加这项新产品试制工作的同志，不是已经用实际行动跟着这号声大踏步地前进了吗？我相信，我们一定能不断克服前进道上的困难，攀登上世界科学技术一个又一个新的高峰！（附图片）
