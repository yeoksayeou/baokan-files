    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi dispatch: Vietnam News Agency reports: The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 6th, strongly condemning before world public opinion the brutal massacre of 50 innocent civilians and the destruction of Xinjiang Village, Sui Fuxian County, Pingding Province, by the South Korean puppet troops, who are accomplices of the U.S. aggressors, on December 22 last year.
    The statement emphasized, "The above-mentioned bloody atrocity occurred precisely when the U.S. authorities were clamoring for so-called 'seeking peace in Vietnam.' This once again exposes the extremely brutal and aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in South Vietnam."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 12: South Vietnam Liberation Radio recently published a commentary, strongly condemning the bloody crime of the South Korean puppet troops, who are accomplices of the U.S. aggressors, in brutally massacring 50 innocent civilians in Xinjiang Village, Pingding Province, South Vietnam.
    The commentary said that the South Vietnamese people must repay this blood debt a thousandfold!
    The commentary pointed out that in the Xinjiang Village massacre, the South Korean puppet troops also wantonly murdered the families of puppet soldiers. This incident nakedly exposed the traitorous and harmful nature of the Saigon puppet regime, which leads wolves into the house. They are not satisfied with selling the flesh and blood of soldiers, but also welcome the invaders to massacre their families. This incident aroused high indignation among puppet soldiers.
    This newspaper reports: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on the morning of December 22 last year, the U.S. aggressors continuously fired more than 500 shells at Xinjiang Village, Fuhe Township, Sui Fuxian County, Pingding Province, South Vietnam, and ordered two companies of South Korean accomplice troops to carry out an inhuman "mopping-up" campaign of "destroying all, killing all" in the village. Under the command of the U.S. aggressors, the South Korean accomplice troops brutally murdered more than 50 people in the village on the spot, including 22 young children under the age of twelve, 22 women (including three pregnant women), and six old men aged seventy or eighty. A two-year-old child was grabbed by the neck and lifted high, his head was slammed against a tree root, and then he was thrown into a burning house. Another twelve-year-old girl was shot and had her leg broken before being buried alive. Many families, such as the Kui Da Niang family of seven, the Qi Da Niang family of nine, and the Ruan Shi You family of four, were all killed by these robbers.
    U.S. imperialism not only instructed the South Korean accomplice troops to frantically massacre innocent women, the elderly, and children, but even carried out massacres against some families whose children were serving in the puppet army and puppet regime. For example, Wu Shi Dan Da Niang, Ruan Shi Bei Da Niang, and Ruan Kang Lao Da Ye, whose sons served in the puppet army, puppet security forces, and puppet regime, were all killed. In addition, these South Korean accomplice troops also brutally tortured and arrested nineteen people from Xinjiang Village, including seven young children.
    The barbaric atrocities of the U.S. aggressors and South Korean accomplice troops aroused the incomparable hatred and anger of the local people and the people of South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam are turning grief into strength, determined to eliminate more invaders and avenge their compatriots who were brutally murdered.

    越南外交部谴责美帝驱使南朝鲜仆从军屠杀南越人民
    美帝任何野蛮恐怖暴行也挽救不了败局
    南越解放电台说南越人民一定要敌人千百倍地偿还血债
    据新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道：越南民主共和国外交部发言人六日发表声明，向世界舆论强烈谴责充当美国侵略者帮凶的南朝鲜仆从军去年十二月二十二日在平定省绥福县新江村野蛮屠杀五十名无辜平民和毁掉这个村子的暴行。
    声明强调说，“上述血腥暴行正是在美国当局叫嚷所谓
  ‘谋求越南和平’的时候发生的，这再次暴露了美帝国主义及其在越南南方的走狗的极端残暴的侵略本性。”
    据新华社河内十二日电越南南方解放电台最近发表评论，强烈谴责充当美国侵略者帮凶的南朝鲜仆从军野蛮屠杀越南南方平定省新江村无辜平民五十人的血腥罪行。
    评论说，南越人民一定要敌人千百倍地偿还这笔血债。
    评论指出，在新江村的惨案中，南朝鲜仆从军还肆意残杀了伪军家属。这一事件赤裸裸地暴露了引狼入室的西贡伪政权叛国害民的面目。它们不满足于出卖士兵的血肉，还要把侵略者迎进来残杀他们的家属。这一事件在伪军士兵中激起了高度的愤慨。
    本报讯　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美国侵略者于去年十二月二十二日清晨向南越平定省绥福县福和乡新江村连续发射五百多发炮弹，并下令两连南朝鲜帮凶军对该村进行了“毁光、杀光”的惨无人道的“扫荡”。在美国侵略者指挥下的南朝鲜帮凶军，当场就在该村惨杀了五十多人，其中包括十二岁以下的幼童二十二人，妇女二十二人（其中有三位孕妇），以及六个年已七、八十岁的老大爷。一个两岁的孩子被他们卡着脖子高高地提起来，把他的头往树根猛撞，然后再把他扔进一间正在熊熊燃烧的房屋里。另一个十二岁的女孩子在被他们开枪打断腿后又被活埋。有许多家庭，例如魁大娘全家七口、七大娘全家九口、阮氏友全家四口，都被这些强盗杀光。
    美帝国主义不仅指使南朝鲜帮凶军疯狂地残杀无辜的妇女、老人和儿童，而且甚至对一些有子弟在伪军和伪政权中服役的家庭也进行了屠杀。例如有儿子在伪军、伪保安队和伪政权中服役的武氏澹大娘、阮氏杯大娘和阮康老大爷等都被杀害。除此之外，这些南朝鲜帮凶军还野蛮地拷打和抓走了新江村的十九个人，其中有七个年幼的孩子。
    美国侵略者和南朝鲜帮凶军的野蛮暴行，激起了当地人民和南越各地人民的无比仇恨和愤怒。南越各地人民正在化悲愤为力量，决心消灭更多侵略者，为惨遭杀害的同胞报仇。
