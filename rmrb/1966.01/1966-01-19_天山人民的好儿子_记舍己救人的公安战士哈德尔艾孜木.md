    Good Son of the People of Tianshan

    —In Memory of the Public Security Warrior Haděr Àiyīzīmù Who Sacrificed Himself to Save Others

    Good soldier of Chairman Mao, good son of the Uyghur people, and outstanding Communist Party member—Haděr Àiyīzīmù, the captain of the Public Security Team of Bachu County, Xinjiang, gloriously sacrificed himself in a flood while rescuing the people. His heroic deeds of not fearing hardship or death, stepping forward in the face of threats to the people's interests, and sacrificing himself for others, have spread throughout the north and south of Tianshan and throughout the People's Public Security Forces.

  Fighting the Whirlpool, Sacrificing Himself to Save Others

    On July 26th of last year, southern Xinjiang experienced several days of torrential rain. Countless rushing rivers, like wild horses freed from their reins, roared and raged, seriously threatening the safety of the people's lives and property.

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù, the captain of the Public Security Team of Bachu County, upon hearing the emergency mobilization on the radio, disregarded his recurring stomach illness and immediately led a rescue team of seventeen soldiers to join the masses in the fight against the flood.

    At approximately 10:00 AM, Abùlì Mǐtí Wújiā Āpízī, a Uyghur intellectual youth participating in the rescue, was carelessly swept into a whirlpool by the rapids. At this critical moment, Haděr Àiyīzīmù stepped forward bravely, plunging into the flood and rushing towards Abùlì Mǐtí Wújiā Āpízī with all his might. He pushed through several waves in succession, grabbing Abùlì Mǐtí Wújiā Āpízī's right arm and lifting him upwards. Just as Abùlì Mǐtí Wújiā Āpízī's head emerged from the water, a series of waves crashed down from behind them, scattering them. Abùlì Mǐtí Wújiā Āpízī was again swept underwater by the whirlpool.

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù paddled forcefully several times, calmly searching in the water. When Abùlì Mǐtí Wújiā Āpízī reappeared on the surface with the rolling torrent, Haděr Àiyīzīmù alertly followed the current, pushing him forcefully out of the whirlpool with a palm, and then pushed a wooden stake towards him. With the assistance of the soldier Xǔ Píngchāng, he was rescued ashore.

    At this point, Haděr Àiyīzīmù, having struggled with the flood for a long time, was utterly exhausted. Five-Good Soldier Dǎng Zhōngxiào and three local primary school teachers successively jumped into the water to rescue the captain. Although in a perilous situation, Haděr Àiyīzīmù was extremely concerned about the safety of the comrades who came to rescue him, and he shouted with all his might: "It's too dangerous here, hurry back…" Before he could finish speaking, a rapid wave struck, knocking teacher Nàmǎití Āmǎn unconscious. Disregarding his own perilous situation, Haděr Àiyīzīmù exerted all his strength, paddling forward one meter against the waves, grabbed a wooden stake floating on the surface, and pushed it hard towards Nàmǎití Āmǎn. Nàmǎití Āmǎn grabbed the wooden stake and finally averted danger, but Comrade Haděr Àiyīzīmù was swallowed by the ferocious torrent…

    Remembering Class Hatred, Wholeheartedly Serving the People

    Three generations of Haděr Àiyīzīmù's family had been treated like beasts of burden by landlords. The whole family could not make a living, so his eldest brother kneaded leather in the landlord's house, his third brother worked as an apprentice in a workshop, and the seven-year-old Haděr Àiyīzīmù wandered everywhere with his father. One day, he was so hungry that he picked up a rotten peach from the ground to eat, but was viciously whipped by the landlord, leaving three deep scars on Haděr Àiyīzīmù's back. There was also a mark of humiliation below his right ear. This was left when the landlord's son held him down on the ground and rode him like a horse, whipping him with a rattan cane. At the age of twelve, Haděr Àiyīzīmù worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. The ruthless landlord, in order to extort this poor child, insisted that he had stolen a leather overcoat. Thus, Haděr Àiyīzīmù worked for the landlord for a year and a half for nothing and was also beaten.

    This class hatred was forever etched in Haděr Àiyīzīmù's young heart.

    In 1949, Xinjiang was liberated, and Haděr Àiyīzīmù's family turned over and became masters of the country. He thanked the savior Communist Party and his benefactor Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart. In 1950, carrying the three scars on his back, he joined the People's Army.

    In the army, he actively participated in the rent reduction and anti-hegemony struggle, denouncing the towering crimes of the landlord class together with the poor peasants. In 1952, he led a squad to perform duties 150 li away from the team headquarters. This was the Gobi Desert, sparsely populated, with sandstorms filling the sky. Under the circumstances of few people, heavy tasks, and poor conditions, he and his comrades stood guard and checked sentry posts day and night, successfully completing their tasks. In 1954, Haděr Àiyīzīmù was transferred to a duty point on the Pamir Plateau. Here, the climate was cold and changeable, but he was not afraid of hardship and always held his post.

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù never forgot the class struggle and always stood on the front line of the class struggle. When the Indian reactionaries launched a large-scale armed invasion against our border, he wrote ten applications in succession, resolutely requesting to go to the front lines to participate in the self-defense counterattack. After his death, an application requesting support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression was also found in his pocket.

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù put the interests of the Party and the country first, and disregarded his personal safety. Once, when the food company caught fire, he fearlessly jumped from the roof into the warehouse, fighting the raging fire and rescuing state property. When the suburban canal breached, he did not fear the severe cold and ice, jumping into the biting water to drive piles and plug the gap. When he came ashore, his whole body was frozen blue, but he didn't care at all.

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù was filled with deep class feelings for the people. There was an old poor peasant, Pàtímù Hàn, over seventy years old living near the garrison. Old and weak, without sons or daughters, Haděr Àiyīzīmù took care of her as if she were his own mother. The old woman was very moved and personally went to the team to express her gratitude. When he heard that Kucha area had suffered a major flood, he immediately donated more than 150 yuan he had saved and a set of cotton and single clothing to the people in the disaster area.

      Growing Up Under the Spring Breeze and Rain

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù was a communist fighter who grew up nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. In 1960, the Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued the call to "Be sure to master Mao Zedong Thought," and he responded enthusiastically, studying with the thirst of one starving. He wrote in his diary: "I feel that Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and I must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all my actions."

    He studied Chairman Mao's works, was good at linking theory with practice, studied and applied it creatively, and constantly transformed his thinking. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he wrote: "What kind of person do I want to be? A person who is forever loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and willing to make any sacrifice for the Party and the people." After studying "Serve the People," he wanted to be a soldier like Sīmǎyì Mǎimǎití, the combat hero in the self-defense counterattack on the Sino-Indian border. After reading "On the Chongqing Negotiations," he was determined to always be a servant of the people.

    Haděr Àiyīzīmù not only seriously studied Chairman Mao's works himself and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, but also cared about everyone's studies and used Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the soldiers. As soon as new soldiers enlisted, he would buy separate editions of Chairman Mao's works and give them to them.

    In his usual work, Haděr Àiyīzīmù always chose the heaviest burdens to bear, setting an example for the soldiers.

    After Haděr Àiyīzīmù's sacrifice, in order to commend his noble qualities of sacrificing himself for others and wholeheartedly serving the people, the leaders of the Public Security Forces posthumously awarded him first-class merit, and the Public Security Forces Party Committee and the Xinjiang Military Region Party Committee made a decision calling on all commanders and fighters to learn from him.

    天山人民的好儿子
    ——记舍己救人的公安战士哈德尔艾孜木
    毛主席的好战士、维吾尔族人民的好儿子、优秀的共产党员——新疆巴楚县公安队队长哈德尔艾孜木，在一次洪水中，为抢救人民群众光荣牺牲了。他那一不怕苦，二不怕死，在人民利益受到威胁的时刻，挺身而出，舍己为人的英雄事迹，传遍了天山南北，传遍了人民公安部队。
  奋战漩涡舍己救人
    去年七月二十六日，新疆南部连续下了几天暴雨，无数条湍急的河水，象脱缰的野马，奔腾咆哮，严重地威胁着人民生命财产的安全。
    巴楚县公安队队长哈德尔艾孜木，从广播里听到紧急动员，不顾正在发作的胃病，立即带领由十七名战士组成的抢险队，与群众一起投入抗洪战斗。
    上午十时许，参加抢险的维吾尔族知识青年阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜不慎被激流卷进漩涡。在这危急时刻，哈德尔艾孜木挺身而出，纵身跳入洪水，全力扑向阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜。他接连冲过几个浪头，一把抓住了阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜的右臂，乘势往上一提。阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜的头刚露出水面，一串激浪从他俩背后劈头盖脑地压下来，把他俩打散。阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜又被漩涡卷入水底。
    哈德尔艾孜木猛划几下，镇静地在水里寻找着。当阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜随着翻滚的洪流露出水面时，哈德尔艾孜木机警地随着水势猛推一掌，把阿不力米提吾加阿皮孜推出漩涡，又把一根木桩推给他，在战士许平昌的帮助下，把他救上了岸。
    这时，长时间与洪水搏斗的哈德尔艾孜木已精疲力竭。五好战士党忠孝和当地三个小学教员相继跳入水中，营救队长脱险。哈德尔艾孜木处于危急之中，却十分关心前来营救他的同志的安危，他用力喊道：“这里太危险，你们赶快回去……”话音未落，一个急浪打来，把教员那买提阿满打昏了。哈德尔艾孜木不顾个人置身险境，拼尽全力，迎着浪头向前猛划一米，抓住一根漂在水面的木桩，向那买提阿满使劲推去。那买提阿满抓住了木桩，终于化险为安，可是哈德尔艾孜木同志却被凶恶的激流吞没……。
    牢记阶级仇一心为人民
    哈德尔艾孜木一家三代，都给地主当牛马。全家无法生活，大兄就在地主家揉皮子，三兄到作坊当徒工，七岁的哈德尔艾孜木跟着父亲到处流浪。一天，他实在饿得不行，拣了地下的烂桃吃，被地主用皮鞭毒打一顿，在哈德尔艾孜木的背上，留下了三条深深的鞭痕。他的右耳下还有一块被侮辱的印记。这是地主儿子把他按在地上当马骑，用藤条抽打留下的。哈德尔艾孜木十二岁就给地主当长工，狠心的地主为了勒索这个苦孩子，硬说他偷了一件皮大衣。这样，哈德尔艾孜木白白给地主干了一年半，还遭了一顿毒打。
    这阶级的仇恨永远刻在哈德尔艾孜木幼小的心灵上。
    一九四九年新疆解放了，哈德尔艾孜木一家翻身做了国家的主人。他从心里感谢救星共产党，感谢恩人毛主席。一九五○年，他带着背上的三条伤痕，参加了人民军队。
    在部队里，他积极参加减租减息的反霸斗争，和贫苦农民一起控诉地主阶级的滔天罪行。一九五二年，他带领一个班，在远离队部一百五十里的地方执勤。这里是戈壁滩，人烟稀少，风沙弥天，在人少、任务重、条件差的情况下，他不分昼夜地和同志们一起站岗查哨，胜利地完成了任务。一九五四年，哈德尔艾孜木被调到帕米尔高原的执勤点执勤。在这里，气候严寒、多变，他不怕艰苦，始终坚守岗位。
    哈德尔艾孜木时刻不忘阶级斗争，一直站在阶级斗争的最前线。当印度反动派向我边境发动大规模的武装侵犯时，他先后写了十次申请书，坚决要求奔赴前沿参加自卫反击战。在他牺牲后，还从他口袋里发现一份要求支援越南人民抗美斗争的申请书。
    哈德尔艾孜木把党和国家的利益放在首位，个人安危置之度外。有一次，食品公司失火，他奋不顾身地从屋顶跳入库房，与熊熊的烈火搏斗，抢救国家财产。城郊干渠决口时，他不惧严寒冰冻，跳到刺骨的水中打桩堵口，上岸时，浑身已冻得青紫，他却毫不在意。
    哈德尔艾孜木对人民群众充满了深厚的阶级感情。驻地附近有位七十多岁的老贫农帕提木汉，年迈体弱，无儿无女，哈德尔艾孜木就象对待自己的母亲一样照顾她。老人十分感动，亲自找到队上感谢。当他听说库车地区遭了大水灾时，就马上把平时节约下来的一百五十多元和一套棉衣、单衣，捐献给灾区人民。
      在春风雨露下成长
    哈德尔艾孜木是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的共产主义战士。一九六○年军委和林彪副主席提出了“一定要把毛泽东思想学到手”的号召，他热烈响应，如饥似渴地学习。他在日记中写道：“我感到毛主席的话，句句是真理，我一定要把毛泽东思想作为自己一切行动的指南。”
    他学习毛主席著作，善于联系实际，活学活用，不断改造思想。他在学习《纪念白求恩》后写道：“我要做一个什么样的人？做一个永远忠于党，忠于人民，为党为人民不惜任何牺牲的人。”学了《为人民服务》，他要做一个象中印边界自卫反击作战中的战斗英雄司马义买买提那样的战士。读过《关于重庆谈判》，他立志永远做人民的勤务员。
    哈德尔艾孜木不仅自己认真学习毛主席著作，照毛主席指示办事，而且关心大家的学习，用毛泽东思想武装战士的头脑。新战士一入伍，他就买毛主席著作单行本送给他们。
    在平时的工作中，哈德尔艾孜木专拣重担挑，为战士作出榜样。

    哈德尔艾孜木牺牲以后，为表彰他舍己为人、全心全意为人民服务的崇高品质，公安部队首长给他追记一等功，公安部队党委和新疆军区党委作出决定，号召全体指战员向他学习。　辛喀通
