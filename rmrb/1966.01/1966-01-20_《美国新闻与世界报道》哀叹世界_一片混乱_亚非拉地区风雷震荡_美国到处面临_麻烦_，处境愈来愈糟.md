    "U.S. News & World Report" laments the world "in a state of chaos"
    Asia, Africa, and Latin America are experiencing tumultuous changes
    The United States faces "trouble" everywhere, its situation deteriorating

    "U.S. News & World Report" published an article last December, looking ahead to the future of the world. Here is an abstract:

    In the minds of American officials, the world is in a state of chaos, and it seems that it will get worse rather than better. At one time, the United States hoped to "adjust" many problems through the United Nations, expressing some optimism that the world might become both stable and orderly. However, it seems that the chaos is getting worse.

    First is the Vietnam War, which has a great danger of continuing to "gradually escalate." The United States hopes to force the communists to agree to negotiations based on strength, resulting in the intensification of ground warfare. It seems safe to say that the scale and cost of this war will approach the level of the Korean War in the coming months.

    However, American officials believe that the chaos in the world today is widespread and profound. Vietnam is not the only place that causes concern. There are many worrying things in other parts of Asia, as well as in Africa, Latin America, and Western Europe.

    On the African continent, the situation south of the Sahara continues to be very unstable, and Rhodesia is a new powder keg. In the Congo (Leopoldville), Kenya, and other newly independent African countries, life is not easy for wealthy white people. The whole of Black Africa is at risk of rebellion at any time.

    Looking at South America, which is closer to home, one finds a volatile continent gradually heading towards a real crisis. Political stability in South American countries has always been a distant dream. Economic development is frustratingly slow. The American idea of ​​Latin American stability and development has now proven to be a dream. One problem this continent faces first is the potential for widespread famine soon. The United States cannot do anything to stop communist infiltration in Latin America. However, at the Rio de Janeiro conference, the United States found that Latin American countries were unresponsive to the urgent American proposal for collective defense (establishment of a Pan-American force) to prevent communist infiltration.

    Looking at the Dominican Republic, American troops are suppressing the revolution and restoring order. But the Dominican Republic remains a powder keg.

    Now turning to Western Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as an alliance, is in serious trouble. De Gaulle's every move is challenging the United States and NATO, and he is determined to reduce or eliminate American influence in Western Europe and replace it with his own. This stake determines that the North Atlantic Treaty is facing a dead end.

### 《美国新闻与世界报道》哀叹世界“一片混乱”  亚非拉地区风雷震荡  美国到处面临“麻烦”，处境愈来愈糟

    《美国新闻与世界报道》哀叹世界“一片混乱”
    亚非拉地区风雷震荡
    美国到处面临“麻烦”，处境愈来愈糟
    《美国新闻与世界报道》去年十二月发表文章，展望今后世界前景。摘要如下：
    在美国官员的心目中，世界正处在一片混乱中，而且看来将愈来愈糟，而不是愈来愈好。有一个时期，美国曾经寄望通过联合国来“调整”许多问题，从而对世界可能变得既稳定而又有秩序一点表示乐观。但是，看来混乱还是愈来愈糟。
    首先是越南战争，这场战争有继续“逐步升级”的极大危险。美国希望以实力为基础来迫使共产党人同意谈判，结果造成了地面战争的加剧。看来可以肯定地说，这场战争的规模和代价，将在今后几个月接近朝鲜战争的水平。
    不过，美国官员认为，今天世界的混乱是广泛而又深刻的，越南并不是唯一使人忧虑的地方。亚洲其它地方，以及非洲、拉丁美洲和西欧，都有许多使人忧虑的事情。
    在非洲大陆，撒哈拉以南的局势继续是很不稳定的，罗得西亚就是一个新火药桶。在刚果（利）、肯尼亚和非洲其它新独立的国家，对富有的白人来说，日子并不好过。整个黑非洲都有随时发生叛乱的危险。
    再看看更加接近本国的南美洲时，就会发现一个动荡不定的大陆正在逐渐走向真正的危机。政治稳定在南美各国始终是遥远无期。经济的发展慢得令人沮丧。美国希望拉丁美洲稳定和发展的想法，目前已证明是一场梦想。这个大陆首先碰到的一个问题，就是不久可能出现广泛的饥荒。美国对于阻止共产党在拉丁美洲的渗透，是不可能有所作为的。但是，美国在里约热内卢会议上，发现拉丁美洲各国对美国要求以集体防御（成立泛美部队）来防止共产党渗透的紧急建议，竟然无动于衷。
    再看多米尼加，美国军队在那里镇压革命和恢复秩序。但是多米尼加仍然是一个火药桶。
    现在转到西欧去，北大西洋公约组织作为一个联盟来说，正在陷入严重的麻烦中。戴高乐的一举一动，都在向美国和北大西洋公约挑战，他决心要降低或消除美国在西欧的影响，而代之以他自己的影响。这种利害关系决定了北大西洋公约面临穷途末路。
