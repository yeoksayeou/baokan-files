    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 17th. Our reporter reports: The First Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference was held here for thirteen days and just concluded on the 15th. Over these days, approximately 500 delegates from 82 countries and regions, more than 60 observers, and 70 special invitees gathered here. From the conference's platform, a powerful voice emanated, calling for the people of the three continents to unite against the aggression and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, to support the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist American aggression and save the nation, and the anti-imperialist struggles of people of all countries. This voice converged into an irresistible torrent, impacting everything and shattering all kinds of conspiracies and tricks plotted by the Soviet delegation under the guise of anti-imperialism and unity.
    With the joint efforts of the vast majority of delegates from the three continents attending the conference, and after thirteen days of repeated struggle and fierce debate, the line of upholding unity against imperialism, reflecting the will of over two billion people from the three continents, finally won a significant victory. The Khrushchev revisionists' conspiracy to manipulate the conference, peddle their "joint action" wares, and push their capitulationist and splittist line was thoroughly exposed and resolutely rejected. Their attempt to control the three-continent anti-imperialist organizations, abolish the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, and thus bring the national democratic movements of the three continents into the orbit of US-Soviet cooperation dominating the world also failed.
    The general declaration adopted by the conference clearly pointed out that the current international situation is favorable to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, sternly denounced US imperialism as the implacable enemy of the people of the world and an international gendarme, and resoundingly declared: Revolution is justified, anti-imperialism is justified, and oppressed nations and peoples have the right to wage people's armed struggle to defeat the aggression and armed suppression of imperialism and its lackeys.
    The resolution on Vietnam adopted by the conference condemned the US imperialists' criminal aggression against the Vietnamese people, exposed the "Fourteen Points Plan" hoax played by the Johnson administration, and strongly denounced the "peace offensive" launched by the American aggressors as a conspiracy to cover up the expansion of the war.
    The resolution on organizational matters adopted by the conference foiled the long-planned attempt by the Khrushchev revisionists to abolish the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, which has an eight-year history of anti-imperialism.
    The conference also adopted a general political resolution and a series of separate resolutions. These resolutions expressed firm support for the just struggles of the people of all countries on the three continents against imperialism headed by the United States and old and new colonialism, and reflected the strong will of the people of the three continents for revolution and anti-imperialism. Only a small number of resolutions contained some elements that violated the legitimate aspirations of the people of the three continents.

    Mainstream and Countercurrent
    The vast majority of delegates insisted on unity and struggle against US imperialism
    The Soviet delegates peddled a capitulationist line and engaged in splittist activities
    Most of the delegates came to Havana with a common goal: The First Three Continents People's Solidarity Conference should be a conference against imperialism, old and new colonialism, headed by the United States, a conference to denounce US imperialism and support the anti-American struggle of the people of all countries, especially the Vietnamese people, to save the nation.
    The Preparatory Committee decided to add a new item to the first major item on the conference agenda, "The struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism": "Supporting the Vietnamese People's Heroic Struggle Against US Imperialist Aggression, for the Liberation of South Vietnam and the Reunification of the Entire Country," and list this as the first item on the first agenda.
    Of the seventy-two delegates who spoke at the conference, the vast majority expressed their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle and specifically condemned the US aggression and war policies. The delegates, combining their own national circumstances, denounced the monstrous crimes committed by US imperialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America: it is "gradually escalating" the war of aggression against Vietnam; it has intensified the war of aggression against Laos; it has threatened and violated the territory of Cambodia; it has sent troops to occupy Thailand; it colluded with British imperialism to create "Malaysia"; it colluded with the Indonesian rightists to suppress progressive people's forces; it occupied China's territory of Taiwan; it colluded with Japanese militarism to create the "Japan-Korea Treaty," threatening the security of the Asian people; it cooperated with the Soviet Union to arm the Indian reactionaries and carry out expansion against India's neighbors; it used Israel as a base for aggression against the Arab people; it colluded with old colonialism and armed suppression of the national liberation struggle of the Congolese (L) people; it encouraged British imperialism to support the white colonial rule in Southern Rhodesia; it supported the British and Portuguese white colonial authorities through partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to consolidate their rule in southern Africa; it has been subverting and blockading Cuba and occupying Guantanamo Base; it sent 40,000 invading troops to suppress the Dominican uprising; it supported Latin American reactionary puppet governments to continue the rule of US monopoly capital in Latin America... The righteous voices of the delegates, like thunder, crossed the Gulf of Mexico and impacted the North American empire.
    In the speeches at this conference, about thirty speakers advocated waging people's armed struggle to defeat the aggression and armed suppression of imperialism and its lackeys. Many also condemned the United Nations as a tool for US imperialism to invade Asia, Africa, and Latin America, criticized the talk of peaceful coexistence with US imperialism, and exposed the slogan of cooperating with US imperialism and engaging in "joint action" with reactionaries that some people have recently advocated.
    In the group discussions, many delegates demanded that the documents adopted by the conference should reflect the current situation of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the three continents, especially the struggle against US imperialism, oppose peaceful coexistence with US imperialism and any form of cooperation, and launched a tit-for-tat struggle against the Soviet delegation and its small group of followers.
    It was under this situation that the conference adopted a relatively good general declaration. In the drafting process of this general declaration, the erroneous things that could not reflect the strong anti-imperialist demands of the people of the three continents and the situation of anti-imperialist struggle were finally negated through repeated consultations and struggles; the correct opinions put forward by delegations from China, North Korea, Japan, and other countries were finally accepted. This general declaration reflected the mainstream of the conference and was the keynote of the conference.
    However, a countercurrent also appeared at the meeting, conflicting with the mainstream of the meeting. Before the opening of the conference, the Soviet representatives vigorously promoted their so-called "peaceful coexistence" capitulationist line at the Three Continents Conference, and vigorously engaged in splittist activities. After the opening of the conference, they have been nervously plotting conspiracies, sometimes adopting a tortoise policy and sometimes coming forward to peddle their goods. This has aroused a series of struggles inside and outside the venue, just like the weather in Havana these days, sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny.
  Supporting the Vietnamese People or Helping Johnson
      The vast majority of delegates supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation
      The Soviet delegates did not dare to offend US imperialism but served the "peace talks" fraud
    In the speeches at the conference and group meetings, the delegates generally strongly condemned US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, supported the Vietnamese people in carrying out the people's war against US aggression to the end, exposed the recent US "peace talks" conspiracy, especially Johnson's Fourteen Points Plan, and condemned any cooperation with US imperialism on the Vietnam issue.
    Many delegates pointed out that the Vietnam issue can only be resolved in accordance with the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, especially the withdrawal of all aggressive troops of the United States and its puppets from Vietnam.
    In the face of the powerful voice of the conference unanimously condemning US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet delegates sometimes followed suit and condemned the United States a few times. However, at a time when the United States was engaging in new peace talks conspiracies and the Soviet Union was correspondingly sending senior officials to carry out activities in all directions, they came to Havana with other purposes, and what they implemented toward the United States was: small scolding and big help.
    The Soviet delegates dared not strongly condemn the United States' aggression against Vietnam in their speeches at the conference, and dared not forcefully expose the conspiracy of the American aggressors to try every means to stay in South Vietnam, but only promoted "achieving peace in Vietnam" with ulterior motives, which coincided with the US imperialism's "peace talks" fraud. The Soviet representatives said lightly at the meeting that "American imperialists hypocritically talk about negotiations," but even such a faint statement was deleted by the Soviet TASS when it was published. This cover-up method of the Khrushchev revisionists can only further expose their true face of working hard for Johnson's "peace talks" fraud.
    The Soviet delegates, posing as benefactors, kept silent about the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle for national salvation's powerful support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, and bragged about the Soviet Union's "aid" to Vietnam in modern weapons such as aircraft and rockets. He also insisted that since some countries were unable to transport materials to Vietnam, he proposed the establishment of an international aid-to-Vietnam fund organization. This approach of theirs aroused dissatisfaction among the delegates.
    Indonesian and other representatives pointed out that the Vietnamese people's victory in the anti-American struggle mainly relied on their own struggle, and also received international support. Not only the socialist countries supported Vietnam, but the Vietnamese people also supported the people of the world with their heroic struggle. He also said that it is not only the rich who are qualified to aid Vietnam.
    The Chinese representative pointed out that it is the internationalist obligation of socialist countries to support Vietnam, so what is the need for the Soviet representative to suggest the establishment of an international fund organization? Why does the Vietnamese people not have the right to directly receive international aid, but must go through this international organization? Isn't this just trying to control the aid of the people of the three continents to the Vietnamese people in the hands of this organization?
    The Chinese representative also sharply pointed out: The Soviet representatives are deliberately playing tricks at the meeting and emphasizing the issue of transporting aid to Vietnam, which is repeating the lie spread by the Soviet newspapers that China is obstructing the transit of Vietnamese materials through its territory.
    The Soviet representatives' making such a big fuss about the issue of aid to Vietnam did not help them achieve those ulterior motives. On the contrary, it once again exposed their double purpose: First, to use aid to Vietnam to interfere in the situation in Vietnam in order to obtain capital for transactions with the United States, and second, to incite anti-China sentiment at the meeting and engage in split activities under the smoke screen of "joint action."
    Resolutely Opposing US Imperialism or "Peaceful Coexistence"
    Many delegates strongly opposed "peaceful coexistence" with US imperialism
    Soviet delegates selling their goods exposed their false anti-imperialist face
    The common demand of the vast majority of delegates attending the conference was to push the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the three continents to a new high tide through the conference. However, the Khrushchev revisionists, from the very beginning, tried to impose their so-called "peaceful coexistence" capitulationist line on the conference and bring the liberation movements of the three continents into the orbit of US-Soviet cooperation dominating the world. The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article on the day the conference began, saying that "striving for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems," "striving for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery," and "the struggle for universal peace" "will be the topics discussed at the Havana conference." Then, the Soviet delegation brought out their set of goods at the conference.
    In the Political Committee, the Soviet representatives insisted on inserting a paragraph about so-called "peaceful coexistence" into the draft of the general resolution of the Political Committee. They did not mention opposing imperialism headed by the United States, but demanded that "regardless of the size of the country, peaceful coexistence should be the basis of their relations."
    Representatives from China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaya, Congo (L), Southwest Africa and other countries and regions resolutely opposed imposing this erroneous line on the people of the three continents. The Chinese representative said that what the Three Continents Conference should discuss is the issue of the people of the three continents uniting against imperialism, not the issue of peaceful coexistence. It is absolutely wrong to talk about peaceful coexistence between large and small countries without opposing imperialism. Can Vietnam and Dominica peacefully coexist with the United States? The Congolese (L) representative asked emotionally: The Congolese people don't even have the right to exist, so what are we talking about peaceful coexistence? The Southwest African representative said that the Three Continents Conference is not the United Nations, it is not a hodgepodge, there is no peaceful coexistence here; either struggle or surrender. We will never surrender! The Ugandan representative pointed out that emphasizing peaceful coexistence at such a meeting shows that some people are trying to bring the national liberation struggle into the orbit of "peaceful coexistence" and "complete and thorough disarmament" to hinder the development of the anti-imperialist struggle. He asked: "Are you talking about peaceful coexistence in your mouths, whether you want everyone not to support the anti-American war in Vietnam and compromise with the United States?"
    Due to the strong opposition of many delegates, the Soviet representatives' effort to forcibly insert the so-called "peaceful coexistence" into the general political resolution did not succeed. The conference decided to delete the paragraph insisted upon by the Soviet representative from the draft resolution. However, the struggle did not end. When the Political Committee continued from 9:30 pm on the 11th to 6:00 am on the 12th, a document on so-called peaceful coexistence was suddenly proposed in the form of a special draft resolution.
    At this time, some Khrushchevist followers, in order to support this proposal, made a big noise and nakedly moved out Khrushchev's goods from that year. One person said in his speech that now is the era of nuclear weapons, and mankind faces two choices, either peaceful coexistence or nuclear war, and we want to choose peace. He also said that "peaceful coexistence" is a necessary condition for carrying out revolutionary struggle and a new form of liberation struggle; with the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, the hands and feet of imperialism can be restrained, and the liberation struggle in many places can achieve victory with the help of the Soviet Union.
    Many national representatives were angered. The Ugandan representative said that the conference should discuss the common enemy of the people of the three continents, US imperialism. Can we stop US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam by talking about "peaceful coexistence"? If the conference passes such a resolution, it will separate itself from the broad masses of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Nepalese representative said that national relations are a matter for diplomats, and we should discuss the anti-imperialist struggle that is related to ourselves. The Bechuanaland representative said that the people of Bechuanaland have never known the imperialist powers to respect the sovereignty of small countries. The Southwest African representative said excitedly: We resolutely oppose promoting this monster of "peaceful coexistence" here, no matter what color it is painted.
    Amid the strong opposition, the chairman announced the vote. Representatives from China, Indonesia, Japan, North Korea, Malaya, Thailand, Nepal, Pakistan, Uganda, Southwest Africa, Bechuanaland, and Basutoland voted against. Representatives from the Soviet Union, India, and other countries voted in favor. Many other representatives abstained. According to the rules of procedure, if a consensus cannot be reached, it must be passed by a two-thirds majority, but the chairman who controlled this meeting did not explain how many votes were in favor and announced that it was "passed." What is even stranger is that this debate lasted from 9:30 pm to 9:30 am, and many people were exhausted by this meeting and wanted to go to sleep. A group of "voters" suddenly came in before the vote, some of whom had just been pulled out of bed, sleepy-eyed, and raised their hands as well. In this way, the resolution on "peaceful coexistence" was announced as passed.
    Many delegates expressed dissatisfaction with the passage of such a resolution at the fighting Three Continents Conference. Yumbu, the head of the Congolese (L) delegation, said angrily that passing this resolution means destroying the achievements of the Three Continents Conference and means recognizing Mobutu, which is not in line with the cause of the Congo and Africa. What the Soviet representatives got by insisting on putting this document on the conference was that they opposed themselves to the people of the three continents who resolutely demanded anti-imperialism and revolution, thus once again exposing their face of false anti-imperialism and true surrender.
    Condemning the United Nations or Praising the United Nations
    The United Nations acting as a tool of US imperialism is well known
    The praise of the Soviet representatives and their partners was refuted powerfully
    At the meeting, many representatives forcefully exposed that the United Nations is a tool for US imperialism to invade the people of the three continents.
    The Indonesian representative said: We must further expose the hateful face of the imperialists, who use the United Nations as a tool to rule the world and deceive the people of the world.
    The Pakistani representative said: The United Nations is still ruled and used by the imperialist powers. It continues to deprive the 700 million Chinese of their legitimate status in this organization. Its intervention in Korea, Pakistan, Kashmir and the Congo has complicated matters in those places, which is beneficial to the imperialists and colonialists.
    However, in order to adapt to the need to use the United Nations as an exchange for the United States and the Soviet Union to dominate the world, the Soviet representatives and their followers tried their best to defend the United Nations at the meeting. If anyone touched the United Nations, they would scream and defend the United Nations.
    In the Urgent Issues Subcommittee, the Dominican representative proposed a proposal to condemn the United Nations organization because it could not defend the people's right to self-determination and could not prevent military intervention against the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This situation actually made this organization a tool of colonialism and neo-colonialism.
    The Soviet representative sat silently in the venue. At this time, the representative of the African National Congress of South Africa, who often echoed the Soviet representative's claims on some issues, came out to oppose, saying that there are many Asian and African representatives in the United Nations and people are not allowed to condemn it. Representatives from China, North Korea, Congo (L) and many others painfully exposed the crimes of the United Nations. The Chinese representative firmly supported the Dominican proposal, pointing out that it was precisely the United Nations that legalized the US armed aggression against Dominica under the cooperation of the Soviet Union and the United States through the so-called "ceasefire" resolution in Dominica. The Korean representative strongly condemned the crime of the United States invading Korea under the banner of the United Nations. The Congolese (L) representative sadly asked: "The United Nations came to our country, but where is our Lumumba? Where is our Republic of the Congo? I saw the situation at that time, and saw the laughter of the United Nations representative when Lumumba was killed. We know best what the United Nations is!"
    Before the vote, the Dominican representative asked the Soviet representative to express his attitude. The Soviet representative quickly said that he agreed with the opinion of another representative and "modified" this sentence, not saying that the United Nations was "a tool of old and new colonialism." The Soviet representative finally voted against the Dominican representative's proposal.
    At another meeting of this subcommittee, the proposal on South Africa put forward by the representative of the African National Congress of South Africa required the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries to "implement all resolutions of the United Nations." This once again aroused the anger of the representatives. The Chinese representative asked, is this asking the Chinese to implement the United Nations resolution condemning themselves as "aggressors"? The Congolese (L) representative asked: Is this asking the Congolese to oppose their own country, the Congo? Everyone asked the representative of the African National Congress of South Africa to clarify. The representative of the African National Congress of South Africa was forced to agree to delete this paragraph at the meeting the next day. At this time, the courage of the Soviet representative suddenly increased, and he insisted that the African National Congress of South Africa was the only organization in South Africa that was carrying out underground struggle, and said: "Please pass the resolution according to their request!" This further angered representatives from Venezuela, Brazil, and other countries. Under the accusations of most of the representatives, the representative of the African National Congress of South Africa was forced to reiterate the deletion of this paragraph, and this was the end of the matter.
    When the Political Committee drafted the general resolution, the Chinese delegation solemnly pointed out that the resolution should only expose and condemn the United Nations as a tool for aggression, as many representatives have requested. The Indian representative proposed an amendment to try to excuse the United Nations, but could not come up with a reason to defend the United Nations. Therefore, the resolution finally included the following paragraph: "The conference condemns the repeated use of the United Nations by US imperialism as a tool for its policy of aggression against national liberation movements and for aggression against countries such as the Congo, Korea, and Dominica. The conference also condemns the United Nations for depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate seat in this organization under the manipulation of the United States." The Capitulationist and Splittist Essence of "Joint Action"
    Unity against the enemy must unite all truly anti-American and anti-imperialist forces
    The Soviet representatives' so-called "joint action" aims to promote US-Soviet cooperation
    The vast majority of delegates at the meeting expressed the desire of the people of the three continents to unite against the common enemy—imperialism headed by the United States. Wu Xueqian, head of the Chinese delegation, pointed out in his speech that "when the struggle between aggression and anti-aggression is very sharp, we need to unite all truly anti-imperialist forces to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism headed by the United States."
    However, the "joint action" shouted by the Soviet delegation was completely different. It attempted to use the legitimate desire of the people of the three continents for unity to impose the line of Soviet-US cooperation dominating the world on this conference under the false slogan of so-called "joint action" and "common enemy."
    In the course of the conference, a series of facts proved that the Soviet delegation's repeated talk of "unity," "joint," "coordinated," etc., was only to cover up their capitulationism and splitism. However, they failed. The ugly essence of the "joint action" they vigorously promoted was thoroughly exposed at the conference.
    Representatives from China, Indonesia, Japan and other countries sharply raised such questions: Who exactly does the Soviet representative want to take joint action with? Who do you want to unite to oppose? Wu Xueqian, head of the Chinese delegation, put forward ten "whys" to them in his speech at the conference. The Soviet representatives never dared to answer these ten questions.
    But their actions gave the answer: At the meeting, representatives from Dominica and Cambodia resolutely opposed any form of cooperation with US imperialism. The Cambodian representative proposed a proposal in the Urgent Issues Subcommittee, demanding that all justice-upholding and peace-loving countries "refuse to cooperate with the US government and all governments that actively support its policy of aggression against Indochina in all political, diplomatic, economic and cultural aspects." The Soviet representative just didn't raise his hand when voting.
    People are asking: On this sharp issue of opposing cooperation with imperialism, what position does the Soviet representative stand on?
    At the meeting of the Urgent Issues Subcommittee, the Indonesian representative proposed a proposal condemning the Indonesian reactionary soldiers for suppressing progressive forces. The Soviet representative not only did not support it, but even prevented the proposal from being included in the agenda of the Urgent Issues Subcommittee. This once again shows that the Soviet representatives stood on the side of the Indonesian right wing.
    When discussing the proposal of the Palestinian representative, the representative of the Portuguese colony suggested adding a sentence: "Sever all relations with Israel." This suggestion was supported by the majority of representatives. But the Soviet representative opposed severing "all relations."
    There are too many examples to cite. No wonder, after the discussion of the subcommittee, an African representative said: The things that the Soviet representative was thinking about were greatly exposed. An Asian representative said that as long as it hurts the United States, the Soviet representative will stand up to defend it. Who the Soviet representatives want to unite with and who they want to oppose is clear.
  The Plan to Control the Three Continents Solidarity Organization Has Failed
      The Asian-African People's Solidarity Movement and its anti-imperialist tradition must be maintained
      The Soviet Union's sabotage of the Asian-African People's solidarity anti-imperialist cause cannot succeed
    The organizational manifestation of the Khrushchev revisionists' "joint action" slogan is: to establish a new Asian, African, and Latin American organization and subordinate it to the Khrushchev revisionist group and organizations such as the World Peace Council under its control, to abolish the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, in order to destroy the Asian-African People's solidarity anti-imperialist cause. To this end, they clamored to "expand" the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization into a three-continent organization.
    For many years, the anti-imperialist organizations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been brewing to convene the Three Continents People's Solidarity Conference. In December 1961, the Executive Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization met in Gaza and decided to initiate the preparation and convening of the Three Continents Conference by representatives of anti-imperialist organizations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In February 1963, the Third Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Moshi, Tanzania, decided that the Three Continents Conference would be held in Havana and decided to establish a preparatory committee composed of representatives from 18 countries to carry out preparatory work. In May 1965, the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winneba, Ghana, decided that the First Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference would be held in Havana in January 1966.
    For ulterior purposes, the Khrushchev revisionists have been obstructing the convening of the Three Continents Conference for a considerable period of time. However, in the past year, they suddenly changed their approach and adopted the method of actively intervening, manipulating, and controlling the preparatory work of the conference, attempting to change the anti-imperialist nature of the Three Continents Conference. They tried their best to obstruct and exclude representatives of truly anti-imperialist forces on the three continents from attending this conference. Even the representatives of certain truly anti-imperialist organizations were refused access to the conference hall after overcoming many difficulties to arrive in Havana.
    On the eve of the opening of the Three Continents Conference, representatives from the Soviet Union, India, and other countries shuttled back and forth in the "Free Havana" Hotel, initiating a signature campaign to request the convening of a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Havana. It was revealed that they intended to propose the "expansion" of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization and the establishment of a three-continent organization at this meeting. This meant that they were plotting to hold a "funeral" for the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Havana. However, this signature-gathering campaign quickly died.
    The Chinese delegation sent a letter to the member states of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, resolutely opposing the illegal convening of the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization during the Three Continents Conference. This frustrated the conspiracy of the Soviet and Indian representatives.
    After the opening of the conference, the head of the Soviet delegation formally proposed the establishment of a three-continent organization in his speech at the conference. In the subcommittee, they advocated that all kinds of mass organizations on the three continents should "cooperate forever" and "closely contact" international organizations such as the World Peace Council controlled by the Soviet Union.
    Many representatives, starting from strengthening the unity of the people of the three continents in the anti-imperialist struggle, also hoped to establish a three-continent organization. However, the vast majority of them disagreed with abolishing the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization.
    A few representatives from the Soviet Union, India and other countries insisted on making a resolution at this conference to "expand" the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization into a three-continent organization. The Indian representative said, "Small rivers flow into big rivers, and small rivers don't need to exist!" Many representatives refuted this. The Indonesian representative refuted, if a larger regional organization is established, the organization in the smaller area must be abolished, then, after the establishment of the African People's Organization, should the Arab League also be abolished? After the establishment of the Asian-African Journalists Association, must the Pan-African Journalists Association also be abolished?
    The Chinese representative pointed out that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization has made significant contributions to the Asian-African national liberation struggle in recent years. Abolishing the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization will not only bring division to the Asian-African solidarity movement, but will also bring serious threats to the three-continent solidarity movement.
    The result of the discussion by the Organizing Committee of the conference was to reject any proposal to abolish the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization. The attempt of the Soviet representatives failed again.
    The Soviet representatives' activities to undermine Asian, African, and Latin American solidarity reached a new peak on the day before the closing of the conference (14th). Regardless of the resolutions already passed by the conference, they insisted on squeezing into the executive secretariat of the three-continent organization. Before this, delegations from various countries had held meetings on the 13th, and after consultation, the members of the secretary of the "Executive Secretariat of the Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Organization" which the Three Continents Conference decided to establish were produced. The members of the four Asian countries are: North Korea, South Vietnam, Pakistan, and Syria. At the meeting of the heads of Asian delegations held on the 14th, the Soviet delegation suddenly proposed to overturn the Asian secretary list that had been negotiated and produced, and said with self-recommendation, "If the Asian people want the Soviet Union to shoulder any responsibility, the Soviet Union is always willing to shoulder it." This action of the Soviet delegation aroused the indignation of the delegations of various Asian countries. Phong Vihi, the head of the Laotian delegation, repeatedly questioned: Does the list passed on the 13th count? He also insisted that the list that has been passed should become the decision of the conference. The Japanese representative said that there has never been such a precedent in international conferences, and the resolution that has just been passed is about to be overturned. From more than 5 o'clock in the afternoon of that day until more than 1 o'clock in the morning, the Soviet representatives kept entangled in the issue of the Asian secretary list. Under the unanimous condemnation of representatives from China, Japan, Indonesia, Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea, South Vietnam, etc., the Soviet representatives were finally forced to withdraw their request.
            Concluding Remarks
    The Three Continents Conference was a serious struggle. This is a struggle between two different lines: Is it to resolutely fight imperialism and old and new colonialism headed by the United States, or to coexist peacefully with them? Is it to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the people's war against US aggression to the end, or to help US imperialism implement the big "peace talks" conspiracy? Is it to resolutely condemn and expose the UN, the tool of US imperialist aggression, or to cover up the act of the US and Soviet Union trading the fate of the people of the three continents in the UN? Is it for the people of the three continents to unite and form the broadest united front against imperialism headed by the United States, or to engage in "joint action" to bring the ever-increasing national liberation struggles of the three continents into the orbit of the US and Soviet Union dominating the world? Is it to establish a new organization controlled by the Khrushchev revisionist group to promote its erroneous line and abolish the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization with an eight-year anti-imperialist tradition, or to promote the solidarity movement of the three continents on the basis of maintaining the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization and its anti-imperialist tradition?
    The outcome of the struggle shows that the set of erroneous lines peddled by the Khrushchev revisionists at the meeting, as well as their conspiracy to undermine the Asian-African solidarity movement and control the three-continent solidarity movement, have been smashed to pieces by the joint efforts of the representatives of the three continents. Their faces of false anti-imperialism and true surrender, false support and true betrayal, false unity and true split have been greatly exposed once again, and have once again educated the people of the three continents from the opposite side.
    The Three Continents People's Solidarity Movement encountered various reefs from the very beginning. However, in accordance with the will of the people of the three continents, this movement is crushing all reefs with overwhelming power and advancing victoriously towards the goal of opposing imperialism headed by the United States and striving for national liberation with full confidence.

    新华社记者报道亚非拉人民团结会议上两条路线斗争的经过
    亚非拉人民团结反美斗争大高涨大胜利
    苏联新领导投降分裂阴谋大暴露大失败
    新华社哈瓦那十七日电  本社记者报道：第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议在这里举行了十三天，十五日刚刚结束。这些天来，这里聚集了来自八十二个国家和地区的约五百名代表，六十多名观察员和七十多名特邀人士。从大会的讲坛上发出了三大洲人民团结起来反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和战争政策、支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争和各国人民反帝斗争的强大呼声。这种呼声汇成一股不可阻挡的洪流，冲击着一切，粉碎了苏联代表团在假反帝、假团结外衣下策划的形形色色的阴谋与诡计。
    在参加会议的三大洲绝大多数代表的共同努力下，经过十三天的反复斗争和激烈辩论，反映三大洲二十多亿人民意志的坚持团结反帝的路线终于赢得了重大的胜利。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者企图操纵会议，兜售他们“联合行动”的货色以便推行他们投降主义和分裂主义路线的阴谋，遭到了彻底的暴露和坚决的拒绝。他们控制三大洲团结反帝组织，取消亚非人民团结组织，以便把三大洲的民族民主运动纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道的企图，也破产了。
    会议通过的总宣言，明确地指出当前国际形势有利于反帝革命斗争，严厉地声讨美帝国主义是全世界人民不共戴天的敌人和国际宪兵，并且响亮地宣布：革命有理，反帝有理，被压迫民族和人民有权进行人民武装斗争打败帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和武装镇压。
    会议通过的关于越南的决议，谴责了美帝国主义对越南人民的罪恶侵略，揭露了约翰逊政府玩弄的“十四点计划”骗局，强烈指责了美国侵略者发动的“和平攻势”是掩盖扩大战争的阴谋。
    会议通过的关于组织问题的决议，挫败了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者蓄谋已久的企图取消已经具有八年反帝历史的亚非人民团结组织的计划。
    会议还通过了总政治决议和一系列分决议。这些决议表示坚决支持三大洲各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的正义斗争，反映了三洲人民要革命、要反帝的坚强意志。只有少数的决议中夹杂着某些违反三洲人民正当愿望的东西。
    主流和逆流
    绝大多数代表坚持团结斗争反对美帝
    苏联代表兜售投降路线进行分裂活动
    大多数代表来到哈瓦那，抱着一个共同的目标：第一届三大洲人民团结会议应该是一个反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义的大会，是声讨美帝国主义、声援各国人民特别是越南人民抗美救国斗争的大会。
    筹委会上决定，在大会议程上的第一大项“反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的斗争”下，加上一项新议程：“支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略、争取解放越南南方和统一全国的英勇斗争”，并且把这列为第一项议程的第一条。
    在大会上发言的七十二位代表中，绝大多数人表示支持越南人民的斗争，并且指名谴责了美国的侵略和战争政策。代表们分别结合他们本国的情况，声讨美帝国主义在亚、非、拉美三洲犯下的滔天罪行：它正在把侵略越南的战争“逐步升级”；它加剧了对老挝的侵略战争；它威胁和侵犯了柬埔寨的领土；它派军队占领了泰国；它同英帝国主义一道制造了“马来西亚”；它勾结印度尼西亚右派镇压进步人民力量；它霸占中国领土台湾；它同日本军国主义勾结，制造“日韩条约”，威胁亚洲人民的安全；它同苏联合作武装印度反动派，向印度的邻国进行扩张；它把以色列作为侵略阿拉伯人民的基地；它同老殖民主义勾结，武装镇压刚果（利）人民的民族解放斗争；它怂恿英国帝国主义支持南罗得西亚的白人殖民统治；它通过北大西洋公约组织的伙伴，支持英国、葡萄牙白人殖民当局，巩固它们在南部非洲的统治；它一直在颠覆和封锁古巴，并且占领着关塔那摩基地；它派遣四万侵略军镇压多米尼加起义；它扶植拉丁美洲反动傀儡政府，延续美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲的统治……代表们的正义呼声，有如阵阵雷鸣，越过墨西哥湾，冲击着北美的帝国。
    这次大会的发言中，有大约三十位发言者主张进行人民武装斗争，打败帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和武装镇压。许多人还谴责联合国是美帝国主义用来侵略亚、非、拉美的工具，批判了同美帝国主义和平共处的论调，揭露了一些人最近鼓吹的同美帝国主义合作、同反动派搞“联合行动”的口号。
    在小组讨论中，许多代表要求大会通过的文件应当反映当前三洲人民反帝斗争的形势，特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争形势，反对同美帝国主义和平共处和进行任何形式的合作，并且同苏联代表团及其一小撮追随者展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    正是在这种形势下，大会通过了一个比较好的总宣言。在这个总宣言的起草过程中，那些不能反映三洲人民强烈的反帝要求和反帝斗争形势的错误的东西，经过反复的协商和斗争，终于被否定了；中国、朝鲜、日本等代表团提出的正确意见，终于被接受了。这个总宣言，反映了大会的主流，是大会的基调。
    但是，会上也出现一股逆流，同会上的主流冲突着。苏联代表在会议开幕之前，就大肆宣扬要在三大洲会议上推行他们的“和平共处”投降主义路线，并大力进行分裂活动。会议开幕之后，他们一直紧张地策划阴谋，虽然有时采取龟缩政策，有时又出头来兜售他们的私货。这就在会场内外激起了一场又一场的斗争，正象这几天来哈瓦那的天气一样，一时阴云密布，一时又阳光灿烂。
  支持越南人民还是为约翰逊帮忙
      大会代表普遍支持越南人民抗美救国斗争
      苏联代表不敢触犯美帝却为和谈骗局效劳
    在大会和小组会发言中，代表们普遍地强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略越南，支持越南人民把反对美帝侵略的人民战争进行到底，揭露最近美国的“和谈”阴谋，特别是约翰逊的十四点计划，并且谴责了在越南问题上同美帝的任何合作。
    许多代表都指出，只有按照越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国的四项主张，特别是撤出美国及其仆从在越南的一切侵略军队，才能解决越南问题。
    在大会发出一致声讨美帝侵略越南的强大呼声的面前，苏联代表有时也跟着谴责美国几句。但是在美国大搞和谈新阴谋而苏联也相应地派出大员四出活动的时候，他们是抱着另外的目的来到哈瓦那的，他们对美国实行的是：小骂大帮忙。
    苏联代表在大会上发言中不敢强烈谴责美国对越南的侵略，不敢有力地揭露美国侵略者千方百计企图赖在越南南方不走的阴谋，而只是别有用心地鼓吹“在越南实现和平”，这正好同美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局相呼应。苏联代表在会上轻轻地讲了一句“美帝国主义者虚伪地谈论谈判”，但是连这样一句轻描淡写的话，苏联塔斯社在发表时也删去了。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者这种遮遮掩掩的手法，只能进一步暴露了他们正在为约翰逊的“和谈”大骗局卖力效劳的真面目。
    苏联代表以恩人自居，闭口不谈越南人民反美救国斗争对全世界人民革命斗争的有力支持，自吹自擂苏联“援助”越南飞机、火箭等现代武器。他还硬说由于某些国家无法把物资运往越南，提出要成立一个国际援助越南基金组织。他们这种做法，引起了代表们的不满。
    印度尼西亚和其他代表指出，越南人民取得反美斗争的胜利，主要是靠自己的斗争，同时也得到了国际的支援。不只是社会主义国家支援了越南，而且越南人民用自己的英勇斗争也支援了全世界人民。他还说，并不是只有有钱人才有资格援助越南的。
    中国代表指出，社会主义国家支援越南是他们应尽的国际主义义务，苏联代表建议成立国际基金机构有什么必要呢？为什么越南人民没有权利直接得到国际上的援助，而非要经过这个国际机构不可？这不是想把三洲人民对越南人民的援助控制在这个机构的手里又是什么呢？
    中国代表还尖锐地指出：苏联代表在会上故弄玄虚强调援助越南物资的运输问题，这是重复苏联报刊所散布的所谓中国阻挠转运越南物资过境的谎言。
    苏联代表在援越问题上如此大做文章，并没有帮助他们实现那些不可告人的阴谋，相反，却再一次暴露了他们的双重目的：一是利用援越来插手越南局势以便取得同美国进行交易的资本，二是为了在会上煽动反华，在“联合行动”的烟幕下搞分裂的活动。
    坚决反对美帝还是“和平共处”
    许多代表强烈反对同美帝“和平共处”
    苏联代表贩卖私货暴露了假反帝面目
    出席会议绝大多数代表的共同要求是通过会议把三大洲反帝革命斗争推向新的高涨。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者却从一开始就力图把他们的所谓“和平共处”的投降主义路线强加给会议，把三大洲的解放运动纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道。苏联《真理报》在会议开始那一天发表文章，说什么“争取不同社会制度国家和平共处”，“争取禁止核武器及其运载工具”，“争取普遍和平的斗争”，“将是哈瓦那会议上讨论的主题”。接着，苏联代表团就在会议上端出了他们的一套私货。
    在政治委员会上，苏联代表坚持要把关于所谓“和平共处”的一段话塞进政治委员会总决议草案中去。他们不提反对以美国为首的帝国主义，却要求“不论国家大小都应以和平共处作为他们之间关系的基础”。
    中国、印度尼西亚、日本、马来亚、刚果（利）、西南非等国家和地区的代表们坚决反对把这一错误路线强加给三洲人民。中国代表说，三洲会议所要讨论的，是三洲人民团结反帝的问题，而不是和平共处的问题。不反对帝国主义而笼统地说什么大小国家都和平共处是绝对错误的，难道越南、多米尼加可以同美国和平共处吗？刚果（利）代表激动地质问：刚果人民连生存的权利都没有，还谈什么和平共处？西南非代表说，三洲大会不是联合国，不是个大杂烩，这里没有和平共处；要么斗争，要么投降。我们决不投降！乌干达代表指出，在这样的会议上来强调什么和平共处，说明有人企图把民族解放斗争纳入“和平共处”、“全面彻底裁军”的轨道，来阻挠反帝斗争的发展。他质问道：“你们口口声声谈论和平共处，是否要大家不支持越南的抗美战争，而同美国妥协？”
    由于许多代表的强烈反对，苏联代表硬要把所谓“和平共处”塞进总政治决议的努力没有得逞。会议决定把苏联代表坚持的那一段话从决议草案中删去。但是，斗争并没有结束。当政治委员会从十一日晚上九点半一直开到十二日凌晨六时的时候，一个关于所谓和平共处的文件又以特别决议草案的形式，突然被提了出来。
    这时，一些赫鲁晓夫主义的追随者，为了支持这个提案，大放厥词，把赫鲁晓夫当年的货色赤裸裸地又搬弄出来。有一个人在发言中说，现在是核武器时代，人类面临着两个选择，要么是和平共处，要么是核大战，而我们要选择和平。他还说什么“和平共处”是进行革命斗争的必要条件，是解放斗争的新形式；有了苏联的和平政策，就可以束缚住帝国主义的手脚，许多地方的解放斗争就可以在苏联的帮助下取得胜利。
    许多国家代表都被激怒了。乌干达代表说，大会应当讨论反对三洲人民共同敌人美帝国主义，难道我们大谈“和平共处”就能制止美帝国主义对越南的侵略吗？大会如果通过这样的决议，将使自己脱离亚、非、拉美广大人民群众。尼泊尔代表说，国家关系是外交家们的事，我们应该讨论和自己有关的反帝斗争的问题。贝专纳代表说，贝专纳人民从来不知道帝国主义大国尊重小国主权的事情。西南非代表激动地大声说：我们坚决反对在这里宣扬“和平共处”这个怪物，不管这个怪物涂上什么颜色。
    在强大的反对声中，主席宣布付表决。中国、印度尼西亚、日本、朝鲜、马来亚、泰国、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、乌干达、西南非、贝专纳、巴苏陀兰十二个代表投反对票。苏联、印度等代表投赞成票。另外有不少代表弃权。按照议事规则，不能协商一致就要由三分之二多数通过，可是掌握这次会议的主席根本没有说明赞成票有几票就宣布“通过”了。更奇怪的是，这场争论从晚上九点半一直持续到早上九点半钟，许多人都被这会议拖得精疲力竭而要去睡觉了，到了投票前一会儿，突然进来了一帮“投票手”，有一些是刚刚从床上被拉起来的，睡眼蒙胧，也跟着举手。就这样宣布“和平共处”的决议被通过了。
    许多代表对于在战斗的三洲大会上竟通过这样的决议，表示不满。刚果（利）代表团团长尤姆布愤慨地说，通过这个决议意味着破坏三洲会议的成果，意味着承认蒙博托，这是不符合刚果和非洲的事业的。苏联代表坚持把这个文件塞给大会，所得到的是，把他们自己同坚决要求反帝、要求革命的三洲人民对立起来，从而又一次把他们假反帝、真投降的面目暴露了出来。
    谴责联合国还是吹捧联合国
    联合国充当美帝侵略工具为人所共见
    苏联代表及其伙伴的吹捧遭有力驳斥
    会上，许多代表有力地揭露了联合国是美帝国主义侵略三洲人民的工具。
    印度尼西亚代表说：我们要进一步揭露帝国主义者可憎的面貌，他们利用联合国作为统治世界、欺骗全世界人民的工具。
    巴基斯坦代表说：联合国仍然受到帝国主义强国的统治和利用。它继续剥夺七亿中国人在这一组织中的合法地位。它对朝鲜、巴基斯坦、克什米尔和刚果的干涉使那些地方的事情复杂化了，而这是对帝国主义者和殖民主义者有利的。
    但是，为了适应把联合国当作美苏两大国主宰世界的交易所这一需要，苏联代表同他们的追随者在会上竭力为联合国辩护。谁要是碰了一下联合国，他们就大叫大嚷，出来为联合国辩护。
    在紧迫问题小组委员会上，多米尼加代表提出提案，要求谴责联合国组织，因为它不能保卫人民的自决权，不能阻止对非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的军事干涉。这种状况实际上使这一组织变成殖民主义和新殖民主义的工具。
    苏联代表坐在会场上一声不响。这时，经常在一些问题上附和苏联代表主张的南非非洲人国民大会代表出来反对，说什么联合国里有许多亚非国家代表，不许人们谴责它。中国、朝鲜、刚果（利）等许多代表对联合国的罪行痛加揭露。中国代表坚决支持多米尼加的提案，指出正是联合国在苏美合作下通过在多米尼加所谓“停火”的决议，使美国武装侵略多米尼加合法化。朝鲜代表强烈谴责美国打着联合国的招牌侵略朝鲜的罪行。刚果（利）代表沉痛地质问：“联合国来到了我们的国家，可是我们的卢蒙巴到哪里去了？我们的刚果共和国到哪里去了？我看到过当时的情况，看到过杀害卢蒙巴时联合国代表的狂笑。我们最了解联合国是什么东西！”
    在付表决前，多米尼加代表要求苏联代表表示态度。苏联代表连忙说他同意另一个代表的意见，把这句话“修改”一下，不要说联合国是“新老殖民主义的工具”。苏联代表最后竟投票反对多米尼加代表的提案。
    在这个小组委员会的另一次会议上，南非非洲人国民大会代表提出的关于南非的提案中，要求亚非拉美各国人民“贯彻联合国的一切决议”。这再一次引起代表们的愤慨。中国代表问，这是不是要求中国人执行联合国谴责自己是“侵略者”的决议？刚果（利）代表问：这是不是要求刚果人反对自己的祖国刚果？大家纷纷要求南非非洲人国民大会代表澄清。南非非洲人国民大会代表被迫在第二天的会议上表示同意删去这一段。这时，苏联代表的勇气却突然增长起来，他硬说南非非洲人国民大会是南非唯一进行地下斗争的组织，并且说：“请按照他们的要求通过决议吧！”这一下更加激怒了委内瑞拉、巴西等代表。在大多数代表的指责下，南非非洲人国民大会代表被迫重申删去这一段，这样才收了场。
    在政治委员会起草总决议时，中国代表团严正指出，决议只应该按照许多代表的要求，揭露和谴责联合国是用来进行侵略的工具。印度代表却提出修正案，力图为联合国开脱，但是拿不出为联合国辩护的理由。因此，决议终于写上了下面这段话：“会议谴责联合国多次被美帝国主义利用来作为它反对民族解放运动和侵略刚果、朝鲜和多米尼加等国的侵略政策的工具。会议同样谴责联合国在美国操纵下剥夺中华人民共和国在这个组织中的合法席位”。“联合行动”的投降主义分裂主义本质
    团结对敌必须联合一切真正反美反帝的力量
    苏联代表所谓“联合行动”旨在推行美苏合作
    绝大多数代表在会上表达了三大洲人民团结起来反对共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义的愿望。中国代表团团长吴学谦在发言中指出，“当着侵略与反侵略的斗争十分尖锐的时候，我们需要联合一切真正反帝的力量，来反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义”。
    但是，苏联代表团叫嚷的“联合行动”却完全是另一回事。它企图利用三洲人民对团结的正当愿望，在所谓“联合行动”、“共同对敌”的虚伪口号下，把苏美合作主宰世界的路线强加给这次大会。
    在会议进程中，一系列的事实证明，苏联代表团口口声声讲什么“团结”、“联合”、“协调一致”等等，都不过是为了掩盖他们的投降主义和分裂主义。可是，他们失败了。他们大肆鼓吹的“联合行动”的丑恶本质，在大会上被彻底揭露了。
    中国、印度尼西亚、日本等国代表都尖锐地提出了这样的问题：苏联代表究竟要同谁联合行动？联合起来反对谁？中国代表团团长吴学谦在大会发言中向他们提出了十个“为什么”。苏联代表对于这十个问题始终不敢回答。
    但是他们的行动却作出了回答：在会上，多米尼加、柬埔寨代表坚决反对同美帝国主义任何形式的合作。柬埔寨代表在紧迫问题小组委员会上提出提案，要求一切主持正义和爱好和平的国家，“拒绝在所有政治、外交、经济和文化方面同美国政府和一切积极支持它对印度支那的侵略政策的各国政府合作。”在投票表决时，苏联代表就是不举手。
    人们都问：在反对同帝国主义合作的这个尖锐问题上，苏联代表又站到什么立场上去了？
    在紧迫问题小组委员会会议上，印度尼西亚代表提出一个谴责印度尼西亚反动军人镇压进步力量的提案，苏联代表不但不予支持，甚至不让这个提案列入紧迫问题小组委员会的议程。这又一次说明，苏联代表站到印度尼西亚右派一边去了。
    在讨论巴勒斯坦代表的提案时，葡属殖民地代表建议加上一句：“断绝同以色列的一切关系”。这个建议得到多数代表的支持。可是苏联代表却反对断绝“一切关系”。
    例子举不胜举。无怪乎在小组委员会的讨论之后，一位非洲代表说：苏联代表心里想的东西都大大地暴露出来了。一位亚洲代表说，只要一触痛美国，苏联代表就要挺身出来加以维护。苏联代表究竟要联合谁、反对谁，再也清楚不过了。
  控制三大洲团结组织的计划破了产
      亚非人民团结运动及其反帝传统必须维护
      苏联破坏亚非人民团结反帝事业不能得逞
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的“联合行动”口号在组织路线上的体现是：要建立一个新的亚、非、拉美三洲组织，并使它从属于赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团及其控制下的世界和平理事会之类的组织，取消亚非人民团结组织，以破坏亚非人民的团结反帝事业。为此目的，他们大肆叫嚷要把亚非人民团结组织“扩大”成三洲组织。
    多年以来，亚、非、拉美的反帝组织一直在酝酿召开三大洲人民团结会议。一九六一年十二月，亚非人民团结组织执委会在加沙开会，决定发起由亚、非、拉美反帝组织的代表来筹备和召开三大洲会议。一九六三年二月，在坦桑尼亚的莫希举行的第三届亚非人民团结会议决定三大洲会议在哈瓦那召开，并决定成立由十八国代表组成的筹备委员会来进行筹备工作。一九六五年五月，在加纳的温尼巴举行的第四届亚非人民团结会议决定于一九六六年一月在哈瓦那举行第一届亚、非、拉美人民团结会议。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了不可告人的目的，在一段相当长的时间里，一直阻挠三洲会议的召开。但近一年来，他们忽然改变，采取了积极插手、操纵和控制会议筹备工作的手法，企图改变三大洲会议的反帝性质。他们竭力阻挠和排斥三洲真正反帝力量的代表出席这一次大会，甚至某些真正反帝组织的代表在克服了重重困难到达哈瓦那之后，仍被拒于会议大厅之外。
    在三洲会议开幕前夕，苏联、印度等代表在“自由哈瓦那”旅馆里串来串去，发起一次签名运动，要求在哈瓦那召开一次亚非人民团结组织执行委员会会议。据透露，他们打算就在这次会上提出“扩大”亚非人民团结组织，成立三洲组织。这意味着他们阴谋在哈瓦那为亚非人民团结组织举行“葬礼”。可是，这个征集签名运动很快就夭折了。
    中国代表团向亚非人民团结组织执委会成员国发出了一封信，坚决反对在三洲会议期间非法召开亚非人民团结组织执委会会议。这就挫败了苏、印代表的阴谋。
    大会开幕后，苏联代表团团长在大会发言中，正式提出建立三洲组织的主张。在小组委员会上，他们主张三洲各种群众组织都同苏联控制的世界和平理事会等国际组织“永远合作”，“紧密联系”。
    许多代表从加强三洲人民在反帝斗争中的团结出发，也希望建立一个三洲组织。但是，他们绝大多数不同意取消亚非人民团结组织。
    苏联、印度等少数代表坚持要在这次会议上作出决议，把亚非人民团结组织“扩大”为三洲组织。印度代表说，“小河流入大河，小河就没有存在的必要了！”许多代表对此加以驳斥。印度尼西亚代表驳斥说，如果说一个较大的区域性组织建立了，就必须取消较小地区的组织，那末，是否在非洲人民组织建立以后，阿拉伯联盟也要取消？在亚非新闻工作者协会成立后，泛非新闻工作者协会也就必须取消？
    中国代表指出，亚非人民团结组织近年来为亚非民族解放斗争作出了重大贡献。取消亚非人民团结组织，不仅会给亚非团结运动带来分裂，而且会给三洲团结运动带来严重威胁。
    大会组织委员会讨论的结果，拒绝了取消亚非人民团结组织的任何主张。苏联代表的企图再一次失败。
    苏联代表破坏亚非拉美团结的活动到大会闭幕前一天（十四日）达到新的高峰。他们不顾会议已经通过的决议，硬要挤进三洲组织执行书记处。在这之前，各国代表团已经在十三日分别开会，经过协商，产生了参加三洲会议决定成立的“亚、非、拉美人民团结组织执行书记处”的书记成员。亚洲四国的成员是：朝鲜、越南南方、巴基斯坦、叙利亚。到十四日举行的亚洲各国代表团团长会议上，苏联代表团突然提出要推翻已经协商产生的亚洲书记名单，并且毛遂自荐地说，“如果亚洲人民要苏联担负什么责任，苏联总是愿意担负的。”苏联代表团这一行动引起了亚洲各国代表团的公愤。老挝代表团团长冯维希一再提出质问：究竟十三日通过的名单是否算数？他并且坚持已经通过了的名单应当成为大会的决定。日本代表说，国际会议上从来没有过这样的先例，刚刚通过的决议就要推翻。从当天下午五点多钟一直到深夜一点多钟，苏联代表一直在亚洲书记名单问题上纠缠不休。在中国、日本、印度尼西亚、尼泊尔、柬埔寨、老挝、朝鲜、越南南方等代表齐声谴责的情况下，苏联代表终于被迫撤回了他的要求。
            结　束　语
    三洲大会是一场严肃的斗争。这是两条不同路线的斗争：是同以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义坚决斗争，还是同它们和平共处？是坚决支持越南人民把反对美帝侵略的人民战争进行到底，还是帮助美帝国主义推行“和谈”大阴谋？是坚决谴责和揭露美帝国主义的侵略工具联合国，还是为美苏在联合国拿三洲人民命运作交易的行径打掩护？是三大洲人民团结起来结成反对以美国为首的帝国主义的最广泛的统一战线，还是搞什么“联合行动”，把不断高涨的三大洲民族解放斗争纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道？是建立一个为赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团所控制的新组织来推行它的错误路线、取消有着八年反帝传统的亚非人民团结组织，还是在维护亚非人民团结组织和它的反帝传统的基础上推动三大洲人民的团结运动？
    斗争的结局表明，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在会上兜售的一套错误路线以及他们破坏亚非团结运动、控制三大洲团结运动的阴谋，在三大洲代表的共同努力下，碰得头破血流。他们假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的面目再一次大暴露，再一次从反面教育了三洲人民。
    三大洲人民团结运动，从一开始就碰到了种种暗礁。但是，按照三洲人民的意志，这个运动正以排山倒海的威力，冲垮一切暗礁，满怀信心地朝着反对以美国为首的帝国主义、争取民族解放的目标胜利前进。
