    Spirited and Heroic
    ——After Watching the Movie "Victory in Sight"
    Wu Jun
    The group film "Victory in Sight" (including three short plays: "Towards the North," "Victory in Sight," and "Welcoming the Dawn"), adapted from the play of the same name by the August First Film Studio, reflecting the anti-American struggle of the South Vietnamese people, is a film that inspires people to fight. Although it reflects only a few fragments of the great anti-American patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people, from it, we see the scene of the South Vietnamese people forging ahead, fighting bravely, and also share the joy of the South Vietnamese people frequently reporting victories and singing triumphant songs.
    This film has many successful aspects, the most important and moving of which is its reflection of the South Vietnamese people's fearless revolutionary heroism; it reflects the highly conscious South Vietnamese people's spirit of not fearing hardship or death, daring to struggle, daring to win, being good at struggle, and being good at winning.
    Let's look at the images of several protagonists in the film. The female liaison officer, A Zhen, is kind and resolute. Although she falls into the clutches of the enemy, she still cleverly completes the tasks assigned to her by her superiors. The enemy uses death to "scare" her, but she is not afraid. The enemy gouges out her eyes, but she is still not afraid. The enemy wants to cut out her tongue, but she is still not afraid. She is filled with the spirit of sacrificing her life for the revolutionary cause. Old guerrilla member Uncle Sang is enthusiastic, brave, and resourceful. To ensure the completion of the combat mission, he single-handedly holds up a battalion of the enemy. The enemy points a gun at him, but he does not change his expression. The enemy pulls out a dagger, but he remains calm. He fights the fully armed enemy with his bare hands, and he plays with the American bandits and their running dogs like he is playing with monkeys. The deputy director of the underground organization is an old worker who has experienced the hardships of struggle. He is unafraid in the face of danger. At a critical moment, he kills the special agent, ensuring the completion of the mission to attack the US military airport. From him, we see the heroic qualities of the working class. The image of the younger generation of South Vietnam is also very moving in the film. Whether it is the little rural girl A Xiu or the young factory workers A Cui or Er Tie, they have deep-seated hatred for the enemy. They are willing to go through fire and water to strike at the enemy. The author does not spend much ink on them, but their strong will to oppose the American aggressors leaves people with unforgettable impressions. After watching the film, these brilliant images are still active in front of our eyes, and their impassioned voices still resonate in our ears. These are not the images and voices of a few people, but the indomitable image of the fourteen million South Vietnamese people, and the voices of the fourteen million South Vietnamese people united in hatred against the enemy.
    This film also has unique features in its presentation. It is concise, clear, and easy to understand, making it easy to accept. Although it is composed of three short plays, each short play has its own theme, characters, and style, and when the three short plays come together, they are so harmonious, and in turn embody a general idea—no matter how brutal and crazy American imperialism is, the real power lies with the South Vietnamese people, not the American aggressors. The decadent American imperialism is bound to be defeated, and the South Vietnamese people are bound to win.
    Now, the "special war" of American imperialism in South Vietnam has completely gone bankrupt, and the "air and sea superiority" no longer works. The Americans are no longer acting as "advisers" but are personally fighting in the trenches. As the American imperialist war of aggression expands, it will fail even more miserably. The South Vietnamese people can not only annihilate the puppet troops on a large scale, but also aim their spears directly at the American aggressor troops. Faced with the excellent situation in South Vietnam today, faced with the fact that the South Vietnamese people have beaten the American aggressors to the point of exhaustion and have shaken the world, we hope that filmmakers can use the most powerful tool for educating the masses, the film, to clarify the truth of our time—that people's war can defeat American imperialism. We look forward to more excellent films reflecting the anti-American patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people appearing. (Attached image)

    气贯长虹
    ——电影《胜利在望》观后
    吴均
    八一电影制片厂根据同名话剧摄制的反映越南南方人民反美斗争的组剧《胜利在望》（包括《向北方》、《胜利在望》、《迎接曙光》三个短剧），是一部鼓舞人们斗争的影片。虽然它反映的只是越南南方人民伟大的反美爱国斗争中的几个片断，但是从这当中，我们看到了越南南方人民披荆斩棘、浴血奋战的场面，也分享了越南南方人民捷报频传、凯歌高奏的欢乐。
    这部影片有许多成功的地方，其中最主要的、也是最感动人的是它反映了越南南方人民大无畏的革命英雄主义精神；反映了有着高度觉悟的越南南方人民一不怕苦，二不怕死，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，善于斗争，善于胜利。
    让我们看看影片中的几个主人公的形象吧。女联络员阿贞，善良、刚毅，她虽然落入敌人的魔掌中，但是仍然机智地完成了上级交给她的任务。敌人用死“吓唬”她，她不怕，敌人挖掉她的眼睛，她仍然不怕，敌人要割她的舌头，她还是不怕。在她身上充满着为革命事业舍生忘死的精神。老游击队员桑大伯，热情勇敢，足智多谋，为了保证战斗任务的完成，他一人拖住了一个营的敌人。敌人用枪口对着他，他面不改色；敌人拔出了匕首，他泰然自若。他赤手空拳地同全副武装的敌人进行斗争，他就象耍猴儿一样，耍弄着美国强盗及其走狗。地下组织的领导者副厂长，是一个久经斗争风霜的老工人，他身居虎口，临危不惧，在关键的时刻，打死了特务，保证了袭击美军机场任务的完成。从他身上看到了工人阶级的英雄本色。越南南方青年一代的形象在影片中也是非常动人的，不论是农村的小姑娘阿秀，还是工厂的青年工人阿翠或二铁，他们对敌人有着刻骨的仇恨，他们为了打击敌人，赴汤蹈火在所不辞。作者在他们身上花的笔墨并不多，但是他们反对美国侵略者的坚强意志，给人们留下了不可忘怀的印象。看过影片以后，这些光辉的形象依然在眼前活跃，他们慷慨激昂的声音依然在耳边震响，这不是几个人的形象和声音，这是一千四百万越南南方人民威武不屈的形象，这是一千四百万越南南方人民同仇敌忾的声音。
    这部影片在表现形式上也有独到之处。它简练、明确、通俗易懂，看了容易接受。虽然是由三个短剧组成的，但是每个短剧有它自己的主题，人物和风格，而当三个短剧汇集在一起的时候，又是那样和谐，进而体现了一个总的思想——不管美帝国主义如何残暴、疯狂，真正强大的是越南南方人民而不是美国侵略者。腐朽的美帝国主义必败，越南南方人民必胜。
    现在，美帝国主义在越南南方的“特种战争”彻底破产了，“海空优势”也不灵了，美国佬已经不再是充当“顾问”而是亲自赤膊上阵了。随着美帝国主义侵略战争的扩大，它也就失败得更惨。越南南方人民不仅可以大规模地歼灭伪军，而且把矛头直指美国侵略军。面对着越南南方一片大好形势的今天，面对着越南南方人民把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额而威震全球的今天，我们希望电影工作者能够利用电影这个教育群众最强有力的工具来阐明我们时代的真理——用人民战争是可以打败美帝国主义的。我们期待着更加优秀的反映越南南方人民反美爱国斗争的影片出现。（附图片）
