    New Comrades Should Have a New Style
    New "soldiers" are being added to the revolutionary leading organs. This is a need for the development of our Party's great cause. Like Comrade Mei Dongkui of the Yanshi County Party Committee, who, for the sake of the Party's cause, does not allow personal distractions to interfere with his work, this spirit of strictly demanding oneself is a manifestation of the new style of new comrades.
    It is understandable that a "new soldier" feels that his level is low and his experience is shallow. Recognizing this point allows one to humbly learn leadership experience and leadership art from veteran comrades, so that one's work level changes from low to high, and one's experience changes from shallow to deep. However, only by removing personal selfishness and distractions, and putting down ideological baggage, can one move forward bravely, dare to shoulder heavy burdens, and familiarize oneself with what one is unfamiliar with at a faster pace. New comrades should bring fresh revolutionary vigor to the Party's leading organs, so as not to betray the trust and expectations of the Party and the people.
    These two submissions reflect, from one aspect, the spiritual state of some county committee comrades. In the process of revolutionization, the older generation must maintain revolutionary youthfulness forever, and the younger generation must have fresh vitality. Everyone should draw spiritual strength from Mao Zedong Thought, put down burdens, start the machinery, and our cause will surely achieve greater victories!

    新人要有新风
    新的“战士”正在补充到革命领导机关中来，这是我党伟大事业发展的需要。象偃师县委梅冬魁同志那样，为了党的事业，不让个人杂念掺杂到工作中来，这种严格要求自己的精神，是新人新风的表现。
    一个“新战士”感到自己水平低、阅历浅，这是可以理解的。认识到这一点，就能虚心向老同志学习领导经验和领导艺术，使自己的工作水平由低变高，自己的阅历由浅变深。但是，只有去除个人私心、杂念，放下思想包袱，才能使自己勇往直前，敢担重担，用较快的速度，熟悉自己所不熟悉的东西。新人应该把新鲜的革命的朝气带到党的领导机关里来，才不辜负党和人民的信任和期望。
    这两件来稿，从一个侧面反映了一些县委同志的精神状态的问题。在革命化过程中，年长的要永葆革命的青春，年轻的要有新鲜的活力，大家都在毛泽东思想里吸取精神力量，放下包袱，开动机器，我们的事业必将取得更大的胜利！
