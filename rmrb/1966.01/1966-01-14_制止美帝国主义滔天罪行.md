    Stop the Heinous Crimes of U.S. Imperialism
    Huang Wanli, Representative of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to China

    Recently, while spewing out "peace" smoke, U.S. imperialism blatantly used helicopters, grenade launchers, and "Mighty Mite" jets on January 2nd to spray various potent toxic gases in the Bao Zhai area of Long An Province near Saigon during a "sweep," massacring our innocent people. This heinous and outrageous crime of U.S. imperialism is a brutal trampling on universally recognized principles of international law, and also an exposure of the "peace" hoax that the Johnson administration is currently playing with. It thoroughly exposes the hypocritical face that U.S. imperialism is trying its best to disguise before the people of the world!

    In order to realize its conspiracy to turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base, U.S. imperialism has not only used all the latest weapons and modern warfare methods it possesses for eleven years, except for nuclear weapons, but has also openly and continuously used toxic gases and agents strictly prohibited by international conventions to suppress and massacre our southern compatriots.

    U.S. imperialism has long been implementing a so-called three-stage plan for the use of chemical agents in our south. The first stage of this plan is investigation and preparation. U.S. imperialism investigated the land and field conditions of both sides' combat areas and the people's liberated areas, and conducted aerial photography with reconnaissance aircraft. This stage was completed before December 20, 1961.

    The second stage is to carry out so-called "experiments" from a small scale to a large scale. In this stage, U.S. imperialism tested many different kinds of chemical agents in South Vietnam. In the last few months of 1961 alone, they released chemical agents eleven times in Binh Thuan, Binh Dinh, the suburbs of Da Nang, Phuc Thanh, Tay Ninh, Long Chuan and other provinces, poisoning 82 of our compatriots, killing many livestock, rotting 560 hectares of miscellaneous grains, and destroying 10,000 fruit trees. During this stage, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys used large amounts of highly concentrated toxic gases that are extremely harmful to the human body.

    On February 15, 1962, the Saigon radio station of U.S. imperialism's lackeys in South Vietnam clearly announced: "If the first batch of experiments yields satisfactory results, a large-scale plan will be implemented." In fact, the second stage of this plan had already begun in mid-1962.

    In 1962 alone, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys released chemical agents 40 times in various provinces of South Vietnam, killing 58 people, seriously poisoning 1,220 people, poisoning 448 cattle and tens of thousands of pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., and destroying 11,090 hectares of rice and fruit trees.

    U.S. imperialism has increasingly embarked on a path of crime in using chemical agents as a weapon of war. It not only continuously uses aircraft to release chemical agents into the villages where our compatriots live, but also secretly puts chemical agents into the drinking water and food of our people during sweeps, and into wells and water sources, in order to kill more people. In many sweeps in An Nhon Tay in Gia Dinh Province and Bei Lei in Tay Ninh Province, they also dispatched chemical troops to spray chemical agents, even asphyxiating gas, into the air-raid shelters and underground tunnels of the people.

    Even more barbaric, U.S. imperialism has massively released various crop-destroying insect eggs in cities in Can Tho Province and in rural areas such as Thạnh Phú and Ba Tri in Ben Tre Province, and used phosphorus incendiary bombs and asphyxiating gas.

    Since the beginning of last year, U.S. imperialism, which has fallen into a dead end in South Vietnam, has increasingly exposed its savage and brutal nature. It has shipped many tons of military toxic gas, including toxic gas that is extremely harmful to the human nervous system and the whole body, into South Vietnam. A massacre carried out by the U.S. aggressors on January 28 last year in Phu Lac Village, Hoa Hiep Commune, Tuy Hoa District, Phu Yen Province, with toxic gas shells, bombs, and napalm bombs resulted in the tragic death of more than 100 people, mostly women, the elderly, and children, and the burning of more than 1,000 houses. While dispatching B-57 jet bombers and B-52 strategic bombers to indiscriminately bomb our jungles and the villages of our compatriots with bombs and napalm bombs, U.S. imperialism has also stepped up the release of chemical agents in many places. Since June 20 last year, the U.S. aggressors have continuously released chemical agents in Duyen Hai and An Quới districts of Tra Vinh Province, poisoning more than 30,000 of our compatriots. In July, the U.S. bandits released chemical agents and carried out frenzied bombing in many villages in Phu Yen Province, massacring hundreds of people. Under the pretext of resisting the South Vietnamese Liberation Army's offensive, they used aircraft to release chemical agents, causing all the leaves of trees in the Bien Hoa and Duc Co areas to fall off. According to the United States Information Agency in Saigon, the amount of toxic gas and agents used by the United States in our south has approximately doubled every year since 1961: in 1963, chemical agents were released in an area of 300 square kilometers; in 1964, it increased to 500 square kilometers; last year, in the first seven months alone, the area of land in our south contaminated by chemical agents increased to 700 square kilometers. Obviously, the above figures have been greatly reduced, but this is enough to expose the heinous crimes of the U.S. bandits.

    On September 5 last year, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys sprayed toxic gas in Vinh Quang Village, 16 kilometers north of Qui Nhon; in October and November in the D liberated area and Tiểu Khê, Tây Ninh and other areas northwest of Saigon; in December in Bến Tre (where 40,000 people were poisoned in mid-January); in Cần Thơ (where 4,000 people were poisoned in one day); and on January 2 this year during the "sweep" near Saigon in spraying toxic gas in the Bao Zhai area of Long An Province. These have further deepened the unforgivable crimes committed by U.S. imperialism. Obvious facts make it clear that U.S. imperialism is resorting to any barbaric and brutal means in its efforts to save itself from its inevitable collapse in South Vietnam.

    U.S. imperialism's crimes of using toxic gas and chemical agents to massacre our compatriots in South Vietnam are numerous and undeniable. Long ago, the U.S. bandits and their lackeys openly declared: "Chemical poisons are a very effective means of warfare against communism." On March 23 last year, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara also admitted that U.S. imperialism had shipped toxic gas into South Vietnam as early as 1962. On March 24, Rusk also said very ambiguously: "Through the situation in South Vietnam, the shadow of toxic gas warfare has emerged." On the same day, The New York Times wrote very clearly: "In South Vietnam, white people have shipped in toxic gas and have decided to use it against Asians." On September 22, the U.S. Department of Defense once again blatantly announced, after the U.S. troops invading Vietnam used toxic gas in Vinh Quang Village to massacre our compatriots, that the commander of the U.S. troops invading Vietnam "has always had the right" to use toxic gas. In conjunction with this open clamor, the United States also sent the so-called "mobile research institute" belonging to its 406th Bacteriological and Chemical Warfare Task Force established in Sagamihara, Japan, to South Vietnam to carry out activities. All this has made people see more clearly the ambitions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, exposed the hypocritical face of the Johnson clique, and at the same time accused these heinous crimes that are hated and cursed by all people with conscience before world public opinion.

    The Vietnamese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world will never forget the crimes of U.S. imperialism in using toxic gas to kill people in South Vietnam. The people of the world are angrily condemning and strongly opposing the United States' disregard for international law and its use of toxic gas to massacre the people of South Vietnam. People, newspapers, and many international organizations from all countries, including the Chinese people and the American people, have severely condemned U.S. imperialism. On September 18, 1965, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement. Subsequently, many Chinese people's organizations, social organizations, and newspapers severely condemned U.S. imperialism for using toxic gas as a weapon of war and for plotting to use South Vietnam as a testing ground for chemical and bacteriological warfare. Recently, organizations such as the China Political Science and Law Society have issued statements strongly condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in using chemical agents and toxic gas on a large scale in South Vietnam.

    Obviously, U.S. imperialism is plotting and systematically using toxic gas and chemical agents to kill our people in South Vietnam. These conspiracies and actions are an extremely brutal and blatant trampling on the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam and the 1922 and 1925 international conventions on the prohibition of bacteriological and chemical weapons. The crimes of U.S. imperialism in using toxic gas and chemical agents in various parts of South Vietnam in the past and recently have exposed its extremely brutal, aggressive, and bellicose nature, and have thoroughly exposed its "peace" hoax. We once again severely accuse and condemn U.S. imperialism for the crimes of using toxic gas and chemical agents to massacre our compatriots. The people of South Vietnam urgently appeal to the people of the world and the fraternal Chinese people to severely condemn U.S. imperialism, and to take resolute actions to force them to stop using toxic gas and chemical agents as weapons of war, immediately withdraw their bacteriological and chemical warfare research institutions, and not to use our South Vietnam as a testing ground for these weapons of war.

    The U.S. aggressors vainly attempt to use toxic gas and other means of war to threaten the spirit and will of our southern people and force our people to submit. However, U.S. imperialism should know that no weapons or means of war can save them from their defeat in South Vietnam. The use of toxic gas and chemical agents by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys does not prove that they are strong. On the contrary, this is a reflection of their mental state of madness, fear, panic, and recklessness, and the manifestation of the mental state of a group of mad dogs tearing and biting wildly in an attempt to escape an inescapable predicament. We, the people of South Vietnam, will resolutely grasp the guns in our hands, aim at the enemy, and give them even heavier blows in order to stop their murderous claws of using toxic gas and avenge our compatriots!

    制止美帝国主义滔天罪行
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表　黄万里
    最近，美帝国主义在大放“和平”烟幕的同时，又明目张胆地在一月二日用直升飞机、榴弹枪和“迈蒂迈特”喷射机，在“扫荡”中对西贡附近的隆安省保寨地区大肆喷射多种烈性毒气，残杀我们无辜的人民。美帝国主义这种惨无人道、令人发指的滔天罪行，是对举世公认的国际法准则的粗暴践踏，也是对约翰逊政府目前正在大肆玩弄的“和平”骗局的揭露。它使美帝国主义正在千方百计装扮的伪善面目在世界人民面前被彻底戳穿！
    美帝国主义为了实现把越南南方变成为它的殖民地和军事基地的阴谋，十一年来不仅使用了它所拥有的除核武器以外的一切最新式武器和现代战争手段，而且还公然不断地使用了为国际公约所严格禁止的毒气、毒剂，镇压和屠杀我们的南方同胞。
    美帝国主义很久以来，就在我国南方执行着一个使用化学毒剂的所谓三阶段计划。这一计划的头一阶段，就是调查和准备。美帝国主义调查了双方作战地区和解放区人民的土地和田园状况，并以侦察机在空中进行了摄影。这一阶段已在一九六一年十二月二十日以前完成。
    第二阶段是进行从小范围至大范围的所谓“试验”，在这个阶段，美帝国主义在越南南方试用了许多不同种类的化学毒剂。仅在一九六一年最后几个月，他们就在平顺、平定、岘港郊区、福成、西宁、隆川等省份撒放化学毒剂十一次。使我们的八十二个同胞中毒，许多牲畜死亡，五百六十公顷杂粮腐烂，一万株果树被毁。在这个阶段，美帝国主义及其走狗使用了大量高浓度的对人体危害极大的各种毒气。
    一九六二年二月十五日，美帝国主义在南越的走狗的西贡电台就曾清楚地宣布：“要是头一批试验获得完满的结果的话，就将执行一个大规模的计划。”其实，这个计划的第二阶段早在一九六二年年中就已经开始。
    仅在一九六二年，美帝国主义及其走狗就在南越各省撒放化学毒剂四十次，使五十八人死亡，一千二百二十人严重中毒，毒死四百四十八头牛和成万只猪、鸡、鸭等，并且使一万一千零九十公顷水稻和果木被毁。
    在以化学毒剂作为战争工具方面，美帝国主义日益严重地走上了罪恶的道路，它不仅连续使用飞机把化学毒剂撒放到我们同胞居住的村庄，而且还在他们去扫荡时，偷偷地把化学毒剂投放到我们人民的饮用水和食物中，投放到水井里和水源里，以杀害更多的人民。在对嘉定省的安仁西和西宁省的贝累等许多次扫荡中，他们还出动了化学部队，以喷射器把化学毒剂甚至窒息性毒气喷入人民群众的防空壕和地洞里。
    更加野蛮的是，美帝国主义竟在芹苴省的城市和槟椥省的盛富、巴知等地乡村，大量投放各种毁坏庄稼的害虫虫卵，并使用了磷燃烧弹和窒息性毒气。
    从去年年初起，在南越已陷入死胡同的美帝国主义，更加日益暴露出它野蛮残暴的本性。它把许多吨军用毒气，其中包括对于人的神经系统和全身危害极大的毒气运进南越。去年一月二十八日，美国侵略者在富安省绥和县和协乡富乐村用毒气弹、炸弹和凝固汽油弹进行的一次大屠杀，就使一百多人，大部分是妇女、老人和儿童惨死，一千多间房屋被烧毁。在出动B—57型喷气轰炸机和B—52型战略轰炸机用炸弹和凝固汽油弹滥炸我们的丛林和同胞们的村庄的同时，美帝国主义还在许多地方加紧撒放化学毒剂。去年六月二十日起，美国侵略者在茶荣省缘海、昂桥两县连续撒放化学毒剂，就使我们的三万多个同胞中毒。七月间，美国强盗又在富安省的许多乡村撒放化学毒剂和进行狂轰滥炸，屠杀了数以百计的群众。他们借口抗击南越解放军的进攻而用飞机撒放化学毒剂，使边和、德基地区的树叶全部脱落。据美国新闻署在西贡的机构透露，从一九六一年以来，每年美国在我们南方使用的毒气和毒剂约增加一倍：一九六三年有三百平方公里地方被撒放化学毒剂；一九六四年增加至五百平方公里；去年，仅在头七个月，我们南方被化学毒剂污染的土地面积就增加至七百平方公里。显然，上述数字是被大大缩小了的，但是这也足以揭露了美国强盗的滔天罪行。
    去年九月五日，美帝国主义及其走狗在归仁以北十六公里的荣光村，十、十一月在西贡西北的D解放区和小河、西宁等地区，十二月在槟椥（一月中四万人中毒）、芹苴（一天中四千人中毒），以及今年一月二日在西贡附近的“扫荡”中对隆安省保寨地区喷射毒气等，都进一步加深了美帝国主义犯下的天地不容的罪恶。明显的事实使人清楚地看到，美帝国主义在竭力挽救它在越南南方无法避免的崩溃时，是不择任何野蛮残暴的手段的。
    美帝国主义在越南南方使用毒气和化学毒剂屠杀我们的同胞，罪行累累，不容抵赖。很久以前美国强盗及其走狗就公开宣称：“化学毒药是反对共产主义极为有效的一种战争手段”。去年三月二十三日，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉也曾承认，美帝国主义在一九六二年就已把毒气运进越南南方。三月二十四日，腊斯克也十分暧昧地说：“通过南越的事态，已经出现了毒气战争的黯影。”同一天，《纽约时报》则十分明确地写道：“在南越，白种人已经运进了毒气，并且已经决定以它来反对亚洲人。”九月二十二日，美国国防部在侵越美军在荣光村使用毒气屠杀我们同胞后，又一次明目张胆地宣布，侵越美军司令“一直有权”使用毒气。与这种公开叫嚣的同时，美国又把属于它在日本相模原成立的第四○六细菌和化学战争工作队的所谓“机动研究所”派到越南南方去活动。所有这一切，都使人更加看清了美帝国主义及其走狗的野心，揭穿了约翰逊集团假仁假义的面目，同时在世界舆论面前控诉了这些为所有具有良知的人们都仇恨和诅咒的滔天罪行。
    越南人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民绝不会忘记美帝国主义在越南南方使用毒气杀人的罪行。世界人民正在愤怒地谴责并强烈地反对美国不顾国际公法而用毒气来残杀越南南方人民、包括中国人民、美国人民在内的世界各国人民、报刊和许多国际组织，都严厉谴责美帝国主义。一九六五年九月十八日，中华人民共和国外交部曾发表声明，接着，中国许多人民团体、社会组织和报刊，都严厉谴责美帝国主义用毒气作为战争工具和阴谋以南越作为化学战和细菌战的试验场。最近，中国政法学会等组织又发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南南方大规模地使用化学毒剂和毒气的滔天罪行。
    显然，美帝国主义正阴谋并系统地以毒气和化学毒剂来杀害我们越南南方人民。这些阴谋和行动是对一九五四年关于越南的日内瓦协议和一九二二、一九二五年关于禁止细菌武器、化学武器的国际公约的极其粗暴的公然践踏。美帝国主义过去和最近在越南南方各地使用毒气和化学毒剂的罪行，暴露了它极端残暴的侵略、好战的本质。使它的“和平”骗局被彻底戳穿。我们再一次严厉控诉和谴责美帝国主义用毒气和化学毒剂屠杀我们同胞的罪行。越南南方人民迫切地呼吁世界人民和兄弟的中国人民严厉谴责美帝国主义，并以坚决的行动来迫使他们停止以毒气和化学毒剂作为战争手段，立即撤走他们的细菌战和化学战的研究机构，并且不得以我们越南南方作为这些战争手段的试验场。
    美国侵略者妄想用毒气和其它战争手段威胁我们南方人民的精神和意志，迫使我们的人民屈服。但是，美帝国主义应该知道，没有任何武器和战争工具能够挽救他们在南越的失败。美帝国主义及其走狗使用毒气和化学毒剂，并不能证明它们强大。相反，这是他们疯狂、恐惧、慌乱、妄为的心理状态的反映，是妄图逃避无法摆脱的绝境的一群疯狗所作的狂撕乱咬的心理状态的表现。我们越南南方人民坚决紧握手中枪，对准敌人，给予他们以更加沉重的打击，以便制止他们用毒气杀人的魔掌，并为我们的同胞们报仇！
