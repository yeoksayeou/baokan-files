    Our Argument
    Recently, we have focused on discussing the question of "serving whom?". Some comrades said: "Our cadres serve the people, and the question of whom we serve has long been resolved." Some comrades said: "It's been over a dozen years since liberation. If we say that the question of whom we serve has not been resolved, it doesn't make sense logically, and it's difficult to understand ideologically." However, some comrades believe that the main reason for the lack of thorough revolutionization in the past is that the fundamental question of "serving whom" has not been resolved. Some comrades cited examples, saying: We sit in the office, do not go deep to understand the actual situation, and only rely on publishing reports and making phone calls to ask for information from below. Who is serving whom in this case? Some people pointed out: When cadres in the county go to the countryside, they make a big circle from one commune to another for ten days and a half, and then they complete their "task." Can this be said to be serving the people?
    After repeated discussions, everyone realized that although these problems do not exist in everyone, they are not just individual problems, and the crux of whether people have achieved ideological revolutionization lies here. To thoroughly achieve ideological revolutionization, we must first solve the problem of "serving whom," otherwise talking about revolutionization is just empty talk.

    我们的一场争论
    最近我们着重讨论了“为谁服务”的问题。有的同志说：“我们干部就是为人民服务的，为谁服务的问题早就解决了。”有的同志说：“解放十几年了，如果说我们为谁服务的问题还没有解决，道理上讲不通，思想上也想不通。”有的同志却认为，过去没有彻底革命化的主要原因，就是因为“为谁服务”的这个根本问题没有得到解决。有的同志例举说：我们坐在机关，不深入了解实际情况，只靠发表报、打电话向下边要情况，这是谁为谁服务呢？有的人提出：县里的干部下乡，从这个公社到那个公社，转上一大圈十天半月，就完成“任务”了。这能说是为人民服务吗？
    大家反复讨论，最后认识到这些问题虽然不是人人都有，但也不是个别人的问题，人们有没有实现思想革命化的症结就在这里。要彻底实现思想革命化，首先必须解决“为谁服务”的问题，不然讲革命化就只是空谈。
