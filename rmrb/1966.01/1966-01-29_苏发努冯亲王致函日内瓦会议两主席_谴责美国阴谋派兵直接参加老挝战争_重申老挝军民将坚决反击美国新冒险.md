    XINHUA, Kang Kai, 27th – According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 27th: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao National Union Government, in a letter written on January 15 to the Co-Chairmen of the 1961-1962 Geneva Conference on the Laotian Question, condemned the US imperialists and their lackeys for initiating a conspiracy to introduce US troops into Laos to directly participate in the war, in order to realize their scheme of expanding the war of aggression to the entire Indochinese peninsula.
    The letter pointed out that recently, US imperialists launched a peace offensive to cover up their plans to increase US troops to intensify the aggression against South Vietnam and further provoke and intimidate the Kingdom of Cambodia. At the same time, they are carrying out conspiratorial activities in Laos, and it can be determined that they are doing everything possible to realize their plan to introduce US troops into Laos, with the US military directly occupying central and lower Laos, attempting to turn this region into a bridgehead connecting the South Vietnamese battlefield with the base in Thailand, with the aim of expanding their war of aggression to the entire Indochina.
    The letter said that in order to realize these sinister plans, as early as the end of 1964 and the beginning of the dry season of 1965, the Lao right-wing army, under the instigation of US imperialists and directly commanded by US military advisors, coordinated with the Thai army in launching many large-scale incursions into the areas of the Laotian Patriotic Front-controlled provinces of Khammouane and Savannakhet. These military operations have been completely crushed by the patriotic military and civilians of the area. However, the US imperialists and their lackeys will never give up their malicious conspiracies.
    The letter pointed out that the danger of this kind of adventure is even more obvious, especially after the visit of US Secretary of Defense McNamara to Saigon at the end of November 1965. Since then, the Washington ruling clique has been openly clamoring to send US troops to Laos in order to directly participate in the war.
    Prince Souphanouvong said in the letter that the Lao right-wing, in accordance with the intentions of US imperialists, is implementing the above-mentioned new military plan, gathering multiple mobile units in central and lower Laos, and constantly invading the areas controlled by the Lao Patriotic Front. At the same time, the Lao right-wing has also continuously dispatched many intelligence and commando teams of “special forces” organized, equipped and directly commanded by US imperialists to the above-mentioned areas to collect intelligence, create incidents and disturbances. Not only that, but the jet planes of the US Air Force and the planes of the Saigon puppet government are bombing the liberated areas every day, especially the provinces of Khammouane, Savannakhet, Saravane and Attopeu (of central and lower Laos), dropping thousands of tons of bombs, including napalm bombs, and spreading chemical poisons, causing harm to many people and causing huge material losses to local residents.
    The letter pointed out that the above-mentioned facts fully expose the ferocious features of US imperialist aggressors. They deliberately sabotaged the declaration on the neutrality of Laos signed by the US government, trampling on the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Laos. By doing so, they have made the already serious situation in Laos even more complicated, and seriously threatened the security of Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.
    Prince Souphanouvong said that in the name of the Lao Patriotic Front, I expose and strongly condemn the US imperialists who are preparing to send US troops to Laos to directly participate in combat, in order to achieve their goal of expanding the war of aggression to the entire Indochinese peninsula. I demand that they unconditionally stop all acts of interference and aggression against Laos, especially the conspiracy to send US troops to directly occupy central and lower Laos, and demand that they immediately stop bombing the liberated areas of Laos. I urgently request the two chairmen to condemn the conspiracy of the US imperialists to send US troops to directly participate in the fighting in Laos, and request the two chairmen to take effective measures to prevent this conspiracy from succeeding, and at the same time force the US imperialists and their lackeys to correctly observe and implement the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian Question.
    Prince Souphanouvong finally reiterated: The Laotian question can only be resolved in accordance with the four-point position and five-point solution in the October 13, 1965 declaration of the Lao National Political Consultative Conference. If the US imperialists and their lackeys insist on carrying out new military adventures and expanding the war of aggression to Laos, the Lao patriotic forces and all the Lao people will have no choice but to take various corresponding actions to counterattack, and the US imperialists and their lackeys must bear responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    苏发努冯亲王致函日内瓦会议两主席
    谴责美国阴谋派兵直接参加老挝战争
    重申老挝军民将坚决反击美国新冒险
    新华社康开二十七日电　据巴特寮电台二十七日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王在一月十五日写给一九六一——一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议两主席的信中，谴责美帝国主义者及其仆从已经着手推行把美国军队引进老挝直接参战以实现它的把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那半岛的阴谋。
    信件指出，最近，美帝国主义者发动和平攻势，来掩盖他们增派美军加紧侵略南越，进一步对柬埔寨王国进行挑衅和恐吓的计划。同时还在老挝进行阴谋活动，可以断定，他们正千方百计地企图实现把美国军队引入老挝的计划，由美军直接占领中寮和下寮地区，妄图把这个地区变成把南越战场同泰国的基地连结起来的桥头堡，其目的就是把他们的侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。
    信件说，为了实现这些阴险的计划，早在一九六四年年底和一九六五年旱季开始，老挝右派军队在美帝国主义者的唆使下，由美国军事顾问直接指挥，就配合泰国军队，多次大规模进犯老挝爱国战线党控制下的甘蒙省和沙湾拿吉省地区，这些军事行动已经完全为当地的爱国军民所粉碎。然而美帝国主义者及其仆从是决不会放弃他们的恶毒阴谋的。
    信件指出，特别是在美国国防部长麦克纳马拉一九六五年十一月底访问西贡后，这种冒险的危险性更加明显了。从那时以后，华盛顿统治集团一直公开叫嚷派美国军队进驻老挝，以便直接参战。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中说，老挝右派按照美帝国主义者的意旨，执行上述新的军事计划，在中寮和下寮地区集结了多批机动部队，并且不断进犯老挝爱国战线党所控制的地区。同时，老挝右派还不断向上述地区派出许多由美帝国主义者组织、装备和直接指挥的“特种部队”的谍报队和别动队，搜集情报，制造事端和骚乱。不仅如此，美国空军的喷气式飞机和西贡傀儡政府的飞机，每天对解放区，特别是（中下寮的）甘蒙省、沙湾拿吉省、沙拉湾省和阿速坡省滥施轰炸，投下数以千吨计的炸弹，其中包括凝固汽油弹，并且撒放化学毒剂，使许多人受害，并使当地居民遭受巨大的物质损失。
    信件指出，上述种种事实使美帝国主义侵略者的狰狞面目暴露无遗。他们蓄意破坏了美国政府签了字的关于老挝中立的宣言，践踏老挝的主权、独立和领土完整。他们这样作，就使已经严重的老挝局势变得更加复杂，使印度支那和东南亚各国的安全受到严重的威胁。
    苏发努冯亲王说，我以老挝爱国战线党的名义揭露和强烈谴责美帝国主义者正在准备把美军派往老挝，在那里直接参加战斗，以实现他们把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那半岛的目的。我要求他们无条件地停止对老挝的一切干涉和侵略行径，特别是派美军直接占领老挝中寮和下寮地区的阴谋，要求他们立即停止轰炸老挝解放区。我迫切要求两主席谴责美帝国主义者派美军直接参加在老挝的战斗的阴谋，并且要求两主席采取有效措施以使这种阴谋不能得逞，同时迫使美帝国主义者及其走狗正确遵守和执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    苏发努冯亲王最后重申：只能根据一九六五年十月十三日老挝全国政治协商会议宣言中的四点立场和五项解决办法来解决老挝问题。如果美帝国主义者及其走狗硬要进行新的军事冒险，把侵略战争扩大到老挝，老挝爱国力量和全体老挝人民就不得不采取各种相应的行动进行反击，美帝国主义者及其走狗必须对由此而产生的一切后果承担责任。
