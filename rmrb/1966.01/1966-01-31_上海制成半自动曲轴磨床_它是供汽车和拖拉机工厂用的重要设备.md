    Shanghai Makes Semi-Automatic Crankshaft Grinder
    It is an Important Equipment for Automobile and Tractor Factories
    An important equipment for automobile and tractor factories – a semi-automatic crankshaft grinder – has been manufactured at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. This grinder can perform semi-automatic cycles when grinding crankshafts. After automatically grinding one section, it can grind another, and it can automatically measure and automatically correct the grinding wheel.
    The working efficiency of this grinder is one to two times higher than that of the general crankshaft grinders originally produced by the factory, and the labor intensity for workers during operation is also relatively low.

    上海制成半自动曲轴磨床
    它是供汽车和拖拉机工厂用的重要设备
    供汽车和拖拉机工厂用的重要设备——半自动曲轴磨床，在上海机床厂制成。这种磨床在磨削曲轴的时候，能作半自动循环。它能在自动磨完一段以后，再磨另一段，而且能自动进行测量和自动修正砂轮。
    这种磨床的工作效率比本厂原来生产的一般曲轴磨床高出一到两倍，操作时工人劳动强度也比较低。
