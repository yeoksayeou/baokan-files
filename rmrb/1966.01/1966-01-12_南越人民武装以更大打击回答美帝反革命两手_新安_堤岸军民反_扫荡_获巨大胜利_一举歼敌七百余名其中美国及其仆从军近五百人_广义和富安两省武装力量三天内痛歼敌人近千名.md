    HANOI, January 11 (Xinhua) – According to the latest war report released by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of New An-Di An in South Vietnam, from December 31st of last year to January 7th of this year, heroically countered the large-scale “sweeping” of two regimental combat teams of the U.S.-puppet army and the Australian and New Zealand mercenary troops, achieving a great victory by annihilating more than 700 enemy troops, including nearly 500 U.S. aggressors and U.S. mercenary troops, shooting down eight enemy aircraft, and seizing a large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.
    This is the battle in which the New An-Di An military and civilians annihilated the most U.S. aggressor troops.
    On December 31st of last year, the Liberation Armed Forces engaged in a bayonet charge with a puppet army paratrooper regiment in Tay My Qui commune, Duc Hue district, annihilating 200 enemy troops, including two U.S. commanders. On January 1st of this year, three puppet army paratrooper battalions, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, invaded Dong My Thanh commune, Duc Hue district. The local guerrillas immediately intercepted them heroically, killing 50 enemy troops.
    On January 2nd, the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade and the Australian and New Zealand mercenary troops, with the puppet army leading the way, launched a multi-pronged “sweeping” operation in Duc Hoa district and Hoa Khanh commune. The Liberation Army and guerrillas continuously repelled the enemy’s attacks, annihilating more than 300 U.S. and mercenary troops.
    The enemy, having suffered heavy casualties repeatedly, became very frightened and hastily concentrated their forces at some defense points. On the afternoon of January 6th, at 5:00 PM, the Liberation Armed Forces again attacked the U.S. bandits stationed in Hoa Khanh commune, annihilating more than 50 enemy troops. At noon on January 7th, when the enemy was preparing to retreat, the Liberation Armed Forces launched a second fierce attack on this group of U.S. bandits, annihilating more than 100 enemy troops.
    The Liberation News Agency also reported that on December 27th of last year, the guerrillas of Song Chinh village and Thuan Phong village, Cat Hiep commune, Phu Cat district, Binh Dinh province, defeated the "sweeping" of a battalion of U.S. troops, killing 101 U.S. aggressor troops, shooting down four U.S. helicopters, and damaging five.
    In the Phuc Thanh area north of Bien Hoa province, the military and civilians annihilated 1,027 enemy troops in November and December of last year, including more than 900 U.S. aggressor troops and Australian mercenary troops.
    HANOI, January 10 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Ngai and Phu Yen provinces in South Vietnam launched fierce attacks on the enemy at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, annihilating nearly 1,000 enemy troops in just three days of fighting.
    On December 28th of last year, the Quang Ngai Provincial Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Minh Long district, destroying the enemy’s defense system, smashing the enemy’s command post, killing and wounding 260 enemy troops, and capturing 160. The entire 712th "Security Force" of the puppet army was wiped out. On the same night, the Liberation Armed Forces launched attacks on the enemy guarding two bridges on the So River and the Ve River, quickly annihilating more than a company of the puppet "Security Force."
    On the evening of December 31st, the Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated a company of the puppet "Security Force" in a surprise attack.
    In these two days of fighting, the Quang Ngai Provincial Liberation Armed Forces, in addition to annihilating a large number of enemy troops, also liberated 25,000 residents in six communes of Minh Long district.
    On January 1st, a battalion of South Korean mercenary troops and three battalions of South Vietnamese puppet troops, under the cover of aircraft and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, went to Hoa Xuan commune, Tuy Hoa district, Phu Yen province, to conduct a “sweeping” operation. The local Liberation Armed Forces immediately gave them a head-on blow, completely annihilating two companies of South Korean mercenary troops in one fell swoop.
