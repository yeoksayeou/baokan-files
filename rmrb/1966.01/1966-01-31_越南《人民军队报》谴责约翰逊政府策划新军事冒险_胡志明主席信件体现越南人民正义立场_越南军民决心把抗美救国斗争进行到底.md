    Vietnam’s "People's Army Daily" Condemns the Johnson Administration for Plotting New Military Adventures
    President Ho Chi Minh's Letter Embodies the Just Stand of the Vietnamese People
    Vietnamese Army and People Determined to Carry the Anti-American National Salvation Struggle Through to the End
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 30th: Vietnam’s "People's Army Daily" published an editorial on January 30th regarding President Ho Chi Minh’s letter to the heads of many countries on January 24th, stating that the entire Vietnamese army and people must fulfill the nation's glorious mission and carry the anti-American national salvation struggle through to complete victory.
    The editorial said that under the iron heel of the American invading army, the people of South Vietnam have not experienced a single day of true peace, nor can they have true freedom. Under the circumstances of U.S. imperialism’s brutal trampling on the sacred rights of the Vietnamese nation, the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, stood up, took up arms, and resolutely resisted the war of aggression of U.S. imperialism to defend the motherland, defend the Geneva Accords, and defend peace. This is the Vietnamese people's completely legitimate right of self-defense.
    The editorial said that the Vietnamese people's struggle has only one purpose: to have U.S. imperialism respect Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity; to have U.S. imperialism stop its aggression, strictly abide by the Geneva Accords, withdraw its troops from Vietnam, and let the people of South Vietnam resolve their own internal affairs in accordance with the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.
    The editorial said that the Vietnamese people's stance radiates the light of justice. U.S. imperialism fears justice like an owl fears the sun. Whether in words or in actions, the United States not only refuses to recognize the four-point position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but also uses every vicious conspiracy to distort right and wrong. But all the conspiracies and means of the United States will ultimately fail, because justice is on the side of the Vietnamese people. The united front of world people supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and the launching of war is developing widely and deeply, including the American people who are opposing the American government's policy of aggression and war. The editorial expressed firm belief that the just stance of the Vietnamese people, embodied in President Ho Chi Minh's letter to the heads of many countries, will enable the world's people to more forcefully support the Vietnamese people's cause of anti-American national salvation.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th: Vietnam’s "People's Army Daily" published an observer article on January 28th, condemning the Johnson administration for stubbornly adhering to its policy of aggression against Vietnam and plotting new military adventures.
    The article pointed out that the American aggressors are being soundly defeated on the battlefield, yet they are still resorting to hooligan tactics, brazenly threatening the Vietnamese people that if they do not accept American aggression, they will be destroyed. The United States is stepping up preparations for new bombings of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The article emphasized that what is the true standard of America's "peaceful sincerity" in resolving the Vietnam problem? If the United States sincerely respects the Geneva Accords, it must stop its aggression and withdraw U.S. troops from South Vietnam. If the United States sincerely desires peace, it must recognize the sole genuine representative of the people of South Vietnam—the South Vietnam National Liberation Front—and negotiate with the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. If the United States sincerely respects the South Vietnamese people’s right to self-determination, it must allow the South Vietnamese people to realize the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. If the United States sincerely hopes for a political solution, it must recognize the four-point position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, embody it in its actual actions, and permanently and unconditionally cease the bombing of the North.
    The article said that by comparing the words and deeds of U.S. imperialism, it can be clearly seen that it has absolutely no sincerity whatsoever.

    越南《人民军队报》谴责约翰逊政府策划新军事冒险
    胡志明主席信件体现越南人民正义立场
    越南军民决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底
    据新华社河内三十日电  越南《人民军队报》三十日就胡志明主席一月二十四日给许多国家首脑的信件发表社论说，越南全军全民一定要完成民族的光荣使命，把抗美救国斗争进行到完全胜利为止。
    社论说，在美国侵略军的铁蹄下，越南南方人民不曾有过一天真正的和平，也不可能有真正的自由。在美帝国主义粗暴地蹂躏越南民族的神圣权利的情况下，越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下站起来，拿起武器，坚决抗击美帝国主义的侵略战争，保卫祖国，保卫日内瓦协议，保卫和平。这是越南人民完全正当的自卫权利。
    社论说，越南人民的斗争的目的只有一个：要美帝国主义尊重越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，要美帝国主义停止侵略，严格履行日内瓦协议，从越南撤出军队，由越南南方人民按照越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领自己解决自己的内部事务。
    社论说，越南人民的立场放射着正义的光辉。美帝国主义象猫头鹰怕太阳一样害怕正义。无论是在言论上或是在行动上，美国不但不承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，而且还用尽一切恶毒阴谋来颠倒是非。但是美国的一切阴谋和手段终将归于失败，因为正义在越南人民一边。世界人民支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和发动战争的斗争的统一战线正在广泛和深入地发展，包括美国人民在内都在反对美国政府的侵略政策和战争政策。社论表示坚信：体现在胡志明主席给许多国家首脑的信件中的越南人民的正义立场，将使世界人民更加有力地支持越南人民的抗美救国事业。
    据新华社河内二十九日电越南《人民军队报》二十八日发表观察家文章，谴责约翰逊政府顽固地坚持侵略越南的政策并策划进行新的军事冒险。
    文章指出，美国侵略者在战场上正被打得一败涂地，却还在耍流氓手段，悍然恫吓越南人民说，如果越南人民不接受美国的侵略，那么就将遭到破坏。美国正在加紧准备对越南民主共和国进行新的轰炸。
    文章强调说，在解决越南问题上对于美国的“和平诚意”的真正标准是什么呢？如果美国真诚的尊重日内瓦协议，就必须停止侵略，必须把美军撤出越南南方。如果美国真诚地希望和平，就必须承认越南南方人民的唯一真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线，并同越南南方民族解放阵线进行谈判。如果美国真诚的尊重南越人民的自决权，就必须让南越人民实现越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领。如果美国真诚的希望有一个政治解决办法，就必须承认越南民主共和国的四项主张，并在自己的实际行动中体现出来，必须永远和无条件地停止对北方的轰炸。
    文章说，对照美帝国主义的言行，就可以清楚地看出，它完全没有丝毫的诚意。
