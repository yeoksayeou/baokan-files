    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and its Connection to the "Individual Farming Trend" and the "Reversal-of-Verdict Trend"
    Jiang Ping
    In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han listed a timetable of his writing, stating: "My research on Hai Rui took place in the two years of 1959 and 1960." This is merely an attempt to deny that his historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is connected to the "individual farming trend" and the "reversal-of-verdict trend."
      This defense is untenable. Although the "individual farming trend" and the "reversal-of-verdict trend" were most rampant in 1961, they actually began in 1959. Even as early as 1957, these two erroneous trends had already appeared. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," published in February 1957: "Now some people are saying that collectivization is no good, that collectivization has no advantages, and a small typhoon has blown in." He also said: "Some people do not understand that our policies today are suitable for today's circumstances, that the policies of the past were suitable for the circumstances of the past, and they want to use today's policies to overturn past cases, to negate the great achievements of past suppression of counterrevolutionaries. This is completely wrong, and it is not allowed by the masses of the people." From these two passages, we can clearly see that the "individual farming trend" and the "reversal-of-verdict trend" did indeed exist at that time. However, because the Party and the people of the whole country carried out the "Rectification Campaign" and the struggle against the "Rightists," the ideological consciousness of the broad masses was generally raised, and this erroneous trend was promptly struck down.
    In 1958, the whole country implemented the "Great Leap Forward," the situation was excellent, and the erroneous trend naturally could not raise its head.
    However, from 1959 to 1962, when our country encountered temporary economic difficulties, imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism launched an anti-China high tide, and domestic class enemies also launched an attack on socialism, the class struggle was very acute. At that time, some people advocated "individual farming" and clamored for "reversal of verdicts" to oppose our general line of socialist construction.
    It can be seen that the "individual farming trend" and the "reversal-of-verdict trend" existed continuously from 1959 to 1962. How can it be said that the content of the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is "as unrelated as a horse's head and a cow's horns" to the "individual farming trend" and the "reversal-of-verdict trend" at that time?

### 《海瑞罢官》和“单干风”、“翻案风”有联系

    《海瑞罢官》和“单干风”、“翻案风”有联系
    姜平
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中列了一张他自己的写作时间表，声明说：“我研究海瑞，是在一九五九年、一九六○年两年中的事。”这无非是想否认他的历史剧《海瑞罢官》与“单干风”和“翻案风”有联系。
      这个辩解是站不住脚的。“单干风”、“翻案风”虽然是在一九六一年刮得最厉害，但它实际上在一九五九年就开始了。甚至早在一九五七年，这两股歪风就已经出现。毛泽东同志在一九五七年二月发表的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中曾指出：“现在有一些人却在说合作化不行，合作化没有优越性，吹来了一股小台风。”又说：“有些人不了解我们今天的政策适合于今天的情况，过去的政策适合于过去的情况，想利用今天的政策去翻过去的案，想否定过去肃反工作的巨大成绩，这是完全错误的，这是人民群众所不允许的。”从这两段话里，我们清楚地看到了当时确实存在过“单干风”和“翻案风”。不过，后来由于党和全国人民开展了“整风运动”和“反右派”斗争，广大群众的思想觉悟普遍提高，这股歪风遭到了及时的打击。
    一九五八年，全国实行了“大跃进”，形势大好，歪风当然也不能抬头。
    但是，一九五九年到一九六二年，在我国经济遇到暂时困难，帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义发动了反华高潮，国内的阶级敌人也向社会主义发动进攻，阶级斗争十分尖锐。当时，有些人鼓吹“单干”，叫嚷“翻案”，来同我们的社会主义建设总路线相对抗。
    可见，“单干风”和“翻案风”从一九五九年至一九六二年是一直存在的，怎么能够说《海瑞罢官》这个剧本的内容和当时的“单干风”、“翻案风”是“风马牛不相及”呢？
