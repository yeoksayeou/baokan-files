    Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: Wen Chi, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Youth Federation, and Hayashi Teruo, Head of the Delegation of the Japan Youth Association Council participating in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally, today signed a memorandum of understanding.
    The following is the full text of the minutes:
    Wen Chi, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Youth Federation, and Hayashi Teruo, Head of the Delegation of the Japan Youth Association Council participating in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally, along with Vice-Head Hojo Norihiko, Secretary-General Mizuno Mitsushiro, etc., held talks on the issue of friendly relations between the All-China Youth Federation and the Japan Youth Association Council. The minutes are as follows:
    Hayashi Teruo, Head of the Delegation of the Japan Youth Association Council, stated that in order to enhance Sino-Japanese friendship, the Japan Youth Association Council invites the All-China Youth Federation to send a ten-member delegation to Japan for a three-week visit in May 1966. This is the wish of the Delegation and all members of the Japan Youth Association Council. It is hoped that this wish can be realized soon. At the same time, the Japan Youth Association Council will actively participate in the Preparatory Committee jointly established by Japanese youth organizations to invite the All-China Youth Federation delegation to visit Japan and participate in the welcome preparations; it is willing to contribute its strength in this regard.
    Wen Chi, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Youth Federation, stated that the Chinese youth are willing to continuously strengthen and develop the unity and friendly relations between the peoples and youth of China and Japan. Based on this desire, the All-China Youth Federation is willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with various youth organizations in Japan, including the Japan Youth Association Council. In recent years, some problems have arisen in the friendly exchanges with the Japan Youth Association Council. While establishing friendly relations with the All-China Youth Federation, the Japan Youth Association Council also sent a delegation to Taiwan. Later, when a Chinese youth delegation visited Japan and the Japan Youth Association Council headquarters, the Chinese youth delegation was asked to sign a guestbook that had been signed by a "youth delegation" from Taiwan. The Chinese people and youth resolutely oppose the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas."
    We cannot but express our regret at this practice of the Japan Youth Association Council. This is not conducive to the development of friendly relations between the two organizations. Deputy Secretary-General Wen Chi stated that he believes that this matter is opposed by members of the Japan Youth Association Council and friends of the Japan Youth Association Council who advocate Sino-Japanese friendship.
    Head of Delegation Hayashi Teruo stated that the Japan Youth Association Council has passed a resolution that it only recognizes one China and does not recognize "two Chinas." It stipulates that strengthening friendship with the All-China Youth Federation is a principle, and it will never repeat the above-mentioned mistakes. He expressed regret over the matter of asking the Chinese youth delegation to sign a guestbook that had been signed by a "youth delegation" from Taiwan, and guaranteed that such things would not happen again in order to develop the friendly relations between our two organizations.
    Deputy Secretary-General Wen Chi stated that the All-China Youth Federation is pleased to accept the invitation of the Japan Youth Association Council and is willing to send a delegation to visit Japan in the first half of 1966.
    Both sides stated that they are willing to work together to eliminate all obstacles, to strive to develop the friendly relations between the peoples and youth of China and Japan, and to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

    我青联领导人和日本青协代表团长签署会谈记要
    努力发展中日人民和青年友好关系
    新华社六日讯　中华全国青年联合会副秘书长文迟和日本青年团协议会代表团团长林照雄，今天签署了一项会谈记要。
    下面是记要的全文：
    中华全国青年联合会副秘书长文迟和参加中日青年友好大联欢的日本青年团协议会代表团团长林照雄、副团长北条典彦、秘书长水野光四郎等就中华全国青年联合会和日本青年团协议会之间的友好关系问题进行了会谈，记要如下：
    日本青年团协议会代表团团长林照雄等表示，为增进中日友好，邀请中华全国青年联合会在一九六六年五月派一个十人代表团到日本作为期三周的访问。这是日青协代表团的愿望，也是日青协全体会员的愿望，希望这个愿望能够早日实现。同时，日青协将积极参加日本各青年团体联合邀请中华全国青年联合会代表团访问日本的筹备委员会，参加欢迎筹备工作；愿在这方面贡献出自己的力量。
    中华全国青年联合会副秘书长文迟表示，中国青年愿不断加强和发展中日两国人民和青年的团结友好关系，本着这个愿望，中华全国青年联合会愿意和日本的各个青年组织包括日本青年团协议会都加强友好往来，近几年来，在和日青协友好往来中，发生了一些问题。日青协在和中华全国青年联合会建立友好关系的同时，又派代表团去台湾。以后又发生中国青年代表团访日访问日青协本部时，要中国青年代表团在有台湾一个“青年代表团”签名过的留言簿上签名。中国人民和青年坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    我们对日青协这种作法不能不表示遗憾。这是不利于两组织之间友好关系的发展的。文迟副秘书长表示，相信这件事是日青协会员和日青协主张中日友好的朋友所反对的。
    林照雄团长表示，日青协已通过了决议，只承认一个中国，不承认“两个中国”，规定同中华全国青年联合会加强友好作为一个原则，以后决不再犯上述错误。对要中国青年代表团在有台湾“青年代表团”签过名的留言簿上签名一事，表示遗憾，保证以后不再发生这种事情，以便发展我们两个组织的友好关系。
    文迟副秘书长表示，中华全国青年联合会高兴地接受日青协的邀请，愿意在一九六六年上半年派代表团访问日本。
    双方表示，愿共同努力扫除一切障碍，为发展中日两国人民和青年的友好关系，为恢复中日邦交而努力。
