    Muddled Q&A
    According to the magazine "U.S. News & World Report," it conducted a survey among members of the U.S. Congress, asking them "whether North Vietnam should be bombed into submission." Of the thirty-five senators and two hundred thirty-seven representatives, sixteen senators and one hundred fifty-five representatives said "yes."
    This is hardly surprising. If they could "bomb" the Vietnamese people "into submission," they would certainly approve with both hands. The problem is that even the likes of Johnson and McNamara no longer believe that indiscriminate bombing can force the Vietnamese people to "submit." Otherwise, why would they engage in conspiracies such as "bombing pauses"? Therefore, the fact that these hundred-plus congressional gentlemen answered so straightforwardly only shows that they are so muddled that they lack even the most basic sense of reality.

    糊涂问答
    据《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志说，它在美国两院议员当中进行了一次调查，问他们“是否应当把北越轰炸到屈服”，三十五名参议员和二百三十七名众议员中，有十六名参议员和一百五十五名众议员说“应当”。
    这是毫不奇怪的。如果能够把越南人民“轰炸到屈服”，他们当然是双手赞成的。问题是，现在连约翰逊、麦克纳马拉之流也不认为狂轰滥炸能够迫使越南人民“屈服”了，不然他们为什么还要搞什么“暂停轰炸”一类的阴谋呢？因此，这一百多个议员老爷回答得那末干脆，只表明他们糊涂到连最起码的现实感也没有。
