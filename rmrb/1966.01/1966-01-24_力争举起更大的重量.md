    Looking at the world with broader vision fills us with more confidence, gazing at the distant future doubles our enthusiasm. We have just bid farewell to 1965 with boundless joy and now welcome the first Spring Festival of the Third Five-Year Plan with victorious confidence. On the occasion of this festive season, we wish all workers, people's commune members, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army a happy holiday and even greater and more glorious achievements in the new year.
    In the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have achieved brilliant victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The successful explosion of two atomic bombs, the birth of the 10,000-ton hydraulic press, and the prosperous scene in industry and agriculture... Like all other fronts in the country, the sports front has also achieved great success. Weightlifting, like other sports, has also made great strides. Our strongmen have broken twenty-five of the twenty-eight national weightlifting records, with four athletes breaking world records six times in three weight classes and three events. Furthermore, the total scores of four weight classes have entered the world's top three to six levels. The number of records broken and the magnitude of the improvement are unprecedented in any previous year.
    In the past year, I have vigorously grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works, constantly struggled against my own non-proletarian thoughts, and consciously made revolution. I also studied Comrade Xu Yinsheng's speech to the women's table tennis team and established lofty ambitions. Since then, I have gradually overcome individualistic gains and losses thinking, eliminated arrogance, and feared neither difficulties nor injuries in training, earnestly implementing the training principles of proceeding from difficulty, strictness, and the needs of actual combat in competitions. Like the People's Liberation Army, I trained with class feelings and a concept of the enemy, cultivating the spirit of "three fear-nots" and "five excellences." As a result, at the Second National Games, I broke the world record for the clean and jerk in the featherweight class, which was held by the American Berger, with a score of 153 kilograms, finally realizing my vow to snatch the record back from the Americans.
    Whether it is the people of Daqing and Dazhai, or the atomic bombs and hydraulic presses, whether it is the achievements of industry and agriculture, or the leap forward speed of sports, the common point is that of the thousands of lines, none can be separated from the first line of Mao Zedong Thought. Insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle will make us forever invincible. Mao Zedong Thought is our ideological weapon for rapidly climbing to the peak of world sports.
    In the new year, I want to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works well, work hard on the application of Mao Zedong Thought, train even more diligently, keep the motherland in my heart, keep the world in sight, and present outstanding achievements as a gift to the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    力争举起更大的重量
    放眼看世界信心更足，纵目望远景干劲倍增。我们刚以无限喜悦的心情送别了一九六五年，又满怀胜利的信心迎接第三个五年计划的第一个春节，在这佳节到来之际，祝愿全体工人、人民公社社员、解放军官兵节日愉快，在新的一年取得更加伟大、更加辉煌的成就。
    过去的一年，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了辉煌胜利。两颗原子弹的爆炸成功，万吨水压机的诞生，工农业呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象……体育战线同全国各个战线一样，取得了很大成绩。举重同其他项目一样，也取得了很大成绩。大力士们把全部二十八项举重全国纪录刷新了二十五项，其中四人在三个级别、三个项目，先后六次打破了世界纪录，并且有四个级别的总成绩进入了世界前三名至六名的水平，破纪录之多，提高幅度之大，为以往任何一年所不及。
    我在过去的一年中，由于狠抓了毛主席著作的学习，不断同自己的非无产阶级思想作斗争，自觉革命。又学习了徐寅生同志对乒乓球女队的讲话，树起了雄心壮志。从此，我逐渐克服了个人主义患得患失思想，铲除了骄娇二气，在训练中不怕难，不畏伤病，认真贯彻了从难、从严、从比赛实战需要出发的训练原则，象解放军那样，带着阶级感情和敌情观念去训练，培养“三不怕”，“五过硬”的作风。因而我在第二届全运会上，以一百五十三公斤的成绩打破了由美国人伯格所保持的次轻量级挺举的世界纪录，终于实现了从美国人手里夺回纪录的誓言。
    无论是大庆人和大寨人，还是原子弹和水压机，也无论是工农业的成就，还是体育事业的跃进速度，共同点是千条万条，离不开毛泽东思想第一条，坚持了毛泽东思想挂帅，就会永远立于不败之地。毛泽东思想就是我们迅速攀登世界体育高峰的思想武器。
    在新的一年里，我要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学好主席著作，在“用”字上下功夫，更加刻苦训练，胸怀祖国，眼观世界，以优异的成绩向第三个五年计划的头一年献礼。
