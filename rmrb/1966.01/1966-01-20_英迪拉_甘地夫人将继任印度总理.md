    (Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 19) According to the Press Trust of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, daughter of former Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Indian Minister of Information and Broadcasting, was elected leader of the ruling Congress Party parliamentary group on January 19. Because the Congress Party is the ruling party in India, the elected leader of the parliamentary group will succeed former Prime Minister Shastri as Prime Minister of India.
    Prior to the election, Congress Party President Kamaraj convened a meeting of the Congress Party Working Committee on January 14 to discuss candidates for leader of the Congress Party parliamentary group. It is reported that Mrs. Gandhi received the support of the chief ministers of most states, who issued a statement calling on former Finance Minister Desai to withdraw from the election. Congress Party President Kamaraj also told reporters that he would make efforts to get Desai to withdraw from the election in order to unanimously elect Mrs. Gandhi and "avoid unpleasant things in the election." However, these efforts to seek consensus did not succeed, and Desai still participated in the election.

    英迪拉·甘地夫人将继任印度总理
    据新华社十九日讯　新德里消息：据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度前总理尼赫鲁的女儿、印度宣传广播部长英迪拉·甘地夫人十九日当选为执政党国大党议会党团领袖。由于国大党是印度的执政党，当选的议会党团领袖将继前总理夏斯特里来担任印度总理职位。
    在选举以前，国大党主席卡马拉季在十四日主持召开了国大党工作委员会，讨论了国大党议会党团领袖的候选人。据报道，甘地夫人得到大多数邦的首席部长的支持，他们曾发表一项声明，呼吁前财政部长德赛退出竞选。国大党主席卡马拉季也对记者们说，他将作出努力使德赛退出竞选，以便一致选举甘地夫人和“避免竞选中的不愉快事情”。但是，这些寻求一致的努力并没有成功，德赛仍然参加了竞选。
