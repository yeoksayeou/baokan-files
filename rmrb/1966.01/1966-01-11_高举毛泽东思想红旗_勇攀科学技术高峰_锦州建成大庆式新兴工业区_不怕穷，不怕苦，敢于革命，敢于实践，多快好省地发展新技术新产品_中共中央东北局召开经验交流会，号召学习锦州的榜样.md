    Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Strive to Reach the Peak of Science and Technology
    Jinzhou Built into a Daqing-Style Emerging Industrial Zone
    Not Afraid of Poverty, Not Afraid of Hardship, Dare to Revolutionize, Dare to Practice, Develop New Technologies and New Products with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
    The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Holds Experience Exchange Meeting, Calls on People to Learn from Jinzhou's Example
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th – Recently, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an experience exchange meeting in Jinzhou City on developing new technologies and new products. The meeting concluded that Jinzhou City, always holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the general line, and following its own path, fully deserves the title of a Daqing-style emerging industrial region. Relevant leading departments have established the Jinzhou Industrial Zone as an example, calling on everyone to learn from them diligently, to hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher during the Third Five-Year Plan, emphasize politics, launch technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and make new contributions to catching up with the world's advanced levels and accelerating our country's socialist construction.
    The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the path of Jinzhou City in developing new technologies and new products is a path of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Their practices, such as starting with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, boldly experimenting, breaking conventions, mobilizing the masses, self-reliance, and closely integrating scientific research and production, all embody the Yan'an Spirit and the Daqing Spirit.
    In addition to introducing the Jinzhou experience, this meeting also saw the cities of Luda, Yingkou, Dandong, Mudanjiang, Jilin, and others introduce their experiences in developing new technologies and new products. The meeting held that Jinzhou and other cities have rich experience in developing new technologies and new products. The most fundamental experience is: taking Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, not being afraid of poverty, not being afraid of hardship, daring to revolutionize, and daring to practice.
    The meeting also believed that in the future work of developing new technologies and new products, the following experiences should be well promoted and applied: "Sculpt the spirit first, then build the temple" (i.e., first conduct small-scale technical experiments, and then build equipment and factories when the experiments are almost complete); carry out collaboration and the "three-way combination" inside and outside the factory, including the "relay race" of scientific research and production, long-distance connection, etc.; unified planning, division of labor and cooperation; concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, and so on.
    This meeting also discussed and arranged plans for the entire Northeast region and various cities to develop new technologies and new products in the future.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th – The originally very backward industry of Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, in the short period from 1958 to the present, has adhered to Mao Zedong Thought in command, promoted the revolutionary spirit of working hard and diligently, started with indigenous methods, and established a series of emerging industries, producing in batches many high-grade precision products that previously relied on imports, making significant contributions to our country's socialist construction.
    These emerging industries include vacuum smelting equipment, quartz glass, rare earth metals, semiconductors, instruments and meters, and chemical plastics, among others. The enterprises belonging to these emerging industries are all small factories, with a maximum of no more than five hundred people and a minimum of only a few dozen people. The equipment used is generally "indigenous equipment" that they have manufactured and innovated themselves. Now, they are producing one hundred and forty-one varieties and several hundred specifications of products, most of which are new products that our country could not produce a few years ago. The quality and production technology of many products have reached the domestic advanced level. A batch of new products are currently being trial-produced.
    Vacuum smelting is an advanced smelting technology in the world. The various high-purity metals and advanced alloys smelted by vacuum smelting equipment are indispensable raw materials for the development of the aviation industry, electronics industry, and chemical industry. In order to meet the urgent needs of national socialist construction, the Jinzhou Electric Furnace Factory was determined to arm itself and manufacture vacuum smelting equipment without any special equipment. Sure enough, in early 1961, they successfully trial-produced a vacuum induction furnace. The special steel smelted by this vacuum induction furnace is purer than that smelted by ordinary induction furnaces in the past. In recent years, a large amount of stainless steel used in the manufacture of fertilizer equipment in our country has been smelted from vacuum induction furnaces manufactured by our country. At the end of the same year, the electric furnace factory also made a vacuum consumable electrode arc furnace. This electric furnace can smelt high melting point metals such as molybdenum and titanium that vacuum induction furnaces cannot smelt, and the product purity is higher.
    In 1965, the electric furnace factory successfully trial-produced an electron bombardment furnace, which can only be produced by a few countries today. This electric furnace can smelt general refractory metals, and the purity of the products smelted is much higher than that of other electric furnaces.
    The ability to produce a complete set of various vacuum smelting equipment in batches indicates that our country's smelting technology has reached a new level.
    Quartz glass is resistant to high temperatures, high pressures, and corrosion, and it can also insulate, making it an indispensable high-grade material for the development of modern industry. Quartz glass is divided into transparent and opaque types. The Jinzhou Quartz Glass Factory does not have modern equipment for melting raw materials. However, they created a unique "indigenous furnace" and smelted both transparent and opaque quartz glass. At present, they are producing various quartz plates, quartz tubes, special-shaped tubes of different sizes, and more than one hundred kinds of quartz instruments. These products are being supplied to more than two hundred industrial production and scientific research units across the country. Several kinds of quartz glass products were once products that imperialism blocked and embargoed against our country and that modern revisionism used to hinder us. For example, some quartz glass products urgently needed by our country were not supplied to us by modern revisionism after they tore up the contract. Now, these products have been produced by the hard-working Jinzhou workers.
    In the past, transparent quartz glass was generally made from scarce and expensive crystal stone as raw material. However, the frugal and creative workers of the Jinzhou Quartz Glass Factory have found a new raw material for our country that is extremely abundant and very cheap. Putting the quartz tubes made from this new raw material together with the quartz tubes made from crystal stone, it is impossible to tell the difference. According to technical measurements, the transparency and performance of the two quartz tubes are almost exactly the same.
    Manufacturing semiconductor transistors is a new technology that has only appeared internationally in the last twenty years. Semiconductor transistors are also indispensable components for the development of modern industry and modern science and technology. A few years ago, our country was still lacking in this area.
    Jinzhou City is one of the earliest regions in our country to develop the semiconductor industry. The two semiconductor device factories in Jinzhou City, although they do not have modern constant temperature and humidity factory buildings or workshops, are now producing eleven varieties and forty-odd specifications of semiconductor transistors with large, medium, and small power.
    Now, Jinzhou City uses semiconductor transistors to produce and trial-produce various industrial and civilian products such as radios, hearing aids, and automatic control equipment.
    Most rare earth metals are just beginning to emerge internationally. Rare earth metals include seventeen kinds of metals, which have various special properties and play a significant role in the optical glass industry, metallurgical industry, and atomic energy industry. The workers of Jinzhou City also want to explore this emerging industry, which still has many unknowns. Now, they have smelted several alloys of rare earth aluminum, rare earth silicon, and rare earth magnesium, and made products such as rare earth optical glass and rare earth graphite steel. According to tests, graphite steel with rare earth metals added, when cast into rake teeth used in non-ferrous metal mines, weighs one-third less, and the service life can be increased by more than three times.
    In terms of instruments and meters, Jinzhou City has manufactured reading microscopes for measuring various high-precision machinery and high-precision instruments and meters, produced nautical instruments such as sound signals and navigation equipment, as well as high-temperature smelting instruments and meters. The Dalu Instrument Factory's "non-contact remote control and remote signaling device" manufactured for Daqing Oilfield is the latest achievement of our country's scientific research department. With this device installed, a worker sitting at the operating table can perform eight operations such as switching and temperature rise and fall of ten oil wells.
    In terms of chemical plastics, Jinzhou City has successfully trial-produced synthetic plasticizers and extracted nylon yarn using its own manufactured equipment and domestic raw materials.
    In addition, the workers of Jinzhou City have also relied on their own wisdom and hard-working hands, with the assistance of relevant parties, to successfully trial-produce many important products such as rubies for bearings for precision machinery.
    In the process of developing new technologies and new products, Jinzhou City has received strong assistance from scientific research departments, universities and colleges, and relevant units in various places. According to incomplete statistics, among the new products that have been produced in batches, sixty-three items are research results transplanted from scientific research departments in various places.
    In recent years, Jinzhou City has not only manufactured a large number of new products, but has also cultivated a group of technical talents who are good at working hard and diligently and dare to think and dare to act. Many people who originally knew nothing about the technology of emerging industries have learned a lot of scientific and technical knowledge in scientific experiments and production practices with their revolutionary spirit, and have become the technical backbone of their industries. Recently, more than one hundred ordinary workers have become technicians, and eighteen have become engineers.
    The person in charge of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC told our reporter that although Jinzhou City has made some achievements in the development of new technologies and new products, there are still many shortcomings. He expressed that the city's workers are determined to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sum up experience, overcome shortcomings, and make greater contributions to socialist construction.

    高举毛泽东思想红旗  勇攀科学技术高峰
    锦州建成大庆式新兴工业区
    不怕穷，不怕苦，敢于革命，敢于实践，多快好省地发展新技术新产品
    中共中央东北局召开经验交流会，号召学习锦州的榜样
    据新华社沈阳十日电  最近中共中央东北局在锦州市召开的发展新技术、新产品经验交流会，认为锦州市始终高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持总路线，走自己的道路，完全担当得起大庆式的新兴工业地区的称号。有关领导部门把锦州市工业区立为榜样，号召大家好好地向他们学习，在第三个五年计划期间，把毛泽东思想红旗举得更高，突出政治，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，为赶超世界先进水平，加快我国社会主义建设作出新的贡献。
    到会代表一致认为锦州市发展新技术新产品的道路，是一条多快好省的道路。他们的作法，如土法上马，土洋结合；大胆试验，打破框框；发动群众，自力更生；科学研究和生产紧密结合等，都体现了延安精神和大庆精神。
    这次会议，除介绍锦州经验外，旅大、营口、丹东、牡丹江、吉林等城市，也介绍了发展新技术、新产品方面的经验。会议认为，锦州和其他城市发展新技术新产品方面的经验很丰富。其中最根本的经验是：以毛泽东思想为指针，不怕穷，不怕苦，敢于革命，敢于实践。
    会议还认为，在今后发展新技术新产品的工作中，要很好地推广和运用下面的经验：“先塑神，后盖庙”（即先搞小规模技术试验，试验得差不多了，再去搞设备、建厂房）；开展协作和厂内外三结合，包括科学研究和生产的“接力赛”，远距离挂钩等；统一规划，分工协作；集中力量打歼灭战等等。
    这次会议还讨论和安排了东北全区和各城市今后发展新技术新产品的规划。
    据新华社沈阳十日电原来非常落后的辽宁省锦州市属工业，在一九五八年到现在的短期间内，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，发扬穷干苦干的革命精神，土法上马，建立起了一系列新兴工业，成批生产出许多过去依靠进口的高级精密产品，对我国社会主义建设作出了重大贡献。
    这些新兴工业包括真空冶炼设备、石英玻璃、稀土金属、半导体、仪器仪表和化工塑料等八个方面。这些新兴工业所属的企业，都是些小厂子，最多不超过五百人，最少只有几十人。所使用的设备，一般都是他们自己制造和革新的“土设备”。现在，他们生产着一百四十一个品种、几百种规格的产品，其中大部分是几年前我国还不能生产的新产品。不少产品的质量和生产工艺，已达到国内先进水平。目前还有一批新产品正在试制中。
    真空冶炼是世界上先进的冶炼技术。真空冶炼设备炼出来的各种高纯度金属和高级合金，是发展航空工业、电子工业、化学工业不可缺少的原材料。为了满足国家社会主义建设的迫切需要，锦州市的电炉厂决心在没有任何专用设备的情况下，自己武装自己，制造出真空冶炼设备。果然，在一九六一年初，他们就试制成功了真空感应电炉。这种真空感应电炉炼的特殊钢，比过去用普通感应电炉炼的要纯一些。最近几年我国制造化肥设备使用的大量不锈钢材，有许多就是从我国自己制造的真空感应电炉中冶炼出来的。在同一年底，这家电炉厂又作出了真空自耗电极电弧炉。这种电炉能够冶炼真空感应电炉不能冶炼的钼、钛等高熔点金属，而且产品纯度更高。
    一九六五年，这家电炉厂又试制成功了目前只有少数国家才能生产的电子轰击炉。这种电炉能够冶炼一般难熔金属，而且比其他电炉炼的产品，纯度要高得多。
    能够成套成批地生产多种真空冶炼设备，表明我国冶炼技术已经达到了一个新的水平。
    石英玻璃能耐高温、高压和耐腐蚀，还能绝缘，是发展现代工业不可缺少的高级材料。石英玻璃分透明与不透明两种。锦州石英玻璃厂没有熔炼原料的现代化设备，然而，他们独创一种“土熔炉”，把透明和不透明石英玻璃都炼制出来了。目前，他们生产着各种规格大小不同的石英板、石英管、异形管和一百多种石英仪器。这些产品正源源供应全国二百多个工业生产和科学研究单位使用。有几种石英玻璃制品曾是帝国主义对我国封锁禁运和现代修正主义卡我们的产品。如我国急需的一些石英玻璃制品，现代修正主义撕毁合同不供应我们。现在，这些产品都被奋发图强的锦州工人生产出来了。
    制造透明石英玻璃，过去一般是用既少又贵的水晶石作原料，然而，勤俭而富于创造性的锦州石英玻璃厂职工，却为我国找到了一种蕴藏极为丰富，价钱非常便宜的新原料。把这种新原料作的石英管同用水晶石作的石英管放在一起，辨别不出有什么差别。据技术测定，这两种石英管的透明度和性能几乎完全相等。
    制造半导体晶体管是最近二十年内才在国际上出现的一种新技术。半导体晶体管，也是发展现代工业、现代科学技术不可缺少的元件，前几年在我国还是缺门。
    锦州市是我国最早发展半导体工业的地区之一。锦州市的两家半导体器件厂，虽然没有现代化的恒温恒湿厂房或车间，现在却生产着大、中、小功率的十一个品种、四十几个规格的半导体晶体管。
    现在锦州市用半导体晶体管生产和试制了收音机、耳聋助听器和自动控制设备等多种工业和民用产品。
    大部分稀土金属在国际上还只是初露头角。稀土金属包括有十七种金属，它们具有多种特殊性能，在光学玻璃工业、冶金工业、原子能工业等方面有很大的作用。锦州市职工对这项还存在着许多未知数的新兴工业，也要去摸一摸、碰一碰。现在，他们已经炼出了稀土铝、稀土硅和稀土镁几种合金，作成了稀土光学玻璃、稀土石墨钢等产品。据测验证明，加稀土金属后的石墨钢，铸成有色金属矿山上使用的耙齿，重量减轻三分之一，使用寿命可以提高三倍以上。
    在仪器仪表方面，锦州市制成了用来测量各种高精度机械、高精度仪器仪表的读数显微镜，生产了音响信号和导航设备等航海仪器，以及高温冶炼仪器仪表等。大陆仪器厂为大庆油田制造的“无触点远控远信装置”，是我国科学研究部门的最新成果。安上这个装置，一个工人坐在操作台上，就可以进行十口油井的开关和温度升降等八项作业。
    在化工塑料方面，锦州市试制成功了合成增塑剂，用自己制造的设备和国产原料抽出了锦纶丝。
    此外，锦州市职工还依靠自己的智慧和勤劳的双手，在有关方面协助下，试制成功了供精密机械作轴承用的红宝石等不少重要产品。
    锦州市在发展新技术新产品过程中，曾得到各地科学研究部门、大专院校和有关单位的大力协助。据不完全统计，已经成批生产的新产品中，有六十三项是从各地科学研究部门移植过来的研究成果。
    几年来，锦州市不仅制造了大量的新产品，还培养出了一批善于穷干苦干又敢想敢干的技术人材。很多原来对新兴工业技术一窍不通的人，凭着他们的革命精神，在科学实验和生产实践中，学到了许多科学技术知识，成了本行业的技术骨干。最近，有一百多名普通职工作了技术员，有十八名作了工程师。
    中共锦州市委负责人向本社记者说，锦州市在发展新技术新产品方面，虽然取得了一些成就，但是也还存在不少缺点。他表示，全市职工决心继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，总结经验，克服缺点，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
