    This newspaper reports: A wave of studying Chairman Mao's works has been launched among commercial workers in our country. At a recent political work conference held by the Ministry of Commerce system, eighty activists in studying Chairman Mao's works from all over the country reported that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is causing revolutionary changes in the spiritual outlook of commercial workers and the work of commercial departments. As long as Mao Zedong Thought takes command, commercial work can continue to advance and become better and better.

          Studying for the Sake of Revolution

    These activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, selected from various regions at different levels, are representatives of outstanding figures among the vast number of commercial workers who are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. There are representatives from all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the country, and from all twelve industries in the Ministry of Commerce system. Among them are leading cadres from companies and grassroots units, shop assistants, service personnel, workers, and office staff. Among them are Han Chinese workers, as well as workers from minority ethnic groups such as Mongolians, Koreans, Hui, Yi, and Dong. Some have a university education, while others are illiterate. The oldest is fifty-seven years old, and the youngest is only nineteen years old. This situation shows that the study of Chairman Mao's works in the Ministry of Commerce system has formed a widespread mass movement.

      “To make revolution, one must study Chairman Mao's works.” “To make revolution, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to arm oneself.” With this understanding, these advanced figures study the works of the great leader with a thirst for knowledge. With deep class feelings and unyielding perseverance, they study to transform themselves, to do their work well, in a word, to study for the sake of revolution. Wang Erhuo, a worker at the Yuci Petroleum Station in Shanxi, lost sight in one eye and also had problems with the other due to the devastation of the old society; he had never been to school before and now only recognizes a hundred or so characters. However, he is determined to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words, so he insists on listening to lectures on the radio and asking others to read Chairman Mao's works to him. Now, he has studied more than thirty articles by Chairman Mao and memorized more than three hundred quotations. He uses the Mao Zedong Thought he has learned in class struggle, in his daily work, to improve his awareness, and to help backward comrades. He also led the workers in his group to study Chairman Mao's works, transform their thinking, and improve their work, finally turning this group from backward to advanced. From this, he concludes that studying Chairman Mao's works means that early study leads to early progress, late study leads to late progress, whoever studies progresses, and those who don't study don't progress.

          Raising Revolutionary Consciousness

    Among the activists in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Ministry of Commerce system, some originally had the idea of ​​underestimating commercial work, had more individualistic plans, and were not at ease in their work. Some people, although buried in their work, do not understand the revolutionary significance of their work. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they linked their daily business activities with the long-term goals of the revolution, and their revolutionary world outlook was established. They said, "Chairman Mao's works make me stand tall and see far." "Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun, it illuminates my heart and makes me understand why people live."

    Yu Hua, a young shop assistant at the Nanjing Update Department Store in Jiangsu Province, thought that working behind the counter was "unpromising" when she first came to the commercial sector as a shop assistant in 1959. She worked listlessly and with little enthusiasm. The first time she studied "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," she felt ashamed when compared with the revolutionary spirit of Bethune and Zhang Side. Later, after studying "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Working Methods," she learned that if we care about the well-being of the masses, the masses will definitely support us and regard the revolution as their life. From this, she realized that doing business is closely related to the revolution and that commercial work is a noble revolutionary work. After further studying "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," she began to establish the idea of ​​serving the people and understood what it means to live a meaningful life. From then on, she actively studied business techniques, enthusiastically and proactively served customers, and paid attention to collecting customers' opinions on commodities, reflecting them to factories, and assisting factories in improving production. She finally became a relatively outstanding shop assistant.

    Many commercial personnel have studied Mao Zedong's theory on class and class struggle, improved their class consciousness, and in the class struggle within and outside the enterprise, they have taken a firm stand and actively struggled against bourgeois evil winds and various undesirable tendencies.

          Correcting the Direction of Management

    The vast number of commercial workers, after studying Chairman Mao's works, understood that all business activities in commercial work must have a firm and clear political direction. The capitalist management ideas and management styles that remain in enterprises have been further overcome, and political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints have been generally strengthened. The direction of enterprise management is more correct than in the past.

    Li Suwen, deputy political instructor of the Heping Non-staple Food Store in Shenyang, under the leadership of the Party branch, organized and led all the employees of the store to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The employees understood that shop assistants are not only economic workers, but also political workers and mass workers, and should well implement the "three major viewpoints" in business activities. Some employees took the initiative to examine their own erroneous management styles. For example, when some shop assistants helped customers pick apples, they deliberately pinched the wormholes to fool customers. Some shop assistants consciously put a bad one on when picking watermelons for a customer who looked like they had a lot of income. After study and discussion, the socialist management style of the store was greatly promoted. Once, a customer came to buy a chicken for a woman in confinement. After the shop assistant opened it up, he found that the intestines were stuck together. The shop assistant wanted to quickly push the intestines to the side so that the customer would not see them, and sell it like this. However, he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teaching about being extremely responsible for work, and felt a burning sensation on his face. He thought: Selling this sick chicken is only two yuan, but if the woman in confinement eats it and it causes adverse consequences, then it cannot be bought back with any amount of money. He explained the situation to the customer and slaughtered another live chicken for him. The customer repeatedly praised: "It is indeed a socialist business!"

          Exploring the Laws of Work

    After studying Chairman Mao's works, many commercial workers began to apply materialist dialectics to the counter and to various business activities, analyzing contradictions, exploring laws, further improving their work, and improving the quality of service.

    Sometimes contradictions occur between shop assistants and customers. In the past, shop assistants often thought, "It takes two hands to clap," and when disputes occurred, both parties were responsible. Some people also liked to attribute responsibility to the customer. After studying "On Contradiction," many shop assistants understood the principle of analyzing the main aspects of the contradiction when looking at contradictions. They went to explore where the main aspect of this contradiction usually lies. After analysis, many people realized that the shop assistant sells goods, and whether the customer can buy goods smoothly often depends on the shop assistant's service attitude and service quality.

    Generally speaking, the main aspect of the contradiction lies with the shop assistant. With this clarified, shop assistants will check the reasons from their own side more often and pay attention to improving, which can avoid and reduce contradictions with customers. Wei Shuqin, deputy political instructor of the No. 7 Department Store of the Harbin Department Store Company in Heilongjiang Province, also specifically analyzed that in five situations, the shop assistant's service attitude is often different from usual, and therefore it is easy to have contradictions with customers. These are: near the end of the shift, it is different from usual, near the end of work, it is different from usual, when you have unpleasant things, it is different from usual, when the customer brings back the goods to exchange them, it is different from usual, and when the customer picks and chooses many times, it is different from usual. In these situations, contradictions often arise because the shop assistant is impatient and the service attitude is rigid, and the main aspect of the contradiction is generally on the shop assistant's side. Later, they paid attention to making the service attitude the same as usual in these five situations, and the phenomenon of shop assistants arguing with customers was greatly reduced.

    The political work conference of the Ministry of Commerce system summarized and exchanged the experiences of these study activists, and called on them to lead the vast number of employees to study better. It can be expected that the activities of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way in the Ministry of Commerce system will be carried out more universally, more deeply, more solidly, and more effectively.

### 商业战线职工大学毛主席著作的经验证明：  照毛主席的指示办事就是灵

    商业战线职工大学毛主席著作的经验证明：
    照毛主席的指示办事就是灵
    本报讯　我国商业职工掀起了一个学习毛主席著作的热潮。在商业部系统最近举行的政治工作会议上，来自全国各地的八十名学习毛主席著作的积极分子汇报说：毛泽东思想的光辉，使商业职工的精神面貌和商业部门的工作正在发生革命性的变化。只要毛泽东思想挂帅，商业工作就能不断前进，越做越好。
          为革命而学习
    这些学习毛主席著作的积极分子，经过各地层层选拔，他们是广大商业职工活学活用毛主席著作的优秀人物的代表。全国各个省、市、自治区，都有代表；商业部系统的十二个行业，行行都有代表。他们当中，有公司、基层单位的领导干部，有营业员、服务员、工人，也有科室人员。他们当中，有汉族职工，也有蒙古、朝鲜、回族、彝族、侗族等少数民族职工。他们当中，有的是大学文化程度，有的还是文盲。最老的五十七岁，最小的只有十九岁。这种情况说明，商业部系统学习毛主席著作，已经形成广泛的群众性运动。
      “要革命，就要学习毛主席著作。”“要革命，就要靠毛泽东思想武装。”这些先进人物，就是本着这样的认识，如饥似渴地来学习伟大领袖的著作的。他们怀着深厚的阶级感情，以坚韧不拔的毅力，为改造自己而学，为做好工作而学，一句话，为革命而学。山西榆次石油站工人王二货，由于旧社会的摧残，一只眼睛失明，另一只眼睛也有毛病；过去没有读过书，现在也只认得百把十个字。可是，他一心要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，就坚持从收音机里听讲座，请别人给他念主席著作。现在，他已经学习了毛主席的三十多篇文章，记住了三百多条语录。他把学到的毛主席思想，用在阶级斗争中，用在日常工作中，用来提高自己的觉悟，用来帮助后进的同志。他还带动全组工人学习毛主席著作，改造思想，改进工作，终于使这个小组由落后变为先进。他由此得出结论：学习毛主席著作是，早学早进步，晚学晚进步，谁学谁进步，不学不进步。
          提高革命觉悟
    商业部系统的学习毛主席著作积极分子当中，有一部分人原来有轻视商业工作的思想，个人主义打算比较多，工作不够安心。有的人虽然埋头干活，却不懂得自己工作的革命意义。经过学习毛主席著作，把自己的日常业务活动跟革命的远大目标联系起来了，革命的世界观树立起来了。他们说：“毛主席著作使我站得高，看得远。”“毛泽东思想象太阳，它照亮了我的心，使我懂得了人活着是为什么。”
    江苏省南京市更新百货商店青年营业员余华，在一九五九年刚到商业部门当营业员的时候，认为站柜台“没出息”。工作起来有气无力，劲头不大。第一次学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，同白求恩、张思德的革命精神对比起来，感到很惭愧。后来学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，了解到我们关心群众生活，群众就必定拥护我们，把革命当作他们的生命。从这里，她认识到做买卖跟革命有密切联系，认识到商业工作是一项崇高的革命工作。她经过进一步学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，开始树立起为人民服务的思想，懂得了人活着怎样才有意义。从此，她就积极钻研业务技术，热情、主动地为顾客服务，并且注意收集顾客对商品的意见，向工厂反映，协助工厂改进生产。她终于成为一个比较优秀的营业员。
    许多商业人员学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，提高了阶级觉悟，在企业内和企业外的阶级斗争中，立场坚定，积极向资产阶级歪风邪气和各种不良倾向作斗争。
          端正经营方向
    广大商业职工学习了毛主席著作，懂得了商业工作的一切业务活动，必须有坚定明确的政治方向。企业中残存的资本主义经营思想、经营作风进一步得到克服，政治观点、生产观点和群众观点普遍加强。企业的经营方向比过去端正了。
    沈阳市和平副食品商店副政治指导员李素文，在党支部领导下，组织和带动全店职工反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等毛主席的著作，职工们懂得了营业员不仅是经济工作者，也是政治工作者和群众工作者，在业务活动中应当很好地贯彻“三大观点”。有的职工主动检查了自己错误的经营作风。例如，有的营业员帮顾客挑苹果的时候，故意把虫眼捏上，糊弄顾客。有的营业员给一个看上去收入多的顾客挑西瓜，竟有意识地放上个坏的。经过学习、讨论，商店社会主义经营作风大大发扬。有一次，有个顾客来给产妇买鸡，营业员帮他开膛以后，发现肠子粘连在一块了。营业员想把肠子赶紧推到一边，不让顾客看见，就这样卖出去。可是，他立刻想到毛主席关于对工作要极端地负责任的教导，感到脸上火辣辣的。他想：卖出这只病鸡，不过两块钱，如果产妇吃了，引起不良后果，那就是多少钱也买不回来的。他便向顾客说明情况，另给宰了一只活鸡。顾客连连称赞：“到底是社会主义商业！”
          探索工作规律
    许多商业职工学习毛主席著作以后，开始把唯物辩证法应用到柜台上，应用到各项业务工作中，通过分析矛盾，探索规律，进一步改进工作，提高服务质量。
    营业员同顾客之间有时候会发生矛盾。过去，营业员往往认为，“一个巴掌拍不响”，发生争执，双方都有责任。有的人还喜欢把责任归之于顾客。学习《矛盾论》以后，不少营业员懂得了看待矛盾要分析主要的矛盾方面的道理。他们就去探索在通常情况下，这种矛盾的主要矛盾方面究竟在哪里？经过分析，不少人认识到，营业员是卖货的，顾客来买货，能不能买得顺心，往往决定于营业员的服务态度和服务质量。
    一般地说，主要的矛盾方面在营业员。明确了这一点，营业员就会多从自己方面检查原因，注意改进，这就能避免和减少同顾客的矛盾。黑龙江省哈尔滨市百货公司第七商店副政治指导员魏淑琴，还具体分析出在五种情况下，营业员的服务态度往往和平时不一样，因而就容易同顾客发生矛盾。这就是：快要交班时与平时不一样，快要下班时与平时不一样，自己有不愉快的事的时候与平时不一样，顾客买去商品又拿回来换的时候与平时不一样，顾客挑选次数较多的时候与平时不一样。在这些情况下产生矛盾，往往是营业员不耐心、服务态度生硬所引起的，主要的矛盾方面一般都在营业员一边。以后，他们注意在这五种情况下，做到服务态度和平时一样，营业员跟顾客吵嘴的现象就大大减少了。
    商业部系统政治工作会议，总结交流了这些学习积极分子的经验，号召他们带动广大职工更好地学习。可以预期，商业部系统活学活用毛主席著作的活动，将会开展得更普遍，更深入，更扎实，并且更有成效。
