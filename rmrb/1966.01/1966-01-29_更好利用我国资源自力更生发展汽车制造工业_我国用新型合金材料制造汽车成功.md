    To Better Utilize China's Resources and Rely on Our Own Efforts to Develop the Automobile Manufacturing Industry
    China Successfully Manufactures Automobiles Using New Alloy Materials
    The first batch of automobiles has undergone three years of performance testing, proving excellent results; providing a way to save chromium for the production of other mechanical industrial products.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 28th. Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, in cooperation with Benxi and other steel plants, has successfully experimented with the production of Jiefang brand trucks using new alloy steel and alloy cast iron. This technological achievement is of great significance for better utilizing China's resource conditions and developing China's automobile manufacturing industry through self-reliance.
    Many key parts of automobiles, such as axles, gears, and cylinder blocks, require good performance. Some require hardness without brittleness, some require toughness without softness, and some require external hardness with internal toughness. In the past, the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant followed the usual foreign practice of using chromium steel and chromium cast iron to produce these parts. This consumed more than five kilograms of pure chromium per vehicle. Chromium is a relatively valuable metal. How to explore the use of other elements to replace it based on China's resource conditions is an important issue related to China's self-reliant development of the automobile industry.
    The practice of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant shows that new alloy materials manufactured using China's abundant alloy elements can completely replace chromium steel and chromium cast iron in the manufacture of key parts of automobiles.
    The first batch of several hundred Jiefang brand automobiles manufactured using new alloy steel and alloy cast iron has undergone three years of performance testing, proving excellent results. These performance tests were conducted under various usage conditions. Some were driven on the steep slopes and sharp turns of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau; some sped across the vast Gobi Desert; and some operated in the rainy and muddy southern forest areas. Currently, these automobiles have generally traveled 70,000 to 80,000 kilometers, with some reaching 150,000 to 160,000 kilometers. Disassembly inspections and on-site surveys of these automobiles show that most of the gear and axle parts are normal, and the wear resistance of the cylinder blocks is also very good.
    Automobiles are representative mechanical industrial products. The successful experiment of Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in using new alloy materials to replace chromium steel and chromium cast iron in the manufacture of automobiles also provides a way to save chromium for the production of other mechanical industrial products.
    The experimental research work of Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and Benxi and other steel plants in exploring the use of other elements to replace chromium as automobile alloys began in 1958. Over the past eight years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers have carried out a large number of complex experimental research work. Based on China's abundant alloy element resources, they first produced nine kinds of alloy steel and alloy cast iron, and conducted various mechanical performance tests in the laboratory to compare their advantages and disadvantages with chromium steel and chromium cast iron. Then, they selected several promising alloy steels and alloy cast irons and processed them into parts in the workshop to test their processing performance. The results show that compared with the steel used before, the performance of the new materials is sometimes similar and sometimes even better.
    The experimental research work on manufacturing automobiles using new alloy materials has received the concern and support of the leading departments such as the State Science and Technology Commission, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the First Ministry of Machine Building, and has also received strong support and cooperation from relevant scientific research institutions.
    Recently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building jointly held a special meeting in Beijing to appraise the automobile parts manufactured with new alloys, summarize the work of the previous stage, and exchange experiences. The meeting decided that starting this year, this new type of alloy should be used step-by-step in automobile production, and a work plan for continuing experimental research was formulated to strive for greater and better results.

    更好利用我国资源自力更生发展汽车制造工业
    我国用新型合金材料制造汽车成功
    第一批汽车经过三年使用性能试验，证明效果良好；为生产其它机械工业产品提供了节约用铬的途径
    新华社长春二十八日电  长春第一汽车制造厂和本溪等钢厂合作采用新型合金钢和合金铸铁生产解放牌载重汽车，已经试验成功。这一技术成就，对于更好地利用我国资源条件自力更生地发展我国汽车制造工业，具有重大意义。
    汽车上的轴、齿轮和汽缸体等许多关键零件，要求具有良好的性能，有的要求硬而不脆，有的要求韧而不软，还有的要求外硬而内韧。长春第一汽车制造厂以往都是按照国外的通常做法，采用铬钢和铬铸铁生产这些零件的。这样做，每辆汽车要耗用纯铬五公斤多。铬是比较贵重的金属，如何根据我国资源条件，探索用其它元素加以代替，这是关系我国自力更生发展汽车工业的重要问题。
    长春第一汽车制造厂的实践表明，采用我国丰富的合金元素制造的新型合金材料完全能够代替铬钢和铬铸铁制造汽车上的关键零件。
    第一批采用新型合金钢和合金铸铁制造的几百辆解放牌汽车，经过长达三年的使用性能试验，证明效果良好。这些性能试验是在各种各样的使用条件下进行的。其中有的行驶在坡大弯急的云贵高原；有的奔驰在广漠无垠的戈壁滩上，有的运行在多雨泥泞的南方林区。目前这些汽车一般都行驶了七八万公里，多的达到十五六万公里。这些汽车经过拆卸检查和现场调查表明，齿轮和轴类零件绝大部分都正常，汽缸体耐磨性能也很好。
    汽车是一种具有代表性的机械工业产品。长春第一汽车制造厂采用新型合金材料代替铬钢和铬铸铁制造汽车的试验成功，也为生产其它一些机械工业产品提供了一条节约用铬的途径。
    长春第一汽车制造厂和本溪等钢厂职工探索用其它元素代铬作为汽车合金的试验研究工作，是从一九五八年开始的。在这八年多的时间里，职工们在毛泽东思想的指导下，进行了大量的复杂的试验研究工作。他们根据我国丰富的合金元素资源情况，首先制成了九种合金钢和合金铸铁，在试验室里进行各种机械性能试验，同铬钢和铬铸铁比较优劣，然后选择其中有希望的几种合金钢和合金铸铁，在车间里加工成零件，从中考验它的工艺性能。结果表明，同原来使用的钢材相比，新材料的性能有的相近，有的更优越。
    采用新型合金材料制造汽车的试验研究工作，得到了国家科学技术委员会、国家经济委员会、冶金工业部、第一机械工业部等领导部门的关怀和支持，并且得到了各有关科学研究机关的大力支持和配合。
    最近，冶金工业部和第一机械工业部在北京联合召开了专门会议，鉴定了用新型合金制造的汽车零件，总结了前一阶段的工作，交流了经验。会议决定从今年开始，在汽车生产上有步骤地使用这种新型合金，并且制定了继续进行试验研究的工作规划，力求取得更大更好的成果。
