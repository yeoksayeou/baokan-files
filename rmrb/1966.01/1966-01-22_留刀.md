    Leaving the Cutter
    Beijing Railway Bureau  Shi Yuxiang
    When female lathe operator Shen Eryun came to her shift, she saw that her lathe was polished and bright, and the floor was clean. Only a new style cutter was placed on the locked toolbox, which made her quite puzzled.
    It turned out that a few days ago, a new task was assigned to the lathe used by Xiao Shen and others. This task was slow and prone to producing defective products, making it difficult to do well. Not to mention third-grade worker Xiao Shen, even Li Hongxiang, a senior worker who used the same lathe as her, couldn't come up with a good solution for a while. But because Li Hongxiang kept pondering, he finally made a "combination cutter" that day. By the time it was tested and proven successful, it was already time to get off work. After wiping the lathe and sweeping away the iron filings, he was just about to put the cutter into the toolbox when a thought suddenly struck him: Now the increase production and practice economy movement is in full swing, and everyone is eager to finish the work as soon as possible. If Xiao Shen continues to use the old method, it will waste time. Why don't I leave this sharpened new cutter for her? So he put this "combination cutter" in the most conspicuous place - on the toolbox.
    Xiao Shen, using this cutter, worked very smoothly. Looking at the rapidly rotating lathe and the iron filings flying everywhere, she increased production and improved quality, and felt extremely happy.

    留刀
    北京铁路管理局  石玉祥
    女车工申二云接班来，看到自己的车床擦得明光铮亮，地面干干净净。唯独锁紧的工具箱上放着一把新样式的车刀，她挺纳闷。
    原来几天前，分配给小申他们这台车床一种新活。这种活，既慢又易出废品，不好干。不用说三级工小申，就是跟她使用同一台车床的高级工李洪祥，一时都想不出好道道来。但由于李洪祥不断琢磨，这天终于做出了一把“组合刀”。等试成了，竟到下班的时间了。擦完车床，扫完铁屑，他刚想把车刀放进工具箱，心里立刻一动，他想：现在增产节约运动搞的这么红火，活到手恨不得立刻干完。小申再用老办法干，又要耽误时间，我何不把这把磨好的新式刀留给她？于是他就把这把“组合刀”放在最显眼的地方——工具箱上了。
    小申，用这把车刀干起活来特别顺当，她看着快速旋转着的车床，四处飞射着的铁屑，提高了产量、质量，心里别提多痛快。
