    Materialist Dialectics is Infinitely Powerful
    Zhou Mingshan, Party Branch Secretary of Nanliu Brigade, Jiang County, Shanxi
    Editor's note: On page 1 of this newspaper on December 24, 1965, we introduced the experience of the Nanliu Brigade Party Branch in taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all its work. In this article, we can further see how the Nanliu Brigade Party Branch applies the basic viewpoints of materialist dialectics advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong to solve various problems in production and work, gradually change the backward face of the countryside, and rapidly increase production. In their work, they are also good at consulting with the masses, promptly addressing the active thoughts of the commune members, unifying understanding through democratic discussion, making the party's policies accepted by the masses, and thus transforming spirit into matter. Their experience is worth learning from by everyone.
      1965 was a year of extraordinary natural disasters for the Nanliu Brigade, but also a year of comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations.
      We suffered a severe drought in 1960, but the drought in 1965 was even more serious. In 1960, the dry soil layer reached one foot three inches, and in 1965, it reached one foot five inches. The drought in 1960 lasted until July 15, while in 1965, from April 20 to September 4, there was no thorough rain, a drought of one hundred and thirty-seven days from summer to autumn. However, the people of Nanliu, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, finally overcame numerous difficulties and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest and great development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations in a year of great disaster. The per-mu yield of grain was 426 jin, an increase of 19.6% over 1964, and the first ideal of grain per-mu yield exceeding the Yellow River was realized. The cotton field area increased by 11.5% compared to 1964, with a per-mu yield of 93.5 jin, an increase of 1.5 jin compared to the per-mu yield in 1964, and a total output increase of 13.3%. At the same time, livestock and pigs both increased by 20% compared to 1964, sideline income increased by 40%, and forestry also experienced a leap forward in development. The total income for the entire year of 1965 increased by 13% compared to 1964.
    Why were we able to achieve such good harvests? Recently, we organized the masses for multiple discussions. After discussing and discussing, everyone unanimously believed that it should be attributed to Mao Zedong Thought. The power of Chairman Mao's dialectical thought is immeasurable. Chen Xiweng said it well: "Chairman Mao's thought is higher than Mount Tai, deeper than the sea, and brighter than the sun, and is an infinitely powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions can overcome even great droughts."
          Production Reaching Its Peak and Continuous Revolution
    In 1964, Nanliu's agricultural production had already achieved great results. However, the Party branch clearly recognized that this was only like completing the first step of a long march. Therefore, based on a comprehensive summary of the year's production, the masses were further mobilized to formulate the 1965 production plan. When we proposed the 1965 production plan, it caused fierce debate. Some people believed that although we have made great achievements in agricultural production, the potential of the land is still very large, and the subjective initiative of the people has not been fully mobilized. Our production achievements are still far behind many advanced units, and many units that originally could not make the list have caught up with or surpassed us. Therefore, we must further boost our energy and strive for the upstream in order to continuously advance and continuously improve. However, some people held different views. They said: "People often say that contentment brings happiness! Based on Nanliu's deep gullies and steep slopes, a wheat yield of 200-300 jin per mu and a cotton yield of over 90 jin per mu is already very good. It would be good enough to just maintain it next year." In order to unify thinking and understanding, we guided everyone to further study Chairman Mao's viewpoint of "one divides into two" and launched a "compare (conditions), look (yield)" activity, comparing internally with Team One and externally with the Yangtan Brigade. Team One was originally a backward team in Nanliu, with slope land accounting for more than 90%, but the wheat yield per mu in 1964 was 314 jin, 10.7% higher than the average of 283.5 jin per mu for the entire brigade; the cotton yield per mu was 103 jin, 11.9% higher than the average cotton yield of 92 jin per mu for the entire brigade. After this comparison, many people had nothing to say. Then we compared with the Yangtan Brigade. A few years ago, we proposed the slogan "Learn from Yangtan, catch up with Yangtan," but we have never caught up. When Yangtan was mentioned, many people started talking. Gao Guangjun said: "The conditions in Nanliu and Yangtan are similar. Yangtan's land faces the sun, and Nanliu's land faces the shade, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Why is Yangtan's cotton yield higher than Nanliu's?" Wang Tianxing continued: "It's not that Nanliu's conditions are poor, but that our enthusiasm is small. As long as we boost our enthusiasm, grain and cotton yields will definitely catch up with Yangtan." As a result of the comparison, it was unanimously agreed that Nanliu was inferior to Yangtan in five aspects, namely, management and administration, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, diversified operations, collective reserves, and cotton yield. Finally, the slogan "Boost our energy and work hard for a year, and catch up with Yangtan in grain and cotton yield" was proposed, and the 1965 production plan was formulated.
          Resisting Waterlogging and Preventing Drought and Resisting Drought and Preventing Waterlogging
    Engaging in agricultural production is dealing with the weather. Drought and waterlogging are the weather's two best plays, often performed in rotation. In the struggle against natural disasters, the main thing is to fight against drought and waterlogging. When focusing on resisting waterlogging, we must not forget to prevent drought. When focusing on resisting drought, we must not forget to prevent waterlogging. This way, we can always maintain the initiative and always remain invincible.
    1964 was a year of excessive rain and disasters. Nearly 1,000 millimeters of rain fell throughout the year, nearly double the normal annual rainfall. The first hurdle related to the increase in grain and cotton production in 1965 was how to deal with the two types of disasters, waterlogging and drought, in cotton autumn field preparation and wheat winter management. During the autumn plowing, we started from the perspective of resisting waterlogging and preventing drought, and proposed the requirements of autumn plowing with harrowing, deep plowing and harrowing well. However, some people disagreed, saying:
  "With so much rain, there is sufficient moisture and soil saturation. Autumn plowing without harrowing can break down the soil and kill pests. It is better to have autumn plowing without harrowing." In order to correctly combine resisting waterlogging and preventing drought, and achieve dual insurance against drought and waterlogging, we guided everyone to recall the disaster relief struggles of the past few years and explore the规律of natural disasters. For many years, drought and waterlogging disasters have appeared alternately, often with waterlogging after drought and drought after waterlogging. There is a saying in the local area: "Great waterlogging is always followed by great drought, and great drought is always followed by great waterlogging." However, the Nanliu area, like other parts of Shanxi, suffers more from drought than waterlogging. Therefore, when resisting waterlogging, we must pay attention to preventing drought. In this way, everyone unanimously realized that the measure of autumn plowing with harrowing was correct. All 1,020 mu of cotton autumn fields in the brigade were universally plowed and harrowed, and the saline-alkali land was harrowed two to three times. This ensured the timely sowing and full emergence of crops.
    In wheat winter management, the same problem occurred again. Originally, winter topdressing and harrowing of wheat was a good experience that had been proven in practice in the Nanliu Brigade. However, due to the abundant rainfall and sufficient base moisture that year, some people developed a paralyzing mentality, believing that wheat could still guarantee increased production even without winter harrowing. Some people were also worried that due to the good base moisture, the fertilizer effect of winter topdressing would be rapid, which might not be as good as topdressing once in the spring. In response, we organized cadres and the masses for discussion again. After discussion, we unified our thinking and understanding, and the progress of topdressing was very fast. All 1,230 mu of wheat fields in the brigade were universally topdressed and harrowed. According to experiments in the small farm, winter topdressing increased production by more than 30% compared to spring topdressing.
    In the continuous major drought of 1965, we resolutely carried out the drought resistance struggle, but still paid attention to flood prevention. For example, cotton adopted early topdressing, early pest control, and early pruning in order to promote early boll formation and early opening of cotton. This not only helped prevent waterlogging, but also helped resist drought. Cotton that was topdressed and managed early produced an average of one and a half more bolls per plant, and the bolls were large, the lint was long, and the opening was early. In the wheat field, we renovated one hundred field embankments to better conserve soil and water. In land preparation, we adopted measures of leveling land in stages, digging soil no more than one foot, padding soil no more than two inches, and plowing the ditches while digging soil, and harrowing the land while padding soil. This not only helped prevent waterlogging, but also ensured that wheat could be sown on time and emerge fully even in the event of a severe drought with no rain.
          Agricultural Production and Diversified Operations
    Agricultural production and diversified operations are like two wheels of a car and two wings of a bird. With these two wheels and two wings, the collective economy can run faster and fly higher.
    In the past few years, because we only emphasized agriculture and neglected diversified operations, agricultural production developed quickly, while diversified operations developed slowly, resulting in an abnormal situation of "high grain and cotton yields, but low dividends for commune members." In recent years, after learning from the advanced experiences of various places, especially learning from the experience of the Jiajiazhuang Brigade in Fenyang County in promoting sideline occupations with agriculture, raising livestock with sideline occupations, promoting agriculture with livestock, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, the thinking of most people has become clear, and they urgently demand comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. However, when we proposed the plan for comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations in the winter of 1964, some people said: "If we only focus on agriculture, we can't catch up with Dazhai and Yangtan. If we also focus on diversified operations, we will be resting in the shade under a tiger's head (meaning one high and one low)." Some were also afraid that diversified operations would not be successful, and they would not profit but lose money. They said: "Grasp one thing and you get one thing, grasp two things and you lose two things. Two things are not as good as one." Guo Yushan, who had been engaged in sideline occupations for many years, said: "There are同行, but no 同利. We have been engaged in sideline production for years, but we have not benefited. I think we should disband the sideline occupations and focus on agriculture."
    In response to the above ideas, we asked everyone to discuss two topics: one is whether agricultural production and diversified operations are mutually exclusive or mutually promoting? The other is why can Jiajiazhuang do well in diversified operations, but we cannot? At the same time, we guided everyone to summarize the experiences and lessons of diversified operations in recent years. With the continuous deepening of discussions, people's thinking gradually became unified. Li Yongtang said: "A person cannot walk on one leg, and a bird cannot fly with one wing. Chairman Mao has always advocated walking on two legs. In recent years, our collective economy has not developed fast enough because it only has the one leg of agricultural production. If we add the leg of diversified operations, the collective economy will develop faster and better." On the basis of unified thinking, a comprehensive development plan was formulated. At the same time, we adopted the method of small rectification to rectify the original sideline occupation teams, and used the method of "one divides into two" to summarize the achievements and shortcomings, experiences and lessons of diversified operations in recent years. Finally, according to the production plan, a sideline occupation team was established, responsible for six specialties: pig raising, oil pressing, flour milling, grinding flour, brick making, and artificial insemination; a forestry team was established, responsible for seedling cultivation, seedling protection, and technical guidance for large-scale tree planting around houses and along roadsides; a handicraft team was established, responsible for the manufacture and repair of iron and wood farm tools and the reform of tools; and political cadres were also equipped to establish a political work system. In this way, every industry had a specialist, and everyone had a specialty. Thus, a good situation of agriculture as the main industry and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations appeared.
        Small-Plot Experiments and Large-Field Promotion
    After experiencing the bitterness of failure and tasting the sweetness of success, we understood that we must take the path of small-plot experiments and large-field promotion in agricultural technology.
    In the past few years, we did not pay attention to small-plot experiments. For advanced experiences or new technologies from other places, we often promoted them on a large scale without small-plot experiments. Because these advanced experiences and technologies did not match the specific natural conditions of Nanliu, they often ran counter to our wishes and caused losses to agricultural production.
    Failure is the starting point of progress. Later, we began to pay attention to large-scale experimental fields. However, there was also a ideological struggle on this issue. When we proposed the idea of ​​carrying out large-scale scientific experiments and running small farms, we still encountered great resistance. In order to solve ideological problems and carry out scientific experiments, we first guided everyone to recall our experiences and lessons in agricultural production in recent years. Through production practice, we made everyone realize the relationship between small-plot experiments and large-field promotion. When past experiences and lessons were mentioned, people sighed with emotion, and everyone said: "That year, we promoted the experience of dense planting of corn in the Hewang Brigade. As a result, the corn fields became sugarcane gardens. If we had first carried out small-plot experiments and then promoted them on a large scale, we wouldn't have suffered that loss." On the basis of unified thinking, the small farms were set up. Production teams that were originally unwilling to give land took the initiative to give land, and those who were unwilling to give people took the initiative to give people, and those who were unwilling to give livestock took the initiative to give livestock. Since then, many advanced experiences and technologies have been tested and accepted by the small farm before being promoted to large fields. Some traditional production experiences that have not been clarified in terms of scientific basis must also be re-examined. Therefore, 1965 was not only a year of great agricultural harvest, but also a year of great harvest of agricultural scientific experiments. In 1965, the several experiments we conducted in agricultural production, plus the previous experimental results, yielded a total of seven scientific conclusions suitable for Nanliu's natural conditions, enabling us to overcome blindness and gain command and initiative in guiding agricultural production. For example, regarding the time of wheat sowing, we have not been able to draw a correct conclusion for several years. Therefore, in the past, we basically followed the saying "Wheat is sown for three months, and harvested early and late together." Through experiments, we initially found out the regularity of sowing time. The sowing period experiment in the small farm in 1965 was particularly eye-catching. The results of the harvest were: 603.2 jin per mu sown on September 25, 1964, 572 jin per mu sown on September 30, 548 jin per mu sown on October 5, 412 jin per mu sown on October 9, and 260 jin per mu sown on October 15. The highest and lowest differed by 343.2 jin, and the highest was 132% higher than the lowest. When we organized all cadres and some old farmers to visit the fields, Wang Hongfa said repeatedly: "If you don't compare, you don't know. If you compare, you'll be shocked. Just a different sowing time can result in such a difference in yield. It seems that scientific experiments are essential."
  Be Good at Using Existing Experience and Constantly Creating New Experience
    Everything in the world can be divided into two. Agricultural production experience can also be divided into two. Among our existing production experiences, there are successful ones and failed ones. Some are correct this year, and may be wrong next year. Under this condition, they are correct, and under that condition, they may be wrong. Therefore, in order to continuously improve the level of production, we must correctly combine the flexible use of existing experience with the creation of new experience. If we regard existing experience as absolute and static, we will make mistakes.
    In recent years, the Nanliu Brigade has created many new experiences in agricultural production technology and in the methods of leading agricultural production on the basis of adhering to existing experience, so that the original experience has been enriched and improved, thereby playing a huge role in the development of Nanliu's agricultural production. For example, in terms of land preparation and moisture conservation in cotton autumn fields, we adhered to the traditional farming experience of "scratching the skin of autumn land is better than plowing ten times in spring" and emphasized autumn plowing every year. Later, we absorbed the moisture conservation experience of not disturbing the soil in March in Yangtan Brigade and adopted measures such as early plowing and multiple harrowing to facilitate drought resistance. In terms of cotton topping, we originally adopted the practice of topping strongly in mid-伏according to local experience. Later, we absorbed Yangtan's experience and adopted the method of leaving six leaves when seeing five and leaving eight leaves when seeing seven leaves according to the production plan, and moved the mid-伏 forward to 頭伏, making it more in line with the actual situation of Nanliu Brigade.
    During the cooperation period, the amount of wheat sown per mu was about 13 jin. The most did not exceed 15 jin. In recent years, with the improvement of soil fertility, the amount of sowing per mu has increased to about 18 jin. This amount of sowing is compatible with the soil fertility at that time and people's level of understanding of dense planting. After several years of efforts, the soil fertility of our brigade has been greatly improved. The base fertilizer per mu of wheat field has increased from about 50 dan to more than 70 dan. At the same time, people have further understood the significance of dense planting to increase production and know that appropriately increasing seeds is a shortcut to accelerate the increase of wheat production. Therefore, in 1964, the amount of wheat sown per mu in Nanliu increased from 18 jin in the past few years to 20 jin, which ensured that the effective ears of wheat per mu reached more than 300,000. In the rotation of cotton and wheat crops, we used to think that the yield of wheat with cotton fields back to back cannot be guaranteed. The experience is that cotton and wheat should not meet. However, practice in recent years has proved that by adopting intercropping dense planting and careful management methods, the yield of wheat with cotton fields back to back can catch up with or even exceed that of正茬. In sowing, it started with wide row spacing and narrow sowing width, then narrow row spacing and narrow sowing width, now it is narrow row and multi-sowing, before it was furrow sowing, now it is machine sowing.
    In short, the development and changes of objective things are endless, people's understanding of objective laws is endless, and the experience of agricultural production is endless. Therefore, in agricultural production, we must not only be good at using existing experience, but also be dissatisfied with existing experience, and constantly create new experience.
          Hard Work and Clever Work
    In 1965, the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations in our Nanliu Brigade brought about a sharp contradiction - a serious shortage of labor. The phenomenon of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations competing for labor appeared one after another. The development of forestry and sideline occupations requires an increase in labor, while the new requirements of agricultural production require an increase in many processes, types of work, and labor volume. For a while, sideline cadres would ask for people when they met, while production team cadres would shout that too many people were being drawn away and worried that they would not be able to complete the agricultural production tasks. How to solve this problem? We put the problem on the table for the masses to discuss. In this big discussion centered on "What to do with labor shortage," three opinions emerged. One was the retreat thought. They said: "How much flour, steam how many buns, how many people, do how many things. Anyway, one person cannot become two people. Grasping one thing is better than grasping several things." One was to focus only on the word "hard work." They said: "One person working hard is unstoppable by ten thousand people. As long as we work hard and practically, there is no task that cannot be completed." Most people advocated combining hard work and clever work. They said that if we don't think of a clever way, we won't get good results if we just work hard and struggle. Wang Changyou said word by word: "The thing that pulls the most is the train, the thing that runs the fastest is the rocket, and the thing that flies the highest is the satellite. What do these things rely on? Machines. We want people to make machines and let machines replace people." After careful discussion, the understanding was unified; to make agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations develop at a high speed, we must take the road of tool reform. Spirit can become matter. After mobilization, a mass movement to reform tools was launched. Yang Xuelei, the deputy captain of Team Two, and Wang Hongfa, an old farmer, after painstaking research and repeated experiments, created a cotton cultivator and fertilizer applicator. In order to solve the problem of pulling cotton stalks, carpenter Du Chuanshu spent seven days of hard work and successfully trial-produced a cotton stalk puller. One person and one animal can pull cotton stalks on twenty mu a day, which is three times higher than the original efficiency of pulling cotton stalks on five mu per person per day, and the labor intensity is greatly reduced. In the past, pulling cotton stalks had to be done by strong laborers, but now a semi-auxiliary laborer can also master this tool very well. In the past year, the entire brigade promoted and reformed eleven types of new tools and agricultural machinery, more than 200 pieces, saving more than 7,200 labors, which is equivalent to twenty good laborers working for a year.
    In 1965, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought, we achieved some results, but compared with the Party's requirements for us, there is still a great distance, and compared with many advanced units, there is also a great gap. In order to achieve greater results in the new year, on the basis of summarizing the work in 1965, we further mobilized the broad masses to conduct a large-scale discussion on the work in 1966. After discussion, we put forward the goals. Since entering winter, the Nanliu Brigade, like all parts of the country, has set off a new upsurge in winter production. Because the broad masses have high spirits and great enthusiasm, agricultural production and basic construction are progressing fast and with high quality. Therefore, it is unanimously reflected that if we continue to work like this, the harvest in 1966 will definitely be better than in 1965.

    唯物辩证法威力无穷
    中共山西绛县南柳大队支部书记　周明山
    编者按：本报一九六五年十二月二十四日一版，介绍了南柳大队党支部一切工作以毛泽东思想为纲的经验。在这篇文章里，可以进一步看到，南柳大队党支部在领导生产斗争中，怎样运用毛泽东同志提倡的唯物辩证法的基本观点，来解决生产和工作中的各种问题，逐步改变农村落后面貌，使生产迅速上升。他们在工作中还善于同群众一起商量，及时针对社员的活思想，通过民主讨论，统一认识，使党的方针政策为群众所接受，从而变精神为物质。他们的经验值得大家学习。
      一九六五年是南柳大队遭受特大自然灾害的一年，也是农、林、牧、副全面大发展的一年。
      一九六○年我们就受了一次大旱，可是一九六五年的旱灾更严重。一九六○年干土层达到一尺三，一九六五年干土层达到一尺五。一九六○年旱灾的时间在七月十五日以前，一九六五年从四月二十日到九月四日，没下过一场透雨，从夏到秋旱了一百三十七天。可是，南柳人民高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，终于战胜了重重困难，在大灾之年，取得了农、林、牧、副全面的大丰收、大发展。粮食亩产四百二十六斤，比一九六四年增长了百分之十九点六，粮食亩产过黄河的第一个理想实现了。棉田面积比一九六四年扩大百分之十一点五，亩产九十三斤半，比一九六四年亩产增长了一斤半，总产增长了百分之十三点三。同时，牲口和猪都比一九六四年增长了百分之二十，副业收入增长百分之四十，林业也有了飞跃发展。一九六五年全年收入比一九六四年增长百分之十三。
    为什么能获得这样的好收成呢？近来我们组织群众进行了多次讨论，讨论来，讨论去，大家一致认为，应当归功于毛泽东思想。毛主席辩证法思想的威力是不可估量的。陈希温说得好：“毛主席的思想比泰山还高，比海水还深，比太阳还亮，是威力无穷的精神原子弹。按毛主席的指示办事，大旱灾也能战胜”。
          生产到顶和不断革命
    一九六四年，南柳的农业生产就取得了很大成绩。可是党支部明确地认识到，这只不过象万里长征走完了第一步。所以，在对全年生产进行全面总结的基础上，进一步发动群众制订了一九六五年的生产计划。当我们提出一九六五年的生产计划时，引起了激烈的争论。有些人认为，在农业生产上，我们虽然取得了很大成绩，可是土地的潜力还很大，人的主观能动性还没有充分调动起来，我们的生产成绩和许多先进单位比起来，还有很大距离，而且，不少原来上不了榜的单位已经赶上或超过了我们，所以，必须进一步鼓干劲，争上游，才能不断前进，不断提高。但是，也有一些人持不同见解，他们说：“人常说，知足者常乐嘛！就凭咱南柳这沟深坡陡的干疙瘩，小麦亩产二三百斤，棉花亩产九十多斤，也就很不错了。明年能保住本就行啦。”为了统一思想认识，我们引导大家进一步学习了毛主席“一分为二”的观点，并且开展了一比（条件）、二看
  （产量）的活动，内部和一队比，外部和杨谈大队比。一队在南柳原来是个落后队，坡地占百分之九十以上，可是一九六四年的小麦亩产三百一十四斤，比全大队亩产二百八十三斤半高百分之十点七；棉花亩产一百零三斤，比全大队棉花亩产九十二斤高百分之十一点九。这么一比，许多人没话可说了。接着我们又和杨谈大队比。几年前，我们就提出了“学杨谈、赶杨谈”的口号，可是一直没有赶上。一提起和杨谈比，许多人就打开了话匣子。高广俊说：“咱南柳和杨谈的条件差不多，杨谈的土地朝阳，南柳的土地背阴，各有长短，为啥杨谈的棉花比南柳高一截子？”王天星接着说：“不是南柳的条件差，而是咱们的干劲小，只要我们把干劲鼓足，粮棉产量一定可以赶上杨谈。”比看的结果，一致认为，南柳和杨谈比，有五个不如，即经营管理不如，养猪积肥不如，多种经营不如，集体储备不如，棉花产量不如。最后提出“鼓足干劲干一年，粮棉产量赶杨谈”的口号，并且订出了一九六五年的生产计划。
          抗涝防旱和抗旱防涝
    搞农业生产就是和老天爷打交道，旱灾和涝灾就是老天爷的两出拿手好戏，经常轮换上演。和自然灾害作斗争，主要的就是和旱灾与涝灾作斗争。在以抗涝为主的时候，不能忘了防旱，在以抗旱为主的时候，不能忘了防涝，这样就能使我们经常掌握主动权，永远立于不败之地。
    一九六四年是一个雨多成灾的年头。一年就下了近一千毫米雨，超过平常年降雨量的近一倍，十月份总共只有七个晴天。关系到一九六五年粮棉增产的第一关，是在棉秋田整地和小麦冬季管理上，应该如何对付涝和旱这两种灾害的问题。秋耕的时候，我们就从抗涝和防旱出发，提出秋耕带耙，深耕耙好的要求。可是有些人不同意，说：
  “雨水这么大，水足墒饱，秋耕不耙可以分化土壤，杀死害虫，不如秋耕不耙好。”为了使抗涝和防旱正确地结合起来，做到旱涝双保险，我们引导大家回忆了几年来的抗灾斗争，探讨了自然灾害的规律。多年来，旱涝灾害是交替出现的，往往是旱后有涝，涝后有旱。这里流传着一句农谚是：“大涝之后必有大旱，大旱之后必有大涝。”不过南柳地区也和山西各地一样，是旱灾多于涝灾，所以，在抗涝的时候，必须注意防旱。这样，大家一致认识到，秋耕带耙的这一措施是正确的。全大队一千零二十亩棉秋田做到普耕普耙，卤土地耙了二至三遍。这就保证了作物的按时下种和全苗出土。
    在小麦冬季管理上，同样的问题又发生了。本来小麦冬追冬耙在南柳大队已经是经过实践证明了的好经验，可是由于当年雨水多，底墒足，有些人就产生了麻痹思想，认为小麦不冬耙也能保证增产。还有些人担心由于底墒好，冬季追肥肥效发挥快，不如春天一次追肥好。对此，我们又组织干部、群众进行讨论。经过讨论，统一了思想认识，追肥进度很快，全大队一千二百三十亩麦田，进行了普追普耙。据小农场试验，冬季追肥比春季追肥增产百分之三十以上。
    在一九六五年连续大旱中，我们坚决地进行了抗旱斗争，但仍然注意了防涝。比如棉花采取早追肥、早治虫、早整枝，以便促进棉花早成桃，早开放。这样做，既有利于防涝，也有利于抗旱。凡是早追肥、早管理的棉花，每株平均多结一个半桃，而且桃大绒长，开放早。在麦田方面，我们整修了一百条地堰，更好地保土蓄水。在整地中，我们采取分期平地，挖土不超过一尺，垫土不超过二寸，并且随挖土随平沟，随垫土随耙地的措施。这样做，既有利于防涝，又保证了在大旱无雨的情况下，也能按时种麦，并且全苗出土。
          农业生产和多种经营
    农业生产和多种经营好比车之两轮，鸟之两翼。集体经济有了农业生产和多种经营这两轮两翼，才能越跑越快，越飞越高。
    前几年，由于我们只重视农业，忽视多种经营，所以，农业生产发展快，多种经营发展慢，以至形成“粮棉产量高，社员分红少”的不正常的局面。几年来，经过学习各地的先进经验，特别是学习了汾阳县贾家庄大队以农带副、以副养牧、以牧促农、农林牧副全面发展的经验之后，多数人的思想通了，迫切要求农林牧副全面发展。但是，当我们一九六四年冬季提出农林牧副全面发展的计划时，有的人说：“光抓农业，我们还赶不上人家大寨和杨谈哩，要是再抓多种经营，那就会坐在虎头底下歇凉凉吧（一高一低的意思）。”也有的怕多种经营搞不好，得不了利还得赔本。他们说：“抓一头，得一头，抓两头，丢两头，两头不如一头好”。曾经搞过多年副业的郭玉山说：“有同行，没同利。副业生产咱们年年搞，年年不得利，我看咱们不如散了副业，搞农业。”
    针对上述思想，我们让大家讨论了两个题目：一个是农业生产和多种经营是互相打架呢，还是互相促进呢？一个是多种经营贾家庄能搞好，我们为啥搞不好？同时引导大家总结了几年来多种经营的经验和教训。随着讨论的不断深入，人们的思想逐步统一起来了。李永堂说：“人，一条腿不能走路，鸟，一个翅膀不能飞。毛主席向来就提倡两条腿走路。这几年，我们的集体经济发展得不够快，就是光有农业生产这一条腿，要再安上多种经营这条腿，集体经济就能发展得更快更好。”在统一思想的基础上，制订了全面发展计划。同时，我们采取了小整风的方法，整顿了原有的副业专业队，用一分为二的方法总结了几年来多种经营的成绩和缺点，经验和教训。最后，根据生产计划，建立了一个副业队，负责养猪、榨油、磨面、磨粉、烧窑、配种等六个专业；一个林业队，负责育苗护苗，和大搞四旁植树的技术指导；一个手工业队，负责铁木农具的制造修理和工具改革；还配备了政治干部，建立了政治工作制度。这样一来，业业有专人，人人有专业。于是就出现了一个以农为主，农林牧副全面发展的大好局面。
        小田试验和大田推广
    在吃过失败的苦头和尝到成功的甜头以后，我们懂得了在农业技术上必须走小田试验、大田推广这条路。
    前几年，我们不重视小田试验，对于外地的先进经验或者新的科学技术，往往不经过小田试验，就一下子在大面积上推广。由于这些先进经验和科学技术与南柳的具体自然条件不对路，往往和我们的愿望相反，对农业生产造成了损失。
    失败是进步的起点。以后我们开始注意了大搞试验田。但在这个问题上，也是经过一番思想斗争的。当我们提出大搞科学试验、举办小农场的意见时，仍然遇到了很大的阻力。为了解决思想问题，开展科学试验，我们首先引导大家回忆几年来我们在农业生产上的经验教训。通过生产实践，使大家认识到小田试验和大田推广的关系。一提起过去的经验教训，就引起人们的感慨，大家说：“那年我们推广河王大队玉茭密植的经验，结果玉茭地成了甘蔗园，要是我们先搞小田试验，再大田推广，保险吃不了那个亏。”在统一思想的基础上，小农场办起来了。原来不愿意给地的生产队，主动给地，不愿意给人的，主动给人，不愿意给牲口的，主动给牲口。从此许多先进经验和科学技术，都是首先经过小农场的考验和验收才拿到大田推广，有些没有弄清科学依据的传统生产经验，也要重新进行检验。所以，一九六五年不仅是农业大丰收的一年，也是农业科学试验大丰收的一年。一九六五年，我们在农业生产上作的几项试验，加上以往的试验成果，共得出了七项适合南柳自然条件的科学结论，使我们在指导农业生产上克服了盲目性，取得了指挥权和主动权。如在小麦播种的时间上，几年来，一直没有得出正确的结论，所以，以往我们基本上是按照“麦种三个月，早晚一齐收”的农谚办事。经过试验，初步摸出了播种时间的规律性，一九六五年小农场的播期试验，特别引人注目，收打结果是：一九六四年九月二十五日下种的亩产六百零三斤二两，九月三十日下种的亩产五百七十二斤，十月五日下种的亩产五百四十八斤，十月九日下种的亩产四百一十二斤，十月十五日下种的亩产二百六十斤。最高最低相差三百四十三斤二两，最高比最低高百分之一百三十二。当我们组织所有干部和部分老农到田间参观时，王洪发连声说：“不比不知道，一比吓一跳，光一个播种时间不一样，产量就差这么多，看来，非搞科学试验不可。” 
  善于运用已有经验和不断创造新经验
    世界上的万事万物都是一分为二的。农业生产经验也是一分为二。在我们已有的生产经验中，有成功的，也有失败的。有些在今年是正确的，明年可能是错误的，在这种条件下，是正确的，在那种条件下可能是错误的。所以，为了不断地提高生产水平，就得把活用已有的经验和创造新的经验正确地结合起来。如果，把已有的经验看作是绝对的、静止的、就要犯错误。
    几年来，南柳大队在农业生产技术上和领导农业生产的方法上，在坚持已有经验的基础上，又创造了许多新经验，使原有的经验得到了充实和提高，从而对南柳农业生产的发展，发挥了巨大作用。如在棉秋田的整地保墒方面，坚持了“秋地划破皮，胜过春天犁十犁”的传统的耕作经验，每年强调秋耕。后来，我们吸取了杨谈大队三月不动土的保墒经验，采取了早耕多耙等有利于抗旱的措施。在棉花打杈方面，原来我们根据当地经验采取中伏打强的作法，后来，我们又吸取了杨谈的经验，按照生产计划采取见五留六、见七留八的办法打顶，中伏提前到头伏，使之更符合南柳大队的实际情况。
    小麦播种量，合作化时期，每亩下种十三斤左右。最多的不超过十五斤。最近几年，随着土地肥力的提高，每亩下种量提高到十八斤左右，这个播种量是同当时的土地肥力和人们对于密植的认识水平相适应的。经过几年的努力，我们大队土地肥力有了很大的提高，每亩麦田的底肥由五十担左右，提高到七十担以上，同时，人们对于密植增产的意义，有了进一步的认识，知道了适当增加种籽，是加快提高小麦产量的一条捷径。所以，一九六四年南柳小麦的播种量每亩由过去几年的十八斤，提高到二十斤，这就保证了每亩小麦的有效穗达到三十万个以上。在棉麦作物的倒茬上，过去我们认为棉田回茬小麦不能保证增产，经验是棉麦不见面。但是，几年来的实践证明，采取套种密植和精细管理方法，棉田回茬小麦，产量可以赶上甚至超过正茬。在播种工作上，开始是宽行距窄播幅，以后是窄行距窄播幅，现在是窄行多播，以前是耧播，现在是机播。
    总之，客观事物的发展变化是无穷无尽的，人们对客观规律的认识也是无穷无尽的，农业生产的经验也是无穷无尽的，所以，在农业生产上，必须既善于运用已有的经验，又不满足已有经验，而要不断地创造新经验。
          苦干和巧干
    一九六五年，我们南柳大队的农林牧副全面发展，带来了一个尖锐的矛盾——劳力严重不足。农林牧副各业互相争劳力的现象相继出现。林业、副业要发展，需要增加劳力，而农业生产的新要求，却需要增加许多工序、工种和劳动量。有一段时间副业干部一见面就要人，而生产队干部一见面就叫喊抽人太多，担心完不成农业生产任务。这个问题如何解决？我们就把问题摆出来让群众讨论。在这场以“劳力不足怎么办”为中心的大讨论中，出现了三种意见，一种是下马思想。他们说：“有多少面，蒸多少馍，有多少人，办多少事，反正一个人不能变成两个人，抓一头比抓几头好。”一种是光在“苦”字上作文章。他们说：“一人拼命，万夫难挡。只要苦干实干，没有完不成的任务。”多数人则主张把苦干和巧干结合起来。他们说，要不想个巧法子，光凭苦干硬拼，不会有好结果。王长有一字一板地说：“拉得最多的是火车，跑得最快的是火箭，飞得最高的是卫星。这些东西凭什么？机器。咱就是要人造机器，让机器来代替人。”经过认真讨论以后，认识统一了；要想农林牧副各业高速度地向前发展，必须走工具改革之路。精神可以变物质。经过发动，一个群众性的改革工具的活动开展起来了。二队副队长杨学礼和老农王洪发，经过苦思钻研和反复试验，制成了棉花中耕追肥器。为了解决拔棉柴的问题，木匠杜传书经过七天苦战，试制成功了拔棉柴器，一人一畜一天可以拔棉柴二十亩，比原来每人每天拔棉柴五亩的效率提高了三倍，并且劳动强度大为降低。过去拔棉柴必须是强劳力，现在一个半辅助劳力也能很好地掌握这种工具。一年来，全大队推广和改革新式工具和农业机具十一种，二百多件，约节省劳力七千二百个以上，等于二十个好劳力干一年。
    一九六五年，我们在毛主席思想指引下，虽然取得了一些成绩，但是和党对我们的要求比较，还有很大距离，和许多先进单位比较，也有很大差距。为了在新的一年里取得更大的成绩，我们在总结了一九六五年工作的基础上，进一步发动广大群众，对一九六六年的工作进行了大讨论。经过讨论，提出了奋斗目标。入冬以来，南柳大队和全国各地一样，掀起了一个冬季生产新高潮。由于广大群众情绪高、干劲大，农业生产和基本建设进度快、质量高，所以，一致反映，照这样干法，一九六六年的收成一定比一九六五年更好。
