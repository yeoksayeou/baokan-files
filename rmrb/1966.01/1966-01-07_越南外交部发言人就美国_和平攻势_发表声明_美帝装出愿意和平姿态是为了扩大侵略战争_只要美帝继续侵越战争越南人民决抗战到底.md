    Hanoi, January 5 (Xinhua News Agency) -- Vietnam News Agency reports: The spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 4th regarding the recent so-called "peace efforts" by the United States. The full text is as follows:

    Recently, the US government launched a large-scale fake peace offensive, simultaneously using the means of "suspending bombing" of North Vietnam as a gesture of its "sincerity." US President Johnson has continuously claimed that the US is "determined to utilize all possibilities for peace" and that the US will "relentlessly pursue peace." The US government has dispatched many politicians to foreign countries to engage in activities, putting forward so-called new "peace proposals," but the essence of these proposals is nothing but a rehash of old tunes.

    The fact is, despite the continuous military and political failures of the US, its policy of aggression against Vietnam remains unchanged. The US has shamelessly violated the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, which they once pledged to respect. The US still refuses to withdraw its troops from South Vietnam. The US still stubbornly declares that it must abide by its "promise" to the Saigon puppet government, which it single-handedly fostered, attempting to continue to cling to South Vietnam and permanently divide Vietnam. The US still refuses to recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front—the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam and the leader of the entire South Vietnamese people in resisting the war of aggression by US imperialism. The US still refuses to allow the South Vietnamese people to solve the affairs of South Vietnam themselves in accordance with the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. Not only that, the US is still trying its best to use US troops and puppet troops to destroy villages and damage crops, to kill the people of South Vietnam, and even brazenly demand that the South Vietnamese people lay down their arms to recognize the corrupt Saigon puppet regime. Regarding the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—an independent and sovereign country—US imperialism still blatantly grants itself the right to conduct air raids against it. The US says it "respects the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue," but refuses to accept the four-point stand put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is a concentrated embodiment of the main military and political provisions of this agreement. The US continues to endlessly release the platitude of so-called "unconditional discussions," the true purpose of which is to realize its conspiracy of so-called negotiations from a position of strength, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to accept US conditions.

    The US authorities' peace rhetoric is completely contrary to their war schemes and actions. While the US imperialism is vigorously promoting its "peace efforts," it is frantically preparing to double its troops in South Vietnam. The Third Brigade under the US 25th Division was recently dispatched to Bo Lai Gu; the US openly announced and continues to use chemical poisons as a means of war, and continues to use B-52 strategic bombers to bomb many densely populated areas. Regarding North Vietnam, the US threatens to bomb the industrial areas and residential areas of Hanoi and Haiphong. US aircraft constantly and seriously violate the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, conducting reconnaissance and preparing to create new crimes. US President Johnson also threatened to "take tough measures" in Vietnam. At the same time, the US is strengthening the use of air force to bomb the Laotian liberated areas and brazenly decided to authorize US troops to invade the territories of Central Laos, Lower Laos, and Cambodia, expanding the war from South Vietnam to these two countries.

    Facts have proved that whenever the US authorities prepare to intensify the war of aggression, they talk more about peace. This "peace effort" by the US is only to ease the domestic and international public opinion that is strongly opposed to the US's policy of aggression against Vietnam. The US attempts to use the legitimate desire for peace of the people of the world, to confuse black and white, to pretend that the US is willing to peace, in order to slander the Vietnamese people, and to use this as an excuse to realize new steps in its conspiracy to intensify and expand the war of aggression. However, no matter how hard the US authorities try to use sophistry to cover up their aggressive ambitions, they cannot deceive anyone.

    The US is tens of thousands of miles away from Vietnam. The Vietnamese people have never invaded the US. The US government has no right to send troops to invade South Vietnam, and no right to send air force to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The US government has no right to demand that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam accept this or that condition for stopping the bombing of North Vietnam.

    The aggression of US imperialism is the deep-rooted origin and direct cause of the current serious situation in Vietnam. As long as US imperialism stops its aggression, Vietnam can immediately restore peace.

    The Vietnamese people are very willing to achieve peace to build their own country, but the Vietnamese people clearly realize that true peace must have true independence. The consistent position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to strictly respect the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, and to correctly implement the basic provisions of this agreement, specifically embodied in the following points:

    1. Affirm the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people: peace, independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. According to the Geneva Accords, the US government must withdraw its troops, military personnel, and various weapons from South Vietnam, abolish US military bases in South Vietnam, cancel the "military alliance" with South Vietnam, and at the same time stop its policy of interference and aggression against South Vietnam. According to the Geneva Accords, the US government must stop its war actions against North Vietnam and completely stop all activities that violate the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    2. During the waiting period for Vietnam to achieve peaceful reunification, when Vietnam is still temporarily divided into two regions, it is necessary to thoroughly respect the military provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, such as neither region shall conclude military alliances with foreign countries, nor shall foreign military bases, troops, and military personnel be retained in their own regions.

    3. The affairs of South Vietnam must be resolved by the people of South Vietnam themselves according to the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, without foreign interference.

    4. The issue of realizing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam should be resolved by the Vietnamese people of the two regions themselves, without foreign interference.

    Only when the US government recognizes the four-point stand of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and shows this attitude with practical actions; and at the same time permanently and unconditionally stops the bombing and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, can the political solution of the Vietnam issue be considered.

    The just struggle of the Vietnamese people and the consistent and sincere attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have been continuously sympathized with and strongly supported by peace-loving governments and people all over the world. The Vietnamese people are very grateful for this sympathy and support. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on the socialist countries, the governments and people of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the people of the world, including the American people, to more actively support and assist the patriotic and just struggle of the Vietnamese people, and to more resolutely and powerfully oppose all plans of US imperialism to intensify the war and its schemes of peace deception.

    As long as US imperialism continues to carry out the war of aggression against Vietnam, continues to use US and puppet troops to invade South Vietnam, and continues to use the air force to bomb and strafe the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of North and South Vietnam will never be afraid of sacrifice, resolutely resist to the end, and resolutely complete their sacred task of defending the sovereignty and national independence of the motherland, and making contributions to defending world peace.

### 越南外交部发言人就美国“和平攻势”发表声明  美帝装出愿意和平姿态是为了扩大侵略战争  只要美帝继续侵越战争越南人民决抗战到底

    越南外交部发言人就美国“和平攻势”发表声明
    美帝装出愿意和平姿态是为了扩大侵略战争  只要美帝继续侵越战争越南人民决抗战到底
    新华社河内五日电　越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国外交部发言人四日就美国最近的所谓“和平努力”发表声明，全文如下：
    最近，美国政府展开了一个大规模的假和平攻势，同时使用了“暂停轰炸”越南北方的手段，作为它有“诚意”的姿态。美国总统约翰逊不断地扬言美国“决心利用一切和平的可能性”，美国将“不懈地追求和平”。美国政府派出了许多政客到外国去活动，提出了所谓新的“和平建议”，可是这个建议的实质只不过是老调重弹而已。
    事实是，尽管美国在军事上和政治上连续遭到失败，但它对越南的侵略政策仍然没有改变。美国无耻地破坏了它们曾经保证要尊重的一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。美国仍然不肯把军队撤出越南南方。美国仍然蛮横地宣称美国要遵守对由它一手扶植的西贡走狗政府的“诺言”，妄图继续赖在越南南方和长期分割越南。美国仍然不肯承认越南南方民族解放阵线——越南南方人民唯一真正的代表，全体越南南方人民进行反抗美帝国主义侵略战争的领导者。美国仍然不肯让越南南方人民自己按照越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领解决越南南方的事务。不仅如此，美国仍然竭力使用美国军队和仆从军队去摧毁村庄和破坏庄稼，杀害越南南方人民，甚至悍然要求越南南方人民放下武器来承认腐败的西贡傀儡政权。对于越南民主共和国——一个独立和主权国家，美帝国主义仍然明目张胆地赋予自己对它进行空袭的权利。美国说“尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议”，但却不肯接受越南民主共和国政府所提出的作为这个协议的各项主要军事和政治条款的集中体现的四项主张。美国仍然喋喋不休地放出所谓“无条件讨论”的滥调，而其真正的目的是为了实现它的所谓在实力地位上谈判的阴谋，妄图迫使越南人民接受美国的条件。
    美国当局的和平论调是同它们的战争阴谋和行动完全相反的。美帝国主义在大肆宣扬它的“和平努力”的同时，却疯狂地准备把它们在越南南方的军队增加一倍。美国第二十五师属下的第三旅最近又增派到波来古；美国公开宣布并在继续使用化学毒药作为战争手段，继续使用B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸许多居民稠密的地区。对越南北方，美国威胁要轰炸河内和海防的各个工业区和居民点。美国飞机不断严重地侵犯越南民主共和国的领空，进行侦察，准备制造新的罪恶。美国总统约翰逊还威胁说要在越南“采取强硬的措施”。同时，美国加强使用空军轰炸老挝解放区和悍然决定授权美国军队可以侵入中寮、下寮和柬埔寨领土，把战争从越南南方扩大到这两个国家去。
    事实证明，每当美国当局准备加紧侵略战争时，它便更多地谈论和平。美国这一次的“和平努力”也只是为了缓和正在强烈反对美国对越南的侵略政策的国内外舆论。美国企图利用世界人民正当的和平愿望，颠倒黑白，装出美国愿意和平的姿态，以诬蔑越南人民，并以此为借口来实现其阴谋加紧和扩大侵略战争的新步骤。但是，不管美国当局怎样竭力用诡辩的语言来掩盖其侵略野心，都是骗不了任何人的。
    美国远离越南万里之遥。越南人民从来没有侵犯到美国。美国政府无权派军队来侵略越南南方，无权出动空军轰炸越南民主共和国。美国政府无权要求越南民主共和国政府接受这样或那样的停止轰炸越南北方的条件。
    美帝国主义的侵略是造成越南当前严重局势的深远根源和直接原因。只要美帝国主义停止侵略，越南便立刻可以恢复和平。
    越南人民很愿意取得和平来建设自己的国家，但是越南人民清楚地认识到，要有真正的和平就必须有真正的独立。越南民主共和国政府始终不渝的立场是，严正尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，正确履行这个协议的基本条款，具体体现在以下几点：
    一、确认越南人民的基本民族权利：和平、独立、主权、统一和领土完整。根据日内瓦协议，美国政府必须把美国的军队、军事人员和各种武器从越南南方撤走，撤销美国在越南南方的军事基地，取消同南越的“军事同盟”，同时停止对越南南方的干涉和侵略政策。根据日内瓦协议，美国政府必须停止对越南北方的战争行动，完全停止侵犯越南民主共和国领土和主权的一切活动。
    二、在等待越南实现和平统一期间，在越南还暂时被分割为两个地区的时候，必须彻底尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的各项军事条款，如两地区都不得同外国缔结军事同盟，不得在自己的地区保留有外国的军事基地、军队和军事人员。
    三、越南南方事务必须由越南南方人民根据越南南方民族解放阵线纲领自己来解决，不许外国干涉。
    四、实现越南和平统一的问题，应由两个地区的越南人民自己来解决，不许外国干涉。
    只有当美国政府承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，并用实际行动来表明这种态度；同时永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，那么才能考虑到越南问题的政治解决。
    越南人民的正义斗争和越南民主共和国政府始终如一的具有诚意的态度，不断得到全世界爱好和平的政府和人民的同情和有力支持。越南人民十分感激这种同情和支持。越南民主共和国政府呼吁社会主义各国，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的政府和人民，以及包括美国人民在内的全世界人民，更加积极地支持和援助越南人民的爱国正义斗争，更加坚决和有力地反对美帝国主义一切强化战争的计划与和平欺骗的阴谋。
    只要美帝国主义还继续进行侵略越南的战争，还利用美国和仆从军队侵略越南南方，还利用空军轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国，越南北方和南方的人民就决不怕牺牲，坚决抗战到底，坚决完成自己的神圣任务，保卫祖国的主权和民族独立，为保卫世界和平作出贡献。
