    The situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield is excellent. A strategic situation of encircling the cities from the countryside has been irrevocably established. The vast liberated areas are becoming increasingly consolidated, and the South Vietnamese people's armed forces are continuously tightening the encirclement of the isolated strongholds of the U.S. and its puppets. Popular discontent is boiling over in the enemy-occupied areas, and flames are raging everywhere. The U.S. aggressors and their running dogs are, in fact, in a predicament of being attacked from both inside and outside. As the recent communique of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command pointed out, "The truth that the Vietnamese people will surely win and the U.S. imperialist aggressors will surely be defeated is clearer than ever." This situation is obvious to all. The following excerpts from reports by two American bourgeois journalists also reluctantly reveal some of the facts.
    Associated Press reporter Wheeler cabled from Saigon on January 25:
    Three-quarters of South Vietnam is controlled by the Viet Cong—or not controlled by anyone.
    This is the opinion of authorities who have seen the Saigon government's control in the provinces weakened—even after the arrival of nearly 200,000 U.S. troops.
    These people say that the government controls less than a quarter of the land today—control in the sense that the government administrative apparatus is functioning in all respects.
    Of the forty-five provinces in Vietnam, only two are considered to be completely under government control—Gia Dinh province around Saigon and An Giang province.
    Even in some areas under government control, Viet Cong underground elements operate freely, and government and U.S. troops are always in danger of being ambushed. Saigon police have fought with Viet Cong military units in the outskirts of the capital.
    In the past month, two county towns have been abandoned due to excessive Viet Cong pressure. They are located less than thirty miles from the U.S. Marine Corps bridgehead, but this did not save the counties of Minh Long and Hiep Duc.
    The Communists must feel very confident from their past achievements and from the fact that the Allied forces have so far failed to induce the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese army to engage in a showdown battle.
    Despite being subjected to air strikes and activities by U.S. and Vietnamese troops in their base areas, the Viet Cong continue to attack with fanaticism.
    Reliable sources, in estimating the situation, say that the government and the Viet Cong each control about a quarter of the country, with the other half being disputed territory.
    Government control in these disputed areas is usually limited to scattered strongholds that only protect their own barbed wire. But the Viet Cong are often able to enter villages at night and carry out their propaganda. Government village chiefs and police often spend the night in county headquarters buildings behind barbed wire. Although government troops repeatedly sweep these disputed areas, the Viet Cong return immediately when the government troops return to their barracks.
    Government control is weakest in the northernmost First Military Region. In each province, its control is largely limited to the provincial capital and surrounding rural areas of varying sizes. The U.S. Marine Corps has a bridgehead in Chu Lai, but there is not much population here. The other bases of the Marine Corps are in Da Nang and not far south of Hue.
    In addition to Hiep Duc and Minh Long, several county towns have been abandoned in the past eighteen months, and in some other county towns, the government-controlled areas are in a precarious situation.
    The situation in the southern part of the Second Military Region..., including most of the highlands, is better than in the north, where some of the biggest battles of the war have taken place, including the battle in the Ia Drang Valley between U.S. troops and North Vietnamese regular troops.
    In the Third Military Region, the government's main center of control is roughly shaped like an arrow, with Saigon at the base of the arrow and the tip at the sea.
    For several years, great efforts have been made to pacify Long An and Hau Nghia provinces directly west and northwest of Saigon, but little progress has been made. In fact, the government has lost some ground in some areas.
    In the Fourth Military Region (the Mekong Delta battlefield), outside of the provinces controlled by the Hoa Hao sect, government control is at best point control.
    *U.S. News & World Report* magazine published a Saigon dispatch in its January 24 issue entitled "The Untold Story of the Vietnam War," which wrote:
    There are two wars going on here in South Vietnam—one well known, and the other not known.
    The well-known war involves bombing raids, American soldiers, jungle warfare, and Viet Cong camps.
    The untold story takes place in the countryside and Saigon: widespread terror, insecurity, rampant inflation, speculation, food shortages... In this other war—actually the main one—America is losing.
    The internal situation in South Vietnam is worse now than it was when the U.S. began shipping in large numbers of troops last spring.
    In the first week of January, Communist guerrilla activity set new records: 1,100 sabotage, attack, and kidnapping "incidents," double the number of a year ago. South Vietnam's distribution system has been severely disrupted, causing shortages and high prices. For example, in the Saigon area, grain prices have doubled in six months, and the prices of chicken, cooking oil, and other foods have risen even more sharply. Rents and clothing prices have also increased.
    In some areas, the black market is rampant and out of control. The big cities are filled with an atmosphere of cheap entertainment, with nouveau riche merchants and builders everywhere, a scent of corruption. The $600 million in economic aid that the U.S. poured into the country last year seems to have disappeared.
    The Americans promised to prop up the South Vietnamese government with massive rural aid, by persuading people that they could have a better life if they supported the government. But even in relatively safe areas, the plans to win over the peasants have fallen far short of success.
    Take a look at the First Military Region, and you'll see what's happening. The First Military Region has five provinces. This area is under the responsibility of the U.S. Marine Corps. The Marine Corps has more than one division here, spreading out from the strategically important air base in Da Nang and the newly built Chu Lai base. But right outside Da Nang in Quang Nam, Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai provinces, security inside the First Military Region has deteriorated even more than it was before the Marine Corps arrived. The situation in the two provinces north of Da Nang is also deteriorating.

### 今日南越是谁家天下？

专栏：外论摘要

    今日南越是谁家天下？
    南越战场的形势好得很。一个农村包围城市的战略局面，已经无可改变地确定了下来。广大的解放区日益巩固，南越人民武装力量不断紧缩对美伪孤立据点的包围圈。敌占区内民怨沸腾，烈火四起。美国侵略者和它的走狗实际上处在内外夹攻的困境。正如越南南方解放武装力量指挥部最近发表的公报指出的，“越南人民必胜，美帝国主义侵略者必败这一真理，比任何时候都更加明显”。这种形势是有目共睹的。这里发表的两篇美国资产阶级记者的报道摘要，也无可奈何地道出了一些事实真相。
    美联社记者惠勒一月二十五日从西贡发出电讯写道：
    南越四分之三是由越共控制的——或无人控制。
    这是看到西贡政府在各省的控制权削弱——甚至在将近二十万美军到达以后也是这样——的权威人士的意见。
    这些人士说，政府今天控制的土地不到四分之一——所说的控制是指政府行政机构在各个方面进行工作而言。
    在越南的四十五个省份中，只有两个省份被认为是完全处在政府控制之下——西贡周围的嘉定省和安嘉省。
    甚至是在属于政府控制的一些地区中，越共地下分子也自由活动，政府军和美军总是有遭到伏击的危险。西贡警察曾在首都的近郊与越共军事部队交过战。
    在过去一个月中，有两个县城由于越共的压力太大而放弃了。它们是在离美国海军陆战队桥头堡不到三十英里的地方，但是这并未使明龙和协德这两个县城得救。
    共产党从他们过去取得的成就以及从盟军迄今为止未能诱使越共或北越军在战场上进行一次摊牌战这一点来看，一定感到很有信心。
    越共虽然受到空袭的袭击，而且美越军队在他们的大本营地区进行活动，他们仍然继续抱着狂热的精神进行攻击。
    可靠人士在估计这个局势时说，政府和越共各控制这个国家的大约四分之一，另外一半是有争议的地区。
    政府在这些有争议的地区的控制通常只是分散的据点，这些据点只保护它们自己的铁丝网。但越共却常常能够在夜间进入村庄，贯彻他们的宣传。政府的村长和警察常常是在铁丝网后面的县总部建筑物中过夜的。　虽然政府军一再扫荡这些有争议的地区，当政府军返回他们的营房时，越共就马上回来了。
    政府的控制在最北部的第一军区是最弱的。在每个省，它的控制大体上只限于省会及其周围的面积不等的乡区。美国海军陆战队在朱莱有一个桥头堡，但是这里没有很多的人口。海军陆战队的其它基地是在岘港和在顺化以南不远的地方。
    除了协德和明龙以外，在过去十八个月中还有几个县城被放弃，在其它一些县城，政府军控制区岌岌可危。
    包括大部分高地在内的第二军区……的南部的情况比北部好，在那里发生了这场战争中的一些最大的战斗，包括美军与北越正规军在德浪河谷的战斗。
    在第三军区，政府的主要控制中心大体象一个箭头，西贡是箭头的底部，尖端是海。
    几年来为绥靖西贡正西和西北的隆安省和厚义省而进行了很大的努力，但是没有取得什么进展。事实上，政府在一些地区失去了一些地盘。
    在第四军区（三角洲战场），在和好教控制的省份以外，政府的控制最多也只是对点的控制。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志一月二十四日一期发表一篇题为《没有讲述过的越南战争故事》的西贡通讯写道：
    在南越这里进行着两个战争——一个是众所周知的，另一个是不为人所知的。
    众所周知的战争包含轰炸机的轰炸，美国兵，丛林战，越共营。
    没有讲述过的故事却发生在乡下和西贡：广泛的恐怖行动，不安全，急剧的通货膨胀，投机倒把，粮食缺乏……在这另一个战争——实际上是主要的——里，美国正在失利。
    与去年春季美国开始运进大量部队的时候比较起来，现在南越内部的情况更加糟糕了。
    一月的第一个星期中，共产党的游击活动开创了新的纪录：破坏、袭击、绑架“事件”达一千一百次，为一年前的一倍。南越的分配系统遭到严重的破坏，造成物资缺乏、物价高涨。例如，在西贡地区，六个月里，粮价涨了一倍，鸡、食油和其他食品的价格涨得更凶。房租和服装价格也上涨了。
    在一些地区，黑市猖獗失去了控制。在大城市里充满了低级娱乐的气氛，到处是暴发的商人和建筑业者，一片腐化的气息。去年，美国倾入这个国家的六亿美元的经济援助似乎已经消失了。
    美国人答应过用大规模的对乡村援助、用说服人们如果他们支持政府就可以得到更好的生活这些方法来为南越政府撑腰。但是，甚至在比较安全的地区，争取农民的计划也远远没有成功。
    瞧一下第一军区，你就会知道发生了什么事情。第一军区有五个省。这个地区交由美国海军陆战队负责。海军陆战队在这里有一师多人，他们从岘港的在战略上具有重要地位的空军基地和新建的朱莱基地向外散开。但是，就在岘港外面的广南省和广信省、广义省，第一军区内部的安全比海军陆战队到达以前更加恶化了。岘港以北两个省份的情况也正在恶化。
