    Using Materialist Dialectics to Do a Good Job in Ideological Transformation Work of Soldiers
    Instructor of the "Model Red Ninth Company" in Studying Chairman Mao's Writings, Chen Jinyuan
    The discussion in *Liberation Army Daily* on "How to View the Advanced and Backward with a Development and Change Perspective?" is of great interest to us. It is a great promotion for us to use materialist dialectics to do ideological work for soldiers.
    The political and ideological work of the company is to do the ideological transformation work of soldiers, that is, to arm the soldiers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly consolidate and expand the ideological position of the proletariat, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, make Mao Zedong Thought take root in the soldiers' minds, and make the backward become advanced and the advanced become even more advanced. To do this work well, we must first have a revolutionary sense of career and responsibility for the cause of the Party, for the construction of the company, and for the lifelong revolution of the soldiers. At the same time, we must also have correct thinking methods and working methods. What are the correct thinking methods and working methods? It is materialist dialectics. In our actual work, we deeply realize that when we pay attention to using dialectics, the work has good results, and when we commit the fault of metaphysics and look at problems subjectively and one-sidedly, we suffer. No matter how much effort is spent, the effect is not good. Below, I will talk about some of our experiences in using materialist dialectics to do a good job in the work of advanced and backward comrades.
    We must make a correct analysis of backward comrades
    In the past, we regarded some backward comrades as very poor. We unconsciously treated them coldly and criticized them too much. This made them lose confidence in progress and made other comrades lack confidence in helping them. What is the reason? The main reason is that we cannot use the method of "one divides into two" to conduct a fundamental analysis of them. We took their shortcomings too seriously, looked at them one-sidedly, and regarded them as dead ends. We saw three points of shortcomings as five points, and we saw general problems as essential problems. Therefore, we did not believe that they could make progress.
    There was a soldier in the first squad who often made mistakes after joining the army. Once, during a night search training exercise, he was assigned to be the simulated enemy. When his comrades searched for him, they couldn't find him. They searched until late at night without a trace. It turned out that he had run back to the barracks to rest by himself. Because he had problems time and time again, everyone saw only his shortcomings, not his strengths. There was more and more criticism, and sometimes the criticism was inaccurate. He was even criticized for doing good deeds, and the relationship became more and more tense. In order to help this comrade make progress, we organized the key members of the first squad to use the method of "one divides into two" to conduct a fundamental analysis of him. First, we asked everyone to list his advantages and disadvantages, and then we analyzed the nature of these advantages and disadvantages. Everyone saw that his advantages were essential and his disadvantages were non-essential. The more we analyzed, the clearer our minds became. Our understanding changed, and the attitude of the comrades in the squad also changed towards him. They seized on his advantages and talked about them repeatedly, often praising him. They adopted the method of "attacking each one separately" for his shortcomings, eliminating them one by one. This method greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of this soldier and finally brought about a major transformation.
    From this, we have come to realize that we must have a fundamental analysis of our soldiers. Soldiers' thinking is divided into two, with both positive and negative factors, both advantages and disadvantages. However, these two aspects are by no means half and half. Generally speaking, positive factors are always the essence and the main stream. Compared with advanced comrades, backward comrades have more shortcomings and progress more slowly; but this does not mean that negative factors are their essence and main stream. The vast majority of our soldiers are children of workers and peasants, and their personal interests are fundamentally consistent with the interests of the revolution. They all want to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and actively demand to make progress. Some of the old ideas and old habits in them can be gradually overcome through self-transformation.
    Having a fundamental analysis of backward comrades will give us deep class feelings for them and fill us with confidence in their progress. Without a fundamental analysis, looking at problems subjectively and one-sidedly, we will pile up their shortcomings and treat some non-essential and temporary negative phenomena as essential things. This will lead to the point of view of stagnation, the point of view of pessimism, and a lack of enthusiasm in helping them.
    Having a fundamental analysis of backward comrades will also promote backward comrades to correctly understand themselves. Because backward comrades have more shortcomings, they tend to commit the fault of "one-sidedness" when looking at themselves and lack confidence in progress. We often encounter such situations: if the leadership believes that backward comrades can make progress, their confidence is stronger, their motivation is greater, and they can make more progress; if the leadership does not believe in them, their emotions are not very high, their motivation is not very strong, and their progress is slow. The phenomenon of backward comrades rising and falling, sometimes up and sometimes down, in the process of progress is closely related to whether our views on them are correct and whether our work is right.
    Guiding backward comrades to consciously carry out ideological transformation
    Chairman Mao said: "Materialist dialectics holds that external causes are the conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes." To do the ideological transformation work of backward comrades, the most important thing is to rely on them to take the initiative to carry out ideological "fighting," and consciously transform themselves. Only through their own ideological "fighting" can backward comrades make the proletarian ideology in their minds defeat the non-proletarian ideology and transform from backward to advanced. If they don't have ideological "fighting," but only others "fight" with their ideology, not only will they not win, but they will also become stubborn and create a deadlock.
    However, external causes also play an important role in the development of things. The help of leaders and comrades has a great influence on the transformation of a backward comrade. We must never one-sidedly emphasize the role of internal causes, shirk the responsibility of helping backward comrades, and relax our help to them. Of course, external causes must play a role through internal causes. Helping backward comrades must highlight politics, grasp living ideas, and inspire backward comrades to carry out the ideological struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating capitalist ideology, and improve their ideological awareness. The political instructor is the commander on the political and ideological front of the company. Our battlefield is inside the soldiers' minds. Our task is to help soldiers fight the ideological battle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating capitalist ideology well. The more powerfully we do our work, and the more we hit the point, the better the ideological battle of backward comrades will be fought, and the faster they will progress. If we are not proactive in our work and our methods are not correct, it will affect their ability to fight the ideological battle well.
    To help backward comrades fight the ideological battle, we must grasp the fundamental, grasp the transformation of world outlook. That is, we must do a good job in the work of instilling Mao Zedong Thought, and do everything possible to instill Mao Zedong Thought into the minds of backward comrades bit by bit. We must help them to study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, focusing on the main problems of backward comrades. Encourage them after learning, praise them after using, and help them summarize after using well. Guide them to connect with reality, and work hard on the word "use," constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize non-proletarian ideology. In this way, Mao Zedong Thought can occupy the position step by step in their minds, take root, and transform from backward to advanced. There was a soldier in the fourth squad who had many shortcomings. When he began to study Chairman Mao's writings, he did not pay attention to contacting his thoughts, saying one thing and doing another. For example, he said "one divides into two" in words, but in reality, he only saw his advantages and only saw others' shortcomings, and he could not do a good job of unity in the squad. Once, I came across him studying an article about "one divides into two," and I asked him, "How's the learning going?" He said, "The principle Chairman Mao talks about is easy to understand, let me tell you about it!" I said, "How about this, you use the viewpoint of 'one divides into two' to analyze your own thoughts well, and tell me about it tomorrow." He was very happy to hear this, and after returning, he shook out all his advantages and wrote them on paper. He was just about to talk to me, but after thinking about it, he felt that something was wrong. He thought: the instructor asked me to talk about "one divides into two," and I only look for my own advantages, isn't this the theory of one point! Through ideological "fighting," he made a comprehensive analysis of his advantages and disadvantages. After listening, I praised him and said, "Learned well, put it into use!" He was very happy. Later, he further used the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to find out the advantages of each comrade in the squad, and compared himself to find eight gaps. He overcame them one by one in his actual work, and his thinking greatly improved. He said with deep understanding: "To study 'one divides into two,' we must learn to divide, but also to fight. If you can divide, you can see clearly the advanced and backward ideas in your mind; if you can fight, you can use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome your backward ideas and continue to move forward."
    To help backward comrades fight the ideological battle well, we must also consider the characteristics of each individual. Some have many problems, and some have few problems; some accept problems slowly, and some accept problems quickly. Therefore, we must analyze specifically, treat them differently, and not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. If we do not differentiate, and cook sorghum and rice in the same pot, some will be raw and some will be cooked, and the effect will not be good.
    To do a good job in the work of backward comrades, we must also pay full attention to relying on key members, mobilizing the masses, and turning the company into a red furnace, creating a good environment for the transformation of backward comrades. That is to say, we must create a strong atmosphere in the company for studying Chairman Mao's writings, a strong political atmosphere, and a strong sense of principle, so that everyone cares about a person with problems, everyone helps a person with shortcomings, and there are warm hands everywhere. In such a red furnace, backward comrades will be refined into strong red successors. If we do not fully rely on key members, mobilize the masses, and everyone does ideological work, then the education work for backward comrades will not have strength. In this way, it will not be conducive to the transformation of backward comrades in the advanced direction.
    The transformation of backward to advanced is a repeated struggle process
    The transformation of backward to advanced is not a simple matter. It often has to go through a long and arduous process of ideological struggle.
    To establish proletarian ideology, we must overcome non-proletarian ideology; to develop a style of hard struggle, we must overcome a lazy and loose style; to establish the viewpoint of materialist dialectics, we must overcome the viewpoint of metaphysics. The old ideas and old habits on backward comrades, although not the main stream, are not formed in a day or two. Some problems have been formed for a long time and have deep roots. To break these old ideas and old habits, and establish new ideas and new habits, is a very arduous task. For example, for a small matter like marching, some comrades originally took streetcars even for two *li* at home. Suddenly, asking them to march a hundred *li* in one night will inevitably involve a difficult ideological struggle. It is not surprising that individual comrades cannot stand the pressure, complain a little, or lag behind a little. They can only establish the idea of ​​not being afraid of hardship or fatigue through continuous struggle with difficulties and through practical exercise. In the past, we did not sufficiently recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the transformation of backward to advanced, and we hated them for not living up to our expectations. We were eager to achieve success in our work and demanded that they quickly get rid of all their problems, just like an impatient cook who only cares about adding firewood to the stove, regardless of whether the rice in the pot can stand it or not. As a result, good intentions did not do good deeds, and backward comrades became more and more discouraged.
    The transformation of backward to advanced is a process from quantitative change to qualitative change. Only when it reaches a certain degree can it make rapid progress and a leap. In the beginning of the transformation, they will not recognize problems as clearly as advanced comrades, nor will they handle problems as correctly as advanced comrades. There will often be a phenomenon of separation between thought and action. Some comrades follow along in action, but their ideological understanding is not so conscious; others have improved their understanding, but have not immediately followed up in action. We feel that this kind of transformation of backward comrades, although still very inconspicuous, is a progressive red signal and a growing advanced seedling. We must seize these signs as a breakthrough to help them transform, and patiently and meticulously carry out our work, promoting their progress with full enthusiasm. If they have good actions, even if their understanding is not enough, we should not say that their "motives are impure," but should help them improve their understanding on the basis of their actions; if they have a certain understanding, even if their actions have not kept up, we should not say that their "words and deeds are inconsistent," but should guide them to implement correct ideas into actions, and step by step promote them to transform in the advanced direction. Otherwise, we will not be able to help them progress in a timely and effective manner.
    Backward comrades generally experience reversals in the process of progress, with emotions sometimes high and sometimes low, sometimes up and sometimes down. This is a normal situation. Without several reversals, we cannot completely solve the problem of who will win between new and old ideas and new and old habits, and we cannot make Mao Zedong Thought truly take root. We must admit reversals, recognize reversals, study the causes of reversals, and grasp the laws of changes in people's thinking, so that we can minimize reversals. There was a soldier in the sixth squad who often quarreled and made trouble because he had been contaminated with some old habits in society. At first, he quarreled with the squad leader. I thought he was young and naive, so I talked to him individually. He made a self-criticism, and I felt that this problem had been solved. After a period of time, he quarreled with someone else again and didn't even want to participate in the drill. I educated him again, and he said that he would resolutely correct his shortcomings. Who knew that not long after, he had a falling out with another comrade and was so angry that he didn't even eat. He went to the street to buy biscuits without asking for leave. Why did this soldier's problem occur again and again? After careful analysis and research, the reason was finally clarified. On the one hand, his old problems had not been completely transformed, and there was a stubborn force of habit; on the other hand, he also had the desire to improve, and he was very regretful after making mistakes. In this way, there were two forces in his thinking, like a tug-of-war, you pulled over, I pulled over, and a fierce struggle was going on, forming a repeated phenomenon of making mistakes and making self-criticisms, making self-criticisms and making mistakes again. Later, I focused on this characteristic of him and helped him study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, and conducted ideological work continuously to fundamentally improve his class consciousness. At the same time, I asked everyone to create conditions for him to progress and not to create conditions for him to make mistakes. Through a long period of help, this comrade's shortcomings were gradually overcome.
    Practical work has made us realize that the ideological changes of soldiers are very complex, and our understanding and work cannot be simplified. To do the work of backward comrades, we must have the spirit of grasping and not letting go, and grasping it to the end. We must fight a "protracted war" and cannot rest on our laurels. In the beginning, we must encourage them to dare to "bayonet" with their old ideas. When they have achieved some victories, we must encourage them to fight continuously; when advanced ideas are in the dominant position, we must encourage them not to relax; when negative factors are in the upper hand, we must give them "hot air" and educate them not to be pessimistic and discouraged. In any case, we must divide backward comrades into two, and we cannot think that it is almost the same because they have made some progress for a while; nor can we lose confidence because they have temporarily experienced twists and turns. We must unremittingly guide them to consciously carry out ideological revolution. We must also divide the advanced into two to promote the advanced to be more advanced.
    Advanced and backward are a unity of opposites and can be transformed into each other. Backward can become advanced, and advanced can become more advanced, or it can become backward. Advanced and backward are relative, and we must also use the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to view advanced comrades, promote advanced to be more advanced, and prevent advanced from becoming backward. In the past, we had two one-sidednesses in looking at advanced comrades. One was to think that they were good to the top and not pay attention to grasping the weak links. The other was to not believe that they were truly advanced and to negate their advancement by seizing on a little shortcoming. Why do we make such mistakes? The main reason is the lack of the viewpoint of "one divides into two."
    Advanced comrades have more advantages and higher ideological awareness. However, they also have non-proletarian ideas, also have weak links, and are prone to pride, relax ideological transformation, maintain vanity, and lose the fundamentals. We must divide them into two, and we cannot be biased towards them and condone them. We must educate them to divide themselves into two and establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution. We must take a responsible attitude, make strict demands, and help them overcome weak links. In particular, their study of Chairman Mao's writings must not only not be relaxed, but also require them to grasp it more tightly, learn more, understand more deeply, and use it better. When grasping weak links, we must grasp those problems that are fundamental in nature. Do not spin around on some life details, making them cautious and unable to focus their attention on overcoming major shortcomings.
    In our actual work, we have also made another kind of one-sidedness, requiring advanced soldiers to be perfect. We are surprised by their shortcomings, especially for comrades who have changed from backward to advanced, and we often negate the whole picture by seizing on a little shortcoming. As a result, the enthusiasm of these comrades has been frustrated. There was a comrade named Liu Guoliang in our company. When he first came to the company, he was a well-known "spoiled soldier." Later, he seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, and his ideological outlook underwent great changes. He entered the ranks of advanced soldiers. Although his advantages were more prominent, he still had some shortcomings. Some comrades seized on these shortcomings and blew "cold air" indiscriminately. Once, he broke into the company headquarters without reporting. When he saw that there were leaders in the room, he retreated. Some comrades said: "Look, it's still the same old way!" This caused his work morale to drop for a while. Later, we educated these comrades, so that they realized that: Compared with his advantages, Liu Guoliang's shortcomings are the problem of one finger and nine fingers. We must never offset his main and advanced side because he has some shortcomings. It is right to make strict demands on advanced soldiers, but the strictness must be practical and reasonable, and must not exceed the limit. For their shortcomings, we must analyze them specifically, and not regard secondary problems as principal problems, accidental problems as consistent problems, or practical problems as ideological problems. In this way, it will truly be conducive to mobilizing their positive factors and overcoming their weak links.
    To make the advanced more advanced, in addition to grasping their weak links, we must also focus on their advanced factors, promote the continued development of advanced factors, and make them more prominent. If the advanced factors are highlighted, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is raised higher, the awareness of overcoming negative factors is stronger, and the strength is greater. With the mirror of proletarian ideology, non-proletarian ideology can be seen more clearly; with the ruler of materialist dialectics, the idea of ​​metaphysics can be seen more accurately. Not paying attention to grasping advanced factors and simply grasping shortcomings can easily make advanced soldiers confused, making them unclear about the direction and hesitating, and their advantages will be difficult to give full play, and it will be difficult to create or advance. There was an advanced comrade in our company who summed up his experience in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide military training at the beginning of last year, and introduced it to fraternal companies, which was very popular. Some comrades, out of good intentions, believed that the key to advanced was to grasp their shortcomings severely. They did not pay attention to promoting his spirit of hard study and daring to create. On the contrary, they criticized and criticized him too much for some of his shortcomings in life. As a result, the comrade grabbed the small and lost the big. He only focused on correcting some shortcomings in life, and the good side was not fully developed, and he stagnated for a time. We learned from this lesson and realized that we must not only help advanced comrades overcome their shortcomings, but also help them develop their advantages; at the same time, we must also pay attention to educating advanced comrades to vigorously promote advanced factors and promote the revolutionary spirit while overcoming weak links, and strive for the advanced to be more advanced. In this way, a upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced has been set off. The atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's writings is stronger, and positive factors have been further developed.
    I feel that using materialist dialectics to do a good job in the transformation work of turning the backward into the advanced and the advanced into the more advanced is a process of continuous learning, continuous practice, and continuous improvement. In this regard, I have not done enough. In the future, I am determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, strengthen my own ideological revolutionization, try to make the dialectics in my mind more and the metaphysics less, and do the ideological transformation work of soldiers better.

    运用唯物辩证法做好战士思想转化工作
    “学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”指导员　陈金元
    《解放军报》关于“怎样用发展变化的观点来看待先进和后进？”的讨论，使我们很感兴趣。对我们运用唯物辩证法做好战士的思想工作，是一个很大的促进。
    连队政治思想工作，就是做战士的思想转化工作，就是用毛泽东思想武装战士的头脑，不断巩固和扩大无产阶级的思想阵地，克服各种非无产阶级思想，使毛泽东思想在战士头脑里扎根，使后进变先进，先进更先进。要做好这个工作，首先要有为党的事业着想，为连队建设着想，为战士一辈子革命着想的革命事业心和责任感。同时，还要有正确的思想方法和工作方法。什么是正确的思想方法和工作方法呢？就是唯物辩证法。我们在实际工作中深深体会到，凡是注意运用辩证法的时候，工作就有好的效果，凡是犯形而上学的毛病，看问题主观片面的时候，就吃苦头。花的劲再大，效果也不好。下面就谈一谈我们运用唯物辩证法，做好先进和后进同志工作的一些体会。对后进同志要作正确的分析
    过去，我们把一些后进的同志，看得很差劲。自觉不自觉地对他们态度冷淡，批评过多。使他们失去了进步的信心，也使其他同志缺乏帮好的信心。原因在哪里呢？主要的是不能用一分为二的方法，对他们进行根本的分析。把他们的缺点看重了，看偏了，看死了。把三分的缺点看成五分，把一般的问题看成是本质问题，因此，不相信他们能够进步。
    一班有个战士，入伍以后经常出漏子。有一次夜间搜索训练，让他当假设敌，等同志们搜索的时候，找不到他了，一直找到深夜，连个影也没有。原来他一个人跑回营房休息去了。由于他一次又一次地出问题，在大家的眼里就净是缺点，没有优点了。批评越来越多，有时批评得也不准确，甚至办了好事也批评他，关系越闹越僵。为了帮助这个同志进步，我们就组织一班骨干运用一分为二的方法，对他进行了一次根本的分析。先让大家把他的优点、缺点都摆出来，然后又分析这些优点、缺点的性质。大伙一看，他的优点都是本质的，缺点都是非本质的。这样越分析头脑越清楚。认识转变了，班里同志对他的态度也变了。他们抓住他的优点反复讲，经常表扬，对他的缺点采取各个击破的方法，一个一个的打歼灭战，这个办法大大地调动了这个战士的积极性，终于有了大转变。
    从这里我们体会到，对我们的战士，一定要有个根本的分析。战士的思想都是一分为二的，有积极因素也有消极因素，有优点也有缺点。但是，这两个方面绝不是一半对一半。一般地说，积极因素总是本质，总是主流。后进的同志和先进同志比较起来，缺点是多一些，进步是慢一些；但并不能因此就说消极因素是他们的本质和主流。我们的战士绝大多数都是工农子弟，他们的个人利益和革命的利益根本上是一致的；他们都愿意当一个毛主席的好战士，积极要求上进；他们身上的一些旧思想、旧习惯，是能够通过自我改造逐步克服的。
    对后进同志有一个根本分析，对他们就会有深厚的阶级感情，对他们的进步就会充满信心。如果没有一个根本的分析，主观地、片面地看问题，就会把他们的缺点堆成堆，把一些非本质的、暂时的消极现象，当成了本质的东西。就会产生停止的论点，悲观的论点，对他们的帮助缺乏热情。
    对后进同志有一个根本的分析，也会促进后进同志正确认识自己。后进同志由于缺点比较多，看待自己，往往容易犯一点论的毛病，对进步缺乏信心。我们常常遇到这样的情形：领导上相信后进同志能够进步，他们的信心就强，干劲就大，就越能进步；领导上不相信他们，他们情绪就不大高，劲头就不大足，进步也就慢。后进同志在进步过程中时起时落、忽上忽下的现象，往往和我们对他们的看法是不是正确，工作是不是对头，有着密切的联系。引导后进同志自觉地进行思想改造
    毛主席说：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”做后进同志的思想转化工作，最重要的是要靠他们自己主动地进行思想“打架”，自觉改造自己。后进同志只有通过自己思想“打架”，才能使他们头脑里的无产阶级思想战胜非无产阶级思想，从后进转变为先进。如果自己思想不“打架”，只是别人和他们的思想“打架”，不仅打不赢，还会顶起牛来，造成僵局。
    但是，外因对事物的发展，也起着重要的作用。领导和同志的帮助，对一个后进同志的转变有很大的影响。我们绝不能片面地强调内因的作用，推卸帮助后进同志的责任，放松对他们的帮助。当然，外因必须通过内因才能起作用。帮助后进同志，一定要突出政治，抓活思想，启发后进同志开展兴无灭资的思想斗争，提高思想觉悟。政治指导员，是连队政治思想战线上的指挥员。我们的战场，就在战士的头脑里边。我们的任务就是帮助战士打好兴无灭资的思想仗。我们的工作做得越是有力，越是做到点子上去，后进同志的思想仗就会打得越好，进步越快。如果我们工作不主动，方法不对头，就会影响他们打好思想仗。
    帮助后进同志打思想仗，要抓住根本，抓住世界观的改造。也就是要做好毛泽东思想的灌输工作，千方百计地、一点一滴地把毛泽东思想灌输到后进同志的头脑中去。要针对后进同志的主要问题，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，学了就鼓励，用了就表扬，用好了就帮助他们总结。引导他们联系实际，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想不断地去批判非无产阶级思想。这样，毛泽东思想就能够在他们头脑里一步一步地占领阵地，扎下根子，由后进转变为先进。四班有个战士，缺点比较多。开始学习毛主席著作，不注意接触思想，说是说，做是做，比如口头上说是一分为二，实际上对自己只看优点，对别人只看缺点，在班里团结搞不好。有一次，我碰到他正在学习关于一分为二的文章，我问他：“学得怎么样？”他说：“毛主席讲的这个道理好懂，我给你讲讲吧！”我说：“这样吧，你用一分为二的观点把自己的思想好好分析分析，明天讲给我听听。”他听了很高兴，回去以后，把所有的优点都抖搂出来，写在纸上了。正准备找我谈，可一琢磨，觉得不对头，他想：指导员叫我谈一分为二，我光找自己的优点，这不是一点论吗！他通过思想“打架”，把自己的优缺点作了个全面分析。我听了，表扬他说：“学得不错，用上了！”他很高兴。后来，他进一步用一分为二的观点，找出了全班每个同志的优点，并对照自己找了八条差距，在实际工作中一条一条地去克服，思想有了很大进步。他深有体会地说：“学习一分为二，要学会分，更要学会斗。会分，才能看清自己头脑里的先进思想和落后思想；会斗，才能用毛泽东思想克服自己的落后思想，不断前进。”
    帮助后进同志打好思想仗，还要考虑他们每个人的特点。有的问题多，有的问题少；有的接受问题慢，有的接受问题快。因此，要具体分析，区别对待，不能采取一刀切、一锅煮的办法。如果不加区别，高粱大米一锅煮，就会有的生，有的熟，效果不好。
    做好后进同志的工作，还要充分注意依靠骨干，发动群众，把连队变成一个红色的熔炉，给后进同志的转变创造一个良好的环境。也就是说，要把连队学习毛主席著作的风气搞得很盛，政治空气搞得很浓，原则性搞得很强，一个人有问题大家都关心，一个人有缺点大家都帮助，到处都是温暖的手。后进同志在这样一个红色的熔炉里，就会被冶炼成为坚强的红色接班人。如果不充分依靠骨干，发动群众，人人做思想工作，那么，对后进同志的教育工作就会没有力量。这样，就不利于后进同志向先进方向转化。
    后进变先进是一个反复的斗争过程
    后进转化为先进，不是一件简单的事情。常常要经过一个长期的、艰苦的思想斗争过程。
    要树立无产阶级思想，就要克服非无产阶级思想，要养成艰苦奋斗的作风，就要克服懒懒散散的作风，要树立唯物辩证法的观点，就要克服形而上学的观点。后进同志身上的旧思想、旧习惯，虽然不是主流，但都不是一天两天形成的。有一些毛病形成的时间比较长，根子比较深。要破除这些旧思想、旧习惯，树立起新思想、新习惯，是一个很艰巨的任务。譬如行军这样一件小事，有的同志原来在家里，走二里地都要坐电车，突然要求他们在一个晚上行军一百里，就必然会有一番艰苦的思想斗争。个别同志吃不住劲了，叫一点苦，掉一点队，并没有什么奇怪的。他们只有不断地同困难作斗争，经过实际的锻炼，才能树立起不怕苦、不怕累的思想。过去，我们对后进转变为先进的长期性、艰巨性认识不足，对他们恨铁不成钢，工作上急于求成，要求他们很快就把毛病通通改掉，就象个急性子的炊事员一样，只管往灶里加火，不管锅里饭受得了受不了，结果，好心没有办了好事，把后进同志抓得越来越泄气。
    后进向先进转化，是一个从量变到质变的过程，只有到了一定的程度，才能够突飞猛进，出现一个飞跃。在刚开始转变的时候，他们认识问题，不会象先进同志那样清楚，处理问题，也不会象先进同志那么正确。常常会出现思想和行动脱节的现象。有的同志行动上跟着做了，但是思想认识还不那么自觉；也有的同志，认识上有了提高，但行动上没有马上跟上去。我们感到，后进同志的这种转变，虽然还很不明显，但它是进步的红色信号，成长的先进幼苗。我们一定要抓住这些苗头，作为帮助他们转变的突破口，耐心细致地进行工作，满腔热情促进他们的进步。他们有了好的行动，虽然认识还不够，也不能说他们是“动机不纯”，应该帮助他们在行动的基础上提高认识；他们有了一定的认识，虽然行动还没有跟上，也不能说他们“言行不一”，应该引导他们把正确的思想落实到行动中去，一步一步地促进他们向先进方面转化。要不然，就不能及时有力地帮助他们进步。
    后进同志在进步的过程中，一般都会出现反复，情绪时高时低，时起时落，这是一种正常的情况。不经过几个反复，就不能完全解决新旧思想和新旧习惯谁战胜谁的问题，就不能使毛泽东思想真正扎下根来。我们一定要承认反复，认识反复，研究反复的原因，掌握人的思想变化的规律，才可能尽量减少反复。六班有个战士，由于过去沾染了社会上的一些旧习惯，经常吵嘴闹架。开始，他和班长争吵，我认为他年轻幼稚，个别谈了一下，他作了检讨，我觉得这个问题已经解决了。过了一段时间，他又和别人吵了一架，连操课都不想参加，我又对他进行了教育，他表示要坚决改正自己的缺点。谁知，没有多久，他和另一个同志又闹翻了，气得饭都不吃，没请假就上街买饼干。这个战士的毛病为什么这样一而再、再而三地犯呢？经过仔细的分析研究，原因终于弄清楚了。一方面，他的旧毛病没有得到彻底改造，有一种顽固的习惯势力；另一方面，他又有上进的要求，犯了毛病后又很后悔，这样在他思想上就有两股劲，象拔河一样，你拉过去，我拉过来，进行着激烈的斗争，形成出了毛病就检讨，检讨了又出毛病，出了毛病再检讨这样一个反反复复的现象。以后，我就针对他的这个特点，帮助他活学活用毛主席著作，不间断地进行思想工作，从根本上提高他的阶级觉悟。同时要大家给他创造进步的条件，不给他造成犯毛病的条件。通过较长时期的帮助，这个同志的缺点逐渐得到了克服。
    实际工作使我们认识到，战士的思想变化是很复杂的，我们的认识和工作都不能简单化。做后进同志的工作要有抓住不放，一抓到底的精神，要打“持久战”，不能一劳永逸。开始，要鼓励他们敢于同自己的旧思想“拼刺刀”，当他们取得一些胜利的时候，要鼓励他们连续作战；当先进思想占优势的时候，要鼓励他们不要松气；当消极因素占上风的时候，要给他们吹“热风”，教育他们不要悲观泄气。在任何情况下，对后进同志都要一分为二，既不能因为他们一时有了进步，就认为差不多了；也不能因为他们暂时出现了曲折，就丧失信心，要坚持不懈地引导他们自觉地进行思想革命。对先进也要一分为二，促进先进更先进
    先进和后进是对立的统一，是可以互相转化的。后进可以变先进，先进可以变得更先进，也可以变后进。先进和后进是相对的，我们也必须用一分为二的观点来看待先进的同志，促进先进更先进，防止先进变后进。过去，我们看待先进的同志，有过两种片面性。一种是认为他们好到顶了，不注意抓薄弱环节。再一种就是不相信他们真先进，抓住一点缺点，否定了他们的先进性。为什么会犯这种毛病呢？最主要的就是缺乏一分为二的观点。
    先进同志的优点更多一些，思想觉悟比较高一些。但是，他们也有非无产阶级思想，也有薄弱环节，而且容易产生骄傲情绪，放松思想改造，保虚荣，丢根本。我们对他们一定要一分为二，不能偏爱他们，姑息迁就他们。要教育他们对自己也要一分为二，树立起不断革命的思想。要抱着认真负责的态度，严格要求，帮助他们克服薄弱环节，特别是对他们的毛主席著作学习，不仅不能放松，而且要求他们要抓得更紧，学得更多，理解得更深，用得更好。在抓薄弱环节的时候，要抓住那些带根本性质的问题。不要在一些生活细节上打转转，弄得他们谨小慎微，不能把注意力集中到克服主要的缺点上去。
    在实际工作中，我们还犯过另一种片面性，对先进战士，要求他们十全十美。对他们的缺点大惊小怪，特别是对由后进变为先进的同志，常常抓住他们的一点缺点就否定全盘。结果，挫伤了这些同志的积极性。我们连有个刘国良同志，刚到连队的时候，是个有名的“娇气兵”，后来认真活学活用毛主席著作，思想面貌发生了很大变化，跨进了先进战士的行列。他的优点虽然比较突出，但是也还有一些缺点，个别同志抓住了这些缺点，就乱吹“冷风”。有一次，他到连部没有报告就闯进去了，一看屋里有首长又退了回来，有的同志就说：“你看，还不是老样子！”弄得他工作情绪一度下降。后来，我们对这些同志进行了教育，使他们认识到：刘国良的缺点，同他的优点比较起来，是一个指头和九个指头的问题，绝不能因为他有些缺点，就抵消了他主要的、先进的一面。对先进战士严格要求是对的，但是严要严得实际，严得合理，不要超过限度。对他们的缺点，要具体分析，不要把枝节问题当做原则问题，把偶然性的问题当做一贯性的问题，把实际问题当做思想问题，这样，才会真正有利于调动他们的积极因素，克服他们的薄弱环节。
    要使先进更先进，除了抓他们的薄弱环节，还要大抓他们的先进因素，促进先进因素继续发展，更加突出。先进因素突出了，毛泽东思想红旗举得更高了，克服消极因素的自觉性就更强了，力量就更大了。有了无产阶级思想这面镜子，非无产阶级思想就看得更清了；有了唯物辩证法这把尺子，形而上学的思想就看得更准了。不注意抓先进因素，单纯的抓缺点，就容易把先进战士抓得迷迷糊糊，弄得他们方向不明，缩手缩脚，他们的优点就难以得到充分发扬，就难以有所创造，有所前进。我们连有一个先进同志，去年初总结了运用毛泽东思想指导军事训练的经验，到兄弟连队介绍，很受欢迎。有些同志出于好心，认为对先进就是要狠抓缺点，没有注意发扬他努力学习、敢于创造的精神，相反的，对他生活上的一些缺点，批评、指责过多。结果，使这个同志抓了小的，丢了大的，只顾了改正生活上的一些缺点，好的一面没有充分得到发扬，一度停顿了下来。我们接受这个教训，认识到对先进同志既要帮助他们克服缺点，也要帮助他们发扬优点；同时也注意教育先进的同志在克服薄弱环节的同时，要大力发扬先进因素，发扬革命的闯劲，争取先进更先进。这样，就掀起了一个比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进的热潮。学习毛主席著作的空气更浓厚了，积极的因素更加发扬了。
    我感到，用唯物辩证法做好后进变先进、先进更先进的转化工作，是一个不断学习、不断实践、不断提高的过程。在这方面，我做得还很不够。今后决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，加强自己的思想革命化，尽量使自己脑子里的辩证法多一些，形而上学少一些，把战士的思想转化工作做得更好一些。
