    Advocate for Better Integration of Doctors and Nurses
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    Should doctors do some of the work of nurses? Is it better for medical treatment and nursing to be strictly separated or appropriately combined? The experiences of hospitals under the jurisdiction of Chongqing and the First Hospital of Shenyang have provided an affirmative answer.

    Throughout the entire treatment process, medical treatment and nursing are two closely linked and inseparable aspects. Doctors and nurses are closely related comrades-in-arms, jointly responsible for patients and fighting diseases side-by-side. In our hospitals, doctors and nurses only have different specialties, different divisions of labor, and different tasks; there is no distinction between high and low, noble and lowly. When needed, doctors can do the work of nurses, giving injections and administering medicine to patients; during wartime, they can carry stretchers to transport the wounded and sick. Under the guidance of doctors, nurses can also do some treatment work. The great internationalist fighter Norman Bethune once took care of the excrement and urine of wounded soldiers, and personally made splints for them. He believed that a good surgeon should not only have superb medical skills, but also be a carpenter, tailor, blacksmith, and barber; whatever the wounded and sick need, he should be able to do it, all to alleviate the suffering of the wounded and sick and to help them recover their health as soon as possible. Norman Bethune's revolutionary spirit and practice are models for the vast majority of medical workers to learn from.

    From the perspective of urban hospitals, implementing the integration of medical care and nursing, with doctors doing some nursing work and nurses doing some treatment work within their capabilities, is conducive to gradually overcoming the bourgeois hierarchical concepts among medical personnel, gradually removing the shackles of old frameworks and foreign dogmas, promoting the ideological transformation of medical personnel, and establishing a proletarian worldview. At the same time, it is also conducive to freeing up more medical personnel to go to the countryside to serve the peasants.

    Going to the countryside to prevent and treat diseases for the peasants requires even more the implementation of the integration of medical care and nursing. When going to the countryside, it is impossible to move the entire hospital staff down, nor is it possible to move the entire set of hospital equipment down. Only medical teams can be formed, taking a small amount of medical equipment down to work in rural conditions. At the same time, when farmers see a doctor, they often require the doctor to be able to treat both internal medicine and surgery, give injections, and write prescriptions. This requires medical personnel to have the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, starting from the patient's perspective in everything, not caring about personal gains and losses, and striving to be "proficient in one specialty and capable in many."

    Of course, overcoming the hierarchical concepts between doctors and nurses, and advocating the integration of medical care and nursing and being proficient in one specialty and capable in many, does not mean that doctors and nurses should not have a division of labor, or that they should not have a specialty. What we advocate is, on the premise of being beneficial to the patient, implementing appropriate integration, mastering more skills to serve the patient, and serving the patient better.

    提倡医生护士更好地结合
    本报评论员
    医生应不应当做些护士的工作？医疗和护理是截然分开好还是适当结合好？重庆市属各医院和沈阳市第一医院的经验，作了肯定的回答。
    在整个医治过程中，医疗和护理是紧紧相连的、不可分割的两个环节，医生和护士是密切相关的战友，共同对病人负责，并肩对疾病作战。在我们的医院里，医生和护士，只是专业不同、分工不同、任务不同，没有高低贵贱之分。在需要的时候，医生可以做护士的工作，为病人打针、喂药；在战争年代，可以抬担架运送伤病员。护士在医生的指导下，也可以做一些治疗工作。伟大的国际主义战士白求恩，就曾经为伤病员端屎端尿，亲自动手为伤员做支架。他认为一个好的外科医生不仅要有精湛的医疗技术，而且还要会做木匠、缝纫匠、铁匠、理发匠；伤病员需要做什么就要会做什么，一切为了减轻伤病员的痛苦，一切为了使伤病员早日恢复健康。白求恩的革命精神和实践，是广大医务人员学习的榜样。
    从城市医院来说，实行医护结合，医生做一些护士工作，护士做一些力所能及的治疗工作，有利于逐步克服医务人员中的资产阶级等级观念，逐步解除旧框框、洋教条的束缚，促进医务人员的思想改造，树立无产阶级世界观。同时，也有利于抽出更多的医务人员，到农村去为农民服务。
    到农村去为农民防病治病，更必须实行医护结合。到农村去，不可能把医院全班人马都搬下去，也不可能把医院的全套设备都搬下去，只能组成医疗队，带少量的医疗设备下去，在农村条件下进行工作。同时，农民看病，往往要求医生既会看内科，又会看外科，既会打针，又会处方。这就要求医务人员有全心全意为人民服务的精神，一切从病人出发，不计较个人的得失，作到“一专多能”。
    当然，克服医生和护士之间的等级观念，提倡医护结合、一专多能，决不是说医生和护士就不要有分工，就不应当有专业。我们提倡的是在有利于病人的前提下，实行适当的结合，掌握更多的为病人服务的本领，更好地为病人服务。
