　　“增”字背后有文章
　　Increase production, is a good thing; increasing production year after year is even better. However, some county committee comrades have deviated in their thinking precisely on the "increase" character of increasing production, contenting themselves with: "It's good to increase a little each year, whether it's a lot or a little," "Increasing production is not much, but it's stable and reliable"... Therefore, they are complacent, satisfied with the status quo, and unwilling to continue to move forward by leaps and bounds.
　　Materialist dialectics tells us that everything in the world is constantly developing and changing, and there are no things that are ever static and unchanging. We must also view increasing production with a developmental perspective. If we are satisfied with increasing production without continuing to lead the masses forward by leaps and bounds, we may turn increasing production into protecting production. If we regard each increase in production as a new starting point and continue to create conditions, we can continuously increase production.
　　Meng County in Shanxi is an example. During the five years from 1958 to 1962, the average annual increase here was 2.62 percent compared to 1957. They were not satisfied with this increase, but were determined to "be like Dazhai people, establish Dazhai ambition, and follow the Dazhai road." In 1964, production increased by 19.56 percent compared to 1963, and there was another large increase in production last year despite the severe drought. It can be seen that although both are increases in production, the magnitude and speed are very different.
　　Being satisfied with increasing production is a one-sided way of looking at the problem, only seeing that the total output has increased, without seeing the imbalance in output per unit area, only seeing the advanced measures, without seeing the weak links. In fact, no matter how large the increase in production is in a county, a commune, or a team, there are still low-yielding units and low-yielding plots of land; no matter how advanced the production measures are, there are still weak links. Only by finding and overcoming the weak links can we continue to move forward.
　　Being satisfied with increasing production is an isolated way of looking at the problem. Only seeing oneself, not seeing others, only knowing that one's own sky is high, not knowing that there are skies beyond the sky. Only by humbly learning from advanced regions can we reach a higher level.
　　Being satisfied with increasing production is a static way of looking at the problem, only seeing the current situation, not seeing the development, only knowing that production has increased under existing conditions, not knowing that once conditions change, production will increase even faster and greater. As long as we look at problems from a developmental point of view, actively utilize favorable conditions, overcome unfavorable conditions, and create new conditions, we will see a higher level of increased production.
　　Chairman Mao teaches us: In the three great revolutionary movements, we must constantly sum up experience, and "make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress." Comrades who are satisfied with increasing production unconsciously violate Chairman Mao's teachings and commit metaphysical errors.
　　Using a metaphysical viewpoint to view existing increases in production will lead to the loss of revolutionary spirit, and it will be impossible to stride forward in accordance with the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. To lead socialist large-scale agriculture well, we must greatly destroy metaphysics and greatly establish dialectics, and make greater contributions to building a new socialist countryside.

　　“增”字背后有文章
    增产，是好事；年年增产，更是好事。可是，有些县委同志，恰恰在增产的“增”字上思想离了辙儿，满足于：“增多增少，年年增点就好”、“增产不多，稳当牢靠”……因而，沾沾自喜，安于现状，不愿继续大步前进了。
    唯物辩证法告诉我们，世界上的一切事物都在不断发展变化，永远静止不变的事物是不存在的。增产，也要用发展的眼光来看。如果满足于增产，而不继续领导群众大步前进，就可能使增产变成保产。如果把每次增产看成是新的起点，继续创造条件，就可以不断增产。
    山西盂县就是一例。从一九五八年到一九六二年的五年间，这里每年平均比一九五七年增产百分之二点六二。他们没有满足于这个增产幅度，而是决心“做大寨人，立大寨志，走大寨之路”，一九六四年又比一九六三年增产百分之一九点五六，去年大旱又大增产。可见，同样是增产，幅度和速度，大不相同。
    满足于增产，是片面的看问题，只看到总产量增加了，没看到单位面积产量不平衡，只看到先进措施，没看到还有薄弱环节。事实上，一个县、一个社、一个队，增产幅度再大，也还有低产单位和低产田块；增产措施再先进，也还有薄弱环节。只有找出和克服薄弱环节，才可以不断前进。
    满足于增产，是孤立地看问题。只看见自己，没看见别人，只知道自己的天高，不知道天外还有天。只有虚心向先进地区学习，才会更上一层楼。
    满足于增产，是静止地看问题，只看到现状，没看到发展，只知道在现有条件下增产了，不知道一旦条件变了，增产会更快更大。只要用发展的观点看问题，积极利用有利条件，克服不利条件，创造新的条件，就会出现更高的增产水平。
    毛主席教导我们：在三大革命运动中要不断地总结经验，要“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。满足于增产的同志，自觉不自觉地违背了毛主席的教导，犯了形而上学的毛病。
    用形而上学观点看待已有的增产幅度，就会丧失革命精神，就不可能按照多快好省建设社会主义的总路线精神阔步前进。要领导好社会主义的大农业，必须大破形而上学、大立辩证法，为建设社会主义新农村做出更大的贡献。
