    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 16th – The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published a commentary on January 16th regarding Johnson's State of the Union address, stating that Johnson indicated his intention to continue fighting in Vietnam and to remain in Vietnam. This self-confession by Johnson reveals the essence of the US government and its "peace offensive" policy.

    The commentary stated that, bluntly put, Johnson's prescription for resolving the Vietnam issue aims to perpetuate the imperialist occupation and legitimize their barbaric aggression. Only the friends of imperialism and the revisionists, the enemies of the Vietnamese people, would accept and peddle it. The commentary pointed out that Johnson talks of "peace" while simultaneously conducting a full-scale war of aggression and preparing to further expand aggression against the people of various countries. Johnson speaks of "peace" but engages in war, a barbaric aggression against the people of Vietnam, the people of Santo Domingo, and other people. Johnson's words are completely self-contradictory, as incompatible as water and fire. Therefore, the people of various countries will not believe him and will not be fooled by him.

    The commentary stated that the "scorched earth" policy and the "Three Alls" policy implemented by the US aggressors in Vietnam, and the deaths of thousands of Vietnamese children, women, and elderly due to US bombings and poison gas, expose Johnson's true face. He is the greatest criminal and the greatest demagogue of our time.

    *Unity* also published a commentary on the same day, stating that Johnson's State of the Union address, from beginning to end, is permeated with an atmosphere of war and aggression, and that the US aggression against Vietnam towers above all else. The Johnson administration's trickery of "peace talks" and "suspension of bombing" is an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and submit to the "conditions" of US imperialism. This cunning trick of US imperialism has surprisingly received "understanding and support" from Khrushchev revisionists and certain countries. Khrushchev revisionists are going to any lengths to save US imperialism from failure. Shelepin's visit to Hanoi served this purpose, as did Kosygin's meeting with US Vice President Humphrey and Secretary of State Rusk in Delhi on January 13th. They are openly running around for the "Vietnam conflict" and are plotting new plans against the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle.

    The commentary stated, however, that no matter how the imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists plot to betray the Vietnamese people, they will never succeed.

    *Warrior* also published a commentary stating that Johnson's State of the Union address is nothing more than a culmination of the US imperialist policy of aggression and "peace" demagoguery. The revolutionary people of all countries are very clear that Johnson will never lay down the butcher's knife. They will further strengthen the struggle against aggression, heighten their vigilance, and fight to smash all the conspiracy plans of US imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism.

    *Voice of Youth* published a commentary on the 12th, pointing out that Johnson's "peace offensive" and Shelepin's visit to Hanoi are coordinated moves in a joint US-Soviet action.

    The commentary stated that Johnson's "peace offensive" is a completely premeditated and meticulously planned conspiracy, a reflection of the old US imperialist plan to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, transform South Vietnam into an American colony, and remain in South Vietnam.

    The commentary pointed out that the Johnson government is going to any lengths to realize its conspiracy, but mainly relies on US-Soviet cooperation. Secret meetings are frequently held between the Soviet revisionist leaders and Johnson's special envoys, and there is frequent telegraphic communication between Wilson and Kosygin. The US imperialists are particularly interested in the visit of the Soviet delegation headed by Shelepin to Hanoi, which is also completely understandable.

    The commentary then pointed out that the news of Shelepin's visit to Hanoi was published the day before the Johnson administration launched its "peace offensive," which is by no means a coincidence, but rather a coordination of joint US-Soviet action. It is very clear that Shelepin's visit to Hanoi was not to oppose US imperialism, but to serve US imperialism. The US imperialists declared that during Shelepin's stay in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they would suspend bombing of that country.

    The commentary exposed the US imperialists' "Fourteen Points" proposal, saying that its essence is fundamentally not "based" on the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords have long been trampled on and torn up by the Johnson government. It is a trap set for the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, letting them accept "negotiations" "based" on the long-term occupation of South Vietnam by US troops. In a word, it is to achieve what cannot be achieved on the battlefield and to make the Vietnamese people surrender unconditionally to the United States.

    阿报说约翰逊国情咨文自我揭穿了“和平攻势”的侵略实质
    苏修策划出卖越南人民阴谋永远不能得逞
    新华社地拉那十六日电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十六日就约翰逊的国情咨文发表评论说，约翰逊表示要在越南打下去，要赖在越南。约翰逊的这种自我表白道出了美国政府及其“和平攻势”政策的实质。
    评论说，拆穿了说，约翰逊解决越南问题的处方目的在于使帝国主义的占领永久化，使他们的野蛮侵略合法化，只有帝国主义的朋友和越南人民的敌人修正主义者才会接受和加以兜售。评论指出，约翰逊口头上谈“和平”，同时，进行全面的侵略战争并准备更加扩大对各国人民的侵略。约翰逊说的是“和平”，但干的是战争，是对越南人民、圣多明各人民和其他人民的野蛮侵略，约翰逊的话完全是自相矛盾的，就象水与火一样不能彼此相容，因此各国人民不会相信他，不会上他的当。
    评论说，美国侵略者在越南实行的“焦土”政策、“三光”政策和成千上万的越南儿童、妇女、老人死于美国轰炸和毒气之下，这暴露了约翰逊的真正嘴脸，他是当代最大的罪犯和最大的蛊惑家。
    《团结报》在同一天也发表评论说，约翰逊提出的国情咨文从头到尾浸透着战争和侵略的气氛，而凌驾于一切之上的是美国对越南的侵略。约翰逊政府玩弄“和谈”和“暂停轰炸”的鬼把戏，是企图迫使越南人民放下武器，屈从于美帝国主义的“条件”。美帝国主义的这种狡猾伎俩竟然得到了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和某些国家的“谅解和支持”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了把美帝国主义从失败中挽救出来而无所不用其极。谢列平访问河内是为这一目的服务，柯西金一月十三日在德里与美国副总统汉弗莱、国务卿腊斯克的会谈也是为这一目的服务的。他们彼此为“越南冲突”公开奔走，正在策划反对越南人民解放斗争的新计划。
    评论说，但是，不管帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者如何策划阴谋出卖越南人民，他们永远也不会得逞。
    《战士报》也发表评论说，约翰逊的国情咨文不过是集美帝国主义侵略政策和“和平”蛊惑宣传的大成而已。各国革命人民很清楚，约翰逊决不会放下屠刀，他们将进一步加强反对侵略的斗争，提高警惕，为粉碎美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的所有阴谋计划而斗争。
    《青年之声报》十二日发表评论指出，约翰逊的“和平攻势”和谢列平访问河内是苏美联合行动的互相配合。
    评论说，约翰逊的“和平攻势”完全是预谋的和精心策划的阴谋计划，是美帝国主义企图使越南人民投降，变越南南方为美国的殖民地，并赖在越南南方不走的陈旧计划的回光返照。
    评论指出，约翰逊政府为了实现自己的阴谋而无所不用其极，但主要是依靠苏美合作。苏联修正主义领导和约翰逊的特使之间经常举行秘密会晤，在威尔逊和柯西金之间常有电报往来。美帝国主义对以谢列平为首的苏联代表团访问河内特别感到兴趣，也是完全可以理解的。
    评论接着指出，谢列平访问河内的消息是在约翰逊政府发动“和平攻势”前一天发表的，这绝不是偶然的巧合，而是苏美联合行动的相互配合。十分清楚，谢列平访问河内不是为了反对美帝国主义，而是为了替美帝国主义效劳。美帝国主义宣称，在谢列平逗留越南民主共和国期间，将停止对这个国家的轰炸。
    评论揭露美帝国主义的“十四点”主张说，它的实质根本不是以日内瓦协议为“基础”。日内瓦协议早就被约翰逊政府蹂躏和撕毁了。它是给越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线设下圈套，让他们接受以美国军队长期占领越南南方为“基础”的“谈判”。一句话，它是为了实现在战场上得不到的东西，使越南人民向美国无条件投降。
