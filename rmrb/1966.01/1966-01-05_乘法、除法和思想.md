    Multiplication, Division, and Thought
    A Soldier from a PLA Unit Liu Shuchen
    In a certain PLA unit, a political instructor noticed that many soldiers left quite a few grains of rice on the table after eating. He thought: Hard work and thrift are not minor issues; they must be started from the smallest things, and more importantly, the understanding must first be enhanced ideologically. Once, after a meal, he gathered all the comrades of the company in the canteen, inspected the various tables, and then spoke about the importance of saving, and the moving deeds of saving in the company's past, and guided everyone to do a calculation: "Our country is a country with more than 600 million people. If we multiply the grains of rice we waste by 600 million, what a large number that would be? What about one meal like this? What about one day, one month, one year?..." After the instructor calculated this way, the comrades felt that it was indeed no small matter. Because ideological importance was attached to it, it was rare to see rice grains dropped on the table from then on.
    Regarding the same matter, different ideological understandings lead to different attitudes. Let’s take the example of dropping rice grains while eating. While the instructor used multiplication to calculate, some people used division. They said: "Don't talk about dropping a few grains of rice; even if it were several dou and sheng, with a national population of more than 600 million, each person wouldn't even get one grain. There's no need to make such a fuss and be so alarmed!..." Under the guidance of this "division" thinking, even if one shouts to pay attention to saving every day, the phenomenon of dropping rice grains while eating cannot be changed.
    In short, whether or not ideological importance is attached, and how to calculate the big account for a population of over 600 million, the attitudes of people toward saving a piece of coal, a kilowatt of electricity, a fen of money, an inch of cloth...are very different. Chairman Mao taught us: "We want to carry out large-scale construction, but our country is still a very poor country. This is a contradiction. Practicing thrift in a comprehensive and sustained way is a method to solve this contradiction." Let each of us keep Chairman Mao's words firmly in mind and do more multiplication and less division in our daily lives and work!

    乘法、除法和思想
    解放军某部战士  刘书忱
    解放军某部有一位指导员，发现一些战士吃饭后，桌子上留下不少饭粒。他想：艰苦奋斗、厉行节约不是个小问题，要从一点一滴做起，更要首先从思想上提高认识。一次吃过饭，他把全连同志集合在食堂，参观了各个饭桌，然后讲了节约的重要性，讲了本连过去节约的动人事迹，并引导大家算一笔账：“我国是一个有六亿多人口的国家，倘若把我们丢掉的饭粒用六亿乘一下，那将是个多大的数字呢？一餐这样，一天、一个月、一年呢？……”指导员这样一算，同志们觉得确实非同小可。由于思想上引起了足够重视，从此就很少见桌上掉饭粒了。
    对同一件事，思想认识不同，态度也就不同。还拿吃饭掉饭粒说吧。那位指导员用乘法算，有些人却用除法算。他们说：“不要说掉那么几颗饭粒，就是几斗几升，全国六亿多人，每个人也摊不上一颗，不必那样小题大作，大惊小怪！……”在这种“除法”思想的指导下，即使天天喊注意节约，吃饭掉饭粒的现象却改不了。
    总之，有没有从思想上引起重视，对六亿多人口的大账如何算法，人们对节约一块煤、一度电、一分钱、一寸布……的态度是大不相同的。毛主席教导说：“我们要进行大规模的建设，但是我国还是一个很穷的国家，这是一个矛盾。全面地持久地厉行节约，就是解决这个矛盾的一个方法。”让我们每个人都牢记毛主席的这段话，在日常生活和工作中多算乘法、少算除法吧！
