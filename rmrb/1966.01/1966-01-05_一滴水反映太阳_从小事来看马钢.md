	Cannot Yield

	One day, Zhao Wanmao, a railway worker from the Engineering Section of the Transportation Department of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel (Ma Gang), was leading two young track workers to overhaul a set of railway turnouts. After a long period of hard work, the three of them managed to bring the gauge of each component of the entire set of turnouts up to standard, except for the wing rail of the frog, which was still two millimeters short.

	"Master Zhao, what does it matter if it's only two millimeters short? Doesn't the specification allow for a tolerance of two millimeters undersize or six millimeters oversize?" Master Zhao chuckled and said, "Don't underestimate these two millimeters. If you don't care about being two millimeters short, and I don't care about being two millimeters short, and everyone makes allowances for these two millimeters, when will we ever achieve high standards?"

	Strict with Oneself

	Ji Miaogen, a lathe operator from the No. 1 Rolling Mill, felt very upset after he had turned a roll undersized. Someone tried to comfort him by saying, "Fortunately, it doesn't have to be scrapped; it's still usable." Ji Miaogen was not comforted by this. He thought: A lathe operator should consider any workpiece that does not meet the requirements of the drawing or the sample to be a reject. To find the cause of the defect, he squatted in front of his defective product, pondering it over and over. At this moment, he suddenly heard that another similar machine tool had also turned a roll undersized while processing the same type of roll. Later, it was discovered that the steel ruler was a little short.

	This steel ruler had been used for a long time, and one end was a bit bald. Someone had unknowingly sawed off twenty millimeters from the rusted end, and then forgot to tell anyone else. Some people thought that the problem was with the measuring tool and not Ji Miaogen's responsibility. However, Ji Miaogen did not excuse himself at all. Instead, he blamed himself for being mentally careless at work and not checking the steel ruler!

	Starting from Scratch

	On the morning of March 24, 1964, a new worker who had just been transferred to the No. 3 Factory Area Substation, due to carelessness during a pre-shift inspection, mistakenly operated the control switch of the main switch as a voltage conversion switch, causing a power outage to the entire No. 3 Factory Area for nearly a minute. At the accident analysis meeting, some people believed that it was enough to learn from the accident and that it should not affect the safety record. However, most people believed that although this accident did not cause any production losses, its nature was serious, and the cause of the accident was carelessness. Therefore, the original safety record had to be interrupted and started from scratch. Old worker Zhang Hongfu said, "We want a solid safety record; otherwise, we won't feel good about ourselves." After discussion, everyone decided to use March 25 as the first day of safe operation.

	To forever remember this lesson, they hung a sign on the stairwell with the slogan: "Firmly remember the lessons of the '3.24' accident and be a faultless electrician."

	A Chicken Feather

	The No. 35 Substation of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Power Plant is truly clean and bright, spotless, and every piece of equipment is as good as new, ensuring production safety. Not long ago, the production team leader, Chen Daibi, took over her shift and found a chicken feather at the door. She immediately said seriously, "This does not meet the handover regulations!" The comrade who was handing over the shift couldn't understand. She explained: "We must be strict in our work. Strictness improves our sense of responsibility, and strictness ensures safe production. Don't think a chicken feather is a small matter; if it falls on the two-phase high-voltage busbar, it will cause a major accident!"

	From then on, the eight female workers in this substation were determined to remove even a small bug or a few spider webs. They worked more carefully, and their shift handovers were more thorough.

### 一滴水反映太阳  从小事来看马钢

    一滴水反映太阳  从小事来看马钢
      不能迁就
    一天，马钢运输部工务段铁路工人赵万茂带着两个青年路工改一组铁路道岔。三个人忙了一大阵，将全组道岔各部件的轨距都改得合格了，唯独辙岔的翼轨处还小两个毫米。
      “赵师傅，只小两毫米有什么关系，规范不是允许小两毫米、大六毫米吗？”赵师傅却笑嘻嘻地说：“别小看这两毫米，假若你差两毫米不在乎，我差两毫米无所谓，大家都迁就这两毫米，我们到啥时候才能达到高标准呢？”
      严以责己
    第一轧钢厂车工纪妙根把车辊车小了，心里很难受。有人安慰他说：“好在不用报废，还可以。”纪妙根听了，并不感到宽慰，他想：一个车工，加工的工件不能符合图纸和样板的要求，都应该看成废品。为了寻找产生废品的原因，他蹲在自己的次品前，翻来复去思忖。这时，忽听说另一台同型机床在加工同一种轧辊时，也车小了。后来才发觉钢尺短了一点。
    这根钢尺使用久了，一头有些秃，不知那位同志把锈的一头锯去二十毫米，事后又忘了告诉别人。有人认为，毛病出在量具上，不是纪妙根的责任。纪妙根却毫不原谅自己，反而责备自己为什么工作时思想上麻痹大意，不检查一下钢尺呢！
      从头开始
    一九六四年三月二十四日早晨，一个刚调到三厂区总降压变电所的新工人在班前检查时，由于疏忽大意，误将总开关的控制开关当作电压转换开关操作，造成三厂区全部断电近一分钟的事故。在事故分析会上，有人认为：只要吸取事故教训就行了，不要影响安全纪录。但是，大多数人认为这次事故虽然没有造成生产损失，但性质是严重的，而且事故发生的原因是疏忽大意，因此必须把原有的安全纪录中断，从头开始。老工人张洪福说：“我们要的是过得硬的安全纪录，否则自己看了也不舒服。”经过讨论，大家决定以三月二十五日作为安全运行的第一天。
    为了永远记住这个教训，他们在楼梯口挂上牢记“三·二四”事故教训，作不出事故的配电工的标语牌。
      一根鸡毛
    马钢动力厂的三十五号变电所，真是地净窗明，一尘不染，样样设备都象新的一样，保证着生产安全。前不久的一天，生产组长陈黛碧接班，发现门口有一根鸡毛，马上就严肃地说：“这不符合交班规定！”交班的同志想不通，她便解释说：我们对待工作就得严格要求，严才能提高责任心，严才能保证安全生产。你别看一根鸡毛事小，万一它落到两相高压母线上，就会造成重大事故呀！”
    从那以后，这个所的八个女工，哪怕看到一只小虫、几根蜘蛛丝，也要坚决除掉，工作更细心，交班也更认真了。
