    US-Chiang Collusion Turns Taiwan into a Base for Aggression Against Vietnam
    Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army Protests the Adventurous Step of U.S. Imperialism in Expanding the War
    Xinhua News Agency, January 14th – U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are intensifying their military collusion, conspiring to turn Taiwan into an important military base for the U.S. to carry out its war of aggression against Vietnam.
    According to a special dispatch from Taiwan in the *New York Times* on January 12, the United States is expanding the air base in Taiwan, which will "play a major role" in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    It also said that the 314th Troop Carrier Wing of the U.S. Air Force, the three C-130 "Hercules" squadrons of the 6217th Support Group, six support squadrons, two command units, and other various support troops, are about to be stationed at the Kungkuan Air Base in central Taiwan. More than 780 officers and soldiers of the U.S. 6217th Support Group have already arrived in Taiwan.
    An Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on January 12 also said that if the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam further expands, Taiwan could replace Okinawa as a U.S. military operations base and serve as a gathering and transshipment point for the U.S. military.
    Taiwanese newspapers and Western news agencies have also revealed that the United States is planning to send its B-52 strategic bombers stationed in Guam to Taiwan to shorten the round trip distance when bombing Vietnam.
      While planning to take the above-mentioned military measures, a large number of U.S. military and political figures have continuously come to Taiwan to carry out conspiracies.
    On January 1, U.S. Vice President Humphrey went to Taiwan to hold talks with Chiang Kai-shek. Messages from Western news agencies in Taipei stated that they discussed the "cooperation" between the U.S. and Chiang in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Prior to this, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler also went to Taiwan to hold talks with Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang's military chiefs on the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and the "strengthening of cooperation" between the U.S. and Chiang.
    A few days ago, U.S. Pacific Air Forces Commander Harris led a group to carry out conspiratorial activities at some air bases in Taiwan.
    In addition, those who have recently been active in Taiwan also include the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, the division commander of the 1st Marine Division, and others.
    Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in addition to already sending a so-called "military advisory group" to South Vietnam, recently handed over four landing craft to the Nguyen Cao Ky clique for use.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 13th – According to the Vietnam News Agency on January 13, the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army wrote to the International Commission for Vietnam, protesting that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its military collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the war of aggression against Vietnam, especially the U.S. attempt to send B-52 strategic bombers to Taiwan to shorten the flight distance for bombing South Vietnam.
    The letter pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek clique has provided the Saigon puppet regime with four landing craft, and the United States is building a base in Taiwan for U.S. C-130 transport aircraft to supply U.S. troops invading Vietnam.
    The letter demanded that U.S. imperialism immediately stop its military collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and abandon its conspiracy to turn Taiwan into a war base.

    美蒋勾结把台湾变为侵越基地
    越人民军代表团抗议美帝这一扩大战争的冒险步骤
    新华社十四日讯　美帝国主义和蒋匪帮正在加紧进行军事勾结，阴谋把台湾变成美国进行侵略越南战争的重要军事基地。
    据《纽约时报》一月十二日一则自台湾发出的专讯说，美国正在扩大台湾空军基地，这个基地将在侵略越南战争中“起主要作用”。
    它还说，美国空军第三一四部队运输机联队，第六二一七支援大队的三个C—130“大力士”式飞机中队，六个支援中队，两个指挥部队和其他各种支援部队，即将进驻台湾中部的公馆空军基地。美国第六二一七支援大队的官兵七百八十多人已经到了台湾。
    美联社台北十二日消息也说，如果美国在越南的侵略战争进一步扩大，台湾很可以替代冲绳作为美军的作战基地，充当美军的集结待运地点。
    台湾报纸和西方通讯社还透露，美国正在计划把它驻扎在关岛的B—52型战略轰炸机派到台湾，以便在轰炸越南时可以缩短往返航程。
      在策划采取上述军事措施的时候，大批美国军政头目不断来到台湾进行阴谋活动。
    一月一日，美国副总统汉弗莱到台湾同蒋介石举行了会谈。西方通讯社从台北发出的消息说，他们讨论了美蒋在侵略越南战争中的“合作”问题。
    在此以前，美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒，也到台湾同蒋介石和蒋军头目就美国侵略越南战争局势和美蒋“加强合作问题”举行了会谈。
    几天前，美国太平洋空军总司令哈里斯带领一帮人马，还到台湾一些空军基地进行阴谋活动。
    此外，最近到台湾活动的，还有美国海军陆战队司令、海军陆战队第一师师长等人。
    在美帝国主义指使下，蒋匪帮除已经派往南越一个所谓“军事顾问团”外，最近还把四艘登陆艇交给阮高其集团使用。
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南通讯社十三日报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团写信给越南国际委员会，抗议美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中加紧在军事上勾结蒋介石集团，特别是美国企图把B—52战略轰炸机派到台湾去以缩短轰炸越南南方的飞行距离。
    信件指出，蒋介石集团已向西贡伪政权提供了四艘登陆艇，美国正在台湾修建一个供美国C—130运输机使用的基地，以便为侵越美军提供补给。
    信件要求美帝国主义立即停止同蒋介石集团的军事勾结，取消它把台湾变为战争基地的阴谋。
