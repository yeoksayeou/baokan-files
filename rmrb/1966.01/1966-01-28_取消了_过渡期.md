    Eliminated the "Transition Period"
    In the past, whenever the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant's blast furnaces changed to producing a new type of iron, it required a transition period of several days, during which the blast furnaces would produce many products that users did not need. In the past, people always believed that this situation was unchangeable. Later, the workers of Blast Furnace No. 3 diligently did a lot of hard work. They collected technical operational data from thirty-four instances of changing product types, sorted out more than 1,800 data points from tens of thousands of original records, and conducted serious research and analysis, finally discovering the rules for changing product types. Since then, they have broken the long-standing convention of needing a transition period when changing product types, achieving the ability to produce whatever is needed whenever it is needed, more promptly meeting the needs of users.
    The reason why some backward states of production have not been changed for a long time is not that these states are unchangeable, but that people do not try to change them. The workers of Blast Furnace No. 3 "did a lot of hard work" and finally changed the state of needing a "transition period" when changing product types, which is proof. Revolution is about changing the status quo; if everything remains the same, what revolution are we talking about? Don't many of our enterprises also have similar so-called unchangeable "transition periods" in production? It is worth thinking about.

### 取消了“过渡期”

    取消了“过渡期”
    过去，石钢炼铁厂高炉每次改炼新品种的铁，中间都要经过几天的过渡期，在过渡期内高炉要生产出许多用户不需要的产品。过去人们一直认为这种状况是无法改变的。后来，三高炉的职工扎扎实实地做了许多笨工作。他们收集了三十四次改变品种的技术操作资料，从上万个原始记录中，整理出一千八百多个数据，进行了认真的研究分析，终于找到了改变品种的规律。从此，打破了多年来改变品种要有过渡期的常规，做到要什么时候炼，就什么时候炼，更及时地满足了用户的需要。
    生产上某些落后的现状所以长期不得改变，并不是这种现状不可改变，而是人们不去改变。三高炉的职工“做了许多笨工作”以后，终于改变了改炼新品种必须有“过渡期”的现状，就是证明。革命，就是要改变现状，如果总是一成不变的老样子，还谈得到什么革命呢？我们很多企业在生产上是不是也有类似的所谓不可改变的“过渡期”，值得想一想。
