    A New Starting Point
    ——We workers are not afraid of big tasks; no matter how big the task is, it cannot overwhelm the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought!
      Zhang Baifa, Captain of the Youth Shock Brigade of the Beijing Reinforced Concrete Prefabricated Component Factory

    The New Year has arrived. These days, our Youth Shock Brigade is particularly jubilant! When everyone saw the piles of steel saved from a year's hard work, and heard the joyful singing of the machines successfully renovated after countless days and nights, smiles of victory could not help but appear on their energetic faces. At this moment, it seemed that the eight characters "Self-Reliance, Hard Struggle" were becoming taller and brighter in our hearts!

    It all started at the end of 1964. At that time, the leadership had just issued the production tasks for 1965, and a new production upsurge was about to be launched throughout the city. Some leading members of the shock brigade thought this way at the time: Our country's economy has greatly improved, and since we are going to increase production, it wouldn't be a big deal to ask the state for a little something. So, they racked their brains and started calculating! They calculated and calculated, filling three whole sheets of paper, all of which said things about asking for money, things, and people, but they just missed the two major accounts of "skillful work" and "human factors"!

    At that time, I was participating in the First Session of the Third National People's Congress. When Premier Zhou said: "...Human beings must constantly sum up experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress..." my face burned, and I said to myself secretly: "Chairman Mao is talking about me, isn't he?" I couldn't sit still! During the meeting, I ran back to the team three times to convey Chairman Mao's instructions and my own feelings to everyone.

    Everyone discussed for more than ten nights in a row, and the atmosphere was really enthusiastic. Everyone said that the conditions in Daqing were very difficult, but the people of Daqing overcame the difficulties and made great achievements; what about the people of Dazhai? They relied on a carrying pole, two ropes, and a basket to overcome such a great natural disaster. When talking about these issues, some comrades excitedly said: "Daqing and Dazhai's self-reliance are genuine, we shout self-reliance every day, but it turns out we are reaching out!"

    When the discussion was at its hottest, it so happened that the higher authorities approved 21,000 yuan for us to buy three brand-new molding machines. Communist Party member Dong Shuyuan firmly said: "We should return the money. We must learn from the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai and not be seekers! What our working class wants is a revolutionary spirit of hard work!"

    Everyone's eyes lit up, and their energy was fully mobilized. This is a new starting point. A vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched rapidly like a galloping horse.

    The first step was that we decided to make the molding machines ourselves. But where to find the materials? Where to get the blueprints? Without materials, we looked for waste materials everywhere, and without blueprints, we looked at other people's machines, learning a little each time. With the strong help of brother factories, after a month and a half of hard work, we finally made three molding machines. Even Master Chen Deshui, who used to doubt this approach, was overjoyed in front of our machines, and he said: "Chairman Mao was right, 'Self-reliance and hard work,' it's better to do it yourself than to reach out, and it's better to rely on people than on money!"

    With the machines renovated, the work changed. Earlier, those thirty-meter-long bundles of fifteen steel bars had to be carried by four strong young men to the frame to be cut off, and one person had to lift two to three thousand catties a day, which was really tiring! Now the cutting is automatically fed, and as soon as you press the button, the steel bars run onto the frame to be cut off by themselves, which is really easy and pleasant! In the past, straightening and cutting steel bars required a young man with good eyesight to stand and work, standing on one leg like a golden rooster, having to step on it two hundred times a day, his eyes were sore, and the steel bars were cut unevenly. Now it is automatic cutting, and 48-year-old Master Tian Linzi sits down and does the work. When the members of our shock brigade pass by here, seeing him sitting upright, they feel both envious and happy, and they like to sit next to Master and jokingly say: "Hey, you are liberated!"

    The first year of the Third Five-Year Plan is a new starting point. Our workers have been looking forward to this year for a long time! We must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, put politics in the forefront, and greet 1966 with greater revolutionary vigor. We workers are not afraid of big tasks; no matter how big the task is, it cannot overwhelm the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    新的起点
    ——咱们工人就是不怕任务大；任务再大，也压不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级！
      北京市钢筋混凝土预制构件厂青年突击队队长　张百发
    过新年了。这些日子，我们青年突击队可格外欢腾了！当大伙儿看到那一年辛苦节省下来的大堆大堆钢材，听到那经过多少个白日黑夜革新成功的机器发出欢唱，一张张充满朝气的脸上，禁不住露出了胜利的微笑。此刻，仿佛感到，“自力更生，奋发图强”八个字，在我们的胸中越来越高大，越来越明亮了！
    话得从一九六四年年底说起。那时，领导上刚刚下达一九六五年生产任务，全市即将掀起一个新的生产高潮。当时突击队有些领导成员这么想：咱们国家的经济大大好转啦，既然要增产，向国家伸手要点儿，不算什么。于是，就挖空心思算开账啦！算呀算呀，一开就是满满三大张纸，上边说的尽是要钱要东西要人的事儿，可恰恰就把“巧干”和“人的因素”两大笔账给漏啦！
    这时，我正在参加第三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。当周总理讲到：“……人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进……”的时候，我的脸一下烧红了，我暗暗对自己说：“毛主席这是在说我吧？”我怎么也坐不住啦！会议期间，我三次跑回队里，向大伙儿传达了毛主席的指示和自己的感受。
    大家接连讨论了十多个晚上，情绪可真热烈。都说大庆的条件多困难，可大庆人是顶着困难干出了伟大的成绩；大寨人呢？就仗一条扁担、两根绳、一个筐，战胜了这么大的自然灾害。谈到这些问题时，有的同志激动地说：“大庆、大寨的自力更生才是正牌，咱们天天喊自力更生，原来是伸手牌！”
    讨论到最火热的时候，可巧，这时上级批下来二万一千元，让我们买三台崭新的成型机。共产党员董书元坚定地说：“应当把钱退回去。咱们要学习大寨的革命精神，不当伸手派！咱们工人阶级要的就是奋发图强的革命闯劲儿！”
    大伙儿的眼睛亮堂了，劲儿都鼓得足足的。这是一个新的起点。一场热气腾腾的技术革新技术革命运动，势如奔马地迅猛开展起来了。
    第一步，我们决定自己动手搞成型机。可是，材料到哪里去找？图纸向哪里去要？没有材料，就到处找废料，没有图纸，就去看别人的机器，看一次，学一点，在兄弟厂的大力帮助下，经过一个半月的奋战，终于搞成了三台成型机。就连过去怀疑这种搞法的陈德水老师傅，在我们的机器面前也心花怒放了，他说：“还是毛主席说得对，‘自己动手，丰衣足食’，伸手不如动手，靠钱不如靠人啊！”
    革新了机器，工作可就变样了。早先，那三十米长、十五根一捆的钢筋，得四个棒小伙子搬到架子上切断，一个人一天得抬二三千斤，可累得够呛！现在是切断自动上料，只要一按电钮，钢筋就自个儿跑上架子切断，真是轻松愉快！过去调直切断钢筋，得一个眼神好的年青人站着干活，象金鸡独立似的一只脚得老踩，一天踩二百多次，两只眼珠瞪得发酸，钢筋切得还长短不齐。现在是自动切料，四十八岁的老师傅田林子坐着就把活干了。我们突击队的队员谁走过这儿，看他端端正正地坐着，心里又羡慕又高兴，都爱挨着老师傅坐会儿，嘴里还逗乐说：“嗨，您可解放啦！”
    第三个五年计划的头一年，是一个新的起点。咱们工人早就盼望这一年啦！我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，突出政治，以更大的革命干劲迎接一九六六年。咱们工人就是不怕任务大；任务再大，也压不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级！
