    Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association issued a statement today. The full text is as follows:

    Statement by the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association

    According to a report by the Indonesian Antara News Agency on January 6, 1966: On December 24, 1965, a meeting was held with the participation of the Indonesian government, the Indonesian Journalists' Association, and Mr. Yusuf. The Central Council of the Indonesian Journalists' Association decided to have its International Department Director, Arifin Pei, assume all the work and obligations of Yusuf, the Acting Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association. The report also stated that "the handover of powers will take place as soon as possible."

    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association hereby declares the following:

    This measure taken by the newly reorganized Central Council of the Indonesian Journalists' Association in early November 1965 is a blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association. As is well known, both Mr. Chawado of Indonesia, who serves as the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, and Mr. Yusuf, who serves as the Acting Secretary-General, were unanimously agreed upon by the Secretariat. They are responsible to the Secretariat in their work. No journalists' organization of any country has the right to impose its views on the Secretariat. Therefore, the unilateral decision by the new leading members of the Indonesian Journalists' Association to replace Yusuf is completely illegal and has no binding force on the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association.

    In November 1965, when the Secretariat was still in Jakarta, it convened a meeting to carefully study the situation facing Yusuf and decided that Yusuf's powers would be collectively borne by the Secretariat, and the duties would be jointly performed. Mr. Yusuf agreed to this decision. This decision can only be changed after the Secretariat re-discusses the above issues and reaches an agreement. No unilateral action can change the collective resolution of the Secretariat. Therefore, the so-called "handover of powers" is illegal and has no binding force on the Secretariat.

    The Secretariat reiterates: The Afro-Asian Journalists' Association is an independent, mass international organization that is not subject to the interference of any national journalists' organization or the interference of any national government. The so-called talks between the Indonesian government, the Indonesian Journalists' Association, and Yusuf are irrelevant to the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, and even less can they issue orders to the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association.

    The Secretariat solemnly declares: It will resolutely uphold the principle of consensus, and resolutely uphold the "Jakarta Declaration" of April 1963 and the resolutions of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Conference and previous Secretariat meetings. The Secretariat firmly opposes and refuses to recognize the illegal dispatch of Arifin Pei by the new leaders of the Indonesian Journalists' Association to interfere in the internal affairs of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association.

    The Secretariat has already left Jakarta. Any interference in the affairs of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association by the new leaders of the Indonesian Journalists' Association in the future will be illegal and invalid, and it will be resolutely opposed and thoroughly exposed.

    亚非记协书记处发表声明
    坚决反对干预亚非记协事务
    印度尼西亚记协片面宣布撤换亚非记协代总书记完全非法
    新华社八日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天发表声明，全文如下：
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的声明
    据印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社一九六六年一月六日报道：在一九六五年十二月二十四日，曾召开了由印度尼西亚政府、印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会和优素福先生参加的会议。印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会中央理事会决定让它的国际部主任阿里芬·佩承担亚非新闻工作者协会代总书记优素福的全部工作和义务。这个报道还说，“移交职权将尽快进行”。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处就此声明如下：
    一九六五年十一月初改组的印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会中央理事会采取的这种措施，是对亚非新闻工作者协会内部事务的粗暴干涉。众所周知，印度尼西亚的查禾多先生担任亚非新闻工作者协会的总书记，优素福先生担任代总书记，都是经过书记处一致同意的。他们在工作中对书记处负责。任何一个国家的记者组织都无权把自己的意见强加给书记处。因此印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会的新领导成员单方面宣布撤换优素福的决定，是完全非法的，对亚非新闻工作者协会毫无约束力。
    一九六五年十一月，当书记处还在雅加达时，曾经召开过会议，对优素福面临的处境作了慎重的研究并决定优素福的职权由书记处集体负责，共同执行职务。优素福先生赞成这个决定。这个决定，只有经过书记处重新讨论上述问题并达成协议后，才能改变。任何单方面的行动，不能改变书记处的集体决议。因此所谓“移交职权”是非法的，对书记处没有任何约束力。
    书记处重申：亚非新闻工作者协会是一个独立的、群众性的国际组织，它不受任何一国记者组织的干预，也不受任何一国政府的干预。所谓由印度尼西亚政府、印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会和优素福三方面的会谈，同亚非新闻工作者协会无关，更不能向亚非新闻工作者协会发号施令。
    书记处郑重声明：坚决维护协商一致的原则，坚决维护一九六三年四月“雅加达宣言”和亚非新闻工作者大会和历届书记处会议的决议。书记处对于印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会新领导非法派出阿里芬·佩来干预亚非新闻工作者协会内部事务，坚决反对，坚不承认。
    书记处已经撤离雅加达，今后印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会的新领导所做的任何干涉亚非新闻工作者协会事务的事，都是非法的和无效的，它将遭到坚决反对和彻底的揭露。
