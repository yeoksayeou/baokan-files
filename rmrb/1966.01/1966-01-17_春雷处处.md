    Spring Thunder Everywhere
    The struggle of American blacks is like a spring thunder, resounding everywhere. Black demonstrations in Alabama are rising one after another. Following that, black demonstrations also broke out in Georgia and Mississippi.
    Police suppression and persecution by racists cannot stop American blacks from persisting in and expanding their demonstrations. The demonstrating masses are not afraid of police batons, nor are they afraid of the Ku Klux Klan. They angrily protest all kinds of fascist persecution and demand that murderers be punished. In particular, the black people of Georgia launched demonstrations to protest the state legislature's persecution of a state legislator who opposed American aggression in Vietnam. This all proves that the struggle of American blacks at the beginning of this year has shown the tenacity of their struggle and its clear political content.
    This cannot but be a new blow to the Johnson administration. In his State of the Union address, Johnson once again put on a hypocritical face and shed a few crocodile tears for American blacks, the poor, and the soldiers invading Vietnam, attempting to ease the pressure from the people at home. Now, American blacks have been the first to rise up and shatter Johnson's illusions, demonstrating that the awakening and struggle of the American people cannot be stifled by any deception or appeasement, and that the Johnson administration's predicament in pursuing its policy of aggression in Vietnam and other reactionary policies cannot be resolved.

    春雷处处
    美国黑人斗争，有如一声春雷，四处震响。亚拉巴马州的黑人示威，此伏彼起。接着，佐治亚州和密西西比州也爆发了黑人示威。
    警察的镇压，种族主义者的迫害，都阻止不了美国黑人坚持和扩大示威斗争。示威群众不怕警棍，也不怕三K党，他们愤怒抗议种种法西斯迫害，要求惩办凶手。特别是，佐治亚州黑人发动示威，抗议州议会迫害一名反对美国侵越的州议员。这都证明，今年美国黑人斗争一开始就表现了他们斗争的顽强性和鲜明的政治内容。
    这不能不是对约翰逊政府的新的打击。约翰逊在国情咨文中再度装出一副伪善面目，为美国黑人、穷人和侵越士兵，洒了几滴鳄鱼眼泪，妄图缓和国内人民的压力。现在，美国黑人首先起来打破了约翰逊的幻梦，表明了美国人民的觉醒和斗争是任何欺骗和安抚所窒息不了的，约翰逊政府在推行侵越政策和其他反动政策中所处的困境是解脱不了的。
