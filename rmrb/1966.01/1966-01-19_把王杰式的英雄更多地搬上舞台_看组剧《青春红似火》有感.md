    Bring More Heroes Like Wang Jie to the Stage
    ——Thoughts on the Group Drama "Youth as Red as Fire"
    Wang Chuanwei
    The name of Wang Jie is like a spring thunder, resonating strongly in everyone's heart. Learning from Wang Jie and striving to transform oneself into a Wang Jie-style soldier is the demand of today's era and the urgent wish of every revolutionary. The Jinan Military Region's Forward Drama Troupe timely wrote Wang Jie's deeds into the group drama "Youth as Red as Fire" to meet the audience, which is like "sending charcoal in the snow." After watching it, I felt very cordial and excited.
    The group drama "Youth as Red as Fire" consists of three one-act plays, "On the Construction Site," "Revolutionary Comrades," and "Youth as Red as Fire," and the Xiaolü Opera "Go Pick Up Wang Jie's Gun." The group drama selects several of the most vivid, moving, and representative typical plots to summarize the noble spiritual world of this great soldier.
    In the play "On the Construction Site," Wang Jie's appearance is written very movingly: Wang Jie's right hand was injured, and the instructor forced him to rest, and ordered the communicator to "guard" him. Due to the carelessness of the guard, Wang Jie disappeared. Two soldiers in the class discussed persuading Wang Jie to leave the construction site, which effectively highlighted Wang Jie's appearance. Through Wang Jie's skillful refusal of his comrades' dissuasion, especially his heroic actions in participating in rescue operations, the play reveals Wang Jie's inner beauty. In Wang Jie's view, being able to fight for the interests of the people is the greatest happiness.
    In "Revolutionary Comrades," through the plot of Wang Jie taking the initiative to help his old comrade-in-arms, the newly appointed platoon leader, write a night training "lesson plan," he vividly demonstrates his "no selfishness, no distractions," wholeheartedly for the revolution, everything for the revolution thought and mind. Although this play is small and the plot is simple, it has achieved a strong artistic effect because it deeply touches the character's spiritual realm. "Youth as Red as Fire" opens at a time when ten thousand rays of dawn are about to shine. Although Comrade Wang Jie had been on duty for two shifts in a row (taking one shift for the new soldier), he was still full of energy. When the instructor forced him to take a shift for him and let him rest, he secretly picked up the water bucket behind the instructor's back and left. Then, through the elementary school teacher asking him to introduce his experience in studying Chairman Mao's works; the militia of the mine warfare team, Ma Zhenkui, asking him to give another tutorial on mine laying technology; the Little Red Scarf asking him to get a haircut and tell revolutionary stories; the old lady asking him to eat a farewell meal (dumplings), Wang Jie's concern for others everywhere and his deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants are shown. Wang Jie truly did "put his limited life into the unlimited 'serving the people'." It is precisely because Wang Jie has the above-mentioned ideological foundation that his youth radiates the brilliance of the morning glow.
    The group drama does not let the audience immerse themselves in grief because it writes about Wang Jie's sacrifice, but gives us pride and strength. The last play, "Go Pick Up Wang Jie's Gun," is performed in the form of a Xiaolü Opera, reflecting the mass upsurge of people learning from Wang Jie and becoming Wang Jie-style soldiers. It makes the audience feel that Wang Jie is not dead, he is still alive, living in the hearts of each of us, encouraging us to move forward!
    If we still have any dissatisfaction with this group drama, it is that it does not reveal Wang Jie's noble spiritual outlook deeply and fully enough. Both "On the Construction Site" and "Youth as Red as Fire" still have a sense of listing deeds.
    After watching the group drama "Youth as Red as Fire" based on Wang Jie's deeds, it makes people think of a question: that is, how to quickly express the heroic figures in real life in the form of literature and art. In the past, there were various views on works that wrote about real people and real events. Now it seems that it is naturally unnecessary to limit literary and artistic creation to the circle of real people and real events; but we must never exclude and belittle literary and artistic works based on the real people and real events of heroic figures because of this. The era of heroes has created soldiers like Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, and Wang Jie... They are the typical representatives of Chinese youth and have a huge impact on the people of the whole country. If they are further artistically created, they will inevitably be warmly welcomed by readers and audiences, and will be more widely and enduringly circulated, producing greater educational and encouraging effects. We earnestly hope that in the future, more and better dramas showing Wang Jie-style heroes will appear on the stage. (Attached pictures)
    "On the Construction Site"
    ①Comrade Wang Jie regarded serving the people as the greatest happiness. Although his right hand was injured, he still secretly ran to the construction site to boil water for the soldiers with his other hand.
        "Revolutionary Comrades"
    ②Wang Jie is happy for every step forward his comrades make. When comrades encounter difficulties, he extends a warm hand. This is him helping the new platoon leader research the "night training" plan.
        "Youth as Red as Fire"
    ③Wang Jie sacrificed his life to protect his class brothers. The deputy squad leader gave the comrades of the militia squad the twenty copies of Chairman Mao's works that Wang Jie had bought for them before his death.
      "Go Pick Up Wang Jie's Gun"
    ④One Wang Jie falls, and thousands of Wang Jies stand up. Wang Jie's heroic actions are a model for people to learn from, and Wang Jie's noble thoughts encourage people to forge ahead bravely. Young man Li Xueying is determined to follow in Wang Jie's footsteps and join the army, which is warmly supported by his mother and fiancée.

### 把王杰式的英雄更多地搬上舞台——看组剧《青春红似火》有感

    把王杰式的英雄更多地搬上舞台
    ——看组剧《青春红似火》有感
    王传伟
    王杰的名字象一声春雷，在每一个人的心中都发出了强烈的回鸣。学习王杰，努力把自己改造为王杰式的战士，是今天时代的要求，也是每一个革命者的迫切愿望。济南部队前卫话剧团适时地把王杰的事迹写成组剧《青春红似火》与观众见面，正是“雪中送炭”。看了之后，感到非常亲切激动。
    组剧《青春红似火》是由《在工地上》、《革命战友》、《青春红似火》三个独幕话剧和小吕剧《去接王杰的枪》组成。组剧选取了几个最生动、最感人、最能体现王杰精神面貌的典型情节，概括出这个伟大战士的崇高的精神世界。
    《在工地上》这出戏，王杰的出场写得很动人：王杰右手受了伤，指导员强制他休息，并责成通讯员作“看守”，由于看守的疏忽，王杰不见了；班里的两个战士研究说服王杰离开工地的时候。对王杰的出场作了有力的烘托。通过王杰巧妙地拒绝了战友的劝阻，特别是参加抢险的英勇行动，揭示出王杰内在的美。在王杰看来：能为人民的利益而战斗是最大的幸福。
    在《革命战友》中，通过王杰主动地帮助老战友——新任排长写夜间训练“教案”的情节，生动地表现了他“一无私心，二无杂念”，一心为革命，一切为革命的思想和胸襟。这出戏虽小、情节单纯，但由于比较深刻地触到了人物的精神境界，所以收到了强烈的艺术效果。《青春红似火》在万朵朝霞即将放彩的时刻启幕，王杰同志虽然连续站了两班岗（替新战士站了一班），却仍精神抖擞，在指导员强行代岗，让他休息时，他却又背着指导员悄悄地挑起水桶走了。接着通过小学教师请他介绍学习毛主席著作的经验；地雷班民兵马振魁请他再辅导一次布雷技术；小红领巾找他理发、讲革命故事；老大妈请他吃告别饭（饺子）等几件事，就把王杰处处关心别人和对贫下中农群众的深厚阶级感情表现出来。王杰真正做到了“把有限的生命，投入到无限的‘为人民服务’之中”。王杰正因为有了以上那样的思想基础，所以他的青春放射出朝霞般的光辉。
    组剧并没有因为写王杰的牺牲，而让观众沉浸在悲痛中，给我们的是自豪和力量。最后一个戏《去接王杰的枪》是以小吕剧形式演出的，反映了人们学王杰，作王杰式的战士的群众性热潮。使观众感到王杰并没有死，他还活着，活在我们每个人的心中，鼓舞着我们前进！
    如果说这组剧我们还有不够满足的话，那就是它对王杰的崇高的精神面貌揭示得还不够深刻、丰满。《在工地上》和《青春红似火》都还有罗列事迹之感。
    看了以王杰事迹为基础的组剧《青春红似火》，使人联想到一个问题：即如何把现实生活中英雄人物迅速地用文艺的形式表现出来。过去对写真人真事的作品有各种看法，现在看来：把文艺创作局限于真人真事的圈圈里自然是不必要的；但决不能因此而排斥和贬低以英雄人物真人真事为基础的文艺作品。英雄的时代，造就出雷锋、欧阳海、王杰……这样的战士，他们是中国青年的典型，在全国人民中有着巨大的影响。如果再经过艺术的创造，就必然受到读者和观众的热烈欢迎，而得以更广泛更长久的流传，产生更大的教育鼓舞作用。我们殷切地期望，今后，有更多更好的表现王杰式英雄的戏剧出现在舞台上。（附图片）
    《在工地上》
    ①王杰同志把为人民服务看成是最大的幸福，虽然他右手受了伤，但仍偷偷跑到工地用他的另一只手为战士们烧水。
        《革命战友》
    ②王杰为自己的战友每前进一步而高兴，当同志遇到困难的时候，他就伸出热情的手，这是他正帮新任排长研究“夜训”计划。
        《青春红似火》
    ③王杰为了掩护自己的阶级兄弟而献出了自己的生命。副班长把王杰生前给民兵班同志买的二十本毛主席著作送给民兵班。
      《去接王杰的枪》
    ④一个王杰倒下去，千万个王杰站起来，王杰的英雄行动是人们学习的榜样，王杰的崇高思想鼓舞着人们奋勇前进。青年李学英立志沿着王杰的脚印前进，报名参军受到了母亲和未婚妻的热烈支持。
