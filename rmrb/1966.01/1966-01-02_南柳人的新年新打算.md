    New Year's Plans of the Nanliu People

    Once it enters "Minor Snow," the New Year is not far away! At this time, I was thinking, how should we Nanliu people welcome 1966?

    After the cadres and old poor peasants discussed it, they all said to build the fifteen pig farms before the ground freezes; if there are no bricks, we will haul stones from the river滩. Stones are strong and save money, what a great idea. So, more than forty of our young people immediately started working. In mid-November, the cold wind by the river whipped our faces, and white steam came out of our mouths, but the hearts of the young people were burning hot. Hauling a cart of stones, a round trip of more than ten *li*, walking hundreds of *li* a day, no one complained of being tired. After half a month of hard work, we hauled back three million *jin* of large stones from the river beach. The young people all understand that seizing every minute to build our socialist new Nanliu is the most meaningful way to welcome the New Year.

    In early December, I was very happy to hear that the leaders wanted me to report the experience of the Nanliu Brigade's Party Branch in leading the masses to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to comrades in the Handan and Xingtai Prefectures of Hebei Province. As a Communist Party member, I should promote Mao Zedong Thought more, that's also revolution! Taking this opportunity, I can also see and learn more.

    In these ten days or so, I have truly been walking, seeing, and learning all the way.

    Early on the morning of the 11th, we visited the Huanshui Brigade in Ren County. It is said that this brigade is the confluence point of nine waterways and suffers from disasters every year. However, the Huanshui people have been waging a tenacious struggle against the water for a long time. When houses are washed away by the water, they rebuild them as soon as the water recedes; if they are washed away again, they rebuild them again. Now, rows of brick houses that are not afraid of water have been built in the village, and they have also created high-yield ditches, dredged river channels, and built new bridges. Seeing all this, I deeply realized how important the ideological revolutionization of people is for promoting production!

    That afternoon, we also visited the Nanhui Brigade in Xingtai County. Along the way, we saw many commune members working hard in the fields, some carrying water, some hauling water with small flatbed carts, it was truly bustling. Some people poured a large bucket of water into each dirt pit, sprinkled fertilizer into the pit, covered it with soil, and piled it into a mound. When we asked the comrades in the county, we learned that this is a high-yield pit that can resist drought and ensure stable yields! Thinking of our Nanliu, which is also famous for being dry nine years out of ten, and we have to rely on carrying water to plant seeds when there is a drought, and it takes climbing four or five *li* of high slope to carry one load of water. During the busy farming season, time is tight and the work is heavy, and there is not so much water at one time, how difficult it is! If we also do two months of high-yield pits in winter, one laborer can make at least one *mu*… If we really do it, it would be amazing!

    Visiting the Nanhui Brigade gave us even greater inspiration! This brigade is surrounded by rocky mountains and has a total of nine hundred *mu* of land. In 1963, it suffered a major flood that washed away six hundred *mu* of good land in four hours. However, the Nanhui people were not intimidated. They straightened their chests, picked up the layers of stones on the ground, and piled them into earth dams; they also transported good soil from afar to pad the ground. After more than a year of hard work, more than four hundred *mu* of land have now been created. The revolutionary spirit of the Nanhui people is truly remarkable! In the past, the land here was full of pits and uneven, but now, at a glance, it is flat and tidy paddy field, and the wheat yield is more than four hundred *jin* per *mu*. After the visit, we wrote letters overnight to the Jiang County Party Secretary, the Nanfan Commune Secretary, and the Nanliu Brigade Party Branch Deputy Secretary, reporting in detail what we had personally seen, the revolutionary drive and rich production experience of the Hebei people in the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains."

    On the afternoon of the 14th, we arrived in Beijing. Early the next morning, we came to the long-awaited Agricultural Exhibition Hall. Here, the experiences of more than fifty advanced agricultural units of the Dazhai type from all over the country were exhibited. We looked at it carefully and felt that it was truly rich. The natural conditions of these advanced units were so difficult, some places had a frost-free period of only forty days, but as long as everyone has the determination and drive of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," the land can be changed, and the sky can be changed. Therefore, these red flag units have all achieved great increases in cotton and grain production.

    Every year on New Year's Day, as soon as the sun peeks out, the Nanliu people gather early and hold a lively New Year's gathering, and happily talk about their new plans for the New Year. 1966 is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. Five years look at three years, three years look at the first year, and the first year looks at this spring. The new plans of the Nanliu people for the New Year are to more consciously creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, learn the experiences of fraternal communes and teams even better, and strike the first blow this spring.

### 南柳人的新年新打算

    五年看三年，三年看头年，头年看今春。今年要更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，更好地学习兄弟社队经验，打响第一炮！
    南柳人的新年新打算
    山西省绛县南樊公社南柳大队党支部书记　周明山
    一进“小雪”，离新年就不远啦！这时心里寻思，我们南柳人该怎样来迎接一九六六年呢？
    干部和老贫农们一合计，都说赶封冻前，把那十五间猪场盖上；没有砖，就到河滩拉石头。石头又结实又省钱，这主意真好。于是，我们四十多个年青人立时就干开了。十一月中旬，河边的寒风刮得脸麻辣辣的，大家嘴里冒着白气儿，可年青人的心火热热的。拉一车石头，来回十多里，一天走百十里，没有一个叫累。大干半个月，从河滩上拉回来三百万斤大块石头。年青人都懂得，抓住每一分钟，建设咱们社会主义的新南柳，用这来迎接新年最有意义。
    十二月初，听到领导上要我到河北省邯郸、邢台两个专区，向同志们汇报南柳大队党支部领导群众活学活用毛主席著作的经验，我很高兴。共产党员就该多宣传毛泽东思想，这也是革命嘛！利用这个机会，我也可以多看点、多学点东西。
    出来这十多天，真是走一路，看一路，学一路。
    十一日一早，赶着参观访问了任县的环水大队。据说，这个大队是九条水的汇合点，年年遭灾。但是，环水人民长期与水进行着顽强的斗争，房屋被水冲塌了，水一退就盖房；再冲塌就再盖。现在，村里已盖起一排排不怕水的砖房，还创造了丰产沟，疏通了河道，建筑了新桥，看着这一切，使我深深地体会到，人的思想革命化，对于促进生产是多么重要啊！
    当天下午，我们又到邢台县南浍大队参观，一路上，看到许多社员在地里紧张地劳动，有些在担水，有些用小平车拉水，真是热气腾腾。有些人把一大桶水倒进一个个土坑里，又朝坑里撒上肥料，用土埋上，堆成土堆。问起县里的同志，才知道这就是能够抗旱稳产的丰产坑！想起我们南柳，也是有名的十年九旱，天旱要靠担水点种，担一趟水得爬四五里高坡。农忙时，时间紧，活又重，一时也没有那么多水，多难哪？要是也在冬天搞两个月的丰产坑，一个劳力最少能搞一亩……真要搞起来可了不得！
    参观了南浍大队，受到的启发就更大啦！这个大队周围都是石头山，一共有九百亩地。一九六三年遭了一场大洪水，四个钟头就冲毁了六百亩好地。但是，南浍人没有被吓倒，他们挺起胸膛，把地上的一层层石头拣起来，垒成地堰；又从远处运来好土垫地。经过一年多的艰苦奋战，现在已造地四百多亩。南浍人的革命精神真是了不起！过去这里的地尽是坑坑洼洼，高低不平，现在一眼望去是又平又整的水地，小麦亩产四百多斤。参观以后，我们连夜给绛县县委书记、南樊公社书记、南柳大队党支部副书记写了信，详细报告我们亲眼看到的河北人民那种“愚公移山”的革命干劲和丰富的生产经验。
    十四日下午，我们就到了北京。第二天一早，来到早已渴望的农业展览馆。这里展出了全国五十多个大寨式的农业先进单位的经验。我们仔细看了一遍，觉着真是丰富极了。这些先进单位，自然条件都是那样困难，有的地方无霜期只有四十天，可是，只要大伙儿有“愚公移山”的决心和干劲，地可换，天可改。所以，这些红旗单位都是棉粮大增产。
    年年一到元旦，太阳刚刚露头，南柳人早早就聚在一起，热热闹闹地开团拜会了，还要欢欢喜喜说说新年新打算。一九六六年是咱国家第三个五年计划的第一年。五年看三年，三年看头年，头年看今春。南柳人的新年新打算，就是要更自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，更好地学习兄弟社、队的经验，打响今春第一炮。
