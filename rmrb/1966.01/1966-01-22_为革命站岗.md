    Guarding the Revolution

    To demand the highest standards in one's work, one must closely link one's work with the cause of socialism. Serving the people is limitless, and transforming thought and improving work are also limitless.

    I am a traffic police officer in the Tenth Traffic Detachment. After graduating from junior high school in 1961, I began working in traffic control. Over the past two years, in the process of studying Chairman Mao's works, I have achieved some success in transforming my thinking and improving my work. Now I would like to share some of my experiences.

    Our task as traffic police is to stand guard, direct and guide various vehicles and pedestrians, and ensure the safety and convenience of the people's travel. How can we stand a good traffic guard post? Through studying Chairman Mao's works and years of practice, I have deeply realized that the most important thing is to have a revolutionary spirit of "being in the sentry box, having the motherland in your heart, and the world in your eyes," that is, to stand guard for the revolution and stand guard for the people.

    At our Kuanjie post, the northwest wind blows straight into the sentry box in winter, making it quite cold to stand guard. In the past, to avoid freezing myself, I would close the windows of the sentry box tightly, sit close to the side without wind to direct traffic, and even borrowed a leather overcoat from the class to wrap around my legs, fearing that I would get arthritis. After studying Chairman Mao's work "Continue to Maintain the Style of Hard Struggle," I felt that this was a manifestation of a lack of the thought of guarding the revolution. From then on, when I was on duty in winter, I would think: The colder the weather and the stronger the wind, the more cyclists and pedestrians crossing the road would cover their heads tightly, making it difficult to notice the vehicles coming and going, and they would not be able to hear me if I shouted. Therefore, I opened the windows of the sentry box. When there were many vehicles and people, I would stand up to direct traffic. One hand presses the traffic light button, and the other hand holds the loudspeaker to shout. The stronger the wind, the louder I shouted to suppress the sound of the wind. Although my lips were frozen stiff and my voice was hoarse, I felt that as long as the masses could pass through the intersection safely and smoothly, I would feel warm in my heart no matter how cold or tired I was.

    To demand the highest standards in one's work, one must closely link one's work with the cause of socialist construction. Take letting vehicles pass, for example. In the past, I thought that I was standing at the intersection, and vehicles were coming from all directions. To let this one pass, I had to stop that one. Anyway, I couldn't let them all pass. As for how to minimize the number of stops, I didn't think much about it. Once, when my comrades and I inspected the safety equipment of vegetable trucks outside Dongzhimen, we learned that one truck would consume more than two jiao of gasoline each time it stopped and started again. Later, through further understanding, I also learned that one sudden brake by a large vehicle would cost more than two yuan in gasoline consumption and wear and tear on the machinery. I thought that although stopping at intersections could not be completely avoided, if I caused vehicles that should not have stopped to stop, or caused sudden braking due to my improper direction, it would cause losses to the country. From then on, I paid attention to improving my directing methods, striving to minimize stops, especially striving to avoid sudden braking.

    Through this period of study and work practice, I deeply feel that serving the people is limitless, and transforming thought and improving work are also limitless. The process of studying Chairman Mao's works is the process of transforming thought and improving work. In the future, I must redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works, always, in everything, and everywhere taking Comrade Wang Jie and other heroic figures as examples, so that my work can constantly achieve discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, wholeheartedly standing a good traffic guard post for the revolution and contributing everything to the revolution.

### 为革命站岗

    为革命站岗
    要用最高标准要求自己的工作，就要把自己的工作和社会主义事业紧密地联系起来。为人民服务是无限的，改造思想、改进工作也是无限的
    我是交通十中队的民警，一九六一年初中毕业以后参加交通管理工作。两年多来，在学习毛主席著作的过程中，改造思想、改进工作获得了一些成绩。现在我来谈谈一些体会。
    我们交通民警的任务就是站岗，指挥疏导各种车辆和行人，保障人民群众行车走路的安全与便利。怎样站好交通岗呢？通过学习毛主席著作和几年来的实践，我深深体会到：最重要的是，要具备一种“身在岗亭，胸怀祖国，放眼世界”的革命精神，就是为革命站岗，为人民站岗。
    我们宽街岗一到冬天，西北风直往岗亭里灌，站岗时比较冷。过去，为了怕冻着自己，我就把岗亭的窗子关得严严的，紧贴着没有风的一边坐着指挥，还借了班里一件皮大衣裹着腿，生怕得关节炎。学习了毛主席著作《继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风》这篇文章后，我感到这是缺乏为革命站岗的思想表现。从此以后，冬天站岗时我就想：天越冷，风越大，骑自行车的和过马路的行人越会把脑袋捂得严严的，不容易发现来往的车辆，我喊话他们听不见，很不安全。所以，我就把岗亭的窗子打开。车多人多的时候，我就站起来指挥。一手按信号灯电钮，一手拿喊话筒喊话。风越大，为了把风声压过去，我喊话的声音也越大。虽然嘴唇冻得发僵，嗓子都喊哑了，我感到，只要群众安全顺利地通过路口，就是再冷再累，心里也觉得是热烘烘的。
    要用最高标准要求自己的工作，就要把自己的工作和社会主义建设事业紧密地联系起来。拿放行车辆来说吧。过去，我认为我站在路口，从四面来车，要放这个就得停那个，反正不能都放。至于怎样做到尽量少停车，我想得不多。有一次，我和同志们到东直门外检查运菜卡车的安全设备时，了解到一辆卡车，一停车，再一起车，就得耗费两角多钱的汽油。后来通过进一步了解，我又知道了，一辆大型汽车一次急刹车，消耗汽油和磨损机件合两块多钱。我就想到，在路口停车，虽然不是可以完全避免的，但由于自己平时指挥不当，使不该停的车停了，或者是造成急刹车，就要给国家造成损失。从此以后，我就注意改进指挥方法，力争做到少停车，特别是力争避免急刹车。
    通过这一段学习和工作的实践，我深深感到：为人民服务是无限的，改造思想、改进工作也是无限的。学习主席著作的过程，就是改造思想、改进工作的过程。今后，我一定要加倍努力地学习毛主席著作，时时、事事、处处以王杰同志等英雄人物为榜样，使自己的工作不断做到有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，全心全意地为革命站好交通岗，为革命贡献出自己的一切。
