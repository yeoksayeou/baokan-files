	Valuable Spiritual Support
	The Tianjin Lihua Shirt Cooperative and the Beijing Dahua Shirt Factory are a pair of competitors in the emulation, learning, catching up, and surpassing campaign. Not long ago, the Lihua Cooperative received a batch of shirt orders with a very tight delivery schedule, and their existing overlock sewing equipment was insufficient. What to do? The cooperative director decided to make a long-distance call to the Beijing Dahua Shirt Factory to see if they had any spare overlock machines.
	The response was straightforward: Yes, come and get them immediately.
	Comrades from the Tianjin Lihua Cooperative rushed to Beijing. As soon as they got off the train, they saw comrades from the Dahua Factory had already delivered two packaged overlock machines to the station, waiting there. They transported the overlock machines back to Tianjin, and after arriving home and unpacking them, they realized that these two machines had been taken off the production line by the brother factory; the machine casings still had some new fiber fuzz clinging to them, which hadn't even been wiped off yet.
	These two overlock machines from the Beijing Dahua Factory were undoubtedly a powerful support to the brother factory in Tianjin. But even more valuable is the spiritual gift that came with these two machines—the spirit of communist cooperation. While competing, learning, catching up, and surpassing each other, we should greatly promote this revolutionary spirit of helping each other.

### 可贵的精神支援

    可贵的精神支援
    天津利华衬衫社和北京大华衬衫厂，是比学赶帮超竞赛里的一组对手。不久以前，利华社接到了一批衬衫任务，交货时间很紧，现有包缝设备不够用。怎么办？社主任决定打个长途电话到北京大华衬衫厂试试，看他们有没有多余的包缝机。
    对方回答得很干脆：有，立即来取。
    天津利华社的同志赶到北京，刚下火车，就看到大华厂的同志已把两台包装好的包缝机送到车站，在那里等候着了。他们把包缝机搬回天津，到家后打开一看，才发现这两台机子是兄弟厂现从生产线上撤下来的，机壳上还挂着一些新的纤维毛毛，没有来得及擦掉呢。
    北京大华厂的这两台包缝机，对天津兄弟厂无疑是一个有力的支援。但是更可贵的，还是随着这两台机器同时送去的一份精神礼物——共产主义协作精神；在互相比，互相学，互相赶，互相超的同时，我们应该大大提倡这种互相帮的革命精神。
