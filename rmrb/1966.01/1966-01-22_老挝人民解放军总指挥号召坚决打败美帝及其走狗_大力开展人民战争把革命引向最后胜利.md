    According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 20th: Radio Pathet Lao broadcast that the Commander-in-Chief of the Lao People's Liberation Army Supreme Command, Khamtai Siphandon, issued an order on the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army (20th), calling on the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians to deepen their deep-seated hatred for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, vigorously and extensively develop people's war, resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and lead the revolution to final victory.

    The order pointed out that the Lao People's Liberation Army has continuously grown and become stronger in the struggle over the past seventeen years and has achieved brilliant victories.

    The order said that the Lao People's Liberation Army fought bravely and tenaciously, and together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, smashed all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and continuously pushed the revolution forward. At present, the Lao liberated areas occupy three-fifths of the country's land, including more than one million people.

    While fighting bravely, the Lao People's Liberation Army strives to strengthen political, military and other studies, improve its ideological and political level and military technology, and strengthen its spirit of serving the people and the revolution.

    The order said that the Lao People's Liberation Army also promotes the spirit of self-reliance and overcoming difficulties, vigorously increases production, and practices thrift to improve the lives of the troops and reduce the burden on the people.

    The order said that the aggressive and war-like nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. At present, in order to save itself from the disastrous defeats it has suffered in various places, U.S. imperialism is trying its best to expand its war of aggression to the entire Indochina.

    The order condemned U.S. imperialism for directing reactionary troops in Laos to attack and nibble at the liberated areas, dispatching U.S. aircraft to bomb and strafe the liberated areas, and plotting to expand the war of aggression against Laos and Indochina.

    The order emphasized that no matter what vicious conspiracies U.S. imperialism and its lackeys adopt, the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians are determined to fight bravely to the end, resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and push the revolution to complete victory.

    The order put forward five tasks for the Lao soldiers and civilians to vigorously and extensively develop the people's war and resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys: First, deepen the deep-seated hatred for the enemy, promote the firm and heroic fighting spirit of revolutionary fighters, develop guerrilla warfare, and resolutely smash the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Second, promote the spirit of serving the people and the revolution unconditionally, deeply and widely publicize various policies among the masses, publicize the work of establishing grassroots units, abide by mass discipline, help the people increase production, and build the liberated areas. Third, closely integrate combat tasks with construction tasks, work hard to study politics, military affairs and culture, and continuously improve the level of political ideology and tactics and technology. Fourth, promote the spirit of not fearing hardship and overcoming difficulties, promote the spirit of self-reliance, vigorously increase production, and practice thrift. Fifth, strengthen the unity between the Lao People's Liberation Army and the patriotic neutral armed forces, help each other, make progress together, and complete the noble task of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the country.

    The order said that all our cadres and soldiers must pour hatred into the muzzles and bayonets of their guns, actively fight, establish grassroots units, increase production, practice thrift, strengthen the cultivation of their own positions, ideas, and revolutionary qualities, promote the glorious tradition, not fear difficulties, not fear sacrifice, and bravely move forward for the lofty interests of the motherland and the people, severely strike at U.S. imperialism and traitorous lackeys, and lead the revolution to final victory.
