    Having a Global Perspective
    In 1962, among the mineral resources allocated to the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant by the state, there was a type of Hainan Island ore. This iron ore had a high iron content, which was beneficial for iron smelting, but it required long-distance transportation, costing the state a large sum of freight. In order to save freight costs for the state, the staff of the iron and steel plant took the initiative to suggest to the relevant departments to use ore produced from nearby iron mines instead. These ores had a low iron content and contained more impurities such as sulfur, which was unfavorable for iron smelting. At that time, some people said: Since the state has already allocated good ore, why not use it and go looking for trouble? But they did not waver. They said: As long as it is beneficial to the country, we will endure any hardship! They actively improved operating techniques and used ore with low iron content and many impurities, still ensuring the high quality and high yield of the blast furnace. Throughout the year, by using fifty thousand tons less of Hainan Island ore, they saved the state more than 14 million yuan in freight.
    On some issues, is it "looking for trouble," or is it seeking comfort? This is indeed a test, testing whether we are wholeheartedly serving the revolution or doing it half-heartedly. Is it truly "having the motherland at heart," or is it merely "having the plant at heart"? The Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant adopted the former attitude in the use of ore, demonstrating the high style of a revolutionary.

    胸中有全局
    一九六二年，国家分配给石钢炼铁厂的矿石资源中有一种海南岛矿。这种铁矿石含铁量高，对炼铁有利，但要远途运输，花费国家很大一笔运费。炼铁厂职工为了给国家节约运费，主动建议上级有关部门改用附近铁矿生产出来的矿石。这些矿石含铁量低，含硫磺等杂质较多，对炼铁不利。当时有人说：既然国家已经给调拨了好矿，为啥不用，去自找苦吃？但他们并没有动摇，他们说：只要对国家有利，再大的苦我们也要去吃！他们积极改进操作技术，使用含铁量低、杂质多的矿石，照样保证了高炉的优质、高产。全年由于少用了五十多万吨海南岛矿石，为国家节约运费达一千四百多万元。
    在一些问题上，是“自找苦吃”，还是贪图安逸？这的确是一种考验，考验我们是全心全意为革命，还是打点折扣为革命。是真正
  “胸怀祖国”，还是仅仅“胸怀本厂”？石钢炼铁厂在利用矿石的问题上，采取了前一种态度，显示了革命者的高风格。
