    Harriman Exposes the Shadow Play
    Johnson launched his fourteen-point proposal, desperately pretending that the United States was seeking "unconditional negotiations," saying that anything would be fine as long as the Vietnamese people were willing to talk. However, his "peace envoy" Harriman, while peddling the "peace talks" fraud, immediately exposed the shadow play.
    Answering a reporter's question about whether there had been any change in the U.S. policy towards Vietnam, Harriman said unequivocally, "No, quite the opposite." He loudly proclaimed that the United States would not "retreat" from South Vietnam.
    What the U.S. policy towards Vietnam is, is very clear to everyone. In Johnson's words, it is that "the United States cannot withdraw from South Vietnam," "We will never retreat, whether it is an overt retreat or a retreat disguised by a meaningless agreement." Although Johnson has recently been saying that the four points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can be "discussed together" and that "we do not want to keep American troops in South Vietnam after peace is assured," everyone understands that the United States' established policy of clinging to South Vietnam will not change, and Harriman has now publicly confirmed this.
    Since the U.S. policy of permanently occupying South Vietnam has not changed, and "quite the opposite," the United States will never "retreat" from South Vietnam, then isn't it very clear that the U.S. advocacy of "negotiations" is merely an attempt to obtain at the negotiating table what it cannot obtain on the battlefield? Of course, the likes of Johnson also know that they cannot achieve their goals. Therefore, Harriman, this "peace envoy," while peddling the "peace talks" fraud, vigorously demands more cannon fodder and prepares for expanding the war.
    The Johnson administration's so-called "peace offensive" is a smokescreen to cover up the conspiracy to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, which is once again proven by Harriman's words and deeds.

### 哈里曼拆穿西洋镜

    哈里曼拆穿西洋镜
    约翰逊抛出他的十四点主张，竭力假装美国是在谋求“无条件的谈判”，只要越南人民肯谈，什么都好说。但是，他的“和平特使”哈里曼在兜售“和谈”大骗局的时候，却一下子把西洋镜拆穿了。
    哈里曼回答记者提出的美国对越南政策是否有任何改变的问题，斩钉截铁地说：“没有，恰恰相反”。他高声叫嚷，美国将不从南越“后退”。
    美国对越南的政策是什么，那是大家都很清楚的。用约翰逊的话来说，就是
  “美国不能退出南越”，“我们决不会撤退，无论是公开撤退，还是在一个没有意义的协议的掩饰下撤退。”尽管约翰逊最近口口声声说什么越南民主共和国的四点主张可以“一起讨论”，什么“我们并不希望在和平得到确保以后把美国军队继续留在南越”，谁都明白，美国要死赖在南越的既定政策是不会改变的，现在哈里曼公开予以证实。
    既然，美国永久霸占南越的政策没有改变，而且“恰恰相反”，美国决不从南越“后退”，那末美国主张“谈判”只不过是想从谈判桌上取得它在战场上得不到的东西，这不是十分明白的吗？当然，约翰逊之流也知道，他们是不可能达到目的的。因此，哈里曼这个“和平特使”在兜售“和谈”骗局的同时，就大力催索炮灰，为扩大战争作准备。
    约翰逊政府的所谓“和平攻势”，是掩盖进一步扩大侵越战争阴谋的烟幕，这从哈里曼的言行得到再一次证明。
