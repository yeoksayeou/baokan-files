Title: The Song of Ouyang Hai
Author: Jin Jingmai

Edition: 5

Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper publishes three sections from the novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai." This is a good novel. It is one of the new achievements made by Chinese literary workers in recent years in further revolutionizing themselves and implementing the Mao Zedong line on literature and art. This novel successfully portrays a typical Lei Feng-like new communist person. Through the growth process of the hero Ouyang Hai, the novel vividly depicts the life and spirit of the Chinese people, especially the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and profoundly summarizes the ideological qualities and character traits of millions of revolutionary soldiers of our era.

The novel portrays the heroic path Ouyang Hai walked in just twenty-three years. This son of a poor peasant, born in a remote mountain village, although subjected to cruel class oppression, had seeds of spontaneous hatred sown in his young heart. However, the transformation from yearning to become a hero, but not yet being one, to already being a hero without consciously being one, is the result of the Party's nurturing and cultivation, and the tempering and training in the great crucible of the revolutionary army. It marks the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in cultivating the spiritual qualities of new communist people. The diaries of Lei Feng and Wang Jie have already educated us with facts. Ouyang Hai in the novel will also inspire our vast number of young people with his vivid artistic image to move a step further toward a more revolutionary goal.

The image of Ouyang Hai is a heroic model for revolutionary people who are not afraid of hardship or death, who are dedicated to revolution, and who work for the sake of revolution. His ordinary yet great life fully demonstrates to people: how a revolutionary soldier should treat his career, his ideals, his difficulties, his honor, his criticism, his self-transformation, his personal and collective relationships, and his relationships with comrades and family with the correct attitude. These are the problems that Ouyang Hai and each of us will encounter on the road to growth. Ouyang Hai sets a shining example for us.

"A loud drum also needs heavy hammering."

The province was going to hold a meeting of representatives of militia activists. The higher authorities instructed that a good squad leader be selected from the Third Company to attend the meeting and give a bayonet drill demonstration for the militia representatives. The branch committee was studying this issue. Most of the branch committee members agreed that Ouyang Hai should go: in terms of bayonet skills, he was the best in the entire company; and he was also one of the best squad leaders in all aspects, whether it was tactics, shooting, grenade throwing, or sports. A few branch committee members suggested that Liu Weicheng should go. Although his bayonet skills were not as strong as Ouyang Hai's, he had made greater progress recently and was also more steady.
	"Yes, Ouyang Hai is too impetuous," one branch committee member said. "He likes to give opinions on everything, which can easily create a negative impact."
	"Liking to give opinions cannot be considered a shortcoming!" branch secretary Zeng Wujun said. "As long as it is to help the leadership and improve the work, liking to give opinions should be considered an advantage of being responsible for the revolution!"
	"Then I agree to let Ouyang Hai go," that branch committee member said.
Zeng Wujun looked around and saw that no one had any objections, so he stood up and said:
	"My opinion is to let Liu Weicheng go. This comrade has consistently done good work, and his thinking has also made great progress recently, especially in correcting his arrogance and complacency. As for Ouyang Hai, I have been considering his problems for a long time. Yes, he is a very good comrade, but he is somewhat competitive and eager for honor. Honor is not good for him at the moment." He talked about the recent grass-cutting incident, and finally said, "... When he was insisting on going to Tibet, we must see his positive side; when he makes many achievements, we must not ignore his shortcomings. Even some minor details should not be missed. Especially now, when he is applying to join the Party, in order to be truly responsible for a comrade's progress, we should demand even more strictly of him."
	"Ouyang Hai is already very good!" Guan Yingkui said. "It's not easy to want to be first in everything and be able to achieve it. Frankly speaking, I'm most afraid of that kind of soldier: he doesn't care if he doesn't do a good job, and he's still slow and unhurried even after being criticized. I think it's better to let Ouyang Hai go. A loud drum doesn't need heavy hammering. A little nudge will make him understand. Otherwise, it will dampen his enthusiasm."
	"Enthusiasm must have a correct ideological foundation. You, Lao Guan! On the surface, you are very strict with Ouyang Hai, glaring at him at every turn. But in fact, you are too indulgent with him. The more excellent a soldier is, the higher the demands should be made of him, so that he can progress faster. The saying 'A fast horse doesn't need a whip, and a loud drum doesn't need heavy hammering' is not necessarily appropriate. A loud drum also needs heavy hammering, so the sound will be even louder!"
Guan Yingkui laughed: "What? I, I'm not strict with him?..."
	"You are strict in front of his face, but soft-hearted behind his back. No matter which meeting it is, you rarely talk about his shortcomings and inadequacies."
	"What you said is indeed the truth," Guan Yingkui said, nodding his head.
	"I am just giving my personal opinion. Everyone should consider it further," Zeng Wujun continued. "Ouyang Hai's basic problem of why to make revolution has been basically solved, starting from his pure class feelings. How to make revolution, how to be a pure person as Chairman Mao teaches, depends on his own efforts and the efforts of our branch to spend more time on him!"
Guan Yingkui thought for a while and said, "I agree with Lao Zeng's opinion. Let Liu Weicheng go to attend the militia meeting. As for whether it will dampen Ouyang Hai's enthusiasm..."
Zeng Wujun interrupted and said, "That depends on how well we do our work. If we do it well, it will not only not dampen his enthusiasm, but will also enable him to take a big step forward from the existing foundation. This work..." He said to a branch committee member, "Chen Yonglin is not here. Your Party group should hurry up and talk to him more."
That comrade nodded. The branch committee members all agreed with this opinion.
	"Then it's decided," Guan Yingkui said. "The branch is cultivating him, so this can be considered a specific test for him!"

The test came to Ouyang Hai.

From the moment Guan Yingkui announced that Liu Weicheng would be attending the militia conference, Ouyang Hai lowered his head and didn't say a word. When the squad meeting was held to discuss this issue, Ouyang Hai, who always had a lot to say, only said, "Let's talk about it," and then said nothing more. ...
On the drill ground, the shouts of killing were constant. Guan Yingkui was leading Liu Weicheng and several other comrades in practicing bayonet fencing. Liu Weicheng was about to go to the province. In addition to learning from others at the conference, he also had to show some real skills in order to effectively guide the militia in practicing bayonet skills. Otherwise, what was the point of calling it a "demonstration performance?"

Liu Weicheng, with his broad shoulders and thick waist, stood there imposingly in his full protective armor. Several soldiers took turns going up against him, and they were all stabbed by him one by one. Guan Yingkui waved the small flag; Xiao Huang, the entertainment committee member, was a volunteer announcer. He shouted at the top of his voice:
	"One to zero!"
	"Two to zero!"
	"Three to zero! Another one falls. Who's next?"
	"Company Commander! The Company Commander is going up himself!"
Guan Yingkui waved his hand and said, "I can't do it."
	"Comrades!" a platoon leader shouted loudly to the surrounding comrades. "Let the Company Commander go up! When we stormed Dayuan, he stabbed three enemies to death all by himself. That's not all," he pointed to the back of Guan Yingkui's head, "he still has a 'glorious scar' on the back of his head!"
Guan Yingkui blushed and said, "Who told you that? That time, I was almost stabbed to death by the enemy! Thanks to our..."
Zeng Wujun interrupted and said, "I can testify! He did stab enemies to death that time, but not three, but three and a half—one of them had his intestines pulled out by him and ran away clutching his stomach."
	"Come on, clap!" With the platoon leader's words, rhythmic applause rang out in the field.
	"Okay!" Guan Yingkui thought, there was always an opening on Liu Weicheng's left side. He had reminded him several times, but he still couldn't correct it. He had to let him suffer a little to make him pay attention. He changed into his protective helmet and said to Zeng Wujun, who was standing beside him:
	"Lao Zeng, I'm afraid I really can't beat him!" After saying that, he held his gun level and opened his stance. Through the protective helmet, his eyes stared fiercely at Liu Weicheng, waiting for his attack.
Liu Weicheng knew the Company Commander's skills. He pondered on the spot for a while before suddenly stabbing with his gun. Guan Yingkui had expected him to make this move. He seized the opportunity and deflected the gun with his hand. With a clang, he stabbed Liu Weicheng in the left chest.
	"One to zero!" Xiao Huang shouted.
The comrades watching the battle also shouted: "Old is still spicy!"
	"An old general goes into action, one is worth two!"
	"..."
In the second round, Guan Yingkui didn't gain any advantage. After a few rounds, Liu Weicheng returned the favor with a stab.
	"One to one! What a neck and neck match. Now it depends on the last shot to determine the victory!" Xiao Huang said.
No one easily made a move in the third shot. Eyes looked at eyes, the tips of the guns faced each other, circling around a non-existent center. Everyone wanted to find the other's flaw before stabbing. They remained in a stalemate for a while. Guan Yingkui suddenly shouted loudly, like a thunderbolt splitting down, shaking the ground. Liu Weicheng was stunned by this sudden situation. While he was hesitating, Guan Yingkui's gun tip rushed towards his left side again. Relying on his large size and strong strength, he barely dodged this shot. But despite his left parry and right block, forward and backward movement, he still couldn't escape the passive situation. In a moment of quick wit, he also screamed strangely and took advantage of the situation to stab with his gun. Guan Yingkui saw that he couldn't dodge in time, so he simply went up to meet him. The two of them stabbed each other at the same time.
The applause and cheers never subsided.
Xiao Huang was anxious instead. He shouted: "This, how should this be counted?... Just do one point five to one point five, a tie."
Guan Yingkui took off his protective helmet and said, "No, I should be counted as losing. On the battlefield, we advocate striving to take the initiative to attack the enemy. In peacetime training, we must also encourage the spirit of actively attacking. This gun just now, the big guy was active, according to the regulations, the big guy should be judged to win. In addition, he stabbed more bravely and fiercely than me. He was fast but not chaotic, brave and resourceful. But he still has problems, but I can't cure him. Tell you, if our instructor hadn't been injured that year, he would have been the real boss. When Dayuan was attacked, his bayonet was famous throughout the division. If it wasn't for him, my neck would probably have been twisted to the back long ago! If he comes up, he can still fight with the big Liu for a while."
	"Lao Guan, why are you making fun of me!" Zeng Wujun said.
	"The big guy has made progress really fast!" someone said.
	"It seems that no one can cure him for the time being. Even the Company Commander has lost!" someone echoed.
	"You wait a minute, wait for me to find someone who can cure the big guy!" Guan Yingkui ran back to the dormitory and said to Ouyang Hai, who was reading in the room:
	"Go, practice bayonet fencing with the big Liu!"
	"I can't," Ouyang Hai was still holding a book in his hand.
	"What's your attitude? The big Liu is lacking your skills. There is always an opening on his left side. He has to suffer a little to pay attention. Quick! Stab him a few times."
	"Company Commander..."
	"What are you mumbling about? Come on!"
On the drill ground, people were discussing who dared to go up and fight again when a soldier in full gear ran over with Guan Yingkui. He separated the crowd and stood in the middle of the field; although he was short, his bow stance was full of energy, and the protective helmet was tightly fastened on his head. For a moment, no one could recognize who he was.
	"Who is this?"
	"There are really people who are not afraid of 'death'!"
	"Since he's here, he must have a 'diamond drill' in his hand!"
	"Yes! There are mountains beyond mountains, and heavens beyond heavens!"
The soldiers discussed one after another.
	"Prepare!" Xiao Huang told Big Liu.
	"Start!"
Liu Weicheng stood like a monument, really with an imposing manner that could not be blown down by the wind or struck by thunder. Just as he had chosen a favorable terrain and carefully observed the other party's weaknesses, the little guy unexpectedly made a "thrust," and the gun was so fast and powerful! Liu Weicheng was stabbed.
	"Hey!… One to zero!"
Before Xiao Huang could finish speaking, Liu Weicheng rushed up with his gun. The little guy stayed where he was, waiting for work in comfort. His left parry and thrust followed so closely that they were tighter than the machine gun's bursts. With two thumps, it was like two guns were sticking out at the same time—one blocking and one stabbing. Liu Weicheng was hit with another shot on his left chest.
	"Two, two, two—to zero!" Xiao Huang's voice changed its tone.
These two shots were stabbed cleanly and neatly, completely beyond Liu Weicheng's expectations. Before he had time to think about the reasons for his failure, the little guy rushed up again. He opened his stance and decided to fight the other party to the end. But who knew that the little guy made a feint and, before he could act, suddenly pulled. He only felt a numbness in his palm, and another clang on his left chest.
	"Three to zero! Good, there is always someone stronger, there are capable people beyond capable people!" Xiao Huang shouted happily.
	"Salt water points tofu—one thing subdues another."
	"Wonderful!" Xiao Wei also shouted, "This is the most wonderful, the most, most wonderful three shots I have ever seen."
Guan Yingkui beckoned them both and said, "Come, come, come! Let's study it. Big guy, just now these three shots all hit your left side, which shows..." Before he finished speaking, the little guy was gone.
Zeng Wujun, like the comrades, was attracted by the little guy's skilled marksmanship. When he turned his head and saw the little guy slipping out of the crowd, leaving only Liu Weicheng standing there alone, he realized: Oh no! Ideological work has not kept up.
Ouyang Hai returned to the dormitory. He had just taken off his protective gear when Zeng Wujun followed him in.
	"Ouyang Hai, your marksmanship is good!"
	"Hehe." Ouyang Hai smiled. It wasn't clear whether he agreed with the instructor or not.
	"But we don't advocate stabbing like you!" Zeng Wujun said angrily. "Practicing fencing is for mutual learning and common improvement, not just to compete for who wins and loses. Who is Liu Weicheng? He is your comrade, the representative sent by the company! He represents the whole company, and he also represents you, Ouyang Hai! When he has shortcomings, should we quickly point them out to him and help him improve, or should we stab him three times like you and turn around and leave?"
	"I..."
	"It's true that Liu Weicheng's bayonet skills are not as strong as yours. But can we adopt your attitude toward a comrade who still has some shortcomings? You must know that this representative is representing the whole company and representing the troops to do work, helping him is helping work, and helping the militia activist representative conference. Obviously, your idea of being unconvinced hinders you from understanding this issue in this way. Ouyang Hai, maybe I have taken the problem too seriously, I think that through today's incident, it reflects that your understanding of 'representative' is not correct enough, you have too much regarded it as a kind of honor, so you did not think that you should help Liu Weicheng overcome his bayonet problems. Even if it is honor, Ouyang Hai, we revolutionaries never care about it. We want to compare our loyalty to the Party, compare our dedication to serving the people wholeheartedly, we never compare honors with our comrades."
Ouyang Hai had never seen the instructor so excited, nor had he ever been criticized so harshly. Zeng Wujun's words made him feel that the problem was very serious, but he couldn't sort out the clues for a while.
	"... In the battle to attack Dayuan, our Company Commander Guan—who was still a new recruit at that time—and another comrade captured a heavy machine gun. At that time, capturing a heavy machine gun would be a great achievement. The battle was very intense. After the battle was over, neither of them could figure out who captured the heavy machine gun first. The leaders wanted to give them credit, but they pushed each other back and forth, and neither of them wanted the credit. Ouyang Hai, what was it for? To 'Attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive,' to liberate the whole of China!—For them, this was much more important than ten 'great achievements.' It was for this ideal that they joined the army, fought, and were wounded. Before the wounds were completely healed, they continued to charge and fight. What about us today? Except for Taiwan Province, the whole country has been liberated and entered a socialist society. The great communist ideal is inspiring us. We should stand higher and see further than the new recruits of that year!"
Seeing that Ouyang Hai lowered his head to his chest and didn't speak, Zeng Wujun continued to speak: "I talked to you about cutting pig grass last time, so that you could think carefully about everything and consider it more comprehensively. Doing a good job in your own squad can certainly play a role in driving the whole company, but isn't helping those comrades who are a little worse than yourself more able to promote the work? Since a comrade is determined to fight for the communist cause to the end, then his words and deeds, every move he makes, should be carried out under the guidance of this lofty ideal, and should be worthy of the determination he has expressed to the Party. Think carefully again today: You knew Liu Weicheng's shortcomings, didn't specifically point them out, stabbed three times and turned around and left, is it right? How can it be more beneficial to the work?"
When the fencing was going on just now, Ouyang Hai stabbed Liu Weicheng three times. How he stabbed it, what place he stabbed it, his feeling at that time was not specific; and now every word and every word that the instructor said to him, like guns went straight to his heart, making him realize deeply while in pain: "I made a mistake, something went wrong! The Company Commander said clearly, let me practice fencing with Liu Weicheng; the instructor said clearly, let me think about everything I do. Why did I stab three times and turn around and leave, why didn't I think about whether it was right to do so when I turned around?... Alas! I am really confused! When there is a little achievement in the work, the vision should be seen further. But I..." Ouyang Hai frowned and said to himself, "It doesn't matter, as long as I can think about everything I do from now on, it's still in time!" He slowly raised his head, ready to pour out the regret in his heart to the instructor. But the instructor was gone. ...
The clerk stood in front of Ouyang Hai and asked:
	"Where is the instructor? Wasn't he talking to you just now?"
Ouyang Hai nodded inexplicably: "Yes, it was just now, it was here, but..."
	"Alas! A person of such a great age is still playing 'hide-and-seek' with me!" The clerk shook a form in his hand and said, "The higher authorities want the cadres to fill out a form. The instructor just won't fill in the column for meritorious service and awards. I heard that the Company Commander knows more about it. I went to ask the Company Commander, and the Company Commander said that he couldn't remember it clearly. He had made at least five great achievements, so he told me to ask him himself; I came to ask the instructor, but the instructor simply hid and didn't want to meet me!"
Ouyang Hai's heart suddenly felt as if the blood in his whole body was speeding up, and his heart was beating even tighter. He looked at the form in the clerk's hand and said to himself: "It seems that the instructor is the combat hero, is the good comrade who captured the machine gun! Others don't want the honor they see, what, what stupid things am I doing!"
The chicken crowed for the third time, and Ouyang Hai was in so much pain that he couldn't sleep in bed. He thought of wrestling, hammering, cutting pig grass, and the three shots he stabbed during the day. What kind of road has he taken this year or so? He joined the regiment, made meritorious service, and became a model soldier of various kinds. He was commended many times, and he thought he was running forward on a heroic road. In fact, not only was he standing still in many places, but he was also retreating in some places! ... Thinking of this, Ouyang Hai shuddered. "It's really scary! Chairman Mao wants us to be a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, and a person who is free from low tastes. What have I done?" He felt sorry for Secretary Zhou, sorry for the Company Commander, the instructor, and Comrade Liu Weicheng. He took out a book from under his pillow, looked at Dong Cunrui holding a bomb pack on the cover, and various questions came to his mind again: How can I become a real hero? What is a real hero? Should I aspire to be a hero? ... Ouyang Hai has not completely understood these questions; but he understands one thing: he has to tell everything he thinks to the Party and ask for the Party's criticism and help.
Ouyang Hai couldn't wait to sit up, spread the paper flat on his knees, and, with tears of shame in his eyes, wrote a review to the branch committee by the light of a flashlight. Respected Party branch:
Today, I realized that I am too far away from the requirements of a Party member. ...
The chicken crowed twice more, and Zeng Wujun had not slept yet. He was flipping through Ouyang Hai's previous ideological summaries at his desk while thinking: It is impossible for a young soldier of nineteen to consider the problem so comprehensively. Some competitive thoughts are inevitable. What's more, the Company Commander asked him to fence today. He just didn't actively help Liu Weicheng. Is such heavy criticism too much for a soldier who has only been in the army for a little over a year? Can he take it? Will it dampen his "tiger" energy and enthusiasm and make him lose his confidence in making progress in the future? ... Zeng Wujun had not completely come to an answer to these questions.
Outside the window on the drill ground, there was a burst of crackling fighting sounds. Zeng Wujun looked up: in the faint morning light, two black shadows were fencing. The small black shadow stopped from time to time to explain something, and then fenced again. Although it was still dark, he could not see who it was, but from the familiar figure of the big and small ones, Zeng Wujun felt that the problem that had troubled him all night had been basically solved.
	"Oh! It's dawn!" Zeng Wujun turned off the lights and stood up. He looked at the two fencing figures on the drill ground, and there was an indescribable feeling of comfort in his heart: The most important responsibility of a political worker is to correctly implement the Party's policies and ensure that the Party's intentions are reflected in the work; the greatest pleasure is to see that comrades are constantly progressing and moving forward by leaps and bounds under the guidance of the Party. He slowly walked to the window, facing a gust of humid morning wind, looked deeply at the tiger-like little guy, looked and looked, he couldn't help but say:
	"What a conscious good soldier!"

Sailing Far Away

The heavy rain barely stopped after pouring for more than two days, but the sky was still covered with dark clouds, and not a trace of blue sky could be seen.
The troops waded across a small river and were marching along the road. For several days, rapid marches in heavy rain and mud had exhausted the comrades. Diarrhea from enteritis consumed Ouyang Hai's strength, and he felt that each step was more difficult than the last. Ahead, a red-brown warhorse galloped towards them, and the cavalry communicator brought instructions from the headquarters: Company commanders were to go to the front for a meeting, and the troops were to rest in place and await orders.
The comrades sat down near the road, regardless of whether it was mud or water. Before Ouyang Hai's butt had even touched the ground, he was busy finding out about the situation of all the comrades in the squad. Some comrades' backpacks were completely soaked through, and the forty-pound luggage now weighed at least sixty pounds; more comrades had become "soaked" soldiers. When Wei Wuyue saw the squad leader walking towards him, he quickly hid his blistered feet in his raincoat.
Ouyang Hai had already seen Xiao Wei's clumsy disguise. He walked up and said:
	"Xiao Wei, are you having a hard time!"
	"I'm fine! Since joining the army for more than a year, I think this is the most relaxed, the most, most relaxed march. You should care more about the comrades." Xiao Wei's face put on an unnatural smile.
Ouyang Hai's heart was warm. He was moved by Xiao Wei's extremely ordinary performance. How fast! Some time ago, he sometimes liked to read comic books, sometimes liked to play military chess. He was a little devil who completely handled things according to his interests, but now he also understood to overcome his own difficulties, adapt to the needs of the revolution, and share the worries of the collective. He had to continue marching even with blisters on his feet. This was originally the tradition of the army. But shown in Xiao Wei's body, Ouyang Hai felt deeply that in the face of this difficulty, everyone wanted to take out the greatest strength to share the burden of the country, and everyone was using a fighting posture to meet this emergency task! He walked over silently and grabbed Xiao Wei's rice bag and carried it on his shoulder. Being able to reduce one or two burdens for his comrades as a squad leader made him feel comfortable in his heart. The road had to move forward.
	"Tell me," Gao Yizhong cocked his foot and asked Xiao Wei beside him, "Why do feet get blisters?"
	"The most taboo, the most, most taboo thing about long marches is wearing new shoes. We both broke the taboo, so how could we not get blisters?" Xiao Wei said, "This is all because our preparations were not done well, and we didn't consider it thoroughly beforehand."
	"No." Gao Yizhong said mischievously, "New shoes and old shoes are secondary; the main reason is that the number of times the soles of the feet rub against the earth is too high, exceeding the limit of what it can do, which is why the skin and flesh separated—we call the gap between the skin and flesh 'blisters'."
Xiao Wei smiled and said, "Heh! You are a high school student after all. When you talk, you always make things round the corner."
	"This is science. There is a limit to everything: eating, you can only eat six hectoliters at a time—zero point one three two gallons. This is the largest capacity in the stomach. Walking, you can't walk too far at a time. If you exceed the limit and violate science, it will bring pain."
	"Xiao Gao, I don't agree with your statement. Your 'science' is not applicable to us either." Ouyang Hai walked up and said, "According to what you said, wouldn't the Long March be unscientific? When the Red Army crossed the grassland, where could they find 'six hectoliters' of rice to eat? But they ate wild vegetables, grass roots, and even leather belts, and they still won battles! Which veteran Red Army soldier doesn't have blisters on his feet? But they stepped on blisters and still completed the 25,000-mile Long March!"
	"This...this..." Xiao Gao was speechless.
Ouyang Hai continued, "As long as the struggle requires it, not to mention a few blisters on the feet, even if both legs are broken, you have to crawl forward. This is also a science—the science of revolution. The veteran Red Army soldiers won battles with this science. Today, we must also win battles with this science!"
	"Yes! I 'surrender.' The science that the squad leader said seems to be more scientific than my 'science'." Gao Yizhong's words made everyone laugh.
Ouyang Hai took out a small piece of soap from his satchel and handed it to Gao Yizhong and said:
	"Hurry up and take advantage of the time to shake the sand out of your shoes and put some soap on the soles of your socks and the edges of your shoes. Although this is not very 'scientific,' it can work. Otherwise, you would blame the number of times you rubbed against the earth too many times, the skin and flesh are separated, and so on. Blaming and blaming is useless." After he finished speaking, he laughed too. ...
The bugle call to continue moving forward came from the front, and the comrades stood up with a swoosh, ready to move forward again. Guan Yingkui rushed back from the front. He waved his hand to stop everyone and shouted:
	"Comrades, we have arrived. This is our destination."
	"Arrived?" The comrades were all surprised. At this time, they remembered to look at the surrounding environment: a low-lying area between two mountains, with no village in front and no shop behind, and not even a single household around; there was a simple road beside them that stretched into the mountains along the small river. Could it be that the troops would settle down in this bare place? Where would they live?
Guan Yingkui pointed to the surrounding area and said to Zeng Wujun, "Lao Zeng, the headquarters assigned us to settle down here. We have to build a roadbed in the low-lying area as high as a small mountain. Time is very tight. The military region just issued instructions again, asking us to strive to open the road ahead of schedule!"
A loaded truck drove up on the simple road. The driver stopped the car to add water. Ouyang Hai followed Guan Yingkui and Zeng Wujun to the truck.
	"Comrade," Guan Yingkui asked, "What is this car carrying?"
	"Look for yourself!" the driver said irritably.
Guan Yingkui uncovered the tarpaulin on the car and found a pile of large machines with foreign characters lying inside.
	"What?" Ouyang Hai pointed to the pile of machines and asked, "What are you taking them away for? They're...they're useless?"
	"The main things have been removed. What's the use?" The driver was even more angry. "It takes up space in the factory."
Ouyang Hai frowned, and Guan Yingkui and Zeng Wujun did not ask anything more. At this time, they seemed to really understand what had happened. ...

The driver comrade started the car and was about to leave. He poked his head out of the car window and said with a smile:
	"Liberation Army comrades, wait! Before long, I will bring our own machines back!"
	"Worker elder brother, you are right! We will repair the road ahead of schedule and wait for you to transport the new machines," Zeng Wujun said.
Guan Yingkui thought of what the old political commissar said and shouted loudly at the departing car:
	"The sky will not fall!"
The troops immediately started to cut bamboo and cut thatch. In one afternoon, they built simple shacks. While doing this, Ouyang Hai thought of the scene of Squad Leader Zhou and the soldiers of the Fourth Squad building shacks in Laoyawo. At that time, he thought the "heavenly soldiers and generals" were amazing, but now he had also become a "heavenly soldier and general." Work needed it, the revolution needed it. More than ten years had passed, and it seemed that he now understood Zhou Hushan and the soldiers of the Fourth Squad even more deeply than he did back then. Back then, they were for suppressing bandits; today, we are for construction. The goal is the same: to build socialism, to hold high the red flag and carry the revolution through to the end. A song he learned as a child echoed in his mind, and he sang loudly:
	Who am I fighting for, who am I fighting for,
	Who am I shouldering the gun, who am I shouldering the gun? ...
	For the revolution, for the motherland, I am seeking
	Liberation for mankind!
This ordinary People's Liberation Army unit settled down in the barren mountains. They—young workers in military uniforms and the sons and daughters of poor and lower-middle peasants—could only offer their strength and a sincere red heart in the face of this new battle; they could only complete a small section of the railway roadbed. This was too small, too small for the country's self-reliance and overcoming difficulties, and for the grand socialist construction. However, as for this company, they knew how heavy the burden was and how great the difficulties were.
Before the work had even started, difficulties arrived first.
Before laying the roadbed, the thin mud and loose soil in the ditches and fields had to be dug away before stones could be laid. But only a portion of the tools had been delivered, and there were not enough shovels for digging mud to distribute. The quartermaster worried as he looked at a small pile of tools. He told the squad leaders who came to collect tools that each squad only had two shovels and asked everyone to overcome the difficulties and start working first. Ouyang Hai was carrying the last two shovels back when First Squad Leader Liu Weicheng came.
	"Tiger, where do you get the tools?"
	"Tools?" Ouyang Hai knew that there were no more shovels. He said, "Big guy, where did you go to play? You only came now! I was just about to send them to you." As he spoke, he handed his shovel to Liu Weicheng.
	"Then thank you!" Liu Weicheng shouldered the shovel and left.
Ouyang Hai returned to the squad with only two useless pickaxes. He gathered several key members, explained the situation, and studied the method of work. After a while, he brought face basins, rice bowls, and teacups, and the comrades used them to dig in the thin mud. In this way, the speed was slow. Ouyang Hai jumped into the paddy field and used his hands, relying on his ten fingers to dig in the mud. Dig, dig!... These hands that had held dog-beating sticks, had cut firewood, burned charcoal, and held hoes, full of thick calluses and yet young, when the motherland needed them, they took up guns and swung axes; today, when someone delusionally forced us to follow him, these hands did not clasp their hands in prayer, but deeply inserted into the mud, in order to hold high the red flag

    欧阳海之歌
    金敬迈
    编者按：本报今天选载了长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》中的三节。这是一本好小说。它是近年来我国文学工作者进一步革命化、贯彻执行毛泽东文艺路线所取得的新成果之一。这本小说成功地塑造了一个雷锋式的共产主义新人的典型。通过欧阳海这个英雄人物的成长过程，小说生动地展现了我国人民，特别是伟大的中国人民解放军高举毛泽东思想红旗的龙腾虎跃的生活面貌和精神面貌，较深刻地概括了我们时代的千百万革命战士的思想品质和性格特征。
    小说表现了欧阳海在短短二十三年里所走过的英雄道路。这个生长在偏僻山村里的贫农儿子，虽然身受过残酷的阶级压迫，在他的幼小心灵里就播下了自发仇恨的种子，但是，从渴望成为英雄，而不是英雄，到已经成为英雄而不自觉为英雄，却是在党的抚育和培养下，在革命部队的大熔炉中，经受了各种考验和锻炼的成果。它标志着毛泽东思想在培育共产主义新人精神品质方面的伟大胜利。雷锋日记、王杰日记，已经用事实教育着我们，小说中的欧阳海，也将会以他的生动的艺术形象鼓舞我们广大青年向更加革命化的目标迈进一步。
    欧阳海的形象，就是革命人民一不怕苦、二不怕死，一心为革命，一切为革命的英雄典型。他的平凡而又伟大的一生，充分地展示给人们：一个革命战士，应当怎样以正确的态度对待事业、对待理想、对待困难、对待荣誉、对待批评、对待自我改造、对待个人与集体、对待同志间和家庭间的各种关系。这是欧阳海和我们每一个人在成长道路上都会遇到的问题，欧阳海给我们树立了一个光辉的榜样。“响鼓也用重锤敲”
    省里要召开民兵积极分子代表大会，上级指示从三连选派一个好班长去列席会议，并给民兵代表们作刺杀示范表演。支委会正在研究这个问题。多数支委同意欧阳海去：论刺杀技术，他是全连最拔尖的；其它无论战术、射击、投弹、体育各方面，也都是班长当中数一数二的。个别支委的意见是让刘伟城去，论刺杀他虽然不如欧阳海强，可是最近的进步比较大，同时也稳重些。
      “是呵，欧阳海太毛躁了。”一个支委说。“遇事爱提意见，弄得不好就会造成影响。”
      “爱提意见并不能算是缺点嘛！”支部书记曾武军说，“只要是为了帮助领导，改进工作，爱提意见还应该算作对革命负责的优点哩！”
      “那我同意让欧阳海去。”那位支委说。
    曾武军看看大家没什么意见了，站起来说道：
    “我的意见是让刘伟城去。这个同志工作一贯不错，思想方面最近也有很大进步。特别是在骄傲自满这个问题上改正得比较快。至于欧阳海，他的问题我考虑了很久。不错，这是个非常好的同志，但是有些争强好胜。荣誉对他目前来说没有什么好处。”他把最近打猪草的事谈了谈，最后说，“……在他闹着要去西藏的时候，我们要看到他积极的一面；在他做出不少成绩的时候，我们也不能忽略他不足的那一面。哪怕是些细微末节的小事，也不应该放过。特别是现在，当他正在申请入党的时候，为了对一个同志的进步真正负责，那就应该对他要求得更严格一些。”
      “欧阳海已经很不错了！”关英奎说，“遇事想争个第一，而且能争到第一，这就不简单。老实说，我最怕的是那号战士：工作没干好，他也不太在乎，挨了批评，他还是不紧不慢儿的。我看还是让欧阳海去，响鼓不用重锤，给他点两下他就会明白的。要不，会挫伤他的积极性。”
      “积极性也得有个正确的思想基础嘛。你呀，老关！从表面看，你对欧阳海很厉害，动不动就瞪眼珠儿，克。其实，你对他还太娇惯了点。一个战士越是不错，对他的要求就应该越高，这样他才能进步得更快。‘快马不用鞭催，响鼓不用重锤’的说法并不一定恰当。响鼓也用重锤敲敲，那声音不就更大了吗？”
    关英奎笑了：“怎么？我，我对他还不厉害？……”
      “你是当着面厉害，背后就心软。不管在哪次会上，你都很少谈到他的缺点和不足。”
      “你这说的倒也是事实。”关英奎点着头说。
      “我说的只是个人的意见，你们大家再考虑考虑。”曾武军接着讲，“欧阳海凭他淳朴的阶级感情出发，为什么革命这个问题已经基本解决。怎么革命，怎么才能象主席教导的那样做一个纯粹的人，这还要靠他自己努力，靠我们支部多花点心血哩！”
    关英奎想了想，说道：“我是同意老曾的意见的，派刘伟城去列席民兵会议。至于会不会挫伤欧阳海的积极性……”
    曾武军接过来说：“那看我们工作做得怎么样。做好了，不但不会挫伤他的积极性，反而能使他从现有的基础上再大大提高一步。这个工作……”他对一位支委说，“陈永林不在，你们党小组抓紧点，多找他谈谈。”
    那位同志点了点头。支委们都同意了这个意见。
      “那就这样决定了。”关英奎说，“支部正在培养他，这就算是对他的一次具体考验吧！”
    考验来到欧阳海的头上了。
    从关英奎宣布刘伟城去参加民兵大会起，欧阳海就低着头没有吱声。班务会上就这个问题进行讨论的时候，一向发言成套的欧阳海只说了句“大家谈谈吧”，就再也没话说了。……
    大操场上，杀声不断，关英奎正领着刘伟城和另外几个同志在练对刺。刘伟城就要到省里去了。在大会上除了取经以外，还要拿出点真功夫来，这样才能有效地指导民兵们练习刺杀本领，否则还叫什么“示范表演”呢？
    膀大腰圆的刘伟城，穿着满身防护盔甲，威风凛凛地站在那里。几个战士轮番上去，都被他一一刺中。关英奎挥舞着小旗；文娱委员小黄是义务广播员，他扯着嗓门大叫：
    “一比零！”
    “二比零！”
      “三比零！又垮了一个。谁再上？”
      “连长！连长亲自出马！”
    关英奎摆了摆手说：“我不行。”
      “同志们！”一个排长向周围的同志大声喊着，“让连长上！打开原的时候，他一个人捅死了三个敌人。那不是，”他指着关英奎的头说，“他脑袋后边还留着一块‘光荣疤’哩！”
    关英奎红着脸说：“谁告诉你的？那次我差点叫敌人捅死了！亏了咱们……”
    曾武军抢着说：“我证明！他那次确实捅死过敌人，不过不是三个，是三个半——有一个叫他把肠子挑了出来，捂着肚子跑了。”
      “来，呱叽呱叽！”随着排长的话音，场上响起了有节奏的鼓掌声。
      “好吧！”关英奎想，刘伟城左边总有空当，提醒了几次他都改不过来，得让他吃点亏才能引起他的重视。他换好了防护衣帽，对站在一旁的曾武军说：
      “老曾，我怕真的干不过他哩！”说完他平端着枪，拉开了架势，透过防护帽，两只眼睛虎视眈眈地瞅着刘伟城，等待他的进攻。
    刘伟城知道连长的功夫。他原地琢磨了一会儿才猛地一枪刺过去。关英奎早料到他有这一招儿，瞅准了空子，顺手一拨，当的一声，刺中了刘伟城的左前胸。
      “一比零！”小黄喊着。
    观战的同志也跟着叫：“姜还是老的辣！”
      “老将出马，一个顶俩！”
          “……”
    第二回合，关英奎没占着便宜，三几个来回就被刘伟城回敬了一枪。
    “一比一！好一个旗鼓相当。现在就看最后一枪决定胜负了！”小黄说。
    第三枪谁都不轻易出手。眼睛看眼睛、枪尖对枪尖，围着一个不存在的圆心打转转，都想找出对方的破绽再刺，就这样相持了好一会儿。关英奎忽然大喝一声，就象一个炸雷劈了下来，震得地都发颤。刘伟城被这突如其来的情况弄愣了，正在犹豫，关英奎的枪尖又朝左边奔来。他凭着个子大、力气猛，好不容易才躲过了这一枪。可是尽管他左拨右挡，进进退退，仍然摆脱不了被动局面。急中生智，他也怪叫一声，顺势把枪刺了出去。关英奎眼看躲避不及，干脆迎身而上。两个人同时刺中对方。
    掌声、叫好声一直平息不下来。
    小黄反倒急了，他喊着：“这，这可怎么算呀？……干脆，一点五比一点五，和了。”
    关英奎摘下防护帽说：“不，应该算我输了。战场上，我们提倡争取主动去打击敌人。平时的训练中，我们也要鼓励主动进攻的精神。刚才这一枪，是大个子主动，按规定应该判大个子胜。另外，他刺得比我勇，比我猛。他快而不乱，勇中有谋。不过也还是有毛病，只是我还治不了他。告诉你们吧，要是咱们指导员那年不挂花，他才是真正的一把手哩。打开原的时候，他那把刺刀在全师都挂上号了。不是他，我这脖子恐怕早就拧到后边去了！要是他上来嘛，还能跟刘大个拼一阵子。”
      “老关，你出我的洋相干吗！”曾武军说。
      “大个子进步得可真快呀！”有人讲。
      “看来，一时半会儿没有人能治得了他。连连长都输了嘛！”有人附和着。
      “你们先等等，等我去找个能治大个子的人来！”关英奎跑回宿舍，冲着正在屋里看书的欧阳海说：
    “走，跟刘大个子练练对刺去！”
      “我不行。”欧阳海还捧着书本在看。
      “什么态度？刘大个正缺你那两下子，他左边老有空当，得让他吃点亏才能引起重视。快！捅他几枪去。”
      “连长……”
      “噜嗦什么？快来吧！”
    操场上正在议论谁敢再上去拼一拼的时候，一个披挂停当了的战士，跟着关英奎跑来了。他分开众人，站在场子中间；个子虽小，可弓箭步拉得有精有神儿，防护帽紧紧扣在头上，一时还认不出是谁。
    “这是谁呀？”
      “还真有不怕‘死’的！”
      “既然来了，手里必定有‘金刚钻’！”
      “对！山外有山，天外有天嘛！”
    战士们你一言我一语地议论着。
    “准备！”小黄关照刘大个一声，
  “开始！”
    刘伟城象块碑似的竖着，真有一副风吹不倒、雷打不动的气势。正当他选好了有利地形，仔细观察对方弱点的时候，小个子猛不防来了一个“突刺”，出枪是那么迅速、有力！刘伟城中了一枪。
      “咦！……一比零！”
    小黄话音未落，刘伟城端枪冲了上去。小个子原地不动，以逸待劳。他的防左刺和突刺，跟得比机枪的连发还要紧，突突两下，就象同时伸出来两支枪——一个挡，一个刺。刘伟城的左胸脯上又挨了一枪。
      “二，二，二——比零！”小黄的声音都变了个调儿。
    这两枪刺得干净、利索，完全出乎刘伟城的意料。他还没来得及想想自己失利的原因，小个子又冲了上来。他拉开架势，决心和对方决一胜负。哪想到小个子虚晃一枪，不等自己下手，就猛地一拨，只觉得手心一麻，左胸前又是当的一声。
      “三比零！好哇，强中更有强中手，能人之外有能人！”小黄高兴地喊着。
      “卤水点豆腐——一物降一物。”
      “精彩！”小魏也喊着，“这是我见到的最精彩、最最精彩的三枪。”
    关英奎招呼着他们俩说：“来来来！我们研究一下。大个子，刚才这三枪，都刺中你的左边，这说明……”他话没讲完，小个子已经不在了。
    曾武军和同志们一样，被刚才小个子的熟练枪法吸引住了。等他转眼看见小个子跐蹓一下从人缝里钻走了，场子上只剩下刘伟城一个人孤零零地站在那里时，他才想起来：糟！思想工作没跟上。
    欧阳海回到宿舍，刚刚脱下防护衣帽，曾武军就跟着他进来了。
      “欧阳海，你的枪法不错哇！”
      “嘿嘿。”欧阳海笑了一声。不知道他是同意指导员的话还是不同意。
      “可是象你这样的刺法，我们不提倡！”曾武军生气地说，“练习对刺是为了互相学习，共同提高，不是为了比出个谁胜谁负就完。刘伟城是谁？是你的同志，是连里派出去的代表！他代表全连，也代表你欧阳海！他有了不足的地方，我们是赶紧给他指出来，帮助他进步呢，还是象你这样刺完了三枪转身就走？”
      “我……”
    “不错，刘伟城的刺杀技术不如你强。可是对待这样一个还存在某些不足的同志，我们能采取你这样的态度吗？要知道，他这个代表是代表全连、代表部队去做工作，帮助他就是帮助工作，就是帮助了民兵积极分子代表大会。显然你那不服气的想法，妨碍了你这样来认识这个问题。欧阳海，也许我把问题看得严重了一些，我认为透过今天这件事，反映了你对‘代表’的认识还不够正确，你过多地把它看成是一种荣誉了，所以你没有想到应该帮助刘伟城克服他刺杀上的毛病。就算是荣誉，欧阳海，我们一个革命者是从来都不去计较它的。我们要比对党的忠诚，比全心全意为人民服务的思想，我们从来不和自己的同志比荣誉。”
    欧阳海还从来没见指导员这么激动过，也从来没有受过这么严厉的批评。曾武军的这几句话，使他感到问题很严重，但是他一时还理不出个头绪来。
      “……打开原的那次战斗中，咱们的关连长——那时还是个新兵——和另外一个同志缴了一挺重机枪。那时候，缴了重机枪是要立大功的。战斗进行得非常紧张。战斗结束以后，两个人都弄不清那挺重机枪究竟是谁最先缴过来的。领导上要给他们记功，他们俩你推过来，我推过去，谁都不愿要这个功。欧阳海，他们为了什么？为了‘打到南京去，活捉蒋介石’，为了解放全中国！——这对他们来说，比十个‘大功’还重要得多。正是为了这个理想，他们才参军，战斗，负伤，伤口还没好利索又继续冲锋、战斗。我们今天呢，除了台湾省，全国都解放了，进入到社会主义社会了，伟大的共产主义理想在鼓舞着我们，我们应该比当年的新兵站得更高、看得更远才对呵！”
    曾武军见欧阳海把脑袋垂到胸前没有说话，继续讲下去：“上次为打猪草的事我就跟你谈过，让你遇事都好好想想，应该考虑得更全面一些。把本班的工作做好，固然能起到带动全连的作用，热心帮助那些比自己差一点的同志，不更能起到推动工作的作用吗？一个同志，既然决心为共产主义事业奋斗到底，那他的一言一行，一举一动，都应该是在这个崇高的理想指导下进行的，都应该无愧于自己向党所表示的决心。你今天再好好想想：你知道了刘伟城的不足，不给他具体指出来，刺完三枪转身就走了，究竟对不对？怎样做才会对工作更加有利？”
    刚才对刺的时候，欧阳海是刺中了刘伟城三枪。怎么刺中的，刺中了什么地方，他当时的感觉并不具体；而现在指导员对他说的每一句话、每一个字，都象一支支的枪直奔他的心窝而来，使他在痛的同时，也深深意识到：“我是犯了错误，出了问题了！连长说得清清楚楚，让我和刘伟城练练对刺；指导员讲得明明白白，让我干什么都想一想。为什么我刺完了三枪转身就走，为什么我在转身的时候，没有想一想这样做对不对呢？……咳！我真是糊涂呵！工作当中有了一丁点成绩，眼光应该看得更远才对。可是我……”欧阳海紧皱着眉头对自己说，“不要紧，只要我能从现在起，遇事都想一想还来得及！”他慢慢地抬起头来，准备向指导员倾吐自己心中的悔恨。可是指导员不在了。……
    文书站在欧阳海的面前问：
      “指导员呢？刚才不是在跟你谈话吗？”
    欧阳海莫名其妙地点点头：“是呵，刚才是，是在这儿的，可……”
      “咳！这么大把年纪的人，还跟我‘躲猫猫’玩！”文书晃动着手上的一张表格说，“上级要干部们填个表，立功受奖这一栏，指导员就是不肯填。听说连长比较了解，我去问连长，连长说记不清了，起码立过五大功，叫我还是问他自己；我来问指导员，指导员干脆躲着不见面！……”
    欧阳海心里忽的一下，好象全身的血液都加快了速度，心也跳得更紧了。他望着文书手上的那张表格，自言自语地说：“看样子，指导员就是那个战斗英雄，就是那个缴机枪的好同志！人家见着荣誉不肯要，我，我在做些什么蠢事呵！”
    鸡叫第三遍了，欧阳海在床上痛苦得睡不着。他从扳手腕子、打锤、打猪草想到白天刺的那三枪，这一年多来，走的是一条什么样的路呢？入了团，立了功，当了各式各样的标兵，受了不少次嘉奖，自己还以为是在一条英雄的大路上朝前跑着。其实，不仅很多地方是原地踏步，有些地方还在后退呀！……想到这里，欧阳海打了个寒噤。“真怕人哪！毛主席要我们做一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人。我做了些什么呢？……”他觉得对不起周书记，对不起连长、指导员，也对不起刘伟城同志。他从枕头下抽出一本书来，望着封面上抱着炸药包的董存瑞，各种问题又涌上心头：怎么才能当上真正的英雄？什么是真正的英雄？该不该立志当英雄？……这些问题，欧阳海还没有完全弄明白；有一条他明白：要把自己想的一切都告诉党，请求党的批评和帮助。
    欧阳海迫不及待地坐起身来，把纸平铺在膝盖上，借着手电的亮光，满含着羞愧的泪珠，给支部写检讨。敬爱的党支部：
    今天我才发现，我距离一个党员的要求太远太远了。……
    鸡又叫了两遍，曾武军也还没有睡。他在桌前一边翻看欧阳海历次的思想小结，一边在想：一个十九岁的年青战士，要他把问题考虑得那么全面，是不太可能的。有一些争强好胜的思想，也是难免的。何况今天是连长让他去对刺的，他只是没有主动地去帮助刘伟城。这么重的批评，对一个入伍才一年多一点的兵来说，是不是过了？他受不受得了？会不会挫伤他那股“虎”劲和积极性，使他今后失去进取的信心呢？……这些问题，曾武军也还没有完全得出答案来。
    窗外操场上，传来一阵噼噼啪啪的格斗声。曾武军抬头望去：晨光曦微中，有两个黑影在对刺。只见小个儿的黑影不时停下来在讲解什么，接着，又刺了起来。尽管天色还暗，看不清是谁，但是曾武军从那一大一小熟悉的身影上感觉到，自己苦恼了一夜的问题，已经基本解决了。
      “哟！天都亮了！”曾武军熄了灯，站起身来。他望着操场上那两个对刺的身影，心里头有股说不出来的舒坦劲：一个政治工作者，最首要的责任，莫过于正确地贯彻党的方针、政策，使党的意图在工作中得到体现；最大的愉快，也莫过于看见了同志们在党的指引下，不断进步，大步向前。他慢慢地踱到窗前，迎着一阵带潮味的晨风，深情地望着那个虎里虎气的小个子，望着望着，他情不自禁地说：
      “真是个自觉的好战士呵！”
      （选自第四章《前进的路上》）扬　帆　远　航
    大雨连续泼了两天多才勉强收住，但头上仍然是乌云盖顶，看不到一丝儿蓝天。
    部队趟过了一条小河，正沿着公路行进。几天来，在大雨和泥泞中急行军，已经使同志们疲惫不堪。肠炎带来的腹泻，消耗了欧阳海的体力，他觉得一步比一步艰难了。前方，一匹枣红色的战马，迎面飞奔而来，骑兵通信员传来指挥部的指示：连长们到前边去开会，部队原地休息待命。
    同志们不管路边是泥是水，就近找一块地方坐了下去。欧阳海屁股还没沾地，就忙着了解全班同志的情况。有的同志背包完全湿透了，四十斤重的行装，现在足有六十来斤；更多的同志成了“泡”兵。魏武跃见班长朝自己走来，连忙把打满了血泡的双脚，藏到雨衣里边去。
    欧阳海已经看见小魏这笨手笨脚的掩饰，走上前说：
    “小魏，够呛吧！”
      “我没啥！参军一年多来，我觉得最轻松、最最轻松的行军就数这一次。你还是多关心点同志们吧。”小魏的脸上，强装出一副不自然的笑容。
    欧阳海心里暖烘烘的，他被小魏这极其平凡的表现所感动。多快呵，前些时，他一会儿喜欢看小人书，一会儿喜欢下军棋，是个完全凭兴趣办事的小鬼，现在，也懂得了要克服自身的困难，适应革命的需要，为集体分忧了。脚上打了泡还要继续行军，这本是部队的传统。但是在小魏身上表现出来，却使欧阳海深深感觉到，在这次困难面前，人人都想拿出最大的力量，来分担国家的重担，谁都是用战斗的姿态，来迎接这次紧急任务的！他不声不响地走过去，把小魏的米袋子抓过来扛在自己的肩上。能为战友们减轻一两负担，作为班长，心里也是舒坦的。路还要往前走哩。
      “你说，”高翼中翘起自己的脚板，问身旁的小魏，“脚为什么会打泡？”
      “长途行军，最忌讳、最最忌讳的就是穿新鞋。咱们俩犯了忌讳，那还有不打泡的？”小魏说，“这全怪我们的准备工作没做好，事先考虑得不周到。”
      “不。”高翼中俏皮地说，“新鞋旧鞋那是次要的；主要是由于脚板和地球磨擦的次数太多了，超过了它力所能及的限度，这才使得皮和肉分了家——皮肉之间的空隙，我们把它叫做‘泡’。”
    小魏笑着说：“嗬！到底是高中生，说起话来都曲里拐弯儿的。”
      “这是科学。干什么都有一定的限度：吃饭吧，一次只能吃六合——零点一三二加仑。这是胃里最大的容量。走路吧，一次也不能走得太远。超过了限度，违反了科学，就会带来痛苦。”
    “小高，我不同意你的说法。你的这门‘科学’对我们也不适用。”欧阳海走上前说，“按你这么讲，那长征也不科学了？红军过草地的时候，上哪儿去找‘六合’米来吃？可是他们吃了野菜、草根，甚至吃皮带，还照样打胜仗！老红军战士，哪个脚上没有血泡？可是他们踩着血泡，照样走完了两万五千里！”
      “这……这……”小高没词儿了。
    欧阳海接着说：“只要是斗争需要，别说是脚上打了几个泡，就是两条腿打断了，也要往前爬。这也是一门科学——革命的科学。老红军凭着这门科学打胜仗，我们今天，还要凭着这门科学打胜仗！”
      “对！我‘投降’了。班长说的这个科学，好象比我那‘科学’还要科学些。”高翼中的这几句话，把大家都逗笑了。
    欧阳海从挎包里拿出一小块肥皂，递给高翼中说：
      “你快抓紧时间把鞋里的沙子抖一抖，袜底，鞋边上打点肥皂。这虽然不怎么‘科学’，可是能起作用。要不你又该怪什么和地球磨擦的次数太多呀、皮肉分了家呀……怪来怪去没有用。”他说完自己也笑了起来。……
    前方传来了继续前进的号音，同志们唰的一下站起来，准备再往前走。关英奎从前边赶了回来，他一面挥手，拦住大家，一面喊：
      “同志们，我们已经到了，这里就是我们的目的地。”
    “到了？”同志们都感到诧异。这时才想起来看看周围的环境：两山之间的一块洼地，前无村后无店，四周连一户人家也没有；身边有一条简便公路，沿着小河伸向山里去。部队难道就在这个光秃秃的地方扎下来？住在哪里呢？
    关英奎指了指周围，对曾武军说：“老曾，指挥部分配我们就在这里扎下来，要在洼地上垒起一道和小山一样高的路基。时间紧得很，军区刚又来了指示，要我们一定争取提前通车！”
    简便公路上，一辆载重汽车驶了过来。司机停下车来加水。欧阳海跟着关英奎和曾武军朝汽车走去。
      “同志，”关英奎问，“这车上拉的是什么？”
      “你自己看嘛！”司机没好气地说。
    关英奎揭开车上的雨布，发现里边躺着一堆刻着外国字的大机器。
      “怎么？”欧阳海指着那堆机器问，“拉走干什么？没……没用了？”
      “主要的玩意都撤走了，还有啥用？”司机的火更大了，“放在厂里还占地方哩。”
    欧阳海紧皱着眉头，关英奎和曾武军也都没有再问什么。这时，他们似乎真的明白发生了什么事了。……
    司机同志起车要走，从车窗里探出头来笑着说：
      “解放军同志，等着吧！要不了多久，我会把咱们自己出的机器拉回来的！”
      “工人老大哥，你说得对呀！咱们提前把路修好，等着你们把新机器运来。”曾武军说。
    关英奎想起了老政委的话，冲着远去的汽车大声喊着：
      “天是塌不下来的！”
    部队立即动手砍竹子，割茅草，一个下午就把简单的窝棚搭好了。欧阳海一边干，一边想起周排长他们在老鸦窝搭草棚的情景来。那时候觉得“天兵天将”真了不起，现在自己也成了“天兵天将”。工作需要，革命需要嘛。十多年过去了，好象现在才更深刻地理解了当年的周虎山和四班的战士们。如今自己也是个四班长了，老鸦窝的劳动场景又浮现在眼前。当年，他们为了剿匪；今天，我们为了建设，目的都是一个：要建成社会主义，要高举红旗把革命进行到底。一首儿时学会的歌子在脑子里萦回着，他大声地唱了起来：
    我为谁来打仗，为谁来打仗，
    我为谁扛起枪，为谁扛起枪？……
    为革命，为祖国，我为人类求
    解放！
    这支普普通通的解放军部队，在荒山野地里扎下来了。他们——穿上军装的青年工人和贫、下中农的子弟，在这场新的战斗面前，能拿出来的，只是自己那把力气和一颗赤诚的红心；能完成的，也不过是一小段铁路路基。这对全国自力更生、战胜困难来说，这对宏伟的社会主义建设来说，是太微小太微小了。可是，对这个连队说来，他们知道担子有多么重，困难有多么大。
    工作还没开始，困难就先到了。
    垫路基以前，要把沟里、田里的稀泥松土挖走，然后才能铺上石头。可是只运到了一部分工具，挖泥用的铁锹不够分配。司务长望着一小堆工具发愁。他对前来领工具的班长们说，每班只有两把锹，叫大家克服困难先干着。欧阳海扛起最后两把锹往回走的时候，一班长刘伟城才赶来。
      “属虎的，在哪儿领工具？”
      “工具？”欧阳海知道铁锹已经没有了，说，“大个子，你跑哪儿玩去了，这时候才来！我正准备给你送去哩。”说着，把自己的铁锹递给了刘伟城。
      “那就谢谢啦！”刘伟城扛起铁锹就走了。
    欧阳海只拿着两把使不上劲的十字镐回到班里来。他把几个骨干分子找来，交代了情况，研究了干法。过会儿，拿来了脸盆，饭钵，茶缸子，同志们就用它在稀泥里挖着。这样，速度慢。欧阳海一下跳到水田里，用自己的双手，靠那十个手指头在泥里刨起来。刨呀，刨呀！……这双拿过打狗棍的手，这双砍过柴，烧过炭，握过锄头把子，长满了厚茧而又年青的手呵，在祖国需要的时候，它握起枪杆，抡起斧头；今天，当有人妄想逼着我们跟他走，这双手没有合十作揖，而是深深地插到泥里边来，为了高举无产阶级的革命红旗，它一把土，一捧水地劳动着！指甲缝里塞满了淤泥，手都泡肿了，他还在坚持着。就这样一捧又一捧，一盆又一盆，一担又一担地挖走了一层泥，戽干了一片水。论方式，当然落后一些，论思想，却是人类最崇高、最先进的。因为这是为了坚持真理，为了革命而劳动。那些十指尖尖、听着电子音乐、跳摇摆舞的青年人，怎能和这一代风流人物相比！有人把安逸、享受当成幸福，为了活命，竟能够认敌为友，出卖无产阶级的利益；有人认为，幸福就是劳动和斗争，宁愿自己多吃点苦，也要为天下受苦人战斗终身。
      “高举革命红旗，干哪！”欧阳海的这声呼喊，变成了全工地的口号。四班在喊着，全连在喊着，整个工地都在喊着：
      “高举革命红旗，干哪！”
    刘伟城到四班的工地上取经来了。他发现欧阳海正用两只手在泥里刨着，再一看，整个四班连一把铁锹也没有。他这才明白过来，忙把欧阳海拉到一边。
      “属虎的，你，你这是干什么？”刘伟城指着欧阳海沾满稀泥的双手说。
      “没，没干什么呀！”
    “拿着吧！”刘伟城把手里的铁锹塞到他手上，“四班长，我们两个班可是挑了战的。这样，我们就算是比赢了，心里也不好受呀！”
      “大个子，我对你真有意见了。你想到哪儿去了？”欧阳海生气地把铁锹又扔回给刘伟城，“反正都一样，我们班不用手刨，你们班也得用手来刨，关键的关键是工具不够嘛。听司务长说，过两天，大批的工具就运来了。”
      “对，对，对呀！……”刘伟城激动得一个劲儿地点头。他紧紧握着欧阳海的双手，半天没有放开。这两双手，从扳手腕子起，经过了扛木头、打锤、刺杀，还从来没有这样紧紧地、亲密地握在一起过。眼前的形势，使得这两个战友都明白了自己过去的不足，更深地懂得了为什么要开展竞赛、比武、评比、挑战；为什么既是“对手”，又应该肩并肩、手拉手地共同战斗。因为我们重任在肩，目标一致；因为我们要自力更生地建设出个样子来，长一长世界革命人民的志气！
    天擦黑的时候部队才收工。小魏跑来报告说，发现有一小段路基下面的稀泥还没清除干净。
    欧阳海问：“是谁干的？”
      “小高。他没有干过这种活儿，又为了抢时间……”小魏撅着嘴巴嘟囔着说。
    高翼中低着脑袋没吭气。
    欧阳海说：“小高，这可不行！‘百年大计，质量第一’嘛。”
      “那怎么办呢？”有个战士问。
    欧阳海斩钉截铁地说：“返工，重新干！”
      “来不及了，要返工也明天再干吧！”
    欧阳海看看天色，是晚了。他说：“我先去连里汇报一下。”
    那个战士拉住欧阳海小声说：
  “班长！工程进度刚刚统计过了，晚上要评比呢！明天，明天我们抽个休息时间，悄悄补上算了。”
      “你说呢，小高？”欧阳海问道。
      “我说……我说还是去汇报吧。”小高低着头说，“都怪我！我想头两天嘛，总得争个第一，以为留点稀泥没大关系。这种认识本身就，就不科学。”
      “对。我们是在建设社会主义，忽视工程质量的事我们不能干。更重要的是这种思想要不得！”欧阳海在劝说大家，实际上也是批评自己。
    欧阳海饭也没顾得吃，急忙来到连部，向连长、指导员详详细细地汇报了。最后说：
      “明天我们一定利用休息时间返工，把这一段补上。”
    关英奎指着统计表问：“那今天的评比怎么评呢？”
      “给我们的进度画个‘零’，给我们四班评个最‘下游’。这样，既教育了我们，又警惕了大家。”
      “刘伟城他们完成了三十多立方。你们一班、四班是挑了战的呵！”曾武军笑着说。
      “指导员，这个事我们已经想过了。该是什么是什么，干革命工作要老老实实，实事求是，不能为了图虚名。大个子他们记三十立方是应该的；我们记半个立方，心里也觉得对不起社会主义。”
    看见欧阳海那严肃认真的样子，曾武军摸着胡茬子心满意足地笑了。看样子，欧阳海已经不再把个人、小单位的荣誉放在心上，大踏步地跑到正道上来了。这个小战士呵！从里到外通明透亮，变得更加纯粹了。这是一个新的起点。正象一只小船，几经曲折，冲出滩多水急的峡谷，来到宽阔的大海上。现在，他可以扬帆远航了。……
        （选自第五章《骨硬心红》）南　岳　枫　红
    欧阳海在睡梦中不时被远处隆隆的火车声惊醒。他觉得火车的声音仿佛一夜都没断过，每隔几十分钟就开过去一趟，每过一趟他就被强烈的震动唤醒。汽笛鸣叫着，又有一列火车开进了附近的车站，车头粗声粗气地喘息着，好象在积蓄力量准备再次飞奔。欧阳海抬头看了看窗外，天空还是漆黑一片，屋檐下还滴滴答答地掉着雨点。可是他怎么也睡不着了，短短的一觉，似乎已经赶走了多少天来的疲倦。他独自爬起身来，点燃了桌上的小油灯，从怀里掏出一个小日记本，俯在桌上写起来：
      一九六三年十一月十八日雨
        野营合练途中，七班
    接受营的后卫警戒和收容
    组任务……
    刚刚写了一句他就停下笔来。“今天已经十八号了！？”想着，他翻了翻前两天的日记。等证实今天确实是十八号了，他不觉暗暗吃了一惊，望着摇曳不定的灯苗，轻轻地说：“真快呀，已经十一月十八了！再过几天，我就满二十三岁了。……我还什么都不会，什么都没做哩，就过了二十三年，长成个大人了！”他想起在老鸦窝的时候，刚过十岁就想当“天兵天将”，周虎山不肯要，说自己年纪太小。“那时候，”他心里说，“那时候多么盼着快点长大呵！记得自己常常到门前的那棵松树旁边去比比高矮，用柴刀在树上刻下记号。哪晓得过了些日子不但没长，好象反倒矮了一截。妈妈说自己是个‘苕伢子’，说你长它也长，你还有树长得快？”是呵，那时候就是想长得比松树还快些——长大了好当兵呵！可是现在……欧阳海打量着自己一身洗得发白了的军衣，现在又觉得自己长得太快了，一晃就过了二十三年，从小就盼着的当兵生活，眼看就要结束了，等待着自己的是一场新的战斗，一副更重的担子。国防工厂在哪儿，是干什么的，“军事秘密”会不会是制造……这些新的问题都在他脑子里盘旋着。去工厂是首长指名挑的，自己能不能用实际行动来回答首长的期望呢？欧阳海深深觉得自己进步得太慢，学的东西太少。世界上有那么多的工作需要共产党员去完成，而自己却什么都不懂！毛主席他老人家那么忙还在学外文，自己哪怕从此不睡觉，也会觉得时间不够用的，而自己偏偏把这二十三度春秋轻易地放过去了……
      “这二十三年就算它过去了，”欧阳海对自己说，油灯在他深邃的眼睛里映出两朵发光的火苗。他提高了声音，“下二十三年、从今往后，我可要多做工作，努力学习，为社会主义建设挑起双担来！”
    窗外透进来一线灰白色。欧阳海犹豫了一下，还是把同志们叫醒了。全班开了一个简短的小会。会上，他传达了警戒收容的任务，研究了分工和注意事项；大家也纷纷表示了决心，人人都对完成全营的后卫警戒和收容任务充满信心。他们打好了背包，整理好房子，外边才传来起床号声。
    天已经大亮了，细雨还在不停地下着。湘江流水翻滚着白浪，云雾缭绕着巍峨的南岳衡山，祝融峰隐藏在一片白茫茫的雾霭中。一阵风起，满山的枫叶颤抖着。看样子，一场大风大雨就要到来了……
    部队踏着泥泞，按照行军的序列向东奔去。他们将横跨铁路，奔向野营合练的最后一个演习场地。指导员率领三连出发了，薛新文从行列中跑了出来，向站在一旁的欧阳海嘱咐道：“欧阳海，我们先走了。后卫警戒、收容任务，都交给七班、交给你了！”
      “副指导员，你放心！保证完成任务！”欧阳海象喷出一堆铁块，字字千钧地回答着。
    部队成单行前进。七班目送着副指导员赶上了连队。高翼中计算了一下时间，估计警戒班一时还走不了，对欧阳海说：“班长，我们抓紧时间去检查一下群众纪律，看看借老乡的东西是不是都还了，有没有损坏了没赔偿的。”
      “这也是后卫警戒的任务吗？”一个战士问。
      “当然这不算警戒班的任务，”高翼中说，“可这也是革命工作嘛，我们既然想到了，就应该主动多做一些。”
    欧阳海和魏武跃都没有说话。他们满意地望着小高，觉得完全可以放心大胆地离开七班、离开连队去到新的岗位上。有这样的好战士，一旦挑起班长的担子，会把一个班带得更棒、更出色的！
    七班挨家挨户问的结果，得到的是一片感谢声：感谢同志们挑水、打柴，感谢大军把房前房后都打扫得干干净净。一个系着红领巾的少先队员，背着书包从一间屋里追了出来，他喊着：“叔叔，你们要走了？”
      “是呵，再见了，小兄弟！”欧阳海回答说，“我们有任务，练好了兵去打反动派。”
    “那……什么时候再给我们讲故事呵？”
      “等我们回来的时候吧。我一定给你讲一个新的故事。”欧阳海向小孩招招手，领着七班，跑在炮连的后边，踏上了征途。
    部队急速朝前移动着。前边不远是一道两山之间的峡谷，两条铮亮的铁轨从峡谷中伸展出来。山顶上，有一座白塔屹立在风雨中。
    长长的行军行列朝白塔下面的峡谷奔去，他们将从这儿横跨铁路，奔赴路东。
    欧阳海甩开大步走在全班的最前面。他不时回头望望巍峨耸立的衡山，心里想：“要是晴天就好了，可以看见祝融峰顶和满山的红枫，还可以看见山上一排排新修的工人疗养院大楼哩！”
    刘延生望着前方的路基引起了一个话题：再过几十年铁路会变成什么样，火车还要不要人来开。大家七嘴八舌地发表自己的见解：有的说当然要用人开；有的讲那时候一切都靠自动化操纵。
      “那时候一切都不用人了，人活着干什么？”刘延生不解地问道。
      “你别担这份儿心，”一个战士回答说，“等一切都是自动化以后，人就坐在屋里享福嘛。譬如想吃饭了，一按电钮，肚子就饱了。”
      “不会吧！”欧阳海插嘴道，“人活着嘛，总是为了劳动。一天到晚光享福那有什么意思？”
      “我不同意班长的意见。”那个战士说，“衡山上有好多工人疗养院，那是用来干什么的？还不是为了工人老大哥劳动完了之后，住进去疗养疗养，享享福！”
      “不！”小刘争辩着，“工人疗养院是为了让工人老大哥疗养好身体，以便更好地劳动。”
      “对，小刘说得对！”欧阳海说，
  “劳动不是为了住疗养院，劳动是为了创造世界。譬如我们平素干完了一件工作，完成了一次任务之后，心里总有一股特别的舒服劲。这股劲儿就是劳动换来的。不管享什么福，不管吃什么好的、穿什么好的，都代替不了劳动之后的这股劲。学习毛主席著作时有了新的体会，射击打了优秀，投弹达到五十米，野营中练出了一身保卫祖国的过硬本领，我们就恨不得高兴地唱起来才好；要是光让你享福，你能唱出个什么调调来？我呀，要是不让我干活儿，不让我工作，哪怕让我活上一百八十岁我也不干。活着也是个废物嘛！……”
      “对！我同意班长的意见。”刘延生说，“这就是那人生观问题！”
    云层越来越低，雨也越下越大。雨点敲打着路边的树叶和崖壁上的杂草，激起一片沙沙声。雨、雾使得远处近处都是白茫茫的一片。
    先头部队已经穿过铁路以东了；走在最后的炮兵分队和担任警戒收容任务的七班，正走在象刀切开似的两山峡谷之中。前边是个急转弯，远处传来了火车的汽笛声。
      “停止前进！火车来了，注意安全。”前边一句接一句地传来了口令声。
      “停止前进！火车来了，注意安全。”欧阳海大声地向后重复着，让同志们紧紧贴着崖壁站稳。
    弓背形的铁轨隐没在四五十米外的一座山背后，大家什么都看不见。听声音，火车越来越近了。
    一列客车，满载着上千名奔赴各个建设岗位的旅客，从南往北，风驰电掣地朝峡谷驰来。司机发现路边的部队，急忙降低了行车的速度。
    火车鸣着长长的汽笛朝峡谷冲来。霎时间，汽笛声、高昂的排气声、车轮的震动声在两山之间激荡着，构成了震耳欲聋的共鸣。树枝在风雨中飘摇，杂草紧贴着地皮乱晃，整个大地都随着颤动起来。
    飞奔而来的火车从山后一露头，距离欧阳海他们就只有四五十米远了。弧形的铁轨造成了人们的错觉，就好象火车不是沿着铁路，而是迎着路边的战士，铺天盖地地冲将过来……
    突然，一声令人颤栗的马嘶声在身边响起：炮兵分队最后边那匹驮炮的战马受惊了。它挣断了缰绳朝轨道上奔去！它驮着压不烂的钢炮横在铁轨中间！它惊惶万状地在车头的前方打转！它忽然又象用钉子钉在那里，死也不肯动了！
    事情发生得这么突然。欧阳海透过蒙蒙细雨把这一切都看在眼里。他浑身的血液在沸腾！他两道黑眉倒立起来！他整个心都象要从胸腔里跳出来！……要知道，按照列车的速度，四秒钟内，车头就将与战马相撞。老工人叙述的惨剧就在眼前，马死车翻，眼看是无法避免了……
    时间不容任何人考虑，四秒钟不容任何人犹豫。这真是关键的关键哪！就在这个时候，欧阳海，他象支离弦的箭，他象颗出膛的炮弹，冲着车头、朝着战马、迎着危险飞奔而去……
    四秒钟，这是多么短暂的一霎那！战马呵，你赶快离开；列车呵，你赶快刹住；时间呵，你停一停！我们的欧阳海冲上来啦！……
    可是战马没有动，时间在一秒一秒地消逝，巨大的车头、长长的列车，正以雷霆万钧之势，劈头盖顶地朝着战马、朝着我们的欧阳海，压了过来、压了过来、压过来了！
    ……这四秒钟内，欧阳海都想了些什么？
    短短的四秒钟里，也许他想起了他二十三年的一生：一个从雪里边捡回来的穷孩子，连个正名都不敢起，饥饿、寒冷就是他的童年，讨米篮、打狗棍常在他的手边，连梦里都提防着刘家大屋的黄狗呵；……是共产党从风雪中把他救了出来，是毛主席拨亮了他的眼睛，使他懂得了，人为什么才受苦，人活着应该怎样去斗争；他从一个讨米伢子变成中国共产党党员；他过去只为填饱四妹子的饥肠而挨门乞讨，如今他明白了要为天下受苦人战斗到明天。……眼前，列车上是上千个自己的同志和社会主义财产，路边是自己亲密的战友和武器、弹药。集体利益和个人生命无法并存地摆在他的面前，欧阳海，他还有什么可犹豫的哩！
    在这短短的四秒钟内，欧阳海都看见了些什么？
    迎着扑将过来的列车，也许他看见了一条英雄的大路：瞧！董存瑞在大路上走着，他左手托起炸药包，右手拉响了导火索，坚定地站在“桥型碉堡”下边。看！黄继光在大路上走着，他飞快地扑向敌人的机枪掩体，回过头来，眼睛望着冲锋的战友和胜利的红旗。看！张思德在大路上走着，他正挑着一担刚刚出窑的木炭，从安塞的山里边笑呵呵地走下山来。江姐也在大路上走着，她还穿着那件红色的绒线衣，步伐是那样坚定有力、泰然自若……无数的人民英雄在欧阳海眼前出现了！有的为新中国举起了炸药包，有的为中朝人民用胸膛堵住枪口，有的为了人民的解放事业，勤勤恳恳为人民服务到最后一息，有的为了实现人类崇高的理想，含着笑容走上刑场……大路上的英雄们用生命抚育着欧阳海。面对飞奔而来的火车，欧阳海还有什么可选择的哩！
    在这短短的四秒钟内，欧阳海都听到了些什么呢？
    隆隆的火车声中，他也许听到了毛主席的教诲。十多年来党的培养、教育，五年来部队首长的谆谆告诫，亲人的嘱托，英雄们的誓言，都在他耳边回响起来了：听！
  “为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。”这是毛主席浑厚有力的声音；听！“为了新中国，冲呵！”这是董存瑞用生命喊出的最强音；听！江姐异常平静地在说：“如果需要我们为共产主义理想而牺牲，我们每一个人都应该，也可以做到——脸不变色、心不跳。”曾武军在讲：“活着，为了党的事业战斗；死，为了党的事业献身，无产阶级的解放事业需要千千万万个这样的人。”妈妈在说：“三三，你这是去办大事，闹革命呵！”……领袖的亲切教导，和这些无产阶级的豪言壮语、人民英雄的铿锵誓言，平时就深深地激动着欧阳海；现在，当社会主义财产即将损毁，当上千名阶级兄弟的生命面临死亡的时刻，欧阳海还有什么可畏惧的哩！
    在这短短的四秒钟内，欧阳海都说了些什么？
    也许他正喊着参军时的誓言：“董存瑞，我的好兄弟，欧阳海已经踏着你的脚步跟上来了！”也许在要求着：“连长，叛匪在杀人，我受不了，我要为西藏人民报仇去！”也许在说：“高举革命红旗，干哪！”听！他用生命在呼喊：“同志们，欧阳海肩上的担子托付给你们了！”……除此之外，面对着祖国和敬爱的党，面对人民和战友，欧阳海不需要再说什么了！
    在这短短的四秒钟内，也许他什么也没有说，什么也没有想；也许他什么也没有看见，什么也没有听到。但是，有一个信念在推动着他：决不能让人民的生命财产遭受损失！为共产主义理想献身的时刻到了！共产党员应该冲上前去！
    欧阳海冲上了铁路！欧阳海抢在车头到达之前，拼尽全力推开了战马！欧阳海使满载旅客的列车免遭颠覆！旅客的生命得救了，路边的战友们得救了，国家的财产得救了，无法避免的惨剧避免了；可是，共产党员欧阳海却被巨大的火车卷进车轮底下，倒在血泊中……
      “班长呵！……”同志们带着令人心碎的呼喊声奔上前去。峡谷里回响着一片哀痛，湘江的流水，四周的群山，悲切地呼应着：
      “欧阳海呵！……”
    在欧阳海跃上铁路之前，司机已经撩过了紧急制动闸，巨大的惯性力，推着列车向前滑行了两百来米才停住。司机向欧阳海跑来，旅客们向欧阳海跑来，薛新文从队伍的最前面赶了回来。
    欧阳海躺在同志们的臂腕中。他安详地睁着那双深邃明亮的眼睛，望着安然无恙的列车，望着陌生的旅客们，望着滚滚北流的湘江，望着细雨蒙蒙的天空。远处是巍峨雄伟的祝融峰，近处是傲然屹立的白塔。……
    刘延生从欧阳海的衣兜里掏出了一本《毛泽东著作选读》和一个被鲜血染红了的笔记本。笔记本第一页上清晰地写着：
    即使有一天，这个世界上没有了我，我也仍然衷心地相信：共产主义的理想必然胜利，一定会有更多更多觉醒了的人为它战斗！
        （选自第十章《脸不变色心不
  跳》）
    我是毛泽东时代的青年，我的一切都象钢铁一样——我的头脑，我的胸怀，我的意志……
    谁在生活的激流中，不敢扬起风帆，他的生命的船，就会搁浅在时代的岸边！
    懦夫虽有双腿，却畏惧低矮的山梁，勇士虽无翅膀，也敢凌空翱翔。
    暴风雨无情的袭击，把嫩草娇花打倒在泥里，它却把巍然屹立的山岩，冲洗得更加壮丽。
    人民革命的胜利是要千百万人的牺牲去换取的，为了胜利而承担这种牺牲，是我们共产党人最大的骄傲和愉快。
    不管是狂风暴雨，不管是惊涛骇浪，一定要把战斗的旗帜，指向共产主义！
    即使有一天这个世界上没有了我，我也仍然衷心地相信，共产主义的真理必然胜利，一定会有更多更多觉醒了的人，为它战斗！
    伟大出于平凡，只有珍惜平凡的人，才有无比的贡献，才有成为伟大的可能。
    如果需要为共产主义的理想而牺牲，我们每一个人都应该，也可以做到——脸不变色，心不跳！
    当我临终之时，我将无愧地对世人宣称：我的一生，都献给了壮丽的共产主义事业。
    ……无产阶级要解放自己，就必须解放全人类……。
