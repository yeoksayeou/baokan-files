    China's Largest Sewage Irrigation Project
    Shenfu Sewage Irrigation Canal Completed

    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) China's largest sewage irrigation project, the Shen (Yang) Fu (Shun) Sewage Irrigation Canal, has been fully completed and officially put into use on January 18.
    This sewage irrigation canal stretches seventy-one kilometers from the Xinfu District of Fushun in the east to the Sujiatun District of Shenyang in the west. It will mainly be used to discharge industrial and domestic sewage from Fushun City. After treatment, this sewage can be used to irrigate farmland in the suburbs of Fushun and Shenyang.
    Sewage from industrial cities contains large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other fertilizers needed by crops. Using sewage to irrigate farmland can not only promote increased agricultural production, but also prevent rivers from being polluted, which is conducive to improving urban environmental sanitation. Lishizhai Commune in the suburbs of Fushun City is one of the earliest communes to use urban sewage to irrigate rice paddies. Their production practice proves that using sewage for irrigation, as long as the amount of irrigation and the growth relationship of crops are properly controlled, can both promote early maturity and full grains of rice, and kill pests and eliminate weeds, achieving continuous years of increased production. In the past, this commune only produced two to three hundred jin of rice per mu, but now it has increased to seven to eight hundred jin.
    Relevant leading organs of Liaoning Province began to build the Shenfu Sewage Irrigation Canal in 1960. They adopted the principle of building and utilizing simultaneously. By last year, the area irrigated with sewage had expanded from more than 800 mu to more than 100,000 mu. The yields of these farmlands are generally 50% to 100% higher than before sewage irrigation.
    The communes and teams along the canal have also self-reliantly built many small-scale water conservancy projects, creating conditions for further expanding the area of sewage irrigation.

### 我国最大的一项污水灌溉工程  沈抚污水灌渠全线竣工

    我国最大的一项污水灌溉工程
    沈抚污水灌渠全线竣工
    据新华社沈阳电　我国最大的一项污水灌溉工程——沈（阳）抚（顺）污水灌渠已经全线竣工，并在一月十八日正式交付使用。
    这条污水灌渠，东起抚顺新抚区，西至沈阳苏家屯区，全长七十一公里。它将主要用来排出抚顺市的工业污水和生活污水。这些污水经过处理后，就可以用来灌溉抚顺和沈阳两市郊区的农田。
    工业城市的污水含有大量的氮、磷、钾等农作物需要的肥分。用污水灌溉农田，既可促进农业增产，又可使江河不受污染，有利于改善城市的环境卫生。抚顺市郊区李石寨公社是最早利用城市污水灌溉稻田的公社之一。他们的生产实践证明，使用污水灌田，只要掌握好灌溉量和作物的生长关系，就既能促进水稻早熟和籽粒饱满，又能杀伤害虫、消灭杂草，达到连年增产。这个公社过去每亩水稻只产二三百斤，现在增加到七八百斤。
    辽宁省有关领导机关从一九六○年起，就开始兴建沈抚污水灌渠。他们采取边建设边利用的方针，到去年引污水灌田的面积已由八百多亩扩大到十万多亩。这些农田一般产量都比没有用污水灌溉以前增产百分之五十到一倍以上。
    灌渠沿线的社队还自力更生地兴建了很多小型水利工程，为进一步扩大污水灌溉面积创造了条件。
