    Clarifying the Truth About Sino-Cuban Trade Issues
    What Prime Minister Castro discussed at the mass rally in Havana regarding the decline in China's exports to Cuba in 1966 to a level lower than any trade year from 1961 to 1965, the so-called long-term supply of 250,000 tons of rice from China in exchange for sugar with specific ratio, and the so-called refusal of China to discuss Cuba using economic loans to offset its trade deficit with China, are all inconsistent with the facts. On the eve of the Tricontinental Conference, Prime Minister Castro's sudden and unusually unilateral, untrue disclosure of the preliminary trade negotiations underway between the two sides is something we cannot help but regret. We believe the Cuban people can fully understand the position of the Chinese people, and the profound friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples will surely be strengthened.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 9th. On January 2nd, in Prime Minister Fidel Castro's speech at the mass rally in Havana celebrating the seventh anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, he spoke at length about Sino-Cuban trade issues. In order to clarify the truth, our reporter specifically interviewed the responsible person of the Ministry of Foreign Trade to discuss the relevant issues. The questions and answers are as follows:
    Question: Prime Minister Castro mentioned in his speech at the January 2nd mass rally that the trade volume between China and Cuba in 1966 decreased compared to 1965, and that China's exports to Cuba decreased to a level "lower than any trade year from 1961 to 1965." Can you introduce the situation of Sino-Cuban trade negotiations in 1966?
    Answer: A delegation from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade, led by Comrade Ismael Bello, Director of the Asian Socialist Countries Department of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade, came to Beijing on November 10, 1965, to conduct preliminary negotiations with the corresponding delegation from our Ministry of Foreign Trade regarding trade between the two countries in 1966. This negotiation is still in progress.
    According to the report of our Ministry's delegation, the preliminary trade volume between China and Cuba in 1966, as discussed by the two delegations, is somewhat lower than in 1965, but still higher than in 1962 and 1963, and equivalent to the level of 1964. Prime Minister Castro's statement that China's exports to Cuba decreased to a level "lower than any trade year from 1961 to 1965" is inconsistent with the facts. Each country arranges its foreign trade according to its economic situation at the time. Therefore, in international trade, trade volumes sometimes fluctuate. This has been the case for Sino-Cuban trade in recent years, with volumes being higher in 1961, lower in 1962 and 1963, higher in 1964, and higher again in 1965. If there is a decrease in 1966, this is completely normal.
    Socialist countries support each other in trade while also exchanging goods based on their respective needs and possibilities. It is common for one party to be unable to meet the needs of the other in trade relations between two countries. This situation has occurred in Sino-Cuban trade negotiations in the past few years, and it has also been encountered in this negotiation. We have some commodities that did not meet Cuba's demands, and similarly, Cuba has some commodities that did not meet our demands. In this negotiation, the Cuban side requested that we supply Cuba with 285,400 tons of rice in 1966, which is more than double the amount we generally supplied Cuba annually in previous years, which was 120,000 to 135,000 tons of rice. Although China's grain harvest in 1965 was relatively good, it still could not meet the needs of all aspects of our country, including assisting other countries. In the negotiations with the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade delegation, our Ministry's delegation frankly explained our difficulties, and still made great efforts to offer to provide Cuba with 135,000 tons of rice in 1966, maintaining the level of 1964. The Cuban comrades are fully aware of these situations.
    Question: Prime Minister Castro said that he had suggested exchanging two tons of Cuban sugar for one ton of Chinese rice, and considered this exchange to be "long-term." Can you introduce the details of this matter?
    Answer: On October 1, 1964, Prime Minister Castro suggested to our Ambassador to Cuba, Comrade Wang Youping, that Cuba hoped to exchange 370,000 tons of sugar annually for 250,000 tons of rice from our country; the exchange ratio was one and a half tons of sugar for one ton of rice, not two tons of Cuban sugar for one ton of Chinese rice as Prime Minister Castro said in his January 2nd speech. At that time, the Chinese government carefully considered Prime Minister Castro's suggestion and agreed to provide Cuba with 250,000 tons of rice in 1965, but did not agree to supply this amount annually, nor did it accept the rice-sugar exchange ratio proposed by Prime Minister Castro. The 250,000 tons of rice provided by China in 1965 was converted according to the actual contract price, while the price of sugar was still calculated according to the original contract price agreed upon by both parties, so one ton of Cuban sugar exchanged for 1.12 tons of Chinese rice.
    On October 24, 1964, Ambassador Wang Youping delivered a memorandum from the Chinese government to Comrade Torres, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba, regarding Prime Minister Castro's opinion on sugar for rice, clearly replying that 250,000 tons of rice would be supplied to Cuba in 1965 and included in the 1965 trade protocol between the two countries, with the sugar price calculated according to the relevant contract provisions between the Chinese and Cuban governments, and the rice price calculated according to international market prices. This is a matter of record.
    The Chinese and Cuban governments have never signed an agreement for China to supply Cuba with 250,000 tons of rice annually on a long-term basis. After China replied to Prime Minister Castro's suggestion, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade never raised the issue of requesting China to supply Cuba with 250,000 tons of rice on a long-term basis in their contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Cuba. When the Cuban government trade delegation, headed by Comrade Maldonado, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of Cuba, came to Beijing in December 1964 to negotiate and sign the long-term trade agreement between the Chinese and Cuban governments for 1965-1970 and the 1965 trade protocol, this issue was not raised either. Obviously, Prime Minister Castro's belief that China would supply Cuba with 250,000 tons of rice on a long-term basis is unfounded.
    Question: Prime Minister Castro also mentioned the issue of economic cooperation loans and trade loans provided by China to Cuba. Prime Minister Castro said that in the 1966 trade negotiations between the two countries, the Cuban side proposed using economic cooperation loans to offset the trade deficit with China, and "the Chinese side replied that they could not decide on the issue of using economic loans, and this issue should be raised at the government level." What exactly is going on?
    Answer: On November 30, 1960, the Chinese and Cuban governments signed an economic cooperation agreement for 1960-1965. The agreement stipulated that the Chinese government would grant the government of the Republic of Cuba an interest-free loan of 240 million old rubles (equivalent to 60 million US dollars) without any conditions or privileges. According to the agreement, this loan was provided in the form of complete sets of equipment and technology to help Cuba's economic construction. This is different from trade loans. If the Cuban side needs to use this loan for other purposes, it should be resolved through consultation between the two governments. For example, in 1965, after consultation between the Chinese and Cuban governments, a portion of the economic cooperation loan (equivalent to 15 million US dollars) was used to offset the Cuban trade deficit with China in the implementation of Sino-Cuban trade in 1965.
    In the preliminary trade negotiations for 1966, the Cuban side proposed using the remaining balance of the economic cooperation loan to offset the trade deficit with China in 1966, which was originally negotiable. Since this issue involved the implementation of the economic cooperation agreement between the two countries, according to the division of responsibilities of our government departments, this issue was handled by the Commission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries. Therefore, our delegation expressed the hope that the relevant Cuban departments would consult with our Commission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries, which was a very reasonable response. However, Cuba has not yet contacted our Commission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries on this issue. Prime Minister Castro raised this issue in his speech, as if China refused to conduct negotiations, which is not consistent with the facts.
    Question: What are your views on Prime Minister Castro's speech announcing the preliminary situation of Sino-Cuban trade negotiations for 1966?
    Answer: According to the usual practice of Sino-Cuban trade negotiations, preliminary negotiations for trade between the two countries in 1966 are first conducted in Beijing, and then the Chinese government sends a delegation to Havana to formally sign the annual protocol. Now the delegation from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade is still in Beijing, the preliminary trade negotiations between the two sides are still in progress, and the annual protocol has not been finally signed. If the Cuban government has different opinions and requirements, it can completely raise them for consultation with the Chinese government. However, Prime Minister Castro not only did not do so, but also took an unusual approach in normal state relations, unilaterally and untruthfully announcing the preliminary trade negotiations being conducted by the relevant departments of the two governments at the mass rally in Havana celebrating the seventh anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. We cannot help but feel regret about this.
    Sino-Cuban trade negotiations are held every year, and there are different opinions in the negotiations every year. However, Prime Minister Castro has never taken the approach he is taking now. Why did Prime Minister Castro suddenly take this unusual approach on the eve of the Tricontinental Conference being held in Havana? This is worth thinking about carefully.
    Finally, the responsible person of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade stated: Since the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the relations between China and Cuba have been very friendly. The Chinese people have always highly praised the Cuban people's heroic struggle against US imperialism and regarded it as a strong support for the Chinese people. We believe that the Cuban people can fully understand the position of the Chinese people and understand the Chinese people's fraternal friendship towards the Cuban people; the profound friendship established between the Chinese and Cuban peoples in the common struggle against US imperialism will surely overcome various obstacles and continue to develop and strengthen.

    我对外贸易部负责人向记者发表谈话
    说明中古贸易问题的事实真相
    卡斯特罗总理在哈瓦那群众大会上所谈一九六六年中国对古巴的出口下降到了比从一九六一年到一九六五年任何贸易年度都低的水平，所谓中国将长期供应古巴二十五万吨大米和米糖交换比例，以及所谓中国拒绝商谈古巴利用经济贷款弥补对中国贸易逆差的问题，都是不符合事实的。在三大洲人民团结会议召开前夕，卡斯特罗总理突然异乎寻常地单方面地不真实地公布双方正在进行的初步贸易谈判情况，我们不能不对此感到遗憾。相信古巴人民完全能理解中国人民的立场，中古人民的深厚友谊必能加强。
    新华社九日讯　一月二日古巴菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理在哈瓦那庆祝古巴解放七周年群众集会的讲话中以很大的篇幅谈到了中古贸易的问题。为了弄清事实真相，本社记者特地访问了我对外贸易部负责人，就有关问题进行了谈话，问题和答复全文如下：
    问：卡斯特罗总理在一月二日群众大会的讲话中提到，一九六六年中古两国的贸易额比一九六五年下降了，中国对古巴的出口，下降到了“比从一九六一年到一九六五年任何贸易年度都低的水平”。是否可以请你介绍一下一九六六年中古贸易谈判情况。
    答：由古巴对外贸易部亚洲社会主义国家司司长伊萨梅尔·贝略同志率领的古巴对外贸易部代表团于一九六五年十一月十日来北京，同我对外贸易部相应的代表团就一九六六年的两国贸易进行初步商谈，这一商谈正在进行中。
    根据我部代表团的报告，目前双方代表团初步商谈的一九六六年中古两国的贸易额比一九六五年是有所下降，但是仍然高于一九六二年和一九六三年，而相当于一九六四年的水平。卡斯特罗总理说，中国对古巴的出口下降到了“比从一九六一年到一九六五年任何贸易年度都低的水平”，这是不符合事实的。每个国家都根据它当时的经济状况，安排各自的对外贸易。因此，在国际贸易中，贸易额有时高有时低是经常出现的情况。几年来，中古两国的贸易额也是这样，一九六一年高一点，一九六二年、一九六三年低一点，一九六四年高一点，一九六五年又高一点。如果一九六六年有所下降，这完全是正常的现象。
    社会主义国家在贸易上是相互支援的，同时又是根据各自的需要和可能互通有无的。在两个国家的贸易往来中，一方不能满足对方需要的情况是常有的。这种情况在中古过去几年的贸易谈判中发生过，在这次商谈中也碰到了。我们有一些商品没有满足古巴的要求，同样古巴也有一些商品没有满足我们的要求。在这次商谈中，古方提出要求我们在一九六六年供应古巴二十八万五千四百吨大米，这比前几年我们一般每年供应古巴十二万吨到十三万五千吨大米的数量多了一倍。一九六五年我国的粮食收成虽然比较好，但仍不能满足我国各方面、包括援助其它国家的需要。我部代表团在同古巴对外贸易部代表团谈判中，一方面坦率地说明了我们的困难，另一方面还是尽了很大的努力，提出在一九六六年提供古巴十三万五千吨大米，保持了一九六四年的水平。这些情况古巴同志是完全清楚的。
    问：卡斯特罗总理说，他曾经建议用两吨古巴食糖换一吨中国大米，并认为这个交换是“长期的”。能不能请你介绍一下这件事情的经过情况。
    答：一九六四年十月一日卡斯特罗总理向我国驻古巴大使王幼平同志建议，古巴希望每年用三十七万吨糖交换我国二十五万吨大米；交换的比例是一吨半糖换一吨大米，而不是象卡斯特罗总理在一月二日的讲话中所说的那样，用两吨古巴糖换一吨中国大米。当时中国政府慎重地考虑了卡斯特罗总理的这个建议，同意在一九六五年一年内给古巴提供二十五万吨大米，但未答应每年照此数供应，也未接受卡斯特罗总理提出来的米糖交换的比例。一九六五年中国提供的二十五万吨大米按实际合同价格折算，而糖的价格仍按原来双方商定的合同价格计算，因而古巴的一吨糖换中国的一点一二吨大米。
    一九六四年十月二十四日王幼平大使向古巴代理外交部长托拉斯同志送交一份中国政府对卡斯特罗总理关于糖换大米的意见的备忘录，明确答复在一九六五年供应古巴二十五万吨大米，并列入一九六五年两国贸易议定书中，糖价按中古两国政府有关合同规定，米价按国际市场价格计算。这是有案可查的。
    中古两国政府从未签订过长期由中国按年供应古巴二十五万吨大米的协定。在中国答复卡斯特罗总理的建议以后，古巴外交部、对外贸易部在同中国驻古巴大使馆的接触中，从未提出要求中国长期供应古巴二十五万吨大米的问题。一九六四年十二月以古巴对外贸易部副部长马尔多纳多同志为首的古巴政府贸易代表团来北京同我国政府商谈和签订中古两国政府一九六五年至一九七○年长期贸易协定和一九六五年贸易议定书的时候，也没有提出这一问题。很显然，卡斯特罗总理认为中国将长期供应古巴二十五万吨大米，是没有根据的。
    问：卡斯特罗总理在讲话中还提到中国给古巴的经济合作贷款和贸易贷款的问题，卡斯特罗总理说在一九六六年两国贸易谈判中，古方提出利用经济合作贷款来弥补对中国贸易逆差，“中国方面回答说，他们不能决定利用经济贷款的问题，应该在政府级提出这个问题”。这到底是怎么一回事情？
    答：一九六○年十一月三十日中古两国政府签订了一九六○年至一九六五年的经济合作协定。协定规定中国政府给予古巴共和国政府以无息的和不附带任何条件和特权的贷款二亿四千万旧卢布（相当于六千万美元）。根据协定规定，这笔贷款是以成套设备和技术的方式提供，帮助古巴经济建设。这同贸易贷款是两回事。如果古方需要将这笔贷款用在其它方面，应该经过两国政府商谈解决。比如，一九六五年经中、古两国政府协商，用经济合作贷款的一部分（相当于一千五百万美元），弥补一九六五年中古贸易执行中古巴对中国贸易的逆差。
    在一九六六年的初步贸易谈判中，古方提出要动用经济合作贷款的部分余额，来弥补对中国一九六六年的贸易差额，这本来是可以商量的。由于这个问题涉及到执行两国经济合作协定的问题，按照我国政府部门的分工，这个问题是由对外经济联络委员会负责处理的，因此我方代表团表示希望古巴有关部门同我国对外经济联络委员会商谈，这是很合理的答复。但至今古巴并未同我对外经济联络委员会就此问题进行接触。而卡斯特罗总理讲话中提出这个问题，似乎中国拒绝进行商谈，这是不符合事实的。
    问：你对卡斯特罗总理公布中古两国一九六六年贸易初步谈判情况的讲话有何看法？
    答：根据中古两国贸易谈判惯例，一九六六年两国贸易先在北京进行初步商谈，然后由中国政府派代表团去哈瓦那正式签订年度议定书。现在古巴外贸部的代表团还在北京，双方初步贸易谈判正在进行，年度议定书尚未最后签定。古巴政府如有不同意见和要求，完全可以提出来同中国政府商谈。但是卡斯特罗总理不仅没有这样做，而且还采取了在通常国家关系中异乎寻常的做法，在哈瓦那庆祝古巴解放七周年的群众大会上，单方面地不真实地公布两国政府有关部门正在进行的初步贸易谈判情况。对此，我们不能不感到遗憾。
    中古两国的贸易谈判年年有，在谈判中出现这样或者那样的不同意见也年年都有。可是，卡斯特罗总理过去从没有采取过现在的作法。为什么现在在三大洲人民团结会议在哈瓦那召开的前夕，卡斯特罗总理却突然采取这种异乎寻常的做法呢？这是值得人们很好地想一想的。
    最后，中国对外贸易部负责人表示：古巴革命胜利以来，中古两国的关系一直是很友好的。中国人民对古巴人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争，一向给以高度的评价，视为对中国人民有力的支持。我们相信，古巴人民完全能理解中国人民的立场，理解中国人民对古巴人民的兄弟情谊；中古两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的深厚友谊，必能排除各种障碍继续得到发展和加强。
