　　Selling Buttons and Doing Revolution
　　Li Guirong, Salesperson of the Seventh Store of Harbin Department Store

    I originally worked in the cosmetics section, but later the organization transferred me to the button section. I was very uneasy about selling buttons at first. I thought this work was too scattered, there were too many customers, the work was busy, and I couldn't earn much money. I couldn't learn any skills and there was no prospect for development. After studying articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I realized that revolutionary work is always concrete, and small things add up to a great revolutionary cause. As long as we see the masses in our eyes, think of the masses in our hearts, and do everything for the masses, no matter what work we do, we can dedicate our strength to the revolution and the people. Buttons are small, but everyone needs them. If a button is missing from clothing, it looks untidy; if too many buttons are missing, the cold wind can cause a cold; if workers' clothes are missing buttons, it may cause accidents; if the People's Liberation Army lacks buttons, it will hinder military discipline. Thus, I thought: it seems that selling buttons is an ordinary and trivial job, but it is an indispensable part of revolutionary work. From then on, I felt that my work was very glorious, and I wanted to play the role of a screw in the cause of socialist revolution and construction.

    卖扣子和干革命
    哈尔滨市百货公司第七商店营业员　李桂荣
    我原来在化装组，后来组织上把我调到扣子组。我刚开始卖扣子很不安心。认为这工作太零乱，买的人多，工作忙，还卖不了多少钱。自己学不到什么本领，没啥发展前途。我学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》等文章后，认识到：革命工作总是具体的，一件件小事就铸成了伟大的革命事业。只要眼睛里看到群众，心里想到了群众，处处事事为了群众，不管干什么工作，都可以为革命为人民献出自己的力量。扣子虽小，每个人都离不开它。如果衣服上少一个扣子，就显得不够整齐；扣子少的多了，凉风吹起还可能引起感冒；工人的衣服上少了扣子，还可能因此引起事故；解放军缺少了扣子，就有碍军风纪。这样，我就想到：看来卖扣子是一件平凡而又琐碎的工作，但它是革命工作中不可缺少的一部分。从此，我就感到我的工作非常光荣，我要在社会主义革命和建设事业中，起一个螺丝钉的作用。
