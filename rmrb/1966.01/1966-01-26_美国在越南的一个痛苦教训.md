    "A Painful Lesson for the United States in Vietnam"
    The January 17th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" published an article entitled "A Painful Lesson for the United States in Vietnam," lamenting the United States' isolation in its war of aggression against Vietnam and its failure to drag "allies" into the conflict. This article reflects the embarrassing predicament of the U.S. ruling clique, being "forsaken for its lack of righteousness." The article is excerpted and annotated below:
    Where have America's "allies" gone when things have reached a critical juncture? In Vietnam, even symbolic assistance from Asian partners is hard to come by. There seems to be a prevailing sentiment: Let Uncle Sam handle everything. This is another painful lesson learned from a distant war. (Looking around the world, standing alone, how could one not feel great pain! However, the likes of Johnson may not accept this painful lesson, so even greater pain lies ahead!)
    How wonderful it would be if the war in Vietnam took a different turn! A war in which Asians themselves would be willing to help Americans stop communism. (Should be read as promote colonialism) Troops from Japan, the Philippines, and India would be willing to actively help. So would troops from Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, and other places. (Using Asians to fight Asians, what a wonderful plan! But currently, on the South Vietnamese battlefield, besides the South Korean puppets, none of America's Asian "allies" are willing to pull chestnuts out of the fire for it. Thus, the U.S. aggressor troops have no choice but to go into battle themselves shirtless.)
    Look at the actual situation of the Vietnam War:
    The burden does not fall on South Vietnam, but directly on the United States, a country eight thousand miles away from the main danger point. It is American money and weapons that keep the resistance to communist action going. In addition to money, more and more American youths are being drafted and sent to the jungles of Asia to fight. (Since they are eight thousand miles apart, how could the so-called "burden" cross the ocean and "fall" on the United States? The truth is, the American aggressors themselves stretched their necks too far and stuck them into a noose eight thousand miles away.)
    U.S. officials say they are learning a painful lesson from this go-it-alone war: Not only are America's European allies unwilling to lift a finger to help with the Vietnam issue, but even Asians themselves are unwilling to help defend their own part of the world.
    In Washington, another authority said: "We do not expect non-communist Asia to fully participate and share the burden of the war. But we wholeheartedly welcome a willingness to step forward." (Clearly, they don't expect it, yet they say "do not expect it," which is very much like the fox in Aesop's fables who couldn't reach the grapes and said they were sour. But then they immediately give themselves away, saying "wholeheartedly welcome," which makes that "authority" in Washington even more grotesque than that fox.)
    Contrary to expectations, past experience shows that when things reach a critical juncture, America's "allies" are unwilling to be dragged down.
    Since the end of World War II, the United States has invested more than 35 billion U.S. dollars in non-communist areas of Asia to support civilian economies and defense forces.
    It has meticulously negotiated and signed mutual defense treaties with Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Nationalist China. It has concluded a tripartite treaty with Australia and New Zealand. In 1954, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was formed.
    For more than a year, U.S. officials in Washington have been counting on assistance from non-communist Asian countries—especially those with treaty obligations to the United States. (The United States has signed so many military treaties in Asia, all in the name of "helping" its "allies," and now it is asking its "allies" to "help" itself in return. This is indeed a great irony!)
    The result so far is that members of the ANZUS treaty—Australia and New Zealand—have provided symbolic troops, and South Korea has sent a reinforced division. Other countries have not even sent symbolic troops.
    The fact is that, although U.S. officials say the United States only hopes to obtain some symbolic assistance to deal with its growing military—engineering, medical, airlift—shortages, to deal with the shortage of combat troops, the United States now finds its strength spread very thinly around the world.
    A senior U.S. military officer said, "This experience in Vietnam makes it unclear what the (U.S.) efforts over the past twenty years to win reliable allies have achieved." (Forsaken for its lack of righteousness, no matter how much the United States "tries" to "win reliable allies," it cannot change its increasingly isolated situation.) (Attached picture)

### “美国在越南的一个痛苦教训”

专栏：外论批注

    “美国在越南的一个痛苦教训”
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志一月十七日出版的一期，刊载了一篇题为《美国在越南的一个痛苦教训》的文章，哀鸣美国进行侵越战争孤立无援，想拉“盟国”下水未能得逞。这篇文章反映了美国统治集团“失道寡助”的狼狈处境。现将该文加以摘译，并加批注，发表如下：当事情到了紧要关头，美国的“盟国”到哪里去了？在越南，从亚洲的伙伴们那里，就连象征性的援助也很难得到。人们似乎抱着这样一种情绪：全让山姆大叔去干好了。这是从一场远方的战争中产生的又一个痛苦教训。（环顾世界，形单影只，怎不令人痛苦万分！但是，约翰逊之流不见得会接受这种痛苦的教训，因此更大的痛苦还在后头呢！）
    要是在越南进行的战争变成另外一种情形该多好啊！在这个战争里，亚洲人自己愿意帮助美国人来阻止共产主义。（应读作推行殖民主义）从日本、菲律宾、印度来的军队都愿意积极帮忙。从巴基斯坦、泰国、马来西亚等地来的部队也是一样。（用亚洲人打亚洲人，这是多么如意的算盘。但是，目前在南越战场上，除了南朝鲜傀儡外，美国的亚洲“盟国”谁也无意为它火中取栗。这样就只好由美国侵略军自己赤膊上阵了。）
    瞧瞧越南战争的实际情况：
    负担不是落在南越身上，而是直接落在距离这个主要危险点八千英里的一个国家——美国的身上。使抵抗共产党行动继续下去的是美国的金钱和武器。除了金钱以外，有越来越多的美国青年被征召，送到亚洲的丛林中去作战。（既然相隔八千英里，所谓“负担”怎么会远渡重洋去“落在”美国身上呢？事实是，美国侵略者自己把脖子伸得长长的，钻进了八千英里以外的绞索里。）
    美国官员说，他们从这场单干的战争中正在吸取一个痛苦的教训：不仅美国的欧洲盟国不肯动一动手指头在越南问题上帮帮忙，而且连亚洲人自己也不愿意帮助保卫他们自己在世界上的这部分地区。
    在华盛顿，另一个权威人士这样说：“我们并不指望非共产党亚洲完全参加进来、分担战争。但是我们衷心欢迎的是一种挺身而出的意愿。”（明明是指望不到，偏偏说“并不指望”，这多么象《伊索寓言》里那只吃不着葡萄而说葡萄酸的狐狸。但是，紧接着又自露马脚，说“衷心欢迎”，这就使华盛顿的那个“权威人士”比起那只狐狸来更加丑态毕露了。）
    事与愿违，过去的情况表明，当事情到了紧要关头，美国的“盟友”都不愿意被拉下水。
    自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美国在亚洲非共产主义地区投入了三百五十多亿美元，支持民间经济和防御力量。
    与日本、菲律宾、南朝鲜和国民党中国周密地谈判和签署了共同防务条约。与澳大利亚、新西兰订立了三国条约。一九五四年组成了东南亚条约组织。
    一年多以来，华盛顿的美国官员一直指望得到亚洲非共产党国家——特别是那些对美国有条约义务的国家的帮助。（美国在亚洲订那么多军事条约，都美其名曰“帮助”它的“盟国”，现在倒反过来要它的“盟国”“帮助”自己，这的确是个莫大的讽刺！）
    到目前为止的结果是：澳新美安全条约成员国——澳大利亚和新西兰——提供了象征性的军队，南朝鲜派了一个加强师。其他国家甚至连象征性的军队都没有派。
    事实是，尽管美国官员说美国只不过希望取得一些象征性的援助，来对付它日益增长的军事上——工程、医务、空运——的不足，来对付战斗部队的不足，美国现在发觉自己的力量在世界各地散布得很单薄。
    一个美国的高级军官说，“在越南得到的这一经验，使它弄不懂（美国）战后二十年来为争取可靠的盟友所作的努力到底取得了什么结果。”（失道寡助，不管美国如何“努力”来“争取可靠的盟友”，也不能改变自己日益孤立的处境。）（附图片）
