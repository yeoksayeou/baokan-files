    Revolutionary "Stinginess" and "Generosity"
    Zhou Hongxing
    Recently, I heard two stories about Chen Yonggui of Dazhai.
    Chen Yonggui, after attending a meeting in Taiyuan, passed through Yangquan and found a place to stay that cost "three mao." A comrade discovered that this "peasant" was the nationally renowned Chen Yonggui and exclaimed in surprise, "How can you stay here! There are rooms upstairs that cost one yuan and five mao, it's more comfortable. You went to Taiyuan for a meeting, the government will reimburse it anyway..." Chen Yonggui replied, "Precisely because the government will reimburse it, I found the cheapest place." This same Comrade Chen Yonggui, when he learned that a brother production team had suffered a disaster and lacked feed for their livestock, personally led commune members to the fields to gather corn leaves to feed the cattle and horses, while donating the good grain straw saved from his own team to the brother team.
    Looking at these two things together is very interesting.
    If viewed from the perspective of "the government will reimburse it anyway," wouldn't it be too "stingy" to forgo the "comfort" of one yuan and five mao and "squat" overnight in a "three mao" place? Similarly, if viewed from the perspective of "the government will take care of it anyway," wouldn't it be too "generous" to give the team's good straw to others? However, this seemingly contradictory phenomenon of being both "stingy" and "generous" is so naturally unified in revolutionaries like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Chen Yonggui.
    Different people have different understandings and attitudes towards "stinginess" and "generosity." Those who believe "the government will reimburse it anyway" are indeed sometimes very "generous." Don't we often hear them discussing things like this?—— "Since the government will reimburse it anyway, why not buy the expensive stuff, why not buy more?", "Since the government will reimburse it anyway, out with the old, in with the new, let's buy a new one!" etc. But it is also often these people who believe in "the government will reimburse it anyway" who are most concerned with personal gains and losses and who are the most adept at playing petty games, because they always view "public" matters with a "private" eye. To put it bluntly, behind the phrase "the government will reimburse it anyway" lies a hidden "selfishness."
    Revolutionaries are filled with class resentment and strive for the strength of the motherland; they understand both the hardship of establishing revolutionary enterprises and the significance of maintaining the revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living; everything they think and do is for the revolution and the interests of the people.
    The "stinginess" and "generosity" of revolutionaries are fundamentally different from the "stinginess" and "generosity" of individualists: one shines with the brilliance of the era, the other exudes the stench of decay; one is the product of a communist worldview, the other stems from personal selfishness. The more people there are like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Chen Yonggui who are "stingy" in spending "public" money and "generous" in supporting other people and other units, the more forcefully we can promote our society to rise to a newer and higher realm.

    革命者的“小气”和“大方”
    舟红行
    最近听到大寨陈永贵的两桩事。
    陈永贵从太原开罢会回去，路过阳泉，找了个“三毛钱”的地方住下来。有位同志发现这位“庄稼汉”就是全国闻名的陈永贵，惊异地说：“你怎么能住这里！楼上有一元五的房间，住的舒服。你到太原开会，反正是公家报销……”陈永贵回答说：“正是因为公家报销，我才找最便宜的地方。”同一个陈永贵同志，当他知道兄弟生产队闹了灾，牲口缺少饲料的时候，便亲自率领社员到田里拾玉茭叶喂牛马，而将省下的好谷草支援兄弟队。
    把两件事联系起来看，很有意思。
    如果用“反正公家报销”的观点看来，舍其一元五的“舒服”，而在“三毛钱”的地方“蹲”一夜，岂不是太“小气”了吗？同样，如果用“反正公家会管”的观点看来，把本队的好草去支援人家，不也太“大方”了吗？然而正是这种既“小气”又“大方”的看来很矛盾的现象，却是那样自然地统一在雷锋、王杰、陈永贵这些革命者的身上。
    对“小气”和“大方”，不同的人有不同的理解，并持不同的态度。“反正公家报销”的人，他们的确有时很“大方”，我们不是常常听到他们这样议论吗？——“反正公家报销，为啥不买贵的，为啥不多买点呢？”，“反正公家报销，旧的不去，新的不来，再买个新的吧！”等等。可也经常是这些“反正公家报销”的人，最爱计较个人得失，最会打小算盘，因为他们总是以“私家”的眼光来看待“公家”的事物，说穿了，在“反正公家报销”这句话背后，还掩藏着一颗“私心”。
    革命者，发的是阶级之愤，图的是祖国之强；既懂得创立革命大业之艰辛，也明白保持艰苦朴素革命传统的意义；他们所想所做的，都是革命，都是人民的利益。
    革命者的“小气”和“大方”，与个人主义者的“小气”和“大方”是根本不同的：一个闪耀着时代的光彩，一个散发着腐朽的气息；一个是共产主义世界观的产儿，一个是出自个人的私心。象雷锋、王杰、陈永贵那样“小气”地花“公家”的钱，“大方”地支援别人别单位的人越多，就能越有力地推动我们的社会上升到一个更新更高的境界去。
