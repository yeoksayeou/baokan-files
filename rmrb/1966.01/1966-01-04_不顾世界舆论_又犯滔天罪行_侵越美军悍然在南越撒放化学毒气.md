    Disregarding World Opinion, Committing Heinous Crimes Again
    Invading American Troops Brazenly Released Chemical Poison Gas in South Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd -- Saigon News: The American aggressors, disregarding the strong opposition of world opinion, brazenly released chemical poison gas against the Liberation Armed Forces again on the 2nd during a battle near Saigon. According to reports, the troops of the American 173rd Airborne Brigade encountered fierce resistance from the Liberation Armed Forces near Saigon on the 2nd and were beaten into a terrible state. The American bandits revealed their ferocity and immediately dispatched helicopters to spread chemical poison gas over the positions of the Liberation Armed Forces. The American troops on the ground also "fired some gas grenades with their rifles."
    The Associated Press said that this was "the first time such large-scale use" of chemical poison gas "in Vietnam."
    However, the Associated Press report admitted that this "gas warfare failed to dislodge many Viet Cong (Liberation Armed Forces), and many soldiers present thought it was a waste of time." Due to the "terrain," "the gas lost most of its effectiveness"; "the wind direction was also uncertain, blowing some of the gas from the Viet Cong side towards the Americans." The report said: "The Viet Cong, entrenched in the dense wild sugarcane and bamboo groves, generally seemed unaffected by the gas."

    不顾世界舆论　又犯滔天罪行
    侵越美军悍然在南越撒放化学毒气
    新华社三日讯　西贡消息：美国侵略者不顾世界舆论的强烈反对，二日在西贡附近的一次战斗中悍然再次对解放武装力量撒放了化学毒气。据报道，美国一七三空降旅的部队二日在西贡附近遭到了解放武装力量的猛烈阻击，被打得狼狈不堪。美国强盗凶相毕露，随即派直升飞机对解放武装力量的阵地散播化学毒气，地面上的美军也“用他们的步枪放射了一些瓦斯榴弹”。
    美联社说，这是“第一次在越南这样大规模地使用”化学毒气。
    但是，美联社的报道承认，这次“瓦斯战没有能够逐退许多越共（解放武装力量），在场的许多士兵认为这是浪费时间”。由于“地形”的关系，“瓦斯失去了它的大部分作用”；“风向也不定，把一些瓦斯从越共那边刮向美国人”。报道说：“在茂密的野生甘蔗和竹丛中据守的越共看来一般都没有受瓦斯的影响”。
