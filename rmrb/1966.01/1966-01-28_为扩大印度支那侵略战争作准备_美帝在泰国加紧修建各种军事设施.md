    In Preparation for Expanding the Indochina War of Aggression
    US Imperialism Intensifies the Construction of Various Military Facilities in Thailand
    An article by Baldwin published in the U.S.《New York Times》 on January 24th reveals that, in order to expand the Indochina war of aggression, U.S. imperialism is stepping up the construction of various military facilities in Thailand and preparing to more than double the number of its current 13,000+ military personnel stationed in Thailand.  An excerpt of the article follows:
    There are now hundreds of American aircraft and more than 13,000 American soldiers stationed in Thailand, and this number is expected to more than double if the Vietnam War continues.
    U.S. Air Force aircraft have been taking off from five bases in Thailand to attack North Vietnam and the Communist supply corridors in Laos.
    Army forces have maintained weapons, supplies and equipment sufficient to equip several thousand troops who can be quickly airlifted to Thailand when needed. These stockpiles include hundreds of vehicles and tanks, field guns, and thousands of tons of supplies. Army engineers and other units, together with the Thais, have been renovating and constructing roads, airports, oil depots, pipelines and other supply facilities.
    Now, in addition to their work, two huge civilian construction companies are participating. These two companies have already started construction of an 11,500-foot-long airport near the Thai Sattahip naval base on the Gulf of Siam. When this airport is completed this summer, it will be the largest airport in Thailand, capable of handling all types of aircraft.  There are also plans to build another 10,000-foot-long airport and important support facilities, all of which will be completed within two to three years.
    There are also plans to build a large marine terminal near Sattahip, or perhaps near Sriracha, capable of berthing deep-draft oil tankers and freighters. An ammunition loading and unloading dock has been built near Sriracha, and an army ammunition depot is also planned. Once this seaport is completed, it will eliminate one of Thailand's greatest military weaknesses—the lack of an adequate seaport. Bangkok is located twenty-seven miles north of a narrow and silted river channel, and its channel depth and wharf facilities are insufficient to accommodate large amounts of traffic.
    Current construction plans also include extending and expanding runways, new taxiways and parking lots at the five major airports in Thailand that are jointly used by Thai and American aircraft.
    The possibility of building a pipeline from the Gulf of Siam to the Khorat Plateau region is also being studied, and preparations are being made to build permanent U.S. military communications facilities to replace the current mobile radio (tropospheric scatter) stations. This construction plan is to strengthen what the U.S. Army calls a logistics base, that is, supporting supply facilities, by eliminating some of the current obstacles to supporting military forces in Thailand.

### 为扩大印度支那侵略战争作准备  美帝在泰国加紧修建各种军事设施

专栏：外论摘要

    为扩大印度支那侵略战争作准备
    美帝在泰国加紧修建各种军事设施
    美国《纽约时报》一月二十四日刊登鲍德温写的一篇文章，透露美帝国主义为了扩大印度支那侵略战争，正在泰国加紧修建各种军事设施，并准备将现驻泰国的一万三千多名军事人员增加一倍以上。现将该文摘译如下：
    现在驻在泰国的美国飞机有几百架，美国军人有一万三千多，如果越南战争继续下去，预计人数会增加一倍以上。
    美国的空军一直在从泰国的五个基地上起飞袭击北越和在老挝的共产党供应走廊。
    陆军部队一直保持着足以装备在需要时可以很快空运至泰国的几千名部队的武器、供应品和装备。这些储存品中包括数以百计的车辆和坦克、野战炮及数千吨的供应物资。陆军的工兵和其他部队同泰国人一起一直在整修和修建公路、机场、油库、油管和其他供应设施。
    现在除了他们的工作以外，还有两家巨大的民用建筑公司参加。这两家公司已经在暹罗湾上的泰国梭桃邑海军基地附近开始修建一个一万一千五百英尺长的机场。当这个机场在今年夏天竣工时，它将是泰国最大的机场，能够起降一切类型的飞机。还计划再修建一个一万英尺长的机场和重要的支持设施，所有这一切工程都将在两三年内完成。
    还计划在梭桃邑附近或者也许在锡腊恰附近修建一个大型海运终点站，可以停泊吃水深的油船和货船。在锡腊恰附近已经修建了一个弹药装卸码头，还准备修一个陆军的弹药库。这个海港建成以后，将会消除泰国的最大军事弱点之一——缺少一个适当的海港。曼谷位于一条狭隘和淤塞的河道以北二十七英里，它的河道的深度和码头设施都不足以容纳大量来往船只。
    目前的建筑计划也包括在泰国的五个泰国和美国飞机共同使用的主要机场上延长和扩充跑道、新的出租汽车场和停车场。
    还在研究修建一条从暹罗湾到呵叻高原地区的油管的可能性，并准备修建永久性的美国军事通讯设施来代替目前的流动无线电（对流播送）站。这个建筑计划是为了加强美国陆军所谓的后勤基地，即支持供应设施，办法就是消除目前的某些妨碍支持在泰国的军事部队的障碍。
