    Blast furnace ironmaking has always used metallurgical coke as fuel. "Blast furnace injection technology" refers to the injection of heavy oil, coal tar, asphalt, natural gas, coal powder, etc. into the blast furnace to partially replace coke as a fuel for ironmaking.

    This technology has only emerged in the world in the last decade or so. Injecting liquid and gaseous fuels into blast furnaces is relatively simple and has been widely adopted by many countries. However, injecting solid fuel – coal powder – into blast furnaces is a very complex new ironmaking technology. Some technologically advanced countries in the world began exploring the technology of injecting coal powder more than a decade ago, but it is still in the experimental stage.

    China's new technology for blast furnace injection of solid fuel – coal powder – began in 1962. Although the time has been short, thanks to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, daring to think and act, and courage to create, the iron and steel industry workers have successfully tested it in just over two years. They have basically mastered the operational rules for preventing accidents such as explosions and nodulation in blast furnaces during the coal powder injection process, catching up with and surpassing the world's most advanced level. This is a major victory for China's ironmaking technology in climbing to the world's peak.

    In many countries around the world, the fuels injected into blast furnaces are mainly heavy oil and natural gas. However, China has taken a unique path of multiple fuel injection in injection technology, which is of great significance for increasing production and practicing economy. According to statistics, the coke consumption per ton of pig iron is reduced by 30%, 13%, and 8% respectively by using multiple fuels for blast furnace injection. For every ton of coal powder injected, the cost of pig iron can be reduced by more than 15 yuan. The coke saved can be used to produce more pig iron, which can enable the country to build fewer new coke ovens and save a lot of investment. It can also make fuller and more rational use of various coal resources, and save a lot of high-quality coking coal. (Zhao Xiaoyi) (Picture attached)
    Workers at the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant have also installed coal powder injection equipment on the No. 3 blast furnace. With this equipment, the blast furnace can be used to refine iron with the coal that people use for cooking, thereby reducing coke consumption.

    高炉喷吹技术
    高炉炼铁，过去一直都是采用冶金焦炭作燃料。“高炉喷吹技术”，是向高炉内喷吹重油、焦油、沥青、天然煤气、煤粉等，部分代替焦炭作炼铁燃料。
    这一技术是近十几年才在世界上出现的。向高炉喷吹液体和气体燃料比较简单，已被不少国家普遍采用。但向高炉喷吹固体燃料——煤粉，却是一项很复杂的炼铁新技术。世界上有一些技术比较先进的国家早在十多年前，就开始对喷吹煤粉的技术进行了探讨，但至今都还处于试验阶段。
    我国对高炉喷吹固体燃料——煤粉的新技术是从一九六二年开始的。虽然时间很短，但由于钢铁工业职工发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，敢想敢干、勇于创造，只用两年多的时间就试验成功了，并基本上掌握了在喷吹煤粉过程中，防止高炉发生爆炸、结瘤等事故的操作规律，赶上和超过了世界最先进水平。这是我国炼铁技术攀登世界高峰的一个重大胜利。
    世界上不少国家，向高炉喷吹的燃料，主要是重油、天然煤气。而我国在喷吹技术上走的是一条独特的多种燃料喷吹的道路，这对增产节约有重要的意义。据统计，采用多种燃料向高炉喷吹，冶炼每吨生铁的焦炭消耗量分别下降百分之三十、百分之十三和百分之八；每喷吹一吨煤粉，生铁成本就可以降低十五元以上；用节省下来的焦炭可以多增产生铁，能使国家少建新的焦炉，节约大量投资；可以更加充分、合理地利用各种煤炭资源，节约大量优质焦煤。　（赵晓义）（附图片）
    石钢炼铁厂工人在三号高炉上也安装了喷吹煤粉设备。有了这项设备，高炉就可以掺用人们烧火做饭的煤炼铁，从而降低焦炭的消耗量。
