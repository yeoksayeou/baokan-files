    Our people and youth, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fully loaded with the huge achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction, are stepping into 1966 with full confidence.

    In the new year, the Party and the people place great hopes on the younger generation. The most fundamental thing for Chinese youth to accomplish the glorious and arduous tasks entrusted to them by the Party is to give prominence to politics, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, to take class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment, to contribute to the completion of the Third Five-Year Plan, and to realize ideological revolutionization in the struggle.

    Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful ideological weapon for accomplishing all tasks. To give prominence to politics is to give prominence to Mao Zedong Thought. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought makes us fearless and invincible in the face of imperialism and all reactionaries; mastering Mao Zedong Thought allows us to dare to innovate and create in production and construction, and to complete tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Every youth can only achieve ideological revolutionization and ensure that they will always be revolutionary and never degenerate by studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought. The new upsurge in the ideological revolutionization of Chinese youth in the past year is the result of arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and tempering themselves in the three great revolutionary movements. The reason why Wang Jie was able to be neither afraid of hardship nor death, and wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution, was because he did "as Chairman Mao said, so I do." The Chinese women's table tennis team was able to "turn things around" in the 28th World Table Tennis Championships because they studied Chairman Mao's works and invigorated the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. Therefore, in the new year, we must put the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, carry out the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works more widely and deeply, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide action in revolutionary practice, and use Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems in actual struggle.

    Giving prominence to politics and studying Mao Zedong Thought, in the final analysis, is for the sake of making revolution, making revolution against the objective world and making revolution against the subjective world, closely combining the transformation of the objective world with the transformation of the subjective world. If studying is studying and doing is doing, and they are not related to each other, then not only can we not talk about studying Chairman Mao's works well, but we also fundamentally violate Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, when we study Chairman Mao's works, we must earnestly put effort into the word "use" and implement it in the word "revolution," dare to struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries; dare to struggle against domestic class enemies and bad people and bad deeds that undermine the cause of socialism; dare to change the world and transform nature; dare to break with bourgeois ideology and carry out strict self-ideological revolution, and transform the subjective world in the struggle to transform the objective world.

    To implement the study of Chairman Mao's works into revolutionary action is to implement it into preparing to deal with the aggression of U.S. imperialism. We must study Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, his thesis that imperialism is a paper tiger, and establish the idea of ​​hating the US, despising the US, and scorning the US. At the same time, we must strive to exercise our bodies, learn military technology, carry out military sports activities, and promote the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, so as to be both civil and military, and be ready to respond to the call immediately once the motherland needs us.

    To implement the study of Chairman Mao's works into revolutionary action is to implement it into actively participating in domestic class struggle. In the socialist period, there exists class struggle, and there exists the struggle between the two roads. We must study Chairman Mao's theory on classes, class contradictions, class struggle, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the socialist period, participate in the socialist education movement, participate in the class struggle in the ideological field, promote proletarian ideology, and eliminate bourgeois ideology.

    To implement the study of Chairman Mao's works into revolutionary action is to implement it into completing the Third Five-Year Plan. We must study Chairman Mao's instructions on self-reliance, striving for prosperity, hard struggle, and building the country with diligence and thrift, resolutely implement the general line of socialist construction, and go all out, aim high. We must carry forward the spirit of Daqing and Dazhai, establish lofty ambitions, combine revolutionary drive with scientific attitude, and achieve discoveries, inventions, creations, and advances on all fronts, and contribute the greatest strength to the Third Five-Year Plan.

    In order to lead the youth to complete new and great tasks, the work of the Communist Youth League must be further revolutionized. The revolutionization of the League's work first requires the ideological revolutionization of the League cadres. The League cadres must keep up with the situation, strive for initiative, and invigorate the revolutionary spirit. This revolutionary spirit should be: to take Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, talk about politics everywhere, and put the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of all work; it should be to implement the word "revolution" in all work, to dare to change the status quo, resolutely support revolutionary new things, and use the greatest strength to grasp typical examples and commend the advanced; it should be to have a vigorous and down-to-earth work style. We must fully follow the mass line, conduct thorough investigations and studies, and constantly sum up experience to make our work more active, more practical, and more vigorous.

    In the new year, let us hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, study Chairman Mao's works even better, use them even better, act as a shock brigade for realizing the Third Five-Year Plan, and make greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

    把活学活用毛泽东思想放在第一位
    ——《中国青年报》元旦社论摘要
    我国人民和青年，高举着毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，满载社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成果，充满信心地跨进了一九六六年。
    在新的一年，党和人民对青年一代寄托着很大希望。我国青年要完成党交给的光荣而艰巨的任务，最根本的就是要突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想的指引下，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，积极参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，为完成第三个五年计划作出贡献，在斗争中实现思想革命化。
    毛泽东思想，是我们完成一切任务最强大的思想武器。突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。掌握了毛泽东思想，在帝国主义和一切反动派面前，就无所畏惧，战无不胜；掌握了毛泽东思想，在生产建设中，就可以敢于革新，敢于创造，多快好省地完成任务。
    每个青年，只有学习和掌握毛泽东思想，才能实现思想革命化，保证永远革命，永不变质。过去一年中，我国青年的思想革命化出现了新的高涨，就是用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，在三大革命运动中锻炼的结果。王杰所以能一不怕苦，二不怕死，一心为革命，就是因为他做到了“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”。中国女子乒乓球队就是由于学了毛主席著作，振奋了敢于斗争敢于胜利的革命精神，才在第二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛中“翻了身”。因此，在新的一年中，我们必须把活学活用毛泽东思想放在第一位，更广泛更深入地开展学习毛主席著作的运动，在革命实践中，用毛泽东思想指导行动，用毛泽东思想解决实际斗争中的问题。
    突出政治，学习毛泽东思想，归根到底是为了闹革命，革客观世界的命，革主观世界的命，把改造客观世界和改造主观世界紧密结合起来。如果学归学，做归做，互相不沾边，那就不但谈不上学好毛主席著作，而且根本违背了毛泽东思想。所以，我们学习毛主席著作，一定要切实在“用”字上下功夫，落实到革命两个字上，敢于同帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派作斗争；敢于同国内阶级敌人和破坏社会主义事业的坏人坏事作斗争；敢于改天换地，改造大自然；敢于同资产阶级思想决裂，进行严格的自我思想革命，在改造客观世界的斗争中改造主观世界。
    学习毛主席著作，落实到革命行动上，就是要落实到准备对付美帝国主义的侵略上。我们要学习毛主席关于人民战争的思想，关于帝国主义是纸老虎的论断，树立起仇视美帝、鄙视美帝、蔑视美帝的思想。同时，要努力锻炼身体，学习军事技术，开展军事体育活动，发扬一不怕苦，二不怕死的革命精神，做到能文能武，随时做好准备，一旦祖国需要，立即响应召唤。
    学习毛主席著作，落实到革命行动上，就是要落实到积极参加国内阶级斗争中去。社会主义时期，存在着阶级斗争，存在着两条道路斗争。我们要学习毛主席关于社会主义时期阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争和社会主义与资本主义两条道路斗争的理论，参加社会主义教育运动，参加意识形态领域的阶级斗争，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想。
    学习毛主席著作，落实到革命行动上，就是要落实到完成第三个五年计划上去。我们要学习毛主席关于自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的指示，坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游。我们要发扬大庆、大寨精神，树立雄心壮志，把革命干劲和科学态度结合起来，在各个战线上，做到有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，为第三个五年计划贡献最大的力量。
    为了带领青年完成新的伟大任务，共青团的工作必须进一步实现革命化。团的工作的革命化，首先要求团干部思想革命化。团的干部要跟上形势，力争主动，振奋革命的精神状态。这种革命精神状态，应当是：以毛泽东思想挂帅，处处讲政治，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位；应当是在一切工作中贯彻革命两个字，要敢于改变现状，坚决支持革命的新事物，要用最大的力量去抓典型，表扬先进；应当是有雷厉风行和扎扎实实的工作作风。要充分走群众路线，充分做调查研究，不断地总结经验，把我们的工作做得更加活跃，更加实在，更加生气勃勃。
    让我们在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，把毛主席著作学得更好，用得更好，充当实现第三个五年计划的突击队，为中国革命和世界革命做出更大的贡献！
