    Emphasizing Politics, Work on Giving Preferential Treatment Achieves New Successes
    Over the past year, under the cordial care of the Party and the government, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans have continued to maintain and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, and have made contributions on all fronts.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch) In 1965, the work of giving preferential treatment and pensions to the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans in various parts of the country achieved new successes.
    Emphasizing politics in the work of giving preferential treatment was the focus of work over the past year. Various localities universally conducted class education, situation education, and internationalism and patriotism education for the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans. Many counties and cities in Fujian, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces held various meetings for the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans during the "August 1st" Army Day last year, and conducted the above-mentioned education for them. Various localities also paid special attention to organizing the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans to study Chairman Mao's works. In Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, more than 1,000 activists in studying Chairman Mao's works emerged among the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans. Wei Shixiang, a blind disabled soldier from Mashan County, Guangxi, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works in Braille, and often reported his learning experiences to young people and students, which was welcomed by the people. In Harbin, eleven families of soldiers in a residential committee raised their awareness after studying Chairman Mao's works. Originally, they rarely participated in social activities, but now many of them have taken on street work, and have collectively participated in more than 40 public welfare labors in the past year. These eleven families of soldiers are now all rated as five-good families of soldiers.
    Over the past year, various localities have further strengthened the leadership of the work of giving preferential treatment, widely carried out publicity and education among cadres and the masses, and enhanced the people's sense of national defense, and the social ethos of "supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers is everyone's responsibility" has been further developed. Many people's communes and production brigades have established preferential treatment committees, and schools have established preferential treatment groups to carry out regular preferential treatment activities. The health center of Huayan Lake Commune in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, regarded the work of giving preferential treatment as a regular political task. They stipulated preferential treatment measures for the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled soldiers who came to see a doctor, which was well received by the masses.
    Last year, people's communes and production teams in various localities continued to grant labor days to the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized veterans in accordance with policy regulations. According to incomplete statistics, in 1965, about 40 percent of the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled soldiers across the country enjoyed preferential labor days. At the same time, the state implemented regular and quantitative subsidies or temporary subsidies for the elderly and widowed families of martyrs, retired Red Army veterans, and demobilized veterans who could not participate in labor. The state also issued a large amount of special funds to help the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers in disaster-stricken areas and old revolutionary base areas to build houses. After receiving preferential treatment, the living standards of the vast majority of the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled demobilized soldiers in Zhucheng, Zaozhuang and other counties and cities in Shandong Province were equivalent to or even higher than those of local commune members.
    Various localities have also combined the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas with production and distribution work to conduct an in-depth review of the work of giving preferential treatment, summarized and promoted many good experiences in the work of giving preferential treatment, and commended a large number of advanced communes, brigades, organs, and schools in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. Measures were also taken to resolve the problems existing in the work.
    Under the cordial care of the Party and the government, the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized veterans continued to maintain and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, and have made contributions on all fronts. In 36 counties and cities including Nanxian and Yiyang City in Hunan Province, 7,443 families of martyrs and soldiers and demobilized veterans were rated as models in the counties and cities. In 34 counties and cities including Dongxing and Dayao Mountain in Guangxi, 10,691 people were rated as activists in socialist construction. Many families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized veterans were trusted by the people and elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels.

    突出政治，优抚工作取得新成绩
    过去一年，在党和政府的亲切关怀下，烈军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人继续保持和发扬了光荣的革命传统，在各条战线上作出了贡献。
    据新华社十九日讯　一九六五年全国各地优待、抚恤烈属、军属和革命残废军人、复员退伍军人的工作，取得了新的成绩。
    在优抚工作中突出政治，是过去一年工作中的重点。各地普遍向烈军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人进行了阶级教育、形势教育和国际主义、爱国主义教育。福建、四川、山东、河南四个省许多县、市在去年“八一”建军节期间，为烈军属和革命残废军人、复员退伍军人召开了各种会议，在会上向他们进行了上述教育。各地还特别注意组织烈军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人学习毛主席著作。陕西省合阳县的烈军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人中，出现一千多名学习毛主席著作的积极分子。广西马山县双目失明的残废军人韦世祥，坚持用盲文学习毛主席著作，还经常向青年、学生报告学习心得，受到人们的欢迎。哈尔滨市一个居民委员会的十一户军属学习毛主席著作后，提高了觉悟。原来他们很少参加社会活动，现在很多人担任了街道工作，一年来还集体参加公益性劳动四十多次。这十一户军属现在都被评为五好军属。
    过去一年，各地进一步加强了对优抚工作的领导，广泛地向干部、群众进行宣传教育，增强了人民群众的国防观念，
  “拥军优属，人人有责”的社会风尚得到进一步发扬。许多公社和生产大队成立优抚委员会、学校成立优抚小组，开展经常性的优抚活动。湖北省天门县华严湖公社卫生所把优抚工作当作一项经常性的政治任务，他们对前来看病的烈军属和残废军人规定了优待办法，得到了群众的好评。
    去年，各地人民公社生产队对烈军属、残废军人和复员退伍军人，继续按照政策规定，优待了劳动日。据不完全统计，一九六五年全国有百分之四十左右的烈军属和残废军人享受了优待劳动日。与此同时，国家对孤老烈属、退伍老红军和不能参加劳动的复员退伍军人实行了定期定量补助或临时补助。国家还发放了大批专款，帮助受灾地区和革命老根据地的烈军属和革命残废军人修建房屋。山东省诸城、枣庄等县、市的烈军属、残废复员军人得到优待后，绝大多数户的生活水平相当于当地社员或者还要高些。
    各地还结合城乡社会主义教育运动和生产、分配工作，对优抚工作进行了一次深入的检查，总结推广了许多优抚工作做得好的经验，表扬了大批拥军优属工作先进的公社、大队、机关和学校。对工作中存在的问题，也采取措施进行解决。
    在党和政府的亲切关怀下，烈军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人继续保持和发扬了光荣的革命传统，在各条战线上作出了贡献。湖南省南县、益阳市等三十六个县、市中，有七千四百四十三名烈军属、复员退伍军人被评为县、市的模范。广西东兴、大瑶山等三十四个县、市，有一万零六百九十一人被评为社会主义建设积极分子。还有许多烈军属和残废军人、复员退伍军人，受到人民群众的信赖，被选为各级人民代表大会代表。
