    Red in the Tarim, Dedicated to the Gobi Desert
    In June 1964, I responded to the Party's call to participate in construction in Xinjiang. At that time, I still carried a burden deep in my mind: After twelve years of schooling, wouldn't engaging in agricultural labor in Xinjiang be a "waste of talent"? In labor practice, I made many "foolish mistakes" and also received profound education. At the beginning, when weeding barnyard grass in the rice paddies, I pulled out the good rice seedlings, leaving the barnyard grass in the field. During rest, an old comrade asked me to pick a Hami melon from the field next door, but I picked a zucchini instead, which is used for cooking. Facing large tracts of rice, wheat, and cotton, I lacked the knowledge to plant them well, manage them well, and harvest them well.
    After repeatedly hitting snags in practice, the thought of "waste of talent" completely disappeared. I began to understand that knowledge comes from practice.
    Chairman Mao said: "Many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant relatively, and the knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes a little more than theirs." This is absolutely correct. In actual training, I changed my view of "knowledge," got rid of the superiority complex of intellectuals, felt more cheerful, and consciously transformed myself, learning humbly from the old comrades. In labor, blisters appeared on my hands, but I continued to wield the earth-cutting hoe. Gradually, I learned a lot of agricultural technical knowledge.
    Under the teaching of the Party and the Youth League organizations, I understood that contributing more mud, cutting more grass, and producing more grain meant contributing more to the revolutionary cause. After clarifying this principle, I felt more and more energetic. Under the cultivation of the Party, in September 1964, I honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party. In the future, I will definitely inherit the revolutionary tradition of self-reliance and hard struggle, and contribute my entire life to the construction cause of Xinjiang.

    红在塔里木　专在戈壁滩
    一九六四年六月，我响应党的号召到新疆参加建设，当时思想深处还背了一个包袱：念了十二年书，到新疆干农业劳动是不是“大材小用”？在劳动实践中，我出了不少“洋相”，也得到了深刻的教育。开始，在水稻田里除稗草，把好好的水稻拔掉了，却将稗草留在田里。休息时，老同志要我到隔壁田里采一只哈密瓜，我却采来了一只做菜吃的西葫芦。面对大片大片水稻、麦子、棉花，要把它们种好、管好、收好，更是缺乏知识。
    在实际中接二连三碰了钉子以后，“大材小用”的思想完全消除了。我开始懂得知识来自实践。
    毛主席说：“许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”这真是讲得再正确也没有了。在实际锻炼中，我改变了对“知识”的看法，打掉了知识分子的优越感，心情更加开朗，也就自觉地改造自己，虚心向老同志学习。在劳动中，手上打出了血泡，还是继续挥舞砍土镘。慢慢地，我学会了不少农业技术知识。
    在党、团组织的教导下，我懂得了多挑一些泥，多割一些草，多打一些粮食，就是为革命事业多出一份力量。弄清这个道理后，我感到越干越有劲。在党的培养下，一九六四年九月，我光荣地参加了中国共产党。今后我一定继承自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命传统，在新疆建设事业中贡献自己的一生。
