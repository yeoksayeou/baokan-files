    Passing Down the Tradition of Supporting the Army
    Grandma Sun's Sincere Love for the People's Soldiers, Young Women Treat Soldiers as Family
    It was the twelfth lunar month, the snow had just stopped, and the northwest wind was still howling. However, Sun Lanxin, a Communist Party member from Suoqian Village, had an idea: "It's time to wash the soldiers' quilts and clothes and mend their socks so they can have a clean New Year."
    That day, she led a group of young women to the barracks of a certain PLA company guarding the Bohai front to collect clothes for washing. Some soldiers were afraid of troubling the villagers, so they quickly washed their clothes as soon as they took them off. Strangely enough, some clothes and quilts that hadn't been washed yet had to be handed over to Grandma Sun when she came. She wouldn't be happy if they didn't give them to her to wash.
    Once, two new cadres came to the company and didn't understand Grandma Sun's temperament. When Grandma Sun came with a group of people, these two new cadres tried their best to decline. Once, twice, three times, Grandma Sun got angry and said, "Is it that you don't want us, the common people, to support the army? Don't want us parents to take care of our sons? If this continues, we'll be too clear about what belongs to whom, and our relationship will be broken."
    Grandma Sun joined the work of supporting the army and the front lines in 1947. At that time, she wove homespun cloth, made military shoes, and sewed sock bottoms. She often said, "We can't lose this tradition!" She has always attached great importance to this work and often promotes education to everyone.
    Last summer, while everyone was studying Chairman Mao's works, she gave another lesson on supporting the army and the front lines. That day, after someone finished reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and told the story of how the foreigner Bethune helped the Chinese revolution, she stood up with a very worn pair of socks in her hand and said, "Everyone look at these socks. Our young soldier patched them himself, but they were unwearable and taken apart again. The cloth is still hanging on them! Everyone has learned that Bethune helped our Chinese soldiers by treating their illnesses. Shouldn't we help our own soldiers by doing something?"
    "Today, they are soldiers for us and have come here. Can we, as parents and relatives, bear to see our own sons wear such socks?"
    These words were all reasonable. Therefore, when they arrived at the company, if a soldier wanted to "ambush" and was a little polite and aloof, she would severely scold them in the identity of a mother.
    That day, they collected several large piles and were washing them in the river ditch! Grandma Sun constantly reminded everyone: "The weather is cold and it's easy to freeze. If it freezes, don't twist the water anymore, be careful not to damage the comrades' things." Political Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Lin Renshi

    拥军传统往下传
    孙大娘一片真心爱护子弟兵，青年妇女们把战士当自家人
    腊月天，大雪刚停，西北风还在呼呼地刮。所前庄共产党员孙兰欣大娘却有个想法：“又该给战士们洗洗被子、衣服，补补袜子啦，让他们干干净净过个年。”
    这天，她就领着一帮青年妇女来到守卫在渤海前哨的解放军某连的营房搜衣服洗。有的战士怕麻烦乡亲，一换下衣服就赶紧洗了。说也怪，有的还没来得及换洗的衣服、被子，只要孙大娘一来，就不能不交给她。不拿给大娘洗，她老人家不愿意。
    记得，有一次连里来了两个新干部，不摸孙大娘的脾气。当大娘领着一帮人来了的时候，这两位新干部好赖推掉了。一次，两次，三次，大娘就生气了，她说：“是不要咱老百姓拥军是不是？不要咱当父母的照看一下儿子是不是？这样下去，咱们一家分得这样清，关系算断了。”
    孙大娘，一九四七年就参加了拥军支前工作。那时她织土布，做军鞋，纳袜底。她常说：“这个传统咱不能丢！”她一直很重视这项工作，经常向大伙宣传教育。
    去年热天，她趁大伙学毛主席著作的时间，又讲了一次拥军支前的课。那天，当别人读完《纪念白求恩》，讲了白求恩这个外国人帮助中国革命的故事以后，她手里提着一双很破的袜子，站起来发言了：“大家看着这双袜子，是我们小战士自己补了穿不上又拆了的，这布还在上面耷拉着哩！大家都学了白求恩帮我们中国的战士看病，难道我们不应该帮自己的战士做点事情！”
      “今天他们为咱们当兵，来到这里，难道我们做父母亲人的就忍心看着咱们自己的儿子穿这样的袜子？”
    这些话讲得句句在理。所以，她们到了连里，如果那个战士要想“打埋伏”，有一点客气见外的样子，她就用母亲身分狠狠责怪一顿。
    这天，她们又搜了几大堆，在河沟里洗呢！孙大娘还不时地叮嘱大家：“天气冷容易结冰，结了冰就再别扭水了，小心把同志们的东西给扭坏了。”解放军某部政治部　林人时
