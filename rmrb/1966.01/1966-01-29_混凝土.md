    Concrete

    When dealing with people and matters, always look at the mainstream.　　　　——Words of Instructor Zhang Xingcheng

    For the past few days, Zhang Xingcheng had been participating in the brigade's Party meetings, leaving him little time to manage affairs in the team. Unexpectedly, one evening, the brigade's quality inspector, returning from the construction site, told him, "One of the concrete pillars your team made is not up to par."
    "What's wrong with it?"
    "It has a 'dog hole.'"
    Quality accidents are the most taboo thing for oilfield construction workers. Upon hearing this, Zhang Xingcheng became uneasy and hurried back to the team headquarters. By then, it was already dark, with bright lights illuminating the construction site and figures flitting about. He rushed over and saw that the captain and the technician were together, along with all the workers of the team, surrounding the poorly constructed concrete pillar, searching for the problem and investigating the cause.
    Seeing the instructor returning, the captain greeted him, saying, "You're back just in time; we were about to hold an on-site meeting for criticism."
    "Criticize whom?" Zhang Xingcheng asked concernedly.
    "The Third Squad."
    Upon hearing this, Zhang Xingcheng frowned. First, the Third Squad had a total of fifteen people. This concrete pillar was small, at most the work of two people. How could they criticize the entire squad for this? Second, the Third Squad was the main force of their detachment. This squad had the most outstanding concrete workers, and the squad leader was an oilfield model worker. In the past, many arduous and complex tasks had been completed by relying on them, and no accidents had ever occurred. This time, an accident occurred, causing some losses to the state, which of course was not good and needed to be criticized. However, how to criticize it to achieve better results needed to be carefully considered. Third, from the perspective of the entire team, if something happened in one squad, although the workers in that squad had to take responsibility, the leadership was not without responsibility! Thinking of these things, Zhang Xingcheng suggested to the captain, "Criticism is necessary when accidents occur, but it's best to let the workers criticize themselves within the squad, as that would be more effective." The captain pondered carefully and felt that this was the right approach.
    The development of the matter was indeed like this; the meeting that evening was best conducted by the Third Squad themselves. It turned out that the concrete pillar had not been made well, not by ordinary workers, but by two of the best concrete workers in their squad—Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi. In the past, during the construction of the massive thermal power plant in the Yumen Oil Mine, they had both made names for themselves. After coming to the Daqing Oilfield, they had also performed outstandingly in many complex projects. As a result, their minds became somewhat muddled. When pouring the concrete pillar this time, they saw that the task was simple, thinking they could complete it with their eyes closed, and didn't take it seriously at all.
    "I should bear the primary responsibility for this accident," Squad Leader Zheng Farong began by making a painful self-criticism. It turned out that he had been too trusting of Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi, without strict requirements or timely inspections.
    Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi were even more remorseful. They had realized that a terrible thing—complacency—had arisen in their minds. They had caused losses to the state and tarnished the collective honor of the entire team. They were truly sorry to the Party and their comrades. At the time, Wang Futian said, "No one is to blame; it's all because of our complacency."
    Cao Dongyi was so saddened that he couldn't even say a word.
    The instructor was very happy to hear about this, thinking that as long as they recognized their mistakes, they would definitely correct them. He consulted with the captain and decided to have them re-pour the pillar.
    However, on the second evening, at a workers' meeting of thousands of people, the chief commander of the oil construction headquarters brought up the accident. The chief commander said, "What's going on with your Third Detachment? You can't even make a simple concrete pillar well. How can you strive for high speed and high standards in oilfield construction? Please tell us why!"
    At that moment, when Zhang Xingcheng saw this situation, he thought that the captain had only recently arrived, and the responsibility did not lie with him. It would be inappropriate for him to make a self-criticism. So, without waiting for the captain to step forward, Zhang Xingcheng ran up, saying, "I will make a self-criticism to the Party."
    At this, the workers in their detachment all lowered their heads.
    Zhang Xingcheng said, "This accident cannot be blamed on the workers. It is mainly the fault of us cadres, especially myself, for not implementing the ideology of quality as the core, not providing adequate technical briefings, and not inspecting during the pouring process. Afterward, we have already held a meeting and resolved to accept this lesson and guarantee high speed and high standards." Then he asked the workers of their detachment in a loud voice, "Does the Third Detachment have the confidence?"
    The workers understood very well: when the accident happened, the instructor was not even there. Now, when the leaders criticized them, the instructor took the responsibility upon himself. How could this not move everyone, and how could they not listen to the instructor? So, when Zhang Xingcheng asked everyone in a loud voice, almost everyone raised their heads and answered in unison, "Yes!"
    As soon as the meeting dispersed, the workers immediately came up and surrounded the instructor, some repeatedly making self-criticisms to him, others expressing their determination to him. The two best concrete workers in the Third Squad—Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi—were even more excited, saying, "As long as the leadership trusts us, we can guarantee high speed and high standards in any task in the future."
    The chief commander and Party secretary of the oil construction headquarters were very happy to see the great determination of the Third Detachment. Soon, they assigned a very urgent, important, and technically complex task to the Third Detachment—pouring the concrete for the forging furnace tip layer of the forging workshop in the main machinery plant. Zhang Xingcheng received this task and studied it carefully with the captain, concluding that other squads would have difficulty, except for the Third Squad. So, they called Squad Leader Zheng Farong and the best concrete workers Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi, and told them, "This time, you will truly be tested."
    "Please rest assured, Captain and Instructor," the three of them said almost simultaneously.
    Indeed, this was a tough battle. From the first day of pouring, they encountered continuous rainstorms, which made it tense and difficult. At that time, the chief commander and Party secretary were very worried, fearing that they would not be able to complete it, which would affect the arrangement of the entire project. They came to the construction site almost every day to see how things were going. Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi, the concrete workers in charge of this project, were even more focused and worked tirelessly, spending almost twenty-four hours on the construction site, either busy tamping or busy inspecting. In this way, they fought hard for seven days and finally completed the pouring. On the day the formwork was opened, the site was filled with people early in the morning, including the chief commander, the Party secretary, and representatives from other teams. Everyone held their breath and stared at the hands and feet of the carpenters. One piece, two pieces, until the last piece of wood was removed, and seeing that the concrete was smooth and flat, everyone couldn't help but cheer.
    Wang Futian and Cao Dongyi finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at this time. (Image attached)

专栏：指导员的故事

    混凝土
    常工
    对人对事，都要看主流。　　　　——指导员张兴成的话
    几天以来，张兴成一直在参加大队的党的会议，很少时间去管队上的事情。谁知，一天傍晚，从工地上回来的大队质量检查员对他说：“你们队里有个混凝土柱子打得不好。”
    “怎么不好。”
    “出了狗洞。”
    质量事故是油田建设工人最犯忌的事情。一听这话，张兴成不安起来，连忙赶回队部去。那时，天已经黑了，只见工地上灯光明亮，人影闪闪，他赶过去一看，原来是队长同技术员一起，带着全队的工人，正在围着那个打得不好的混凝土柱子，找问题，查原因。
    队长看见指导员回来了，迎上去说：“你回来的正好，我们正要开现场会批评呢。”
    “批评谁？”张兴成很关心。
    “三班。”
    一听这话，张兴成便皱起了眉头。第一，三班共有十五个人，这个混凝土柱子很小，顶多是两个人干的，怎么能因此而对全班进行批评呢！第二，三班是他们中队的主力班。这个班有着最优秀的混凝土手，班长又是全油田的标兵。过去许多艰巨复杂的任务都是依靠他们去完成的，从来也没出过事故。这次出了事故，给国家造成一些损失，当然不好，是需要批评的，但是怎样批评才能收到更好的效果，则要慎重考虑。第三，从全队来讲，一个班里出了事，虽然这个班里的工人要负责任，但是，领导也不是没有责任啊！想到这些，张兴成便对队长建议说：“出了事故，批评批评是需要的，但是，最好是以班为单位，让工人自己去批评自己，那样会收到更好的效果。”队长仔细地琢磨了一番，觉得这样做很对。
    事情的发展也正是这样的，那天晚间的会议，就是三班开得最好。原来他们没有把那个混凝土柱子打好，不是一般工人，而是他们班上两个最好的混凝土手——王福田和曹动义。过去，在玉门油矿巨大的热电站的建设中，他俩便同时出了名；来到大庆油田，又在许多复杂的工程中，干得很出色，这样，他俩的头脑便有些不清醒了。这次浇灌混凝土柱子的时候，他俩看到这项任务很简单，以为闭着眼睛也能完成，根本就没有把它放在心上。
    “这个事故的发生，我要负主要责任。”班长郑发荣首先沉痛地作了自我检查。原来，他对王福田和曹动义太放心了，既没有严格的要求，也没有及时的检查。
    王福田和曹动义更是沉痛，原来，他俩发现他们的脑子里产生了可怕的东西——骄傲自满情绪，既给国家造成了损失，又败坏了全队的集体荣誉，真是对不起党，也对不起同志们。当时，王福田就这样说：“这事谁也不怪，全怪我们有了骄傲自满情绪。”
    曹动义更是难过得连一句话也说不上来。
    指导员听到了这件事，心里很是高兴，心想只要他们认识了错误，就一定会改正错误，当时同队长商量了一下，决定他们重新再打那个柱子。
    然而，第二天的晚上，在举行上千人的职工大会上，油建指挥部的总指挥，把这次事故给提出来了。总指挥说：“你们三中队是怎么搞的。连一个一般的混凝土柱子都没打好，那怎能争取油田建设达到高速度、高水平，请你们说说理由吧！”
    那时，张兴成一见这个情况，心想，队长才来不久，责任不在队长的身上，要他检讨是不合适的。于是，没等队长走上来，张兴成就跑上去了：“我来向党检讨。”
    这时，他们队上的工人都把头低下去了。
    张兴成说：“这个事故不能怪工人，主要的是怪我们干部，特别是怪我自己，没有贯彻以质量为核心的思想工作，技术交底作的不够，浇灌中间也没检查。事后，我们已经开了会，决心接受这个教训，保证达到高速度和高水平。”接着他便向他们队上的工人高声地问道：“三中队有没有信心？”
    工人们心里很明白：事故发生的时候，指导员根本不在家，现在当领导上批评的时候，指导员又一个人把责任担当起来，这怎能不叫大家感动啊，又怎能不听指导员的话呀！所以，当张兴成高声向大家问的时候，几乎所有的人都仰起了头，齐声地回答：“有。”
    会议一散，工人们立刻上来把指导员团团围住，有的向他再三检讨，有的向他表示决心，三班最好的两个混凝土手——王福田和曹动义更激动地说：“只要领导上相信我们，今后不论什么样的任务，我们都能保证作到高速度高水平。”
    油建指挥部的总指挥和党委书记，看到三中队的决心很大，都很高兴。不久，便把一项十分紧急、重大，技术也极复杂的任务——浇灌总机厂锻工车间锻炉尖刀层的混凝土任务交给了三中队。张兴成接到这项任务，同队长仔细作了研究，认为除了三班以外，其他班都是有困难的，于是，他们便把三班班长郑发荣、最好的混凝土手王福田和曹动义找来，对他们说：“这回可要真的考验你们了。”
    “请队长指导员放心。”他们三个人几乎同时说出来。
    的确，这是一个硬仗。从浇灌的第一天开始，又逢到了连阴暴雨，又紧张，又困难。当时，总指挥和党委书记都很担心，害怕他们完不成，将会影响整个工程的安排，几乎天天都要到工地上来看看。负责这项工程的混凝土手王福田和曹动义，更是精神贯注，废寝忘食，几乎二十四小时都在工地上，不是忙着捣固，就是忙着检查。这样，奋战了七天，终于完成了浇灌。打开盒子板的那天，一早，现场里便站满了人，有总指挥、党委书记，还有其他队的代表。大家都屏着气在瞪着木工的手脚，一块、两块，直到最后的一块木板拿下来，看到混凝土都是又光滑又平整，大家不由得欢呼起来。
    王福田和曹动义到了这时也才松了口气，笑了。（附图片）
