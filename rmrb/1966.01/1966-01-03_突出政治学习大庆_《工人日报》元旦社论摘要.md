    1966 is a year of historical significance. The Third Five-Year Plan, eagerly anticipated by the people of the whole country, will begin to be implemented this year. This is a grand plan for developing the national economy. A five-year plan is judged by the first three years, and those first three years are judged by the first year. To achieve the Third Five-Year Plan in a faster, better, and more economical way, we must first fight well in 1966.

    To fight well in 1966, we need to work hard in many areas. Among the many tasks, the most important is to grasp the fundamental link of highlighting politics and realizing the revolutionization of enterprises. Highlighting politics means using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle.

    The purpose of running socialist enterprises is not only to meet the current needs of national construction and people's lives, and to support the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and oppressed peoples against the United States, but also to lay the foundation and prepare for the great cause of the future communist revolution. Therefore, socialist enterprises are not only factories, but also schools, which should produce both material products and spiritual products – people and experience. And arming the workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought and cultivating a working-class contingent with a high degree of communist consciousness and a considerable level of cultural and technical skills should be the primary task of the enterprises. Because without such a team that cannot be defeated, corrupted, or changed its colors, it will be impossible to build socialism faster, better, and more economically, let alone build communism.

    Highlighting politics and realizing the revolutionization of enterprises, how should it be done specifically? The Party Central Committee has instructed us: industry must rely on the Daqing spirit. The best specific way to highlight politics is to learn from Daqing. Daqing is an advanced banner on the industrial front, a living example of carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and building the country through diligence and thrift, and a good example of adhering to and implementing the general line. Of the thousands of experiences of Daqing, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental. What makes Daqing so valuable is not only that they have provided the country with abundant products and opened up the situation of self-sufficiency in oil, but more importantly, that through the great practice of the three major revolutionary movements and powerful political and ideological work, Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in the minds of cadres and workers, and changed people's thinking; it lies in the fact that they have creatively applied Mao Zedong Thought to production and construction work, and have embarked on a road of running Chinese-style socialist enterprises.

    In the past few years, many enterprises have learned from Daqing and achieved great results. This year, we must carry out the activities of learning from Daqing more widely and deeply, raise the banner of Daqing higher, and widely plant the banner of Daqing-style enterprises and Daqing-style workers. We must strive to ensure that every industry has Daqing-style enterprises, and every enterprise has Daqing-style workers, and gradually form a situation where red flags are flying. To achieve this, we also require leading organs at all levels and leading cadres of enterprises to first revolutionize their own thinking, take the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in learning from Daqing's experience, and bring out a contingent of workers who are both red and expert.

    突出政治学习大庆
    ——《工人日报》元旦社论摘要
    一九六六年，是具有历史意义的一年。全国人民热烈盼望的第三个五年计划，从今年起就要开始执行。这是一个宏伟的发展国民经济的计划。五年看三年，三年看头年。我们要多快好省地实现第三个五年计划，首先就要打好一九六六年这一仗。
    为了打好一九六六年这一仗，我们需要努力的方面很多。在许多工作中首先要抓住的，是突出政治、实现企业革命化这个根本环节。突出政治，就是用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    我们办社会主义企业的目的，既是为了当前国家建设和人民生活的需要，为了支持被压迫民族和被压迫人民反美革命斗争的需要，也是为今后伟大的共产主义革命事业打基础，作准备。因此，社会主义企业既是工厂，又是学校，既要出物质产品，又要出精神产品——出人，出经验。而用毛泽东思想武装工人头脑，培养出一支既有高度的共产主义觉悟，又有相当的文化技术水平的工人阶级队伍，则应当是企业的首要任务。因为，如果没有这样一支打不垮、腐蚀不了、永不变色的队伍，就不可能多快好省地建设社会主义，更谈不上建设共产主义。
    突出政治，实现企业革命化，具体地应当怎样做呢？党中央指示我们：工业要靠大庆精神。突出政治，最好的具体途径就是学习大庆。大庆，是工业战线上的先进旗帜，是发扬自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国革命精神的活典型，是坚持贯彻总路线的好榜样。大庆的经验千条万条，毛泽东思想红旗举得高是最根本的一条。大庆之所以可贵，不仅因为他们为国家提供了丰富的产品，打开了石油自给的局面，更可贵的，还在于他们通过三大革命运动的伟大实践，强大的政治思想工作，使得毛泽东思想在干部和职工的头脑里深深扎了根，改变了人的思想面貌；在于他们把毛泽东思想活学活用到生产建设工作中，走出了一条办中国式的社会主义企业的道路。
    几年来，很多企业学大庆，取得了很大成绩。今年，我们要更广泛、更深入地开展学习大庆的活动，把大庆的旗帜更高地举起来，把大庆式企业和大庆式工人的旗帜广泛地插起来。做到各行各业都有大庆式的企业，每个企业都有大庆式的工人，逐步形成红旗招展的局面。为了做到这点，又要求各级领导机关和企业的领导干部首先自己要做到思想革命化，带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头学大庆经验，带出一支又红又专的职工队伍来。
