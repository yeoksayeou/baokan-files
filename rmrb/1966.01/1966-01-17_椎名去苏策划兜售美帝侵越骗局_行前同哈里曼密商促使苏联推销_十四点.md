    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese Sato government's Foreign Minister, Shiina Etsusaburo, departed from Tokyo by plane on the evening of the 15th for a "friendly visit" to the Soviet Union, to strengthen current friendly relations and to serve the US imperialist "peace" deception on the Vietnam issue.
    It is reported that prior to his visit to the Soviet Union, Shiina held talks with US President's special envoy, Harriman, on the 7th. They agreed that during Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union, he should maintain close contact with Soviet government leaders and actively promote US President Johnson's fourteen-point proposal.
    Shiina also consulted with Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku on the 12th regarding the mission of this visit to the Soviet Union. Although the content of the discussions was not officially announced, according to Japan Broadcasting Corporation radio, they discussed in considerable depth how to encourage the Soviet Union to help resolve the Vietnam issue. The Associated Press reported that Shiina would ask the Soviet Union to help persuade the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in negotiations in order to "peacefully" resolve the Vietnam issue. Shiina also carried a personal letter from Prime Minister Sato to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kosygin on this issue.
    It is reported that during his visit to the Soviet Union, Shiina will also formally sign the Japan-Soviet Aviation Agreement and the Japan-Soviet Trade Agreement. During his talks with Soviet leaders, Shiina will also discuss the issue of returning the "Northern Territories," the issue of developing Siberia, and the issue of safe operations of North Pacific fisheries, and, depending on the circumstances, will also enhance "Japan-Soviet friendship" relations.
    Shiina will be in the Soviet Union for a week, and then visit West Germany.

    椎名去苏策划兜售美帝侵越骗局
    行前同哈里曼密商促使苏联推销“十四点”主张
    新华社十六日讯　东京消息：日本佐藤政府的外务大臣椎名悦三郎十五日晚间从东京乘飞机去苏联进行“友好访问”以加强目前友好关系并为美帝国主义在越南问题上的“和平”骗局效劳。
    据报道，椎名在访问苏联以前，曾在七日同美国总统特使哈里曼进行了会谈。他们商定在椎名访苏期间，要同苏联政府首脑紧密接触，积极推销美国总统约翰逊的十四点主张。
    椎名还在十二日同日本首相佐藤荣作就这次访问苏联的使命进行了磋商。官方虽未公布商谈的内容，但是，据日本广播协会电台透露，他们相当深入地讨论了如何推动苏联帮助解决越南问题。美联社说椎名将要求苏联帮助说服越南民主共和国参加谈判，以便“和平”解决越南问题。椎名还携带了佐藤首相就这个问题写给苏联部长会议主席柯西金的一封亲笔信。
    据报道椎名在访苏期间还要正式签署日苏航空协定和日苏贸易协定。椎名在他同苏联首脑会谈时还要商谈归还“北方领土”问题、开发西伯利亚问题和北洋渔业的安全作业问题，并看情况，还要增强“日苏亲善”关系。
    椎名将在苏联活动一个星期，然后去西德访问。
