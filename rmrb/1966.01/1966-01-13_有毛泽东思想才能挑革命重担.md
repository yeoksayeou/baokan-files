    Study Chairman Mao's works, first and foremost learn from three role models: Zhang Side's thought of wholeheartedly serving the people; Bethune's lofty internationalist spirit; and the Foolish Old Man's tenacity of not fearing difficulties and persevering to the end.
    Only With Mao Zedong Thought Can We Shoulder the Heavy Responsibility of Revolution
    Secretary of the Party Branch of Yongxin Seamless Steel Pipe Factory Zhao Xixiang
    A few years ago, modern revisionists broke their promises and attempted to make things difficult for us concerning special-shaped seamless steel pipes. However, their conspiracy went bankrupt. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the workers of our factory, like many fraternal factories, worked hard, relied on our own efforts, and produced special-shaped seamless steel pipes for the country. At present, our factory produces more than 170 varieties and specifications of special-shaped seamless steel pipes, partially meeting the needs of national construction.
    Our factory originally produced round steel pipes. When we started trial production of special-shaped steel pipes, the understanding of the cadres and workers was not entirely consistent. Some cadres said: "We have no technical data, no special equipment, and no specialized technicians. What are we relying on to do this?" Some workers also said: "Trial production of special-shaped steel pipes is not worthwhile. Trial production of new products will affect the production of old products, and indicators such as output, cost, and profit may not be completed. In this way, the title of advanced factory will not be secure."
    The Party branch conducted a discussion and believed that whether or not to trial-produce special-shaped seamless steel pipes was essentially a question of whether or not to dare to shoulder heavy responsibilities and whether or not to make revolution. This was not just a production task, but a concrete struggle against imperialism and revisionism. Our factory's conditions were indeed poor, but Chairman Mao taught us: The decisive factor in winning a war is not weapons, but people. Whether or not we can manufacture special-shaped steel pipes depends on people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Technical and material conditions can be prepared as we go. We decided to fully disclose the trial production task to the workers.
    We calculated two accounts with the workers and cadres: a political account and an economic account. We thoroughly explained the various tricks of imperialism and revisionism to hinder us. Everyone realized that accounting cannot only be done for the small account of one factory, but must be done for the large account of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The successful trial production of special-shaped steel pipes promotes China's socialist construction and is also a blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. Once we calculated the political account, we got rid of individualism and departmentalism in our minds, calculated the revolutionary ambition to work hard, and calculated the revolutionary power to oppose imperialism and revisionism.
    With a clear direction and great enthusiasm, a new product trial production team of four people was established. In less than half a year, special-shaped steel pipes began to be trial-produced.
    After the special-shaped steel pipes were put into production, more units needed them, and the requirements became higher. Under the new situation, some of our cadres developed new fears of difficulty. Some people adopted a "five accept, five do not accept" attitude towards tasks. That is: accept large quantities, do not accept small quantities; accept central tasks, unwilling to accept local tasks; accept high profits, do not accept low profits; accept easy tasks, do not accept difficult tasks; accept long delivery times, do not accept short delivery times.
    We, along with the workers, studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with these problems in mind. The workers had a deep understanding after studying "Serve the People." Everyone said that Comrade Zhang Side participated in the Long March and was injured. He did whatever the Party needed him to do and regarded charcoal burning as revolutionary work. Our production of special-shaped steel pipes is also serving the people and is also revolutionary work. What is it like to pick and choose?
    Everyone specifically implemented serving the people into production, believing that we should "fear not three things and achieve five things." That is, first, not fear difficulties; we should do what others do not do; second, not fear small quantities; as long as the country needs it, we should do it even if it is only one jin or one liang; third, not fear trouble; leave convenience to others and keep difficulties for ourselves. The five achievements are to satisfy users in terms of quality, variety, quantity, time, and price.
    In this way, we concretized shouldering heavy responsibilities and serving the people, no longer picking and choosing tasks, but actively going to the city and other places to find tasks and find "pressure." The workers said that "pressure" can be transformed into motivation, and it is glorious to shoulder heavy responsibilities for the revolution.
    The employees said: When learning Chairman Mao's works, first learn from three role models: Zhang Side's thinking of wholeheartedly serving the people; Bethune's lofty internationalist spirit; and the Foolish Old Man's perseverance and not being afraid of difficulties. Comparing ourselves with these three role models, we can see far and think far, and we will feel that we should shoulder heavier burdens and make more contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

    学毛主席著作，首先学三个榜样，张思德一心为人民服务的思想；白求恩崇高的国际主义精神；愚公不怕困难，坚持到底的韧劲。
    有毛泽东思想才能挑革命重担
    永鑫无缝钢管厂党支部书记　赵熙祥
    前几年，现代修正主义者背信弃义，企图在异型无缝钢管上刁难我们。但是，他们的阴谋破产了。在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我们厂职工同许多兄弟厂一样，奋发图强，自力更生，为国家生产出异型无缝钢管来了。目前，我们厂生产的异型无缝钢管，品种规格已达一百七十多个，部分地满足了国家建设的需要。
    我们厂原来是生产圆钢管的。在开始试制异型钢管的时候，干部和工人的认识也不完全一致。有的干部讲：“我们一无技术资料，二无专用设备，三无专门的技术人员，凭什么搞？”还有的职工说：“试制异型钢管不合算，试制新产品要影响老产品的生产，产量、成本、利润等指标可能完不成。这样，先进厂的称号保不牢了。”
    党支部进行了讨论，认为要不要试制异型无缝钢管，实质是敢不敢挑重担、要不要革命的问题；这不单是一项生产任务，而是具体的反帝反修的斗争。我们厂条件确实差，但毛主席教导我们：决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是人。能不能制造出异型钢管，决定的因素是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。技术和物质的条件，可以边做边准备。我们决定把试制任务全部向职工群众交底。
    我们和工人、干部一起算了两笔账：一笔政治账；一笔经济账。我们把帝国主义、修正主义刁难我们的种种勾当讲透，大家认识到算账不能只算一个厂的小账，要算中国革命和世界革命的大账。异型钢管试制出来了，促进我国社会主义建设，也是对帝国主义、现代修正主义一个打击。一算政治账，就算掉了头脑里的个人主义和本位主义，算出了发奋图强的革命志气，算出了反帝反修的革命力量。
    方向明，干劲大，四个人组成的新产品试制小组成立起来了。不到半年，异型钢管就开始试制出来了。
    异型钢管投产以后，需要的单位多了，要求也高了。在新的情况下面，我们有的干部又产生新的畏难情绪。有人对任务采取了“五接五不接”的态度。这就是：接数量多的，不接数量少的；接中央任务，不愿接地方任务；接利润高的，不接利润少的；接易做的，不接难做的；接交货时间长的，不接时间短的。
    我们带着这些问题，和工人一道学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。工人学了《为人民服务》，感受很深刻。大家说，张思德同志参加过长征，负过伤，党需要他干什么他就干什么，把烧炭作为革命工作来做；我们生产异型钢管，也是为人民服务，也是革命工作，挑挑拣拣象什么话。
    大家把为人民服务具体落实到生产上，认为应该“三不怕、五做到”。就是一不怕难，别人不做的我们要做；二不怕少，只要国家需要，一斤一两也要做；三不怕烦，把方便让别人，困难留自己。五做到就是在质量上、品种上、数量上、时间上、价格上做到用户满意。
    这样，我们就把挑重担、为人民服务具体化了，不再挑挑拣拣对待任务，而是积极到本市、到外地找任务，找“压力”。工人同志说，“压力”可以变动力，为革命挑重担是光荣的。
    职工们说：学毛主席著作，首先学三个榜样：张思德一心为人民服务的思想；白求恩崇高的国际主义精神；愚公不怕困难，坚持到底的韧劲。用这三个榜样对照自己，就看得远，想得远，就感到自己应当挑更重的担子，为中国革命，为世界革命作出更多贡献！
