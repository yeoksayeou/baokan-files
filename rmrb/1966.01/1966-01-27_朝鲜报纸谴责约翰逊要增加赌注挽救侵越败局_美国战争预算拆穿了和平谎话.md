    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 26th, the *Democratic Korea* published a commentary on the 26th, pointing out that the "budget plan" submitted by U.S. President Johnson to Congress on the 24th is an out-and-out "war budget." This budget once again proves that Johnson's cry for "seeking peace" is a huge lie. The commentary said that Johnson's submission of a record-breaking total budget revenue and expenditure and military spending plan to Congress shows that Johnson will use any means to salvage his disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The commentary said that Johnson also shamelessly clamored that "if the situation in Southeast Asia develops in a way that requires additional funding," he will further increase huge military expenditures and taxes. This is tantamount to openly announcing that in order to achieve his aggressive goals in Vietnam, Johnson will exploit the American people to the bone.
    The commentary concluded that no matter how many dollars Johnson invests in the Vietnam War, the heroic Vietnamese people will make the American aggressors pay a hundredfold price.

    朝鲜报纸谴责约翰逊要增加赌注挽救侵越败局
    美国战争预算拆穿了和平谎话
    据新华社平壤二十六日电  《民主朝鲜报》二十六日发表评论指出，美国总统约翰逊二十四日向国会提出的“预算计划”，是一个不折不扣的“战争预算”，这个预算再次证明，约翰逊所叫嚷的“寻求和平”，是天大的谎话。评论说，约翰逊这次向国会提出了一个创纪录的预算收支总额和军事费用支出计划，这说明约翰逊为了挽救它在侵越战争中的惨败，是不择一切手段的。
    评论说，约翰逊还无耻地叫嚷，“如果东南亚的事态发展得需要额外的经费”，他将进一步增加巨额的军费支出和税收。这等于公开宣布，为了达到在越南的侵略目的，约翰逊将在美国人民身上敲骨吸髓。
    评论最后指出，不管约翰逊把多少美元投入越南战争，英雄的越南人民都将使美国侵略者付出千百倍的代价。
