    Mai Xiande

    Engine room soldier Mai Xiande, in a battle to annihilate the Chiang bandit warships, suffered severe head injuries, became comatose, and was in critical condition. However, with superhuman perseverance and tenacious fighting will, he persisted in fighting in the engine room for three hours until victory. In the hospital, even when his consciousness had not fully recovered, when a nurse asked him, "Are you a soldier?" he could clearly answer: "Ready at any time to eliminate invading enemies." Only a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought can possess such great strength and create such miracles. This is an inspiring story, and also a paean to Mao Zedong Thought.
    Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are most capable of creating miracles!
    Isn't this a miracle? An engine room soldier, in a battle to strike at the Chiang bandit army, had shrapnel penetrate his right frontal lobe and lodge in his left frontal lobe, yet he continued to fight in the engine room for three hours. The medical personnel who participated in his treatment were all moved to say: this is indeed a miracle that medical science itself cannot explain, it can only be explained by the hard bones of the proletariat, and by the great power of Mao Zedong Thought.
    This soldier is the engine room soldier of the "Sea Hero Boat" – combat hero Mai Xiande.
    The event occurred in the early morning of August 6th last year. The battle to annihilate the Chiang bandit warships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" began. The "Sea Hero Boat," along with its brother ships, displayed the revolutionary spirit of courage to "see red with the bayonet" and directly approached the enemy ships. Engine room soldier Mai Xiande stood tall at the main engine control platform, secretly saying in his heart: guarantee the commander will have as much speed as he needs, and be sure to bite onto the enemy ships and eliminate them.
    The "Zhangjiang" was hit and was burning fiercely. At this moment, a stray bullet rushed into the engine room of the "Sea Hero Boat." Mai Xiande's forehead was blown open with a hole, shrapnel went in, and blood spurted out. He instantly lost consciousness. But his determined will to eliminate the enemy revived him. The deputy instructor bandaged his wound, spread a blanket on the floor, and pressed him down firmly. The sound of artillery fire was deafening, and the machines were running at high speed. Mai Xiande remembered studying Chairman Mao's works, and having written in his diary: "The purpose of war is to eliminate the enemy is the most important, preserving oneself is second. ... And the purpose of preserving oneself is also to better eliminate the enemy. Sacrificing oneself for the interests of the people is the most glorious." Right, not even afraid of death, what's there to fear about the injury, what's there to fear about the pain. Thinking of this, he felt strength surging through his whole body. When the deputy instructor turned to leave the engine room, he struggled to stand up and continued to stand at his combat post.
    The wound on Mai Xiande's forehead was bleeding, soaking the bandage, and increasingly sticking to the corner of his eye and hanging on his eyelashes. It was difficult for him to see anything. Relying on a set of "night tiger" skills that he had diligently practiced, Mai Xiande weaved through the violently swaying engine room, accurately reaching under the high-speed machines, and inspecting the spiderweb-like oil pipes and water pipes, each switch, and each joint, again and again. When he lifted a heavy hatch floor to inspect an oil valve at the bottom of the cabin, engine room soldier Chen Wanyi discovered him, re-spread the blanket, and forced him to lie down.
    The cannon fire was still roaring, the comrades were still fighting heroically with the enemy, how could Mai Xiande not fight! The hard bones of the class were harder than steel, and he stood up again, continuing to stand at his combat post. At this moment, what was he thinking? Perhaps he thought that this was the moment of testing, the moment of revenge, the moment of dedicating himself to his class! No, at this moment, there was only one clear idea in his mind: a revolutionary soldier must fight to the last minute, and resolutely eliminate the enemy.
    Hour after hour passed, Mai Xiande stood at his combat post!
    Perhaps too much blood had flowed, perhaps the shrapnel in his head had tortured him for too long, Mai Xiande's steps were unsteady, his movements were sluggish, but his combat nerve was still active, doing everything according to the habits of daily sailing. Thus, something incredible appeared: a person in a "comatose state" was able to inspect, among several machines, dozens of pipes, and thousands of screws, and find a screw the size of a finger that had been loosened by the vibration. Mai Xiande quickly went to find a wrench. The wrench was with Chen Wanyi, he insisted on taking it, and personally tightened the screw.
    Chen Wanyi pleaded with this heroic comrade to rest again, and suddenly saw him hold up two fingers. Chen Wanyi immediately understood that he was asking if both enemy ships had been eliminated! At this time, we had already won a complete victory and were already on our way back. Mai Xiande knew that we had won, and obediently lay back on the blanket.
    After the battle ended, Mai Xiande was sent to the hospital. When he was still in a coma, he could not speak or understand what others were saying. In order to test the recovery of his consciousness, the nurses often asked him questions on paper, and his answers were always confused. For example, the nurse wrote: "Mai Xiande, what is your father's name?" His answer was: "Answer: what is your father's name?" But when the nurse wrote: "Mai Xiande, are you a soldier?" he wrote, stroke by stroke: "Answer: ready at any time to eliminate invading enemies!" This was a soldier's answer in a coma, and also a soldier's most clear-headed answer! Among many other pieces of paper filled with irrelevant answers, we also found a piece of paper that read: "Mai Xiande is a combat hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy." This was the nurse's handwriting, but the four words "combat hero" were crossed out by Mai Xiande, and the three words "conscript soldier" were filled in next to it. What a good conscript soldier! The nursing record clearly stated "higher nerve activity disorder," but we clearly saw such a noble, broad, and clear spiritual realm!

    麦贤得

    轮机兵麦贤得，在一次歼灭蒋匪军舰的战斗中，头部负重伤，神志昏迷，生命垂危，但仍以超人的毅力和顽强的战斗意志，在机舱里坚持战斗达三小时直到胜利。在医院里，他的意识还没有完全恢复的时候，护士问他“你是个战士吗？”他却能清醒地回答：“随时准备消灭来犯的敌人”。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，才能有这样伟大的力量，才能创造出这样的奇迹。这是一个激动人心的故事，也是一曲毛泽东思想的颂歌。
    毛泽东思想武装了的战士，最能创造奇迹！
    这难道不是奇迹吗？有个轮机兵，在一次打击蒋匪军的战斗中，弹片穿透了右额叶插到左额叶，他却继续在机舱坚持战斗达三个小时。参加救治他的医务人员，都感动地说：这确是医学科学本身解释不了的奇迹，只有用无产阶级硬骨头来解释，用毛泽东思想的伟大力量来解释。
    这位战士就是“海上英雄艇”的轮机兵——战斗英雄麦贤得。
    事情发生在去年八月六日凌晨。歼灭蒋匪军舰“剑门号”和“章江号”的战斗打响了。“海上英雄艇”跟兄弟舰艇一起，发扬了“刺刀见红”的革命勇敢精神，直逼敌舰。轮机兵麦贤得挺立在主机操纵台，心中暗暗说：保证指挥员要有多大艇速就有多大艇速，一定要咬住敌舰，消灭敌舰。
    “章江号”被打得烧起熊熊烈火了，这当儿，一发流弹窜进“海上英雄艇”的轮机舱。麦贤得的前额被炸开一个洞口，弹片插了进去，鲜血喷涌，他登时失去了知觉。可是他那坚决消灭敌人的意志，却使他苏醒过来。副指导员给他包扎好伤口，在地板上铺了一张毯子，用力按他躺下。炮声在震天价响，机器在高速运转。麦贤得想起了平时学习毛主席著作，在日记上写过这样的话：“战争的目的消灭敌人是最主要的，保存自己是第二位。……而保存自己的目的，也是为了更好地消灭敌人。为人民利益而牺牲自己是最光荣的。”对，死都不怕，还怕什么伤势、怕什么疼痛。想到这里，他觉得浑身都增添了力量。等副指导员转身离开机舱，他就挣扎着站了起来，继续站在战斗岗位上。
    麦贤得额上那个伤口，鲜血淌着，渗透了绷带，并且越来越多地粘住眼角，挂在睫毛上。他很难看清什么了。麦贤得凭着一套苦练出来的“夜老虎”功夫，在剧烈摇摆的机舱里穿来绕去，准确地伸手摸进正在高速运转的机器底下，对那密如蛛网的油管和水管，那一个个开关，一个个接头，检查一遍又一遍。当他掀起一块沉重的舱底板，检查舱底的一个油阀时，轮机兵陈文乙发现了，又重新铺开毛毯，强迫他躺了下来。
    炮火还在猛烈吼叫，同志们还在和敌人英勇搏战，麦贤得能不战斗！阶级硬骨头比钢铁还硬，他又挺立起来，继续站在战斗岗位上。此刻，他想到了什么？也许他想到了这是考验的时刻，报仇的时刻，为自己阶级献身的时刻！不，此刻他头脑里只有一个鲜明的思想：一个革命战士一定要战斗到最后一分钟，坚决消灭敌人。
    时间一小时又一小时地过去了，麦贤得站在战斗岗位上！
    是血流得太多了吧，是脑袋里的弹片把人折磨得太久了吧，麦贤得的脚步不稳了，动作迟钝了，他那根战斗的神经却还活跃着，依着平日航行时的习惯做着一切。于是，难以令人置信的事情出现了：一个处在“昏迷状态”的人，竟然能在几台机器、几十条管路、千百个螺丝里，检查出一个只有指头大的螺丝被震松了。麦贤得连忙去找活动扳手，扳手在陈文乙那里，他硬把它要来，亲手把那颗螺丝重新拧紧。
    陈文乙又央求这位英雄战友休息了，忽然见他竖起两个指头，陈文乙立时就明白，他是在问，两条敌舰是否都消灭了啊！这时，我们已经全胜，早就在返航途中了。麦贤得知道我们已经胜利，顺从地躺回毛毯上了。
    战斗结束以后，麦贤得被送进了医院。当他还处在昏迷状态时，不会说话，也听不懂别人的话。护士们为了试验他的意识恢复情况，常常在纸上问他一些什么，他的回答总是错乱的。例如护士写道：“麦贤得，你的父亲叫什么名字？”他的回答是：“答：你的父亲叫什么名字？”但是当护士写道：“麦贤得，你是个战士吗？”他就一笔一画地写道：“答：随时准备消灭来犯的敌人！”这是一个战士在昏迷时的回答，也是一个战士最清醒的回答！在另外许多写满答非所问的纸片里，我们还发现一张纸片上写着：“麦贤得是中国人民解放军海军战斗英雄”，这是护士的笔迹，但“战斗英雄”四个字被麦贤得涂掉了，旁边填上“义务兵”三个字。好一个义务兵啊！护理记录上明明写着“高级神经活动障碍”，可我们却明明看到一个多么崇高，多么开阔，多么明朗的精神境界！
