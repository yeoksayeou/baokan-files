    We Must Win Honor for the Working Class
    Pan Ayyao, Veteran Worker of Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory
    Someone asked me: “Master Pan, how did you manage to produce those oddly shaped special seamless steel tubes?”
    I said, it looks complicated, but it's simple to explain. We made the special steel tubes by listening to Chairman Mao's words, and by competing with imperialism and modern revisionism.
    The Party branch assigned me and three other comrades to be responsible for the trial production of special steel tubes. In the past, we only knew how to produce round steel tubes. Square, flat, triangular, and all sorts of other special steel tubes, we had never even seen them, let alone produced them.
    Not long after our initial trial production of several types of special steel tubes, the Party branch secretary and I visited an agricultural machinery research institute. We saw the comrades at the institute going to great lengths to piece together two angle irons and weld them into a square tube. The comrades at the agricultural machinery institute explained that these were originally made with imported special seamless steel tubes, but now the revisionists are "strangling" us and refuse to sell them to us. Hearing this almost made our stomachs explode with anger. Modern revisionists are bullying us like this. As a worker who produces seamless steel tubes, am I, Old Pan, supposed to swallow this insult? No! We must win honor for the Chinese working class, win honor for the 650 million Chinese people. We must take on even the heaviest burden!
    Taking on heavy burdens means taking on difficulties. In the process of trial-producing special steel tubes, we encountered many difficulties. Whenever we encountered seemingly insurmountable difficulties, I would think of Chairman Mao's teachings. In 1950, I and everyone else successfully trial-produced China's first seamless copper tube and gloriously attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, where I met our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught us that when our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, they must see the light, and they must increase our courage. Thinking of these words, I was filled with strength. The trial production of special steel tubes is a struggle with imperialism and modern revisionism. No matter what the difficulties, they cannot defeat the Chinese workers. We must compete with revolutionary spirit!
    If we don't have equipment, we will make it ourselves; if we don't have experience or information, we will find it ourselves! A scientific research unit needed a deep-fried dough stick-shaped steel tube. The surface of the steel tube had to be twisted like a deep-fried dough stick. No one could come up with a ready-made solution for how to produce this kind of steel tube! I thought: Do foreigners have two heads and four hands? No! We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we can definitely do it, and we can do it even better. Later, I cooperated with a veteran metalworking master, improved the mold, and finally produced the deep-fried dough stick steel tube.
    Imperialism and modern revisionism cannot bully us! We Chinese working class have this kind of backbone and this kind of ambition. As long as the revolution needs it, no matter how complicated the steel tube, we can find a way to make it!

    一定要为工人阶级争气
    永鑫无缝钢管厂老工人　潘阿耀
    有人问我：“潘师傅，你们是怎样把怪形怪状的异型无缝钢管制成功的？”
    我说，看来复杂，说来简单，异型钢管是我们听毛主席话做出来的，是同帝国主义和现代修正主义争气争出来的。
    党支部指定我和另外三个同志负责异型钢管试制工作。我们几个人过去只会生产圆钢管，方的、扁的、三角型的等等各种各样异型钢管，不要说生产，见也没见过。
    我们初步试成几种异型管不久，有一回，党支部书记和我们一道去访问一个农业机械研究所，看到农机所同志费很大的劲才把两根三角铁拼在一起，焊成方方的管子。农机所同志介绍说，这些本来是用进口的异型无缝钢管做的，现在修正主义“卡”我们，不肯卖给我们了。一听这些话，真要把人的肚皮气炸了。现代修正主义者这么欺侮我们，我老潘是生产无缝钢管的工人，难道咽得下这口气吗？不行！一定要为中国工人阶级争气，为六亿五千万中国人争气，再重的担子也要挑起来！
    挑重担，也就是挑困难。我们试制异型钢管过程中，碰到的困难真不少。一遇到看来是无法克服的困难时，我就想起毛主席的教导。一九五○年，我和大家一起试制成功我国第一根无缝铜管，光荣地出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席教导我们，我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。一想到这些话，我就浑身是劲。试制异型钢管是同帝国主义、现代修正主义的一场斗争。无论什么困难，也难不倒中国工人，革命的气一定要争！
    没有设备，我们自己造；没有经验、没有资料，我们自己闯！有个科研单位要一种油条形钢管。钢管的表面要绞得象油条似的。这种钢管怎么生产，谁也拿不出现成的办法！我想：难道外国人有两个脑袋、四只手吗？没有！我们有毛泽东思想武装，肯定可以搞出来，而且搞得更好。后来，我和金工老师傅合作，改进了模具，终于把油条钢管制出来了。
    帝国主义和现代修正主义想欺侮我们是办不到的！我们中国工人阶级就是有这种硬骨头，有这样的志气，只要革命需要，不论是多复杂的钢管，我们也能想出办法把它搞出来！
