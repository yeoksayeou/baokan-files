Edition: 3

    Editor's Note: Why was Mai Xiande, a turbine soldier of the "Hero Boat" of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Navy, so brave in the fierce naval battle? Why was he so tenacious in fighting against his injuries? His excerpts from his study notes on Chairman Mao's works, "Dedicate Red Hearts to the People, Fill Our Hearts with Hatred to Kill the Enemy," answers this question. Strive to study Chairman Mao's works and serve the people of our country and the people of the world wholeheartedly, and we will not be afraid of sacrifice, and we will understand that sacrificing for the people is the most glorious. We can clearly see from Mai Xiande's notes that it was Mao Zedong Thought that inspired his fighting spirit, strengthened his confidence, and gave him unparalleled combat effectiveness.

    Like Lei Feng's and Wang Jie's diaries, Mai Xiande's study notes shine with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a living textbook for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and a guarantee to dedicate oneself to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    Mai Xiande has been in the army for less than two years. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, his mind is so broad, his thoughts are so noble, and his actions are so brave and tenacious. It eloquently shows that arming soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought makes them progress the fastest, have the highest consciousness, be the bravest, the smartest, fear neither heaven nor earth, and wholeheartedly serve the revolution. Now, American imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, constantly carrying out war provocations against our country, and attempting to impose war on the people of our country. We must highly promote the proletariat revolutionary hard-bone spirit of the People's Liberation Army, heighten our vigilance, be ready for battle, and beat the invading enemy until their heads are broken and they return defeated.

    The excerpts from Mai Xiande's notes on studying Chairman Mao's works published in this newspaper today were compiled and edited by the *People's Liberation Army Daily*, and the subheadings in the article were also added by the *People's Liberation Army Daily*.

    (1) Study Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, and work hard on the word "use"

    I deeply realize that in order to grow and progress, and to do more work for the Party, I must seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. I must seize every moment to study and resolutely achieve studying, thinking, correcting, and applying simultaneously.
                                (February ×, 1964)

    I deeply realize that to make revolution, it is impossible not to study Chairman Mao's works. Only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as our guide can we avoid taking the wrong path. Only by arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought can we do a good job in revolutionary work, make fewer mistakes, and overcome all difficulties.
                                (Month ×, 1964)

    We must learn from Lei Feng in studying Chairman Mao's works in a down-to-earth manner, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must learn from him to compare our shortcomings with others' strengths. We must learn from him to be willing to be a pine on a high mountain rock, not a willow on a lakeside riverbank, and to be willing to be tempered in the storm, not to live our lives in peace and quiet.
                                (February ×, 1964)

  Someone asked me, what are you a soldier for? I said, to serve the people and defend the motherland. I must strengthen my study of Chairman Mao's works in the future, transform my thinking, proceed from reality, and wholeheartedly serve the people and defend the people of the whole country and the whole world.
                                (June ×, 1964)

    (1) Strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, go to Chairman Mao's works with problems;
    (2) Respect leaders and unite with comrades;
    (3) Be active and proactive in work;
    (4) Be calm when encountering difficulties and dare to overcome difficulties;
    (5) Be able to withstand tests in difficult and complex situations;
    (6) Strive to be a "Five Good" soldier, and do not consider family matters.

    The above points must be worked hard on to improve ideological awareness and wholeheartedly serve the people.
                                (July 3, 1964)

    Chairman's writings are worth more than gold, the more you learn, the more you realize the truth of Marxism.
    Teach me to love and hate clearly, teach people to become more and more intelligent.
    I joined the army for the truth, dedicating my red heart to serving the people.
    Willing to be a revolutionary screw, guarding the sea frontier and annihilating the enemy.
                              (August 15, 1964)

    "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the significant marks distinguishing us from other political parties. We have said that a house should be swept frequently, otherwise it will be filled with dust; a face should be washed frequently, otherwise it will be covered with dust." ... I still have dirty things on me, and I must quickly study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, sweep away the unclean things on me, so that I can be a good ordinary soldier.
                              (July ×, 1964)

    Chairman Mao said: "We should use our brains to think carefully about everything. As the saying goes: 'When you frown, a plan comes to mind.' This means that thinking more brings wisdom. To remove the strong blindness in our Party, we must advocate thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and develop the habit of analysis." This teaches me that in work and study, I should use my brain more, not work blindly, and have working methods. I should also think about it, learning should not be rote memorization of articles, but should have the spirit of thinking, analysis, and research. In this way, fewer accidents and fewer mistakes will occur in the work process.
                                (October 4, 1964)

    (2) Dedicate one's life to the Chinese people and the people of the world, and be a successor to the communist cause

    After studying the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," it has given me great inspiration and education. Bethune came to China from thousands of miles away to help China resist Japan, and regarded China's liberation cause as his own cause. Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his extreme responsibility for his work, his extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people, and his constant pursuit of perfection in his medical skills. ... I am a naval soldier, and under the cultivation and education of the Party, I should do a good job and regard the revolutionary cause as my own business, proceeding from the interests of the people... But my learning is limited to a smattering of knowledge, and I am not full of enthusiasm for my comrades. I must learn the glorious deeds of Comrade Bethune in the future.
                                (June ×, 1964)

    Comrade Zhang Side died for the interests of the people, and his death was the most glorious and greatest. ... After studying this (article), I must obey the Party's assignment. Wherever the Party assigns me, I will go to work there. As long as it is beneficial to the people, I will definitely do it, and truly serve the people!
                              (July ×, 1964)

    I repeatedly studied "Serve the People," ... What about these five words for me? I should correct my service attitude. ... Ensure that personal problems are put aside and focus on the general review. Wherever I am assigned to work in the future, I will resolutely obey the organizational assignment. The work assigned to me by the Party is my aspiration. Resolutely be of one heart with the Party, and go wherever the Party points. We must learn from Comrade Zhang Side and contribute our lives to the interests of the people. I will definitely fight to the end for the revolutionary cause.
                              (December ×, 1964)

    After re-studying the article "Serve the People," I feel that being a revolutionary soldier, doing any kind of work, and working in any place are all for the revolution and for serving the people. I am currently being transferred to a new ship, but it is also for the revolution, but the division of labor is different. Although I have not left yet, but staying here for a day, I must do a good job on this day. This is suitable for our revolutionary team and suitable for the people.
                                (July ×, 1965)

    For the needs of combat, I was transferred to study diving this time, and was appointed as the leader of the diving training class. I felt a heavy responsibility and arduous task for the first time. Originally, I had difficulties in learning, and in addition, I was asked to be the class leader, so how can I do a good job in the class? Through studying Chairman Mao's work "Unite the Whole Party and Fight to Achieve the Party's Tasks," I deeply felt that as long as we mobilize the masses, unite the masses, and jointly do a good job in the class, we can better complete this arduous task.
                            (June 21, 1965)

    Every one of our soldiers who does not understand exploitation does not understand revolution. Although I grew up in happy days, my parents lived a painful life in the old society. After liberation, the people lived a happy life under the leadership of the Party, but the domestic reactionary elements have not been completely eliminated, and they are trying every means to seize our power and lead us to the dark road. ... I (must) firmly stand on the class stand and diligently serve the people.
                              (January 18, 1965)

    I restudy "Combat Liberalism," and recalling it, it is fundamentally in conflict with Marxism to be a Marxist to others and a liberalist to oneself. What is even more serious is that objectively (it) aids the enemy, and the enemy likes our internal existence of liberalism.... We must be loyal to the country, to the revolution, and to the people, and individual interests must be subordinate to collective and revolutionary interests, and at any time and any place consolidate the connection between the Party and the masses... In the future, no matter what difficult and complex environment I am in, I must be able to withstand the test. As long as it is beneficial to the revolution and the people of the motherland, I will definitely fight to the end.
                                  (September ×, 1964)

    I have become a naval soldier serving the people, and I should be diligent and thrifty and support socialist construction. Therefore, I will definitely not waste money in the future, and I must enthusiastically help some comrades who have difficulties at home, so that they can better serve the people. Do not waste food in every meal, and compare the life of the revolutionary predecessors of the 25,000-mile Long March with the life I live today, to better serve the people and save more materials to support socialist construction.
                                (June ×, 1964)

    Once, I lost oil and was criticized by the electrical and mechanical sergeant. ... I immediately looked for Chairman Mao's works to study. Chairman Mao said: We want to carry out large-scale construction, but our country is a very poor country. This is a contradiction, and comprehensively and persistently practicing thrift is the way to solve this contradiction.

    I feel that the oil I wasted was produced by the hard work of the working people. I was also born in a labor (family). If the fruits of my labor were wasted by others at will, how would I feel? A drop of oil is a drop of sweat from the working people. We are soldiers to serve the people and are the people's orderlies. Wasting the fruits of the labor of the working people at will means not proceeding from the interests of the people.
                              (January 13, 1965)

    "Five Unforgettables" to be a good red successor:
    (1) Never forget the past, never change its nature;
    (2) Never forget that revolutionary (fruits) are hard-won;
    (3) Never forget that there is class struggle;
    (4) Never forget to make revolution;
    (5) Never forget the collective.
                              (July ×, 1964)

    One, recall the bitterness of the old society, look at the sweetness of today, and ask yourself if you have forgotten your roots.
    Two, recall that the revolutionary fruits are hard-won, look at today's class struggle situation, and ask yourself if you have been a good successor.
                                (August ×, 1964)

    Succession must succeed to:
    (1) The proletarian class.
    (2) The class that will make revolution to the end.
    (3) The class of our army's fine traditions.
    (4) The class of class struggle and building socialism.
    (5) The class for realizing communism.
                                (August ×, 1964)

    (3) Fear neither heaven nor earth, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory

    Through studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," I was greatly educated. I must overcome all difficulties in the future, not be afraid of the sun, not be afraid of wind and rain, not be afraid of pain, not be afraid of fatigue, and learn light weapons shooting skills to better eliminate the enemy.
                                (May ×, 1964)

    Chairman Mao said: We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things that we do not understand, and we must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are), take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. ... In my usual professional studies, I also encountered many difficulties, and some things I could never learn... In the future, I must humbly learn from comrades who understand, no matter who they are, I am willing to take them as teachers, and better learn all the skills to dedicate myself to the motherland.
                                  (August ×, 1964)

    Currently, I am starting to study the chapter on the variable direction clutch. When I first heard the instructor and some comrades say that this chapter was the most difficult and the most important, I was a little scared, afraid of not learning well, and afraid of difficulties. In such a situation, I had to open Chairman Mao's works to find the answer. Yugong was an old man who could move the two mountains blocking his way home. Could it be that I am scared by the current little difficulty? ... I should learn from Yugong's spirit, dare to overcome difficulties, and fight against difficulties.
                                  (August ×, 1964)

    After returning from this sea voyage, I had some ideological fluctuations. Because the wind and waves were particularly large during this sea voyage, my whole body was particularly tired, and I felt weak in my limbs and could not eat. So I wanted to return to work on land. This problem has not been resolved for a while, so I had to look for answers in Chairman Mao's works... Through studying the article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," I was greatly encouraged and educated. I thought, I am a young man and a revolutionary soldier. For a revolutionary soldier, he is not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, not afraid of thousands of dangers. This is the fine tradition of our army. ... Therefore, I must train hard in the future, work with peace of mind, and be tempered into a strong revolutionary soldier in the storm. No matter what the wind and rain, in the most difficult days, I must be able to withstand the test.
                                (January 9, 1965)

    I re-studied the article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which added infinite strength to me. I should have the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, overcoming difficulties, enduring hardship and standing hard work, and have the confidence to persevere (to) victory. ... Although we are seasick and vomit when we go to sea, as long as we exercise more, we may not be seasick today; if we are seasick again tomorrow, we will exercise again until we are not seasick.
                                  (January 9, 1965)

    I participated in (maritime) operations for the first time. In this operation, I encountered many difficulties. The wind and waves were relatively large, and the warship was constantly swaying, which made people dizzy and vomit. ... When encountering difficulties, I had to find Chairman Mao's works to solve them. Chairman Mao said that we are working and struggling to solve difficulties, and the more difficult places are the places we want to go, this is a good comrade. At present, difficulties are in front of you, see if you can bear it, can you overcome it, that is, when you are tested. Can you withstand the test in the face of this difficulty? Can you establish the strongest ambition in the big storm? For a true revolutionary soldier and a true good comrade, no matter how big the difficulties are, no matter how complex the situation is, and under the conditions of thousands of difficulties and dangers, they can be overcome and can withstand the test. Since I want to become a true revolutionary, I must do this, and I must overcome difficulties and fight against difficulties. Only by fighting can there be victory.
                              (February 18, 1965)

    (4) Never forget class struggle, and be ready to eliminate all invading enemies at any time

    The article "On the Chongqing Negotiations" exposed the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek group - false peace negotiations. All reactionaries in the world are unwilling to put down their bloody knives until they die. Therefore, we should unite the proletarians of the world and jointly overthrow all the enemies in the world. And we must realize that the world's progress and bright future are tortuous on the revolutionary (road), and there are still many obstacles, and we must overcome various difficulties. To make revolution, we must be prepared to take a tortuous road, and do not be greedy for cheap... At present, American imperialism has ignited war in our brother country. We cannot be careless, we must always be vigilant, and smash all invading aggressors.
                                (October ×, 1964)

    Chairman Mao told us: "The purpose of war is nothing else but 'preserve oneself, eliminate the enemy'," and "in the purpose of war, eliminating the enemy is the main thing, and preserving oneself is the second thing, because only by eliminating a large number of enemies can one effectively preserve oneself." Therefore, we must practice (good) skills in killing the enemy in order to better preserve ourselves. But what is the purpose of preserving oneself? It is to better kill the enemy, defend our motherland and people, and build socialism... For the sake of the people's interests, we are not afraid of sacrificing ourselves, and sacrificing ourselves is the most glorious.
                                (June ×, 1964)

    Through studying the chapter "The Purpose of War Is to Eliminate War," I understand what is a just war and an unjust war. Just like the current American imperialism invading Vietnam and setting fire on Vietnamese land, this is an unjust war. The Vietnamese people want to stand up and raise the banner of just war in order to defend their motherland, defend their hometown, and in order to make the people live a peaceful life. This is a just war. American imperialism forced them to fight, forcing the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people must do this for their own survival and to live a free life.

    It also made me understand: the real purpose of joining the army to make revolution and fight, and how to eliminate the enemy. In particular, at present, American imperialism has ignited war in fraternal Vietnam. Every one of our revolutionary soldiers must support Vietnam and prepare for combat. When the battle drum sounds, and the order is given, pick up the gun without hesitation and run to the battlefield. Kill the enemy with class hatred, and show no mercy!
                                (August ×, 1964)

    Sharpshooter
    One shot takes down Huang Shiren,
    Two shots take down Chiang Kai-shek,
    Three shots take down the American devil,
    Four shots take down all the running dogs.
                                (Month ×, 1964)

    "'It's terrible' and 'It's very good'," through the study of this chapter, I have made it clear that we have risen to make revolution, overthrow the three major enemies, and the people have gained a free life. This is very good for the people, but it is terrible for American imperialism. Because they stand on the top of the people, they must exploit the people, oppress the people, and call the people slaves, so that they can live a good life. Chairman Mao told us that if all reactionaries say bad things about us, we are doing the right thing; if they say good things about us, then we are doing the wrong thing. We should keep Chairman Mao's words in mind. We must be vigilant, not forget that there is still class struggle, and hold high the banner of Mao Zedong to fight against all class enemies who destroy socialism and damage the interests of the people.
                                (September ×, 1964)

    The Central People's Broadcasting Station issued news that China conducted an atomic bomb experiment at 15:00 on October 16, 1964, and issued a statement on the first explosion. This atomic bomb explosion is of great significance. It is to defend national defense, defend the exploited and oppressed people all over the world, and is used to oppose the use of nuclear weapons by American imperialism.
                  (October 17, 1964, at 5:00 a.m.)

    We should keep class struggle firmly in mind, and unless all reactionaries in the world are eliminated, there can be no class struggle. If we abandon class struggle, the reactionaries will take advantage of the loopholes to seize power. In this way, our country may become a revisionist country, and the people will suffer and return to the dark road. What a dangerous thing this is!
                              (November ×, 1964)

    Studied "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," ... We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words, as long as the enemy exists, there is the possibility of war. At present, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have not been eliminated, and war is bound to exist. Therefore, we must hold the revolutionary banner higher, stand firm, not be paralyzed, and carry the revolution through to the end, so that the motherland will never change color.
                              (February 12, 1965)

    Through studying the article "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," I have further improved my understanding. ... At present, American imperialism has burned the flames of war to our side, and Chiang Kai-shek is also taking the opportunity to make trouble with the power of American imperialism. Therefore, I must do all the preparations for war and implement all the work on the word "fight", so that it can be started and hit accurately, and the enemy will not be caught off guard when they come. In this way, all the enemies in the sky, sea and land will be wiped out. I must make three preparations: First, fight the American imperialist aggressors; second, fight Chiang Kai-shek; third, aid Vietnam and resist America. This is my obligation. I will definitely contribute all my strength, (even) my life. As long as I am still breathing, I will definitely fight on and will never yield to the enemy, and resolutely liberate the suffering working people.

专栏：

    掏尽红心为人民  满怀仇恨杀敌人
    ——麦贤得学习毛主席著作笔记摘抄
    编者按：解放军海军某部“英雄艇”轮机兵麦贤得，在激烈的海战中为什么那样英勇？在同创伤作斗争中为什么那样顽强？他的学习毛主席著作笔记摘抄《掏尽红心为人民，满怀仇恨杀敌人》回答了这个问题。努力学习毛主席著作，全心全意为我国人民和全世界人民服务，就不怕牺牲，就懂得为人民而牺牲是最光荣的。我们从麦贤得的笔记中清清楚楚地看到，是毛泽东思想鼓舞了他的斗志，加强了他的信心，使他产生了无比坚强的战斗力。
    同雷锋、王杰的日记一样，麦贤得的学习笔记通篇闪烁着毛泽东思想的巨大光辉。这是一篇活学活用毛主席著作的活教材，是一篇献身于中国人民和世界人民革命事业的保证书。
    麦贤得入伍还不到两年，在毛泽东思想哺育下，胸怀就这样宽广，思想就这样高尚，行动就这样英勇顽强。它雄辩地说明了，用毛泽东思想武装战士，他们的进步就最快，觉悟最高，最勇敢，最聪明，天不怕，地不怕，一心一意为革命。现在，美帝国主义正在疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，不断地对我国进行战争挑衅，企图把战争强加到我国人民头上。我们要高度发扬人民解放军的无产阶级革命硬骨头精神，提高警惕，严阵以待，把敢于来犯的敌人，打得头破血流，有来的无回的。
    本报今天发表的麦贤得学习毛主席著作笔记摘抄，是《解放军报》整理编辑的，文中的小标题也是《解放军报》加的。
    （一）带着深厚的阶级感情学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫
    我深切地认识到，要想成长进步，要为党做更多的工作，就必须认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。我一定要抓紧点滴时间学习，坚决做到边学边想边改边用。
                                （一九六四年二月×日）
    我深深体会到，要革命不学毛主席著作不行。只有以毛主席的思想为指针，才不会走错路。只有用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，才能把革命工作干好，才会少犯错误，战胜一切困难。
                                （一九六四年×月×日）
    我们要学习雷锋那样踏踏实实地学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。要学习他以自己的短处来对照别人的长处。要学习他那样愿做高山岩石之松，不做湖岸河边之柳，愿在暴风雨中艰苦奋斗锻炼出来，不愿在平平静静的日子过自己一生。
                                （一九六四年二月×日）
  有人问我，你当兵为的是什么？我说为人民服务、保卫祖国。我今后一定加强学习毛主席著作，改造自己的思想，从实际出发，做到全心全意为人民服务，保卫全国、全世界人民。
                                （一九六四年六月×日）
    （一）加强学习毛主席著作，带着问题去找毛主席著作；
    （二）对领导要尊重，对同志要团结；
    （三）在工作中积极主动；
    （四）碰到困难要沉着，敢于克服困难；
    （五）在艰苦复杂情况下要经得起考验；
    （六）要力争当五好战士，家中之事，不必考虑。
    以上几点一定要苦战，提高思想觉悟，全心全意为人民服务。
                                （一九六四年七月三日）
    主席著作胜千金，越学越觉主义真。
    教我爱憎倍分明，教人越学越精灵。
    为了真理来当兵，掏尽红心来为民。
    甘当革命螺丝钉，坚守海疆歼敌人。
                              （一九六四年八月十五日）
    “有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。我们曾经说过，房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。”……我目前身上还有脏的东西，我必须赶快活学活用毛主席著作，扫除身上不清洁的东西，才能做好普通一兵。
                              （一九六四年七月×日）
    毛主席说：“凡事应该用脑筋好好想一想。俗话说：‘眉头一皱，计上心来。’就是说多想出智慧。要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”这教育我在工作和学习中，应该多动脑筋，不要蛮干，要有工作方法。还应该想一想，学习应不死背条文，要有思索、分析、研究的精神。这样在工作过程中才（能）少发生事故，少犯错误。
                                （一九六四年十月四日）
    （二）为全中国人民和全世界人民献出一生，当共产主义接班人
    学习《纪念白求恩》这篇文章后，对我的启发和教育很大。白求恩为了帮助中国抗日，不远万里来到中国，把中国的解放事业当作自己的事业。白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在对工作极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱，对自己的医疗技术总是精益求精。……我是个海军战士，在党的培养教育下，应该好好的干，把革命事业当作自己的事情，从人民利益出发……但我学习满足一知半解，对同志不是满腔热忱。今后一定把白求恩同志的光荣事迹学到手。
                                （一九六四年六月×日）
    张思德同志为人民利益而死，死得最光荣最伟大。……学习这篇（文章）以后，我一定要服从党的分配，党分配我到哪里，我就到那里工作，只要有利于人民的事，一定去干，做到真正为人民服务！
                              （一九六四年七月×日）
    我重复学习《为人民服务》，……对我来说，怎样对待这五个字呢？我应当端正服务态度。……做到个人问题放在一边，集中精力投入总复习。将来分配到那里工作，坚决服从组织分配。党分配我的工作就是我的志愿。坚决与党一条心，党指到那里就奔到那里。一定要学习张思德同志，为人民利益而贡献自己的一生。我一定为革命事业奋斗到底。
                              （一九六四年十二月×日）
    通过再学习《为人民服务》这篇文章后，我觉得当一个革命战士，干那一种工作，在什么地方工作，都是为革命、为人民服务的。我目前要调（到）新船，但也都是为了革命，不过是分工不同。虽然还没有走，但在这里留一天，必须把这一天的工作干好，这才适合于我们的革命队伍，适合于人民。
                                （一九六五年七月×日）
    为了战斗的需要，这次我被调来学习潜水，又被任为潜水训练班长。我初次感觉到责任沉重，任务艰巨。本来我学习有困难，加上叫我当班长，那怎样把班的工作搞好呢？通过学习毛主席著作《全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争》这篇文章，使我深深的感觉到，只要发动群众，团结群众，共同把班里的工作搞好，才能更好的完成这个艰巨的任务。
                            （一九六五年六月二十一日）
    我们每一个战士如不懂得剥削，就不懂得革命。虽然我是生长在幸福的日子里，但自己的父母在旧社会里过着痛苦的生活。解放以后，人民在党的领导下过着幸福的生活，但国内的反动分子还没有完全消灭，千方百计地想夺我们的政权，要我们走向黑暗的路。……我（要）站稳阶级立场，勤勤恳恳为人民服务。
                              （一九六五年一月十八日）
    我再学习《反对自由主义》，回忆起来，对别人是马克思主义，对自己是自由主义，这是根本与马克思主义冲突的。更严重的是客观（上）援助了敌人，敌人很喜欢我们内部存有自由主义……。我们必须忠心为国家、为革命、为人民，个人利益服从集体、革命利益，随时随地巩固党与群众的联系……今后不管在什么艰苦复杂的环境中，一定经得起考验。只要对革命、对祖国人民有益，一定奋斗到底。
                                  （一九六四年九月×日）
    我已成为一个为人民服务的海军战士，应当做到勤俭节约，支援社会主义建设。所以我今后一定不浪费钱，对于一些同志家中有困难，要热情的帮助，使他能更好的为人民服务。每天在吃饭中不浪费粮食，把两万五千里长征的革命先辈所过的生活和我今天所过的生活用来对比，更好的为人民服务，节约更多的物资支援社会主义建设。
                                （一九六四年六月×日）
    有一次，我丢掉了油，受到机电军士长的批评。……我马上找毛主席著作学习。毛主席说：我们要进行大规模的建设，但是我国是一个很穷的国家，这是一个矛盾，全面地持久地厉行节约，就是解决这个矛盾的方法。
    我觉得，我浪费这些油是劳动人民辛辛苦苦劳动出来的。我也是劳动（家庭）出身，如果我劳动出来的果实受到人家随便浪费，我会感觉怎样？一滴油，就是劳动人民的一滴汗。我们当兵，是为人民服务的，是人民的勤务员，把劳动人民劳动出来的果实随便浪费，就是没有从人民利益出发。
                              （一九六五年一月十三日）
    当好红色接班人“五不忘”：
    （一）永远不忘过去，永不变质；
    （二）永远不忘革命（果实）来之不易；
    （三）永远不忘有阶级斗争；
    （四）永远不忘干革命；
    （五）永远不忘集体。
                              （一九六四年七月×日）
    一忆旧社会的苦，看今天的甜，问一问你忘本没有。
    二忆革命果实来之不易，看一看今天的阶级斗争形势，问一问你当好接班人了没有。
                                （一九六四年八月×日）
    接班要接：
    （一）无产阶级的班。
    （二）为革命干到底的班。
    （三）我军优良传统的班。
    （四）阶级斗争、建设社会主义的班。
    （五）为实现共产主义的班。
                                （一九六四年八月×日）
    （三）天不怕，地不怕，排除万难，争取胜利
    通过学习《愚公移山》，对我的教育很大。我今后一定要克服一切困难，不怕太阳晒，不怕风吹雨打，不怕痛，不怕累，一定把轻武器射击技术学到手，更好的消灭敌人。
                                （一九六四年五月×日）
    毛主席说：我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西，必须向一切内行的人们（不管是什么人）学经济工作，拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。……我在平时专业学习中，也遇到不少的困难，有些总是学不会……今后一定虚心向懂的同志学习，不管是什么人，都愿意拜他们做老师，更好的学一切本领，为祖国献身。
                                  （一九六四年八月×日）
    目前正在开始学习变向离合器的一章。当初我一听到教员和有些同志说这一章最难，而且是最重要的一章，有点害怕起来，怕学不好，怕困难。在这样的情况下，我只好翻开毛主席著作找答案。愚公是一位老人，能将挡住他家去路的两座大山搬走，难道我遇到目前一点困难就被吓倒？……我应学习愚公这种精神，敢于克服困难，向困难作斗争。
                                  （一九六四年八月×日）
    这次出海回来以后，我思想上有了一点波动，因在这次出海时风浪特别大，全身特别累，感觉到四肢无力，饭都吃不下去。所以就想回陆地工作，这个问题，在一个时间还没有解决，我只好向毛主席著作找答案……。通过学习愚公（移山）这一文，给我极大的鼓舞和教育。我想，我是一个青年，也是一个革命战士。对一个革命战士来说，是不怕苦，不怕累，不怕千难万危。这是我军的优良传统。……所以我今后一定好好锻炼，安心工作，要在暴风雨中锻炼成一个坚强的革命战士，不管风吹雨打，在最艰苦的日子里，一定要经得起考验。
                                （一九六五年一月九日）
    我再次学习《愚公移山》一文，给我增添无比的力量。我应当有不怕困难、克服困难、吃苦耐劳的精神，有坚持（到）胜利的信心。……我们出海虽然晕船呕吐，但只要多锻炼，今天晕船，明天可能不晕；明天再晕船，再锻炼，直到不晕船为止。
                                  （一九六五年一月九日）
    我第一次参加了（海上）作战。在这次作战中，我遇到不少困难，风浪较大，战艇不断摇摆，使人头昏呕吐，……。遇到困难，只好找毛主席著作来解决。毛主席说，我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的，越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。目前，重重困难就摆在面前，看你能不能承担，能不能克服，也就是考验你的时候。是不是在这困难面前能经得起考验呢？能不能在大风浪中树立最坚强的志气呢？对一个真正的革命战士和真正的好同志来说，不管困难有多大，不管在复杂情况下，千难万险的条件下，都能克服，都能经得起考验。既然我要成为一个真正的革命者，必须这样做，一定克服困难，向困难作斗争。只有斗争，才有胜利。
                              （一九六五年二月十八日）
    （四）时刻不忘阶级斗争， 随时准备消灭一切来犯的敌人
    《关于重庆谈判》一文，揭露了蒋介石集团的阴谋——假和平谈判。世界上一切反动派是不愿意放下他们的血刀的，直到他们死亡。所以，我们应当把世界上的无产阶级联合起来，共同打倒世界上的一切敌人。并要认识到，世界进步情况和光明前途，在革命（路）上是曲折的，还有很多障碍物，我们必须克服各种困难。要革命，就要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜……。目前，美帝国主义在我们的兄弟国家点起战火。我们不能麻痹大意，随时随地提高警惕，粉碎一切来犯的侵略者。
                                （一九六四年十月×日）
    毛主席告诉我们：“战争的目的不是别的，就是‘保存自己，消灭敌人’”，而且“战争目的中，消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的，因为只有大量地消灭敌人，才能有效地保存自己”。所以我们必须练（好）杀敌本领，才能更好的保存自己。但是，保存自己为的是什么？就是为了更好地杀敌人、保卫自己的祖国人民、建设社会主义……为人民利益，就不怕牺牲自己，而牺牲自己是最光荣的。
                                （一九六四年六月×日）
    通过学习《战争的目的在于消灭战争》这一章，使我懂得什么是正义的战争和非正义的战争。就象目前美帝国主义侵入越南，在越南土地上点起火来，这就是非正义战争。越南人民为了保卫自己的祖国，保卫自己的家乡，为了使人民过安宁的生活，要站起来打起正义战争的旗帜，这就是正义战争。美帝国主义逼着他们打仗，逼到越南人民的头上。越南人民为了自己的生存，过自由的生活，他们必须这样做。
    使我也懂得：参军要革命、作战的真实目的、怎样去消灭敌人。特别是，目前美帝国主义在兄弟越南点起战火。我们每一个革命军人都必须支援越南，作好作战准备。听战鼓一响，命令一下，毫无犹豫地拿起枪杆，跑上战场。以阶级仇恨去杀敌，绝不留情！
                                （一九六四年八月×日）
    神枪手
    一枪撂倒黄世仁，
    二枪撂倒蒋光头，
    三枪撂倒美国鬼，
    四枪撂倒众走狗。
                                （一九六四年×月×日）
    《“糟得很”和“好得很”》，通过这一章的学习，使我明确我们起来革命，打倒三大敌人，人民才得到自由的生活。这对于人民来说就是好得很，但对于美帝国主义来说就是糟得很。因为他们站在人民的头顶，他们必须剥削人民，压迫人民，叫人民做奴隶，他们才能过着好的生活。毛主席告诉我们，一切反动派如果说我们的坏话，我们就做对了；如果他们说我们的好处，那我们就是做错了。我们应当牢记毛主席的话。我们必须提高警惕，不能忘记还有阶级斗争，要高举毛泽东的旗帜，向一切破坏社会主义损坏人民利益的阶级敌人作斗争。
                                （一九六四年九月×日）
    中央人民广播电台发出新闻，中国在一九六四年十月十六日十五时进行原子弹实验，发出第一次爆炸的声明。这次原子弹爆炸有重大意义，是为了保卫国防，保卫全世界受剥削受压迫的人民，是用来反对美帝国主义使用原子核武器的。
                  （一九六四年十月十七日早上五点多钟）
    我们应当牢记阶级斗争，除非世界上的一切反动派被消灭，不可能没有阶级斗争的存在。如我们一放弃阶级斗争，反动派就会钻空子争夺政权。这一来，我们的国家就有可能成为修正主义的国家，人民就会遭殃，重新走向黑暗的道路。这是一件多么危险的大事啊！
                              （一九六四年十一月×日）
    学习了《将革命进行到底》，……我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的话，敌人存在一天，就有战争的可能。目前美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派还没有消灭，战争是必然存在的。所以我们要更高举革命旗帜，站稳立场，不能麻痹，彻底把革命进行到底，使祖国永远不变色。
                              （一九六五年二月十二日）
    通过学习《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》这篇文章，使我进一步提高认识。……目前美帝国主义把战火烧到了我们身边，蒋介石靠着美帝国主义的势力也乘机来捣乱。因此，我必须做好一切战备工作，把各项工作落实到“打”字上，做到开得动、打得准，敌人一来就不会措手不及。这样不管天上、海上、陆地的一切敌人都会消灭干净。我必须做好三个准备：一、打美帝国主义侵略者；二、打蒋介石；三、援越抗美。这就是我的义务。我一定贡献自己的一切力量，（以）至于生命。只要我的气还是喘着，我一定斗争下去，决不在敌人面前屈服，坚决解放受苦受难的劳动人民。
                              （一九六五年四月十五日）
