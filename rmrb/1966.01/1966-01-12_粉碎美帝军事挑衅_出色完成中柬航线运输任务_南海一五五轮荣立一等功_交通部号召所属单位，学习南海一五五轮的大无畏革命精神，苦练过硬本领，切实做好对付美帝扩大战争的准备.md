    Smashed American Imperialist Military Provocations and Excellently Completed the China-Cambodia Shipping Mission
    "Nanhai 155" Ship Awarded First Class Merit
    Ministry of Communications Calls on Subordinate Units to Learn from the "Nanhai 155" Ship's Dauntless Revolutionary Spirit, Diligently Practice Solid Skills, and Earnestly Prepare to Cope with the American Imperialists' Expanded War

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 11th - The Ministry of Communications and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee held a celebration and award ceremony in Guangzhou on the 9th to commend the "Nanhai 155" ship for repeatedly smashing provocations and threats from American imperialist aircraft and warships on the China-Cambodia route over the past year and more, and for excellently completing its maritime transportation tasks. The Ministry of Communications and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee respectively awarded the "Nanhai 155" ship a collective First Class Merit.

    Tao Qi, Vice Minister of Communications, read out at the meeting the decision of the Ministry of Communications and the Political Department of the CPC Ministry of Communications to award the "Nanhai 155" ship a collective First Class Merit, calling on all units in the national transportation system, especially water transport vessels, to learn from the "Nanhai 155" ship's heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and their courageous, tenacious, resourceful, and calm fighting style, and to diligently practice solid skills. Among these, the most fundamental is to learn from them in taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing the "Four Firsts," and vigorously promoting the "Three-Eight Style." Kou Qingyan, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, read out at the meeting the decision of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee to award the "Nanhai 155" ship a collective First Class Merit, calling on all employees in the province's transportation system to learn from their dauntless revolutionary spirit of not fearing danger in the face of the enemy, and to earnestly make all preparations to cope with the American imperialists' expanded war of aggression against Vietnam.

    In the course of shipping and transportation between China and Cambodia for over a year, the "Nanhai 155" ship has constantly been subjected to provocations by American imperialist aircraft and warships. On one voyage, a total of 42 sorties of American bandit aircraft trailed our merchant ship for over 1,200 nautical miles in turn, and circled over the ship more than 350 times. The crew members of the "Nanhai 155" ship waged a heroic struggle against the serious acts of American imperialist aircraft and warships disrupting freedom of navigation on the high seas, enabling the cargo ship flying the five-star red flag of our country to continue to cleave the waves and advance, and excellently complete its transportation tasks, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the new Chinese seafarers.

    At the celebration and award ceremony, the "Nanhai 146" ship, the "Nanhai 148" ship, and the "Nanhai 183" ship were also awarded merit citations by the Guangzhou Maritime Transport Bureau for outstanding completion of foreign transport tasks and meritorious performance.

    粉碎美帝军事挑衅　出色完成中柬航线运输任务
    南海一五五轮荣立一等功
    交通部号召所属单位，学习南海一五五轮的大无畏革命精神，苦练过硬本领，切实做好对付美帝扩大战争的准备
    新华社广州十一日电　交通部和广东省人民委员会九日在广州举行庆功授奖大会，表彰南海一五五轮近一年多来在中国—柬埔寨航线上，多次粉碎了美帝国主义飞机、军舰的挑衅和威胁，出色地完成了海上运输任务。交通部和广东省人民委员会分别给予南海一五五轮记集体一等功。
    交通部副部长陶琦在大会上宣读了交通部、中共交通部政治部给南海一五五轮记集体一等功的决定，号召全国交通系统所有单位，特别是水运船舶，学习南海一五五轮敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概和英勇顽强、机智沉着的战斗作风，苦练过硬本领。其中，最根本的是学习他们以毛泽东思想为指针，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，落实“四个第一”，大兴“三八作风”。广东省副省长寇庆延在大会上宣读了广东省人民委员会给南海一五五轮记集体一等功的决定，号召全省交通运输系统的全体职工学习他们在敌人面前临危不惧的大无畏革命精神，切实做好对付美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的一切准备。
    南海一五五轮近一年多来在中柬之间航行运输中，曾不断遭到美帝国主义的飞机、军舰的挑衅，在一次航行中，美国强盗飞机共四十二架次对我国这艘商船轮番跟踪一千二百多浬，并在轮船上空盘旋三百五十多圈。对于美帝国主义飞机、军舰破坏公海航行自由的严重行为，南海一五五轮的船员们进行了英勇的斗争，使飘扬着我国五星红旗的货轮继续破浪前进，出色地完成了运输任务，表现了新中国海员的英雄气概。
    在庆功授奖大会上，南海一四六轮、南海一四八轮和南海一八三轮由于出色地完成了对外运输任务并有立功表现，同时受到广州海运管理局的记功奖励。
