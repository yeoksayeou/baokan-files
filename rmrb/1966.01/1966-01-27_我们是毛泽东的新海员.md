    I read many articles written by navigators when I was a student. They recorded the turbulent and relentless storms and waves on the ocean, as well as the sailors' miserable and lonely sailing lives. They all helplessly cursed the sailing life...

    Today, the storms and waves on the Atlantic and Indian Oceans remain the same, but they can never frighten the ardent hearts of New China's sailors, who are devoted to the motherland and the world revolution. Among our newly emerging ocean-going sailors, everyone is filled with revolutionary optimism, loving the seafaring work and life. Because we are not forced to become sailors for a living, but for the needs of the motherland's socialist construction and the revolutionary cause.

    Since ancient times, there have been millions of sailors, but our predecessors have never been as happy and glorious as we are now. Because we are Mao Zedong's new sailors.

    It was the summer of 1961. We were piloting the first Chinese ocean-going vessel, the "Peace" (Heping) ship, fully loaded with the friendship of the Chinese people, and arrived at the port of Rangoon, filled with large and small golden pagodas.

    Burmese friends extended their friendly hands to welcome us.

    When our ship was moored in the swift-flowing Rangoon River, an elderly overseas Chinese woman with white hair, accompanied by her children and grandchildren, came to the ship in a small sampan, circling the ship several times before rowing to the ship's side. She stroked the handrail of the gangway and said, "Is this the ship from the motherland? Ah! The motherland has such a big ship!" When our young sailors went down the ladder to help her on board, they found that happy and blissful tears were streaming down her blind eyes.

    Years of seafaring work have made me realize how many overseas Chinese are eagerly looking forward to the growing strength of the motherland in those distant corners of the world!

    In the winter of 1962, when the Siberian cold current was invading the entire Asian continent, the Indian Ocean was in its most tranquil season. The sea presented a blue sky, and a seagull screeched as it flew into the distance from the occasional floating seaweed. It was during this season that China's ocean-going ship "Friendship" (Youyi) arrived at the capital of the rubber kingdom, Ceylon - the port of Colombo. Dockworkers expressed their warmest welcome to us, raising their thumbs and pointing to the bright and splendid five-star red flag hanging at the stern, shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong!..." A Ceylonese friend working at the port had just had a daughter. After discussing it with his family, he named the newborn girl "Friendship" (Youyi). He told us: "The friendship between the Chinese people and the Ceylonese people is profound. In order to express my respect and friendship for the great Chinese people's revolution, I named my little daughter 'Friendship'." The captain and representatives of the crew made a special visit to the family of this Ceylonese friend to convey the Chinese people's friendship to the Ceylonese people, and also visited this healthy and beautiful little girl who symbolized Chinese-Ceylonese friendship - "Friendship" (Youyi).

    Whenever I recall the moment when the "Friendship" (Youhao) ship arrived at the port of Durres in our brotherly country Albania, it is always exciting and unforgettable. Sincere and warm friendship came from the bottom of every Albanian comrade's heart. Almost every Albanian we met shook hands and embraced us warmly. Although it was the first time we met, it was as if we were family. An Albanian sailor comrade said to me, "The port of Guangzhou and the port of Durres are two pillars of friendship, the ships of China and Albania are bridges of friendship, and our sailor brothers of both countries are spreading the seeds of friendship back and forth." We deeply felt that we could make even a small contribution to this revolutionary friendship built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and that would be supremely glorious.

    In April 1965, China's first ocean-going ship "Friendship" (Youhao) sailed into Gibraltar, which controls the key point of the sea route between Europe, Asia and Africa and occupies an important position in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans. After docking, a British pilot told me an interesting story:

    "At one o'clock this afternoon, I received an order from the port director to guide the first Chinese ship 'Friendship' (Youhao) that would arrive in Gibraltar at four o'clock. I was curious and longing for New China, so I waited on the pilot boat anchored at the south entrance before two o'clock. At three twenty, I saw a fast, beautiful, neat, and modern ten-thousand-ton freighter sailing from east to west from the Rock of Gibraltar. I immediately judged at the time: this will not be the ship I am going to guide, because a Chinese ship cannot be so big, fast, good, and modern. As expected, it sailed past the port and sped towards the Atlantic Ocean. Twenty minutes later, an old and slow black oil tanker sailed in. Because the distance was very far, I could not see the flag hanging on the stern. But I thought this might be the ship I was going to guide, so I notified the captain of the pilot boat to prepare for departure. But when the ship got a little closer, I immediately recognized it as the Spanish oil tanker ×× which often comes to Gibraltar to refuel. I was a little impatient, and I forgot that I had come out to wait ahead of time. When I anxiously saw that the hands on my watch were pointing to five minutes before four o'clock, a modern ocean-going ship of about 15,000 tons, silver-gray in color, shone unusually brightly in the sunlight and galloped forward, riding the wind and waves. I immediately thought that maybe the port director had made a mistake with the time, and now I can't even see the shadow of a Chinese ship! But when I looked up, it had already sailed into the harbor channel. To my surprise, flying in the breeze under the warm sunshine was the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China. When I came to my senses, I was very happy, and I was proud to be able to guide such a beautiful Chinese ship."

    All over the world, there are millions of friends who have goodwill towards China, and they are watching us with good wishes and curiosity.

    When the sailors and dockworkers of a British shipping company came to the Chinese ship, they were surprised and strange to find that our captain and sailors were sitting at the same table, talking and laughing while eating. A stevedore was surprised and called his companions on the deck to come and see: "The captain is eating with the sailors." But this matter equally aroused the strangeness of our crew comrades. Why did this ordinary matter make the British friends so strange?

    A British sailor said: "This is great, the captain and the sailors are eating together. On our ship, the captain eats several times better than us, and which sailor dares to sit with the captain? Not to mention talking and laughing." I think this sailor has not been to New China, so he cannot understand that the Chinese people live in a warm socialist family, and we have an incomparably superior socialist system.

    In these years, we have encountered foreign people expressing friendship to the Chinese people anytime and anywhere. People all over the world are watching our great motherland with great enthusiasm. Our New China's sailors are not only transporting goods from one corner of the world to another, but more importantly, bringing the Chinese people's friendship to the class brothers and people all over the world, and at the same time bringing the friendship of the people of the world back to China. We are Mao Zedong's new sailors, how can we not feel extremely proud and glorious!

    We have the ambition to travel all over the world, we have the broad mind of the ocean, and we have the firm will to "take the ship as our home" and "take the ocean as our home" and strive for the ocean-going cause of the motherland for life. Every time we sail back to our country and see the thriving socialist construction of our motherland, as well as the meticulous care of the Party and the people of our country for us, we feel infinite comfort and gratitude.

    Every Chinese ocean-going ship rides the long wind and breaks through thousands of miles of waves to sail the seas, and the real helmsman who masters the correct course on the bridge is our great Mao Zedong Thought, which will always guide us to the vast ocean of socialism. (Attached picture)

### 我们是毛泽东的新海员

    我们是毛泽东的新海员
    远洋轮船“友好号”船长  贝汉廷
    我做学生的时候，读过很多航海家写的文章。他们记述了海洋上澎湃汹涌的无情的暴风巨浪，以及海员们的凄苦、寂寞的航海生涯，他们都无可奈何地诅咒着航海生活……。
    今天，大西洋、印度洋上的暴风巨浪没有变样，但暴风巨浪绝吓不倒新中国海员一颗为祖国和世界革命事业的热忱的心。在我国新生的远洋海员中，人人都充满了革命的乐观主义精神，热爱着航海工作和航海生活。因为我们并不是为了生活被迫来当海员，而是为了祖国的社会主义建设和革命事业的需要。
    自古以来，有千百万的海员，可是我们的前辈从来不会象我们现在这般的幸福和光荣。因为我们是毛泽东的新海员。
    那是一九六一年的夏天。我们驾驶着第一艘中国的远洋船舶“和平号”，满载着中国人民的友谊，来到了布满大小金塔的仰光港。
    缅甸朋友伸出友情的手欢迎我们。
    当我们的船系泊在流水湍急的仰光河中的时候，一位白发斑斑的华侨老太太，带着全家儿孙们坐着小舢舨来到船旁，绕船数周后划到船舷。她抚摸着舷梯的扶木说：“这就是祖国来的船吗？啊！祖国有这样大的船了！”当我们年青的水手下梯去扶她上船的时候，发现她那失明的双眼中，淌下了快乐和幸福的热泪。
    几年来的航海工作使我知道，在那遥远的天涯海角，有多少华侨在热切地盼望着祖国日益强大啊！
    一九六二年的冬天，当西伯利亚的寒流侵袭着整个亚洲大陆的时候，印度洋正是最宁静的季节，海面上呈现着蔚蓝色的天空，海鸥尖叫一声从偶而漂来的海上浮萍上飞往远方。正当这个季节，我国远洋船“友谊号”到达了橡胶王国——锡兰的首都科伦坡港。码头工人们向我们表示最热烈的欢迎，他们伸出大拇指指着船尾悬挂着的光辉灿烂的五星红旗喊着：“毛泽东好！……”一位在港口工作的锡兰朋友刚好生了一个女儿。他合家商量后，给这位刚诞生的小女孩取名为“友谊”。他向我们表示：“中国人民和锡兰人民的友谊是深厚的。为了表示对伟大的中国人民革命的敬意和友好，我为我的小女儿取名‘友谊’。”船长和船员代表们特意拜访了这位锡兰朋友的家庭，传达了中国人民对锡兰人民的友谊，还探望了这位象征着中锡友谊的健壮美丽的小女孩——“友谊”。
    每当我记忆起“友好”轮到达我们的兄弟之邦阿尔巴尼亚的海港都拉斯的时刻，总是令人激动难忘的。真挚亲切的友谊来自每个阿尔巴尼亚同志的心底。几乎每个我们碰到的阿尔巴尼亚人都和我们热烈地握手拥抱。虽然是初见，但如亲人一般。一位阿尔巴尼亚的海员同志对我说：“广州港和都拉斯港是两个友谊的桥墩，中阿两国的船只是友谊之桥，而我们两国的海员兄弟们来往传布着友谊的种子。”我们深深感到，我们能为这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的革命友谊，即使作出微小的贡献，那也是无尚光荣的。
    一九六五年四月，我国历史上第一艘远洋船“友好号”驶入了扼欧亚非通航路要冲，居地中海及大西洋要道的直布罗陀港。当靠好码头后，一位英国引水员对我讲了这么一个有趣的故事：
    “今天下午一时，我接到港长的命令，来引领将于四时抵达直布罗陀的第一艘中国船‘友好号’，我对新中国是怀着好奇和向往的，因此，不到二时我已守候在停泊在南口的引水船上。三时二十分，我见到一艘快速而漂亮整齐的、现代化的万吨海轮，由直布罗陀山自东向西驶来，我当时立即作出判断：这艘不会是我所要引的船，因为中国船不可能这样大、快、好，不可能这样现代化。果然不出我所料，它驶过港口而直向大西洋方向疾驶而去了。二十分钟以后，又驶来一艘陈旧而速度缓慢的黑色油船，因为距离很远，看不出船尾所悬的国旗。但是我认为这可能是我所要引的船了，因此通知引水船的船长作好出发的准备。可是当那船略微驶近后，我立刻认出来了，这艘船是常来直布罗陀港添油的西班牙油船××号。我有点不耐烦了，我忘记了自己是提前出来等候的。当我焦急地看到手表上指着四点差五分的时候，一艘估计有一万五千吨左右的银灰色的现代化远洋船，在阳光下闪出异常的光彩，乘风破浪飞奔而来。我立刻想到，可能港长把时间弄错了，现在连中国船的影子也见不到啊！可是当我抬头一看，它已驶到进港的航道上来。使我惊异的是，沐浴在和煦阳光下迎风飘扬的是中华人民共和国的五星红旗。当我清醒过来以后，我感到真高兴，我为自己能引领这样漂亮的中国船而感到骄傲。”
    在世界各地，有着千百万对中国怀着善意的朋友，他们以良好的祝愿和好奇的心情注视着我们。
    当英国一个轮船公司的海员和码头工人们，来到中国船上的时候，使他们感到新鲜和奇怪的是，我们的船长和水手们竟坐在一张桌上谈笑吃饭。一位装卸工友惊奇得到甲板上叫他的同伴们来看：“船长和水手在一起吃饭。”但这件事同样地引起了我们的船员同志的奇怪，为什么这件平常的事如此地使英国朋友感到奇怪？
    一位英国海员说：“这太好了，船长和水手一起吃饭。在我们船上，船长吃的比我们好几倍，而且那一个水手敢和船长坐在一起呢？更不用说谈笑了。”我想，这位海员没有到过新中国，因此他不可能了解中国人民生活在温暖的社会主义大家庭中，我们有着无比优越的社会主义制度。
    这几年，我们随时随地都在碰到外国人民对中国人民表示友谊的事。全世界人民都在十分热切地观望着我们伟大的祖国。我们新中国的海员不仅是把货物从世界的一角运往另一角，更主要的是把中国人民的友谊带给全世界的阶级弟兄和人民，同时把世界人民的友谊带回中国来。我们是毛泽东的新海员，我们怎么能够不感到无比的自豪和光荣呢！
    我们有走遍四海的雄心壮志，我们有海洋一般的辽阔胸襟，我们有“以船为家”“以海洋为家”终身为祖国的远洋事业奋斗的坚定意志。每当我们远航回国，见到祖国的社会主义建设事业蒸蒸日上，以及党和祖国人民对我们无微不至的关怀，便使我们感到无限的欣慰和感激。
    每一艘中国远洋船只乘长风破万里浪远航四海，在驾驶台上掌握正确航向的真正舵手，是我们伟大的毛泽东思想，他永远指导着我们驶向辽阔的社会主义的海洋。（附图片）
