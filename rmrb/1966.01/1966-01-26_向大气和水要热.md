    To Draw Heat from the Atmosphere and Water
    Lü Canren
    People need thermal energy for daily life, and industrial and agricultural production, especially heat engines, need it even more. The utilization of thermal energy is closely related to people. Engels passionately praised the significance of thermal energy and its transformation for the development of human society. He wrote: "The practical discovery that mechanical motion can be transformed into heat is very old, so old that this discovery can be regarded as the beginning of human history. Whatever achievements existed before this discovery—for example, the invention of tools and the domestication of animals—people only began to make some inanimate natural forces serve them after they learned to obtain fire by friction" (《Dialectics of Nature》, p. 83).
    Since ancient times, the thermal energy used by people has mainly been taken from organic fuels buried in the earth's crust—coal, oil, natural gas, etc. The reserves of such fuels are limited. According to the current growth rate of fuel consumption, it is estimated that if we do not find ways to increase sources and reduce consumption, they may be exhausted in less than a few centuries.
    The laws of thermodynamics in physics state that thermal energy always spontaneously transfers from high-temperature objects to low-temperature objects and never spontaneously from low-temperature objects to high-temperature objects; any heat engine can only work if there are both a high-temperature heat source and a low-temperature cold source. It is impossible for a heat engine to do work with only one heat source; in a heat engine, the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical energy (or power) is proportional to the temperature difference between the two sources. The higher the temperature of the heat source, the greater the percentage of heat converted into mechanical energy. In recent decades, people have used "heat pumps" to extract heat from the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, and seas for utilization, which is precisely the result of applying this law.
    In the environmental media around us—the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, and seas—there is an inexhaustible amount of energy, which ultimately comes from solar radiation. It can be reused after being used and does not consume resources stored inside the earth. Some people have calculated that if the temperature of seawater could be lowered by one-hundredth of a degree, the heat released would be enough to power all the factories in the world for 1,700 years if it were all converted into power. Although this idea of extracting heat from a single heat source to turn it into power violates the aforementioned laws of thermodynamics and is impossible to realize, this figure shows how abundant the energy in the media around us is.
    The energy stored in the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, and seas is abundant and ubiquitous, but people have not utilized it for a long time. The reasons are, firstly, that a cold source cannot be found objectively, making it impossible to use it to make heat engines work; secondly, its temperature is only as high as the ambient temperature, and thermal energy will not spontaneously transfer to high-temperature objects, so it cannot be used for heating. Due to these limitations, people have always been helpless in the face of so much energy in the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, and seas, letting it dissipate into the boundless universe with the change of seasons. When people need heat, they burn fuel.
    There are many places in production and life where heat is needed, and some require very high temperatures, such as the smelting industry, which cannot do without fuel. However, the temperature in many places where heat is used is not much different from the ambient temperature. For example, in winter heating, an indoor temperature of about 20 degrees Celsius is sufficient. At this time, the average outdoor temperature in temperate regions is around zero degrees Celsius, and the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is only about 20 degrees. Furthermore, a large amount of hot water used in daily life, medicine, or food, textile, and other industrial sectors often only needs to be 40 to 60 degrees Celsius, while the temperature of natural water is often 5 to 20 degrees Celsius, with a difference of only a few tens of degrees. However, in order to obtain hot air or hot water that is only a few tens of degrees above the ambient temperature, people still have to use fuel to burn stoves. At least 20% to 40% of the fuel that people painstakingly extract each year is consumed in this area.
    What is the economic efficiency of using fuel in this way? Thermodynamics tells us that if the same amount of heat, one thousand calories, is taken from a heat source to supply a heat engine to do work, the higher the temperature of the heat source, the greater the work capacity. For example, assuming the ambient temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, when the heat source temperature is 1,500 degrees Celsius, theoretically 85% of the 1,000 calories of heat from the heat source can be converted into work; while when the heat source temperature is 60 degrees Celsius, only 18% of the 1,000 calories of heat can be converted into work. Thus, it can be seen that due to the difference in the quality of heat, the amount of work that can be converted can differ by several times. Fuel combustion can produce a high temperature of about 2,000 degrees, which is a high-quality thermal energy that should be used to generate power in a heat engine or used in other more effective places, rather than being used as an overqualified resource to boil water or heat.
    As early as 1852, someone envisioned a mechanical device—called a "heat pump"—to raise the temperature of energy from the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, and seas, just like people use water pumps to raise the water level, to solve the contradictions in the aforementioned thermal energy utilization. Although the laws of thermodynamics clearly point out that thermal energy will not spontaneously transfer from low-temperature objects to high-temperature objects, they do not exclude the possibility that, with the assistance of external energy, it can be transferred from low-temperature objects to high-temperature objects. For example, the working principle of common compression refrigeration devices is like this. It uses a low-boiling-point substance (such as Freon) to evaporate and absorb heat in the evaporator of the cold room; the steam is compressed by a compressor (which consumes external energy) to increase the temperature; the high-temperature steam enters the condenser to condense and release heat to the surrounding medium; the condensed liquid is depressurized and enters the evaporator in the cold room again. This cycle continues, continuously extracting heat from the low-temperature cold room and transferring it to the higher-temperature environmental medium. The principle of a heat pump is exactly the same as that of a refrigeration device. It uses a low-boiling-point substance to extract heat from the air or rivers, lakes, and seas to evaporate it, compresses it, and releases heat in the place where heat is needed (where the condenser is located). Assuming the temperature of the river water is 5 degrees Celsius, hot water or hot air of about 40 to 50 degrees Celsius can be obtained at the condenser. This temperature level can fully meet the requirements of general heating and heat supply. The circulation process used for this heating purpose is thermodynamically called "heat pump cycle" to distinguish it from the above-mentioned "refrigeration cycle" for the purpose of refrigeration.
    In this way, the heat pump cycle theory seems to solve the contradictions in thermal energy utilization. However, theory alone cannot solve the problem; it also needs to be tested in practice to see if it can achieve the intended purpose. The crux of the matter, from 1852 to the 1930s of this century, for the entire half century or more that heat pumps were not put into practical application, lies precisely here. Because this theory only talks about the not-so-important half of the engineering scientific problem, which does not conform to the actual situation of engineering economy at that time. Before the 1930s of this century, power plants had low efficiency, high coal consumption, and high electricity costs, the manufacturing technology of compressors and heat exchangers was not sophisticated enough, and the price of fuel was relatively cheap, so using heat pumps was not technically and economically worthwhile. Around the Second World War, science and technology progressed rapidly, manufacturing technology and power generation efficiency generally improved, electricity costs decreased, while fuel prices continued to rise. At the same time, many precision industries and public buildings required a large number of artificial climate devices, so many countries actively carried out heat pump research work and have been quite widely used in building air conditioning, hot water supply, and food dehydration and other drying technologies, achieving good practical results.
    According to calculations and actual use results, if the temperature of the river water is 5 degrees Celsius and the temperature of the supplied hot water or hot air is 40 degrees Celsius, the actual heat energy obtained is about four times the heat equivalent of the electricity consumed. If the losses in thermal power generation and power supply are taken into account, comparing heat pump heating with ordinary boiler room heating can save about half of the fuel; compared with electric furnace heating, the same amount of heat can be obtained by consuming only a quarter of the electricity.
    The characteristic of the heat pump heating device is that it does not need a boiler and it is easy to achieve automation. For a long time, people have tried hard to remove the chimneys on buildings, but they have not been able to do so. If heat pump heating is used instead, many chimneys can be eliminated. When people use boilers for heating, the boiler equipment is idle for most of the year. When the building's temperature is too high and air conditioning is needed in the summer, there must be another set of refrigeration equipment. Two sets of equipment are alternately idle and used in isolation, which is very uneconomical. If heat pump heating is used, in hot weather, as long as the pipe flow is slightly reversed, the same set of equipment can be used to supply air conditioning, combining heating and cooling equipment, serving two purposes with one thing, greatly improving equipment utilization.
    The sun endows the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, and seas with endless energy. For hundreds of millions of years, how much air and water have heated and cooled again and again. How to make this infinite energy in nature serve our country's socialist construction is a task facing thermal energy workers.

    向大气和水要热
    吕灿仁
    人们生活需要热能，工农业生产特别是热力发动机更需要热能。热能的利用和人们的关系非常密切。恩格斯热情地歌颂过热能及其转化对人类社会发展的意义，他写道：“在实践上发现机械运动可以转化为热是很古的事情，古到可以把这种发现看作人类历史的开端。无论在这个发现以前还有什么样的成就——例如，工具的发明和动物的驯养，但是人们只是在学会了摩擦取火以后，才第一次使某种无生命的自然力替自己服务”（《自然辩证法》第八三页）。
    自古以来，人们使用的热能，主要取之于地壳内埋藏的有机燃料——煤、油、天然气等。这类燃料，蕴藏量有限，按照现在燃料使用的增长率估计，如果不设法开源节流，很有可能不到几百年就要用完。
    物理学中的热力学定律指出：热能总是自发地由高温物体转移到低温物体，决不会自发地由低温物体转移到高温物体；任何热力发动机只有同时存在较高温度的热源和较低温度的冷源时才能工作，只有一个热源就想使热力发动机作功是办不到的；热力发动机中，热能转化为机械能
  （或动力）与两个源的温差成正比，热源的温度愈高，热转化为机械能的百分比愈大。近几十年来，人们运用“热泵”汲取大气和江河湖海中的热加以利用，正是运用这一定律的结果。
    在我们周围环境介质——大气、江、河、湖、海中，蕴藏着无穷无尽的能量，这些能量归根到底来自太阳辐射，用了后能够再来，并不消耗地球内部贮存的资源。有人计算过，如果能把海水降低温度百分之一度，所放出的热量全部变为动力的话，足够供当前世界所有工厂一千七百年之用。虽然这种从单一热源取热变为动力的想法是违反上述热力学定律，是不可能实现的。但是这一数字说明我们周围介质中的能量是多么丰富。
    蕴藏在大气和江河湖海中的能量虽多，而且到处都有，可是长期以来人们不加利用。因为一则是客观存在中找不到冷源，无法用它来使热力发动机作功；再则是它的温度只有环境温度那么高，热能又不会自发地向高温物体转移，所以也不能用它来取暖。由于这些限制，人们面对大气和江河湖海中的这么多能量，从来只好望洋兴叹，任凭它随着季节的变化白白地散失到无边无际的宇宙中去。而当人们需要用热时，就烧燃料。
    人们在生产和生活中需要用热的地方很多，有的需要很高的温度，如冶炼工业，不得不用燃料。但是也有很多用热场所的温度，同周围环境温度相差不多。例如冬季采暖，室内温度只要能维持摄氏二十度左右就足够了。这时室外温度在温带地区平均大约在零度上下，室内外温差不过二十度左右。又如在生活、医药或食品、纺织等工业部门中用的大量热水，往往四十到六十度就够了，而自然水的温度很多情况下为五度到二十度，相差也只有几十度。但是，人们为了要得到只高于环境温度几十度的热空气或热水，不得不仍旧用燃料来烧炉灶。人们每年辛辛苦苦采掘到的燃料，至少有百分之二十至四十是在这方面消耗掉了。
    这样使用燃料的经济性如何呢？热力学告诉我们，同样是从热源拿出一千卡的热量供给热力发动机作功，热源温度愈高，作功能力愈大。例如，设环境温度为摄氏零度，当热源温度为摄氏一千五百度时，热源传出一千卡热量，理论上有百分之八十五可变为功；而当热源温度为摄氏六十度时，一千卡热量只有百分之十八可变为功，由此可见，由于热的质的不同，变为功的量，可以相差好几倍。燃料燃烧时可以产生两千度左右的高温，它是一种高质热能，应该让它在热力发动机中产生动力，或使用在其它更有效的地方，而不应当大材小用来烧热水或暖气。
    远在一八五二年，就有人设想一种机械装置——称为“热泵”，象人们利用水泵提高水位那样把大气和江河湖海中的能量温度变高，来解决上述热能利用问题上的矛盾。因为热力学定律虽然明确指出热能不会自发地由低温物体转移到高温物体，但是并不排斥在外界能量协助下可以由低温物体向高温物体转移。例如常见的压缩式制冷装置的工作原理就是如此。它用一种低沸点物质
  （如氟利昂）在冷室的蒸发器中蒸发吸热；蒸汽经压气机压缩（这里要消耗外界能量）提高温度；高温蒸汽进入冷凝器凝结，放热给环境介质；凝结液减压后又进入冷室中的蒸发器。如此循环不已，不断将低温冷室中的热量抽出转移到温度较高的环境介质。热泵与制冷装置的原理完全相同，它用低沸点物质汲取空气或江河湖海的热蒸发，压缩后在需要用热的地方（设置冷凝器）将热放出。设河水的温度为摄氏五度，可在冷凝器处得到约摄氏四五十度的热水或热空气，这一温度水平完全可满足一般采暖和供热的要求。用于这种供热目的的循环过程，在热力学上称为“热泵循环”，以区别上述以制冷为目的的“制冷循环”。
    这样，热泵循环理论看来可解决热能利用问题上的矛盾了。然而光有理论并不能解决问题，还需经过实践的检验，看它是否能够达到预想的目的。从一八五二年到本世纪三十年代以前的整整大半个世纪，热泵一直没有得到实际应用的症结恰恰就在这里。因为这个理论还只说到工程科学问题的非十分重要的那一半，不符合当时工程经济的实际情况。在本世纪三十年代以前，发电厂的效率低，煤耗大，电能成本高，压缩机和换热器的制造技术不够精良，而燃料的价格相对来说比较便宜，因此采用热泵在技术经济上并不合算。在第二次大战前后，科学技术进步很快，制造技术和发电效率普遍提高，电能成本下降，而燃料价格不断上涨，同时很多精密工业和公共建筑要求大量人工气候装置，于是很多国家积极地开展热泵研究工作，并已在建筑物空气调节、热水供应、以及食品脱水等干燥技术中相当广泛地采用，获得良好的实效。
    根据计算和实际使用的结果，如果河水的温度为摄氏五度，供应热水或热空气的温度为摄氏四十度，实际获得的热能约为消耗电能热当量的四倍。如果把热力发电和供电的损失都考虑在内，将热泵供热和通常的锅炉房供热比较，也差不多可以节约一半燃料；同电炉加热法比较，得同样热，只要消耗四分之一电能。
    热泵供暖装置的特点是不要锅炉，而且容易实现自动化。长期以来，人们曾经努力想把建筑物上的烟囱去掉，可是都办不到。如果改用热泵供热，就可取消许多烟囱。人们用锅炉供暖，一年内绝大部分时间，锅炉设备是闲置的。当建筑物夏季温度太高需要冷气时，必须另有一套制冷设备。两套设备，轮流闲置，孤立使用，很不经济。如果用热泵供暖，酷暑天气只要把管道流程稍加倒换，就可用同一套设备供应冷气，使供热和供冷设备结合，一物两用，大大提高设备利用率。
    太阳赋予大气、江、河、湖、海中的能量无穷无尽，亿万年来，有多少空气和水热了再冷，冷了再热。怎样使自然界中这一无穷的能量，为我国的社会主义建设服务，这是热能工作者面临的课题。
