    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Workers' Steel-Like Language
    Rocks are as hard as iron, we are not afraid! Mountains are ten thousand feet high, we are not afraid! On our hands, there are thick calluses; in our hearts, the words of Chairman Mao are engraved!
      ＊　＊　＊
    The workshop is a battlefield, the equipment is our weapons, when people are revolutionized and equipment is good, only then can we win the battle.
      ＊＊＊
    In thought, fight against the word "I"; in work, fight against the word "difficult"; in style, fight against the word "lazy."
      ＊＊＊
    When people are diligent, the equipment is diligent; when people are lazy, the equipment is lazy; when people listen to the Party, the equipment obeys people's management.
     ＊＊＊
    The furnace platform may be small but it is great, it can hold the world and tolerate all under heaven. We are strong enough to move mountains and fill the seas, skillful enough to embroider iron and steel flowers.
      ＊＊＊
    We feel supremely honored to make steel for the motherland, and we cherish an even grander ideal: to refine the entire world into a piece of stainless steel!

  话！
      ＊　＊　＊车间是战场，设备是刀枪，人红设备好，才能打胜仗。
      ＊＊＊在思想上和“我”字斗，在工作上和“难”字斗，在作风上和“懒”字斗。
      ＊＊＊人勤设备勤，人懒设备懒，人听党的话，设备听人管。
     ＊＊＊
    炉台虽小心可大，装得起世界容得了天下。我们力大能拔山填海，手巧能绣钢铁之花。
      ＊＊＊
    我们为祖国炼钢，感到无上荣光，怀中更揣着一个宏伟理想：要把整个世界炼成一块不锈钢！
