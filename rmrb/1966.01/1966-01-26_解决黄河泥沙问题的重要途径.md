    The Yellow River's Problem Lies in Sediment
    Li Fudu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission

    The Yellow River is the world's most famous river for its high sediment content, and historically it has been one of the world's most dangerous rivers. Its harmfulness is manifested in two aspects:

    The water and soil erosion in the vast Loess Plateau area upstream of Sanmenxia in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is very serious. On average, 1.6 billion tons of sediment are washed down each year. This is truly an astonishing figure! In this region, about 200,000 square kilometers, including the Yellow River from Hekouzhen to Longmen and its tributaries, the Luo River above Yongningshan, the Jing River above Dongzhuang, and the Wei River above Baojixia, suffer from particularly severe water and soil erosion. These areas supply an average of more than 1.4 billion tons of sediment to the Yellow River annually, accounting for 88 percent of the total sediment transported downstream.

    The annual rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is not high, but it is mostly concentrated in July, August, and September, and there are many heavy rainstorms. Large amounts of loess are washed away by the water, and the flat original land is cut into countless gullies. In the plateau gully area, more than half of the land has become deep gullies, and the area of arable land on the plateau is shrinking. In the more severely eroded hilly areas, all we see are thousands of gullies and hills of loess divided into pieces. Some of these loess hilly gully areas are barren mountains with few people; others are densely populated, with extensive but low-yield farming. Entire hillsides have been cultivated, resulting in the disappearance of vegetation cover and a lack of three materials (feed, fertilizer, and fuel). Droughts occur nine years out of ten, and the people's lives cannot be improved rapidly. This is one aspect.

    On the other hand, the fertile soil from the middle reaches of the Yellow River is washed into the river and eventually carried to the gently sloping lower reaches of the Yellow River, where it is deposited in large quantities. This causes the riverbed between the two dikes in the lower reaches to rise continuously, turning it into an "above-ground river" and exacerbating the crisis in the entire lower reaches of the Yellow River. In the event of a major flood, breaches, inundations, and even changes in the river's course can occur. Therefore, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have historically been known for severe and frequent floods. Because the lower reaches of the Yellow River have silted up into an above-ground river, the vast plain areas have lost the possibility of using the Yellow River for drainage. This raises the groundwater level in the farmland on both sides of the riverbed, causing salinization in the areas near the Yellow River. The general method of river management, which includes eliminating harm and promoting benefits, involves building dams on rivers to control floods, store water for power generation, and develop irrigation downstream of the dams. It also includes river channel regulation and step-by-step development to achieve comprehensive utilization for flood control, navigation, power generation, drainage, and development of farmland water conservancy along the river. However, in the Yellow River basin, because the river water contains too much sediment, these methods do not work. Building dams to store water leads to reservoirs being quickly filled with silt. Step-by-step development of the river channel accelerates siltation, reduces the flood control capacity of the riverbed, and increases the difficulty of draining farmland on both banks and the degree of salinization. The river channel regulation work in the lower reaches of the Yellow River was originally intended to deepen the river channel, increase the water depth, lower the river water level, and turn the above-ground river into an underground river to facilitate flood discharge, navigation, and drainage. However, with the excessive sediment content and the reduced scouring capacity as the sediment content of the river water increases, regulation is of no avail, and the river channel is still inevitably silted up and raised.

    Before the Yellow River's water level is regulated and sediment is appropriately reduced, the irrigation in the vast North China Plain area of the lower reaches of the Yellow River cannot be developed on a large scale. Drawing water from the Yellow River is not guaranteed due to the river channel's siltation and erratic shifts. Irrigation canals in the exceptionally flat plain areas are inevitably silted up. What is particularly serious is that the drainage conditions in the plain area are very poor. A large amount of water drawn from the Yellow River cannot be drained, and the salinization of vast areas cannot be eliminated. Large-scale siltation projects are also more harmful than beneficial due to the siltation of canals and the difficulty of drainage. At the same time, Yellow River irrigation projects will bring about an even more serious crisis of riverbed siltation in the Yellow River.

    Governing the Yellow River Cannot Simply Apply General River Management Methods
    These experiences and lessons illustrate a very important issue: the root cause of the Yellow River problem is the sediment problem. Because the Yellow River has so much sediment, we cannot rigidly apply the general methods and measures of river management and river utilization to the Yellow River. Doing so will inevitably bring us disappointment and lead to unfavorable consequences contrary to our wishes. Chairman Mao taught us: "If we do not study the particularity of the contradiction, we cannot determine the particular essence of a thing that distinguishes it from other things, and we cannot discover the special causes or special bases of the movement and development of things." In the practice of Yellow River management, we have found the root cause of the Yellow River problem, and we have found that the serious water and soil erosion in the loess areas of Northwest China is the main aspect of the contradiction in the Yellow River problem. It is not only the root cause of drought and poverty in the middle reaches of the Yellow River but also the key to fundamentally controlling and developing the Yellow River. Yellow River management must address this root cause and prescribe the right remedy. We must start by solving the sediment problem, that is, by dealing with the average of 1.6 billion tons of sediment washed down from the water and soil erosion areas each year, so that the Yellow River can be transformed from a harmful river into a beneficial river. Based on this principle, we have proposed the general direction of Yellow River management: to control sediment and store water in the middle reaches and to control floods and discharge sediment in the lower reaches, with control as the main focus. The methods used to achieve this direction of river management, in addition to actively promoting water and soil conservation work in the water and soil erosion areas of the middle reaches of the Yellow River to reduce sediment generation, are to vigorously carry out gully management work, focusing on building silt dams, in this area, and to build sediment retention reservoirs on tributaries with severe water and soil erosion and on appropriate sections of the main stream of the Yellow River above Sanmenxia.

    In the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the more developed agricultural areas with better living conditions and denser populations are mainly the river valley plains, followed by the remnant loess plateaus that have been cut by water and are constantly shrinking. However, these areas account for only a small proportion of the vast loess area. The main problem in the vast majority of areas is the lack of flat land. The example of silt damming in Changshantou Dam in the Qingshui River in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region clearly illustrates this problem. In the Qingshui River basin, where mountains overlap and gullies crisscross, and there is an extreme lack of arable land, the result of sediment siltation has been the emergence of more than 25,000 mu of large, flat land. Last summer, 16,000 mu of this land achieved a bumper harvest. This is such a joyful and inspiring sight!

    Take northern Shaanxi and western Shanxi as examples. The tributary basins on both sides of the Yellow River in these areas are the main sources of sediment supply to the Yellow River. Most of these areas are loess hilly gully areas with very severe water and soil erosion. Although there are also river valley plains, they are scattered and small in area. Taking the Yulin area as an example, in the river valley plains of the Wuding River and its tributaries, since liberation, although irrigation has been vigorously developed, almost all the river beaches have been channeled and irrigated and utilized by the people, it still is far from meeting the needs of the people's lives.

    Building Dams in Gullies: Increasing Production and Managing the Yellow River
    From 1953 to 1955, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission built five large silt dams in Jiuyuangou, a tributary of the Wuding River in Suide County, controlling the entire basin area of Jiuyuangou. After several height increases over the years, by 1964, these dams had retained more than 5 million cubic meters of sediment and created more than 600 mu of fertile dam land. Since 1959, the masses have been planting crops on the dam land. In the extremely dry years of 1962 and 1965, the crops still grew particularly vigorously, showing the outstanding superiority of the dam land. Generally speaking, the yield per unit area of dam land is two to three times higher than that of terraced fields and four to five times higher than that of hillside land.

    The people of the Yulin area recognized the superiority of dam land and launched a high tide of dam building in the gullies in 1956. Up to now, nearly 20,000 large, medium, and small silt dams have been built, creating more than 65,000 mu of dam land. Because the dam land is flat, fertile, strong in drought resistance and moisture retention, and easy to cultivate, the grain yield is high, and the masses generally reflect that "building dams is like building granaries, increasing land and increasing grain."

    In the loess plateau gully area, the area of gullies occupies half or even far more than half of the plateau area. More than 80 percent of the sediment here comes from the erosion of the gullies themselves, and only 20 percent comes from the plateau surface. Therefore, dams should also be built in the gullies to achieve the purpose of siltation and comprehensive sediment control.

    The Ximawan Ravine in Jingbian County, Yulin area, has more than 20,000 mu of flat ravine land. The surrounding hills appear scattered and low. The outlet of the ravine is connected to the Lu River. The water flowing into the ravine from the surrounding mountains is all retained by the ravine land, and none of it flows into the Lu River. The people living here are much better off than those in the surrounding mountainous areas, with an average of 700 to 1,000 jin of grain per person. Looking at the Ximawan Ravine, one is reminded of the prospects of building dams for siltation in the gullies. As the dam body is continuously raised and the dam land gradually expands, it is possible to silt it up into a wide dam land like the Ximawan Ravine. Turning barren gullies into flat land in the thousands of gullies in the Northwest region is the only effective way to increase the arable land area in the Northwest. We need to put forward the slogans of "demanding land from hilly gullies and plateau gullies" and "returning me to the original land" to realize the original gully land. This is of great significance for changing the face of the water and soil erosion areas in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and building a new socialist Northwest.

    Building dams in gullies is not only because it can silt up a large amount of land and increase the agricultural base in the Northwest, but also because silt dams play a very important role in fundamentally controlling the Yellow River.

    The fact that the Loess Plateau in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has been cut by water into a plateau gully area, and has even evolved into a hilly gully area, has already shown the severity of gully erosion in soil erosion. Under the erosion of slope water and gully water, the gully areas in the Northwest are still constantly expanding and developing. The amount of gully erosion accounts for 50 to 90 percent of the total amount of erosion in the basin. In order to reduce the sediment in the Yellow River, we must prevent gully erosion and intercept sediment flowing out of the gullies in the gullies themselves. In order to achieve this goal, we must vigorously promote large, medium, and small different types of silt dam projects in the gullies of water and soil erosion areas.

    Small and medium-sized silt dams are silt dams that control smaller basin areas. In the tributary and capillary ditches with steep slopes and severe gully erosion, small silt dams or medium-sized silt dams are built section by section to achieve terracing of the gully bottom. In addition to retaining sediment and creating land, they also reduce the gradient of the gully bottom and prevent gully scouring and downcutting. Large silt dams refer to silt dams that control larger basin areas. Building large silt dams in the middle and lower reaches of the main and larger tributaries can control the sediment transported downstream throughout the gully. The construction of silt dams raises the erosion base level of the gullies, controls the intensity of surface cutting, and shortens the possible length of gully development, thus reducing the possibility of gully expansion and development, and the sediment input to the Yellow River can be greatly reduced.

    In order to achieve long-term sediment retention benefits and continuously expand the area of dam land and increase agricultural production in dam land, silt dams must be raised step by step in a planned manner after the upstream reservoir capacity of the dam is filled with silt. Failure to raise the dam land after it is filled with silt loses the role and significance of using silt dams to retain sediment and develop dam land. Allowing the flood to discharge fertile soil from the spillway each year will reduce the agricultural yield of the dam land, which is inconsistent with the interests of production and Yellow River management.

    The masses already have relatively rich experience in raising and utilizing small silt dams. Recently, many effective mass measures have also emerged for the management and utilization of large and medium-sized silt dams. In order to facilitate the height increase of the dam top, large silt dams can omit the spillway and only build a tower-style water intake well and a drainage tunnel. In the initial stage after the dam top is raised, only summer crops are planted on the dam land, and attention is paid to improving the drainage performance of the dam land drainage ditches and spillway structures to ensure agricultural harvests. During the flood season, the dam land is used to store floodwater and retain sediment, and clear water is discharged after the flood, or a portion of sediment is allowed to flow out. As the dam land is raised and the dam land area continues to expand, the siltation thickness and the flood depth will obviously decrease to a certain extent. At this time, we can start planting autumn crops on the dam land. Because the dam land area is getting larger and larger and the dam land siltation thickness is getting smaller and smaller, the height to which the dam top is raised will eventually reach a very small level.

    The superiority of silt dams in terms of sediment retention is reflected in the fact that their sediment retention effect is fast and thorough. As long as a large silt dam is built at the gully mouth, or several silt dams are built in the gully, the sediment in the entire gully upstream can be quickly controlled. Therefore, in a gully basin, closely combining the gully management work mainly based on building silt dams with the widespread water and soil conservation work on the surface is the most effective way to achieve mountain and gully management, develop agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production in mountainous areas, change the appearance of mountains and gullies, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    According to rough estimates, widely building large silt dams for gullies in the water and soil erosion areas in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, combining large, medium, and small silt dams, and gradually raising them in a planned manner can stop the development of gullies and control 60 to 70 percent of the sediment discharged to the Yellow River, and just building dams at the gully mouths can create millions of mu of fertile land.

    解决黄河泥沙问题的重要途径
    黄河水利委员会副主任　李赋都
    黄河的症结是泥沙问题
    黄河是世界上一条最著名的多泥沙河流，在历史上也是世界上一条危害最厉害的河流。它的危害性表现在两个方面：
    黄河中游三门峡以上的广大黄土区水土流失很严重。每年被水冲下来的泥沙平均就有十六亿吨。这真是举世无比的惊人数字！在这个地区里又约有二十多万平方公里的地区，包括黄河河口镇到龙门间的干支流，洛河永宁山以上，泾河东庄以上和渭河宝鸡峡以上等流域，水土流失特别严重。这些地区每年供给黄河的泥沙量平均就有十四亿多吨，占全河下输流沙总量十六亿吨的百分之八十八。
    黄河中游年雨量不多，但大都集中在七、八、九月，而且暴雨特多。大量的黄土被水冲走，平整的原地被水割切成无数的沟壑。在高原沟壑区有一半以上的土地都成了深沟，原上的耕地面积越来越小。在冲蚀更严重的丘陵地带，我们所看到的全是千沟万壑和分割成为一块一块的黄土山丘。这些黄土丘陵沟壑区有的是童山秃岭，人迹稀少；有的是人烟稠密，广种薄收，整个山坡都被开垦了，结果植物被覆，荡然无存，三料（饲料、肥料、燃料）具缺，十年九旱，人民生活不能迅速提高。这是一方面。
    另一方面，黄河中游的肥沃土壤被水冲到河里，最后被河水带到坡度平缓的黄河下游，就大量的沉淀下来，使黄河下游两堤之间的河床不断地抬高，成为“地上河”，加重了整个黄河下游的危机，遇到较大洪水就要发生决口、泛滥以至于改道。所以黄河下游在历史上就以水灾严重和频繁闻名于世。由于黄河下游淤成一条地上河，使广大平原地区失去了利用黄河排水的可能性，这样就会抬高河床两边农田的地下水位，使临黄地带发生盐碱化。治理河流，除害兴利的一般方法是在河流上修坝拦洪，蓄水发电和在坝下游发展灌溉，并通过河道整治和梯级开发等措施，达到防洪、航运、发电、排水，发展沿河农田水利等综合利用的目的。但是在黄河流域，由于河水所含的泥沙太多，这些办法都行不通。修坝蓄水，水库很快地被淤满了；对强行河道的梯级开发，结果加速了河道的淤积，减小了河床的防洪能力，增加了两岸农田排水的困难和盐碱化的程度。黄河下游河道整治工作，本来是为了刷深河槽，增加水深，降低河水位，变地上河为地下河，以利泄洪、航运和排水。但是，在泥沙特多，冲刷能力随着河水含泥量的增加而减小的情况下，整治也无济于事，河道仍然不免于堆积和抬高。
    在黄河水位没有被调节，泥沙没有被适当地减少以前，黄河下游广大华北平原地区的灌溉事业也不能大量发展。从黄河引水，由于河道的淤积和摆动无常，得不到保障；灌溉渠道在异常平坦的平原地区，难免于淤塞。尤其严重的是平原地区的河道排水条件很差，从黄河引出大量的水，大部分排不出去，广大地区的盐碱化不能消除。举办大规模的放淤工程，也因为渠道的淤积和排水的困难而害多利少。同时引黄灌溉工程，还会给黄河带来河床淤淀更加严重的危机。
    治理黄河不能套用一般的治河方法
    以上这些经验和教训，说明了一个很重要的问题，就是黄河问题的症结是泥沙问题。由于黄河泥沙特多，我们就不能把治理河流和利用河流的一般方法和措施生硬地套用在黄河上。这样做一定会给我们带来失望，而得到与愿相反的不利后果。毛主席教导我们：“如果不研究矛盾的特殊性，就无从确定一事物不同于他事物的特殊的本质，就无从发现事物运动发展的特殊的原因，或特殊的根据”。我们在治黄工作的实践中，找出了黄河问题的症结，找出了西北黄土地区严重的水土流失是黄河问题中矛盾的主要方面，它不仅是黄河中游地区干旱贫困的根源，而且也是根治黄河和开发黄河的关键。治黄工作必须针对着这个症结，对症下药。首先从解决泥沙问题，就是说，从处理每年平均从水土流失地区冲下来的十六亿吨的泥沙着手，才能够使黄河由害河变为利河。根据这个原则，我们提出了在中游拦泥蓄水、在下游防洪排沙，以拦为主的治河总方向。实现这一治河方向所采用的方法，除积极地推进黄河中游水土流失地区的水土保持工作，减少泥沙的生成以外，就是在这个地区大力开展以打淤地坝为主的沟壑治理工作，并在水土流失严重的支流和黄河三门峡以上干流的适当河段，修建拦泥库。
    在黄河中游，农业较为发达，人民生活较好和人口较密的地区，主要是河谷川地，其次就是已经被水割切并且还在不断缩小的残余黄土原地。但是这些地区在广大的黄土地区里仅仅占着很小的比重。绝大多数地区的主要问题是缺乏平地的问题。宁夏回族自治区清水河长山头坝淤地的事例，就很明显地说明了这一问题。在清水河流域山峁重迭，沟壑纵横，极端缺乏耕地的地区，泥沙淤积的结果，出现了两万五千多亩的大片平整土地，并且在去年夏季获得了一万六千亩的农业大丰收，这是多么令人欢欣振奋的景象啊。
    拿陕北和晋西来说，这些地区的黄河两岸各支流流域是供给黄河泥沙的主要地区。这些地区大部分都是黄土丘陵沟壑区，水土流失非常严重。这里虽然也有河川平地，但是分布零星，面积很小。就以榆林专区来说，在无定河等河干支流的川地里，解放以来，虽然大力地开展了灌溉事业，差不多所有的河滩地都修了渠，浇了地，为人民所利用，但是还远远不能解决人民生活的需要。
    闸沟打坝，增产治黄
    黄河水利委员会从一九五三年到一九五五年在绥德无定河的支沟韭园沟修建了五座大型淤地坝，控制了韭园沟全沟的流域面积。经过历年几次的加高，截至一九六四年，这些坝就拦蓄泥沙五百多万立方米，淤出肥沃坝地六百多亩。自从一九五九年起，群众就在坝地上种庄稼。在一九六二年和一九六五年异常干旱的情况下，庄稼仍然长的特别旺盛，显示出坝地突出的优越性。一般来说坝地的单位面积产量要比水平梯田高出二倍到三倍，要比山坡地高出四倍到五倍。
    榆林专区的人民认识到坝地的优越性，从一九五六年起就掀起了在沟里打坝的高潮。到现在为止，已打了大、中、小型淤地坝近二万多座，淤地六万五千多亩。由于坝地平坦肥沃，抗旱保墒能力强，耕作方便，粮食打的多，群众普遍反映说：“打坝如修仓，增地又增粮。”
    在黄土高原沟壑区，沟壑的面积侵占了高原面积的一半，甚至远远超过一半以上。这里百分之八十以上的泥沙是从沟壑本身的冲刷而来，只有百分之二十的泥沙来自原面，所以也应当在沟里打坝，以达到淤地和全面控制泥沙的目的。
    榆林专区靖边县的席麻湾涧有二万多亩的平坦涧地。周围山丘显得零落低矮。涧地出口接连芦河。群众在涧里打横堰。周围山区的水流到涧里，全被涧地留用，没有一点流到芦河里去。这里的人民生活比周围山区好得多，每人平均就有七百到一千斤粮食。看了席麻湾涧，就令人联想到在沟里打坝淤地的远景。随着坝身不断加高，坝地逐渐扩大，最后同席麻湾涧一样，淤成宽阔的坝地，是可能的。在西北地区的千沟万壑里，把荒沟变成平川地，是增加西北耕地面积唯一有效的途径。我们需要提出“向丘陵沟壑和高原沟壑要地”和“还我原地”的口号，实现沟壑原地化。这对改变黄河中游水土流失地区的面貌和建设社会主义新西北，有着非常重大的意义。
    在沟里打坝不只是因为可以淤出大量的土地，增加西北的农业基地，同时，淤地坝在根治黄河方面也起着非常重要的作用。
    黄河中游黄土高原被水切割成为高原沟壑区，甚至演变成为丘陵沟壑区的这一事实，已说明了沟道冲刷在土壤侵蚀中的严重性。西北的沟壑区在坡水和沟水的侵蚀下，仍然在不断地扩大与发展。沟道冲刷的数量，占着流域侵蚀总量的百分之五十到百分之九十。为了减少黄河的泥沙，我们就必须在沟壑本身防止沟身的冲刷和拦截出沟的泥沙。为了达到这个目的，我们也就必须在水土流失地区的沟壑里，大力推进大、中、小不同类型的淤地坝工程。
    小、中型淤地坝是控制流域面积较小的淤地坝。在坡度陡，沟冲很厉害的支沟毛沟里，节节修小型淤地坝或中型淤地坝，实现沟底梯台化，除了拦泥淤地外，还在于减小沟底的比降，防止沟身的淘刷与下切。大型淤地坝指的是控制流域面积较大的淤地坝。在干沟和较大支沟的中下游修建大型淤地坝，就可以控制全沟下输的泥沙。淤地坝的修建，抬高了沟壑的侵蚀基准，控制了地表切割的强度，缩短了沟壑可能发展的长度，因而也就减小了沟壑扩大和发展的可能性，输入黄河的泥沙就可大大减少。
    为了长期收到拦泥的效益和不断扩大坝地的面积，增加坝地农业生产，淤地坝在坝上游库容淤满后就必须有计划地逐次加高。坝地淤满后不加高便失去了利用淤地坝拦泥和发展坝地的作用和意义。每年让洪水把肥沃的土壤从溢洪道排泄下去，会使坝地农业产量降低，这与生产和治黄的利益都是不符合的。
    小型淤地坝的加高和运用，群众已经有了比较丰富的经验。近来对大、中型淤地坝的管理运用，也出现了许多有效的群众性的措施。为了便于坝顶的加高，大型淤地坝可以不要溢洪道而只修塔式进水井和排水洞。在坝顶加高后的初期，坝地只种夏季作物，并注意改进坝地排水沟和泄水建筑物的排水效能，保证农业的收获。而在汛期则利用坝地蓄洪拦泥，洪水过后放泄清水或容许一部泥沙泄流出去。随着坝地的淤高和坝地面积不断扩大，到了一定的程度以后，淤积厚度和洪水的深度就会显然减小。到了这个时候，我们就可以开始在坝地上种秋季作物。由于坝地面积越来越大，坝地淤积厚度越来越小，到了最后，坝顶加高的高度也就会达到很小的程度。
    淤地坝在拦泥方面的优越性，表现在它的拦泥作用来得快，而且彻底。在沟口只要修上一个大型淤地坝，或者在沟里修上几座淤地坝，就可以很快把上游全沟的泥沙控制住，因此，在一个沟壑流域里，把以打淤地坝为主的沟壑治理工作，同普遍开展的面上的水土保持工作密切地结合起来，是达到治山治沟，发展山区农、林、牧业生产，改变山、沟面貌，达到多快好省的最有效的办法。
    根据粗略估计，在黄河中游水土流失地区广泛地修建沟壑大型淤地坝，把大、中、小型淤地坝结合起来，并有计划地逐步加高，就可以停止沟壑的发展，控制下输到黄河去的泥沙的百分之六十到百分之七十，而仅仅沟口打坝一项，就可淤出几百万亩的肥沃土地。
