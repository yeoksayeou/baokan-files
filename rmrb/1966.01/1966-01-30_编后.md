    Editor's Note
    Key figures in the Japanese Sato government have repeatedly advocated that Japan should strengthen its military power to obtain "the right to speak." They claim that Japan's diplomacy would be "easier" if it had military power as a "backing," just like the "Japanese Empire" of the past. These murderous clamors nakedly expose the sinister ambition of Japanese militarists to relive their old dreams of aggression.
    All reactionaries are believers in military power. They always believe that with military power, their affairs will be easier to handle. In the past, Japanese militarists relied on their military power to launch wars of aggression in Asia. As a result, their affairs did not go well, and they ultimately suffered a shameful defeat. The likes of Sato have not learned anything from the fate of their predecessors and still arrogantly want to rely on military power to rebuild the "Japanese Empire." This shows that reactionaries will never learn from history and repent.
    Today's Asia is very different from the 1930s. The military power of US imperialism is not small, but it is deeply mired and at a dead end in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The likes of Sato, with the support of US imperialism, are accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism, willingly acting as accomplices in US aggression, and vainly attempting to run rampant in Asia again. They will certainly not have a good outcome. No matter how much they strengthen their military power, compared to the Japanese militarists of the past, such as Tojo, their affairs will only be more difficult to handle, and their fate will only be more tragic.

    编后
    日本佐藤政府的要员接连鼓吹：日本要通过加强军事力量来取得“发言权”；日本的外交象过去“日本帝国”那样有军事力量作“后盾”，事情就“好办”了。这些杀气腾腾的叫嚣，露骨地暴露了日本军国主义者企图重温侵略旧梦的罪恶野心。
    一切反动派，都是迷信于军事力量的。他们总认为，有了军事力量，他们的事情就会好办了。过去，日本军国主义者凭着他们的军事力量在亚洲发动侵略战争，结果他们的事情并不好办，最后遭到了可耻的失败。佐藤之流并没有从他们前辈的下场中学到任何东西，依旧狂妄地想依靠军事力量来重建“日本帝国”。这表明，反动派是决不会吸取历史教训而回心向善的。
    今天的亚洲比起三十年代来已经大大不同了。美帝国主义的军事力量不能算小，可是在侵略越南的战争中却是深陷泥淖、走投无路。佐藤之流在美帝国主义的扶植下加速复活日本军国主义，甘心充当美国的侵略帮凶，妄图再次在亚洲横行，肯定是不会有什么好结果的。不管他们怎样加强军事力量，比起当年的日本军国主义者东条之流来，他们的事情只会更加不好办，他们的下场只会更加悲惨。
