    Publicize Mao Zedong Thought  Disseminate Cultural and Scientific Knowledge
    Comprehensive Popular Magazine "Rural Culture" Launched
    (Xinhua News Agency)  To meet the needs of the socialist education movement and the cultural revolution, the comprehensive rural popular magazine "Rural Culture" was launched, with the first issue published in Beijing on the 6th.
    "Rural Culture" is published monthly, targeting rural cadres, educated youth, and active rural cultural activists as its primary readership.  Its mission is to closely coordinate with the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, to publicize Mao Zedong Thought, conduct political and ideological education, disseminate cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge, and introduce revolutionary stories, slides, and literary performance materials.  In terms of form, it strives to be rich in illustrations, readable, teachable, and usable.
    The inaugural issue of "Rural Culture" features special articles written by Chen Yonggui and other Party branch secretaries and Communist Youth League branch secretaries from seven advanced agricultural units. In their articles, they used the heroic deeds of commune members relying on their own efforts and striving for progress to point out the truth that only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought can we be invincible.  The authors of these articles expressed their confidence that they would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, promote the spirit of Dazhai, and welcome the Third Five-Year Plan.
    This issue of "Rural Culture" also focuses on introducing the revolutionary spirit shown by commune members in the suburbs of Beijing in promoting the great leap forward in agriculture. The publication will also introduce the deeds and advanced experiences of Dazhai-type agricultural units across the country in succession.
    In the "Living Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works" section, this issue of "Rural Culture" specifically discusses the issue of farming for the revolution and published three pieces of understanding from brigade and team cadres and commune members in studying Chairman Mao's works, as well as the comic strip "Chairman Mao's Good Soldier - Wang Jie."
    "Rural Culture" has a "Blackboard News" column, which uses short, concise, lively forms to conduct current affairs propaganda to commune members and provide propaganda materials for rural blackboard newspapers.
    In order to cooperate with the Spring Festival propaganda, the inaugural issue specifically provides some literary performance materials, including "Ten Learn from Dazhai" (duet), "Ode to Wang Jie" (lyrics), "Guarding the Pass" (storytelling and singing) reflecting the current rural class struggle, a clapper talk "Nowhere to Go" describing the predicament of American imperialism under the fierce attacks of the South Vietnamese people, "Record of Naval Annihilation" (crosstalk) praising our People's Navy for sinking Chiang gang warships, and the revolutionary story "Heroic Father and Son" reflecting the lives of the People's Liberation Army and militiamen.  This magazine also has columns on militia military knowledge, agricultural technical knowledge, and health knowledge.
    "Rural Culture" underwent four trial publications before its launch. During the creation process, the editorial staff went deep into the countryside, widely listened to the opinions of local Party committees and rural readers, and received strong support from relevant departments.  The staff of post offices, Xinhua bookstores, and printing factories across the country also devoted their greatest efforts to doing a good job in the publication and distribution of this magazine, with full enthusiasm to serve the five hundred million peasants.
