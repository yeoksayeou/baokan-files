    Daring to "Display One's Skill Before an Expert"
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Heating Worker Zhang Gongxing

    In the upsurge of learning from Daqing, catching up with Daqing, and establishing Daqing-style enterprises, a mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement is flourishing. Observing the situation, there is a heroic spirit of "ordering the opening of the way by the Three Mountains and Five Peaks; here I come!"
    However, some people dare not "order," and naturally, they cannot "come." What is the reason? The answer is: incorrect thinking. They believe that some things are beyond the capabilities of engineers and technicians, and they dare not act rashly. Who do we think we are? How dare we display our skill before an expert.
    I believe that daring to make revolution means daring to display one's skill before an expert. Combining revolutionary spirit with a scientific attitude can lead to creation and achievement. Isn't that so? When the No. 2 Steel Plant was test-rolling round steel using the original rolling mill, they encountered "roadblocks." These "roadblocks" glared menacingly, but the comrades of No. 2 Steel Plant ignored them, daring to stroke the tiger's backside and brandishing their axes before the "experts." Innovating and eliminating the old, daring to catch up and surpass, as a result, they not only rolled round steel but also rolled deformed steel.
    The No. 1 Rolling Mill is a new plant with completely new equipment and a high degree of mechanization, but some people think there is nothing "new" to "revolutionize." Worker Chen Renyi refused to accept this, studied Chairman Mao's teaching about making discoveries, inventions, creations, and advancements, and boldly carried out three innovations, all of which succeeded, making the new equipment even newer.
    Examples are countless. In a word, thought governs action. As long as we liberate our minds, establish revolutionary vigor, break down superstitions, sweep away authoritative thinking, respect science, and dare to practice, we can become the masters who dominate everything in the world.

### 敢于“班门弄斧”

    敢于“班门弄斧”
    马钢加热工  张功兴
    在学大庆、赶大庆，办大庆式企业的热潮中，一个群众性的技术革新技术革命运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地兴起。观其形势，大有“喝令三山五岳开道，我来了”之豪迈气概。
    但也有些人不敢“喝令”，自然也就“来”不了。原因何在？答曰：想法不对头。他们认为有些事连工程师、技术员都无能为力，不敢轻举妄动，我们算老几？哪敢班门弄斧。
    我以为，敢于革命，就敢于班门弄斧。把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，就能有所创造，有所作为。不是吗？二钢厂在用原轧钢机试轧元钢的时候，就曾遇到过“拦路虎”。这些“拦路虎”虎视眈眈，好不威风，但二钢的同志毫不理睬，敢于摸老虎屁股，当着“班门”耍起了大斧。创新除旧，敢赶敢超，结果，他们不仅把元钢轧出来了，螺纹钢也轧出来了。
    一轧钢厂是个设备全新，机械化程度高的新厂，可是有的人认为无“新”可“革”。工人陈仁义不服这口气，学习了毛主席关于有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进的教导，大胆搞了三项革新，结果一一成功，使新设备新上加新。
    例，举不胜举，一句话，思想支配行动，只要解放思想，树革命锐气，打破迷信，扫权威思想，尊重科学，敢于实践，就能成为主宰世上一切的主人。
