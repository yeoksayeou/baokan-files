    "Little Tiger" Grows Wings
    Worker at the First Tractor Factory, Wang Tianqi
    Ever since the workshop launched the campaign to learn from the high-quality, high-yield model worker Li Honglu, Liu Haijun, a young worker who used to love to talk and laugh, suddenly became taciturn. What was the reason for this?
    Liu Haijun, this simple and honest young man, was bold and daring when he worked, and full of ideas. In 1961, he processed a batch of workpieces, surpassing the output of ordinary people by two times. At the time, many people said that his fierce energy was like a "tiger." From then on, he got the nickname "Little Tiger."
    As the saying goes, "There are mountains beyond mountains, and people beyond people." Although Little Tiger could be considered a skilled worker in the workshop, he was somewhat inferior when compared to Li Honglu, a high-quality, high-yield expert in the entire factory. At first, he didn't pay much attention to this, thinking, "He is a master worker, with high skills and rich experience. How can I compare with him!"
    With the deepening of the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, "Little Tiger" became increasingly restless. In Li Honglu's advanced deeds, "Little Tiger" learned a lot of experience, which made him understand how advanced things are obtained, that is, one must have strong thinking and a revolutionary spirit of daring to break through.
    That night, the alarm clock pointed to one o'clock, but Little Tiger was still not asleep. He thought about how the Party had cultivated him after he entered the factory, making a child from the old society a member of the Communist Youth League and then joining the Communist Party... Finally, he compared himself with Li Honglu again. Li Honglu is a fifth-grade worker; he is a second-grade worker, but they are both doing a common cause, both having turned from a suffering child into masters of the country. Why can't I establish the confidence to surpass? Thinking of this, he made up his mind to work hard and surpass Li Honglu!
    Coincidentally, at this time, the work section leader gave Little Tiger an urgent processing task of two hundred large shafts, requiring twenty pieces to be processed every shift.
    But things didn't go as planned. Only three pieces were processed on the first day. The more Little Tiger thought about it, the more anxious he became. That night, in order to consider improving the processing method and reforming the tools, he didn't fall asleep for half the night.
    Early the next morning, he came to the machine tool, experimenting and working at the same time, busy from morning to night, and only processed six pieces, far from the required amount. So he sought advice everywhere and even invited Li Honglu to the machine tool to provide guidance in person. Based on everyone's experience combined with his own processing situation, he modified a tool that night, and processed thirty-four pieces the next day.
    When Little Tiger handed over two hundred qualified products on the eighth day, the comrades all praised, "Little Tiger has now grown wings and is flying!"

### “小老虎”插翅

    “小老虎”插翅
    第一拖拉机厂工人　王天奇
    自从车间掀起向优质高产标兵李洪禄学习的活动以后，一贯爱说爱笑的青年工人刘海军，却一下子变得沉默寡言了，这是什么原因呢？
    刘海军这个纯朴憨厚的小伙子，干起活来猛冲猛打，敢想敢闯。一九六一年他加工一批活，比一般人高出两倍。当时不少人都说他这股猛劲真象一只“虎”。从此，就落了个“小老虎”的称号。
    俗话说：“山外有山，人上有人。”小老虎在车间尽管也算能手，但是要和全厂优质高产能手李洪禄比起来，就有点差劲。起初他对这些并不在意，心想：“人家是老师傅，技术高，经验丰富，咱咋能和人家比呢！”
    随着比学赶帮超运动的深入开展，“小老虎”越来越稳不住舵了。在李洪禄的先进事迹中，“小老虎”学到了不少经验，使他懂得了先进的东西是怎样得来的，那就是必须有过硬的思想，有革命的闯劲。
    这天夜里，闹钟已指向一点了，小老虎还没睡着。他想到进厂后党是如何培养他的，使一个旧社会的苦孩子入了团、又加入了共产党……最后，他又拿自己和李洪禄比较。李洪禄是五级工；自己是二级工，但是，干的都是共同的事业，都是由一个苦孩子翻身做了主人。我为什么不能树立超的信心呢？想到这里，他下定决心，要大干一场，超过李洪禄！
    凑巧在这个时候，工段长给小老虎下达了二百件大轴的紧急加工任务，每班必须加工出二十件来。
    哪知事与愿违，第一天只加工了三件。小老虎越想越急。这天晚上，为了考虑改进加工方法和改革刀具，他半夜都没睡着。
    第二天一大早，他就来到机床旁，一边试验一边干，从早忙到晚，也只加工六件，距离要求还差得很远。于是他就到处取经，还请李洪禄到机床边亲临指导。他根据大家的经验结合自己的加工情况，当天晚上改制了一种刀具，第二天就加工了三十四件。
    当在第八天小老虎交出了二百件合格的产品时，同志们无不称赞：“小老虎如今长上翅膀飞起来了！”
