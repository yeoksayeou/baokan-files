Editor's Note: "Of all the changes, the unchanging is the prominence of politics, the unchanging is the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's writings." This is the understanding of the soldiers, the language of the soldiers. To be able to propose such profound understanding, such clear language, fully illustrates that the soldiers' flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's writings have yielded gratifying insights and gains.

The articles by Comrades Wang Chuan You, Luo Mao Kun, Dong Xiao Hai, and Wu Jia Xi published in this newspaper today are their心得录 [records of心得], and also their resolutions. They are records of心得, because they deeply feel that whether it is training, fighting, or "passing on the family line," or mutual assistance and mutual learning, all the good results have been achieved because of earnestly highlighting politics and flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, so they want to write down this心得 [insight], to educate themselves and encourage everyone. They are resolutions, because they have truly tasted the "sweetness" of highlighting politics and flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, and deeply feel that it is necessary to consciously do better in order to greatly advance all aspects of work, so they want to write down this resolution, to spur themselves and promote everyone. What they are doing is very right.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for all our work. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. To achieve this requirement, we must consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's writings flexibly, and especially work hard on the word "application." The Liberation Army soldiers have made such a resolution, and we must all make such a resolution.

Never Break the Line, Never Lose the Tradition

Wang Chuan You, Instructor of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" of the People's Liberation Army

Since April 1963, when the Ministry of National Defense named our company "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," our company members have undergone great changes. Old soldiers are constantly transferred, retired, and discharged, and new soldiers are constantly joining.

With personnel changing, how can we take over properly and achieve what Vice Chairman Lin Biao proposed: "Organization does not break the line, experience is not lost?" In several years of work, we deeply feel that the key lies in forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is what the soldiers often say: of all the changes, the unchanging is the prominence of politics, the unchanging is the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's writings, and in these "unchanging things," combined with new situations, we must constantly develop, advance, and improve.

Whenever old soldiers are transferred or retire, and new soldiers enlist, in addition to doing a good job of handing over, we especially do five "firsts" for each new soldier: the first gift: a book of Chairman Mao's writings, a sewing kit, an envelope pasted with waste newspaper; the first class meeting, organized to study "Serve the People" to establish the idea of ​​thorough revolution; the first political class in the company's honor room, also talking about the article "Serve the People", telling the new soldiers that the Eighth Company started by studying Chairman Mao's writings, without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no Eighth Company; the first heart-to-heart talk, introducing the experiences of the old soldiers in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and how to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and plain living of our army; the first group meeting, talking about how the members of the Communist Youth League should study and apply Chairman Mao's writings flexibly, and play an exemplary leading role. In this way, the new soldiers are rooted correctly and embark on the right path as soon as they enlist.

When organizing new soldiers to study Chairman Mao's writings, according to the instructions of the Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin Biao on studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings flexibly, and especially working hard on the word "application," we adopt the method of "read first, discuss second, compare third, and act fourth," bringing up problems, "putting ourselves in," "revealing" our thoughts, and also "seeing blood with刺刀 [bayonets]," vigorously promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism, and promoting the ideological revolution of soldiers. Wang Gen Tu, a new soldier who enlisted last year, was not very settled in his work when he first arrived at the company. After he studied "Serve the People", "On Contradiction" and other works, his awareness was greatly improved, and he gradually established the idea of "revolution first, work first, others first," and often quietly did good deeds for comrades in the班 [squad]. Wang Gen Tu's心得 [insight] is: the proletarian ideology must be accumulated bit by bit, doing a good deed is sharpening one's own thinking.

The new soldiers who come to our company are all young students and young farmers in their late teens. They were all born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, and have not personally experienced the exploitation and oppression of the old society. In view of this situation, we have always regarded class education as an important part of education. Whenever a batch of new soldiers enlist, we invite old workers, old poor and lower-middle peasants, and old soldiers to talk about the "three histories"; taking advantage of family members coming to the company, the company going to the countryside to work, going out camping, or visiting factories in Shanghai, the Bund, People's Square and other places with educational significance, we engage in visiting the poor and asking about suffering, recalling and comparing, remembering the bitterness and thinking about the sweetness; we ask each new soldier to talk about family history, write family history, and clarify their own "suffering accounts" and "happiness accounts," so that they realize that although they have no scars from dog bites or traces of whipping by landlords or capitalists, their parents suffered all kinds of oppression and suffered all kinds of hardship, and today's rivers and mountains did not come easily, and they must never forget the past, so as to fundamentally improve the class consciousness of the new soldiers. In addition, we often invite old leaders and old soldiers of the company to give reports and talk about revolutionary traditions; every year on the naming day of the Good Eighth Company, we conduct mass inspections of inheriting revolutionary traditions, establish pace-setters, commend advanced individuals, and conduct live revolutionary tradition education, passing on the style of hard struggle to the new soldiers in every possible way, growing the thoughts of the proletariat, and establishing the determination to serve the people wholeheartedly and to carry the revolution through to the end.

When soldiers are promoted to cadres or cadres are promoted, we also focus on conducting education of "three unchanging things": the true color of an ordinary soldier does not change; a red heart for serving the people does not change; the style of hard struggle does not change. At the same time, it is emphasized that cadres should look to the low standards in life and the high standards in politics, grasp these "fundamentals" and "cores," and hand over the班 [squad] properly.

We deeply know: everything we do is what a revolutionary soldier should do, and we have not done many things well, and we are still far from the requirements of the Party and the people. Recently, through studying Vice Chairman Lin Biao's five principles on this year's work and the editorial of the Liberation Army Daily, our direction for the future has become clearer. We are determined to hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unswervingly and firmly implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions, highlight politics, flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, work hard on the word "application," and pass on the fine traditions of our Party and our army from generation to generation, never break the line, and never lose the tradition!

### 永不断线  永不失传

专栏：

    编者按：“千变万变，突出政治不变，活学活用毛主席著作不变。”这是战士的认识、战士的语言。能够提出这样深刻的认识、这样明确的语言，充分说明战士们活学活用毛主席著作，有了可喜的心得和收获。
    本报今天登载的王传友、罗茂坤、董小海、吴加溪等四位同志的文章，是他们的心得录，也是他们的决心书。说是心得录，是因为他们深深感到不管训练、打仗，还是“传宗接代”、互帮互学，凡是取得了好的成绩，都是由于认真突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，所以要把这个心得写下来，教育自己，勉励大家。说是决心书，是因为他们真正吃到了突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的“甜头”，深深感到必须有意识地作得更好，才能把各方面的工作大大推进一步，所以要把这个决心写下来，鞭策自己，推动大家。他们作得是很对的。
    毛泽东思想是我们各项工作的指针。我们一定要用毛泽东思想统帅一切。要实现这个要求，就必须自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫。解放军战士下了这样的决心，我们大家都要下这样的决心。
    永不断线  永不失传
    解放军“南京路上好八连”指导员  王传友
    从一九六三年四月国防部命名我连为“南京路上好八连”以来，我们连队成员有了很大变化。老战士不断调动、转业、复员，新战士不断参加进来。
    人员变了，怎样才能接好班，做到林彪副主席提出的“组织不断线、经验不失传”？在几年工作中，我们深深感到：关键在于永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，也就是象战士们常说的：千变万变，突出政治不变，活学活用毛主席著作不变，而且要在这些“不变”中，结合新的情况，不断有所发展，有所前进，有所提高。
    每当老战士调动、退伍，新战士入伍时，我们除了做好交接班外，对每个新战士特别要做好五个“第一”的工作：第一件礼物：一本毛主席著作、一个针线包、一个废报纸糊的信封；第一次班务会，组织学习《为人民服务》，树立革命到底的思想；第一堂在连队荣誉室上的政治课，也是讲《为人民服务》这篇文章，告诉新战士，八连就是学习毛主席著作起家的，没有毛泽东思想，就没有我们八连；第一次谈心会，介绍连队老战士学习毛主席著作的体会经验，以及怎样保持发扬我军艰苦朴素的优良传统；第一次团小组会，讲团员、青年应该怎样活学活用毛主席著作，起模范带头作用。这样使新战士一入伍就扎正根子，走上正路。
    在组织新战士学习毛主席著作时，我们根据军委和林彪副主席活学活用毛主席著作、特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫的指示，采取“一读二议三对照四行动”的办法，带着问题，把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，也要“刺刀见红”，大力兴无灭资，推动战士思想革命化。去年入伍的新战士王根土，刚到连队时不太安心工作，以后他学习了《为人民服务》、《矛盾论》等著作，觉悟大大提高，逐步树立起“革命第一、工作第一、他人第一”的思想，经常悄悄地为班里同志做好事。王根土的体会是：无产阶级思想要一点一滴地积累，做一件好事，就是磨练一次自己的思想。
    到我们连队来的新战士，都是些十八九岁的青年学生、青年农民，他们都是生在新社会，长在红旗下，旧社会的剥削压迫都没有亲身经历过。针对这样的情况，我们一直把阶级教育作为教育的重要内容。每当一批新战士入伍时，我们就请老工人、老贫下中农、老战士谈“三史”；利用家属来队、连队到农村劳动、外出野营的机会，或参观上海的工厂以及外滩、人民广场等有教育意义的地方的机会，搞访贫问苦，回忆对比，忆苦思甜；要每个新战士谈家史，写家史，弄清自己的“苦情账”、“幸福账”，使他们认识到，自己身上虽没有地主、资本家狗咬的伤疤，鞭打的痕迹，但自己的父辈却受尽了压迫，吃尽了苦，今天的江山得来不易，千万不能忘记过去，这样从根本上提高新战士的阶级觉悟。另外，我们还经常请连队的老首长、老战士作报告，讲革命传统；每年在好八连的命名日都要搞群众性的继承革命传统大检查，树立标兵，表扬先进，进行活的革命传统教育，把艰苦奋斗的作风，千方百计地传给新战士，长无产阶级的思想，树立全心全意为人民服务、革命到底的决心。
    当战士提升作干部或干部提升时，我们也着重进行“三不变”的教育：普通一兵的本色不变；为人民服务的一颗红心不变；艰苦奋斗的作风不变。同时强调干部在生活上要向低标准看齐，政治上向高标准看齐，抓住这些“根本”、“核心”，把班接好。
    我们深知：我们所做的一切都是一个革命战士应该做的，有许多工作我们还做得不好，离党和人民的要求还很远。最近我们通过学习林彪副主席关于今年工作的五项原则和解放军报的社论，对今后的方向更明确了。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，毫不动摇，坚定不移地贯彻林彪副主席的指示，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把我党我军的优良传统一代一代传下去，永不断线，永不失传！（附图片）
