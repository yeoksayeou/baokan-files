    Unify Thinking, Go Deep into the Masses
    Lüxi County is often in the midst of fighting natural disasters. Before the hail stops, floods arise, followed by drought and pests. In the face of this situation, what should the Party Committee of the county do? First, within the county committee, we studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Everyone engaged in fierce debate, finally raising our understanding and unifying our thinking. The county committee went deep into the grassroots, and the broad masses of cadres and people immediately launched a vigorous upsurge in the spring planting campaign. Taoxiao Commune was leading in all aspects of work, and the county committee promptly convened an on-site meeting in this commune. Cadres at all levels felt this deeply and, upon returning, revised their original plans, doubling the planting area.
    Lüxi County's water storage capacity accounts for one-third of the Honghe Autonomous Prefecture, but our county's water conservancy facilities rank last in the prefecture. We have only recently identified this gap. The county committee has acknowledged the backwardness and is determined to expand the paddy field area of ​​Lüxi from the current 96,000 mu to 200,000 mu within three to five years. This decision has already been implemented among the masses. Currently, a high tide of farmland capital construction centered on water, fertilizer, and soil has formed throughout the county.
    I deeply feel that a county committee must first revolutionize itself and establish lofty ambitions before it can lead the masses forward.

    统一思想　深入群众
    泸西县常处于同自然灾害搏斗之中，冰雹未落，洪灾又起，旱、虫相继而来。在这种情况面前，党的县委会怎么办？我们首先在县委内部学习《愚公移山》，大家开展激烈争论，终于提高了认识，统一了思想。县委深入基层，广大干部、群众立即掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的小春大生产高潮。桃笑公社各项工作领先，县委又及时在这个公社召开现场会，各级干部感受很深，回去都修改原订计划，种植面积成倍增加。
    泸西县蓄水量占红河自治州的三分之一，但是我们县的水利设施名列全州末位，最近我们才找到了这一差距。县委承认了落后，下定决心在三、五年内把泸西的水田面积，从现在的九万六千亩扩大到二十万亩。这项决定已经贯彻到群众中去，目前，一个以水、肥、土为中心的农田基本建设在全县已形成高潮。
    我深深感到，一个县委必须首先自己革命化，立下雄心壮志，才能领导群众前进。
