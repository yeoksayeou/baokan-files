Edition: 1

    The 1205 Team was originally the drilling team led by "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi and was one of the famous "Five-Good Banner Teams" (i.e., "Five-Good Model Teams") of Daqing Oilfield. In six years, they drilled 108 wells, totaling over 130,000 meters; cultivated and transferred 26 cadres and 52 technical workers to other teams, making significant contributions to the country.

    However, they also experienced a tortuous path.
    The First Three Years of the Campaign: Emphasize Politics, Continuous Leap Forward

    In 1960, at the very beginning of the campaign, difficulties and contradictions abounded. Captain "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi, responding to the Party's call, organized everyone to study "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they analyzed the difficulties, recognized the situation, identified the primary contradiction, and researched solutions. The workers said, "Imperialism and revisionism are trying to strangle us, wanting us to surrender our red flag. Absolutely not! We have many difficulties. But no matter how great these difficulties are, they are not as great as the country's shortage of oil. Of all the contradictions, the most important contradiction is whether we can secure the large oilfield as soon as possible!" People connected the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle with the campaign's situation. They fought for three days and three nights, carrying and lifting with their shoulders, to get the dozens of tons of drilling rig in place. Filled with the revolutionary fervor of throwing off the backward label of oil and winning glory for the country and serving the people, they broke the ice to fetch water, carrying dozens of tons of water with basins and buckets, and secured the first oil well.

    In 1961 and 1962, life was even more difficult, and the class struggle was more intense. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, continued to deeply conduct class education, and waged fierce struggles against various erroneous thoughts. At the same time, they learned from "Iron Man," established models, and continuously improved the political consciousness of the workers.

    On this basis, the 1205 Team achieved great success, produced products, cultivated talent, and accumulated experience, and was rated as a "Five-Good Banner Team" for three consecutive years.
    1963: Neglecting Politics, Losing the "Banner"

    People's understanding is not completed at once, and emphasizing politics also requires repeated implementation. In 1963, the national economic situation improved. After three years of hard struggle, the Daqing Oil Campaign achieved a great victory, and the scene was prosperous. However, the cadres of the 1205 Team (at that time, "Iron Man" had already been transferred from this team) mistakenly believed that "the acute class struggle situation has passed," and that class education and ideological work had been grasped for several years, laying a foundation, and that they should, and could, focus on production. They said, "A banner, a banner, must steam white buns for others to see. If the footage doesn't go up, it doesn't look like a banner." "The old banner has a solid foundation, with technology and experience, a little more effort, a little more urgency, and we can definitely make a name for ourselves." Only knowing to "work, work, work," they put hard tasks on the workers. As a result, production problems occurred one after another. Deputy Captain Wen Kunshan later recalled: "At that time, the cadres only wanted to 'carry the red flag' and drill more wells. They only cared about carrying their little red flag forward, and didn't even know that bourgeois ideology was attacking from the rear." One day, four people were watching the well in the team, and three of them left their posts to watch a movie. On February 3, an accident occurred, burning down six mobile prefab houses and causing great losses. Shortly after, the inclination of one well exceeded five degrees, rendering it useless, with a loss of 110,000 yuan. At this time, they had not yet awakened. With tears in their eyes, they looked for the reasons, but they found that it was "the derrick was skewed, the drill pipe was bent, the sand wasn't cleaned out, and the rollers weren't round enough."

    The fundamental problem was that the cadres and workers were burdened by the banner, fostering arrogance. After abandoning a well, some individuals still believed: "Even though there was an accident, we are still ranked at the top!" The oilfield leadership asked them to go to the 1203 Team to find the gaps. They returned and said: "Their equipment is not as well managed as ours, and their handling of single drill pipes is not as fast as ours!" They studied at the 1281 Team and said: "Their drill tools are the same as ours, and their operation is not as skillful as ours!" Before studying, the well inclination was 2.3 degrees. After "studying," the well inclination was 4.7 degrees. Even though the well was already inclined, they still wanted to set a record for daily footage.

    Under the leadership of the Party, they examined the leadership team, political work, production management, the banner burden, and other issues, and summarized their experiences and lessons. They truly realized that the key was failing to adhere to the "Four Firsts." Class struggle is effective when grasped, but it's not a one-time thing. Ideological work must be grasped every day, in everything. No matter how good the foundation, it will collapse if loosened. The Party branch cannot be without normal democratic life. Cadres cannot be arrogant and complacent. Arrogant soldiers will be defeated. Achievements can only explain the past and cannot guarantee the future. They studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, vigorously grasped class education, and reversed the situation in the second half of the year, drilling ten wells, all of which were qualified.
    The Last Two Years: Emphasizing Politics, Re-entering the Ranks of the Advanced

    In 1964, during the winter training, they used Chairman Mao's "two-point theory" to summarize the positive and negative experiences and lessons from the first four years of the campaign, improved their understanding, and were able to more consciously emphasize politics.

    In both 1964 and 1965, they concentrated for a period of time and conducted socialist education movements, and the workers received profound class education. Xu Wanming, a third-level scaffolder, was particularly energetic at the beginning of the campaign, and everyone called him "Little Tiger," but he changed in the second half of 1963. Once, he accidentally injured his finger at work, stayed in the hospital for a few days, and after being discharged, he was in low spirits and requested to be transferred to another shift or team, and even wanted to resign. Some people said that "Little Tiger" had turned into "Little Mouse." During the socialist education movement, he confessed: "I came from a poor peasant background, but I neglected ideological reform. Life got better, and my thoughts changed. I forgot my roots. My body was on the side of the proletariat, but my heart was leaning towards the bourgeoisie, and I was almost pulled over." Class education awakened him, and "Little Mouse" turned into "Little Tiger" again and was even promoted to driller. All twelve people in the team resolved issues such as fearing hardship and fatigue and not being content with their work. Their consciousness was generally improved, and the "Iron Man" spirit was greatly promoted. Revolution promoted production. In 1964, they drilled the first all-excellent quality model well in the entire oilfield. Throughout the year, they drilled twenty-one wells, all of which were all-excellent, re-entering the ranks of the advanced. In 1965, thirteen key members of the team were transferred out. With new people and new positions accounting for more than two-thirds, they were more consciously emphasizing politics and taking more steady steps. They drilled twenty wells, nineteen of which were all-excellent; all equipment was in good condition every month; safe production was achieved; and 100% attendance. They were once again rated as a "Five-Good Banner Team."

    During this period, what were their main experiences?

    Seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, put great effort into the word "use," and have cadres take the lead in studying and applying, transforming their thinking and guiding practice. Captain Zhou Zhengrong used Mao Zedong Thought to compare and examine the erroneous understanding that "doing a good job in production is the greatest politics." Captain Wang Zuofu used Chairman Mao's instruction that "modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind" to overcome his own arrogance and complacency. Instructor Ye Derong repeatedly studied "Methods of Work of Party Committees," leading the core members of the Party branch to earnestly overcome personal selfishness and distracting thoughts.

    In 1965, they sent 465 people to eleven brother units to learn from their experiences. They identified eighty-eight gaps, including those in emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and grasping living ideas, which further strengthened their consciousness of emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and putting great effort into the word "use." They summarized their experience and said: When there are achievements, study without being arrogant; when defeated, study without being discouraged; when things are going smoothly, study without being blindly optimistic; when encountering difficulties, study without being overwhelmed by difficulties. As long as you are engaged in revolution, you must read Chairman Mao's books. We will read them in this generation, and the next generation will read them. We must always regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions!

    Emphasize living ideological education, and vigorously grasp the ideological revolutionization of people. They used Mao Zedong Thought to do living ideological work, using the viewpoints of class and class struggle to understand the large number of ideological problems among workers, and regard the daily and large number of individual ideological work as continuous education to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.

    Zhang Xiuzhi was a high school graduate in 1958 and was transferred from Yumen to Daqing in 1961, but he was not content with his work. When told about ideological transformation, he said, "I have read twelve years of revolutionary books. A high school student becoming an oil worker means that my thinking is advanced enough. What is there to transform!" He was always out of sync with his comrades. After class education, Party group leader Yuan Yufu took the initiative to form a "one-help-one" pair with him, helping him study "Serve the People," caring for him in life, and praising him promptly for any progress. He gradually enlightened him to use the viewpoint of class struggle to analyze his own thoughts and improve his class consciousness. Later, in his diary, he summarized his two kinds of thoughts before and after: "In the past, I sighed when looking at the grassland, feeling that being a driller was really unpromising, and my future was even more problematic; now, I rejoice when looking at the grassland, feeling that being a driller is really amazing, and my future is bright and vast, and I will fight to the end for the revolution." With improved class consciousness, he was rated as a five-good red flag bearer in 1964, and in 1965, he was elected by the masses to serve as a driller. Although he had many difficulties in his work, he could straighten his back and take them on. He said, "To take over the driller's position, the first thing to do is to take over the position of Mao Zedong Thought." Using Mao Zedong Thought to command the brake handle, their class became an advanced class in the entire team.

    Vigorously grasp "well completion training" (i.e., promptly grasp training after drilling a well), and frequently use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, summarize experiences and lessons, repeatedly implement the "Four Firsts," and continuously improve the consciousness of emphasizing politics.

    In 1963, when "well completion training" began, many people were not conscious enough, and it was frequently impacted and even squeezed out. While chanting that training was good, they always thought that stopping work for a day was a great pity. After the spirit of the first political work conference of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry was conveyed in 1964, they were more conscious of "well completion training," but the time was still not guaranteed. During the training, there were more discussions about drilling speed, effectiveness, and measures, and less focus on grasping the "Four Firsts." In 1965, the atmosphere of emphasizing politics became increasingly strong, the ideological level of cadres was further improved, and they realized from practice that "well completion training" was an effective measure to emphasize politics and implement the "Four Firsts." Once grasped earnestly, it was not only feasible and achievable, but also had immediate results. This further enlightened their consciousness. In 1965, they drilled twenty wells and conducted twenty-five days of training, and the "Four Firsts" were further implemented.

    "Well completion training" has many benefits: First, it can be used to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way with problems in mind, and solve the tendency of minor issues using the method of small rectification. Second, it can be used to conduct free discussions on the problems that occurred in the previous well and promote the three major democracies. Third, it can be used to commend good people and good deeds, set examples, and promote comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. Fourth, it can be used to summarize experiences and lessons and make timely improvements in the next well. Fifth, it can be used to implement various systems of political work. Sixth, it can be used to continuously improve the level of cadres and team leaders through summary. Seventh, it can combine work and rest.

    The cadres of the 1205 Team said: The process from being unconscious to relatively conscious of "well completion training" is also the process of deepening understanding of emphasizing politics. Now that they have tasted the sweetness, they would rather squeeze production than squeeze training; summarize first, then deploy, and then inspect.
    Winter Training: New Understanding of Emphasizing Politics

    In the excellent situation of comprehensive development of work, they did not follow the old path of 1963. At the end of 1965, they again concentrated for nearly fifty days and vigorously grasped the winter training centered on class education and five-good comprehensive evaluation, greatly promoted the heroic image of "Iron Man," and universally and consciously looked for gaps in accordance with the requirements of high standards. Fifty-six percent of the people examined their various bourgeois thoughts and further established a revolutionary worldview that was not for money, not for fame, not afraid of hardship, and not afraid of death. The cadres summarized the experience of emphasizing politics over the years, enhanced their confidence in progress, and clarified the direction of progress.

    They realized that emphasizing politics is not a one-time thing and requires repeated implementation. Even in the situation where emphasizing politics was relatively conscious in 1965, there were still some minor twists and turns. The first fifteen wells were drilled "with their tails between their legs," both well and fast. The last five wells were drilled "with their tails up," and they almost had to correct the inclination. They stopped and trained for three days before overcoming it. Now, they further realize that only by unswervingly following the path of emphasizing politics can the team become tougher and redder and move forward bravely with the red flag held high; only by putting politics first and using politics to command everything can production technology be implemented effectively. Impacting politics will lead to defeat, twists, and even setbacks. They know: "On the road of emphasizing politics, we have only taken the first step of the Long March. To engage in revolution for a lifetime, we must read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, live on class struggle for a lifetime, and emphasize politics for a lifetime! Especially in the new situation where the whole country is being revolutionized, and in the face of the new tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, we still have large gaps compared with the People's Liberation Army and various units across the country. We must wholeheartedly learn from the People's Liberation Army, even more intensify our living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and unswervingly follow the road of emphasizing politics to the end."

    突出政治　百战百胜
    大庆油田一二○五钻井队的经验和教训
    一二○五队原来是“铁人”王进喜领导的钻井队，是大庆油田的著名“五好标杆队”（即“五好标兵队”）之一。他们六年来打井一百零八口，十三万多米；培养和为外队输送干部二十六名、技术工人五十二名，为国家做出了重大的贡献。
    但是，他们也走过曲折的道路。会战头三年：重视政治，连续跃进
    一九六○年，会战一上手，困难重重，矛盾很多。队长“铁人”王进喜响应党的号召，组织大家学习《矛盾论》《实践论》，按照毛主席的教导，分析困难，认清形势，找出主要矛盾，研究解决办法。工人说：“帝国主义、修正主义在卡我们的脖子，想让我们交出红旗。一万个不能。我们有许多困难。这些困难再大，也不如国家缺油的困难大。这矛盾，那矛盾，能不能早日拿下大油田，是最主要的矛盾！”人们把反帝、反修的斗争形势和会战形势联系起来认识；奋战三天三夜，肩扛人抬，让几十吨重的钻机就位。人们满怀甩掉石油落后帽子，为国争光，为民争气的革命怒潮，破冰取水，用脸盆、水桶端水几十吨，拿下了第一口油井。
    一九六一年、一九六二年，生活更艰苦，阶级斗争更激烈。他们反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，继续深入进行阶级教育，同各种错误思想进行激烈的斗争。同时，学“铁人”，树标兵，使职工的政治觉悟不断得到提高。
    在这个基础上，一二○五队取得了很大的成绩，出了产品，出了人材，也出了经验，连续三年被评为“五好标杆队”。一九六三年：忽视政治，丢了“标杆”
    人的认识不是一次完成的，突出政治同样要反复落实。一九六三年，全国经济形势好转。大庆石油会战，经过三年艰苦奋斗，取得了伟大的胜利，一片兴旺景象。但是，一二○五队的干部们（当时，“铁人”已经调离这个队），错误地认为：“尖锐的阶级斗争形势已经过去了”，阶级教育、思想工作连抓了几年，有了基础，应该、也可以抓抓生产了。他们说：“标杆，标杆，得蒸出白馒头来让人家看看，进尺上不去不象个标杆样子。”“老标杆，底子厚，有技术，有经验，加把劲，抓紧一点，一定能搞点名堂出来。”只知道“干，干，干”，给工人压硬任务，结果，生产接连出了问题。副队长闻昆山后来回忆说：“当时，干部一心只想‘扛红旗’，多打井，只顾自己扛着小红旗朝前跑，资产阶级思想抄了后路也不知道。”有一天，队上有四个人看井，其中，三个人竟擅离岗位去看电影。二月三日，发生事故，烧掉了六间活动板房，造成了很大损失。又不久，有一口井的井斜超过五度，报废了，损失十一万元。这时，他们还没有清醒过来，流着眼泪找原因，找的却是“井架偏，钻杆弯，砂子没捞净，滚筒不够圆”。
    根本问题是干部和职工背了标杆包袱，滋长了骄傲情绪。报废了一口井以后，个别人仍然认为：“别看出了事故，还是排在头里！”油田领导让他们到一二○三队去找差距，他们回来说：“他们的设备还不如我们管得好，接单根也不如我们快！”去一二八一队学习，说：“他们的钻具和我们一样，操作还不如我们利索！”未学之前，井斜二度三。“学”了之后，井斜四度七。井已经斜了，还想创日进尺纪录。
    在党的领导下，他们检查了领导班子、政治工作、生产管理、标杆包袱等等问题，总结了经验教训。他们真正认识到，关键是没有坚持四个第一，阶级斗争一抓就灵，但不是一抓就完，思想工作要天天抓、事事抓，再好的基础，一松就垮；党支部不能没有正常的民主生活，干部不能骄傲自满，骄兵必败，成绩只能说明过去，不能保证将来。他们大学毛主席著作，大抓狠抓阶级教育，下半年扭转了局面，打井十口，口口合格。最近两年：突出政治，重新跨入先进行列
    一九六四年，冬季整训，他们用毛主席的两分法，总结会战头四年一正一反的经验和教训，提高了认识，能够比较自觉地突出政治了。
    一九六四和一九六五年两年，都集中了一段时间，进行了社会主义教育运动，职工受到深刻的阶级教育。三级架工许万明，在会战开始时，干劲特别足，大家叫他“小老虎”，但到一九六三年下半年，他变了。有一次，他在工作时不小心伤了手指，住了几天医院，出院后情绪低落，提出调班调队的要求，甚至还想退职。有人说，“小老虎”变成了“小老鼠”。在社会主义教育运动中，他检讨说：“我出身贫农，但是忽视了思想改造，生活好了，思想变了，忘了本。变得身子在无产阶级这边，心却一个劲朝资产阶级那边靠拢，几乎被拉了过去。”阶级教育唤醒了他，“小老鼠”又变成了“小老虎”，还被提拔为司钻。全队十二个人，解决了怕苦怕累、不安心工作等问题，觉悟普遍提高，“铁人”精神大发扬。革命促生产。一九六四年，他们打出全油田第一口质量全优样板井。全年打井二十一口，口口全优，重新跨入先进行列。一九六五年，全队调出十三名骨干，在新人、新岗位占三分之二还多的情况下，突出政治更自觉，步子更稳，打了二十口井，其中十九口全优；设备台台月月完好；实现安全生产；百分之百出勤。再次被评为“五好标杆队”。
    在这期间，他们有什么主要经验呢？
    认真活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，干部带头学、带头用，改造思想，指导实践。队长周正荣用毛主席思想对照检查了“搞好生产就是最大的政治”的错误认识；队长王作福用毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的指示，克服了自己的骄傲自满情绪。指导员叶德荣反复学习《党委会的工作方法》，领导党支部骨干认真克服个人私心杂念。
    一九六五年，他们先后派出四百六十五人次，到十一个兄弟单位取经。找出了突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作、抓活思想等八十八条差距，进一步增强了突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”上狠下功夫的自觉性。他们总结经验说：有了成绩学，不骄傲；打了败仗学，不气馁；顺利时候学，不盲目乐观；遇到困难学，不被困难压倒。只要干革命就要读毛主席的书，我们这一代读，下一代读，永远要把主席的书当作最高指示！
    突出活的思想教育，狠抓人的思想革命化。他们用毛泽东思想作活的思想工作，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点来认识职工当中的大量思想问题，把日常的、大量的一人一事的思想工作看作是经常性的兴无灭资的教育。
    张秀志是一九五八年的高中毕业生，一九六一年由玉门调到大庆，不安心工作。给他讲思想改造，他说：“我念了十二年革命的书，一个高中生当石油工人，思想就够先进的了，有什么可以改造的呢！”他和同志们总是闹不到一块。经过阶级教育，党小组长苑玉福主动和他结“一帮一”对子，帮助他学习《为人民服务》，从生活上关心他，有点进步及时表扬，逐步启发他用阶级斗争的观点来分析自己的思想，提高了他的阶级觉悟。后来，他在日记里总结了自己前后两种思想：“过去是：望草原唉声叹气，当钻工真没出息，论前途更成问题；现在是：望草原欢天喜地，当钻工真了不起，论前途光明远大，为革命奋斗到底。”阶级觉悟提高了，一九六四年被评为五好红旗手，一九六五年又经群众选举，担任了司钻。虽然他在工作中有不少困难，但能挺直腰板挑起来。他说：“接好司钻的班首先要接好毛泽东思想的班。”用毛泽东思想指挥刹把，他们班成了全队的先进班。
    狠抓“完井整训”（即打完一口井后及时抓紧整训），经常以毛主席思想为指针，总结经验教训，反复落实四个第一，不断提高突出政治的自觉性。
    一九六三年，开始执行“完井整训”时候，许多人不够自觉，经常受到冲击，甚至被挤掉了。嘴里喊整训好，心里总想，停工一天，多可惜。一九六四年，石油工业部第一次政治工作会议精神传达以后，对“完井整训”比较自觉了，但时间仍然没有保证。整训时，也是讲钻速、时效、措施多，抓“四个第一”少。一九六五年，突出政治的空气越来越浓，干部思想进一步提高，从实践中认识到，“完井整训”是突出政治、落实四个第一的有效措施。认真一抓，不仅行得通、办得到，而且立竿见影。这又进一步启发了自觉性，一九六五年打井二十口，整训二十五天，四个第一进一步落实。
      “完井整训”有许多好处：一，可以带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，用小整风的办法解决倾向性的苗头；二，可以针对上一口井发生的问题开展自由讨论，发扬三大民主；三，可以表扬好人好事，树样板，推动比学赶帮超；四，可以总结经验教训，在下一口井及时改进；五，可以落实政治工作的各项制度；六，可以通过总结，不断提高干部和班组长水平；七，可以劳逸结合。
    一二○五队的干部说：对“完井整训”从不自觉到比较自觉的过程，也就是对突出政治的加深认识的过程。现在，尝到了甜头，宁挤生产，不挤整训；先总结，再布置，后检查。冬季整训：对突出政治又有了新的认识
    在工作全面发展的大好形势下，他们没走一九六三年的老路。一九六五年底，又以近五十天的时间，集中狠抓了以阶级教育、五好总评为中心的冬季整训，大树“铁人”英雄形象，普遍地自觉地按照高标准的要求找差距。百分之五十六的人检查了自己形形色色的资产阶级思想，进一步树立了不为钱、不为名、不怕苦、不怕死的革命世界观。干部总结了历年突出政治的经验，增强了前进的信心，明确了前进方向。
    他们认识到，突出政治不是一劳永逸的事，要反复落实。即使在一九六五年突出政治比较自觉的情况下，也是有些小曲折的。前十五口井“夹着尾巴打”，又好又快。后五口井“翘着尾巴”打，差一点纠斜，停下整训了三天才得到克服。现在，他们进一步认识到，只有坚定不移地走突出政治的路，队伍才能越打越硬，越打越红，才能高举红旗勇往直前；只有把政治放在首位，以政治统帅一切，生产技术才能落在实处。冲击了政治，就要打败仗，扭秧歌，甚至栽跟头。他们知道：“在突出政治的路上，我们仅仅是万里长征迈出了第一步。干一辈子革命必须读一辈子毛主席的书，吃一辈子阶级斗争饭，突出一辈子政治！特别是在全国都在革命化的新形势下，在第三个五年计划的新任务面前，我们和解放军比，和全国各单位比，还是大有差距。我们一定要全心全意向解放军学习，更加加紧活学活用毛主席著作，沿着突出政治的大道坚定不移地走到底。”
