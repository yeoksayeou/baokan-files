Edition: 6

	The Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House has printed small picture cards costing one fen each and some lower-priced fine arts publications. These fine arts publications have healthy content, diverse themes, and good printing quality. They are truly good and cheap, and are warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses.
	For fine arts publications to truly face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the broad masses, the staff of the fine arts publishing house must first have a red heart to serve the people, be able to think of the masses in everything, and proceed from the masses' immediate interests in everything. Not only should the published artworks be loved by the masses in content and form, but also the current economic level of the masses should be taken into consideration. Otherwise, no matter how exquisite and beautiful the fine arts publications are printed, if the cost is too high, the price is too expensive, and it is not in line with the purchasing power of the masses, they will still not be able to play their due educational role, and the masses will still not receive education. Didn't Comrade Mao Zedong teach us this way: "Anything must be able to bring real benefits to the people to be a good thing"?
	The staff of the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House have been educated in the torrent of the Great Cultural Revolution, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. With workers, peasants, and soldiers in their hearts, they have achieved results in their work. The desire to serve the people prompted them to make a firm decision: they must send more fine arts publications to the hands of the masses. They resolutely walked out of the editorial office, went deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, went to the masses to investigate and study, listened to the opinions of the masses, and understood the needs of the masses. With the help and inspiration of the masses, they correctly positioned the relationship between popularization and improvement, solved the contradictions that could not be solved in the past, boldly broke through the frameworks, improved their work, and produced one-fen small picture cards and other fine arts publications welcomed by the masses. They did a good thing for the masses. Their path is correct, and their approach is worth promoting.
	The emergence of one-fen small picture cards should not be simply regarded as a change in the price of fine arts publications, but should be seen as a change in people's thinking. And the change in thought is the result of their studying Chairman Mao's works, their living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, going deep into the masses, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, and earnestly improving their work. Only by truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we promote changes in work; only by having workers, peasants, and soldiers in our hearts can we serve workers, peasants, and soldiers well.

    不只是价格的变化
    上海人民美术出版社印制了一分钱一张的小画片和一些定价比较低廉的美术出版物。这类美术出版物，内容健康，题材多样，印刷质量也好，真正做到了物美价廉，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    美术出版物要真正面向工农兵，面向广大群众，首先要求美术出版社的工作人员有一颗为人民服务的红心，能够处处为群众着想，处处从群众切身利益出发，不但要使出版的美术作品在内容上、形式上为群众所喜爱，而且应该考虑到目前群众的经济水平。否则，美术出版物印制得再精美，再漂亮；但是，由于成本太高，价格太贵，和群众的购买力不相适应，还是不能发挥它们应有的教育作用，群众还是受不到教益。毛泽东同志不就这样教导过我们：“任何一种东西，必须能使人民群众得到真实的利益，才是好的东西”吗？
    上海人民美术出版社的工作人员们，正是在文化大革命的激流中受到了教育，认真学习了毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，心里有了工农兵，才把工作做出了成绩。为人民服务的愿望促使他们产生了决心：一定要把更多的美术出版物送到群众手里去。他们毅然走出编辑室，深入工农兵，到群众中去调查研究，听取群众意见，了解群众需要。在群众的帮助和启发之下，摆对了普及和提高的关系，解决了过去无法解决的矛盾，大胆地突破框框，改进工作，生产出为群众欢迎的一分钱的小画片等美术出版物来。他们为群众办了一件好事情。他们的路走得对头，他们的作法值得提倡。
    一分钱小画片的产生，不能单纯视为是美术出版物价格的变化，应该看到这是人的思想的变化。而思想上的变，又是他们学习毛主席著作的结果，是他们活学活用毛主席著作，深入群众，虚心听取群众意见，认真改进工作的结果。只有真正地掌握了毛泽东思想，才能促进工作上的变化；只有心里有了工农兵，才能为工农兵服务得好。
