    Always Look Forward
    Cui Qingshan, Worker-Engineer of Chongqing Qijiang Gear Factory
    Someone asked me, "Old Cui, the Third Five-Year Plan has begun, what are your plans?"
    I said, "Self-reliance, technological innovation, using limited manpower and material resources to make a greater contribution to the country."
    Why? Isn't the Third Five-Year Plan being implemented on the basis of unprecedentedly strong material and technological conditions in our country? Yes. But first of all, the new Five-Year Plan is a grand plan for developing the national economy. With a large plan, the needs in all aspects are also great, and our working class should shoulder this heavy burden, using less capital, equipment, raw materials, to produce more high-quality products for the country. Moreover, more importantly, self-reliance and building the country through diligence and thrift have always been our fundamental policy for carrying out socialist construction.
    Most of the workers in the factory share my view. But some people say that through technological innovation in the past few years, the potential has been almost fully tapped; especially the factory's equipment conditions are relatively backward, and it is impossible to surpass advanced enterprises with modern equipment in reducing raw material consumption. I said that although our equipment is currently not as good as some advanced units, as long as we listen to Chairman Mao, dare to revolutionize, dare to create, rely on the masses, and give play to everyone's wisdom and talent, we can create a more advanced level of production under relatively poor material and technical conditions.
    In this way, together with the workers in the factory, I started the activity of innovating technology again in the new year. All the forging heating furnaces in our factory were originally built according to a foreign blueprint, consuming a lot of coal, and the workers' working conditions were also not good. In the past, it was considered a "foreign furnace" and no one dared to touch it. This year, we broke this "foreign framework," learned from the experience of advanced units in improving smokeless heating furnaces, and boldly carried out reconstruction based on the specific conditions of our factory's products and furnace types. In just over ten days since the beginning of the year, five of the factory's ten heating furnaces have been successfully rebuilt. Preliminary calculations show that it saves 30% of coal; after all the reconstruction is completed in the first half of the year, it can save several thousand tons of coal every year. The workers' operating conditions have also been greatly improved.
    The "steering knuckle" of the Jiefang brand truck is a product that our factory produces in large quantities. Earlier, each product consumed a little more than one kilogram of steel than the Changchun Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which meant that more than 30 tons of valuable alloy steel were consumed every year. Last year, after we successfully innovated the new process of sealed molds, the steel consumption per product was 1.2 kilograms less than that of the Changchun factory, becoming the enterprise with the lowest material consumption among enterprises producing similar products nationwide.
    Can this achievement be improved further this year? We studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and realized that production technology is constantly developing. We must never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and we must constantly summarize and innovate in practice. So, I worked with the workers to work hard and study together to further improve the die and forging process. As a result, in the first eighteen days of the first month of this year, the material weight of each "steering knuckle" was reduced by 0.2 kilograms. Although the amount saved is not very large, it has given us a good inspiration: as long as people's eyes look forward and not backward, and do not regard the existing achievements as a burden but as a new starting point, production technology can continue to develop.

    永远向前看
    重庆綦江齿轮厂工人工程师  崔庆山
    有人问我：“老崔，第三个五年计划开始了，你打算怎么办？”
    我说：“自力更生，革新技术，用有限的人力物力，为国家作出更大的贡献来。”
    为什么呢？第三个五年计划不是在我国物质技术条件空前雄厚的基础上开始执行的吗？是的。但首先，新的五年计划是一个发展国民经济的大计划。计划大，各方面的需要也多，我们工人阶级就应当挑起这副重担子，用更少的资金、设备、原料、材料，为国家生产更多的优质产品。而且，更重要的是，自力更生，勤俭建国，始终是我们进行社会主义建设的根本方针。
    厂里的大多数职工都和我有同样的看法。但也有人说，前几年我们通过技术革新，潜力已挖得差不多了；特别是厂里的设备条件比较落后，在降低原材料消耗方面不可能超过拥有现代化设备的先进企业。我说，虽然我们的设备目前还不如一些先进单位，但只要我们听毛主席的话，敢于革命，敢于创造，依靠群众，发挥每个人的聪明才智，就可以在物质技术条件比较差的情况下，创造出比较先进的生产水平。
    就这样，我同厂里的职工们一道，在新的一年里，又开始了革新技术的活动。我们厂所有的锻造加热炉，原来都是照搬一个外国的图样修造的，耗煤多，工人劳动条件也不好。过去，认为是“洋炉子”，不敢动。今年，我们打破了这个“洋框框”，学习了先进单位改进无烟加热炉的经验，并结合我厂产品和炉型的具体条件，大胆进行改建。在开年来的短短十几天中，全厂十座加热炉就改建成功了五座，初步计算，就节约煤炭百分之三十；上半年全部改建完成后，每年可节约煤炭几千吨。工人的操作条件也大大改善。
    解放牌汽车的“转向节”，是我厂大量生产的一种产品。早先，每件产品耗用的钢材要比长春汽车制造厂多一点一公斤，这样，每年就要多消耗贵重的合金钢材三十多吨。去年我们革新成功密封式模具新工艺后，每件产品耗用的钢材比长春厂还少了一点二公斤，成为全国生产同类产品企业中耗料最少的企业。
    今年，这个成绩还能不能再提高一步呢？我们学习了毛主席的有关教导，认识到生产技术总是不断发展的，决不能满足于已经取得的成绩，必须在实践中不断总结，不断革新。于是，我又和工人们一起，鼓足劲头共同研究，进一步改进胎模和锻造工艺，结果，在今年第一个月的前十八天中，又将每件“转向节”的用料重量降低了零点二公斤。虽然节约的数量不算很大，但却给了我们一个很好的启示：只要人的眼光向前看，不向后看，不把已有的成绩当作包袱而当作新的起点，生产技术就能不断发展。
