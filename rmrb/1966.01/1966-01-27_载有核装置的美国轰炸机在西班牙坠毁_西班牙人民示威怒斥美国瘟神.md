    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Madrid on the 26th: Because a U.S. B-52 bomber carrying nuclear devices crashed near the small town of Palomares on the southeastern coast of Spain on the 17th, the residents of this town cannot drink the local milk or eat the local vegetables and eggs, as these foods may be contaminated with radioactive materials. The residents of Palomares now have to rely on food brought in from elsewhere.
    The fact that U.S. planes carrying nuclear devices are running rampant everywhere has aroused angry protests from the Spanish people. Residents of the city of Cuevas del Almanzora held a demonstration on the 21st, chanting: "Down with the Americans! We don't want their bombs!" One citizen said angrily, "This has always been a peaceful area. Not even the bombs from our own civil war have ever exploded here, but now this kind of bomb has exploded."
    After the U.S. plane carrying nuclear devices crashed, the U.S. authorities were thrown into a panic, sending hundreds of U.S. soldiers as well as a large number of helicopters, ships, and divers to search for the missing nuclear devices everywhere.
    U.S. Air Forces in Europe Commander General Holloway made a special trip from West Germany to Madrid on the 23rd to discuss the incident with the U.S. Ambassador to Spain and the head of the military mission.
    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Algiers on the 24th: The Delegation of the Third Spanish Republic to Africa and the Middle East issued a communiqué in Algiers on the 24th, exposing the fact that U.S. imperialism has stored many atomic bombs in Spain. The communiqué pointed out that this is a real threat to the lives of the Spanish people and the people of Spain's neighboring countries.
    The communiqué also demanded the dismantling of the U.S. military aggression bases established on Spanish territory and called on the people of all countries to support the Spanish people's struggle for sovereignty, freedom, and the right to survival.
    The communiqué was issued in connection with the collision between a U.S. B-52 bomber carrying nuclear devices and a U.S. KC-135 jet tanker over the southeastern coast of Spain on the 17th. It is reported that after this collision, the U.S. authorities dispatched a large number of airplanes, helicopters, and a minesweeper to search for the missing nuclear devices.
    In order to cover up its aggressive purpose of storing nuclear weapons all over the world, the U.S. military authorities desperately publicized that the B-52 bomber that crashed was carrying nuclear weapons "without detonating devices." The U.S. also instructed the Spanish authorities not to allow newspapers to publish the news that the U.S. bomber was carrying nuclear weapons, in an attempt to escape the condemnation and protests of Spanish public opinion. But according to a United Press International report on the 23rd, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force authorities in Spain admitted that a special decontamination team has been dispatched from Madrid, the Spanish capital, to the area near the scene of the incident to conduct radioactivity checks on residents.

    载有核装置的美国轰炸机在西班牙坠毁
    西班牙人民示威怒斥美国瘟神
    据新华社二十六日讯　马德里消息：由于一架载有核装置的美国B—52型轰炸机十七日在西班牙东南沿海的小城镇帕洛马雷斯附近坠毁，这个城镇的居民不能喝当地的牛奶和吃当地的蔬菜和鸡蛋，因为这些食物有可能受到放射性物质的污染。帕洛马雷斯的居民现在不得不依靠从外地运来的食品。
    载有核装置的美国飞机到处乱闯，引起了西班牙人民的愤怒抗议。奎瓦斯德阿尔曼托拉市的居民在二十一日举行了示威游行，他们高呼：“打倒美国佬！不要他们的炸弹！”一位市民愤怒地说：“这里一向是个和平地区。甚至连我们国内战争的炸弹从来没有在这里爆炸过，现在这种炸弹却爆炸了。”
    在载有核装置的美国飞机坠毁后，美国当局手忙脚乱，派出了几百名美国兵以及大批的直升飞机和舰只和潜水员四出寻找坠落的核装置。
    美国驻欧洲空军总司令哈洛威二十三日专程从西德赶往马德里，就这一事件同美国驻西班牙大使和军事使团团长商谈。
    据新华社阿尔及尔二十四日电　西班牙第三共和国驻非洲和中东代表团二十四日在阿尔及尔发表一项公报，揭露美帝国主义在西班牙贮存许多原子弹。公报指出，这是对西班牙人民以及西班牙邻国人民生命安危的真正威胁。
    公报还要求拆除美国设在西班牙领土上的军事侵略基地，并且呼吁世界各国人民支持西班牙人民争取主权、自由和生存权利的斗争。
    这项公报是就一架载有核装置的美国B—52型轰炸机同另一架美国KC—135型喷气式加油机十七日在西班牙东南沿海的上空发生相撞事件而发表的。据报道，这一相撞事件发生后，美国当局出动大批飞机、直升飞机和一艘扫雷艇在搜索丢失的核装置。
    美国军事当局为了掩盖它在世界各地贮存核武器的侵略目的，拼命宣传遭坠毁的那架B—52型轰炸机上载着“没有引爆装置”的核武器。美国还指示西班牙当局不准报纸发表这架美国轰炸机携带着核武器的消息，企图逃避西班牙公众舆论的谴责和抗议。但据合众国际社二十三日报道，美国驻西班牙的空军当局的一个发言人承认，一个消除污染的特派专家队已从西班牙首都马德里派到出事地点附近地区对居民进行放射性现象的检查。
