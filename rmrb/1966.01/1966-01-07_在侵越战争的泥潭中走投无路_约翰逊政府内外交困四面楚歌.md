    Comrade Mao Zedong, when discussing the essence of American imperialism as being strong in appearance but feeble in reality, once said: “Its strength is only superficial and temporary. The various irreconcilable contradictions at home and abroad are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano.”
    Trapped and Desperate in the Quagmire of the Vietnam War
    The Johnson Administration Besieged at Home and Abroad
    The disastrous defeat of the Johnson government’s war of aggression against Vietnam fully exposes the weakness of American imperialism as being strong in appearance but feeble in reality, plunging it into unprecedented difficulties and isolation at home and abroad.
    Many bourgeois newspapers and periodicals in the United States, in reviewing the past year and looking ahead to the new year, have revealed anxious and uneasy feelings, worried that the war of aggression against Vietnam will lead the United States to greater failures and disasters. The New York Times' New Year's editorial admitted that "for the United States, this year will be the year of the Vietnam problem... the United States is falling into an unknown abyss... possibly getting deeper and deeper into the (Vietnamese) quagmire."
      War Escalates, Failures Deepen
    1965 was a year in which the Johnson government frantically expanded its aggression against Vietnam and suffered heavy defeats. Shortly after being re-elected as President of the United States, Johnson, along with his "electronic brain" brain trust, racked their brains to study countermeasures to save the United States from defeat in South Vietnam. Last year, they threw out various "magic weapons," including the "gradual escalation strategy," the "attack the South, bomb the North" operational plan, "the latest weapons," the conspiracy of "internationalizing the war," and the "peace talks" hoax, etc. However, the facts of the past year have shown that, under the resolute blows of the people of South and North Vietnam and the firm opposition of the people of the world, these "magic weapons" of the Johnson government have failed one by one.
    What pains the United States the most is that the South Vietnamese people are fighting stronger and winning more victories. The "special warfare" strategy, which is one of the basic components of Kennedy-Johnson's so-called "flexible response" strategy, has been completely bankrupt on the South Vietnamese battlefield. American commentator Lippmann pointed out that the "special warfare" fought by the United States with money, guns, and advisors has become a "war fought by the American government using American troops and assisted by the remnants of the Saigon forces." The inventor of "special warfare," former U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam Taylor, had to "resign" in July last year and roll out of South Vietnam with his tail between his legs, which is an important sign of the complete failure of "special warfare."
    On the basis of the failure of "special warfare," the United States brazenly "escalated" the war, implementing the so-called "attack the South, bomb the North," that is, constantly bombing North Vietnam and sending hundreds of thousands of American soldiers to directly participate in the war in South Vietnam. However, in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, the so-called "air and sea superiority" of the United States has also been declared a failure. According to reports, about 60 percent of the American planes bombing North Vietnam have been damaged to varying degrees, with a loss rate more than twice that of the Korean War. In South Vietnam, the heroic fighting of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces has also caused the American invading troops to suffer increasingly heavy casualties and defeats. The facts of the past year clearly show that no matter what troops, weapons, strategies, or tactics American imperialism uses in the war of aggression against Vietnam, it cannot save its defeat. The New York Times admitted that despite the fact that Johnson invested "more and more American combat troops in South Vietnam, after nine months of fighting, the United States is still on the defensive." "Compared to when Johnson further increased troops in South Vietnam in July last year, the enemy is not weaker but stronger."
      Insufficient Troops, Difficult Supply
    The repeated failures of the war of aggression against Vietnam have increasingly clearly exposed many fundamental weaknesses of American imperialism, which is struggling beyond its capabilities.
    First of all, there are insufficient troops. In the past year, the Johnson government robbed Peter to pay Paul, transferring troops from the American mainland, Western Europe, and other areas to increase the total number of American troops in Vietnam from 30,000 to more than 180,000. However, many American newspapers and periodicals have had to admit that even so, it is still far from enough to reverse the defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam. U.S. Newsweek recently admitted that even if the U.S. forces in South Vietnam increased several times, South Vietnam still has "not a single square mile that is truly pacified." Famous commentator Lippmann once estimated that the United States would need to invest even a million troops to stay in South Vietnam without being driven out.
    In order to make up for the shortage of troops and intensify the war of aggression, the Johnson government, on the one hand, pieced things together to continue to increase troops in South Vietnam, and on the other hand, expanded the scope of conscription and lowered conscription conditions at home. Recently, it has decided to conduct a "nationwide review" of young people who were originally considered "ineligible for enlistment" in order to draft them into the army. According to United Press International, under the new regulations, virtually all high school graduates will be drafted.
    At the same time, the problem of logistical supply is becoming an increasingly serious difficulty for American imperialism. U.S. News & World Report admitted that this has become "the biggest problem hindering combat operations in this war."
    In order to invade Vietnam, in addition to providing logistical support from nearby Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, Thailand, and other places, most of the military supplies have to be transported from the American mainland, more than 10,000 kilometers away. Due to the "gradual escalation" of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, the consumption of military supplies has increased dramatically, and even if the U.S. authorities transfer ships from the reserve fleet and Western Europe and charter many ships from foreign countries, it is far from solving the problem of ship shortages. At the same time, due to the insufficient capacity, equipment, and warehouses of South Vietnamese ports, even the existing transport ships cannot unload goods in South Vietnam in a timely manner, causing the military supply of the American invading troops to be disconnected. Famous American military commentator Baldwin admitted that it is "impossible for the United States to greatly increase combat troops in Vietnam until the difficulties in logistics are resolved."
      Heavy Burden, Weak Economy
    Moreover, with the "gradual escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the weakness of American finance and economy has become increasingly obvious.
    U.S. military spending for the aggression against Vietnam has soared from an average of $2-3 million per day at the beginning of last year to an average of $25 million per day now, and it continues to increase. This has made the already deficit-ridden and financially strapped U.S. budget even more precarious. The Washington Post admitted that the war of aggression against Vietnam "is becoming an increasingly heavy cost and burden (for the United States)."
    Due to the sharp increase in military spending for the aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. federal budget deficit for the current fiscal year has reached 8.5 billion to 10.5 billion U.S. dollars, which is one to two times higher than the originally estimated deficit of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, creating the largest deficit since the U.S. fiscal year 1959. The budget expenditure for the next fiscal year, according to White House press secretary Moyers, will reach the astronomical figure of 110 billion to 115 billion U.S. dollars. In order to cope with the increase in expenditure and make up for the deficit, the Johnson government has had to resort to issuing more currency and borrowing more public debt, which has further deteriorated U.S. inflation. In the first ten months of last year, the total amount of U.S. dollars circulating in the market increased by about 4 billion U.S. dollars. At the same time, U.S. corporate debt has also exceeded the 1.3 trillion U.S. dollar mark.
    The continuous deterioration of the domestic financial situation has further weakened the hegemonic position of the United States in the capitalist world economy. Due to the sharp increase in military spending for the aggression against Vietnam, which has led to increased overseas spending, the U.S. international payment deficit reached more than 1 billion U.S. dollars last year. This has further weakened the position of the U.S. dollar. In the past year, Western European countries have converted U.S. dollars into gold, causing the United States to lose more than 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of gold. Now the U.S. gold reserves have dropped to only more than 13.7 billion U.S. dollars, only about half of the gold debts that foreigners can demand to be exchanged at any time. This shows that the position of the U.S. dollar is even more precarious.
      People Oppose the War, Storms Rise
    Johnson's policy of aggression against Vietnam has been met with increasingly widespread and strong opposition from the American people. Last year, the American people launched an unprecedentedly vast, profound, and lasting movement against the U.S. government's aggression against Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands of people in dozens of states and nearly a hundred cities across the country participated in demonstrations and marches against the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam. In particular, on November 27 last year, tens of thousands of people from all over the United States held a massive protest march in Washington, which greatly shocked and struck the Johnson government. In addition, the masses in various places have adopted various forms of struggle, such as holding "extra-curricular lecture meetings," "tracking" demonstrations, hunger strikes, blocking troop transport trains, writing protest letters, posting anti-war advertisements in newspapers, etc. Several citizens have also used "self-immolation" to express their strong protest against the U.S. government's policy of aggression against Vietnam. The youth's struggle against conscription has become a central part of the anti-war movement. Many young people, regardless of the persecution of the authorities, publicly burn their draft cards, preferring to go to jail rather than go to South Vietnam to die for the war of aggression. A nationwide anti-conscription movement is being actively brewing. U.S. News & World Report, the mouthpiece of the U.S. ruling group, had to admit that the raging anti-war movement of the American people is like a "time bomb" buried in the American mainland.
    What is particularly alarming to the U.S. ruling group is that the two major trends of struggle of the American people – the anti-war movement and the struggle of the broad masses of black people for freedom and their own rights – have begun to converge. Demonstrations in many cities have shown that more and more black people have further politically linked the struggle against U.S. aggression against Vietnam with the struggle against domestic racial oppression in the United States, and have actively joined the ranks of protests and demonstrations.
      Anti-American Tide Sweeps Across Continents
    Around the world, the Johnson government has also become the target of public criticism. On February 7 last year, the Johnson government's brazen crime of expanding the war of aggression to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam aroused the angry condemnation of the people of the world. According to statistics, in just ten days after February 7, governments or publics in more than 60 countries condemned the U.S. aggression in various ways. In China, more than 10 million people held massive demonstrations to strongly protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and expressed their firm support for the Vietnamese people's anti-aggression struggle.
    Over the past year, people in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, such as Laos, Pakistan, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), Uruguay, and Venezuela, have also taken action to oppose the Johnson government's expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. Tens of thousands of people have continuously held protest rallies or taken to the streets in angry demonstrations.
    In many places, demonstrators not only burned the American flag and effigies of Johnson, but also attacked and destroyed the American embassy or the American Information Service, demonstrating their strong hatred for the American imperialist aggressors and their warm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.
    In addition, in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, the people of various countries, in response to and in support of the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam, also held grand demonstrations and marches in October and November last year to denounce the crimes of the Johnson government.
    The mass movement of people from all over the world to support the people of North and South Vietnam has formed a powerful anti-American tide, heavily surrounding the Johnson government and plunging it into an unprecedentedly isolated situation. U.S. Newsweek uneasily admitted that around the world, "the public's impression of the United States has indeed deteriorated greatly," and in many places, "a wave of demonstrations against U.S. policy has erupted." The magazine called this phenomenon "Johnson's Bay of Pigs."
      Pulling People into the Water, Bumping into Walls
    The U.S. government is also trapped in unprecedented isolation within the Western alliance. In order to escape the predicament in South Vietnam and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the United States has constantly asked its allies and puppet states to provide cannon fodder and other support for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. It has successively exerted pressure and pulled people into the water at meetings of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Alliance. Recently, U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey called on "non-communist countries to provide greater contributions to South Vietnam." However, over the past year, the United States has not received much support, except for South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand providing some cannon fodder. The recent attitude of Western European countries still shows that they are unwilling to fish chestnuts out of the fire for the United States and have poured cold water on the United States' new call.
    French President de Gaulle, in his New Year's broadcast address, reiterated France's unwillingness "to be dragged into a war that is not ours." The Associated Press said: People from all walks of life in France "strongly hope not only not to participate, but also to take some action to oppose this policy."
    Although the British government supports the U.S. government, due to opposition from the people and the left-wing forces within the Labor Party, and is also overwhelmed in suppressing colonial liberation movements, "British support is entirely diplomatic and does not provide other direct assistance." (Associated Press)
    Although West Germany supports U.S. aggression, it has also shown indifference and vigilance to the request for military assistance. All parties in West Germany oppose West Germany sending troops to South Vietnam. Basel, chairman of the parliamentary group of the ruling Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union, emphasized on the 3rd that "military obligations outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are not our business."
    Associated Press reporters stationed in West European capitals recently conducted a survey on this issue. The survey results show that "as far as most Europeans are concerned, the Americans in Vietnam mainly have to rely on their own efforts."
      Contradictions Upon Contradictions, Deserted by All
    Due to repeated failures in the war of aggression against Vietnam, being trapped and desperate, and facing numerous difficulties at home and abroad, the U.S. ruling group is also full of contradictions and disputes. Within the United States, there has been endless debate on the Vietnam issue throughout the past year, and Johnson has been attacked from all sides. For example, the Republican Party's leadership structure, the Republican Policy Coordinating Committee, issued a statement on December 13 publicly accusing Johnson of "poor leadership." The Republican Party has also published a white paper accusing the Democratic government of being responsible for the "crisis" caused by the war of aggression against Vietnam. Within the Democratic Party, more and more senators, including Morse, Gruening, Church, McGovern, and even Fulbright, Mansfield, and Robert Kennedy, have expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson's policies to varying degrees and expressed concern about the dangerous consequences of the U.S. government's continuous expansion of the war. According to U.S. newspapers, almost half of the senators in Congress are skeptical of Johnson's expansion of the war. Within the government, although Johnson is trying to maintain superficial "unity," the differences between the factions on the tactical issue of how to save the U.S. defeat are becoming increasingly fierce. In the words of the U.S. newspapers, "The Vietnam War has come to Washington!"
    Johnson's tragic situation of being trapped and desperate, surrounded by enemies on all sides, is something that no other president in the United States has ever encountered. (Attached picture)

### 在侵越战争的泥潭中走投无路  约翰逊政府内外交困四面楚歌

1966-01-07
第4版()
专栏：

    毛泽东同志谈到美国帝国主义外强中干的实质时，曾经说过：“它的强大，只是表面的和暂时的。国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    在侵越战争的泥潭中走投无路
    约翰逊政府内外交困四面楚歌
    约翰逊政府侵略越南战争的惨败，充分暴露了美帝国主义外强中干的虚弱性，使它在国内外陷入了空前困难和孤立的处境。
    美国许多资产阶级报刊在回顾过去一年和展望新的一年时，都流露出了忧虑不安的心情，担心侵越战争将把美国引向更大的失败和灾难。《纽约时报》的新年社论承认，“对美国来说，今年将是越南问题年，……美国正堕入未知的深渊之中，……可能在（越南的）泥沼里越陷越深”。
      战争扩大失败加深
    一九六五年是约翰逊政府疯狂扩大侵略越南和遭到沉重失败的一年。约翰逊在重新当选美国总统后不久，为了挽回美国在南越的败局，同他的“电子脑”智囊团绞尽脑汁研究对策，在去年抛出了种种“法宝”，其中包括“逐步升级战略”，“南攻北炸”的作战方案，“最新式的武器”，“战争国际化”的阴谋以及
  “和谈”骗局等等。但是，一年来的事实说明，在越南南方和北方人民的坚决打击下，在全世界人民的坚决反对下，约翰逊政府的这些“法宝”都已一一失灵了。
    最使美国痛心的是，南越人民越战越强，越战越胜，作为肯尼迪—约翰逊所谓“灵活反应”战略的基本组成部分之一的“特种战争”战略，已经在南越战场上彻底破产。美国评论员李普曼指出，美国出钱、出枪、出顾问来打的“特种战争”，已经变成了一场“由美国政府使用美国军队来打而由西贡部队的残余来辅助的战争”。“特种战争”的发明人、前美国驻南越“大使”泰勒不得不在去年七月间“辞职”，夹着尾巴滚出南越，就是“特种战争”彻底失败的重要标志。
    在“特种战争”失败的基础上，美国悍然把战争“升级”，实行所谓“南攻北炸”，即不断轰炸越南北方并派十几万美国兵在越南南方直接参战。但是，在英雄的越南人民面前，美国的所谓“海空优势”也已宣告失灵。据报道，美国轰炸越南北方的飞机，已有百分之六十左右遭到不同程度的损伤，损失比率比朝鲜战争高一倍以上。而在越南南方，南越人民武装的英勇战斗，也使美国侵略军队遭到越来越惨重的伤亡和失败。一年来的事实清楚地说明，美帝国主义无论在侵略越南的战争中使用什么军队，什么武器，什么战略，什么战术，都挽救不了它的败局。《纽约时报》承认，尽管约翰逊投入南越的“美国战斗部队越来越多，但是经过九个月的战斗，美国仍然处于防御地位”。“同去年七月约翰逊进一步大举增兵南越时比较，敌人不是更弱而是更强了”。
      兵力不足　供应困难
    侵越战争的连遭失败，已越来越明显地暴露了美帝国主义力不从心的许多根本弱点。
    首先是兵力不足。去年一年内，约翰逊政府拆东墙，补西墙，从美国本土、西欧和其他各方面调兵遣将，才把侵越美军总数从三万人增加到十八万多人。但是许多美国报刊不得不承认，即使如此，也仍然远远不足以扭转侵越战争的败局。美国《新闻周刊》不久以前承认，即使美国在南越的兵力增加了几倍，南越仍然是“没有一平方英里的地方是真正平定了的。”著名评论员李普曼曾经估计，美国要想呆在南越不被赶走，甚至要投入一百万兵力才行。
    为了弥补兵力不足，加紧扩大侵略战争，约翰逊政府一方面东拼西凑，继续增兵南越，另一方面又在国内扩大征兵范围，降低征兵条件。最近它已决定对原来认为“不合入伍条件”的青年进行“全国范围的复查”，以便把他们征召入伍。据合众国际社报道，按照新的规定，实际上所有中学毕业生都将被拉去当兵。
    与此同时，后勤供应问题也正在成为美帝国主义日益严重的困难。《美国新闻与世界报道》承认，这已成了美国“在这场战争中妨碍战斗行动的最大难题。”
    美国为了侵略越南，除了从附近的日本、冲绳、菲律宾、泰国等地提供后勤支援之外，绝大部分军火物资是要从一万多公里之外的美国本土运去的。由于美国侵越战争“逐步升级”，军火物资消耗越来越大，即使美国当局从后备役舰队和西欧抽调，从外国包租许多船只，也远远解决不了船只缺乏的问题。同时，由于南越的港口容量、设备和仓库不足，即使现有的运输船只也不能在南越及时卸货，使侵越美军的军火供应脱节。美国著名军事评论员鲍德温承认，美国“在后勤方面的困难解决以前，想在越南大量增加战斗部队是不可能的”。
      负担沉重　经济虚弱
    不仅如此，随着侵越战争的“逐步升级”，美国财政和经济的虚弱性也越加明显地暴露出来。
    美国侵略越南的军事开支，已由去年初的每天平均二、三百万美元猛增到现在的每天平均二千五百万美元，而且还在继续不断增加。这就使得原来就已经赤字累累、捉襟见肘的美国财政预算，更加陷入窘困不堪的境地。《华盛顿邮报》承认，侵越战争“正在成为（美国）越来越沉重的代价和负担”。
    由于侵越军费猛增，美国本财政年度的联邦预算赤字，达到八十五亿到一百零五亿美元，比原来估计的赤字三十五亿美元要高一到二倍，造成了美国一九五九财政年度以来的最大亏空。而下年度的预算开支，据白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯透露，将达到一千一百亿到一千一百五十亿美元的天文数字。为了应付开支增加和弥补赤字，约翰逊政府不得不乞灵于增发通货和增借公债，这就使美国通货膨胀进一步恶化。在去年头十个月内，美国市面上流通的美钞总额增加了约四十亿美元。同时，美国公司债务也已突破一万三千亿美元大关。
    国内财政金融状况的不断恶化，进一步削弱了美国在资本主义世界经济中的霸权地位。由于侵越军费激增而使海外开支扩大，美国去年国际支付逆差达十多亿美元。这又进一步削弱了美元的地位。过去一年来，西欧各国纷纷把美元兑换成黄金，使美国流失了十六亿多美元的黄金。现在美国的黄金储备已降到只剩一百三十七亿多美元，只及外国人可以随时要求兑换的黄金债务的一半左右。这说明美元的地位已经更加岌岌可危了。
      人民反战　风起云涌
    约翰逊的侵越政策遭到了美国人民越来越广泛和强烈的反对。美国人民去年掀起了空前浩大、空前深入和空前持久的反对美国政府侵略越南的运动。全国有数十个州近百个城市的数十万群众先后参加了反对约翰逊政府侵越战争的示威游行。特别是在去年十一月二十七日，来自美国各地的数万公众在华盛顿举行了声势浩大的抗议进军，使约翰逊政府受到极大的震动和打击。此外，各地群众还采取了各种各样的斗争方式，例如举行“课余宣讲会”、“跟踪”示威、绝食抗议、拦阻运兵火车、写抗议信、在报上登反战广告等等，好几个公民还用“自焚”来表示对美国政府侵越战争政策的强烈抗议。青年的反征兵斗争，已成为反战运动的一个中心内容。许多青年不顾当局的迫害，当众烧毁征兵证，宁愿坐牢也不愿去南越为侵略战争送死。一个全国性的反征兵运动，正在积极酝酿中。美国统治集团的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》不得不承认，美国人民如火如荼的反战运动好比埋在美国本土的一颗
  “定时炸弹”。
    特别使美国统治集团惊慌不安的是，美国人民的两大斗争潮流——反战运动和美国广大黑人争取自由和自身权利的斗争，开始汇合在一起。许多城市的示威表明，越来越多的黑人已经进一步从政治上把反对美国侵略越南的斗争同反对美国国内种族压迫的斗争联系起来，积极投入抗议示威的行列。
      反美怒潮　席卷各洲
    在世界各地，约翰逊政府也成了众矢之的。去年二月七日，约翰逊政府悍然把侵略战火扩大到越南民主共和国的罪行，激起了全世界人民的愤怒谴责。据统计，仅仅从二月七日后的十天时间里，就有六十多个国家的政府或公众用各种方式声讨美国侵略罪行。我国有一千多万人举行了声势浩大的示威游行，强烈抗议美帝国主义侵犯越南，并表示坚决声援越南人民的反侵略斗争。
    一年来，在老挝、巴基斯坦、马里、刚果（布）、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉等许多亚非拉国家人民，也行动起来，反对约翰逊政府扩大侵略越南战争，成千成万的人民群众曾经不断地举行抗议集会，或走上街头，愤怒示威。
    在许多地方，示威群众不但焚烧美国国旗和约翰逊的模拟人象，而且袭击和捣毁了美国大使馆或美国新闻处，表现了对美帝国主义侵略者的强烈仇恨和对越南人民正义斗争的热烈支持。
    此外，在西欧，在澳大利亚和新西兰，各国人民为了响应和支持美国人民反对侵越战争运动，也在去年十月、十一月间先后举行盛大的示威游行，声讨约翰逊政府的罪行。
    全世界各国人民声援越南北方和南方人民的群众运动，形成了一股强大的反美怒潮，使约翰逊政府受到重重的包围，陷于空前孤立的处境。美国《新闻周刊》不安地承认，在世界各地，“老百姓对美国的印象确实是大大变坏了”，许多地方“爆发了反对美国政策的示威游行浪潮”。这家杂志把这种现象称为
  “约翰逊的猪湾事件”。
      拉人下水　遭到碰壁
    美国政府在西方联盟中也陷于空前孤立。为了摆脱在南越的困境和扩大侵越战争，美国不断要其盟国和仆从国家为美国侵越战争提供炮灰和其他支援。它曾先后在东南亚条约组织和北大西洋联盟的会议上，施加压力，拉人下水。最近美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基又呼吁“非共产党国家对南越提供更大的贡献”。但是，一年来，除了南朝鲜、澳大利亚和新西兰提供了一些炮灰以外，美国并没有得到什么支援。最近西欧国家的态度仍然表明，它们不愿为美国火中取栗，对美国的新呼吁泼了冷水。
    法国总统戴高乐在他的新年广播讲话中重申法国不愿意
  “被卷入一场不是我们的战争”。美联社说：法国各阶层人士“强烈希望不仅不要参加，而且要以某种行动反对这种政策”。
    英国政府虽然支持美国政府，但是，由于遇到人民群众和工党内部左翼力量的反对，和在镇压殖民地解放运动方面也是顾此失彼、焦头烂额，“英国的支持完全是外交上的，没有提供其他直接援助。”（美联社语）
    西德虽然支持美国侵略，然而对提供军事援助的要求也表现冷淡和戒心。西德各党派都反对西德派兵去南越。执政党基督教民主联盟——基督教社会联盟议会党团主席巴泽尔三日强调说：“北大西洋公约组织以外的军事义务不是我们的事情。”
    美联社驻西欧各国首都记者最近就这个问题作了一次调查。调查结果表明，“就大多数欧洲人而论，美国人在越南主要得依靠自己的努力。”
      矛盾重重　众叛亲离
    由于侵越战争连遭失败，走投无路，国内国外困难重重，美国统治集团内部也是矛盾百出，争吵纷纭。美国朝野在去年一年内对越南问题一直进行无休无止的争论，约翰逊受到来自四面八方的攻击。例如共和党的领导机构——共和党政策协调委员会十二月十三日发表声明，公开指责约翰逊“领导无方”。共和党还曾经发表白皮书，指责民主党政府应对造成侵越战争的“危机”负责。在民主党内部，包括莫尔斯、格伦宁、丘奇、麦克戈温甚至富布赖特、曼斯菲尔德和罗伯特·肯尼迪在内的越来越多的参议员，也在不同的程度上对约翰逊的政策表示不满，对美国政府不断扩大战争的危险后果表示不安。据美国报刊统计，在国会里，几乎有一半参议员是对约翰逊扩大战争表示疑虑的。在政府内部，尽管约翰逊力图维持表面“团结”，但是各派系之间在如何挽救美国败局的策略问题上分歧日益激烈。用美国报刊的话说，“越南战争已经打到华盛顿来了！”
    约翰逊这种内外交困，四面楚歌的悲惨景况，是美国过去任何一个总统都没有遭到过的。（附图片）
