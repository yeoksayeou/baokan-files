    Our country has achieved sixteen significant scientific and technological results in the chemical industry, most of which have been applied to production. Some of these achievements have caught up with the world's advanced levels, and some have surpassed them. Projects that have already been put into production took only a few years from research to promotion, with the fastest taking only five months. In foreign countries, the same projects take anywhere from a dozen to several decades. This is truly high speed, this is a real Great Leap Forward, this is a great victory in catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced level in chemical production.
    The great significance of these sixteen scientific and technological achievements is not only material, but more importantly, spiritual. It once again proves with eloquent facts that our country can completely change the backwardness of science and technology within a not-too-long historical period and catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels.
    Why is this? It is because we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.
    The scientific and technological personnel who participated in the research of these sixteen achievements said that in the past they only looked to Chairman Mao's works when they had ideological problems, and could only consult foreign literature when they had technical problems. However, after hitting snags and detours many times in their practice of studying technology, they finally realized that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the best weapon for transforming society and transforming people, but also the best guide for uncovering the secrets of science and technology. The sixteen major scientific and technological achievements were all quickly successful under the enlightenment and guidance of Chairman Mao's works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction". This understanding, gained from practice, is very profound and enlightening to people.
    Some people may wonder, how can Mao Zedong Thought solve technical problems? Indeed, Mao Zedong Thought does not solve specific technical problems, but Mao Zedong Thought, first of all, in terms of people's ideological revolutionization, can give people courage, wisdom, and change the old attitude towards technological reform, and replace it with an attitude of making technological revolution for the people and for the revolution. This power is unparalleled. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought can very well solve the direction of technological development. This is the fundamental problem of technological development. As long as this problem is solved, the direction is correct, and the law is found, won't all specific technical problems be easily solved?
    For example, should we blindly believe in foreign books and foreign frameworks, or should we believe in ourselves and take our own path? Should we rely only on scientific and technical personnel, or should we rely on the broad masses of people? Should we block each other, or should we adopt the "three-in-one" combination of inside and outside? This is the direction of technological development. If this directional problem is not solved, even if many specific technical problems are solved, the result can only be less, slower, worse, and more expensive; it can only crawl behind others. If this directional problem is solved, technical problems can be solved faster and better, and the result must be more, faster, better, and more economical; we will certainly be able to catch up with others. The chemical industry's achievement of sixteen major scientific and technological results, and the fact that it was able to achieve such high speed, is the result of first arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and solving the problem of the direction of technological development.
    One of the main signs of ideological transformation of scientific and technical personnel is to see whether they dare to liberate their minds, break superstitions, and despise foreign countries and the country's existing inadequate achievements in technology. If the technical thinking of technical personnel cannot be liberated from the shackles of blindly believing in foreign frameworks and old technologies, it shows that the ideological transformation has not made much progress, or that even if there has been progress, it is not yet consolidated.
    Scientific and technological work must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. This means that not only must Mao Zedong Thought be used to solve problems in the political and ideological fields, but also Mao Zedong Thought must be used to solve problems in the technical and ideological fields. Ideological problems and technical problems cannot be completely separated. The so-called "only looking to Chairman Mao's works when there are ideological problems, and only consulting foreign literature when there are technical problems" is the result of the technical thinking of blindly believing in foreign frameworks. If this ideological problem is not solved, it is impossible for Mao Zedong Thought to be in command in technology, and only foreign frameworks can be in command.
    The sixteen scientific and technological achievements in the chemical industry tell us that as long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to command scientific and technological work and transform the thinking of scientific and technical personnel, our country's science and technology can develop more, faster, better, and more economically, and can catch

    发展科学技术要走自己的道路
    我国在化学工业方面，取得了十六项意义重大的科学技术成果，大部分已经用于生产。这些成果有的赶上了世界先进水平，有的超过了世界先进水平。已经用于生产的项目，从研究到推广，只用了几年的时间，其中最快的只用了五个月的时间。而在外国，同样的项目，短则十几年，长则几十年。这是真正的高速度，这是真正的大跃进，这是在化工生产方面赶上和超过世界先进水平的大胜利。
    这十六项科学技术成果的伟大意义不仅是物质的，更重要的是精神的，它再一次以雄辩的事实证明，我国能够在不太长的历史时期内，彻底改变科学技术的落后面貌，赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    这是为什么？就是因为我们有战无不胜攻无不克的毛泽东思想。
    参加研究这十六项成果的科学技术人员说：他们过去是在思想有问题的时候才找毛主席著作，技术有问题的时候只能请教外国文献。但是，他们在钻研技术的实践中碰了多少次钉子，走了多少次弯路之后，终于觉悟到，毛泽东思想不仅是改造社会、改造人的思想的最好武器，而且也是揭开科学技术秘密的最好指南。十六项重大科学技术新成果，都是在毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等著作的启示和指导下迅速获得成功的。这种从实践中得来的体会非常深切，对人们很有启发。
    有人也许奇怪，毛泽东思想怎么能解决技术问题呢？的确，毛泽东思想并不解决具体的技术问题，但是，毛泽东思想首先在人的思想革命化方面，能给人以勇气、智慧，改变旧的对待技术改革的态度，而换上为人民、为革命而闹技术革命的态度，这个力量是无比的。因而毛泽东思想就能够很好地解决技术发展的方向问题。这是发展技术的根本问题，只要这个问题解决了，方向对头了，规律摸到了，一切具体的技术问题不就容易解决了吗？
    比如，是迷信洋书、洋框框呢？还是相信自己，走自己的路呢？是只靠科学技术人员呢？还是依靠广大群众呢？是相互封锁，还是采用内外三结合呢？这就是发展技术的方向问题。不解决这个方向问题，即使解决了很多具体技术问题，结果还只能是少慢差费，只能跟在别人后面爬行。解决了这个方向问题，技术问题就能解决得更快更好，结果一定是多快好省，一定能迎头赶上别人。化工方面取得十六项重大科学技术成果，所以能有如此高的速度，就是首先用毛泽东思想把人们的思想武装起来，解决了发展技术的方向问题的结果。
    科学技术人员思想改造的主要标志之一，就是看他们敢不敢解放思想，破除迷信，在技术上蔑视外国，蔑视本国已有的不够的成就。如果技术人员的技术思想不能从迷信洋框框迷信老技术的束缚中解放出来，就说明思想改造还没有多大成绩，或者说有了成绩也还不巩固。
    科学技术工作必须用毛泽东思想挂帅，这意思就是，不但要用毛泽东思想解决政治思想方面的问题，也要用毛泽东思想解决技术思想方面的问题。思想问题和技术问题是不可能截然分开的。所谓“思想有问题的时候才找毛主席著作，技术有问题的时候只能请教外国文献”，这就是迷信洋框框的技术思想在作祟，不解决这个思想问题，在技术上就不可能是毛泽东思想挂帅，只能是洋框框挂帅。
    化工方面十六项科学技术成果告诉我们，只要用毛泽东思想统帅科学技术工作，改造科学技术人员的思想，我国的科学技术就能多快好省地发展，就能更快地赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    化工方面十六项科学技术成果给我们增加了赶上和超过世界先进水平的信心和力量，给我们指出了赶上和超过世界先进水平的正确方向：彻底打破洋框框的束缚，发展科学技术要坚决走自己的道路。
