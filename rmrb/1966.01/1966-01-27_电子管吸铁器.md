    Electronic Tube Iron Remover
    Qin Jinhui, a young worker at the Nantong Tangzha Coal Ball Cooperative Factory, has created a simple and easy-to-use electronic tube iron remover, solving a problem urgently needed to be solved by many coal ball factories.

    Raw coal often contains iron impurities, which must be removed before it can be used to process coal powder to make coal balls and honeycomb briquettes. In the past, the tools used by general coal ball factories to remove iron were inefficient, and the iron was not cleaned thoroughly, often causing accidents in which the iron damaged the pulverizer and coal ball machine, affecting production.

    Nineteen-year-old Qin Jinhui, with the support of the factory leaders, was determined to create a new tool to solve the problem of iron impurities damaging the machines. He only had a primary school education and a slight understanding of electrical knowledge. However, he diligently studied "On Practice," followed Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly practiced, and finally improved this technology, creating a simple and low-cost electronic tube iron remover that can suck out iron nails, iron sheets, and iron blocks from coal.

    After the Tangzha Coal Ball Cooperative Factory used this iron remover, the accidents of iron impurities damaging the machines were eliminated, and the machine's operating rate increased from 94 percent to 99.8 percent. Currently, this iron remover has been widely promoted in various coal ball factories in Shanghai.

    电子管吸铁器
    南通市唐闸煤球合作工厂青工秦锦慧制成一种简单好用的电子管吸铁器，解决了许多煤球厂迫切需要解决的问题。
    原煤中常常夹杂着一些铁质杂物，需要加以清除才能用来加工煤粉制造煤球和蜂窝煤。过去一般煤球厂清除杂铁用的工具，效率低，杂铁清理不干净，常常造成杂铁损坏粉碎机、煤球机的事故，影响生产。
    十九岁的秦锦慧在工厂领导的支持下，决心创制出一种新工具解决杂铁损坏机器的问题。他只有高小文化程度，略懂一点电气知识。但是他认真学习了《实践论》，遵照毛主席的教导，不断实践，终于改进了这项技术，制出结构简单、造价低的电子管吸铁器，能吸出煤炭里的铁钉、铁皮和铁块。
    唐闸煤球合作工厂使用这种吸铁器之后，消灭了杂铁损坏机器的事故，机器的运转率由百分之九十四提高到百分之九十九点八。目前，这种吸铁器已经在上海各煤球厂普遍推广。
