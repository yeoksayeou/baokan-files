    Knowing and Doing
    Some comrades believe that the older revolutionary comrades have experienced "mountains of knives and seas of fire," and the comrades who started working after liberation have undergone years of education and training by the Party and know that we are serving the people. This statement is generally correct. But just knowing is not enough; it is more important to do it. "Knowing" is relatively easy, but "doing" is not so simple. Even veteran comrades who have participated in "mountains of knives and seas of fire" struggles may find their thinking lagging behind the development of the revolutionary situation as it constantly evolves. This is specifically manifested in an unclear understanding of whom to serve. Due to various reasons, they forget that serving the people is the starting point and purpose of all our work. Mistakes and errors in work are caused by forgetting whom we serve. There are many examples of this. If we truly have a correct understanding of "serving whom," we will have methods for "how to serve." In our work, we will do what is beneficial to the revolution and the people, and we will not do what is detrimental to the revolution and the people. Even if some shortcomings arise, as long as we have the correct thinking of serving the people and humbly learn from the masses, we will find the correct "methods of service" from the lessons of failure. Therefore, truly serving the people depends not on knowing, but on doing. To serve the people at all times and in all matters, we must constantly use proletarian ideology to overcome all kinds of non-proletarian ideas.

    知道和做到
    有的同志认为：老革命同志经历过“刀山火海”，解放后参加工作的同志，经过党的多年培养教育，都知道我们是为人民服务的。这种说法，一般地说是对的。但只是知道还不行，更重要的是做到。“知道”比较容易，要“做到”就不那么简单。即使是参加过
  “刀山火海”斗争的老同志，因为革命形势不断发展，也有思想跟不上形势发展的情况，具体表现就是为谁服务的观点不明确，由于种种原因，忘记了为人民服务是我们一切工作的出发点和目的。工作出缺点、犯错误，就是因为忘了为谁服务造成的，这样的例子是不少的。如果真正对“为谁服务”有了正确认识，就会有“如何服务”的方法，在工作中有利于革命、有利于人民的事就干，不利于革命、不利于人民的事就不干。即使产生了一些缺点，只要我们有为人民服务的正确思想，虚心地向群众学习，也会从失败的教训中找出正确的“服务方法”来。因此，真正地为人民服务，关键不在知道，而在做到。要做到时时事事为人民服务，就得不断地用无产阶级思想，克服各种非无产阶级思想。
