    Starting from the Basic Issue of Social Needs
    A Discussion of a Problem in Socialist Political Economy Research
    Wu Qiang
    In any practice, including scientific research, it is often unavoidable to revisit basic questions in order to understand the complex problems currently encountered.
    Political and economic research on the socialist mode of production is one of the more difficult tasks. The knowledge accumulated in this area over the past few years (both positive and negative) is more than what was accumulated in the past decades. Practical life has raised many questions worth rethinking, and the question of commodities is one of them.
    In the process of socialist reproduction, in the distribution of consumer goods and a portion of the means of production, countless commodities are still circulating, and a significant portion of the labor products of socialist society still take the form of commodities, with the tools of value being widely used in practice.
    This phenomenon is dazzling. How exactly is this phenomenon to be explained?
    To argue that there is no commodity production and exchange, no "trade" here is, of course, difficult to justify seriously; however, to believe that all commodities are necessarily capitalist, or fundamentally capitalist, is neither in line with historical facts (since commodity production predates capitalism) nor can it explain the true situation of commodity production under the socialist system.
    Confusion leads one back to the starting point. What is the purpose of socialist production, and how does it differ from capitalist production? This seems to raise a question of common sense. Who doesn't know that socialist production is to ensure social needs, "aiming at satisfying the needs of the whole society and of each member of society" (Engels); while capitalist production, in general, is carried out by capitalists to obtain surplus value. These are, of course, two fundamentally different types of production. However, this common sense question is also the most basic question. If the research on the socialist part of political economy deviates from this question even slightly, it will make some already complex problems even more confusing.
    Socialist production, or a large part of this production, often needs to take a tortuous path to achieve its purpose, requiring the use of value tools. This situation easily leads some people to forget the ultimate goal of social needs in practice.
    The reason why socialist society still needs commodity production and exchange is mainly because although socialist society has realized public ownership of the means of production, there are still two different forms of socialist ownership. Under these conditions, commodity forms expressing economic relations are generated, and a portion of labor products become commodities. Commodity production transforms various concrete labors into abstract labor that creates value, that is, equal human labor, enabling different products to be exchanged at equal value.
    The huge wealth of capitalist production is expressed as "an immense collection of commodities" (Marx). The huge wealth controlled by the socialist mode of production, of course, cannot be viewed in this way. Commodity production in socialist society is a part of socialist production (not dominant), not something outside of socialist production. In other words, socialist commodities cannot be separated from socialist production and regarded as part of that "immense collection of commodities" of capitalism.
    The content contained in the commodity form of labor products is a historically determined social production relationship. Socialist commodities (excluding the very few privately produced commodities) have fundamentally different characteristics from the commodities of capitalist society and other privately owned societies, namely: (1) It is based on socialist public ownership. Its premise is that labor is no longer a commodity; labor has eliminated its general private nature and has direct social character. (2) Production is for social needs, and exchange is not the ultimate goal. (3) The production and exchange of commodities are planned, not anarchic.
    If we do not regard commodity production as something independent and free from the surrounding economic conditions, then, for commodities under the socialist system, we must see these aspects simultaneously in order to comprehensively recognize their true nature, which differs from the commodities of privately owned societies.
    Commodities within the socialist state-owned economy and commodities exchanged between the collective economy and the state-owned economy all have these characteristics. Compared with each other, only the degree of socialization and planning is different.
    Here, it is necessary to raise a question: are commodities under the socialist system produced only for exchange? Are they produced merely as value? How does political economy study the "duality of commodities" under the socialist system?
    According to the usual concept, a commodity is a product that is not produced for one's own use but for exchanging other products. In the sense of ordinary commodity science, this is, of course, the truth, even the only truth. However, for the purpose of socialist commodity production, in the political and economic sense, this statement appears insufficient and incomplete because it is too far removed from the surrounding economic conditions; it has not even been able to go beyond the narrow boundaries of private ownership.
    Commodities under the socialist system are, of course, also exchanged for each other as value. Without exchange, without value, there is no such thing as a commodity. However, as mentioned above, exchange is not the purpose for socialist commodity production, just as buying and selling are not the principle of socialist production, although socialist production cannot be separated from buying and selling relationships. For commodities in socialist society, exchange, in addition to being its attribute, is more importantly a medium through which economic ties of society are realized and social needs are guaranteed, including the mutual needs of commodity-owning units.
    How do we explain to the workers of state-owned enterprises the nature of the labor products they produce that take the form of commodities? Can we only point out that this is produced for exchange? Can we say that this is only for others and not at the same time for ourselves, for the whole society?
    Even for collective economies and the owners of their products, if we only point out the "for exchange" aspect of their commodity production without emphasizing the social purpose and significance of this production, it can only be regarded as "irrelevant." This will forever confine the peasants' vision to the smaller circle of collective interests, making them only pay attention to the economic interests of their own collective and unit, while forgetting the significant social significance. How can producers have the ideological awareness of doing a good job in production responsibly to society and the revolution? In this way, the promotion of production can only rely on some so-called economic incentives.
    To believe that the production of such commodities is only for exchange simply because commodities in socialist society are also used for exchange is, like believing that socialist production is for consumption (denying accumulation and expanded reproduction) because socialist production is to meet needs, an obvious misunderstanding.
    Perhaps some people say: this is no longer an explanation of the original meaning of commodities, but a social education issue. We believe that this is precisely where the problem lies.
    Some people can verbally admit that commodities in socialist society have extremely important differences from commodities in capitalist society, but in practice, they still equate commodities in socialist society with commodities in the general sense (or called "original meaning") of privately owned societies, without pointing out that the former has new characteristics and significance due to the completely different conditions and purposes of production (acknowledging the remnants of capitalism in it is another matter). They view commodities in isolation, separating them from the entire socialist economic movement. They believe that socialist production relations and the aim of meeting social needs do not determine the nature of commodity production under the socialist system. Therefore, they draw the strange conclusion that commodities under the socialist system are all capitalist in nature.
    Meeting social needs is the purpose of socialist production, and of course, it is also the purpose of commodity production as a part of socialist production. Making producers realize the social significance of the labor they are engaged in, starting from the interests of the entire society and the entire country, instead of only seeing the interests of their own factory, unit, and collective—this is not an added "social education task" but precisely something essential contained within the specific commodity production relations of socialism.
    In political economy, this naturally involves the study of the duality of commodities under the socialist system (under the socialist system, some non-commodity production areas also use the form of value, so their products also have a contradiction between value and use value in a special sense and in some form).
    The purpose of capitalist production is to produce surplus value, so the capitalist part of political economy naturally places its focus on the aspect of value. Marx's "Capital," grasping the commodity, the most basic thing in capitalist society, began with a simple analysis of use value and then turned to the study of exchange value and the inherent value of commodities, unfolding the economic movement of capitalism step by step around value and surplus value. Of course, it also constantly mentions the use value as the material bearer of value and as the means of production used by capitalists, but the central point is about value, about the production and realization of surplus value. Capitalists are interested in use value only because it is the bearer of value and surplus value.
    The most basic purpose of socialist production, including commodity production, is to meet social needs. Therefore, socialist political economy should also naturally regard the analysis of use value as a focus. That is to say, when we study the regularity of the socialist mode of production, we must focus on studying how to produce products with various use values that meet social needs in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and how to rationally distribute them so as to provide a good material basis for the expanded reproduction of socialist production relations; study the production of use values, especially the production of the means of production and consumer goods, how the production of various departments can achieve a reasonable proportional relationship; study the characteristics of the contradiction between use value and value under the socialist system, and the policies and methods for resolving this contradiction, and so on.
    This issue was raised by some in China's economic circles a few years ago, but no systematic theoretical analysis has been conducted. Although its proposal has been ridiculed as "natural economic theory," it has become increasingly clear that socialist political economy should attach importance to this issue. The Party's general line for socialist construction actually raises the necessity of conducting this research from an important perspective. At present, practical life is even more prominently pushing this issue onto the agenda of political economy research.
    The socialist state's planned leadership of the national economy must, of course, consider both the value and use value of commodities or products, rather than just considering the use value aspect. The state plans production not only with physical indicators but also with price indicators. Continuously reducing the value of the commodities or products produced and, on this basis, reducing prices is of great significance for ensuring the satisfaction of social needs. In the socialist economy, the contradiction between value and use value occurs frequently, especially when products are overstocked and unsalable due to poor quality and failure to meet needs, or when enterprises pursue the production of more profitable products and fail to complete the product variety plan and quality plan, the contradiction between value and use value will become prominent. Here, there is first a question of the starting point of production.
    Does the commodity production of socialism, as well as the production of all products that need to utilize the value form, start from the production of products with various use values to meet the needs of various aspects of society, or does it start from exchange, from value? The question of the starting point is a very important matter of principle. Only when the starting point is right can the contradiction between value and use value be resolved well.
    Some comrades believe that the products "exchanged" within the economy of ownership by the whole people are produced to meet the needs of the country and the people from the perspective of the entire country, and they produce use value; but from the perspective of each enterprise, these products are only produced as value because the enterprise does not use them. It must be pointed out that this method of separating the country and the enterprise in looking at the problem (use value from the perspective of the country, value from the perspective of the enterprise) is incorrect and specious. This is actually still treating the products "exchanged" within the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people with the view of commodities in privately owned societies. This inevitably puts the starting point of enterprise production in the wrong place.
    Let's take the production of timber as an example. Timber is an important material resource indispensable for national construction and the production and life of the people. With the development of socialist construction, the demand for this material resource is increasing in all aspects. State-owned forest enterprises engaged in timber production and expanding timber production are starting from this point. Each enterprise manages timber, not starting from exchanging other products, from obtaining profits, although this management widely uses the form of value, not only the distribution to the civil sector must implement equivalent exchange, but also the distribution to other state-owned departments must obtain equivalent compensation through accounting. Implementing equivalent exchange, equivalent compensation, and obtaining necessary profits are conditions for socialist production, but not the purpose of socialist production.
    If each forest enterprise only knows that timber is produced for exchange, that is, only produced as value, and does not pay attention to whether they can meet the needs of all aspects of society from the aspect of use value, it will lose its direction and cause various wastes. For example, in timber production, if we look at the problem from the perspective of pure exchange, then producing large-sized timber is beneficial, both in terms of organizing production, transportation, and obtaining profits. Under the current conditions, the labor spent on the production of small-sized timber is much greater than the labor spent on the production of large-sized timber, and there are many problems in transportation, which will inevitably increase costs, so it seems a bit uneconomical. However, social needs are diverse, requiring both large-sized timber and small-sized timber. Agricultural, light industrial, handicraft production, and the daily necessities of the people require a large amount of small-sized timber. If this problem is not solved, it will not only be unfavorable to the entire socialist production, but also another problem will arise in timber production, that is, the forest resources cannot be fully utilized, the timber yield per unit area of the forest cannot be increased, and the phenomenon of using large timber for small purposes and wasting timber will occur.
    Here, a contradiction between value and use value is exposed. This contradiction needs to be resolved in accordance with socialist principles.
    Our production should first consider social needs. However, starting from social needs, can we ignore the value aspect? Of course not. In order to increase the production of small-sized timber, in addition to including small-sized timber produced by forest enterprises in the production plan, determining the production tasks of small-sized timber, and specifying the output indicators and quality requirements of large-sized timber and small-sized timber as much as possible when issuing timber production plans, one important aspect for relevant departments is to appropriately adjust the ex-factory price of timber according to the size of the timber and the amount of production costs. Sales prices should also be adjusted accordingly. Appropriately implement "using large to supplement small" in terms of profits. At the same time, wage quotas should be formulated separately according to the different efficiency of producing large and small sized timber, and the principle of distribution according to work should be implemented to promote workers' enthusiasm for producing small-sized timber.
    The socialist economic movement is full of contradictions like this. Obviously, we cannot forget the starting point and let value and the law of value lead us by the nose.
    Then, what is the position of value and the law of value in socialist production? This is an old question, but it may be worth raising again in new circumstances.
    The economic category of value is still widely used under the socialist system, not only in commodity production but also in non-commodity production. Due to the unity of the social reproduction process, since socialist society cannot abolish commodity production, therefore, not only a part of the products exchanged as commodities have value, but also another part of the products that do not exchange as commodities, such as the main means of production produced by state-owned enterprises, also use value and its various forms to calculate the amount of labor consumed, transform concrete labor into abstract labor, in order to carry out value accounting of labor. This is inevitable before society can directly measure the amount of labor consumed for the production of a certain product in terms of labor time. Therefore, the importance of value under the socialist system as both the basis of exchange and the measure of labor and consumption can be imagined.
    What the law of value reveals is nothing more than that the value of a product must be determined by the amount of socially necessary labor consumed in producing this product. This law provides a basis for the planned leadership of production in socialist society.
    Some people say that under the socialist system, value along with its various forms (price, currency, etc.) and the law of value can only belong to capitalism and are capitalist economic categories and laws. It is hard to see how much basis this statement has. This is an issue that needs to be discussed. However, it is true that wherever value and the law of value play a role, it is often where capitalist factors are prone to grow and be active. Facts indicate that this is a zone full of struggle in socialist production.
    When we enter the zone where value and the law of value are active, if we cannot adopt a conscious attitude, the result will often obscure the purpose of socialist production. For example, socialist production is to produce more and better products with various use values, but sometimes the overall indication of production conditions in the form of value, the transformation of concrete labor into abstract labor, masks the use value itself. In this case, if we only judge the activities of an enterprise based on the value situation, for example, based on the completion of price indicators, without asking whether it has completed the production task in terms of use value, then there is every possibility of leading the enterprise astray.
    The socialist plan leadership of enterprises first requires enterprises to complete a certain variety and product quantity plan, and requires the product to meet certain quality requirements. That is, first, to complete the state's production plan in terms of physical form, in terms of use value. At the same time, it also requires the completion of the plan in terms of output value (price), cost, profit, etc. If we do not first focus on requiring the former, or even abandon the requirements in terms of physical form and use value on the pretext of expanding the enterprise's initiative, so that the enterprise one-sidedly pursues the completion of the task in terms of output value, that is, price indicators, and even regards profit as the central indicator, then it is far away from the purpose of socialist production. And price indicators, profits, etc. can be obtained by various improper means (such as changing the variety of products, ignoring product quality, conducting market speculation, changing the method of using raw materials, ignoring the repair of fixed assets, etc.) completely in violation of the purpose of socialist production and the main production tasks. This is to promote enterprises to embark on the road of capitalist free competition. Revisionists are doing just that.
    We all know that value and the law of value existed in pre-capitalist social forms, existed in capitalist society, and now exist in socialist society. They play a role in the production of these societies and have played a great role in the development of capitalist production, but they do not determine the essence and foundation of the production of each of these societies. In pre-capitalist social forms, although the law of value is a spontaneous force, and although the role of the law of value will promote the growth of certain capitalist factors at a certain stage of commodity production, only value and the law of value themselves cannot directly lead to capitalism. Only with the cooperation of other necessary conditions (private ownership of the means of production, labor appearing on the market as a commodity, and thus the emergence of the wage labor system, etc.) will the activity of value and the law of value lead to capitalism.
    The socialist society generally excludes the above conditions. Socialist countries regard value as one of the important tools in organizing planned production. At this time, the law of value generally no longer becomes a force dominating people. However, socialist society is produced from capitalist society, and it still retains the vestiges of capitalism in all aspects; blind forces and factors that are not led by the state plan still exist everywhere; the spontaneous action of the law of value, which once had a wide range of action, has also left a very profound impact on the real economic life and people's consciousness, forming a stubborn habitual force.
    These negative factors and forces in socialist society are not easily completely eliminated because value and the law of value continue to play a role within a certain range. They often find the best "air-raid shelter" here, find a place to parasitize, and are prone to launching activities; on the other hand, if the activities of value and the law of value in socialist society are combined with these forces, factors, and forces, it will easily liberate its original spontaneousness, which was only restrained, and become something that is completely contrary to the purpose of socialist production and the law of planned development.
    In socialist society, the activities of the forces representing capitalism in the economic field are often first and foremost an attempt to release the spontaneous forces of value and the law of value, to revoke all restrictions, to put value in the first place in economic life, to use profit as the main indicator of enterprise management, and thereby lead to things such as the average rate of profit and even disguised wage labor, opening up the economic path for the restoration of capitalism.
    From the above, it is not difficult to see that political economy is facing various complex situations in the study of the socialist economic movement. We say that value and the law of value are a "great school," which mainly refers to: (1) True socialist production leaders must learn to use value as a tool to correctly calculate labor consumption and save labor, understand how to implement economic accounting, tap potential, rationally formulate prices based on the principle of combining long-term interests and immediate interests, and promote the development of production, and so on.
    (2) In this field, there is a contest between socialist and capitalist forces, and between planned and spontaneous forces. We must learn to restrain the role of value within the scope permitted by socialism. We must learn to fight against all capitalist factors, forces, and spontaneous forces, and have the ability to defeat them.
    Can we think that this is the fault of value and the law of value themselves, and therefore must declare that they are capitalist in nature? It seems unnecessary, even if the above situation exists. This way of treating the problem is actually too simplistic. The problem lies in putting value in the right place and within a certain range, without forgetting that the purpose of socialist production (including commodity production) is to meet social needs. Commodities in socialist society are not produced merely as value, and value should especially not be used as a fog to cover use value, under which anything can happen. Value is a tool, not an end. If this tool is used properly and controlled well, it can benefit socialism; if it is used improperly, cannot be controlled, or even if the thing used as a tool is mistakenly regarded as the end itself, then it will of course cause various serious consequences, even (in coordination with other conditions) leading to capitalism.
    In summary, political economy's research on the socialist economic movement cannot be separated from the basic point and central point of meeting social needs, and cannot put the focus on value instead of on use value. Due to the complexity of socialist production, the tortuous roads from production to consumption, and the need to use many economic levers, it forces us to constantly return to the basic viewpoint mentioned above when analyzing various specific problems, and the discussion of some current problems also shows that it is necessary to do so. —The above opinions are respectfully requested from comrades in the economic field.

    从社会需要这个基本问题出发
    漫谈社会主义政治经济学研究中的一个问题
    乌强
    在任何实践中，科学研究也一样，总是常常不免要回过头去复习基本的问题，以便弄清楚当前遇到的复杂问题。
    对于社会主义生产方式进行政治经济学的研究，是步履比较艰难的任务之一。几年来在这方面积累的认识资料（正面的和反面的），比过去几十年所积累的还要多。实际生活提出了许多值得重新思考的问题，商品问题就是其中的一个。
    在社会主义再生产的过程中，在消费品和一部分生产资料的分配过程中，仍然有无数商品在流动，社会主义社会的劳动产品的相当部分还是采取商品的形式，在实践中广泛运用价值的工具。
    这种现象令人眼花缭乱。究竟如何解释这种现象？
    认为这里不存在商品生产和商品交换，不存在“贸易”，这当然是很难说得出认真的理由来的；但是，如果认为凡是商品都必然是资本主义的，或者基本上是资本主义的，这既不合历史事实（因为商品生产是先行于资本主义的东西），也完全不能说明社会主义制度下商品生产的真实情况。
    困惑使人回到出发点。究竟社会主义生产的目的是什么，它和资本主义生产有什么不同？这里仿佛提出了一个常识问题。谁人不知：社会主义生产是为了保证社会需要，“是以满足全社会以及社会每一成员的需要为目的的”（恩格斯）；而资本主义的生产，一般地说，是资本家为了获得剩余价值而进行的。这当然是两种根本不同的生产。但是，这个常识问题同时又是一个最基本的问题。政治经济学社会主义部分的研究如果稍微偏离这个问题，就会使一些本来复杂的问题更加纠缠不清。
    社会主义生产，或者这个生产的很大一部分，为达到它的目的，往往要经过迂回曲折的道路，需要运用价值的工具，这种情况容易使一些人在实际上忘记社会需要这个最后的目的。
    社会主义社会之所以仍然需要有商品生产和商品交换，从主要方面说来，是因为社会主义社会虽然实现了生产资料公有制，但还存在着两种不同形式的社会主义所有制。在这种条件下，产生表现经济关系的商品形式，一部分劳动产品成为商品。商品生产把各种具体劳动转化为创造价值的抽象劳动，即等一的人类劳动，使不同的产品能够进行等价交换。
    资本主义生产的巨大财富表现为“一个惊人庞大的商品堆”（马克思）。对社会主义生产方式所支配的巨大财富当然不能这样看。社会主义社会的商品生产，是社会主义生产的一部分（不占统治地位），不是社会主义生产以外的东西。换句话说，不能把社会主义社会的商品同社会主义生产割裂开来，把它看作是资本主义那个“惊人庞大的商品堆”的一部分。
    劳动产品的商品形式所包含的内容，是历史上一定的社会生产关系。社会主义社会的商品（除掉为数极少的私人生产的商品）同资本主义社会的商品以及其他私有制社会的商品相比，有它从根本上区别于其他商品的特性，这就是：（一）它以社会主义公有制为基础。它的前提是：劳动力不再是商品；劳动已消除了一般私人性质，而具有了直接的社会性。（二）为社会需要而生产，交换并不是最后目的。（三）商品的生产和交换是有计划的，不是无政府状态的。
    如果我们不把商品生产看作是某种不依赖于周围经济条件而独立自在的东西，那末，对于社会主义制度下的商品，必须同时看到这几个方面，才能够比较全面地认识它的不同于私有制社会商品的真实面貌。
    社会主义国营经济内部的商品和集体经济与国营经济之间交换的商品，一概具有这些特性，两者比较起来，只不过社会化和计划化的程度不同罢了。
    这里必须提出一个问题：社会主义制度下的商品只是为交换而生产的吗？它仅仅是当作价值而被生产出来的吗？政治经济学怎样研究社会主义制度下“商品的两重性”？
    按照通常的概念，商品是这样一种产品，它不是为着自己使用，而是为着交换其他产品而被生产出来的。在普通商品学的意义上，这说的当然是真理，甚至是唯一的真理。但是，对于社会主义商品生产的目的来说，从政治经济学的意义上说，这种说法却因为过于离开周围经济条件而显得不充分、不完全，它甚至没有能够越出私有制的狭隘界限。
    社会主义制度下的商品当然也是表现为价值而被互相交换的。离开交换，离开价值，就无所谓商品。但是，如上所说，交换对于社会主义的商品生产来说并不是目的，正好象买卖不是社会主义生产的原则一样，虽然社会主义生产同样不能离开买卖的关系。对于社会主义社会的商品，交换除了是它的属性而外，更重要的是一种媒介，通过它，实现社会的经济联系，保证社会的需要，其中包括商品所有单位相互的需要。
    我们怎样向国营企业工人们说明他们所生产的取商品形式的劳动产品的性质呢？难道能够仅仅指明这是为交换而生产的吗？能够说这只是为别人而不同时为自己、为整个社会吗？
    即使对于集体经济及其产品的所有者，如果对于他们的商品生产仅只指出“为交换”这一点，而不着重说明这种生产的社会目的和意义，也只能算是“言不及义”。这将永远使农民的眼光局限于较小范围的集体利益的圈子，使他们只注意本集体、本单位的经济利益，而忘掉重大的社会意义。这样，怎么能够使生产者具有对社会、对革命负责的搞好生产的思想觉悟呢？这样，对于生产的推动实际上也只好依靠某种所谓经济刺激办法。
    因为社会主义社会的商品同样要被用来进行交换这一点而认为这种商品的生产仅只是为了交换，这如同因为社会主义生产是为了满足需要而认为这种生产乃是为消费而生产（否认积累和扩大再生产）一样，是一种显然的误解。
    也许有人说：这已经不是解释商品本来的意义，而是一个社会教育问题了。我们认为，问题也正是在这里。
    有的人能够在口头上承认社会主义社会的商品同资本主义社会的商品有着极其重要的区别，但是，实际上还是把社会主义社会的商品等同于私有制社会的一般意义（或者叫做“本来意义”）的商品，而不指出前者由于生产的条件和目的全然不同已具有了新的性质和意义（承认其中有资本主义的残迹，那是另一问题）。他们把商品这东西孤立起来看，使之脱离开整个社会主义经济运动。认为社会主义生产关系和为着满足社会需要这一点，并不决定社会主义制度下商品生产的性质。因而得出社会主义制度下的商品一概是资本主义性质的这种奇怪的结论。
    满足社会需要，是社会主义生产的目的，当然也是作为社会主义生产的一部分的商品生产的目的。使生产者认识到他们所从事的劳动的社会意义，从整个社会、整个国家的利益出发，而不只看到本厂、本单位、本集体的利益，——这不是什么外加的“社会教育任务”，而正是包含在社会主义特种商品生产关系之内的本质性的东西。
    在政治经济学上，这就自然而然地涉及到了对于社会主义制度下的商品的两重性的研究（在社会主义制度下，一些非商品生产领域也运用价值的形式，所以其产品在特殊意义上、在某种形式上也有价值和使用价值的矛盾）。
    资本主义生产的目的是为了生产剩余价值，所以政治经济学资本主义部分很自然地把注意的重点放在价值这一方面。马克思的《资本论》，抓住商品这个资本主义社会最基本的东西，一开头对使用价值只作了简单的分析，就转入了交换价值及商品内在的价值的研究，围绕着价值和剩余价值，一步一步地展开了资本主义的经济运动。当然，其中也不断提到作为价值的物质担当者和作为资本家所运用的生产资料的使用价值，但中心点是讲价值，讲剩余价值的生产和实现。资本家对使用价值有兴趣，只因为它是价值和剩余价值的承担者。
    社会主义生产包括商品生产的最基本的目的是为了满足社会需要，因此，社会主义政治经济学也很自然地要把对使用价值的分析当作一个着重点。这就是说，我们在研究社会主义生产方式的规律性的时候，必须着重地去研究如何多、快、好、省地生产出合乎社会需要的具有各种使用价值的产品，并且如何合理地分配它们，以便很好地为社会主义生产关系之扩大再生产提供物质基础；研究使用价值的生产，特别是生产资料和消费资料的生产，各部门的生产，如何达到合理的比例关系；研究社会主义制度下使用价值和价值的矛盾的特点，以及解决这种矛盾的方针和办法，等等。
    这个问题，早几年我国经济学界就有人提出过，但还没有进行理论上的系统的分析。虽然它的提出曾经被人讥为“自然经济论”，但是社会主义政治经济学应当重视这个问题这一点已经越来越看得清楚。党的社会主义建设总路线，实际上也是从一个重要的角度提出进行这种研究的必要性。目前，实际生活更是突出地把这个问题推到政治经济学研究的日程上来了。
    社会主义国家对国民经济进行计划领导，当然要考虑到商品或产品的价值和使用价值两方面，而不是只考虑使用价值一方面。国家计划生产，不仅用实物指标，也用价格指标。不断降低所生产的商品或产品的价值，并在这个基础上降低价格，对于保证满足社会需要有很大的意义。在社会主义经济中，价值和使用价值的矛盾是经常发生的，特别当产品因为质量低劣、不合需要而造成积压、滞销的时候，或者当企业为了追逐生产获利多的产品而致完不成产品的品种计划和质量计划的时候，价值和使用价值之间的矛盾就会突出起来。这里，首先存在着一个生产的出发点的问题。
    社会主义的商品生产，以及一切需要利用价值形式的产品的生产，究竟是从生产具有各种使用价值的产品以满足社会各方面需要这一点出发呢，还是从交换、从价值出发呢？这个出发点的问题是一个极大的原则问题。只有把出发点弄对了，价值和使用价值的矛盾才能解决得好。
    有的同志认为，全民所有制经济内部互相“交换”的产品，从整个国家来看，是为满足国家和人民的需要而被生产出来，它们生产的是使用价值；但从各个企业的角度看，这些产品只是被当作价值生产出来，因为本企业并不使用它们。必须指出，这种割裂国家和企业看问题的方法（从国家角度看是使用价值，从企业角度看是价值）是不正确的，似是而非的。这实际上仍然是用对待私有制社会商品的观点来对待社会主义全民所有制经济内部互相“交换”的产品。这样就势必把企业生产的出发点摆错了。
    我们拿木材的生产做个例子吧。木材是国家生产建设和人民群众生产、生活中不可缺少的重要物质资料。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，各方面对这种物质资料的需要量愈来愈大。各国营森林企业从事木材生产、扩大木材生产，正是从这一点出发的。各企业经营木材，决不是从为交换其他产品、从获得利润出发的，尽管这种经营广泛地运用价值的形式，不仅分配给民用部门要实行等价交换，就是分配给其他国营部门也要通过核算取得等价补偿。实行等价交换、等价补偿和获得必要的赢利，这是社会主义生产的条件，但不是社会主义生产的目的。
    各森林企业生产木材，如果只懂得它们是为交换而生产，即仅仅当作价值而被生产出来，而不从使用价值方面去注意它们是否能满足社会各方面的需要，就会迷失方向，造成各种浪费。例如在木材生产中，如果从单纯交换观点看问题，那末，生产大规格的木材是有利的，无论在组织生产上，在运输上，在获得赢利上，都是如此。在目前条件下，小规格木材生产所花费的劳动，要比大规格木材生产所花费的劳动大得多，而且运输上有许多问题，势必增加成本，所以看起来有些不合算。但是，社会的需要是多种多样的，既需要大规格木材，也需要小规格木材。农业、轻工业、手工业生产以及人民群众的日常生活用品，需要大量的小规格木材。如果不解决这个问题，不仅不利于整个社会主义生产，而且在木材生产上还会出现另一方面的问题，这就是不能充分利用森林资源，不能提高森林的单位面积出材量，并出现大材小用、浪费木材的现象。
    这里暴露出价值和使用价值的一个矛盾。需要按照社会主义的原则来解决这个矛盾。
    我们的生产，应当首先从社会需要来考虑。但是，从社会需要出发，是否可以忽视价值方面的问题呢？当然不能够。为了增产小规格木材，有关部门除了应当将森林企业的小规格木材纳入生产计划、确定小规格木材的生产任务，并在下达木材生产计划时尽可能分别规定大规格木材和小规格木材的产量指标、质量要求以外，重要的一个方面，就是按照木材规格之大小及生产费用之多少，适当调整木材的出厂价格。销售价格也要有所调整。在赢利上适当地实行“以大补小”。同时，应当根据大小规格木材生产的不同效率，来分别制定工资定额，贯彻按劳取酬原则，以促进工人对生产小规格木材的积极性。
    社会主义经济运动中充满了象这一类的矛盾。很显然的，我们不能忘掉出发点而让价值和价值规律牵着鼻子走。
    那末，价值和价值规律在社会主义生产中究竟占何种地位呢？这是一个老问题了，但在新的情况下也不妨重新提一下。
    价值这个经济范畴，在社会主义制度下仍被广泛运用，不仅运用于商品生产，而且运用于非商品生产。由于社会再生产过程的统一性，社会主义社会既然不能废除商品生产，因此，不仅一部分进行商品交换的产品具有价值，另一部分并不和别的产品进行商品交换的产品，如国营企业生产的主要生产资料，也运用价值及其各种形式来计算消耗的劳动量，把具体劳动转化为抽象劳动，以进行劳动的价值核算。这在社会还不能直接用劳动时间来衡量为生产某一产品所耗费的劳动量以前，是不可避免的。所以价值在社会主义制度下既是交换的基础，又是劳动的尺度和消费的尺度，其重要性是可以想见的。
    价值规律所揭露的，无非是产品的价值量要由生产这个产品时所消耗的社会必要劳动量来决定。这个规律在社会主义社会为生产的计划领导提供一个方面的依据。
    有人说：在社会主义制度下，价值连同它的各种形式（价格、货币等）以及价值规律，都只能是属于资本主义的，是资本主义经济范畴和规律。看不出这种说法有多少根据。这是一个需要加以讨论的问题。但是，确实地，凡是价值和价值规律起作用的地方，往往是资本主义因素易于滋长和活动的地方。事实指明，这是社会主义生产中一个充满着斗争的地带。
    当我们进入价值和价值规律活动的地带，如果不能采取自觉的态度，其结果往往模糊社会主义生产的目的。举例说，社会主义生产，是为了生产出更多更好的具有各种使用价值的产品，但有时用价值形式综合地标明生产情况，具体劳动转化为抽象劳动，却使使用价值本身被掩盖起来了。在这种情况下，如果单凭价值的情况，例如单凭价格指标完成的情况来判断一个企业的活动，而不问其在使用价值上是否完成生产任务，那就有一切可能把企业引入歧途。
    社会主义对于企业的计划领导，首先要求企业完成一定的品种和产品数量计划，并且要求产品符合一定的质量要求。这就是首先在实物形态上，在使用价值上，完成国家的生产计划。同时，也要求完成产值（价格）、成本、利润等方面的计划。如果不首先着重于要求前者，或者借口扩大企业的主动权而竟至放弃在实物形态上、使用价值上的要求，使企业片面追求在产值上即价格指标上完成任务，甚至把利润当作中心的指标，那就是远远地离开了社会主义生产的目的。而价格指标、利润等是完全能够在违背社会主义生产目的和主要生产任务的情况下，用各种不正当手段（例如改变生产品种、忽视产品质量、进行市场投机、改变原料的利用方法、忽视固定资产的修理，等等）猎取的。这就是促使企业走上资本主义自由竞争的道路。修正主义者正是这样干的。
    我们都知道，价值和价值规律在资本主义以前的社会形态存在过，在资本主义社会存在过，现在在社会主义社会也存在着，它对这些社会的生产都起作用，对发展资本主义生产起过很大的作用，但都不决定各该社会生产的实质及基础。在资本主义以前的社会形态，尽管价值规律是一种自发的力量，尽管价值规律的作用在商品生产的一定阶段会促进某些资本主义因素的生长，但仅是价值和价值规律本身，并不能直接引导到资本主义。只有在其他必要条件（生产资料私有制、劳动力作为商品出现在市场上、并从而出现雇佣劳动制度等）的配合下，价值和价值规律的活动才会引导到资本主义。
    社会主义社会一般说排除了上述这些条件。社会主义国家在组织计划生产时把价值作为重要的工具之一。这时候，价值规律一般不再成为统治人们的力量。但是，社会主义社会是从资本主义社会中产生出来的，它在各个方面还保留着资本主义的残迹；盲目的、不受国家计划领导的力量和因素仍然到处存在着；过去曾有过广阔作用范围的价值规律的自发作用，也在现实经济生活中和人们的意识中留下了极深刻的影响，形成了一种顽固的习惯势力。
    社会主义社会的这些消极因素、力量，由于价值和价值规律继续在一定范围内起作用，而不容易被彻底肃清，它们往往在这里找到最好的“防空洞”，找到寄生的场所，并且易于展开活动；另一方面，社会主义社会中价值和价值规律的活动如果同这些力量、因素、势力结合起来，也就容易使其原有的仅仅被约束了的自发性获得解放，而成为一种同社会主义生产的目的和有计划发展规律正相反对的东西。
    在社会主义社会，代表资本主义的势力，在经济领域内的活动，往往首先就是拼命企图释放价值和价值规律的自发力量，撤销一切限制，把价值提到经济生活的首位，以利润作为企业经营管理的主要指标，并由此引出平均利润率以至变相的雇佣劳动等类东西，为资本主义的复辟打开经济上的通路。
    从上所说不难看出，政治经济学对于社会主义经济运动的研究，面临着种种复杂的情况。我们说，价值和价值规律是一个“伟大的学校”，这主要的是指：（一）真正的社会主义生产领导者，必须学会运用价值来作为正确计算劳动消耗和节约劳动的工具，懂得如何实行经济核算，发掘潜力，根据长远利益和眼前利益相结合的原则合理制定价格，促进生产的发展，等等。
  （二）在这个领域中，充满着社会主义和资本主义、计划性和自发性两种势力的较量。必须学会把价值的作用约束在社会主义所许可的范围。必须学会同一切资本主义因素、力量和自发势力作斗争，并且有本领战胜它们。
    能不能够认为这是价值和价值规律本身的过错，因而必须宣布它们是资本主义性质的呢？看来无此必要，即使存在着上面所说的情况。这样对待问题实际上是过于简单化了的。问题在于把价值放到恰当的地位和一定的范围，而不忘掉社会主义生产（包括其中的商品生产）的目的是满足社会需要。社会主义社会的商品不是仅仅当作价值生产出来，尤其不能把价值作为一种掩盖使用价值的迷雾，在这种迷雾之下什么事情都可能发生。价值是工具而不是目的。这个工具如果运用得当，驾驭得好，就能造福于社会主义；如果运用不当，无力驾驭，或者甚至把作为工具的东西错误地当作目的本身，那当然会引起各种严重后果，直至（在其他条件的配合下）引导到资本主义。
    归结起来说一句：政治经济学对于社会主义经济运动的研究，不能脱离开满足社会需要这个基本点、中心点，不能把着重点放在价值上而不放在使用价值上。由于社会主义生产的复杂性，从生产到消费的道路的迂回曲折，并须运用许多经济杠杆，逼使我们在分析各种具体问题时不能不时常回到上面所说的基本观点上来，目前有些问题的讨论也表明这样做是必要的。——以上意见，谨求正于经济学界同志。
