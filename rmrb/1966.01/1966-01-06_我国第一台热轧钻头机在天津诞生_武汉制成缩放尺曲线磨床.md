    △ China's first hot rolling drill bit machine has been successfully trial-produced at the Tianjin Tool Factory.
    This hot rolling drill bit machine is composed of two parts: a high-frequency electric furnace and a rolling mill. Trial production shows that the rolled drill bits fully meet the quality requirements.
    Using the hot rolling method to produce drill bits is a new technology that has only developed in the world in recent years. The successful creation of the hot rolling drill bit machine by the workers of the Tianjin Tool Factory marks a major step forward in China's technology for producing drill bits.
    The hot rolling drill bit machine is used to manufacture the twist drill bits, which are the most commonly used tools in mechanical industrial production. In the past, the production of twist drill bits generally used cutting methods, requiring turning and milling one cut at a time, which was both labor-intensive and material-consuming. Now, with the hot rolling drill bit machine, using non-cutting methods, the steel used to make drill bits is heated to a certain temperature in the electric furnace by simply pressing a button during production, and then sent to the rolling mill to automatically extrude into twist drill bits.
    Compared with the old cutting methods, the new hot rolling technology increases production efficiency by 20 times, saves about one-third of the steel, extends the service life of the drill bit by about four times, and also saves more than a dozen machine tools and corresponding manpower.
    The hot rolling drill bit machine is the product of the Tianjin Tool Factory workers breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and daring to create. As early as two years ago, the workers of this factory heard that foreign countries had new hot rolling drill bit technology, but they could not find any technical reference materials. The lack of technical reference materials did not stump them. They overcame numerous difficulties, carried out more than 400 experiments, and made 19 modifications before finally creating China's first hot rolling drill bit machine. After making the hot rolling drill bit machine, the workers of the Tianjin Tool Factory also made supporting equipment such as cutting and grinding machines and chamfering machines, creating conditions for the mass production of hot rolled drill bits.
    △ The Wuhan Machine Tool Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a reducing and enlarging scale curve grinding machine, providing a precision equipment for grinding tools in China's instrument industry.
    The reducing and enlarging scale curve grinding machine can grind many kinds of special-shaped tools, as well as various irregular molds and workpieces of various shapes. Compared with the optical curve grinding machines widely used in China's instrument industry, the reducing and enlarging scale curve grinding machine has the characteristics of light weight, wide processing range, simple operation, and high processing accuracy.

### 我国第一台热轧钻头机在天津诞生  武汉制成缩放尺曲线磨床

    我国第一台热轧钻头机在天津诞生
    武汉制成缩放尺曲线磨床
    △我国第一台热轧钻头机已在天津市工具厂试制成功。
    这台热轧钻头机是由高频电炉和轧机两个部分组成的。试生产表明，轧制出的钻头完全合乎质量要求。
    用热轧方法生产钻头，在世界上还是近几年发展起来的一项新技术。天津市工具厂职工创制成功热轧钻头机，标志着我国生产钻头的技术又前进了一大步。
    热轧钻头机，是用来制造机械工业生产中最常用的工具麻花钻头的。过去，生产麻花钻头，一般使用的是切削加工方法，要一刀一刀地车铣，既费工时又费材料。现在用热轧钻头机，使用无切削加工方法，生产时只要按动电钮，在电炉内把用来制造钻头的钢材加热到一定温度，然后送进轧机就能自动挤轧成麻花钻头。
    使用这种新的热轧技术同旧的切削方法比较，生产效率提高二十倍，节约钢材三分之一左右，钻头使用寿命可延长四倍左右，而且还可以节省下十几台机床和相应的人力。
    热轧钻头机是天津市工具厂职工破除迷信，解放思想，大胆创造的产物。早在两年之前，这个厂职工就听说外国有热轧钻头的新技术，但是，找不到一份技术参考资料。没有技术参考资料并没有难住他们。他们克服了重重的困难，先后进行了四百多次试验，并且作了十九次修改，最后终于制成了我国第一台热轧钻头机。在制成热轧钻头机之后，天津工具厂工人又制成了切头磨尖机、倒角机等配套设备，为大量生产热轧钻头创造了条件。
    △武汉机床厂最近试制成功缩放尺曲线磨床，为我国仪表工业磨削刀具提供了一种精密设备。
    缩放尺曲线磨床能磨削许多种异形刀具，也能磨削各种不规则模具和各种形状的工件。同目前我国仪表工业广泛使用的光学曲线磨床相比，缩放尺曲线磨床具有重量轻、加工范围广、操作简便、加工精度高等特点。
