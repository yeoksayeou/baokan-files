    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Sato government, following the will of the United States, is stepping up the implementation of the Third Military Expansion Plan, aimed at outward expansion and aggression, and at intensifying the suppression of the people domestically.
    The Japanese "Defense Agency" (equivalent to the Ministry of Defense) drafted the so-called "Third Defense Plan" at the end of 1965.
    This military expansion plan emphasizes expanding the so-called "Self-Defense Forces" and increasing military equipment such as missiles. This five-year military expansion plan, originally scheduled to be implemented from 1967 to 1971, has been determined to be implemented ahead of schedule, starting in April 1966.
    According to a recent report by the Japanese Communist Party's newspaper *Akahata*, this plan stipulates the replacement of the Nike-Ajax missiles currently being deployed in Tokyo and Fukuoka with Hercules missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Three Hercules missile battalions have recently been stationed in central and southern Hokkaido, as well as in the Osaka, Kobe, and Nagoya areas. In addition, four Hawk missile battalions will be stationed in the North Kyushu region and other areas.
    The plan also stipulates that the Ground "Self-Defense Force" will be increased from the current 145,000 to 180,000 men. An air transport unit for counter-guerrilla warfare, equipped with large helicopters, will be established. Japanese-made 35-ton tanks will replace the old-fashioned American tanks. At the same time, military equipment will be replenished and ammunition reserves will be increased.
    The Maritime "Self-Defense Force" will build nine new submarines and escort ships. The newly built escort ships will be able to accommodate helicopters with unmanned attack submarines.
    The Air "Self-Defense Force" will increase F-104 fighters and transport aircraft to strengthen the US-Japan joint military operation system.
    The plan also stipulates strengthening the combat effectiveness of ground divisions and establishing chemical warfare corps. In addition, recruitment activities will be stepped up to greatly increase the reserve forces of the "Self-Defense Forces."

    佐藤政府正加速推行扩军计划
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本佐藤政府正在按照美国的意旨，加紧推行以向外扩张侵略、对内加紧镇压人民为目标的第三次扩军计划。
    日本“防卫厅”（相当于国防局）一九六五年底拟订了所谓“第三个防务计划”。
    这个扩军计划强调要扩大叫做“自卫队”的军队，增加导弹等军备。这个原定于一九六七年至一九七一年执行的五年扩军计划，已确定提前从一九六六年四月开始执行。
    据日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》最近报道，这个计划规定用能够装核弹头的赫尔克里士式导弹，代替目前正在东京和福冈设置的奈克—阿贾克斯式导弹。最近在北海道中部和南部及大阪、神户、名古屋一带派驻三个赫尔克里士式导弹大队。另外，在北九州等地区派驻四个隼式导弹大队。
    计划还规定，把陆上“自卫队”从现有的十四万五千人增加到十八万人。成立配备大型直升飞机的反游击战空运部队。用日本制造的三十五吨坦克代替美国的旧式坦克。同时还补充军事装备和增加弹药的储备。
    海上“自卫队”将新造九艘潜水艇和护航舰。新造的护航舰要能停放无人驾驶的攻击潜水艇的直升飞机。
    空中“自卫队”将增加F—104型战斗机和运输机，以加强美日联合军事行动体系。
    这个计划还规定增强地面师的战斗力，并且成立化学战兵团。此外还要加紧征兵活动，以大大增加“自卫队”的后备力量。
