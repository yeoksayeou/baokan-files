    The Thai people are struggling against U.S. imperialism and the traitorous, dictatorial government of Thailand. Currently, armed struggles are constantly expanding in some provinces in northeastern, central, and southern Thailand.

    Because U.S. imperialism has turned Thailand into its new type of colony and an aggressive military base, and because the Thai reactionary government has adopted policies of selling out national interests and cruelly oppressing and exploiting the people, the Thai people have been continuously carrying out various forms of struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary government for many years. The establishment of the Patriotic Front of Thailand on January 1, 1965, formed the center for the unity of Thailand's patriotic forces, further promoting the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of the Thai people.

    As early as 1961, activities of people's armed resistance against the reactionary government's armed suppression appeared successively in northeastern and southern Thailand. Last August, the Thanom dictatorial regime dispatched a large number of armed police to bloodily suppress the people's struggles in Nakhon Phanom, Nong Khai, and Ubon Ratchathani provinces in the northeast, arousing strong and widespread opposition and resentment from the Thai people. The armed struggle against suppression and persecution has continued to expand, and has now extended to the central region.

    According to high-ranking officials of the Thai reactionary government, the activities of the people's armed forces in the northeast are "the most serious," and base areas have been established in some areas of Nakhon Phanom, Sakon Nakhon, Ubon Ratchathani, Udon Thani, and Surin provinces. Some reports in Thai newspapers and Western news agencies say that the Thai people's armed forces are constantly growing stronger and often give the reactionary army and police powerful blows. For example, on December 29 last year, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Phanom Province repelled the attack of 800 reactionary troops and police. Reuters reported on January 16 this year that in Sakon Nakhon Province, the people's armed forces are very active, so that the reactionary military and political officials there are "trembling with fear when eating and sleeping," and "they feel that they are surrounded by invisible enemies."

    The Thai people's armed struggle has made the reactionary ruling clique extremely panicked. Thai Prime Minister Thanom has repeatedly expressed his "deep concern" about the development of the people's armed struggle. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Praphat once exclaimed that the people's armed activities have developed to "only sixty miles from the capital Bangkok in the central region of Thailand," and that the situation faced by the reactionary government "is very serious." Thai Deputy Minister of Defense Thawi said on January 5 this year that the situation in northeastern Thailand is very similar to the situation in South Vietnam about six years ago. U.S. imperialism is also greatly disturbed, and many U.S. officials and newspapers are constantly clamoring that Thailand will face a "dangerous situation."

    In order to vainly try to extinguish the flames of the Thai people's armed struggle, the Thai reactionary authorities, with the massive military and economic "aid" of U.S. imperialism, are intensifying suppression activities. The United States is helping the Thai reactionary government to greatly expand its army and police. Not long ago, Thailand also established a "special force" specifically to suppress guerrilla activities, and sent it to the border areas to conduct "sweeps." The Thai reactionary authorities have also taken various other measures to suppress the people's patriotic struggles throughout the country.

    However, no matter how desperately U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities carry out bloody suppression, they will never be able to stop the development of the Thai people's struggle. Thai Deputy Minister of Interior Thain once lamented that the reactionary government felt it was very difficult to conduct "sweeps" against the guerrillas, and that mobilizing a large number of police to engage in "searches" always yielded no results. He admitted that the guerrillas had the support of the people, saying that the authorities had never been able to obtain information about the guerrillas' activities from the residents. When Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman talked about the people's armed struggle last December, he had to say with concern: "Underground fire is more dangerous than external disasters, and a single spark can start a prairie fire." Indeed, the sparks of armed struggle lit by the Thai people will surely burn brighter and brighter in the struggle, and finally form a prairie fire.

### 泰国人民的武装斗争正在发展中

    泰国人民的武装斗争正在发展中
    泰国人民正在为反对美帝国主义和泰国卖国独裁政府而进行斗争。目前，在泰国东北部、中部和南部的一些府，武装斗争正在不断扩展中。
    由于美帝国主义把泰国当成它的新型殖民地和侵略性的军事基地，由于泰国反动政府采取了出卖民族利益和残酷地压迫、剥削人民的政策，多年以来，泰国人民一直不断地向美帝国主义和泰国反动政府进行着各种形式的斗争。一九六五年一月一日泰国爱国阵线的成立，形成了泰国爱国力量团结的中心，使泰国人民的反帝爱国斗争进一步高涨。
    早从一九六一年开始，泰国东北部和南部相继出现了人民武装起来反对反动政府武装镇压的活动。去年八月他侬独裁政权派遣大批武装警察血腥镇压东北部的那空拍侬、廊开和乌汶府等地人民的斗争，激起了泰国人民的强烈和广泛的反对和愤恨。反镇压反迫害的武装斗争不断扩展，目前已扩大到中部地区。
    据泰国反动政府的高级官员透露，东北部的人民武装力量的活动“最为严重”，在那空拍侬、沙空那空、乌汶、乌隆、素辇等府的一些地区都已建立了根据地。泰国报纸和西方通讯社的一些报道说：泰国人民武装力量不断发展壮大，经常给反动军队和警察以有力的打击。如去年十二月二十九日，那空拍侬府人民武装就曾击退了八百名反动军警的进攻。路透社在今年一月十六日报道说：在沙空那空府，人民武装非常活跃，以致在那里的反动军政官员“吃饭睡觉都是胆战心惊”，“他们感到，他们是处于看不见的敌人的包围之中”。
    泰国人民的武装斗争使反动统治集团感到万分惊慌。泰国总理他侬曾一再表示对人民武装斗争的发展“甚为担忧”。泰国副总理兼内政部长巴博曾经惊呼：人民武装活动已发展到离首都曼谷“只有六十英里的泰国中部地区”，反动政府面临的局势“是十分严重”的。泰国国防部副部长他威今年一月五日说，泰国东北部局势酷似大约六年前的南越局势。美帝国主义也大为不安，美国的不少官员和报纸不断叫嚷泰国将会出现“危险的局面”。
    为了妄想扑灭泰国人民的武装斗争烈火，泰国反动当局在美帝国主义的大量军事和经济“援助”下，加紧镇压活动。美国帮助泰国反动政府大量扩充军队和警察。不久前，泰国还成立了一支专门镇压游击队活动的“特种部队”，派到边境地区进行“扫荡”。泰国反动当局还采取其他各种办法，在全国各地镇压人民的爱国斗争。
    但是，不管美帝国主义和泰国反动当局怎样穷凶极恶地进行血腥镇压，也决阻挡不了泰国人民斗争的发展。泰国内政部副部长他因曾经哀叹，反动政府对游击队进行“扫荡”时甚感困难，调动大批警察从事“搜剿”总是毫无结果。他承认游击队得到了人民的支持，说是当局一直不能从居民那里获得有关游击队活动的情报。泰国外交部长科曼在去年十二月谈起人民武装斗争时也不得不忧心忡忡地说：“地下火比外来的灾害更加危险，星星之火是可以燎原的。”的确，泰国人民点起的武装斗争的星星之火，一定能够在斗争中越烧越旺，最后形成燎原之势。
