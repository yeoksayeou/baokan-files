    We are now managing Well No. 18, which used to be a complex well, often malfunctioning and relatively difficult to manage.

    Knowing There are Tigers on the Mountain, We Head for the Tiger Mountain

    In November 1964, the leadership assigned Well No. 18 to our team and then to our women's well group. This caused quite a stir. Many people were worried about not managing it well.

    From the moment we took over the well, the instructor continuously did ideological work. Together, we analyzed the "four fears" in some comrades in the well group: First, fear of the oil well stopping production and having a field meeting; second, fear of an accident in the oil well affecting the team's collective honor and not being able to take responsibility; third, fear of not achieving first-class status in the post responsibility system inspection and being criticized; fourth, fear of not being able to crank the winch and being laughed at. The instructor told us that we must organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's works carefully after returning. Through study and discussion, we raised our ideological understanding, compared ourselves to Zhang Side, and found significant gaps. The more we found, the more we felt we were wrong. The well leader said, "We should 'know there are tigers on the mountain, and head for the tiger mountain' when doing revolutionary work, without fear of hardships. If we start from 'self' in everything, we will find difficulties in every action." I continued, "That's right. If you are afraid of difficulties, you won't manage the well well. If you want to manage the well well, you must not be afraid of difficulties. Difficulties are obstacles in our progress. We must face difficulties and fight tigers, eliminate them, and conquer them. Then, difficulties at work will become not difficult." Through studying Chairman Mao's works, everyone's enthusiasm rose. Everyone realized that to manage the well well, we must straighten out our thinking and correct our attitude. With a "fearful" attitude, this well would never be turned around.

    After everyone's thinking was enlightened, we then used the method of "dividing one into two" to analyze the well specifically. Through discussion, we found four favorable conditions: First, the well is in its prime, with a large amount of crude oil still hidden underground, and it has great potential in the future; second, the underground situation is relatively good; third, after vigorously implementing stratified water injection, the injected water volume in the medium and low permeability layers has been strengthened, and we will see results in the future; fourth, the production is relatively high. After this analysis, everyone was pleasantly surprised to realize: Really! Our well has so many favorable conditions. We found advantages in disadvantages and saw light in the face of difficulties, and everyone's revolutionary drive was aroused.

    Grasping the Principal Contradiction

    How to do it, what to do first, opinions were not unified, each with its own reasons. At this time, we reviewed "On Contradiction" and, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, decided to find the principal contradiction of this well. The sons and daughters of China have many lofty aspirations, and we must establish this lofty aspiration and conquer this complex well. After everyone's discussion and analysis, it was considered that the difficulty in cleaning paraffin was a major contradiction. If this problem is solved, the risk of the oil well stopping production will be reduced, and other problems will be solved easily. If primary and secondary are not distinguished, everything is important, then nothing is important. Trying to grasp everything at once results in grasping nothing. Managing the well is the same. This well is difficult to clean paraffin from, and we had heard long ago that it was caused by severe wax deposition, so we must first solve the wax deposition problem. But why is the wax deposition severe? To find out the reason, we went to the mining area three times after work, the geological team six times, and Well No. 18 more than eighty times, collecting a large amount of data and conducting detailed analysis.

    Exploring Laws Through Practice

    From the analysis of the situation, the reason for not cleaning the paraffin thoroughly is that there is too much dead oil in the wellbore, not severe wax deposition. However, at that time, none of us dared to draw a conclusion. I thought, for four years, the experienced masters have always said that it was caused by severe wax deposition, and we are suddenly saying that there is too much dead oil. Is that right? Regarding this uncertain problem, we re-organized the data and repeatedly analyzed it three times. The conclusion of the analysis was still due to too much dead oil. At this time, I remembered that every time after cleaning the paraffin, when we lifted it up for inspection, there was a very long "wax stick" on the paraffin scraper, but when we lowered it down, there was no wax at all, only sticky heavy oil. Other comrades had the same feeling. The analysis and practice matched, so we made up our minds to test our views through practice again. Finally, we came to the correct conclusion: Too much dead oil in the wellbore is the main problem directly affecting paraffin cleaning.

    What method should be used to discharge the dead oil? We explored it carefully again. We found that the sound of oil production was loud when measuring gas, and we thought this was a clue. Because when measuring gas, the separator pressure drops to zero, and the resistance of the oil from the wellbore to the separator is greatly reduced, allowing some dead oil to escape. In this way, we found a measure to reduce separation pressure, reduce resistance, increase flow rate, and discharge dead oil. However, how long should the pressure be reduced each time? We didn't know. We increased it gradually in increments of five minutes, ten minutes, little by little, and experimented step by step. After testing, the pressure reduction time was set at forty-five minutes. However, doing so brought another problem: reducing pressure and discharging oil more than ten times a day caused large fluctuations in oil and casing pressure. To solve this problem, we changed to recording oil pressure, casing pressure, oil production sound, and separator pressure every fifteen minutes, observed for a total of more than ninety hours, and recorded more than one thousand one hundred and forty data points to find the pattern: too many pressure reductions per day caused frequent agitation of the oil well, causing the oil and casing pressure to fluctuate up and down by three to four atmospheres, but too few pressure reductions failed to discharge the dead oil. The more appropriate method was to reduce the pressure three times a day, half an hour to an hour before paraffin cleaning. In this way, the oil and casing pressure fluctuation was only one to two atmospheres, and it only took two hours to clean the paraffin once.

    Cleaning the paraffin took two hours, which was still too long, so we took measures and finally achieved a paraffin lowering time of forty minutes, and the fastest was fifteen minutes.

    The paraffin cleaning problem was basically solved, but it was still difficult to produce oil without pressure reduction. Later, we proposed some technical measures to keep the oil production pipeline unobstructed and reduce resistance. The oil production and management of this well became relatively normal.

    As old contradictions are resolved, new ones emerge. According to general wells, opening the well for production after closing it to restore pressure should be better than before, but our well was abnormal. In March of last year, after closing the well to measure static pressure, the well was opened, but the oil production was worse than before. After our careful analysis, we found the reason, took measures, and solved the problem. Since then, the oil well production has been normal. Thanks to everyone's joint efforts, this well achieved first-class status in the post responsibility system and became a "Five-Good" oil well.

    Through the changes in this well, we realized that to manage the well well, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and to transform reality, we must grasp objective laws. An oil well is like a cow, and objective laws are the nose rope. Only by pulling the nose rope correctly can the cow be tamed and work have freedom. Doing revolution requires breaking frameworks, daring to think boldly, and daring to act boldly, which must be closely combined with the scientific spirit. At the same time, we deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is not only a sharp weapon for transforming the subjective world but also a sharp weapon for transforming the objective world.

    敢想敢闯同科学态度紧密结合  按照毛主席教导摸准客观规律
    大庆油田第一采油指挥部采油工　栾淑霞（女，二十岁）
    我们现在管的十八井，原来是口复杂井，常出毛病，比较难管。
    明知山有虎，偏往虎山行
    一九六四年十一月份，领导上把十八井分给了我们队，又给了我们女子井组。这一下引起了不少波动。不少人都是提心吊胆的，怕管不好。
    从接井的时候起，指导员就不断做思想工作。我们一起分析了井组部分同志有“四怕”的思想：一怕油井停喷，开现场会；二怕油井出了事故，影响队的集体荣誉，负不起责任；三怕岗位责任制检查达不到一类，受批评；四怕摇不动绞车，别人笑话。指导员告诉我们，回去以后一定要组织大家好好学习毛主席著作。我们通过学习讨论，提高了思想认识，对照张思德，大找差距，越找越感到我们错了。井长说：“我们干革命工作就要‘明知山有虎，偏往虎山行’，不怕千辛万苦。如果处处从‘我’字出发，抬手动脚就会觉得困难。”我接着说：“确实是这样，你要是怕困难就管不好井，想管好井就必须不怕困难。困难是我们前进当中的拦路虎，我们只有见困难就上，见虎就打，消灭它，战胜它，这样，工作上的难也就变成了不难。”通过学习毛主席著作，大家的情绪高涨了。一致认识到：要想管好井，必须思想搞通，态度端正。采取“怕”的态度，这口井就一辈子也翻不过身来。
    大家的思想开窍以后，接着，我们又用两分法对这口井进行了具体分析。通过讨论，找到了四个有利条件：一是这口井正是年轻力壮时期，地下还藏着大量的原油，今后还大有作为；二是地下情况比较好；三是大搞分层配注以后，加强了中、低渗透层的注入水量，今后会见到效果；四是产量比较高。这样一分析，大家都惊喜地感到：真的！我们井还有这么多的有利条件。我们从不利中找到了有利，在困难面前看到了光明，大家的革命干劲就起来了。
    抓住主要矛盾
    怎么干，究竟先搞什么，意见不统一，各有各的理。这时，我们重温了《矛盾论》，并根据毛主席的教导，决定找出这口井的主要矛盾。中华儿女多奇志，我们就要立这个奇志，非要征服这口复杂井不可。经过大家讨论分析，认为这口井不好清蜡是个主要矛盾。这个问题解决了，油井停喷的危险性就少了，其它问题也就迎刃而解。如果主次不分，什么都是主要的，反过来就都不主要。一手都想抓起来，反倒什么也没有抓到手。管井也是同样。这口井清蜡不好清，我们很早就听说是结蜡严重造成的，必须先解决结蜡问题。可是为什么结蜡严重呢？为了摸清原因，我们在下班后，三次到矿场，六次到地质大队，先后八十多次到十八井，收集了大量资料，进行了细致的整理分析。
    通过实践，摸索规律
    从分析情况来看，清蜡清不净是因为井筒里死油多，而不是结蜡严重。可是，当时我们谁也不敢下结论。我想，四年来，老师傅一直说是结蜡严重造成的，我们一下子说是死油多，对不对呢？针对这个没有把握的难题，我们又重新整理了资料，反复分析了三次，分析的结论还是由于死油多。这时，我想起，每次清完蜡，起上来检查的时候，刮蜡片上都有很长一段“蜡棒子”，可是往下打蜡的时候，一片蜡都没有，全是粘乎乎的稠油。其他同志同样有这个感觉。分析与实践对上了口，我们就下了决心，再通过实践来检验我们的看法。最后终于得出了正确的结论：井筒死油多，是直接影响清蜡的主要问题。
    用什么办法排出死油呢？我们又认真摸索。发现测气时，出油声音大，我们认为这是个门路。因为测气时分离器压力降到零，油从井筒喷出地面后，再进入分离器的阻力大大减小了，死油就借此机会跑出来一些。这样，我们就找到了通过降低分压，减少阻力，增加流速，排出死油的措施。可是，一次降压多长时间呢？不知道。我们就五分钟、十分钟、一点一点地增加，一步一步地试验。经过试验，把降压时间定为四十五分钟。但是，这样做，问题又来了，一天降压排油十多次，油套压力波动很大。为了解决这个问题，我们又改为十五分钟记录一次油压、套压、出油声音、分离器压力，一共进行了九十多个小时的观察，记录了一千一百四十多个数据，才摸到了规律：每天降压次数过多，油井激动频繁，使油套压力上下波动三至四个大气压，但降压次数少，死油又排不出去。比较恰当的是，每天降压三次，在清蜡前半小时到一小时之间。这样，油套压力波动只有一至二个大气压，油井清一次蜡只需要两个小时。
    清蜡要两个小时，时间还长，我们又采取了办法，最后达到了清一次蜡，下入时间四十分钟，最快十五分钟。
    清蜡问题基本解决了，可是平时不降压，出油还有困难。以后，我们又提出了一些技术措施，使出油管线畅通，减少阻力。这口井出油和管理就比较正常了。
    旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现了。按一般井来说，关井恢复压力后，开井生产应该比以前好，而我们的井却反常。去年三月份，关井测静压后，井虽打开了，可是出油比以前差了。经过我们认真分析，找到了原因，采取了办法，解决了问题。从此油井生产正常了。由于大伙的共同努力，使这口井岗位责任制达到了一类，并且实现了五好油井。
    通过这口井的变化，使我们认识到，要想管好井，必须按照毛主席的教导，要变革现实，就要摸准客观规律，油井好比牛，客观规律是牛鼻子，只有牵准牛鼻子走，牛才会被制服，工作才会有自由；干革命就要打破框框，敢大胆地想，大胆地闯，一定要与科学精神紧密结合。同时，我们深深体会到，毛泽东思想不仅是改造主观世界的锐利武器，也是改造客观世界的锐利武器。
