    Continuously Revolutionize, Forever Advance
    Taiping Brigade Prepares with Both Hands
    Lu He, Party Branch Secretary of the Taiping Brigade in the Zhongxing Commune, Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province – our nation's northernmost Dazhai-style agricultural model – analyzed the local production conditions. He started from the worst-case scenario and actively made two-pronged preparations for this year's production. They prepared for drought prevention and also arranged measures to deal with spring flooding. They also prepared two sets of seeds. If there is a spring drought, they will plant more warm-loving and drought-resistant corn, millet, and sorghum; if there is spring flooding, they will plant more moisture-loving and cold-resistant soybeans. In any case, they must strive for timely and early planting to win a bumper harvest in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.
  Xiadingjia Brigade Rouses Even Greater Enthusiasm
    After overcoming a major drought and reaping a bumper harvest last year, the Xiadingjia Brigade in Huang County, Shandong Province, with the spirit of "finding shortcomings after winning battles" and taking Dazhai as an example, looked for gaps and saw shortcomings. Everyone believed that they had three major gaps compared to Dazhai: First, stable and high yields were not as solid as Dazhai's. Second, ideological and political work was not as deep, meticulous, and thorough as Dazhai's. Third, contributions to the country were not as great as Dazhai's.
    Having identified the gaps, the people of Xiadingjia are even more determined to move forward. Wang Yongxing, Secretary of the Party General Branch, said: "We hope that brother teams will surpass us, and the more the better; at the same time, we must use the spirit of the General Line to go all out, aim high, and strive for the upstream, to be worthy of the Party and worthy of Chairman Mao."
    Songlin Commune Searches Widely for Gaps
    After being praised as a Dazhai-style model in Yunnan Province, the Songlin Commune in Xuanwei, Yunnan Province, continued to learn from advanced experiences. They said that although they had made great achievements in production and construction over the past decade, there was still a large gap compared to Dazhai. Taking farmland capital construction as an example, their terraced fields were not yet flat, with some high and some low, and poor water and fertilizer retention; many fields were often subject to flood and waterlogging, or were uneven with shallow soil layers and needed soil improvement; and there were more than 1,000 mu of sloping land to be converted into terraced fields. In response to these weaknesses, they launched an effort to take the people of Dazhai as an example, demand of themselves a high standard, redouble their efforts to carry out farmland capital construction, and create good conditions for achieving even greater production increases this year.

    不断革命  永远前进
    太平大队准备两手
    我国最北部的大寨式农业典型—黑龙江甘南县中兴公社太平大队党支部书记吕和，分析了当地各种生产条件，从最坏处着眼，积极为今年的生产做好两手准备。他们做好防旱准备，也安排了对付春涝的办法。他们还准备了两套种子，遇到春旱就多种喜温耐旱的玉米、谷子、高粱；春涝就多种喜湿耐寒的大豆。不管怎样，一定要争取适时早播，争取第三个五年计划的头一年获得丰收。
  下丁家大队再鼓干劲
    山东黄县下丁家大队，在战胜大旱夺取去年大丰收以后，又以“打了胜仗找缺点”的精神，以大寨为榜样，找差距、看缺点。大家认为自己与大寨相比有三大差距：一、稳产高产不如大寨过硬。二、思想政治工作不如大寨抓得深、细、透。三、对国家贡献不如大寨多。
    找出差距，下丁家人不断前进的决心更大了。党总支书记王永幸说：“我们希望兄弟队超过我们，并且越多越好；我们同时也要以总路线精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，才对得起党，对得起毛主席。”
    松林公社大找差距
    云南宣威松林公社被誉为云南省大寨式典型以后，继续学习先进经验。他们说，十年来，我们在生产建设上取得很大成绩，但与大寨相比还有很大差距。就以农田基本建设来说，我们的梯田还不平坦，上高下低，保水保肥力差；有不少地常常受洪涝灾害，或是不平整，土层浅，需要改良土壤；还有一千多亩坡地要改梯地。针对这些薄弱环节，他们开展了以大寨人为榜样，用高标准要求自己，再接再厉进行农田基本建设，为争取今年更大增产创造良好条件。
