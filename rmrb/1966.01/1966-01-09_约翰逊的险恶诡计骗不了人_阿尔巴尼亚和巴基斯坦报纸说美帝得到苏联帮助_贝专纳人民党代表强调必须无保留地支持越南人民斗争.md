    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 7th. The Albanian newspaper *Zëri i Popullit* published a commentary on the 7th, pointing out that the recent clamoring for "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue by the US Johnson administration and its followers is a sinister conspiracy.
    The commentary said that Washington has sent many special envoys around the world to deceive and seek support. The Pope has also come forward to issue so-called emergency appeals for peace. The Soviet revisionists and their lackeys are also not missing any opportunity to serve the plans of US imperialism.
    The commentary pointed out that the Johnson administration's energetic propaganda campaign about negotiations is to cover up the US government's measures to expand aggression, and to pretend to be "forced to do so" in the eyes of the world's people, especially the American people.
    The commentary pointed out that the Johnson administration's plan is very sinister. This is not the first time this has happened. How many times, whenever US imperialism took a new step in the "escalation" of its war of aggression, it first organized a propaganda campaign of loud cries for "peace" and "peaceful settlement" in order to conceal its true face. However, the Vietnamese people will not be deceived by masks. US imperialism's road to further expansion of aggression can only lead to lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet.
    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, January 7th. The East Pakistani newspaper *The Eastern Examiner* published an editorial on the 5th, pointing out that the so-called "peace" activities that the United States is carrying out in Vietnam are "a more disgusting trick."
    The editorial accused "the Americans' domineering attitude." The editorial said: "Humility and repentance have never been the strengths of American foreign policy."
    *The Indus Times* published an editorial on December 30th, saying that the US proposal for "unconditional negotiations," in other words, is to negotiate according to US conditions.
    The editorial, in discussing the Soviet Union's attitude towards the US plight in the Vietnam situation, said: Fortunately for the Americans, the Soviet leaders have also provided them with an opportunity to get out of it. They do not insist on the four propositions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They only insist on stopping the bombing of North Vietnam before holding a round table conference.
    Xinhua News Agency, Accra, January 7th. Nakhidi, a representative of the Bechuanaland People's Party, said that the people of the world today must be particularly vigilant against the "peace" tricks played by US imperialism, take a clear stand on the Vietnam issue, and unreservedly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.
    He told Xinhua reporters that history has proven that no force in the world can defeat a people's war. This has been proven once again in Vietnam. He said that because the US imperialists cannot win on the battlefield, they are now talking a lot about so-called "unconditional negotiations" in an attempt to deceive the world and the Vietnamese people.
    Nakhidi pointed out that US imperialism is the aggressor, and the Vietnamese people are the victims of aggression. He said that as long as the US aggressor troops remain in South Vietnam, suppressing the South Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom, the Vietnamese people will not stop fighting, no matter what tricks the aggressors play. He also said that the Vietnam issue is a matter for the Vietnamese people themselves, and only the Vietnamese people themselves can solve it.
    He pointed out that the Vietnamese people's struggle against US imperialism is a great encouragement to all people who are fighting against foreign rule and to all peace-loving people in the world.

    约翰逊的险恶诡计骗不了人
    阿尔巴尼亚和巴基斯坦报纸说美帝得到苏联帮助
    贝专纳人民党代表强调必须无保留地支持越南人民斗争
    新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》七日发表评论指出，美国约翰逊政府及其追随者最近就越南问题发出的“和谈”叫嚷，是一个阴险的阴谋。
    评论说，华盛顿派出许多特使到世界各地进行招摇撞骗，寻求支持。罗马教皇也出面发出所谓为了和平的紧急呼吁。苏联修正主义者及其仆从也不放过为美帝国主义的计划效劳的机会。
    评论指出，约翰逊政府这样卖力地展开关于谈判的大叫大嚷的宣传运动，是为美国政府扩大侵略的措施打掩护，并在世界人民、特别是美国人民眼中装出一副“被迫而为”的样子。
    评论指出，约翰逊政府的计划是十分阴险的。这种情况已经不是第一次发生。有多少次，每当美帝国主义在“逐步升级”的侵略战争中迈出新的
  一步时，就首先组织“和平”和“和平解决”的大叫大嚷的宣传，以便掩盖自己的真正嘴脸。但是，越南人民不会为假面具所欺骗。美帝国主义走向进一步扩大侵略的道路，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    新华社卡拉奇七日电　东巴基斯坦报纸《东方考察者报》五日发表社论，指出美国正在进行的所谓在越南谋求“和平”的活动，是“更加令人厌恶的诡计”。
    社论指责“美国人的霸道态度”。社论说：“谦逊和忏悔从来不是美国外交政策的长处。”
    《印度河时报》十二月三十日发表社论说，美国提出的“无条件谈判”的建议，换句话说，就是根据美国的条件谈判。
    社论在谈到苏联对美国在越南局势中所处的困境采取的态度时说：对美国人来说幸运的是，苏联领导人也为他们脱身提供了机会。他们不坚持越南民主共和国的四项主张。他们只坚持在举行圆桌会议之前停止对越南北方的轰炸。
    新华社阿克拉七日电　贝专纳人民党代表纳基迪说，全世界人民今天必须特别警惕美帝国主义玩弄的“和平”诡计，在越南问题上采取明确的立场，无保留地支持越南人民的正义斗争。
    他对新华社记者说，历史已经证明，世界上任何力量都不能打败人民战争。在越南已经再一次证明了这一点。他说，美帝国主义者由于在战场上不能赢得胜利，现在就大谈特谈所谓“无条件谈判”，企图以此来欺骗世界和越南人民。
    纳基迪指出，美帝国主义是侵略者，越南人民是被侵略者。他说，只要美国侵略军还呆在南越，镇压南越人民争取自由的斗争，越南人民就不会停止斗争，不管侵略者玩弄什么花招。他还说，越南问题是越南人民自己的问题，只有越南人民自己才能解决。
    他指出，越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是对所有正在为反对外国统治而斗争的人民，和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的巨大鼓舞。
