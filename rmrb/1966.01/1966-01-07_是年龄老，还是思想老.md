    Is it Old Age, or Old Thinking?
    Several people meet and immediately say they are old, old. It was under the leadership of these comrades who considered themselves "old" that an advanced county became a backward county; it was also under the firm grasp of these comrades who no longer considered themselves "old" that the county's production landscape rapidly underwent gratifying changes.

    Before 1958, our county was one of the advanced units in the province. But later it changed from advanced to average, and then from average to backward.
    Logically speaking, 40% of our county's communes have electricity, and the water conservancy conditions are also good, so why did we fall behind? After a year of repeated study, the county party committee carefully examined the leadership's thinking, and solicited opinions from the vast number of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, only then did we find the root cause of the problem: the thinking of the county party committee's leading members was "old." Several people would meet and one would say: "I am over half a century old." Another would say: "I am an old man with his head buried in the soil." Some even said: "We are rat tails, just this thick and this long."
    In short, they felt that they were not young anymore, and it was impossible to take on a bigger role. Therefore, they sought no merit, but only to avoid fault.
    Because people's thinking was "old," their revolutionary drive was also "old." They didn't want to go to remote mountain villages, they didn't want to go to teams with lagging work, they didn't want to go to teams with inconvenient transportation; they didn't want to manage advanced teams, they didn't dare to manage backward teams. In daily work, they replaced arduous and in-depth work with meetings, issuing documents, and making phone calls. Take myself as an example, when I started working in the countryside, I carried my own bedding, then I rode a bicycle, and later I would be sent out by car and picked up by car. When I arrived at the production team, I would listen to the cadres' reports at home, look at the crops growing by the village, eat in the canteen, and stay in the commune. I couldn't hear the voices of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and I couldn't see the activists I had personally cultivated during the land reform. For example, the nationally renowned advanced production unit, the Hei'na Brigade, which I personally cultivated in 1950, I hadn't been there for five or six years. I am the secretary in charge of agriculture, but in fact I treated agriculture as a "sideline." Many cadres and members in the mountainous areas reflected: "If you want to see the county party committee, half of your hair will turn white." (meaning they haven't been to their village for several years)
    Because their thinking was "old," their eyes were "old" and couldn't see the problems, their hands were "old" and wouldn't write, their ears were "old" and couldn't hear the words of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the vast number of cadres and party members. Are we really old? No, in terms of age, we are far behind Chairman Mao and many leading comrades of the Central Committee.
    We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works with this word "old" in mind, and personally participated in the socialist education movement for more than a year, and deeply realized that it was not that people were old, but that their revolutionary will had declined. They regarded themselves as old revolutionaries, old leaders, and old positions, and were aloof and complacent.
    Once we raised our awareness and improved our thinking, the people were still the same group, and the place was still the same place. Because we strengthened our leadership, everything changed the year before last. Not only did we have thousand-jin teams and thousand-jin communes, but the county also achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. In 1965, in the face of the most severe drought in more than 20 years, we not only won a good autumn harvest, but also overfulfilled the wheat planting plan, which would have been impossible two years ago. From this, I deeply realized the truth that the human factor is the first, thought is the first, with revolutionary thought, there is revolutionary drive, and with revolutionary drive, revolutionary fruits can be produced.

### 是年龄老，还是思想老

    是年龄老，还是思想老
    几个人一见面就说老了，老了。就是在这些自以为“老”的同志的领导下，一个先进县变成了落后县；也就在这些再不自认“老”的同志狠抓下，全县生产面貌迅速发生可喜的变化
    一九五八年以前，我县是全省先进单位之一。可是后来由先进变成了一般，又由一般变成了后进。
    按理说，我们县百分之四十的公社办起了电，水利条件也好，为什么倒落后了呢？县委经过一年的反复学习，认真检查了领导思想，征求了广大干部和贫下中农代表的意见，才找到了病根，原来是县委领导成员的思想“老”了。几个人一见面，这个说：“我是年过半百的人了。”那个说：“我是土埋到脖子的老头子了。”有的还说：“咱是老鼠尾巴，就这么粗这么长了。”
    总之，认为自己年岁不小了，再担任更大的职务也不可能了。因此不求有功，但求无过。
    由于人的思想“老”了，革命的劲头也“老”了。山区远村不想去了，工作落后的队不想去了，交通不便的队不想去了；先进队不想管，后进队不敢管。在日常工作中，用开会、发文件、打电话代替了艰苦深入的工作。就拿我来说吧，开始下乡工作是背着被子，后来是骑自行车，再后出门就是小汽车送，小汽车接。到了生产队也是家里听听干部汇报，村边看看庄稼长相，吃饭在食堂，住宿在公社，贫农下中农的话听不到了，土改时一手培养起来的积极分子不见面了。如一九五○年自己亲自培养的全国闻名的先进生产单位黑垴大队，就有五六年没去了。我是负责农业的书记，实际上把农业当成了“副业”。不少山区的干部社员反映说：“想给县委见一面，头发就得白一半。”（意思是几年不到他们村里去）
    因为思想“老”了，眼“老”得看不到问题了，手“老”得不动笔了，耳朵“老”得听不进贫农下中农和广大干部、党员的话了。我们是否真的老了呢？不是，从年龄上说比毛主席和中央许多领导同志还差得远哩。
    我们带着这个“老”字反复学习毛主席著作，亲身参加一年多的社会主义教育运动，深深认识到不是人老了，而是革命意志衰退了，以老革命、老领导、老职务自居，高高在上，养尊处优。
    一旦提高了觉悟，提高了思想，人还是我们这一伙，地方还是那一块，因为我们加强了领导，前年，样样都变了，不但出现了千斤队、千斤社，全县粮棉也获得了大丰收。一九六五年在二十多年来未有的严重干旱情况下，不但夺取了秋季较好收成，还超额完成了种麦计划，这是两年以前万万办不到的。由此我深刻地体会到人的因素第一，思想第一，有了革命的思想，才有革命的干劲，有了革命的劲头，才能结出革命的硕果的道理。
