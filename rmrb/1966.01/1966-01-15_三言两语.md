      Not Difficult to Understand
    The weekly *U.S. News & World Report*, in an article, lamented America's unprecedented isolation in the war of aggression against Vietnam, complaining that "America's 'allies' are unwilling to be dragged into the water." It quoted a senior American officer as saying, "This experience in Vietnam makes you wonder: What has the effort to win reliable allies in the twenty years after the war achieved?"
    What is there not to understand about this? Did the American rulers think that by spending a few stinking dollars, others would willingly be buried with them?
      Where's the Calm?
    *The New York Times* touted Johnson's "State of the Union Address," saying that "the characteristic of his language is a calm tone."
    Johnson was clearly clamoring in his "Address" to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, even blurting out his inner thoughts that the United States would "never retreat" in South Vietnam, "must stay," and that the United States would "fight on" no matter how great the risks. Can this still be considered "calm"? The senior editors of *The New York Times* are perhaps a bit too uncalm.
      Opening Without Disbursing
    Bell, the administrator of the U.S. "Agency for International Development," announced in Bangkok that the United States would step up "aid" to Thailand to promote the "Accelerated Rural Development Program," mainly used for building strategic highways, and the "Domestic Security" plan to develop police organizations to suppress patriotic forces.
    From this, we can see what the U.S. "Agency for International Development" is, and what its "aid" is all about. What the United States wants to "develop" are nothing more than military bases and colonies, and its "aid" is mainly used to maintain the reactionary rule of some puppets and lackeys over the people. This is why many countries receive more U.S. aid, the less development they get, and the less security they have at the same time.

    三言两语
      并不难懂
    《美国新闻与世界报道》周刊在一篇文章中，哀叹美国在侵越战争中处境空前孤立，埋怨“美国的‘盟友’都不愿意被拉下水。”它引用一个美国高级军官的话说，“在越南得到的这一经验，使你弄不懂：（美国）战后二十年来为争取可靠的盟友所作的努力到底取得了什么结果。”
    这有什么弄不懂的呢？难道美国统治者以为花几个臭钱，别人就会甘心给他们陪葬吗？
    何冷静之有？
      《纽约时报》为约翰逊的“国情咨文”捧场，说什么“他的语言的特点是腔调冷静”。
    约翰逊明明是在他的“咨文”中叫嚷要扩大侵越战争，甚至把美国在南越“决不退让”、“一定要留下来”、不论风险多大美国将“打下去”这样的心里话都脱口而出了，这还能算得上是“冷静”？《纽约时报》的主笔老爷们未免有点太不冷静了。
      开而不发
    美国“国际开发总署”署长贝尔在曼谷宣布，美国将加紧“援助”泰国推行主要用于修筑战略公路的“加速乡村建设计划”和发展警察组织以镇压爱国力量的“国内安全”计划。
    从这里可以看到，美国的“国际开发总署”是个什么东西，它的“援助”又是什么玩艺儿。美国要“开发”的不过是军事基地和殖民地，它的“援助”主要是用来维持一些傀儡和仆从对人民的反动统治。这就是为什么许多国家接受美援越多，越得不到发展，同时也越没有安全。
