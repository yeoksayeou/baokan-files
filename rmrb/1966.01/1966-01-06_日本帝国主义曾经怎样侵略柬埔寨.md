    In 1940, Japanese imperialism had already occupied most of China. In preparation for launching the Pacific War of Aggression, it first set about seizing Indochina as a base for southward advance. In that year, Japan issued an ultimatum to the French government, which then occupied Indochina, demanding to advance into Indochina. The Vichy government of France, which had already been occupied by Hitler's Nazi troops, was forced to agree. On July 29, 1941, Japan and the Vichy government signed the "Franco-Japanese Protocol on Joint Defense of French Indochina," stipulating that France and Japan would guarantee military "cooperation" to "jointly defend" Indochina. On the same day, the Vichy government notified the Japanese government, agreeing that Japan had the right to send land, sea, and air forces to station in southern Indochina; Japan could use the sea and air bases in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Kompong Cham in Cambodia, and certain places in Vietnam; Japanese invading troops had the right to station and move freely in Indochina, etc. At this point, Japanese imperialism took over the entire military control of Indochina from the French colonialists. Like Vietnam and Laos, the Cambodian people were ravaged by the Japanese imperialist aggressors.
    After occupying Cambodia, Japanese imperialism carried out frantic economic plunder, seizing large quantities of rice, rubber, and pepper. For the needs of the war of aggression, the Japanese invaders also forced the Cambodian people to bear Japanese military expenses and convert rice fields to grow hemp and tung trees, which were needed for military resources.
    During its occupation of Cambodia, Japanese imperialism also instigated Thailand to demand some Cambodian territories from France. Under pressure from Japan, France was forced to cede some areas of Cambodia to Thailand.
    On March 9, 1945, the Japanese aggressors forced France to hand over the entire rule of Indochina. During the Japanese aggressors' occupation of Cambodia, the Cambodian people launched many armed uprisings, such as the armed rebellion in 1943 in protest against the arrest of the high monk Acha Hem Chieu. Although suppressed by the occupiers, the anti-Japanese armed struggle spread to many provinces in the country and gained increasing momentum.
    After Japanese imperialism announced its surrender in August 1945, it was forced to withdraw from Cambodia. Today, the Cambodian people will never allow U.S. imperialism to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, invading and plundering Cambodia.

    日本帝国主义曾经怎样侵略柬埔寨
    一九四○年，日本帝国主义已经侵占了大半个中国，它为了准备发动太平洋侵略战争，首先着手夺取印度支那作为南进基地。在这一年，日本向当时侵占印度支那的法国政府提出进军印度支那的通牒，已经遭到希特勒纳粹军队占领的法国维希政府被迫同意。一九四一年七月二十九日，日本同维希政府签订“法日共同防守法属印度支那议定书”，规定法日两国保证军事“合作”，以“共同防守”印度支那。同日，维希政府照会日本政府，同意日本有权派遣陆、海、空军驻印度支那南部；日本可以使用柬埔寨的金边、暹粒、磅咋叻和越南若干地方的海、空基地；日本侵略军在印度支那有驻扎权和自由移动权等等。至此，日本帝国主义即从法国殖民者手里接管了整个印度支那的军事控制权。同越南和老挝一样，柬埔寨人民遭到日本帝国主义侵略者的蹂躏。
    日本帝国主义在侵占柬埔寨后，进行了疯狂的经济掠夺，抢走大批大米、橡胶和胡椒等。为了侵略战争的需要，日本侵略者还强迫柬埔寨人民负担日本军费并把稻田改种军需资源麻和桐树。
    日本帝国主义在侵占柬埔寨期间，还唆使泰国向法国索取柬埔寨的若干领土。法国在日本的压力下，被迫把柬埔寨的一些地方割让给泰国。
    一九四五年三月九日，日本侵略者强迫法国交出了整个印度支那的统治权。在日本侵略者占领柬埔寨期间，柬埔寨人民曾进行了多次武装起义，如一九四三年因抗议逮捕高僧阿查·汗鸠而发生的武装暴动，虽然遭到占领者的镇压，但是抗日武装斗争波及到国内许多个省，声势越来越大。
    日本帝国主义在一九四五年八月宣布投降后，被迫退出了柬埔寨。今天，柬埔寨人民决不会听任美帝国主义重走日本帝国主义的老路，侵占和掠夺柬埔寨。
