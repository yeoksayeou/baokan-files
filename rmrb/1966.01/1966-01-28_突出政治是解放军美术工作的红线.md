Edition: 6

    Recently, some professional art workers and amateur worker-peasant-soldier art workers in Sichuan, in order to learn from the People's Liberation Army art workers, watched slides of works from the All-Army Art Exhibition in Chongqing and conducted discussions, identifying their own shortcomings, which greatly encouraged and promoted our creation. This time, we were also pleased to visit the themed art exhibition "Standing Ready, Those Who Come Will Be Annihilated" by naval professional and amateur art workers. At the exhibition, I repeatedly and carefully looked at these works, linking them with my previous learning experiences, and felt even more that emphasizing politics is a red line of the People's Liberation Army art work. This is consistent with the People's Liberation Army's various services, under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, adhering to the "Four Firsts," carrying out the "Four Good" company movement, and learning from Lei Feng and Wang Jie's revolutionary spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. These works are products of this revolutionary spirit, products of the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.

    In recent years, I have deeply realized that when we study Chairman Mao's works, learning from those exemplary figures who creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and combining the two will yield greater results. The themed art works "Standing Ready, Those Who Come Will Be Annihilated" are an example of the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. They tightly grasp the red line of emphasizing politics, demonstrating the spirit of the People's Navy standing ready and daring to annihilate invading enemies, truly reflecting the essence of the People's Liberation Army, and profoundly demonstrating the power of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. The major victories of our naval forces in various naval battles and the major victories of naval aviation in air battles have all displayed national prestige and military might. The authors chose this major theme and subject matter, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the People's Navy annihilating invading enemies in actual combat. Vividly depicting national prestige and military might, that is politics.

    These works also prominently reflect the idea of people being the primary factor in people's war. Almost all the paintings depict heroic images of people not fearing hardship or death in actual combat; depicting the decisive role of people in war. The authors did not slack off because some subjects were not easy to handle, they did not avoid the difficult and choose to paint scenes mainly of scenery or weapons. They did not retreat in the face of difficulty, but used the revolutionary spirit of advancing in the face of difficulty to treat art creation, not being restricted by those conventions and patterns, and creatively reflecting combat life. Emphasizing people, emphasizing the role of people, and emphasizing the revolutionary spirit of people is also emphasizing politics.

    The works also focus on praising two aspects: First, praising the leadership of the Party, praising the correctness of the Party's strategic policies, and emphasizing the importance of arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought. For example, propaganda posters and series such as "Reporting to Chairman Mao" and "Resolutely Implement the Five Principles of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's Instructions." Second, praising the role of the people, praising the people in various combat positions. The victory of a battle is not determined by just one or two heroic figures, but from the military to the people, from commanders to privates, all playing an active role. Looking at the "August 6 Naval Battle," the "Chongwu Naval Battle" series, the "Heroes of the August 6 Naval Battle," and the "Heroes of the Chongwu Naval Battle," this characteristic is very clearly demonstrated. Those captains, instructors, artillery commanders, engine room squad leaders, electromechanical soldiers, radio operators, loaders, ammunition carriers, aimers, signal soldiers, radar soldiers, etc., all were fully represented. The works profoundly depict the heroic group portrait that determined the victory of the battle, demonstrating their bravery and tenacity, and that noble spirit of you in me and me in you as a whole. Emphasizing the role of the masses is emphasizing the important characteristics of people's war, and emphasizing this characteristic is also emphasizing politics.

    These works highlight the above themes and ideas, embodying Chairman Mao's thought on people's war throughout the entire work. Naval professional and amateur art workers have grasped this red line from beginning to end, which is the ideological foundation for the success of this batch of works.

    The authors also implemented Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on the literary and art work of the troops, achieving political, life, and technical excellence. In creation, emphasizing politics, they achieved political excellence; naval professional art workers lived and fought together with naval soldiers, and the amateur art workers depicted their own lives, so the characters were vivid, typical, and yet generalized, which is the effect achieved due to the authors' life excellence; they were able to vividly express the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army and the characteristics of people's war, and moved the audience, which would not have been possible without excellent technique.

    We often say that in creation, we must grasp the most important and essential things of things. How can we grasp these things? The People's Liberation Army's art workers have set a good example for us—that is, emphasizing politics. Serving the soldiers is like this, and serving the peasants and workers is also like this.

    突出政治是解放军美术工作的红线
    李少言
    最近，四川的部分专业美术工作者和工农兵业余美术工作者，为了向解放军美术工作者学习，在重庆看了全军美展作品的幻灯片，进行了讨论，找了自己的差距，对我们的创作起了很大的鼓舞和推动作用。这次又高兴地参观了海军专业与业余美术工作者的《严阵以待，来者必歼》专题美术作品展览。在展览会上，我反复地、仔细地看了这些作品，同我以前的学习心得联系起来，就更加感觉到，突出政治，是解放军美术工作的一条红线，这与中国人民解放军各兵种在中央军委领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持四个第一，开展创造四好连队运动，大学雷锋、王杰一心为人民的革命精神是相一致的。这些作品就是这种革命精神的产物，是活学活用毛泽东思想的产物。
    近年来，我深刻地体会到，在我们学习毛主席著作的同时，向那些活学活用毛泽东思想的典范人物学习，把两者结合起来，收效才会更大。《严阵以待，来者必歼》专题美术作品，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的范例之一。他们紧紧抓住突出政治这条红线，表现了人民海军的严阵以待，敢于歼灭来犯之敌的精神面貌，真实地反映了人民解放军的本质，深刻地表现出毛主席人民战争思想的威力。我国海军部队历次海战的重大胜利，和海军航空兵在空战中的重大胜利，都打出了国威和军威，作者选择了这个重大主题和题材，表现人民海军在实战中歼灭来犯之敌的英雄气魄。形象地描绘出了国威和军威，这就是政治。
    这些作品又突出地反映了在人民战争中，人的因素第一的思想。差不多所有的画幅都是刻划人在实战中一不怕苦，二不怕死的英雄形象；刻划人在战争中的决定作用。作者们没有因为某些题材不容易处理而偷懒，他们没有避重就轻地去画些以景物为主，或以武器为主的场面，他们不是知难而退，而是用知难而进的革命精神去对待美术创作，不受那些框框套套的限制，创造性地反映了战斗生活。突出人、突出人的作用、突出人的革命精神也就是突出了政治。
    作品还着重歌颂了这样两个方面：第一，歌颂党的领导，歌颂党的战略方针的正确，强调用毛泽东思想武装头脑的重要意义。例如《向毛主席汇报》和《坚决贯彻林彪副主席指示的五项原则》宣传画、组画等。第二，歌颂人民群众的作用，歌颂在各个战斗岗位上的人。一次战斗的胜利，决不只是一两个英雄人物所决定的，而是从军到民，从指挥员到列兵，都起着积极的作用。看看《八六海战》、《崇武海战》组画，《八六海战英雄谱》和《崇武海战英雄谱》，就十分鲜明地表现出这个特点。那些艇长、指导员、炮长、轮机班长、机电兵、报务员、装填手、运弹手、瞄准手、信号兵、雷达兵等等，所有的人都得到了充分的表现。作品深刻地描绘了取决战斗胜利的英雄群象，表现了他们的英勇顽强和那种崇高的你中有我、我中有你的整体思想。突出群众的作用，就是突出人民战争的重要特征，突出这个特征，也就是突出政治。
    这些作品突出了以上的主题思想，就在整个作品中体现出毛主席人民战争的思想。海军专业与业余美术工作者自始至终抓住了这条红线，这是这批作品获得成功的思想基础。
    作者们还执行了林彪同志对部队文艺工作的指示，做到了政治、生活、技术三过硬。在创作中突出政治，做到了政治过硬；海军专业美术工作者同海军战士生活在一起，战斗在一起，业余美术工作者所描绘的就是他们自己本身的生活，因此人物生动、典型而又概括，这是由于作者生活过硬而获得的效果；他们能够形象地表现出解放军的特点和人民战争的特点，并感动了观众，没有过硬的技术也是不可能的。
    我们常常说，在创作中要抓住事物中最主要、最本质的东西，怎样才能抓住这些东西？解放军的美术工作者给我们树立了好的样板——这就是突出政治。为兵服务是如此，为农民服务、为工人服务也是如此。（附图片）
