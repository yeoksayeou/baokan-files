    Let Mao Zedong Thought Become a Sharp Weapon in the Hands of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    When Faced with Difficult Problems, Find the Answer in Chairman Mao's Works
    Ma Hui-shun (female, 24 years old), Assistant Technician of the Oil Construction Command of Daqing Oilfield
    In oilfield construction, thousands of kilometers of pipelines need to be buried. Our region has a lot of alkaline land and water, which makes pipelines prone to corrosion and perforation. Once a pipeline breaks, it is very difficult to repair. We have been working on solving this problem for several years, but we haven't completely resolved it. We have used fiberglass cloth, asphalt, and plastic tape, but the cost is very high, and we still can't guarantee the quality.

    Determined to Make a Decision, Courageous to Practice
    The year before last, we accepted the task of experimenting with and researching pipeline anti-corrosion insulation, and formed a pipeline anti-corrosion insulation task force with comrades from the Oilfield Construction Design and Research Institute. At that time, we couldn't find a way, and it was very difficult to complete it and put it into production in a few months. First, among the twenty technical cadres and fourteen workers in our task force, only one was an experienced fitter technician, and the rest were students who graduated after 1961, with an average age of less than 25. They had seen little, heard little, and had even less experience. Second, there was very little information, especially regarding molding machinery; there were no reference materials at all. Third, among us, apart from a few comrades from the Design Institute who had done experiments, the rest were majoring in mechanics, oil production, storage and transportation, etc. Some didn't even know what "insulation" was. Under these circumstances, some people were worried about us, fearing that we were not sure. However, the leaders strongly supported us, encouraging us by saying: "To attack the cutting edge, we must dare to break through and dare to act, but also calmly study. If there are difficult problems, look for answers in Chairman Mao's works." Later, we repeatedly studied "On Practice." Chairman Mao taught us: "We often hear some comrades say when they cannot bravely accept work assignments: 'I'm not sure.' Why are they not sure? Because they do not have a regular understanding of the content and environment of this work, or they have never been exposed to this type of work, or have not been exposed to it much, and therefore cannot talk about the regularity of this type of work." Chairman Mao's words were as if directly addressed to us, making us realize that to ensure that this experiment is successful, we must dare to practice and constantly understand and master its regularity in practice. So, we were determined to venture and work in practice.

    Comprehensive Analysis, Attacking Three Barriers Simultaneously
    Now that the decision was made, how should we proceed? Our skill level was low, our experience was little, and there were few reference materials. We couldn't just rely on brute force. To capture the ox, you have to capture the nose; we should target the key points of pipeline anti-corrosion insulation. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive process analysis and made it clear that to complete this task, we must break through three barriers: First, the material barrier. This is the material formula and performance indicators; second, the molding barrier. This is uniformly applying the material to the pipe. If it can't be wrapped around the pipe, even if the performance is good, it will be useless; third, the process barrier. There must be a set of mechanized production processes.

    At that time, some people advocated following the old framework, conquering the material formula first, and then thinking about how to apply it to the pipe. If we do this steadily, step by step, we will eventually succeed one day. But this approach is not feasible for our oilfield construction. Because production urgently needs to solve the insulation problem, if the material test is delayed, it will affect the quality of pipeline construction. The leaders repeatedly told us that scientific research should have a sense of time. If we lose time, we will not be able to catch up with others. If we lose time, it will no longer be called new technology, but old technology. We decided to attack the three barriers simultaneously.

    Some people said that attacking the three barriers simultaneously was reckless. Whether it was reckless or not, we conducted a serious analysis and study, and concluded that attacking the three barriers simultaneously was the right thing to do. To ensure that the performance of the material is fully up to standard, we should select a good material formula, apply it to the pipe, and conduct repeated tests according to the actual situation in the Daqing area to ensure that the indicators are excellent. The molding test also requires the material formula to provide data on temperature, pressure, and other conditions. The process design must also be based on the performance requirements of the material and the understanding gained in the molding test. Therefore, the three barriers are interconnected, not isolated.

    Attacking Three Barriers Simultaneously, Focus is Necessary
    Attacking the three barriers simultaneously also requires a focus; we cannot use our strength equally. After research, we decided to make the molding process our main attack direction. In the beginning, we had no experience at all. We went to learn from wherever we heard there were molding-related things. In the process of visiting and learning, we saw the molding of welding rods in other units, which inspired us greatly. After returning, we started designing the molding machine based on the molding principle of the welding rod coating. To constantly explore experience from practice and obtain correct designs, we first designed a small testing machine, then repeatedly tested and improved it to provide reliable technical data for the formal design and manufacture of the molding machine. Doing this requires designing twice and manufacturing two sets of equipment. On the surface, it seems slow, but it is actually fast. The first testing machine was modified forty-nine times and took five months and ten days. The formal molding machine took only two months from design to production, and it was a success the first time.

    Through continuous repeated experiments, we finally developed pipeline anti-corrosion insulation with low cost and good insulation performance. This made us deeply realize that in scientific experiments, we must be honest and recognize and transform things step by step through repeated practice. Those who directly participate in practice have the most say. Those who are not afraid of failure and insist on repeated practice are the most capable of resolving contradictions. Only by going through practice can we go from not knowing to knowing, from having no experience to having experience.

    让毛泽东思想变为工农兵手中的锐利武器
    有疑难问题，就到毛主席著作中找答案
    大庆油田油建指挥部助理技术员　马慧舜（女，二十四岁）
    油田建设中要埋下上千公里的管线，而我们地区碱地多，水多，管线容易被腐蚀穿孔。管线一旦坏了，修理起来很不容易。为了解决这个问题，我们攻了好几年，都没有彻底解决。玻璃布、沥青、塑料带都用过了，结果，成本很高，还是保证不了质量。
    下定决心  勇于实践
    前年，我们接受试验和研究管道防腐绝缘的任务，同油田建设设计研究院的同志一起组成了管道防腐绝缘攻关队。当时，我们摸不到门路，要在几个月内搞成并用到生产上，困难很多。第一，我们攻关队二十名技术干部和十四名工人中，只有一名有经验的钳工技师，其余都是一九六一年以后毕业的学生，平均年龄不到二十五岁，见得少，听的不多，更没有经验；第二，资料很少，特别是成型机械方面，根本没有参考资料；第三，我们这些人中，除设计院个别同志搞过试验外，其余的人是学机械、采油、储运等专业的，有的连什么是“绝缘”还搞不清。在这种情况下，有人为我们担心，怕没有把握。但是，领导同志大力支持，鼓励我们说：“攻尖端既要敢闯敢干，又要冷静地研究。有疑难问题，就到毛主席著作中找答案。”后来，我们反复学习了《实践论》。毛主席教导我们说：“常常听到一些同志在不能勇敢接受工作任务时说出来的一句话：没有把握。为什么没有把握呢？因为他对于这项工作的内容和环境没有规律性的了解，或者他从来就没有接触过这类工作，或者接触得不多，因而无从谈到这类工作的规律性”。毛主席的话，就象是直接对我们说的，使我们认识到，要使这次试验搞得有把握，就要敢于实践，在实践中不断认识和掌握它的规律性。于是，我们下定决心，到实践中去闯、去干。
    全面分析  三关齐攻
    决心定了，怎么干呢？水平低，经验少，参考资料不多。凭蛮干不行，牵牛要牵牛鼻子，应当针对管道防腐绝缘的要害打。随后，我们进行了全面的工艺分析，明确了要完成这项任务，必须突破三关：第一，材料关。就是材料配方和性能指标；第二，成型关。就是均匀地把材料抹到管子上，如果包不到管子上，性能再好，也是白费劲；第三，工艺关。必须有一套机械化的生产过程。
    当时，有人主张按旧的框框办事，把材料配方攻下来，再想法往管子上抹。这样四平八稳的干，一步步实现，总有一天会搞成功。但这种做法对于我们的油田建设，是行不通的。因为生产上急需解决绝缘问题，如果材料试验拖长了时间，就会影响管道建设的质量。领导一再告诉我们，搞科学研究要有个时间观念，失掉时间，就没有办法赶上别人；失掉时间，也就不叫新技术，而叫老技术了。我们决定三关齐攻。
    有人说三关齐攻是胡来。到底是不是胡来，我们进行了认真的分析研究，认为三关齐攻是对的。要想保证材料的性能完全过关，应当在选定一个好的材料配方之后，抹到管子上，按大庆地区的实际情况做反复试验，才能保证指标过硬。成型试验时需要的温度、压力等条件，也要求材料配方提供资料。工艺设计也要以材料的性能要求和成型试验中的认识作依据。因此，三关之间是互相联系的，不是孤立的。
    三关齐攻  要有重点
    三关齐攻，还要有重点，不能平均使用力量。经过研究，确定把成型工艺作为我们的主攻方向。开始，我们一点经验也没有，听到那里有成型的东西，就去学习。在参观学习中，看到其他单位的焊条成型，对我们启发很大。回来后，我们便根据焊条外皮的成型原理，开始了成型机的设计。为了从实践中不断摸索经验，得出正确设计，我们先设计一台小试验机，再反复试验改进，为正式设计和制造成型机提供可靠的技术数据。这样做，要设计两次，制造两台设备，表面上看起来好象慢了，实际上是快了。第一台试验机改了四十九次，用了五个月零十天，正式成型机从设计到投产，只用了两个月，并且一次成功。
    经过不断反复地试验，我们终于搞成了成本低、绝缘性能好的管道防腐绝缘。这使我们深深地体会到，科学实验中，必须老老实实，从反复实践中一步一步地认识事物、改造事物。最有发言权的，是直接参加实践的人；最会解决矛盾的，是不怕失败，坚持反复实践的人。只有一切通过实践，才能从不会到会，从没有经验到有经验。
