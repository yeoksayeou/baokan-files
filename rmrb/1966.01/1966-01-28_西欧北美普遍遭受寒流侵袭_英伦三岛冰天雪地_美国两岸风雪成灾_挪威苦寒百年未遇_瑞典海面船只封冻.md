    Western Europe and North America Universally Afflicted by Cold Wave
    British Isles Icy and Snowy; Snowstorms Plague Both Coasts of the United States
    Norway Experiences Unprecedented Cold in a Century; Ships Frozen in Swedish Waters
    (Xinhua News Agency, January 26) Western Europe and North America have recently been universally afflicted by cold waves and blizzards, and some countries have experienced unprecedented cold in a century.
    In Britain, snow and ice have recently covered England, Wales, and Scotland, bringing transportation to a standstill in many areas, with strings of vehicles stranded on snow-covered roads.
    The industrial heart of Britain, the Midlands region of England, has been paralyzed due to reduced gas supplies. Thousands of workers are idle, and assembly lines in automobile and machinery factories have ground to a halt.
    According to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, Oslo, the capital of Norway, experienced its coldest day since formal records began 132 years ago.
    Sweden has also experienced its coldest winter since 1881. The temperature in the capital, Stockholm, is minus 30 degrees Celsius. Large chunks of ice are causing difficulties for shipping in ports in central and northern Sweden. It is reported that forty-three ships are icebound in the northern Baltic Sea.
    Temperatures are also very low in France, with many rivers in the central and eastern parts of the country already frozen, and thick ice floes floating in the Seine in Paris.
    According to reports, the United States has recently been hit by another cold wave, with most areas east of the Rocky Mountains already freezing. In Williston, North Dakota, the temperature has dropped to minus 28 degrees Celsius, and in Lewistown, Montana, it has also dropped to minus 27 degrees Celsius.
  Xinhua News Agency, January 27 (Washington) A blizzard fiercely struck five states along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States on the 26th and is continuing to move inland and north.
    According to reports, some areas of Virginia and North Carolina have received up to eight inches of snow, and the snow accumulation in Roanoke has reached one foot. South Carolina, Georgia, and California have also been hit by heavy rain and snow. The U.S. Weather Bureau issued an alert that day, announcing that storms were about to hit large areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.
    Recently, the weather across the United States has been very abnormal: the West and Midwest have been successively hit by storms and blizzards, while the severe drought that has persisted in the Northeast for more than four years continues, with some places experiencing drought conditions that have not been seen in centuries. This area is particularly densely populated, so the water shortage problem is particularly serious.

    西欧北美普遍遭受寒流侵袭
    英伦三岛冰天雪地　美国两岸风雪成灾
    挪威苦寒百年未遇　瑞典海面船只封冻
    据新华社二十六日讯　西欧和北美最近普遍遭到寒流和暴风雪的侵袭，有些国家出现了百年不遇的严寒。
    在英国，雪和冰冻最近封盖英格兰、威尔士和苏格兰等地，许多地区的交通运输陷于停顿，成串的车辆被阻在冰雪覆盖的道路上。
    英国的工业中枢——英格兰中部地区由于煤气供应削减而陷于瘫痪。成千上万的工人无工可作，汽车工厂和机械工厂的装配线已经停顿。
    据挪威气象局说，挪威首都奥斯陆遭到了自从一百三十二年前开始正式有纪录以来的最寒冷的日子。
    瑞典也遇到了自从一八八一年以来最冷的冬天。首都斯德哥尔摩的温度是摄氏零下三十度。大块的浮冰给瑞典中部和北部的港口的航运造成了困难。据报告，有四十三艘船在北波罗的海被冰封住了。
    法国的气温也很低，中部和东部的许多河流早已封冻，巴黎的塞纳河里漂浮着很厚的冰块。
    据报道，最近美国又遭到寒流的袭击，落基山脉以东的大部分地区都已滴水成冰。在北达科他州的威利斯敦，气温已经下降到零下二十八度，在蒙大拿州的刘易斯敦，也下降到零下二十七度。
  新华社二十七日讯　华盛顿消息：暴风雪二十六日猛烈袭击美国大西洋和太平洋沿岸的五个州，而且正在继续向内地和北部各州侵袭。
    据报道，弗吉尼亚州和北卡罗来纳州的一些地区，降雪达八英寸，劳诺克一地的积雪已达一英尺。南卡罗来纳州、佐治亚州和加利福尼亚州也受到暴雨和大雪的侵袭。美国气象局在当天发出警报，宣布暴风雨即将袭击纽约、新泽西和康涅狄格等州的广大地区。
    最近一个时期来，美国各地的天时一直十分不正常：西部和中西部接连遭受暴风雨和暴风雪的袭击，而东北部持续了四年多的大旱仍在继续中，有些地方的旱情，是几百年从未遇到过的。这一地区人口特别稠密，因此水荒问题也特别严重。
