    Two "Base Numbers"
    Gan Feng
    Liberation Army soldiers put it well: "We must always keep two base numbers in mind: one is 650 million, and the other is 3 billion."
    What does this sentence mean? It means that we must "have the motherland in our hearts and the world in our eyes," strengthen the concept of "two revolutions" (the Chinese revolution and the world revolution) and "two peoples" (the Chinese people and the people of the world), and strive to build our country into a modern socialist power and to realize the great communist ideal throughout the world. All our work, the starting point for all our considerations, should be based on these two "base numbers."
    We often talk about the question of worldview. In fact, the most fundamental thing is whether everything is for the Chinese people and the people of the world, or whether everything is for the individual and the small family. That is to say, the "base number" in our minds is 650 million and 3 billion, or the insignificant 1, 3, or 5.
    The "base number" in the minds of bourgeois individualists is 1, and even with their small family, it is only 3 or 5. They revolve around the "base number" of 1, 3, or 5 all day long, busy and distressed, living their lives on a personal abacus.
    There are also some comrades who work very hard, but the "base number" in their minds is not 650 million and 3 billion, but 50, 100, or even more. They only see the part of the local work they are engaged in, only see the unit where they work, and often cannot see the big picture and lack lofty revolutionary ideals.
    To always have these two "base numbers" of 650 million and 3 billion in mind is not like a primary school student memorizing a phone number, just remembering it. This is a fundamental transformation of worldview, a fundamental shift in thoughts and feelings, and having a revolution in one's heart at all times. We must squeeze out individualism from our minds in order to put these two "base numbers" of 650 million and 3 billion in. When the starting point for our consideration of problems is often 650 million and 3 billion, we can stand tall and say that our thinking has entered the realm of "having the motherland in our hearts and the world in our eyes."

    两个“基数”
    敢峰
    解放军战士说得好：“脑子里要经常装着两个基数：一个是六亿五，一个是三十亿。”
      这句话是什么意思呢？就是说要“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”，加强“两个革命”（中国革命和世界革命）、“两个人民”（中国人民和世界人民）的观念，为把我国建设成为一个现代化的社会主义强国和在全世界实现伟大的共产主义理想而奋斗。我们的一切工作，我们考虑一切问题的出发点，都应当建立在这两个“基数”上。
    我们常常谈到世界观的问题，其实说穿了最根本的就是一切为了中国人民和世界人民，还是一切为了个人和小家庭。这也就是说，我们脑子里装着的“基数”是六亿五和三十亿，还是渺小的一、三、五。
    资产阶级个人主义者脑子里的“基数”就是一，加上他的小家庭也不过是三或者五，他们成天围绕着一、三、五的“基数”转来转去，奔忙着，苦恼着，在个人的小算盘上过日月。
    也还有一些同志，他们在工作上很努力，但是他们脑子里装的“基数”不是六亿五和三十亿，而是五十、一百或者再多一些。他们只看到自己所从事的这一部分局部工作，只看到自己工作的单位，往往看不到大局，缺乏远大的革命理想。
    脑子里要经常装着六亿五和三十亿这两个“基数”，这并不象小学生背电话号码一样，记住就行了。这是一个世界观的根本改造问题，是思想感情的根本转变问题，是心中时时刻刻有个革命的问题。我们要把头脑中的个人主义挤出来，才能把六亿五和三十亿这两个“基数”装进去。当我们考虑问题的出发点经常是六亿五和三十亿的时候，我们就可以挺起胸膛来说，我们的思想已经进入“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”的境界了。
