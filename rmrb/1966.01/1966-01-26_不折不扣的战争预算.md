    The budget proposed by Johnson is an unadulterated war budget. It lays bare the Johnson administration's plot to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam in broad daylight.
    Under the so-called "Vietnam special expenses" item, the budget stipulates that direct expenditures for the war of aggression against Vietnam are $10.3 billion, more than double the $4.7 billion of the current fiscal year. Moreover, this figure does not, in fact, include all of the U.S. war expenses for aggression against Vietnam; many expenses are buried in other items.
    Not only that, as can be seen from Johnson's three supplementary war appropriations for aggression against Vietnam this year, he will not be bound by this budget. Johnson openly declared in his "Budget Message": "If developments in Southeast Asia require additional funding, I will not hesitate to request the necessary funds." This is exactly the meaning of "Do not say you were not warned."
    However, Johnson still had to act coyly, saying a lot of comforting words, such as "If our efforts to seek a decent peace bear fruit, these funds will not need to be spent," and "If our efforts to seek peace in Vietnam are successful, we can quickly adjust the budget," and that the Vietnam problem "If it can be resolved sooner, much of these expenses may not be needed," and so on.
    This proves once again that Johnson's "peace talks" charade, which he has put so much effort into, is a conspiracy to cover up the conspiracy to expand the war. At the same time, this also shows that Johnson's policy of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam is extremely unpopular in the United States, so he had to resort to some charlatanry when presenting his war budget.
    Johnson has clearly made up his mind to continue down the path of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and has proposed a series of measures in the "Budget Message" to attack the American people. But he still wants the American people to believe that they will "have both guns and butter." What a clumsy deception! Johnson's lies will soon go bankrupt, and the American people will immediately see from the continuously increasing tax burden and the increasingly heavy exploitation that the damage they suffer from the expanded war is even more intolerable, and therefore their wave of opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam will inevitably be even higher.

### 不折不扣的战争预算

    不折不扣的战争预算
    约翰逊提出的新预算，是一个不折不扣的战争预算。它把约翰逊政府决心进一步扩大侵越战争的阴谋暴露在光天化日之下。
    在所谓“越南特别费用”项下，预算规定直接用于侵越战争的开支为一百零三亿美元，比本年度的四十七亿美元增加了一倍多。而且这个数字，事实上并没有包括美国全部侵越战费，还有许多开支在其他项目打了埋伏。
    不仅如此，从本年度约翰逊三次追加侵越战费就可以知道，他是不会受这个预算束缚的。约翰逊在他的“预算咨文”中就公开宣称：“如果东南亚的事态发展得需要额外的经费，我将毫不犹豫地要求必需的款项”。这正是所谓“勿谓言之不预也”。
    但是，约翰逊还要扭扭捏捏，说了一大堆宽慰人心的话，什么“如果我们谋求体面的和平的努力带来结果，这些经费就不需要花了”啦，什么“如果我们在越南寻求和平的努力成功的话，我们可以迅速调整预算”啦，什么越南问题“如果能够早日解决，这些开支中许多就可以不需要”啦，等等。
    这就再一次证明，约翰逊费尽力气去搞的“和谈”骗局是掩盖扩大战争阴谋的阴谋。同时，这也表明，约翰逊的扩大侵越战争的政策在美国国内是极不得人心的，因此他在提出他的战争预算时不能不施展一番江湖骗术。
    约翰逊明明已下定决心沿着扩大侵越战争的道路走下去，而且在“预算咨文”中提出了一系列向美国人民进攻的措施，但他居然还想要美国人民相信他们将会
  “大炮和黄油兼而有之”。这是多么拙劣的欺骗手法！约翰逊的谎言很快就会破产，美国人民立即就会从继续增高的税负中，从日益加重的种种剥削中，看到他们遭到扩大战争的损害更加不能忍受，因而他们反对侵越战争的浪潮也必将更加高涨。
