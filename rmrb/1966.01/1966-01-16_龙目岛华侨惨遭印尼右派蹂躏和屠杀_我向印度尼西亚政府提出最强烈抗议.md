    Overseas Chinese in Lombok Tragically Ravaged and Massacred by Indonesian Rightists
    I Lodge the Strongest Protest to the Indonesian Government
    The Chinese Embassy pointed out in a note: This is a heinous crime organized and planned by right-wing forces serving imperialism. It demands that the Indonesian government severely punish the instigators and murderers, immediately provide compensation to the families of the victims, and compensate for all losses suffered by the overseas Chinese.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia delivered a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 12th, lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the bloody atrocities committed by thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing forces against overseas Chinese residing in various regions of Lombok at the end of last year, involving shocking ravages and massacres. The full text of the note is as follows: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia extends its respects to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and makes the following representations regarding the persecution of overseas Chinese in Lombok:
    It has only recently come to light that overseas Chinese residing in various regions of Lombok have continuously suffered shocking ravages and massacres! Before the tragic incidents occurred, local Indonesian right-wing forces were clamoring everywhere, "to kill and exterminate all Chinese residing in Lombok," "to burn all Chinese houses and property." On the night of December 25, 1965, in Cakranegara Town, Lombok, a group of thugs suddenly broke into the residence of overseas Chinese Zhang Quanhou, killing Zhang Quanhou and his son Zhang Jinfang together. On the same night, hundreds of thugs rushed into the Ampenan city area, threatening the overseas Chinese and planning to poison and burn Chinese shops. On the morning of the 28th, hundreds more thugs in Masbagik looted and destroyed Chinese shops, while violently threatening the lives and safety of the overseas Chinese. More unfortunately, these atrocities escalated. On December 30th, in the East Lombok region, right-wing forces organized thugs, travelling by large trucks from Masbagik to Pancor, Selong, Tanjung Teros, Keruak, Aikmel, Apitaik, Pringgabaya, Peringga, Surralaga and other places, shouting slogans such as "Kill all Chinese," and launched a frenzied looting and destruction of overseas Chinese shops and residences, setting fire to houses and transportation vehicles. Nearly a thousand overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned affected areas and neighboring villages and towns have fled to Ampenan and Cakranegara due to displacement or threats to their lives, a truly tragic scene.
    What is especially heartbreaking is that in this atrocity, overseas Chinese who have always lived in harmony with the local Indonesian people, regardless of age or gender, were subjected to inhumane massacres, resulting in a tragic event that is unbearable to witness or hear! The wife of overseas Chinese Wu Yudian, who resided in Pancor, was pregnant and about to give birth. The thugs locked her and her six young children in their house and then set it on fire, burning the mother and seven children to death amidst cries for help! Zhang Zhongxiang and Zhang Meizhen, a newly married couple from Tanjung Teros, had the husband brutally murdered first, and then the wife was raped before being murdered! The wife of overseas Chinese Li Yuanchou in Surralaga had her ears and fingers cut off by thugs, who stole her earrings and rings before throwing her into the river to drown! Many other overseas Chinese were killed by thugs with sharp weapons, some were beheaded, some had their limbs chopped off, and some had their abdomens cut open and their organs removed. This once again exposed the true face of the right-wing thugs. Anyone with a shred of compassion cannot but be outraged by such cruel atrocities! Who cannot but be saddened by such tragic scenes?!
    According to incomplete statistics, over twenty overseas Chinese were killed on December 30th alone. In addition to the above-mentioned ten people in Pancor, Surralaga, and Tanjung Teros, there were Zhou Mingwu, Zhou Fulian and others in Lombok; Huang Detian, Kuang Caichang (female) and others in Apitaik; Lin Baji (female), Tang Changsan and others in Aikmel; Yu Junwei in Keruak; Yu Yaoyi, Qiu Liren and others in Tanjung Teros; In addition, dozens of overseas Chinese were beaten and injured, including six seriously injured who have been sent to the hospital for treatment, and several overseas Chinese women are missing, with their whereabouts unknown. Some overseas Chinese women were even abducted and forced to be concubines, subjected to enslavement and torture.
    From the above facts alone, it can be clearly seen to what cruel extent these bloody atrocities of ravaging and massacring overseas Chinese have reached! To what barbaric degree the crimes of racism have reached! To what unbridled trampling of international law and humanitarianism has been carried out! The facts irrefutably show that this is a heinous crime organized and planned by right-wing forces serving imperialism. The right-wing thugs cannot wash away this record of evil that they themselves have painted!
    The Chinese Embassy expresses its uncontainable indignation at this and lodges the strongest protest to the Indonesian government. The Embassy demands that the Indonesian government face up to the seriousness of this tragic event, severely punish the instigators and murderers, immediately provide compensation to the families of the victims, compensate for all losses suffered by the overseas Chinese, provide emergency relief and proper resettlement to the overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods and been displaced, and promptly investigate the whereabouts of the missing persons and protect them. The Embassy reiterates its demand that the Indonesian government take effective measures quickly to effectively guarantee the safety of the lives and property of the overseas Chinese and to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.
    The Chinese Embassy and Consulates are currently restricted and cannot fully understand the tragic persecution and comprehensive losses suffered by the overseas Chinese in this catastrophe for the time being, and the Embassy reserves the right to make further requests.
    With highest regards.
                           The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia
                              Jakarta, January 12, 1966

    龙目岛华侨惨遭印尼右派蹂躏和屠杀
    我向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议
    中国大使馆在照会中指出：这是为帝国主义效劳的右派势力有组织有计划制造出来的滔天罪行。要求印度尼西亚政府严惩主使者和凶手，立即抚恤死难者家属，赔偿华侨受到的一切损失。
    新华社十五日讯　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆一月十二日把一份照会交给印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒去年底对居住在龙目岛各地区的华侨进行骇人听闻的蹂躏和惨杀的血腥暴行，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚共和国外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆谨向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意，并就龙目岛所发生的迫害华侨事件，申述如下：
    最近始获悉，居住在龙目岛各地区的华侨，曾连续蒙受到骇人听闻的蹂躏和惨杀！在惨案未发生之前，当地印度尼西亚右派势力，即到处叫嚣“要杀尽斩绝居住在龙目岛的中国人”，“要烧掉所有中国人的房屋财产”。在一九六五年十二月二十五日夜间，龙目岛渣加拉镇，即有一群暴徒，突然闯进华侨张权厚的住宅，将张权厚及其子张锦芳一起杀死。同夜，有暴徒数百名冲入安班兰市区，对华侨进行了威胁，并打算下毒手焚烧华侨商店。二十八日上午，马士百格又有暴徒数百名，对华侨商店进行了抢劫和捣毁，同时，对华侨的生命安全，进行了凶恶的威胁。更不幸的是，这种暴行竟愈演愈烈。十二月三十日，在东龙目地区，右派势力有组织的暴徒，由马士百格分乘大卡车，驶往班卒、士隆、丹容地罗斯、内务亚式、亚以美、亚必打意、甫加丁、甫粦加、苏勒拉加等地，狂呼着“杀尽中国人”的种种口号，展开了向华侨商店、住宅的疯狂抢劫、捣毁，并纵火焚烧房屋和交通工具。上述受害地区和邻近村镇的华侨，因流离失所或受到生命威胁，已有近千人逃亡到安班兰和渣加拉两地，情景极为悲惨。
    尤其令人痛心的是：在这次暴行中，竟对一向同当地印度尼西亚人民和睦相处的华侨，不分老幼、妇女，进行了惨绝人寰的屠杀，造成了目不忍睹、耳不忍闻的大惨案！居住在班卒的华侨吴玉殿的妻子，正怀孕待产，暴徒将她和她的六个幼孩封闭于室内，然后纵火焚烧其房屋，母子七人在嚎啕呼救中被一起烧死！丹容地罗斯的华侨张忠祥、张美珍，是一对新婚夫妇，暴徒先惨杀掉丈夫，后奸污其妻子，然后又将她加以残杀！苏勒拉加的华侨李元稠的妻子，被暴徒割掉她的耳朵和手指，抢去她的耳环和戒指，然后又将她抛入河中淹死！其他许多华侨，被暴徒用利器杀死，有的被砍头颅，有的被斩四肢，有的被剖腹破脏，这又一次暴露了右派暴徒的真实面目。稍有恻隐之心者，对如此残忍暴行，能不为之愤恨？！对如此凄惨情景，能不为之悲痛？！
    据不完全的统计，仅十二月三十日被杀死的华侨即达二十余人之多。除上述班卒、苏勒拉加和丹容地罗斯的十人外，在龙目，有周明武、周福联等人；在亚必打意，有黄德添、邝彩嫦（女）等人；在亚以美，有林巴治（女）、汤长三等人；在内务亚式，有余均伟；在丹容地罗斯，有余燿义、丘礼忍等人；此外，有数十名华侨被殴受伤，其中六名重伤，已送医院抢救，另有多名华侨妇女失踪，至今生死不详。有的华侨妇女竟被劫去霸占，强迫为妾，遭受奴役折磨。
    仅从上述事实，可以清楚地看到，这种蹂躏屠杀华侨的血腥暴行，已达到何等残酷地步？！种族主义的罪行，已达到何等野蛮程度？！对国际公法和人道主义，已作了何等猖狂的践踏？！事实无可辩驳地表明：这是为帝国主义效劳的右派势力，有组织有计划制造出来的滔天罪行，右派暴徒自己涂下的这种罪恶记录，说什么也是洗脱不掉的！
    中国大使馆对此表示难以抑制的愤慨，并向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府正视这种惨案的严重性，严惩主使者和凶手，立即抚恤死难者的家属，赔偿华侨所受到的一切损失，对丧失生计、流离失所的华侨，进行紧急救济并给予妥善安置，对失踪者应即查明下落，加以保护。大使馆再次要求印度尼西亚政府迅速采取有效措施，切实保障华侨的生命财产的安全，并切实保证不再发生类似事件。
    中国大使馆、领事馆目前受到了限制，一时难以完全了解华侨在这一浩劫中受到的悲惨迫害和全面损失，大使馆保留进一步提出要求的权利。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
                           中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆
                              一九六六年一月十二日于雅加达
