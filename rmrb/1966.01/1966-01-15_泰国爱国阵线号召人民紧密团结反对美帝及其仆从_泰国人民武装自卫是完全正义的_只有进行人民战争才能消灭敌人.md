    Xinhua News Agency, January 14th - According to a broadcast by the Thai "Voice of the People" radio station on January 1st, the Patriotic Front of Thailand issued a letter to the nation on January 1st, exposing that U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous and dictatorial government are doing their utmost to turn Thailand into a military base for invading Southeast Asian countries, expanding the war to the entire Indochina, and intensifying the suppression of the Thai people. The letter to the nation calls on the Thai people to unite and resolutely wage a tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous and dictatorial government. The full text of the letter to the nation is as follows:
    Dear compatriots:
    On the occasion of the New Year 1966, first of all, the Patriotic Front of Thailand extends its best wishes to all patriotic compatriots.
    From January 1, 1965, to the present, the Patriotic Front of Thailand has been established for exactly one year. Over the past year, the development of the domestic and international situation has been very rapid, and extremely beneficial to the patriotic people, but very unfavorable to the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackey traitorous government. We can see that the wave of struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national freedom and to defend independence and democracy continues one after another. These struggles are mostly directed at the imperialists who promote new and old colonialism and the reactionary lackey governments, causing the imperialist aggressive forces and the reactionary lackey governments to be isolated and surrounded by the people of various countries.
    As for our Thailand, due to the occupation by U.S. imperialism and the transformation of Thailand into a new-type colony, as well as the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Thai people by the Thanom-Praphas traitorous and dictatorial government, the people have learned more from the real situation and have seen more clearly the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and the truth that the Thanom-Praphas government voluntarily acts as a U.S. imperialist slave, thereby increasingly arousing strong and widespread dissatisfaction and hatred among the Thai people towards U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas government. This dissatisfaction and hatred is expanding more and more rapidly, to the point of organized struggles of various kinds, from righteous petitions to publishing dissenting opinions in newspapers, workers holding protest strikes, students holding strikes, from marches and demonstrations to farmers in the Northeast and South rising up to oppose and resist armed suppression, and so on. In particular, since the Patriotic Front of Thailand announced its establishment on January 1, 1965, and published a program that meets the requirements of the country and the people, we have received widespread support and cooperation from compatriots, including individuals and groups, thus making the Patriotic Front of Thailand the center for uniting and promoting all patriotic forces to form a more solid force. It is gratifying that on November 1, 1965, the Thai Independence Movement officially announced its joining the Patriotic Front of Thailand as a group member. Before and after this, other patriotic organizations are also consulting and preparing to join the Patriotic Front of Thailand as group members in the near future. We express our warm welcome to this.
    In order to win the support of the people of the world who love justice, we sent Central Committee member Lieutenant Colonel Phayong Chulanon abroad to seek the sympathy of friends from various countries for the just struggle of the Thai people to save the motherland. In this regard, we have achieved great success. The Patriotic Front of Thailand, as an organization uniting all patriotic forces to fight for saving the Thai nation from the rule of U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous and dictatorial government, has been familiarized and recognized by the people of the world. In particular, in May 1965, the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference recognized the status of the Patriotic Front of Thailand and accepted the Patriotic Front of Thailand as a member. Therefore, the Patriotic Front of Thailand has taken root in international status. Our people's glorious struggle is linked to the struggle of the people of the world for justice and freedom, and will never be isolated.
    Conversely, the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous government, although seemingly powerful, are reactionary, anti-people, and unjust in nature. Therefore, they not only do not receive the support of their own people, but are also severely opposed and condemned by the people of the world who love justice, putting them in an isolated position. Especially the current U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam, although the United States has dispatched nearly 200,000 elite troops and a large number of sharp weapons to directly participate in the Vietnam War, it cannot defeat the Vietnamese people. Instead, the U.S. forces have been severely beaten and suffered heavy losses by the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, forcing the U.S. imperialist leader - Johnson to ask his allies to quickly send troops to save his position in Vietnam, but still unable to improve the situation of the United States in Vietnam. The prestige of U.S. imperialism has rapidly declined and will increasingly fall into the abyss of the Vietnam War. As for the situation of the Thanom-Praphas government, it is not much different from its master, and is in an extremely corrupt and crumbling state. It can be clearly seen that the voices of dissatisfaction, curses, and opposition to the Thanom-Praphas government from all classes and strata of the people have become louder and more widespread. The Thanom traitorous government believes that although the people are dissatisfied, they can use dictatorial power, use Article 17, and use the military and police to seal the mouths of the people and force the people to be their slaves. However, their Article 17, or dictatorial power, etc., are now ineffective, because the people do not believe or pay attention to these anymore. The people in some provinces in the Northeast, Central, and Southern regions have taken up arms to fight against the suppression and sweep of the Thanom-Praphas government, which is a sign that the doomsday of the Thanom-Praphas traitorous government is approaching.
    Under this situation, in order to change the situation that is unfavorable to them, U.S. imperialism is intensifying the dispatch of troops to occupy and control Thailand, turning Thailand into a military base for invading Southeast Asian countries, and trying its best to expand the war to the entire Indochina, dragging Thailand into the abyss of aggressive war together with U.S. imperialism. According to various evidence we have obtained, the United States and the Thanom-Praphas government have established a joint command in Thailand with Lieutenant General Richard Stilwell as chairman, and colluded with each other to plan to send Thai troops into Laos to expand the war, cooperate with the United States to expand the aggressive war in South Vietnam to North Vietnam, and create incidents on the Thai-Cambodian border in order to find an excuse to directly invade Cambodia. In order to ensure the smooth progress of their above-mentioned conspiracies, U.S. imperialism also instructed the Thanom-Praphas government to intensify the suppression of the people. The Thanom-Praphas government immediately served and announced that in the coming dry season, it would use the strength of the army and police to resolutely suppress and sweep the people. In this way, we can accurately predict that the entire Thailand will inevitably be in a state of war. Military budget will increase, and the Thai people will be subjected to heavier tax exploitation several times. Currency will be more inflated, and prices will be higher. This will make the poor people who were originally living a painful life even poorer and suffer greater hardship. More importantly, Thailand will become a battlefield, which will bring incalculable disasters to our beloved motherland.
    Dear compatriots: Thailand belongs to every Thai people, and we must cherish it. But as mentioned above, at present, our beloved motherland does not maintain independence as we once took pride in, but has completely become a new-type colony of U.S. imperialism under the collusion and cooperation between the Thanom-Praphas traitorous government and U.S. imperialism, leading Thailand to the road of destruction and demise. Compatriots, we cannot sit idly by and watch our beloved motherland perish like this. We must unite closely, regardless of gender, age, class, race, religion, party, and belief, and use various forms of activities as much as possible to struggle and stop the acts of U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous government that are planning to expand the war and madly suppress the people in the Northeast and other regions, which bring disaster to our country.
    Patriotic civil servants, soldiers, and police brothers: The Thanom-Praphas traitorous and dictatorial government's massacre of the people is using you as their most important tool. In fact, the people you are suppressing are your compatriots, those compatriots with a high degree of patriotism. If you suppress these people, it is equivalent to suppressing your uncles, brothers, and brothers in order to maintain the throne of the Thanom-Praphas government, allowing them to continue to betray the country, continue their dictatorial rule, and engage in corruption and malfeasance. At the same time, you will become criminals like them. This will only arouse the hatred of the broad masses of the people. For this reason, we call on you: do not act as a dirty tool of the Thanom-Praphas government anymore. Please turn around and join the broad masses of patriotic people to fight together to drive away U.S. imperialism and destroy its lackey - the Thanom-Praphas traitorous government, and to save our country from extinction.
    Patriotic brothers: The patriotic brothers in the Northeast are forced to rise up to wage armed self-defense struggles against the enemy's suppression, which is completely correct and just. Because at present, the enemy does not give us any right to speak. They only like to use guns to massacre, oppress, and bully the people, making the people restless. At this point, the only way is: our people must take up arms to wage a tit-for-tat struggle with the enemy, and only by expanding the people's armed struggle into a people's war can our country eliminate the enemy's armed forces and achieve final victory. Therefore, the urgent task facing patriotic brothers at present is to take various actions and fully support the armed struggle of patriotic brothers in the Northeast and other regions, and must make various forms and methods of struggle cooperate to gradually weaken the enemy's strength.
      Patriotic brothers: Let us unite and fight resolutely, and our just cause will surely be victorious.
    U.S. imperialism and the fascist dictatorial traitor government will surely perish.
    Long live the unity and struggle of the patriotic people!
    Long live the independence, democracy, and happiness of the Thai people!
                    The Patriotic Front of Thailand
                January 1, 1966

    泰国爱国阵线号召人民紧密团结反对美帝及其仆从
    泰国人民武装自卫是完全正义的  只有进行人民战争才能消灭敌人
    新华社十四日讯　据泰国“人民之声”电台一月一日广播，泰国爱国阵线一月一日发表了致全国同胞书，揭露美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府正在竭力把泰国变成侵略东南亚各国的军事基地，把战争扩大到整个印度支那，并且加紧镇压泰国人民。致全国同胞书呼吁泰国人民团结起来，坚决同美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府进行针锋相对的斗争。致全国同胞书全文如下：亲爱的同胞们：
    值此一九六六年新年之际，首先，泰国爱国阵线向全体爱国同胞致以良好的祝愿。
    自一九六五年一月一日到现在，泰国爱国阵线正好成立一周年。这一年来，国内外形势的发展很快，而且对爱国人民极为有利，但对美帝国主义侵略者及其仆从卖国政府却非常不利。我们可以看到亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民为争取民族自由和保卫独立、民主的斗争浪潮，一个接着一个地继续不断。这些斗争，大都是指向推行新老殖民主义的帝国主义者和反动仆从政府，使得帝国主义的侵略势力和反动的仆从政府陷于孤立，并处在各国人民的包围中。
    至于我们的泰国，由于美帝国主义的占领，并把泰国变成为新型殖民地，以及他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府对泰国人民所进行的残酷压迫和剥削，使人民从真实情况中得到了更多的教训，更清楚地看到美帝国主义的侵略面目和他侬—巴博政府自愿充当美帝国主义奴才的真相，从而日益激起泰国人民对美帝国主义和他侬—巴博政府的强烈和广泛的不满和憎恨。这种不满和憎恨越来越迅速扩展，以至有组织地进行了各式各样的斗争，即从正义的请愿到在报纸上发表反对意见，工人举行抗议罢工，学生举行罢课，从游行示威直至东北部和南部农民起来反对和抵抗武装镇压等等。尤其是一九六五年一月一日泰国爱国阵线宣布成立，并发表了符合国家人民要求的纲领以后，我们获得了同胞们，包括个人和团体的广泛支持和合作，因此，就使泰国爱国阵线成为团结和推动所有爱国力量结成更加坚固力量的中心。值得高兴的是，一九六五年十一月一日，泰国独立运动已经正式宣布加入泰国爱国阵线作为团体会员。在这前后，还有其他的爱国组织也在磋商，准备在不久的将来加入泰国爱国阵线作为团体会员。我们对此表示热烈地欢迎。
    为了争取全世界热爱正义的人民的支持，我们派遣中央委员帕荣·朱拉暖中校到国外去，以便寻求各国朋友对泰国人民拯救祖国的正义斗争的同情。在这方面，我们已经取得了很大的成就。泰国爱国阵线，作为联合一切爱国力量为拯救泰国民族摆脱美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府的统治而斗争的机构，已经被全世界人民所熟识和公认。尤其是一九六五年五月，第四届亚非人民团结大会已经承认泰国爱国阵线的地位并接受泰国爱国阵线为会员。因此，泰国爱国阵线在国际地位上，已扎下了根子。我国人民光荣的斗争同全世界人民争取正义和自由的斗争是连在一起的，决不会孤立。
    相反地，美帝国主义侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国政府，虽然貌似强大，但由于它们的本质是反动的、是反人民的、是非正义的，因此，它们不仅得不到本国人民的支持，而且还受到全世界热爱正义的人民的严厉反对和谴责，使它们处于孤立的地位。尤其目前美帝国主义对越南的侵略，美国虽然派遣了将近二十万的精兵和大量犀利武器，直接参与越南战争，也无法战胜越南人民，反而被越南人民武装力量打得头破血流，遭到了惨重的损失，迫使美帝国主义头子——约翰逊要向他的盟友请求赶快派兵挽救他在越南的地位，但仍无法改善美国在越南的处境。美帝国主义的威望已迅速下降而且将日益陷入越南战争的深渊里。至于他侬—巴博政府的处境也和它的主子没有什么不一样，正处在极端腐朽和摇摇欲坠的状况中。可以明显看到的是，各阶级各阶层人民对他侬—巴博政府的不满、诅咒和反对的呼声已越来越响亮，越来越广泛。他侬卖国政府认为：尽管人民不满，但他们可以用独裁权力，用第十七条规定和用军警来封住人民的嘴巴，逼迫人民当他们的奴隶。可是他们的第十七条规定，或独裁权力等等现在都已经失灵，因为人民不相信也不理睬这些了。东北部、中部和南部某些府的人民拿起了武器和他侬—巴博政府的镇压和扫荡进行斗争，正是他侬—巴博卖国政府的末日即将到来的征兆。
    在这种情况下，为了改变对它们不利的局势，美帝国主义加紧增派兵力占领和控制泰国，把泰国变成侵略东南亚各国的军事基地，竭力把战争扩大到整个印度支那，拉着泰国同美帝国主义一起掉进侵略战争的深渊里。根据我们得到的各种证据，美国和他侬—巴博政府已在泰国建立以理查德·史迪威少将为主席的联合指挥部，并互相勾结策划派遣泰国军队进入老挝扩大战争，配合美国把南越的侵略战争扩大到北越，以及在泰柬边境制造事件，以便为直接侵略柬埔寨寻找借口。为了使他们上述阴谋得以顺利进行，美帝国主义还指使他侬—巴博政府加紧镇压人民，他侬—巴博政府即连忙效劳，并宣布说：在这即将到来的旱季，要用军队和警察的力量对人民进行坚决的镇压和扫荡。这样一来，我们就能够准确地预料到，整个泰国将不可避免地要处于战争状态。军事预算将增加，泰国人民将受到更重几倍的赋税剥削。通货将更膨胀，物价将更高涨。这将使那些原来过着痛苦生活的贫困人民更加贫困和遭受更大的苦难。更重要的是，泰国将变成一个战场，这将给我们可爱的祖国带来不可估量的灾祸。
    亲爱的同胞们：泰国是我们每个泰国人民的，我们必须珍惜它。但正如上述所说的，目前，我们可爱的祖国并不象我们曾经引以为荣的那样保持独立，而是在他侬—巴博卖国政府同美帝国主义相互勾结和合作下，已经彻底地沦为美帝国主义的新型殖民地，他们将泰国引向毁灭和沦亡的道路。同胞们，我们不能眼看我们可爱的祖国这样沦亡下去而无动于衷。我们必须紧密地团结起来，不分性别、年龄、阶级、种族、宗教、党派和信仰，尽可能用各种各样活动形式来进行斗争和阻止美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国政府正在策划扩大战争和疯狂地镇压东北和其他地区人民而给我们国家带来灾难的行为。
    爱国的公务人员、军人和警察弟兄们：他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府对人民的屠杀，是利用你们作为他们最主要的工具。实际上你们所镇压的人民，正是你们的同胞，是那些具有高度爱国精神的同胞。如果你们对这些人民进行镇压，就等于你们为了维护他侬—巴博政府的宝座，让他们继续卖国，继续其独裁统治和贪污舞弊而对自己的叔、伯、兄、弟进行镇压。与此同时，你们也将和他们一样变成罪犯。这只有引起广大人民的憎恨。为此，我们向你们呼吁：不要再充当他侬—巴博政府的肮脏工具，请你们转过来和广大的爱国人民一起，共同为赶走美帝国主义和摧毁其仆从——他侬—巴博卖国政府，为拯救我们的国家免于灭亡而斗争。
    爱国的弟兄们：东北爱国弟兄被迫起来与敌人的镇压进行武装自卫斗争，是完全正确的和正义的。因为目前敌人不给我们任何的发言权，他们只喜欢用枪来屠杀、压迫和欺凌人民，使人民不得安宁。到此地步，唯一的道路就是：我们人民必须拿起武器同敌人展开以眼还眼、以牙还牙、针锋相对的斗争，而且只有把人民的武装斗争扩大成为人民的战争，我国才能够消灭敌人的武装力量，和取得最后的胜利。因此，目前摆在爱国弟兄们面前的紧迫任务就是，必须采取各种行动、全力地支援东北和其他地区爱国弟兄的武装斗争，必须使得各种各样的斗争形式和方法配合起来逐步削弱敌人的力量。
      爱国弟兄们：让我们团结一致，坚决斗争，我们正义的事业一定能够取得胜利。
    美帝国主义和法西斯独裁叛国政府一定灭亡。
    爱国人民的团结力量和斗争万岁！
    泰国人民的独立、民主和幸福万岁！
                    泰国爱国阵线
