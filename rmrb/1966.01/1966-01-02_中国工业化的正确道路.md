   Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Daqing have fully embodied the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and have embodied the path of China's industrialization pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.

   Daqing Oilfield started with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." This is a difficult problem to understand for some people. There is not a single word in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" that talks about oil extraction, nor a single word that talks about building an oil refinery. How can one start with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction"? The reason they cannot understand this is not because of anything else, but because they neither understand that Marxist theory is a guide to action, nor do they understand the truth that matter can be transformed into spirit and spirit can be transformed into matter.

   What is the path of China's industrialization?

   Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the direction for us in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." At the same time, he also emphasized: "There are contradictions on this question, namely, the contradiction between the objective laws of socialist economic development and our subjective understanding, which needs to be resolved in practice."

   To be resolved through practice! How to practice? One kind of practice is blind practice, which will lead to doing more work with less results, or even slower, poorer, and more expensive results. Another kind of practice is practice under the guidance of correct theory. The people of Daqing started with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," consciously using Marxist theory—Mao Zedong Thought—as a guide to action, and thus were able to gradually reflect objective contradictions correctly in practice and resolve them one by one through struggle.

   The imperialists and revisionists took advantage of the fact that we used to rely on foreign oil. Without changing this state of dependence, there would be no economic independence for China, and no industrialization for China. The huge needs of our country's economic development and the extreme backwardness of our country's oil industry formed a prominent contradiction.

   Foreign books say that China is a country poor in oil. If we believe in foreign books, we can only be content with the status quo, do nothing, and prostrate ourselves at the feet of imperialism and revisionism, living on their oil.

   This is a struggle against nature, a struggle to break superstitions, and even more a class struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The people of Daqing are treating this serious struggle with the determination to make revolution.

   Is China actually a country poor in oil? Through practice, the people of Daqing found a large oilfield, and the theory that China is poor in oil went bankrupt. The people of Daqing took down the large oilfield, we have our own oil, and the attempt by imperialism and revisionism to control us with foreign oil has failed shamefully.

   Oil is deeply buried in complex strata. What is the best way to extract it? In practice, the people of Daqing obtained and analyzed hundreds of thousands of rock samples, conducted millions of chemical tests, and tens of millions of stratigraphic comparisons, and through comprehensive research, they finally figured out the objective laws of the oilfield. If we do not grasp the primary source material and only think hard in the design institute, we will not be able to solve the problem of oilfield extraction. If we do not seriously analyze and comprehensively study a large amount of primary source material, it will be difficult to recognize the objective laws of the oilfield.

   When Daqing Oilfield began construction, the objective material conditions were very difficult. However, things are always divided into two, and difficulties can also be transformed. Daqing brought into play the only favorable condition—people. The Party armed the people of Daqing with Mao Zedong Thought, they had the motherland in their hearts, the world in their eyes, soaring ambitions, and the determination to smash the blockade of imperialism and revisionism, and worked practically, arduously, poorly, and skillfully. The greater the difficulties, the greater their enthusiasm. In this way, things were transformed. It took only three years to take down the large oilfield. If they had been intimidated by the difficulties at that time, there would be no Daqing Oilfield today.

   The deeds of the people of Daqing starting with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" cannot be fully written. In the process of developing the oilfield and building the oil refinery, "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" guided them to increasingly profoundly understand the laws of developing the oil industry, and practice increasingly profoundly helped them to understand "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Matter is transformed into spirit, and spirit is transformed into matter. They constantly summed up experience, constantly made discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced levels.

   Are Chinese people not capable? Is it impossible to live without relying on foreigners? These self-deprecating, worshipful ideas were swept away in Daqing. With Mao Zedong Thought, laymen can lead experts, and laymen can become experts. Daqing has grown into a strong army of the oil industry. What foreigners have done, we have done. What foreigners don't have, we have also done. The Chinese people are fully capable of building a modern socialist industry independently, with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

   Among the thousands of experiences of Daqing, the most fundamental one is to honestly act according to Mao Zedong Thought. Daqing's start with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" further powerfully proves that Mao Zedong Thought can not only manage revolution, but also manage construction. Mao Zedong Thought is a weapon to guide us to understand objective laws from practice, enabling us to correctly understand contradictions and resolve contradictions. Acting according to "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" means proceeding from reality and seeking truth from facts, that is, strictly acting according to the Marxist revolutionary and scientific epistemology, and we will be invincible.

   Mao Zedong Thought armed the people of Daqing, and the people of Daqing have red hearts, bright eyes, brave courage, hard bones, good thoughts, and a clear direction. When the masses are united, things are easy to handle. Mao Zedong Thought has become a huge material force, creating the miracle of our country's basic self-sufficiency in oil. The era when our country relied on foreign oil is gone forever.

   The people of Daqing started with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" because they had a clear viewpoint of class struggle and combined Mao Zedong Thought with the practice of developing the oil industry in the struggle. The people of Daqing started with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" also because they used the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to successfully analyze, study, and solve many problems in industrial construction. They created a model of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought creatively in socialist construction. The Daqing spirit and the rich experience gained by the people of Daqing are of universal significance.

### 中国工业化的正确道路

   中国工业化的正确道路
    在毛泽东思想指导下，大庆人全面体现了党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，体现了党中央和毛泽东同志指出的中国工业化的道路。
    大庆油田，“两论”起家。这对于有些人来说，是个难于理解的问题。《实践论》、《矛盾论》里，没有一个字谈到开采石油的问题，也没有一个字谈到建设炼油厂的问题，“两论”起家，从何说起。他们所以想不通，不是因为别的，而是由于他们既不懂得马克思主义的理论是指导行动的，又不懂得物质可以变精神、精神可以变物质这样一个真理。
    什么是中国工业化的道路？
    毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的文章中，给我们指出了方向。他同时还着重指出：“在这个问题上是存在着矛盾的，即社会主义经济发展的客观规律和我们主观认识之间的矛盾，这需要在实践中去解决。”
    要通过实践去解决！怎样去实践呢？一种实践是盲目的实践，这会导致事倍功半，甚至少慢差费。另一种实践是在正确的理论指导下的实践。大庆人从“两论”起家，自觉地用马克思主义理论——毛泽东思想作为行动的指南，因而能够逐步在实践中，正确地反映客观矛盾，通过斗争，一个一个加以解决。
    帝国主义和修正主义者就是欺负我们过去靠洋油过日子。不改变这种依赖状况，就没有中国的经济独立，就没有中国的工业化。发展我国经济的巨大需要同我国石油工业的十分落后，形成了一对突出的矛盾。
    洋书上说，中国是个贫油国。迷信洋书，我们就只能安于现状，无所作为，就只能匍伏在帝国主义和修正主义的脚下，靠他们的石油过活。
    这是一场同大自然的斗争，是一场破除迷信的斗争，更是一场反对帝国主义和修正主义的阶级斗争。大庆人正是抱着干革命的决心来对待这场严重的斗争的。
    中国究竟是不是贫油国？大庆人通过实践，找到了大油田，中国贫油论破产了。大庆人拿下了大油田，我们自己有了石油，帝国主义和修正主义用洋油控制我们的企图可耻地失败了。
    石油深深地埋在复杂的地层下面，怎样开采才是最好的办法？大庆人在实践中取得和分析了几十万个岩样，进行几百万次化验，几千万次地层对比，综合研究，终于摸清了油田的客观规律。如果不抓第一性资料，只在设计院里冥思苦想，就解决不了开采油田的难题。如果不去认真分析和综合研究大量的第一性资料，就将难于认识油田的客观规律。
    大庆油田开始建设的时候，客观物质条件是十分困难的。但是，事情总是一分为二的，困难同样可以转化。大庆就发挥了唯一的有利条件——人。党用毛泽东思想把大庆人武装起来，他们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，壮志凌云，决心粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的封锁，实干，苦干，穷干，巧干，困难越大，他们的干劲也越大。这样，事情就转化了。花了三年就拿下了大油田。如果他们当时被困难所吓倒，那么，就不会有今天的大庆油田。
    大庆人“两论”起家的事迹写不完。在开发油田、建设炼油厂的过程中，“两论”引导他们越来越深刻地认识到发展石油工业的规律，而实践又越来越深刻地帮助他们领会了“两论”。物质变精神，精神变物质。他们不断总结经验，不断有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，赶上和超过了世界先进水平。
    中国人不行吗？非靠洋人过日子不行吗？这些自卑的、崇洋的思想，在大庆一扫而光。有了毛泽东思想，外行可以领导内行，外行可以变成内行。大庆成长起一支坚强的石油工业的大军。外国人搞出来的，我们搞出来了。外国人没有的，我们也搞出来了。中国人完全能够自力更生、多快好省地建设社会主义的现代工业。
    大庆的经验，纵有千条万条，最根本的一条，就是老老实实地照毛泽东思想办事。大庆“两论”起家，进一步有力地证明了：毛泽东思想不仅可以管革命，而且同样可以管建设。毛泽东思想是指导我们从实践中去认识客观规律的武器，使我们能够正确地认识矛盾，解决矛盾。照着《实践论》、《矛盾论》办事，就能够从实际出发，实事求是，也就是严格地按照马克思主义的革命的科学的认识论办事，无往而不胜。
    毛泽东思想武装了大庆人，大庆人心红，眼亮，胆壮，骨头硬，思想好，方向明。群众齐心了，事情就好办了。毛泽东思想变成了巨大的物质力量，创造出我国石油基本自给的奇迹。我国靠洋油过日子的时代，一去不复返了。
    大庆人“两论”起家，是由于他们具有明确的阶级斗争的观点，在斗争中把毛泽东思想同发展石油工业的实践结合起来。大庆人“两论”起家，也是由于他们运用了辩证唯物主义的观点，成功地分析、研究、解决了工业建设中许多问题。他们创立了在社会主义建设中活学活用毛泽东思想的范例。大庆精神和大庆人所取得的丰富经验，是具有普遍意义的。
