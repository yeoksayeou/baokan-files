    Marine Corps Commandant Greene has asked the American people to "show courage and a spirit of sacrifice in the face of the increasing number of casualty lists." It seems that this merchant of death has foreseen the ominous prospect of increasingly heavy casualties among the invading American troops in Vietnam, and is worried that this will arouse the increasingly strong resentment of the American people.
    In fact, the "increasing number of casualty lists" of the invading American troops in Vietnam are indeed constantly inspiring more and more Americans to devote themselves to the struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam, and to show greater and greater courage.

    意在言外
    美国海军陆战队司令格林要求美国人民，“在人数日益增多的伤亡名单面前拿出勇气和牺牲精神”。看来，这个死亡贩子已预见到侵越美军伤亡日益惨重的不妙前景，并且担心将因此而激起美国人民日益强烈的愤懑。
    事实上，侵越美军的“人数日益增多的伤亡名单”的确不断在激发着美国人民越来越多地投身于反对侵越战争的斗争，并表现出越来越大的勇气。
