    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 11th. The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Presidium of the People's Assembly, the Council of Ministers, and the Tirana Municipal Committee of the Albanian Labor Party jointly held a grand meeting in Tirana on the evening of the 10th to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Albania.
    Albanian party and state leaders Hoxha, Shehu, Leshi, and others attended the celebration.
    Leshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, spoke at the meeting. He first reviewed the great achievements made by the Albanian people in the past twenty years. He pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers attempted to subdue the Albanian Labor Party and the people, and to lead them away from the correct path of socialist revolution and the path of Marxism-Leninism, using every means to undermine the smooth implementation of Albania's Third Five-Year Plan. But their sinister attempts failed shamefully. Under the correct and wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and with the support of fraternal socialist countries, especially the People's Republic of China, it was possible to successfully complete Albania's entire Third Five-Year Plan. At present, the Albanian people are enthusiastically striving to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
    He also exposed the "fabrications" and preachings of modern revisionists, saying that from now on it is necessary to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and replace it with a "state of the whole people," etc. He said that all this is a wanton distortion of Marxism-Leninism regarding the essence and role of the socialist state, and is an attempt to serve the imperialists, causing unprecedented damage to socialism.
    He then talked about Albania's foreign policy. He emphasized that the People's Republic of Albania has consistently pursued a policy of maintaining normal relations with countries with different social systems, especially with neighboring countries, on the basis of complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs; at the same time, it also pursues a policy of resolutely fighting against imperialism, especially US imperialism and other reactionaries, and a policy of uncompromisingly and resolutely exposing the aggressive and war-mongering plans of imperialism and its lackeys, because this is the primary factor in maintaining peace and international security.
    When talking about the international situation, Leshi severely condemned the barbarous war waged by the US imperialists against the heroic Vietnamese people and the interventions in Dominica, Congo (Leopoldville), Laos, Cambodia, and many other countries. He emphasized that despite the efforts of the US imperialist aggressors and their lackeys, they will never be able to subdue the people of all countries, and will never be able to extinguish the ideals of fighting for freedom.
    When exposing the sham anti-imperialist behavior of modern revisionists, Leshi said that what distinguishes the new Soviet leaders from Khrushchev is that they use extremely insidious and cunning deceptive methods, use false revolutionary words and "Marxist" and "anti-imperialist" words, and try every possible means to cover up their pro-imperialist revisionist policies, cover up their close cooperation with US imperialism, and their betrayal of the interests of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. They try to create the impression that they are correcting Khrushchev's "boasting" and "subjectivist" practices, but in fact they are implementing Khrushchev's line of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU without any change, and promoting the revisionist line of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful economic competition," and "peaceful transition to socialism." Not only that, but they also vowed to faithfully follow this line.
    Leshi then said that the life of this trick of the new Soviet leaders will not be long, and the mask has been torn off. Revolutionary experience and reality have exposed the deceptive and treacherous essence of their line, which has been opposed by the people of all countries and all revolutionary anti-imperialist forces. He also pointed out that the "holy alliance" of imperialism and revisionism is being exposed by the people of all countries, and their failure is inevitable. No matter how hard the imperialists and modern revisionists try, no matter what conspiracies they play and what nuclear blackmail they carry out, and what tricks they plot to sell out the revolutionary struggle, they cannot stop the great development of the revolutionary struggle. The great revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries at present foreshadow the death of imperialism and modern revisionism.
    Leshi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. The slogans "Enver Hoxha" and "Labor Party" resounded throughout the venue.
    After the celebration, a wonderful artistic program was performed.

    列希主席在庆祝共和国成立二十周年大会上说
    帝国主义和修正主义阻止不了世界革命
    革命经验和现实揭穿苏联领导的路线的欺骗性和背叛实质
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、人民议会主席团、部长会议和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党地拉那市委会，十日晚联合在地拉那举行大会，隆重庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立二十周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人霍查、谢胡、列希等都出席了庆祝会。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希在大会上讲了话。他首先回顾了阿尔巴尼亚人民在二十年中所取得的伟大成就。他指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者企图使阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民屈服，使之离开社会主义革命的正确道路，离开马克思列宁主义道路，为了破坏阿尔巴尼亚的第三个五年计划的顺利实现而无所不用其极。但是他们的恶毒企图可耻地失败了。在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确和英明领导下，并且得到社会主义兄弟国家、首先是中华人民共和国的支持，使阿尔巴尼亚整个第三个五年计划有可能得以顺利完成。目前阿尔巴尼亚人民正热情洋溢地为完成第四个五年计划而奋斗。
    他还揭露了现代修正主义者的“捏造”和说教，说什么从现在起必须取消无产阶级专政，以“全民国家”代替无产阶级专政等等。他说，所有这一切都是对马克思列宁主义关于社会主义国家的实质和作用的肆意歪曲，是在竭力为帝国主义者效劳，给社会主义造成了史无前例的损害。
    他接着谈到阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策。他强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一贯奉行在完全平等、互相尊重和互不干涉内政的基础上同社会制度不同的国家，首先是同邻国保持正常关系的政策；同时也奉行同帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义和其他反动派进行坚决斗争的政策，奉行毫不妥协和坚决地揭露帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和好战计划的政策，因为这是维护和平和国际安全的首要因素。
    列希在谈到国际形势时，严厉谴责美帝国主义者对英雄的越南人民进行的野蛮战争和对多米尼加、刚果（利）、老挝、柬埔寨以及其他许多国家进行的干涉。他强调指出，尽管美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗作出了努力，但他们永远压不倒各国人民，永远扑灭不了为争取自由而斗争的理想。
    列希在揭露现代修正主义者的假反帝行为时说，苏联新领导人不同于赫鲁晓夫的是，他们用极其阴险狡猾的骗人手法，用假革命的词句以及“马克思主义的”和“反帝”的词句，千方百计地掩盖他们亲帝国主义的修正主义政策，掩盖他们同美帝国主义的亲密合作以及他们对社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动利益的背叛。他们竭力造成一种印象，好象他们正在纠正赫鲁晓夫的“虚夸”和“主观主义”的做法，而事实上他们是在丝毫不变地执行苏共二十大和二十二大的赫鲁晓夫方针，推行“和平共处”、“和平经济竞赛”和“和平过渡到社会主义”的修正主义路线。不仅如此，他们还发誓要忠实地奉行这条路线。
    列希接着说，但是苏联新领导人的这种花招的寿命也是长不了的，假面具已经被撕破了。革命的经验和现实揭穿了他们路线的欺骗性和背叛的实质，这一路线遭到世界各国人民和所有革命的反帝力量的反对。他并指出，帝国主义和修正主义的“神圣联盟”正被各国人民所揭露，他们的失败是不可避免的。不管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者如何枉费心机，不管他们玩弄什么阴谋和进行原子讹诈，策划什么诡计来出卖革命斗争，他们都不可能阻止革命斗争的巨大发展。目前各国人民的伟大革命斗争预示着帝国主义和现代修正主义的死亡。
    列希的讲话一再为热烈的掌声所打断。“恩维尔·霍查”、“劳动党”的口号声响彻全场。
    庆祝会结束后，演出了精彩的文艺节目。
