    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: This year, public security departments in various places, in the Love-the-People Month campaign, have all emphasized highlighting politics, taking the education of public security cadres and police to serve the people wholeheartedly and rely on the masses to do public security work as the main content of the Love-the-People Month campaign.
    When the Love-the-People Month campaign began, public security departments in various places universally organized cadres and police to study Chairman Mao's three articles: "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," as well as the Eight Disciplines and Ten Points for Attention for Public Security Personnel, and conducted education on serving the people wholeheartedly for cadres and police. Leading cadres at all levels of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Department, in addition to taking the lead in studying, also divided up the work to go to grassroots units to explain the Eight Disciplines and Ten Points for Attention for Public Security Personnel to cadres and police, organized discussion sessions, conducted comparison and self-examination with problems in mind, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and deeply carried out the Love-the-People movement. In addition to requiring veteran police officers to model adherence to policies and discipline, urban public security departments in Jilin Province also gathered new police officers to explain the Eight Disciplines and Ten Points for Attention for Public Security Personnel, calling on everyone to consciously carry out Love-the-People activities and do more good things for the masses. Public security departments at all levels in Shaanxi Province generally summarized experiences, promoted advantages, identified gaps, and overcame shortcomings in terms of policy implementation, mass work, and police-people relations. This laid a good ideological foundation for deeply carrying out the Love-the-People Month campaign.
    During the Love-the-People Month campaign, public security personnel in various places held police-people symposiums to report on their work and widely solicit opinions. The director of the Xianyang Public Security Bureau in Shaanxi Province and the directors of many county public security bureaus under its jurisdiction participated in symposiums in streets and production teams to solicit opinions. Cadres and police of the public security departments of Xi'an, Baoji, and Weinan areas conducted investigations and visits among workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, collecting many valuable opinions. Public security bureaus in various counties in Hunan Province sent people to the areas where the police often work to hold mass symposiums and pay door-to-door visits to collect criticisms. The Xinjiang Public Security Department organized a discipline inspection team to conduct in-depth visits to rural and pastoral areas. Many public security organs also convened symposiums with representatives from fraternal departments or resident organs, factories, and other units to study each criticism raised and rectify them seriously.
    During the Love-the-People Month campaign, the broad masses of public security personnel launched activities to do good things for the masses. Some areas organized cadres and police to deliver fertilizer to communes, dig ditches to clear waterways, and repair bridges and roads; some combined safety inspections to eliminate fire hazards for the masses; and some helped the masses find relatives and friends and search for lost items. Li Ziying, director of the Political Department of the Sichuan Provincial Public Security Department, led more than 170 cadres to help suburban communes improve 11 mu of soil after the Love-the-People Month campaign began. Dozens of cadres from the Cangzhou Public Security Office in Hebei braved the severe cold to dig more than 600 cartloads of pit mud for the Changzhuanhe Production Team and delivered it to the fields. They also sent more than 450 copies of Chairman Mao's works and Wang Jie's diary to this production team, helping to establish a library. During the Love-the-People Month campaign, public security cadres and police in Ningqiang County, Shaanxi Province, together with cadres from other departments, built a river embankment 1.5 meters high, 2 meters wide, and 20 meters long for rural people's communes, expanding the irrigated area of farmland. Police officers in Yan'an County often gave haircuts and washed clothes for retired Red Army veterans in the "August 1st" Nursing Home, doing many good things. The Red Army veterans praised them, saying: "You have truly inherited the old traditions of the Red Army and are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Since the launch of the Love-the-People Month campaign, six public security sub-bureaus in Shenyang City have actively sought relatives and friends for the masses, rescued the dying and healed the wounded, and helped families of revolutionary martyrs and the "five guarantees" households solve their living difficulties, doing more than 900 good deeds of various kinds for the masses.
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 16th: Recently, during the annual Love-the-People Month of the People's Public Security Forces, extensive activities to support the government and cherish the people have been carried out.
    Many units organized cadres and soldiers to visit local areas, invited local cadres to introduce the advanced deeds of the people in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, as well as the new atmosphere after socialist education in urban and rural areas, setting off a wave of learning from the local areas. A unit stationed in Beijing invited Liu Ruitian, secretary of the Baiyun Stone Workshop Party Branch of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, to introduce their experience in going deep into the grassroots. Each company immediately conveyed and discussed it, determined to learn their good experience and strengthen company construction. Another unit sent five soldiers to the Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing, a red banner unit on the national commercial front, to learn from their experience. As soon as the soldiers entered the department store, they were moved by the scene of the salespersons warmly receiving customers. After returning to the company, everyone did their duties like the salespersons of Tianqiao Department Store, which was praised by the masses. The Public Security Team of Pingshan County, Hebei Province, had not made rapid progress in its work in recent years. With problems in mind, they visited the Dazhai-style production team of Nan Gunlonggou, found the gaps, and drew up a plan, expressing that in the new year, they would take the people of Nan Gunlonggou as an example, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, and strive to leap into the ranks of the "Four Good" companies. The public security fighters who braved the severe cold to learn from the Daqing Oilfield humbly learned and asked questions carefully, bringing the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people back to the troops, promoting various tasks.
    During this period, many units also actively helped people's communes in their stationed areas to run clubs and cultural rooms, and used various forms to publicize Mao Zedong Thought to the people. While helping the local people's commune establish a study room, a certain unit took advantage of the intervals of working with the masses to study Chairman Mao's works together and improve the class consciousness of the commune members. A certain unit of the Public Security Forces stationed in Handan, Hebei Province, sent a batch of single copies of Chairman Mao's works to the production team while sending people to help the production team level the land. The commune members said: You not only help us with labor, but also send us Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary spirit.
    In recent days, public security forces in various places have drawn a large amount of manpower and material resources to support communes and factories and enterprises in building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, turning the land, transporting materials, and doing good deeds. Not long ago, more than 700 people from a unit stationed in Beijing went to the Jingmi Water Diversion Project construction site and worked intensively for 15 days. During the Love-the-People Month, the troops stationed in Jingxi area on the southwestern border also sent medical personnel to treat commune members. The local people of all ethnic groups praised them for doing everything for the people and loving the people everywhere. (Attached picture)

    为人民　靠人民　做好公安工作
    各地公安人员深入开展爱民月运动
    据新华社十七日讯　今年，各地公安部门在爱民月运动中，都强调突出政治，把教育公安干部和民警全心全意为人民服务、依靠人民群众做公安工作，作为爱民月运动的主要内容。
    各地公安部门在爱民月运动开始的时候，都普遍组织干部和民警学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》三篇文章，学习了公安人员八大纪律十项注意，对干部和民警进行全心全意为人民服务的教育。上海市公安部门的各级领导干部除带头学习外，还分工分片到基层单位向干部、民警宣讲公安人员八大纪律十项注意，组织座谈讨论，带着问题以毛泽东思想为指针，进行对照检查，深入开展爱民运动。吉林省各城市公安部门除要求老民警模范地遵守政策、纪律以外，还分别把新民警召集起来，讲解公安人员八大纪律十项注意，号召大家自觉地开展爱民活动，为群众多办好事。陕西省各级公安部门普遍从执行政策、群众工作和警民关系等方面，总结经验，发扬优点，找出差距，克服缺点。为深入开展爱民月运动打下了良好的思想基础。
    各地公安人员在爱民月运动中，都召开了警民座谈会，向群众报告工作，广泛征求意见。陕西省咸阳公安处处长及所属许多县公安局局长，都到街道和生产队参加座谈会，征求意见。西安市和宝鸡、渭南专区公安部门的干部和民警，到工人和贫下中农社员中调查访问，搜集了很多宝贵的意见。湖南省各县公安局派人到民警经常活动的地区，召开群众座谈会和登门访问，搜集批评意见。新疆公安厅组织纪律检查组，深入农村和牧区访问。不少公安机关还召集兄弟部门或驻地机关、工厂等单位代表举行座谈会，对于各方面提出的批评意见逐件研究，并且认真整改。
    在爱民月运动中，广大公安人员开展了为群众办好事的活动。有的地区组织干部和民警给公社送肥，挖渠通沟，修桥补路；有的结合安全检查为群众消除火险；还有的为群众寻亲觅友，查找失物。四川省公安厅政治部主任李子英，在爱民月运动开始后，带领一百七十多名干部，帮助郊区公社改良土壤十一亩。河北沧州公安处数十名干部，冒着凛冽的寒风，为常砖河生产队挖了六百多车坑泥，并送到地里。他们还送给这个生产队毛主席著作、王杰日记等书籍四百五十多本，帮助建立了一个图书室。陕西省宁强县公安干部和民警在爱民月运动中，同其他部门的干部一起，为农村人民公社修成一道高一米五、宽二米、长二十米的河堤，扩大了农田灌溉面积。延安县的民警经常为“八一”敬老院的退休老红军理发，洗衣服，办了不少好事。老红军赞扬说：“你们是真正把红军的老传统继承下来了，真是毛主席的好战士。”沈阳市有六个公安分局从展开爱民月运动以来，积极为群众寻亲访友、救死扶伤，帮助烈军属、五保户解决生活困难，共为群众办了各种好事九百多件。
    据新华社十六日讯　最近，人民公安部队一年一度的爱民月里，广泛开展了拥政爱民活动。
    许多部队组织干部、战士到地方参观访问，请地方干部介绍人民群众在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中的先进事迹和城乡社会主义教育后的新气象，掀起了向地方学习的热潮。驻京部队某部请石景山钢铁公司白云石车间党支部书记刘瑞田介绍了他们深入基层的经验，各个连队立即进行了传达讨论，决心把他们的好经验学到手，加强连队建设。另一个部队派了五名战士到全国商业战线上的红旗单位北京市天桥商场取经。战士们一进商场，就被售货员热情接待顾客的情景所感动。回连之后，大家象天桥商场售货员那样，做执勤工作，受到群众的赞扬。河北平山县公安队几年来工作进步不够快，他们带着问题，访问了大寨式生产队南滚龙沟，找到了差距，订出了计划，表示要在新的一年里，以南滚龙沟人民为榜样，认真学习毛主席著作，争取跃入四好连队的行列。冒着严寒到大庆油田取经的公安战士们，虚心学，细心问，把大庆人的革命精神带回部队，促进了各项工作。
    这期间，许多部队还积极帮助驻地人民公社办俱乐部、文化室，运用各种形式向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想。某部在帮助当地人民公社建立学习室的同时，利用与群众一起劳动的间隙，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，提高社员的阶级觉悟。驻河北省邯郸公安部队某部，在派人帮助生产队平整土地时，送了一批毛主席著作单行本给生产队。社员们说：你们不仅帮助我们劳动，还给我们送来了毛泽东思想，送来了革命精神。
    连日来，各地公安部队抽出大批人力、物力，支援公社和工厂企业兴修水利，积肥翻地，运送物资，大办好事。不久前，驻京部队某部七百多人开赴京密引水工程工地，紧张劳动十五天。驻守西南边境靖西地区的部队，在爱民月中，还派出医务人员为社员治病，当地各族人民赞扬他们事事为人民，处处爱人民。（附图片）
