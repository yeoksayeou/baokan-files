    Striding Forward on the Road to High Yield: The Suzhou Special District
    With Bodies by Taihu Lake
    And Hearts with All of China

    The people of Suzhou Special District in Jiangsu Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are farming for the revolution and using scientific methods, resulting in a substantial increase in grain production for four consecutive years. In 1965, the entire district also achieved a bumper harvest of cotton. There was also a relatively large development in oil crops, silkworm cocoons, live pigs, and other diversified operations throughout the district. The total output value of diversified operations increased by more than 30% compared to 1964.

    The Suzhou Special District is located on the shores of Taihu Lake in Jiangnan and is one of China's important commodity grain bases. Here, lakes are dense, the soil is fertile, and the natural conditions are relatively favorable, but before liberation, dikes were in disrepair, river ports were silted up, and floods and droughts occurred frequently. After liberation, especially after communization, the people of Suzhou vigorously repaired dikes and weirs, dredged rivers and built embankments, opened canals and ditches, connected weirs and built sluice gates, increased mechanical drainage and irrigation equipment, and built electric drainage and irrigation projects. From the early days of liberation to 1962, the earthwork for water conservancy projects alone totaled more than 340 million cubic meters, thereby basically eliminating the threat of drought and greatly reducing the damage from floods. More than 80% of the district's farmland has achieved electromechanical drainage and irrigation, laying the foundation for stable and high yields.

    In 1962, the people of Suzhou Special District, with their indomitable revolutionary spirit, overcame Typhoon No. 14 and the floods and torrential rains that were rare for decades, increasing grain production by nearly 20% compared to the previous year.

    In 1963, the grain and cotton output of the entire district exceeded the highest level in history.

    At this time, some people were discussing: "The output is not low, the contribution is not small, and we can give an account to both our superiors and subordinates." "With such a high output, it would be good enough to maintain it in the future."

    Should we be satisfied with the "passable" status quo, or continue the revolution, produce more, and make greater contributions to the country?

    With the unfolding of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, with the deepening of the socialist education movement, and with the vigorous rise of the competition to learn from, catch up with, help, and surpass each other, the people of Suzhou stood taller and saw farther. They said: Farmers cannot only see the small world under their noses, cannot be satisfied with the status quo, but should stand by Taihu Lake and see Tiananmen.

    Therefore, in 1964, a new situation of large-scale promotion of improved rice varieties, major reforms in cropping systems, and great improvements in cultivation techniques emerged in the Suzhou Special District, and another big step was taken on the road to higher and higher yields: grain production increased by more than 20%, cotton production increased by more than 40%, oil crops increased by more than 60%, and the total output value of diversified operations increased by more than 30%.

    At this time, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee promptly instructed the Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee: "After a substantial increase in production, there are often two different attitudes: one is complacency, pride, and stagnation, in which case even the achievements already made are difficult to consolidate; the other is to use a dialectical viewpoint of one divides into two, seeing both achievements and shortcomings, continuing to strive for self-improvement, continuously revolutionizing, and continuously moving forward."

    In 1965, leaders at all levels, the vast number of cadres, and the peasant masses in the Suzhou area used the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution as a yardstick to demand more of themselves, break down the ideological sprouts of complacency and self-satisfaction, and examine their achievements in light of the needs of national construction and development, establishing new goals. In this way, the Suzhou Special District has been constantly advancing on the road of high agricultural yields, and its contribution to the country has been increasing. In 1964, it provided the state with 2.13 billion catties of commodity grain and nearly 700,000 dan of cotton, and also provided a large amount of other industrial raw materials and living materials for the state and the market. The contribution to the country in 1965 was even greater than in 1964.

      Establish Models to Lead the Whole Area
          The Road to Scientific Farming is Wide

    The people of Suzhou have always been known far and wide for their intensive cultivation. Since 1963, Suzhou has adopted the method of establishing models to lead the whole area to promote Chen Yongkang's high-yield rice experience, and the degree of intensive cultivation has been raised to a higher level.

    This year, in the spring, special districts, counties, and communes established more than 240 demonstration base points for learning and promoting Chen Yongkang's experience in various types of areas. These base points were all "three-way combinations" of leading cadres, peasant masses, and agricultural scientific and technical personnel. From rice seedling cultivation, land preparation, and planting, to field water and fertilizer management, the demonstration points personally controlled by Chen Yongkang first set an example, and then organized leading cadres and technicians from county and commune demonstration points to visit the site, and then the demonstration points at all levels carried out chain demonstrations, organizing cadres and members of surrounding communes and teams to observe on the spot. Seeing is believing, and with living models, the farmers understand at a glance, learn at a glance, and understand at a listen. In the first year, Chen Yongkang's set of advanced technologies, such as cultivating strong seedlings, reasonable close planting, shallow water and frequent irrigation, and timely fertilization, were applied and promoted to varying degrees in thousands of villages and teams. This year, the rice yield per mu in the entire district increased by 17% compared to the previous year, while the rice yield per unit area of the demonstration points at all levels was generally about 10% higher than that of the surrounding communes and teams with roughly the same conditions. Due to the leadership's call and the demonstration impact of these base points, a mass scientific experiment activity centered on learning and promoting Chen Yongkang's high-yield rice experience quickly unfolded vigorously in the Suzhou Special District, promoting the continuous improvement of rice cultivation techniques. In the past two or three years, the various links of rice production, from transplanting seedlings to field water and fertilizer management in the middle and later stages, have been effectively reformed, promoting the annual improvement of rice cultivation level and the continuous increase of rice production.

    The popularization and promotion of Chen Yongkang's experience has made people greatly taste the sweetness of scientific farming. Therefore, in 1964, the method of establishing models to promote Chen Yongkang's experience was further popularized throughout the district. At the same time, the models also developed from planting rice to planting various crops such as cotton, three wheats, rapeseed, and green manure, and gradually developed from simple agricultural management to diversified operations. The scope of the models also developed from small models of hundreds of mu and thousands of mu to large models of tens of thousands of mu and tens of thousands of mu.

    Scientific rice planting yields high; scientific wheat planting turns the tables. The cadres and masses in the Suzhou area, along the road of intensive cultivation and scientific farming, have made the original high-yield rice even higher, and gradually led the original low-yield three wheats to the road of high yield. In the past, wheat, which has always been called "small ripe," has never had a high yield. However, because people carried forward the same revolutionary spirit as planting rice, and extensively promoted Changshu County's Ni Yongfu's set of high-yield three-wheat experiences, such as thin-slice deep plowing, fine selection of improved varieties, deep ditch and high ridge, broad ridge and dense planting, and meticulous management, and also adopted measures such as heavy application of winter fertilizer and early application of seedling fertilizer to promote early emergence of seedlings and early tillering, as a result, the entire district's three wheats increased by more than 30% in 1965, and there also appeared counties with a yield of more than 300 catties per mu, communes with more than 400 catties, production teams with more than 500 catties, and high-yield fields with 700 or 800 catties.

    Striving for Balanced Increase in Production on One Hand
    Promoting New Imbalances on the Other

    In the autumn of 1963, the Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee, in summarizing and checking the agricultural production situation of the year, found that although the grain and cotton production of the entire district had exceeded the highest level in history, there were still a considerable number of low-yield areas, low-yield teams, and low-yield fields. Statistics showed that the unit yield of grain and cotton in low-yield fields, which accounted for one-fifth of the total farmland area in the entire district, was generally 20-30% lower than the average level in the entire district. Although the area of "three lows" was small, the potential for increasing production was huge. Therefore, the Prefectural Party Committee put forward the task of transforming the "three lows" to the people of the entire district.

    There are two types of low-yield fields: one is scattered and widely distributed, in low-yield communes and teams, and in high-yield communes and teams; the other is in pieces, concentrated in more than 20 communes in the Yangcheng Lake polder area. At the beginning, cadres and the masses in the two types of areas lacked confidence in transforming the "three lows." In high-yield areas with fewer low-yield fields, some people thought that "the area is small, there is little profit, and we cannot lose the watermelon to pick up sesame seeds"; in low-lying polder areas with more low-yield fields, some people thought that "the area is large, there are many difficulties, and it cannot be changed without national help."

    What attitude should be taken towards the "three lows"? Each commune and each team, cadres and members, combined their discussions on these issues one by one when summarizing the production experience of the year and planning the production for the coming year. After the situation was presented and the detailed accounts were calculated, people's ideological understanding was improved. The Likou Commune in Wu County has more than 30,000 mu of rice, and this year's average yield per mu was 634 catties, an increase of more than 20% compared to the previous year. However, after ranking, there were 6,562 mu of low-yield fields with a single yield of 400-500 catties in the entire commune; after calculating, as long as the rice yield of these fields is increased to the average level of 1965 in the next year, the entire commune can increase grain production by 850,000 catties, which is equivalent to increasing the rice yield per mu in the entire commune by 30 catties. After calculating this account, the cadres and masses unanimously believed that low-yield fields "sesame seeds are small, but there is a lot of profit," and striving for a balanced increase in the production of arable land in the entire district is an important way to further improve crop yields. Therefore, everyone actively took action.

    In 1964, Party organizations at all levels in the Suzhou Special District, on the one hand, armed cadres and the masses with the spirit of Dazhai to stimulate the determination of cadres and the masses in low-yield teams to strive for self-improvement, and on the other hand, sent nearly 2,000 cadres to squat in low-yield teams for a long time, to find the causes of low yields and study transformation measures together with the masses. In one year, more than 8,500 of the 10,500 low-yield teams in the entire district initially changed their low-yield appearance; 500,000 mu of the 1.5 million mu of low-yield fields in the entire district increased grain production by more than 30%, some doubled, and the yield of the remaining 1 million mu also increased to varying degrees.

    This year, while transforming the "three lows," a large number of high-yield and higher-yield models emerged from the model points at all levels throughout the district: 64 communes had an average single rice yield of more than 800 catties; 10 communes had an average single yield of more than 120 catties of lint cotton; more brigades and production teams broke through 1,000 catties of rice and 150 catties of lint cotton. With the improvement of the overall production level and the emergence of a large number of high-yield and higher-yield models, the old "three lows" have changed, and new "three lows" have emerged.

    Grain and cotton production has made a big leap forward, and diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline have lagged behind. At the beginning of 1964, the Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee put forward the goal of "guaranteed harvest in water and drought, stable increase in production, diversified operations, and comprehensive development."

    Striving for balanced increase in production on one hand, and actively promoting new imbalances on the other. In this way, wave after wave, one wave higher than the other, pushing the agricultural production level of the entire Suzhou Special District higher year after year.

    The Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee has realized that transforming the "three lows" on one hand and cultivating high-yield models on the other is an important leadership method that should be implemented for a long time to promote the continuous development of agricultural production in accordance with the law of unbalanced development of things and with the spirit of continuous revolution.

    At present, leaders at all levels and the vast number of cadres and masses in the Suzhou area, after achieving another bumper harvest in 1965, under the slogan of "learning from Dazhai and catching up with Shanghai (suburbs)," are continuing to use this experience with the spirit of "finding shortcomings after winning a battle," comparing high-yield models to find loopholes, comparing advanced to find gaps, summing up the experience of high-yield and higher-yield, checking and analyzing the causes of the new "three lows," looking for new ways to increase production, clarifying the main attack direction this year, tapping new production potential, and making preparations in terms of ideology, experience, and material as early as possible, striving to achieve new victories and climb higher peaks in the new struggle in 1966—the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    在高产道路上阔步前进的苏州专区
    身在太湖边
    胸怀全中国
    江苏省苏州专区人民，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，为革命种田，用科学方法种田，使全区粮食连续四年大幅度增产。一九六五年，全专区的棉花也获得了大丰收。全区的油料、蚕茧、生猪以及其它多种经营也有较大幅度的发展。多种经营的总产值比一九六四年增长了三成多。
    苏州专区位于江南太湖之滨，是我国重要的商品粮基地之一。这里湖泊密布，土壤肥沃，自然条件比较优越，但是解放前，堤防失修，河港淤塞，水旱灾害经常发生。解放以后，特别是公社化以后，苏州人民大力复堤修圩，疏河筑堰，开渠挖沟，联圩建闸，增加机械排灌设备，兴建电力排灌工程。全区从解放初期到一九六二年，光兴修水利工程的土方就有三亿四千多万立方米，从而使得干旱的威胁基本上消除，雨涝的灾害大大减轻。全区百分之八十以上的农田实现机电排灌，有了稳产高产的基础。
    一九六二年，苏州专区人民以顽强不屈的革命精神，战胜了“十四号台风”，战胜了几十年来少见的洪水暴雨，粮食生产比上一年增产近两成。
    一九六三年，全专区粮棉产量超过了历史上最高水平。
    这时候，有人就在议论：“产量不低了，贡献不少了，对上对下交代得过去了。”“有了这样高的产量，今后能保住就蛮好了。”
    是满足于“过得去”的现状呢，还是继续革命，生产出更多的东西，为国家作出更大的贡献？
    随着群众性的大学毛主席著作活动的展开，随着社会主义教育运动的深入，随着比学赶帮超竞赛的蓬勃兴起，苏州人站得高了，看得远了。他们说：种田人不能光看到自己鼻子底下的小天地，不能满足现状，应该站在太湖边，看到天安门。
    于是，一九六四年，苏州专区进一步出现了水稻良种大推广、耕作制度大改革和栽培技术大提高的新形势，在高产更高产的道路上又迈出了一大步：粮食增产了两成多，棉花增产了四成多，油料增产了六成多，多种经营总产值增长了三成多。
    这时，中共江苏省委及时指示苏州地委：“在大幅度增产以后，往往会出现两种不同的态度：一种是心满意足，骄傲起来，停滞不前，这样，连既得的成就也难以巩固；另一种是，以一分为二的辩证观点，既看到成就，又看到不足，继续奋发图强，不断革命，不断前进。”
    一九六五年，苏州地区的各级领导、广大干部和农民群众，以不断革命、彻底革命的精神作标尺，来更高地要求自己，破除故步自封、骄傲自满的思想苗头，对照国家建设发展的需要，看待自己的成就，确立新的奋斗目标。这样，苏州专区在农业高产的道路上就不断前进，对国家的贡献也越来越大。一九六四年，提供给国家的商品粮达二十一亿三千万斤，棉花近七十万担，另外还为国家、为市场提供了大量的其它工业原料和生活资料。一九六五年对国家的贡献，又比一九六四年增加。
      树样板带全面
          科学种田道路宽
    苏州人种田，一向以精耕细作远近闻名。从一九六三年开始，苏州采取树样板带全面的办法推广陈永康的水稻高产经验，精耕细作的程度又提高到更高的水平。
    这年开春，专区、县和公社，在各种不同类型地区，建立了二百四十多个学习和推广陈永康经验的示范基点。这些基点都由领导干部、农民群众和农业科学技术人员“三结合”。从水稻的育秧、整田、栽种，一直到田间的水肥管理，都由陈永康亲自掌握的示范点先做出样子，然后组织县、社示范点的领导干部和技术人员到现场参观，再由各级示范点进行连环示范，组织周围的社队干部和社员现场观摩。百闻不如一见，有了活样板，农民们一看就明，一学就会，一听就懂。头一年，陈永康的那一套培育壮秧、合理密植、浅水勤灌、适期施肥等先进技术，就在千村万队得到了不同程度的应用和推广。这一年，全区水稻亩产量比上一年增长了百分之十七，而各级示范点的水稻单产，普遍比周围条件大体相同的社队高出一成左右。由于领导号召和这些基点的示范影响，一个以学习和推广陈永康水稻高产经验为中心的群众性的科学实验活动，迅速在苏州专区蓬勃展开，促使水稻栽培技术不断提高。在两三年内，水稻生产的各个环节，从落谷育秧，到整田栽插，一直到中后期的田间水肥管理，都有成效地进行技术改革，促使水稻耕作水平年年提高，水稻产量不断上升。
    陈永康经验的普及和推广，使人们大大地尝到了科学种田的甜头。于是，一九六四年，这种树立样板推广陈永康经验的方法，就在全区范围内进一步普及开来。同时，样板也由种植水稻，发展到种植棉花、三麦、油菜、绿肥等多种作物，由单纯的经营农业，逐步发展到多种经营。样板的范围，也由几百亩、几千亩的小样板，向成万亩、几万亩的大样板发展。
    科学种稻，稻高产；科学种麦，麦翻身。苏州地区的干部群众，沿着精耕细作、科学种田的道路，把原来高产的水稻变得更高产，把原来低产的三麦也逐步引上了高产的道路。过去一直被称为“小熟”的麦子，历来产量不高。但是，由于人们发扬了象种水稻一样的革命精神，大面积地推广了常熟县倪永福薄片深翻、精选良种、深沟高?、阔?密植、精细管理等一套三麦高产经验，又采用了重施腊肥、早施苗肥等促使早出苗、早分蘖的措施，结果，全区一九六五年三麦增产了三成多，还出现了亩产三百斤以上的县、四百斤以上的公社、五百斤以上的生产队和七八百斤的高产田块。
    一面力争平衡增产
    一面促进新的不平衡
    一九六三年秋后，苏州地委在总结检查当年农业生产情况时发现：全区的粮食棉花生产，虽然都超过了历史最高水平，但还有相当数量的低产片、低产队和低产田。统计情况表明：占全区农田总面积五分之一的低产田，粮棉单位产量一般要比全区平均水平低两三成。“三低”面积虽小，但增产潜力巨大。于是，地委向全区人民提出改造“三低”的任务。
    低产田有两种：一种是零星的，分布很广，在低产社队有，在高产社队也有；一种是成片的，集中在阳澄湖圩区的二十几个公社里。两类地区的干部群众，开始时对改造“三低”缺乏信心。在低产田少的高产地区，有些人认为“面积小，油水少，不能抓了芝麻丢西瓜”；在低产田较多的低洼圩区，有些人则认为“面积大，困难多，国家不帮改不了。”
    对“三低”应该采取什么态度？各社各队，干部社员，在总结当年生产经验时，在规划来年生产时，都结合对这些问题逐一地讨论。情况一摆，细账一算，人们的思想认识提高了。吴县里口公社有三万多亩水稻，这一年平均亩产六百三十四斤，比上一年增长两成多。但一排队，全社单产四五百斤的低产田就有六千五百六十二亩；一算账，只要在下一年把这些田的水稻产量，提高到一九六五年的平均水平，全社就可以增产粮食八十五万斤，等于使全公社稻田每亩增产三十斤。这笔账一算，干部群众一致认为，低产田“芝麻虽小，油水不少”，力争全区耕地平衡增产是进一步提高农作物产量的一个重要门路。于是，大家积极行动起来。
    一九六四年，苏州专区各级党组织，一面以大寨精神武装干部群众，激发低产队干部群众奋发图强的决心，一面派出近两千名干部到低产队长期蹲点，跟群众一起寻找低产原因，研究改造措施。一年时间，全区一万零五百多个低产队，就有八千五百多个初步改变了低产面貌；全区一百五十万亩低产田中，就有五十万亩粮食增产三成以上，有的成倍翻番，其余一百万亩的产量也有不同程度的增加。
    这一年，各地在改造“三低”的同时，从遍及全区的各级样板点里，又涌现出了大批高产更高产的典型：有六十四个公社水稻平均单产八百斤以上；有十个公社皮棉平均单产一百二十斤以上；有更多的大队和生产队，水稻突破千斤，皮棉突破了一百五十斤。随着整个生产水平的提高，随着高产更高产典型大量涌现，老的“三低”改变了，新的“三低”又出现了。
    粮棉产量大踏步向前跃进了，林牧渔副等多种经营又显得落后了。一九六四年一开春，苏州地委又提出了“水旱保收，稳定增产，多种经营，全面发展”的目标。
    一面力争平衡增产，一面又积极促进新的不平衡。这样，一浪赶一浪，一浪高一浪，推动着苏州全专区的农业生产水平一年高一年。
    苏州地委体会到：一手改造“三低”，一手培植高产典型，是根据事物不平衡的发展规律，以不断革命精神，推动农业生产不断发展的一项重要的、应该长期实行的领导方法。
    目前，苏州地区的各级领导和广大干部群众，在一九六五年又获得丰收以后，在“学大寨，赶上海（郊区）”这一口号的鼓舞下，正以“打了胜仗找缺点”的精神，继续运用这个经验，对照高产样板找漏洞，对比先进找差距，一面总结高产更高产的经验，一面检查分析出现的新“三低”的原因，寻找新的增产途径，明确今年的主攻方向，挖掘新的增产潜力，及早地从思想上、经验上和物质上进行准备，力争在一九六六年——第三个五年计划的头一年，在新的斗争中取得新胜利，攀登更高峰。
