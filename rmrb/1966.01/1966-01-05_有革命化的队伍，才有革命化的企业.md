    A Revolutionary Enterprise Requires a Revolutionary Team

    How did the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company transform from a backward enterprise into an advanced one? The key lies in learning from Daqing. Why did learning from Daqing immediately work for Ma'anshan Iron and Steel? The key lies in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel learning the most fundamental experience of Daqing: using Mao Zedong Thought to promote the revolutionization of people. (Related reports on Ma'anshan Iron and Steel can be found on the second page)

    The development laws of our socialist society are fundamentally different from those of capitalist society. Capitalist society is based on private ownership and relies on material incentives to increase production. Their slogan is "Money makes the mare go." Our socialist society is based on public ownership and mainly relies on strengthening political and ideological work to enhance people's revolutionary consciousness, making them understand that working is for the revolution, farming is for the revolution, and all work is for the revolution. When people's awareness is raised, spiritual strength can be transformed into enormous material strength. Relying on material incentives or relying on political and ideological work to develop production is one of the important signs distinguishing capitalism from socialism. Strengthening political and ideological work is determined by the development laws of socialism and by the socialist economic base. The reason why Daqing has achieved such great results and can correctly reflect the path of China's industrialization proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is precisely because they have grasped the laws that conform to the development of our social and economic system.

    Our socialist enterprises have three major tasks: to produce products, to produce talent, and to produce experience. The talent mentioned here refers to people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who have both a high degree of communist consciousness and a considerable level of cultural and technical expertise.

    Socialist enterprises should put the work of transforming people first, and put the cultivation and creation of a new proletarianized workforce first. With such an advanced team, advanced products will surely be produced, advanced experiences will surely be created, and advanced enterprises will surely be created.

    "People are the first factor," that is absolutely true. Why did Ma'anshan Iron and Steel formulate various "turnaround plans" in the past, but never succeed? Why did it turn around at once after learning from Daqing? It is because the fundamental shortcoming of all previous "turnaround plans" was "seeing things but not people," focusing only on "things" and not seeing the fundamental factor of people. After learning from Daqing, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel first grasped the ideological revolutionization of people. This shows that if the mind does not turn around, production cannot turn around. Without a revolutionary workforce, there can be no revolutionary enterprise.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." People, with the leadership of the Communist Party, are different from ordinary people. They are people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, people who are selfless and dedicated to serving others, people who have the motherland in their hearts and the world in their eyes, people who are not afraid of hardship or death and are wholeheartedly for the revolution.

    Daqing has such people, and Ma'anshan Iron and Steel also has such people. The reason why Daqing can create miracles is because of such people. The reason why Ma'anshan Iron and Steel can make a great turnaround is also because of such people.

    Production depends on people, and people depend on ideology. "Change the thought, change the look of the factory," that's absolutely right. Only by constantly transforming people's thinking can we constantly change the face of the enterprise. The backward can become advanced, and the advanced will become even more advanced. In this sense, highlighting politics means highlighting the work of transforming people with Mao Zedong Thought; the four firsts mean that the work of transforming people with Mao Zedong Thought comes first.

    Learning the Daqing spirit and following the Daqing road is becoming the battle cry of all enterprises. Daqing has a wealth of things to learn from, the most fundamental of which is its experience in constantly transforming people with Mao Zedong Thought. Grasp this key, and then learning other experiences of Daqing will have a reliable ideological foundation.

    All enterprises should consciously undertake the great task of transforming people with Mao Zedong Thought and place this task at the top of all work. To produce excellent products, we must first train a red workforce. Let every one of our socialist enterprises, like the People's Liberation Army and like Daqing, become revolutionary furnaces for cultivating and transforming people.

### 有革命化的队伍，才有革命化的企业

    有革命化的队伍，才有革命化的企业
    马鞍山钢铁公司是怎样从一个落后的企业变成一个先进企业的呢？关键在于学大庆。为什么马钢一学大庆就灵了呢？关键又在于马钢学了大庆的一条最根本的经验，运用毛泽东思想，促进人的革命化。（有关马钢的报道见第二版）
    我们社会主义社会的发展规律，同资本主义社会的发展规律是根本不同的。资本主义社会是私有制，靠物质刺激来提高生产。他们的口号是“有钱能使鬼推磨”。我们社会主义社会是公有制，主要靠加强政治思想工作，提高人的革命自觉性，懂得做工为革命、种田为革命，一切工作都是为了革命。人的觉悟提高了，精神力量就可以转化为巨大的物质力量。依靠物质刺激还是依靠政治思想工作来发展生产，这是区别资本主义和社会主义的重要标志之一。加强政治思想工作是由社会主义的发展规律，是由社会主义的经济基础所决定的。大庆所以取得那么大的成绩，能够正确地体现党中央和毛泽东同志提出的中国工业化的道路，正是由于他们抓住了符合我们社会经济制度发展的规律。
    我们社会主义企业有三大任务：要出产品，出人材，出经验。这里所说的人材，就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，既有高度的共产主义觉悟，又有相当文化技术水平的人材。
    社会主义企业应该把改造人的工作放在第一位，把培养和造就一支无产阶级化的新型的职工队伍放在第一位。有了这样一支先进队伍，一定会生产出先进的产品，一定会创造出先进的经验，也一定会创造出先进的企业。
      “人的因素第一”，千真万确。为什么马钢过去制定过多种“翻身方案”，始终不得翻身？为什么学了大庆以后，一举翻身了呢？就是因为过去的所有“翻身方案”的根本缺点是“见物不见人”，只在“物”上打主意，没有看到人这个根本因素。学了大庆以后，马钢首先抓了人的思想革命化。这说明思想不翻身，生产是翻不了身的，没有革命化的职工队伍，就不可能有革命化的企业。
    毛泽东同志说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”人，有了共产党的领导，就不同于一般的人。他们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是毫不利己、专门利人的人，是胸怀祖国、放眼世界的人，是一不怕苦、二不怕死、一心为革命的人。
    大庆有了这样的人，马钢也有了这样的人。大庆所以能创奇迹，就靠这样的人。马钢所以能大翻身，也靠这样的人。
    生产靠人，人靠思想。“人变思想厂变容”，一点不错。只有不断改造人的思想，才能不断改变企业的面貌。落后的能变先进，先进的会更先进。从这个意义上讲，突出政治，也就是突出用毛泽东思想改造人的工作；四个第一，也就是用毛泽东思想改造人的工作第一。
    学大庆精神，走大庆道路，正在成为所有企业的战斗口号。大庆可学的东西十分丰富，其中最根本的，是它用毛泽东思想不断改造人的经验。抓住了这条纲，再学大庆的其他经验，也就有了可靠的思想基础。
    所有企业，都应该自觉地担负起用毛泽东思想改造人的伟大任务，并且把这个任务摆在一切工作的首位。要生产出色的产品，首先就要锻炼一支红色的职工队伍。让我们的每一个社会主义企业，都象解放军一样，象大庆一样，成为一座一座培养人和改造人的革命熔炉。
