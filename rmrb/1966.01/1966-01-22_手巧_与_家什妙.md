    "Skillful Hands" vs. "Wonderful Tools"
    Worker of Anshan Iron and Steel Company  Guo Yuzhong
    There is a Chinese idiom, "Skillful hands are not as good as wonderful tools." The meaning of this saying is nothing more than: No matter how high your technical level is, it is not as good as having good tools and advanced equipment. In the past, I thought this was quite right, but recent facts have given me a new understanding.
    One of our group members was absent due to illness, and the leadership asked me to work on his lathe for a day. This lathe is not only automated, but also has very precise components, which can be regarded as a "wonderful tool." Who knew that I made three turbine copper sleeves into waste products in one day. When processing the fourth one, with the help of the team leader, it barely passed.
    Why did working with "wonderful tools" still produce waste products? After thinking about it, I finally came to a conclusion: Good tools and advanced equipment are indeed favorable conditions for ensuring quality; however, without solid technical skills and the idea of quality first, even the most wonderful tools cannot solve the problem. Conversely, with a meticulous and conscientious attitude towards quality and superb operating skills, even if the equipment conditions are poor, quality can still be guaranteed.
    From this, it can be seen that the saying "Skillful hands are not as good as wonderful tools" is somewhat one-sided, because the decisive factor is people, not things.

    “手巧”与“家什妙”
    鞍山钢铁公司工人  郭玉忠
    我国有句成语，手巧不如家什妙。这句话的意思不外乎是：你有再高的技术水平，也不如有好的工具和先进的设备。以前，我觉得这说的挺对，但，最近的事实，使我有了新的认识。
    我们组有一位同志因病缺勤，领导上叫我到他的车床去干一天。这台车床不仅自动化，而且各个部件都很精密，可算是个“妙家什”了，谁知我一天干了三个涡轮铜套都成了废品，加工第四个时，在组长的帮助下，才算勉强合格。
    为什么用“妙家什”干活还出废品呢？想来想去，终于得出了一个道理：工具好、设备先进，确实是保证质量的有利条件；但是没有过硬的技术，没有质量第一的思想，家什再妙也不能解决问题。反之，有了对质量一丝不苟的认真态度和精湛的操作技能，即使设备条件差些，仍然可以保证质量。
    从这可以看出：“手巧不如家什妙”这句话是有一定片面性的，因为决定一切的因素是人，而不是物。
