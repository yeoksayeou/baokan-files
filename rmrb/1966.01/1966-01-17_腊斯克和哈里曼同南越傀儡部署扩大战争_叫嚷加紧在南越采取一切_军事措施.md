    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 16th -- News from Saigon: U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and U.S. President's Special Envoy Averell Harriman, who are actively deploying to expand the war under the guise of "peace," left Saigon for Manila on the 16th after a day of intense activity in South Vietnam.

    According to Western news agencies, Rusk and Harriman flew to Saigon from Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, the U.S. military base in Southeast Asia, on the morning of the 15th. Upon arriving at Saigon Airport, Rusk immediately clamored in his speech that "the United States is determined to do anything it can to ensure the security, freedom, and prosperity of South Vietnam."

    Subsequently, Rusk and Harriman held talks with Nguyen Cao Ky, the Prime Minister of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, and others, and issued a joint communiqué on the 16th. The communiqué emphasized that Rusk reiterated "the United States' continued full support for the Vietnamese government" (i.e., the South Vietnamese puppet regime) against so-called "foreign aggression." The communiqué also blatantly stated that while the United States is pursuing a "peace" offensive, "all necessary military measures must continue to be taken."

    Before arriving in Saigon on the 15th, Rusk and Harriman had both visited Bangkok. Rusk rushed to Bangkok on the 14th after meeting with Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin in New Delhi. After getting off the plane, he immediately held "thorough talks" with Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn and others on the current situation in Southeast Asia, especially the "Vietnam situation." According to reports, Rusk emphasized in the talks that the United States is determined to "fully fulfill" its "obligations" to the South Vietnamese puppet clique. He said, "The United States will never make concessions to the communists in the Southeast Asian region."

    He also said that the United States will "fully support Thailand's struggle against the communists."

    Averell Harriman, who calls himself the U.S. President's "peace" envoy, arrived in Bangkok on the 12th after actively trying to rope in the Menzies government in Australia to provide more cannon fodder for the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. During his days of activity in Bangkok, he also made a special trip to Vientiane to step up military deployments in order to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to Laos and the entire Indochina. He held talks with Prince Souvanna Phouma in Vientiane. According to Western news agencies, the talks covered U.S. actions in Vietnam, the world situation, and especially the situation in Laos. Harriman expressed in the talks the United States' determination to intervene in Vietnam to the end and its determination to oppose the so-called "North Vietnamese takeover of South Vietnam." According to Reuters, quoting Harriman, his talks with Phouma were "very satisfactory" and his trip to Vientiane was "very worthwhile."

    腊斯克和哈里曼同南越傀儡部署扩大战争
    叫嚷加紧在南越采取一切“军事措施”
    新华社十六日讯　西贡消息：在“和平”烟幕掩盖下积极扩大战争部署的美国国务卿腊斯克和美国总统特使哈里曼，在南越进行一整天紧张活动后，已经在十六日离开西贡前往马尼拉。
    据西方通讯社报道，腊斯克和哈里曼是十五日上午从美国在东南亚的军事基地泰国的首都曼谷飞到西贡的。刚到西贡机场，腊斯克在谈话中就叫嚷说，“美国决心做它力所能及的任何事情来保证南越的安全、自由和繁荣。”
    随后，腊斯克和哈里曼同南越傀儡政权总理阮高其等举行了会谈，并且在十六日发表了联合公报。公报强调说，腊斯克重申了“美国要继续全力支持越南政府”（即南越傀儡政权）反对所谓“外来侵略”。公报还露骨地表明，在美国推行“和平”攻势的同时，“必须继续采取一切必要的军事措施”。
    在十五日到达西贡活动之前，腊斯克和哈里曼都到曼谷进行活动。腊斯克是在新德里同苏联部长会议主席柯西金会谈后于十四日匆忙赶到曼谷的。他下飞机后，即同泰国总理他侬等就当前的东南亚局势，特别是“越南局势进行了透彻的会谈。”据报道，腊斯克在会谈中强调说，美国决定“彻底履行”对南越傀儡集团“所承担的义务”。他说，“美国决不会在东南亚地区对共产党让步。”
    他还说，美国要“全力支持泰国对共产党的斗争。”
    号称美国总统“和平”特使的哈里曼在澳大利亚积极进行拉拢孟席斯政府为美国侵越战争提供更多炮灰的活动后，于十二日到达曼谷。他在曼谷的几天活动期间，还特地跑到万象去活动，加紧军事部署，以便把侵越战争扩大到老挝和整个印度支那。他在万象和富马亲王举行了会谈。据西方通讯社透露，这次会谈谈到了美国在越南的行动、世界局势，特别是老挝局势。哈里曼在会谈中表示美国要在越南干涉到底，决心反对所谓“北越接管南越”。据路透社援引哈里曼的话说，他同富马的会谈“十分令人满意”，他的万象之行“很值得”。
