    According to Western news agencies, four thousand U.S. Marines recently landed with great fanfare more than 30 kilometers southeast of Quảng Ngãi City, attempting to cooperate with the invading troops of the American 1st Cavalry Division and 101st Airborne Division to conduct a large-scale "sweep" of the provinces of Quảng Ngãi, Bình Định, and Phú Yên in the central coastal region. It was claimed that this operation was announced only on the 30th for the sake of "secrecy." However, the Liberation Army was prepared. According to reports, when the enemy landed on the 28th, the Liberation Army had safely concealed itself, and the enemy "encountered no resistance." But on the 29th, the Liberation Army seized the opportunity to attack the enemy, inflicting casualties.
    The Liberation Army also launched clever and courageous attacks on the puppet troops northwest of Quảng Ngãi. Western news agencies reported: "North of the Bình Định area, the Viet Cong (Liberation Army) suddenly appeared in the pre-dawn darkness yesterday (28th), ambushing three companies of the Saigon government army (puppet troops) one after another northwest of Quảng Ngãi," killing and wounding a large number of enemies. The report said: The puppet troops suffered heavy losses.
    On the 28th, the Liberation Army also removed a puppet army stronghold in Gia Định province, 15 kilometers southwest of Saigon, and transferred victoriously after completing the mission.

They also disintegrated more than 180 enemy troops, shot down three enemy aircraft, sunk and damaged two enemy warships, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.
    The Liberation Armed Forces of Trà Vinh Province launched multiple attacks against the enemy from January 1st to 18th, fighting continuously in 84 battles, killing 307 enemy troops, wounding 83, and capturing 32. Among these actions, they completely annihilated two enemy companies, and another 186 puppet soldiers deserted.
    In the battles in Long Toàn commune in the coastal district and Lưu Nghiệp Anh commune in Trà Cú district, as well as in the anti-"sweep" operations in Tam Ngãi commune in Cầu Kè district, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated an entire enemy company and repelled the attack of an entire enemy regiment, and liberated the Long Toàn military sub-region.
    During this period, the Liberation Armed Forces of Trà Vinh Province also shot down three American aircraft, sunk and damaged two enemy warships, and seized more than 90 various weapons and a large amount of ammunition, etc.
    On the 19th, three battalions of South Korean mercenaries stationed in Phú Yên Province launched a "sweep" towards the Tuợng Giang area in Tuy Hòa district, attempting to prevent the people of these areas from celebrating the Spring Festival. The local Liberation Armed Forces resolutely smashed the enemy's conspiracy, fiercely counterattacking the invading enemy, causing casualties and losses. The guerrillas of Phước Bình, Phước Mỹ and other communes alone annihilated more than 50 enemy troops and seized a batch of weapons.
    On the 20th, the Liberation Armed Forces of Tuy Hòa district, Phú Yên Province, fiercely intercepted the South Korean mercenaries who were carrying out a "sweep" of Hòa Mỹ and Hòa Phong communes, completely annihilating one enemy company, defeating another portion, and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies.

    南越解放军在中部沿海地区痛打美军
    四千美军在广义市附近大举登陆进行“扫荡”遭到伤亡
    茶荣等三省人民武装年初歼敌六百名并全歼南朝鲜帮凶军一个连
    新华社三十日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军在南越中部沿海蓬山和绥和附近痛击美国第一骑兵师和第一○一空降师的同时，在中部沿海的另一个地区广义附近也展开了对敌人的猛烈攻击。
    据西方通讯社报道，四千名美国海军陆战队最近气势汹汹地在广义市东南三十多公里处登陆，企图配合美国第一骑兵师和第一○一空降师的侵略军，对中部沿海的广义、平定和富安省进行大规模“扫荡”。据称是为了“保密”，这一行动到三十日才宣布。但解放军早有准备。据报道，二十八日敌军登陆时，解放军已安全隐蔽起来，敌人“没有遇到抵抗”。但到二十九日，解放军即伺机攻击敌人，使敌人遭到伤亡。
    解放军对广义西北的伪军也进行了机智勇猛的袭击。西方通讯社报道说：“在平定地区以北，越共（解放军）昨天（二十八日）突然在黎明前的黑暗中出现，在广义西北先后伏击了西贡政府军（伪军）三个连”，大量杀伤敌人。报道说：伪军的损失是惨重的。
    二十八日，解放军还在西贡西南十五公里的地方拔除了嘉定省的一个伪军据点，任务完成后，胜利转移。
    新华社河内三十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量在茶荣、富安和边和省连续猛攻敌人，仅在今年头二十天就歼敌约六百名和全歼南朝鲜帮凶军一个连，瓦解敌军一百八十多名，击落敌机三架，击沉、击伤敌战船两艘，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    茶荣省解放武装力量从一月一日到十八日对敌人发动多次攻击，连续作战八十四次，共打死敌军三百零七名，打伤八十三名，俘虏三十二名，其中全歼敌军两个连，另有一百八十六名伪军开了小差。
    解放武装力量在沿海县隆全乡和茶句县刘业英乡的战斗以及在棋桥县三义乡的反“扫荡”中，歼灭了敌军整个连和击退了敌人整个团兵力的进攻，并且解放了隆全军事支区。
    在这期间，茶荣省解放武装力量还击落了美国飞机三架，击沉、击伤敌人战船二艘，缴获各种武器九十多件和大量弹药等。
    十九日，驻在富安省的南朝鲜帮凶军三个营向绥和县沱阳江一带地区展开“扫荡”，妄图阻挠这些地区人民欢度春节。当地的解放武装力量坚决粉碎了敌人的这个阴谋，猛烈反击来犯敌人，使敌人受到伤亡和损失。仅福平、福美等乡的游击队就歼灭敌军五十多名，缴获武器一批。
    富安省绥和县解放武装力量二十日猛烈阻击向和美、和丰乡进行“扫荡”的南朝鲜帮凶军，全歼敌人一个连，并击溃其他一部分，缴获武器和军用物资一批。
    边和省解放武装力量，十四日夜晚向驻守隆庆据点的伪军第十师的一个机械化单位发动了进攻，打死敌军八十二名，其中有十六名美国侵略军和一名伪军中尉；打伤十八名，其中有三名伪军大尉。
    与此同时，解放武装力量还袭击了驻在这个据点附近的一个伪军单位，歼敌多名。（附图片）
