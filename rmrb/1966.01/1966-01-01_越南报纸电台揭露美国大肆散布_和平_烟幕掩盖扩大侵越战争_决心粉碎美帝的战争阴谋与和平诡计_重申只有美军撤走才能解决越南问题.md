    Editor's Note: Recently, while stepping up preparations to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has been singing the tune of "peace" more loudly than ever before, exhausting all its efforts to play the trick of so-called "unconditional discussions." All sorts of demons and monsters have come out of their lairs, running around and engaging in rampant activities, creating a murky atmosphere for a time. However, one hand cannot cover the eyes of the world. Everyone with clear vision can see what kind of medicine the Johnson government is selling in its gourd: U.S. imperialism wants to spread a smokescreen of "peace" to cover up its conspiracy to expand the war. In fact, while chanting "peace" sutras, the likes of Johnson have also revealed their true colors, showing that the purpose of U.S. imperialism staying in South Vietnam cannot be changed. The so-called "unconditional discussions" are actually conditional. The condition is that the Vietnamese people must surrender unconditionally.
    The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhân Dân* and the "Voice of Vietnam" radio station have published commentaries in recent days, incisively exposing the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism, reiterating the solemn position that U.S. aggressor troops must withdraw from South Vietnam, and pointing out that the fundamental purpose of the Johnson clique's "unconditional discussion" trick is to force the Vietnamese people to agree to the U.S. conditions, that is, to recognize that U.S. troops can stay in South Vietnam. "The so-called 'maintaining ceasefire' suggested by the United States only means that the South Vietnamese people must lay down their weapons, while the U.S. aggressor troops can continue to trample on their motherland."
    In the face of the Vietnamese people's firm position to carry the struggle to resist America and save the country to the end, the American aggressors have no other choice but to get out of Vietnam.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st - The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhân Dân* published a commentator's article on December 31st, exposing the American aggressors' empty talk about peace to cover up their actions to expand the war.
    The commentator's article, entitled "U.S. Imperialism Talks Peace, Strengthens War of Aggression with Both Hands," pointed out that on December 20th, Johnson once again chanted his old peace sutra, claiming, "We will knock on all doors for peace." The U.S. authorities and their psychological warfare machine are constantly releasing the tone of "peace discussions." They have once again launched a rather noisy campaign about so-called "unconditional discussions." But what the American aggressors are doing further exposes their ambitions.
    The article said that just as they were loudly shouting "peace discussions," they were more frantically strengthening and expanding the war of aggression. They are preparing public opinion for sending more U.S. troops, increasing aircraft carriers, helicopters, and B-52 strategic bombers. Towards the North of our country, they have "escalated" to an extremely serious degree, bombing and strafing our country's densely populated areas and industrial areas. Towards Laos, they have begun to use B-52 bombers to drop bombs in batches and threatened to send American troops into Laos. Towards Cambodia, they are constantly infringing upon the country's territory and sovereignty. On December 21st, the day after Johnson claimed he would "knock on all doors for peace," the United States blatantly announced that it had authorized American troops to freely invade Cambodian territory. At the same time, they are also stepping up the establishment and expansion of their military bases in Thailand and elsewhere to serve their plans to strengthen and expand the war of aggression.
    The article emphasized that this is how the Johnson group "seeks peace"! Obviously, the American aggressors' current vigorous promotion of "peace discussions" is merely an attempt to cover up the extremely serious war actions they are currently carrying out and will carry out in the future. Facts have proven that every time the American aggressors shout about "peace discussions," they further strengthen and expand the war of aggression.
    The article said that actual actions are the most accurate standard for evaluating language. The U.S. authorities are clearly saying one thing and doing another. They have never shown any sincerity in wanting to solve the problem of peace in Vietnam. Their actions are war actions. Their peace rhetoric is all false.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station published a commentary on the 30th, exposing the fundamental purpose of U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" trick, which is to stay in South Vietnam, and pointing out, "To end the state of war in Vietnam, there is only one, and also the simplest way, and that is that the American aggressor troops must withdraw from South Vietnam and must allow the Vietnamese people to solve the problem of Vietnam themselves."
    The commentary, entitled "We are Determined to Smash All Conspiracies to Expand the War and All 'Peace' Tricks of the American Aggressors," said that in the past year, the U.S. imperialists have frantically implemented a counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy towards Vietnam. On the one hand, they have intensified and expanded the war of aggression against Vietnam to the greatest extent. On the other hand, in order to confuse public opinion and cover up their activities to expand the war, U.S. imperialism has strengthened the playing of their "peace" trick.
    The commentary said that Johnson not only personally came forward to release a smokescreen of peace, but also sent many special envoys to all parts of the world to loudly promote it. "The U.S. government not only publicizes it itself, but also asks their lackeys to help."
    The commentary said: "The United States not only repeatedly put forward 'negotiation' proposals, but even fabricated the myth of so-called 'Hanoi wants to negotiate' in order to spread confusion among public opinion."
    The commentary pointed out that when the Johnson government put forward their "peace" trick, they pretended to be "conceding," "But they never mentioned the most basic thing: the withdrawal of American troops from South Vietnam."
    The commentary emphasized that the reason for the current state of war in Vietnam is the U.S. imperialist aggression against South Vietnam. "Therefore, if you want to end the state of war, there is only one, and also the simplest way, and that is that the American aggressor troops must withdraw from South Vietnam and must allow the Vietnamese people to solve the problem of Vietnam themselves."
    The commentary pointed out that the fundamental purpose of the Johnson clique's "unconditional discussion" trick is to force the Vietnamese people to agree to the U.S. conditions, that is, to recognize that U.S. troops can stay in South Vietnam. "The so-called 'maintaining a ceasefire' suggested by the United States only means that the South Vietnamese people must lay down their weapons, while the U.S. aggressor troops can continue to trample on their motherland."
    The commentary said, "In short, although the U.S. imperialists talk a lot about peace, their fundamental conspiracy remains unchanged. This conspiracy is to continue to occupy South Vietnam, divide Vietnam for a long time, and turn South Vietnam into an American military base and a new type of colony."
    The commentary said: "Facts have shown that after every such clamorous campaign to promote the peace trick, the U.S. ruling group will definitely further escalate in their military adventures."
    The commentary further pointed out: "The only way to solve the Vietnam problem is that the U.S. government must solemnly declare and prove with practical actions that they accept the four claims of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, finally and unconditionally stop their air raids on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stop their aggression against South Vietnam, withdraw their troops from South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs. Only through this method can true peace be achieved."
      "The four claims of our government and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front provide a very just and reasonable basis for the political solution of the Vietnam problem."
    "As long as the American aggressors are still unwilling to prepare to recognize our government's position, all their talk about peace negotiations can only be hypocritical, and its purpose is to deceive public opinion."

    越南报纸电台揭露美国大肆散布“和平”烟幕掩盖扩大侵越战争
    决心粉碎美帝的战争阴谋与和平诡计  重申只有美军撤走才能解决越南问题
    编者按：最近，美帝国主义在加紧准备扩大侵越战争的同时，比过去任何时候都更喧嚣地高唱“和平”滥调，用尽力气玩弄所谓“无条件讨论”的骗局。种种色色的牛鬼蛇神全部出笼，到处奔走，大肆活动，一时闹得乌烟瘴气。但是，一手难遮天下目，约翰逊政府的葫芦里卖什么药，一切明眼人都看得清楚：美帝国主义是要散布“和平”的烟幕，掩盖其扩大战争的阴谋。事实上，约翰逊之流在口念“和平”经的时候，也露出了马脚，表明美帝国主义死赖在南越的目的是不能改变的，所谓“无条件讨论”，其实是有条件的，这个条件就是要越南人民无条件投降。
    越南《人民报》和“越南之声”电台连日发表的评论，一针见血地揭穿了美帝国主义的阴谋诡计，重申美国侵略军队必须撤出南越的严正立场，指出约翰逊之流搞“无条件讨论”骗局，其根本目的是要强迫越南人民同意美国的条件，那就是承认美国军队赖在越南南方不走；“美国建议的所谓‘保持停火’只是意味着，南越人民必须放下他们的武器，而美国侵略军队可以继续蹂躏他们的祖国。
    在越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的坚决立场面前，美国侵略者除了从越南滚出去之外，是不可能有任何其他选择的。
    新华社河内三十一日电  越南《人民报》十二月三十一日发表评论员文章，揭露美国侵略者侈谈和平，以掩盖其扩大战争的行动。
    这篇题为《美帝国主义口谈和平，双手加强侵略战争》的评论员文章指出，十二月二十日，约翰逊又口念他的陈旧的和平经，声称：“我们将为和平而敲所有的门”。美国当局和它们的心理战争机器不断放出“和平讨论”的论调。它们再一次展开关于所谓“无条件讨论”的相当喧嚣的战役。但是美国侵略者所干的事，却更暴露了它们的野心。
    文章说，正当它们大肆叫嚷“和平讨论”的时候，它们却更疯狂地强化和扩大侵略战争。它们正在为派遣更多个师的美国军队、增加航空母舰、直升飞机和B—52型战略轰炸机准备舆论。对我国北方，它们已“升级”到极其严重的地步，对我国的人口稠密地区和工业区进行轰炸和扫射。对老挝，它们开始使用B—52型轰炸机投掷成批的炸弹，并恫吓要把美军开进老挝。对柬埔寨，它们不断侵犯这个国家的领土和主权，十二月二十一日，即约翰逊声称“将为和平而敲所有的门”的第二天，美国却明目张胆地宣布授权美军可以随便侵犯柬埔寨的领土。同时，它们还加紧建立和扩大它们在泰国和其它地方的军事基地，以便为它们强化和扩大侵略战争的计划服务。
    文章强调说，约翰逊集团就是这样的“去寻求和平”！很显然，美国侵略者目前大肆宣传“和平讨论”，只不过是企图掩盖它们正在和即将进行的极其严重的战争行动。事实已经证明，美国侵略者每叫嚷一次“和平讨论”，它们就进一步强化和扩大侵略战争。
    文章说，实际行动是评价语言的最正确标准。美国当局明显地是说的一套做的另一套。它们从来没有表示出想解决越南和平问题的诚意。它们的行动是战争行动。它们的和平言词全是虚假的。
    新华社河内三十日电“越南之声”电台三十日发表评论，揭露美帝国主义玩弄“和谈”骗局的根本目的是要赖在越南南方不走，并且指出，“要结束越南的战争状态，只有一个，而且也是最简单的办法，那就是美国侵略军必须撤出越南南方，必须让越南人自己来解决越南的问题。”
    这篇题目为《我们决心粉碎美国侵略者的一切扩大战争的阴谋和一切“和平”诡计》的评论说，过去一年来，美帝国主义者疯狂地对越南实行反革命的两手政策。一方面，在最大程度上加紧和扩大侵越战争，另一方面，美帝国主义为了迷惑舆论和掩盖他们扩大战争的活动，加强玩弄他们的“和平”骗局。
    评论说，约翰逊不仅亲自出马施放和平烟幕，而且还派了许多特使到全世界各地去吵吵嚷嚷地宣传。“美国政府不仅自己宣传，而且还要求他们的走卒来帮一手。”
    评论说：“美国不但接二连三地提出‘谈判’建议，甚至捏造所谓‘河内想谈判’的神话，以便在舆论中间散布混乱。”
    评论指出，约翰逊政府在提出他们的“和平”骗局时，装出一副“让步”的样子，“但是，他们从来没有提到一样最基本的东西：美国军队撤出越南南方。”
    评论强调说，造成目前越南战争状态的原因就是美帝国主义对越南南方进行的侵略。“因此，如果要结束战争状态，只有一个，而且也是最简单的办法，那就是美国侵略军必须撤出越南南方，必须让越南人自己来解决越南的问题。”
    评论指出，约翰逊之流搞“无条件讨论”骗局，其根本目的是要强迫越南人民同意美国的条件，那就是承认美国军队赖在越南南方不走。“美国建议的所谓‘保持停火’只是意味着，南越人民必须放下他们的武器，而美国侵略军队可以继续蹂躏他们的祖国。”
    评论说，“简而言之，虽然美帝国主义者大谈和平，但他们的根本阴谋仍然未变。这一阴谋是继续占领越南南方，长期分割越南，并使南越变成美国的军事基地和新型的殖民地。”
    评论说：“事实表明，在每一次宣传和平骗局的这种大叫大嚷的运动之后，美国统治集团在他们的军事冒险中一定进一步升级。”
    评论进一步指出，“解决越南问题的唯一办法是，美国政府必须郑重宣布并以实际行动证明他们接受越南民主共和国的四项主张，最终地和无条件地停止他们对越南民主共和国的空袭，停止他们对越南南方的侵略，从越南南方撤出他们的军队，让越南人民自己来解决内部事务。只有通过这一办法才能取得真正的和平。”
      “我国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明为越南问题的政治解决提供了非常公正的和合理的基础。”
    “只要美国侵略者仍然无意准备承认我国政府的立场，他们关于和平谈判的一切言论只能是虚伪的，其目的在于蒙骗舆论。”
