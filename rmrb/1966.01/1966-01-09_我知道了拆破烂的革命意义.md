    I have been working in the dismantling section of the labor protection supplies repair factory in the cowshed for more than four years, dealing with old and dirty work clothes, gloves, hats, tents, etc. This work is dirty and tiring. At first, I didn't even want to look at it, let alone do it. But now I love it more and more. I feel uncomfortable if I don't work for a day.
    Speaking of this change, it's a long story. Like many young people, I thought that doing technical work had a future, and dismantling rags was useless. I didn't want to do it after working in the dismantling section of the repair factory for two days. The instructor had a heart-to-heart talk with me, which reminded me of the hunger and starvation I suffered when I was a child, and the fact that I couldn't get enough to eat for years. At that time, even a piece of ragged clothing like this would have been treated as a treasure. Recalling the bitterness and thinking about the sweetness improved my class consciousness. Later, the instructor also helped me study Chairman Mao's works, which made me realize the purpose of a person's life, which is to serve the people wholeheartedly, and that all work is doing revolution. I made up my mind to dismantle rags for the rest of my life.
    With the improvement of my ideological understanding, I became more and more enthusiastic about my work. In the past, I disassembled about ten old clothes a day, but later I gradually increased it to seventeen or eighteen a day. In order not to damage an inch of cloth, lose an ounce of cotton, or drop a button, I also tried my best to improve the tools for dismantling old clothes. Every year, the buttons and cotton cloth recovered from dismantling old clothes are reused on new work clothes, which not only saves a lot of funds for the country, but also enables these labor protection supplies to be delivered to the workers in time, encouraging their enthusiasm, producing more oil for the motherland, and adding strength to the world people's struggle against imperialism.

    我知道了拆破烂的革命意义
    我在牛棚劳保用品修补厂拆旧组工作已经四年多了，天天和破烂脏污的工服、手套、帽子、帐篷等打交道。干这些活，又脏又累，开始时，我连看都不愿意看，更不用说愿意干了。可现在却越干越爱干了，一天不工作就感到不舒服。
    提起这个变化，说来话长。我和许多年轻人一样，认为干技术活才有前途，拆破烂没出息。到修补厂拆旧组干了两天就不想干了。指导员找我唠家常，使我回忆起小时忍饥挨饿，长年不得温饱的情况，那时要能有这样一件破衣服就被当作宝贝了。忆苦教育提高了我的阶级觉悟。以后指导员又帮助我学习毛主席著作，使我认识到一个人活着的目的，就是要全心全意为人民服务，一切工作都是干革命。我就下定决心拆一辈子破烂。
    思想认识提高了，干活的劲头也就越来越足。过去一天拆十来件旧衣服，后来逐渐提高到一天拆十七八件。为了不损一寸布，不丢一两棉，不掉一个扣，我还想尽办法改进拆旧衣服的工具。每年将拆旧收回的扣子、棉布再重新用在新的工服上，不仅为国家节约了大量资金，还能把这些劳保用品及时送到工人手里，鼓舞了他们的干劲，为祖国多生产石油，为世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争增添力量。
