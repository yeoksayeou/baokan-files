Title: In an Unorganized Symposium

Edition: 6

    "Class Feeling Weighs a Thousand Jin" is a deeply moving and soul-stirring article. When the newspaper arrived at our school this day, a comrade began to read it silently and casually. Soon, she read it aloud, her voice so excited. Immediately, five or six people gathered around. In an instant, more and more people were listening, until the comrade finished reading the article. Everyone remained there, unwilling to leave. At this moment, everyone was extremely excited, and some even had tears in their eyes.
    In the evening, after finishing our homework, we unconsciously began to talk about this matter again.
    "If my child were pushed into the water and drowned, I would probably make a huge fuss."
    "If I had a thirteen-year-old child who was pushed into the water and drowned, I don't know how angry I would be."
    "Compared to Comrades Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan, we are truly worlds apart."
    "Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan are indeed worthy members of the great working class. They prioritized revolutionary feelings and the unity of the working class, endured immense misfortune, and suppressed immense grief. This noble revolutionary spirit can only exist in the new society."
      "… It's so touching! This incident fully reflects the high communist consciousness of our country's working class. It is the result of the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. The noble qualities of Comrades Zhang Yong'an and Cheng Chunlan, who highly value class feelings and the interests of the people, are truly worthy of our learning."
    In an unorganized symposium, everyone sighed with emotion, and everyone expressed their heartfelt feelings, pouring out their love for our great motherland. Everyone believed that with this spirit of class feeling and this force of unity and struggle among our people, what difficulties could stop us from advancing? What enemies cannot be defeated by us?

    在一个无人组织的座谈会上
    《阶级感情千斤重》是一篇感人肺腑、动人心弦的文章。当这天报纸来到我校时，开始是一个同志在漫不经心地默看，不一会儿她读出了声，声音又是那样的激动，于是，马上围上来五、六个人，霎时，听的人越来越多，直至那位同志把文章念完，大家还围在那儿不愿离开。这时，人人激动异常，有的人竟然热泪盈眶。
    晚上，作业改完，我们又不知不觉谈论起这事。
    “如果我的孩子被别人推下水淹死，可能要吵闹不休。”
    “如果我有个十三岁的孩子被别人推下水淹死，不知怎样生气。”
    “我们比起张永安、程春兰同志，真是相差十万八千里。”
    “张永安、程春兰夫妇，真不愧是伟大工人阶级的一员，他们以革命感情为重，以工人阶级团结为重，承受了巨大的不幸，忍住了巨大的悲痛，这种崇高的革命精神，只有在新社会才会有。”
      “……真太感人了！这件事充分反映了我国工人阶级高度的共产主义觉悟，它是毛泽东思想光辉照耀的结果，张永安、程春兰同志高度重视阶级感情和人民利益的高尚品质，真值得我们好好学习。”
    一个无人组织的座谈会，个个感叹万千，人人尽表衷肠，倾诉对我们伟大祖国的爱。都认为我国人民，有这种阶级感情的精神，有这种团结战斗的力量，有什么困难能阻挡住我们前进？有什么敌人，不能被我们战胜？
