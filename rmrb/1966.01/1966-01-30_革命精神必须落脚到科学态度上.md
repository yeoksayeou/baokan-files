    Mao Zedong once said: "In the world, the most feared thing is 'seriousness,' and the Communist Party emphasizes 'seriousness' the most."
  Seriousness is both revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude. In the eyes of Marxists-Leninists, revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude are inherently unified. Revolution is a world-shaking struggle to break the old world and create a new one. How could it be possible without a spirit that fears neither heaven nor earth, that is, without a high degree of revolutionary spirit? Breaking the old world and creating the new is also a struggle to move constantly from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. How could it be possible without a diligent and realistic attitude, that is, without a rigorous scientific attitude?
    The practice of the three young women of Daqing in advancing towards science and technology fully embodies the word "seriousness." They "know there are tigers in the mountains, but deliberately go to the tiger mountain," this is revolutionary spirit; they "do not allow any doubtful data, and must get to the bottom of even a five-second difference," this is scientific attitude. Their achievements are the victory of the close combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude.
    A revolutionary, in the struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, if he wants to truly accomplish a few things, he must first dare to do it, and at the same time, he must know how to do it. The things that these three young women of Daqing wanted to accomplish were unprecedented and even unheard of for them. The reason they were able to succeed was the result of daring to do and knowing how to do. If you don't dare to do, there is no way to acquire the ability to know how to do; if you don't know how to do, you can't achieve the goal of daring to do. Their practice proves that daring to do must be rooted in knowing how to do, and revolutionary spirit must be rooted in scientific attitude.
    We say that revolutionary spirit must be rooted in scientific attitude. Because, in revolution and construction, if we want to truly solve a few problems, we must fully understand their situation and grasp their laws. This requires a strict scientific attitude. We should use revolutionary spirit in investigation and research, in scientific experiments, and in summarizing experience. In a word, it is to use a scientific attitude to deal with all revolution and construction problems. In this sense, the higher the revolutionary enthusiasm, the better the scientific attitude should be. After the revolutionary enthusiasm has been boosted, whether there is a strict scientific attitude becomes the key to the success or failure of things.
    The three young women of Daqing are able to have both revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude because they have long adhered to the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our weapon for understanding and transforming the world. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can combine revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude in all situations and on all issues, overcome all difficulties, and move from victory to victory.
    Now, our country is full of prosperity everywhere, the political situation is good, the production situation is good, and people's enthusiasm is high. Under this excellent situation, the key to maintaining and constantly promoting people's revolutionary enthusiasm, and the key to ensuring the healthy development of the revolutionary and construction upsurge, is to advocate scientific attitude, promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and be calm promoters.

### 革命精神必须落脚到科学态度上

    革命精神必须落脚到科学态度上
    毛泽东同志说过：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”。
  认真，是革命精神，也是科学态度。在马克思列宁主义者看来，革命精神和科学态度本来就是统一的。革命，是打破旧世界、创造新世界的翻天覆地的斗争，如果没有一股天不怕地不怕的劲头，也就是没有高度的革命精神，那怎么可能呢？打破旧世界，创造新世界，又是一场不断从必然王国到自由王国的斗争，如果缺乏刻苦钻研、实事求是的态度，也就是缺乏严格的科学态度，又怎么可能呢？
    大庆三员小将向科学技术进军的实践，充分体现了“认真”二字。她们“明知山有虎，偏往虎山行”，这就是革命精神，她们“不允许有半点可疑的数据，差五秒钟也要弄个水落石出”，这就是科学态度。她们取得的成就，就是革命精神和科学态度密切结合的胜利。
    一个革命者，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中，要想真正办成几件事情，首先要敢干，同时还要会干。大庆这三员小将要办的几件事情，对她们来说，都是见所未见，甚至闻所未闻的。她们所以能够取得成功，都是敢干又会干的结果。如果不敢干，就无从取得会干的本领；如果不会干，就不能达到敢干的目的。她们的实践证明，敢干必须落脚到会干上，革命精神必须落脚到科学态度上。
    我们说，革命精神要落脚到科学态度上。因为，在革命和建设中，要想真正解决几个问题，就必须充分了解它们的情况，掌握它们的规律。这就必须具有严格的科学态度。我们应该把革命精神使在调查研究上，使在科学实验上，使在总结经验上。一句话，也就是使在用科学态度处理一切革命和建设问题上。在这个意义上说，革命干劲越高，科学态度应该越好。在革命干劲鼓足以后，是不是有严格的科学态度，就成为事情成败的关键了。
    大庆三员小将能够既有革命精神，又有科学态度，是由于她们长期坚持活学活用毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我们认识世界、改造世界的武器。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，我们就能够在任何情况下，在一切问题上，把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，克服一切困难，从胜利走向胜利。
    现在，我们国家到处是一片兴旺气象，政治形势好，生产形势好，人们干劲高。在这种大好形势下，保持和不断发扬人们的革命干劲的关键，保证革命和建设高潮健康发展的关键，就是提倡科学态度，发扬求实精神，做冷静的促进派。
