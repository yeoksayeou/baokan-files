    Editor's Note: The experience of the People's Liberation Army in developing Party membership, introduced here, is a very important experience with universal significance.
    "Branch Built at the Company Level" is a principle of Party and army building proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "An important reason why the Red Army fought hard and did not collapse was 'Branch Built at the Company Level.'" "Building a branch in each company and a group in each squad is one of the important principles of the Party's organization in the army." The People's Liberation Army implements Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, carries forward the glorious tradition of Party building in the Red Army, and admits a large number of outstanding commanders and fighters into the Party every year. In this way, although many Party member soldiers and cadres are demobilized or transferred to local areas every year, the troops still maintain "Party members in every squad and a Party branch in every company," ensuring "uninterrupted organization and no loss of experience." This is an extremely important guarantee for the People's Liberation Army to be very revolutionary and very combat-effective.
    The principle of "Branch Built at the Company Level" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong is not only applicable to the People's Liberation Army, but also to all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, and education. That is to say, grassroots units in all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, and education should establish and maintain a sound Party organization, and should have an appropriate number of strong Party members. If these grassroots units currently have no Party members or too few Party members, they should, in conjunction with the Socialist Education Movement, and the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment, strictly follow the provisions of the Party Constitution, actively, more extensively, and cautiously admit new Party members, and improve Party organizational life, in order to realize the core leading role of the Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: Over the past year, hundreds of thousands more outstanding soldiers and grassroots cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have joined the Communist Party of China. This is a year in which the development of Party membership throughout the army has seen a larger number of new members and of better quality than in recent years. The experience summarized by many units at the end of last year shows that as long as we emphasize politics, conscientiously arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions on Party building, the ideological awareness of the masses will be raised, the ranks of Party members will develop rapidly, the role of the Party branch as a fighting fortress will be stronger, and all work will be done more vividly and effectively.
    The vast majority of these newly admitted young Party members are Five-Good Soldiers, outstanding members of the Communist Youth League, and activists in studying Chairman Mao's works. Many of them were ordinary peasants, workers, and students a year or two ago. After joining the army, through the training and education of the Party organization, they quickly became vanguard fighters of the proletariat. They have fully played a exemplary leading role in various positions. In battle, they are brave and tenacious, actively leading the masses to charge forward; in daily work, they endure hardship before enjoying comfort, actively do ideological work, care for the hardships of the masses everywhere, take the lead in completing various tasks, and become a bridge connecting the Party and the masses.
    Strengthening Party building and expanding the Party ranks has a glorious tradition in the People's Liberation Army. Since the Enlarged Meeting of the Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee in 1960, this work has been done more regularly and systematically. In particular, after implementing the instruction of Vice Chairman Lin Biao on uninterrupted organization and no loss of experience last year, this work has been done more consciously. Although tens of thousands of Party member soldiers and cadres are demobilized or transferred to local areas every year to participate in industrial and agricultural production and other work, because a large number of young soldiers and grassroots cadres are admitted to the Party every year, the company still maintains Party members in every squad and a Party branch in every company, achieving uninterrupted organization and no loss of experience, making the Party branch the core of unified leadership and unity in the company.
    The most fundamental experience in carrying out Party development work in the People's Liberation Army is to regard Chairman Mao's discourse on Party building as the highest instruction, study it repeatedly, deepen understanding, and resolutely implement it. Over the past year, many troops have continuously organized Party members and Party cadres to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "The Struggle in Jinggang Mountain" and "The Chinese Communist Party in the National War," and have conducted discussions in connection with the great role of the Party in the revolutionary war years and the exemplary leading role played by Party members in their own units, so that everyone can further recognize the great significance of Chairman Mao's proposal of "Branch Built at the Company Level" and that the company should regularly maintain a strong Party member contingent. Many companies have also combined the current domestic and international class struggle situation to study and discuss Chairman Mao's discourse on Party building, and have further clarified that Party development work is not only related to the construction of the troops, but also has a far-reaching impact on China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. They said that an important reason why the Red Army was invincible in the past and why the People's Liberation Army is so revolutionary and combat-effective today is that the company has a strong Party member contingent. Because Party members and Party cadres have improved their understanding, they have implemented Chairman Mao's Party building thought more consciously and proactively than ever before. Every Party member cares about Party development, and everyone does the work of developing Party members, effectively ensuring the regularization of Party building.
    In the process of educating and training new Party members, all troops regard helping development targets to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well and arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental measure. After determining the targets for Party development, many troops' company-level Party branches often help them use Mao Zedong Thought to transform non-proletarian ideas and establish a world outlook of fighting to the end for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The troops use Chairman Mao's discourse on the Communist Party and Communist Party members as the basic teaching material for Party lessons, and organize non-Party activists to study, improve their understanding of the Party, correct their motives for joining the Party, and transform their thinking. Liao Quanfa, a soldier from the mortar company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou troops, came from a poor peasant family, and the Party branch determined him as a development target after he joined the army. For a period of time, Liao Quanfa was not very stable in his mood because of some problems in his family life. Li Qinghui, a Communist Party member and soldier, studied "Serve the People" with him and helped him correctly handle the relationship between individuals, families, and the country and revolution. Later, according to his daily performance and ideological activities, he helped him study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against individualism. After more than a year of training and education, this young soldier joined the Party and became a soldier with a high level of ideological awareness.
    According to Chairman Mao's teaching that Communist Party members should experience wind and rain and see the world, many troops also pay great attention to placing non-Party activists in the most difficult and arduous environments and in the most intense struggles to test and temper them during the process of training and developing Party members, so that they can withstand dangers and storms through the tempering of actual struggle. The machine gun company of a certain unit of the Shenyang troops often uses various opportunities to put the Party's development targets in mass struggles to train them. Once, when the troops went out for construction, the Party branch consciously arranged for non-Party activists to live in the homes of rural commune members, so that they could have extensive contact with the masses, train their class stand and ability to distinguish right from wrong, and, in conjunction with their ideological performance, organize them to study Chairman Mao's discourse on class and class struggle, improve their class consciousness, and strengthen their class stand. Many company-level Party branches also often train the ideological quality and organizational discipline of development targets through independently carrying out tasks; and train the class stand of development targets through various political movements, so that development targets can maintain the true color of a Communist Party member in any situation after joining the Party.
    The troops have also realized from the work of developing Party members that only by grasping the training and education and overcoming the idea of waiting for "natural redness" can the growth process of non-Party activists be shortened. In the past year, many troops, according to the spirit of "selecting seedlings early, examining them early, and training them early," paid attention to understanding and grasping the family situation, social relations, and performance in production and study of new soldiers when sending people to local areas to receive them. After arriving at the troops, after a certain period of education and understanding, they selected outstanding elements as development targets. In the process of training and education, they also achieved annual plans, quarterly arrangements, and monthly research, carefully controlling the quality, absorbing one when it is mature, so that the work of Party development is in-depth, meticulous, and more effective.

    支部建在连上，连队经常保持一支坚强的党员队伍
    解放军坚决执行毛主席的建党指示
    一年来又接受几十万优秀战士和基层干部入党
    编者按：这里介绍的人民解放军发展党员工作的经验，是一项具有普遍意义的很重要的经验。
    “支部建在连上”，是毛泽东同志提出的建党、建军的一个原则。毛泽东同志说：“红军所以艰难奋战而不溃散，‘支部建在连上’是一个重要原因。”“每连建设一个支部，每班建设一个小组，这是军中党的组织的重要原则之一。”解放军贯彻执行毛泽东同志这个指示，发扬红军中党的建设的光荣传统，年年接受大批优秀指战员入党。这样，尽管年年有许多党员战士和干部复员或转业到地方，而部队仍然是“班班有党员，连连有支部”，这就保证了“组织不断线，经验不失传”。这是解放军所以能够非常革命化、非常战斗化的一个极其重要的保证。
    毛泽东同志提出的“支部建在连上”这个原则，不仅适用于解放军，也适用于工、农、商、学各个方面。这就是说，工、农、商、学各个方面的基层单位，都应当建立并且保持一个健全的党组织，都应当有适当数量的坚强的党员。这些基层单位，如果现在没有党员或者党员太少的，就应当结合社会主义教育运动，结合阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，严格按照党章的规定，积极地、较多地、慎重地接受新党员，并且健全党的组织生活，以实现党的核心领导作用。
    新华社十三日讯　一年来，中国人民解放军又有几十万优秀战士和基层干部加入中国共产党。这是几年来，全军在发展党员的工作中，发展数量较多、质量也很好的一年。去年年终，许多单位总结的经验表明，只要突出政治，认真用毛主席思想武装头脑，严格按照毛主席有关建党的指示办事，群众思想觉悟就提得高，党员队伍就发展得快，党支部战斗堡垒的作用就更坚强，各项工作也就做得生动活泼、更有成效。
    这些新入党的年青党员，绝大部分是五好战士、优秀团员和学习毛主席著作积极分子。他们当中有不少人一两年前还是普通的农民、工人、学生，入伍后，经过党组织的培养教育，迅速成为无产阶级先锋战士。他们在各个岗位上，充分发挥了模范带头作用。战斗中，英勇顽强，积极带领群众冲锋陷阵；日常工作中，吃苦在前，享受在后，积极做思想工作，处处关心群众疾苦，带头完成各项任务，成为党和群众联系的桥梁。
    加强党的建设，扩大党的队伍，在人民解放军中有光荣的传统。一九六○年中共中央军委扩大会议以来，这项工作做得更经常、更有计划。特别是去年贯彻了林彪副主席提出的组织不断线、经验不失传的指示以后，这项工作做得更自觉了。尽管年年有数以万计的党员战士和干部复员或转业到地方，参加工农业生产建设和其他工作，由于每年都吸收大批青年战士和基层干部入党，连队里仍然保持了班班有党员、连连有党支部，做到了组织不断线、经验不失传，使党支部形成连队统一领导和团结的核心。
    在人民解放军中进行党的发展工作最根本的经验是：把毛主席有关建党论述当做最高指示，反复学习，加深认识，坚决贯彻。一年来，许多部队不断组织党员和党的干部学习毛主席《井冈山的斗争》、《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》等文章，联系革命战争年代党的伟大作用，联系本单位党员所起的模范带头作用进行讨论，使大家进一步认识到毛主席提出的支部建在连上，连队经常保持一支坚强的党员队伍的重大意义。很多连队还结合当前国内外阶级斗争形势，学习讨论毛主席有关建党的论述，进一步明确了党的发展工作，不仅关系着部队建设，而且对我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设有着深远的影响。他们说，当年红军所以无坚不摧，今天人民解放军所以非常革命化、战斗化，一个重要原因是连队有着坚强的党员队伍。由于党员和党的干部提高了认识，贯彻毛主席建党思想比以往任何时候更为自觉，更为主动。党员人人关心党的发展，个个做发展党员的工作，有效地保证了党的建设经常化。
    在教育培养新党员过程中，各部队都把帮助发展对象学好用好毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想武装头脑，作为最根本的一条措施。很多部队连队党支部在确定了党的培养发展对象以后，经常帮助他们用毛泽东思想改造非无产阶级思想，树立为中国革命、世界革命奋斗到底的世界观。各部队以毛主席有关共产党和共产党员的论述作为党课的基本教材，组织非党积极分子学习，提高他们对党的认识，端正入党动机，改造思想。广州部队某部迫击炮一连战士廖全发，贫农家庭出身，入伍后党支部确定为发展对象。有一段时间，廖全发因为家庭生活有点问题，情绪不大安定，共产党员、战士李清辉和他一起学习《为人民服务》，帮助他正确处理个人、家庭和国家、革命的关系。以后又根据他的日常表现和思想活动，帮助他学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想同个人主义进行斗争。经过一年多培养教育，这个青年战士入了党，成为有较高思想觉悟的战士。
    根据毛主席关于共产党员应该经风雨、见世面的教导，很多部队在培养和发展党员过程中，还很注意把非党积极分子放在最艰苦、最困难的环境中，放在最激烈的斗争中去考验磨练，使他们通过实际斗争的锻炼，能够经得起险阻、顶得住风浪。沈阳部队某部机枪连，经常利用各种机会，把党的培养发展对象放在群众斗争中去锻炼。有次部队外出施工，党支部有意识地让非党积极分子住在农村社员家里，让他们广泛和群众接触，锻炼他们的阶级立场和辨别是非的能力，并且结合他们的思想表现，组织他们学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，提高阶级觉悟，坚定阶级立场。许多连队党支部，还经常通过单独执行任务锻炼发展对象的思想品质和组织纪律观念；通过各种政治运动锻炼发展对象的阶级立场，使发展对象在入党以后能在任何情况下保持共产党员的本色。
    各部队从发展党员的工作中还体会到，只有抓紧培养教育，克服等待“自然红”的思想，才能缩短非党积极分子的成长过程。近一年来，许多部队根据“早选苗、早考察、早培养”的精神，当派人到地方接收新战士时，就注意了解和掌握新战士的家庭情况，社会关系，和在生产、学习中的表现。到部队后，经过一定的教育和了解，就选择优秀分子作为发展对象。在培养教育过程中，他们又做到了年有计划，季有安排，月有研究，把好质量关，成熟一个，吸收一个，使党的发展工作深入细致，更有成效。
