    The Dazhai of Hainan Island
    ——Recording the Struggle of the Shiwu Brigade in Dan County, Hainan Island, to Achieve a Double Harvest of Grain and Forestry

    The Shiwu Brigade of Nada Commune in Dan County is our country's "southernmost Dazhai." "Dazhai" is all over the country, and our agricultural front, like other fronts, presents a flourishing scene.

    The development of the Shiwu Brigade, like other Dazhai-style units, has gone through a difficult and tortuous path.

    Seventy-three people who went to the mountains to cultivate land were reduced to twelve. Why? Because people's minds were not armed, and politics was not given prominence. Soon, the number of people going to the mountains to cultivate land increased sharply to one hundred and thirty. Why? The Party branch armed people's minds with the spirit of the General Line and gave prominence to politics.

    Command everything with Mao Zedong Thought. Give prominence to politics in all matters. This is the basic experience of the Shiwu Brigade.

    Beneath the Wuzhi Mountains, on the edge of the Beibu Gulf, the Shiwu Brigade of Nada Commune in Dan County, Hainan Island, has large tracts of tropical economic forests on the mountains, and rice fields below. The forests are interspersed with evergreen citronella grass, pineapples, southern coconuts, and other tropical economic crops. Strangers would hardly expect that a few years ago, most of the mountains here were barren, infested with miasma and inhabited by wild animals. After the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958, the Shiwu Brigade, with only one hundred and seven households, took grain as the key link and developed tropical economic forests. Without spending a penny of the state's money, they relied on their own hands, machetes, and hoes to build the barren mountains into a treasure mountain. Now, this brigade is hailed as our country's "southernmost Dazhai."

    Before 1958, Shiwu needed the state to supply grain every year. After the establishment of the commune, the Shiwu people provided the state with an average of more than 10,000 jin of grain per household in eight years. By the end of 1965, the collective reserves of grain also reached more than 110,000 jin. In 1959, the agricultural, forestry, and sideline products sold to the state by each member of the Shiwu Brigade were worth only more than 100 yuan. In 1964, this had risen to 349 yuan, and in 1965 it continued to increase to more than 370 yuan.

    The formerly very poor Shiwu has now become a large and prosperous family. By 1964, the team had more than 1.2 million yuan in collective property and had tractors, automobiles, threshing machines, and rice milling machines.

    Before liberation, the Shiwu people lived in thatched huts and often lacked money and food. Now, every household lives in tile-roofed houses. Ninety percent of the members have savings.

    Learn from Yu Gong, Fight Hard at Yanzi Pool

    The road taken by the Shiwu people is a road of self-reliance in overcoming difficulties. In 1959, the Shiwu people, who had just realized communization, were determined to change the backward state of production. But the weather was not good, and there was a severe drought. It hadn't rained heavily for eleven months. The mountain streams that hadn't stopped flowing for fifty or sixty years dried up, the lake and ocean fields that had accumulated water for many years cracked, the drought crops withered, and the rice suffered severely, causing difficulties in the lives of the members. Two paths were placed before the Shiwu people: to flee the famine and wait for state relief, or to do it themselves and save themselves through production?

    Party Branch Secretary Hu Song said it well: "No matter how great the difficulties are, our ambition is greater than the sky. Revolutionaries must stand up and walk in the most difficult times." After discussion, the Shiwu people chose the latter path. While planting sweet potatoes in the drought-cracked paddy fields, they went to the mountains to reclaim wasteland and plant cassava. On October 3, 1959, the wasteland reclamation team led by Hu Song went to the largest mountain in the entire brigade - Yanzi Pool. In the old forest of Yanzi Pool, the sound of long machetes and mountain axes rang out. On the first day, people talked and laughed, very lively. But on the second day, some people began to complain. The trees here had deep roots. There were maple trees that two people couldn't embrace, old banyan trees with particularly developed roots, and dense thickets of thorns and mountain vines. It was naturally very difficult to deal with these trees with simple knives and axes. Almost everyone reclaiming the mountains had blisters on their hands and bloodstains on their feet and legs. Some people wavered and said, "State-owned farms have tractors and explosives to open up mountains. Can we do it with a knife and an ax?" So, some people found an excuse to go home, and some simply said they wouldn't do it. In less than a few days, the seventy-three people who went up the mountain with Hu Song were reduced to twelve. The initial battle was lost.

    The Party branch summed up the lessons and reorganized, starting with class education and revolutionary tradition education. At Party branch meetings, Communist Youth League branch meetings, and member representative meetings, people used the spirit of the General Line to examine themselves and compared themselves to the spirit of Yu Gong. The more they discussed, the clearer they became, and the more motivated they were. They said: Poor people have ambition and must do it themselves to overcome difficulties. If we don't reclaim the mountain well, we won't come down. The mountain reclamation team went up the mountain for the second time, this time not with twelve people, not with seventy-three people, but with one hundred and thirty people. This mountain reclamation team, which had undergone class education, withstood the test of various difficulties. They ate on the barren mountains and lived on the barren mountains. On winter nights, if they didn't have quilts to cover themselves, they lit bonfires to keep warm. Poisonous snakes, centipedes, poisonous caterpillars, etc. could injure people at any time, but people came up with various ways to fight them. The Yanzi Pool area was where the Qiongya Column operated before liberation. Hu Song had entered Yanzi Pool to deliver letters to the guerrillas and avoid enemy pursuit. Therefore, in times of difficulty, Hu Song used the heroic deeds of the war years to inspire himself and his companions.

    The Shiwu people thus accepted tempering and reclaimed more than one hundred and ten barren mountains, planting cassava. By 1960, a bumper harvest of grain was achieved.

    Look Forward, Develop Rubber Forests

    In 1961, after healing the wounds of the disaster, the Shiwu people continued to explore the way forward. At this time, the cassava on the newly reclaimed wasteland was harvested. The paddy fields and sloping fields at the bottom of the ditch, which accounted for about one-fifth of the total cultivated area, were expanded, and the grain planted also had a bumper harvest. The entire brigade was already more than self-sufficient in grain. The issue that the members were discussing was: How should the large tracts of newly reclaimed mountain land be managed in the future? Should they be content with the status quo and just eat their fill? Or should they develop economic forests and implement diversified operations?

    Most members advocated long-term construction, developing economic forests, especially rubber forests needed by the state. Some upper-middle peasant members had their own small calculations, advocating that all the cassava land should be planted with citronella grass after the harvest; in this way, the income would be at least more than 100,000 yuan a year. After two years, when the land became infertile and could not be planted, they would abandon it. They believed that planting rubber trees required an investment of dozens of yuan per mu, and that it would not be profitable until seven or eight years later, which was not worthwhile. Some even said that a hundred-year plan was empty talk, and immediate income was the reality. At that time, there was a fierce debate between the two views.

    The poor and lower-middle peasant members opposed the idea of only considering immediate interests and advocated taking care of both immediate and long-term construction. They said: Although the return from planting rubber trees is delayed, it can be harvested for thirty or forty years. Planting it lays the foundation for establishing a solid collective economy, and more importantly, the state needs rubber; if all the land is planted with citronella grass, the soil and water on the mountain cannot be conserved. In the future, if the mountain becomes barren and the soil covers the fields, the loss will be even greater!

    After full discussion and clarification of right and wrong, the members finally unanimously decided: Rather than endure more hardship and share less money in the short term, they should make greater contributions to the country and the collective.

    The direction of development was clear. However, a large amount of funds was needed for rubber tree seedlings. What to do if there was a lack of funds? The Party branch consulted with the masses, and everyone believed that they should not take out loans from the state, but should carry forward the spirit of self-reliance during the mountain reclamation period, collecting seeds and cultivating seedlings themselves. The Party branch adopted this suggestion. Thus, under the diligent care of the Shiwu people, a large number of rubber tree seedlings were cultivated. The afforestation team went up the mountain again. Under the scorching sun, they dug tree holes with their bare arms; in the heavy rain, they planted with rain pouring over their bodies; when typhoons struck, many people went up the mountain to protect the seedlings before the wind had completely stopped. The old production team leader, Qiu Yun, who was nearly fifty years old and in poor health, resolutely moved into the forest to watch over the newly planted rubber forest.

    The Shiwu people also skillfully comprehensively utilized the land, implementing intercropping and interplanting of multiple crops, planting citronella grass, pineapples, corn, sesame, etc. in the middle of the trees. In the early stages of rubber forest growth, nurturing management is needed. After interplanting crops, the frequent tilling, loosening of soil, and weeding are also conducive to the growth of young trees. In 1961, the entire brigade planted 3,200 mu of food crops in the middle of the tropical economic forests, harvesting more than 900,000 jin of grain. In the first few years, the investment in each mu of rubber forest was 40 yuan, but in three years, the income from intercropping the young trees reached more than 50 yuan per mu.

    Grasp Infrastructure Construction, Greatly Increase Grain Production

    With grain, tropical economic forests can be developed. The Shiwu Brigade's new rubber forest was rapidly developed on the basis of overcoming disasters and solving the grain problem. After the new rubber forest grew, the Shiwu people concentrated their efforts on solving the problem of stable and high grain yields. Starting in the winter of 1963, the Shiwu people transferred appropriate labor to carry out basic farmland construction. They dug 30,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and built a 9-kilometer-long canal to divert water for irrigation, enabling the "waiting-for-rain fields" that originally accounted for 60 percent of the total paddy fields to be irrigated by gravity flow. They also dug more than 100 drainage ditches with a total length of more than 10,000 meters to lower the groundwater level and transform the low-yield lake and ocean fields. More than 500 mu of low-yield paddy fields that could only be harvested once a year are now 90 percent planted with double-season rice. Coupled with the adoption of other yield-increasing measures, in recent years, the rice yield of the Shiwu Brigade has rapidly increased. The average yield per mu in 1957 was 436 jin, which increased to 738 jin in 1964, and reached more than 800 jin in 1965. The fact of the double harvest of forestry and grain educated the people who originally disagreed with planting rubber forests. Now they say: Thanks to the Party branch's steady helm, otherwise we wouldn't be able to make such a great contribution to the country, and our own income wouldn't have increased so quickly!

    The Shiwu people demand that they continuously revolutionize themselves and constantly make the greatest contribution to the country's construction. At the same time, they also help fraternal brigades and teams everywhere. When fraternal brigades and teams suffered disasters, the Shiwu people took the initiative to send their own grain reserves to the class brothers who suffered the disasters. The oil palm farm run by the commune had a single operation and low income. When they learned about this, they sent people to provide technical guidance, which significantly increased the farm's income in 1965.

    The neighboring Qiaonan Brigade is a red banner for diversified operations on Hainan Island. Its family fortune is thicker than Shiwu's, and some of its work is more meticulous than Shiwu's. The Shiwu people not only humbly learn from them, but also help Qiaonan to progress faster. Qiaonan's dry rice yield was low, so Shiwu supported Qiaonan with its best dry rice fine varieties. Qiaonan has more old tropical economic forests than Shiwu, and the labor force is tight, so Shiwu introduced its advanced management experience to Qiaonan.

    Some people say: The Shiwu people are stupid. They clearly see that others are about to surpass them, but they still wholeheartedly help them. The Shiwu people say: Being able to help others make a greater contribution to the country's socialist construction is precisely our ideal.

    海南岛上的大寨
    ——记海南岛儋县石屋大队夺取粮林双丰收的斗争
    儋县那大公社石屋大队，是我们国家“最南的大寨”。“大寨”遍全国，我国的农业战线同其他战线一样，一片兴旺气象。
    石屋大队的发展，跟其他大寨式单位同样，走过一段艰难、曲折的道路。
    七十三个上山垦殖的人，一下减少到十二个。为什么？因为没有把人们的头脑武装起来，没有突出政治。不久，上山垦殖的人骤增到一百三十个。为什么？党支部用总路线的精神武装了人们的头脑，突出了政治。
    用毛泽东思想统帅一切。在一切问题上突出政治。这就是石屋大队的基本经验。
          编者
    五指山下，北部湾边，海南岛儋县那大公社的石屋大队，山上长着大片热带经济林，山下是米粮川，林木中间又套种着四季常青的香茅、菠萝、南椰等等热带经济作物。陌生人很难料到，几年前这里的山，大部分还是瘴疠交侵、野兽聚居的荒山。一九五八年成立人民公社以后，一个只有一百零七户人家的石屋大队，以粮为纲发展热带经济林，没有花国家一个钱，依靠自己的双手、砍刀和镐，把荒山建设成了宝山。现在，这个大队被人们誉为我国“最南的大寨”。
    一九五八年以前，石屋年年需要国家供应粮食。成立公社以后，石屋人在八年间平均每户为国家提供了一万多斤粮食。到一九六五年年底，集体储备的粮食也有十一万多斤。一九五九年，石屋大队每个社员交售给国家的农、林、副产品只值一百多元，一九六四年已经上升到三百四十九元，一九六五年继续增加到三百七十多元。
    原来十分贫困的石屋，现在变得家大业大。到一九六四年，全队有集体财产一百二十多万元，并且有了拖拉机、汽车、打谷机和碾米机。
    解放前，石屋人住的是草寮，经常缺钱缺粮，现在家家户户住上了瓦房。百分之九十的社员有存款。
    学愚公，奋战燕子潭
    石屋人走的道路，是一条自力更生战胜困难的道路。一九五九年，刚刚实现公社化后的石屋人，下决心要改变生产的落后面貌。但是天不作美，来了一场大旱，十一个月没下过一场透雨。五六十年没有断流的山溪断流了，长年积水的湖洋田裂了缝，旱作物枯死，水稻严重失收，社员生活发生了困难。两条道路摆在石屋人面前：是逃荒、等待国家救济，还是自己动手，生产自救？
    党支部书记胡松说得好：“困难有天大，我们的志气就比天还大。革命者就是要在最困难的时候站起来走路。”经过讨论，石屋人选择了后一条路。他们一边在旱裂的水田种甘薯，一边上山开荒种木薯。一九五九年十月三日，由胡松带领的开荒队，上了全大队最大的一座山——燕子潭。燕子潭的老林里，响起了长砍刀、开山斧的声音。第一天，人们有说有笑，好不热闹。但是第二天，有人就叫起苦来。这里树大根深，有两个人抱不拢的枫树，有根部特别发达的老榕树，有密密丛丛的荆棘和山藤。用简陋的刀斧对付这些树，自然非常吃力，几乎所有开山的人手上都磨起了血泡，脚上腿上血痕斑斑。有人动摇了，说：“国营农场有拖拉机和炸药，才能开山，我们一把刀一把斧能成吗？”于是，有的人找个借口回家，有的人干脆说不干了。不到几天，跟胡松上山的七十三个人就只剩下了十二人。初战失利了。
    党支部总结了教训，从阶级教育和革命传统教育入手，重整旗鼓。在党支部会上、团支部会上、社员代表大会上，人们拿总路线的精神检查自己，拿愚公精神对比自己。越讨论心里越亮，劲头越足。他们说：穷人有志气，一定要自己动手，克服困难。不开好山，就不下山。开山的队伍第二次上了山，这回不是十二人，也不是七十三人，而是一百三十人。这支经过阶级教育的开山队伍，经受住种种困难的考验。他们吃在荒山，住在荒山，冬夜没有被子盖，就升起篝火取暖；毒蛇、蜈蚣、毒毛虫等随时可能伤人，但是人们想出各种办法同它们进行斗争。燕子潭一带是解放前琼崖纵队活动的地区，胡松曾经为游击队送信躲避敌人追捕进过燕子潭。因此，在困难的时候，胡松就用战争岁月里的英雄事迹，来激励自己和同伴。
    石屋人就这样接受磨炼，把一百一十多座荒山开垦出来，种上木薯。到一九六○年，粮食获得大丰收。
    向前看，发展橡胶林
    一九六一年，石屋人在医好灾荒创伤以后，继续探索前进的道路。这时，新垦的荒山上木薯收获了，沟底扩大了约占总耕地面积五分之一的水田和坡地，种的粮食也丰收了。全大队粮食已经自给有余。广大社员议论的问题是：大片新垦的山地今后如何经营？是安于现状，吃饱就算呢？还是发展经济林木，实行多种经营？
    多数社员都主张长远建设，发展经济林木，特别是发展国家需要的橡胶林。有些上中农社员却打小算盘，主张木薯收后全部种香茅；这样一年最少也有十几万元的收入。过了两年地薄不能种了再撂荒。他们认为：种植橡胶树，每亩投资几十元，七八年后才有收益，不合算。甚至有的人说，百年大计是空话，眼前收入才是实。当时两种看法争论得很厉害。
    贫农下中农社员反对单顾眼前利益的想法，主张既照顾眼前又兼顾长远建设。他们说：种橡胶树虽然收益迟，但能收三四十年，种了它是为建立牢固的集体经济打下根基，更重要的是国家需要橡胶；如果全部种香茅，山上水土不能保持，将来山上荒了，山下泥土压了田，那损失才大哩！
    经充分讨论，明辨是非，最后社员一致决定：宁可眼下多吃点苦，少分几个钱，也要为国家和集体作出更大的贡献。
    发展方向明确了。但是，种橡胶树的种苗需要大批资金，缺少资金怎么办？党支部找群众商量，大家认为不能向国家贷款，应该发扬开山时期的自力更生精神，自己采种，自己育苗。党支部采纳这个意见。于是，在石屋人的辛勤抚育下，大批橡胶树的种苗育成了。造林队伍再次上山，在骄阳下，他们光着膀子挖树穴；在大雨中，他们浑身淌着雨水栽种；刮起了台风，不少人在风还没有全停的时候就上山护苗。年近半百的老生产队长邱运，身体不好，还坚决搬到林里去住，看守着新造的橡胶林。
    石屋人还巧妙地综合利用土地，实行多种作物的间作、套作，在林木中间种香茅、菠萝、玉米、芝麻等。胶林在幼林时期，需要抚育管理，间种农作物以后，通过经常的翻耕、松土和除草等活动，也有利于幼林的成长。一九六一年，全大队在热带经济林中间种粮食作物三千二百亩，收获粮食九十多万斤。在最初的几年，橡胶林每亩投资四十元，但是三年间幼林间作的收入每亩就达五十多元。
    抓基建，粮食大增产
    有了粮食才能发展热带经济林。石屋大队的新胶林就是在战胜灾荒，解决了粮食问题的基础上迅速发展起来的。新胶林长成了，石屋人又集中力量解决粮食的稳产高产问题。一九六三年冬天起，石屋人就抽调适当的劳动力，进行农田基本建设。他们挖了三万个土石方，修了九公里长的大渠，引水灌田，使原来占稻田总数百分之六十的“望天田”能够自流灌溉。他们还挖了一百多条总长一万多米的排水沟，降低地下水位，改造低产的湖洋田。原来五百多亩一年只能一收的低产稻田，现在百分之九十种了双季稻。加上采用其它增产措施，这几年，石屋大队的水稻产量迅速提高。一九五七年平均亩产四百三十六斤，一九六四年增加到七百三十八斤，一九六五年达到八百多斤。林粮双丰收的事实，教育了原来不同意种橡胶林的人。现在他们说：亏得党支部的舵掌得稳，不然对国家拿不出这大的贡献，自己的收入也不能增加这么快！
    石屋人要求自己不断革命，不断地为国家的建设事业作出最大的贡献。同时，他们也处处帮助兄弟社队。兄弟社队遭灾了，石屋人主动把自己的储备粮送到受灾的阶级兄弟手里。公社办的油棕农场经营单一，收入少。他们知道了，就派人前去进行技术指导，使这个农场一九六五年收入有了显著增加。
    邻近的侨南大队是海南岛多种经营的一面红旗，家底比石屋厚，有些工作比石屋做得细致。石屋人不仅虚心向他们学习，而且也还帮助侨南更快地进步。侨南的旱稻产量低，石屋就把自己最好的旱稻良种支援了侨南。侨南的老热带经济林木比石屋多，劳力紧张，石屋就把自己的先进管理经验介绍给侨南。
    有人说：石屋人傻，明看别人要超过自己了，还尽心帮助别人。石屋人却说：能帮助别人对国家的社会主义建设作出更大的贡献，这正是我们的理想。
