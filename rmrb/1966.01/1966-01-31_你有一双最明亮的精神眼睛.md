    "Six hundred million people are all like Yao and Shun." In our country, there are thousands upon thousands of people with strong wills, and Comrade Dai Dubo is one of them. In the past, during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, he fought bravely on the fiery battlefield; now, in the cause of socialist construction, he has overcome the difficulties of blindness and continues to fight in his ordinary post. Comrade Dai Dubo's deeds have moved many people. Recently, writer Wei Wei wrote a letter to Comrade Dai Dubo, and Comrade Dai Dubo also wrote a reply to Comrade Wei Wei. Through these two revolutionary letters, we can see how much spiritual strength Mao Zedong Thought can give people.
    You Have the Brightest Spiritual Eyes
    Comrade Dubo:
    Fifteen years ago, when the Korean battlefield was filled with blizzards, I went to the unit you were in. At that time, I heard other comrades talk about your struggle, which moved me deeply.
    For fifteen years, I have often thought of you. Especially when I proofread that old work that recorded your deeds, or when people mentioned this article, I would think of you. I always thought: "Where is Comrade Dai Dubo now? How is he doing now? Is he still moving forward?" But I have not been able to get any news from you. Not long ago, I returned from the Vietnam battlefield and happened to be strolling down the street when I suddenly saw your name in the newspaper column. At that time, I thought, "Could it be that Dai Dubo!" When I realized it was you, I was so excited that I stood under the newspaper column and read the entire page of articles from beginning to end without missing a word.
    Dear Comrade Dubo, the path you have traveled and the new deeds you have created on this path have given me such a strong feeling! When I think of you, a blind person, stumbling to fetch water for people and pouring bedpans for the sick; when a swine fever occurs, you personally feel your way into the pigsty to taste the pig feed; and you even use your only bit of blurry light perception to read Chairman Mao's works word by word with a magnifying glass... tears blurred my eyes, and I said to myself: What a good comrade! What a comrade with such a strong revolutionary spirit! The question that had been hanging in my mind for many years has been answered: Is Dai Dubo still moving forward? Yes, he is still moving forward! He hasn't stopped at all! And he is walking more solidly and powerfully. Every step he takes makes a loud sound. He not only did not regard the initial test fifteen years ago as the end point of progress, but regarded it as the starting point for a proletarian fighter, and climbed to a new peak step by step.
    Comrade Dai Dubo, I think the glorious deeds you have created are of great significance. This is not only because you have done many concrete things for your unit and the people around you, but also because you, like those great soldiers like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, have created a spiritual model for us. In our country, every time such a person appears, it marks the further deepening of communist ideology and Mao Zedong Thought into the hearts of the people, and marks the new position and new victory of the proletarian worldview in the battle against bourgeois ideology. We are extremely excited to see that in our vast land, the proletarian worldview is triumphing as the great revolutionary movement of studying Chairman Mao's works develops, and the ideological barriers of the bourgeoisie are collapsing one after another. A people with a brand-new spiritual outlook, a country possessing such people, is standing on this earth more and more powerfully. This is truly invincible and cannot be conquered by any enemy.
    Comrade Dai Dubo, in your glorious deeds, I think what is most educational for us is your spirit of continuous advancement and continuous revolution. It is precisely because you have this spirit that you have passed through many tests. For example, you suffered such serious injuries that you became blind, which was a serious test. A person who cannot withstand the test will not be able to stand up; secondly, having merit for the people is also a test. Making contributions is originally a good thing, but if the understanding is not correct, it will become a "burden of merit," holding people's legs and preventing them from moving forward; furthermore, isn't the peaceful life in these years also a severe test? Chairman Mao has long reminded people to be vigilant against the attacks of bourgeois "sugar-coated bullets," but haven't some people still been hit by these "bullets" and fallen? Other things like the level of position and the thickness of treatment are also quite difficult tests for a person who is worried about gains and losses and often considers "personal future"... But you have passed all these tests victoriously, which shows that you have won the battle in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. This shows that your spirit of continuous revolution and continuous transformation is very strong and worthy of our learning.
    The spirit of continuous revolution is the most precious thing in our era. Not only should the spirit of continuous revolution be reflected in social revolution, but also in personal transformation. A society needs continuous transformation, and a person also needs continuous transformation. In the period of socialist revolution, bourgeois ideology is our enemy. We must fundamentally overthrow the bourgeois ideology. We must carry out a wide, deep, and continuous attack on all aspects of bourgeois ideology. No matter how many years or generations it takes, we cannot relax our fight against it. We must not only realize a new world without exploitation on earth, but also destroy all the ideas of the exploiting classes!
    Comrade Dubo, you said: "A revolutionary, if he wants to make revolution, must first get rid of his own non-proletarian ideas." This is a very profound statement. Yes, in the struggle against bourgeois ideology, this includes revolutionizing oneself. The bourgeois ideas in one's own mind should also be regarded as one's own enemy. Under the conditions that class struggle and old ideas and old habits still exist in large numbers, even relatively pure people cannot say that they have not been tainted by any bourgeois ideas or other non-proletarian ideas. We are materialists and should have the courage to face this. We must not deceive ourselves, let alone build hiding places for our own ideas. I say this because we ourselves often easily use this or that reason to obscure our vision. No, we cannot do that. We cannot not hate bourgeois ideas in our minds, we cannot turn tumors growing on ourselves into things worth admiring.
    Comrade Dubo, why are you able to withstand the multiple tests and make the fire of life shine brighter and brighter? Why are you able to climb to the peak of a communist fighter step by step on the road of life? You answered it well, you said it was because Mao Zedong Thought gave you a pair of spiritual eyes. Yes, that is precisely the problem. In our era, only the proletarian worldview is the brightest spiritual eye. And Mao Zedong Thought is precisely the great Marxist-Leninist truth of our time, and the brilliant representative of the proletarian worldview. Whoever wants to truly acquire the proletarian worldview must seriously study Mao Zedong Thought; whoever can learn Mao Zedong Thought will have the brightest spiritual eyes.
    Dear Comrade Dai Dubo, while studying your deeds, let us take Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, the three great revolutionary movements as our battlefield, and Lei Feng and Wang Jie as our examples, and bravely attack imperialism, revisionism, and their decadent ideas, and continue to advance! May our comrades, on the road of advancement, be able to obtain the brightest spiritual eyes from Mao Zedong Thought.
    I wish you good health.
    Please give my regards to your wife and children.
    With comradely greetings,
                      Wei Wei

### 你有一双最明亮的精神眼睛

专栏：革命书信

    “六亿神州尽舜尧”。在我们国家里，有着千千万万具有坚强意志的人，戴笃伯同志就是其中的一个。过去，在抗美援朝战争中，他坚强地奋战在炮火连天的战场上；现在，在社会主义建设事业中，他克服双目失明的困难，又继续奋战在平凡的岗位上。戴笃伯同志的事迹引起许多人的感动，最近，作家魏巍同志给戴笃伯同志写了一封信，戴笃伯同志也给魏巍同志写了一封回信。通过这两封革命的书信，可以看出，毛泽东思想会使人获得多么巨大的精神力量。
    你有一双最明亮的精神眼睛笃伯同志：
    十五年前，当朝鲜战场上弥漫着漫天风雪的时候，我到了你所在的部队。当时我听了别的同志讲到你的斗争事迹，使我深受感动。
    十五年来，我时常怀念到你。尤其当我校阅记述你的事迹的那篇旧作的时候，或是在人们提到这篇文章的时候，我就想到你。我总在想：“戴笃伯同志现在在哪里？他现在怎么样了？他还在继续前进吗？”可是一直没有能够得到你的消息。不久以前，我从越南战场回来，偶然在街头散步，从贴报栏里，忽然看到了你的名字。我当时还想：“是不是那个戴笃伯呀！”等到我发现是你，真使我兴奋非常，我就站在贴报栏下，把那一大版文章一字不漏地一气读完。
    亲爱的笃伯同志，你所走过的道路，你在这条道路上创造的新的事迹，给了我多么强烈的感动呵！当我想到你，一个双目失明的人，还跌跌撞撞地为人们挑水，给病号端屎端尿；发生猪瘟的时候，还亲自摸到猪圈里去尝猪食；并且还用你仅有的一点模糊的光感，借着放大镜，一个字一个字地读毛主席的著作……泪水便模糊了我的眼睛，我对自己说：这是多么好的一个同志！这是革命精神多么旺盛的一个同志！多年来所悬念的问题得到了解答：戴笃伯在继续前进吗？是的，他在继续前进！他一步也没有停！而且他走得更加扎实，更加有力了。他的每一步都发出当当的响声，他不但没有把十五年前的最初考验当作进步的终点，而是看作一个无产阶级战士的起点，从而一步一步地又攀上了一个新的高峰。
    戴笃伯同志，我觉得你创造的光辉事迹，是有重大意义的。这不仅是你为本单位、为你周围的人们做了许许多多具体的事情，而且你象雷锋、王杰那些伟大的战士一样，为我们创造了精神上的榜样。在我们的国家里，每出现一个这样的人物，都标志着共产主义思想，毛泽东思想的更加深入人心，都标志着无产阶级的世界观在同资产阶级思想的持战中又取得了新的阵地，取得了新的胜利。我们怀着无比的兴奋看到，在我们广大的国土上，无产阶级的世界观，正随着学习毛主席著作的伟大革命运动的发展节节胜利，资产阶级的思想壁垒，正在纷纷倒塌。一个精神面貌崭新的人民，一个拥有这种人民的国家，正越来越强大地站在这个地球上了。这才是真正无敌的，是任何敌人所无法征服的。
    戴笃伯同志，在你光辉的事迹中，我觉得对我们最有教育意义的，就是你那不断前进、不断革命的精神。正是由于你具有这种精神，所以你通过了许多考验的关口。例如，你负了那么重的伤，以至双目失明，就是一个严重的考验。一个经不起考验的人，就会挺不起身子；其次，有功于人民，这也是一种考验。立功本来是好事，但是认识不正确，就会成为“功臣包袱”，抱住人的双腿不能前进；再其次，这些年的和平生活，不也是一种严峻的考验吗？毛主席早就提醒人们，要警惕资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的袭击，但是，一些人不还是被这种“炮弹”击中而倒下去了吗？其它象职位的高低，待遇的厚薄，这对一个患得患失，经常考虑“个人前途”的人，也是颇不轻松的考验……。可是以上这些关口，你都胜利地通过了，这就说明，你是在同资产阶级思想的战斗中打了胜仗。这就说明，你的不断革命，不断改造自己的精神是很强的，是值得我们学习的。
    不断革命的精神，是我们的时代中最宝贵的东西。不但在社会革命中要体现不断革命精神，在个人改造上也要体现不断革命的精神。一个社会需要不断改造，一个人也需要不断改造。在社会主义革命时期，资产阶级思想就是我们的敌人。我们必须对资产阶级的意识形态，从根本上打倒。我们必须对资产阶级思想的一切方面作广泛地、深入地、持续不断地冲击。不管需要多少年、多少代，我们都不能放松对它的战斗。我们不但要在地球上实现没有剥削制度的新世界，而且要摧毁一切剥削阶级的思想！
    笃伯同志，你说：“一个革命者，要革命就要首先革掉自己非无产阶级思想的命。”这话讲得十分深刻。是的，在同资产阶级思想的斗争中，这中间，就包括着革自己的“命”。自己头脑中的资产阶级思想，同样应当看作是自己的敌人。在阶级斗争和旧思想、旧习惯还大量存在的条件下，即使比较纯洁的人，也不能说自己就没有一点资产阶级思想以及其他非无产阶级思想的沾染。我们是唯物论者，应该有勇气正视这一点。不能蒙混自己，更不能为自己的这种思想建造隐蔽部。我这样说，是因为我们自己常常容易用这样那样的理由蒙蔽自己的视线。不，不能这样。我们不能因为资产阶级思想在自己的头脑里就不去仇恨它，我们不能因为毒瘤长在自己身上就变成值得欣赏的东西。
    笃伯同志，为什么你能够经受住重重的考验，使生命之火发出越来越明亮的光辉呢？为什么你在人生的大道上，一步一个脚印攀上一个共产主义战士的高峰呢？你回答得很好，你说这是因为毛泽东思想给了你一双精神眼睛。是的，问题正是这样。在我们的时代里，只有无产阶级的世界观，才是最明亮的精神眼睛。而毛泽东思想正是我们时代的伟大的马克思列宁主义的真理，是无产阶级世界观的光辉代表。谁要想真正取得无产阶级的世界观，谁就要认真学习毛泽东思想；谁能把毛泽东思想学到手，谁才会具有最明亮的精神眼睛。
    亲爱的戴笃伯同志，在学习你的事迹的时候，让我们以毛泽东思想为武器，以三大革命运动为战场，以雷锋、王杰为榜样，向着帝国主义、修正主义以及它们的腐朽思想勇猛冲击，不断前进！愿我们的同志，在前进的道路上，都能够从毛泽东思想里取得一双最明亮的精神眼睛。
    祝你身体健康。
    请代我问候你的妻子和孩子们。
    谨致战友的敬礼
                      魏巍
        一九六五年十二月二十七日
