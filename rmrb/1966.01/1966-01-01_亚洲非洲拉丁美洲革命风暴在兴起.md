    The world is progressing, and the future is bright. No one can change this general historical trend.
    Revolutionary Storms Rising in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
    In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the past year has been one of great upsurge in revolutionary storms, a year in which the people of various countries have achieved successive victories in the anti-imperialist struggle, and a year in which the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism have suffered successive defeats. This region, which accounts for the vast majority of the world's population and is the region where contemporary world contradictions are concentrated, is currently the main region of the world revolutionary storm directly striking imperialism.
    Asia
    In Asia, the flames of war against U.S. imperialist aggression are spreading and expanding. The heroic Vietnamese people stand on the front lines of the anti-U.S. struggle, and in the past year, they have beaten the U.S. invading forces into disarray. The U.S. aggressors face imminent disaster in the sea of people's war in South Vietnam. Unwilling to accept defeat, they are planning to spread the flames of aggressive war to the entire Indochina. The Lao Patriotic Armed Forces have continuously crushed the armed offensives of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in the past year, defending the liberated areas that account for two-thirds of the country's land and one-half of the population, and their strength is growing. They are preparing to use more heroic battles to crush the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to expand the war. The Cambodian people have been waging a tit-for-tat struggle against the U.S. imperialist activities of aggression and subversion. In May of last year, in order to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity, they resolutely rejected "U.S. aid" and severed diplomatic relations with the United States. The Cambodian government has solemnly announced that it will use its own military means to counter any encroachment on Cambodia. If the U.S. aggressors, already battered by the Vietnamese people, continue to act wilfully, they will suffer even greater defeats.
    In the past year, the Korean people and the Japanese people have bravely carried out struggles against the "South Korea-Japan Treaty" planned single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, and against U.S. imperialism using South Korea and Japan as accomplices in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. The number and scale of participants in the struggle were unprecedented, placing U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in serious isolation. The Thai people, under the leadership of the "Patriotic Front of Thailand," have begun fighting against the United States and its Bangkok puppets. Even in the Philippines, which is under strict U.S. control, and "Malaysia," a product of British-American neo-colonialism, national independence movements are rising, and guerrilla fighters continue to strengthen their activities. The people of North Kalimantan are also engaged in armed confrontation with the colonialists. The Pakistani people successfully repulsed the invasion of the Indian reactionaries supported by U.S. imperialism.
    Africa
    In Africa, the struggle against imperialism and colonialism is moving forward. At the beginning of last year, the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism in subverting Tanzania and invading Uganda were immediately exposed and countered. In the past year, the armed struggle for national independence in Congo (Leopoldville) has continued to expand. The patriotic armed forces in Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde have made considerable progress. Nationalists in Rhodesia and South Africa are also engaged in increasingly fierce resistance. Not long ago, the African people's support for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe opened a new chapter in the African anti-imperialist struggle. The days of imperialism and its running dogs are getting harder and harder.
    Latin America
    In Latin America, the past year has also been full of revolutionary storms. The Dominican people, in April, held high the banner of anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorial righteousness, which shook the world. U.S. imperialism dispatched tens of thousands of bandit troops to suppress them. However, for more than eight months, the U.S. aggressors' military suppression and political deception have not subdued the Dominican people. Currently, from cities to the countryside, the Dominican people are persisting in the anti-U.S. struggle. The U.S. armed intervention in the Dominican Republic has aroused a huge anti-U.S. wave in Latin America. The guerrilla fighters in Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and other countries who have already risen to fight have continued to make progress in difficult environments this year, greatly encouraging the morale of the people. U.S. imperialism's attempt to use the "Pan American Conference" to extinguish the people's resistance movement with a "fire brigade" was thwarted. U.S. dignitaries have been traveling around Latin America, only to be spurned by the people everywhere. U.S. imperialism can never have a "peaceful backyard" again.
    The revolutionary situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is excellent, and this is the main trend. Although U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are struggling and stirring up one countercurrent after another, they cannot stop the people from achieving one victory after another. The current era is one in which the east wind is blowing strongly, and the vast number of people are standing up. The oppressed and enslaved people dare to stand up and fight, and no matter how many twists and turns and difficulties lie ahead, they will surely achieve final victory and bury all the demons and monsters of imperialism and reactionaries!

    The Vietnamese people are using people's war to strike hard at the U.S. aggressors. This is the bugler of the heroic South Vietnamese Liberation Army, sounding the call to battle.
    The African people support the Zimbabwean people's struggle against colonial rule, opening a new chapter in the African anti-imperialist struggle. The picture shows the Ethiopian people holding a demonstration.
    The Dominican people resolutely oppose U.S. armed intervention. The Dominican in the picture glares at the U.S. invading army, showing deep hatred and fearless spirit.

### 亚洲非洲拉丁美洲革命风暴在兴起

    世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。
    亚洲非洲拉丁美洲革命风暴在兴起
    在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，过去的一年是革命风暴大大兴起的一年，是各国人民在反帝斗争中接连取得胜利的一年，是美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策接连失败的一年。这个占世界人口绝大多数的地区，当代世界各种矛盾集中的地区，是目前直接打击帝国主义的世界革命风暴的主要地区。亚洲
    在亚洲，反对美帝国主义侵略战争的烽火在延烧，在扩展。英雄的越南人民站在反美斗争的最前哨，一年来把美国侵略军队打得丢盔弃甲，狼狈万状。美国侵略者在南越的人民战争的海洋里，面临灭顶之灾。它不甘心失败，正策划把侵略战火烧到整个印度支那。老挝爱国军民一年来不断粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的武装进攻，保卫着占全国三分之二土地和二分之一人口的解放区，力量日益壮大。他们正准备用更英勇的战斗，来粉碎美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋。柬埔寨人民一直同美帝国主义的侵略颠覆活动进行着针锋相对的斗争，去年五月为了维护国家主权和尊严，毅然拒绝了“美援”，并且同美国绝交。柬埔寨政府已经庄严宣布，将以自己所拥有的军事手段回击对柬埔寨的任何侵犯。已经被越南人民打得焦头烂额的美国侵略者如果继续一意孤行，必将遭到更大的失败。
    在过去的一年里，朝鲜人民和日本人民曾经英勇地进行了反对由美帝国主义一手策划的“韩日条约”的斗争，反对美帝国主义利用南朝鲜和日本充当美国侵越帮凶，参加斗争的人数和规模都是空前的，使得美帝国主义及其走卒陷于严重的孤立。泰国人民在“泰国爱国阵线”的领导下开始了反对美国及其曼谷傀儡的战斗。即使在美国严密控制下的菲律宾，美英制造的新殖民主义产物的“马来西亚”，民族独立运动也在兴起，游击战士在继续加强活动。北加里曼丹人民也在同殖民者进行武装对抗。巴基斯坦人民胜利地阻击了美帝国主义支持的印度反动派的侵犯。非洲
    在非洲，反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争在向前推进。去年年初，美帝国主义颠覆坦桑尼亚和侵犯乌干达的罪恶行为遭到即时的揭露和回击。一年来，刚果（利）争取民族独立的武装斗争仍在继续扩展。安哥拉、莫三鼻给和葡属几内亚与佛得角的爱国武装都取得不少进展。罗得西亚和南非的民族主义战士也都在进行日益激烈的反抗。不久前，非洲人民支持津巴布韦人民的斗争，揭开了非洲反帝斗争的新篇章。帝国主义及其走狗的日子越来越不好过。拉丁美洲
    在拉丁美洲，过去一年也充满了革命风暴。多米尼加人民在四月里高举反美反独裁义旗，震动了世界。美帝国主义出动几万名强盗军队前去镇压。但八个多月来，美国侵略者的军事镇压和政治欺骗并没有压服多米尼加人民。目前，从城市到农村，多米尼加人民坚持着反美斗争。美国对多米尼加的武装干涉在拉丁美洲激起巨大的反美怒潮。那些已经起来进行战斗的哥伦比亚、秘鲁、委内瑞拉等国的游击战士，这一年里在艰苦的环境里继续取得进展，大大地鼓舞了人民的斗志。美帝国主义曾经企图利用“泛美会议”组织扑灭人民反抗运动的“救火队”这个阴谋遭到挫折。美国大员到拉丁美洲四出活动，到处遭到人民的唾弃。美帝国主义永远不可能再有什么“平静的后院”了。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命形势大好，这是主流。美帝国主义及其走狗虽然在挣扎，在掀起一股又一股的逆流，但却阻挡不住人民取得了一个又一个胜利。当前是东风劲吹的时代，是广大人民翻身的时代。被压迫被奴役的人民敢于站起来斗争，不管前途还有多少曲折和困难，一定能取得最后胜利，把帝国主义和反动派这些妖魔鬼怪统统埋葬掉！（附图片）
    越南人民用人民战争痛击美国侵略者。这是英雄的南越解放军的司号员，正在吹起战斗的号角。

    多米尼加人民坚决反对美国武装干涉。图中这个多米尼加人横眉怒视美国侵略军，表现了深刻的仇恨和无畏的精神。
