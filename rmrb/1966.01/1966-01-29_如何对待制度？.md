    How to Treat Systems?
    Beijing Printing and Dyeing Factory Workers Chen Chongfu Du Changyi
    Not long ago, something like this happened in our factory: the downstream process received more than two hundred pieces of cloth from the upstream process and discovered serious "weft skew" defects. According to the rules and regulations, this process could completely return the goods to the original process for rework. However, an old worker kept these cloths and tried every means on the machine in this process to rework and salvage them, finally turning most of the products into qualified products, ensuring product quality and normal production order. Why was he not afraid to take responsibility and dared to rush to solve difficulties and provide convenience? He answered well: "The system is dead, but people are alive. As long as it is beneficial to product quality and the entire production, why must we rigidly adhere to the system?"
    This remark makes sense. Such people have the system in their hearts, but they care more about production. They are not bound by the system and clearly recognize that the system is a means to improve production, not an end in itself.
    However, some comrades, regardless of the situation, follow the rules, and as a result, they get trapped in a metaphysical circle that only cares about the system and not the results. We must thoroughly overcome the metaphysical thinking in the implementation of the system, correctly treat the rules and regulations, and thus promote the production upsurge of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other.

    如何对待制度？
    北京印染厂工人　陈崇福　杜长义
    不久前，我们厂曾经发生这样一件事：下工序收到上工序两百多匹布，发现有严重的“纬斜”疵点。按照规章制度，这个工序完全可以退回原工序进行回修。可是，一位老工人却把这些布留下来，在本工序的机台上千方百计地进行回修抢救，终于使大部分产品变成了正品，保障了产品质量和正常生产秩序。为什么他不怕承担责任、敢于抢困难送方便？他回答得好：“制度是死的，人是活的。只要对产品质量和整个生产有好处，为什么一定要死抱住制度不放？”
    这一番话说得有道理。这样的人，他们心里有制度，但更有生产，不为制度所束缚，明确认识制度是搞好生产的手段，而不是目的。
    但是，也有的同志不管什么情况，都按框框来，结果，钻进了只管制度不管结果的形而上学的圈子里。我们必须彻底克服执行制度上的形而上学思想，正确对待规章制度，从而促进比学赶帮超的生产高潮。
