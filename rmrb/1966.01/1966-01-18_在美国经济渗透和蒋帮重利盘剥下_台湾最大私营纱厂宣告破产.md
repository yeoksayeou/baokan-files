    Under American economic penetration and the Chiang gang's heavy exploitation,
    Taiwan's largest private textile mill declares bankruptcy
    Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 17th—Da Qin Textile Company, the largest private textile factory in Taiwan, recently declared bankruptcy and was forced into public auction under American economic penetration and the Chiang gang's heavy exploitation.
    According to Taiwan newspapers, Da Qin Textile Company has more than 43,000 spindles and more than 600 looms, with a capital of NT$600 million and nearly 2,000 employees, making it the largest private textile mill in Taiwan. Taiwan's *Zhengxin News* reported that with the very poor condition of the Taiwan textile industry, "Da Qin" deteriorated and became heavily indebted. On December 21, 1965, it was forced to sell all its factory buildings and machinery for NT$97.08 million to the Chiang gang's "Taiwan Bank," and the final procedures were completed on December 27.
    Taiwan newspapers revealed that the American aggressors' control and attack on Taiwan's textile mills and the Chiang gang's heavy exploitation have severely devastated Taiwan's textile industry. The bankruptcy of Da Qin Textile Company is one example. A Taiwan newspaper said in a news report titled *Talking about the Textile Industry from Da Qin Auction* that more than 95% of the natural cotton used by Taiwan's textile mills is imported from the United States. These mills "clearly know that cotton from other countries is cheaper than American cotton, but because of [U.S.-Chiang] regulations, they still buy expensive American cotton," because "the high price of cotton affects the cost of spinning, making it unprofitable for textile mills." In addition, due to the "import of foreign synthetic fibers," which flooded the Taiwan market, the sales of Taiwan textiles have been even more seriously affected. Under such circumstances, Da Qin Textile Company was not only unable to increase production but also suffered from financial difficulties. The news also revealed that when Da Qin Company needed funds, the Chiang gang's "Taiwan Bank" took the opportunity to provide high-interest loans calculated at a monthly interest rate of 2.1% compound interest, causing it to "sink deeper and deeper, unable to extricate itself," and finally had to declare bankruptcy.
    Taiwan newspapers also said that some people in Taiwan's textile industry expressed sympathy for the misfortune of "Da Qin." They believe that some of the old shareholders of "Da Qin" had been engaged in the textile industry in the motherland for decades and had in-depth research on management and technology. After arriving in Taiwan, today they have come to "such an end, it is really pitiful." At the time of the "Da Qin" auction, looking at the future of the entire textile industry in Taiwan, it is really "alarming and fearful."

### 在美国经济渗透和蒋帮重利盘剥下  台湾最大私营纱厂宣告破产

    在美国经济渗透和蒋帮重利盘剥下
    台湾最大私营纱厂宣告破产
    新华社十七日讯　台北消息：台湾私营纺织厂中规模最大的一家大秦纺织公司，在美国经济渗透和蒋帮重利盘剥下，最近宣告破产，被迫公开拍卖。
    据台湾报纸报道，大秦纺织公司拥有纱锭四万三千多枚，布机六百多台，资本额六亿元台币，员工近两千人，是台湾私营纱厂中规模最大的一家。台湾《征信新闻报》说，随着台湾纺织工业的很不景气，“大秦”也就每况愈下，负债累累，一九六五年十二月二十一日被迫将全部厂房、机器设备作价九千七百零八万元台币卖给蒋帮“台湾银行”，十二月二十七日移交了最后一道手续。
    台湾报纸透露，美国侵略者对台湾纱厂的控制打击和蒋帮的重利盘剥，使台湾的纺织业受到严重摧残，大秦纺织公司的破产就是其中一例。台湾一家报纸在《由大秦拍卖谈到纺织界》的新闻通讯中说，台湾纱厂所用的天然棉百分之九十五以上是由美国进口。这些纱厂“明明知道其它国家棉花比美国的价钱低，因限于（美蒋）规定，仍然买美国高价棉花”，因为“棉价过高，影响纺纱成本，使纱厂无利可图”。另外，由于“外货合成纤维的进口”，充斥台湾市场，使台湾纺织品的销路更受严重影响。大秦纺织公司在这种情况下，不仅无法提高生产，而且资金周转失灵。消息还透露，蒋帮“台湾银行”在大秦公司需要资金周转时，便乘机投放按月息二分一厘复利计算的高利贷，使它“愈陷愈深，不可自拔”，最后只好宣告破产。
    台湾报纸还说，台湾有些纺织界人士对“大秦”的厄运表示同情，他们认为“大秦”公司的一些旧股东过去在祖国大陆，曾经营纺织业数十年，对于管理和技术方面都有很深的研究，到台湾以后，今天落个“这样的下场实在太可怜了”。在“大秦”拍卖之际，再看台湾省整个纺织业的前途，实在“令人慌恐和戒惧”。
