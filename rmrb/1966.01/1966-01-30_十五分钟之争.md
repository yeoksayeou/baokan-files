    Fifteen-Minute Dispute
    Editor's Note: Some people think, "Political work can be done during business downtime, but not when business is busy." Others think, "Doing political work will delay business." Are these views correct? Please find the answer from the following facts.
    On the eve of the 1964 National Day, the courtyard of the Egg Wholesale Department of the Beijing Food Company was bustling with activity. Trucks from the transportation company lined up in front of the warehouse doors, waiting to be loaded.
    That day was September 27th, and the peak season for fresh eggs was already in its late stages. Large quantities of fresh eggs that had been inspected by candling were piled up like mountains in the warehouse, and the supply was very abundant. According to general practice, these fresh eggs stored in the cold storage could be released to the market at any time. However, at that time, the higher authorities decided that in order to ensure the quality of goods in the holiday market, all of them must be inspected again by candling. Time was tight, and the task was heavy. The fresh egg candling workers were operating nervously and were still unable to keep up, causing vehicle congestion.
    What to do? Several people in charge of the wholesale department jointly studied and decided to work overtime to candle, preparing part of the inventory. At this time, a dispute arose: some advocated doing political work for fifteen minutes before working overtime, explaining why it was necessary to work overtime. Some said, "What's the point of mobilization? It's better to use fifteen minutes to candle two more boxes of eggs!" Others said, "People who do political work are just troublemakers!" Later, after some discussion, a consensus was reached: regardless of whether business is busy or not, politics should command business.
    After dinner, a general meeting of all employees was held. Fifteen minutes were used to explain the great political significance of ensuring commodity quality and doing a good job in holiday supply, calling on cadres and workers, except those with children and the weak, to voluntarily participate in overtime candling. As a result, more than 30,000 jin of candling tasks were completed within two hours, equivalent to half a day's work for these people on weekdays, preparing nearly half of the goods for market supply the next day. Afterwards, the workers said, "Mobilization is good, the heart is bright, and the enthusiasm is also up." "In the past, we just did things with an order, and we were confused, and the efficiency was not high." Through this matter, the leading cadres of this wholesale department realized: political work is effective!

    十五分钟之争
    编者按　有人认为：“政治工作在业务空闲的时候可以做，业务忙了就不能做。”还有人认为：“做政治工作会耽误营业。”这些看法对不对呢？请从下面的事实中寻找答案吧。
    一九六四年国庆节前夕，北京市食品公司蛋品批发部院子里车水马龙。运输公司的汽车一辆辆排在库房门前，等待装车。
    那天是九月二十七日，鲜蛋旺季已经进入后期，库内经过照灯检查的大批鲜蛋堆积如山，货源非常充足。按照一般常规，这些存入冷库的鲜蛋即可随时投放市场。可是，当时上级决定，为了保证节日市场的商品质量，一律要再次照灯检查。时间紧，任务大，鲜蛋照灯工人紧张操作，还忙不过来，造成了车辆积压。
    怎么办呢？批发部几个负责人共同研究，决定加班照灯，准备部分库存。就在这时候，发生了一个争论：有人主张加班以前先用十五分钟做做政治工作，讲清为什么要加班。有人却说：“做什么动员，还不如用十五分钟多照两箱鸡蛋呢！”也有人说：“做政治工作的人就是事多！”后来，经过一番议论，还是统一了认识：不论业务忙闲，都应该政治统帅业务。
    饭后，召开了全体职工大会，用十五分钟的时间讲清了保证商品质量，做好节日供应的重大政治意义，号召干部、工人，除带小孩和体弱的以外，自愿参加加班照灯。结果在两小时内就完成了三万多斤的照灯任务，相当于这些人平日半天的劳动量，为第二天市场供应准备出近一半的货源。事后，职工们说：“动员一下，就是好，心里亮了，干劲也来了。”“过去一道命令就干，心里糊里糊涂的，效率也不高。”通过这件事情，这个批发部的领导干部们都认识到：政治工作就是灵！
