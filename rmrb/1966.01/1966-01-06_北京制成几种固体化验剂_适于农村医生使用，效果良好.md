	Beijing's Tiantan Hospital's Department of Laboratory Medicine has produced several solid reagents, greatly simplifying experimental diagnostic work for doctors for certain diseases.
	After Beijing medical personnel went to the countryside last year to carry out mobile medical work, they felt it was very inconvenient to carry many laboratory equipment and chemical reagents over mountains and rivers, which easily affected work efficiency. In response to this situation, the staff of the Department of Laboratory Medicine of Tiantan Hospital carried out scientific research work. With the strong support of the hospital's Party committee and the assistance of the staff of the Pharmacy Department, after two months of repeated experiments, they finally successfully trial-produced six kinds of reagent tablets. When these reagents come into contact with a patient's urine or feces, they can quickly provide experimental diagnoses for diseases such as diabetes, gastrointestinal ulcers, nephritis, hepatitis, biliary tract diseases, jaundice, and diabetic ketoacidosis, with the same effects as those done in the laboratory in the past. These solid reagents are very small and can be stored in a small box.
	Rural half-farmer, half-doctor doctors and health workers can master their use after only two or three hours of study, and the cost is also low.

    北京制成几种固体化验剂
    适于农村医生使用，效果良好
    北京市天坛医院检验科制成几种固体化验剂，使医生对某些疾病的实验诊断工作大大简化了。
    去年北京市医务人员到农村开展巡回医疗工作以后，感到携带许多化验设备和化学试剂跋山涉水很不方便，容易影响工作效率。针对这一情况，天坛医院检验科的工作人员进行了科学研究工作。他们在医院党委的大力支持下，取得药剂科工作人员的协助，经过两个月反复试验，终于试制成功六种化验片剂。用这种化验剂和病人的小便或粪便一接触，就能对糖尿病、肠胃?疡、肾炎、肝炎、胆道疾患、黄胆、糖尿病酸中毒等疾病迅速提供实验诊断，效果和过去在化验室里做的完全一样。这几种固体化验剂的体积很小，用一个小盒子就能装下。
    农村半农半医的医生和卫生员，只要学习两三个小时就能掌握，成本也低。
