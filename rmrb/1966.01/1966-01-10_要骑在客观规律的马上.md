    To Ride on the Horse of Objective Laws
    Jie Yue, Fine Yarn Spinner, Taiyuan Textile Factory, Shanxi

    Many comrades want me to talk about how I transformed from unfreedom to freedom in mastering the fine yarn machine. To operate a machine well, spin more yarn, and spin good yarn involves many factors, requiring both solid ideology and solid technique. In terms of technique, it includes many operations such as yarn joining, bobbin changing, patrolling, and cleaning. Failure in any one of these aspects will prevent one from operating the machine well. To be more focused and clearer, I will only introduce my process of exploring the yarn joining laws.

        Everything in the world develops according to laws.
    Only by recognizing the laws and acting according to them can things be done well.

    Yarn joining is one of the most basic operations for a fine yarn spinner. To ensure that each spindle can spin yarn continuously, every yarn break must be joined as quickly as possible, while ensuring that the joined area has even yarn count and no slubs; otherwise, it will be impossible to control the machine, reducing production efficiency and quality, and causing a large waste of raw materials. Therefore, the spinner must first learn how to join yarn, and moreover, master the yarn joining technique well.

    Because yarn joining is very important, the workshop regularly tests the yarn joining technique of each spinner. Originally, this was a good way to check whether a spinner’s technique was solid, but some people felt that "testing is a gamble"; they thought that doing well in the test was "hitting" it right, and doing poorly was not "hitting" it right. When I first entered the factory, I had this kind of understanding of technical testing. I remember one test where I did very poorly, almost ranking last among the four hundred-plus spinners in the entire workshop.

    Failing once, failing twice, failing three times, why did I always fail? Why did the veteran workers always succeed every time? Facing these questions, my idea that "testing is a gamble" began to waver. No, I was not reconciled, I was not convinced, I did not believe that I could never improve. The masters told me, "One must be strong oneself to forge iron," without mastering the skill of joining yarn, it is absolutely impossible to do well in the test by "gambling." In this way, I focused all my attention on the operating methods, memorized the seven steps of yarn joining firmly, reciting them by heart, and doing exactly as stipulated in the manual. This improved the quality of the joined yarn compared to before, but it became shaky and unstable; sometimes there were no slubs at all, sometimes there were many slubs, even large slubs. More seriously, when the quality of the joined yarn was good, I didn't know the secret; when I joined a large slub, I couldn't find the reason, and learning from mistakes was impossible. In a word, I was still blind in the operation, resulting in feeling powerless.

    Seeing the masters' high level of skill, I was truly envious. Therefore, whenever I had time, I would go to their machines to watch them thoroughly. Watching others operate so freely and with such high quality, but feeling so awkward when I operated, joining one large slub after another, I was really unconvinced and kept looking for my own problems. At first, I felt that I had not mastered the operating methods well. Later, in studying Chairman Mao's works, I discovered my fatal weakness: not recognizing and mastering the yarn joining laws.

    Finding the problem made me extremely happy. I said to myself: I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, discover the yarn joining laws, and turn the subjective desire of joining yarn with no white spots into an objective reality!

        To recognize and master objective laws, one must
    constantly summarize experience from practice.

    When I first entered the factory, I used the "single-hand untwisting, horizontally feeding from right to left" yarn joining method. This yarn joining method is as follows: when the fine yarn on the spinning machine breaks, first find the broken end on the yarn tube, untwist it, and then feed it horizontally from right to left towards the roving (the cotton sliver about to be spun into fine yarn) that is flowing continuously from top to bottom, so that the broken end of the fine yarn and the roving twist together automatically.

    When I first used this yarn joining method, slubs always appeared, and I didn't know why they appeared. I was really unfree. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works and improving my awareness of exploring objective laws, I paid attention to studying the problems in my own operation, and discovered the first problem with my use of the "single-hand untwisting, horizontally feeding from right to left" yarn joining method: the untwisted yarn end had no fuzziness; without fuzziness, the cotton fibers of the broken end and the roving could not twist together evenly, and slubs were bound to appear.

    How to untwist the fine yarn end to produce fuzziness? Two methods were before me: first, create myself; second, learn from the masses. At that time, I thought that these two methods should be pursued simultaneously. So, while I pondered, I also looked for experience among the comrades. After searching, I found that Master Xu Shuhui untwisted the fine yarn ends with fuzziness.

    I immediately asked Master Xu for advice. She told me that after holding the yarn loosely with her thumb and forefinger, she gently twisted the yarn backward with her thumb, untwisting the yarn and snapping it off, and fuzziness would appear. Master Xu's words enlightened me: I had been twisting too hard, using too much force, resulting in twisting the yarn open and then twisting it tight again. Using Master Xu's experience of "light" resulted in my untwisting fuzziness, and I felt unspeakably happy. In the past, I often said that I wanted to learn from the masses. This time, I really tasted the sweetness of learning from the masses.

    After overcoming the first problem, I discovered a second problem. Even if I untwisted the broken end with fuzziness, I still sometimes joined a large slub. What was the reason for this? I looked for experience among the comrades again, and found that Master Li Guiying was very steady when feeding the broken end horizontally from right to left, allowing the broken end and the roving to twist together naturally. Master Li's steady experience enlightened me again: I had been feeding too fast; feeding too fast easily blocked the flowing roving suddenly, causing it to pile up into a round slub.

    The experience of the masses is like a ladder to reach an advanced level, as long as you learn from it carefully, one experience at a time, it will enable you to move upward step by step, improve your ability to recognize objective laws, and master the ability to control objective laws.

        After summarizing the experience of the masses, it is
    also necessary to test these experiences in one's own
    practice, absorb what is useful, reject
    what is not useful, and add what is unique to oneself.

    Chairman Mao said in "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," when talking about learning from others' war experience: "These bloody lessons left to us by past wars should be emphasized. This is one thing. But there is another thing, that is, to verify these conclusions from one's own experience, absorb those that are useful, reject those that are useless, and add those that are unique to oneself." Encouraged by Chairman Mao's teaching, while learning and summarizing the experience of the masses, I boldly conducted experiments and added things that were unique to myself.

    In using the "single-hand untwisting, horizontally feeding from right to left" yarn joining method, after I used Master Xu Shuhui's "light" to overcome my "heavy" and Master Li Guiying's "steady" to overcome my "fast," the yarn joining quality increased from 60% to 85%, that is, ensuring that 85 out of 100 joined yarn ends had no slubs. But this already achieved quality standard could not satisfy me. Because the workshop's target was 90%, I had not reached it; it was even farther from my own target, that is, yarn joining with no white spots (slubs).

    At that time, only a few people in the workshop occasionally reached the workshop's target once or twice. Facing this fact, I suspected that there was a problem with the yarn joining method itself.

    Just at this time, a "single-hand snapping, feeding from right to left and upward" yarn joining method was introduced from another place. I compared this new yarn joining method with the original "single-hand untwisting, horizontally feeding from right to left" yarn joining method. From the comparison, I found that the first advantage of this new method was that it directly joined the snapped end without untwisting, reducing one step and saving time; the second advantage was that the snapped end was vertical, which was convenient for positioning during yarn joining.

    In the process of practice, I also found that this new yarn joining method had three weaknesses: first, when feeding the yarn end upward, it was required that the yarn end and the roving be separated by a distance of one yarn, and this distance was difficult to grasp; second, the angle of feeding from left and upward was small, which easily became horizontal feeding, returning to the shortcomings of the first type of yarn joining method; third, it was difficult to grasp how high to feed, and where to feed, and if not done well, the yarn end would touch the roving, and a slub would be formed.

    In the case where both yarn joining methods had advantages and disadvantages, I was determined to explore a better yarn joining method that could ensure the quality of yarn joining.

      In "training," I began to experiment with the direction of feeding the yarn, and each experiment was conducted sequentially from the four directions of feeding from the right, feeding from the left, horizontal feeding, and straight feeding, with ten yarn ends joined in each direction. Each yarn joint in each direction was carefully observed.

    From the observation, I found that the yarn ends joined in the first three directions had more slubs, and even those without slubs could clearly see the interface between the yarns. Only the yarn ends joined in the direction of straight feeding were surprising: if there were slubs, they were large slubs, and those without slubs could not even see the interface between the yarns. After many repeated experiments, the result was the same. Therefore, I became interested in straight feeding and concentrated my energy on feeding straight.

    Each time in "training", I joined many yarn ends from the direction of straight feeding in succession. After joining them, the ones with slubs were untwisted for dissection and analysis. Such dissection revealed two situations in the yarn joints with slubs: one type, the slub was at the upper end of the yarn joint, obviously due to the yarn end being fed too low and touching the roving upward, causing the roving to fold back; the other type, the slub was at the lower end of the yarn joint, also obviously due to feeding the yarn too fast, causing the yarn end to fold back.

    I thought, if the roving was not folded back, and the yarn end was not folded back, could the quality of the yarn joint be fully guaranteed! Sure enough, looking at the yarn joints that had been dissected and had no interfaces, it confirmed my judgment. Thus, in my mind, I affirmed the method of joining yarn from the direction of straight feeding.

    But, to use it, the two problems mentioned earlier had to be solved, that is, neither allowing the roving to be touched back, nor allowing the yarn end to be folded back.

    Not allowing the roving to be touched back required that the yarn end not be fed too low. How to feed the yarn end to the right position? I absorbed the single action of positioning in the upper middle part of the roller in the yarn joining method introduced from another place to ensure accurate position, and solved the problem of inaccurate yarn end position.

    Not allowing the yarn end to be folded back required that the yarn end not be fed too fast. I absorbed the single action of steady horizontal feeding when joining yarn in the original yarn joining method, overcoming the problem of being fast.

    On the basis of absorbing the advantages of the new and old yarn joining methods, I summarized another yarn joining method – the "align roving and feed straight" yarn joining method.

    After this yarn joining method appeared, I also absorbed the advantage of light yarn end release from the doffing expert Shi Yuzhen, and developed it, summarizing the "align roving, feed straight, and lightly support upward" yarn joining method. Following this, I absorbed the advantage of vertical snapping from Master Zhang Lixiang, and developed it, changing her long snapping end to a short snapping end.

    The result of using this yarn joining method was that the yarn joining quality reached 95%.

        After summarizing the new yarn joining method, it is also
    necessary to continuously test and enrich it from the
    practice of the masses and one's own practice.

      After the "align roving, feed straight, and lightly support upward" yarn joining method appeared, the leadership attached great importance to it. It was quickly spread to textile factories throughout the province. Comrades from Jinhua Textile Factory wanted me to perform. After the performance, I found that Master Tan Yingmei snapped the end and rotated the anti-ballooning hook screw simultaneously during yarn joining, which was very fast. I, on the other hand, rotated the anti-ballooning hook screw and then lifted the yarn to snap the end, wasting time. After returning from the performance, I added this experience to my yarn joining method, increasing the number of yarn joints per minute from 14 to 17.

    When the provincial textile industry labor models came to our factory to perform, I also found that Master Gong Caiyan from Jinsheng Textile Factory held the yarn tube diagonally. The lower end of the yarn tube was directly facing the spindle, so the insertion was accurate and fast. I, on the other hand, held the yarn tube straight, the lower end of the yarn tube was not directly facing the spindle, and the insertion was inaccurate and slow. So, I added Master Gong's diagonal holding of the yarn tube action to my yarn joining method. The speed of yarn joining increased again from 17 yarn joints per minute to 19.

    From the "single-hand untwisting, horizontally feeding from right to left" yarn joining method, to the "single-hand snapping, feeding from right to left and upward" yarn joining method, and then to the "align roving, feed straight, and lightly support upward" yarn joining method, and now further enriching it to the "align roving and lightly support" yarn joining method, this is my process of exploring the yarn joining laws. Today, this process is not over yet, because I have only achieved "basically no white spots in yarn joining," and have not completely turned the subjective desire of no white spots in yarn joining into an objective reality.

    要骑在客观规律的马上
    山西太原纺织厂细纱挡车工　解悦
    很多同志要我谈谈在掌握细纱机的过程中，是如何从不自由变为自由的。要看好车，多纺纱，纺好纱，牵涉的因素很多，既要有过硬的思想，又得有过硬的技术。在技术方面，又包括接头、换纱、巡回和清洁工作等许多操作，有一项不过硬也不能把车看好。为了说得集中、清楚一些，我只介绍自己摸索接头规律的过程。
        世界上万事万物都是有规律地发展的，
    只有认识规律，按规律办事，事情才能办好
    接头，是细纱挡车工的一项最基本的操作。为了使每个锭子都能不停地纺纱，必须最迅速地接好每根断头，同时要保证接头处条干均匀，没有圪?，否则，就无法驾驭机台，使生产效率和质量降低，造成原材料的大量浪费。因此，挡车工首先得学会接头，而且，要很好地掌握接头技术。
    因为接头很重要，所以车间经常测定每一个挡车工的接头技术。本来，这是一种检查挡车工技术过硬不过硬的好方法，但是有些人却感到“测定是个碰”；认为测定得好是“碰”对了，测定不好是没“碰”对。我刚入厂的时候，对于技术测定，就是这样一种认识。记得有一次测定，我考得很不好，在全车间四百多名挡车工中，几乎落了个倒数第一名。
    一次碰不好，两次碰不好，三次碰不好，为什么我老是碰不好呢？为什么老工人们又总是次次都碰得好呢？面对着这些问题，使我对于“测定是个碰”的想法动摇了。不好，我不甘心，我不服气，我就不相信永远好不了。师傅们告诉我，“打铁先得本身硬”，接头的本事没有学到手，要想凭“碰”来测定好，那是万万不可能的事情。就这样，我一心钻到了操作法里，把接头那七个动作，记的牢靠，背的烂熟，一字不差地按照本本上的规定干。这一下虽然接下的头不象以前那样不好了，可是，又成了个摇摇摆摆的样子，质量很不稳定；有时一点圪?也没有，有时圪?就多，甚至有大圪?。更严重的是，接头的质量好了，自己不知道奥妙在哪里，得不到经验；接了大圪?头，也找不出原因来，吃了“堑”也长不了“智”。一句话，在操作当中还是盲目的，结果弄得自己有劲使不上。
    自己不行，看着师傅们技术那样高，心里真羡慕。因此，一有空我就跑到她们的车上看个够。看着别人操作起来这样自由自在，质量那么高。自己一上车干，那么别别扭扭，一接一个大圪?，心里实在不服气，我一个劲寻找自己的毛病。开始，觉得是对操作法掌握得不好。后来，在学习毛主席的著作中，我才发现了自己的致命弱点：没有认识和掌握接头的规律。
    毛病找到了，我心里高兴的不得了。我对自己说：一定要按照毛主席的教导，把接头的规律摸到，把接头无白点的主观愿望变成客观现实！
        要认识和掌握客观规律，就得不断从实
    践中去总结经验
    我刚进厂的时候，使用的是“单手解捻、从右向左平送”的接头法。这种接头法是这样的：当纺纱机上的细纱断了之后，先找出细纱管上的断头，把它捻开，然后从右向左平平地对着正在自上而下不停地流动着的须条（即将纺成细纱的棉花条）送过去，使细纱断头和须条自行捻合。
    最初使用这种接头法的时候，总是出现圪?，而且，出了圪?还不知道为什么，实在不自由。后来，学习了毛主席的著作，提高了摸索客观规律的自觉性之后，我才注意研究自己操作上的问题，才发现了自己使用“单手解捻、从右向左平送”接头法当中第一个毛病：解捻出来的纱头，没有绒度；没有绒度，就不能使断头和须条的棉绒均匀地捻合，必然要出现圪?。
    怎么才能把细纱断头解捻出绒度来呢？摆在我面前的办法有两个：第一，自己创造；第二，向群众学习。当时我想，这两个方法要双管齐下。于是，我一边琢磨，一边就在同志们当中寻找经验。找来找去，找到了：许淑嫒师傅解捻出来的细纱断头有绒度。
    我立即向许师傅请教。她告诉我说：用拇指和食指松松地捏住纱以后，拇指轻轻把纱往后捻，把纱捻开，一崩断，绒度就出来了。许师傅一句话，把我点明了：原来我捻得太重，使劲太大，结果，把纱捻开之后，又反捻紧了。使用许师傅“轻”的经验的结果，我捻出了绒度，心里有着说不出来的高兴。过去，嘴里常说，要向群众学习。这回，我实实在在地尝到了向群众学习的甜头。
    第一个毛病克服后，我又发现了第二个毛病。即使把断头捻出了绒度，有时还是要接下大圪?。这是什么原因呢？我又在同志们中间找经验，结果，又找到了：李桂英师傅从右向左平送断头的时候，非常稳，让断头和须条自然捻合在一起。李师傅稳的经验，一下子又把我点明了：原来，自己送得太猛；猛了，容易把流动着的须条猛然堵住，叫它堆成了个圆圪?。
    群众的经验，就象是登上先进水平的梯子一样，只要你一个经验一个经验认真地去学习它，就会使你一步一步地往上走，提高自己认识客观规律的能力和驾驭客观规律的本领。
        总结了群众的经验，还要从自己的实践
    中考证这些经验，吸取用得着的东西，拒绝
    用不着的东西，增加自己所特有的东西
    毛主席在《中国革命战争的战略问题》里，在谈到要学习别人的战争经验的时候说：“这些过去的战争所留给我们的血的教训，应该着重地学习它。这是一件事。然而还有一件事，即是从自己经验中考证这些结论，吸收那些用得着的东西，拒绝那些用不着的东西，增加那些自己所特有的东西。”在毛主席这个教导的鼓舞下，我在学习和总结群众经验的同时，大着胆子进行了试验，加进了自己所特有的东西。
    我在使用“单手解捻、从右向左平送”接头法的过程中，当着我用许淑嫒师傅的“轻”来克服我的“重”、用李桂英师傅的“稳”来克服了我的“猛”之后，接头质量由百分之六十提高到了百分之八十五，即接一百根头，保证了八十五根没圪?。但是，这个已经达到的质量标准，并不能使我满意。因为，车间的指标是百分之九十，我还没有达到；离我自己的指标，即接头无白点（圪?），更差得远。
    当时，在车间里，只有个别人偶尔一两次达到车间要求的指标。面对着这个事实，我怀疑是接头法本身有问题。
    就在这个时候，从外地传来了一种“单手崩头、从右向左上方送”接头法。我把这种新的接头法与原来的“单手解捻、从右向左平送”接头法作了比较。从比较中，我发现这种新方法的第一个优点是，不解捻就直接接崩头，减少了一道手续，节省了时间；第二个优点是，崩头垂直，便于接头时定位。
    在实践过程中，我又发现这种新的接头法，有三个弱点：第一，向上送纱头时，要求纱头与须条相隔一根纱的距离，这一根纱的距离不好掌握；第二，向左上方送的角度小，容易变成平送，回到头一种接头法的缺点上；第三，送上去，送多高，送到什么位置，不好掌握，弄不好，纱头要碰住须条，一碰就是一个圪?。
    在这两种接头法都有优点、也都有各自的缺点的情况下，我一心想要摸索出一种比较好的、能够保证接头质量的接头法出来。
      “练兵”当中，我开始在送纱的方向上进行试验，每次试验，从右送、左送、平送、正送这四个方向顺次进行，一个方向接十根头。对每一个方向的每一个接头，进行仔细的观察。
    从观察中，我发现用前三种方向接下的头，圪?较多，即使没有圪?的，也能清楚地看出纱与纱之间的接口。只有用正送这个方向接下头出奇：要有圪?，就是大圪?，没有圪?的，连纱与纱之间的接口也看不出来。经过许多次的反复试验，都是这样一个结果。于是，我对正送发生了兴趣，把精力集中到了正送上头。
    每次“练兵”，我都连着从正送这个方向接许多头。接好后，把有圪?的都解捻开，进行解剖分析。这么一解剖，在有圪?的接头里，发现了两种情况：一种，圪?出在接头的上端，很明显，这是由于纱头送得太低，往上一碰，把须条碰折回来以后形成的；另一种，圪?是在接头的下端，也很明显，这是由于送纱太猛，把纱头碰折回来以后形成的。
    我想，要是不使须条折回去，也不叫纱头折回来，不就可以完全保证接头质量了吗！果然，解剖开看不见接口的接头来一看，证实了自己的判断。这样，在我的心目中，肯定了从正送这个方向接头的方法。
    但是，要使用它，得解决前面说的那两个问题，即既不使须条碰回去，也不让纱头折回来。
    不使须条碰回去，这就要求纱头不要送得太低。怎么才能把纱头送到合适的位置上呢？我吸取了外地传来的接头法里定位在罗拉中上部这一个保证位置准确的单项动作，解决了纱头位置不准的问题。
    不让纱头折回来，这就要求送纱头时不要太猛。我吸取了原来使用的接头法里，接头时稳稳平送这一个单项动作，克服了猛的毛病。
    在吸取新旧两种接头法优点的基础上，我总结出了另一种接头法——“对准须条正送”接头法。
    这种接头法出现后，我又吸取了落纱能手史玉珍轻放纱头的优点，并且作了发展，总结出“对准须条正送向上轻扶”接头法。跟着，我又吸取了张利香师傅崩头垂直的优点，并且作了发展，把她的崩头长改成了崩头短。
    使用这种接头法的结果，接头质量达到了百分之九十五。
        新接头法总结出来之后，还要不断从群
    众的实践和自己的实践中去检验它、丰富它
      “对准须条正送向上轻扶”接头法出现后，领导上很重视。很快就在全省各纺织厂传开了。晋华纺织厂的同志们要我去表演，表演之后，我发现檀英梅师傅在接头时，崩头、绕虾米螺丝同时动作，速度很快。而我自己绕完虾米螺丝之后，提起线来才崩头，浪费了时间。表演回来后，我就把这一经验，加进自己的接头法里，使每分钟的接头数由十四根上升到十七根。
    全省纺织业的劳动模范来我们厂表演时，我又发现晋生纺织厂弓彩变师傅是斜拿纱管。纱管的下端正对纱锭，所以插管时很准、很快。而我自己却是直拿纱管，纱管下端不正对纱锭，插管时不准、也不快。于是，我又把弓师傅的斜拿纱管动作，加进了自己的接头法里。接头的速度又由每分钟十七根上升到了十九根。
    从“单手解捻、从右向左平送”接头法开始，到
  “单手崩头、从右向左上方送”接头法，再到“对准须条正送向上轻扶”接头法，一直到现在进一步丰富为“对准须条轻扶”接头法，这就是我摸索接头规律的过程。今天，这个过程还没有完结，因为，我才实现了“接头基本无白点”，而还没有使接头无白点的主观愿望完全变成客观现实。
