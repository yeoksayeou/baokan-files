    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 15th - The First Asian-African-Latin American People's Solidarity Conference plenary session adopted a general declaration on January 15th. The full text is as follows:

    The First Asian-African-Latin American People's Solidarity Conference was held in Havana, the capital of the Republic of Cuba, from January 3rd to 15th, 1966. It has accomplished a task of profound significance. For the first time in history, a highly extensive representation of revolutionary forces from 82 countries across the three continents exchanged experiences and initiatives, strengthened the bonds of revolutionary and anti-imperialist unity, adopted fundamental resolutions against the imperialist and neo-colonialist systems of oppression and exploitation, and declared a death struggle against this system. The discussions held at the conference revealed that imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, and neo-colonialism are pursuing a policy of a series of interventions and military aggressions against countries of the three continents.

    Imperialism will never voluntarily abandon its policies of exploitation, oppression, plunder, aggression, and interference. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, through their own experiences, understand that U.S. imperialism, the irreconcilable enemy of the world's people, is the main bastion of colonial oppression and international reactionaries. Overthrowing the rule of U.S. imperialism is the decisive issue for achieving complete and final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle of the three continents, and the efforts of the peoples of the three continents should converge on this goal.

    The conference was held at a time when the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as other regions of the world, are waging fierce struggles against all forms of domination by imperialism and neo-colonialism, headed by U.S. imperialism. The world situation is favorable to the development of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples. The upsurge of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is an event of paramount importance and great significance. The discussions at the conference vividly revealed the realities of imperialism and neo-colonialism. Comparing the benefits, profits, and wealth enjoyed by imperialist monopoly groups with the impoverished living conditions of the peoples of the three continents reveals the acuteness of one of the greatest contradictions of our time, the contradiction between imperialism and the oppressed nations and peoples. U.S. imperialism is the main pillar of oppression; it leads, supports, and maintains the world system of oppression and exploitation.

    This overall situation dictates that imperialist and neo-colonialist powers economically dominate the enslaved countries, systematically plunder our peoples, and force us to act as tribute payers to the coffers of monopoly groups.

    Monopoly groups of the imperialist powers plunder the enormous wealth of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for their own benefit. For centuries, they have plundered in a myriad of ways. They have seized natural resources above ground, underground, and in the oceans, controlled the most important sectors of industry and public utilities through investment, controlled foreign trade, imposed conditions detrimental to international trade relations, and subjected national banks and finance to their domination.

    The average annual income per capita in the oppressed and exploited countries of the three continents is unimaginably lower compared to the powers that oppress and exploit. The astronomical profits of monopoly groups stand in stark contrast to extremely high infant mortality rates, illiteracy rates, the near-total absence of schools, medical services, and hospitals, in short, to the poverty, unemployment, hunger, and suffering of our peoples. This injustice is even more pronounced when considering the hopeful future that the current development of science, technology, and culture promises to humanity, contrasted with the heartbreaking reality that the oppressed and exploited masses of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are deprived of all possibilities of enjoying the enormous material and spiritual wealth accumulated by human wisdom and labor over centuries. Our peoples cannot utilize the advances made in science and technology because the system of oppression and exploitation deprives them of the opportunity. They have consistently been at a disadvantage, leading to an ever-widening gap in living standards between victims and perpetrators. It is abundantly clear that the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America cannot reach this higher level of material and spiritual life under their current social and economic structures, and the despairing plight of poverty, hunger, and ignorance among the oppressed and exploited masses of the three continents is also very clear. These are the reasons that relentlessly condemn the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and neo-colonialism.

    In order to shore up the system headed by it against the impact of the people, U.S. imperialism maintains and promotes international tensions, threatening peace and security; establishes aggressive military bases around the globe; concludes military treaties that blatantly violate the principles of national sovereignty; shamelessly proclaims the so-called right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and to occupy all or part of the territories of other countries by force, thus acting as a shameful gendarme without borders; provides money and weapons so that declining colonialist countries can retain their spoils and share the benefits with them; shamelessly and arrogantly insists on imposing its own ideology on others, using its worldwide communications and propaganda network for this purpose; strives to infiltrate its decadent cultural manifestations into all peoples, tampering with history, fabricating facts, and using slander as a weapon of struggle; imposes economic blockades, vainly attempting to encircle these peoples with hunger to make them submit, and insists on extending this evil disruptive policy to the trade policies of its allies due to its own impotence; conducts conspiracies worldwide to foster and maintain anti-people and anti-national regimes that serve as pillars of the system of oppression and exploitation; invests worldwide, reaping millions of dollars annually for its monopoly groups; commits all kinds of hateful crimes against the peoples of various countries and actively prepares to attack socialist countries and world peace.

    Imperialism and neo-colonialism, by their very nature of oppression and exploitation, do everything possible to oppose the independence, sovereignty, national and social liberation of the peoples of all countries. The oppressed peoples of the world fight against them for the principles of self-determination, national sovereignty, and national independence. The liberation movements of the three continents have become one of the most important forces in the worldwide struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, playing a decisive role in human history together with the peoples of socialist countries and the international proletariat. Imperialists are increasingly isolated and weakened. The crisis of their system is intensifying.

    The interests of national liberation are closely related to the needs of social revolution. The national liberation movement, the peasants' demands for land, the struggles of the working class to achieve huge social and political demands, the resolute actions of youth and students, the demands of intellectuals and other strata of the people to recover trampled and destroyed rights, the struggle against the oligarchy and military dictatorships that serve the ruling class, the battle against racial discrimination and other social inequalities—all this constitutes a surging torrent that forms a movement destined to play a major role in human progress. The peoples of countries that have eliminated the phenomenon of human exploitation of man and have established socialism provide valuable impetus to the struggles of the peoples of countries suffering from imperialist oppression through their own examples and assistance.

    With the development of the liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the working class and progressive strata in capitalist countries can assist this movement more effectively and directly. The civil protest movement launched by the American people due to the war waged by the American government against the Vietnamese people clearly proves this point.

    The effective revolutionary actions of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the heroic resistance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam help to raise the level of struggle and consciousness of the American people, who are expressing their anti-war sentiment more powerfully and intensely. This shows that the liberation of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will accelerate the struggle of the working class and other oppressed strata of the people in the United States and developed capitalist countries of Europe against the rule of monopoly capital, against oppression and exploitation, and for social progress. At the same time, the development of this class struggle of the proletariat and all working people in capitalist countries will help the development of the national liberation struggle in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In this way, joint efforts will defeat the common enemy of the peoples of all countries: imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, which is the most ferocious and conducts the greatest oppression. A number of countries on the three continents have already won political independence, while many other countries are fighting for independence. Those who have already gained independence and those who are fighting for independence today strengthened their alliance at the Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference. They studied how to fulfill the international obligations they owe to the common cause of the peoples of all countries, which is to eliminate the oppression and exploitation system of neo-colonialism and imperialism.

    There still exist areas enslaved by the most brutal forms of the colonial system, and many representatives from the peoples of these countries participated in this conference. In order to solve the serious problems that have emerged in the struggle for social and economic development and for complete liberation in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, it is necessary to hold high the principles of national self-determination, national sovereignty, and political independence.

    The conference declares that all peoples have the inalienable right to achieve complete political independence and to adopt all forms of struggle necessary to win this right, including armed struggle. There is no more important task for the enslaved peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    Those Asian, African, and Latin American countries that have already gained political independence are aware that, in order to win complete liberation, a formal legal status of sovereignty is not enough. In order to achieve complete liberation, it is necessary to eliminate all instruments of imperialist oppression and exploitation, to carry out profound reforms of the socio-economic structure, and to establish the material and technical basis for building a society of free people. With political liberation, economic liberation must also be added. Only in this way can social equality between people and genuine national independence be guaranteed. The peoples of independent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America should oppose all forms of imperialist infiltration, subversion, exploitation, and plunder, maximize their initiative and exploit their resources, strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation with friendly countries, eliminate imperialist and colonialist forces, oppose neo-colonialist aggression and infiltration, and establish and promote national economies and cultures.

    The conference declares that, in order to eliminate all traces of imperialist economic domination and build their own economies, the common principles of the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the programs of the peoples still striving for liberation are to obtain the following rights: national control of basic resources, nationalization of banks and important enterprises, state control of foreign trade and exchange, strengthening of the state-owned sector, reconsideration and rejection of anti-national fake debts imposed on their economies, implementation of genuine land policies to abolish feudal and semi-feudal ownership, promotion of the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, improvement of the living standards of peasants and other agricultural laborers, and promotion of the growth of the national economy and exports.

    The implementation of these principles can enable the full development of the natural resources of these countries, and industrialization can be implemented according to the conditions of each country, thereby achieving economic liberation.

    Imperialism is trying its best to strangle countries that have already gained independence. It creates obstacles in the trade of these countries, uses monopoly control over transportation, carries out evil blockades, and destroys the economies of these countries by forcibly lowering the prices of primary products and making these prices fluctuate frequently.

    The conference declares that the liberated peoples have the right to trade with other countries in the world on an equal footing; the phenomenon of frequent fluctuations in the prices of basic products must be ended, and these prices must be determined fairly, so that these prices and the prices of industrial products maintain a reasonable relationship; the peoples of the three continents urgently need to carry out a joint struggle with the cooperation of progressive forces in the rest of the world to smash the imperialist blockade of liberated countries in trade and transportation.

    The rule of imperialism and neo-colonialism has left the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America with a legacy of technological backwardness, which hinders urban and rural workers from improving labor productivity by adopting advanced technologies in industry and agriculture. The efforts of urban and rural workers are the foundation of national progress.

    The conference declares that all peoples have the right to learn technology, and liberated countries must cultivate a large number of technical cadres from among their own people. This requires an educational revolution that starts with the elimination of illiteracy and leads to a technological revolution.

    Countries liberated from imperialist rule are facing the most shocking lack of health systems, with neither hospitals, auxiliary health stations, nor professional personnel to expand these institutions.

    The conference declares that the peoples of the three continents have the right to enjoy healthy living, medical care, and appropriate preventive measures. Liberated countries need to accept all possible assistance from the more developed countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in order to organize medical service systems and medical personnel. It is necessary to place special emphasis on cultivating specialized and auxiliary cadres, who should massively carry out this mass task under the planned leadership of the state and with the widest participation of the people.

    Imperialists and neo-colonialists maintain racial discrimination in major regions around the world, and have reached the most detestable, barbaric, and insidious level in apartheid policies, suppressing and opposing the people of South Africa and threatening the people of Zimbabwe, keeping them in a state of permanent enslavement. Racial discrimination is a tool of oppression and exploitation and is also the most unreasonable and barbaric form of inequality.

    The conference declares that all people are completely equal, and the peoples of all countries have an obligation to conduct struggles against all manifestations of racism and discrimination. Therefore, it expresses absolute support for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe against the Smith racist government and the international solidarity movement against the South African government, and calls on all countries attending this conference to impose political and trade blockades on South Africa, while boycotting the transportation of oil and weapons.

    Military treaties, the existence of military bases, and the stationing of imperialist troops or mercenaries in the lands of other countries constitute a violation of national sovereignty and a threat to peaceful coexistence between countries. "Imperialism maintains this situation in order to undermine national liberation movements, intimidate neighboring countries, and invade newly liberated countries."

    The conference declares that all peoples have the right to eliminate foreign military bases, and calls for strengthening the struggle to achieve this goal, opposing military treaties and opposing the entry of imperialist troops or mercenaries.

    The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are fighting to defeat their own reactionary classes who are subservient to foreign interests and help maintain the neo-colonial system of oppression and exploitation. In this struggle, the reactionary classes put up fierce resistance and will not easily allow others to seize the power they use to exploit and oppress the people. The revolutionary patriotic struggle of the people of each country is a contribution to the liberation of other countries.

    The conference declares that all peoples have the right to achieve their own political, economic, and cultural liberation through the roads they deem necessary to achieve this goal, including armed struggle.

    Imperialism and the reactionary classes in various countries oppose the liberation movements of the peoples of various countries with all the military, political, and false judicial means at their disposal. They violate international agreements, attempt to fabricate various false reasons to cover up their crimes, undermine the principles of self-determination and national sovereignty, and undermine the right of the peoples of various countries to implement revolutionary changes in their economic and social structures. In order to do evil, they commit various crimes and atrocities: subversion, infiltrating spies and conducting sabotage, introducing criminals and conducting direct aggression to stifle the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of various countries; they use violence and their armed forces to achieve the goals they intend to achieve.

    The conference declares that all peoples have the right to oppose imperialist violence with revolutionary violence in order to protect sovereignty and national independence in this situation.

    The struggles carried out by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in this regard are a decisive contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle of the three continents and an effective contribution to the liberation of the peoples of the three continents and the consolidation of world peace. Every victory of the people inspires people to seize new victories.

    The conference declares that the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as progressive countries and governments around the world, have the right and the obligation to provide material and moral support to the peoples who are fighting for their own liberation or who have been directly or indirectly invaded by imperialist powers.

    American troops are currently occupying the territory of the Dominican Republic. Imperialism, against the will of the Dominican people, interfered in the people's revolution in that country in order to support its puppets. It violates national sovereignty, tramples on the principle of non-interference, and kills not only the soldiers of that country but also women and children.

    Therefore, the conference declares that the Dominican people have the right to strike against the American occupation forces with all methods at their disposal, mainly with revolutionary people's war, and have the right to demand the support of all peoples and governments around the world.

    The heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people against the imperialist aggressors is not only justly defending the independence of this country, but also defending the right to self-determination and sovereignty of the peoples of all countries around the world.

    The conference strongly condemns the aggressive war of the American imperialists in South Vietnam and its bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and judges them to be war criminals because of their barbaric actions against the Vietnamese people. The conference exposes the deceptive peace statements of the Johnson administration and unreservedly supports the claims made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front for the resolution of the Vietnam issue. The conference declares that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam and

    亚非拉人民团结会议全体会议通过总宣言
    美帝国主义是世界人民不共戴天敌人
    三洲人民加强解放斗争推翻美帝统治
    各国人民有权以革命的暴力反对帝国主义的暴力
    新华社哈瓦那十五日电　第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议全体会议十五日通过了总宣言，全文如下：
    一九六六年一月三日至十五日，在古巴共和国首都哈瓦那举行了第一届亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议。它所完成的任务是有崇高意义的。历史上第一次三大洲八十二国革命力量的极为广泛的代表交流了经验和创议，加强了革命和反帝团结的纽带，通过了反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义压迫和剥削制度的基本的决议，宣布向这个制度进行殊死的斗争。会议进行的讨论表明，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义推行对三大洲各国进行一系列干涉和军事侵略的政策。
    帝国主义决不会自动放弃它的剥削、压迫、掠夺、侵略和干涉政策。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民由于切身经验懂得了全世界人民不共戴天的敌人——美帝国主义是殖民压迫和国际反动派的主要堡垒。推翻美帝国主义的统治是使三大洲反帝斗争取得完全和最终胜利的决定性的问题，三大洲人民的努力应该汇集到这一目标中去。
    会议是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲以及世界其它地区人民展开反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义一切形式的统治的激烈斗争时举行的。世界局势有利于被压迫人民反帝革命斗争的发展。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动的高涨是非常重要和具有巨大意义的事件。会议的讨论生动地揭示了帝国主义和新老殖民主义的现实状况。把帝国主义垄断集团享有的好处、利润和财富同三大洲人民贫困的生活条件比较一下，就可看到我们时代最大矛盾之一的尖锐程度，这个矛盾就是帝国主义与被压迫民族和人民之间的矛盾。美帝国主义是压迫的主要支柱；它领导、豢养和维持世界压迫和剥削制度。
    这个总的形势决定：帝国主义和新老殖民强国对被奴役的国家进行经济统治，对我们各国人民进行系统的掠夺，迫使我们充当垄断集团钱库的纳贡者。
    帝国主义列强的垄断集团为了自己的利益掠夺亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的巨大财富。几个世纪以来，它们进行掠夺的形式是极为五花八门的。它们霸占了地上、地下和海洋的自然资源，通过投资控制了工业和公用事业的最重要的部门，把持对外贸易和强加有害于国际贸易关系的条件，把各国银行和金融置于它们的支配之下。
      三大洲被压迫和剥削国家的每人每年平均收入和进行压迫和剥削的强国相比低得难以想象。垄断集团以天文数字计算的利润同极高的儿童死亡率、文盲比例、几乎完全没有学校、医疗事业和医院，总之同我们各国人民的贫困、失业、饥饿和苦难的情况适成对照。在现在的科学、技术和文化的发展向人类所预示的有希望的未来同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫和剥削群众被剥夺了享有多少世纪以来人类智慧和劳动积累的巨大物质和精神财富的一切可能性这种令人痛心的现实形成了巨大的对照，如果考虑到这一点，这种非正义现象就更加突出。我们各国人民不能利用科学和技术所取得的进展，因为压迫和剥削制度剥夺了他们的机会，他们一贯处于不利地位，这使受害者和害人者的生活水平日益悬殊。十分清楚的是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民在他们目前所处的社会和经济结构下，不可能达到这种较高的物质和精神生活水平，三大洲被压迫和被剥削群众的贫困、饥饿和愚昧的令人绝望的处境也是非常清楚的。这些理由就是以使人无情地谴责帝国主义和新老殖民主义的压迫和剥削了。
    美帝国主义为了在人民的冲击下支撑住以它为首的这个制度，维持和促进国际紧张局势，威胁和平和安全；围绕全球建立起侵略性的军事基地；订立公然破坏国家主权原则的军事条约；空前无耻地宣布所谓有权干涉他国内政和用武力占领其他国家的全部或一部分领土，从而充当了没有国界的宪兵的可耻角色；出钱、出武器来使没落中殖民主义国家可以保持它们的猎获物和同它们分享好处；厚颜无耻和盛气凌人地坚持把自己的意识形态强加于人，为此目的利用了遍及世界的传播和宣传网；力求使它的没落的文化表现形式渗透到所有人民中去，篡改历史，假造事实，利用诬蔑作为斗争武器；进行经济封锁，徒劳地企图用饥饿包围这些人民来使他们屈服并由于自己无能为力而坚持要把这种罪恶的捣乱政策扩大到同盟者的贸易政策中去；在世界范围内进行阴谋活动来扶植和维持充当压迫和剥削制度支柱的反人民、反民族政权；在全世界投资，每年为它的垄断集团取得数以百万计的美元；对各国人民犯下各种可恨的罪行并积极准备进攻社会主义国家和世界和平。
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义出于压迫和剥削制度的本性而竭尽全力反对各国人民的独立、主权、民族和社会解放。全世界被压迫人民反对它们，为自决、国家主权和民族独立的原则而斗争。三大洲人民的解放运动成了全世界反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的最重要力量之一，同社会主义国家人民和国际无产阶级一起在人类历史中起着决定性的作用。帝国主义者日益孤立和受到削弱。他们的制度的危机日益加剧。
    民族解放的利益同社会革命的需要是密切相关的。民族解放运动、农民的土地要求、工人阶级为了实现巨大的社会和政治要求而进行的斗争、青年和学生的坚决行动、脑力劳动者和其他阶层人民收回受到践踏和破坏的权利的要求、反对寡头势力和为统治阶级效劳的军事独裁政权的斗争、反对种族歧视和其他社会不平等现象的战斗，这一切构成了汹涌澎湃的洪流，形成注定要在人类进步中起重大作用的运动。已经消灭了人剥削人现象并已建立起社会主义的各国人民通过自己的榜样和援助给遭受帝国主义压迫的各国人民的斗争以宝贵的推动力。
    随着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民解放运动的发展，资本主义国家的工人阶级和进步阶层可以更有效、更直接地援助这个运动，美国人民由于美国政府对越南人民进行的战争而展开的公民抗议运动就明确地证明了这一点。
    越南南方民族解放阵线有效的革命行动和越南民主共和国的英勇抗击有助于提高美国人民的斗争和觉悟水平，美国人民越来越有力和强烈地表现出他们的反战情绪。这就表明了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的解放将加速美国和欧洲发达资本主义国家工人阶级和其他被压迫阶层人民为反对垄断资本统治、反对压迫和剥削、争取社会进步的斗争。同时，资本主义国家的无产阶级和一切劳动人民的这种阶级斗争的发展将有助于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族解放斗争的发展，这样，共同努力将战胜各国人民的共同敌人：帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，它是最凶恶和进行最大压迫的帝国主义。三大洲有一批国家已经赢得了政治上的独立，而另外许多国家正在为争取独立而战斗。那些已经获得独立和正在争取独立的国家今天在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民团结会上加强了它们的联盟，它们研究了如何完成对各国人民共同事业所负的国际义务，这个事业就是消灭新老殖民主义和帝国主义的压迫和剥削制度。
    现在还存在着遭受殖民制度中最残酷的形式奴役的地区，这些国家人民中有许多派代表参加了这次会议。为了解决亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国在争取社会和经济发展、争取彻底解放中出现的严重问题，必须高举国家自决、国家主权和政治独立的原则。
    会议宣布，各国人民有不可让与的权利实现政治上的完全独立和采取赢得这个权利所必要的一切斗争形式，其中包括武装斗争。对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被奴役的人民来说，没有比这更重要的任务了。
    那些在政治上已经获得独立的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家觉悟到，为了赢得完全解放，仅仅有一个形式上的主权法律地位是不够的。为了取得完全解放，必须清除帝国主义压迫和剥削的一切工具，对社会经济结构进行深刻的改革，建立起建设一个自由人的社会的物质和技术基础。有了政治解放，还必须加上经济解放。只有这样才能保证人与人的社会平等和真正的国家独立。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲独立国家的人民应该反对帝国主义一切形式的渗透、颠覆、剥削和掠夺，最大限度地发展它们的首创精神和发掘它们的资源，加强同友好国家的互相帮助和合作，清除帝国主义和殖民主义势力，反对新殖民主义的侵略和渗透、建立和促进民族经济和文化。
    会议宣布，为了消除帝国主义经济统治的一切痕迹和建设自己的经济，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民斗争的共同原则和还在争取解放的人民的纲领是取得下列权利：由本国控制基本资源，实行银行和重要的企业国有化，由国家控制对外贸易和兑换，壮大国营部门，重新考虑和否认强加于它们经济的反民族的假债务，实行真正的土地政策，以取消封建和半封建所有制，促进农牧业的发展，提高农民和其他农业劳动者的生活水平，促进国民经济和出口的增长。
    实行这些原则就可以使这些国家的自然资源得到充分开发，并根据每个国家的条件实行工业化，从而实现经济解放。
    帝国主义竭力企图扼杀已经获得独立的国家，它在这些国家的贸易中制造障碍，利用对运输的垄断性控制，进行罪恶的封锁，通过强行压低初级产品价格和使这些价格经常波动来摧毁这些国家的经济。
    会议宣布，解放了的各国人民有权在平等的基础上同世界其他国家进行贸易；必须结束基本产品价格经常波动的现象，公平地确定这些产品的价格，使这些产品的价格和工业品价格保持合理关系；三大洲各国人民迫切需要在世界其余地区进步力量的合作下进行共同斗争来粉碎帝国主义在贸易和运输方面对已经解放了的国家的封锁。
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义的统治给亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民留下了技术落后的烂摊子，这就阻碍城乡劳动者通过在工农业中采用先进的工艺提高劳动生产率，而城乡劳动者的努力正是国家进步的基础。
    会议宣布各国人民有学习技术的权利，已解放的国家必须大批培养来自本国人民中间的技术干部，这要求进行从消灭文盲开始并导致技术革命的教育革命。
    从帝国主义的统治下解放出来的国家正处于卫生系统最令人吃惊的缺乏的情况下，既没有医院，也没有辅助性的卫生所，也没有专业人员去扩大这些机构。
    会议宣布三大洲各国人民有权享受健康的生活、医疗以及适当的预防措施，解放了的国家有必要接受亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲比较发达的国家一切可能的援助，以便组织医疗服务系统以及医疗人员，有必要特别强调培养专职和辅助干部，他们应当在国家有计划的领导下和人民的最广泛参与下大量地执行这项群众性的任务。
    帝国主义者和新老殖民主义者在全世界主要的地区保持着种族歧视，并且在种族隔离政策方面达到了最可憎、最野蛮和最阴险的地步，镇压和反对南非人民，威胁津巴布韦人民，使他们保持永久被奴役的地位。种族歧视是一种压迫和剥削的工具，而且是一种最不合理和最野蛮的不平等形式。
      会议宣布所有的人完全平等，各国人民有义务进行反对种族主义和歧视的一切表现的斗争，因此，表示绝对支持津巴布韦人民反对史密斯种族主义政府的斗争和反对南非政府的国际声援运动，并且号召出席这次会议的所有国家对南非进行政治和贸易封锁，同时抵制运送石油和武器。
      军事条约、军事基地的存在以及向别国土地驻扎帝国主义的军队或雇佣军构成了对民族主权的侵犯和对各国之间和平共处的威胁。“帝国主义维持着这一局面，以便破坏民族解放运动，恐吓邻国和侵
  略刚刚解放的国家。”
    会议宣布各国人民有消除外国军事基地的权利，并呼吁加强斗争来达到这个目标，反对军事条约和反对进驻帝国主义军队或雇佣军。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民为战胜屈从外国利益、帮助维持新殖民主义的压迫和剥削制度的本国反动阶级而斗争。在这场斗争中，反动阶级进行凶猛的抵抗，不会让别人轻而易举地夺取他们用来剥削和压迫人民的政权。每个国家人民的革命爱国斗争是对其他国家解放的贡献。
    会议宣布各国人民有权通过他们认为达到这个目的所必要的道路，包括武装斗争在内，来取得自己的政治、经济和文化解放。
    帝国主义和各国反动阶级用它们力所能及的各种军事、政治和虚假的司法手段来反对各国人民的解放运动。它们违背国际协定，企图捏造各种虚假的理由来掩饰它们的罪行，破坏自决原则和国家主权，破坏各国人民在自己的经济和社会结构中实行革命变革的权利。它们为了做坏事，犯下了各种罪行和暴行：颠覆，打入间谍和进行破坏的特务，引进犯罪分子和进行直接侵略来窒息各国人民的正当愿望；它们使用暴力和它们的武装部队来实现它们所打算达到的目的。
    会议宣布各国人民有权以革命的暴力反对帝国主义的暴力，以便在这种情况下保护主权和民族独立。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民在这方面坚持进行的斗争是对三大洲的反帝斗争的一个决定性贡献，是对三大洲人民的解放和巩固世界和平的有效贡献。人民的每一个胜利都鼓舞人们去夺取新的胜利。
    会议宣布亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民以及全世界的进步国家和政府有权和有义务向为自己解放而斗争的人民、或遭到帝国主义列强直接或间接侵略的人民提供物质上和道义上的支持。
    美国军队目前占领着多米尼加共和国的领土。帝国主义违背多米尼加人民的意愿，干涉该国的人民革命，以便扶植它的傀儡，它侵犯国家主权，践踏不干涉原则，不仅杀害这个国家的战士，而且杀害妇女和儿童。
    因此，会议宣布多米尼加人民有权用他们力所能及的各种方法、主要用革命的人民战争来打击美国占领军并有权要求全世界所有人民和政府的支持。
