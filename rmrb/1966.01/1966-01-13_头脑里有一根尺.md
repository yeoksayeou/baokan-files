    "A Ruler in the Mind"
    Zhu Desheng
    On Sunday, I went to the street to have cotton clothes made and visited three clothing stores in a row, asking three tailors to take my measurements. The first one didn't use a ruler, but just glanced at me casually and asked me to buy nine and a half *chi* of cloth. The second one measured roughly with a ruler and said I needed nine *chi* of cloth. The third one carefully measured my size and repeatedly calculated with an abacus, telling me that eight and seven-tenths *chi* of cloth would be enough.
    To make the same cotton garment, the three tailors measured different sizes. I asked the third tailor, "The others want nine and a half *chi* of cloth, why do you only need eight and seven-tenths *chi*?" He replied with a smile, "I have no secret, it's all about serving the people! You have to carefully calculate for the customer. If we in this profession think of measuring a little looser, we'll use a few more *cun* of cloth. If we think of measuring a little tighter, we can save a few *cun* of cloth." After hearing his words, I suddenly understood that this tailor had a "ruler" in his mind. This "ruler" is "serving the people" and "carefully calculating for the customer."
    I estimated that between "loose" and "tight" in making a cotton garment, we could save eight *cun* of cloth. If we made thousands upon thousands of cotton garments, even considering the clothing problem of the nation's 650 million people, wouldn't that save tens of millions of *zhang* of cloth? Between these two words "loose" and "tight," there is indeed a great deal to calculate and a great deal to be done! From this, I think that if everyone in the country, engaged in all walks of life, consciously had a standard of "serving the people" and "working for the revolution" in their minds, and could find the gap between "loose" and "tight," how much potential could be tapped! For example, if a train stoker were "tighter" when throwing coal, the country would save a few shovels of coal. If a car driver used fuel more "tightly," the country would save a few *jin* of oil. If a machine worker used materials more "tightly," the country would save a few *cun* of steel... If we "gather every drop to make a stream" and "accumulate many a little to make a mickle," wouldn't we save a lot of wealth for the country!

    “头脑里有一根尺”
    朱德生
    星期天，上街做棉衣，一连跑了三家服装店，先后请三位裁缝师傅量尺码。第一位没用尺量，眼睛随便地打量了一下，要我买九尺五寸布；第二位用尺大致量了量，说要九尺布；第三位认真地量了尺码，用算盘反复地算了算，告诉我买八尺七寸布就够了。
    同样做一件棉衣，三个裁缝师傅量出了不同的尺码。我问第三位裁缝师傅：“别人要九尺五寸布，为什么你只要八尺七寸布就够了？”他笑着回答：“我没有什么秘诀，为人民服务嘛！就得为顾客精打细算，干我们这一行的，脑子里稍想着量松一点，就得多用几寸布，脑子里想着量紧一点，就能省出几寸布来”。听了他的话，我恍然大悟，原来这位裁缝师傅脑子里有一根“尺”，这根“尺”就是“为人民服务”、“为顾客精打细算”。
    我估算了一下，做一件棉衣在“松”与“紧”之间，就能省下八寸布，要是做成千上万件棉衣，以至从全国六亿五千万人民的穿衣问题来考虑，这不就能省下几千万丈布来吗？在这“松”与“紧”两个字之间，真是大可算账，大有可为哩！由此我联想到，如果全国从事各行各业的每一个人，脑子里都自觉地有一根“为人民服务”、“为革命而工作”的标尺，都能在“松”与“紧”之间找一找差距，该能挖出多么大的潜力啊！譬如，火车司炉在投煤时把得“紧”一些，为国家省下几锹煤；汽车司机用油“紧”一些，为国家省下几斤油；机械工人用料“紧”一些，为国家省下几寸钢材……这样“滴水成流”、“集腋成裘”，不就能为国家节省大量的财富吗！
