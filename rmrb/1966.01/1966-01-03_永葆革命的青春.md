    Mao Zedong Thought is the ideological weapon for transforming the objective world, and also the ideological weapon for transforming the subjective world.

    Today, the *People's Daily* publishes Comrade Li Suwen's article, "Serving the People is Limitless." Through her own experience of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to transform her ideology, it vividly reveals that if proletarian thought and socialist thought do not occupy our minds, bourgeois thought will inevitably occupy them. This invisible ideological struggle is long-term, repetitive, sometimes ebbing and flowing, and at times even very intense.

    Comrade Mao Zedong always taught us:
      "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed";
      "The working class must constantly learn in their work, gradually overcome their shortcomings, and can never stop."

    Why did Comrade Mao Zedong emphasize ideological transformation so much?

    This is because in socialist society, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected in people's minds. As long as classes exist, the class struggle in ideology will not end.

    The concentrated expression of bourgeois thought—individualism—is a stubborn illness for every revolutionary, not easy to eradicate completely. Overcoming it in one period on one issue, it may relapse again in another situation on another issue.

    Comrade Li Suwen once experienced emotional fluctuations because she was not selected as a formal representative to the advanced producers' conference; she once experienced a fierce struggle in her mind between thinking of herself or thinking of the people when encountering difficulties; she also once made a mistake in her work, unknown to others, and faced the test of whether she had the courage to expose it when awarded first prize. All these things, some of which seem very small, demonstrate two opposing worldviews and the thoughts of two different classes waging a sharp battle in her mind. From this, Comrade Li Suwen draws the conclusion: Serving the people cannot tolerate even a trace of falsehood! However, individualism is always at work: we want to serve the people, but it makes people pursue personal things, reaching out to the Party and the people for honor, position, or something else. What a dangerous and invisible thought this is!

    In our ideological transformation process, eliminating selfish ideas of individualism is a serious class struggle, a struggle between two worldviews.

    Why did Comrade Mao Zedong also emphasize that ideological transformation can never stop?

    We shoulder the great task of transforming the objective world, including the natural world and human society. To transform the objective world, we must understand the objective world. The natural world is not stagnant, nor is human society stagnant; it is forever moving and developing. The history of the natural world and the history of human society will never end. Therefore, every person who is determined to make revolution and transform the objective world must constantly learn, transform, and improve their cognitive abilities in the process of practice. When an old contradiction is resolved, a new contradiction arises, and we must continue to learn through new practices to recognize and resolve it. Only in this way can we continue to move forward.

    Revolutionaries in the period of democratic revolution, if they no longer advance, their thinking will fall behind in the period of socialist revolution, and they will not revolt, even degenerate into the dregs of history.

    Bringing the selfish and self-interested ideas of the old society into socialist society makes it impossible to highly cherish state property and makes it impossible to be consciously practice economy and oppose waste.

    Doing work with a hired attitude of earning a living makes it impossible to establish a new attitude towards labor and to engage in selfless labor for the cause of socialist construction.

    That is why everyone must transform the entire society in the class struggle and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform themselves.

    The transformation of the objective world is endless, and the transformation of the subjective world is also endless, and can never stop. This is why one of the conditions for entering communism is that all the people greatly improve their communist ideological awareness and moral character. The new society must cultivate a new generation for itself.

    In our own minds, there are still non-proletarian thoughts to varying degrees. Our thinking will still be contaminated with dust and subject to the invasion of non-proletarian thoughts. Therefore, we must treat our own thoughts like we treat our own faces, washing them every day; like treating the dust in the room, sweeping it away every day. We must transform our own non-proletarian thoughts in constant and conscious ideological struggle, and resist the invasion of bourgeois thoughts.

    Comrade Mao Zedong often enlightens us with the principle of "flowing water does not rot, a door hinge does not become worm-eaten," asking us to constantly carry out self-transformation and resist the erosion of various microorganisms in our thinking.

    Everyone must transform themselves, and can never stop! This is the ideological weapon that Comrade Mao Zedong has given us.

    As long as we consciously grasp this ideological weapon, firmly establish and expand the position of Mao Zedong Thought in our own minds, and creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production,

    永葆革命的青春
    毛泽东思想是改造客观世界的思想武器，也是改造主观世界的思想武器。
    今天本报发表的李素文同志《为人民服务是无限的》这篇文章，以她自己活学活用毛泽东思想改造思想的经历，生动地揭示出我们的头脑这个阵地，无产阶级思想、社会主义思想如果不去占领，资产阶级思想必去占领。这一场看不见的思想斗争，是长期的，反复的，时起时伏的，有时甚至是很激烈的。
    毛泽东同志总是教导我们：
      “在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造”；
      “工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”
    毛泽东同志为什么这样强调思想改造呢？
    这是因为在社会主义社会里，无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争，必然会反映到人的思想里。阶级存在，意识形态里的阶级斗争也就不会完结。
    资产阶级思想的集中表现——个人主义，对于每一个革命者来说，是一种顽症，不易彻底根除。一个时期，一个问题上克服了，在另一种情况下，另一个问题上，它又可能再一次发作。
    李素文同志曾经由于没有当上先进生产者会议的正式代表而情绪波动；曾经在遇到困难的时候，思想中发生了为自己还是为人民的激烈斗争；也曾经在工作中出了差错，别人不知道，被评得一等奖的时候，受到自己有没有勇气加以揭露的考验。所有这些事情，有的看来虽然很小，但它表现了两种对立的世界观，两个不同阶级的思想，在她的头脑里进行着尖锐的争夺战。从这里，李素文同志得出一个结论：为人民服务掺不得一点假！可是，个人主义总在作祟：我们要为人民服务，它却使人们追求个人的东西，伸手向党向人民要荣誉，要地位，或者要别的什么。这是何等危险而又看不见的思想啊！
    在我们的思想改造过程中，排除个人主义的杂念，是一场严重的阶级斗争，一场两种世界观的斗争。
    毛泽东同志为什么又这样强调思想改造永远也不能停止呢？
    我们担负着改造客观世界，包括自然界和人类社会的伟大任务。要改造客观世界，就得认识客观世界。自然界不是停滞不前的，人类社会也不是停滞不前的，而是永远运动着和发展着的。自然界的历史，人类社会历史的发展，永远不会完结。因此，每一个立志革命，决心改造客观世界的人，就得在实践过程中，不断学习，改造和提高自己的认识能力。一个旧矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现了，又要通过新的实践继续学习，去认识它，解决它。只有如此，才能不断前进。
    民主革命时期的革命者，如果不再前进，到了社会主义革命时期，思想就会跟不上，不革命，甚至堕落成为历史的滓渣。
    把旧社会自私自利的观念带到社会主义社会里来，就不会高度爱护国家财产，就不可能有厉行节约、反对浪费的自觉性。
    带着挣钱吃饭的雇佣态度做工做事，就不可能建立新的劳动态度，为社会主义建设事业进行忘我劳动。
    这就是为什么人人都要在阶级斗争中，在向自然界的斗争中，改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。
    改造客观世界是无止境的，改造主观世界也是无止境的，永远不能停止。这就是为什么进入共产主义的条件之一，是全体人民极大地提高共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质。新社会要为自己培养出一代新人。
    我们自己头脑里，都还有不同程度的非无产阶级思想。我们的思想还会沾染灰尘，受到非无产阶级思想的侵袭。因此，对待我们自己的思想，也要象对待自己的脸一样，要天天洗；象对待房间里的灰尘一样，要天天打扫。我们要在不断的自觉的思想斗争中，改造自己的非无产阶级思想，并且抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭。
    毛泽东同志经常以“流水不腐，户枢不蠧”的道理启示我们，要求我们不断地进行自我改造，抵抗思想上的各种微生物的侵蚀。
    人人要改造，永远不能停止！这就是毛泽东同志给我们的思想上的一杆枪。
    我们只要自觉地掌握了这个思想武器，在我们自己的头脑里，牢牢地建立和扩大毛泽东思想的阵地，不断地在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动中，活学活用毛泽东思想，进行思想改造，那么，我们就能心红志坚，永葆革命的青春。
