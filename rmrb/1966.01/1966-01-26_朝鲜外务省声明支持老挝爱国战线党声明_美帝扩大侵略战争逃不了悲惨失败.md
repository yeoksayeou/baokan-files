    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 25th. The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) issued a statement on January 25th, strongly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism in attempting to expand its war of aggression in Laos.

    The statement pointed out that these conspiratorial activities of U.S. imperialism in Laos are part of its nefarious scheme to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina region and salvage its disastrous defeat in South Vietnam.

    The statement said that under the smokescreen of "peace," U.S. imperialism continues to send its aggressive troops to South Vietnam, attempting to further expand its war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. At the same time, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Thai and South Vietnamese puppet cliques, is carrying out aggression and blatant provocations against the Cambodian people. All this proves that the "peace offensive" clamored for by U.S. imperialism is entirely a deceptive tactic to expand the war. The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' attempt to expand the war of aggression in Laos is a serious challenge to the Lao people, the Indochinese people, and all Asian people, and a flagrant violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina and the 1962 Geneva Accords on Laos.

    The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people resolutely condemn the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for their conspiracy to expand the criminal war against the Lao people and the Indochinese people, and fully support the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on January 17, 1966.

    The statement said that the Lao people's struggle against the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is a just and patriotic struggle for freedom and national independence, and a struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people will, as always, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Lao people in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and will unswervingly support their just struggle.

    The statement emphasized that the Lao issue must be resolved on the basis of the five measures and four-point position clarified in the declaration of the Lao National Political Consultative Conference. If U.S. imperialism, in defiance of the strong protests of the Lao people and peace-loving people around the world, continues its war activities against the Lao people, it will inevitably be unable to escape a more irreparable and tragic defeat.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Korean people are confident that the heroic Lao people, who are receiving active support and solidarity from the people of the world, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, will surely achieve final victory in their struggle to crush the aggression and expansionist schemes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to achieve genuine peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity.

    朝鲜外务省声明支持老挝爱国战线党声明
    美帝扩大侵略战争逃不了悲惨失败
    新华社平壤二十五日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省二十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义企图扩大侵略老挝战争的罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义对老挝的这种阴谋活动，是它们企图把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那地区，挽救它在越南南方的惨败的罪恶阴谋活动的一环。
    声明说，美帝国主义在“和平”的烟幕背后，继续向越南南方增派它的侵略军队，企图进一步扩大反对越南人民的侵略战争。同时，美帝国主义还伙同泰国和南越傀儡集团，对柬埔寨人民进行侵略和明目张胆的挑衅活动。这一切都证明，美帝国主义所叫嚷的“和平攻势”，完全是扩大战争的欺骗手段。声明指出，美帝国主义企图扩大侵略老挝战争的行径，是对老挝人民、印度支那人民和全体亚洲人民的严重的挑战行为，是对一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议和一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的粗暴破坏。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义及其走狗扩大罪恶的战争来反对老挝人民和印度支那人民的阴谋活动，并且完全支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一九六六年一月十七日的声明。
    声明说，老挝人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗武装侵略的斗争，是争取自由和民族独立的正义爱国斗争，是捍卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民将一如既往，在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，同老挝人民并肩前进，始终不渝地支援他们的正义斗争。
    声明强调指出，老挝问题必须以老挝全国政治协商会议宣言中阐明的五项办法和四点立场为基础加以解决。如果美帝国主义悍然不顾老挝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的强烈抗议，继续进行反对老挝人民的战争活动，它必将逃脱不了更加无法挽回的悲惨失败。
    声明最后说，朝鲜人民确信，受到全世界人民积极支持和声援的英雄的老挝人民，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，在为粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和扩大战争的阴谋活动、为争取真正和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的斗争中，必将取得最后胜利。
