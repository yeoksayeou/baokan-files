    "The working class must transform the whole society in class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself. The working class must constantly learn in its work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop."
    Chairman Mao's Books Make My Eyes Bright and My Heart Clear
    Worker of the Petroleum Station in Yuci County, Shanxi Province: Wang Erhuo
    Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong said: "People's social being determines their thinking. And the correct ideas representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force for transforming society and transforming the world." The article "Chairman Mao's Books Make My Eyes Bright and My Heart Clear" uses vivid facts to demonstrate this principle of turning spirit into matter.
    Can workers and peasants who are illiterate or have very little literacy learn Chairman Mao's works well? Comrade Wang Erhuo answers: Yes! Chairman Mao's books are written for the working people, and they talk about revolutionary principles. Revolutionary people, even if they are illiterate, can completely understand and apply them by reciting, listening, and memorizing. Comrade Wang Erhuo is largely illiterate and has poor eyesight, but he does not forget the class suffering he has endured in the past, loves the Party, and loves Chairman Mao; he is convinced that to make revolution, he must study Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, no difficulty can stop him, and he has finally taken a gratifying step on the road of studying Chairman Mao's works.
    Comrade Wang Erhuo has not studied many of Chairman Mao's articles, but he has studied them thoroughly and applied them firmly. "After I hear a sentence from Chairman Mao, I feel uncomfortable until I put it into practice and turn it into action." This is Comrade Wang Erhuo's purpose and attitude in learning! Learning for the sake of revolution, focusing on the word "application," learning in application, and applying in learning. He acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions and leads everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. In a short period of time, he has greatly changed the mental outlook and work style of all the comrades in the group.
    I am illiterate and have bad eyes, a semi-blind person. I have not studied Chairman Mao's works much, and my understanding is not deep. I just think about it after listening a little, and then I do it. Now I will talk about how I listen, how I think, and how I do it.
  Difficulties Cannot Stop Me from Studying Chairman Mao's Works
    In the spring of the year before last, a upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works was launched by our petroleum station employees. After seeing the situation of everyone creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, I was very envious and wanted to learn, but I had never studied since I was a child; I didn't study culture well after I started working, and I couldn't read books or newspapers myself. What should I do? Because of this, I tossed and turned for several nights and couldn't sleep; when I couldn't sleep, I thought of many past events.
    In the old society, my family was very poor, without a house or a piece of land, and my ancestors worked as farmhands for landlords, suffering all kinds of exploitation and oppression. My grandfather starved to death; my brother worked as a farmhand for the landlord, and because he was sick and unable to work, he was driven out of the house by the landlord, and later beaten to death by the landlord. My father joined the Eighth Route Army and gloriously sacrificed himself in a battle. When I was nine years old, I went to herd sheep for the landlord, and I herded sheep for more than ten years. I switched between several "masters", but nowhere did they treat me like a human being. Until I was eighteen, I had never worn a decent pair of shoes, and I mostly ate bran bread. One year, I suffered from an eye disease, and I couldn't see anything after dark. The landlord not only refused to spend money to treat me, but also asked me to go to the fields to watch sheep at night. In 1948, my hometown was liberated, and the suffering people saw the sun. In 1954, I became a worker, and in 1959, I got married. Without the Party, without Chairman Mao, where would I, Wang Erhuo, be! Therefore, with the thought of repaying the favor, I regarded the factory as my home and worked desperately. From 1956 to 1959, I received awards from the company for four consecutive times. However, because I didn't study hard, my awareness was not high, and my level of understanding was very low, I couldn't look at comrades with a one-divides-into-two point of view. I only saw other people's shortcomings and didn't see other people's advantages. When I made suggestions, I didn't pay attention to the method, which resulted in many comrades being dissatisfied with me, and my work suffered losses. Thinking of these things, I secretly vowed: I must overcome difficulties and master Mao Zedong Thought.
    Once the determination was made and the courage was there, not knowing how to read and not being able to read books was still a practical problem. What should I do? I thought: First learn culture, and then study Chairman Mao's works after improving my culture! But how long would that take! No, I can't wait. Listening to reports and collective study of documents is a way, but this is not something that can be learned every day! Ask others to read it! The comrades are very busy with their work, and it's okay to read it a few times, but how can it work for a long time! I was very distressed when I got home, thinking, thinking, thinking, but I couldn't come up with a solution. Just then, I heard the radio next door ringing, and the radio introduced a sentence from Chairman Mao: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." Hearing this sentence, I felt warm in my heart, as if I had been enlightened. The radio reminded me: Can't I also study Chairman Mao's works by listening to the radio? So I decided to buy a radio to help me study Chairman Mao's works.
    After buying the radio, I was very happy to listen to lectures on studying Chairman Mao's works and current affairs lectures on the radio station every day. However, because my basic knowledge was poor, I couldn't understand some things, and I only knew the general meaning after listening, and it was difficult to remember clearly, so the effect was not great. At this time, I secretly made another determination: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind on it." As long as I listen carefully and listen more times, I can still learn something. Sure enough, after listening more, I could gradually understand and remember. In the process of listening to the radio, I also had quarrels with my lover. Once, after I got off work, I hurried back to turn on the radio to listen to the lecture. However, the people in the courtyard who had radios were listening to Shanxi Opera. My lover was very angry and said: "People are listening to Shanxi Opera, you don't know what you are listening to in a nagging way!" So she came over and turned it to Shanxi Opera, and I turned it to the lecture again. Turning it back and forth, she got angry, pulled out the plug, and pushed the radio aside. Later, I patiently said to her: "We bought the radio not to show off or to have fun, but to learn." I also turned over the past family history to explain the principle that to make revolution, we must study Chairman Mao's works. In this way, she also agreed to me listening to the lecture, and sometimes she listened with me. Through a period of study, her ideological awareness has also improved.
    Of course, just listening to the radio is not enough, and there must be other ways. My learning methods, put together, are called: one "carry," five "mores," and six "combinations." One carry: carry deep proletarian feelings; five mores: listen more, ask more, think more, speak more, and use more. Listen more, that is, listen to the radio and listen to others reading. Ask more, that is, if you don't understand something, ask others; the comrades in our group, the cadres in the section, the neighbors in the same courtyard, and the primary school students are all my teachers. Think more, that is, after listening each time, relate it to your own thoughts and work and think repeatedly. What has been done, what has not been done, why it has been done, and why it has not been done. Use more, that is, do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions; after I hear a sentence from Chairman Mao, I feel uncomfortable until I put it into practice and turn it into action, as if I am missing something; I only feel that I have learned a little when I have put it into practice. Speak more, that is, tell the things I have learned to the comrades in the group, so that everyone can study and do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I tell everyone about my experience in studying Chairman Mao's works, as well as the experience of others in studying Chairman Mao's works, the Three-Eight Work Style of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing Oilfield, the Party's policies, class struggle, and the comparison between the old and new societies. Six combinations: combine class struggle, domestic and international situations, the Party's policies, transforming thoughts, improving work, and advanced experiences from other places.
    Using the above methods, I have successively studied more than 30 articles, including "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Combat Liberalism," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction," and memorized more than 300 quotations. I can't remember where some words are in the article, I only know that Chairman Mao said them. After studying, my thoughts have been greatly improved, I have understood many principles, and my ability to analyze has also been enhanced. From then on, whenever I encounter a problem that I can't understand, I ask Chairman Mao's works for advice.
          Early Study, Early Progress, Late Study, Late Progress
    Our work is very important. Anything with a machine, flying in the sky, running underground, turning in factories and rural areas, cannot do without oil; even bicycles that are pedaled with feet cannot do without it. But how is our work done? The achievements are certainly great, but there are also some problems. Some people say: "Earning tens of yuan a month, working half a day, is very comfortable, and it's okay to do it for a lifetime." Some people value housework more and work less, arriving late and leaving early, and not concentrating on work. I remember once, a comrade from a certain unit came to pick up oil, and because the barrel was leaking, they looked for a solution in many places but couldn't find one. In the end, almost a barrel of oil leaked out, and the comrade left very sadly, and I was also very sad.
    At that time, I thought: Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people wholeheartedly, what kind of service to the people is this? To serve the people and to make revolution, we must first do our job well. From then on, I went to work early every day, cleaned the freight yard, sorted out the goods, and studied during rest time.
    In March of the year before last, 900 barrels of oil had to be put into the warehouse, and the leaders required them to be completed in one month. Some comrades said: In the past, there were fourteen or fifteen people, who only handled business and received customers; now there are eight people, and they are too busy with business alone, so how can they move oil into the warehouse! Not to mention a month, it will not be completed in two months! Sure enough, at the beginning, five people worked all day and only rolled twenty barrels of oil (a distance of 250 meters). I was very anxious. At this rate, when will it be completed? At this time, I remembered what Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself." The next day, I conducted experiments myself. I went to work on time and rolled eighteen barrels by myself in one morning. The third day, everyone went to work early. Some comrades said: "If Wang Erhuo can roll eighteen barrels, we can roll thirty-eight barrels." On this day, a total of 156 barrels were rolled. As a result, eight people rolled 900 barrels of oil. In addition to receiving customers and doing business as usual, it was completed in nine days. Twenty-one days ahead of the leader's request.
    Once it rained lightly at night, and when I got up in the morning, some comrades wanted to rest, but I insisted on rolling the barrels. Later, everyone started rolling. After doing this, a few comrades were very dissatisfied with me. Some people criticized me in person and said: "Why do you want to do it when others don't?"
    Regarding such things, I repeatedly thought: Why do I work hard and suffer, and still cause opposition from others after doing the work? Should I continue to work hard? Some people will object. Should I not work hard? Chairman Mao asked us to serve the people wholeheartedly and pick up the heavy burden. Finally, I remembered this passage from Chairman Mao: "We must admit difficulties, analyze difficulties, and fight against difficulties. There is no straight road in the world, and we must be prepared to take a tortuous road, and don't be greedy for cheap." I also remembered a sentence I heard on the radio: "We must dare to struggle and dare to win." I encouraged myself and said: Don't be discouraged! We must admit contradictions, not be afraid of contradictions, expose contradictions, and solve contradictions; we must stand firm and hold on.
    However, the problem is still the problem. How exactly can it be solved? Thinking, thinking, thinking, I remembered a sentence that Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "The most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism, lies in the concrete analysis of concrete conditions." Chairman Mao called for concrete analysis, how should I analyze it? I want to analyze the reasons first. After analysis, I believe that the reason why some comrades are dissatisfied with me is mainly due to the following three reasons: First, some comrades have individualistic thoughts, and they do not yet understand the relationship between individual interests and collective interests. Second, I don't care enough about everyone's life. At that time, I thought, Chairman Mao said that to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, we must care about the lives of the masses. "All these problems in the lives of the masses should be put on our agenda." In the past, I was thinking about production and work all day long, and I didn't pay attention to everyone's life. How could I mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses? Third, my ideological method is not right. I often only see other people's shortcomings and not their achievements. When I make suggestions, I only talk about shortcomings and not achievements, and my attitude is blunt. It is even more difficult to have individual heart-to-heart talks with comrades and give specific help. I also thought, these three reasons cannot be the same! Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "When studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, we must do our best to find its main contradiction. Once this main contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved easily." After comparison, I believe that the contradiction between individualism and collectivism is the main one; because once the thinking is consistent, other problems will be easier to solve.
    Now that the problem has been found, what should I do? According to Chairman Mao's teachings, and combined with the actual situation of the group, I came up with four solutions: (1) Organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's works to improve everyone's ideological awareness; (2) Work hard and do practical work to truly play an exemplary leading role; (3) Take care of comrades in life and pay attention to work methods; (4) Have individual heart-to-heart talks and patiently enlighten and guide them. I reflected my thoughts to the branch, and I got the support of the branch and administrative leaders, so I followed them one by one.
    First of all, I organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. Some comrades said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works is a matter for cadres and intellectuals. We workers just need to roll oil barrels." Some said: "We don't have culture, so we can't understand it." I explained to everyone: "Not having culture is a difficulty, but Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "The reason why Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were able to make their theories, in addition to their genius conditions, was mainly because they personally participated in the class struggle and scientific experiment practice at that time. Without this second condition, no genius can succeed." As long as we learn in connection with reality, we can understand it and we can gain something." Later, when I heard something on the radio, I repeatedly told everyone, and I would find someone in the group to read books and newspapers whenever I had time. The more everyone listened, the more they gained, and the more conscious and active they became in learning. In the past, rest time was mainly spent playing poker, but now it is mainly spent reading newspapers, talking about current affairs, and discussing Chairman Mao's works. The mental outlook of the group has changed greatly.
    Second, work hard, do practical work, and take the lead. No matter what work I do, I always pick the heavy and dirty ones, and always use the "Daqing people" and the "Daqing spirit" to strictly demand myself, and take Daqing's "Wang Tie Ren" as my example. My home is six miles away from the office, and I have never been late once. I bring my lunch and don't go home at noon. After eating, I don't rest and look for something to do. Since the year before last, I have hardly rested at noon. The comrades in the section repeatedly advised me to pay attention to rest, but I can't do work, and it's even more difficult to rest. In April of the year before last, a carload of oil was transported, a total of 248 barrels, to be put into the warehouse. I used a lunch break to roll 60 barrels; another time, I used two hours after work to stack 98 boxes of Vaseline oil. After stacking, I just went out the gate and it rained heavily. When I got home, I was soaked all over, but I felt warm in my heart.
    Third, take care of everyone in life. Every day when I go to work, I always clean the rest room first and pour a glass of water for everyone. If someone in the group is sick or on a business trip, I take the noon time to pull coal, buy rice, and buy flour for their families. The relationship between the comrades and me has gradually become closer.
    Fourth, have individual heart-to-heart talks with comrades. Comrade Fan Hongzhi in our group used to pick and choose jobs and was a little sloppy. I thought he had some dust brought from the old society, and I should help him "wash his face." At a life meeting, I criticized him by not naming him. But this made things worse. Not only did he not accept it, but he also lost his temper. At that time, I thought, I was helping him with good intentions, but he scolded me instead. What kind of work is this? I might as well ignore him. Later, I heard a passage from Chairman Mao on the radio: "The attitude of Communists towards backward people is not to despise them or look down on them, but to be close to them, unite them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." After listening to this, I felt that the attitude of ignoring him was wrong. So I took the initiative to approach him. But Fan Hongzhi avoided me and ran away when he saw me. How should I talk to him? Thinking about it, I thought I had to check myself first. So I found him, checked my own problems of being blunt and not paying attention to the occasion when making suggestions, and asked him to give me suggestions. I also took care of him in life. In this way, we started talking. I talked to him about the contrast between the lives and political status of workers in the two societies, the new and the old. Fan Hongzhi nodded after listening and said: "You are right, let's see in the future in our work!" Later, I often asked him to read newspapers to me and study Chairman Mao's works with me. In this way, on the one hand, he helped me learn new things; on the other hand, I also helped him improve his ideological awareness. From then on, Comrade Fan Hongzhi really changed. He became active and proactive in his work, and he often went to work early and used his rest time to organize the freight yard. Once, he did not rest at noon and rolled 41 barrels of oil onto the platform. He was named an excellent employee the year before last. Through the facts of Fan Hongzhi's progress, I realized that studying Chairman Mao's works is: early study, early progress, late study, late progress, whoever studies progresses, and not studying does not progress.
    After doing the above things, the situation in our group has changed dramatically. Once, when I went to work, I saw that some comrades had already started working. The guard comrade asked me: "Erhuo, why are you coming now?" I thought to myself that I had never been late before. Was I late this time? When I looked up, it was still twenty minutes before work time. I said: "It's not that I'm late, it's that they came early." The guard comrade smiled, and I smiled too. Some work that had not been completed before getting off work the day before was completed when I went to work the next day. When I asked who did it, no one said.
          Care for Customers and Protect State Property
    Our oil-filling group often deals with customers. There is a section of road in the freight yard that is bumpy, uneven, and very difficult to walk on. Customers reflected: "The road is pitted and muddy when it rains. It is so difficult to walk on." After hearing this, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings in the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility in his work and his extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." I discussed with the comrades and used the rest time to pull soil to fill the pits. In order to make the customers rest well, we picked up some waste materials and used the rest time to build a simple house as a rest room for the customers. In the past, when some customers came to pick up oil, because there were flammable items on the car, they could not enter the freight yard according to the system. The customers had to unload the flammable items, only pull the oil barrels in to pick up the oil, and then reload the car when they came out. Now, we help customers transport and load the car until it is loaded and the customers are sent away before we feel relieved. Such things have become commonplace in our group. In short, in terms of service attitude, we have achieved five "sames" and three "satisfactions." The five "sames" are: receiving customers the same whether business is busy or idle, receiving familiar and unfamiliar customers the same, receiving domestic and foreign customers the same, receiving customers the same whether it is on duty or off duty, and receiving customers the same regardless of how much oil they buy. The three "satisfactions" are: customers are satisfied, leaders are satisfied, and we are also satisfied. However, we still feel that we have not done enough.
    In the past, the oil transferred from other places was loaded into barrels and rolled in the warehouse and in front of the warehouse. The oil barrels were everywhere. When people entered the warehouse, there was really no place to put their feet. It was impossible to see which barrel was leaking oil, so the oil leakage phenomenon was very serious. In addition, because the oil barrels in the warehouse were thrown around, the barrel capacity of the warehouse was greatly affected. After studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," we were greatly inspired. Chairman Mao said: "We must make all cadres and all the people often think that our country is a large socialist country, but it is also a poor country with a backward economy. This is a big contradiction. To make our country prosperous and strong, we need decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of a policy of thrift and opposing waste." After studying this passage of Chairman Mao, I further thought about our work. There is often oil spilling and leaking at our station. Is this a small matter? This is not a small matter. Spilling a little today and leaking a little tomorrow, over time, it will accumulate. Petroleum is dug out by the comrades working in the oil fields through hard work day and night. Every drop of oil contains the sweat of people's labor; if it is wasted in our hands, it is equivalent to destroying other people's labor. In particular, petroleum is the blood of industry. If the comrades in the oil fields produce more and we keep it well, it will make more airplanes, cars, and tractors start up, so that socialist construction will be faster. If the country's construction is strong, it will have more power to support the world revolution. On the basis of study, everyone understood the relationship between a drop of oil and socialist construction and world revolution, and consciously carried out a hard work to rectify the warehouse and a thrift and frugality campaign. In the warehouse rectification, the comrades lifted the three or four hundred kilograms of oil barrels to the oil barrel piles two or three meters high. The shoulders of many comrades were swollen and broken, but they still insisted on working. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would use the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to overcome all difficulties and completely change the face of the freight yard. Some comrades caught a cold, and the leaders asked them to rest and see a doctor, but the comrades said: "The big barrel is the doctor, it will be good to sweat a few times." Thanks to everyone's hard work, all the more than 9,000 large barrels that were thrown around in the warehouse and freight yard area were stacked up. The stacking quality reached the standard of "one high, two low, and three lines," making the freight yard look brand new, and the phenomenon of oil spillage and leakage was reduced by more than 90% compared to the past. In addition, the comrades also used the gaps to extract 1,300 kilograms of residual oil from the empty barrels transferred from outside, picked up 260 large barrel lids, and also picked up many screws. In addition, the comrades used their spare time to repair roads, level the site, and save a total of more than 3,500 yuan in weeding. In terms of technical innovation, the entry and exit warehouse were realized by car, and the stacking was done by crane, which greatly reduced the labor intensity.
    Thanks to everyone's joint efforts, we have transformed from a backward group into a five-good collective. In the year-end comparison in 1964 and 1965, seven people were rated as six-good employees or excellent employees twice, and I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In the provincial oil depot inspection, our group won the first place and received commendation and rewards. It was said that we creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and our labor efficiency reached the highest level in the province at that time. The Party branch of our unit used our group as a typical example to carry out a campaign of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing throughout the station. However, our work is indeed not done well enough, there are still many shortcomings, and the gap is still very large.
    Through study, I have two experiences. Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "Marxist philosophical dialectical materialism has two most prominent characteristics: one is its class character, which openly declares that dialectical materialism is for the service of the proletariat; the other is its practicality, which emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, the foundation of theory is practice, and it in turn serves practice." I realized: Because Marxism and Chairman Mao's works are for the service of the proletariat, we must study with proletarian feelings. The so-called proletarian feeling is to love the Party, love Chairman Mao, love the motherland, love the people, love work, not forget class suffering, and not forget the two-thirds of the oppressed people in the world. Because the foundation of theory is practice, and it in turn serves practice, when studying, we must combine theory with practice, creatively study and apply, and work hard on the word "application"; learn in application, apply in learning, learn a little, and use a little. It is useless to study theory away from practice. These are my deepest two experiences. In addition, I also realized that learning must adhere to the principle of less but essential, especially for fundamental viewpoints, we must remember as much as possible; only by remembering can we think and use it repeatedly. If we are greedy for more, we will not be able to chew it, and we will not be able to remember it, so how can we think and use it repeatedly?
    The little achievement I have made is due to the Party's cultivation, Chairman Mao's teachings, and the help of the comrades. It should be attributed to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the comrades. I myself am still very poor in learning. In the future, I will never forget class hatred, learn, practice, learn again, and practice again, repeatedly and infinitely. Strive to train myself into a real proletarian warrior who cannot be overthrown by wind or thunder.

### 毛主席的书使我眼明心亮

专栏：

    “工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”
    毛主席的书使我眼明心亮
    山西省榆次县石油站工人　王二货
    编者按：毛泽东同志说过：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”《毛主席的书使我眼明心亮》一文，用活生生的事实论证了这个精神变物质的道理。
    不识字的、或者识字很少的工人、农民，能不能学好毛主席著作呢？王二货同志回答说：能！毛主席的书是为劳动人民写的，讲的是革命的道理。革命的人民，有的虽然不识字，靠念、靠听、靠记，是完全能够懂得，能够应用的。王二货同志不大识字，视力又差，但是，他不忘过去受的阶级苦，热爱党，热爱毛主席；他认定要革命，就要学习毛主席著作。所以，任何困难也阻挡不住他，终于在学习毛主席著作的路程上迈出了可喜的一步。
    王二货同志学的毛主席的文章还不多，但学得精，用得扎实。“我听到毛主席的一句话以后，什么时候兑现不了，变不成行动，什么时候就觉得不舒服。”这就是王二货同志的学习目的和学习态度！为了革命而学，狠抓一个“用”字，在学中用，在用中学。他按照毛主席的指示办事，并带动大家学习毛主席著作，没有多久，就大大改变了全组同志的精神面貌和工作面貌。
    我是个文盲，眼睛又不好，是个半失明的人。对毛主席著作学得不多，体会得不深，只是听了一点以后就想，想了以后就做。现在谈谈我是怎样听、怎样想、怎样做的。
  困难挡不住我学习毛主席著作
    前年春天，我们石油站职工掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮。我看到大家活学活用毛主席著作的情况以后，很羡慕，很想学，可是，我从小没念过书；参加工作后又没有好好学习文化，自己看不了书，读不了报。这该怎么办呢？为这事，我好几个晚上翻来复去睡不好觉；睡不着就想起了许多往事。
    在旧社会，我家很穷，房无一间，地无一垄，祖祖辈辈给地主当长工，受尽了剥削压迫。祖父活活饿死；哥哥给地主当长工，因病不能劳动，被地主赶出门，后来又被地主打死。我父亲参加了八路军，在一次战斗中光荣牺牲了。我九岁时，去给地主放羊，共放了十来年，先后转换了好几个“东家”，但到处都不把我当人看，一直到十八岁也没有穿过一双象样的鞋，吃的多是糠面窝窝。有一年，我害了眼病，天一黑什么也看不见，地主不但不肯花钱给我治，晚上还要我到地里去看羊。一九四八年，我们家乡解放了，受苦人见到了太阳。一九五四年我当了工人，一九五九年我结了婚。没有党，没有毛主席，哪里会有我王二货！因此，我抱着报恩思想，以厂为家，拼着命工作。一九五六年至一九五九年，连续四次受到了公司的奖励。可是因为自己不好好学习，觉悟不高，认识水平很低，对同志不能用一分为二的观点去看，只看别人的缺点，看不到别人的优点，提意见不讲方式，结果引起不少同志对我不满，工作受了损失。想到这些，我暗暗发誓：一定要克服困难，把毛泽东思想学到手。
    决心下了，勇气有了，但不识字，看不了书，总是个实际问题。怎么办呢？我想：先学文化，提高了文化再学毛主席著作吧！可是，那要等多久呀！不行，不能等。听报告、集体学习文件是个办法，但这也不是天天都能学呀！请别人念吧！同志们工作很忙，念几次还可以，时间长了哪能行！回到家里很苦恼，想呀，想呀，想不出个办法。正在这时，听到院邻的收音机响了，收音机里介绍毛主席的一句话：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”听到这句话，我心里热乎乎的，象开了窍。收音机提醒了我：用听收音机的办法不是也可以学习毛主席著作吗？于是就决定买个收音机，帮助我学习毛主席著作。
    收音机买下了，每天听广播电台的学习毛主席著作讲座和时事讲座，我非常高兴。可是因为自己基础知识差，有的话理解不了，听了也只知大意，难以记清，收效不大。这时我又暗下决心，“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，只要我细心听，多听几次，还是可以学到些东西的。果然听的多了，慢慢也就能理解了、记下了。在听收音机的过程中，我和爱人也发生过争吵。一次，我下了班，赶紧回去扭开收音机听讲座。可是，院里有收音机的人是听山西梆子。我爱人很生气地说：“人家听的是山西梆子，你不知唠唠叨叨地听些啥！”于是她过来一下扭在山西梆子上，我又扭在讲座上，扭过来扭过去，她生气了，把插销一拔，把收音机推在一边。后来，我耐心和她说：“我们买收音机不是为了讲阔气，图热闹，而是为了学习。”还给她翻了顿过去的家史，说明要革命就要学习毛主席著作的道理。这样，她也同意我听讲座了，有时还和我一起听。通过一段学习，她的思想觉悟也提高了。
    当然，光听收音机也不够，还得有其他办法。我的学习方法，集中起来叫做：一带，五多，六结合。一带：带深厚的无产阶级感情；五多：多听、多问、多想、多讲、多用。多听，就是听收音机、听别人念。多问，就是自己不懂的，就问别人；我们组里的同志，科里的干部，同院的邻居、小学生，都是我的老师。多想，就是每次听了以后，要联系思想，联系工作反复想，那些做到了，那些没有做到，为什么做到了，为什么没有做到。多用，就是要照毛主席的指示去办；我听到毛主席的一句话以后，什么时候兑现不了，变不成行动，什么时候就觉得不舒服，好象少了什么似的；什么时候兑了现，什么时候才感到自己又学了一点。多讲，就是把自己学到的东西，向组里的同志们讲，使大家都学习，都按毛主席的指示办事。我给大家讲自己学习毛主席著作的情况，也讲别人学习毛主席著作的经验、解放军的三八作风、大庆油田的革命精神、党的方针政策、阶级斗争以及新旧社会对比。六结合：结合阶级斗争、国内外形势、党的方针政策、改造思想、改进工作、外地先进经验。
    采用以上种种办法，我先后学习了《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》、《反对自由主义》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》等三十多篇文章，记住了三百多条语录。有些话我也记不清在那篇文章，只知道是毛主席讲的。学习后，思想有很大提高，懂得了不少道理，分析能力也增强了。从此以后，一遇到想不通的问题，就向毛主席著作请教。
          早学早进步，晚学晚进步
    我们的工作非常重要，凡是带机器的，天上飞的，地下跑的，工厂、农村里转的，那一个离了石油都不行；就连用脚踏的脚踏车，也离不开它。可是我们的工作做的怎么样呢？成绩当然很大，但问题也有一些。有人说：“每月赚上几十元，一天工作干半天，很舒服，干一辈子也行。”有人把家务看得重，把工作看得轻，迟到早退，不专心工作。记得有一次某一个单位的同志来提油，因为桶漏，找了好几个地方也没有解决，最后一桶油漏的差不多了，这位同志很痛心地走了，我也很难过。
    当时我想：毛主席教导我们全心全意地为人民服务，我们这算什么为人民服务呢？要为人民服务，要革命，就得首先把工作做好。从此以后，我每天提前上班，在休息时间打扫货场，整理商品，进行学习。
    前年三月份，有九百桶油要入库，领导要求一个月完成。有的同志说：以前十四、五个人，只是搞业务，接待顾客；现在八个人，光业务也忙不过来，那还能再搬油入库！别说一个月，就是两个月也完成不了！果然，开始五个人干了一整天，才滚了二十桶油（距离二百五十米）。我很着急，照这样速度去滚，什么时候才能完成呢？这时我想起了毛主席在《实践论》中说的：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”第二天我亲手进行试验。按时上下班，一上午一个人就滚了十八桶。第三天大家提前上班，有的同志说：“王二货能滚十八桶，咱就能滚三十八桶。”这一天，共滚了一百五十六桶。结果，八个人滚九百桶油，除了照常接待顾客、搞好业务工作外，九天就完成了。比领导的要求提前了二十一天。
    有一次夜里下了小雨，早晨起来，有的同志想休息，我坚持要滚桶，后来大家也滚开了。这样做了以后，有少数同志对我很不满意。有的人当面批评我说：“别人不干，为什么你要干？”
    对这样的事，我反复想：为什么自己吃苦受累地劳动，做了工作，还惹起别人的反对呢？继续好好干吧，有人要反对，不好好干吧，毛主席叫我们全心全意地为人民服务，拣重担子挑。最后，我想起毛主席这一段话：“我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。”还想起收音机里说过一句：“要敢于斗争、敢于胜利。”自己鼓励自己说：可不要灰心丧气啊！一定要承认矛盾，不怕矛盾，揭露矛盾，解决矛盾；一定要站得稳，顶得住。
    可是，问题总还是问题，究竟怎么解决呢？想啊，想啊，想起了毛主席在《矛盾论》中说过的一句话：“马克思主义的最本质的东西，马克思主义的活的灵魂，就在于具体地分析具体的情况。”毛主席叫具体分析，我怎么个分析法呢？我想先分析一下原因吧。经过分析，我认为：一部分同志所以对我不满，主要有以下三个原因：第一，有的同志有个人主义思想，他们还不了解个人利益同集体利益的关系。第二，我对大家的生活关心的不够。当时我想，毛主席说，要调动群众的积极性，就得关心群众生活。“一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。”而自己过去，成天考虑的是生产、工作，不注意大家的生活，怎么能够调动群众的积极性呢？第三，自己思想方法不对头。往往只看到别人的缺点，看不到别人的成绩，提意见的时候，只说缺点不说成绩，态度生硬，更不好和同志个别谈心，具体帮助。我又想，这三条原因不能一样吧！毛主席在《矛盾论》中说过：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”经过比较，我认为个人主义同集体主义的矛盾是主要的；因为思想一致了，其它问题也就好办了。
    问题找到了，怎么办呢？我又根据毛主席的教导，结合小组的实际情况，想出了四条办法：（1）组织大家学习毛主席著作，提高大家的思想觉悟；（2）自己苦干实干，真正起到模范带头作用；（3）从生活上体贴同志，并注意工作方法；（4）个别谈心，耐心启发诱导。我把自己的想法向支部作了反映，得到了支部和行政领导的支持，于是我就一条一条照着去办。
    首先，我组织大家学习毛主席著作。有的同志说：“学习毛主席著作，那是干部和知识分子的事，咱们工人光管滚油桶就行了。”有的说：“咱们没文化，学不懂。”我就给大家解释说：“没有文化是困难，但是毛主席在《实践论》中讲过：‘马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林之所以能够作出他们的理论，除了他们的天才条件之外，主要地是他们亲自参加了当时的阶级斗争和科学实验的实践，没有这后一个条件，任何天才也是不能成功的。’只要我们结合实际学，就能学得懂，就能有收获。”后来我在收音机上听到什么，就反复给大家讲，有空就找人在小组念书、读报。大家听得多了，有了收获，学习也就自觉了，主动了。过去休息时间，是以打扑克为主，现在是以读报、谈时事、讨论毛主席著作为主。小组的精神面貌有了很大改变。
    第二，苦干、实干、带头干。不论做什么工作，自己总是挑重的，拣脏的，时时拿“大庆人”、“大庆精神”严格要求自己，把大庆的“王铁人”作为自己的榜样。我家离机关六里路，我从未迟到过一次，中午带上饭不回家，吃完饭不休息就找事干。前年以来，几乎中午没有休息过。科里同志再三劝我注意休息，可是我做不了工作，休息更难过。前年四月份运来了一车油，共二百四十八桶，要入库，我利用一个中午休息时间滚了六十桶；又一次，利用下班后两个钟头，堆垛凡士林油九十八箱。堆好后，刚出大门，下了大雨，回到家里浑身淋了个湿，可心里觉得热乎乎的。
    第三，从生活上体贴大家。每天一上班，我总是先去把休息室打扫干净，给每个人倒一杯水。组内有人病了或出差了，我抽中午时间给他们家里拉煤、买米、买面等。同志们和我的关系逐渐地就密切了。
    第四，和同志们个别谈心。我组范红只同志以往干工作有时挑肥拣瘦，有些马虎。我想他这是从旧社会带来的灰尘，应帮助他“洗洗脸”。在一次生活会上，我用不指名的方法批评了他。可是这一下闹坏了，他不但不接受，反而大发脾气。当时我想，本来是好心好意帮助他，反而叫他训了一顿，这干的是个啥，干脆不理他算了。后来在广播里听了毛主席讲过的一段话：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”听了之后，我感到置之不理的态度是错误的。于是我便主动地接近他。可是范红只躲着我走，见了面一扭头就跑了。该怎样和他说呢？想来想去，我想到必须先检查自己。于是我找到他，检查了自己提意见态度生硬、不分场合的毛病，请他给我提意见。我又从生活上体贴他。这样一来，就说到一块了。我同他谈工人在新旧两种社会里生活和政治地位的对比。范红只听了点点头说：“你说的对，今后在工作上看吧！”以后，经常让他给我读报，和他一起学习毛主席著作，这样一方面他帮助我学习了新东西；另一方面我也帮助他提高了思想觉悟。从此范红只同志确实变了，工作积极主动了，经常提前上班，利用休息时间整理货场。有一次，他中午不休息，把四十一桶油滚上了站台。前年被评为优秀职工。通过范红只进步的事实，我体会到，学习毛主席著作是：早学早进步，晚学晚进步，谁学谁进步，不学不进步。
    做了上面这些事情以后，我们小组的情况大变了。有一次，我上班一看，有些同志已经干开活了。警卫同志问我：“二货，你怎么这会才来？”我心里想我没有迟到过，这次迟到了吗？抬头一看，离上班时间还差二十分钟。我说：“不是我迟到了，是他们来早了。”警卫同志笑了，我也笑了。有些活，头天下班还没办完，第二天上班一看，已经办了。问是谁办的，谁也不说。
          关心顾客，爱护国家财物
    我们灌油组，经常和顾客打交道。货场内有一段路，坑坑洼洼，高低不平，十分难走。顾客反映说：“道路坑洞，下雨泥泞，难走的要命。”我听到这种说法后，又想到毛主席在《纪念白求恩》这篇文章中的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”就和同志们商量，利用休息时间拉土，填平坑洞。为使顾客休息好，我们大家拣了一些废料，利用休息时间修了个简易房子，作为顾客的休息室。过去，有的顾客来提油时，因为车上放有易燃品，按制度不能进货场，顾客得把易燃品卸下来，光拉上油桶进去提油，出来还得重新装车。现在，我们就帮助顾客拉运装车，直到装好送走顾客才放心。象这样的事，在我们组内已成了常事。总之，在服务态度上，我们做到了五个一样，三个满意。五个一样是：业务忙闲接待顾客一样，生熟顾客接待一样，内外顾客接待一样，上班、下班接待顾客一样，买油多少接待顾客一样。三个满意是：顾客满意、领导满意、我们也满意。不过，我们还感到做得很不够。
    过去从外地调运来的油，大家装了桶，滚在库房和库房跟前就算了，横七竖八到处都是油桶。人们进了库房真是连个插足处也没有。哪个桶漏油，根本看不见，所以漏油现象非常严重。另外由于库房内的油桶到处乱扔，大大影响了库房的容桶量。学了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，我们受到了很大启发。毛主席说：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”学了毛主席这一段话，我进一步想到我们的工作。在我们站上经常有洒油漏油的现象，这是小事吗？这不是小事。今天洒一点，明天漏一点，天长日久，就会积少成多。石油是经过在油田工作的同志白天黑夜辛苦劳动挖出来的。每一滴油都包含着人们劳动流下的汗水；在我们手上白白跑掉了，就等于糟踏了别人的劳动。特别是石油是工业的血液。油田的同志生产多了，我们保管好了，就会使更多的飞机、汽车、拖拉机开动起来，这样一来，社会主义建设得更快。国家建设强大了，更有力量支援世界革命。在学习的基础上，大家明白了一滴油和社会主义建设、世界革命的关系，就自觉地开展了一个艰苦整库、勤俭节约的活动。在整库中，同志们把三四百斤重的油桶抬到两三米高的油桶垛上，许多同志的肩膀压肿了、压破了，仍坚持劳动。大家一致表示，要以“愚公移山”的精神，战胜一切困难，彻底改变货场面貌。有的同志感冒了，领导叫休息，请医生看，可是同志们说：“大桶就是医生，滚几个出出汗就好了。”由于大家辛勤劳动，把乱扔在库房里和货场区的九千多个大桶全部堆垛起来，堆垛质量达到了“一高二低三条线”的标准，使货场面貌焕然一新，洒油漏油现象比过去降低了百分之九十以上。另外，同志们还利用空隙时间，从外面调来的空桶内抽出余油一千三百公斤，拣回大桶盖二百六十个，还拣了许多螺丝钉，再加上同志们利用业余时间，自己动手修路、平整场地、锄草节约的费用共有三千五百多元。在技术革新方面，实现了出入库车子化，堆垛吊车化，大大减轻了劳动强度。
    由于大家共同努力，我们由一个落后小组变成了一个五好集体。一九六四年和一九六五年年终评比，两次都有七个人被评为六好职工或优秀职工，我光荣地参加了中国共产党。在全省油库检查中，我们小组获得了第一，得到了表扬和奖励。说我们活学活用了毛主席著作，劳动效率达到了当时全省的最高水平。我们单位的党支部，以我们小组为典型，在全站开展了活学活用毛主席著作和比学赶帮超运动。不过我们的工作确实还做得不够，缺点还很多，差距还很大。
    通过学习，我有两点体会。毛主席在《实践论》中说：“马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务。”我体会：因为马克思主义和毛主席著作是为无产阶级服务的，所以必须带着无产阶级的感情学。所谓无产阶级感情，就是要热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱祖国，热爱人民，热爱工作，不忘阶级苦，不忘世界上三分之二受压迫的人民。因为理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务，所以学习的时候，必须理论联系实际，活学活用，在
  “用”字上下功夫；学中用，用中学，学一点，用一点。离开了实践去学习理论就没有用了。这就是我最深的两点体会。另外我还体会到，学习必须坚持少而精的原则，特别是对根本性的观点要尽可能记住；只有记住了才能反复想，反复用。如果贪多，就嚼不烂，记不住，那怎么能反复想，反复用呢？
    我能取得这点成绩，是党的培养，毛主席的教导，同志们的帮助，应归功于党，归功于毛主席，归功于同志们。我自己学习得还很差。今后一定永远不忘阶级仇恨，学习、实践、再学习、再实践，循环往复，以至无穷。争取把自己锻炼成为一个风吹不倒、雷打不动、真正的无产阶级战士。
