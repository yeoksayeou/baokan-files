    New Model Abrasion Testing Machine
    The Jinan Material Testing Machine Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a new model abrasion testing machine and has officially put it into production. It can measure the wear of various metallic materials under sliding friction, rolling friction, compound friction, and intermittent contact friction. The abrasion testing machine is also equipped with recording devices for drawing and friction function speed. With the help of these devices, data can be accurately recorded during the abrasion test.
    This testing equipment, which is indispensable for factories, enterprises, scientific research departments, and universities and colleges to assess material performance, was designed by the Jinan Material Testing Machine Factory based on the technical data provided by the Mechanical Science Research Institute. Thanks to the revolutionary spirit of the entire factory's staff in striving for progress and relying on their own efforts, and with the assistance of relevant departments, they overcame many technical difficulties and successfully trial-produced the machine in just four months.

    新型磨损试验机
    济南材料试验机厂，最近试制成功一种新型磨损试验机，并且已经正式投入生产。它能测定各种金属材料在滑动摩擦、滚动摩擦、复合摩擦及间歇接触摩擦下的磨损情况。磨损试验机上还设有描绘和摩擦功能转速记录装置。借助这些装置，在进行磨损试验时就可准确记下数据资料。
    这种工厂企业、科学研究部门和大专院校考核材料性能不可缺少的试验设备，是济南材料试验机厂根据机械科学研究院提供的技术资料设计的。由于全厂职工发扬了奋发图强、自力更生的革命精神，在有关部门的协助下，克服了许多技术难关，仅用了四个月的时间就试制成功。
