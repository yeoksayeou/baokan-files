    Not Afraid of "Ghosts" Before "Huima Slope"
    Liu Qi, Furnace Chief of No. 1 Blast Furnace, Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant
    Last September, in the battle to experiment with the new technology of injecting pulverized coal into blast furnaces, we overcame numerous difficulties and increased the amount of pulverized coal injected into the blast furnace to about 20 percent of the total fuel.
    Some foreign data records that when the amount of pulverized coal injected exceeds 20 percent, various insurmountable difficulties will occur, such as poor coal combustion, decreased furnace temperature, unsmooth furnace conditions, and even malignant accidents such as "nodule formation" in the furnace. Therefore, the number of 20 percent has become a "Huima Slope" for experimenting with this new technology. When pulverized coal injection reaches this point, it can no longer move forward and can only turn back.
    Now, we have come to the front of "Huima Slope". What to do? Should we rein in and turn back in front of it, or continue to spur our horses forward? At that time, we thought: No difficulty can defeat the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. What foreigners can do, we must do; what foreigners cannot do, we must also do!
    We relied on the masses, made full estimates of the problems that may arise from continuing to increase the amount of pulverized coal injection, and took various corresponding preventive measures. Through everyone's efforts, we finally achieved a coal injection rate of 30 percent while ensuring the normal production of the blast furnace, reaching the peak of advanced world technology, and turning "Huima Slope" into "Yuema Slope".
    Through this incident, we realized that climbing the peak of advanced world technology must be fearless of "ghosts". What are "ghosts"? "Ghosts" are pessimistic and disappointed arguments that arise when people encounter difficulties in the struggle with nature. "Ghosts" are arguments of inaction when people fail to master objective laws. "Ghosts" are various foreign frameworks that remain in people's minds when they have not liberated their minds and broken superstitions. We are armed with Chairman Mao's thought that "mankind must constantly sum up experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and move forward," and we can be fearless of "ghosts," and dare to defeat "ghosts," and dare to defeat all kinds of arguments of stagnation, pessimistic arguments, and arguments of inaction.
    The reason we were able to turn "Huima Slope" into "Yuema Slope" is precisely the result of being unafraid of "ghosts."

### “回马坡”前不怕“鬼”

    “回马坡”前不怕“鬼”
    石钢炼铁厂一号高炉炉长　刘琦
    去年九月，我们在试验向高炉喷吹煤粉新技术的战斗中，突破重重困难，把吹入高炉的煤粉数量增加到占燃料总量的百分之二十左右。
    有些外国资料记载，煤粉吹入量超过百分之二十这个关，就会发生种种难以克服的困难，例如煤粉燃烧不好啦，炉内温度下降啦，炉况不能顺行啦，炉子可能出“结瘤”的恶性事故啦，等等。因此，百分之二十这个数字，对于试验这项新技术来说，简直成了一个“回马坡”，喷吹煤粉走到这里，就再也前进不得，只好勒马回头了。
    现在，我们来到了“回马坡”前。怎么办？是在它面前勒马回头，还是继续策马向前？当时，我们想：任何困难也难不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，外国人办得到的事，我们要办到，外国人办不到的事，我们也要办到！
    我们依靠群众，对继续增加煤粉喷吹量可能产生的问题作了充分的估计，并且采取了各种相应的预防措施。经过大家的努力，终于在保证高炉正常生产的情况下，使喷煤量达到了百分之三十，登上了世界先进技术的高峰，使“回马坡”变成了“跃马坡”。
    通过这件事，我们体会到，攀登世界先进技术高峰必须不怕“鬼”。什么是“鬼”？“鬼”就是人在和大自然作斗争中遇到困难时产生的悲观失望论点，“鬼”就是人在没有驾驭客观规律时表现出来的无所作为的论点，“鬼”就是在人们没有解放思想、破除迷信时残存在头脑中的各种洋框框。我们用毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的思想武装起来，就能够不怕“鬼”，而且敢于打倒“鬼”，敢于打倒各种停止不前的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为的论点。
    我们能够把“回马坡”变成了“跃马坡”，正是不怕“鬼”的结果。
