    New Semiconductor Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge
    Qiqihar Northern Radio Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a new type of pulse semiconductor ultrasonic thickness gauge.
    This new thickness gauge, after being evaluated by local scientific research departments, is compact in structure, small in size, has a reasonable circuit, and performs well. Compared with similar products that were put into production in China not long ago, the thickness measurement range has been doubled, reaching 4 to 52 millimeters, and the working environment temperature has been expanded from minus 5 degrees Celsius to plus 35 degrees Celsius, to plus 45 degrees Celsius.
    The pulse semiconductor ultrasonic thickness gauge is used to test the thickness of components or parts made of materials such as steel, lead, and cast iron. With the thickness gauge, when measuring the thickness of large components such as ship hulls and aircraft bodies, and closed containers such as boilers and pipelines, there is no need to use methods such as drilling or cutting off. Just let the instrument contact one side of the object being measured, and you can accurately measure the thickness uniformity, corrosion degree, and wear degree of the material, saving both manpower and effort. Northern Radio Factory is a small factory specializing in the production of semiconductor transistors. In order to meet the urgent needs of national industrial development, it overcame various difficulties, conquered many technical hurdles, and finally successfully trial-produced this new thickness gauge.

    新半导体超声波测厚仪
    齐齐哈尔市北方无线电厂最近试制成功一种新的脉冲式半导体超声波测厚仪。
    这种新的测厚仪经过当地科学研究部门鉴定，结构紧凑，体积小，线路合理，性能良好。它同国内不久前投入生产的同类产品相比，测厚范围扩大了一倍，达到四至五十二毫米，工作环境温度由摄氏零下五度到零上三十五度，扩大到零上四十五度。
    脉冲式半导体超声波测厚仪，是用来检验钢、铅、铸铁等材料的构件或部件厚度的。有了测厚仪，在测量船体、机体等大型构件和锅炉、管道等密闭容器的厚度时，就不必采用钻孔或截断等办法，只要让仪器接触所测物的一面，就可以准确地测量出材料的厚薄均匀程度、腐蚀程度和磨损程度，既省人又省力。北方无线电厂是个专门生产半导体晶体管的小型工厂。为了满足国家工业发展的迫切需要，克服了各种困难，攻克了许多个技术关口，终于试制成功这种新的测厚仪。
