    Qinghai’s agricultural scientific researchers, in conjunction with farmers of all ethnic groups, have, under high-altitude and cold climate conditions, cultivated eleven fine spring wheat varieties adapted to Qinghai's high-altitude and cold climate through methods such as hybridization, introduction, and line selection. Currently, in Qinghai's agricultural areas, some cultivated land at elevations of about 3,000 meters is also planted with wheat.
    The "Qingchun No. 1" spring wheat, bred through hybridization, is cold-resistant and early-maturing. Demonstrations in the fields showed that its per-mu yield exceeded 800 jin. In 1966, this variety will be widely promoted in production. The fine winter wheat variety "Abbott" introduced from Albania accounted for one-fifth of the total wheat planting area in Qinghai Province in 1965, with an average per-mu yield of over 400 jin in irrigated areas.
    A new pea variety called "Green Prairie," selected from local farmer varieties by Qinghai breeding researchers, has a growing period of only eighty to one hundred days and can be planted in high-altitude and cold areas at elevations of 3,200 meters.
    Qinghai horticultural researchers, in conjunction with farmers from vegetable production teams, have, through continuous research and experimentation, enabled many vegetables from other provinces to adapt to the high-altitude and cold climate and take root in the Qinghai Plateau.

    青海育成、引进多种作物新品种
    据新华社西宁电　青海高原的农业科学研究人员同各族劳动农民结合，在高寒气候条件下，用杂交、引种和系选等办法，育成了十一个适应青海高寒气候的春小麦良种。目前在青海高原的农业区，有些拔海三千米左右的耕地也种上小麦了。
    杂交育成的“青春一号”春小麦，耐寒早熟，在大田示范种植，亩产量超过八百斤。一九六六年，这个品种就要在生产中大面积推广。从阿尔巴尼亚引进的冬小麦良种“阿勃”，一九六五年占了青海省小麦种植总面积五分之一，川水地区平均每亩产量在四百斤以上。
    青海育种研究人员从农家品种中选育出来的一种名叫“绿色草原”的豌豆新品种，生长期只有八十天到一百天，能够在拔海三千二百米的高寒地带种植。
    青海园艺研究人员同蔬菜生产队的农民结合，通过不断的研究试验，使许多外省的蔬菜适应高寒气候，在青海高原落户。
