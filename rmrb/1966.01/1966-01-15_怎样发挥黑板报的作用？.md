    How to Give Play to the Role of Blackboard Newspapers?
    Bai Wenkui, Linyi County, Shanxi Province
    Our brigade runs a total of eight blackboard newspapers, all located on streets and in lanes, where there are many people and it's lively. However, the area under the blackboard newspapers is deserted and cold, and very few people read them. One day, when I and poor peasant Liu Wangji returned from the fields, I asked him to take a look at the blackboard newspaper with me. He said, "Looking at that is a waste of time, it's better to read the newspaper or listen to the radio." I asked, "Why?" He said, "First, the blackboard newspaper has no masthead, which fails to attract people; second, the handwriting on the blackboard newspaper is crooked, full of typos, and the sentences don't make sense; third, the reports are not timely, and the news is a month old; fourth, relevant agricultural technology knowledge cannot be found."
    Later, after research, the team changed its past practices. First, it reorganized the organization and assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for publishing on a regular basis, in coordination with the current production. Second, the masthead was fresh, the handwriting was clear, and the sentences were coherent. Third, the content was rich, and one blackboard contained both education on the Party's policies and principles, combined with current production tasks, as well as commendations of good people and good deeds, small scientific knowledge, news and current affairs, etc.
    With this change, the area under the blackboard newspaper became crowded. Many people did not go home first after work, but first ran to the blackboard newspaper to take a look. As soon as this issue came out, they asked about the time for the next issue. Poor peasant Qiao Xiujin said, "The blackboard newspaper has become our teacher, and we go to it for consultation when we don't understand something."
    If you want to run a blackboard newspaper well, you must establish a mass viewpoint. Only by thinking of the masses and starting from the masses will running the blackboard newspaper not become a mere formality.

    怎样发挥黑板报的作用？
    山西省临猗县　白文魁
    我们大队一共办有八块黑板报，都在临街巷口，人多热闹的地方。可是，黑板报下却冷冷清清，看的人很少。一天，我和贫农刘望记上地回来，要他和我看看黑板报。他说：“看那等于浪费时间，不如看看报纸，听听广播。”我问：“为什么？”他说：“一是板报没有刊头，吸引不住人；二是黑板报上字迹歪扭，错字连篇，语句不通；三是报道不及时，新闻成了一月前的事；四是有关农业技术知识找不到。”
    后来队里经过研究改变了过去的做法。一是整顿组织由专人负责，定期出版，配合当前的生产。二是刊头新鲜，字迹清晰，语句通顺。三是内容丰富，一块黑板上既有党的方针政策教育，又结合当前的生产任务，还有表扬好人好事、科学小知识、新闻时事等。
    这样一变，黑板报下挤挤攘攘，很多人下工不先回家，却先跑到黑板报下瞅瞅，这期才出，就问下期的时间。贫农乔秀进说：“黑板报成了咱的先生，不明白的事就去请教。”
    要想把黑板报办好，必须树立群众观点。只有为群众着想，从群众出发，办黑板报才不会流于形式。
