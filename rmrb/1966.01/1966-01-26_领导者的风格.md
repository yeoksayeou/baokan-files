    At a worker's meeting in the titanium dioxide powder workshop of the Liaoyang Metallurgical Construction and Chemical Factory, people praised worker Chen Zhenwu for his high-quality work. He quickly pointed his thumb at the team leader Zhang Zhenyan and said, "This honor should go to him!"
    It turned out that Chen Zhenwu had been transferred from another factory a few months ago. After arriving at the factory, he worked hard to learn the technology and made rapid progress. Unexpectedly, he made a quality accident during independent operation. He felt very sad. Team leader Zhang Zhenyan saw this and, while helping him summarize the experience and lessons learned, comforted him: "This accident is not your fault, because you just arrived, and I didn't help you enough, ..." After saying that, he picked up a pen and recorded the accident under his own name. No matter how Chen Zhenwu disagreed, the team leader insisted that he should bear the primary responsibility.
    The sincere feelings of his class brother deeply moved Chen Zhenwu. From then on, he studied even harder, and Zhang Zhenyan continued to help him enthusiastically, so that his operating skills became more refined and his work quality improved significantly. Chen Zhenwu believes that these are all the results of the team leader's help.
    A leading cadre, when a subordinate makes a mistake in his work, should first check the responsibilities he should bear and take the initiative to assume responsibility for the subordinate. This is the leadership style that a leader should have. This is not only beneficial to improving one's own leadership level, but also beneficial to encouraging subordinates to correct mistakes. In this regard, we should learn from this team leader.

    领导者的风格
    辽阳冶建化工厂钛日粉车间的一次职工大会上，人们赞扬工人陈振武质量过得硬，他却赶忙把大拇指伸向班长张振岩，说：“这荣誉该给他！”
    原来，陈振武是几个月前才从别厂调来的，到厂后努力学习技术，进步很快。不料有一次，他在独立操作中出了质量事故。他心里很难过。班长张振岩看见了，一面帮他总结经验教训，一面安慰他：“这次事故不怨你，因为你刚来，我对你帮助不够，……”说罢，拿起笔来就把这次事故记在自己的名下。任凭陈振武怎么不同意，班长还是执意认为应当由他来负主要责任。
    阶级兄弟的诚挚心意深深感动了陈振武，从此他更加发愤学习，张振岩也依然热情帮助，使他的操作技术精益求精，工作质量显著提高。陈振武认为这些都是班长帮助他的结果。
    一个领导干部，当被领导者在工作中出了错误的时候，应该首先检查自己应负的责任，主动为被领导者承担责任。这是领导者应该具有的领导风格。这不但对提高自己的领导水平有好处，对鼓励被领导者改正错误也有好处。就这一点讲，我们应该向这位班长学习。
