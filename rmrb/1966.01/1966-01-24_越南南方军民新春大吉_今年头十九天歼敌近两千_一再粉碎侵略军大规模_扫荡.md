    Hanoi, January 23rd (Xinhua) - According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, initial statistics show that in the first nineteen days of this year, the South Vietnamese army and people annihilated nearly two thousand enemy troops, including one thousand six hundred and seventy-two American aggressor troops and South Korean mercenaries; shot down or damaged forty-five enemy aircraft; and destroyed fifteen enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and two other military vehicles.

    In particular, the army and people of the areas of Tân An, Thủ Dầu Một, and Gia Định have achieved great victories in the new year. They have successively crushed two large-scale "mopping-up" operations launched by the American aggressor troops in collusion with Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, annihilating more than a thousand enemy troops. The guerrillas in this area have also continuously tightened the encirclement around the Saigon nest of the U.S.-puppet clique, making the American aggressors and their running dogs very panic-stricken.

    In the eight days from December 31st of last year to January 8th of this year, the army and people of Tân An and Thủ Dầu Một areas defeated a large "mopping-up" operation launched by two battle groups composed of American aggressor troops, Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, and South Vietnamese puppet troops against Đức Huệ and Đức Hòa counties, annihilating eight hundred enemy troops, including six hundred American aggressors, and shooting down eleven enemy aircraft. Subsequently, from January 8th to 14th, the army and people of Gia Định province repelled another "mopping-up" operation by eight thousand American aggressor troops and Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, annihilating more than five hundred enemy troops, shooting down or damaging thirty enemy aircraft, and destroying eleven enemy M-113 armored vehicles.

    In addition, the army and people of Bình Định province crushed the "mopping-up" operations conducted by two regiments of South Korean mercenaries against An Nhơn, Tuy Phước, and Phù Cát counties on January 9th and 10th, annihilating four hundred and one enemy troops and shooting down two enemy aircraft.

    At the same time, local troops and guerrillas in Cần Thơ, Sóc Trăng, Bà Rịa, Thủ Dầu Một, Biên Hòa, Thừa Thiên, Quảng Nam, Phú Yên and other provinces have also repeatedly repelled multiple "mopping-up" operations by the enemy, eliminating many enemies.

    Hanoi, January 23rd (Xinhua) - According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in the northern area of Biên Hòa province, South Vietnam, killed or wounded one hundred enemy troops and captured twenty-eight in an attack on the enemy stronghold in Minh Thanh commune, Châu Thành district, on the 17th.

    At 3:45 am on the 17th, the liberation armed forces launched an attack on two companies of puppet special forces stationed in the first "strategic hamlet" in this commune. After an hour of combat, the liberation armed forces annihilated a large number of the defending enemy and completely occupied the "strategic hamlet" and the nearby Minh Thanh Airport.

    越南南方军民新春大吉
    今年头十九天歼敌近两千  一再粉碎侵略军大规模“扫荡”
    新华社河内二十三日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，据不完全统计，越南南方军民在今年的头十九天里共歼灭敌军近两千名，其中包括美国侵略军和南朝鲜雇佣军一千六百七十二名；击落击伤敌机四十五架；击毁敌M—113型两栖装甲车十五辆和其他军车二辆。
    特别是新安、堤岸、嘉定地区军民在新的一年里取得了很大的胜利，他们先后粉碎了美国侵略军伙同澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军发动的两次大规模“扫荡”，歼敌千余名。这个地区的游击队还不断缩紧了对美伪集团巢穴——西贡的包围圈，使美国侵略者及其走狗非常恐慌。
    在从去年十二月三十一日到今年一月八日为止的八天中，新安、堤岸地区军民击败了由美国侵略军、澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军以及南越伪军所组成的两个战团对德惠、德和等县发动的大“扫荡”，歼敌八百名，其中包括美国侵略者六百名，击落敌机十一架。接着，嘉定省军民从一月八日至十四日又击退了八千名美国侵略军和澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军的一次“扫荡”，歼敌五百多名，击落、击伤敌机三十架，击毁敌M—113型装甲车十一辆。
    另外，平定省军民在一月九日和十日两天粉碎了南朝鲜雇佣军两个团对安仁、绥福、符吉等县进行的“扫荡”，歼敌四百零一名，击落敌机两架。
    在这同时，芹苴、朔庄、巴地、土龙木、边和、承天、广南、富安等省的地方部队和游击队也接连击退了敌军的多次“扫荡”，消灭许多敌人。
    新华社河内二十三日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省北部地区解放武装力量，十七日在进攻周城县明盛乡敌军据点的战斗中，打死打伤敌人一百名，俘虏二十八名。
    十七日凌晨三时四十五分，解放武装力量向驻扎在这个乡的第一“战略村”的两连伪军别动队发动进攻。经过一小时的战斗，解放武装力量在大量歼灭守敌后，全部占领了这个“战略村”和附近的明盛机场。
