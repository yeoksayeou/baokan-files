    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th - The First Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference passed a series of sub-resolutions on urgent issues and the problems of new and old colonialism at its final plenary session on the 15th, condemning the crimes of aggression of imperialism headed by the United States in various regions of the three continents, and supporting the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

    The resolution on Korea stated, "The conference demands the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea, the root of all the misfortunes of the South Korean people and the main obstacle to the reunification of Korea, and actively supports the Korean people's struggle to achieve national reunification independently without external interference."

    The resolution stated, "Considering that crushing the conspiracies of the Japanese militarists is an urgent task for peace in Asia and the world, as the Japanese militarists, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are embarking on the road of aggression against Asia, the conference fully supports the Korean people's struggle to reject the 'ROK-Japan Treaty' and to crush the conspiracy to establish a 'Northeast Asia Military Alliance'."

    The resolution on Cambodia "demands that the governments of all truly anti-imperialist countries take urgent and concrete measures to end the United States' bellicose policies towards Cambodia and the U.S. and its mercenaries' crimes of aggression against the people of Indochina." The resolution demands that all countries upholding justice and loving peace "refuse to conduct political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural cooperation with the U.S. government and all governments that actively support the U.S.'s aggressive policies in Indochina."

    The resolution on Laos "actively supports the Lao people's struggle against North American imperialist aggressors and their puppets, to uphold the 1962 Geneva Agreements on the Lao question, and to defend the tripartite national unity government and the neutrality of Laos. Firmly supports the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces' National Political Consultative Conference's position, as announced in its declaration of October 13, 1965, regarding the four points and five measures for resolving the Lao question."

    The resolution on Thailand "strongly condemns U.S. imperialism for occupying and turning Thailand into its new colony, and for colluding with the Thanom-Praphas reactionary clique to arrest, enslave, and persecute Thai democrats and patriots using police and armed forces," "strongly condemns U.S. imperialism for using Thailand as a military base to carry out aggressive wars against Vietnam and Laos, and to threaten Cambodia and other countries in Southeast Asia." "The conference demands that U.S. imperialism remove all military bases in Thailand, withdraw all its troops and the headquarters of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization from there," and expresses its firm "support for the armed struggle and other forms of struggle of the Thai people."

    The resolution on supporting the struggle of the Japanese people stated: Considering that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces, and for independence, peace, and democracy, is of utmost importance, the conference "fully supports the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam, against the 'ROK-Japan Treaty,' demanding the removal of U.S. military bases and the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan, demanding the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands occupied by the U.S. to Japan, opposing the entry of U.S. nuclear submarines into Japanese ports, opposing Japan's establishment of nuclear weapons and turning Japan into a base for launching nuclear attacks, opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, and adopting the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

    The resolution on Indonesia stated: "Developments show that right-wing elements and reactionaries within the Indonesian army have launched an offensive against the Indonesian people and nation as the main force, undermining democratic freedoms, and splitting the national anti-imperialist united front that had made significant contributions to defending and striving for national independence and strengthening the struggle for solidarity among the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are currently strengthening and intensifying their anti-people and anti-communist movement."

    The resolution stated: "The Indonesian people, especially the workers and peasants who have been tempered in long years of struggle, faced with the barbaric actions of the Indonesian reactionaries, have stood up to carry out more resolute resistance through various forms of struggle."

    The resolution stated: "The conference fully trusts in the firm solidarity and solidarity of the progressive forces of Indonesia and the peoples of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in their common and unyielding struggle against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, and strongly protests against the anti-democratic actions of the Indonesian reactionaries in power, demanding the restoration of democratic freedoms in Indonesia and the release of all arrested democrats."

    The resolution on Malaya stated, "The conference strongly supports the national liberation struggle of the people of Malaya (including Singapore) and North Kalimantan."

    The resolution on Congo (Leopoldville) stated, "Affirms that the conference fully supports the armed struggle of the Congolese people for liberation." "Strongly opposes and condemns the military fascist regime fostered by U.S. imperialists and their accomplices in the Congo." "Demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the mercenaries currently in the Congo and the dismantling of the military bases in Kamina and Kitona."

    The resolution on Palestine condemned the United States, West Germany, and Britain for protecting and supporting Israel and providing it with devastating armaments. The resolution expressed "full support for the Palestine Liberation Organization's struggle to liberate Palestine."

    The resolution on the Dominican Republic "condemns the U.S. imperialist government as the aggressor and violator of the sovereignty of the Dominican people." "Condemns the Organization of American States as a thorough political tool of North American imperialism to implement neo-colonial rule in Latin America." "Condemns the organization of the Inter-American Peace Force because it violates the sovereignty of the peoples of all countries and because it embodies international counter-revolution in Latin America." The resolution demands the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and all foreign troops from Dominican territory.

    The resolution on Peru stated that the conference "decides to firmly support, in all forms, the armed struggle being carried out in Peru, which the Peruvian people have heroically chosen as a way to achieve their clear and complete economic and political independence."

    The resolution on Venezuela stated, "U.S. imperialism has clearly declared that it knows no other way than force." The resolution stated that Venezuela has chosen armed struggle as the best means of struggle against imperialism.

    The resolution on the human rights of African Americans in the United States stated: "The struggle waged by African Americans in the United States against racial oppression has never been so widespread and intense, and the people of black communities are increasingly seeing that their struggle for liberation is consistent with the struggle of the oppressed and exploited people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

    The resolution stated: "In the uprisings in Watts (Los Angeles) and Chicago, African Americans openly declared that they are fighting racism and U.S. imperialism in a common cause with their Vietnamese brothers." The resolution decided: "1. To give the strongest support to African Americans who are struggling for human rights and survival and to the progressive forces that uphold this struggle. 2. To condemn the murder of Malcolm X, to condemn the arbitrary arrest of William Epton and others, who are victims of the imperialist's frenzied violence against its leaders and fighters."

    关于支持日本人民斗争的决议说：考虑到日本人民为反对美帝国主义和日本反动力量、争取独立、和平和民主而展开的斗争具有极其重要的意义，会议“全力支持日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略越南、反对‘日韩条约’、要求美国撤除军事基地和撤退驻日美军、要求把美国占领的冲绳和小笠原群岛归还日本，反对美国核潜艇进入日本港口、反对日本建立核武装和把日本变成发动核攻击的基地、反对复活日本军国主义、采取废除日美安全条约的斗争。”
    关于印度尼西亚的决议说：“事态发展是，印度尼西亚军队内的右派分子和反动分子作为主要力量进攻了印度尼西亚人民和国家，破坏了民主自由，分裂了曾经为各国人民保卫和争取民族独立以及加强亚非拉美人民团结的斗争作出了重大贡献的全国反帝统一战线。他们目前正在加强和加紧进行反人民和反共的运动。”
    决议说：“印度尼西亚人民，特别是在长期斗争年代中百炼成钢的工人和农民，面临印度尼西亚反动派的野蛮行动，已站出来通过各种斗争形式进行更坚决的抵抗。”

    关于美国非洲（裔）美国人人权的决议说：“美国的非洲（裔）美国人展开的反对种族压迫的斗争从来没有这样广泛和激烈，黑人住区的人民越来越看到他们争取解放的斗争同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的被压迫、被剥削的人民斗争是一致的。”
