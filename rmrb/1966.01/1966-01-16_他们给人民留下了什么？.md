    What Have They Left for the People?
    Zhang Mouhou
    The Fourth Platoon of the Seventh Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region is an advanced platoon in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Last October, they came to the Bohai Bay area for field training and stayed in the homes of fishermen commune members. The soldiers thought: Chairman Mao's writings are the common wealth of the revolutionary people of our country and the world. We should not only study them well ourselves, but also have the responsibility to spread them to the masses.
    The entire platoon selected four study tutors, preparing to start by helping their landlords study.
    The landlord, Brother Li, was a fisherman commune member from a poor peasant background. He had an old mother and a wife, and life was getting better every day, but he had somewhat forgotten the bitter days of the past.
    This evening, Platoon Leader Guo Wenxuan and new recruit Liu Xufeng came to Brother Li's home. As soon as they entered the house, they presented the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Brother and Sister Li, saying, "Brother and Sister, the words in this book are all spoken by our Chairman Mao, and they are very important." Brother Li said, "Really? Then read a few sentences for me to hear." Guo Wenxuan opened the "Quotations" to the "Relationship between the Army and the People" section and read: "The army must become one with the people so that they see it as their own army. Such an army will be invincible."
    "Oh!" Sister Li said upon hearing this, "You get up before dawn every day to fetch water, sweep the yard, help the people grind flour and pick up firewood, and keep busy doing good deeds. You are doing what Chairman Mao said!"
    This excerpt aroused great interest in Brother and Sister Li. Then Guo Wenxuan changed the subject and began, "Brother Li, we have never been to the seaside before. We don't know what the life of fishermen was like before liberation?"
    When the subject of pre-liberation times was brought up, Brother Li's face darkened. He said, "In the old society, fishermen were dealing with death all day long. No one knew which day they would die at sea."
    Hearing her son talking about the old society, the old mother, who was staying in the inner room, interjected, "At that time, we fishermen were extremely miserable. The fishing tyrants wanted fish regardless of the life or death of others, forcing us to go to sea whether the weather was good or bad. Whenever there was a gale, no fisherman in the whole village could sleep. They all ran to the shore to cry, waiting for their loved ones. Some waited to see them return, and some never came back. His third uncle was overturned and killed in the wind and waves."
    Sister Li continued, "The fishing tyrants didn't give us rice, and there was no food at home, so we had to beg for food. It was hard to bear the feeling of begging for food in thin clothes on a snowy day..."
    At this critical juncture, Guo Wenxuan began to explain "class analysis" to the landlord's family. He talked about how the landlords exploited the poor, and finally talked about who our enemies were and who our saviors were, which made the whole family listen attentively. After Guo Wenxuan finished speaking, Brother Li said, "You spoke really well. After we heard it, our hearts felt like a lamp had been lit." Guo Wenxuan said, "This is not what I said, this is what our Chairman Mao said." Brother Li said, "Thanks to you for coming, otherwise we wouldn't have heard Chairman Mao's words!"
    Seeing that the time was ripe, Guo Wenxuan said, "If Brother and Sister like it, we will often come to read Chairman Mao's books to you in the future."
    Brother Li and Sister Li both happily said, "That would be great, but it's too much trouble for you."
    New recruit Liu Xufeng said, "No trouble at all, we are happy to do it!"
    From that day on, Guo Wenxuan and the comrades of the Fourth Platoon would go to study Chairman Mao's writings with the landlord whenever they had time.
    After Brother and Sister Li studied Chairman Mao's writings, their spiritual outlook changed greatly. Brother Li participated in collective labor with even greater enthusiasm, worked tirelessly, and helped neighbors do good deeds. Seeing that the soldiers' quilts on the kang were thin, he quietly spread straw on them. When Sister Li saw the soldiers' dirty clothes being taken off, she wanted to help wash them. When the soldiers wouldn't let her, she said, "Are you only allowed to serve the people and not us to serve you?"
    The matter of the Li family's ideological outlook changing after studying Chairman Mao's writings spread throughout the village like a spring breeze. When the Fourth Platoon went to guide the Li family's studies again, the commune members in the neighborhood also actively participated, from one household to two, from two households to five... During the two months of field training, they successively tutored nearly one hundred times for the landlord and the surrounding commune members. After this "point" of the Fourth Platoon became red, the activities of all platoons in the entire company to tutor the landlord and the surrounding masses to study Chairman Mao's writings were also enthusiastically launched. Before long, this "area" of the Seventh Company also became red. The troops stationed in other fishing villages also helped the commune members carry out the activities of studying Chairman Mao's writings from points to areas.
    Now, the troops have left, but Mao Zedong Thought remains in the hearts of the commune members...

    他们给人民留下了什么？
    张谋厚
    北京部队某部七连四班是个学习毛主席著作的先进班。去年十月间，他们来到渤海湾一带野营，住到渔民社员家里。战士们想到：毛主席著作是咱们全国和全世界革命人民的共同财富，咱们不仅自己要学好，也有责任把它传播给群众。
    全班选出了四名学习辅导员，准备先从帮助房东学习做起。
    房东李大哥，是个贫农出身的渔民社员，家有老妈妈，也有媳妇，日子过得一天比一天好，就是有点把过去的苦日子忘记了。
    这天晚上，班长郭文选和新战士刘旭峰来到李大哥家里。他们一进屋，就把那本鲜红的《毛主席语录》送到大哥大嫂跟前，说：“大哥大嫂，这本书里的话，全都是咱毛主席讲的，可重要哩。”李大哥说：“是吗，那你们念几句我听听。”郭文选翻开语录“军民关系”一段念了起来：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下，……”
      “哟！”李大嫂听到这里就说：“你们每天天不亮就起来挑水、扫院，帮百姓推磨、拣柴禾，忙个不停做好事，就是按毛主席说的做啊！”
    一段语录，引起了大哥大嫂很大的兴趣。接着郭文选把话一转又开腔了：“李大哥，过去我们没到过海边，不知解放前渔民的日子过得怎样？”
    一提起解放前，大哥的脸阴下来了。他说：“旧社会渔民整天都在和死字打交道，谁也不晓得那天死在海里。”
    住在里屋的老母亲听到儿子谈起了旧社会就插话说：“那时候，咱们渔民苦极了，渔霸要鱼不顾别人死活，好天坏天都叫出海，一刮风全村渔民谁也睡不着觉，都跑到岸上去哭，等亲人，有的等回来了，有的就等不回来，他三伯就是被风浪翻死在海里的。”
    李大嫂接着说：“渔霸不给米，家里没饭吃，只得去要饭，大雪天穿薄衣去要饭，那个滋味可不好受……”
    就在这个节骨眼上，郭文选给房东一家讲起了“阶级分析”来，他讲到地主怎样剥削穷人，最后说到谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的救星，使这一家人都听得入了神。等郭文选一讲完，李大哥就说：“你讲得真好啊，俺们一听心里就跟点着灯一样。”郭文选说：“这那是我讲的啊，这是咱毛主席讲的。”李大哥说：“多亏你们来，要不俺还听不到毛主席的话呢！”
    郭文选看到时机已经成熟，就说：“要是大哥大嫂喜欢，我们以后就常来把毛主席的书读给你们听。”
    李大哥和李大嫂都高兴地说：“那敢情好，就是太麻烦你们了。”
    新战士刘旭峰说：“不麻烦，我们还高兴呢！”
    从这天起，郭文选和四班的同志一有空就去和房东一起学习毛主席著作。
    李大哥和李大嫂学习了毛主席著作以后，精神面貌变化可大了。李大哥参加集体劳动热情更高了，干起来有用不完的劲，还帮邻居做好事，看到战士们炕上被薄就悄悄铺上稻草。李大嫂看到战士们的脏衣服换下来，她就要帮着洗。战士们不让她干，她就说：“就许你们为人民服务，不许我们为你们服务？”
    李大哥一家学习毛主席著作思想面貌变了样这件事，就象春风一样传遍了全村。在四班再去辅导李大哥家学习的时候，左邻右舍的社员也都积极地参加进来，由一户到二户，由二户到五户……。野营两个多月时间，他们就先后辅导了房东和周围社员学习近一百次。四班这一“点”红起来以后，全连各班辅导房东和周围群众学习毛主席著作的活动也热烈开展起来了。没多久七连这一“片”也红起来了。驻在其它渔村的部队也从点到片帮助社员把学习毛主席著作的活动开展了起来。
    现在，部队走了，然而，毛泽东思想却留在社员心中……。
