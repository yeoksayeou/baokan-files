    Farmers—these are the main objects of China's cultural movement at the present stage. What is called eliminating illiteracy, what is called popularizing education, what is called mass literature and art, what is called national health, wouldn't most of it become empty talk if separated from the 360 million farmers?
    —On Coalition Government
    Beating Drums on Red Rock Mountain
    Zhang Yude, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch of Jin'ao Brigade, Shahe Commune, Guangyuan County, Sichuan Province

    Jin'ao Brigade in Shahe Commune, Guangyuan County, Sichuan Province, is located in a poor mountain gully with high mountains, steep slopes, deep gullies, narrow roads, infertile soil, and thin land. That place is truly "you bump your nose going uphill, and ride a donkey going downhill," "when it rains, the water flows away, a big rain leaves only stones." But in recent years, we have controlled mountains and rivers, improved the soil, and transformed slopes, completely changing this poor mountain gully. In this great struggle against nature, the brigade's "Culture Room" has played a certain role in coordination with various tasks.

      Struggle for Ideological Positions
    The "Culture Room" of Jin'ao Brigade was established in August 1963. From the beginning, we made studying Chairman Mao's works the center of our activities. Through study, the broad masses of cadres and young people have clarified their direction and future, and gained the strength to overcome difficulties. Our young people enthusiastically took up their pens and wrote hundreds of poems praising the Party, praising Chairman Mao, and promoting Mao Zedong Thought, as their insights from studying Chairman Mao's works.

    According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we have made carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology the prominent task of the "Culture Room." In our brigade, there were several elderly people who used to sing old books to everyone, making the young people think wildly all day long, have no energy for production, and be afraid of ghosts when they went out at night. The commune members said: "If this continues to develop, what kind of socialism are we going to build?"

    Zhang Bijie, the Party member and brigade leader, said to us: "They sing old books, don't you know how to sing new books? Only with new books can you have weapons to overwhelm old books." This is very true. The Communist Youth League branch and the "Culture Room" decided to help and cultivate Zhang Fuyuan, a returned educated youth, to learn to sing new books, and look for opportunities to let the new books and old books directly confront each other, to see who is superior, and to seize the storytelling position.

    On the fourth day of the fourth lunar month in April 1964, the young man Yang Rongtang got married and invited an old gentleman to sing *An'an Delivers Rice*. After lunch, the old gentleman set up his desk in the kitchen, cleared his throat twice, and began to sing: "Life in this world is nothing to be happy about, like ants passing through spring and autumn, the King of Hell has decided the number at birth, without virtue, how can one live long?..." Just after singing the beginning, two sounds of "pa, pa" were heard from the next room, and the new storytelling *Taking Naitou Mountain by Strategy* began:
    "It is said that the detachment divided its forces into three routes and marched straight towards Naitou Mountain..." The storytelling was vivid and lively. The thirty or so listeners sitting in the kitchen moved to the hall one after another. The old gentleman saw that all his listeners had slipped away, so he had to close his book and turn to the hall. He stood in the crowd and looked up, exclaimed "Ah," and ran away. It turned out that this new storyteller, Zhang Fuyuan, was his son.

    After Zhang Fuyuan started telling new stories, the masses welcomed him very much, and also asked to hear stories about their hometown. With the help of the Communist Youth League branch, Zhang Fuyuan thought hard and finally composed a storytelling *Great Battle of Red Rock Mountain*, which told the story of Jin'ao Brigade learning from the spirit of Dazhai and transforming the steep slope of Hongyanzi. As soon as the storytelling mentioned the voice and appearance of a certain person, the commune members guessed who was coming on stage, and said happily: "Listen, we ourselves are also on the book, how exciting!"

    From then on, no one sang old books on Jin'ao Mountain anymore. This battle made many people realize that literature and art are sharp weapons of class struggle. Many educated young people took up their pens, participated in creation, and plunged into the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.

      Boosting Production Enthusiasm
    Chairman Mao said that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and should be used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our "Culture Room" used various forms of literature and art to boost enthusiasm for agricultural production.

    Guangyuan has a folk art form called mountain song and drum. This is sung directly in the process of production and labor. Every time when digging or weeding, songs and drums are heard all over the hills, and when labor doesn't stop, neither do the songs and drums.

    Mountain songs and drums were originally created by the working people, but in the old society, influenced by feudal ideology, they were mixed with a lot of dross, and many were lewd. After liberation, everyone felt that mountain songs and drums also needed to break the old and establish the new. Old poor peasant Wang Jianji is a famous singer. For more than ten years, under the care of the Party, he has added a lot of new content to the old tunes, which is deeply loved by the masses. The Communist Youth League branch and the "Culture Room" mobilized young people to learn from Wang Jianji, and, in coordination with the central tasks, compiled and sang new mountain songs and drums. In 1964, the *Battle of the Three Autumns* we compiled praised the good cadres and good commune members in the Three Autumns campaign, encouraged the labor enthusiasm of cadres and commune members, and accelerated the progress of the "Three Autumns."

    However, the commune members not only wanted to listen to storytelling and mountain songs, but also wanted to watch plays. We also took on this task without hesitation. And we created the first play, *Old Man Wang Hosts a Feast*.

    After a bumper harvest in 1963, there was a waste of holding banquets and giving gifts in the team. Commune member Ma Wancheng, when marrying off his daughter, advocated holding twenty tables of banquets and asking the man for a斗*dou* of rice and flour. The daughter opposed, but the old man insisted on arranging it. Just at this time, *Old Man Wang Hosts a Feast* was staged. It criticized the extravagant and wasteful style. After watching the play, the son-in-law and daughter were confident and took the opportunity to persuade the old man. The brigade leader also rushed to enlighten him in many ways, and finally he changed his mind, and at the same time stopped the trend of holding banquets in the whole team.

    After the first play played a role, it increased the confidence of writing plays. We have successively created operas such as *Rush to Final Accounting*, *Four Red Members of the Commune*, *Sending My Brother to Join the Army*, etc. All were welcomed by the commune members.

    Greatly Write About Heroic Figures
    The more we write about heroic figures in storytelling, poetry, and drama, the more heroic figures there are. Encouraged by the deeds of the heroic figures, and under the urgent demands of the masses, we continue to greatly and specially write about heroic figures. The development of this situation has made many young people take up their pens, the team of amateur writers has continued to expand, and the vivid scene of heroic figures writing about heroic figures has appeared. The heroic figures under the pen of heroic figures have the most distinct thoughts and the most abundant emotions, and they are inspiring to read. New people and new things, and heroic figures emerge in endlessly. After writing a batch, a new batch appears, which can never be finished. We deeply feel that our era is a great era, and heroes emerge in large numbers. We must always write and sing forever. (Attached picture)

### 红岩山上擂战鼓

    农民——这是现阶段中国文化运动的主要对象。所谓扫除文盲，所谓普及教育，所谓大众文艺，所谓国民卫生，离开了三亿六千万农民，岂非大半成了空话？
    ——论联合政府
    红岩山上擂战鼓
    四川省广元县沙河公社金鳌大队团支部书记　张玉德
    四川广元县沙河公社金鳌大队，是在一个山高、坡陡、沟深、路窄、土瘦、地薄的穷山沟里。那个地方啊，真是“上山撞鼻，下山骑驴”，“天上下雨地上流，一场大雨光石头”。可是最近几年来，我们治山治水、改良土壤，改变坡地，使这个穷山沟完全变了样。在这场同自然的巨大斗争中，大队的“文化室”配合各项任务，起了一定的作用。
      争夺思想阵地
    金鳌大队的“文化室”，是一九六三年八月办起来的。一开始，我们就把大学毛主席著作作为活动的中心。通过学习，广大干部和青年都认清了方向和前途，获得了战胜困难的力量。我们的青年热情地提起笔来，写了上百篇歌颂党、歌颂毛主席，宣传毛主席思想的诗篇，作为学习毛主席著作的心得。
    根据毛主席的教导，我们把开展兴无灭资斗争，作为“文化室”的突出的任务。我们大队有几个老年人，过去经常给大家唱旧书，唱得青年整天胡思乱想，搞生产没有劲，夜晚出门还怕鬼。社员都说：“这样发展下去，还搞啥子社会主义？”
    党员大队长张必举对我们说：“他们唱旧书，你们不晓得唱新书吗？有了新书，才有武器去压倒旧书。”这话很对。团支部和“文化室”决定帮助和培养回乡知识青年张福元，让他学唱新书，并且寻找机会，让新书和旧书直接交锋，见个高低，把说书阵地夺过来。
    一九六四年四月初四，青年杨荣堂结婚，请了一个老先生去唱《安安送米》。晌午过后，老先生在厨房内摆下书桌，清咳两声，开言唱道：“人生在世莫欢愁，好比蝼蚁度春秋，出世阎王定了数，无有阴功岂长留？……”刚唱完书头，只听得隔壁厅房里“啪，啪”两声，新评书《智取奶头山》开了场：
  “话说小分队分兵三路，直向奶头山挺进……”。说得有声有色，十分热闹。坐在厨房内的三十几个听众，一个接一个转移到厅房里去了。老先生看到他的听众全部溜了，只好合上唱本，转身来到厅房。他站在人群里抬头一看，“呀”了一声，拔腿就走。原来，这个新说书人张福元正是他的儿子。
    张福元说开新评书以后，群众十分欢迎，还要求听本乡本土的故事。在团支部的帮助下，张福元苦思苦想，终于编出了一段评书《大战红岩山》，说的是金鳌大队学习大寨精神，改造红岩子陡坡的事。评书一提起某人的声音面貌，社员们就猜到那一个人出场了，高兴地说：“听听，我们自己也上了书了，好扎劲啊！”
    从此以后，金鳌山上再也没有人说唱旧书了。这一场争夺战使很多人认识到文艺是阶级斗争的锐利武器。许多有文化的青年都提起笔来，参加了创作，投入了兴无灭资的斗争。
      鼓添生产干劲
    毛主席说，文艺要为工农兵服务，要为工农兵所利用。我们的“文化室”，运用了各种文艺形式，为农业生产添干劲。
    广元有一种民间文艺形式——山歌锣鼓。这是直接在生产劳动过程中演唱的。每到挖地、锄草时，歌声锣声遍山岗，劳动不停，歌声锣声也不停。
    山歌锣鼓本来是劳动人民的创作，但在旧社会，受了封建思想的影响，掺杂了不少糟粕，许多是黄色的。解放以后，大家感到山歌锣鼓也需要破旧立新。老贫农王建基是一个有名的歌手，十多年来，在党的关怀下，在旧套子中增加了不少新的内容，深受群众欢迎。团支部和“文化室”就发动青年人向王建基学习，配合中心任务，编唱新山歌锣鼓。一九六四年，我们编的《战三秋》，表扬了在三秋战斗中的好干部、好社员，鼓舞了干部、社员的劳动热情，加快了“三秋”进度。
    但是，社员们不光是要听评书，山歌，还要看戏。我们又义不容辞地承担了这个任务。并且创作了第一个剧本《王老汉办酒席》。
    一九六三年生产大丰收后，队里出现大办酒席、请客送礼的浪费现象。社员马万成嫁女，主张办二十桌酒席，并向男方要斗米斗面。女儿反对，老人偏要包办。正在这个时候，《王老汉办酒席》上演了。它批评了铺张浪费的作风。看了戏后，女婿女儿理直气壮，抓紧时机说服老人，大队长也赶来多方开导，终于把老人的思想打通了，同时也在全队刹住了大办酒席之风。
    第一个剧本发挥了作用以后，更增加了写戏的信心。我们先后创作了歌剧《赶决算》、《公社红四员》、《送弟参军》等等。都受到社员的欢迎。
    大写英雄人物
    评书、诗歌、戏剧，越写英雄人物，英雄人物也越来越多，在英雄人物事迹的鼓舞下，在群众的迫切要求下，我们更不断地大写而特写英雄人物。这种形势的发展，使许多青年都提起笔来，业余作者的队伍不断扩大，并且出现了英雄人物写英雄人物的生动场面。英雄人物笔下的英雄人物，思想最鲜明，感情最充沛，读了振奋人心。新人新事，英雄人物层出不穷，写了一批，又出现了新的一批，怎么也写不完。我们深深感到，我们的时代是伟大的时代，英雄辈出。我们一定要永远写下去，永远唱下去。（附图片）
