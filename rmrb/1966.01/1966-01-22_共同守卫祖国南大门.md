    Jointly Defend the Southern Gate of the Motherland
    Luo Maokun, Instructor of the “Steel Eighth Company,” a South China Sea Outpost Unit of the PLA
    In 1965, our company, along with the Seventh and Ninth Companies that guard the island alongside us, was rated as "Four Good," which was the result of mutual help and learning between the three brotherly companies.
    In 1965, we had already been a "Four Good" company for four consecutive years, while the work of the nearby Seventh Company was not stable enough; the Ninth Company was not rated as “Four Good.” At that time, the leadership repeatedly instructed us to help the brotherly companies, and they also put forward the slogan of "Learning from the Eighth Company." But at that time, our company had a saying: "Don't burn your lips before you even get a taste of the steamed bun." We were afraid of being labeled as arrogant and complacent, so we adopted the approach of helping only if you wanted to learn, and helping as much as you wanted to learn. Later, with the help of the higher authorities, our thinking improved, and we realized that: the three brotherly companies are in the same battalion, and now they jointly guard a single gate; in battle, they defend the same line. The "Steel Eighth Company" alone, even with three heads and six arms, could not complete the task of guarding our southern gate. From then on, we adopted the method of delivering experience to the doorstep of the brotherly companies.
    Initially, some comrades in our company did not have a clear understanding of mutual help and learning. They saw more of their own strengths and did not see the strengths of others. It was difficult to carry out helping and learning activities with this kind of thinking. To help, we must start with combating arrogance. Based on this kind of thinking, we focused on analyzing the areas where the Seventh and Ninth Companies were stronger than us. Generally speaking, the Ninth Company had already made up its mind to turn the tables, which was a most valuable spirit. The Seventh Company also had a lot of experience in political work. By comparing their strengths with ourselves, we found many weak links in our own company. In this way, while helping, we were very enthusiastic about learning their strengths.
    The helping and learning activities naturally brought about the issue of catching up and surpassing, which was another test for our company. After studying the "Red Ninth Company’s" experience in studying Chairman Mao's works, we introduced the "Three Dares" experience of daring to expose ideological problems, daring to use Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror, and daring to struggle repeatedly in practice, to the Seventh and Ninth Companies. When applying this experience, the Ninth Company also combined it with studying the excellent domestic and international situation, good people and deeds inside and outside the company, reading red books, and performing revolutionary dramas. As a result, a large number of good people and deeds quickly emerged, which received the attention of the leadership. At this time, some comrades in our company again had the idea of ​​being afraid of others surpassing themselves. In order to improve everyone's understanding, we continued to study and realized that comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing are the inevitable laws of mass movements in socialist society, and it is a great thing for brotherly companies to catch up with and surpass themselves. The purpose of helping is to let others catch up with and surpass themselves. Therefore, we were determined not to have any selfish thoughts and continue to pave the way for brotherly companies, and put forward the slogan of "helping out and learning back." We invited activists in studying Chairman Mao's works from the Ninth Company to share their experiences with our company, which was of great help to us. In the future, we must maintain an attitude of constantly improving ourselves, so that we can move forward more steadily on the road of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping.

    共同守卫祖国南大门
    解放军某部南海前哨“钢八连”指导员  罗茂坤
    一九六五年，我们连和并肩守岛的七连、九连一起被评上“四好”，这是三个兄弟连队互帮互学的结果。
    一九六五年，我们已经是连续四年的“四好”连队，而附近的七连工作不够稳定；九连没有和“四好”挂上钩。当时，领导一再指示我们要帮助兄弟连队，他们也提出了“学八连”的口号。但那时，我们连有一句话：“不要热馒头没吃着先烧破嘴唇。”生怕骄傲自满的帽子扣到头上，所以采取你愿意学我就帮，你想学多少我就帮多少。后来在上级的帮助下，我们思想有了提高，认识到：三个兄弟连队同在一个营，现在又共同把守一个门，打起仗来共守一条线，光是“钢八连”就是三头六臂也完成不了把守我们南大门的任务。从那以后，我们对兄弟连队就采取了送经上门的办法。
    起初，我们连有的同志对互帮互学认识不清，他们看自己的优点多，看不到别人的优点，带着这种思想是难以进行帮学活动的。要帮，必须从反骄傲开始。在这样的思想基础上，我们着重分析了七连九连比我们强的情况。九连总的看来，已经下定了打翻身仗的决心，这是一种最可贵的精神。七连在政治工作上，也有很多经验。用他们的长处比比自己，我们找到了自己连队许多薄弱环节，这样，在帮的同时，就十分起劲学他们长处了。
    帮学活动自然带来了赶超的问题，这对我们连又是一个考验。我们在学习了“红九连”学毛主席著作经验以后，把敢于揭发思想毛病、敢于用毛主席思想作对照、敢于在实践中反复斗争的“三敢”体会，向七连九连作了介绍。九连在运用这个经验时，还和学习国内外大好形势、连队内外好人好事，读红书，演革命戏结合起来。这样，很快涌现了一大批好人好事，得到了领导的重视。这时，我们连有的同志又产生了怕别人超过自己的思想。为了提高大家的认识，我们继续学习，认识了比学赶帮超是社会主义社会中群众运动的必然规律，兄弟连队赶上并超过自己是大好事，帮的目的，就是让别人赶上和超过自己。因此，下决心不带一点私心杂念，继续为兄弟连队开路，并提出了“帮出去，学回来”的口号，请九连学习毛主席著作积极分子来我们连谈经验，对我们帮助很大。今后，我们一定保持不断提高自己的态度，使我们在比学赶帮的道路上，更踏实的前进。
