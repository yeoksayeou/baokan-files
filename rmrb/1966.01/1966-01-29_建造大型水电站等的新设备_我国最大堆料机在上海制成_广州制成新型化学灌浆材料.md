    New Equipment for Building Large Hydropower Stations, etc.
    China's Largest Stacker Made in Shanghai
    New Chemical Grouting Material Made in Guangzhou
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th) A large luffing stacker was recently successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Hydraulic Machinery Factory of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. This is currently China's largest stacker. It can stack 500 cubic meters of sand, gravel, or other bulk materials per hour, enough to fill 33 railway cars.
    This large stacker is urgently needed for the construction of large hydropower stations and other projects. Compared with the existing domestic double-cantilever stackers, it has many advantages. It has a large, 26-meter-long luffing arm that can rotate up and down, left and right, and can stack materials as high as a four-story building within 30 meters on both sides of the machine body. As the material continues to pile up, the luffing arm can adjust its height.
    Its structure is relatively novel. The pitch and rotation of the luffing arm adopt hydraulic transmission, which has a simple mechanism and stable operation; the electrical control system is reliable and safe. The entire machine requires only one worker to operate, and its work efficiency is equivalent to that of more than a thousand workers.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th) A new type of chemical grouting material has recently been successfully trial-produced in Guangzhou and has been officially put into production.
    The new chemical grouting material is made of acrylamide and a cross-linking agent. After adding an initiator, it is injected into the area that needs to be treated, forming a water-insoluble rigid gel, which blocks water and reinforces the formation. Its greatest advantage is its low viscosity and good permeability; it can penetrate anywhere water can, and it can solidify in as little as a few seconds. When excavating tunnels, if encountering leaks or gushing water, it is difficult to block the water with ordinary cement. Injecting this new type of grouting material can immediately stop the flow of water. Its solidification time can also be controlled from a few seconds to a few hours as needed, making it a relatively ideal grouting material.

    建造大型水电站等的新设备
    我国最大堆料机在上海制成
    广州制成新型化学灌浆材料
    据新华社上海二十七日电　一种大型摇臂堆料机最近在水利电力部上海水工机械厂试制成功。这是我国目前最大的堆料机。它每小时能堆放五百立方米的砂石或其它散装物料，可以装满三十三节火车车皮。
    这种大型堆料机是建造大型水电站等工程所迫切需要的设备。它同国内现有的双悬臂式堆料机比较，有很多优点。它有一条长二十六米的大摇臂，能上下左右回转，可以在离机身两侧三十米的范围内把物料堆得比一般四层楼房还要高。随着物料不断堆高，摇臂可以调节高度。
    它的结构比较新颖，摇臂的俯仰及回转都采用液压传动，机构简单，运转平稳；电气控制系统可靠、安全。整台机器只要一个工人操作，工作起来能抵得上一千多工人。
    据新华社广州二十六日电　一种新型化学灌浆材料最近在广州试制成功，已正式投入生产。
    新的化学灌浆材料是由丙烯酰胺和一种交联剂配合而成的。它加进一种引发剂之后，注入需要处理的地方，能形成不溶于水的硬性凝胶，起到堵水和加固地层的作用。它的最大优点是粘度低，渗透性好，凡是水能进去的地方它都能钻进去，最快的几秒钟就可以凝固。开挖隧道时，如遇上漏水或涌水，用普通水泥很难把水堵住时，灌入这种新型灌浆材料后，立刻就能截止流水。它的凝固时间还可以任凭需要被控制在几秒钟到几小时内，是目前比较理想的一种灌浆材料。
