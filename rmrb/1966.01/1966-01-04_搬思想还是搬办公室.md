    Moving Ideologies or Moving Offices

    Our county has undergone significant changes since the Socialist Education Movement. Regarding the county party committee leadership, they now understand the need to consider the grassroots more and to act based on the interests of the majority of the people when considering issues and handling affairs. In the past, due to the county party committee leadership's lack of ambition, they were content with the stable output in front of them, didn't seek advancement, cadres floated above, spoke empty words, "ran errands," and work couldn't be implemented at the grassroots level. Was it alright for the county party committee not to face the grassroots? Was it alright to stay above and speak empty words? Should all work be taken to the grassroots for testing? After a debate, everyone reached a consensus that to change the face of Chen County, it was necessary to face the grassroots. Subsequently, the county dispatched ninety cadres to squat in the fields for a long time and moved the county party committee office to the production team.
    Moving the county party committee office to the production team, many comrades were determined to "settle down" among the poor and lower-middle peasants. The county party committee seemed to have solved the problem of facing the grassroots. However, the transformation of ideological understanding is not that simple.
    Not long after going to the countryside, everyone had great enthusiasm and was determined not to let the state spend more money, so they built the office themselves. However, we always wanted to make the surrounding environment as beautiful as possible, so we sent people to transport cinder from other places to pave the road. A leading comrade of the provincial party committee was squatting in a nearby production team, he discovered this and promptly pointed out to us that this was an act of being divorced from the masses, and we changed our approach.
    This is a vivid example. Although the matter is small, the significance is profound. This shows that if the county party committee has not thoroughly solved the problem of "serving whom" ideologically, even if the office is moved to the production team, it will still be incompatible with the masses. We want to serve the grassroots and the poor and lower-middle peasants, so why only make a fuss about the office? Isn't this a case of not thoroughly digging out the roots of the bourgeois world outlook!
        Hunan Chen County County Party Committee Secretary Ma Jingbo
    The case raised by the comrades in Chen County is thought-provoking: Why is it said that the realization of the county party committee leadership's revolutionization is first and foremost ideological revolution? This case illustrates the problem well. Without going through arduous ideological struggle, but planning to take shortcuts and solve problems from a formal perspective, is easier to do, but does not actually solve the problem. The county party committee must start with ideological revolutionization.

    搬思想还是搬办公室
    我县在社会主义教育运动以后，有很大的变化。就县委领导来说，现在不论考虑问题和办事，都懂得要多为基层考虑，要从大多数群众利益出发。过去，由于县委领导缺乏雄心壮志，满足于眼前的产量稳定，不求上进，干部浮在上面，说空话，“跑点”，工作不能落实到基层。到底县委不面向基层行不行？停留在上面说空话行不行？一切工作要不要拿到基层去考验？经过一场辩论，大家的认识一致了，要改变郴县的面貌，一定要面向基层。接着县里便抽调了九十个干部去长期蹲点，并且把县委办公室搬到了生产队。
    县委办公室搬到生产队，许多同志都下决心到贫下中农中间“落户”。县委似乎已经解决了面向基层的问题了。其实不然，思想认识的转变，并不是那样简单。
    下乡不久，大家劲头很大，决心不要国家多花钱，自己动手修办公室。但是，我们总想把周围环境尽量修建得美观些，于是派人到别的地方运煤渣来铺路。省委一位领导同志在附近生产队蹲点，他发现了，及时向我们指出这是脱离群众的举动，我们才改变了作法。
    这是一个生动的例子。事情虽然很小，意义却是深远的。这说明如果县委思想上没有彻底解决“为谁服务”的问题，即使把办公室搬到生产队去，也还是和群众格格不入。我们要为基层、为贫下中农服务，为什么尽在办公室上作文章？这不是没有彻底挖掉资产阶级世界观的根子又是什么呢！
        湖南郴县县委书记  马静波
    郴县同志提出的这个事例，发人深思：为什么说实现县委领导革命化首先是思想革命？这个事例很说明问题。不经过思想上的艰苦斗争，而打算走捷径，从形式上去解决问题，做起来比较容易，实际却解决不了问题。县委一定要从思想革命化做起。
