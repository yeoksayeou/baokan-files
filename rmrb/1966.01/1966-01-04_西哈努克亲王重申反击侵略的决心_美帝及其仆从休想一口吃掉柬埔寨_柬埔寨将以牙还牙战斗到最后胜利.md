    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 3rd (Dispatch): According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 3rd, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk stated on the 2nd that Cambodia clearly warns the U.S. imperialists and their Thai lackeys: Cambodia is not afraid of them. He said Cambodia will retaliate against their attacks tooth and nail.
    Prince Sihanouk made these remarks in the village of Patya Srang, Kandal Province. In his speech, he read out the latest report from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, Lieutenant General Lon Nol, regarding the attack by Thai and "Free Khmer" elements on the O Smach outpost in Oddar Meanchey Province, Cambodia, which began on December 30th.
    Prince Sihanouk said: "The American imperialists in Bangkok are very annoyed because they see that their mercenaries are doing nothing or are always suffering heavy losses whenever these mercenaries are released to attack us. These Americans are trying to recoup their losses at O Smach, and the aggression launched by 'Free Khmer' elements under the command of Thai officers and with the participation of U.S.-made Thai aircraft at O Smach was a large-scale military operation."
    He pointed out: "Washington has authorized its military officials in South Vietnam to attack Cambodia when necessary, so we are not surprised that O Smach has been invaded; this is the starting point of the invasion."
      "I want to make it clear again to the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys that our country is determined to maintain its peace and will always avoid provoking a war. However, this does not mean that we will sit idly by while our territory is being attacked. We will retaliate against every such attack, we will fight tooth and nail, because we are determined to defend our honor."
    He said: "I want to warn the Thais that if attacks like the one on O Smach continue, I will not hesitate to order retaliation in kind, attacking one or more border outposts on Thai territory. If Bangkok arrogantly and openly attacks our territory (I repeat, in our opinion, the 'Free Khmer' elements are the United States plus Thailand), then I see no reason why we cannot exercise the right to retaliate and defend ourselves. As for the possible consequences of our counterattack, the Thai people alone must bear full responsibility for these consequences."
    He further said: "We now and in the future possess all the necessary material means to deal with them and defeat them. We know that the Americans are in a very bad situation in South Vietnam, and the Thai Patriotic Front, which represents the just aspirations of the Thai people, has caused the corrupt regime in Bangkok great concern. We know that China will not hesitate to provide us with all the material assistance we need. China has made this clear to us many times."
    He pointed out that Cambodia could mobilize at least 1.5 million people for war if necessary. He said: "We will need more munitions, and our Chinese brothers will supply us with everything we need."
    He said: "The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not imagine that they can swallow Cambodia in one bite. We now warn them: once war is declared, no matter what situation we may encounter, we will go to the end, and we are confident that we will win the final victory."

    西哈努克亲王重申反击侵略的决心
    美帝及其仆从休想一口吃掉柬埔寨  柬埔寨将以牙还牙战斗到最后胜利
    新华社金边三日电　据柬埔寨新闻社三日报道：柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二日发表讲话说，柬埔寨清楚地正告美帝国主义者和他们的泰国仆从：柬埔寨不怕他们。他说，柬埔寨将以牙还牙地反击他们的进攻。
    西哈努克亲王是在干丹省帕特亚斯朗村发表这次讲话的。他在讲话中宣读了副首相兼国防大臣朗诺中将关于泰国和“自由高棉”分子从十二月三十日开始进攻柬埔寨奥多棉藏省的奥斯马哨所的最新报告。
    西哈努克亲王说：“在曼谷的美国帝国主义者十分恼怒，因为他们看到他们的雇佣军毫无作为或者每当把这些雇佣军放出来进攻我们时总是遭到惨重的损失。这些美国人企图在奥斯马捞回一把，在泰国军官指挥下和有美制泰国飞机参加的‘自由高棉’分子在奥斯马发动的侵略是一次大规模的军事行动。”
    他指出：“华盛顿授权它在南越的军事负责人在必要时进攻柬埔寨，所以我们对奥斯马遭到侵略一事并不感到惊讶，这是侵略的起点。”
      “我要再次向美帝国主义者及其仆从说明白，我国坚决要维护自己的和平，将始终避免挑起一场战争。但是，这并不是说我们会对我国领土遭受的进攻听之任之。我们将对每次这样的进攻予以反击，我们将以牙还牙，因为我们坚决维护我国的荣誉。”
    他说：“我要正告泰国人，如果象进攻奥斯马那样的进攻继续下去，我将毫不犹豫地下令以其人之道还治其人之身，进攻泰国领土上的一个或者几个边境哨所。如果曼谷狂妄地公开进攻我国领土（我再说一遍，在我们看来，“自由高棉”分子就是美国加泰国），那我就看不出为什么我们不能行使权利加以回敬而进行正当防卫。至于我们反击后所可能产生的后果，那只能由泰国人来承担这种后果的全部责任。”
    他又说：“我们现在和将来都拥有一切必要的物质手段来对付他们和打败他们。我们知道，美国人在南越处境十分不妙，代表泰国人民正当愿望的泰国爱国阵线已使曼谷的腐败政权忧虑重重。我们知道，中国将毫不犹豫地给予我们所需要的一切物质援助。中国已经多次向我们作了明确的表示。”
    他指出，柬埔寨在必要时，至少可以动员一百五十万人投入战争。他说：“我们将需要更多的军火，我们的中国兄弟将供给我们所需要的一切军火。”
    他说：“美帝国主义者及其仆从切勿自以为可以一口吃掉柬埔寨。我们现在正告他们：一旦宣战，不管我们可能遇到什么情况，我们将干到底，并且我们确信将赢得最后胜利。”
