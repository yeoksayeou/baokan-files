    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in order to ensure that our party and country do not change color, we not only need correct lines and policies, but also need to cultivate and create millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. —Excerpt from the Nine Commentaries on the Open Letter of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    Implementing Chairman Mao's Instruction on Cultivating Successors to the Proletarian Revolutionary Cause
    The PLA Actively Selects Outstanding Young Cadres for Responsible Positions
    These young cadres are full of vigor and drive, taking it as their primary task to inherit and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and are leading soldiers with high spirits to emphasize politics and strengthen the revolutionary and modern construction of the army.
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. In recent years, all units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and have cultivated and promoted a large number of young cadres to take on leadership roles in grassroots units. These new forces are full of vigor and drive, and are leading soldiers with high spirits to emphasize politics and strengthen the revolutionary and modern construction of the army.
    These young cadres are both virtuous and talented, young and promising. Most of them are the children of workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants, and some are outstanding young people from other laboring classes who have consistently performed well. They grew up in the army's surging movement to create "four-good" companies by holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They were selected according to Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating and creating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The vast majority of them have undergone the tempering of soldier life, are active in studying Chairman Mao's works, are Lei Feng and Wang Jie-style five-good soldiers, are ideologically red and have a tough work style, and can see clearly, stand firmly, and maintain a firm position in the domestic and international class struggle.
    After these young cadres took on leadership positions, they studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times, and armed commanders and fighters with Mao Zedong Thought in all aspects, taking it as their primary task to inherit and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. In the Red Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region, all the company and platoon cadres are new. The current company commander, Yuan Xile, and political instructor, Hu Yuanda, are both twenty-five years old. Both of them enlisted as soldiers after the implementation of the compulsory military service system. After they took on the position of company cadres, they maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of the Red Ninth Company of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and always paid attention to building the company with Mao Zedong Thought. Whether giving a Party lesson, making a mobilization, teaching an action, or dealing with a problem, they used Mao Zedong's stand, viewpoint, and method to improve the political consciousness of the soldiers, making the company's work better and better. Last year, it was rated as a "four-good" company for the fifth time. At a political work conference of companies held in the military region not long ago, the Ninth Company Party Branch introduced its experience of "rooting Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of Party members," and brother companies praised them, saying: "This group of new cadres in the Ninth Company has blazed a new path, creating new experiences. The old foundation has innovated the industry, and the old tradition has blossomed new flowers." Feng Fusheng, an outstanding activist in studying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, was promoted from cook squad leader to political instructor of the supply section of a certain unit last year. He worked even harder to read Chairman Mao's books, promote Mao Zedong Thought, and used Chairman Mao's works as basic teaching materials to reform political classes. He repeatedly gave four political lessons, focusing on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, aiming at the living thoughts of the cooks, which deeply educated everyone. Because they were armed ideologically, the positive factors of the people were mobilized, and the work became better and better. The number of five-good employees, five-good soldiers, and five-good canteens greatly increased.
    In various tasks, a large number of newly promoted cadres have inherited the glorious tradition of the people's army's political leadership over military affairs, and military command, followed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao on emphasizing politics, and put politics in the first place of all work, using politics to lead technology, and ideology to lead business. When arranging work, they first arrange political and ideological work; when analyzing the situation, they first analyze the political and ideological situation; when checking and summarizing work, they first check and summarize political and ideological work. Jia Guigui, the newly promoted deputy political instructor of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, when leading a military training task, had a tight schedule and a heavy task. Some people suggested working overtime to intensify practice. At that time, the company commander and political instructor were not present, but he resolutely rejected this approach, and first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the situation of class struggle at home and abroad, and ideologically improved everyone's consciousness of why they were training and for whom they were training. Then he mobilized the masses to set off an upsurge of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, and helping each other, and as a result, the task was completed quickly and well. Jiang Xiaolian, a young political instructor newly promoted in a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, has also been praised for his ability to correctly handle the relationship between politics and technology. The telephone squad had poor training results. Instead of first helping this squad find technical reasons, he moved his luggage to the squad and ate, slept, and operated with the soldiers to find ideological reasons and solve ideological problems. When an accident occurred in the motor vehicle driver squad, he did not first dwell on technical issues, but moved into the squad, wiped cars and drove with the drivers, using Chairman Mao's books to educate the drivers to firmly establish the idea of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world. Then he studied with everyone, and formulated preventive measures to address the causes of the accident. As a result, these two squads became advanced units, and the driver squad became a red banner of safe driving in the entire division.
    The newly promoted cadres have changed their positions and status, but the true qualities of an ordinary soldier have not changed. They have taken the old cadres as examples in all aspects, maintaining and carrying forward the glorious traditions of the people's army of hard struggle, unity between officers and soldiers, and unity between superiors and subordinates, and have achieved the following: the idea of serving the people remains unchanged, the true qualities of an ordinary soldier remain unchanged, and the style of hard work and simplicity remains unchanged. The new cadres of the guard company of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region are like soldiers in all aspects after their promotion, and their lives are simple and hard. None of them has added good clothes or bought good bedding. Da Zhaxi, the deputy political instructor of the Second Company of a certain unit on the Tibetan plateau, has been sleeping with the soldiers in a shared bunk for a long time after becoming a cadre, and cares about the hardships of the soldiers in all aspects. When the soldiers are sick, he personally pours water and feeds them, and has become the confidant of the soldiers. These new cadres have not only maintained the true qualities of ordinary soldiers in their ideological feelings and lifestyle, but also set an example in their work, taking the lead in everything. Wen Shicheng, a soldier of a certain unit, always picked the heavy burden to bear after being promoted to a cadre. A strong typhoon broke the telephone line, and the leading organs lost contact with the island across the street. He stepped forward, rowed a small boat, braved the violent winds and waves, and completed the task of communication and liaison. In another wire check, he set off with the soldiers against the wind. Climbing telephone poles to check the lines is very dangerous, and he always went up first. The typhoon blew him off the telephone pole and into the mud. His clothes were torn and he bled. For the safety of the soldiers, he still did not say a word and continued to climb. Everyone said that he was the first to endure hardship and the last to enjoy, and was the one who cared most about the hardships of the soldiers.
    In the sea battles, air battles, and border defense struggles of recent years, these young cadres have also inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions and excellent fighting styles of the people's army. In their command positions, they are as brave and resourceful as the old cadres who participated in the revolutionary war, and command effectively. Dong Xiaohai, the squadron leader of the "Heroic Aviation Squadron" of a certain air force unit, was still a young boy wearing a red scarf in the early days of liberation, and now he is an air commander with both political consciousness and certain military qualities. After he was promoted to squadron leader, he studied and applied Chairman Mao's works even more creatively, and applied Chairman Mao's strategic thinking to air combat, fighting bravely and fiercely, commanding with intelligence and decisiveness. No matter how cunning the enemy is, they cannot escape the fate of being annihilated. He and his comrades-in-arms have created brilliant achievements in the battle to defend the motherland's airspace. Not long ago, in the battle to severely attack the US-Chiang Kai-shek warships east of Chongwu, Fujian, the young boat captain Ma Xian'gao, who had not been in office for long, successfully completed the command mission. Before the attack, he held a mobilization meeting and, together with the political instructor, organized all the sailors to study Chairman Mao's works and made combat mobilization. As soon as he received the attack order, he commanded the warship and his brother warships to go straight to the war zone. The enemy ships hurriedly fired their guns, trying to stop our ships from advancing. Ma Xian'gao stood proudly on the command platform and loudly ordered: "Accelerate!" The shells fired by the enemy ships exploded around our ships from time to time. He was calm and decisive, and with the spirit of "bayonet to bayonet", he commanded the warships to approach the enemy ships directly. When he approached the enemy ship, he issued the order to "Fight!" and, together with his brother warships, launched a fierce attack and sank the enemy ship. Throughout the battle, he was heroic and tenacious, and commanded effectively, and therefore won a second-class merit.
    Boldly cultivating and selecting young cadres is a glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army. Since the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission in 1960, the party committees of all units have attached great importance to selecting grassroots cadres from outstanding soldiers in accordance with the instructions of the Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin Biao. In 1964, Chairman Mao issued the great call for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and the entire army was deeply educated and greatly encouraged. The party committees at all levels immediately included the cultivation of revolutionary successors on the important agenda, repeatedly organized cadres to study the five conditions for cultivating successors, and constantly summarized experience and formulated effective plans and measures. In order to cultivate more and better revolutionary successors and grassroots cadres, the company party branch continuously armed the minds of young soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, and actively discovered talent, looked for "seedlings", and carefully cultivated them in the excellent situation of holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and striving to create "four-good" companies and "five-good" soldiers. In the selection process, party organizations at all levels implemented the mass line and adhered to the procedure of "branch nomination, mass evaluation, party committee review, and superior approval." In grasping the conditions and standards, all units attached importance to implementing the class line, paying attention both to class composition, so that workers, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants would occupy an advantage in the cadre ranks, and to "focusing on performance," and not engaging in a theory of class composition as the sole determinant.
    At present, all units are summing up experience and are determined to better respond to Chairman Mao's call for cultivating revolutionary successors and implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's recent instruction: boldly promote truly outstanding commanders and fighters to key responsible positions.

    毛泽东同志提出，为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。　——摘自九评苏共中央的公开信
    贯彻毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示
    解放军积极选拔优秀青年干部到负责岗位
    这些青年干部朝气勃勃，干劲十足，把接好毛泽东思想和传好毛泽东思想作为自己的首要任务，正在意气风发地带领战士突出政治，加强部队的革命化、现代化建设
    新华社十六日讯　最近几年，中国人民解放军各部队坚决执行毛主席提出培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示，培养和提拔了大批青年干部在基层单位担任领导工作。这些新生力量朝气勃勃，干劲十足，正在意气风发地带领着战士突出政治，加强部队的革命化、现代化建设。
    这些青年干部德才兼备，年轻有为，大部分是工人和贫农下中农的子弟，也有一些是一贯表现好的其它劳动阶级出身的优秀青年。他们是在全军高举毛泽东思想红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，风起云涌地创造四好连队运动中成长起来的；是根据毛主席关于培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示选拔出来的。他们中的绝大多数人，经过了士兵生活的锻炼，是学习毛主席著作的积极分子，雷锋、王杰式的五好战士，思想红、作风硬，在国内外阶级斗争中看得清，站得稳，立场坚定。
    这些青年干部到了领导岗位以后，更加刻苦学习毛主席著作，时时按毛主席的指示办事，处处用毛泽东思想武装指战员的头脑，把接好毛泽东思想、传好毛泽东思想作为自己的首要任务。沈阳部队某部红九连，连排干部全是新的。现任连长袁西乐、指导员胡远达，都是二十五岁。他们两人都是实行义务兵役制以后入伍的战士。他们担任了连队干部以后，保持和发扬了红九连活学活用毛主席著作的光荣传统，时刻注意用毛泽东思想建设连队，不论上一次党课，作一次动员，教一个动作，处理一个问题，都以毛主席的立场、观点、方法来提高战士们的政治觉悟，使连队工作做得好上加好，去年第五次被评为四好连队。不久前在军里召开的连队政治工作会议上，九连党支部介绍了“使毛泽东思想在党员头脑里扎根”的经验，兄弟连队称赞说：“九连这一批新干部，闯出了新经验，真是老基础创新业，老传统又开了新花。”全军突出的学习毛主席著作积极分子丰福生，去年由炊事班长提拔为某部给养科政治指导员以后，更加努力读毛主席的书，宣传毛泽东思想，并以毛主席著作为基本教材，改革政治课。他针对着炊事员的活思想，连续上了四堂政治课，反复讲“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，使大家受到深刻教育。由于思想上武装起来了，人的积极因素调动起来了，工作就越做越好了，五好职工、五好战士、五好食堂大大增加。
    在各项工作中，大批新提拔起来的干部，都继承了人民军队政治领导军事、统帅军事的光荣传统，遵循着林彪副主席提出的突出政治的指示，把政治摆在一切工作的首位，以政治带技术，以思想带业务。他们在安排工作时，首先安排政治思想工作；分析形势时，首先分析政治思想形势；检查和总结工作时，又是先检查和总结政治思想工作。北京部队某部新提升的副指导员贾桂贵在领导一项军事训练时，时间紧，任务重，有人提出加班加点加紧练习。当时，连长、指导员不在，他坚决拒绝了这种做法，首先组织大家学习毛主席著作，学习国内外阶级斗争形势，从思想上提高大家为谁练兵、为什么练兵的自觉性，然后发动群众掀起比学赶帮超的热潮，结果这项任务完成得又快又好。广州部队某部新提拔的年轻的指导员江孝连，由于善于正确处理政治与技术关系也受到人们的赞扬。电话班训练成绩不好，他不是先帮助这个班找技术原因，而是搬着行李到班里，与战士同吃、同睡、同操作，找思想原因，解决思想问题。汽车司机班发生了事故，他也不是先从技术上打转转，而是先住到班里，同司机们一起擦车、出车，用毛主席的书教育司机，牢固树立为中国人民、世界人民服务的思想，然后和大家一起研究，针对发生事故的原因订出预防措施。结果这两个班都成了先进单位，司机班还成为全师安全行车的一面红旗。
    新提升的干部，职务变了，地位变了，但普通一兵的本色没变，他们处处以老干部为榜样，保持和发扬人民军队艰苦奋斗、官兵一致、上下一致的光荣传统，作到了：为人民服务的思想不变，普通一兵的本色不变，艰苦朴素的作风不变。新疆军区某部警卫连的新干部，提升以后处处象战士一样，生活上艰苦朴素，他们之中没有一个人添好衣服，买好被褥。西藏高原某部二连副指导员大扎西，当了干部以后，长期和战士一起睡统铺，处处关心战士的疾苦，战士病了，亲自端水喂饭，成了战士的知心人。这些新干部不仅思想感情、生活作风上保持了普通一兵的本色，工作中也处处以身作则，身先士卒。某部战士文世成提升为干部后，无论什么工作总是拣重担子挑。强台风刮断了电话线，领导机关与对面小岛失掉了联系，他挺身而出，划着小船，冒狂风巨浪，完成了通信联络的任务。在另
  一次查线时，他带着战士迎风出发。查线爬电线杆很危险，他都是自己先上去。台风把他从电线杆上吹下来，跌入烂泥中，衣服破了，身上出了血，他为了战士的安全，仍然一声不吭，继续攀登。大家说他是吃苦在先、享受在后，最能关心战士疾苦的人。
    在最近几年的海战、空战和边防斗争中，这些青年干部也继承和发扬了人民军队的光荣传统和优良的战斗作风，他们在指挥位置上，象参加过革命战争的老干部一样，勇敢机智，指挥有方。空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”中队长董小海，解放初期，还是个戴红领巾的少年，现在已经是一位既有政治觉悟又有一定军事素养的空中指挥员。他提升为中队长以后，更加活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的战略思想运用到空战中去，打得勇敢泼辣，指挥机智果断，不管敌人多狡猾，都逃不脱被歼的命运，他和他的战友在保卫祖国领空的战斗中，创造了光辉的战绩。不久前，在福建崇武以东海面痛击美蒋军舰的战斗中，任职不久的青年艇长马宪诰，出色地完成了指挥任务。他在出击前，开誓师大会，和指导员一起组织全体水兵学习毛主席著作，作战斗动员。一接到出击命令，他就指挥战艇和兄弟艇一起直奔战区。敌舰慌忙打炮，妄图阻止我艇前进。马宪诰昂然挺立在指挥台上，大声命令：“加速！”敌舰打来的炮弹不时在我艇周围爆炸，他沉着果敢，以“刺刀见红”的精神，指挥战艇直逼敌舰。当逼近敌舰时，他发出“打！”的命令，和兄弟艇一起，一阵猛打，把敌舰打沉。在整个战斗中，他英勇顽强，指挥有力，因此荣立二等战功。
    大胆培养选拔青年干部是人民解放军的光荣传统。一九六○年军委扩大会议以来，各部队党委根据军委和林彪副主席的指示十分重视从优秀战士中选拔基层干部。一九六四年，毛主席发出培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的伟大号召，全军上下受到深刻的教育，得到极大的鼓舞。各级党委立即把培养革命接班人列入重要议事日程，反复组织干部学习培养接班人五个条件，不断总结经验，订出行之有效的计划措施。连队党支部为了培养出更多更好的革命接班人和基层干部，在高举毛泽东思想红旗，突出政治，争创四好连队、五好战士的大好形势下，不断用毛泽东思想武装青年战士的头脑，并在各项工作中积极发现人材、物色“苗子”，精心培养。在选拔时，各级党组织贯彻了群众路线，坚持了“支部提名、群众评议、党委审查、上级批准”的程序。在掌握条件标准上，各单位重视贯彻阶级路线，既注意阶级成分，使工人、贫农下中农在干部队伍中占优势，又“重在表现”，不搞唯成分论。
    目前，各单位正在总结经验，决心更好地响应毛主席培养革命接班人的号召，贯彻林彪副主席最近指示的：大胆提拔真正优秀的指战员到关键性的负责岗位。
