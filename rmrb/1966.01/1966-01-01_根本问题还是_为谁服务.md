    The Fundamental Issue is Still "Serving Whom?"
    After reading the article "The Crux of the Matter is Not Here," I have a different view.
    What we mean by serving the people is serving the working class and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. First, we must understand their wishes and demands. What are the current demands of the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants? They demand that the Party continue to lead them in carrying out the class struggle in urban and rural areas, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and develop production more quickly. This is where the fundamental interests of the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants lie. However, some leading cadres have neglected class struggle. Can it be said that the issue of "serving whom?" has already been resolved?
    Some problems appear to be problems of work methods, but in essence, they are problems of thought, problems of "serving whom?" For example, some comrades do not go to the grassroots to conduct investigation and research, but get bogged down in general leadership of holding meetings, assigning work, reading documents, and listening to reports. As a result, it is difficult to be accountable to the people and also difficult to be accountable to the Party's leading organs. Therefore, I believe that the issue of "serving whom?" still needs to be further resolved among veteran revolutionary comrades. It is even more important for young comrades who joined the work after liberation.
    Knowing that one should serve the people is one thing, but firmly establishing the concept of serving the people in one's mind and putting it into action is another. There is still a considerable distance between the two, and it will require a long and even painful ideological struggle to narrow this distance. If the county committee leaders only solve the problem of "how to serve" without deeply studying and discussing the fundamental question of "serving whom?" there will be no results. Therefore, I think that to realize the revolutionization of the county committee leadership, the most fundamental issue is still the issue of "serving whom?".

    根本问题还是“为谁服务”
    读了《症结不在这儿》一文后，我有不同的看法。
    我们所说的为人民服务，就是为工人阶级和广大的贫农下中农服务，首先必须了解他们的愿望与要求。当前工人、贫农下中农的要求是什么呢？他们要求党继续领导他们开展城乡的阶级斗争，把社会主义革命进行到底，更快发展生产。这是工人、贫农下中农的根本利益所在。然而有些领导干部忽视了阶级斗争，这能说“为谁服务”的问题已经解决了吗？
    有些问题看来是工作方法问题，实质则是思想问题，是“为谁服务”的问题。例如，有些同志不深入基层调查研究，而陷入开会、布置工作、看文件、听汇报的一般领导，这样做的结果，既难向人民负责，也难向党的领导机关负责。因此，我认为“为谁服务”的问题，在老革命同志当中也还有待继续解决。对解放后参加工作的青年同志就更为重要了。
    知道为人民服务是一回事，确实在头脑中牢固地树立起为人民服务的观念，并见之于行动，则是另一回事。二者还有一个相当大的距离，要缩小这个距离，还需要长期的甚至是痛苦的思想斗争。如果县委领导只去解决“怎样服务”的问题，而不深入地研究讨论“为谁服务”这样一个带有根本性的问题，那就不会有什么结果。所以，我觉得要实现县委领导革命化，最根本的问题还是“为谁服务”的问题。
