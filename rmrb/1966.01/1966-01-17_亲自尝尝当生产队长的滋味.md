Title: Personally Experience the Taste of Being a Production Team Leader

    The rural brigade party branch and production team are grassroots units for implementing the Party's policies. The branch secretary and production team leader have the deepest experience in how to concretize the Party's policies. County committee leaders must go to the front line to personally experience the "taste" of being a team leader in order to be more revolutionary and better serve the masses. Comrades who often work in rural areas understand that a cadre may be able to do a good job in leading the county committee, but they may not necessarily be able to be a good brigade party branch secretary or production team leader. Why? Because some county committee leaders are often at the top and do not have deep experience in the work of the grassroots team leaders, or they have some experience but are not necessarily as thoughtful as the production team leaders. Some often go down to the countryside, but only stay for a few days in a perfunctory manner, taking a material and leaving. Such materials are sometimes very one-sided, and relying on "it" to guide work is very unfavorable.

    The Jianping County Committee has already streamlined administration and organized more than 140 cadres with rural work experience to go to the countryside to stay at designated points, taking an important step towards realizing the revolutionization of the county committee. We hope that more county committees will do the same.

    亲自尝尝当生产队长的滋味
    农村大队党支部和生产队是执行党的方针政策的基层单位。支部书记、生产队长对党的方针政策怎样具体化体验最深。县委领导要更好地革命化，更好地为群众服务，必须亲自到第一线去尝尝当队长的“滋味”。常在农村工作的同志都体会到：一个干部如果他能做好县委领导工作，但他不一定能当好一个大队党支部书记或生产队长。为什么？因为有些县委领导同志常在上边，对基层的队长工作体验不深，或者有所体验但不一定能象生产队长那样想的周到。有的虽然常下去，但是走马观花的呆几天，拿一份材料就走了。这样的材料有时很片面，靠“它”指导工作是很不利的。
    建平县委已经精兵简政，组织了一百四十多名有农村工作经验的干部下乡蹲点，为实现县委革命化迈出了重要的一步。我们希望能有更多的县委这样做。
