    Eyes must look downward. This is what we often call following the mass line. Whether or not we rely on the people, whether or not we maintain the closest ties with the broad masses of the people, and whether or not we sincerely listen to the voices of the masses—these are the prominent features that distinguish us from any other political party. Comrade Wang Ziqiang uses his personal experience to illustrate that only by looking downward can we find solutions and overcome difficulties in our work.

    Looking back on my work over the years, I have a superficial view: in any work, as long as we look downward, go deep among the masses, integrate our thoughts and feelings with the masses, and combine the Party's policies with the actual situation, the work will be smooth and the results will be good.

    For example, how exactly should we carry out water conservancy construction? The way is to look downward and investigate among the masses. The experience of Xiangcun Brigade of Huagu Commune in constructing water conservancy has greatly inspired us. The Houchong production team of this brigade has 118 mu of fields, distributed in a mountain valley. Originally, there were no reservoirs and they all "depended on the heavens." They chose Wangjia Dachong, which had a long waterway, a narrow gorge entrance, a solid dam foundation, high water capacity, and low seepage, and built a small reservoir, using only fifteen full and half laborers, and completed it in twenty-seven days. That year, the project benefited more than 300 mu. Like this experience of "blocking a dam in the valley between two mountains," in Guangde, a place with many mountains and valleys, many communes and production teams can do it themselves. In the past, our water conservancy was like "eating a radish by peeling it, peeling one section at a time." Wherever there was drought, we dug ponds and built dams; wherever there was a threat of floods, we built dikes to prevent floods. We were doing things piecemeal, without any overall plan. After studying the experience of Xiangcun, we saw that the speed of water conservancy construction in the entire county could be greatly accelerated. Therefore, we conducted a general survey of the water conservancy situation in the county and made a plan. Through the survey and planning, our understanding has been improved a step further, clarifying that mountain and water management must be comprehensively considered, and water management must start with mountain management. It was also clarified that water management should focus on storage, small-scale projects, projects that benefit the current year, projects run by the commune, and a combination of backbone projects and general small-scale agricultural water projects. It can be seen that looking downward and learning from the masses is fully in line with the Party Central Committee's water management policy.

    For example, Guangde County has insufficient fertilizer, and in the past, nearly 50% of the paddy fields were transplanted with seedlings into plain water. How to solve the fertilizer problem? There are two ways: one is to look upward and wait for state support; the other is to look downward and find our own way. Our experience is that looking downward is the correct way to solve the problem.

    There are four ways to solve the fertilizer problem: raising, planting, accumulating, and manufacturing. Which one should we focus on? We went among the masses, carefully analyzed the survey materials, and believed that planting green manure, red clover, was a better way to solve the fertilizer problem. However, at that time, some people had three fears about planting red clover seeds: first, fear of large investment affecting distribution; second, fear that the soil was too poor to grow; third, fear that too much planting would overwork people and livestock. The key to solving these problems still lies in looking downward and going deep into the masses to resolve ideological obstacles. As a result, this work was carried out smoothly. The county has planted 265,000 mu of red clover, and the masses have raised more than 90% of the funds themselves. These red clover plantings, plus other green manure and planned spring-sown red clover seeds, calculated at one mu guaranteeing one mu, can solve the base fertilizer problem for 73% of the county's paddy fields. These examples can all prove that looking downward allows us to dare to struggle, dare to lead boldly, and not be timid and hesitant.

    Have we established the thinking style of looking downward and relying on the masses in all our work? Obviously, we are still far from it. We have only begun to have this understanding from the work we have done.

    眼睛要向下
    眼睛向下，也就是我们常说的走群众路线。是不是依靠人民群众？是不是同广大人民群众取得最密切的联系？是不是真心诚意地听取群众的话？这是我们区别于任何其他政党的一个显著标志。王自强同志以自己亲身经验说明，只有眼睛向下，我们才能在工作中找到办法，克服困难。
    ——编者
    回顾这些年的工作，我有一个肤浅的看法：无论什么工作，凡是眼睛向下，深入群众，思想感情和群众打成一片，使党的方针政策和实际情况结合起来，工作就顺利，效果就好。
    例如，兴修水利究竟应该怎么办？办法是眼睛向下，到群众中去调查。化古公社向村大队兴修水利的经验，对我们有很大启发。这个大队的后冲生产队，一百一十八亩田，分布在一条山冲里面，原来没有一口山塘，都是“靠天收”。他们选择水路长，山口窄，坝基牢实，容水多，不渗漏的汪家大冲，修了一个小水库，只用了十五个整半劳动力，在二十七天内就修成了。这个工程当年受益面积三百多亩。象这样“两山夹一洼，拦冲打个坝”的治水经验，在广德这种山多、冲多的地方，许多公社、生产队都可以自己干。过去我们治水是“吃萝卜剥皮，吃一节剥一节”，那里有旱，就在那里挖塘打坝；那里受洪灾威胁，就在那里筑堤防洪，零打碎敲，胸中无“数”。在研究了向村的经验以后，我们看到全县的水利建设速度，可以大大加快，于是对全县水利情况进行普查，作出规划。通过普查和规划，我们的认识就提高了一步，明确了治山治水必须统筹兼顾，治水必须治山。明确了治水要以蓄为主，小型为主，当年受益为主，社办为主，骨干工程和一般小型农水工程相结合。可见，眼睛向下，从群众中得来的东西，同党中央治水的方针是完全吻合的。
    又如广德县肥料不足，过去每年有近百分之五十的水田都是白水插秧。怎样解决肥料问题？有两种办法：一种是眼睛向上，坐等国家支援；另一种是眼睛向下，自谋出路。我们的经验是眼睛向下，才是解决问题的正确道路。
    解决肥料有养、种、积、制四种办法，究竟着重抓那一种？我们到群众中去，认真分析了调查材料，认为多种绿肥红花草，是解决肥料的较好办法。但是，当时有人对种红花草籽存在着三怕：一怕投资大，影响分配；二怕土瘦长不起来；三怕种多了，人畜忙不开。解决这些问题的关键，仍然在于眼睛向下，深入到群众中去解决思想障碍。结果，这项工作得到顺利展开，全县已种红花草二十六万五千亩，群众自筹资金占百分之九十以上。种的这些红花草，加上其它绿肥和计划春播红花草籽，按一亩保一亩计算，可以解决全县水田面积百分之七十三的基肥问题。这些事例，都可以证明：眼睛向下，才敢于斗争，才敢于大胆领导，不至于畏首畏尾。
    我们是不是在所有的工作上都树立了眼睛向下，依靠群众的思想作风呢？显然还差得很远，我们只是从做过的工作中，开始有了这  点体会。  安徽广德县委书记  王自强
