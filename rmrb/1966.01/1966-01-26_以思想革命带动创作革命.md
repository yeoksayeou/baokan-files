    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The North China Regional 1966 New Year Picture and Print Exhibition, which opened on the 21st at the China Art Gallery in the capital, has met with the broad masses of viewers with its strong revolutionary content, rich themes, and forms popular with the masses. This exhibition reviews the fruitful results achieved by art workers in North China in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism.
    Among the New Year pictures and prints on display, many works express the Chinese people's boundless love for the great Party and the great leader. The Hebei Province New Year picture "Chairman Mao and Young Peasants," Beijing's New Year picture "We Are With Chairman Mao," and "Happy Meeting," express the close relationship between the revolutionary leader and the masses from different angles.
    Many of the works depict heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and major themes in the three great revolutionary movements in North China. Heroic figures such as Dazhai's Chen Yonggui and others, the young Party branch secretary Zhou Mingshan, the famous national advanced producer Shi Chuanxiang, the grassland heroines Long Mei and Yu Rong, and the great communist fighter Wang Jie left a deep impression on the audience. Shanxi Province's print "Striving for Every Drop of Water," "Great Battle of Wolf Nest Slope," and New Year picture "Entrepreneurship Picture," as well as Hebei's Nan Gunlonggou series, Inner Mongolia's Dangpudi series and other works, highlight the heroic spirit of the broad masses of farmers in self-reliance, hard work, and transforming the world. Shanxi's New Year picture "Enlightenment," Hebei's New Year picture series "Double Happiness Cart Makes Revolution," and other works reflect the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers on the industrial front in the movement of comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other. The Beijing Municipality series "Backpack Shop" also expresses the lofty idea of mountain area supply and marketing personnel wholeheartedly serving the people. The Beijing Military Region's print "Three Feet of Ice," Inner Mongolia's print "Unstoppable," and other works highlight the fighting spirit of the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of militiamen in preparing to defeat the American aggressors at any time, embodying Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of people's war.
    Beijing's New Year picture series "Ode to the Vietnamese Tiger-Fighting Heroes" and the print series "Fight, Congo" and the famous Yangliuqing New Year picture series "A Xia" and "Equatorial War Drums" all enthusiastically praise the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the Asian and African people, expressing the Chinese people's determination to fight alongside the Vietnamese brothers and the Asian, African, and Latin American people.
    The historical struggle-themed New Year picture series "Bethune" was well received by the audience.
    Over the past year, the broad masses of art workers in North China have studied Chairman Mao's works, gone deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and many people have personally participated in the socialist education movement and production labor, using ideological revolution to promote creative revolution, and have created many excellent works. What is even more gratifying is that people have seen the rapid growth of the broad masses of worker-peasant-soldier youth amateur art authors. More than one hundred of the works exhibited this time were created by amateur authors.
    This exhibition was jointly organized by the Chinese Artists Association, the branches of the Art Associations of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in North China, and the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    据新华社讯　二十一日在首都中国美术馆开幕的华北区一九六六年年画、版画展览会，以强烈的革命内容、丰富的题材、群众喜闻乐见的形式，同广大观众见面了。这次展览检阅了华北地区美术工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务取得的硕果。
    这次展出的年画、版画中，许多作品表达了我国人民对伟大的党和伟大领袖的无比热爱。河北省年画《毛主席和青年农民》，北京的年画《我们和毛主席在一起》和《幸福的会见》等作品，都从不同角度表现了革命领袖和群众之间的亲密关系。
    作品中，有很多是表现工农兵英雄人物和华北地区三大革命运动中重大题材的。大寨人陈永贵等的英雄群象、年青的党支部书记周明山、著名的全国先进生产者时传祥、草原英雄小姐妹龙梅和玉荣以及伟大共产主义战士王杰等英雄人物，都给观众留下了深刻的印象。山西省版画《滴水必争》、《大战狼窝掌》和年画《创业图》，以及河北的南滚龙沟组画、内蒙古的当铺地组画等作品，突出了广大农民自力更生、艰苦奋斗改天换地的英雄气概。山西的年画《开窍》、河北的年画组画《双喜车闹革命》等，反映了工业战线广大工人在比学赶帮超运动中的革命精神。北京市的组画《背篓商店》也表现了山区供销人员全心全意为人民服务的崇高思想。北京部队的版画《冰冻三尺》、内蒙古的版画《不可阻挡》等作品，突出了广大解放军指战员和广大民兵，准备随时打败美国侵略者的战斗精神，体现了毛主席人民战争的光辉思想。
    北京的年画组画《越南打虎英雄颂》和版画组画《战斗吧，刚果》和著名的杨柳青年画组画《阿霞》、《赤道战鼓》等，都热情歌颂了越南人民和亚非人民的英勇斗争，表达了中国人民决心与越南兄弟和亚非拉人民并肩战斗的意志。
    历史斗争题材的年画组画《白求恩》，受到观众的好评。
    一年来，华北地区广大美术工作者大学毛主席著作，深入工农兵生活，许多人亲身参加了社会主义教育运动，参加了生产劳动，以思想革命带动创作革命，创作出不少优秀的作品。更可喜的是，人们看到了广大工农兵青年业余美术作者正在迅速成长。这次展出的作品中有一百多件是业余作者创作的。
