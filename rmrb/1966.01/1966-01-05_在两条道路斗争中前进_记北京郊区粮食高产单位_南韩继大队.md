    Advancing in the Struggle Between Two Roads
    A Record of the South Hanji Brigade, a High-Yield Grain Unit in the Suburbs of Beijing
    The South Hanji Brigade of Zhoukoudian Commune in Fangshan County, Beijing, has worked hard for eight years, building stable and high-yield farmland on the barren and water-deficient "Dry Highland," and its grain output has steadily increased, becoming a banner for high grain yield in the suburbs of Beijing.
    Last year, the suburbs of Beijing suffered a severe drought, but the brigade's more than 1,100 mu of grain fields still achieved a bumper harvest for the eighth consecutive year, with an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The entire brigade of 183 households and 904 people produced an average of 1,300 jin of grain per person.
    The South Hanji Brigade has been able to achieve bumper harvests year after year because it has a Party branch that resolutely listens to Chairman Mao and conscientiously implements the Party's general line for socialist construction. It leads the members in the struggle between two roads, adheres to the socialist political direction, uses Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, and constantly overcomes capitalist ideology, as well as ideological obstacles such as relying on heaven, clinging to the old ways, and complacency. At the same time, it leads the masses to fight against nature, demand water from the land, boldly innovate, and reform the farming system. In this way, the farmland of South Hanji has gradually become high-yield farmland, and the people of South Hanji have also been trained into a fighting team capable of fighting tough battles.
    South Hanji was originally a poor village known for its dryness and poverty. The village and cultivated land, like a high platform, protruded on the plain southeast of the Dragon Bone Mountain, the hometown of "Peking Man," and the groundwater level was very low. It was often a small drought here when it wasn't dry elsewhere, and a particularly severe drought here when there was a major drought elsewhere. For generations, the farmers of South Hanji have been fighting the "drought demon" on this "Dry Highland," living a life of suffering.
    Since liberation, especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, the struggle of the South Hanji people against drought has achieved one victory after another.
    In eight years, the grain yield per unit area in South Hanji has increased by two times, with an average annual increase of 15 percent. Now many member households have surplus grain, and the collective also has reserve grain. In the past eight years, it has sold more than 2.6 million jin of grain to the state. Setting the Direction
    After liberation, the people of South Hanji, from mutual aid teams to cooperatives, have been searching for a way to get rid of poverty. Which road to take? Different classes have different views. In the autumn of 1957, some people (mostly well-to-do middle peasants) proposed that they should no longer gnaw at this dry sandy land and free up the main labor force to engage in "sideline occupations." Individual cadres also believed that this was a way to quench their thirst. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants did not agree, and shouted loudly: If we do not develop agriculture and only engage in sideline occupations, this road will not work!
    Two diametrically opposed opinions reflected two different roads and two opposite directions. The Party branch promptly reminded everyone: Don't forget the lessons of two years ago. At that time, those who wanted to take the capitalist road were in power and once engaged in speculative trading in the name of engaging in sideline occupations. They made a lot of money that year, but most of it was divided up by a few people who engaged in "sideline occupations." The collective crops were not planted well, and after the autumn, they relied on the state to transfer grain. Poor and lower-middle peasants who were wholeheartedly engaged in farming received less grain and money.
    The facts became clearer and clearer, and the members said: This is the evil path of developing capitalism. We should adhere to the principle of taking grain as the key link and diversifying our operations. If those who grow the land drop their hoes to grab money and reach out to the state for grain, where will the state's grain come from? What will socialism rely on to build?
    Xu Qingwen, the secretary of the Party branch, deeply understood the importance of grain. This "Old Eighth Route" soldier, who had been forced out of his home by the landlord and transferred back to his hometown after being wounded in the army, told everyone about his personal experience: "The revolution needs grain. In those days, the Kuomintang reactionaries blockaded the liberated areas. If we had not opened up wasteland and grown grain ourselves, we would not have been able to defeat the enemy. Now American imperialism is still rampant everywhere. If we farmers prepare sufficient grain for the country, it will be the most powerful counterattack against American imperialism."
    The Party branch also guided the members to recall the two different situations of the two major droughts before and after liberation, making the broad masses of cadres and members even more loving of the new society and understanding the ordinary truth that "grain is the treasure of treasures." They were determined to listen to the Party and put their minds and energy into agriculture, facing difficulties and adhering to the correct path of taking grain as the key link. Fighting Drought
    The direction was clear, but how to overcome drought, the fundamental enemy? Was it to resign oneself to fate, or was it that man can conquer nature? The clash of two ideas unfolded again in South Hanji.
    There were no rivers nearby, and the only way was to dig wells. But as soon as the idea of digging wells was mentioned, some people brought out an old saying that had been passed down in South Hanji for generations: "On the Dry Highland, it is difficult to see water until you reach the Yellow Springs." However, the brigade Party branch believed that society had changed, and what could not be done in the past should be done by cooperative members. Since drinking water wells had been dug in the village, irrigation wells could be dug in the fields.
    In the winter of 1957, a well-digging team with Party members and League members as the backbone was formed. They broke ground in the teeth of the cold wind, and after persisting for more than twenty days, they finally saw drops of spring water seeping out from the stone crevices at the bottom of the well. The well-digging team could not go home for the New Year, and early in the morning, they knocked on the door of the supply and marketing cooperative, bought the first waterwheel in the history of South Hanji, and installed it overnight.
    On the first day of the Lunar New Year, all the old and young people in the village crowded to the well to see the waterwheel watering the fields, just like going to a temple fair.
    In 1960, high-voltage transmission lines were erected in South Hanji, and the members installed electric motors and water pumps, drawing water and watering the fields while digging deeper wells. As the well shafts continued to deepen, ordinary water pumps were no longer able to pump the well water up. Some people suggested using deep well pumps, but after calculating the cost, each one would cost 18,000 yuan, which was too expensive. The cadres and members repeatedly experimented and finally solved the problem of deep well water extraction for only more than 1,000 yuan per well.
    The people of South Hanji have gradually found a way to combat drought by using limited water sources based on the actual situation. From 1957 to 1964, they dug more than 50 wells. Although more than half of them did not yield water or collapsed, they still achieved great results: First, the more than ten successful wells guaranteed water for 95 percent of the village's farmland; second, they largely overcame people's reliance on heaven and established the idea that man can conquer nature; third, they trained a drought-fighting team that dared to fight and was not afraid of difficulties.
    Under the guidance of this forward-looking and constantly revolutionary thinking, the people of South Hanji have withstood drought after drought and achieved one victory after another. Skillful Farming
    With water available on the "Dry Highland," the amount of fertilizer also increased accordingly. By 1962, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu had reached 15,000 jin. With these conditions, the people of South Hanji grew good crops, and grain output steadily increased. However, new tasks were placed before the people of South Hanji: to continue to give play to the active factors of people, to carry out a revolution in the farming system, and to further achieve high yields while striving for stable yields.
    The 1,200 mu of land was limited, and the 180 frost-free days could not be changed. But the wisdom and drive of the people of South Hanji were infinite. They were determined to use all favorable conditions to turn the historical one crop a year into two crops.
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, they learned from the experience of intercropping in other places. When wheat began to turn yellow in early June, corn was planted early between the rows of wheat. By late June, when the golden wheat was harvested, the green corn seedlings had already emerged from the ground, ensuring that the corn had enough growing time before planting wheat in the fall. At the same time, the summer planting labor force could be freed up to devote all their efforts to harvesting.
    However, the autumn harvest season was even more tense. From the time the corn was harvested to the time winter wheat was planted, there were only a dozen days. If there was any delay in plowing the land and delivering fertilizer, either tens of millions of jin of fertilizer would not be transported to the fields, or the planting of wheat would be delayed. In order to solve this acute contradiction, the members pooled their efforts and came up with the idea of "reserving strip land." When planting wheat in the previous year, they would reserve a strip of blank land six or seven meters wide in every two or thirty mu of wheat field. In the spring of the following year, they would plant millet and other crops with earlier maturity periods on this "strip land." By the beginning of September, when the corn had not yet matured, the millet and sorghum had already been harvested. The land was freed up, and the fertilizer needed for planting wheat was transported in first and piled up for use. A few days later, when the corn was harvested, the members could spread the fertilizer from the "strip land" to the fields on both sides, and they could plow the land and plant wheat in a timely manner. In this way, they realized their bold oath of "one mu of land being planted as two mu of land, and one sun being used as two suns."
    The people of South Hanji broke with old habits and boldly reformed the farming system. Their experience of planting two crops a year, both with high yields, pointed out the way for farmers in the suburbs of Beijing to increase the multiple cropping index.

    在两条道路斗争中前进
    记北京郊区粮食高产单位——南韩继大队
    北京市房山县周口店公社南韩继大队，艰苦奋战八年，在瘠薄缺水的“旱高台”上建设了稳产高产农田，粮食产量稳步上升，成为北京郊区粮食高产的一面旗帜。
    去年，北京郊区严重干旱，但是这个大队的一千一百多亩粮田，又夺得连续第八年大丰收，平均亩产量突破了千斤大关。全大队一百八十三户、九百零四口人，平均每人生产粮食一千三百斤。
    南韩继大队能够连年夺得丰收，是因为它有一个坚决听毛主席的话，认真执行党的社会主义建设总路线的党支部。它领导社员在两条道路的斗争中，坚持社会主义的政治方向，用毛泽东思想武装群众，不断克服着资本主义思想，以及靠天、守旧、骄傲自满等思想障碍；同时，领导群众与天斗争，向地要水，大胆创新，改革耕作制度。这样，就使得南韩继的农田，逐步变成高产农田，南韩继人也锻炼成一支能打硬仗的战斗队。
    南韩继原是个干旱、贫困出名的穷村子，村庄和耕地象一座高台一样，突起在“北京猿人”故乡龙骨山东南的平原上，地下水位很低。经常是别处不旱这里小旱，别处大旱这里特旱。南韩继的农民世世代代就是在这块“旱高台”上，同“旱魔”进行斗争，过着苦难的生活。
    解放以来，特别是人民公社成立后，南韩继人同干旱的斗争才取得一个又一个的胜利。
    八年间，南韩继粮食单位面积产量提高了两倍，平均每年递增百分之十五。现在许多社员户都有余粮，集体也有储备粮。八年来共向国家交售了二百六十多万斤粮食。定方向
    解放后，南韩继人从互助组到合作社，一直在寻找摆脱贫困的道路。走哪一条路？各个阶级有着不同的看法。一九五七年秋天，有些人（大都是富裕中农）提出主张，不要再啃这块干旱砂地，腾出主要劳力去搞“副业”。有个别干部也认为这是解渴的办法。但是广大贫农下中农社员不赞成，大声疾呼：不发展农业，单搞副业，这条道走不得！
    两种针锋相对的意见，反映了两条不同的道路、两个相反的方向。党支部及时提醒大家：不要忘记两年前的教训。那时想走资本主义道路的人掌权，曾经以搞副业为名，干投机买卖。那一年赚钱不少，可是大部分被少数搞“副业”的人分走了，集体的庄稼没种好，秋后靠国家调粮食吃。一心务农的贫农下中农社员，粮、钱都分得少。
    事实越摆越明，社员们说：这是发展资本主义的邪道。我们应该坚持以粮为纲、多种经营的方针，如果种地的都丢下锄头去抓钱，伸手向国家要粮，国家的粮食从哪里来？社会主义靠什么来建设？
    党支部书记徐庆文，深深懂得粮食的重要。这个曾经被地主逼出家门、参军后负伤转业回乡的“老八路”，以他亲身的经历对大家讲：“革命需要粮食。当年，国民党反动派封锁解放区，如果不是自己动手开荒种粮，就没办法战胜敌人。现在美帝国主义还在到处逞凶，如果我们农民为国家准备下充足的粮食，就等于给美帝最有力的反击”。
    党支部又引导社员回忆解放前后两次大旱的两种情况，使广大干部、社员更加热爱新社会和明白了“粮食是宝中之宝”这个平凡的真理。他们决心听党的话，把心思和力气用到农业上，迎着困难，坚持走以粮为纲的正确道路。抗干旱
    方向明确了，但是如何战胜干旱这个根本大敌？是听天由命，还是人定胜天？两种思想的交锋又在南韩继展开了。
    这里附近没有河流，唯一的办法只有打井。可是一提到打井，有些人就搬出世世代代流传在南韩继的一句老话：“旱高台”不到黄泉难见水。然而大队党支部认为：社会变了，过去办不到的事情，合作社社员应该办得到。既然村里打出过饮水井，地里就能打出灌溉井。
    就在一九五七年冬天，一支以党团员为骨干的打井队成立了。他们冒着寒风破土动工，在坚持了二十多个日夜以后，终于看到一滴滴泉水从井底的石头缝里渗出来。打井队员顾不得回家过年，一清早敲开供销社的大门，买回南韩继历史上第一台水车，连夜安装。
    大年初一，全村老老少少象赶庙会一样，挤到井旁看水车浇地。
    一九六○年，高压输电线路架到了南韩继，社员们就安装电机水泵，边抽水浇地，边深挖打井。随着井筒的不断加深，普通水泵已经无法把井水抽上来了。有人建议改用深井泵，但是一算账，每台要一万八千元，开支太多，干部社员就反复试验，最后，每眼井只花一千多元，就解决了深井取水问题。
    南韩继人就是这样从实际情况出发，逐步找出一条利用有限水源抗旱的道路。从一九五七年到一九六四年，他们一共打了五十多眼井，虽然有一半以上没打出水来或者坍毁了，但还是取得了巨大的收获：第一，打成功的十多眼井保证了全村百分之九十五的农田用水；第二，在很大程度上克服了人们的靠天思想，树立了人定胜天思想；第三，锻炼出一支敢于斗争不畏艰难的抗旱队伍。
    南韩继人就是在这种深谋远虑、不断革命的思想指导下，抗住一次又一次旱灾，取得一个又一个胜利。巧种田
      “旱高台”上有了水，肥料也相应地增多，到一九六二年，每亩地的施肥量已达一万五千斤。有了这些条件，南韩继人种出了好庄稼，粮食产量稳步上升。但是，新的任务又摆在南韩继人面前：继续发挥人的积极因素，在耕作制度上进行革命，在争取稳产的同时，进一步实现高产。
    一千二百亩土地是有限的，一百八十天无霜期也是没法变更的。但是南韩继人的智慧和干劲却是无穷的。他们决心利用一切有利条件，要把历史上的一年一季庄稼变成两茬庄稼。
    在党支部领导下，他们向外地学习了套种的经验。当六月初小麦开始黄梢时，就把玉米提早点种在小麦行间。等到六月下旬，金黄色的麦子一收割，绿油油的玉米苗早已冒出地面了，这样就保证了玉米在秋季种麦前有足够的生长期，同时夏种的劳动力也可以腾出来，全力以赴用于收割。
    但是，秋收季节更紧张。从收完玉米到种上冬小麦，也只有十多天时间。又要耕地，又要送粪，稍一耽搁，不是上千万斤肥料运不到地里，就是延误了小麦播种。为了解决这个尖锐的矛盾，社员们又群策群力想出了“留条地”的办法。他们在头年种麦时，就在每二、三十亩麦田里预留出一条六、七米宽的空白地，到来年春天，在这块“条地”上种谷、黍等成熟期较早的作物。到九月初，玉米还未成熟，谷、黍已经收割。腾出地来，先把种麦所需的粪肥运进去，堆着备用。再过几天，玉米收割了，社员们只要把“条地”上的粪肥往两侧地里散开，就可以适时耕地种麦。这样，他们就实现了“一亩地当两亩地种，一个太阳当两个太阳用”的豪迈誓言。
    南韩继人大破旧习惯，大胆改革耕作制度，一年种两茬、两茬都高产的经验，为北京郊区农民指出了提高复种指数的道路。
