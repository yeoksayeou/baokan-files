    Adhere to the Road of Giving Prominence to Politics and Integrating Theory with Practice
    Our Country Relies on its Own Efforts to Train Postgraduates Who are Both Red and Expert
    The Number of Postgraduates Trained by Universities and Scientific Research Institutions is Six Times Greater Than in the Early Days of Liberation
    This Year's Enrollment Work for Postgraduates in Science, Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine is About to Begin
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th – At present, the number of postgraduates being trained in universities and scientific research institutions in our country is six times greater than in the early days of liberation. In recent years, a batch of postgraduates have graduated and been assigned to more than 200 universities, scientific research institutions, and production departments. At present, the vast majority of high-level scientific and technical personnel needed for national construction can be trained by our country itself.
    Before liberation, our country rarely trained postgraduates, especially in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine. Almost all of them had to be sent abroad to study, which was one of the signs of the backwardness of culture and education in old China. In order to implement the Party's education policy and meet the needs of the development of cultural and educational, scientific and technological undertakings in our country, universities and scientific research institutions have been training postgraduates in relatively large numbers since 1959. In recent years, they have held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, adhered to the principles of giving prominence to politics and integrating theory with practice, and adopted the method of combining systematic theoretical study with scientific research, and combining collective training by teaching and research sections (research offices) with individual guidance from instructors, so that postgraduates can grow and develop in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements. Practice has proven that relying on our own strength, we can train talents who have socialist consciousness and a relatively high level of professional skills.
    The postgraduates who graduated in the last three years have specialized in more than 400 fields, many of which are urgently needed for our country's national defense and production construction. Among them, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for about 90%, and most of them have excellent academic performance. After being assigned to work posts, many postgraduates can adapt to the needs of the work more quickly, have strong independent working ability, and continue to make progress. Many have become the backbone of teaching or scientific research. Tsinghua University has graduated a total of 320 postgraduates in the past three years, who have been assigned to 40 universities and 82 scientific research institutions and production departments across the country, and have been well received by many units. The 19 postgraduates who graduated from this school in 1963 and stayed to work in the school have all undertaken more important teaching or scientific research work, and 12 of them have also served as Party and League cadres, deputy directors of laboratories, and class advisors for university students. In recent years, nine postgraduates from the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have stayed in the institute after graduation and have become the backbone of research work.
    In accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on education work, universities and scientific research institutions emphasize giving prominence to politics and vigorously strengthening ideological and political work in the work of training postgraduates. In recent years, many postgraduates have taken Mao Zedong's works as weapons, earnestly transformed their thinking, and established the viewpoint of studying for the revolution. Their mental outlook has undergone great changes, and they have achieved good results in learning and work. At present, the activity of studying Mao Zedong's works is being carried out in depth among postgraduates. In the past one or two years, universities and scientific research institutions have also organized a large number of postgraduates to participate in the socialist education movement and productive labor in urban and rural areas, so that they have received profound class education and labor education, initially established the ideological feelings of the working people, and promoted ideological transformation. Last year, more than 70 postgraduates from Harbin Institute of Technology went to the countryside, and 40% of them were praised by the commune.
    In order to lay a solid theoretical foundation and cultivate the ability to analyze and solve problems, postgraduates must carry out scientific research work while studying certain professional courses. Their research topics include national scientific research tasks undertaken by teaching and research sections and topics directly raised from current production. Under the guidance of teachers, some have made outstanding achievements. The Department of Geology of Nanjing University has systematically combined the research topics of postgraduates with the national research tasks it undertakes in its research on the South China granite and its metallogenic regularity. In recent years, a total of 25 postgraduates have participated in the work. Under the guidance of teachers, they have collected a large amount of geological data and independently written 47 scientific papers with a certain quality, which have made useful contributions to determining the different formation periods of South China granite, the distribution and evolution of granite, and the relationship between granite and mineralization. They grow up in practice and become an important force in the scientific research work of this department. Peng Tiequan, a postgraduate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University, has received better basic training and has conducted more experimental research on campus. He has cooperated with factories and, in less than half a year, proposed a polishing method to improve the smoothness of a measuring tool, enabling our country to produce measuring tools with world-class advanced levels that were previously relied on imports. Nankai University has recruited a total of 15 postgraduates in agricultural chemistry in recent years. Under the guidance of teachers, they have made contributions to finding new types of pesticides suitable for our country's conditions.
    In their study and scientific research work, many postgraduates, in the spirit of self-reliance, have overcome the difficulties in terms of instruments, equipment, and technical conditions by doing it themselves, and have achieved good results.
    In recent years, postgraduates trained by universities have also participated in a small amount of teaching work during their studies. Some postgraduates are assisting teachers in guiding undergraduates to do graduation theses or graduation designs in conjunction with research topics; others are participating in course or experiment tutoring. Because postgraduates are often with undergraduates, it is conducive to the training of undergraduates, and it also enriches the learning content of postgraduates and exercises their working ability.
    The teaching and research section of the university is the basic unit for training postgraduates. In the past two years, many teaching and research sections have also established special working groups to strengthen the leadership of the work of training postgraduates, and have absorbed relevant teachers to participate in the work of training postgraduates. While strengthening the collective training of the teaching and research section, the instructors also play an important role in the work of training postgraduates. In recent years, the number of instructors has increased rapidly, and many of them are young teachers and scientific researchers with high academic levels who have grown up after liberation.
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th – The work of enrolling postgraduates in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine by national universities and scientific research institutions in 1966 is about to begin. The application deadline for candidates is set from February 5 to April 10, 1966, and the unified examination will be conducted from May 29 to 31.
    1966 is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. Under the situation of a new upsurge in socialist revolution and socialist construction, according to the needs of further development of culture, education, science and technology in our country, the total number of postgraduates planned to be enrolled in 1966 will have a greater increase than in 1965. The enrolled postgraduates, according to the principle of combining collective training and individual guidance from instructors, will be responsible for training by more than 1,000 teaching and research sections (research offices) of universities and scientific research institutions. Under the leadership of the teaching and research section (research office), the instructors will undertake specific guidance work. Among the instructors, many are teachers and researchers with experience in teaching work and scientific research work.
    The enrollment targets for postgraduates in 1966 still include both undergraduate graduates and on-the-job personnel.
    At present, the enrollment units have established enrollment work organizations and are actively preparing for enrollment.

    坚持走政治挂帅、理论联系实际的道路
    我国自力更生培养又红又专的研究生
    目前高等学校和科学研究机关培养的研究生比解放初期增加了六倍
    今年理工农医各专业研究生的招考工作即将开始
    新华社十六日讯　目前，我国高等学校和科学研究机关正在培养的研究生，人数比解放初期增加了六倍。近几年来已有一批研究生毕业，分配到二百多个高等学校、科学研究机关和生产部门工作。目前国家建设所需要的较高水平的科学技术人材，绝大部分可以由我国自己培养。
    我国在解放前很少培养研究生，特别是理、工、农、医方面的研究生，几乎全部要送到外国去学习，这是旧中国文化教育落后的标志之一。为了贯彻执行党的教育方针，适应我国文化教育和科学技术事业发展的需要，从一九五九年起，各高等学校和科学研究机关比较大量地培养研究生。几年来，他们高举毛泽东思想红旗，发扬自力更生的精神，坚持政治挂帅、理论联系实际的原则，采取系统理论学习和科学研究相结合，教研室（研究室）集体培养和指导教师个别指导相结合的方法，使研究生在三大革命运动的实践中锻炼成长。实践证明，依靠自己的力量，是能够培养出具有社会主义觉悟，业务水平较高的人材的。
    最近三年毕业的研究生，所学的专业有四百多种，其中有许多专业是我国国防建设和生产建设所迫切需要的。他们之中，共产党员和共青团员占百分之九十左右，大部分人的学业成绩优良。许多研究生在分配到工作岗位以后，能够较快地适应工作需要，独立工作能力较强，而且不断进步，不少人已成为教学或科学研究的骨干力量。清华大学三年来共毕业了三百二十名研究生，分配到全国四十所高等学校和八十二个科学研究机关和生产部门工作，受到许多单位的好评。这个学校一九六三年度毕业后留校工作的十九名研究生，都担任了较重要的教学或科学研究工作，其中有十二人还担任了党、团干部，实验室副主任，大学生班主任等职务。中国科学院地质研究所近几年有九名研究生在毕业以后留本所工作，成为研究工作中的骨干力量。
    按照党中央和毛主席对教育工作的指示，各高等学校和科学研究机关在培养研究生的工作中，强调突出政治，大力加强思想政治工作。几年来，许多研究生以毛主席著作为武器，认真改造思想，树立为革命而学习的观点，精神面貌发生了很大变化，在学习和工作中取得了较好的成绩。目前，在研究生中学习毛主席著作的活动正在深入开展。最近一两年，各高等学校和科学研究机关还组织了大批研究生参加城乡的社会主义教育运动和生产劳动，使他们受到了深刻的阶级教育和劳动教育，初步树立了劳动人民的思想感情，促进了思想改造。哈尔滨工业大学去年下乡的七十多名研究生，有百分之四十的人受到公社的表扬。
    为了打好比较扎实的理论基础，培养分析问题和解决问题的能力，研究生在学习一定的专业课程的同时，还要进行科学研究工作。他们的研究题目，有的是教研室承担的国家科学研究任务，有的是直接从当前生产中提出的课题。他们在教师的指导下，有的做出了突出的成绩。南京大学地质系在进行华南花岗岩及其成矿规律的研究工作中，有计划地把研究生的研究课题与承担的国家研究任务结合起来，几年来共有二十五名研究生参加了工作。他们在教师的指导下，收集了大量的地质资料，独立写出了四十七篇具有一定质量的科学论文，为确定华南花岗岩不同的形成时期、花岗岩的分布与演化的规律以及花岗岩与成矿的关系，作出了有益的贡献。他们在实践中成长，成为这个系科学研究工作中一支重要力量。清华大学机械系研究生篷铁权，由于受到了较好的基本训练，在校内进行了较多的试验研究，与工厂合作，在不到半年的时间内，提出了提高一种量具光洁度的研磨方法，使我国能生产出过去依靠进口的具有世界先进水平的量具。南开大学几年来在农业化学方面共招收了十五名研究生。他们在教师指导下，为寻找适合我国情况的新型农药作出了贡献。
    许多研究生在学习和科学研究工作中，本着自力更生的精神，自己动手，克服了仪器设备和技术条件方面的困难，做出了较好的成绩。
    近几年来，高等学校培养的研究生，在学习期间还参加了少量的教学工作。有的研究生是结合研究课题，协助教师指导大学生做毕业论文或毕业设计；有的参加课程或实验的辅导工作。由于研究生经常和大学生在一起，有利于对大学生的培养，同时也丰富了研究生的学习内容，锻炼了工作能力。
    高等学校的教研室是培养研究生的基层单位。近两年来，许多教研室为了加强对培养研究生工作的领导，还成立了专门的工作小组，吸收有关的教师参与研究生的培养工作。在加强教研室集体培养的同时，指导教师在培养研究生的工作中也起着重要的作用。最近几年，指导教师人数迅速增加，其中有不少是我国解放后成长起来的具有较高学术水平的年青教师和科学研究人员。
    新华社十六日讯　一九六六年全国高等学校和科学研究机关招考理工农医各专业研究生的工作即将开始。考生申请报名日期定为一九六六年二月五日至四月十日，统一考试将在五月二十九日至三十一日进行。
    一九六六年是我国开始第三个五年计划的第一年。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设新高潮的形势下，根据我国文化教育和科学技术进一步发展的需要，一九六六年计划招收研究生的总数，将比一九六五年有较大的增长。招收的研究生，根据集体培养和指导教师个别指导相结合的原则，由高等学校和科学研究机关的一千多个教研室（研究室）负责培养。指导教师在教研室（研究室）的领导下，担任具体的指导工作。指导教师中，许多人是在教学工作和科学研究工作中有经验的教师和研究人员。
    一九六六年研究生的招生对象，仍包括大学本科应届毕业生和在职人员两部分。
    目前，各招生单位已经设立招生工作机构，积极进行招生的准备工作。
