    As the old year gives way to the new, 1966 has arrived. Our country's great Third Five-Year Plan will begin to be implemented this year. China's intellectuals, along with the people of the whole country, greet the new tasks with full confidence, greet the arrival of the new Five-Year Plan, and will do their work better and better, constantly renewing it.

    Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the revolutionization of intellectuals. All intellectuals who are willing and striving to carry out self-remolding have a deep understanding of this point. The primary task for us in studying Chairman Mao's works is to remold our own worldview with Mao Zedong Thought. We know that throughout the entire socialist period, there exist classes and class struggle, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The socialist revolution is a revolution to eliminate capitalism. All our work must take class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, and the purpose is to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois, to eradicate the roots of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism, and to consolidate and expand the socialist阵地阵地. The cultural revolution currently underway is precisely for this purpose. The work that the majority of intellectuals are engaged in is all at the forefront of the struggle to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois, serving the socialist revolution and construction, and serving the three great revolutions of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. Whether or not we can continue to advance on the road indicated by the Party, and make contributions to adapting our thinking and work to the requirements of promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois, depends on the remolding of our worldview. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In order to fully meet the needs of the new society, in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to remold themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian, communist worldview." The proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview are two fundamentally opposed worldviews. Intellectuals, "if they do not discard the old set and replace it with a proletarian worldview, will have different views, different positions, and different feelings from the workers and peasants, and will be incompatible with the workers and peasants." In this case, how can they withstand the test in the struggle to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois and serve the socialist cause well?

    Studying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental way for intellectuals to remold their worldview. What is particularly important here is to study and apply them in a living way, and to work hard on the word "apply." Truly achieve "I will do what Chairman Mao says." We must learn in practice, combining learning with application. Mao Zedong Thought is our great weapon for transforming the objective world and transforming the subjective world. Separating from the practice of the three great revolutions, separating from the practice of self-remolding, and not integrating with the worker-peasant masses will make it impossible to learn well or apply it. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and approaching the worker-peasant masses, can we truly learn." For intellectuals, it is especially important to study with ideological problems in mind and in connection with ideological realities. Only in this way can we be targeted and prescribe the right medicine, closely integrate with ideological transformation, see results, and make Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds.

    Using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work, exploring the laws of cultural and educational work and scientific research, so that cultural, educational, and scientific work can better serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and serve the three great revolutions. This is another major topic for intellectuals to study Chairman Mao's works.

    In the new year of starting the Third Five-Year Plan, we must further shift the focus of cultural, educational, and health work to the countryside, and further promote the cultural revolution. The new situation and new tasks have put forward new requirements for us. That is, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we must constantly accumulate and sum up experience in practice, explore the laws of cultural and educational work, discover the dialectics in our work, and make cultural and educational work better serve the socialist revolution and construction, and serve the three great revolutions.

    最根本的任务是学习和运用毛泽东思想
    ——《光明日报》元旦社论摘要
    岁序更新，一九六六年到来了。我国伟大的第三个五年计划从今年开始执行。我国的知识分子，和全国人民一起，满怀信心地迎接新任务，迎接新的五年计划的到来，把自己的工作做得好上加好，日新又新。
    毛泽东思想是知识分子革命化的指路明灯。一切愿意并且努力实行自我改造的知识分子，对这一点都是有深切体会的。我们学习毛主席著作的首要课题，就是用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观。我们知道，在整个社会主义时期里，存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。社会主义革命是消灭资本主义的革命。我们的一切工作都必须以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，目的都是为了兴无灭资，为了挖掉资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的根子，巩固和扩大社会主义的阵地。当前正在深入进行的文化革命，也正是为了这个目的。大多数知识分子所从事的工作，无一不是在兴无灭资斗争的前线，为社会主义革命和建设，为阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命服务的。能不能在党所指示的道路上不断前进，使自己的思想和工作适应兴无灭资的要求而作出贡献，关键在于世界观的改造。毛主席教导我们：“为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。”无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观是两种根本对立的世界观。知识分子，“如果不把过去的一套去掉，换一个无产阶级的世界观，就和工人农民的观点不同，立场不同，感情不同，就会同工人农民格格不入”，这样，怎么能够在兴无灭资斗争中经受住考验，很好地为社会主义事业服务呢？
    学习毛主席著作，是知识分子改造世界观的根本途径。这里特别重要的是活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。真正做到“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做。”要在实践中学，学用结合。毛泽东思想是我们改造客观世界和改造主观世界的伟大的武器，脱离三大革命的实践，脱离自我改造的实践，不同工农群众相结合，是学不好也用不上的。毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”对于知识分子来说，带着思想问题学，联系思想实际，尤其重要。只有这样，才是有的放矢，对症下药，才能同思想改造紧密结合，见到成效，使毛泽东思想在自己头脑里生根。
    用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导自己的工作，探索文化教育工作、科学研究工作的规律，使文教科学工作更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为三大革命服务。这是知识分子学习毛主席著作的另一个重大课题。
    在开始第三个五年计划的新的一年里，我们要进一步把文化、教育、卫生等方面工作的重点转向农村，进一步推进文化革命。新形势新任务，向我们提出了新的要求。这就是以毛泽东思想为指导，在实践中不断地积累和总结经验，探索文教工作的规律，发现工作中的辩证法，使文教工作更好地为社会主义革命和建设服务，为三大革命服务。
