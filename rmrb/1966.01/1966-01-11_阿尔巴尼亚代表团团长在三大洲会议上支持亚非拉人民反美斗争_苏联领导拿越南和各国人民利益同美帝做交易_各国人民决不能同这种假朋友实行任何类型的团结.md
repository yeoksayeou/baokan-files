    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 9th — Foto Çami, head of the Albanian delegation attending the Asian, African, and Latin American People's Solidarity Conference as an observer, distributed a written speech at the plenary session on the 8th, expressing resolute support for the heroic struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, especially the Vietnamese people, against U.S. imperialism, and exposing the Soviet new leadership's betrayal of the interests of Vietnam and other peoples.

    He said: "The main stronghold of imperialism and modern colonialism is the United States. The United States has taken on the task of saving the inevitable destruction of the shameful colonial system, playing the role of exploiter and international gendarme. Today, U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the people of the whole world."

    The head of the Albanian delegation then pointed out that on the Vietnam issue, "the very close connection between the United States and the Soviet Union—including the highest-level figures in their national leadership—is no longer a secret." He revealed that the Soviet leaders "have responded and are still responding to Johnson's deceptive plot of so-called 'unconditional negotiations,' and they are attempting to seek a 'political solution' to the Vietnam (problem) through their accomplices, regardless of the will of the Vietnamese people."

    He also pointed out that "the so-called 'aid' given by the Soviet leaders to Vietnam is by no means for the victory of the Vietnamese people's just struggle, but to deceive the people of all countries, to gain political capital, and to use it as a means of exerting pressure on the Vietnamese people and conducting larger deals with U.S. imperialism."

    He said: The great changes taking place in the three continents "do not come automatically, not due to the compassionate goodwill of colonialists and imperialists, nor due to the so-called peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition, and peaceful road preached by those who are doing these things together with the imperialist elements. Imperialist elements will never bestow freedom on the people of all countries, and they will never automatically give up the countries they exploit. The struggle of the people of all countries has been and is the great force that compels the imperialists to retreat."

    He said, "Never before has it been so necessary as today for the people of all countries of the world, for all the revolutionary forces of our time, to unite, form a united front, and wage a struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, in order to advance the great cause of the freedom and social progress of the people of all countries, and to create a new world without imperialism and without colonialism."

    The head of the Albanian delegation exposed the Soviet leaders' betrayal of the national liberation movement, saying, "The Soviet leaders have not only long abandoned the struggle against U.S. imperialism, but they are also doing everything possible to prevent others from opposing U.S. imperialism. Their entire political orientation is to strengthen friendly and multilateral cooperation with U.S. imperialism so that the two great powers can dominate the world. The people of all countries cannot accept this situation, and they resolutely condemn the concept of peaceful coexistence, which sacrifices the interests of the people of all countries and their struggles for liberation, with the aim of not harming Soviet-American friendship and cooperation." He said, "The Soviet leaders are doing their utmost to intimidate the people of all countries with the horror of nuclear war, and they oppose just revolutionary and freedom-seeking wars under the pretext that any spark may lead to a world confrontation. They are attempting to detach the people of all countries from the anti-imperialist struggle, to make them wait passively, for their freedom to come as a gift of peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition, and complete and universal disarmament."

    After listing a series of political deals made by the Soviet new leadership with U.S. imperialism in international affairs, the Albanian delegation head pointed out: "Obviously, the Soviet leaders, due to their alliance with U.S. imperialism, due to this whole political line of undermining and damaging the determination of the people of all countries to struggle and of revolutionary anti-imperialist forces, have placed themselves outside the united front of struggle against imperialism, new and old colonialism. It is impossible to carry out any kind of unity with these false friends of the people of all countries, the true allies of imperialism, or to carry out any kind of struggle action against the common enemy of the people of all countries. Only by resolutely carrying out the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and those who are doing common cause with imperialism can the anti-imperialist front of the people of the world be strengthened and expanded." He said that the chieftain of imperialism and its revisionist camp allies are trying to play the role of "friends" of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and they are tirelessly promising these people "political support" and "economic assistance." "However, in reality, the assistance of imperialism and its allies is a new chain that binds the people of all countries." "This assistance is given as alms, is used to plunder their wealth, and is an attempt to tie the hands and feet of the people of all countries," and "this assistance is cancelled whenever they want to exert pressure on these people and organize conspiracies against leaders whom someone does not like."

    He pointed out that "no matter how significant foreign aid is, it is always a secondary factor. In order to develop a country's economy and culture, one should first rely on one's own efforts and should rely on the material resources of one's own country."

    阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长在三大洲会议上支持亚非拉人民反美斗争
    苏联领导拿越南和各国人民利益同美帝做交易
    各国人民决不能同这种假朋友实行任何类型的团结
    新华社哈瓦那九日电  以观察员身份参加亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结会议的阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长福托·卡米八日在全体会议散发了书面发言，表示坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民特别是越南人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争，并且揭露苏联新领导背叛越南和各国人民的利益。
    他说：“帝国主义和现代殖民主义的主要堡垒是美国。美国把挽救可耻的殖民体系不可避免的毁灭（的任务）承担了起来，扮演了剥削者和国际宪兵的角色。今天美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶和最危险的敌人”。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长接着指出，在越南问题上，“美苏间建立了非常密切的联系——也包括了它们国家领导中的最高级人士——，现在这点已不是秘密”。他揭露说，苏联领导人“响应了并且仍然在响应约翰逊的所谓‘无条件谈判’的欺骗阴谋，他们不顾越南人民的意志企图通过他们的同伙寻求越南（问题）的‘政治解决’。”
    他还指出，“苏联领导人给越南的所谓‘援助’决不是为了越南人民的正义斗争取得胜利，而是欺骗各国人民，赢得政治资本和用来作为对越南人民施加压力的手段和同美帝国主义进行更大的交易”。
    他说：三大洲发生的巨大变化“不是自动来的，不是由于殖民主义者和帝国主义者的慈悲善愿，也不是由于那些人宣扬的所谓和平共处、和平竞赛和和平道路，这些人同帝国主义分子共同干这些事。帝国主义分子从来也不会把自由恩赐给各国人民，他们决不会自动放弃他们剥削的国家。各国人民的斗争过去和现在都是迫使帝国主义者退却的伟大力量。”
    他说，“没有任何时候象今天这样要求世界各国人民，要求我们时代的一切革命力量联合起来，组成统一阵线，开展反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，来推进各国人民的自由和社会进步的伟大事业，缔造一个没有帝国主义和没有殖民主义的新世界。”
    阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长揭露苏联领导人背叛民族解放运动说，“苏联领导人不只早就放弃了反对美帝国主义的斗争，而且还千方百计地不许别人反对美帝国主义。他们的全部政治方向是同美帝国主义加强友好和多边合作，以便两个大国主宰世界。各国人民不能接受这种情况，他们坚决谴责和平共处的观念，这种和平共处牺牲各国人民及其争取解放斗争的利益，目的是不损害苏—美友好和合作”。他说，“苏联领导人竭尽可能来用核战争的恐怖恫吓各国人民，他们在任何的星星之火都可能酿成世界对垒的借口下反对正义的革命的和争取自由的战争。他们企图使各国人民脱离反帝斗争，让他们消极等待着，他们的自由作为和平共处、和平竞赛和全面普遍裁军的礼物的到来。”
    在列举了苏联新领导在国际事务上同美帝国主义进行一系列的政治交易以后，阿尔巴尼亚团长指出：“显然苏联领导人由于他们同美帝国主义联盟，由于破坏和损坏各国人民斗争和革命反帝力量的决心的这一整套的政治路线，已置身于反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义斗争的统一阵线之外。不能同他们这些各国人民的假朋友、帝国主义的真盟友一起实行任何种类的团结、进行任何种类的反对各国人民共同敌人的斗争行动。只有坚决进行斗争，反对以美国为首的帝国主义和那些同帝国主义干着共同事业的人，世界各国人民的反帝阵线才能壮大加强。”他说，帝国主义魁首及其修正主义阵营的盟友企图扮演亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民“朋友”的角色，他们不倦地向这些人民许诺“政治支持”和“经济援助”。“但是，实际上帝国主义及其盟友的援助是捆绑各国人民的新锁链。”“这种援助是做为施舍给他们的，是用来掠夺他们的财富的，是企图束缚各国人民的手脚”，而“每当他们想对这些人民施加压力和组织阴谋反对某人所不喜欢的领导人时就取消这种援助”。
    他指出，“外援无论多么重大，它总是次要因素，为了发展国家的经济和文化，首先应该自力更生，应该依靠自己国家的物质资源。”
