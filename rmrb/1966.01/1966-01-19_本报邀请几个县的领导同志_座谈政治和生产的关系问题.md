    Editor's Note: Recently, this newspaper invited some comrades who came to Beijing to participate in the cotton conference to discuss the relationship between politics and production. Participating in the symposium were leading comrades from the county committees and county people's committees of Xinzhou in Hubei, Zunhua, Zhengding in Hebei, Cixi in Zhejiang, Jingyang in Shaanxi, and Beizhen in Liaoning. At the meeting, everyone exchanged ideas on some ideological understanding issues related to giving prominence to politics, based on their experience in practice. The comrades from these counties all proposed that, to handle the relationship between politics and production well, the problem should first be solved from the perspective of ideological understanding. Only by clarifying a series of fundamental issues such as the great significance of giving prominence to politics, the relationship between giving prominence to politics and class struggle, and what constitutes truly giving prominence to politics, can the relationship between politics and production be correctly handled. The following is a summary of the symposium:

    Giving Prominence to Politics Cannot Be Separated from Class Struggle; Only with Ideological Revolution Can There Be Production Revolution
    Comrade Yang Wenhua, Deputy County Head of Zunhua County, Hebei, said:
    In recent years, production in our county has greatly developed. The process of production development is a process of struggle between two roads and two ideologies; without ideological revolution, there is no production revolution; every step forward in production involves intense ideological struggle. This is becoming increasingly clear. Only by giving prominence to politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to take command can we overcome various non-proletarian ideologies.
    In 1959 and 1960, due to severe natural disasters, coupled with some shortcomings and errors in our work, temporary difficulties appeared in production in our county. How should we take the revolutionary road? There was much discussion at the time. To sum up, there were only two paths: one was to firmly take the socialist road, rely on the masses, overcome difficulties, and develop production; the other was that some people lost their way and wanted to take the capitalist road back, saying that mass movements were not allowed. This is class struggle. We grasped this key link, drew clear lines, thereby strengthened the socialist direction of the broad masses and mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses. Since 1961, production in our county has been increasing year by year.
    In the new situation, new problems arose again. Our county is an old revolutionary base area, with many old party members and old cadres. With improved production, some people thought that Zunhua County was remarkable. Should we carry forward the revolutionary tradition or carry the "remarkable" as a burden? After discussion, people became sober and realized: "Continuous revolution can lead to continuous leaps forward." Many communes and teams are determined to "stage new plays" in production and take it a step further.
    In 1964, the provincial party committee established our county as a model, and some people became proud again, saying "almost there," so the guiding ideology was simply to seek "stability" and lacked a revolutionary enterprising spirit. Many commune members said, "Are we afraid of good production?" This fully reflects that the leadership lagged behind the masses. We looked for the disease in the leadership's thinking and took medicine and surgery. Ideological examination is ideological struggle. We finally found the gap and came up with measures to ensure the continuous rise of production. The above situation shows that: leading production must start with political work and ideological struggle, whether in times of difficulty or in times of smooth sailing.

    Grasping Production Must Give Prominence to Politics
    Grasping Politics Cannot Talk Empty Theories
    Comrade Xu Zhengli, Deputy Secretary of the Xinzhou County Party Committee, Hubei, said:
    The principle that politics commands production is easy to understand. However, when it comes to specific matters, it is felt that political and ideological work is not easy to grasp. For example: if the task is urgent, such as repairing dikes and preventing floods, we arrange it today and act tomorrow, and political work cannot keep up; reforming a new system always has ideological obstacles, and there must always be some "pressure" at the beginning, and it seems impossible to rely entirely on "politics"; in backward areas, political and ideological work is not as easy to do as in advanced areas; political and ideological work is difficult in dealing with the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and so on.
    What problems do these ideas reflect? It shows a lack of sufficient understanding of political work.
    Currently, regarding the issue of politics and production, there are actually two ideological debates: one is to say that since politics is the commander, the first, then as long as we do a good job of political work and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, we don’t have to worry about anything else. They believe that grasping the specific leadership of production is engaging in "trivial philosophy." This is not right. We are leading large-scale socialist agricultural production. If we only talk about grand principles and do not do the organizational leadership work of production, and do not solve specific problems, isn’t that empty politics? A comrade in our county emphasized political work and opposed grasping specific production, resulting in backward production. When he became anxious, he turned around and resorted to coercive orders. It can be seen that political work is definitely not just talking empty theories without doing actual leadership work. The other is to say that politics is empty and soft, and production cannot be grasped empty-handed, so they only grasp production and do not ask about politics. This understanding is very common. We are still debating this issue there.
    We believe that the ideological and political work experience of the People's Liberation Army is basically applicable to rural areas. Our experience is that giving prominence to politics should not be limited to holding large meetings, making big reports, and talking about grand principles, but it is important to grasp living thoughts and be targeted.
    Comrade Zheng Gongqing, County Head of Jingyang County, Shaanxi, said:
    We have a problem in our county when doing political work, that is, we talk about big principles a lot, talk about them relatively empty, and the effectiveness is not good. From top to bottom, we always believe that production tasks are "hard," while political work is a regular thing, and it doesn't matter much whether we grasp it early or late. Not seriously grasping politics is the same from top to bottom, and it has become a habit. When the cadres below report, they talk more about production problems and less about political and ideological work. Why? Because the above grasps production tightly and does not grasp ideology tightly. So it can be said that whether or not we can give prominence to politics is mainly a problem of the county party committee leadership. Politics must be grounded in production. Why are Daqing and Dazhai good? Good, what do we use to assess? Especially agricultural production, we have to use the good or bad of production to assess. Political work must be combined with specific work, otherwise it is not called political work, but empty politics.

    Don't Think Only You Are Revolutionary
    Believing in the Masses Can Give Prominence to Politics
    Comrade Li Jinxi, Deputy Secretary of the Cixi County Party Committee and County Head of Zhejiang, said:
    Our county is a cotton-producing area. In the past, when doing work and grasping production, the county party committee considered reward policies a lot, such as implementing the method of sharing cotton overproduction, which resulted in capitalist tendencies among the peasants. In 1963, the higher authorities decided to abolish this method. At that time, the county party committee had a lot of concerns, mainly because they were afraid that the peasants would not accept this policy. Later, we conducted socialist education among the masses, explaining the reasons why the state wanted to monopolize cotton purchases, and the vast majority of peasants quickly accepted the state's policy. This incident shows that the leadership's thinking lagged behind the masses' thinking, and it shows that only with politics in command can we do a good job. In the past, we were just circling around economic interests and calculating economic accounts, and as a result, the more we calculated, the more confused we became, and it was extremely unfavorable to the development of socialist production.
    Comrade Zheng Gongqing said:
    To give prominence to politics, we must trust the masses. The Jinghui Canal in Jingyang County needs to be renovated. The province requires it to be completed in two years, and the county party committee initially felt unsure. What are the facts? The construction started last November, and in just over two months, the canal project was basically completed. Why? Because we explained the significance of this project to the masses and enlightened the masses' consciousness. This vividly illustrates that the leadership lagged behind the masses. Why did they lag behind? Because the leadership's ideology and politics were not in command. It also shows that once political work is given prominence, the enormous socialist enthusiasm among the masses can be brought into play.
    Comrade Liu Zhichen, County Head of Beizhen County, Liaoning, said:
    Beizhen County has better natural conditions, but production has not developed rapidly since liberation. Why? Because the leadership's thinking lacked a revolutionary enterprising spirit and had a serious "break-even" mentality. The masses' income was not small, but they did not engage in any basic construction for more than ten years. Last year, under the influence of the national revolutionary movement, we realized that the root cause of the stagnation in production for many years was the failure to give prominence to political work, so we could not mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses to build large-scale socialist agriculture. Based on the improvement of ideological understanding, a large-scale discussion was launched in the county last year. The process of discussion is the process of giving prominence to politics. The broad masses of the people understood the principle of farming for the revolution and were determined to be the masters of nature. Last autumn, the county built 110,000 mu of sloping farmland, basically realizing the terracing of sloping land; it harnessed a large amount of waterlogged land and converted it into platform fields and strip fields, completing what had not been completed in more than ten years. Where did this big change come from? It was because we grasped political work, because political work mobilized the labor enthusiasm of the people. The revolution in production is first and foremost the revolution of people. If people do not transform their thinking, they cannot transform nature. This is becoming increasingly clear.

    Whether or Not Politics Can Be Given Prominence Depends on the County Party Committee
    Doing Political Work Should Be Targeted at Living Thoughts
    Comrade Jiang Xiuwen, Deputy County Head of Zhengding County, Hebei, said:
    The recognition of the importance of political work and tasting the sweetness of it, in our county, started in the second half of 1964. For many years, grain and cotton production in our county has been stable but not high. Where is the problem? It is that the county party committee's politics are not in command. In 1964, under the national revolutionary situation, our thinking was touched. The county party committee, in the spirit of rectification, looked for gaps in ideology and bravely admitted that it was lagging behind. The mental state of the county party committee changed, and the cadres competed to go to the countryside to stay at points, leading the people of the county to study Chairman Mao's works in universities. In just over a year, grain and cotton in the county increased significantly. The same land, the same conditions, why create different yields? This can only be the result of giving prominence to politics, because politics changed people's mental outlook and mobilized their energy, so the production measures became strong.
    When doing political work, it is imperative to avoid talking empty theories and be highly targeted. To do ideological and political work for people, we must differentiate objects, have a sense of time, and combine it with work tasks. Only in this way can we truly produce results and exert power. Of course, there are many political works that have commonalities, such as studying Chairman's works. Whether it is the county, commune, team, or even the commune members, they all need to study, but there are different times and different work tasks in the middle, so there are different learning content. If a team has difficulties in its work, it will study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"; if there is a long period of drought and no rain, and the masses have the idea of waiting for rain, they will study "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle." Only by doing political work targeting thinking in this way can we achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    When doing political work, we must grasp the principle of less but refined. As the saying goes, "Greedy chewing is unpalatable," which is indeed very reasonable. The truth is not in quantity, but in "matching" the actual thoughts of the people. Our experience of what is called "matching" is to grasp living thoughts.
    Whether or not to grasp political work? Can political work be placed first and implemented throughout? Can we give prominence to politics even when we are busy? This is first and foremost a matter of the leadership's level of awareness. We admit that there are problems of understanding and problems of method in the middle, but we do not admit that there are practical problems. If there are practical problems, it provides an excuse for not grasping political work.
    How to put political work first? Our experience is that whether in arranging work, inspecting work, reporting work, or summarizing work, we must first ask about political work and analyze people's ideological state. To do this, the first thing is how the leadership understands the idea. Some comrades are accustomed to talking about output and measures as soon as they attend a meeting. The responsibility of leading cadres is to reverse this situation. Of course, output and measures must be grasped, but the first thing is to grasp people's ideological work and ask about the study of Chairman's works, and consciously use the virtual to bring the real. Over time, politics will blossom and bear fruit.
    The powerful weapon of political and ideological work is Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has the highest prestige, and Chairman Mao's words have the most power. Emphasizing political work must fully utilize this weapon.

### 本报邀请几个县的领导同志  座谈政治和生产的关系问题

    本报邀请几个县的领导同志
    座谈政治和生产的关系问题
    编者按：最近，本报邀请来京参加棉花会议的一些同志，座谈了政治与生产的关系问题。参加座谈会的有湖北新洲、河北遵化、正定、浙江慈溪、陕西泾阳、辽宁北镇等县的一些县委和县人委的领导同志。会上，大家就自己在实践中的体会，交谈了有关突出政治的一些思想认识问题。这几个县的同志都提出，要处理好政治与生产的关系，首先还是应该从思想认识上来解决问题。只有对突出政治的重大意义，突出政治与阶级斗争的关系，以及怎样才是真正的突出政治等一系列根本问题弄清楚了，才能正确处理好政治和生产的关系。下面是座谈的纪要：突出政治离不开阶级斗争有思想革命才有生产革命河北遵化县副县长杨文华同志说：
    近几年，我县生产有很大发展。生产发展的过程，就是两条道路、两种思想斗争的过程；没有思想革命，就没有生产革命；生产每进一步，都有激烈的思想斗争。这一点是越来越清楚了。只有突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，才能战胜各种非无产阶级的思想。
    一九五九年和一九六○年，我们县由于严重的自然灾害，加上工作上的一些缺点和错误，生产上出现了暂时的困难。革命的路子该怎么走？当时议论很多。归纳起来不外两条：一是坚定地走社会主义道路，依靠群众，战胜困难，发展生产；一是有些人迷失方向，想走资本主义的回头路，说什么群众运动搞不得。这就是阶级斗争。我们抓住这个纲，划清了界限，从而坚定了广大群众社会主义的方向，调动了群众的积极性，从一九六一年以来，我县的生产就逐年上升。
    在新的情况下，又产生了新的问题。我县是老革命根据地，老党员、老干部多。生产好了，又认为我们遵化县了不起了。是发扬革命传统呢，还是把“了不起”当包袱背起来？经过讨论，人们清醒了，认识到：“不断革命，才能不断跃进。”很多社队决心在生产上“排新戏”，再进一步。
    一九六四年，省委把我县树为标兵，又有人骄傲起来，说“差不多”了，于是指导思想上单纯求“稳”，缺乏革命的进取心。很多社员说：“生产还怕好？”充分反映了领导落后于群众。我们从领导思想上找病症，吃药、开刀。思想检查，就是思想斗争。我们终于找出了差距、想出了措施，保证了生产不断地上升。以上情况都说明：领导生产，必须从政治工作入手，从思想斗争入手，无论在困难时候，或者是在顺利时候都如此。
    抓生产必须突出政治
    抓政治不能讲空道理
    湖北新洲县委副书记徐正利同志说：
    政治统帅生产的道理，是容易理解的。但是，一触到具体事情，便感到政治思想工作不好抓。例如：任务紧急，象修堤防汛，今天布置，明天行动，政治工作就赶不上；改革一项新的制度，总有思想障碍，开始总得有点“压力”，全凭“政治”好象不行；在落后的地方，政治思想工作不如先进地区好做；在处理国家、集体和个人三者关系上政治思想工作难做等等。
    这些思想反映什么问题？说明对政治工作缺乏足够的认识。
    当前关于政治与生产问题，实际上存在着两种思想的争论：一种是说，既然政治是统帅，是第一，那么只要作好政治工作，把群众积极性发动起来，就什么也不用管了。他们认为，抓了生产的具体领导，就是搞“烦琐哲学”。这种说法不对。我们领导的是社会主义大农业生产，如果只讲大道理，不做生产的组织领导工作，不解决具体问题，岂不是空头政治？我们县有位同志强调政治工作，反对抓具体生产，结果生产落后了，他一着急，转过来又搞强迫命令。可见政治工作绝对不是只讲空道理，不去做实际领导工作。另一种是说，政治是空的，是软的，抓生产不能空抓，因而就只抓生产，不问政治。这种认识很普遍。对于这个问题，我们那里还在争论。
    我们认为：解放军的思想政治工作经验，农村基本上都适用。我们的体会：突出政治不能只限于开大会，作大报告，讲大道理，重要的是抓活思想，有针对性。陕西泾阳县县长郑公卿同志说：
    我们县做政治工作有个问题，就是大道理讲得多，讲得比较空，实效不好。从上到下，总认为生产任务是“硬”的，而政治工作是经常的事，早抓晚抓问题不大。不认真抓政治，从上到下都是一样，成了习惯。下面的干部汇报，谈生产问题多，讲政治思想工作少。为什么？因为上面对生产抓得紧，思想抓得不紧。所以说能不能突出政治，主要是县委领导的问题。政治一定要落脚在生产上。大庆、大寨为什么好？好，用什么来考核？特别是农业生产，就得用生产好坏来考核。政治工作必须同具体工作结合，否则就不叫政治工作，而是空头政治。
     不要以为只有自己革命
    相信群众才能突出政治
    浙江慈溪县委副书记、县长李金溪同志说：
    我们县是棉产区。过去搞工作，抓生产，县委考虑奖励政策多，例如实行棉花超产分成的办法，结果造成农民中的资本主义倾向。一九六三年上级决定取消这个办法，当时县委很有顾虑，主要是怕农民接受不了这项政策。后来我们向群众进行了社会主义教育，讲清楚国家为什么要统购棉花的道理，绝大多数农民很快接受了国家的政策。这件事说明领导思想落后于群众思想，说明只有政治挂帅，才能做好工作。过去我们尽在经济利益上打圈子，算经济账，结果越算越糊涂，而且对发展社会主义生产极为不利。郑公卿同志说：
    突出政治，一定要信任群众。泾阳县境内的泾惠渠，需要重新修整，省里要求两年完成，县委最初感到把握不大。事实呢？去年十一月开始动工的，两个多月，斗渠工程就基本上完成了。为什么？就因为向群众讲清了这个工程的意义，启发了群众的自觉。这生动地说明了领导落后于群众。为什么落后？就因为领导思想政治不挂帅。也说明了，一旦突出了政治工作，就可以把群众中的巨大的社会主义积极性发挥出来。辽宁北镇县县长刘志臣同志说：
    北镇县自然条件较好，可是解放后生产发展不快。为什么？因为领导思想缺乏革命的进取心，有严重的“保本”思想。群众收入不少，却十多年没有搞什么基本建设。去年，在全国的革命化运动的影响下，认识到多年来生产上不去的根子，是没有突出政治工作，因此不能把广大干部和群众建设社会主义大农业的积极性调动起来。在思想认识提高的基础上，去年在全县开展了一场大讨论。讨论的过程，就是突出政治的过程。广大人民懂得了种田为革命的道理，决心要作自然界的主人。去年一个秋季，全县修筑了十一万亩坡耕地，基本实现坡地梯田化；治理了大量涝洼地，改成台田、条田，完成了十几年来未曾完成的事情。这个大改变那里来？是因为抓了政治工作，是因为政治工作调动了人民群众的劳动热情。生产革命首先是人的革命，人不改造思想，就改造不了自然。这一点越来越明确。
    能否突出政治关键在县委
    做政治工作要针对活思想河北正定县副县长姜秀文同志说：
    认识政治工作的重要，而且尝到甜头，在我县来说，是从一九六四年下半年开始。多年来，我县粮棉产量稳而不高。问题在那里？就是县委政治不挂帅。一九六四年，在全国革命化的形势下，我们的思想被触动了。县委以整风的精神，找思想上的差距，勇敢地承认了自己落后。县委的精神状态变了，干部争先下乡蹲点，领导全县人民大学毛主席著作，仅仅一年多，全县粮棉大幅度上升。同样的土地，同样的条件，为什么创造出不同的产量？这只能是突出政治的结果，因为政治把人们的精神面貌改变了，干劲调动起来了，由此生产措施就过硬了。
    做政治工作，切忌讲空道理，要有强烈的针对性。做人的思想政治工作，要分别对象，要有时间观念，要结合工作任务，只有这样，才能真正产生作用，发挥威力。当然，有很多政治工作是有共性的，例如学习主席著作，不论县、社、队以至社员都需要学，但是这中间有个不同时间、不同工作任务，因此有不同的学习内容。那个队工作中有困难了，就学《愚公移山》，那个时间久旱不雨，群众有等雨思想，就学《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》。只有这样针对思想做政治工作，才能事半功倍。
    做政治工作，一定要掌握少而精的原则。俗话说“贪多嚼不烂”，确实很有道理。道理不在多，而在于同人们的思想实际“对号”，所谓“对号”，我们的体会就是抓活思想。
    抓不抓政治工作？能不能把政治工作摆在首位而且贯彻始终？能不能越是忙越突出政治？这首先是个领导觉悟程度的问题。我们承认这中间有认识问题、有方法问题，而不承认有实际问题。如果说有实际问题，那就为不抓政治工作提供了借口。
    如何把政治工作摆在首位？我们的体会是无论在布置工作、检查工作、汇报工作、总结工作时首先要过问政治工作，要分析人的思想状态。而要做到这一点，首先在于领导的思想如何认识。有些同志一开会就习惯于谈产量、谈措施。领导干部的责任就在于把这种状况扭转过来，产量、措施当然要抓，但首先要抓人的思想工作，要过问主席著作的学习情况，要有意识地以虚带实。久而久之，政治也就开花结果了。
    强有力的政治思想工作武器是毛泽东思想。毛主席的威望最高，毛主席的话最有力量。强调政治工作，一定要充分运用这一武器。
