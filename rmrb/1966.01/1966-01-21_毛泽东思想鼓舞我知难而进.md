    Mao Zedong Thought Encourages Me to Advance Despite Difficulties
    Last October, I was transferred from the propaganda department of another county to Danleng to serve as the county Party secretary. Whether from the perspective of ideological cultivation or work ability, I was not yet able to fully adapt to the demands of the job. Upon arriving in Danleng County, I was unfamiliar with the situation, and the comrades did not know each other in the past, so there was a lack of mutual understanding. For a time, I felt that being a good "squad leader" of the county Party committee would be very difficult. Should I advance despite the difficulties, or retreat because of them? I turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance and used Mao Zedong Thought to solve my own ideological problems. Only then did I see that there were many favorable conditions for doing a good job. For example, the youthfulness of the leading members is a significant favorable factor. The average age of our county Party committee's secretaries, deputy secretaries, and county head is 34 and a half years old, and the average age of the seven standing committee members is 35 and a half years old. Everyone is energetic, full of vigor, and unafraid of difficulties. More than half of the standing committee members of the county Party committee are from other places, and they brought with them the good experiences, good work styles, and good traditions of their brother counties. By learning from each other's strengths and helping each other, we can do a good job. As for me, I must first learn diligently from other comrades and also promote mutual learning among comrades. We must pay special attention to the unity among comrades, the unity between cadres from other places and local cadres, the unity between leading cadres and grassroots cadres, and the unity between new cadres and old cadres. This unity is sincere, it is unity under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it is unity that adheres to the principles of the Party, it is unity with criticism and self-criticism, and it is not unprincipled harmony. Only by paying attention to fostering the unity of leading cadres in our work can we bring into play the leadership role of the county Party committee, and only then can we talk about the revolutionization of the county Party committee's leadership.
    Danleng is a small county. However, on the issue of the revolutionization of the county Party committee's leadership, there is no distinction between large and small counties. Small counties must do as much hard and in-depth work as large counties, have the same revolutionary vigor, and emphasize politics in the same way. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and only with an extremely responsible revolutionary spirit can we lead the masses to advance by leaps and bounds.
    Danleng's production is still quite backward. To catch up with and surpass the advanced, in addition to strengthening ideological and political work in the countryside, carrying out the study of Chairman Mao's works among cadres and the masses, and raising the ideological consciousness of cadres and commune members so that they understand the principle of farming for the revolution, the leading cadres of the county Party committee all go to production teams to squat, insisting on participating in labor. I brought a hoe from Pengshan County, but the hard, dead yellow mud soil of Danleng County was not suitable for it, so the leading comrades of the county Party committee specially made several large hoes, twice as heavy as the original ones. Carrying them, we can better labor together with the masses.
    I think that in this new position, to be a good "squad leader," my thinking and drive must also undergo a revolution, just like the hoe I use, in order to adapt to the needs of the new situation. Spring is coming, and I will bring Chairman Mao's works, carry my new hoe, go to the forefront of production, and work shoulder to shoulder with the broad masses to make more contributions to the revolution and the people.

    毛泽东思想鼓舞我知难而进
    去年十月，我由外县的宣传部门调到丹棱担任县委书记的职务。无论从思想修养、工作能力各方面说，都还不大能适应工作的要求。新到丹棱县，情况不熟悉，同志们过去彼此都不认识，因此互不了解，一时感到要当好县委会的“班长”，难题很多。是知难而进呢，还是知难而退呢？我向毛主席的著作求教，用毛泽东思想来解决自己的思想问题，我才看到了做好工作还有许多有利条件。如领导成员年轻，就是一个很大的有利因素。我们县委正副书记、县长四人，平均年龄三十四岁半，七个县委常委平均年龄三十五岁半。大家干劲大，朝气蓬勃，不怕困难。县委常委一半以上是外地来的，也就随身把兄弟县的好经验、好作风、好传统带了来，大家取长补短，互相帮助，就可以做好工作。至于我，首先要好好向其他同志学习，并且推动同志间互相学习。我们一定要特别注意同志之间的团结，外来干部和当地干部团结，领导干部和基层干部团结，新干部和老干部团结。这种团结是真诚的，是在毛泽东思想指导下的团结，是坚持党的原则的团结，是有批评与自我批评的团结，而不是无原则的一团和气。只有在工作中注意搞好领导干部的团结，才能发挥县委领导的作用，也才谈得上县委领导革命化。
    丹棱是个小县。但是，在县委领导革命化这个问题上，没有大县小县之分，小县要和大县一样，做艰苦深入的工作一样，革命干劲一样，突出政治一样，要用毛泽东思想挂帅，以极端负责的革命精神，才能领导群众大步前进。
    丹棱的生产还相当落后。要赶上和超过先进，我们除了加强农村思想政治工作，在干部和群众中开展毛主席著作的学习活动，提高干部和社员的思想觉悟，使他们懂得为革命种田的道理以外，县委领导干部都到生产队蹲点，坚持参加劳动。我从彭山县带来一把锄头，丹棱县坚硬的死黄泥土不合用，县委几个领导同志就专门打了几把大锄头，比原来的重一倍，带着它就能更好与群众一同劳动。
    我想，在这新的岗位上，要当好“班长”，我的思想和干劲，也要象我用的锄头一样，需要来一场革命，才能适应新形势需要。春天就要到来，我要带上毛主席著作，扛起新锄头，走上生产第一线，和广大群众肩并肩地大干一场，为革命、为人民多作出一些贡献。
