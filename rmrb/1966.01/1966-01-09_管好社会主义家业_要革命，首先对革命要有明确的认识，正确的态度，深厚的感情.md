    Managing the Socialist Estate
    To Make Revolution, First Have a Clear Understanding, Correct Attitude, and Deep Feelings for Revolution
    I studied oil refining. Due to the needs of the revolution, I became a warehouse keeper. When I first started working, the instructor gave me the two books "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I read them carefully, again and again, and thought about them over and over. Gradually, I realized that to make revolution, one must first have a clear understanding of revolutionary work, a correct attitude, and deep feelings. I understood that today's warehouse keeper is managing the socialist estate. Zhang Side burned charcoal for the revolution, and I am managing the household for the revolution. Therefore, I wholeheartedly became a warehouse keeper, striving to manage every penny well for socialism.
    Initially, the organization asked me to manage oil and chemical reagents. Whether it was a few pounds of machine oil or a few taels of reagents, I weighed them meticulously. Although this work was both trivial and troublesome, I felt that: one cannot be afraid of trouble when making revolution. As long as it is beneficial to the revolution, I am willing to take the trouble. I hold the scale steady, so that every bit of the country's wealth is used on the cutting edge of the revolution. Once, some diesel fuel was transported in, and I climbed into the large oil drums that had not been completely emptied to scoop out the remaining oil. Although I felt a little uncomfortable from the fumes and suffocation, I was willing to endure any dirt or fatigue, as long as I could avoid wasting even a fraction of a cent for the country. Wielding a gun to fight the enemy is certainly revolution, but can't I also be making revolution by adding a brick or a tile to socialist construction in an ordinary post?
    As the oil refining facilities were gradually being built, some classmates returned to their oil refining positions. I remained unwavering, willing to watch over the warehouse for the revolution for the rest of my life. At that time, it was winter, and the leaders asked me to manage the labor protection warehouse. The warehouse was drafty on all sides. Being from the south, my cotton clothes were thin, and I was very cold at night in the warehouse. Someone said, "You're in charge of so many cotton clothes, why don't you put one on?" I felt that as a warehouse keeper, I only had the responsibility to manage the property entrusted to me well, and I had no right to use it.
    Over the past few years, I have received and dispatched many materials, without losing or sending the wrong one. I am determined to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and always be like Zhang Side, serving the people wholeheartedly, proceeding from the interests of the country, the people, and the revolution in everything, and treating the materials entrusted to me by the people as my own lifeblood.

    管好社会主义家业
    要革命，首先对革命要有明确的认识，正确的态度，深厚的感情
    我学的是炼油，由于革命需要，我当了库房保管员。一开始工作，指导员就给我《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两本书，我认真地读了又读，想了又想，逐步认识到，要革命，首先对革命工作要有明确的认识，要有正确的态度，深厚的感情。我懂得了，今天的保管员，管的是社会主义家业。张思德为革命烧炭，我是为革命管家。于是，我就一心一意地当保管员，努力为社会主义管好每一分钱。
    开始，组织上叫我管油料、化学药品。这个领几斤机油，那个称几两药剂，我都一丝不苟地给称。这工作虽然既琐碎、又麻烦。但我觉得：干革命就不能怕麻烦，只要对革命有利，我就愿意麻烦。把稳秤杆子，让国家一点一滴的财富都用在革命的刀刃上。有一次运进一些柴油，我钻进没倒净的大油桶里，把剩油掏出来。虽然自己连熏带闷有点受不住，但一想到为国家避免一分一厘的浪费，再脏再累也情愿。拿枪杆打敌人固然是革命，我在平凡的岗位上，能为社会主义建设添一砖一瓦，不也同样是闹革命吗！
    炼油装置陆续建设起来了，有的同学回到炼油岗位上去了，我毫不动摇，甘愿为革命看
  一辈子库房。那时，正是冬天，领导又叫我管劳保库。当时的库房四面透风，我是南方人，身上的棉衣薄，夜里呆在库房里冷得很。有人说：“你管着那么些棉衣服，就不会披上一件吗？”我觉得，做保管员的，只有责任把交给我的财物管好，没有权利去动用它。
    几年来，经我手收发的物资很多，没有损失过一件，也没收发错一件。我决心按照毛主席的指示办事，永远象张思德那样，以全心全意为人民服务的精神，处处从国家、从人民、从革命的利益出发，把人民交给我的物资，当成自己的命根子。
