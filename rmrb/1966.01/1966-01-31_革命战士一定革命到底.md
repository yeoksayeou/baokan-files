    Revolutionary Fighters Must Revolutionize to the End
    Comrade Wei Wei:
    Yesterday I received your letter, and I was so happy that I couldn't sleep all night. Fifteen years ago, when American imperialism extended the flames of aggression to our country's borders, you used your pen, and I used my gun, and together we fiercely struck at American imperialism. The flames of the Korean War forged our combat friendship.
    I am sincerely grateful for the many encouragements and spurs you gave me in your letter. Speaking of the things I've done, they really aren't worth mentioning. I've only done what a revolutionary fighter and a Communist Party member should do, and all of this is still far from the Party's requirements. This isn't just polite talk; I truly feel this way. Not long ago, when the Hunan Provincial Party Committee made the decision to have the entire province learn from me, I felt very uneasy. Even if there were some achievements in my past work, it was the result of the Party's constant education. The honor should belong to the Party.
    I was once a blind man. For ten years, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of comrades, I have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works. I deeply feel that every step I take forward on the revolutionary path is due to the Party's teachings and the strength that Chairman's works give me.
    In 1955, I was transferred from the army to work at the Hanshou County Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. At that time, I had a little bit of light perception in my left eye, barely enough to see the road. Reading documents, materials, and studying was impossible. But how can you do work without reading documents or studying? Plus, I wasn't familiar with the local work, and my thinking was quite pessimistic for a time. The leadership understood my feelings and encouraged me to study Chairman's works. I studied them, and I immediately felt brighter inside. Yes, the Foolish Old Man could move mountains in the past. Can I, a Communist Party member, be afraid of difficulties? No, absolutely not. I finally straightened my chest. But starting in 1958, I went completely blind, making it even more difficult to work. At this time, my thinking wavered again: "A blind man can't do work. Why not just retire? Anyway, according to national regulations, I can not work given my situation." When I had problems with my thinking, I again consulted Chairman's works.
  "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." Chairman's teachings, the image of the Foolish Old Man moving mountains, lit up my heart again. My thinking settled down. In 1962, when Chiang Kai-shek clamored to counterattack the mainland, I picked up the work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" to study. Chiang Kai-shek is still entrenched in Taiwan, the domestic bourgeoisie still exists, the class struggle has not been extinguished, and the world is not yet at peace. Thinking about retiring at this time only shows that I have a retreating mentality. At this time, the scene from fourteen years ago flooded back into my mind: Under a pine forest on the Korean battlefield, American bandit planes flying overhead, the booming of artillery in my ears, the instructor leading me and another comrade in taking the Party membership oath... Dai Dubo, from the day you joined the Party, you only have the obligation to fight for the revolution and the cause of communism to the end, and you have no right to retreat in the slightest. Yes, we must revolutionize to the end.
    Comrade Wei Wei, I am increasingly realizing that as long as you study Chairman's works with your heart, you can draw tremendous spiritual strength from them. For ten years, in addition to the study time stipulated by my unit, I have insisted on studying for half an hour to an hour every morning after getting up and every night before turning off the lights. Someone once asked me: "What kind of thinking supports you, a blind person, in persistently studying Chairman Mao's works?" My understanding is: A true revolutionary must revolutionize while alive, and to revolutionize, one must master Mao Zedong Thought.
    Of course, for a blind person like me, learning has many difficulties. When there was still a little bit of light perception in my left eye, I could still see for myself, though with some difficulty, by wearing a magnifying glass. After I went completely blind, I had to ask others for help. Asking someone to read to me once or twice isn't a big problem, but after a long time, I was afraid that some comrades would get annoyed. What to do? I made study friends and studied together. Some problems that my study friends in my unit couldn't understand, I expanded the method of making study friends to outside units and other places, widely seeking teachers and advice. Over the past ten years, more than twenty study friends have helped me study, including army comrades, office cadres, employees of my unit, and school teachers. I am very grateful for these comrades' help.
    I am convinced of one truth: If there are difficulties, learn from the Foolish Old Man, and you can definitely overcome them.
    Speaking of the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets," I have also often considered this issue in recent years. I often think: "Sugar-coated bullets" hit people silently and invisibly. The harm they do to people isn't like a bullet that causes immediate pain. Instead, they corrode you little by little, finally exploding, and at that point, the person hit has already become a prisoner of the bourgeoisie. As the saying goes: It's easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to guard against an arrow in the dark. "Sugar-coated bullets" are like arrows in the dark, so we must be extra vigilant. How do we defend against them? I have set three rules for myself, and these three rules are what the Party often educates us to do, which are: persistently studying Chairman's works; maintaining the style of hard struggle; and participating in labor.
    Comrade Wei Wei, this letter has already become very long, but I still want to tell you a piece of good news: After treatment, I can see well enough to walk, see people's faces clearly, and see the subtitles in the newspaper when I wear glasses. Last August, when I went to Beijing to attend the national supply and marketing system professional meeting, I couldn't see anything at all. On August 17th, Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, and other Party and state leaders received us, the representatives attending the meeting, and took photos with us. Unfortunately, I couldn't see Chairman Mao, and I was extremely anxious.
    After the meeting, the leadership sent me to Tongren Hospital to treat my eyes. Many famous doctors had treated my eyes before, and they all said that this condition couldn't be cured in any country in the world. I had already lost hope. To be honest, I didn't have much hope when I first entered the hospital. Even the doctors at Tongren Hospital said: "According to the previous rules, your eyes have no medical value. To be responsible to the Party and to the patient, we will accept you for inpatient treatment." Who would have thought that after treatment, my left eye would regain its sight. This matter moved me greatly, not only because the doctors cured my eyes, but also because I thought that it was the same Tongren Hospital, the same type of patient as me. In the past, it was thought that it was impossible to cure, so patients weren't treated at all. Now, the doctors have studied Chairman's works, learned from the People's Liberation Army, greatly boosted their revolutionary drive, and broken down rules and regulations, finally curing eyes that were previously considered to have "no medical value." How powerful is Mao Zedong Thought!
    I have three children: the oldest is a daughter, eight years old; the second is a boy, five years old; and the youngest is a daughter, three years old. Our family life is very happy. Thank you for asking about us.
    I am sending you a recent photo of myself.
        With respect,
                      Dai Dubo

### 革命战士一定革命到底

专栏：革命书信

    革命战士一定革命到底魏巍同志：
    昨天我收到你给我的信，我高兴得一晚上没睡好觉。十五年前，当美帝国主义把侵略的战火烧到我们祖国边境的时候，你用你的笔，我用我的枪，我们一齐狠狠打击美帝国主义。抗美援朝的炮火，使我们结下了战斗的友谊。
    你在信里给了我很多鼓励和鞭策，我从心里感谢。要说我做的那些事情，实在算不了什么，我只是做了一个革命战士、一个共产党员应该做的，而且这一切，距离党的要求还很远。这不是客气话，我确确实实是这样想的。不久以前，当湖南省委作出决定，要全省向我学习的时候，我心里很不安。过去工作上即使有点子成绩，也是党不断教育的结果，荣誉，应该属于党。
    我曾经是个双目失明的人，十年来，在党的领导和同志们的帮助下，坚持学习毛主席著作。我深深感到，在革命的道路上，我每前进一步，都是由于党的教导，由于主席著作给我的力量。
    一九五五年，我从部队转业到汉寿县花纱布公司工作。当时左眼有一点点光感，只能勉强看清路，看文件、看材料、学习，都不行。可干工作哪能不看文件不学习呀？加上不熟悉地方工作，思想有一度蛮悲观。领导上了解我的心情，鼓励我学习主席著作，我学了，心里立即觉得亮堂了。是呀，昔日愚公能移山，我，一个共产党员，能怕困难？不能，万万不能。我终于挺起了胸。可是一九五八年开始，眼睛完全瞎了，工作起来更困难，这时思想又动摇了：“眼瞎搞工作不行啊，干脆退休吧，反正按国家规定，象我这样的情况可以不工作。”思想有了问题，我又向主席著作请教。
  “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”主席的教导，愚公移山的形象，又把我的心拨亮了。思想安定下来。到一九六二年蒋介石叫嚣反攻大陆的时候，我拿起《将革命进行到底》这篇著作来学习。蒋介石还盘踞在台湾，国内资产阶级还存在，阶级斗争并没有熄灭，天下还没有太平呐，我在这时候想到退休，不正说明我有退坡思想吗？这时，十四年前的情景又在脑子里涌现：在朝鲜战场的一片松树林下，头上飞着美国强盗的飞机，耳边是隆隆的炮声，指导员领着我和另一个同志举行入党宣誓……。戴笃伯呀戴笃伯，从你入党的那天起，你只有为革命、为共产主义事业奋斗到底的义务，丝毫没有退却的权利。对，一定要革命到底。
    魏巍同志，我越来越体会到，主席的著作，只要你用心学，就能够从中吸取到巨大的精神力量。十年来，除了本单位规定的学习时间之外，每天早晨起床后，晚上熄灯前，我都要坚持半个小时到一个小时的学习。曾经有人问我：“你一个双目失明的人，能坚持不懈学习毛主席著作，是什么思想支持的？”我的认识是：一个真正的革命者，活着就要革命，革命就要掌握好毛泽东思想。
    当然，对我这样一个瞎眼人来说，学习是有很多困难的。左眼还有一点光感的时候，戴上放大镜，虽然吃力一些，自己还能看；完全失明以后，就只好请人帮忙了。请人念给我听，一遍两遍问题不大，时间长了，怕有的同志厌烦。怎么办？我就交学习朋友，一块儿学。有些问题本单位的学习朋友领会不了，我就把交学习朋友的办法扩大到外单位、外地，广泛拜师求教。十年来，先后帮助我学习过的学习朋友有二十多个，有部队战友、机关干部、本单位职工、学校老师。我非常感谢这些同志对我的帮助。
    我认定一条理：有困难，学愚公，一定可以克服。
    说到资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”，这几年，我也经常考虑这个问题。我常常想：“糖衣炮弹”打到人身上，无形，无声。它对人的伤害，不象炮弹那样打到了立刻使你感到一阵剧痛，而是一点点腐蚀，最后来个爆炸，那时，中弹的人就已经成为资产阶级的俘虏了。俗话说：明枪好躲，暗箭难防。“糖衣炮弹”就象暗箭，要加倍警惕。怎么防御呢？我给自己订了三条，这三条也就是党经常教育我们要这样做的，那就是：坚持不懈学习主席著作；保持艰苦奋斗的作风；参加劳动。
    魏巍同志，这封信已经写得很长了，但是我还要告诉你一件喜讯：我的眼睛经过治疗，戴上镜子，能看见走路，能看清人的面孔，能看清报纸上的小标题了。去年八月，我到北京开全国供销系统专业会议的时候，还什么都看不见。八月十七日那天，毛主席、刘主席等党和国家领导人接见我们参加会议的代表，和我们一起照相。可惜我看不见毛主席，心里急得什么似的。
    开完会，领导上送我到同仁医院治眼睛。我的眼睛，先后有不少名医给我治过，都说这种情况目前世界各国都不能治。我都已经死了心了，刚进医院的时候，老实说，没抱多大希望。就是同仁医院的医生也说：“按以前的规矩，你的眼睛没有医疗价值了，为了对党、对病人负责，我们接受你入院治疗。”哪曾想到，经过治疗，左眼竟重见光明。这件事情使我十分感动，不仅仅因为医生治好了我的眼睛，我是想，同是同仁医院，同是我这种病人，以前认为不可能治好，干脆不给病人治；现在，医生们学习了主席著作，学习了解放军，大鼓革命干劲，打破条条框框，终于治好了过去认为“没有医疗价值”的眼睛，毛泽东思想的威力有多大啊！
    我有三个孩子了，大的是女儿，八岁；第二个是男孩，五岁；小的是女儿，三岁；我们的家庭生活很美满，谢谢你问候。
    送一张我最近的照片给你。
        致敬礼
                      戴笃伯
              一九六六年一月十日
