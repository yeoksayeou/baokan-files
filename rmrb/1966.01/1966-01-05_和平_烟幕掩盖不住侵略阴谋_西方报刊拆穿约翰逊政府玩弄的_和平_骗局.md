    "Peace" Smokescreen Cannot Hide the Conspiracy of Aggression
    Western Newspapers Expose the "Peace" Swindle Played by the Johnson Administration
    Editor's Note: U.S. imperialism has recently been engaged in so-called "peace-seeking" activities. A large number of high-ranking officials in Washington have been dispatched, chanting "peace" sutras and carrying "peace talk" proposals, running around everywhere, pretending to be eager to "peacefully resolve" the Vietnam issue. Lackeys, brokers, and all sorts of monsters have emerged, either echoing, harmonizing, assisting, or cheering, and the clamor of "peace" has reached an unprecedented peak for a time. This has made some well-intentioned people half-believing and half-doubting, is it possible that U.S. imperialism can really lay down its butcher knife and stop the aggression?
    However, how can the tricks played by the Johnson administration deceive discerning people? Even many Western newspapers have exposed its illusions, pointing out (although often implicitly) that the Johnson administration is merely spreading a "peace" smokescreen to cover up its conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam; the "peace" activities currently being carried out by the United States are merely the prelude to intensifying military action. They also pointed out that the "unconditional negotiations" clamored by the Johnson administration are actually negotiations on American terms, and the American goal is to permanently divide Vietnam.
    The Johnson administration has played various "peace" swindles more than once, and it has long been proven that this is merely the alternate use of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary two-handed tactics. If the war cannot be won, it will engage in a "peace talk" swindle, and if the "peace talk" swindle is exposed, it will expand the war again. Whether it is "peace talks" or expanding the war, the goal is to permanently occupy South Vietnam. Moreover, whenever it wants to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam, it will play a "peace" trick, which has become a rule. Now, it is once again using this old trick. However, as the Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* said, "All the deceptive means of the U.S. aggressor clique are bound to fail."

            Johnson Prepares to Wage War More Fiercely
    The U.S. *Wall Street Journal* published a report on December 30 by its correspondent William Beecher from Washington, writing:
    Regardless of how the Hanoi regime reacts to the U.S. suspension of bombing of North Vietnamese targets, the Johnson administration is preparing to submit two requests to Congress next month for increased personnel and increased funding in order to wage war more fiercely if necessary.
    First, the government will submit a request for tens of billions of dollars to obtain funds to pay for bombs and bombers that are already in production. Second, the government will submit a large new budget that, in addition to requesting more money to purchase weapons, may also request a further expansion of the armed forces through conscription rather than through a large-scale mobilization of reserves and the National Guard.
    Highly placed individuals believe that suspending the bombing and preparing to strengthen military forces and the explorations conducted by U.S. diplomats in Warsaw and the Vatican, etc., are Johnson's brilliant strategies of governance.
    But if Hanoi passes up the opportunity for peace talks, then the president will largely disarm domestic and foreign critics who have expressed doubts about whether he sincerely wants to resolve the issue through negotiations.
    In addition, increasing the military budget request will also help satisfy the hardliners who are demanding an expanded war effort.
    Shortly after Congress convenes on January 10, it is estimated that Johnson will submit an urgent request to increase the allocation for the current fiscal year ending June 30 by at least $7 billion, and possibly much more.
    Although the total amount of the new budget remains unknown, there is no doubt that it will call for more combat personnel and much more weaponry.
    There are currently approximately 175,000 U.S. combat troops in Vietnam; current plans call for increasing this force to approximately 210,000 in the coming months, and much more later. Two additional divisions have been alerted that they may soon be sent to Vietnam, possibly before spring, in order to participate in a new U.S.-South Vietnamese offensive if peace talks fail.

                  "Peace" Activities are Prelude to Intensified Military Action
    The British *Times* published a report from Paris on January 1 by its correspondent dated December 31, writing:
    The French are skeptical of these diplomatic (peace) actions (of the United States), and they fear that these actions may be the prelude to the United States intensifying its military action.

                  Reaching War Preparation Through "Seeking Peace"
    The British *Sunday Telegraph* published an article by Brooke-Shepherd titled: *The Greatest Show on Earth*, writing:
    President Johnson has shown the world an unparalleled spectacle with his multifaceted public peace offensive on the Vietnam issue—Texas ranch-style diplomacy, or, more precisely, Barnum's Circus.
    After the United States has probed for several months, with methods that are secretive and results that are ineffective, what does this busyness in the White House mean? One thing that it certainly does not mean, at least not yet, is serious negotiations with Hanoi or Beijing.
    The current clamor is so loud precisely because the content is so empty, so why be so enthusiastic about it?
    So far, two explanations have been put forward. They say that either the President is really determined to make peace, or he is cunningly preparing for a bigger war, and therefore this entire approach is just a massive campaign to win over the masses.
    In fact, in modern conflicts, there are few examples where "talking" and "fighting" are not so inextricably linked. The American policy has consistently been based on this premise since they first bombed North Vietnam eight months ago.
    Here, through the first aspect, seeking peace, we reach the second aspect, preparing for war. There is no doubt that, assuming that Hanoi ignores the deafening peace proposals (Washington's plan still assumes that Hanoi will ignore them), the American military screw is prepared to be tightened again by a decisive few turns in the new year. This includes increasing ground troops to 350,000 or even 500,000, quietly moving the bombing of targets in North Vietnam closer to the capital, and taking action against Viet Cong supply routes and sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia.

                  The United States Wants to Conduct "Peace Talks" on Its Own Terms
    The French *Le Figaro* published a commentary on December 30 titled *Vietnam: The American Diplomatic Offensive*, writing:
    Since the revelation of Pillat's probe in Hanoi and Rusk-Fanfani's correspondence on December 17, the Vietnam conflict seems to have taken on a new face. The gradual military escalation has stopped for a period of time, and a gradual diplomatic escalation has emerged.
    People have this feeling about these sudden diplomatic activities: the United States, before taking a new step in the gradual escalation—this time this step is likely to lead to a direct confrontation between China and the United States—intends to explore all possibilities for peace, to explore a peace talk, but this is a peace talk to be conducted on its own terms. Therefore, the United States wants to unambiguously warn its opponents that if they do not take this opportunity to step down, they will take risks.

                  The United States' "Peace" Sincerity is Doubtful
    The French *Nation* published an article by Michelet on December 31 titled *The Race of American Ambassadors: Peace or "Great Escalation" in Vietnam?*, writing:
    The largest peace offensive launched since the start of the Second Indochina War is currently in full swing. It is rare for American diplomacy to be mobilized like this today. The White House clearly wants—although it does not say so—to show the world that the United States is sparing no effort to peacefully resolve a crisis that has been going on for too long.
    However, many observers, even observers across the Atlantic, express doubts about this.
    At worst, the massive American diplomatic activities can only show its "sincerity" and reveal the "malice" of its opponents to the world, especially to the American people. Its opponents have secretly anticipated that if they refuse to negotiate, they will be punished even more severely. Some signs indicate that this assumption cannot be ruled out.

    "Negotiations" are to Maintain "Two Vietnams"
    The French *Paris Today* published an article by Tabouis, writing:
    President Johnson's "peace offensive" has appeared like fireworks... Is it a real peace offensive, or the final psychological trick before deciding to extend the conflict to the whole of Vietnam and even China!
    In fact, Harriman, like Goldberg, who visited the Pope, or Teller, the US Ambassador to Moscow, has been ordered to make legal and diplomatic interpretations of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina. That is, the United States agrees to return to this agreement, provided that people recognize that it is not the fault of the United States that the agreement has not been complied with—the opponents and some partners of the United States happen to deny this. From this point of view, Washington advocates maintaining the state of two Vietnams: this is not a basis that is easily accepted by Hanoi.
  Final Attempt Before Launching a Large-Scale War
    West German *Sunday World* wrote on January 2:
    Are these signs indicating a period of peace talks? Or, are these American peace actions the final attempt before launching a massive military effort? This military effort will have all the flavor of a large-scale war and will exceed previous limits. We do not know. In the past, many roads have been prepared for future developments, and it is not easy to take a new road in the future. (Attached image)
    Hello, another "peace" tune and it'll be just about right!

### “和平”烟幕掩盖不住侵略阴谋  西方报刊拆穿约翰逊政府玩弄的“和平”骗局

专栏：外论摘要

    “和平”烟幕掩盖不住侵略阴谋
    西方报刊拆穿约翰逊政府玩弄的“和平”骗局
    编者按：美帝国主义近来大搞所谓“寻求和平”的活动。华盛顿的高级官员大批出动，口念“和平”法经，手拿“和谈”方案，到处奔走，做出一副急于想要“和平解决”越南问题的样子。走卒掮客，牛鬼蛇神，纷纷出笼，或传声，或唱和，或帮腔，或喝采，“和平”的喧嚷一时达到了空前的高峰。这使得有一些好心人将信将疑，难道美帝国主义真有可能放下屠刀，停止侵略？
    但是，约翰逊政府玩弄的把戏，怎么能骗得了明眼人呢？连西方的许多报刊，也纷纷拆穿了它的西洋镜，指出（虽然常常是含蓄的）约翰逊政府不过是在散布一种“和平”烟幕，以掩盖它扩大侵越战争的阴谋；美国正在进行的“和平”活动，不过是加紧军事行动的序幕。它们还指出，约翰逊政府大叫大嚷的“无条件谈判”，实际上是要按美国的条件谈判，美国的目的是要永久分裂越南。
    约翰逊政府不止一次玩弄过形形色色的“和平”骗局，而且早就证明这不过是美帝国主义反革命两手的交替使用。战争打不赢，就搞一下“和谈”骗局，“和谈”骗局戳穿了，就又扩大战争。“和谈”也好，扩大战争也好，目的都是为了长期霸占南越。而且每当它要把侵越战争升一级，就要玩弄一通“和平”花招，这已成为一种规律了。现在，它又在施展这种故伎。但是，正如越南《人民报》所说的，“美国侵略集团的一切欺骗手段一定失败”。外论摘要
            约翰逊准备更猛烈地进行战争
  美国《华尔街日报》十二月三十日发表了该报记者威廉·比彻发自华盛顿的一篇报道，写道：
    不管河内政权对美国暂停对北越目标的轰炸作何反应，约翰逊政府准备在下个月向国会提出增加人员和增加经费的两项要求，以便在必要时，更猛烈地进行战争。
    首先，政府将提出一项成百亿美元的要求，以取得经费来支付已经在生产中的炸弹和轰炸机的费用。其次，政府将提出一个庞大的新预算，除了要求得到更多的钱来购买武器以外，可能还要求通过征兵而不是通过大规模动员后备队和国民警卫队来进一步扩大武装部队。
    地位很高的人士认为，暂停轰炸以及准备加强军事力量和美国外交官在华沙和梵蒂冈等地进行的探索等是约翰逊的治国妙计。
    但是如果河内放过和谈的机会，那么总统就会在很大程度上使国内外的批评者失去武器，因为这些人对他是否真诚地想通过谈判解决曾表示怀疑。
    此外，增加军事预算要求也有助于使那些要求扩大进行战争的努力的强硬派感到满意。
    在国会一月十日开会后不久，估计约翰逊将提出紧急要求，给六月三十日结束的本财政年度至少增拨七十亿美元，可能还要多得多。
    虽然新预算的总数仍然不得而知，毫无疑问，它将要求增加战斗人员和多得多的武器。
    现在在越南的美国战斗人员大约有十七万五千人；目前的计划要求在今后几个月内把这支部队增加到约二十一万人，以后还要多得多。另外两个师已经得到提醒可能很快开往越南，可能在春天以前，以便如果和谈不成，就参加美国—南越的新攻势。
                  “和平”活动是加紧军事行动序幕
    英国《泰晤士报》一月一日登载了该报记者十二月三十一日发自巴黎的一则报道，写道：
    法国人对于（美国的）这些外交（和平）行动持怀疑态度，他们担心这些行动可能是美国加紧军事行动的序幕。
                  通过“谋求和平”达到准备战争
    英国《星期日电讯报》一月二日刊登了布鲁克—谢泼德的一篇文章，题为：《在全世界最大的表演》，写道：
    约翰逊总统以他在越南问题上的多方面的公开和平攻势向全世界显示了无与伦比的壮观景象——得克萨斯州牧场表演式的外交，或者说得更恰当些，是巴纳姆的马戏。
    在美国试探了几个月，方法是诡秘的，结果也是无效的之后，白宫的这一忙碌意味着什么呢？绝不意味着的一件事情，至少是还没有意味到的一件事是同河内或北京进行认真的谈判。
    目前的扰嚷声这样鼎沸，恰巧正是因为内容如此空洞，那么又为什么要热中于此呢？
    迄今为止人们提出了两种解释。他们说，或则是总统真的决心讲和，或则是他在狡猾地准备进行更大的战争，因此这整个的做法不过是一次大举争取群众的活动。
    事实上，在近代的冲突中，很少有“谈谈”和“打打”不是这么难解难分地牵连在一起的事例。美国人自从八个月之前第一次轰炸北越以来，他们的政策一贯地是以这种前提为基础的。
    在这里，通过头一方面，谋求和平，我们就达到了第二个方面，准备战争。毫无疑问，假定河内不理睬震耳欲聋的和平建议（华盛顿的计划设想仍然是河内将不理睬），美国的军事螺丝钉就准备在新的一年里再扭上决定性的几圈。其中包括地面部队增加到三十五万人，或甚至五十万人，把对北越的目标的轰炸悄悄地更挪近首都的地方，和对越共的供应小路和在老挝和柬埔寨的避难处采取行动。
                  美国要按它的条件进行“和谈”
    法国《费加罗报》十二月三十日以《越南：美国的外交攻势》为题刊登了一篇评论，写道：
    自从十二月十七日透露皮拉在河内的试探和腊斯克—范范尼的通信以来，越南冲突似乎出现一种新的面貌。军事的逐步升级停止一个时期，于是便出现了一种外交上的逐步升级。
    人们对这些突然的外交活动倒是有这种感觉：美国在逐步升级中跨出新的一步——这次这一步很可能会导致中美直接对峙——之前，打算试探一切和平可能性，试探一次和谈，但是这是要按它的条件进行的和谈。因此，美国想要毫不含糊地警告它的对手，如果它们不借此机会下台阶，它们就要冒风险。
                  美国“和平”诚意是令人怀疑的
    法国《民族报》十二月三十一日刊登米歇莱的文章，题为《美国大使们的竞赛：在越南是和平还是“大踏步升级？”》，写道：
    自从印度支那第二次战争开始以来发动的最大和平攻势目前在充分展开。美国外交象今天这样得以动员还是罕见的。白宫显然是要——尽管它不说——向世界表明：美国为和平解决一个为时过久的危机而不遗余力。
    然而，很多观察家，甚至大西洋彼岸的观察家，都对此表示怀疑。
    最糟糕的是，美国的大规模外交活动最终只能是显示了它的“诚意”，而向全世界、特别是向美国人民揭示了对手的“恶意”。它的对手已暗暗料到，如果拒绝谈判，自己受到的惩罚将会更加惨重。一些迹象表明，不能排除这种假定。
    “谈判”是为了维持“两个越南”
    法国《今日巴黎报》十二月三十一日刊登塔布伊的文章，写道：
    约翰逊总统的“和平攻势”象焰火一样出现了，……究竟是真正的和平攻势呢，还是决意把冲突扩及全越南乃至中国之前的最后心理计谋！
    实际上，哈里曼如同访问罗马教皇的戈德堡或者美国驻莫斯科大使特勒一样，都是受命对一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议进行法律和外交上的解释。就是说美国同意回到这一协议，条件是，要人们承认，协议未得到遵守并不是美国的错误——美国的对手和一些伙伴恰好是否认这一点。华盛顿从这一点出发，主张维持两个越南的状况：这不是一个轻易使河内接受的基础。
  发动大规模战争前的最后尝试
    西德《星期日世界报》一月二日写道：
    这些是表明一个和平谈判时期的迹象吗？或者，这些美国和平行动是不是在发动一次巨大的军事努力之前的最后尝试？这次军事努力将具有一场大规模战争的全部风味并越出以前的限度。我们不知道。过去已经为未来的许多发展准备好道路，使未来走一条新道路是不容易的。（附图片）
    哈罗，再放一支“和平”曲就差不多了！
