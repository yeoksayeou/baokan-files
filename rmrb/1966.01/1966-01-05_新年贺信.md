    New Year's Greetings
    Yin Zhensheng, Fengtai Locomotive Depot

    When I reached the machine tool group, the quitting whistle had already sounded. I saw that the machine tools in the workshop were wiped clean, and the slogans on the wall, "Deepen the campaign of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping!" and "Greet the Third Five-Year Plan with practical actions!" were all newly replaced, extremely bright and eye-catching, presenting a scene of the eve of the New Year.

    More than a dozen masters were gathered around the No. 5 planer, discussing Xiao Cui's wonderful technical performance just now, but his person was nowhere to be seen.

    I thought Xiao Cui had gone back to the dormitory after work, but the female planer operator, Xiao Wang, said to me, "Master Xiao Cui has never gone straight back to the dormitory after work. You can find him near the workshop." Master Lao Song also praised, "Xiao Cui has been single-mindedly working on innovation with everyone lately, modifying tools. He said that to welcome the New Year and lay the foundation for the Third Five-Year Plan, we must stay ahead of time!" Everyone nodded in satisfaction after hearing what Master Lao Song said.

    Xiao Cui's name is Cui Yong, a twenty-three-year-old young man. Although he has only been working for three years, he has made rapid progress due to his hard study of Chairman Mao's works and his diligent and dedicated drilling into technology.

    I turned around in the various rooms near the workshop and found him in the overhaul conference room. I saw him sitting on a stool, his eyes fixed on a stack of white paper in front of him, with a large planer blade drawn on the first page. I quietly went around behind him and shouted, "Turn off the power, stop the machine!" Xiao Cui "stood up abruptly" from his seat, turned his head and saw that it was me, and said happily, "You came at the right time, help me with something." I asked him, "What's the matter?" "Write a New Year's greeting for me."

      "Hey! Who are you writing a greeting to?"

    "I'll tell you. In order to improve the quality of locomotive parts and processing efficiency, our whole group launched a technical innovation campaign to improve tools. It was at this time that..."

    I interrupted and took over, "It was at this time that you created the thirty-millimeter 'treasure blade'."

    Xiao Cui traced the planer blade drawing with his pen, saying, "This 'treasure blade' is a 'style blade'!"

      "Style blade?" I was a bit like a monk of Zhang Er—completely baffled. Xiao Cui looked up and saw my confused expression, and explained, "Have you forgotten that the comrades from the Lanzhou Railway Bureau came to our depot to visit a few days ago? They gave us the planer blade drawings."

    I knew about the visit from the Lanzhou Railway Bureau. They came to Beijing to hold an on-site meeting of the locomotive departments and wanted to learn some advanced experience from the overhaul groups. When they saw that the planers in the machine tool group were only cutting four or five millimeters at a time, they actively introduced that their Lanzhou planers could cut eighteen millimeters at a time. Xiao Cui was surprised to hear this and immediately asked the root of the matter. The comrades from Lanzhou explained and drew, and gave Xiao Cui a planer blade drawing before leaving. Later, Xiao Cui finally succeeded in the experiment with the help of everyone. But that was eighteen millimeters. How was this thirty-millimeter planer blade created?

    Xiao Cui finished drawing the planer blade diagram and said, "First, congratulate the masters in Lanzhou. Their advanced planer blades have blossomed and borne fruit in Beijing." Xiao Cui pointed to the diagram and said, "Send this new diagram to them. I have already marked on it that by changing the front angle, changing the back angle, and enlarging the cutter body according to the diagram, the cutting depth can exceed eighteen millimeters and jump to thirty millimeters. This letter and diagram must arrive before 1966, so that this blade can be used by the masters in Lanzhou on the first day of the Third Five-Year Plan." Only then did I realize that this planer blade with a cutting depth of thirty millimeters was a product of Xiao Cui learning from the advanced and surpassing the advanced.

    I picked up my pen to write a New Year's greeting. Is this greeting to be sent to distant Lanzhou? Or to Xiao Cui by my side? I thought for a while and said to myself, "This greeting should be sent to the vanguards in the campaign of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, who are eager to help others, humble and eager to learn, dare to surpass the advanced, and greet the Third Five-Year Plan with practical actions."

### 新年贺信

    新年贺信
    丰台机务段  尹振声
    我走到机床组的时候，下班汽笛已经响过。只见车间里一台台机床擦得干干净净，墙上的标语：“深入开展比学赶帮超运动！”“以实际行动迎接第三个五年计划！”都是重新换过的，非常鲜艳夺目，呈现出一派新年前夕的景象。
    有十几位师傅围在五号刨床前，纷纷议论着刚才小崔精采的技术表演，可就是不见他的人影。
    我以为小崔下班回宿舍了，女刨床工小王对我说：“小崔师傅呀，从来没下班马上回过宿舍，你就在车间附近找吧。”老宋师傅也赞扬地说：“小崔这阵子，光是一个心眼跟大伙搞革新，改刀具，他说，迎新年，为第三个五年计划打基础，得走到时间前头啊！”大家听老宋师傅这么一说，也满意地直点头。
    小崔名叫崔勇，是个二十三岁的小伙子。别看他参加工作才三年，由于努力学习毛主席著作，对技术又苦练又肯钻，进步可快哩。
    我在车间附近各屋一转，在检修会议室找见了他。只见他坐在凳子上，双眼紧盯着面前的一叠白纸，头一页纸上画着一个大刨刀。我悄悄绕到他身后，大喊了一声：“关电门，停车！”小崔“腾”地从座上站起来，扭头一看是我，高兴地说：“您来得正好，帮咱办点事儿吧。”我问他：“什么事？”“替我写封新年贺信。”
      “嘿！给谁写贺信？”
    “我说给你听。为了提高机车配件质量和加工效率，我们全组开展了技术革新，改进刀具的活动，就在这个时候……”
    我插嘴接过来说：“就在这个时候，你创造了三十毫米的‘宝刀’。”
    小崔用笔边描那个刨刀图，边说：“这‘宝刀’可是把‘风格刀’呀！”
      “风格刀？”我有点丈二的和尚——摸不着头脑。小崔抬头看到我迷糊的神情，又解释道：“你忘了前些天，兰州局的同志来咱段参观的事，人家送给咱们的刨刀图纸。”
    兰州铁路局来参观的事我知道，那是人家来北京开机务部门现场会，顺便想跟检修各工组学点先进经验。当他们看到机床组的刨床，在刨活时吃刀量才四、五毫米，就主动介绍他们兰州的刨床一次可以刨下十八毫米。小崔一听感到惊讶，立刻追根问底，兰州的同志连讲带画，临走还送给小崔一张刨刀图纸。后来，小崔在大伙的帮助下终于试验成功啦。可那是十八毫米呀，这三十毫米的刨刀又是怎么创造的呢？
    小崔把刨刀图描好，又说：“首先祝贺兰州的师傅们，他们的先进刨刀，已经在咱们北京开花结果。”小崔指着图又说：“把这张新图给他们捎去。我已经在上面标明，改改前角度，变变后角度，刀体再按图加大，吃刀量就可以超过十八毫米，跃为三十毫米。这信和图一定在一九六六年前寄到，让这把刀能叫兰州的师傅们在第三个五年计划的第一天用上。”这时，我才知道这吃刀量三十毫米的刨刀，是小崔学先进超先进的产品。
    我提起笔来写贺信，这贺信是寄给远方的兰州？还是送给身旁的小崔？我想了想，心说：“这贺信要送给在比学赶帮超运动中，助人为乐，虚心好学，敢于超先进，以实际行动迎接第三个五年计划的尖兵们。”
