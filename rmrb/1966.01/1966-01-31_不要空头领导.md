    Leadership means taking the lead. The county Party committee is the head of a county. Every word and deed of the members of the county Party committee directly affects the grassroots cadres and the broad masses of the people. The revolutionary thought, revolutionary drive, and leadership art of the county Party committee determine the quality of the work in a county. These letters, from different parts of the country, all illustrate this point.

    Among the liberated Chinese people, there is an enormous socialist enthusiasm. We firmly believe that once the banner is raised high, the morale will be greatly boosted! Editor

    Don't Be an Empty Leader

    Jianzha County is located in a high-altitude mountainous area, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, with poor natural conditions and relatively low yields.

    Can we change the world, can we increase production? This is a long-standing question before us, and one that has not been resolved for a long time. Last year, within the county Party committee's leadership core, we studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's thought gave us tremendous strength and confidence. We must do a good job in Jianzha County, and at the same time, we formulated a construction plan. Then, the members of the county Party committee went down to the grassroots to mobilize the people of the county, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, grasping class struggle firmly, and vigorously engaging in revolutionary construction.

    For more than a year, all the comrades of the county Party committee, except for a few, have gone down to the grassroots level to stay and help production teams find ways to thoroughly change the past empty leadership of loud slogans but no actual action. As a result, the county has seen a substantial increase in production. Grain output increased by 30.1 percent compared to the year before, and oilseed production increased by 29.1 percent compared to the year before. At the same time, a large number of stable and high-yield fields have emerged. The county's grain crop yield has exceeded the highest historical level. The number of livestock increased by a net 8.84 percent compared to the year before.

    The county's traffic conditions have also greatly improved, and afforestation has achieved unprecedented success.

    Regarding these new achievements, we deeply feel that the ideological leadership of the county Party committee must be revolutionary, and must always, everywhere, and in everything follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen ideological transformation, enhance the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly, establish the lofty ambition of daring to change the world for the Party and the people, and bravely be revolutionary vanguards. Only in this way can we achieve what Chairman Mao said: discover something, invent something, create something, and advance something. In short, we have clearly realized that without the ideological revolutionization of the county Party committee's leadership, the revolutionary cause cannot develop greatly.

    领导，是带头人。县委，是一个县的头。县委成员的一言一行、一举一动，直接影响基层干部和广大人民群众。县委的革命思想、革命干劲和领导艺术，决定一个县工作的好坏。这几封信，来自全国不同的地方，都说明了这个道理。
    在解放了的中国人民中间，蕴藏着一种极大的社会主义积极性。我们深信：帅旗一旦高举，士气必能大振！　编者
    不要空头领导
    尖扎县地处高原山区，海拔二千多米，自然条件不好，产量比较低。
    能不能改天换地，能不能把产量提高？这是长期摆在我们面前、也是长期没有得到解决的问题。去年，我们在县委领导核心里边，学了毛主席著作，主席思想给了我们巨大力量和信心。我们一定要把尖扎县搞好，同时制定了建设规划。而后，县委委员分头下去发动全县人民，高举毛泽东思想红旗，大学毛主席著作，大抓阶级斗争，大搞革命建设。
    一年多来，县委同志除少数外，一律下到基层蹲点，帮助生产队想方设法，彻底改变了过去嘴上喊得响，实际不出征的空头领导。抓的结果，全县出现了大幅度增产，粮食比前年增长百分之三十点一，油料比前年增产百分之二十九点一。同时还出现了大批的稳产高产田。全县粮食作物产量，已超过历史最高水平。牲畜头数比前年净增百分之八点八四。
    全县交通状况也有很大改变，造林获得以往未曾有过的成就。
    这些新的成就，我们深切地体会到：县委领导思想要革命化，必须时时、处处、事事遵循毛主席的教导，加强思想改造，增强全心全意为人民服务的观点，树立为党为人民敢叫日月换新天的雄心壮志，勇当革命的闯将。只有这样，才能做到象毛主席所说的那样：有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。总之，我们已经清醒地意识到：没有县委领导思想革命化，革命事业就不可能大发展。
