　　United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, on the 20th, made a preposterous statement, viciously attacking China. He even nonsensically claimed that "emotionally tense individuals may suffer from mental derangement."

　　This running dog of the United States spoke incoherently, indeed somewhat resembling "mental derangement." This is probably because his ugly deeds of serving the American "peace talks" fraud have been exposed, causing him to become "emotionally tense."

    原来如此
    联合国秘书长吴丹二十日大放厥词，恶毒地攻击中国。他竟然胡说什么“情绪紧张的个人可能会神经错乱”。
    这个美国的走卒语无伦次，倒的确有点象是“神经错乱”。这大概是因为他为美国“和谈”骗局效劳的丑事被人揭露，而变得“情绪紧张”的原故罢。
