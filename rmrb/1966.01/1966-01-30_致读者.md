    To Our Readers
    The column "Doing Business for the Revolution, Managing Finance and Trade for the Revolution" has mainly discussed the understanding of financial and trade work in the previous stage, that is, the issue of recognizing financial and trade work as revolutionary work.

    Starting from this issue, discussions will revolve around the theme of "Promoting Revolutionary Spirit, Doing a Good Job in Financial and Trade Work." During this stage, we plan to focus on exploring how leading cadres and leading organs of financial and trade departments can become revolutionized, and how financial and trade workers can implement the revolutionary spirit into their business activities. For example, how to highlight politics? How to face the countryside and the masses? How to better serve production and people's lives? How can leading organs serve the grassroots? How can wholesale departments serve retail enterprises? How can leading cadres go deep into the masses and deep into reality? And so on.

    Currently, a vigorous and down-to-earth movement of increasing production and practicing economy is developing smoothly throughout the country. How can financial and trade departments use revolutionary spirit to carry out this movement within their own departments, and how can they support and promote other departments to carry out this movement? All issues that everyone believes are urgently needed to be resolved in the revolutionization of leadership and the revolutionization of enterprises can be put forward for discussion. All revolutionary spirits that everyone thinks are worth promoting can be introduced through contributions and letters. The focus can be on ideological understanding, work style, and leadership methods.

    It is hoped that leading cadres and the vast number of employees in financial and trade departments will express their opinions and views on these issues, and introduce their experiences and insights. Comrades from other departments are also welcome to contribute and write letters to introduce the advanced deeds of financial and trade workers, or to offer opinions and suggestions on financial and trade work.

    致读者
    《为革命做生意，为革命办财贸》这个专栏，前一阶段主要讨论了对财贸工作的认识，即财贸工作是革命工作的认识问题。
    从这一期起，将围绕“发扬革命精神，做好财贸工作”这个主题开展讨论。这个阶段，准备着重探讨财贸部门领导干部和领导机关如何革命化的问题，以及财贸职工如何把革命精神落实到业务活动中去的问题。譬如，如何突出政治？如何面向农村，面向大众？如何更好地为生产和人民生活服务？领导机关怎样为基层服务？批发部门怎样为零售企业服务？领导干部怎样深入群众、深入实际？等等。
    当前，在全国范围内，一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的增产节约运动正在顺利发展。财贸部门怎样用革命精神在本部门开展这一运动，怎样支持和促进其他部门开展这一运动？凡是大家认为有关领导革命化、企业革命化中迫切需要解决的问题，都可以提出讨论。大家认为值得发扬的革命精神，都可以来稿来信介绍。重点可以放在思想认识、工作作风和领导方法方面。
    希望财贸部门的领导干部和广大职工，就这些问题发表意见和看法，介绍经验和体会。也欢迎其他部门的同志来稿来信，介绍财贸职工的先进事迹，或者对财贸工作提出意见和建议。
