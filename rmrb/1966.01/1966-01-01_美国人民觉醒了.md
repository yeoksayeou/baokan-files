    The American people sounded the clarion call of battle last year. The American people’s struggle against the Johnson administration’s war of aggression against Vietnam is unfolding in a magnificent and vigorous way. The struggle of American Blacks is also developing in depth, and has begun to take the path of using violence to resist violence. These two currents of struggle are closely converging, indicating that the American people's revolutionary struggle has entered a new stage.
    Starting in early February last year, the American people's anti-Vietnam War protests and demonstrations have been developing wave upon wave. The "March on Washington" on April 17, in which 25,000 people participated, set off the first climax of the anti-war movement last year. At the end of July, when the Johnson government announced a further increase in troops to South Vietnam, more people across the United States joined the ranks of the anti-war struggle, and the momentum became stronger and stronger. In mid-October, 100,000 people in more than 40 states and nearly 100 cities across the United States held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration for three consecutive days, pushing the American people's anti-war movement to a new climax. On November 27, about 50,000 Americans from 40 states held a large demonstration around the White House in Washington. The American people's anti-war struggle is not only magnificent in scale, something that has never appeared in American history, but also some of the slogans put forward in the anti-war struggle show that more and more Americans have realized that in order to oppose the US government's policy of aggression and war policy, they must fight together with the people of the world to destroy the imperialist system. This reflects the revolutionary awakening of the American people.
    The struggle of American Blacks has been continuous throughout the year, developing from the South to the North and the West. Last August, Blacks in the Watts district of Los Angeles launched an unprecedented anti-violence struggle, taking up arms to fight against armed military police. This incident greatly shocked the American ruling group. According to American newspapers, more and more Black armed self-defense organizations are appearing across the United States. More and more Blacks have realized that peaceful means cannot achieve the goal of striving for liberation. The Johnson government is alarmed and uneasy about the re-emergence of the Watts incident.
    The American people's anti-war movement and the struggle of the vast number of American Blacks for freedom and liberation are increasingly converging. Many activists participating in the anti-war movement are veterans of the civil rights struggle. Blacks in the Watts district shouted the slogan "Vietnam and Watts are engaged in the same struggle" during the anti-violence struggle. Many Blacks have stated that they will never go to Vietnam to fight, but will stay in the local area to fight for Black rights.
    The American people's struggle has become a meaningful force in the torrent of the world's people's anti-American struggle. This shows that American imperialism is not only surrounded by the people of the world, but also that a raging fire has already been ignited under its feet. (Attached picture)
    The American people are increasingly awakening, and the anti-Vietnam War movement is booming. The picture shows young people demonstrating outside the White House to protest the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam.

    美国人民觉醒了
    美国人民在去年响亮地吹起了战斗的号角。美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵略越南战争的斗争，正在波澜壮阔地展开。美国黑人的斗争也在深入发展，并且开始走上以暴力对抗暴力的道路。这两股斗争潮流密切地汇合，表明美国人民革命斗争进入了一个新阶段。
    从去年二月初开始，美国人民反对侵越战争的抗议示威活动，一直在一浪接一浪地发展着。四月十七日有两万五千人参加的“华盛顿进军”，掀起了去年反战运动的第一个高潮。七月末约翰逊政府宣布进一步增兵南越，美国各地有更多的人民群众投入了反战斗争的行列，声势越来越大。十月中旬，美国四十多个州、近一百个城市的十万群众举行了全国范围的、持续三天的空前大示威，把美国人民的反战运动推向一个新的高潮。十一月二十七日，来自四十个州的约五万名美国人，在华盛顿白宫周围举行大示威。美国人民的反战斗争，不但规模壮阔是美国历史上所从未出现过的，而且反战斗争中提出的一些口号，显示了越来越多的美国人民已经认识到，要反对美国政府的侵略政策和战争政策，必须同世界人民一起为摧毁帝国主义制度而斗争。这反映美国人民的革命已觉醒。
    美国黑人的斗争，一年来一直连绵不断，从南部发展到北部和西部。去年八月，洛杉矶市瓦茨区黑人掀起规模空前的抗暴斗争，拿起武器同武装军警进行战斗。这个事件使得美国统治集团大为震惊。据美国报纸透露，美国各地黑人武装自卫组织越来越多。越来越多的黑人认识到靠和平手段是不能实现争取解放的目的。约翰逊政府正在为瓦茨区事件的再次出现而惊惶不安。
    美国人民的反战运动和美国广大黑人争取自由和解放的斗争，愈益紧密地汇合在一起。参加反战运动的很多积极分子，是民权斗争中的老战士。瓦茨区黑人在抗暴斗争中喊出了“越南和瓦茨区从事同一个斗争”的口号。不少黑人表示，他们决不去越南打仗，而要留在当地为黑人权利而战。
    美国人民的斗争已经成为世界人民的反美斗争洪流中的一支有意义的力量。这表明，美帝国主义不仅处于世界人民的包围中，而且在它的脚下也已经烧起了熊熊的烈火。（附图片）
