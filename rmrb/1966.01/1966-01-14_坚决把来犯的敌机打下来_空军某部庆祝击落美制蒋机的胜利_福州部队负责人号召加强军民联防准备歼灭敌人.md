    According to Xinhua News Agency, 13th. An air force unit of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army solemnly held a victory celebration and award ceremony in a certain location in East China today, warmly celebrating the significant victory of shooting down a U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft on the afternoon of January 9th, and rewarding personnel who made meritorious contributions in the battle.
    Han Xianchu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army Fuzhou Troops, and responsible persons from local Party, government, and military attended the meeting.
    The conference began amidst the solemn strains of the national anthem. Deputy Chief of the General Staff Han Xianchu, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense, read the commendation order issued by Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao to the units that made meritorious contributions in the battle. Following this, Li Shian, the responsible person of the Air Force participating in the battle, read the list of units and individuals who received awards for their meritorious service in this operation, and presented the certificates of merit to them. Responsible persons of local garrison troops and local Party and government organs presented two award banners to the units that made meritorious contributions in the battle.
    Pi Dingjun, the responsible person of the Fuzhou Troops, spoke at the conference, warmly congratulating on the victory of this battle. He demanded that all commanders and fighters of the frontline troops diligently learn from the participating troops, study their living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, daring to fight and to engage in hand-to-hand combat.
    He then strongly condemned the U.S. imperialism's frantic expansion of its war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina, its attempt to impose the war on the people of our country, and its instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to continuously carry out harassment and sabotage activities against our coastal areas from the air and sea. He emphasized that although the enemy has suffered heavy blows time and again, it will never be reconciled to defeat and will continue to make a last-ditch struggle. He called on the commanders and fighters of the army, navy, and air force to be constantly prepared, stand in strict formation, further strengthen joint army-people defense, and be ready at any time to deal a destructive blow to any invading enemy.
    Responsible persons of local Party and government organs spoke at the conference, praising the combat troops for fighting well, fiercely, and accurately, and for once again making meritorious contributions to the motherland and the people. He said that the victory of this air battle once again demonstrated the power of the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. He emphasized that the people of our coastal areas must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to carry out production and construction, strengthen the "three implementations" of the militia, better learn the revolutionary spirit of the People's Liberation Army, Dazhai, and Daqing, and fully support the troops in winning more victories from all aspects such as manpower and materials.
    Li Chunguang, the representative of the personnel who made meritorious contributions in the battle, also spoke at the conference, expressing that in the future, they must even more firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to advance, while conceit makes one lag behind," further emphasize politics, and constantly enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops. Regardless of whether the enemy comes by day or by night, from high altitude or low altitude, with or without pilots, we will certainly cooperate with fraternal troops to resolutely shoot down any invading enemy aircraft.
