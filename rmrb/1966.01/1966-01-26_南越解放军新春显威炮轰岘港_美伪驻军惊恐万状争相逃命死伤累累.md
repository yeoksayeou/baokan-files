    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 25th -- News from Saigon: On the morning of January 25th, the South Vietnam Liberation Army launched a fierce artillery bombardment against the heavily defended Da Nang base of the American aggressor troops. The enemy garrison, which had been repeatedly attacked by the Liberation Army, were like startled birds, panicking and suffering heavy casualties.
    Initial reports from Western news agencies say that thirty American aggressor troops and South Vietnamese puppet troops were killed or wounded, about half of whom were American aggressors. According to Western news agencies, under the cover of darkness, the Liberation Army cleverly moved into attacking positions. Starting at 00:40, a string of artillery shells pierced the night sky and hit the Da Nang airport, the Norrman airport three kilometers away, and the camp of the 9th Regiment of the US Marine Corps south of the airport. The bombardment lasted for about forty minutes. Many artillery shells hit the oil storage area of ​​Da Nang airport, and three refueling trucks were destroyed. Some artillery shells exploded in the barracks of the US Navy engineers at Norrman Airport, and the enemy was awakened from their dreams and fled for their lives in chaos. Many American aggressors were killed and wounded.
    It is reported that the "Hawk" missile launch site of the American aggressor troops in Da Nang and the headquarters of the South Vietnamese puppet army's First Military Region were also hit by artillery shells.
    After successfully completing their mission, the South Vietnam Liberation Army safely withdrew. The disoriented enemy hurriedly ordered helicopters to drop flares everywhere and sent out some puppet troops to "search." However, it is reported that they did not even find a shadow of the Liberation Army.
    According to reports, on January 24, the South Vietnam Liberation Army also attacked the enemy stronghold of Tai Ren, more than 40 kilometers southwest of Saigon, and bombarded the Donghe US Air Force facility, 12 kilometers northwest of Guangyi City.

    新华社二十五日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军二十五日凌晨向美国侵略军重兵防守的岘港基地发动猛烈炮轰。曾经遭到解放军多次奇袭的守敌犹如惊弓之鸟，恐慌万状，死伤累累。
    西方通讯社初步消息说，三十名美国侵略军和南越伪军被打死、打伤，其中约一半是美国侵略者。据西方通讯社报道，解放军在夜幕的掩护下，机灵地运动进入攻击阵地，从零时四十分开始，联珠般的炮弹划破夜空，射向岘港机场、三公里外的诺曼机场和机场南面美国海军陆战队第九团的营地，轰击持续了约四十分钟。岘港机场的贮油区中了许多炮弹，三辆加油车被击毁。一些炮弹在诺曼机场美国海军工兵的营房里开了花，敌人从睡梦中惊醒，争相逃命，一片混乱。许多美国侵略者被打死打伤。
    据报道，美国侵略军在岘港的“隼式”导弹发射场和南越伪军第一军区总部也挨了炮弹。
    南越解放军胜利完成任务后，安全转移。被打得蒙头转向的敌人慌忙命令直升飞机到处乱扔照明弹，并且派出一些伪军出来“搜索”。但是，据报道，他们连解放军的影子也没有找到。
    另据报道，越南南方解放军二十四日还进攻了西贡西南四十多公里的太仁敌军据点和炮轰广义市西北十二公里的东河美国空军设施。
