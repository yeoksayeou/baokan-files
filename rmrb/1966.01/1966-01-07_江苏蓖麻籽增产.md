    Jiangsu Province's supply and marketing cooperatives purchased more than five times the amount of castor seeds last year compared to the previous year.
    In the past, only a few areas in Jiangsu Province, such as Xuzhou and Huaiyin, had the habit of growing castor beans. Last year, people's communes in many areas north and south of the Yangtze River regarded castor bean cultivation as an important sideline occupation and planted many castor beans. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied more than 500,000 jin of seeds to various communes and teams. During the castor bean harvest, many supply and marketing cooperatives set up additional purchasing points and made door-to-door purchases, providing convenience for the masses to sell castor beans.

    江苏蓖麻籽增产
    江苏省各地供销社去年收购的蓖麻籽比前年增加了五倍多。
    过去，江苏省只有徐州、淮阴等少数地区有种植蓖麻的习惯。去年，大江南北许多地区的人民公社都把种植蓖麻作为一项重要的副业，种植了很多蓖麻。省供销社供给各地社队五十多万斤种子。在蓖麻籽收获期间，许多供销社增设收购点，上门收购，为群众出售蓖麻籽提供了方便。　（据新华社讯）
