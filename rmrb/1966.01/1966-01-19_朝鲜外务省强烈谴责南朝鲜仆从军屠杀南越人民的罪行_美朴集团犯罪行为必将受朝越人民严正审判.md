    Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs Strongly Condemns the Crimes of South Korean Puppet Troops in Slaughtering the South Vietnamese People
    The Criminal Acts of the US-Park Clique Will Inevitably Be Sternly Judged by the Korean and Vietnamese People
    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 17th, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of the US imperialists in directing the South Korean puppets to implement a "scorched earth policy" in South Vietnam. The statement pointed out that the "scorched earth policy" implemented by US imperialism in South Vietnam and its intensified acts of aggressive war thoroughly expose that their so-called "peace offensive" is merely a mask for further expanding the war.
    The statement said that on December 22, 1965, under the command of the US military, the South Korean puppet army attacked Xinjiang Village in Pingding Province, South Vietnam, and committed an inhumane criminal atrocity of slaughtering fifty unarmed peaceful residents. This is a serious provocation against the peace-loving people of Asia and the world.
    The statement said that US imperialism and the Park Chung-hee clique must bear full responsibility for the crimes they have committed in South Vietnam and all the consequences arising therefrom, and will inevitably be sternly judged by all the Korean and Vietnamese people. The statement said that the Korean government and people fully support the statement issued by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 6, 1966, and the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 11.
    The statement called on the South Korean people to unite with the people in the northern half of the Republic to resolutely demand the immediate return of the South Korean puppet troops who have been dragged to South Vietnam, and to resolutely struggle to smash the new conspiracy of US imperialism and the Park Chung-hee clique to send additional puppet troops.
    The statement called on the South Korean officers and soldiers who betrayed their country and nation and were forcibly dragged to South Vietnam by US imperialism to carry out aggression, to launch a tenacious struggle, stop the criminal life of serving as mercenaries for US imperialism, turn their guns on US imperialism and the puppet clique, return to their hometowns, and stand on the side of the Vietnamese people who are carrying out a just and heroic struggle.

    朝鲜外务省强烈谴责南朝鲜仆从军屠杀南越人民的罪行
    美朴集团犯罪行为必将受朝越人民严正审判
    据新华社平壤十七日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人十七日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义指使南朝鲜傀儡在越南南方实行“焦土政策”的滔天罪行。声明指出，美帝国主义在越南南方实行的“焦土政策”和强化侵略战争的行为，彻底地暴露出它们叫嚷的“和平攻势”只不过是为了进一步扩大战争的假面具。
    声明说，一九六五年十二月二十二日，在美军的指挥下，南朝鲜傀儡军袭击了越南南方平定省新江村，干出了屠杀五十名赤手空拳的和平居民的惨无人道的犯罪暴行。这是对亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的严重挑衅行为。
    声明说，美帝国主义和朴正熙集团必须对他们在南越犯下的罪行和由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任，并且必将受到全体朝鲜人民和越南人民的严正审判。声明说，朝鲜政府和人民完全支持越南民主共和国外交部发言人一九六六年一月六日发表的声明，以及越南民主共和国外交部一月十一日发表的声明。
    声明号召：南朝鲜人民应该同共和国北半部人民一起，为坚决要求立即送回被拉往越南南方的南朝鲜伪军而斗争，为粉碎美帝国主义和朴正熙集团企图再次增派伪军的新阴谋而坚决斗争。
    声明号召，背叛自己的国家和民族、被美帝国主义强迫拉到越南南方进行侵略的南朝鲜官兵，应该展开顽强斗争，停止充当美帝国主义雇佣军的罪恶生活，把枪口转向美帝国主义和傀儡集团，回到自己的故乡，站到正在开展正义的英勇斗争的越南人民一边。
