　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has achieved bumper harvests in animal husbandry for seven consecutive years, had another bumper harvest of livestock products last year. From January to November last year, rural and pastoral communes in the autonomous region sold more than 210,000 head of oxen and horses to the state, doubling the figure for the same period last year. More than 2.8 million head of edible cattle and sheep were sold, an increase of one-third over the same period last year. The output of livestock products such as hides, wool, frozen meat, fresh eggs, sausage casings, mane and tail hair, and dairy products also exceeded the highest historical output level of the previous year. Responsible persons from relevant departments said that the various types of wool produced by the autonomous region last year could be used to make a set of woolen clothes for more than one million people, using only one-third of the total output.
　　The growth of animal husbandry products has promoted the development of national industry in this region. Now, in addition to the modern wool textile factory and carpet factory built in Hohhot, other cities and pastoral towns in the autonomous region have also established processing industries such as leather, dairy products, meat, hides and furs, bone glue, knitwear, and pharmaceuticals. At present, the products produced by Inner Mongolia's livestock product processing industry can not only meet the needs of people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region and the domestic market, but can also supply the foreign market. The Inner Mongolia cashmere, which is used for weaving high-grade woolen fabrics, ranks first in the country in terms of output. The total output of cashmere last year increased by more than 10 percent compared with the same period of the previous year.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Telegram: Xinjiang has made significant achievements in improving sheep breeds. Currently, fine wool sheep and improved sheep account for one-third of the total number of sheep in Xinjiang, making it a region with the fastest progress, the largest quantity, and the best quality of improved sheep in China.
　　The fine wool sheep and improved sheep in Xinjiang have many advantages: this kind of sheep has a lot of fine wool, which is of high economic value; large size and weight; high milk production; high twin lamb production; strong disease resistance; cold resistance, drought resistance, and resistance to roughage; docile temperament, good for grazing; suitable for zoned grazing, and easy to implement scientific management. These advantages have been accepted by the vast number of herdsmen. At present, in more than 140 people's communes in the region that are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, in addition to the communes that are cultivating some local excellent breeds such as big-tailed sheep, lambskin sheep, and semi-coarse wool sheep, they are also vigorously carrying out sheep breed improvement work with fine wool sheep as the direction.
　　Xinjiang is a region that started sheep breed improvement work relatively early. As early as 1954, China's first fine wool sheep breed—Xinjiang Wool-Meat Dual-Purpose Fine Wool Sheep—was cultivated. Subsequently, the state successively established thirteen stud farms throughout Xinjiang and established more than one hundred sheep artificial insemination stations. After the people's commune-ization, Xinjiang's sheep breed improvement work entered a new stage of development. Now there are more than 960 artificial insemination stations run by communes and production teams in the region. More than 5,000 breeding technicians working in these stations are all poor and lower-middle herdsmen trained locally. In the past two years, more than three million sheep have been improved every year.

  　内蒙古畜产品又获丰收
    新疆改良绵羊进展快、数量大、质量好
    新华社呼和浩特电　连续七年获得畜牧业丰收的内蒙古自治区，去年畜产品又获得丰收。去年一至十一月份，自治区农村、牧区公社出售给国家的耕牛、耕马有二十一万多头，比前年同期增长一倍，出售的食用牛羊二百八十多万头，比前年同期增长三分之一。皮张、绒毛、冻肉、鲜蛋、肠衣、鬃尾、乳制品等畜产品的产量，也都超过了历史上产量最高的前年的水平。有关部门负责人说，去年自治区生产的各种绒毛，只用其中的三分之一就可供一百多万人每人做一套毛料衣服。
    畜牧业产品的增长，促进了这个地区民族工业的发展。现在，除呼和浩特市兴建了现代化的毛纺织厂和地毯厂外，自治区其他城市和牧区城镇，也建立起皮革、乳品、肉类、皮毛、骨胶、针织和制药等加工工业。目前，内蒙古畜产品加工工业生产的产品，不仅能满足自治区各族人民和国内市场的需要，还可以供应国外市场。用于纺织高级呢绒的内蒙古山羊绒，产量居全国第一位。去年山羊绒的总产量比前年同期增长了百分之十以上。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆的绵羊品种改良工作取得了重大成绩。目前自治区的细毛羊和改良羊已占全疆绵羊总数的三分之一，成为我国改良绵羊进展最快、数量最大、质量最好的一个地区。
    新疆改良的细毛羊和改良羊有很多优点：这种羊毛多毛细，经济价值高；个大体重；产奶多；产双羔多；抗病力强；耐寒、耐旱、耐粗放；性情温驯，好放牧；适应划区轮放，便于实行科学管理。这些优点已为广大牧民所接受，现在，全疆一百四十多个以牧为主的人民公社中，除了培育本地一些优良品种如大尾羊、羔皮羊、半粗毛羊的公社外，都在大力进行以细毛羊为方向的绵羊品种改良工作。
    新疆是开展绵羊品种改良工作较早的地区。早在一九五四年就育成我国第一个良种细毛羊——新疆毛肉兼用细毛羊。随后，国家先后在全疆各地建立了十三个种羊场，兴办了一百多个绵羊人工授精站。人民公社化以后，新疆的绵羊品种改良工作进入新的发展阶段。现在全区社、队自办的人工授精站已有九百六十多座，在这些站里工作的五千多名配种技术人员，都是就地训练出来的贫苦牧民。近两年来，每年改良的绵羊都在三百万只以上。
