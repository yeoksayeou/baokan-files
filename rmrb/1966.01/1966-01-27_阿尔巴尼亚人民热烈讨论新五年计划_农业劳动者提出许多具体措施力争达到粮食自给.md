	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana: The Albanian people are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party and the government, actively participating in the discussion and formulation of the national Fourth Five-Year Plan, and, in the spirit of self-reliance, have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals and concrete measures for increasing production and practicing economy.
	Since the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and the Council of Ministers issued a proclamation in October last year calling on the people to participate in the discussion and formulation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970) for the development of economy and culture, more than 24,400 people in Tirana have participated in this discussion, putting forward more than 26,700 suggestions, most of which are practical and feasible. Many suggestions have been put into practice. In the course of enthusiastically discussing the draft of the new Five-Year Plan, agricultural laborers have put forward a series of concrete measures for increasing grain production and striving to achieve food self-sufficiency.
	In the course of the discussion, the Albanian People's Army troops put forward many measures for vigorously developing the production of grain, meat, and potatoes, and decided to achieve complete self-sufficiency in grain, meat, and vegetables for the entire army by the end of 1970.
