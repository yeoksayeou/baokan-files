    A soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought possesses the greatest courage and the strongest backbone.
    In the revolutionary war years filled with gunfire, and in the socialist construction period of earth-shaking changes, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured countless revolutionary warriors of great wisdom and courage! They have used their heroic actions to compose magnificent poems. Today, the image of another staunch heroic warrior stands before us. Mai Xiande, the engine room soldier of the "Sea Hero Boat," sustained a serious head injury, with cerebrospinal fluid leaking, yet he persisted in fighting for as long as three hours. Only a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought could possess such a revolutionary hard bone!
        A Combat Spirit of Unyielding Advance
    The event occurred on August 6, 1965.
    At dawn, the night sea was vast, with fishing lights dotting the surface. The "Sea Hero Boat" and its sister vessels were vigilantly patrolling the sea, performing escort duties for fishing operations.
    At that moment, the US-made Chiang Kai-shek ships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" sneaked into the fishing grounds near Dongshan Island again. A surge of anger erupted in the hearts of the sailors, and they expressed that they would severely punish the enemy, protect the lives and property of the people, and avenge the wronged fishermen.
    Engine room soldier Mai Xiande stood tall at the main engine control panel, his eyes fixed on the instruments. Suddenly, the bell rang in the engine room, and the commander issued the order to engage. He pulled the control lever, and the gunboat, with its head held high, cut through the waves straight toward the enemy ships.
    Under the illumination of the blue indicator lights, a sentence written on the small blackboard on the front of the engine room clearly caught Mai Xiande's eye: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, surmount every difficulty to win victory." At this moment, as battle was imminent, Chairman Mao's teachings made him feel especially close and filled his whole body with boundless strength.
    Mai Xiande, the son of a boatman, harbored deep affection for the motherland's seas. He would never forget the heinous crimes committed by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the seas of the motherland. Love for the people, hatred for the enemy, the determination to kill enemies and perform meritorious service for the country, and to avenge the class brothers all surged into his heart. His bright eyes widened, his hands gripped the control lever tightly, and only one thought was in his mind: "Resolutely annihilate the enemy!"
      The "Sea Hero Boat," together with its sister boats, displayed the spirit of "seeing red with bayonets," and like a sharp sword, bravely thrust into the enemy formation, splitting the enemy's two-ship formation into two isolated vessels. Our heroic fleet first seized the enemy ship "Zhangjiang," and strings of angry shells accurately flew towards the enemy ship, the firelight reddening half the sea and sky.
  The "Zhangjiang" was set ablaze with a raging fire. Listening to the loud cannon fire, the engine room soldiers excitedly made gestures to each other, indicating they would resolutely take it down!
    As the battle was raging fiercely, the rear-left engine of the "Sea Hero Boat's" main engine room unexpectedly stalled. Mai Xiande immediately ran over to help start the machine. At that moment, a piece of shrapnel struck Mai Xiande's right forehead, lodging itself in the frontal lobe near the temple on the left side. He immediately lost consciousness and fell to the engine room floor.
    Enemy shells could damage a soldier's body, but they could not destroy the determination to kill the enemy and the fighting will of a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Mai Xiande thought only of victory in the battle. When the deputy instructor bandaged his wound, he regained consciousness. But he could not make a sound, and his legs could not support him. He was anxious, pushing the deputy instructor with his right hand and laboriously pointing to the machine with his left hand. His comrades immediately understood Mai Xiande's meaning: "The machine, the most important thing now is to take care of the machine!" The deputy instructor held Mai Xiande in his arms and said excitedly, "Be obedient, obey orders!" Mai Xiande obediently let them bandage him. However, as soon as the deputy instructor turned to leave the engine room, he pressed his left hand against the machine next to him and struggled to his feet. With astonishing willpower, he was fulfilling the determination he had expressed in his notes on studying Chairman Mao's works: "As long as I am still breathing, I will definitely fight on!"
    Mai Xiande returned to his combat post. He found that the rear-left engine had already been started, and the machine was running normally. So he went to the forward engine room. From the rear engine room to the forward engine room, there was only an elliptical hatch forty centimeters wide and sixty centimeters high. Even for someone with intact limbs and a clear mind, it would not be easy to crawl through. However, Mai Xiande, with a severe head injury, crawled into the forward engine room, and as soon as he got there, he immediately began to check the machines without stopping.
    Under the intense bombardment of our naval vessels, the enemy ship "Zhangjiang" was on the verge of destruction, and the enemy ship "Jianmen" timidly hid in the distance, firing potshots at us. The blood on Mai Xiande's forehead stuck to his eyelids and eyelashes, hindering his vision. But, relying on his "night tiger" skills honed in peacetime, he stubbornly held on to his combat post. In the violently rocking engine room, he moved back and forth, groping and checking each pipe, each valve, each screw. He knew that the enemy ships had not been completely annihilated and the battle could not stop.
    Time passed moment by moment. Was it because too much blood had been lost? Was it because the shrapnel lodged in his forehead had tormented him for too long? Mai Xiande's steps faltered, and his movements became sluggish. But his will to fight remained very strong. Look, even under these circumstances, he was actually able to find a screw, only the size of a thumb, that had been loosened by the shock among dozens of pipes and hundreds of screws; he was actually able to tighten the screw with a wrench, ensuring the normal operation of the machine. In this way, Mai Xiande, with the spirit of being unmatched and invincible, persisted in fighting for three hours. When his comrade Chen Wenyi pressed him onto a blanket and told him to lie down and rest, he held up two fingers towards Chen Wenyi and then passed out. It is not known whether he was telling his comrade that the two main engines in the forward engine room were operating normally, or whether he was asking if the two enemy ships had been completely sunk?…
    The enemy ships "Zhangjiang" and "Jianmen" were successively buried in the sea, and the battle ended in victory. A golden ray of sunshine shone through the window, projecting onto Mai Xiande's determined face. With unparalleled respect, Chen Wenyi gazed at his close comrade, his mind echoing Chairman Mao's teaching: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It is determined to overwhelm all enemies and never be subjugated by the enemy."
      Only By Understanding Exploitation Can One Understand Revolution
    The young sailor Mai Xiande was born into a poor boatman's family. From the time he could remember, his grandmother and parents often told him about the tragic experiences of his family for generations: the Japanese devils burned his family's boat, his grandfather was starved to death, his father suffered all kinds of oppression from the reactionaries, his mother took his older brother to flee famine everywhere, and he was just born when his hometown was bombed by enemy planes... The bitter family history, etched deeply in Mai Xiande's young heart, planted the seeds of class hatred.
    The education of the Party and the influence of the new society further made Mai Xiande understand class love and hatred. When Mai Xiande was in elementary school, his teachers told them stories of revolutionary martyrs. Mai Xiande was very moved after listening, and he asked the teacher: "The martyrs engaged in revolution for the poor. Why did the Kuomintang arrest such good people? What exactly is the Kuomintang?" After the teacher's patient explanation, he learned that the Kuomintang was the representative of the landlords and despots and was the reactionary faction that had ruled the Chinese people for a long time. When Mai Xiande was in the first year of junior high school, he learned from his textbooks how classes were formed, what exploitation of people by people was all about, and also understood the roots of his family's poverty and suffering for generations. Later, he returned home to participate in fishery production and became a militiaman. Through the education of remembering bitterness carried out by the militia battalion, he saw the scar on the right leg of the old fisherman Mai Xidi that had been shot by the Japanese devils; he also heard Zhu Shiyu accuse the Japanese invaders of shooting his mother to death and also heard the stories of blood and tears of many militiamen... He further understood that in the old society, thousands upon thousands of families, like his family, were destroyed and families were torn apart by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; thousands upon thousands of suffering people were like bitter gourds hanging on the same vine. He merged the suffering of his family with the suffering of the entire class, and the anger of hating the enemy was ignited in his chest. Soon, the militia battalion launched an activity to learn from Lei Feng, and Mai Xiande took Lei Feng as an example and began to study Chairman Mao's works. To this day, the militia battalion headquarters still retains a study note written by Mai Xiande after his study, which reads: "In the future, I will definitely listen to the Party and listen to Chairman Mao, and be a good militiaman of Chairman Mao."
    Whether he was a student or a militiaman, Mai Xiande dared to break through and act and was willing to shoulder heavy burdens for the interests of the collective. At school, once he helped the commune deliver seedlings. At that time, the wind and rain were heavy, the ditches were wide and the water was deep, and there were many water snakes. Mai Xiande was the first to volunteer to deliver them and worked in the water for nearly two hours. When he was a militiaman, no matter how tense the maritime labor was, as soon as he returned home, he carried his gun and patrolled the coast. One stormy night, he waded through chest-deep tide water and single-handedly used a boat to rescue more than 3,000 kilograms of grain from the flooded commune granary. At the critical moment when the salt fields were threatened by the tide, he joined the fishermen in a fearless battle to block the dike! Mai Xiande was a militiaman for two years and was named a "Five-Good Militiaman" for two years and received six commendations and rewards.
    In November 1963, young people enthusiastically enlisted in the army, and Mai Xiande eagerly applied to join the army three times. In one application, he wrote: The Kuomintang harmed us, Japanese imperialism harmed us in the past, and American imperialism bullies us like this. I am determined to sign up for the army. I will definitely learn from Lei Feng and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!
    Mai Xiande was finally approved to join the army. His parents and fellow villagers came to see him off. His father exhorted him: "We have suffered for generations. When you get to the army, listen to the leaders and work hard!" Militia battalion commander Mai Kefu also exhorted him: "When you get to the army, especially study the article 'Serve the People'. We are joining the army to liberate all of mankind and to protect the interests of the people." Xiao Mai excitedly replied: "I will definitely live up to the education of the brigade Party branch and the militia battalion. I will definitely do my best to serve the motherland and the people in the army to the end."
    With ideological guidance, one can sail against the wind and waves
    Mai Xiande put on a brand-new military uniform and stepped into the gate of the naval school.
    The school is located at the mouth of the Pearl River, the gateway to southern China. In his first lesson upon enlisting, he received an education in the Chinese people's tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. He followed the old squad leader to the position where the Chinese people fought against the British during the Opium War more than a century ago, to the Humen Fort where the British pirates were annihilated. Listening to the old squad leader's introduction, he seemed to see the imperialist gunboats frantically blasting open China's southern gate, the brutal slaughter of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people's magnificent anti-aggression battle scene. From this, he realized that imperialism's aggression against China often began with naval attacks. Facing the vast South China Sea, looking down at the passenger and cargo ships riding the wind and waves at the mouth of the Pearl River, his heart was filled with the pride of a sailor defending the motherland's seas. He vowed to the sea: Resolutely defend the territorial waters of the motherland and never allow the claws of the imperialist wolves to reach in again!
    When he began studying at the school, Mai Xiande encountered one "stumbling block" after another: difficult electrical and mechanical specialties, unfamiliar terminology, complex principles, endless data… Mai Xiande's cultural foundation was weak. He desperately memorized and recited, giving up many naps and holidays, and hiding alone on the top of the mountain to gnaw on professional books. It was really more difficult than an ant dragging a pig's tail!
    In May 1964, during one exam, Mai Xiande got two points. He was extremely sad. While he was dazed under a tree, the deputy instructor came to talk to him. He took the deputy instructor's hand and said with tears in his eyes: "I made a mistake! To defend the motherland, how can I eliminate the enemy if I don’t study technology well?"
    The deputy instructor asked him, "Have you ever thought about what fighting is mainly based on?"
    "Outstanding skills!"
    "Yes, you must have outstanding skills, but first of all, which is more important, ideological soundness or technical soundness?"
    Mai Xiande was stunned. The deputy instructor asked him to consult Chairman Mao's works and gave him the booklet "Communist Fighter An Yemin": "See what An Yemin relied on to be excellent."
    He eagerly read Chairman Mao's works: "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Serve the People," "On the Chongqing Negotiations"... He loved reading hero stories: Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, An Yemin, Lei Feng…
    Chairman Mao's words and the actions of the heroic figures gradually took root in his mind: To make revolution, only by using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide will you not take the wrong path; fighting mainly depends on courage and the fearless revolutionary spirit. Mai Xiande's ideology now had a rudder, and the motor in his brain started.
    At the very beginning of Mai Xiande’s combat life, the Party pointed out the direction and helped him take a crucial step.
    What an important first step! Mai Xiande's mind has been broadened ever since. What is rolling in his mind is not just circuits, pipelines, two points, three points, but more of the major events of the people and the major events of the world. American imperialism is desperately expanding the flames of its war of aggression against Vietnam. Mai Xiande could not contain his anger and said: "As soon as the war drums sound and the order is issued, I will take up my gun without hesitation, run to the battlefield, and fight the enemy with class hatred without mercy!" He thought: In order to eliminate the enemy, what preparations should revolutionary soldiers make ideologically? With this question in mind, he studied Chairman Mao's works and wrote many experiences: "The purpose of war is to eliminate the enemy is the main thing, and to preserve oneself is secondary, and to preserve oneself is to better eliminate the enemy. Sacrificing oneself for the interests of the people is the most glorious." From those dense lines, it can be seen that the heroic spirit of overwhelming all enemies began to form in Mai Xiande's mind.
    With this heroic spirit, no difficulties are insurmountable. What vividly illustrates Mai Xiande's ideological growth is a damage control training exercise. In a specially set training ground, it was assumed that the boat's engine room had been pierced by the enemy, and seawater was pouring violently from the shell hole. The squad leader shouted, "Plug the leak!" Mai Xiande picked up the leak plugging box with both hands and rushed forward. The water flow was too fierce to stop, so he raised the leak plugging pad again. The squad leader temporarily issued a situation: "The leak plugging pad is broken!" Mai Xiande searched around anxiously, but there were no available materials. What to do? He saw Mai Xiande open his arms, turned around, and used his back to block the shell hole. The raging torrent violently impacted him, but he did not move.
    A new soldier with no experience of ship life, at this critical moment, could resolutely use his body to plug the leak and protect the ship. How can this fearless revolutionary spirit be expressed by evaluating the professional skills of four or five points?! What truly reflects Mai Xiande's academic performance is not the "good in all subjects" in the appraisal, but the immeasurable "political factors."
    At the end of a year of study life, the leadership solicited Mai Xiande's opinions on his work. He replied directly: "The work assigned to me by the Party is my wish. Wherever the Party points, I will rush there. I must be like Comrade Zhang Side and contribute my life to the interests of the people and fight to the end for the revolutionary cause!"
    Mai Xiande was assigned to a gunboat with a heroic fighting tradition. Not long after getting on the boat, he encountered his first unforgettable voyage. The sea was blowing a force five or six wind, and the gunboat advanced rapidly against the wind and waves. Even veteran engine room soldiers who were accustomed to the wind and waves felt dizzy and vomited. For a new soldier, it was even a severe test. Mai Xiande insisted on following the old soldiers to keep watch. An old comrade saw him vomiting and asked him: "Can you hold on?" He said: "Yes! Great wind and waves are the time to test. Vomiting some sour water is nothing!" He did not leave the engine room during the dozen or so hours of the voyage. His comrades praised him as a "new soldier, old warrior." In summing up the ideological gains of this voyage, Mai Xiande wrote: "Not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of fatigue, not being afraid of danger and difficulty is the fine tradition of our army. Chairman Mao said: 'What is work? Work is struggle.' 'The more difficult the place, the more you have to go.' In the future, I must train myself into a strong revolutionary soldier in the storm."
    Since Comrade Lin Biao issued the instruction to give prominence to politics, Mai Xiande's consciousness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become even higher. Through continuous study of Chairman Mao's works, he absorbed endless strength and became stronger and stronger in revolutionary practice. In the process of his growth, he has become more and more fond of Chairman Mao's works. He wrote: "Chairman's works are worth a thousand gold, and the more you study them, the more you feel the truth of Marxism-Leninism. It teaches me to love and hate more clearly, and it teaches people to become more and more intelligent as they study. I joined the army to seek the truth, and I will give my heart and soul to serve the people. I am willing to be a revolutionary screw and defend the sea borders to annihilate the enemy." This is his personal experience and his lifelong ambition. Forever be a revolutionary volunteer
    The enemy shrapnel seriously damaged Mai Xiande's brain nerves, and he was sent to the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region. The Party decided to do everything possible to rescue the life of this heroic soldier. Some famous medical units across the country are all contributing to him. Everyone has one will and one heart: we must save Mai Xiande's life and we must cure Mai Xiande's injuries.
    When Mai Xiande first arrived at the hospital, he was in a coma, unable to speak, unable to move, his blood pressure was high, and his right limbs were paralyzed. But even at this critical moment of his life, he still showed his noble feelings of being devoted to the revolution and his heart being devoted to Chairman Mao everywhere.
    As soon as he could make sounds and pronounce words, the nurse heard him humming "The East is Red."
    As soon as he regained consciousness, he stared for a long time at the Chairman Mao quote board hanging on the head of the bed and asked the nurse to take it to him.
    When he opened "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," his lips trembled slightly with excitement when he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao.
    His right hand could not move, so he laboriously practiced holding a pen and writing with his left hand. The first five Chinese characters he wrote were "Long live Chairman Mao."
    On August 30, 1965, he was approved as a probationary member of the Communist Party of China. The nurse handed him the membership introduction letter transferred from the army. Comrades warmly congratulated him. His eyes flashed with excitement, and he read the introduction letter back and forth for more than ten minutes. At this time, Mai Xiande was not fully conscious, and the nurses wrote questions about some daily life problems on paper and asked him. His answers were often disordered, but his revolutionary fighting will was very strong. The nurse wrote: "Mai Xiande, are you a soldier?" He wrote in clear strokes: "Answer: Always be ready to eliminate invading enemies."
    When Mai Xiande was able to get out of bed and walk around, he launched a struggle against his injuries with an overwhelming spirit of tenacity. His right hand was paralyzed, and in the physical therapy room he gritted his teeth and used his left hand to lift his right hand and put it on the climbing bar, gradually raising it to exercise, until he was covered in sweat before he was willing to stop. His right leg was inflexible, so he asked the nurse to help him practice walking. Every step was very difficult, but he endured the pain and walked around the circle again and again. In the ward, he also worked hard to practice arithmetic to restore his ability to think. Sometimes the pain was so unbearable that he quietly stared at the Chairman Mao quote board in the ward: "...For illness, one must have a strong will to struggle..." His whole body immediately gained endless strength to overcome the pain and persist in exercise. In this way, he drew strength from Chairman Mao's works every moment. In the struggle against his injuries, he was always a winner.
    The actions of this heroic soldier nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought deeply moved all the comrades in the hospital. Everyone regarded him as an example to learn from. Some nurses could not help but write on paper to praise him: "Mai Xiande is a combat hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy." After Mai Xiande saw it, he picked up a pen and crossed out the four words "combat hero" and neatly filled in "volunteer soldier" next to it.
    What a good volunteer soldier! Mai Xiande’s various actions in the hospital demonstrated to people what a noble, broad, and clear spiritual realm a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought possesses! This cannot be simply understood as a manifestation of a heroic soldier's humble quality, nor can it be simply understood as a reflection of a soldier's deep understanding of military service. When the three characters "volunteer soldier" are linked to Mai Xiande's combat experience, its meaning is deeper and farther. Mai Xiande regarded himself as a volunteer soldier of the proletariat, a volunteer soldier of the revolution, and a volunteer soldier fighting for the cause of communism.

    毛泽东思想武装的钢铁战士
    ——记“海上英雄艇”轮机兵麦贤得
    毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，有最大的勇敢，最硬的骨头。
    在炮火纷飞的革命战争年代，在翻天覆地的社会主义建设时期，战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育了多少大智大勇的革命战士！他们用自己的英雄行为，写成了一首首壮丽的诗篇。如今，又一个坚强的英雄战士的形象树立在我们面前。“海上英雄艇”轮机兵麦贤得，头部负了重伤，脑脊液外流，竟然坚持战斗达三小时之久。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，才能有这种革命硬骨头！
        一往无前的战斗精神
    事情发生在一九六五年八月六日。
    凌晨，夜海茫茫，渔火点点，“海上英雄艇”和兄弟舰艇一起警惕地巡逻在海面，担任护渔任务。
    就在这时，美制蒋舰“剑门号”和“章江号”又贼头贼脑地闯进了东山岛附近的渔场。水兵们的心里激起了万丈怒火，纷纷表示：一定要狠狠地惩罚敌人，保卫人民生命财产，为受害的渔民兄弟报仇。
    轮机兵麦贤得挺立在主机操纵台，两眼注视着仪表。突然，机舱里的铃声响了，指挥员下达了作战命令。他一拉操纵杆，炮艇昂首破浪直奔敌舰。
    在蓝色指示灯光的照映下，写在机舱正面小黑板上的一句话，清晰地映入了麦贤得的眼帘：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在这战斗即将到来的时刻，毛主席的教导，使他感到格外亲切，全身更加激起无穷的力量。
    麦贤得，这个船民的儿子，对祖国的海洋怀有深厚的感情。他永远忘不了帝国主义和国民党反动派在祖国的海洋上犯下的滔天罪行。对人民的爱，对敌人的恨，为祖国杀敌立功，为阶级兄弟报仇雪恨的决心，一起涌上心头。他那乌亮的眼睛睁得更大了，双手紧紧把着操纵杆，脑子里只有一个念头：“坚决消灭敌人！”
      “海上英雄艇”和兄弟艇一起，发扬“刺刀见红”的精神，象一把利剑似的，奋勇地插向敌阵，把敌人的双舰编队，一下分割成两条孤舰。我英勇的舰艇编队，首先抓住了敌舰“章江号”，一串串愤怒的炮弹准确地飞向敌舰，炮火映红了半边海空。
  “章江号”被打得燃起了熊熊烈火，轮机兵们听着一阵阵响亮的炮声，兴奋地互相打着手势，表示要坚决打掉它！
    正在战斗激烈进行的时刻，“海上英雄艇”主机舱的后左机意外地停伡了，麦贤得立即跑过去帮助启动机器。就在这时，一块弹片打进麦贤得的右前额，插到左侧靠近太阳穴的额叶里。他顿时失去知觉，跌倒在机舱里。
    敌人的炮弹可以损伤一个战士的肉体，却摧毁不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士的杀敌决心和战斗意志。麦贤得一心想着战斗的胜利。副指导员替他包扎伤口的时候，他苏醒过来了。但他嘴里发不出声音，腿也站不起来。他着急了，用右手推着副指导员，左手吃力地指着机器。战友们立刻明白了麦贤得的意思：“机器，现在最要紧的是照管好机器！”副指导员把麦贤得搂在怀里，激动地说：“要听话，要服从命令！”麦贤得放下双手顺从地让包扎了。可是，副指导员刚刚转身离开机舱，他就用左手按着身旁的机器，支撑着站了起来。他以惊人的毅力，实现着他在学习毛主席著作心得笔记上表示的决心：“只要我的气还在喘着，我一定斗争下去！”
    麦贤得又站到战斗岗位上来了。他发现后左机早已启动，机器在正常地运转。于是他又向前机舱走去。从后机舱到前机舱，只有四十厘米宽、六十厘米高的椭圆形舱洞，即使是四肢完好、神志清醒的人，要钻过去也不太容易。可是，头负重伤的麦贤得却钻进了前机舱，并且一到那里就一刻不停地检查机器。
    在我舰艇的猛烈炮火轰击下，敌舰“章江号”已奄奄待毙，敌舰“剑门号”胆怯地躲在远处，向这里放着冷炮。麦贤得额上的鲜血，粘住眼角和睫毛，阻碍了视线。但是，他凭着平时练就的一手“夜老虎”硬功夫，顽强地坚守着战斗岗位。在剧烈摇摆的机舱里，他穿来绕去摸索着检查一根根管路，一个个阀门，一颗颗螺丝钉。他知道：敌舰还没有彻底歼灭，战斗决不能停止。
    时间一刻一刻过去了，是血流得太多了吧？是打进前额的弹片把他折磨得太久了吧？麦贤得的脚步虚浮了，动作迟钝了。但是，他那战斗的意志仍然十分坚强。看吧，就是在这种情况下，他居然能在几十条管路、千百个螺丝里检查出一个只有拇指大的螺丝被震松了；他居然能够用扳手把螺丝拧紧，保证了机器正常运转。就这样，麦贤得以有我无敌的精神，坚持战斗了三小时。当战友陈文乙把他按在一条毯子上，让他躺下休息时，他朝着陈文乙竖起两个手指，便昏迷过去了。不知道是在告诉战友前机舱的两部主机运转正常，还是在询问两艘敌舰是否已经全部被击沉？……
    敌舰“章江号”和“剑门号”先后葬身大海，战斗胜利结束了。一道金色的阳光从窗口射进来，投到麦贤得刚毅的脸上。陈文乙怀着无比崇敬的心情，凝视着自己亲密的战友，脑海里回响着毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”
      懂得了剥削才能懂得革命
    年轻的水兵麦贤得，出身在一个贫苦的船民家里。从记事的时候起，祖母和父母就经常给他讲一家几代的悲惨遭遇：日本鬼子烧掉他家的船，爷爷被活活饿死，父亲受尽了反动派的欺压，母亲带着哥哥到处逃荒，他刚出生，家乡就遭到敌人飞机的轰炸……。苦大仇深的家史，在麦贤得幼小的心灵中，深深地埋下阶级仇恨的种子。
    党的教育，新社会的熏陶，更使麦贤得懂得了阶级爱憎。麦贤得上小学的时候，老师给他们讲革命先烈的故事。麦贤得听了很受感动，他问老师：“先烈们搞革命是为穷苦人，这样的好人，国民党为什么要逮捕他们呢？国民党究竟是什么东西？”经过老师耐心的解释，他知道了：国民党是地主恶霸的代表，是长期统治中国人民的反动派。麦贤得读到初中一年级的时候，又从课本上知道了阶级是怎样产生的，人剥削人是怎么回事，同时也明白了自己家庭祖祖辈辈受穷受苦的根子。以后，他回家参加渔业生产，当了民兵。通过民兵营进行的忆苦教育，他看到同船上的老渔民麦细弟右腿被日本鬼子打的伤疤；又听到朱时玉控诉日本侵略者一枪打死了他的妈妈，还听到许许多多的民兵的血泪史……。他进一步懂得了，在旧社会有千千万万个家庭象他的家庭一样，被帝国主义和国民党反动派害得家破人亡，妻离子散；千千万万受苦受难的人，就象结在一条藤上的苦瓜。他把家庭的苦和整个阶级的苦融汇在一起，胸中燃起了仇恨敌人的怒火。不久，民兵营展开向雷锋学习的活动，麦贤得就以雷锋为榜样，开始学习毛主席著作。至今民兵营部还保留着麦贤得学习后写的一份心得笔记，上面写着：“今后我一定听党的话，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好民兵。”
    不管是当学生还是当民兵，麦贤得为了集体的利益，敢闯敢干，勇于承担重担。在学校里，有一次帮助公社送秧苗，当时风大雨大，沟宽水深，水蛇又多，麦贤得第一个自报奋勇去送，一直在水里干了近两个钟头。当民兵的时候，不管海上劳动多么紧张，他一回到家里，就扛着枪在海岸上巡逻。在一个暴风雨的晚上，他曾经趟着齐胸的潮水，一个人用船从被淹的公社粮仓里抢救出三千多斤粮食。在盐田受到潮水威胁的紧急时刻，他曾经和渔民一起，奋不顾身地投入堵堤坝的战斗！麦贤得当了两年民兵，两年被评为五好民兵，受到六次表扬奖励。
    一九六三年十一月，青年们热烈应征入伍，麦贤得急不可待地三次申请参军。他在一份申请书上写道：国民党残害我们，日本帝国主义过去残害我们，美帝国主义这样欺侮我们，我下定决心报名参军，我一定学习雷锋，做毛主席的好战士！
    麦贤得终于被批准入伍了。父母、乡亲们来送他，父亲嘱咐他：“我们代代受苦，到了部队上要好好听首长的话，好好干！”民兵营长麦克服也嘱咐他：“到了部队上，特别要学习《为人民服务》这篇文章。我们是为解放全人类去当兵的，为了保卫人民利益去当兵的。”小麦兴奋地回答道：“我一定不辜负大队党支部和民兵营对我的教育，我一定尽我的力气，为祖国、为人民，在部队上干到底。”
    思想上有了舵才能乘风破浪
    麦贤得穿上崭新的军装，跨进了海军学校的大门。
    学校住在祖国南方的门户珠江口。入伍第一课，他就受到了中国人民反帝斗争传统的教育。他跟随老班长，来到一百多年前鸦片战争时中国人民抗英作战的阵地，来到痛歼英国海盗的虎门炮台。听着老班长的介绍，他仿佛看到了帝国主义的炮舰，疯狂轰开中国南大门，野蛮屠杀中国人民的累累罪行，看到了中国人民气壮山河的反侵略战斗场面。从这里，他认识到，帝国主义对中国的侵略，常常是从海上进攻开始的。他面对滔滔南海，俯视珠江口客货巨轮乘风破浪，心中充满了水兵保卫祖国海洋的自豪感。他对着海洋立下誓言：坚决保卫祖国的海疆，决不让帝国主义豺狼的侵略魔爪再伸进来！
    在学校里开始学习的时候，麦贤得遇到了一个又一个的“拦路虎”：艰深的机电专业，生疏的术语，复杂的原理，无尽的数据……。麦贤得的文化底子薄，拼命的记呀，背呀，放弃了多少个午睡、假日，一个人躲在山顶上啃专业书，这真是比蚂蚁拖猪尾巴还难啊！
    一九六四年五月，有一次考试，麦贤得得了两分。他难过极了，正在树下发呆，副指导员来找他谈心。他拉着副指导员的手含着泪水说：“我犯错误了！保卫祖国，学不好技术，怎么去消灭敌人？”
    副指导员问他：“你想过吗？打仗主要是靠什么？”
    “过硬的本领呗！”
    “对，是要有过硬的本领，但是首先是思想过硬，还是技术过硬？”
    麦贤得楞住了。副指导员让他向毛主席著作请教，还把《共产主义战士安业民》那本小册子交给他：“看看安业民是凭什么过硬的。”
    他如饥似渴地读毛主席著作：《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》、《关于重庆谈判》……。他爱不释手地读英雄故事，董存瑞、黄继光、安业民、雷锋……。
    毛主席的话，英雄人物的行为，在他脑海里逐渐地扎下了根：要革命，只有以毛泽东思想为指针，才不会走错路线；打仗主要凭勇敢，凭大无畏的革命精神。麦贤得的思想上有了舵，头脑里的电机启动了。
    在麦贤得战斗生活刚刚开始的时候，党就是这样给他指明了方向，帮他迈出了关键的一步。
    多么重要的第一步！麦贤得的胸怀从此
  日益开阔起来。在他脑海里翻腾的已经不只是电路、管道、两分、三分，更多的是人民的大事，世界的大事。美帝国主义拼命扩大侵略越南的战火，麦贤得按不住满腔的愤怒说：“战鼓一响，命令一下，我就毫不犹豫拿起枪杆，跑上战场，怀着阶级仇恨来打敌人，决不留情！”他想：为了消灭敌人，革命战士在思想上要做什么准备呢？他带着这个问题，学习毛主席著作，写下了很多心得：“战争的目的，消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的，而保存自己是为了更好的消灭敌人。为人民利益牺牲自己是最光荣的。”从那些密密麻麻的字里行间，可以看出，压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，开始在麦贤得的脑子里形成了。
    有了这种英雄气概，什么困难都不在话下。生动地说明麦贤得思想成长的，是一次损坏管制训练。在特设的训练场上，假设艇的机舱被敌人打穿了，海水猛烈地从弹洞里涌了进来。班长喊道：“堵漏！”麦贤得两手捧起堵漏箱，冲向前去。水流太猛，堵不住，他又举起堵漏垫。班长临时出了一个情况：“堵漏垫坏了！”麦贤得着急地向周围搜索了一遍，没有可用的器材了，怎么办？只见麦贤得张开两臂，一转身，用脊背堵住了弹洞。汹涌的激流猛烈地冲击着他，他纹丝不动。
    一个没有一点舰艇生活经历的新战士，在这个紧要关头，能果断地用自己的身体去堵漏，去保护舰艇，这种大无畏的革命精神，怎能用评定专业技术的四分五分来表示呢？！真正反映麦贤得学习成绩的，不是鉴定中的“各项课目良好”，而是无法估量的“政治因素”。
    一年的学习生活结束了，领导上征求麦贤得对工作的意见，他直截了当地回答：“党分配我的工作就是我的志愿。党指向那里，我就奔向那里，一定要象张思德同志那样，为人民利益贡献自己的一生，为革命事业奋斗到底！”
    麦贤得被分配到一个有英勇战斗传统的炮艇上。上艇不久，就遇上了第一次难忘的远航。海面上刮着五六级大风，炮艇顶风劈浪，快速前进，连饱经风浪的老轮机兵都头昏呕吐了，对一个新战士来说，就更是一次严重的考验。麦贤得硬要跟着老战士去值更。一个老同志见他呕吐，问他：“你能顶得住吗？”他说：“能！大风大浪正是考验的时候，吐点酸水算不了什么！”十几个小时的远航，他没有离开过机舱，战友们夸他是“新兵老战士”。麦贤得在总结这次远航的思想收获时写道：“不怕苦，不怕累，不怕艰险困难，是我军的优良传统。毛主席说：‘什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。’‘越是困难的地方越是要去’。我今后一定要在暴风雨中锻炼成一个坚强的革命战士。”
    林彪同志提出突出政治的指示以后，麦贤得活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性更高了。他通过不断地学习毛主席著作，吸取了无穷无尽的力量，在革命实践中锻炼得愈来愈坚强了。他在自己成长的过程中，也愈来愈热爱毛主席著作了。他写道：“主席著作值千金，越学越觉主义真。教我爱憎倍分明，教人越学越精灵。为求真理来当兵，掏尽红心来为民。甘当革命螺丝钉，坚守海疆歼敌人。”这是他的切身体会，也是他的毕生志愿。永远做革命的义务兵
    敌人的炮弹片严重地伤害了麦贤得的脑神经，他被送到广州部队总医院。党决定用一切办法抢救这位英雄战士的生命。全国一些著名的医疗单位都在为他出力。大家一个意志一条心：一定要把麦贤得救活，一定要把麦贤得的伤治好。
    麦贤得初到医院，神志昏迷，不会说话，不能活动，血压升高，右侧肢体呈现瘫痪。但是就在这生命垂危的时刻，他仍然处处表现了一心为革命，心向毛主席的崇高感情。
    他刚刚能发音吐字，护士就听到他咿咿唔唔地唱起了“东方红”。
    他神志稍一清醒，就久久地望着床头挂的毛主席语录板，要护士拿给他看。
    他翻开《毛泽东选集》，一看到毛主席的象，就激动得嘴唇微微颤抖。
    他右手不能动了，就用左手艰难地学习握笔写字。最先写的五个大字是“毛主席万岁”。
    一九六五年八月三十日，他被批准为中国共产党预备党员，护士把部队转来的党员介绍信送到他手里，同志们热烈地向他祝贺。他眼里闪动着激动的光芒，把介绍信翻来复去看了十几分钟。这时，麦贤得神志还不十分清醒，护士们在纸上写字问他一些日常生活问题，他写的回答常常是错乱的，但是他那革命的战斗意志却十分强烈。护士写道：“麦贤得，你是个战士吗？”他一笔一划地写道：“答：随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。”
    麦贤得在稍稍能起床走动的时候，就以压倒一切的顽强精神，与创伤展开了搏斗。右手瘫痪了，他在体疗室里咬紧牙关，用左手抬起右手，搭到攀杆上，逐级往上抬高，进行锻炼，直到汗流浃背还不肯罢休。右腿不灵便，他要求护士搀着练习走路。每走一步都非常艰难，但他忍着疼痛走了一圈又一圈。在病房里他还苦苦练习算术，恢复思索能力。有时伤痛实在难忍了，他便静静地注视着病房里的毛主席语录板：“……对于病，要有坚强的斗争意志，……”他全身立刻增添了战胜伤痛、坚持锻炼的无穷力量。就这样，他每时每刻从毛主席著作中吸取力量。在与伤势作斗争中，他总是一个胜利者。
    毛泽东思想哺育起来的这位英雄战士的行为，深深感动了医院的所有同志。大家都把他当作自己学习的榜样。有的护士情不自禁地在纸上写字赞扬他：“麦贤得是中国人民解放军海军战斗英雄”，麦贤得看了，拿起笔来涂掉“战斗英雄”四个字，在旁边工工整整填上“义务兵”。
    多么好的一个义务兵呵！麦贤得在医院中的种种行动，在人们面前展示出一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，具有多么崇高，多么开阔，多么明朗的精神境界！这不能仅仅理解为一个英雄战士谦虚品质的流露，也不能仅仅理解为一个战士对服役有深刻认识的反映。“义务兵”这三个字和麦贤得的战斗历程连系起来看，它的涵意更深更远。麦贤得把自己看成是无产阶级的义务兵，革命的义务兵，为共产主义事业奋斗的义务兵。
