    荥阳 County is a hilly area with shallow mountains, historically a region suffering from drought nine years out of ten. In recent years, there has been more rainfall, with harvests every year, so not much attention was paid to water conservancy construction.
    The year before last, many comrades from our county party committee visited the soil and water conservation projects of the Dazhai Brigade and the water conservancy construction of Lin County. Everyone was sincerely convinced. After returning, the county party committee held a meeting to compare our work with theirs. In terms of conditions, Xingyang is no worse than Lin County and even better than Dazhai. In terms of foundation, we are also better than them. Why is Xingyang's work lagging behind? The main reason is that the county party committee's leadership is lacking in spirit, lacking the ambition and lofty ideals to completely change the face of Xingyang, and lacking a high degree of responsibility to the people. Instead, we are satisfied with the current achievements and cannot break the old ways and old frameworks of leadership methods. Although we have been busy and hardworking in the past few years, we have made the mistake of engaging in pure administration.
    Thought guides action. Everyone believed that what the people of Dazhai and Lin County could do, we could certainly do as well. After the wheat harvest last year, the leading comrades of the county party committee reversed the past work style of running around and listening and looking. They divided the county into three areas according to water conservancy irrigation areas, with county party committee comrades assigned to each area, going down to the teams to stay, personally directing, and taking responsibility to the end. The change in the thinking and work style of the leading comrades drove the entire party cadres and the broad masses. In the past five months, we have done things that have not been done in many years. Many water conservancy projects that were built played a huge role in last year's fight against drought, ensuring a bumper harvest of autumn crops despite the severe drought. The battles for water conservancy construction, water conservancy supporting facilities, and soil and water conservation last winter and this spring have also achieved great results.
    What does the practice of struggle in these months show? It shows that the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee's leadership determines the quality of the work in a county. The words and deeds of the county party committee's leadership have a demonstrative effect on the entire county.

    领导变，就能打破陈规
    荥阳县是个浅山丘陵，历来是十年九旱的地区。近几年雨水较多，年年丰收，对水利建设便没有多注意了。
    前年，我们县委不少同志参观了大寨大队的水土保持工程和林县的水利建设，大家口服心服。回来后，县委就开会对照自己的工作。论条件荥阳不比林县差，更比大寨强，论基础也比人家好，为什么荥阳的工作落后了呢？主要是县委领导精神不振，缺乏彻底改变荥阳面貌的雄心壮志和远大理想，缺乏高度地为人民负责的精神，而是满足于眼前的既得成绩，打不破老一套、旧框框的领导方法。几年来的工作，虽然也是忙忙碌碌、辛辛苦苦，却犯了事务主义的错误。
    思想支配行动。大家认为，大寨、林县人民能够办到的事，我们也一定能够办到。去年麦收之后，县委领导同志扭转了过去那种跑跑转转，听听看看的工作作风，按水利灌区把全县划为三片，县委同志分工包片，蹲点到队，亲自指挥，负责到底。领导同志思想和工作作风的转变，带动了全党干部和广大群众，五个月来，办了过去许多年未曾办到的事。许多兴修的水利工程，在去年的抗旱斗争中发挥了巨大作用，保证了秋作物在大旱之下的丰收。去冬今春的水利建设、水利配套和水土保持的战斗，也取得了很大成绩。
    这几个月的斗争实践，说明什么呢？说明县委领导的思想革命化，决定着一个县的工作好坏；县委领导的一言一语，一举一动，都对全县起着示范性的作用。
    河南荥阳县委书记  张兴钿
