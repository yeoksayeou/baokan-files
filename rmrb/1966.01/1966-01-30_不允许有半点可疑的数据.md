    No Room for Doubtful Data
    Chen Shuying (female, 22 years old), Well Foreman, First Oil Extraction Command, Daqing Oilfield
    Data is the Eye to Understanding the Oil Formation
    One day in early May 1963, I was on duty and noticed the oil measurement time was five seconds longer than the previous shift. To grasp the true situation of the oil well, there can be no room for even the slightest bit of doubtful data; even five seconds difference must be thoroughly investigated. Whether or not one values primary data is the dividing line between having a scientific attitude and not. Therefore, I conducted a second oil measurement, which was still longer than the previous shift. What caused this? I analyzed it carefully: considering the oil well's condition, it was normal; checking myself, every operation of opening and closing the gate valve was without any error. I thought, could there be a problem with the glass tube? Upon disassembling the glass tube, I found the swollen asbestos rope end was causing an obstruction, prolonging the oil measurement time. I eliminated the fault in time and obtained data similar to the previous shift. I deeply realized that data is the sharp eye for understanding the oil formation; one wrong data point is like a grain of sand in a person's eye, obscuring the true picture. An error in the data adds to the difficulty of correctly understanding the oil formation. Therefore, we must be strict and serious when dealing with data, and not be careless in the slightest.
    To better grasp the changes in groundwater, we made our own sampling bucket, hung between the wax scraper and the plumb bob, and took samples every time after cleaning the wax.
    Over the past five years, we have obtained more than 575,000 pieces of original data, which, after 47 checks, are consistent and accurate, providing true and reliable data for correctly understanding the oil formation.
    Grasping the Essence Through Phenomena
    In 1964, the leadership put forward the call for comprehensive stratified management. At this time, some comrades in the well team developed a sense of fear. I myself didn't have any confidence either. Should we do it or not? At that time, stratified analysis was a key focus, and it had to be done. If we had to do it, but didn't know how, what should we do? We studied "On Practice," which further made us realize that as long as we dare to practice, break the rules, and dare to make revolution, we can overcome difficulties and learn stratified analysis. Everyone gained confidence and also studied "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountain," which strengthened our determination. From then on, stratified analysis began in the entire well team.
    At the beginning, we started by collecting the original data of this well to become familiar with the underground conditions. We also went to four units and eight well teams to learn from their experiences. During the day, we collected data, and at night, we organized and analyzed it, and drew the changes of each layer of oil and water wells in each period into stratified pressure and production change curves. With these curves and the oil and water well communication diagram, we began to learn stratified analysis. But where to start? At this time, I thought of what Chairman Mao said: "We must look at the essence of things, and regard the phenomena only as a guide for entry. Once we enter the door, we must grasp the essence, which is the reliable scientific method of analysis." How to grasp the essence? I thought, the changes in oil wells are caused by water wells, so to manage oil wells well, we must first understand water wells. Therefore, we learned about the dynamics of water wells every ten days and combined it with the changes in oil wells for comprehensive analysis.
    Oil wells are constantly producing, and underground conditions are constantly changing. In the process of water flooding, oilfields are injecting water, and it is impossible for oil wells not to see water; seeing water is an inevitable phenomenon. But whether it is seen early or late is a matter of concern. In April 1964, the oil well showed signs of early water breakthrough. How to deal with water? To find a solution, we must first study the reasons for early water breakthrough. After analysis and discussion, we finally found that the main reason for the early water breakthrough in the oil well was a water injection experiment being carried out in the eastern part of the central area of the oilfield. After finding the reason, we put forward specific measures, and through hard work, the water breakthrough in the oil well was delayed. From then on, we also improved our thinking, realizing that managing oil wells is doing revolution, and doing revolution requires daring to struggle and daring to win, seriously treating every even the smallest change. We must be able to discover it in time, find out exactly what is happening, and solve it correctly, so that we can take the initiative.
    Over the past five years, we have conducted 1,459 comprehensive analyses of oil and water wells, and written 24 summary reports. All the comrades in the well team have mastered the methods of stratified calculation and stratified analysis. Using these analysis methods, we can conduct comprehensive and systematic analyses of the changes in each period of oil and water wells, and clearly understand the relationship between the pressure, production, and water content of each layer. In this way, through analysis, we further deepened our understanding of the oil formation and uncovered the secrets of the oil formation.

    不允许有半点可疑的数据
    大庆油田第一采油指挥部井长　陈淑英（女，二十二岁）
    资料是认识油层的眼睛
    一九六三年五月初的一天，我值班时发现量油时间比上一班多了五秒钟。要掌握油井真实情况，就不允许有半点可疑的数据，差五秒钟也要弄个水落石出。重视不重视第一性资料，是有没有科学态度的分界线。因此，我又进行了第二次量油，仍然比上一班多。是什么原因造成的呢？我仔细地分析：从油井情况来考虑是正常的；从我本身来检查，开闸门、关闸门，每一个操作都没有一点差错。我想，可能是玻璃管有问题吧？卸开玻璃管一看，发现被泡胀的石绵绳头有阻碍的现象，延长了量油时间。我及时排除了故障，取得了和上班相似的数据。我深刻地认识到，资料是认识油层的锐利眼睛，错了一个数据，就等于人的眼睛里掉进了一粒砂子，就会看不清事物的真象。资料上出一个差错，就给我们正确认识油层增加一分困难。因此，对待资料数据，一定要严格认真，丝毫不能马虎。
    为了更好地掌握地下水的变化情况，我们自己搞了一个取样桶，挂在刮蜡片和铅锤的中间，每次清完蜡都要把样取出来。
    五年来，我们共取得了原始资料五十七万五千多个，经过四十七次检查，上下对口，齐全准确，为正确认识油层提供了真实可靠的资料。
    透过现象抓住实质
    一九六四年，领导提出了全面分层管理的号召。这时，井组有的同志思想上产生了怕的念头。我心里也确实没有底。搞还是不搞？当时分层分析是个主攻方向，非搞不可。要搞，又不会，怎么办？我们学习了《实践论》，进一步认识到，只要敢于实践，打破框框，勇于革命，就能战胜困难，就能学会分层分析。大伙有了信心，又学习了《愚公移山》，增强了决心。从此以后，分层分析便在全井组搞开了。
    一开始，我们先从收集这口井的原始资料入手，熟悉地下情况。并先后到四个单位、八个井组学习经验。白天收集资料，晚上整理分析，并把油水井各个层的每一个时期的变化绘制成了分层压力、产量变化曲线图。拿着这些曲线图和油水井连通图，开始学习分层分析。但是，从那里学起呢？这时，我想到毛主席讲的：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”怎样抓住实质呢？我想，油井的变化是由水井引起的，因此，要管好油井，首先要从了解水井入手。于是，我们就每隔十天了解一下水井动态，结合油井变化进行综合分析。
    油井在不断生产，地下情况也在不断地变化。在以水驱油的过程当中，油田在注水，油井不可能不见水，要见水是个必然的现象。可是早见水还是迟见水，却是值得重视的问题。一九六四年四月，油井出现了提前见水的预兆。怎样来对付水呢？要找出对策，首先就得研究提前见水的原因。经过分析讨论，终于找出了引起油井提前见水的主要原因是，油田中区东部正在进行一项注水试验。原因找到之后，我们提出了具体措施，经过努力，使油井见水推迟了。从此，我们在思想上也提高了一步，认识到管油井就是干革命，干革命就要敢于斗争、敢于胜利，严肃地对待每一个那怕是微小变化。一定要做到及时发现，确实弄清，正确解决，才能立足于主动。
    五年来，我们共进行了油水井综合分析一千四百五十九次，写出总结报告二十四篇，全井组的同志都掌握了分层计算、分层分析方法。运用这些分析方法，我们能够把油水井每一个时期的变化，进行综合性系统的分析，把每一个分层的压力、产量、含水的关系搞得清清楚楚。就这样，我们通过分析，进一步加深了对油层的认识，揭开了油层的秘密。
