    Hanoi, Xinhua News Agency Dispatch – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front recently decided to award the First Class Wall of Iron Medal to workers in some cities and rubber plantations, and to peasants in various regions of South Vietnam; and to award the First Class Liberation Medal to university and middle school students in some cities of South Vietnam and to some units, including a technical factory, a radio station, and "Unit 2000," in recognition of their significant contributions to the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    The report stated that the struggle of workers in various cities of the South against enemy oppression and exploitation has been sustained and widely developed. Workers have adopted a variety of forms of struggle, such as strikes and factory occupations, and have closely coordinated their struggles with those of people from all walks of life to wage a heroic struggle against the enemy. The general strike held on September 21, 1964, paralyzed all enemy activities.

    Workers on various rubber plantations have also engaged in continuous struggles against the enemy, and have provided substantial manpower and material resources for the cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation.

    The report stated that the peasants of South Vietnam are united and have waged a staunch and unyielding struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. They have risen up to destroy "strategic hamlets," crushed the enemy's ruling organs in the countryside, and fundamentally shaken the brutal fascist rule of the U.S.-puppet clique in South Vietnam. Now, they are actively launching competitions, striking at the American invading bandits with a spirit of determination to win final victory, and contributing to the liberation of the South, the defense of the North, and the ultimate reunification of the motherland.

    The report said that university and middle school students in some cities of the South are waging a resolute struggle against the enemy. They have fought heroically against the enemy with their bare hands. In these struggles, many outstanding students who dared to fight, dared to win, and dared to sacrifice have emerged, such as Le Quang Vinh and Le Hong Ty.

    The report said that the technical factory that received the Liberation Medal was established and developed in the liberated areas under extremely difficult conditions. The workers and cadres of this factory continuously improve their technology and labor productivity, rely on their own efforts, and use machines they produce themselves to equip many production departments in various places, making contributions to the revolutionary cause.

    The radio station that received the Liberation Medal has long improved its professional level and ensured the quality of its work, starting from the needs of the revolution. The staff of the radio station worked hard, and although they were few in number, they still completed their work tasks excellently and also trained a group of cadres for other departments.

    The cadres and workers of "Unit 2000," which received the Liberation Medal, worked actively and overcame all difficulties to complete their production tasks with high quality, and trained a large number of cadres for various places.

    Hanoi, Xinhua News Agency Dispatch – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam recently held a conference to confer the honorary title of "American-Annihilating Warrior" on a group of soldiers who had contributed to annihilating the American invaders.

    Quang Nam Province is the hometown of martyr Nguyen Van Troi. The soldiers and civilians of this province harbor a deep hatred for the American invading troops who kill, set fires, and commit all kinds of evil deeds. They have realized the slogan of "find Americans to fight, annihilate Americans whenever you see them." Everyone has tried every means to bravely kill the enemy and made brilliant achievements in battle. Many of their outstanding soldiers attended this conference:

    A T from Ky Sinh commune, Tam Ky district, fought nine battles, killing and wounding twenty American devils. A Nghia, the leader of the vanguard group in the Thanh Son battle, persisted in fighting despite being wounded in this battle, plunged straight into the American troops, and annihilated nearly forty American devils by himself.

    There were also guerrilla fighters such as A Cai, who cleverly used pointed stake boards to eliminate seven American devils, A Phi, who bravely threw grenades into enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, annihilated a whole platoon of American troops, and A D, a guerrilla captain who continuously killed enemies on Highway 46 and once led guerrillas deep into the enemy's barbed wire, attacking the enemy.

    南越人民群众是真正的铜墙铁壁
    民族解放阵线中央授予一些地区的群众和单位“铜墙”等勋章
    广南省授予歼灭美国侵略者有功战士“歼美勇士”的光荣称号
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团最近决定授予越南南方一些城市和橡胶园的工人和各地区的农民以一级铜墙勋章；授予越南南方一些城市的大、中学生和一些单位，包括技术厂、广播电台、“二零零零”单位等以一级解放勋章，以表扬他们在抗美救国斗争中作出的重大贡献。
    报道说，南方各个城市的工人反对敌人压迫和剥削的斗争一直持续和广泛地发展着。工人们采取了罢工和占领工厂等丰富的斗争形式，并且同各阶层同胞的斗争密切配合，同敌人进行了英勇的斗争。一九六四年九月二十一日举行的总罢工，使敌人的一切活动都陷于瘫痪。
    各个橡胶园的工人也同敌人进行了连续不断的斗争，并且为抗美救国事业提供了大量的人力和物力。
    报道说，越南南方农民团结一致，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了坚强不屈的斗争。他们奋起捣毁“战略村”，粉碎了敌人在农村的统治机构，从根本上动摇了美伪集团在越南南方的残暴法西斯统治。现在，他们正在积极开展竞赛，以决战决胜精神打击美国侵略强盗，为解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国作出贡献。
    报道说，南方一些城市的大、中学生同敌人进行着坚决的斗争。他们赤手空拳，同敌人进行了英勇的搏斗。在这些斗争中，涌现出许多敢于斗争，敢于胜利，敢于牺牲的优秀的学生，如黎光咏和黎鸿司等。
    报道说，获得解放勋章的技术厂是在解放区十分艰苦的条件下建立和发展起来的。这个厂的工人和干部不断提高技术和劳动生产率，自力更生，用自己生产的机器装备了各地的许多生产部门，为革命事业作出了贡献。
    获得解放勋章的广播电台长期以来从革命的需要出发，不断提高业务水平，保证了工作的质量。电台的工作人员刻苦努力，虽然人数很少，但仍出色地完成了工作任务，还为其他部门培养了一批干部。
    获得解放勋章的“二零零零”单位的干部和工人积极努力，克服一切困难，以很高的质量完成了自己的生产任务，并且为各地培养了大批的干部。
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省最近召开大会，向一批歼灭美国侵略者有功的战士授予“歼美勇士”的光荣称号。
    广南省是阮文追烈士的故乡，这个省的军民对那些杀人放火、无恶不作的美国侵略军怀着刻骨的仇恨，他们实现了“找美国佬打、见美国佬就歼”的口号，人人千方百计英勇杀敌，立下了光辉的战功。他们当中的许多优秀战士出席了这次大会：
    三岐县其生乡的阿T，他作战九次，打死打伤二十名美国鬼子。参加青山之战的尖兵组组长阿义，在这次战斗中，不顾自己已经负伤，坚持战斗，直插进美军队伍，一个人就歼灭了近四十名美国鬼子。
    另外还有巧妙地用尖桩板消灭七名美国鬼子的游击队员阿改、勇敢地向敌人M—113两栖装甲车里投进手榴弹，全歼美军一个班的游击队员阿非和连续在第四十六号公路上杀敌，并且曾经带领游击队深入到敌军的铁丝网旁，袭击敌人的游击队长阿D等。
