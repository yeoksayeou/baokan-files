    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 16th, for the past month, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has widely carried out activities to support the government and cherish the people, focusing on learning from local leadership at all levels and the masses of people. The broad masses of commanders and soldiers have gone to industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes to learn and seek advice, determined to acquire the good experiences, good work styles, and good methods of the local areas, and promote the ideological revolutionization and work style revolutionization of the troops.

      "The local areas are learning from the army, and we should even more humbly and conscientiously learn from the local areas." This is the resounding slogan put forward by the commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army during this year's "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month." A certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region sent a group of cadres to Beijing to visit the National Dazhai-type Agricultural Model Exhibition. After returning, they immediately conveyed the information widely within the unit, determined to take the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the advanced agricultural units as an example to strengthen grassroots construction. A certain unit stationed on Hainan Island visited the Hainan State Farm Achievement Exhibition Hall and were all moved by the spirit of the farm workers who took pride in hardship, regarded the island as their home, and started their businesses arduously. They expressed their willingness to learn from the farm workers and make greater contributions in the struggle to defend and build Hainan. Cadres of a certain unit of the Guizhou garrison who participated in the socialist education movement also launched activities to summarize the advantages of local cadres and find gaps in their thinking and work, determined to learn the good qualities and good work styles of local cadres.

    In the mass learning activities from the local areas, many troops went to the local areas to learn, with questions in mind, focusing on their own needs. A certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region had a large number of new recruits. After returning from field training, they took the soldiers to the countryside and lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, asking them to introduce the village history and family history to improve the class consciousness of the young soldiers. The Lingdou Militia Company in the Xiamen area is an advanced unit in the Fujian front line for the militia to study Chairman Mao's works and fight against the enemy. Bi Hualin, the company commander of a certain unit, recently took the squad leaders and platoon leaders to visit and study for the fourth time. After the militia cadres introduced their deeds and experiences in highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and being constantly prepared in the struggle against the enemy, everyone said that they had received an education in the thought of people's war and expressed that they would learn from the old militia's spirit of standing guard and watching the sea day and night for sixteen years, better unite the broad masses of people and the militia, and strengthen joint military-civilian defense. The female cooks of a certain communications general station of the Shenyang Military Region recently also visited Li Suwen, the deputy instructor of the Heping Non-staple Food Store in Shenyang, and asked her to introduce how to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and serve the people completely and thoroughly. After they went back, they checked themselves against each other, found the gaps, and decided to better study Chairman Mao's works in the new year, work hard on the word "use," and be a red female cook.

    During the "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month," the troops also constantly sent cadres and soldiers to the masses to publicize Mao Zedong Thought, the Party's policies and guidelines, and the excellent situation at home and abroad. The activists in studying Chairman Mao's works and the "Five-Good" soldiers of the Fifth Company of a certain unit guarding the East China Sea front recently held an experience exchange meeting with the local militia to study Chairman Mao's works. Yuan Shaoting, a soldier who has been red every year since enlisting for four years, introduced his experience in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the militia. The troops stationed on Hainan Island, according to the characteristics of the Hainan area, used various lively forms to publicize Chairman Mao's thought of people's war to the people.

    During this period, activities to support industrial and agricultural construction and help the masses to do good things were also widely launched throughout the army. A certain unit of the Chengdu Military Region recently sent more than 4,000 people to help the local people's commune level land, improve soil, and carry out large-scale farmland capital construction. A certain unit of the naval aviation that shot down intruding U.S. planes last year, in the midst of intense combat readiness, spared manpower and material resources to help the commune production team build irrigation channels. Commanders and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Lhasa, Tibet, recently braved the cold wind and rushed to the South District early in the morning to carry water for the residents, sweep the streets, and remove garbage. Wang Minyou, the deputy political instructor of a certain unit, learned that some farmers near his station needed to repair their farm tools, and immediately took carpenters, ironworkers, fitters, etc. to repair them, which was praised by the Tibetan people.

    Since the new year, in order to strengthen the troops' education in supporting the government and cherishing the people, all units have generally studied Chairman Mao's expositions on the people's army, the people's war, and the unity of the army and the government and the unity of the army and the people, widely summarized the troops' experience in doing mass work, and established discipline inspection teams to solicit opinions from local party and government organs and the masses, inspect the troops' implementation of policies and laws and compliance with discipline, and some units also commended a group of advanced units and advanced figures in supporting the government and cherishing the people.

    解放军广泛开展拥政爱民活动
    “地方正在学军队，我们更应该虚心地扎扎实实地学地方。”
    据新华社十六日讯　近一个月来，中国人民解放军以向地方各级领导机关、人民群众学习为中心，广泛开展了拥政爱民活动。广大指战员到工矿企业、人民公社取经求教，决心把地方上的好经验、好作风、好方法学到手，促进部队的思想革命化、作风革命化。
      “地方正在学军队，我们更应该虚心地扎扎实实地学地方。”这是今年拥政爱民月里，人民解放军指战员们提出的响亮的口号。广州部队某部派出一批干部到北京参观了全国大寨式农业典型展览，回去以后立即在部队内广泛传达，决心以农业先进单位自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神为榜样，加强基层建设。驻海南岛部队某部参观了海南国营农场成就展览馆，都为农场工人以苦为荣、以岛为家、艰苦创业的精神所感动，纷纷表示向农场工人学习，在保卫海南、建设海南的斗争中作出更大的贡献。贵州驻军某部参加社会主义教育运动的干部还开展了总结地方干部的优点、找思想和工作差距的活动，决心把地方干部的好品德、好作风学到手。
    在群众性的向地方学习的活动中，许多部队针对着自己的需要，带着问题到地方取经。南京部队某部新战士较多，他们野营归来以后，又带着战士到了农村，住到贫农下中农家里，请贫农下中农介绍村史、家史，提高青年战士的阶级觉悟。厦门地区岭兜民兵连是福建前线民兵学习毛主席著作和对敌斗争的先进单位，某部连长毕华林最近带着班长、排长第四次去参观学习，在民兵干部们介绍了他们突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作、在对敌斗争中常备不懈的事迹和经验以后，每个人都说受到了一次人民战争思想教育，表示要学习老民兵十六年如一日在海边站岗放哨的精神，更好地团结广大群众和民兵，加强军民联防。沈阳部队某部通信总站的女炊事员们，最近还访问了沈阳市和平副食品商店副指导员李素文，请她介绍怎样活学活用毛主席著作，做到完全、彻底地为人民服务。她们回去后对照检查自己，找出差距，决心在新的一年里更好地学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，做一个红色女炊事兵。
    在拥政爱民月里，各部队还不断派出干部、战士到人民群众中宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针、政策和国内外的大好形势。守卫在东海前线的某部五连的学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士们，最近同驻地民兵一起举行了学习毛主席著作经验交流会，入伍四年以来年年红的战士袁少庭，给民兵们介绍了活学活用毛主席著作的经验。驻海南岛部队根据海南地区特点，运用各种生动活泼的形式，向人民群众宣传毛主席的人民战争的思想。
    这期间，支援工农业建设，帮助群众办好事的活动也在全军广泛展开。成都部队某部最近派出四千多人帮助驻地人民公社平整土地、改良土壤，大搞农田基本建设。去年连续击落入侵美机的海军航空兵某部，在紧张战备中，抽出人力物力，帮助公社生产队兴修灌溉渠道。驻西藏拉萨某部指战员最近冒着寒风，一清早就赶到南城区，为居民背水，打扫街道，清除垃圾。某部副政治指导员王民有得知驻地附近农民有一部分农具要修理，立即带着木工、铁工、钳工等前去修理，受到藏族人民的赞扬。
    新年以来，各单位为了加强部队的拥政爱民教育，普遍学习了毛主席有关人民军队、人民战争和军政一致、军民一致的论述，广泛总结了部队做群众工作的经验，并成立了纪律检查组，到驻地党、政府机关和人民群众中征求意见，检查部队执行政策法令和遵守纪律的情况，有些单位还表扬了一批拥政爱民中的先进单位、先进人物。
