    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 9th Dispatch: U.S. aggressor troops are frantically launching large-scale offensives against the liberated areas of South Vietnam in succession.

    According to Western news agencies, the U.S. aggressor troops' 1st Infantry Division and 173rd Airborne Brigade, along with Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, dispatched several regiments on the 8th to launch a major invasion of the liberated area known as the "Iron Triangle," more than 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon. The Associated Press quoted a U.S. military commander as saying that the number of U.S. troops participating in this offensive was approximately 8,000, making it "the largest operation ever conducted by U.S. forces."

    It was revealed that the U.S. aggressors also dispatched 200 helicopters and a large number of naval and air combat aircraft, a large number of armored vehicles, and various types of artillery to cooperate in the operation, and also dispatched B-52 type aircraft for bombing in advance. The Associated Press said that the scale of dispatching 200 helicopters in one operation like this was also "unprecedented."

    Prior to this, the United States dispatched several battalions of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, along with Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, and nine battalions of South Vietnamese puppet paratroopers, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, to launch a large-scale "sweep" lasting eight days in the Duc Hoa area, about 50 kilometers west of Saigon, and this "sweep" had just "ended" on the 8th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 9th Dispatch: The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces on the 8th again bombed the "My Canh" floating restaurant on the Saigon River, a place where U.S. aggressor troops often go to revel. This restaurant is about 500 meters away from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

    According to Western news agencies, the explosion occurred at around 7:30 p.m., when the restaurant was full of U.S. aggressor troops. They were terrified and made fools of themselves.

    A large number of U.S. puppet police and soldiers hurriedly sealed off the scene and searched everywhere in fear, afraid that a second explosion would occur.

    It was also reported that at around 8:00 a.m. on the same day, the People's Armed Forces exploded a coffee shop for puppet troops in Thuan Hoa District, Soc Trang Province, killing and wounding 21 people, including the puppet village chief, puppet soldiers, puppet civil guard, and puppet police.

    “和平”喧嚷未已　战争步伐加紧
    美国侵略军向南越解放区发动疯狂进攻
    南越人民武装再炸西贡“美景”餐厅吓得美军丧魂失魄
    新华社九日讯　西贡消息：美国侵略军疯狂地向越南南方解放区接连发动大规模进攻。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国侵略军第一步兵师和一七三空降旅，伙同澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军，八日出动好几个团的兵力，大举进犯西贡西北三十多公里被称为“铁三角”地带的解放区。美联社援引一位美军指挥官的话说，参加这次进攻的美军人数大约有八千人，这是“迄今为止美军进行的规模最大的活动”。
    据透露，美国侵略者还出动了二百架直升飞机和大批海空军作战飞机、大批装甲车和各种类型的大炮配合作战，并且事前还出动B—52型飞机进行轰炸。美联社说，象这样一次出动二百架直升飞机的规模也是“前所未有的”。
    在这以前，美国出动了一七三空降旅的几个营，伙同澳大利亚、新西兰帮凶军，以及九个营的南越伪军伞兵，在飞机大炮的掩护下，向西贡以西约五十公里的德和地区发动了为时八天的大规模“扫荡”，而这次“扫荡”在八日刚告“结束”。
    据新华社九日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民武装八日再次爆炸西贡河上美国侵略军常去寻欢作乐的“美景”水上餐厅。这个餐厅离开美国驻西贡“大使馆”大约五百米。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次爆炸发生在晚上七时半左右，当时餐厅里正坐满了美国侵略军。他们被吓得丧魂失魄，洋相百出。
    大批美伪军警慌忙封锁了出事地点，并且胆战心惊的四处搜索，害怕还会发生第二次爆炸。
    另据报道，在这同一天的早上八点钟左右，人民武装在朔庄省顺和县爆炸了一家供伪军用的咖啡店，炸死炸伤二十一人，其中包括伪村长、伪军、伪民卫队和伪警察。（附图片）
