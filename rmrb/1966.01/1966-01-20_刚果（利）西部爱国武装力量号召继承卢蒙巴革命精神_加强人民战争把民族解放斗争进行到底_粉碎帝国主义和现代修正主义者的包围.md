    Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 19th - A statement issued by the Patriotic Armed Forces in Western Congo (Kinshasa) on the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Congolese (Kinshasa) national hero Lumumba calls on the Congolese (Kinshasa) patriotic armed forces and people to inherit Lumumba's revolutionary spirit, crush the conspiracies of imperialists and modern revisionists, and carry the struggle through to the end through people's war.

    The statement said that on the fifth anniversary of Lumumba's assassination, "in order to pay tribute to our leader, we consider it necessary to condemn the defeatist sentiments spread within our ranks by the enemies of the Congolese people. The enemies of the Congolese people are also the accomplices in the crisis our country is experiencing."

    The statement condemned certain Congolese, supported by imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists, for trying to cover up their shameful betrayal by insisting that Lumumba did not advocate armed struggle or revolutionary violence.

    The statement said that in reality, after the traitor Kasavubu illegally "dismissed" Lumumba from the position of Prime Minister in September 1960, Lumumba, who was already under house arrest, entrusted his assistant to go to Stanleyville in order to prepare for armed resistance against the puppet regime forcibly established in Leopoldville. It was originally agreed that Lumumba would go to Stanleyville to lead the people's armed resistance. The statement said, "However, the Khrushchev revisionists, whom our people unfortunately did not understand at the time, know better than anyone the true reasons for Lumumba's tragic death and the failure of our resistance in Stanleyville.

      "The people of all countries, especially our people, know that in the eyes of modern revisionists, there is no distinction between a just war and an unjust war of plunder.

      "The people of all countries, especially our people, also know that Khrushchev revisionists carry out demoralizing propaganda against wars of liberation in order to spiritually disarm the people of all countries in struggle. They do not try to conceal their betrayal behind the great revolutionary Lumumba."

    The statement said, "Our people, having accumulated their own experience in fighting in various forms over the past five years, will never again welcome the United Nations' intervention in the Congo, and will never accept any kind of national reconciliation advocated by modern revisionists. The revolutionary people of the Congo will never embrace the murderers of Lumumba.

      "Therefore, grasping these negative experiences and loyal to Lumumba's policies, the Mulele brothers bravely launched an armed struggle, which has now become a reality in the country.

      "Therefore, our people, under the banner of the National Liberation Committee, are bravely fighting the lackeys of U.S. imperialism -- the Leopoldville puppets."

    The statement said, "We have many enemies at home and abroad. They come to us under various disguises. But, as our great leader Lumumba said, 'If we remain united and loyal, then the various conspiracies of imperialism to create discord in our ranks and incite nationalists against each other will be defeated.'

      "If we strengthen our ranks for unity in revolutionary action, then we will surely be able to crush the double encirclement of imperialists and modern revisionists, and in this way, we will pay reverent tribute to Lumumba, who was brutally murdered by our enemies.

    "There can be no compromise with the reactionaries! The imperialists are already trembling in the face of our struggle and fully realize that Lumumba, though dead, is more powerful than when he was alive. Patrice is dead, but his indomitable spirit will guide us to fight for the restoration of our sovereignty."

    The statement "issues an urgent and enthusiastic appeal to all fighters in the armed struggle of the Congolese people, so as to revive and produce a huge response to the revolutionary propositions announced by our national hero through general mobilization, which is: to strengthen united action, to strengthen our determination to carry the struggle through to the end through people's war."

      "We are by no means isolated. Africa and Asia will always stand by the millions of Congolese, who will only stop fighting on the day when there are no more colonizers and their mercenaries in our country." (Attached picture)

### 刚果（利）西部爱国武装力量号召继承卢蒙巴革命精神  加强人民战争把民族解放斗争进行到底  粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义者的包围

    刚果（利）西部爱国武装力量号召继承卢蒙巴革命精神
    加强人民战争把民族解放斗争进行到底
    粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义者的包围
    新华社十九日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果（利）西部爱国武装力量在刚果（利）民族英雄卢蒙巴被害五周年的时候发表声明，号召刚果（利）爱国武装力量和人民继承卢蒙巴的革命精神，粉碎帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的阴谋，通过人民战争把斗争进行到底。
    声明说，在卢蒙巴被害五周年之际，“为了向我们的领袖致敬，我们认为有必要谴责刚果人民的敌人在我们队伍内散布的失败主义情绪。刚果人民的敌人也就是我国经历着的危机的共谋者”。
    声明谴责某些受到帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者支持的刚果人为了掩饰他们可耻的叛变，硬说什么卢蒙巴不主张武装斗争，也不主张革命暴力。
    声明说，实际情况是，在叛徒卡萨武布在一九六○年九月非法“解除”卢蒙巴的总理职务后，当时已经被软禁的卢蒙巴就委托他的助手前往斯坦利维尔，以便准备武装抵抗在利奥波德维尔强行建立的傀儡政权。本来约定由卢蒙巴去斯坦利维尔领导人民的武装抵抗。声明说，“但是，我国人民当时不幸还不了解的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，他们比任何人都了解卢蒙巴悲惨的死和我们在斯坦利维尔进行抵抗的失败的真正原因。
      “世界各国人民，特别是我国人民都知道，在现代修正主义者看来，正义战争和非正义的掠夺战争之间没有任何区别。 
      “世界各国人民，特别是我国人民还知道，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为反对解放战争而进行败坏士气的宣传，以便在精神上解除斗争中的各国人民的武装。他们不用设法掩饰他们在伟大的革命者卢蒙巴背后进行的叛变。”
    声明说，“我国人民，在过去五年以各种形式进行斗争而积累了自己的经验，（他们）永远再不会欢迎联合国插手刚果，永远再不会接受现代修正主义者所主张的任何一种全国和解。刚果的革命人民永远不会拥抱杀害卢蒙巴的凶手。
      “因此，掌握了这些反面经验并忠实于卢蒙巴政策的谬勒尔兄弟英勇地发动了武装斗争，现在这个斗争已经成为国内的现实。
      “因此，我国人民在全国解放委员会的旗帜下，英勇地同美帝国主义的走狗——利奥波德维尔傀儡进行战斗。”
    声明说，“我们有许多国内外敌人。他们披着各种外衣来到我们这里。但是，我们的伟大领袖卢蒙巴说得好：‘如果我们保持团结和忠诚，那么帝国主义企图在我们队伍中制造不和、煽动民族主义者相互对立的种种阴谋必将遭到失败’。
      “如果我们为了在革命行动中的统一而加强我们的队伍，那么我们就一定能够粉碎帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的双重包围，这样，我们就是对被我们的敌人野蛮杀害的卢蒙巴的崇敬的追念。
    “同反动派决不能妥协！帝国主义者已经在我们的斗争面前发抖，并且完全认识到，卢蒙巴虽死，但是他比生前更强大。帕特里斯死了，但是，他不屈的精神将引导着我们为恢复我们的主权而斗争。”
    声明“向刚果人民的武装斗争的所有战士们发出紧迫和满怀热情的呼吁，以便通过总动员来使我们民族英雄所宣布的革命主张复活并产生巨大反响，这种总动员是：加强统一行动，加强我们通过人民战争把斗争进行到底的决心”。
      “我们决不是孤立的。非洲和亚洲将永远站在千百万刚果人一边，刚果人只有在我国不再有殖民者和他们的雇佣军的那一天才会停止斗争。”（附图片）
