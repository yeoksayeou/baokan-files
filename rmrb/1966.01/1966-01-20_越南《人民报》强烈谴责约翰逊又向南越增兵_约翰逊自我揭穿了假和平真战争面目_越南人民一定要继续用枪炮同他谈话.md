    The People's Daily of Vietnam Strongly Condemns Johnson's Further Troop Increase to South Vietnam
    Johnson Self-Exposes His False Peace, True War Face
    The Vietnamese People Must Continue to Talk to Him with Guns
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 19) The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* published a commentary on January 19, strongly condemning the Johnson administration for recently sending an additional 8,500 U.S. troops to South Vietnam under the guise of "peace talks."
    The commentary, titled "Johnson Himself Exposes His False Peace Face," said that in order to respond to the Johnson administration's actions of strengthening and expanding the war of aggression, the Vietnamese people must continue to talk to them with guns and ammunition. This conversation will only end when the U.S. imperialists' ambition to invade Vietnam is destroyed.
    The commentary said that while Johnson's "envoys" were being sent around the world peddling the "peace" hoax, U.S. generals were rushing to Saigon to discuss plans to strengthen the war. At the same time, the United States and its puppet troops, together with the puppet army, launched a series of large-scale "sweeps" against some areas of South Vietnam. They blatantly implemented the "burn all, kill all, destroy all" policy, massively expanded the use of poison gas and chemical poisons, massacred the Vietnamese people, and regarded this action as an "established principle."
    The commentary said that the U.S. aggressors also dispatched aircraft to strengthen reconnaissance activities over North Vietnam and threatened to carry out more intense bombing. They clamored to expand the war of aggression against Laos and spread the war to Cambodia.
    The commentary emphasized that Johnson speaks of false peace but engages in true war. The insipid "negotiation" perfume cannot mask the war-monger's strong smell of gunpowder. The Johnson-McNamara group is demonstrating their aggressive ambitions with practical actions, rather than a desire to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue.
    The commentary reiterated that in order to fight for independence and freedom, the Vietnamese people are prepared to fight for five, ten, twenty years or longer. Even two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, or five hundred thousand U.S. troops cannot save them from their shameful fate of defeat. 1965 proved this, and 1966 will prove it even more forcefully.

    越南《人民报》强烈谴责约翰逊又向南越增兵
    约翰逊自我揭穿了假和平真战争面目
    越南人民一定要继续用枪炮同他谈话
    据新华社河内十九日电　越南《人民报》十九日发表评论，强烈谴责约翰逊政府在“和谈”烟幕的掩盖下，最近又向越南南方增派八千五百名美军。
    这篇题为《约翰逊自己揭穿了自己的假和平面目》的评论说，为了回答约翰逊政府强化和扩大侵略战争的行动，越南人民一定要继续以枪炮、弹药来同他们进行谈话。只有在美帝国主义侵略越南的野心被摧毁的时候，这种谈话才会结束。
    评论说，当约翰逊的“特使”们被派到世界各地兜售“和平”骗局的时候，美国将领们却匆匆忙忙地跑到西贡讨论有关强化战争的计划；同时，美国及其仆从军队，还同伪军一起对越南南方一些地区展开了一系列大规模的“扫荡”。他们明目张胆地实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”政策，大规模地扩大使用毒气和化学毒药，杀害越南人民，并把这一行动看作是“既定的原则”。
    评论说，美国侵略者还派遣飞机加强对越南北方的侦察活动，并恫吓说将要进行更加猛烈的轰炸。他们叫嚷着要扩大侵略老挝的战争和使战争蔓延到柬埔寨。
    评论着重指出，约翰逊说的是假和平，而搞的是真战争。无味的“谈判”香水掩盖不住战争贩子的浓烈的火药味。约翰逊—麦克纳马拉集团正在以实际行动来表明他们的侵略野心，而不是有和平解决越南问题的愿望。
    评论重申，为了争取独立和自由，越南人民准备进行五年、十年、二十年或更长时间的战斗。即使二十万、三十万或五十万美军也挽救不了他们可耻的失败的命运。一九六五年证明了这一点，一九六六年将更加有力地证明这一点。
