    Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: Over the past year, many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have learned a great deal from local areas through political camping. The broad masses of commanders and fighters have taken the time to go to the countryside, engaging in activities such as visits and inviting local cadres and advanced producers to give reports, wholeheartedly learning good ideologies, good styles, and good experiences from local areas. This has not only further strengthened military-government and military-civilian unity but has also played a good role in promoting the revolutionization of the troops.

    Since Comrade Lin Biao issued instructions on highlighting politics last year, many grassroots units of the PLA’s army, navy, and air force have taken the initiative to learn from local areas as part of highlighting politics. Whether it was offices or companies, they went to the countryside to hold political camping. They took the fields and villages as classrooms, and invited local cadres and commune members as teachers, learning the revolutionary spirit of the people in their class struggles, production struggles, and scientific experiments. Many troops in Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan, and other places went to the Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, and other Dazhai-style model units. Through activities such as working with commune members and holding discussions, they learned the commune members' thought of "all work is for the revolution" and the fearless revolutionary heroism in conquering nature. Since 1964, the "Heroic Eighth Company" of a certain unit of the Beijing Troops, proceeding from the specific situation of the company and with questions in mind, visited the Dazhai Brigade three times, learning more deeply and gaining more each time. In 1964, they went to Dazhai twice for camping, learning the Dazhai people's revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work. They used this spirit in the company's construction, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and better completed their tasks. At the end of the year, they were again rated as a "Four-Good Company," and many soldiers were also again rated as "Five-Good Soldiers." In 1965, they visited the Dazhai Brigade again with the question of how to continue to advance in the face of achievements and honors. Chen Yonggui, the Party Branch Secretary of the Dazhai Brigade, told everyone that advanced units must have a one-divides-into-two viewpoint, seeing both achievements and shortcomings, and always remember the saying "there is always a higher heaven and a higher mountain," constantly revolutionizing and constantly advancing! These words gave the Eighth Company cadres and fighters great inspiration and education. After returning from the visit, the Eighth Company Party Branch organized all cadres and fighters to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind," mobilized the masses, examined the weak links of the company from bottom to top, and sought ways to overcome them and find directions for effort. They also sent representatives to fraternal companies to learn and solicit opinions, and posted various opinions and suggestions from inside and outside the company in the company history exhibition room, placing them in prominent positions alongside award flags and certificates. The cadres and fighters of the entire company became more modest and eager to learn in the face of honor. At the end of the year, they were again rated as a "Four-Good Company," and more than 85% of the soldiers in the entire company were rated as "Five-Good Soldiers." The Red Seventh Company of a certain regiment of the Shenyang Troops went to Taipingzhuang, a Dazhai-style advanced unit on the agricultural front in Heilongjiang Province, for camping, learning the advanced deeds of the Taipingzhuang people in building the former "naked village" into a "happy village" with a daring and determined revolutionary spirit. After returning from learning, the enthusiasm of cadres and fighters for studying Chairman Mao's works was even higher, and military training was full of vigor. At the end of the year, they were rated as a "Four-Good Company." The Communication Battalion of a certain unit of the Navy went to Xia Dingjia Brigade, the "Dazhai" of Shandong Province, for camping last year. From the advanced deeds of the Xia Dingjia people in relying on their own efforts to change the world and win bumper harvests, the cadres and fighters realized that the reason why the Xia Dingjia people had achieved such great achievements was that they held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, they took the Xia Dingjia people as an example, found the gaps in their thinking and style, and enabled the company to study Chairman Mao's works more deeply and use them more flexibly.

    During political camping, many troops also used the struggle deeds of the people in the old revolutionary base areas during the revolutionary war years as the best teaching material for studying Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. Last year, some commanders and fighters of the "Linfen Brigade" of a certain unit of the Nanjing Troops went to Banta Ji in a certain place in Anhui for camping. This was part of the Huainan Anti-Japanese Democratic Base Area established under the personal leadership of Comrade Liu Shaoqi during the Anti-Japanese War. Here, they visited the house where Comrade Liu Shaoqi lived at the time and invited old militiamen to introduce the deeds of the masses cooperating with the New Fourth Army in fighting the enemy, receiving a vivid education on the thought of people's war. The leading organs of the Beijing Troops recently went to Beiloushan Village in the Langya Mountain area of Hebei Province for camping and listened to many stories of local people cooperating with the troops to eliminate the enemy during the revolutionary war years, which was greatly encouraging. The cadres and fighters unanimously stated that they would bear in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the glorious tradition of people's war, and resolutely wipe out the enemy in the vast ocean of people's war if they dared to invade. Last autumn, some students from a certain school of the Air Force visited Baiyangdian, the base area of the famous waterborne anti-Japanese guerrillas, and further realized that people are the decisive factor in war.

    The young soldiers in various troops grew up in the new society and do not fully understand the suffering of the working people in the old society. During camping training, they invite poor and lower-middle peasants to talk about their family history and the class oppression and exploitation they suffered in the old society to raise their class consciousness. During political camping, a certain regiment of the Guangzhou Troops actively organized cadres and fighters to talk with poor and lower-middle peasants and compiled the talk records into 136 copies of the blood and tears history of poor and lower-middle peasants as living teaching materials for class education in the troops. After studying these materials, the soldiers said that in order to prevent the working people from suffering a second time, they would resolutely hold their guns tightly and carry the revolution through to the end. Many units of the Air Force organized pilots to go to the countryside for political camping, listen to poor and lower-middle peasants recount the bitterness of the old society and talk about the happy life of today, which greatly educated the pilots. The troops in Fuzhou, Kunming, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia also used rural and pastoral areas as classrooms for conducting class education in the troops. During political camping, they improved the class consciousness of the troops through activities such as visiting the poor and asking about their suffering and visiting rural class education exhibitions.

    解放军许多部队在野营中突出政治的一项重要活动
    热情向地方学好思想好作风好经验
    新华社三十日讯　过去一年里，中国人民解放军许多部队通过政治野营向地方学习，收获很大。广大指战员抽出一定时间前往农村，通过参观访问、请地方干部和先进生产者作报告等活动，满腔热情地学习地方的好思想、好作风、好经验，不但进一步加强了军政、军民团结，对部队革命化建设也起了很好的促进作用。
    去年，林彪同志提出突出政治的指示以后，人民解放军陆海空军各部队的许多基层单位，都把主动、深入地向地方学习，作为突出政治的一项内容。不论机关、连队，纷纷前往农村，举行政治野营。他们以田头村寨为课堂，请地方干部和社员为教师，学习各地人民群众在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中的革命精神。北京、沈阳、济南等地许多部队，有的到了山西省昔阳县大寨大队，有的到了各地大寨式的典型单位，通过和社员一起劳动、座谈等活动，学习社员“一切工作都是为了革命”的思想和在征服自然中不怕天、不怕地的大无畏的革命英雄气概。北京部队某部“英雄八连”一九六四年以来，从连队的具体情况出发，带着问题，三次访问大寨大队，一次比一次学得深，收获大。一九六四年，他们两次到大寨野营，学习了大寨人自力更生、艰苦创业的革命精神，并且把这种精神用在连队建设中，不怕苦，不怕累，更好地完成了各项任务，年终再次被评为四好连队，许多战士也再次被评为五好战士。一九六五年，他们又带着在成绩和荣誉面前应该如何继续前进的问题，访问了大寨大队。大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵告诉大家，先进单位一定要有一分为二的观点，既看到成绩，也看到缺点，并且时刻记住“天外还有天，山外还有山”这句话，不断革命，不断前进！这些话，给了八连干部战士很大的启发和教育。参观访问回来后，八连党支部几次组织全体干部战士学习毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，发动群众，自下而上地检查连队的薄弱环节，想克服办法，找努力方向。他们还多次派出代表到兄弟连队学习和征求意见，并且把连队内外的各种意见和建议，张贴在连史展览室内，和奖旗奖状一起放在显著地位。全连干部、战士在荣誉面前，更加虚心好学，年底又被评为四好连队，全连有百分之八十五以上的战士被评为五好战士。沈阳部队某团红七连到黑龙江省农业战线上大寨式的先进典型单位太平庄野营，学习太平庄人民以敢闯敢干的革命精神，把昔日的“光腚屯”建设成“幸福屯”的先进事迹。学习回去后，干部战士学习毛主席著作的热情更高，军事训练干劲十足，年终被评为四好连队。海军某部通讯营，去年到山东省的“大寨”——下丁家大队野营，从下丁家人民自力更生、改天换地夺丰收的先进事迹中，干部战士们认识到，下丁家人民所以取得这样大的成就，是他们高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚决按毛主席指示办事的结果。于是，他们以下丁家人民为榜样，找出自己在思想上、作风上的差距，使连队把毛主席著作学得更深，用得更活。
    在政治野营中，许多部队还把革命战争年代的老根据地人民的斗争事迹，作为学习毛主席人民战争思想的最好教材。南京部队某部“临汾旅”部分指战员，去年到安徽某地半塔集野营。这是抗日战争时期刘少奇同志亲自领导建立的淮南抗日民主根据地的一部分。他们在这里参观了刘少奇同志当年住过的房子，请当年的老民兵介绍群众配合新四军同敌人战斗的事迹，受到了一次生动的人民战争思想教育。北京部队领导机关最近到河北省狼牙山区的北娄山村野营，听了许多当地人民群众在革命战争年代配合部队消灭敌人的故事，受到很大的鼓舞。干部战士一致表示，要牢记毛主席的教导，发扬人民战争的光荣传统，敌人胆敢来犯，就坚决把它消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海中。空军某学校的部分学员，去秋访问了著名的水上抗日游击队的根据地白洋淀，进一步认识到人是战争的决定因素。
    各部队年青的战士，是在新社会长大的，不完全了解旧社会劳动人民的苦难，在野营训练中，他们就请贫下中农讲家史，讲他们在旧社会受的阶级压迫和剥削，提高自己的阶级觉悟。广州部队某团在政治野营中，积极组织干部、战士和贫下中农交谈，并且把谈话记录整理成了一百三十六份贫下中农血泪史，作为部队进行阶级教育的活教材。战士们学了这些材料后表示，为了劳动人民不受二次苦，坚决紧握枪杆，将革命进行到底。空军部队许多单位组织飞行员到农村政治野营，听贫下中农诉旧社会苦，谈今日幸福生活，使飞行员受到很大教育。福州、昆明和新疆、内蒙古地区的部队，也把农村、牧区作为对部队进行阶级教育的课堂，在政治野营中，通过访贫问苦，参观农村阶级教育展览会等活动，提高部队的阶级觉悟。
