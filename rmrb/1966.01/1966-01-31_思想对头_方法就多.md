    In recent years, agricultural production in Zhouqu County has developed rapidly. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee.

    In previous years, we always felt that we were "almost there," so we were satisfied with the status quo and blindly optimistic. As a result, our production methods were outdated and our work style was mediocre. We were busy, but our achievements were not significant. In the spring of 1964, according to the spirit of the provincial party committee meeting, we realized that we had fallen behind. We began to see the county party committee's self-imposed limitations and complacency. Especially after learning from the experiences of other places, we felt that our gap was very large. We were not "almost there," but far behind, and we were determined to catch up.

    When the guiding ideology is correct, the working methods also increase. There are fewer people sitting in offices making phone calls, and more people going deep into the grassroots to investigate and set up demonstration sites. Since the spring of last year, generally only one member of the standing committee has been left at home to preside over the work, while the others have gone down to the grassroots to set up demonstration sites. Some meetings have also been moved to the demonstration sites, so that we can get closer to reality and guide the work more effectively. The leadership style of the county party committee has changed, and the mental state of cadres at all levels and the masses has also changed accordingly, setting off a production upsurge of tapping potential and striving for bumper harvests. Therefore, despite suffering from major disasters such as drought, flood, hail, flood, and disease, the county's grain yield per mu still increased by 8.38 percent compared to the previous year, and the total output increased by 8.25 percent. Animal husbandry and sideline production also saw a substantial increase.

    思想对头  方法就多
    近几年来，舟曲县的农业生产发展较快，原因是多方面的，但主要的是县委思想革命化。
    前几年，我们总觉得“差不多了”，因此满足现状，盲目乐观，结果是生产方法老一套，工作作风一般化，忙忙碌碌，成绩不大。一九六四年春天，根据省委会议精神，我们感到自己已经落后了，开始看到县委领导上的故步自封、骄傲自满情绪，特别是学习了外地经验后，觉得自己差距很大，不是“差不多了”，而是差得很远，下定决心要跟上去。
    指导思想对头了，工作方法也跟着多了，坐机关摇电话的少了，深入基层蹲点调查的多了。前年
        春天以来，一般只留一个常委在家主持工作，其余下到基层蹲点搞样板，有些会议也搬在点上召开，这样接近实际指导工作也有力了。县委的领导作风转变了，各级干部和群众的精神状态也随着变化，掀起了挖潜力、争丰收的生产高潮。因此，在遭受了较大的旱、涝、雹、洪、病等灾害情况下，全县粮食单产仍比上年增长百分之八点三八，总产增长百分之八点二五。牧业、副业生产也有了大幅度的增长。
