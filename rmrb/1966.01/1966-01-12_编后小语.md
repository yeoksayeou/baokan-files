    The three articles published in today's newspaper discuss the experiences of developing mass amateur creative writing and the methods of cultivating new literary talents. Because of the differences in regions and units, and the different specific circumstances, their experiences and methods also vary. However, one point is common to all: highlighting politics.
    The Beijing Military Region adopted the method of "selection," "help," and "awards," with political command running through every link. The Beijing People's Printing Plant's experience of "grasping the team," "grasping ideology," and "grasping creation" takes grasping politics as its main focus in every aspect. Highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest combat power and the highest guiding principle for all work.
    All revolutionary work cannot be separated from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and literary work is a part of the revolutionary cause, so of course it cannot be separated from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Countless facts show that deviating from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will lead to detours and deviations; conversely, reading Chairman Mao's books and doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions can vigorously develop mass amateur creative writing and cultivate more and better new literary talents.
    Making literature the cause of thousands upon thousands of the masses is something that predecessors have never done. In this regard, our experience is not yet rich, our methods are not yet numerous, and there are few things we can learn from. How to adapt to the needs of the revolutionary situation? Only by using Mao Zedong Thought on the basis of practice, constantly summing up our own experience, and constantly drawing on the experience of others, can we create and make progress.
    The current situation is very good. As long as we correctly implement the Party's policies and guidelines, highlight politics, and create effective methods according to the specific conditions of our units, we believe that the work of developing the amateur creative writing of workers, peasants, and soldiers and cultivating successors to the proletarian literature and art will surely see a more vigorous new situation.

    编后小语
    今天本报发表的三篇文章，谈的是发展群众业余创作的经验，造就文艺新人的方法。因为地区的不同，单位的不同，具体情况的不同，他们的经验、方法也有所不同。但是，有一点却是共同的，这就是突出政治。
    北京部队采取“选”、“帮”、“奖”的办法，每一个环节都贯串着政治挂帅；北京人民印刷厂“抓队伍”、“抓思想”、“抓创作”的经验，每一项都以抓政治为主。突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想，是最大的战斗力，是指导一切工作的最高指针。
    一切革命工作离不开毛泽东思想的指导，文艺工作是革命事业的一部分，当然也离不开毛泽东思想的指导。无数事实表明，离开毛泽东思想指导，就会走弯路，出偏差；反之，读毛主席的书，按照毛主席的指示去做，就能蓬蓬勃勃地发展群众业余创作，更多更好地造就文艺新人。
    使文艺成为千千万万群众的事业，这是前人所没有做过的事情。在这方面，我们的经验还不丰富，办法还不多，可以借鉴的东西也很少。怎样去适应革命形势的需要？只有在实践的基础上，运用毛泽东思想，不断总结自己的经验，不断汲取别人的经验，才能有所创造，有所前进。
    目前形势很好，只要我们正确执行党的方针政策，突出政治，根据本单位的具体情况，创造行之有效的方法，我们相信，发展工农兵群众的业余创作，造就无产阶级文艺接班人的工作，就一定会出现更加生气蓬勃的新局面。
