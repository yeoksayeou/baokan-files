    Storms are tightening, sweeping across the African continent. This is a story recounted by a patriot from the storm's center, Congo (Leopoldville). This patriot rolled around in the storm, his face bearing the colors of wind and cloud, both passionate and somber. He has a name, a rather resounding one, but he must constantly change it, hiding his footsteps. He is young, as young as his country. He speaks of his childhood, a childhood like that of millions of Congolese, sprinkled with the blood and tears of slavery. He speaks of Lumumba's death, a hero's death like a thunderclap, shaking the mountains and rivers of the Congo, stirring up an even more urgent storm of wind and rain. The patriot's story begins here...

          Hesitation

    Forgive me if my emotions are somewhat agitated. Please think, the independence and freedom that the Congolese people fought for with their lives, shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, had only just been born on June 30, 1960, when our national hero Lumumba was murdered by American executioners through the trick of using a borrowed knife. With Lumumba's death, the Congo was once again plunged into deep disaster. Countless revolutionaries were arrested, some disappeared without a trace, gone forever.

    I was one of the leaders of the youth movement, and at the time, I felt extreme grief and indignation. I gathered some like-minded people to form the Lumumba Nationalist Youth Organization, raising the banner of the martyrs. Among these, I should name a youth leader. His name was Kasenga, a man of few words, worthy of the description "wise and brave." We vehemently opposed another sinister scheme that the American bosses and their various lackeys were playing – "National Reconciliation."

    Unfortunately, many members of parliament in the Gizenga government in Stanleyville at the time actually supported "reconciliation." If the members of parliament all agreed, what could be done? Gizenga was finally tricked into going to Leopoldville and thrown into prison.

    A new wave of arrests began, and I too fell into misfortune. Lying in the hot and humid prison, looking at the pitch-black night sky on the equator, my heart ached: Congo! Congo! Are you to be forever trapped in an abyss of eternal change, without light! The night will eventually end, and the Congo will awaken. I cannot sit and wait for death; I must take action. Taking advantage of this dark and windy night, with the help of a kind-hearted jailer, I climbed over the high walls of the prison and escaped from the wolf's den.

    As a revolutionary, I am not afraid of a life of difficult and hardship exile. What I fear is being like a lonely boat, drifting in all directions, perhaps losing its way. In exile, I actually met my comrade Kasenga again, in a remote city of the Congo. Kasenga's situation seemed also difficult. His clothes were tattered. His beard was long, but his demeanor was calm and composed, not losing his confidence in life in the slightest.

    Talking about the future destiny of the Congo, Kasenga was silent for a long time, then said simply and concisely: "We are all exploring the road to saving the motherland, but unfortunately, we have taken the wrong steps repeatedly. Now, we should go abroad to seek out true friends. The truth will eventually be grasped by us."

    After hasty preparations, Kasenga one day secretly crossed the turbulent Congo River and flew far away. Before parting, I held him tightly, face to face, and said: "Remember your country, your brothers, we are waiting for you to return soon."

    Kasenga did not return. A month, a year, no news. During this time, I wandered around, from east to west, from south to north. I once taught, enlightening the youth's consciousness. I also gathered some patriotic youth to start newspapers, attacking the traitorous puppet regime. My country sank deeper and deeper, completely falling into the hands of the new colonialist demons. I am very young, full of strength, but I don't know where to use it; I have a loyal heart and want to serve my country eagerly, but what should I do!

    With this state of mind, I came to Albertville. It was March 1964, sometimes cloudy, sometimes sunny, the rainy season nearing its end. Albertville is an important town on the eastern border of the Congo, close to the vast Lake Tanganyika, densely populated. Every morning, fishermen return from the lake in dugout canoes, their boats filled with fish, shimmering like small pieces of silver. I often come to trade for some fish to sell in the market, both to hide my identity and to make a living.

    One foggy day, I was waiting for the fishing boats by the lake when a boat broke through the thick fog and docked. A man jumped off the boat, short and stocky, with a very familiar look. Guess who it was? My dear Kasenga! He crossed Lake Tanganyika through the night fog, stepping back onto the troubled Congo. He looked a little tired, but his spirits were exceptionally high. Where had he been for more than a year?

    Kasenga sat on the bed in my residence and began to talk about his experience. He had been to some African countries and received the support of the people of various countries for the Congo's struggle. He left Africa, crossed the ocean, and went to the far, far away Asia, where he found more warm-blooded friends who sincerely cared about the fate of the Congolese people. Kasenga said with excitement: "For many years, we have been pursuing the road of freedom and liberation, groping forward, and stumbled many times. Now, I have finally discovered the truth of the revolution."

    I asked eagerly: "What exactly is the truth?"

    Kasenga said calmly: "The truth is also very simple, that is: independence and freedom can never be begged from imperialism and its lackeys. We must fight. We are facing the most vicious American imperialism, which has all kinds of accomplices and the United Nations as its tool. What should we do?"

    Yes, this is exactly the question I have been pondering day and night.

    Kasenga lowered his voice and said: "The only way now is armed struggle."

    When I heard this, my whole body felt hot, and I felt like a torch burning.

          Uprising

    In fact, someone has already been clearing the way, paving the way forward. In September 1963, an armed struggle had already broken out in the heartland of Leopoldville Province. Now, it is carrying out ingenious guerrilla warfare deep in the forest, creating large areas of base areas. Without armed struggle, we really have no way to go. At this time, many revolutionaries had gradually flowed into Albertville. Everyone followed Kasenga's idea, dividing up to organize the masses. I am still a fishmonger, traveling around every day, quietly spreading the truth of the revolution to the masses, igniting the sparks buried in their hearts. While planning, we received another exciting piece of news: in the Uvira area at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, the revolutionaries also raised the banner of armed struggle.

    I became anxious and said: "If they can fight, why can't we? Revolution is not carving a portrait; we can't just hold a piece of ebony and weigh it left and right."

    Someone hesitated and said: "We don't have a single gun. How can we fight?"

    Kasenga said in a low and powerful voice: "There are plenty of guns. It just depends on whether you have the courage to take them."

    Immediately, a leading committee was organized, with Kasenga, me, and some comrades from Gabru participating. Everyone hid in the reeds by the lake, quietly discussing the plan for the uprising. …

    One late night in late May 1964, the rainy season had just passed, the night sky was very clear, and the weather was cool. The entire city of Albertville had fallen into a slumber. The only ones awake were a group of us. We were empty-handed, lined up in a single file, bent over, and quietly approached the barracks of the local puppet army, lying down in the grass, afraid to move. A sentry was standing at the entrance of the barracks, constantly yawning loudly.

    Suddenly, someone stood up from the end of our line, his bare feet heavily treading on the ground, and walked towards the sentry. I broke out in a sweat, unable to stop him. The person was a boatman on the lake, who had volunteered to participate in tonight's uprising. But what was he going to do? The boatman seemed to have had too much to drink, his words were slurred and unclear. He told the sentry that he had gone to the countryside to see his mother-in-law, and on the way back, he encountered a zebra, chased the zebra, got lost, and almost couldn't find his way back to the city. When he reached the sentry, the boatman took out a cigarette, asked the sentry for a light, and handed a cigarette to the sentry, saying: "Have one, it will relieve your fatigue." Unexpectedly, he snatched the sentry's gun and whispered, "Don't move!"

    We jumped forward one after another, immediately forcing the sentry to lead the way. The sentry was frightened, obedient, and led us all the way to the entrance of the barracks.

    We shouted at the barracks: "Don't move! You are surrounded!" Then we rushed in, and many flashlights shone everywhere, illuminating the group of puppet soldiers huddled on their beds, shaking like dry leaves in the wind, begging for mercy, saying repeatedly: "We are not officers."

    I shouted: "Quickly lead us to capture the officers, it's none of your business." Then, I ordered everyone to confiscate the guns. After confiscating the guns, everyone was in high spirits. In a short while, all the officers were captured.

    This was a mountain collapse, an earth split, the entire city was shaken. At dawn, countless people flocked to the front of the leading committee, demanding that guns be issued to them to avenge Lumumba. There were plenty of guns, and they were immediately issued to the people. The people cheered, holding their guns high, and enthusiastically dancing the heroic warrior dance. But the masses didn't know how to use the guns, and they couldn't even load the bullets. Ah, how stupid, why not ask the ready-made teachers. So they went to ask those imprisoned puppet officers.

    Speaking of being imprisoned, in fact, those officers could still freely communicate with the outside world. One of our comrades said to them: "From now on, you no longer belong to the reactionary government, but are soldiers of the people's army." He wanted to induce them to stand on the side of the people. The officers behaved very obediently and were very friendly, patiently teaching the masses how to fire guns, and asking: "You have fought so many battles, how come you are not used to using guns?"

    The masses said: "We are new to this, who can get used to it?"

    The officers secretly complained: Last night, they were shouting everywhere, thinking that thousands of troops had been sent from other places, but it turned out to be a motley crowd, cheating everywhere.

    Seeing that the situation had opened up, the leading committee was naturally elated, and they were busy discussing future plans. It was decided to immediately send Kasenga to contact the Uvira uprising troops; the masses were too chaotic and should be strictly organized. We thought of everything, but we didn't think of the enemies all around.

    On the third day after the uprising, I was in the leading committee with Gabru looking at a map, studying the next military deployment, when I heard a commotion in the distance, mixed with a few gunshots. In the past two days, the emotions of the masses had not calmed down, and it was not strange to fire a few empty shots. But I felt a little uneasy and asked Gabru to go outside to check the situation.

    Gabru suddenly shouted outside in a straight voice: "Lieutenant!"

    This was my rank. I jumped out of the house in response, only to see several jeeps rushing straight from the city, followed by a large group of enemies rushing towards us.

    Gabru shouted: "Go!" He himself knelt behind a large breadfruit tree, firing a submachine gun, blocking the enemy. In the chaos of gunfire, I took a few people and turned to the back of the house, and dived into a patch of low bushes. Looking back, Gabru was covered in blood, his face sideways on the ground. His eyes faced the sun, shining brightly. Farewell, my brother! The life you gave for the revolution will forever shine red in the history of the Congo.

    I didn't escape, and was captured on the road.

    On the same day, the puppet reinforcements sent from Elisabethville occupied the entire city, and the entire black area became a massacre field, with blood spurting like a fountain. …

          Setback

    Sitting in the black prison, I held my head in my hands, my thoughts were unusually calm. The events of the past few days seemed like a play. I am not afraid of failure, but I am saddened by the inexcusable mistakes. We actually believed those fake military officers, thinking that they also had patriotism and could get along with them, allowing them to act freely. Later it turned out that they colluded with spies, leaked our inside information, and summoned reinforcements. We opposed the so-called "National Reconciliation," but we also had the idea of "reconciliation" towards the enemy, causing great sacrifices. Thinking about it, my heart trembled.

    I had even thought about death. Based on my actions, the enemy would surely sentence me to death. I heard a jailer secretly tell me that everyone thrown into this prison was considered a leader of the uprising. The newly appointed fake police chief had already obtained sufficient materials, and there was no need for interrogation. He was preparing to immediately escort us to Leopoldville to be sentenced to death. In fact, most of those imprisoned in the prison were the backbone of the uprising. Among them, there was a young man with sideburns who spoke particularly fiercely. He cursed: "This dog police chief! He wants to use our heads to exchange for high-ranking officials and generous salaries. I refuse to go to Leopoldville."

    Someone asked: "Can you decide whether to go or not?"

    The bearded youth explained a reason in a low voice. It turned out that the newly appointed fake garrison commander was his brother-in-law. He was suspicious and had always been at odds with the police chief. The youth bribed the jailer, sent a letter to his sister, saying that he had been framed and asked for rescue.

    One day, the garrison commander appeared in the prison, his eyes cold and cruel.

    The bearded youth complained: "What crime have I committed that you arrested me? I understand what the police chief is thinking: he doesn't want to frame me, he wants to frame you."

    The commander's eyes shot out fiercely, staring straight at the other party.

    The bearded youth continued: "If your brother-in-law rebels, can you avoid being implicated?"

    I took the opportunity to say: "That's right, if we are escorted to Leopoldville and say something unfavorable to you, you won't escape either."

    The commander roared fiercely: "Shut up, you group of death row inmates! You still want to threaten me!" He shook his hand and left.

    From then on, although the police chief wanted to escort us away several times, he had to postpone it, until mid-June. That evening, the lights in the prison suddenly went out. We thought it was a problem with the wires, but an hour, two hours… it still didn't light up. Looking at the sky above the city, it was pitch black, all the lights in the city were out.

    A jailer stumbled and ran, saying: "Bad news! Bad news! The army from Uvira has come and occupied the power station in the north."

    There was a loud noise in the prison. Someone started singing, singing an ancient Congolese love song, with melancholy mixed with joy.

    One day, two days, we faintly heard the sound of gunfire, getting closer and closer, louder and louder. We wanted to ask the jailer, but the jailer just waved his hand, afraid to say anything. We waited day and night, hoping that the Uvira people's army would enter the city soon, and we would offer them our loyal hearts. However, the bearded youth became impatient and uneasy, and jumped up as soon as the prison door rang. He gritted his teeth and cursed: "This group of jackals, I understand their methods. When the situation becomes tight, they will definitely strike first and kill us." These words made others also restless.

    Finally, one day at dawn, we woke up from a nightmare and heard a commotion on the street. Then the prison door opened, the cell door opened, and a group of people rushed into our cell. The leading person stopped at the entrance of the cell. Pale blue morning light shone in diagonally from the window, clearly outlining the person's profile.

    It was Kasenga.

        Set Sail Forward

    Albertville was liberated again, and the situation took a sharp turn. From June 1964, we gradually grew into a fairly strong force, echoing the Uvira People's Army, launching an offensive. City after city fell into our hands, including Stanleyville, a famous large city in Eastern Province. Victory lifted some people into the clouds, making them light and airy. Look, in another two months, we will send Kasavubu to accompany his American masters to be buried! What, do we still need two months? Give me a plane, I'll bomb Leopoldville tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow I'll invite you to dinner in the capital. More comrades are especially cautious. We understand: what is at odds with the Congolese people is not only a small group of national scum, but also old and new colonialism behind them, especially Uncle Sam. Victory is definitely not in the gains and losses of one city and one place, let alone something that can be achieved overnight. This will be a severe and long-term battle.

    Sure enough, in November of that year, when the equatorial rainy season came, I was handling affairs in an African country when I heard on the radio that the United States and Belgium were colluding to launch an armed invasion of the Congo, occupying Stanleyville and barbarously massacring the Congolese people. Hatred tormented my heart. The hot blood in my whole body was boiling. Robbers! Murderers! Americans! You killed Lumumba, trying to stifle the Congo's freedom! Now you are openly showing your fangs, trying to devour the Congo's revolution. The Congolese people can have their heads cut off, but their will can never be conquered. You kill one Lumumba, but thousands upon thousands of Lumumbas have grown up. Look at today's Congo, shining with Lumumba's life everywhere – in the high mountains, in the dense forests, on the plains, in the lakes and marshes – everywhere rolling with the anger of revolution. The struggle is long-term, the road is tortuous, but many revolutionary figures tempered in the struggle are mastering the compass of history in the storm, identifying the direction, and setting sail forward. …

    My story is just one person's experience, a small episode, but perhaps it can show a vague glimpse of the Congo revolution. My words are finished, but my story is not finished. The Congolese people, who control their own destiny, will surely create a brilliant ending to this story. (Attached pictures)

### 风雨横扫着非洲

    风雨横扫着非洲
    杨朔
    风雨正紧，横扫着非洲大陆。这儿记的是一个来自风暴中心刚果（利奥波德维尔）的爱国者口述的故事。这个爱国者在暴风雨中滚来滚去，脸上带着风云的气色，激昂而又沉郁。他有名有姓，名姓相当响亮，却不得不经常改名换姓，隐藏着自己的脚踪。他还年青，象他的祖国一样年青。他谈起自己的童年，他的童年象万千个刚果人一样，洒满斑斑点点奴隶的血泪。他谈到卢蒙巴的死，英雄的死象一声惊雷，震醒刚果的山川，唤起更急的雷风暴雨。爱国者的故事就从这儿起。……
          彷徨
    原谅我，如果我的情绪有些激愤。请想想，刚果人民抛头颅，洒热血，出生入死争得的独立自由刚在一九六○年六月三十日诞生，我们的民族英雄卢蒙巴就被美国刽子手用借刀杀人的手段，谋害死了。卢蒙巴一死，刚果一时又陷进深深的灾难里。无数革命者被逮捕，有的无声无息地消逝了，永远消逝了。
    我是青年运动的领导人之一，当时感到极度悲愤，纠集一些志同道合的人成立卢蒙巴民族主义青年组织，举起先烈的旗帜。这当中应该点出一个青年领袖的名字。他叫卡森加，沉默寡言，称得起智勇双全。我们激烈反对美国老板和他各色各样的奴才正在玩弄的另一奸计——“全国和解”。
    不幸的很，当时在斯坦利维尔的基赞加政府中许多国会议员竟然赞成“和解”。议员都赞成，怎么办呢？基赞加终于被骗到利奥波德维尔，投进监牢。
    新的大逮捕又开始了，我也落难。躺在闷热潮湿的监狱里，望着赤道线上漆黑的夜空，我的心痛：刚果！刚果！难道你就永久陷在万劫不变的深渊里，不见光亮！黑夜终究有个尽头，刚果会醒过来的。我不能坐着等死，我得行动起来。就趁着这个月黑风高的夜晚，借着一位热心肠的狱卒伸出的援手，我翻过监狱的高墙，逃出狼窝。
    作为一个革命者，我不怕艰难困苦的流亡生活，我怕的是自己象一叶孤舟，四处飘零，也许会迷失方向。在流亡中，我竟然又遇见我的战友卡森加，是在刚果一个边远的城市里遇见的。卡森加的境遇看来也很困难，衣服褴褛不堪。胡子多长，他的神态却从容镇静，丝毫没失去生活的信心。
    谈起刚果未来的命运，卡森加沉思不语，半晌，简单扼要地说：“我们都在探索拯救祖国的道路，不幸一再迈错步子，现在应该到国外去寻访一下真正的朋友，真理总会被我们把握住的。”
    经过草草的准备，卡森加终于一天偷偷渡过恶浪汹涌的刚果河，远走高飞了。临分手前，我紧紧抱住他，脸贴着他的脸说：“记着你的祖国，你的弟兄，我们等着你早日回来。”
    卡森加竟不回来，一月，一年，音信茫茫。在这期间，我四处流落，从东到西，从南到北，曾经教过书，启发青年的觉悟，也曾经纠合一些爱国青年，办报纸，抨击卖国求荣的傀儡政权。我的祖国却越陷越深，完全沦落到新殖民主义魔鬼的掌心里去。我很年青，一身都是力气，却不知该往哪儿使；我怀着忠肝义胆，急切想报效祖国，可是我该怎么办啊！
    怀着这种心情，我来到阿贝特维尔。正当一九六四年三月，时阴时晴，雨季接近末梢。阿贝特维尔是刚果东边国境线上一个重镇，紧临着烟波浩渺的坦噶尼喀湖，人烟稠密。天天清晨，渔人从湖上荡着独木船回来，船里装满鱼，碎银一样闪亮。我时常来贩点鱼，拿到市上去卖，一来掩住身子，二来也好糊口。
    一个大雾天，我正在湖边等候渔船，一只船冲开浓雾，拢了岸。船上跳下个人来，矮壮精干，神态十分面熟。你猜这是谁？我的亲爱的卡森加啊。他乘着夜雾横渡过坦噶尼喀湖，重新踏上多难的刚果，神色有点疲倦，情绪却异常饱满。他一去一年多，究竟到哪儿去了？
    卡森加坐到我寓所的床上，开始说起他的经历。他去过一些非洲国家，得到各国人民对刚果斗争的支持。他离开非洲，飞渡重洋大海，又去到极远极远的亚洲，在那里，他发现更多热血的朋友，真心地关怀着刚果人民的命运。卡森加精神昂奋地说：“我们多年来，追求自由解放的道路，摸索前进，跌了许多跟头，现在我到底探索到革命的真理。”
    我急切问道：“真理究竟是什么？”
    卡森加从从容容说：“真理也很简单，就是：独立自由永远也不能从帝国主义和它的走狗手里乞求得来。必须斗争。我们面对的是最恶毒的美帝国主义，它有各式各样的帮凶，它有联合国充当它的工具，我们又该怎么办呢？”
    是啊，这正是我白天黑夜焦思苦想的问题。
    卡森加压低嗓音说：“现在的道路只有一条——武装斗争。”
    我一听，浑身发烫，觉得自己象支火把似的燃烧起来。
          起　义
    其实这条路已经有人斩荆披莽，开辟着前进。一九六三年九月，一场武装斗争早在利奥波德维尔省的腹心地带爆发，如今正在森林深处开展着巧妙的游击战，创造出大片的根据地。不搞武装斗争，我们也真无路可走。这时陆陆续续流到阿贝特维尔的，已有不少革命者。大家按照卡森加的主意，分头去组织群众。我还是鱼贩子，每天四处转，悄悄向群众宣传革命的道理，煽起埋在他们心里的火花。正在策划当中，又传来一个激动人心的消息：在坦噶尼喀湖北端的乌维腊地区，革命者也扯起武装斗争的旗号。
    我急了，说：“他们能打，我们就不能打？革命也不是雕刻人头象，不能拿着块乌木左右掂量。”
    有人迟疑说：“一枝枪都没有，怎么打法？”
    卡森加用低沉有力的声音说：“枪有的是，只看你有没有胆量去拿。”
    当下组织起领导委员会，由卡森加、我、还有加布鲁一些同志参加，大家藏在湖边的芦苇丛里，悄悄商量着起义的计划。……
    一九六四年五月下旬的一个深夜，雨季刚过，夜空很晴朗，天也凉爽，阿贝特维尔全城都沉到睡梦里。不睡的只有我们一群人。我们赤手空拳，排成单行，弯着腰，悄悄摸到当地傀儡军的兵营前，伏到草丛里不敢动。兵营门口站着个哨兵，不时大声打着哈欠。
    忽然有人从我们队伍的末尾站起来了，一双赤脚重重地踩着地面，朝着哨兵走去。我急出一头汗，想止也止不住他。那人老远便向哨兵打招呼。一听声音，是湖上的一个船夫，自愿参加今晚的起事。可是他要做什么呢？那船夫想是喝多了酒，吐字含混不清，对哨兵说他到乡下去看老丈母娘，回来的路上遇见斑马，追斑马，迷了方向，差一点摸不回城。走到哨兵跟前时，那船夫掏出纸烟，向哨兵借火，又递烟给哨兵说：“抽一支吧，解解乏。”冷不防夺下哨兵的枪，低声喝道：“别动！”
    我们纷纷跳上前去，立逼着哨兵领路。那哨兵吓呆了，百依百顺，把我们一直领到营房门口。
    我们对着营房一声吆喝：“不许动！你们被包围了。”便冲进去，许多支手电筒四处闪射，照见那群傀儡兵缩在床上，抖得就象风吹的干树叶儿，一味求饶，连声说：“我们不是军官啊。”
    我喝道：“快领我们去抓军官，没你们的事。”一面指挥大家缴枪。缴到枪，个个精神抖擞，一会儿工夫所有军官都落了网。
    这是一声山崩，一声地裂，全城都震动了。天一明，无数群众拥到领导委员会门前，要求发枪给他们，替卢蒙巴复仇。枪正多，立时发给人民。人民一片欢腾，高高擎着枪，狂热地跳起英雄气魄的武士舞。可是枪怎么打法，群众不清楚，连子弹也不会压。嗐，多笨，现成的教师不去问。就去问那些被囚的傀儡军官。
    说被囚，实际上那些军官依旧可以自由自在跟外边通消息。我们一位战友对他们说：“今后你们不再属于反动政府，而是人民军队的战员了。”想诱导他们站到人民这一边。军官们表现得很顺从，也很和气，耐心地教群众放枪，一面问：“你们打那么多仗，怎么连枪都使不惯？”
    群众说：“生手乍来，谁使得惯这个？”
    军官们暗暗叫苦：昨天晚间四处喊嚷，只当是从外地杀来千军万马，原来是群乌合之众，到处行诈。
    领导委员会见局面打开，自然兴高采烈，忙着商量今后的大计。决定立刻派卡森加去跟乌维腊起义部队联络；群众太乱，也该严密组织起来。我们什么都想到，只是没想到四周围的敌人。
    起义后的第三天，我正跟加布鲁在领导委员会看地图，研究下一步的军事部署，听见远处乱嚷嚷的，夹杂着几声枪响。近两天，群众的情绪总平静不下来，放几声空枪，原不奇怪。可是我有点不安，叫加布鲁到门外去望望动静。
    加布鲁突然在门外直着嗓子喊：“少尉！”
    这是我的军衔。我应声跳出门去，只见从城市那边，几辆吉普车直撞过来，车后边是大队敌人，冲着我们扑来。
    加布鲁喊：“快走！”他自己却跪到一棵枝干粗大的面包树后，打起冲锋枪，堵住敌人。在乱枪声里，我带着几个人转到屋后，钻进一带矮树丛。回头一望，加布鲁满身是血，侧着脸扑到地上。他的眼睛迎着阳光，闪亮闪亮。永别了，我的兄弟！你为革命献出的生命，将在刚果历史上永远闪着红光。
    我并没走脱，路上被人俘虏。
    当天，从依丽沙白维尔开来的傀儡援军占领全城，整个黑人区变成大屠场，血象喷泉一样激溅着。……
          挫　折
    坐在黑牢里，我两手抱着头，思想反倒异常冷静。几天来的事情，仿佛是一场戏。我不怕失败，难过的是犯了不可饶恕的错误。我们居然会相信那些伪军官，以为他们也有爱国心，可以相处，听任他们自由行动。后来证明，是他们勾结奸细，把我们的内情透出去，召来援军。我们反对所谓“全国和解”，我们对敌人竟也存在着“和解”思想，造成极大的牺牲，想起来，心就发颤。
    死，也想过的。按我的行动而论，敌人准会判我死罪。听狱卒偷偷告诉说，凡是抛进这座监牢的，都被当做起义的领袖，新任的伪警察局长已经掌握充分的材料，也不必审问，准备立即押送到利奥波德维尔，宣判死刑。其实除我而外，狱里囚的多半只是起义的骨干分子。当中有个青年，连鬓胡须，言语特别激烈。他骂道：“这个狗警察局长！要拿我们的头，去换高官厚禄。我偏不去利奥波德维尔。”
    别人问：“去不去能依你么？”
    那胡子青年低声谈出一番道理。原来新任的伪驻军司令是他姐夫。性子多疑，跟警察局长素来不和睦。那青年就收买狱卒，带信给他姐姐，说是遭到陷害。请求援救。
    驻军司令有一天出现在监狱里，眼色冷冷的，残酷的很。
    胡子青年叫屈说：“我犯了什么罪，把我抓来？我懂得警察局长的心思：他不是要陷害我，是要陷害你。”
    那司令的眼里射出凶光，直盯着对方。
    胡子青年又说：“如果你的内弟造反，你能不受牵连？”
    我趁机说：“就是啊，如果我们押到利奥波德维尔，说出对你不利的话，你也逃不脱。”
    那司令恶狠狠地叫：“住口，你们这群死囚！还想威胁我！”一摔手走了。
    从此，尽管警察局长几次想押走我们，却又不得不拖延着，一直拖到六月中旬。那天晚间，监狱的电灯忽然灭了。原以为是电线的毛病，可是一小时，两小时……总不见亮。望望城市的上空，漆黑漆黑，全城的灯都灭了。
    一个狱卒跌跌撞撞跑着说：“坏了！坏了！乌维腊方面来了军队，占领了北面的发电站。”
    监牢里轰地一声，闹起来。有人唱起歌，唱的是刚果人求爱的古歌，忧郁里透着欢乐。
    一天、两天，隐隐约约听得见枪炮声，越逼越近，越近越响。想问狱卒，狱卒直摆手，什么不敢说。我们日夜盼望着，只盼乌维腊的人民军早日进城，我们将捧着自己的赤心，献给他们。胡子青年却变得暴躁不安，狱门一响，就跳起来。他咬着牙骂：“这群豺狼，我懂得他们的手段。情况一紧，他们必然先下毒手杀死我们。”这番话，引得别人也坐卧不安。
    终于，一天拂晓，我们从恶梦里惊醒，听见街上乱噪噪的，接着狱门打开，牢门打开，一伙人冲进我们的牢房。当头一个人停住脚，立在牢门口。淡青色的晨光从窗口斜射进来，分明托出那人的侧面。
    他是卡森加。
        扬帆前进
    阿贝特维尔重新解放，局面急转直下。从一九六四年六月起，我们逐渐壮大成一支相当坚强的队伍，跟乌维腊的人民军互相呼应，展开了攻势，城市一个接一个落进我们手里，包括东方省的著名大城市斯坦利维尔。胜利把一些人托上云彩里去，变得轻飘飘的。瞧吧，再有两个月，管教卡萨武布给他美国主子去陪葬吧！怎么，还用两个月？给我一架飞机，明天一炸利奥波德维尔，后天我请你在京城吃晚餐。更多的同志却特别慎重。我们明白：与刚果人民为敌的不只是一小撮民族败类，后头还有新老殖民主义，尤其是山姆大叔。胜利决不在一城一地的得失，更不是一朝一夕能够拿到的。这将是一场严酷而持久的战斗。
    果然，当年十一月，赤道的雨季来时，我正在一个非洲国家办理事务，听见无线电广播说：美国和比利时狼狈为奸，对刚果发动了武装侵略，占领斯坦利维尔，野蛮地屠杀着刚果人民。仇恨煎熬着我的心。我浑身的热血沸腾起来。强盗！凶手！美国佬！你杀死卢蒙巴，妄想扼杀刚果的自由！现在你又公然露出狼牙，想吞噬刚果的革命。刚果人头可断，意志却永远不能征服。你杀死一个卢蒙巴，却有千千万万个卢蒙巴成长起来了。请看今日的刚果，在高山，在密林，在平原，在湖沼，到处闪耀着卢蒙巴的生命，到处翻卷着革命的怒火。斗争是长期的，道路是曲折的，但从斗争中锻炼出的许多革命人物，正在狂风暴雨中掌握着历史的罗盘，辨认着方向，扬帆前进。……
    我的故事只是一个人的经历，一段小小的插曲，但也许可以看出刚果革命的依稀的面影。我的话完了，我的故事却没有完。掌握着自己命运的刚果人民定会给这个故事创造出光彩的结局。（附图片）
