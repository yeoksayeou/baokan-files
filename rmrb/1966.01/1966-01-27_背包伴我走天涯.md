    Backpack Accompanies Me Across the World
    Soldier Xu Zifang
    The bugle rips through the night sky,
    Groping in the dark, I pack my backpack,
    Binding in a chest full of hatred,
    Steps like shooting stars, striding forward!
    The quilt corner rolls with the South China Sea's tide,
    Iron feet clamp down on the Great Wall's sand,
    Treading mountains, treading water, treading thorns,
    My backpack accompanies me across the world.
    A backpack is a mountain,
    Fierce winds and torrential rain cannot crush it,
    The soldier is the one who carries the mountain,
    Difficulties and dangers are trampled underfoot.
    A backpack is a ball of fire,
    Just like torches,
    Hatred is its fuse,
    Transforming into a sky full of rosy clouds!

    背包伴我走天涯
    战士　徐子芳
    军号划破长空夜，
    摸黑我把背包打，
    捆进满胸仇和恨，
    步似流星向前跨！
    被角卷着南海潮，
    铁脚夹着长城沙，
    踏山踏水踏荆棘，
    背包伴我走天涯。
    一个背包一座山，
    狂风恶雨摧不垮，
    战士就是背山人，
    艰难奇险踩脚下。
    一个背包一团火，
    恰似支支红火把，
    仇恨是它导火线，
    化作世界漫天霞！
