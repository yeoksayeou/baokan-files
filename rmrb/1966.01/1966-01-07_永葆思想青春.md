    Forever Retain the Youth of Thought
    The increase in a person's age with the passage of time is a natural phenomenon. There is no necessary causal relationship between a person's age and their thoughts. If one must say there is, then, for a revolutionary, the longer they engage in revolution, the deeper their feelings for the revolutionary cause and the more steadfast their revolutionary will. After examining their own thoughts, the comrades of the Shahe County Party Committee said that when the word "I" increases in the mind, the word "old" takes the opportunity to enter, and various distracting thoughts arise from this. Negative emotions such as "seeking no merit, but seeking no fault" all follow. Indeed, once a revolutionary relaxes ideological struggle, separates from the revolutionary people, and highlights the individual, such people together easily spread this or that kind of argument that wears down revolutionary will, and will unconsciously promote the emotional corrosive of the decadent class to their comrades.
    The comrades of the Shahe County Party Committee want to make revolution. They repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works with this "old" character in mind, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and re-enter the class struggle, gradually reversing the influence brought about by the "old" character, and their work begins to change. This is the consciousness of revolutionaries.
    Proletarian fighters are materialists. Natural laws cannot be violated. People's thoughts can be changed. If the word "revolution" is always in one's mind, one will live younger and younger. "Life is easily old, but Heaven is hard to age," the revolutionary struggle is endless, and true revolutionaries forever retain the youth of thought.

    永葆思想青春
    人的年龄随着时光的流逝而增长，是一种自然的现象。人的年龄同人的思想之间，并没有什么必然的因果联系。如果一定说有的话，那么，对于一个革命者来说，干革命的时间越长，对革命事业的感情就越深，革命意志就越坚定。沙河县委的同志检查了自己的思想后说，头脑中“我”字多了的时候，“老”字就乘隙而入，各种杂念也由此而生。什么“不求有功，但求无过”之类的消极情绪都随着出来了。的确，革命者只要一旦放松了思想斗争，脱离了革命人民，而把个人突出出来，这样的人在一起，就容易互相传播这样那样的消磨革命意志的论调，就会不自觉地向自己的同志推销没落阶级的感情腐蚀剂。
    沙河县委的同志是要革命的，他们带上这个“老”字反复学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，并且重新投入阶级斗争之中，逐步扭转“老”字所带来的影响，工作开始有了变化。这是革命者的自觉。
    无产阶级战士是唯物主义者。自然规律不能违背。人的思想可以改变。心目中随时有“革命”二字，人就会越活越年轻。“人生易老天难老”，革命的斗争是永不停息的，真正的革命者永葆思想的青春。
