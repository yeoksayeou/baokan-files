    Has Comrade Wu Han Firmly Established His Political Stance?
    Li Wen
    In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han stated that "for over twenty years, under the education, cultivation, and care of the Party, my class stance has been firmly established politically," but "in terms of...academic and ideological class stance, it is still fundamentally old, outdated, bourgeois, and even contains feudal elements." This is sophistry. Of course, there is a distinction between political issues and academic issues, and not all academic issues are political issues. However, the two are also extremely closely related.
    On this point, I agree with the opinions in Comrade Fang Qiu's article, that is, some people, although they also mistakenly glorified feudal ruling class figures, did not do so to attack socialism. This should be considered an academic issue, not a political issue. But as for "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," this play is not only anti-Marxist academically, but also anti-socialist politically. As Comrade Si Tong said, it uses a Hai Rui who was dismissed from office to express sympathy, regret, and support for right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office. Is this merely an academic error? Therefore, the fundamental error of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is political, which shows that Comrade Wu Han has not firmly established a proletarian stance politically.

    吴晗同志的政治立场站稳了吗？
    黎文
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中说，他“二十多年来一直在党的教育、培养、关怀下，政治上阶级立场是站稳了的”，“但在……学术思想上的阶级立场，却还基本上是旧的、老的、资产阶级的，以至还有封建的东西”。这是一种狡辩。当然，政治问题同学术问题是有所区别的，不是一切学术问题都是政治问题。但是，二者又有极其密切的联系。
    关于这一点，我同意方求同志文章中的意见，即有一些人虽然也错误地美化了封建统治阶级人物，但是他们并不是为了攻击社会主义，这应该说是学术性问题，而不是政治性问题。但是就《海瑞罢官》来说，这出戏不但在学术上是反马克思主义的，而且在政治上是反社会主义的。正如思彤同志所说，它通过一个被罢了官的海瑞，来对被罢官的右倾机会主义者表示同情、婉惜和支持，难道这也只是学术错误吗？所以，《海瑞罢官》的根本错误是政治性的，这表明吴晗同志在政治上没有站稳无产阶级立场。
