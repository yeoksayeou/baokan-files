    Another Self-Exposure
    Just as the Johnson administration is stepping up its efforts to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet government is engaging in new collusion with US imperialism.
    The seventeen-nation disarmament conference reconvened in Geneva on January 27. Johnson presented a "seven-point plan" to the conference, advocating an agreement on the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation." The Soviet government representative, Tsarapkin, openly told reporters that "prevention of nuclear proliferation" was a "ripe" issue that could "reach an agreement," and that the Soviet Union was "ready to sign a non-proliferation agreement as soon as possible."
    The US government said that because member states had "differences" on the Vietnam issue, "it gives us even more important reasons to seek our common interests in preventing nuclear proliferation and curbing the arms race." The Soviet government representative also said, "I do not want to make our discussions dependent on Vietnam."
    The US and the Soviet Union are singing in harmony, how harmonious, how intimate!
    Currently, US imperialism is increasing its military budget, increasing the number of draftees, expanding its armaments, and drawing forces from Western Europe and the Atlantic to Asia and the Pacific, further "escalating" the war of aggression against Vietnam, expanding it to the entire Indochina and even China. The Johnson administration's idea is clearly that when it is preparing to fight a major war in Vietnam, in Asia, there are "more important reasons" to seek "common interests" with the Soviet leaders.
    It seems that the Soviet leaders' eagerness to seek "common interests" with US imperialism is at least no less than that of Johnson. The leaders of a country claiming to be the most powerful socialist country can actually disregard the serious aggression against another socialist country, and actually declare that they can set aside the Vietnam issue and pursue an agreement with US imperialism. This is shocking, but it is a fact. This fully exposes the extent to which the Soviet leaders have degenerated in their pursuit of US-Soviet cooperation.
    The Soviet government representative's speech in Geneva is another self-exposure, indicating that some of the beautiful words previously spoken by the Soviet leaders are worthless. People remember that the Soviet government once issued a statement saying that the United States cannot intend to improve US-Soviet relations while simultaneously carrying out armed attacks on Vietnam. Now, the Soviet government representative in Geneva says that it is possible to set aside the Vietnam issue and reach an agreement with the United States on so-called "measures to promote the relaxation of international tensions." Isn't such a blatant betrayal?
    This is by no means due to the Soviet leaders' forgetfulness, but because they say one thing and do another. When they actually do it, they can't care about the beautiful words they themselves have said.
    The great Vietnamese people's current struggle against US aggression and for national salvation is the focus of the struggle of people all over the world against US imperialism. How to treat the Vietnam issue is the touchstone for testing whether one is truly anti-American or falsely anti-American, whether one wants true peace or false peace. It is inconceivable that one can talk about "easing international tensions" at a time when US imperialism is further expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and intensifying the massacre of the Vietnamese people. What Johnson is pursuing at the Geneva Disarmament Conference is nothing more than to paralyze the people of all countries and cover up the United States' criminal attempt to expand its war of aggression. The Soviet leaders' eagerness to reach an agreement with the United States on so-called "common interests" is actually helping US imperialism deceive the people of all countries, condoning US imperialism to expand the war, and massacre the Vietnamese people.
    Aren't the Soviet leaders shouting "united action" every day? Please see who they are taking united action with! They can be frankly told that as long as they take united action with US imperialism, Marxists-Leninists and the revolutionary people of the world will not be able to take united action with them.

### 又一次自我揭露

    又一次自我揭露
    正当约翰逊政府正在加紧扩大侵略越南战争的时候，苏联政府却同美帝国主义进行新的勾搭。
    十七国裁军会议一月二十七日在日内瓦复会。约翰逊向会议提出一个“七点计划”，鼓吹就所谓“防止核扩散”问题达成协议。苏联政府的代表查拉普金公开对记者说什么“防止核扩散”是一个“已经成熟的”可能“达成协议”的问题，苏联“准备尽快签订一项不扩散的协定”。
    美国政府说，因为与会成员国在越南问题上有“分歧”，“使我们有更为重要的理由来谋求我们在防止核扩散和制止军备竞赛方面的共同利益”。苏联政府的代表也说，“我不希望使我们的讨论取决于越南”。
    美苏一唱一和，何其合拍，何其亲密！
    目前，美帝国主义正在增加军事预算，增加征兵数额，扩充军备，从西欧和大西洋抽调兵力到亚洲和太平洋，使侵略越南的战争进一步“升级”，扩大到整个印度支那以至中国。约翰逊政府的想法显然是，当它准备在越南、在亚洲大打的时候，有“更为重要的理由”同苏联领导人谋求“共同利益”。
    看来，苏联领导人同美帝国主义谋求“共同利益”的迫切心情，至少也不亚于约翰逊。一个号称最强大的社会主义国家的领导人，居然可以对另一个社会主义国家受到严重侵略置于不顾，居然宣布可以撇开越南问题不管，而追求同美帝国主义达成协议，这是骇人听闻的，但却是事实。这充分暴露了苏联领导人为了追求美苏合作已经堕落到何种地步。
    苏联政府代表在日内瓦的讲话，是又一次自我揭露，表明了苏联领导人过去说过的一些漂亮话，是一钱不值的。人们记得，苏联政府曾发表过声明说，美国不能一方面打算改善美苏关系，而同时却对越南进行武装袭击。现在，苏联政府的代表在日内瓦却说，可以撇开越南问题，同美国就所谓“促进缓和国际紧张局势的措施”达成协议。这样出尔反尔，不是赤裸裸地背叛又是什么呢？
    这决不是由于苏联领导人的健忘，而是由于他们说的是一套，做的又是一套。当他们真正做起来的时候，就顾不得他们自己说过的那些漂亮话了。
    目前伟大的越南人民正在进行的抗美救国斗争，是全世界各国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的焦点。怎样对待越南问题，是考验真反美还是假反美、要真和平还是要假和平的试金石。不能设想，在美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略越南战争、加紧屠杀越南人民的时候，能够谈到什么“缓和国际紧张局势”。约翰逊在日内瓦裁军会议上所追求的，不过是要麻痹各国人民，掩盖美国扩大侵略战争的罪恶图谋。苏联领导人急于同美国就所谓“共同利益”达成协议，实际上就是帮助美帝国主义欺骗各国人民，纵容美帝国主义扩大战争，屠杀越南人民。
    苏联领导人不是天天叫喊“联合行动”吗？请看他们是在同谁联合行动呵！可以坦率地告诉他们，只要他们一天同美帝国主义联合行动，马克思列宁主义者和世界革命人民就一天不能同他们联合行动。
