    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 27th – Reports from Saigon: The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has continuously attacked heavily defended enemy areas such as Da Nang and Qui Nhon in the past two days, inflicting casualties and losses on the enemy.
    According to Western news agencies, following the intense artillery bombardment of the Da Nang base of the US aggressor troops in the early morning of the 25th, the Liberation Army again shelled the US air force base in Da Nang in the early morning of the 27th. Reports say that the shells landed in the area of the US Naval Construction Battalion No. 9. On the 25th and 26th, the Liberation Army also repeatedly attacked patrols of the US Marine Corps operating near Da Nang. It is reported that the Liberation Army used automatic weapons and hand grenades to attack a US military patrol operating about 13 kilometers south of Da Nang. About six kilometers south of Da Nang, a patrol of the US Marine Corps suffered casualties after triggering a mine laid by the Liberation Army. In addition, US military patrols west and northwest of Da Nang also suffered casualties after triggering mines and booby traps laid by the Liberation Army.
    Eighty kilometers north of Qui Nhon, the Liberation Army fiercely ambushed the US 1st Cavalry Division on Highway 1 on the 26th, who were conducting a "sweep." During the ambush, nine US helicopters were hit. It is reported that this "sweep" was launched on the morning of the 25th by US aggressor troops, South Korean mercenary troops, and South Vietnamese puppet troops, who attempted to clear Highway 1, known as the "Highway of Death," through this "sweep" called "Operation Masher."
    On the night of the 25th, the Liberation Army of Guangyi Province occupied a puppet army stronghold near Shanjing County, and the Liberation Army of Di Shi Province shelled the puppet army in Weiqing City with mortars, inflicting casualties on the enemy.

    According to preliminary reports, during the attack, the Liberation Army completely annihilated one enemy company and one platoon, killing, wounding, and capturing 125 puppet soldiers; routing two puppet security platoons and one civil defense platoon, and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

    在归仁以北八十公里的地方，解放军二十六日在一号公路上猛烈伏击了正在进行“扫荡”的美国第一骑兵师。在伏击中，九架美国直升飞机被击中。据报道，这次“扫荡”是二十五日清晨由美国侵略军、南朝鲜帮凶军和南越伪军发动的，他们妄图通过这次名叫“捣碎机行动”的“扫荡”，打通被称为“死亡公路”的一号公路。
    二十五日夜间，广义省的解放军攻占了山晶县附近的一个伪军据点，迪石省的解放军用迫击炮轰击了渭清市的伪军，使敌人遭到了伤亡。
