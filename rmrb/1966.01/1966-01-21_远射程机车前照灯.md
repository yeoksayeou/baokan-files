    Long-Range Locomotive Headlight

    A new type of long-range locomotive headlight is being produced in batches at the Harbin Torch Light Factory. The effective illumination distance of this light is 600 meters, which is twice that of the locomotive headlights currently produced in China. This will better meet the needs of high-speed and safe railway operation in our country. This new product, designated the "Type 65 Universal Locomotive Headlight," not only has a long illumination range but also offers the advantages of convenient dimming, economic durability, and strong versatility. It can be applied to various types of steam locomotives, and with slight modifications to the lamp body, it can also be used in diesel and electric locomotives.

    远射程机车前照灯
    一种新的机车远射程前照灯正在哈尔滨炬光制灯厂成批生产。这种灯的有效光照距离为六百米，比目前我国生产的机车前照灯超出一倍。这样可以更加适应我国铁路高速安全行车的需要。这种定名为“六五型通用机车前照灯”的新产品，不仅光照远，而且具有调光方便、经济耐用、通用性强等优点。它能适用于各种型号的蒸汽机车，把灯体稍加改进，还能用于内燃机车和电气机车。
