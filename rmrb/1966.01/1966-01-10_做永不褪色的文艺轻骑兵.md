    Be a Literary and Art Light Cavalry That Never Fades
    Member of the Ulanmuqi Touring Performance Team of Inner Mongolia　Lā xī ào sī ěr (拉西敖斯尔)
    I am the son of a poor herdsman who suffered oppression and exploitation for generations under the herdowners. In the past, I had never even left my banner. I never imagined that today I would participate in the Ulanmuqi Touring Performance Team. In half a year, I have performed in various provinces in Central South, Southwest, and Northeast China. I visited many important industrial and mining enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Daqing, Changchun Automobile Manufacturing Company, and Luoyang Tractor Factory. I visited Comrade Mao Zedong's hometown of Shaoshan and Changsha First Normal School where he studied, as well as the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi. I have seen with my own eyes the beautiful landscape of the motherland that is worthy of endless praise and the great achievements of socialist construction, as well as the new face of people of all ethnic groups holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advancing by leaps and bounds.
    The first place we arrived at was Wuhan, by the Yangtze River. Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel are brothers, and we brought greetings from the workers of Baotou Steel to Wuhan Steel. We saw that the welcoming crowd had already formed a long line, and the veteran worker warmly said, "Our Ulanmuqi has arrived." What deep affection this is! At that time, it was the hot weather where people were sweating like rain. The workers saw that we were wearing ethnic costumes and performing in every workshop, and they considerately said, "It's enough to see you. It's too hot, perform one less show." They constantly stuffed us with soda and popsicles. The weather was very hot, but our hearts were even hotter. Seeing the steelworkers working under such high temperatures, with furnaces of molten iron flowing and sparks flying, producing more and better steel for the motherland, how could we be afraid of the heat and how could we rest!
    On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, we came to the southern gate of the motherland—Youyiguan (Friendship Pass). After performing for the soldiers guarding the pass and the Zhuang people in the nearby village, it was already one o'clock in the afternoon. When we heard that there were still some soldiers on duty on the nearby Jinji Mountain who had not seen the performance and requested to go up the mountain to perform for them, the leader of the troops refused, saying that it was too hot, the mountain was too high, and they had not eaten lunch, so it would be too tiring. How could we listen to that? Each of us took a musical instrument and ran up the mountain. This mountain was really high and steep, and because we had lived on the grasslands and had never climbed a mountain, it was especially difficult to climb. The midday sun was shining overhead, and although everyone was panting and sweating profusely, no one stopped on the way. Everyone said that as long as there are soldiers, we can go. The People's Liberation Army is not afraid of hardship or fatigue, carrying food and water from the foot of the mountain to the top every day. What is our little difficulty compared to that?
    We and the literary and art workers of nineteen ethnic groups in Yunnan went to Shilin, more than three hundred miles away from Kunming, for a joint celebration. Members of several communes and seven or eight villages within ten kilometers of the area also came. Everyone sang and danced one after another on the lawn in the middle of these beautiful bizarre peaks and rocks. We were extremely happy to see the beautiful songs and rich and colorful dances of the fraternal ethnic groups reflecting today's beautiful life and praising the Party and Chairman Mao. It was already twelve o'clock at night, and a slight chill was creeping in, but everyone was still reluctant to separate. Every place we go, we receive a very warm welcome and care. Along the way, there is truly endless friendship and endless feelings. 1965 is a year I will never forget, and it is also a year in which I received the most profound education.
    I think of being able to see our great leader Chairman Mao every year, every month, every day, and every night. I never imagined that this wish would really come true. On October 10th, Chairman Mao and other national leaders received us. This was the happiest moment of my life. When I think of how every step I have taken on the road to revolutionization has been nurtured by Chairman Mao's thought, and how Chairman Mao's works have given me strong perseverance when I have encountered difficulties, how can my heart not be excited!
    We will soon be returning. I will firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and serve the people wholeheartedly. When I return, I will properly publicize the great achievements of our motherland and the happy lives of all fraternal ethnic groups to the farmers and herdsmen. I will never forget the pastoral areas, never forget the grasslands, never forget labor, and I will dedicate my songs and dances to the farmers and herdsmen for the rest of my life, and be a literary and art light cavalry that never fades.

    做永不褪色的文艺轻骑兵
    内蒙古乌兰牧骑巡回演出队队员　拉西敖斯尔
    我是一个几代受牧主压迫剥削的贫苦牧民的儿子，过去连旗也没出过，没有想到今天参加乌兰牧骑巡回演出队，在半年的时间里，到了祖国中南、西南和东北的各省演出。参观了鞍钢、武钢、大庆、长春汽车制造公司、洛阳拖拉机厂等许多重要的工矿企业，访问了毛主席的故乡韶山冲，和他老人家读过书的长沙第一师范，以及革命历史名城遵义。我亲眼看到了祖国赞美不尽的锦绣河山和伟大的社会主义建设成就，以及各族人民高举毛泽东思想红旗突飞猛进的新面貌。
    我们到的第一个地方，是长江边上的武汉。包钢、武钢是兄弟，我们带着包钢工人的问候来到了武钢。只见欢迎的人群早已排成了长长的行列，工人老大哥热情地说：“我们的乌兰牧骑来了。”这是多么深的情意啊！那时正是挥汗如雨的热天，工人们看见我们穿着民族服装，每到一个车间都表演，都体贴地说：“看到你们就行了，天太热了，少演一个吧”。不断地把汽水、冰棍塞给我们吃。天气很热，我们的心更热，看到钢铁工人在那么高的气温下操作，一炉炉铁水奔流，钢花飞舞，为祖国生产更多更好的钢材，我们怎么能怕热、怎么能休息呢！
      “八一”建军节前夕，我们来到了祖国的南大门——友谊关。给守关的战士、附近村子的壮族人民演出以后，已经是下午一点了。听说附近金鸡山上还有一些战士值勤，没有看到演出，要求上山给他们表演时，部队负责人说什么也不肯，他们说天太热，山太高，又没有吃午饭，那样太疲倦了。我们哪里肯听，每个人拿了一件乐器，就往山上跑。这山真是又高又陡，加上我们在草原生活没有爬过山，爬起来特别吃力。正午的太阳当头照着，虽然每个人都气喘呼呼，身上汗如雨下，却没有人在途中停下脚步。大家说，只要有战士的地方，我们就能去。解放军不怕苦不怕累，每天从山下往山上背粮食，背水，我们这一点困难又算得了什么。
    我们和云南十九个民族的文艺工作者到离昆明三百多里地的石林联欢。当地十公里内的几个公社，七八个村子的社员，也都来了。大家在这美丽的奇峰异石中间的草坪上，唱了一个又一个，跳了一个又一个。我们看到兄弟民族反映今天美好的生活，歌颂党和毛主席的优美歌曲和丰富多采的舞蹈，真是高兴极了。已经夜里十二点了，凉意有些袭人了，大家还是不愿分离。我们每到一个地方，都受到非常热情的欢迎和关怀。一路上真是说不尽的友谊，说不完的感想，一九六五年是我永远忘不了的一年，也是我受到最深刻教育的一年。
    我年年月月，日日夜夜，都想念着能见到我们各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席。没有想到，这一愿望真的实现了，十月十日，毛主席和其他国家领导人接见了我们。这是我一生中最幸福的时刻。当我想起自己在革命化的道路上每前进一步，都受到主席思想的哺育，遇到了困难，主席著作给了坚强的毅力，我的心情怎么能不激动啊！
    我们很快就要回去了。我要牢牢地记住毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务。回去好好地向农牧民们宣传我们祖国的伟大成就，各兄弟民族的幸福生活。永远不忘牧区、不忘草原、不忘劳动，为农牧民献歌送舞一辈子，做个永不褪色的文艺轻骑兵。
