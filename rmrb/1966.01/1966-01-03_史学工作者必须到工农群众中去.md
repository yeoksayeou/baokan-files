    Historical Workers Must Go to the Workers and Peasants
    Shi Song
    Chairman Mao said: "We advocate that intellectuals go to the masses, to factories, and to rural areas. It would be very bad if they never met workers and peasants in their entire lives. Our state organ personnel, writers, artists, teachers, and scientific research personnel should use various opportunities to approach workers and peasants as much as possible"①.
    From December of last year to May of this year, I participated in the socialist education movement in the countryside. During these five months, I ate, lived, and labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and I also engaged in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation with them. Through this period of revolutionary practice, I further realized that Chairman Mao's above instructions are very correct and very brilliant. It made me further realize that going to the workers and peasants to participate in the three great revolutionary movements is the best way to reform intellectuals at present, and it is also the only way for philosophy and social science workers to achieve both redness and expertise. Below, I will talk about my shallow understanding.
          Correct the Class Stand, Cultivate Class Feelings
    I was born into a family of working people. Because I was separated from labor and working people for a long time, the image of working people gradually blurred in my mind.
    When I heard people say, "Poor and lower-middle peasants are backward, selfish, and dirty," and "College students are more conscious than poor and lower-middle peasants," I felt that these words made sense. After studying for a few years, I thought I was great and looked down on workers and peasants, and my feelings for workers and peasants became increasingly weak. Since I lacked deep feelings for workers and peasants, the idea of serving the people became increasingly weak, and bourgeois individualism began to rise.
    This time I went to the countryside, I ate, lived, and labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Although I also knew in principle that the poor and lower-middle peasants were the reliable force of the revolution and my teachers, I still looked down on them a little at the beginning and was incompatible with them. As the days of getting along grew longer, "time reveals a person's heart," and I gradually changed my opinion of them. That is to say, my ideological feelings underwent a fundamental change from looking down on poor and lower-middle peasants to respecting them and loving them.
    First of all, I deeply felt that the class stand of the poor and lower-middle peasants is very firm, and their class viewpoint is very clear. When I visited the poor and asked about their suffering, everyone burst into tears as soon as the suffering before liberation was mentioned, and even sobbed. They bitterly accused the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists of exploiting them through high rents, usury, and extra-economic coercion, forcing them to live a life worse than that of cattle and horses. They bitterly accused the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese devils of oppressing and bullying the people, forcing many poor and lower-middle peasants to lose their families and homes. They also told me with excitement how the Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued them from the sea of ​​misery, and how they guided them onto the broad road of cooperation and people's communes, so that their lives were improved day by day. They deeply understand what to love and what to hate. They have infinite loyalty and incomparable love for the Party and Chairman Mao, for socialism; and they hate class enemies very much. A landlord element in the production team slipped to her daughter's house. She lived a carefree parasitic life in her daughter's house. Although I knew about this, I just regarded it as a passing breeze. When the poor and lower-middle peasants saw that I ignored this matter, they suggested to me, "The landlord eats the grain from our team, but not only does she not work in the team, but she doesn't even pee in our team. She still lives the life of a landlord in the past. Why don't you bring her back and let us supervise her labor?" This question made my face red, and I had to lower my head in shame. The class viewpoint of the poor and lower-middle peasants is so clear, but where did the Marxist class viewpoint of me, who had read Marxist "books," go? Recalling myself in the past at school, I thought I was great after reading a little Marxist-Leninist books, but whenever there was any disturbance in society, I would be confused, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and unable to stand firm. This was not only the case when the rightists attacked the Party in 1957, but also when the black wind of "household contract system" was blowing a few years ago. Today, when I come to the countryside from school, my class viewpoint is far inferior to that of the poor and lower-middle peasants. As Chairman Mao said: "Some people have read some Marxist books and think they are knowledgeable, but they have not read them in, they have not taken root in their minds, they will not apply them, and their class feelings are still old. There are also some people who are very proud. They have read a few sentences and think they are great, and their tails are raised to the sky, but when they encounter storms, their positions are very different from those of workers and most working peasants. The former wavers, the latter is firm, the former is ambiguous, the latter is clear."② Aren't the poor and lower-middle peasants more conscious than me? How can you say they are backward?
    Through the "three togethers" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I also understand that because they suffered the deepest oppression and exploitation in the old society, they hate the old society the most, and they hate the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and the Kuomintang reactionaries who oppressed them the most. In the past years of revolutionary war, they did not hesitate to shed their heads and shed their blood, using all manpower and material resources to support the revolutionary war, and contributing great forces to the liberation of the motherland and the birth of the new China. In today's era of socialist revolution and construction, it is the poor and lower-middle peasants who persist in taking the socialist road in the countryside, rain or shine. This time I went to the countryside, I personally saw them actively rise up and wage a resolute struggle against the class enemies. A poor association representative in the production team said: "I am not afraid of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements. Even if I risk my life, I will fight them to the end." The poor and lower-middle peasants disregard face, boldly expose the crimes of class enemies, and strictly supervise the activities of class enemies. They do not complain about hardship, working during the day and often holding meetings until late at night. In order to defeat the attacks of capitalist and feudal forces, they do not hesitate to sacrifice everything, dare to fight, and dare to win. Indeed, it is they who, under the leadership of the Party, united the middle peasants, united the majority of cadres, defeated the rampant attacks of capitalist and feudal forces, and consolidated and expanded the socialist position in the countryside. I also personally saw the poor and lower-middle peasants getting up early and working late to farm for the revolution, and working selflessly to develop the collective economy, creating huge wealth. Today, the poor and lower-middle peasants are still the mainstay of the revolution in the countryside, and they are the force that our Party relies on. How can you say that the poor and lower-middle peasants are backward?
    Through the "three togethers" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I also deeply felt that they have many excellent qualities such as loving the collective, being selfless, and being diligent and simple. There are many examples of poor and lower-middle peasants loving the collective and being selfless. This year, during the Spring Festival, a cow in the production team gave birth to a calf. Due to congenital insufficiency, the calf was very weak and could not eat milk. The poor and lower-middle peasants visited the cowshed again and again as if their own baby was sick, and some even took the initiative to give their own food to the team's calf. Several poor and lower-middle peasants kept baking the calf with fire, while squatting next to the cow, squeezing the milk drop by drop and feeding it to the calf. This continued for several days. One of the poor association representatives did not leave the cowshed for five days and five nights, and did not get a good sleep. His eyes were red, and everyone advised him to rest, but he refused. His own child was sick, and his lover asked him to take the child to the hospital to see a doctor, but he said, "The team's cow is important," and still refused to go home. It was not until the sixth day that the calf could eat milk that he went home. Looking at this poor association representative who valued the team's calf more than his own child, I felt that his image was very tall, and he was simply like a giant standing tall. Thinking of myself, I would not be happy even if I was asked to sit in the bright and clean office for two more hours, let alone squat in the dirty and smelly cowshed for a few days and nights. In contrast, how small I am!
    As the saying goes, "The most beautiful flower is the peony, and the most beautiful person is thrifty." This time I went to the countryside, I also deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants, like the workers, are the most diligent and thrifty, and therefore the most beautiful. None of the poor and lower-middle peasants, regardless of gender, age, or age, is an idle person. There is an old poor peasant named Sun in the production team. He is almost seventy years old this year. His eldest son works in Shanghai and sends him money every month; the second and third sons work at home, and the family lives very well. He can completely not work and enjoy his old age at home. But he can't stay idle. As long as the team has work to do, he does everything. One day early in the morning, I met him picking up manure on the road, and I said to him, "Old man Sun, you are so old, why don't you rest at home?" He replied with a smile, "It's uncomfortable to stay at home and do nothing. It's quite pleasant to come out and move around." Indeed, for the poor and lower-middle peasants, labor has not only become a habit, but also a pleasure and the first need of life.
    The poor and lower-middle peasants treat production with "great liberation of thought, great enthusiasm, and great increase in measures", but they cherish consumption, even a grain of rice and a thread, and they never spend a penny indiscriminately. All they think about is production, and all they think about is contribution. Although they have been working for years and months and have created huge wealth for the country, their own lives are still relatively difficult. They have never thought about how much money the country should give them, how high a position and how much honor the country should give them. They never take the initiative to reach out to the country. However, I often calculate wages, positions, and reputations in my mind, and I am bound by fame and fortune, and even use the name of "serving the people" to practice individualism. As Chairman Mao said: "Comparing the unreformed intellectuals with the workers and peasants, you feel that the intellectuals are not clean. The cleanest are the workers and peasants. Although their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals."③ Now, I drink water with the poor and lower-middle peasants from the same bowl, sleep on the same bed, and cover the same quilt, and I don't feel dirty anymore. On the contrary, I feel that the poor and lower-middle peasants are much purer and more noble than me. I realize that the poor and lower-middle peasants are not only my parents who provide me with food and clothing, but also teachers worthy of my learning. I am determined to completely abandon the bad influence of the prejudice of the exploiting class, put down the stinky airs of intellectuals, and humbly learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. I am determined to despise bourgeois individualism and dedicate everything I have, even my entire life, to my parents who provide me with food and clothing, and to my respected teachers. I am willing to be a cow for the workers and peasants for the rest of my life, and serve the workers and peasants wholeheartedly for the rest of my life!
    Obviously, this change in ideological feelings will never happen if you just sit in your study. I feel that feelings for workers and peasants are something that an intellectual who has never been close to workers and peasants cannot talk about at all, just like "you can't talk about ice with a summer insect." Only by going deep into the workers and peasants, living, working, and fighting with them, can you truly understand the workers and peasants, and can you cultivate deep feelings for them. This is my first deeper understanding after going to the countryside.
            The Countryside is the Best Laboratory for Social Sciences
    The laboratory of social sciences is society. Is this really the case? I left my study and plunged into the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside with a skeptical attitude. After more than five months of social practice, I was convinced. Indeed, the countryside is the best laboratory for social sciences.
    Before going to the countryside, although I also knew that class analysis is the fundamental method of studying history, because I had not participated in the practice of class struggle with the workers and peasants, these things did not take root in my mind, and when I encountered practical problems, I put "class analysis" behind me. For example, when Mr. Liu Jie was selling the "abstract inheritance method," he promoted the old saying "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you." He said that "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you" is "a heart that comes from caring for people," and it cannot be said that this principle "cannot be applied to class enemies at all." At that time, I also admired Mr. Liu Jie's "goods" a little. It was not until the historical circles criticized his fallacies that I realized that I had been fooled by him. After participating in the socialist education movement, I further realized that in the era of "officials are not subject to criminal punishment, and common people are not subject to etiquette", the saying "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you" was just a criterion prescribed by Confucius for the internal relations of the ruling class, and it was originally class-based; and today, in today when there are still classes and class struggle, we cannot inherit this old saying without criticism. This time I went to the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants told me with vivid facts that at present, although the class enemies look honest on the surface, they have not completely given up in reality. They are always dreaming of capitalist restoration, they are always dreaming of taking back their lost "heaven", and they are always looking for opportunities to retaliate against our cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1962, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang conspired to invade the mainland, even individual landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were overwhelmed and openly clamored to kill our cadres. When fighting against the class enemies, the poor and lower-middle peasants were filled with indignation and anger. This anger burned away the mask on the class enemies and illuminated my eyes, making me further recognize the ugly nature of the class enemies and further realize that the jackal nature of the class enemies has not changed at present. If we do not exercise dictatorship over them, they will exercise dictatorship over us. Therefore, "We will never practice benevolence towards the reactionary acts of the reactionaries and the reactionary classes"④. Kindness to the enemy is cruelty to the people. We can only exercise dictatorship over class enemies, and we cannot talk about "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you" without principle.
    It can also be seen from this that in a class society, "all thoughts are branded with the mark of the class"⑤. So-called supra-class thoughts, which can represent the thoughts of two opposing classes, do not exist at all. Regarding the red flag of the people's commune, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants said "very good", while a small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists said it was "very bad", it is really "what kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of class says what kind of words". Because of different class positions, their thoughts, views, and words and deeds are completely different. The issue of class position is a fundamental issue, and there can be no ambiguity at all. Recalling the eve of going to the countryside, when discussing the issue of Li Xiucheng, the "merit and demerit theory" believers believed that although Li Xiucheng surrendered to the enemy in prison and wrote a confession, his "merit before being captured was very great" and he "deserved to be a hero", so the traitor and hero could not be "combined into one" and imposed on Li Xiucheng alone. At that time, I felt that the "merit and demerit theory" also made a little sense. Thinking about it now, how absurd and naive this is! Through more than five months of revolutionary practice, I deeply realized that in historical research, "we must firmly grasp the fact of social class division, the fact of the change of class rule forms, and take it as the basic guideline, and use this viewpoint to analyze all social problems"⑥. It is a pity that there are still people who say: "The current great debate in the philosophical, literary, and historical circles is not a class struggle." This is extremely absurd.
    Before going to the countryside, although I also knew that the people are the creators of history and the real heroes, this was only knowledge gained from books. I had not participated in the revolutionary practice of the workers and peasants, so I did not understand it deeply, let alone apply it well. When studying ancient Chinese history, I always thought that Zhuge Liang was the real hero, and the vast number of soldiers was just an insignificant group of "Adou". In daily life, I also often overestimated myself and underestimated the masses, and looked down on the workers and peasants a little. This time when I went to the countryside, I thought that the peasants were ideologically backward and not open-minded, so I had many worries. I was afraid that the masses could not be mobilized and that the capitalist and feudal forces could not be defeated. Later practice proved that I was wrong. In the practice of class struggle, as long as we conscientiously act in accordance with the Party's policies and hand over the Party's policies to the masses, the peasants, especially the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants, can quickly understand and master the Party's policies. Once the poor and lower-middle peasants master the Party's policies, their revolutionary enthusiasm and political enthusiasm are greatly improved, and they rise up to wage a resolute struggle against the capitalist and feudal forces. Once the broad masses are mobilized and a wide-ranging mass movement is formed, its momentum is like a storm, invincible and unconquerable.
    In the days of "three togethers" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I also deeply realized that the vast number of peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, are not only heroes in the class struggle, but also heroes in the production struggle. At first, I thought that although I could not be considered an agronomist, I had learned some agronomy and biology, and I could always deal with simple agricultural production. So when I first entered the village, I liked to point fingers and command others, but I was unwilling to humbly learn from the peasants, which often made me run into walls. I remember one time when several poor and lower-middle peasants came to me to discuss how to win a bumper autumn harvest. They said: "The growth of crops depends entirely on fertilizer." I said: "Yes, fertilizer is very important. You must try your best to develop fertilizer sources and accumulate more fertilizer." Then they humbly asked me how to develop fertilizer sources. I thought for a long time, but I could not answer a word. Later, it was the poor and lower-middle peasants who had a solution. After discussing it, they decided to engage in "grass pond mud" on a large scale. They used some small depressions on the riverside, roadside, and field edge to dig small ponds, put chopped rice straw and bean stalks into the ponds, sandwiched several layers of rotten mud and manure in the middle, covered them with soil, and watered them. After a period of fermentation, they would produce ponds of cheap and good-quality fertilizer. It was really more, faster, better, and more economical! A production team always had at least thousands of loads of grass pond mud, which basically solved the problem of insufficient fertilizer.
    All these facts have profoundly educated me and made me truly understand that "the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous"⑦.
      "Class struggle is the driving force of historical development." This sentence has almost become a commonplace for historical workers. However, in the past, I lacked specific feelings for this sentence and did not understand it deeply. This time I went to the countryside, I personally saw the vast number of commune members, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, actively rise up to fight against the capitalist and feudal forces. Through this class struggle, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions within the people were exposed, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, these contradictions were properly resolved. In this way, not only were the various systems of labor management, work point quota, distribution, finance, and warehouse management improved, and the various systems of the people's commune were more sound and perfect, but more importantly, the class enemies were more isolated, the relationship between cadres and the masses was closer, and the ideological consciousness and production enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses were greatly improved, so that the entire commune achieved a special bumper summer harvest - the total output and yield per unit area of ​​the three wheat crops broke the highest historical records. With such personal feelings, now I can say that I have a more concrete and deeper understanding of the truth that "class struggle is the driving force of historical development" than before I went to the countryside.
    Through the above facts, I deeply realize that practice, only practice, is the basis and source of cognitive development. "To learn Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can we truly learn it."⑧
                      ×　×　×
    More than five months of revolutionary practice made me realize that reading Marxist classics and reading Chairman Mao's books, although it is an important way to transform intellectuals, it is not enough to just sit in the study and read behind closed doors. We must closely combine reading and practice. At present, only by going deep into the workers and peasants to participate in the three great revolutionary movements can intellectuals truly understand the workers and peasants, cultivate deep feelings for the workers and peasants, and serve the workers and peasants well. That is to say, can they transform their old world outlook. At the same time, only by going deep into the workers and peasants to participate in the three great revolutionary movements can we connect theory with practice, turn the things in books into our own things, and truly learn Marxism. Therefore, for intellectuals, especially for philosophy and social science workers, going deep into the workers and peasants to participate in the three great revolutionary movements is not only the best way to transform their thinking, but also the only way to achieve both redness and expertise.

    Editor's Note
    Promoting proletarian ideology and destroying bourgeois ideology is a long-term and arduous task for intellectuals, and it is a process of thoroughly transforming the world outlook. This requires intellectuals to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought cannot be learned only from books. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "To learn Marxism-Leninism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can we truly learn it." These two articles published today were written by two young comrades from Nanjing University after participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside, which once again proves this with vivid examples.
    We can see from these two articles that only by throwing themselves into the three great revolutionary movements can intellectuals gradually change their class stand and class feelings, and gradually establish a proletarian world outlook. As Comrade Shi Song said, "If you just sit in your study, this change in ideological feelings will never happen"; feelings for workers and peasants are something that "you can't talk about ice with a summer insect." Only by going deep into the workers and peasants, living, working, and fighting with them, can you truly understand the workers and peasants, and can you cultivate deep feelings for them." Going deep into reality and going deep into the masses can also combine theory and practice and learn the correct method of conducting investigation and research. The number of materialistic dialectics in the mind increases, and the number of idealism and metaphysics decreases. Comrade Liu Linyuan's experience in this regard is enlightening to everyone.

### 史学工作者必须到工农群众中去

    史学工作者必须到工农群众中去
    石松
    毛主席说：“我们提倡知识分子到群众中去，到工厂去，到农村去。如果一辈子都不同工人农民见面，这就很不好。我们的国家机关工作人员、文学家、艺术家、教员和科学研究人员，都应该尽可能地利用各种机会去接近工人农民”①。
    从去年十二月到今年五月，我参加了农村社会主义教育运动。在这五个多月中，我与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，并和他们一起从事阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验等三大革命运动。通过这一段革命实践，我进一步体会到毛主席的上述指示是十分正确、十分英明的。使我进一步体会到，到工农中去参加三大革命运动，是当前改造知识分子的最好途径，也是哲学社会科学工作者达到又红又专的必由之路。下面就来谈一谈我的一点粗浅的体会。
          端正阶级立场，培养阶级感情
    我出身于劳动人民的家庭，由于长期脱离劳动，脱离劳动人民，因而劳动人民的形象在脑子里逐渐模糊起来。
    听到有人说：“贫下中农落后、自私、肮脏”，“大学生的觉悟比贫下中农高”，我觉得这些话也有道理。读了几年书，就觉得自己了不起，看不起工农，工农感情日益淡薄起来。既然缺乏深厚的工农感情，为人民服务的思想也就日益淡薄，而资产阶级个人主义思想却日渐抬头了。
    这次下乡，我与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动。虽然从道理上我也知道贫下中农是革命的依靠力量，是我的老师，但是在开始时，我还有点看不起他们，和他们格格不入。及至相处的日子久了，“日久见人心”，我才逐渐改变了对他们的看法。就是说，从看不起贫下中农到尊敬贫下中农，热爱贫下中农，思想感情起了根本性的变化。
    首先，我深切地感到贫下中农的阶级立场十分坚定，阶级观点十分鲜明。我在访贫问苦的时候，一提到解放前的苦，个个都是未语泪先流，甚至泣不成声。他们悲愤地控诉了地富反坏分子在解放前怎样用高额地租、高利贷和超经济的强制手段，敲骨吸髓，迫使他们过着牛马不如的生活。他们悲愤地控诉了国民党反动派和日本鬼子怎样鱼肉人民、欺压百姓，逼得许多贫下中农倾家荡产，家破人亡。他们又以激动的心情告诉我，共产党和毛主席怎样把他们救出苦海，又怎样指引他们走上合作化、人民公社的康庄大道，使生活一天天得到改善。他们深深懂得应该爱什么、恨什么。他们对党和毛主席，对社会主义具有无限的忠诚和无比的热爱；而他们对阶级敌人是万分地痛恨的。生产队里有个地主分子溜到女儿家里去了。她在女儿家消遥自在，过着寄生虫的生活。我虽然知道有这回事，但是只把它当作耳边风，吹过去了。贫下中农见我不理会这件事，就向我提意见说：“地主吃我们队里的粮，可是她不但不在队里劳动，而且连尿也不撒在我们队里，她依旧过着过去地主的生活，为什么不把她弄回来，让我们监督她劳动？”这一责问，真使我脸红耳赤，只好惭愧地低下了头。贫下中农的阶级观点是这样鲜明，而我这个读过马克思主义“本本”的人，马克思主义的阶级观点到哪里去了呢？回想起自己过去在学校里，读了一点马列主义的书，就以为很了不起了，但是社会上一有风吹草动，自己就会懵头转向，分不清是非，站不稳脚跟了。不仅一九五七年右派分子向党进攻的时候是如此，就是前几年刮“包产到户”的黑风时也是如此。今天走出校门到农村来，我的阶级观点又远不如贫下中农。这正如毛主席所说的那样：“有些人读了一些马克思主义的书，自以为有学问了，但是并没有读进去，并没有在头脑里生根，不会应用，阶级感情还是旧的。还有一些人很骄傲，读了几句书，自以为了不起，尾巴翘到天上去了，可是一遇风浪，他们的立场，比起工人和大多数劳动农民来，就显得大不相同。前者动摇，后者坚定，前者暧昧，后者明朗。”②难道贫下中农不是比自己更有觉悟吗？怎么能说他们落后呢？
    通过与贫下中农的“三同”，我也懂得：正因为他们在旧社会受的压迫和剥削最深，所以他们最痛恨旧社会，最痛恨压迫他们的地富反坏分子和国民党反动派。在过去革命战争的年代里，他们不惜抛头颅、洒热血，用一切人力物力支援了革命战争，为祖国的解放，为新中国的诞生，贡献了巨大的力量。在今天社会主义革命和建设的年代里，也正是贫下中农在农村中风里雨里，坚持走社会主义的道路。这次下乡，我亲眼看到了他们积极地起来跟阶级敌人进行坚决的斗争。生产队的一个贫协代表说：“我不怕地富反坏分子，就是豁出我的命，也要跟他们斗到底。”贫下中农不顾情面，大胆揭发阶级敌人的罪恶，严格监督阶级敌人的活动。他们不辞辛苦，白天劳动，晚上还常常开会到深夜。为了击退资本主义和封建主义势力的进攻，他们不惜牺牲一切，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。的确，正是他们，在党的领导下团结了中农，团结了干部的大多数，击溃了资本主义和封建主义势力的猖狂进攻，巩固和扩大了农村的社会主义阵地。我也亲眼看到贫下中农为革命而起早摸黑地种田，为发展集体经济而忘我地劳动，创造出巨大的财富。今天，贫下中农在农村中仍然是革命的中流砥柱，是我们党的依靠力量。怎么能说贫下中农落后呢？
    通过与贫下中农的“三同”，我还深切地感到，在他们身上有着热爱集体、公而忘私和勤劳朴素等许多优秀的品质。关于贫下中农热爱集体、公而忘私的事例是很多的。今年春节，生产队里的一条母牛生了一头牛犊，由于先天不足，牛犊十分虚弱，不会吃奶。贫下中农象自己的婴儿得了病似的，三番五次地跑到牛棚里去看望，有的还主动地把自己家里的粮食让出来，送给队里的小牛吃。几个贫下中农一边不停地用火烘牛犊，一边蹲在母牛的身边，把牛奶一滴一滴地挤下来，一口一口地喂给牛犊。这样连续护理了好几天。其中有一位贫协代表整整五天五夜没有离开过牛棚一步，没有睡过一个好觉。他的眼睛熬红了，大家劝他休息，他不肯。他自己的小孩病了，他爱人叫他把小孩送到医院去看看，他说“队里的牛要紧”，还是不肯回家。一直到第六天上，牛犊会吃奶了，他才回家。我看着这位把队里的小牛看得比自己的小孩还重的贫协代表，觉得他的形象非常高大，他简直象个顶天立地的巨人。联想到我自己，过去甭说叫我几天几夜蹲在又脏又臭的牛棚里，就是在窗明几净的办公室里值班，叫我多坐两个钟头，我也不高兴。相形之下，我是何等的渺小啊！
    俗话说：“花中最美是牡丹，人中最美是勤俭”。这次下乡，我还深切地感到，贫下中农和工人一样是最勤俭的，因而也是最美的。贫下中农不论男女老少，没有一个是闲人。生产队里有个姓孙的贫农老大爷，今年快七十岁了，他的大儿子在上海工作，每月都给他寄钱来；二儿、三儿在家劳动，一家生活十分富裕。他完全可以不劳动，在家颐养天年。可是他闲不住，只要队里有活计，他什么都干。有一天大清早，我碰见他在路上拾粪，我就对他说：“孙老爹，你这么大年纪了，不在家歇歇？”他笑呵呵地回答：“待在家里没事做，闲得怪难受的，出来动动倒是蛮惬意咯。”的确，对贫下中农来说，劳动不但已成为习惯，而且已成为一种愉快，已成为生活的第一需要了。
    贫下中农对待生产是“思想大解放，干劲大鼓足，措施大加码”，可是对待消费，那怕是一粒米、一根线都十分珍惜，他们从不乱花一分钱。他们脑子里所想的，除了生产还是生产，除了贡献还是贡献。虽然他们成年累月地劳动，已为国家创造了巨大的财富，但他们自己的生活也还比较艰苦，他们从来不曾想过国家应该给他们多少钱，应该给他们多高的地位和多大的名誉。他们也从来不主动地向国家伸手。可是，我脑子里却经常盘算着工资、地位和名誉，被名缰利锁所束缚，甚至借“为人民服务”之名，行个人主义之实。这真如毛主席所说的那样：“拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”③现在，我和贫下中农用同一个碗喝水，在一张床睡觉，盖同一条被子，也不觉得脏了。相反地，倒觉得贫下中农要比我纯洁得多，高尚得多。我体会到贫下中农不仅是我的衣食父母，而且也是值得我学习的老师。我决心彻底抛弃剥削阶级偏见的恶劣影响，放下知识分子的臭架子，虚心向工人、向贫下中农学习。我决心鄙弃资产阶级个人主义，把我的一切乃至整个生命，都献给我的衣食父母，献给我敬爱的老师。我甘愿做一辈子工农的牛，全心全意为工农服务一辈子！
    显然，光坐在书斋里，思想感情的这一变化是永远不会发生的。我觉得，工农感情对一个没有接近过工农的知识分子来说，好比“夏虫不可与语冰”，是根本谈不上的。只有深入到工农中去，跟工农同生活、同劳动、同战斗，才能真正了解工农，才能培养起深厚的工农感情。这是我下乡后第一个较深的体会。
            农村是社会科学最好的实验室
    社会科学的实验室是社会。事实真的是这样吗？我抱着一种将信将疑的态度，走出书斋，投入了农村的三大革命运动。通过五个多月的社会实践，我信服了。的确，农村是社会科学最好的实验室。
    下乡以前，虽然我也知道，阶级分析是研究历史的根本方法，但是由于自己没有到工农中去参加过阶级斗争的实践，所以这些东西没有在头脑里生根，一碰到实际问题，就把“阶级分析”置诸脑后了。例如，刘节先生在贩卖“抽象继承法”的时候，捧出了“己所不欲，勿施于人”这句古话。他说：“己所不欲，勿施于人”是“本心出于爱护人”，不能说这个原则根本“不能适用于阶级敌人”。当时，对刘节先生的这号“货色”，我也有点欣赏。直到史学界对他的谬论进行批判，我才知道自己是上了他的当。参加社会主义教育运动以后，我更进一步体会到，“己所不欲，勿施于人”这句话，在“刑不上大夫，礼不下庶人”的时代，只不过是孔子为统治阶级内部的相互关系而规定的一个准则，本来就是有阶级性的；而在今天，在仍然存在阶级和阶级斗争的今天，我们更不能不加批判地继承这句古话。这次下乡，贫下中农以活生生的事实告诉我：目前，尽管表面上看去阶级敌人都很老实，但是实际上他们并没有完全死心。他们时刻都在梦想资本主义复辟，他们时刻都在梦想夺回他们已失去的“天堂”，他们时刻都在寻找机会对我们的干部和贫下中农进行报复。一九六二年，蒋介石匪帮阴谋窜犯大陆的时候，甚至有个别地富反坏分子得意忘形，公开叫嚣要杀害我们的干部。在对阶级敌人进行斗争的时候，贫下中农个个义愤填膺，怒火千丈。这怒火烧掉了披在阶级敌人身上的画皮，也照亮了我的眼睛，使我进一步认清了阶级敌人的丑恶本质，使我进一步认识到目前阶级敌人的豺狼本性并没有改变。我们不对他们实行专政，他们就要对我们实行专政。所以，“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政”④。对敌人的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍。对阶级敌人，我们只能实行专政，而不能无原则地讲“己所不欲，勿施于人”。
    从这里也可看出，在阶级社会中，“各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”⑤。所谓超阶级的思想，能够代表两个对立阶级的思想，是根本不存在的。对人民公社这面红旗，广大的贫下中农说“好得很”，而一小撮地富反坏分子却说它“糟得很”，真是“什么树开什么花，什么阶级说什么话”。由于阶级立场不同，他们的思想、观点和言行也就截然不同。阶级立场问题，是一个根本问题，丝毫不能含糊。回想起在下乡的前夕，讨论李秀成问题的时候，“功过论”者认为李秀成虽然在狱中投降了敌人，写了自白书，但是他在被俘前的“功劳是很大的”，还“不愧是一个英雄”，因而不能把叛徒和英雄“合二而一”，硬加在李秀成一个人身上。那时，我觉得“功过论”也有点道理。现在想起来，这是多么的荒谬，多么的幼稚啊！通过五个多月的革命实践，我深深体会到，在历史研究中，“就必须牢牢把握住社会阶级划分的事实，阶级统治形式改变的事实，把它作为基本的指导线索，并用这个观点去分析一切社会问题”⑥。遗憾的是，现在竟还有人说：“当前哲学界、文艺界和史学界的大论战不是阶级斗争”。这实在是荒谬到极点。
    下乡以前，虽然我也知道人民群众是历史的创造者，是真正的英雄，但是，这仅是从书本上得来的知识，自己还没有参加过工农群众的革命实践，所以领会不深，更不会很好地应用。在学习中国古代史的时候，我总认为诸葛亮才是真正的英雄，至于广大的士兵，只不过是微不足道的一群“阿斗”。在日常生活中，我也往往把自己估计得过高，而把群众估计得过低，有点看不起工农群众。这次下乡，刚进村时，我还以为农民群众思想落后，脑筋不开窍，所以顾虑重重，怕群众发动不起来，怕打不垮资本主义和封建主义势力。后来实践证明，我错了。在阶级斗争的实践中，只要认真地按党的政策办事，把党的政策交给群众，农民群众、尤其是广大的贫下中农，很快就能领会并掌握党的政策。贫下中农一旦掌握了党的政策，他们的革命热情和政治积极性就大为提高，他们纷纷起来同资本主义和封建主义势力作坚决的斗争。而广大的群众一经发动起来，广泛的群众运动一经形成，其势真如暴风骤雨，无坚不摧，无敌不克。
    在与贫下中农“三同”的日子里，我还深切地体会到，广大农民群众、特别是贫下中农，不但是阶级斗争中的英雄，而且也是生产斗争中的英雄。起初，我以为自己虽然算不上农学家，但多少学过一些农学、生物学，简单的农业生产总是对付得了的。所以刚入村时，我喜欢指手划脚地指挥别人，而不肯虚心向农民学习，结果使我常常碰壁。记得有一回，几个贫下中农跑来跟我商量如何夺取秋熟丰收的问题。他们说：“庄稼一枝花，全靠肥当家。”我说：“对，肥料很重要，你们要尽力开辟肥源，多积肥。”于是他们又谦虚地问我怎样来开辟肥源，我思索了半天，却答不出一句话来。后来，还是贫下中农有办法，他们商量了一下，决定大搞“草塘泥”。他们利用河边、路边、田边的一些小洼田，挖成了一个个小塘，把切碎的稻草和豆秸等放入塘内，中间夹几层烂泥和粪便，上面用泥土覆盖，浇上水，经过一定时期的发酵，就沤出一塘塘价廉物美的肥料来了。真是多快好省！一个生产队起码总有上千担的草塘泥，基本上解决了肥料不足的问题。
    以上这些事实，都深刻地教育了我，使我真正懂得了：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”⑦。
      “阶级斗争是历史发展的动力”，这句话几乎已成为史学工作者的口头语。但是，过去我对这句话缺乏具体的感受，领会不深。这次下乡，我亲眼看到了广大社员、特别是贫下中农，积极起来跟资本主义和封建主义势力进行斗争。通过这一场阶级斗争，揭露了敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾，并且在毛泽东思想的指导下，使这些矛盾得到了妥善的解决。这样，不仅劳动管理、工分定额、分配、财务和仓库保管等各项制度得到了改进，人民公社的各项制度更加健全、更加完善了，而且更重要的是，阶级敌人更孤立了，干群的关系更密切了，干群的思想觉悟和生产积极性大大提高了，从而使全公社都取得了夏熟的特大丰收，——三麦的总产和单产都打破了历史上的最高纪录。有了这样一些亲身的感受，现在可以说，我对“阶级斗争是历史发展的动力”这一真理，比下乡以前有了更具体更深刻的领会了。
    通过上面一些事实，我深深体会到：实践，只有实践，才是认识发展的基础和源泉。“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”⑧

    五个多月的革命实践使我体会到，读马克思主义经典著作，读毛主席的书，虽然是改造知识分子的一条重要途径，但是，光坐在书斋里闭门读书，还是不行的，必须把读书和实践紧密地结合起来。就当前来说，知识分子只有深入到工农群众中去参加三大革命运动，才能真正了解工农，才能培养起深厚的工农感情，才能很好地为工农服务，也就是说，才能使自己旧的世界观得到改造。同时，也只有深入到工农群众中去参加三大革命运动，才能把理论和实际联系起来，才能把书本上的东西变成自己的东西，才能真正学到马克思主义。所以对知识分子来说，尤其是对哲学社会科学工作者来说，深入到工农群众中去参加三大革命运动，不仅是思想改造的最好途径，而且也是达到又红又专的必由之路。

    编后
    兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，对于知识分子来说，是一个长期的艰巨的任务，是一个彻底改造世界观的过程。这就要求知识分子认真地学习马克思主义、毛泽东思想。学习马克思主义、毛泽东思想，不能仅仅从书本上学习。毛泽东同志指出：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”今天登载的这两篇文章，是南京大学的两位青年同志参加农村社会主义教育运动后写的，以生动的事例再次证明了这一点。
    我们从这两篇文章中可以看到，知识分子只有投身到三大革命运动中去，才能使自己的阶级立场和阶级感情逐步地发生变化，逐步地建立起无产阶级的世界观。正如石松同志所说，知识分子“光坐在书斋里，思想感情的这一变化是永远不会发生的”；工农感情对他们来说，“好比‘夏虫不可与语冰’，是根本谈不上的。只有深入到工农中去，跟工农同生活、同劳动、同战斗，才能真正了解工农，才能培养起深厚的工农感情”。深入实际，深入群众，还能够使理论和实践相结合，学会正确地进行调查研究的方法。头脑中的唯物辩证法增多了，唯心主义和形而上学减少了。刘林元同志在这一方面的体会，对大家是有启发的。
