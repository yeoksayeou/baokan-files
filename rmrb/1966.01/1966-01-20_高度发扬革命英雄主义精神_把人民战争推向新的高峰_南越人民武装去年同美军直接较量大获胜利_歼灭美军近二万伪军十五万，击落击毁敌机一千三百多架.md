    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th. According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces issued a communique on the battle achievements of the South Vietnamese military and civilians in 1965 on the 15th, stating that, according to incomplete statistics, the South Vietnamese military and civilians fought nearly 40,000 battles in 1965, annihilating a total of 167,500 enemies, including 19,200 US invading troops killed, wounded, and captured. During this year, 60,000 puppet troops deserted and went AWOL.

    The communique stated that in the past year, the Southern People's Armed Forces completely annihilated 52 enemy battalions, 227 companies, and 590 platoons (in 1964, only 8 enemy battalions, 71 companies, and 105 platoons were annihilated), including 9 US battalions and 12 companies. The number of puppet troops completely annihilated reached 43 battalions, which is equivalent to one-third of all puppet troops at the end of 1964. These completely annihilated puppet troops included four battalions belonging to the puppet army's strategic reserve force (accounting for one-third of the enemy's strategic reserve force at the end of 1964), thirteen battalions of the commando force (accounting for more than half of the total number of commando battalions at the end of 1964), four armored vehicle regiments, and twenty-two battalions belonging to the puppet army's main divisions and independent regiments.

    In 1965, the Southern military and civilians shot down and destroyed a total of 1,337 enemy aircraft (449 in 1964). They destroyed 1,960 enemy military vehicles of various types (721 in 1964), including 426 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles (141 in 1964). They seized 27,000 enemy weapons of various types (equivalent to one and a half times that of 1964). The Southern People's Armed Forces also sank 81 enemy combat boats and warships, damaged 85, and overturned 46 enemy military trains.

    The Liberation Armed Forces removed 15 enemy military sub-districts, 268 strongholds, and 90 watchtowers, forcing the enemy troops in 153 strongholds and watchtowers to surrender or withdraw.

    The communique, in commenting on the great achievements of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces in 1965, pointed out:

    First, in 1965, the Southern People's Armed Forces grew stronger as they fought, defeating 500,000 puppet troops armed by the United States, which forced the US authorities to rush reinforcements in an attempt to save the rapid collapse of the puppet army. This unmasked the US authorities' so-called "aid" and nakedly exposed the true face of the invaders.

    Second, 1965 was the year when the Liberation Armed Forces directly "contested" with the elite-equipped US military and achieved brilliant victories. Although the equipment of the Liberation Armed Forces is simple, they are extremely brave and possess the invincible strength derived from the people's war line. It has grown rapidly in combat, with skillful and flexible command, extraordinary combat bravery, and the ability to actively and proactively strike the enemy under various conditions and environments. It has highly developed the spirit of revolutionary heroism and the absolute superiority in political and spiritual aspects, and has made good use of the enemy's weaknesses in spiritual aspects, actively exerting its strengths in close combat and bayonet combat.

    Third, 1965 was a year of vigorous development and increasing peak of the People's War in the South. This is manifested in:

    ——There has been development in the speed and number of enemy annihilations. The establishment of enemy battalions that were completely annihilated is almost equal to seven times that of 1964, and the second half of the year is one and a half times that of the first half of the year.

    ——The scope of the battlefield has expanded to all areas including mountainous areas, plains, cities, transportation lines, and enemy strongholds and bases in the rear, making the enemy vulnerable to attacks everywhere. The Liberation Armed Forces used the "special rockets" of the People's War to attack the Saigon urban area, making US officers and soldiers restless, and also destroyed hundreds of enemy aircraft at the most heavily defended air bases. Although they allocated millions of dollars for espionage activities and possessed a large number of modern reconnaissance tools, they were still unable to defend against the People's War in the South.

    ——In terms of tactics and combat forms, including the regular war form of the main force and the guerrilla warfare form, both have been developed. These tactics and combat forms have developed rapidly, widely, and diversely, leaving the enemy with no time to deal with them.

    ——The enemy's large-scale "sweeps" were almost all repulsed. In many areas, the Southern military and civilians turned anti-"sweep" operations into active battles to attack and eliminate the enemy.

    ——Areas for encircling and annihilating US troops have become widespread, and combat villages and combat townships are increasing and being consolidated.

    The communique stated that the vigorous development of the People's War fully demonstrates that the patriotic spirit of the people of South Vietnam is increasing and their hatred for the enemy is deepening.

    The communique stated that 1965 was a year of victory for the South Vietnamese people's revolutionary war. US imperialism is increasingly defeated, isolated, and weakened. The truth that the Vietnamese people will win and the US imperialist aggressors will be defeated is clearer than ever before. (Attached picture)

### 高度发扬革命英雄主义精神　把人民战争推向新的高峰  南越人民武装去年同美军直接较量大获胜利  歼灭美军近二万伪军十五万，击落击毁敌机一千三百多架

    高度发扬革命英雄主义精神　把人民战争推向新的高峰
    南越人民武装去年同美军直接较量大获胜利
    歼灭美军近二万伪军十五万，击落击毁敌机一千三百多架
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量指挥部，十五日发表越南南方军民一九六五年的战绩公报说，据不完全统计，越南南方军民在一九六五年一年中作战近四万次，共歼灭敌人十六万七千五百名，其中打死打伤和俘虏美国侵略军一万九千二百名。在这一年中，还有六万名伪军溃散和开小差。
    公报说，在去年一年中，南方人民武装共全歼敌军五十二个营、二百二十七个连和五百九十个排（一九六四年只歼灭敌军八个营、七十一个连和一百零五个排），其中包括美军九个营和十二个连。被全歼的伪军建制高达四十三个营，这个数字相当于一九六四年年末全部伪军的三分之一。这些被全歼的伪军中，包括属于伪军战略预备力量的四个营（占敌人一九六四年年末的战略预备力量的三分之一）、别动部队的十三个营（占一九六四年年末敌人所有别动部队总营数的一半以上）、四个装甲车支团和属于伪军各主力师和独立团的二十二个营。
    一九六五年，南方军民共打落和击毁敌机一千三百三十七架（一九六四年是四百四十九架）。炸毁敌人各种类型的军用车辆一千九百六十辆（一九六四年为七百二十一辆），其中包括M—113两栖装甲车四百二十六辆（一九六四年为一百四十一辆）。缴获敌人各种武器二万七千件（相当于一九六四年的一倍半）。南方人民武装还击沉敌人的战艇、战船八十一艘，击伤八十五艘，炸翻了四十六列敌人的军用列车。
    解放武装力量共拔除敌人十五个军事支区、二百六十八个据点、九十座岗楼，迫使一百五十三个据点和岗楼里的敌军缴械投降或撤走。
    公报在评述越南南方解放武装力量一九六五年所取得的伟大战绩时指出：
    一、在一九六五年中，南方人民武装越战越强，打败了由美国武装起来的五十万伪军，这使美国当局不得不匆忙大举增兵，企图挽救伪军的迅速崩溃。这就剥下了美国当局所谓“援助”的假面具，赤裸裸地暴露出侵略者的原形。
    二、一九六五年是解放武装力量直接同装备精锐的美军进行“较量”，并取得光辉胜利的一年。解放武装力量的装备虽然简陋，但却非常英勇、具有来自人民战争路线的无敌力量。它在战斗中已经迅速成长，指挥机智灵活，战斗勇敢非凡，能在各种条件和环境下，积极地、主动地打击敌人，高度发扬了革命英雄主义精神以及政治和精神方面的绝对优势，很好地利用了敌人在精神方面的弱点，积极发挥打近战、打白刃战的长处。
    三、一九六五年是南方人民战争蓬勃发展和日益走向高峰的一年。这表现在：
    ——在歼灭敌人的速度和数量上都有了发展，仅被全歼的敌军的营的建制，差不多等于一九六四年的七倍，而这一年下半年又相当于上半年的一倍半。
    ——战场的范围已经发展到遍及山区、平原、城市、交通线和敌人后方的各个据点和基地，使敌人处处挨打。解放武装力量使用人民战争的“特种火箭”袭击西贡市区，使美国官兵寝食不安，同时还击毁了得到最严密防卫的空军基地上的成百架敌机。尽管它们拨出数以百万计的美元作为间谍活动费，并且拥有非常多的现代化侦察工具，但在南方人民战争面前仍然防不胜防。
    ——在战术和战斗形式方面，其中包括主力部队的正规战争形式和游击战争形式都得到了发展。这些战术和战斗形式发展得又快、又普遍、又丰富多彩，使敌人来不及对付。
    ——敌人的大小规模“扫荡”，几乎都遭到回击。南方军民在许多地区把反“扫荡”变成主动打击敌人、消灭敌人的战斗。
    ——各个围歼美军地带已普遍出现，战斗村和战斗乡日益增多并且得到了巩固。
    公报说，人民战争的蓬勃发展，充分地说明了越南南方人民的爱国精神日益提高，对敌人的仇恨日益加深。
   公报说，一九六五年，是越南南方人民革命战争胜利的一年。美帝国主义日益失败孤立和削弱。越南人民必胜，美帝国主义侵略者必败这一真理，比任何时候都更加明显。（附图片）
