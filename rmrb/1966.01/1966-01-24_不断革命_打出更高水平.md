    Continuing the Revolution, Achieving Higher Levels
    At this time of welcoming the new and seeing off the old, the thoughts in my mind surge like the rolling mountains. Looking back on the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, extensively studying Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on application, all sectors and industries across the country have achieved brilliant successes.
    I grew up under the Party's meticulous nurturing. Seeing the motherland thriving, prosperous, and full of vitality, I feel boundless pride and happiness deep in my heart.
    In the past few years, during the process of extensively studying Chairman Mao's works, I gradually understood the meaning of "playing table tennis for the revolution." In the 28th World Table Tennis Championships, I overcame some individualistic thoughts such as fearing to lose and carrying the burden of being a world champion, and achieved some victories. But the victory in the competition did not eliminate my inner concerns, and I felt that there would be many difficulties on the road ahead. I was very afraid of losing the honor in the 29th competition. I really hoped that the young players would take over my position and charge into battle. At the beginning of this year, Elder Xu received us. He is already a revolutionary veteran of ninety years old, yet he is still vigorous, insists on exercising, and never forgets the revolution, exercising for the revolution, which moved me deeply. I am only twenty-five years old this year, but I already want to hand over the responsibility, which shows that I do not have lofty ideals and have not established the idea of continuous revolution. Thinking about Elder Xu and comparing myself to him, I feel too ashamed. The fundamental problem here is that I have not truly understood the meaning of "playing table tennis for the revolution," and have not been truly dedicated to the motherland and had a global vision. Achievements have blurred my vision, causing me to confuse the boundary between playing table tennis as a means and as an end.
    Means serve the purpose, but means are not the purpose. We are athletes, and playing table tennis is just a main means of contributing to the world revolution. However, I regarded the means as the purpose, so after winning the championship, all I saw were a few cups, as if the revolution had reached its peak, and I became complacent in my thinking, thinking less about the world revolution.
    The world revolution is a magnificent and glorious cause of mankind, and the achievements we have made in sports are insignificant compared to the world revolution. And playing table tennis is just one sport within sports, and the achievements we have made in playing table tennis are even more like a drop in the ocean. Recognizing this will strengthen our confidence and courage to move forward and continuously make revolution.
    The world revolution is constantly developing, and the improvement of technology is also endless. Only by truly establishing a proletarian world view of playing table tennis for the revolution in our minds can we achieve thorough revolution and continuous revolution. Technically, we can make discoveries, create, and advance. In the new year, I must work hard to study Chairman Mao's works, learn from the continuous revolutionary spirit of Daqing and Dazhai, continuously transform my thinking, learn from the revolutionary veterans, and become a revolutionary successor who is ideologically red, physically strong, professionally proficient, able to endure great hardship and hard work, withstand the test of great storms, and shoulder the heavy burden of revolution.

    不断革命  打出更高水平
    在这迎新送旧之际，心里的思潮象那连绵的山峦一样起伏不定。在回顾过去的一年中，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大学毛主席著作，特别是在用字上下功夫，全国各行各业都取得了辉煌的成就。
    我是在党无微不至的抚育下成长的，看到祖国蒸蒸日上、繁荣富强、一片欣欣向荣的景象，内心深感无比的骄傲和幸福。
    这几年，在大学毛主席著作的过程中，我逐步懂得了“为革命而打球”的道理。在二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛中，克服了一些怕输、背世界冠军包袱等个人主义思想，取得一定的胜利。但比赛的胜利，并不能消除我内心的顾虑，感到在前进道路上还会有很多困难。自己生怕在二十九届比赛中丢掉荣誉。我多么希望年青的队员，接过我的班子去冲锋陷阵。今年年初徐老接见了我们。他已经是九十高龄的革命老前辈了，他还老当益壮，坚持锻炼身体，时刻不忘记革命，为革命而锻炼，给我的感触很深。我今年才二十五岁，却想交班了，说明我没有远大的理想，没有树立起不断革命的思想。想想徐老，比比自己，感到太惭愧了。这里面存在的一个根本问题，就是没有真正懂得“为革命而打球”的道理，做到心怀祖国，放眼世界。成绩模糊了我的视线，使我混淆了打球手段和目的的界限。
    手段是为目的服务的，但手段不是目的。我们是运动员，打球只是为世界革命做出贡献的主要手段。可是，我把手段当作目的，因此在取得冠军后，看到的只是几个杯子，好象革命到顶一样，思想上产生了自满情绪，对世界革命就想得少了。
    世界革命是人类雄伟壮丽的事业，而我们在体育事业方面所取得的成绩和世界革命相比是微不足道的。而打乒乓球又是体育里面一个项目，我们在打球上所作出的一些成绩，更是沧海一粟。这样认识就会增强我们前进的信心和勇气，不断的革命。
    世界革命是不断发展的，技术的提高也是无止境的，只有思想上真正树立起为革命而打球的无产阶级世界观，才能做到彻底革命，不断革命。在技术上有所发现，有所创造，有所前进。在新的一年里，我一定要努力学习主席著作，学习大庆、大寨的不断革命精神，不断地改造思想，向革命的老前辈学习，做一个思想红、身体壮、业务专、能吃大苦耐大劳、经得起大风大浪的考验、挑得起革命重担的革命接班人。
