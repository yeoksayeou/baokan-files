    U.S. aggressive flames of war burn towards Laos
    The Johnson administration is stepping up its military aggression against Laos, trying to turn Laos into a battlefield to coordinate with the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is an important part of the adventurous plan of U.S. imperialism to expand the Indochina War.
    Since last September, U.S. imperialism has instructed the Lao right-wing army to launch a so-called "dry season offensive," repeatedly launching large-scale attacks on the Lao liberated areas. This offensive has been repeatedly frustrated by the heroic resistance of the Lao patriotic army and civilians. But the Johnson administration did not give up. At the beginning of January this year, it again instructed the Lao right-wing to dispatch more than four mobile regiments to continue "mopping up" the liberated areas of Khammouane, Savannakhet, and Saravane provinces. At the same time, the United States also sent a large number of military aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, to repeatedly bomb and strafe many areas in Khammouane, Savannakhet, Xieng Khouang, and Luang Prabang provinces. According to the Associated Press, this "massive bombing" launched by the United States in Laos involved as many as 300 U.S. aircraft per day, dropping and firing nearly 1,000 tons of bombs and rockets. CBS News revealed that this is a "prelude to larger operations" in the U.S. war plan.
    The large-scale and frantic offensive launched by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Laos from land and air shows that its military activity this time is not only a general act of provocation, harassment, and nibbling, but also a complete tearing up of the 1962 Geneva Accords, expanding the war, and linking Vietnam and Laos into one battlefield.
    In order to launch such a new military adventure against Laos, U.S. imperialism has long been fully prepared. From military to political, both inside and outside Laos, it has made careful arrangements and is carrying them out step by step in a planned way.
    Since the second half of last year, the United States has stepped up the transportation of large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and other war materials to Laos. It has accelerated the construction of Highway 13, which runs through Laos from north to south, and expanded the military airports in Vientiane, Savannakhet, Pakse, and Salavan. It instructed the Lao Vientiane authorities to further expand their military and prepare for war, organized right-wing troops and bandits to launch attacks on the Lao liberated areas, and declared a state of emergency in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces.
    The Johnson administration is also using Thailand as an outpost for attacking Laos. The United States has already built and expanded forty or fifty naval and air force bases in Thailand, established secret missile bases in Korat, Ubon Ratchathani, and Lampang, and also built a series of strategic road networks in the border areas between Thailand and Laos. It is particularly noteworthy that the United States is currently carrying out tense military construction in Sattahip along the Gulf of Siam, intending to build this Thai port into a large deep-water port for U.S. warships, and to build an air force base there capable of accommodating the largest U.S. bombers. The New York Times said that these military measures would allow several divisions of U.S. troops to land in Sattahip by sea and air, "thereby enhancing the ability of U.S. forces to advance on a large scale into Laos."
    It is worth noting that various signs indicate that the Johnson administration is also preparing to send U.S. and its servants Thailand and South Vietnam puppet ground forces to occupy the central and lower Laos regions. In early December last year, McNamara released a test balloon that the United States would send troops into Laos. Subsequently, Rusk fabricated rumors of "North Vietnamese troops" "infiltrating South Vietnam through Laos." Then, on December 21, the U.S. State Department spokesman announced that the U.S. military in South Vietnam had the right to expand the war to Laos and Cambodia in the name of "pursuing the Viet Cong." On January 13 this year, Harriman personally ran to Vientiane, saying that "North Vietnam intends to occupy Laos," which in fact shows that the Johnson administration is attempting to send U.S. troops into Laos.
    The Johnson administration is trying to find a way out by expanding the war to Laos. However, Laos, like South Vietnam, will only get deeper and deeper for the invaders. The military offensive launched by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos has suffered and will continue to suffer heavy defeats. From November to December 18 last year, the Lao patriotic army and civilians wiped out more than 700 enemies and crushed seven enemy battalions. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on January 17, reiterating the Lao people's "iron determination to resist America and save the country to the end," and expressing their intention to "fight alongside the fraternal Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism," "making Laos a graveyard for burying U.S. aggressors." The statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front is a powerful answer to the U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. It fully demonstrates the Lao people's determination and confidence to dare to fight U.S. imperialism to the end.

### 美国侵略战火烧向老挝

    美国侵略战火烧向老挝
    约翰逊政府正在加紧对老挝进行军事侵略，力图把老挝变成一个配合侵越战争的战场。这是美帝国主义扩大印度支那战争的冒险计划的重要组成部分。
    去年九月以来，美帝国主义指使老挝右派军队发动了所谓“旱季攻势”，一再大规模进攻老挝解放区。这个攻势在老挝爱国军民的英勇抗击下，接连受挫。但是约翰逊政府没有死心。今年一月初，它又指使老挝右派，出动四个机动团以上的兵力，向甘蒙、沙湾拿吉和巴色省的解放区继续进行“扫荡”。与此同时，美国还派遣包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的大批军用飞机，对甘蒙、沙湾拿吉、川圹和琅勃拉邦等省的许多地区，一再进行轰炸和扫射。据美联社报道，美国在老挝发动的这个“大规模的轰炸”，每天多达三百架美国飞机，投掷和发射了将近一千吨炸弹和火箭。美国哥伦比亚广播公司透露，这是美国战争计划中的“更大的作战行动的前奏”。
    美帝国主义及其走狗从陆上和空中，对老挝发动大规模的疯狂进攻，表明它的这次军事活动，不仅是一般的挑衅、侵扰和蚕食性质，而且是要彻底撕毁一九六二年的日内瓦协议，扩大战火，把越南和老挝联结成一个战场。
    为了对老挝发动这样一场新的军事冒险，美帝国主义早就进行了充分准备。从军事到政治，在老挝国内和国外，它都作了周密的部署，并且正在一步步地有计划地进行。
    去年下半年以后，美国加紧向老挝运进大批武器、弹药和其他战争物资。它加紧修筑贯通老挝南北的第十三号公路，扩建万象、沙湾拿吉、巴色和沙拉湾的军用机场。它指使老挝万象当局进一步扩军备战，组织右派军队和土匪，向老挝解放区发动进攻，并且宣布甘蒙省和沙湾拿吉省处于紧急状态。
    约翰逊政府还利用泰国，作为进攻老挝的前哨阵地。美国在泰国已经修建和扩建了四、五十个海、空军基地，在呵叻、乌汶、喃邦等地建立了秘密导弹基地，还在泰国和老挝边境地区修筑了一系列的战略公路网。特别值得注意的是，目前美国正在暹罗湾沿岸的梭桃邑进行紧张的军事施工，要把这个泰国港口建成一个供美国军舰使用的大型深水港，并且在那里建设一个能容纳最大型美国轰炸机的空军基地。《纽约时报》说，这些军事措施，将使得几个师的美国军队可以从海路和空路在梭桃邑登陆，“从而增强美军大规模向老挝境内推进的能力”。
    值得人们注意的是，种种迹象表明，约翰逊政府还准备派遣美国及其仆从泰国和南越傀儡的地面部队，占领中、下寮地区。去年十二月初，麦克纳马拉就放出了美国将派兵进入老挝的试探气球。接着，腊斯克大肆捏造“北越军队”“通过老挝渗入南越”的谣言。接着，美国国务院发言人在十二月二十一日宣布，南越美军有权以“追击越共”为名，把战争扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。今年一月十三日，哈里曼亲自跑到万象，说什么“北越打算占领老挝”，这实际上正好表明，约翰逊政府企图把美军开进老挝。
    约翰逊政府企图用把战火扩大到老挝的手段来寻找出路。但是，老挝也同南越一样，侵略者从这里陷进去，只会愈陷愈深。美帝国主义及其走狗在老挝发动的军事进攻，已经遭到并将继续遭到惨重的失败。老挝爱国军民从去年十一月到十二月十八日，共歼灭敌人七百多名，击溃敌人七个营。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一月十七日发表声明，重申老挝人民“抗美救国到底的钢铁决心”，表示要“同兄弟的越南人民和柬埔寨人民为反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义，并肩战斗”，“使老挝成为埋葬美国侵略者的坟地”。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的声明是对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的一个有力回答。它充分表现了老挝人民敢于同美帝国主义斗争到底的决心和信心。
