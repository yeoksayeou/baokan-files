    The Thanom Government Intensifies Suppression of Thai People's Struggle
    Actually Decides to Establish Disguised Concentration Camps in Thailand Modeled After South Vietnam's "Strategic Hamlets"
    Cabinet Meeting Decides to Conduct Comprehensive War Preparations Based on American Intentions
    (Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 27th) News: In order to intensify the suppression of patriotic forces in Thailand, the Thai authorities have decided to emulate the brutal method of establishing "strategic hamlets" in South Vietnam by the United States and establish this kind of disguised concentration camp in some areas of Thailand.
    Thai Deputy Minister of Interior Thain announced on the 24th that the Thai cabinet had approved a plan to relocate residents of so-called "dangerous areas." According to this plan, small villages of five to ten households scattered in these areas will be moved to places close to towns and "merged" into large villages.
    At the same time, some large villages in these areas where patriotic armed forces often appear will also be moved. Thain said that this plan will be implemented first in the northeastern region of Thailand.
    Thai Prime Minister Thanom revealed on the 20th that the Thai authorities have established a so-called "Special Anti-Communist Command," jointly composed of the army and police, to be responsible for directing the suppression of patriotic forces in Thailand.
    Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Praphas Charusathien recently admitted at a press conference that patriotic armed forces have appeared in the northeastern, southern, and western regions of Thailand, and several remote counties have been occupied by patriotic armed forces.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok) News: The Thai authorities are stepping up war preparations based on American intentions.
    A proposal passed at the cabinet meeting on the 18th decided to cancel the rotation leave system for active-duty soldiers and conduct comprehensive military training for the active-duty army, navy, and air force.
    Thai newspapers pointed out that it is the first time in Thailand that the Ministry of Defense directly commands and comprehensive war preparations are carried out under the leadership of the Chief of Staff of the Three Armed Forces, Thawi Chullasapya.
    Thai Deputy Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff of the Three Armed Forces, Thawi Chullasapya, announced to reporters after attending the cabinet meeting that the Thai government had decided to increase the military budget. He said that according to this decision, Thailand will enrich manpower, weapons, and strategic materials in order to improve the "combat capability" of the army.

    他侬政府加紧镇压泰国人民斗争
    竟决定仿照南越“战略村”在泰国建立变相集中营
    内阁会议根据美国意图决定进行全面备战活动
    据新华社二十七日讯　曼谷消息：泰国当局为了加紧镇压泰国爱国力量，决定仿效美国在南越建立“战略村”的残暴办法，在泰国一些地区建立这种变相的集中营。
    泰国内政部副部长他因二十四日宣布，泰国内阁已经批准了一项迁移所谓“危险地区”的居民的计划。根据这个计划，将把这些地区内分散的五户到十户的小村落，迁移到接近城镇的地方，“合并”成为大村落。
    同时，这些地区内的一些经常有爱国武装出现的大村落也要迁走。他因说，这个计划将首先在泰国东北部地区实施。
    泰国总理他侬二十日透露，泰国当局已经建立了一个由军队和警察联合组成的所谓“剿共特别指挥部”，负责指挥镇压泰国的爱国力量。
    泰国副总理兼陆军总司令巴博最近在一次记者招待会上承认，在泰国东北部、南部和西部等地区都出现了爱国武装，若干偏僻的县区已被爱国武装占领。
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：泰国当局正在根据美国的意图加紧进行备战活动。
    在十八日举行的内阁会议上通过的一项提案决定，取消现役军人的轮流休假制度，对现役的陆、海、空三军进行全面的军事训练。
    泰国报纸指出，由国防部直接指挥并在三军总参谋长他威统率下进行全面备战，这在泰国还是第一次。
    泰国国防部副部长、三军总参谋长他威在参加内阁会议后对记者宣布，泰国政府决定增加军事预算。他说，根据这个决定，泰国将充实人力、武器和战略物资，以提高军队的
  “作战能力”。
