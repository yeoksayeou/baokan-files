    This article was sent from the distant Tibet Autonomous Region. From the article, we can see that the issue of the revolutionization of county committee leadership has aroused deep concern among some county committee comrades working in the area known as the "Roof of the World," which is gratifying. The author of this article, with the question raised by this column, combined with his own practice, and in response to the issue of whether or not to "urge plowing and sowing," made a more in-depth analysis and put forward his own understanding. We welcome more county committee comrades working in remote areas to actively participate in the discussion like Comrade Li Dalun. – Editor

      I have clipped out all the "Realize the Revolutionization of County Committee Leadership" discussion columns in the *People's Daily* and carry them with me, reading them frequently.
    I cannot agree with some of the arguments in the article "Why Only Grasp Old Patterns" in the fourth issue of the discussion column (October 22, 1965).
    The article says "...The method of simply urging progress according to the agricultural season is a method of leading production that we learned when we established mutual aid teams. It is a method of leadership that is adapted to the handicraft production of the small-scale peasant economy." "What we have to lead is no longer the small-scale peasant economy of mutual aid teams, but the collective economy of the people's commune... In this case, only grasping timely hoeing, weeding, harvesting, and cutting can no longer adapt to the needs of the new situation." "The objective situation has undergone great changes, and our thinking is still bound by the old patterns of leading the small-scale peasant economy... ." These statements raise a series of questions for me: Is the method of urging progress according to the agricultural season adapted to leading the small-scale peasant economy? Is leading the small-scale peasant economy of mutual aid teams only about urging plowing and sowing? Is the inability to lead the collective economy of the people's commune well entirely due to being bound by the old patterns of leading the small-scale peasant economy?
    The author of the article may have adopted a simple method of urging plowing and sowing during the period of mutual aid teams and the small-scale peasant economy. In fact, whether in the period of mutual aid teams and the small-scale peasant economy, or in the period of the collective economy of the people's commune, the simple method of urging plowing and sowing is unworkable or ineffective. I have a deep understanding of this both in the interior and now in Tibet. This method of leading production will only have two results: one is to follow behind the agricultural season and play a role in urging statistical figures; the other is to be divorced from the masses and issue mandatory orders. Because farmers know when to plant and when to harvest, there is no need for us to urge them; to promote an advanced agricultural technology, it is also impossible to promote it simply by urging. No matter what work we do, we cannot simply rely on urging, and the most important thing is to rely on ideological work. Even Comrade Wang Yingke's article "'Dividing One into Two' to See Urging Plowing and Sowing" (see page 2 of this newspaper on November 22) also said that in their commune, the promotion of intercropping corn with soybeans was also achieved after "persuading the masses patiently with many examples," rather than simply adopting the method of urging plowing and sowing.
    The word "urge" in the method of leading agricultural production has only two meanings: one is to worry that the masses are lagging behind and need to be urged, and the other is to think that the masses are already lagging behind and need to be urged. In fact, urging back and forth is either coercion and commandism, or following behind the masses and the season, which exactly shows that we are lagging behind.
    In our Qamdo County, we are currently leading agricultural mutual aid organizations, which are all small-scale peasant economies. If our leadership of agricultural production is simply focused on the method of urging progress, it would take more than ten days to travel back and forth to the most remote districts and townships, and it would be difficult for us to do a good job by simply urging. In the past few years, we also simply urged plowing and sowing, but later we realized that using this thinking to lead production, our work would either lag behind the masses or be coercion and commandism.
    Since the year before last, our county committee has gone down to stay at selected points, and after in-depth investigations, we have discovered that many of the figures we originally urged do not reflect the essence of the problem. For example, the original statistics showed that an average of 20 loads of fertilizer were applied per *ke* of land (one *ke* equals one *mu*), but some poor peasants only applied 5 to 10 loads per *ke* of land, and some still sowed seeds in bare ground; it was also found that in previous years, rich peasants were at the forefront of agricultural activities such as spring plowing and sowing, field management, and autumn harvesting and threshing, while poor peasants were lagging behind, mainly because the leadership of the mutual aid teams was not truly in the hands of poor peasants. In response to the above problems, last year, in addition to helping poor peasants accumulate and manufacture fertilizer in various ways, we also carried out a rectification of mutual aid teams throughout the county with the establishment of the leadership advantage of poor peasants as the central content. This basically reversed the phenomenon of unreasonable arrangements of agricultural work and the suppression and exclusion of poor peasants in the mutual aid teams. Last year, because we grasped and solved some substantive problems in leading mutual aid teams and agricultural production, conscientiously implemented the class line, and clearly recognized who to rely on and what kind of production to develop, the production development of all classes in Qamdo County was more balanced than in previous years, and we achieved the seventh bumper harvest year since the suppression of the rebellion and reform. The total grain output of the county increased by about 7% compared with 1964.
    It should also be specially mentioned here that in Tibet, during the period of running mutual aid teams and small-scale peasant economy, there appeared a Dazhai-style typical example – Pari District and Langsheng Mutual Aid Team. If, according to some comrades, the leadership of mutual aid teams can only adopt the method of urging progress, could such typical examples have emerged?
    Since even leading mutual aid teams cannot simply adopt the method of "urging plowing and sowing," where did the old pattern of leading agricultural production by simply "urging progress" come from? I think the key issue is that the thinking of the leaders has not been revolutionized, they have not established the idea of "serving the people wholeheartedly," and they have not taken responsibility for the revolution. That is to say, the leaders have been staying in a state of mind of "not using their brains and doing nothing" for a long time.

### 这恰好说明领导落后了

专栏：

    这恰好说明领导落后了
    这是由遥远的西藏自治区寄来的文章。从文中可以看到：县委领导革命化的问题，已经引起了工作在这素称“世界屋脊”地区的一些县委同志的深切注意，这是值得高兴的。本文作者带着这个专栏提出的问题，结合自己的实践，对应不应当“催耕催种”问题，作了比较深入的分析，提出了自己的认识。我们欢迎更多的工作在边远地区的县委同志们，也能象李达伦同志这样踊跃参加讨论。——编者
      《人民日报》开展“实现县委领导革命化”的讨论的专栏，我都剪下来带在身边，经常阅读。
    讨论专栏第四期（一九六五年十月二十二日）《为什么只抓老套套》这篇文章中，有些论点我是不能同意的。
    文章说“……跟着农事季节单纯催进度的办法，是我们从办互助组时就学会的领导生产的方法。它是适应小农经济的手工业生产的领导方法。”“我们要领导的已经不是互助组那样的小农经济，而是人民公社集体经济，……。在这种情况下，只抓按时铲、趟、收、割，已经不能适应新的形势发展的需要了。”“客观情况已经有了很大变化，我们的思想还受着领导小农经济的老套套的束缚，……。”这些提法引起我一系列的疑问：难道跟着农事季节催进度的方法，是适应领导小农经济的方法吗？难道领导互助组那样的小农经济就只是催耕催种吗？难道不能很好地领导人民公社的集体经济完全是受着领导小农经济的老套套的束缚吗？
    文章的作者，可能在互助组、小农经济时期，是采取单纯的催耕催种的领导生产的办法。其实，不管是在互助组、小农经济时期也好，还是在人民公社的集体经济时期也好，单纯的催耕催种这种办法，都是行不通的，或者是不起作用的。对这一点，我过去在内地和目前在西藏都有深切的体会。这种领导生产的办法只会有两种结果：一种是跟在农事季节后面，起个催统计数字的作用；一种是脱离群众，强迫命令。因为何时种何时收，农民很清楚，不用我们催；要推广一项先进的农业技术，也是不能单靠催就能推广的。我们不论做什么工作，都不能单纯的靠催，而最最重要的是靠思想工作。就是汪盈科同志的《“一分为二”看催耕催种》一文（见十一月二十二日本报二版），也这样说，在他们那个公社推广玉米间作黄豆，也是“用很多事例耐心说服群众”后，才推广的，而不是单纯采取催耕催种的方法实现的。
    在领导农业生产方法上的“催”字，不外乎有两个含意，一是担心群众落后，要催，二是认为群众已经落后了，要催。实际上催来催去，不是强迫命令，便是跟在群众和季节后头转，恰恰是我们落后了。
    在我们察雅县，目前领导的还都是农业互助组织，都是小农经济。如果我们领导农业生产单纯停留在催进度的方法上，最远的区乡来回一次，就得十多天，我们光靠催是很难搞好工作的。前几年我们也是单纯的催耕催种，但后来认识到用这种思想领导生产，我们工作不是落在群众后面，便是强迫命令。
    前年以来，我们县委下去蹲点，经过深入的调查，才发现我们原来催来的数字，有很多不能反映出实质问题。比如原来统计每克地（一克等于一亩）平均施肥有二十驮，但有些贫苦农民每克地只有五至十驮，有的还是白地下种；还发现往年春耕播种、田间管理、秋收打场等农事活动，多是富裕农民走在前头，贫苦农民落在后头，主要原因是互助组的领导权没有真正掌握在贫苦农民手里。针对上述问题，去年我们除从各方面帮助贫苦农民积肥造肥外，还在全县开展了以树立贫苦农民领导优势为中心内容的整顿互助组工作，这才基本扭转了互助组安排农活不合理、打击排斥贫苦农民的现象。去年由于我们抓住解决了领导互助组和农业生产方面的一些实质性的问题，认真贯彻执行了阶级路线，认清楚了依靠谁和发展什么样的生产的问题，因而察雅县各阶层的生产发展比往年平衡一些了，全面获得了平叛改革以来的第七个丰收年，全县的粮食产量约比一九六四年增产百分之七。
    这里还特别提一下，西藏在办互助组和小农经济时期，出现了大寨式的典型——帕里区和朗生互助组，如果按照有的同志的说法，领导互助组只能采取催进度的方法，这样的典型能出现吗？
    既然领导互助组也不能单纯采取“催耕催种”的方法，那么单纯“催进度”的领导农业生产的老套套究竟是从那里来的呢？我认为关键问题是领导者的思想没有革命化，没有树立“全心全意”为人民服务的思想，没有对革命负起责任来。也就是领导者长期停留在“不用脑筋，无所作为”的这样的思想状态中。
