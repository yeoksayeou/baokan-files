    The set of news items published here reflects the rapid development of agricultural production, the flourishing of cultural and educational undertakings, and the outstanding achievements of medical work in the liberated areas of South Vietnam. It is inspiring to read.
    In the long war of resistance against the United States, the environment in the South Vietnamese liberated areas is very arduous, and the South Vietnamese people face many difficulties. However, the liberated South Vietnamese people, with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, overcome all difficulties and create a new life in the liberated areas. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "No difficulty can hinder the progress of man, as long as he struggles and perseveres, the difficulty will be driven away."
    The American bandits vainly attempt to use the "three alls policy" and the "scorched earth policy" to raze the South Vietnamese jungle to the ground and slaughter the South Vietnamese people. This will never be possible. The ever-expanding liberated areas of South Vietnam, with their thriving scene, are precisely illustrating that the South Vietnamese people will win and the American bandits will be defeated!

    这里刊登的一组消息，反映了越南南方解放区农业生产的迅速发展，文化教育事业的欣欣向荣以及医疗工作的出色成绩。读后令人感奋。
    在长期的抗美战争中，南越解放区的环境是很艰苦的，南越人民面对着许许多多的困难。但是，解放了的南越人民，以自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，排除万难，创造着解放区的新生活。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“没有什么困难可以阻碍人的前进的，只要奋斗，加以坚持，困难就赶跑了。”
    美国强盗妄图用“三光政策”和“焦土政策”把南越丛林夷为平地，把南越人民斩尽杀绝。这是永远办不到的。不断扩大的南越解放区一片兴旺的景象，正说明南越人民必胜，美国强盗必败！
