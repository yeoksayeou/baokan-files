    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 5th. Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary pointing out that in 1965, the anti-American patriotic movement had become a movement deeply rooted in all levels of the Lao people. In that year, Lao patriotic forces were continuously consolidated, developed, and strengthened. The liberated area, accounting for two-thirds of the country's area, was further expanded in that year.
    In the past year, Lao patriotic forces eliminated nearly 7,000 enemies and shot down more than 200 American aircraft, causing the enemy's attempts to eliminate the Lao patriotic forces to suffer heavy defeats.
    The commentary said that in the past year, the heroic fighting spirit of the Lao patriotic army has been further improved, especially in the ability to get close to the enemy in battle, engage in bayonet charges, eliminate the enemy, and defeat the many with the few.
    All patriotic armed forces have rapidly developed and improved in both quantity and quality. There has also been great progress in tactics and combat techniques.
    Militia guerrillas have also been further widely developed throughout the country. The people of Xieng Khouang and Sam Neua provinces have organized guerrilla groups to hunt down American bandit aircraft. Thousands of people in Khammouane Province volunteered to supply and transport materials for the troops.
    The commentary said that in the past year, the people of all ethnic groups in the Lao liberated areas have worked hard to increase production and support the front lines. The people of the Savannakhet liberated area have transformed hillside land into rice paddies, doubling the planting area. Some places in the liberated areas of Sam Neua and Xieng Khouang have turned single-cropping fields into double-cropping fields. The democratic governments in the liberated areas of Savannakhet and Khammouane provinces have also helped the people restore and develop the textile industry. In many places, the Lao Patriotic Front committees and democratic governments mobilized the people to open up and build roads to make transportation more convenient. In addition, many schools have been opened everywhere. There are middle schools in the liberated areas of Sam Neua, Xieng Khouang, Luang Prabang, and Savannakhet. In this year, the Lao Sung people also enthusiastically launched a study movement to learn the newly created script of their own ethnic group.
    The commentary pointed out that at present, American imperialism and its lackeys are preparing to expand their war of aggression in South Vietnam to the entire Indochina. Therefore, in 1966, the Lao people must strengthen their close unity with the people of all Indochinese countries, resolutely fight, eliminate the American aggressors and their lackeys, and strive for greater victories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 5th. Colonel Deuane, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces Command, wrote letters to all officers and soldiers of the Kong Le troops and the Lao right-wing troops in the New Year, calling on them to refuse to obey the orders of American imperialism and the Lao right-wing group to slaughter the Lao people, and to revolt and return to the people.
    In a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Kong Le troops, Colonel Deuane pointed out, "Your best way out is to stop hostile acts against the country and the people. You once had the glorious tradition of the 'August 9th' coup d'état, in which you did not bow down to American imperialism." "If you show a noble sense of patriotism, you will be warmly welcomed by the country and the people, and you will receive the sincere cooperation and help of the national patriotic forces."
    In a letter to the officers and soldiers of the Lao right-wing troops, Colonel Deuane said, "Your fate is being thrown into the war that American imperialism is trying to expand its aggression against Laos. Therefore, your lives are not guaranteed." He then called on them to "hold an uprising like the Second Parachute Battalion in 1960, kill their reactionary masters, and cooperate with the people and patriotic forces."
    Colonel Deuane warned the officers and soldiers of the right-wing army not to continue to slaughter, deceive, and threaten the people.
    In both letters, Colonel Deuane also warned that if anyone remains stubbornly to the end, then he will certainly not escape the fate of the recently annihilated headquarters of the 13th Mobile Regiment.

    老挝爱国军队在战斗中壮大发展  去年歼敌七千击落美机二百多架
    敦上校号召贡勒部队和右派部队官兵起义归向人民
    新华社康开五日电　巴特寮电台发表评论指出，在一九六五年中，反美爱国运动已成为深入老挝全国各阶层人民的运动。老挝爱国力量在这一年里不断巩固、发展和壮大。占全国面积三分之二的解放区在这一年里又进一步扩大了。
    在过去一年中，老挝爱国力量共消灭近七千名敌人，打落二百多架美国飞机，使敌人妄图消灭老挝爱国力量的各次进攻均遭到惨重失败。
    评论说，过去一年中，老挝爱国军队的英勇战斗精神进一步有了提高，尤其是在战斗中能够逼近敌人，打白刃战，消灭敌人，并且能够以少胜多。
    各爱国武装力量在数量和质量上都有了迅速的发展和提高。在战术和战斗技术方面也有了很大进步。
    民兵游击队也进一步在各地广泛发展起来。川圹、桑怒两省人民都组织了狩猎美国强盗飞机的游击小组。甘蒙省成千名群众志愿给部队供应和运输物资。
    评论说，老挝解放区各族人民在过去一年中努力增加生产，支援前线。沙湾拿吉解放区人民把山坡地改造成稻田，扩大种植面积一倍。桑怒和川圹等解放区的一些地方把一造田变成了两造田。沙湾拿吉和甘蒙等省解放区民主政权还帮助人民恢复和发展了纺织业。许多地方的爱国战线党委员会和民主政权动员人民开辟和修筑公路，使交通更为方便。此外，各地都开办了许多学校。桑怒、川圹、琅勃拉邦和沙湾拿吉等解放区都有了中学。寮松族人民在这一年还热烈地展开了学习新创造的本民族文字的学习运动。
    评论指出，目前，美帝国主义和它的走狗们正准备把它们在南越的侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。因此，在一九六六年，老挝人民必须加强同印度支那各国人民的紧密团结，坚决战斗，消灭美国侵略者及其走狗，争取更大的胜利。
    新华社康开五日电　老挝爱国中立力量指挥部总指挥敦上校在新年分别写信给贡勒部队的全体官兵和老挝右派部队官兵，号召他们拒绝听从美帝国主义和老挝右派集团驱使他们屠杀老挝人民的命令，并且起义归向人民。
    敦上校在写给贡勒部队的全体官兵的信中指出，“你们最好的出路是：停止同国家和人民的敌对行为。你们曾经有过不向美帝国主义低头屈膝的‘八·九’政变光荣传统。”“如果你们表现出崇高的爱国感，那么你们定会受到国家和人民的热烈欢迎，并定会得到全国爱国力量的真诚合作和帮助。”
    敦上校在写给老挝右派部队官兵的信中说，“你们的命运正处在被投入美帝国主义企图扩大侵略老挝的战争之中。因此你们的生命是毫无保证的。”他接着号召他们“象一九六○年第二伞兵营那样举行起义，打死自己的反动主子，并同人民和爱国力量合作”。
    敦上校警告右派军队的官兵们，不要继续屠杀、欺骗、威胁人民。
    敦上校在这两封信中还提出警告说，如果谁仍然顽固到底，那么他一定逃脱不了象最近被歼灭的第十三机动团团部的命运。
