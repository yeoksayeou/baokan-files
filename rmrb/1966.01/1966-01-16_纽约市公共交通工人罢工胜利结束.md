    According to Xinhua News Agency, New York: The strike by more than 35,000 subway and bus workers in New York City, which began on New Year's Day, ended victoriously on the 13th. The city's transportation authorities had to partially meet the workers' demands for higher wages.
    This twelve-day strike was caused by the city's transportation authorities' refusal to meet the workers' legitimate demands to sign a new contract that would improve working conditions and increase wages. During the strike, the federal government, the New York State judicial authorities, and the New York City authorities used high-pressure tactics to force the workers to return to work, but they were met with the workers' resolute resistance.

    纽约市公共交通工人罢工胜利结束
    据新华社十四日讯　纽约消息：纽约市三万五千多名地下铁道和公共汽车工人从元旦开始的大罢工，在十三日胜利结束。市运输当局不得不部分满足了工人们提高工资的要求。
    这次持续十二天的罢工是因为市运输当局拒绝工人们提出签订一项改善劳动条件和提高工资的新合同的正当要求而引起的。在罢工期间，联邦政府、纽约州司法当局和纽约市当局曾使用高压手段迫使工人复工，但都遭到了工人们的坚决抗击。
