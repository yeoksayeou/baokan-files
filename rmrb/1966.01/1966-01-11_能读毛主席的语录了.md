    Able to Read Chairman Mao's Quotations...
    Liu Mingduo, Director of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region

    After reading the two articles in this edition, readers must be very concerned about Comrade Mai Xiande's current health! We have asked Doctor Liu Mingduo to briefly introduce his situation as follows:

    Comrade Mai Xiande, after being wounded, was first treated in a local hospital, and was transferred to the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region on August 15th of last year for continued treatment. When he was first transferred to our hospital, he still had impaired consciousness, could not speak, and could not eat; the optic nerve papilla had edema; because of a fracture in the right side of the cribriform plate in the anterior cranial fossa and a large rupture in the dura mater there, cerebrospinal fluid often flowed from his right nostril.

    After treatment, nursing care, and brain surgery, his consciousness gradually recovered, the optic nerve papilla edema has subsided, and the cribriform plate fracture and dura mater rupture have been surgically repaired, so cerebrospinal fluid no longer flows from his nostril. Now, he can eat on his own, and can walk on his own; he can recite Chairman Mao's quotations, and can write with his left hand; he can sing songs such as "I am a Soldier," "The East is Red," "Learn from Lei Feng's Good Example" and "Chairman Mao's Soldiers Are Most Loyal to the Party." However, his speech is still poor, and he can only give simple answers, and his right hand is not very flexible, and his movements are relatively slow. Currently, we are working hard to further restore Comrade Mai Xiande's health. (Attached image)

    Heroic and spirited, full of fighting will, what does it matter to be seriously wounded? If we don't sink the enemy ship to the bottom of the sea, how can heroes leave the battlefield!

     Train, train, and train again, making the heroic warrior as strong as steel, step on the illness underfoot, return to your post and build merit.

    Difficulties are common, no difficult words in the hero's heart, unyielding practice of kung fu, wholeheartedly building great aspirations for the Party.

    能读毛主席的语录了……
    广州部队总医院神经外科主任  刘明铎
    读了本版的两篇通讯，读者同志们一定很关心麦贤得同志目前的健康状况吧！我们请刘明铎大夫简要地介绍他的情况如下：
    麦贤得同志负伤后，先在某地医院治疗，去年八月十五日转入广州部队总医院继续治疗。刚转入我院时，还有意识障碍，不能说话，也不能吃东西；视神经乳头有水肿；因为颅前凹右侧筛板处有骨折和该处脑膜有很大的破损，脑脊液时常由右鼻孔流出来。
    经过治疗、护理和脑部手术，意识逐步恢复，视神经乳头水肿已消退，筛板骨折和脑膜破损已用手术修补好了，鼻孔不再流脑脊液了。现在，已能自己吃东西，能自己走动；能念毛主席语录，能用左手写字；能唱《我是一个兵》、《东方红》、《学习雷锋好榜样》和《毛主席的战士最听党的话》等歌曲了。但讲话还差，只能作简单答话，右手不大灵活，动作比较迟缓。目前，我们正在为进一步恢复麦贤得同志的健康而努力。（附图片）

    雄姿焕发斗志昂，身负重伤又何妨，不将敌舰沉海底，英雄岂能下战场！
    吕恩谊  于国良画
     锻炼锻炼再锻炼，英雄战士钢铁坚，要把病魔踏脚下，重返岗位把功建。
    困难本是寻常事，英雄心中无难字，百折不挠练功夫，一心为党树大志。
