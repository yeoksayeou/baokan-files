    Lhasa (Xinhua News Agency, January 8th) On the eve of New Year's Day 1966, another 300 impoverished Lhasa citizens moved into new homes.
    Before the democratic reform, these residents were mostly beggars who slept on the streets, tent dwellers, slaves of landlords, and small handicraft workers. On New Year's Eve, a reporter visited the newly built No. 49 Courtyard on Jiri Street. All of the thirty-plus households here had recently moved in. Many people were joyfully sweeping the courtyards and houses. The rooms upstairs and downstairs were equipped with electric lights, and the interiors were sunny and clean. Every household had a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall. Most households had two rooms, and even those with the smallest population had one large room, with their clothes and belongings neatly arranged.
    Zhuoma Quzhen, the residents' group leader of this courtyard, said that this place used to be a beef market before the democratic reform. This year, the state allocated special funds to build these new houses. If the serf system had not been overthrown, it would have been impossible to live in such good houses.
    The reporter also visited the new home of the Bianba couple. Bianba used to be a slave for the big serf owner Pala for eighteen years, living in a small house under the landlord's toilet for many years. Now, the couple lives in one and a half new rooms, filled with newly harvested grain and vegetables. The house has bright glass windows on both sides. Bianba pointed to the house and said: "In the past, only landlords could live in this kind of house, there was no chance for us!"
    After the democratic reform, the living conditions of Lhasa citizens have improved significantly, and all three hundred dilapidated tents that filled the streets have been removed. All the vagrant beggars, who originally accounted for one-fifth of the total number of residents, now have fixed jobs and housing. In recent years, the People's Government has built or renovated a batch of houses for citizens every year.

### 拉萨又有一批贫苦市民迁入新居

    拉萨又有一批贫苦市民迁入新居
    新华社拉萨八日电　一九六六年元旦前夕，拉萨市又有三百户贫苦市民迁入新居。
    这些居民在民主改革前大都是露宿街头的乞丐、帐篷户、领主的奴隶和小手工业者。新年前夕，记者来到吉日街新建的四十九号大院。这里的三十多户居民全是新近搬进来的。许多人正在喜气洋洋地洒扫庭院和住房。这里楼上楼下的房间里都装了电灯，室内阳光充足，窗明几净，家家户户的墙上都挂着毛主席象。一般住户大都有两个房间，人口最少的也有一个大间，房里的衣物都放得井井有条。
    这个大院的居民组长卓玛曲珍说，民主改革前，这里原是一个牛肉市场。今年国家拨出专款，修筑了这些新房。如果不是推翻了农奴制度，要住上这样好的房子，根本办不到。
    记者还访问了边巴夫妇的新居。边巴过去给大农奴主帕拉当了十八年的奴隶，长年住在领主厕所下面的小屋里，现在夫妇两人住了一间半新房子，里面堆放着新收的粮食和蔬菜。房子两边都是明亮的玻璃窗。边巴指着房子说：“过去这房子只有领主才能住，那有我们的份！”
    民主改革后，拉萨市民的居住条件有了显著改善，充斥在街头巷尾的三百顶破帐篷已全部拆除。原来占居民总数五分之一的游民乞丐都有了固定的职业和住房。这几年，人民政府每年都为市民新修或整修一批住房。
