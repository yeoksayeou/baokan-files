    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 2nd - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 2nd: US-South Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodian territory on multiple occasions in December of last year, and dispatched aircraft to bomb and strafe villages. The Cambodian army repelled their intrusions.
    Two US-South Vietnamese helicopters intruded into Cambodian airspace at around 6:00 AM on December 31st, flying over the provincial defense force post of Batu village in Svay Rieng province multiple times. Subsequently, approximately 50 aircraft transported troops to the vicinity of the border.
    On the same day, at around 9:00 AM, another group of South Vietnamese armed personnel invaded Cambodian territory near Batu village, penetrating approximately one kilometer. They were soon repelled by the Cambodian defense forces.
    Simultaneously, three US-South Vietnamese "Skyraider" aircraft flew over the provincial defense force post of Batu village multiple times, dropping three napalm bombs approximately 600 meters inside Cambodian territory, injuring two villagers, one of whom was seriously wounded. Nearby rice fields and a house were damaged.
    On the evening of the same day, four US-South Vietnamese helicopters intruded over the provincial defense force posts of Batu village, Traeng village, and Kode village, firing flares and strafing these locations.
    According to reports, on December 10th of last year, ten fully armed South Vietnamese armed personnel intruded approximately 500 meters into Cambodian territory in Svay Rieng province.
    On December 19th, more than 50 South Vietnamese armed personnel invaded the area of Tu Ta Dao in Takeo province but were driven back across the Cambodian border by the Cambodian provincial defense forces and armed villagers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 2nd - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 2nd, the United States has recently expanded the "Free Khmer" forces in South Vietnam in preparation for invading Cambodia.
    According to reports, on December 24th of last year, five soldiers from the Loc Ninh post in South Vietnam, not far from the Cambodian border (including two soldiers of Khmer descent), carrying three carbines and two revolvers, patrolled along the Cambodian border, and they also spoke with the guards at the Cambodian post.
    One of the Khmer-descent soldiers stated that there were twenty soldiers at their post in Loc Ninh, seventeen of whom were South Vietnamese, three of whom were South Vietnamese of Khmer descent, and five additional intelligence personnel.
    This soldier said: Currently, Son Ngoc Thanh (note: Cambodian traitor, head of the "Free Khmer") is actively promoting the so-called "liberation of Cambodia" in various parts of South Vietnam; Son Ngoc Thanh visited the Loc Ninh post twice last year.
    These South Vietnamese soldiers also said that most of the "Free Khmer" soldiers in South Vietnam are Khmer-descent people in South Vietnam, but there are also South Vietnamese; the military pay and supplies are provided by the United States.
    The strength of the "Free Khmer" forces was previously estimated to be three thousand men, and the Saigon regime recently added two thousand men. They are directly commanded by Son Ngoc Thanh and the Americans.

    柬新社揭露美国阴谋利用“自由高棉”匪帮侵入柬埔寨
    新华社金边二日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二日报道：美国—南越军队在去年十二月多次侵入柬埔寨境内，并且派飞机轰炸和扫射了一些村庄。柬埔寨军队击退了他们的入侵。
    美国—南越军队的两架直升飞机于十二月三十一日六点多钟侵入柬埔寨领空，多次飞越柴桢省巴图村的省防军哨所上空，随后，又有大约五十架飞机把部队运到边境线附近。
    同一天，九点多钟，另一批南越武装部队的人员又侵入巴图村柬埔寨境内深达约一公里的地方。不久，被柬埔寨国防军击退。
    同时，美国—南越军队的三架空中袭击者式飞机又多次飞越巴图村的省防军哨所上空，在柬埔寨境内深达约六百米的地方投下三颗凝固汽油弹，炸伤两个村民，其中一人受了重伤。破坏了附近的稻田和一所房屋。
    同一天傍晚，美国—南越军队的四架直升飞机侵入巴图村、特诺村和科德村的省防军哨所上空，发射了照明弹，并且扫射了这些地方。
    据报道，去年十二月十日，全副武装的南越武装部队人员十人侵入柬埔寨柴桢省境内深达约五百米的地方。
    十二月十九日，还有南越武装部队人员五十多人侵入茶胶省杜塔道地方，被柬埔寨省防军和武装村民击退到柬埔寨境外。
    新华社金边二日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二日报道，美国最近在南越扩充“自由高棉”部队，准备侵犯柬埔寨。
    据报道，去年十二月二十四日，离柬埔寨边境不远的南越禄清哨所的五名士兵（包括两名高棉血统的士兵），拿着三支卡宾枪和两支左轮枪沿着柬埔寨边境巡逻，他们还同柬埔寨哨所的守卫谈话。
    这五个人中的一个高棉血统的士兵说，他们在禄清的哨所有二十个士兵，其中有十七个是南越人，三个是南越的高棉血统人，另外还有五个情报人员。
    这个士兵说：目前山玉成（按：柬埔寨叛国分子，“自由高棉”的头子）在南越各地积极宣传所谓“解放柬埔寨”；山玉成去年曾经两次来到禄清哨所。
    这些南越士兵还说，在南越的“自由高棉”士兵大部分是在南越的高棉血统人，也有南越人；军饷和物资都是由美国供应的。
      “自由高棉”部队的兵力过去估计有三千人，西贡政权新近补充了两千人。他们由山玉成和美国人直接指挥。
