    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 21st, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force have recently held joint celebrations with local Party committees, government organs, and people of all ethnic groups to celebrate the Spring Festival. At the celebrations, military and civilians expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen unity, and make new contributions to socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    Before the Spring Festival, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces and autonomous regions held grand military-civilian get-togethers. Ulanhu, Lin Tie, Ouyang Qin, Wang Enmao, Jiang Weiqing, Tan Qilong, Zhang Pinghua and other responsible persons of the provinces (regions) and military leaders participated in the get-togethers respectively, and received representatives of "Four Good" companies, "Five Good" soldiers, combat heroes, families of martyrs and soldiers, outstanding militiamen, and labor models and advanced workers from various fronts such as industry, agriculture, culture and education who attended the get-togethers.
    Along the thousands of miles of coastline, military-civilian celebrations have continued incessantly in recent days. PLA commanders and fighters and local people, who have forged a deep friendship in the struggle against the enemy, celebrated the victories of the past year with joy at the forefront, on islands, and deep in coconut groves, expressing their determination for the future. A certain artillery regiment of the Fujian Front, which had won meritorious service in the battle against the Chiang Kai-shek army's artillery shelling, held a grand worker-peasant-soldier get-together with factories and farms near their garrison before the Spring Festival. Military and civilians spoke freely about the significant achievements made in the struggle against the enemy and in industrial and agricultural production under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Military and civilians repeatedly expressed their determination to further strengthen unity, better defend the eastern gate of the motherland, and strive for greater achievements in the struggle against the enemy and in the struggle for production. In a certain outpost in the South China Sea, commanders and fighters of a naval unit also held a get-together with local fishermen, workers, and students. The sailors performed literary and artistic programs such as "Ode to Heroes" and "Night Annihilation of Enemy Ships," praising steel sailor Mai Xiande and others, inspiring the revolutionary spirit of the people to dare to struggle and dare to win.
    In the border areas of the motherland, garrison commanders and fighters held joint celebrations with various fraternal ethnic groups, talking freely about the profound friendship between the army and the people and jointly expressing their determination to defend the border.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 21st, during the joyous traditional Spring Festival, the homes of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers across the country are particularly festive. People beat gongs and drums to express warm condolences to them, and conveyed the deep concern of the Party, the government, and the people of the whole country. The families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers are also full of lofty aspirations. They expressed their determination to better study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, continuously improve their ideological awareness, continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, strive for greater glory, and repay the care of the Party and the government with practical actions.
    In many places, leading cadres of the Party, government, and garrison led teams to express their condolences to them.
    The old revolutionary base areas are even more festive. In Jinggangshan, the cradle of the revolution, cadres from the Jinggangshan Administration Bureau and local garrison troops went to the Ciping Home for Honored Elderly today to wish the revolutionary veterans a happy holiday. People in the old revolutionary base area of western Fujian also congratulated the families of martyrs and soldiers from door to door and held forums to solicit their opinions on preferential treatment work.
    In the homes of many famous revolutionary martyrs, there has been a constant stream of people visiting to express their condolences in recent days. People from the Jiguang Commune in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, visited the mother of martyr Huang Jiguang. On the 20th, Huang's mother was invited to the Zhongjiang County Party Committee and the County People's Committee to celebrate the festival.

    在千里海防线上，连日来，军民联欢活动持续不断。对敌斗争中结成了深厚友谊的解放军指战员和驻地群众，纷纷在前沿阵地、在海岛上、在椰林深处，喜气洋洋地祝贺过去一年的胜利，表示今后的决心。曾经在严惩蒋军炮战中荣立战功的福建前线炮兵某团，春节前夕同驻地附近的工厂、农场举行了工农兵大联欢，军民畅谈在党和毛主席的领导下，在对敌斗争和工农业生产中取得的重大成就。军民一再表示要进一步加强团结，更好地保卫祖国的东大门，在对敌斗争和生产斗争中争取更大成绩。在南海前哨某地，海军某部指战员也和驻地渔民、工人、学生举行联欢会，水兵们演出了歌颂钢铁水兵麦贤得等的文艺节目《英雄赞歌》、《夜歼敌舰》，鼓舞了人民群众敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。
    在祖国的边疆，驻军指战员同各兄弟民族纷纷举行联欢活动，畅谈军民鱼水之情，共表同守边疆的决心。
    据新华社二十一日讯  在欢度传统新春佳节的时候，各地烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员退伍军人的家里显得份外喜气洋洋。人们敲锣打鼓前来向他们表示热烈慰问，并且转达了党、政府和全国人民对他们的深切关怀。烈属、军属、残废军人和复员退伍军人们也满怀豪情壮志，他们纷纷表示，今后一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，不断提高思想觉悟，继续发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣，以实际行动来答谢党和政府的关怀。
    许多地方都由党、政府和驻军的领导干部带队前往，向他们表示慰问。
    各个革命老根据地更是一番节日景象。在革命摇篮井冈山，井冈山管理局的干部和当地驻军今天都到茨坪光荣敬老院去向革命老人贺节。闽西革命老根据地的人们也挨家挨户地向烈、军属祝贺节日，并召开座谈会征求了他们对优抚工作的意见。
