    (Xinhua News Agency) The East China Sea brings good news of a bumper harvest of hairtail during the winter fishing season. During the peak season for hairtail, more than 15,000 fishing boats from the five provinces and cities of Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Guangdong are taking advantage of the favorable conditions to cast their nets day and night. As of December 11, the fishing ground had caught more than 117,000 tons of hairtail, more than the same period in 1964.

    Through the socialist education movement, the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of fishermen has been raised, and they have actively carried out the movement of learning from Dazhai and catching up with Dazhai. Inspired by the Dazhai spirit, the fishermen participating in the winter fishing production have carried forward the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to fight the sea, not fearing the cold, casting their nets day and night, and striving for high and stable yields for their boats. The fleet of the Dongsheng Brigade of the Guantou Commune in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, an advanced unit of Dazhai-style fishery, is fishing in the Shengshan fishing ground. A fishing brigade from Longhai County, which was fishing with them, used motorized sailing boats for fishing for the first time last year. The members of Dongsheng took the initiative to teach them how to observe the water color, analyze the fish situation, and pass on the net-casting technology, and took them to catch hairtail at night, achieving high yields together.

    Bringing Chairman Mao's works on board, bringing political work on board, bringing leading cadres on board, and bringing scientific and technical personnel on board are prominent features of winter fishing production. Many fishing boats have Chairman Mao's quotations plaques hanging on them, and the fishermen carry Chairman Mao's works with them. They study when returning to port to avoid the wind, and they also seize the gaps to study when going out to sea to fish. In order to better guide fishermen in studying Chairman Mao's works and strengthen ideological and political work, many ships are equipped with political instructors and study tutors. The Party organization of the fishing ground also uses newspapers and radio to publicize advanced experiences and good people and good deeds, and to establish advanced role models among the fishermen. More leading cadres are also going out to sea with the ships than in previous years. Commercial, industrial, handicraft, meteorological, and health departments in coastal areas have also adopted various methods to serve the fishing season production.

    嵊山渔场带鱼丰收
    据新华社讯　东海上传来了冬季捕带鱼获丰收的喜讯。在带鱼旺发的季节，前来嵊山渔场捕鱼的浙江、上海、江苏、福建和广东五个省市的一万五千多条渔船，正乘大好时机日夜下网捕鱼。到十二月十一日为止，这个渔场捕获的带鱼已达十一万七千多吨，比一九六四年同期多。
    经过社会主义教育运动，广大渔民的政治思想觉悟提高，积极开展学大寨、赶大寨的比学赶帮超运动。在大寨精神鼓舞下，参加冬汛生产的渔民们，发扬“愚公移山”的精神向大海斗争，不怕寒冷，日夜下网捕鱼，争取船只高产稳产。福建省大寨式渔业先进单位连江县琯头公社东升大队的船队正在嵊山渔场上捕鱼。同他们一起捕鱼的龙海县的一个渔业大队，去年是第一次用机帆船捕鱼。东升的社员们就主动教他们看水色，分析鱼情，传授下网技术，带他们一起乘夜捕带鱼，双双获得了高产。
    毛主席著作上船，政治工作上船，领导干部上船，科学技术人员上船，是冬汛生产中一个突出的特点。许多渔船上挂着毛主席语录牌，渔民随身带着毛主席著作。他们在回港避风时学习，出海捕鱼时也抓紧空隙学习。为了更好辅导渔民学习毛主席著作，加强思想政治工作，许多船上都设有政治指导员，学习辅导员。渔场的党组织还利用报纸和广播，宣传先进经验和好人好事，在渔民中树立先进榜样。随船出海的领导干部也比往年多。沿海地区的商业、工业、手工业、气象和卫生等部门，也采取多种办法，为渔汛生产服务。
