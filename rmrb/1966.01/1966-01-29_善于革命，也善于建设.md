　　Good at Revolution, Also Good at Construction
　　In the autumn of 1948, the People's Liberation Army launched a full-scale counter-offensive and occupied many industrial cities and mines. At that time, the urgent task facing the Party and the people was how to restore industrial production faster and better to meet the needs of the Liberation War and the people in the liberated areas.
　　The novel "Boiling Mountains" takes a mine in southern Liaoning as its background and describes a series of struggles undertaken by the mine's people under the leadership of the Party to restore production on a ruin. It focuses on the sharp struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the industrial front. According to the bourgeois view, the restoration of production in this mine must rely on foreign equipment and funds, and it will take at least ten years. However, the Party leadership of the mine carried forward the fine traditions of our Party and our army, adhered to the policy of striving for self-reliance and self-reliance, followed the mass line, and finally overcame numerous obstacles and restored production in less than a year. The mine was boiling!
　　The novel embodies the truth stated by Chairman Mao: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world." It reflects the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought's red flag on China's industrial front.

    善于革命，也善于建设
    一九四八年秋，人民解放军全面反攻，占领了许多工业城市和矿山。当时摆在党和人民面前的紧急任务，是如何更快更好地恢复工业生产，满足解放战争和解放区人民的需要。
    《沸腾的群山》这部小说，以辽南的一个矿山为背景，描写了党领导下的矿山人民，在一片废墟上，为恢复生产所进行的一系列的斗争，着重地表现了在工业战线上无产阶级和资产阶级两条道路的尖锐斗争。按照资产阶级的观点，这座矿山要恢复生产，必须借助于外国的器材和资金，而且至少需要十年之久。但矿山党的领导，发扬了我党我军的优良传统，坚持奋发图强、自力更生的方针，走群众路线，终于克服了重重障碍，不到一年就恢复了生产。矿山沸腾起来了！
    小说体现了毛主席所说的真理：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”。反映了毛泽东思想红旗在我国工业战线上的伟大胜利。
