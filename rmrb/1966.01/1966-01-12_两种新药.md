    Two New Drugs
    "Dimercaptosuccinic Acid Sodium" a new drug developed through the collaborative research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Materia Medica and relevant departments for treating various metal poisonings, and "Sodium Stibocaptate" (i.e., Antimony-58), a new drug for treating schistosomiasis japonica, have been proven effective after years of laboratory research and clinical trials.

    Antimony agents are generally used to treat schistosomiasis japonica, but some patients experience poisoning during the treatment process. In order to alleviate antimony poisoning, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Materia Medica began researching and searching for new antidotes in 1954. They synthesized a series of compounds, and after repeated animal testing and screening, they found "Dimercaptosuccinic Acid Sodium," a metal antidote with a broad spectrum of action. Trial use has proven that it has significant detoxification effects on more than ten types of metal poisoning, including antimony, mercury, lead, and arsenic. Currently, there are very few types of metal antidotes available in the world, and they often only have efficacy against certain types of metal poisoning. The successful research of "Dimercaptosuccinic Acid Sodium" is not only valuable for the treatment of schistosomiasis but also significant for treating metal poisoning in industrial production and safeguarding the health of the working people.

    The main drug currently used in our country to treat schistosomiasis japonica is tartar emetic, which can only be administered intravenously. Intravenous injections are difficult for children and livestock, making it inconvenient to use. The outstanding advantage of the new drug "Sodium Stibocaptate," researched and synthesized by the Institute of Materia Medica, is that it can be administered intramuscularly, and even subcutaneously for draft animals. Clinical trials on more than 1,800 patients with schistosomiasis japonica have proven that the efficacy of "Sodium Stibocaptate" is similar to that of tartar emetic, but the method of use is much simpler than tartar emetic.

    两种新药
    中国科学院药物研究所和有关部门协作研究成功的可治疗多种金属中毒的新药“二巯丁二钠”和治疗日本血吸虫病的新药“巯锑钠”（即锑—58），经多年实验室研究和临床试用，证明疗效良好。
    治疗日本血吸虫病一般使用锑剂，但在治疗过程中个别病人会发生中毒现象。中国科学院药物研究所为了解救锑中毒，从一九五四年开始研究寻找新的解毒药。他们合成了一系列化合物，经过多次动物试验筛选，从中找到了“二巯丁二钠”这种作用范围较广的金属解毒剂。试用证明，它对锑、汞、铅、砷等十多种金属中毒都有明显的解毒作用。目前世界上已有的金属解毒药品种很少，而且往往只对某几种金属中毒有疗效。“二巯丁二钠”的研究成功，不仅对治疗血吸虫病有价值，对治疗工业生产中金属中毒，保障劳动人民的健康也有重要意义。
    目前我国治疗日本血吸虫病的主要药物是吐酒石，这种药只能作静脉注射，对儿童和牲畜进行静脉注射比较困难，使用不便。药物研究所研究合成的新药“巯锑钠”的突出优点是既可以作肌内注射，对耕畜还可作皮下注射。对一千八百多例日本血吸虫病人进行了临床试验，都证明“巯锑钠”的疗效同吐酒石相似，而使用方法却比吐酒石简便得多。
