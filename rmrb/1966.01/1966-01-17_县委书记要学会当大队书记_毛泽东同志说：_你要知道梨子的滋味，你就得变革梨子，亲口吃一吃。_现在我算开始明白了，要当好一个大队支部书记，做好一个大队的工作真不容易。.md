    County Party Secretary Must Learn to Be a Brigade Party Secretary
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself." Now I finally understand, it's really not easy to be a good brigade branch secretary and do a good job in a brigade.
    Last July, I and several comrades from the County Party Committee Office went to Dongjia Brigade in Guanzhuang Commune to stay and work. During these three months, I participated in some labor with the brigade secretary and did some investigation and research work. Through this practice, I think that to be a good county party secretary, you must learn to be a good brigade party secretary.
    When we first arrived at Dongjia Brigade, it was the beginning of the rural summer harvest and summer planting. At this time, we were harvesting and planting at the same time, and we also had to change the intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice. Time was short, manpower was limited, and the task was intense. Changing intercropping to continuous cropping is an effective measure to increase production in Leping to achieve a bumper late rice harvest. To change to continuous cropping, we must reform the tools and universally promote the use of stone rollers to reduce manpower and save time. This method has been fully mastered in the high-yielding rice areas of Taqian and Shuangtian in our county. I thought there wouldn't be any problems in deploying it! However, the production teams in Dongjia Brigade all reported that the stone rollers could not break the soil. It couldn't be used. Strange! Why did it fail in Dongjia? If it were as usual, I would at least accuse the brigade secretary of having "conservative ideas," "resistant emotions," or criticize them for not knowing how to work. Now, I myself am staying in this brigade, and of course I can't just point fingers when I encounter problems. After investigation, it turned out that Dongjia Brigade was a place with more fields and less labor. In order to speed up the harvest and planting time, the commune members were accustomed to draining the water to harvest the rice, and the field was relatively hard, making it difficult for the stone roller to penetrate the soil. It seems that not all fields can use stone rollers with a single call. Starting from this reality, I went to the Second Production Team to study the method of use with several commune members, adapting to local conditions. The commune members all said that the stone rollers were easy to use. We promptly introduced the methods from the pilot point to the general area, from point to area, and promoted it. This practical work test made me begin to understand the importance of staying and working at the grassroots level, and also began to realize that it is not easy to do a good job in a brigade and be a good brigade secretary.
    Before the late rice was finished being planted, we found that the late rice pest damage was very serious. The newly planted seedlings turned yellow in large quantities after being damaged. Has this situation occurred in previous years? Yes, but it was not discovered. It was always thought that the yellowing of rice seedlings was a normal thing. After finding the reason this time, we studied with the brigade cadres and used the method of fighting annihilation battles. After several consecutive treatments, the pests were stopped, and the rice seedlings quickly turned green. In the past, it was always thought that after the late rice planting was completed, it was a relatively idle season for agricultural activities. The tasks of various departments and units were piled up, the phone calls became more frequent, the meetings came, and the reports increased, creating a situation of "endless reports coming down, endless meetings rolling in, and phone bells ringing tightly." In this case, the brigade secretary was bound to be surrounded and could only abandon rural work to "serve" the reports and be busy with meetings. Indeed, with this practice, my understanding of brigade work has deepened a step further.
    During the three months of staying and working at the grassroots level, I understood Comrade Mao Zedong's sentence: "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself." Now I finally understand that it is not easy to be a good brigade secretary and do a good job in a brigade. A brigade actually undertakes all the tasks and plans of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. The brigade secretary plays a role in linking the top and the bottom. The tasks from various departments and units above will eventually converge on the brigade secretary, and then be implemented one by one through the brigade. At the same time, the brigade branch secretary must also participate in labor, manage the lives of the commune members, and sometimes do some housework. From all directions, with a thousand things to attend to, the burden is really heavy. The tasks of various departments and units above are like gurgling water sources, and the brigade is like a reservoir. These water sources will eventually flow into the reservoir. The brigade secretary is like a reservoir gate, which he must open and close to deliver water to the fields. If the water勢 above does not consider the reservoir capacity and comes too large and too fierce, the reservoir will not be able to accommodate it, and the gate will not be able to discharge it, there is a risk of overflowing the dam. If the water勢 is gentle, the reservoir can swallow and spit, and the gate can discharge smoothly, then it can nourish thousands of acres of fertile land.
    The tasks of the brigade are so heavy, and the brigade secretary bears such a heavy responsibility. From this point of view, I feel that to be a good county party secretary, you must first learn to be a brigade secretary. Go to the brigade to stay and work, to labor, and to work. Go deep into the grassroots level and understand the real situation. In this way, on the one hand, we can accumulate practical work experience and improve our leadership level. On the other hand, after a period of practical work, we can put ourselves in the place of others, understand the people below, start from reality, liberate ourselves from the philosophy of trivialities, come up with good ideas, and hit the drum in the middle.
    The company of the People's Liberation Army is a combat unit. The People's Liberation Army attaches great importance to company work, and company work is carried out vigorously. In the countryside, the brigade is the company of the countryside. If the leadership of the county party committee wants to be truly revolutionized, it should learn from the People's Liberation Army, strengthen company work, go to the company to be both a commander and an ordinary soldier, so that thousands of companies in the countryside can truly play a combat role. I think if we can do these things, then the county party secretary will have done a good job.

    县委书记要学会当大队书记
    毛泽东同志说：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”现在我算开始明白了，要当好一个大队支部书记，做好一个大队的工作真不容易。
    去年七月，我同县委办公室几位同志到官庄公社董家大队蹲点。在这三个月当中，同大队书记在一块参加了一些劳动，做了一些调查研究工作。通过这段实践，我想，要做好一个县委书记，就要学会当好一个大队书记。
    当我们刚到董家大队的时候，正值农村夏收夏种开始，这时又收又种，还要把间作稻改为连作稻。时间短促，人力有限，任务紧张。间作改连作，是乐平夺取晚稻丰收的一项有效增产措施。要改连作必须实行工具改革，普遍推广碌碡，才能减少人力，争取时间。这个办法在我县塔前、双田等水稻丰产地区已经完全掌握了。我认为布置下去该没有什么问题了吧！可是董家大队各生产队都反映碌碡打不烂田土。不能用。奇怪！为什么偏偏在董家就行不通。要是象往常一样，起码要指责这个大队书记有“保守思想”、“抵触情绪”，或者批评他们不会做工作。现在，我自己蹲在这个大队，碰到问题当然不能指手划脚了。经过调查，原来董家大队是一个田多劳少的地方，社员为加快收种时间，习惯放干水割禾，田板比较硬，碌碡不容易扎进土层。看来并不是所有的田在一声号召下都可以使用碌碡。从这个实际出发，我便到第二生产队同几个社员研究使用方法，因田制宜，社员都说碌碡听使唤了。我们及时把点上的办法向面上介绍，由点到面，推而广之。这次实际工作的考验，使我开始懂得了蹲点的重要，也开始体会到要做好一个大队的工作，当好一个大队书记并非一件易事。
    晚稻还没有栽完，我们又发现晚稻虫害十分严重，刚栽下的禾苗受害后大量卷黄。这种情况往年有没有呢？有，但没有被发现，总认为禾苗返黄是一件正常的事。这次找到了原因以后，我们同大队干部一起研究，运用打歼灭战的办法，连续治了几次，才把害虫止住，禾苗很快返青。要是在过去，总认为晚稻栽插完毕，正是农事活动比较空闲的季节。各个部门各个单位的任务就堆下来了，电话声也勤了，会议也来了，报表也多了，大有“无边报表纷纷下，不尽会议滚滚来，电话铃声紧紧催”之势。在这种情况下大队书记就势必被团团围困了，只好丢开农村工作，去为报表“服务”，为会议忙碌。的确，有了这次实践，我对大队工作的认识深入了一步。
    三个月的蹲点，我理解了毛泽东同志这一句话：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”现在我算开始明白了，要当好一个大队书记，做好一个大队的工作真不容易。一个大队实际担负着工农商学兵、农林牧副渔的一切任务和一切计划。大队书记要起承上启下作用，上面条条块块的任务，最后要汇集到大队书记身上，然后通过大队这一关，一项一项往下贯彻实行。同时大队支部书记还要参加劳动，还要管一管社员的生活，有时还得做一点家务事。四面八方，千头万绪，担子实在是很重的。上面各个部门和各个单位的任务，好象是汩汩不息的水头，大队好象是一个水库，这些水头最终都要流进水库。而大队书记就如同水库闸门一样，他要开关启闭，把水输送到田野里去。如果上面水势不根据水库容量，来的过大过猛，水库就容纳不下，闸门也排泄不了，就有漫坝覆顶的危险。水势缓和，水库能吞能吐，闸门排泄畅通，才能滋润万顷良田。
    大队工作任务如此繁重，大队书记身负如此大的重任，从这点出发，我就觉得要做好一个县委书记，先要学会当个大队书记。到大队去蹲点，去劳动，去工作。深入下层，了解实情。这样一方面可以积累实际工作的经验，提高领导水平，另一方面经过一段时间的实际工作，我们就能推己及人，体谅下面，从实际出发，把我们自己从烦琐的哲学中解放出来，出些好点子，把鼓槌打到鼓中间。
    解放军的连队是一个战斗单位，解放军很重视连队工作，连队工作搞的生龙活虎。在农村大队就是农村的连队。县委领导要真正革命化，就应当大学解放军，加强连队工作，到连队中去既当一个指挥官又当一个普通的兵，使农村千千万万个连队真正发挥战斗作用。我看要做到这些，那么县委书记就算做好了。
