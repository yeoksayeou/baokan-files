    Editor's Note: The past year was one of intense struggle between the people of Latin America and US imperialism and its running dogs, and also a year of in-depth development of the national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin America. The world is undergoing a process of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization, and Latin America is certainly no exception. In the struggle between the mainstream and the countercurrent, there will be twists and turns. The revolutions of the peoples of various countries cannot but develop forward in a wave-like manner. The national liberation struggle in Latin America is bound to be the same. However, the general trend in Latin America is more favorable to the peoples of Latin American countries and more unfavorable to US imperialism. The historical trend that the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world must be liberated is irresistible.
    In 1965, 200 million Latin American people waged a more intense and extensive struggle against the most ferocious imperialism in the world—US imperialism. The Johnson administration's brutal suppression of the Dominican people educated all Latin Americans. The Latin American people, who have suffered the slavery and exploitation of American monopoly capital, are marching forward in a new awakening. Pro-American dictatorial rule has become more isolated and unstable. The crisis of American rule in the region has deepened as never before.
  The Dominican People Deflated American Imperialism's Arrogance
    The magnificent anti-American patriotic armed struggle of the Dominican people, which broke out last April, is another example of the irreconcilable contradiction between the people of Latin American countries and US imperialism. Although the United States, relying on its military force, sent more than 30,000 troops, more than 300 aircraft, and more than 40 warships to this small country with a population of just over three million to carry out direct and frantic suppression, killing nearly 10,000 Dominicans, the Dominican patriots did not succumb to American pressure. Their heroic struggle against the American military occupation and demanding the withdrawal of the American aggressor troops is still developing wave after wave.
    The Dominican struggle boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of Latin America and deflated the arrogance of US imperialism. The storm of protests and anger throughout Latin America and the world, triggered by the American armed intervention, still lingers in the minds of the American ruling clique. More importantly, the united hatred caused by this bloody intervention is further mobilizing the Latin American people to wage a resolute struggle against US imperialism, which is rampant everywhere.
    The need to fight back with a tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye, and to resist counter-revolutionary violence with revolutionary violence is a valuable lesson learned by the Latin American people after shedding a lot of blood. Today, the idea of armed struggle is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. In many countries where armed struggle already exists, such as Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala, the struggle is continuing, and in some countries there is new development. In other countries, the flames of new armed struggles have also been ignited, which is one of the important characteristics of the national democratic revolutionary struggle in Latin American countries in 1965.
    A new people's revolutionary armed force in Peru was established last June. It was established after the armed uprising of the Dominican people and the US action to send large troops to suppress the Dominican Republic. This fact shows that the Latin American people cannot be intimidated or conquered. The United States tried its best to strangle this armed force in its infancy, but the Peruvian guerrillas are still active in the Andes Mountains.
    In Colombia, which US imperialism regards as a testing ground for "special warfare" in Latin America, the guerrillas have opened up a new guerrilla front after continuously resisting countless "encirclements and suppressions" by government troops commanded by American "advisors." The conditions of the struggle are very difficult, but the guerrillas are full of fighting spirit.
    Venezuelan guerrillas have also been subjected to continuous "encirclements and suppressions" by reactionary troops commanded by American "advisors." At present, the guerrillas who persist in the battle are still carrying out struggles in the west, central, and eastern parts of the country.
    In Brazil, armed struggle first broke out in March last year. A group of patriotic soldiers took up arms in the southern part of the country to resist the pro-American dictatorial regime. Although this group of pioneers failed, their heroic initiative will inevitably produce positive results.
  Anti-American and Anti-Dictatorial Struggles Continue to Surge
    Corresponding to the armed struggle is the continued advance of the struggle by people from all walks of life in various countries against American aggression, against the dictatorial rule imposed by the United States, against American economic plunder, and demanding improved working and living conditions. This is another important feature of the political situation in Latin America in 1965. The people of all countries were mobilized under the slogan of "No Interference in the Dominican Republic," and from Mexico to Argentina, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate, and more than 120 mass organizations issued statements, strongly opposing the new crimes of American aggression. In Bolivia, where the Johnson government instigated the establishment of a pro-American dictatorial rule, immediately after the Dominican people's uprising, more than 30,000 tin miners in seventeen mining areas across the country launched large-scale demonstrations and an indefinite general strike in May last year, starting from opposing the American conspiracy to cancel the "Mining Industry Restructuring Plan" for the nationalization of Bolivia. The workers took up arms, occupied major mining areas such as Catavi, and launched a heroic battle for more than ten days with thousands of government troops who invaded the mining areas to suppress them.
    The Panamanian people are persisting in their struggle against the American occupation of Panamanian territory. Seventy-five thousand workers and students held demonstrations in January last year to once again express their determination to fight for national independence. The Peruvian people's movement against the American International Petroleum Company's continued occupation of Peruvian oil fields lasted for more than three months from February last year and spread to several provinces. Chilean copper miners marched on the capital to oppose the plunder by American copper companies, shouting: "Miners, be firm, hit the Americans hard!" "Be vigilant, Chileans, the Americans are at the door!" In Ecuador, despite the dictatorial authorities' prohibition of all demonstrations, tens of thousands of workers, students, and citizens repeatedly held marches, demonstrations, and strikes in February, May, and July last year to protest against American interference in internal affairs and demand an end to dictatorial rule. Even in Brazil, where the United States instigated far-right soldiers to establish fascist rule, the people were not intimidated by violence and took many anti-American actions. Brazilian patriots held an anti-dictatorship demonstration in front of the venue of the special meeting of the Pan American Foreign Ministers in November last year, which was another heavy blow to the Johnson government.
    Waves of strikes rose one after another. Participants included workers, agricultural laborers, teachers, civil servants, medical workers, and other working people. Taking Uruguay as an example, this country had experienced about 650 strikes from the beginning of last year to October. These strikes were directly or indirectly related to opposing the exploitative policies of American monopoly capital.
  Anti-American United Front is Forming and Expanding
    Another feature of the political situation in Latin America in 1965 is that in the sharp and intense national democratic revolutionary tide, various political forces are undergoing a profound reorganization and division. Revolutionary forces are constantly expanding and strengthening. A broad anti-American national united front is gradually forming and expanding throughout Latin America.
    In the past year, many new parties and organizations that adhere to revolutionary principles and revolutionary practice have emerged. The traditional parties in some countries have become more divided, giving rise to many new political parties and factional organizations, which means that more and more people have seen through the reactionary essence of the traditional parties. Because the United States blatantly colludes with right-wing forces to implement reactionary rule locally, a large number of middle-of-the-roaders have increasingly taken open anti-American stances to varying degrees. Pro-American right-wing forces are becoming increasingly isolated and despised by the people. Taking the Branco regime in Brazil as an example, this regime held facade gubernatorial elections in eleven states in the country in October last year, and as a result, the opposition gained the advantage and a large number of official candidates were defeated. Even American bourgeois newspapers are worriedly talking about the Branco regime's bad days are coming.
    In contrast to the formation of the magnificent anti-American united front, the crisis of American rule in the region has intensified as never before in the past year. Johnson's policy of military stick and political control is becoming increasingly ineffective for Latin American countries. The United States has encountered open opposition not only from all the Latin American people but also from some factions in power and some ruling forces in many countries in its "backyard," which is another very meaningful feature of the political situation in Latin America in 1965.
  Johnson's Big Stick Policy is Increasingly Ineffective
    The American invasion of the Dominican Republic was openly condemned by the heads of state of six countries and the parliaments of seven countries. The United States put a "Pan American" coat on its troops invading the Dominican Republic, but with the exception of Brazil, no influential Latin American government was willing to provide troops to act as American accomplices. Under the lead of countries such as Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay, the American plan to establish a standing Western Hemisphere suppression force was shelved at the special meeting of Pan American Foreign Ministers in November. Western newspapers pointed out that this meeting revealed that the "vitality" of the Pan American system "has currently reached its lowest point."
    It is worth pointing out that this situation, which is extremely unfavorable to the United States within the "Pan American system," has begun to manifest itself in its external relations. When the previous UN General Assembly voted on the proposal to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China and the so-called "Tibetan issue" proposed by the United States to incite anti-China sentiment, three and two Latin American countries respectively deviated from the United States and abstained. American newspapers exclaimed that this was an "unprecedented action." This action is an open challenge to American hegemony by Latin American countries.
    In the economic field, accumulated grievances against American monopoly capital have repeatedly erupted into unprecedented collective protests. In the second half of last year, sixteen sugar-producing countries and eleven cotton-producing countries successively lodged joint protests against the Johnson government's legislation to increase sugar import taxes and dump cotton. At the end of 1965, the Mexican Congress passed a bill proposed by the government to strictly prohibit foreign capital from infiltrating Mexico's financial sector. Needless to say, this measure is an even more representative blow to the United States.
    Facts over the past year have shown that the so-called hard-line "Johnson Doctrine" implemented by the United States after the bankruptcy of the "Alliance for Progress" has not only failed to help the United States control the anti-American struggle on this continent, but has greatly accelerated the revolutionary process here. The flames of struggle have been ignited everywhere, and an explosive situation of volcanic lava about to erupt has emerged. American newspapers have had to admit that "from one end of Latin America to the other, the current situation is becoming increasingly tense." "Danger is gathering" at the doorstep of the United States, and there is no "effective solution" to be found at all. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached pictures)

### 拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动在深入发展  美帝国主义统治危机空前加深美报承认找不到有效解决办法

    拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动在深入发展
    美帝国主义统治危机空前加深美报承认找不到有效解决办法
    编者按：过去一年是拉丁美洲人民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行激烈搏斗的一年，也是拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动深入发展的一年。全世界正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程，拉丁美洲当然也不例外。在主流和逆流的斗争中，会有曲折和反复。各国人民的革命不能不是波浪式地向前发展。拉丁美洲的民族解放斗争也必然是这样。但是，拉丁美洲形势的总趋势是更有利于拉丁美洲各国人民，而更加不利于美帝国主义。全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族一定要解放的历史潮流是不可抗拒的。
    一九六五年，两亿拉丁美洲人民对世界上最凶恶的帝国主义——美帝国主义进行了更加激烈、更加广泛的斗争。约翰逊政府对多米尼加人民的残酷镇压教育了全拉丁美洲人。受尽美国垄断资本奴役和压榨的拉丁美洲人民在新的觉醒中向前迈进。亲美独裁统治更加孤立不稳。美国在这个地区的统治危机已空前加深。
  多米尼加人民灭了美帝威风
    去年四月爆发的多米尼加人民气壮山河的反美爱国武装斗争，是拉丁美洲各国人民和美帝国主义之间矛盾不可调和的又一例证。尽管美国依仗它的武力，对这个人口只有三百多万的小国派出三万多军队、三百多架飞机、四十多艘军舰去进行直接的疯狂镇压，屠杀了将近一万名多米尼加人，但是，多米尼加爱国者并没有在美国的压力下屈服。他们反对美国军事占领，要美国侵略军滚出去的英勇斗争仍在一浪接一浪地向前发展。
    多米尼加的斗争长了拉丁美洲革命人民的志气，灭了美帝国主义的威风。美国的武装干涉激起的全拉丁美洲和全世界的暴风雨般的抗议怒潮，使美国统治集团到现在还心有余悸。而更加重要的是，这次血腥干涉事件所引起的同仇敌忾，正在进一步动员拉丁美洲人民向到处横行的美帝国主义作坚决斗争。
    需要以牙还牙、以眼还眼，用革命的暴力反抗反革命的暴力，这是拉丁美洲人民在流洒大量鲜血以后得出的一条宝贵经验。今天，武装斗争的思想正深入人心。在不少已经存在武装斗争的国家，如哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉、危地马拉等国，斗争在坚持着，而且在有些国家有新发展。在另外一些国家，新的武装斗争的烈火也燃烧开来了，这是一九六五年拉丁美洲各国民族民主革命斗争的重要特点之一。
    秘鲁的一支新的人民革命武装是在去年六月建立起来的。它建立在多米尼加人民发生武装起义、美国采取出动大军镇压多米尼加的行动之后。这一事实说明，拉丁美洲人民是既吓不倒也征服不了的。美国竭力企图把这支武装扼杀在它的萌芽时期，但是秘鲁的游击队仍然活跃在安第斯山区。
    在被美帝国主义当作拉丁美洲“特种战争”试验场的哥伦比亚，游击队在连续抗击了由美国
  “顾问”指挥的政府军的无数次“围剿”以后，又开辟了一条新的游击战线。斗争的条件很困难，但是游击战士的斗志十分昂扬。
    委内瑞拉的游击战士也遭到美国“顾问”指挥下的反动军队的连续“围剿”。目前，坚持战斗的游击队仍在这个国家的西部、中部和东部开展斗争。
    在巴西，在去年三月第一次爆发了武装斗争。一批爱国军人在这个国家的南部地区拿起武器反抗亲美独裁政权。尽管这一批先驱者失败了，但是他们的英勇创举必然会产生积极后果。
  反美反独裁斗争不断高涨
    同武装斗争相呼应的，是各国广泛阶层人民反对美国侵略、反对美国强加的独裁统治、反对美国经济掠夺和要求改善劳动和生活条件的斗争继续向前推进。这是一九六五年拉丁美洲政治形势中的又一重要特点。各国人民在“不许干涉多米尼加”的口号下动员起来了，从墨西哥到阿根廷，成千上万的群众上街示威，一百二十多个群众团体发表声明，强烈反对美国的侵略新罪行。在约翰逊政府策动建立起亲美独裁统治的玻利维亚，紧接多米尼加人民起义之后，全国十七个矿区的三万多名锡矿工人在去年五月从反对美国阴谋取消玻利维亚国有化的“矿业改组计划”开始，举行了大规模游行示威和无限期大罢工。工人们拿起武器，占领了卡塔维等主要矿区，同侵入矿区进行镇压的几千名政府军展开了十多天的英勇战斗。
    巴拿马人民在坚持反对美国强占巴拿马领土的斗争。七万五千名工人和学生在去年一月举行示威游行再度表达他们维护民族独立的斗争决心。秘鲁人民反对美国国际石油公司继续霸占秘鲁油田的运动，从去年二月起持续了三个多月，遍及好几个省。智利铜矿工人为反对美国铜公司的掠夺，向首都进军，他们高呼：“矿工们，坚定，狠狠打击美国佬！”“警惕啊，智利人，美国佬就在门口！”在厄瓜多尔，尽管独裁当局禁止一切示威游行，去年二月、五月和七月，成千上万的工人、学生和市民连续举行游行、示威和罢市，抗议美国干涉内政，要求结束独裁统治。即使是在美国策动极右派军人建立了法西斯统治的巴西，人民也不畏强暴，采取了多次的反美行动。巴西爱国者在去年十一月泛美外长特别会议的会场前举行了反独裁示威，这对于约翰逊政府又是一记沉重的打击。
    罢工浪潮此起彼伏。参加的包括工人、农业劳动者、教师、公务人员、医务工作者和其他阶层的劳动人民。以乌拉圭为例，这个国家从去年年初到十月，已经发生了六百五十次左右罢工。这些罢工都直接或间接地同反对美国垄断资本的巧取豪夺政策有关。
  反美统一战线在形成和扩大
    一九六五年拉丁美洲政治形势的另一特点是：在尖锐、激烈的民族民主革命浪潮中，各种政治力量在经历一次深刻的改组和分化。革命力量在不断扩大和加强。一个广泛的反美民族统一战线正在全拉丁美洲逐步形成和扩大。
    在去年一年里，新出现了不少坚持革命原则、坚持革命实践的政党和组织。一些国家的传统政党更加分裂了，派生出许多新的政党和派别组织，这意味着越来越多的人士识破了传统政党的反动本质。由于美国露骨地勾结右派势力在当地实行反动统治，广大中间人士已经越来越在不同的程度上采取了公开的反美立场。亲美右派势力越来越孤立，遭到人民的唾弃。以巴西的布朗库政权为例，这个政权去年十月在国内十一个州举行了掩饰门面的州长选举，结果反对派得到优势，官方候选人大批落选。连美国资产阶级报刊也在忧心忡忡地谈论布朗库政权的日子很不好过了。
    同波澜壮阔的反美统一战线的形成正相反，去年一年，美国在这个地区的统治危机空前加剧。约翰逊的军事大棒和政治控制的政策对拉丁美洲国家越来越失灵了。美国在它的“后院”遭到了不仅是全体拉丁美洲人民而且也包括一部分当权派和不少国家的部分统治势力的公开反对，这是一九六五年拉丁美洲政治形势中的又一个十分有意义的特点。
  约翰逊大棒政策越来越失灵
    美国出兵侵略多米尼加，遭到了六个国家首脑和七个国家议会的公开谴责。美国为它的侵略多米尼加的部队披上“泛美”外衣，但是除了巴西以外，没有一个有影响的拉丁美洲政府愿意提供部队充当美国帮凶。在智利、墨西哥和乌拉圭等国家带头反对下，美国成立一支西半球常设镇压部队的计划，在十一月泛美外长特别会议上搁浅。西方报界指出，这次会议暴露出泛美体系的
  “生命力目前已经达到了最低点”。
    值得指出的是，“泛美体系”内部这种对美国极为不利的局面，已经开始表现在它的外部关系上。当上届联合国大会表决恢复中华人民共和国的合法席位和美国煽动反华的所谓“西藏问题”的提案时，分别有三个和两个拉丁美洲国家背离美国而投了弃权票。美国报界惊呼这是“史无前例的行动”。这个行动是拉丁美洲国家对美国霸权的公开挑战。
    在经济方面，对美国垄断资本的积愤一再爆发成为规模空前的集体抗议行动。去年下半年，十六个产糖国家和十一个产棉国家先后对约翰逊政府增加食糖进口税和倾销棉花的立法提出联合抗议。在一九六五年岁末，墨西哥议会通过了政府提出的严禁外国资本渗入墨西哥金融部门的法案。不用说，这项措施对美国更是富有代表性的打击。
    一年来的事实表明，美国在“争取进步联盟”破产以后执行的所谓强硬路线的“约翰逊主义”，不但没有能帮助美国控制住这个大陆的反美斗争，反而大大加速了这里的革命进程。到处燃起了斗争的火焰，出现了火山溶岩喷薄欲出的爆发性局势。美国报刊不得不承认，“从拉丁美洲这一端到那一端，当前局势正在变得越来越紧张”。在美国的大门口，“危险正在集结”，而根本找不到
  “有效的解决办法”。　（新华社）（附图片）
