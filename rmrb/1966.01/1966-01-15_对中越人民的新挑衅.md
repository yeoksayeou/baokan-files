    New Provocations Against the Chinese and Vietnamese People
    Recently, U.S. imperialism's military and political leaders, Humphrey, Wheeler, Harris, and others, went to Taiwan one after another to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and conspire to intensify "cooperation" in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. According to U.S. and Taiwan newspapers, the United States is expanding its air force base in Taiwan and intends to send its B-52 strategic bombers stationed in Guam to Taiwan. Obviously, this series of activities by the U.S. aggressors is to turn Taiwan into an important military base for expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. U.S. imperialism has long occupied China's territory of Taiwan, and is now stepping up its use of Taiwan to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam. This is not only a serious provocation against the Vietnamese people, but also a new and serious provocation against the Chinese people.
    In order to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam and to save its defeat on the South Vietnamese battlefield, U.S. imperialism has sent important officials to engage in activities everywhere, recruit troops, drag people into the water, and intensify war deployments. Because it is isolated, it has no choice but to particularly rely on some puppets such as the South Korean Park Chung-hee group, the Thai reactionaries, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. However, is it not too stupid for U.S. imperialism to want to rely on these clay bodhisattvas who cannot even save themselves to help it save the defeat of the war of aggression against Vietnam?
    The barbaric war of aggression waged by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam has been met with angry condemnation and strong opposition from the people of the world. The U.S. aggressors will certainly not escape the just trial and punishment of the people of the world. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is stepping up its collusion with U.S. imperialism and wants to actively act as a pawn in the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam, which can only accelerate their demise.

### 对中越人民的新挑衅

    对中越人民的新挑衅
    最近，美帝国主义的军政头目汉弗莱、惠勒、哈里斯等，先后跑到台湾，同蒋介石匪帮进行勾结，密谋在美国侵越战争中加紧“合作”。又据美国和台湾报纸透露，美国正在扩大在台湾的空军基地，并且打算把它驻在关岛的B—52型战略轰炸机派到台湾来。很明显，美国侵略者这一系列活动，就是要把台湾变成它扩大侵越战争的一个重要军事基地。美帝国主义长期霸占中国的领土台湾，现在又加紧利用台湾来扩大侵越战争，这不仅是对越南人民的严重挑衅，而且是对中国人民的新的严重挑衅。
    美帝国主义为了扩大侵越战争，为了挽救它在南越战场上的败局，派出要员四出活动，招兵买马，拖人下水，加紧战争部署。由于处境孤立，就只好特别倚重南朝鲜朴正熙集团、泰国反动派和蒋介石匪帮等一些傀儡，然而，美帝国主义竟然想要指望这些自身难保的泥菩萨帮助它挽救侵越战争的败局，这不是太愚蠢了吗？
    美帝国主义在南越进行的野蛮的侵略战争，遭到全世界人民的愤怒谴责和强烈反对。美国侵略者是一定逃脱不了全世界人民正义的裁判和惩罚的。蒋介石匪帮加紧同美帝国主义勾结，要积极充当美帝国主义侵略越南的走卒，这只能加速他们的灭亡。
