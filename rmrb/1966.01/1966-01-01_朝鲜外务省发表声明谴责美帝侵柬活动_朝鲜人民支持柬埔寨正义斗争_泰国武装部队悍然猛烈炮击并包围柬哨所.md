    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st, a statement was issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the 31st, expressing full support for the solemn stance of the Cambodian people and government to resolutely fight back against American aggression.

    The statement pointed out that the recent authorization by the U.S. State Department to the U.S. military in South Vietnam to attack Cambodian territory at any time, and the repeated strafing and bombing of peaceful residential areas of Cambodia by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppet army, are serious acts of trampling on the national independence and sovereignty of the Cambodian people. These acts of aggression truthfully expose the bandit nature of U.S. imperialism.

    The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people resolutely condemn the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism against Cambodia, fully support the solemn and firm stance expressed in the statements made by the Royal Government of Cambodia on December 25th and 26th, and express militant solidarity with the struggle of the courageous Cambodian people.

    The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism has long colluded with Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppet clique to carry out various sabotage activities against the national independence and independent development of the Cambodian people, and has continuously carried out provocative activities against the border areas of Cambodia. In particular, recently, U.S. imperialism has flagrantly violated Cambodian territory and blatantly carried out aggressive activities against the Cambodian people.

    U.S. imperialism is also frantically struggling, attempting to expand the war of aggression against the Vietnamese people to the entire Indochina region.

    The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people strongly demand that U.S. imperialism immediately cease all aggressive actions against Cambodia and get out of Indochina immediately.

    The statement said that the Korean people will continue to actively support and aid the Cambodian people in their struggle to defend the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of their motherland, and will advance shoulder to shoulder with them in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

    If U.S. imperialism ignores the opposition and protests of the Cambodian people and peace-loving people all over the world, and continues its foolish aggressive actions against Cambodia, it will inevitably suffer a shameful and disastrous defeat.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 31st, according to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 31st, the General Staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces announced in a preliminary message on the 30th that approximately 200 Thai armed forces, starting from 5 a.m. on the 30th, heavily bombarded the Cambodian outpost in O Smach, Oddar Meanchey Province, with mortars and surrounded the outpost, which is about 1,500 meters from the border.

    This offensive, led by Thai helicopters, caused casualties among Cambodian soldiers, and the outpost barracks were burned down by mortar fire. The Cambodian local military authorities have dispatched the first batch of reinforcements to the invaded area.

    The Cambodian newspaper *Fatherland* commented on the 31st on the Thai army's shelling and surrounding of the Cambodian outpost, saying that Thailand and U.S. imperialism must bear full responsibility for this aggression.

    The commentary said that the people of all strata in Cambodia have expressed their determination at the recently concluded 20th National Congress of the People's Socialist Community to resolutely fight back against all aggressive actions by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The commentary condemned the Thai government for stubbornly relying on U.S. imperialism to invade Cambodia.

    据新华社平壤三十一日电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省三十一日发表声明，表示完全支持柬埔寨人民和政府决心反击美国侵略的严正立场。
    声明指出，美国国务院最近授予在南越的美军以随时进攻柬埔寨领土的“权限”，以及美帝国主义及其走狗泰国和南越傀儡军多次对柬埔寨和平居民地区进行扫射和轰炸的行为，是对柬埔寨人民的民族独立和主权的严重的践踏行为，这种侵略行为如实地暴露出美帝国主义的强盗本性。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义对柬埔寨的侵略活动，完全支持柬埔寨王国政府在十二月二十五日和二十六日的声明中所表明的严正的和坚定的立场，并对勇敢的柬埔寨人民的斗争表示战斗的声援。
    声明指出，美帝国主义很早以来就同泰国和南越傀儡集团合伙，进行各种破坏活动，反对柬埔寨人民的民族独立和自主发展，并且不断地对柬埔寨的边境地区进行挑衅活动。尤其是最近，美帝国主义明目张胆地侵犯柬埔寨的领土，露骨地进行反对柬埔寨人民的侵略活动。
    美帝国主义还正在疯狂地挣扎，妄图把反对越南人民的侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那地区。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民强硬要求美帝国主义立即停止对柬埔寨的各种侵略行动，马上从印度支那滚出去。
    声明说，朝鲜人民今后仍将继续积极支持和声援柬埔寨人民保卫自己祖国的自由、独立和主权的斗争，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中同他们并肩前进。
    如果美帝国主义无视柬埔寨人民和全世界爱好和平人民的反对和抗议，继续进行反对柬埔寨的愚蠢的侵略行动，它必将遭到可耻的惨败。
    据新华社金边三十一日电据柬埔寨新闻社三十一日报道，柬埔寨王家武装部队总参谋部在三十日发表的初步消息说，泰国武装部队约二百人，从三十日上午五时开始，用迫击炮猛烈轰击柬埔寨奥多棉藏省奥斯马地方的哨所，并且包围这个距边界约一千五百米的哨所。
    这次泰国以直升飞机为前导的进攻，使柬埔寨士兵遭受死伤，哨所营房被迫击炮击中烧毁。柬埔寨地方军事当局已派出第一批增援部队赶往被侵略的地点。
    柬埔寨《祖国报》三十一日就泰国军队轰击并且包围柬埔寨哨所发表评论说，泰国和美帝国主义必须对这次侵略负全部责任。
    评论说，高棉各阶层人民在最近召开的人民社会同盟第二十次全国代表大会上已经表明决心，对美帝国主义及其走狗的一切侵略行动要坚决予以回击。评论谴责泰国政府执意投靠美帝国主义来侵略柬埔寨。
