    In his "State of the Union Address," Johnson tried his best to portray himself as the protector of the interests of the South Vietnamese people, saying that the reason the United States must "stay" in South Vietnam is to ensure that the South Vietnamese people are not "cruelly treated by their enemies."

    While Johnson was spouting this nonsense, the American invading forces were implementing an inhumane "scorched earth" plan in South Vietnam, implementing a barbaric policy of "burn all, kill all, destroy all" everywhere. The South Vietnamese people, who have been so cruelly treated by the American invaders, know better than anyone who their mortal enemies are. It is precisely to prevent the American robbers from "staying" that they are determined to fight to the end.

    Australian accomplice troops, accompanying the American invading forces in a "sweep" of the "Iron Triangle" area of South Vietnam, suffered the consequences of their own actions on the 12th when they released poison gas, resulting in one death and six poisonings.

    The U.S. military authorities in Vietnam are frantically using poison gas to slaughter innocent people in South Vietnam, yet they claim they are pursuing "humanitarianism." Now its accomplice troops have also tasted the taste of this "humanitarianism."

    The "Psychological Warfare Minister" of the South Vietnamese puppet army, Deng Dingzhen, told reporters when talking about the recent U.S.-launched "peace offensive" that he did not believe the United States would abandon South Vietnam and conduct "peace talks" with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    After all, he is the "Psychological Warfare Minister," and he knows the true psychology of his American master. No matter how hard the likes of Johnson try to pretend to be willing to reconcile, their lackeys know the truth.

    三言两语
    约翰逊在他的“国情咨文”中竭力把自己说成是南越人民利益的保卫者，说什么美国所以定要在南越“留下来”，就是为了保证不让南越人民“受到他们的敌人的残酷对待”。
    当约翰逊说这种鬼话的时候，美国侵略军正在南越推行灭绝人性的“焦土”计划，到处实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”的野蛮政策。受到美国侵略者这样残酷对待的南越人民比谁都清楚谁是他们的死敌。他们正是为了不让美国强盗“留下来”而决心战斗到底。

    随同美国侵略军在南越“铁三角”地带进行“扫荡”的澳大利亚帮凶军，十二日在施放毒气时自食其果，一人丧命，六人中毒。
    侵越美军当局在南越疯狂使用毒气屠杀无辜人民，却说什么他们在奉行
  “人道主义”。现在它的帮凶军自己也尝到这种“人道主义”的味道了。

    南越伪军的“心理作战部长”邓定镇对记者谈到美国最近发动的“和平攻势”时说，他不相信美国会放弃南越，与越南民主共和国进行“和谈”。
    到底是“心理作战部长”，他深知美国主子的真实心理。不管约翰逊之流怎样竭力装出愿意和解的样子，他们的奴才却是心里有数的。
