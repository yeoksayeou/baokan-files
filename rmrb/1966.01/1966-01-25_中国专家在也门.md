    The Sana'a Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory has only been under construction for a little over a year, since its groundbreaking in September 1964. However, the construction site has undergone tremendous changes. On what was once an uneven field of crops, workshops, warehouses, and various ancillary facilities of all sizes have sprung up in rows. Some are being renovated and decorated, while others are at the peak of construction. At each construction site, Chinese experts and Yemeni workers are working shoulder to shoulder in intense labor. Every day, the construction site receives many Yemeni friends who come to visit. Among them are officials from all levels of the Yemeni government, as well as tribal people riding donkeys; there are old people with canes, and women with veils. They praise the work attitude of the Chinese experts, saying that the great progress made in the factory construction in such a short period is a "miracle," "like magic."

    Chinese experts not only work with their own hands, but also overcome the difficulties of language barriers and patiently train Yemeni workers. At the construction site, experts can often be seen working with Yemeni workers to discuss and solve problems that arise during construction. Yemeni workers also earnestly learn technology and actively cooperate with the experts. Many Yemeni workers from the countryside are now able to work independently under the guidance of experts. When the steel bar workshop has a heavy workload, Yemeni workers voluntarily give up their Sunday rest time to work overtime with the experts at the construction site.

    Through common labor, experts and Yemeni workers have formed a deep friendship. Once, expert Comrade Xiao Yang injured his foot in the course of his work, and the Yemeni workers who worked with him visited him in the dormitory several times. Some Yemeni workers also invite their familiar experts to attend their weddings. The experts also treat Yemeni workers like their own brothers. When encountering some dangerous operations, the experts always compete to do it themselves. Some comrades even give their labor protection equipment to Yemeni workers. If some Yemeni workers are accidentally injured in the course of their work, the experts will bandage them and accompany them to see a doctor. Doctors among the experts also take time to provide free treatment for the families of Yemeni employees and the surrounding residents. Our experts engaged in water source exploration were preparing to return to China after completing the factory's water supply task. Suddenly, they received a request from the Yemeni government to drill agricultural wells in the arid Raudah area on the outskirts of Sana'a. They undertook this new task without hesitation, despite insufficient manpower and resources.

    Yemen, known as the "Arab Paradise," is a country that abounds in cotton. However, for a long time, the cotton cloth needed by the people has all been imported. Building a modern cotton textile printing and dyeing factory is a long-cherished dream of the Yemeni people. This wish also strongly encourages every Chinese expert who helps build the factory. Sana'a is more than 2,000 meters above sea level, and the climate is extremely dry. Most of our experts come from the humid south of the motherland, and are not very adapted to the high-altitude climate here. Many people feel headaches, nausea, dry mouth, and shortness of breath, and some comrades have to cover their noses with a wet towel at night to fall asleep. However, everyone always maintains a strong enthusiasm and works vigorously. In life, they also always keep in mind the teachings of the Party and share weal and woe with the Yemeni people. In the early stages of construction, experts were scattered in civilian houses in the city. In order to facilitate work and reduce the burden on the Yemeni people, the experts and Yemeni workers worked together to build rows of temporary dormitories and offices on the construction site in three months. The experts also used their spare time to turn the open spaces beside the houses and roads into small plots of land, and sprinkled them with vegetable seeds such as cabbage and radish brought from the motherland. This simple and hard-working lifestyle of the experts has also left a deep impression on Yemeni friends. A leader of the Yemeni government said: "Only Chinese experts do not trouble us with living problems!"

    Our beloved motherland is leaping forward, and her sons and daughters sent to distant lands are also determined to help the Yemeni people put on colorful clothes woven with their own hands as soon as possible in the new year, so that this flower of friendship between the Chinese and Yemeni people will bloom even more brightly and fragrantly!

    中国专家在也门
    萨那棉纺织印染厂，自一九六四年九月奠基到现在，才经历了一年多的时间。但工地面貌却已发生了巨大的变化。在原先的一片坎坷不平的庄稼地上，鳞次栉比地耸立起了大大小小的车间、仓库和各种附属设施，有的已在修整打扮，有的正处施工高峰。在各个施工地点，中国专家和也门工人肩并肩地进行着紧张的劳动。工地每天都要接待很多前来参观的也门朋友。他们中间，有也门政府的各级官员，也有骑着毛驴的部落群众；有手拄拐棍的老人，也有蒙着面纱的妇女。他们啧啧赞扬中国专家的工作态度，说建厂工程在短短的期间内，取得这样大的进展是“奇迹”，“象变魔术一样”。
    中国专家不仅亲自动手，还克服语言不通的困难，耐心地培养也门工人。在工地，经常可以看到专家同也门工人在一起切磋琢磨，解决施工中产生的问题。也门工人也认真学习技术，积极配合专家。许多从农村来的也门工人，现在已能在专家指导下独立进行工作。当钢筋车间工作任务较重时，也门工人便主动地放弃星期天的休息时间，来工地同专家一块儿加班。
    通过共同的劳动，专家和也门工人结成了深厚的友谊。有一次，专家小杨同志在工作中摔伤了脚，同他一起工作的也门工人几次到宿舍去看望他。有的也门工人结婚时，也要邀请自己熟悉的专家参加婚礼。专家也象对待自己的亲兄弟一样地对待也门工人。遇到一些危险的作业时，专家总是争着自己去干。有些同志还把自己的劳动保护用品让给也门工人用。有的也门工人在工作中不慎负了伤，专家便替他包扎，陪去看医生。专家中的医生，还抽出时间为也门职工的家属以及周围的居民免费治疗。我们从事水源勘探的专家，在完成了工厂的供水任务后，正准备回国。忽然，接到也门政府提出的为萨那市郊干旱的劳达赫地区打农业用井的要求。他们便在人力、物力不足的情况下，毫不犹豫地承担起了这一新的任务。
    号称“阿拉伯乐园”的也门，是一个盛产棉花的国家。但是，长期以来人民所需棉布却全仰进口。建设一座现代化的棉纺织印染厂，是也门人民梦寐以求的理想。这个愿望也强烈地鼓舞了每一个帮助建厂的中国专家。萨那拔海两千多米，气候又异常干燥。我们的专家，大部分来自祖国湿润的南方，对这儿的高原气候很不适应。不少人感到头疼噁心，口干气喘，个别同志晚上得在鼻子上捂上块湿毛巾才能入眠。但是，大家始终保持着旺盛的热情，精神抖擞地进行工作。在生活上，也时刻牢记党的教导，同也门人民同甘共苦。施工初期，专家都分散住在市内的民房里。为了方便工作，并减少也门人民的负担，专家和也门工人一起，用了三个月的时间，在工地盖起了一排排临时宿舍和办公室。专家还利用业余时间，把屋边道旁的空地，开成一小块、一小块的，撒上了从祖国捎来的白菜、萝卜等菜籽。专家这种艰苦朴素的生活作风，也给也门朋友留下了深刻的印象。一位也门政府的领导人说：“只有中国专家不在生活问题上麻烦我们！”
    亲爱的祖国在飞跃向前，她派在远方的儿女也决心在新的一年里，帮助也门人民早日穿上用自己双手织出的绚丽多彩的衣服，让这支中也人民友谊的花朵开得更加鲜艳芬芳！
