    Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: Washington news—Beset by constant failures in the war of aggression against Vietnam and facing unprecedented isolation at home and abroad, the Johnson administration has recently launched a massive so-called "peace offensive" in a vain attempt to deceive the American people and world public opinion and conceal its ongoing conspiracy to intensify the expansion of the war.
    This "peace offensive" commenced on December 29th of last year. On that day, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kohler met with Soviet Presidium Chairman Podgorny. The U.S. government pieced together some "peace talk" proposals that had long been exposed by the Vietnamese people into a so-called "fourteen-point" plan for "seeking a peaceful solution" to the Vietnam issue and dispatched a team of high-ranking officials, including Ambassador-at-Large Harriman, Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg, Assistant Secretary of State Williams, Special Advisor to the President Bundy, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Mann, and Vice President Humphrey, dividing them into six routes to parade around the world and deceive people.
    After arriving in Warsaw on December 29th, Harriman met successively with Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki and First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Gomulka. The joint communique issued after his meeting with Rapacki stated that Harriman, "at the request of President Johnson, informed the Polish government, as a member of the International Control and Supervision Commission for Vietnam, of the U.S. government's views on Vietnam." Harriman then traveled to countries such as Yugoslavia, India, Pakistan, Iran, and the United Arab Republic, and on the 5th, he went to Japan via Thailand.
    Starting on December 29th, Goldberg visited the Vatican, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. During his stay in Paris, he also attended a secret meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Permanent Council. After returning to the United States to report to Johnson, Goldberg also handed a letter to United Nations Secretary-General U Thant on the 5th, requesting that it be distributed as a document of the Security Council to the governments of all member states of the United Nations. This letter once again asked UN member states to "individually and collectively use their influence to promote" the U.S. "unconditional discussions" hoax.
    Williams began visiting Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria on the 1st. He is currently in Ghana.
    Humphrey held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Sato in Tokyo on December 29th, and then traveled to other regions in the Far East.
    Bundy traveled to Canada on December 29th, and Johnson also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Pearson on the phone.
    Thomas Mann traveled to Mexico on the 1st. Rusk summoned the Latin American envoys to Washington on the 5th to peddle the U.S. "peace talk" conspiracy to them.
    According to the U.S. government, U.S. "envoys" will visit more countries in the future. U.S. envoys in various countries have been ordered to notify the governments of their host countries of the U.S. position. As the British *Sunday Telegraph* said, the U.S. envoys are flying all over the place, which resembles a "dazzling circus performance." It is reported that when the U.S. "envoys" are traveling around, their briefcases all carry the same list, which is the "fourteen-point plan."
    While peddling his "peace talk" fraud everywhere, the Johnson administration also publicized that the United States had "suspended bombing" of North Vietnam starting from December 24th, and bluntly stated that this was part of the U.S. "peace offensive." Goldberg told reporters in Paris on December 31st that the purpose of the U.S. "suspension of bombing" was to "initiate negotiations on the Vietnam War," which was "self-evident." To make this trick more deceptive, Johnson deliberately did not announce the duration of the "suspension of bombing." However, U.S. government officials, congressmen, and newspapers have long stated that the Johnson administration will resume bombing when the U.S. "peace" fraud fails. This shows that, like last time, this so-called "suspension of bombing" is also a blatant act of war blackmail.
    It is worth noting that on December 28th, the day before the United States launched its "peace offensive," the Soviet Union announced that Politburo member of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Shelepin would lead a delegation to visit Hanoi. Kohler then held an hour-long meeting with Podgorny. Prior to this, Kohler had also held talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov on December 22nd and 24th, respectively, on the Vietnam issue. The U.S. *Christian Science Monitor* pointed out on January 1st that the U.S. "suspension of bombing" of North Vietnam and Shelepin's visit are not merely coincidences, "in a very real sense, Moscow and Washington are pointing in the same direction on the Vietnam issue."
    At the same time, British Prime Minister Wilson vigorously promoted the U.S. position. He said on January 1st, "No matter how much disappointment and setbacks we suffer, we must continue to work hard" and "use all means at our disposal to bring the parties concerned to the negotiating table." He also met with the Soviet chargé d'affaires in the United Kingdom on the 3rd, and again advocated that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, in their capacity as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, request the reopening of the Geneva Conference on the Vietnam issue. The Yugoslav Tito clique vigorously praised Johnson's "suspension of bombing" as a "positive initiative." The Indian Shastri government reaffirmed India's support for the United States. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant and Pope Paul VI also actively assisted the United States. However, many countries have reacted coldly to the U.S. request for their help.
    The Johnson administration's "greatest global performance" (*Sunday Telegraph*) is being carried out at a time when the U.S. aggressor troops are being driven to a dead end by the Vietnamese people and are frantically preparing to further expand the war. Its purpose is obviously to deceive and oppress the American people into paying money and risking their lives for this war of aggression, while at the same time quelling internal disputes within the ruling group so that Congress can pass new huge military appropriations and huge new budgets; to win the sympathy and support of its allies and other countries, or at least to reduce the pressure of their condemnation.
    However, Johnson's trick is so clumsy that the Western press immediately pointed out that Johnson's "diplomatic performance" is nothing more than shirking responsibility for expanding the war and paving the way for expanding the war. The British *Financial Times* wrote on December 30th of last year: "For the sake of world and American opinion, President Johnson must show that he has done everything possible to stop the war before letting the war enter a new and more dangerous phase." The *Sunday Telegraph* pointed out on January 2nd that Johnson sent various envoys to the capitals of many countries, "with the aim of convincing bystanders, rather than America's enemies, that America wants a settlement." Johnson's "whole approach is nothing more than a massive campaign to win over the masses."
    The French *Le Monde* wrote on December 31st of last year: This "peace offensive" is intended to "prove to American and international public opinion that the United States has done everything possible to try to end the war" if the war "continues and expands." On the same day, *Nation* published an article saying that Johnson launched such a "rare" "peace offensive" in order to "show his 'sincerity' and reveal the 'malice' of his opponents to the world, especially to the American people."
    Even U.S. newspapers and news agencies do not shy away from this point. Associated Press correspondent Hightower in Washington pointed out in a commentary on January 3rd that Johnson did this in an attempt to show that: "Whatever action the United States may take there (referring to Vietnam), the responsibility rests entirely with the communist enemy." He also pointed out that this would make it easier for Johnson to ask Congress for more troops and more money. He wrote: "The Vietnam War is expected to add more than $10 billion to the President's budget, coupled with the gradual escalation of manpower, which gives special significance to the (peace) offensive launched by the President during the Christmas-New Year period." An editorial published by *The Christian Science Monitor* on December 31st of last year also pointed out, "The result of this activity may make the budget figures for the next fiscal year very different."
    While the Johnson administration is releasing a smoke screen of "peace talks," it is making various military deployments to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. At the same time that Johnson launched this "peace offensive," the advance units of the Third Brigade of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division were flowing into South Vietnam. Before and after this, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, Secretary of the Air Force Brown, Secretary of the Army Resor, Army Chief of Staff H. Johnson, and others went to South Vietnam and Thailand, Okinawa, and Hawaii, which served as strategic bases for the war of aggression against Vietnam, to plan actions to expand the war. Wheeler convened a military meeting in Honolulu on the 3rd. U.S. Vice President Humphrey also recently rushed to Tokyo, Manila, Seoul, and Taipei to lobby for support and recruit cannon fodder for the U.S. expansion of the war. In addition, the United States is vigorously rushing to repair airports, ports, docks, and warehouses in South Vietnam and Thailand to cope with the needs of the expanded war.

### 美国使节奔走莫斯科伦敦梵蒂冈新德里东京等地兴风作浪  约翰逊发动大规模和平攻势掩盖扩大战争阴谋  美报说“莫斯科和华盛顿在越南问题上都指向同一方向”

    美国使节奔走莫斯科伦敦梵蒂冈新德里东京等地兴风作浪
    约翰逊发动大规模和平攻势掩盖扩大战争阴谋
    美报说“莫斯科和华盛顿在越南问题上都指向同一方向”
    新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：在侵越战争中不断失败，在国内外空前孤立的约翰逊政府，最近发动了一个大规模的所谓“和平攻势”，妄图借以欺骗美国人民和世界舆论，掩盖它正在加紧进行的扩大战争的阴谋。
    这个“和平攻势”是在去年十二月二十九日开场的。在这一天，美国驻苏联大使科勒会见了苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内。美国政府把它过去早就被越南人民揭穿的一些“和谈”建议拼凑成一个所谓“谋求和平解决”越南问题的“十四点”计划，并派出无任所大使哈里曼、驻联合国大使戈德堡、助理国务卿威廉斯、总统特别顾问邦迪、副国务卿托马斯·曼和副总统汉弗莱等大员分兵六路到世界各地招摇撞骗。
    哈里曼在十二月二十九日抵达华沙后先后会见了波兰外交部长腊帕茨基和波兰统一工人党第一书记哥穆尔卡。他同腊帕茨基会谈后发表的联合公报说，哈里曼“应约翰逊总统的请求把美国政府关于越南的看法告诉了作为越南国际监察和监督委员会委员的波兰政府”。哈里曼接着跑到南斯拉夫、印度、巴基斯坦、伊朗和阿联等国活动，并在五日经泰国前往日本。
    戈德堡从十二月二十九日开始先后访问了梵蒂冈、意大利、法国和英国，他在巴黎期间还出席了北大西洋集团常设理事会秘密会议。在返回美国向约翰逊汇报后，戈德堡五日还把一封信件交给联合国秘书长吴丹，要求作为安全理事会的文件分发给联合国各成员国政府。这封信又一次要求联合国成员国“个别地和集体地运用它们的影响来促成”美国的“无条件讨论”骗局。
    威廉斯从一日开始先后访问了摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、埃塞俄比亚、肯尼亚、坦桑尼亚、乌干达、尼日利亚。他目前在加纳。
    汉弗莱十二月二十九日在东京同日本首相佐藤会谈，接着又到远东其他一些地区活动。
    邦迪十二月二十九日到加拿大活动，约翰逊还同加拿大总理皮尔逊通了电话。
    托马斯·曼一日到墨西哥活动。腊斯克五日召见了拉丁美洲国家驻华盛顿使节，向他们兜售美国的“和谈”阴谋。
    据美国政府宣布，美国“特使”今后还要访问更多的国家。美国驻各国使节已奉命把美国的态度通知驻在国政府。正如英国《星期日电讯报》所说，美国使节满天飞，这酷似一场“五光十色的马戏表演”。据报道，在美国“特使”风尘仆仆，四出活动时，他们的公事包里都带着同样的一张单子，这就是“十四点计划”。
    约翰逊政府在到处兜售他的“和谈”骗局时，还宣传美国从去年十二月二十四日开始已对越南北方“暂停轰炸”，并且露骨表示这是美国“和平攻势”的一部分。戈德堡十二月三十一日在巴黎对记者说，美国“暂停轰炸”的目的是要“引起对越南战争的谈判”，这是“不言自明”的。为了使这个花招更带欺骗性，约翰逊还故意不宣布“暂停轰炸”的期限。但是美国政府官员、议员和报刊早就表明，在美国的“和平”骗局落空时，约翰逊政府将恢复轰炸。这就说明，和上次一样，这次所谓“暂停轰炸”也是不折不扣的战争讹诈。
    值得注意的是，在美国大搞“和平攻势”的前一天，十二月二十八日晚上，苏联宣布苏共中央主席团委员、苏共中央书记谢列平即将率领一个代表团访问河内。科勒接着就同波德戈尔内举行一小时的会谈。在这以前，科勒还曾经在十二月二十二日和二十四日就越南问题分别同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫会谈。美国《基督教科学箴言报》一月一日指出，美国“暂停轰炸”越南北方和谢列平的出访，并不仅仅是巧合，“从非常实在的意义上讲，莫斯科和华盛顿在越南问题上都指向同一方向”。
    与此同时，英国首相威尔逊大力为美国摇旗呐喊。他在一月一日说，“不管遭到多大的失望和挫折，我们要继续努力”，“使用我们所能使用的各种手段来使有关各方来到会议桌旁”。他三日还接见了苏联驻英代办，再次鼓吹英苏两国以日内瓦会议两主席的身份要求重开关于越南问题的日内瓦会议。南斯拉夫铁托集团大力吹捧约翰逊的“暂停轰炸”是“积极的主动行动”。印度夏斯特里政府重申印度对美国的支持。联合国秘书长吴丹和罗马教皇保罗六世也积极为美国帮腔。但是，许多国家对美国要它们出来帮忙却反应冷淡。
    约翰逊政府这次搞这样一个“最大的寰球表演”（《星期日电讯报》），是在美国侵略军被越南人民打得走投无路，正在疯狂地准备进一步扩大战争情况下采取的。其目的显然是为了欺骗和压迫美国人民为这场侵略战争出钱卖命，同时平息统治集团内部的争吵，以便国会能通过新的巨额军事拨款和庞大的新预算；骗取它的盟国及其他国家的同情和支持，或者至少是，减轻它们责难的压力。
    但是，约翰逊这一花招是如此笨拙，以致西方报刊一开始就明白指出，约翰逊的这套“外交表演”，无非是推卸扩大战争的罪责，为扩大战争开路。英国的《金融时报》去年十二月三十日写道：“为了世界舆论和美国舆论的缘故，约翰逊总统必须在让战争进入一个新的、更加危险的阶段之前表明，他已竭尽了一切可能来使战争停止。”《星期日电讯报》一月二日指出，约翰逊派出各种特使前往许多国家的首都，“其目的更多地是要使旁观者而不是使美国的敌人相信美国是希望求得解决的”。约翰逊的“整个作法不过是一次大举争取群众的活动”。
    法国的《世界报》去年十二月三十一日写道：这次“和平攻势”是在战争“如果继续和扩大下去的情况下，要向美国和国际舆论证明，美国业已竭尽全力来企图结束这场战争”。同一天，《民族报》发表文章说，约翰逊发动这样一次“罕见的”“和平攻势”，是为了“显示他的‘诚意’，而向全世界、特别是向美国人民揭示对手的‘恶意’。”
      甚至美国的报刊、通讯社也不讳言这一点。美联社驻华盛顿记者海托华一月三日在一则述评中指出，约翰逊这样作是企图表明：“不论美国在那里
  （按指越南）可能采取什么行动，责任完全是在共产党敌人那边”。他还指出，这样就便于约翰逊要求国会增兵、增款。他写道：“预料越南战争将使总统的预算增加一百多亿美元，再加上人力的逐步升级，就使总统在圣诞节——新年期间发动的（和平）攻势具有特殊意义。”《基督教科学箴言报》在去年十二月三十一日发表的一篇社论也指出，“这种活动的结果，可能使下一个财政年度的预算数字大不相同”。
    约翰逊政府在大放“和谈”烟幕的同时，正在军事上为进一步扩大侵越战争加强种种部署。就在约翰逊发动这次“和平攻势”的同时，美国第二十五步兵师第三旅的先头部队正源源开赴南越。在这前后，美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒、空军部长布朗、陆军部长里索、陆军参谋长哈·约翰逊等人相继去南越及作为侵越战略基地的泰国、冲绳、夏威夷等地，策划扩大战争的行动。惠勒三日在檀香山召开了军事会议。美国副总统汉弗莱也在最近匆匆赶到东京、马尼拉、汉城及台北活动，为美国扩大战争争取支持和搜罗炮灰。此外，美国正在南越及泰国大力赶修机场、港口、码头、仓库，以应付扩大战争的需要。
