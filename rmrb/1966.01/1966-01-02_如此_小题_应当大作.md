    Such a "Minor Matter" Should Be Made a Big Deal Of
    One cold morning, the workers of the Third Shift of the Twelfth Team of the Daqing Oilfield had just gotten off work when they heard that a screw on a well about to be tested for production was leaking water. They didn't bother to rest and ran to the well. When they arrived at the wellhead, they saw a few drops of water on a screw. It turned out that the screw was a little off, and it needed to be removed and re-tightened. However, the screw was pressed down by other screws, making it difficult to remove. Should they ignore it? No, everyone thought that a slightly misaligned screw, even if it was just a small problem of a few drops of water leaking, was a major issue related to the team's work style if left unattended. So everyone immediately got to work. They worked busily all morning, covering themselves in ice and mud, and finally tightened the screw and eliminated the leak.
    Some people may think this is a bit of an "overreaction," but no, because what they were correcting was not just a screw, but more importantly, people's thinking. What they eliminated was not just a few drops of water leaking from a screw, but more importantly, they plugged the loopholes in people's work style of being unserious and irresponsible. Such a "minor matter" should be made a big deal of.

    如此“小题”应当大作
    一个严寒的早晨，大庆油田作业十二队三班的工人刚下班，听说就要验交投产的一口井有颗螺丝渗水，他们顾不上休息又往井上跑。到井口一看，果然一颗螺丝上有几滴水珠。原来这颗螺丝有点偏，需要卸下来重新上正。可是，这颗螺丝被其它几颗螺丝压着，要卸下来很费事。不管它吗？不，大伙认为，一颗螺丝偏了点，固然是只渗几滴水的小问题，可是放下不管，确是关系到队伍作风的大问题。于是大伙马上动起手来，忙碌了一上午，弄得人人浑身上下全是冰凌和泥水，终于把螺丝上正，消灭了渗漏。
    有人也许觉得这有点“小题大作”，不，因为他们校正的不仅是一颗螺丝，更重要的是校正了人们的思想，他们消灭的也不仅是一颗螺丝上渗漏几滴水，更重要的是堵住了人们作风上不严肃不认真的漏洞。这样的“小题”就应当大作。
