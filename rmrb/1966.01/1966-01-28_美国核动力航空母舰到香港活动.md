    US Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier Arrives in Hong Kong
    (Xinhua News Agency, January 27) It is reported that the US nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise," which is participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam, arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of January 26. The "Enterprise" was hastily deployed to the waters off Vietnam by US imperialism to reinforce the American invading forces, in the wake of repeated defeats in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Recently, the US aggressor troops in Vietnam have frequently dispatched large numbers of aircraft from this ship to carry out frenzied bombing raids on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnamese liberated areas, slaughtering the Vietnamese people. Now, just as the Johnson administration's plot of peace talks has suffered a disgraceful failure and it is attempting to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, this nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has come to Hong Kong, which cannot but arouse great anger among local residents. Relevant parties are closely watching this situation.

    美国核动力航空母舰到香港活动
    新华社二十七日讯　据悉，参加侵略越南战争的美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”于一月二十六日上午开抵香港。“企业号”是美帝国主义在侵略越南战争连遭失败的情况下匆忙调往越南海面增援美国侵略军的。近一时期以来，侵略越南美军经常出动该舰大批飞机对越南民主共和国和南越解放区狂轰滥炸，屠杀越南人民。现在，正当约翰逊政府玩弄和谈骗局遭到可耻失败、妄图进一步扩大侵略越南战争的时候，这艘核动力航空母舰开到香港活动，不能不引起当地居民的极大愤怒。有关方面对此正在密切注视中。
