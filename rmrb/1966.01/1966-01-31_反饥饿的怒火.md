    Anti-hunger Fury

    The Indian food shortage is worsening daily, and the Indian government, disregarding the lives of the people, is cutting food rations. The masses in Kerala have reached the limit of their endurance and have risen up to wage a struggle against hunger. And the food shortage situation in Kerala is not the most severe in all of India. According to Indian bourgeois newspapers, more than 100 million people in India today are short of food, and no fewer than 30 million are in a "critical situation." One can imagine how acute the class contradictions in India have become.

    The increasingly serious food problem in India is entirely the result of the Indian ruling clique's implementation of anti-people policies. The Indian reactionaries are willing to sell out national interests and rely on American imperialism, which is bound to cause great disasters for the Indian people. It now pins its hopes of alleviating the food shortage on American relief, which is completely putting the cart before the horse. Continuing in this way will inevitably lead to an uncontrollable situation.

    The Indian reactionaries once tried to divert the attention of the people at home by opposing China. However, their magic weapon is becoming increasingly ineffective. People always need to eat. If the common people cannot survive, they will naturally resist. The Indian ruling authorities place the broad masses of people on the line between hunger and death. How can they expect the Indian people not to rise up against their reactionary policies? The Indian authorities even use force to suppress the anti-hunger struggle of the people. Their perverse actions can only add fuel to the fire and arouse even greater anger and resistance from the Indian people.

    反饥饿的怒火
    印度粮荒日益恶化，印度政府不顾人民死活，削减粮食配给量。喀拉拉邦群众已忍无可忍，奋起举行反饥饿斗争。而喀拉拉邦的粮荒情况在印度全国中还不是最严重的，据印度资产阶级报纸透露，在今天的印度有一亿以上的人口缺粮，“处境危急”的不下三千万人。印度的阶级矛盾已到了何等尖锐的地步，是可以想见的。
    印度的粮食问题越来越严重，这完全是印度统治集团执行反人民政策的结果。印度反动派甘心出卖民族利益，投靠美帝国主义，就必然要给印度人民造成巨大灾难。它现在把解救粮荒的希望寄托在美国的救济上，这完全是舍本逐末，继续这样下去，必将会弄到不可收拾的局面。
    印度反动派曾经想靠反华来转移国内人民的注意。但是，他们的这种法宝是越来越不灵了。人总是要吃饭的。老百姓活不下去就自然要反抗。印度统治当局把广大人民置于饥饿和死亡线上，怎么能够指望印度人民不起来反对他们的反动政策呢？印度当局竟然用武力镇压人民群众的反饥饿斗争。他们的这种倒行逆施，只能是火上加油，激起印度人民更大的愤怒和反抗。
