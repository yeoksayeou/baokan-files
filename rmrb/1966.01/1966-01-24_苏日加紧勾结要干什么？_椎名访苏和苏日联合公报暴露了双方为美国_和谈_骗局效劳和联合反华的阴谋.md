    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 23rd: Amidst the Soviet Union's new leadership strengthening its collusion with Japan's Sato government, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina, at the invitation of the Soviet government, paid an official visit to the Soviet Union from January 16th to 22nd.
    As reported, Etsusaburo Shiina met with Soviet leaders Kosygin, Podgorny, and others, and held two talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on the 19th and 20th, and signed a Soviet-Japanese Joint Communiqué on the 22nd.
    The Soviet-Japanese Joint Communiqué, released by TASS in Moscow on the 22nd, stated that "the two sides had a beneficial exchange of views on issues of further developing Soviet-Japanese relations and major international issues of concern to both sides," and that "both sides expressed satisfaction that good-neighborly relations are gradually developing and that problems arising between the two countries are being resolved." The Joint Communiqué stated that due to the "successful conclusion of the negotiations" between Shiina and Gromyko, the two countries signed the Soviet-Japanese Aviation Agreement and the Long-Term Trade and Payments Agreement for 1966-1970. Both sides also agreed to "conclude a Soviet-Japanese Consular Treaty as soon as possible—discussions on the treaty are currently underway—and consider the issue of establishing consulates in each other's countries."
    Kyodo News reported the atmosphere at the signing ceremony of these two agreements, saying that Soviet officials reached out to Foreign Minister Shiina from all directions, "Even Foreign Minister Gromyko, who is usually serious, smiled broadly at this time and shook Shiina's hand tightly three times."
    When discussing the results of the Soviet-Japanese talks on the Vietnam issue, the communiqué, without distinguishing between right and wrong, and without condemning the United States' aggression against Vietnam, absurdly claimed that both sides "emphasized that the situation in Vietnam is a threat to peace." This once again exposes the Khrushchev revisionists' treacherous stance on the Vietnam issue. According to reports, during the talks between Shiina and Gromyko, Shiina actively acted as a broker for the U.S. "peace talk" swindle, attacked the four demands of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and demanded that the Soviet Union exert its influence to promote the realization of the U.S. "peace talk" swindle.
    The communiqué touted that both sides believed it was necessary to "strengthen the United Nations," achieve complete and thorough disarmament, and conclude a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. According to Kyodo News, all these issues were proactively raised by Gromyko, and Shiina expressed his agreement.
    The communiqué also mentioned that "both sides advocate further developing contacts between politicians of the two countries" and "consulting from time to time on international issues of common concern."
    Kyodo News, in reporting the results of the Soviet-Japanese talks, said that Shiina "believes that the Soviet side is making considerable and earnest efforts to improve Japanese-Soviet relations." The news agency said that the reason why the Soviet Union is so enthusiastic about improving Soviet-Japanese relations is because "the Soviet Union has recently been actively launching a series of diplomatic activities to drive a wedge into the countries surrounding China."
    The situation revealed in the talks shows that Soviet-Japanese cooperation is a variant of Soviet-U.S. cooperation. Kyodo News reported that Gromyko told Shiina during the talks that "promoting the friendly development of Japanese-Soviet relations will not cause any damage to [Japan's] relations with third countries." Gromyko then further explained that "the so-called third countries refer to the Western powers." Japanese Acting Foreign Minister Takeo Fukuda relayed this to the Japanese Cabinet meeting on the 20th. Fukuda said that Gromyko's remarks indicated that "the Soviet attitude towards Japan has become different from the past." Fukuda pointed out that Gromyko's words were obviously taking into account the "Japan-U.S. security system," which means that the Soviet Union no longer demands "the withdrawal of American troops stationed in Japan." Kyodo News reported from Moscow on the 22nd that Shiina believed that Gromyko's remarks indicated that the Soviet Union's "policy towards Japan has undergone a tremendous change." "This indicates [the Soviet Union's] attitude of promoting peaceful coexistence on the premise of recognizing the Japan-U.S. security system. This is a major change in the Soviet Union."

### 苏日加紧勾结要干什么？  椎名访苏和苏日联合公报暴露了双方为美国“和谈”骗局效劳和联合反华的阴谋

    苏日加紧勾结要干什么？
    椎名访苏和苏日联合公报暴露了双方为美国“和谈”骗局效劳和联合反华的阴谋
    新华社二十三日讯  莫斯科消息：在苏联新领导加强同日本佐藤政府勾结声中，日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎应苏联政府的邀请，从一月十六日到二十二日对苏联进行了正式访问。
    据报道，椎名悦三郎会见了苏联领导人柯西金、波德戈尔内等人，同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在十九日和二十日举行了两次会谈，并且在二十二日签署了一项苏日联合公报。
    塔斯社二十二日在莫斯科公布的苏日联合公报说，“双方就进一步发展苏日关系的问题和双方关心的主要国际问题有益地交换了意见”，“双方对睦邻关系正在逐步发展和两国之间产生的问题正在得到解决，表示满意。”联合公报说，由于椎名和葛罗米柯“谈判得到顺利结束”，两国签订了苏日航空协定和一九六六年到一九七○年的长期贸易支付协定。双方还同意“尽快缔结苏日领事条约——关于缔约的会谈目前正在进行——并且考虑互设领事馆的问题。”
    共同社报道签订这两个协定仪式上的气氛时说，苏联官员们从四面八方向椎名外务大臣伸来了手，“就连平日总是表情严肃的葛罗米柯外长在这个时候也喜笑颜开，三次紧紧地握了椎名的手”。
    公报在谈到苏日双方关于越南问题的会谈结果时，不分是非、不谴责美国对越南的侵略，胡说什么双方“强调指出越南的事态是对和平的威胁”。这再次暴露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在越南问题的叛卖立场。据报道，椎名同葛罗米柯会谈中，曾积极充当美国“和谈”骗局的掮客，攻击越南民主共和国的四项主张，并且要求苏联发挥影响，促成美国的“和谈”骗局的实现。
    公报鼓吹双方认为有必要“加强联合国”，实现全面彻底裁军和缔结一项不扩散核武器的条约。据共同社透露，所有这些问题都是葛罗米柯主动提出，椎名表示同意的。
    公报还提到“双方主张进一步发展两国政治家之间的联系”，“不时就共同关心的国际问题进行磋商”。
    共同社在报道苏日会谈的结果时说，椎名“认为苏联方面为了改善日苏关系是在进行相当认真的努力”。这家通讯社说，苏联之所以如此热中改善苏日关系，这是因为“苏联最近正积极展开一系列的外交活动，要在中国的周围各国打入楔子。”
    会谈中透露的情况表明，苏日合作是苏美合作的一种变种。共同社报道说，葛罗米柯在同椎名会谈中告诉椎名，“增进日苏关系的友好发展，不会对（日本）同第三国的关系造成任何的损害”，葛罗米柯随后还进一步说明，“所谓第三国是指西方大国而言”。日本政府代理外务大臣福田赳夫在二十日当天就把这番话向日本内阁会议进行了传达。福田说，葛罗米柯这番话表明“苏联的对日态度已变得和过去不同”。福田指出，葛罗米柯的话显然是考虑到“日美安全体制”而说的，它意味着苏联已不再要求“驻在日本的美国军队撤退”。共同社二十二日从莫斯科报道  说，椎名认为葛罗米柯的这番话表明苏联的“对日政策已经发生了巨大的改变”。“这一点表明了（苏联）要在承认日美安全体制的前提下促进和平共处的态度。这是苏联的大变化。”
