    The year 1965 has passed, and whenever I look back on the past year with passion, my heart is always filled with a feeling that I cannot calm for a long time.
    In August last year, I gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. From that day on, I was prepared to dedicate everything I had to the revolution and to climbing the world's peaks. Therefore, I had a lot of confidence at that time. But the road to climbing the world's peaks is not smooth. In September, at the Second National Games, I did not jump to a good result, and I felt very uncomfortable. But when I read what Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "If people want to achieve success in their work, that is, to achieve the results they expect, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If it does not conform, they will fail in practice. After experiencing failure, people also learn from failure and correct their thinking to make it conform to the laws of the external world. People can turn failure into victory. The so-called 'failure is the mother of success' and 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit' is the reason." My heart suddenly brightened, and my confidence was rekindled. With the help of leaders and comrades, I summarized the reasons for not jumping well at the National Games, and finally found the key to the technique, and immediately boldly made improvements. Finally, in several competitions, I jumped to heights of 2.23 meters, 2.24 meters, and 2.25 meters, creating the best result in the world last year.
    Under the sunshine and rain of the Party and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, my political thought and professional skills have improved, just like a worker comrade said in a letter to me: "You are an athlete of socialist China, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought! You have no reason not to exceed 2.28 meters. I hope you will diligently study Chairman Mao's 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' to find a set of high jumping rules." Yes, I will definitely do as Chairman Mao instructed and use practical actions to answer the hopes of this class brother.
    In the new year, full of confidence, I will study and train even harder, conscientiously implement the training principles of "Three Froms and One Great," be determined not to fear hardship, and not to fear death, and be determined to create even better results.

    为祖国荣誉跳得更高
    一九六五年过去了，每当我满怀热情回顾过去的一年时，心中总感到久久不能平静。
    去年八月，我光荣地加入了中国共产党，从那一天起，我就准备着为革命、为攀登世界高峰，贡献自己的一切。因此，那时候的信心是很足的。但是攀登世界高峰的道路却是不平坦的。九月，在第二届全运会上，我没有跳出好成绩来，心里非常难受。但当我读到毛主席在《实践论》里所说的：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”心里豁然开朗，信心也重新鼓了起来，并在领导和同志们的帮助下，总结了全运会没跳好的原因，最后找到了技术的关键，而且马上大胆地作了改进。终于在几次比赛中跳出了二点二三米、二点二四米和二点二五米的高度，创造了去年世界最好成绩。
    在党的阳光雨露和在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我的政治思想和业务技术有了进步，就象一位工人同志在给我的来信中所说的那样：“你是社会主义中国的运动员，是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的！你没有任何理由不超过二米二八，希望你努力学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》，找出一套跳高的规律来。”是的，我一定按照毛主席指示的去做，用实际行动来回答这位阶级兄弟的希望。
    在新的一年里，充满信心，我要更加勤学苦练，认真贯彻“三从一大”的训练原则，做到一不怕苦，二不怕死，决心创造出更好的成绩。
