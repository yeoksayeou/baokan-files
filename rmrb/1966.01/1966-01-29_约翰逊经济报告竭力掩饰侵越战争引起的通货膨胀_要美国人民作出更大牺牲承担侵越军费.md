    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th – U.S. President Johnson, in his annual economic report submitted to Congress on the 27th, demanded that the American people make further sacrifices and prepare to bear the increasingly heavy burden of the war of aggression against Vietnam. He clamored, "I do not know what additional defense burdens the American economy will need to bear in 1966. But whatever the burden, it must be shouldered."

    Johnson used a large amount of space in the report to boast about the "achievements" of the American economy last year. However, he had to admit that "32 million Americans are still in poverty," "There are still too many elderly people, people in distressed rural areas, people in broken families, people who are uneducated or physically or mentally unsound or who are suffering from discrimination. Unemployment among blacks is still twice as high as among whites. The unemployment rate for teenagers is 13 percent, which means that too many teenagers are disappointed when they go from school to work."

    Johnson tried to conceal the fact that the continuous "escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam has intensified inflation in the United States. Although, based solely on official U.S. figures, consumer prices in the United States rose by 2 percent last year, the largest increase in seven years, Johnson tirelessly listed a number of commodities that had not increased in price or had even fallen slightly, in an attempt to prove that inflation did not exist.

    However, when talking about the impact of the war of aggression against Vietnam on the U.S. economy, Johnson could not help but admit that the Vietnam War "indeed added" a whole host of problems to the U.S. economy. He said, "The new needs of Vietnam make our task of maintaining price stability more difficult"; "It puts a particularly heavy burden on certain industries and creates many uncertainties for the government's fiscal planning and the private planning of the business community."

    Johnson said in the report that in order to cope with the ever-increasing expenses of the war of aggression against Vietnam, he has tried to "save" other government expenses "to meet the needs of defense," "drastically reduced or canceled" a batch of civilian spending plans, and has suggested amending tax procedures and increasing certain taxes. He clamored that if "additional defense needs" arise, he will "not hesitate to demand further fiscal action" to "limit private spending." In looking ahead to the U.S. economy in 1966, Johnson particularly emphasized that "the federal government's ever-increasing defense needs are an important new force in the economy."

    Johnson emphasized that "maintaining basic stability in costs and prices" is the "most serious task" facing the U.S. economy this year. He made no secret of the fact that in order to achieve this goal, he will further launch an attack on the living standards of the working class and deprive them of some of their remaining democratic rights. The report openly demanded that workers strictly follow the government's published "wage and price activity indicators" in wage matters in the future, and "abandon the freedom to act irresponsibly." He also revealed that he intends to ask Congress to pass a law to further restrict the right of workers to strike.

    When talking about international economic policy, the report emphasized that the U.S. goal this year is to strive to "achieve external balance" in order to "eliminate our remaining international balance of payments deficit and keep the dollar strong." But the methods Johnson proposed in the report to achieve this goal are still the old methods that have been implemented in recent years with little effect, such as "strengthening the management of capital outflows," striving to expand exports, restricting government dollar spending abroad, attracting foreign capital to the United States, and attracting foreign tourists to travel to the United States.

    The situation shows that with the war of aggression against Vietnam expanding day by day, U.S. military spending overseas is increasing and its foreign competitiveness is constantly weakening, Johnson's plan to eliminate the international balance of payments deficit is just wishful thinking. Preliminary data on U.S. foreign trade in 1965, released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 26th, showed that due to increased competition in foreign markets, U.S. exports increased by only 4 percent compared with 1964, while imports increased by 14 percent in the same period. Therefore, the total U.S. foreign trade surplus last year decreased by 25 percent compared with 1964. Western news agencies pointed out that this trend will definitely continue this year. The U.S. government has always relied on foreign trade surpluses to make up for a portion of the international balance of payments deficit; the shrinking foreign trade surplus is clearly very unfavorable to the U.S. international balance of payments.

    Johnson's whitewashed economic report has even aroused dissatisfaction among members of the U.S. Congress. Republican Senator Allott said, "To me, the (economic) picture is by no means as rosy as the president's message portrays." He pointed out that the United States' "obligations in Southeast Asia are far more serious than the American public knows."

    Another Republican Senator, Hickenlooper, believes that this report is not an economic report, but "mainly a political document." He said, "Certainly, for some time now, increasing inflation has been constantly undermining the purchasing power of American consumers."

### 约翰逊经济报告竭力掩饰侵越战争引起的通货膨胀  要美国人民作出更大牺牲承担侵越军费

    约翰逊经济报告竭力掩饰侵越战争引起的通货膨胀
    要美国人民作出更大牺牲承担侵越军费
    新华社二十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊在二十七日向国会提出的一年一度的经济报告中，要求美国人民进一步作出牺牲，准备承担起日益沉重的侵越战争负担。他叫嚷说，“我不知道，在一九六六年美国经济还需负担哪些额外的国防负担。但是不管是什么负担，都得挑起来。”
    约翰逊在报告中用了大量篇幅来吹嘘去年美国经济的“成就”。然而，他不得不承认，“三千二百万美国人仍然在贫困之中”，“仍然有太多的老年人、在衰退中的乡村地区中处境窘迫的人、破产家庭的人、没有受到教育或是身心不健全或是受到歧视之害的人。黑人中的失业人数仍然比白人多一倍。十多岁的少年的失业率达百分之十三，这意味着太多的少年从学校走向就业时感到失望。”
    约翰逊力图掩饰侵越战争不断“升级”引起美国国内通货膨胀加剧的事实。尽管仅仅根据美国官方公布的材料，美国的消费品价格在去年一年里上涨了百分之二，是七年来上涨幅度最大的一年；但是约翰逊在报告中却不厌其烦地列举了一部分一年来未涨价或甚至价格稍有下跌的商品，妄图证明通货膨胀并不存在。
    然而，在谈到侵越战争对美国经济的影响时，约翰逊也不能不承认，越南战争给美国经济“的确增添了”一大堆问题。他说，“越南的新需要使我们保持价格稳定的任务更加困难”；“它使某些工业承受特别沉重的负担，并且给政府的财政计划工作和企业界的私人计划工作带来许多不肯定的因素”。
    约翰逊在报告中谈到，为了应付侵越战争开支不断增加的情况，他已经尽量“节约”政府其他开支“来满足防务的需要”，“剧烈地削减或取消了”一批民用开支计划，并且已经建议修改纳税手续和增加某些捐税。他叫嚷说，如果“额外的防务需要”的话，他将“毫不犹豫地要求采取进一步的财政行动”，以“限制私人的开支”。在展望一九六六年的美国经济时，约翰逊特别强调“联邦政府不断增加的防务需要是经济中的一个重要的新力量。”
    约翰逊强调，“保持成本和价格的基本稳定”是今年美国经济面临的“最严重的任务”。他毫不讳言，为了达到这个目的，他将进一步向工人阶级的生活水平发动进攻和剥夺他们残留的某些民主权利。报告公然要求工人们今后在工资问题上严格按照政府公布的“工资和物价活动指标”行事，“放弃不负责任地行动的自由”。他还透露，他打算要求国会通过一项法律，进一步限制工人的罢工权利。
    谈到国际经济政策时，报告强调美国今年的目标是争取“达到对外的平衡”，以便“消除我们仍然有的国际收支逆差，使美元继续保持坚挺”。但是约翰逊在报告中提出的达到这个目标的方法仍然是那些近几年来早就在实行而收效不大的老办法，象“加强管理资金外流”、争取扩大出口、限制政府在国外的美元开支、吸引外国资本来美国、吸引外国游客到美国旅行等等。
    情况表明，在侵越战争日益扩大的今天，美国在海外的军费开支有增无减、而国外竞争能力又不断遭到削弱的情况下，约翰逊的消灭国际收支逆差的计划，只是痴心妄想。美国商务部二十六日公布的一九六五年美国对外贸易初步情况表明，由于国外市场竞争加剧，去年美国的出口只比一九六四年扩大了百分之四，而同期内进口却增加了百分之十四。因此去年美国对外贸易顺差总额比一九六四年减少了百分之二十五。西方通讯社指出，这种趋势在今年内肯定还将继续下去。美国政府一向依靠对外贸易顺差来弥补一部分国际收支赤字；外贸顺差的日益缩小对美国国际收支来说显然是十分不利的。
    约翰逊这个粉饰太平的经济报告甚至在美国国会议员中也引起了不满。共和党参议员艾洛特说，“对我来说，（经济）图景在任何方面都决不象总统咨文中所描绘的那样充满玫瑰色彩。”他指出，美国“在东南亚承担的义务远比美国公众所知道的更加严重得多”。
    另一名共和党参议员希肯卢珀认为，这个报告不是经济报告，“主要是一纸政治文件”。他说，“肯定的是，一个时期以来，日益增加的通货膨胀一直在不断损害着美国消费者的购买力”。
