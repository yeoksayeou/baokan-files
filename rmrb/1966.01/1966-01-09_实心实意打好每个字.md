    Conscientiously Type Every Single Character

    Each individual character may seem insignificant, but a document cannot be complete without any one of them. The same is true of the revolutionary cause; no single industry can be dispensed with.

    When I first started typing, I wasn't clear about the significance of typing in my mind. I always felt that sitting in a room typing all day could hardly be connected with revolution. Later, through studying Chairman Mao's works, I gradually raised my ideological awareness and clarified many revolutionary principles. I understood that today we are no longer working to find a job and make a living, but are engaging in revolution and building socialism. A document is certainly important, but it is composed of one character after another; each individual character may seem insignificant, but a document cannot be complete without any one of them. The same is true of the revolutionary cause; no single industry or profession can be dispensed with. Typing may seem ordinary, but it is an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause; conscientiously typing every single character can contribute to the revolution.

    After understanding this principle, I had the motivation to work. At the beginning, because I was not familiar with the work, I typed slowly, only four hundred words per hour, and made many mistakes. At that time, I thought: the revolution needs me to type well, how can I not do well? So, I studied and practiced diligently. If I wasn't familiar with the keyboard, I would keep the keyboard chart in my pocket and memorize it whenever I had time; if I wasn't proficient in typing, I would seize every opportunity to practice. Sometimes, when my eyes were blurred and my wrists were sore and aching, I would get up and take a walk around and then continue. In this way, after a period of time, my typing speed greatly improved, and the number of errors also decreased. Now I can type two thousand four or five hundred words per hour, and the error rate has also been reduced to about one in a thousand.

    Later, I also discovered that our keyboard arrangement was not reasonable enough, and the typewriter itself also had problems, which affected the rapid improvement of typing efficiency. So, I studied with everyone, rearranged the keyboard, and modified the typewriter, which finally greatly improved everyone's typing efficiency, and the documents typed were faster and better than before.

    Over the years, I have deeply realized that once a person connects their work with the revolutionary cause and clarifies that their work is for the revolution, they will become more and more enthusiastic. Now that the revolution needs me to type, I will conscientiously work by the typewriter for the rest of my life.

### 实心实意打好每个字

    实心实意打好每个字
    一个一个字看起来不起眼，可是在一份文件里缺少哪一个也不行。革命事业也是一样，缺哪一行业都不行
    刚开始打字时，我思想上不明确打字的意义。总觉得整天坐在屋子里打字，怎么能和革命联得上？后来通过学习毛主席著作，我逐渐地提高了思想觉悟，明确了不少革命的道理。我懂得了今天我们干工作不再是在找职业混饭吃，而是在革命，在建设社会主义。一份文件当然重要，可它是由一个字一个字组成的；一个一个的字看起来不起眼，可是在一份文件里缺少哪一个也不行。革命事业也是一样，缺少哪一行、哪一业都不行。打字看起来平凡，但它是革命事业不可缺少的一部分；实心实意地打好每一个字，就能为革命做出贡献。
    明白了这个道理后，工作就有了动力。开始时由于业务不熟，紧打慢打，一个小时才打四百多字，差错还很多。当时我就想：革命需要我打好字，打不好怎么能行，于是，我就勤学苦练。字盘不熟，我就把字盘表揣在兜里，有空就记；打字不熟练，就抓紧一切时间练。有时候，练得眼发花了，手腕又痛又酸，就起来遛两圈继续干。就这样，经过一个时期，打字速度有了很大提高，差错也少了。现在每小时能打二千四五百字了，差错率也减少到千分之一左右。
    以后，我又发现咱们的字盘排得不够合理，打字机本身也有毛病，影响了打字效率的迅速提高。于是我又和大伙一起研究，改排了字盘，改装了打字机，终于使大伙的打字效率大大提高了一步，打出的文件比过去又快又好。
    这些年来，我深深体会到：一个人一旦把自己的工作和革命事业联系起来，明确了自己的工作是为了革命，就会越干越起劲。现在革命需要我打字，我就实心实意地在打字机旁干它一辈子。
