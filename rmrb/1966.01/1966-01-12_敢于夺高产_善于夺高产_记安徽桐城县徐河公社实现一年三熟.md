    Daring to Seize High Yields, Good at Seizing High Yields
    ——A Record of Xuhe Commune, Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, Achieving Three Harvests a Year
    Xuhe is the first commune in Anhui Province to achieve a grain yield of one thousand jin per mu.
    Xuhe is also a commune in Anhui Province famous for planting double-cropping rice.
    Over eleven years, the people of Xuhe have transformed a disaster-prone polder area into a new polder area with stable and high grain yields. They have also spent eleven years adhering to production reforms, transforming the two-crop system of one wheat and one rice per year into a three-crop system centered on double-cropping rice. Currently, the double-cropping rice area in the entire commune accounts for more than 90% of the total paddy field area. Eleven years ago, Xuhe's grain yield per mu was only about four hundred jin. Last year, the grain yield per mu increased to over one thousand two hundred and twenty jin. Eleven years ago, the people of Xuhe often ate state relief grain. Last year, they sold more than five million jin of grain to the state.
    In Anhui, Xuhe is regarded as a pioneer in exploring higher grain yields. However, what is most worthy of learning from Xuhe is not a set of technical experiences in planting double-cropping rice, but rather the revolutionary spirit of establishing lofty ambitions and daring to seize high yields.
    Xuhe Commune is located on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, near Caizi Lake in Tongcheng County. The commune currently has over 12,000 mu of cultivated land and over 11,000 people. This is an inland river polder area, suitable for developing grain production. However, before liberation, it was a disaster-prone place. During the flood season, mountain torrents erupted, breaking the dikes and inundating the fields. And if it didn't rain for a month, the riverbeds dried up, and the fields and land were parched. Therefore, the farmers recall the situation at that time: Thinking of the polder area before liberation, it was truly pitiful. Three days of drought left it stranded, and three days of rain caused flooding under the eaves.
    
    Eradicating the Two Scourges of Floods and Poor Soil
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Xuhe took the road of organizing themselves. In 1955, advanced agricultural cooperatives were established, and in 1958, people's communes were established. From the time of collectivization, the people of Xuhe began to recognize the greatness of collective strength and established ambitious goals: We must overcome water and drought disasters, transform the dilapidated polder area and the barren land, and we must give play to the strength of the collective economy and produce more agricultural products to support the country's socialist construction.
    The scourges that hindered the development of production in Xuhe were floods and poor soil. Therefore, the first struggle of the organized people of Xuhe to change the world was to control water and improve the soil.
    Xuhe Commune is located in the area between the Bainian River and the Renxing River. There are thirty-seven small polders within its boundaries, as well as nineteen winding small flood drainage channels. Because the riverbeds of the Bainian River and the Renxing River were narrow, and the dikes were dilapidated, floods would cause dike breaches. In 1955, the people of Xuhe, together with brother teams upstream and downstream of these two rivers, concentrated their efforts with the help of the state to dredge the rivers and repair the dikes. They widened the two river channels, which were originally only 20 meters wide, to 60 meters and 80 meters respectively, increasing the flood discharge by two or three times. Along the river channels, they built dikes six meters high and more than 22,000 meters long. They also merged the thirty-seven small polders within the territory into one large polder. At the upstream and downstream dike sections, they built inlet and outlet sluice gates respectively, basically controlling the inflow and outflow of water. The people of Xuhe fought hard for two winter and spring seasons, ending the history of annual mountain floods breaking the dikes and inundating the fields.
    Then, they also managed the inner polder water system, transforming the original more than ten natural rivers in the inner polder, which were mainly for flood drainage, into channels mainly for irrigation.
    Since 1955, the total earth and stone work completed by the commune in building sluice gates, repairing dams, and digging canals, just in the inner river section, has reached more than 1.4 million cubic meters. In this way, rivers and canals are connected, and sluice gates and dams are distributed like chess pieces, gradually forming a complete irrigation system. Now, 90% of the paddy fields in the commune have achieved gravity irrigation.
    Except for the outer river structures, which received some help from the state, the rest was built by the people of Xuhe through self-reliance.
    While controlling water, the people of Xuhe launched a struggle to improve the soil.
    Xuhe's soil improvement task was equally arduous. Due to historical floods, there were large areas of cultivated land covered with river sand of varying thickness, or turned into low-lying land, becoming obstacles to agricultural production. The entire commune had more than 3,000 mu of sandy land, and more than 2,000 mu of blue clay and low-lying land. These barren lands accounted for half of the total cultivated land.
    The people of Xuhe fought a protracted war on soil improvement. Each year, they combined it with water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and land preparation, carrying it out continuously year after year. Through long-term struggle, all the barren soils have been transformed to varying degrees, and most have become fertile land.

    Exploring Objective Laws to Reform the Farming System
    While controlling water and improving soil, people also put their minds to reforming the farming system.
    Xuhe Commune has an average of only a little over one mu of cultivated land per person. Without more wasteland to reclaim, the members considered: Can we increase the multiple cropping index and plant three crops a year?
    In 1955, they conducted experiments on double-cropping rice in succession. The results showed that the 200 mu of double-cropping rice yielded an average of 580 jin per mu, an increase of 110 jin compared to planting one season of mid-season rice.
    Although the increase in yield of double-cropping rice was not large, it indicated a possibility. This overjoyed the people of Xuhe, who had been accustomed to planting one season of mid-season rice for generations. In 1956, they expanded double-cropping rice to 3,000 mu. In 1957, it was expanded to 7,000 mu. After some twists and turns, by 1961, it had been expanded to 8,500 mu. In 1965, double-cropping rice was expanded to account for more than 90% of the paddy fields. With the expansion of the double-cropping rice area, grain yields continued to increase. Now, a three-crop system of two seasons of rice and one season of wheat has finally formed in Xuhe Commune.
    For the people of Xuhe, this is a revolution.
    In areas north of the Yangtze River, it is not easy to plant double-cropping rice on a large scale and achieve three crops a year. The average annual temperature here is only 14.8 degrees Celsius, and the frost-free period is only 220 to 230 days. In such places, whether double-cropping rice can be promoted on a large scale is a question that many people doubt. Some people calculated and calculated: The 220 to 230 days of frost-free period are fixed. The early rice seedling and winter crop harvesting and planting will take 70 to 80 days. The growing period of early rice in the field requires more than 80 days, and late rice requires more than 100 days. In this way, to ensure that two seasons of rice grow and mature in a relatively short frost-free period, after calculating, it is indeed a difficult problem. But it did not stump the people of Xuhe.
    When the laws of nature are not grasped, people feel unfree; but once they grasp the laws, they will feel fully free in the long river of nature. Through repeated practice, the people of Xuhe gradually explored objective laws and finally seized freedom from nature in the matter of planting double-cropping rice. In a short period of time, they mastered the method of early rice seedling cultivation, found cold-resistant early rice varieties and late rice varieties with short growing periods, explored technical measures to promote early planting, early maturity, and early stubble removal of early rice, and summed up a set of experiences in rationally arranging labor and animal power to accelerate the speed of planting and harvesting.
    A powerful weapon in the process of promoting double-cropping rice in Xuhe Commune is mass scientific experimentation. Through experimental activities, gradually understanding the laws of nature, mastering the characteristics of various rice varieties, and mastering a set of new technologies and new experiences, so as to achieve invention, discovery, creation, and progress.
    Now, all 125 production teams in Xuhe Commune have scientific experiment groups, and one-third of the experimental work is relatively active. Each team is equipped with seed personnel, pest control personnel, and water management personnel, as well as seed fields, high-yield fields, and comparison fields.
    Although Xuhe Commune has achieved success in exploring the road to high grain yields, people know that their work is far behind the national advanced units. The task before them is how to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and strive for higher yields. Now, they are summarizing last year's production experience in order to formulate a revolutionary production plan for 1966.

    敢于夺高产　善于夺高产
    ——记安徽桐城县徐河公社实现一年三熟
    安徽省第一个粮食亩产千斤的公社是徐河。
    安徽省以种植双季稻出名的公社也是徐河。
    徐河人民用十一年的时间，把一个年年遭灾的破圩区，建设成为一个粮食稳产高产的新圩区；同时也用十一年的时间，坚持生产改革，把一年一麦一稻的两熟制，改革成为以双季稻为中心的一年三熟制。现在，全公社双季稻面积已经占水田总面积的百分之九十以上。十一年前，徐河的粮食亩产只有四百斤左右，去年粮食亩产上升到一千二百二十多斤。十一年前，徐河人民经常吃国家的救济粮，去年他们交售给国家的粮食达到五百多万斤。
    在安徽，徐河被看作是探索粮食高产再高产的先锋。但是，徐河最值得学习的，不是种植双季稻的一套技术经验，而是树立雄心壮志，敢于夺取高产的革命精神。
    徐河公社位于长江北岸桐城县菜子湖畔。全社现有一万二千多亩耕地，一万一千多人。这里是内河圩区，适宜发展粮食生产，但是解放前却是个多灾多难的地方，一到汛期，山洪暴发，破圩冲田；而一月不雨，又河道断流，田干地渴。因此，农民回忆那时的情况说：想起解放前，圩区真可怜，天旱三天搁了浅，落雨三天潦了檐。
    根治洪水劣土两个祸害
    解放后，徐河人民在党的领导下，走组织起来的道路。一九五五年，成立了高级农业社，一九五八年又成立了人民公社。从合作化的时候起，徐河人民开始认识到集体力量的伟大，并且立下了雄心壮志：一定要战胜水旱灾害，改造残破的圩区和瘠薄的土地，一定要发挥集体经济的力量，生产更多的农产品支援国家的社会主义建设。
    妨碍徐河人民发展生产的祸害，一是洪水，二是劣土。因此，组织起来的徐河人民，改天换地的第一场斗争就是治水改土。
    徐河公社处于柏年河和人形河之间的地区，境内有三十七个小圩，另外还有十九条弯曲的排洪小河道。由于柏年河和人形河的河床狭窄，堤圩残破，每逢山洪暴发，就会溃堤决口。一九五五年，徐河人民联合这两条河流上下游的兄弟社队，在国家的帮助下，集中力量挖河修堤。他们把两条原来只有二十米宽的河道，分别拓宽到六十米和八十米，排洪量加大两三倍。沿着河道，筑起六米高、总长二万二千多米的大堤。他们还把境内三十七个小圩，合并筑成一个大圩。在上下游堤段上，分别建筑了进水闸和出水闸，基本上控制了水的出入流向。徐河人民奋战两个冬春，就结束了年年山洪破堤冲田的历史。
    接着，他们又治理了内圩水系，把内圩原来以排洪为主的十多条天然河流，改造成为以灌溉为主的渠道。
    自一九五五年以来，全社筑闸、修坝、挖渠所完成的土石方，光是内河部分即达一百四十多万立方米。这样，河渠相通，闸坝棋布，一个完整的灌溉系统，逐步形成。现在，全社已有百分之九十的水田实现自流灌溉。
    这些工程除了外河建筑物部分得到国家的帮助外，其它都是徐河人民自力更生搞起来的。
    在治水的同时，徐河人民展开了改土的斗争。
    徐河的改土任务同样是艰巨的。由于历史上洪水为害，这里有大面积耕地，覆盖着厚度不同的河沙，或变成低洼地，成为农业增产的障碍。全公社有响沙地三千多亩，青岗泥地和低洼地两千多亩。这些贫瘠的土地占总耕地的一半。
    徐河人民在改土上，打的是持久战。每年结合兴修水利、积肥、整地等活动进行治理，年年不断。经过长期斗争，使所有贫瘠土壤得到不同程度的改造，大部分已经变成了沃土。
  探索客观规律改革耕作制度
    在治水改土的同时，人们还把脑筋用在耕作制度的改革上。
    徐河公社平均每人只有一亩一分多耕地。没有更多的荒地可以开垦，社员们就考虑：能不能提高复种指数，一年种三季庄稼？
    一九五五年，他们作了水稻两季连作的试验，结果连作的二百亩双季稻，平均亩产五百八十斤，比种一季中稻增产一百一十斤。
    双季稻增产的幅度虽然不大，但说明了一种可能性。这使世世代代习惯种一季中稻的徐河人民喜出望外。一九五六年，他们把双季稻扩大到三千亩。一九五七年扩大到七千亩。以后经过一段曲折，到一九六一年扩大到八千五百亩。一九六五年，双季稻扩大到占水田百分之九十以上。随着双季稻面积的扩大，粮食单产不断提高。现在，一个以两季水稻、一季麦子的一年三熟制度，终于在徐河公社形成。
    对徐河人民来说，这是一场革命。
    在长江以北地区，大面积种植双季稻，做到一年三熟，这不是一件容易的事。这里年平均气温只有摄氏十四点八度，无霜期不过二百二十天到二百三十天。在这样的地方，能不能大面积推广双季稻，这是很多人怀疑的问题。有人算了又算：二百二三十天的无霜期是硬的。早稻育秧和越冬作物收种这两头，要占七十天到八十天。早稻在大田的生长期要八十天以上，晚稻要一百天以上。这样，要保证两季水稻在比较短的无霜期中生长结实，算来算去，确实是个难题。但是它没有难住徐河人民。
    当自然界的规律没有被人掌握时，人们感到是不自由的；而一旦掌握了规律，在自然界的长河里，人们就会感到充分自由。徐河人民通过反复的实践，逐步摸索客观规律，终于在种双季稻这件事上从自然界中夺取了自由。他们在不长的时间里，早稻提前育秧的方法摸到了；耐寒的早稻品种和生长期短的晚稻品种找到了；促使早稻早栽、早熟、早腾茬口的技术措施摸索到了；合理安排劳畜力，加快种收速度的一套经验总结出来了。
    徐河公社在推广双季稻过程中，一个有力的武器就是群众性的科学实验。通过实验活动，逐步认识自然界的规律，摸到各种水稻品种的特性，掌握了一套新技术和新经验，从而做到有所发明，有所发现，有所创造，有所前进。
    现在，徐河公社的一百二十五个生产队，队队都有科学试验小组，其中三分之一的试验工作比较活跃。每个队配有种子员、治虫员和管水员，还有种子田、高产田和对比田。
    徐河公社虽然在探索粮食高产的道路上取得了成就，但是人们知道，他们的工作比起全国先进单位还差得很远。摆在他们面前的任务，是如何发扬不断革命精神，力争高产再高产。现在，他们正在总结去年的生产经验，以便为一九六六年制订出一个革命的生产计划。
