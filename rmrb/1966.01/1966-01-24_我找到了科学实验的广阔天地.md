    I Found the Vast World of Scientific Experiment
    Studying Chairman Mao's writings made me understand that living in a laboratory environment makes it impossible to grasp the laws of the fields
    As the New Year arrives, another year has passed.
    In the past year, through the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings and participation in rural practice, I have found a broad path towards scientific experimentation.
    In the past, there was a problem in my thinking that I could never figure out: conducting research in the laboratory is also a kind of practice, and it can also produce theory. Why is it necessary to go to the countryside to better integrate theory with practice? I have only now found the answer to this question.
    I started studying the tillering growth and decline patterns of rice in 1959. Initially, I conducted research in the fields of the commune, then in the small plots of the experimental farm, and later in pots, gradually reducing the scale. At first, there was some progress, but after two or three years, the working path became narrower and narrower. I felt very distressed, but I didn't know where the problem lay. After studying "On Practice," my mind was enlightened. I realized that the reason why my working path had become narrower and narrower in the past two years was mainly due to my increasing detachment from production practice and engaging in closed-door research. The topic was originally drawn from production practice, but I didn't return to production practice in time, and in the end, I didn't even know what problem I was trying to solve. Small-plot experiments and pot experiments are certainly also a kind of practice, but due to the small scale, our horizons were limited, and the knowledge gained from them was very limited. In the practice of the struggle for production, the situation is very different. It allows us to see all sides of things, not just one side. The rational understanding gained from these perceptual understandings is more comprehensive and more logical. Taking the tillering topic as an example, in the past, based on the results of small-scale experiments, I simply emphasized early development, believing that early development could lead to ear formation, ignoring the contradiction between early development and stable growth. Last year, from the practice of the model fields, I realized that simply emphasizing early development is one-sided. Early-developing tillers do not necessarily form ears. Whether or not ears are formed also depends on soil fertility, late-stage measures, climate conditions, and pest and disease situations. In general, it depends on whether the growth in the early and late stages is coordinated. These understandings cannot be obtained in small-plot and pot experiments. Chairman Mao said, "Whoever wants to know something has no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing." I now firmly believe that living in a laboratory environment makes it impossible to grasp the laws of the fields.
    In the past, I subjectively believed that the main problem in current agricultural production was the lack of fertilizer sources, and that having fertilizer would increase production, and that there were no major problems worth studying by plant physiologists. Or rather, agricultural production does not yet need the theory of plant physiology, and the conclusion drawn from this is naturally "there is no need to go to the front line of agricultural production again." Last year, after we went to the countryside to work on model fields, we found that the facts were far from the truth. Although the problem of fertilizer sources in agricultural production has not been completely solved, the rapid development of the chemical fertilizer industry in recent years has made the main contradiction of increasing production in some areas no longer the lack of fertilizer sources, but how to carry out rational fertilization based on variety, length of growing period, and amount of fertilizer sources. This issue was studied in plant physiology decades ago, but was gradually forgotten by following the research program of field - small plot - pot - test tube, and has not been resolved to this day. Last year, many late-season ears in the suburbs of Shanghai caused late maturity and reduced production due to improper fertilization. Production urgently requires us to provide a theory of rational fertilization. It can be seen that it is not that agriculture does not need the theory of plant physiology, but that plant physiology workers cannot come up with the theory that agriculture needs.
    Although we didn't spend a long time squatting in the model fields, we found a lot of scientific problems from production, many of which are fundamental. If these problems can be solved, it will not only play a great role in current production, but also promote plant physiology and soil science. Now we realize that there is an infinitely broad field of research in the model fields. We will never worry about not finding research topics here. The key is whether we dare to undertake them and dare to climb to the peak.
    In the new year, I am determined to strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's writings, continue to participate in the practice of model work, establish a world view of serving the people, master the ideological method of dialectical materialism, and make our work continue to move forward.

    我找到了科学实验的广阔天地
    学习毛主席著作，使我懂得了生活在实验室的环境中，要想掌握大田的规律是不可能的
    新春到来，又是一年过去了。
    在过去的一年中，我通过活学活用毛主席著作和参加农村的实践，找到了一条通向科学实验的广阔道路。
    过去我的思想上有一个问题一直搞不通：在实验室里搞研究也是一种实践，也可以出理论，为什么一定要到农村去才能更好地使理论联系实际？这个问题现在才找到了答案。
    我从一九五九年就开始研究水稻分蘖消长规律。起初在公社的大田里做研究，后来在试验场的小区里做，再后来在盆子里做，越做规模越小。起初还有些进展，两三年后工作路子越来越窄，自己心里很苦闷，但不知道问题的症结在哪里。学习《实践论》后，思想上开了窍，认识到前两年工作路子越走越窄，主要是由于越来越脱离了生产实际，闭门造车。原是从生产实践中抓来的课题，没有及时回到生产实际中去，最后连自己也不知道要解决什么问题。小区试验和盆栽试验固然也是一种实践，但由于规模的狭小，限制了我们的眼界，从中得到的知识有很大局限性。在生产斗争的实践中则情况大不相同，它可以使我们看到事物的各个侧面，而不只是一面。从这些感性认识进而得到的理性认识，是比较全面、比较合乎逻辑的。拿分蘖这个课题来说，过去我根据小规模试验的结果，单纯强调早发，认定早发就可以成穗，忽视了早发与稳长之间的矛盾，去年从样板田的实践中体会到，单纯强调早发是片面的，早发的分蘖不一定成穗，成穗与否还决定于土壤肥力、后期措施、气候条件和病虫情况等。总的来说，是决定于前后期生长是否协调。这些认识，在小区和盆栽试验中是得不到的。毛主席说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”我现在坚决相信，生活在实验室的环境中，要想掌握大田的规律是不可能的。
    过去我曾经主观地认为，目前农业生产中的主要问题就是肥源不足，有肥就能增产，没有什么重大问题值得植物生理学者进行研究。或者说，农业生产还用不上植物生理的理论，由此而得出的结论自然就是“没有必要再到农业生产第一线去。”去年我们到农村搞样板田之后，发现事实远非如此。农业生产中的肥源问题虽然还没有完全解决，但这几年化肥工业大发展，使得有些地区增产的主要矛盾不再是肥源不足，而是如何根据品种、生育期长短、肥源多少，进行合理施肥的问题。这个问题在植物生理学上几十年以前虽曾研究过，后来循着大田——小区——盆子——试管的研究程序而被逐渐遗忘了，至今并没有解决。去年上海郊区的后季穗，有不少因为施肥不当而造成迟熟减产，生产上迫切要求我们提供合理施肥的理论。可见，不是农业用不上植物生理的理论，而是植物生理学工作者拿不出农业所需要的理论。
    虽然我们蹲点搞样板田的时间不长，但从生产中发现的科学问题可真不少，其中有许多是带根本性的。如能解决这些问题，不但对当前生产可以起很大的作用，而且对植物生理学和土壤学均将有所促进。现在我们认识到，样板田中有无限广阔的研究领域，在这里决不愁找不到研究课题，关键看我们敢不敢承担，敢不敢去攀登高峰。
    在新的一年里，我决心加强学习毛主席著作，继续参加样板工作的实践，树立为人民服务的世界观，掌握辩证唯物主义的思想方法，使我们的工作不断前进。
