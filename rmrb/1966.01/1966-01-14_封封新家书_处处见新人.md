    New Letters from Home, New People Everywhere
    When hundreds of thousands of migrant workers leave their hometowns to work selflessly on the Hai River construction site, their families send letters of greeting. However, these are not ordinary letters of well-being, but enthusiastic support and encouragement for their relatives. From them, we can see what the peasants are thinking and most concerned about today....
    Editor
    You should help Auntie Landlord with things
    Changze:
    I received your letter and know that you arrived safely at the Hai River construction site; I know that you and your comrades are united and helping each other, and I also heard that you often help Auntie Landlord with chores. I am very happy to hear these good things.
    I hope you work there wholeheartedly and don't worry about home. I ask you to complete the tasks assigned to you by the Party on time. I also want to tell you, if Auntie Landlord has anything you can help with, try your best to help her.
    The team takes care of things at home. When the cabbage was distributed, the team even lent a small cart to transport it. When planting wheat, the team also let Guanghai come to help. It was planted in one day with watering, and the seedlings are growing very well.
    You don't need to worry about my health. I will take good care of our elders and children at home, and I promise to be even more careful than when you were at home, so please rest assured.
              Wishing you
      Good health
                  Xiuying (Guan County)
    Why was our door skipped over?
    Lian Wenu:
    You have been digging the river for eight or nine days, and everything is fine at home. I hope you don't worry.
    On the 24th, Director Li of the commune wrote good news to the parents of Red Flag Team Leaders and Five-Good Migrant Workers. The brigade club delivered them to each household with gongs and drums and singing. In the evening, the brigade held a glorious meeting for the parents of Five-Good Migrant Workers. Lianwen, to be honest, it stimulated my brain a lot. I thought that every time you dug the river and built the dike, you could be a model and win awards, and you were no worse than others at doing any work at home. I thought you would definitely be named a Five-Good Migrant Worker, but the people who delivered the good news skipped our door. Why didn't you become a Five-Good Migrant Worker?
    I am a production team leader, working actively to become a Five-Good Cadre. You are a young man, strong and energetic, you must do your best to dig the river and must become a Five-Good Migrant Worker, striving for a "father and son red."
                Father Bao Lun (Linxi County)
    Editor's note: Comrade Lianwen firmly gave up his Five-Good award to others during the first evaluation. After receiving this letter, he worked even harder and became the first advanced migrant worker in Linxi County to create high work efficiency.
      This is my good son!
    Jinshun, my son:
    You have been gone for many days, and it would be false to say I don't miss you, but things at home are even more taken care of than when you were here. The day after you left, our village branch secretary came to our house to ask if there were any difficulties with food, fuel, or supplies. From that day on, I don't know who carries water, and I don't know who delivers the distributed items and firewood to our house and puts them neatly. I think this must be done by the cadres! Jinshun, my son, although your father is old and weak, I still actively participate in the team's labor. You are young and strong, you must be a river-harnessing hero and win glory for me. This is my good son. I won't say more.
              Father Yuan Lie (Linxi County)
    Let's compare the front and rear lines
    Derong:
    It's been a long time since we met. I want to tell you good news. I was also named a Five-Good Commune Member this time. I think you will be even happier than I am. Rest assured there, your home is also my home. I have already asked my younger brother to go there and said there were no difficulties...
    Let's talk about it here, and we'll talk in detail when you come back. Finally, I request that you be sure to consolidate the Five-Good, and let's compare the front and rear lines! With best wishes,
                    Yanfang (Linxi County)

### 封封新家书　处处见新人

    封封新家书　处处见新人
    当几十万民工远离故乡在海河工地上忘我劳动的时候，他们的家人寄来了问候信。但是，这并不是一些普普通通的平安家书，而是对自己亲属的热情支持和鼓舞。从中可以看到农民们今天所想的和最关心的是什么……。
    编　者
    你要帮助房东大娘办事情长泽：
    你的来信收到了，知道你一路平安到达了海河工地；知道你和同志们团结友爱互相帮助，还听到你常常帮助房东大娘忙些杂活。我听到这些好事，心里真是高兴极了。
    我希望你在那里一心一意的工作，不要挂念家里，我要求你按时完成党交给你的任务。我还要告诉你，房东大娘有什么事，你能办得了的，尽量替大娘去办。
    家里的事情有队里照顾，分了白菜队里还特意借给小车运，种麦时队里还让光海来帮忙，连浇水一天就种上了，苗出得很好。
    我的身体你更不要挂念。我在家里好好对待咱们的老人和孩子，保证比你在家里还要加倍细心，请你放心。
              祝你
      身体健康
                  秀　英（固安县）
    为啥把咱家门口隔过？连文吾儿：
    你挖河走了有八九天了，家里一切都很好，希儿不要挂念。
    二十四日由公社李社长给红旗车长和五好民工的家长都写来喜报，由大队俱乐部打着锣鼓唱着歌送到各户，晚上大队又召开了五好民工家长的光荣会。连文，说真的，对我脑子的刺激很大，我想到你每次挖河打堤都能当模范得奖状，在家干什么活也不比别人差，认为你一定能评上五好民工，不料想送喜报的把咱的门口隔过去，你为什么没当上五好民工呢？
    我是个生产队长，积极的工作，争取当上五好干部。你是个青年，身强力壮，要为挖河尽最大努力，一定要当上五好民工，争个父子红。
                父　鲍　伦（临西县）
    编者注：连文同志在第一次评五好时，他坚决让给别人。收到这封信后，他干得更好了，成为临西县第一个创造了高工效的先进民工。
      这才是我的好儿子金顺吾儿：
    你走了好多天，说不想你是假的，可是咱家里的事儿，比你在家还周全得多。打你走后的第二天，咱村支书就来咱家一趟，问吃的烧的用的有没有难处。从那天起，不知有谁给担水，分的东西和烧柴不知是谁送到咱家来，还放的整整齐齐，我想这一定是干部们给做的吧！金顺吾儿，你爹我虽年迈力衰，还积极参加队的劳动，你年青力壮，一定当个治河英雄为我争光，这才是我的好儿子。别不多谈
              父　袁　烈（临西县）
    咱俩个前后方比一比德荣：
    长时间没有见面了，我向你提个好事，这次评比五好，我也当上了五好社员，恐怕你听到比我还高兴。你在那里放心吧，你的家也是我的家，我已叫我弟弟去了一趟，说没有什么困难，……
    就谈到这里吧，等你回来再细谈，最后要求，千万把五好巩固住，咱俩个前后方比一比！此致握手礼
                    延　芳（临西县）
