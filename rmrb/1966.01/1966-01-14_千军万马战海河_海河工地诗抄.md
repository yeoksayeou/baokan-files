Edition: 6

Editor's Note: On October 15, 1965, the first phase of Hebei Province's fundamental Hai River control project commenced. A 480,000-strong army of river workers from seven prefectures in Hebei Province, with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping, braved the cold weather and fought on the 900-kilometer-long Heilonggang drainage construction site. This project is expected to dredge and excavate nine key river channels and thirty-five tributaries during last winter and this spring. After the completion of the project, it can basically free 1.6 million mu of farmland in thirty-one counties and cities of Hebei Province from waterlogging disasters. By December 20th last year, all the migrant workers had withdrawn from the construction site and returned to their homes, completing the winter project plan ahead of schedule. This is a great mass production struggle by the people of Hebei Province in response to Chairman Mao's call to "definitely control the Hai River". During the construction period, the revolutionary people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, worked selflessly and enthusiastically, creating many miracles in the production struggle, and at the same time, many new people and new deeds shining with socialist glory emerged. Before departing, the migrant workers conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's great call; they carried Chairman Mao's works in their arms to the construction site. They learned from the People's Liberation Army's Three-Eight Style of work, sweeping courtyards, carrying water, and picking up firewood for their landlords… The villagers also cherished and cared for the migrant workers like they would their own children. This is a revolutionary water conservancy construction army organized by farmers, and this is an extremely moving picture of class friendship. All of this is the result of Chairman Mao's great call to "definitely control the Hai River" deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the vast number of farmers studying Chairman Mao's works and giving prominence to politics. We have collected some amateur creations and other materials from the Hai River construction site. Through these mass creations and materials, we can vividly see some aspects of the boiling construction site, and also see how profound changes are taking place in the mental outlook of today's farmers, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.
    A Mighty Army Battles the Hai River
    —Poems from the Hai River Construction Site
    Our Thoughts He Knows
    Chairman Mao issued the call,
    Our thoughts he knows.
    A mighty army battles the Hai River,
    For generations of happiness we sow!

    Four Treasures of River Control Workers
    River control workers have four treasures,
    Chairman Mao's works are the first to be brought,
    Along with wheelbarrows, shovels, and picks.
    These four treasures are indispensable,
    Chairman Mao's works are the most important.
    Keeping them close increases awareness,
    Studying and applying them flexibly yields results.
    Pushing the cart without feeling tired,
    A thousand catties load in one go,
    Shovels and picks fly in a great competition,
    Make great contributions to fundamentally control the Hai River.
          [Ji County Chang Shu]

    Little Red Flag
    "Must control the Hai River,"
    The bright red flag is planted on the cart,
    Golden characters shine brightly,
    Leading me to set off for Heilonggang.
    When the migrant workers see the little red flag,
    Their whole body is filled with endless strength,
    When "Black Dragon" sees the little red flag,
    It trembles all over in fright!
        [Jiaohe County Yu Feng]
    We Must Lock the Hai River
    Chairman Mao proposed: "Must control the Hai River"
    Like a spring breeze,
    Blowing through our hearts,
    Warming us from head to toe,
    A fire ignited in our hearts.
    Hai River—the source of drought and alkali,
    Hai River—the disaster den of floods.
    For the sake of future generations,
    We must lock the Hai River.
        [Jiaohe County Bao Shan]
    Iron Feet Standing at the Forefront
    "Must control the Hai River!"
    Chairman Mao wielded his pen to write seven characters,
    How much emotion, how much heat,
    Pouring on the commune members' hearts, golden flowers bloom!
    We take the lead in controlling the Hai River,
    We must catch the black dragon monster in Heilonggang!
    Thousands of carrying poles and ten thousand shovels,
    Weave golden and silver belts for the motherland.
    Steel shovels draw out pearl springs,
    The revolutionary burden is picked up.
    Subduing dragons and tigers to control the Hai River,
    Iron feet standing at the forefront!
      [Huanghua County Liu Xiaofang]

    Warrior and Warhorse
    The warrior and warhorse are in perfect harmony,
    They are not a natural pair,
    The warrior tamed the fierce horse.
    The Hai River is like a fierce horse on the Hebei Plain,
    Look at the future Hai River,
    It will forever be tamed by the people of Hebei!

    I am a Person of Hebei
    I am a person of Hebei,
    The Hai River is the horse of Hebei,
    I will use both arms,
    To finally tame it!
      [Lincheng County Ji Shijun]

    Heroes, Which One is a Hero?
    Which one is a hero,
    Which one is a good man!?
    The wheelbarrow is the witness,
    The earthwork is the referee.
        [Jiaohe County Migrant Worker]
    I Say the North Wind is Not Scary
    People say the north wind is domineering,
    I say the north wind is not scary,
    Labor enthusiasm is like a raging fire,
    Enthusiasm soaring to the sky, the fire is even bigger.
    Even icebergs and snow seas,
    Will melt if they touch it.
    The determination to control the Hai River is firm,
    The howling north wind is nothing.
        [Shen County Liu Zhiguang]
    Father Sent a Shovel
    The young man had only been working for three days,
    His father sent a shovel.
    The son said it was rusty and not easy to use,
    The father said the meaning was extraordinary:
    In the past, Xu Chunlin forced Dad,
   (Note) To use it to dig the canal bank,
    The canal burst open,
    The flood inundated Jiaohe County.
    Today, I want you to use this shovel,
    To benefit the people on the front line,
    Tame the Hai River and subdue the disaster demon,
    Build a new socialist country.
    (Note) Xu Chunlin was the puppet county magistrate of Jiaohe during the Kuomintang rule. In 1945, in order to protect his ruling position, he dug the dike and flooded our army, bringing great disasters to the people of Jiaohe.
   [Jiaohe County Bao Shan]
    A Thousand Miles of Dams are Built
    Red flags flutter on the Fudong River,
    Heroes come from all directions.
    Carts and horses travel back and forth like the sea,
    Setting up camp on the spot.
    Look at the heart of the river,
    Silver shovels dance with a surging sound,
    The wheels fly up to the dam.
    Both hands open up the road to happiness,
    Stepping on thousands of difficulties and dangers.
    Listen to the sound, learn from Daqing, catch up with Dazhai,
    Control the Hai River, move mountains and create seas,
    Compare, learn, catch up, and surpass, strive for the upstream,
    Bold words shake the sky.
    Remember the past, the tears of the people on both banks become the sea,
    Nine years of disaster in ten years.
    Wife and children separated, helpless,
    Bankrupt and fled outside the pass.
    Look at today, heroic sons and daughters control the Hai River,
    A thousand miles of dams are built.
    Digging away thousands of years of blood and tears,
    Bringing in ten thousand years of new era.
    [Wuyi County Ding Yi]
    Changed My Strange Temper
    My name is Hutuo River,
    Passing through thousands of mountains and valleys,
    I have had a strange temper since ancient times,
    Roaring loudly, the world breaks apart,
    Can make big trees uprooted,
    Can turn good fields into wasteland.
    Since the Communist Party came,
    Chairman Mao called for controlling the disaster,
    Gangnan Huangbi built a reservoir,
    The dam was built to block me.
    Chairman Mao smiled at me,
    The smile made me blush and feel convinced,
    Lowering my head to think,
    Submitting my guarantee,
    In the future, I will make great contributions,
    Blocking floods and storing water, exerting my strength.
      [Pingshan County Cao Qiu Xi]

    Shelter Entertainment
    Forming a circle in the moonlight,
    Beating drums and gongs happily,
    What are they performing tonight?
    《Ode to the River Control Heroes》.
    Xiao Li claps his hands as clapper,
    Da Zhuang beats the pot, adding a bit of freshness,
    River control dance is beautifully danced,
    The battle song of the construction site shakes the sky.
    Who is she playing the girl?
    "Carrying Pole King" Li Xiuluan;
    Who is the model?
    Model cook on the construction site.
      [Hengshui County Wang Lanzhi]

    There is a Dear Mother Here Too
    Just about to drink a bowl of cool water,
    The aunt snatched the bowl:
    "Drinking cold water will hurt your stomach,
    There is hot tea in the pot.
    If you don't remember again,
    Be careful, I'll smack you!"
    "Be careful, I'll smack you",
    Mom often said this at home,
    I travel around to build water conservancy,
    There is a dear mother here too.
        [Wuyi County Wang Shouqian]

    Difficult to Invite Even with a Lantern
    Listen to the Qing migrants,
    You are good migrants of Chairman Mao,
    Come to our county from a hundred miles away,
    Put down your luggage and start working,
    Cleaning the toilet and sweeping the streets,
    Pushing carts and carrying poles is even more proactive,
    Courteous to people and disciplined,
    Even more thoughtful in speaking and doing things,
    Where can we find such people?
    Difficult to invite even with a lantern.
   [All Commune Members of Gou Lu Dao Village, Jiaohe County]
      [Original Illustration by Miao Di]
    Farewell
    We are about to leave the village,
    Always hearing the villagers' caring voices,
    Fighting hard for two months like one day,
    Reluctant to part with the elders and brothers,
    Shaking hands to say goodbye, what to say,
    I hope we can all increase our efforts,
    We will meet again next March,
    To fundamentally control drought and flood and change to a new look.
   [Shen County Fu Changbo]
    County Chief Cui Pounds
    The battle drums of the Jiaohe construction site sound,
    The young men fight hard on the dam!
    Cadres and masses pound the dam,
    The one leading the pounding is our County Chief Cui.
   [Jiaohe County Migrant Worker]
    The Regiment Commander Pushes the Cart, the Political Commissar Pulls
    The regiment commander pushes the cart, the political commissar pulls,
    Sweat waters the flowers of victory,
    Even with them added,
    The progress has leaped like a thousand-mile horse.
    [Wuyi County Wang Shouqian]
    County Chief Liu Came to Our Company
    County Chief Liu came to our company,
    Every migrant worker likes him,
    Taking the lead in pulling the cart in front,
    We pack quickly and try to catch up.
    County Chief Liu came to our company,
    And ate the same bucket of rice with us,
    Asking about both the length and the shortcomings,
    Deeply moved, speechless.
    Only feel the whole body is full of strength,
    Overcoming difficulties, the heart is even more firm,
    Must work to the end on the construction site,
    Must make the Hai River change to a new day!
                  [Ji County Jin Tian]

### 千军万马战海河——海河工地诗抄

1966-01-14
第6版()
专栏：

    编者按：一九六五年十月十五日，河北省根治海河的第一期工程开工了。来自河北省七个专区的四十八万治河大军，以万马奔腾之势，不畏天寒地冻，战斗在绵延九百公里长的黑龙港排水工地上。这一工程，预计在去冬今春，疏浚和开挖九条骨干河道、三十五条支流河道。工程完成后，可以使河北省三十一个县市的一千六百万亩耕地基本免除沥涝灾害。到去年十二月二十日，全体民工已撤离工地，返回家园，提前完成了去冬工程计划。这是河北省人民响应毛主席“一定要根治海河”的号召，进行的一次伟大的群众性的生产斗争。在施工期间，以毛泽东思想武装的革命人民，意气风发，忘我劳动，在生产斗争中创造了许多奇迹，同时出现了许多闪耀着社会主义光芒的新人新事。民工们出发以前，认真学习了毛主席的伟大号召；怀里揣着毛主席的著作来到工地。他们学习解放军的三八作风，给住地房东扫院、担水、拾柴……。住地村民也象热爱自己的子弟一样，爱护和关心民工们。这是一支以农民组织起来的革命化的兴修水利的民工大军，这是一幅极为动人的阶级友爱的图画。这一切，是毛主席的“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召深入人心，广大农民大学毛主席著作，突出政治的结果。我们从海河工地上搜集了一部分民工的业余创作和其他材料，通过这些群众创作和材料，可以生动地看到沸腾的工地上的一些侧面，也可以看到今天的农民们，在毛泽东思想哺育下，他们的精神面貌起着多么深刻的变化。
    千军万马战海河
    ——海河工地诗抄咱们的心思他知道毛主席呀发号召，咱们的心思他知道。千军万马战海河，万代幸福我们造！
  治河民工四件宝治河民工有四件宝，毛主席著作先带好，还有小车、锨和镐。四件宝啊不可少，毛主席著作最重要。带在身边觉悟高，活学活用见工效。推起车来不知累，千斤担子一溜跑，锨飞镐舞大竞赛，根治海河立功劳。
          〔冀县　常树〕
  小红旗
  “一定要根治海河”，鲜红的小旗插车上，金色的字体放光芒，领我出发到黑龙港。民工们看到小红旗，浑身的力气用不完，“黑龙”见到小红旗，吓得浑身打哆嗦！
        〔交河县　玉峰〕我们要把海河锁毛主席提出：“一定要根治海河”就象春风，从我们心里吹过，吹得浑身暖烘烘，心里燃起一团火。海河——旱、碱的根源，海河——洪涝的灾窝。为了子孙万代福，我们要把海河锁。
        〔交河县　宝山〕铁脚站在最前排“一定要根治海河”！毛主席挥笔写下七个字，多少情，多少热，浇得社员心里金花开！根治海河咱打头，黑龙港要捉黑龙怪！千条扁担万把锨，给祖国织出条条金银带。钢锨引出珍珠泉，革命的担子挑起来。降龙伏虎治海河，铁脚站在最前排！
      〔黄骅县　刘小放〕
    勇士和战马勇士和战马十分融洽，他们并不是天生的一对，是勇士驯服了烈马。海河就是河北平原上的烈马，请看未来的海河，将永远驯服在河北人民手下！
    我是河北人我是河北的人，海河是河北的马，我要用两臂，最后驯服它！
      〔临城县　纪诗隽〕
    英雄好汉哪个是英雄，哪个是好汉！？小车是见证，土方是裁判。
        〔交河县　民工〕我说北风不可怕人说北风风里霸，我说北风不可怕，劳动热情似烈火，干劲冲天火更大。就是冰山和雪海，要他碰上也融化。根治海河决心坚，北风呼啸不算啥。
        〔深县　刘志广〕父亲送来一张锨小伙子上工才三天，父亲送来一张锨。儿说有锈不好使，爹说意义不一般：过去徐春林逼着爹，
  （注）用它扒了运河岸，运河滚滚决了口，大水灌了交河县。今天要你用这张锨，为民造福在前线，驯服海河降灾魔，建设社会主义新江山。
    （注）徐春林是国民党统治时期交河伪县长，一九四五年为了保住自己的统治地位，扒堤淹我军，给交河人民带来了莫大的灾害。
   〔交河县　宝山〕千里大坝修起来滏东河上红旗摆，四面八方英雄来。车马往返人似海，就地安营来扎寨。看河心，银锨飞舞声澎湃，车飞轮转坝上来。双手开辟幸福路，千难万险脚下踩。听声音，学大庆，赶大寨，根治海河，移山造海，比学赶超争上游，豪言壮语震天外。忆往日，两岸人民泪成海，十个年头九年灾。妻离子散无奈何，倾家荡产逃关外。看今朝，英雄健儿治海河，千里大坝修起来。挖走了千年血泪史，载来了万年新时代。
    〔武邑县　丁一〕改了我的怪脾气我的名叫滹沱河，千山万谷都经过，自古有个怪脾气，大吼一声天地破，能使大树连根拔，能把良田变荒窝。自从来了共产党，主席号召治祸殃，岗南黄壁建水库，大坝建成把我挡。毛主席向我微微笑，笑得我脸红心里服，低下头来想一想，递上我的保证书，今后我要立大功，拦洪蓄水把力出。
      〔平山县　曹秋喜〕
    工棚联欢月亮地里围成圈，敲锣打鼓闹得欢，今晚演的是什么？《治河英雄赞》。小李拍掌当竹板，大壮敲盆点儿鲜，治河舞蹈跳得美，工地战歌声震天。扮演姑娘的她是谁？“扁担王”李秀鸾；当模范的是哪一个？工地模范炊事员。
      〔衡水县　王兰志〕
  这里也有亲妈妈
  打碗凉水正要喝，
  大妈劈手把碗夺：
  “喝了凉水肚子疼，
  壶里有热茶。
  再要不记着，
  小心巴掌打！”
  “小心巴掌打”，
  在家妈常说这话，
  我修水利走四方，
  这里也有亲妈妈。
        〔武邑县　王守谦〕
  提着灯笼也难请到
  武清民工请是听，
  您是毛主席的好民工，
  不远百里来我县，
  放下行李就劳动，
  又出厕所又扫街，
  推车担挑更主动，
  对人礼貌纪律好，
  说话做事更周到，
  哪里找来哪里请？
  提着灯笼也难请到。〔交河县苟鲁道村全体社员〕
      本版插图　苗地
    告　辞我们出村将欲行，总闻乡亲照顾声，奋战两月如一日，难舍父老众弟兄，握手告别说什么，但愿彼此干劲增，来年三月重相会，根治旱涝换新容。
   〔深县　孚昌波〕崔县长砸夯交河工地战鼓响，小伙子奋战大堤上！干群行夯在大坝，领夯的是咱崔县长。
   〔交河县民工〕团长推车政委拉团长推车政委拉，汗水浇开胜利花，别看添上他们俩，进度跨上千里马。
    〔武邑县　王守谦〕刘县长来到咱们连刘县长来到咱们连，个个民工都喜欢，带头拉车在前走，咱们紧装快追赶。刘县长来到咱们连，和咱同吃一桶饭，既问长来又问短，内心感动无话言。只觉浑身力量大，战胜困难心更坚，要在工地干到底，定叫海河变新天！
