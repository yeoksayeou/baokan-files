    “For the people” is a brilliant crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong always taught us to serve the people wholeheartedly and place the interests of the people above all else. This is the starting point for all of the Party's work. During which period, in which region, did we execute Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction more completely and more consciously? Our work made great progress and great developments. Conversely, our work might have experienced problems of one kind or another.

    The news report "Wholeheartedly for the People, Relying on the People for Everything," published in today's newspaper, illustrates that the Yu Jiang County Committee's thought of "for the people" is conscious and their actions are resolute. They grasped class struggle with one hand and the two major tasks of production and disease treatment with the other, leading the masses of the people throughout the county, relying on their own efforts, struggling arduously, and persisting for fifteen years, finally sending away the two plagues of disease and poverty. The former epidemic area is now a center of stable and high yield; the former schistosomiasis patients are now skilled laborers. A poverty-stricken and disease-ridden low-yield county has been transformed into an advanced county in the style of Dazhai.

    For the people is concrete, not abstract.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "All correct tasks, policies, and work styles are in accordance with the demands of the masses at the time and place, and are connected with the masses; all incorrect tasks, policies, and work styles are not in accordance with the demands of the masses at the time and place, and are divorced from the masses." This is the premise for us to correctly solve the problem of "for the people."

    We often say that we should act according to the needs and willingness of the masses. Needs are the needs of the people at the time and place; willingness is the willingness of the people at the time and place. Without the conditions of "at the time and place," needs and willingness have no foothold. In order to achieve this, Party organizations at all levels must deeply understand the demands of the local masses, implement the Party and the country's line, principles, and policies in accordance with local conditions and the times, and mobilize the masses to realize the tasks put forward by the Party. The people of Yu Jiang County have been plagued by schistosomiasis for generations, with some villages having almost no inhabitants; they have been threatened by drought for generations and lived in extreme poverty. In Yu Jiang County, serving the people requires leading the people of Yu Jiang to concentrate their efforts on eliminating schistosomiasis and changing the face of drought and low yield. The Yu Jiang County Committee consciously did this, reflecting the vital interests of the people of Yu Jiang and indeed obtained the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the county.

    Marxists bear two responsibilities: one is the actual task at the time and place, and the other is the grand ideal of the future. Only by completing the actual task at the time and place as thoroughly as possible can we have a basis and foundation to develop to the stage of the grand ideal of the future. As long as we can serve the people wholeheartedly according to the interests of the masses at the time and place, we can continuously raise the awareness of the people, enable them to understand the higher tasks put forward by the Party from these things, sincerely support the Party and the government, fully mobilize the masses, and truly voluntarily and consciously contribute all their strength to realize the long-term revolutionary ideals.

    We are Marxists-Leninists and have always believed that the masses must rely on themselves to liberate themselves, and we oppose any point of view and practice of taking everything into our own hands and bestowing favors. Revolution and construction must rely on the masses, self-reliance, and everyone working together. We emphasize highlighting politics and strengthening ideological education work precisely to raise the awareness of the masses, make them aware of their own interests, and voluntarily and consciously struggle for their own interests under the leadership of our Party.

    To realize the demands of the masses at the time and place, there can be two ways: one is to reach out to the state, and the other is to rely on the masses to do it themselves. We firmly believe that the creativity of the people is infinite, and we firmly lead the masses to do it themselves.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang,' which means that the masses have great creativity. Among the Chinese people, there are indeed tens of thousands of 'Zhuge Liangs.' Every village and every town has its own 'Zhuge Liangs'." Dazhai built the stony and thin land into stable and high-yield farmland, relying on the "Zhuge Liangs" of Dazhai; Yu Jiang County overcame the two plagues of poverty and disease, relying on the "Zhuge Liangs" of Yu Jiang. For the people must rely on the people. Dazhai did it completely right, and Yu Jiang did it completely right as well.

    "Wholeheartedly for the people, relying on the people for everything" is the basic experience of our Party in achieving all victories. In socialist revolution and socialist construction, we must and can adopt the policy of self-reliance, precisely starting from this basic experience.

### 为人民

    为人民
    “为人民”，这是毛泽东思想的光辉结晶。毛泽东同志总是教导我们，全心全意为人民服务，人民利益高于一切。这是党的一切工作的出发点。哪一个时期，哪一个地区，我们执行毛泽东同志这个指示更完全、更自觉，我们的工作就大进步、大发展；反之，我们的工作就可能发生这样那样的问题。
    今天本报刊登的《一心为人民，一切靠人民》这篇通讯，说明余江县委“为人民”的思想是自觉的，行动是坚决的。他们一手抓阶级斗争，一手抓生产、治病两件大事，领导全县人民群众，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，坚持十五年，终于送走了疾病和贫穷两个瘟神。过去的疫区，今天是稳产高产的中心；过去的血吸虫病人，今天是劳动能手。一个贫病交困的低产县，变成了一个大寨式的先进县。
    为人民，是具体的，不是抽象的。
    毛泽东同志说过，“凡属正确的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的；凡属错误的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求不相适合，都是脱离群众的。”这是我们正确解决“为人民”这个问题的前提。
    我们常说，要根据群众的需要和自愿办事。需要，是当时当地人民的需要；自愿，是当时当地人民的自愿。离开“当时当地”的条件，需要和自愿就没有落脚点。为了做到这一步，各级党组织就必须深入了解当地群众的要求，因地因时制宜地贯彻执行党和国家的路线、方针、政策，发动群众实现党所提出的任务。余江县人民世世代代为血吸虫病所困扰，有些村庄早已十室九空；世世代代为干旱所威胁，生活非常贫困。在余江县，为人民服务，就必须领导余江人民，集中力量消灭血吸虫病，集中力量改变干旱、低产面貌。余江县委自觉地这样做了，反映了余江人民的切身利益，果然取得了全县人民的热诚拥护。
    马克思主义者担负着两种责任：一种是当时当地的实际任务，一种是将来的远大理想。只有尽可能彻底地完成了当时当地的实际任务，才能有根据有基础地发展到将来的远大理想那个阶段去。我们只要能够根据当时当地群众的利益，全心全意地为人民服务，那么，就能够不断提高人民群众的觉悟，使他们从这些事情出发，了解党提出来的更高的任务，真心实意地拥护党，拥护政府，把群众充分发动起来，真正自愿自觉地为实现长远的革命理想贡献自己的一切力量。
    我们是马克思列宁主义者，从来认为群众要依靠自己解放自己，反对任何包办恩赐的观点和做法。革命和建设都要依靠群众，自力更生，大家动手。我们强调要突出政治，要加强思想教育工作，正是为了提高群众的觉悟，使群众认识自己的利益，自愿自觉地在我们党的领导下，为自己的利益而奋斗。
    要实现当时当地群众的要求，可以有两个办法，一个是向国家伸手，一个是依靠群众自己动手。我们坚决相信人民群众的创造力是无穷的，坚决领导群众自己动手。
    毛泽东同志说过：“‘三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮’，这就是说，群众有伟大的创造力。中国人民中间，实在有成千成万的‘诸葛亮’，每个乡村，每个市镇，都有那里的‘诸葛亮’”。大寨把石厚土薄的山地建成稳产高产田，是靠了大寨的“诸葛亮”；余江县战胜了贫穷、疾病两个瘟神，是靠了余江的“诸葛亮”。为人民就必须依靠人民。大寨做得完全对，余江也做得完全对。
      “一心为人民，一切靠人民”，这是我们党取得一切胜利的基本经验。我们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，必须而且可能采取自力更生的方针，正是从这个基本经验出发的。
