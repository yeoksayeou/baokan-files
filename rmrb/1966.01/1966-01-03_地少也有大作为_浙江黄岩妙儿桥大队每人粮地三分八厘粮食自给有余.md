    Small Land Area, Big Achievement
    —Miaoerqiao Brigade, Huangyan, Zhejiang, More Than Self-Sufficient in Grain with Only 0.38 Mu of Grain Land Per Person
    An average of just over 0.3 mu of grain land per person can be considered very little. Yet, the people of Miaoerqiao have achieved grain self-sufficiency and more on such a small amount of land. Why did they, after so many years of relying on state-supplied grain, undergo such a great change? The main reason is that they established revolutionary thinking, learned from the advanced deeds of the neighboring Huijiang Brigade, found a model for surpassing, and made efforts to strive for self-improvement. When people's mental outlook changed, the face of production changed accordingly. The facts of Miaoerqiao tell people: setting up an opposite for oneself, actively creating conditions for transforming towards the opposite, the backward can become advanced, and the advanced will become even more advanced.
    On the coast of the East Sea, on the banks of the Cheng River, there is a small delta. Deep in the tangerine groves, next to the rice paddies, live more than one hundred and forty households, who have grown tangerines and rice for generations. This is the Miaoerqiao Brigade of Gongdong Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, a place with little land and many people but with grain self-sufficiency and more.
    When we visited this brigade, it was the season of ripe rice and yellow tangerines. Men and women commune members were busy sending basket after basket of rice into the collective warehouse and transporting load after load of tangerines to the state purchasing station. Last year, the good news of a double harvest of grain and tangerines spread here again.
    Miaorqiao is a place with little land and a large population. The year before last, the entire brigade had an average of only 0.38 mu of grain land and 0.19 mu of tangerine orchard per person. However, the commune members here, on such a small amount of land, resolutely listened to Chairman Mao's words and continuously created new records of stable and high yields with their own hands. Last year, they had already exceeded one thousand catties of grain per mu for six consecutive years, and the yield was higher year by year. Last year, the grain yield per unit area was more than double that of 1957 before communization and more than triple that of before liberation.
    Due to the exponential growth of grain production, the grain consumption level of the Miaoerqiao Brigade's commune members has continuously improved. In addition to distributing sufficient rations and feed to each commune member, the brigade has collectively stored more than 40,000 catties of grain in recent years, averaging more than 300 catties per household. From 1960 to the present, the Miaoerqiao Brigade has sold more than 2 million catties of tangerines to the state, as well as a large number of fat pigs and eggs.
    With just over 0.3 mu of grain land per person, the problem of food has been solved, and living standards have improved step by step, making a certain contribution to the country. Some people praise and say: Miaoerqiao, the magic lies in this.
    Not Being a Reaching-Out Hand
    Mao Baofu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Miaoerqiao Brigade, is a man just over thirty years old who has been the branch secretary for six years. We asked him, "How did your brigade, with its small land area and large population, solve the problem of food?" He replied frankly: "To solve the problem of food, we must first solve the problem of people's thinking."
    He then talked about the ideological revolution of their brigade.
    Miaorqiao is a famous Huangyan tangerine-producing area. In the past, there was very little grain land, and commune members sold a large number of tangerines to the state every year, and the state also supplied them with a portion of grain every year. Therefore, many commune members believed that eating state-supplied grain year after year was free from drought and flood, extremely safe, and an "iron rice bowl." Some people even said: "It is only right and proper for us tangerine-growing farmers to eat state grain; we say it loudly, and we feel it in our hearts." In this way, people sold tangerines to the state and bought grain from the state year after year, becoming accustomed to it.
    In the spring of 1959, with the further implementation of the Party's General Line for socialist construction throughout the country, countless waves were stirred up in the thinking of the Miaoerqiao commune members, just like the rising tide of the Cheng River. Mao Baofu, the son of a poor peasant who had joined the Party not long ago, was then the captain and Party小组长 of the Miaoerqiao Brigade. His thinking became increasingly unsettled as he listened to reports in the county, attended meetings in the commune, and researched work in the branch. After discussing with Chen Yunfu and several other Party members, he decided to mobilize the commune members to seriously study the General Line. At large meetings and small meetings, Mao Baofu said time and time again: "Chairman Mao put forward the General Line, asking us to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. Our team's grain yield is low, and we have to eat tens of thousands of catties of supplied grain every year, which does not conform to the spirit of the General Line. Our study of the General Line is to produce more grain, support the People's Liberation Army in defending our victorious achievements, and support the workers in building the country..."
    The commune members repeatedly discussed this issue, their understanding gradually increased, and they resolved to summon up their energy, strive for the upper reaches, and increase grain production. He Pingyun, a lower-middle peasant commune member, said: "We have little land and many people, so we have more labor, which creates conditions for high yields. Why was the yield low in the past? It was because we did not have the thought of striving for the upper reaches and the drive to strive for high yields." Some commune members proposed: "We can no longer ride on the back of an ox and watch cars run." Many commune members consciously examined the thinking of feeling "at ease" with eating supplied grain and resolved to make striving for grain self-sufficiency and more as their goal of effort.
    The determination to strive for grain self-sufficiency was there, but could it be realized quickly? Many people still lacked confidence.
    At this time, the Huangyan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience of the Huijiang Brigade of Xiaoyou Commune, which averaged 0.37 mu of grain land per person and exceeded one thousand catties of grain yield per mu, calling on commune members in the tangerine-growing areas to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Huijiang Brigade. Miaoerqiao and Huijiang are separated by only one Cheng River, and the advanced deeds of the Huijiang Brigade set a living example for the Miaoerqiao commune members. At this time, the brigade established a Party branch, and Mao Baofu was elected as the branch secretary. He immediately organized cadres and commune members to go to Huijiang to "learn the scriptures." After visiting Huijiang, old poor peasant commune member Xiang Daochan said excitedly: "Miaoerqiao and Huijiang have a hundred similarities, but the thinking is different. They have revolutionary drive, and we lack the spirit of striving for the upper reaches in our hearts." The advanced deeds of the Huijiang Brigade strengthened the confidence and broadened the horizons of the Miaoerqiao commune members. Therefore, the brigade Party branch gathered the opinions of the commune members and formulated a plan to seize high yields.
    Demanding More Grain from the Land
    Once the thinking is revolutionized, the drive comes out. Demanding more grain from the land, making one mu of land worth two mu, has become the unified action of all commune members. Poor and lower-middle peasant commune members stand at the forefront of the struggle to seize high yields.
    Miaorqiao is not far from the sea, the cultivated land has saline soil, a thin soil layer, small fields, and curved field ridges, and most of it relies on rainfall. Before liberation, two sentences were circulating here: Miaorqiao, Miaorqiao, the farmland is hard like stone strips, the rice seedlings wither without rain for three days, and planting rice is like planting leg hair.
    After liberation, after years of building water conservancy projects, the irrigation conditions in Miaoerqiao have been initially improved, but by 1959, the drought resistance capacity was only more than 20 days. In this way, how can the land guarantee high yields? At that time, the brigade Party branch decided to mobilize the masses to first make great efforts in the "water" aspect and carry out large-scale water conservancy projects.
    In the cold winter month, snowflakes were flying, and the weather was cold and the ground was frozen. The poor and lower-middle peasant commune members of Miaorqiao took the lead in working on water conservancy projects. People summoned up their energy and were not afraid of the cold, and one water conservancy project after another was completed ahead of schedule. The large canals were opened, the reservoirs were built, and the dikes and sluice gates were completed. The commune members then carried out land leveling and soil improvement activities. Hundreds of dan of river mud were added to each mu of land.
    The continuous revolution of people's thinking has brought about the continuous improvement of production conditions, and the result is the continuous increase in yield.
    Some people from other places who visited Miaoerqiao were deeply moved and said: The high yields here are the result of the commune members' hard work with their own hands and are the result of resolutely following the road pointed out by Chairman Mao.
    While actively carrying out farmland capital construction and improving production conditions, the cadres and commune members of the Miaoerqiao Brigade, in view of the characteristics of little land and many people, used their brains, thought of ways, tried to increase the yield per unit area as much as possible, tried to increase the land utilization rate as much as possible, and tried to save land as much as possible.
    Now, on the land of Miaorqiao, it is truly never idle in any season, and every crop produces high yields. The commune members plant three crops of grain a year in the fields, intercrop green manure crops, mung beans, and vegetables in the tangerine orchards, and plant miscellaneous grains, melons, and vegetables in the field edges, corners, and riversides, making use of every inch of space.
    When the commune members had the idea of relying on state-supplied grain, many people felt that the small amount of land was a "fixed scale" and could not achieve anything, but now they not only cherish every cent of arable land but also do not hesitate to put in effort and sweat, carrying dan after dan of soil from afar, filling in abandoned ditches and small ponds, and leveling soil piles, gradually increasing the area of cultivated land. In recent years, the area of cultivated land in the whole team has expanded by more than ten mu.
    However, achieving these things also went through a struggle between new and old ideas. Before liberation, the farmers here were accustomed to planting intercropped rice; some people also planted wheat in the rice fields, but they all failed. After visiting the Huijiang Brigade in 1959, the commune members' thinking became active, and old poor peasant Zhu Bingchun first proposed the suggestion: plant one more season of wheat, change two crops to three crops, and change intercropped rice to continuous cropping rice.
    The brigade Party branch attached importance to Zhu Bingchun's suggestion and decided to actively experiment with and promote the new three-crop system of two seasons of rice plus one season of wheat. Branch Secretary Mao Baofu first planted 1.9 mu of new three-crop experimental field with lower-middle peasant commune members Chen Tianya, Guan Xianjiang, and others, and the result was high yields for all three crops. The following year, the area of new three crops expanded to about eighty mu, with an average yield of 1,202 catties per mu. By 1964, the area of new three crops in the entire brigade accounted for more than 95% of the total area of rice fields.
    Vigorously Developing Diversified Economy
    Little land, great potential; much labor, even greater potential. The cadres of the Miaoerqiao Brigade used to often worry about the small amount of land, the large population, and the lack of outlets for the surplus labor; after the promotion of the three-crop system, there was still a surplus of labor, so what to do? Once, the commune held a meeting of brigade cadres, and the Party Committee secretary conveyed the instructions from higher levels on developing a diversified economy, proposing to organize the surplus labor, march towards all places and departments where they can exert their strength, and march towards the depth and breadth of production.
    The spirit of these instructions enlightened Mao Baofu. After he returned, he convened a branch meeting to study the issue of developing a diversified economy. Therefore, the brigade rationally arranged labor, fully utilized the specialties of each commune member, and in addition to increasing the amount of labor invested in grain fields and tangerine orchards by one-fold compared to 1957, it specially allocated dozens of laborers to engage in collective side-line production such as collective pig raising, grain processing, feed crushing, kiln burning, water surface aquaculture, and short-distance transportation, so that the income increased year by year. Last year, the collective side-line income had increased to more than 20,000 yuan, averaging nearly 200 yuan per commune member household, more than double that of three years ago, accounting for about one-quarter of the total income from agriculture and side-line occupations.
    This matter made Branch Secretary Mao Baofu realize: If there are many people who only eat, it is a bad thing, but if you listen to Chairman Mao's words and give play to everyone's role, many people become a good thing.
    Always Moving Forward
    The Miaoerqiao Brigade has maintained stable and high yields for six consecutive years, but the increase in production each year varies greatly. Although there are many reasons, Mao Baofu believes: The most important thing is the problem of people's thinking.
    The grain yield per mu in this brigade in 1962 only increased by three catties compared to the previous year, while in 1964 it increased by more than 200 catties compared to the previous year. Why is this? Originally, in 1961, the grain yield per mu in the Miaoerqiao Brigade increased by 130 catties compared to the previous year, exceeding the Huijiang Brigade for the first time. Therefore, cadres and commune members developed the idea of reaching the top of production and becoming complacent and slack, planting less spring grain and applying less fertilizer, which affected the production in 1962 and prevented a significant increase. In the winter of that year, the brigade Party branch mobilized cadres and commune members to examine the thinking of reaching the top of production and added new measures. By 1963, the grain yield per mu had increased to 1,398 catties, increasing by nearly 200 catties per mu. At this time, some cadres and commune members once again fostered complacency, saying: Production has hit the ceiling. In the winter of that year, Branch Secretary Mao Baofu participated in the provincial agricultural visiting group and visited the Yinxi Brigade of Yinxi Commune in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, and the Liming Brigade of Lianhua Commune in Longhai County. After Mao Baofu returned, he introduced in detail what he saw and heard, enabling everyone to overcome the idea of reaching the top of production. Therefore, in 1964, the grain yield per mu increased by another 222 catties. Now, the cadres and commune members of the Miaoerqiao Brigade have this experience: If people's thinking is fixed, the yield is also fixed; if people's thinking advances, the yield also advances.

### 地少也有大作为——浙江黄岩妙儿桥大队每人粮地三分八厘粮食自给有余

    地少也有大作为
    ——浙江黄岩妙儿桥大队每人粮地三分八厘粮食自给有余
    每人平均三分多粮田，可以说是很少了。妙儿桥人却在这样少的粮田上作到粮食自给有余。为什么他们多少年都吃国家供应的粮食，后来发生了这样一个大变化呢？主要原因是他们树立了革命的思想，学习了邻近的汇江大队的先进事迹，找到了超赶的榜样，作了奋发图强的努力。人的精神面貌变了，生产面貌随着变了。妙儿桥的事实告诉人们：自己为自己树立对立面，积极为向对立面转化创造条件，后进就能成为先进，先进就会更先进。
    东海之滨，澄江岸上，有一块小小的三角洲。桔林深处，稻田旁边，居住着一百四十多户人家，世代种桔，也种水稻。这就是地少人多而粮食自给有余的浙江省黄岩县拱东公社妙儿桥大队。
    我们到这个大队访问时，正是稻熟桔黄的季节，男女社员忙着把一箩箩稻谷送进集体仓库，一担担蜜桔运往国家收购站。去年这里又传出了粮桔双丰收的喜讯。
    妙儿桥是个地少人多的地方。前年，全大队平均每人只有粮田三分八厘，桔园一分九厘。可是这里的社员就在这样少的土地上，坚决听毛主席的话，用自己的双手不断创造出稳产高产新纪录。去年，已经连续六年粮食亩产超过了千斤，而且产量一年比一年高。去年粮食单位面积产量比公社化前的一九五七年增加一倍多，比解放前增加了三倍多。
    由于粮食产量的成倍增长，妙儿桥大队社员的用粮水平不断提高。大队除给每个社员分足口粮和饲料外，几年来集体储备粮食四万多斤，平均每户社员有三百多斤。从一九六○年到现在，妙儿桥大队向国家出售二百多万斤蜜桔，还有大量的肥猪和蛋品。
    每人三分多粮田就解决了吃饭问题，而且生活步步提高，对国家作出了一定的贡献。有人赞扬说：妙儿桥，妙就妙在这里。
    不当伸手派
    妙儿桥大队党支部书记毛宝富，是个三十刚出头的人，当支部书记已经六年了。我们问他：“你们大队地少人多是怎样解决了吃饭问题的？”他爽朗地回答：要解决吃饭问题，先要解决人的思想问题。”
    他接着谈了他们大队思想革命的经过。
    妙儿桥是著名的黄岩蜜桔产区，过去粮田就很少，社员们年年出售大量蜜桔给国家，国家也年年供应他们一部分粮食。因此，很多社员认为吃国家的粮食年年无荒旱，顶保险，是“铁饭碗”。有的人还说：“我们桔区农民吃国家粮食是理所当然，嘴里讲得响，心里忖得平。”就这样，人们年年卖了桔子，向国家买粮食，年复一年，已经习以为常了。
    一九五九年春天，随着党的建设社会主义总路线在全国各地进一步贯彻执行，妙儿桥社员们的思想中，也象澄江涨潮一样，激起了无数浪花。入党不久的贫农儿子毛宝富，当时是妙儿桥大队的队长和党小组长。他在县里听报告，在公社开会，在支部研究工作，思想越来越不平静了。他和陈云富等几个党员商量后，决定发动社员认真学习总路线。在大会上、小会上，毛宝富一次又一次地说：“毛主席提出总路线，要我们多快好省地建设社会主义。我们队粮食产量低，每年要吃几万斤供应粮，这不符合总路线精神。我们学习总路线，就是要多生产粮食，支援解放军保卫我们的胜利果实，支援工人建设国家……”
    社员们反复地讨论这个问题，认识逐渐提高了，决心鼓足干劲，力争上游，把粮食产量搞上去。下中农社员何平云说：“我们田少人多，劳动力就多，高产有条件。过去产量为什么低？就是没有争上游的思想，没有争高产的干劲。”有的社员提出：“我们再不能骑在牛背上看汽车跑了。”许多社员自觉地检查了吃供应粮“心安理得”的思想，决心把争取粮食自给有余作为努力的目标。
    争取粮食自给的决心有了，但是能不能很快地实现呢？很多人还信心不足。
    这时，中共黄岩县委总结了孝友公社汇江大队平均每人三分七厘粮田，粮食亩产量超过千斤的经验，号召桔区社员学习汇江大队的革命精神。妙儿桥和汇江只隔一条澄江，汇江大队的先进事迹给妙儿桥社员树立了一个活的榜样。这时，大队成立了党支部，毛宝富被选为支部书记。他立即组织干部、社员去汇江“取经”。老贫农社员项道灿从汇江参观回来后激动地说：“妙儿桥和汇江有一百个相象，就是思想不一样。他们有革命干劲，我们心眼里缺个力争上游。”汇江大队的先进事迹使妙儿桥社员增强了信心，开阔了眼界。于是，大队党支部集中了社员的意见，制订了夺取高产的计划。
    向土地多要粮
    思想一革命，干劲就出来了。向土地多要粮，使一亩地当两亩用，成为全体社员的统一行动。贫农下中农社员站在夺取高产斗争的最前面。
    妙儿桥离海不远，耕地土质咸，土层薄，田块小，田塍弯，大部分是靠天田。解放前这里流传着两句话：妙儿桥，妙儿桥，田土磞硬象石条，三天没雨稻苗枯，种起水稻象脚毛。
    解放后经过连年兴修水利，妙儿桥的灌溉条件初步得到改善，但是到一九五九年，抗旱能力只有二十多天。这样，土地怎么能保证高产呢？当时大队党支部决定发动群众，先从“水”字上大下功夫，大规模兴修水利工程。
    这年寒冬腊月，雪花纷飞，天冷地冻。妙儿桥的贫农下中农社员带头出工修水利。人们鼓足干劲不畏寒冷，一处又一处的水利工程提前完成。大渠开好了，水库建成了，堤闸完工了。社员们接着又开展了平整土地、改良土壤活动。每亩田增加了成百担河泥。
    人们的思想不断革命，带来了生产条件的不断改善，结果是产量的不断提高。
    有些外地的人到妙儿桥参观访问后，深深感动地说：这里的高产是社员们用双手辛辛苦苦干出来的，是坚决跟着毛主席指的道路走出来的。
    妙儿桥大队的干部和社员在积极进行农田基本建设、改善生产条件的同时，针对地少人多的特点，动脑筋，想办法，尽量提高单位面积产量，尽量提高土地利用率，尽量节约土地。
    现在妙儿桥的土地上，真是四季不空，熟熟高产。社员们在田里一年种植三熟粮食，在桔园里套种了绿肥作物、绿豆和蔬菜，在田头、地角、河边见缝插针，种杂粮瓜菜。
    当社员们存在着依赖国家供应粮食的思想的时候，很多人觉得土地少是“钉死的秤”，干不出名堂，可是现在他们不但珍惜一分一厘耕地，而且不惜出力流汗，从远处挑来一担又一担的泥土，把废沟小塘填平，把土堆削平，一点一滴地增加耕地，几年来全队耕地面积扩大了十多亩。
    但是，做到这些也是经历过一番新旧思想的斗争的。解放前，这里的农民习惯种间作稻；有些人也在稻田里种过小麦，但都失败了。一九五九年参观汇江大队以后，社员们思想活跃了，老贫农朱炳春首先提出建议：多种一季麦，把两熟改为三熟，把间作稻改为连作稻。
    大队党支部重视朱炳春的建议，决定积极试验推广两季稻加一季麦的新三熟制。支部书记毛宝富首先和下中农社员陈田芽、管仙江等人种了一亩九分新三熟试验田，结果三熟高产。第二年，新三熟面积扩大到八十亩左右，平均亩产达到一千二百零二斤。到一九六四年，全大队新三熟面积就占稻田总面积的百分之九十五以上。
    大兴多种经营
    土地少，潜力大；劳力多，潜力更大。妙儿桥大队的干部过去经常为地少人多、多余的劳动力没有出路而发愁；推广三熟制以后，劳力还过剩，怎么办呢？有一次，公社召开了大队干部会议，党委书记在会上传达上级关于开展多种经营的指示，提出把多余的劳动力组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军。
    这些指示的精神，使毛宝富的思想开了窍。他回来后就召开支部会，研究开展多种经营的问题。于是大队合理安排劳力，充分发挥每个社员的特长，除了粮田和桔园比一九五七年增加一倍投工量以外，专门抽出几十个劳动力，从事集体养猪、粮食加工、饲料粉碎、造窑烧灰、水面养殖和短途运输等集体副业生产，使收益逐年增加。去年，集体副业收入已增加到两万多元，平均每户社员近二百元，比三年前增加两倍多，占农副业总收入四分之一左右。
    这件事使支部书记毛宝富体会到：人多要是光吃饭，就是坏事，但是听毛主席的话，发挥每个人的作用，人多就变成了好事。
    永远要前进
    妙儿桥大队连续六年稳产高产，但是每年增产幅度却有大有小。原因尽管很多，毛宝富认为：最主要的是人的思想问题。
    这个大队一九六二年粮食亩产只比上一年增加三斤，而一九六四年却比上一年增产二百多斤，这是为什么？原来，一九六一年，妙儿桥大队粮食亩产比上一年增加一百三十斤，第一次超过了汇江大队。于是，干部和社员就产生了增产到顶、自满松懈思想，春粮少种了，肥料少施了，结果影响了一九六二年产量不能大幅度提高。这年冬天，大队党支部发动干部和社员检查了增产到顶的思想，增加了新的措施，到一九六三年粮食亩产提高到一千三百九十八斤，每亩增产近二百斤。这时，有些干部和社员又滋长了自满思想，他们说：产量已碰到天花板。这年冬天，支部书记毛宝富参加省农业参观团到福建省福清县音西公社音西大队和龙海县莲花公社黎明大队参观。毛宝富回来后，详细介绍了所见所闻，使大家克服了增产到顶思想。于是，一九六四年粮食亩产又增加二百二十二斤。现在，妙儿桥大队的干部和社员都有这样的体会：人的思想定牢了，产量也定牢；人的思想前进了，产量也前进。
