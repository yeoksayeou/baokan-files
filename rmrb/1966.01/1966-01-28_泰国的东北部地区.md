    The Kingdom of Thailand is divided into four major regions: Northeast, North, Central, and South, comprising a total of seventy-one provinces. The Northeast includes fifteen provinces, namely: Udon Thani, Ubon Ratchathani, Nong Khai, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Phanom, Sakon Nakhon, Loei, Surin, Roi Et, Kalasin, Buriram, Sisaket, Chaiyaphum, Maha Sarakham. It covers an area of approximately 170,000 square kilometers, with a population of nearly nine million, both accounting for one-third of the country. The ethnic groups residing in this area are mainly Thai, Lao, and Miao.

    The northeastern region is located in the tropics with a dry climate. Agriculture is mainly focused on growing corn, and it is rich in cotton and tobacco. Under the cruel rule of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, the people of the Northeast live in misery. A large number of farmers have been driven from their homes, and their land has been forcibly seized. In 1964 alone, 3,000 farming households were forced to leave their villages, and 110,000 rai (each rai equals 2.4 mu) of land was robbed.

    The northeastern region of Thailand is separated from the central and lower Laos regions by the Mekong River, and borders Cambodia to the south, making its strategic position very important. In recent years, in order to expand its war of aggression in Indochina, U.S. imperialism has built and expanded a network of military bases and crisscrossing strategic highways here. A huge U.S. Air Force base and a secret missile base have been established in Khorat, the gateway to the Northeast region. U.S. military bases and military airports have also been built in Udon Thani and Ubon Ratchathani.

    泰国的东北部地区
    泰国分为东北部、北部、中部和南部四大地区，全国共七十一个府。东北部包括十五个府，即：乌隆、乌汶、廊开、孔敬、呵叻、那空拍侬、沙空那空、黎府、素辇、黎逸、加拉信、武里南、四杀吉、猜也蓬、马哈沙拉堪。面积约十七万平方公里，人口将近九百万，两者均占全国三分之一。居住在这个地区的民族，主要是泰族、老族和苗族。
    东北部地区地处热带，气候干燥，农业以种植玉米为主，盛产棉花和烟草等。在美帝国主义和泰国反动派的残酷统治下，东北部人民生活在水深火热之中。大批农民被逐出家园，土地被强占，仅一九六四年就有三千农户被迫远离乡井，十一万莱（每莱合二点四市亩）土地被抢走。
    泰国东北部地区与老挝的中、下寮地区仅隔一条湄公河，南边紧邻柬埔寨，战略地位非常重要。近几年来，美帝国主义为在印度支那扩大侵略战争，在这里修建和扩建了星罗棋布的军事基地和纵横交错的战略公路。在通往东北部地区的门户——呵叻，建立了巨大的美国空军基地和秘密导弹基地。在乌隆和乌汶等地，也建有美军基地和军用机场。
