    Faced with New Things

    Can improved early rice varieties be used in late-season rice paddies? We experimented for several years, and all failed.

    People were discouraged and wanted to quit. But the county committee comrades encouraged us: "Go for it! Failure won't be criticized, and success will be greatly praised!" The support of the county committee gave us confidence and strength. Last year, the use of improved early rice varieties in late-season rice paddies was finally successful: in 634 mu of late-season rice paddies, the average yield was 982 jin per mu, an increase of more than 330 jin compared to the previous year's late-season yield.

    New things always grow and strengthen in struggle. New sprouting things need support. Timely support, especially from leaders, will give people the courage to fight. The Chao'an case is clear evidence.

    County leaders should constantly ask themselves: when faced with new things, are they ridiculing and coldly mocking, standing by and watching, or enthusiastically supporting and caring for them?　　Editor

    在新生事物面前
    早稻良种能不能用在晚造稻田？我们试验了几年，都失败了。
    人们泄气了，要洗手不干了。县委同志却鼓励我们：“闯吧！失败不受批评，成功大力表扬！”县委的支持，给了我们信心和力量。去年晚造田用早稻良种终于成功：在六百三十四亩晚稻田里，每亩平均产九百八十二斤，比前年晚造单产增加三百三十多斤。

    新事物从来是在斗争中成长壮大的。新萌芽的事物需要扶持。及时的扶持，特别是来自领导的扶持，会给人们增添斗争的勇气。潮安的事实是个明证。
    县的领导同志，随时要自问：在新事物面前，自己是热嘲冷讽、袖手旁观，还是热情支持、关怀备至呢？　　编者
