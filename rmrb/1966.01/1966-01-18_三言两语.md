    A Few Words
    Nonsense and Delirium
    American Secretary of State Rusk said in Saigon: "The United States is determined to do whatever it can to ensure the security, freedom, and prosperity of South Vietnam."
    It is obvious that the United States will do its utmost to "preserve South Vietnam," and Rusk's repeated assurances are clearly superfluous nonsense. However, due to the aggression of U.S. imperialism, South Vietnam's "security, freedom, and prosperity" have long been swept away. This is also obvious. But Rusk still talks about guaranteeing the "security, freedom, and prosperity of South Vietnam," which no longer exists at all. Isn't this just daydreaming?
    Changed and Unchanged
    The United States withdrew a battalion of troops from West Berlin. A U.S. military authority spokesman specifically stated that it had "nothing to do with Vietnam." This is a complete case of "putting up a sign saying 'No 300 taels of silver buried here.'"
    At the same time, he also stated that this "does not indicate any change in U.S. policy in Berlin..." This is the truth. The United States withdrew troops from Berlin, indeed not because its policy of occupying West Berlin had changed, but because the "confrontational situation" there had changed due to changes in other people's policies.
    Cowards Pretending to Be Heroes
    The American invading forces, who launched a large-scale invasion of the "Iron Triangle" area northwest of Saigon, fled in panic under the fierce attacks of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces.
    A few days ago, the American invaders barged into the "Iron Triangle" with great arrogance, intending to carry out a so-called "sweeping action." When the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces adopted the strategy of "the enemy advances, we retreat," they complained that they could not find the "Viet Cong." Before long, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces switched to the strategy of "the enemy tires, we strike," and for the American invading forces, the "Viet Cong" appeared without being sought. As a result, these young masters carrying out the "sweeping action" "swept up" their own luggage and backpacks and fled. These heroes turned out to be utter cowards.

专栏：三言两语

    三言两语
    废话和梦话
    美国国务卿腊斯克在西贡说：“美国决心做它力所能及的任何事情来保证南越的安全、自由和繁荣。”
    美国要竭尽其力来“保住南越”，这是明摆的，腊斯克的再三保证显然是多余的废话。但是，由于美帝国主义的侵略，南越的“安全、自由和繁荣”早就荡然无存了。这也是明摆的。而腊斯克还大谈什么要保证已经根本不存在的“南越的安全、自由和繁荣”，这不是白日说梦话又是什么？
    变和未变
    美国从西柏林撤出一营驻军。美军当局发言人特意声明“同越南毫无关系”。这完全是“此地无银三百两”。
    同时，他还声明，这“并不表明美国在柏林的政策有任何改变……”，这倒是实话。美国从柏林撤出军队，的确并不是因为它的霸占西柏林的政策改变了，而是因为在那里的“对峙形势”由于别人的政策改变而改变了。
    孱头假充好汉
    对西贡西北“铁三角”地带大举进犯的美国侵略军，在南越人民武装的猛烈攻击之下，仓惶逃窜。
    前几天，美国侵略者闯进了“铁三角”，气焰万丈，要实行所谓“席卷行动”。当南越人民武装采取“敌进我退”的战略时，他们就埋怨找不到“越共”。曾几何时，南越人民武装转而采取“敌疲我打”的战略，对美国侵略军来说，是“越共”不找而到了。结果，这些执行“席卷行动”任务的少爷兵却“席卷”自己的行李背包，逃之夭夭。这些英雄好汉原来是十足的孱头。
