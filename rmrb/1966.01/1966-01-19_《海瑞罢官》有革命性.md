    《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 has Revolutionary Significance
     Ke Zhaoli
    《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 has its practical significance. Comrade Wu Han basically achieved using the past to serve the present. At that time, right-leaning opportunists rampantly launched attacks against the Party. In order to make people recognize the true face of right-leaning opportunists, Comrade Wu Han appropriately elevated Hai Rui, on the basic premise of conforming to historical facts. This was necessary and permissible.
    The practical significance of 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 also lies in its revelation of a very important historical lesson – reformism is a dead end. Look, Hai Rui shouted himself hoarse: "This humble servant is exhausting his mind and strength, precisely to establish a foundation for Jiangnan for thousands of years, to repay the Emperor's grace and the kindness of my patrons." He repeatedly called for "eliminating traitors and rectifying the court." However, in an era when the feudal system was on the verge of collapse, he still attempted to use internal reforms within the ruling class to replace the violent revolution of the peasants, to prolong the dog's life of the feudal ruling class, and to obstruct the progress of the wheel of history. It was truly "like an ant trying to shake a tree, how easy can it be?" Therefore, he inevitably met the fate of being dismissed and driven off the political stage. Now, modern revisionists are still babbling about "capitalism peacefully growing into socialism through political reforms," etc., while 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 clearly tells us that reformism is not viable. From this perspective, 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 still has a certain positive effect on our anti-revisionist struggle today.

    《海瑞罢官》有革命性
     柯兆利
    《海瑞罢官》是有其现实意义的，吴晗同志基本上做到了古为今用。那时，右倾机会主义者猖狂地向党发动进攻。吴晗同志为了使人们认清右倾机会主义者的本来面目，在基本符合历史事实的条件下，对海瑞适当拔高，这是必要的，也是许可的。
    《海瑞罢官》的现实意义还在于它揭示了一条很重要的历史教训——改良主义，此路不通。你看，海瑞声嘶力竭地喊着：“区区竭尽心力，正欲为江南立千百年基业，酬上恩报知己也。”他口口声声要“除奸贼整顿纲常”。可是，他在封建制度濒于崩溃的时代，还企图用统治阶级内部改良来代替农民的暴力革命，来苟延封建统治阶级的狗命，来阻挡历史车轮的前进，真是“蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”因此，他终于免不了被罢职、被赶出政治舞台的下场。现在，现代修正主义者还在胡说什么“资本主义通过政治改良，可以和平长入社会主义”等等，而《海瑞罢官》明明告诉我们改良主义是行不通的。这样看来，《海瑞罢官》对于我们今天的反修斗争，还是有一定的积极作用的。
