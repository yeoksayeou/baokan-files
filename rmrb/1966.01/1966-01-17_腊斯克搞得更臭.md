　　Imperialists and reactionaries have never been able to achieve a state of genuine and deceptive confusion when engaging in counter-revolutionary dual tactics. False peace can never ultimately conceal true war. No matter how cunning the US's "peace offensive" is, and no matter how many people echo it, there can be no exception.

　　Among the "peace" envoys dispatched by Johnson, Harriman was known as a "negotiation expert," but after making a few rounds, he revealed his fox tail, shouting loudly in Australia that US policy towards Vietnam had not changed in any way and that the US would not "retreat" from South Vietnam. Now, Rusk himself has stepped forward, making a deal with Kosygin in New Delhi, and then joined Harriman in Saigon. After several rounds, not only is the fox's tail revealed even more clearly, but the fox's stench is also emanating.

　　After Rusk and Harriman met with the South Vietnamese puppets, they publicly reiterated that they would "take all necessary military measures" and "fully support" the South Vietnamese puppets in opposing so-called "external aggression." Look, isn't this putting Harriman's words more definitively? According to US news agencies, the "joint communiqué" has made the South Vietnamese puppets even more arrogant, which is hardly accidental, is it?

　　What is even more significant is that Rusk's production of this "joint communiqué" inevitably embarrasses the partners and followers of Johnson's "peace talks" deception, because aren't these self-proclaimed "impartial" and "peace-loving" partners "impartially" standing on the side of the South Vietnamese puppets, just like Rusk, and "loving" the expansion of the war?

    腊斯克搞得更臭
    帝国主义和反动派在搞反革命两手的时候，从来没有能够做到以假乱真。假和平始终掩盖不了真战争。美国的“和平攻势”再狡猾，附和的人再多，也不能例外。
    约翰逊派出的满天飞的“和平”特使中，哈里曼被称为“谈判能手”，但他兜了几个圈子后，就露出了狐狸尾巴，在澳大利亚大叫美国侵越政策没有任何改变，美国将不从南越“后退”。现在，腊斯克亲自出马，在新德里同柯西金作了一笔交易，再到西贡同哈里曼会合在一起。几个回合之后，不仅狐狸尾巴露得更加显眼，而且狐狸臭气也冲出来了。
    腊斯克和哈里曼同南越傀儡会谈后，公开重申要“采取一切必要的军事措施”，
  “全力支持”南越傀儡反对所谓“外来侵略”。请看，这不是把哈里曼的话，说得更托底了吗？据美国通讯社报道，“联合公报”使得南越傀儡的气焰更加嚣张起来，这难道是偶然的吗？
    更有意义的是，腊斯克搞出这个“联合公报”来，未免使约翰逊“和谈”骗局的合伙者和追随者十分难堪，因为，这些自称“公正”、“热爱和平”的合伙者，岂不是同腊斯克一样，“公正”地站在南越傀儡一边，“热爱”扩大战争了吗？
