    In the past, when we did our work, we always focused on business for the sake of business. When we started working, we shouted about the "three major viewpoints" and "improving service quality," but in reality, business came first, and the plan was in charge. All year round, we were busy with the plan. It was really "a thousand miles of rivers flow into the sea, and all kinds of work depend on the plan." As long as the plan targets were completed, all the work was considered well done. At one point, we even created a plan progress chart called "Let's Compare": comparing every ten days, evaluating every month. As long as the plan could go up, it was considered advanced. This put a lot of pressure on the lower levels.

    The higher-ups only focused on the plan, not on politics, so the lower levels only revolved around the plan targets. In this situation, some units used all kinds of crooked methods. Some gave customers haircuts and pedicures, not according to the operating procedures, only seeking speed, not quality. Some hotels made a lot of "convenience" measures, which actually became money-making measures. For example, making long-distance calls for customers, etc., all required fees. In order to get employees to do more work, some industries implemented piecework bonuses and material incentives. Anyway, as long as the plan could be completed, any method was used, but they didn't understand how to focus on politics. In this way, on the surface, sometimes the plan was completed well, and the enterprise made money, but the service quality was reduced, and there was a political loss. Customers were not satisfied, and employees were holding their breath. In a word: focusing on business without politics, the more you focus, the more blurred the direction becomes.

    Since the launch of the socialist education movement last year, the company's Party committee has made great efforts to organize employees to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way; to grasp ideological revolutionization, to grasp the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing; to grasp the commendation of good people and good deeds; at the same time, it was determined to streamline 38 percent of the personnel in the company's organs, and also sent working groups to stay at the lower levels, conduct investigations and research, and improve leadership style. As a result, the revolutionary consciousness of the vast number of employees has been greatly improved. Shaving, pedicures, pouring tea, pouring water, washing clothes, and taking photos are all the ideas of doing revolution, which are becoming more and more intense in the enterprise. In the past, when everyone did their work, they had the word "I" in their hearts, and at most they had a plan. Now, what is in their hearts is revolution, serving the people, Bethune, Zhang Side, Lei Feng, Wang Jie...

    Ideological revolutionization has brought about "automation" in action, and everyone is competing to do their work. Numerous good people and good deeds have emerged in the enterprise who love customers, take the store as their home, and wholeheartedly serve the people. In addition to implementing the original convenience measures, all walks of life have also formulated some new methods to facilitate the masses. Everyone has launched a great upsurge in practicing basic skills, striving to improve technology and improve service quality. In order to achieve diligence and thrift in running enterprises, the employees have come up with all kinds of good ideas that the cadres could not have thought of, saving expenses bit by bit. At the end of last year, we initially selected 31 "five-good" units, 78 "six-good" employees, and 155 activists in various fields. It is true: emphasizing politics and grasping business, the more people work, the more energetic they become. With the word revolution in everyone's heart, all their energy is used in their work. When people are united, there are more methods, and can business not be done well? Since we launched the socialist education movement in March last year, we have exceeded all plan targets every quarter. Zhengzhou City Service Company Zhang Ruquan

    不问政治抓业务　越抓方向越模糊
    我们过去做工作，老是就业务抓业务。做起工作来，嘴里喊着“三大观点”、“提高服务质量”，实际上是业务第一，计划当家，一年到头围着计划忙。真是“水流千里归大海，万般工作看计划”，只要计划指标完成了，一切工作都算抓好了。有一个时期，我们还搞了一个计划进度表，叫做“比比看”：十天一比，一月一评，只要计划能上去就算先进。这一手对下边的压力可大了。
    上边只抓计划，不抓政治，下边也就只是围着计划指标转圈子。在这种情况下，有的单位就把各式各样的邪门歪道都使出来了。有的给顾客理发、修脚，不按操作规程办事，只求快，不求好。有的旅社订了不少“便民”措施，实际上成了赚钱措施。象代客挂长途电话等等，都要收费。为了叫职工多做活，有的行业搞了提成奖，实行物质刺激。反正只要能完成计划，啥法都使，就是不懂得抓政治。这样一来，表面上有时计划完成得不错，企业赚了钱，可是服务质量降低了，政治上亏了本。顾客不满意，职工憋着气。一句话：不问政治抓业务，越抓方向越模糊。
    去年开展社会主义教育运动以后，公司党委下大功夫组织职工活学活用毛主席著作；抓思想革命化，抓比学赶帮超运动，抓表扬好人好事；同时，下决心精简了公司机关百分之三十八的人员，还派出工作组到下边蹲点，开展调查研究，改进领导作风。这一来，广大职工的革命觉悟大大提高了。剃头、修脚、斟茶、倒水、洗衣、照相都是干革命的思想，在企业里越搞越浓了。过去大家干工作，心里装着个“我”字，说到头也不过装着个计划。现在心里装的是革命，是为人民服务，是白求恩、张思德、雷锋、王杰……。
    思想上的革命化带来了行动上的“自动化”，大家争着比着干工作。企业里出现了数不胜数的热爱顾客，以店为家，一心一意为人民的好人好事。各行各业除落实了原有的便民措施以外，还新订了一些方便群众的办法。大家掀起了大练基本功的热潮，努力提高技术，提高服务质量。为了做到勤俭办企业，职工同志们想出了干部们所想不出的种种好主意，一点一滴地节省费用开支。去年年底，我们就初步评选出了三十一个“五好”单位，七十八名“六好”职工和一百五十五名各方面的积极分子。真是：突出政治抓业务，人们越干劲越足。大家心里有了革命二字，浑身的劲就都用在工作上了，人心齐了，办法也多了，业务还有个抓不好的？从去年三月我们开展社会主义教育运动以来，季季都超额完成了全部计划。郑州市服务公司　张汝泉
