    Brief Comments
    Two companies of U.S. paratroopers launched a frantic attack on a small village with only three thatched huts in the Mekong Delta, firing thousands of shells. The result was a complete flop, with not even a shadow of a South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldier to be seen. However, many U.S. soldiers were killed and wounded by their own artillery fire. United Press International, in reporting this "battle," described the heroism of the U.S. troops during the attack, writing: "It was a fierce battle."
    What a "fierce battle"! This is indeed worth writing about. First, American weapons demonstrated their power—killing their own people. Second, the morale of the young American soldiers was high—when there were no enemies present.

    The American invading forces have recently been rampantly using poison gas on the South Vietnamese battlefield. U.S. military commanders actually said that this inhuman weapon was some kind of "humanitarian thing."
    What Hitler did not dare to use openly, American imperialism not only repeatedly uses in South Vietnam, but also openly calls this bloodless crime "humanitarianism." This shows that American imperialism is indeed the most ferocious, cruel, and arrogant aggressor in history.

    The New Year's editorial of *The New York Times* wrote uneasily about the prospects for the Vietnam invasion:
    "As 1966 begins, the United States is falling into an unknown abyss... the future is unpredictable."
    Having fallen into an irredeemable abyss, yet hoping for a glimmer of hope in something "unknown"; harboring wishful thinking, yet not daring to "predict" whether there is truly a glimmer of hope for salvation. This is precisely a self-portrait of the decline, bankruptcy, and despairing mentality of American imperialism today.

    三言两语
    美军伞兵两连，在湄公河三角洲向一个只有三所茅屋的小村庄发动了一次疯狂的进攻，发射了几千发炮弹，结果完全扑了空，连一个南越解放军的影子也没有看到，而不少美军却被自己的炮火打死打伤。合众国际社在报道这场“战斗”时，描写了美军在进攻时如何英勇，它写道：“这是一场激战”。
    好一场“激战”！这的确值得大书特书。第一、美国的武器发挥威力——打死了自己人，第二、美国少爷兵士气高昂——在没有敌人的时候。

    美国侵略军最近在南越战场上猖狂地使用毒气。美军指挥官居然说，这种灭绝人性的武器是什么“人道主义的东西”。
    希特勒不敢公开使用的，美帝国主义却不仅一再在南越使用，而且公然把这种杀人不见血的罪行称之为“人道主义”。这表明，美帝国主义确是历史上最凶恶、最残暴、最狂妄的侵略者。

    《纽约时报》的新年社论，对侵越前景不安地写道：
  “在一九六六年开始的时候，美国正堕入未知的深渊之中，……未来是无法预言的”。
    既堕入了万劫不复的深渊，又想寄一线希望于“未知”的东西；既存侥幸心理，又不敢“预言”是否真有一线得救之望。这正是今天美帝国主义没落、破产与绝望心理的自我写照。
