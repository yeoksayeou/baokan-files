    A Pair of Iron Shoulders Transform Heaven and Earth
    —An Account of the Struggle of the Daqiao Brigade in Ruichang, Jiangxi, to Improve Red Soil and Achieve High Cotton Yields

    The cadres and members of the Daqiao Brigade in the Daqiao Commune of Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, with the nation at heart, have worked hard for twelve years on the barren, drought-stricken red soil hills, achieving high cotton yields year after year on a large scale, while also becoming self-sufficient in grain and making significant contributions to the country.

    Most of Daqiao’s more than 700 mu of cotton fields are distributed on twenty-one fragmented red soil hills on the west bank of Chi Lake in northern Jiangxi. Before liberation, people described it as a poor place where "the land is on yellow earth tips, water depends on rainy days, there is no rice to eat, and no cotton to harvest for clothing."

    After liberation, the people of Daqiao organized themselves, relying on their own shoulders and hands to transform the barren red soil into fertile black soil, overcoming two moderate drought years with more than fifty days of no rain and three severe drought years with more than one hundred days of no rain, enabling the brigade's 700 mu of cotton fields to continuously produce more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu for four consecutive years. Last year, the yield of ginned cotton reached as high as 150 jin per mu, an increase of more than seven times compared to the year of liberation, and more than two times compared to before the cooperative movement. Last year, the brigade's more than 640 mu of wheat (of which more than 590 mu were intercropped with cotton) averaged more than 300 jin per mu, an increase of 82% compared to the previous year, and nearly two times compared to before the cooperative movement. In recent years, the brigade has sold an average of more than 90 jin of ginned cotton per person to the state each year; since 1961, the brigade's grain has been self-sufficient and more than enough.

          Poor Land, Strong Shoulders

    The winter of 1953 was the starting point for the people of Daqiao to organize and transform the barren red soil.

    At that time, thirty-three peasant households in Daqiao Village, under the leadership of Hu Huaxian, the first Communist Party member in Daqiao and the current secretary of the brigade's Party branch, organized the first elementary agricultural production cooperative. As soon as the agricultural cooperative was established, many members eagerly demanded to transform the barren red soil and change the low cotton yield situation. To transform the acidic red soil, which had poor water retention, it was necessary to apply large amounts of fertilizer, deepen the soil layer, loosen the soil structure, and increase organic matter. However, the surrounding area was full of bare mountains and ridges, lacking sources of fertilizer. Relying solely on farm manure was far from enough to meet the needs.

    What should be done? Some people said: Go to Chi Lake at the foot of the mountain to scoop up lake mud, harvest lake grass, and carry fertilizer up the mountain.

    However, with the land so scattered and the soil so barren, how many years would it take to make the soil thick and the land fertile?

    Through discussion, people's thoughts were unified. The people of Daqiao braved the severe winter and launched the prelude to carrying mud to improve the soil in the Wanjia Branch of the lake.

    In the lake, dozens of male and female cooperative members stood barefoot in the icy cold mud, wielding shovels to scoop the mud and grass ashore.

    On the shore, another group of cooperative members used baskets to carry the mud and grass, facing the cold wind, climbing slopes and mountains, and sending it to the red soil land. Many people carried sixteen or seventeen loads a day, each round trip taking more than three li. People's shoulders were rubbed red and swollen. But no one complained.

    From that winter to the autumn of 1954, the people of Daqiao first spread more than 350 loads of lake mud and more than 100 loads of lake grass per mu on the more than 40 mu of red soil hills near the lake. As a result, the cotton yield of these lands increased by 31% compared to the previous year.

    The initial victory greatly encouraged the people of Daqiao. By 1962, many of the red soil hills near the lake had changed from barren to fertile, from thin to thick, and from red to black, and the cotton yield had also significantly improved. However, there were still many lands farther away from the lake that were still relatively barren. Facing these situations, some people thought: Anyway, we have enough to eat and wear now, we can take a break for two years and still get by, why bother suffering like this? In response to this idea, the Party branch organized all the members to carry out a discussion on "For whom do we carry mud, for whom do we suffer?"

    Through recalling the bitter past and envisioning the future, the people of Daqiao broadened their horizons and improved their awareness. Carrying mud to improve the soil felt as if they were carrying not just mud, but loads of cotton and grain, carrying the heavy burden of supporting national construction.

    From the winter of 1953 to the present, the people of Daqiao have carried lake mud and lake grass for twelve years. The soil layer of the brigade's more than 700 mu of red soil land on twenty-one hills has changed from thin to thick, from barren to fertile, and from red to black. The preliminary improvement of the soil has caused cotton yields to rise year by year. The Daqiao people's desire to transform the barren red soil and change the low-yield situation has finally been realized today.

          Heaven is Dry, but the Land is Not

    With this "iron shoulders" spirit, the people of Daqiao, while transforming the red soil, also waged a tenacious struggle against drought.

    Water is the lifeblood of agriculture, and barren red soil needs even more water. However, although Daqiao is close to Chi Lake, the land is on the mountain, and the lake is at the foot of the mountain, the land is high and the water is low, visible but unattainable. Therefore, before liberation, a drought would occur after ten days or half a month of no rain, and a disaster would occur after more than fifty days of no rain.

    After liberation, especially after the cooperative movement, the people of Daqiao no longer resigned themselves to fate. They said: In the past, growing cotton was for our own survival; now, growing cotton is to support national construction. Regardless of whether it is dry or not, we must not only grow it well, but also ensure a good harvest. If there is no water, we will go to Chi Lake to carry it.

    For twelve years, they carried water in small droughts, carried water in large droughts, braving the scorching sun, enduring heat and thirst, using sweat to overcome drought, and achieving good harvests of crops even in disaster years.

    In 1964, Daqiao encountered a severe drought with more than 100 days of no rain, and the cotton land still produced 104 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This was a huge victory for the people of Daqiao in protecting cotton for the country, and also an epitome of their struggle against nature for more than ten years.

    In late July of that year, Daqiao experienced a twenty-eight-day midsummer drought, followed by a seventy-eight-day autumn drought. This was historically rare. The people of Daqiao were not intimidated by the drought demon. As soon as the midsummer drought began, they went to Chi Lake to carry lake water and harvest lake grass, fighting bitterly against the drought for more than 100 days.

        Carrying Heavy Burdens for the Country

    Daqiao is a cotton-producing area, and in the past, the state had to supply one or two hundred thousand jin of grain every year. After the establishment of the elementary cooperative, many cooperative members said: We rely on the state to supply our rations every year, which increases the burden on the state. We must strive to increase cotton production, and also try to increase grain production. However, in Daqiao, the soil is thin and the land is scarce, with an average of only one mu of land per person. Besides growing cotton, where can we find land to grow grain? Some people advocated intercropping cotton and wheat. But in the past, some people had tried it, and both cotton and wheat yields were very low. Most people believed that the production conditions were much better now than in the past, and advocated trying again.

    The cooperative committee supported the opinion of the majority and decided to simultaneously reclaim some barren mountains and lake land, and conduct scientific experiments on cotton and wheat intercropping. Hu Huaxian and veteran farmer Hu Maowu and others formed a scientific experimental group, starting in 1953, and continuously conducted experiments in this area.

    After six years and four experiments, the people of Daqiao finally succeeded in the cotton and wheat intercropping cultivation experiment after three failures.

    Starting in the winter of 1959, the Daqiao Brigade comprehensively promoted the new technology of wheat wide-row strip sowing with wide spacing, and the area of cotton and wheat intercropping gradually expanded, and now there are more than 590 mu. At the same time, with the continuous improvement of the soil, the increase in fertilizer, and the continuous improvement of cultivation techniques, they finally won a double high yield of two crops of cotton and wheat. Since 1961, Daqiao has realized the desire for self-sufficiency in grain in the cotton-producing area. Last year, the 590 mu of intercropped wheat achieved an average yield of more than 316 jin per mu.

                  ＊　＊　＊

    The people of Daqiao, looking back on the road they have traveled in the past twelve years, feel that they have taken the right path. But they are not satisfied. Everyone said: National construction is developing day by day, and our contribution to the country is still too small. The water conservancy problem has not been fundamentally solved, and it is still difficult to further achieve stable and high yields of cotton and grain. We should combine "iron shoulders" with modernization. Build pumping stations on the lakeside, and open up winding canals on the mountains, transforming carrying water up the mountain into diverting water up the mountain.

    Now, the people of Daqiao, carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution, have built a pumping station at the foot of Yangjia Mountain, and opened up more than one li of winding canals on the mountain, launching the prelude to marching towards modern agriculture and further building stable and high-yield farmland.

    一双铁肩改天换地
    ——记江西瑞昌大桥大队改良红壤实现棉花高产的斗争
    江西瑞昌县大桥公社大桥大队的干部和社员，以国为怀，在瘠薄、苦旱的红壤山地上，艰苦奋斗十二年，使棉花连年大面积高产，同时粮食自给有余，对国家作出重大贡献。
    大桥的七百多亩棉地，大部分分布在赣北赤湖西岸的二十一个支离破碎的红壤山岗上。解放前，人们形容它是“地在黄土尖，水等落雨天，吃饭没有田，穿衣收不到棉”的穷地方。
    解放后，大桥人组织起来，依靠自己的双肩和两手，把红壤瘠地变成了黑壤沃土，战胜了两个五十多天不雨的中旱年和三个一百多天不雨的大旱年，使全大队的七百多亩棉地，连续四年亩产皮棉百斤以上。去年亩产皮棉高达一百五十斤，比解放那年增长七倍多，比合作化前增长两倍多。全大队六百四十多亩小麦（其中有五百九十亩小麦与棉花套种），去年平均亩产三百多斤，比前年增长百分之八十二，比合作化前增长近两倍。近几年来，全大队每人每年平均卖给国家皮棉九十多斤；从一九六一年起，全大队的粮食已经自给有余。
          地穷肩膀硬
    一九五三年冬，是大桥人组织起来改造红壤瘠地的起点。
    当时，大桥下村三十三户农民，在大桥的第一个共产党员、现在的大队党支部书记胡华先的领导下，组织起第一个初级农业生产合作社。农业社一成立，许多社员迫不及待地要求改造红壤瘠地，改变棉花低产面貌。要改造酸性重、蓄水性能差的红壤瘠地，就要施用大量的肥料，加深土层，疏松土壤结构，增加有机质。可是，附近都是光山秃岭，缺少肥源。单靠农家肥，远远不能满足需要。
    怎么办呢？有人说：到山下赤湖去戽湖泥，捞湖草，挑肥上山。
    可是，地这样分散，土这样瘠薄，要挑多少年才能使土变厚，使地变肥呢？
    通过讨论，人们的思想统一了。大桥人就冒着严冬，在万家汊下湖，揭开了挑泥改土的序幕。
    在湖里，几十个男女社员光着脚，站在冰冷的烂泥里，挥动铁锹，把泥草戽上岸来。
    在岸上，另一批社员用土箕挑起泥草，迎着寒风，爬坡登山，送到红壤地上。许多人一天挑十六七担，每次来回要走三里多路。人们的肩膀磨得红肿。但没有人叫苦。
    从这年冬天到一九五四年秋天，大桥人首先给近湖的四十多亩红壤山地每亩铺上了三百五十多担湖泥、一百多担湖草。结果，这年这些地棉花产量比上一年增产百分之三十一。
    首战告捷，大大鼓舞了大桥人。到一九六二年，许多近湖的红壤山地，由瘦变肥，由薄变厚，由红变黑，棉花产量也有了显著提高。但是，还有不少离湖较远的地，仍然比较瘠薄。面对这些情况，有些人认为：反正现在有吃有穿了，歇两年不挑也可以过得去，何必这样苦？针对这种思想，党支部组织全体社员开展一次“为谁挑泥，为谁苦？”的讨论。
    大桥人通过忆苦思甜，展望未来，眼界开阔了，觉悟提高了。再挑泥改土，仿佛肩膀上挑的不是泥巴，而是一担担棉花和粮食，挑的是支援国家建设的重担。
    从一九五三年冬天到现在，大桥人整整挑了十二年的湖泥、湖草。全大队在二十一个山岗上的七百多亩红壤地，土层由薄变厚，由瘦变肥，由红变黑。土壤的初步改良，使棉花产量逐年上升。大桥人改造红壤瘠地、改变低产面貌的愿望，今天终于实现了。
          天旱地不旱
    大桥人凭着这股“铁肩膀”精神，在改造红壤的同时，还同干旱进行了顽强的斗争。
    水是农业的命脉，红壤瘠地更需要大量的水。可是，大桥这地方，虽说近在赤湖边，然而地在山上，湖在山下，地高水低，可望不可及。因此，解放前十天半月不雨就闹旱，五十多天不雨就成灾。
    解放后，特别是合作化以后，大桥人再也不听天由命了。他们说：过去种棉，是为自己活命；现在种棉，是支援国家建设。不管天旱不旱，既要种好，更要保收。没有水，就到赤湖里去挑。
    十二年来，他们小旱小挑，大旱大挑，冒着酷暑骄阳，忍热受渴，用汗水战胜了干旱，使灾年农作物也获得好收成。
    一九六四年，大桥遇到一百多天不雨的大旱，而棉地仍然亩产皮棉一百零四斤。这是大桥人为国保棉的巨大胜利，也是他们十多年来与天斗争的一个缩影。
    这年七月下旬，大桥发生了二十八天不雨的伏旱，接着又是七十八天不雨的秋旱。这是历史上罕见的。大桥人没有被旱魔吓倒。伏旱一开始，他们便到赤湖去挑湖水，捞湖草，同干旱苦斗了一百多天。
        为国家挑重担
    大桥是产棉区，过去每年都要国家供应一二十万斤粮食。初级社成立后，许多社员说：我们年年由国家供应口粮，加重了国家的负担。我们要努力增产棉花，也要想办法增产粮食。可是，大桥这地方，土薄地少，平均每人只有一亩多地。除了种棉以外，哪里有地种粮食呢？有人主张：棉麦套种。可是过去有人试过，棉麦产量都很低。多数人认为，现在生产条件比过去好多了，主张再试一试。
    社委会支持了多数人的意见，决定一面开垦一部分荒山湖地，一面进行棉麦套种的科学试验。胡华先同老农胡茂武等组成科学试验小组，从一九五三年开始，不断进行这方面的试验。
    大桥人经过六个年头，四次试验，三次失败，棉麦套种的耕作试验终于成功了。
    从一九五九年冬开始，大桥大队全面推广了小麦宽行条播宽幅的新技术，棉麦套种的面积逐年扩大，到现在已有五百九十多亩。同时，随着土壤的不断改良，肥料的增加和栽培技术的不断改善，终于夺得了棉麦两熟双高产。从一九六一年起，大桥实现了产棉区粮食自给有余的愿望。去年套种的五百九十亩小麦，平均亩产高达三百一十六斤以上。
                  ＊　＊　＊
    大桥人回顾十二年来走过的道路，觉得走对了。但是他们并不满足。大家说：国家建设一天天在发展，我们对国家的贡献还是太小了。水利问题没有根本解决，棉粮要进一步做到稳产高产还有困难。我们应该“铁肩膀”加现代化。在湖边修建抽水机站，在山上开起盘山渠道，把挑水上山变为引水上山。
    现在大桥人发扬不断革命精神，在杨家山脚下建起了一座抽水机站，在山上开出了一里多长的盘山渠道，揭开了向现代化农业进军、进一步建设稳产高产农田的序幕。
