    Entrepreneurs
    ——Profiles from the Xiadingjia Brigade
    The Soldier Who Never Retires – On Wang Yongxing, Secretary of the Brigade General Branch
  Stepping onto the soil of his hometown,
  Hearing the sounds of his hometown,
  Touching the trees of his hometown,
  Seeing the people of his hometown,
  Ah, he has returned,
  A soldier on a long expedition,
  Bearing scars,
  Bearing lofty sentiments,
  Bearing a radiant ideal,
  Bearing the determination of revolution.
A rainstorm had just passed, leaving disaster in its wake, the collapsed embankments, the uprooted seedlings, like iron nails, pierced his eyes. He strode quickly into the village, handing his introduction letter to the branch, and with it, a fighting heart. He had only one sentence: Carry the revolution through to the end. He had only one action: March toward the poor mountains and bad waters. He used Mao Zedong Thought to organize and mobilize the masses, on the fields,
  Planning the blueprint for transforming the mountainous area,
  In the valleys,
  Listening to the voices of the old farmers,
  Carrying soil, ramming earth,
  He and the masses split open stubborn rocks,
  Bringing water to the mountain top,
  A silver river winds around the mountainside,
  Barren mountains are green, and water is sentimental,
  He and the villagers stand shoulder to shoulder,
  He and the commune members are heart to heart.
  Some say he has retired,
  No, his answer is "enlist,"
  Some say he has been demobilized,
  No, his answer is "charge,"
  On the long expedition,
  He is a soldier who never fades.

  On the Yongwen River
   ——On Zhang Shuqin, Brigade Leader
  Wind rolling the snow,
  Snow accompanying the wind,
  The people of Xiadingjia cutting off the Yongwen River,
  A red flag fights in the wind.
  The rolling roar of the waves gives the order,
  Ordering the commune members to stop work quickly.
  To dam the river, how can we stop work,
  A loud shout like thunder,
  A large man leaps up in mid-air,
  Landing upright in the rushing current,
  This large man,
  Killed enemies twenty years ago,
  An eagle in a hail of bullets,
  Sneaking into enemy bunkers to scout enemy positions,
  Near death and reborn in wartime.
  The old hero leads the new soldiers,
  Leaping into the water is like an order,
  In an instant, the water is filled with people,
  A human wall boils with blood,
  The fickle Yongwen River,
  Never thought it would change its nature today,
  A dam rises before the heroes,
  A mirror of gentle ripples,
  A bright mirror reflecting the mountains,
  The green hills have the aura of heroes.

   "A Lock"
    ——On Liu Xinchun, Chairman of the Poor Peasants' Association
      Liu Xinchun is known as a "collective fanatic," also called "A Lock." Don't look at his age, his heart is like a ball of fire. The dam's work songs are loud, the youth are working hard, the elders ask each other: "What can we do?" He fills a basket with soil, bends over, and carries it on his shoulder, running all the way to the dam, an old man in his fifties fighting like a young man. Called a "collective fanatic," also called "A Lock." The orchard on the hillside is being harvested now, carrying 10,000 saplings, in the autumn wind, the large pears fill the mountain with gold, putting a lock on the high mountain. Naughty children tease the old man, climbing to the treetops to pick fruit, one person picking a pear, testing this mountain-sealing lock. Reaching out to pick a second one, smiling in the green leaves: "This yellow pear belongs to the commune, no one is allowed to pick one privately."

    创业人
    ——下丁家大队人物志
    孔林永不退伍的士兵——记大队总支书记
    王永幸
  踏上故乡的土，
  听到故乡的音，
  摸摸故乡的树，
  看看故乡的人，
  啊，他回来了，
  一位远征的士兵，
  带着伤疤，
  带着豪情，
  带着光辉的理想，
  带着革命的决心。一场暴雨刚刚落过，家乡地下留着灾情，那倒塌的地堰，那冲起的禾根，象一根根铁钉，刺痛了他的眼睛。他急迈步，走进村，把介绍信交给支部，同时交出一颗战斗的心。他只有一句话，革命到底，他只有一个举动，向穷山恶水进军。他用毛泽东思想，组织发动群众，在地头上，
  规划改造山区的远景，
  在山峪里，
  听取老农的声音，
  担土，打夯，
  他与群众劈开顽石，
  把水头拉到高山顶，
  一道银河缠山腰，
  荒山翠绿水有情，
  他和乡亲肩并肩，
  他同社员心贴心。
  有人说，他退伍了，
  不，他回答是“报名”，
  有人说，他复员了，
  不，他回答是“冲锋”，
  在远征途上，
  他是个永不褪色的士兵。
  泳汶河上
   ——记大队长张书勤
  风卷着雪，
  雪伴着风，
  下丁家人腰斩泳汶河，
  一杆红旗风里斗。
  滚滚涛声下命令，
  命令社员快收工。
  要截流，怎收工，
  一声巨喊似雷鸣，
  半空里跃起一大汉，
  落身直立激流中，
  这大汉，
  二十年前杀敌寇，
  枪林弹雨一只鹰，
  奇袭敌堡探敌情，
  战时几死又复生。
  老英雄带新兵，
  跃身下水似命令，
  刹时水中人一片，
  一道人墙血沸腾，
  喜怒无常的泳汶河，
  怎想今朝改本性，
  英雄面前大坝起，
  微波细浪一面镜，
  一面明镜照山峦，
  青山那有人威风。
   “一把锁”
    ——记贫协主席
      刘新春人称“集体迷”，又喊“一把锁”，别看年纪大，心似一团火。大坝号子响，青年干的泼，老年相互问：“咱可怎么着？”他铲满一筐土，弯腰肩上托，一路小跑上大堤，五十岁的老年战小伙。人称“集体迷”，又喊“一把锁”，满坡果林眼下收，怀揣树苗一万棵，秋风里大梨满山金，高山打上一把锁。顽皮的孩子逗老汉，爬上树梢去摘果，一人摘下一个梨，试试这把封山锁。伸手要摘第二个，绿叶丛中笑呵呵：“这黄梨它是公社的，私人不许摘一个。”
