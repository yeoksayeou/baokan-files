    Product of US-Soviet Cooperation, Extension of US-Japan Cooperation
    Soviet Leaders Flatter Sato Government to Intensify Collusion
    *Akahata* Exposes Sato Government's "Rapprochement with the Soviet Union" to Further Antagonize China
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 15th: The Japanese Sato government, acting according to American intentions, after establishing "diplomatic relations" with the South Korean puppet group, then initialed a Japan-Soviet aviation agreement with the Soviet Union on the 15th.

    According to reports, while initialing the Japan-Soviet aviation agreement, the Japan-Soviet trade agreement is about to be initialed, and negotiations on the Japan-Soviet consular agreement are also being accelerated. Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina will formally sign these agreements during his visit to Moscow and make advance arrangements for Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato's visit to the Soviet Union. Sato has repeatedly received invitations from Soviet Premier Kosygin and is preparing to visit Moscow in the second half of this year.

    The Sato government's strengthening of its exchanges with the Soviet Union is being carried out under American authorization. According to the *Economist* magazine of December 21st of last year, when Sato met with Johnson in January of last year, Johnson personally instructed him, saying: "Instead of solving the Japan-China issue, it would be better to solve the Japan-Soviet issue first." This magazine pointed out that "the current Japan-Soviet relationship is an extension of the Japan-US relationship and can also be regarded as a form of US-Soviet cooperation."

    The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper *Akahata* revealed on November 26th of last year that the Sato government's recent intensification of its "rapprochement with the Soviet Union" policy is to follow the US-Soviet cooperation line, further antagonize China, and is "following the Johnson administration and responding to its instigation."

    The Japanese bourgeois newspapers also do not conceal the Sato government's intention to approach the Soviet Union. The *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* said on November 14th of last year that the Sato government is "devoting all its efforts to solving the Japan-Soviet relationship problem" after the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" because the Soviet Union "has strengthened its activities of peaceful coexistence with the United States and other liberalist camps." The newspaper said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that "this attitude of the Soviet Union is a link in isolating China," so Japan "should take the opportunity to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union" in order to contain "the CCP." The *Economist* magazine of November 30th of last year also said: Japan's "approach to the Soviet Union is synonymous with attempting to weaken China in Asia and Africa."

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 15th: After a long period of negotiations, the Soviet Union and Japan initialed the Japan-Soviet aviation agreement in Tokyo on the 15th.

    The Soviet delegation, led by Danilichev, Director of the International Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Civil Aviation, has been holding negotiations with senior officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo since October of last year. According to Kyodo News, in the final stage of the negotiations, the two sides finally reached an agreement because "the Soviet side fully accepted Japan's counter-proposals."

    According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency, the agreement stipulates that Japanese and Soviet airlines will jointly operate air transport between Tokyo and Moscow; before the Soviet Union opens Siberia to capitalist countries, as a temporary measure, Soviet aircraft and Japanese and Soviet flight personnel will be used to fly over Siberia within two years; but after two years, both parties will use their own aircraft and pilots. In order to adapt to the air traffic between Japan and the Soviet Union, the two sides also decided to open a direct telex line between Tokyo and Moscow.

    The *Japan Newspaper Weekly* reported not long ago that the Japan-Soviet aviation agreement, which has been an outstanding issue since 1958, is now proceeding so smoothly mainly due to the Soviet Union's concessions. Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina also told reporters that Japan "never expected (the Soviet Union) to make concessions to this extent."

    At the same time, according to Kyodo News, the Japan-Soviet trade talks, which have been held in Tokyo since December 9th of last year, have reached an agreement in principle. The news agency said, "Before Foreign Minister Shiina departs for the Soviet Union on the 15th, the two major outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union have been resolved one after another, and Japan-Soviet diplomacy will make great concrete progress against the background of the Japan-Soviet friendly atmosphere since last year."

    The new development in Japan-Soviet relations is the result of the Soviet Union's new leaders actively promoting the strengthening of collusion with the Sato government. Soviet Premier Kosygin emphasized in his written reply to the questions raised by Iwamoto Kiyoshi, Managing Director of Kyodo News, on December 31st of last year that the development of Soviet-Japanese relations in 1965 was extremely beneficial, and he believed that this relationship would become more concrete in 1966; the development of Soviet-Japanese relations has made it easier for the two countries to cooperate in solving international problems. The Soviet representative who participated in the Japan-Soviet aviation agreement negotiations also repeatedly stated to Japan: "The conclusion of the aviation agreement will promote the comprehensive development of Japan-Soviet relations in other fields."

    The *Economist* magazine recently reported that Japanese business leaders believe that the Soviet Union needs Japanese funds, technology, and machinery products in the implementation of its new five-year plan, especially in the development of Siberia.

### 美苏合作的产物　美日合作的延长  苏联领导讨好佐藤政府加紧互相勾结  《赤旗报》揭露佐藤政府“接近苏联”是为了进一步敌视中国

    美苏合作的产物　美日合作的延长
    苏联领导讨好佐藤政府加紧互相勾结
    《赤旗报》揭露佐藤政府“接近苏联”是为了进一步敌视中国
    新华社十五日讯　东京消息：按照美国意旨办事的日本佐藤政府，在同南朝鲜傀儡集团建立了“外交关系”之后，接着在十五日同苏联草签了日苏航空协定。
    据报道，在草签日苏航空协定的同时，日苏贸易协定即将草签，日苏领事协定的谈判也在加紧进行。日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎在访问莫斯科时，正式签署这些协定，并为日本首相佐藤荣作的访苏作事先安排。佐藤已多次接到苏联部长会议主席柯西金的邀请，准备在今年下半年访问莫斯科。
    佐藤政府加强同苏联的交往，是在美国授意下进行的。据去年十二月二十一日的《经济学人》周刊透露，佐藤在去年一月同约翰逊会谈时，约翰逊曾面授机宜说：“与其解决日中问题，倒不如先解决日苏问题”。这家周刊指出，“现阶段的日苏关系就是日美关系的延长，也可以认为是美苏合作的一种形态”。
    日共机关报《赤旗报》在去年十一月二十六日揭露，最近以来佐藤政府加紧推行“接近苏联”政策，是追随美苏合作路线，进一步敌视中国，是
  “追随约翰逊政府和响应它的策动”。
    日本资产阶级报刊也不隐讳佐藤政府接近苏联的意图。《日本经济新闻》在去年十一月十四日说，佐藤政府所以在“日韩条约”之后“全力以赴地解决日苏关系问题”，是由于苏联“同美国等自由主义阵营加强了和平共处的活动”。报纸说，日本外务省认为“苏联的这种态度是孤立中国的一环”，因此日本“应乘机同苏联缔结和约”，以便牵制“中共”。去年十一月三十日的《经济学人》杂志也说：日本“接近苏联，就是企图在亚、非削弱中国的同义语”。
    新华社十五日讯　东京消息：苏联同日本在经过长期谈判后，十五日在东京草签了日苏航空协定。
    由苏联民航部国际局长达尼利切夫率领的苏联代表团，从去年十月以来就同日本外务省的高级官员们，在东京举行谈判。据共同社报道，在谈判的最后阶段，由于“苏联方面全面地接受了日本的反建议”，双方终于达成协议。
    据日本共同社报道，这项协定规定由日本和苏联的航空公司共同经营东京—莫斯科之间的航空运输；在苏联没有对资本主义国家开放西伯利亚之前，作为临时措施，在两年内使用苏联飞机和日苏两国飞行人员飞越西伯利亚；但在两年后，双方将各自使用本国的飞机和驾驶员。为了适应日苏之间的通航，双方并决定开辟东京—莫斯科的直达电传线路。
    《日本新闻周报》不久前报道说，从一九五八年以来一直成为悬案的日苏航空协定，目前进行得这样顺利，主要是由于苏联的让步。日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎也曾经对新闻记者说，日本“完全没有想到（苏联）会让步到这种程度”。
    同时，据共同社报道，从去年十二月九日起在东京举行的日苏贸易谈判，原则上已达成协议。这家通讯社说，“在十五日椎名外务大臣启程访苏之前，日苏间两大悬案接连得到解决，日苏外交将以去年以来的日苏友好气氛为背景，取得很大的具体进展。”
    日苏关系的新发展，是苏联新领导积极推行的加强同佐藤政府勾结的结果。苏联部长会议主席柯西金在去年十二月三十一日答复共同社专务理事岩本清向他提出的书面问题时强调说，一九六五年苏日关系的发展极其有益，相信一九六六年这种关系将会更加具体化；苏日关系的发展，已经使两国在解决国际问题时容易实行合作。参加日苏航空协定谈判的苏联代表也一再向日本表示：“航空协定达成协议，会推动其他领域日苏关系的全面发展”。
    《经济学人》杂志最近报道，日本财界首脑认为，苏联在执行新五年计划时，特别是在开发西伯利亚方面需要日本的资金、技术和机械制品。
