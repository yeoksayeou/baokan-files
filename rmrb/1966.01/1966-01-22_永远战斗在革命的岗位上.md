    Forever Fight at the Revolutionary Post
    I am determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to the Party, stand as firm as a refining tower on the earth and under the blue sky, be a never-rusting screw, and fight on the high oil tower.
    Spending the New Year on the high refining tower is a first for me in my life. Looking at the groups of huge oil tanks, the towering refining towers, and listening to the trains rumbling towards all parts of the motherland, fully loaded with oil products, I feel boundless pride and honor in my heart!
    Tank farm, tower forest, sea of lights, what a mighty lineup! The roaring vertical giant furnace and the machine pump that spins thousands upon thousands of times per minute, show what heroic strides the giant is taking!
    Everything before my eyes fills my mind with many past events. This day last year, I, an eighteen-year-old girl living in the city, was still acting spoiled and coddled in front of my mother, like a child. But today, this year, I have been tempered and improved in this revolutionary melting pot of Daqing, and have become a refinery worker. Every time I stand on this high refining tower, my vision becomes infinitely broad, it seems as if I have the entire motherland in my heart, and I often think of the other side of the ocean - thinking of the two-thirds of the world's people who live under the iron heel of imperialism. At this time, I think I will never be willful or quarrel with my mother again about the quality of a meal or the style of a piece of clothing. I realize that this thick cotton work uniform I wear is the best and most beautiful clothing. The cold wind can't penetrate it, and the frost and snow can't freeze it. I want to wear it, listen to the Party, read Chairman Mao's books, always stick to my fighting post, serve the people of the world for the rest of my life, and be a good successor to the revolution.
    What the squad leader said is correct: "Sticking to our posts is doing revolution. Refining towers, machine pumps, and pipelines are our revolutionary weapons. In the new year, we must use them better, refine more oil, and refine good oil!"
    The east is dawning, the rising sun is up, and in the first ray of sunshine of the new year, our refinery looks even more solemn and beautiful. It is full of vitality and is flourishing, how much I love our refining tower! In order to build a prosperous and strong socialist motherland, I want to stand as firm as a refining tower on the earth and under the blue sky, be a never-rusting screw, and fight on the high refining tower.
    Liu Fengling, Worker of the Thermal Cracking Workshop, Daqing Refinery

    永远战斗在革命的岗位上
    我决心读毛主席的书，听党的话，象炼塔一样挺立在大地上、蓝天下，做一个永不生锈的螺丝钉，战斗在高高的油塔上
    在高高的炼油塔上过新年，这是我有生以来的第一次。我看着那一群群巨大的油罐，一座座高耸的炼油塔，听着那满载油品的轰隆隆的驰向祖国四方的列车，我的心头感到无限的骄傲和自豪！
    罐区、塔林、灯海，多么威武的阵容！那轰隆隆震响的立式巨炉，那一分钟飞转成千上万次的机泵，又显示多么豪迈的巨人的步伐啊！
    眼前的一切，使我的思想涌上了许多往事。去年的今天，我这个身居城市的十八岁的姑娘，还象一个孩子在妈妈跟前任性、撒娇。可是，今年的今天，却在大庆这座革命的熔炉里，得到了锻炼和提高，成了一名炼油工人。每当我站在这高高的炼塔上，视野就变得无限的开阔，怀里似乎装着整个的祖国，心里常常想到大海的彼岸——想到那生活在帝国主义铁蹄下的世界上三分之二的人民。这时，我想再也不会为一餐饭的好坏，一件衣裳的式样，跟妈妈任性、争吵了。认识到我身上这套厚厚的棉工服，是最好最美的衣裳。它寒风吹不透，霜雪冻不着，我要穿着它，听党的话，读毛主席的书，永远坚守着战斗的岗位，为世界人民服务一辈子，当好革命的接班人。
    班长的话说得对，“坚守岗位就是干革命，炼塔、机泵、管线，就是我们革命的武器。在新的一年里，我们要更好地运用它，多炼油、炼好油！”
    东方破晓了，旭日升起来了，在新年的第一道阳光里咱们的炼油厂显得更加庄严、美丽。它生气勃勃，蒸蒸日上，我多么热爱咱们的炼油塔啊！为了建设一个繁荣、富强的社会主义的祖国，我要象炼塔那样挺立在大地上、蓝天下，做一颗永不生锈的螺丝钉，战斗在高高的炼油塔上。
