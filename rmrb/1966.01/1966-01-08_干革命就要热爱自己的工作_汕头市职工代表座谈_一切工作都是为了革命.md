    To Engage in Revolution, One Must Love One's Work
    —Shantou City Worker Representatives Discuss "All Work Is for the Revolution"

    Following the publication of *The People's Daily* editorial "All Work Is for the Revolution," the Shantou City Federation of Trade Unions in Guangdong Province convened a symposium of worker representatives to discuss their understanding and experiences after studying it. The symposium was attended by twenty-three advanced producers and worker representatives from factories, enterprises, stores, hospitals, and schools. Through the symposium, the representatives received a profound socialist education and expressed their determination to return to their posts and love their work, as well as to educate and influence the surrounding masses and the younger generation to establish the idea that all work is for the revolution, and to do a good job in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The following are excerpts from the speeches of several comrades at the meeting.

    Zhuang Yajiao, a drainage worker from the Shantou Municipal Engineering Company, said: Drainage work is a strenuous manual labor, dealing with dark sewers all day long. In the cold winter, we have to fight in waist-deep cold water, and in the summer, we have to stand on the road under the scorching sun. In the old society, this kind of hard labor was considered a lowly job. Even now, some people think that this line of work "has no future" and is "not glorious." At first, I also complained that I had no education or skills, so I had to do this unpromising job. After liberation, my thinking changed, but I still had the concept of being hired, thinking that since I was paid by the state, I should do the work well. I did not realize that drainage work was also doing revolution. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I truly understood the reason for whom I was laboring. The editorial of *The People's Daily* helped me realize that drainage work is a division of labor in socialist construction, and it is also revolutionary work. Clearing the ditches, reducing mosquitoes, and preventing infectious diseases to protect people's health is serving the people. In this way, my enthusiasm for work has been much greater than in the past.

    Zhuang Yingqing, a nurse from Shantou Workers' Hospital, said: I am a new recruit who graduated from nursing school in 1963 and started working. In the past, I heard people say that nurses are "high-class maids" and do a humble job. When I first started working, I thought, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, a white-clothed warrior nurtured by the Party, and I should actively serve the people. But I did not realize that nursing work is also doing revolution. When I started working, although I said "being a nurse is good," I didn't really believe it in my heart. When I encountered some patients who lost their temper, I took a perfunctory attitude and just finished my eight hours of work. Later, after studying "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I realized that serving patients is also doing revolution. I thought, nursing is also part of medical work. If there is a slight negligence in the work, it will cause pain or even death to the patient. If we care for the sick and wounded and enable them to recover their health as soon as possible, this is also for socialist construction. The more I studied Chairman Mao's works, the brighter my heart became, and I gradually established the class feelings of the workers and peasants, regarding reducing the suffering of patients as my greatest pleasure. In the past two years, there have been no accidents in my nursing work.

    Wu Wenxian, a teacher from Shantou City Waima Road No. 1 Kindergarten, said: “In the past, some teachers thought that kindergarten work was looked down upon, being 'high-class nannies,' taking care of children all day long, and there was no future. Therefore, they did not pay close attention to early childhood education, safety work, and contact with families. After studying the editorial of *The People's Daily*, I realized that kindergarten work is also doing revolution. We believe that according to the Party's educational policy, educating children well so that parents can do a good job in work and production is supporting socialist construction; we also clarified that we must strengthen the moral, intellectual, and physical education of children. We often tell children revolutionary stories to cultivate their noble thoughts and morals. We also cut their hair, bathe them, take them to see a doctor, assign people to take them home after school, and sew clothes for them so that parents can concentrate on their work. We realize that all work is a social division of labor, with no distinction between high and low, and we are determined to do a good job in kindergarten work.

    Wu Ying, a salesperson from the Shantou City Coal Construction Company, said: After studying the principle that all work is for the revolution, I realized that selling coal is also doing revolution. I thought of ways to serve customers as well as possible. For three years, I have insisted on delivering coal to the homes of military dependents, martyrs' families, pregnant women, and the elderly, weak, disabled, and users lacking labor, and I have dispatched service vehicles to sell coal door-to-door. Once, I even carried coal to the home of a woman who had just given birth, helped her child go to the grain store and police station to register the birth, and bought charcoal and sundries on her behalf. In order to make it easier and safer for the masses to burn coal, I also mobilized users to switch to briquette stoves when selling coal. Sometimes I went to users' homes to help light the fire, add coal, and demonstrate and explain, so that they could master the usage. When I learned that some users' stove doors were damaged, I used my spare time to find mud, learn to make stove doors, and give them to users for free, which moved them very much.

    Zhang Liangkun, production team leader of Shantou Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory, said: All work is for the revolution is a question of revolutionary world outlook. Only by consciously engaging in revolution can we make extraordinary contributions to the people in ordinary posts. In our factory, why was it that when the factory was built in 1958, the machines were new, but production was always not good and there were losses; and now, after so many years of using the equipment, not only can the output be increased, but the quality has also been greatly improved, and it has been listed among the advanced ranks of small and medium-sized sugar factories in the country? The problem lies in the fact that the workers have adhered to the principle of putting Mao Zedong Thought in command. Take our Tingqing team, for example. When the factory was built, four heating pumps had to be repaired in less than ten days of operation. Now, all four heating pumps can run for several months, and they don't need to be repaired for the entire pressing season. This is the result of the change in people's thinking. After studying Chairman Mao's works, everyone's class consciousness has been raised, and they have realized that the country has entrusted us with machinery and equipment, and the country trusts us so much. How can we be worthy of the Party and the people if we don't do a good job? With the idea that all work is for the revolution, there will be enough enthusiasm and more methods.

### 干革命就要热爱自己的工作——汕头市职工代表座谈“一切工作都是为了革命”

    干革命就要热爱自己的工作
    ——汕头市职工代表座谈“一切工作都是为了革命”
    《人民日报》的社论《一切工作都是为了革命》发表后，广东省汕头市总工会召开了职工代表座谈会，座谈学习后的认识和体会。参加座谈会的有工厂、企业、商店、医院、学校的先进生产者和职工代表共二十三人。到会代表通过座谈，受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，表示回到岗位以后，要热爱自己的工作，并教育和影响周围的群众以及青少年一代，树立一切工作都是为了革命的思想，搞好社会主义革命和社会主义建设。下面是几位同志在会上发言的摘录。
    汕头市政工程公司清沟工人庄亚角说：清沟工作是一种劳累的体力劳动，整天跟阴暗的下水道打交道，寒冬要在半身深的冷水里战斗，夏天，烈日当空要站在马路上干活。这种艰苦的劳动，在旧社会被认为是下贱的工作。现在也有人认为干这一行“没有前途”、“不光彩”。我开始也埋怨自己没有文化，没有本领，才干这没出息的活。解放后，我思想有了转变，但还存在雇佣观点，认为拿国家的工资就应当把活干好，对清沟工作也是干革命还没有认识。我学习了毛主席著作，才真正懂得了为谁劳动的道理。《人民日报》的社论又帮助我认识了清沟工作是社会主义建设的分工，也是革命工作，把沟渠疏通，蚊子减少，不发生传染病，保障人民身体健康，就是为人民服务。这样，我干活的劲头就比过去大多了。
    汕头工人医院护士庄映清说：我是一九六三年从卫生学校毕业参加工作的新兵。过去，听人说，护士是“高等婢女”，是低三下四的工作。刚参加工作时，我想，我是个共青团员，是党一手培养起来的白衣战士，应该积极为人民服务。但我并没有认识到护士的工作也是干革命。开始工作时，我口头虽说“当护士好”，可心里却不以为然。碰到有些病人发脾气，我就抱着应付的态度，干完八小时工作就算了。后来，学了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，我才知道侍候病人也是干革命。我想，护理也是医疗工作的一部分，工作要是有一点疏忽，就会给病人造成痛苦甚至死亡。要是爱护伤病员，使病员早日恢复健康，这也是为了社会主义建设。我越学毛主席著作心里越亮堂，逐渐树立了工农的阶级感情，把减轻病人的痛苦当作个人最大的愉快。两年多来，在护理工作中从没出过事故。
    汕头市外马路第一幼儿园教养员吴文娴说：“过去，有的教师认为幼儿园工作被人看不起，是“高级保姆”，终日带小孩，没有什么出息，因此，在幼儿教育、安全工作与家庭联系方面抓的不紧。学了《人民日报》社论后，认识到幼儿园工作也是干革命。我们认为根据党的教育方针，教育好孩子，使家长能搞好工作和生产，就是支援了社会主义建设；也明确了必须加强对孩子们进行德育、智育、体育的教育。我们经常给孩子们讲革命故事，培养他们高尚的思想品德。我们还给孩子理发、洗澡，带孩子看病，分工带小孩放学回家，为孩子缝补衣服，使家长们能集中精力搞好工作。我们认识到各项工作是社会分工，没有高低贵贱之分，决心做好幼儿园工作。
    汕头市煤建公司售货员吴瑛说：我学习了一切工作都是为了革命的道理之后，认识到卖煤炭也是干革命。我就想办法尽量为顾客服务得好些。三年来，我坚持为军烈属、孕产妇及老弱残废和缺乏劳动力的用户送煤上门，并出动服务车挨户卖煤。有一次，我还替一位产后在家的妇女挑煤上门，替她的小孩到粮店、派出所办理出生登记手续，并代买木炭、杂物等。为了使群众烧煤烧得更省、更安全，在卖煤时我还动员用户改用蜂窝煤炉。有时我就到用户家里去帮助生火、添煤，示范讲解，使她们掌握好用法。当我了解到用户有些炉门损坏后，就利用空闲时间找泥土，动手学做炉门，免费送给用户，用户很感动。
    汕头华侨糖厂生产小组长张亮坤说：一切工作都是为了革命，这是个革命世界观的问题，只有自觉革命，才能在平凡的岗位上为人民作出不平凡的贡献。我所在的工厂，为什么一九五八年建厂时，机器是新的，生产却老是搞不好，有亏损；而现在，设备用了这么多年，产量不但能增加，而且质量还大有提高，被列入了全国中小型糖厂的先进行列，问题就在于职工们坚持了毛泽东思想挂帅。拿我们汀清小组来说，建厂时四只加热泵，运行不了十天就要修理。现在呢，四只加热泵，全部都能运行几个月，整个榨季都用不着修理。这是人的思想转变的结果。学习毛主席著作后，大家的阶级觉悟提高了，认识到国家把机器设备交给了我们，国家这样信任我们，搞不好工作怎能对得起党，对得起人民。有了一切工作都是为革命的思想，干劲就足了，办法也就多了。
