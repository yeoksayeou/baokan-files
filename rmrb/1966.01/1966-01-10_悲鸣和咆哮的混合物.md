    After running around thirteen countries and regions, the Democratic Senate leader of the United States, Mansfield, returned home and issued a report on South Vietnam. This report is a mixture of whimpers and roars, and is a good supplement to the Johnson administration's so-called "Fourteen Point Plan."

    In his report, Mansfield helplessly admitted that the Johnson administration's massive troop increase in South Vietnam and the gradual "escalation" of the war "failed to repel the offensive of the Viet Cong"; many Asian countries "avoided direct involvement in the Vietnam conflict," and the longer the war dragged on and the wider its scope expanded, the more "pressure" the United States' relations with its "allies" in Asia and Western Europe would be. No country was willing to "provide assistance to the South Vietnam war effort." In a word, the United States' past attempt to salvage its defeat by expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam has suffered a miserable failure. This policy has not received support among its "allies," and there is no hope of dragging others down. The situation is very isolated. Therefore, Mansfield had to lament that the United States is facing a "difficult and painful choice."

    They can't win the war, and they are unwilling to withdraw. For US imperialism, the choice is indeed "difficult and painful." However, Johnson has obviously chosen the path of further expanding the war under the cover of a "peace" smokescreen. Mansfield believes that doing so is "worthwhile," although he also does not see the possibility of the United States expanding the war to "seek military victory," and admits that the United States' frantic expansion of the war in Asia is "enormously dangerous."

    Knowing that the war cannot be won, they still want to fight it; knowing that there is no way out for expanding the war, they are still determined to expand it. This is exactly the choice of the Johnson government today, which is determined by the unchangeable aggressive nature of US imperialism. Mansfield's report is just a helpless confession.

    It must be pointed out that the publication of the Mansfield report at this time is entirely to cooperate with the hoax and conspiracy that Johnson is vigorously engaging in. It attempts to use the threat of "unlimited expansion and intensification of the war" to strengthen the weight of Johnson's so-called "peace offensive." This is of course a waste of effort. Mansfield's confession can only make the people of the world see more clearly the great hoax and great conspiracy of the United States, and see clearly that US imperialism is following the path of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until its demise.

### 悲鸣和咆哮的混合物

    悲鸣和咆哮的混合物
    美国参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德跑了十三个国家和地区回国之后，发表了一个关于南越的报告。这个报告是一个悲鸣和咆哮的混合物，倒是约翰逊政府的所谓“十四点计划”的一份很好的补充材料。
    曼斯菲尔德在他的报告中，无可奈何地承认，约翰逊政府大举增兵南越和把战争逐步“升级”，“并未能击退越共的攻势”；许多亚洲国家“都避免直接卷入越南冲突”，战争拖得越久，范围扩得越大，美国同它在亚洲和西欧的“盟国”的关系“受到的压力就越大”，没有什么国家愿意“对南越战争努力提供援助”。一句话，美国过去以扩大侵越战争来挽救败局，是惨遭失败了，它的这种政策在“盟国”中得不到支持，拉人下去毫无指望，处境十分孤立。因此，曼斯菲尔德不得不发出悲叹说：美国正面临一个“困难而痛苦的选择”。
    打又打不赢，撤又不甘心。对美帝国主义来说，选择的确是“困难而痛苦”的。但是，约翰逊显然已经选择了在“和平”烟幕掩盖下进一步扩大战争的道路。曼斯菲尔德认为这样做是“值得的”，虽然他也看不到美国扩大战争可以“谋求军事胜利”的可能性，而且承认美国在亚洲疯狂扩大战争“危险是巨大的”。
    明知战争打不赢，还是要打；明知扩大战争没有出路，还决心要扩大，这正是约翰逊政府今天的抉择，它是美帝国主义不可改变的侵略本性所决定的。曼斯菲尔德的报告不过是一份无可奈何的供状罢了。
    必须指出，曼斯菲尔德报告在这个时候发表，完全是配合约翰逊正在大搞特搞的骗局和阴谋的。它企图用“战争无限制的扩大和加剧”这种威胁，来加强约翰逊的所谓“和平攻势”的分量。这当然是白费心机的。曼斯菲尔德的供状，只能使全世界人民更加看清楚美国的大骗局、大阴谋，看清楚美帝国主义是在按着捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败直至灭亡这样一条轨道走下去。
