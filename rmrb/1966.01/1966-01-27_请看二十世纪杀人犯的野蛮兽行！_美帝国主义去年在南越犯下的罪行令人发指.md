    Look at the Barbaric Atrocities of Twentieth-Century Murderers!
    The Heinous Crimes Committed by U.S. Imperialism in South Vietnam Last Year
    Editor's Note: This is a record of the crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys in South Vietnam in 1965, as reported by the Vietnam News Agency, and also a blood-soaked indictment by the Vietnamese people. From this, people can see that the U.S. murdering bandits in South Vietnam, from using modern weapons to kill and set fires, to using medieval barbaric methods of beheading and disemboweling, stop at nothing. Having suffered repeated disastrous defeats with their war tactics and failing to achieve their goals with "peace talks," U.S. imperialism, while preparing to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, is attempting to force the Vietnamese people into submission through inhumane slaughter. However, this will never succeed. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The more the reactionaries kill, the stronger the revolutionary forces become, and the closer the reactionaries get to their doom." The U.S. bandits' towering crimes have aroused even greater anger and deeper hatred among the Vietnamese people. They are turning hatred into strength, striking the enemy more forcefully, and accelerating the U.S. murdering bandits towards their final defeat.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th) According to the Vietnam News Agency, in 1965, while massive numbers of U.S. invading troops entered South Vietnam, the U.S. bandits and their lackeys committed many barbaric crimes against the people of South Vietnam.
    They conducted repeated "sweeps" in the liberated areas, barbarically bombing and shelling peaceful villages, massacring the people of South Vietnam in large numbers. They also blatantly spread chemical poisons and sprayed toxic gases into the shelters of the people of South Vietnam. The U.S. aggressors and their lackeys also carried out indiscriminate bombing and shelling of some villages in the areas they temporarily controlled, destroying temples, churches, hospitals, and schools on a large scale.
    The following are some typical incidents of persecution and suppression of the people of South Vietnam by the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys in 1965:

    请看二十世纪杀人犯的野蛮兽行！
    美帝国主义去年在南越犯下的罪行令人发指
    编者按：这是越南通讯社报道的美国侵略者及其走狗一九六五年在越南南方的罪行录，也是越南人民的血的控诉书。人们从这里可以看到，美国杀人强盗在越南南方，从用现代化武器杀人放火，到用中世纪的野蛮手段砍头剖腹，无所不用其极，这是何等残暴，何等野蛮！美帝国主义使用战争的一手接连遭到惨败，使用“和谈”的一手又不能得逞，因此，它在准备扩大侵越战争的同时，妄图用灭绝人性的残杀来迫使越南人民屈服。然而，这是永远也不能办到的。正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。”美国强盗的滔天罪行，激起了越南人民更大的愤怒和更深的仇恨。他们化仇恨为力量，更加有力地打击敌人，使美国杀人强盗加速走向最后的失败。
    据新华社河内二十六日电　据越南通讯社报道，一九六五年，在美国侵略军大量开进南越的同时，美国强盗及其走狗对越南南方人民犯下了许多野蛮的罪行。
