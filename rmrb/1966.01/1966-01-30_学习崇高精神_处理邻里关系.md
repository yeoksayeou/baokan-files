    After the People's Daily published the newsletter "Class Feelings Weigh a Thousand Pounds" on December 13th, the political office of the Quantai Coal Mine in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, organized family members to study and hold discussions twice. Many family members stated that they would take Cheng Chunlan and Zhang Yong'an as examples, handle relations between comrades and neighbors with a noble revolutionary spirit, and do a good job in the revolutionary cause.
    Li Jingzhen (Director of Family Affairs): This matter is so touching, and it is of great educational significance to our family members. Our Family Affairs Committee has a total of 486 households. In the previous period, many incidents of disunity among adults due to children fighting occurred. We must learn well from Cheng Chunlan and Zhang Yong'an. If we all had their revolutionary spirit, these situations would not have happened.
    Song Lanying: The child was raised for thirteen years and was accidentally pushed into the water and drowned. In the old society, this would have caused a huge uproar. Now, the child's parents are still comforting the other party. This is because they have deep proletarian feelings. In the future, when something happens to us, we should think about this matter and see how they handled it.
    Wu Jiying: Cheng Chunlan and Zhang Yong'an's thirteen-year-old child was accidentally pushed into the water and drowned by another child. This is truly more painful than having one's flesh cut off. However, in handling this matter, they always thought of the feelings between class sisters. They were all sufferers in the old society, so they understood the importance of proletarian unity. If this had happened in the old society, they would have demanded a life or at least compensation. Only in the new China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and among the proletariat, could such a thing occur.
    Wang Yuzhen: In the old society, the rich were favored, and the poor suffered. If a poor person hit a child from a rich family, even if they didn't kill them, just touching them could lead to family ruin. If a child from a rich family hit a child from a poor family, nothing would happen. In the old society, my younger brother was playing with the landlord's child and angered him with a word. The landlord's child knocked him down. After my father came, he was scolded severely. Now we must be like Cheng Chunlan, hating class enemies and loving class sisters.
    Xia Yuhua: Our group has a total of thirty-eight households. Adults often argue and fight because children argue and fight. People say that our group does less work and more arguing and fighting. After hearing the article "Class Feelings Weigh a Thousand Pounds," I thought that the reason why children's fights cause disunity among adults is that they don't see far enough, only caring about their own immediate interests, fearing that their own child will suffer. When they become protective, it causes disunity among adults. Some family members pull their children close and beat them, scolding them worse than they would a chicken or a dog, making the other party feel embarrassed; other family members come out to help their children argue because of children's fights, and there is no talk of class feelings. Compared with Cheng Chunlan, they are really far behind.
    Ni Delan: Cheng Chunlan and Zhang Yong'an think of the country, the people, the world, and class feelings. We often think of ourselves. If we could think more about the country and more about the collective, there wouldn't be so much arguing.
    Wang Guirong: When I first heard this, my heart was racing. It's like losing a finger, how can you not be sad? But then I thought about it, class feelings are very important. Those who come from the south and those who come from the north are all doing revolution. If we are doing revolution, we must maintain class unity with relatives and sisters.
    Wang Xiuyu: Who is happy when children's quarrels cause disunity among adults? Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries are happy. They want us to argue and be disunited all the time. Cheng Chunlan and Zhang Yong'an's own son was accidentally pushed into the water and drowned. How painful is that! But they thought of proletarian unity, saw far ahead, thought broadly, and suppressed their own grief, instead consoling the other party. Cheng Chunlan said to her husband: "Don't add to their pain, don't be angry, don't say anything." She said to Xu Jinxian: "Don't be sad, don't let this matter damage the feelings between us class sisters, our unity is important." She also said to Little Chongyang: "Don't let this matter damage your brain," and told him to study hard and contribute to the country in the future. Her thinking was also generated after studying Chairman Mao's works. We must take Cheng Chunlan as an example, study Chairman Mao's works well, and maintain unity.
    Li Jingzhen: Everyone's discussion is very good. In the future, we must take Cheng Chunlan and Zhang Yong'an as examples and maintain unity. Each group should organize all family members to study and discuss this well, handle relations between comrades and neighbors well, study Chairman Mao's works well, manage household affairs well, take good care of the workers, raise children well, and do a good job in revolutionary work.

### 学习崇高精神　处理邻里关系

专栏：

    学习崇高精神　处理邻里关系
    《人民日报》于十二月十三日刊登了《阶级感情千斤重》这篇通讯以后，江苏徐州权台煤矿政治处前后两次组织家属进行了学习和座谈。许多家属表示要以程春兰、张永安为榜样，以崇高的革命精神处理好同志之间、邻居之间的关系，搞好革命事业。
    李景珍（家属主任）：这件事情太感动人了，对我们家属的教育意义很大。咱们家属委员会共有四百八十六户。前一个时期，因小孩打架造成大人不团结的事情很多。我们要很好的学习程春兰和张永安。如果我们都有他们这种革命精神，就不会发生这种情况了。
    宋兰英：孩子已养活了十三年啦，被人失手推下水淹死了。要在旧社会，这能闹翻天。现在孩子的父母还安慰人家，这就是有深厚的无产阶级感情。咱以后有什么事，应该想想人家这个事，看看人家是怎么办的。
    吴继英：程春兰、张永安的十三岁的孩子被别人的孩子失手推下水淹死了，这真比割肉还疼。但是，他们处理这件事，是处处想着阶级姐妹间的感情，他们在旧社会都是受苦人，所以体会到无产阶级团结的重要。这件事若出在旧社会，不偿命也得赔钱。只有在新中国，在毛主席领导下，在无产阶级当中，才会出现这种事情。
    王玉珍：在旧社会出现这种事，有钱人吃香，穷人倒霉，穷人打了有钱人家的孩子，别说打死了，就是碰了他一下，也会造成家破人亡，有钱人家的孩子打了穷人的孩子，一点事也没有。在旧社会，我的大弟弟和地主小孩一块玩，一句话惹恼了地主孩子，被地主孩子摔倒。我父亲来以后，又把我父亲大骂一场。现在我们要象程春兰那样，对阶级敌人要恨，对阶级姐妹要爱。
    夏玉华：我们小组共有三十八户家属，经常因孩子吵架打架造成大人吵架打架，人家说俺小组干活少，吵架打架多。听了《阶级感情千斤重》这篇文章以后，我想，小孩打架造成大人不和睦的原因是，眼光看的不远，光看自己手心一点，恐怕自己的孩子吃了亏，一护短就造成大人不团结。有的家属把自己的孩子拉到跟前打一顿，比鸡骂狗把孩子骂一通，让人家下不来台；还有的家属，因孩子吵架，大人出来帮助吵，一点也谈不到什么阶级感情，这要比起人家程春兰，那真是差远啦。
    倪德兰：人家程春兰、张永安想的是国家，想的是人民，想的是世界，想的是阶级感情。咱们常常想的是个人，如果能多想着国家，多想着集体，就不会发生这么多吵架的。
    王桂荣：刚听了我心里光跳，十指连心嘛，哪能不难过？可是，再想想，阶级感情很重要，南来的，北往的，出来都同样是搞革命的。咱搞革命嘛，不管亲邻姐妹都要搞好阶级团结。
    王秀玉：因孩子吵架，造成大人不团结，这样谁高兴呢？地主、富农、反革命高兴，他们就希望我们整天吵架，闹不团结。人家程春兰、张永安的亲生儿子，被人失手推下水淹死了，这有多疼人！但是他们想的是无产阶级团结，看的远，想的宽，忍住了自己的伤心，反而去劝人家。程春兰对她丈夫说：不要给人家增加痛苦，千万不要生气，不要说什么啦。她对徐金仙说：你不要难过，不要为这件事伤害了我们阶级姐妹的感情，我们的团结要紧。她又对小重阳说，不要为这件事把自己的脑筋伤坏了，还让他用心读书，将来为国家出力。她这种思想，也是学习了毛主席著作以后产生的，我们一定要以程春兰为榜样，学好毛主席著作，搞好团结。
    李景珍：大家谈的都很好，今后咱们一定以程春兰、张永安为榜样，搞好团结。各小组要组织全体家属很好的学一学，讨论讨论，处理好同志之间、邻居之间的关系，学习好毛主席著作，搞好家务，照顾好工人，带好子女，干好革命工作。
