    Finding Particularity from Generality

    Doubt

    In October 1964, a few drops of water were found during gas measurement at well number 21 in the second row of our team. The experienced master worker said, "The water droplets are warning us that the oil well is seeing water." But no one believed that this well could see water, because everyone knew there was a general rule for oil wells seeing water: before seeing water, the oil pressure, flowing pressure, and static pressure all rise simultaneously, the production increases, and the casing pressure and oil-gas ratio decrease. But our well exhibited an abnormal phenomenon: the static pressure, flowing pressure, and oil pressure did not rise but decreased, and the casing pressure and oil-gas ratio did not decrease but increased; the production did not increase but decreased. These phenomena were exactly the opposite of the general phenomena before an oil well sees water. How could it be seeing water? If we didn't acknowledge it was seeing water, we clearly found water droplets during the gas measurement. If we acknowledged it was seeing water, it would violate the general rule. To figure out this problem, Jiang Changsheng, an old worker and Communist Party member, collected the water from the gas measurement and tasted it. He felt it was not the bottom water from the separator, but like groundwater. Later, water droplets were also found on the wax sheets. What exactly was going on? Everyone was very anxious.

    Analysis

    To solve this problem, I repeatedly thought about what "On Contradiction" said: "Each thing internally contains not only the particularity of contradiction, but also the universality of contradiction; universality exists within particularity." The general characteristics of oil wells seeing water are the universality of the contradiction, which is summarized from the particular manifestations of each water-seeing well. The abnormal phenomenon of our well number 21 is a particular manifestation. I told my idea to the master worker. I said, "An ordinary horse can only walk and carry things, but the People's Liberation Army's horse is different; it can also lie down and jump over obstacles according to human commands. It's very special. Why is it special? It's because they have these characteristics under strict training conditions, so they are different from ordinary horses, but they are still horses. The special nature of our oil well is also determined by its special essence." The master worker said, "That's right! Then how is our well special? You have to figure it out!" What exactly was the essential nature that defined and influenced the special phenomenon of well number 21? To figure out this problem, the well team held an analysis meeting, bringing out the entire history of this well. The master worker read the data, and the literate ones did the comparison and calculation, analyzing it bit by bit. After three days of exploration, we found the problem. Why did the casing pressure rise instead of decrease? I think it was related to hot oil dewaxing. At that time, the second row of wells implemented hot oil dewaxing, using casing gas to inject oil into the well. As soon as the casing gas was used up, it was immediately replenished from the gas well to well number 21 through the ground pipeline. This caused the casing pressure to be inaccurate and unable to reflect the underground situation truthfully. Therefore, the casing pressure was not a basis for comparison. This is like a swollen patient; a fat face is an illusion, not real fat. Why did the static pressure and flowing pressure decrease? After analysis, it was caused by changing to a larger nozzle. In June 1964, the nozzle of well number 21 was changed to a larger one, and the production increased. However, the water injection volume of the water well remained unchanged. Therefore, the consumption of oil reservoir energy in production was too large, so the flowing pressure and static pressure decreased. This is like a person working; if the workload increases, the physical consumption will be greater, and fatigue will come faster. Now that we have found the reasons for the decrease in several pressures, what is the problem with the increase in oil-gas ratio and the decrease in production? After investigation, we learned that the water well stopped injecting water on August 3. In this way, oil flowed out vigorously, and the oil reservoir had no energy to replenish it. The oil well relied on its own power to produce oil, and the formation capacity was consumed greatly. The oil and gas separated too early at the bottom of the well, and the gas ran out from the ground, leaving a large amount of dead oil in the oil reservoir. This affected the decrease in production and the increase in oil-gas ratio. This is like a runner in a race; the more he pants, the less energy he has, and the less distance he can run. The same is true for oil wells; if there is insufficient gas, how can the production not decrease?

    Through these analyses, we realized that these phenomena, which seemed abnormal in general oil wells, were normal for our well.

    Conclusion

    Although these problems have found theoretical basis, they still cannot convince people. Some people say, "Theory is theory after all. It's not truly seeing water until the laboratory test says it is." Chairman Mao said, "Only social practice is the criterion of truth for people's knowledge of the external world." Knowledge comes from practice. The theoretical knowledge obtained from practice must return to practice. Therefore, our entire well team worked together to collect the water droplets from the wellhead, the gas measurement water droplets, bit by bit, and also asked the well testing team to take samples from the bottom of the well for testing at the same time. After many tests and comparisons, the results were finally obtained on November 3, 1964: the ground test showed a water content of 0.03%, and the water sample taken from the bottom of the well showed a water content of 0.24%, proving that this well was indeed seeing water. This provided us with an accurate basis for taking measures to reduce the water content and increase production.

    从一般性中找特殊性

    疑问
    一九六四年十月，我们管的二排二十一井测气时发现了几滴水珠，老师傅说：“水珠向我们提出警告，油井见水了。”但谁也不相信这口井能见水，因为谁都知道油井见水有个普遍规律，这就是在见水前，油压、流压、静压，同时上升，产量增加，套压、油气比下降。可是我们井却偏偏出现了反常现象，静压、流压、油压不是上升，而是下降，套压和油气比不是下降，而是上升；产量不是增加，而是递减。这些现象，和一般油井见水前的现象恰恰相反，怎么会见水呢？不承认见水吧，测气时明明发现了水珠。承认见水吧，又违反了一般规律。为了弄清这个问题，老工人共产党员姜长生，把测气收集起来的水，用舌头去尝，他觉得不是分离器底水，而象地下水。后来到蜡片上也见了水珠，这到底是怎么一回事呢？大家都很着急。分　析
    为了解决这个问题，我反复想着《矛盾论》里所说的：“每一个事物内部不但包含了矛盾的特殊性，而且包含了矛盾的普遍性，普遍性即存在于特殊性之中”。油井见水的一般特征，是矛盾的普遍性，它是从每个见水井的特殊表现总结出来的。我们二十一井的反常现象，正是一种特殊的表现。我把我的想法向老师傅讲了，我说：“一般的马，它只能够走路，驮东西，而解放军的马就不一样，还能按人的指挥卧倒、跳越障碍，很特殊，为什么特殊呢？是由于它们在严格的训练条件之下，才具有的这种特点，所以它和一般的马就不一样，但它们仍然是马。我们的油井的特殊性质，也是由它的特殊本质所规定的。”老师傅说：“对呀！那咱这口井怎么特殊？你把它抓出来呀！”二十一井这种特殊现象究竟是什么本质规定和影响着它呢？为了弄清这个问题，井组召开了分析会，把这口井的全部历史搬出来，老师傅念数据，有文化的做对比和计算，进行一点一点的分析，经过三天时间的摸索，发现了问题所在。为什么套压上升，而不是下降呢？我认为这与热油清蜡有关。那时二排井实行热油清蜡，用套管气往井里压油，套管气一消耗，马上通过地面管线，就从气井给二十一井补气，这样就造成套压不准，不能如实反映地下情况。所以，套压不是对比的依据。这就象浮肿病人一样，脸胖是一种假象，不是真胖。静压、流压为什么降低呢？经过分析，它是换大油嘴造成的。一九六四年六月份，二十一井油嘴换大，产量增加了，可是水井的注水量，仍保持不变，因此生产中消耗油层能量太大，所以流压、静压下降。这就象一个人劳动一样，工作量增加了，体力消耗就要大，疲乏的也就快。关于几个压力下降的原因找到了，那么油气比升高，产量降低，又是什么问题呢？经过调查才知道，原来在八月三日，水井就停止注水了，这样，油呼呼往外流，油层没有能量来补充，油井靠本身力量出油，地层能力消耗大，油气过早在井底分离，气从地下跑出来，大量死油留在油层，所以影响到产量下降，油气比上升。这就象运动员赛跑一样，气喘的越厉害，越没劲，越跑不远，油井也一样，气不足了，产量怎么能不下降呢？
    通过这些分析，我们才认识到，这些在一般油井看来是反常现象，对我们这口井来说，却是正常现象。结　论
    这些问题虽然从理论上找到了依据，但是还不能使人信服，有人说：“理论终归是理论，化验说是见水了，那才算真见水。”毛主席说：“只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准”。认识是从实践中来的。实践得到的理论认识，必须回到实践中去。所以，我们全井组一起动手，把井口的水珠，测气水珠，一点一滴的收起来，又要求试井队进行井底取样，同时化验。经过多次化验、对比，终于在一九六四年十一月三日得到结果，地面化验含水百分之零点零三，井底见水取样含水百分之零点二四，证明这口井确实见水了，这就为我们采取措施，降低含水量，增加产量找到了确切的根据。
