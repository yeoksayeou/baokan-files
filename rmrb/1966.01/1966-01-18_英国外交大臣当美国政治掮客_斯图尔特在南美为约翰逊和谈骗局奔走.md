    British Foreign Secretary Acts as American Political Broker
    Stewart Travels in South America to Promote Johnson's "Peace Talks" Deception
    Xinhua News Agency, January 16th:  British Foreign Secretary Stewart recently, during his visit to three South American countries, acted as a broker for the Johnson administration's "peace talks" deception, providing cover for the US's scheme to expand its aggression in Vietnam.

    Reportedly, when Stewart transited through New York on the 1st en route to South America, he told reporters at the airport that "if Britain can be of any help in President Johnson's current efforts, we will be very happy to help in this regard."

    In press conferences held during his visit, Stewart repeatedly touted the "peace talks" deception by which the United States seeks to remain in South Vietnam indefinitely as "one of the most important and lasting movements towards peace," and the US's war blackmail of a so-called "halt to bombing" of North Vietnam as a "effort very helpful to secure negotiations."  He even openly threatened at a press conference in Santiago, Chile, that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "will bear a very serious responsibility if it refuses these conditions." Stewart said at a press conference in Lima, Peru: "The United States' efforts to shift the Vietnam crisis from the battlefield to the negotiating table continue to receive British support."

    An Associated Press dispatch pointed out that Britain's service to the United States' "peace" deception was "agreed upon by President Johnson and Prime Minister Wilson during their meeting in Washington last month," with the plan being for Britain to join in later as a "broker" to "bring the conflict to the negotiating table."

    From January 1st to 14th, Stewart visited Peru, Chile, and Argentina in South America to find ways to strengthen Britain's economic position in Latin America.

    英国外交大臣当美国政治掮客
    斯图尔特在南美为约翰逊和谈骗局奔走
    新华社十六日讯　英国外交大臣斯图尔特最近在访问南美三国的时候，充当约翰逊政府“和谈”骗局的掮客，为美国扩大侵略越南的阴谋打掩护。
    据报道，斯图尔特一日途经纽约前往南美的时候，在机场上对记者说，“如果英国能够在约翰逊总统目前的努力中有所帮助的话，我们将非常乐于在这方面进行帮助。”
    斯图尔特在访问中举行的记者招待会上一再吹嘘美国为了长期赖在南越不走的“和谈”骗局是什么“走向和平的最重要和最持久的运动之一”，美国对越南北方所谓“暂停轰炸”的战争讹诈又是什么“十分有助于争取举行谈判会议的努力”。他在智利圣地亚哥举行的记者招待会上还露骨地威胁说，越南民主共和国“如果拒绝（美国的）这些条件，将要负非常严重的责任”。斯图尔特在秘鲁利马举行的记者招待会上说：“美国为了使越南危机从战场上转移到会议桌上来而作的努力继续得到英国的支持”。
    美联社的一条消息中指出，英国为美国的“和平”骗局效劳是“约翰逊总统和威尔逊首相上个月在华盛顿会谈时一致同意的”，计划是让英国以后参加进来，作为“经纪人”，“把冲突拿到会议桌上来谈”。
    斯图尔特从一月一日到十四日访问了南美的秘鲁、智利和阿根廷，为加强英国在拉丁美洲的经济地位寻找门路。
