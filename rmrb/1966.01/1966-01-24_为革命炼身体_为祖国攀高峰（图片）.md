    Train the Body for the Revolution, Scale the Heights for the Motherland
    Under the brilliant illumination of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, China’s sports undertaking is flourishing, exhibiting an unprecedented scene of prosperity.
    Mass sports activities are magnificent and full of vigor. The broad masses of the people are exercising for the revolution, enduring the tests of wind and waves and dangers on the great rivers and seas, and in the mountains and ridges. Everywhere, you can hear the slogan "Exercise to build the motherland, defend the motherland," and see groups of people persisting in exercise. Through sports activities, people are training their bodies, training their will, and training their skills.
    Our athletes, taking the table tennis team as an example, have established the idea of "playing for the revolution," putting the honor of the motherland first, and scaling the peaks of world sports technology. National records are being broken in batches; good news of reaching world-class levels continues to pour in; and the names of Chinese athletes are being written in the list of world champions and records, one after another.
    Our athletes and the vast number of sports enthusiasts firmly remember Chairman Mao’s teachings about continuous revolution, are full of revolutionary pride and ambition, and continue to forge ahead bravely.
    Recently, "Sports News" and "New Sports" conducted a selection of outstanding sports photography works from 1964-1965. The photos published here are selected from the excellent works of this selection.

    为革命炼身体  为祖国攀高峰
    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的光辉照耀下，我国体育事业蓬勃发展，出现了前所未有的繁荣景象。
    群众性体育活动，波澜壮阔，生气勃勃。广大人民群众为革命而锻炼身体，在大江大海中，在丛山峻岭上，经受风浪和艰险的考验。到处可以听到“锻炼身体，建设祖国，保卫祖国”的口号，看到坚持锻炼的人群。人们通过体育活动，炼身体，炼意志，炼本领。
    我国运动员以乒乓球队为榜样，树立“为革命而打球”的思想，把祖国荣誉放在第一位，攀登世界运动技术高峰。全国纪录，成批成批地刷新；达到世界水平的喜讯，不断传来；在世界冠军和纪录的名册里，写下了一个又一个中国运动员的姓名。
    我国的运动员、广大体育活动爱好者牢牢记住毛主席关于不断革命的教导，满怀革命的豪情壮志，继续勇往直前。
    最近《体育报》、《新体育》进行了一九六四——一九六五年优秀体育运动摄影作品评选，这里刊登的照片选自这次评选优秀的作品。
