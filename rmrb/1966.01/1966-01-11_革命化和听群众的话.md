Listening to the masses or not seems to be a matter of work style, but in essence, it is a matter of standpoint and viewpoint, reflecting whether our county committee's relationship with the masses is properly positioned: Is it the masses first, or are we first? Is it believing in the masses, or only believing in ourselves? Is it placing ourselves among the masses, or above the masses? Is it serving the masses, or wanting the masses to serve us? If these fundamental viewpoints are not resolved, it will be impossible to hear the true voice of the masses, and it will be impossible to achieve the revolutionization of the county committee leadership.

How can we truly listen to the masses? I have the following experiences:

First, it is to listen sincerely, not formalistically. Listening to the masses, letting the masses speak their minds, lies in sincerity. If we treat the masses with sincerity, the masses will treat us with sincerity. "Exchange hearts and hearts stick together," this saying is indeed reasonable. Last spring, when we promoted the experience of returning straw to the fields, the masses supported it, but had opinions about returning all the straw to the fields. We didn't know this situation beforehand, and we had consulted some of the masses before the promotion, but we asked the masses with preconceived notions and lacked sincerity. At that time, the masses' attitude was not very clear, so we mistakenly thought that the masses had no objections. As a result, later on, a few areas lacked cooking grass and needed to expand the supply of coal; our emphasis on stubble eradication also affected the progress of other farm work, especially in some paddy fields where too much wheat straw was buried, which made it difficult to transplant small seedlings well. These things fully illustrate that the key to listening to the masses lies in sincerity. Why are we sometimes among the masses, but our hearts are outside the masses? The fundamental problem lies in the lack of a "sincerity," the lack of a sincere heart to serve the people wholeheartedly.

Second, it is to listen in order to solve problems, not to listen for the sake of listening. So-called sincerity means sincerely letting the people be the masters of their own affairs and doing things according to the requirements and opinions of the masses. That is to say, the purpose of our listening to the masses is to effectively solve various problems in our work, not to listen for the sake of listening. Only by solving problems can we hear more opinions; hearing more opinions, in turn, will prompt us to solve more problems. Large-scale green manure planting and large-scale pig raising in our county were initiated by listening to the opinions of the masses. We here lacked fertilizer. After discussion among the masses, green manure was planted. Planting green manure then led to the problem of competing for land. Relying on the masses, intercropping and crop rotation methods were devised to resolve the contradiction. Then, we solicited the opinions of the masses and focused on pig raising. Now, more than 80% of the autumn-harvested crops in our county have green manure as a base fertilizer, and the number of pigs has increased to more than 350,000, of which more than 160,000 are raised collectively. This is the result of our listening to the opinions of the masses and implementing them seriously. Old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions will arise. We must constantly listen to the opinions of the masses and constantly solve problems according to the opinions of the masses. In the process of listening to opinions and solving problems, we will advance our cause.

Third, the words of the superiors must be listened to, and the words of the masses must also be listened to. Whether listening to the masses is sincere or not is also reflected in the relationship between listening to the words of the superiors and listening to the words of the masses. Every revolutionary work is carried out under the leadership of the Party and must strictly implement the Party's policies. Every revolutionary work is also specifically serving the people and must rely on the masses to complete it. Therefore, listening to the words of the superiors and listening to the words of the masses are consistent. Only by carefully listening to the words of the masses can we more correctly understand and implement the words of the superiors. Last spring, based on the situation in the county, we proposed a general time for sowing spring corn to the communes. Several communes, because the fresh grass yield of green manure used as base fertilizer was not high, after discussion among the masses, appropriately delayed the sowing time of spring corn without delaying the farming season, and the result was very good. The example shows that only by truly listening to the words of the masses can we truly listen to the words of the superiors, because the words of the superiors come from the masses and are also put forward for the benefit of the people.

Fourth, positive words must be listened to, and negative words must also be listened to. Another important criterion for whether treating the words of the masses is sincere or not is: Do you listen to words that do not conform to your own wishes? Do you listen to words that oppose you? We have realized that some "negative words" often contain the truth or point out problems that we have not noticed for a long time. Even if it is wrong, listening to it will help to comprehensively grasp the situation and make the work more targeted. I also have this experience: Whether the masses are speaking negatively can only be known after they speak out. If we don't listen to negative words at all, we will block the channels of speech and even positive words will not be heard. One year, when we were promoting reasonable close planting of cotton, some people said sarcastically, "So dense, don't worry about burning the grass this year." These words can be said to be negative, but they are very enlightening: First, it shows that some people's thinking is not clear, and it is necessary to strengthen ideological work; second, it raises our vigilance, and the tendency to become denser and better is corrected as soon as it occurs. Therefore, positive words can certainly promote our progress, while listening to negative words can promote us to improve our work and prevent mistakes. Even completely wrong words are helpful for us to think about problems.

To listen to the masses, we must first go to the masses.

    革命化和听群众的话
    在领导工作中如何及时地正确地反映人民群众的革命要求，如何听群众的话，如何把上级的话和群众的话融合在一起，如何对待反面的话（特别是反对自己的话），为什么听了群众的话之后重在执行等等，这篇文章作了生动、辩证的阐述。
    ——编者
    听不听群众的话，看来是工作作风问题，但实质上是立场观点问题，反映着我们县委领导和群众的关系有没有摆正：是群众第一，还是我们第一；是相信群众，还是只相信自己；是把自己放在群众之中，还是放在群众之上；是为群众服务，还是要群众为自己服务。这些根本观点不解决，就无法听到群众真正的声音，也就无法实现县委领导的革命化。
    怎么样使我们真正听群众的话呢？我有这样的体会：
    一、是真心诚意地听，不是形式主义地听。听群众的话，让群众说出心里的话，在于心诚。我们对群众以诚相待。群众对我们也就以诚对诚。“将心换心心贴心”，此话确是有理。去年春天，我们推广秸草还田经验，群众对这是拥护的，但对全部秸草还田有意见，这情况我们事前并不知道，推广前也曾向部分群众征询过意见，但我们带了框框问群众，缺乏诚意，当时群众态度不太明朗，就误以为群众没有意见。果然后来少数地区群众炊草不足，需要扩大煤的供应量；我们强调亩亩灭茬，也影响了其他农活的进度，特别是有些水稻田埋的麦秸太多，反而小秧栽得不好。这些事充分说明要听群众的话，关键在于诚。为什么我们有时人在群众之中，心却在群众之外呢？根本问题在于缺少一个“诚”字，缺少一个全心全意为人民服务的诚心。
    二、是为了解决问题而听，不是为听而听。所谓真心诚意，就是真心诚意地让人民群众当家作主，按照群众的要求和意见办事。也就是说我们听群众话的目的，在于切实解决我们工作上的各种问题，不是为听而听。只有解决了问题，我们才能听到更多意见；听到了更多意见，又反过来促使我们解决更多的问题。我县大种绿肥和大量养猪就是听群众意见搞起来的。我们这里肥料不足，经过群众讨论，种了绿肥。种了绿肥又发生了争地问题，依靠群众想出了间作、套作的办法，解决了矛盾。接着我们又征询群众意见，抓了养猪这一条。现在我县秋熟作物有百分之八十以上有绿肥做基肥，猪发展到三十五万多头，其中集体饲养的有十六万多头。这是我们听取群众意见认真执行的结果。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会发生，我们必须不断地听取群众的意见，不断地按群众的意见解决问题。就在听取意见，解决问题的过程中，把我们的事业推向前进。
    三、上级的话要听，群众的话也要听。听群众的话是否真心诚意，还表现在听上级的话和听群众话的关系问题上。每一项革命工作，都是在党的领导下进行的，都必须严格执行党的方针政策。每一项革命工作又是具体地为人民服务的，必须依靠群众来完成。因此，听上级的话和听群众的话是一致的。只有认真地倾听群众的话，才能更正确地理解和贯彻执行上级的话。去年春天，我们根据全县情况，对各公社提出了播种春玉米的大体时间，有几个公社由于做基肥的绿肥鲜草产量不高，经过群众讨论，在不误农时的情况下，适当的推迟了春玉米的播种时间，结果情况很好。事例说明只有真正听了群众的话，才是真正听了上级的话，因为上级的话是从群众中来的，也是为了人民群众的利益而提出来的。
    四、正面的话要听，反面的话也要听。对待群众的话是否真心诚意，还有一个重要的标准是：不符合自己心意的话听不听？反对自己的话听不听？我们体会到：有一些“反面话”常常包含着真理，或者指出了自己长期未觉察的问题。就是错误的话，听了也便于全面地掌握情况，使工作更有针对性。我还有这样的体会：群众讲的是不是反面的话，只有讲出来才知道，如果我们根本不听反面的话，就会阻塞言路，连正面的话也不会听到。有一年我们在推广棉花合理密植，有些群众冷言冷语地说：“这样密，今年不用愁草烧了。”这样的话，可以说是反面话，但很有启发：第一，说明有些群众思想不通，有加强思想工作的必要；第二，提高了我们的警惕性，一发生越密越好的偏向就得到纠正。所以说，正面的话固然可促使我们前进，听反面的话则可以促使我们改进工作，防止发生错误，就是完全错误的话，听了也有利于我们思考问题。
    要听群众话，首先要到群众中去。
