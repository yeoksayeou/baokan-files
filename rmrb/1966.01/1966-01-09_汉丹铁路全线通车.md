    Handan Railway Fully Opens to Traffic
    This railway runs from Wuhan to Danjiangkou in Jun County, is 420 kilometers long. After opening, it will better promote the development of industrial and agricultural production in the regions along the line.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th—The Handan Railway was fully opened to traffic on the 1st of this month.
    This railway, from Wuhan to Danjiangkou in Jun County, runs through the hilly areas of northwestern Hubei, passing through the six counties of Yunmeng, Anlu, Sui County, Zaoyang, Xiangyang, and Guanghua. After the railway opens to traffic, it will better promote the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction in these regions. In the past, the agricultural and sideline products and local specialties produced in these counties, as well as the agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, building materials, and daily-use industrial products needed locally, were all transported in and out via the Han River waterway and highways, resulting in high transportation costs and long transportation times. After the railway opens to traffic, the contradiction between the large volume of goods to be transported and the insufficient transportation capacity can be greatly alleviated.
    This railway is 420 kilometers long and was gradually built from 1958 onwards, using the method of phased construction and opening to traffic while building.
    The Handan Railway is the product of a vigorous mass movement under the leadership of the central authorities in charge and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. During the construction process, the combination of state support and the development of local initiative, and the combination of reliance on professional teams and reliance on the broad masses, were emphasized, implementing the policy of "people's railway built by the people," which greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of various local departments and the broad masses.
    In the process of road construction, the construction departments also implemented four combinations: combining migrant worker road construction with not delaying agricultural work, combining railway construction with farmland water conservancy construction, combining soil excavation for projects with land leveling, and combining the construction of railway bridges, culverts, and road protection with the construction of rural roads. These practices were very beneficial to the development of agricultural production along the route and the improvement of rural transportation conditions, and were therefore welcomed by the masses along the route.

    汉丹铁路全线通车
    这条铁路从武汉到均县丹江口，长四百二十公里，通车后，将更好地促进沿线地区工农业生产的发展
    新华社武汉八日电　汉丹铁路已在本月一日全线通车。
    这条从武汉到均县丹江口的铁路，贯通鄂西北丘陵地区的云梦、安陆、随县、枣阳、襄阳、光化六县。铁路通车之后，将更好地促进这些地区工农业生产建设的发展。过去，这些县盛产的农副产品和土特产品，以及当地需要的农业机械、化肥、农药、建筑材料和日用工业品，都靠汉江水道和公路运出运进，运费高，运时长；铁路通车后，运量大同运力不足之间的矛盾，可以大大缓和下来。
    这条铁路长四百二十公里，是从一九五八年起，采用分期分批和边建边通车的办法陆续建成的。
    汉丹铁路是在中央主管部门和中共湖北省委的领导下，大搞群众运动的产物。在施工过程中，既把国家的扶持同发挥地方积极性结合了起来，又把依靠专业队伍同依靠广大群众结合了起来，贯彻了“人民铁路人民办”的方针，很好地调动了地方各部门和广大群众的积极性。
    施工部门在筑路过程中，还实行了四个结合：民工修路与不误农时相结合，兴修铁路与农田水利建设相结合，工程取土与平整土地相结合，修铁路桥涵护道与修农村道路相结合。这样做的结果，对发展沿线农业生产和改善农村交通状况都有很大的好处，因而受到了沿线群众的欢迎。
