    Can the Potential for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy Be Continuously Tapped?

    The Shanghai working class's answer is: as long as we highlight politics, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, promote the ideological revolutionization of people, give play to people's creativity, constantly innovate technology, change conditions, and create conditions, we can continuously tap potential.

    "Add a bit of effort, add a measure, add a condition, and new potential will emerge." During our visit to Shanghai before the Spring Festival, we often heard this kind of talk expressing boundless confidence in this year's increase in production and practicing economy, from leading organs to grassroots enterprises.

    Shanghai, this largest industrial city in our country, is experiencing a sustained and healthy new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy. "Flowers are flying everywhere in the spring city." No matter where you go, people are talking about the situation, discussing tasks, learning from Daqing, and finding shortcomings. People enthusiastically tell you that they see not only the present but also the future; they see not only China but also the world. They have determined to take a big step forward this year and make the greatest and best contributions to the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    Scaling Higher Peaks from a Higher Level

    This year, the state has given Shanghai a larger production task than last year. Shanghai must also vigorously support industrial and agricultural construction throughout the country. Since 1958, the Shanghai working class, which has always been full of vigor, will concentrate its efforts this year to fight some annihilation battles and strive for a new leap forward on the road to catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced scientific and technological levels. All these tasks are starting from a higher level.

    In 1965, Shanghai's industrial production increased by more than 20%, which was the highest growth rate in recent years, with many products increasing by half to one time. In this year, the quality of industrial products reached the highest level in history, with first- and second-class products accounting for more than 98% of all products, of which first-class products accounted for 70%. This year was also a year of great increase in variety, with tens of thousands of technically advanced new products successfully trial-produced. All these outstanding achievements were obtained under the conditions of reducing personnel, lowering costs, and not engaging in large-scale capital construction. That is to say, they were all achieved by tapping potential. 1965 was a year in which Shanghai's industrial labor productivity greatly improved, and a year in which production potential was greatly brought into play.

    When climbing peaks, the progress is generally faster at the beginning. Once you have climbed relatively high, it is not so easy to climb higher. In 1965, so much potential had already been tapped, can more be tapped in 1966?

    "Yes, we have the conditions. In the past few years of difficulties, we held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the great red banner of the General Line, fought against difficulties, and achieved one victory after another. Now that the conditions are so good, the increase in production and practicing economy in 1966 will definitely achieve greater gains."

    Why do the comrades in Shanghai have such great confidence? The fundamental reason is that the spiritual outlook of the Shanghai working class is getting better and better. The widespread and in-depth development of the socialist education movement, the deep rooting of Mao Zedong Thought in people's hearts, and the revolution under thatched sheds, which has become a fashion of self-reliance and hard struggle, are the fundamental guarantees for continuously tapping potential and achieving one victory after another.

    Mao Zedong Thought Takes Root in People's Hearts

    Qi Zhichao, a young man from an industrial research institute in Shanghai, and seven other young people took on the task of trial-producing a new product. They experimented in a small attic for more than a month and failed. They re-studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" (namely, "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Serve the People," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune"), and understood that to do revolution, one must be "completely" and "thoroughly."

    The "Three Constantly Read Articles" strengthened their fighting spirit, and they continued to experiment. They went to the street and bought a picture of Chairman Mao from the Xinhua Bookstore, and posted it on the wall of the laboratory. The eight people resolutely stated: We must succeed in the experiment!

    One hurdle after another. The second difficult hurdle had been tested five hundred times, but it still hadn't been overcome. Everyone stopped the experiment again, sat down, and once again sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works. They thought: The Daqing workers started their careers with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," we should also rely on "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to trial-produce this new product.

    When they read Chairman Mao's teaching in "On Practice": "After failures, people also learn lessons from failures, correct their thinking to adapt it to the laws of the outside world, and people can turn failures into victories..." At this time, they realized that climbing the peak of science and technology not only requires a revolutionary spirit that is not afraid of hardships, but also a strict scientific attitude, and that they must constantly summarize the experiences and lessons of each failure in order to turn failure into victory. At the same time, they learned from "On Contradiction" that they must concentrate their efforts to overcome the main contradictions that lead to failure.

    The great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave these eight young people infinite strength and wisdom. After one thousand and five experiments, they finally broke through the difficult hurdle and finally got the new product.

    We came to the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, which is famous for producing special-shaped steel tubes. This small factory with more than three hundred people, which looks very dilapidated, is now bustling with people and famous throughout the country. Orders for various special-shaped seamless steel tubes that are used in small quantities but are very important are pouring in.

    In a small office where you could touch the ceiling by raising your hand, we found Comrade Zhao Xixiang, the party branch secretary. He told us that, in terms of quantity, the existing orders for special-shaped steel tubes have increased by nearly double compared with last year. This is not the main thing. The problem lies in being particularly special, particularly large, particularly thick, particularly small, particularly thin, and requiring particularly high precision. In a word, there are more new varieties and stricter quality requirements. However, the existing equipment and technology cannot solve these problems.

    There are indeed many difficulties. What to do? The leadership announced all the new product trial production requirements and worked with the masses to find solutions. The workers discussed and concluded that they should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be brave in shouldering heavy burdens, and undertake all the tasks. They said, "Whether or not to take on this burden is a major issue of whether or not to continue the revolution and continue to move forward!"

    The workers of this factory linked the production of more new varieties of special-shaped seamless steel tubes to the great revolution, and immediately generated infinite power. The list of new products announced for 1966 was quickly shared by the workers of the three shifts, while the new product group of this factory had very little work to do.

    Pointing Out the Main Attack Direction to the Masses

    "Point where to hit, and hit where pointed." This is the combat tradition of the People's Liberation Army. Today, under the leadership of the Party, the working class of our country has also inherited this tradition, and their revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm are unprecedentedly high. What we should pay attention to now is to guide this revolutionary enthusiasm to the correct path and point out to the masses where the main attack direction is. This is extremely important.

    If the direction is unclear and the method is wrong, the expected effect will not be achieved, and the enthusiasm of the masses may even be damaged. According to their experience over the past few years, the comrades in Shanghai believe that the enthusiasm of the masses must be guided to technological innovation and technological revolution, so that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy will be tapped more and more, and will never be exhausted. Their specific methods are to organize the power of the masses and march toward "Five News" - new design, new materials, new technology, new crafts, new equipment.

    What is the effect of developing "Five News?" A crane transportation machinery factory in Shanghai recently carried out a product design revolution on a double-beam bridge crane and adopted a new design, resulting in a saving of one-third of raw materials. This also created an important condition for increasing production - the raw materials relatively increased.

    A refrigeration machinery factory in Shanghai produces a type of air cooler called P11. The original volume of each unit was 10.8 cubic meters, but now it is only 1.8 cubic meters after adopting a new design. The volume is reduced by five-sixths, greatly saving raw materials, while the cooling capacity is increased.

    There is a Taishan Chemical Factory in Shanghai. The saccharin workshop of this factory has greatly shortened the production process due to continuous implementation of process reforms. In the first half of last year, it saved a building of more than 600 square meters and more than 100 pieces of equipment. By the end of last year, it had saved another floor and seven pieces of equipment. Other workshops also learned from the saccharin workshop, and more and more factory buildings were vacated, creating conditions for increasing the production of new products.

    All products require raw materials. In technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously grasping new types of steel, new types of chemical raw materials, and other new materials is an important link in continuously promoting the increase in production and practicing economy. "If we do not highlight the new type of raw materials, it will be difficult to climb the peak." The comrades in Shanghai not only see the near future but also see the distant future. They have listed the trial production and production of new materials as the focus of this year's movement to increase production and practice economy and catch up with the world's advanced level, which is of great significance.

    Increasing production depends on "Five News," and saving also depends on "Five News." The Shanghai Alcohol Factory is an advanced unit in the country for saving coal. In the past few years, one ton of coal was used to produce one ton of alcohol. Last year, it has been reduced to about 600 kilograms. This year, the entire factory has proposed a new goal: "Two tons of alcohol, one ton of coal!" That is to say, reduce the coal consumption per ton of alcohol produced to 500 kilograms. Why can this factory save coal in such a large amount? It is because they have adopted a series of new technologies in the process flow.

    Comprehensive utilization is the most effective method for saving resources, but to implement comprehensive utilization of coal, petroleum, wood, etc., it is also necessary to adopt appropriate new technologies and new processes.

    The rapid increase in production capacity based on new technologies has powerfully promoted the continuous improvement of product quality. Adopting new technologies and using large-scale collaboration methods to organize production has a very good effect on seeking more in quality, seeking fast in quality, and seeking savings in quality. These have been proven by Shanghai in practice.

    Thatch Sheds and Modernization

    Adopting "Five News" means producing good, more, and economical products with the least manpower, material resources, and financial resources. But who should be relied on to create these "Five News?" Is it mainly relying on the higher authorities to allocate new equipment and new materials, or is it mainly relying on a few cadres and technicians? Shanghai's experience is that neither of these is the case. Instead, it mainly relies on the masses and relies on the revolution under the thatch sheds.

    Recently, various industrial enterprises in Shanghai are setting off a wave of learning from the Weihai Iron Factory. This Weihai Factory, located in Yangshupu with more than 200 people, was originally a "big blacksmith shop" actually merged from twelve small blacksmith shops. A large part of the factory buildings are built with thatch sheds. In addition to two belt drilling machines, one punch press, and twenty or so iron hammers, they have no other decent "weapons." But they have the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. These revolutionary blacksmiths, under the thatch sheds, used their own hands to create many highly efficient mechanized special equipment, thus creating the first-class steel plate springs in the country.

    Under certain conditions, thatch sheds and modernization are not contradictory. The revolutionary spirit of the working class promotes the modernization of industry.

    When we visited this factory, we saw that they were building new factory buildings themselves. The thatch sheds are about to give way to modern buildings, but the spirit of making revolution under the thatch sheds still exists. They are not satisfied with the first-class products in the country and are striving to advance towards the goal of the best steel plate springs in the world!

    The Creativity of the Masses is Infinite, Technological Innovation is Endless

    "How much potential is there? We ourselves were not clear before the masses were mobilized." This is also a sentence we often heard during our visit to Shanghai. Once the masses are mobilized, people will see that the creativity of the masses is indeed endless, and technological innovation and technological revolution are indeed endless.

    The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is a modern large factory. It produces a high-grade, precision thread grinding machine. In order to meet the wider needs of China's industrial development, this factory decided to produce a simplified structure, light, small, and cheap, but precise thread grinding machine. However, there was neither experience nor ready-made data for producing this new grinding machine. What to do? Still the old method: find the masses. More than 20 amateur design researchers hired from veteran workers came up with many good ideas. As a result, the design task was completed in only four months. The parts were reduced from 1,500 to 500, but high precision was guaranteed.

    When we went to this factory, the drawings had already come out, and preparations were being actively made for small-scale production of this grinding machine, which will meet users in May.

    "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous..." Many facts we saw in Shanghai repeatedly prove that Chairman Mao Zedong's teaching is an eternal truth.

    When the masses are mobilized, the potential is like a gushing spring. In Shanghai, we saw a real mass movement of technological innovation.

    An Important Strategic Direction

    In the new high tide of the movement to increase production and practice economy in Shanghai, we also had a prominent feeling, that is, to take catching up with the internationally advanced level of science and technology as a very important part of the movement to increase production and practice economy. They said that only by striving to develop new technologies, catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level, can we further improve product quality and develop new products, better support the construction of various parts of the country, and better complete the various tasks assigned by the state. They said: This is an important strategic direction.

    The comrades in Shanghai firmly remembered Chairman Mao Zedong's words: "The Chinese people have the ambition and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." This is actually a struggle with imperialism and modern revisionism. Shanghai has an important responsibility in this struggle.

    The comrades in Shanghai also said that to carry out this struggle, we must have a clear concept of class struggle and must have an overwhelming revolutionary spirit. This is politics. Under this command of politics, they are focusing on and purposefully engaging in the research, experimentation, and application of many latest technologies. At the same time, all walks of life and all units have their own catching-up goals.

    Pay Attention to Acting According to Objective Laws

    The enthusiasm of the masses is getting greater and greater, and the methods for increasing production and practicing economy are getting more and more, so we must pay more attention to acting according to objective laws. The comrades in Shanghai said: As technological innovation and technological revolution are increasingly developed, and the adoption of "Five News" is increasingly widespread, it is even more necessary to emphasize a strict scientific attitude and emphasize that everything should be tested. Over the past few years, they have followed a principle: any major measure that is immature, unreliable, and uncertain should not be easily promoted on a large scale in production.

    The Shanghai textile industry has successfully tested many new technologies and new processes in the past few years, many of which are revolutionary changes, but they have not rushed to fully promote them all at once. Instead, they first chose a factory as a model and then gradually promoted it. They believe that this way the pace will not be chaotic, and they can truly run fast without going back.

    If we do not first highlight politics and only take the movement to increase production and practice economy as an economic movement, a production movement, or only focus on technology, and only a few people tap potential, then the potential is indeed limited. If we first put Mao Zedong Thought in command, put politics in the first place, lead the movement to increase production and practice economy as a political movement, grasp revolution, promote production, grasp revolutionization, promote modernization, implement ideological and political work in technological innovation and technological revolution, and give full play to people's creativity, and ask for potential from "Five News," then the potential will be tapped more and more. This is the deepest experience we felt during our visit to Shanghai.

### 增产节约的潜力能不断挖掘吗？

专栏：

    增产节约的潜力能不断挖掘吗？
    上海工人阶级的答复是：只要突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装起来，促进人的思想革命化，发挥人的创造力，不断革新技术，改变条件，创造条件，就能不断地挖出潜力。
    “添一分干劲，加一个措施，多一个条件，新的潜力就又出来了。”春节前夕，我们在上海访问的过程中，从领导机关到基层企业，常常听到这种对今年的增产节约具有无限信心的话语。
    上海，这个我国最大的工业城市，增产节约的新高潮在持续地健康地发展中。“春城无处不飞花”，不论走到那里，人们都在谈形势，议任务，学大庆，找差距。人们热情地告诉你，他们不仅看到眼前，而且看到未来；不仅看到中国，而且看到世界。他们已下定决心，今年要大大前进一步，为第三个五年计划的第一年，作出最大最好的贡献。
    从较高水平攀更高山峰
    今年，国家给上海的生产任务比去年大。上海还要大力支援全国各地工农业建设。从一九五八年以来，一直意气风发的上海工人阶级，今年还要集中力量，打好些歼灭战，在赶超世界先进的科学技术水平的道路上，力争有一个新的跃进。而所有这些任务，都是从一个较高水平出发的。
    一九六五年，上海的工业生产，增长了百分之二十以上，是最近几年中增长比例最高的一年，许多产品，增长半倍到一倍。这一年，工业产品的质量达到了历年来的最高水平，一、二类产品，占全部产品的百分之九十八以上，其中一类产品占百分之七十。这一年，也是品种大大增加的一年，试制成功了上万种技术上比较先进的新产品。所有这些突出的成就，都是在减少人员、降低成本、不搞大的基本建设的条件下取得的。这就是说，都是靠挖潜力取得的。一九六五年，是上海工业的劳动生产率大大提高的一年，是生产潜力大大发挥的一年。
    攀登高峰，开始时，进度一般是比较快的，已经爬得比较高了，再往上爬，就不那么容易了。一九六五年，已经挖了那样多的潜力，一九六六年还能再挖吗？
    “能，我们有条件。在前几年困难的时候，我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高举总路线的伟大红旗，同困难作斗争，取得了一个又一个胜利，现在条件这样好，一九六六年的增产节约，肯定会取得更大的收获。”
    上海的同志们，为什么有这样大的信心呢？根本的原因是，上海的工人阶级的精神面貌越来越好。社会主义教育运动广泛深入的发展，毛泽东思想的深入人心，芦席棚下闹革命，成为自力更生、艰苦奋斗的风尚，这些就是能不断挖掘潜力，取得一个又一个胜利的根本保证。
    毛泽东思想深入人心
    上海一个工业研究所的青年祁志超，和另外七个青年人一起，担负了一项新产品试制的任务。在小阁楼上试验了一个多月，失败了。他们重新学习了毛主席的“老三篇”（即《愚公移山》《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》），懂得了干革命要“完全”，要“彻底”。
  “老三篇”坚定了他们的斗志，继续试验下去。他们走到街上，到新华书店买了一张毛主席的象，回去贴在实验室的墙上，八个人坚决表示：一定要试验成功！
    过了一关又一关。第二道难关已经试验了五百次，仍然没有攻破。大家又停止了试验，坐下来，又一次向毛主席著作讨教。他们想：大庆工人是靠“两论”起家的，我们也应当靠“两论”试制这个新产品。
    当他们读到毛主席在《实践论》中的教导：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利……”这时，他们才明白：攀登科学技术高峰，不仅要有不怕艰险的革命精神，而且要有严格的科学态度，要不断总结每次失败的经验教训，才能变失败为胜利。同时，他们又从《矛盾论》中学到：要集中力量攻破导致失败的主要矛盾。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给了这八个青年人无限力量和智慧。在经过了一千零五次的试验后，他们终于突破难关，最后把新产品拿到手了。
    我们来到了以生产异型钢管著名的永鑫无缝钢管厂。这个三百来人的，看起来很破旧的小厂，现在人来人往，扬名全国，各种用量很少但是很重要的异型无缝钢管的订单，纷沓而至。
    在一间举手可触及天棚的矮小的办公室中，我们找到了党支部书记赵熙祥同志，他告诉我们：从数量上说，现有的异型钢管的订货，已经比去年增加近一倍。这还不是主要的，问题在于特异、特大、特厚、特小、特薄，精确度要求特高。一句话，新品种更多，质量要求更严。可是，现有的设备和技术解决不了这些问题。
    困难确实不少，怎么办？领导上把全部新产品的试制要求公布出去，和群众一起想办法。工人们讨论的结果是，要按毛主席的指示办事，勇于挑重担子，把所有的任务都承担下来。他们说：“挑不挑这个担子，是一个要不要继续革命，继续前进的大问题！”
    这个厂的工人，把生产更多新品种的异型无缝钢管，同伟大的革命联系起来，就立刻产生了无穷的力量。公布的一九六六年新产品名单，绝大部分很快都被三个班的工人分担了，而这个厂的新产品小组却反而没有多少活好干了。
    向群众指明主攻方向
    “指到那里，打到那里”，这是人民解放军的战斗传统。如今我国的工人阶级在党的领导下，也继承了这个传统，革命积极性和生产积极性空前高涨。现在要我们注意的是，把这种革命干劲引到正确的路上去，向群众指明主攻的方向在那里。这是极其重要的。
    方向不明，方法不对，就达不到预期的效果，甚至损伤群众的积极性。上海的同志们，根据几年来的经验，认为一定要把群众的干劲，引导到技术革新和技术革命中来，这样，增产节约的潜力，就会越挖越多，永不枯竭。他们的具体方法是，把群众的力量组织起来，向“五新”——新设计、新材料、新技术、新工艺、新设备进军。
    发展“五新”的效果究竟怎么样？上海有一个起重运输机械厂，最近在一种双梁桥式行车上，进行了产品设计革命，采用了一种新设计，结果原材料节约了三分之一。这也就是为增产创造了一个重要条件——原材料相对地增加了。
    上海有一个冷冻机械厂，生产一种叫P11型的冷风机，原来每台的体积是十点八立方米，现在采用了新设计，只有一点八立方米。体积缩小了六分之五，大大节约了原材料，而制冷量却提高了。
    上海有个泰山化工厂，这个厂的糖精车间，由于不断实行了工艺改革，生产流程大大缩短。去年上半年，省出一座六百多平方米的楼房和一百多台设备。到了去年年底，又省出一层楼和七台设备。其它车间也向糖精车间学习，空出的厂房越来越多，为增加新产品的生产创造了条件。
    一切产品都是要用原材料的。在技术革新和技术革命中，大抓新型钢材、新型化工原材料以及其它新材料，是把增产节约不断向前推进的一个重要环节。“如果我们不把新型的原材料突上去，要想攀登高峰是困难的。”上海的同志们，不仅看到近处，还看到远处，他们把新材料的试制和生产，列为今年增产节约运动和赶超世界先进水平的重点，这是有十分重要意义的。
    增产靠“五新”，节约也靠“五新”。上海酒精厂，是全国节约用煤的先进单位。前几年，每生产一吨酒精，要用一吨煤，去年已降到六百公斤左右。今年全厂又提出了新的目标：“两吨酒精一吨煤！”这就是说，把生产每吨酒精消耗的煤降到五百公斤。这个厂为什么能这样大幅度的节约煤炭呢？就是因为他们在工艺流程上，采用了一系列的新技术。
    综合利用，是节约资源的最有效的方法，但是要实行煤、石油、木材等综合利用，也必须要采取适当的新技术、新工艺。
    建立在新技术基础上的生产能力的迅速提高，有力地促进了产品质量的不断提高。采用新技术、用大协作的方法来组织生产，对于好中求多、好中求快、好中求省，都有很好的效果，这些是上海在实践中证明了的。
    芦席棚和现代化
    采用“五新”，也就是用最少的人力、物力、财力，生产出又好、又多、又省的产品。可是依靠谁来创造这“五新”呢？主要是靠上级拨新设备、新材料，还是主要靠少数的干部和技术人员？上海的经验是，两者都不是。而是主要靠群众，靠芦席棚下闹革命。
    上海的各个工业企业，最近正掀起一个学习卫海铁工厂的热潮。这个地处杨树浦的二百多人的卫海厂，原来实际上是一个由十二家小铁匠铺合并起来的“大铁匠铺”。很大一部分厂房，是用芦席棚搭起的。除了两台皮带钻床、一台冲床和二十几把铁锤以外，他们再没有什么象样的“武器”了。但是他们拥有毛泽东思想这个强大的武器，这些革命的铁匠，在芦席棚下，用自己的双手，造出了许多效率很高的机械化的专用设备，从而造出了全国第一流的钢板弹簧。
    在一定的条件下，芦席棚和现代化是并不矛盾的。工人阶级的革命精神，促进着工业的现代化。
    当我们访问这个工厂的时候，看到他们正在自己动手建设新的厂房。芦席棚快要让位给现代建筑，但是芦席棚下闹革命的精神照样存在。他们并不以全国第一流的产品为满足，正在努力向世界上最好的钢板弹簧的目标奋勇前进！
    群众的创造力无穷　技术革新无止境
    “潜力究竟有多大？在群众发动以前，我们自己也闹不清楚。”这也是我们在上海访问的过程中，常常听到的一句话。在群众一旦发动起来以后，人们就会看到群众的创造力确是无穷无尽的，技术革新和技术革命也确是没有止境的。
    上海机床厂，是一个现代化的大工厂。它生产一种高级的、精密的螺纹磨床。为了适应我国工业发展的更广泛的需要，这个厂决定生产一种结构简化，又轻、又小、又便宜的，但却是精密的螺纹磨床。可是生产这种新磨床既没有经验，也没有现成的数据。怎么办？还是老办法：找群众。从老工人中聘请的二十几个业余设计研究员，出了许多好主意。结果只用了四个月，就完成了设计任务。零件从一千五百个减到五百个，但却保证了高精度。
    当我们到这个工厂的时候，图纸已经出来，正在积极准备小批生产这种磨床，在五月份就能和用户见面了。
    “群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的……”我们在上海看到的许多事实，一再证明毛泽东同志的这个教导，是一个千古不变的真理。
    群众发动起来，潜力犹如泉涌。在上海，我们看到了真正的技术革新的群众运动。
    一个重要的战略方向
    在上海的增产节约运动的新高潮中，还给我们一个突出的感觉，这就是把赶超国际上先进的科学技术水平，作为增产节约运动的一个很重要的内容。他们说，只有努力发展新技术，赶上和超过世界先进水平，才能进一步提高产品质量和发展新产品，更好地支援全国各地的建设，更好地完成国家交给的各项任务。他们说：这是一个重要的战略方向。
    上海的同志们，牢牢记住了毛泽东同志的话：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”这实际上是同帝国主义、现代修正主义的一场斗争，在这场斗争中，上海负有重要的责任。
    上海的同志们还说，进行这场斗争，必须有明确的阶级斗争观念，必须有压倒一切的革命气概。这就是政治。他们正在这个政治的统帅下，有重点地、有目标地从事着许多最新技术的研究、试验和应用。同时，各行各业，各个单位都有自己的赶超目标。
    注意按客观规律办事
    群众的干劲越来越大，增产节约的办法越来越多，越要注意按客观规律办事。上海的同志们说：技术革新和技术革命日益发展，采用“五新”日益广泛，就更要强调严格的科学态度，强调一切经过试验。几年来，他们遵循着一条原则：任何一项不成熟、不可靠、没有把握的重大措施，不要轻易在生产上大面积推广。
    上海纺织行业，这几年试验成功了不少新技术、新工艺，其中很多是带有革命性的变革，但是他们并没有急于一下全面推广，而是先选择一个厂作样板，然后再逐步推广。他们认为这样脚步才能不乱，才能真正跑得快，不走回头路。
    首先不去突出政治，把增产节约运动只是作为一个经济运动，一个生产运动，或者只从技术着眼，只是少数人来挖潜力，那末潜力确是有限的。如果首先用毛泽东思想挂帅，把政治放在首要地位，把增产节约运动，也作为一个政治运动来领导，抓革命，促生产，抓革命化，促现代化，把思想政治工作，落实到技术革新和技术革命中去，充分发挥人的创造力，向“五新”要潜力，那末，潜力就会愈挖愈多。这是我们在上海访问中感到的一个最深的体会。
