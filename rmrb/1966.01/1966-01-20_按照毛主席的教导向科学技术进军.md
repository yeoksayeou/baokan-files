    March Towards Science and Technology According to Chairman Mao's Teachings
    Kou Zhihan, Worker of the Dongting Agricultural Machinery Iron Production and Repair Cooperative, Ding County, Hebei

    Editor's Note: Comrade Kou Zhihan, a youth from a poor peasant family and a graduate of junior primary school, accumulated rich production experience and learned a great deal of scientific and technological knowledge while participating in agricultural production and studying on his own for ten years, making valuable contributions to agricultural implement reform and agricultural electrification. The path taken by Comrade Kou Zhihan, like that taken by Comrade Cai Zuquan, proves that the close integration of scientific and technological research with production practice is the correct path for developing science and technology in our country and also the correct path for cultivating scientific and technological talents in our country.

    I am twenty-six years old this year and was born into a poor peasant family. It was only after the liberation of my hometown that my family turned over. In 1953, I graduated from junior primary school and, following the Party's teachings, participated in agricultural production. Under the care of the Party branch in my village, I successively trial-produced new-style agricultural implements such as double-shared plows, bean planters, walking-stick seeders, and single-wheeled drills. The Party gave me great honor for the small achievements I made. In 1955, at the age of fifteen, I was named an activist in youth socialist construction and attended the county, provincial, and national conferences of activists in youth socialist construction, where I saw our great leader Chairman Mao for the first time.

      In 1957, I also attended the Third National Congress of the Communist
  Youth League, and I saw Chairman Mao for the second time. At this time, I was
  already a glorious Communist Party member and served as the production
  team leader of the agricultural cooperative. After the meeting, I was transferred
  to the Dongting Iron Factory as a worker. After several years of arduous
  efforts in the iron factory, I have made some achievements. Last October, when
  Chairman Mao received labor models from industry and agriculture who were
  attending the 16th anniversary National Day celebrations in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People, I saw our respected leader and mentor – Chairman Mao – for the third time, and my heart was so excited that it almost jumped out of my chest.

      Looking back over the past ten years, my achievements in production
  are due to the Party's care and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. For the
  past ten years, I have consistently studied Chairman Mao's works, having
  read through Volumes One to Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and
  I have read more than twenty articles, including "On Practice," "On
  Contradiction," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Serve the People," dozens of times. Through study, I have drawn tremendous
  strength from Chairman Mao's works and understood why and how to serve
  the people, serve the peasants, and serve agricultural electrification wholeheartedly. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, I have combined labor practice with spare-time study of scientific knowledge, and I have now studied many courses in the university's electrical engineering department, such as advanced mathematics, mechanics of materials, engineering mechanics, electrical machinery, electrical engineering, and electrical machine design. At the same time, I have also learned to repair many different types of electric motors, repair radio receivers, do blacksmithing, do electric welding, and also learned drafting.
  Learning Chairman Mao's works for the revolution and for conquering the scientific fortress
    At the 1955 conference of heroes, I heard the Party's grand call for the First Five-Year Plan and the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. When I learned that building socialism and communism must realize electrification, and that our countryside would one day "have lights without oil and till the land without oxen," how eagerly I hoped to contribute to such an undertaking! But, was working for electrification something unattainable for a small youth who had only graduated from junior primary school? At that time, I asked some scientific workers attending the meeting how I should strive. The comrades warmly told me to study, study, and study again. Some also introduced me to concrete learning experiences, telling me which books to study at the beginning. The comrades also said: "If you have any difficulties, study Chairman Mao's works. Reading Chairman Mao's books will make your heart clear and bright, give you direction, give you strength, and make you forge ahead…" I was so happy that my heart blossomed upon hearing everyone's kind guidance. Before the end of this conference, I wrote a guarantee to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and swore: "I will use all my energy to study well, work hard at experiments, and contribute all my strength and even my life to building a new electrified countryside!"

    After this conference of heroes, I borrowed the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from a teacher in my village and began to study Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings and in a relatively serious manner. After reading "Serve the People," I thought: What am I researching science and technology for? It can only be to serve the people! After reading "On Protracted War" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," I thought: No matter how great the difficulties or how much time it takes, I must conquer the scientific and cultural fortress… Thus, for the past ten years, I have insisted on reading the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" regularly, and when I have problems, I focus on reading the relevant articles, without interruption. Through more than ten years of practice, I feel that: "Those engaged in scientific and technological work should first study Marxism-Leninism and study Mao Zedong Thought. Otherwise, they will have no strength and no direction. Putting Mao Zedong Thought in command in everything will shorten the journey to scaling the peak of science."
      Persevere and dare to climb the peak of science and technology
    From 1955, I formulated a self-study plan. Every week I studied Chairman Mao's works five times, each time for half an hour to an hour, and the rest of my spare time was spent studying electrical machinery science knowledge.

    When I started studying, the first hurdle I encountered was: my cultural level was low, and I could not understand many natural science books. When I first learned algebra, I encountered an exercise that I pondered for eight consecutive days after finishing work, and I could not figure it out at all. Several nights, I stared at it without being able to solve it. When I was really sleepy, I washed my head with toothpaste and cold water. At that time, I was so angry that I threw myself on the kang and cried, not wanting to study anymore. But then, the images of Liu Hulan, Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, and many other revolutionary martyrs and youth heroes flooded into my mind. I thought: For the sake of socialism, I must conquer it! At this time, I opened Chairman Mao's work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and read it word by word, and then I studied "On Protracted War." The great Mao Zedong Thought illuminated my heart. Although the mountain is high, digging a little reduces it a little; although modern science and technology are difficult to understand, can't they be learned little by little? Chairman Mao said: "The War of Resistance Against Japan is a protracted war, and China will be the victor in the end – this is our conclusion." Shouldn't my march towards science also be a protracted war? The War of Resistance Against Japan lasted eight years, and I will first prepare to fight for four years. If that doesn't work, I will fight for eight years. If eight years doesn't work, I will study for ten or twenty years, and I will definitely be able to win in the end. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I was greatly encouraged in spirit, strengthened my determination to study, saw the prospect of victory, and rekindled my revolutionary spirit.

      According to the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, to continue attacking science and technology, I need to read a large number of books, but where can I find the electrical machinery theory and scientific books we need in our remote town? I decided to overcome difficulties, save money, and buy books myself. In the past eight years, I have bought thousands of books. Someone said to me: "Wouldn't it be nice if you used this money to buy a watch or a bicycle?" I replied: "Although watches and bicycles are helpful for life and work, they cannot make me improve my awareness and increase my knowledge. Chairman Mao's books point out the direction for me to move forward and enable me to learn the skills to serve the people. Science and technology books can help me climb the peak of scientific and cultural, which is of great benefit to socialism!"
    When I was studying Russian, I encountered the difficulty of not being able to pronounce correctly. I bought a Russian pronunciation chart and opened my mouth and stuck out my tongue according to the chart, but I still couldn't pronounce it accurately. I went to Ding County No. 1 Middle School to ask foreign language teachers for advice. Dongting Town is thirty li from the county seat, and I often rode my bicycle to study after work, entering the city in the evening and returning overnight. Sometimes I was too tired, or I encountered difficulties and didn't want to go to study anymore, but when I thought about the difficulties that the Party and Chairman Mao had overcome, I increased my confidence and courage, and my spirit of optimism grew even greater.
        Learn humbly from everyone, respectfully
    Chairman Mao said: "We should go among the masses and learn from the masses…" "We must learn economic work from all experts (regardless of who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly." I firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching, and regard all experienced workers, peasants, cadres, and scientific workers as living textbooks, living dictionaries, and as my respectable teachers, and humbly ask them for advice.

    I don't miss any opportunity to learn from others. The county held several conferences, and I was asked to manage the amplifiers. When the delegates had group discussions, I went to the middle school to audit lectures. Once, when I attended the county Communist Youth League Congress, I discovered that there were eleven high school students among the service personnel, so I used the break time to ask them to help me learn foreign languages. When I heard that several university students had returned home for vacation, I visited them several times during my spare time to ask for advice.

    I made many friends and learned from many teachers when I went to Shijiazhuang to buy electrical materials.
    I started talking to a passenger on the train. When he saw me reading "Electrical Machine Design," he asked if I understood it. I guessed he was an expert, so I asked him for advice. This comrade worked in the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and I wrote down his name and address at that time and established contact by writing letters after returning home. When I came to Shijiazhuang, I met a customer at the waste material processing station in Qiaodong District who also came to buy electrical materials. I asked him what he bought it for, and he said it was for repairing electric motors. After three questions and two talks, it turned out to be a fellow worker: this customer was a worker at the Handan Electrical Appliance Repair Shop. I suggested that we both move into a hotel and exchange experiences and study problems together. Staying in the hotel waiting for the yarn to be processed, I opened the telephone directory and prepared to call a friend, and suddenly found the words "Shijiazhuang Electrical Machinery School," and I was overjoyed and thought: "There are still a few questions I haven't figured out. Wouldn't it be good to ask them for advice?" In this way, I came to Shijiazhuang Electrical Machinery School and had a conversation with two teachers, which helped me a lot.
    Use your brain, practice earnestly, and never swallow anything whole
    I firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "You should think hard about everything with your brain." "We must advocate thinking, learn the methods of analyzing things, and develop the habit of analyzing." I followed Chairman Mao's teaching to conduct self-study, paying attention to using my brain, thinking independently, and never swallowing anything whole or copying blindly.

    I have three teachers, namely: books, the masses, and practice. But books are dead things, and only by learning from the masses and learning in practice can I learn living things. My learning formula is: first read, second think, third compare (compare observations), and fourth do. When I learn electrical machinery, I am not satisfied with understanding certain principles, but instead I get an electric motor and study it personally. My welding technology, radio knowledge, and repair technology were all obtained through comparison with the principles explained in the books and through personal practice. Since 1959, I have conducted hundreds of experiments on the principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, optics, etc., and hundreds of experiments on electrical engineering projects.

    Learning and practice are the process of dealing with new things and gradually becoming familiar with and mastering the laws of new things. Therefore, we cannot be intimidated by "never experienced, never seen," and we cannot be afraid of failure. We must have a spirit of adventure and creativity in order to learn real knowledge and skills and to achieve final success. This is another important experience I have gained from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    In the spring of 1964, Liu Luogu, deputy captain of the Nanqi Brigade, came to me and said that there was a Japanese-made electric motor that had been used for less than a month and then stopped working. He had gone to several factories and dragged it around for three years without being able to repair it, asking if I could repair it. I hesitated when I heard this, because I had never experienced it and never seen it. But then I thought, the Party and Chairman Mao taught us that what foreigners have, we must have, and what foreigners don't have, we must also have. A small electric motor, foreigners can make it, but we can't repair it? What a joke! I immediately answered firmly: "Bring it here, we will definitely find a way to repair it!"

    When I saw it, I had never seen it before. At that time, I couldn't help but frown and feel stunned. I thought, Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, but using is also learning, and it is even more important learning." If I want to really do some work for the realization of electrification in the countryside, I must study, learn, and improve from electric motor repair. Thinking of this, I further increased my courage and confidence in overcoming difficulties. I first carried out careful observation and analysis, and compared it with many other different types of electric motors to study, and put forward various assumptions to eliminate eleven theoretical and practical problems that needed to be solved. Then I took these problems to find answers from books and asked for advice from the masses. Finally, the first assembled test was about to begin. When the power was turned on, the electric motor did turn. Unfortunately, the original design was 1,450 revolutions per minute, but now it was only turning 500.

    I am neither passively disappointed nor indifferent to failure. At this time, I opened Chairman Mao's "On Practice," and every word of "practice, knowledge, again practice, again knowledge" shone with golden light, which gave me courage and made me feel that failure also has its value, just like climbing a ladder to success. Each time I fail, I get closer to success. Isn't it a step forward for the electric motor to go from not turning to turning? Then, after repeated experiments, failure, improvement, again failure, again improvement, this electric motor, which people thought could not be repaired, was assembled. It has now been used for more than a year and has no problems.

    The success of this time of moving "foreign stuff" made me grow in ambition, add knowledge, and learn skills. I felt that the dead knowledge in books was increasingly becoming living knowledge. I also deeply felt that although our factory is small, has no equipment, and many things have not been repaired in the past, as long as we follow the path taught by Chairman Mao: practice, knowledge, again practice, again knowledge, many seemingly profound and complex technologies are just like a layer of window paper, which can be broken with a poke. There is nothing great, and you can completely learn it!
    Serving the people is the greatest pleasure
    I know deeply how I grew up, where my personal knowledge and technology came from, and where they should be used. I once wrote in a report to the Party organization: "Great mother – the Communist Party of China, how could I get so much help from university students and support from scientists, from self-study from junior primary school to university, if it weren't for the light of Mao Zedong Thought, if it weren't for the socialist system, could I have achieved it? If it weren't for the Party, a poor child like me who was trampled underfoot in the old society wouldn't even be alive today! I will always listen to Chairman Mao's words and fight with proletarian feelings. I have no reason not to do this."

    I study for agricultural electrification and contribute everything I have learned to agricultural electrification.

    In the winter of 1963, the county organized a production team electrician training class, and I was transferred to be a service worker. A few days after the class started, some students reflected that the teacher's lectures were difficult to understand. I felt that I understood some electrical knowledge and should take the initiative to do some tutoring work to help everyone learn well. For more than two weeks, I ran all over the nine large dormitories where the students lived, giving individual and collective tutoring dozens of times.

    The matter of me tutoring at the county electrician training class spread to the Zhailei Brigade in Dongting Commune. They started using electricity earlier here, and every production team had electric motors. Because the technical personnel could not keep up with the needs, they had burned out an electric motor and a transformer. The team cadres decided to start an electrician training class and asked me to give lectures, so I used my spare time to run more than ten li back and forth to teach electrical knowledge to more than twenty young people in Zhailei. After a period of lectures and tutoring, now each production team in Zhailei has its own electrician, and if there is a small problem with the electric motor, it can be repaired without leaving the village.

    Since last year, with the support of relevant leaders of the county and district, our Dongting Machinery Iron Cooperative has gradually expanded its electric motor repair business and established an electrician workshop. If I don't understand the technology, I will work hard with everyone, and in a few months everyone will have initially mastered the general electric motor repair technology. Without equipment, with the help of veteran worker Li Wushen and others, we designed and manufactured several necessary equipment such as rotor short-circuit testers ourselves. In order to better support agriculture, we have established a system to ensure quality and convenience to the masses, and we are available to the production team whenever they call and send them back after repairing them. Now our small electrician workshop in the small machine and iron cooperative not only repairs electric motors in our district and county, but also repairs electric motors in other counties.

    More and more electric motors are being sent to our door, and the masses have deep feelings for us. But I thought: Why do rural electrical equipment often fail? In order to understand this thoroughly, I often go to production teams and fields to conduct investigations and visits to understand the management and maintenance of electric motors. Through investigation, I feel more and more that it is very important to hand over the technology to the peasants. Obviously, it is not enough to train electricians in only one or two villages!

    At this time, I planned to compile some materials on electrical motor maintenance knowledge. The district leaders supported me and gave me a roll of paper. So I compiled textbooks, engraved steel plates, and printed handouts in my spare time. I printed five or six hundred copies and sent them to electricians in more than eighty production teams.

    Some people feel that it is incomprehensible for me to spread technology so widely, and they say that I am a big fool. Some people say: "You rely on repairing electric motors for a living. If you pass on all the technology to others, what will you eat?" I replied: "Doctors hope that the people of the whole country are healthy, and I hope that the electric motors in the whole country will not have problems. Serving the people is the greatest pleasure, and it is also realizing my highest ideal!"

专栏：

    按照毛主席的教导向科学技术进军
    河北定县东亭机铁生产修配合作社工人　　寇志寒
    编者按：寇志寒同志，一个贫农家庭出身的、高小毕业的青年，在参加农业生产中，一边劳动，一边自学，十年如一日，积累了丰富的生产经验，学到了许多科学技术知识，为农具改革和农业电气化作出了可贵的贡献。寇志寒同志走过的道路，同蔡祖泉同志走过的道路一样，证明了：科学技术研究工作同生产实践紧密结合，是发展我国科学技术的正确道路，也是培养我国科学技术人材的正确道路。
    我今年二十六岁，出生在一个贫农家庭里。家乡解放后，我们一家人才翻了身。一九五三年我高小毕业，按照党的教导参加了农业生产。在我村党支部的关怀下，曾先后试制了双铧犁、点豆机、拐棍儿点种机、独角耧等新式农具。我作出了这么一点点成绩，党却给了我很大荣誉。一九五五年我十五岁那年被评为青年社会主义建设积极分子，出席了县、省和全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，第一次见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。
      一九五七年，我又出席了青年团第三次全国代表大会，第
  二次见到毛主席。这时我已是一个光荣的共产党员了，担任农
  业社的生产队长。会后，我被调到东亭铁厂当了工人。在铁厂经
  过几年来的刻苦努力，作出了一些成绩。去年十月，毛主席在
  人民大会堂宴会厅里接见参加建国十六周年观礼的工农业劳动模范的时候，我第三次又见到我们敬爱的领袖和导师——毛主
  席，激动得我的心都快跳了出来。
      回想十年来，我在生产上搞出了一些成绩，就是由于党的关怀，毛泽东思想的哺育。十年来，我一直坚持学习毛主席著作，已把《毛泽东选集》一至四卷通读了一遍，其中《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》等二十几篇文章，反反复复读过几十遍。通过学习，从毛主席著作中吸取了巨大的力量，懂得了为什么和怎么样全心全意地为人民服务，为农民服务，为农业电气化服务。在毛泽东思想指导下，我结合劳动实践业余学习科学知识，到现在已经学习了高等数学、材料力学、工程力学、电机学、电工学、电机设计等大学电机系的许多课程。同时，还学会修理许多不同类型的电动机，修理无线电收音机，会打铁，会电焊，还学会了制图。
  为革命、为攻克科学堡垒，学习毛主席著作
    在一九五五年群英会上，我听到了党关于第一个五年建设计划、关于农业互助合作运动的雄伟号召。当我知道了建设社会主义和共产主义必须实现电气化，知道了咱们的农村将来会
  “点灯不用油，耕地不用牛”的时候，我是多么热切地盼望能为这样一番事业做出贡献啊！但是，为电气化而工作，这对于我一个高小毕业的小青年来说，是不是高不可攀呀？当时，我问了一些出席会议的科学工作者，应当怎样努力。同志们热情地告诉我，要学习、学习、再学习。有的还向我介绍了具体学习经验，告诉我开头该学那些书。同志们还说：“有什么困难事就学习毛主席著作，一读毛主席的书，就会心明眼亮，就会有方向，就会有力量，就会勇往直前……。”我听了大家亲切的指导，乐得心里象开了花。这次大会结束以前，我向党中央和毛主席写了保证书，并宣誓：“要以全部精力，搞好学习，努力试验，为建设电气化的新农村，贡献出一切力量以至生命！”
    在这次群英会以后，我向村里一位老师借了《毛泽东选集》，开始带着浓厚的阶级感情比较认真地学习着毛主席著作。读了《为人民服务》，我就想：我钻研科学技术，为了什么？只能是为人民服务！读了《论持久战》、《愚公移山》，我就想：不管有多大的困难，要花多少时间，一定得攻克科学文化堡垒……。就这样，十年来，我坚持平常通读《毛泽东选集》，有了问题就重点读有关的文章，一直没有间断。通过十来年的实践，使我感到：“搞科学技术工作的人首先应学马列主义，学习毛泽东思想。不然，就没有力量，没有方向。事事以毛泽东思想挂帅，攀登科学高峰的里程就会缩短。”
      坚持不懈，敢于攀登科学技术高峰
    从一九五五年，我就制订了自学计划。每个星期学习五次毛主席著作，每次学习半个小时至一个小时，其余业余时间学习电机科学知识。
    开始学习，遇到的头一个难关是：文化浅，许多自然科学书籍看不懂。初学代数，曾经碰到一个习题，连着八天，劳动完毕就琢磨，总也闹不明白，几个晚上两眼直盯盯地看着没法解决。实在困了，就用牙粉加冷水洗一洗头。当时气得我一下扎在炕上哭了起来，不想再学下去了。但是，一转念，刘胡兰、黄继光、董存瑞等多少个革命先烈和青年英雄的形象涌现在我的眼前。我想：为了社会主义，一定要攻上去！这时我翻开毛主席著作《愚公移山》，一字一句地读起来，接着又学了《论持久战》。伟大的毛泽东思想，照亮了我的心。山虽高，挖一点少一点；现代科学技术虽然不好懂，不也可以一点一点地学到手吗？毛主席说：“抗日战争是持久战，最后胜利是中国的——这就是我们的结论。”我向科学进军不也该打持久战吗？抗日战
  争打了八年，我先准备打四年，不行的话，也打它八年，八年
  不行就学十年二十年，最后一定能够胜利。学过毛主席著作，我在精神上受到了很大鼓舞，坚定了学习的决心，看到了胜利的前景，重新振起革命精神。
      按照毛主席指出的方向，继续攻科学技术，要读大量书籍，可是在我们这偏远的小镇，那里能够找到我们需要的电机理论和科学书籍呢？我决定克服困难，省吃俭用，自己买书。八年来，我买了上千本书。有人对我说：“你用这些钱买个手表、自行车，不是挺好吗？”我回答说：“手表、自行车虽然对生活和工作有帮助，可是并不能使我提高觉悟，增长知识。毛主席的书指明我前进的方向，使我学到为人民服务的本领。科学技术的书，能帮助我攀登科学文化高峰，这对社会主义的好处就大多
  了！”
    在自学俄文时，我碰到了不会发音的困难。我买来了一幅俄语发音挂图，按照图样张嘴吐舌头，还是念不准确。我就去定县一中向外语教师求教。东亭镇离县城三十里，我常常在下班之后，登上自行车去学习，傍晚进城，连夜回来。有时太累了，或有了困难，不想再去学习的时候，但一想党和毛主席克服了那些困难，自己就增加了信心和勇气，乐观主义的精神就更大了。
        处处拜师求教，恭恭敬敬地学
    毛主席说过：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，……”“我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。”我牢牢记住毛主席的这个教导，把一切有经验的工人、农民、干部、科学工作者，当作活教材、活字典，当作自己可尊敬的老师，恭恭敬敬地向他们求教。
    我拜师求教，一切机会都不放过。县里几次开大会，让我去管理扩音器，当代表们小组讨论时，我就去中学旁听讲课。一次我参加县团代会，发现服务人员中有十一个高中学生，就利用休息时间，请他们帮助学习外文。听说有几个大学生放假回家来了，我就利用业余时间几次走访求教。
    我去石家庄买电料，就交了许多朋友，拜了许多老师。
    在火车上，同一位旅客拉起话来。他见我读《电机设计》，他问我懂不懂，我估计他是内行，就提出问题请教。这位同志在水电部工作，我当时记下了他的姓名、地址，回家后写信建立了联系。来到石家庄，在桥东区废料处理站，遇见一个顾客也来买电料。我问人家买了做什么，人家说是修理电动机。三问两谈，原来是同行：这个顾客是邯郸电器修配社的工人。我向他建议我俩搬到一个旅馆住，一起交流经验，研究问题。在旅馆住下等着加工纱线，我翻开电话簿，准备打电话找位朋友，忽然发现：“石家庄电机学校”字样，心里一喜，想道：“还有几个问题没弄明白，去请教他们不好吗？”这样，我就来到石家庄电机学校，同两位教师作了一次交谈，对我帮助很大。
    开动脑筋，认真实践，决不囫囵吞枣
    我牢牢地记着毛主席的教导：“凡事应该用脑筋好好想一想。”“必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯”。我遵照毛主席的这个教导进行自学，注意开动脑筋，独立思考，决不囫囵吞枣，照葫芦画瓢。
    我有三个老师，就是：书本，群众，实践。但书本是死的东西，只有向群众学习，在实践中学习，才能学到活的东西，我的学习公式是：一读、二想、三对（对照观察）、四干。我学电机学，不以明白某些原理为满足，而是弄来一架电动机，亲自揣摸。我的电焊技术、无线电的知识和修理技术，都是经过同书上讲的道理对照，经过亲身实践而取得的。从一九五九年以来，我先后对力学、热学、光学等方面的原理做过上百次实验，而对电工学方面的项目就做了一百几十次实验。
    学习、实践，是同新事物打交道，逐步熟悉并掌握新事物规律的过程。所以，不能被“没经过、没见过”吓住了，不能怕失败。必须有股子闯劲和创造性，才能学到真正的知识和本领，才能获得最后成功。这是我学、用毛主席著作的又一重要体会。
    一九六四年春，南齐大队副大队长刘洛固来找我，说有一台日本造电动机，买来用了不到一个月就不转了，跑了好几个厂子，拖了三年没有修好，问能不能修。我一听犯了犹豫，没经过，没见过呀。可是又一想，党和毛主席教导咱，外国有的我们要有，外国没有的我们也要有。小小一台电动机，外国人造得了，咱就修不了？笑话！我当时斩钉截铁地回答说：“拉来吧，我们一定想办法修好！”
    拉来一看，果然没见过。当时不由地皱起了眉头，发起愣来。我想，毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”要想真正为农村实现电气化做点工作，就必须从电机修理中研究、学习和提高。想到这里，又进一步增强了战胜困难的勇气和信心。我首先进行了仔细的观察和分析，并把它同别的许多不同类型电动机对照研究，提出种种设想，排出十一个需要解决的理论问题和实际问题。接着我就带着这些问题，从书本上找答案，到群众中去请教。终于，第一次成装的试验就要进行了。一合闸，电动机果然转动起来了。可惜，原设计每分钟一千四百五十转，现在它却只转五百。
    对于失败，我既不消极失望，也不满不在乎。这时又翻开了毛主席的《实践论》，“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的每个字都闪着金光，使我鼓足了勇气，使我觉得失败也有它的价值，好象登上走向成功的梯子一样，每失败一次，就离成功近一些。电动机由不转到转，不就是一个进步吗？接着经过反复实验，失败、改进、再失败、再改进，这台被人们认为无法修理的电动机组装起来了。现在已经用了一年多。没有毛病。
    这一次动“洋玩意”的成功，使我长了志气，添了知识，学了本领。我感到，书本上的死知识正在越来越多的变成活知识。也深深地感到：虽然我们的厂子小，没啥设备，许多东西过去也没修过，但是，只要照着毛主席教导的路数：实践、认识、再实践、再认识，不少似乎高深复杂的技术也不过象层窗户纸，一戳就破了，没有什么了不起，完全可以学到手！
    为人民服务是最大的愉快
    我深深知道自己是怎样成长起来的，知道个人的知识和技术是从哪里来的，应当用到哪里去。我在给党组织的一份报告里曾写道：“伟大的母亲——中国共产党，我能够得到那么多大学生的帮助、科学家的支持，由高小自学到大学，不是毛泽东思想的照耀，不是社会主义制度，我能达到吗？要不是党，我这个在旧社会被践踏在脚底下的穷孩子，活都活不到今天！我要永远听毛主席的话，怀着无产阶级的感情去战斗。我没有任何理由不去这样做。”
    我是为了农业电气化而学习，又把学到的一切贡献给农业电气化。
    一九六三年冬天，县里办生产队电工训练班，我被调来当服务员。开课不几天，有的学员反映，老师讲课不好懂。我觉得自己懂一些电的知识，应当主动做些辅导工作，帮助大家学习好。两个多星期，我跑遍了学员们住的九个大宿舍，个别和集体辅导几十次。
    我在县上电工训练班作辅导的事，传到东亭公社寨里大队。这里办电较早，每个生产队都有电动机。因为技术人材赶不上需要，曾经烧坏过一台电动机和一台变压器。队干部决定开办电工训练班，让我去讲课，我于是利用业余时间，来回跑十几里路，给寨里二十几个青年传授电的知识。经过一段的讲课辅导，现在寨里每个生产队都有了自己的电工，电动机有个小毛病，不出村就能修好。
    去年以来，在县、区有关领导的支持下，我们东亭机铁社逐步扩大了修理电机的业务，成立了电工车间。不懂技术，我就和大家一起苦练硬工夫，几个月大家就初步掌握了一般电动机的修理技术。没有设备，在老工人李五申等的帮助下，自己设计制造了转子短路测定器等几种必要的设备。为了更好的支援农业，我们订出保证质量、方便群众的制度，生产队随叫随到，修好送回去。现在我们这个小机铁社的小电工车间，不仅修理本区、本县的电动机，而且也修起外县的电动机。
    越来越多的电动机送上门来，群众对我们有了深厚的感情。但是，我想：农村电器设备为什么经常出故障呢？为了吃透这个，我经常到生产队和地里进行调查访问，了解电动机的管理维修情况。通过调查我越觉得把技术交给农民非常重要，只是去一两个村培养电工显然赶不上需要呀！
    这时，我打算编写一些有关电机维修知识的材料。区领导支持我，给了我一卷纸。于是我就在业余时间编教材，刻钢版，印起讲义来。印了五六百份，送给八十多个生产队的电工。
    我这样大传特传技术，有人感到不可理解，说我是个大傻瓜。有人说：“你是靠修电动机吃饭的，你把技术都传给了别人，你吃什么呢？”我回答说：“医生希望全国人民健康，我就希望全国的电动机不出毛病。为人民服务就是最大的愉快，也是在实现着自己最高的理想！”
