    Another Activity of Using Hong Kong as a Base for Expanding Aggressive War
    Frequent Entry and Exit of U.S. Nuclear-Powered Warships in Hong Kong
    Two More U.S. Sailors Rob a Taxi Driver in Hong Kong
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 28th - According to today's reports in Hong Kong's *Ta Kung Pao* and *Wen Wei Po*, following the arrival of the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier “Enterprise” in Hong Kong on the morning of the 26th, the U.S. nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser “Bainbridge” also arrived in Hong Kong's inner harbor on the evening of the 26th.

    It is understood that as of 12:00 today, there are already eight U.S. warships anchored in Hong Kong waters. They are: "Enterprise," "Bainbridge," "Robert A. Owens," "Hawkins," "Caliente," "Duncan," "Finch," and the submarine "Dogfish."

    Since October 1964, U.S. nuclear-powered warships have entered Hong Kong waters three times, totaling four vessels. In addition to the "Enterprise" and "Bainbridge" currently in Hong Kong, the other two were the nuclear-powered submarine "Seadragon," which came to Hong Kong on October 27, 1964, and another nuclear-powered submarine, "Halibut," which came to Hong Kong at the end of October last year.

    According to Hong Kong's *South China Morning Post*, from January 1st to January 27th this year, U.S. warships have visited Hong Kong 27 times.

    At a time when the United States is attempting to further expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, the frequent entry and exit of U.S. warships, including nuclear-powered warships, into Hong Kong, using Hong Kong as a base for expanding its aggressive war, has aroused great anger among Hong Kong residents.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 28th - According to a report in Hong Kong's *New Evening Post* on the 27th, two more U.S. sailors robbed a taxi driver in Hong Kong in the early hours of the 27th. This is the second incident of U.S. soldiers committing robbery in Hong Kong in the past ten days.

    The report said that at 4:00 a.m. on the 27th, two U.S. sailors wearing U.S. Navy uniforms, while riding in a taxi, used a hard object to knock the driver Chen Huanzhang unconscious, robbed him of 110 Hong Kong dollars and three U.S. dollars in cash, as well as some miscellaneous items, and fled.

    把香港作为扩大侵略战争基地的又一活动
    美国核动力军舰频繁进出香港
    又有两名美国水兵在香港抢劫出租汽车司机
    新华社香港二十八日电  据香港《大公报》和《文汇报》今天报道，继美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”于二十六日上午开到香港后，配有导弹的美国核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”又在二十六日晚上开到香港内港。
    据悉，到今天十二时止，停泊在香港海面的美国军舰已有八艘，它们是：“企业号”、“班布里奇号”、“罗伯特斯号”、“霍金斯号”、“卡连特号”、“邓肯号”、“芬奇号”和潜水艇“狗头鱼号”。
    自一九六四年十月以来，美国核动力军舰已有三次共四艘进入香港海面。除目前在港的“企业号”和“班布里奇号”以外，另外两艘是一九六四年十月二十七日来香港的核动力潜艇“海龙号”和去年十月底来香港的另一艘核动力潜艇“大鲹鱼号”。
    据香港《南华早报》报道，从今年一月一日到二十七日，来香港的美国军舰已达二十七艘次。
    在美国妄图进一步扩大侵略越南战争的时候，美国军舰包括核动力军舰如此频繁地进出香港，把香港作为它扩大侵略战争的活动基地，香港居民对此表示极大愤怒。
    新华社香港二十八日电据香港《新晚报》二十七日报道，又有两名美国水兵二十七日凌晨在香港抢劫出租汽车司机。这是最近十几天来在香港发生的第二起美国兵逞凶抢劫事件。
    报道说，二十七日晨四时，两名穿美国海军军服的美国水兵在乘坐一辆出租汽车途中，用硬物击昏司机陈焕章，在劫去他的现款一百一十元（港币）和美金三元以及一些杂物后逃去。
