    Using Mao Zedong Thought to Command the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    Northwest District Industry and Transportation Conference Calls on All Employees in the Region to Promote the Yan'an Style and Learn from the Daqing Spirit

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently convened the Northwest District Industry and Transportation Conference in Xi'an to review the achievements of industrial and transportation construction in the Northwest and summarize and exchange experiences. The conference called on the vast number of employees in the Northwest region to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, promote the Yan'an style, learn from the Daqing spirit, and extensively and deeply carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, in order to strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    Liu Lantao, First Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting, and Wang Lin, Secretary of the Secretariat, made a report on the situation and tasks of industrial and transportation construction in the Northwest.

    The meeting believed that the industrial production outlook in the Northwest region is undergoing tremendous changes. Heavy industry, chemical industry, light industry, and textile industry, which were almost without foundation in the past, have all achieved considerable development, with rapid increases in products, rapid improvements in quality, and an increasing variety of designs and colors. At present, a new high tide of socialist revolution and socialist production construction is developing vigorously in the Northwest region.

    The tremendous changes in the industrial production outlook reflect the revolutionary spirit of the vast number of employees in the Northwest region who are unwilling to lag behind and determined to transform backwardness into advancement. The experience introductions made by many advanced units and advanced individuals at the meeting showed that in order to revolutionize backwardness, the vast number of employees braved wind and rain, slept in the open, endured great hardships, worked hard, relied on their own efforts, and started their own businesses arduously in production and construction. With the deepening of socialist education, more and more employees have linked the construction of the Northwest with the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland, and with the long-term goal of supporting the revolution of the world's oppressed people, and their production enthusiasm has become increasingly high. They learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn the Daqing revolutionary spirit, learn from Shanghai experience, and learn from the advanced experiences of all parts of the country, combining the revolutionary pioneering spirit with a strict scientific attitude, and continuously leaping forward in industrial production and construction.

    The more than 600 representatives attending the meeting studied the relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and clearly realized that during the period of the Third Five-Year Plan, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are shouldering glorious, great, and arduous tasks. The meeting believed that in order to successfully realize these tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership; to boldly mobilize the masses and implement the mass line; to concentrate forces to fight annihilation wars, pool the wisdom and efforts of the masses, and complete the key construction projects arranged by the state ahead of schedule; to actively develop small and medium-sized enterprises that serve large industries, rural areas, and markets; to vigorously support agriculture; and most fundamentally, to give prominence to politics and adhere to the principle of putting Mao Zedong Thought in command.

    The meeting emphasized that giving prominence to politics is the foundation of enterprise construction. Giving prominence to politics means taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline for all work. The experiences introduced by many advanced units and advanced individuals at the meeting fully proved that no matter when or what work is done, proceeding in accordance with Chairman Mao's thought will lead to progress and victory; departing from Mao Zedong Thought will lead to regression and failure. The meeting believed that class struggle is the key link of the three major revolutionary movements, and with the key link in place, everything else will fall into place. No matter what work is done, it is necessary to first grasp politics, and use politics to command economics, command technology, and command business. The more arduous the task and the tighter the time, the more necessary it is to do a good job in political and ideological work.

    The meeting pointed out that the industrial production level in the Northwest region is still far behind the advanced regions of the country. There are three attitudes towards this situation: one is self-conceit and parochialism, refusing to admit backwardness; another is admitting backwardness, but being self-deprecating, lacking the courage and determination to change backwardness and catch up with and surpass the advanced; and the third is admitting backwardness, unwilling to lag behind, and having lofty ambitions and determination to catch up with and surpass the advanced. The meeting believed that it is necessary to overcome the first two kinds of thinking and advocate the latter kind of thinking. This kind of thinking is in line with the spirit of the general line and the spirit of Daqing.

    The meeting analyzed the huge potential existing in all aspects of industrial construction in the Northwest region, and called on employees of all ethnic groups in the Northwest to extensively and deeply carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, in order to strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, and first of all, to complete the 1966 plan. The meeting pointed out that implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, opposing waste, and practicing increase production and practicing economy is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue, and an issue of carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.

    The meeting pointed out that increase production and practicing economy must rely on the masses and carry out mass movements on a large scale. It is not possible to rely only on a few people to close the door and do calculations, quietly. This is the key issue of whether the increase production and practicing economy movement can be carried out well. All enterprises must boldly mobilize the masses, do everything possible to increase the variety and quantity of products, improve product quality, save raw materials and fuel, reduce costs, and improve labor productivity. All employees must be meticulous in their calculations, and save every penny, every pound of coal, every kilowatt-hour of electricity, every drop of oil, and every inch of steel and wood that can be saved, and use them in the places most urgently needed for national construction.

    The meeting requested that all enterprises determine the focus of increase production and practicing economy based on their specific circumstances. For products needed for national construction and people's livelihood, and for which raw materials are guaranteed, raw materials should be fully utilized to vigorously increase production; for those with difficulties in raw materials, efforts should be made to save raw materials, actively adopt substitute materials, and open up new sources of materials; for products with limited sales, efforts should be made to improve quality and trial-produce new products. Basic construction units must implement the principle of adhering to high standards for technology and low standards for living facilities; even for productive buildings, they must proceed from reality, oppose extravagance, and oppose one-sided pursuit of large, complete, foreign, and new. The meeting requested that all provinces, regions, departments, and enterprises formulate increase production and practice economy plans, put forward specific requirements, so that the vast number of employees have clear goals to strive for, and conduct regular inspections.

    The meeting believed that the socialist construction in the Northwest region is facing a new upsurge. Leaders at all levels must stand at the forefront of the upsurge of production construction, fully recognize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, fully estimate the potential of production, and overcome the phenomenon of cognition lagging behind the situation and leadership lagging behind the masses. All regions, departments, and enterprises must have overall plans and specific arrangements for their work, highlight key points, and implement measures. Leaders at all levels must go deep into reality, adhere to staying at selected spots, strengthen investigation and research, and summarize experiences in a timely manner; they must all be sober-minded promoters, pay close attention to the trends of the mass movement, discover problems in a timely manner, solve problems in a timely manner; cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, care for the lives of the masses, and pay attention to the combination of work and rest.

    This meeting elected twenty red banners from the industrial and transportation front in the Northwest, and called on employees in the entire region to learn from their example. (Attached pictures)

    用毛泽东思想统帅增产节约运动
    西北区工业交通会议号召全区职工发扬延安作风学习大庆精神
    本报讯　中共中央西北局最近在西安召开了西北区工业交通会议，检阅了西北工业交通建设方面的成就，总结和交流了经验。会议号召西北地区广大职工高举毛泽东思想红旗，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，发扬延安作风，学习大庆精神，广泛深入地开展增产节约运动，为实现第三个五年计划而奋斗。
    中共中央西北局第一书记刘澜涛在会上作了重要讲话，书记处书记王林就西北工业交通建设的形势与任务作了报告。
    会议认为，西北区的工业生产面貌正在发生巨大变化。过去几乎是毫无基础的重工业、化学工业、轻工业和纺织工业，都有了相当的发展，产品迅速增加，质量迅速提高，花色品种越来越多。目前，西北地区社会主义革命和社会主义生产建设的新高潮正在蓬勃地发展。
    工业生产面貌的巨大变化，反映了西北区广大职工不甘心落后、立志变落后为先进的革命精神。许多先进单位和先进人物在会上所作的经验介绍中，说明广大职工为了革落后的命，在生产建设中，风餐露宿，饮冰卧雪，吃大苦，耐大劳，自力更生，艰苦创业。随着社会主义教育日益深入，越来越多的职工把建设西北与祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设联系起来，与支援世界被压迫人民革命的远大目标联系起来，生产积极性越来越高。他们学解放军、学大庆革命精神，学上海经验，学全国各地的先进经验，把革命的首创精神与严格的科学态度结合起来，在工业生产建设上不断跃进。
    参加会议的六百多名代表，学习了党中央和毛主席的有关指示，明确地认识到在第三个五年计划期间，西北各族人民担负着光荣、伟大、艰巨的任务。会议认为，胜利地实现这些任务，要加强党的领导；要大胆放手发动群众，贯彻执行群众路线；要集中力量打歼灭战，群策群力，提前完成国家安排的重点建设工程；要积极发展为大工业、为农村、为市场服务的中小型企业；要大力支援农业；其中最根本的，是要突出政治，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅。
    会议强调突出政治是企业建设的根本。突出政治就是以毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指针。许多先进单位和先进人物在会上介绍的经验，都充分证明：无论什么时候，无论什么工作，按照毛主席思想办事就前进，就胜利；离开了毛泽东思想就后退，就失败。会议认为阶级斗争是三大革命运动的纲，纲举才能目张。不管搞什么工作，必须首先抓政治，用政治统帅经济，统帅技术，统帅业务。任务越繁重，时间越紧张，越要做好政治思想工作。
    会议指出：目前西北地区的工业生产水平跟全国先进地区比较，还有很大的差距。对待这种状况，有三种态度：一种是夜郎自大，坐井观天，不承认落后；一种是承认落后，但妄自菲薄，没有改变落后，赶上和超过先进的勇气和决心；再一种是承认落后，不甘落后，有雄心壮志，决心赶上和超过先进。会议认为必须克服前两种思想，提倡后一种思想。这种思想才符合总路线的精神，大庆的精神。
    会议分析了西北地区工业建设中各方面存在的巨大潜力，号召西北各族职工广泛深入地开展增产节约运动，为实现第三个五年计划，首先是为完成一九六六年的计划而奋斗。会议指出，贯彻勤俭建国的方针，反对浪费，实行增产节约，不仅是一个经济问题，而且是一个政治问题，是一个开展兴无灭资的斗争问题。
    会议指出，增产节约一定要依靠群众，大搞群众运动。不能只靠少数人关门算账，冷冷清清。这是能不能搞好增产
  节约运动的关键问题。所有企业都要放手发动群众，千方百计增加产品品种和数量，提高产品质量，节约原材料和燃料，降低成本，提高劳动生产率。全体职工都要精打细算，把能够节省的每一分钱、每一斤煤、每一度电、每一滴油、每一寸钢材和木材，都节省下来，用到国家建设最急需的地方去。
    会议要求各个企业都根据自己的具体情况，确定增产节约的重点。凡是国家建设和人民生活需要、原材料又有保证的产品，都应当充分利用原材料，大力增加生产；原材料有困难的，要努力节约原材料，积极采用代用材料，开辟新的材料来源；产品销路有限制的，要努力提高质量，试制新产品。基本建设单位，必须贯彻执行技术坚持高标准、生活设施坚持低标准的原则；就是生产性的建筑，也要从实际出发，反对大手大脚，反对片面地求大、求全、求洋、求新。会议要求各省区、各部门、各企业都制订增产节约计划，提出具体要求，使广大职工有明确的奋斗目标，并且经常检查。
    会议认为西北地区的社会主义建设，已面临着新的高潮。各级领导一定要站在生产建设高潮的前面，充分认识广大群众的革命积极性，充分估计生产的潜力，克服认识落后于形势，领导落后于群众的现象。各地区、各部门、各企业，对工作都要有全盘规划和具体部署，突出重点，落实措施。各级领导都要深入实际，坚持蹲点，加强调查研究，及时总结经验；都要做冷静的促进派，密切注意群众运动的动向，及时发现问题，及时解决问题；珍惜群众的热情，关心群众的生活，注意劳逸结合。
    这次会议推选出西北工业交通战线上的二十面红旗，号召全区职工学习他们的榜样。（附图片）
