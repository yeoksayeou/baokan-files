    Mao Zedong Thought is the Source of the Working Class's Strength
    ——Experiences in Creating and Inventing the 63-101 Type Electric Ramming Machine
    Woodworker, Guangdong Province Third Construction Engineering Company　Huang Huating
    The 63-101 type ramming machine is a product of our struggle in technical innovation and technical revolution, guided by the brilliant thought of Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." In the ten years of creating and inventing the ramming machine, we have deeply realized that listening to Chairman Mao's words, reading Chairman Mao's books, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions are the sources of infinite wisdom for our working class, the power to overcome difficulties and achieve something.
          The Birth of Drawing No. 104
    I am not an engineer, not a mechanical worker, nor a ramming worker, but only a woodworker who has read a few months of books. So, how did I think of creating a ramming machine? This must be said from the beginning.
    Ramming walls is the most cumbersome type of work in construction projects in the Chaoshan area. Its scope of use is very wide, accounting for about 80% of the entire construction project. The main advantages of ramming walls are: the raw material, shell-lime sand, can be obtained locally, the price is relatively low, the production process is simple, and the quality is good. Therefore, ramming walls currently play an important role in solving the problem of civil buildings, including housing for the vast number of farmers in rural areas. However, due to the very backward operation technology of manual ramming, a worker standing on the wall panel, holding a heavy wall hammer, works for eight hours, becomes exhausted, and can generally only ram about half a cubic meter. Therefore, the ramming wall process often lags behind the progress of the entire construction project. This creates a contradiction between the current production needs and the backward operation method of the ramming wall process and low production efficiency, which is extremely incompatible with the requirements of the high-speed development of socialist construction. Therefore, to give full play to the advantages of ramming walls and their role in socialist construction, it is necessary to reform the operation technology and implement a technical revolution.
    As early as 1953, a leading comrade asked me to create a machine for ramming walls. But I didn't dare to think that I could create such a machine. In 1954, I went to Beijing to visit the Anshan Iron and Steel technical reform exhibition, listened to many stories of invention and creation, and learned that many advanced figures were also ordinary workers, and some had only read a few years of books and had not graduated from primary school. I thought of what the leading comrade had said to me about creating a ramming machine, and my heart began to stir. When I passed through Wuhan on my way back, I visited the electric bricklaying machine, which gave me great inspiration. Since then, I began to design the ramming machine. But I was originally a woodworker, and I couldn't even draw. Plus, many people said that machine ramming was impossible. The Party committee had repeatedly "posted lists to recruit talents," but no one dared to accept the task. I didn't dare to do it publicly, so I secretly "practiced basic skills," learning to draw on the one hand and designing on the other. I kept drawing until 1957, and the house was full of drawings, but there wasn't a single one that could be shown to others, so I couldn't help but waver.
    In 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the Party called on the working class to liberate their minds, break superstitions, and engage in technical innovation. With the support of the Party committee, I continued to design the ramming machine. By this time, I had drawn more than seventy drawings. Because they were all "closed-door creations," divorced from reality, they were all scrapped. However, I was still determined to continue. At the same time, the lack of ramming workers and the tight schedule also put great pressure on me. Soon, the Propaganda Department of the Shantou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized advanced workers to study Chairman Mao's works. I took the problem of creating a ramming machine to study "On Practice." When I read the passage "If anyone wants to know anything, there is no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing," I felt as if Chairman Mao was standing in front of me, prescribing the right medicine to criticize my past error of “closed-door creation.” I also found that the main reason for the failure of many drawings in the past was that I did not understand the regularity of the ramming wall process. I accepted this criticism, and carrying my luggage, following Chairman Mao's teaching, with the purpose of finding the regularity of ramming from practice, I went to the Chaoyang Overseas Chinese Building construction site, which was under construction at that time, and lived and worked with the ramming workers. Sometimes I picked up a wall hammer like them and stood on the wall to ram the wall. The workers knew that we were going to study using machines to replace manual ramming, and everyone enthusiastically supported us. They talked about many characteristics of ramming operation. After this period of going deep into reality and deep into the masses, I summarized the two major characteristics and three major requirements of ramming walls. The two major characteristics are: 1. The operation site has extremely great limitations; 2. High-altitude operations must absolutely guarantee safety. The three major requirements are: 1. The stroke must be consistent; 2. Must overlap strokes by half; 3. The impact must be uniform and compact.
    These characteristics and requirements became the main basis for my subsequent design of the ramming machine. However, just touching these laws does not mean the end of the process of understanding. More importantly, it is necessary to use the laws that have been understood to guide practice, and further grasp these laws in practice to design the ramming machine. Therefore, after summarizing the two major characteristics and three major requirements of ramming walls, I concentrated the design of the ramming machine on three aspects: (1) the rammer's shape; (2) the rammer's hammering; (3) the rammer's movement.
    In practice, the rammer's shape is the key of the key. The reason why my past designs were unsuccessful and why I felt difficulty was that I had not found the way to solve this problem. In the past, I always thought that the "wall path" was only twenty centimeters wide, and if I wanted to use a machine to ram, I had to have power. Even if I used a 1.7-kilowatt motor, the width would exceed thirty centimeters. The motor couldn't fit on the "wall path," so there was no point in talking about machine ramming. When I grasped the regularity of ramming from participating in ramming labor, I initially solved the design of the shape. Because I thought that since people can stand on the wall panel to operate, not restricted by the "wall path," the ramming machine can naturally stand on the wall panel, just like a person's two feet. Installing four wheels on the ramming machine and using the wall panel as a track, wouldn't the machine be unrestricted by the "wall path," and with a track, wouldn't the machine be able to move on the wall? The movement of the ramming machine now is somewhat like a person, and the shape is somewhat like a small tractor, which is why. The problem of shape was solved in this way.
    The rammer's hammering is also a difficult obstacle. Since I wanted to create a ramming machine in 1954, I often went outside to visit, and I took every opportunity to study various hammers and draw various hammers. But this obstacle still couldn't be overcome. Because the hammer of the ramming machine is required to be separated from the body to ensure safety. If the hammer is not separated from the body, hammering will shake the body, making the machine jump on the wall panel like a toad, which cannot guarantee the safety of high-altitude operations. As for the belt hammer, although it can prevent the machine body from being shaken, it is not aligned, and it will swing when hammering. Other hammers such as impact shaft hammers and spring hammers are also unsuitable. The hammer of the ramming machine must also ensure that no matter what height the starting point is, the hammering stroke must be consistent. Otherwise, each time lime sand is added, and the wall is gradually rammed higher, the stroke will gradually become shorter. All these hammers considered above cannot meet this requirement of ramming walls. Later, when participating in labor in the carpentry group, I was inspired by the planing machine innovated by the group. Because the advancement of the wooden board is rolled over by two clamping roller wheels, I imagined changing the wooden board to vertical, installing a large hammer below, using roller wheels to roll the wooden board, and then automatically moving one of the two rollers away after the wooden board is rolled up, and the wooden board will automatically fall down. Because the number of revolutions of the roller is the same at any time, the stroke of the wooden board being rolled up is also the same, and the hammering stroke is consistent. In this way, it can not only ensure that the machine body is not shaken during hammering, but also ensure that the hammering stroke is consistent at any time.
    In order to solve the problem of the rammer's movement, I studied the principles of operation of cars, motorcycles, tricycles, bicycles, tractors ..., and later watched the principles of operation of lathes and planers, but there were no results. According to the characteristics of ramming walls, the rammer's movement must be: (1) the machine cannot move continuously, it must run for a while and stop for a while. If it keeps running, the hammer will be dragged in the middle of the wall panel, the machine will be damaged, and the hammering will be weak; (2) to ensure that each hammer overlaps the previous one by half, forming a fish-scale-like rammed surface, the distance of each movement cannot exceed the width of the hammer, eight centimeters, and it must be guaranteed to stop and ram, drop the hammer when stopping, and raise the hammer when running. In this way, the stable forward movement of the machine can be guaranteed, safety can be guaranteed, one hammer can overlap the previous one by half, hammering is powerful, and the hammer does not pull the wall. In order to solve this problem, we did dozens of experiments, made many assumptions, and consulted many relevant personnel. This involved repeated practice, and finally we were inspired by the principle of the ratchet wheel of the mobile crane, which solved the problem.
    The practice of this stage proves that if people do not strive to make their thinking suitable for the regularity of the outside world, they will never be able to make their work achieve the expected results. Under the guidance of the thought of "On Practice," I persisted in going to reality and to the masses, and initially summarized the characteristics and requirements of ramming walls, overcame the subjectivist error of closed-door creation, and after one hundred and three failures, I drew the 104th drawing, found the knack for creating the ramming machine, and designed the ramming machine.
        The Soul of the Technical Revolution
    The development process of things is always full of struggle. In the process of technical innovation and technical revolution, there are not only struggles in scientific experiments, but also struggles in the ideological field. As far as my personal thinking is concerned, almost from the day I determined to create the ramming machine, there were two kinds of thinking in struggle. One is: the working class's revolutionary sense of responsibility, which prompted me to make great ambitions, and I would never give up until I created the ramming machine; the other is, I always felt that an ordinary woodworker like me who had only read seven months of books and never touched a machine, could break through this barrier? Especially when encountering difficulties, I couldn't help but hesitate. The struggle between these two kinds of thinking is sometimes very fierce. In fact, only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the support of the Party committee and the masses, did I truly establish the working class's great ambitions, and have the strength to break through these difficult barriers one by one.
    In May 1959, I drew the 104th drawing, and made the model of the ramming machine on July 1 of the same year. At this time, another sharp ideological struggle unfolded. The ramming machine model and drawings were sent to the company's Party committee and the manager's office, and received the support and encouragement of the Party and administrative leaders. At that time, most engineering and technical personnel enthusiastically supported our invention and creation, and expressed their agreement to try out the ramming machine. However, a few engineering and technical personnel, starting from the individualistic thinking of the bourgeoisie, were unwilling to admit the invention and creation of the workers, and repeatedly opposed the trial production. After a fierce debate, he finally reluctantly agreed to the trial production.
    With the strong support of the Party organization, the worker comrades worked hard for two months and finally made the first ramming machine.
    The creation of the ramming machine was basically successful. At this time, the provincial Party committee sent a congratulatory telegram, the municipal Party committee sent a congratulatory letter, and several newspapers and periodicals across the country published reports and photos. Brother units across the country also sent letters of congratulations, and some units also requested orders. Under these circumstances, some people thought that they had completed their historical task, and the future development was someone else's business, and advised me to rest. In the face of these arguments, I also felt that some words were not to my taste, but my mind was really a bit dizzy. At this time, I re-read Chairman Mao's works, and read the following passage in "On Practice": "The changing movement of the objective real world never ends, and people's understanding of the truth in practice never ends." I also read: "Knowledge starts from practice, and after practice, theoretical knowledge is obtained, it must return to practice again. The active role of knowledge is not only manifested in the active leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, but more importantly, it must be manifested in the leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice." Reviewing Chairman Mao's words, I became more sober and realized that these arguments were wrong. Why was I able to create the ramming machine? It was the Party and Chairman Mao who taught me. Now it is only in trial production at the industrial college construction site, and it is not known whether large-scale production can adapt. How can it be said that the historical task has been completed? Even if the ramming machine can withstand the test in production practice and be promoted, we cannot be complacent because of this little achievement. If we say that this completes the historical task, wouldn't we be lying on our laurels and unable to move forward again! How can this be considered listening to Chairman Mao's words and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions? Thinking about it this way, my mind calmed down, and I realized that getting honors is not the goal, but realizing communism is the ultimate goal of our communists.
    In this series of ideological struggles, I have particularly deeply realized that to have a technical revolution, we must first have an ideological revolution, and to have an ideological revolution, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the soul of the technical revolution.
        We are Still in Continuous Revolution
    Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of "On Practice," we established a mechanical ramming team, and in the autumn of 1961, we took the machines to the construction site of the Dananshan Overseas Chinese Farm to actually construct, and tested the newly born ramming machine in practice. On the first day of construction, five out of six machines broke down. At that time, the construction period was very tight, and individual technical cadres at the construction site were very picky, saying that machine ramming "coughed more than sang songs." At this critical moment, it was still the power of Mao Zedong Thought that made me persevere. Chairman Mao wrote in "On Practice": "After people have experienced failure, they also learn lessons from failure and correct their thinking to make it suitable for the regularity of the outside world, and people can turn failure into victory." With this kind of thinking, I understood the truth that "failure is the mother of success." On the one hand, I strived for the support of the cadres, and on the other hand, I encouraged the workers of the machine ramming team with Chairman Mao's thought, explaining that the technical revolution must have complex and tortuous struggles, and explaining that even if we fail now, finding the reasons for the failure is also an achievement, which strengthened the confidence of the comrades in the machine ramming team; at the same time, I grasped production with one hand. In order to complete the engineering task, when the machine was broken during the day, I rushed to repair and ram at night to make up for the loss of the project. Through this construction, we not only completed the entire project task seven days ahead of schedule, but more importantly, we affirmed that using machines to ram walls is good, and also summarized the shortcomings of the trial-produced ramming machine: clumsy, heavy, rough, and expensive. Clumsy means the machine body is too large; heavy means each machine weighs more than two hundred kilograms, and cranes are needed to move them up and down the wall panel; rough means the theoretical analysis was still insufficient when designing, and the lathe gears were used, and plus improper operation, they often broke; expensive means the cost of each machine is very high, which affects future promotion.
    After returning from the construction, I put forward the slogan of clever, light, precise, and cheap according to the new contradictions discovered in the practice on the construction site, and launched a tit-for-tat struggle with the shortcomings of the machine. This struggle was sharp. Because changing from clumsy, heavy, rough, and expensive to clever, light, precise, and cheap requires solving a lot of contradictions, especially in solving the problem of weight, it is even more difficult. At this difficult moment, I again connected this problem to study Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao said: "When studying any process, if there is a complex process with more than two contradictions, we must do our best to find its main contradiction. If we grasp this main contradiction, all problems will be solved." Chairman Mao pointed out the solution to me, but how to grasp this main contradiction? I thought, the machine body is so big and so heavy, besides the motor and the rammer hammer can not be made lighter, there is only the motor speed problem. The motor is high-speed, and the rammer's clamping wheel is low-speed. To reduce the motor's revolutions by dozens of times, we have to use large wheels to cover small wheels, one set after another. There are many gears, and there are also many parts such as the axis. If the machine body cannot be installed, we have to use chains to pull it to the back of the seat. If the machine body is large, the machine seat and the shell will also be larger. I analyzed this step by step and searched step by step. Finally, I found that weight is the main contradiction, and weight comes from the transmission system. After grasping the main contradiction, I consulted the workers and consulted books, and found a solution. After this main contradiction was solved, other problems were not difficult to solve. By 1963, I drew new drawings and changed the dozens of gears and machine parts in the past transmission system to only a few. In this way, there are fewer gears and fewer bearings, the machine base is smaller, and the shell is smaller, achieving clever, light, precise, and cheap. Because it is precise, the machine is more durable; because it is clever, the machine body is smaller, so the machine weight is also lighter, from the original 226 kilograms to 115 kilograms, and the volume is also reduced by one-third compared to the past; and it is also cheaper, and the cost of each machine is only about half of the original. It should be said that the real success of the ramming machine was still on October 1, 1963. Therefore, the ramming machine was named 63-101 type. The machine has undergone preliminary scientific appraisal, and the effect is very good.
    When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions appear, and contradictions are constantly generated. Now, the new contradiction we are encountering is the renovation of the entire process brought about by the ramming machine. As the ramming workers said, we have a ramming machine, but the entire process is "wearing a Western suit with a bamboo hat." In order to complete the supporting equipment, we are still constantly revolutionizing and constantly solving contradictions.
    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Party committee and the support of the vast number of employees and the assistance of technical personnel, we have now truly liberated the ramming worker brothers from heavy physical labor. We must also continue to practice and continue to revolutionize. I have done and learned very little, and there is nothing to be proud of and complacent about. I will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, guard against arrogance and rashness, study hard, and continue to move forward. I must engage in revolution for a lifetime and study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime.

    毛泽东思想是工人阶级力量的源泉
    ——创造发明63—101型电动夯墙机的体会
    广东省第三建筑工程公司木工　黄华庭
    63—101型夯墙机，是我们在技术革新和技术革命斗争中，在毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》光辉思想的指导下的产物。在创造发明夯墙机的十年过程中，我们特别深刻地体会到听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，照毛主席的指示办事，是我们工人阶级获得无穷智慧、获得战胜困难、有所作为的力量的源泉。
          104号图纸的诞生
    我不是工程师，不是机械工人，也不是夯墙工人，而只是一个读了几个月书的木工。那么，我是怎样想起要创造夯墙机来呢？这得从头说起。
    夯墙是潮汕地区建筑工程中最笨重的一个工种。它的使用范围很广，占整个建筑工程量的百分之八十左右。夯墙的主要优点是：所用的贝灰砂这种原材料，可以就地取材，价格较为低廉，生产工艺简单，质量较好。因此，夯墙在当前为解决民用建筑、包括农村广大农民的住房问题方面，是具有重要作用的。但是，由于人工夯墙的操作技术非常落后，一个工人站在墙板上，持着笨重的墙槌，工作八个小时，弄得精疲力竭，一般只能夯半立方左右。因此夯墙工序常常拖着整个建筑工程进度的后腿。这就存在着当前生产的需要和夯墙工序操作方法落后、生产效率很低的矛盾，与社会主义建设高速度发展的要求极不适应，所以要充分发挥夯墙的优越性和在社会主义建设中的作用，必须改革操作技术，实行技术革命。
    还在一九五三年，一位领导同志就要我创造出一部夯墙的机器来。可是我却不敢想到由我来创造这种机器。等到了一九五四年，我到北京参观鞍钢技术改革展览会，听了许多创造发明的故事，并知道许多先进人物也都是普通工人，有的也只读过几年书，小学还没有毕业。我想起那位领导同志对我说过的创造夯墙机的事情，心开始动起来。回来时路过武汉，又参观了电动砌砖机，得到了很大的启发，从此我就开始进行夯墙机的设计。可是我原是个木工，连图都不会画，加上许多人都说，机器夯墙是办不到的，党委连年“出榜招贤”，也都没人敢来接受这个任务。我就不敢公开的搞，只在暗地里“练基本功”，一方面学画图，一方面进行设计。一直画到一九五七年，房子里堆满了图纸，可就是没有一张可以见人，不免动摇起来。
    在一九五八年大跃进的形势下，党号召工人阶级解放思想，破除迷信，大搞技术革新。在党委的支持下，我又继续进行夯墙机的设计工作。到这时，一共画了七十多张图纸。因为都是“闭门造车”，脱离实际，全都报废了。但是，我还是决心干下去。同时，由于夯墙工的缺乏，任务又紧，也给了我巨大的压力。不久，中共汕头市委宣传部组织先进工人学习毛主席的著作。我就带着解决创造夯墙机的问题去学习《实践论》。当我读到“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的”这一段话时，感到好象毛主席站在我的面前，对症下药地批评我过去
  “闭门造车”的错误。我还发现过去画了许多图纸都失败，主要的原因正是自己还不懂得夯墙工序的规律性。我接受这个批评，就背起包袱，按照毛主席的教导，怀着从实践中去找寻夯墙的规律性的目的，到当时正在施工的潮阳华侨大厦工地去，和夯墙工人一起生活，一起劳动，有时和他们一样拿起墙槌，站在墙头夯墙。工人知道我们要研究用机器代替人工夯墙，大家热情支持。他们讲了许多夯墙操作的特点，经过这段时间的深入实际、深入群众之后，我总结出夯墙的两大特点和三大要求。两大特点是：一、操作场地有极大的限制；二、高空作业要绝对保证安全。三大要求是：一、冲程必须一致；二、必须一槌压半槌；三、冲击必须均匀密实。
    这些特点和要求，就成为我以后设计夯墙机的主要依据。不过，只是摸到了这些规律，认识的过程还没有完结，更重要的是要运用已经认识了的规律去指导实践，并在实践中进一步掌握这些规律来进行夯墙机的设计。因此，我在总结了夯墙的两大特点和三大要求之后，就把夯墙机的设计问题集中在三个方面：（一）夯机造型问题；（二）夯机锤击问题；（三）夯机移行问题。
    在实践中，夯机造型是关键中的关键。我过去的设计所以一事无成，所以感到困难，也就是这个造型问题没有摸到门路。过去老是想着“墙路”只有二十厘米宽，而要用机器夯，就得有动力，即使是用一点七瓩的马达，宽度也超过三十厘米，“墙路”放不下马达，也就谈不到机器夯墙了。当我从参加夯墙劳动的实践中摸到了夯墙的规律之后，便初步解决了造型的设计了。因为我想人既然可以站在墙板上操作，不受“墙路”的限制，夯墙机自然也可以站在墙板上，就象人的两只脚那样，给夯机装四个轮子，利用墙板作为轨道，岂不是机器就可以不受“墙路”的限制，而且有了轨道，机器不就可以在墙上移行了吗？现在制成的夯墙机的动作有点象人，造型有点象小拖拉机的样子，就是这个缘故。造型的问题就这样解决了。
    夯机锤击，也是一道难关。自一九五四年想创造夯墙机以后，我常常到外面参观，一有机会就研究各种各样的锤，画各种各样的锤。但这道关还是闯不过去。因为夯墙机的锤要求夯下去要与机身脱离关系，才能保证安全。如果锤不与机身分开，夯下去就要震动机身，使机器象蛤蟆一样在墙板上跳，就不能保证高空作业的安全。至于皮带锤虽然可以使机身不受震动，但没有管正，夯下去要摆动。其他象击轴锤、弹簧锤等等也都不合用。夯墙机的锤还要保证不论起点在什么高度，夯下去冲程要一致，不然每次加灰砂，墙渐渐夯高起来，冲程就要渐渐变短。以上考虑过的所有这些锤都不能适应夯墙的这一要求。后来还是在木工小组参加劳动时，看到组里革新的刨板机，受到了启发。因为木板的推进是由两个相夹的滚筒轮卷过去的，我设想把木板改为直竖，下面装上大锤，用滚筒轮卷动木板，再在木板被卷上去之后，两个滚筒自动移开一个，木板就自动落下来了，因为滚筒在任何时候转数都一样，木板被卷上去的行程也一样，夯下去的冲程就一致了。这样，既可以保证夯击时不震动机身，也保证了任何时候夯击的冲程一致。
    为了解决夯机移行这个问题，我研究了汽车、摩托车、三轮车、脚踏车、拖拉机……，后来还看了车床、刨床等机械运转的原理，都没有结果。按照夯墙的特点，夯机的移行必须是：（一）机器不能连续移动，必须跑一下，停一下，一直跑，锤夯下去就要在墙板中间拖着，机器就要损坏，锤击也就无力；（二）要保证一锤压半锤，形成鱼鳞状的夯面，每次移动的距离就不能超过锤的宽度八厘米，而必须保证一停一夯，停时落锤，跑时起锤。这样，才能保证机器的稳定前进，保证安全，达到一锤压半锤，夯击有力，锤不拉墙。为了解决这一问题，我们做过几十次试验，做了好多设想，请教了好多有关人员。这中间经过多次的反复实践，最后才从活动吊车的棘轮的原理得到启发，解决了这个问题。
    这个阶段的实践证明，人们如果不努力使自己的思想适合于外界的规律性，是休想使工作能得到预想的结果的。我就是在《实践论》的思想指导下，坚持到实际中去，到群众中去，才初步总结出夯墙的特点和要求，克服了闭门造车的主观主义错误，经过了一百零三次的失败，才画出了第104号图纸，摸到了夯墙机创制的窍门，设计出夯墙机来。
        技　术　革　命　的　灵　魂
    事物的发展过程，总是充满着斗争的。在技术革新、技术革命的过程中，既有科学实验的斗争，也有思想领域上的斗争。就我个人的思想来说，几乎是从立志要创造夯墙机那一天开始，就有两种思想在斗争。一种是：工人阶级的革命责任感，促使我立下雄心壮志，不创造出夯墙机，誓不罢休；另一种是，总觉得象我这样一个只读过七个月书、从来没有摸过机器的普通木工，能够闯过这道关吗？特别是碰到困难的时候，心里就不免犹豫起来。这两种思想的斗争，有时还是很剧烈的。实在说来，只是靠着毛泽东思想，靠着党委和群众的支持，我才真正树立起工人阶级的雄心壮志，才有力量闯过这一道一道的难关。
    一九五九年五月，我画出了第104号图纸，同年七月一日才做成了夯墙机的模型。就在这时，又展开了另一场尖锐的思想斗争。夯墙机模型和图纸送到了公司的党委会和经理室，受到了党和行政领导的支持和鼓励。当时，大多数工程技术人员都热情支持我们的创造发明，表示同意试制夯墙机。但也有个别工程技术人员，从资产阶级的个人主义思想出发，不愿意承认工人的发明创造，再三反对试制，经过了一场激烈的辩论，最后他才算勉强同意试制。
    在党组织的大力支持下，工人同志苦战了两个月，终于把第一部夯墙机制造出来了。
    夯墙机的创造基本成功了，这时，省委拍来了贺电，市委送来了贺信，全国好几种报纸和刊物发表了报道，登了照片，全国各兄弟单位也纷纷来信祝贺，有的单位还要求定货。在这种情况下，有些人认为已经完成了历史任务，以后的发展是别人的事了，劝我休息。在这些议论面前，我也觉得有些话不是味道，但头脑也真的有点昏昏然。这时候我又重读毛主席的著作，在《实践论》中读到这样一段话：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”又读到：“认识从实践始，经过实践得到了理论的认识，还须再回到实践去。认识的能动作用，不但表现于从感性的认识到理性的认识之能动的飞跃，更重要的还须表现于从理性的认识到革命的实践这一个飞跃。”重温毛主席的话，我更加清醒了，认识到这些议论都是错误的。我为什么能创造出夯墙机来？是党和毛主席教导的，现在只在工专建筑工地试产，大规模生产能不能适应还不知道，怎么就能说完成了历史任务？即使夯墙机在生产实践中经得起考验，推广开去了，也不能因为这一点成就，就自满自足起来。如果说这样就完成了历史任务，岂不是就会躺在荣誉上面，再也不能前进了么！这怎么能算是听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事？这么一想，头脑也就冷静了，认识到得了荣誉并不是目的，实现共产主义才是我们共产党人的最终目的。
    在这一系列的思想斗争中，也就特别深刻体会到要技术革命，必须先有思想革命，要思想革命，就要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。这是技术革命的灵魂。
        我们还在不断革命中
    在毛主席《实践论》的思想指导下，我们建立了一个机械夯墙队，一九六一年秋天带着机器到大南山华侨农场工地去实际施工，在实践中检验这刚刚出世的夯墙机。施工第一天，六部机器就搞坏了五部。当时工期很紧，工地个别技术干部就大挑毛病，说机器夯墙“咳嗽多过唱曲”。在这紧要关头，还是毛主席思想的力量使我坚持下来。毛主席在《实践论》中写道：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利”，有了这种思想，我就懂得“失败者成功之母”的道理。我一方面争取干部的支持，一方面以毛主席的思想鼓励机夯队的工人，说明技术革命必定有复杂曲折的斗争，说明我们现在即使失败了，能找出失败的原因，也就是成绩，坚定了机夯队同志的信心；同时又一手抓生产，为了完成工程任务，白天机器坏了，夜里赶修赶夯，以弥补工程的损失。通过这场施工，我们不仅提前七天完成整个工程任务，更重要的是肯定用机器夯墙是好的，也总结出试制的夯墙机的缺点：笨、重、粗、贵。笨就是机身太大；重就是每部机重二百多公斤，上下墙板要用起重机；粗是设计时理论分析还不足，用的是车床牙轮，加上操作不善，常要碰坏；贵是每部机的造价很高，影响将来推广。
    施工回来，我就根据工地再实践中发现的新矛盾，提出了巧、轻、精、廉，与机器的缺点展开针锋相对的斗争。这斗争是尖锐的。因为从笨、重、粗、贵变为巧、轻、精、廉，要解决一大堆矛盾，特别是在解决重的问题上，更加困难。在这困难的时刻，我又联系着这个问题去学习毛主席的《矛盾论》。毛主席说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”毛主席给我指出了解决的办法啦，但要如何抓住这个主要矛盾呢？我想，机身这样大，这样重，除了马达和夯锤不能改轻之外，就剩下马达的转数问题了。马达是高速的，夯锤的夹轮是低速的，要把马达的转数变小几十倍，就不得不大轮套小轮，一个套一个，齿轮多，轴心等零件也就多，机身装不下，就不得不用链拉到座后。机身大，机座和外壳也就随着大了。我这样一步一步的分析，一步一步的追寻。终于发现了重是主要矛盾，而重又是从变速系统来的。主要矛盾抓住了，我就请教工人，请教书本，找到了解决办法。这个主要矛盾解决了，其他问题也就不难解决了。到一九六三年，我就画出新的图纸来，把过去变速系统中的几十个齿轮和机件改变成只有几个。这样，齿轮少，轴承也少，机座小，外壳也小，达到了巧、轻、精、廉。因为精了，机器更耐用；因为巧了，机身就小了，这样机重也就轻了，从原来的二百二十六公斤，减轻为一百一十五公斤，体积也比过去的缩小了三分之一；而且也便宜了，每部机的造价才相当于原来的一半左右。应当说，夯墙机的真正成功还是在一九六三年的十月一日，因此，夯墙机也就命名为63—101型。机器经过初步科学鉴定，效果很好。
    旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现，矛盾总是不断产生的。现在，我们碰到的新矛盾是夯墙机带来的整个工序的革新问题，正如夯墙工人说的，我们有了夯墙机，但整个工序却是“穿西装，戴竹笠。”为了使配套设备完整起来，我们现在还在不断革命，不断解决矛盾之中。
    在毛泽东思想的指引下，在党委的领导和广大职工的支持以及技术人员的协助下，现在真正使夯墙工人兄弟从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来了。我们还必须不断实践，不断革命。我做的和学的都很少，更没有什么可骄傲自满。我一定永远听毛主席的话，戒骄戒躁，努力学习，继续前进。我一定要干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作。
