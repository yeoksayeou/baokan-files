    Rather Endure Hardship Myself Than Let the Masses Be Inconvenienced Even for a Moment
    Fan Yongming, Person in Charge of the Dongtiangezhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Miyun County
    Wang Fushan in the film always puts the interests of the masses first, doing both big and small business well. Whether it’s a nine-fen box of adhesive plasters, or a fen's worth of vinegar, or a few fen's worth of sewing needles, he does it all with seriousness and dedication. His spirit of service reflects a new ethos of a socialist commercial worker sharing joy and sorrow with the masses, fully embodying the mass line that the Party has repeatedly taught.
    Thinking of our supply and marketing cooperative, in the past we were reluctant to do small business, so we could not fully meet the needs of the masses. After seeing the film, my thinking became clearer. I realized that even though the business is small, it is a major matter related to the daily life of the people. Small business is needed for production, needed by the people, and thus needed by the revolution. In the future, I will be like Wang Fushan, "Rather endure hardship myself than let the masses be inconvenienced even for a moment," and establish the ideology of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    宁愿自己千辛万苦  不让群众一时为难
    密云县东田各庄供销店负责人  樊永明
    影片里的王福山，处处把群众的利益摆在第一位，大买卖做得好，小买卖也做得好。不论是九分钱一盒的橡皮膏，还是一分钱的醋，几分钱的缝衣针，他都是那么严肃认真地把它做好。他的这种服务精神，反映了一个社会主义商业人员同群众欢乐与共，休戚相关的新风尚，充分体现了党一再教导的群众观点。
    联系到我们供销店，过去遇到小买卖，就不大愿意做，所以就不能充分满足群众的需要。看了影片，思想更加明确了。我认识到，买卖虽小，却是关系到人民群众日常生活的大事。小买卖是生产需要的，是人民需要的，也就是革命需要的。今后，我要象王福山那样“宁愿自己千辛万苦，不让群众一时为难”，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。（附图片）
