    Brief Comments
    U.S. Vice President Humphrey boasted that his Far East trip was a "peace-seeking" visit.
    But where exactly did he go and to whom did he "seek peace"? It was to Sato's government in Japan, Park Chung-hee's clique in South Korea, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in Taiwan, and so on. In short, they are all accomplices and henchmen in the US war of aggression against Vietnam. This does not mean that Humphrey went to the wrong place, but only shows what kind of "peace" he is "seeking"?

    U.S. Senator Thurmond clamored that,
  "If there is no other way to win the Vietnam War," "the United States should use nuclear weapons."
    Former U.S. President Kennedy felt that nuclear weapons could not deal with the revolutionary wars of oppressed people, so he created a "flexible response strategy" and opened a "special war" "testing ground" in South Vietnam. Now that the "experiment" has failed, he wants to revive the old magic weapon. This is truly a case of "a desperate patient seeking any cure."

    The British magazine *The Economist* talks a lot about whether the US and Britain can "contain China" in 1966. But it expressed no confidence, saying: "This is the biggest unknown in the mid-sixties, and no one dares to bet on it."
    Willing to be an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in opposing China, but having no confidence in the prospect of opposing China, this is a common affliction of Britain and other U.S. partners. Not only that, but recently British newspapers have unanimously admitted that Britain's submission to the United States has resulted in it "sacrificing independence" and becoming a "vassal of the United States." This is a known quantity that does not require betting.

    三言两语
    美国副总统汉弗莱把他的远东之行吹嘘为“寻求和平”的访问。
    可是他究竟到什么地方去向什么人“寻求和平”呢？那就是日本的佐藤政府，南朝鲜的朴正熙集团，台湾的蒋介石匪帮等等，总而言之，都是美国侵越战争的帮凶和打手。这倒不是说明汉弗莱走错了地方，而只能说明他所“寻求”的究竟是什么样的“和平”？

    美国参议员瑟蒙德叫嚣说，
  “如果没有其他办法打赢越南战争”，“美国就应当使用核武器”。
    前美国总统肯尼迪因为感到核武器对付不了被压迫人民的革命战争，才搞了一个什么“灵活反应战略”，在南越开辟了“特种战争”的“试验场”。现在“试验”失败，又想祭起原来的破法宝，这真正是所谓“病急乱投医”。

    英国《经济学家》周刊大谈在一九六六年美英能不能“遏制中国”。但它表示没有信心，说：“这是六十年代中最大的未知数，还没有人敢对此打赌”。
    甘当美帝反华的帮凶，但又对反华的前景毫无信心，这正是英国和其他美国合伙者共有的苦恼。不仅如此，最近英国报刊一致承认英国屈从美国的结果，使它“牺牲了独立”，成了“美国的附庸”。这倒是一个无须打赌的已知数了。
