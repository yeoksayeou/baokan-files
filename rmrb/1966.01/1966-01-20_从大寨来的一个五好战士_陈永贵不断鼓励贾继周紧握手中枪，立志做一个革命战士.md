    A Five-Good Soldier from Dazhai
    Chen Yonggui Constantly Encourages Jia Jizhou to Firmly Grasp His Gun, Vowing to Become a Revolutionary Soldier
    In the "Heroic Eighth Company" of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Jia Jizhou, a soldier from Dazhai Brigade, Dazhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, was once again named a "Five-Good" soldier at the end of the year. He spoke of how Comrade Chen Yonggui used a revolutionary standard of cherishing the motherland and having the world in view to help him progress.
    Jia Jizhou enlisted in the army in the spring of 1964. Even before he enlisted, Comrade Chen Yonggui, amidst his busy schedule, made time specifically to help him correct his attitude toward joining the army, repeatedly instructing him to diligently study Chairman Mao's works after arriving at the unit, to diligently practice skills in killing the enemy, and to always remember that he was a youth from Dazhai. The people of Dazhai farm for the revolution at home, and when enlisting in the army, they must do everything for the revolution...
    After Jia Jizhou joined the army, Comrade Chen Yonggui often took advantage of business trips passing through the unit's station, or when the unit went to Dazhai for camping, to visit the company five or six times. He would call Jia Jizhou to his side, asking about everything from studying Chairman Mao's works and mastering military technology to relationships with comrades. If he discovered problems, he would point them out on the spot, helping him to improve his understanding. If he encountered difficulties, he would help him think of solutions and offer advice.
    In the autumn of 1964, the unit was practicing military skills, and Jia Jizhou encountered some difficulties in grenade throwing. At this time, Comrade Chen Yonggui, who was attending a meeting in a certain unit near the unit's station, called him to his side one evening. He used the method of recalling how the people of Dazhai fought the Wolf Den Ridge four times in those years, earnestly encouraging him to not be afraid of difficulties, to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings in the article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and to advance in the face of difficulties.
    In the spring of 1965, the unit went to Dazhai for camping. Taking this opportunity, Comrade Chen Yonggui repeatedly made detailed inquiries about Jia Jizhou's situation in the unit and had him report to all the commune members of Dazhai Brigade at a commune members' meeting. In these several conversations, Comrade Chen Yonggui also conducted education for Jia Jizhou on cherishing the motherland, having the world in view, firmly grasping the gun in his hand, and vowing to become a true revolutionary soldier, starting from discussing the current situation in Vietnam and the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism.
    Under the influence of the revolutionary melting pot of the People's Liberation Army, coupled with Comrade Chen Yonggui's kind concern and careful teaching, Jia Jizhou made rapid progress in the "Heroic Eighth Company." In military training, especially when learning to swim, he always remembered Comrade Chen Yonggui's instructions about cherishing the motherland and having the world in view, constantly using the needs of the Vietnamese people as a whip to spur himself on. Sometimes, if he relaxed even a little, he would quickly think about it and strictly demand of himself, so he would immediately be full of vigor again. Finally, he transformed from a "landlubber" into a蛟龙jiao long (a mythical dragon symbolizing courage and skill) who dared to venture into rivers and seas.
    Now, in the "Heroic Eighth Company," whenever the progress of Jia Jizhou after joining the army is discussed, not only does Jia Jizhou himself sincerely thank Comrade Chen Yonggui for his concern and help, but all the other comrades in the company also deeply feel that the revolutionary style of the people of Dazhai is not only reflected in production, but is also equally radiant in the way they treat the growth of their enlisted children.

    从大寨来的一个五好战士
    陈永贵不断鼓励贾继周紧握手中枪，立志做一个革命战士
    在中国人民解放军某部“英雄八连”，来自山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队的战士贾继周，在年终再次被评为“五好”战士。他曾谈到陈永贵同志怎样用胸怀祖国、放眼世界的革命标准，帮助自己进步的。
    贾继周是一九六四年春应征入伍的。早在他应征入伍之前，陈永贵同志就在百忙中，专门抽出时间，帮助他端正入伍态度，再三地嘱咐他，到部队后要努力学习毛主席著作，苦练杀敌本领，要时刻记住自己是来自大寨的青年，大寨人在家种田为革命，参军当兵更要事事处处为革命……。
    贾继周入伍到了部队，陈永贵同志又经常利用外出工作路过部队驻地，或部队到大寨野营的机会，先后五六次到连队，把贾继周叫到自己的身边，从学习毛主席著作，掌握军事技术，一直询问到同志关系等等。发现问题就当场指出，帮助他提高认识，有了困难就帮他想办法，出主意。
    一九六四年秋天，部队正在大练军事技术，贾继周在练投弹上遇到了一些困难。正在这时，在部队驻地附近某单位开会的陈永贵同志，在一个晚上把他叫到了自己的身边，用通过回忆大寨人当年四战狼窝掌的办法，语重心长地鼓励他要不怕困难，要牢记毛主席在《愚公移山》一文中的教导，要迎着困难前进。
    一九六五年春，部队到大寨野营，趁此机会，陈永贵同志又三番五次地对贾继周在部队中的情况，作了详尽的了解，并让他在社员大会上向大寨大队的全体社员作了汇报。在这几次谈话中，陈永贵同志还从谈论当前越南局势，美帝国主义的侵略野心等入手，对贾继周进行了胸怀祖国，放眼世界，紧握手中枪，立志做一个名副其实的革命战士的教育。
    在解放军革命大熔炉的熏陶下，加上陈永贵同志的亲切关怀和细心教导，贾继周在“英雄八连”里，的确进步飞快。在军事训练中，特别在学游泳时，他时刻记住陈永贵同志关于既要胸怀祖国、又要放眼世界的嘱咐，经常把越南人民的需要，作为鞭策自己努力再努力的鞭子。有时稍有一点松劲，就赶快想一想，严格要求自己，这样他又立即干劲十足，终于从一个“旱鸭子”练成了一条敢闯江湖河海的蛟龙。
    现在，在“英雄八连”里，凡是谈论起贾继周到部队后的进步情形，不仅贾继周自己由衷地感谢陈永贵同志的关怀和帮助，全连的其他同志，也都深深感到，大寨人的革命风格，不仅表现在生产上，在对待自己参军子弟的成长上，也是一样的光彩夺目。
