    Investigation for the Revolution
    More Tasks Ahead
    Last July, six comrades and I accepted a field investigation and research assignment. This was a new task, very different from our past work in terms of requirements, content, and methods. Because we understood the principle of investigation for the revolution, no one complained, even with the heavy tasks and tight deadlines. We frequently studied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, seeking contradictions, finding solutions to contradictions, and discovering ways to overcome difficulties.
    After several months of hard work, we completed the fieldwork. We investigated 74 points in 18 counties, traveling more than 3,500 kilometers, initially clarifying the favorable and unfavorable conditions for construction in the area, and proposing directions for construction and development.
    To better provide reference materials and scientific arguments needed for leadership decisions, we divided the area into several zones based on the similarity of construction conditions and the consistency of development directions, and recommended several construction sites with better conditions.
    Although we have done some work, it is still far from the leadership's requirements. We are determined to exert even greater efforts in the new year and strive to better complete the investigation tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    Traversing Thousands of Mountains and Rivers
    When I first arrived at the investigation team, I had some individualistic ideas because I had not established the correct ideology of investigating for the revolution. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that my work was part of the revolutionary work.
    Once, I went from Lizhou to Langhuan, with the Anning River in between. Early in the morning, we arrived at the Anning River, but the ferry had not started operating, so we waded across. We safely crossed the first river, but the second river was difficult. After several attempts, I took off my clothes and prepared to swim across. The Anning River was not peaceful; the water was rapid, ice-cold, and piercing. When the water reached my chest, my muscles suddenly contracted, and I had to retreat. After several twists and turns, we finally crossed the river by boat, but all my clothes were soaked. When I arrived at the commune, I couldn't find a single cadre. I found out that the secretary was in the eighth team, which was nine miles away, so I decided to go find him, walking until I was sweating profusely, but I was out of luck. I ran more than fifty miles back and forth, tired and hungry. When I returned to the commune, I happened to run into the commune cadres, and I worked until late at night. The next morning, I ran more than thirty miles and continued to work until the evening.
    I set off again early on the third day. I felt unwell on the way, but after finishing my work at one spot, I felt a little better. However, the last mile or two were really hard to endure. At this time, I thought of the Red Army traversing thousands of mountains and rivers during the Long March, I thought that I was investigating for the revolution, I thought of Chairman Mao's kind teachings, and suddenly a surge of strength emerged, enabling me to persevere.

### 为革命而考察

    为革命而考察
    还有更多的任务
    去年七月，我和六个同志一起接受了一项野外考察研究的任务。这是一项新的工作，和我们过去的工作在要求、内容和方法上都有很大差别。在任务重、时间紧的情况下，因为我们都懂得了为革命而考察的道理，大家都从不叫苦叫累。我们经常带着问题学习毛主席著作，找矛盾，找解决矛盾的办法，找克服困难的办法。
    经过几个月的辛勤劳动，才结束了野外工作。我们共考察了十八个县七十四个点，行程三千五百多公里，初步摸清了这个地区建设的有利条件和不利条件，提出了建设发展的方向。
    为了更好地提供领导上决策所需要的参考资料和科学论证，我们根据建设条件的相似性，发展方向的一致性划分了若干地带，推荐了若干条件较好的建设地点。
    我们虽然做了些工作，但距领导上的要求相差还很远。我们有决心，在新的一年里，鼓足更大的干劲，争取更好地完成党所交给我们的考察任务。

    踏破万水千山
    初来考察队，由于没有树立正确的为革命而考察的思想，产生了一些个人主义的东西。学了毛主席著作，认识到自己的工作是革命工作的一部分。
    有一次，我从礼州到郎环，中间隔着安宁河。一早我们来到安宁河边，见渡船还未开始摆渡，我们便涉水。第一道河安全而过，第二道河可给难住了。试涉几次，最后我脱掉衣服，准备游泳过去。安宁河并不安宁，水急而寒冷刺骨，当水淹到我胸部时，肌肉猛然收缩，只好退回来。后来几经周折，总算乘船过了河，但衣服全给打湿了。赶到公社，一个干部也找不到。打听到书记在八队，还有九里路，我决意去找他，走得汗流浃背，不料又扑个空，前后跑了五十多里，又累又饿，回到公社正好碰到公社干部，一直工作到深夜。第二天一大早跑了三十多里路，又连续工作到晚上。
    第三天一早又赶路，途中身体感到不适，在一个点上搞完工作后，感觉轻松一些。可是最后一二里路实在难支持。此时，想起红军长征踏破万水千山，想到自己是为革命而考察，想到毛主席的亲切教导，不觉一股力量涌出来，使我坚持下来。
