    A new upsurge is forming in animal husbandry production in China's vast pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, China's animal husbandry production has been developing healthily and continuously. In the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Sichuan, and other regions, the number of livestock has increased several times or even several-fold in the more than ten years since liberation, and the quality has also greatly improved. Most pastoral areas have established people's communes or collective economies of cooperatives. The development of socialist animal husbandry has greatly changed the backward economic conditions in China's pastoral areas.
    The great development of animal husbandry production in pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas is the result of the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the result of the conscientious implementation of the Party's various guidelines and policies by Party committees at all levels. The socialist education movement currently underway in pastoral areas is the key to driving revolution, construction, and all other work in pastoral areas. Class struggle is effective when grasped, and this is equally true for pastoral areas. Our fundamental policy for building socialism in pastoral areas is to take class struggle as the key link, to take the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism as the key link, to grasp revolution, promote production, and promote construction. This means adhering to carrying the socialist education movement through to the end, giving full play to the superiority of the collective economy of the people's communes, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of herdsmen, vigorously developing socialist animal husbandry production, and building new socialist pastoral areas.
    With the deepening of the socialist education movement, animal husbandry production in pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas is currently experiencing a period of great development. The Party's leading organs must emphasize politics, and according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, correctly solve some problems in development. Taking the issue that the construction of grassland pastures cannot fully adapt to the increase in the number of livestock, there is the question of whether to treat pastoral area construction with a revolutionary development perspective or with a view of being content with the status quo and stagnating. Starting from the revolutionary development perspective, the so-called contradiction between many livestock and little grassland is essentially a problem of people's thinking, especially the revolutionization of leadership thinking. Livestock eat grass. How much grass there is determines how many livestock can be raised. Where does grass come from? Can we rely solely on the gifts of nature? No. We must rely on human strength to strive for it. As long as we take class struggle as the key link, rely on the strength of the socialist collective economy, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the herdsmen, liberate our minds, and build grasslands according to local conditions, there will be more grass, and livestock will definitely have greater and better development.
    One view is that when livestock develop to a certain level, the carrying capacity of the grassland becomes "saturated," and livestock can no longer develop. This view reflects certain objective realities. Because the natural grassland yield is indeed limited. However, more importantly, with human effort, grasslands can be built and the yield can be continuously improved. If we rely solely on natural grasslands to develop livestock without necessary construction, then livestock development will be limited. A certain yield of natural grassland can only feed a certain number of livestock. If the development of livestock exceeds the carrying capacity that natural grassland can bear, it is detrimental to the grassland and to the development of animal husbandry. Acknowledging such facts does not mean that, under the socialist system, the broad masses of herdsmen armed with Mao Zedong Thought are powerless to do anything about the grasslands. Natural grasslands can be improved through human construction. The Ikezhao League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had very poor pastures. Several years ago, some people said that livestock could not develop further once they reached four million head. Now the league's livestock has exceeded six million head and can continue to develop. This is a sandy dune grassland that suffered severe damage before liberation. After liberation, some shortcomings also occurred in practical work. However, from leaders to the masses, they accepted historical lessons, established a revolutionary development perspective, resolutely fought against unfavorable natural conditions, and carried out mass grassland construction, planting one million mu of grass in recent years, and livestock have greatly developed. The grasslands of the Ikezhao League are grasslands with very poor natural conditions, and they can develop livestock in large numbers, fully demonstrating that the saying that production has reached its peak and nothing can be done is unfounded.
    Can the animal husbandry economy in pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas rise steadily? This is a cognitive issue that needs to be resolved correctly. In the past, there was a saying that large ups and downs in animal husbandry were a law. This statement is only a reflection of unstable production in the old society. Generally speaking, most pastoral areas experience a major natural disaster every few years. In the old society—under the feudal, semi-feudal social system and the individual, scattered nomadic economy—herdsmen were unable to fight against natural disasters and could only suffer great losses in major disasters and small losses in minor disasters. Coupled with the massive plunder by the reactionary ruling class, the number of livestock inevitably continued to decline. For example, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from 1936 to 1946, the number of livestock decreased by two million head in ten years, an average annual decrease of two percent. After liberation, this situation fundamentally changed. The broad masses of people, relying on the strength of the collective economy of the people's communes, overcame and overcame various natural disasters. Many areas have not only been able to increase production in good years with favorable weather, but also have been able to achieve increased production after vigorously fighting disasters even in severe snowstorms or droughts. In the eighteen years since its establishment, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has continuously suffered severe natural disasters, including four years of particularly large disasters. However, with the exception of one year in which livestock decreased slightly, there were seventeen years of consecutive increases. Other pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas across the country are also gradually rising. Therefore, it is unfounded to say that our current animal husbandry is also a law of ups and downs. As long as we adhere to Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the strength of the collective economy of the people's communes, rely on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of herdsmen, and actively carry out construction, it is entirely possible to resist various natural disasters and steadily develop animal husbandry.
    Grasslands are limited, and grassland construction cannot be effective immediately, so the contradiction can only be resolved by reducing the number of livestock and improving quality. This is another saying. Under certain conditions, as a temporary measure, it is not impossible. It is completely correct to pay attention to improving the quality of livestock when developing livestock. The development of China's socialist construction and the improvement of people's lives require more large livestock, fine-wool sheep, and other improved breeds of livestock. Our development of animal husbandry is to greatly increase the number of livestock, continuously improve the quality of livestock, and provide the country with large quantities of high-quality draught animals, meat, milk, leather, wool, etc. Therefore, we must never pay attention to quantity alone and neglect quality. The problem is that developing the number of livestock requires building more and better grassland pastures; improving the quality of livestock also requires building more and better grassland pastures. Without certain material conditions, it is impossible to develop quantity or improve quality. Separating quantity and quality and reducing quantity to seek quality is a passive view and therefore cannot correctly handle the relationship between quantity and quality. The correct view should be to develop both the number of livestock and improve the quality of livestock. As long as it is handled properly, developing quantity and improving quality can promote each other. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made significant achievements in improving the number and quality of livestock. The region already has millions of improved livestock, and the number of livestock has also greatly developed. This is the best proof.
    The belief that livestock development has reached its peak, that the number of livestock cannot be increased further, and that grassland pastures are already "saturated" all have one thing in common: they fail to see the subjective initiative of the herdsmen in building grasslands. This is an old idea that lags behind objective reality. Now, the socialist collective economy in pastoral areas is developing and consolidating day by day, and the herdsmen's consciousness is improving as never before. We should firmly believe that the revolutionary herdsmen, under the leadership of the Party, will never be content to rely on nature to raise livestock and be slaves of nature, but will do everything possible to exert human power, tap potential, transform grasslands, and build grasslands. Many unutilized grasslands can be developed and expanded; grasslands that are not very good can be improved through construction; and good grasslands can be improved to increase grass yield. Although it is not possible to completely eliminate reliance on nature under the current conditions, it is possible to gradually increase human factors and reduce reliance on natural factors. In the eyes of revolutionary people, nature can be gradually transformed, and production must always move forward. This is a struggle for production and also a revolution in people's thinking.
    Whether grasslands can be built and whether livestock can be developed depends on the revolutionization of the thinking of leading organs and cadres. We must learn to build pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas with the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai and the revolutionary spirit of the Wushenzhao Commune in building pastoral areas through self-reliance. We must establish a revolutionary development perspective and correctly guide the work of pastoral area construction. When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Xilingol League was liberated, the number of livestock was 1.3 million head, and now it has grown to 9.2 million head. This fact tells us how great the results can be when we guide our work with a revolutionary development perspective. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In the realm of the struggle for production and scientific experiment, mankind is constantly developing, and nature is also constantly developing, and will never stop at one level. Therefore, mankind must constantly sum up experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and move forward. The point of view of stopping, the point of view of pessimism, the point of view of doing nothing, and the point of view of pride and complacency are all wrong." We should unreservedly apply Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings to the development of animal husbandry production and the construction of grasslands, and it will generate extremely great power for the construction of China's socialist pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas.

### 用革命的发展观点指导牧区生产

    用革命的发展观点指导牧区生产
    我国广大牧区和半农半牧区的畜牧业生产正在形成一个新高潮。在毛泽东思想指导下，我国畜牧业生产一直是健康地不断向前发展的。内蒙古、新疆、西藏、青海、甘肃、宁夏、四川等牧区，解放以来的十多年中，牲畜的数量成倍地或几倍地增加，质量也有很大提高。绝大部分牧区都已经建立了人民公社或合作社的集体经济。社会主义畜牧业的发展，大大改变了我国牧区落后的经济面貌。
    牧区和半农半牧区畜牧业生产的大发展，是党中央和毛泽东同志英明正确领导的结果，是各级党委认真贯彻执行党的各项方针政策的结果。牧区正在进行的社会主义教育运动，是带动牧区革命、建设和各项工作的纲。阶级斗争一抓就灵，对于牧区来说，同样是真理。我们在牧区建设社会主义的根本方针是以阶级斗争为纲，以社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争为纲，抓革命，促生产，促建设。这就是坚持把社会主义教育运动进行到底，充分发挥人民公社集体经济的优越性，充分调动广大牧民的积极性，大力发展社会主义的畜牧业生产，建设社会主义的新牧区。
    随着社会主义教育运动的深入开展，当前牧区、半农半牧区畜牧业生产正处在大发展形势中，党的领导机关必须突出政治，按照毛泽东同志的指示，正确解决发展中的某些问题。就以草牧场的建设不能完全适应牲畜头数增加的情况来说，就有一个是用革命的发展观点，还是用安于现状、停止不前的观点来对待牧区建设的问题。从革命的发展观点出发，所谓牲畜多和草原少的矛盾，实质上是人的思想问题，特别是领导思想革命化的问题。牲畜是吃草的。有多少草就能养多少牲畜。草是从哪里来的呢？能够仅仅依靠自然的恩赐吗？不能。我们必须依靠人的力量去争取。我们只要以阶级斗争为纲，依靠社会主义集体经济的力量，发扬牧民群众的革命精神，解放思想，因地制宜地建设草原，草就会多起来，牲畜一定可以有更大、更好的发展。
    有一种观点，认为牲畜发展到一定程度，草原的载畜量就“饱和”了，牲畜就不能再发展了。这种看法反映了某些客观情况。因为，天然草原产草量的确是有限的。但是，更重要的是，经过人的努力，草原可以建设起来，产草量可以不断提高。如果单纯依赖天然草原发展牲畜，不进行必要的建设，那么，牲畜的发展就要受到限制。天然草原一定的产草量，只能饲养一定数量的牲畜。牲畜的发展超过了天然草原所能负担的载畜量，对草原、对畜牧业的发展都是不利的。承认这样的事实，绝不等于说，在社会主义制度下，由毛泽东思想武装起来的广大牧民，对草原是无能为力的。天然草原经过人的建设，是可以变得更好的。内蒙古自治区的伊克昭盟，草场原来很不好，几年前就有人说，牲畜达到四百万头就不能再发展了。现在全盟的牲畜已突破六百万头，而且还能继续发展。这里是沙丘草原，解放前遭受过严重破坏。解放后，在实际工作中也曾发生过一些缺点。但是，从领导到群众接受了历史的经验教训，树立了革命的发展观点，坚决同不利的自然条件作斗争，开展群众性的草原建设，几年来种草一百万亩，牲畜大大发展了。伊克昭盟的草原是自然条件很差的草原，他们可以大量发展牲畜，充分说明生产到顶，无所作为的说法是没有根据的。
    牧区、半农半牧区畜牧业经济可不可以稳定地上升？这是一个需要正确解决的认识问题。过去有一种说法：畜牧业的大起大落是一种规律。这种说法，只是旧社会生产不稳定的反映。一般说来，大多数牧区，每隔几年就出现一次较大的自然灾害。在旧社会——封建、半封建的社会制度和个体分散的游牧经济条件下，牧民无力同自然灾害作斗争，只能是大灾大损失，小灾小损失。再加上反动统治阶级的大量掠夺，牲畜数量就必然要不断下降。例如，内蒙古自治区在解放以前，从一九三六年到一九四六年的十年中，牲畜就减少了二百万头，平均每年递减百分之二。解放以后，这种情况就根本改变了。广大人民依靠人民公社集体经济的力量，战胜和克服各种自然灾害。许多地区不但风调雨顺的好年景能够增产，在风雪或干旱严重的情况下，经过大力抗灾，也能获得增产。内蒙古自治区在成立以来的十八年中，曾经不断地遭受过严重的自然灾害，其中有四年是特大的灾害。然而，除了一个年份牲畜略有减少外，有十七个年度是连年上升的。全国其他牧区和半农半牧区，同样是逐步上升的。因此，说我们现在的畜牧业时升时降也是规律，那是没有根据的。我们只要坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，依靠人民公社集体经济的力量，依靠广大牧民的革命积极性，积极地进行建设，是完全有可能抗御各种自然灾害，稳定地发展畜牧业的。
    草原有限，草原建设不能一时见效，只能用减少牲畜数量、提高质量的办法来解决矛盾。这又是一种说法。这在一定条件下，做为一种临时措施，并不是不可以的。发展牲畜要注意提高质量，这是完全对的。我国社会主义建设的发展和人民生活的改善，需要更多的大牲畜、细毛羊以及其它优良品种的牲畜。我们发展畜牧业，是要大量增加牲畜头数，不断提高牲畜质量，向国家提供量多、质好的耕、役畜和肉、乳、皮、毛等。所以绝不能光注意数量，不注意质量。问题在于发展牲畜数量，需要建设更多更好的草牧场；提高牲畜质量，同样需要建设更多更好的草牧场。没有一定的物质条件，既不能发展数量，也难以提高质量。把数量和质量割裂开来，降低数量以求质量，这种观点是消极的，因而也就不能正确处理数量和质量的关系。正确的观点应当是，既要发展牲畜数量，又要提高牲畜质量。只要处理得当，发展数量和提高质量可以互相促进。新疆维吾尔自治区在提高牲畜数量、质量方面有显著成绩，全区已有改良牲畜数百万头，牲畜的数量也有很大的发展，这就是最好的证明。
    认为牲畜发展到顶了，牲畜的数量不能再增加了，草牧场已经“饱和”了，这种种说法，有一个共同点，就是没有看到牧民群众建设草原的主观能动作用。这是落后于客观实际的旧思想。现在，牧区社会主义的集体经济日益发展巩固，牧民觉悟空前提高。应当坚定地相信，革命的牧民，在党的领导下，决不甘心靠天养畜，作大自然的奴隶，而要千方百计地发挥人的威力，挖掘潜力，改造草原，建设草原。许多未被利用的草原可以开发扩大；不大好的草原经过建设可以变好；好的草原经过建设，可以提高产草量。虽然，在现有条件下，还不可能作到完全不靠天，但逐渐增加靠人的因素，减少靠天的因素，却是可以做到的。在革命人民看来，自然是可以逐步改造的，生产总是要向前发展的。这是生产斗争，同时也是人们思想的革命。
    草原能不能建设，牲畜能不能发展，关键是领导机关和干部的思想革命化。要学会用大寨的革命精神，用乌审召公社自力更生建设牧区的革命精神，建设牧区和半农半牧区。要树立革命的发展的观点，正确地指导牧区建设工作。内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟解放时牲畜头数为一百三十万头，现在已经发展到九百二十万头。这个事实告诉我们，用革命的发展观点指导我们的工作会产生多么大的成果。毛泽东同志说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”我们应该不折不扣地把毛泽东同志的教导运用到发展畜牧业生产和建设草原中去，它将对我国的社会主义牧区、半农半牧区的建设产生极其伟大的力量。
