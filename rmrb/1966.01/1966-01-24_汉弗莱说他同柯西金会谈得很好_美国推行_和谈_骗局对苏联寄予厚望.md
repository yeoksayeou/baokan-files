　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 23rd: Washington news: U.S. Vice President Humphrey, in a radio program on the 22nd, spoke about his recent trip to Southeast Asia to peddle the U.S. "peace talk" fraud, particularly expressing satisfaction with his meeting with Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Kosygin in New Delhi. He said that in the meeting, Kosygin "had no unusually emotional, intense remarks," and the "conversation went well."
　　A reporter asked Humphrey whether, based on this meeting, the U.S. "has realistic reasons to expect the Russians" to "exert a moderating influence" on the Vietnam issue? Humphrey replied: "Yes, we harbor such hopes; and, I think, perhaps there is some reason to place some hope in Soviet actions." Humphrey said, "I think Russia is engaged in a very serious struggle with the Chinese Communists," therefore, for the Soviet leaders, "everything else happening in the world is secondary." Humphrey believes that the Soviet leadership group "is trying to contain Communist China, and one of the best ways to achieve containment may be to bring peace to Southeast Asia." He said: "In the long run, I don't believe a turbulent Southeast Asia is beneficial to the Soviet Union."
　　Humphrey made every effort to peddle the so-called "peace basket" – the fourteen-point plan – recently proposed by the U.S. government, swearing that the United States has a "sincere desire" to "seek peace." However, he could not hide the true intention of the United States to stubbornly remain in South Vietnam. Humphrey emphasized that the United States would never accept the demand for it to get out of Vietnam. He clamored: "We do not consider this a legitimate demand."
　　Humphrey's television talk once again nakedly exposed the United States' aggressive aims and methods in Vietnam. He said that the United States has two goals in South Vietnam. The first goal is called "resisting aggression." That is to say, to maintain the so-called "freedom and independence" of the South Vietnamese puppet government. The second goal is called "achieving peace." Humphrey emphasized that "the second goal is to achieve the first goal." He said that therefore, the United States "will continue to strongly promote negotiations, to meet at the peace table, ... rather than to achieve understanding and solve problems through violence and war." That is to say, to achieve through negotiations what the United States cannot achieve on the battlefield.
　　Humphrey also talked about his trip to Japan to win over the Sato government to serve the U.S. "peace talk" fraud. He revealed that he gave Sato a document that talked about the U.S. government's "fourteen points." Later, Sato, in front of Humphrey, instructed Foreign Minister Shiina, who was about to visit the Soviet Union, to "convey to Moscow the sincere desire of the U.S. President (to seek peace); he also instructed his Foreign Minister to do everything possible to encourage the Soviet Union to play a moderating influence in Southeast Asia and to bring Hanoi to the negotiating table."

### 汉弗莱说他同柯西金会谈得很好  美国推行“和谈”骗局对苏联寄予厚望

    汉弗莱说他同柯西金会谈得很好
    美国推行“和谈”骗局对苏联寄予厚望
    新华社二十三日讯  华盛顿消息：美国副总统汉弗莱二十二日在广播节目中谈到他不久前去东南亚推销美国“和谈”骗局之行时，特别对他在新德里同苏联部长会议主席柯西金举行的会谈表示满意。他说，在会谈中，柯西金“没有什么不寻常的感情用事的激烈言论”，“谈话进行得很好。”
    记者问汉弗莱，从这次会谈来看，美国“是否有现实的理由可以期待俄国人”在越南问题上“起促使缓和的影响”？汉弗莱回答说：“是的，我们抱有这种希望；而且，我想，也许有某种理由对苏联的行动寄以某些希望。”汉弗莱说，“我认为，俄国正在和中国共产党人进行非常严重的斗争”，因此，就苏联领导人来说，“在世界上发生的其他一切情况都处于次要地位”。汉弗莱认为，苏联领导集团“力图遏制共产党中国，而要达到遏制这个目标，最好的途径之一可能是使东南亚得到和平”。他说：“从长远来看，我不相信一个动荡的东南亚对苏联有利。”
    汉弗莱竭力兜售美国政府不久前提出的所谓“和平篮子”——十四点计划，信誓旦旦地说什么美国有“谋求和平”的“真诚愿望”。但是，他始终无法掩饰美国的真正意图是要死赖在南越不走。汉弗莱强调，美国决不会接受要它从越南滚出去的要求。他叫嚷说：“我们不认为这是一个正当的要求。”
    汉弗莱的电视谈话再次赤裸裸地暴露了美国对越南的侵略目的和手法。他说，美国在南越有两个目标。第一个目标叫做“抵抗侵略”。这就是说，要维护南越傀儡政府的所谓“自由和独立”。第二个目标叫做“得到和平”。汉弗莱着重指出，“第二个目标是为了实现第一个目标的”。他说，因此，美国“将继续大力促使谈判，在和平桌旁会谈，……而不是通过暴力和战争，来取得谅解和解决问题”。这就是说，要通过谈判来取得美国在战场上取不到的东西。
    汉弗莱还谈到了他到日本拉拢佐藤政府替美国“和谈”骗局效劳的情况。他透露，他把谈到美国政府的“十四点”的一个文件交给了佐藤。后来，佐藤当着汉弗莱的面，指示不久就要去苏联访问的外相椎名“向莫斯科转达美国总统（寻求和平）的真诚愿望；他还指示他的外相尽一切可能鼓励苏联在东南亚起促使缓和的影响，并把河内带到谈判桌旁去”。
