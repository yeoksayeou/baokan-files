    The Chinese Folk Art Troupe has successfully concluded its three-week visit and performance in Mali and departed for Guinea on the 9th, according to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Bamako. Their performances were warmly welcomed by the Malian people.

    During its visit and performance in Mali, the art troupe gave eleven performances in Bamako, Ségou, Sikasso, Koutiala, Dougabougou, and other places, attracting over 23,000 viewers. Malian President Modibo Keita, government ministers, leaders of the Sudanese Union Party, and local officials all attended the performances.

    The Chinese folk songs and dances performed by the art troupe were highly appreciated by the Malian people. The dances "Flying Over Luding Bridge," "Wind and Thunder," and "Harvest Song," as well as Chinese and Malian songs, all garnered prolonged applause. These programs were repeated many times at the request of the audience. Enthusiastic viewers rushed to the stage after the performances to shake hands with the Chinese actors, with some excitedly shouting "Long Live the People's Republic of China."

    A Malian government official said: "Through your performances, we have received a vivid political education. The 'Flying Over Luding Bridge' dance reflects the Red Army's heroic combat and revolutionary spirit of fearlessness of sacrifice during the Long March. The 'Wind and Thunder' dance reflects the African people's struggle to get rid of colonial rule. These programs are all educational." A Malian artist who recently visited China said: "Your performances reflect the life and revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the art of New China has continued to develop rapidly."

    After the art troupe's performance in Sikasso, the local administrative head went on stage to congratulate the Chinese actors and said: "Your performances have strengthened the friendship between China and Mali. We are proud to have a friendly country like China." (Attached picture)

    马里人民赞扬我民间艺术团演出
    中国艺术表现了不怕牺牲的革命精神
    据新华社巴马科电  中国民间艺术团成功地结束了在马里进行的历时三周的访问演出，已在九日离开马里前往几内亚。他们演出的节目受到了马里人民的热烈欢迎。
    艺术团在马里访问演出期间，先后在巴马科、塞古、锡卡索、库蒂阿拉和杜加布古等地作了十一次演出，观众达二万三千多人。马里总统莫迪博·凯塔，政府部长，苏丹联盟党领导人和当地负责人等都观看了演出。
    艺术团演出的中国民间流行的歌舞节目，受到了马里人民的高度赞赏，其中中国艺术家表演的“飞夺泸定桥”、“风雷”和“丰收歌”等舞蹈以及中国和马里歌曲，都博得了经久不息的掌声。这些节目在观众的要求下重复演了许多次。热情的观众在演出结束后纷纷涌向舞台，同中国演员握手，有些人激动地高呼“中华人民共和国万岁”。
    一位马里政府官员说：“通过你们的演出，我们受到了一次生动的政治教育。‘飞夺泸定桥’舞蹈反映了红军在长征时所表现的英勇战斗和不怕牺牲的革命精神。‘风雷’舞蹈反映了非洲人民为摆脱殖民统治而进行的斗争。这些节目都具有教育意义。”一位最近访问过中国的马里艺术家说：“你们的演出反映了中国人民的生活和革命斗争。在毛泽东主席的领导下，新中国的艺术不断有了迅速的发展。”
    艺术团在锡卡索演出结束后，当地的行政长官走上舞台，向中国演员祝贺，并且说：“你们的演出加强了中国和马里之间的友谊。我们为有着中国那样的友好国家而感到自豪。”（附图片）
