    It was already dusk, and the afterglow of the setting sun was still scorching. I took a break at the air defense哨所 (shào suǒ, guard post) along the Bai Shang route in Qinghua. Before me unfolded a very busy and intense harvest scene. On the boundless golden rice fields, groups of people swiftly wielding their sickles to harvest seemed to be gradually rolling up an enormous golden carpet. Caravans laden with rice were driving to the villages in an endless stream.
    It was a beautiful moonlit night. The surrounding cooperatives were bustling, resembling a giant construction site. Even late at night, the sound of threshing continued to come from the villages. People, whether they met on the road, in teahouses, or on ferries, would naturally ask each other: "How much grain did you harvest per *fen* of land?" Comrade L, the secretary of the Shou Chun County Party Committee, told me in concise and powerful words: "Producing while fighting, we have now achieved victory on both fronts. Working under the bombs of the American bandits, everyone deeply feels that they are growing stronger."
    From the time of the autumn rice sowing season, American imperialism has continuously carried out wanton bombings here. The call to resist America and save the nation has inspired everyone here to strive for the lead. More and more people were setting out to participate in the battle, and the manpower decreased, but the tasks increased instead. So people launched one "campaign" after another, initiating a month-long movement to vigorously develop water conservancy and field management. American bandit planes bombed the Bai Shang Dam ten times and the Pan Shi sluice gate eleven times, but, as the farmers here sang:
    "Although the American bandits light lanterns (note: release flares),
    We redouble our efforts to repair the dikes;
    If the American bandits dare to intrude,
    We will immediately bury them!"
    Shou Chun County quickly completed the water conservancy project, allowing the clear spring water to continuously irrigate the fertile fields here along the canals.
    July was the rice transplanting season, and American bandits harassed the skies over Shou Chun day and night. But the people of Shou Chun still worked in the fields in groups of three and five. As soon as the American bandit planes arrived, the militiamen responsible for duty immediately gave them a head-on blow. The villagers of the Chun Pei Cooperative fought the American bandits thirty-six times, but still completed the farming tasks in a timely manner. Here, sometimes the villagers were working at night when suddenly a phosphorus incendiary bomb dropped by the enemy somewhere ignited a raging fire. But once the fire was extinguished, people continued to work. In the flames of war, people also adopted many new farming techniques, vigorously accumulating fertilizer and weeding.
    In this way, after five consecutive months of hard work under the enemy's bombing, the farmers of Shou Chun County won an unprecedented bumper harvest.
    Under the bright moonlight, standing on the threshing floor, seeing people carrying rice in pairs, people will never forget the glorious battle achievements made by the soldiers and civilians of Shou Chun County. In this autumn rice planting season of resisting America and saving the nation, it was they who shot down, damaged, and hit thirty-two American jet planes, causing them to catch fire.
    It was late at night, and the loud and moving singing further strengthened people's confidence in victory!

    战斗中的丰收〔越南〕友德
    已是黄昏时分，夕阳的余辉仍然灼热无比。我在清化一拜尚途中的防空哨所里歇脚。面前展现着一幅十分繁忙紧张的丰收图景。在一望无际的金黄色的稻田上，一群群正在飞快地挥镰收割的人们，仿佛正在逐渐收卷起一块巨大无比的金黄地毯，满载稻谷的车队络绎不绝地往村庄驶去。
    这是一个美丽的月夜。四周的合作社一片繁忙，简直象是一个巨大的工地。直到夜深，村子里还不断传来打谷的声音。人们不管在路上，在茶店里或在渡船上相逢，都会很自然地相互询问：“你们一分地打多少粮食呀？”寿春县委书记L同志以简短有力的话语对我说：“边生产，边战斗，现在我们在这两条战线上都取得了胜利。我们在美国强盗的炸弹下劳动，每一个人都深深感到自己在成长壮大”。
    从秋稻播种时节开始，美帝国主义就接连不断地对这里进行了狂轰滥炸。抗美救国的号召，激励着这里的每一个人，奋勇争先。出发参加战斗的人越来越多了，人力减少了，但是任务却反而增加。于是人们开展了一个又一个“战役”，发动了为时一个月的大搞水利和田间管理运动。美国强盗飞机曾经十次轰炸这里的拜尚水坝，十一次轰炸盘石水闸，但是，正如这里的农民所唱的：
    “尽管美国强盗放灯笼（注：放照明弹），
    咱们加把劲头修堤坝；
    要是美国强盗闯过来，
    咱们立刻埋葬它！”
    寿春县很快就完成了水利工程的任务，使清清的泉水，沿着渠道源源不断地灌溉着这里肥沃的田地。
    七月，正是插秧时节，美国强盗日夜不停地窜扰着寿春的天空。但寿春人民仍然三五成群地在田里干活。美国强盗飞机一到，负责值班战斗的民兵们立刻就给以迎头痛击。春沛合作社的乡亲们曾经对美国强盗进行了三十六次战斗，但仍及时完成了耕作任务。在这里，有时老乡们晚上正在耕作，突然间不知敌人在哪里扔下的磷燃烧弹却烧起熊熊烈火。但一当烈火熄灭，人们又继续耕作。在战火中，人们还采用了许多新的耕作技术，大力积肥和除虫除草。
    就这样，经过连续五个月在敌人的轰炸下辛勤劳动，寿春县的农民夺得了空前的丰收。
    在明亮的月色下，站在晒谷场上，看到人们成群结队地挑着稻谷走去。人们永远不会忘记寿春县军民所立下的辉煌战功。在这个抗美救国的秋稻种作季节，是他们，使三十二架美国喷气式飞机被击落、击伤和击中起火。
    夜深了，嘹亮、动人的歌声，更加强了人们胜利的信心！
