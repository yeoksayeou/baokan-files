    Johnson's government has staged a brazenly shameless farce regarding the Vietnam issue for the past month. They have chanted "peace," "peace," "peace" almost daily, but what they have done is war, war, war. Consider this:
    On December 28th, the United States sent 4,000 more troops to South Vietnam.
    On January 18th, the United States sent another 9,000 invading troops to South Vietnam.
    On January 19th, Johnson formally requested an additional $12.3 billion in military spending for the invasion of Vietnam.
    On January 20th, McNamara announced that the United States military would increase its forces by more than 450,000.
    The facts once again eloquently demonstrate that the higher the pitch of the American aggressors' "peace" tune, the more vigorously they are plotting to fuel the flames of the war of aggression in Vietnam.
    Determining whether the United States government has any sincerity in peacefully resolving the Vietnam issue does not require profound scholarship. It is simple; one can draw a conclusion by simply looking at its actions. From December 24th of last year, when the United States "suspended bombing" of North Vietnam and launched the much-touted so-called "peace offensive," to today, a full month has passed. During this period, the "peace" rhetoric uttered by the Johnson government in various settings and with the same tone has been voluminous, reeking, lengthy, and plentiful. But what have they actually done?
    Have they stopped the war of aggression in South Vietnam? No. On the contrary, they are implementing the "kill all, burn all, destroy all" scorched earth policy on an even larger scale than before.
    Have they withdrawn a single soldier from South Vietnam? No. On the contrary, they have transported another 13,000 invading troops to the South Vietnamese battlefield.
    Have they shown even the slightest mercy to the people of South Vietnam? No. On the contrary, they are more frantically releasing poisonous gas, and their methods of killing are even more brutal.
    Anyone who respects the facts will see that the Johnson government has not the slightest desire to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue in accordance with the will of the Vietnamese people. All they have are belligerent actions of deploying more troops, more ammunition, and more dollars into the Vietnam War.
    From the past and present actions of the American aggressors, it is not difficult to know what they will do tomorrow. In the past, every time they chanted "peace," they added fuel to the fire of the war of aggression. Today, they are releasing a "peace talk" wind while intensifying the expansion of the war. The reason why they have to resort to political deception is because they see that they can no longer use purely military means to stop the victorious development of the South Vietnamese people's liberation struggle. However, once their political deception is completely bankrupt, they will continue to act recklessly, attempting to find a way out by expanding the war. Precisely because of this, every carefully crafted "peace talk" hoax by the Johnson government is always exposed by itself. Johnson said clearly in his State of the Union address on January 12th, "If" the peace talk hoax "cannot be realized," the United States "will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, every dollar, and every decision—whatever the cost, whatever the challenge." McNamara also stated explicitly on January 20th that in order to "defeat the Communists and secure the freedom of South Vietnam," the United States would provide "as many troops" as "required" there. The current reality is that the American aggressors are sliding down the slope of expanding the war, and they are determined to impose a more cruel and barbarous war of aggression on the people of Vietnam and Indochina.
    On the soil of Vietnam, a life-or-death contest is underway. Either the aggressors are driven out in accordance with the will of the Vietnamese people, thereby completing the cause of Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity; or Vietnam is divided and South Vietnam is occupied in accordance with the will of the aggressors, thereby plunging the Vietnamese people into the abyss of enslavement and exploitation. This is a desperate struggle. The enemy is extremely vicious and extremely cruel. However, the result of this struggle will inevitably violate the will of U.S. imperialism and end in the defeat of the aggressors. The reason is simple: in the struggle between the Vietnamese people on one side and the American aggressors on the other, the Vietnamese people are the principal aspect of the contradiction. It is not U.S. imperialism that determines the direction of the development of Vietnamese history, but the 31 million Vietnamese people.
    The Johnson government's massive increase in troops in South Vietnam, expansion of military spending for the invasion of Vietnam, and frantic expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam is a blatant provocation to the Vietnamese people. The spokesman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on January 21st, strongly condemning the United States for increasing troops in South Vietnam under the smoke screen of "peace," and reiterated the warning of the Vietnamese people: "No amount of troops of the American aggressors can save them from their predicament in South Vietnam." The New Year's editorial of the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency pointed out: "The Vietnamese people have no illusions about the deceptive 'peace' rhetoric of the warmongering American leaders. The Vietnamese people must concentrate all their strength and strike the American imperialists even harder." These powerful words once again express the dignified will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to defend national independence and national dignity and resist imperialist aggression. The Chinese government and people firmly support the Vietnamese people's firm stance of carrying the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation through to the end. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, who have been tempered in the flames of the anti-imperialist struggle for 20 years, will surely make persistent efforts, raise the hammer, smash the Johnson government's plan to expand the war, and smash the American aggressors who have invaded Vietnam.

### 约翰逊政府的自我揭露

    约翰逊政府的自我揭露
    约翰逊政府围绕着越南问题，一个月来上演了一出无耻透顶的丑剧。它们几乎天天高唱“和平”、“和平”、“和平”，但是，干的却是战争、战争、战争。请看：
    十二月二十八日，美国向南越增兵四千人。
    一月十八日，美国又把侵略军九千人派往南越。
    一月十九日，约翰逊正式要求追加侵越军费一百二十三亿多美元。
    一月二十日，麦克纳马拉宣布美国三军扩充兵力四十五万多人。
    事实再一次雄辩地表明：美国侵略者的“和平”调门提得越高之日，正是它们加紧策划把侵越战火烧得更旺之时。
    判断美国政府有没有和平解决越南问题的诚意，并不需要高深的学问。很简单，只要看看它的行动，就可以得出结论。从去年十二月二十四日美国“暂停轰炸”越南北方，发动了喧闹一时的所谓“和平攻势”以来，到今天整整一个月了。在这段时期里，约翰逊政府在不同场合、用相同声调发表的“和平”言词，真是洋洋万言，又臭、又长、又多。但是，它们实际上干了些什么呢？
    它们是不是停止了侵略南越的战争了呢？没有。恰恰相反，它们比以前更大规模地推行“杀光、烧光、毁光”的焦土政策。
    它们是不是从南越撤出一兵一卒了呢？没有。恰恰相反，它们又把一万三千名侵略军运进了南越战场。
    它们是不是对南越人民略为手下留情了呢？没有。恰恰相反，它们更疯狂地施放毒气，杀人手段更加残暴。
    任何人，只要尊重事实，都会看到，约翰逊政府根本没有按照越南人民的意志和平解决越南问题的一分一厘一丝一毫的愿望，有的只是拿出更多的军队、更多的弹药、更多的美元投入越南战争的好战行动。
    从美国侵略者过去和今天的行动，人们不难知道它们明天要干的是什么。过去，它们每念一次“和平”经，就在侵略战争中添一把火。今天，它们大放“和谈”风，同时加紧扩大战争。它们所以不得不玩弄政治欺骗的手段，是因为他们看到已经无法用单纯的军事手段阻止南越人民解放斗争的胜利发展；但是，一当它们的政治欺骗手段彻底破产，它们就继续蛮干，妄图从扩大战争中寻找出路。正是因为这样，约翰逊政府每次精心炮制的“和谈”骗局，总是被它自己加以戳破。约翰逊一月十二日在国情咨文中说得清清楚楚：“如果实现不了”和谈骗局，美国“将使我们的战斗人员得到他们必须得到的东西：每一支枪、每一块美元和每一个决定——不管费用多大，也不管挑战多大”。麦克纳马拉一月二十日也说得明明白白，为了“击败共产党人和保障南越的自由”，那里“需要多少部队”，美国“就拿出多少部队”。目前的事实是，美国侵略者正在沿着扩大战争的斜坡滑下去，它们硬要把一场更残酷、更野蛮的侵略战争强加在越南人民和印度支那人民的头上。
    在越南的土地上，一场你死我活的较量正在进行。要么是按照越南人民的意志，把侵略者赶出去，从而完成越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的事业；要么是按照侵略者的意志，分割越南和占领南越，从而把越南人民置于受奴役和被宰割的深渊之中。这是一场殊死的斗争。敌人是十分凶恶的、极端残忍的。但是，这场斗争的结果，必然违反美帝国主义的意志，以侵略者的失败而告终。原因很简单：在以越南人民为一方和以美国侵略者为一方的搏斗中，越南人民是矛盾的主要方面。决定越南历史的发展方向的，不是美帝国主义，而是三千一百万越南人民。
    约翰逊政府大举增兵南越、扩充侵越军费，疯狂扩大侵越战争，是对越南人民的露骨挑衅。越南外交部发言人一月二十一日发表声明，强烈谴责美国在“和平”烟幕下增兵南越，并且重申越南人民的警告：“美国侵略者的任何军队都挽救不了他们在越南南方的危困局面”。越南南方解放通讯社的新年社论指出：“越南人民对美国好战头子们骗人的‘和平’论调不抱幻想。越南人民必须集中一切力量，更狠地打击美帝国主义。”这些有力的字句，再一次表达了三千一百万越南人民保卫国家独立和民族尊严、反抗帝国主义侵略的凛然意志。中国政府和人民，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的坚定立场。中国人民坚信，二十年来在反帝斗争烈火中久经锻炼的越南人民，定将再接再厉，举起铁锤，把约翰逊政府扩大战争的计划砸得粉碎，把侵入越南的美国侵略者砸得粉碎。
