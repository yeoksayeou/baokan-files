    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, Eleventh: White House spokesman Moyers confirmed on the 10th that the Johnson administration will soon request Congress to allocate an additional $13 billion for war funds to invade Vietnam. This is further proof that Johnson is intensifying preparations to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam under the smoke screen of "peace."

    This will be the second time the Johnson administration has requested additional war funds for aggression against Vietnam in the 1965-1966 fiscal year, which ends at the end of June this year; it already requested an additional $1.7 billion last August. This will bring military spending for the year to over $62 billion, a record high since the end of World War II.

    Moyers also announced that Johnson convened another meeting of senior military and government officials at the White House on the 10th to discuss the Vietnam issue. It is reported that the situation in Vietnam, including Shelepin's visit to Hanoi, was the subject of discussion at the White House meeting on Monday.

    While demanding a substantial increase in war funds for aggression against Vietnam, the US government continues to intensify its "peace talk" fraud. US Representative to the United Nations Goldberg met with UN Secretary-General U Thant for an hour and a half. Goldberg told reporters that he was instructed by Johnson to give U Thant a "comprehensive briefing" on the recent series of "peace" activities carried out by the United States. Subsequently, U Thant met with the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Federin. Later, U Thant also held separate talks with the British and French representatives to the United Nations. According to a UN spokesman, U Thant "discussed several issues of common concern, including the Vietnam issue" with them. According to reports from Canberra, Johnson's "peace envoy" Harriman, after arriving in Australia, held talks with the Menzies government on the 10th, demanding that the latter send more cannon fodder to South Vietnam to serve the United States. Some newspapers in Canberra used the headline "Harriman Asks for More Soldiers" when reporting on Harriman's visit. It is reported that Harriman told reporters at the airport when he arrived in Canberra on the 9th that "President Johnson is still determined not to allow South Vietnam to be taken over by force." It has been announced that Harriman will also go to Saigon on the 12th for activities.

    “和平攻势”在继续　战争准备在加紧
    约翰逊一面研究谢列平访越一面要求追加侵越战费
    哈里曼一手兜售和谈骗局一手拉人提供大量新炮灰
    新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫发言人莫耶斯十日证实，约翰逊政府即将要求国会增拨侵越战费一百三十亿美元。这是约翰逊在“和平”烟幕下加紧准备扩大侵越战争的又一证明。
    这将是约翰逊政府在到今年六月底为止的一九六五——一九六六财政年度内的第二次追加侵越战费；去年八月，它已经要求追加了十七亿美元。这样，就将使本年度的军费支出高达六百二十亿美元以上，创第二次大战结束以来的最高纪录。
    莫耶斯同时宣布，约翰逊十日再次召集高级军政官员在白宫开会讨论越南问题。据报道，越南局势，包括谢列平对河内的访问，是星期一这次白宫会议讨论的题目。
    美国政府在要求大大增加侵越战争费用的同时，继续加紧推行它的“和谈”骗局。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡同联合国秘书长吴丹会谈了一个半小时。戈德堡对记者说，他奉约翰逊的指示，就美国最近进行的一系列“和平”活动，向吴丹作了一次“全面的汇报”。接着，吴丹就约见了苏联驻联合国代表费德林。后来，吴丹又分别同英国及法国驻联合国代表举行了会谈。据联合国发言人宣布，吴丹同他们“讨论了包括越南问题在内的几个共同问题”。据来自堪培拉的消息，约翰逊的“和平特使”哈里曼到澳大利亚后，已在十日同孟席斯政府举行了会谈，要求后者增派炮灰到南越为美国卖命。堪培拉一些报纸在报道哈里曼访问的消息时，用的标题是：《哈里曼要求派遣更多的士兵》。据报道，哈里曼九日到达堪培拉时，在机场上对记者说，“约翰逊总统仍然决心不让南越被通过武力接管。”据宣布，哈里曼十二日还要去西贡活动。
