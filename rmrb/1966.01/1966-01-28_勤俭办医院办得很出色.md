    This newspaper reports, according to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency: A certain medical center within the military medical department of the South-Central region of South Vietnam has actively implemented the principle of self-reliance and diligence and frugality in running medical services, achieving outstanding results. The medical center's staff has made every effort to overcome difficulties, and in the face of rudimentary equipment, researched methods for extracting distilled water and preparing crystalline salts, providing emergency treatment for patients with abnormal body water levels and curing some patients with intestinal obstruction. This medical center also uses plastic surgery methods to treat fractured soldiers, especially those with major bone fractures. Medical personnel have also successfully performed skin grafts on dozens of soldiers with skin burns. They are currently researching the use of frog skin to treat soldiers with large-area burns.
    Personnel at this medical center have promoted the spirit of self-reliance, independently solving the difficulties of insufficient equipment and lack of raw materials, making highly precise balances and anatomical medical equipment themselves, and producing a solution to replace soap for washing bandages and other instruments.
    In addition, this medical center has summarized two medical experiences with medical research value. These two experiences are methods for treating napalm burns and methods for treating fractures and wounds. (Attached picture)

    勤俭办医院办得很出色
    本报讯　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方中部南区军医部门某医疗所积极贯彻自力更生、勤俭办医疗事业的方针，获得了出色的成绩。医疗所的工作人员千方百计克服困难，在设备简陋的情况下，研究出提取蒸馏水的方法和配制结晶盐，为肌体水分失常的病人进行急救和治好了一些肠梗塞的病人。这个医疗所还采用整型手术的方法，治疗折骨的伤员，特别是大骨折断的伤员。医疗人员还成功地为成十名皮肤受灼伤的伤员植皮。目前他们正在研究用青蛙皮为大面积受灼伤的伤员治疗。
    这个医疗所的人员发扬自力更生精神，自行解决设备不足和原料缺乏的困难，自己动手制成了高度精密天平和解剖用的医疗器材，生产出一种溶液来代替肥皂洗涤绷带和其他器具。
    此外，这个医疗所还总结了两项具有医学研究价值的医疗经验。这两项经验是治疗凝固汽油弹灼伤的方法和治疗骨折和伤口的方法。（附图片）
