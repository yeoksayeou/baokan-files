    The US Vice President said after the talks that they were carrying out an important mission
    Indian News Agency Reported that the Vietnam Issue Played a Significant Role in the Talks
    Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, New Delhi Dispatch: Soviet Premier Kosygin held a lengthy secret meeting with US Vice President Humphrey and US Secretary of State Rusk at the Soviet Embassy in India in New Delhi on the 13th.
    The Soviet side participating in the meeting included Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin. The US side included US Ambassador to India Bowles.
    It is reported that the meeting lasted for one hour and forty-five minutes, "one of the longest meetings between US and Soviet leaders in recent years" (United Press International).
    According to the Indian Press Trust, the "Vietnam issue occupied a significant position" in the meeting. The news agency quoted well-informed sources in New Delhi as saying that the two sides "discussed in detail the recent efforts made by the United States to peacefully resolve the Vietnam conflict in the talks." The Indian Press Trust also said that because Humphrey's meeting with Kosygin lasted longer than he had planned, he was late for his scheduled meeting with Kamaraj, the leader of the Indian National Congress. Humphrey told Kamaraj: "Sorry we were delayed because we were carrying out an important mission."
    United Press International reported that Humphrey and US Ambassador to India Bowles smiled as they came out after the meeting, "they raised two fingers to the reporters forming the traditional V-shape representing victory."
    Humphrey refused to answer any questions from reporters. He simply said, "We had a good, constructive, and friendly visit."
    Associated Press reported that "there are reliable signs" that Humphrey's meeting with Kosygin "produced encouraging results." The news agency also quoted "a very senior person" as saying that the meeting "was not disappointing." The news agency also quoted US officials in New Delhi as saying, "Orders have been issued to prohibit the release of any news about the meeting," "Before releasing any news, the Vice President (Humphrey) will first report to Johnson."
    It is reported that US President Johnson is waiting to hear Humphrey's report on the meeting. Humphrey left New Delhi the same evening after meeting with Kosygin and rushed back to Washington.
    Kosygin and Humphrey arrived in New Delhi on the 11th and 12th respectively to attend Shastri's funeral held on the 12th.

    在约翰逊发动大规模“和平攻势”的时候
    柯西金同汉弗莱腊斯克作什么交易？
    美国副总统会谈后表示他们在执行重要使命
    印托社透露越南问题在会谈中占着显著地位
    新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：苏联部长会议主席柯西金十三日在新德里的苏联驻印度大使馆同美国副总统汉弗莱、美国国务卿腊斯克举行了长时间的秘密会谈。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有外交部副部长费留宾。美国方面有美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯。
    据报道，这次会谈共进行了一小时又四十五分钟，“是最近几年来美苏两国领导人之间举行的时间最长的会谈之一”
  （合众国际社）。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，在这次会谈中“越南问题占显著地位”。这家通讯社援引新德里消息灵通人士的话说，双方“在会谈中详细地讨论了美国最近为了和平地解决越南冲突而加强的努力。”印度报业托辣斯还说，由于汉弗莱同柯西金会谈的时间比他计划的时间拖长，使他在同印度国大党领导人卡马拉季约定的会谈中迟到了。汉弗莱对卡马拉季说：“抱歉，我们耽搁了，因为我们在执行一次重要的使命。”
    合众国际社报道说，汉弗莱和美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯在会谈后出来时微笑着，“他们向记者翘起两个指头形成传统地代表胜利的V字形”。
    汉弗莱拒绝回答记者的任何问题。他仅仅说，“我们进行了一次很好的、富有建设性的友谊拜访。”
    美联社的消息说，“有可靠的迹象表明”，汉弗莱同柯西金的会谈“产生了令人鼓舞的结果。”这家通讯社还援引“一位非常高级人士”的话说，这次会谈“是不令人失望的”。这家通讯社还援引在新德里的美国官员的话说，“已经下令禁止发表有关这次会谈的任何消息”，“在发表任何消息以前，副总统（汉弗莱）将首先向约翰逊报告。”
    据报道，美国总统约翰逊正在等待听取汉弗莱就这次会谈提出的报告。汉弗莱已在同柯西金举行会谈后的当天晚间离开新德里赶回华盛顿。
    柯西金和汉弗莱是在十一日和十二日先后到达新德里参加在十二日举行的夏斯特里的葬礼的。
