	When everyone is joyfully celebrating our traditional festival – the Spring Festival, we read articles written by cultural, educational, and health workers from various regions. These articles share a distinct characteristic: under the leadership of the Party and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, an increasing number of people are going to factories and rural areas, integrating themselves with the workers and peasants.
	Our cultural, educational, and health work is to serve the people. To serve the people, we must understand the vast majority of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be familiar with their lives, work, and thoughts. Only in this way can we have common thoughts, common feelings, and a common language with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and better serve them. Cultural, educational, and health workers going to factories, rural areas, shops, and companies, and striving to transform themselves, is a heartening step towards integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
	In the new year, we hope that cultural, educational, and health workers will advance along the path of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, and more widely create an atmosphere of deeply immersing themselves among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    可喜的一步
    在大家欢度我们传统节日——春节的时候，读到了来自各地的文化、教育、卫生工作者所写的文章。这些文章有一个鲜明的特点：就是在党的领导和毛泽东思想的哺育下，越来越多的人走向工厂和农村，与工农群众相结合。
    我们的文化、教育、卫生工作是为人民服务的。要为人民服务，就要懂得最大多数的工农兵，就要熟悉他们的生活、工作和思想。只有这样，才能与工农兵有共同的思想，共同的感情，共同的语言，才能更好地为他们服务。文化、教育、卫生工作者走向工厂、农村、商店和连队，努力改造自己，就是迈出与工农兵相结合的可喜的一步。
    在新的一年里，我们希望文化、教育、卫生工作者，沿着毛泽东同志指出的与工农兵相结合的道路前进，更广泛地造成深入工农兵群众的风气。
