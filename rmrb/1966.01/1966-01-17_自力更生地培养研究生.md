    Cultivating Graduate Students Through Self-Reliance
    By People's Daily Commentator
    Strengthening the cultivation of graduate students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine is an important aspect of our endeavor to nurture outstanding reserve forces for science and technology and to catch up with the world's advanced levels. It occupies an important position in China's higher education.

    How should we cultivate graduate students? Our guiding principle is self-reliance. That is, we rely on our own efforts, on the faculty and technical strength of our universities and scientific research institutions, and strive to cultivate them ourselves. Of course, we also hope that foreign countries will help us train them, but our foundation must be built on our own strength.

    Sending graduate students to foreign countries for training cannot, in terms of quantity, specialization, or the integration with China's situation and needs, meet and adapt to the needs of China's socialist construction. Cultivating graduate students ourselves is a different matter. Since 1959, we have strengthened the work of cultivating graduate students through self-reliance. In just over six years, the number of graduate students enrolled by universities and scientific research institutions across the country is four times the number of students sent abroad for study and research since liberation; the number of specialties has increased year by year; and the quality has continuously improved. In the past, graduate students in some technical specialties relied entirely on foreign training, but now we can train them ourselves.

    To cultivate graduate students, we must adhere to the principle of self-reliance. In terms of training methods, we must also take our own path. That is, highlighting politics, combining theory with practice, and combining collective training with individual guidance from mentors.

    Any work must highlight politics, and the cultivation of graduate students must emphasize it even more. Graduate students mainly study on their own, and they also devote much time to professional and technical learning, which can easily lead to a tendency to neglect politics. This makes it even more necessary to strengthen ideological and political work. Highlighting politics means taking Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, creatively studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and strengthening the tempering of class struggle and productive labor. Only by strengthening ideological and political work can we ensure that graduate students are both "red" and "expert," and continuously improve their ideological awareness, enabling them to correctly handle the relationship between "redness" and "expertise." Our graduate students should be capable of both mental and physical labor. Only in this way can they become true proletarian intellectuals and better serve the people.

    Graduate students' learning cannot be confined to studying in their rooms. Comrade Mao Zedong said:
  "Intellectuals accept the experience of their predecessors, mainly by reading books. Of course, books must be read, but reading alone cannot solve problems. We must study the current situation, study actual experience and materials." The learning of graduate students must combine theory with practice. They must not only lay a solid theoretical foundation but also hone their ability to conduct independent research and solve practical problems, and increase their practical skills and talents in production struggles and scientific experiments.

    China's Third Five-Year Plan has already begun. With the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production and science and technology, more and higher demands are being placed on science and technology talent. Therefore, universities and scientific research institutions that are responsible for cultivating graduate students must earnestly strengthen the work of cultivating graduate students. Outstanding graduates of universities and colleges, as well as employed personnel who meet the conditions for applying to be graduate students, should actively apply, to train more high-level science and technology talent and continuously replenish and strengthen China's science and technology ranks.

    自力更生地培养研究生
    本报评论员
    加强理工农医各科研究生的培养工作，是我们培养优秀的科学技术后备力量，赶超世界先进水平的一个重要方面，在我国高等教育事业中占有重要的地位。
    怎样培养研究生呢？我们的方针是自力更生，就是说，依靠自己的努力，依靠高等学校和科学研究机构的师资和技术力量，自己努力培养。当然，我们也希望外国代为培养，但是我们的基点要建立在自己的力量上。
    送研究生到外国培养，在数量上，在专业上，在结合我国的情况和需要上，都不能满足和适应我国社会主义建设的需要。自己培养研究生，情况就不同了。从一九五九年起，我们加强了自力更生地培养研究生的工作，仅仅六年多的时间，全国高等学校和科学研究机构招收的研究生，等于解放以来派出国留学研究生的四倍；专业逐年有所增加；质量不断提高。过去某些完全靠外国培养的技术专业的研究生，现在自己也能培养了。
    培养研究生要坚持自力更生的方针，在培养方法上，也要走我们自己的道路。这就是突出政治，理论联系实际，集体培养和导师个别指导相结合。
    任何工作都要突出政治，培养研究生更要突出政治。研究生主要是个人自学，业务、技术学习也较多，比较容易产生忽视政治的倾向，这就更加需要加强思想政治工作。突出政治，就是以毛泽东思想挂帅，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作；加强阶级斗争、生产劳动的锻炼。只有加强思想政治工作，才能使研究生作到又红又专，不断提高研究生的思想觉悟，使他们能够正确地处理红与专的关系。我们的研究生应当既能脑力劳动，也能体力劳动。只有这样，才能成为名副其实的无产阶级知识分子，才能更好地为人民服务。
    研究生的学习，不能只是在书斋里读书。毛泽东同志说：
  “知识分子接受前人的经验，主要是靠读书。书当然不可不读，但是光读书，还不能解决问题。一定要研究当前的情况，研究实际的经验和材料”。研究生的学习一定要理论联系实际，既要打下扎实的理论基础，又要在生产斗争和科学实验中，锻炼独立进行研究工作和解决实际问题的能力，增长实际本领和才干。
    我国的第三个五年计划已经开始了。随着工农业生产和科学技术的不断发展，对于科学技术人材提出了更多更高的要求。因此，负有培养研究生任务的高等学校、科学研究机构，要认真加强研究生的培养工作。高等院校的应届优秀毕业生、具有报考研究生条件的在职人员，要踊跃报考，以造就更多较高水平的科学技术人材，不断补充和壮大我国的科学技术队伍。
