    The Older Generation, the Next Generation, and This Generation of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army
    Song Zhentao
    Comrade Wang Jie, with deep revolutionary affection, admired the revolutionary predecessors – the "older generation." He said: "With the development of society, we, the younger generation, will take up the weapons from the older generation and continue to fulfill the historical mission. The revolutionary martyrs have fought for our country and set an example for us."
    Comrade Wang Jie, with deep revolutionary affection, was concerned about the revolutionary successors – the "next generation." He said: "How conscious and hardworking are the children of New China! This shows that the revolutionary descendants, under the influence of the revolutionary thought of their predecessors, are growing up healthily and are capable of taking on the burdens of the older generation."
    What a noble sentiment! From this, we can see that in the heart of the communist fighter Comrade Wang Jie, there extends an incomparably broad and long journey. He looks back, and that is the road traveled by the "older generation," with milestones standing one after another, the words "revolution" shining golden on the surface; he looks to the future, and that is the road the "next generation" will travel, with milestones also standing one after another, the words "revolution" equally shining golden on the surface.
    Admiration for the "older generation" of revolutionary predecessors made him understand the responsibility of "this generation," which is to "be a good successor to the revolution and shoulder the heavy burden of the revolution." Concern for the "next generation" of revolutionary successors made him understand the responsibility of "this generation" even more, which is: "To be a revolutionary seed, wherever the Party and the country sow me, I will take root, blossom, and bear fruit there." In short, to defend the socialist country created by the "older generation," and even more to create a communist country for the "next generation," Wang Jie, unafraid of hardship and unafraid of death, accelerated the pace of "this generation."
    "The people who come after will surely be able to persist in the revolution until the final victory!" This is Comrade Wang Jie's vow to the "older generation," his囑咐 instructions to the "next generation," and also a call to "this generation"!

    上一代、下一代和这一代解放军某部
  　宋振涛
    王杰同志怀着革命的深情仰慕革命前辈——“上一代”。他说：“随着社会的发展，我们年青的一代将要接下老一辈手中的武器，继续完成历史的使命。革命先烈为我们打下了江山，为我们树立了榜样。”
    王杰同志怀着革命的深情关注革命后辈——“下一代”。他说：“新中国儿童多么有觉悟啊，多么爱劳动啊！这说明革命的后代，在前辈的革命思想熏陶下，正在健康地成长，他们能够接下老一辈的担子。”
    这是多么崇高的情怀啊！我们从这里看到，在共产主义战士王杰同志的心里，伸延着一条无比广阔漫长的征途。他回顾身后，那是“上一代”走过的路，竖着一座座里程碑，碑面上是金光灿灿的“革命”二字；他展望远方，那是“下一代”将要走的路，那里也竖着一座座里程碑，碑面上同样是金光灿灿的“革命”二字。
    对于“上一代”革命前辈的仰慕，使他懂得了自己“这一代”的责任，那就是要“当好革命接班人，把革命的重担挑起来。”对于“下一代”革命后辈的关注，使他更懂得了自己“这一代”的责任，那就是：“要做一个革命的良种，党和国家把我撒到那里，我就在那里生根、开花、结果。”总之，为了守住“上一代”创下的社会主义江山，更为了给“下一代”创出共产主义江山，王杰一不怕苦，二不怕死，加紧了自己“这一代”的脚步。
    “后来的人，一定能把革命坚持到最后的胜利！”这是王杰同志对“上一代”人的誓言，对“下一代”人的叮嘱，也是对我们“这一代”人的召唤！
