    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 10th. The Algerian newspaper *El Moudjahid* published a commentary on the 10th, criticizing the slander against China by imperialism and its followers, and pointed out that the Chinese people are friends of the African people.
    The commentary, referring to the unreasonable severing of diplomatic relations with China by some African countries, said, "A new anti-China wave is sweeping through a part of Africa. Pen-pushers serving imperialism are seizing the opportunity to exaggerate things, eager to make a big deal out of every opportunity, promoting matters as a widespread movement, in order to serve the interests of their masters in all respects."
    The commentary said, "People have no right to lie and insist on saying that friendly China has so-called 'expansionist ambitions' towards African countries. In fact, the lies are utterly ridiculous. Some people are even talking about 'Chinese imperialism,' which demonstrates utter ignorance and is an absurd slander against the Chinese people who have never ceased to provide assistance to the construction endeavors of the African continent."
    The commentary said, "Our continent has suffered from colonial oppression for more than a hundred years, but the People's Republic of China has never been involved." On the contrary, "The Chinese people have often given concrete assistance to the African people struggling to break free from colonialism, and have at least always provided moral and political support."
    The commentary said that, no matter what people say, the fact remains: the tremendous efforts made by the Chinese people and the great achievements they have made in all aspects are a model for most developing countries. This is worthy of admiration, or at least worthy of respect and sympathy. Contrary to what the imperialist newspapers are propagating, the People's Republic of China enjoys the respect and sympathy of the African people. The imperialist newspapers are exploiting the unreasonable actions of those who are trying to cheaply extricate themselves from their domestic difficulties.

    阿尔及利亚报纸抨击帝国主义在非洲策动反华
    非洲各国人民尊重同情中国  帝国主义诬蔑宣传荒谬绝伦
    新华社阿尔及尔十日电  阿尔及利亚《圣战者日报》十日发表评论，抨击帝国主义及其追随者对中国的诬蔑，并且指出中国人民是非洲人民的朋友。
    评论谈到某些非洲国家无理宣布同中国断绝外交关系时说，“一个新的反华浪潮正在冲击非洲的一部分。为帝国主义效劳的玩弄笔头的人，借题发挥，急于夸大其辞，抓住每个机会大事渲染，把事情宣扬成为广泛的运动，以便从各方符合他们主子的利益。”
    评论说，“人们没有权利扯谎，把友好的中国硬说成什么对非洲国家有所谓‘扩张主义的野心’。事实上，扯谎扯得实在不象样子。有些人竟然在谈论‘中国帝国主义’，这说明彻头彻尾的无知，而且是对从来没有停止对非洲大陆各国的建设事业给予援助的中国人民的荒谬绝伦的诬蔑。”
    评论说，“我们大陆遭受殖民主义压迫一百多年，但从来是同中华人民共和国不相干的。”完全相反，“中国人民经常给为摆脱殖民主义而斗争的非洲人民以具体的援助，至少在道义上和政治上始终给予援助。”
    评论说，不管人们怎么说，事实仍然是：中国人民所作的巨大努力和他们在各方面取得的伟大成就，对于大多数发展中的国家来说是一个典范。这是值得钦佩的，至少是值得尊敬和同情的。同帝国主义报纸所宣传的相反，中华人民共和国得到非洲各国人民的尊重和同情。帝国主义报纸正在利用企图便宜地摆脱自己国内困境的那些人的无理行动。
