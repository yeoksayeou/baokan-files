    Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Makes Decision on Strengthening Leadership in Studying Chairman Mao's Works
    Grasping the Study of Chairman Mao's Works is the Primary Task of Party Committees at All Levels
    Requires Leading Cadres at All Levels to First Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought Well, Rely on Mao Zedong Thought to Transform Themselves, and Guide Work
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 24th, The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee recently held a meeting to discuss and make a decision on strengthening the leadership in studying Chairman Mao's works by cadres, requiring Party committees at all levels to take grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works as the primary task at the beginning of this year, and requiring leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought well.
    The decision emphasized that Chairman Mao's books are the supreme instructions for all our work. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arming the broad masses of cadres and people with Mao Zedong Thought, and insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to take command in all work are the fundamental tasks of Party organizations at all levels and the primary responsibility of leading cadres at all levels. If leading cadres do not seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, they will not only be unable to lead the three great revolutionary movements well, lead the study of general cadres and the masses well, but also will make mistakes in the three great revolutionary movements and in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and even be in danger of losing their way.
    The decision pointed out that in studying Chairman Mao's works, we must adhere to the principle of linking theory with practice, study and apply it creatively, study with problems in mind, and make great efforts in the application of this study. Through study, transform our own thinking and solve problems in our work. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the three great revolutionary movements and guide all our practical work. We must creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the socialist education movement to educate cadres and arm the masses. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to raise the consciousness of the broad masses, vigorously promote the movement to increase production and practice economy, complete the Third Five-Year Plan, and catch up with and surpass the advanced levels of world science and technology. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to promote the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in the ideological sphere.
    The decision requires cadres at all levels to carefully read and thoroughly understand the "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" within this year. They should also find time to thoroughly read Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and other works of Chairman Mao, and those with conditions can also choose to read the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
    After the Municipal Party Committee's decision was issued, the broad masses of cadres warmly supported it, and a new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works is being launched throughout the city.
    On the 22nd, Shanghai's *Liberation Daily* published an editorial pointing out: The study of Chairman Mao's works by cadres at all levels in Shanghai has a new beginning. Now, what is important is that leaders at all levels earnestly grasp it, creatively study and apply it, and persist in it for a long time. Whether or not we can persist depends on the leadership. In the past, some comrades did not study well, often emphasizing that their work was too busy. Revolutionary work is always busy. Work is important, but studying Chairman Mao's works is even more important. Without study, work cannot be done well, it will become futile, and may even lead to mistakes. The heavier the task and the busier the work, the more necessary it is to seriously study Chairman Mao's works. We must be determined to study diligently with a strong demand and desire for the Chinese revolution, the world revolution, and self-transformation.

    上海市委作出加强干部学习毛主席著作的领导的决定
    抓好学习毛主席著作是各级党委首要任务
    要求各级领导干部首先学好用好毛泽东思想，依靠毛泽东思想改造自己，指导工作
    据新华社上海二十四日电  中共上海市委不久前召开会议，讨论并作出关于加强干部学习毛主席著作的领导的决定，要求各级党委在今年一开始就把学习毛主席著作作为首要任务来抓，要求各级领导干部带头学好用好毛泽东思想。
    决定强调指出，毛主席的书是我们一切工作的最高指示。高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装广大干部和人民群众，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是各级党组织的根本任务，也是各级领导干部的首要责任。如果领导干部不认真学习毛泽东思想，不但不能领导好三大革命运动，领导好一般干部和群众的学习，而且在三大革命运动中，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，就会犯错误，以至有迷失方向的危险。
    决定指出，学习毛主席著作，要坚持理论联系实际的原则，活学活用，带着问题学，在“用”字上狠下功夫。通过学习，改造自己的思想，解决工作中的问题。要用毛泽东思想来指导三大革命运动，指导我们的一切实际工作。要在社会主义教育运动中，活学活用毛泽东思想，去教育干部、武装群众。要用毛泽东思想提高广大群众的觉悟，有力地推动增产节约运动，完成第三个五年计划，赶上和超过世界科学技术的先进水平。要用毛泽东思想去推动意识形态领域里的兴无灭资斗争。
    决定要求各级干部，在今年一年内，精读、通读《毛泽东著作选读》和《毛主席语录》。还要挤出时间通读《毛泽东选集》第一至第四卷和毛主席其他著作，有条件的还可以选读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。
    市委决定下达以后，广大干部热烈拥护，全市正在掀起一个学习毛主席著作的热潮。
    二十二日，上海《解放日报》发表社论指出：上海全市各级干部学习毛主席著作有了一个新的开端。现在，重要的在于各级领导认真抓紧，活学活用，并且长期坚持下去。能不能坚持，关键在于领导。过去有些同志学不好，常常强调工作忙。革命工作总是忙的。工作重要，学习毛主席著作更重要。不学习，工作搞不好，会成为白忙，甚至反而误事。任务越重，工作越忙，就越要认真学毛主席著作。我们一定要狠下决心，抱着为中国革命和世界革命以及自我改造的强烈要求和愿望刻苦学习。
