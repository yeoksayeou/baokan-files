    Vietnamese "People's Daily" Points Out That U.S. Imperialism Cannot Escape an Even More Disastrous Defeat
    The Vietnamese People Are Full of Confidence in Striving for Greater Victory This Year; They Are Determined to Persist in a Long-Term Struggle to Defeat the American Robbers
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 1st (Dispatch) The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on January 1st, stating that no matter how many troops U.S. imperialism increases and to whatever dangerous level it escalates the war, the Vietnamese people are fully equipped with all the strength needed to defeat the American invading robbers.
    The editorial, entitled "Concentrate All Efforts to Defeat the American Invading Robbers," said that 1965 was a year of great victory for our people and great defeat for the American aggressors. 1966 will certainly be a year of even greater victory for our people, and it will certainly be a year in which U.S. imperialism cannot escape even more disastrous defeat. Our people's anti-American struggle for national salvation is advancing towards complete victory with steady and powerful steps.
    The editorial said that we, the Vietnamese people, are experiencing a period of earth-shattering revolutionary struggle to defeat the number one imperialist aggressor, liberate the South, defend the North, and then unify the motherland, completing the historical task of national and people's democratic revolution throughout the country. We are waging a people's revolutionary war that is broader and deeper than any in our history. Our entire people are uniting as one, taking up arms, and resisting the invaders. The victories achieved by the military and civilians in both North and South Vietnam in 1965 have extremely important political and military significance. The so-called American "air superiority" has been smashed to pieces like the wreckage of nearly 850 American planes shot down in the North. The Southern revolutionary armed forces have gained and consolidated the initiative on all battlefields. The enemy is increasingly falling into a passive position strategically. The 180,000 American troops thrown onto the battlefield have fallen into the vast ocean of our people's war. The more the American aggressors increase their troops and intensify the war, the more they suffer disastrous defeats and encounter more new difficulties. When they massively increase their troops, it is also the time when American and puppet troops are frequently attacked in various places. Their difficulties in terms of troop numbers, logistics, finance, and command are becoming increasingly serious. Their fundamental political difficulties are also comprehensively and prominently exposed. They are like a tiger trapped in the mud, baring their teeth and roaring, but unable to escape from the mud.
    The editorial said that the situation we are in is the situation of a heroic nation as the victor. We fight when we say we will fight, and we win every time we fight. A high tide of anti-American resistance for national salvation is surging from north to south throughout our country. The various forces of our people's sacred patriotic struggle are rapidly growing stronger. We have experience in defeating puppet troops, and we also have experience in defeating American troops on the ground and in the air. Defeating the American invading robbers is the sacred task of our more than 30 million compatriots. We are determined to concentrate all our efforts to defeat the American robbers, complete the cause of liberating the motherland, and forever eliminate the barbaric colonial shackles from all the territories of our country.
    The editorial said that our people's anti-American struggle for national salvation is an integral part of the worldwide struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism. The international situation is very favorable to our people's just struggle and unfavorable to the invaders. A united front of world people supporting our people against U.S. imperialism has been formed. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are opposed and condemned by the people of the world. They are suffering defeats in many places, and their strength is declining. The dirty war of aggression they are waging in Vietnam is consuming a large amount of their manpower and material resources, and is exposing their weaknesses. They are clearly not terrifying. On a global scale, U.S. imperialism is in a position of defense and defeat. The forces of world socialism, national independence, peace, and democracy are constantly growing stronger and are in a position of offense.
    The editorial said that U.S. imperialism is failing and deeply mired, but it has not abandoned its aggressive ambitions. The American warmongers are clamoring to intensify the war of aggression and are releasing many hypocritical "peace negotiation" arguments, attempting to deceive public opinion and cover up their war adventure actions. Our people must be vigilant, persist in a long-term struggle, until complete victory.
    The editorial concluded by saying that our people have waged decades of struggle for their freedom and independence. If necessary, we will resolutely continue to fight for decades until we completely defeat the American aggressors, to liberate the South, defend the North, and then unify the motherland, to realize a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and to contribute to safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    越《人民报》指出美帝一定逃脱不了更惨重失败
    越南人民满怀信心争取今年更大胜利   决心全力坚持长期斗争打败美国强盗
    新华社河内一日电　越南《人民报》一日发表社论说，不管美帝国主义增加多少军队和把战争升到如何危险的一级，越南人民充分具备了战胜美国侵略强盗所需要的一切力量。
    这篇题为《集中全力战胜美国侵略强盗》的社论说，一九六五年是我国人民大胜利、美国侵略者大失败的一年。一九六六年必定是我国人民取得更大胜利的一年，也必定是美帝国主义逃脱不了更惨重失败的一年。我国人民的抗美救国斗争正以稳健和有力的步伐向着完全的胜利前进。
    社论说，我们越南人民正在经历惊天动地的革命斗争时期，以打败头号帝国主义侵略者，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国，在全国范围内完成民族和人民民主革命的历史任务。我们正在进行着我国历史上从未有过的广泛和深刻的人民革命战争。我们全民正在团结一致，拿起武器，抗击侵略者。我国北方和南方军民一九六五年所取得的胜利，在政治上和军事上有着极其重大的意义。所谓的美国“空中优势”，象在北方被击落的近八百五十架美国飞机的残骸一样被打得粉碎。南方革命武装力量在各个战场上取得并巩固了主动权。敌军在战略上日益陷入被动，投到战场上的十八万美军，落入了我们人民战争的汪洋大海中，美国侵略者越增加军队和强化战争，就越遭到惨重的失败和碰到更多新的困难。当它们大举增兵的时候，也就是美军和伪军在各地遭到频繁打击的时候。它们在军队数量、后勤、财政和指挥等方面的困难，日益严重地暴露出来。它们在政治上的基本困难也全面突出地暴露出来。它们象陷入泥潭的老虎一样，张牙舞爪和咆哮，但是无法从泥潭里摆脱出来。
    社论说，我们所处的形势，是一个英雄民族所处的战胜者的形势。我们说打就打，每打必胜。一个抗美救国的高潮正在从北到南的我国各地轰轰烈烈地掀起。我国人民神圣的爱国斗争的各方面力量正在飞速地壮大。我们有战胜伪军的经验，同时也有战胜地上和空中的美军的经验。战胜美国侵略强盗是我们三千多万同胞的神圣任务。我们决心集中全力战胜美国强盗，完成解放祖国的事业，在我国全部领土上永远取消野蛮的殖民主义枷锁。
    社论说，我国人民的抗美救国斗争，是全世界争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义斗争的一个组成部分。国际形势非常有利于我国人民的正义斗争，而不利于侵略者。一个世界人民支持我国人民反对美帝国主义的统一阵线已经形成。美帝国主义及其仆从遭到全世界人民的反对和谴责，它们正在许多地方遭到失败，它们的力量正在衰落。它们在越南进行的肮脏侵略战争正使它们消耗大量的人力物力，并且暴露了它们的弱点。它们显然并不可怕。在全世界范围内，美帝国主义正处在防御和失败的地位。世界社会主义、民族独立、和平和民主力量不断壮大，并且处在进攻的地位。
    社论说，美帝国主义正在失败和深陷泥沼，但还没有放弃它的侵略野心。美国战争狂人正在叫嚣强化侵略战争，并且放出许多“和平谈判”的虚伪论调，妄图欺骗舆论，掩盖它们的战争冒险行动。我国人民必须提高警惕，坚持长期斗争，直到完全胜利。
    社论最后说，我国人民为了争取自己的自由和独立，曾经进行了几十年的斗争，如果需要的话，我们将坚决再继续战斗几十年，直到完全打败美国侵略者，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国，实现一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南，为保卫东南亚和世界的和平作出贡献。
