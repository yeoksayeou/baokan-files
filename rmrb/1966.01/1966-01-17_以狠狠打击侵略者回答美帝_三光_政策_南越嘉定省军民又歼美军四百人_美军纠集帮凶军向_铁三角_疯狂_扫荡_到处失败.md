    In response to the US imperialists' "Three Alls" policy, we must strike the aggressors fiercely.
    South Vietnamese Gia Dinh Province's Military and Civilians Annihilate Another 400 American Soldiers
    US Troops Gather Accomplice Troops for Frantic "Mopping-Up" Operations in the "Iron Triangle," Failing Everywhere
    HANOI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- According to the Vietnam Southern Liberation Radio, initial reports indicate that from January 8th to 11th, the People's Armed Forces of Gia Dinh Province in South Vietnam, during counter-"mopping-up" operations in the northern area of Cu Chi District, annihilated a total of 417 American aggressors, shot down or damaged 26 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or damaged 11 enemy M-113 armored vehicles.

    Beginning on the 8th, the American aggressor troops, along with Australian and New Zealand accomplice troops, mobilized more than 8,000 soldiers to launch a large-scale "mopping-up" operation in the northern area of Cu Chi District, attempting to expand the area around the Zhonghe military base and the Fuli Airport.

    In the week preceding the "mopping-up" operation, the American bandits dispatched hundreds of aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, to drop dozens of tons of bombs on Phu My Hung, An Phu, Run De, Xi An Ren, and Dong An Ren townships.

    The local guerrillas were filled with righteous indignation and dealt the invading enemies a heavy blow.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, January 15, Saigon dispatch: The US military's 1st Infantry Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, and Marine Corps in South Vietnam have launched large-scale "mopping-up" operations in the South Vietnamese liberated areas since the beginning of this year, dividing their forces into several routes, but they have all failed.

    According to Western news agencies, since the US 1st Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade's more than 8,000 aggressor troops and Australian accomplice troops launched the largest "mopping-up" operation against the "Iron Triangle" area northwest of Saigon on the 8th, they have been constantly subjected to fierce attacks by the liberation armed forces in the northern area of Cu Chi District. On the 14th, they had to "stop" their "mopping-up" operation and hurriedly withdraw from this area, which made them shudder and was like a dagger inserted into their hearts.

    During this "mopping-up" operation, these inhumane aggressor troops repeatedly used poison gas on a large scale to massacre the Vietnamese people. Before withdrawing from the "Iron Triangle" area, they also went on a rampage, frantically releasing poison gas into the tunnels they found.

    While invading the "Iron Triangle" area, the US 1st Cavalry Division dispatched several battalions in the Central Highlands to conduct "mopping-up" operations west of Bo Lai Gu and on the Vietnam-Cambodia border. However, these US aggressor troops, touted as "highly mobile," ran around aimlessly for more than ten days, achieving nothing. They had to admit that this "mopping-up" operation was "even less successful" than the "mopping-up" of the "Iron Triangle."

    The "mopping-up" operation conducted by 6,000 US Marines and South Vietnamese puppet troops in the area 32 kilometers south of Da Nang since the 12th also repeatedly failed.

    以狠狠打击侵略者回答美帝“三光”政策
    南越嘉定省军民又歼美军四百人
    美军纠集帮凶军向“铁三角”疯狂“扫荡”到处失败
    据新华社河内十五日电  据越南南方解放电台报道：据初步消息，越南南方嘉定省人民武装八日到十一日在古芝县北面地区反“扫荡”战斗中，共歼灭美国侵略者四百一十七名，打落打伤敌机二十六架，击毁击坏敌人M—113型装甲车十一辆。
    八日起，美国侵略军伙同澳大利亚和新西兰帮凶军，出动八千多名兵力向古芝县北面地区发动大规模“扫荡”，妄图扩大中和军事基地和富利机场一带地区。
    美国强盗在进行“扫荡”的前一个星期内出动数以百计的飞机，其中包括B—52型战略轰炸机向富美兴、安富、润德、西安仁和东安仁等乡扔下了几十吨炸弹。
    当地游击队的战士们义愤填膺，给来犯的敌人狠狠的打击。
    据新华社十五日讯　西贡消息：侵越美军第一步兵师、第一七三空降旅、第一骑兵师和海军陆战队，今年以来分兵数路，疯狂向越南南方解放区发动大规模“扫荡”，但是全都遭到失败。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国第一步兵师和一七三空降旅的八千多名侵略军以及澳大利亚帮凶军八日起对西贡西北“铁三角”地带发动规模最大的“扫荡”以来，在古芝县北部地区不断遭到解放武装力量的猛烈袭击。十四日不得不“停止”他们的“扫荡”，慌张撤出这个使他们心惊胆战象一把匕首那样插入他们心脏的地区。
    在这次“扫荡”中，这些灭绝人性的侵略军曾经多次大规模使用毒气屠杀越南人民。在撤出“铁三角”地带前，他们还大发兽性，疯狂地向他们所发现的地道施放了毒气。
    在进犯“铁三角”地带的同时，美国第一骑兵师在中部高原出动几个营的兵力，向波来古以西、越南—柬埔寨边境进行“扫荡”。但是，这些被吹嘘为“高度机动”的美国侵略军东奔西跑，找了十来天，一无所获，不得不承认这次“扫荡”比“扫荡”“铁三角”“更不成功”。
    六千名美国海军陆战队和南越伪军十二日起在岘港南面三十二公里的地带进行的“扫荡”也连连扑空。
