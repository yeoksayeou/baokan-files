    My Foreign Ministry Refutes Indian Slander and Vilification
    Solemn Revelation: The Indian government's recent frantic use of armed means to create tensions on the border and its launching of a rumor machine to slander China are aimed at begging for aid from U.S. imperialism and its accomplices to cope with the increasingly severe domestic food shortage and the needs of expanding its military and preparing for war.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 7th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on the 6th, sent a note to the Indian Embassy in China, refuting the rumors fabricated by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in six notes between November 27th and December 13th, 1965, to slander China, and resolutely rejecting the unreasonable protests raised by the Indian side based on these rumors.
    The note pointed out that the Indian government's recent frantic use of armed means to create tension on the Sino-Indian border and the Sino-Sikkimese border is entirely for the needs of its current domestic and foreign policies. The note once again solemnly told the Indian government that if the Indian side continues to carry out intrusions and provocations against China, the Chinese side will resolutely strike back. If the Indian side continues to spread rumors and slander China, and even vainly attempts to slander China by using the measures taken by China to ease the tension, it can only further expose the disgraceful acts of the Indian government.
    The note said that in the six notes from November 27th to December 13th, 1965, the Indian government fabricated a series of rumors about China's "invasion" activities against India, slandered China for creating tension and conflict on the Sino-Indian border and the China-Sikkim border, and based on this, constantly lodged "protests" to China. The Chinese government expresses its indignation at this and resolutely rejects these unreasonable protests.
    The note said that Chinese border defense personnel and civil affairs personnel, whether on the Sino-Indian border or the Sino-Sikkimese border, have not crossed the line of actual control and the boundary line. The Indian government's accusations of so-called Chinese invasion in its notes are all deliberately fabricated lies and have no factual basis.
    Regarding the eastern sector of the Sino-Indian border, the Indian side accused Chinese personnel of "invading" places such as Sangyam Pass, Siyongla Pass, Korpala Pass, and Sandorong Chu ridge. First of all, the Chinese government has no idea where the Sangyam Pass and Siyongla Pass mentioned by the Indian side are located. The confluence of the Nyangjang Chu River and the Sandorong River south of the so-called Sandorong Chu ridge is located north of Che Dong, clearly on the Chinese side of the line of actual control. As for the claim that Chinese personnel crossed the Korpala Pass on the afternoon of November 27th, 1965, to "attack" an Indian police team and "injure" an Indian policeman's arm, it is purely fabricated and not worth refuting. Particularly absurd is the Indian side's attack on the Chinese army for entering the Longju and Che Dong areas, claiming that China "destroyed the long-established Indian border in the eastern sector." It has long been proven that Longju has always been part of the Maja Tun area of Tibet and is located north of the Sino-Indian border line of actual control. Che Dong has always been under the jurisdiction of Lecun in Cona County, Tibet, and even according to the original map of the illegal McMahon Line of 1914, it is on the Chinese side north of the line. The Indian government's repeated mention of Longju and Che Dong, and its claim that the illegal McMahon Line is the Sino-Indian eastern border line, can only expose its expansionist ambitions towards Chinese territory. The Chinese government once again solemnly informs the Indian government that this McMahon Line is illegal and has never been recognized by the Chinese side. The 90,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory south of the McMahon Line is still illegally occupied by the Indian side, and the Chinese government will always reserve the right to resolve this issue.
    Regarding the western sector of the Sino-Indian border, the large pile of so-called Chinese "invasion" incidents listed by the Indian side all accuse Chinese personnel of entering the Doulat Beg Oldi area. In fact, the Chinese side has never crossed its own border line, let alone entered the Indian side's Doulat Beg Oldi area.
    As for the Sino-Sikkimese border, the Chinese government clearly pointed out in its note of December 26, 1959: The Sino-Sikkimese border has long been formally delineated, there is no disagreement in map drawing, and there is no dispute in reality. China has always respected Sikkim's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has never crossed the Sino-Sikkimese border. On the contrary, the Indian troops stationed in Sikkim have continuously crossed the Sino-Sikkimese border since 1960, intruded into Chinese territory, and built a large number of aggressive fortifications on Chinese territory. It was only in September 1965, when the Chinese government gave the Indian side a deadline to dismantle these aggressive fortifications, that the invading Indian troops fled in a hurry. However, after that, the Indian troops returned and continued to cross the border for reconnaissance, and even launched armed attacks on Chinese border defense personnel. It is clear that it is India that is using Sikkim's territory to continuously carry out intrusions and provocations against China, creating tension on the Sino-Sikkimese border. No matter how many lies the Indian government fabricates, it cannot cover up this ironclad fact.
    The note said that the Indian government also nonsensically claimed that China "openly defied the provisions of the Colombo proposals and denied its own ceasefire declaration." The Indian government here has precisely shot itself in the foot. As everyone knows, as early as October 24, 1962, the fourth day after India launched a large-scale armed attack on China, the Chinese government issued a statement solemnly suggesting that the armed forces of both China and India should withdraw 20 kilometers each from the line of actual control on the Sino-Indian border. Subsequently, the Chinese side unilaterally withdrew, and left vacant the areas disputed by both sides in the ceasefire arrangement, without even establishing civil affairs stations. This series of measures taken by the Chinese side far exceeded the requirements of the Colombo proposals. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that China took these measures proactively entirely to ease border tensions and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the border issue. At the same time, the Chinese government also declared that it reserves the right to self-defense and requires the Indian side to correctly understand China's peaceful efforts, make a positive response, and must not use China's unilateral actions to carry out intrusions and provocations. However, what are the facts? The Indian side not only did not make the slightest response to China's conciliatory measures, but instead used China's proactive withdrawal to intensify its intrusions and provocations against China, creating tension. From November 1962, when China implemented a proactive ceasefire on the Sino-Indian border, to September 1965, in less than three years, the Indian army's ground and air intrusions reached more than 300 incidents. Under such rampant intrusions and provocations by the Indian side, the Chinese side is fully entitled to take all necessary self-defense measures. To be honest, it is absolutely impossible for the Indian government to allow itself to unscrupulously intensify armed intrusions and create border incidents, while not allowing China to strengthen its vigilance and take necessary defensive measures on its own territory.
    The note said, it must be pointed out that the Indian government's recent frantic use of armed means to create tension on the Sino-Indian border and the Sino-Sikkimese border is entirely for the needs of its current domestic and foreign policies. The facts of the past few years have shown that whenever the Indian government needs to beg for aid from U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, it intensifies its intrusions against China, creates tension, and launches a rumor machine to slander China. The current intensification of the Indian government's intrusion activities against China is precisely to cope with the increasingly severe domestic food shortage and the needs of expanding its military and preparing for war.
    The note concluded by saying that the Chinese government once again solemnly tells the Indian government: If the Indian side continues to carry out intrusions and provocations against China, and even launches armed attacks against Chinese border defense personnel again, the Chinese side will resolutely strike back. If the Indian side continues to spread rumors and slander China, and even vainly attempts to slander China by using the measures taken by China to ease the tension, it will not harm China in the slightest, but will only further expose the disgraceful acts of the Indian government.

### 我外交部驳斥印方造谣诬蔑

    我外交部驳斥印方造谣诬蔑
    严正揭露：印度政府最近疯狂地采用武装手段制造边界紧张局势，并开动造谣机器大肆诬蔑中国，是为了向美帝国主义及其合伙者乞求援助，应付国内日益严重的粮荒和扩军备战的需要。
    新华社七日讯　中华人民共和国外交部六日照会印度驻华大使馆，驳斥印度外交部在一九六五年十一月二十七日到十二月十三日之间的六个来照中编造谣言诬蔑中国，并且断然拒绝印度方面根据这些谣言提出的无理抗议。
    照会指出，印度政府最近疯狂地采用武装手段在中印边界和中锡边界制造紧张局势，完全是为了它当前内政和外交的需要。照会再一次严正地告诉印度政府，如果印度方面继续对中国进行入侵挑衅，中国方面将坚决给予回击。如果印度方面继续对中国造谣诬蔑，甚至妄想利用中国为缓和紧张局势所采取的措施诽谤中国，只能进一步暴露印度政府的不光彩行径。
    照会说，印度政府在一九六五年十一月二十七日到十二月十三日的六个照会中，编造了一大套中国对印度进行“入侵”活动的谣言，诬蔑中国在中印边界和中国—锡金边界制造紧张和冲突，并据此向中国不断提出“抗议”。中国政府对此表示愤慨，并且断然拒绝这些无理抗议。
    照会说，中国边防人员和民政人员不论在中印边界还是在中锡边界，都没有越过双方实际控制线和边界线。印度政府在来照中对中国方面所谓入侵的指控，全部是有意捏造的谎言，毫无事实根据。
    关于中印边界东段，印方指责中国人员越过桑山口、西翁拉山口、更巴拉山口和桑多洛山脊等地方进行“入侵”。首先，中国政府根本不知道印方所说的桑山口和西翁拉山口在什么地方。所谓桑多洛山脊以南的娘江曲河同桑多洛河的汇合处，则位于沙则以北，显然在实际控制线中国一侧。至于说中国人员在一九六五年十一月二十七日下午越过更巴拉山口，“袭击”印度警察队，并且
  “打伤”一名印度警察的手臂，更是凭空捏造，根本不值一驳。特别荒谬的是，印方还攻击中国军队进入朗久和扯冬地区，说什么中国“破坏了在东段久已确定的印度国界”。早经证明，朗久历来是西藏马及墩地区的一部分，位于中印边界实际控制线以北。扯冬则一直属于西藏错那县勒村所管辖，即使按照一九一四年非法的麦克马洪线原图，也在线北中国一侧。印度政府又一次提到朗久和扯冬，并且把非法的麦克马洪线称之为中印东段边界线，这只能暴露它对中国领土的扩张野心。中国政府再次正告印度政府，这条麦克马洪线是非法的，中国方面从来就不承认。麦克马洪线以南的九万平方公里的中国领土，至今还被印方非法霸占着，中国政府永远保留解决这个问题的权利。
    关于中印边界西段，印方罗列的一大堆所谓中国“入侵”的事例，都是指责中国人员进入了斗拉特别奥里地地区。事实上，中国方面从来没有越过自己的边界线，更没有进入印方的斗拉特别奥里地地区。
    至于中锡边界，中国政府早在一九五九年十二月二十六日的照会中就明确指出：中锡边界早经正式划定，在地图画法上既没有分歧，在实际上也没有纠纷。中国一向尊重锡金的主权和领土完整，从未越过中锡边界。相反的，倒是驻扎在锡金的印度军队，从一九六○年以来，不断越过中锡边界，侵入中国境内，并且在中国领土上构筑了大批侵略工事。只是在一九六五年九月中国政府限期印度方面拆除这些侵略工事的情况下，入侵印军才仓惶撤走。但是，在此之后，印军又卷土重来，仍然不断越界侦察，甚至向中国边防人员发动武装进攻。事情很清楚，正是印度利用锡金领土不断向中国进行入侵挑衅，制造中锡边界紧张局势。不管印度政府捏造多少谎言，都不能掩盖这一铁的事实。
    照会说，印度政府在来照中还胡说什么中国“公开违抗了科伦坡建议的规定和否定了中国自己的停火声明”。印度政府在这里恰好搬起石头砸了自己的脚。众所周知，早在一九六二年十月二十四日，即印度向中国发动大规模武装进攻的第四天，中国政府就发表声明，郑重建议中印双方武装部队自中印边界实际控制线各自后撤二十公里。其后，中国方面即单方面地进行后撤，并且空出双方在停火安排中有争议的地区，连民政站也未设立。中国方面的这一系列措施，远远超过了科伦坡建议的要求。中国政府曾屡次声明，中国主动采取这些措施完全是为了缓和边境紧张局势和便于和平解决边界问题。同时，中国政府还声明保留进行自卫的权利，并且要求印度方面正确理解中国方面的和平努力，作出积极的响应，绝不能利用中国单方面的行动进行入侵挑衅。然而，事实是怎样的呢？印度方面不仅对中国方面的和缓措施没有作出丝毫的响应，反而利用中国方面的主动后撤加紧对中国进行入侵挑衅，制造紧张局势。从一九六二年十一月中国在中印边境实行主动停火至一九六五年九月止，在不到三年的时间内，印军的地面和空中入侵竟达三百多起。在印方这种猖狂入侵挑衅的情况下，中国方面完全有权采取一切必要的自卫措施。老实说，印度政府只准它自己肆无忌惮地加紧武装入侵和制造边境事件，不准中国在自己的领土上加强戒备和采取必要的防御措施，是绝对办不到的。
    照会说，必须指出，印度政府最近疯狂地采用武装手段在中印边界和中锡边界制造紧张局势，完全是为了它当前内政和外交的需要。几年来的事实表明，印度政府什么时候需要向美帝国主义及其合伙者乞求援助，什么时候就加紧对中国入侵，制造紧张，并且开动造谣机器大肆诬蔑中国。目前印度政府加紧对中国的入侵活动，正是为了应付国内日益严重的粮荒和扩军备战的需要。
    照会最后说，中国政府再一次严正地告诉印度政府：如果印度方面继续对中国进行入侵挑衅，甚而再次向中国边防人员发动武装进攻，中国方面将坚决给予回击。如果印度方面继续对中国造谣诬蔑，甚至妄想利用中国为缓和紧张局势所采取的措施诽谤中国，那根本损害不了中国的一根毫毛，只能进一步暴露印度政府的不光彩行径。
