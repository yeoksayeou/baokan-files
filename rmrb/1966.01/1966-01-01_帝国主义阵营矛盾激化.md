    In 1965, the profound contradictions between imperialist countries were further intensified, and the situation of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization saw new developments.

    The struggle for control and anti-control between the United States and France has developed into a sharp confrontation on a global scale. Contradictions between the United States and other Western European countries, and among Western European countries themselves, have also further developed. This has made the imperialist camp even more mired in a chaotic situation of disintegration.

    The demand for a thorough reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a firm resistance to the U.S. policy of nuclear control over Western Europe remains the focus of France's struggle with the United States. In order to revive the stillborn "Multilateral Nuclear Force" plan to control Western Europe, the United States proposed the establishment of a "Nuclear Special Committee" of the North Atlantic Group last May. However, this plan, which attempts to use roundabout methods to carry out nuclear control over Western Europe, has, like the past, been resisted by France and met with indifference from other Western European countries. France has further taken counter-measures, proposing the reorganization of the North Atlantic Group and the abolition of the U.S. hegemonic status. Coupled with the contradictions between other member states, the tendency for this most important aggressive military bloc in the imperialist camp to fall apart is becoming increasingly obvious.

    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, pieced together by the United States, is also in a state of paralysis due to France's dismantling efforts. Last May, in order to drag others into expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the United States held a ministerial council of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in London; France not only refused to send representatives to attend, but also declared in advance that it would not be bound by the conference communiqué.

    The economic contradictions between the United States and Western European countries are also intensifying. Taking advantage of the unstable position of the U.S. dollar, France has proposed a thorough revision of the current international monetary system that gives the U.S. dollar special privileges, while also using large amounts of U.S. dollars to redeem gold; other countries have followed suit, and the United States lost more than ten times as much gold last year as it did the year before. At the same time, the shrinking of the capitalist world market and the large-scale invasion of Western Europe by U.S. capital have intensified the struggle between imperialist countries for markets, raw material producing areas, and investment sites on an unprecedented scale.

    Within Western European countries, divisions have also begun to appear. The contradictions between the West German Erhard government, which implements a pro-American line, and France have continued to deepen, which has even paralyzed the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries. In this situation, other Western European countries also have their own plans, forming a complex situation.

    In this new year, the contradictions within the imperialist camp will further develop. As the strength of U.S. imperialism weakens, its hegemonic position in the Western world will inevitably become more shaky. The disintegration of the imperialist camp is inevitable.

    帝国主义阵营矛盾激化
    一九六五年，是帝国主义国家之间的深刻矛盾更加激化、大动荡、大分化、大改组局面又有了新的发展的一年。
    美国和法国的控制和反控制斗争，已发展成为全球性的尖锐对抗。在美国和其它西欧国家之间，在西欧国家相互之间矛盾也有了进一步发展。这就使帝国主义阵营更加陷入分崩离析的混乱局面。
    要求彻底改组北大西洋公约组织，并坚决抵制美国对西欧的核控制政策，仍然是法国同美国斗争的焦点。美国为了使控制西欧的“多边核力量”计划死胎复活，去年五月提出成立北大西洋集团“核特别委员会”的建议。但是，这个企图用迂回手法来对西欧进行核控制的计划，仍然和过去一样，受到法国的抗拒和其它西欧国家的冷淡。法国还进一步采取反击行动，提出改组北大西洋集团、取消美国霸主地位的要求。再加上其它成员国之间的矛盾，目前这个帝国主义阵营的最重要的侵略性军事集团四分五裂的趋势已经越来越明显。
    美国一手拼凑的东南亚集团，由于法国的拆台，也处于瘫痪状态中。去年五月，美国为了拖人下水来扩大侵越战争，在伦敦举行了东南亚集团部长理事会；法国不但拒绝派代表出席，而且事先就声明，将不受会议公报的约束。
    美国同西欧国家的经济矛盾也日益激化，法国利用美元地位不稳的情况，提出要彻底修改让美元享受特权的现行国际货币制度，同时大量用美元挤兑黄金；其他国家也群起效尤，美国去年流失黄金比前年流失总额多十几倍。与此同时，资本主义世界市场的缩小和美国资本的大举入侵西欧，使帝国主义国家争夺市场、原料产地和投资场所的斗争，更加以空前激烈的规模进行。
    西欧国家内部，分化也开始出现。执行亲美路线的西德艾哈德政府和法国之间矛盾不断加深，这甚至已经使西欧六国的“共同市场”陷于瘫痪。在这种情况下，西欧其它国家也都各有打算，形成了一种错综复杂的局面。
    在这新的一年中，帝国主义阵营的矛盾还将进一步发展。随着美帝国主义力量的削弱，它在西方世界的霸主地位必然要更加动摇。帝国主义阵营的四分五裂是不可避免的。
