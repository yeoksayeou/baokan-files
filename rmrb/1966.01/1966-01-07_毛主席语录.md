    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    "There are many things that, if we fall into blindness towards them and lack awareness, can become our burdens and liabilities. For example, having made mistakes can make a person feel that since they have made mistakes anyway, they will become dejected from then on; not having made mistakes can also make a person feel that they have not made mistakes, and become arrogant from then on. Having no achievements in work can make a person pessimistic and dispirited; having achievements in work can make a person conceited. Those with a short history of struggle can be irresponsible because of its brevity; those with a long history of struggle can be self-righteous because of its length."
        《放下包袱，开动机器》 ("Get Rid of the Baggage and Start Up the Machinery")

    毛主席语录
    “有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。例如：犯过错误，可以使人觉得自己反正是犯了错误的，从此萎靡不振；未犯错误，也可以使人觉得自己是未犯过错误的，从此骄傲起来。工作无成绩，可以使人悲观丧气；工作有成绩，又可以使人趾高气扬。斗争历史短的，可以因其短而不负责任；斗争历史长的，可以因其长而自以为是。”
