    Brief Comments
    Adding Fuel to the Fire
    The American aggressors and the South Vietnamese puppet regime are about to implement a "new pacification plan" to tighten their control over the South Vietnamese countryside. They plan to send some agents trained by the American Central Intelligence Agency to the rural areas to conduct individual "interrogations" of residents and "investigate the causes of dissatisfaction." It is said that the US-puppet authorities believe that doing so can win the war that they cannot win with "bombs and bullets."
    Do the extensive masses of people in South Vietnam need to be asked what the reasons are for their dissatisfaction with the American aggressors and their running dogs? The so-called "investigation of the causes of dissatisfaction" is false; the real aim is to suppress and persecute the common people. Obviously, this kind of fascist rule will arouse the dissatisfaction and hatred of the broad masses of the people. The US-puppet’s "new pacification plan" can only add fuel to the fire.
    Reversing Black and White
    American "roving ambassador" Harriman said: The South Vietnam National Liberation Front "does not represent the Southern people," while the Saigon puppet regime "has gained the united support of the people."
    Harriman's absurd remarks of reversing black and white are truly laughable. It would be best to let the famous American commentator Walter Lippmann refute him. Lippmann said: "There is almost no reason to believe that the Saigon military and politicians can form a government that will gain the support and trust of the Vietnamese people."
    No Need to Be Modest
    The US House of Representatives summoned some "China experts" to testify in order to study its aggression policy. It is said that these "experts" believe that one of the "major stumbling blocks hindering the United States from implementing an effective policy in Asia" is that the United States "has no experience in dealing with a 'China that has rolled up its sleeves and is united as one.'"
    This statement is somewhat overly modest. American imperialism has competed with the Chinese people on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. How can it be said that it has no experience in dealing with the Chinese people? However, for the American ruling class, these are all experiences of failure.
    However, these "experts" view the united Chinese people as a "major stumbling block" for American imperialism in pursuing its policy of aggression in Asia, and this point is correct.

    三言两语
    火上加油
    美国侵略者和南越傀儡政权要推行一个加紧控制南越乡村的“新绥靖计划”。他们准备派出一些经过美国中央情报局训练的特务，到农村去对居民进行逐个“讯问”，向他们“调查不满原因”。据说，美伪当局认为这样做就可以赢得他们靠“炸弹和枪弹”所不能赢得的战争。
    南越广大人民对美国侵略者及其走狗不满的原因，还用得着调查吗？所谓“调查不满原因”是假的，对老百姓进行钳制和迫害才是真的。很显然，他们这种法西斯的统治手段，必将激起广大人民的不满和仇恨。美伪的“新绥靖计划”只能是火上加油。
    颠倒黑白
    美国的“巡回大使”哈里曼说：越南南方民族解放阵线“不代表南方人民”，而西贡的傀儡政权“取得了人民联合的支持”。
    哈里曼这种颠倒黑白的胡言乱语实在可笑。最好让美国著名评论员李普曼批驳他。李普曼说过：“几乎没有理由相信西贡军人和政客能够组成一个会得到越南人民支持和信任的政府”。
    何必谦虚
    美国众议院为了研究侵略政策，召集了一些“中国问题专家”出席作证。据说，这些“专家”认为“妨碍美国在亚洲执行有效的政策的重要绊脚石”之一是，美国“对‘挽起袖子团结一致的中国’没有同它打交道的经验”。
    这种说法未免过谦了。美帝国主义同中国人民在战场上，在谈判桌上都较量过，怎能说是没有同中国人民打交道的经验呢？不过对美国统治集团来说，都是一些失败的经验罢了。
    然而，这些“专家”们把团结一致的中国人民看成是美帝国主义在亚洲推行侵略政策的“重要绊脚石”，这一点倒是不错的。
