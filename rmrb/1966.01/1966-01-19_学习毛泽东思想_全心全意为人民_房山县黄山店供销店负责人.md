    The film "Red Back Basket" has created an image of Wang Fushan, an advanced socialist commercial worker who is based at the counter, has the whole country in mind, and has the world in view. He loves socialist commerce, loves the people in the mountainous areas, and is full of enthusiasm for supporting the construction of the mountainous areas. In order to promote the development of production and the improvement of people's lives in the mountainous areas, he is willing to endure great hardship and hard work, and be a "silly cow." Regardless of wind and rain, regardless of the scorching sun, and not afraid of dangerous mountain roads, he insists on carrying the industrial products produced by the state for the people in the mountainous areas up the mountain, and carrying the local and special products of the mountainous people supporting socialist construction down the mountain.
    Why is Wang Fushan able to do this? The most fundamental reason is that he connects his daily work with the revolution and with serving the people, insists on studying Chairman Mao's works, and finds his position, viewpoints, and methods from Chairman Mao's teachings. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, he understood that in order to seek benefits for the masses, he must solve all the problems of the masses, and he understood that the responsibility of understanding the world and transforming the world falls on the shoulders of the great Communist Party and Communist Party members. In this way, he has the will and perseverance to overcome any difficulties.
    Therefore, if we want to learn from Wang Fushan's spirit, we must start by studying Chairman Mao's works. We must adhere to studying with problems in mind, studying and applying it in a lively manner, combining study and application, and focusing on the application. We must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, and carry forward the red back basket—the proletarian revolutionary spirit.
    "Red Back Basket" is a good revolutionary film, but the film does not fully expose the contradiction between the two business ideologies and business styles of socialism and capitalism; Wang Fushan focuses on the struggle aspect of Sun's capitalist business ideology and style, while neglecting the aspect of ideological assistance and education, and Sun's transformation also seems sudden. We are not very satisfied with these places.

    学习毛泽东思想  全心全意为人民
    房山县黄山店供销店负责人  王砚香
    《红色背篓》影片为我们塑造了王福山这样一个身在柜台、胸怀全国、放眼世界的社会主义商业先进工作者的形象。他热爱社会主义商业，热爱山区人民，对支援山区建设满怀热情。为了促进山区生产的发展和群众生活的改善，他甘愿吃大苦、耐大劳，做“傻牛”。不管刮风下雨，不顾烈日酷夏，不怕山路险阻，坚持把国家为山区人民生产的工业品背上山，又把山区人民支援社会主义建设的土特产品背下山。
    王福山为什么能够这样做呢？最根本的原因是，他把自己的日常工作同革命、同为人民服务联系起来，坚持学习毛主席著作，从毛主席的教导里找立场、找观点、找方法。他通过学习毛主席著作，才懂得要为群众谋利益，就必须解决群众的一切问题，才懂得认识世界和改造世界的责任，落在了伟大的共产党和共产党员的肩头。这样，他就有了战胜任何困难的意志和毅力。
    因此，我们要学习王福山的精神，就必须从学习毛主席著作入手。要坚持带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，在用字上下功夫，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，把红色的背篓——无产阶级革命精神发扬光大。
    《红色背篓》是一部好的革命电影，但是影片对社会主义与资本主义两种经营思想、经营作风的矛盾揭露得还不够充分；王福山对孙会计的资本主义经营思想作风偏重于斗争的一方面，而忽视从思想上帮助教育的一方面，孙会计的转变也显得突然。对这些地方，我们感到还不十分满足。
