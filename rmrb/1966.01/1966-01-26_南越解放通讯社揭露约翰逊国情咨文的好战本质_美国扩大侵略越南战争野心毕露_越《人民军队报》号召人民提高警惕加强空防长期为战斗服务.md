    South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency Exposes Johnson's State of the Union Address's Belligerent Nature
    U.S. Unveils Ambition to Expand War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Vietnamese "People's Army Daily" Calls on People to Heighten Vigilance, Strengthen Air Defenses, and Serve Combat for the Long Term
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 25th – The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency recently published a commentary exposing the belligerent nature of Johnson's State of the Union address, reiterating the South Vietnamese people's iron will to fight to the end and finally drive out the American aggressors.
    The commentary said that the central intention of Johnson's State of the Union address on January 12th was a sentence he repeatedly mentioned: "We (i.e., the United States) must stay." This means that the American aggressors refuse to withdraw from South Vietnam and force the Vietnamese people to be their slaves; it means that the American aggressors intend to prolong the war and continue to invade Vietnam, despite the many crushing defeats they have already suffered.
    The commentary said that Johnson also made no secret of his ambition to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, constantly clamoring that he "does not intend to abandon Asia," even though Asia has never been the property of U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary, in exposing Johnson's recent "peace talk" trick, said that while Johnson was loudly proclaiming "peaceful intentions," he was also sending more troops to South Vietnam. At the same time, the American bandits also launched large-scale "sweeps" in Long An, Binh Dinh, Quang Nam, Phu Yen, Quang Ngai, Gia Dinh, and many other places, frantically using chemical poisons and gases to massacre the Vietnamese people. In this State of the Union address, Johnson also asked Congress to allocate a large amount of additional military spending as expenses for continuing to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The commentary pointed out that Johnson's State of the Union address also reflects the dilemma of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The fact is that the American aggressors have lost miserably in the war of aggression against Vietnam and are rapidly moving towards complete defeat. However, they still refuse to give up their aggressive ambitions, pinning their hopes on a "victory" that they will never achieve.
    The commentary concluded: "If the aggressors want to 'stay' in South Vietnam, the Vietnamese military and civilians are determined to drive them out."
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 25th – The Vietnamese "People's Army Daily" published an editorial on the 24th calling on the Vietnamese people to further heighten their vigilance, deepen their hatred for the American bandits, and continue to carry out all work that serves combat for the long term.
    The editorial said that currently, the American bandits have suffered heavy military and political defeats in both North and South Vietnam. However, because they are the most cunning and brutal bandits, they will not wake up until their death. Recently, while playing the old trick of "seeking peace," they have successively dispatched B-52 aircraft to barbarously bomb many places in South Vietnam, sent thousands of U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops to conduct "sweeps," burn houses, destroy crops, loot food, and massacre the people extremely barbarously. Towards North Vietnam, they are arrogantly threatening to bomb various industrial and residential areas, and, in order to prepare for a new "gradual escalation," they have successively sent aircraft to conduct extremely blatant reconnaissance. Obviously, the American bandits are not only unwilling to give up their conspiracy of aggression, but are also stepping up efforts to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to a more intense degree.
    The editorial called on the Vietnamese people to continue all work that serves combat for the long term. Among them, the people's air defense work must be given special attention.
    The editorial emphasized that people's air defense is an important part of the people's war and is an aspect of the task of eliminating the enemy and defending ourselves. In order to strive for new victories in the new year, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, while promoting the movement of the whole people to fight American aircraft, the military organs from the province to the township must strengthen leadership, and lead all grassroots units in a timely manner to actively, practically, and meticulously do a good job in people's air defense work.

    南越解放通讯社揭露约翰逊国情咨文的好战本质
    美国扩大侵略越南战争野心毕露
    越《人民军队报》号召人民提高警惕加强空防长期为战斗服务
    新华社河内二十五日电  越南南方解放通讯社最近发表评论，揭露约翰逊国情咨文的好战本质，重申越南南方人民坚决战斗到底和最后赶走美国侵略者的钢铁意志。
    评论说，一月十二日约翰逊发表国情咨文的中心意图就是他本人反复提到的一句话：“我们（即美国）一定要留下来”。这意味着美国侵略者不肯撤出越南南方，强迫越南人民当他们的奴隶；意味着美国侵略者蓄意延长战争，继续侵略越南，尽管他们已经遭到许多惨重的失败。
    评论说，约翰逊也毫不掩饰他扩大侵略越南战争的野心，一味叫嚷“不打算放弃亚洲”，尽管亚洲从来都不是美帝国主义的所有物。
    评论在揭露约翰逊最近玩弄的“和谈”骗局时说，在约翰逊大肆叫嚷“和平诚意”的时候，也就是他向越南南方增派军队的时候。同时，美国强盗还向隆安、平定、广南、富安、广义、嘉定和其他许多地方展开大规模“扫荡”，疯狂地使用化学毒药和毒气残杀越南人民。约翰逊在这个国情咨文中，还要求国会增拨大量军费，作为继续扩大侵越战争的开支。
    评论指出，约翰逊的国情咨文也反映出美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中进退两难的窘境。事实是，美国侵略者在侵越战争中输得很惨，并且迅速走向彻底失败。但是，它仍然不肯放弃侵略野心，把希望寄托在永远得不到的“胜利”上。
    评论最后说：“侵略者要想在南越‘留下来’，越南军民决心把他们撵出去。”
    新华社河内二十五日电越南《人民军队报》二十四日发表社论，号召越南人民必须更加提高警惕，加深对美国强盗的仇恨，继续进行长期为战斗服务的一切工作。
    社论说，目前，美国强盗在越南南北两方在军事和政治上都遭到惨重的失败。但是，由于他们是最狡猾、最残暴的强盗，所以，他们是至死不悟的。最近，他们在大肆玩弄“谋求和平”的老把戏的同时，在越南南方接连出动B—52型飞机向许多地方进行野蛮轰炸，派出成千名美军、伪军和仆从军进行“扫荡”，烧毁房屋、破坏庄稼、掠夺粮食和极其野蛮地屠杀人民。对越南北方，他们正横蛮地恫吓要轰炸各个工业区和居民区，并且，为了给新的“逐步升级”作好准备，他们接连派出飞机进行极其明目张胆的侦察。显然，美国强盗非但不肯放弃侵略的阴谋，而且还正在加紧设法把侵越战争扩大到更加激烈的程度。
    社论号召越南人民继续进行长期为战斗服务的一切工作。其中，人民防空工作必须得到非常的重视。
    社论强调说，人民防空是人民战争的一个重要内容，是消灭敌人和保卫自己的任务中的一个方面。为了在新的一年中争取新的胜利，在各级党委的领导下，与促进全民打美国飞机运动的同时，从省到乡的各地军事机关，必须加强领导，及时地领导各基层积极、切实和周密地作好人民防空工作。
