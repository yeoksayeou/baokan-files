    According to a dispatch from Xinhua on the 28th, New York news: The New York State Supreme Court on the 27th brazenly sentenced William Epton, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Labor Party and black leader, to one year in prison.
    Before the sentencing, Epton made a statement in court for as long as forty minutes, powerfully exposing the U.S. government as "a criminal government." He said that this government has committed heinous crimes of mass slaughter against the Indians, Africans, and Vietnamese in the Americas. Epton also pointed out that the New York State judicial authorities are persecuting him because of his ideological views, and persecuting him is persecuting black people participating in anti-violent struggles.
    Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, January 27th—The Canadian "Progressive Workers Movement" severely condemns the U.S. government's persecution of William Epton, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Labor Party.
      The "Progressive Worker," a publication of the "Progressive Workers Movement," published a letter to readers signed by the organization's chairman, Jack Scott, and a protest letter to the Mayor of New York City in its February issue. The protest letter stated that "the conviction of Epton is the result of a despicable frame-up aimed at undermining the Progressive Labor Party and intimidating participants in the rapidly growing movement protesting American aggression."
    The protest letter pointed out that throwing Epton into prison will not stop the resistance of black people in the United States; this kind of terror action will not intimidate the American people either, nor will it stop them from participating in mass protest movements.
    Scott wrote in the letter to readers, "It would be wrong to think that the conviction of Epton is merely an attack on the Progressive Labor Party. The American imperialist aggressors, who are suffering serious military defeats abroad, are currently troubled by the rapidly growing protest movement at home; the strata to which this movement extends is becoming increasingly broad."
    The book concludes by saying, "The attack on Epton and the Progressive Labor Party undoubtedly marks the beginning of an intensified attack on the entire American people's protest movement, with the aim of stemming the momentum of this protest movement and ultimately suppressing it. Defending Epton and the Progressive Labor Party is inseparable from defending the entire movement." (Attached picture)

    据新华社二十八日讯  纽约消息：美国纽约州最高法院二十七日把美国进步劳工党副主席、黑人领袖威廉·埃普顿悍然判处一年徒刑。
    宣判前，埃普顿在法庭上发表了长达四十分钟的声明，有力地揭露了美国政府是“一个犯罪的政府”。他说，这个政府犯下了大规模屠杀美洲的印第安人、非洲人和越南人的滔天罪行。埃普顿还指出，纽约州司法当局是因为他的思想观点而对他进行迫害的，迫害他就是迫害参加抗暴斗争的黑人。
    新华社渥太华二十七日电　加拿大“进步工人运动”严厉谴责美国政府对美国进步劳工党副主席威廉·埃普顿的迫害。
      “进步工人运动”的刊物《进步工人》二月号发表了由这个组织的主席杰克·斯科特签署的致读者书和给纽约市长的一封抗议信。抗议信说，“给埃普顿定罪，是旨在破坏进步劳工党和恫吓正在迅速壮大的抗议美国侵略的运动的参加者的卑鄙陷害的结果。”
    抗议信指出，把埃普顿投入监狱并不能制止美国黑人的反抗；这种恐怖行动也吓不倒美国人民，阻止不了他们去参加群众性的抗议运动。
    斯科特在致读者书中写道，“认为给埃普顿的定罪只是对进步劳工党的进攻，那将是错误的。在国外遭到严重的军事挫败的美帝国主义侵略者，目前正被国内迅速壮大的抗议运动所困扰；这个运动所扩及的阶层正越来越广泛。”
    书中最后说，“对埃普顿和进步劳工党的进攻，无疑标志着对美国整个人民抗议运动加紧进攻的开始，其目的在于制止这一抗议运动的势头，并且最终把它压下去。保卫埃普顿和进步劳工党同保卫整个这个运动是分不开的。”（附图片）
