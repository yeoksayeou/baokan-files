Edition: 3

    Johnson's State of the Union address this year is a manifesto for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and a manifesto for intensifying the attack on the American people.
    Despite the many fine words Johnson used to try to deceive people, blatant war cries and frank demands on the American people to tighten their belts constitute the keynote of this year's State of the Union address.
    Johnson's State of the Union address begins with the Vietnam problem and ends with the Vietnam problem. Why has the Vietnam problem become the number one problem for the Johnson administration? Why is the State of the Union address filled with a heavy smell of gunpowder?
    The American imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has suffered a serious defeat. Nearly 200,000 American aggressor troops have entered South Vietnam, but still cannot reverse the defeat. "Gradual escalation" has been useless, and "peace talks" hoaxes have repeatedly gone bankrupt. The failure of American imperialism in South Vietnam has frustrated its counter-revolutionary "global strategy." Johnson helplessly admitted in his State of the Union address: "Because of Vietnam, we cannot do all that we should or would like to do."
    The result of intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam has further sharpened class contradictions within the United States, and promoted a new awakening of the American people. The rise of the black masses' struggle against violence and the vigorous development of the American people's anti-war movement have become two time bombs buried in the heart of American imperialism. Within the American ruling group, there is also endless infighting due to the failure of the war of aggression against Vietnam. This situation in the United States has deepened the anxiety and unease of the Johnson administration.
    As the *New York Times* put it, "As 1966 begins, the United States is falling into an unknown abyss." In American history, it is unprecedented for a war of aggression to suffer such a heavy blow and cause such a fierce shock.
    However, Johnson does not intend to climb out of this abyss. He attempts to find a way out by persisting in the war of aggression and expanding military adventures.
    All reactionaries in history inevitably make mistakes continuously until their demise. American imperialism, as the pillar of all contemporary reactionary forces, is certainly no exception. The successive failures on the South Vietnamese battlefield have not taught the Johnson administration the lessons it deserves.
    Johnson repeatedly clamored in his State of the Union address that American imperialism will "never retreat" in South Vietnam, and that "we must stay." What does this mean?
    This shows that American imperialism will never withdraw from South Vietnam voluntarily. The address explicitly declares that American troops will "stay until the aggression stops." In other words, unless the Vietnamese people completely stop their anti-American and national salvation struggle, and unless every inch of South Vietnamese territory is turned into a colony of American imperialism, the American aggressors will never leave the area.
    This shows that American imperialism will further expand the war of aggression. Johnson announced that the United States will increase its war expenses in Vietnam by $5.8 billion in the next year, and will ask Congress for "greater appropriations" as needed by the war. He also emphasized that no matter "how great the cost" or "how great the challenge," the United States will "fight on."
    This shows that American imperialism is trying to turn South Vietnam into a war base in Asia. Johnson undisguisedly said that the reason the United States wants to "stay" in South Vietnam is because the United States "does not intend to abandon Asia."
    People can only draw the following conclusion from the State of the Union address: Johnson is determined to open the American war machine at full power and continue along the road of expanding aggression. In Johnson's words, he "must" order America's "cannons to fire."
    In fact, American imperialism's recent activities to expand the war are far more than what Johnson said in his address. It is desperately scraping up cannon fodder, increasing the monthly draft quota at home to 80,000, which is equal to the highest draft quota during the Korean War. It is continuously increasing troops to South Vietnam, and is extensively expanding military bases there in order to send more aggressor troops to that area. It is implementing a dehumanizing "burn all, destroy all, kill all" "scorched earth" policy in the South Vietnamese liberated areas. It is carrying out larger-scale bombings of the Laotian liberated areas, and is instructing the Laotian rightists to intensify attacks on the patriotic armed forces. It is using Thai and South Vietnamese puppet troops to more frequently violate Cambodian territory. Facts have proven that although the American aggressors have been battered and bruised in South Vietnam, they still want to act recklessly to the end. Only when it is completely eliminated will it feel completely comfortable.
    In his war address, Johnson did not forget to insert some "peace" phrases. The more American imperialism expands its war of aggression against Vietnam, the more it must intensify its "peace offensive," which has become a rule.
    Johnson repeated platitudes from the "Fourteen Points" proposal in his address. He said that the United States "abides by" the Geneva Accords, respects the "principle of self-determination," and advocates Vietnam's "reunification." What is the value of these kinds of statements? Since he described South Vietnam as a "nation" in his State of the Union address, and stated unequivocally that American aggressors "must stay" in South Vietnam, then so-called "self-determination" and "unification" are nonsense, and the Geneva Accords are like waste paper.
    As for Johnson's mention of the 300 secret talks and contacts with the governments of more than 100 countries that the United States has conducted in the past year to "peacefully resolve" the Vietnam problem, this does not prove American imperialism's "sincerity." These activities are all aimed at deceiving public opinion, confusing right and wrong, and creating a smokescreen for its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The Johnson administration has sung many "peace" tunes over the past year, and military and political officials have run around, but it was during this period that the American aggressors' flames of war spread from South Vietnam to North Vietnam, and the scale of the war of aggression against Vietnam expanded to near the level of the Korean War.
    American imperialism is accustomed to using counter-revolutionary dual tactics. It always uses the "peace" hand to cover up and promote the war hand. "Peace" is a means, which it uses when it needs to, and throws away when it doesn't. It can pick it up again if it throws it away. Whether it is used or discarded, it is all for the purpose of achieving American imperialism's aggressive goals.
    The contradiction that American imperialism cannot overcome is: its war hand will inevitably expose the "peace" hand. Johnson's successive releases of "unconditional discussions," "Fourteen Points" proposals and other peace smokescreens are constantly being blown away by American planes and artillery. Now, he has stuffed some so-called "new stuff" into the "peace basket." One is "gradual de-escalation," that is, both sides "reduce the use of force"; the other is "fighting while talking," that is, fighting and meetings "proceed simultaneously." But who can be deceived by this? Currently, the Johnson administration is stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The so-called "gradual de-escalation" is actually just a guise to cover up "gradual escalation"; the so-called "fighting while talking," fighting is real, talking is fake. No matter what tricks Johnson plays, he cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world.
    The domestic part of Johnson's State of the Union address repeats the old tune of the "Great Society" and puts forward a comprehensive set of measures. Some of them are to paint a rosy picture, aimed at easing the American people's increasingly strong dissatisfaction with the American ruling group; while the substantive part is to intensify persecution and exploitation of the American people in order to adapt to the needs of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Johnson portrays the American economic situation as a thriving scene: the economy is "booming," people's lives are "affluent," and the next year's fiscal deficit "will be the lowest in many years," and so on. What is the truth of the matter? The abnormal development of the American economy in the past period has mainly relied on large-scale deficit financing, easing credit, implementing "tax cuts," and increasing military spending. This artificial stimulus has put the American economy in the face of a crisis of overproduction. Johnson's boast that next year's fiscal deficit "is only $1.8 billion" is even more of a complete lie. He deliberately does not include the tens of billions of dollars in additional war expenses in Vietnam that are being prepared. The war of aggression against Vietnam has greatly increased the burden on the American people. In the 1965 fiscal year, the average tax burden of each American was as high as $850, accounting for 32 percent of personal income, far higher than the levels during World War II and the Korean War. The reason why Johnson spares no effort to promote America's "prosperity" is to try to make the American people believe that cannons and butter can be had at the same time.
    American imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression abroad will inevitably lead to further attacks on the people at home. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "The American reactionaries, if they are to start a war, must first attack the American people. They are already attacking the American people; they are oppressing the American workers and democrats politically and economically, and preparing to practice fascism in the United States." The series of domestic measures put forward by Johnson in his address shows that the American ruling group wants to intensify its attack on the American people. He demanded that "police forces" be strengthened in order to suppress "dangerous strikes." He wants the working people to "exercise restraint" on wages and "make new sacrifices" when the war "requires" it. He decided to "improve" the tax system, forcing American taxpayers to take out more dollars and put them into the bottomless pit of the war of aggression against Vietnam. What Johnson put forward in his State of the Union address is only a very small part. Last year, the Johnson administration mobilized a large number of regular troops to bloodily suppress the anti-violence struggle of blacks in Watts, and deprived American workers of the right to strike by administrative means. This year, with the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, and with the increasing intensification of domestic class and national contradictions, the Johnson administration will inevitably adopt more brutal and more cruel fascist methods against the American people.
    It can be seen from Johnson's State of the Union address that the edge of American imperialism's sword is pointing at the Vietnamese people, at the revolutionary people of the world, and also at the American people. The "five policy lines" he put forward in his address is the specific plan formulated by American imperialism to promote the counter-revolutionary global strategy based on the current international situation. The Johnson administration is threatening and blackmailing the Vietnamese people, and slandering and attacking the Chinese people; it is throwing out economic bait to the Khrushchev revisionists. Johnson said: "The United States will seek to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union." There are many who are willing to take the bait. The Soviet TASS reported with great appreciation and complete affirmation that the American president will "ask Congress to make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union." Joy overflows.
    What does Johnson mean? He placed expanding trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in the fifth of the "five policy lines." This line is called "supporting national independence." He said unusually bluntly: "We pursue this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe." It is very clear that American imperialism openly announced that it would pursue a policy of peaceful penetration against socialist countries. This is a great insult to the Soviet people and the Eastern European people. The Khrushchev revisionists are even proud of this, which shows how far they have fallen.
    Johnson's State of the Union address is a challenge to the Vietnamese people, a challenge to the American people, and a challenge to all peace-loving countries and people. American imperialism made its fortune through war, and fattened itself through war. Now, it has been beaten bloody on the South Vietnamese battlefield, but it still wants to find a way out by expanding the war. It can be asserted that in the face of the brutal aggression and oppression of American imperialism, the Vietnamese people will resolutely give it an even heavier counterattack; the American people's anti-war movement, the struggle for democracy and the maintenance of living rights will inevitably have greater development; all forces in the world that oppose imperialism and love peace will also inevitably further unite, support the Vietnamese people who are fighting bloody battles, and completely defeat American imperialism's war plans and aggression plans. More serious failures await the American aggressors.

### 约翰逊的挑战——评美国总统的国情咨文

    约翰逊的挑战
    ——评美国总统的国情咨文
    约翰逊今年的国情咨文，是扩大侵越战争的咨文，是向美国人民加紧进攻的咨文。
    尽管约翰逊说了许多企图迷惑人心的漂亮话，但是，露骨的战争叫嚣，直言不讳地向美国人民提出勒紧裤带的要求，构成了今年国情咨文的基调。
    约翰逊的国情咨文，从越南问题谈起，又以越南问题煞尾。为什么越南问题成了约翰逊政府的头号问题呢？为什么国情咨文充满了浓重的火药味呢？
    美帝国主义对越南的侵略战争遭到严重的失败。将近二十万的美国侵略军进入南越，仍然无法挽回败局。“逐步升级”毫无作用，“和谈”骗局接连破产。美帝国主义在南越的失败，使它推行的反革命“全球战略”遭到了挫折。约翰逊在国情咨文中无可奈何地供认：“由于越南问题，我们所应该做的事或者愿意做的事我们不能全都做到。”
    对越南加紧进行侵略战争的结果，使得美国国内的阶级矛盾进一步尖锐化，促进了美国人民的新的觉醒。黑人群众抗暴斗争的兴起，美国人民反战运动的蓬勃发展，成为埋在美帝国主义心脏里的两颗定时炸弹。美国统治集团内部，也由于侵越战争的失败而争吵不休。美国国内的这种局势，更加深了约翰逊政府的焦虑和不安。
    正如《纽约时报》所说的，“在一九六六年开始的时候，美国正堕入未知的深渊之中”。在美国的历史上，一场侵略战争遭到如此沉重的打击，引起如此激烈的震动，是前所未有的。
    但是，约翰逊并不打算从这个深渊中爬出来。他妄图从坚持侵略战争和扩大军事冒险中寻找出路。
    历史上的一切反动派，都不可避免地要不断犯错误，直到它们的灭亡。作为当代一切反动势力的支柱的美帝国主义，当然更不会例外。南越战场上的接连失败，并没有使约翰逊政府接受应有的教训。
    约翰逊在国情咨文中一再叫嚷，美帝国主义在南越“决不退让”，“我们一定要留下来”。这意味着什么呢？
    这表明，美帝国主义决不会从南越自动撤军。咨文明确地宣告：美国军队将“留到侵略停止为止”。换句话说，不到越南人民完全停止抗美救国斗争，不把南越的每一寸土地都变为美帝国主义的殖民地，美国侵略者是决不会离开这个地区的。
    这表明，美帝国主义还要进一步扩大侵略战争。约翰逊宣布，美国下一年度的侵越战费，将增加五十八亿美元，并将根据战争的需要，向国会要求“更大的拨款”。他还强调，不管“费用多大”，“挑战多大”，美国都将“战斗下去”。
    这表明，美帝国主义力图把南越变为在亚洲的战争基地。约翰逊毫不掩饰地说，美国所以要在南越“留下来”，是因为美国“不打算放弃亚洲”。
    人们从国情咨文中只能得出这样的结论：约翰逊决心把美国战争机器开足马力，沿着扩大侵略的道路开去。用约翰逊的话来说，他“必须”命令美国的“大炮开火”。
    实际上，美帝国主义最近扩大战争的活动，比约翰逊在咨文中所说的要多得多。它竭力搜罗炮灰，把国内每月征兵额增加到八万人，等于侵朝战争时期征兵的最高额。它源源增兵南越，并在那里大肆扩建军事基地，以便把更多的侵略军派遣到那个地区去。它对南越解放区实行灭绝人性的“烧光、毁光、杀光”的“焦土”政策。它对老挝解放区进行更大规模的轰炸，并指使老挝右派对爱国军队加紧进攻。它利用泰国和南越傀儡军，更加频繁地侵犯柬埔寨的领土。事实证明，美国侵略者尽管已在南越碰得鼻青眼肿，但还要蛮干到底。它只有被彻底消灭，才会感到彻底舒服。
    约翰逊在他的战争咨文中，并没有忘记塞进一些“和平”词句。美帝国主义越是扩大侵越战争，它就越要加紧“和平攻势”，这已成为一条规律。
    约翰逊在咨文中重复“十四点”主张中的滥调。他说什么美国是“信守”日内瓦协议的，是尊重“自决原则”的，是主张越南“重新统一”的。这类表白，究竟能值几文钱呢？他在国情咨文中既然把南越说成是一个“国家”，并且斩钉截铁地声称美国侵略者在南越“一定要留下来”，那么，所谓“自决”、“统一”，都是废话，日内瓦协议也如同废纸。
    至于约翰逊所提到的美国在过去一年中为了“和平解决”越南问题，进行了三百次秘密会谈，同一百多个国家的政府接触，这也证明不了美帝国主义的“诚意”。这些活动，都是旨在欺骗舆论，混淆是非，为它扩大侵越战争制造烟幕。约翰逊政府一年来唱了不少“和平”曲调，军政要员四出奔走，但就是在这个时期内，美国侵略者的战火从越南南方燃烧到越南北方，侵越战争的规模扩大到接近侵朝战争的水平。
    美帝国主义惯用反革命两手策略。它总是以“和平”的一手，来掩盖和促进战争的一手。“和平”是一种手段，它用得着就用，用不着就抛开，抛开了可以拣起来再用。用也好，抛开也好，都是为了有利于达到美帝国主义的侵略目的。
    美帝国主义无法克服的矛盾是：它的战争的一手，必然要戳穿“和平”的一手。约翰逊接连放出的“无条件讨论”、“十四点”主张等和平烟幕，不断地被美国的飞机大炮所轰散。现在，他又在“和平篮子”里装进一点所谓“新货色”。一个是“逐步降级”，即双方“减少使用武力”；另一个是“边打边谈”，即战斗和会议“两者同时进行”。但是，这能骗得了谁呢？目前，约翰逊政府正在加紧扩大侵越战争。所谓“逐步降级”，实际上只是掩饰“逐步升级”的幌子；所谓“边打边谈”，打是真的，谈是假的。不管约翰逊玩弄什么样的手法，都遮蔽不了世人的耳目。
    约翰逊国情咨文的国内部分，重弹“伟大的社会”的老调，并提出了一大套包罗万象的措施。其中，有一些是属于粉饰太平的，目的在于缓和美国人民对美国统治集团日益强烈的不满；而实质的部分，则是为了适应扩大侵越战争的需要，对美国人民加紧迫害和压榨。
    约翰逊把美国经济情况描绘成一片欣欣向荣的景象：经济“正在蓬勃发展中”，人民生活“富足”，下一年度的财政赤字“将是多年来最低的”，等等。事情的真相是怎样的呢？过去一段时期内美国经济的畸形发展，主要是依靠大搞赤字财政、放宽信贷、实行“减税”、增加军费等办法来维持的。这种人为的刺激，已使美国经济面临生产过剩的危机。约翰逊吹嘘下一年度的财政赤字“只有十八亿美元”，更是个弥天大谎。他故意不把准备追加的几十亿侵越军费计算在内。侵越战争大大地加重了美国人民的负担。在一九六五财政年度，平均每个美国人的捐税负担，高达八百五十美元，占个人收入百分之三十二，远远高出于第二次世界大战和侵朝战争期间的水平。约翰逊所以不惜花费唇舌，大肆宣扬美国的“繁荣”，是妄图使美国人民相信：大炮和牛油可以兼得。
    美帝国主义对外扩大侵略战争，对内必然要进一步向人民开刀。毛泽东同志早就指出：“美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。他们已经在进攻美国人民了，他们从政治上、经济上压迫美国的工人和民主分子，准备在美国实行法西斯主义。”约翰逊在咨文中提出的一系列对内措施，正是表明美国统治集团要向美国人民加紧进攻。他要求加强“警察力量”，以便镇压“危险的罢工”。他要劳动人民对工资“采取克制态度”，并且在战争“需要”的时候“作出新的牺牲”。他决定“改进”税收制度，迫使美国的纳税人掏出更多的美元，投入侵越战争的无底洞。约翰逊在国情咨文中所提出的，只是微乎其微的一部分。去年，约翰逊政府调动了大批正规军血腥镇压瓦茨区黑人的抗暴斗争，以行政手段剥夺美国工人的罢工权利。今年，随着侵越战争的扩大，随着国内阶级矛盾和民族矛盾的日益加剧，约翰逊政府必然要对美国人民采取更加暴虐、更加凶残的法西斯手段。
    从约翰逊的国情咨文中可以看出，美帝国主义的刀锋，是向着越南人民的，是向着全世界革命人民的，也是向着美国人民的。他在咨文中提出对外的“五条政策路线”，就是美帝国主义根据当前国际形势而制定的推行反革命全球战略的具体方案。约翰逊政府对越南人民是威胁和讹诈，对中国人民是诬蔑和攻击；对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，则是抛出了经济钓饵。约翰逊说：“美国将设法扩大美国和东欧及苏联之间的贸易”。愿意上钩者大有人在。苏联塔斯社以十分赞赏和完全肯定的口气报道：美国总统将“请求国会使美国同东欧和苏联之间扩大贸易成为可能”。欢欣之情，溢于言表。
    约翰逊说的是什么意思呢？他把扩大同苏联和东欧国家的贸易，放在“五条政策路线”的第五条中。这一条，名曰“支持民族独立”。他异常露骨地说：“我们以建立通往东欧的桥梁来奉行这一原则。”十分明显，美帝国主义公开宣布要对社会主义国家推行和平渗透政策。这是对苏联人民和东欧人民的莫大侮辱。而赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对此竟然引以为荣，可见他们已经堕落到何等地步。
    约翰逊的国情咨文，是对越南人民的挑战，是对美国人民的挑战，是对一切爱好和平的国家和人民的挑战。美帝国主义是靠战争发家的，是靠战争养肥的。现在，它在南越战场上已被打得头破血流，却还想从扩大战争中寻找出路。可以断言，面对美帝国主义残暴的侵略和压迫，越南人民将坚决地给以更加沉重的回击；美国人民的反战运动、争取民主和维护生活权利的斗争，必将有更大的兴起；全世界一切反对帝国主义和爱好和平的力量，也必然进一步团结起来，支援浴血奋战中的越南人民，彻底挫败美帝国主义的战争计划和侵略计划。更严重的失败，等待着美国侵略者。
