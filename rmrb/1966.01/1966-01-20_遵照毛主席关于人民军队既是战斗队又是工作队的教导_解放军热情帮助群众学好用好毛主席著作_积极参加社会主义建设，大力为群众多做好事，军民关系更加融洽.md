    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, firmly bearing in mind Chairman Mao's teaching that the People's Army is both a fighting force and a working force, not only actively participate in socialist construction, but also, while modestly learning from the people, pay special attention to politically caring for the people, enthusiastically assisting them in the living study and application of Mao Zedong's works, and everyone strives to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought.
    The broad masses of commanders and fighters have realized from practice that highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, and using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds is the fundamental reason why our army's revolutionary and combat readiness construction continues to achieve new successes. They regard helping the masses study and apply Mao Zedong's works as their important political task. In the "one helps one, pair becomes red" activities carried out by many companies of the Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming troops with grassroots units or militia companies near their garrisons, they put studying and applying Mao Zedong's works together with the masses in the first place in mutual assistance and mutual learning. They help the local masses establish study groups, clubs, and tutoring stations, and regularly guide everyone in studying Mao Zedong's works. A training team from a certain infantry school of the Wuhan troops, responding to the call of the school party committee, helped nearby communes establish six "Mao Zedong's Works Study Tutoring Stations." The students often used holidays and festivals to go to the tutoring stations to work and study Mao Zedong's works together with the commune members. More than 300 students from a certain military medical college, after studying Chairman Mao's words that "The Red Army is by no means simply a fighting force; in addition to fighting to eliminate the enemy's military strength, it must also bear the important tasks of publicizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses establish revolutionary political power and even establish communist party organizations," used their spare time to conduct tutoring activities for more than 50 residential groups near their garrisons. Many companies stationed in the southwest and northwest border regions also helped fraternal ethnic groups establish night schools to study Mao Zedong's works.
      "A red line in marching, a red area in dwelling" is the slogan put forward by many troops during military field exercises or when going out to perform tasks. Wherever they went, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought. When marching, they carried buckets of lime and wrote quotations from Chairman Mao on the hillsides and roadsides along the way. Wherever they went, they used methods such as holding symposiums, showing slides, performing artistic programs, publishing blackboards, and holding photo exhibitions to publicize to the people the importance of studying Mao Zedong's works, and introduce the advanced experience of commanders and fighters in studying Mao Zedong's works. During a thousand-mile field exercise, a certain unit of the Beijing troops established a propaganda team for studying Mao Zedong's works. As soon as they arrived at the encampment, they helped the local militia and people study. When a certain unit of the Tibet Military Region's 18th detachment was on a field exercise, they held joint military-civilian soirees with the masses wherever they went, performing more than ten programs propagating Mao Zedong Thought, such as "Chairman Mao's Quotations Board," "I Love Reading Chairman Mao's Books Most," and "Mao Zedong Thought Shines with Golden Light." Many cadres and soldiers, during their home visits and in their correspondence with relatives and friends, enthusiastically helped their families, relatives, and friends creatively study and apply Mao Zedong's works.
    When cadres and soldiers of various units studied Mao Zedong's works together with the people, they paid special attention to using the experience of the troops in working hard on the word "application" to enlighten everyone to fight against non-proletarian ideas and establish a world view of "serving the revolution wholeheartedly and everything for the revolution." The production team where the machine gun company of a battalion of a certain unit of the Shenyang troops was stationed had some educated youths who were originally not very content with agricultural production. After studying Mao Zedong's works together with the commanders and fighters of the machine gun company, they said: To serve the people, one should be like Zhang Side and Bethune. Whatever the revolution needs, one should do. After they settled down to agricultural production, their enthusiasm for labor was greatly increased. They made extraordinary achievements in ordinary agricultural labor, and some were rated as activists in studying Mao Zedong's works in the province or special district. Some commune members in the garrison of a certain unit of the Nanjing troops originally believed that the natural conditions here were poor and lacked the confidence to change the backward situation. Under the unified leadership of the local party organization, the commanders and fighters helped each production team establish study groups of Mao Zedong's works, repeatedly studied articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and introduced the deeds of Dazhai people overcoming natural disasters and changing the world, which improved everyone's awareness and inspired the revolutionary spirit of overcoming difficulties. Through the efforts of the commune members, more than 90% of the production teams here increased production last year compared with the previous year, and some production teams have become advanced units.
    While studying Chairman Mao's books together with the people, the broad masses of commanders and fighters also modestly learned the advanced experiences and advanced deeds of the localities in creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, further promoting their own ideological revolutionization and work style revolutionization.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has a glorious tradition of supporting the government and cherishing the people, in the past year, following Chairman Mao's teachings on the People's Army cherishing the masses, actively participated in socialist construction, vigorously helped the people in disaster relief, cared for the masses everywhere, did good deeds for the masses, and made the relationship between the army and the people even closer.
    Last year, the vast rural areas of the country took Dazhai as an example, vigorously engaged in farmland capital construction, and changed the face of production. The various troops, while completing various tasks such as combat, training, and duty, extracted a large number of manpower and material resources and joined the people in this struggle to change the world. According to incomplete statistics from the leading organs of the Nanjing troops, last year, among the more than 580,000 working days they helped the local people engage in agricultural production, many were spent working together with the people to transform nature and carry out farmland capital construction.
    With the development of rural machinery, electrical, and water conservancy construction, the activities of various troops supporting the communes from a technical force are increasing. Engineering soldiers, armored soldiers, railway soldiers, and logistics departments, etc., trained and trained tens of thousands of tractor drivers, car drivers, engineering technicians, and electricians, welders, and other technical talents for the communes last year, and helped the communes repair more than 10,000 pieces of agricultural machinery and electrical equipment. Some of them sent people down to help the localities run short-term training classes; some organized rural youths to study with the soldiers, so that they quickly mastered repair technology. Last year, more than 100 technicians sent to the rural areas by the Lanzhou troops adopted the method of helping with work while bringing apprentices, which not only repaired machinery but also cultivated talents, and was very popular with the localities.
    In flood prevention and disaster relief, and in the struggle against various natural disasters, the commanders and fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought put the interests of the people first everywhere, bravely took the lead, and there have been many moving examples of fighting tsunamis, fighting floods, and putting out fires.
    In daily life, they also keep in mind Chairman Mao's teaching of "We must be concerned about the masses, help them solve their difficulties," think what the masses are thinking, are anxious about what the masses are anxious about, help what the masses need, and do everything possible to do good things for the masses.
    In the past year, while participating in socialist construction and caring for and cherishing the masses, the various troops have also received strong support and meticulous care from the masses. Wherever the troops are stationed and wherever the soldiers go, the military and civilians are as close as family members, protecting and building the motherland shoulder to shoulder.

    遵照毛主席关于人民军队既是战斗队又是工作队的教导
    解放军热情帮助群众学好用好毛主席著作
    积极参加社会主义建设，大力为群众多做好事，军民关系更加融洽
    据新华社十九日讯　中国人民解放军指战员牢记毛主席关于人民军队既是战斗队又是工作队的教导，不仅积极参加社会主义建设，而且在虚心向人民群众学习的同时，特别注意从政治上关怀人民群众，热情辅导他们活学活用毛主席著作，人人争当毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    广大指战员从实践中体会到，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，是我军革命化、战斗化建设不断取得新成就的根本原因。他们把帮助群众学好用好毛主席著作当作自己的重要政治任务。广州、福州、昆明等部队许多连队在和驻地附近的基层单位或民兵连队开展“一帮一、一对红”活动中，把和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作摆在互帮互学的第一位，他们帮助驻地群众建立学习小组、俱乐部和辅导站，定期辅导大家学习毛主席著作。武汉部队某步兵学校一个训练队，响应学校党委的号召，帮助附近公社建立了六个“毛主席著作学习辅导站”，学员们经常利用假日、节日，到辅导站和社员们共同劳动，共同学习毛主席著作。某军医学院三百多名学员，学习了毛主席说的“红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”这些话，利用业余时间对驻地附近五十多个居民组进行了辅导活动。驻守在西南、西北边疆的许多连队，还帮助兄弟民族建立了学习毛主席著作的夜校。
      “行军红一线，住下红一片”，这是不少部队在军事野营或外出执行任务时提出的口号。他们走到那里，就把毛泽东思想宣传到那里。行军时，他们手提石灰桶，沿途在山坡上、大路边写下毛主席语录。每到一处，就运用开座谈会、放幻灯、演文艺节目、出黑板报、举办图片展览等方法，向人民群众宣传学习毛主席著作的重要意义，介绍指战员学习毛主席著作的先进经验。北京部队某部在千里野营中，成立了学习毛主席著作宣传小组，一到宿营地，就帮助当地民兵和人民群众学习。西藏军区某部十八分队在野营时，每到一处就和群众举行军民联欢晚会，表演《毛主席的语录板》、《毛主席的书我最爱读》、《毛泽东思想闪金光》等十多个宣传毛泽东思想的节目。不少干部和战士在探家期间，在和亲友通讯往来时，都热情地帮助家属、亲友活学活用毛主席著作。
    各部队干部、战士在和人民群众一起学习毛主席著作时，特别注意运用部队在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验，启发大家向非无产阶级思想作斗争，树立“一心为革命、一切为革命”的世界观。沈阳部队某部一营机枪连驻地的生产队，有些知识青年原来不大安心农业生产，和机枪连指战员一起学习毛主席著作以后，他们说：为人民服务，就应该象张思德、白求恩那样，革命需要干什么，就干什么。他们安心农业生产以后，劳动积极性大大提高，在平凡的农业劳动中做出了不平凡的成绩，有的被评为省或专区学习毛主席著作的积极分子。南京部队某部驻地有的社员，原来认为这里自然条件差，缺乏改变后进面貌的信心。指战员们在地方党组织的统一领导下，帮助各生产队普遍建立了学习毛主席著作小组，反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章，介绍了大寨人战胜自然灾害改天换地的事迹，提高了大家的觉悟，激发了战胜困难的革命精神。经过社员们的努力，这里百分之九十以上的生产队，去年比前年都增了产，有些生产队还成了先进单位。
    广大指战员在同人民群众一起读毛主席的书的同时，还虚心学习了地方上活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验和先进事迹，进一步促进自己的思想革命化和作风革命化。
    据新华社十九日讯　有着拥政爱民光荣传统的中国人民解放军，过去一年里，遵循着毛主席关于人民军队爱护人民群众的教导，积极参加社会主义建设，大力帮助人民抢险救灾，处处关心群众，为群众做好事，使军民关系更加融洽无间。
    去年，全国广大农村以大寨为榜样，大搞农田基本建设，改变生产面貌。各部队在完成作战、训练、执勤等各项任务的前提下，抽出大批人力、物力和人民群众一道，投入了这一改天换地的斗争中。据南京部队领导机关不完全的统计，去年他们帮助当地人民从事农业生产的五十八万多个劳动日中，许多是同人民群众一道改造自然、进行农田基本建设的。
    随着农村机械、电气、水利建设的发展，各部队从技术力量上支援公社的活动越来越多。工程兵、装甲兵、铁道兵和后勤部门等，去年为公社培养和训练的拖拉机手、汽车驾驶员、工程技术人员和电工、焊工等技术人才数以万计，帮助公社修理的农业机械和电气设备在万件以上。他们有的派人下去，帮助地方举办短期训练班；有的组织农村青年同战士们一起学习，让他们很快掌握修理技术。兰州部队去年派往农村一百多名技术人员，采用了边帮助工作边带徒弟的方法，既修理了机械，又培养了人才，很受地方的欢迎。
    在防洪抢险，同各种自然灾害作斗争中，毛泽东思想武装起来的指战员们，更是处处以人民利益为重，奋勇当先，出现了战海啸、战洪水、扑灭大火等许多动人的事例。
    在日常生活中，也牢记着毛主席的“要关心群众，帮助他们解决困难”的教导，想群众所想，急群众所急，帮群众所需，千方百计为群众办好事。
    过去的一年，各部队在参加社会主义建设，关心和爱护群众的同时，也得到了人民群众的大力支援和无微不至的关怀照顾。部队驻地和战士们所到之处，军民亲如家人，并肩携手地保卫祖国、建设祖国。（附图片）
