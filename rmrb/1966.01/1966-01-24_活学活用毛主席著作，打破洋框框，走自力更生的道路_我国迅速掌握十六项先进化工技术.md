    Vigorously Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Writings, Break Foreign Conventions, and Take the Road of Self-Reliance
    Our Country Rapidly Masters Sixteen Advanced Chemical Technologies
    This is a fruitful result of emphasizing politics, following the mass line, and using the three-way combination method to concentrate forces to fight a war of annihilation, adapting to the urgent needs of our country's construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, relevant units in our country have achieved sixteen new scientific and technological achievements in chemical engineering at high speed. These sixteen new scientific and technological achievements, which are of great significance for increasing production and practicing economy and have reached advanced levels, have now been applied to chemical production for the most part.
    This batch of new scientific and technological achievements in chemical engineering was jointly researched and created by the broad masses of workers and staff, teachers and students of higher education institutions, scientific research personnel, and design personnel in our country's chemical industry departments, who vigorously studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings, eliminated superstition, eliminated metaphysics, and carried forward the spirit of combining soaring revolutionary drive with a high degree of realistic scientific attitude, using the fastest speed.
    Recently, the State Economic Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly convened a conference in Beijing, inviting dozens of representatives from relevant units who have contributed to these major scientific and technological achievements to introduce to the participants the experience of how they climbed the peaks of science and technology. Relevant personnel from various departments of the central industrial and transportation system also participated in this conference.
    During the conference, Vice Premier Bo Yibo gave an important report to the conference, commending all the units and personnel who had achieved the sixteen new scientific and technological achievements in chemical engineering, believing that they were the first batch of outstanding units and personnel who emphasized politics, followed the mass line, and used the method of concentrating forces to fight a war of annihilation to make brilliant achievements in science and technology. It was believed that they were also units and personnel who created good typical examples for how production units, scientific research units, and institutions of higher learning in our country could conduct three-way combinations. He called on all relevant units and scientific and technological workers to learn from these units and personnel. Vice Premier Bo also met with all the representatives attending the conference together with the responsible comrades of the relevant departments.
    The sixteen newly researched and successfully developed major scientific and technological achievements belong to new technologies, new processes, and new equipment in aspects of chemical fertilizers, advanced chemicals, synthetic rubber, plastics, organic chemical raw materials, and medicine, and they are all urgently needed projects for our country's current economic construction and national defense construction.
    After production verification, these new scientific and technological achievements have extremely significant implications for promoting the development of our country's industrial production and national defense construction.
    At this conference, the experience of the workers of a chemical plant in Sichuan Province working together with the teachers and students of relevant teaching and research sections of Tsinghua University to carry out revolutionary transformation of the key equipment of nitrogen fertilizer plants—ammonia synthesis towers—was specially introduced. With only a small amount of investment, they doubled the production capacity. After the transformation, the daily output of this backward equipment of the 1940s was even higher than that of the world's advanced equipment of the 1960s. Currently, one-quarter of the ammonia synthesis towers in large nitrogen fertilizer plants across the country have undergone the same transformation.
    In the past, our country's production technology of chloroprene rubber was relatively backward. However, the workers and scientific and technological workers of relevant units in our country relied on Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, and, after unremitting research and experimentation, only took less than a year to revolutionize the backward process flow, greatly turning over our country's chloroprene rubber production, increasing production capacity several times. At the same time, some other relevant units in our country also mastered the new technology for manufacturing another new type of synthetic rubber—cis-butadiene rubber—making our country's synthetic rubber increase an important variety.
    In the past, chemical products such as new types of synthetic ammonia catalysts that our country could not manufacture and that only a very few countries in the world could produce are now also being manufactured. High-efficiency distillation columns and other chemical equipment created by our country's scientific and technological workers have also been successfully trial-produced. These products and equipment have extremely significant effects in improving labor productivity, reducing energy consumption, saving manufacturing costs, and reducing production costs.
    All of these scientific and technological achievements have been researched and experimented successfully at high speed. Some have already been used in production. The entire process from small-scale experiments to putting these scientific and technological achievements into production generally only took one or a few years. In foreign countries, it took some more than ten years to complete the same project, and some even took decades.
    Why is it that our country's chemical technology level is relatively low, but we can surpass the development speed of science and technology in capitalist countries, and in some aspects even reach the most advanced level?
    The personnel participating in the chemical science and technology experiments unanimously believe that the most fundamental reason is that they have mastered and applied Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful weapon. They said that they relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to transform both themselves and the objective world. They are convinced that in scientific experiments, constantly summing up experience and constantly exploring the truth, spirit can be completely transformed into matter, and matter can also be transformed into spirit. They said that they dared to advance in the face of difficulties, persevere, and courageously climb the peaks of science and technology only after overcoming the multiple obstacles of individualism, conservatism, superstition in foreign conventions, and subjective idealism.
    Some scientific and technological personnel said that in the past, they would look for Chairman Mao's writings when ideological and political problems could not be solved; they would only consult foreign literature when there were technical problems. However, after hitting the wall so many times and taking so many detours in the latter practice, they realized that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the best weapon for transforming society and transforming people's thinking, but also the best guide for unlocking the secrets of science and technology.
    The scientific and technological personnel participating in the research and experimentation of these projects used their own personal practice to prove that once scientific research work is combined with production practice and with the masses of workers participating in actual operation, it can generate endless power. They said that the reason why these projects can be quickly successful is that scientific research personnel and teaching personnel followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into practice, went deep into the masses, and implemented the three-way combination with chemical plant workers. In the three-way combination, they absorbed the wisdom and creativity of the masses, took many fewer detours, thereby ensuring the fast, good, and economical completion of scientific and technological research projects.

    活学活用毛主席著作，打破洋框框，走自力更生的道路
    我国迅速掌握十六项先进化工技术
    这是突出政治，走群众路线，用三结合方法，集中力量打歼灭战的硕果，适应我国建设的迫切需要。
    新华社二十三日讯  我国有关单位在毛泽东思想指引下用高速度夺得了十六项化工科学技术新成果。这十六项对增产节约具有重大意义，并且达到了先进水平的科学技术新成果，现在大部分已经应用到了化工生产上。
    这批化工科学技术新成果，是我国化工部门广大职工和高等院校师生、科学研究人员、设计人员活学活用毛主席著作，破除迷信、破除形而上学，发扬了冲天的革命干劲和高度的实事求是科学态度相结合的精神，用最快的速度共同研究创造出来的。
    最近，国家经委、国家科委、化学工业部、高等教育部和中国科学院，在北京联合召开了会议，邀请对这些重大科学技术成果作出贡献的有关单位的数十名代表，向出席大会的人员介绍他们如何攀登科学技术高峰的经验。中央工业交通系统的各部门有关人员也参加了这次会议。
    在会议期间，薄一波副总理向大会作了重要报告，表扬了夺取十六项化工科学技术新成果的所有单位、人员，认为他们是突出政治，走群众路线，用集中力量打歼灭战的方法，在科学技术上做出辉煌成就的第一批优秀单位、人员。认为他们也是为我国生产单位、科学研究单位和高等院校如何进行三结合创造了很好的典型的单位、人员。他号召各有关单位和科学技术工作者向这些单位、人员学习。薄副总理还同有关部门的负责同志一道接见了参加会议的全体代表。
    新研究成功的十六项重大科学技术成果，属于化肥、高级化工、合成橡胶、塑料、有机化工原料和医药等方面的新技术、新工艺和新设备，它们都是当前我国经济建设和国防建设的迫切需要项目。
    经过生产考验证明，这些科学技术新成果，对促进我国工业生产和国防建设的发展，都有着极为重大的意义。
    在这次会议上，特别介绍了四川一个化工厂的职工们同清华大学有关教研室的师生们一道，对氮肥厂关键设备——氨合成塔进行革命性改造的经验。他们只用了很少的投资，就把生产能力提高了一倍。这种四十年代水平的落后设备经过改造之后，日产量比世界六十年代的先进设备还要高。目前，全国大型氮肥厂已经有四分之一的氨合成塔，都进行了同样的改造。
    过去我国氯丁橡胶的生产技术比较落后。但是，我国有关单位的工人和科学技术工作者靠毛泽东思想，发扬了自力更生的革命精神，经过坚韧不拔的研究试验，只用了不到一年的时间就革掉了落后工艺流程的命，使我国的氯丁橡胶生产大大地翻了身，生产能力提高了好几倍。在此同时，我国另外一些有关单位，还掌握了制造另一种新型合成橡胶——顺丁橡胶的新技术，使我国合成橡胶增加了一个重要的品种。
    过去我国不会制造的、在世界上也只有极少数国家才能生产的合成氨新型催化剂等化工产品，现在也制造出来了。我国科学技术工作者自己创造的高效率蒸馏塔等多种化工设备，也都试制出来了。这些产品和设备，在提高劳动生产率、减少能量消耗、节省制造费用和降低生产成本等方面，都有极为显著的作用。
    所有这些科学技术成果，都是高速度地研究和试验成功的。有的已经用于生产。这些科学技术成果从小试验到投入生产的全部过程，一般只用了一年或几年的时间。而在国外，完成同样的项目有的用了十几年，有的甚至用了几十年。
    为什么我国化工技术水平比较低，反而能超越资本主义国家科学技术的发展速度，而且在某些方面还达到了最先进的水平呢？
    参加化工科学技术实验的人员一致认为，最根本的原因是他们掌握和运用了毛泽东思想这一强大武器。他们说，他们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，既改造了自己，也改造了客观世界。他们确信，在科学实验中不断总结经验，不断探索真理，精神完全可以变成物质，物质也可以变成精神。他们说，他们是在战胜了个人主义、因循保守、迷信洋框框和主观唯心主义的重重障碍之后，才敢于知难而进，百折不挠，勇于向科学技术险峰攀登的。
    有些科学技术人员说，他们过去是在思想政治问题解决不了的时候找毛主席著作；技术有问题的时候只去请教外国文献。可是在后者实践中碰了多少次的钉子，走了多少次的弯路之后，才觉悟到：毛泽东思想不仅是改造社会、改造人的思想的最好武器，也是揭开科学技术秘密的最好的指南。
    参加研究试验这些项目的科学技术人员用自己的切身实践证明，科学研究工作一旦同生产实践相结合，同参加实际操作的工人群众相结合，就能产生无穷无尽的力量。他们说，这些项目之所以能迅速获得成功，是由于科学研究人员和教学人员遵循着毛主席的教导，深入实际，深入群众，同化工厂职工实行了三结合。在三结合当中，他们吸取了群众的智慧和创造，少走了许多弯路，从而保证了科学技术研究项目多快好省地完成。
