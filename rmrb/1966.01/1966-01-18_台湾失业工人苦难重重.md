    Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: Due to the penetration of American monopoly capital and the heavy exploitation by the Chiang gang, a wave of business failures has recently swept across Taiwan, leading to mass unemployment among workers, who are living in dire conditions of hunger and cold.
    Forced to Live in Dilapidated Air-raid Shelters
    On New Year's Eve of 1965, an unemployed worker in Taipei, impoverished and sick, had nowhere to live. Supporting his ailing wife, he struggled to "live" in a dilapidated air-raid shelter near Yanping Park on the Tamsui River, where they groaned in pain all night.
    The unemployed worker, named Chen Qinglian, was originally a truck driver. He was laid off in July of last year due to high blood pressure. After losing his job, he first pawned his possessions and then borrowed money from all sides. Three months ago, Chen Qinglian and his wife were forced to take their only straw mat and a tattered quilt and roam the streets as beggars because they could no longer afford the rent. In the bitter cold of the year's end, driven by hunger and cold, the couple had no choice but to "live" in this dark and damp dilapidated air-raid shelter.
    Electrician's Daughter Sells Herself to Pay for Mother's Medical Treatment
    According to a report in the *Taiwan Daily* on December 26th of last year, in Lukang Township, Changhua County, Taiwan, an electrician named Ye cannot find stable work, making it impossible to support his family. His wife fell ill due to overwork but there was no money for treatment. His daughter is willing to publicly "sell herself to pay for her mother's medical treatment."
    This middle-aged worker, although skilled in installing and repairing electrical equipment, cannot find work in Taiwan. For the past three or four years, he has been unemployed at home, at his wit's end. His two children, both under twenty, often sob quietly as they watch their unemployed father and sick mother. Recently, his daughter, in desperation, asked her mother to allow her to "sell herself to pay for her mother's medical treatment." The mother and daughter cried in each other's arms for days and nights, and decided to sell her to someone "regardless of provincial origin" for 20,000 Taiwan dollars, using the money to pay for her mother's medical expenses.
    Unemployed Carpenter in Desperate Straits
    On December 25th of last year, while American military and political personnel stationed in Taiwan and some heads of the Chiang gang were indulging in extravagant revelry on Christmas Eve, on the streets of Taipei, an unemployed carpenter's mother, an 82-year-old widow, braved the biting cold, leaning on a cane, begging along the streets, hoping that passers-by would give alms to pay for her son's medical treatment.
    This old woman lives in a small, dilapidated attic in Taipei. Her son, named Chen Liantong, is a carpenter. He recently contracted a lung disease and has been unemployed ever since. His home is bare, and the mother and son rely on neighbors for scraps of leftover food to stave off hunger, and beg for two pieces of tattered clothing to cover themselves. They have no money for medical treatment. Recently, Chen Liantong's condition has worsened. His mother, dragging her old and weak body, went out into the streets at night to beg from passers-by.
    Taiwanese newspapers report that just as this carpenter had reached the end of his rope, the Chiang gang's electricity company cut off his electricity because he could not pay the electricity bill.

    台湾失业工人苦难重重
    新华社十七日讯　由于美国垄断资本的渗透和蒋帮的重重剥削，近来台湾工商企业倒风四起，大批工人失业，他们过着饥寒交迫的悲惨生活。
    只好住进破防空洞
    一九六五年除夕，台北市一个失业工人，贫病交迫，无处栖身，他扶着患病的妻子，步履艰难地连走带爬“住”进了淡水河边延平公园附近的一个破防空洞里，整夜在那里痛苦呻吟。
    这个失业工人名叫陈清莲，原来是汽车司机。去年七月间他因患高血压而被解雇。失业以后，先是靠典当度日，然后四处借贷。三个月以前，陈清莲夫妇因为交不起房租，被迫携带着仅有的一张草席和一床破棉絮，流落街头，乞讨为生。在岁暮残冬，饥寒交迫的情况下，这对夫妇走投无路，只好“住”进这个阴暗潮湿的破防空洞里。
    电工女儿卖身医母
    据《台湾日报》去年十二月二十六日报道，在台湾彰化县鹿港镇有一个姓叶的电气工人，因为找不到固定工作，一家人的生活无法维持，他的妻子操劳成疾，也无钱医治，他的女儿为此要公开“卖身医母”。
    这个中年工人，虽然有安装、修理电气设备的技术，但是在台湾却找不到工作。三、四年来，赋闲在家，一筹莫展。他的两个二十岁以下的儿女，看着失业的父亲和有病的母亲，常常吞声饮泣。最近，他的女儿在无可奈何的情况下，请求她的母亲允许她“卖身医母”，母女两人抱头痛哭了几天几夜，决定以两万元台币的身价卖给“不论省籍”的人，将所得的钱作为她母亲的医药费。
    失业木工陷于绝境
    去年十二月二十五日，正当侵台美国军政人员和蒋帮的一些头目花天酒地欢度圣诞节之夜的时候，在台北街头，有一个失业木工的母亲、八十二岁的老寡妇，冒着刺骨的寒风，扶着拐杖，沿街乞讨，希望行路的人们施舍，好为她的儿子治病。
    这个老妇人住在台北市的一间小破阁楼上。她的儿子名叫陈连桐，是个木工，不久前得了肺病，从此失业。他家徒四壁，母子两人每日靠邻居们给一点剩饭残汤充饥，向人家讨两件破衣片遮身，哪里有钱治病。最近，陈连桐病情加重，他的母亲拖着年老衰弱的身躯，黑夜走到街头向行人求乞。
    台湾报纸说，就在这个木工到了山穷水尽的地步时，由于付不出电灯费，蒋帮电力公司便将他家的电线剪断。
