    Accepting Comrade Wu Han's Challenge
    Si Tong
    The current great debate in the ideological sphere sparked by "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is just beginning. After reading Comrade Wu Han's "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," I feel even more that this debate needs to continue. Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism, whether academically or politically, has not addressed the essence of the problem or touched on the crux. In over ten thousand words, he only deviously and stubbornly defends his erroneous views. I am prepared to offer some opinions here, focusing on Comrade Wu Han's motives.
    Comrade Wu Han first raised the question in his article: "Why did I study Hai Rui?" This question is what people want to know, and it is also necessary for Comrade Wu Han to seriously examine it. But how did Comrade Wu Han answer this question?
    Comrade Wu Han first stated: "My research on Hai Rui took place in the two years of 1959 and 1960." Then he listed his articles about Hai Rui and their writing dates, reiterating that these articles, "except for the preface to 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' were all written before 1960."
    Truly, "a guilty conscience needs no accuser!" Why did Comrade Wu Han emphasize the writing time so much? Obviously, it was in response to Comrade Yao Wenyuan's criticism, attempting to show that his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" had no connection with the "going it alone" wind and the "reversal of verdicts" wind of 1961. In his "self-criticism" article, he repeatedly defended himself on this issue.
    Comrade Wu Han's article is a "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," but after listing the articles, he first talked about his article "On Hai Rui," emphasizing that this article was written according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in Lushan in August 1959. After quoting a passage from the end of this article, he said: "This article was against right-leaning opportunism at that time, against those who falsely impersonated and distorted Hai Rui." Look, according to Comrade Wu Han, his article not only had no connection with the "going it alone" wind and the "reversal of verdicts" wind, but also opposed right-leaning opportunism!
    Since Comrade Wu Han has brought up the Lushan Conference and raised the banner of opposing right-leaning opportunism, then we have no choice but to accept his challenge, analyze the situation in 1959, study the spirit of the Lushan Conference, and then see what Comrade Wu Han did before and after this conference.
    Everyone remembers that in the first half of 1959, before the Lushan Conference, the situation was: under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our Party and the people of the whole country had achieved great successes, but also encountered temporary economic difficulties, and there were some shortcomings and errors in our work. Domestic and foreign enemies thought there was an opportunity to be exploited, and vainly attempted to carry out a restoration. The right-leaning opportunists within the Party, in coordination with domestic and foreign enemies, had already begun to肆意attack the Party and socialism, while others were sharpening their swords, ready to make trouble. In this situation, what did Comrade Wu Han do? Thanks to him for listing these articles in a timeline, making it clear at a glance. Two months before the Lushan Conference (June 16, 1959), Comrade Wu Han published his first article about Hai Rui, namely "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." Comrade Wu Han's article did not contain a single word of specific class analysis of Hai Rui's "scolding" of the emperor, but only tried his best to exaggerate how happy and brave the "scolding" was, saying: "In feudal times, the emperor was inviolable, and even the emperor's name had to be avoided,... as for scolding the emperor, that was unheard of... The one who really scolded the emperor, and scolded him very happily, was Hai Rui." He enthusiastically praised this kind of "scolding" as having the support of the people. Who exactly was he encouraging, and cheering for? What kind of emotions was he inciting, and what kind of wind was he blowing?
    It was also in this article that Comrade Wu Han praised a Peking Opera that scolded the emperor, writing: "The people wanted to scold the emperor but could not, so scolding in the play to feel happy is also good." These words can very well serve as a footnote to his later bringing this kind of "scolding" to the stage, and to his writing the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    The Lushan Conference crushed the rampant attack of the right-leaning opportunists, and exposed their true face of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism. The Lushan Conference called for further eliminating the ideological influence of right-leaning opportunism, adhering to the Party's general line for socialism, adhering to the banner of the Great Leap Forward, and adhering to the banner of the People's Commune.
    Comrade Wu Han published the article "On Hai Rui" not long after the Lushan Conference. The main purpose of this article was to praise Hai Rui and call on people to learn from Hai Rui. The paragraph at the end of the article about opposing right-leaning opportunists falsely impersonating Hai Rui was completely an addition, and not Comrade Wu Han's original intention. Therefore, Comrade Wu Han cannot use this to prove that he had politically stood firm on the class stand.
    Comrade Wu Han's political stance is prominently manifested in his play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." As everyone knows, after the right-leaning opportunists failed in their attack on the Party, they received the punishment they deserved, and some people were removed from their positions, that is, "dismissed" from "office." It was precisely at this time, not long after the Lushan Conference, that Comrade Wu Han began to write "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Was writing this play intended to oppose right-leaning opportunists falsely impersonating Hai Rui? Not at all. The right-leaning opportunists were dismissed from office, and Comrade Wu Han wrote about how Hai Rui was dismissed from office. Is this a coincidence?
    In the "Preface" to this play, Comrade Wu Han said: "This play focuses on Hai Rui's uprightness, not yielding to violence, not being intimidated by failure, and having the strong will to try again after failure... In this struggle, Hai Rui lost his official position, but he did not surrender or lose heart. At that time, the people supported him and praised him because he had done good deeds. Hai Rui's historical status should be affirmed, and some of his good qualities are worth learning from today." Indeed, this play showed great sympathy and endless regret for a "good official" who was "upright and unyielding" and ended up being dismissed from office. After watching this play, Comrade Fan Xing said that this kind of "good play" made people "emotional," "angry," "shed tears," "beat their chairs and stamp their feet, sighing and groaning," and "their brains were spinning." This is precisely the effect that Comrade Wu Han wanted to achieve. As for what these people were thinking about after watching it, Fan Xing said "no need to elaborate," anyway, it was tacitly understood in the article.
    Comrade Wu Han tried his best to avoid this essential issue, saying that when he wrote this play, he "did not think of the principle of 'making the past serve the present' at all." Is this believable? According to Comrade Wu Han's own words, he wrote articles about Hai Rui in order to have people today learn from Hai Rui, and even to "oppose right-leaning opportunism," so how could he have "forgotten class struggle" when it came to writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," becoming "purely for the sake of the past" and not "thinking of 'making the past serve the present' at all"? Comrade Wu Han quoted a passage from Chairman Mao about motives and effects in his self-criticism. The meaning of Chairman Mao's passage is that "social practice and its effects are the criteria for testing subjective desires or motives." However, Comrade Wu Han did not follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's passage, and did not check his motives based on the effects, but only checked the effects based on the effects.
    Is Comrade Wu Han really writing for the sake of the past? No. Comrade Wu Han has always emphasized that studying history and writing historical dramas should make the past serve the present, as evidenced by his series of articles on historical dramas. Even in an open letter to Fan Xing ("Some Questions about Historical Dramas"), when he talked about his experience in writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he also said: "Whether it is a history book or a historical drama, the characters in it are by no means the resurrection of zombies. Writing about this person and playing this person must focus on the enlightening role of a certain aspect of him or her for later generations... In a word, it is not for the dead, but to serve the living... to make the past serve the present." Isn't this clear enough? But Comrade Wu Han is deliberately avoiding this point today, saying that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is "completely for the sake of the past, for the sake of writing a play." Doesn't this precisely prove from the opposite side that Comrade Wu Han wrote this play with ulterior motives?
    The crux lies here. We say that Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism has not touched on the crux, and politically speaking, it has not touched on the crux of the motive for writing this play, nor has it touched on the crux of "dismissal from office." Just taking the writing of "dismissal from office" to allude to reality, its seriousness exceeds that of "Xie Yaohuan" and "Li Huiniang." This is not "writing for the sake of the past," but "using the past to satirize the present"; not "writing a play for the sake of writing a play," but writing a play for the sake of politics; not "forgetting class struggle," but representing the bourgeoisie and the feudal class to fight against the proletariat. It seems that Comrade Wu Han wanted to vent his dissatisfaction with the Party and socialism in a happy way, and even thought that "scolding in the play to feel happy is also good." "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is precisely the realization of this idea. Comrade Wu Han said in the preface to this play: "The history of the development of human society is also the history of people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do."
    "It seems that I also belong to the category of daring in writing scripts." Hai Rui not only dared to speak, but also dared to scold. Comrade Wu Han "studied" and "inherited" Hai Rui's "good qualities" and wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Although the scolding was more implicit and tortuous, he was still "in the category of daring," only slightly lacking in admitting his true motives.
    In his self-criticism, Comrade Wu Han wanted to avoid political issues and attribute all his mistakes to academic issues. Of course, academic issues need to be further discussed, because when Comrade Wu Han talked about academic issues such as Hai Rui, honest officials, moral inheritance, and the evaluation of historical figures in his self-criticism, he actually thought that he was correct, or at least basically correct. I hope everyone will fully discuss these issues. However, political issues cannot be avoided. I am not saying that all of Comrade Wu Han's articles about Hai Rui have political errors, but "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" does have both academic and political issues. Comrade Wu Han's journey from praising Hai Rui as a person to sympathizing with Hai Rui's "dismissal from office" is not accidental.
    I am analyzing this issue from social practice and its effects. As for what Comrade Wu Han was thinking in his heart, I would like to ask him to conduct a deep self-examination.

    接受吴晗同志的挑战
    思彤
    《海瑞罢官》所引起的当前意识形态领域的一场大辩论，现在还是刚刚开始。看了吴晗同志《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》，更加感到这场辩论还需要继续开展。吴晗同志的检讨，无论是在学术方面还是政治方面，都没有谈到问题的本质，没有触及要害。洋洋万余言，只是迂回曲折地同时也是顽固地维护自己的错误观点。我准备在这里着重从吴晗同志的动机方面提一点意见。
    吴晗同志在文章中首先提出了“我为什么研究海瑞”的问题。这个问题是人们想要知道的，也是需要吴晗同志认真检查的。可是吴晗同志是怎样答复这个问题的呢？
    吴晗同志首先声明：“我研究海瑞，是在一九五九年、一九六○年两年中的事。”然后他把自己关于海瑞的文章和写作时间排了一个队，再次指出这些文章“除了《海瑞罢官》的序文以外，都是一九六○年以前写的。”
    真是“此地无银三百两”！吴晗同志为什么要如此强调写作时间呢？显然是针对姚文元同志的批评而发的，企图用此表明他的《海瑞罢官》和一九六一年的“单干风”“翻案风”没有联系。他在“自我批评”一文中，反复地就这个问题加以辩解。
    吴晗同志的文章是《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》，可是在文章排队后，首先谈到的却是他的《论海瑞》那篇文章，强调指出这篇文章是根据一九五九年八月间在庐山举行的中国共产党八届八中全会的精神写的。他引用了这篇文章末尾的一段话以后说：“这篇文章在那个时候是反对右倾机会主义的，反对假冒、歪曲海瑞的。”请看，按照吴晗同志的说法，他的文章不仅和“单干风”、“翻案风”没有联系，而且是反右倾机会主义的哩！
    既然吴晗同志提出了庐山会议，打起了反右倾机会主义的旗帜，那么，我们也就只好接受他的挑战，分析一下一九五九年的形势，研究一下庐山会议的精神，再看看吴晗同志在这个会议前后做了些什么。
    大家记得，一九五九年上半年，在庐山会议之前，当时的形势是：在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，我们党和全国人民取得了伟大的成绩，但是也遇到暂时的经济困难，在工作中也有一些缺点错误。国内外敌人以为有可乘之机，妄想进行复辟。党内的右倾机会主义分子配合着国内外的敌人，有的已经开始对党和社会主义肆意攻击，有的正在摩拳擦掌，蠢蠢欲动。在这种形势下，吴晗同志却作了些什么呢？感谢他把这些文章排了一个时间表，使人一目了然。在庐山会议前两个月（一九五九年六月十六日），吴晗同志发表了关于海瑞的第一篇文章，即《海瑞骂皇帝》。吴晗同志的这篇文章，没有一个字对海瑞的“骂”皇帝作一点具体的阶级分析，只是极力渲染“骂”得如何痛快和勇敢，说：“在封建时代，皇帝是不可侵犯的，连皇帝的名字都要避讳，……至于骂皇帝，那是没有听说过的。……真正骂过皇帝，而又骂得非常之痛快的是海瑞。”他热情歌颂这种“骂”法是得到人民支持的。这究竟是在给谁打气，为谁喝采呢？是在煽动一种什么样的情绪，吹一股什么样的风呢？
    也正是在这篇文章里，吴晗同志赞扬了一个骂皇帝的京剧，写道：“人民想骂皇帝而不可得，在戏上骂骂，痛快一下，也是好的。”这些话，很可以为他以后把这种“骂”搬上舞台，为他写《海瑞罢官》这出戏作注脚。
    庐山会议粉碎了右倾机会主义者的猖狂进攻，揭穿了他们反对党，反对人民，反对社会主义的真面目。庐山会议号召进一步肃清右倾机会主义的思想影响，坚持党的社会主义总路线，坚持大跃进的旗帜，坚持人民公社的旗帜。
    吴晗同志在庐山会议后不久，发表了《论海瑞》一文。这篇文章的主旨是歌颂海瑞，号召向海瑞学习。文章末尾关于反对右倾机会主义者假冒海瑞的一段话，完全是外加的，不是吴晗同志的本意。因此，吴晗同志不能借此来说明自己在政治上站稳了阶级立场。
    吴晗同志的政治立场，突出地表现在他的《海瑞罢官》这个剧本中。大家知道，右倾机会主义者向党进攻失败以后，受到了应得的处分，有些人被撤了职，也就是“罢”了“官”。正是在这个时候，在庐山会议以后不久，吴晗同志开始动笔写《海瑞罢官》了。写这出戏是为了反对右倾机会主义分子假冒海瑞吗？根本不是。右倾机会主义者被罢了官，吴晗同志就写海瑞如何被罢了官。这难道是偶合吗？
    吴晗同志在这出戏的《前言》中说：“这个戏着重写海瑞的刚直不阿，不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志。……在这场斗争中，海瑞丢了官，但他并不屈服，不丧气。当时人民因为他做了好事，拥护他，歌颂他。海瑞的历史地位是应当肯定的，他的一些好的品德，也是值得我们今天学习的。”的确，这出戏对一个“刚直不阿”而落得一个罢官下场的“好官”，寄予了极大的同情，表示了无限的惋惜。繁星同志看了这出戏以后说，这种“好戏”看了以后叫人“动感情”，“动肝火”，“掉眼泪”，“捶椅顿脚，唉声叹气”，“脑子转个不停”。这正是吴晗同志想达到的效果。至于这些人看了以后脑子里转些什么，繁星说“不用细说”，反正在文章里是心照不宣的。
    吴晗同志千方百计地要避开这个实质问题，说什么写这出戏的时候，对“古为今用”的原则“一点也没有想起过”。这能叫人相信吗？按照吴晗同志自己的说法，他写海瑞的文章是为了要今人向海瑞学习，甚至是为了“反对右倾机会主义”，怎么一到了写《海瑞罢官》，就“为古而古”，对“古为今用”就“一点也没有想起过”呢？吴晗同志在自我批评中引了毛主席关于动机和效果的一段话。主席这段话的意思是说，“社会实践及其效果是检验主观愿望或动机的标准。”但是，吴晗同志没有按照毛主席这段话的精神，根据效果来检查动机，而仅仅就效果检查效果。
    吴晗同志真的为古而古吗？不。吴晗同志一直是强调研究历史和写历史剧要古为今用的，有他的一系列关于历史剧的文章为证，就在给繁星的一封公开信（《关于历史剧的一些问题》）中，他谈写《海瑞罢官》的体会时还说：“无论是历史书也吧，历史剧也吧，里面的人物决不是僵尸的复活，写这个人、演这个人，都要着眼于他或她的某个方面对于后一代的人们的启发作用……一句话，不是为了死人，而是为活人服务……作到古为今用。”这还不够清楚吗？可是吴晗同志今天偏偏回避这点，说什么《海瑞罢官》“完全是为古而古，为写戏而写戏”，这不恰恰是从反面证明吴晗同志写这出戏是怀着不可告人的目的吗？
    要害就在这里。我们说吴晗同志的自我批评没有触及到要害，从政治上说，就是没有触及到写这出戏的动机这个要害，没有触及“罢官”这个要害。单就写“罢官”影射现实这一点来说，其严重性超过了《谢瑶环》和《李慧娘》。这不是什么“为古而古”，而是“借古讽今”；不是什么“为写戏而写戏”，而是为政治而写戏；不是什么“忘掉了阶级斗争”，而是代表资产阶级、封建阶级来同无产阶级作斗争。看来吴晗同志很想痛快地发泄一下他对党和社会主义的不满，甚至认为“在戏上骂骂，痛快一下也是好的”。《海瑞罢官》正是他这个想法的实现。吴晗同志在这出戏的序里说：“一部人类社会的发展史，也就是敢想敢说敢做的人们的历史。”
  “我写剧本，看来也属于敢的一流。”海瑞不但敢说，而且敢骂。吴晗同志“学习”和“继承”了海瑞的“好的品德”，写了《海瑞罢官》，固然骂得隐晦曲折一些，究竟还是“属于敢的一流”，只是在承认自己的真实动机时稍差一些罢了。
    吴晗同志在自我批评中，是想避开政治性问题，而把自己的全部错误归结为学术问题的。当然学术问题需要进一步展开讨论，因为吴晗同志在自我批评中谈到海瑞以及清官、道德继承、历史人物评价等学术问题时，实际上认为自己是正确的，至少是基本正确的。我希望大家来就这些问题充分展开讨论。但是，政治问题是不能回避的。我并不是说吴晗同志写的全部关于海瑞的文章都有政治性错误，但是《海瑞罢官》确实是既有学术问题，又有政治性问题的。吴晗同志从歌颂海瑞为人一直到同情海瑞“罢官”，这不是偶然的。
    我是从社会实践及其效果来分析这个问题的。至于吴晗同志内心是怎么想的，还要请他自己深入检查。
