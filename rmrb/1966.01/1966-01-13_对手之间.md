    Hammering sounds, arcs of light flashing, sparks flying – a competition between rivals is in full swing on the oil station construction site.

    The head-to-head welding competition between sixth-grade welder Zhang Dageng and fourth-grade welder Fei Zhenzhong has been going on for thirteen days, and the outcome will be decided today. Zhang Dageng welded over ninety joints a day, without becoming breathless or his legs getting sore, earning him the reputation of a reliable welder. Fei Zhenzhong sought advice from him three times, and Zhang Dageng visited him for guidance five times… The more they competed, the more motivated they became, and the better the quality of their work. Everyone on the construction site knows these things, so we won't go into detail. Let's talk about today.

    Before this, Master Zhang had always been ahead of Master Fei. Yesterday, the overall result was that Zhang Dageng was ahead of Fei Zhenzhong by five joints. However, this morning, the situation changed dramatically. Master Fei went from lagging behind to being ahead, surpassing Master Zhang by five joints. At this crucial moment, Master Zhang encountered a very difficult joint to weld. If he slowed down any more, he would fall even further behind. Xiao Wang, the young apprentice learning from Master Zhang, became a little impatient. He thought: Master Zhang is always taking on the difficult joints. Since it's a competition, we can't keep giving way! He anxiously said, "We're falling behind today, we can't let it go on!" Master Zhang smiled and said, "Is socialist labor competition just about me and you? If Master Fei doesn't complete his task, it also means our task isn't completed; if Master Fei's quality is lacking, it also concerns us. One person being advanced doesn't count as being advanced; everyone being advanced is the real advancement!" Master Zhang's words made Xiao Wang nod repeatedly.

    Today, the moment of deciding the outcome of the competition is also the moment the oil station will be put into production. A little later, Master Zhang caught up with Master Fei again. Only two joints remained. At this time, Master Fei encountered a joint only three centimeters from the ground. The ground was made of cement, so it couldn't be dug. Master Fei had never welded such a confined joint before and wasn't confident. While he was pondering, Master Zhang came over and said, "Old Fei, let's switch!" Master Fei knew that Master Zhang had more experience and was confident in welding such joints. He would not only weld faster than him but also better. But he also thought that Master Zhang had taken on the difficult tasks several times, and he felt a little bad. While he was hesitating, Master Zhang said, "Old Fei, the sooner we complete the task, the sooner the oil station goes into production. We will contribute more to socialist construction and the world revolution!" Before Master Fei could answer, Master Zhang had already picked up the welding torch and started welding with a whoosh…

    After pressure testing, all six hundred or so joints were leak-proof, with excellent quality. As originally planned, the oil station was put into production five hours ahead of schedule.

    At this moment, Master Fei brought Master Zhang a bowl of hot water. "Old Zhang, drink this and let's go. I'll learn from you, and we'll compete again at the new construction site!" Xiao Wang watched the two masters walk shoulder to shoulder towards the new construction site with firm steps. He understood: another head-to-head competition, not only about quality and speed, but also about ideology and style, was about to begin. From the competition, he saw the brilliance of the communist spirit shining! So, he too took firm steps, following behind the masters, towards the new construction site…

    对手之间
    大庆油田　王基
    锤声当当，弧光闪闪，火花飞溅，在油站工地上一场对手赛正在热火地进行着。
    六级电焊工张大庚和四级电焊工费祯忠的对手挂钩赛已经进行了十三天，决定胜负就看今天了。张大庚一天焊了九十多个焊口，气不粗，腿不酸，被人称为过得硬的电焊工。费祯忠三次上门取经，张大庚也五次登门求教……他们俩是越比劲越足，越比质量越好。这些事儿，在工地上无人不知，没人不晓，咱且不表。要说的是今天。
    在这以前，张师傅始终超过费师傅，到昨儿，总的战果是张大庚超过费祯忠五个焊口。可是这一上午，情况起了急剧变化，费师傅从落后的情况下，一跃为先进，反而超过了张师傅五个焊口。正在这节骨眼上，张师傅又遇上了一个很难焊的焊口，如果再慢一点，落后得更多了。跟张师傅学手艺的青年徒工小王，有点沉不住气，他想：张师傅专挑难焊的焊口，既然是竞赛，总不能老让呀！他心急地说：“今天咱们拉后了，可不能再让了！”张师傅笑了笑说：“社会主义劳动竞赛光是我同你的事儿吗？费师傅任务要是完不成，也是我们的任务没完成；费师傅要是质量有问题，同我们也有关系。一人先进不算先进，大家先进，才算真正的先进！”张师傅一席话，说得小王不住地点头。
    今天，决定竞赛胜负的时刻，也是油站投入生产的时刻。一会儿张师傅又赶上了费师傅。仅剩下两个焊口了。这时，费师傅遇上了一个只离地面三厘米的焊口，地是水泥灌的，不能挖，费师傅焊这样的死焊口，还是头一遭，心里没把握。他正捉摸着的当儿，张师傅走过来说：“老费，咱俩换换！”费师傅深知张师傅经验比自己多，焊这样的焊口是满有把握的，不但会比自己焊得快，而且会比自己焊得好。但是他又想，张师傅几次拣重担子挑，有些过意不去。他正在犹豫，张师傅却说：“老费，我们早一分钟完成任务，油站就早一分钟投入生产，我们就为社会主义建设、世界革命多一分贡献！”不等费师傅回答，张师傅已经拿起焊把子，哗哗地焊起来了……
    经过试压，六百多个焊口点滴不漏，质量全优；按原计划，油站提前五个小时投入生产了。
    这时，费师傅给张师傅端来一碗开水。“老张，喝完走吧，我向你学习，到新的工地上咱们再较量较量！”小王看着两位师傅肩并肩地迈着坚定的步伐向新的工地走去。他懂得了：又一场不但比质量、比进度，而且比思想、比作风的对手赛要开始了。从竞赛中，他看到共产主义精神的光芒在闪烁！于是，他也迈着同样坚定的步伐，跟在师傅们的后面，向新的工地走去……
