    Xinhua News Agency, January 14th – Chen Wen-cheng, head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to China, strongly condemned the American aggressors and their puppet troops for implementing the policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all" in South Vietnam at a press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists today, massively using poisonous gas, chemical agents, white phosphorus bombs, and napalm bombs to massacre the South Vietnamese people, attempting to eliminate all life in vast areas.

    Chen Wen-cheng pointed out that these heinous crimes of US imperialism once again expose the essence of Johnson's "seeking peace." The brutal actions of the American aggressors absolutely cannot save them from their destined failure.

    Chen Wen-cheng held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists here this afternoon. He said at the meeting that the US imperialists must not use cunning means such as "unconditional negotiations" and "suspending the bombing" of North Vietnam to deceive and force the South Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and stop their war of resistance for national salvation; the US imperialists must also not use the policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all" to force the South Vietnamese people to hesitate in their struggle. Chen Wen-cheng emphasized that the South Vietnamese people will never be fooled. As long as the American bandits remain in South Vietnam, as long as the fundamental goal of the South Vietnamese people to strive for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and ultimately the reunification of the motherland has not been achieved, we will never lay down our arms. No matter how great the difficulties, no matter how great the sacrifices, even if we have to fight for ten, twenty years, or even longer, the South Vietnamese people will resolutely fight to the end.

    Chen Wen-cheng distributed the important statement issued by the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on January 5th to the reporters and answered the questions raised by the reporters.

    Chen Wen-cheng pointed out that the US's actions to expand the war of aggression in South Vietnam and Indochina have clearly demonstrated that the "Fourteen Points" plan shouted by the Johnson administration is an outdated trick, the purpose of which is to attempt to ease world public opinion, including the American people, against the Johnson gang's war policy and aggression policy, in order to cover up its frenzied actions to expand the war of aggression. Chen Wen-cheng also said that Johnson's recent State of the Union address was completely in the tone of a robber. Johnson's talk in the address about the US wanting to stay in South Vietnam is exactly the same as his "Fourteen Points" plan, thoroughly exposing the ugly face of the American aggressors.

    Chen Wen-cheng said that as in the past, British Prime Minister Wilson is once again waving the flag for the US's "Fourteen Points" plan, and Tito and his ilk are doing their best to brag about it, saying that this is the US's "active and positive action." Other lackeys of the United States are also touting Johnson's "Fourteen Points" plan and the "suspension of bombing" farce, acting as paid salesmen.

    Chen Wen-cheng said that if US imperialism truly wants to seek peace, then it should immediately withdraw the US aggressor troops and their puppet troops and all weapons and war materials from South Vietnam, immediately remove its military bases in South Vietnam, immediately and permanently stop using the air force and navy to carry out destructive warfare against North Vietnam, strictly implement the Geneva Accords, and let the Vietnamese people solve their internal affairs themselves. However, the fact is not like this. The purpose of US imperialism's vigorously promoting "peace" is to strengthen and expand the war.

    Chen Wen-cheng said that in the face of this situation, the most correct path for us, the South Vietnamese people, is to unite all the people, with one heart and one mind, to resolutely defeat the US imperialist war of aggression, to liberate the South, defend the North, and then peacefully unify the motherland, and to contribute to defending the peace and security of Indochina, Asia, and the world.

    陈文成团长在记者招待会上谴责美帝推行“三光政策”
    约翰逊残暴罪行戳穿约翰逊“和谈”骗局
    美帝休想利用“无条件谈判”、“暂停轰炸”手段，诱骗和强迫越南南方人民放下武器；也休想利用杀光、烧光、毁光政策，迫使越南南方人民在斗争中犹豫不前。
    新华社十四日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成今天在中外记者招待会上，强烈谴责美国侵略者及其仆从军队在越南南方推行杀光、烧光、毁光的政策，大规模地使用毒气、化学毒剂、白磷炸弹和凝固汽油弹，残杀越南南方人民，企图消灭广大地区内的一切生命。
    陈文成指出，美帝国主义的这些滔天罪行，又一次暴露了约翰逊的“谋求和平”的实质。美国侵略者的残暴行为，绝对挽救不了它注定失败的命运。
    陈文成今天下午在这里举行了中外记者招待会，他在会上说，美帝国主义者休想利用“无条件谈判”、“暂停轰炸”越南北方等狡猾手段，来诱骗和强迫越南南方人民放下武器，停止救国抗战；美帝国主义者也休想利用杀光、烧光、毁光的政策，来迫使越南南方人民在斗争中犹豫不前。陈文成强调说，越南南方人民决不会上当，只要美国强盗还赖在越南南方，只要越南南方人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立和进而统一祖国的根本目标还没有实现，我们就决不会放下武器。不管遇到多大的艰苦，也不管要遭到多大的牺牲，即使还要打十年、二十年或者更长的时间，越南南方人民也将坚决抗战到底。
    陈文成向记者们散发了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会在一月五日发表的重要声明，并且回答了记者们提出的问题。
    陈文成指出，美国在越南南方和印度支那扩大侵略战争的行动，已经清楚地说明，约翰逊政府叫喊的“十四点”计划是一种陈腐的骗局，其目的就是企图缓和包括美国人民在内的世界人民反对约翰逊匪帮的战争政策和侵略政策的舆论，来掩盖它扩大侵略战争的疯狂行动。陈文成还说，约翰逊最近发表的国情咨文，完全是强盗口吻。约翰逊在咨文中关于美国要赖在南越的谈话，同他的“十四点”计划一模一样，彻底暴露了美国侵略者的丑恶面目。
    陈文成说，同过去许多次一样，英国首相威尔逊这次又为美国的“十四点”计划摇旗呐喊，铁托之流也极力为此而吹嘘，说什么这是美国的“主动而积极的行动”。美国的其它走狗也为约翰逊的“十四点”计划和“暂停轰炸”的丑剧而大吹大擂，充当雇佣推销员。
    陈文成说，如果美帝国主义真正想谋求和平的话，那么它就应该立即把美国侵略军及其仆从军队以及一切武器和作战物资撤出越南南方，立即撤除它在越南南方的军事基地，立即和永远停止利用空军和海军对越南北方进行破坏性的战争，严格履行日内瓦协议，让越南人民自己解决他们的内部事务。然而事实却不是这样，美帝国主义大肆张扬“和平”的目的是为了强化和扩大战争。
    陈文成说，在这种情况面前，我们越南南方人民最正确的道路是：团结全体人民、万众一心，坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，以解放南方、保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国，并为保卫印度支那、亚洲和世界和平和安全作出贡献。
