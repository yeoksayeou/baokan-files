    Today, this newspaper reports on the notice from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the arrangements for studying Chairman Mao's writings in 1966. The notice emphasizes that in order to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, all sectors must take studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way and highlighting politics as the key link for all work; they must continue to implement the spirit of "leaders taking the lead, grasping leaders," vigorously grasping the study of Chairman Mao's writings by leading cadres, vigorously strengthening the leadership of the study by general cadres and workers, peasants, and soldiers, and placing the study of Chairman Mao's writings at the forefront of all work.
    The spirit emphasized in the notice is extremely important. Countless historical facts and practical experiences from the Chinese revolution and the world revolution prove that Mao Zedong Thought, whether in terms of breadth or depth, is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and it can solve all the fundamental problems of contemporary revolution. Currently, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way has become a conscious mass movement of unprecedented scope in history. In particular, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have many vivid facts to illustrate that they not only know how to work, how to farm, and how to fight, and actually participate in production struggles, class struggles, and scientific experiments, but also consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, seeking out the objective laws in their work and fighting and solving problems according to objective laws. Whether in the company or in the workshop, at the counter or in the production team, at the ping-pong table or in the driver's seat of a car, there are many people who have studied Mao Zedong Thought very well and applied it very flexibly. After Mao Zedong Thought was grasped by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, it became a tremendous material force, driving the high tide of industrial and agricultural production in our country, driving the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and driving the strengthening and consolidation of our national defense forces. In this situation, the Municipal Committee's proposal to continue implementing the spirit of "leaders taking the lead, grasping leaders," vigorously grasping the study of Chairman Mao's writings by leading cadres, and strengthening the leadership of the study by general cadres and workers, peasants, and soldiers has even more profound significance. If we do not grasp it in this way, theory will lag behind practice, leadership will lag behind the masses, and we will not be able to adapt to the requirements of the development of the situation.
    Vigorously grasping the study of Chairman Mao's writings by leading cadres means first of all promoting the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres. This is the key to whether we can use Mao Zedong Thought to command all work.
    With the in-depth development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, profound changes have taken place in our political, economic, cultural, educational, and other tasks. The work is becoming more in-depth and solid, and the requirements are becoming higher and higher. Leading cadres are the backbone of the revolutionary ranks. They bear important responsibilities in implementing the Party's lines, principles, and policies, in educating cadres and the masses, and in cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause. Many problems need to be solved by them by following the mass line and mobilizing the broad masses. In this situation, if leading cadres are not educated first, do not study Chairman Mao's writings well, and do not achieve ideological revolutionization, if there are still many non-proletarian ideas in their minds, and there are still many metaphysics and trivial philosophies, how can they implement the Party's lines, principles, and policies well? How can they mobilize the masses and rely on the masses? How can they cultivate good revolutionary successors? What actions can they take to influence and drive the revolutionization of general cadres and the masses?
    This year is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. A new and excellent situation is before us, and arduous and glorious tasks are on our shoulders. Only by studying Chairman Mao's writings well and achieving ideological revolutionization can leading cadres firmly establish the idea of serving the people of all of China and the world, hold high the banner of the General Line, do all work well, overcome all difficulties on the road forward, and defeat all class enemies at home and abroad.
    Leading cadres must study Chairman Mao's writings well and achieve ideological revolutionization. This is the demand of today's history, the requirement of the new situation and new tasks, and also the requirement of the fundamental cause of the Party and the people. How to study? The important thing is to put oneself into it and first use it to transform one's own thinking. Chairman Mao's writings are revolutionary theory and the highest instructions for all our work. When studying, if we do not use the arrow of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the target of our own ideological problems, and do not find out the things in our thinking that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and seriously criticize and transform them, we will not be able to gradually master Mao Zedong Thought. Studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way means making great efforts in the word "use," and first of all, making great efforts in transforming one's own thinking. Only by breaking through the barrier of ideological transformation can we be said to have grasped the key in the word "use," hit the nail on the head, and then we can understand everything and consciously permeate Mao Zedong Thought into all our work, study, and life, be consistent in word and deed, be true to ourselves, and drive the revolutionization of cadres and the masses.
    To improve the consciousness of ideological transformation, we must resolutely oppose the ideas of pride, complacency, and self-righteousness. For leading cadres, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, they must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and admit that "the enemy of learning is one's own complacency. To seriously learn something, one must start from not being complacent." We must divide ourselves into two, see that there are still problems in our thinking, bravely expose our non-proletarian ideas, expose the main contradictions in our work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, correct shortcomings, and constantly move forward. The more they are leading cadres, the more firm their stand should be, the stronger their party spirit, the more abundant their revolutionary spirit, and the more their words and actions should conform to Mao Zedong Thought. If we check according to this standard, many of our comrades still have gaps, and some people's gaps are still very large. Especially as the work develops and deepens, and many workers, peasants, and soldiers increasingly master Mao Zedong Thought, if leading cadres do not work hard to learn and keep up with Mao Zedong Thought, they will fall behind ideologically and in their work, and they will not be able to undertake leadership work. Therefore, we should be modest and prudent, vigorously grasp learning, make up our minds, squeeze out time to learn, work hard to study, and strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way to promote our own ideological revolutionization.
    We must also strengthen the leadership of the study of general cadres and the masses. For general cadres and the masses, the fundamental purpose of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way also lies in achieving ideological revolutionization. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously strengthen leadership, implement the principle of proceeding from reality, treating differently, and suiting measures to people, so that they can study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. Moreover, we must continue to grasp typical examples and establish pacesetters so that their learning can continue to improve and deepen, and so that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can better and better master Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon. We must understand that whether the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can master Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought is an important guarantee for whether socialism can finally triumph.
    We firmly believe that as long as we conscientiously take studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way and highlighting politics as the key link for all our work, vigorously grasp ideological revolutionization, first of all the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres, and realize work revolutionization from ideological revolutionization, we will surely be able to victoriously complete the tasks on all our fronts.

    活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓思想革命化
    ——北京日报一月十八日社论
    今天本报报道了中共北京市委关于一九六六年学习毛主席著作的安排的通知。通知强调指出，为了更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，各行各业都必须以活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，作为一切工作的纲；必须继续贯彻“头头抓，抓头头”的精神，狠抓领导干部对毛主席著作的学习，大力加强对一般干部和工农群众学习的领导，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。
    通知强调的精神是十分重要的。中国革命和世界革命的无数的历史事实和实践经验证明：毛泽东思想无论从内容的广度和深度上讲，都是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，它能够解决当代革命的一切根本问题。目前，活学活用毛泽东思想，已经成为历史上空前广泛的自觉的群众运动。特别是工农兵群众，更有许多人用生动事实说明：他们不仅会做工，会种地，会打仗，实际参加生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验，而且会自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，寻找自己工作中的客观规律，并按照客观规律去斗争，去解决问题。无论在连队还是在车间，在柜台还是在生产队，在乒乓球桌旁还是在汽车驾驶室里，都有很多人把毛泽东思想学得很好、用得很活。毛泽东思想为广大工农兵群众掌握以后，就变成了巨大的物质力量，带动了我国工农业生产的高涨，带动了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，带动了我国国防力量的加强和巩固。在这一形势下，市委提出继续贯彻“头头抓，抓头头”的精神，狠抓领导干部对毛主席著作的学习，加强对一般干部和工农群众学习的领导，就具有更加深远的意义。不这样抓，就会理论落后于实践，领导落后于群众，不能适应形势发展的要求。
    狠抓领导干部对毛主席著作的学习，首先就是要促进领导干部的思想革命化，这是我们能否用毛泽东思想统帅一切工作的关键。
    随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的深入发展，我们的政治、经济、文化、教育等各项工作都发生了深刻的变化，工作越来越深入、扎实，要求越来越高。领导干部是革命队伍中的骨干，在贯彻党的路线、方针、政策方面，在教育干部和群众、培养革命事业的接班人方面，他们都负有重要责任。许多问题要靠他们走群众路线、发动广大群众去解决。在这种情况下，如果领导干部不首先受教育，不学好毛主席著作，不实现思想革命化，头脑中还有不少非无产阶级思想，还有不少形而上学和烦琐哲学，他们怎么能把党的路线、方针、政策贯彻好？怎么能发动群众、依靠群众？怎么能培养好革命接班人？用什么行动来影响和带动一般干部和群众的革命化？
    今年，是第三个五年计划的第一年。新的大好形势摆在我们的面前，艰巨、光荣的任务放在我们肩上。领导干部只有学好毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，才能牢固地树立起为全中国和全世界人民服务的思想，高举总路线旗帜，把各项工作做好，战胜前进道路上的一切困难，战胜国内外一切阶级敌人。
    领导干部必须学好毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，这是今天历史的要求，是新形势、新任务的要求，也是党和人民的根本事业的要求。怎么学？重要的还是要把自己摆进去，首先用来改造自己的思想。毛主席著作是革命的理论，是我们一切工作的最高指示。学习时，不用毛泽东思想之矢，来射自己思想问题之的，不找出自己思想上不符合毛泽东思想的东西，认真地加以批判改造，就无法把毛泽东思想逐步学到手。活学活用毛泽东思想，在用字上狠下功夫，首先是在改造自己思想上狠下功夫。只有突破了思想改造这一关，才算是在用字上抓住了关键，打中了要害，才能一通百通，把毛泽东思想自觉地贯串到自己的全部工作、学习和生活中去，言行一致，表里如一，并把干部和群众的革命化带动起来。
    提高思想改造的自觉性，必须坚决反对骄傲自满、自以为是的思想。对于领导干部来说，要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，必须按照毛主席的教导，承认“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始”。对自己要一分为二，要看到自己的思想还有问题，要勇敢地揭露自己的非无产阶级思想，揭露工作中的主要矛盾，开展批评和自我批评，改正缺点，不断前进。越是领导干部，应当立场越坚定，党性越强，革命精神越充沛，言论和行动越符合毛泽东思想。如果按这个标准来检查，我们的许多同志还是有差距的，有些人的差距还很大。特别是在工作越来越发展、深入，许多工农群众日益掌握毛泽东思想的情况下，如果领导干部不努力学习，紧紧跟上毛泽东思想，就会从思想上、工作上掉队，就无法担任领导工作。因此我们应当谦虚谨慎，狠抓学习，下定决心，挤出时间学，下苦功夫钻，努力活学活用毛主席著作，促进自己思想革命化。
    我们还必须加强对一般干部和群众学习的领导。对于一般干部和群众来说，活学活用毛主席著作，根本目的也在于实现思想革命化。各级党委要认真加强领导，贯彻从实际出发，区别对待，因人制宜的原则，使他们能够把毛主席著作学得活、用得好。并且，要继续抓典型，树标兵，使他们的学习能够不断提高和深入，使广大工农兵越来越好地掌握毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器。要了解，广大工农兵群众能不能掌握马克思列宁主义理论，掌握毛泽东思想，是社会主义能不能最后胜利的重要保证。
    我们深信，只要我们认真以活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治，作为我们一切工作的纲，大抓思想革命化，首先是领导干部的思想革命化，从思想革命化实现工作革命化，就一定能够胜利地完成我们各条战线上的任务。
