    [Shandong News] In order to improve the political, technical, and cultural level of employees, various mines and factories in the Zibo Special District have established a large number of various schools and training courses to train worker cadres. Over the past year, more than 1,000 people have graduated.
    The worker short-term school run by the Mining Bureau has been held for five sessions in a row, each lasting twenty-five days. More than 600 students have graduated, all of whom were transferred from nearby mines and factories. Among the 202 students in the fifth session, 80 percent were underground workers. After studying, the workers' awareness has been improved. Thirty workers in the five sessions have honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party, and 99 cadres above the group leader level have been promoted.
    The Special District Industrial School, since its establishment in August last year, has graduated two sessions, totaling more than 230 people. All of them have been assigned to various factories and mines to participate in production and construction, and they have shown great enthusiasm in their jobs. The school currently has more than 240 students.
    The Worker Cultural School of the Military Industry Bureau No. 1 opened on November 25th with a total of 205 students. They are divided into four classes according to their cultural level. In three months, illiterate workers are required to recognize 300 characters; those with the equivalent of fifth-grade level are required to reach the level of elementary school graduation. In addition, 164 military industry workers established a worker cultural class on September 20th, which is attached to Zibo Middle School for teaching. The study period is one year, and they are striving to complete the three-year course in one year and reach the level of junior high school graduation.
