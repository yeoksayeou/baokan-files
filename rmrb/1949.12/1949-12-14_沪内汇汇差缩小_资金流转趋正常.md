　　Shanghai Interbank Exchange Rate Gap Shrinks
  　Capital Circulation Trends Towards Normalcy
    [Our Dispatch] As the liberated areas continue to expand and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in various regions becomes more frequent, Shanghai's remittance business with other regions has surged, and the exchange rate gap has narrowed significantly. According to statistics, the domestic remittances of Shanghai's public and private banks, firms, and trust companies increased by 163.39% in November compared to October. The amount remitted in increased by 153.61% compared to October. The difference between remittances in and out has decreased significantly, with November's difference being only 3.03%, a reduction of more than half compared to October's 7.01% difference. Compared to the 129% exchange rate gap in August, the situation has improved even more significantly. This not only illustrates that capital is no longer as concentrated in Shanghai as it was in the past, but also demonstrates that the work of exchanging goods between urban and rural areas has made significant progress through the active efforts of all parties, enabling the circulation of capital to begin moving towards a normal path.

　　沪内汇汇差缩小
  　资金流转趋正常
    【本报讯】随着解放地区日趋扩大，各地区城乡物资交流日益频繁，沪市与其他各地汇兑业务激增，且汇差显著缩小。据统计：上海公私营行庄及信托公司十一月份内汇：比十月份增加了百分之一六三．三九。汇入金额比十月份增加了百分之一五三．六一。汇出入差额则显著缩小，十一月份仅为百分之三．○三，比十月份汇差百分之七．○一减少一半以上。若与八月份的汇差百分之一百二十九比较，情形更见显著好转。这除了说明资金已不象过去那样集中在上海一个大城市外，更说明了城乡物资交流工作经各方面的积极努力已有长足进步，使得目前资金的流转开始走上正常道路。
