Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: Soviet representative Bafanova delivered a speech yesterday at the Asian Women's Conference on the struggle of women in Asian countries for national independence, peace, and democracy. The full text is as follows:

Dear friends and comrades!

The free and equal women of the great Soviet state have entrusted me to extend warm and heartfelt greetings to you – the participants of the Asian Women's Conference.

Soviet women also entrust me to pay tribute to you – the heroic Chinese women – because you play a significant role in the historically significant victory of the entire Chinese people.

You are exemplary role models in the struggle for freedom, for national independence, and for the happiness of your children. We are proud of your heroic actions and glorious achievements demonstrated on the front lines and in the rear. We sincerely hope that you will achieve even greater successes in the construction of a free and new China. Soviet women, like all Soviet people and the entire progressive humanity, have greeted the proclamation of the People's Republic of China with great joy, and now they extend warm greetings to the Chinese people and the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong.

Dear friends!

I think I can speak for all attendees here in saying that we are very pleased that the Asian Women's Conference can be held in Beijing, despite the exceptional difficulties and significant obstacles. This conference is of historical significance. For the first time in the history of the women's movement, progressive women representatives from fourteen Asian countries are gathered to exchange experiences and determine the correct path for women to struggle for national independence, for their own rights, and for the improvement of children's conditions.

Undoubtedly, this is only possible due to the growth of the national liberation movement in various colonies and dependent countries, and primarily due to the victory of the democratic forces in China.

With the victory of Chinese democracy, a new page has been turned not only in the history of the Chinese people but also in the history of all Asian countries oppressed by imperialism.

The victory of the Chinese people inspires millions of enslaved people in colonial and dependent countries to fight for their liberation from imperialist oppression.

The victory of the Chinese people is a new blow to the imperialist camp. This is a failure of the US imperialists' attempt to use China as a major base to dominate Asia and the Pacific region and to attack the Soviet Union.

The victory of the Chinese people strengthens the power of the democratic camp. Now, the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia and the great Soviet Union have eight hundred million people. Behind it are millions of people in every corner of the earth. This is a great and strong force.

The threat of war propaganda by imperialists has turned into actual and material measures. The ruling groups of Britain and the United States openly adopt a policy of aggression and preparation for a new war. This is manifested in their accelerated expansion of armaments, expanded military budgets, and expansion of military base networks.

The Marshall Plan for enslavement, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Pacific Alliance, which is now being prepared, all serve this policy. This policy is determined by the course of action of the representatives of Britain and the United States in the United Nations, who attempt to tear up the Soviet Union's proposals on reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and concluding a five-power treaty. Under the conditions of growing economic panic, all this means for the workers, especially for women, an increasing growth of poverty and unemployment, and a constant infringement by the ruling class on basic rights and democratic freedoms.

In July of this year, the United Nations Secretariat published the report of the "Economic Survey Committee of Asian Countries and the Far East". The report said that the economic situation in these countries after the war was much worse than before the war and was in a state "very close to bankruptcy." The production of fragile industries is decreasing, and in agriculture, both the harvest and the number of livestock are declining. Millions of people in these countries are on the verge of starvation.

The official data is like this, but every representative attending this meeting knows that the actual situation in these countries is much worse.

In Malaya, bloody terror is rampant. British soldiers are shooting completely innocent people, burning thatched huts, letting dogs eat people, and driving people into the jungle.

Listen to the groans of India.

These are the cries of Indian mothers, who only ask for one thing - bread and the minimum living conditions for their children. But according to the orders of the detestable Indian rulers, they are thrown into prison or executed for this.

French colonialists using American weapons are shooting in Vietnam, American planes are dropping bombs there, killing women and children.

Dutch invaders in British and American uniforms are ravaging Indonesian cities and villages, and they are creating bizarre bestialities.

In Burma, constant looting of the masses is taking place.

It is wrong to think that the British and American imperialists are doing their best to stifle the national liberation movements of various countries, with the sole purpose of seizing the tin mines in Malaya, the oil in Indonesia, and the rubber in Burma. Friends, things are not just here.

The American monopolists want more. They want to use your fathers, husbands and brothers as cannon fodder in the anti-Soviet war, and want to rule the world. Therefore, the enemies of peace and democracy engage in extremely shameless deception and slander, and they try their best to confuse the people of various countries, as if there is danger on the side of the Soviet Union. However, these attempts are useless, the truth cannot be concealed – the people do not want war. Mothers all over the world declare that they will never send their sons to fight the Soviet Union.

The great Russian humanist writer Gorky once wrote in his novel "Mother": "The waves of blood cannot drown the truth!" Similarly, the national liberation movement in Asian countries cannot be stopped either.

The Indian people suffering from poverty and hunger angrily rejected the evil plan of the new war instigators; the great achievements of the People's Democratic Army of Burma are growing, and the liberation struggles of the people of Vietnam and Indonesia are developing.

In Asian countries, an increasing number of women have joined the unprecedented struggle of the people of various countries for peace and national independence, against colonial oppression and new war instigators.

The women of Asia are no longer willing to tamely submit to their painful fate, no longer willing to silently and alone endure their suffering. They stand up to defend themselves and their children. They increasingly understand that to obtain their own rights and happiness, they must engage in active struggle together with all the people.

Shortly before the great October Socialist Revolution, the lives of women in our Central Asian regions were not much better than the lives of women in India, Malaya and other Asian dependent countries are now.

But now the women representatives of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan are all representatives of this conference. Atani Pesova is the Minister of Social Insurance, Nai Ilyasova Basanova is a university professor and representative of the Supreme Soviet, and Mikhlinis Ubaidulayeva is a socialist labor hero. In the past, she was a collective farm member, and now she is a student at the Agricultural College. These are the women who the Soviet regime elevated from the veil and seclusion, from ignorance and lack of rights to the highest peak of knowledge and culture. There are tens of thousands of such women in our country.

Women in the Central Asian Soviet Republics, like women throughout the Soviet Union, are building the most beautiful human society - communism - hand in hand with men. They participate in the administration of the country, work in various socialist enterprises and collective farms, and create their own national forms and cultures with socialist content. They are cared for by the Soviet government and the Communist Party. A wide range of nurseries, kindergartens, children's clubs, children's palaces, theaters and sanatoriums have been set up for their children.

Women in Asian countries know that the women's question can only be thoroughly resolved and women can become equal members of society only in places where the people control their own destiny. The Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, North Korea, Mongolia and China are clear evidence. Therefore, the purpose of our conference is to enable us to correctly estimate the strength of progressive women's organizations in Asian countries, and to formulate our main basic tasks, which women's organizations in various countries should strive to implement.

At the present stage, the decisive task for women's organizations in colonial countries and dependent countries is to unite all women and put them into the active struggle for their national independence.

The struggle of Asian women for peace, national independence, democracy and bread cannot be separated from the struggle of democratic women all over the world.

Women all over the world also have a firm and powerful weapon in the struggle - the Women's International Democratic Federation. Since its establishment, the Women's International Democratic Federation has supported and assisted Asian women in their struggle for peace and national independence. We must strengthen the connection between Asian democratic women's organizations and the Women's International Democratic Federation day by day.

Dear friends: On behalf of Soviet women, I would also like to assure the conference that Asian women can be sure of the friendly support of the Soviet people at any time and in anything. We warmly sympathize with your struggle. When you are living and struggling in difficulties, please remember: you have loyal friends - the Soviet people.

It is not we, but the imperialists and aggressors who are afraid of war.

Long live the strong unity of world democratic women!

Fight more bravely and resolutely for peace!

Long live the People's Republic of China and Chairman Mao!

Long live the consolidation of the world peace and democracy camp led by the great Soviet Union, headed by the friend and leader of the people all over the world, Stalin!

　　苏联代表巴菲诺娃在亚洲妇代会议上
    关于亚洲各国妇女争取民族独立、和平及民主斗争的发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】苏联代表巴菲诺娃昨日在亚洲妇女代表会议上作了关于亚洲各国妇女争取民族独立、和平及民主斗争的发言。全文如下：亲爱的朋友们同志们！
    伟大的苏维埃国家底自由及平等的妇女委托我向你们——亚洲妇女代表会议的参加者致以热烈的，衷心的敬礼。
    苏联妇女也委托我向你们——英勇的中国妇女致敬，因为你们在全中国人民的有历史意义的胜利中起着重大的作用。
    你们是争取自由，争取民族独立及孩子们的幸福斗争中的模范榜样。我们为你们在战争的前线及后方所表现的英雄行为及光荣的功绩感到骄傲，我们衷心地希望你们在自由新中国的建设事业中取得更大的成就。苏联妇女，象全体苏联人民及整个进步人类一样，曾以极大的欢欣迎接了中华人民共和国的宣告成立，现在他们向中国人民及中华人民共和国领袖毛泽东致以热烈的敬礼。亲爱的朋友们！
    我想，我是可以代表这里的所有出席者的意见说，我们都非常满意亚洲妇女代表会议之能够在北京召开，虽然曾经有着异常的困难及重要阻碍。这次会议有着历史性的意义。亚洲十四个国家的进步妇女代表在妇女运动史上第一次地聚会一堂，为交流经验并确定妇女为争取民族独立，争取自身权利及改善儿童的状况的正确斗争途径。
    毫无疑问，这只有由于各殖民地及附属国家的民族解放运动的增长，并首先是由于中国民主力量的胜利才是可能的。
    随着中国民主主义的胜利，不仅掀开了中国人民的，而且是所有被帝国主义所压迫的亚洲各国人民历史的新的一页。
    中国人民的胜利鼓舞着殖民地及附属国家的千百万被奴役的人民为争取自己从帝国主义压迫下的解放而斗争。
    中国人民的胜利对帝国主义阵营是一个新的打击，这是美帝国主义者企图利用中国作为主要基地以统治亚洲及太平洋区域，并对苏联进攻的计划的失败。
    中国人民的胜利增强了民主阵营的力量。现在欧亚两洲各人民民主国家及伟大的苏联已经有了八万万人。在它的后面还有千百万地球各角落的人民，这是一个伟大而坚强的力量。
    帝国主义者战争宣传上的威胁，已转为事实上的和物资措施上的威胁。英美的统治集团公然地采取侵略与准备新战争的政策。这都表现在他们加速的扩充军备，扩大军事预算，和扩大军事基地网上。
    马歇尔的奴役计划，北大西洋公约以及现在正准备组织的太平洋联盟，都为这一政策而服务。这种政策是以英美两国出席联合国的代表们的行动路线来决定的，他们企图撕毁苏联关于减缩军备，禁用原子武器和订立五强和约的建议。在日益增长的经济恐慌的条件之下，这一切对于劳动者，首先是对于妇女来说，意味着贫困和失业更加增长，意味着统治阶级对于基本权利和民主自由的不断侵害。
    本年七月联合国秘书处公布了“亚洲国家及远东经济状况调查委员会”的报告。报告中说，战后这些国家的经济情形比战前坏得多，并且处在“非常近于破产”的境地。脆弱的工业的生产在降低，在农业方面，收获量和畜类的数目都在低落。这些国家的千百万的人民濒于饿毙。
    官方的资料是如此，但是出席这个会议的每位代表都知道，实际上这些国家情况更要坏得多。
    在马来亚，血腥的恐怖正在横行。英国士兵射杀着完全无辜的人民，焚烧着茅舍，纵狗吃人，把人们赶到丛林里去。
    请听一下印度的呻吟吧。
    这是印度母亲们在哭泣，她们只要求一件事情——面包和自己孩子们的最低生活条件。但是根据可憎的印度统治者们的命令，为了这些便把她们投到监牢里或者枪决。
    使用美国武器的法国殖民者们在越南射杀着，美国飞机在那里投炸弹，杀害着妇女和儿童。
    穿着英美军装的荷兰侵略者们蹂躏着印尼的城市和乡村，他们制造着奇异的兽行。
    在缅甸正进行着对群众的不断的劫掠。
    如果认为英美帝国主义者极力窒息各国人民的民族解放运动，其目的仅仅是想要夺取马来亚的锡矿，印尼的石油和缅甸的橡皮，这种想法是不对的。朋友们，事情不仅仅在此。
    美国的独占者们想要更多的东西。他们想利用你们的父亲，丈夫和弟兄去充当反苏战争中的炮灰，想使全世界归其统治。因此，和平和民主的敌人们就进行十分无耻的欺骗和毁谤，他们极力企图迷惑各国人民，仿佛在苏联那方面存在着危险。然而，他们的这些企图是无用的，真理是不能掩盖的——人民不愿意战争。全世界的母亲们宣告说，她们永远不送自己的儿子去和苏联作战。
    俄国伟大的人道主义作家高尔基在他的长篇小说“母亲”中曾经写道：“血的浪涛是淹没不了真理的！”同样地，亚洲各国的民族解放运动也是制止不了的。
    在贫困与饥饿中熬煎的印度人民愤怒的拒绝了新战争挑拨者底罪恶计划；缅甸人民的人民民主军队的伟大成就正在增长，越南和印尼人民底解放斗争正在开展。
    亚洲各国，日益增多的大批妇女都参加了各国人民争取和平及民族独立，反对殖民地压迫及新战争挑拨者的空前的斗争。
    亚洲的妇女们再不愿意驯服地顺从自己痛苦的命运，再不愿意不声不响的，单独地忍受自己的遭遇了。她们挺起身来保卫她们自己和她们的孩子们，她们越来越了解：要获得本身的权利及幸福只有同全体人民一起从事积极的斗争。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命不久以前，我国中亚细亚地区的妇女的生活并不比印度、马来亚及其他亚洲附属国里妇女现在的生活好得多少的。
    但是现在乌兹别克，土克曼，吉尔吉斯，哈萨克斯坦的妇女代表们都是这次代表会议的代表。阿塔尼佩索娃是社会保险部的部长，娜伊丽亚索娃·巴萨诺娃是一位大学教授和最高苏维埃的代表，米赫林尼斯·乌巴伊杜拉耶娃是位社会主义劳动英雄，过去她是一个集体农庄庄员，现在她是农业学院的学生。这便是那些妇女，苏维埃政权将她们从面纱和幽闭中，从无知识无权利提高到知识和文化的最高峰。这样的妇女在我们国家里有成千成万的。
    中亚细亚苏维埃共和国的妇女，象全苏联的妇女一样，她们与男子们携手并肩地建设着最美丽的人类社会——共产主义。她们参加了国家的管理，在各种社会主义企业及集体农庄里工作，并创造了她们自己的民族形式和社会主义内容的文化。她们受到苏联政府和共产党的关怀。为她们的孩子们设立了广泛的托儿所，幼稚园，儿童俱乐部，儿童宫，戏院及休养院等。
    亚洲各国的妇女们知道：只有在人民自己掌握了自己命运的地方，妇女问题才能彻底解决，妇女才能成为平等的社会成员。苏联，各人民民主国家，北朝鲜，蒙古及中国——便是显明的证据。因此，我们代表会议的目的在于使我们正确的估计亚洲各国妇女进步团体的力量，并拟定我们的主要的基本任务，各国妇女团体都应该为执行这些任务而奋斗。
    在现阶段对于殖民地国家与附属国妇女团体的决定性的任务，是团结一切的妇女群众，并使他们投入为自己民族独立的积极斗争中。
    亚洲妇女为和平、民族独立、民主与面包的斗争，是不能和全世界民主妇女的斗争分离的。
    全世界的妇女在斗争中，也有坚实而有力的武器——国际民主妇联。国际民主妇联由自己成立之日起，就支持并援助亚洲各国妇女为和平与民族独立的斗争。我们要一天一天地巩固亚洲民主妇女团体与国际民主妇联的联系。
    亲爱的朋友们：我代表苏联妇女还要向代表会议保证，亚洲妇女无论何时，和任何事情，都可以确信苏联人民的友谊的支援。我们热烈地同情你们的斗争，当你们生活和斗争困难的时候，请记着：你们有忠实的朋友——苏联人民。
    不是我们，而是帝国主义者和侵略者惧怕战争。
    世界民主妇女的坚强团结万岁！
    更勇敢更坚决地为和平而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国及毛主席万岁！
    以全世界人民的朋友和领袖斯大林所领导的伟大苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营巩固万岁！（附图片）
