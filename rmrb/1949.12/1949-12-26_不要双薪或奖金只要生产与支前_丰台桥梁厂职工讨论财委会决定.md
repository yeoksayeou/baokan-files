"Don't Want Double Pay or Bonuses, Just Production and Support the Front"
Fengtai Bridge Factory Workers Discuss the Financial and Economic Committee's Decision
　　In the past, without extra pay, you couldn't celebrate the New Year; now we have enough to eat and wear, and it's no longer necessary.
　　[Our Newspaper] After seeing the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee's handling measures for year-end double pay or bonuses and the All-China Federation of Labor's letter to workers, all employees of the Fengtai Bridge Factory, under the leadership of the trade union's study committee, immediately launched heated discussions. Now everyone has a clear understanding of this issue. For the sake of long-term interests, they resolutely refuse double pay or bonuses and will work hard to produce and support the front. The sixth group even specifically proposed: "We not only don't want double pay, but we will also actively purchase Victory Bonds."

　　In the discussion, everyone connected the past with the present. Electrician Pan Furong said: In the past, we lived a life of climbing mountains of knives; now we have security and no problems with living. The country is under construction and there is no need for double pay. Youth League member Comrade Ma Hong said: I never had enough to eat before. After liberation, I not only have enough to eat, but also have a surplus, and I don't need this money at all. Model worker Wang Xincheng said on the train to Jinxi River: During the Japanese and Kuomintang periods, I worked for twenty-five years. At that time, someone was in charge of work, but no one was in charge of welfare. Now that the Communist Party has come, coal, firewood, and clothing are distributed regularly, and the superiors take care of us extremely well. I resolutely don't want this double pay. Worker Li Changquan said: In the past, without extra pay, we couldn't eat New Year dumplings. But it's different now. The People's Government often takes care of us workers, so it's no longer necessary. The fourth group said: In the past, we workers were oppressed, and year-end double pay and bonuses were obtained through struggle, so we workers should ask the ruling class for it. Now we are the leading class, the working class is the master. We know that the country's finances are still difficult, and the country takes good care of us now. We can live without double pay or bonuses. We all resolutely don't want double pay or bonuses.

　　Why Eat the Eggs Instead of Hatching Chickens? It's Not Too Late to Enjoy It When the Country Becomes Prosperous.

　　Comrade Wang Guiyi gave a small example at the discussion, he said: Is it better to eat five eggs, or keep them to hatch chicks? When the chickens grow up and lay eggs, the eggs hatch chickens, and the chickens lay eggs. If we continue like this, it will no longer be a problem for us to eat eggs again. Double pay is also like this. If this money is distributed to us, it will be gone after everyone spends it casually, but if it is handed over to the government for construction, when the country becomes prosperous, is it too late for us to enjoy it? Comrade Zhao Desheng also gave an example: Are we, as shareholders of a shop, better off dividing the year-end dividends, or using the money to buy more goods and expand our business? Study worker Zhang Shushen said: The current treatment is different from the past. We get as much as we deserve, and there is no need to give us extra money. If we take it, it will be scattered among individuals, and the effect will not be great, but if it is concentrated in the government, it will be a large sum of money, which can be used for some construction projects. In the future, as the country's construction progresses, the treatment will naturally improve, and we will enjoy it permanently then!

　　The Working Class Should Greet the First Year of New China's Construction with the Attitude of Masters

　　Youth League branch secretary Song Chunlu also wrote down his thoughts. He said: We, the working class, should first understand that now we should take the attitude of masters to take care of the country's difficulties and consider the lives of the people across the country. If double pay is issued, the country will have to print more money and collect more taxes from the people, and prices will definitely rise. We should also take care of our compatriots in the disaster areas, who are suffering from cold and hunger. The soldiers at the front are fighting the reactionaries to win national liberation, and their treatment is far inferior to ours. We should use this money for construction in 1950. Worker Ding Yuan said: Although I have a large family, I resolutely don't want it, because our current life is much better than that of our peasant brothers. Everyone thinks that if the Communist Party hadn't come, with this year's severe disaster, we probably wouldn't even be able to eat bran! Worker Qiang Tingzhang said: Don't take this bonus, use it to build industries, so that unemployed workers can go to work. Clerk Qiao Zhan＠ said: The Liberation War is coming to an end, and next year will be the first year of large-scale construction. We need to vigorously develop industry and transportation. If we still want this money, it will not only fail to alleviate the government's difficulties, but will increase them. This is not the attitude of a master, we must not take it! Beam-making foreman Zhang Guangxi said: 1950 is the first year of construction in our new China, and the country needs a lot of expenditure. We can use this year-end double pay money for construction and vigorously develop construction.

　　After this discussion, all the factory's employees understood that in the past, when they were slaves and beasts of burden to the reactionary rulers, the workers only obtained double pay or bonuses through struggle, but this was blood extracted from the workers. Now, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the workers have turned over and become masters, and their lives are gradually improving, so they no longer need to ask for double pay or bonuses. We should help the country overcome the current financial difficulties, use the spirit of sacrificing self for the public, promote the fine tradition of diligence and hard work, live frugally, actively produce, and overcome this temporary difficulty to strive for a permanently happy future. Therefore, all the factory employees unanimously stated that they resolutely do not want year-end double pay or bonuses, and hope that class brothers will act together.

　　“不要双薪或奖金只要生产与支前”
　  丰台桥梁厂职工讨论财委会决定
  　以前没又薪，就不能过年；现在有吃有穿，已经用不着了。
    【本报讯】丰台桥梁厂全体职工在看到政务院财经委员会关于年终双薪或奖金处理办法及全总发表的告工人书以后，在工会学委会的领导下，马上展开了热烈的讨论，现在大家对这个问题都有了清楚的认识，为了长远的利益，坚决不要双薪或奖金，而要努力生产支前。第六小组还特别提出：“我们不但不要双薪，而且要踊跃购买胜利公债。”
    大家在讨论中联系到过去与现在的生活。电工潘福荣说：过去是过着爬刀山的日子；现在有了保障，生活没有问题，国家正在建设，不需要双薪了。青年团员马洪同志说：我从前根本不够吃。解放后，我不但够吃，而且有富余，一点也用不着这笔钱了。劳模王新成在去金溪河的火车上讨论时说：在日本和国民党时期，我作过二十五年工，那时是有人管干活，没人管福利。现在共产党来了，平时煤、柴、衣服都发给，上级照顾我们周到极了。这笔双薪我坚决不要。工友李长泉说：过去没双薪，就不能吃这顿年饺子。现在不然了，现在人民政府经常照顾咱们工人，已经不用要了。第四组说：在以前我们工人阶级是被压迫的，年终双薪及奖金是我们经过斗争得来的，所以我们工人应该向统治阶级要。现在我们是领导阶级，工人阶级是主人，我们知道国家财政还困难，现在国家对我们照顾的很周到，吃的饱，穿的暖，不需要双薪或奖金就可以生活了，我们全体坚决不要双薪或奖金。
    吃鸡蛋那如多孵鸡？国家富强了再享受并不晚
    王桂一同志在讨论会上举了一个小例子，他说：有五个鸡蛋我们吃了好呢？还是留着孵小鸡好呢？鸡长大下蛋，蛋孵鸡，鸡下蛋，这样不去，我们再吃鸡蛋就不成问题了。双薪也是这样的，这笔钱给我们分了，大家随便一化就没了，可是交给政府拿去建设，国家富强了，咱们再享受还晚吗？赵德生同志也举了一个例子说：我们这些人都是掌柜的股东，年终的红利，都把它分了好呢？还是拿这笔钱再购买货物，扩充营业好呢？学习工务员张树身说：现在的待遇和从前不同，应得多少就给多少，不需要另外再给钱了。如果要了，分散在各个人身上，作用不大，可是集中在政府，就是一笔大款项，很可干一部分建设事业。将来国家建设进步，待遇自然提高，到那时就永久的享受了！
    工人阶级要以主人翁的态度迎接新中国建设的第一年
    青年团支书宋淳录并把他的感想写了出来。他说：我们工人阶级应当首先了解到现在我们应当拿出主人翁的态度来照顾国家困难，更要顾虑到全国人民的生活。假如发给双薪，国家就要多印票子，和多收人民的捐税，物价一定也要上涨。我们更应照顾到灾区的同胞们，他们受冻挨饿。前线的战士们为争取全国解放与反动派作斗争，他们的待遇远不及我们。我们应该把这笔款用作一九五○年的建设事业。工友丁源同志说：我虽然人口多，我也坚决不要，因为我们现在的生活比农民弟兄还强的多。大家想想共产党到现在如果不来，今年的灾情这样重，恐怕我们连糠也吃不上的呢！工友强廷章说：这个奖金不要，用来建设工业，叫失业的工人都能上班。办事员乔占＠说：解放战争就快结束，明年将是大建设的第一年，要大力发展工业、交通。我们再要这笔钱，不但没给政府减轻困难，反倒增加了困难，这不是主人翁的态度，一定不要！制梁工长张广喜说：一九五○年是我们新中国建设第一年，国家大量需用开支，我们可以把这些年终双薪的钱用在建设方面，大力开展建设。
    全厂职工经过了这次讨论，都明白了过去给反动统治者当奴隶，当牛马，工人经过斗争才得到了双薪或奖金，但这是由工人身上榨取出来的血液，现在工人在共产党毛主席的正确领导下，已经翻身当了主人，生活逐渐在改善，就可以不需要再要双薪或奖金，我们应当帮助国家战胜目前的财政困难，用舍私为公的精神，发扬勤苦耐劳的优良传统，节衣缩食，积极生产，渡过这个暂时的困难，来争取永久幸福的将来。因此全厂职工一致表示坚决不要年终双薪或奖金，并希望阶级兄弟们一致行动起来。
