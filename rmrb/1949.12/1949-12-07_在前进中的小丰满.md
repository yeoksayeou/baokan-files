　　Small Bountifulness in Progress
　　Xu Guming

　　“Changbai Mountain, so high, the Songhua River's waters surge and roar,
　　The river rushes past Fengman, a hundred-meter dam cuts its waist,
　　Above the dam, it becomes Songhua Lake, below, a power station is built.”
　　This is the hydroelectric power station praised by the workers of Fengman.

　　Returned to the People
　　The Fengman Hydroelectric Power Station was built by Japanese imperialism after the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, to further plunder the Northeast and develop its resources on a large scale, and construction began in 1937. At that time, Japanese imperialism directly used force to conscript people from all over the Northeast to work, but only gave them extremely low wages. The workers lived inhuman lives under the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese invaders and their lackeys, working in the freezing cold of forty degrees below zero, suffering from hunger and cold, and facing starvation and death all year round. According to incomplete statistics, deaths occurred every day. According to old workers and nearby residents, since the start of construction, more than 10,000 workers have died. The "Ten Thousand People Pit" on Fengman East Mountain is the eternal resting place of the nameless working people who created this project. In 1945, the Soviet army liberated the Northeast, and the workers of Fengman endured eight years of darkness, seeing the light for the first time. However, soon, the Kuomintang bandit army came, and the workers fell into the abyss of suffering again. It was not until March 9th last year, when the People's Liberation Army liberated Fengman, that the workers here permanently ended their days of suffering and inhuman lives. This insulted and damaged Fengman—the hydroelectric power station built with the blood and sweat and lives of thousands upon thousands of working people—returned to the hands of the people, serving the construction of New China.

　　The Attitude of the Masters
　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers are now actively engaged in production and construction with the attitude of masters. Worker representatives participate in the Management Committee of the Fengman Hydroelectric Power Bureau and the Management Committees of the two factories under it, the Power Plant and the Dam Construction Plant. Excellent and active worker cadres are promoted to administrative positions. For example, Dong Wenbin, a worker who led the struggle against unreasonable wages during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, has now been promoted to deputy chief of the Materials Section.

　　The workers have organized a trade union (the center of all political and cultural activities), and 1,400 workers are closely united around it.

　　In order to improve the workers' political, cultural, and technical levels, a study committee has been organized, jointly planned and led by the Party, administration, and trade union. They organize workers to study politics and culture, and also conduct vocational studies according to the different conditions of each unit to help workers progress.

　　In order to support and launch employee recreational activities, the trade union has organized an amateur cultural troupe. Employees are most interested in theatrical activities. In the past year, they have performed more than 20 large and small dramas. The cultural troupe also has a writing group to encourage and guide workers to write. This year, at the Jilin Arts Competition, the drama "Model Resident Group" performed by the workers of Fengman was a collective creation of the workers, written, directed, and performed by themselves. This performance won first prize. The singing program of the Fengman workers' choir also won first prize at the competition. This is solid proof that the workers' cultural level has greatly improved.

　　Now, the workers' material lives are also being improved as much as possible under the given conditions. For example, in the past, during the puppet Manchurian period, workers ate chaff and corn. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, their wages were not even enough to buy bean cakes, and later even these meager wages were in arrears, and the workers could only starve. But now, a worker with an average wage can support a family of four, and can eat meat and rice once or twice a week. Skilled technicians or those with smaller families can often eat refined grains. The newly built workers' residences are clean, bright, and tidy brick and tile houses, complete with water and electricity, with heated brick beds, and separate bedrooms and kitchens, forming a stark contrast to the dilapidated thatched sheds where workers lived during the Kuomintang rule.

　　The public has established hospitals, cooperatives, employee canteens, employee children's schools, clubs, and libraries for the workers. The welfare of the employees is well taken care of. If workers are sick, all medical expenses are paid by the public. If family members of workers are sick, the public pays 50% of the medical expenses. Labor insurance benefits have been implemented since April of this year. There are death benefits for deaths due to work-related causes, and there are also family relief funds for deaths not due to work-related causes. Those disabled due to work continue to receive their salaries, and elderly employees over the age of 60 receive subsidies. The workers' lives are fully guaranteed.

　　In the puppet Manchurian era and during the Kuomintang rule, deaths and accidents occurred every day. The death of a worker was like the death of a dog. The oppressors and exploiters did not care about the lives of the workers at all. Now, under the new regime, due to the leadership's attention to improving working conditions, only one accident has occurred in the year since liberation: technician Zhu Bingkun accidentally fell and died. The Labor Insurance Committee gave his family ten years' worth of death benefits according to labor insurance regulations, paid annually, and all funeral expenses were paid by the public. In addition, some land was allocated to his family to grow vegetables to supplement their household income, and attention was paid to the education of his sixteen-year-old son, allowing him to study mechanics at the Hydroelectric Power Bureau. Furthermore, at the funeral, the director and deputy director of the Hydroelectric Power Bureau, the directors of the Power Plant and the Dam Construction Plant, and the responsible comrades of the trade union personally carried the coffin and shoveled earth. The family of the deceased was very grateful. The workers were deeply moved, and their production enthusiasm was greatly enhanced. Everyone said, "Now everything is guaranteed, and the public takes care of everything. We can only work with peace of mind and work hard."

　　Time, Moving Forward
　　In order to complete the three-year plan for dam construction in advance in two years, the Dam Construction Plant launched a shock movement on October 17th of this year. The workers worked day and night, racing against time.

　　In this shock movement, the workers put forward four guarantees: (1) Guarantee quality and complete quantity; (2) Improve technical level; (3) Ensure safety and no accidents; (4) Ensure saving materials. They fulfilled these four guarantees through hard work, innovation, and invention.

　　Model worker Wu Xiang is a deaf-mute person. In the shock movement, he challenged his comrades with astonishing production records. In the "Red May" production competition this year, the highest record was eight models per person per day. In this shock movement, he made eighteen models every day, and encouraged others, raising the entire class to a record of fifteen per day.

　　Cui Ruqian, a recent university graduate, and veteran worker Song Dajun jointly designed a sand and gravel separation screen. In this shock movement, thanks to the encouragement and full support of the leadership, the screen was successfully tested, improving the quality of the concrete and saving cement. The success of this experiment not only played a role in promoting the shock work, but also had great political significance, pointing out a correct path—the combination of technicians and workers, breaking the conservative idea that it was impossible to exceed the technical level of the puppet Manchurian period, and encouraging workers to boldly invent and create.

　　"We are prepared to continue the dam construction work at thirty degrees below zero, and guarantee the completion of the three-year construction plan within two years. Our task is not only to complete the construction of the Fengman Hydroelectric Power Station, but also to train a large number of cadres and technical talents so that hydroelectric power stations can be built all over the country in the future," said the responsible comrades of the Fengman Hydroelectric Power Bureau in unison. They are not only full of confidence in the construction of Fengman, but also place unlimited hope in the vision of hydroelectric power stations spreading throughout China.

　　在前进中的小丰满
    徐谷明
    “长白山，高又高，松花江水浪涛涛，
    江水急流过丰满，百米高的堰堤拦断腰，
    堤上变成松花湖，堤下修成发电站。”
    这就是小丰满的工人们所歌颂的水力发电站。
    回到人民手里
    小丰满水电站是“九一八”事变后，日本帝国主义为了进一步对东北实施残酷的掠夺，大量开发东北的资源，于一九三七年动工修建的。当时，日本帝国主义直接利用武力强征东北各地人民来做工，但只给予极低的工资。工人们在日寇及其爪牙的压迫和剥削下，度着非人的生活，在零下四十度的酷寒季节里，挨冻受饿地在鞭笞下工作，终年面临着饥饿和死亡。据不完全的统计，每天都有死亡事件发生。据老工人及附近的居民说，动工以来，死亡的工人达一万名以上，丰满东山的“万人坑”，就是创建本工程的无名劳动人民的永远安息地。一九四五年苏军解放东北，小丰满的工人们熬过了八年黑暗的岁月，第一次见到了光亮。但，不久，国民党匪军来了，工人们又堕入苦难的深渊，直到去年三月九日，人民解放军解放丰满，这里的工人们才永远结束了苦难的日子和非人的生活。这被侮辱的被损害的小丰满——千千万万劳动人民用血汗和生命筑成的水电站才回到了人民的手里，为新中国的建设而服务。
    主人翁的态度
    在共产党的领导下，工人们现在是以主人翁的姿态，积极从事生产从事建设。小丰满水电局的管理委员会以及下属发电厂、筑堤厂两个工厂的管理委员会都有工人代表参加，优秀的积极的工人干部被提拔到负行政责任的岗位上去，如董文彬是一个在国民党反动统治时领导过反不合理工薪的斗争的工人，现在被提升为材料股的副股长。
    工人们组织了工会（一切政治、文化活动的中心），一千四百名工人紧紧团结在它的周围。
    为提高工人们的政治水平文化水平和技术水平，组织了学习委员会，由党、行政、工会三方面共同筹划和领导，组织工人们来学习政治和文化，更按各单位不同的条件进行业务学习，以帮助工人的进步。
    工会为了支持与发动职工文娱活动，组织了业余文工团。职工对戏剧活动最感兴趣，一年来演出了大小话剧二十多个，文工团下还设有创作组，鼓励并指导工人们写作。今年在吉林文艺竞赛会上，小丰满工人们演出的话剧“模范居民组”，就是工人们的集体创作，由工人们自编、自导、自演。这次演出获得了一等奖。小丰满工人们的合唱队的歌唱节目，在比赛会上，也获得了一等奖。这就是工人们的文化水平大为提高的铁证。
    现在工人的物质生活也在可能条件下尽量改善了。如在过去伪满时期，工人们吃糠，吃玉蜀黍，国民党反动统治时，工资不够吃豆饼，后来甚至连这点可怜的工资也拖欠着不发，工人们只有挨饿。而现在呢，一个中等工资的工人可以养活四口之家，每星期还可以吃一两次肉和大米饭，熟练的技工或家庭人口较少者可以经常吃细粮。新盖的工人住宅是洁白、明亮、整齐的砖瓦房子，里面水电俱全，有炕床，同时卧室和厨房分开；与国民党统治时期工人所住的那些破烂不堪的茅草棚子形成强烈的对照。
    公家为工人们设立了医院、合作社、职工食堂、职工子弟学校、俱乐部、图书馆。对职工的福利照顾得很周到，工人们有疾病，医药费全部由公家负担，工人家属治病，公家负担百分之五十的医药费。今年四月起实行劳保待遇，因公死亡有抚血金，非因公死亡也有家属救济金，因公残废照常领薪，年在六十以上的老年职工有补助金。工人生活完全有了保障。
    在伪满时代和国民党统治时期，每天都有死亡事件和意外发生，死一个工人好比死一条狗，压迫者剥削者根本不关心工人们的死活。现在，在新政权下，由于领导上注意改善劳动条件，解放后一年来，只发生过一次意外，技工朱炳坤失足摔死。劳保委员会按照劳保条例给予家属十年抚血金，按年发给，安葬费全部由公家负担。另外又分给他的家属一些地种菜以补助家用，照顾到他底十六岁的儿子的教育，让他进水电局学习机械。并且在葬礼中，水电局的正副局长、发电厂和巩堤厂的厂长以及工会的负责同志亲自为他抬棺铲土，死者的家属非常感激。工人们都深深感动，生产情绪大为提高，大家都说：“现在一切有了保障，公家样样照顾到，我们只有安心工作，努力工作。”
    时间，前进
    为了使筑堤方面的三年计划提前于两年完成，本年十月十七日起，筑堤厂展开了突击运动，工人们日以继夜的工作，与时间竞赛。
    工人们在这次突击运动中提出了四项保证：（一）保证质量，完成数量；（二）提高技术水平；（三）保证安全不出事故；（四）保证节省材料。他们以努力加工，发明创造来履行这四项保证。
    模型工吴祥是一个哑人，在突击运动中他用惊人的生产纪录向同志们挑战。在今年红五月的生产竞赛中，最高的纪录是每人每日做八个模型，他在这次突击运动中，每天做到十八个模型，并且鼓励别人，使全班人都提高到每天做十五个的纪录。
    崔汝谦，一个新参加工作的大学毕业生，与老工人宋大钧共同设计了一个沙石选别筛。在这次突击运动中，由于领导上的鼓励与全力支持，这筛子试验成功，提高了混凝土的质量，并且节省了洋灰。这试验的成功不仅在突击工作上起了推进的作用，而且具有极大的政治意义，它指示出一条正确的道路——技术人员与工人的结合，打破了那些认为不可能超过伪满时期的技术水平的保守观念，鼓励工人们大胆地发明创造。
    “我们准备在零下三十度时仍继续进行筑堤工作，保证三年建设计划于两年内完成。我们的任务不仅是要完成小丰满水电站的建设，并且要培养大批干部和技术人才，以便将来在全国各地建设水电站”丰满水电局负责同志异口同声地说，他们不仅对小丰满的建设充满着信心，并且对于中国各地遍布水电站的远景寄予无限的希望。
