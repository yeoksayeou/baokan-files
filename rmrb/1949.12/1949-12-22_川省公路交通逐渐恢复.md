　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 20th — Road transportation in Sichuan Province, centered around Chongqing, is gradually recovering. The five main highway lines of Sichuan-Hunan, Sichuan-Guizhou, Chengdu-Chongqing, Hanzhong-Chongqing, and the eastern Sichuan-Yunnan roads, total more than 1,960 kilometers within Sichuan Province, of which 1,800 kilometers are now completely under the control of the People's Liberation Army. When the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated from these highways, they destroyed important bridges, caves, and ferry boats along the way. Thanks to the day and night repairs by our troops pursuing the bandits, the people along the roads, and the workers of the Highway Bureau, all of them can be restored to traffic in a short period of time. Vehicles are constantly traveling on the Haitangxi to Qijiang section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, and the section south of Qijiang will also be open to traffic soon. Postal vehicles and passenger cars are traveling between Chongqing and Neijiang on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. The Daxian to Chongqing section of the Hanzhong-Chongqing Highway is open to traffic. Passenger cars have been traveling in sections on the Sichuan-Hunan Highway since the beginning of this month. The eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road is also open to traffic in sections.

　　川省公路交通逐渐恢复
    【新华社重庆二十日电】以重庆为中心的川省公路交通在逐步恢复中。川湘、川黔、成渝、汉渝和川滇东路等五条公路干线，在川省境内者共长一千九百六十余公里，其中已有一千八百公里完全为解放军控制。国民党匪军从这些公路干线上溃退时，曾将沿途的重要桥梁、山洞和轮渡渡船加以破坏。在我追歼匪的部队、沿路人民和公路局工人的日夜抢修下，短期即可全部恢复通车。川黔公路海棠溪至綦江一段已有车辆不断来往，綦江以南不日亦可通车。成渝公路重庆内江间已有邮车和客车来往。汉渝公路达县至重庆一段已通车。川湘公路于本月初即有客车分段来往。川滇东路亦已分段通车。
