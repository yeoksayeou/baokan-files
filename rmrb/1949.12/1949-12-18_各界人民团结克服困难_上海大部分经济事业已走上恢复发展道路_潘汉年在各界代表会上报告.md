　　All Sectors of the People Unite to Overcome Difficulties
  　Most of Shanghai's Economic Undertakings Have Embarked on the Road to Recovery and Development
    Pan Hannian Reports at the People's Representatives Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th] Shanghai Vice Mayor Pan Hannian reported on the municipal work of August, September, and October at the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Representatives Conference on the 5th. Vice Mayor Pan pointed out that most of Shanghai's people's economic undertakings have embarked on the road to recovery and development. He said that since the First People's Representatives Conference in early August, the central task of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has shifted from takeover to crushing the imperialist and Kuomintang blockade of Shanghai. The Municipal People's Government implemented the six major tasks for building a new Shanghai adopted by the First People's Representatives Conference: supporting the front, evacuating the population, changing the production direction, developing rural work, encouraging the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and reorganizing and saving. The people of the city united and acted, overcoming the most difficult August and September, and finally enabling most of the people's economic undertakings to embark on the road to recovery and development.
    Vice Mayor Pan then detailed several specific tasks over the past three months:
    First, the reorganization and saving work. All agencies affiliated with the municipal government have undergone streamlining and transformation. The policy of unity, education, and transformation was adopted for the handling of old personnel, most of whom were placed and underwent centralized and rotating study, while a small number were mobilized to return to their hometowns for production or given severance pay. In early September, the measures for handling old employees were revised, adhering to Chairman Mao's principle of "three people's meals shared by five, and houses lived in with squeezing." Personnel who had been dismissed and had no means of support were recalled and placed, and temporary relief was provided to the elderly and weak. Second, civil administration, judicial affairs, and public security work. Centered on the struggle against the blockade, work was carried out to evacuate and relieve refugees, mediate civil disputes, and eliminate special agents and bandits, so as to reduce the burden on citizens and establish revolutionary order. According to the resolution of the First People's Representatives Conference, a committee for evacuating refugees and returning them to their hometowns for production was organized. In August, 400,000 refugees were evacuated, but later, due to floods, typhoons, and other reasons, 150,000 to 160,000 refugees flowed back to Shanghai in September and October. Therefore, the evacuation work was transformed into investigating reclamation areas and organizing refugees, preparing for a large-scale evacuation back to their hometowns for production next year. Regarding the mediation of disputes, the People's Court accepted more than 9,700 cases in eighty days after its establishment, of which civil cases accounted for 54% and criminal cases accounted for 46%. The method of handling was mainly mediation and supplemented by trial for civil cases, and mainly trial and supplemented by mediation for criminal cases. The focus of public security work was on eliminating special agents and bandits. A total of 145 cases were solved in three months, and 300 guns and a radio equipment were seized. Resolute suppression was carried out against armed special agents and bandits; general coerced accomplices were given lenient treatment. Thieves were released after education, and those who re-offended were concentrated for forced transformation. Third, financial economy and production recovery work. In terms of financial revenue and expenditure, due to tight spending and improved business, the city treasury's revenue reached an unprecedented balance. According to the cumulative data of five months, the revenue was 39.3 billion and the expenditure was 32.3 billion. The main source of financial revenue relies on taxation; under the principle of protecting industry and commerce, the number of taxes and levies has been reduced from dozens under the Kuomintang reactionary government to twelve, and the tax rate has been lowered and the tax threshold has been raised. The implementation adopts an automatic reporting and payment system, light taxation and heavy penalties, in order to improve the effect of tax revenue. Most of the expenditure is used for the salaries of public teachers and staff and operating expenses (such as building seawalls, streets, and public utility subsidies), which reflects the characteristics of the people's government's finances, taking from the people and using it for the people. In terms of industrial and commercial management, we assist legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises to overcome difficulties and resume production, and support the legitimate business of private industrial and commercial enterprises. Production loans have been granted, and finished products have been purchased 563 times. In addition, dozens of industry seminars have been held to listen to the opinions of the industrial and commercial sectors on taxation, wages, collective contracts, etc.; encourage the industrial and commercial sectors to solve difficulties by purchasing raw materials jointly, and promote the cooperation between public and private enterprises. In terms of mediating labor-management disputes, since the promulgation of the "Procedures for Handling Labor Disputes" and the "Interim Measures for Handling Resumption of Work Disputes," both labor and management have understood the specific steps for resolving disputes. At the same time, due to the improvement of the production situation, labor-management disputes have gradually decreased. At present, we are promoting labor and management to conclude collective contracts in various industries. Fourth, education and health work. Some schools and departments of similar nature have been merged and relocated. Democratic organizations and democratic leadership styles have been preliminarily established in public schools above the secondary level and some private schools. The tuition issue of private schools is jointly decided by the school, faculty, and students. Except for individual educational schools, the tuition fees are generally reduced by 20%. In addition, weekly study sessions for teachers and staff of large, medium, and small schools with more than 8,000 participants have been held, as well as seven night middle schools, one hundred and twelve workers' and peasants' night schools, and six hundred and fifteen literacy classes. The health work focuses on citizen epidemic prevention and public health. In August, 3.73 million people completed cholera prevention injections, and typhoid and diphtheria injections were carried out, water wells were disinfected, shantytowns were disinfected, 133,000 tons of garbage was removed, food was tested, and so on.
  　Future Central Work
    Finally, Vice Mayor Pan put forward the central work for the next three months, pointing out that the six major tasks adopted by the First People's Representatives Conference to crush the enemy's blockade and struggle for the construction of a new Shanghai are still the general guidelines for Shanghai's municipal work in the future. The specific work for the next three months is: (1) Continue to work hard to restore public and private production undertakings, especially in transportation, communications, electricity, and hardware. In the past, the recovery in these areas has not been extensive enough, and in the future, we must increase our efforts in these areas and accelerate recovery to meet objective needs. (2) Further improve the working class's enthusiasm for production, and quickly resolve factory safety, hygiene, and welfare measures; at the same time, strengthen trade union work, and more widely unite and educate workers. (3) Work hard to stabilize the market, continue to take effective measures, and ensure that the supply of Shanghai people's necessities, especially grain, coal, cloth, and oil, is sufficient to curb price increases. (4) Implement winter relief, and combine winter relief with the usual mobilization of refugees to return to their hometowns for production. (5) Strengthen winter prevention, rely on the assistance of the vast number of citizens, implement correct policies, and do a good job in winter prevention. (6) Carry out winter cleaning and sanitation work to avoid the occurrence of seasonal epidemics in the spring. (7) Appropriately improve the treatment of public teachers and staff and ensure the minimum living standards of public teachers and staff.

　　各界人民团结克服困难
  　上海大部分经济事业已走上恢复发展道路
    潘汉年在各界代表会上报告
    【新华社上海十六日电】上海市副市长潘汉年五日在上海市第二次各界人民代表会议上报告了八、九、十三个月的市政工作。潘副市长首先指出，目前上海大部分人民经济事业都已经走上了恢复和发展的道路。他说：自八月初第一次各界人民代表会议后，上海市人民政府的中心工作由接管转入粉碎帝国主义和国民党对上海的封锁，市人民政府执行了第一次各界人民代表会议所通过的支援前线、疏散人口、改变生产方针、开展农村工作、鼓励城乡物资交流，整编节约等建设新上海的六大任务。全市人民团结并行动起来，渡过了最困难的八、九月份，终于使大部分人民经济事业目前都走上了恢复和发展的道路。
    潘副市长接着详述三个月来的几项具体工作：
    第一、整编节约工作。市府所属各机构都进行了精简改造，对旧人员的处理，采取团结、教育和改造的方针，大部分作了安置，并进行了集中和轮流学习，小部分则分别动员其回乡生产或给资遣散。九月初又重订了旧员工处理办法，本着毛主席所指示的三个人的饭匀着五个人吃，房子挤着住的原则，将原先处理后生活无着的人员召回安置；对老弱进行了临时救济。第二、民政司法和治安工作。围绕着反对封锁斗争，进行了疏散和救济难民，调解民间纠纷，肃清特务匪徒等工作，以减轻市民负担和建立革命秩序。根据第一次各界代表会议决议，组织了疏散难民回乡生产委员会。八月份疏散难民四十万人，但后来因为水灾、风灾等原因，九、十月份难民倒流来沪的有十五、六万人，因此疏散工作转为调查垦区及组织难民，准备明年大量疏散回乡进行生产。关于调解纠纷，人民法院成立后，八十天内就受理案件九千七百多件，其中民事占百分之五十四，刑事占百分之四十六。处理方式，民事以调解为主，审判为辅，刑事以审判为主，调解为辅。治安工作中心则在肃清特务匪徒。三个月中共破案一百四十五件，缴获枪支三百支及无线电器材一部。对武装特务匪徒，实行坚决镇压；对一般胁从分子分别予以宽大处理。对偷窃犯则经过教育后释放，如再犯时则集中进行强迫改造。第三、财政经济和恢复生产工作。在财政收支方面，由于紧缩开支和商业好转，市库收入达到历来未有的平衡。据五个月累计，收入三百九十三亿，支出三百二十三亿。财政收入主要依靠税收；在保护工商业的原则下，捐税已由国民党反动政府的数十种减为十二种，同时减低生税率，提高起征点。在执行上采取自动报缴制，轻课重罚，以提高税收效果。支出绝大部分用于公教人员薪给和事业费（如修筑海塘、街道、公用事业贴补等），表现了取之于民、用之于民的人民政府财政的特点。工商管理方面，协助正当工商业克服困难和恢复生产，支持私营商工业的正当营业。曾贷放生产贷款，并收购成品五百六十三次。此外召开了数十种行业的座谈会，听取工商界对税务、工资、集体合同等方面的意见；推动工商界用联购原料等办法，解决困难，并促使公私企业相互配合。在调解劳资纠纷方面，自颁布了“劳资争议的处理程序”及“复业工纠纷处理暂行办法”之后，劳资双方了解了解决纠纷的具体步骤，同时由于生产状况好转，劳资纠纷已逐渐减少。目前正在推动各业劳资双方订立集体合同。第四、教育卫生工作。一部分同类性质的学校及院系实行了迁并。中等以上公立学校及部分私立学校已初步建立了民主组织和民主领导作风。私立学校学费问题，则由校方、教职员、学生三方面共同协商决定，除个别教育学校外，一般学费均减低了百分之二十。此外并举办了八千余人参加学习的大、中、小教职员星期学习会，举办了七所夜中学，一百一十二所工农夜校，六百一十五个识字班。卫生工作以市民防疫、公共卫生为主。八月份完成霍乱预防注射三百七十三万人，并进行了伤寒、白喉注射，消毒水井，消毒棚户，清除垃圾十三万三千吨，化验食品等等。
  　今后中心工作
    最后，潘副市长提出了今后三个月的中心工作，指出：第一届各界人民代表会议所通过的粉碎敌人封锁为建设新上海而斗争的六大任务，仍为今后上海市政工作的总方针。今后三个月的具体工作为：（一）继续努力恢复公私生产事业，特别是运输、交通、电力、五金方面过去恢复不够广泛，今后必须在这些方面增加力量，加速恢复，适应客观需要。（二）进一步提高工人阶级的生产热忱，迅速解决工厂安全、卫生、福利事业的措施；同时加强工会工作，更广泛地团结和教育工人。（三）努力稳定市场，继续采取有效办法，保证上海人民必需品，特别是粮、煤、布、油的供应充足，以制止物价暴涨。（四）实行冬令救济，同时将冬令救济与平时的动员难民回乡生产结合起来。（五）加强冬防，依靠广大市民的协助，执行正确的政策，把冬防工作做好。（六）举办冬季清洁卫生工作，以免春天发生流行性时疫。（七）适当改善公教人员的待遇，保障公教人员最低限度的生活。
