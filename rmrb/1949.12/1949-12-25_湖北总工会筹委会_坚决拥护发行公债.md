All local offices and municipal and county federations of trade unions should, in conjunction with current tasks, lead workers to study the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee and the letter to workers nationwide issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and conduct widespread publicity and education, so that everyone can understand the meaning of Chairman Mao's statement that we are "facing difficulties, have solutions, and have hope."

Save as much money as possible to subscribe to public bonds. And persuade and mobilize other classes, especially relatives and friends, to promote the purchase of public bonds.

    In state-owned enterprises, on the basis of democratization, require the formulation of production and savings plans, strive for production, increase output, improve quality, promote innovation, utilize waste materials, reduce costs, and increase national fiscal revenue.
    In private industrial and commercial enterprises, make appeals for production and savings on the basis of mutual benefit for labor and capital. The labor side should take the initiative to propose labor discipline and ensure the completion of production tasks. It is recommended that the capital side reduce unnecessary waste, break down concerns, and invest in production.

  　坚决拥护发行公债
    【本报讯】湖北省总工会筹委会于本月十九日给各级工会发出响应全国总工会号召，拥护中央人民政府发行人民胜利折实公债的指示。指示略称：一、各地办事处及市县总工会，应结合当前的任务，领导工人学习中央人民政府委员会的决议及全总发表的告全国工人书，并普遍进行宣传教育，使大家都能认识到毛主席所讲的我们是“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”的意义。
    二、在上述学习基础上，号召大家一致拥护中央人民政府发行公债的决议。尽可能的节省可以节省的钱认购公债。并向其他阶层，特别是向自己的亲友关系进行说服动员，推动大家购买公债。
    三、根据各种工人的业务性质，在工人已经发动组织的条件下，准备订出各生产单位以及个人的生产节约计划，真实从实际行动上表现出领导阶级在克服国家困难上的主人翁作用。
    在公营企业内，在民主化的基础上要求订出生产节约计划，努力生产，增加产量，提高质量，发扬创造，利用废料，减低成本，增加国家财政收入。
    在私营工商业在劳资两利基础上提出生产节约的号召，劳方主动的提出劳动纪律，保证完成生产任务。建议资方减少不必要的浪费，打破顾虑，投资生产。
