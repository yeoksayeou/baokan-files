　　Liulihe Cement Plant Workers
  　Actively Sign Up to Pre-order Public Bonds
  　Unanimously Support the Year-End Double Salary Handling Method
    [Our Newspaper's Report] All workers of the Liulihe Cement Plant are responding to the call of the Central People's Government to issue the People's Victory Discount Public Bonds. In addition to expressing their active support, they are now preparing to purchase them. More than 80 employees of the third shift of the big kiln workshop, led by veteran worker Wang Degui, have actively signed up to register for the purchase of public bonds. A total of more than 30 employees in Shifts B and C have now registered to buy more than 70 shares. After their voluntary registration, they discussed and said, "When the government starts selling next year, we will strive to buy first." Workers in Shift A are also brewing plans to ensure that each person strives to buy at least one share.
    [Another Report] In order to warmly welcome the first New Year after liberation and the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, all employees of the plant are stepping up production. While not hindering production, they are actively preparing entertainment programs, and promoting people from all walks of life to purchase Victory Discount Public Bonds through New Year's entertainment.
