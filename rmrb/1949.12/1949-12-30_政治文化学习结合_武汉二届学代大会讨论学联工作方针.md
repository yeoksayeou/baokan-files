　　Integrating Political and Cultural Learning
　　Wuhan Second Student Congress Discusses Student Union Work Guidelines
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 28th: The Second Wuhan Student Representative Congress was held from the 22nd to the 25th of December. Two hundred representatives attended, representing eighty units of universities, colleges, and vocational schools. Wu Defeng, the Mayor of Wuhan, Zhang Pinghua, the Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and others attended and spoke at the meeting. They unanimously called on the representatives to go back and promote the integration of political learning and cultural learning in schools throughout the city, overcoming the tendency to emphasize political activities and neglect cultural learning, or to discuss culture apart from politics. They all emphasized the need to inspire students' self-awareness and strengthen learning discipline. The meeting heard the Student Union's work summary on the implementation of the previous meeting's resolutions, as well as a typical report by Xiao Zhihe, a representative from the Hubei Provincial Medical College, on correcting deviations in student work at the school. Based on these reports, discussions were held in groups. Finally, the meeting elected candidates for the Second Student Union Executive Committee.
    Since the First Student Representative Congress, the Wuhan Student Union has achieved great success in leading student work: most students actively participated in social activities such as the anti-silver dollar campaign in the early days of Wuhan's liberation, the "July 1st" and "July 7th" propaganda campaigns, the "August 1st" army appreciation campaign, and the celebration of the founding of New China. Most schools have established student unions, formulated learning covenants, initially established correct learning perspectives, and some schools have even launched collective learning and democratic examinations. However, some shortcomings still exist in the work, the more common of which are emphasizing political thought and relaxing cultural learning, emphasizing extracurricular activities and relaxing in-class learning. This issue was hotly debated at this meeting, and it was finally unanimously agreed that student work should, from now on, implement New Democracy learning with regular classes as the center; integrate political learning and cultural learning, with extracurricular activities subordinate to in-class learning; the work of student unions and the Communist Youth League should coordinate with academic administration; establish good learning discipline; and pilot self-study mutual aid groups. The presidium of the congress suggested that the above opinions be handed over to the Second Executive Committee of the Student Representative Congress for collation and used as the guidelines for the Student Union's work in the future.

　　政治文化学习结合
　  武汉二届学代大会讨论学联工作方针
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】武汉市第二届学生代表大会已于二十二日至二十五日举行。出席代表二百人，代表大中专科学校八十个单位。武汉市市长吴德峰、中共武汉市委会副书记张平化等曾到会讲话。他们一致号召代表们回去推动全市学校，把政治学习与文化学习结合起来，克服强调政治活动忽视文化学习，或离开政治谈文化的偏向。他们都强调要启发学生的自觉性，加强学习纪律。会议听取了学联关于执行上次会议决议的工作总结，以及湖北省立医学院代表肖致和关于该校纠正学生工作中偏向的典型报告，并根据这些报告分组进行讨论。会议最后并选出第二届学联执行委员会人选。
    第一届学生代表大会以后，武汉市学联在领导学生工作方面，获得了很大成绩：一般学生都积极参加了武汉解放初期的拒用银元运动，“七一”“七七”宣传，“八一”劳军及庆祝新中国的诞生等社会活动，大部分学校均建立了学生会，订立了学习公约，初步树立了正确的学习观点，某些学校并发动集体学习与民主考试。但工作中仍存在着一些缺点，其中较普遍的是强调政治思想而放松了文化学习，强调了课外活动而放松了课内学习。这个问题在此次会议上展开了热烈讨论，最后一致认为学生工作今后应贯彻以正课为中心的新民主主义学习；政治学习与文化学习结合，课外活动服从于课内学习；学生会、青年团的工作要与学习行政配合；树立良好的学习纪律；试办自学互助小组。大会主席团建议将上述意见交学代会二届执委整理后，作为今后学联工作的方针。
