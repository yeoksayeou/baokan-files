  　Supports the Issuance of Victory Bonds
    [Beijing News] Beijing business and industrial figures have voiced their opinions in support of the Central People's Government's decision to issue People's Victory Indexed Bonds. Chuan Huating, Liu Yifeng, Sun Fuling, Pu Jiexiu, Ling Qijun, and others in charge of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, unanimously agreed that the issuance of bonds can reduce currency issuance, make up for a portion of the fiscal deficit, contract currency, stabilize prices, and further facilitate the development of legitimate industry and commerce. They said: Because of the victorious advance of the Liberation War, the government's burden has increased, and fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced. On the one hand, we cannot rely entirely on issuing currency, and on the other hand, we cannot further increase the people's burden. To prevent inflation, issuing bonds is the best fiscal approach during the transition period. Standing from the position of the business and industrial community, we unanimously support and agree with the issuance of bonds. The bonds issued by the reactionary ruling class in the past lacked credibility and harmed the people; now, the people's own government is issuing bonds to do its own work, and the people have absolute trust in it and will enthusiastically purchase them. Regarding the method of issuing bonds, Ling Qijun believes it is very correct and reasonable, and he cites four reasons: First, these are indexed bonds, and people buying bonds is equivalent to saving physical goods. At a certain period, the principal can be repaid with interest, and purchasing bonds is definitely not a loss. Second, it is calculated based on the wholesale prices of four physical goods: rice, flour, white cloth, and coal. This includes both industrial and agricultural products necessary for people's lives, which is more reasonable than calculating solely based on food grains. Third, it is calculated based on the average prices of six major cities, which is extremely convenient for people to redeem the principal. Bondholders can redeem the principal in various locations, without being affected by uneven prices in different regions. Fourth, the total issuance is 200 million shares. If calculated based on the current total wholesale price of the four commodities in Beijing, one share is approximately 12,000 yuan, then the total amount of bonds is approximately 2.4 trillion yuan. This amount is definitely not large, and it is issued in installments, which is achievable.

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！
　　北京工商界
  　拥护发行胜利公债
    【北京讯】京市工商业人士纷纷发表意见，拥护中央人民政府发行人民胜利折实公债的决定。市工商联合会筹备会负责人传华亭、刘一峰、孙孚凌、浦洁修、凌其峻等，一致认为发行公债可以减少发行通货，弥补一部分财政赤字，收缩通货，稳定物价，更有利于发展正当工商业。他们说：因为解放战争的胜利推进，以致政府负担加重，财政收支不能平衡。一方面不能完全依靠发行货币，一方面又不能再增加人民的负担。为了防止通货膨胀，发行公债是财政上在过渡时期的最好办法。我们站在工商界的立场，对发行公债是一致拥护与赞同的。过去反动统治阶级所发行的公债，是没有信用而损害人民的；现在人民自己的政府，发行公债办自己的事，而且人民对它有绝对的信任，一定踊跃认购。关于发行公债的办法，凌其峻认为非常正确合理，他举出四点理由：一、这是折实公债，人民买公债等于储蓄实物，到一定期限可以还本并有利息，认购公债绝不吃亏。二、是按大米、面粉、白细布、煤炭四种实物的批发价计算，其中包括了人民生活所必需的工业品与农业品两方面，比单按食粮一种农产品计算为合理。三、是按六大都市平均价计算，对于人民换本时极为方便，持有公债可到各地换本，不会受各地物价不平衡的影响。四、发行总数共二万万分，如以目前北京四种商品的批发价总和计算，一分约为一万二千元，则公债总数共合约二万四千亿元，这数目绝对不大，并且分期发行，这是可以办到的。
