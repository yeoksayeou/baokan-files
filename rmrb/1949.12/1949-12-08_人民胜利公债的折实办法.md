The issuance, repayment of principal, and payment of interest for this public bond are all calculated based on real goods. The unit is called "Fen," a term that is relatively unfamiliar in Guannei (areas south of the Shanhaiguan Pass), but is a well-known term in Northeast China. The public bonds issued in Northeast China are all calculated in "Fen," including items such as sorghum, Wufu cloth, salt, and raw coal, and are trusted and favored by general public bond subscribers.

The real goods that constitute a "Fen" include four types: rice (millet in Tianjin), flour, white fine cloth, and coal. These four items are basic necessities of life nationwide. When prices are unstable, the prices of these four items best represent the prices of general commodities. According to the experience of the two price jumps this year, it shows that these four items rise before other commodities, and the rate of increase is higher than that of general commodities. For example, in the July price surge, the East China region started with rice and coal, followed by other items; the North China region also started with rice and cloth, followed by other items. The second price surge that started in mid-October began with millet and cotton in North China, and with cloth in East China, followed by rice and flour, and then other items. Therefore, rice, flour, coal, and cloth have been proven to be the leading factors in general prices in previous price surges.

As for the quantity of each of the four items, it is determined based on the ratio of the general public's needs for each item and the contrast between the sales volume of these four items in the market at ordinary times. It is decided that six jin of rice (millet in Tianjin), one and a half jin of flour, four chi of white fine cloth, and sixteen jin of coal constitute the quantity and quality contained in one "Fen."

Furthermore, because the issuance of public bonds covers the whole country, and the prices in various parts of the country often vary, the price of one place cannot be used as the standard. Instead, six representative cities in China are selected: Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The sum of the average wholesale prices of the above-mentioned four items in the six major cities is used as the calculation standard for "Fen," and it is posted by the People's Bank of China every ten days.

Why use "Fen" instead of a real value price? Because: (1) The real value price changes daily, and small and medium-sized cities cannot know it on the same day, which causes difficulties in promotion and repayment of principal and interest. (2) The real value prices are different in different places. Rather than calculating the average real value price of the six major cities, it is more straightforward to calculate the sum of the average wholesale prices of the four items in the six major cities.

"Fen" is a unit of purchasing power. It represents a certain quantity of real goods when it starts to purchase public bonds, and it represents a certain quantity of real goods when it comes to repayment of principal and interest. This unit truly guarantees the interests of creditors and is more reliable than currency units or a certain real goods unit.

Today, it is undeniable that there is a large amount of idle capital in society. In order to maintain the certain value of their monetary capital, holders of idle capital will rush to buy materials when prices fluctuate, thus causing great damage to the market. This was the case in the past, and it has not changed now. But the difference is that the People's Government has a considerable amount of materials in hand and has a certain regulatory power in the market. The result of general speculators starting from the point of preserving capital and making money will inevitably end in losses (with only a few exceptions). Taking this price surge as an example: the rise was fierce when it came, and the fall was also rapid when it went. The highest price of 20-count yarn in Shanghai (this is the main object of speculation) reached more than 3.7 million per piece, but it has now fallen to 2.7-2.8 million. In the midst of rapid rises and falls, general speculators may suffer heavy losses. Therefore, commodity speculation in the future will not only risk reputation, status, and even personal freedom, but also risk the great danger of losing one's capital. In the past, bureaucratic capital was in league with speculators, so speculation was bound to be profitable; but today's national economy is at odds with speculators, and speculation will inevitably lead to loss of both fame and fortune!

Investing in real value public bonds is a new path for idle capital. It not only guarantees reliable principal and interest for public bond buyers, but also transforms socially destructive speculative funds into productive funds that are constructive to the national economy.

In addition, public bonds are also a reliable means of savings. They are not only safer than gold, silver, and foreign currencies, but also guarantee a 5% real interest rate. Before our currency is stable, short-term savings in large cities can take the form of real value deposits, but longer-term savings in general areas can now be invested in public bonds.

To this end, we must:

(1) Increase fiscal revenue, reduce expenditures, and gradually strive for a balance of payments. In terms of revenue, the old liberated areas should further strengthen tax collection work, and the newly liberated cities and rural areas should quickly establish tax collection agencies, rectify the tax system, and rationally adjust the burden of cities and rural areas in order to expand and increase national income. In terms of expenditure, we must reduce it as much as possible, and all expenses that can be saved should be saved. Various undertakings should also be carried out according to priorities and urgency. All production and enterprise departments should establish a strict economic accounting system and oppose waste. The bad practices of some departments in the past that only asked for money for budgets but did not make profit and loss settlement reports must be quickly overcome. Only in this way can we guarantee the successful completion of the 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget.

(2) Issue public bonds and tighten currency. Under today's national financial situation, relying solely on rectifying existing taxes and streamlining savings cannot completely balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. Therefore, on the 2nd of this month, the fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the historically significant decision to "issue People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds" to reduce the government's financial burden. Under the current national economic difficulties, it is also a burden for the people to buy public bonds, but this burden, as Vice Premier Chen Yun said: "is better than the loss caused by the increase in banknotes and the depreciation of currency. Because the result of the depreciation of currency is that the value of the depreciated part is completely lost. Buying public bonds is a burden at the moment, but after all, it can repay the principal and interest, and it is not a loss...". We hope that people of all strata across the country will actively respond to the government's call, enthusiastically subscribe to public bonds, and help the government overcome the current financial difficulties.

(3) According to Vice Premier Chen Yun's report: "Even if public bonds are issued and the fiscal deficit is reduced next year, the fiscal situation next year will still be difficult." Therefore, in order to avoid price fluctuations, on the one hand, our state-owned trade agencies must also combine with cooperatives in local markets, unite legitimate private businesses, carry out planned regulation of supply and demand, organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and at the same time strengthen market management and severely crack down on speculative activities in order to effectively stabilize prices. On the other hand, with our military victory, it is necessary to quickly eliminate the market activities of pseudo "silver dollar coupons," foreign currencies, and silver dollars in the newly liberated areas and expand the circulation of RMB. At present, most of Guangdong Province is still a Hong Kong dollar market, and in the vast rural areas of many provinces in Jiangnan, some people still use silver dollars as a medium of exchange. If we can quickly eliminate foreign currencies and silver dollars in these areas, the demand for RMB circulation will greatly increase. Experience has shown that when the scope of our currency circulation expands and the currency value stabilizes, the circulation speed of the currency will also decrease accordingly. Under this circumstance, even if our currency issuance increases a bit, it will not cause price fluctuations. On the contrary, if we cannot maintain price stability, the circulation speed of the currency will accelerate, and the scope of circulation will also shrink accordingly. The result of this cycle will inevitably be to promote greater price fluctuations. Therefore, after our government issues public bonds and tightens currency, our trade and financial institutions should still strive to strengthen the regulation of market supply and demand, expand the scope of RMB circulation, and improve and consolidate the credibility of RMB in order to ensure that prices will not fluctuate drastically next year.

Based on the above, we can see that we still have considerable difficulties in our current financial and economic work; but we have ways to overcome these difficulties. As long as we do our work well, we can predict that the price situation next year will definitely be much better than this year.

　　人民胜利公债的折实办法
    狄超白
    这次公债的募集及还本付息，都是以实物为计算标准。其单位名之曰“分”，这一单位名称在关内较为陌生，但在东北已是很熟悉的名词了。东北所发的公债都是以“分”为计算单位，包括物品为高梁、五福布、盐、原煤四种。为一般认购公债者所信任爱好。
    构成“分”的实物品种计有四种，即大米（天津为小米）、面粉、白细布及煤炭。这四种物品是全国范围内的基本的生活必需品，在物价不稳定的情况下，这四种物品的价格最足以代表一般商品的价格。根据本年两次物价跳跃的经验，都说明这四种物品既涨在其他商品之先，上涨率又复较一般商品为高。例如七月涨风，华东区是以大米煤炭开始，其他各物随后；华北区亦以大米纱布开始，其他各物随后。十月中开始的第二次涨风，在华北以小米棉花开始，在华东则以纱布开始，大米面粉继之，其他各物随后，所以米面煤布四种物品在历次涨风中已证明为一般物价的领导因素。
    至于四种物品的计算分量的多寡，是根据一般人民对各物需要的比率，并根据平时市场这四种物品的销售数量的对比，而决定以大米六斤（天津为小米），面粉一斤半，白细布四尺，煤炭十六斤，构成一个“分”所包含的质与量。
    更因为公债的发行遍及全国，而全国各地的物价往往有差异，所以不能以一地的价格为标准，乃选择国内有代表性的六大城市上海、天津、汉口、西安、广州、重庆，将上述六大城市各该物品的平均批发价格底总和，作为“分”的计算标准，每十日由中国人民银行挂牌一次。
    为什么不用折实牌价而用“分”呢？因为：（一）折实牌价逐日更换，中小城市无法当日得知，推销时和还村付息时都有困难。（二）折实牌价各地不同，与其以六大城市的折实牌价平均计算，不如即以六大城市四种物品的平均批发价格底总和计算，较为直截了当。
    “分”是一种购买力的单位，它开始购买公债时代表着一定数量的实物，还本付息时间等地代表着一定数量的实物。这个单位确实保证了债权人的利益，比之货币单位或某一种实物单位都要确实可靠些。
    今天不可否认地，社会里有大量的游资存在着，游资的持有人为了要保持其货币资本底一定的价值，在物价波动时就要抢购物资，因此对市场发生极大的破坏作用。这在过去是如此，现在也仍未改变。但所不同的，是人民政府掌握着相当数量的物资，在市场上已具有一定的调节力量，一般投机家以保本赚钱出发，结果必以亏蚀告终（只有少数例外）。以此次涨风为例：来时涨势固猛，去时跌势亦烈。上海二十支纱（这是投机的主要对象）最高时会达每件三百七十余万，现已跌至二百七八十万，在猛涨猛跌之中，一般投机家可能亏蚀甚大。所以今后的商品投机，不仅仅要冒名誉地位以至个人自由权利的危险，而且要冒亏蚀老本的极大危险，过去是官僚资本与投机家为伍，所以投机一定获利；而今天的国家经济却与投机家为敌，投机必至名利两失！
    投向折实公债是游资新生的道路。它既保证公债购买人可靠的本息，并使社会具有破坏性的投机资金转而为对国民经济有建设性的生产资金。
    除此而外，公债也是可靠的储蓄手段，它既较金银外币稳当，同时又保证取得五厘的实物利息，在我们通货还没有稳定之先，大城市的短期储蓄可以采取折实存的方式，但一般地区的比较长期的储蓄，现在可以投向公债。
    为此我们必须：
    （一）增加财政收入，减少支出，逐渐争取收支平衡。在收入方面，老解放区应进一步加强税收工作，新解放的城市及农村，则应迅速建立税收机关，整顿税收制度，合理的调整城市与农村的负担，以期扩大增加国家收入。在支出方面，又须尽量减少，一切可以节省的开支皆应节省之，举办各种事业，亦应分别轻重缓急进行。各个生产企业部门，应建立严格的经济核算制度，反对浪费，过去有些部门那种只有要钱预算，而不做盈亏结算报告的不良作风，必须迅速克服。只有如此，才可能保证胜利完成一九五○年度全国财政收支概算。
    （二）发行公债，紧缩通货。在今天的国家财政状况下，如单靠整顿现有税收，精简节约等办法，尚不能使财政收支完全平衡。因此本月二日中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上，通过了有历史意义的“发行人民胜利折实公债”的决定，借以减轻政府的财政负担。在今天全国经济困难的情况下，人民购买公债也是一种负担，但这种负担，正如陈云副总理所说：“比起因增发钞票，币值下跌的损失说来，是比较好的。因为币值下跌的结果，其下跌部分的币值，是全部损失了的，购买公债在一时算来是负担，但是究竟可以还本付息，不是一种损失……”。我们希望全国各阶层人民，积极响应政府号召，踊跃认购公是债，协助政府渡过当前的财政困难。
    （三）根据陈云副总理的报告：“即使发行了公债，缩小了明年财政赤字之后，明年的财政情况，仍是困难的。”因此为避免物价波动，一方面我国营贸易机关还必须在各地市场上结合合作社，团结正当的私营商业，进行有计划的调剂供求，组织城乡物资交流，同时加强市场管理，严厉取缔投机活动，借以有效的稳定物价。另方面，随着我军事上的胜利，在新解放区要迅速肃清伪“银元券”，外币及银元的市场活动，扩大人民币的流通范围。目前广东省大部仍为港币市场，江南很多省份的广大农村，至今仍有人以银元为交换媒介。如我们能很快将这些地区的外币、银元肃清，则人民币的流通需要量，将会大大增加。经验证明当我货币流通范围扩大了，币值稳定了，则货币的流通速度亦将随之减低。在这种情况下，即使我货币发行量增加一些，亦不会引起物价波动。相反如不能保持物价稳定，则货币的流通速度将会加快，流通范围亦即随之缩小，这样循环的结果，必然是促成物价更加波动。因之当我政府发行公债，紧缩通货以后，我贸易金融机关在稳定物价工作上，仍应努力加强市场的供求调剂，扩大人民币的流通范围，提高巩固人民币的信用，以保证明年的物价不再发生剧烈波动。
    根据以上所述，可以看到我们目前在财经工作上尚有相当大的困难；但我们有办法来克服这些困难，只要我们的工作作好，我们可以预计明年的物价情况，一定会比今年好得多。
