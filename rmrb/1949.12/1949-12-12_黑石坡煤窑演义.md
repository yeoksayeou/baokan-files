  　Forty-Six: The Bottom of the Mine
    Only now did Old Yin truly pay attention to the mine. He and Shuan Cheng took the mine opening plan that Old Bai had made in the past and went to find Da San happily. He knew Da San had a bit of a contrary streak and was still somewhat dissatisfied with him, but he didn't dwell on it. He even called him "Da San" for the first time and said, "In the past, I really didn't value this mine and delayed things; but I just didn't know the ropes, I haven't even seen whether the bottom of the mine is square or round. Anyway, let's learn! Let's go, Da San, let's go down to the mine and take a look." Da San's mood became calmer after hearing these words, and Shuan Cheng said, "Old Yin keeps asking me about your plans, but I'm just a dabbler. Let's go and learn too." So Da San put on his old top hat, and followed the two of them.
    They first went down to the small west entrance mine. Da San was in front, Shuan Cheng was behind, each with an oil lamp, taking care of Old Yin. The miners inside and outside the mine, seeing Old Yin going down, greeted him with smiles. One told him to take off the white towel he was wearing around his neck to avoid getting it dirty, and another handed him a torn burlap sack to put on his head to block the water. As they went down, Da San told Old Yin about various things, and Old Yin asked a lot of questions. Da San explained everything in detail, such as the black and yellow things in the middle of the coal wall called "copper," which couldn't be burned, but could only be used to boil black alum; the white soil in the middle of the coal wall was "Qian," which could burn sand; as for the stones, coal was transformed from ancient trees, but stones couldn't be transformed, so they were still there... Old Yin asked about all these things clearly. Old Yin also asked Da San how he identified directions, how could it be clearly east, but actually north? Da San said, "This only depends on seeing more and experiencing more with your own eyes, there's no other way." Shuan Cheng laughed and said, "Isn't that the same as you recognizing words, Old Yin! For example, I don't recognize many words, Da San Uncle's 'Yuan' character in Zhang Yuanlu's name, I always confuse it with the 'Yun' character, or the 'Dao' character, that's really strange!" At this time, they inspected the air shaft that Yu Bao hadn't fully dug through in the past, and then turned into a large fork in the road. They saw Tian Lu lying inside, mining a large piece of coal weighing over a hundred catties. Old Yin laughed "hehe"; Niu Bao next to him quickly said, "Don't laugh, Old Yin, watch me!" But what Niu Bao mined was only half the size of Tian Lu's. People laughed! Niu Bao got up and wiped his sweat, saying, "Damn it, it won't work! I've been learning from Tian Lu every day, but it's no use!" Shuan Cheng laughed and said, "If you want to catch up with him, you'll probably have to wait ten years!" Tian Lu said, "He's really been working hard lately, doing a good job." Niu Bao quickly flattered Shuan Cheng, "Don't underestimate me, big director! You ask Tian Lu, I've really been using all my strength these days." Tai Cheng also came over to praise Niu Bao for learning well, but Da San turned his head and walked out of the mine; Tai Cheng ignored Da San and kept pestering Old Yin, sending him all the way out of the mine.
    They then went down to the east mine. It was seven or eight zhang deep to the water here, so Old Yin took out the plan, listened to Da San explaining it in detail, and calculated the accounts with Shuan Cheng. Old Yin was happy to hear that all the calculations were so meticulous, and he said casually, "It's actually so scientific!" Then he asked, "How many days will it take for this air shaft?" Seeing that Old Yin was happy, Da San said directly, "You're not familiar with this business! We're risking our lives to do it anyway, but the air shaft business isn't something you can see immediately, who can say for sure? Who can say for sure what's inside the coal?" Old Yin said again, "But you have to be sure of a certain percentage!" "I won't lie to you, and I won't boast, but I'm confident about seventy percent." Old Yin was even happier, and he calculated how many people could be hired, how much coal could be produced, and how much money could be made. As he calculated, his mind was racing. He couldn't help but think that he had heard that a mine in Yangquan, because the military situation was unstable when it was first liberated, and the leaders didn't recognize the importance of industry and mining, didn't decide to immediately save water and produce coal, and didn't even approve sending someone to the mine to pump water and take care of it. As a result, when they started to fix it half a year later, it cost one to two hundred dan of millet just to pump the water! Old Yin also remembered what Chairman Mao had said about the future of China's industrialization, and everything he had been discussing with Old Bai. He had studied science in middle school! But these ten years of rural work had made his vision so narrow that he couldn't even recognize a little rural indigenous industry, and he was so afraid of a kiln that cost three to four thousand catties of grain! As he walked outside the mine, he lowered his head and said, "Da San, work hard! Shuan Cheng, hold a good discussion tonight to help everyone. As long as everyone in the village is willing to build this kiln, and agrees to put out the silver dollars, we'll start work immediately!" After speaking, they each went to eat. At night, Old Yin didn't attend the meeting, but spent the night discussing the affairs of earth kilns and large machine mines with Da San, and he was extremely happy.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５０）
    康濯
  　四十六　窑底
    直到现在，老尹才真正注意到窑。他和拴成拿上了过去老白作的开窑计划，高高兴兴地寻大三去。他知道大三那股蹩扭劲，对他还有些不满意，但他没结记这些，他还头一回称呼人家叫“大三”，并说：“过去我着实是没看重这窑，耽误了大事；可我也就是不摸门，连窑底是方是圆也没见过。咱反正学习吧！走，大三，咱们下窑看看去。”大三听了这阵话，心气不觉平和了些，拴成又说：“老尹拿着你们那底底光问我，我也是半瓶醋。走，咱也学学去。”大三就戴上破礼帽，和二人相跟着走了。
    他们先下西口小窑，大三在前，拴成在后，一人点着个油扁，前后照应着老尹；窑里窑外的窑黑们，见老尹下窑，也都喜笑着和他说话，并且这个叫他解下＠子上围的白毛巾，免得闹脏了，那个又递给他一条破麻口袋，披在头上挡水。他们往下下着，大三边走边告老尹各样事物，老尹也问得挺多，大三也说得挺细致，象那煤墙中间一块块黑黄的物件叫“铜”，不能烧，只能熬黑矾；煤墙中间的白土是“乾”，能烧砂货，石头嘛，炭是古年代树木变的，石头变不了，所以还在那……连这些老尹也问得挺清楚。老尹又问大三是怎么识别方向的，怎么明明象是东，倒却是北？大三道：“这只有靠肉眼见得多经得广，别也没道理。”拴成笑道：“这还不跟你们认字一样么，老尹！好比我识字不多，大三叔那张远禄的‘远’字，我老是跟；‘运’字‘道’字分不清，这可稀罕哩！”这时他们察看了过去玉宝没刨透的风筒，接着又转过一条大岔道，只见刨炭的人里边，天禄正躺着刨下块百十斤往上的大炭，老尹看得“呵呵”笑起来；旁边牛宝忙道：“老尹别笑，看我这！”但牛宝刨下来的，却不过天禄那一半大小，人们笑了！牛宝爬起来擦擦汗道：“＠他妈不行！咱见天跟天禄爷学的，就是不顶！”拴成笑道：“你要赶上人家，怕还得十年！”天禄道：“他这阵子倒就是卖劲，干得不赖。”牛宝忙巴结拴成道：“你个大主任可不敢小看我呀！你问天禄爷，这些时我着实是他妈吃奶的劲也使出来了。”泰成也过来夸说牛宝就是学好了，大三却扭回头就往窑外走；这边泰成没理大三，但还缠着老尹说这说那地，直把他送出窑外。
    他们又下东窑。这里下去七八丈就是水，老尹就掏出了那张计划，听大三细说着，并和拴成算着帐；老尹听着这一切计算都那么周密，不禁高兴起来，自己随口说道：“还闹得这么科学哩！”接着他又问：“你这透风筒得多少日子？”大三见老尹高兴，也就直说道：“你这话不在行道！咱们反正破着命干，可透风筒的营生不是肉跟看着的，那谁敢说准定？谁能说准炭里头有什么物件？”老尹又道：“可你总得拿住几成子底底吧！”“这我不瞒着，也不夸口，反正七成是拿稳了的。”老尹更高兴了，就又计算着往后能下多少人、出多少炭、赚多少钱，他一边算，一边心眼活跳活跳地，不禁想起他听说阳泉有个矿，刚解放时因为军事形势不稳定，加上领导没认识工矿的重要，没决心立时打存水出炭，连矿上安一个人打打水照管照管也没批准，结果半年后再拾掇，光打水就花了小米一二百石的！老尹又想起毛主席说过的中国工业化的前途，和平日跟老白捣拉的一切；自己还是念过中学学过科学的哩！这十年农村工作，却闹得眼光这么狭小，连农村的一点土法工业也认不清，三四千斤粮食闹个窑还那么着怕！当他在窑外走的时候，他低下头来说：“大三，使劲干！拴成，今黑家好好帮大伙讨论讨论，只要浑村大伙都乐意闹这窑，都同意拿出现洋来，咱们立时就动工！”说完，他们各自吃饭去了。到黑夜，老尹也没有参加会去，又找大三捣拉了一夜土窑和机器大矿的事，心中高兴的不行。
