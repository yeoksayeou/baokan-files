[Northeast News] The Songjiang Provincial People's Government Livestock Epidemic Prevention Institute and 53 comrades from the livestock production departments of various counties went to the bovine plague areas of 12 counties including Bayan, Mulan, and Tonghe on October 1st. Using newly researched rabbit-adapted bovine serum bovine plague vaccine and other methods, they carried out autumn bovine plague preventive injections. By November 7th, they completed the task as scheduled, immunizing more than 81,000 head of cattle, protecting and enhancing the animal power for this winter's forestry logging and next year's agricultural production. The reasons for the successful completion of this prevention work are: First, the counties and districts attached great importance to it and actively cooperated in carrying it out. For example, the deputy county head of Jixi County personally assisted the livestock production comrades in planning and holding meetings; the district heads of Mishan County personally helped with disinfection and maintaining order. Second, the publicity and mobilization work was done more thoroughly, basically dispelling the ideological concerns of farmers about delaying work. They rushed to bring their cattle for injections. Third, the livestock production staff were proactive and responsible, and launched competitions with each other to ensure that the task was completed on schedule. Due to the use of rabbit-adapted bovine plague vaccine, each injection saved 8,600 yuan compared to using ordinary vaccine, totaling a saving of over 600 million yuan for the injection of 81,000 head.

  　八万耕牛免疫
  　各地应及早注意保护牲畜
    【东北讯】松江省人民政府家畜防疫所及各县畜产工作同志五十三人，从十月一日分赴巴彦、木兰、通河等十二个县牛瘟区，用新研究成功的兔化牛血牛瘟疫苗等方法，施行秋季牛瘟预防注射，至十一月七日按期完成任务，使八万一千余头耕牛免疫，给今年冬季林业采伐及明年农业生产保护和增强了畜力。此预防工作顺利完成的原因：第一、各县区重视、有力的配合进行，如鸡西县副县长亲身协助畜产工作同志计划、开会等；密山县各区区长亲身帮助消毒和维持秩序。其次，宣传动员工作做的较彻底，基本打通了农民怕耽误工作等思想顾虑。争前恐后赶牛注射。第三、是畜产工作人员积极负责，互相展开竞赛，保证了按期完成任务。由于使用兔化牛瘟牛疫苗，每注射一头较用普通疫苗节省八千六百元，总计注射八万一千头节省六亿余元。
