Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th: TASS, Moscow - The newspaper *Izvestia* recently published an article by Kudryavtsev discussing the role of Japan in the plans of U.S. imperialism.

The author writes: Due to the bankruptcy of atomic diplomacy, the most arrogant representatives of U.S. imperialism have begun to seek large numbers of mercenaries. They first looked at West Germany and Japan, which is currently occupied by U.S. forces. American militarists do not conceal their dreams of turning Japan into cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism. The Japanese army has been revived under the guise of the police, and its numbers are increasing daily. The police are being supplied with heavy weapons, including machine guns. Currently, police in many prefectures are conducting large-scale military exercises. In the first half of November, such exercises were organized in Nagano, Fukuoka, Saga, and Osaka prefectures. In Nagano Prefecture, the police exercises included mock attacks on railway stations and river-crossing exercises at night. All of this is fully approved by the American occupation authorities and carried out according to their plans.

In implementing their plan to turn Japan into a bridgehead and cannon fodder, U.S. imperialists are primarily opposing the democratic movement of the Japanese people, which grew after the defeat of Japanese militarists. Progressive elements of the Japanese people believe that the defeat of Japanese militarism is an opportunity for the country to develop further along a path of peace and democracy. Therefore, it is no accident that the Japanese reactionaries and the American occupation authorities, while intensifying preparations for a new war, are also launching attacks on democratic organizations, which have recently been using police terror tactics without disguise.

In doing so, the Japanese reactionaries are primarily targeting the Communist Party. Currently, the police terror is causing the Japanese working people to recall the darkest days of Japan under the rule of the militarist clique.

The growing movement in Japan to strive for peace (which is particularly evident in the convening of the Japan Peace Congress) shows that the Japanese people are increasingly aware of the gambling nature of the U.S. military and political plans for Japan.

The U.S. imperialists' gambling plan to achieve world hegemony is destined to politically enslave the Japanese people and bring economic disaster to Japan. A representative example of this is the U.S. foreign trade policy towards Japan. Foreign trade accounted for a very large part of Japan's pre-war economy, because Japan did not have the necessary resources to supply its industrial raw materials. Industries producing export goods accounted for a large proportion of Japanese industry. China was the main market for Japanese imports and exports, with China and the then-Kwantung Province accounting for no less than 30% of Japan's total foreign trade. However, the American occupation authorities do not allow Japan to conduct normal trade with China, that is, not to trade with the main market for Japanese goods, which has seriously affected the Japanese economy. They seek to artificially isolate Japan from the Asian continent and turn it into an American bulwark on the east coast of Asia, with the United States itself wanting to use Japan as a market for goods that cannot find customers in the United States. The United States does not intend to open its own market to Japanese goods, and if it does import any goods from Japan, it is mainly raw silk, because silk is a luxury item. In this regard, a telling example is that MacArthur, in his recent abolition of the minimum price for Japanese exports, exclusively excluded raw silk; the minimum price system was implemented by MacArthur's headquarters after the war. With this measure, the U.S. authorities have strengthened the competitiveness of Japanese goods in all markets outside the United States. Needless to say, the British authorities are taking appropriate measures to resist the dumping of Japanese goods. As a result, under the conditions that the United States and other capitalist countries are advancing towards an economic crisis, the first to be affected will be the currently devastated Japanese economy. Therefore, in the economic field as well, U.S. imperialists are attempting to sacrifice the Japanese people to implement their gambling policies in the Far East.

The imperialist nature of the U.S. policy towards Japan is obvious. American expansionists are trying to use Japan as a bridgehead and the Japanese people as cannon fodder in their military adventures in the Far East. However, in doing so, they overestimate their strength and clearly underestimate the strength of the national liberation movement of the Asian people, which has greatly strengthened and is inextricably linked with the democratic movement of the Japanese people.

　　美帝想把日本人民当炮灰
    它武装警察、反对民主运动、破坏日本经济，这样做，显然过低估计了亚洲人民民族解放运动的力量。
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷发表库得里雅夫捷夫的论文，论日本在美帝国主义的计划中所起的作用。
    作者写道：由于原子外交的破产，美帝国主义最为狂妄的代表，已在开始寻找大批雇庸军。他们最先看到的是西德和现在为美军占领的日本。美国军国主义者毫不掩盖他们的梦想，即将日本变成美帝国主义的炮灰。日本军队已在警察的伪装下复活，它的数量日益增加。警察被供给重武器，其中有机关枪。现在，许多县份的警察都在进行大规模的军事演习。在十一月的上半月，长野、福冈、佐贺和大阪等县，都布置了这种演习。警察在长野县的演习是佯攻火车站，于夜中作渡河演习等。所有这一切，都是完全得到美国占领当局的批准和按照他们的计划进行的。
    美帝国主义者在实施他们将日本变成桥头堡垒和炮灰的计划中，首先反对日本人民的民主运动，这一运动是在日本军国主义者战败之后生长起来的。日本人民的进步分子认为，日本军国主义的战败，是国家沿着和平与民主的道路进一步发展的机会。因此，与加紧新战争准备同时，日本反动派和美国占领当局又对民主组织发动进攻，这决不是偶然的，这种进攻近来已经不加掩饰地使用警察的恐怖手段了。
    日本反动派在这样做的时候，主要的打击对象是共产党。目前，警察的恐怖使日本劳动人民回忆起日本在军国主义集团统治下的最黑暗的日子。
    日本日益增长的争取和平的运动（这特别表现在日本拥护和平大会的召开上）表明：日本人民愈来愈认识到美国对日军事政治计划的赌博性质。
    美帝国主义者取得世界霸权的赌博计划，注定了要使日本人民在政治上沦为奴隶，使日本在经济上遭到灾难。在这方面，很能代表的一个例子，是美国对日本的国外贸易政策。对外贸易在日本战前经济中占非常大的部分，因为日本没有供应它的工业原料的必需资源。生产出口货的各业，在日本工业中占很大的地位。中国就是日本进出口的主要市场，中国和当时的关东省在日本全部对外贸易中所占的百分比，不下于百分之三十。但是，美国占领当局不准许日本与中国进行正常的贸易，也就是不准与日本货的主要市场贸易，这就严重地影响了日本的经济。　他们力求人为地使日本与亚洲大陆隔绝，并将它变为美国在亚洲东海岸的壁垒，美国自己要想把日本当作销售在美国找不到顾客的货品的市场。美国并不打算打开自己的市场让日货进来，如果说它也从日本输入任何货物的话，那主要的都是天然丝，因为丝是奢侈品。在这方面，很可以说明问题的一件事情是：麦克阿瑟在最近废除日本出口货最低价格时，独将天然丝除外；最低价格制是在战后麦克阿瑟总部实行的。美国当局凭借这种措施，增强了日本货在美国以外的一切市场中竞争的能力。不用说，英国当局正在采取适当的抵制日货倾销的措施。其结果，在美国和其他资本主义国家正在向着经济危机前进之下，首先受其影响的将是目前业已破坏了的日本经济。因此，美帝国主义者在经济方面也同样地企图在远东牺牲日本人民来执行他们的赌博政策。
    美国对日政策的帝国主义性质是显而易见的。美国的扩张主义者力图在他们远东的军事冒险中，将日本作为桥头堡垒，将日本人民作为炮灰。但是，他们在这样做的时候，过高估计了他们的力量，并且显然过低估计了亚洲人民民族解放运动的力量，这个运动已大为壮大，并且是与日本人民的民主运动不可分割地结合在一起的。
