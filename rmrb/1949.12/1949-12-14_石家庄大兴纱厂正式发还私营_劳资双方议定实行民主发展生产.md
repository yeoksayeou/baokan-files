Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th Dispatch: The privately-owned Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory, which has been under the management of the People's Government for the past two years, was officially returned to Hankou Daxing Textile Co., Ltd. on November 9th. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang two years ago, the factory's负责人 fled, and production came to a standstill. In order to restore production and protect the livelihoods of the workers, the People's Government temporarily took over the factory. This year, in April, the parties concerned requested to return to self-management. After the government verified that it was indeed private capital and consulted with the representatives of the capital for many times, it was agreed to hand over on September 1st. Later, because the capital failed to raise the funds垫垫 by the government during the period of trusteeship, it requested an extension of two months, which was delayed until last month for formal return. In the agreement contract signed on November 1st, it was stipulated that the original power unit of the Daxing Yarn Factory (the Second Power Plant of the state-owned Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company after the takeover) would also be returned at the same time. At the beginning of the People's Government's takeover, the factory was bombed by bandits, and the machinery and factory buildings and warehouses were almost completely destroyed. In the past two years, thanks to the joint efforts of the government and all the factory's employees, the factory has not only restored its former appearance, but also the quality of its products has surpassed the level before liberation. After the government took over the factory, it established a good democratic management system in the factory, and there were more facilities and guarantees for the welfare of the workers, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the workers for production. When the government decided to return the factory in August this year, the workers of the factory were afraid of being oppressed by the capitalists again, and they were afraid that production would be affected after the return. There were great concerns in their minds. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted education in the branch of the Daxing Yarn Factory, and explained the significance of the return in the mass organizations such as the trade union and the Communist Youth League. In order to ensure that labor and management can work together to develop production after the return, the factory's trade union and Daxing Company jointly signed a labor-management agreement, stipulating that the company guarantees the implementation of the past various democratic systems, and the trade union continues to carry out labor discipline education among workers to ensure the completion of production tasks.

　　石家庄大兴纱厂正式发还私营
  　劳资双方议定实行民主发展生产
    【新华社北京十三电】两年来由人民政府代管的私营石家庄大兴纱厂，已于十一月九日正式发还给汉口大兴纺织股份有限公司。前年石家庄解放后，该厂负责人逃匿，生产陷于停顿，人民政府为了恢复生产，保障职工生活，乃将该厂暂行接管。今年四月，该厂当事人请求发还自营，经政府查明确属私人资本，与资方代表多次磋商后，议定于九月一日移交，后因资方未能筹付政府在代管期内所抵垫之资金，要求展期两个月，以此延至上月始行正式发还。在十一月一日签订的协议合同中，规定原大兴纱厂之原动部（接管后为公营石家庄电灯公司第二发电厂）亦同时发还。在人民政府接管之初，该厂遭匪机轰炸，机器与厂房、仓库几已全毁。两年以来由于政府与全厂职工的共同努力，工厂不仅已恢复旧观，而且产品的质量超过解放前的水准。政府接管该厂后，在厂内建立了良好的民主管理制度，对职工福利也有了更多的设施和保证，因而大大发扬了职工的生产积极性。在今年八月政府决定发还时，该厂职工由于害怕再受资方压迫，害怕发还后生产受影响，在思想上存在着很大的顾虑。中国共产党石家庄市委员会为此曾在大兴纱厂的支部中进行教育，并在工会、青年团等群众组织中分别解释发还的意义。为了保证发还以后劳资双方能共同努力发展生产，该厂工会与大兴公司方面共同签订了劳资议定书，规定公司方面保证实行过去的各种民主制度，工会则继续在工人中进行劳动纪律教育，以保证生产任务的完成。
