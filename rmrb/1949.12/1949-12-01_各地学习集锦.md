　　Learning Compendium from Various Regions

　　In Shenyang, learning groups are organized according to the theoretical and cultural level of the cadres. Regarding the issue of group organization, Song Li, the head of the Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department, explained to the heads of various units as follows: because this is not a matter of political treatment, those who can study theory should study theory, and those who cannot study theory should study culture. Studying culture is to prepare for studying theory.
　　The General Study Committee of the Pingyuan Province directly under the central government stipulates that learning groups should generally be divided based on the level of political theory, while taking into account the cultural level and the specific circumstances of each unit. Generally speaking, those at the prefectural and county levels with strong learning abilities are classified as Group A, those at the county and district levels with strong learning abilities are classified as Group B, and responsible cadres of various agencies should participate in Group A learning. This will not only allow responsible comrades to combine with grassroots backbones, making it easier to understand the situation and help lower levels solve problems, but also promote their own better learning.
　　The General Study Committee of the Bohai District Party Committee stipulates that group divisions should be based primarily on political level, followed by cultural level. Therefore, cadres at or equivalent to the level of the Prefectural Committee members are in Group A; key county-level cadres with considerable reading ability are in Group B; general cadres in agencies above the county level with self-study ability are in Group C; and agency cadres with low levels of education and no self-study ability are in Group D.
　　For the learning activities of the directly affiliated agencies of the CPC Subei District Committee and the Subei Administrative Office, groups are generally divided according to the level of political theory and education. Higher-level groups mainly rely on self-study, supplemented by discussions and informal talks. Based on the central learning issue, they divide the work to find reference materials, study them in detail, and then make central speeches at discussion meetings. For lower-level groups with lower political levels and no self-study ability, the Study Committee provides assistance, offers supplementary lessons, identifies central issues, first makes a report, and then asks everyone to discuss, so that everyone can easily grasp the center and better utilize study time.
　　The General Study Committee of the CPC Subei District Committee and the Subei Administrative Office issued a notice to all branch study committees on November 17, emphasizing the importance of studying the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, requiring all branch committees to attach great importance to the leadership of this study, and to carefully summarize experiences; problems that cannot be solved should be reported promptly. After the study, the General Study Committee will issue uniform test questions based on the level of knowledge and conduct formal tests. Those who emphasize objective difficulties and do not study seriously, and whose test scores are low, whether individuals or branch committees, will be subject to certain criticisms.
　　In the resolution of the first meeting of the General Study Committee of Pingyuan Province directly under the central government regarding learning issues, a method of testing and inspection was determined: at the beginning of each new learning phase, the study committee of each unit will issue review questions, including as many key points of the document as possible, to allow cadres to review, and then conduct a test. The purpose of the test is not only to stimulate the learning enthusiasm of cadres, but mainly to understand the level of understanding of cadres and to improve cadre learning through testing. Therefore, for cadres above the county level, it is not necessary to gather together to answer; understanding questions can be given, allowing cadres to find reference books and produce papers or answers on a regular basis.
　　Regarding the responsible cadres of various levels of agencies, the Study Committee suggests that the Provincial Party Committee should regularly conduct spot checks on their notes and read their study reports in person in order to discover problems and help them improve their learning and leadership.

### 各地学习集锦

　　各地学习集锦
    沈阳市的学习编组是根据干部的理论文化水平分编为不同的组。关于编组问题，市委宣传部部长宋黎曾向各单位负责人作了如下的解释：因为这不是政治待遇问题，所以能够学理论的学理论，不能学理论的学文化，学习文化就是为了学理论作准备。
    平原省直总学委会规定：学习小组一般应以政治理论水平为标准划分，并照顾文化水平以及各单位的具体情况。大体上是将地级与县级学习能力强的划成甲组，县级及区级学习能力强的划为乙组，各机关负责干部应参加甲组学习，这样既可以使负责同志与下层骨干相结合，便于了解情况，帮助下级解决问题，同时也可以推动自己更好的学习。
    渤海区党委学委总会规定：划组以政治水平为主要条件；其次是文化水平。因此地委委员以上及相当地委委员的干部为甲组；具有相当阅读能力的县级主要干部为乙组；县委以上机关具有自学能力的一般干部为丙组；文化程度低没有自学能力的机关干部为丁组。
    中共苏北区党委与苏北行署各直属机关的学习，一般的按政治理论水平和文化程度的分组，水平较高的小组，采取自学为主，讨论漫谈为辅，根据学习的中心问题，分工找参考材料，详细研究，然后在讨论会上作中心发言。对政治水平较低没有自学能力的小组，则由学委会帮助，上辅助课，并找出中心问题，先作报告，再要大家讨论，这样使大家容易抓住中心，更好的运用学习时间。
    苏北区党委与行署直属机关总学委会于十一月十七日通知各分支学委会：强调学习人民政协文件的重要，要求各分支会十分重视这一学习的领导，认真总结经验；有解决不了的问题迅速汇报。学习结束后，总学委会将根据水平高低，颁布统一测验题，进行正式测验。如有强调客观困难不认真学习，测验成绩低劣的，不问个人或支会，均将受到一定的批评。
    平原省直总学委会第一次会议关于学习问题的决议中，决定了测验检查方法：每一新的学习阶段开始时，由各单位学委发复习题，尽量包括文件要点，让干部复习，然后测验。测验的目的不仅是刺激干部学习情绪，主要的是了解干部领会程度并经过测验提高干部学习，因此对县以上干部，不一定集中到一块答，可以出理解题，让干部找参考书，定期作出论文或答案。
    对各级机关负责干部，学委会建议省委应定期亲自抽查笔记，阅读其学习报告，以便发现问题，帮助其改进学习，改进领导。
