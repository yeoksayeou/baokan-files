    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th] TASS, Moscow: The "Pravda" recently published a dispatch from its Paris correspondent, Yuri Zhukov, describing how the French people are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday.
    Zhukov wrote: Workers and peasants, scientists and writers, housewives and artisans – all honest French people who are fighting for peace and for the independence of their country, against foreign oppression – these days are turning their eyes to the great leader and teacher of the world's people, expressing their love and gratitude. Many touching letters, filled with sincere and noble feelings, are pouring into the editorial department of "l'Humanité" from all over France.
    One only has to read this large pile of letters to see how enthusiastically the whole of France is preparing to celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday.
    The people of France, with love, I would say, with tender love, commemorate the upcoming birthday.

    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载驻巴黎记者尤里·朱可夫的通讯，叙述法国人民热烈筹备庆祝斯大林七十诞辰的情形。
    朱可夫写道：法国的工人和农民，科学家和著作家，主妇和手工业者——一切为和平和为祖国独立，反对外国压迫而奋斗的诚实的法国人，这几天都把视线转向世界人民伟大的领袖和导师的身上，表示他们的爱和感激。许多充满着真诚崇高感情的动人的信，从法国各地纷纷送到“人道报”的编辑部。
    人们一读这大堆大堆的信，便足以看出法国全境对于庆祝斯大林七十诞辰的筹备，是多么热烈。
    法国的人民，带着爱，我要说，是带着温柔的爱，来纪念即将到临的诞辰。
