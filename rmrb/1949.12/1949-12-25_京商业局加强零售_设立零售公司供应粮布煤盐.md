　　Beijing Commercial Bureau Strengthens Retail
  　Establishes Retail Company to Supply Grain, Cloth, Coal and Salt
    [Beijing News] In accordance with the order of the Central Trade Department to establish retail companies to strengthen the direct supply of daily necessities to citizens, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau has reorganized the Beijing Supply Stores into the Beijing Retail Company. The business scope of the Retail Company is temporarily set to include four kinds of daily necessities: grain, cloth, coal, and salt. Daily necessities will gradually be added later. The supply targets are general workers, urban poor, teachers, students, and other working people. Cooperative members are not supplied because they already enjoy preferential treatment. Currently, the Retail Company has a total of 365 retail stores of various types, including: 13 grain business offices (12 in the urban area, 1 in Mentougou in the suburbs), under which are 111 retail stores and 32 consignment stores; 192 coal briquette retail stores; and 17 cotton cloth retail stores.
