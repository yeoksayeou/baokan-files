　　Endorsing the Implementation of the 1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget
    Zhang Naiqi
　　(I)
    When I personally saw the 1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget, I was filled with boundless joy and admiration from the bottom of my heart!
    The revolutionary military operations have not yet ended, and the Central People's Government has only been established for two months, yet it has been able to provide a national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget. I think that in the history of all countries in the world, even if it is not unprecedented, it is at least rare. As Chairman Mao said, this is a major event, and in this major event, it shows that we "have solutions." After imperialism and its lackeys encountered shameful failures in China, they continuously raved with a feeling of "coalition for self-relief," saying: "The Chinese Communist Party has won militarily, but it will still fail economically." In the past six months, on the economic front, we have defeated the enemy's frantic blockade of our coasts, defeated the enemy's brutal destruction of our transportation, and also defeated the conspiracies of speculators and profiteers stirring up trouble in our markets. The facts have sufficiently proven that under the correct leadership of the CCP, the strength of the Chinese people cannot be humiliated. Now, the Central People's Government seizes the opportunity and has created a national budget for the next year that can be called perfect at this time and place, which is a more powerful response to the enemies of the people. Let them wait and see! Endless victories will flood their eyes until they fall down themselves, and then they will see nothing.
　　(II)
    Looking at the fiscal revenue, we should truly express our greatest gratitude to the farmers. Because public grain—that is, agricultural tax revenue—accounts for 41.4 percent of the total revenue, ranking first. Other tax revenues—mainly urban taxes—account for only 38.9 percent. According to the report of the North China People's Government, in the one year from September 1948 to September 1949 in North China, indirect taxes accounted for 65.5 percent of urban tax revenue, and most of this was still passed on to the farmers. The average burden on farmers nationwide accounts for slightly more than 19 percent of their total agricultural income, while in the old liberated areas, it accounts for 21 percent of their total agricultural income. Why do the old liberated areas have a greater capacity to bear the burden? This is mainly due to the completion of land reform and the restoration of agricultural productivity. The CCP's land policy once again proves the correctness of its policy of benefiting both the public and private sectors, and it can be generally seen that the longer the days of liberation, the more solutions the people and the country will have. In order to overcome financial difficulties, the People's Government cannot completely reduce the burden on farmers at present. However, at the same time, the government will reduce disaster losses for farmers through improvements in water conservancy. It will help farmers increase their income by supplying agricultural tools, animal power, fertilizers, and seeds, promoting by-products, and facilitating financial turnover and marketing adjustments. It will also try to eliminate the scissors difference between the prices of agricultural products and industrial products in the market as much as possible to improve and raise the living standards of farmers. The report of Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Northeast People's Government that "the amount of cloth that farmers in the Northeast can exchange for one ton of sorghum this year has increased by 200 percent compared with the winter of 1946" is a very realistic example.
    Various taxes account for 38.9 percent of the total revenue, which is naturally mainly borne by industrialists and businesspeople. However, employees and ordinary citizens may also share a few percentage points of it. Assuming that 90 percent of it is borne by industrialists and businesspeople, and that according to the experience of North China, 65.5 percent of the burden on industrialists and businesspeople is indirect tax, and assuming that 90 percent of the indirect tax is passed on to farmers and other citizens, then the pure burden on industrialists and businesspeople accounts for only 15.7 percent of the total revenue. This percentage is, of course, very small. The basic reason for the small percentage is naturally that the proportion of industrial production in the national economy is also very small—except for the Northeast, it only accounts for about 10 percent. However, according to the past situation in North China, the industrial and commercial income tax levied in Beijing and Tianjin averaged no more than 20 percent of their net income, while the agricultural tax in North China accounted for 20 percent of the farmers' total agricultural income. Obviously, 20 percent of the total revenue is much heavier than 20 percent of the net income. Understanding from the actual situation, it can be seen everywhere that the burden on farmers is heavier than that on industrialists and businesspeople. Therefore, this time, the Central People's Government issued 200 million shares of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds to solve 38.4 percent of the total fiscal deficit (the total deficit accounts for 18.7 percent of the expenditure), which is about 7.2 percent of the expenditure, requiring mainly industrialists and businesspeople to subscribe, which truly conforms to the principle of "fair burden."
    Following public grain and various taxes is the income of state-owned enterprises, accounting for 17.1 percent of the total revenue, income from clearing warehouses accounts for 2.4 percent, and other income accounts for 0.2 percent. State-owned enterprises have been tragically destroyed by bandits everywhere, and in many places, the degree of destruction exceeded 50 percent. Therefore, in the vast new liberated areas, the expenditure on restoration work is a very heavy burden on finances, and there is no talk of income at all. Although the percentage of income from state-owned enterprises in the budget is not high, it is already commendable. It is fully expected that the income from this item will grow rapidly year by year. This beautiful seedling is worthy of cherishing and protecting by the entire nation.
　　(III)
    Summarizing in this way, the total amount of fiscal revenue is still only equal to 81.3 percent of the expenditure. That is to say, the fiscal deficit will account for 18.7 percent of the expenditure. It should be said that for China, which has gone through eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of the War of Liberation, in the first year of the national budget when the military period has not yet passed, showing a deficit of less than 20 percent can be said to be the best in the revolutionary history of various countries. What I personally feel particularly gratified about is that this deficit is close to the estimates between July and August. This confirms the words of Finance Minister Bo Yibo: "Many figures are estimates, but they are based on and close to reality, and are relatively reliable." Communists have an unattainable characteristic, which is "seeking truth from facts," being able to say it and do it, and even preferring to say less and do more. This is not only the opposite of the Kuomintang bureaucrats who "say all the good things and do all the bad things," but it is also what our general intellectuals lack. Based on this understanding, we should learn this characteristic on the one hand, and give this budget the greatest trust on the other hand, and work together to achieve the goals of the budget.
    This 18.7 percent of the expenditure, in addition to relying on the issuance of public bonds to make up for 38.4 percent of it, there is still 61.6 percent left, which is still made up by increasing the issuance of banknotes. That is to say, 11.5 percent of the budget expenditure needs to inflate the currency. Due to the rapid expansion of the liberated areas, the land and population have now exceeded the "golden age" of the Kuomintang, and this small increase in issuance will not be a problem. After the issuance of public bonds, with the cooperation of various efforts, prices will tend to stabilize. The stability of prices will allow the masses of the people to keep a little more RMB in hand, and they will not rush to sell currency to grab materials. The abnormal phenomenon of using gold, silver, and materials other than RMB as calculation and even circulation tools will also be quickly eliminated. In that way, the increase in the natural demand for RMB will greatly exceed the need to make up for the fiscal deficit. At that time, the People's Government may also be able to free up more funds to invest in restoring production and construction and cultural uses. This point is also entirely possible based on the experience of the Northeast in the past two years.
　　(IV)
    Judging from the budget revenue, our finances are completely built on the basis of "self-reliance." The representatives of imperialism can put away their arrogant propaganda! What "the new Chinese regime must rely on the assistance of capitalist countries to restore its economy," what "new China will eventually beg for help from Western countries,"... But the iron facts are enough to prove that new China can "self-rely." We are not afraid of blockades, nor do we solely rely on foreign aid. Doing business under the principle of equality and mutual benefit is possible. The assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal New Democratic countries is welcome, but a basis of "self-reliance" is still needed. This is entirely in line with Marshal Stalin's famous saying that "revolution is not an export." Once foreign aid from fraternal countries arrives, we can rationally allocate it in the restoration of production construction and cultural expenditure in a very planned way to alleviate our difficulties and accelerate the progress of restoration work.
    We have great confidence in the successful completion of the budget revenue task. As mentioned above, the estimate is based on and close to the facts, which is one condition. We have many astute and capable financial and economic work leaders who are good at grasping policies, good at using tactics, courageous in taking responsibility, and able to gain the trust of cadres, distributed in the central government and various regions; we also have a large number of excellent and experienced financial and economic cadres who are good at implementing policies and can often accomplish tasks, guarding the large and small, high and low positions, which is a more reliable condition. Under their concerted efforts, to achieve this grounded and near-factual budget task, although the work is arduous, it must be successful. Of course, more importantly, the development of the military situation is completely favorable to us, and the speed of development has exceeded our expectations.
　　(V)
    Now let's understand the budget expenditure.
    First of all: military expenditure accounts for only 38.8 percent of the expenditure. In the period when the war is still going on, it is truly commendable that military expenditure has such a percentage. This is a world apart from the Kuomintang era, when military expenditure often reached 70 to 80 percent and was not in accordance with the budget. This tells the world that new China is a peace-loving country. This tells the people of the whole country that the people's regime will make the greatest efforts to engage in peaceful construction, so that everyone can live a life of peace and contentment.
    Regarding this point, we must also sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army. The large number of troops exceeds the historical record of China. The Kuomintang reactionaries once had a larger establishment of personnel, but the actual number of people was discounted by 30 to 20 percent, and there were not as many as we will have in the future or even today. However, our expenses are far lower than theirs. The average expenditure per person is probably less than half of theirs; but our soldiers live better than them—of course, it is still very difficult. Spending less and being able to win battles frequently, and being able to complete such a great historical task, is certainly due to the correct revolutionary theory and superior leadership, but the spirit of the commanders and fighters, who are not afraid of hardship and self-sacrifice, makes anyone who sees them express their utmost respect.
    Because of the hard work of the People's Liberation Army, everyone cannot help but follow their example in using money. This great exemplary role is sufficient to guarantee that the budget expenditure for the next year can be strictly observed, and there will be no possibility of breaking through. What is even more welcome is that Chairman Mao, following the passage of the budget, issued a message on December 5 calling on the entire army to participate in production and construction work. This will not only allow the People's Liberation Army to have a better life and reduce the people's guilt, but also increase materials for the country and speed up construction work, which is also sufficient to help stabilize the currency value and help improve people's lives. As Chairman Mao said, "The People's Liberation Army is not only a national defense army, but also a production army." New China has such an army, and it is something to be proud of from any point of view. This wise measure not only provides another guarantee for the thorough implementation of the budget expenditure, but also adds another ray of light to the prospects of the new country's construction.
    The next item in terms of expenditure is administrative expenses, accounting for 21.4 percent. What makes us extremely moved here is that the average living expenses of old cadres on the supply system are almost the same as those of the People's Liberation Army, which is more than half lower than the average for those on the salary system. With the Communist Party members taking the lead in saving money for the country by working hard themselves, it is another guarantee for the thorough implementation of the budget expenditure. This item also includes the living expenses of a considerable number of former personnel in the Kuomintang military, government, and cultural and educational institutions. This is to thoroughly implement Article 7 of the Common Program, ensuring that the former personnel will not be displaced and will have a way out of life. This is not only beneficial to the former personnel, but also beneficial to the entire people. This generous, far-sighted policy is also rare in history. The former personnel will inevitably understand that they had no guarantee of life at all when they worked in the Kuomintang reactionary government. Changing a director official could cause them to pack their bags. Now, after a world-shaking revolution, they can still take care of their lives, which should be unexpected, right? But, despite this, a small number of people who used to live in luxury will feel that their lives are not good enough; moreover, this small number of people is the most likely to take an inch and want a mile. Therefore, we must ask them to check the history in a vertical direction to see when there has ever been such a generous policy, and in a horizontal direction, they must also look at the People's Liberation Army and all the old cadres in the work who have made great contributions, and see if their lives are better than theirs. There is no need to mention what kind of lives the vast number of farmers are living. This kind of understanding is beneficial, both to the implementation of the budget expenditure and to the ideological transformation of those few people.
　　(VI)
    The third item of expenditure is investment in state-owned enterprises, accounting for 23.9 percent of the expenditure. It is truly not easy for us to free up such an amount to invest at this time. The vast majority of this investment is only for restoration purposes. From this point, we can know how serious the intentional and unintentional destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries was! At the same time, we can also see how enthusiastic the new country is about construction.
    The fourth place in expenditure is cultural, educational, and health expenses, accounting for 4.1 percent. If we add the personnel expenses under the administrative expenses item, it accounts for 6 percent. This number is a little small, and it will inevitably gradually increase in the future. But even if it is a little small, the lives of our cultural, educational, and health workers have been considerably improved, and the progress of their work is obviously full of vitality, which is absolutely different from the lifelessness of the reactionary rule era. This symbolizes the greatness of the era and proves that in the great era, despite the hardships, there are still solutions.
    After that, there are local subsidies accounting for 2.3 percent of the expenditure, principal and interest payments on Northeast public bonds accounting for 0.1 percent, and general reserve funds accounting for 9.4 percent. We have a relatively large general reserve fund, which can adjust some possible deviations in the budget and cope with some temporary difficulties, which adds another guarantee for the thorough implementation of the budget.
　　(VII)
    The budget did not announce the actual figures and detailed explanations. This is because the remnants of imperialism and the reactionaries are still conspiring to sabotage, and we cannot publicly disclose a blueprint for governance to them so that they can exploit loopholes and carry out their sabotage tactics. This is not to prevent the people from knowing, but to keep secrets from the enemy. Preventing the enemy is being loyal to the people, and it is hoped that the people of the whole country can understand this. It may be made public to the people of the whole country when it can be made public. I believe that the result of the public disclosure will make everyone doubly jubilant. Because its amount is much smaller than the sum of the central and local budgets in the Kuomintang era, and it does much more, and the distribution of uses is worthy of the four big words "careful calculation."
    The creation of the budget proves that the Central People's Government is determined to implement every sentence and every word of the Common Program. Article 40 of the program stipulates: "Regarding finance: establish a national budget and final account system, divide the scope of central and local finances, strictly implement streamlining and thrift, gradually balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, and accumulate national production funds." The 1950 budget fully complies with the spirit of this clause.
    The budget proves Chairman Mao's words that we "have difficulties, have solutions, and have hope." Chairman Mao told us "do not hide difficulties." Indeed, not hiding difficulties makes it easier to think of solutions. Revolution is originally a hopeful cause, but having solutions can further increase our hope.
    May the people of the whole country unite and fight for this hopeful prospect!

　　拥护执行一九五○年度全国财政收支概算
    章乃器
　　（一）
    我个人在看到了一九五○年度全国财政收支概算的时候，从心坎里激动了无限的欢欣，无限的赞佩！
    革命军事尚未结束，中央人民政府成立了只有两个月，居然能够提供出来一个全国性的财政收支概算。我想，在世界各国的历史上，即使不是空前，至少是不可多得的。这正如毛主席所说，是一件大事，而在这一件大事当中，表现出来我们是“有办法的”。帝国主义和它的走狗们在中国遭遇到可耻的失败之后，曾经以“联以自解”的心情，不断的在那里狂吠：“中国共产党赢得了军事，在经济上还是要失败的。”半年以来，在经济战线上，我们已经战胜了敌人对我海岸的疯狂封锁，战胜了敌人对我交通的残酷破坏，也战胜了投机奸商在我市场上的兴风作浪的阴谋。事实已经足够证明，在中共的正确领导之下，中国人民的力量是不可侮的。现在，中央人民政府把握时机，作成了一个在此时此地堪称尽善尽美的明年度全国概算，是对于人民的敌人们的一个更有力的答复。请他们等着看吧！层出不穷的胜利事实将会涌现在他们的眼前。直至他们自己倒下去了，那才一切都看不见了。
　　（二）
    从财政收入来看，我们真应该向农民致最大的感谢。因为，公粮——即农业税的收入，占总收入的百分之四十一点四，居第一位。其他各项税收——主要的为城市税，仅占百分之三十八点九。依据华北人民政府的报告，华北在一九四八年九月至一九四九年九月的一年中间，在城市税收中，间接税占百分之六十五点五，这大部分仍是转嫁给农民的。全国农民平均负担，占其农业总收入的百分之十九强，而老解放区则占其农业总收入的百分之二十一。老解放区为什么会有较大的负担力？这主要的就靠土地改革的完成和农业生产力的恢复。中共的土地政策在这里再一次证明其公私两利政策的正确，而解放日子愈长，人民和国家都愈有办法，也可概见了。人民政府为着要战胜财政困难，在目前还不可能完全减轻农民的负担。然而，同时，政府将在水利的改善上减少农民的灾荒损害。在农具、畜力、肥料、种子的供应，副产的推广，金融的周转和运销的调剂上，帮助农民增加收入。还要在市场的运用上尽可能消灭农产品和工业品价格的剪刀差，以改善提高农民的生活。东北人民政府李富春副主席报告：“东北今年农民的一吨高高所换的布，与一九四六冬季比较，已提高了百分之二百”，便是一个很现实的例子。
    各项税收占总收入的百分之三十八点九，这主要的自然是工商业者的负担，然而，职工和一般市民也可能分担其中的百分之几。假定其中有百分之九十是工商业者的负担，而工商业者的负担当中，依据华北的经验，有百分之六十五点五是间接税，间接税当中又假定有百分之九十转嫁给农民和其他市民，那么，工商业者的纯负担，就只占总收入的百分之十五点七了。这个百分比，当然是很微小了。微小的原因，基本的自然是由于工业生产在国民经济中所占的比重也很微小——东北除外只占百分之十左右。可是，依据华北过去的情形，京津两市征收工商业所得税，平均未超过其纯收入的百分之二十，而华北农业税，则已占农民的农业总收入的百分之二十。很明显的，总收入的百分之二十比起纯收入的百分之二十，是沉重得多了。从实际情况去了解，农民负担要比工商业者沉重，也是随处可以见得到的。因此，这次中央人民政府发行一九五○年人民胜利折实公债二万万分，以解决财政赤字总数的百分之三十八点四（赤字总数占支出的百分之十八点七），约合支出的百分之七点二，要求主要的由工商业者认购，真是符合“公平负担”的原则了。
    列在公粮和各项税收之后的，便是公营企业收入，占总收入的百分之十七点一，清理仓库收入占百分之二点四，其他收入占百分之零点二。公营企业曾到处惨遭匪帮的破坏，许多地方被破坏的程度超过了百分之五十。因此，在广大的新解放区里，修复工作的支出是财政上很沉重的负担，根本谈不到收入。概算上公营企业的收入，百分比虽然不高，已经是难能可贵的了。这是完全可以预期的，这一项目的收入，将会逐年迅速的长大。这一颗美丽的幼苗，是值得全国上下珍惜爱护的。
　　（三）
    这样归总起来，财政收入的总额，依然只合支出的百分之八十一点三。那就是说，财政赤字要占支出的百分之十八点七。应该说，经过了八年抗日战争和四年解放战争的中国，在军事时期还未过去的第一年度的全国概算上，只表现不到百分之二十的赤字，在各国的革命历史当中，也可说是再好不过了。我个人感到特别快慰的是，这一个赤字，和七、八月间的估计接近。这证实了薄一波财政部长的话：“许多数目字都是估计的，但是有根据的，是接近实际的，比较可靠的。”共产党员有一个不可及的特点，就是“实事求是”，说得出，做得到，甚至是宁可说得少一些，做得多一些。这不但和国民党官僚们“好话说尽，坏事做完”刚刚相反，而且也是我们一般的知识分子所欠缺的。根据这一点的认识，我们一面应该学习这一种特点，一面却可以给这一个概算以最大的信任，一致为实现概算的目标而努力。
    这占支出的百分之十八点七的赤字，除依靠发行公债弥补了其中的百分之三十八点四以外，剩下来还有百分之六十一点六，依然是靠增加钞票发行来弥补的。那就是说，概算支出中的百分之十一点五，需要膨胀通货。由于解放地区的迅速扩大，在目前，土地和人口已经超过了国民党的“全盛时期”，这一点点的发行的增加，是不会成什么问题的。公债发行之后，配合各种的努力，物价将趋稳定。物价的稳定将使得人民大众在手头多保持一点人民币，不会急于抛出货币抢购物资，那些用人民币以外的金银物资作为计算以至流通工具的畸形现象，也会很快的消灭。那样，人民币的自然需求的增加，将会大大的超过了弥补财政赤字的所需。那时，人民政府还可能腾出来多一些的资金，投到恢复生产建设和文化用途上去。这一点，依据东北两年来的经验，也是完全可能的。
　　（四）
    从概算收入来看，我们的财政是完全建筑在“自力更生”的基础之上的。帝国主义的代表们可以收起他们的狂妄宣传了！什么“中国新政权必须依赖资本主义国家的援助，才能恢复经济”咧，“新中国终久会向西方国家乞援”咧，……但铁的事实足够证明，新中国是可以“自力更生”的。我们不怕封锁，也不单单依赖国外的援助。在平等互利的原则之下做买卖是可以的。苏联和其他新民主主义兄弟国家的援助是欢迎的，但依然需要一个“自力更生”的基础。这完全符合斯大林大元帅“革命不是输出品”的一句名言。一旦兄弟国家的外援到来了，我们便可以很有计划的在恢复生产建设和文化的支出上合理的分配，以减轻我们的困难，加速恢复工作的进度。
    我们对概算收入的圆满达成任务具有极大的信心。如上文所说，估计是根据而接近事实的，是一个条件。我们有许多精明强干，善于掌握政策，善于运用战术，勇于负责，而又能得干部信任的财经工作领导人，分配在中央和各地区；我们还有大批优秀而有经验的，善于执行政策的，经常能达成任务的财经干部，把守着大大小小高高低低的岗位，这是一个更可靠的条件。在他们的协同努力之下，达成这一个有根据而接近事实的概算任务，尽管工作是艰巨的，然而一定可以成功的。当然，更重要的，还是军事形势的发展完全对我们有利，发展的速度而且超过了我们的预期。
　　（五）
    现在再来认识一下概算的支出。
    首先是：军事费的支出只占支出的百分之三十八点八。在战争还在进行的时期，军事费只有这样的一个百分比，真是难能可贵的了。这和国民党时代，军事支出经常要达百分之七八十，而且是不依照预算的，真有天渊之别了。这告诉了全世界，新中国是一个爱好和平的国家。这告诉了全国人民，人民的政权将以最大的努力从事于和平建设，使得大家能过安居乐业的日子。
    关于这一点，我们还得衷心的感谢人民解放军，军队人数的众多，是超过了中国的历史纪录的。国民党反动派曾经有过更庞大一些的编制员额，但，实际的人数是七折八扣的，是没有我们将来甚至今天那么多的。但，我们的开支，却远比他们低。我们平均每一个人的花费可能不到他们的半数；可是我们的战士却比他们生活得好一些——当然还是很艰苦。花费少而能够经常的打胜仗，能够完成这样一个历史的伟大任务，固然是由于有了正确的革命理论和优越的领导，然而全体指战员们不怕艰苦、自我牺牲的精神，是使任何人见了都表示万分崇敬的。
    由于人民解放军的刻苦，使得大家在用钱上不能不向他们看齐。这一种伟大的模范作用，足以保证明年度概算支出方面能够严格遵守，不会有突破的可能。更值得欢迎的是，毛主席跟着概算的通过，于十二月五日发表文告号召全军参加生产建设工作。这将一面使得人民解放军可能得到好一些的生活，减少了人民心中的歉疚，另一面为国家增加物资，为建设工作提高速度，又是足以帮助稳定币值，帮助改善人民生活的。正如毛主席所说，“人民解放军不仅是一支国防军，而且是一支生产军。”新中国有这样的一支军队，不管从什么角度看，都是值得骄傲的。这一个明智的措施，不但使概算支出的贯彻执行得到了又一重的保障，而且使新国家建设的前景增加了又一道的光明。
    支出方面的次一个项目是行政费，占百分之二十一点四。这里使我们万分感动的，便是按照供给制的老干部，平均每个人的生活费几乎和解放军差不多，比较按薪给制的，平均要低一半多。有了共产党员在刻苦自己替国家省钱的方面起了带头的作用，是概算支出彻底执行的另一重保障。在这个项目里，还包含了为数颇巨的国民党军政文教机构里的旧人员的生活费。这是为着彻底实行共同纲领的第七条，保证旧人员不致流离失所，而且还有生活出路。这不但对于旧人员有利，对于全体人民也都是有利的。这种宽大的，远见的政策，也是历史上罕见的。旧人员们必然会明白，他们过去在国民党反动政府工作，根本上就没有生活的保障。换了一个主任官就可能使他们卷铺盖。现在，经过了一次翻天复地的革命，反而还能照顾到他们的生活，应该是意想不到的吧？但，尽管如此，少数过去养尊处优的人们，会感觉到生活不够；而且，这少数人是最会得寸进尺的。因此，我们必须要求他们，在纵的方面查一查历史，看那个时期曾经有过这样宽大的政策，在横的方面还要看一看那些劳苦功高的人民解放军和一切工作中的老干部，生活有没有比他们好。广大的农民在过什么生活，那就不必提了。这种理解是有益的，既利于概算支出的执行，又利于那少数人们的思想改造。
　　（六）
    支出的第三个项目是国营企业投资，占支出的百分之二十三点九。我们能在这个时期腾出这样一个数目来投资，真已经是不容易的了。这种投资，绝大多数只是供恢复的用途。从这点我们可以知道，国民党反动派有意的和无意的破坏是如何的严重！同时也可以看出来，新国家对于建设是如何的热情。
    支出的第四位是文化教育卫生费，占百分之四点一。倘使加上行政费项下的人员开支，则占百分之六。这个数目是小一点，将来必然会逐步的增加。但纵然小一些，我们的文教卫生工作人员的生活，已经有了相当的改善，工作的进行显然也已经是生气蓬勃，绝对不同于反动统治时代的死气沉沉。这象征着时代的伟大，证明了在伟大的时代里面，尽管艰苦，还是有办法的。
    之后，便是地方补助费占支出的百分之二点三，东北公债还本付息百分之零点一，和总预备费的百分之九点四。我们有一笔比较大的总预备费，可以调剂一些概算上可能的偏差，可以应付一些临时发生的困难，这又增加了一道彻底执行概算的保障。
　　（七）
    概算不曾公布实际的数字和详细的说明。这是因为帝国主义和反动派的残余还在阴谋破坏，我们不能将一幅施政的蓝图向他们公开，让他们可以钻空子遂行其破坏的技俩。这并不是不让人民知道，而是对敌人守秘密。对敌人的防范就是对人民的忠实，这一点是希望全国人民能够谅解的。到可以公开的时期，也可能对全国人民公开。我相信，公开的结果，将会使大家加倍的欢欣鼓舞。因为，它的数目，要比国民党时代的中央和地方概算的总和小得多，而事情要比他们做得多得多，用途的分配更是当得起“精打细算”四个大字的。
    概算的作成，证明了中央人民政府是决心要实行共同纲领的每一句和每一个字的。纲领第四十条规定“关于财政：建立国家预算决算制度，划分中央和地方的财政范围，厉行精简节约，逐步平衡财政收支，积累国家生产资金。”一九五○年的概算完全符合这一条款的精神。
    概算证明了毛主席的话，我们是“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的”。毛主席告诉我们“不要隐瞒困难”。的确，不隐瞒困难就容易想出来办法。革命本来是有希望的事业，但，有了办法就更可以增加我们的希望。
    愿全国人民一致为这一个光明在望的希望而奋斗！
    一九四九、一二、一三。
