　　Demonstrating to the Imperialists
　　——A Special Report on the Asian Women's Representative Conference
　　Bai Sheng
　　When the seventeen representatives of the conference presidium, led by Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and Cai Chang, Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, stepped onto the rostrum amidst warm applause, Comrade Bafanova, head of the Soviet delegation, enthusiastically and excitedly shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" This sound continuously vibrated in the hearts of everyone in the audience. At this moment, the Asian Women's Representative Conference, representing hundreds of millions of women from more than twenty countries across Asia, and bearing significant historical and international importance, opened in Beijing, the capital of the victorious People's Republic of China. This was on the afternoon of December 10, 1949.
　　Today, this conference, eagerly awaited by women all over the world, especially in Asia, is attended not only by representatives from Asian countries, but also by progressive women from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, as well as women from oppressed African countries, all of whom are honored guests of the conference. Among these women representatives, some come from faraway tropical rubber plantations, others from the cold outside the Great Wall grasslands; there are women representatives from the six republics of the Soviet Union who have been completely liberated, live free and happy lives, and are at the forefront of women in Asian countries, representatives from China, Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam who are actively engaged in the cause of New Democratic construction, and also women representatives from those oppressed, enslaved, and bound colonial and semi-colonial countries—India, Malaya, Burma, Iran, and other places, some of whom even risked their lives to attend this conference. Here, they will exchange experiences in struggle and construction, and discuss how women in Asia can strengthen unity and connections. This conference will provide great support and encouragement to the national liberation struggles and women's liberation struggles in various colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, and to the struggle against aggression and to ensure lasting world peace. This is a victorious conference of unity, a conference to demonstrate to the imperialists!
　　As early as October last year, the Women's International Democratic Federation originally decided to hold this conference in India, but it was obstructed by the reactionary Nehru government of India. It was not until the summer of this year that, due to the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the unanimous and enthusiastic demands of many member states, the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation decided to hold it in China this December. Today, let the warmongers, the imperialists, and their lackeys tremble! They cannot stop the liberation of women. The women of Asia and the women of the whole world have united closely. Their songs of liberation have already been sung aloud in Beijing, the capital of the victorious New China. Their roars against aggressive wars and in defense of world peace have shaken the whole world.
　　Today, the atmosphere at the venue is so intimate, united, and harmonious, and the entire venue is filled with great internationalist love. On the light blue backdrop, the five-colored and magnificent national flags of thirty-one countries are tightly inserted, with the conference emblem, featuring a map of Asia and a white dove of peace, in the center. When more than two hundred women representatives from different countries walked into the venue vigorously, each representative's face was filled with a triumphant smile. From their persons, I seemed to see the strong Soviet women who bravely undertake the roles of drivers, iron rollers, tractor operators, and combine harvesters on the production front; I also seemed to see the Mongolian women of the cavalry who fought bravely against Japanese imperialism in the cold highland desert areas; I also seemed to see the heroines who participated in the great Chinese Red Army's 25,000-li Long March and the long-term War of Resistance Against Japan; I also seemed to see the Indonesian women who grew up in the anti-imperialist struggle with their robust physiques; I also seemed to see the Indian female workers and peasants who bravely carried out strikes and rent resistance movements, and the Malayan women who are launching a fierce anti-imperialist struggle in the tropical rubber plantations....
　　Everyone in the audience, from the opening speech of Cai Chang, Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation and Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, jointly felt that the convening of this conference was not easy and of great significance.
　　Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, pointed out even more forcefully that the convening of the Asian Women's Conference could not be stopped by any force. She said that today, the movement to defend world peace has been organized all over the world.
　　Every speaker similarly pointed out that the convening of this conference not only united the women of Asia, but also added a strong force to the anti-imperialist camp, making the Asian women's struggle for national independence and the struggle of women and people all over the world for lasting world peace and people's democracy more closely linked. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, emphasized that it is a particular honor for the people of Beijing that the Asian Women's Representative Conference could be held in Beijing, the capital of the victorious New China. Chen Shaomin, Executive Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liao Chengzhi, representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Yang Gang, representative of the International Association of Journalists, and others all delivered congratulatory speeches to the conference on behalf of their respective organizations. Children and women from Beijing enthusiastically presented flowers and flags to the conference. One hundred and two telegrams of congratulations to the conference from China and countries around the world repeatedly demonstrated how progressive people in all countries around the world are concerned about and watching this victorious conference of Asian women's unity.

　　向帝国主义者示威
    ——亚洲妇女代表会议特写
    柏生
    当以国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人、国际民主妇联副主席蔡畅为首的大会主席团十七位代表在热烈的掌声中步上主席台的时候，苏联代表团团长巴菲诺娃热情而激动地高呼“毛泽东万岁”，这声音，连续地振荡了全场每个人的心。这时，代表着全亚洲二十余个国家数万万妇女的，具有重大历史意义与国际意义的亚洲妇女代表会议，在胜利了的中华人民共和国的首都——北京揭幕了。——这是一九四九年十二月十日的下午。
    今天，这个全世界特别是亚洲妇女热烈盼望的大会，除亚洲各国代表参加外，更有从英、美、法、荷等国来的进步妇女以及非洲被压迫国家的妇女，她们都是大会的贵宾。在这些妇女代表里面，有的来自遥远的热带的橡树园里，有的来自寒冷的寨外草原；有已经得到彻底解放过着自由幸福生活，走在亚洲各国妇女前列的苏联六个共和国的妇女代表，有正积极从事新民主民义建设事业的中国、蒙古、朝鲜、越南的代表，也有那些被压迫、被奴役、被束缚的殖民地半殖民地的国家——印度、马来亚、缅甸、伊朗等地的妇女代表，她们有的甚至冒着生命的危险来出席这个大会。在这里，她们将要互相交流斗争与建设的经验，讨论全亚洲妇女如何加强团结和联系。这次会议将给亚洲各殖民地半殖民地国家的民族解放斗争与妇女解放斗争，反对侵略、保证世界持久和平的斗争以极大的支援和鼓励，这是一个团结的胜利的大会，是向帝国主义者示威的大会！
    还是在去年十月，国际民主妇联本来决定在印度召开这个会议，却被印度的尼赫鲁反动政府阻挠了。直到今年夏季，由于中国人民解放战争的胜利，和许多会员国一致热烈的要求，国际民主妇联执委会决定今年十二月在中国召开。今天，让战争贩子们，帝国主义者和他们的走狗们在那里发抖吧！他们要想阻止妇女的解放是办不到的，亚洲的妇女和全世界的妇女已经紧密地团结起来了，她们的解放的歌声已经在胜利了的新中国人民的首都北京高唱起来了，她们的反对侵略战争保卫世界和平的怒吼，已经震撼了全世界。
    今天会场上是显得那么亲密、团结、和谐，整个会场里洋溢着伟大的国际主义的热爱。淡蓝的壁幕上，紧紧的插着五色辉煌的三十一国的国旗，正中是以亚洲地图和一只白色和平之鸽作图案的大会会徽。当二百多个来自不同国度的妇女代表矫健地走进会场时，每一个代表的脸上都充满着胜利的微笑。从她们的身上，我仿佛看到了那些在生产战线上勇敢地担负起司机、碾铁、开拖拉机和联合收割机的刚强的苏联妇女们；我也仿佛看到了在寒冷的高原荒漠地带，与日本帝国主义英勇作战时的骑兵队的蒙古妇女们；我也仿佛看到了参加伟大的中国红军二万五千里长征和长期抗日战争中的女英雄们；我也仿佛看到了在反帝斗争中成长起来的那些体力茁壮的印尼妇女们；我也仿佛看到了那些英勇地进行罢工和抗租运动的印度女工们农妇们，和在那热带橡树园里正在掀起如火如荼的反帝斗争的马来亚妇女们……。
    全场的人们，从国际民主妇联副主席、中华全国妇联主席蔡畅的开幕词中，共同地感觉到这个会议的召开是不容易和意义重大的。
    国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人更有力地指出亚洲妇女会议的召开是没有任何力量能够阻挡得住的。她说，今天保卫世界和平运动已在全世界组织起来了。
    每一个讲话的来宾都同样地指出了这个会议的召开不仅是团结了亚洲的妇女，同时对反对帝国主义的阵营更增加了一个强大的力量，使亚洲妇女的争取民族独立的斗争以及全世界妇女和人民为世界持久和平与人民民主的斗争更加密切地联系起来。北京市副市长吴晗着重地指出，亚洲妇代会能够在胜利了的新中国人民首都——北京召开，这特别是北京人民的光荣。中华全国总工会执委陈少敏、世界民主青年联盟及中华全国民主青年联合总会代表廖承志、中华全国文联主席郭沫若、国际记者协会代表杨刚等均分别代表各团体向大会致祝词。北京的儿童及北京妇女并热烈向大会献花、献旗。一百零二个团体从中国以及世界各国来给大会的贺电，都一再的表现了全世界各国进步人民是怎样关心和注视着这个亚洲妇女团结的胜利的大会。
