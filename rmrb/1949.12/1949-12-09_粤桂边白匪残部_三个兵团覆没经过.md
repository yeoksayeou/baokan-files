Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 8th: A frontline reporter reported on the annihilation of the Third, Eleventh, and most of the Fourth Corps of the remnants of the White bandits on the Guangdong-Guangxi border, stating: After the Central South Field Army entered Guangxi in three routes and rapidly liberated vast areas such as Guilin, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou, the remnant Gui clique bandits fled south in a panic, attempting to seize the road to the Leizhou Peninsula and escape across the sea to Qiongya. The White bandits specifically ordered Zhang Gan's Third Corps and Lu Daoyuan's Eleventh Corps, consisting of five armies, to flee towards the Guangdong-Guangxi border, while the Guangdong bandit leader Yu Hanmou ordered the bandit 62nd Army, originally located at the southern tip of the Leizhou Peninsula, and the remnants of the bandit Shen Fazao's Fourth Corps on the Guangdong-Guangxi border to move north to meet them. Around the 20th of last month, after the White bandit troops fled to the area south of Rong County and Yulin, they began to flee towards the Lianjiang, Maoming, and Xinyi lines of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong on the 25th. However, the enemy was relentlessly pursued by our forces and was like a frightened bird, with morale declining and progress extremely slow, only reaching the Lianjiang and Bobai areas along the Guangdong-Guangxi border on the 27th. At this time, the main force of the People's Liberation Army in Guangdong Province was advancing westward at full speed, ready to fight. On the 27th, the bandit Third Corps, under the cover of artillery fire, used the main force of the bandit 7th Army to attack Xinyi, while the 48th and 126th Armies attacked Maoming with their main forces, launching fierce attacks on our positions all day long, but to no avail. The bandit Eleventh Corps' attack on Xinyi also made no progress. That afternoon, our army began to counterattack, first defeating the 7th Army near Baoxu, west of Xinyi, annihilating parts of the bandit 171st Division and the 686th Regiment of the 229th Division, killing and capturing more than 500 enemies. Another powerful PLA force bravely advanced towards the enemy's flank and quickly entered Guangxi Province. On the morning of the 28th, they liberated Rong County, and that night they occupied Beiliu, intercepting most of the remnant bandit 58th Army along the way, and on the evening of the 29th (previously misreported as the 30th), they liberated Yulin, an important town in southeastern Guangxi, defeating the bandit Lu Daoyuan's 11th Corps headquarters, and then liberating Bobai at dawn on the 1st, annihilating the bandit 3rd Corps headquarters and capturing the enemy Corps Commander Zhang Gan alive. At this time, the bandit army was in complete disarray and collapsed across the board. At the same time, the PLA forces on the Xinyi front bravely advanced westward, liberating Luchuan County in Guangxi Province at 2:00 AM on the 30th, and quickly joined forces with the troops liberating Bobai. Then, they tracked and pursued the enemy all the way, and between the 29th and 30th, they annihilated the entire 523rd Regiment and part of the 521st Regiment of the 175th Division of the 48th Army, as well as the entire 913th Regiment of the 305th Division of the 126th Army, killing and capturing more than 2,000 enemies, including Yang Lei, the commander of the 523rd Regiment.

　　Zhang Gan's Corps was originally the old foundation of the White bandits and the main force of the Gui clique. In the battle in the Wufeng Mountains southwest of Hengyang in mid-October this year, four divisions were annihilated, and their vitality was greatly damaged. This time, they were relentlessly pursued by our army for several days, and their morale was low. As soon as they made contact, the enemy abandoned their artillery and baggage and fled westward in a panic. The road was extremely crowded, and many people were crushed and drowned in the river while vying for the bridge when crossing the river at Baoxu. The defeated bandit troops either carried luggage on their shoulders or threw away their hats and shoes, looting all the way and forcibly selling their weapons to the residents. After our army's brave pursuit, the remnants of the bandits ran all over the mountains and fields, with a small number escaping, and most of them were captured or surrendered voluntarily.

　　While the White bandits in the north were fleeing south, the remnants of Shen Fazao's Fourth Corps in the Hepu area gathered the remnants of their 23rd, 63rd, and 70th Armies, as well as the 321st Division of the 109th Army and the pseudo Guangdong-Guangxi Border Advance Column, and invaded Lianjiang on the evening of the 29th. The PLA forces ambushing on the southern line immediately launched a swift attack from three directions from an area 100 miles west of Lianjiang, cutting the Shen bandit army into several sections at the waist. On the morning of the 30th, when the bandit troops entrenched near Lianjiang woke up from their sleep, they found themselves heavily surrounded and fought in a panic. But they were immediately beaten to pieces by our army and fled in all directions. The enemy 321st Division and the pseudo Guangdong-Guangxi Border Advance Column were completely annihilated ten miles southwest of the city, and Yu Yingqi, the lieutenant general commander of the bandit "Guangdong-Guangxi Border Bandit Suppression Headquarters," was captured. Then, the remnants of the 23rd Army entrenched in the north and east of the city also surrendered one after another. Seeing that the situation was not good, the remnants of the Shen bandit's rearguard 63rd Army turned their heads and fled west. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and on the 2nd, defeated the enemy 63rd Army in the Longtan Market and Gongshu Market areas west of Lianjiang County. Our soldiers competed to capture prisoners on the mountain valley roadsides. One part of our army advanced westward along the Guangdong-Guangxi coast, and on the evening of the 3rd, liberated Hepu County, an important coastal port in southwestern Guangdong. Only the Shen bandit remnants of the corps headquarters and some of the remnants of the 70th Army managed to escape by chance.

　　粤桂边白匪残部
  　三个兵团覆没经过
    【新华社华南前线八日电】前线记者报道粤桂边白匪残部第三、第十一兵团及第四兵团大部覆没的经过称：华中南下大军三路进入广西，并迅速解放桂林、柳州、梧州等广大地区后，桂系残匪没命南逃，妄图夺路雷州半岛越海逃往琼崖。白匪特令张淦第三兵团及鲁道源第十一兵团两兵团五个军向粤桂边窜犯，粤系匪首余汉谋则令原在雷州半岛南端的匪六十二军与粤桂边境的匪沈发藻第四兵团残部北上接应。上月二十日前后，白匪军窜抵容县、郁林以南地区后，二十五日开始向我雷州半岛廉江、茂名、信宜线窜犯。但敌连日遭我穷追，已如惊弓之鸟，士气颓丧，进展极缓，二十七日始达粤桂边境廉江、博白地区一线。此时广东境内人民解放军大军兼程西进，业已严阵以待。二十七日匪第三兵团在炮火掩护下以匪七军主力攻信宜，四十八军、一二六军主力攻茂名，竟日向我阵地猛犯，皆未得逞。匪十一兵团向信宜攻犯，亦毫无进展。当天下午，我军开始出击，首在信宜城西宝墟附近击溃第七军，歼匪一七一师及二二九师六八六团各一部，毙俘敌五百余。另路强大解放军则向敌侧背奋勇进军，迅速入桂境。二十八日晨解放容县，当晚进占北流，沿途截击残匪第五十八军大部，并于二十九日（前误报为三十日）晚解放桂东南重镇郁林，击溃鲁道源匪第十一兵团部，进而于一日拂晓解放博白，歼灭匪第三兵团部，活捉敌兵团司令张淦。此时匪军混乱不堪，全线崩溃。同时，信宜地区正面解放军奋勇西进，于三十日上午二时解放桂境陆川县城，迅速与解放博白部队会师。然后一路跟踪追击，二十九日至三十日间在陆川西南地区歼敌四十八军一七五师五二三团全部、五二一团一部及敌一二六军三零五师九一三团全部，毙俘敌五二三团团长杨磊以下两千余名。
    张淦兵团原是白匪起家老本，桂系主力，今年十月中旬在衡阳西南五峰山区之役被歼四个师，元气大丧。此次连日又遭我大军穷追，士气低落，甫经接触，敌即丢掉大炮辎重，狼狈西窜。沿路拥挤不堪，在宝墟过河时更争相夺桥，因而挤入河中溺毙者甚多。溃败匪军或肩挑行李，或丢帽弃鞋，一路大肆抢掠，并强卖其武器给居民。经我大军勇猛追击，残匪满山遍野奔跑，小部溃败逃走，大部皆被俘掳，或自行投降。
    当北线白匪南逃时，原在合浦地区的匪第四兵团沈发藻部残匪纠集其二十三、六十三、七十军残部及一零九军三二一师伪粤桂边挺进纵队等于二十九日晚进犯廉江。预伏南线之解放军即以迅速动作从廉江西百里外地区分三路向沈匪腹背猛击，将敌拦腰割成数段。三十日晨，窜据廉江附近的匪军于睡梦中惊醒时，发现已陷重围，仓惶应战。但立被我军打得七零八落，四散溃逃。敌三二一师及伪粤桂边挺进纵队在城西南十里外被干净歼灭，匪“粤桂边剿匪总指挥部”中将司令喻英奇被俘。接着踞守城北、城东敌二十三军残部亦纷纷缴械投降。沈匪后卫六十三军残部见势不好，扭头西窜。我军乘胜追击，二日在廉江县西龙潭墟、公术墟地区将敌六十三军击溃，我军战士们在山谷道旁竞相捕捉俘掳。我军一部则沿粤桂海岸向西挺进，于三日晚解放粤西南滨海重要港口合浦县城，沈匪残部仅兵团部及七十军残匪一部侥幸脱逃。
