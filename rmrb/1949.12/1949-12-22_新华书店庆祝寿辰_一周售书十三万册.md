Xinhua Bookstore Celebrates Birthday
　　130,000 Books Sold in One Week
[Beijing News] To celebrate Marshal Stalin's seventieth birthday, the Xinhua Bookstore has been selling books at reduced prices since the 15th of this month. Book buyers have been very enthusiastic, with a total of more than 130,000 copies sold. Among them, more than 10,000 copies of "A Brief Biography of Stalin" and more than 20,000 copies of Stalin's works were sold. Yesterday (the 21st) was the last day of the price reduction. Before the bookstore even opened in the morning, many people were already waiting outside. Until after 7:00 p.m., the place was crowded all day long. To make it easier for book buyers, the bookstore not only had people line up to buy in order, but also transferred more than 20 staff members from the North China General Store and branch stores to sell at the entrance. The birthday tapestry prepared for signing birthday wishes was filled in an hour. The bookmarks printed with Stalin's photo, prepared for the last day, were also snapped up. The mobile supply team, at the invitation of various universities in the western suburbs, loaded a truck full of books to sell to the western suburbs, but the books were snapped up as soon as they reached Tsinghua and Yanjing Universities.

　　新华书店庆祝寿辰
    一周售书十三万册
    【北京讯】新华书店为庆祝斯大林大元帅的七十寿辰，自本月十五日起减价售书以来，购书者十分踊跃，共约售出十三万余册。其中斯大林传略一万余册，斯大林著作二万余册。昨（二十一）日是减价的最后一天，早晨该书店尚未开始营业时，门外就已有许多人在等着，直至下午七时余，整日拥挤不堪，该店为了买书者方便，除排队按次序购买外，又从华北总店及分店调来二十余工作人员，在门口零售。门口预备的祝寿签名的寿幛，一小时即被签满。最后一天所预备的印有斯大林照片的书签，一时亦被抢买光。流动供应队应西郊各大学的邀请，满载一卡车书籍欲至西郊售卖，但只到清华及燕│两校，书籍即被抢买一空。
