TASS, Moscow, 29th: Pravda recently published a communique regarding the Communist Information Bureau's conference held in Hungary in the latter half of November, and released the resolutions passed by the participants. These resolutions are: a resolution on defending peace and struggling against warmongers; a resolution on the unity of the working class and the tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties; and a resolution entitled "The Yugoslav Communist Party in the Hands of Murderers and Spies."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th. TASS, Moscow, 30th: Pravda's editorial, titled "Striving for Peace, Democracy, and the National Independence of All Peoples," comments on the results of the Communist Information Bureau conference's work. Pravda writes: The Communist Information Bureau's resolutions, published on November 29th, are of utmost importance for the activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and for safeguarding the vital interests of the broad masses of people in all countries. Pravda writes: The decisions made at the Information Bureau conference held in Hungary in the latter half of November 1949 are aimed at mobilizing the broadest masses to fight against the danger of a new war. These decisions arm Communists, the working class, and the working people to fight for peace, democracy, the national independence of all countries, and the vital interests of the working people. These decisions expose the incurable diseases of the imperialist system and the further weakening of imperialism. Pravda emphasizes: The Communist Information Bureau's decisions strengthen the working class's confidence in the inevitable victory of its cause, and demonstrate the growing power of democratic forces fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism under the inspiration of the great Stalin.
