Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th: TASS, Blagoveshchensk, December 26th: The trial of former Japanese army personnel Yamada Otozō, Emets Ryuji, Takahashi Takaatsu, Kawashima Kiyoshi, Nishi Toyohiko, Karasawa Tomio, Onoe Masao, Sato Haruji, Hirazakura Zensaku, Mitomo Katsuo, Kikuchi Norizo, and Tomari Shigeharu, twelve in total, accused of preparing and using bacterial weapons, began at noon local time, with charges established according to Article 1 of the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on April 19, 1943.

The case is being tried by the Primorsky Military Tribunal, composed of presiding judge Major General Judge Chertkov, Judge Advocate Colonel Ilyitsky, and Judge Advocate Lieutenant Colonel Vorobyov. On the state prosecution side, Third-Class State Legal Counsel Smirnov is assisting with the work. The defendants are defended by eight lawyers: Borovik, Belov, Sannikov, Zverev, Bogachev, Prokopenko, Lukyanov, and Pokovitinov.

The audience was full, with workers, staff, scientists, and representatives of the Soviet army from various factories and institutions in Blagoveshchensk attending.

The trial began in the morning with the reading of the indictment. All defendants pleaded guilty to the charges against them in court.

In the afternoon, the court interrogated defendant Kawashima Kiyoshi—one of the direct and active participants in the research, manufacture, and use of bacterial weapons. Kawashima, a trained bacteriologist and medical doctor, led all the most important departments of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army for several years and personally participated in the unit's numerous heinous "research" and "experiments" on batches of living people. In 1941 and 1942, he participated in organizing special expeditions to the Central China battlefield to use bacterial weapons in combat.

Kawashima confessed that Unit 731 was formed in 1936 on the order of Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The defendant said: "As far as we can remember, the Emperor's secret decree issued in 1940 stipulated that Unit 731 should have 3,000 personnel. The vast majority of the unit's personnel were experts—bacteriologists and people with some training in bacteriology. According to the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, the area where the unit was stationed was declared a restricted zone, and even airplanes were not allowed to fly over the area. The Japanese authorities allocated a large amount of funds to maintain Unit 731. In 1940 alone, 10 million yen was allocated, with 5 million yen specifically designated for practical work."

    本案系由滨海军区军事法庭审讯，法庭由审判长少将军法官契尔特科夫、审判员上校军法官伊里伊茨基和审判员中校军法官沃罗比耶夫组成。国家检察机关方面，由第三级国家法律顾问斯米尔诺夫协助工作。被告辩护律师有波罗维克、别洛夫、山尼科夫、兹维列夫、波加切夫、普罗科朋科、鲁克扬杰夫及波柯维蒂诺夫等八人。

    早晨开庭时首先宣读起诉书。各被告对于被控的罪状均当庭服罪。
    下午庭审问被告川岛清——细菌武器的研究、制造和使用的直接积极参与者之一。受过训练的细菌学家、医学博士川岛，曾先后领导日本关东军七三一部队的一切最重要部门达数年之久，并亲自参与该部队对成批活人进行的多次罪恶“研究”和“实验”。在一九四一年和一九四二年，他参与组织特别远征队，赴中国的华中战场使用细菌武器作战。
    川岛供认：七三一部队在一九三六年奉日本天皇裕仁的命令组成的。被告说：“据我们记忆所及，一九四○年颁布的天皇秘令，规定七三一部队的名额为三千人。该部队人员的绝大多数是专家——细菌学家和在细菌学上受过一定训练的人。依照关东军总司令的命令，该部队驻扎的地区被宣布为禁区，甚至飞机都不准飞越该区上空。日本当局拨出大量基金，维持七三一部队。在一九四○年就拨款一千万日元，其中指定用五百万日元作实际工作。”
