Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th: Former Kuomintang Army 119th Deputy Commander Jiang Hancheng (i.e., Jiang Yuntai) led more than 8,000 troops in an uprising in Wudu, southern Gansu, on the 9th of this month. The army commander Wang Zhiqi and Kuomintang Commissioner and Xihuo County Chief Zhang Xiaoyou, Wenxian County Chief Wang Zhemian, Chengxian County Chief Chen Xiu, and acting Wudu County Chief Ma Buyuan simultaneously announced their uprising. Wang, Jiang, and others recently issued a telegram announcing the uprising, stating: Driven by our conscience and integrity, we are unwilling to continue to toil for the remaining privileges of the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandits and the big comprador landlord and bureaucrat class. Therefore, on December 9th, we led our troops in an uprising, resolutely breaking away from the Chiang bandit reactionary clique, wholeheartedly returning to the people, supporting the People's Government, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Peng, and the Northwest military and political leaders, obeying all the systems and orders of the People's Liberation Army, striving to thoroughly eliminate the remaining rule of the Chiang/Hu bandit gang for anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism, and working to realize New Democracy and establish an independent, democratic, free, prosperous, and strong People's Republic of China, even if we exhaust ourselves.

(Editor's note: A portion of the Kuomintang 119th Army was originally stationed in Wudu, Gansu. This was led by Deputy Commander Jiang Yuntai in an uprising when a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army occupied the city on the 9th of this month. This news was already published on page 5 of this newspaper on the 21st.)
