Why Issue Victory Bonds?
    Qian Jiaju
    Since the price fluctuations in November, newspapers and magazines have constantly asked me to write articles about the price issue, and I have also been repeatedly asked about the reasons for the price fluctuations. I have not responded because the basic reason for the price fluctuations is that military operations have not yet ended, military expenditures are still very large, and a considerable part of the deficit finance still relies on currency issuance, leading to currency depreciation and price increases. However, our current economic difficulties are fundamentally different from the Kuomintang government's inflation. We are experiencing difficulties in victory, which are temporary and can be overcome. They cannot be compared with the Kuomintang government's difficulties in failure, a desperate struggle. We have long known that the People's Government has specific measures to tighten currency and stabilize prices, but it is not appropriate to guess arbitrarily before the government makes a formal decision. Therefore, I have always been reluctant to write about the price issue lightly.

    The issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds and the 1950 revenue and expenditure budget案, approved by the Central People's Government on December 2, are important measures to tighten currency issuance and stabilize prices, and also a trump card to ensure that we achieve victory and overcome current economic difficulties. Issuing banknotes and issuing bonds are both just pieces of paper, but their effects are exactly opposite. The former can inflate currency and cause price increases, while the latter can tighten currency and achieve price stability. Why must we issue bonds today? The fact is obvious: military expenditures cannot be saved today. Without the victory of the People's Liberation Army, we cannot build a new China. This is certain. Today, we need to support 7 million people, and it is estimated that next year we will need to support 9 million people who are detached from production. Taking all the old army and old public employees together, reforming them, and giving them a way out of life to prevent them from committing crimes and causing social unrest is a very correct principle, so military and administrative expenses cannot be saved. In addition, investments in state-owned enterprises and cultural, educational, and health expenses cannot be reduced. Investments in state-owned enterprises account for 23.9% of next year's total expenditure, and cultural and educational expenses (excluding the living expenses of educators) account for 4.1%. Without investments in state-owned enterprises (including farmland water conservancy, railway repairs, etc.), it would be impossible to restore the war-torn economy, that is, it would be impossible to improve our national economic productivity. Cultural and educational expenses only account for slightly more than 4%, which cannot be reduced. On the income side, agricultural tax accounts for 41% of total income. The average burden on farmers accounts for about 20% of their total income, not including war service burdens. The burden on farmers cannot be increased further! Industrial and commercial tax revenue accounts for 38.9% of total revenue. Although this proportion is not large, many of the tax revenues will be passed on to farmers because the major cities have not been liberated for long, and industry and commerce have not yet recovered. Since expenditures cannot be reduced and income cannot be increased significantly, the existence of deficit finance is inevitable. How to make up for this deficit? One way is to continue the current method of issuing currency, allowing prices to jump like a malaria attack every three or four months, making the 470 million compatriots across the country suffer from the impact of price fluctuations; the other way is to issue a batch of bonds, making a large recall of the issued currency, so that although industrialists, businessmen, and wealthy households (the main targets for promoting bonds) temporarily freeze their floating capital, it can allow us to get through the difficult year of 1950 and give us a breathing time to strive for the improvement of the financial and price situation. Which of these two methods is better? Undoubtedly, issuing bonds is ten thousand times better than continuing inflation. All patriotic people will support this bond issuance plan.

    The total amount of bonds issued this time is 200 million shares, each share being one indexed unit, calculated based on the wholesale price of six catties of rice (millet in Tianjin), one and a half catties of flour, four feet of white cloth, and sixteen catties of coal in the six major cities of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. When repaying principal and interest in the future, it will also be repaid on an indexed basis, so there is no loss for those who buy bonds. Not only is there no loss, but it is also like an indexed savings deposit, guaranteeing principal and interest, and recovering both principal and interest within five years. Buying bonds is just temporarily freezing his funds, which is no different from an indexed savings deposit. The only difference is that the funds for buying bonds need to be frozen for one to five years, while indexed savings deposits only need to be frozen for three to six months. However, due to the bond purchase war, on the one hand, the government can reduce the issuance of banknotes, and on the other hand, the activities of floating capital in the market are reduced. This not only provides significant help in supplementing the country's deficit finance but also plays an important role in stabilizing prices.

    The main targets for issuing bonds should be, first, industrialists and businessmen in newly liberated cities, second, landlords and rich peasants in areas where land reform has not been implemented, and third, absentee landlords and wealthy households with floating capital in hand. For industrialists and businessmen, the principle should naturally be to not hinder the reproduction of their capital. If some industrial sectors are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and encounter production difficulties, the government can also provide production loans and other conveniences. Therefore, promoting bonds will never affect production enterprises. On the contrary, after prices reach a considerable level of stability, it is absolutely beneficial to production enterprises. As for landlords and rich peasants in areas where land reform has not been implemented and absentee landlords and wealthy households with floating capital in hand, we really should ask them to bear more. For them, buying bonds on the one hand helps the government overcome financial difficulties, and on the other hand enables them to preserve the value of their currency, benefiting both themselves and others. Why not do it? As for rural areas where land reform has been implemented, the principle should be free solicitation. We should not place our hopes on them.

    The issuance of these People's Victory Bonds will surely be supported by the people of the whole country. At the same time, given the success of the issuance of indexed bonds in the Northeast, we can also assert that this bond issuance will definitely be successfully completed. The Northeast issued an indexed bond this year. The first phase issued 600 billion (Northeast currency), and the result was that sales exceeded the quota, with actual receipts of 700 billion. This shows how enthusiastically the people of the Northeast support the issuance of bonds. Although the issuance of currency in the Northeast in 1949 increased significantly, prices only rose by 80% this year. The basic reason, of course, is that the war has ended throughout the Northeast and the correct leadership of the Northeast People's Government in financial work, but the timely issuance of bonds is also a major factor. This time, the total number of victory bonds is 200 million shares. When converted according to the pre-war currency value and population ratio, it is really not a large number. The Northeast was able to achieve results that exceeded the issuance quota. Why can't we do it in Guannei? The Northeast has had such price stability within a year of the end of the war. Similarly, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, what reason is there to say that it cannot be done in the whole of China? We should all have this confidence. We want to guarantee the improvement of the financial and economic situation in 1950. We want to guarantee the 100% realization of the 1950 budget. First of all, we should strive to promote the sale of victory bonds. Of course, this does not mean that after issuing bonds, we will have no financial deficit, as Director Chen Yun pointed out, "Even if bonds are issued and the financial deficit for next year is reduced, the financial situation for next year will still be difficult." Therefore, in addition to striving to ensure the realization of the bond issuance plan, we must also implement streamlining and savings, careful planning, reduce waste, and ensure income. Not only do military, government, public, and educational personnel have this responsibility, but all of us also have this responsibility.

　　为什么要发行胜利公债？
    千家驹
    自从十一月份物价起了大波动以后，不断地有报纸和刊物要我写点关于物价问题的文章，也不断地遇到有人问起我物价波动的原因何在？我一直都没有答复，原因很简单，就是物价波动的基本原因是今天军事行动还没有结束，军事支出仍很庞大，赤字财政相当大的一部分还是要依赖通货发行，以致币值下跌，物价上涨。但是今天我们的经济困难与国民党政府的通货膨胀基本上是不同的，我们是胜利中的困难，暂时性的，有办法可以克服的，它与国民党政府之失败中的困难，绝望中的挣扎，根本不能相提并论。我们早就知道人民政府对于紧缩通货，平稳物价是有具体办法的，但在政府未作正式决定以前，是不便任意猜测的。因此，对物价问题我一直不敢轻于下笔。
    十二月二日中央人民政府所通过的发行人民胜利折实公债与一九五○年度收支概算案，便是紧缩通货发行，稳定物价一个重要的措施，也是保障我们达到胜利克服当前经济困难的一张王牌。发行钞票与发行公债，虽然同是一张纸，但其作用恰恰相反，前者可以膨胀通货，造成物价上涨，后者可以紧缩通货，达到物价稳定。今天我们为什么非发行公债不可呢？事实很明显，军费支出今天是不能省的，没有人民解放军的胜利就不能建设新中国，这一条是肯定了的。现在我们要养活七百万人，估计到明年要养活脱离生产人员九百万人。把所有旧军队旧公教人员一齐包下来，加以改造，给以生活的出路，免得他们在地方上为非作歹，引起社会骚乱，这一原则，是非常正确的，所以军事费与行政费都无可节省。此外，国营企业投资与文化教育卫生费亦是不能减省的，国营事业投资占明年总支出百分之二三．九，文化教育费（教育人员生活费不在内）占百分之四．一，没有国营事业投资（包括农田水利，铁道修理等等），就不可能恢复战后残破的经济，即不可能使我们国民经济生产力提高一步。文化教育费仅占百分之四强，那更不能减少。在收入方面，农业税占总收入百分之四十一，农民的负担平均要占其总收入百分之二十左右，战勤负担还不在内，农民负担是不能要求再增加的了！工商业税收占全部收入百分之三八．九，这比例虽不算大，但因为今天各大城市解放不久，工商业还没有恢复，况且税收中有许多都要转嫁到农民身上的。支出既不能减少，收入又不能大量增加，赤字财政的存在是必然的。如何弥补这种赤字呢？一种就是继续目前的发行通货办法，让物价过三四个月来一次疟疾性的跳跃，使全国四万万七千万同胞忍受这种物价波动的影响；一种就是发行一笔公债，把发出去的通货来一次大回笼，这样虽使工商业者与富户（推销公债的主要对象）把他们的游资暂时冻结起来，但可以使我们渡过了一九五○年的难关，使我们可以有一个喘息时间来争取财政与物价状况的好转。这两种办法究竟那一种好呢？无疑地发行公债是比继续通货膨胀好过万倍的，所有的爱国人民都会拥护这一公债发行计划的。
    这次发行的公债总额是二万万分，每分为一折实单位，以上海、汉口、天津、西安、广州、重庆六大城市之大米（天津为小米）六斤，面粉一斤半，白细布四尺，煤炭十六斤之批发价总和计算之。将来还本付息时亦以折实偿还，所以这对购买公债的人是毫无损失的，不但没有损失，而且等于折实储蓄存款一样，保本保息，在五年之内，连本带利都收回来。买公债不过把他的资金暂时冻结一下，与折实储蓄存款没有什么不同，所不同的仅是买公债的资金要冻结一年至五年之久，而折实储蓄存款只要冻结三个月至六个月罢了。但由于购买公债之战，一方面可以使政府减少钞票的发行，另方面又使市场上减少了游资的活动，这不仅对国家的赤字财政弥补上有重大的帮助，而且对于物价安定上也会起重要的作用。
    发行公债的主要对象，第一应该是新解放都市的工商业家，第二应该是未实行土改地区的地主富农，第三应该是有游资在手的寓公富户们。对于工商业家，自然应该以不妨碍他们资金的再生产为原则，有些工业部门，如果对国计民生有利的，生产困难时，政府还可予以生产贷款及其他种种便利。所以推销公债决不会影响生产事业。相反的，物价达到相当安定之后，对生产事业是绝对有利的。至于未实行土革的地主富农，和有游资在手的寓公富户们，我们实在应该叫他们多多负担一些。对他们说，购买公债一方面是帮了政府克服财政困难，另方面是使自己能保全币值，利己利人，亦何乐不为。至于已实行土革的农村，则应以自由劝募为原则，我们不应该把希望寄托在他们上面。
    对于这次人民胜利公债的发行，一定会取得全国人民之拥护的，同时鉴于东北发行折实公债的成功，我们也可以断言这回公债发行一定可以顺利完成。东北今年发行了一次折实公债，第一期发行六千亿（东北券），结果推销超过了定额，实收七千亿，这可以看出东北人民对发行公债，是如何热诚地拥护。东北一九四九年通货发行虽有大量增加，而物价在今年内仅仅上涨百分之八十，这基本的原因当然是因为战争在全东北境内已经结束，以及东北人民政府财政工作领导的正确，但公债之合时发行也是一个重大的因素。这一次胜利公债总数为二万万分，以战前币值与人口比例来折算起来，实在是一个并不算大的数目，东北能够做到了超出发行定额的成绩，为什么我们关内不能呢？东北在结束了战争一年之内，物价便有这样的稳定，同样在中国共产党毛主席领导之下，有什么理由说在全中国会做不到呢？这一点我们大家都应该有这个信心，我们要保证一九五○年财政与经济局面之好转，我们要保证一九五○年概算之百分之百的实现，首先我们就应该为推销胜利公债而努力。自然这里并不是说，发行公债之后，我们便没有财政赤字，正如陈云主任所指出“即使发行了公债，缩小了明年财政赤字以后，明年的财政情况，仍是困难的。”因此，除了努力保证公债发行计划之实现外，我们还必须实行精简节约，精打细算，减少浪费，保证收入，这不仅军政公教人员有责任，我们全体人民也同样有此责任。
