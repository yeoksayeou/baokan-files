Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 3rd: In order to restore and develop tea production and export, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council approved a concrete plan for managing tea in 1950 on November 18th. This plan was jointly drafted by the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture. The two ministries jointly convened the National Tea Conference from October 25th to November 6th, attended by relevant leaders and tea industry experts from the major administrative regions of East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Central China, and tea-producing provinces. The conference formulated specific plans for the guiding principles, organizational structure of management institutions, and budget for managing tea next year. The main contents of the plan are as follows:

Regarding the management principles for next year: 1. In terms of crude tea production: In order to meet export requirements, we should actively expand the production of export black tea, green tea, and brick tea next year. Special support and promotion should be given to areas that used to mainly produce black tea but have now declined, so as to restore production. In addition, the purchase price of crude tea must guarantee the production cost of tea farmers to encourage them to increase production. 2. In terms of processing: We should strive to develop the machine-made tea industry, as this is the main method to reduce costs, compete in the international market, guarantee the price of crude tea, and encourage tea farmers to produce. Therefore, it is decided to establish state-owned machine-made tea factories in black tea areas and some green tea areas. The average annual output of each factory should be 10,000 dan of refined tea. Twenty such tea factories will be established in 1950. At the same time, private individuals are allowed to set up factories, and private individuals are helped and encouraged to switch to machine-made tea. For the hand-made tea industry, we will neither interfere nor encourage it, but adopt the policy of developing state-owned and private machine processing industries in order to replace handicrafts. 3. In terms of trade: Expand sales to the Soviet Union, with all sales to the Soviet Union being managed by the state; maintain and expand sales to Africa, with both the state and private individuals allowed to manage; domestic sales will still be mainly private, with the state able to adjust the market when necessary; abolish the past border sales licensing system and allow private individuals to operate freely, but because border sales are related to the policies towards ethnic minorities and involve a large amount of capital accumulation, and the strength of private individuals is limited, state-owned commerce should vigorously operate; overseas sales are related to foreign exchange and overseas Chinese business, and private operation should still be encouraged and supported.

Regarding organizational leadership: Under the joint leadership of the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the state-owned China Tea Company will be established to uniformly handle the acquisition, processing, research, and improvement of state-owned tea. The company can also handle tea exports and barter trade under the management of the Ministry of Trade. China Tea Company is one of the state-owned national professional companies, with the head office located in Beijing, branch offices established in major tea distribution cities, and processing factories established in major tea production areas. The company will be led vertically from top to bottom, with unified allocation of funds and cadres. The original tea companies and processing factories in various places will be reorganized as components of the company. The original tea research and experiment institutions in the central and provincial levels will also be temporarily taken over by the company in order to closely coordinate with business work.

In addition to approving the above plan, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government also ordered the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture to quickly organize the China Tea Company, immediately order machinery and equipment, prepare to build factories, issue tea loans, and prepare the materials needed for the acquisition of crude tea and fertilizers. The Financial and Economic Committee also ordered that the funds originally allocated to the East China and Central China regions for the purchase of tea and the tea already purchased by the two regions be transferred to the China Tea Company.

The Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture have appointed Wu Juenong, the current Deputy Minister of Agriculture and tea expert, to be responsible for the preparation of the head office of the China Tea Company. The preparatory office of the head office has now begun work.

　　恢复发展茶叶产制外销
  　全国茶叶会议制定明年茶业经营计划
    成立中国茶叶公司统一收购及外销
    【新华社北京三日电】为了恢复与发展茶叶的产制与外销，政务院财政经济委员会于十一月十八日批准了一项一九五○年经营茶叶的具体计划，这项计划是贸易部和农业部联合拟制的。两部曾于十月二十五日至十一月六日联合召开全国茶叶会议，出席的有华东、东北、西北、华中各大行政区及产茶省份的有关负责人与茶业专家。会议对明年经营茶叶的方针、经营机构之组织、资金预算等项作出了具体的计划。计划的主要内容如下：
    关于明年经营方针：一、在毛茶生产方面：为了适应外销要求，明年应积极扩大外销红绿茶及砖茶的生产，选择过去主要生产红茶而现在业已衰落的区域特别予以扶植提倡，俾能恢复生产。此外，毛茶收购价格必须保证茶农的生产成本，以鼓励茶农增加生产。二、在加工方面：努力发展机器制茶事业，因为这是减低成本，争取国际市场，和保障毛茶价格，鼓励茶农生产的主要方法。因此决定在红茶区和部分绿茶区设立国营机器制茶厂，每厂全年产量平均以一万担精茶为标准。一九五○年内将成立这种茶厂二十所。同时准许私人设厂，并帮助与鼓励私人改用机器制茶。对手工制茶业，则既不干涉也不鼓励，而采取发展国营与私营的机器加工事业，以期代替手工业的方针。三、在贸易方面：扩大对苏联之销售，苏销全部由国家经营；维持并扩大对非洲的销售，国家与私人均得经营；内销仍以私营为主，国家在必要时可以调剂市场；取消过去边销的引岸制度，准许私人自由经营，但因边销有关对少数民族的政策，而且积压资本甚大，私人力量有限，故国营商业应大力经营；侨销有关外汇和海外侨胞营业，仍须奖励并扶助私人经营。
    关于组织领导：在中央人民政府贸易部与农业部共同领导下，成立国营中国茶叶公司，统一办理国营茶叶的收购、加工，和研究改良等事项，该公司并得在贸易部管理下自行办理茶叶出口及易货。中国茶叶公司为国营的全国性专业公司之一，总公司设于北京，在主要的茶叶集散城市设立分公司，并在主要的茶叶产制地区设立加工工厂。该公司由上而下垂直领导，统一调度资金和干部。各地原有的茶叶公司和加工工厂，都改组为该公司的组成部分。中央及各省原有茶叶研究试验机构，也暂时都由该公司接管，以便与业务工作密切配合。
    中央人民政府财经委员会除批准上述计划外，并令贸易、农业两部迅速筹组中国茶叶公司，并即定购机器和设备，筹备建立工厂，发放茶叶贷款，和筹办收购毛茶和肥料所需的物资。财经委员会又下令将该委会原来拨给华东、华中两地区收购茶叶的资金和该两地区已经购得的茶叶，一并移交中国茶叶公司。
    贸易农业两部已指派现任农业部副部长、茶叶专家吴觉农负责筹组中国茶业公司总公司。该总公司筹备处现已开始工作。
