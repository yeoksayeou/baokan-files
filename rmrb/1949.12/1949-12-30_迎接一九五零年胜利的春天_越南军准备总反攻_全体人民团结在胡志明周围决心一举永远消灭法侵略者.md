Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: The Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, reports: On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Vietnamese people's national liberation war against French imperialism, the Vietnam Information Office published a lengthy communique entitled "December 19, 1946." The following is an abstract of the communique:

On December 19, 1946, the French aggressors launched an all-out offensive, expecting this offensive to bring our newborn republic to its knees. However, three years have passed, and the French "blitzkrieg" has not only failed to achieve its goal but has instead turned into a "blitz retreat." December 19th is a day of commemoration in Vietnamese history. Three years ago, France launched an offensive; today, they are confined to a corner, adopting a defensive posture, while our army is confidently preparing for a counter-offensive. This counter-offensive will eliminate the remaining forces of French imperialism in Vietnam.

Vietnamese Army Strengthened Tens of Times Over in Three Years of Liberation War

Since 1946, the Vietnamese army has greatly developed. Its personnel have increased dozens of times. It has shifted from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare, from eliminating small strongholds to liberating large cities, from attacking scattered enemy patrols to annihilating motorcades of hundreds of vehicles at once. The equipment of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army has been greatly improved. Most of the armaments are manufactured by ourselves, and the rest are seized from the French. Two years ago, Vietnamese troops could not even stay quietly in a village in southern Vietnam for a few days, but today they have been able to establish arsenals. Our arsenals are now capable of manufacturing the most modern weapons, and the quantity is increasing daily. These weapons range from rocket launchers and 70-mm mortars to medium-sized rockets and other weapons. The reason why the Vietnamese people have been able to successfully resist French imperialism is precisely because of such a strong regular army, an increasingly powerful guerrilla force, tens of thousands of young people ready to fight, and the support of a conscious people closely united around the true democratic government.

Another reason for the victory is the deep-rooted patriotism of the people, who know how to sacrifice their immediate interests to realize their long-term and paramount aspirations. One example of this patriotism is the movement of the people selling rice to the army at low prices. The whole of North Vietnam responded to President Ho Chi Minh's call with great enthusiasm and realized this movement. Vietnamese workers and peasants transported weapons and food for the army along the Cao Bang-Lang Son highway, working for millions of hours. This mass support and assistance made a huge contribution to our defeat of the enemy and the achievement of multiple victories in this area.

The French imperialists blindly and arrogantly dreamed of conquering our government and army by force alone and reimposing colonial rule upon us. However, the Napoleonic disaster and other setbacks on the soil of North Vietnam have taught these complacent imperialists a historically significant lesson, which is that they can never conquer a government and army of a nation determined to fight for freedom.

At the same time, the prestige of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam is increasing day by day, and the people of the whole of Vietnam, with the exception of a small handful of traitors, support it. Disputes and contradictions have arisen within the ranks of the traitors. Their parties are vying with each other for the distribution of positions and privileges. The high commissioners and generals of French imperialism are being replaced and dismissed one after another, like changing shirts.

　　迎接一九五零年胜利的春天
　  越南军准备总反攻
    全体人民团结在胡志明周围决心一举永远消灭法侵略者
    【新华社北京二十九日电】越南通讯社北越讯：越南新闻处于越南人民反对法帝国主义的民族解放战争三周年之际，发表题为“一九四六年十二月十九日”的长篇公报，该公报的摘要如下：
    一九四六年十二月十九日，法国侵略者发动了一个全面攻势，他们预期这个攻势会使我们新生的共和国屈膝，但是，到现在已经过去了三年，法国的“闪击战”，不但没有结果，反而在实行“闪击退却”了。十二月十九日是越南历史上的纪念日。三年以前，法国发动攻势，今天，他们局促一隅，采取守势，而我们的军队正充满自信地准备着反攻，这个反攻，这个反攻将肃清法帝国主义在越南的残余力量。
    三年解放战争中越军状大数十倍
    自一九四六年以来，越南军队有了很大的发展，它的人员已增加了几十倍，它已经从游击战转到了运动战，从消灭小据点转到解放大城市，从袭击敌人零星的巡逻队转到一举歼灭成百辆的汽车队。越南人民解放军的装备已大大改善，大部分武装由我们自己制造，其余的则缴自法国人。两年以前，越南的部队甚至不能在越南南部的一个村庄里安安静静地住上几天，而今天已能建立起兵工厂。我们的兵工厂已能制造最新式的武器，数量也日渐增加。这些武器从火箭炮，七十＠的迫击炮一直到中等大小的火箭及其他武器。越南人民之所以能胜利地抵抗法帝国主义，正是因为有了这样一支强有力的正规军，有着日益强大的游击队，数以万计的准备战斗的青年，以及亲密地团结在真正的民主政府周围的自觉的人民的支持。
    另一个胜利的原因，是人民的根深蒂固的爱国主义，他们知道怎样牺牲他们的眼前利益，以实现他们的长远的和高于一切的愿望。这种爱国主义的例子之一，是人民贱价售米给军队的运动，整个北越以极大的热情响应胡志明主席的号召，实现了这个运动。越南的工人、农民为高平——谅山公路沿线的军队输送武器和粮食，工作的时间达数百万小时，这种群众性的支持与帮助，对我们在这块地区击败敌人和获得多次胜利是有巨大贡献的。
    法帝国主义者曾盲目而狂妄地梦想单凭武力征服我们的政府和军队，把殖民地统治再加于我们头上。但是，他们在北越土地上的拿破仑式的灾难和其他的挫败，已给这群自骄自满的帝国主义者上了有历史意义的一课，这就是说，他们永远不能征服一个有决心争取自由的国家的政府和军队。
    与此同时，越南共和国政府的威望一天天地提高了，除了一小撮卖国贼外，全越南的人民都拥护它。卖国贼的阵营里则发生了争执和矛盾。他们党因为分配职位和特权互相倾轧。法帝国主义的高级专员和将军们，则象换衬衣一样一个接着一个地更换和撤职。
