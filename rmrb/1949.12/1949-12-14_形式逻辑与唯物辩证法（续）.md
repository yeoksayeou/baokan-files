　　Formal Logic and Materialist Dialectics (Continued)
    By Strogovich
    Translated by Cao Baohua and Xie Ning
    "We strive for the withering away of the state. At the same time, we strive to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is the most powerful and strongest of all state powers to date. The highest development of state power aims to prepare the various conditions for the withering away of state power—this is the Marxist formula. Is this 'contradictory'? Yes, it is 'contradictory'. But this contradiction is a living contradiction, which entirely reflects Marx's dialectics."

    That is to say, the dialectical contradiction is like this here: the socialist state is strengthening, and this strengthening is the condition for its future withering away. To establish this principle, one must perfectly grasp dialectics. Anyone who thinks only in terms of formal logic (either—or, is—not) will not reach such a truth; he will probably deduce: "If the state is strengthened, it means it will not wither away; and if it will wither away, it means it has not been strengthened, but weakened."

    However, this dialectical contradiction in the development of the socialist state is determined in this way and is determined with the help of the dialectical method. If we examine whether this contradiction excludes the role of the laws of formal logic, we see that it does not at all: the above-mentioned principle of dialectics affirms the living contradictions in the development of social phenomena, but does not allow any contradictions in the process of thinking and in logical argumentation. The socialist state is strengthening now in order to wither away later (when the necessary conditions arrive). This is completely in accordance with the requirements of the law of contradiction; according to the law of contradiction, contradictory attributes cannot be attributed to an object at the same time and in the same relationship. In the current case, the attribution of some contradictory attributes (strengthening and disappearing) to the socialist state is not at the same time, but at different stages of development and under different conditions. There is no violation of the laws of formal logic here.

    Let's take another example to illustrate the relationship between formal logic and dialectics. Comrade Stalin wrote in the article "How Does Social Democracy Understand the National Question?":

    "I am reminded of the Russian metaphysicians of the 1850s, who stubbornly asked the dialecticians of the time whether rain was beneficial or harmful to the harvest, demanding that they give a 'categorical' answer. The dialecticians readily proved that posing the question in this way was completely unscientific, that rain was beneficial in times of drought, but useless and even harmful in times of rain, and that it was therefore obviously foolish to demand a 'categorical' answer to such a question." (XI)

    Metaphysicians think only in terms of formal logic, and therefore ask whether rain is generally beneficial or harmful. Dialecticians reject such a way of posing the question, considering it unscientific and unreasonable: under some conditions rain is beneficial, and under other conditions it is useless and even harmful. Only by thinking dialectically is it possible to correctly pose and solve this problem. However, posing and solving this problem dialectically does not contradict the requirements of formal logic in the slightest, and the solution obtained in this way is also correct from the point of view of formal logic. In fact, rain is beneficial and useless under different conditions, but under the same conditions it is either beneficial or useless. In times of drought, rain is beneficial and precisely beneficial (law of identity), and under these conditions it cannot be considered useless (law of contradiction). In these two judgments—rain is beneficial in times of drought and rain is useless—the first judgment is true and the second judgment is false (law of excluded middle). In times of drought, rain is beneficial because it moistens the dry land, protects the sowing, and enables the seeds to grow (law of sufficient reason). If someone says: rain is beneficial and useless in times of drought, this violates the laws of formal logic, and from the point of view of dialectics this is also unreasonable.

    Summarizing the above points, the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics can be expressed as follows:

    (1) Formal logic is a science different from dialectical logic, and it is a lower stage of cognition for dialectical logic.

    (2) The laws of formal logic are a necessary condition for human thought; at the lower stage of cognition, within the scope of ordinary, simplest relationships, things, objects, and phenomena, these laws are sufficient to achieve the purpose of cognition.

    (3) At the higher stage of cognition, when studying reality from the entire richness of reality and from the entire complexity and contradictoriness of its development, the laws of formal logic are insufficient, and dialectics must be applied, and the laws of dialectical logic must be followed; but even within this scope, dialectical thinking does not exclude the laws of formal logic, but preserves the laws of formal logic, using them as its necessary, but not unique, not main, but only preliminary conditions.

    "Revision" of Formal Logic

    Formal logic is a necessary element of education and training; studying formal logic is important for every scientific worker and practical worker.

    Lenin once pointed out: formal logic must be studied "with revision" (XII). That is to say, it should not be studied according to the style it has in bourgeois logic works and in bourgeois formal logic textbooks.

    Why is it only necessary to revise the already formed formal logic, and not to need a new and different formal logic? As has been pointed out in this chapter: the laws of formal logic are the generalization and reflection in people's consciousness of the practice that people have repeated countless times over many centuries; this is the attribute of thought, which is adapted to the simplest basic necessity of the objects and phenomena of objective reality. Therefore, formal logic is not fabricated by people, it exists; its laws are effective even for a person who does not regard formal logic as a science at all. These laws must be studied. Therefore, it is not necessary to establish a "new" formal logic, but to establish the formal logic that exists in life and practice, and to liberate formal logic from the idealistic distortions and misinterpretations that were brought into formal logic by scholastic philosophy in the Middle Ages and by bourgeois scholars in modern times.

    Bourgeois philosophers have always tried to abandon "classical" formal logic and establish a new formal logic. They argued that "Aristotle's" logic was outdated and no longer suitable for the new needs and achievements of science. Therefore, they abandoned or belittled the laws of formal logic that had penetrated into people's consciousness and were confirmed by people's daily practical life experience. They fabricated some new formulas of thinking and new forms that had lost their content and were separated from practice. This path is the path of transforming formal logic into formalistic logic.

    Our attitude towards formal logic is completely different: what the development of science and the revolution sparked by Marxism in science cause at every step is not the need to replace one formal logic with another, but the need for dialectics and the need for the dialectical method. Formal logic remains in its place. But it is not enough to simply liberate formal logic from idealistic distortions and misinterpretations.

    The laws of logic must be studied from the Marxist materialist standpoint, and the science of formal logic must be developed and advanced.

    According to Lenin's instructions, what revisions should be made to formal logic?

    These revisions are:

    (1) Formal logic should be regarded as the science of the simplest necessary attributes of thought; therefore, any attempt to regard formal logic as the unique and all-encompassing science of the method of cognition should be rejected, that is, its position in relation to materialist dialectics should be determined.

    (2) Formal logic and the scientific exploration of its problems must be carried out from a materialist standpoint, and formal logic must be liberated from the idealistic distortions imposed on it by medieval scholastic philosophers and bourgeois scholars. Its laws should be regarded as the reflection of the objective attributes and relationships of reality in people's consciousness.

    (3) Formal logic should be regarded as a means of recognizing reality, not as a purposeless game of logical forms. Therefore, everything that is useless and artificial and everything that cannot be confirmed by the requirements of life, science, and practice should be excluded from formal logic.

    (4) When studying or teaching formal logic, it should be based on materials that are realistic from the point of view of the Soviet people, and should be based on the materials of Soviet reality and Soviet life. This material should show that formal logic is a means (not the only one, not the main one, but an important one) of solving the realistic tasks of Soviet science and practice and of exposing and refuting hostile bourgeois views and concepts.

    This is the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics. It is necessary to briefly examine this issue in order to determine the position of the laws of formal logic in the knowledge of reality and in the expression and development of our thoughts reflecting objective reality.

　　形式逻辑与唯物辩证法（续）
    斯特罗果维契  作
    曹葆华、谢宁译
    “我们争取国家底衰亡。我们同时又争取加强无产阶级专政，无产阶级专政是到现在为止的一切国家政权中最有力量和最强大的政权。国家政权底最高发展，其目的便是准备国家政权衰亡的各种条件——这就是马克思主义的公式。这是‘矛盾的’吗？是的，是‘矛盾的’。但这矛盾是活生生的矛盾，它整个地反映着马克思的辩证法”。
    这就是说，辩证的矛盾在这里就是如此；社会主义国家在加强着，而这种加强又是它将来衰亡的条件。要确立这一原理，必须完善地掌握辩证法。谁要是仅仅形式逻辑地（或者——或者，是——不是）去思考，他就不会达到这样的真理，他大概会这样地推断：“如果国家加强了，这就是说它不会衰亡；而如果它会衰亡，这就是说它没有加强，而是削弱了”。
    但是，社会主义国家发展中的这种辩证的矛盾就是这样确定的，并且是借助于辩证方法而确定的。如果考察一下这种矛盾是否排除形式逻辑规律底作用，那么我们看出是一点也不的：上述的辩证法原理肯定社会现象发展中的活生生的矛盾，但是不容许思想进程中和逻辑论证中的任何矛盾。社会主义国家现在加强着，以便后来（当必要的条件到来的时候）衰亡。这里是完全合乎矛盾律底要求的；根据矛盾律，在同一时间和同一关系上不能把一些矛盾的属性归诸于一个对象。在当前的场合下，一些矛盾的属性（加强和消亡）之归诸于社会主义国家，并不是在同一时间内，而是在不同的发展阶段上、在不同的条件下。这里一点也没有违反形式逻辑底规律。
    再举一个例子来说明形式逻辑与辩证法底相互关系。斯大林同志在“社会民主党是如何理解民族问题的？”一文中写道：
    “我想起十九世纪五○年代的俄国形而上学家，他们执拗地向当时的辩证家询问雨对于收获是有益的还是有害的，要求他们给一个‘斩钉截铁的’答案。辩证家们毫不困难地证明了这样提出问题是完全不科学的，在天旱的时候雨是有益的，而在多雨的时候却是无益而且甚至有害的，因此，要求对这种问题给一个‘斩钉截铁的’答案，是显然的愚蠢”。（十一）
    形而上学家仅仅是形式逻辑地思考着，因此提出了雨一般地是有益或无益的问题。辩证家摈斥这样地提出问题，认为这是不科学的、不合理的：在一些条件下雨是有益的，在另一些条件下却是无益而且甚至有害的。只有辩证地思考，才可能正确地提出和解决这个问题。但是辩证地提出这个问题并解决这个问题，丝毫也没有和形式逻辑底要求相矛盾，而且这样获得的解决从形式逻辑方面看来也是正确的。实际上，在不同的条件下雨是有益的也是无益的，但是在相同的条件下它就或者是有益的，或者是无益的。在天旱的时候雨是有益的而且恰好是有益的（同一律），在这种条件下它不能认为是无益的（矛盾律），在这两个判断——在天旱的时候雨是有益的和雨是无益的——之中，第一个判断是真的，第二个判断是假的（排中律），在天旱的时候雨是有益的，因为它润湿干燥的土地，保护播种并使种子能生长起来（充足理由律）。如果有人说：在天旱的时候雨是有益的也是无益，这就违反了形式逻辑底规律，而从辩证法底观点看来这也是不合理的。
    总结上述各点，形式逻辑和唯物辩证法底相互关系可以表述如下：
    （一）形式逻辑是与辩证逻辑不同的科学，它对于辩证逻辑乃是低级的认识阶段。
    （二）形式逻辑底规律乃是人的思想底必要条件；在低级的认识阶段上，在寻常的、最简单的关系、事物、对象和现象底范围内，这些规律是足以达到认识底目的的。
    （三）在高级的认识阶段上，在从现实底全部丰富性、从其发展底全部复杂性和矛盾性来研究现实的时候，形式逻辑底规律是不足够的，而必须应用辩证法，必须遵循辩证逻辑底规律；但是就在这个范围内辩证思维也不排除形式逻辑底规律，而是保存形式逻辑底规律，把它们作为自己必要的、但不是唯一的也不是主要的、而只是初步的条件。
    对形式逻辑的“修正”
    形式逻辑乃是教育底必要因素，学习的训练；研究形式逻辑对于每个科学工作者和实际工作者都是重要的。
    列宁曾经指出：必须“修正地”（十二）研究形式逻辑。这就是说，应当不是按照它在资产阶级逻辑著作中、在资产阶级形式逻辑教本中所具有的样式去研究它。
    为什么只须对已形成的形式逻辑加以修正，而不需要新的另外的形式逻辑呢？本章中已经指出：形式逻辑底规律乃是人在许多世纪以来重复过无数次的实践在人们意识中的概括和反映；这是思想底属性，与客观现实之对象和现象底最简单的基本必性相适应。因此，形式逻辑不是人们臆造出来的，它是存在着的；它的规律甚至对于一个丝毫不把形式逻辑看作科学的人也是有作用的。这些规律是必须研究的。因此，并不需要建立“新的”形式逻辑，而是需要建立存在于生活和实践中的形式逻辑，需要把形式逻辑从唯心论的歪曲和曲解中解放出来，而把这些歪曲和曲解带入形式逻辑中的，在中世纪是经院哲学，在近代则是资产阶级学者们。
    资产阶级哲学家们始终企图抛弃“古典的”形式逻辑，建立新的形式逻辑。他们借口说“亚里士多德的”逻辑已经陈腐，已经不适合于科学底新的需要和成绩，于是摒弃或贬低那已渗入人民意识中并由人们日常的实际生活经验所证实的形式逻辑底规律，捏造出一些新的思维公式，捏造出一些失掉了内容并和实践分离的新形式。这一条道路是把形式逻辑转化为形式主义逻辑的道路。
    我们对形式逻辑的态度是完全不同的：科学发展以及马克思主义在科学中掀起的革命在每一步骤上所引起的，不是需要以一种形式逻辑代替另一种形式逻辑，而是需要辩证法，需要辩证方法。形式逻辑则停留在自己的地位上。但是仅仅把形式逻辑从唯心论的歪曲和曲解中解放出来是不够的。
    必须从马克思主义的唯物论立场来研究逻辑底规律，把形式逻辑这一科学加以发展和推进。
    根据列宁底指示，形式逻辑应当有哪些修正呢？
    这些修正是：
    （一）形式逻辑应当看作是关于思想底最简单的必要属性的科学；因此，应当摈斥把形式逻辑看作关于认识方法的唯一的和无所不包的科学的任何企图，即是，应当确定它对于唯物辩证法的地位。
    （二）必须从唯物论的立场进行形式逻辑底研究及其问题底科学探讨，把形式逻辑从中世纪经院哲学家和资产阶级学者所加之于它的唯心论的歪曲中解放出来。它的规律应当看作是现实底客观属性和关系在人们意识中的反映。
    （三）形式逻辑应当看作是认识现实的手段，而不是逻辑形式底无目的的游戏，因此，应当把一切无益的和人为的东西与一切不能由生活、科学和实践底要求所证实的东西从形式逻辑中排除出去。
    （四）研究或讲授形式逻辑，应当根据从苏联人民底观点看来是现实的材料，应当根据苏联现实和苏联生活底材料。这种材料应当表明形式逻辑是解决苏联科学和实践底现实任务并揭露和驳斥含有敌意的资产阶级观点和概念的手段（不是唯一的、不是主要的、但却是重要的手段）。
    形式逻辑和唯物辩证法底相互关系就是这样。必须简略地考察这一问题，才能确定形式逻辑底规律在对于现实的认识中的地位，在我们的反映客观现实的思想之表现和发展中的地位。
