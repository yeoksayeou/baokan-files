Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 8th: The commanders and fighters of a certain army corps of the North China Military Region People's Liberation Army have universally launched labor production during breaks in intensive training. Within two months, a certain army planted 525 mu of land and vegetables, cut 446,000 catties of grass, and chopped 236,000 catties of firewood, and raised 1,162 foxes; and opened flour mills and lime kilns. Almost every company of a certain division opened a tofu workshop. Through labor production, the troops' lives have been significantly improved. The food of a certain army generally exceeded the supply standard by about one-half. Each soldier in a certain company of the army could eat an average of 9.5 qian of oil, 7 qian of salt, 1 liang of meat, and 1.6 jin of vegetables per day, and saved 720,000 yuan of vegetable money and more than 1,600 jin of grain. A certain battalion harvested 200,000 jin of vegetables, enough to supply the entire battalion for two months. The soldiers cut grass themselves, and most units were able not only to supply livestock but also solve the problem of winter bedding grass. Each unit also used the proceeds from production to add stationery and other items. A certain division purchased 1,000 fountain pens for the soldiers with the surplus from production within one month. Simultaneously with labor production, the commanders and fighters of the army corps actively participated in the construction of barracks and highways and other national construction. A certain regiment repaired 35 li of highway in one day.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 8th: The commanders and fighters of a certain army corps of the North China Military Region People's Liberation Army warmly support Chairman Mao's "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Production and Construction Work in 1950," issued on the 5th. The army corps has now decided to launch a large-scale production movement from the spring of 1950 to increase the wealth of society and the country through labor, improve their own lives, and save some state expenditures. The leading organs of the army corps recently made a resolution, clearly pointing out that the general policy for developing production is: to focus on large-scale agricultural production, while developing certain light industries and side occupations. It is planned that each person will reclaim an average of 1.5 to 3 mu of wasteland next year. In terms of sideline production, it is planned to operate fish ponds, reed ponds, raise ducks, open pastures, and gradually establish iron factories, paper mills, rice mills, brick kilns, lime kilns, etc. In addition, near the farms, it is planned to build barracks, classrooms, playgrounds, highways, etc., so that national defense, production, training, and learning are fully integrated. The resolution also decided to use this winter as a time for production mobilization and preparation. The army corps has now hired several water conservancy and agricultural experts to participate in the preparation and formation of production committees at all levels, led by the heads of the CPC committees at all levels to lead the overall work, and established agricultural reclamation departments in the army corps, armies, and divisions to be responsible for the specific guidance of production work, and implement a unified operation, unified distribution, and unified bonus reward system. The army corps has now begun to survey land, test water volume, calculate labor, formulate production plans, and prepare farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers.
