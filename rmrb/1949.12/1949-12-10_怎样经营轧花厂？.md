How to Operate a Cotton Gin?
    Zang Chengyao
    In order to control the improved varieties of cotton reproduced in the improved seed management areas, maintain and improve purity, and facilitate large-scale promotion, the North China Cotton Improvement Office, in addition to reorganizing and transforming the five power cotton gins in Tongxian County and Nanyuan, etc., received from the former Beiping branch of the Cotton Improvement Office of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Nanyuan was converted to electricity, and Langfang was converted to diesel), and the Yangliuqing manual cotton gin. It has also newly built a power cotton gin each in the improved seed management areas of Handan, Linqing, Shijiazhuang, Lixian, and Baxian. All factories have started construction one after another. Over the past year, the following experiences have been gained in processing, maintaining, and improving the purity of improved varieties, and in enterprise-based management methods.
    　　　　1. Why Build Cotton Gins?
    The establishment of cotton gins by local cotton improvement institutions is to concentrate the ginned commodity seed cotton in the improved seed management area (except for the seeds retained by the masses themselves) in order to maintain and improve its purity, and to transport it to the surrounding areas of the improved seed area or other areas according to the promotion plan, for promotion, in order to gradually expand the improved seed area. During the cotton planting season, most of the staff of the cotton improvement institutions in various places participate in the promotion work, which becomes their basic task. Some people believe that the cotton gin should focus on operation, ginning ordinary varieties after ginning improved varieties, or concurrently operating oil mills and other businesses, and should not do or do less promotion work. However, we believe that doing so will increase the management burden of cadres, and may intentionally or unintentionally use cotton seeds as raw materials for oil extraction. At the same time, we cannot undertake the task of receiving and ginning ordinary cotton (of course, a small portion can be done), and lose the meaning of building a factory to maintain purity. In addition, there are a large number of power and manual cotton gins operated by cooperatives, institutions, flower, yarn and cloth companies, and private individuals (according to statistics in several cities in Hebei Province, there are 132 power cotton gins with 1,523 roller cotton ginning machines of 32 inches and 16 inches), which are sufficient to undertake the ginning of ordinary cotton. Especially for cooperatives that collect and gin cotton, as long as they strengthen organization and management, they can also play a great role in maintaining purity.
    This year, our cotton gins have adopted the principles of enterprise-based management. Because cost accounting greatly strengthens the cadres' sense of responsibility for the cause (such as the implementation of the progressive wage system, which increased the efficiency of cotton ginning by one-third). It changed the unreasonable system during the Kuomintang period, when costs were not calculated, and cadres' dividends alone reached 45%, and food was supplied. Preliminary experience shows that operating a cotton gin can not only solve expenses and prepare for re-production (except for those whose cotton fields are affected by disasters), but also have a surplus to be used for pure maintenance equipment. Accumulate funds for cotton seeds, cotton seed transportation, and rewards for model farmers. This principle of using the cause to support the cause should continue to be implemented.
    　　　　2. Conditions for Setting Up Cotton Gins
    The basic improved seed breeding area for building a cotton gin should have 10,000 to 20,000 mu of improved seeds as a prerequisite. Too few or no improved seeds will lose the meaning of building a factory. In terms of setting up, the following principles can be followed: 1. Factory address: It is advisable to choose transportation hubs and cotton production distribution markets, such as Shijiazhuang, Linqing, and other cotton producing areas, which are close to railways and river transportation, which is convenient for transportation and receiving cotton. It is also very convenient for building factories, repairing, and purchasing things. Conversely, if transportation is inconvenient, not only will the round-trip travel expenses be too high, but also if the machine parts are damaged and cannot be repaired locally, the downtime will be increased. 2. Try to use old houses for renovation. The five new factories this year are all renovated from old houses. The former Japanese barracks in Linqing can be used with slight modifications, which can store 1 million catties of cotton seeds. Both time and expenses are saved. Each factory, including machines and power, does not exceed 200,000 catties of rice. If a new building is built, the machine room alone will cost 200,000 catties of rice. 3. Electricity is the most economical power source, easy to install, and not easily damaged. Diesel engines are the second best. If gasoline is used, it will be more difficult. According to cost calculation, gasoline is roughly twice as high as diesel, and diesel is twice as high as electricity. Moreover, boilers are very complicated in terms of installation, use, and operation, and are not convenient to use. 4. In areas with few improved seeds and inconvenient transportation, it is best to organize farmers locally and concentrate manpower and animal power for ginning instead of building another factory. Because we are different from the large cotton farms operated by capitalists in capitalist countries, and even more different from the collective farms in socialist countries, we must build a power plant. At present, our rural areas are still a small-scale individual economy. In all cotton-producing villages, there are several households with manual cotton ginning machines. This year, the Nangong Liangzhong District organized the masses to gin, which saved a lot of manpower, material resources, and transportation costs, and farmers can also get some income during the slack winter season. As long as the organization is proper, purity and the quality of raw cotton can also be maintained. 5. The factory site should be flat, at least five mu in size, so that a cotton drying yard can be built. And try not to be in densely populated residential areas or near dangerous chemical factories to prevent fire.
    　　　　3. Unified Operation, Decentralized Leadership
    A. It is appropriate for cotton gins to be led and operated in a decentralized manner by the governments of each special county under the unified operation plan of the cotton improvement institutions. In this way, the unified plan of the cotton gins can be implemented, and the shortcomings that the central or provincial leadership cannot reach and cause certain problems cannot be solved in time can be overcome. Improved cotton seeds should generally be promoted locally so that all localities can have long-term plans. The 2B cotton seeds in Wu'an County have been promoted for two years. Thanks to the government's attention and strict management, the purity is still above 90%. They plan to turn all cotton in the county into 2B cotton within three years. Experience has proved that all those who attach importance to maintaining pure varieties and operate cotton gins have achieved greater results. For example, the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office directly led the cotton gin and collected 400,000 catties of improved seeds within a month.
    B. The promotion and ginning institutions can be combined into one (if there is a cotton farm, it can be a three-in-one) for unified leadership. Because the promotion institutions have less work in winter, and the ginning institutions have to stop work in summer, the combination of the two in terms of time is extremely appropriate. However, for the convenience of the cotton gin's operation, certain professional cadres can be set up, such as accountants, warehouses, custodians, and necessary long-term workers and technicians, and other personnel can be used completely mixed. When cotton collection and ginning are particularly busy, temporary personnel can be hired to remedy the situation. This summer, the Tongxian Cotton Gin had only three staff members and three long-term workers and technicians, who not only carried out promotion work but also ginned a portion of seed cotton, which also solved the expenses. In this way, the improved seeds become a whole from planting to processing, and the cotton gin also reduces the pressure of operating for break-even due to fewer cadres and less expenses, and can concentrate its energy on pure maintenance work.
    　　　　4. Organization is an Important Link
    A. This year's cotton collection and pure maintenance work has been given great importance by governments at all levels and relevant departments because it has undergone full organization, preparation and consultation. It is manifested in: The North China Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company provided sufficient funds for the purchase of improved seeds. The Tongxian and Nangong sub-companies even used the delivered cloth and grain to exchange for improved seeds as soon as possible. The cotton price issue basically implemented the preferential price policy. Except for individual areas and due to price fluctuations, the price of lint cotton generally reached eight catties of rice per catty. Linqing and Nangong reached nine and a half catties of rice, which was more than 10% higher than the price of ordinary cotton. The Cooperative Bank also provided the necessary cotton seed loans. The county and district governments in the improved seed areas convened village cadre meetings and mass meetings to mobilize the masses to select good seeds for separate collection and not to mix them, select good seeds, and sell the improved seed cotton directly to the cotton gins that maintain improved seeds. The village chief of Guotun, Linqing, said: "As long as the price is right, I guarantee that most of the 2B cotton in our village will be sold to the Cotton Improvement Office to ensure that there is no mixed cotton." Factories in Langfang, Tangshan, etc. convened meetings of private cotton gins, explaining the importance of cotton collection and pure maintenance, and preventing the mixing of improved seeds. Thanks to this series of organizational work, our acquisition of improved seeds has been going very smoothly. We have mastered more than 70% of the improved seed cotton sold. In the past two months, we have acquired 3.67 million catties, which can yield 2.44 million catties of cotton seeds. In addition, it is not difficult to complete the task of collecting 4 million catties of 2B improved seeds on behalf of the government in the improved seed areas.
    B. The cotton collection work of the cotton improvement institutions in various places is to maintain pure varieties, and various methods should be adopted to maintain and improve the purity and germination rate of the seeds. This year, when purchasing improved seeds, on the one hand, the village cadres issued introduction letters to prove whether it was 2B cotton or selected seeds (this is the focus of pure maintenance); on the other hand, strict grading inspections, separate collection, separate ginning, and separate storage were carried out. The Tongxian inspection found that individual mixed cotton was explained and criticized on the spot, which played a great role. Most factories have overcome the practice of simply purchasing improved seeds from the market and relying solely on grading inspection to maintain purity. In the Shimen Factory, the cotton seeds were ginned first, then cleaned, and then the small seeds and impurities were screened out with a flat screen before being stored. Linqing, Tangshan, Nangong, Nanyuan and other factories, in conjunction with the flower, yarn and cloth company, relied on the government to mobilize the masses to remove the stiff petals and miscellaneous seeds before selling the cotton to get a higher price. As for the seeds retained by the masses, the village government can organize manual cotton ginning machines and concentrate them for ginning at a certain time to avoid mixing. The above methods have played a great role in maintaining seed purity and improving the germination rate.
    C. It is more realistic and economical to build cotton gins with 32-inch roller cotton ginning machines. Because serrated cotton ginning machines cannot be manufactured in this country, development is difficult. The amount of cotton ginned by a 16-inch cotton ginning machine is more than half less than that of a 32-inch machine, but it uses two-fifths more workers. According to reports from various places, the ginning amount (seed cotton) of a 32-inch machine is up to 100 catties and at least 55 catties, while the maximum amount of a 16-inch machine is 37.5 catties. As for the government setting up manual cotton gins, purchasing ginning machines by itself, and hiring workers to gin with management personnel, it not only cannot solve the expenses due to low efficiency, but also there is no need to set it up again because there are mass manual cotton ginning machines in rural areas.

　　怎样经营轧花厂？
    臧成耀
    华北棉产改进处为了掌握良种管理区繁殖的良种，保持与提高纯度，以便大量推广，除将接收伪农林部棉产改进处北平分处之通县、南苑等五个动力轧花厂，杨柳青人力轧花厂，加以整顿改造外（南苑改用电力，廊坊改用柴油），在邯郸、临清、石家庄、蠡县、霸县等良种管理区，各新建动力轧花厂一处。各厂均已先后开工，一年来在经过加工保持与提高良种的纯度上，及企业化的经营管理方法上，取得如下几点经验。
    　　　　一、为什么建设轧花厂？
    各地棉产改进机构建设轧花厂，是为了将良种管理区（除群众自留种以外）的商品籽棉，集中轧出，以保持与提高其纯度，更根据推广计划，运到良种区周围或其他地区，进行推广，以便逐年扩大良种面积。在棉花种植季节，各地棉产改进机构的大部人员均参加推广工作，成为他的基本任务。有人认为轧花厂应着重经营，轧完良种再轧普通种，或兼营油房及其他业务，不应作或少作推广工作。但是我们认为这样作，会增加干部经营负担，可能有意无意地将棉籽充作榨油原料。同时我们也担负不了收轧普通花的任务（当然小部分的也可以），并失去建厂保纯的意义。此外尚有大量合作社及机关生产，花纱布公司，私人经营的动力和人力轧花厂（河北省几个城市统计，动力轧花厂一三二个，有三十二英寸，十六英寸的辊轴轧花车一五二三架），他们足够承轧普通花。特别是合作社收花、轧花、只要加强组织管理，在保纯上也能起很大作用。
    今年我们的轧花厂，采用了企业化的经营和管理原则。因为计算成本，大大加强了干部对事业的责任心（如实行了超额累进工资制，轧花效能提高三分之一）。改变了国民党期间，因不计算成本，仅干部分红利，即达百分之四十五，并供给伙食的不合理制度。初步经验证明，经营轧花厂不仅可以解决开支，及准备再生产（棉田受灾者例外），且能有赢余充作保纯设备。积累棉籽以及棉籽运输和奖励模范农户等的资金，这种以事业养事业原则，应该继续贯彻。
    　　　　二、设置轧花厂的条件
    建设轧花厂的基本良种繁殖区，以有良种一万亩至两万亩为先决条件，过少或没有良种，便会失去建厂意义。在设置上，可根据下列原则：一、建厂地址：以交通要道和棉花生产集散市场为宜，如石家庄、临清等产棉区，靠近铁路及河运，运输方便，收花也多，在建厂、修理、购置东西上都很便利。反之，交通不便，不仅来往路费太多，而机件损坏，当地不能修配，就要加多停工时间。二、尽量利用旧房改装。今年新建五厂，都是旧房改建，临清以前的日本兵营，略加修改，即可应用，能储存棉籽一百万斤。时间和经费都很节省，每厂连机器、动力在内，都不超过二十万斤米。如从新建筑，仅机器房一项即需米二十万斤。三、原动力以电力最经济，按装容易，不易损坏，柴油机次之，如用汽油则比较困难。按成本计算，大致汽油高于柴油一倍，柴油高于电力一倍，而且锅炉在按装、使用、经营上都很复杂，不便应用。四、良种不多和交通不便地区，最好是就地组织农民，集中人力车力代轧，不另建厂。因我们不同于资本主义国家资本家经营的大块棉场，更不同于社会主义国家的集体农庄，必须建立动力厂。我们目前农村，依然是小农个体经济，凡产棉村庄，都有几家合伙的人力轧花车。今年南宫良种区即是组织群众代轧，节省人力、物力、运费很大，农民在冬闲也可得到一些收入。只要组织得当，保纯及保持原棉质量，也能作好。五、厂房地址要平坦，最少有五市亩大，方可建立晒花场。并尽量不在人烟稠密的住宅区，或有危险性的化学工厂附近，以防火灾。
    　　　　三、统一经营，分散领导
    甲、轧花厂在棉产改进机构统一经营计划下，应由各专县政府分散领导经营为合适。如此既能贯彻轧花厂的统一计划，并可克服中央或省级领导鞭长莫及，致使某些问题不能及时解决的缺点。良种棉籽在一般情况下，应就地推广，使各地能有长远的计划。武安县二Ｂ棉种，已推广二年，由于政府重视及严格管理，纯度仍在百分之九十以上。他们计划三年内，全县棉花都变成二Ｂ棉。经验证明，凡当地政府重视保持纯种，办理轧花厂者，成绩都较大。如邯郸专署直接领导轧花厂，一个月内即收了良种四十万斤。
    乙、推广和轧花机构，可结合为一体（如有棉场可三位一体），统一领导。因推广机构冬天工作较少，轧花机构夏天便要歇工，双方在时间上的结合极为恰当。但为轧花厂经营上便利，可设一定专业干部，如会计、仓库、保管和必要的长工、技工等，其他人员可完全混合使用。收花轧花特忙时，可雇用临时人员补救。通县轧花厂，今年夏季，仅职员三人，长工技工三人，一面作推广工作，一面轧一部分籽棉，还解决了开支。这样作，使良种从种植到加工，成为一个整体工作，轧花厂也因干部少，开支小，减去了经营上为保本的压力，而能将精力专用到保纯工作上。
    　　　　四、组织工作是重要环节
    甲、今年收花保纯工作，因为经过了充分组织，准备与协商，所以各级政府及有关部门都极为重视。表现在：华北花纱布公司为收购良种，供给了充足资金。通县、南宫支公司更以运到的布匹，粮食尽先用于换取良种。棉价问题，基本上执行了优价政策，除个别地区及由于物价波动者外，每斤皮棉一般都达到八斤米，临清、南宫达到九斤半米，均比普通棉价高百分之十以上。合作银行并贷给了必需的棉籽贷款。在良种区的县区政府，都召开了村干部会、群众会，动员群众选良分收，不混杂，选好种，并将良种籽棉直接卖给保持良种的轧花厂。临清郭屯村长说：“俺村的二Ｂ棉，只要价钱合适，我保证大部卖给棉产改进处，保险没有掺杂花的。”廊坊、唐山等厂召开了私营轧花厂会议，说明了收花保纯的重要，不要使良种混杂。由于这一系列的组织工作，使我们收购良种工作进行得很顺利，掌握了出售良种籽棉的百分之七十以上，两个月来，已收购三百六十七万斤，可得棉籽二百四十四万斤。再加代替政府在良种区的公棉征收，保持四百万斤二Ｂ良种之任务，是不难完成的。
    乙、各地棉产改进机构的收花工作，是为保持纯种，应采用各种方法保持与提高种子的纯度和它的发芽率。今年我们在收购良种时，一方面由村干部开介绍信，证明是否二Ｂ棉或选种花（这是保纯的重点）；另方面，进行了严格的分级检验，分收，分轧，分存。通县检验出个别掺杂花的，当面进行解释批评，起作用很大。大多数的厂克服了单从集市上挑购良种及单纯依靠分级检验保持纯种的作法。在石门厂，先轧出棉籽继经过清籽，又用平筛将小籽、杂质筛去然后再存。临清、唐山、南宫、南苑等厂和花纱布公司结合，依靠政府，动员群众，卖花前僵瓣、杂籽挑去，得到较高价钱。至于群众的自留种，则可由村政府组织人力轧花车，集中于一定时间轧完，以免混杂，上述办法，对保持种籽纯度，提高发芽率上，都起很大作用。
    丙、建设轧花厂以三十二英寸辊轴轧花车比较现实，也经济。因锯齿轧花机本国尚不能制造，发展有困难。十六英寸轧花车，轧花量比三十二英寸少轧一倍以上，而多用工人五分之二。据各地报告：三十二英寸车的轧花量（籽棉）最高一百斤，最少五十五斤，十六英寸的最高三十七斤半。至于公家设人力轧花厂，自己购置轧车，设管理人员雇工轧花，不仅因效率低不能解决开支，同时农村有群众人力轧花车，亦无再设必要。
