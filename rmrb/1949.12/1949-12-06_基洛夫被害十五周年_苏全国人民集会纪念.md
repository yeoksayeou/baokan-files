　　"Pravda" wrote: The ideals of striving for international peace, eliminating exploitation of man by man, and striving for equality and friendship among all nationalities – ideals that Kirov so fervently upheld – continue to be victorious today in our country's construction of communism, in the socialist competition launched by all people's democratic countries, in the great victory won by the Chinese people, and in the establishment and consolidation of the peace-loving and democratic German Republic.

　　"Izvestia" wrote: In the fifteen years that have passed since Kirov's death, it has been proven that the ideals for which this great revolutionary fighter struggled under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin have been completely victorious. Kirov's life, full of revolutionary activity, indomitable will, and courage, and his struggle for the construction of socialism, will forever be an inspiring example for the Soviet people, the builders of communist society, and the fighters all over the world who are fighting for democracy and socialism.
