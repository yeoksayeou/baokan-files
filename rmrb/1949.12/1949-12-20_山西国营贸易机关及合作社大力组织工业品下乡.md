Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th. State-owned trading organizations and cooperatives in Shanxi Province are now vigorously organizing the downward movement of industrial products to the countryside to strengthen the direct exchange of industrial and agricultural products. Since September, the state-owned companies in the province have not paid enough attention to the work of promoting industrial products to the countryside and supplying the industrial necessities needed by farmers, resulting in a sharp decline in the marketing of agricultural products, which has seriously affected the urban-rural exchange in the province and the state-owned companies' procurement of grain and cotton. According to statistics, in October, 84% of the cloth sold by the Taiyuan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company was sold in the city; 60% of the cloth sold by the Taiyuan Department Store Branch Company was also sold in the city. Of the dyes, matches, kerosene and other goods sold by the Department Store Branch Company in October, 44% were also sold in the city. In 28 counties in southern Shanxi, such as Wanquan, Jie County, and Yicheng, the total value of grain and cotton supplied to the city by farmers from late September to mid-November was about 50 billion yuan, while the total value of industrial products going to the countryside during the same period was too small. Farmers could not get the industrial products they needed, especially cloth, and the amount of cotton on the market also decreased sharply. For example, at the Jiacunmiao market in Wanquan County, 30,000 jin of cotton were put on the market every market day in October, but only more than 500 jin every market day in mid-November. Due to the poor urban-rural exchange, the counties in northwestern Shanxi lacked cotton, and farmers made most of the fur that should have been exported into clothes, while 400,000 zhang of homespun cloth in southern Shanxi had difficulty selling. In view of the above situation, the Financial and Economic Committee of the province specifically instructed the branch companies and cooperatives of the state-owned companies in the province in mid-November to quickly organize the downward movement of industrial products to the countryside and strengthen retail work so that industrial necessities can directly reach the hands of farmers. The Taiyuan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company, the Department Store Branch Company, and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately transported goods to the countryside from November 20, and wholesaled them to the countryside through local state-owned stores and cooperatives. At the same time, they actively organized rural retail work. In villages with cooperatives, goods should be distributed to village cooperatives at each level. In areas without village cooperatives, the county federations of cooperatives should organize peddlers to go to the countryside to sell goods directly. Taiyuan also established a cooperative warehouse on November 24, specializing in exchanging industrial products such as cloth directly with agricultural products such as cotton and grain transported by farmers or rural cooperatives in various places. In this way, in the week starting from November 20, more than 94% of the more than 13,000 pieces of cloth sold by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company were transported to the countryside; the Department Store Branch Company and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also transported more than 1 billion yuan worth of industrial products to various counties in southern and northern Shanxi. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also plans to set up retail stores in the three important market towns under the jurisdiction of Wenshui and Jiaocheng.

　　山西国营贸易机关及合作社大力组织工业品下乡
    【新华社太原十八日电】山西省各国营贸易机关和合作社，现正大力组织工业品下乡，以加强工业品和农产品的直接交换。九月份以来，该省国营公司对于向农村推销工业产品和供给农民所需的工业必需品的工作注意不够，致使农产品上市锐减，严重影响该省的城乡交流，和国营公司对粮食、棉花的收购工作。据统计，十月份，太原花纱布分公司售出的布匹，百分之八十四系销售于市内；太原百货分公司售出的布匹销于市内者亦占百分之六十。百货分公司十月份售出的染料、火柴、煤油等各货，也有百分之四十四系销于市内。晋南万泉、解县、翼城等二十八个县，从九月下旬到十一月中旬，农民供应城市的粮食、棉花总值约五百亿元，而同一时期下乡的工业品总值则太小。农民因得不到所需工业品，特别是布匹，上市棉花亦跟着锐减。如万泉县贾村庙集市，十月份每集上市棉花三万斤，十一月中旬每集仅五百余斤。由于城乡交流不畅，晋西北各县因缺乏棉花，农民将应该出口的皮毛大部做了衣服，而晋南却有四十万丈土布销售困难。根据上述情况，该省财政经济委员会特于十一月中旬，责成该省各国营公司的分支公司和合作社，迅速组织工业品下乡，并加强零售工作，使工业必需品能直接达到农民手里。太原花纱布、百货等分公司和该省供销合作总社，于十一月二十日起立即积极运货下乡，通过各地公营商店和合作社向农村批发。同时并积极组织农村零售工作，凡有合作社的村，货物要逐级发到村合作社，没有村合作社的地区，即由合作社的县联合社组织货郎担子下乡直接售货。太原并于十一月二十四日成立了合作货栈，专门以布匹等工业品直接与农民或各地农村合作社运来的棉粮等农产品进行交换。这样，在十一月二十日开始的一周中，花纱布分公司售出的一万三千多匹布中，即有百分之九十四以上运至农村；百货分公司和该省供销总社也有价值十余亿元的工业品，运往了晋南、晋北各县。省供销总社并拟在文水、交城所属的三重要集镇设立零售店。
