Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: The "Mass Picture Publishing House," primarily tasked with editing and publishing new serial picture books (also known as "Little Man Books"), has been established recently. Serial picture books have a wide circulation and exert a significant influence on children and some illiterate adults. How to replace the toxic old content in many existing serial picture books with new content that conforms to the interests of the people has become a serious problem. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government recently discussed this issue in conjunction with the General Administration of Publications, and prepared to organize the "Mass Picture Publishing House." Lou Shiyi, Cai Ruohong, Zou Ya, Zhao Shuli, Miao Peishi, Zhang Ding, Hu Man, Wang Chaowen, and Liu Jian'an were nominated to be responsible for the work of the publishing house. The publishing house plans to publish 120 new serial picture books next year, and will also coordinate the editing and publishing of New Year pictures, monthly calendars, and other popular illustrated reading materials.

The city's various art groups enthusiastically responded to the call of the Ministry of Culture to produce New Year pictures. To date, seventy drafts have been completed, of which more than twenty have been submitted to the Xinhua Bookstore for printing and will be published successively next month.

    【新华社北京二十九日电】以编印新的连环图画（亦称“小人书”）为主要工作的“大众图书出版社”已于日前成立。连环图画销行甚广，对于儿童和部分不识字的成人影响甚大。如何以合乎人民利益的新内容，代替现有许多连环图画中含有毒素的旧内容，成为一个严重问题。中央人民政府文化部日前协同出版总署曾就这个问题进行商讨，并筹备组织了“大众图画出版社”，经推定由楼适夷、蔡若虹、邹雅、赵树理、苗培时、张仃、胡蛮、王朝闻、刘建庵等负责该社工作。该社预计明年将出版新连环图画一百二十种，此外并将配合编印年画、月份牌及其他通俗图画读物。
    本市各美术团体热烈响应文化部的号召，制作新年画，迄今已完成画稿七十幅，其中二十余幅已交由新华书店印行，下月即将陆续出版。
