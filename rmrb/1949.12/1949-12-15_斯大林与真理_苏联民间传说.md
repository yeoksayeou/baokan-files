　　Stalin and Truth
    ——A Soviet Folk Tale
    Stalin saw the light from a great distance. In that place where the sun shines all year round, where the rivers never freeze, all the needles of the trees have been replaced by broad leaves. This was a long time ago. At that time, in our swampy area, the Russians used white wine to exchange furs from the hunters.
    Stalin shed the down of childhood and donned the feathers of youth, and became friends with Truth. This was the most formidable comrade at that time. Truth's eyes were as bright as the North Star, able to see all the bad deeds of people, no matter how they tried to hide them. His tongue was like an arrow, wounding people, and never healing. Therefore, many people feared him, and bad people—the rich and merchants who oppressed the working people—drove Truth out of their homes, like a wolf entering a pasture, inciting dogs to bite him.
    Stalin knew this, but he was a resolute man, and he was not afraid to place Truth in his home, calling him a fellow countryman, a comrade.
    When the bad people learned of this, they went to the "Emperor" to accuse Stalin.
    "Do you know," they said to him, "that Stalin has befriended Truth and invited him into his home?"
    The "Emperor" was furious and ordered that Stalin be brought to him. When Stalin arrived, he shouted at him:
    "You wretch deserving of divine punishment! Who are you calling 'comrade'? Are there not enough good people to be your comrades? Renounce Truth!"
    "No!" said Stalin, "I cannot find a better friend, I will not break with Truth!"
    The "Emperor" became even angrier.
    "I will give you the richest and most noble people in my country to be your comrades. When comrades are together, you yourself will become rich and noble. Renounce Truth!"
    "No!" Stalin said again, "The richest and most noble people in your country cannot be my comrades. They are very bad and do bad things."

　　斯大林与真理
    ——苏联民间传说
    斯大林从这儿老远的看见了光明。在那太阳整年照着的地方，在那江河从来不冻的地方，一切树木的针叶，都是阔叶代替了的。这是很久以前的事了。那时候在我们的沼泽地带里，俄国人用白酒到猎人手里换去了毛皮。
    斯大林从自己身上脱去童年的绒毛，换上青年的羽毛，就同真理交起朋友来了。这是那时候最可怕的同志。真理的眼睛亮得好象北极星似的，能看见人们一切的坏事，他们无论如何隐瞒也不行的。他的舌头好象箭似的，刺伤了人，永远是好不了的。因此，好多人都怕他，坏人们——欺侮劳动人民的有钱人和商人——都从自己家里把真理赶出去，好象进到牧场里的狼似的，唆使着狗去咬他。
    斯大林晓得这个，可是他是果敢的人，他不怕把真理安置到自己家里，称他做同乡，同志。
    坏人们知道了这个，都到“皇帝”那里告斯大林去了。
    “你晓得，”他们对他说：“斯大林同真理交朋友，并且把他请到自己的家里了吗？”
    “皇帝”火起来了，吩咐叫把斯大林带来。当斯大林来了的时候，他对他嚷道：
    “你这该天诛地灭的！你给谁称‘同志’呢？好人能给你做同志的还少吗？你弃绝了真理吧！”
    “不！”斯大林说：“找不到再好的朋友呢，我不同真理绝交！”
    “皇帝”更恼起来了。
    “我把我国内最富的人，最贵的人给你做同志。同志们在一起，你自己也将成了又富又贵的人了。你同真理绝交了吧！”
    “不！”斯大林又说：“你国内最富的和最贵的人，不能做我的同志呢。他们很坏，干着坏事。”
