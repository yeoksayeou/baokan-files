　　"When will you be back?"
　　The people of Jinggang Mountains long for Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu

　　"Better to have Mao and Zhu than parents, better than anything is the Red Army!" This is the heartfelt cry of the Jinggang Mountains farmers groaning and struggling under the slaughter and exploitation of Chiang Kai-shek and Xiao Jiabi's bandits. Wei Lianfa, who composed this song, is still alive, and the song has spread to every village in the mountains.

　　When Chairman Mao was in Jinggang Mountains, the farmers had food to eat and clothes to wear, rice stored in boxes, and clothes stored in cabinets. Life was good! Everyone said that Jinggang Mountains was as "lively as the capital!"

　　"This is all thanks to Chairman Mao!" The farmers understood in their hearts.

　　But before long, the White Army came, people were killed, houses were burned, and the farmers looked forward to Chairman Mao's return day and night. They said, "If Chairman Mao were here, would we suffer like this?"

　　Chairman Mao lives in the hearts of the farmers of Jinggang Mountains. Everyone remembers his tall stature, eating with the farmers, holding meetings, speaking in the midst of the masses, often leading the team to fight the reactionaries himself... Chairman Mao's deeds constantly float in the farmers' minds, and the more they think about it, the more they look forward to it.

　　Five years ago, the farmers heard that Chairman Mao had hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the north, and they also heard that the Japanese devils were afraid of Chairman Mao's troops. Everyone's hearts blossomed with joy, and the farmers dreamed of him!

　　This time, after we returned to Jinggang Mountains, the farmers asked us as soon as they met:

　　"Where are Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu?"

　　"When will you be back?"

　　We showed the farmers the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Adults, children, and women crowded around. Old Lady Zou held the portraits far away and then close again. She squinted and said, "Hmm, he's fatter now, he had thin cheeks then, hmm, that's great!"

　　The women fought to grab them, and the children also clamored for them. Every time we arrived at a village, we were routinely asked to take out the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for everyone to see.

### “什么时候回来呀？”　井岗山上的人民盼望毛主席朱总司令

　　“什么时候回来呀？”
　  井岗山上的人民盼望毛主席朱总司令
    “爹在娘在不如毛朱在，千好万好不如红军好!”这是井岗山的农民呻吟挣扎在蒋介石萧家璧匪徒们屠杀剥削下的心声，编这个歌子的魏连发，现在还活着，歌子传遍了山区每一个村子。
    毛主席在井岗山时，农民们有吃有穿，箱子里存着米，柜子里存着衣服，日子可好过呢！大家说那时井岗山象“京都一样热闹！”
    “这都是毛主席给的福！”农民们心里都明白。
    但是，日子没过多久，白军来了，人被杀死了，房子被烧了，农民们日夜盼毛主席快回来，他们说：“毛主席要是在这里，我们会受这些苦？”
    毛主席活在井岗山农民们的心坎上。大家都记着他高高的个子，和种田的人在一块儿吃饭，开大会，站在群众中间讲话，常常自己带队伍打反动派……毛主席的事迹，不断浮在农民们的脑子里，越想也就越盼。
    五年前农民们听说毛主席在北方有百把万兵马，又听说日本鬼子就怕毛主席的队伍，大家的心都喜得开了花，农民们做梦都梦见他！
    这次，我们回到井岗山后，农民们见面就问：
    “毛主席，朱总司令在什么地方呀？”
    “什么时候回来呀？”
    我们把毛主席和朱总司令的像片拿给农民们看，大人、孩子、妇女挤成一大堆，邹老太太把像片举得远远地，又靠得近近地，她眯缝着眼说：“嗯，现在胖了，那时候是瘦腮巴，嗯，真好！”
    妇女们争着抢到手，孩子们也吵着要，每到一个村子，我们照例被要求拿出毛主席和朱总司令的像片给大家瞧。
