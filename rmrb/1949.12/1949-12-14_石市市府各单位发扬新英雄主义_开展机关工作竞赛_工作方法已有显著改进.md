　　Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Units Promote New Heroism
  　Launching a Work Competition in Government Offices
    Significant Improvements in Working Methods Have Been Achieved
  　The Key to Continuing to Advance the Competition Movement
  　Enthusiastically Work and Delve into Professional Skills
    Some Cadres' Erroneous Attitudes Must Be Corrected
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The work competition aimed at creating and improving work methods has been universally launched in various units of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government. In the past twenty days, thanks to the hard work of all cadres in delving into their professional work, the leadership methods and work methods of various units have been significantly improved, and the chaotic phenomenon in work has been overcome or is being overcome. The achievement of these results is due to the clear understanding of the competition goals and the in-depth ideological mobilization carried out by various units. Before the start of the competition, leading cadres and general cadres alike conducted ideological self-criticism, which greatly strengthened their sense of responsibility. The relationship between superiors and subordinates has become more harmonious due to the self-criticism of leaders. The implementation of collective leadership and a system of division of labor and responsibility has initially overcome the passive and chaotic phenomena in work. However, there are still shortcomings in the work competition that need to be corrected urgently. The main problem is that many cadres rely solely on enthusiasm in their work, going to work early and leaving late, only knowing how to extend working hours, but not knowing how to create and improve work methods. Therefore, work efficiency is not high and cannot be sustained. This is due to a lack of clear understanding of the purpose of the office competition. In addition, some cadres have adopted erroneous attitudes towards the work competition. For example, some veteran cadres believe that they have been engaged in revolution for many years and can certainly do their work well, and there is no need for competition to motivate them. They do not realize that although veteran cadres have generally established the idea of serving the people, if they are satisfied with the status quo and are unwilling to humbly learn new experiences, create new work methods, and cannot unite and lead new cadres to make progress together, they will become an obstacle to the competition. Some new cadres believe that they are already working hard and are very stressed, and they cannot handle any further competition. They do not realize that merely having good work enthusiasm is not enough; they must also study policies, delve into and create new work methods, learn work experience from veteran cadres, and improve work efficiency. The worst is that some people have strong individualistic ideas, believing that the competition is about "catching the big shots," and claiming that they cannot participate in the competition until their personal problems are resolved. The leadership has severely criticized this serious selfish and self-serving thinking, and demanded that these comrades thoroughly reflect on themselves. In order to deepen the competition further, the municipal leadership has once again explained that the purpose of the competition is to improve work methods, improve work style, improve work efficiency and quality, create scientific methods from work, and affirm them through practice to form a system, so as to improve work. To this end, leading cadres must lead by example and participate in the competition; go deep among the masses, discover problems, and summarize experiences. We must strengthen education and help transform the backward ideas existing in some cadres; at the same time, we must promptly commend models and establish typical examples to further promote the competition movement.

　　石市市府各单位发扬新英雄主义
  　开展机关工作竞赛
    工作方法已有显著改进
  　继续推进竞赛运动的关键
  　热情工作钻研业务
    若干干部的错误态度须纠正
    【本报专讯】以创造与改进工作方法为目标的机关工作竞赛，在石家庄市人民政府各单位普遍展开。二十天来，由于全体干部埋头钻研业务，各单位的领导方法、工作方法已有显著改进，工作中的忙乱现象已被克服或正在克服着。这些成绩的取得，乃是由于各单位明确地认识了竞赛目标，进行了深入的思想动员。竞赛开始前，领导干部以及一般干部均作了思想检查，大大加强了责任心；上下级关系，则因检查了领导，而益趋融洽。实行了集体领导，分工负责制，工作中的被动和混乱现象得以初步克服。但是工作竞赛中仍存在着急待纠正的缺点，主要是有不少干部，在工作上单凭热情，早上班、晚下班，只知延长工作时间，而不知道如何去创造与改进工作方法，因此，工作效率不高，且不能持久，这是由于对机关竞赛的目的认识不清而来的。另外，有若干干部对工作竞赛采取了错误态度，如有的老干部，认为自己革命多年，还能不干吗？用不着竞赛来激励。不知道老干部虽一般地树立了为人民服务的思想，但若满足现状，不肯虚心学习新鲜经验，创造新的工作方法，不能团结带动新干部共同进步，则会成为竞赛的障碍。有的新干部认为自己本来就是努力工作的，已经很紧张了，再一竞赛，吃不消。不知道仅仅有好的工作热情还不够，还必须学习政策，钻研并创造新的工作方法，向老干部学习工作经验，提高工作效率。而最坏的是有些人存在着浓厚的个人主义思想，认为竞赛是“捉大头”，说什么他个人的问题如不解决，他就竞赛不起来。对这种严重的自私自利思想，领导上已进行了严厉批判，要求这些同志加以彻底反省。为了使竞赛深入一步，市领导上再次说明：竞赛的目的是改进工作方法，改善工作作风，提高工作效率和质量，从工作中创造科学的方法，经过实践，肯定下来，形成制度，以便提高工作。为此，领导干部必须以身作则，参加竞赛；深入群众，发现问题，总结经验。对某些干部存在的落后思想，要加强教育，帮助改造；同时，要及时表扬模范，树立典型，把竞赛运动推进一步。
