　　Stalin's Brilliance Illuminates the Revolutionary Path of Humanity
　　People Worldwide Warmly Prepare to Celebrate the 70th Birthday of the Revolutionary Leader
　　Asian Women's Representatives Victoriously Meet in Beijing
    The Asian Women's Representatives Conference, which the world's democratic women had eagerly anticipated, opened grandly in Beijing on the 10th. This is the second international conference of great significance held in the capital of New China after the Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference. This ongoing international event is a conference of great unity among Asian women and their unity with women around the world. This conference is convened under the direct leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation. This unified leading body of democratic women, with 59 member countries, has always shown deep sympathy and support for the struggle of oppressed women in Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries. Now, it is taking further practical actions to help and support the struggles of oppressed sisters in many Asian countries. Participants in this conference include not only representatives from all democratic women's organizations in Asian countries, but also women representatives from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, progressive women representatives from Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, as well as women representatives from Cuba and oppressed countries in Africa. This undoubtedly has enabled Asian women to unite more closely with women around the world through this conference. According to the agenda of the conference, the main task of this conference is to discuss the struggle of Asian women for national independence, people's democracy, and world peace, as well as the protection of women's rights and children's rights, and to exchange experiences and learn from each other on these issues, in order to further unite and strive for common goals. It can be seen here that Asian democratic women have closely combined their own liberation movement with the national liberation movement, the people's democratic movement, and the movement to defend world lasting peace. Because it is inconceivable to talk about women's liberation without national liberation and people's democracy, and without world lasting peace, the cause of women's liberation will not be guaranteed. This marks an unprecedented increase in the level of awareness of Asian women. The convening of this conference is also a major bankruptcy of the imperialist reactionaries' conspiracy to undermine world women's unity. The Women's International Democratic Federation originally planned to hold the Asian Women's Representatives Conference in Calcutta in October 1948, but it failed to materialize due to the obstruction of the Nehru reactionary government, followers of American and British imperialism. However, just over a year later, Asian women finally victoriously gathered in the free land of New China. Now, there is no longer any force that can stop the united struggle of Asian women. This conference will be a new sign of the further development of the Asian women's movement and the Asian national liberation movement, and also a new sign of the further development of the cause of striving for world lasting peace and people's democracy. The victorious Chinese people are honored that this grand event is held in China and wish it complete success.
    The movement to prepare for the celebration of the 70th birthday of Stalin, the great leader of mankind, has developed into a mass movement on a world scale. This reflects the sincere feelings of the vast number of people in the world towards Stalin and the Soviet Union he leads, and also shows that the revolutionary doctrine of Marx-Lenin-Stalin has been universally believed by the working masses and has become the light and hope of all mankind. The Soviet people are greeting this festival with new production victories and with the determination to undertake higher guarantees that exceed production plans. The Soviet government has also organized a committee headed by Shvernik to be responsible for planning and organizing related celebration matters. The people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe are preparing to celebrate Stalin's birthday in various forms. The working people in these countries are enthusiastically launching labor competitions to greet Stalin's birthday. The people in capitalist countries, especially the people in Western European countries, are preparing to greet this festival with the same joy and excitement. They are grateful to the Soviet Red Army led by Stalin for defeating German fascism and liberating them. They are preparing to send countless birthday gifts and congratulatory letters signed by thousands of people to Moscow. French young women embroidered on a banner sent to Stalin: "The country of Daniel and Canova will never fight against the country of Danya." The victorious Chinese people are preparing to celebrate with special joy. Because the Chinese people deeply know that Stalin is a good friend of the Chinese people, Stalin's doctrine has illuminated the path of the Chinese revolution, and the friendship of Stalin and the Soviet Union under his leadership has played a great role in the victory of the Chinese people. Recently, the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has decided to carry out various celebrations and publicity activities within a week from the 15th to the 21st of this month, and has invited various agencies and organizations to form a birthday celebration preparation committee to actively carry out various preparation matters. At the same time, the General Association calls on local branches to universally and deeply publicize Sino-Soviet friendship, publicize Stalin's thoughts and doctrines, and launch a movement to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet national construction.
    The Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 20, concluded on December 11. During this session, which lasted for more than two and a half months, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries resolutely fought for world lasting peace, exposed and打击ed the war conspiracies of American and British imperialism, and protected the rights of oppressed nations, winning the sympathy and support of the vast number of people in the world. Regarding the results of this meeting, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky made an appropriate evaluation before leaving the United States to return home on the 6th, pointing out that it "cannot be satisfactory." This is because, under the manipulation of the American and British groups of the "majority", the General Assembly passed a series of reactionary resolutions that fundamentally violated the spirit of the founding of the United Nations and only conformed to the aggressive purposes of the imperialists. These resolutions can be summarized into three categories: The first category of resolutions undermines the organizational principles of the United Nations Charter. The UN General Assembly violated the principle of fair regional distribution, passed the election of the Tito gang as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and passed an illegal resolution to extend the "Little General Assembly" indefinitely, thereby continuing to undermine the authority of the Security Council. The second category of resolutions interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, slanders the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and barbarously invades weak nations. The resolutions passed by the General Assembly on submitting the so-called "Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania's violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms" to the International Court of Justice for resolution, on extending and even expanding the privileges of the illegally established "United Nations Commission on Korea", and on the blatant interference in the internal affairs of countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Korea; The resolution on Italian colonies decided to shamelessly divide the former Italian colonies. The third category of resolutions seriously endangers the cause of world peace and security. Under the manipulation of the American and British groups, the General Assembly passed the joint proposal of Britain and the United States, the so-called "Essentials of Peace," which, in the name of peace, actually infringes upon the national sovereignty of other countries, but rejected the Soviet proposal to condemn the preparation for a new war, strengthen the Five Powers' peace treaty, and ban atomic weapons. This fully exposes the true colors of the American imperialist warmongers.
    Progressive People's Gathering in the US and UK Advocates Friendly Cooperation with the Soviet Union and China
    Despite the fact that the international reactionaries headed by the United States are making trouble everywhere, they are frantically opposing the Soviet Union and New China, they want to undermine world peace and actively prepare for war, but the vast majority of people around the world oppose the reaction of American imperialism, they sincerely support the Soviet Union and New China, and they are determined to fight to defend world peace. A clear example is the three-day US-Soviet relations conference held in New York, USA on the 3rd. The conference passed a resolution representing the will of the American people, demanding that the US government immediately change its dangerous war policy, end the anti-Soviet "Cold War", establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and recognize the People's Republic of China as soon as possible. On the 5th, New York held a mass rally of 12,000 people to "declare the atomic bomb illegal." The rally pledged to step up and expand the struggle against war-mongers in the United States. At the same time, the National Committee of the Progressive Party of the United States held a meeting on the 3rd and 4th. The meeting passed a resolution on peace, advocating the conclusion of a treaty stipulating atomic weapons as illegal, demanding the immediate establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China, calling for the implementation of a policy of peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union, and opposing the reconstruction of German armed forces. The situation is similar in the UK. The British-China conference, initiated by British progressives, was held in London on the 3rd and 4th. The conference, representing two million British people, welcomed the founding of the People's Republic of China and resolved to demand that the British government immediately establish diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of China on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereign independence. The meeting also decided to establish a new British-China Friendship Association to strive for the realization of the above goals.

　　斯大林的光辉照亮人类革命道路
    全世界人民热烈筹庆革命领袖七十寿辰
　　亚洲妇女代表胜利会师北京
    世界民主妇女一致热望的亚洲妇女代表会议，已于十日在北京隆重揭幕，这是继亚澳工会代表会议之后第二个在新中国首都召开的具有重大意义的国际会议。正在进行中的这一国际盛会是亚洲妇女大团结和她们与世界妇女大团结的会议。这次会议是在国际民主妇联直接领导之下召开的，这一拥有五十九个会员国的世界民主妇女的统一领导机关，对于亚洲殖民地、半殖民地国家被压迫妇女谋求解放的斗争，一向寄予深厚的同情和声援，现在则更以进一步的实际行动来帮助与支持亚洲许多国家被压迫姊妹们的斗争了。参加这次会议的，不仅包括了亚洲各国所有民主妇女组织的代表，而且还有苏联和捷克的妇女代表，英、美、法、荷等国进步的妇女代表，以及古巴、非洲被压迫国家的妇女代表。这无疑已使亚洲妇女通过这一会议而和全世界妇女更亲密地团结起来了。根据会议的议程，这次会议的主要任务，是要讨论亚洲妇女为民族独立、人民民主与世界和平而斗争，以及保护妇女权利和儿童权利等问题，并就这些问题交流经验，互相学习，以便为共同目标而进一步团结奋斗。这里可以看出：亚洲的民主妇女已把本身的解放运动，和民族解放运动、人民民主运动以及保卫世界持久和平运动密切地结合起来，因为离开民族解放和人民民主而谈妇女解放，这是不可设想的，而没有世界的持久和平，妇女的解放事业也同样不会有保障。这就标志着亚洲妇女的觉悟程度已经空前地提高了。这次会议的召开同时又是帝国主义反动派竭力破坏世界妇女团结阴谋的大破产。国际民主妇联原定于一九四八年十月在加尔各答召开亚洲妇女代表会议，但由于美英帝国主义的追随者尼赫鲁反动政府的阻挠，而没有开成。但相距仅仅一年多，亚洲妇女终究在新中国的自由土地上胜利会师了，现在已经再没有任何力量能够阻止亚洲妇女的团结斗争了。这次会议将是亚洲妇女运动和亚洲民族解放运动更加向前发展的新标志，也是争取世界持久和平与人民民主事业更加向前发展的新标志。胜利了的中国人民对这一盛会在中国之举行引为光荣，并预祝它的完全成功。
    筹备庆祝人类的伟大领袖斯大林七十大寿的运动，已经发展成为世界规模的群众运动，这反映了世界广大人民对于斯大林和他所领导的苏联的真挚情感，也说明了马克思——列宁——斯大林的革命学说已为劳动群众所普遍信奉，成为全人类的光明和希望。苏联人民正以新的生产胜利，以及决定承担更高的超过生产计划的保证来迎接这一节日。苏联政府并组织了以什维尔尼克为首的委员会，负责筹划和组织有关庆祝的事宜。东南欧人民民主国家正筹备以各种形式为斯大林祝寿，这些国家中的劳动人民，正热烈展开劳动竞赛来迎接斯大林的寿辰。资本主义国家的人民特别是西欧各国的人民，以同样欢欣鼓舞的心情准备迎接这一节日，他们感谢斯大林领导的苏联红军战胜了德国法西斯并解放了他们。他们正在准备将无数的寿礼和成千成万人签名的贺函送往莫斯科。法国女青年在送给斯大林的锦旗上绣着：“但尼尔和卡诺瓦的国家，永远不会对丹娘的国家作战。”胜利了的中国人民则以特别欢欣的心情准备祝寿。因为中国人民深深知道：斯大林是中国人民的好朋友，斯大林的学说照亮了中国革命的道路，斯大林和他领导下的苏联的友谊帮助，对中国人民的胜利起着伟大的作用。最近，中苏友好协会总会已决定自本月十五日至二十一日一周内，进行各项庆祝宣传，并已约请各机关团体组成祝寿筹备会，积极进行各项筹备事宜。总会同时号召各地分会普遍深入地宣传中苏友好，宣传斯大林的思想学说，展开学习苏联建国的先进经验的运动。
    九月二十日开始举行的联合国大会第四届会议，已于十二月十一日宣告结束。在历时两个半月有余的这次大会上，苏联和人民民主国家的代表，坚决为世界持久和平而斗争，揭露和打击美英帝国主义的战争阴谋，保护被压迫民族权利，博得了世界广大人民的同情和支持。关于这次会议的结果，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于六日离美返国前，曾作了恰当评价，指出它“不能令人满意”，这是因为这次大会在美英集团操纵“多数”的情况下，通过了一连串的反动决议案，而这些决议案根本违反了联合国创建的精神，只符合于帝国主义者的侵略目的。可以把这些决议案归纳为三类：第一类决议案是破坏了联合国宪章组织原则的。这次联大违背公正的地域的分配原则，通过了铁托匪帮担任安理会的非常任理事，又通过无限期延长“小型联大”的非法决议，从而继续破坏着安理会的职权。第二类决议案干涉他国内政，诽谤苏联和人民民主国家，并野蛮地侵略弱小民族。大会所通过的关于把所谓“保、匈、罗侵犯人权与基本自由问题”交付国际法庭解决，关于延长以至扩大非法成立的“联合国朝鲜委员会”的特权，凶横地干涉保、匈、罗、朝鲜等国的内政；关于意大利殖民地的议案，决定无耻地瓜分前意大利的殖民地。第三类决议案严重地危害了世界和平与安全的事业。大会在美英集团的操纵下，通过了英美两国以和平为名实际上侵犯他国国家主权的所谓“和平要义”联合提案，而竟否决了苏联所提关于谴责新战争准备，五强加强和平公约与禁用原子武器的提案，这就充分暴露了美帝国主义战争贩子的原形。
    美英进步人民集会主张与苏中友好合作
    尽管以美国为首的国际反动派到处捣乱，它们疯狂地反对苏联和新中国，它们要破坏世界和平和积极备战，但是全世界广大人民都反对美帝国主义的反动，它们热诚地拥护苏联和新中国，它们坚决地为保卫世界和平而斗争。在美国纽约于三日举行了为期三天的美苏关系会议就是一个明显的例证。会议通过了代表美国人民意志的决议，要求美国政府立即改变危险的战争政策，结束反苏“冷战”，与苏联建立友好关系，早日承认中华人民共和国。五日，纽约又举行了有一万二千人参加的“宣布原子弹为非法”的群众大会，大会保证加紧和扩大反对美国国内战争贩子的斗争。同时，美国进步党全国委员会于三、四两日举行会议，会议通过了关于和平的决议案，主张缔结规定原子武器为非法的条约，要求立即与中华人民共和国建立外交和贸易关系，呼吁实行与苏联和平合作的政策，反对重建德国武装。在英国情况也是如此。由英国进步人士所发起的英中会议，于三、四两日在伦敦召开。会议代表二百万英国人民欢迎中华人民共和国的成立，并决议要求英国政府立即在平等互利和互相尊重领土完整和主权独立的基础上，与中国中央人民政府建立外交关系。会议同时决定成立新的英中友好协会，为上述目标的实现而奋斗。
