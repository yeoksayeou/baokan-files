[News Report] The organs in Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, under unified leadership, carefully inspected wasteful phenomena in their work and formulated a thrift plan, which is now being implemented. During the inspection, Cheng Dahuang, Secretary of the Ji'an County Party Committee, first inspected his own work, promoting all departments to conduct conscientious inspections. For example, the Civil Affairs Section of the County Government discovered that when building a bridge fifty li away from the city, they had not planned well in advance, resulting in the excess transportation of forty bags of cement and twenty zhang of planks, wasting manpower and animal power for transportation. After the inspection, all organs established thrift systems and have begun to implement them. The County Government and other organs have removed unnecessary telephones and electric stoves. The Jiang'an Office stipulates that the goods warehouse should be inspected once a week, and all accounts adopt a strict system of responsibility at each level.

　　辑安县各机关检查浪费
  　严格执行节约制度
    【本报讯】辽东省辑安县各机关，在统一的领导下，仔细检查了工作中的浪费现象，并订出节约计划现已开始执行。在检查当中，中共县委书记程大荒首先检查了自己的工作，推动各部门都作了认真的检查。如县府民政科检查出修建离城五十里的大桥时，事先未计划好，多运去四十包洋灰，二十丈板子，浪费往返人畜劳力。检查后各机关均建立了节约制度，并已开始实行，县政府等机关已撤去不必要的电话和电炉，江岸办事处规定货物仓库每星期检查一次；一切帐目采取严格的按级负责制。
