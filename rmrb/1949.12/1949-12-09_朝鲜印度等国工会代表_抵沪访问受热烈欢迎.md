　　Trade Union Representatives from Korea, India, and Other Countries
　　Arrive in Shanghai for a Visit and Receive a Warm Welcome
    The delegation of representatives from Korea, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Ceylon, who attended the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 8th for a visit. Those who went to the station to welcome them included Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi, Deputy Mayors Zeng Shan and Pan Hannian, Second Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu Xiao, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Liu Changsheng, as well as more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life, including workers, youth, and women. Female workers presented flowers to the representatives. The welcoming masses held a welcoming meeting at the station square. At the meeting, Mayor Chen Yi delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "This is the first time in Shanghai's hundred-year history that so many worker representatives from Asian and Australian countries have come to Shanghai. For many years, imperialism and Chinese reactionaries have used various methods to block the connection between the people of Shanghai and the working class of the world, but due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, this obstruction has failed; the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference led by the World Federation of Trade Unions has pointed out a concrete path of unity and struggle for the people of Asian and Australian countries. This proves that the cause of world people's democracy and peace cannot be stopped by any reactionary forces." Choi Kyung-deok, head of the Korean delegation, said in his reply: "The great victory won by the Chinese people has not only opened a new era for the Chinese people, but also provided a clear direction and path forward for the struggles of oppressed nations around the world. Your victory is not only yours, but also the victory of the Korean people, and at the same time the victory of oppressed nations around the world." Wickremasinghe, a representative from Ceylon, also praised the great historical significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution in his speech.

    【新华社上海八日电】出席亚澳工会代表会议的朝鲜、印度、印尼、越南、泰国、锡兰的代表一行，已于八日晨抵沪访问。到车站欢迎的有沪市人民政府陈毅市长，曾山，潘汉年副市长，中共上海市委会第二书记刘晓，上海市总工会筹备会主任刘长胜以及职工、青年、妇女等各界代表二千余人、女工们并向代表献花。欢迎群众在车站广场举行欢迎会。会上，陈毅市长致欢迎词说：“这么多的亚洲澳洲各国工人代表来到上海，是上海百年来的第一次。多年以来帝国主义和中国反动派曾用各种办法阻隔上海人民与世界工人阶级的联系，但由于中国人民革命的胜利，这个阻隔已经失败；世界工联所领导的亚澳工会代表会议的成功，为亚澳各国人民指出了团结奋斗的具体的道路。这证明世界人民民主和平事业，是任何反动势力所不能阻止的。”朝鲜代表团团长崔璟德致答词时说：“中国人民所争取的伟大胜利，不仅是给中国人民开辟了新纪元，而且使全世界被压迫民族的斗争有了明确的方向和前进的道路。你们的胜利不仅是你们的，而且是朝鲜人民的胜利，同时是全世界被压迫民族的胜利。”锡兰代表魏克玛沁格亦在讲话中盛赞中国革命胜利的伟大历史意义。
