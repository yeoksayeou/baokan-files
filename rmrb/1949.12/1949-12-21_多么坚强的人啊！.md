　　What a Strong Person!
　　Guan Hua
　　This happened a very, very long time ago. I don't know what year it was, but I know it was in winter. The Tsar sent many, many police and gendarmes to hunt down Stalin. At the same time, he set a heavy reward. No matter who it was, as long as they caught Stalin, not only would they become the richest person in all of Russia, but they would also become a high-ranking official in front of the "Emperor".
　　On the Siberian Grand Post Road, the gendarmes' carriages were speeding frantically. They were tracking and chasing Stalin, but Stalin did not take the main road. He was walking in the great forest.
　　The sky was snowing heavily, and the wind was howling, swirling the snow on the ground and in mid-air. The whole world was shrouded in this great "white whirlwind." Nothing could be seen five steps away. The heavy snow filled in the pits and hollows, and even piled up in high places. Stalin walked forward in this wind and snow. Sometimes he fell into the snowdrifts and was buried in the snow, but he climbed up, shook himself, and continued to move forward.
　　Snowflakes stuck to Stalin's eyebrows and beard, turning them silver-white. Snowflakes stuck to his clothes, turning them silver-white too. Snowflakes fell on his face, turned into small water droplets, rolled on his beard, and immediately froze into ice. Stalin became a big white snowman.
　　He carried a small backpack on his back, which contained a little bread, but it was frozen as hard as ice. The backpack was covered with thick snow, making Stalin look like a hunchback.
　　Stalin was tired, thirsty, and hungry, but in such a heavy wind and snow, it was impossible to start a fire. So, as he walked, he put the frozen, cold, and hard bread into his mouth and chewed hard. Even this kind of bread was running out.
　　A wild wolf was running around in the forest looking for something to eat. Suddenly, it heard some noise. Then it saw Stalin. The wolf secretly watched this walking man, hoping that he would fall down quickly so that it could go up and eat him. But Stalin did not fall, and continued to walk forward.
　　Stalin planned to enter Petersburg secretly.
　　I don't know how many days he walked. One day, he walked out of the forest. Ah! Before him was a vast plain, sparkling and white with ice and snow. This was a river called the Yenisei River.
　　It was getting dark. In the hazy mist, faint yellow and dim lights flickered in the distance. Stalin knew that it was a village, so he quickened his pace on the Yenisei River. The lights got closer and closer. Seeing that he was not far from the village, Stalin was so happy!
　　Just then, his body sank. Damn, the ice covered with snow had cracked. The Yenisei River, like a demon, suddenly opened its dark mouth to swallow Stalin.
　　Stalin fell into the ice hole. Below was black water many fathoms deep! However, Stalin stretched out his arms and hung on the edge of the thick ice. The cold river water immediately poured into his boots and into his clothes. When he climbed out, he had no strength at all. He fell to the ground like a big tree.
　　When he stood up, his clothes were already frozen into ice. He made a clattering sound with every step he took, and pieces of ice kept falling to the ground.
　　A woman in the village came to the well to fetch water. When she saw Stalin coming from the front, she cried "Mom..." and threw the bucket away and ran away. Anyone who encountered him immediately turned and ran away.
　　Stalin gently knocked on the window of a house. After a while, the door of the house creaked open.
　　The locals had an old rule that they were not allowed to question passing guests. The host let this strange man into the house. Stalin felt a warm air rush into his face. The light was very bright, shining on Stalin's clothes, flashing straightly.
　　They put the guest on a recliner. Slowly, Stalin warmed up and fell asleep.
　　Adults and children stood beside Stalin and watched him, thinking, "Where did he escape from? And where is he escaping to? What's his name? What a strong person he is!"

### 多么坚强的人啊！

　　多么坚强的人啊！
    管桦
    这是很久很久以前的事情，不知道是在那一年，只知道是在一个冬天，沙皇派了很多很多的警察宪兵，到处追捕斯大林，同时，又定出重重的奖赏，无论是什么人，只要捉住斯大林，不但使他成为全俄罗斯的大富翁，并且，还到“皇帝”跟前做大官。
    西伯利亚大驿路上，宪兵们的马车拼命的飞驰着。他们是跟踪来追赶斯大林的，可是斯大林却没有走大路，他在大森林里走着。
    天，正在下着大雪，风啊！呼呼地，卷着雪在地上，在半空中打旋转。整个的世界，都迷迷蒙蒙罩在这大的“白毛旋风”里。离开五步远，就什么也看不见了。大雪把坑坑洼洼都填平了，而且还向高处堆起来。斯大林就这样冒着风雪向前走，有时陷进雪堆里，被雪埋起来，可是他爬上来，抖抖身子还是向前走。
    雪花粘在斯大林的眉毛上和胡须上，眉毛和胡须就变成银白的了。雪花粘在衣服上，衣服也变成银白的了。雪花落在脸上，化成小水珠，滚在胡子上，立刻就冻了冰。斯大林变成一个白白的大雪人。
    他背上背着一个小背囊，背囊里装着一点面包，可是早冻的象冰一样坚硬了。背囊上落成厚厚的雪，看起来，斯大林就好象一个驼背的人。
    斯大林又累，又渴，又饿，可是在这样的大风雪里，是不能烧起野火来的，于是他就一边走着，把冻成象冰块一样又凉又硬的面包放进嘴里，使劲的嚼着。就是这样的面包也只有一点点了。
    有一只野狼，正在森林里跑来跑去的搜寻东西吃，忽然，它听见了什么响声，于是它看见斯大林了。这只狼，就暗暗地看着这个走路的人，它盼望着这人快跌倒下来，马上就可以上去把他吃掉。可是斯大林没有跌倒，仍旧向前走着。
    斯大林打算秘密地进入了彼得堡。
    不知又走了多少日子。这一天，他走出了森林，啊！眼前是一片开阔的平原，亮闪闪，都是白白的冰雪。这是一道河，名叫叶尼塞河。
    天快黑了，在昏昏沉沉的雾气里，远处闪烁着一点一点又黄又暗的灯光，斯大林知道那是个村庄，于是在这叶尼塞河上面脚步就加快起来。灯光越近越近，眼看离村庄不远了，斯大林心里多么高兴啊！
    就在这时，身子往下沉，糟了，脚底下盖着白雪的冰裂开了，叶尼塞河内象一个妖魔，突然张开漆黑的大口，要把斯大林吞下去。
    斯大林掉在冰窟窿里，底下就是多少丈深的黑水呀！可是，斯大林把两只胳膊张开，就挂在厚冰的边缘上了。冰凉的河水立刻灌进靴筒里，灌进衣服里，等他爬出来的时候，混身一点力气也没有了，他象一棵大树，倒在雪地上了。
    他站起来的时候，衣服已经冻了冰，走一步就哗啦哗啦响，碎冰块不住的往地上掉。
    村子里有一个妇女到井沿来提水，看见斯大林从前面走来，她“妈呀……”的叫了一声，把水桶扔掉，撒腿就跑了，只要是碰见他的人，都立刻扭头跑掉。
    斯大林轻轻地敲着一年房屋的窗子，不一会，房屋的门吱嘎一声开开了。
    本地人有个老规矩，不许盘问过路的客人，主人把这奇怪的人让进屋里，斯大林就觉着有一股暖烘烘的热气扑上脸来，灯光很亮，照着斯大林的衣服，一闪闪的直放光。
    他们把客人放在一个躺椅上，慢慢地，斯大林就暖和过来了，睡着了。
    大人和孩子们都立在旁边望着斯大林，心里想着：“他是从那里逃来的呢？又逃到那里去呢？他叫什么名字？他是多么样一个坚强的人啊！”
