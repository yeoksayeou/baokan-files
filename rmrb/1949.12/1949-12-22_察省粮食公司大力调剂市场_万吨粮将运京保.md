　　察 Province Grain Company Vigorously Regulates the Market
　　Ten Thousand Tons of Grain to be Shipped to Beijing to Ensure Supply
　　[Our Dispatch from Zhangjiakou] Since the lifting of the epidemic prevention blockade in Chahar Province in mid-November, the grain market has become increasingly active. Taking Zhangjiakou as an example, the daily market supply of grain has more than doubled compared to the initial period. The Chahar Province Grain Company, adhering to the principle of not stimulating grain price increases, is now systematically purchasing grain. Due to the epidemic prevention blockade, there was a shortage of daily necessities in the province. The Chahar Province Grain Company shipped 18,000 bolts of homespun cloth in late November. This month, the company transferred 300,000 bolts of homespun cloth from the North China Grain Company and, in cooperation with cooperatives, transported them to various places to exchange for food grain. In order to supply a large amount of food grain to the citizens of Beijing and Baoding, the company has successively shipped out a large amount of food grain and is now planning to transport ten thousand tons of grain to Beijing and Baoding before the end of the year.

　　察省粮食公司大力调剂市场
    万吨粮将运京保
    【本报张家口专讯】察哈尔省自十一月中旬解除防疫封锁后，粮食市场日趋活跃。以张家口为例，每日上市粮食已较最初的上升到一倍有余。察省粮食公司本着不刺激粮价上升的原则，现正有计划的收购粮食。该省前因防疫封锁，日用品曾感缺乏，该省粮食公司于十一月下旬曾运到一万八千匹土布，本月份该公司又从华北粮食公司调拨到三十万匹土布，与合作社配合运往各地换购食粮。为了大量供应京市及保定市民食粮，该公司已先后运出大批食粮，现正计划在年底前将万吨粮食运往北京及保定两市。
