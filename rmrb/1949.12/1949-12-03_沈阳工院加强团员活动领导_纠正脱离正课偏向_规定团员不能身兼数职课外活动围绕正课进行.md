Northeast News: For the past three months, the activities of the Communist Youth League at the Shenyang Institute of Technology have not been centered on supporting regular coursework, which has affected the academic performance of League members and reduced the prestige of the League among students. This is now being corrected.

Over the past three months, the Communist Youth League in the institute played a significant role in assessing people's scholarships, labor construction, and coordinating cultural and recreational activities related to the People's Political Consultative Conference and the October Revolution, but did not conduct extracurricular activities centered around regular coursework. Although mutual aid groups were established, they were completely inactive. League members concentrated their efforts on cultural and recreational activities, such as large-scale dramas like "Revenge," "Steel Bones and Iron Muscles," and "Life is Calling," which took up a lot of time. In addition, League members did not rely on other students and did everything themselves. As a result, most League members held multiple positions. According to a survey of 231 League members, 137 held two or more positions, 81 held three or more positions, and some even held six positions. This affected their review time. For example, League member Gong Rongzhang held six positions, including class leader, student union member, League group leader, and person in charge of singing and acting. Three-quarters of his extracurricular time was spent on these activities, and only one-quarter was spent on reviewing his coursework. Although his grades used to be excellent, he recently got only 5 points in applied mechanics. The grades of other League members also generally declined. According to a survey of 118 League members, the number of those who originally had excellent grades dropped from 28 to 14, while the number of those who received poor grades increased from 14 to 20.

The Communist Youth League in the institute has recently begun to correct these deviations. First, it explicitly stipulated that League members should become role models in their studies, thereby promoting the improvement of academic performance among the majority of students. It also immediately strengthened mutual aid groups to achieve mutual assistance based on teacher guidance and self-study. Other extracurricular activities are also centered around regular coursework, such as conducting academic lectures and discussions. Second, it stipulated that League Day should be held twice a month for current affairs discussions, current affairs quizzes, and recreational evenings. Cultural and recreational activities are fixed within the designated extracurricular activity time every afternoon, mainly focusing on short plays, singing, and other activities that are not time-consuming and can mobilize general students to participate. Regarding the issue of holding multiple positions, the principle of one person, one position is adopted, and students are mobilized to share the responsibilities.

Before the correction, most League members felt depressed because they could not manage their courses well, and some even wanted to drop out of school. Some students also looked down on League members because of this. After correcting this deviation, League members felt happy and expressed confidence in restoring their original grades within a month. Students also felt that this was of great benefit to them.

　　沈阳工院加强团员活动领导
  　纠正脱离正课偏向
    规定团员不能身兼数职　课外活动围绕正课进行
    【本报讯】东北消息：沈阳工学院青年团三个月来的活动，没以配合正课学习为中心，因此影响团员学习成绩，并减低了青年团在同学中的威信。现已加以纠正。
    该院青年团三个月来，虽然在评定人民助学金、劳动建校及配合人民政治协商会议与十月革命节开展文化娱乐活动等工作中起了很大的作用，但没围绕正课学习进行课外活动。虽成立了互助小组，但完全没有活动，团员只集中力量搞文化娱乐，而文化娱乐又是“复仇”、“钢骨铁筋”、“生命在呼喊”等大型剧，非常耽误时间。加上团员不依靠同学，有事就是团员干，因此大部团员都是身兼数职，据二百三十一名团员的统计，兼两职以上者有一百三十七名，三职以上者八十一名，甚至还有三个人一身兼六职者。这样就影响了他们的复习时间，如团员宫荣章担任班长、学生会委员、团小组长、负责唱歌演剧等六职，他的课外时间四分之三都用于这些活动，用于功课复习的时间仅四分之一。本来他过去的成绩是上等，最近考应用力学却得五分。其余团员的成绩也普遍降低，据一百一十八名团员的统计，原得上等成绩的二十八名，现仅十四名，而得下等成绩的却由十四名增到二十名。
    该院青年团最近已开始纠正这些偏向，首先明确规定团员在学习中应成为模范，进而推动广大同学学好功课，并立即健全互助小组，在教师指导与自学的基础上达到互助的目的。其余课外活动也以正课学习为中心，如进行学术讲演与讨论会等。其次规定每月举行团日两次，进行时事座谈、时事测验、文娱晚会等活动。文化娱乐活动则固定在每天午后规定的课外活动时间内进行，同时也主要搞小剧、歌咏等既不费时又可发动一般同学参加的活动。关于兼职问题，则以一人一职为原则，发动同学共同担负。
    没纠正以前，一般团员都因搞不好课程而感到若闷，有的甚至想休学，同学中有的也因此看不起团员。纠正此偏向后，团员都感到愉快，且表示有信心在一个月内恢复原有的成绩，同学也感到这样的对他们有很大好处。
