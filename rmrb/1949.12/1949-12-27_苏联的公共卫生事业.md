　　The Soviet Union's Public Health Undertakings
　　Translated by Xu Jianda
　　The health of the people is one of the important matters for the Communist Party and the Soviet government. The Soviet Federation is the only country in the world that provides free medical services to all its people; this is a fundamental right established by the socialist system and written into the Soviet Constitution.
　　The amount of money spent on public health increases year by year. During the last World War, despite the unlimited expenses used to compensate for the work of cities, villages, industries, and transportation, the Soviet Union's budget for 1947 still approved 189 billion rubles for public health, 205 billion rubles in 1948, and 216 billion in 1949.
　　In addition to these funds, large amounts of money are spent from the state social insurance fund to protect the health of the people. They are used for trade union sanatoriums, rest homes, children's sanatoriums, Young Pioneer summer camps, and forest health schools. Medical expenses and sanatorium accommodation fees are also a payment item in the social insurance fund, with 150 billion rubles paid out in various situations in 1949.
　　In the Soviet Union, all professionals have joined social insurance organizations, and donations from various business organizations are its only source. The operation of social insurance is entrusted to the trade union by the state. This fund is used in the hands of the workers themselves because they are all members of the trade union.
　　The Soviet social insurance system is completely converted to true democracy, which is fundamentally different from the social insurance undertakings of capitalist countries.
　　During the most difficult last war, the establishment of hospitals and prevention stations did not continue, but once the war ended, all the hospitals, prevention stations, and sanatoriums destroyed by the enemy were restored in a very short time, and at the same time, new hospitals and health stations were re-established in vast areas.
　　The steady improvement of the Soviet people's living standards, coupled with the continuous improvement of public health services and the high development of sports games, has greatly reduced diseases. Infectious diseases that were very prevalent in Russia during the Tsarist period, which used to cause the loss of tens of thousands of lives every year, have now been completely eliminated.
　　To illustrate this progress in public health services, we can prove it by the increase in hospitals and prevention stations paid for by the Soviet Ministry of Health. In 1947, the number of beds in urban and rural hospitals increased sixfold compared to 1913, while the number of outpatient hospitals in cities increased twelvefold. In the Tsarist era, there were only 4,472 clinics in rural areas, but today there are 15,542 rural medical stations and 51,464 rural clinics, as well as maternity hospitals. During the Tsarist period, it was impossible to find even a single medical station in Moldavia, but now there are 783.
　　The changes in Soviet rural life brought about by collective farms are reflected in the rural medical services. Today, the people of collective farms pay attention to the different characteristics of most medical personnel: surgeons, general practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians, etc. If a particularly complex disease occurs in a remote rural area, experts are selected from the city and transported by air using diagnostic machines to rescue those who are suffering.
　　Here are a few examples to illustrate the success of the Soviet health services:
　　Before the revolution, Yuzovka, an industrial center in the Donets Basin, where the largest factories were foreign-owned, had a small hospital with only one doctor, one assistant, and one pharmacist. Today, Yuzovka, in the city of Stalino, can boldly say that it has forty-three hospitals, forty-eight prevention stations, seventy-eight medical stations, twenty mother and child health centers, nineteen special clinics, and ten emergency stations, plus a research center for occupational diseases of workers and a medical university.
　　The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kamenetz-Podolsk region, Yankov District, has the same obvious transformation. Before the revolution, there was only one rural medical station in that place. In 1948, there were three hospitals, with 30 beds, four clinics, two mother and child health centers, two children's food supply stations, a maternity hospital, an infectious disease prevention and treatment院, and a medical laboratory.
　　In Georgia, under Tsarist rule, there were only eleven outpatient hospitals and prevention stations in 1913, but now there are six hundred. Tajikistan, with two hospitals, was very satisfied with itself before the revolution, but compared with the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, which now has 131 hospitals, 290 clinics, and prevention stations, the truth is a world apart.
　　No other country in the world cares for and worries about mothers and children as much as in the Soviet Union. There is no other place where mothers can receive so much help from their country in raising their children as in the Soviet Union. It has 6,416 mother and child health centers, 5,993 urban and rural maternity hospitals (excluding more than 5,000 supported by collective farms), 18,345 permanent nurseries (increasing monthly), 3,571 children's food supply stations, and a network of other specialized institutions to take care of the health and interests of mothers and children. All of these services are free.
　　Public health concerns all the public, and each local Soviet has its permanent health committee, which recruits many volunteers, especially women, to develop their role.
　　Public health authorities supply cities and villages with skilled and effective medicine to care for them. Doctors who used to only care for patients in hospitals are now caring for matters in clinics and outpatient hospitals, and doctors in clinics and outpatient hospitals are also required to spend part of their time in hospitals so that they can understand a patient's condition from the onset of the disease to his complete recovery.
　　The Soviet Union's training of medical personnel is superior to all other countries. It has 200,000 doctors, nearly 100,000 assistant doctors and nurses. The number of medical personnel is incomparable to other countries.
　　Doctors and nurses are highly respected by the government, the Communist Party, and the general society, and their services are familiar to the people. Tens of thousands of them have been awarded medals for their outstanding medical skills and their efforts for the public interest, 3,000 people enjoy the title of honorary doctor of the republic, and more than a hundred people have received Stalin funds for their valuable medical discoveries or for their superb treatment methods.
　　Soviet medical skills proved their value in the Second World War. Thanks to the knowledge and skills of the medical personnel, their full attention, and the high degree of medical organization, more than 72 percent of the wounded personnel in the Navy, Army, and Air Force were fully recovered and returned to the front line, and 90 percent of the diseases on the front line were completely cured, enabling patients to resume their combat tasks as healthy people.
　　There is a close organic link between scientific medicine and practical medicine in the Soviet Union. Medical research institutions have their public clinics, and professors and lecturers at medical universities across the country complete their knowledge under the supervision and guidance of outstanding professors and academicians. Professors and lecturers at medical universities often go to remote areas to perform complex surgeries and help local doctors.
　　A few years ago, under the government's resolution, it was determined that a Soviet specialized medical university would be established to study the advanced theoretical and practical problems of maintaining health. Under this policy, it has a total of 26 research institutes and four laboratories.
　　Soviet medical scientists have continued the excellent and glorious traditions of outstanding Russian doctors such as Pirogov, Pavlov, Sechenov, Botkin, Mechnikov, and Gariya, and have prospered their country's medicine with new and valuable inventions and contributions.

　　苏联的公共卫生事业
    徐建达译
    人民的健康是共产党和苏维埃政府的重要事务之一。苏维埃联邦是世界上对全国人民的医药服务免费供给的唯一的国家；这是社会主义制度的建立并写在苏联宪法上的基本权利之一。
    一年一年增加的金额，用在公共卫生上。在上次世界大战中，尽管无限的花费用于尽补偿城市、乡村、实业和运输等工作，但在苏联一九四七年的预算中还批准了一千八百九十亿卢布，作公共卫生之用，在一九四八年是二千零五十亿卢布，一九四九年是二千一百六十亿。
    除这些款项外，大量的金额从国家社会保险金内支出，用于保护人民的健康。它们用于职工会疗养院，休息所，儿童疗养院，青年先锋夏令营，和森林健康学校。医疗费和疗养地的招待费也是社会保险金内的一项支付，在一九四九年在各种情形下，付出了一千五百亿卢布。
    在苏联所有的职业人员都加入了社会保险机构，各事业机关的捐赠是它唯一的来源，对于社会保险的经营，是由国家委托于职工会，这个经费是运用在工人自己的手中，因为他们都是职工会的会员。
    苏维埃的社会保险制度是完全皈依真正的民主，这点是他社会保险事业根本与资本主义国家不同的地方。
    在最困难的上次大战中，医院以及预防站的建立是没有继续，但一当战争结束，所有被敌人所毁坏的医院，预防站，和疗养院在很短时间之内便恢复起来了，同时广大地区重新建立起新的医院和卫生站。
    苏维埃人民生活水准稳定的提高，经常对于公共卫生服务的增进和在体育游戏高度的发展下使疾病大大地减少了，沙皇时期在俄国流行得非常利害的传染病，每由这些传染病每年丧失了成万的生命，而现在已经是完全消灭。
    要说明这种公共卫生服务的进步，我们可以由医院和预防站在苏联卫生院的经费支付下而增加来证明，一九四七年在城市和乡村医院里的病床，比一九一三年增加了六倍，同时在城市里的门诊医院却增加了十二倍，帝俄时代的乡村只有四四七二个施诊所，而今天却有一五五四二个乡村医药站，和五一四六四个乡村门诊所，以及产妇科医院，沙皇时期在摩达维亚要仅仅找一个医疗所都不可能，而现在已有了七八三个。
    集体农场所促成的苏维埃乡村生活的变化，可由乡村医药的服务反映出来，今天集体农场的人民，注意于大多数各种医药人员不同的特质：外科医生、普通医生、儿科医生、产科医生等等。如在辽远的乡村，发生特别复杂的疾病时，即以城市挑选专家用争诊机从空中运送去援救那些受苦者。
    这里有几个例子来说明苏维埃卫生服务的成功：
    在革命前乌佐夫加一个在顿纳兹盆地的工业中心，那里最大的工厂是为外国人所有，设有一个小小的医院，只有一个医生，一个助手，及一个药剂师，今日的乌佐夫加在斯大林诺城，可大胆地说有四十三个医院，四十八个预防站，七十八个医疗所，二十个母子中心医院，十九个特别门诊所，和十个救急站，更加上一个劳工因职业而得的疾病的研究处，以及一个医科大学。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国，肯门列兹，坡多尔斯地方的咏可夫基区，有同样显明的转变，革命前那地方仅有一个乡村医疗站，在一九四八年有三个医院，包有三○个病床，四个门诊所，两个母子中心医院，两个儿童饮食供给站，一个产科医院，一个传染病防治院，以及一个医药实验室。
    在沙皇统治之下一九一三年只有十一个门诊医院和预防站的乔治亚，而现在已有六百个。有两个医院的答吉克斯坦，在革命前他自己就觉得很满意了，但与现在有一三一个医院，二九○个门诊所，以及预防站的答吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国来比较，真相差天坏了。
    世界上没有别的国家的母亲和孩子是这样地被照顾和悬念着，如在苏联一样，没有其他地方的母亲，能够受到如此多的帮助，从他们的国家在养育她们的孩子方面象在苏联一样，他有六四一六个，母子中心医院五九九三个城市和乡村的产妇医院（除开五千多个是由集体农场支持的），一八三四五个永久的托儿所（按月增加）三五七一个儿童饮食供应站，以及网布着的其他专门的机构来照顾母亲和小孩健康和利益，所有的这些服务都是免费的。
    公共卫生是有关于所有公众的事，每个地方苏维埃，有他的永久的卫生委员会，这些委员会招收许多的志愿者，尤其是妇女去发展她们的作用。
    公共卫生机关供应城市和乡村以熟练的和有效的医药来照顾，从前只在医院里照顾病人的医生，现在护理在诊疗所和门诊医院的事，同时在诊疗所和门诊院的医生亦要求把他们一部分的时间放在医院里，因此使他们可以明了一个病人从得病起到他完全恢复所经过的情形。
    苏联在医药人员的训练是驾乎一切国家之上，他有二十万个医生，近十万个助理医生和看护，医疗人员之多，为其他国家所不可比拟的。
    医生和护士是高度的为政府、共产党以及普遍的社会所尊敬的，同时他们的服务是被人民所熟悉的。其中数万人都因为有卓然的医术手腕以及他对公共利益的努力而受到勋章，三千人享有共和国荣誉医生的头衔，百多个人由于他们的有价值的医药发现，或者因他们治疗方法的高超，而得到了斯大林资金。
    苏维埃的医术在第二次世界大战中，证明了他的价值，谢谢医药人员的知识和手腕，他们尽全力的注意和高度的医药组织，在百分之七十二以上的海陆空军的受伤人员，都得到完全恢复而重上前线，百分之九十在前线的疾病都完全治好。使病人能够重新负担他们战斗的任务如同健康的人一样。
    苏联在科学医学和实用医学间有一个密切的有机的连系，医学研究机关有他们公共的临床所，全国各地医科大学的教授和讲师，在优秀的教授与院士的监督和指导下，来完成他们的学识，医科大学的教授和讲师，经常到辽远的地区去行复杂的手术，并且帮助各地的医生。
    数年前在政府的决议下，确定一个苏联专门医科大学是为研究维护健康的高深的理论和实际的问题而设立的，在这个方针下，他共有二十六个研究院，以及四个实验所。
    苏维埃的医学科学者，继续了优秀的俄国医生比罗哥夫、巴夫乐夫、色琴乐夫、波第金、麦克里可夫、驾里雅等卓越的光荣的传统，用崭新的而有价值的发明和贡献，使他们国家的医学繁荣起来。
