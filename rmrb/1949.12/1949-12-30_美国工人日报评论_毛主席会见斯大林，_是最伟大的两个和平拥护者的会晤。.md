    Chairman Mao's Meeting with Stalin is a Meeting of the Two Greatest Advocates of Peace.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 28th] The New York Worker's Daily published an editorial on December 19th entitled "Mao Zedong Meets Stalin," stating: This is a meeting of the world's two greatest advocates of peace. The Worker's Daily wrote: The generous assistance that the Soviet Union has given to the people's democracies of Eastern Europe since the end of World War II has enabled these countries to accomplish miracles in industrial progress. Stalin taught the people of the Soviet Union that the bastion of national independence is heavy industry; he is now teaching the newest member of the great socialist family of nations the same thing. The newspaper pointed out that China has broken its chains and is beginning to build modern factories with the help of the Soviet Union, and is laying the foundation for a strong, mechanized agriculture. The newspaper concluded: The relationship between China and the Soviet Union will be one of brothers, equality, and independent countries working for the common goals of democracy, peace, and socialism.
