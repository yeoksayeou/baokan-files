　　Grand Evening Party Held by Beijing Publishing Industry
　　Welcoming Shanghai Publishing Delegation
　　[From our newspaper] More than ten publishing units in Beijing, including Xinhua, Sanlian, Lianying, and Kaiming, held a grand evening party for over a thousand people at the Chang'an Grand Theater on the evening of the 5th, to welcome the Shanghai Publishing Delegation visiting Beijing.

　　The chairman of the conference first reported on the significance of the meeting, explaining that in the past, under the rule of the reactionaries, publishing work suffered severe oppression and destruction. Today, under the leadership of the people's government, the New Democratic culture is developing vigorously. The publishing industry has unlimited bright prospects, and our task is glorious and significant. This evening party is an unprecedented grand gathering of unity between the Beijing and Shanghai publishing industries. We must work together to welcome the high tide of new cultural construction.

　　Then, Zhang Jingru, the head of the Shanghai Publishing Delegation, gave a brief introduction to the gains from visiting North China and Northeast China. He also called on everyone to learn from the revolutionary publishing cause in the old liberated areas and, even more, to learn from the experience of the publishing industry in the Dalian and Lushun areas, under the assistance of the socialist elder brother, the Soviet Union, in order to engage in our cultural construction work.

　　Finally, Xinhua Bookstore performed "Workers' Dance" and "Chorus," Sanlian Bookstore performed the opera "Ten Rolling Balls" and "Four Sisters Striving for Glory," and Kaiming Bookstore and others jointly performed Peking Opera to add to the festivities.
