Having lit the carbide lamps for the fifth day, the water in the East Mine was also drained. Old Yin summarized the land distribution work and reported to the district. In the afternoon of the following day, he heard that everything was fine at the mine, so he didn't go to the mine site. He didn't look for anyone, only sought out a few people who were being considered for Party membership to chat with. But at this moment, the smell near "Seven" in the East Mine suddenly became severe. People couldn't stay there, and Bian Xiao ran up to the mine site, coughing so hard he couldn't straighten his back. Da San grabbed his broken top hat and fanned him as if it were the scorching heat of June. Later, Shuan Cheng said, "There's no way! How about whoever digs it out, each shift gets an extra pound of white flour? Anyway, it'll be quick." Da San said, "I've had this idea for a while, but there's no way to hold a democratic discussion! Sigh... Old Yin isn't back yet!" Shuan Cheng said, "It doesn't matter! This is a critical moment, we can talk about it later!" Little Foreign Devil immediately spread the news, and Niu Bao was the first to sign up: "I'll take one! It's been ages since I've seen white flour!" Then a few others signed up, including Bian Xiao and Tian Lu, who didn't want the white flour and rushed down to work. Bian Xiao told everyone, "Try not to breathe in too much when you go down, hold your breath as long as you can." In this way, each person digging at "Seven" could last for about three or four cigarettes' worth of time. The people digging at "Seven" also messed up the shifts, whoever could dig would go up and work for a while. Da San and Shuan Cheng also got their hands dirty. They worked in such a chaotic way until midnight. Looking outside the mine site, the three stars were right overhead in the sky. Suddenly, "Seven" in the East Mine disappeared! Coal was found! People on both sides could hear each other clearly! The sound of the picks even made people's heads ache! Da San took the lead, digging out the coal himself, and Tian Lu also started working at the top of the West Mine ventilation shaft. At this time, every time a piece of coal was taken down, the sound of the picks became louder, and people inside and outside the mine shouted, "It's through!" "It's connected!" "There's no doubt about it now!" Da San told people, "Keep working hard! Keep calm!" But for a long time there was no news! Later, the first rooster crowed, and the people outside the mine became anxious and slowly cooled down. Some of the mine workers who weren't involved even wanted to go back to sleep! Just then, following the rooster's crow, there was a burst of shouting from the bottom of the mine: Hey! Shuan Cheng, who had entered from the East Mine, came out from the West Mine entrance!

People inside and outside the mine, up and down, chattered noisily, everyone asking and answering in confusion: "Is it through?" "It's through!" "It's been through for a while!" Shuan Cheng shouted, "Fried eggs with white flour pancakes! Who's paying? I'll pay two thousand!" Xi Lu was so happy he was trembling, "I... I'll pay five thousand!" In an instant, several tens of thousands of border currency were raised, without even counting. Little Foreign Devil even shouted at the shareholders who had gone home to sleep, and brought back a small basket of eggs to the supply room. Lin Bao chased after him and shouted, "Let me do it, you don't know how to cook." Little Foreign Devil hurriedly dropped the eggs and ran out, saying, "Aren't we going to call Old Yin?" Shuan Cheng said, "He's not back!" Suddenly someone remembered that Old Yin had returned, so Little Foreign Devil stuck out his butt and ran in one breath to Shuan Cheng's house, banging on the door. Shuan Cheng's brother didn't have the night shift and was sleeping at home. He got up at this time and opened the door. Little Foreign Devil rushed straight in and broke open even the bolted door of Old Yin's room, shouting, "It's through! It's through!" Old Yin asked drowsily what was going on, but Little Foreign Devil grabbed a corn stalk and wanted to light a lamp, but he was so flustered that he couldn't light it. After a while, Old Yin understood and put on his clothes and ran off without waiting for the lamp to be lit.

When he arrived, there were hundreds of people at the mine, all crowded inside and outside the supply room, grabbing eggs and pancakes to eat. Little Foreign Devil punched and kicked his way in, grabbed two bites, and took some out to find Old Yin, but couldn't find him. It turned out that as soon as Old Yin arrived, he met Da San squatting outside the supply room eating a pancake. Da San lit an oil lamp and led Old Yin down the West Mine. As they walked down the mine, Old Yin asked, "Why is the oil lamp lit again?" Da San laughed, "The ventilation shaft is through, can't it be lit?" Old Yin unconsciously smiled foolishly, thinking: it seems he has rarely seen Da San smile!

Da San walked very fast, Old Yin followed closely, feeling a gust of small wind blowing all over his body, making him feel comfortable and energetic. At this time, they entered the ventilation shaft passage, first walking upright, then bending over, then crawling, and then, sure enough! They arrived at the East Mine! The terrain where the ventilation shaft passages dug from the east and west sides met was so appropriate, only the West Mine side was slightly higher by about a foot, and a climb would get you over. The wind was really strong at the opening where they met. The bottom of the mine was warmer than the outside, but it was unbearably cold here. Da San led Old Yin to quickly turn to the East Mine's upward passage, and Old Yin recognized the way. But he saw several stoves lit along the passage, and Da San told him, "Hunch over and walk fast!" He smelled a certain odor that choked people. After running out of the mine, Da San said, "The ventilation shaft just broke through, the soft and hard winds are stirring inside, it will be better after the fire smokes it." Old Yin still wanted to ask about the principle, but Little Foreign Devil ran over and stuffed half a pancake into his mouth, so he followed him to the supply room.

Fifty-Eight: Celebration

The rooster crowed three times, the sky dawned, and the mine workers who had stayed up all night slowly went home to sleep. But there were more and more people at the mine site. Somehow, neighboring village mine workers came to see, including people from three village blacksmith shops who were sent to order coal. They wanted 100,000 catties from this village, and 200,000 catties from that village, all anxiously shouting, "Now that the ventilation shaft is through, hurry up and get the coal out!" Xi Lu hadn't slept all night, but he was still slowly arguing with them about the price, and discussing how much coal to give to each village each day. Tian Lu was running non-stop up and down the mine, constantly telling people what the smell was like at the bottom of the mine. Old Yin and Shuan Cheng stayed at the mine site all day, and Old Bai also arrived, happily inspecting for a while. Lin Bao was busy all day disbursing supplies to people. The men, women, old and young in the village came in twos and threes, one group leaving and another coming. The women were no longer like they were ten years ago when the East Mine had just opened. They were all dressed cleanly now, crowding in groups at the mine site, gesticulating and chattering. The men also gathered around to joke with them. Little Foreign Devil went back to sleep for a while and then came back again, his mouth full of jokes, busy without stopping. At this time, it was also early March, and the white apricot blossoms had just bloomed on the slopes not far west of the big mine. Little Foreign Devil even went there to pick a handful and insisted that the women wear them. The women wouldn't wear them, but a tall mine worker ran up from the bottom of the mine, his face and hands covered in black soot. He snatched the apricot blossoms from Little Foreign Devil's hand and stuck them on the women's heads, scaring the women to run away, chattering like a flock of startled sparrows...

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（６２）
    康濯
    到点电石灯的第五天，东窑水也打干了，老尹并把分地的事作好了总结，去区里汇报了一下工作。第二天后晌，他回来后听说窑上没事，就没去窑场，谁也没找，只寻上几个发展党员的对象捣拉去了。但就在这时，东窑“七”跟前的味气突然厉害起来，人是实在呆不住，扁小跑上窑场，竟咳得腰也伸不直，大三急得抓起他的破礼帽直当扇子扇，好象这是六月炎天一般；后来拴成说：“没法！我看谁刨的，一人一班加一斤白面行不？反正也快了。”大三道：“我也早有这心思，就是一时不能开会民主讨论嘛！咳……老尹又没回！”拴成道：“这没什么！紧要关口嘛，以后再说吧！”小洋鬼却立时给传开了这讯息，牛宝头一个报名：“我算一个！＠他妈多日不见白面星星了！”接着也有几个报名的，还有象扁小和天禄，不要白面，又抢下去干，扁小并告大家：“下去了少往嘴里吸气，能多憋一会。”这么着，每个刨“七”的倒能呆个三几袋烟的工夫，刨“七”的并且乱了班，谁能刨就上去干两下，大三拴成也下了手。就这样乱七八嘈地动弹到半夜，看看窑场外面，天上三星正当头，忽地，东窑“七”没了！见炭了！两边人们说话也能听清了！两边镢头的音响，还震得人脑袋发疼！大三一马当先，自己刨开了炭，天禄也过西窑风筒顶头起下开了手；这时每下来一块炭，就听见镢头音响更大些，窑里窑外人们乱嚷道：“透啦！”“到头啦！”“这可再没说的啦！”大三却交代人们：“再使劲！沉住气！”也就是老半天又没音讯！后来叫明的雄鸡叫开了头遍，窑外人们心焦得又慢慢凉了，没事的窑黑也有想回去睡觉的了！正在这时，跟着一声鸡叫，窑底一阵吆喝：嘿！拴成是从东窑进去的，这会却从西窑口出来了！
    人们窑里窑外上上下下吱吱喳喳，大家乱问答着：“透啦？”“透啦！”“早透啦！”拴成嚷道：“烙白面饼炒鸡蛋！谁们掏钱？我掏二千！”喜禄乐得哆嗦着道：“我……我五千！”刹时间凑成了几万边币，也没点数，小洋鬼就连吆喝回家睡了的股东，带捎来一小篮子鸡蛋，直往柜房去；林宝追着叫道：“我来吧，你他妈不会作。”小洋鬼忙丢下鸡蛋跑出来说：“还不叫老尹？”拴成道：“他没回！”忽地有人记起老尹是回了，小洋鬼就撅着屁股，一口气跑到拴成家，一阵捶门，拴成他兄弟没夜班，在家睡着，这时起来开了大门，小洋鬼就直冲冲连老尹闩了的垦门也给端开，乱嚷：“透啦透啦！”老尹迷糊着问干什么，小洋鬼却找了根玉茭秸，想给点灯，但慌得怎么也点不着；一会，老尹闹清了，没等点灯就穿上衣裳跑了。
    等赶到，窑上却有了百十号人，大家正挤在柜房里外，使手乱抢鸡蛋烙饼吃；小洋鬼拳打脚踢冲进去，抢了两嘴，并拿了些出来找老尹，却找不见了。原来老尹一来，就碰见大三正圪蹴在柜房外边吃饼，大三便点起油扁领老尹下西窑去。他二人下窑走了一阵，老尹问道：“怎么油扁又点着啦？”大三笑道：“风筒透了，还点不着？”老尹不觉也傻笑起来，并想着：他好象从来就少见大三笑过的哩！
    大三走得很快，老尹紧跟着，只觉一阵阵小风吹得浑身舒展，吹得浑身带劲。这时他们走进了风筒行道，先是直着腰走，一会是哈着腰走，一会却得爬，再一会，可不！到东窑啦！那东西两边刨的风筒行道，碰头透通的地势是那么恰当，只西窑这边的些微高尺把，一爬就过来了。这碰头的口子上，风也真大；窑底本比外边暖和，这里却冷的不行，大三就领着老尹赶忙转到东窑朝外直上的行道，老尹认识道了。但他见到行道旁边，上下生了好几炉火，大三又告他：“哈着腰快走！”他便闻着一股什么味气，呛得人心发慌；赶跑出了窑，大三才说：“风筒刚透，软风硬风正在里边咯搅着，火薰一薰就好了。”老尹还想问问这道理，小洋鬼却跑来塞给了他半张饼，他就跟着去了柜房。
    五十八　庆祝
    鸡叫三遍，天明了，熬了夜的窑黑们这才慢慢回家睡觉去；但窑场上的人却一会比一会多；不知怎么这么快，邻村窑黑就有来看的，里边并有三个村铁炉上派来订炭的人，他们这村要十万斤，那村要二十万斤，都性急地嚷道：“风筒透啦就快出炭吧！”喜禄一夜没睡，这会却还是慢腾腾地跟他们急论价钱，讲说一天给各村多少炭；天禄是窑上窑下跑个不停，并不断告人们：窑底气味怎么样了；老尹拴成们更是整天没离窑场，后来老白也赶到了，高高兴兴地察看了一阵；林宝是一整天忙着给人们开支供应。村里男女老少更是三三两两，一班走了一班来，妇女们也不象十来年前东窑刚开成那样，她们现在都穿戴干净，一堆堆一伙伙挤到窑场上，指手划脚地喳喳闹着，男人们也便凑上去开开玩笑，小洋鬼回去睡了不大会就又来了，他更是满嘴耍笑话忙个不停；这时恰好又是三月初，大窑西边不远的坡坡上，白白的杏花刚开出来，小洋鬼还去那里摘来一把，硬要叫妇女们戴上，妇女们不戴，窑底却跑上来一个大个子窑黑，他满脸满手黑糊糊，从小洋鬼手上抢过杏花，就给妇女们头上插，直吓得妇女们乱跑起来，象一群受了惊的雀儿一般吱吱叫嚷……
