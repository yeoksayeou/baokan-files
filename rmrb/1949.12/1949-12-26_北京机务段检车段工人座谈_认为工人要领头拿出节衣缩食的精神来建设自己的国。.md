　　Beijing Railway Depot and Rolling Stock Depot Workers' Symposium
    Believing Workers Should Take the Lead in Displaying the Spirit of Thrift and Hard Work to Build Our Own Country.
    [Reported by this newspaper] Tianjin Railway Beijing Section workers, recognizing the nation's financial and economic difficulties, unanimously support the Financial and Economic Commission's handling of year-end double salaries or bonuses. To this end, the Beijing Railway Depot and the Beijing Rolling Stock Depot Workers' Union separately held symposiums. Workers at the Railway Depot said at the meeting, "The war is not over yet, and the farmers' lives are also very hard. It doesn't matter if we take a little less!" They also said, "The government's difficulties are everyone's business now, and we workers should take the lead in displaying the spirit of thrift and hard work to build our country." Workers at the Rolling Stock Depot thought about "what kind of days we were living last year at this time, and what kind of days we are living now" at the meeting. They believed: "We would be happy even if we didn't get anything now, let alone that the government is still taking care of us and giving us a portion!"

　　北京机务段检车段工人座谈
    认为工人要领头拿出节衣缩食的精神来建设自己的国。
    【本报讯】天津铁路北京段工人认识国家财政经济困难，一致拥护财经委员会关于年终双薪或奖金的处理办法。北京机务段及北京检车段工会为此分别召开了座谈会。工务段工人在会上说，现在仗还没打完，农民生活也很苦，少拿点儿不算啥！又说，现在政府困难是大伙儿的事，咱工人就应该领头拿出节衣缩食刻苦兴家精神来建设自己的国家。检车段的工人在会上想到“去年的今天过的是什么日子，现在过的是什么日子”。认为：“现在就是不给也痛快，何况政府还照顾咱给一部分呢！”
