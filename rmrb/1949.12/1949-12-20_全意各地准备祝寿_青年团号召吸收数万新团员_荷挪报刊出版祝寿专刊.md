Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: Comprehensive TASS news: After the Italian Communist Party Central Committee and the Italo-Soviet Association initiated the celebration of Stalin's 70th birthday, towns and cities throughout Italy are preparing for celebration meetings and lecture programs from the 17th to the 21st. Working people in towns and villages are constantly sending hundreds and thousands of congratulatory letters to Stalin. A grand celebration is scheduled to be held in Rome on the 18th. The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, will address the meeting. The Italian Communist Youth League launched a campaign to sign congratulatory letters to Stalin and promoted the "Stalin Enlistment Movement". The Youth League issued an appeal to the youth, calling for the absorption of tens of thousands of new members into the League on Stalin's birthday.
　　The working people of the Netherlands warmly congratulated Stalin on his birthday. The Dutch Communist Party's newspaper, De Waarheid, published an article by Schalker, a member of the Political Bureau of the Dutch Communist Party, and other articles expounding on Stalin's great role in building a socialist society. The progressive magazine "Voorwaarts" published a special birthday edition, which printed on the front page: "Glory to Stalin, under whose wise leadership, the Netherlands was liberated from Hitler's occupation." The magazine also published a prose poem by the famous Dutch poet Uris celebrating Stalin.
　　The Norwegian Communist Party's newspaper, Friheten, published a special article by Villok, Chairman of the Oslo Communist Party Municipal Committee, stating: "The victorious socialist construction of the Soviet Union has shown the way for all mankind. People all over the world, led by the working class and under the leadership of the Communist Party, should follow the example of the Soviet Union in order to achieve lasting peace, true democracy, and the happiness of the people. That is why we want to cheer for Stalin—the most outstanding leader of mankind. The twentieth century will be the century of Lenin and Stalin, the century of communism."

    【新华社北京十九日电】综合塔斯社消息：意大利共产党中央委员会和意苏协会在发起庆祝斯大林七十寿辰后，意大利全国各城镇均在准备自十七日至二十一日的庆祝会和讲演会节目，城镇和乡村的劳动人民，不断地向斯大林致成百成千件的祝贺信函。盛大的庆祝会定于十八日在罗马举行。意共总书记托里亚蒂将在大会上致词。意大利共产主义青年团发起在致斯大林贺信上签名的运动，并推行“斯大林入团运动”，青年团出发告青年书，号召在斯大林寿辰吸收数万新团员入团。
    荷兰劳动人民热烈祝贺斯大林寿辰。荷共真理报发表了荷共政治局委员夏尔克的论文及其他阐述斯大林在建设社会主义社会中的伟大作用的文章。进步的“前进”杂志刊行祝寿专刊，该刊在首页印着：“光荣归于斯大林，在他的明智领导之下，荷兰得以从希特勒占领之下解放出来。”该刊并发表了荷兰著名诗人乌里斯庆贺斯大林的散文诗。
    　挪威共产党机关报自由报刊载奥斯陆共产党市委会主席维洛克的专文称：“苏联的胜利的社会主义建设，为全人类指示了道路，全世界人民以工人阶级为首，在共产党的领导之下，应该追随着苏联的榜样，以获致持久和平、真正民主和人民的幸福。这就是我们为什么要向斯大林——人类最杰出的领袖——欢呼的缘故。二十世纪将是列宁和斯大林的世纪，是共产主义的世纪。”
