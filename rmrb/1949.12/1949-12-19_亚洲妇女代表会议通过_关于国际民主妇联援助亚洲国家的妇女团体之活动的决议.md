　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th.
　　The full text of the Asian Women's Representative Conference resolution on the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation to aid women's groups in Asian countries is as follows:
　　The First Asian Women's Representative Conference unanimously approves the movement to defend democracy and peace carried out by the International Democratic Women's Federation since its inception.
　　The International Democratic Women's Federation points out that the danger of US imperialism preparing for a third world war is threatening the whole world; it calls on all women to unite and fight to eliminate this danger; it calls on women to support the Soviet Union's peace proposals – due to these activities, it has strengthened the world peace camp. The declaration of the Second Congress of the International Women's Federation condemned those imperialists who want to expand their profits with the blood of the people and increase their bases of aggression all over the world; it condemned the anti-people wars they waged, whose only crime was that "they were unwilling to be slaves of foreign colonialists, to be masters of their own destiny, to fight for peace and freedom, and to hope that their children have food and happiness."
　　The International Democratic Women's Federation has supported all Asian women and their organizations who are fighting with the people for national independence and people's democracy.
　　The International Democratic Women's Federation leads women in all imperialist countries to fight against their own governments, demanding an immediate end to the colonial wars and armed interventions being carried out in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and South Korea.
　　The International Democratic Women's Federation has continuously launched movements to oppose the crimes of imperialists and their running dogs in colonial and semi-colonial countries in infringing upon human rights and democratic rights. For example, imprisonment without trial in Syria, Lebanon, and Iran, such as torture and arrests under the Nehru police who betrayed national interests in India.
　　The International Democratic Women's Federation has repeatedly protested in the United Nations against the suppression of women's democratic movements in many countries. The International Democratic Women's Federation has specifically accused the following in the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on Human Rights: unequal treatment of women in wages and occupations in all colonies and countries controlled by imperialism, especially in India and Iran, the absence of legislation protecting the social status of women, and the forced labor of women and children.
　　The investigation team sent by the International Women's Federation to Southeast Asia has promoted the progressive women's organizations in India, Malaya, and Burma to join the International Democratic Women's Federation, thus uniting them with all the women in the world who are fighting against the creators of poverty and war - imperialism.
　　The book "Women of Asia and Africa" published by the International Democratic Women's Federation has greatly helped us to understand the extremely cruel oppression suffered by women in those countries and their struggle for liberation. It has made people aware of the victorious battles of Chinese women, and how women in Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaya participated in their people's struggle for national independence. It shows the happy lives of women in the Soviet Asian Republics and the Mongolian People's Republic. The decision to convene the Asian Women's Representative Conference passed by the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation and later approved by the Second Congress in Budapest, and all the preparations for this conference, have aroused the greatest enthusiasm not only among women in Asia, but also among women in the colonies or semi-colonies of Africa and the Americas, as well as women in imperialist countries, and encouraged their common struggle against imperialism.
　　Due to these activities, the International Democratic Women's Federation has branches in fourteen Asian countries.
　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference requests the International Democratic Women's Federation to make preparations to establish an organization in Asia to strengthen the women's organizations in Asian countries and to make their relationship with the International Women's Federation closer.
　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference suggests to the International Democratic Women's Federation that it should make special efforts to widely disseminate the rich materials gained from the conference, so that the whole world can understand how women have participated in the national liberation movement and the strength that this movement brings to the camp of peace and democracy.
　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference proposes that March 8th International Women's Day be a festival for all women fighting for the right to a human life. The Asian Women's Representative Conference calls on the women of imperialist countries to support the demands of women in all oppressed countries while fighting for their own demands; and while opposing the preparation for a new war, to also strengthen their struggle for the immediate cessation of colonial wars and armed interventions.

　　亚洲妇女代表会议通过
    关于国际民主妇联援助亚洲国家的妇女团体之活动的决议
    【新华社北京十八日电】亚洲妇女代表会议关于国际民主妇联援助亚洲国家的妇女团体之活动的决议，全文如下：
    第一次亚洲妇女代表会议一致赞成国际民主妇联创立以来所进行的保卫民主和平运动。
    国际民主妇联指出美帝国主义准备第三次世界大战的危险正威胁着全世界；它号召所有妇女团结起来，为消除这危险而斗争；它号召妇女支持苏联的和平建议——由于这种种活动，它加强了世界和平阵营。国际妇联第二次代表大会的宣言，谴责了那些想用人民的血来扩大他们的利润并且在全世界增加他们的侵略基地的帝国主义者；它遣责了他们所进行的反人民的战争，而这些人民唯一的罪过是“不愿意做外国殖民者的奴隶，要做自己命运的主人，为和平自由而战斗，希望他们的孩子有饭吃而且幸福”。
    国际民主妇联曾支持了所有和人民一起为民族独立与人民民主而斗争的亚洲妇女和她们的组织。
    国际民主妇联领导所有帝国主义国家的妇女向本国政府进行斗争，要求立刻停止在越南、印尼、马来亚、缅甸以及朝鲜南部所进行的殖民战争与武装干涉。
    国际民主妇联不断的发动运动，来反对帝国主义者及其走狗在殖民地半殖民地国家内侵犯人权和民主权利的罪行。例如在叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊朗的不经审判的监禁，例如在印度的背叛民族利益的尼赫鲁警察之下的酷刑与逮捕。
    国际民主妇联数度在联合国组织内抗议许多国家对妇女民主运动的镇压。国际民主妇联曾在联合国妇女情况委员会和人权委员会中特别指责：在所有殖民地及为帝国主义所控制的国家内，特别是在印度和伊朗，在薪金和职业方面对妇女的不平等待遇，保卫妇女的社会地位的立法之不存在，以及妇女及儿童的强迫劳动。
    国际妇联派到东南亚的调查团曾促成印度、马来亚和缅甸的进步妇女组织加入国际民主妇联，从而使她们和全世界一切为反对贫困与战争的制造者——帝国主义而战斗着的妇女联合起来。
    国际民主妇联所发表的“亚洲与非洲的妇女”一书，曾大大的帮助了我们明了在那些国家内妇女们所遭受的极其残酷的压迫和她们求解放的斗争。它曾使人认识中国妇女胜利的战斗，以及越南、印尼、缅甸和马来亚的妇女如何参加他们人民争取民族独立的斗争。它使人看到苏联亚洲共和国和蒙古人民共和国妇女的幸福生活。在国际民主妇联执委会上通过，并且后来为布达佩斯二次代表大会所批准的关于召开亚洲妇女代表会议的决定与这一会议的一切筹备工作，不仅在亚洲的妇女中，而且在非洲、美洲的殖民地或半殖民地的妇女以及帝国主义国家内的妇女中，都曾经引起最大的热情，并且鼓励了她们反对帝国主义的共同斗争。
    由于这种种的活动，国际民主妇联已经在十四个亚洲国家中有他的分会。
    亚洲妇女代表会议提请国际民主妇联进行筹备在亚洲建立一个机构，来加强亚洲各国的妇女组织，并使她们与国际妇联之间的关系更加密切起来。
    亚洲妇女代表会议向国际民主妇联建议，请它特别努力广为传播会议所收获的丰富的材料，以便使全世界明白妇女们如何参加了民族解放运动以及这运动所带给和平民主阵营的力量。
    亚洲妇女代表会议提议使三八国际妇女节成为一切妇女争取人的生活权利而斗争的节日。亚洲妇女代表会议要求帝国主义国家的妇女在为自己的要求而斗争时，同时也支持所有被压迫国家内妇女的要求；在反对新战争的准备时，同时也加强她们的争取立刻停止殖民战争与武装干涉的斗争。
