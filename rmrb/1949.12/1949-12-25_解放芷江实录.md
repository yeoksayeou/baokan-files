　　A True Record of the Liberation of Zhijiang

    The troop laboriously descended from the summit of Tuobapo (the high mountain behind Zha Niu Ping) in a sea of white clouds, looking from afar like a long centipede. Arriving at Huang'ao, the soldiers, finding it to be the campsite, were a little surprised, as this was the first time since departing from Chenxi that they had camped after traveling only seventy-seven li.
    The troops halted by the small river at the foot of the mountain to await allocation of housing. Some soldiers closed their eyes and leaned against the rocks, relaxing their weary muscles. Suddenly, the cavalryman from the command post, snorting all the way, galloped past the left side of the slope, stopping by the stone where the regimental commander and political commissar were sitting. "What's the matter? – That cavalryman!" someone muttered.
    A few minutes later, the regimental headquarters summoned cadres at the company level and above for a meeting. Immediately after, while ordering the cooks of each company to start cooking dinner, they announced the order just received from the command post: the enemy intended to withdraw from Zhijiang, and our troops were to rush to Zhijiang tonight to capture and annihilate them. As everyone knew, Zhijiang was one of the four major Kuomintang air force bases in the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren revolted, the bandit leader Huang Jie set up the puppet Hunan provincial government here. More importantly, the Kuomintang reactionaries dreamed of maintaining a remnant foothold in the Southwest, forming a final line of resistance against the People's Liberation Army from Ganzhou and Hengyang in the east to Shaoyang and Zhijiang in the west. Although Ganzhou had been captured by another unit of our army, the reactionaries still dreamt of struggling. If we were to capture Zhijiang this time, it would cut off the White bandits' westward route and open the way for our army to advance into Guizhou and Guangxi; this task was significant and glorious.
    After the regimental commander conveyed the order, the comrades all shouted excitedly. Some said, "As long as there is a battle to fight, who would patiently wait here for food? It's not as if we've never eaten before!" Others said, "If we eat and the enemy runs away, that wouldn't be worth it!" Then, thousands of voices shouted together! "Advance, advance!… Depart immediately! We'll only eat after we've taken Zhijiang." Here, the regimental leaders carefully considered that it was seventy li from Huang'ao to Zhijiang. The soldiers had eaten at four in the morning and then crossed mountains and ridges on an empty stomach to make a surprise attack on the enemy, and they were afraid that their physical strength would not be able to handle it. However, the soldiers' will was firm, their only hope was to catch up with the enemy and prevent them from escaping, so they had to depart immediately.
    Then, a rare commotion arose in the ranks. Everyone shouldered their weapons, and by the time they were about to depart, it was already six o'clock in the afternoon. After climbing over two high ridges and exiting the mountain gorge, the Southwest Highway lay horizontally facing the Bian River Mountain. For days, the soldiers had been climbing cliffs and precipices, where the roads were no more than two feet wide and terribly rugged. Suddenly seeing the highway, their joy was hard to imagine. The ranks all cheered, their steps becoming particularly vigorous, shouting in unison: "As long as we can fight the enemy, and there is a highway, we can walk another one hundred and forty li without eating, let alone seventy." The highway was filled with a burst of rain-like footsteps, and the mighty ranks surged toward Zhijiang like waves of the Bian River, with no one willing to fall behind by half a step.
    When the troops were less than twenty li from Zhijiang, the Ninth Company's task was to bypass the town and head straight for the airport. Deputy Company Commander Yin Tongyou took the lead, and a line of strong backs quickly left the highway under the dim moon shrouded in thick clouds, swiftly walking along the foothills on the left, disappearing into the vast wilderness in the blink of an eye.
    The Fifth Company continued to advance. When they saw the town gate, the point man reported the situation ahead. The first platoon leader ordered the soldiers to spread out on the spot in a three-line formation, preparing to seize the West Gate Bridge. The fields were quiet, and apart from the rushing sound of the Yuan River, nothing else could be heard. But the soldiers were tense, eager for the opportunity to make meritorious contributions that was now about to arrive. Suddenly, a shot rang out in the sky, instantly shattering the quiet night. Then came bursts of dense light machine gun fire, and the battlefield immediately became lively.
    Every soldier had a burning desire to kill the enemy. Subsequent troops closely followed the assault platoon towards the town gate. Although bandit leader Huang Jie had led his minions to flee south in a panic when Zhijiang East was surrounded, the remnants of the First Security Regiment and the Second Security Regiment, who remained in the town, desperately used the crossfire of their machine guns to block the bridge. The attacking troops were enraged, immediately mobilized our heavy machine guns and mortars, organized firepower, and then bombarded the enemy. Then, they roared in a charging formation. In less than a cup of tea's time, the bridgehead was captured, and all the enemy defending the bridge were annihilated.
    The sound of gunfire spread quickly from west to east into the city, later followed by silence. The troops entering the city immediately joined forces with the Ninth Company, which was attacking the airport, and escorted the whole batch of prisoners, shells, and other ammunition spoils out of the city. At half past six on the morning of October 3rd, this so-called last line of defense fortress of the Kuomintang bandit army - Zhijiang, was completely liberated by the People's Liberation Army.

　　解放芷江实录
    蒋牧良
    队伍从白茫茫的云里面艰苦地爬下驼板坡（扎牛坪背后的大山）的高峰，远看真好象一条长长的百脚虫。来到黄拗便是宿营地，战士们大家有些奇怪，仅仅走了七十七里便宿营，这是从辰溪出发以来的第一次。
    部队停止在山下的小河边上等待分配屋子，有的战士就闭上眼睛靠着岩石，疏散疲劳以后的筋骨。忽然指挥所那个骑兵的马，一路喷着鼻子，打山坡左侧掠过，一到团长和政委坐的石头旁边，就停住了。“什么事？——那骑兵！”不知谁在咕噜。
    几分钟以后，团部召集了连以上干部谈了话，接着就一面吩咐各连的炊事员马上烧饭，一面宣布了刚才从指挥所来的命令：敌人有撤出芷江的企图，咱们的队伍今夜要奔到芷江去抓住敌人把他们消灭，只等吃了晚饭使要出发。谁都知道芷江是抗日战争后期国民党四大空军基地之一，程潜陈明仁两将军起义以后，匪首黄杰便把湖南伪省府设在这里。尤其重要的是国民党反动派梦想保持西南残局，东起赣州衡阳，西至邵阳芷江，构成一条抵抗人民解放军的最后防线。虽然赣州已被咱们的另一路大军攻下，但反动派还梦想挣扎，如果咱们这一回攻下芷江，一方面截断了白匪的西进之路，同时也给我军进军黔桂开辟了道路；这任务是重大的，同时也是光荣的。
    团长把命令传达过后，同志们都哇啦哇啦的叫了起来，有的说：“只要有了仗打，谁还耐心在这里等饭吃？饭又不是没有吃过的。”有的又说：“吃了饭，跑了敌人，那才不值得哩！”接着便有千百道声音一齐喊！“出发出发！……马上出发！咱们要打下芷江才吃饭。”在这里，团首长就很用心的考虑着，黄拗到芷江还有七十里，战士们清晨四时吃了饭便翻山越岭，空着肚皮奔袭敌人，恐怕体力有些吃不消。然而战士们的意志是坚决的，唯一希望是要追上敌人，别让他们逃了，非立刻出发不可。
    接着，队伍里起了一阵稀有的骚动，大家背起了武器，临到出发的时候，已是下午六点钟了。爬过两个高岗，出了山峡，西南公路就横躺在便水山面。几天来战士们爬着悬崖断壁，道路不上两尺宽，而且崎岖得可怕，忽然看到公路，那高兴的情形叫人难以想象。行列里全都欢呼起来，步子拉得格外起劲，异口同声地喊：“只要能够打上敌人，又有公路，不吃饭再叫咱们走上一百四也行，别说七十里。”公路上一阵骤雨似的步子，浩荡的行列便水浪样的直向芷江涌去，谁也不肯落后半步。
    队伍进到芷江不满二十里的地方，第九连的任务是绕过城关直扑飞机场，副连长尹同友带头，一行健壮的背影在厚云笼罩的淡月底下迅速地抛开公路，沿着左边的山麓向前疾走，一闪眼儿工夫，消失在苍茫的原野上了。
    第五连继续向前挺进，等到望见城关，尖兵报告了前面的情况，一排长便叫战士们就地成三线式散开，准备抢夺西关大桥。四野里静悄悄的，除了沅江有着奔放的水声，其余什么也听不见。可是战士们的心情紧张了，自己渴望着立功的机会现在快要到来。猛的，一响枪声划过天空，静夜立刻给撕破了，接着便是阵阵挤密的轻机枪响，战场上马上变得热闹起来。
    每一个战士都有着杀敌的狂热，后续部队紧接着突击排奔向城关，匪首黄杰虽在芷东受到包围时就率领喽罗们狼狈南逃，但留在城厢的警备第一团，保安第二团的残部，还是拼命用机枪的交义火力封锁大桥。进攻部队冒火了，立刻调集了咱们的重机枪和迫击炮，组织好火力，然后对敌轰击。接着是冲锋式狂叫起来，不到一盏茶时，桥头阵地给夺下了，守桥的敌人全部被消灭。
    枪声自西而东，很快地发展到了城里，后来便是寂静，入城部队立即会合进攻飞机场的第九连，把整批的俘虏、炮弹、还有弹药等战利品解出城来，在十月三日的清晨六时半，这一座国民党匪军的所谓最后防线的堡垒——芷江，就给人民解放军全部解放了。
