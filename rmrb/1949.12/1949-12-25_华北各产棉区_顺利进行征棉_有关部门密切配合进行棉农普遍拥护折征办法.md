　　Major Cotton-Producing Areas of North China
  　Cotton Procurement Proceeding Smoothly
  　Relevant Departments Closely Cooperate; Cotton Farmers Universally Support the Tax-in-Kind Method
    [By Our Newspaper] Since the North China People's Government, in order to guarantee the interests of cotton farmers, facilitate cotton farmers' payment of taxes, and supply raw materials for the textile industry, decided to use a reasonable proportion of cotton as tax-in-kind this autumn, the Ministry of Finance, North China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, and North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative jointly formulated an agreement, defining the coordination methods of the three systems in cotton procurement; and stipulated that each jin of standard seed cotton should be converted into three jin and seven liang of millet, and cotton procurement stations should be set up in major cotton-producing areas. The cooperative is responsible for cotton grading, weighing, accounting, ginning, and storage. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for pre-event publicity, education for cadres and farmers, and supervision, inspection, and protection during collection, as well as necessary assistance to the cooperative; the cotton collected is entirely transferred by the cooperative to the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, and the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company pays the cooperative all the cotton seeds and a 3% handling fee of the cotton procurement quantity as storage and processing costs, and then the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company settles accounts with the Ministry of Finance uniformly. Afterwards, provinces, special districts, and counties held collection meetings to arrange work. Representatives' conferences were held at all levels to discuss autumn collection work and make allocations within each region. Reduction quotas for disaster-stricken villages were decided, and the cotton procurement decision was thoroughly communicated.
    Work began in various places in late November. Because of the thorough publicity and education in advance, cotton farmers felt that listening to the government this year and planting cotton was indeed much better than other crops, so they were willing to pay more cotton to help the country develop its industry. Recently, some areas, such as Ding County, have completed more than half of their collection tasks, and it is expected that most areas will complete all tasks in the near future.

　　华北各产棉区
  　顺利进行征棉
  　有关部门密切配合进行棉农普遍拥护折征办法
    【本报讯】自前华北人民政府为保证棉农利益，便利棉农纳赋税和供给纺织工业原料，决定今年秋征以合理比例折征一部棉花后，财政部、华北花纱布公司、华北供销合作总社等三单位即成立协议，定出三系统在征棉中的配合办法；并规定每斤标准籽棉折合小米三斤七两，在各产棉区普设征棉站。由合作社负责棉花分级、过秤、算帐、轧榨、保管等。财政部负责事前对干部、农民宣传、教育和征收时督促检查、保护以及对合作社必要的协助；征得棉花，由合作社全部移交花纱布公司，由花纱布公司付给合作社以全部棉籽和征棉数量百分之三的手续费作为保管加工费用，然后再由花纱布公司与财政部统一算帐。其后各省、专区、县都举行征收会议，布置工作。并普遍举行各界代表会议，讨论秋征工作并作出各区内分配数字。及受灾村的减征数量，并对征棉决定作了深入的传达。
    到十一月下旬，各地工作即开始，因事前宣传教育深入，使棉农都感到今年听了政府话种了棉，果比别的庄稼强得多，因此都愿意多交棉花以帮助国家发展工业。到最近有些地区如定县已完成征收任务的半数以上，预计大部分地区在最近期内即可完成全部任务。
