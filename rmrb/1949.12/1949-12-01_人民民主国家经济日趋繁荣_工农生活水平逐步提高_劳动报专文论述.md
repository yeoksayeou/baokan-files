　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: Babinqing wrote an article in Labor Daily describing the gradual improvement of the living standards of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the People's Democratic countries. The article stated: The gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural standards is a law of development in the People's Democratic countries. The victorious completion of economic plans, the increase in labor productivity, and the expansion of economic relations with other countries, especially the Soviet Union, have guaranteed the continuous increase in national income of the People's Democratic countries. In Poland, the national income in 1948 exceeded the pre-war level, reaching 18 billion zlotys (Polish currency), and is expected to reach 21.2 billion zlotys this year. The national income of the People's Democratic countries is distributed according to the interests of consolidating the national economy and the interests of the working people. In Czechoslovakia and Poland, this year's expenditures for social services and cultural development will account for one-third of the entire budget, while in Bulgaria, it will reach 20 percent of the budget. The governments of the People's Democratic countries, in order to improve the people's lives, have resolutely abolished the rationing system for food and manufactured goods and have reduced prices. In Budapest, the consumption of bread, milk, and sweets has increased threefold compared to 1947, and meat has increased twofold. In the month after the abolition of rationing, bread consumption increased by one-third. In Poland, the sales volume of state-owned and cooperative stores in the third quarter of this year increased by 80 percent compared to the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the sales volume of cream and cotton fabrics increased by nearly one-half, and meat increased fourfold.
    The governments of the People's Democratic countries have taken various measures to ensure the continuous increase in the real wages of the working people. In Czechoslovakia, wages have exceeded the pre-war level by 40 percent. In Hungary, the real wages of industrial workers exceed the pre-war level by 37 percent, Bulgaria by 25 percent, Poland by 20 percent, and in Romania, real wages increased by 22 percent in 1948 alone. The welfare of farmers has also improved significantly. Thanks to state aid in machinery, loans, and seeds, agriculture has recovered from the disasters of war and poor harvests. This year, there have been widespread bumper harvests everywhere.
    The author pointed out that the workers and staff members in the People's Democratic countries are different from those in capitalist countries. In addition to wages, they also receive social insurance, free medical care, and paid annual leave. Huge amounts of money are allocated for education, municipal and housing construction, and maternal and child welfare. Taking housing construction in Poland as an example, by the summer of this year, approximately 18 million cubic meters of buildings had been repaired and constructed in Warsaw. In the past year alone, a total of 70 million cubic meters of living space in 39,000 houses were repaired. In the countryside, 200,000 houses were repaired in a short period of time thanks to state loans. The scale of workers' residential construction this year is one and a half times larger than last year. The slums, remnants of the old regime, have long disappeared.
    The People's Democratic countries, drawing on the experience of the Soviet Union, have implemented comprehensive national social insurance. In Romania, 2.5 million people enjoy social insurance. In Poland, the number of people covered by insurance, including their family members, reaches 8 million. Huge amounts of money are allocated for the recuperation expenses of the working people, the establishment of more sanatoriums and rest homes, and summer resorts for the children of employees. The governments of the People's Democratic countries are vigorously improving the people's culture, and science and art are being enjoyed by all the people for the first time in history. Schools and higher education institutions are increasing. The doors of universities and research institutes are open to the children of workers and peasants. Universal compulsory basic education has been implemented. To facilitate the entry of the children of the working people into higher education institutions, many workers' supplementary schools have been specially established. The number of intellectuals from the people is increasing day by day.

　　人民民主国家经济日趋繁荣
  　工农生活水平逐步提高
  　劳动报专文论述
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯莫斯科讯：巴宾顷在劳动报撰文描述人民民主国家的工人、农民与知识分子生活水平的逐步提高。该文称：人民的物质与文化水平的逐步提高，是人民民主国家发展的规律。经济计划的胜利完成、劳动生产率的增加、与其它国家首先是苏联的经济关系的扩大，保证了人民民主国家国民收入的不断增加。在波兰，一九四八年国民收入已超过战前而达一百八十亿兹罗提（波币），今年更达二百十二亿兹罗提。人民民主国家的国民收入是按照国民经济的巩固的利益和劳动人民的利益而分配的。在捷克斯洛伐克与波兰，今年用于社会事业与文化发展的费用，将为整个预算的三分之一，在保加利亚，则达预算的百分之二十。人民民主国家的政府为谋人民生活的改善，坚决取消了食品与制成品的配给制，并且减低了价格。在布达佩斯，面包、牛奶和糖果的的消费量，较一九四七年增加了三倍，肉类增加了两倍，在配给制取消后一个月，面包的消费量就增加了三分之一。在波兰，国营与合作社商店的销售量，今年第三季较去年同季增加了百分之八十，今年上半年奶油与棉织品的销售量增加了将近二分之一，肉类增加了四倍。
    人民民主国家的政府采取种种措施，保证了劳动人民实际工资的不断提高。在捷克斯洛伐克，工资业已超过战前水平百分这四十。在匈牙利，产业工人的实际工资超过战前水平百分之三十七，保加利亚超过百分之二十五，波兰超过百分之二十，在罗马尼亚，仅一九四八年实际工资就增加了百分之二十二。农民的福利也有了显著的改善。由于国家在机器、贷款和种子方面的援助，农业已从战争与歉收的灾害中过来。今年各地普遍丰收。
    作者指出，人民民主国家的工人和职员跟资本主义国家是不同的，他们除了工资之外，还得到社会保险，免费的医药和一年一度的工资照付的假期。巨大的款项拨充教育、市政与房屋建筑及妇婴福利之用。以及波兰的房屋建筑为例，到今年夏天，在华沙业已修复建造了约一千八百万立方公尺的建筑物，仅在去年，就修复了总共七千万立方公尺居住面积的三万九千所房子。在农村里，由于国家的贷款，在短期内修复了二十万所房舍。今年工人住宅建筑的规模较去年大一倍半。旧政权的遗物贫民窟，早已消失了。
    人民民主国家吸取苏联的经验，实行了包罗一切的国家社会保险。在罗马尼亚，有二百五十万人享有社会保险，在波兰，获得保险的人连同他们家属在内，数达八百万。巨大的款项拨充劳动人民的疗养费，增设疗养院和休憩所，以及职工子弟避暑处所之用。人民民主国家的政府大力提高人民文化，科学与艺术有史以来第一次为全体人民所享有。学校和高等教育机关，正在增加。大学和研究院的大门为工农的子弟敞开。普遍的强迫的基本教育业已实行。为了便于劳动人民的子弟进入高等教育机关，特别开办了许多工人补习学校。来自人民中的知识分子，其数天天在增加中。
