　　Ideological Remolding Examples
    (Edited by Zi Yan, price 2750 yuan)
    Ideological remolding is an urgent requirement for every progressive young person today. Remolding ideology requires effort in many ways, and reading actual examples of ideological remolding often plays a greater role than simply reading theoretical articles. This book contains a selection of sixteen stories about ideological remolding. Most are stories of model cadres from the old liberated areas, including technicians from intellectual backgrounds, labor heroes, medical workers, and rural teachers. At the end of the book, six articles by famous authors discussing ideological education, criticism, and self-criticism are included as an appendix. Reading the stories and then the essays can have a mutually reinforcing effect. The entire book is 140,000 words long. It is excellent reading material for college and high school students, government cadres, and general professional youth. It is especially suitable as a supplementary reading material for political classes in secondary schools.
