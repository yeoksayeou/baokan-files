Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: According to TASS reports: On the eve of Stalin's seventieth birthday, the Czechoslovak Free Publishing Bureau published the second and third volumes of the Czech version of Stalin's Collected Works, each with 100,000 copies. Other Czech and Slovak publishing bureaus published books, selections, and pamphlets narrating Stalin's life and activities, and printed various pictures of Stalin; published many murals about Czech-Soviet friendship; and published many works by Soviet writers and works written by Czech and Slovak writers and poets for the best friend of the Czechoslovak people - Comrade Stalin.

　　To celebrate this birthday, factories and manufacturing plants in the Czechoslovak Republic are launching socialist emulation drives and shock work on an increasingly large scale, and are organizing "Stalin shift systems" to strive for high labor efficiency. On December 15, the employees of "Svit," the largest enterprise in light industry, completed the plan for the first year of the Five-Year Plan. To celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday, the workers of this enterprise continue to compete and produce goods exceeding the plan. In the factories of the Liveles district, the shock workers of the "Stalin shift system" exceeded their predetermined targets by 500%, 600% or even more than 600%.

　　Albanian newspapers continue to publish many congratulatory letters to Stalin. These letters were written by workers, farmers, students, soldiers, housewives, and mothers who sacrificed their children for the national liberation war. The working people celebrate this memorable festival by planting lush green trees. Thirty thousand trees have been planted in the four suburbs of Tirana, and the citizens of Vlora have planted 23,000 trees. Lectures on Stalin's life and deeds are held throughout the country. Exhibitions specifically displaying Stalin's life and works have been held in various cities and troops and have already closed.
