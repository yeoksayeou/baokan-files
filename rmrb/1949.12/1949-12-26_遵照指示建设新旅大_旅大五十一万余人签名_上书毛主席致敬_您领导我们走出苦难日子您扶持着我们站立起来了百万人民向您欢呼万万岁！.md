Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, December 25th: People from all walks of life in Lüda launched a campaign before November to sign a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their respect. A total of 516,600 people from all walks of life signed the letter in their own handwriting. This huge letter of respect was written in regular script on a whole bolt of red satin, and has been accepted by Ouyang Qin, secretary of the CPC Lüda District Committee, for forwarding to Chairman Mao. The full text of the letter of respect is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

In your solemn announcement, the People's Republic of China was founded. The Chinese people have since entered a new era. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by you, our people are striding forward in the great direction you have indicated: to build a prosperous and strong new China. With unparalleled jubilation and enthusiasm, the million people of Lüda extend to you our highest respect and most sincere love, and wish you boundless longevity.

Chairman Mao, the people of Lüda were directly under the enslavement of Japanese imperialism for forty long years, trampled upon and unable to hold our heads high. The Japanese invaders tortured to death our elders, ravaged our generation, and viciously attempted to make our younger generation ignorant of their motherland. The suffering endured by the people of Lüda in these forty years is too much to describe or recount. In order to oppose the evil rule of Japanese imperialism and its agents in China—feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and other traitorous running dogs—the people of Lüda waged heroic struggles. And you, and the Communist Party of China under your leadership, have always stood at the forefront of the struggle for the interests of our people. Therefore, during these long days of suffering, the people of Lüda, like the broad masses of people in other parts of China, placed their hopes on you and the Communist Party of China under your leadership.

In the era when you led the people of the whole country in carrying out a vigorous anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist revolution, the people of Lüda, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, broke through the strict guard of the Japanese invaders and carried out struggles such as demonstrations in support of the Shanghai Incident, the great strike of the Fukushima Textile Factory, and anti-imperialist parades and rallies. When the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and slaughtered the Chinese people, Japanese imperialism also cooperated with the Chiang bandits to carry out mass arrests and mass repression against the people of Lüda. In the days of the "September 18th" Incident and thereafter, although the people of Lüda suffered more cruel torture and more difficult lives, because we could still see your bright red flag and clearly hear your call and encouragement for heroic struggle, we still actively supported the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, and were concerned about the land revolution movement in Guannei, and carried out many anti-imperialist and anti-Chiang struggle activities. In the years after 1937, the Japanese invaders' rule over Lüda became even more severe, and the suppression became even more cruel. The people of Lüda were squeezed to the point of suffocation and devastated to the point of not being able to live. However, even in such days, because you and the Communist Party of China under your leadership were bravely and resolutely leading the people of the whole country in the War of Resistance Against Japan, although we were facing increasingly difficult and bitter times, we also saw the dawn of victory more and more clearly, and we were increasingly filled with the hope and confidence of turning ourselves around.

　　遵照指示建设新旅大
　  旅大五十一万余人签名
　  上书毛主席致敬
    您领导我们走出苦难日子您扶持着我们站立起来了百万人民向您欢呼万万岁！
    【新华社大连二十五日电】旅大各界人民曾在十一月以前，发动了一个签名向毛主席上书致敬的运动。各界共有五十一万六千六百余人亲笔签名。这封巨幅的致敬书是用整匹红缎楷书写成的，已由中共旅大区党委书记欧阳钦接受代转给毛主席。致敬书全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在您庄严的宣告中，中华人民共和国成立了。人民的中国从此进入了新的纪元。我们全国人民在以您为首的中央人民政府领导下，朝着您所指示的建设一个繁荣昌盛的新中国的伟大方向健步迈进。我们旅大百万人民满怀无可比拟的狂欢与热情，特向您致最崇高的敬意，最衷心的爱戴，并祝福您万寿无疆。
    毛主席，我们旅大人民曾经在四十年之久的岁月中直接处于日本帝国主义奴役之下，被践踏得抬不起头来。日寇曾经折磨死了比我们年长的一辈，曾经蹂躏了我们这一代，又曾经恶毒地企图使我们年青的一代不知有祖国。我们旅大人民在这四十年中所遭受的苦难，是说也说不完，诉也诉不尽的。为了反对日本帝国主义及其在中国的代理人——封建主义、官僚资本主义等汉奸走狗们的罪恶统治，我们旅大人民曾进行了英勇的斗争；而您以及您所领导的中国共产党，则始终为我们人民利益站在斗争的最前列。因此，在这长长的苦难日子里，我们旅大人民和中国其他地区广大人民一样，都把希望寄托在您以及您所领导的中国共产党方面。
    在您领导着全国人民进行轰轰烈烈的反帝反封建大革命的时代里，我们旅大人民也曾经在中国共产党的领导下，冲破日寇统治的严密警戒，进行过声援沪案示威、福岛纺织厂大罢工、反帝游行集会等等的斗争。国民党蒋介石叛变革命，屠杀中国人民的时候，日本帝国主义也曾经配合蒋贼，向旅大人民进行过大逮捕、大镇压。“九、一八”及其以后的日子里，旅大人民虽然遭受着更其残酷的折磨与更为苦难的生活，但是因为我们还能一直看到您这幅鲜明的红旗，清楚地听见您英勇斗争的号召与鼓励，我们仍积极地支援过东北抗日联军，并关心着关内土地革命运动，与进行过反帝反蒋的许多斗争活动。在一九三七年以后的数年里，日寇对旅大的统治更是严厉了，镇压得更为残酷了，旅大人民被压榨得透不过气来，摧残得简直活不成了。但是，即使在这样的日子里，我们旅大人民还是因为有着您以及您所领导的中国共产党在英勇坚决地领导着全国人民进行抗日战争，因此，当时我们虽是越过越艰难困苦，但是我们也越过越看到胜利的曙光，越过越使我们充满着翻身出头的希望和信心。
