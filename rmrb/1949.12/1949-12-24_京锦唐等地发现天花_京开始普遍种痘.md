(Beijing News) According to the Municipal Health Bureau, smallpox cases have recently been discovered in Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, and Tangshan areas. Recently, one case has also been discovered in the inner three districts of this city. In order to prevent external invasion and spread, the bureau has mobilized 60 epidemic prevention staff members (including doctors), divided into 20 groups, to first implement vaccination within the boundaries of the inner three districts, and then gradually extend to other districts. The vaccination targets are divided into three types: (1) newborns; (2) new residents moving in from outside the city; (3) citizens who have not been vaccinated for more than two years. This work began on the 21st, and it is scheduled to complete the vaccination work in the three districts within five days. At the same time, all municipal medical institutions are also providing free smallpox vaccinations for citizens during daily outpatient hours.
