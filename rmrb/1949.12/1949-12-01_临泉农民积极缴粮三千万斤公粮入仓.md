　　Linquan Farmers Actively Deliver 30 Million Jin of Public Grain to Granary

[Our Newspaper] Encouraged by the victorious struggle against bandits and local bullies, farmers in Linquan County, Northern Anhui, enthusiastically delivered grain, successfully storing over 30 million jin of public grain. Since the end of October, families in various localities have been busy sewing grain bags, sunning threshing baskets, and preparing vehicles of all sizes. At the beginning of this month, when districts successively announced the start of tax collection and storage, the masses enthusiastically carried and transported grain, with most townships completing storage within a day. The reason for the masses' enthusiastic grain delivery is the result of the development of the anti-bandit and anti-hegemon movement and the correct implementation of the reasonable burden policy. After the public trial and execution of bandit leader Zhang Da in Huangdazhuang, Li Zhuang Township, Wadian District, the masses' political awareness generally improved, and farmers' associations in various villages guaranteed that autumn grain would be delivered quickly and well, without a single grain owed. Yu Wanqing, a farmer in Chengguan District, said: "This time everyone is united. After the government took the lead in shooting bandit leader Wang Lao Jiu and overthrowing bandit leader Sun Zhigeng, the farmers felt like two stones had been removed from their bodies, so they were happy to deliver grain. We delivered it quickly ourselves and also automatically monitored the landlords' deliveries."
