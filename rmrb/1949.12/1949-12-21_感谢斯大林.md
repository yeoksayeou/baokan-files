　　Thank You, Stalin
    Asian Women's Congress, Czechoslovakian Women's Delegation Anna Herodekova
    When the Hitler-led Fascism seized power in Germany, Czechoslovakia's neighbor, everyone knew that the Czechoslovak Republic was facing danger. Because Fascism meant war, and at that time, it meant a war of aggression against our country. Because the foreign policy of the Czechoslovak government, then in the hands of the bourgeoisie, was dependent on Western capitalist countries, and it had signed military alliance treaties with France and Britain.

    Between 1933 and 1938, news friendly to the Soviet Union was censored, and Communist Party members who attempted to introduce the truth about life in the early socialist society were persecuted or imprisoned. But the people of Czechoslovakia understood that danger was knocking on Czechoslovakia's door, so public opinion pressured the government to sign a military (mutual assistance) treaty with the Soviet Union. The Czechoslovak government, in order to please the Czechoslovak bourgeoisie, insisted that this treaty could only be fulfilled under the following condition—that a similar treaty be signed with Germany.

    In 1938, the Munich Agreement was signed, and Britain and France shamelessly violated their promises and encouraged Hitler to invade Czechoslovakia. At this time, it was the Soviet Union, led by Stalin, that offered military assistance to the people of Czechoslovakia. But the government, controlled by reactionary landlords, went against the will of the people and refused this assistance. In 1938, Hitler invaded part of Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 annexed the whole of Czechoslovakia. In the League of Nations in Geneva, among the representatives of many countries, only one representative came out to protest and declare that the Munich Agreement would not and would never be recognized by the country he represented. This representative was the Soviet representative, Litvinov.

    After six years of occupation, in 1945, the Czechoslovak Republic was liberated by the Red Army. Shortly after liberation, the Red Army military authorities handed over power to the Czechoslovak government, which had been established before the national liberation.

    We thank Comrade Stalin and the Red Army, because they enabled our country to begin building our new country, our industry, and transportation in the days immediately following liberation. Our people worked hard to repair everything that had been destroyed during the German occupation and the Second World War. During the German occupation, nearly half a million people lost their lives. Men, women, and even children were imprisoned by the Fascists in concentration camps, suffering cruel torture. The economic losses to our country were also very heavy.

    Therefore, the Czechoslovak people will always remember that it was the Soviet Union, led by Comrade Stalin, that liberated us and restored our freedom to us.

    In 1947, Czechoslovakia's food production was very low due to a nationwide drought. At that time, everyone knew that there was not enough grain. Because the German Fascists had looted almost everything during the war, there were no reserves. The reactionary elements in the West hoped that our government would be forced to accept the Marshall Plan, which had been rejected once before.

    At Czechoslovakia's most critical moment, it was again the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin who came to our aid, supplying our people with grains, butter, and meat. This made it possible to restore normal food rations.

    Now that Anglo-American imperialists are threatening the world with new wars of aggression, it is again the Soviet Union, this great and powerful bastion of peace and democracy, that is strengthening the security of the peace-loving people of the world and enabling the people of the people's democratic countries to have the opportunity to improve their economic lives. The Czechoslovak people are convinced that only through close cooperation with the Soviet Union can our country be spared from being dragged into war.

    These reasons explain why every Czechoslovak will wholeheartedly celebrate Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday.

    During the birthday celebration week, our people will hold conferences and commemorative days in cities, villages, factories, and mining areas. To celebrate Marshal Stalin's birthday, more than one million new members will join the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Association. In the past three months, women's organizations have held lectures to all women, explaining the significance of Stalin's teachings to Czechoslovak women.

    Our cities and villages are decorated with flags and portraits. In factories and other sectors, workers have increased their productivity, and a large number of shock workers have emerged for the glory of Stalin. Farmers are producing more grain for the country. Young people have organized many labor teams, working voluntarily on new highways and railways.

    All of this is to congratulate this great man. He is our teacher, instructing us on how to organize socialism in our country, how to ensure that all working people have a safe, happy, and superior life. We want to celebrate Marshal Stalin's birthday. He is a great friend and protector of our Czechoslovak people and nation.

### 感谢斯大林

　　感谢斯大林
    亚洲妇代会、捷克妇女来宾  安娜·荷第罗娃
    当以希特勒为首的法西斯主义在捷克的邻国德国握权之后，每一个人都知道捷克共和国是面临着危险。因为法西斯主义的意思就是战争，而在当时来说，就是侵略我们国家的战争。因为当时掌握在资产阶级手里的捷克政府的外交政策是依附于西方资本主义的国家，它和法国，英国订立了军事同盟的条约。
    在一九三三年至一九三八年间对苏联友好的新闻都被检查掉，而尝试于介绍在初期社会主义社会生活真相的共产党党员们都被迫害或者被监禁了。但是捷克的人民懂得危险是在叩着捷克的大门，所以群众舆论压迫着政府要和苏联订立军事（互助）的条约。捷克政府为了讨好捷克的资产阶级，坚持必须要在下面的条件下才能履行这个条约——就是要和德国签订一个同样的条约。
    在一九三八年，签订了慕尼黑协定，英法卑鄙地违背了他们的诺言，而鼓励希特勒去侵占捷克。这个时候向我们捷克人民提供军事援助的就是斯大林所领导的苏联。但是在反动的地主掌握中的政府违背了人民的意志，拒绝了这个援助。一九三八年希特勒侵占了捷克的一部分，一九三九年并吞了全捷克。在日内瓦的国际联盟里，许多国家代表中只有一个代表出来抗议并且声明慕尼黑协定不会得到、而且永远也不会得到他所代表的国家的承认。这一个代表就是苏联的代表，李维诺夫。
    经过了六年的占领，在一九四五年，捷克共和国被红军所解放了。在解放后不久，红军军事当局就将政权交回给在全国解放前就成立的捷克政府。
    我们感谢斯大林同志和红军，因为他们使得我们的国家能在解放后的几天当中就开始建立我们的新国家，我们的工业和交通事业。我们的人民尽力地工作来修复在德国占领期中和二次大战中所破坏的一切。在德国占领期中差不多有五十万人民丧失了他们的生命。男子，妇女，甚至小孩都被法西斯分子关在集中营中，受着残酷毒刑的摧残。我们国家经济的损失也是很重的。
    所以，捷克人民将永远记得：是斯大林同志所领导的苏联解放了我们，而将自由还给了我们。
    在一九四七年，捷克的食品生产由于全国的旱灾，产量很低。那个时候每一个人都知道粮食是不够的。由于在战争时期德国法西斯分子几乎掠夺了一切，没有任何的储藏。西方的反动分子希望着我们的政府会迫得无法而接受已被拒绝过一次的马歇尔计划。
    在捷克最危急的时候，又是苏联和斯大林同志出来援助我们，供给我们的人民以五谷、牛油和肉类。这样一来，使得食物的配给恢复正常。
    现在当英美帝国主义者用新的侵略战争威胁着世界，又是苏联，这个伟大的，强大的和平和民主的堡垒，出来加强世界上爱好和平人民的安全，并且使得人民民主国家的人民能够有机会来进行改善他们的经济生活。捷克人民深信，只有和苏联密切合作，才能使我们的国家免于卷入战争。
    这些理由说明了为什么每一个捷克人都将全心全意地来庆祝斯大林大元帅的七十寿辰。
    在祝寿周中，我们的人民要在各城市，各乡村，工厂，和矿区等举行大会，及纪念日。为了庆祝斯大林大元帅的生日，将有一百万以上新的会员参加捷苏友谊协会。在最近的三个月中，妇女组织向所有的妇女举行演讲会，向她们解释斯大林的教诲对捷克妇女的意义。
    我们的城市，乡村用旗帜画片装饰起来。在工厂里及其他部分，工人增加了他们的生产率而且为了斯大林的光荣有大批的突击队员涌现出来。农民们替国家生产出更多的粮食。青年人组织了许多的劳动队，义务地在新的公路上和铁道上工作。
    所有这些，都是为了祝贺这一位伟人。他是我们的导师，指示我们如何在我们的国家里组织社会主义，如何使得所有的劳动人民得到安全，幸福和优越的生活。我们要庆祝斯大林大元帅的寿辰。他是我们捷克人民和国家的伟大朋友和保卫者。
