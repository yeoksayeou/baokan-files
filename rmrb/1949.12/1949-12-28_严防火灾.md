　　Strictly Prevent Fires
    Since the beginning of winter, there have been continuous fires in Beijing. From December 1st to now, there have been as many as twenty-two incidents, causing great losses to the wealth of the country and the people. Necessary steps must be taken to eradicate this, and it should not be allowed to continue.
    Examining the reasons for these fires, there are several aspects. Some managers of government agencies and enterprises take an irresponsible attitude towards national wealth, and there is still a bureaucratic style of work. Management organizations and systems are lax, discipline is lax, fire safety equipment is inadequate, and they are usually negligent in prevention and inspection. Once an accident occurs, they are flustered and even fail to report to the fire brigade immediately. Among the citizens, the great harm of fire has not aroused sufficient vigilance and prevention. Ordinary citizens generally do not have fire-fighting equipment, and some do not even know the telephone number of the municipal fire brigade. What should be especially vigilant is the sabotage of Kuomintang secret agents and bandits. The incident in which the Beijing Tram Factory burned down fifty-nine trams was one of the criminal acts of the secret agents and bandits.
    Therefore, in order to protect the wealth of the country and the people from destruction and loss, we must wage a resolute struggle against all paralyzing thoughts. We must conduct regular fire prevention education in factories, government agencies, schools, and among the broad masses of the people, so that everyone realizes that protecting the property of the country and the people is everyone's sacred duty. At the same time, we must establish a strict inspection system, and properly place and regularly check stoves, old wires, easily combustible dry items, etc. We must also establish fire prevention organizations, set up necessary fire-fighting tools, and immediately implement fire fighting once a fire occurs, and quickly report to the fire brigade to avoid the spread of the fire. In addition, we should be highly vigilant against those secret agents and bandits who destroy national property, prevent them from taking the opportunity to sabotage, and report them to the People's Government in time after discovering the evidence of their sabotage, and severely suppress them, so that they will no longer continue to do evil.

　　严防火灾
    入冬以来，北京市不断发生火灾，从十二月一日迄今已达二十二起之多，使国家和人民的财富遭受了很大的损失。必须采取必要步骤，予以根绝，决不应再让它继续发生。
    检查这些火灾所以会酿成的原因，有几个方面。有些机关、企业的管理人员，对国家财富采取不负责的态度，还存在着官僚主义作风，管理组织和制度松弛，纪律弛废，防火安全设备不周，平时疏于防范检查，一旦发生事故，则手忙脚乱，甚至不立时报告消防队。在市民中间，对火灾危害之大亦未引起足够的警惕和防止，一般市民均无消防设备，甚至有的连市消防队电话号码都不知道。尤其应该警惕的是国民党特务匪徒的破坏，前此北京市电车厂焚毁电车五十九辆的事件，便是特务匪徒们的罪恶行为之一。
    因此，我们要保护国家和人民的财富免受破坏损失，必须向一切麻痹思想作坚决斗争；在工厂、机关、学校及广大市民中经常的进行防火教育，使大家认识到保护国家和人民的财产，是每个人的神圣职责。同时，要建立严格的检查制度，对炉火、破旧电线，容易燃烧的干燥物品等，均应妥为放置并经常检查。还要建立防火组织，设置必要的防火工具，一旦发生火警，立即施行扑救，并迅速报告消防队，避免火灾蔓延。此外，对那些破坏国家财产的特务匪徒，应引起高度警惕，防止其伺机破坏，当发现其破坏实据之后，应及时向人民政府告发，予以严厉镇压，再不让他们继续为非作恶。
