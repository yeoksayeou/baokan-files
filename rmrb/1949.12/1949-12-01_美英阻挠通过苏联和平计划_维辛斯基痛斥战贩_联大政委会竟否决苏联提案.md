Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 30th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly’s Political Committee discussed and voted on November 23, 24, and 25 on the Soviet proposal to condemn preparations for a new war, for the five major powers to conclude a pact to strengthen peace, and to prohibit atomic weapons and control atomic energy. At the same time, it discussed and voted on the so-called "Essentials of Peace" proposal put forward by the US and Britain.

　　In order to obstruct serious discussion of these important proposals by the Soviet government aimed at protecting the interests of hundreds of millions of people around the world, the US-British bloc launched a discussion at the meeting that had nothing in common with the Soviet proposals. However, the solemn speeches by representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of the US-British bloc. During the three-day meeting, Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered successive speeches, each lasting several hours, vehemently attacking the shameless clamoring of the US-British bloc. Some countries acting as echo chambers for the United States, such as the representatives of Chile, Lebanon, and Venezuela, attempted to distort the great theory of Marx and Lenin that war is an inevitable result of the capitalist system, claiming that the Soviet Union had no sincerity in maintaining peace. Vyshinsky explained the ignorance and shamelessness of this malicious slander.

　　Soviet Peace Pact Aims to Eliminate Hotbeds of War

　　Vyshinsky pointed out at the 24th session: The idea of Communism is the idea of eliminating war. The Soviet Union's goal is to eliminate all hotbeds of war, contain the forces of war and prevent war, and this is the socialist program. It is untenable to say that it is illogical for the Soviet Union to condemn the US-British ruling bloc for preparing for war on the one hand, and to propose concluding a peace pact with these countries on the other. The Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a pact to strengthen peace with these countries is precisely because the US, Britain, and some other countries are preparing for a new war. This Soviet proposal is a call to the people of all countries to do their best to stop war preparations. The United States and Britain are now refusing to conclude a peace pact, saying that the peace pact proposed by the Soviet government would almost cancel the UN Charter, which is ridiculous. On the contrary, this pact would be a concrete realization of the principles set out in the Charter. The Political Committee must support this Soviet proposal.

　　At the 25th session, Vyshinsky refuted the French representative's slander against the Soviet Union distorting historical facts, saying: The French representative eloquently questioned here: "Where was the Soviet Union when Hitler attacked France in 1940?" Has the French representative forgotten the history of the negotiations between representatives of Britain and France in Moscow from March to May 1935? Has he forgotten the fact that France and Britain sent minor representatives without proper authority to Moscow for negotiations? This fact fully proves that the French and British governments had no interest in conducting negotiations, the purpose of which was to conclude an agreement between the Soviet Union, France, and Britain to jointly defeat the attack that Hitler had already prepared at that time. Didn't the French representative know that Lloyd George said at that time that "Chamberlain, Halifax, and Simon were unwilling to conclude any agreement with the Soviet Union"? When Hitler was preparing to attack France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union proposed concluding an agreement with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly defeat Hitler's aggression, but was rejected. At that time, the negotiations between the British and French representatives and Marshal Voroshilov in Moscow were just a smokescreen on the part of Britain and France, while Hitler and the representatives of Chamberlain and Daladier were sincerely colluding behind this smokescreen.

　　Vyshinsky pointed out that there are enough facts that can be cited, all of which are irrefutable and proven to be true by historical documents. If the French representative intends to discover the slightest honesty, he should look up the booklet titled "Falsifiers of History" published by the Soviet Information Bureau. He will find his own portrait in that booklet, because what he said here is also falsifying history. Those things that were very clear to Lloyd George were equally clear to the heads of Hitler's Germany, that is, the British and French governments were unwilling to conclude a defensive alliance with the Soviet Union against Hitler's aggression. They had ulterior motives and wanted to urge Hitler to attack the Soviet Union as soon as possible, and to make the Soviet Union fight Germany under conditions of discord, as a reward for Hitler launching this attack.

　　Vyshinsky continued: Does the French representative not know that when the Hitler government suggested to the Soviet Union the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty under these circumstances, the Soviet Union agreed to this treaty. The Soviet government, with Marshal Stalin, the head of state, gave an explanation of this in his epoch-making speech on July 3, 1941. At that time, he explained in detail to the Soviet people the conclusion of this treaty. Whether in drafting or signing this treaty, we never doubted for a moment that Hitler would break the treaty and attack us. But we needed to buy time to prepare for retaliation, to prepare to defeat the Hitler gang, to prepare for the battles of Stalingrad and Berlin, and to save France and the entire world from Hitler's shackles. The French representative should at least have a little basic decency, not forget these facts, and not ask this provocative question of his.

　　Striving to Implement Soviet Proposals Will Be Carried Out in the UN General Assembly

　　Vyshinsky's speech made representatives of many countries had to admit that the Soviet proposal helped realize the lofty ideals stipulated in the UN Charter. But they contradictorily claimed that they still could not vote in favor of the Soviet proposal. When voting, as expected, the Soviet proposal was rejected by the usual US-British majority. However, when voting separately on the various parts of the Soviet proposal, as many as twenty-six countries abstained from voting, unwilling to cast votes that were not from their hearts, including Argentina, Colombia, Cuba, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Up to fourteen countries voted in favor of the various parts of the Soviet proposal, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador, Guatemala, the Philippines, Israel, Uruguay, and Yemen. The United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Turkey voted against all parts of the Soviet proposal aimed at strengthening peace. In this way, the US-British bloc prevented the UN General Assembly from adopting the Soviet plan to maintain peace.

　　Subsequently, this US-British bloc majority passed the so-called "Essentials of Peace" proposed by the US and Britain. This proposal is a mixture of vague and empty statements, spreading harmful and dangerous "ideas" such as restricting national sovereignty. After the vote, Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech explaining why the Soviet delegation abstained from some parts of the US-British proposal and voted against other parts. He said: I would like to explain that we abstained from voting on these clauses because the passage of these clauses only repeats the clauses already included in the UN Charter, without adding anything. The purpose of including these clauses in the draft proposal is to cover up some other clauses in this proposal that aim to legalize activities that systematically undermine the UN Charter. This activity is frequently carried out by the US-British bloc in the United Nations.

　　The Political Committee's discussion of the Soviet proposal thus came to an end. The struggle to achieve the Soviet peace plan will be carried out in the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　美英阻挠通过苏联和平计划
  　维辛斯基痛斥战贩
    联大政委会竟否决苏联提案
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十一月二十三、二十四、二十五三日，讨论并表决了苏联所提关于谴责新战争准备、五强缔结加强和平公约与禁用原子武器并管制原子能的提案，同时讨论并表决了美英所提所谓“和平要义”的提案。
    美英集团为了阻挠苏联政府旨在保护全世界亿万人民利益的这些重要建议的认真讨论，在会上发动了与苏联提案毫无共同之处的讨论。但是苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克代表严正的发言，彻底暴露了美英集团的阴谋。在三天会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基连续发表每次长达数小时的演说，痛击美英集团的无耻叫嚣。若干作为美国应声虫的国家，如智利、黎巴嫩、委内瑞拉的代表，妄图把马克思、列宁主义关于战争是资本主义制度不可避免的结果的伟大学说，歪曲为苏联没有诚意维护和平。维辛斯基说明这种恶毒诽谤的无知与无耻。
    苏联和平公约目的在于消灭战争温床
    维辛斯基在二十四日会议上指出：共产主义的观念就是消灭战争的观念。苏联的目的是消灭一切战争的温床，遏止战争势力和防止战争，这就是社会主义的纲领。说苏联一方面谴责美英统治集团准备战争，另一方面又提议与这些国有缔结和平公约是不合逻辑的行动，这是毫无力量的。苏联提议与这些国家缔结加强和平的公约，正是因为美、英及其它一些国家在准备新的战争。苏联的这个建议是号召一切国家的人民，尽力阻止战争准备。美国和英国现在拒绝缔结和平公约，说苏联政府所提的缔结和平公约，将差不多是取消联合国宪章，这种说法是可笑的。相反，这个公约将是宪章所定原则的具体实现。政治委员会必须支持苏联的这个建议。
    维辛斯基在二十五日会议上驳斥法国代表歪曲历史事实的对苏诽谤称：法国代表曾在这里花言巧语地诘问：“希特勒一九四○年进攻法国时，苏联在什么地方呢？”法国代表是否已经忘了一九三五年三月——五月在莫斯科与英法代表谈判的历史呢？是否他已经忘了法国与英国派了毫无适当权力的次要代表到莫斯科来进行谈判这件事实呢？这件事实充分证明法、英政府对进行谈判毫无兴趣，而这个谈判的目的在缔结苏、法、英共同击败当时希特勒已经准备好的进攻的协定，难道法国代表不知道劳合·乔治在那时会说过“张伯化、哈立法克斯和西门都不愿意与苏联缔结任何协定”的话吗？在希特勒已准备攻法国、英国和苏联时，苏联曾提议缔结英、法、苏共同击败希特勒侵略的协定，但是遭到了拒绝。那时英、法代表与伏罗希洛夫元帅在莫斯科进行的谈判，不过是英、法方面的一种烟幕，希特勒与张伯伦及达拉第的代表们则在这个烟幕后真诚地狼狈为奸。
    维辛斯基指出，有足够的事实可以引用，这些事实都是不可驳斥的，并且为历史文件证明属实，如果法国代表有意发现最起码的诚实的话，他就应当去翻翻苏联情报局所出的题名“历史伪造者”的小册子。他将要在那本小册子里找到他自己的画像，因为他在此间所说的也是伪造历史。那些对于劳合·乔治很明白的事情，对于希特勒德国的头子也同样是很明白的，这就是说，英国和法国政府都不愿意与苏联缔订反对希特勒侵略的防御联盟，他们别具居心，想要催促希特勒尽快进攻苏联，并使苏联在不和的条件下对德国作战，以此作为对希特勒发动这次进攻的报酬。
    维辛斯基继续说：法国代表难道不知道，当希特勒政府在这种情况下向苏联建议缔结不侵犯条约时，苏联同意了这个条约。苏联政府，元首斯大林大元帅在其一九四一年七月三日划时代的演说中对此曾作了解释。那时他向苏联人民详尽地解释了这个条约的缔结，无论是在起草这个条约或是签字的时候，都没有使我们有一刻怀疑过希特勒一定会毁弃条约进攻我们。但是我们需要争取时间，以备还击，准备击溃希特勒匪帮，准备斯大林格勒与柏林的战役，挽救法国和整个世界摆脱希特勒枷锁。法国代表至少也应该有点起码的体面，不忘记这些事实，不发出他这个挑衅性的问题。
    争取实现苏联建议将在联大全会进行
    维辛斯基的发言，使得许多国家的代表不得不承认苏联提案有助于实现联合国宪章中规定的崇高理想。但他们却矛盾地声称仍然不能投票造成苏联的提案。在进行表决时，正如人们所预料得到的一样，苏联提案被照例的美英多数所否决。但是在分别表决苏联建议的各个部分时，因不愿投非出于本心的票而弃权的代表多至二十六国，其中包括阿根廷、哥伦比亚、古巴、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、巴基斯坦等国。投票赞成苏联建议各个部分的代表，多至十四国，其中包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、厄瓜多尔、危地马拉、菲律宾、以色列、乌拉圭和也门等国。美国、英国、法国、比利时、荷兰和土耳其等对苏联旨在加强和平的建议的一切部分，都投反对票。美英集团就这样阻止联大通过苏联维护和平的计划。
    随后，这个美英集团多数又通过了美英所提的所谓“和平要义”。这个提议是含混而空洞的声明的混合物，散布了诸如限制各国家主权这样有害的和危险的“思想”。在投票结束后，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表演说，解释苏联代表团为什么对美英建议的若干部分弃权和对其它部分投反对票。他说：我愿意说明在表决这些条文时我们之所以弃权，是因为通过了这些条文只是重复联合国宪章已经包括了的条文，而无所增益。把这些条文包括在建议案的草案内的目的，是要掩饰这个议案内其他一些旨在使有系统地破坏联合国宪章的活动成为合法的条文。这种活动是美英集团经常在联合国在进行的。
    政治委员会对苏联提案的讨论，就这样结束了。争取实现苏联和平计划的斗争，将在联合国大会全体会议上进行。
