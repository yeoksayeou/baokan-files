    Celebrating Marshal Stalin's
    Seventieth Birthday Special Issue
    The entire venue erupted in shouts of "Hurrah!" and thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. This fully demonstrates the Soviet people's high level of support and love for their great leader. It also fully expresses the spirit of unity among all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. This is one of the most important factors in the immense power of the Soviet socialist state.

    The marching crowds flowed by continuously. The slogan "Long live Comrade Stalin!" seemed to resonate especially loudly in Red Square. And Red Square seemed to become even redder and brighter!

    Someone in our ranks said loudly: Look! Stalin's brilliance illuminates Red Square! Everyone around him heard his voice, and they all smiled, looking at the brilliantly illuminated Red Square, looking at the brilliantly enthusiastic marching masses, and in their hearts they were saying:

    Stalin's brilliance illuminates Moscow!
    Stalin's brilliance illuminates the entire Soviet Union!
    Stalin's brilliance illuminates the whole world!"

    庆祝斯大林大元帅
    七十寿辰专号
    全场高呼“乌拉！”掌声如雷，历久不息。这足见苏联群众对自己的伟大领袖拥护爱戴的高度的热情。这里也就充分表现了苏联全国各族人民团结一致的精神。——这是苏维埃社会主义国家力量强大无比的最主要因素之一。
    群众游行的队伍不断地流过去。“斯大林同志万岁！”的口号似乎特别震响在红场上。而红场也就似乎变得更红更亮了！
    我们队伍中间有人高声地说：看呀！斯大林的光辉照耀着红场！周围的人都听到了他的声音，大家脸显笑容，眼望着光辉灿烂的红场，望着光辉热烈的游行的群众，心里且都在说：
    斯大林的光辉照耀着莫斯科！
    斯大林的光辉照耀着全苏联！
    斯大林的光辉照耀着全世界！”
    一九四九年十二月十五日
