　　Unified Leadership of Literary and Art Work; Launching a Whole-Army Creative Movement: Decision Made by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 27th) The Political Department of the Fourth Field Army recently issued a "Decision on Strengthening Literary and Art Work in the Troops," summarizing the experience of the department's past literary and art work and stipulating the guiding principles and methods for future literary and art work.

　　In the three years of the People's Liberation War, the department's literary and art work implemented the principle of "serving the soldiers," playing a very important role in improving the troops' political awareness and cultural level, enlivening the troops' life, and inspiring and consolidating combat will. However, there were still some shortcomings and biases in the work, such as: (1) the principle of serving the soldiers in the troops' literary and art work has not become a universal, systematic, and fully conscious ideology of all literary and art workers; (2) the whole army's literary and art work lacks unified leadership and planned construction; (3) insufficient promotion and encouragement of creation; (4) lack of criticism and self-criticism in literary and art work, etc.

　　In order to promote the past advantages of the troops' literary and art work and to strictly and effectively correct the shortcomings and biases, the Political Department, based on the spirit of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers and the specific circumstances of the troops' literary and art work, made several decisions.

　　First, all departments should regard the troops' literary and art work as an important task to encourage fighting spirit, stimulate emotions, raise awareness, enliven troops' life, and spread good conduct and traditions. We must learn from the experience of the Soviet army, give due attention to the troops' literary and art work, and not only let a few literary and art cadres do it, or only pay attention to adjusting the lives of a few people.

　　Secondly, the following specific tasks should be carried out to strengthen the troops' literary and art activities:

　　(1) Launch a creative movement throughout the army, encouraging comrades with ideological and creative abilities to engage in drama, song, dance, and other literary and art creation. Give creators time, help them collect materials, provide opinions, and appropriately combine individual creation with collective creation. Successful and educational works should be rewarded and introduced for performance throughout the army.

　　(2) Review existing works (including dramas, operas, living newspapers, yangko dances, dances, drum songs, etc.), and either adopt the good or better works in their original form, or make additions and changes to make them more perfect.

　　(3) Strive to train literary and art talents, first of all, writers, directors, and actors, improve their theoretical and artistic level, and relatively guarantee the specialization of their work. Do not easily transfer the work of personnel in cultural work troupes, propaganda teams, and literary and art work cadres.

　　(4) Increase the funds for troops' cultural activities and literary and art work: establish the ranks of literary and art workers, implement a performance appraisal system, and those with excellent performance should be given preferential treatment.

　　Finally, regarding the organization and leadership of the whole army's literary and art work, the propaganda teams above the army level will be renamed as a certain army's cultural work troupe, with 80 to 100 members, whose main task is to do literary and art work, conduct creation and research, and give demonstration performances to divisions and regiments; the division and regiment propaganda teams will still be called propaganda teams, with the division propaganda team composed of 50 to 60 people and the regiment propaganda team composed of 30 to 40 people, whose task is to carry out literary and art activities and performances in the troops, especially to assist in carrying out the singing movement in the companies, and to carry out propaganda to the masses; under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Central China Military Region and the Fourth Field Army Political Department, a whole army literary and art work committee will be established to lead the whole army's literary and art work.

　　统一文艺工作领导开展全军创作运动
　  四野政治部作出决定
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】第四野战争军政治部日前发布了“加强部队文艺工作的决定”，总结了该部过去文艺工作的经验，并规定了今后该部文艺工作的方针和进行办法。
    该部文艺工作在三年人民解放战争中，贯彻了“为兵服务”的方针，对于部队政治觉悟、文化水平的提高、部队生活的活跃和战斗意志的激励与巩固，都起了很重要的作用。但在工作中还存在着若干缺点和偏向，如：（一）部队文艺工作为兵服务的方针还没有成为所有文艺工作干部普遍的、有系统的、完全自觉的思想；（二）全军文艺工作缺少统一的领导和有计划的建设；（三）对创作的提倡和鼓励不够；（四）文艺工作缺少批评和自我批判等。
    为了发扬该部队文艺工作过去的优点，并对于缺点和偏向进行严格有效的改正，该政治部根据全国文代大会的精神和该部队文艺工作的具体情况，作出若干决定。
    首先，各部应把部队文艺工作当作鼓励斗志，鼓励情绪，提高觉悟程度、活跃部队生活与传播优良作风和优良传统的一项重要工作来看待。必须学习苏联军队的经验，对于部队文艺工作给予应有的重视，不能只让少数文艺干部去作，或只注意调剂少数人的生活。
    其次，应进行下列几项具体工作，以加强部队的文艺活动：
    （１）在全军范围内展开创作运动，鼓励有思想有创作能力的同志，从事戏剧、歌曲、舞蹈及其他文艺创作。给从事创作者以时间，并帮助他们搜集材料，提供意见，并使个人创作与集体创作适当地结合起来。对于成功而具有教育意义的作品，应予奖励，并介绍在全军内上演。
    （２）审查已有的作品（包括话剧、歌剧、活报、秧歌、舞蹈、大鼓等），对于好的或较好的作品，或原版采用，或给以增改，使更加完美。
    （３）努力培养文艺工作人材，首先是培养写作者、导演和演员，提高其理论水平与艺术水平，并相对地保证其业务的专门化。对文工团、宣传队的人员和文艺工作干部，不轻易调动他们的工作。
    （４）增加部队文化活动的费用与文艺工作费用：订定文艺工作人员的等级，实行考绩制，成绩优良者，应从优待遇。
    最后，关于全军文艺工作的组织与领导，军以上的宣传队改称某某军文工团，团员八十人到一百人，主要任务是做文艺工作，进行创作和研究，到师、团作示范演出；师、团的宣传队仍称宣传队，师宣传队由五十人到六十人，团宣传队由三十人到四十人组成，其任务是在部队中展开文艺活动和演出，特别是协助开展连队的演唱运动，并对群众进行宣传；在华中军区、第四野战军政治部宣传部领导下，成立全军文艺工作委员会，领导全军文艺工作。
