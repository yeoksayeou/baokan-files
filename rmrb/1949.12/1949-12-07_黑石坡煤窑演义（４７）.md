The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (47)
    Kang Zhuo

　　Big Three stood up, waving his hat, suppressing his voice and saying, "Okay, Old Bai, you're right! I just didn't realize it!" As he said this, he slammed the hat on his head, waving his arms, his voice rising again, and he shouted freely, "I'm wrong! But I, Zhang Yuanlu, also know that it's our own world now. Old Yin didn't talk to me much, and I've heard it more than once in meetings! Everyone thinks highly of me, chose me to open the kiln, and let me work hard, I'll do it! But shouldn't you all think about it too?..." Big Three seemed very angry, so Liugou's family kept pointing at him and yelling, "Can't you sit down and talk properly? Look at your attitude! How can you explain things clearly like this! Oh dear, I've never seen anyone like you..." Little Foreign Devil was so anxious that his short legs were jumping back and forth, sighing, "What's the point of saying this! Alas, this this this... another black family delayed... Alas, Uncle Big Three, can't you take a break and speak slowly? Alas..." Shuan Cheng approached Big Three, took his arm and said, "Uncle Big Three! You're right, we have shortcomings in our work and towards you. Whatever you want to say, tell us! Give us your suggestions to help us!" Bian Xiaolin, Bao Little Foreign Devil and Liugou's family and others, all surrounded Big Three, all saying that they had shortcomings, asking Big Three to point them out, and persuading him to calm down and think about opening the kiln; only Tai Cheng sat by the stove, looking down at the fire, smoking non-stop, saying nothing. Here Big Three suddenly pushed everyone away, his feet "thump thump thump" walked straight to the bunk inside and sat down, lowered his head and said, "I really have a lot of opinions!" People all came over to ask him to speak, but he pushed everyone away again, "thump thump thump" walked to Old Bai and said, "I have to talk to you first. Old Bai, I'll go back first, you sleep at my place tonight!" He turned his head and said: "Everyone! Let's make this mistake one more time! We'll talk about the kiln tomorrow." After saying that, he turned and left.

　　The people in the room were speechless one by one. Tai Cheng stood up and said, "Let's not discuss it anymore! We can go!" He left. Xilu looked at everyone, and said with a grin, "Comrade Yin, Comrade Bai, Shuan Cheng! You all work hard, persuade Big Three well! We're going back too!" He also left. The people who were left sat around the stove, talking about Big Three; some were talking about what they knew about Big Three, some were reviewing their work and themselves, some were talking about their opinions on Big Three, and later they discussed how to help Big Three... They talked until almost three stars were overhead, and agreed to have another cadre meeting the next morning, then they all dispersed. At the end, Old Bai also talked to Old Yin for a while, then followed Tianlu to sleep at Big Three's place.

　　Forty-Two Enlightenment

　　The next day, Old Yin and the cadres went to the temple early, intending to continue discussing the work that had not been planned yesterday; but Old Bai did not come, and Little Foreign Devil went to call him once, but he came back alone, saying, "He doesn't pay any attention to me, he just keeps yelling at Big Three! I don't know what he's yelling about!" Old Yin couldn't help but mutter to himself again, thinking that these worker-peasant cadres have a stable working stance, but most of them have low culture, no plans or systems, and do things according to their own temper: this is really a problem. Old Yin blinked his eyelids and thought for a while, then told Shuan Cheng and Lin Bao to settle the distribution of fruits at the temple, and he pulled the other cadres to Big Three's house to find Old Bai.

　　It turned out that after Big Three returned last night, he had been sitting and waiting for Old Bai; when Old Bai came, the two started drinking. In the middle of drinking, Old Bai asked, "Don't you have something to say? Speak!" But Big Three still didn't say anything, just drinking big mouthfuls in silence. Old Bai's anger had subsided at this time, so he didn't say anything, just leaned back on the kang, watching Big Three's two big eyes turning red while drinking, thinking about mobilizing and educating the workers, when the wine was finished, the three stars in the sky were setting in the west, and both of them were a little drunk, so they both fell asleep. This morning, Big Three woke up and pushed Old Bai awake, saying, "We didn't finish our conversation yesterday! Get up, get up and listen to me." Old Bai lay in the quilt, yawning and said, "Just say it like this!" Big Three sat on the edge of the kang, first saying that his past failure to seek out the Eighth Route Army and his lack of proactivity after liberation were indeed mistakes; then he said: when that man surnamed Wu came to lead the emancipation in the spring, how could such a person be considered a Communist? Hua Da Lao Yin is much better, but he can't even lead the opening of a kiln. He doesn't understand the kiln, and he doesn't bother to find someone to ask about it. Instead, he lets these kiln owners who have been in this place for thousands of generations bear the brunt! Furthermore, Old Yin treats him, Big Three, he doesn't know why, he doesn't let him participate in the poor peasant group, leaving him, a worker who has nothing, far away, but he lets muddleheaded people like Little Foreign Devil and Liugou's family be elected as cadres! Even Shuan Cheng, although he is indeed good, but since he started working, he rarely looks for him... Finally, he said, "I accept all my mistakes. But what I said above..." Old Bai had been listening with wide eyes, and at this time he suddenly sat up, without putting on his clothes, and interrupted Big Three, saying, "You're still just complaining about others! I say, are you considered an old worker? Are you considered our old comrade?" Big Three looked at Old Bai, his mind went blank, knowing that this person was angry again, so he hurried away to squat on the ground, thinking to himself: how did this person become even worse than me! Here, Old Bai put on his clothes, got off the kang and walked around for a while, then said: "I'm not right to be angry! But I can't help but... I said Big Three, we are workers! The working class! Don't you remember what I used to say to you?"

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４７）
    康濯
    大三立起来，挥着礼帽，压住嗓门说：“好，老白，你说得对！我就是没认识！”说着，他猛一把把礼帽戴上，胳膊挥着舞着，嗓音又高了起来，大撒手嚷道：“我不对！可我张远禄也知道，如今是咱自己的世道，老尹没跟我多捣拉过嘛，开会我也听说过不止一回！大伙看的起我，选我开窑，让我卖力气，我干！可你们不兴也好好想想？……”大三好象火气挺大，只闹得柳沟家一个劲指着他吆喝：“你坐下好好说不行？你看你这态度！你这可怎么说清事理了啊！哎呀，没见过你这人的……”小洋鬼却急得两条短腿在一边来回跳着，叹息道：“这可有什么说头啊！唉，这这这……又是一黑家耽误了的……唉，大三叔，你你不兴歇歇慢慢说么？唉……”拴成靠近大三，拉着他的胳膊说：“大三叔！你说得对，咱们不论对工作对你都有缺点。你有什么说的，你提吧！你给提出来帮助帮助咱们吧！”扁小林宝小洋鬼和柳沟家等人，一时也都围上大三，都说他们有缺点，叫大三提，并打劝他，让他好好安下心来合计开窑的事情；只有泰成一个人坐在火炉边，低着脑袋望着火，一个劲抽烟，啥也不说。这边大三忽然推开众人，一双脚“通通通”直走到里边铺柜上坐着，低头说道：“我可真有一大些个意见！”人们又都上这边叫他说，他却又推开众人，“通通通”走到老白跟前说：“我得先跟你捣拉捣拉再说。老白，我先回，今黑家你去我那睡吧！”他回过头来：“大伙！咱错也再错这一回！窑的事明个再说。”说完，他掉头走了。
    屋里的人一个个＠＠地说不上话。泰成立起来道：“不讨论了吧！咱可走哩！”他走了。喜禄看看众人，也嘻笑着说：“尹同志白同志拴成们！你们操劳操劳，好好打劝打劝大三吧！咱也回啦！”他也走了。留下的人这才围着火炉坐下，互相说开了大三；他们有的是说他们知道的大三的什么什么事，有的是检讨工作和自己，有的是说对大三的意见，后来又商议了一阵怎么帮助大三……他们捣拉到上三星快当顶，又约定了明个前晌再开干部会，就都散了。老白末了还跟老尹说了一阵话，才和天禄相跟着，去大三那里睡去。
　　四十二　教化
    第二天，老尹和干部们早早就上了庙，打算接着商议昨天没计划好的工作；但老白却怎么也不来，小洋鬼去叫了一趟，也还是他一个人回了，他说：“人家理也不理，光管跟大三嚷！也不知嚷些什么！”老尹不觉又私下里嘀咕起来，心想这工农干部们作工作立场倒是稳，可多数是文化低，没计划没制度，顺着自己的脾气干：这实在也是个毛病。老尹扑展着眼皮想了一阵，就叫拴成和林宝还在庙上安顿分果实的事，他拉上别的干部们上大三家找老白去了。
    却说昨天黑夜大三回了以后，就一直坐着等老白；老白来了，二人就喝开了酒。喝酒当中，老白问道：“你不是有话么？说吧！”大三却还是不啃声，只闷着头子一大口一大口地喝。老白这时火气也平了，也就没说什么，光靠坐在炕上望着大三一边喝一边发红的俩大眼，心中想着一些发动工人和教育工人的事情，酒喝完，天上三星偏西了，两人也都有点醉，就都睡了。到今个大早，大三却一起来便推醒老白，说道：“昨儿个咱俩还没好好捣拉完哩！起吧，起来听我说说。”老白躺在被子里打着哈欠说：“就这么说吧！”大三坐上炕沿，先说他过去不找八路军和解放以后工作不靠前，实是错误；接着就说：春起那个姓武的来领导翻身，那样的人可怎么算个共产党？华大老尹倒是好得多，可他连个开窑的事也领导不起来，他对窑不摸门吧，也不好好寻人讯问，反叫这地势千年万辈的窑黑们去担硔！再说老尹待他大三，也不知因为什，贫农组也不叫他参加，把他一个要什没什的工人撂得远远地，却让小洋鬼柳沟家那样稀里糊涂的人也给选上当干部！就是拴成吧，人虽说的确不赖，可自从办上了工作，也轻易不找他……最后，他说：“我的错误我都接受。可我上边说的这些话……”老白早就听得瞪了眼，这时忽翻身坐起，衣服也不穿，就打断大三的话道：“你还光抱怨别人哩！我说你这也算个老工人么？算是咱的个老伙计么？”大三望望老白，心眼一＠，知道这人又动了气，就忙走开去圪蹴在地下，心里想道：这人怎么变得比我这态度还不如哩！这边老白穿上衣裳，下炕走了一阵，又道：“我生气倒也不对！可也不由的我不……我说大三，咱们是工人哩！工人阶级哩！你记不的我过去跟你捣拉过的那些？”
