[Reported by this newspaper]

To resolve existing disputes between labor and management, and to achieve the goal of restoring and developing production for the mutual benefit of labor and management, the representatives of workers and the representatives of the industry association of the Beijing Textile and Dyeing Industry have, based on the current situation of the textile and dyeing industry, reached the following collective agreement through consultation:

Article 1: The employer shall not interfere with or restrict employees from participating in social activities, nor shall the employer dismiss employees on this basis. If an employee needs to take up working time due to meetings or official duties, they must obtain the employer's consent, except for activities of a city-wide common nature.

Article 2: Employees have the right to be hired and to resign voluntarily. If resigning voluntarily, the employee shall notify the labor union and the employer five days in advance.

Article 3: The employer has the right to hire and dismiss employees, but must comply with the following principles:

	1. During the employment period, if it is necessary to reduce business operations due to business reasons, or if it is necessary to dismiss employees due to closure or change of business approved by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the employer shall notify the employee and the labor union half a month in advance. If the employee and the labor union disagree, they have the right to protest.

	2. If an employee is dismissed for serious violations of factory rules, the employer shall notify the employee and the labor union five days in advance. If they disagree, they may present a defense.

	3. Dismissed employees shall be given severance pay by the employer based on their length of service and the circumstances of each factory, equivalent to one to three months of actual wages (including meal allowance). However, this shall not apply to those who voluntarily resign or are dismissed for violating factory rules.

	4. When the employer changes the mode of production or legally changes business, employees who are willing to continue working with the changed mode of production or business shall be retained as appropriate. Those who are unwilling shall be paid severance pay in accordance with item 3.

	5. When the employer's property rights are transferred, if the employees are retained by the new owner and continue to receive wages, the old owner shall not pay severance pay.

	6. When the employer resumes business or expands business and needs to hire employees, the employer shall give priority to the previously dismissed employees of the factory to be hired under the same conditions, except for those currently employed in the same industry or those dismissed for violating factory rules. The employer shall notify the employee 15 days in advance or publish a notice in the newspaper. Failure to report by the deadline shall be deemed a waiver.

Article 4: Wages and Payment Calculation

	1. Implement one or more methods of paying wages in kind, calculated based on Fudi millet as the standard, and paid twice a month. The method is to pay half of the monthly wage in millet and half in municipal cloth (Second Factory Red Five Blessings) at mid-month and at the end of the month, with every two jin of millet equivalent to one chi of municipal cloth. If employees wish to convert the cloth to cash, they may calculate it based on the retail price of Fudi millet and the quoted price of the Trade Corporation's Five Blessings cloth on the date of payment as published in the Renminbi newspaper. Employees may, if they have special needs, negotiate with the employer to borrow wages in advance.

	2. The wages of weaving workers are based on the following standards: 11 jin of white municipal cloth with 20 warp and 20 weft (86 warp threads, 70 weft threads), 3 jin of 110 chi long, 6 zhang strip cloth with 20 warp and 32 weft (68 warp threads, 58 weft threads), and 4.5 jin of 8 zhang strip cloth with 20 warp and 32 weft (76 warp threads, 64 weft threads), and a piece-rate progressive wage system is implemented. Other types of cloth are calculated in proportion to their length, weight, complexity, and simplicity.

		(1) Implement a piece-rate progressive wage system, but the principle is to increase the number of levels and reduce the number of pieces per level, to be negotiated by both parties within the following ranges. The number of pieces to be delivered: white municipal cloth, 34 pieces by electric power, 13 pieces by manual power; 8 zhang strip cloth, 50 pieces by electric power, 20 pieces by manual power; 6 zhang strip cloth, 75 pieces by electric power, 30 pieces by manual power. The progressive increase upwards shall not exceed 10 pieces per level for electric power and 5 pieces per level for manual power. Each level shall be based on no more than one-third to two-fifths of the wage per piece of the previous level. If the number of pieces per level cannot be completed, the wage shall be calculated according to the wage per piece of the same level.

		(2) Based on the general maximum monthly output per person for the above three types of cloth, calculated as 52 pieces of white municipal cloth for two electric looms and 19 pieces for one manual loom, 75 pieces of 8 zhang strip cloth for two electric looms and 30 pieces for one manual loom, 110 pieces of 6 zhang strip cloth for two electric looms and 52 pieces for one manual loom, the standard for calculating the piece-rate progressive wage is generally 210 jin of millet for manual looms and 234 jin of millet for electric looms, excluding food and lodging. The increase or decrease shall be negotiated by both parties based on the situation (the back prosperity of the cloth, the quality of the machine, etc.). However, the minimum wage earned shall not be less than 150 jin of millet for manual looms and 170 jin of millet for electric looms.

		(3) The wages for axis breakage and weft breakage are calculated according to the following situations:

		A. Workers are paid wages when performing other work.

		B. If the employer has no work to assign, no wages are paid for up to one-half of the daily working hours; beyond that, one-half of the wages are paid.

		C. If there are difficulties that cannot be overcome by human effort due to weather or raw materials, the wages shall be negotiated separately by both parties.

		(4) The wages for converting manual machines to power machines (the time limit shall be negotiated by both parties) and for doing ironwork for converting power machines shall be paid as usual if the workers repair the machines themselves; if not repaired by themselves, it is the same as axis breakage.

		(5) In the case of "soft axis," the amount of wage increase per piece shall be reviewed and considered by the labor union group and the employer based on the circumstances.

		(6) Men and women workers shall receive equal pay for equal work.

	3. The wages of workers who make spindles and tassels shall be calculated by piece and do not include food and lodging (if food and lodging are provided or wages are calculated by day, it shall be negotiated separately by both parties). The wage standards are as follows:

		I. Making Spindles
		Type of thread			Number of Pieces			Wage
									Electricity					Manual
		20 count				One bundle					1.5 to 2 jin				3 to 5 jin

		II. Making Tassels
					Electricity					Manual
		Unit of measurement		Wage
		20 count one bundle			1.5 to 3 jin of millet
					Unit of measurement		Wage
					Supplying one machine	2 to 2.5 jin of millet

		Each factory shall negotiate the wage based on the quality of the machine between labor and management, but the wage earned shall not be lower than the above minimum wage.

	4. The specific amount of wages for staff and other monthly workers shall be negotiated by labor and management, but the minimum wage for accountants, technicians, and dyeing workers shall not be less than 170 jin of millet. In addition, the minimum wage for cooks and other employees shall not be less than 150 jin of millet.

Article 5: The working hours shall be 10 hours in principle, and shall not exceed 12 hours at most, including meal time.

Article 6: Holidays and Leave

	1. New Year's Day, May Day, National Day and other commemorative festivals shall be implemented in accordance with the holidays prescribed by the government, and wages shall be paid as usual.

	2. The Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival and New Year's holidays shall be maintained as before, and wages shall be paid.

	3. Generally, two days off per month, and those who originally received wages shall continue to receive wages.

	4. The regulations for employees' weddings, funerals and their holidays shall be handled in accordance with the original habits of each factory. If there are no habits, both parties shall formulate them separately.

	5. Female workers shall be given 45 days of leave before and after childbirth, 15 days of leave for miscarriage within three months, and 30 days of leave for miscarriage after three months. They shall not be dismissed on the pretext of this, and wages shall be paid as usual.

Article 7: Meals

	1. At least four feasts per month (rice and white flour, and appropriate additional vegetable money according to the circumstances of each factory). If the production and business conditions are good, appropriate increases may be made as appropriate, and daily meals should also be adjusted at any time, and more opinions from employees should be sought.

	2. For those with meal groups, the employer shall provide millet, and the specific amount shall be negotiated by both parties. However, the minimum shall not be less than 70 jin of millet per person per month (coal, water, and electricity are excluded, and the wages of cooks are included).

Article 8: Employee Benefits

	1. Employees who are usually sick shall have their meals appropriately improved, and those who have special difficulties and cannot afford medical expenses shall be given appropriate subsidies by the employer as appropriate.

	2. All medical expenses for employees who are injured or disabled on the job (including internal and external injuries and disabilities) shall be borne by the employer. Those who are disabled but can work shall be retained for employment as appropriate, and given appropriate work voluntarily. Those who cannot work shall be given living expenses depending on the severity of the disability, with a minimum of not less than six months of actual wages (including meal allowance). All funeral expenses for employees who die on the job shall be borne by the factory, and a condolence payment shall be given as appropriate, with a minimum of not less than twelve months of actual wages (including meal allowance).

	3. The employer shall provide employees with haircuts two to three times a month and bathing once a month.

	4. The employer shall gradually install all welfare items for the factory (hygiene and safety equipment, etc.) to the extent possible. And on the day of monthly wage payment, a monthly cultural and educational fund equal to 1.5% of the total wages of all employees shall be handed over to the labor union.

	5. If the employer has provided employees with clothing or clothing subsidies in the past years, the old practice shall be maintained. For temporary provision of clothing and other expenses after liberation, both parties shall negotiate.

Article 9: The apprenticeship and trainee years shall be implemented according to the old practice, but they shall be democratically evaluated by the factory workers' group and the employer based on their skills and achievements, and transferred to formal workers or staff at any time. Generally, apprentices who learn to weave cloth shall be able to weave formally only if they are physically normal.

Article 10: In addition to providing food, apprentices and trainees shall be given allowances based on their skills and work ability, with a monthly minimum of not less than 30 jin of millet.

Article 11: The employer shall reward those who have made excellent production achievements, saved raw materials, or improved technology.

Article 12: Each factory may, when necessary, formulate its own collective agreement in accordance with the circumstances of each factory, but it shall not conflict with the spirit of this agreement.

Article 13: The effective period of this agreement is six months, from December 1, 1949 to May 31, 1950. At that time, representatives of labor and management shall separately review and modify or declare the extension of its effective period.

Article 14: This agreement shall be implemented after being signed by labor and management and approved by the Labor Bureau. Labor and management shall each hold a copy, and the right of interpretation belongs to the Labor Bureau.
