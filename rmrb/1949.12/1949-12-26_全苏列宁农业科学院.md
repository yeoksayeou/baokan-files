　　All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences
　　The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences was established in 1929. It is the highest scientific body for agriculture in the entire Soviet Union. Its predecessor was the All-Union Central Agricultural Institute, which was established in accordance with the resolution of the First All-Union Congress of Soviets in 1922.

　　The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences is the headquarters of the Soviet Union's advanced agricultural biological sciences. Agricultural biological science was founded by the brilliant Soviet scholars Michurin and Williams. Lysenko is the great developer of this science, and he is now the chairman of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

　　The Academy of Agricultural Sciences guides the work of numerous agricultural scientific research institutes and experimental stations, studies a wide variety of problems in the field of agricultural science, and makes great contributions to the development of socialist agriculture. In twenty years, it has cultivated many famous varieties of grains, fruit trees, vegetables, melons, industrial crops, subtropical plants and other crops. It has created varieties suitable for the conditions of various regions of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the formerly barren Soviet Arctic region can now be cultivated. Its contributions in improving soil fertility and plant protection are extremely significant. It has also created many new types of agricultural machinery, such as automatic mowing machines, sugar beet combine harvesters, artificial rainfall machines, etc.

　　The Academy of Agricultural Sciences maintains close contact with a large number of agricultural workers, collective farmers, and state farm workers. Therefore, the research of science is closely coordinated with the needs of the national economy and people's livelihood, and at the same time, the achievements of advanced science can be immediately promoted and implemented. Here are two examples:

　　Seed vernalization – that is, sowing winter crops (such as winter wheat) in the spring can still produce good harvests. The method is simply to soak the seeds and place them at a low temperature for several days, and then sow them in the soil. This method was implemented on 1,000 hectares even before the Soviet Patriotic War, and now it is being adopted on an even larger scale. This method greatly shortens the growing season of plants in the fields, adding a great deal of extra grain to the Soviet state.

　　Summer potato planting – generally potatoes are planted in the spring, but in the southern part of the European part of the Soviet Union, planting potatoes in the spring yields very poor harvests. Even if a little is harvested, using it as seed will result in no harvest in the second generation. Therefore, it is necessary to expend a great deal of effort to transport potatoes from the north to the south. In the past, many agronomists blindly believed that it was due to soil conditions and were helpless. Later, after studying it, Lysenko determined that it was due to the hot climate there, so he created the summer planting method. When potatoes are planted in the summer and form potatoes in the fall, the temperature has already dropped, so they can be harvested as usual. Now this method is widely used in southern Russia.

　　There are many, many such examples that cannot be fully recounted.

　　There are two major events in the history of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences:

　　The first was the session of the Academy of Sciences in August 1948. This meeting summarized the struggle between two directions in biology over the years, held high the banner of the victory of Michurin biology, and thoroughly shattered the bankrupt Morgan-Mendelian theory and practice. Lysenko delivered a report at the meeting: "On the Situation in Biology." This report has been translated into our country.

　　The other event was the session of the Academy of Sciences in May 1949. This meeting discussed how science can cooperate to complete the Soviet Union's three-year plan for animal husbandry. Many of the resolutions of the meeting unfolded a great prospect for Michurin biology in the field of animal husbandry.

　　Under the constant care of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet state, and Stalin, the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences is helping the people create a prosperous life and create the conditions for a communist society.

　　全苏列宁农业科学院
    全苏列宁农业科学院建立于一九二九年。它是苏联全国农业最高的科学机关。它的前身是苏联中央农业研究所，这个研究所是根据一九二二年全苏苏维埃第一次代表大会决议而成立的。
    全苏列宁农业科学院是苏维埃先进农业生物科学底司令部。农业生物科学是由苏联光辉的学者米丘林和威廉姆斯打下基础的。李森科是这一科学伟大的发展者，现在他是全苏列宁农业科学院底主席。
    农业科学院指导许许多多农业科学研究所和实验站底工作，研究农业科学领域中各种各样的问题，对于社会主义农业底发展，有极大的贡献。在二十年中，它培育了许多著名的谷类、果树、蔬菜、瓜类，工业作物，亚热带植物及其他农作物品种。它为苏联各个地区创造了适应该地区条件的品种，因此，原来是不毛之地的苏联极北地带，现在已经可以耕种了。在提高土坏肥力方面，植物保护方面，它的贡献极为宏大。它还创造了许许多多新式的农业机器，如自动刈草机、甜菜合收获机、人工降雨机等等。
    农业科学院经常与人数众多的农业工作者、集体农民、国营农场工作者保持密切的联系，因此科学所研究的紧紧地配合着国计民生的需要，同时先进科学底成就能立刻推广实行。这里可举两个例子：
    种籽春化法——就是把冬种的（如冬小麦）种籽在春天播种，照样可以有好收成。其办法简单说来便是把种籽浸湿放在低温度下若干天，然后再播到土里。这种方法还在苏联卫国战争以前，就有一千公顷施行，现在则是更大规模地被采用了。这个办法使植物在田地里生长期大大缩短，给苏维埃国家额外增加了极多的粮食。
    马铃薯（洋芋）夏栽法——一般马铃薯都是在春天栽种的，但在苏联欧洲部分底南部，春天栽种马铃薯收成很坏，即使是收了一点，用来作种，第二代就完全不收了。因此就不得不费极多的力量从北方向南方运马铃薯。以前许多农学家盲目地认为是土质关系，都束手无策。后来经李森科加以研究，乃断定是由于那里气候太热，因此便创造了夏栽法。马铃薯夏栽，秋天结马铃薯时气温已经降低，便能照常地有收获。现在这个方法在南俄已经普遍应用了。
    这样的例子很多很多，是数说不尽的。
    全苏列宁农业科学院底历史上，有两件大事：
    第一件就是一九四八年八月间该院院士会议。这次会议总结了多年来生物学中两个方向的斗争，高高举起米邱林生物学胜利的旗帜，彻底粉碎了理论、实践全盘破产了的孟根尔·莫尔根主义。李森科在该次会议上作了报告：“论生物学底现状”。这个报告我国已有译本。
    另一件事是一九四九年五月该院的院士会议。这次会议是讨论科学如何配合完成苏联牧畜业三年计划的。会议许多决议为米丘林生物学在牧畜领域中展开伟大的远景。
    在苏联共产党、苏维埃国家及斯大林经常的关怀之下，全苏列宁农业科学院，帮助人民创造富裕的生活，创造共产主义社会的条件。
