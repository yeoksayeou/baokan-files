　　You Have Fought Until Dawn
　　In Memory of Jiang Jie, Who Died in Chongqing
　　Tao Gong
　　Chongqing is liberated. In the celebratory frenzy, I think of you—Jiang Jie, and your group in prison. I remotely congratulate you, celebrating your fight until dawn to gain freedom. I seem to see you happily shaking hands with comrades, returning to your own ranks, embracing and kissing your Yun'er.

　　Today, as my comrades and I discuss how to implement the resolutions of the Asian Women's Conference, I remember what you said: "Do a good job in women's work, don't be bothered by trivialities. The degree of women's awakening is a measure of social progress." This is what you often told us. Today, I am preparing to tell you, sending you a letter for the first time from the people's capital, telling you that we will guarantee the successful implementation of the conference.

　　But at this moment, I saw the newspaper headline "More Than 500 Political Prisoners Killed in Chongqing," the prominent characters piercing my eyes and igniting my furious anger. The dying frenzy of the reactionaries, the cruel killing, is unmatched by any fascist torture in the world. Although today we are ending the Jiang gang's more than thirty years of brutal slaughter of the people, we must further denounce this crime to the world, and we must demand blood debt repayment!

　　Jiang Jie, it is you, the five hundred martyrs, the blood of thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs, that have cultivated the fruits of the people's victory today. How should we, the survivors, defend and strengthen these fruits of victory?

　　I still remember after the anti-tyranny parade, American jeeps used to circle our school. The situation was very tense, and the school was about to be searched. We urged you to leave, but you answered so firmly: "I won't leave. Even if I am arrested, at most I will die!" You were so determined to stick to your post. We were busy throwing Marxist-Leninist books into the fire. I cried as I watched the burning pile of books. You knew I had hidden them several times, and several friends had been sent to prison for reading these books. You wiped away my tears, stroked my head, and said, "You are such a child, don't cry. In the future, these books will be our textbooks, just like textbooks. For more important work, sacrificing these books is nothing!"

　　Today, I am here freely studying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought. Jiang Jie, what reason do I have to be lazy? It is you, it is thousands upon thousands of martyrs who have given me this opportunity to learn!

　　Once, I unconsciously pierced your heart. I naively asked you to tell me where my brother-in-law—Brother Liu—had gone. You only told me "gone to fight guerrillas!" and refused to say another word. Later, Sister Lin told me that Brother Liu was taken away by secret agents the day after Yun'er was born, and there had been no news of him ever since, but you were fighting so strongly!

　　After "June 2nd," friends went to the countryside to participate in armed struggle. One day, you also quietly told me that you were going to the countryside. I asked you, Yun'er is only seven months old, very weak, what about breastfeeding? You said, "I can't take care of so much, there are many children in China who need milk!" After a while, you said again: "You could say that today's war is for the future happiness of the children!" You smiled, so heartily! Like the sunny sky!

　　And so you went to the eastern Sichuan guerrilla area. In the cold winter, in the dark night, you and your comrades fought in the mountains and fields. You mobilized women to cooperate with the people's armed struggle. You became like a peasant woman, and your work was very good. Comrades were all honored by your work.

　　But last November, the news of your arrest came. It is said that under the enemy's cruel torture, you were still fighting so stubbornly: the executioners could not get anything, so they transferred you to the prison in Ciqikou. You paid the price of perseverance, waiting for liberation, looking again and again from the prison window with chains, looking far to the north, waiting for liberation; but the secret agents shot you three days before your expected liberation! Shot you and more than five hundred others! I will always remember you, the people will always remember you, I will not forget that today's victory; the people's regime is built by you, by the flesh and blood of thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs. We, this group of survivors, must defend and strengthen these fruits of victory, like you, like so many martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the interests of the revolution and the people. What right do I have to demand what suits my personal interests?

　　Jiang Jie, I cherish your memory, today I cherish your memory even more deeply, and fight even more strongly, learn even more solidly, and I want to exert all my strength to build our country!

### 你已战斗到天亮　悼念在重庆死难的江姐

　　你已战斗到天亮
    悼念在重庆死难的江姐
    陶公
    重庆解放了，在庆祝狂欢的热潮里，我想起了你——江姐，和你们在监牢里的一群，我遥远的庆贺你们，庆祝你们战斗到天亮获得了自由，我好象看见你愉快的和同志握手，回到自己的队伍来，抱着你的云儿亲吻。
    今天我和同志们谈起如何执行亚洲妇女大会的决议，我想起了你说的：“好好搞妇女工作，别嫌麻烦琐碎，妇女觉悟的程度是衡量社会进步的尺度。”这是你常向我们讲的话，今天我正准备告诉你，从人民的首都第一次寄信给你，告诉你，我们要保证大会胜利的执行。
    可是就在这时，我看见了报纸“重庆五百多政治犯被杀害”这突出的大字，刺痛了我的眼睛，也燃起了我愤恨的怒火，反动派临死的疯狂的残杀，是世界上任何法西斯的酷刑比不上的，虽然今天我们要结束蒋匪帮三十多年来对人民残酷的屠杀，我们更要向全世界控诉这罪行，我们要索还血债！
    江姐，是你，是五百烈士，是成千成万的先烈的血培植了今天人民胜利的果实，我们这没死者该如何来保卫并壮大这胜利果实呢？
    我还记得抗暴游行后，美国吉普车老在我们学校兜圈子，风声很紧了，学校将要被搜查，我们劝你离开，你却那么坚强的回答：“我不走，即使被捕顶多一死！”你是那么坚持工作岗位，我们忙着把马列主义的书籍投入火堆里，我望着燃烧的书堆哭了，你知道我已藏过好几次了，几个朋友为看这些书籍而送入了监牢，你替我拭干了眼泪，抚着我的头说：“你真是小孩，别哭了，以后这些书都是我们的课本，象教科书一样，为了更重要的工作，牺牲这些书算得什么！”
    今天我在这儿自由的学习着马列主义，毛泽东思想了，江姐我还有什么理由偷懒呢？这是你，是成千成万的烈士给了我这学习的机会！
    有一回，我竟不自觉的刺痛了你的心，我天真的要求你告诉我姐夫——刘大哥到哪里去了，你仅告诉我“打游击去了！”不肯多说一句话。后来林姐才告诉我，刘大哥在云儿出生的第二天，就被特务架走了，一直没有消息，而你是那么坚强的战斗着！
    “六、二”以后，朋友们纷纷下乡参加武装斗争。一天，你也悄悄的告诉我要下乡了，我问你云儿才七个月，身体很弱，吃奶怎么办？你却说：“顾不了这许多，全中国需要奶的孩子可多哩！”停一会你又说：“也可以说，今天的战争就是为孩子们未来的幸福吧！”你笑了，是那么爽朗！象睛天的太阳！
    就这样你去川东游击区了，在寒冷的冬天，在漆黑的夜里，你和同志们在山野里战斗着，你发动妇女配合人民的武装斗争，你变得和农妇一样，工作搞得很好。同志们都为你的工作感到光荣。
    可是去年十一月里，传来了你被捕的消息。听说在敌人残酷的拷打下，你仍是那样顽强地战斗着：刽子手们得不到一点什么，便把你移禁在磁器口的牢狱里。你是付出了坚忍在等待着解放，带着锁练从囚窗里望了又望，遥望得北方，期待着解放；可是特务就在你期待快到的三天前，枪杀了你！枪杀你们五百多人！我永远记得你们，人民永远记得你们，我忘不了今天胜利的果实；人民的政权是你们，是成千成万先烈的血肉筑成的。我们这一群后死者，要保卫并壮大这胜利果实，象你们，象许多先烈为革命为人民的利益献身，我有什么权利要求适合个人的兴趣呢？
    江姐，我追念你，今天我追念得更深，也战斗得更坚强，学习得更踏实，为了建设我们的国家，我要竭尽所有的力量！
