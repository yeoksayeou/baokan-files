　　Introduction to Political Economy Tutorial (43)
  　The Object, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economy Studies
  　Chapter Four: Characteristics of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Section One: The Scientific Nature, Unity, and Completeness of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Therefore, bourgeois economics, especially vulgar bourgeois economics, is not only unscientific, disunified, and incomplete, and unable to form a relatively unified and complete system, but on the contrary, it is characterized by anti-scientific, complex, intricate, chaotic, fragmented, and unsystematic features. This situation is even more serious in countries where capitalism is developed later. For example, American bourgeois political economy is a collection of viewpoints from various schools of economics, but it does not conduct comprehensive research and criticism of them, but rather compromises them, resulting in the emergence of the eclectic school or the American school in modern America. And some students who studied in the United States and returned to Japan and China are even more "outdoing their teachers," plagiarizing and copying various bourgeois economic theories, swallowing them whole, imitating them exactly, and peddling them everywhere. For example, Dr. Tokuzo Fukuda of Japan is such an expert in plagiarism and copying, and also a staunch anti-Marxist. Some bourgeois economists in China, when solving a problem, once listed various economic theories of various schools and families of bourgeois economists, and believed that they were all correct, not only failing to criticize them, but also failing to point out and distinguish the contradictions that existed between these various schools and families. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, a running dog of imperialism in old China, due to its political and economic reliance on American imperialism, its culture and academia also followed the lead of American imperialism, taking the United States as its teacher and increasingly becoming colonialized. Therefore, the neoclassical school, the Anglo-American school, the eclectic school, the mathematical school, and other schools of thought have noisily occupied the economics lecture halls of various universities for more than 20 years. It is time to criticize them today.
    The Common Characteristics of Anti-Science, Anti-Communism, and Anti-People of Bourgeois Political Economy in Capitalist Countries
    Although bourgeois economics in capitalist countries, especially vulgar bourgeois economics, is unscientific, disunified, and incomplete, they have a common characteristic, namely, the common characteristic of anti-science, anti-communism, and anti-people. Because they proceed from the narrow self-interest of the bourgeoisie, they dare not face reality, they conceal and distort the truth of facts, so they cannot clearly, comprehensively, and deeply penetrate the internal relations of the social economy, and explore and expose its internal connections and inherent essence. This determines that it is unscientific, even anti-scientific. Similarly, also because they completely proceed from the narrow class interests of the bourgeoisie, or merely from the narrow prejudices of the bourgeoisie, they are in a hostile position with the proletariat and the working people for their own class interests, or merely for the personal self-interest of the capitalists. They oppose the proletariat, oppose the people, and thus also oppose the only scientific truth that liberates the proletariat and liberates mankind—Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, they are all anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-Marxist-Leninist, and they use this as capital to flaunt and call for each other. So they generally have reactionary characteristics.
    Section Two: The Historical Development and Predictability of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    The second characteristic of Marxist-Leninist political economy is its historicity, development, and predictability. First, let's talk about historicity.
    Political Economy is a Historical Science
    Its historicity is first manifested in the fact that Marxist-Leninist political economy "is, by its very nature, a historical science." Engels explained the meaning of this historical science in "Anti-Dühring," saying: It "has to investigate historical, that is, constantly changing material; it has first to investigate the special laws of each stage of development in production and exchange, and only after this investigation has been completed can it establish for itself the few, completely general laws applicable to production and exchange in general." And the main thing is to study the various special laws in the economy of each era or an era, and to study the main economic special laws that occupy a leading and dominant position in the economy of each era. The author has already discussed these in Section One of Chapter Three of the Introduction, "The Tasks and Significance of Political Economy," and will not repeat them here.
    Marxist Political Economy is a Product of a Certain History
    Secondly, the historicity of Marxist political economy is manifested in the fact that Marxist political economy is the product of a certain history, the product of the development of capitalist society and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to a certain period. That is, when capitalism develops, class struggle intensifies, the degree of proletarian consciousness increases, the proletariat is increasingly organized in the struggle, and its organizational strength is increasingly developed, due to the needs of class struggle, its representatives summarize the excellent elements of past human thought, transform and develop them, and create, produce, and strengthen it. Therefore, after it is produced, it becomes a weapon for the proletariat to carry out class struggle against the bourgeoisie, to resist the exploitation of the bourgeoisie, to overthrow the capitalist system, to carry out the proletarian socialist revolution, to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to determine the theoretical basis and revolutionary weapon of strategic policies and guidelines.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（４３）
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
  　第四章　马列主义政治经济学的特点
    第一节　马列主义政治经济学的科学性、统一性与完整性
    因此资产阶级经济学，尤其是庸俗派的资产阶级经济学，不但是不科学，不统一的，不完整的，不能形成一个比较统一的，比较完整的体系，而且却却相反，是以反科学性、复杂性、错综性、混乱性、破裂性与无系统性为其特点。这种情况越是在资本主义发达较迟的国家里，越见其严重。例如美国的资产阶级政治经济学本是集合了经济学各派学说的观点，但它并不是对它们加以综合研究与批判，而是加以折衷，于是就有挽近美国的折衷派或美国学派的出现。而日本与中国一些从美国留学回来的留学生们，更是“青出于蓝”，他们剽窃抄袭各派资产阶级经济学说，生吞活剥，依样卖葫芦，到处贩卖。例如日本的福田德三大博士便是这种抄袭剽窃专家，又是反马克思主义的健将。中国有的资产阶级经济学者，在解决一个问题时，曾经罗列了资产阶级经济学家各派各家的各种经济学说，并认为他们都是对的，不但不家加以批判，而且连这些各派各家间所存在着的矛盾也都不知加以指摘分辨。过去旧中国在帝国主义走狗国民党统治下，由于政治经济上依靠美国帝国主义，因此文化学术上也唯美帝国主义的马首是瞻，以美国为师宗，而日益殖民地化着。因此，新古典学派，英美学派，折衷学派，数理学派等等诸种学说，熙熙攘攘，二十余年来，占据了各大学的经济学讲坛，今天是应该加以批判的时候了。
    资产阶级政治经济学反科学反共反人民的共同特性
    资本主义各国资产阶级经济学，尤其是庸俗派的资产阶级经济学，虽然是不科学的，不统一的与不完整的，但是他们却具有一个共同的特性，即反科学、反共、反人民的共同特性。因为它们从狭隘的资产阶级的私利出发，他们不敢正视现实，他们隐蔽与歪曲事实的真相，所以它不能明确的、全面的、深刻的深入社会经济的内部关系，探究揭发其内部关联内在本质。从而决定了它是不科学的，甚至于反科学的。同样的，也由于他们完全是从资产阶级狭隘的阶级利益出发，或者仅仅从资产阶级的狭隘的偏见出发，他们为了自己的阶级利益，或者仅仅为了资本家个人的私利，他们与无产阶级、劳动人民大众，处于敌对的地位，他们反对无产阶级，反对人民大众，从而也反对解放无产阶级解放人类的唯一科学的真理——马列主义。因此他们也都是反共、反人民、反马列主义的，并且以此为资本，相标榜，相号召。所以它们一般地都具有反动的特征的。
    第二节　马列主义政治经济学的历史性发展性与预见性历史性
    马列主义政治经济学的特点之二，便是它的历史性、发展性与预见性。首先谈历史性。
    政治经济学是一种历史的科学
    其历史性首先表现于马列主义政治经济学“就其本身的本质上说来，是一种历史的科学”。这种历史的科学的意义，恩格斯在“反杜林论”中曾有所解释，他说：它是“要研究历史的，也就是不断变化着的材料，它首先要研究生产与交换各个发展阶段的特殊规律，然后才能作为这种研究的结论，定出可以适用于一般的生产与交换的少数，完全普遍的诸规律”。而主要的还是在于研究各时代或一时代经济中各种特殊的规律，研究各时代经济中占领导支配地位的那种主要的经济的特殊规律。关于这些，作者在绪论第三章第一节政治经济学的任务与意义中，已经有所论列，这里不再重复了。
    马克思主义政治经济学是一定的历史的产物
    其次，马克思主义政治经济学的历史性表现于马克思主义政治经济学是一定的历史的产物，是资本主义社会，无产阶级与资产阶级斗争发展到一定时期的产物。也就是当资本主义发展，阶级斗争尖锐化，无产阶级觉悟程度提高，无产阶级在斗争中日益组织起来，其组织力量日益发展，由于阶级斗争的需要，由其代表人物总结过去人类思想的优良成分而加以改造发展而创造产生出来，壮大起来的。因此，它产生出来以后，就成为无产阶级与资产阶级进行阶级斗争的武器，成为反抗资产阶级剥削推翻资本主义制度，进行无产阶级社会主义革命，实现无产阶级专政，确定战略政策方针的理论根据和革命武器。
