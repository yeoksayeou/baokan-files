　　Leading the Branch to Summarize Work and Mobilize Farmers to Evaluate Cadres
    Songjiang Provincial Party Committee and Government Work Group Creates Experience to Consolidate and Promote Winter Sideline Production Achievements
    When at a loss how to summarize work, start by discussing what the masses have approved of and opposed to over the past year.
    Further expand the discussion: Why do the masses still not approve of things that are beneficial to them? The conclusion is that the leadership has not been good.
    The summary is: continue to do things that are beneficial to the masses; for things that are beneficial but opposed, conduct good publicity and take the lead in doing them; do not do things that are not beneficial to the masses.
    The branch formulates a production plan for next year and submits it to the village people's representative meeting for discussion. At the same time, mobilize the masses to offer opinions and evaluate cadres.
    [Our Newspaper's News] In the process of launching a large-scale rural sideline production campaign this winter, the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee and the Songjiang Provincial People's Government sent work groups to various places to carry out work. After achieving certain results, in order to consolidate and promote the existing achievements, the work groups led three key villages in summarizing work and evaluating cadres, and gained experience. According to the experience of key village work, carrying out summary work and cadre evaluation movements in rural areas has a great effect on improving the village people's representative meetings, promoting rural democracy, strengthening the leadership of branch members, improving the work ability and enthusiasm of cadres, improving leadership methods, and close the relationship between the masses and cadres, it is helpful to persist and consolidate the winter production campaign, and lay the foundation for further carrying out large-scale production campaigns in the future. The key tasks of summarizing work and evaluating cadres were carried out in Laoying, Limin, and Daling villages. Laoying Village's approach was to start with summarizing work, the content of which was mainly to check production leadership. The cadres sent down by the provincial party committee first convened party members in the village branch to discuss what achievements had been made in leading production in the past year. Because a year was too long, and party members and cadres were not used to summarizing work, they did not know where to start. So they turned to talking about the difficulties in the past year's work. Many party members and cadres took this opportunity to complain about the hardships of the year. Everyone felt that the work in the village was difficult, and they were being blamed by both their superiors and the public; it wasted too much time, etc. Then they studied what the masses approved of and disapproved of in the past year. Everyone agreed: First, the masses approved of leading production and completing the task of handing over public grain; second, controlling idlers and preventing gambling; third, they did not approve of organizing cooperatives at the beginning, but later they approved of them... On the other hand, first, they did not approve of being organized, and were unwilling to hand over good public grain; second, they did not approve of holding large meetings; third, they did not approve of forced manure collection; fourth, they did not approve of banning cutting down trees in the mountains; fifth, they did not approve of banning reclamation on "steep slopes" (referring to mountain slopes with a slope of 30 degrees or more). Based on these issues, the work group enlightened party members to conduct item-by-item discussions. When discussing why the masses did not approve of things that were beneficial to them, they guided party members to examine their role in these work or production, and then study the branch's leadership over production in the past year. For example, when discussing the organization of labor exchange, many party members reflected that their role in the past year's production was not enough. Most party members and cadres thought that doing general administrative work was the specific work of the party. They did not lead the masses to produce well. Only three of the eleven party members in the village participated in mutual aid groups, and their understanding of labor exchange organizations was still vague; at the same time, they forced the masses to organize in a mandatory way, and the masses did not benefit from the labor exchange, so they did not approve of it; everyone finally realized that it was not that the labor exchange organization was not good, but that it was not well led. For example, when studying why the masses did not approve of holding meetings, everyone finally realized that it was because there were too many large meetings, and they could not solve the problem. Every time they spoke at the meeting, they went around and around like "grinding a mill" without end, delaying everyone's production, so the masses opposed it. After studying item by item in this way, everyone unanimously realized that many tasks (such as manure collection, banning steep slope reclamation, etc.) were not well led, and the publicity was not thorough. And if the leadership is good, there will be achievements, such as this year's publicity for collecting public grain was thorough, and the masses were willing to hand over good public grain. Finally, the annual work was summarized: things that are good and that the people approve of should continue to be done next year; for things that the people do not approve of, it should be seen whether they are beneficial to the people or not. If they are beneficial, party members and cadres should continue to publicize them and take the lead in setting an example, and find ways for the masses to implement them; party members and cadres should oppose things that are not beneficial to the masses. If there are shortcomings or mistakes in the leadership, they should be corrected. Finally, the branch committee made a report to all party members based on the discussion and summary; and put forward a production plan for next year, and suggested that the village people's representative meeting discuss it. After the discussion and approval, party members set an example in implementing it. Party members thought that this summary method was very good, specific and practical. Everyone's thinking has also taken a step forward, and they have found the key points in their work. Then, a party-wide merit evaluation campaign was carried out, and non-party masses were absorbed to participate, and three model party members were selected at the branch meeting. Then, a meeting of administrative cadres was convened, with party members and cadres as the core, to conduct a summary of village administration and cadre evaluation. And a mass meeting was held to explain the significance of summarizing work and evaluating cadres; then the village representatives led the citizen groups to hold meetings to widely solicit opinions from the masses on cadres. Finally, a village representative meeting was held, and each representative brought the opinions of the masses to the meeting to evaluate cadres.
    From the experience of Laoying and Daling villages, the masses generally talked about both good and bad cadres when evaluating cadres, and they did not talk much about the middle ones; in addition, they talked more about the advantages, and then carefully pointed out the shortcomings of the cadres. The advantages and disadvantages of each cadre were mentioned more comprehensively. One point that deserves special attention is that cadres who can solve production difficulties for the masses and lead the masses to actively produce are particularly supported by the masses. This point is of great educational significance to party members and cadres, and it corrects the tendency of some party members and cadres to neglect leading production work.
    After summarizing work and evaluating awards, party members and cadres "have a bottom line for their work and know what to do," and their confidence in their work has been improved; at the same time, they have corrected the previous idea of some cadres that "the masses have no conscience and the work in the village is not easy to do," and their work attitude is also more active than before. Yang Hua, a cadre of Laoying Village, heard that he was rated as a model cadre while he was ill, and got up at night and ran to tell the work group: "I have some advantages, but I still have many shortcomings." He got up early the next morning and went to the village cooperative to order goods while he was still sick.
    Generally, cadres can humbly examine their shortcomings, accept the opinions of the masses, promote rural democracy, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. At the same time, it greatly enhanced the prestige of the village people's representative meeting. In the past, the representatives often compared themselves to "errand boys," and this time they were able to evaluate the merits of the cadres and make suggestions, and felt that they "really have power." This provides favorable conditions for further improving the village people's representative meeting and conducting the next village election.
    In addition, individual cadres who have a particularly bad style and are universally dissatisfied by the masses have been appropriately criticized by the masses in the evaluation, such as Zhou Feng, a cadre of the Zhoujiayao Farmers Association, who has a very bad style, stirs up troubles, and speculates and profiteers with the landlords of the village. He was not elected in the village election after the evaluation. However, the leadership must pay attention to preventing bad people from taking the opportunity to attack cadres.

　　领导支部总结工作发动农民评奖干部
    松江省委省府工作组创造经验巩固与发扬冬季副业生产成绩
    总结工作无从下手，就从一年来群众赞成什么、反对什么谈起。
    进一步展开讨论：为什么对群众有利的事，群众还不赞成？结论是没有领导好。
    总结起来：对群众有利的事情，继续办；有利而遭反对的事情，好好进行宣传，带头干；不利于群众的事情就不要做。
    支部订出明年生产计划，提交村人民代表会讨论。同时发动群众提意见，评奖干部。
    【本报讯】在开展今冬大规模的农村副业生产运动中，中共松江省委及松江省人民政府曾派出工作组，赴各地开展工作。在获得一定成绩之后，工作组为使已有成绩得到巩固与发扬，工作组曾领导三个重点村进行了总结工作与评奖干部运动，并获得经验。据重点村工作的经验，农村间进行总结工作与评奖干部运动，对健全村人民代表会、发扬农村民主、加强支部党员的领导、提高干部工作能力与积极性、改善领导方法、密切群众与干部关系等方面均有很大作用，有助于冬季生产运动的坚持与巩固，并为今后进一步开展大生产运动打下基础。总结工作与评奖干部重点工作分在老营、利民、大岭三村进行。老营村的作法是首先从总结工作着手，内容主要是检查生产领导。由省委派下来的干部，先在村支部内召集党员讨论一年来领导生产有那些成绩。因为一年时间太长，党员干部又不习惯于总结工作，无从下手。于是转而谈一年工作中的困难，有很多党员干部借此机会诉述一年的苦处，大家都认为村里工作难作，上下受气；耽误时间太多等等。随之又研究一年来群众赞成我们些什么？不赞成些什么？大家一致认为：一、群众赞成领导生产，完成交公粮任务；二、管制二流子，不让赌博；三、办合作社开始不赞成，后来赞成了……。另一方面，一、不赞成组织起来，不愿交好公粮；二、不赞成开大会；三、不赞成强迫拾粪；四、不赞成禁止进山砍树；五、不赞成禁止在“山坡陡”（指三十度以上山坡地）开荒。工作组根据这些问题启发党员进行逐条的讨论。讨论到对群众有利的事情群众为什么不赞成时，就引导党员检讨自己在这些工作或生产中的作用，进而研究支部在一年中对生产的领导。如讨论到组织换工时，很多党员反省了在一年生产中自己起的作用不够，大部党员干部认为作一般的行政工作就是党的具体工作，没有很好的领导群众生产，全村十一个党员只有三个参加互助组，还对换工组织认识模糊；同时，以强迫命令方式要群众组织起来，群众没有得到换工的好处，因此不赞成；大家最后认识到不是换工组织不好，而是没有领导好。又如研究群众为什么不赞成开会，大家最后认识到是因为开大会过多，而且不能解决问题，每次大会说话象“推磨”一样转来转去没个完，耽误大家的生产，因此群众反对。这样逐项研究之后，大家一致认识有很多工作（如拾粪、禁陡坡开荒等）没有领导好，宣传的不透澈。而领导得好的，就有成绩，如今年征公粮宣传得透澈，群众就愿意交好公粮。最后将全年工作总结起来：是好的，老百姓赞成的，明年应继续办；老百姓不赞成的，应看对老百姓有利无利，有利的，党员干部继续宣传，自己带头作样子，为群众想办法去实行；对群众不利的事，党员干部应该反对。如果是领导有缺点、有错误的，则应加以改正。最后由支委根据讨论总结，对全体党员作报告；并提出明年生产计划，建议村人民代表会议讨论。讨论通过后党员作模范执行。这样的总结方法，党员认为很好，又具体、又实际。大家的思想也提高了一步，找到了工作中的要点。随之进行党内评功运动，并吸收非党群众参加，在支部大会上评出三个模范党员。然后，召开行政干部会，以党员干部为核心，进行村行政的总结工作与干部评功。并召开群众大会，说明总结工作与评奖干部的意义；再由村代表领导各公民小组开会，广泛征求群众对干部的意见。最后召开村代表大会，由各代表把群众意见带到大会上给干部评奖。
    从老营、大岭两村的经验来看，群众评干部一般从好坏两种干部谈起，对中间的谈得不多；另外多从优点谈起，再有分寸的提出干部的缺点，对每个干部优缺点都提得比较全面。特别值得注意的一点是，凡能给群众解决生产困难，领导群众积极生产的干部，特别受到群众的拥护。这一点对党员与干部教育意义很大，纠正了一部分党员、干部忽视领导生产工作的偏向。
    经过总结工作与评奖以后，党员、干部对工作“有了底，知道了该怎么办”，工作信心提高了；同时，纠正了以前一部分干部认为“群众没有良心，村里工作不好干”的想法，工作态度也比以前积极了。老营村干部杨华，在病中听到被评为模范干部，夜里爬起来跑去告诉工作组：“我有些优点，反正缺点还不少。”第二天早起带病给村合作社办货去了。
    一般干部都能虚心检讨缺点，接受群众意见，发扬了农村的民主，改进了干部与群众的关系。同时大大提高了村人民代表会的威信。过去代表常自比为“跑腿学舌”的，这次能给干部评功和提意见，感到“真是有权”了。这给进一步健全村人民代表会、进行下届村选提供了有利条件。
    此外，对个别作风特别坏，为群众普遍不满的干部，在评奖中受了群众适当的批评，如周家窑农会干部周凤，作风很坏，挑拨是非，和本村地主共同投机倒把，在评奖后村选中落选了。但领导上必须注意，防止坏人乘机打击干部。
