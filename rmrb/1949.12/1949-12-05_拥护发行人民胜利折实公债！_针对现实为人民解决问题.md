    Support the Issuance of People's Victory Indexed Bonds!
　　Solve Problems for the People by Addressing Reality
    Zhang Lan
    The Central People's Government's adoption of the 1950 fiscal budget is a major event. The simultaneous issuance of Victory Indexed Bonds fully demonstrates the government's spirit of seeking truth from facts. It does not shy away from inflation, nor does it conceal difficulties. Precisely because it does not conceal or shy away, it shows that the government is solving problems for the people by addressing reality. Chairman Mao's statement that "there are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope" not only points out the difficulties but also stipulates ways to overcome them, naturally leading to absolute hope. The government is so frank with the people, and I believe the people will undoubtedly trust the government and be willing to do everything in their power to support it. This is the exact opposite of the relationship between the reactionary government and the people in the past, and the people and the reactionary government. This event fully embodies the spirit of the People's Government.

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！ 
　　针对现实为人民解决问题
    张澜
    这次中央人民政府通过一九五○年的财政概算，是一件大事，同时通过发行胜利折实公债，这充分表示了政府实事求是的精神，对于通货膨胀并不讳言，对于困难亦不掩饰，正惟其不隐讳，不掩饰，更见得政府是针对现实为人民解决问题的，毛主席所说“有困难，有办法，有希望”既说出了困难，又规定了克服困难的办法，自然就有了绝对的希望，政府对人民如此坦诚，我相信人民对正府也必是信之不疑而愿竭全力以支政府的，这与以前反动政府对人民，及人民对反动政府的情形，恰恰相反，这件事是充分表现了人民政府的精神。
