　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 16th - According to TASS, the Bulgarian Supreme Court continued the treason trial on the 10th, 11th, and 12th. On the morning of the 10th, Khadji-Panzov (former Counselor of the Yugoslav Embassy in Bulgaria) was interrogated again. After the court recorded his confession that he was ordered by Bijadze of the Tito group to carry out subversive activities in Bulgaria, it began to question relevant witnesses in the case.
　　Witness Gonchovski, who served in the Council of Ministers in 1947, confirmed Kostov's close relationship with the Yugoslav ambassador Zchimir. Witness Mladenov, the former chief judge of the Sofia Military Tribunal during the former royal fascist regime in Bulgaria, presided over the so-called "Trial No. 62" against members of the underground Central Committee of the Communist Party (including Kostov) in 1942. He testified that during that trial, the then Minister of the Army, Misov, instructed him to reduce Kostov's sentence, saying that this was the intention of King Boris. Witness Nachev confirmed that Deshev, the director of the political department of the police department, had hired Kostov, Kunin, Bogdanov, Maslarov and others. Katrandzhiev, who was a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1943, proved that in the autumn of 1942, Kostov wrote a letter from Pleven Prison to the Central Committee of the Party, opposing the armed struggle and guerrilla warfare against the German invaders, because he feared the terror of the occupiers. Kostov wrote: "Our allies in the Fatherland Front will be frightened by this terror, and our party will remain isolated." Former Gagola Police Chief Dimitrov proved that defendant Kristov (former Bulgarian trade representative to the Soviet Union) and Nachev had been hired as spies. Karushev, the former manager of the state-owned shipping enterprise, and others proved the sabotage work of defendants Tuzhev, Jevrelov, Stefanov, and Zhongchev in the economic field. Plamatarov, who used to work in the police station, proved that he was ordered by Pavlov to go to Pleven Prison to convey special instructions to Bogdanov.
　　On the 11th and 12th, witnesses were questioned. Witnesses Stoichev (Secretary of the Gorno-Jumaya District Committee from 1944 to 1945), Chalakchiev, Kakhirkov, Safirov, Uzunov, Nachev, Karaev, etc., cited various facts to confirm that defendants Ivanovski, Boyarchaliev, etc., under the instructions of the Yugoslav intelligence agency, used their positions to carry out subversive activities among the Macedonians in Bulgaria, attempting to incorporate the Bulgarian Pirin region into Yugoslavia by force, and then incorporate the entire Bulgaria into Yugoslavia. Karaev claimed that the US and British imperialists were not only acting through Tito, they also encouraged the Greek royal fascists to expel the Macedonians and secretly import their agents into Bulgaria. These agents used the concept of "independent Macedonia" to speculate, and encouraged the Titoists to seize the Pirin region and Bulgaria. Witness Timiv (former Director of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau), etc. also confirmed that defendants Kostov and others sabotaged production, undermined Bulgaria's economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and made it dependent on the US and British imperialism.
　　On the 12th, the court also questioned defense witnesses, and then heard reports from six expert committees. The reports listed the sabotage activities of the defendants in the country's industrial, financial, and other sectors, causing the country to suffer losses of tens of billions of leva (Bulgarian currency). In addition, the Seventh Committee investigated what information was provided to the British intelligence service by defendant Zhongchev when he was the manager of the People's Bank. The chief judge agreed that the committee would not make the materials public, because the materials confirming Zhongchev's espionage activities were related to state secrets.

　　保最高法院审讯叛国案证人
  　证实科斯托夫等叛国罪行
    【新华社北京十六日电】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚最高法院于十、十一、十二日续审叛国案。十日上午再度审讯哈德伊——潘佐夫（前南斯拉夫驻保大使馆参事），法庭在记录了他受铁托集团的比雅杰之命在保国进行颠覆活动的口供后，即开始讯问本案有关证人。
    一九四七年即在部长会议任职的证人冈朝夫斯基，证实科斯托夫和南斯拉夫大使兹齐米尔的密切交往。在保加利亚前保皇法西斯政权时代任索非亚军事法庭首席推事的证人姆拉杰诺夫，曾主持一九四二年对共产党地下中委会委员（科斯托夫在内）的所谓“第六十二号审判”，他证实在那次审判进行中，当时的陆军部长米索夫授命他给科斯托夫减刑，并说这是保王鲍里斯的意思。证人纳契夫证实警察署的政治部主任杰什夫曾召雇了科斯托夫、库宁、波格达诺夫、马斯拉罗夫等人。一九四三年曾任保共中委卡特兰吉耶夫证明一九四二年秋，科斯托夫从普列文监狱中写给党的中委会的信，信中反对反抗德寇的武装斗争和游击战，原因是害怕占领者的恐怖。科斯托夫写道：“我们祖国阵线中的同盟者将被这种恐怖吓住，我党将依然陷于孤立。”前加戈拉警察局长狄米特洛夫证明被告克里斯托夫（前保驻苏贸易代表）和纳切夫曾被雇用为间谍。前国营航运企业经理卡鲁谢夫等人证明吐捷夫，杰夫列诺夫，斯捷法诺夫，钟切夫等被告在经济方面的破坏工作。曾在警察局工作的普拉马塔罗夫证明他受巴夫洛夫之命到普列文监狱给波格达诺夫传达过特别训令。
    十一、十二两日继续讯问证人。证人斯托伊奇耶夫（一九四四至四五年任哥尔诺——尤马伊区党委书记）、查拉克奇耶夫、卡克希尔考夫、萨菲罗夫、乌祖诺、纳且夫、卡拉耶夫等人，列举各种事实，证实被告伊凡诺夫斯基、波雅尔查利雅夫等在南斯拉夫谍报机关指使下，利用其职位，在保境马斯顿人中进行颠覆活动，企图用武力把保属彼林区并入南斯拉夫，并继之把整个保加利亚并入南斯拉夫。卡拉耶夫称：美英帝国主义者不光是经过铁托进行活动，他们还鼓励希腊保皇法西斯分子驱除马其顿人，并把他们的代理人秘密输入保加利亚。而这些代理人则用“独立的马其顿”这一观念进行投机，并鼓励铁托分子夺取彼林区和保加利亚。证人梯米夫（前烟草专卖处处长）等亦证实被告科斯托夫等破坏生产、破坏保国与苏联及人民民主国家的经济关系，使之依附于美英帝国主义的活动。
    法庭十二日并讯问了辩护证人，随后又听取六个专家委员会的报告。报告列举各被告在国家的工业、财政、金融等部门中进行破坏活动，使国家遭受了数百亿利瓦（保币）的损失。此外，第七委员会曾调查过当被告钟切夫任人民银行经理时供给过英国情报处一些什么情报。首席推事同意委员会不把材料公开出来，因为证实钟切夫的间谍活动的材料关系国家秘密。
