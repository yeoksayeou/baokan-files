    --Editor

    The Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the entire Soviet Union approved the Soviet Constitution on December 5, 1936. The Soviet people, after its creator, call this new constitution the Stalin Constitution.

    Every clause and every word of the fundamental law of the socialist country shines with Stalin's wisdom, conciseness, and clarity. This historical document succinctly and concisely states the fact of the Soviet Union's socialist victory, the fact of the liberation of Soviet laborers from capitalist enslavement, and the fact of the victory of true socialist democracy in the Soviet state—democracy for the laborers.

    The Stalin Constitution legally enshrined many major innovations. As a result of these innovations, the Soviet state has become a socialist power with first-class industry, the world's largest agriculture, and the most advanced culture.

    The Stalin Constitution spiritually armed the Soviet laborers to carry out heroic and selfless labor for the benefit of the motherland and to strive for new victories in communism. Under the banner of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet society's political and moral unity, the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and vibrant patriotism have been further consolidated.

    Under the banner of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet people gloriously endured the test of the Great Patriotic War and won the historically significant victory over Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan.

    In the post-war period, the Soviet people, led by the great Lenin and Stalin Party, have achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural construction. The major task of the post-war Five-Year Plan—to restore and greatly surpass the pre-war levels of industry and agriculture—has been basically completed.

    During the years of the Second World War, the fascist aggressors brought enormous damage to the national economy of the Soviet state. Any other major country that suffered such damage would have fallen behind by ten years and been reduced to a second-rate power. However, the Soviet state gloriously defended its freedom and independence, and after the war, it became even stronger and more consolidated.

    The great victories of the Soviet people in labor and combat are clear proof of the invincible vitality of the Soviet social and state system.

    The Stalin Constitution, unlike the constitution of any capitalist country, has six basic characteristics.

    The first characteristic is that the Soviet Constitution is not a program outlining future prospects; it is a legislative affirmation of what already exists, what the Soviet people have achieved and won.

    Bourgeois constitutions usually promise happiness to the people, which in fact does not exist in capitalist society.

    The second characteristic is that the Soviet Constitution starts from the fact that the capitalist system in the Soviet Union has been eliminated and socialism has been victorious. The Stalin Constitution relies on the principles of socialism to legally consolidate the new and truly democratic system that has been established within the Soviet state.

    The Soviet Constitution reflects the basic principles of socialism that have been embodied in life: socialist ownership of land, forests, factories, and other means of production; the elimination of exploitation and the exploiting classes; the elimination of poverty for the majority and luxury for the few in the old society; the elimination of unemployment; labor becoming the glorious duty and responsibility of every able-bodied citizen; and the guarantee of the right to work, rest, education, and old-age or sickness relief for all citizens.

    The third characteristic of the Soviet Constitution is that it starts from the fact of the moral and political unity of Soviet society. In Soviet society, there are no antagonistic classes; it is composed of mutually friendly workers and peasant classes. The state leadership of Soviet society belongs to the working class, the most progressive class.

    The fourth characteristic of the Soviet Constitution is its deep internationalism. The fundamental law of the Soviet Union is that all nationalities and races enjoy equal rights in the Soviet state in social and economic life, social life, state life, and cultural life. True equality of nationalities and races is the law of socialism. Any propaganda of racial or national superiority, any propaganda of hatred and contempt, is punishable by law. In contrast, bourgeois constitutions consolidate inequality and national oppression for hundreds of millions of people.

    The fifth characteristic of the Soviet Constitution is its consistent and thorough democracy. The Stalin Constitution guarantees that all organs of power, from top to bottom, are elected according to the most democratic electoral system. All citizens who have reached the age of eighteen enjoy the right to vote in all organs of power.

    The Stalin Constitution allows voters to have the right to constantly supervise their elected representatives, and when the representatives are not trusted by the people, the voters have the right to recall them.

    Bourgeois constitutions formally declare that citizens have equal rights, but at the same time, they attach conditions, such as excluding women, or including only a portion of them. These rights, in relation to the working people, are rendered meaningless in practice by numerous conditions and restrictions. Comrade Stalin said: "From the point of view of democracy, bourgeois constitutions can be divided into two categories: The first category of constitutions directly denies equal rights and democratic freedoms to citizens, or in fact renders equal rights and democratic freedoms to citizens meaningless. The second category of constitutions is happy to accept and even flaunt the principles of democracy, but at the same time adds many conditions and restrictions, which damage democratic rights and freedoms beyond recognition." ("Problems of Leninism," Eleventh Edition, page 517)

    Finally, the sixth characteristic of the Stalin Constitution is that the fundamental law not only declares many rights of citizens, but also guarantees their real realization. The right to work is guaranteed by the fact that there is no and will be no unemployment in the Soviet Union, because the socialist economic system does not suffer from economic crises. The rapid development of the Soviet national economy, the continuous growth of the people's purchasing power, and the socialist planning of the national economy—these completely exclude the possibility of crises.

    The guaranteed right to obtain work makes Soviet people truly free people, because true freedom only exists where no one oppresses others, and where there is no unemployment and poverty.

    Soviet democracy—as Lenin said—is democracy that "changes from lies to truth." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 23, page 443)

    For the first time in history, a truly democratic country has emerged, in which all residents are absorbed to actively participate in the political life of the country. "Russia will become the most glorious democratic country on earth." - Gorky said through the mouth of a protagonist in his novel "Mother". This prediction of the great proletarian writer has become a reality.

    In all bourgeois countries, the masses of the people are excluded from participating in the management of the state. Under the Soviet system, the masses of the people are absorbed to "constantly, continuously, and decisively participate in the democratic management of the state." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 13)

    The Stalin Constitution stipulates the most democratic organization of elections for organs of power in the world, from the procedure of nominating candidates and discussing their qualifications to guaranteeing all the conditions that every voter, no matter where they are at the time of the election, can fulfill one of their civic obligations. The entire electoral system of the Soviet Union is permeated with a desire to ensure that the masses are absorbed to the greatest extent to participate in the real management of the state.

    Thirteen years have passed since the adoption of the Stalin Constitution, from December 5, 1936, to December 5, 1949. The great Stalin said in 1936: "How happy and joyful we should be to have this constitution that explains the fruits of our victory, as a result of the struggle and hardship we have gone through. How happy and joyful we should be to know what our people have fought so persistently for and how they have achieved a victory of worldwide historical significance. How happy and joyful we should be to know that the blood shed by our people was not shed in vain, but has produced the results it should have." (Stalin, Problems of Leninism, page 534)

    Hundreds of millions of people around the world see that what the honest people of all countries have dreamed of has been realized in the Soviet Union.

　　斯大林宪法的特点
    Ｍ·巴拉洛夫斯基
    按：今日——十二月五日是苏联斯大林宪法通过十三周年纪念日，特刊此文，以示纪念。
    ——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一九三六年十二月五日第八次全苏联苏维埃非常代表大会批准了苏联宪法。苏联人民依它底创造者的名字，称这个新宪法为——斯大林宪法。
    社会主义国家根本大法底每一个条款，每一个字都闪烁着斯大林的智慧，论叙的简要和明确。这一历史性的文献简洁而扼要地说出了苏联社会主义胜利底事实，苏联劳动者从资本主义奴役下解放底事实，苏维埃国家里真正的社会主义民主——对于劳动者的民主胜利底事实。
    斯大林宪法在立法上固定了许多重大的革新，由于这些革新的结果，苏维埃国家已成为一个具有头等工业、世界上最巨大的农业、最先进文化的社会主义的强国。
    斯大林宪法在精神上武装了苏联劳动者为祖国的利益而进行英勇的忘我的劳动，争取共产主义底新胜利。在斯大林宪法的旗帜下更巩固了苏维埃社会政治道德上的一致，苏联各民族的友爱，生气蓬勃的爱国主义。
    在斯大林宪法的旗帜下，苏维埃人民光荣地经历了伟大的卫国战争的考验，获得了战胜希特勒德国和帝国主义日本的有历史意义的胜利。
    战后时期，由伟大的列宁、斯大林党所领导的苏维埃人民，在经济和文化建设的各方面，都获得了辉煌的成就。战后五年计划之重大任务——是恢复并大大超过战前工业和农业的水平，这种任务基本上已经完成了。
    在第二次世界大战诸年间，法西斯侵略者给苏维埃国家国民经济带来巨大的损害。任何其他最大的国家遭受到如此损害以后，将会退后十年并降为第二等强国的地位。然而，苏维埃国家光荣地保卫了自己的自由和独立，战争以后反而更加强大、更加巩固了。
    苏维埃人民在劳动和战斗中的伟大胜利是苏联社会和国家制度不可战胜的生命力量之明显证明。
    斯大林宪法，有同于任何资本主义国家的宪法，它具有六个基本的特点。
    第一个特点，在于苏联宪法不是规定未来远景的纲领；它是已有的东西，苏维埃人民已达到并已争得的东西在立法上的确定。
    资产阶级的宪法通常是许诺给人民的幸福，事实上在资本主义社会里是没有的。
    第二个特点，在于苏联宪法是从苏联资本主义制度已被消灭和社会主义已获得胜利的事实为出发点。斯大林宪法依靠于社会主义的原则在以立法上巩固苏维埃国家内所已确立的新的真正民主的制度。
    苏联宪法反映了已体现出生活的社会主义底基本原则：土地、森林、工厂，以及其他生产工具与生产资料等之社会主义所有制；剥削与剥削阶级底消灭；旧社会大多数人贫穷和少数人奢侈底消灭；失业底消灭；劳动成为每一个有工作能力的公民底光荣义务和责任；所有公民劳动权、休息权、教育权，及年老或病痛救济金之保证。
    苏联宪法的第三个特点，在于它从以苏维埃社会底道德政治统一底事实为出发点。在苏维埃社会里，没有敌对的阶级；它是由相互友好的工人和农民阶级组成的。苏维埃社会的国家领导权属于工人阶级，即最进步的阶级。
    苏维埃宪法的第四个特点是深深具有国际主义的。苏联的根本法是：一切民族和种族在苏维埃国度里，在社会经济生活、社会生活、国家生活及文化生活方面享有同等的权利。民族和种族底真正平等——是社会主义的法律。任何宣传种族或民族优越性，任何宣传憎恶与蔑视的观点——是要受法律惩罚的。与此相反，资产阶级的宪法却巩固了千百万人的不平等与民族压迫。
    苏联宪法的第五个特点，是她的一贯的彻底的民主主义。斯大林宪法保证一切政权机关从上到下，都是根据最民主的选举制度选举的。所有年满十八岁的公民，都享有一切政权机关中的选举权。
    斯大林宪法允许选举行人有经常监督自己被选人的权利，当代表们不为人民所信任的时候，选举人有罢免代表的权利。
    资产阶级宪法形式上宣布公民有平等权利，但同时又附有条件，即不包括例如：妇女，或者只包括她们一部分。这些权利在对待劳动人民的关系，用了许多附带条件和限制，事实上，也就是化为乌有。斯大林同志说：“从民主主义的观点看来，资产阶级的宪法，可以分为两类：第一类宪法直截了当地否认公民平权和民主自由，或在事实上把公民平权和民主自由化为乌有。另一类宪法，乐意接受、甚至标榜民主主义原则，但同时又加上许多附带条件和限制，而把民主权利与自由损伤无余。”（“列宁主义问题”十一版，第五一七页）
    最后，斯大林宪法的第六个特点在于：根本法不仅宣布了公民的许多权利，而且还保证了它们的真正实现。劳动权是以苏联没有而且也不会有失业为保证的，因为社会主义经济体系不会遭受经济危机。苏联国民经济的飞速发展，人民购买力的不断增长，国民经济的社会主义计划性。——这些就完全排除了危机的可能性。
    获得工作之被保证的权利，使苏维埃人成为真正自由的人，因为真正的自由，只有存在于那没有人压迫人的地方，没有失业和贫穷的地方。
    苏维埃民主，——列宁说，——这便是民主之“从谎言变为实话”。（列宁全集，二十三卷，四四三页）
    历史上第一次发生了真正民主的国家，在这个国家里，一切居民都被吸收来积极在参加国家的政治生活了。“俄罗斯将成为地球上最光明的民主国家。”——高尔基借其小说“母亲”中一个主角之口这样说。这位伟大的无产阶级作家之此一预见已经变为现实了。
    在一切资产阶级国家里，人民大众都被排斥参加国家的管理工作，在苏维埃制度的条件下，人民大众都被吸收“经常地、不断地、而且有决定性地参加国家的民主管理。”（列宁全集，二十四卷，十三页）
    斯大林宪法规定了全世界上最民主的政权机关选举组织，从提出候选人、讨论候选资格之程序起，到保证每一个选举人、不管选举时他在什么地方，都能够履行其公民义务之一切条件为止。苏联的整个选举制度贯穿着一个愿望，那就是最大程度地保证吸收群众来参加国家之真正管理工作。
    自斯大林宪法通过之日起，到一九四九年十二月五日，已满十三年了。伟大的斯大林在一九三六年曾说：“由于已经走过的斗争道路和忍受艰辛的结果，现在得到这一个说明我们胜利果实的宪法，该是如何欢欣快乐呵。知道我们的人究竟为着什么而作了坚忍的奋斗，以及他们怎样获得了有全世界历史意义的胜利，该是如何欢欣快乐呵。知道我们的人所流的血原来没有白流，而是产生了应有的结果，该是如何欢欣快乐呵。”（斯大林，列宁主义问题，第五三四页）
    全世界千百万人都看到，世界一切国家正直人们所幻想的，在苏联已被实现了。
