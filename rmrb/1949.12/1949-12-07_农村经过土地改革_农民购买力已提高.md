　　Rural Areas After Land Reform
　　Farmers' Purchasing Power Has Increased
　　The eagerness of farmer representatives to purchase goods is by no means accidental. It fully illustrates that some people only see one side of the issue when they believe that rural purchasing power has generally declined. They have not seen the other side of the new situation's development: Due to the approaching complete victory of the Liberation War and the implementation of the government's production development policies, and even more so due to the land reform in the vast rural areas of North China, farmers have been emancipated and their political consciousness has been unprecedentedly enhanced. They have a high degree of confidence in agricultural production and construction, and they are actively engaging in cooperative mutual aid and necessary savings. In this way, farmers also have the strength to purchase urgently needed production tools and necessities. With the recovery and development of agricultural production, this strength will increase day by day. Judging from the demands of the farmer representatives' orders this time, the current production situation of Tianjin's existing industries is already difficult to meet rural demands. For example, farmer representatives from various places ordered more than 10,000 waterwheels, but the city only has six waterwheel factories, producing 460 units per month, which will take at least one or two years to deliver all the goods. The North China Grass Weaving Company's grass bag weaving machines, the Minsheng Industrial Cooperative's bellows, the Xinye Factory's grinding wheels, and the Yuzhong Photography Equipment Company's dry plates, although they have received large orders, are unable to undertake the production due to limited production capacity and funds. There are only three factories manufacturing chemical fertilizers. Although fertilizer prices are expensive, due to the small output, supply still falls short of demand. In addition to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in Beijing, there are only three factories in Tianjin that manufacture new-style agricultural tools, which can only manufacture single-handle plows, corn threshers, and rice threshers, with extremely low output, also falling short of demand. Other items, such as Huang Yufu's steam rotary machines, flour mills, free-style oil presses, and insecticides such as pyrethrum, nicotine, fish oil, emulsions, and arsenic lime, can only be said to have been invented and created, but have not yet been built into factories for production, so that the farmers' needs cannot be met for the time being. All of this shows that the industrial and commercial sectors must vigorously invest in industries oriented towards rural areas to serve the motherland's economic construction.
　　Two, another major gain of the industrial exhibition is the proposal and initial resolution of problems existing in urban-rural trade. Farmer representatives unanimously raised the issue of slow sales of local products and raw materials, while many factories and businesses in Tianjin felt a lack of raw materials. For example, chemical plants lacked mirabilite and went to the Northeast to purchase it, but various places had 40 million catties of mirabilite in storage that could not be sold; paper mills lacked raw materials, while the reeds in the Bohai area and other places were so abundant that they could not be sold, and some were even used as fuel... These illustrate the existence of great blindness in urban-rural trade. After repeated discussions and research between farmer representatives from various places and the Tianjin industrial and commercial sectors, unanimous opinions have been reached on how to solve the problem.

### 农村经过土地改革  农民购买力已提高

　　农村经过土地改革
    农民购买力已提高
    农民代表如此踊跃购货，决不是偶然的，它充分说明有些人认为农村购买力一般下降，只是看到问题的一面，没有看见新形势发展的另一面：由于解放战争接近全面胜利和政府发展生产政策的贯彻，更由于华北广大农村经过土地改革，农民翻身，农民政治觉悟空前提高，对农业生产建设具有高度信心，他们正积极进行合作互助及必要的节约，这样农民也就有力量购买迫切需要的生产工具和必需品，随着农业生产的恢复发展，这种力量将与日俱增。根据这次农民代表订货的要求来看，天津现有工业的生产情况，即已很难满足农村要求。如：各地农民代表共订购水车一万余辆，全市只有六个造水车的厂子，每月出产水车四百六十台，至少需一二年才能全部交货。华北草织公司的织草袋机、民生工业社的风匣、新业工厂的砂轮、裕中摄影器材公司的干板等，虽接到大批定货，但为生产能力及资金所限，不敢承制。制造化学肥料的厂子只有三家，肥料价格虽贵，由于产量小，仍然供不应求。制造新式农具的除了北京的华北农业机械总厂外，津市只有三家，仅能制造单把犁、玉米脱粒机、打稻机三种，产量极微，亦供不应求。其他如黄玉符的蒸气旋转机、磨粉机、自由式榨油机及除虫菊、烟精、鱼油、乳剂、砒石灰等杀虫剂，只能说已经发明创造出来，尚未建厂生产，以致对农民的要求一时仍无法满足。这一切，说明工商业界必须大力投资于面向农村的行业，为祖国经济建设服务。
    二、工展的另一个主要收获是提出并初步解决了城乡贸易中存在的问题。农民代表一致提出土产及原料滞销的情况，津市许多厂、商则感到原料缺乏。如化学厂因缺乏芒硝、曾到东北去购买，但各地即存有芒硝四千万斤销不出去；造纸厂缺乏原料，渤海区等地的苇子则多的无法推销，有的甚至拿作燃料……这些说明城乡贸易存在很大的盲目性。经过各地农民代表与天津工商界多次座谈研究，对于如何解决，已获一致意见。（详情见另文）
