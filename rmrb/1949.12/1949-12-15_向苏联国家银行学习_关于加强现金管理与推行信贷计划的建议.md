Learning from the State Bank of the Soviet Union
Suggestions on Strengthening Cash Management and Promoting Credit Plans
Wang Qizhi

　　The State Bank of the Soviet Union is a center for cash, credit, and settlements. Almost all working capital of national institutions and enterprises is concentrated in the State Bank. The bank formulates credit plans based on the use of funds by various departments and enterprises: all receipts and payments between institutions and enterprises must be settled through the State Bank, so the bank has three types of settlement: mutual settlement, planned settlement, and offsetting settlement.

　　Such a bank plays a significant role in the development of the national economy and the adjustment of finance, and can guarantee the completion of national economic construction and financial construction according to the planned schedule. Therefore, the Soviet government stipulates by law that the State Bank has the following tasks:

　　1. The State Bank should become the accounting organ of the socialist economy, calculating the national production and distribution.

　　2. Truly supervise the implementation of commodity production and circulation plans, supervise the implementation of financial plans, and the accumulation process in the socialist economy.

　　3. Ensure the consolidation of the "economic responsibility system" (or independent accounting system) of enterprises, as the main "lever" for the execution of plans (quantitative and qualitative plan tasks) in all components of the socialist economy.

　　Why can the State Bank undertake such tasks? Because all income and expenditure activities of each enterprise and institution are reflected in the bank, the State Bank is most convenient to examine the financial income and expenditure of each enterprise and institution, and the development of the enterprise relies on bank credit support, and the financial plan relies on bank supervision to guarantee. Furthermore, the speed of capital turnover and the level of costs will quickly and inevitably be exposed in the bank's credit relationship. Therefore, the regular work of the bank must understand the capital turnover situation and material reserve situation of each enterprise and each department, and under the direct credit system, it has the right to strictly supervise the use of debtors, and provide timely support for production funds according to different seasons and the needs of debtors, formulate a credit preferential system, and promote production enterprise and production enthusiasm.

　　The Northeast State Bank is the hub of the Northeast state-owned economy. The state-owned economy belongs to the socialist nature, so there is no doubt that we should learn from the Soviet Union and make the bank a center for cash, credit, and settlements. Only in this way can the Northeast Bank, according to the overall financial and economic policy of the Northeast, guarantee the victorious completion of economic construction and financial construction, and play the role that the bank should play in the new democratic economic construction.

　　On April 19th of this year, the Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated a "Cash Management Method for Institutions and Enterprises" in order to systematically supply materials and regulate the circulation of cash. It stipulates that: (1) Units designated to be bound by this method must compile a monthly income and expenditure plan two days before the end of each month, and send it to the Accounting Bureau, which will be reviewed by the General Accounting Bureau and submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee for approval and implementation; (2) All cash income of each unit must be deposited into the Northeast Bank in full according to the plan, and the necessary cash expenditures shall be paid by the Northeast Bank according to the plan; (3) The cash stored by each unit shall not exceed the prescribed amount (the specific amount shall be separately stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee according to different periods and different circumstances), and the excess shall be deposited into the Northeast Bank; (4) The materials needed by each unit must first be purchased from public stores, and only when public stores cannot supply them, are they allowed to purchase freely in the market.

　　After this method was implemented, the bank's cash reserves increased by 260%, deposits increased by 200%, and loans increased by 300% in the six months from April to October. This shows that after the implementation of cash management, the bank's credit scope has expanded. In the future, the bank should truly become a cash "reservoir" for all institutions and enterprises, and this "reservoir" should increase its storage capacity with the strengthening of cash management, especially the increase in this storage capacity should gradually rise, circulate endlessly, and be inexhaustible, which plays a great role in developing production, prospering the economy, stabilizing prices, and solving financial problems.

　　However, as of now, very few units are subject to cash management, the scope of cash management is not wide enough, and some large state-owned enterprises are still outside the scope of cash management, freely disposing of cash; the phenomenon of wasting cash payments is still very serious.

　　Of course, to do a good job in cash management, this is not just a simple issue of restricting cash payments, but to establish bank credit plans and liquidation procedures at the same time, and use them in combination, the effect of cash management will be greater.

　　Therefore, the main task of the State Bank in the future is to formulate income and expenditure plans according to the income and expenditure situation and needs of various institutions and enterprises (the plan must be approved by the Finance Committee), so that all institutions and enterprises can be consciously combined through the bank to become a financial hub of a national planned economic whole. Especially important is that the enterprise sector must gradually change its production supply composition, establish an independent accounting system, and give play to the rationalization and enthusiasm of the enterprise; otherwise, a precise cost accounting system will be difficult to establish. For example, coal production has achieved success this year, and the workers' enthusiasm for labor is high, but too much coal is accumulated and cannot be sold completely. The reason for the accumulation of coal is not because of overproduction, but because there are too many stones in the coal and it cannot be exported. This forms the phenomenon of large output, poor quality, large backlog, and inability to sell. If the management method of the supply system is not changed in the future, the state will only continue to supply funds according to the requirements of the production department, resulting in the deterioration of coal storage, consumption and waste, capital backlog, inflexible turnover, and the cost of coal will become higher and higher. According to the experience of the Soviet Union, the coal production department directly supplies coal to the coal-using departments (such as railways, factories, cooperative headquarters, and commercial departments) according to the different varieties, quality, prices, and quantities required. First, both parties must reach an agreement and submit the agreement to the State Planning Bureau for approval, and then the coal production department, the coal-using department, and the State Bank will jointly carry out the agreement. Under the mutual cooperation and mutual constraints of the three parties, each fulfills its responsibilities to jointly overcome all unreasonable phenomena in production, distribution, and capital turnover.

　　Therefore, the work of the bank is inseparable from the cooperation of implementing the cost accounting system. At the same time, the national planned economy also proposes amendments and supplements based on the production synthesis reported by the bank's income and expenditure plan and the independent accounting of each enterprise, and then formulates the overall national plan. And this overall plan is based on and guaranteed, and is more reliable, not "visual estimation."

　　After the state has a complete and comprehensive plan, it will be checked separately on schedule, and those who complete the plan and exceed the plan in production will be rewarded, and those who fail to complete the plan and cause waste will be criticized. In this way, the phenomenon of waste in production can naturally be reduced.

　　The bank must consider its coordinating position and role in responding to the call to implement enterprise production and strengthen the cost accounting system today; naturally, it should also recognize that the foundation of the bank's general standardization is still incomplete, its strength is insufficient, and its experience is lacking. But it must never give up its due strength and responsibility because of this. Therefore, it is proposed to further expand the implementation of cash management, and it is recommended to quickly change the production supply component, promote the establishment of an independent accounting system in the enterprise sector, realize the bank's credit plan, and play a mutually supportive role in economic development. Of course, there may still be different views today and some specific difficulties in future work. However, this is the direction of the State Bank's future work, and we must be ideologically prepared for this work, prepare to meet this new task, and be determined to learn from the Soviet Union and make the bank a center for cash, credit, and settlements, and strive to catch up with the State Bank of the Soviet Union in the near future.

### 向苏联国家银行学习　关于加强现金管理与推行信贷计划的建议

　　向苏联国家银行学习
    关于加强现金管理与推行信贷计划的建议
    王企之
    苏联国家银行是现金中心、信用中心与结算中心。全国各机关与各企业的周转金，几乎都集中到国家银行里。银行根据各部门各企业的资金用途，订出信贷计划：一切机关和企业间的收付，都必须经过国家银行来进行结算，所以银行有三种结算：相互结算、计划结算、抵销结算。
    这样的银行，对国家经济的发展和金融的调剂上，具有重大作用，而且可以保证国家经济建设、财政建设，按照预定计划如期完成。因此，苏联政府以法令规定国家银行有下列任务：
    一、国家银行应成为社会主义经济的会计机关，计算生产和分配的全国性的机关。
    二、真正实行监督商品生产和流通计划底执行过程，监督财政计划底执行和社会主义经济中的积累过程。
    三、保证各企业底“经济责成制”（或独立会计制）底巩固，作为全部社会主义经济成份中执行计划（数量和质量计划任务）的主要“杠杆”。
    为什么国家银行能负起这样的任务？因为各企业各机关的一切收支活动都表现在银行里，国家银行最便于审查各企业各机关的财务收支状况，而企业的发展又是依靠银行信贷来支持，财务计划依靠银行监督来保证。又如资金流转的缓急，成本的高低，也会很快地和不能避免的要在银行信贷关系上暴露出来。因此银行的经常工作必需了解每一企业每一部门的资金周转情形，材料储备情形，在直接信贷的制度下有权严格地监督债务人的用途，并根据不同的季节与债务人的需要，适时地予以生产资金的支持，制定信贷优待制度，推进生产企业化和生产积极性。
    东北的国家银行是东北国营经济的枢纽。国营经济是属于社会主义性质的，因此毫无疑问的，我们要学习苏联，使银行成为现金中心、信用中心与结算中心。只有这样，东北银行才能有计划的根据东北总的财经方针，保证经济建设、财政建设的胜利完成，才能发挥银行在新民主主义经济建设中应起的作用。
    今年四月十九日东北行政委员会为了有计划的供应物资及调节现金的流通起见，曾颁布过一个“机关及企业现金管理办法”。其中规定了：（１）凡指定归本办法约束之单位，须于每月月底前两天编制下月份收支计划，送会计局，经过总会计局审核，提请财经委员会批准执行；（２）各单位一切现金收入必须依照计划全部存入东北银行，必须的现金支出，按计划由东北银行支付；（３）各单位所存现金，不得超过规定数目（具体数目由财经委员会按不同时期，不同情况分别规定）其超过规定部分，尽数交存东北银行；（４）各单位需用之物资，必须首先向公营商店购买，只在公营商店不能供给时，方准在市场自由购买。
    此一办法实行后，银行从四月到十月的半年中，库存现金增加百分之二六○，存款额增加百分之二○○，放款额增加百分之三○○。这是说明实行现金管理后，银行的信贷范围就扩大了。今后银行应该真正成为一切机关及企业的现金“储水池”，而这个“储水池”要随着现金管理的加强，而增加其储水量，特别是这个储水量的增加是逐步上升，循环不已，用之不竭，这对发展生产，繁荣经济，平稳物价，解决财政问题，起着莫大的作用。
    但是截至现在为止，现金管理受到约束的单位还很少，现金管理的范围还不广，若干大的国营企业，还处在现金管理的范围以外，自由支配现金；浪费现金支付现象，还很严重。
    当然，要想把现金管理工作做好，这不仅是单纯的约束现金支付问题，而是要把银行信贷计划，清算手续，同时建立起来，结合运用，现金管理的效果才会更大。
    因此，国家银行今后的主要任务，是要根据各机关及各企业的收支情况和需要，订立收支计划（计划要财委会批准），使一切机关及企业都经过银行有意识的互相结合起来，成为一个国家计划经济整体的金融枢纽。尤其重要的，是企业部门必须逐渐改变生产供给性的成份，建立独立会计制度，发挥企业的合理化与积极性，否则精密的成本会计制度是很难建立起来的。例如煤炭生产，今年增产是有成绩的，工人劳动热情是高涨的，但是积煤过多，不能全部推销。积煤原因，不是因为生产过剩，而是煤中石块太多，不能出口。这样就形成产量大，质量差，积压多，无法推销的现象。今后如不改变供给制的管理方式，则国家只有根据生产部门的要求继续供给资金，结果存煤变质，消耗浪费，资金积压，周转不灵，煤的成本也就愈来愈高了。根据苏联的经验，产煤部门是直接按照用煤部门（例如铁路、工厂、合作总社、商业部等）所需不同的品种、质量、价格、数量来供给用煤，首先须双方取得协议，并将协议送请国家计划局批准，然后分别由产煤部门、用煤部门、国家银行三方面共同按照协议来进行。在三方面相互配合，相互约束下进行，各尽各自责任，以共同克服生产、分配、资金流转中一切不合理现象。
    因此银行工作，是与贯彻成本核算制度的配合分不开的。同时国家计划经济也是根据银行收支计划和名个企业独立会计所报的生产综合，提出修改与补充意见，再制定国家总的计划。而这个总的计划，才有根据、有保证，才是比较可靠的、而不是“目测”的。
    国家有了总的完整的计划之后，按期分别检查，在生产中完成计划，超过计划者奖励之，未完成计划造成浪费者批评之。这样，生产中的浪费现象，自然可以减少了。
    银行必须考虑在响应号召贯彻生产企业化加强成本核算制度的今天，所处的配合地位和作用如何；自然也该认识到今天银行一般地正规化的基础还不完备，力量不足，经验缺乏，这都是事实。但决不能因此而放弃其应尽的力量和责任。所以提出进一步扩大实行现金管理，和建议迅速改变生产供给性的成份，推动企业部门建立独立会计制度，实现银行信贷计划，发挥发展经济中相互配合作用。当然在今天可能还存在着不同的看法和在将来工作中还会存在着若干的具体困难问题。但，这是国家银行今后工作努力的方向，必须从思想上对这一工作有所准备，准备迎接这一新的任务，决心学习苏联，做到银行是现金中心、信用中心、结算中心，力求在不久的将来能与苏联国家银行看齐。（转载东北日报）
