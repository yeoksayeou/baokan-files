　　After the Peking University Faculty and Student Representative Meeting

　　Professors Review Political Studies
　　Develop Study Plans with Students
　　[This Newspaper's Report] After the Peking University Faculty and Student Representative Meeting, faculty and students are working hard to implement the resolutions of the meeting and "further transform our studies." Professors are taking the lead in reviewing their past political studies and proposing guarantees to implement the spirit of the representative meeting. Professor Jin Tao, who is over sixty years old, said, "Although I am old, I will not fall behind and will also issue a challenge." At the department-wide meeting of the Civil Engineering Department and in the large political class, the department head, Chen Shihua, first reviewed himself, then he said: "The Peking University Faculty and Student Representative Meeting is over, but the work left to us is to implement the resolutions and improve our studies. This time, I guarantee to take the lead, to further unite teachers and students through reviewing, and to summarize the learning achievements of the past six months through the final exam." The political instructor, Yang Zengyi, also frankly reviewed that his past role as a political teacher was based on an employment perspective, and his understanding of the work of ideological transformation was not clear enough. Professor representative Li Songchen, who attended the Faculty and Student Representative Meeting, also said that his attitude towards learning political classes was not active enough, always using the excuse of being busy with work and having little time. But today he understands that the past busyness was not understanding the correct working methods, not understanding the Marxist-Leninist working methods. If one does not study political classes well, I am afraid one will always be busy without a plan or a clue. Other professors and teaching assistants have also reviewed that their political class group's connection with thinking was not enough, only saying, "This document is very correct, I agree with it." Sometimes, the knowledge and insights gained during studying in the United States were not criticized, so political studies were not done well enough. But this will be the past, and we must move forward rapidly in the future.
　　Now, under the leadership of the department head, the Civil Engineering Department, professors, teaching assistants, and students are jointly formulating study plans. The department head and several teachers enthusiastically guide students in their studies. And they have issued a challenge to other departments, to "consolidate the foundation, teachers and students jointly summarize learning, guarantee to teach thoroughly, and guarantee to learn thoroughly."

　　北大师生代表会议后
　  教授检讨政治学习
　  和同学一道定出温书计划
    【本报讯】北京大学举行师生代表会议后，师生正为贯彻大会决议，“更进一步改造我们的学习”而努力。教授们首先带头，纷纷检讨以往的政治学习，提出贯彻代表会议精神的保证。六十多岁的金涛教授说：“我年纪虽大，但决不落后，也要提出挑战。”土木系的师生大会和政治课大班上，系主任陈士骅，首先检讨了自己，接着他说：“北大的师生代表会议是结束了，但留给我们的工作，是贯彻决议，搞好学习。这一次我保证要带头，从温书中进一步团结师生，从期考中来总结这半年的学习成果。”政治教员杨曾艺亦率直的检讨了自己过去担任政治课是从雇佣观点出发，对改造思想的工作认识还不太明确。出席师生代表会议的教授代表李颂琛亦说出自己学政治课的态度是不够积极的，老是借口工作忙、时间少，但今天明白了，过去的忙是不懂得正确的工作方法，不懂得马列主义的工作方法，假如要不学好政治课，恐怕永远是无计划、无头绪的忙。其他的教授讲助们，也都检讨了自己的政治课小组联系思想作得不够，只是说“这个文件说的很对，我很同意。”有时候对在美国留学时的所学所见不加批判，所以政治学习搞得还不够。但是这将是过去的了，以后一定要急步前进。
    现在土木系在系主任的领导下，教授讲助和同学一块订立温书计划，系主任和几位先生热忱地指导同学温书。并且向旁的系级发出挑战书，要“稳扎稳打，师生共同总结学习，保证教懂，保证学通。”
