Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 6th:

　　The water and land transportation, postal, and telecommunications services in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in the Central South region are rapidly recovering and developing. The main lines of highways, railways, and shipping centered on Wuhan have been largely repaired. These highways, railways, and shipping routes are undertaking the great mission of supporting the frontlines in South and Southwest China and facilitating the exchange of materials between regions.

    Highways and Railways: Up to now, the four provinces have restored over 12,300 kilometers of highways to traffic, with another 6,900 kilometers under construction and repair. Except for some remote mountainous areas, all parts of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces are accessible by cars and horse-drawn carriages, making transportation extremely convenient. Many of these highways were severely damaged by the retreating Kuomintang forces. During the restoration, the four provinces mobilized over 900,000 laborers and overcame various difficulties, such as harassment and sabotage by bandits and secret agents, to quickly restore these damaged highways to traffic.

    Of the railways in the four provinces, there are the Longhai, Jinghan, Yuehan, Zhegan, Nanxun, Xianguiqian lines. Except for the Xianguiqian line, which was severely damaged by the retreating Bai Chongxi bandit troops and is still under repair, and the Yuehan line from Xian County to Qujiang section and the Zhegan line from Zhangshu to Pingxiang section which are under repair, the rest have been fully restored to traffic. These railways were all repaired by the employees of the various railway bureaus and the Railway Corps after liberation. During the rush repairs, they demonstrated the spirit of unity and creativity as masters of the country, launched competitions, and enabled these railways to resume traffic as scheduled or ahead of schedule. Now, the employees of each railway line are working hard to ensure on-time operation, reduce turnaround time, and increase transportation efficiency. The speed of trains on the Jinghan, Longhai, and Yuehan lines has exceeded the pre-liberation levels, allowing for smooth transportation of large quantities of military, passenger, and freight. According to incomplete statistics from a section of the Jinghan Railway within Henan and Hubei provinces over four months, trains traveled more than 363,000 kilometers. The number of train services gradually increased from an average of three pairs of trains per day in August to an average of eight pairs of trains per day now. At the busiest times, eleven pairs of trains were running in one day.

    Shipping: The damage to the shipping industry in the four provinces by the Kuomintang bandit gangs was even more severe than that to highways and railways. The docks, lighthouses, and navigation markers along the Yangtze River, as well as the original patrol boats, survey boats, pontoons, and other vessels, were mostly destroyed and sunk in the river by the Bai Chongxi bandit troops. The ferry terminals in Wuhan were also damaged. However, on the eve of liberation, the Wuhan sailors and dockworkers in various places along the river, who had a tradition of heroic struggle, tried every means to risk dispersing and hiding some of the ships and equipment under the threat of the bandit gang's machine guns and bayonets. After liberation, they returned to their original ports one after another and, under the leadership of the Wuhan Military Control Commission, carried out the work of salvaging sunken ships and repairing ships and docks, enabling the Central China shipping centered on Wuhan to be partially restored in early June. Up to now, the shipping traffic on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Han River, Xiang River, Yuan River, Gan River, and other rivers has basically been fully restored, and together with highways and railways, it has shouldered the arduous task of supporting the People's Liberation Army's frontlines and exchanging materials between regions. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six months, a total of more than 2,500 large and small ships have entered and exited the waters of Wuhan, carrying more than 14.98 million tons of military and commercial materials and more than 660,000 passengers.

    Postal and Telecommunications: The postal and telecommunications services in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces have recovered the fastest due to the active protection of postal and telecommunications workers before liberation and their intense work after liberation. Up to now, in addition to the fact that major and medium-sized cities and some small cities have interconnected wired and wireless telegraphs and long-distance telephones, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in Henan Province, Wuhan, Shashi, and Yichang in Hubei Province, Changsha and Hengyang in Hunan Province, and Nanchang and Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province have all interconnected telegrams and telephones with major cities across the country. The postal routes in the four provinces have also been largely restored and are fully connected with postal services throughout the country. Larger post offices have successively started handling remittances, mutual parcel delivery, registered letters, insured mail, and subscription services for books and newspapers between major cities and towns across the country from September and October. According to statistics from the Hubei Provincial Postal Administration, the total amount of remittances handled by the bureau in October was 556.976 billion yuan, an increase of more than double compared to September. The Hankou Post Office received and sent 7,732 parcels in October, weighing more than 178,000 kilograms, which is equivalent to the total number of parcels received and sent by the bureau in June, July, August, and September. This shows that it has played a significant role in connecting urban and rural areas and promoting the exchange of materials.

　　中南区豫鄂湘赣四省
  　交通邮电大部恢复
    对支援前线和交流物资起重大作用
    【新华社汉口六日电】中南区河南、湖北、湖南、江西等四省的水陆交通和邮政、电讯事业，正在迅速地恢复和发展。以武汉为中心的公路、铁路和航运的主要干线，均已大部修复；这些公路、铁路和航运，担负了对华南、西南前线的支援和各地物资交流的伟大使命。
    公路铁路方面：迄目前为止，四省现已修复通车的公路达一万二千三百余公里，还有六千九百余公里正在开辟和整修。现豫、鄂、赣、湘四省除部分偏僻山区外，均通汽车、马车，交通极便。上述许多公路都曾被溃退的国民党破坏得支离破碎，在修复中，四省前后动员的民工达九十余万人，并克服了土匪、特务的骚扰破坏等种种困难，才使这些被破坏的公路迅速恢复通车。
    公路铁路
    四省的铁路有陇海、京汉、粤汉、浙赣、南浔、湘桂黔等线，其中除湘桂黔线遭白崇禧匪部溃退时严重破坏尚待修复，粤汉县郴县到曲江段和浙赣线樟树到萍乡段正在修复以外，其余均已全部修复通车。这些铁路都是由各铁路局的员工和铁道兵团在解放后赶工修复的。抢修中，他们都以国家主人翁的身份发挥了团结创造的精神，展开竞赛，使这些铁路都能如期或提前恢复通车。现在各铁路线的员工，正在为按点行车和减低行车周转率，为增加运输效能而紧张工作。京汉、陇海、粤汉三线的行车速度，都已超过了解放前的水平，使大批军、客、货运，得以畅通南北。仅据京汉铁路河南、湖北境内一段四个月的不完全统计：列车运转达三十六万三千多公里，行车次数由八月份的每日平均开行三对车，逐渐增加到现在每日平均开行八对。运输最繁忙时，一天中曾开行过十一对列车。
    航运事业
    四省的航运事业遭受国民党匪帮的破坏，较之公路、铁路尤为严重。沿长江的码头、灯塔和标桩等设备，以及原有的巡江轮、测量艇、趸船以及其他船舶，大部被白崇禧匪部毁沉江中；武汉市的轮渡码头，也遭破坏。但在解放前夕，有英勇斗争传统的武汉海员和沿江各地的码头工人，在匪帮的机枪和刺刀威胁下，想尽一切办法，冒险疏散和隐藏了一部分船只和器材。解放后，他们就纷纷驶返原港，并在武汉军管会领导下，进行打捞沉船和修复船只、码头的工作，使以武汉为中心的华中航运，于六月初即部分恢复。截至目前为止，长江中段和汉水、湘江、沅江、赣江等河流的航运交通，基本上已全部恢复通航，与公路铁路并肩担负了支援人民解放军前线和交流各地物资的艰巨任务。据不完全统计，半年来，进出武汉水面的大小轮船共达二千五百余艘，载运军商物资一千四百九十八万余吨和乘客六十六万余人。
    邮政电信
    豫、鄂、湘、赣的邮政、电信事业在邮、电职工解放前的积极保护和解放后的紧张工作下，恢复最快。截至目前为止，除各大、中城市及一部分小城市已互通有线、无线电报和长途电话以外，河南省的郑州、开封，湖北省的武汉、沙市、宜昌，湖南省的长沙、衡阳，江西省的南昌、九江等地均已与全国各大城市互通电报、电话。四省的邮路亦早已大部恢复，并与全国各地全面通邮。较大的邮局已于九、十月起，陆续与全国各大城镇之间，办理汇兑、互寄包裹、报值函件、保价邮件、代订书报等业务。据湖北省邮政管理局的统计，十月份该局承汇款项总额为五千五百六十九亿七千六百万元，较九月份增加一倍以上。十月份汉口邮局收寄包裹达七千七百三十二件，计重十七万八千余公斤，相等于该局六、七、八、九四个月收寄包裹的总数。这说明对于沟通城乡内外关系，促进物资交流，起了重大的作用。
