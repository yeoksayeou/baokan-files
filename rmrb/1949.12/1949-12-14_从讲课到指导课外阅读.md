　　From Lecturing to Guiding Extracurricular Reading
　　Liu Qihuan

　　Having always used the injection-style "parsing sentences and extracting phrases" lecturing method, I initially felt very unfamiliar and embarrassed with today's teaching—especially Chinese language teaching.

　　After the summer vacation, I encountered many difficulties when I started teaching junior high school Chinese (published by Xinhua Bookstore). Initially, when lecturing, I very carefully and earnestly analyzed and explained the content of the text to the students. After finishing the lecture, the students had no reaction, and I myself thought it was very satisfactory and successful.

　　Two weeks later, they suddenly offered me direct opinions, saying, "The content of the text is simple and easy to understand, so we can understand it without lecturing." "Only a dozen or so lessons are taught in a semester, and the quality is low, so there is not much to gain from learning." "No extracurricular reading range is specified, so we don't know what books to read." ... Even during the Chinese language group meetings, students from other classes constantly raised similar opinions. Their attitude towards learning Chinese is serious enough, and their thirst for knowledge is very urgent. How can I not disappoint their learning spirit and meet their needs? This question had been swirling in my mind for an unknown amount of time.

　　Regarding the content of the text, some articles are indeed very simple and easy to understand, so it is no wonder they feel unsatisfied; at the same time, my lecturing method is indeed too outdated and rigid, so how can it arouse their interest in learning? As for the quality of the text and extracurricular reading problems, I also deeply felt that the allocation and guidance were insufficient. I repeatedly researched these problems, while trying my best to find some concrete, vivid, and lively materials related to the text; at the same time, I was planning a lively teaching method.

　　So, when I taught again, in addition to clearly explaining the content of the text, I especially focused on correctly introducing the biography of the author or the central character of the text and extracurricular reference materials. For example, when teaching "Receiving Honorable Guests," a story about Chairman Mao warmly receiving peasants, I also told about Chairman Mao's life: how he studied and how he bravely engaged in revolution, and at the same time introduced them to several biographical books about Chairman Mao, such as "Mao Zedong's Youth" (edited by Xiao San), "The Autobiography of Mao Zedong" (written by Snow), and "A Brief Biography of Comrade Mao Zedong" (edited by Xiao San), and let them read them extracurricularly. Similarly, when teaching "Lenin and the Blacksmith," a story about Lenin treating the blacksmith with generosity, I also told about the important facts of Lenin's revolution and his childhood life and study, and also introduced relevant books about Lenin, such as "Lenin's Childhood" (written by Yelyutinikov, translated by Jin Ren), "Lenin's Stories" (written by Zoshchenko, translated by Cao Jinghua), "Lenin: A Biography" (edited by Ruth Shaw, translated by Ling Shan), and "Lenin" (written by Yaroslavsky, translated by Mo Wen). For example, when teaching "Little Devils in the Red Army," the exercises at the end of this text pointed out that we should collect the heroic deeds of children in the People's Revolutionary War, and this can introduce them to reading books such as "Stories of the Long March of the Red Army" (edited by Gao Langting et al.), "The Story of a Woman's Liberation" (written by Kong Jue), and "The Bugler" (written by Rodan). As for when introducing each book, we must concisely extract the wonderful fragments of the content of each book, like showing exciting scenes in a movie, to arouse their high reading emotions and motivate them to read extracurricularly.

　　I conducted three lessons like this, and when I asked the students again, they all felt more satisfied than before. They said, "The content of the text is richer, the quality has improved, and we can read many good articles outside of the text." Their interest in learning Chinese has generally increased. As a result, I saw them rushing to borrow books in the library, and some even spent money to buy them themselves. After class, I often heard them shouting "Lenin," "Mao Zedong's Youth"... and when writing essays, I also saw that they had materials to write about. A young student reflected in "A Letter," "When I was in elementary school, I was not interested in the national language. Even after entering middle school, I didn't feel any interest in Chinese at the beginning of the school year. Recently, the Chinese teacher has made some supplements to extracurricular activities and told stories about meaningful books, so I have recently developed a strong interest in Chinese." They are studying so seriously that they no longer feel the dryness of "simple text," "low quality," or "no books to read."

　　From the above experiment, I gained a new inspiration: that is, starting from lecturing and introducing extracurricular books such as biographies, and extending to widely guiding their extracurricular reading—this is an important issue related to cultivating their correct thinking and instilling fresh knowledge; especially cultivating their correct thinking, the introduction of a great biography is directly a thought education. In the book "Ideological and Political Education of Soviet Students," Smirnov emphasized in a report on "Ideological and Political Education in Literary Reading Teaching": "The biographies included in the literary reading course are first of all biographies with ideological education topics, ... They have a great educational impact. Although there is only a brief article of his biography in the literary reading course, it has great educational significance. This is a hero of our time, this is a model of our students' character; he is such a person, he aroused great surprise with his boundless energy and his infinite loyalty to the cause of the people and the cause of the revolution, and it is great to use his biography in schools - this is a great educational work." Biographies are valued in this way in the literary reading class in the Soviet Union. We will not only use this lively lecturing method, but also get a magic weapon for conducting ideological education.

　　Secondly, widely guiding extracurricular reading is of course a very important thing. Elementary school students who have just entered middle school and are only in their teens are still children. They are very eager to read fresh children's reading materials. In the several children's libraries currently published, we should select and introduce a large number of them, which is of great significance to them. Mr. Lu Xun said: "For the new children, it is necessary to give them new works, so that they face the ever-changing new world and continue to flourish and grow." (In the preface to the table) This is a very clear instruction.

　　As for our wide guidance of extracurricular reading, in the new books, we should not only limit them to reading literary books as listed above, but also guide them to read more science books in a planned way, because literary books and science books are inseparable. Gorky said, "There should be no clear boundary between literary books and popular science books." Lu Xun further elaborated in a letter to Yan Limin, a young man who asked him for advice, "It is not good to only read literary books. The former literary youths often disliked mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, geography, and biology, thinking that these were insignificant. Later, they became even ignorant of common sense. They did not understand the study of literature, and they were confused when writing articles themselves. So I hope you do not let go of science and immerse yourselves in literature alone." This is such a clear instruction.

　　Now, according to the scientific reading materials suitable for students to read, we can select several types using the classification method: for example

　　For reading about economics, you can choose:
　　"Lectures on Juvenile Economics" (written by Cui Shangxin, published by Kaiming Bookstore)
　　"Stories of the Five-Year Plan" (written by Ilyin, translated by Dong Chuncai, published by Kaiming Bookstore) ... and other books.

　　For reading about history, you can choose:
　　"A History of Modern World Revolutions" (compiled by Chen Guangzu, published by Northeast Bookstore)
　　"A History of China" (written by Xu Liqun, published by Northeast Bookstore)
　　"Lectures on the History of the War of Resistance Against Japan" (written by Zhu Zefu, published by Guanghua Bookstore)
　　"Lectures on the History of Modern China" (written by Han Qinong, published by Guanghua Bookstore) and other books.

　　For reading about geography, you can choose:
　　"The Story of Navigation" (written by Liu Huru, published by Kaiming Bookstore)
　　"Man and the Mountain" (written by Ilyin, translated by Dong Chuncai, published by Kaiming Bookstore)
　　"The World's Major Cities" (written by Hu Zhongchi, published by New China Bookstore)
　　"Northwest" "Yellow River" (written by Cai Junqi, published by Guanghua Bookstore) and other books.

　　For reading about physics and chemistry, you can choose:
　　"A Tour of the Physical World" (written by De Geer, translated by Gu Junzheng, published by Kaiming)
　　"Water" (written by Chen Danian, published by Northeast Bookstore) and other books.

　　For reading about biology, you can choose:
　　"Biological Anecdotes" (written by Fabre, translated by Song Yi, published by Guanghua Bookstore)
　　"Animal Treasures" (written by Fox, translated by Qi Hewen, published by Guanghua Bookstore)
　　"A Dog's Story" (written by Tolstoy, translated by Chen Yuan, published by Guanghua Bookstore)
　　"Phoenix Butterfly Anecdotes" (written by Dong Chuncai, published by Northeast Bookstore)
　　"Weeds in the Field" (written by Zhou Jianren, published by New China Bookstore)

　　For reading about physiology and hygiene, you can choose:
　　"Man and Disease" (written by Peng Zhaoqing, published by Xinhua Bookstore)
　　"Bacteria and Man" (written by Gao Shiqi, published by Kaiming Bookstore)

　　For reading about engineering, you can choose:
　　"The Autobiography of a Soviet Aircraft Designer" (written by Yakovlev, published by Xinhua Bookstore)
　　"How Cars Run" (written by Ilyin, translated by Fu Qixun et al., published by Kaiming Bookstore) and other books.

　　For reading about general aspects of natural science, you can choose:
　　"People's Science Series" (total of twelve types, published by Tianxia Book Company)
　　"One Hundred Thousand Whys" "Black and White" ("Black and White" is also known as "The Story of the Book," with the Hu Yuzhi translation being the best, published by Shenghuo Bookstore.) "Sleepless Day" (The Story of the Lamp) "What Time Is It" (all four books written by Ilyin, translated by Dong Chuncai, published by Kaiming Bookstore)
　　"Science and Daily Life" (written by Hayden, translated by Chen Yuan, published by Shenghuo Bookstore) and other books. These books all have rich scientific content and are written through literary forms, and are also lively pamphlets that Gorky called "disseminating scientific knowledge with artistic means." This type of book will be even more learning reference materials for science courses in schools. Its importance cannot be ignored.

　　When we introduce these books to students, we must take into account the students' reading time and reading ability, guide their reading methods in a planned way, formulate various outlines, use group discussions to arouse their interest and courage in reading, let them take reading notes, write diaries, constantly supervise and investigate their reading notes or diaries, pay attention to their reading experience and the degree of understanding, and give appropriate encouragement or correction. On the other hand, when introducing each book, we must tell them the main purpose of each book, the author or translator, the place of publication, and the price of the book in detail, take care of their economic ability, encourage them to save money and buy if they can, otherwise go to the school library to borrow, or go directly to the major bookstores in the city (Sanlian, Xinhua, Dazhong, Lianying, etc.) to read on their own.

　　In short, in order to educate the new generation of new China, it is an important practical task for all teachers to effectively conduct practical ideological education for students through guiding extracurricular reading in order to enrich their knowledge.

### 从讲课到指导课外阅读

　　从讲课到指导课外阅读
    刘齐瓛
    一向沿用注入式的“寻章摘句”的讲授方法，对于今天的教学——尤其是国文教学，我最初感到太陌生和窘迫。
    暑假后，我开始教初中国文（新华书店出版）就碰到许多困难。最初，在讲课的时候，我非常细心地，认真地给同学们分析和解释着课文的内容。讲完后，同学们没有什么反映，自己也认为很圆满，很成功。
    两星期后，他们忽然向我提出正面的意见，他们说：“课文内容简单浅易，不讲也能够了解。”“一学期讲课不过十几篇，质量都少，对于学习，没有多少收获。”“没有指定课外阅读范围，不知阅读何书。”……就在开国文小组会的时候，别班的同学也不断提出类似的意见。他们学习国文的态度，是够认真的，求知心是非常迫切的。怎样才能不辜负他们这种学习精神和满足他们的需要呢？这问题，在我脑里不知盘旋了多少时候。
    关于课文的内容，有些篇的确很简单浅易，难怪他们感到不满足；同时，我的讲课方法也确实太陈腐呆板了，那怎么会引起他们学习的兴趣呢？至于课文的质量与课外阅读问题，也深深感到分配与指导的不够。我反复研索这些问题，一面环绕课文尽量搜找与课文有联系的一些具体的生动活泼的材料；一面计划着一种生动活泼的教学方式。
    于是，再上课时，除了把课文内容予以清晰的阐述外，特别着重正确地介绍作者或课文内容的中心人物底传记及课外参考材料。譬如在讲“接待贵客”一篇叙述毛主席热诚接待农民的故事时，便连带讲述毛主席的生平：他是怎样学习的和怎样勇敢革命的事迹，同时介绍给他们看几种毛主席底传记书籍，如：“毛泽东青少年时代”（肖三编）“毛泽东自传”（史诺著）“毛泽东同志略传”（肖三编）之类，让他们课外去阅读。同样在讲“列宁和炉匠”一篇列宁对待炉匠宽宏大量的故事时，便连带讲述列宁革命的重要事实及其童年的生活与学习，另外也介绍有关列宁的书籍，如：“列宁的童年”（月列琴尼科夫著，金人译）“列宁的故事”（左琴科著，曹靖华译）“列宁书传”（路斯·肖编，凌山译）“列宁传”（雅洛斯拉夫斯基著，莫文译）之类。又如在讲“红军中的小鬼们”时，这课文后面的习题里曾指出搜集人民革命战争中的儿童英勇事迹，这便可介绍他们阅读“红军长征故事”（高朗亭等编）“一个女人翻身的故事”（孔厥著）“小号手”（罗丹著）等一类的书。至于在不论介绍每一种书的时候，都必须扼要的抽出每一种书内容的精采断片，象放映电影介绍精采境头一样，引起他们高度的阅读情绪，发动他们课外去阅读。
    我这样进行了三课书，再去问同学，他们都感到比以前满意了。他们说：“课文内容丰富了，质量提高了，课文之外，能读许多好文章。”他们对学习国文的兴趣普遍的提高了。于是在图书馆里看到他们抢着借书的现象，也有自己花钱去买的。下课的时候，常常听到他们嚷嚷着“列宁传”，“毛泽东青少年时代”……的声音，作文时也看到他们有材料可写了。一个小同学在“一封信”里曾这样的反映着“我在小学时，对国语并不发生兴趣，就是入中学以后，在刚开学时，对国文还不感到什么兴趣。近来国文教师对课外进行了一些补充及讲些有意义的书籍的故事，所以我近来对国文发生了浓厚的兴趣。”他们是这样认真的学习着，他们再不感到“课文简单”“质量少”或“无书可读”的枯燥了。
    从上面的试验，我获得一个新的启示：就是从讲课而介绍传记等课外书，引申到广泛的指导他们课外阅读问题——这是有关于培养他们的正确思想与灌输他们新鲜知识的重要问题；尤其培养他们正确思想，一个伟大传记的介绍，便直接是一个思想教育。“苏联学生的思想政治教育”一书里，斯米尔诺夫在一篇“文学阅读教学上的思想政治教育”的报告里，就曾着重的指出：“在文学阅读课程中包括的传记首先是有思想教育课题的传记，……他们有伟大的教育影响，虽然文学阅读的课程里只有简短的一篇，他的传记，却有巨大的教育意义。这是我们时代的一位英雄，这是我们学生底品性模范；他是这样的一个人，他以他底无量的精力和对人民事业与革命事业的无限忠诚引起了重大的惊异，将他的传记用到学校里面来是太好了——这是一件伟大的教育工作。”传记在苏联的文学阅读课里，就这样的被重视着，我们不仅利用这种活泼的讲课方法，另外将更得到一件进行思想教育的法宝。
    其次，广泛的指导课外阅读，当然是很要紧的一件事。在才进中学年纪不过十几岁的小学生，他们还是儿童，他们非常需要阅读新鲜的儿童读物，在目前出版的若干儿童文库里，应予多量的选择与介绍，这对于他们是有极大意义的。鲁迅先生说：“为了新的孩子们，是一定要给他们新作品，使他面向着变化不停的新世界，不断的发荣滋长的。”（表的序言里）这是很明确的一个指示。
    至于我们既广泛的指导课外阅读，在新的书籍里，我们不要仅让他们拘限于阅读象前面所列举的文学书籍，同时我们必须有计划的指导他们多阅读科学书，因为文学书和科学书是分不开的，高尔基说“文艺书和通俗科学书之间不应有划然的界线。”鲁迅在给一个向他请益的青年颜黎民的信里更具体的说明着“专看文学书，也不好的。先前的文学青年，往往厌恶数学、理化、史地、生物学，以为这些都无足轻重，后来变成连常识也没有，研究文学固然不明白，自己做起文章来也糊涂。所以我希望你们不要放开科学，一味钻在文学里。”这又是多么明确的一个指示。
    现在我们根据适合于学生阅读的科学读物，可以用分类法选出若干种：譬如
    阅读有关经济的便可选出：
    “少年经济学讲话”（崔尚辛著，开明书店出版）
    “五年计划故事”（伊林著，董纯才译，开明书店出版）……等书。
    阅读有关历史的便可选出：
    “近代世界革命史话”（陈光祖编，东北书店出版）
    “中国史话”（许立群著，东北书店出版）
    “中国抗战史讲话”（朱泽甫著，光华书店出版）
    “中国近代史讲话”（韩启农著，光华书店出版）等书。
    阅读有关地理的便可选出：
    “航海的故事”（刘虎如著，开明书店出版）
    “人和山”（伊林著，董纯才译，开明书店出版）
    “世界大都市”（胡仲持著，新中国书店出版）
    “西北”“黄水”（蔡君启著，光华书店出版）等书。
    阅读有关理化的便可选出：
    “物理世界的漫游”（德盖尔著，顾均正译，开明出版）
    “水”（陈大年著，东北书店出版）等书。
    阅读有关生物的便可选出：
    “生物奇谈”（法，法布尔著，宋易译，光华书店出版）
    “动物珍话”（英、富克斯著，齐荷文译，光华书店出版）
    “狗的故事”（托尔斯泰著，陈原译，光华书店出版）
    “凤蝶外传”（董纯才著，东北书店出版）
    “田野里的杂草”（周建人著，新中国书店出版）
    阅读有关生理卫生的便可选出：
    “人和病”（彭昭庆著，新华书店出版）
    “细菌与人”（高士其著，开明书店出版）
    阅读有关工程的便可选出：
    “一个苏联飞机构造家的自述”（雅可福烈夫著，新华书店出版）
    “汽车怎样跑路”（伊林著，符其珣等译，开明书店出版）等书。
    阅读有关自然科学一般的方面便可选出：
    “人民科学丛书”（凡十二种，天下图书公司出版）
    “十万个为什么”“黑白”（“黑白”又名“书的故事”，此书以胡愈之译本最好，生活书店出版。）“不夜天”（灯的故事）“几点钟”（四书皆伊林著，董纯才译，开明书店出版）
    “科学与日常生活”（英、海登著，陈原译，生活书店版）等书。这些书都是有着丰富的科学内容并通过文学形式写出的，也正象高尔基所说的“以艺术手腕传布科学知识”的生动的小册子。这一类书将更是学校里科学课程的学习参考资料。其重要性是不容漠视的。
    我们在介绍同学这些书的时候，必须照顾同学阅读时间和阅读的能力，有计划的指导他们阅读方法，拟出各项提纲，利用小组讨论的方式鼓起他们阅读的兴趣和勇气，让他们作读书笔记，写日记，经常的督促和调查他们的读书笔记或日记，注意他们阅读的心得和了解的程度，予以适当的鼓励或纠正。另一方面在介绍每一种书的时候，必须把每一个种书的内容主旨、著者或译者、出版地方、书的价钱详细的告诉他们，照顾他们的经济能力，能够储钱的发动他们购买，否则到学校图书馆里去借，或直接到本市各大书店（三联、新华、大众、联营等）里去，自行阅读。
    总之，为了教育新中国的新一代，从指导课外阅读上，使学生有效的受到实际的思想教育，以丰富其知识，这在全体教师们不能不算是一个重要的实际任务。
