(Beijing News) Since the autumn property tax collection began in Beijing, citizens have been enthusiastically paying their taxes. However, some people still do not understand the nature of the property tax and have raised some questions. Our reporter interviewed Zhao Zishang, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, on these issues, and received the following answers:

Question: If the rent collected is low, can the tax amount be reduced or exempted?

Answer: Property tax is a property tax, not a rental income tax. Therefore, the property tax amount is not proportional to the rent level, and low rent is not a reason for reduction or exemption. Whether the rent should be increased is another matter.

Question: Is it right for landlords to force tenants to bear the additional hygiene and education fees?

Answer: No. Property tax is a property tax, and the landlord is the taxpayer. Therefore, the hygiene and education fees attached to the property tax cannot be forcibly paid by the tenant (unless there is a separate contractual agreement). The government issues payment notices with the door number of the property location as the target, so tenants have the obligation to forward or pay on behalf of the landlord (withholding the payment from the rent). If the property rights are unclear or undetermined, the landlord does not reside in the city or has fled, or there are no property rights and public property is temporarily occupied without compensation, the property tax shall be temporarily paid by the current user.

Question: How to resolve disputes over the right to the initial investment in a business property?

Answer: Before new regulations are announced, those with the right to the initial investment in a business property will temporarily pay taxes according to past customary practices.

Question: How to pay taxes when property rights are in litigation and the transfer of old and new owners has not been completed?

Answer: If the property rights of a certain house are in litigation, the property tax shall be temporarily paid by the person listed on the notice. In case of disputes arising from the transfer of property rights without completing the ownership transfer, the provisions of the Finance Bureau's Finance and Administration Document No. 176 of November 22 shall apply: If the purchase and sale agreement was signed before the commencement of deed tax collection on August 15 of this year, the new owner shall be responsible for the payment; if the purchase and sale agreement was signed after August 15, the old owner shall be responsible for the completion of the payment. However, if both parties have an agreement, their agreement shall prevail.

Question: During this property tax collection, some citizens found errors in the payment notices. How to solve this?

Answer: The Finance Bureau has reviewed its careless work in this area. If there are errors in the tax amount calculation, writing errors, or inconsistencies in the number of rooms or types of property in the payment notices, citizens can go to the district office where they are located to check and correct them. However, if the use of the property has changed and was not reported during the summer, it will not be corrected this time.

Question: Are there any households that have been missed in this property tax collection? How to deal with it?

Answer: All houses that have not been approved for property tax exemption by the government, regardless of whether the property rights belong to the public or private sector, and regardless of their use, must pay taxes. Those who have concealed their property and failed to report it, or those who have not received a notice from the government, should voluntarily report to the Finance Bureau, pay taxes, and fulfill their obligations.

　　京市财政局长赵子尚解答秋季房产税问题
    【北京讯】北京市秋季房产税开征以来，市民缴款十分踊跃。但也还有少数人不明白房产税的性质，提出了一些问题。记者顷就这些问题访问市政府财政局赵长尚局长，承答复如下：
    问：房租收得少，是否可以减免税额。
    答：房产税是一种财产税，并非租赁所得税，因此，房产税额与房租高低无比例关系，收租少不能成为减免理由。至于房租应否提高，那是另一问题。
    问：房主强令房客担负附征之卫生教育费，对不对？
    答：不对。房产税即是财产税，房主是纳税义务人，故房产税附征之卫生教育费，不能强令房客代纳（另有合同协议者除外）。政府开列缴款通知书是以房产所在地门牌号数为对象，故房客有代转或代缴的义务（代缴者由租金内扣除）。如有产权不明或产权未定，房主不在本市居住或房主逃亡，以及根本无产权和无偿暂住公产者，暂由现时使用人缴纳房产税。
    问：关于铺底权之争执，如何解决？
    答：设有铺底权者，在新规定未公布前，暂依过去习惯法缴税。
    问：产权涉讼未决及新旧业主转移未曾过户，如何纳税？
    答：如某房产权涉讼未决，暂由通知书所列人缴纳房产税。因产业转移未曾过户而起争执者，则依财政局十一月二十二日财行字第一七六号通告之规定：如在本年八月十五日契税开征以前买卖立约者，由新业主担负缴纳；如在八月十五日以后买卖立约者，则由旧业主担负完纳。但双方已有协议者，从其约定。
    问：此次征收房产税，曾有部分市民发现缴款通知书内有错误，如何解决？
    答：财政局对这方面工作的粗枝大叶作风已作检讨，凡缴款通知书内有税额算错，写错，或与间数不符，种类不符者，市民可到所在区公所查核纠正。但如其用途变动，而因夏季未申报者，此次暂不改正。
    问：此次房产税之征收，是否还有漏户？如何处理？
    答：凡未经政府核免房产税之房屋，无论产权属公属私，无论作何用途，均得纳税。其因自己隐匿未报，或政府未送达通知书者，均应自动向财政局报告，要纳税，履行自己的义务。
