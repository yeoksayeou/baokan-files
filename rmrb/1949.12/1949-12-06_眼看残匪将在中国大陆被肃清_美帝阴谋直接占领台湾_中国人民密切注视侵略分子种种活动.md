Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th: The Chinese people are closely watching the conspiracy of American imperialism to directly occupy Taiwan Province, Chinese territory. As the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits are about to be completely eliminated on the Chinese mainland, the activities of American aggressors attempting to annex Taiwan and turn it into a Pacific strategic base under direct American control have become increasingly blatant and active. According to a French News Agency (AFP) report on December 2nd, American imperialism instigated its puppet, the chairman of the "Taiwan Independence League" in Japan, to submit a "petition" to war-monger MacArthur on December 2nd, begging MacArthur to "immediately occupy Taiwan and place Taiwan under his direct control." At the same time, Under Secretary of the Army Voorhees, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans Gruenther, and Chief of Personnel Administration of the Army Brooks, have departed from the United States for Japan. According to an AFP report on December 2nd, Tokyo sources believe that the main goal of Voorhees' trip is to discuss the Taiwan issue with MacArthur and to study the issue of extending the occupation rights of Japan to Taiwan. These people believe that Gruenther's arrival in Japan indicates the necessity of occupying Taiwan for "strategic" reasons, while Brooks' arrival in Japan means that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff are consulting MacArthur on the additional troop strength needed to occupy Taiwan. Another AFP report stated that American military circles in Tokyo are also strongly advocating the extension of Japanese occupation rights to Taiwan. The report also revealed that American imperialism instigated the "Taiwan Independence League" to issue the aforementioned "petition," which was also welcomed by Japanese "leaders."

American imperialism's recent ambition to invade Taiwan is also manifested in the influx of American aggressors to Taiwan. Republican Senator and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee Ferguson flew from Tokyo to Taipei on December 2nd, and said at a press conference on the same day: "Taiwan is an important place in the world. The Cold War is now going on all over the world, and Taiwan is also part of the Cold War area." Prior to this, notorious anti-communist Senator Nolan flew to Taiwan on November 19th to carry out activities, and left Taiwan for Manila on the 22nd. Nolan openly declared at a press conference that the United States "has a responsibility" for the Taiwan issue. Nathan, the executor of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's "Aid to China" program, "inspected" Taiwan for more than ten days, and accompanied Ferguson in his activities.

The reason for American imperialism's invasion of Taiwan was most blatantly stated by The New York Times. According to a United Press report on November 16th, The New York Times commented: "It is questionable whether the Kuomintang can hold Taiwan with its existing resources." It also stated: "The military position of Taiwan is of the most urgent concern to the United States." The New York Times even included Taiwan in the "defensive strategic line" of the United States in the Pacific, saying that the liberation of Taiwan would "further weaken our (referring to American imperialism) entire position in East Asia and its outposts."

　　眼看残匪将在中国大陆被肃清
  　美帝阴谋直接占领台湾
    中国人民密切注视侵略分子种种活动
    【新华社北京五日电】中国人民正密切地注视着美国帝国主义企图直接占领中国领土台湾省的阴谋。随着国民党残匪即将在中国大陆上被全部肃清，美国侵略分子妄图吞并台湾，变台湾为美国直接控制下的太平洋战略基地的活动，便愈益露骨和积极。据法新社二日消息，美国帝国主义嗾使其傀儡旅日“台湾独立同盟”主席，于本月二日向麦克阿瑟递送“请愿书”，乞求战争贩子麦克阿瑟“立即占领台湾并将台湾置于其直接管制之下”。与此同时，美国陆军部次长伍利斯偕作战计划副参谋长格鲁特、陆军部人事行政处处长布鲁克斯等已由美国动身赴日。据法新社二日电称：东京人士认为伍利斯此行主要目标是与麦克阿瑟讨论台湾问题，并研讨把日境占领权扩大到台湾的问题。这些人士认为：格鲁特的抵日指明为了“战略”理由占领台湾的必要性，而布鲁克斯的抵日则意味着美国参谋本部正在征询麦克阿瑟对占领台湾所需的补充部队兵力的意见。法新社另电报道称，东京美国军界人士也在力主持日本占领权扩大到台湾。该电并透露，美国帝国主义为此唆使“台湾独立同盟”发表上述“请愿书”，这个“请愿书”还得到日本“领导人物”的欢迎。
    美国帝国主义最近对台湾侵略的野心还表现在美国侵略分子的纷纷前往台湾。美共和党参议员兼参院拨款委员会委员福开森二日由东京飞抵台北，并在当日的记者招待会中说：“台湾是世界中的一个重要地方。冷战现在正在全世界进行着，台湾也是冷战地区中的一部分”。在此以前，臭名昭著的美反对参议员诺兰于十一月十九日飞台湾活动，二十二日始离台飞马尼拉。诺兰竟在记者招待会中公然宣称，美国对台湾问题“负有责任”。美国“经合署”“援华”方案的执行人纳森则在台湾到处“视察”达十余天之久，并曾陪同福开森进行活动。
    美国帝国主义侵略台湾的原因，以纽约时报说得最为露骨。据合众社十一月十六日电报道纽约时报的评论称：“国民党是否能以现有的资源守住台湾是成问题的。”又称：“台湾的军事地位是美国最为迫切关心的。”纽约时报竟将台湾包括到美国在太平洋的“防御战略线”中，说什么台湾的解放将“进一步削弱我们（按指美国帝国主义）在东亚大陆及前哨的整个地位”。
