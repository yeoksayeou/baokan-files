　　How Soviet Collective Farms Solve Public and Private Interests
　　Written by Professor I. D. Lepotov, translated by A Hui
　　Stalin said at a conference of collective farm shock workers in 1934: "...We cannot divorce ourselves from reality. We should understand that the collective labor of collective farms is to meet public needs, and on the other hand, collective farm peasants also need a small piece of land to meet private needs. If we recognize personal needs and personal interests, then these issues should also be taken care of. Otherwise, the collective farm cannot be strengthened. The secret to consolidating the collective farm lies in coordinating the public and private interests of the collective farm."
　　In the Soviet Union, millions of small-scale production farmers have been transformed into large-scale socialist farms, which is a historical first.
　　For hundreds of years, the relations of production were based on the private ownership of the means of production, resulting in the exploitation of man by man. The greatest revolution in history is the socialist relations of production, where the means of production become public property. Therefore, the toiling peasant masses can be free from exploitation, and the collective farm—the most advanced and effective form of agricultural collective labor—is established.
　　The basic principle of the collective farm is socialist public ownership. The entire Soviet society is built on this principle.
　　All the main means of production of the collective farm are publicly owned: draught animals and tools (plows, seeders, threshers, etc.), seeds, livestock feed, public buildings, and all agricultural product operations, etc.
　　All the products of the collective farm are public property.
　　People outside the Soviet Union often think that once they join a collective farm, individuals have no private property. While the main means of production are indeed socialist public property, it is also believed that personal daily necessities such as bowls, dishes, and cloth are also communized. This idea is wrong and undoubtedly influenced by malicious rumors about collective farms and the lives of Soviet people.
　　In fact, each farm household in a collective farm can still own a small garden plot for personal use and own all side occupations on this garden plot, as well as housing, livestock for consumption, poultry, and small farm implements as their personal property.
　　Collective farm peasants, like other citizens of the Soviet Union, are not restricted in their ownership of personal items (such as clothing, furniture, etc.). No one can interfere with this kind of ownership. Personal items can be sold, pawned, given as gifts, or passed on to descendants as inheritance.
　　Personal property rights are protected by state law. Article 10 of the Soviet Constitution: "The right of citizens to personal ownership of their labor income and savings, houses and household subsidiary industries, household utensils and articles of personal consumption and convenience, as well as the right of citizens to inherit personal property, is protected by law."
　　(I)
　　At the present time, the main form of collective farm is agricultural collective labor. This form can both complete socialist construction and meet the needs and interests of individual peasants. The main reason is the socialist public ownership of the means of production and production materials and the socialization of labor organization and wages. At the same time, the right to side-occupation production to meet the private needs of collective farm peasants is also retained.
　　Collective farms are based on the socialist property system and contain many developmental conditions.
　　In many areas temporarily occupied by the German army during the Patriotic War, the losses suffered by collective farms alone amounted to 181,000,000,000 rubles. Active reclamation is currently underway. The socialist system of agriculture can not only carry out reclamation smoothly, but also greatly exceed the pre-war area of cultivation within five years. Many foreign observers have discovered the benefits of collective farms. J.B. Priestley, a British writer who lived in the Soviet Union in 1945, visited many collective farms. He said that after visiting the collective farms and contacting many people, he believed that this system was really good. People outside the Soviet Union cannot imagine how people in collective farms can enjoy private life. "Really," he added, "the success of collective farms has surprised me more than once."
　　What is the significance of the combination of the public interests of the collective farm and the private interests of the members?
　　The first significance is the development and increase of the collective farm's public property. The small piece of land owned by the members only plays a supplementary role, only giving people an opportunity to meet their personal needs. In fact, with the increasing increase in labor production, the public economy will be able to better meet his needs. This is certain. Before the war, the land sown on collective farms was approximately 118,000,000 hectares, while the land cultivated privately was only 4,500,000 hectares. The high degree of mechanization of collective farm work guarantees the improvement of production harvests. Before the October Revolution, a poor or middle peasant family could only produce 140 poods of grain (including the land rent they paid to landlords and rich peasants); while before the Patriotic War, an average family on a collective farm could produce 360 poods of grain. 　
　　Collective farms have public pastures. Before collectivization, a quarter of the households had no livestock, and they only had livestock after joining the collective farm. Now there are no "cattle-free households" in the collective farms.
　　The main income of the members comes from socialist public property. For example, in 1945, 78 percent of the total income of the members of the Remanski collective farm in the Moscow region was distributed from public property, and only 22 percent was from their private land.
　　This means that the members of the collective farm rely on public property, not private economy, to become wealthy.
　　Further, the significance of coordinating public and private interests is to strengthen the organizational awareness of uniting peasants, so that they are responsible in their work and abide by comrades' discipline. The role of collective labor is like a school, specializing in educating people with a new, conscious, socialist labor discipline, a socialist attitude towards labor and public property, and training collective farm members with Soviet patriotic spirit. The peasants have gained new political and material benefits from the collective farm, and in the Patriotic War, they amazingly expressed their loyalty to the public interest.
　　In order to defend the exploitation of the majority by the minority, bourgeois thinkers constantly insist that private needs can only be met based on private property. Some of us also have a similar prejudice, which is the argument of "consolidating small farms." Marxists have long proved—and life itself is proving this fact every day—that this so-called "consolidation of small farms" is not as good as any consolidation.
　　The collective farm system proves that the public and socialist property of the farm can relieve poverty in the countryside and increase the property of farm households. The wealth of individual farm households must be based on the increase of the public property of the collective farm. Socialism enables every working man or woman to have the opportunity to fully develop their personal talents and meet their personal needs according to the amount of public labor they do.
　　The needs of individual members, correctly speaking, should be consistent with the public interests of the collective farm. However, the development of public and private interests on the collective farm cannot proceed smoothly. Because this development includes the conflict between the new and the old. Progressive men and women honestly and diligently work on the collective farm, selflessly increasing public property—the foundation of their private property. However, the old concept of private ownership still exists. The struggle against this concept is constantly being carried out, and at the same time, efforts are being made to establish socialist labor discipline. New and progressive things are irresistible; its growth, continuous growth, will eventually triumph. This is the principle of social development. But it would be wrong to assume that new and progressive things will triumph without outside help. No, its success depends on the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government.
　　(II)
　　Collective farms need the continuous leadership of the Party and the government, because this large-scale socialist economy is a planned economy.
　　The public ownership of the means of production of collective farms should be a planned economic behavior and cannot be developed without a plan. Without an economic budget, the collective farm must fail. When predicting the production of the collective farm, it is necessary to combine the interests of the members with the interests of the farm, and with the interests of the entire country. The rules of agricultural cooperatives indicate that collective farms absolutely accept national plans. The primary task of each collective farm is to fulfill its obligations to the state.
　　This is different from large-scale capitalist plans, the result of which is often the bankruptcy and impoverishment of the vast majority of peasants. Such farms do not conform to a planned economy. On the contrary, large-scale socialist attempts can only work under the leadership of a planned economy, and do not allow unrestrained and automatic development. Because such development is harmful to this kind of farm.
　　That is why Stalin said that the Party must lead the collective farms, be responsible for the work of the collective farms, and help the farmers develop their enterprises by relying on advanced science and technology.
　　It is a very important principle that the private interests of the members must be combined with the public and national interests. The members play a great role in supporting the economic and military strength of the entire country. It is the sacred responsibility of each member to quickly and honestly implement their obligations to the state.
　　If all the methods that can increase public socialist property are fully utilized, and everything that does not conform to socialist property, and does not conform to the principles of new production methods is eliminated. Then, the collective farm can be very successfully developed.
　　The Soviet government's regulations on the management of labor unions in the collective farm department are strictly enforced to solve the problem of establishing collective farms. The establishment of this collective farm department is of great significance to the development of collective farms.
　　(III)
　　The main driving force for the development of collective farms is the principle of paying wages according to labor. Because this makes the members willing to work hard to increase production, which greatly promotes the development of the farm. Wages are calculated based on the number of work-day units.
　　What is a work-day unit? A work-day unit in a collective farm is a measurement of the quality and quantity of work done by a member for the public in one working day.
　　The work-day unit came with the development of agricultural cooperatives. Initially, the income of collective farms was often divided equally, often according to the number of consumers and other similar situations. The work-day unit abolished the average remuneration for the labor of the members. The calculation of work-days has seven levels (the prescribed standards have been reached), the lowest being simple work that does not require special skills (calculated as half a work-day), and the highest being work that requires extremely skilled skills (two work-day units).
　　The work-day unit standardizes many different jobs on the collective farm, reflecting the socialist principle; that is, everyone must work and be rewarded according to the quality and quantity of their labor.
　　The work-day unit is the standard for calculating the labor of the members. Because the regulations of this work-day unit are discussed by many members in meetings, and also take into account the individual circumstances of each farm. But in terms of the relationship between money and goods (whether inside or outside the collective farm), it is not enough to evaluate labor with the work-day unit alone. Labor creates products, and the value of the product determines the value of labor, so money is only a measure of the size of the labor force consumed.
　　Work-day units can also measure consumption. The articles of association of agricultural cooperatives stipulate that the income of collective farms is distributed according to the quality and quantity of their labor. Therefore, skilled farmers receive more remuneration than simple laborers.
　　The work-day unit is the most important item in the collective farm system. Its meaning is broad. Each department of the collective farm can calculate the distribution of labor force according to work-day units. The annual report of the collective farm explains how the work of the farm is distributed. Labor productivity and the work of the entire collective farm also depend on the correct use of labor force. Extra work gets extra remuneration, which can stimulate the members to increase production, increase the private income of the members, and increase the output of agricultural products such as livestock.
　　Therefore, the work-day unit is an expression of the coordination of the private interests of the members and the public interests of the collective farm.
　　Most of the members are working responsibly and honestly. Over the years, the number of people with only a few work-day units has gradually decreased, and the number of people with many work-day units has increased. The average work-day unit for an adult was 252 in 1940, and increased to 351 in 1944. This number clearly shows the attitude of the vast members towards socialist labor.
　　(IV)
　　Now let's talk about the land issue of collective farms.
　　The land of the collective farm is the property of the state; it belongs to all the people. Article 8 of the Soviet Constitution stipulates that "All land used by collective farms is used by the collective farm free of charge and indefinitely, that is, forever. The third paragraph of the Agricultural Cooperative Articles of Association stipulates that the land of the collective farm shall not be reduced under any circumstances. The articles of association also stipulate that the small plots of land used privately shall be determined according to the individual circumstances of each farm.
　　The land issue that farmers are most concerned about has been resolved in the Soviet Union, that is, the land has been nationalized and many large-scale socialist cultivation projects have been organized.
　　The state ownership of land and the socialist production of collective farms are completely in line. The development of both does not prevent the land from being used for production and increasing its fertility.
　　Relying on machines and tractor stations, collective farms have become the driving force for the progress of agricultural technology, which is not restricted by the private ownership of the means of production, including the private ownership of land.
　　Only in collective farms is it possible to unlimitedly utilize all progressive science. It is not without reason that Soviet agricultural chemistry has become the most advanced in the world in such a short period of time. This most advanced agricultural system is organized on vast lands, based on a planned approach and a national correct grain rotation system. The latest inventions in agricultural chemistry have been applied on a large scale. Huge irrigation systems are formed by the joint forces of several republics.
　　Such progress would never be possible with private land ownership. This is very clear. The United States is proud to think that it has already solved the land problem in the past. After the American Civil War, a Homestead Act (1862) was passed, allowing each person to buy land privately, not exceeding 160 acres. This created countless small landowners—or small farmers. But what was the result? The unlimited economic development has come to an end. More than 50 percent of farmers in the United States have become tenant farmers. They have lost their land, and the rent debt—the shackles of small farmers—has risen to hundreds of millions of dollars today. Farmers who economize on food and clothing in order to save money to buy a small piece of land eventually become debtors of large banks. The loan conditions are so harsh that small landlords eventually lose their land due to excessive debt.
　　John Steinbeck vividly described in his novel "The Grapes of Wrath" how farmers were bankrupted by the capitalist economy.
　　In the Soviet Union, collective farm peasants and other peasants own vast fertile land. As long as they are productive farmers, they can enjoy land use rights. In this way, farmers do not have to spend a lot of money they cannot afford to buy land, nor do they have to pay rent to rich peasants for nothing, like farmers in other countries. Before the revolution, poor and middle peasants in Russia occupied approximately 137,000,000 hectares, and they had to pay high taxes and various peasant burdens. Today, the fields of collective farms are no less than 488,000,000 hectares, which is 350,000,000 hectares more than the fields owned by rich and middle peasants before the revolution.
　　(V)
　　The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government have always protected public socialist property. The law of August 7, 1932, has declared this property sacred and inviolable. Anyone who wants to infringe on this land is an enemy of the collective farm and all the people.
　　Public socialist ownership has brought great material benefits to the members of the collective farm. Before the revolution, poor and middle peasants produced 2,500,000,000 poods of grain. Before this Patriotic War, the members of the collective farm produced 6,000,000,000 poods, that is, more than 3,500,000,000 poods.
　　The growth of collective farms is based on expanded reproduction and internal socialist accumulation. The government has provided great assistance. On the eve of the war, the inalienable property of the collective farm, the most important national financial economy, was composed of 21,000,000,000 rubles. More than 90 percent of this money was accumulated from the production of the collective farm itself. Therefore, only 10 percent of the property can be counted as the property of the former peasants.
　　The public wealth of collective farms is one of the main foundations of the economic strength of the socialist state, and it is also the source of personal happiness for every honest working member.
　　The collective farm is a voluntary association of working peasants. The highest administrative body of collective labor is the peasant conference, and many important issues of the farm are resolved by this conference. Stalin's labor union articles of association have given legal status to the democratic principle of collective farm management.
　　The members are the absolute masters of their economy. After they pay the taxes due to the state, they decide how to distribute the remaining materials and money according to the articles of association of the labor union. It is a crime forbidden by law if the property, products and cash of the collective farm are distributed without the approval of the general meeting of all members.
　　The Party and the government believe that any violation of the democratic principle of collective farm administration is a crime against the state.
　　In leading the development of collective farms, the Bolshevik Party and the government also rely on the democracy of collective farms and the creativity and constructive efforts of the leading people to further strengthen the democratic economy of collective farms and further improve the happiness of the members.

### 苏联的集体农庄怎样解决公私利益的

　　苏联的集体农庄怎样解决公私利益的
    Ｉ·Ｄ·莱泼托夫教授著  阿灰译
    斯大林在一九三四年在一个集体农庄突击工作者大会上说：“……我们不能脱离现实。我们应该明白集体劳动的集体农庄是来满足公共的需要的，而另一方面，集体农场的农民也要一小块地来满足私人的需要。如果我们承认个人的需要和个人的利益，那么这些问题也应该照顾到。否则集体农场就不可能坚固起来。巩固集体农场的秘诀就在配合集体农场公共的和私人和利益。”
    在苏联，已有数百万的小规模生产的农民转变到大规模的社会主义农场，那是历史上首创的。
    数百年来的生产关系是生产手段的私有制，以致造成了人的剥削人。历史上最大的革命就是社会主义的生产关系，生产手段变成公有。因之劳苦的农民大众可以从此不被剥削，而集体农庄——最前进、最有效的农业集体劳动——也就建立起来了。
    集体农庄的基本原则是社会主义公有制。苏联整个的社会就是建筑在这个原则上的。
    集体农庄的一切主要生产手段都是公有的：耕畜与工具（犁、播种机和打谷机等）、种籽，牲畜的饲料，公共建筑物，以及一切农产品的经营等。
    集体农庄的一切生产品都是公共财产。
    苏联之外的人往往以为一加入了集体农庄个人就没有一丝私有财产了。主要的生产工具固然是社会主义公有了，而个人的日常用具如碗、碟、布等也要共产。这种观念是错误的，无疑是受了对于集体农庄和苏维埃人民生活的恶意造谣的影响。
    事实上，集体农庄内每一农户还能拥有小块园地供个人使用，并且拥有此园地上所有副业，以及住宅、食用牲畜、家禽及细小农具为其个人财产。
    集体农庄的农人也和苏联其他的公民一样，在个人的用品（如衣服、家具等）所有权上绝不受限制。这种所有权是没有人可以干涉的。个人的用品可以出卖、当押、当礼物送人或当遗产传给子孙。
    个人财产权是国家法律所保护的。苏联宪法第十条：“公民对其劳动收入及储蓄、住宅及家庭副业、家常用具及必需品，自己消费及舒适品之个人所有权，以及公民个人财产之继承权，均受法律之保护。”
　　（一）
    目前时期，集体农庄的主要方式是农业集体劳动。这个方式，一方面能够完成社会主义的建设，另一方面也能够满足个体农民的需要和利益。其主要的原因是社会主义生产工具与生产资料公有制和劳工组织及工资的社会主义化。而同时，为满足集体农民私人需要的副业生产权也被保留着。
    集体农庄基于社会主义财产制，含有许多发展性的条件。
    在爱国战争中被德军暂时占领的许多地区，仅就集体农庄一项来说，所受的损失达一八一、○○○、○○○、○○○卢布。目前正在积极的重垦。社会主义制度的农业不但在重垦上能顺利地进行，而且在五年之内其垦植的土地可以大大的超出战前的面积。许多外国观察家都发现了集体农庄的好处。一九四五年在苏联居住的英国作家Ｊ·Ｂ·泼利斯脱来曾经访问过不少集体农庄，他说，他访问了集体农庄和接触了不少人之后，认为这种制度实在是好。苏联之外的人想象不出集体农庄的人如何能享受私人生活。“真的，”他加上说，“集体农庄的成功使我惊奇不止呢。”
    集体农庄公共的利益和庄员私人的利益底配合究竟有什么意义呢？
    第一个意义就是集体农庄公共财产的发展和增加。庄员所有的一小块土地仅是辅助作用的，只是给人一个可以满足个人的需要的机会。其实劳动生产日益增加，公共的经济就能够更好的满足他的需要。这是一定的。在战前集体农庄播种的地大约有一一八、○○○、○○○公顷，而私人垦种的地仅四、五○○、○○○公顷。集体农庄的工作高度的机械化，保障了生产收获的提高。十月革命之前，一家贫农或中农仅能生产一百四十普特粮食（包括他们付给地主和富农的租地粮）；而在爱国战争之前，集体农庄上平均每家可以生产三百六十普特的粮食。 　集体农庄上有公共的牧场。在没有集体化之前，四分之一的人家是没有牲口的，当他们加入了集体农庄之后才有了牲口。现在集体农庄已经没有“无牛之家”了。
    庄员们主要的收入都是从社会主义的公共财产里得来的。例如莫斯科区雷曼司基的集体农庄的庄员在一九四五年的总收入中，百分之七十八是从公共财产里分得的，而只有百分之二十二才是他们从私人种地得来的。
    这就是说，集体农庄的庄员是依靠公共财产，而不是依靠私人经济致富的。
    进一步说，配合公共和私人的利益的意义就是加强团结农民的组织意识，使他们在工作上负责任并遵守同志的纪律。集体劳动的作用好象是一个学校，专门教育人们以一种新的、自觉的、社会主义的劳动纪律，一种对于劳动和公共财产的社会主义态度，并且以苏维埃的爱国精神来训练集体农庄的庄员。农民们由于集体农庄而得到了新的政治上和物质上的利益，在爱国战争中他们惊人的表示了他们对公共利益的忠诚。
    资产阶级的思想家为了卫护少数人去剥削多数人，不时的坚持说私人的需要只有根基于私有财产才能满足。我们中间某些人也有这样一种异曲同工的成见，就是“巩固小型农场”这一论调。马克思主义者们老早证明了——生活本身也每天在说明这一事实——这种所谓的“小型农场的巩固”还不如任何的不巩固。
    集体农庄的制度证明了农庄的公共和社会主义的财产能够解除乡间的贫乏和增加农户的财产。个体农户的富有必需是建基于集体农庄的公共财产的增加。社会主义使每个劳动的男人或女人都有机会充分的发展个人才干的机会，依他们所做公共劳动的多少而满足个人的需要。
    个体庄员的需要，正确的说来，应该是和集体农庄的公共利益一致的。然而在集体农庄上公共利益和私人利益的发展还是不能顺利的进行。因为这个发展里面包括有新和旧的冲突。进步的男女诚实而努力的在集体农庄上工作，毫不自私的增进着公共财产——他们私有财产的基础。但是旧的私有制度的观念还存在着。对于这个观念一直在不断的进行着斗争，同时又竭力树立社会主义的劳动纪律。新的和进步的东西是不可克制的；它的生长，不断的成长，终必胜利。这是社会发展的原则。但是假如我们以为新的和进步的东西会不靠外来的帮助而获得胜利，那是错误的。不，它的成功有赖于布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府的领导。
　　（二）
    集体农庄需要党和政府底不断的领导，因为这个大规模的社会主义经济正是一个有计划的经济。
    集体农庄的生产手段公有，应该是有计划的经济行为而不能无计划的发展。没有经济预算集体农庄一定要失败的。在预计集体农庄的生产时，必需把庄员的利益和农庄利益，并且和整个国家的利益相配合。农业组合的规则上指明了集体农庄绝对接受国家的计划。每个集体农庄最先的任务，就是执行其对国家的义务。
    这和大规模的资本主义计划不同，那种无限制的发展结果往往使广大农民破产和陷于贫穷。那样的农庄不符合于有计划的经济。大规模的社会主义企图，相反的，只能在有计划的经济底领导下进行工作，不容许有不受束缚和自动的发展。因为那样的发展对于这种农庄是有害的。
    那就是为什么斯大林说党必定要领导集体农庄，对集体农庄的工作负责，帮助农人依靠进步的科学和技术而发展他们的企业。
    庄员私自的利益必需和公共的国家的利益相配合，那是很主要的一个原则。庄员对于整个国家的经济和军事力量底支持是起着极大的作用的。每个庄员的神圣的责任就是要迅速诚实的去实行他们对于国家的义务。
    如果把一切能使公共的社会主义财产增进的方法充分利用，把一切不符合社会主义财产的东西，不合乎新的生产方法原则的东西消灭。那么，集体农庄便可以很成功的发展了。
    苏联政府集体农庄部管理劳动组合的规程是被严格的执行着，解决建立集体农庄的问题。这个集体农庄部的设立对于集体农庄的发展有极大的意义。
　　（三）
    集体农庄的发展主要的动力就是按照劳动来付工资的一个原则。因为这样使庄员愿意努力增加生产，大大的推动了农庄的发展。工资的计算是以工作日单位的多少而定的。
    什么叫工作日单位？集体农场的工作日单位就是一个庄员在一个工作日为公众而做的工，在质和量两方面的测量。
    工作日单位是随着农业组合的发展而来的。最初，集体农庄的收入往往是均分的，往往是依照消费者的人数及其他类此的情形而分配的。工作日单位废除了庄员劳动的平均酬报。工作日的计算有七级（规定标准已达到），最低的是简单而无需特别技巧的工作（算半个工作日），最高的是极需技巧的工作（二个工作日单位）。
    工作日单位使集体农庄上许多不同的工作有一个标准，反映了社会主义的原则；就是每个人必需工作而且是依照他的劳动的质和量来取得酬报。
    工作日单位是计算庄员劳动的标准。因为这个工作日单位的规定是许多庄员集会讨论出来的，并且也注意到了各农庄个别的情况。但是在钱和货物的关系上（不论是集体农庄之内或之外），单拿工作日单位来估价劳动是不够的。劳动制造出产品，产品的价值决定劳动的价值，所以钱只是测量所耗的劳动力的尺寸。
    工作日单位也可以测量消费。农业组合的章程上规定集体农庄的收入是依照其劳动的质和量而分配的。因此，熟练的农民所得的酬报比简单的劳动者来得多了。
    工作日单位是集体农庄制度最要紧的一项。它的含意广大。集体农庄的各部门可以根据工作日单位而计算劳动力的分配。集体农庄每年的报告都说明了农庄的工作是怎样分配的。劳动生产和整个集体农庄的工作也依靠劳动力的正确运用。额外的工作得到额外的酬报，那样可以刺激庄员增进生产，提高庄员私人的收入，增加农产品如牲畜的产量。
    因此工作日单位就是庄员私人的利益和集体农庄公共利益配合的一种表现。
    大部分的庄员都很负责和诚实的工作着。几年以来，只有几个工作日单位的人渐渐少了，而有许多工作日单位的人愈来愈多了。一个成人的工作日单位在一九四○年平均是二百五十二，到一九四四年已增至三百五十一。这个数字很明显的表示出广大的庄员们对于社会主义劳动的态度。
　　（四）
    现在我们来谈集体农庄的土地问题。
    集体农庄的土地是国家的财产；是属于全体人民的。苏联宪法第八条规定“凡集体农庄所用之土地，归该集体农庄无代价与无期限使用，即永远使用。?睜农业组合章程上第三段规定了集体农庄的土地在任何情形下都不许减少。章程上并且规定了私人所用的小块土地得依各农庄的个别情形而定。
    农民们最关心的土地问题在苏联已获得了解决，就是把土地收归国有，并且组织许多大规模的社会主义垦植。
    土地的归国家所有和集体农庄的社会主义生产完全符合。两者的发展绝不妨碍土地的被用来生产和提高它的肥沃程度。
    靠了机器和拖拉机车站，集体农庄成了农业技巧进步的动力，这种进步是不受生产工具私有制的限制的，包括土地私有制的限制。
    只有在集体农庄才可能无限制的利用一切进步的科学。苏联的农业化学在这样短的时期内成了世界上最进步的，不是没有理由的。这个最进步的农业制度是在广大的土地上组织起来，基于有计划的方式和全国性的正确的谷物轮种制。农业化学上的最新的发明都大规模的被应用着。巨大的灌溉制度由几个共和国联合的力量组成。
    在土地私有时这样的进步是决不可能的。这一点很明显。美国很骄傲的以为自己已经在过去解决了土地问题。美国内战之后，通过了一个自耕农创定法（Ｈｏｍｅｓ ｔｅａｄ Ａｃｔ一八六二年），准许每个人买地私有，以不超过一百六十亩为限。于是就造成了无数小的土地所有者——或者小农民。但是结果怎样呢？无限制的经济发展到了尽头。美国百分之五十以上的农民都变成了佃农。他们已失掉土地，而且租地的债——小农民的枷锁——到今天已升至好几亿美金。节食忍饥为要积钱买一小块地的农民终于变了大银行的负债者。借债的条件苛刻到了终使小地主负债太多而失了土地。
    约翰·史坦培克在他的小说“愤怒的葡萄”里活泼地描写到农人怎样被资本经济所破产。
    在苏联，集体农庄的农民和其他的农民拥有广大肥沃的土地。只要是生产的农人都可以享受土地使用权。这样，农人不必化许多他们出不起的钱去买土地，也不白给富农纳租，象别的国家的农人一样。在革命之前，俄国的贫农和中农占地约一三七、○○○、○○○公顷，他们必需付很高的税和各色各样的农民负担。今天集体农庄的田已不止四八八、○○○、○○○公顷，比革命前富农和中农所有的田多了三五○、○○○、○○○公顷。
　　（五）
    布尔什维克党和苏联政府向来保护公共的社会主义的财产。一九三二年八月七日的法律已宣布这种财产为神圣不可侵犯。任何人想侵犯这块土地就是集体农庄和全体人民的敌人。
    公共的社会主义所有制带给了集体农庄的庄员巨大的物质利益。在革命前，贫农和中农生产二、五○○、○○○、○○○普特的谷物．而在这次爱国战争之前，集体农庄的庄员生产了六、○○○、○○○、○○○普特，即超过了三、五○○、○○○、○○○普特。
    集体农庄的成长是基于扩大的再生产和内部的社会主义的累积。政府给予了极大的帮助。在战争的前夜，集体农庄的不可分的财产，最要紧的国家财政经济，组成了二一、○○○、○○○、○○○卢布。其中百分之九十以上的款子是得之由集体农庄本身生产所积蓄的。因此只有百分之十的财产可以算作以前的农民的财产。
    集体农庄的公共财富是社会主义国家经济力的主要基础之一，同时也是每个诚实劳动庄员个人幸福的泉源。
    集体农庄是劳动农民的一个自愿的结合。集体劳动的最高行政机构是农民会议，农庄的许多重要问题都由这个会议来解决。斯大林的劳动组合章程上已经给予集体农庄管理民主原则以合法地位。
    庄员是他们的经济的绝对主人。他们对国家付出了应付的税之外，余下的物资和钱财根据劳动组合的章程，由他们自己决定怎么分配。。集体农庄的财产、出品和现款，如果不经过庄员全体大会而分配了，那是一件法律所不许的罪行。
    党和政府认为任何违反集体农庄行政的民主原则的行为，是对国家犯罪的行为。
    在领导集体农庄的发展上，布尔什维克党和政府也靠着集体农庄的民主主义和起着带头作用的人底创造性和建设性底努力，来更进一步地加强集体农庄的民主主义经济，更进一步的改善庄员们的幸福。
