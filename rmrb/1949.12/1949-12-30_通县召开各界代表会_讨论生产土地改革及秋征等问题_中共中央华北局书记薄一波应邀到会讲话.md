Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: The Tong County People's Representative Conference of Hebei Province was held from November 19th to 24th. A total of 394 representatives attended the meeting, including workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers, veterans, youth, women, cultural and educational circles, industrial and commercial circles, model workers, Hui people, freelancers, government staff, and enlightened gentry. Among them, representatives of peasants, workers, and students were produced through elections, while representatives of government organs were recommended, and enlightened gentry and teachers were invited by the Tong County People's Government.

On the first day of the meeting, Li Zifan, the County Chief of the Tong County People's Government, reported on the government's work over the past year and proposed the future work policy.

Summarizing nearly 3,000 proposals, it was decided to focus the meeting discussions on the three issues with the most proposals: production, land reform, and autumn grain collection.

On the second day of the meeting, Li Yingming, a representative of the Tong County Committee of the CCP, gave a detailed explanation of the Hebei Provincial People's Government's proclamation on land reform. Zhang Jichuan, the head of the Finance and Grain Section of the County Government, announced the amount that each district in the county should bear this year and explained the government's specific measures to take care of disaster areas. In the evening, the representatives divided into twenty-one groups for discussion. The presidium compiled and sorted the 2,964 proposals received, dividing them into nine categories: production and construction, land reform, agricultural tax collection, public security, sanitation, disaster relief, and culture and education, totaling 399 items, which were printed and distributed to each group for discussion. It was determined that the three issues with the most proposals: production, land reform, and autumn grain collection would be the focus of the meeting's discussions.

Discussing Land Reform Issues
Should landlords be beaten or not? Should the land offered by middle peasants be accepted or not? Why not touch the oil workshops and shops of landlords and rich peasants? The groups engaged in heated discussions.

On the third day, the groups continued to discuss, and the representatives mostly spoke out their opinions seriously and discussed very enthusiastically. For example, some people thought that for the too stubborn landlords, even if they were not beaten or deducted, they should be starved for two nights to vent their anger. But it was immediately opposed by others, pointing out that this method was wrong. Everyone believed that the feudal exploitation of the landlord class must be eliminated, but they should not be beaten, because beating people is a feudal practice, and we are against feudalism. Moreover, landlords are also useful labor forces, and they should be asked to work and transform them through production, which is also beneficial to the entire society. As for those heinous despotic landlords, they can be handed over to the people's court for legal handling. When some groups discussed what the policy of "keeping the middle unmoved and leveling the two ends" meant, most representatives realized that keeping the middle unmoved meant not moving the middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) and uniting the middle peasants. But some individual representatives asked, "Should we accept the land if the middle peasants want to offer it?" Peasant representative Sun Guangshan said, "Why shouldn't we accept it if he wants to offer it?" The group then started a debate, with five of the fourteen people in the group agreeing with his opinion and nine people opposing it. Representative Hou Wenjun said, "Whether middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants offer land, we should not accept it. Who wants to cut off their own flesh? If he wants to offer land, let's think about whether there is a problem with our work? He must have concerns. Not only should we not accept it, but we should also explain it to him." After discussion, the whole group agreed with his opinion. Regarding the protection of industry and commerce, all groups realized that it was beneficial to the development of production and said that the oil workshops, flour mills, shops, and other industries and businesses of landlords and rich peasants must not be touched. When discussing class delineation, all groups focused on the difference between well-to-do middle peasants and rich peasants, believing that well-to-do middle peasants are also middle peasants and our own people, and we cannot treat relatives as enemies. When discussing the autumn grain collection issue, some representatives initially felt that the burden was heavy. After discussion and calculation, all groups generally believed that this year's burden was much lighter than during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, the enemy arbitrarily collected, robbed, and extorted, and some gun money was much more than this year's public grain. Everyone said that although this year is very difficult, the public grain must be completed well. One representative said, "The front is still fighting, and the rear needs to be built. The country is also in difficulty, just like us!"

　　通县召开各界代表会
    讨论生产土地改革及秋征等问题
    中共中央华北局书记薄一波应邀到会讲话
    【新华社北京二十九日电】河北省通县各界人民代表会议，已于十一月十九日至二十四日举行。到会代表共三百九十四名。包括工人、农民、革命军人、荣誉军人、青年、妇女、文化教育界、工商界、劳动模范、回民、自由职业者、机关工作人员、开明士绅。其中农民、工人与学生代表是采用选举方式产生的，机关代表是推选，开明士绅、教职员系由通县人民政府聘请。
    会议第一日，由通县人民政府县长李子凡报告一年来的政府工作，并提出今后的工作方针。
    综合近三千件的提案，确定以件数最多的生产、土地改革、秋征三个问题作会议讨论中心。
    会议第二日，中共通县委会代表李英明，对河北省人民政府关于土地改革布告作了详细解释。县府财粮科长张继川宜布了今年全县各区应负担的数目，讲解了政府照顾灾区的具体措施。当晚，与会代表分二十一个小组进行讨论。主席团将所收到之二千九百六十四件提案加以综合整理，分为生产建设、土地改革、征收农业税、治安、卫生、救灾、文化教育等九类，计三百九十九件，印制成册，分发各小组讨论，并确定以件数最多的生产、土地改革、秋征三个问题为会议讨论的中心问题。
   讨论土地改革问题
   地主该打不该打？中农献地该要不该要？为什么不动地主富农的油房店铺？各小组热烈进行了讨论。
    第三日，各小组继续进行讨论，代表们大都认真地讲出自己的意见，讨论得很热烈。如有的人认为土地改革对太顽固的地主不打、不扣也要饿他两宿才解气。但立刻就遭到别人的反对，指出这种办法是不对的。大家认为：地主阶级的封建剥削必须消灭，但不要打他，因为打人是封建的作法，我们是反对封建的，而且地主也是有用的劳动力，应该叫他劳动，从生产中改造他们，对整个社会也有好处。至于那些罪大恶极的恶霸地主，则可交人民法庭依法处理。有些小组讨论什么叫“中间不动两头平”的政策时，大多数代表均认识到中间不动就是不动中农（包括富裕中农），团结中农。但有个别代表提出：“中农要献地，我们是不是要？”农民代表孙广山说：“他要献，我们为什么不要呢？”该组于是展开了争论，全组十四人有五个人同意他这个意见。九个人反对。代表侯文俊说：“不管中农或富裕中农献地，我们都不应要，谁愿意割下自己身上的肉？他要献地，咱们就想想工作上有毛病没有？他一定有顾虑的。咱们不但不要，还要向他解释。”经过讨论，全组都同意他的意见了。关于保护工商业，各小组均认识到，对发展生产有好处，都说地主富农的油房、粉房、店铺等工商业坚决不能动。在讨论划阶级时，各小组都把重点放在富裕中农与富农的区别上，认为富裕中农也是中农，是自己人，不能把亲人当仇人。讨论秋征问题时，开始有的代表感到负担重，经过讨论计算后，各组普遍认为今年负担比国民党反动派统治时轻多了，那时敌人随便征抢、勒索，一此枪款就比今年公粮多得多，大家都说今年虽然很困难，公粮还是要好好完成。有一位代表说：“前方还在打仗，后方又要建设，国家也和咱们一样有困难呢！”
