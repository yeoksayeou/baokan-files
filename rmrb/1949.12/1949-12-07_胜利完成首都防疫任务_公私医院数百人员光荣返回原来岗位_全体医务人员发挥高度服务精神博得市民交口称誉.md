　　Triumphantly Completing the Capital's Epidemic Prevention Task
　　Hundreds of Personnel from Public and Private Hospitals Gloriously Return to Their Original Posts
　　All Medical Staff Display High-Level Service Spirit, Winning Unanimous Praise from Citizens
　　[Beijing News] The quarantine stations and epidemic prevention stations established throughout the urban and suburban districts of Beijing, as well as at various city gates and stations, to prevent the invasion of bubonic plague into the capital, have been successively dismantled starting on December 6th. Medical personnel participating in the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee's epidemic prevention team, assigned to the blockade line across the northwest suburbs of Beijing, as well as quarantine and epidemic prevention stations at various city gates and stations, are now returning to the epidemic prevention team in batches after nearly a month and a half of diligent service, and will soon return to their respective work posts. These medical personnel, including doctors and nurses from Peking University Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, the Health Department and Health Bureau of the North China Military Region and their affiliated hospitals and institutions, total 365. In addition, 70 fifth-year students from Peking University Medical College, who conducted a concentrated, week-long universal vaccination campaign in the suburbs of Beijing, and 19 students from the Gongyi Midwifery School who formed mobile injection teams in the city, as well as doctors and nurses from public and private hospitals who enthusiastically participated in preventive vaccination work during the epidemic prevention period, have all successfully completed their tasks and returned to their posts one after another.

　　These medical workers, at the critical moment of the tense plague situation in Chahar, resolutely put aside other work and joined the fight to prevent the plague from invading the capital in order to complete the task of "not allowing the plague to invade the capital." When the 22 doctors and nurses from Peking Union Medical College received the approval of the hospital and decided to participate in quarantine work in the suburbs, they all packed their luggage and asked to "go to the front line." After the cadres of the Health Department of the North China Military Region accepted the task, they rushed to Beijing from Tongxian and even Shijiazhuang, and immediately asked to "go to work in the suburbs." They have been responsible for the quarantine work from the northern suburbs to the eastern suburbs from beginning to end, without changing shifts. At the meeting convened by the Medical Workers Association, more than a dozen students from Gongyi Midwifery School reported on the spot that they had been under the leadership of the Epidemic Prevention Team, traveling back and forth between various districts of Beijing to give injections to citizens. Some doctors and nurses from Peking University Hospital and Municipal Hospital were responsible for the quarantine work at the city gates. They did not pick work locations or shift times, and were actively and responsibly implementing quarantine on the masses entering and leaving the city gates. Ning Manling, a nurse at Peking University Hospital, had a fever due to illness, but in order to be responsible to the people of the whole city, she insisted on working until someone took over before going to rest. The Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee's Epidemic Prevention Team was organized with such a high degree of voluntary spirit and such excellent working cadres. While carrying out quarantine and epidemic prevention work, the medical personnel of the Beijing Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital and various isolation facilities, who lived directly with suspected plague patients, also worked day and night with the same active and responsible attitude.

　　Private hospitals also actively participated in this epidemic prevention work. Taking the Seventh District as an example, 21 of the 22 private hospitals and clinics of a certain scale in the district participated in the work. All three people from Huiping Hospital came out, and Deng Jinqian, the director of the Children's Hospital, also personally came out to give injections. The district regularly sent 20 doctors and 30 nurses to work, forming 13 injection teams, working five hours a day. They were very serious about disinfection, and many doctors also brought stethoscopes to examine sick people to see if they could be injected. Regarding this serious and responsible work spirit, the masses have reflected: "This injection is really serious, even the doctor came out," "The injection is very careful, not painful at all."

　　Many medical personnel not only used their working time and their technology to serve the people, but also donated a lot of medical equipment. For example, the director of the private Lilan Hospital in the Ninth District took out two dozen needles himself to give injections to the masses. Doctors Zhang and Yu of the Mentougou Epidemic Prevention Station also donated their own injection equipment, iodine tablets and alcohol. Before the alcohol from the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee was distributed to the injection team in the Seventh District, the doctors brought their own alcohol for injection. Someone once suggested that they use carbolic acid for disinfection, but they sternly refused.

　　Medical workers not only actively participated in quarantine work and injection work, but also actively participated in mass propaganda work. Twelve doctors from Peking University Hospital formed a propaganda team, taking time out of their professional work to travel back and forth between the twelve districts of the urban and rural areas every day, cooperating with the work of the epidemic prevention sub-committees and branches, and teaching basic knowledge of plague prevention and control to cadres and the masses. The first and fifth injection teams in the Seventh District constantly explained epidemic prevention knowledge to the masses waiting for injections, and the masses were willing to listen and easily accepted it. The staff of Peking Union Medical College at the northwest suburban quarantine station used their spare time to give physical examinations to nearby residents and primary school students, and carried out publicity and education on hygiene knowledge. Through this plague prevention work, the relationship between the general public and medical personnel has been greatly enhanced, laying a very favorable foundation for future work to protect the health of the people in the capital.

　　胜利完成首都防疫任务
    公私医院数百人员光荣返回原来岗位
    全体医务人员发挥高度服务精神博得市民交口称誉
    【北京讯】遍布北京市城、郊各区及各城门，各车站，为防止鼠疫侵袭首都而设的检疫站和防疫站，已从十二月六日起陆续撤除。参加北京市防疫委员会防疫大队，分配在横亘京西北郊封锁线上及各城门、车站检疫站和防疫站上的医务人员，在辛劳服务将近一个半月以后，现正分批光荣撤归防疫大队，并且即可返回各自的工作岗位。这些医务人员，包括北大医院、协和医学院、华北军区卫生部和卫生局及其附属院所的大夫、护士，一共三百六十五人。另外，在京郊以一周时间突击进行普遍注射活菌鼠疫疫苗的北大医学院五年级同学七十人，和在城内组成机动注射组的公益助产学校同学十九人，以及在防疫期间踊跃参加预防注射工作的各公、私立医院的大夫、护士等，也都胜利完成任务，先后各返岗位。
    这些医务工作者是在察北鼠疫疫情紧张的关头，为完成“不准鼠疫侵入首都”的任务，毅然搁下其他工作，参加了预防鼠疫的斗争的。当协和医学院的二十二个大夫、护士得到院方同意，决定参加郊区检疫工作的时候，全都捆好行李，要求“到最前方去”。华北军区卫生部的干部接受任务以后，从通县甚至石家庄赶道来京，马上要求“到郊区工作去”。他们自始至终担任着北郊到东郊的检疫工作，没有换班。在医务工作者协会召开的会议上，公益助产学校的十几个同学当场报告，她们一直在防疫大队的领导下，机动往返在京市各区之间，给市民注射。北大医院和市立医院的一部大夫和护士担任城门检疫工作，他们不挑选工作地点，不挑选值班时间，积极负责地对进出城门的群众施行检疫，北大医院护士甯曼玲有病发烧，但是为了对全市人民负责，一直坚持到有人接班才去休息。北京市防疫委员会防疫大队就是以这样高度的自愿精神，由这样优秀的工作干部组织起来的，在检疫与防疫工作的同时，北京市传染病院和各隔离所的医务人员，直接和鼠疫疑似患者生活在一起，也以同样积极负责的态度，日以继夜地工作着。
    私立医院也积极参加了这次防疫工作。以第七区为例，全区稍具规模的二十二个私营医院和诊疗所当中，有二十一个参加了工作，惠平医院的三个人全都出来了，儿童医院的主任大夫邓金鍌也亲自出来注射。该区经常有二十个大夫和三十个护士出动工作，组成十三个注射组，每天坚持五小时工作。他们对消毒十分认真，好多大夫还带着听诊器给有病的人诊查，看他是否可以注射。对于这种严肃负责的工作精神，群众纷纷反映：“这次注射真认真，连大夫都出来了”，“打的真仔细，一点也不痛”。
    好多医务人员不但以自己的工作时间和自己的技术来为人民服务，同时他们还曾献出不少医药器材。例如九区私立礼兰医院院长自己拿出两打针头给群众注射，门头沟防疫站张大夫和于大夫也捐出自己的注射器材、碘片和酒精等。第七区的注射组当市防疫委员会的酒精没有发下以前，大夫们就自带酒精进行注射，曾经有人建议他们用石炭酸消毒，被他们严词拒绝了。
    医务工作者们不但积极参加了检疫工作和注射工作，而且积极参加了群众宣传工作。北大医院的十二个医生组成了一个宣传队，抽出业务工作的空暇，每天分别往返于城厢十二个区，配合防疫分会和支会的工作，把对防治鼠疫的基本知识教给干部和群众。第七区第一和第五两个注射组不断给等候注射的群众讲解防疫常识，群众愿意听，也容易接受。西北郊检疫站上协和医院的工作人员利用工作的余暇给附近群众及小学生作了体格检查，并且进行卫生常识的宣传教育工作。经过这次预防鼠疫的工作，广大市民与医务人员的关系大大密切起来，给今后保卫首都人民健康的工作，打下十分有利的基础。
