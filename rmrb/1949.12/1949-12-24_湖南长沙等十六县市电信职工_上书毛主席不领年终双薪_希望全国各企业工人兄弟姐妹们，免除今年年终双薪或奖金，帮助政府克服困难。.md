    Telecom Workers in Changsha and Sixteen Other Counties and Cities in Hunan Province
    Write to Chairman Mao, Declining Year-End Double Pay
    Hoping that Workers, Brothers, and Sisters in Enterprises Across the Country Will Waive This Year's Year-End Double Pay or Bonuses to Help the Government Overcome Difficulties.

　　The entire staff of the Telecommunications Bureaus in sixteen counties and cities in Hunan Province, including Changsha, Yuanling, and Changde, recently wrote to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, expressing their support for the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Commission and the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, declining this year's year-end double pay or bonuses in order to reduce the burden on the people and help the government overcome financial difficulties. The telegram reads as follows: To the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the National Telecommunications Trade Union, forwarded to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    We, the entire staff of the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau and sixteen other bureaus including Yuanling and Xiangtan, are extremely grateful upon learning of the Central Financial and Economic Commission's handling of the year-end double pay and bonuses for certain publicly owned enterprises and seeing the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' letter to workers! The government is determined to protect the interests of workers and cares for us workers with painstaking effort. We thoroughly support the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    Currently, the country is at the time of the final and complete victory of the revolutionary war, and in some corners, the war to completely eliminate the remaining bandits is still ongoing. Our government and people are supporting the complete victory of this great war today, restoring various undertakings damaged by the war, and developing production and construction, etc. Financially, it is very difficult. The financial deficit for 1950 is already significant. If certain publicly owned enterprises issue year-end bonuses or double pay this year, this will further increase the government's financial deficit, increase the burden on the people, and increase currency issuance. At a time when production is recovering and developing, this will inevitably stimulate inflation, affect the lives of the entire people, and cause great losses to the restoration and development of production undertakings. Therefore, we, the entire staff of the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau and sixteen other bureaus including Yuanling and Xiangtan, in order to support the final victory of the revolutionary war, help the government engage in production and construction and restore various undertakings damaged by the war, and in the spirit of sacrificing private interests for public good, unanimously request not to receive year-end bonuses or double pay, in order to reduce the burden on the people and help our own government solve financial difficulties. We are also prepared to actively participate in production, initiate production competitions, and work hard to study and improve our political awareness, in order to complete the task of New Democratic construction. We deeply know that the strength of our sixteen telecommunications bureaus is very limited. We hope that our worker brothers and sisters in all enterprise departments across the country will endure hardship together, do more work, practice thrift, endure temporary difficulties, waive this year's year-end double pay and bonuses, and practice production and economy, using this practical action to help the government overcome current financial difficulties and jointly seek the early success of the great cause. Preparatory Office of the Hunan Provincial Telecommunications Trade Union, Changsha Telecommunications Trade Union, Preparatory Committees of Yuanling, Changde, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, Pingjiang, Xiangxiang, Liling, Lingling Telecommunications Trade Unions, Entire Staff of Yiyang, Yueyang, Liuyang, Ningxiang, Cili, Yongfeng, and Anjiang Telecommunications Bureaus, respectfully.

　　湖南长沙等十六县市电信职工
    上书毛主席不领年终双薪         
    希望全国各企业工人兄弟姐妹们，免除今年年终双薪或奖金，帮助政府克服困难。
    【新华社北京二十三日电】湖南省长沙、沅陵、常德等十六个县市电信局的全体职工，最近上书中央人民政府毛泽东主席，表示拥护中央财政经济委员会的决定和全国总工会的号召，不领今年的年终双薪或奖金，以减轻人民负担，帮助政府克服财政困难。电文如下：中华全国总工会、全国电信总工会筹委会转呈中央人民政府毛主席：
    我们长沙电信局及沅陵、湘潭等十六局全体电信职工得悉了中央财经委员会关于某些公营企业部门年终双薪和奖金的处理办法和看到了全国总工会告工人书后我们万分感戴！政府坚决保护职工利益，爱护我们职工的苦心孤诣，我们彻底拥护全国总工会的号召。
    目前全国正处在革命战争最后全部胜利的时候，某些角落还在进行着彻底肃清残余匪军的战争。我们政府和人民今天支持这一伟大战争的彻底胜利，恢复被战争破坏的各种事业，发展生产建设等，财政上十分困难，一九五○年的财政赤字已形不小，如果今年某些公营企业部门再发年奖金或双薪，这将更增加了政府的财政赤字，加重人民负担，增发通货，在今天生产正在恢复发展之际，势将刺激通货膨胀，影响整个人民生活，使恢复与发展生产事业将受到很大损失。因此，我们长沙电信局及沅陵、湘潭等十六局全体电信职工，为支援革命战争最后胜利，帮助政府从事生产建设与恢复因战争破坏的各种事业，本舍私为公的精神，一致签请不领年终奖金或双薪，以减轻人民负担，帮助我们自己的政府解决财政上的困难。我们并准备积极参加生产，发起生产竞赛，努力学习，提高我们的政治觉悟，以完成新民主主义的建设任务。我们深知，仅我们十六局电信职工的力量是非常有限的，希望我们全国的各企业部门工人兄弟姐妹们、一致吃得苦，做得多，节衣缩食，忍受一时困难，将今年年终双薪和奖金予以免除，厉行生产节约，用这个实际行动，来帮助政府渡过目前财经的困难，共谋大业之早成。湖南省电信工会筹备处，长沙电信工会，沅陵、常德、湘潭、株州、平江、湘乡、醴陵、零陵电信工会筹委会，益阳、岳阳、浏阳、宁乡、慈利、永丰、安江电信局全体职工谨上。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十二月二十日
