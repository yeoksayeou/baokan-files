　　We Workers Should Look Far Ahead, Endure Hardship First, and Enjoy Comfort Later

　　[Beijing News] The employees of public factories and enterprises in Beijing unanimously support the decision of the Financial and Economic Commission and are currently展开 discussing and studying specific implementation measures. The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau and its subordinate units are conducting earnest discussions. The fifth group of the Seventh Bureau's Trade Union voluntarily gave up their year-end bonuses. Switchboard operators Zhao Kuixing and Zhao Yunzhong said during the discussion: "When the country is in difficulty, we should contribute our strength. Our food and clothing are much better now, and we should save more for the country." Comrade Zhao Zhongming, who is over sixty years old, said: "We are eating and drinking well, and we are even learning culture. Shouldn't we think about the government? Saving on bonuses also amounts to a large expenditure. We workers should look far ahead." All 4,700 employees of the China People's Printing Factory also voluntarily gave up their year-end double salary, saving nearly one million catties of millet.

　　Due to the general increase in the consciousness of the working class, people have expressed: "Since liberation, our lives have improved a lot. We can often eat rice and white flour. Now that we have such a life, we should think about the lives of the people across the country, the lives of the soldiers on the front lines, and the lives of our newly liberated worker brothers. Why should we ask for double salary if we don't save more money for the country?" Worker Cui Xinyi from the Leveling Group said: "It was right to demand double salary from the Kuomintang reactionaries because they exploited us. The money they gave us wasn't even enough to eat. Now we are not exploited, and we have enough to eat and wear. The country is not completely liberated yet, and we workers should look far ahead." More than a thousand employees of the Intaglio Printing Department held meetings in the form of a representative conference to discuss the matter. The employees spoke enthusiastically and discussed it seriously. Finally, they unanimously voted to forgo their year-end double salary. On the 22nd of this month, the factory held an expanded meeting of party, government, trade union, and youth league cadres, where the factory director, He Xiaochu, formally accepted the workers' opinions and announced that no year-end double salary would be issued. However, to reward all employees for their hard work throughout the year, it was decided that each person would receive two catties of white flour and one catty of meat as a reward for the New Year.

　　(Editor's note: Regarding year-end double salaries or bonuses, it is imperative that the trade union and administration conduct propaganda and mobilization to raise the consciousness of the working class, allowing employees to consciously and voluntarily receive less or give them up. The practice of some factories using "representative conferences" and "unanimous adoption" is neither prudent nor appropriate. The trade union of the Fengtai Cement Component Factory carefully soliciting the opinions of each worker is something that can be learned from.)

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: Employees of public enterprises in Qingdao and Zhangjiakou have expressed their willingness to give up their year-end bonuses to help the government overcome financial difficulties. In Qingdao, the state-owned and public enterprise employees who submitted letters to the military control commission and enterprise leaders expressing their willingness to give up their year-end bonuses included: 754 employees of the Bank of China, more than 360 employees of the Telecommunications Bureau, more than 106 employees of the Yellow Sea Aquatic Products Company, all employees of the Soy Sauce Brewery, more than 444 employees of the China Textile Factory No. 9, all employees of the Qilu Vegetable Oil Factory, 31 employees of the China Textile Branch Company, and 70 employees of the China Textile Factory No. 4. A letter from all employees of the Qilu Vegetable Oil Factory to the factory director said: "The government is currently facing financial difficulties, and we all have the responsibility to overcome these difficulties together. Although our lives are difficult now, we can still manage. Therefore, we refuse to receive any of the original year-end funds." Huang Jishu, a worker at the general warehouse of the China Textile Branch Company, said: "We workers are the leading class of the country, and we should endure hardship first and enjoy comfort later. The country is facing such financial difficulties, and we should all work together to overcome them."

　　On the 26th, the Zhangjiakou Telecommunications Bureau's trade union, on behalf of the bureau's employees, sent a telegram in response to the sixteen telecommunications bureaus in Changsha, Hunan, and the employees of the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau, who gave up their year-end funds. It also called on workers in state-owned enterprises across the country to respond jointly to help the government overcome its current financial difficulties.

　　我们工人要看远点吃苦在前享福在后
    【北京讯】京市各公营工厂、企业部门职工，一致拥护财经委员会的决定，目前正展开讨论，研究具体执行办法，北京电信局及所属各单位认真进行讨论，七局工会第五小组自愿放弃年终奖金，话务员赵魁升、赵允中在讨论时说：国家有了困难，我们应当出力，现在吃、穿都强多了，应当给国家多节省点。六十余岁的工友赵仲明说：“吃喝强，又学上了文化，我们还不为政府想想，奖金省多了，也是一大笔开销，我们工人要看远点”。中国人民印刷厂全体职工四千七百余人，也都自愿不领年终双薪，节省小米近一百万斤。
    由于职工阶级觉悟普遍提高，纷纷表示：解放以后，咱们生活改善多了，经常可以吃上大米白面，咱们有了这样的生活，应该想到全国人民的生活，前方战士的生活，和刚被解放的工人兄弟们的生活，咱们还不多给国家省点钱，要双薪干啥用？压平组工人崔信一说：“跟国民党反动派要双薪那是对的，因为它剥削我们，给那几个钱也吃不饱；现在咱们不受剥削，吃穿全可以，全国还没完全解放，我们工人应该看得远远的。”凹印科一千多职工采用代表会议的方式开会讨论，职工普遍热烈发言，认真讨论，最后一致表决通过不要年终双薪。该厂于本月二十二日举行党、政、工、团扩大干部会议，由该厂贺晓初厂长正式接受工人们的意见，宣布不发年终双薪，但为了慰劳全体职工一年来的辛劳，决定在新处年时每人发给白面二斤、肉一斤作为酬劳。
    （编者按：关于年终双薪或奖金要确实是经过工会、行政宣传动员以提高工人阶级觉悟，让职工自觉自愿的少领或放弃，有的工厂采用“代表会议”“一致通过”的方式，则是既不慎重更不妥当的。丰台洋灰筑件厂工会慎重征求每一个工友的意见是可以学习的。）
    【新华社北京二十七日电】青岛、张家口两地公营企业职工纷纷表示愿意放弃年终奖金，帮助政府渡过财政困难。青岛市国营及公营企业职工上书军管会及企业负责人表示放弃年终奖金的计有：中国银行职员七百五十四人，电信局职工三百六十余人，黄海水产职工一百零六人，酱油酿造厂全厂员工，中纺九厂职工四百四十四人，齐鲁植物油厂全体员工，中纺分公司员工三十一人，中纺四厂员工七十人。齐鲁植物油厂全体员工致该厂厂长的信说：“目前政府财政困难，我们都有齐心克服困难的责任。我们现在的生活虽然苦，但仍能维持，因此我们对于原有的年终资金一律谢绝领受。中纺分公司总库工人黄继述说：我们工人是国家的领导阶级，应该吃苦在先，享福在后，国家财政这样困难，应该我们大家来克服。
    张家口电信局工会于二十六日代表该局职通电响应湖南长沙等十六电信局及太原电信局职工放弃年终资金，并号召全国国营企业工友共同响应，以帮助政府渡过目前财政困难。
