Undesirable Work Styles
    Wang Zoumo
    On November 23rd, village cadres from Shenjiashan in Lucheng, Shanxi, took land certificates to the county government for stamping. The first time they met a certain clerk, the clerk said, "I'm busy now, come back in the afternoon!"; The second time they went, they ran into him "eating"; The third time they went, the clerk again said, "Why didn't you come earlier? I'm off work. Don't you know the rules?" This village cadre was not familiar with the city, had no place to eat or stay, and didn't know when it would be a time that conformed to the "rules," leaving him at a loss!
    Han Hantou, a disabled veteran from Shentou Village in Lucheng, returned after being discharged from the army in November and went to the Civil Affairs Department of the county government to complete his discharge procedures. The first time he went, a certain clerk said, "I'm eating, can't make it." After the meal, he went again, and the clerk said, "I'm off work, come back tonight." When he went again that night, the clerk said, "It's dark today, let's do it tomorrow!" Han had difficulty with his legs. It was thirty *li* back home, and he didn't have much money to stay, so he had to spend the night in the open.
    This kind of failure to handle matters according to the actual situation, failure to understand the difficulties of the rural masses, procrastination, buck-passing, and empty talk of "rules" is a remnant of the old "yamen" work style and is absolutely undesirable. The people's county government will not allow such individual bureaucrats to corrupt our fine traditions!

　　要不得的作风
    王走谟
    十一月二十三日，山西潞城申家山的村干部，带着要发给农民的土地证到县府去盖印，第一次见了某科员，某科员说：“现在没空，下午再来！”；第二次去，又碰上“正在吃饭”；第三次去，某科员又说：“你为啥不早来，下办公了，你不知道制度？”这位村干部在城内不熟，无吃无住的地方，又不知道要什么时候才是合乎“制度”的时候，弄得走头无路！
    潞城神头村的荣军韩憨头，十一月退伍回来，到县府民政科办退伍手续。第一次去，某科员说：“正在吃饭，赶不上。”饭后再去，又说：“下了办公，晚上再来。”晚上再去，又说：“今天黑了，明天办吧！”韩某腿不方便，回家吧，还有三十里地，住下吧，又无多的用费，只得露宿了一夜。
    象这种不按实际情况办事，不体会农村群众的困难，拖拖拉拉，推推诿诿，而空言“制度”这是袭染了旧“衙门”作风的残余，是要不得的。人民的县政府是不允许这样个别官僚主义分子来败坏我们的优良作风的！
