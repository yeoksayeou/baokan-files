A Great Achievement on the Longhai Railway!
The Nation's Highest 45-Meter-High Bridge Repaired and Reopened 20 Days Ahead of Schedule.
Introduction to Bridge No. 8

    Bridge No. 8 is said to be the highest bridge in the country, standing 45 meters high and 151.46 meters long. It is located at kilometer 782.611 on the Longhai Railway between Guanyintang and Xiashi. It is a crossbeam between two mountains. 42 meters east of the bridge is the Huaigou Mountain Tunnel, which is 257 meters long, and 200 meters further east is the Ganhao Mountain Tunnel, which is 247 meters long.
    The bridge was originally built by the French, starting in 1919 and completed in 1922, with five stone piers. Originally, it had two spans of plate girder and four spans of truss girder on top. In 1944, when the Japanese invaders attacked western Henan, the Kuomintang forces collapsed and retreated in a panic, destroying the entire bridge. After the Japanese occupied western Henan, they planned to rebuild it, but due to the massive scale of the project, they were unable to do so. After the liberation, the Kuomintang planned to repair it again, but due to a lack of materials, they decided to fill in Bridge No. 2, which was about 600 meters away from Bridge No. 8, and combine the unloaded upper truss girder with the undamaged truss bridge of Bridge No. 8 to rebuild Bridge No. 8. Construction began in 1946, taking a year to build a wooden trestle bridge for traffic, and then more than four months to build five concrete piers on the original foundation. Before it could be completed, it was destroyed in the self-defense war. This time, under the call of "Repairing the Longhai Railway to Liberate the Great Northwest," the First Detachment of our Railway Corps officially started construction on September 10th and completed all the foundation work by the end of September. The girder erection began in early October, and the project was successfully completed on October 8th. The entire process took two months, completing this arduous task 20 days ahead of schedule.

    陇海路一大创举！
    全国有数的四十五米高桥提前二十天修复通车
    八号高介绍
    八号挢据说是全国最高的一座桥梁，高四十五米，长一五一·四六米，位于陇海路观音堂，硖石间七八二公里六一一米处。是两山中间的一座横梁，桥东岸四二米处，就是长二五七米的槐沟山洞，再东二○○米处又有二四七米的干壕山洞一座。
    该桥是最初系法人所建，一九一九年开工，一九二二年竣工，计石头桥墩五座，原架上承钣梁两孔，上承花梁四孔。一九四四年日寇进攻豫西，国民党狼狈溃退时，全部破坏。日寇进占豫西后，曾计划兴修，但因工程浩大，未能复建，光复后国民党计划再次修复，但因材料缺乏，遂决定，将距八号桥约六百米的二号桥填死，将卸下的上承花梁与八号桥未毁花桥合并重建八号桥，一九四六年动工，费时一年，搭木排架便桥通车，又费时四月余原基础上修起混凝土洋灰墩五座，未及修成，便在自卫战争中被破坏。这次我铁道兵团第一支队在“修通陇海路解放大西北”的号召下于九月十日正式开工，九月底完全全部基础工作。十月初开始架梁，十月八日胜利竣工。前后历时两月，提前二十日完此一艰巨大任务。
