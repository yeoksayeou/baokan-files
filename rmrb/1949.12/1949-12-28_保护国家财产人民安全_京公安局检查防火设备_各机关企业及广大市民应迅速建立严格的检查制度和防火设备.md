【Beijing News】 In light of the recent increase in fire alarms, the Beijing Public Security Bureau's Elimination Team has begun focusing on inspecting fire prevention equipment in various agencies and enterprises, and is conducting extensive publicity among citizens. From the 1st to the 26th of this month, 22 fire alarms occurred in the city, nine of which resulted in disasters, an increase of four compared to the entire month of November. Among these 22 fire alarms, nine occurred in agencies and enterprises, resulting in significant losses of over 450 million yuan. The causes of the fires are mostly due to carelessness with stoves during the winter and dry weather, but mainly due to a lack of regular inspections, lax management, and a paralyzing mindset that prevents prompt reporting, resulting in the loss of state assets. For example, the fire alarms at the No. 4 Warehouse of the Beijing Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and North China University were caused by carelessness with stoves and chimneys. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute's breeding farm stored 60,000 jin of straw without regular inspections. The fire was only reported to the fire brigade five hours after it started, resulting in the total destruction of the straw. After a fire broke out in the kitchen of the Army Hospital, even the hospital's own fire brigade was not immediately notified. By the time the fire brigade heard the news and arrived, the reservoir had no water, and they had to find another water source, which caused the fire to spread. In order to protect state property and the safety of the people, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has begun to focus on inspecting various agencies, industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing, and is conducting extensive publicity in radio stations, cinemas and other places. All units internally and the general public should, in accordance with the guidance of the Public Security Bureau, quickly establish strict inspection systems and fire prevention equipment, and regularly check stoves, dilapidated wires, dry and flammable materials and places prone to fire, in order to avoid or reduce the occurrence of fire alarms; at the same time, protect water sources for timely use. If a fire does occur, extinguish it immediately and report it to the Municipal Fire Brigade (telephone ○9 or 5, ○100) in time to prevent the fire from spreading.

　  京公安局检查防火设备
    各机关企业及广大市民应迅速建立严格的检查制度和防火设备
    【北京讯】京市公安局消除队鉴于最近火警次数增多，对各机关、企业开始重点检查防火设备工作，并对市民展开广泛宣传。市内自本月一日到二十六日，即发生火警廿二起，成灾九起，较十一月全月增加四起。这二十二起火警中，机关和企业部门占了九起，损失也较大，达四亿五千余万元以上。起火原因多由于冬季炉火不慎和天气干燥，但主要由于平时失于检查，管理松弛，临时又不迅速报告等麻痹思想，致使国家财富遭受损失。如财政部北京供庆局第四仓库及华北大学等处的火警，都是由炉灶、烟筒不慎所引起；西郊华北农业科学研究所繁殖场存放六万斤稻草，平时不加检查，起火五小时后才报告消防队，致全部烧光；陆军医院厨房失火后，连该院自己的消防队都未立时通知，待该消防队闻声赶到后，又因贮水池没有贮水，临时还得另找水源，致蔓延成灾。为了保护国家财产及人民安全，市公安局开始对京市各机关、工矿企业等作重点检查，并在电台、电影院等处展开广泛宣传。各单位内部及广大市民，应根据公安局的指导，迅速建立严格的检查制度和防火设备，对于炉火、破旧电线、干燥易燃物品和容易滋火地方随时检查，以避免或减少发生火警；同时并保护水源，以备及时可用。如一旦发生火警，应立即施行扑救，并及时报告市消防队（电话○九或五、○一○○），以防止火势蔓延。
