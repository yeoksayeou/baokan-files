　　On Individuality
    熊健
    Individuality is the individual character within the universality of a class. The nature of a class is the same, but within the same class, individuality manifests as being largely similar but with minor differences. Class nature is expressed through individuality. The perceived conflict between collectivism and individuality should be understood as the conflict between the individual consciousness of the non-proletariat and collectivism. Individuality is not some mysterious thing; it possesses a definite class nature.

    Capitalist society only permits the full development of individualistic personalities of a small minority. For the majority, the development of individuality is restricted. However, the individuality of the oppressed people can be developed in class struggle.

    The individuality of intellectuals from petty-bourgeois backgrounds also reflects the characteristics of the petty-bourgeoisie. If we want to transform ourselves, then we must never say "That's just my personality" to avoid or deflect correct criticism. We must overcome the idea of "peaceful coexistence" between new and old thoughts, and strive to use proletarian collectivism to transform and replace the individualistic personality of non-proletarian consciousness.

　　谈个性
    熊健
    个性是阶级普遍性中的个别的性格，阶级的性质是一样的，在同一阶级中个性则表现为大同小异，阶级性是经过个性来表现的，说集体主义与个性矛盾应该理解为非无产阶级的个人意识与集体主义的矛盾，个性不是别的神秘的东西，它是有一定的阶级性的。
    资本主义社会只容许少数人底个人主义的个性充分发展，对大多数人说来，个性的发展是受限制的，但被压迫阶级的人们的个性，在阶级斗争中是可以得到发展的。
    小资产阶级出身的知识分子，其个性也是反映着小资产阶级的特性的，如果我们要改造自己，那么千万不要说“我个性就是这样”，来避免或搪塞正确的批评。我们要克服新旧思想“和平共居”的想法，要努力于用无产阶级底集体主义来改造、替代非无产阶级意识的个人主义的个性。
