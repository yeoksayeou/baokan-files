【Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou】Chahar Province is rich in flax, mustard, and abundant oilseeds. Under the policy of the People's Government to support and develop industrial production, the province's oil extraction industry is developing rapidly. The output of the state-owned Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory and the privately-owned Yuanxing Machine Oil Extraction Factory are increasing monthly. During the period of bandit-army rule, the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory suffered from insufficient oilseed sources due to the disruption of material flow between urban and rural areas. In addition, the workers' lives were too hard, and their enthusiasm for production was extremely low, resulting in a decrease in monthly output from over 4,000 jin at the time of Zhangjiakou's first liberation to 700 jin. However, since the factory officially resumed operations in January of this year, its monthly output has reached over 10,000 jin. In March, it rose to over 56,000 jin. In April and May, workers launched a production competition, working day and night in two shifts, and the monthly output immediately jumped to over 95,000 jin. In October, it even broke through the 100,000 jin production level. In addition to meeting local military and civilian needs, this year's pure flax oil shipped to Beijing and Tianjin for industrial production reached over 200,000 jin. The factory is now planning to expand production, preparing to produce 5.68 million jin of oil next year. The privately-owned Yuanxing Machine Oil Extraction Factory is also actively expanding production, and its monthly output in November reached over 32,000 jin.

Regarding raw materials, according to a survey by the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the annual output of flax and mustard this year reached over 35.98 million jin (including over 27.59 million jin of flax). In addition to supplying raw materials for the province's oil extraction industry, a large amount can also be exported. The oilseed output is most abundant in northern Chahar, followed by northern Yan, and less in southern Chahar.

While the machine oil extraction industry has not yet been able to develop on a large scale to fully supply the military and civilian needs of various rural towns, the traditional manual oil extraction workshops scattered in the oilseed-producing areas still play a role that cannot be ignored. According to a survey by the Provincial Department of Commerce, there are currently 532 oil extraction workshops in the province, supplying cooking oil and lamp oil to the rural masses. The Chahar Provincial Oil and Fat Company has adopted measures such as supplying raw materials and purchasing flax oil to support the production of traditional oil extraction, so that oil extraction households can obtain a profit of five jin of flax oil and by-products for every hundred jin of flax oil extracted.

To support the development of the oil and fat industry in Chahar Province, the North China Oil and Fat Company established a branch in Zhangyuan at the end of September to handle oilseed procurement and export business. According to the expansion plan of the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory for next year, the annual demand for oilseeds is over 22.6 million jin, accounting for approximately 66% of the total oilseed output of Chahar Province. The remainder will be used for oil extraction by private oil mills and traditional manual oil extraction workshops, and a portion will be exported. To achieve the procurement task, the branch company has made efforts in various aspects. In late November, to take care of the needs of the masses and cooperate with local price stabilization work, it has successively transported 9,000 bolts of native cloth, 500 bolts of foreign cloth, and 1,000 barrels of kerosene to oilseed-producing areas such as northern Chahar to exchange for oilseeds fairly and reasonably with the farmers. The Chahar Provincial People's Government has also adopted incentive policies to encourage farmers to grow more flax, and stipulates that oilseeds can be used instead of rice when collecting public grain, so that farmers who grow oil crops can obtain more benefits.

### 察省机器榨油业迅速扩大　张垣植物油厂产量逐月增加

　　察省机器榨油业迅速扩大
　  张垣植物油厂产量逐月增加
    【本报张家口专讯】察哈尔省盛产胡麻、芥子、油料十分充足。在人民政府扶助与发展工业生产的方针下，该省榨油工业正迅速发展。公营张垣植物油厂及私营元兴机器榨油厂生产量正在逐月上升。张垣植物油厂在匪军统治期间，由于城乡物资不能畅流，油料来源不足，加以工人生活太苦，生产情绪极低，致月产量由张市第一次解放时的四千余斤降为七百斤；但该厂自今年一月正式复工后，月产量即达一万余斤，三月份上升为五万六千余斤，四、五月间工人们开展了生产竞赛，日夜两班生产，月产量当即跃升为九万五千斤，十月份竟突破了十万斤的生产水平。产品除当地军需民用外，今年运往京、津供工业生产之用的纯葫油即达二十余万斤。现该厂正计划扩大生产，准备明年产油五百六十八万斤。私营元兴机器榨油厂目前也正在积极扩大生产，十一月份该厂月产量已达三万二千余斤。
    在原料方面，据省农业厅调查，葫麻、芥子今年年产量达三千五百九十八万余斤（内葫麻占两千七百五十九万余斤），除供应本省榨油工业原料外，并可大量输出。油料产量以察北为最丰，雁北次之，察南较少。
    当机器榨油业尚未能大量发展，充分供应各乡村城镇军需民食时，散布在油料产区的土法人工榨油作坊仍然有着不可忽视的作用。据省商业厅调查，目前全省榨油作坊尚有五百三十二家，供应农村群众的食油和灯油。察省油脂分公司为扶助土法榨油业的生产，曾采用供给原料，收购葫油，使榨油户每榨百斤葫油可得五斤葫油的盈利及副产物。
    为扶助察省油脂工业的发展，华北油脂公司于九月底在张垣建立分公司，办理油料收购及输出业务。根据张垣植物油厂明年扩大的生产的计划，全年需油料二千二百六十余万斤，约占察省油料总产量的百分之六十六强，其余除供私营榨油厂和土法手工榨油作坊榨油外，尚有部分油料出口。为达成收购任务该分公司已从各方面进行了努力，十一月下旬，为照顾群众需要与配合当地平稳物价工作，已陆续将九千匹土布、五百匹洋布及一千桶煤油运抵察北等油料产区，公平合理的与农民交换油料。察省人民政府亦采取奖励政策，推动农民多种葫麻，并规定征收公粮时油料可以代米，使种油脂作物的农民能多得利益。
