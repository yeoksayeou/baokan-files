　　Beijing Women's Production and Education Institute Trainees
  　Ideological Awareness Gradually Improves
    [Beijing News] The trainees of the Beijing Women's Production and Education Institute, after more than ten days of collective life and political education, have undergone many changes in their thinking, and a new atmosphere is generally emerging in various institutes. Having been accustomed to nightlife for a long time, their lives have now become regularized. The Education Institute stipulates that they get up at eight o'clock, but some people get up at six or seven in the morning, some clean the yard, and some study. They said: Living here is guaranteed, and we must study hard. The political studies being carried out in various institutes of the Education Institute generally focus on breaking down the concerns in their minds and arousing their hatred for the old society, while also introducing women labor heroes and work models such as "Woman Hero Liu Hulan," "Unyielding Hou Wu's Wife," and "Labor Hero Zhao Meiying." After a period of enlightening education, the trainees began to frankly talk about their backgrounds and expressed that they wanted to learn from the labor heroes. Sixteen-year-old Li Shuqin said, "Liu Hulan was also sixteen years old and so brave, I should really study hard!"
    On the morning of the 5th, the trainees of the Education Institute happily accepted the greetings from thirty female workers from the clothing factory and listened to them tell how they were forced into factories by life during the Kuomintang reactionary rule and how they suffered the contempt of others and the oppression of the Kuomintang rulers; after liberation, how workers were respected by society, how active the lives of workers were, and how enthusiastic and positive production was. The trainees were very excited to hear this, and they also began to think about participating in labor. Many people asked, "Is your factory still recruiting workers? We also want to go." Some said, "A few days ago, I only thought about finding a partner, but now I am determined to enter a factory." Students from Peking University Medical College and other schools also sent many letters of sympathy to the trainees of the Education Institute. They were deeply moved and discussed writing back. Zhou Zhulin, a trainee in the fifth institute, could not write, so she asked a colleague to write on her behalf. She said: "In the past, the head of the household made money from our bodies. When there were many guests, they would coax us with sweet words, but when there were few guests, they would give us a hard time, and no one sympathized with us. Unexpectedly, today the students care about us so much and even write to us. We are really excited. Now that the People's Government has saved us, we should study hard and become new women of the new society. We want to thank the People's Government and wish Chairman Mao long life!"

　　京妇女生产教养院学员
  　思想觉悟逐渐提高
    【北京讯】北京市妇女生产教养院的学员们，经过十几天的集体生活和政治教育，在思想上已起了不少变化，各所普遍呈现出新的气象。长期过惯了夜生活的她们，现在生活已经正规起来。教养院规定八点起床，但有些人清晨六、七点钟就起来，有的打扫院子，有的学习。她们表示：在这里生活有了保障，一定要好好学习。教养院各所进行着的政治学习，一般都以打破她们思想中的顾虑，启发她们对旧社会的痛恨为主，同时并介绍妇女劳动英雄和工作模范如“女英雄刘胡兰”、“坚贞不屈的侯五嫂”和“劳动英雄赵梅英”等。经过一段启发性的教育，学员们开始坦白说出她们的身世，并表示要向劳动英雄们学习，十六岁的李淑琴说：“人家刘胡兰也十六岁就那么勇敢，我真该好好学习啊！”
    五日上午，教养院的学员们愉快地接受了被服厂三十个女工的慰问，听她们讲述在国民党反动统治时期怎样被生活逼迫走进工厂，怎样遭受别人的白眼和国民党统治者的欺凌；解放后工人又怎样受到社会的尊重，工人的生活是怎样的活跃，生产是怎样的积极、热情。学员们听的很兴奋，她们也开始想参加劳动。好些人都问：“你们工厂还招工人不？我们也想去。”有的说：“前几天我还光想找对象，现在可决心进工厂了。”北大医学院等校的同学也曾给教养院的学员们很多慰问信，她们深深的被感动了，纷纷商量着写回信。五所学员周竹林不会写字，便找工作同志代写。她说：“从前领家拿我们的肉体赚钱，客人多的时候，便孩子长孩子短的哄着，客人少的时候，便给我们脸色看，没有人同情我们。想不到今天同学们这样关心我们，还给我们来信，我们真兴奋极了。现在人民政府救了我们，我们便该好好学习，做个新社会的新女性，我们要感谢人民政府，并祝毛主席万岁！”
