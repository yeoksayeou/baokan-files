Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council Holds
Workers' Painting Exhibition

[Beijing News] The touring exhibition of amateur workers' paintings, organized by the Cultural Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Propaganda and Education Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, opened on its first day (the 5th) in the auditorium of the Clothing Factory. The exhibits included more than 180 workers' paintings from nine factories, including the Clothing Factory, Changxindian Locomotive Factory, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Power Plant, 70th Ordnance Factory, and People's Printing Factory, as well as more than 30 photos from the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. Among them, the workers of the 70th Ordnance Factory created more than 50 works. Through various art forms such as cartoons, woodcuts, and comic strips, they reflected the lives of the workers and the active production of the workers; in addition, there were a small number of portraits of leaders and comic strips on preventing the plague. Among them, the image of Marx painted by Gao Zhenyu, a worker from the People's Printing Factory, Hong Xun's three woodcuts, the comic strips drawn by Han Jiaqi, a worker from the 70th Ordnance Factory, and Hong Jing's "Electric Welding" from the Xinhua Printing Factory, and Zhang Hongkui's "Steam Boiler" from the Shijingshan Power Plant are all extremely brilliant sketches. From these works, we can see the budding development of art activities in the factories and the vivid and rich content of workers' art creation.
