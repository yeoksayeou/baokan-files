　　Stalin—The Lenin of Today

　　Stalin is the genius leader and teacher of our Party, the great strategist of the socialist revolution, the leader and brilliant commander of the Soviet state. Utter ruthlessness towards the enemies of socialism, a profound spirit of principle, in work, both a clear revolutionary future and purpose, and a strong will to never stop until the goal is achieved; wise and concrete leadership; an inseparable connection with the masses—these are the characteristics of Stalin's work style. Apart from Lenin, there is no other leader in the world who has led such vast masses of workers and peasants as Stalin. Stalin is more skillful than anyone else in synthesizing the revolutionary creative experience of the masses, responding to and developing the pioneering spirit of the masses, learning from and teaching the masses, and guiding the masses to advance towards victory.

　　Stalin's entire activity shows that he has both great theoretical strength and an extraordinarily broad and magnificent practical revolutionary struggle experience.

　　Stalin, together with his close comrades-in-arms, long-tested Lenin's disciples, leads the great Bolshevik Party in leading this unprecedented multi-ethnic worker-peasant socialist country. His instructions are the guide to action in all sectors of socialist construction. Comrade Stalin's work is extraordinarily broad; his perseverance is truly astonishing. The problems Stalin is concerned with are truly all-encompassing: from the most complex theoretical problems of Marxism-Leninism to the compilation of children's textbooks; from handling Soviet foreign policy issues to daily attention to the construction of the proletarian capital; from establishing the Great Northern Sea Route to the drainage project of the Colchis Lowland; from the development of Soviet literature and art to the revision of the charter of collective farm life, and finally to solving the most complex theoretical and practical problems of military art.

　　Everyone knows that Stalin's logical power is invincible and indestructible; his mind is as clear as crystal, his will is as strong as steel, his loyalty to the Party is infinite, his trust in the people is profound, and his love and care are ardent. Everyone knows that Stalin is humble and frank, considerate to others, and ruthless to the enemies of the people. Everyone knows that Stalin is fundamentally opposed to exaggeration, empty talk, platitudes, retreating in the face of difficulties, and panicking when things happen. Stalin is always wise, calm, and unhurried whenever he needs to carefully estimate the pros and cons when solving complex political problems. At the same time, Stalin is also extremely skilled at planning bold revolutionary methods and implementing rapid transformation steps.

　　Stalin is the faithful successor to Lenin's cause, or as we often say in the Party, Stalin is the Lenin of today.

　　In 1929, in response to the congratulations from groups and comrades on his 50th birthday, Stalin wrote: "I regard your congratulatory messages as congratulations to the great working class party that gave birth to me and educated me in its own image... Comrades can rest assured that I am determined to dedicate all my strength, all my abilities, and if necessary, even all my blood, to the proletarian revolution and the cause of communism throughout the world in the future." (Note 1)

　　The peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union recognize Stalin as the embodiment of their heroic spirit, patriotic enthusiasm, and patriotic spirit. "Fight for Stalin! Fight for the Motherland!"—Soviet glorious soldiers shouted this slogan, crushed the extremely ferocious and insidious enemy, fascist Germany, and raised the flag of victory over Berlin.

　　"Fight for Stalin! Fight for the Motherland!"—Soviet naval warriors shouted this slogan, crushed imperialist Japan, and ensured the security of the Far Eastern border of the Soviet superpower.

　　The Soviet working class kept Stalin's name in their hearts, established unparalleled labor feats in the Great Patriotic War, and manufactured first-class weapons and ammunition to supply the Red Army.

　　The Soviet collective farmers kept Stalin's name in their hearts, worked hard in the fields, and produced grain to supply the Red Army and urban residents, and produced raw materials to supply the industry.

　　The Soviet intellectuals kept Stalin's name in their hearts, loyally served the cause of national defense, improved the Red Army's armaments, improved production technology and organization, and promoted Soviet science and culture.

　　The people of the Soviet Union kept Stalin's name in their hearts, effectively healed the wounds caused by the war, and strived for a more surging upsurge of the national economy and Soviet culture.

　　Stalin's name is a symbol of the Soviet people's courage and glory, and a clarion call to summon the Soviet people to establish new revolutionary achievements for the welfare of the great motherland.

　　Young men and women in socialist countries, male and female members of the children's corps, keep Stalin's name in their hearts at all times. Their most earnest desire is to become figures like Lenin, figures like Stalin, and Lenin-Stalin-style political activists. The Soviet youth responded to the Party's call, responded to Comrade Stalin's call, built many giant socialist enterprises, established city after city in the great forest zone, built and continued to build wonderful ships, strived for the Arctic region, mastered new technologies in industry and agriculture, consolidated our motherland's defense capabilities, worked hard in science and art, set an example of bravely killing the enemy on the battlefield of the Patriotic War, and set a model of striving to work hard behind the lines to ensure the victory of the Soviet army. The Communist Youth League, educated by Lenin and Stalin, is a faithful assistant of the Bolshevik Party and is worthy of being the successor of the older generation of communist fighters.

　　The peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union use various languages to compose songs praising Stalin. These songs reflect the Soviet people's great love and infinite loyalty to their great leader, teacher, friend, and commander.

　　In the people's creation, Stalin's name is integrated with Lenin's name. "We follow Stalin as we follow Lenin; we talk to Stalin as we talk to Lenin; he knows all our thoughts and intentions, and he cares about us throughout his life,"—as a very good Russian folk tale says.

　　Stalin's name is a symbol of the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society.

　　All progressive humanity, all freedom-loving democratic nations, place their hope for lasting peace and international security in Stalin.

　　"We are fortunate that in the difficult war years, we had our Soviet Union's wise and skilled leader, the great Stalin, leading the Red Army and the Soviet people forward. The glorious victory of our army will be recorded in the history of our country and the world together with the name of Marshal Stalin. Now, under the leadership of the great leader and organizer Stalin, we have started peaceful construction, with a view to achieving the ultimate prosperity of socialist society, and not disappointing the expectations of all our friends in the world."

　　斯大林——今日的列宁
    斯大林是我们党底天才领袖和导师，是社会主义革命底伟大战略家，是苏维埃国家领导者和英明统帅。对社会主义敌人毫不留情，极深刻的原则精神，在工作中，既有明确的革命前途和目的，又有非达到目的不止的坚强意志；贤明而具体的领导；同群众有不可分开的联系，——这就是斯大林工作作风底特点。除列宁而外，世界上再没有那个领袖，如斯大林领导过这样千千万万的广大工农群众。斯大林比谁都更巧于综合群众底革命创造经验，响应并发挥群众底首创精神，向群众学习并教导群众，引导群众向胜利前进。
    斯大林底全部活动，都表明他既有极大的理论力量，又有异常广阔宏伟的实际革命斗争经验。
    斯大林同他的亲近战友，久经锻炼的列宁信徒一起，率领着伟大的布尔塞维克党领导这亘古未有的多民族的工农社会主义国家。他的指示，是社会主义建设事业所有各个部门中的行动指南。斯大林同志底工作异常广阔；他的毅力真是惊人伟大。斯大林所关怀的问题真是包罗万象：从最复杂的马列主义理论问题，直至编制儿童教科书；从处决苏联对外政策问题，直至日常关注无产阶级首都建设事宜；从建立伟大北方海上航路问题，直至柯尔希达低原除湿工程；从苏联文学艺术发展问题，直至校订集体农场生活章程，最后还要解决军事艺术上最复杂的理论和实践问题。
    大家都知道，斯大林的逻辑力量是所向披靡，无坚不摧；他的头脑是如水晶般明亮，他的意志是如钢铁般坚强，他对党无限忠实，对人民深刻信任，热烈爱护。大家都知道，斯大林谦虚坦白，对人体贴入微，对人民公敌毫不留情。大家都知道，斯大林根本反对夸张，反对清谈，反对空话，反对见难而退，反对遇事张惶。斯大林每遇解决复杂政治问题，需要周密估计利弊所在的时候，总是明哲镇定，毫不急躁。同时，斯大林又是极其巧于规划大胆革命办法和实行急遽转变步骤的能手。
    斯大林是列宁事业底忠实继续者，或如我党内常说的那样，斯大林就是今天的列宁。
    一九二九年，斯大林在答谢那些祝他五十寿诞的团体和同志时写道：“我把你们的祝词贺电，当作是你们祝贺那个产生了我，并按其本身模样教养了我的伟大工人阶级党的祝词贺电……同志们尽可相信，我今后也决意把我的全部力量，把我的全部能力，必要时甚至把我的全部热血，献给无产阶级革命和全世界共产主义事业。”（注一）
    苏联各族人民认定斯大林是他们的英勇气概，爱国热情，爱国精神底化身。“为斯大林而战！为祖国而战！”——苏联光荣军人高呼着这一口号，粉碎了极凶恶、极阴毒的敌人法西斯德国，在柏林城上树起了胜利的旗帜。
    “为斯大林而战！为祖国而战！”——苏联击海军战士高呼着这一口号，粉碎了帝国主义日本，保障了苏维埃强国远东边界的安全。
    苏联工人阶级把斯大林底名字怀在心头，在伟大卫国战争中建立了无比的劳动勋功，制造出头等武器和弹药来供给了红军。
    苏联集体农民把斯大林底名字怀在心头，在田场上奋勇劳作，生产粮食来供给了红军和城市居民，生产原料来供给了工业。
    苏联知识分子把斯大林底名字怀在心头，忠诚服务国防事业，改进了红军底武装，改进了生产工作技术和组织，推进了苏联的科学和文化。
    苏联全国人民把斯大林底名字怀在心头，成效卓著地医治着战争所引起的创伤，并为国民经济和苏维埃文化更加澎湃高涨而奋斗。
    斯大林的名字是苏联人民义勇和光荣底象征，是召唤苏联民众去为伟大祖国福利建立新的革命功业的号角。
    社会主义国家中的青年男女，儿童团中的男女团员，时时刻刻把斯大林底名字怀在心里，他们最殷切的愿望，就是要成为列宁那样的人物，成为斯大林那样的人物，成为列宁斯大林式的政治活动家。苏联青年响应党底号召，响应斯大林同志底号召，建筑了许多巨型社会主义企业，在大森林地带创立了一座一座的城市，建造了并继续建造着奇妙的轮船，争取北极地带，精习工农业的新技术，巩固我们祖国国防能力，在科学和艺术方面努力创作，在卫国战争疆场上作出勇敢杀敌的榜样，在后方作出奋勇劳动保证苏联军队胜利的模范。列宁和斯大林所教养成的共产主义青年团，是布尔塞维克党底忠实助手，不愧为老辈共产主义战士底接班人。
    苏联各族人民用多种文字，编出歌颂斯大林的歌曲。在这些歌曲中间，反映出苏联各族人民对于他们这位伟大领袖，导师，友人和统帅的莫大爱感和无限忠心。
    在人民创作中，斯大林底名字与列宁底名字溶成一体。“我们跟着斯大林前进，犹如跟着列宁前进；我们同斯大林谈话，犹如同列宁谈话；他知道我们的全部心思和意向，他毕生关注着我们，”——一个极好的俄罗斯民间故事中这样说道。
    斯大林底名字，是苏维埃社会精神上政治上一致底象征。
    全体进步人类，一切爱好自由的民主国民，都把他们对永久和平与国际安全的希望寄托与斯大林。
    “我们幸运的地方，就是在艰苦的战争年代，有我们苏联底英明谙练领袖伟大斯大林引导红军和苏联人民前进。我们军队底光荣胜利，将与斯大林元帅底名字连在一起载入我国和全世界的史册。现在，我们在伟大的领袖和组织者斯大林领导下，已经着手进行和平建设，以期社会主义社会臻于极盛境地，而不辜负全世界上所有一切友人对于我们的厚望。”（注二）
