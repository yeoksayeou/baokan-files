The team has been dispatched to Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Longyan and other places. In addition, a youth work team has been assigned to major factories in Fuzhou to carry out youth work in a step-by-step and focused manner. It also plans to organize rural work teams to go to the countryside to cooperate with rural districts and townships in mobilizing farmers to carry out rent reduction and other work. It will also discover and cultivate activists from various mass movements and recruit them into the League. At the same time, it will create experience in practical work and promote league building in rural areas throughout the province.
