　　Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce
    Calls on Industrial and Commercial Circles to Purchase Public Bonds
    Making Every Effort to Create Favorable Conditions for Economic Construction
    [Beijing News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce held a plenary meeting of all committee members at 9:00 AM on the 13th and decided to call on industrial and commercial figures in the capital to support the government's issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds, and to mobilize industrial and commercial figures to actively purchase them, making it a movement. To this end, the committee issued a letter to industrial and commercial figures in the capital, the full text of which is as follows:
    The fourth meeting of our Central People's Government Committee passed the 1950 National Government Revenue and Expenditure Budget and the decision on issuing Victory Indexed Public Bonds. Regarding this decision, as its name suggests, it is a historic decision necessitated by the people's victory in the process of winning the People's Liberation Revolutionary War nationwide, and it is also a wise measure to overcome the national financial difficulties in 1950, improve the national financial situation, and stabilize prices to create favorable conditions for economic construction.
    Our fellow male and female comrades in the industrial and commercial circles of the capital should deeply understand that the Victory Indexed Public Bonds are savings taken from the people and used for national construction, so that the people do not suffer the slightest loss, and the purpose of economic prosperity is achieved. This is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang bandit gang's indiscriminate issuance of public bonds. The Kuomintang bandit gang issued public bonds to exploit the people and expand the power of the four major families in order to rule the people, while our People's Government issues public bonds to eliminate remnants of the enemy, consolidate national defense, restore production, and prosper the economy. Moreover, we should know that everyone is responsible for national construction, let alone the fact that the state is borrowing money from us for construction! And what's more, the methods are carefully considered in every aspect! The amount issued is not large, and it is calculated in real terms, with interest and guarantees, and the principal and interest can be paid off within five years. Therefore, we should firmly believe that the public bonds issued by the government are significant and have solid credit. Not only will this not cause us any losses, but it will also be very beneficial to the people of the whole country and to our entire industrial and commercial community in all aspects, directly and indirectly.
    Our Central People's Government is composed of the "four classes." The farmers have shouldered a very heavy burden in the long revolutionary process, and it has not yet been lightened. The workers are the most active and have the most arduous tasks in the revolution and construction. Now our industrial and commercial compatriots should do our part in this "victory of difficulty, victory of burden."
    Therefore, we call on everyone to unite and resolutely support the Central People's Government's decision to issue the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds. Our industrial and commercial circles should actively purchase them and promote them into a subscription movement, and faithfully and responsibly guarantee its success.

　　北京市工商联合会筹备委员会
    号召工商业界购买公债
    尽力为经济建设造成有利条件
    【北京讯】北京市工商联合会筹备委员会十三日上午九时举行全体委员会议，决定号召首都工商业者拥护政府发行人民胜利折实公债，并发动工商业者踊跃购买，使它成为一个运动。为此，该会特发表一告首都工商业者书，全文如下：
    我们的中央人民政府委员会第四次会议通过一九五○年度全国政府收支概算和关于发行胜利折实公债的决定，对于这一个决定正如其名称表示的，是一个争取人民解放革命战争在全国空前胜利过程中的、历史性的、人民胜利需要的一个决定，同时是克服一九五○年度国家财政困难与改善国家财政状况、稳定物价以造成经济建设有利条件的贤明措施。
    我们首都工商业界的男女同志们应深切明了胜利折实公债是取之于民的储蓄，用之于国家建设，使人民不蒙受丝毫损失，达到繁荣经济的目的，这是和国民党匪帮滥发公债的本质和意义绝不相同。国民党匪帮发行公债是剥削人民用以扩张四大家族的势力而来统治人民的，而我们人民政府的发行公债是用来肃清残敌巩固国防恢复生产和繁荣经济的。而且我们更应知道国家建设人人有责，何况国家借我们的钱用于建设呢！又何况在办法上处处设想很周到呢！发行数量并不多，而且折实计算，有利息，有保障，五年内本利就可清偿，所以我们应坚决相信政府所发的公债是意义重大、信用巩固的公债，这不但对我们毫无亏损，直接间接地各方面都是对全国人民对我们全体工商业界是非常有利的。
    我们的中央人民政府是我们“四个阶级”成份所组成的。农民们在长期革命过程中担负已是非常重了，现在还未减轻，工人们在革命及建设中是最积极而任务最艰辛的，现在我们工商业界的同胞们是应该在这“胜利的困难、胜利的负担”中来尽一份我们的力量。
    所以我们向大家号召：一致起来坚决拥护和支持中央人民政府关于发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，我们工商业界应踊跃购买而且要把它推广成为一个认购的运动，并忠诚负责的保证其成功。
