　　The performance of the new Ping Opera "Nine-Tailed Fox" is a success. Its achievements are not limited to the stage.

　　It undoubtedly had a tremendous educational impact on the audience. It exposed the crimes of the landlord class; and it explained that these crimes were possible because the landlords had long exploited the peasants and thus had money and power; these crimes are rooted in exploitation and are inseparable from exploitation. To take a detail as an example, if it were not for the wealthy landlords building such deep and large houses, could there be such a secret suite of rooms that outsiders could not approach, first hiding the child Stone, then hiding the maid Xiaojuan, and then hiding the tenant Shuanzi? Every night, when "Nine-Tailed Fox" was performed in the second half, the audience's reaction was always so strong, always so angry and hateful towards the landlords and lackeys, and insisting on not forgiving them. We can believe that the citizens of Beijing were convinced by this play.

　　Secondly, it undoubtedly also educated some of the workers engaged in performing this play in three aspects: First, this is truly a vivid political education. I think that before and after performing this play, everyone's understanding of feudal landlords must be profoundly different, and everyone's class consciousness must be appropriately improved. That is a certainty. Second, this performance stabilized and strengthened everyone's confidence in reforming old operas. There is no need to shy away from the fact that many old artists harbor a question in their hearts: the content of reformed operas has been reformed, but because the city audience is accustomed to the original "gadgets" of old operas, will the "box office value" be relatively inferior? Here is a clear answer: the city audience will support reformed operas (the box office of Nine-Tailed Fox exceeded that of old Ping operas), if it is indeed performed wonderfully. Third, in terms of business, this also points out the path of "how to make reformed operas wonderfully". That is, workers must enthusiastically and diligently study new scripts, work hard to use their own work experience and originally mastered skills to engage in rehearsals and creation. They should not give up their inherent talents, they should not disarm their theatrical equipment, and only rely on the content of reformed operas to "attract audiences" for everyone. It is absolutely forbidden to be lazy and opportunistic, because "Nine-Tailed Fox" is not only good in content, but also greatly improved in performance. Everyone who participated in the performance will remember this.

　　Again, this performance also educated those of us who are enthusiastic about reforming old operas. To be honest, without true political awareness, old artists may not have a true desire to reform. Even if they shout for reform, it is inevitably "to follow the trend." When learning "Si Lang Visits His Mother," "The Drunken Concubine," "Shi Qian Steals a Chicken," and other operas, they may spend three months to three years of hard work in order to excel in their performance. But when learning a sentence of a reformed opera, they are only willing to spend three to five days, and thirty days is considered too much. They hope that the content of reformed operas can guarantee their personal success, and they personally do not have to spend too much effort. Since they harbor the idea of gaining something for nothing to some extent, and those of us who urge them to carry out reforms often focus on the content of the play, thinking that since the content of the play is very good, it will naturally be supported by the audience. As for how to perform the play well, we rely on the contribution of the actors; or even when writing the script, we do not care about the actors' hardships, nor do we arrange opportunities for workers to "grow" and "create." As a result, the content of the play may be good, but the performance is really not wonderful! Who should be responsible for this failure! From the success of "Nine-Tailed Fox," we can understand: they artists certainly need to work hard to learn, and those of us "outsiders" or "semi-outsiders" who are enthusiastic about reform need to work even harder to learn - so that the scripts we write and the opinions we put forward can meet their requirements, solve their difficulties, and give play to their talents; if it is said to be "leadership," it must be leadership in both content and technology, otherwise we must share the responsibility for failure.

　　（二）

　　I personally feel that the achievements of "Nine-Tailed Fox" this time are due to the following reasons.

　　First, the training class played a role. The enthusiasm of the staff of the Zaiwen Society is admirable. Several activists took the lead and mobilized all the staff. Due to their political awareness and their hatred for the landlord class, they absolutely "believe in the truth of this story," as Stanislavski said. At this moment, they all sincerely have the desire to reform old operas, and not for the sake of reform, not for the sake of attracting audiences, but to believe that they have the ability and qualifications to serve the people with Ping Opera, and to reform in order to serve the people. Glory should belong to the training class.

　　Second, the supply of scripts and assistance in rehearsals by several workers of the Opera Improvement Bureau are also indispensable reasons for this success. This theme, this story, this subject, these characters are very suitable for the staff of the Zaiwen Society. Their political awareness, their life experience, their stage skills can be unified with the requirements of the script. Therefore, the performance is particularly competent and pleasant. This cannot but be attributed to the proper judgment and selection of the assistants.

　　Third, the various treatments in the performance can make good use of the strengths of local operas. Local operas come from the countryside. Before they came to the city, they had no opportunity to learn from other, more technically advanced operas such as Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera; therefore, everything about local operas can only learn from real life and imitate the clothing, food, housing, and transportation in real life. For example, drinking, eating, whipping, and paddling, it uses real cups, bowls, whips, and paddles, and the actions of the performance are essentially imitations of the actions of real life; sometimes they can be simplified, but they always do not deviate from imitation. Also, like climbing stairs and opening doors, there are no stairs or doors on the stage, but the actions of "climbing" and "opening" are still imitations of reality. In "Nine-Tailed Fox," Xiaojuan is tied and hung, and real ropes are not used on the stage, and coffins are carried, and real coffins are not used on the stage, but the actions of "tying and hanging" and "carrying" are still imitations of reality. This is exactly its advantage, and there is no so-called "symbolism" and disharmony.——(The most disharmonious is Peking Opera; Peking Opera can be said to be a collection of local operas; there are many simplified and unsimplified (such as eating bean juice in "@銮禧") imitation actions in Peking Opera, but the facial makeup in the opera is somewhat symbolic. Moreover, because Zhang Fei's name is "Fei," a "Fei" shape that looks like a butterfly or a bat is painted on his face, and because Wushu's country is called "Jin," the face must be painted with "Jin"—see Xu's "History of Chinese Drama"—that kind of "symbolism" is really laughable.)

　　Finally, I have to mention the actors' sincere and forceful but also quite restrained acting skills in "Nine-Tailed Fox"; Nine-Tailed Fox, Xiaojuan, Shuanzi's wife, and the two lackeys all give the audience a sense of reality. And Li Zaiwen has been able to achieve the word "just right" of "just right", without using less effort, nor using more effort - the role of Nine-Tailed Fox is not easy to handle; if you use less effort, the audience may feel that it is not enough, and if you use more effort, the audience will feel that it is too much and unbelievable. Among professional actors of any genre in the old opera world in Beijing today, there may not be many who can surpass her in terms of acting skills. As for Shuanzi, it is appropriate to assign the role. As soon as he appears on the stage, you can see that he is an honest and useless person tortured by feudal exploitation and oppression. If Shuanzi were replaced by Lao Qi, he would never be willing to be hidden for seventeen years.

　　（三）

　　In two places, the handling may seem to be somewhat different.

　　One is the scene of the landlord collecting rent in the play. I think this scene should be treated as a "main scene"—the so-called "main scene" is the scene that is most effective in developing the theme. Here, Nine-Tailed Fox's ruthlessness towards the tenants who owe rent is not as blatant as her other ruthlessness—she does not need to say much, and there is an unparalleled threat invisibly; here, Nine-Tailed Fox's crimes are not as easy to arouse the hatred and hatred of the city audience as her other crimes; but the ruthlessness and crimes here are the basic class of the landlord, and make her other ruthlessness and crimes possible. This scene should be used to emphasize that if the landlord does not exploit, he will not be so rich, he will not be so powerful, and he will not be able to harm people so cruelly with money and power. The lines should be increased, the events should be strengthened, and I think there is this need here.

　　The other place is in the second half of the play—after Zhu Gongbo has been liberated, would landlords like Nine-Tailed Fox not resort to conspiracies for their own exploitation interests? And these conspiracies may be the culmination of all her past crimes. When the play is performed here, the audience has long been resentful of Nine-Tailed Fox. Her attempt to poison Shuanzi has made the audience unwilling to sit idly by. And if her conspiracy is more political, attempting to poison not just one person but her former tenants, wouldn't the necessity of eliminating the landlord class be developed more clearly and powerfully? According to Nine-Tailed Fox's life, if she does not struggle and conspire for the rights of the landlord at this time, the audience will feel a little surprised. Generally speaking, this does not seem to be Nine-Tailed Fox's character. So I think there is a need to "explore" and add a scene here—on the one hand, it is in line with reality, and on the other hand, it can be more complete in the development of the play, and no longer give people the feeling that the second half is slightly simple.

　　Because I heard that Mr. Ma Shaobo is preparing to reorganize "Nine-Tailed Fox" again, I put forward the above two suggestions.

　　（四）

　　The achievements of "Nine-Tailed Fox" have given many people great encouragement. At the same time, it once again proves that no matter how good the content of the play is, without a performance that makes good use of skills, the content of the play will not reach the audience.

　　新评戏“九尾狐”的成就
    洪深
　　（一）
    “九尾狐”的演出是成功的。它的成就，不仅限于在舞台上。
    它无疑地对于观众发生了巨大的教育影响。它暴露了地主阶级的罪恶；而且说明，这些罪恶，由于地主的长久剥削农民因而有钱有势而才有可能的；这些罪恶，根源于剥削，并且与剥削不可分的。举一细节为例，假如不是有钱的大地主造起那样深大的房屋，可能有那么一个外人走不近的，先藏小孩石头再藏婢女小娟，又藏佃户栓子的密室套间么？每晚的观众在“九尾狐”演到后半节的时候，反应总是那么强烈，总是那么愤怒地仇恨地对于地主和走狗坚持不饶赦的态度，我们可以相信，北京的市民观众，是被这个戏说服了的。
    次之，它无疑地也教育了从事演出这个戏的一些工作者，在三个方面：第一、这真是活生生的政治教育。我想，在未演此戏之前，与既演此戏之后，大家对于封建地主的认识必有深刻的不同，各人的阶级觉悟必有适当的提高，那是可以断言的。第二、这次演出，稳定了并且坚强了大家的改革旧戏的信心。毋庸讳言，不少旧艺人内心怀着一个疑问：改革戏的内容是改革了，但由于市民观众习惯于原有旧戏的那些“玩意”，是否“票房价值”会得相形见拙？这里给了明白答复：市民观众会得拥护改革戏的（演九尾狐的卖座就超过演旧评戏），如果的确是演得精彩的话。第三、在业务方面，这里也指出“如何可以把改革戏演得有精彩”的道路。那就是工作者须要热情努力的学习新的本子，刻苦用功的运用自己的工作经验和原已掌握的技巧，以从事排练与创作。不应放弃自己本有的才能，不应解除自己的戏剧武装，而仅仅依赖改革戏的内容来替大家“叫座”，更绝对不可偷懒取巧，因为“九尾狐”不仅是内容好，在演出上也是大大的加了工的，凡是参加演出的人都会记住这一点。
    再次，这个演出也教育了我们这些热心于改革旧戏的人们。老实说，没有真正的政治觉悟，旧艺人未必有真正要求改革的热情。即使高呼改革，难免不是“趋时”。他在学习“四郎探母”、“贵妃醉酒”、“时迁偷鸡”等戏的时候，为要在成绩上出人头地，可能用上三个月到三年的苦功。但他学习一句改革戏，只愿化费三五天的时间，三十天就觉得是太多。他希望改革戏的内容可以保证他个人的成功，他个人可以不须太大的费力。他既然多少存着不劳而获的思想，而我们这些敦促他们进行改革的人，也往往偏重于戏的内容，以为戏的内容既然很好，自然能得观众拥护，至于如何把戏演好，却仰仗于演员的贡献；甚或在执笔写剧时，毫不理会演员的甘苦，也不曾安排下工作者“见长”和“创造”的机会，结果是戏的内容可能是好的，而演出实在没有精彩！这个失败的责任究应归谁负呢！从“九尾狐”的成功，我们可以晓得：他们艺人固然须要苦功学习，而我们热心改革的“外行”或“半外行”更须要苦功学习——务使写出的本子和提出的意见，能满足他们的要求，解答他们的困难；发挥他们的才能；如果说是“领导”的话，在内容上和在技术上都得领导，否则就要分担失败的责任的。
　　（二）
    “九尾狐”这次的成就，我个人感觉是由于下列诸原因。
    第一，这是讲习班发生了作用。再雯社工作人员的热情是可惊佩的。几位积极分子带头，动员了全体人员。由于他们的政治觉悟，和对地主阶级的仇恨，他们绝对“相信这个故事的真理”，如司坦尼斯拉夫斯基所说的。在此刻，他们都真诚地有了改革旧戏的要求，而且不是为了改革而改革，不是为了叫座而改革，而是信任自己有能力有资格以评戏为人民服务，为了服务人民而要改革。光荣应当是属于讲习班的。
    第二，戏曲改进局的几位工作者的供给剧本与协助排演，也是这次成功不可缺少的原因。这个题材，这个故事，这个主题，这些人物，十分适合于再雯社的工作人员。他们的政治觉悟，他们的生活经验，他们的舞台技能，都能和剧本的要求统一。因此演来是特别的胜任愉快。这个不能不归功于协助者的判断与选择的得当。
    第三，演出上的种种处理，甚能善用地方戏的所长。地方戏来自乡间，在它未到都市的时候，没有机会向别的技术较高的戏如京戏如昆曲等学习；因此地方戏的一切，只可向真实人生学习，模仿实际生活中的衣食住行。例如饮酒，吃饭，挥鞭，打桨，它就用真的杯碗鞭桨，而表演的动作，本质上是模仿实际生活的动作；有时可以简化，但始终不脱模仿。又如登楼，开门之类，台上无梯亦无门，但“登”与“开”的动作，还是模仿实际的。“九尾狐”中捆吊小娟，台上未用真绳，扛抬棺木，台上未用真棺，但“捆吊”与“扛抬”的动作，仍是模仿实际的。这正是它的好处，并无所谓“象征”与不调和。——（最不调和的还是京戏；京戏原可说是集地方戏的大成的；京戏中那简化的和不简化的（如“＠銮禧”中的吃豆汁）的模仿动作多得很，独有戏中的脸谱多少有些是象征。而且因为张飞名“飞”，脸上即画一亦似蝴蝶亦似蝙蝠的“飞”形，又因兀术国号“金”，勾脸即须上“金”——见徐著“中国戏剧史”——那样的“象征”，真可大发一噱了。）
    最后，不能不一提“九尾狐”中演员们诚恳的用力的但亦颇有节制的演技；九尾狐、小娟、栓子嫂、和两个狗腿等，无不给观众以真实感。而李再雯君已能做到“恰到好处”的“恰”字，没有少用气力，也没有多用气力——九尾狐这个角色，不易处理；少用一分气力，观众可能觉得不够味，而如多用一分气力，观众又会觉得过火而不可信的。在今日北京旧剧界的任何剧种的职业演员中，演技方面能超过她的，恐怕真不太多。至于栓子，是派角得当，他一上场，就可看出他是一个为封建的剥削和压迫所折磨成的老实无用的人，倘如栓子换上老七，便决不会甘心被藏十七年。
　　（三）
    在两个地方，处理上似乎可以有些不同。
    一是剧中地主收租的一场。这一场，我认为应作“主场戏”处理——所谓“主场”是发挥主题最为得力的一场。这里，九尾狐对于欠租佃户的狠毒，尽管不如她的其他狠毒同样露骨——她无须多言，而无形中自有无上的威胁；这里，九尾狐的罪恶，尽管不如她的别种罪恶来得容易激动市民观众的憎恶与仇恨；但是这里的狠毒与罪恶，乃是地主的阶级的基本的，是使得她的其他狠毒与罪恶有可能的。这一场戏，应可用来强调说明，地主不剥削，就不会那样有钱，也就不会那样有势，也就不能仗着钱势那样残酷地害人。台词应可增加，事件应可强化，我觉得这里有这个必要。
    另一处在戏的后半节——朱公泊既经解放之后，象九尾狐那样的地主，为了自己的剥削利益，会不施展阴谋么？而这些阴谋，可能是她已往一切罪恶的顶点。戏演到这里，观众早已对九尾狐痛恨。她的企图毒死栓子，已使观众不甘坐视。而倘如她的阴谋是更有政治性的，企图毒害不只一人而是她的从前的佃户们的，那么地主阶级的必须消灭，岂不发挥得更清楚更有力。按照九尾狐的一生，在此时她不为地主的权利而挣扎而进行阴谋，观众会多少觉得有点意外。就一般情理来讲，这似乎不象九尾狐的为人。所以我以为这里须要“发掘”和增加一场戏——一方面是符合现实的，另方面在戏的发展上亦可更为完整，不再给人以后半稍嫌简略之感。
    因闻马少波先生正在准备将“九尾狐”再作一度的整理，所以提出两点如上的意见。
　　（四）
    “九尾狐”的成就，给予很多人很大的鼓励。同时也再一次证明——无论戏本内容如何好，没有一个善用技巧的演出，戏的内容到达不了观众的。
