Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th: The autumn plowing work in North China provinces has generally concluded in November, and they have successively shifted to winter production.

Shanxi Province has completed autumn plowing on 20 million mu of land. In general, the old areas have cultivated 85% of the arable land, an increase of 12% compared to last year; the new areas have cultivated 45% of the arable land. In Chahar Province, north Chahar reached 70%, Yanbei reached 80%, and south Chahar reached 91%, all exceeding the original plans. In Suiyuan Province, the eastern Suiyuan area had cultivated 88% of the arable land before the Beginning of Winter (Lidong), with individual counties completing 90%. As of October 25th, Hebei Province had completed 70% of its autumn plowing. In late November, Xingtai, Handan, and other special districts in the province also conducted a comprehensive autumn plowing inspection, forming autumn plowing shock teams based on the unfinished situations in various regions, repeatedly carrying out propaganda and mobilization, adjusting livestock, and resolving practical difficulties in autumn plowing. Currently, with the exception of a few disaster areas, a general plowing can be carried out once. In the plains, excluding disaster areas, 80% of the autumn plowing has been completed.

On the basis of the general completion of autumn plowing, all provinces have organized winter production, focusing on manure accumulation, firewood gathering, and canal construction, actively preparing for next year's production campaign. Xin County, Yuci, and other places in Shanxi Province have focused on canal construction. The people's governments of the counties along the Fen River in central Shanxi Province have organized over 10,000 farmers to accelerate the construction of water conservancy projects, diverting water for irrigation. In terms of manure accumulation, statistics for only half a month from November 1st to 15th show that the province accumulated 12 million dan of fertilizer. The Hebei Provincial People's Government has also mobilized farmers to dig wells, repair canals, accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, and increase purchases of agricultural tools to prepare for next year's production. Handan, Xingtai, Dingxian, and other special districts organized the masses to dig wells before the freeze and purchased waterwheels. Handan Special District plans to dig 10,000 wells by next year, irrigating 200,000 mu of land; Cheng'an County strives to dig 1,300 wells before next year's wheat harvest.

While organizing agricultural production preparation work, all provinces have focused on organizing farmers to engage in handicrafts and sideline production. In coordination with winter production, Chahar Province plans to develop 1,000 truly effective rural supply and marketing cooperatives. Governments at all levels in Suiyuan Province vigorously organized mass transportation by farmers and supported various types of handicrafts and sideline production. In order to support farmers in carrying out winter production, the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued a total of 2.717 billion yuan in loans for fisheries, livestock, oil pressing, textiles, and general sideline production, according to the specific needs of disaster and non-disaster areas. It also organized various handicraft production activities such as oil pressing, flour mills, transportation, mat weaving, and cloth weaving, based on different local conditions. Supply and marketing cooperatives have played a significant organizational role in this regard, not only helping to supply raw materials and promote finished products, but also helping disaster areas exchange for over 10 million jin of grain. In order to specifically organize urban and rural material exchanges and develop transportation, Shanxi Province organized the repair of roads. In addition, Changzhi, Yuci, Yicheng and other special districts, based on the new urban-rural relationship and their respective different conditions, have formulated specific plans for the development of iron industry, oil pressing, and weaving. In Pingyuan Province, Xiuwu County restored all of the county's brick kiln industry to prepare for next year's well-digging work; sideline production in Ye County has also been widely developed, and the flower workshop and flour milling industries have been largely restored.

In addition, the three provinces of Chahar, Shanxi, and Hebei, in conjunction with the deployment of winter production, have universally carried out mass production summary movements. The development of this movement has not only directly strengthened the leadership of this winter's production movement and greatly improved farmers' scientific and technical level, but also further increased farmers' confidence in increasing production, laying a good foundation for next year's production movement. In most areas of Shanxi Province, the production summary was first carried out by the rural branches of the Chinese Communist Party. Within the branch, a four-comparison movement was carried out, comparing mutual aid, farming techniques, experience, and harvests, absorbing non-Party production activists to participate, and then promoted it into a village-wide movement. Chahar Province combined the autumn plowing summary and carried out a prize evaluation, rewarding those who had made achievements in leading production, so that good leadership methods could be promoted and universalized.

　　十一月份华北农情
    【新华社北京十日电】十一月份华北各省秋耕工作大体结束，相继转入冬季生产。
    山西省已有两千万亩土地完成秋耕。一般的老区已耕地达可耕地百分之八十五，比去年增加百分之十二；新区达可耕地的百分之四十五。察哈尔省察北达百分之七十，雁北达百分之八十，察南达百分之九十一，都超过原订计划。绥远省绥东地区在立冬前已耕地达可耕地百分之八十八，个别县已完成百分之九十。河北省截至十月二十五日止，全省秋耕即已完成百分之七十。十一月下旬，该省邢台、邯郸等专区又先后普遍进行了秋耕大检查，根据各地未完成情况组成秋耕突击组，反复进行宣传动员，调剂了牲畜、解决了秋耕中的实际困难。目前，除少数灾区外，大体可普耕一遍。平原全省除灾区外，秋耕完成百分之八十。
    在秋耕大体结束的基础上，各省均以积肥、打柴、修渠为中心，组织了冬季生产，积极为明年的生产运动作准备。山西省忻县、榆次等地均以修渠为重点，该省中部沿汾河两岸各县人民政府并组织了万余农民，加紧赶修水利工程，引水浇地。在积肥方面，仅十一月一日至十五日半月统计，全省即积肥一千二百万担。河北省人民政府亦发动农民打井修渠，大量积肥，增购农具，准备明年生产。邯郸、邢台、定县等专区在封冻前组织群众打井，并购置水车。邯郸专区计划到明年打井一万眼，浇地二十万亩；成安县争取到明年麦收前，打井一千三百眼。
    与组织农业生产准备工作的同时，各省都着重地组织农民进行手工业和副业生产。察哈尔省配合冬季生产，计划发展一千个真正起作用的农村供销社。绥远省各级政府大力组织农民群众性的运输，并扶植了各种各样的手工业和副业生产。河北省人民政府为扶植农民开展冬季生产，根据灾区和非灾区具体需要，发放渔业、牲口、榨油、纺织及一般副业贷款等共二十七亿一千七百万元，并依据各地不同情况，组织榨油、粉坊、运输、编席、织布等各种手工业生产。供销合作社在这方面起了极大的组织作用，除帮助供给原料推销成品外，并帮助灾区换回粮食千余万斤。山西省为具体组织城乡物资交流，发展运输，组织了大路和车路修复工作。此外，长治、榆次、翼城等专区，并依据新的城乡关系，与各自不同情况，订出发展铁业、榨油、编织的具体计划。平原省修武县恢复了该县全部砖窑业，为明年的打井工作做准备；邺县副业生产亦普遍开展，花坊、粉坊业已大部恢复。
    此外，察哈尔、山西、河北三省，结合布置冬季生产，普遍开展了群众性的生产总结运动。这一运动的开展，不仅直接加强了今冬的生产运动的领导，大大提高了农民的科学和技术水平，而且进一步提高了农民增产的信心，给明年的生产运动准备了良好的基础。生产总结在山西省的多数地区是先由中共农村支部进行的，在支部内开展比互助、比耕作技术、比经验、比收成的四比运动，吸收非党的生产积极分子参加，而后推广成为全村的运动。察哈尔省则结合秋耕总结，开展了评奖工作，对于领导生产有成绩的进行了奖励，使好的领导方法得以推广和普遍化。
