　　Chairman Mao is Victory
    Li Da
    A few days ago, this newspaper published letters to Chairman Mao from the 510,000 people of Lushun-Dalian and all the fishermen of Maoedao Island in Shandong. These two letters are full of enthusiasm and profound meaning, fully demonstrating the people's gratitude and thanks to their leader. They also appropriately illustrate the real relationship between the people's leader and the broad masses of the people. As the people of Lushun-Dalian said to Chairman Mao in their letter: "You come from the people, lead the people, you have mountain-like great kindness to the people, and the people have ocean-like deep love for you." This is a hymn, and also a reliance. It has become an invincible material force, guaranteeing to break through all obstacles and difficulties, and build a beautiful and happy people's motherland.
    All the people of China have suffered the same fate as the people of Lushun-Dalian and the people of Maoedao Island. They have also received the same personal experiences. Under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, who can survive! Thus, a life-and-death struggle unfolded. People saw Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's "bright red flag," and had hope and confidence; with this red flag guiding them forward, they achieved true victory. The people of Lushun-Dalian, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Soviet Red Army, drove away the Japanese after decades of struggle. After only four years of hard work in construction, they have "gone from backwardness to progress, from poverty to prosperity." Similarly, the people of Maoedao Island, under the leadership of the Party, defeated the Japanese and Chiang bandits, abolished the feudal system, and responded to Chairman Mao's call to implement the second organization, giving the whole island a new look and gradually enriching the people's lives.
    Ironclad facts have educated our people: Chairman Mao is victory. Following Chairman Mao always leads to success. Decades of history have proven this truth, and personal experience has deeply rooted this truth in the hearts of the people of the whole country. Now, the Central People's Government has been established, and Chairman Mao has called for transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, launching a high tide of economic construction and cultural construction. The war is nearing its end, and the remaining task is construction. The experiences of Lushun-Dalian, Maoedao Island, and all liberated areas have proven that implementing the "from all directions" policy stipulated by Chairman Mao and implementing the second "organization" can gradually and rapidly transform backwardness into progress, and poverty into prosperity. The facts of Lushun-Dalian and Maoedao Island provide a powerful example for the people of the whole country.

　　毛主席就是胜利
    李大
    前两天本报发表了旅大五十一万人民和山东镆＠岛全体渔民写给毛主席的信。这两封信热情横溢，意味深浓，充分地表现了人民对于自己的领袖的感激和谢意。也恰当地说明了人民的领袖和广大人民之间的真实关系。正如旅大人民在信上对毛主席所说的：“您来自人民，领导人民，您对人民有着山岳般的重大的恩情，人民对您也有着海洋般的深厚的爱戴。”这是赞歌，也是依赖，它已经成为无敌的物质力量，保证打破一切障碍和困难，建设一个美好幸福的人民祖国。
    全中国的人民都遭受旅大人民和镆＠岛人民同样的命运。也都领受了他们相同的切身经验。在帝国主义、封建主义，官僚资本主义压迫、剥削之下，谁能活下去呀！于是，生死攸关的斗争展开了。人们看到毛主席、共产党“这幅鲜明的红旗”，有了希望和信心；有这幅红旗引导下前进，结果获得了真正的胜利。旅大人民在党的领导下奋斗了几十年，得到苏联红军的帮助，赶跑了日本。经过短短的四年的努力建设，已经“从落后走向进步，从贫困走向繁荣”。镆＠岛的人民同样在党的领导下，打败了日本和蒋匪，取消了封建制度，又响应毛主席的号召，实行第二个组织起来，全岛面貌一新，人民生活逐渐富裕。
    铁一样的事实教育了我国人民：毛主席就是胜利，跟着毛主席走，永远是成功的。几十年的历史说明了这个真理，切身经验已从事锭个真理深入于全国人民的心坎中。现在，中央人民政府已经成立，毛主席号召把农业国变为工业国，开展一个经济建设和文化建设的高潮。战争已近结束，剩下的事情就是建设了。旅大、镆＠岛和所有解放区的经验都已证明，执行毛主席规定的“四面八方”政策，实行第二个“组织起来”，就能够逐步而又迅速地变落后为进步，易贫困为繁荣。旅大和镆＠岛的事实，给全国人民提供了一个有力的榜样。
