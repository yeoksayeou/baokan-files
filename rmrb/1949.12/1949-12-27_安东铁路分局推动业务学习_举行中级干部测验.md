　　[Northeast News] The Andong Railway Bureau is using professional oral tests to promote professional study among all middle-level cadres of the bureau. Starting from the 3rd of this month, a total of 154 cadres at the section chief and director levels from various stations and sections have been selected and tested in batches over five days. The results of the test showed that 61 people scored 60 or above, accounting for 40 percent of the total number of test takers, while 93 people scored below 60, accounting for 60 percent of the total number. Generally speaking, the results of this test were not very good. A considerable number of cadres did poorly, failing to answer even the simplest and most common knowledge of their own departments. After each batch of tests, the director of the bureau would commend those who did well, encouraging them not to be arrogant or complacent, to continue to study hard, and to help others learn. Those who did poorly were criticized to encourage them to overcome their reluctance to study, to work harder, and to learn with an open mind, striving for good results in the second test.

　　安东铁路分局推动业务学习
　  举行中级干部测验
    【东北讯】安东铁路分局采用业务口试测验方法，推动分局全体中级干部的业务学习。自本月三日起，先后共抽调各站段股长、主任级干部共一百五十四人，以五天时间分批测验完毕。测验结果，在六十分以上的有六十一人，占参加测验人数的百分之四十，六十分以下的有九十三人，占全人数的百分之六十。总的说来，这次测验的成绩是不怎么好的，有相当一部分干部考得很糟，连本部门最简单最普通的常识都答不出来。在每考完一批之后，对考得好的，分局长即加以表扬，勉以不要骄傲自满，继续努力学习，并帮助别人学习；对考得不好的，予以批评，以勉克服不愿学习的思想，加紧努力，虚心学习，争取第二次考试时能有好的成绩。
