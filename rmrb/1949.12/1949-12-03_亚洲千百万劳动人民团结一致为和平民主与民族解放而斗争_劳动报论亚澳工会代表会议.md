Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 30th (TASS): Labor Daily recently published an article by Davydov on the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, stating that the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) has become a decisive force in the world labor movement. The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, is a significant testament to the growing strength and reputation of the WFTU.

Davydov pointed out that young trade unions in Asian countries are becoming genuine, militant mass organizations and the most important detachment in the national liberation struggle. Although the situations and working conditions vary, trade unions in Asia and Australia have found common ground and reached a consensus in Beijing, which is extremely necessary for the working people of colonial and dependent countries and for the working class around the world. The Beijing Representative Conference demonstrates the will of millions of working people in Asian countries to unite and join workers around the world in the struggle for peace and democracy. This conference dealt a fatal blow to the divisive plans of reactionary trade union leaders in the United States and Britain, and to the imperialists’ running dogs in the trade union movement—the various Greens, Mollets, Galaes, and Deakins. Davydov emphasized that this traitorous group had exhausted all efforts to split the Asian trade union movement. The splitters aided the British, French, and Dutch colonial authorities. American monopoly capitalists lavishly subsidized them. Local bourgeois police and all forms of terror were used to crush trade unions. However, they could not paralyze the working class's struggle for unity. The plan to establish a reactionary "Asian Trade Union Federation" was shattered. Only in some countries (India, Iran) could the splitters establish despicable police organizations, but the workers there were not moved by threats and inducements. This proves that the masses of working people in Asia are loyal to the WFTU and its lofty goals.

The author concluded: The Beijing Representative Conference is new evidence of the maturity of the working class in colonial countries, who are mobilizing the broad masses to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, for national independence, for peace, and for friendship among all peoples.

　　亚洲千百万劳动人民团结一致为和平民主与民族解放而斗争   
    劳动报论亚澳工会代表会议
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一月三十日讯：劳动报顷登载达维多夫论亚澳工会代表会议的专文称，世界工联已成为世界职工运动的有决定意义的力量。在中华人民共和国首都北京举行的亚澳工会代表会议，就是世界工联力量与声誉日益增长的显著证明。
    达维多夫指出：亚洲各国年青的工会正在成为真正的战斗性的群众组织，成为民族解放斗争中最重要的支队。虽然情况与工作条件有所不同，但亚、澳各国的工会却找到了共同的语言，并已在北京达成了行动的一致，对于殖民地与附属国家的劳动人民，对于全世界的工人阶级，这是非常必要的。北京代表会议表示着亚洲国家千百万劳动人民团结一致、与全世界的工人联合起来为和平与民主而斗争的意志。这会议对美国和英国的反动工会领袖的分裂计划，对帝国主义者在工会运动中的走狗——各种各色的格林、莫莱、加莱和狄金之流，予以致命的打击。达维多夫强调指出，这个判逆集团曾竭尽一切努力来分裂亚洲的工会运动。分裂分子帮助了英国、法国和荷兰的殖民当局。美国垄断资本家对他们滥发津贴。当地的资产阶级警察和形形式式的恐怖手段，都被利用来摧残工会。然而，他们却不能瘫痪工人阶级争取团结的斗争。拟建立反动的“亚洲工会联合会”的计划，砰然粉碎了。只在某些国家（印度、伊朗），分裂分子才能建立可鄙的警察组织，但那儿的工人却不为威胁与利诱所动。这证明亚洲的劳动人民群众忠于世界工联及其崇高目的。
    作者最后说：北京代表会议是殖民地国家的工人阶级已经成熟的新证据，这些国家的工人阶级动员广大群众和帝国主义及其走狗们斗争，为民族独立、为和平与各国人民的友谊而斗争。
