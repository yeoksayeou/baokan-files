Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 27th. The Northeast Literary and Art Workers Congress was held from the 10th to the 20th. Attendees included 615 representatives of literary and art workers, literary and art movement organizers, and old artists from various parts of Northeast China. The congress unanimously agreed that literature and art should serve economic construction and depict new heroic figures. The Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles was also established at the close of the meeting. Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a special speech at the meeting entitled "Elevating Literature and Art to a New Level in the People's Construction Period." He first summarized the literary and artistic creation in the Northeast over the past four years, pointing out that during this period, literature and art devoted all its energy to the cause of defeating the enemy, portraying the heroic figures of the People's Liberation War and the land reform, and educating the people and cadres. The main shortcomings of this period were the insufficient portrayal of positive, upright figures representing the people. In addition, there were also tendencies towards naturalism and formalism in creative methods. He then emphasized that, since the construction period in the Northeast has begun, literary and art workers should organize themselves and use their strength in a planned way to portray the heroic figures and heroic undertakings in construction. We must reflect the faces of the working people and the new country from all sides, reflecting the new social life and new morality. The congress discussed this report, and the representatives examined their own works in connection with it. In the discussion, the representatives expressed that they would strengthen their political study, improve their ideological level, and go deep into factories, rural areas, and troops to discover and portray typical heroic figures of the construction period by participating in practical work. When Wang Huanan, a literary and art worker from the army who was wounded in the Liaoxi Campaign last winter and became disabled in both legs, spoke, all the representatives were deeply moved and encouraged, and unanimously passed a resolution to reward him in the name of the congress.

Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Li Zhuoran, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, both spoke at the meeting. Chairman Gao said: The development of the people's economy requires the strong cooperation and promotion of literary and artistic work. Literary and art workers should first of all encourage the enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and soldiers in production and construction, cultivate new virtues, and temper and enrich themselves in mass movements. Literary and art workers should discover the main and key things and ideas in the movement, and express them typically through research, so that literature and art can organize and promote the progress of the mass movement. Regarding the mutual relations between literary and art workers, Chairman Gao hoped that those with high awareness should help those with low awareness, those with low artistic skills should learn from those with high artistic skills, oppose mutual jealousy, ridicule, and sectarianism, and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism. Li Zhuoran pointed out that for popular literary and artistic activities, inappropriate and excessively high demands should not be made based solely on the appreciation level of a few cadres; however, popular literature and art should also pay attention to improvement and elevation, otherwise it will lag behind life. He also pointed out that strengthening learning is the key to the further development and improvement of literary and art work in the Northeast. He hoped that literary federations at all levels should regularly organize the study of current affairs and policies, and that literary and art workers in various places should conduct systematic criticism and self-criticism on the problems that occur in literary and art work from time to time; earnestly study the theories and experiences of advanced Soviet literary and art work; and carry out professional and cultural learning.

The congress adopted the charter of the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and elected 55 executive committee members and 14 alternate executive committee members, and elected Liu Zhiming as chairman, and Luo Feng and Shu Qun as vice chairmen, formally establishing the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The Northeast Association of Literary and Art Workers and the Northeast Opera Reform Association were also established on the same day.

　　把文艺提高到建设时期的新水平
　  东北举行文代大会
　  确定文艺新任务
    推动经济建设表现新英雄人物
　  东北文联成立刘芝明当选主席
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北文学艺术工作者代表大会已于十日到二十日举行，出席者有东北各地文艺工作者、文艺连动组织者、旧艺人等的代表共六百一十五人。大会一致认为：文艺要为经济建设服务，并要表现新的英雄人物。东北文学艺术界联合会也在会议结束时成立。中共中央东北局宣传部副部长刘芝明在会上作了“将文艺提高到人民建设时期的新水平”的专题发言。他首先总结了东北四年来的文艺创作，指出在这时期内文艺以它的全副精力致力于战胜敌人的事业，表现了人民解放战争和土地改革的英雄人物，教育了人民和干部。这时期主要的缺点是对于积极的、正面的、代表人民的人物表现得不够。另外在创作方法上也有自然主义和公式主义的偏向。接着，他强调提出：由于东北建设时期已经开始，文艺工作者应当组织起来有计划地使用力量，来表现建设中的英雄人物和英雄事业。我们要从各个侧面反映出劳动人民和新国家的面貌，反映出新的社会生活和新的道德。大会讨论了这一个报告，各代表并联系自己的作品进行了检讨。在讨论中，代表们表示今后要加强政治学习，提高思想水平，深入工厂、农村、部队，从参加实际工作中，发现并刻划出建设时期典型的英雄人物。当去冬在辽西战役中负伤因而两腿残废的部队文艺工作者王化南发言时，全体代表深受感动和鼓励，一致通过以大会名义给予奖励。
    东北人民政府主席高岗和中共中央东北局宣传部长李卓然都曾在会中讲话。高主席说：人民经济的发展，要求文艺工作的有力配合和推动。文艺工作者首先要鼓舞工人、农民、士兵的生产建设热情，培养新的品德，并在群众运动中锻炼学习，充实自己。文艺工作者要在运动中发现主要的、关键的事物和思想，经过研究，典型地表现出来，使文艺能组织并推动群众运动前进。关于文艺工作者间的相互关系，高主席希望：觉悟高的应该帮助觉悟低的，艺术低的应该学习艺术高的，反对互相妒嫉、嘲笑和门户之见，应正确地展开批评和自我批评。李卓然指出：对于普及的文艺活动，不要只凭一部分干部的欣赏水平，来作不适当的过高要求；但普及文艺也要注意改进和提高，不然就会落后于生活。他并指出，加强学习是东北文艺工作进一步开展和提高的关键。他希望各级文联应经常组织时事和政策的学习，各地文艺工作者应当并时常就文艺工作中所发生的问题进行有系统的批评和自我批评；认真学习苏联先进文艺工作的理论和经验；并进行业务和文化的学习。
    大会通过了东北文学艺术界联合会的章程，并选出执行委员五十五名，候补执行委员十四名，推举刘芝明为主席，罗烽、舒群为副主席，正式成立东北文联。东北文艺工作者协会和东北戏曲改进会也在同日成立。
