Xinhua News Agency, Boli, 29th: On the afternoon of December 27th (the third day), the last defendant to confess to the court was defendant Mitsutomo Katsuo, who was a member of Unit 100 from April 1941 to 1944. Mitsutomo personally participated in experiments using live people to test the effectiveness of various bacteriological weapons, the results of which caused people to die painfully. In July and August 1942, as a member of the sabotage group of Unit 100, he participated in anti-Soviet sabotage activities in the Trilielec area.

The defendant confessed that he worked in the Sixth Division of Unit 100, which had four well-equipped laboratories to conduct research and cultivate deadly bacteria, preparing for bacteriological warfare. The research work mainly focused on veterinary epidemics, namely, cultivating the bacteria of glanders, cattle plague, and anthrax. Each laboratory had ten to fifteen scientists and a considerable number of technicians.

Defendant: I mainly worked on cultivating glanders bacteria and also participated in experiments on live people.

Defendant Mitsutomo told the court that the Sixth Division's experiments on live people were conducted by him and scientists Iida, Lieutenant Colonel Nakajima, and laboratory assistant Matsui. The people to be experimented on were brought to the Sixth Division from the Gendarmerie Headquarters or the Japanese military delegation. These people were sent to the Sixth Division's detention room, and their names were removed and replaced with numbers. Mitsutomo also confessed that he personally poisoned two Russians to death after the "experiments," and he also executed many Chinese people in this way. His duty was to execute those who could no longer endure the experiments and bury their bodies.

Mitsutomo personally participated in the conspiracy to poison the river water and reservoirs in Trilielec.

He also described in detail the activities of Unit 100 in the Trilielec area, saying that this operation was led by Major Muramoto. Defendant Hirazakura also participated.

Prosecutor: What was the purpose of this operation?

Mitsutomo: This operation—or more precisely, these conspiracies—was aimed at studying and using glanders and anthrax bacteria to sabotage the Soviet Union. The expedition team released glanders bacteria into the Gilbuye River, and anthrax bacteria into the stagnant water of the reservoirs.

Trial of Defendant Onoe Masao

When the court convened on the morning of December 28th (the fourth day), the trial of defendant Onoe Masao began. From October 1943 to 1945, he served as the commander of the 643rd Detachment of Unit 731, actively and directly participating in the preparation of bacteriological weapons. The 643rd Detachment organized large-scale flea breeding for the purpose of spreading plague, and possessed equipment for large-scale cultivation of infectious disease bacteria. The so-called training section of the detachment systematically trained specialized personnel under Onoe's supervision in preparation for bacteriological warfare.

Onoe told the court that his profession was a doctor—a bacteriological expert. From 1935 to 1936, he received specialized training at the Tokyo Military Medical School, and thus became proficient in bacteriology. In October 1943, he was appointed as the commander of the 643rd Detachment stationed in Mudanjiang City.

Onoe, as the commander of the 643rd Detachment, actively and directly participated in bacteriological preparations, producing fleas on a large scale for Unit 731.

In response to the prosecutor's questions, the defendant confessed that the 643rd Detachment engaged in large-scale incubation of fleas and rodents for use in bacteriological warfare. The detachment possessed tens of tons of various materials that could be used to prepare culture media for incubating bacteria. The detachment had a special detachment engaged in catching rats. These rodents served as tools for incubating fleas.

The defendant went on to confess that from the spring of 1945, when Shiro Ishii once again served as the commander of Unit 731, he demanded the expansion of flea incubation and sent them to Unit 731.

The defendant told the court that he was well aware that Unit 731 used live people for "experiments." Plague bacteria and the bacteria of other infectious diseases were injected into their blood, and then the progress and development of the disease were observed until the person died. The defendant also knew about the use of bacteriological weapons in China. He said that these "experiments" killed thousands of lives.

Trial of Defendants Kikuchi Norizo and Kurushima Shigeharu

The court then tried defendants Kikuchi Norizo and Kurushima Shigeharu. Both confessed that they were personnel of units intended for bacteriological warfare, and they admitted that their work in these units helped prepare for the anti-Soviet war. For this purpose, they had studied bacteriology in specialized schools.

Prosecutor: Incidentally, it seems that you were trained in bayonet fighting in these schools?
Kurushima Shigeharu: Yes, we were trained in this way. We were told that Soviet soldiers were tall, so we had to learn to stab upwards with the bayonet.

Prosecutor: So you knew that you were being trained to fight against the Soviet Union?
Kurushima Shigeharu: Yes, we knew.

Questioning of Witnesses

After questioning Kikuchi Norizo and Kurushima Shigeharu, the court began to question witnesses. The first to be questioned was Colonel Tamura, the former Chief of the Personnel Department of the Kwantung Army. He testified that Lieutenant General told him that Unit 731 was preparing for bacteriological warfare and instructed him to select sufficient cadres for Unit 731.

This witness said that in June 1945, I received an order from General Yamada, the commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, to go to Unit 731. The unit commander, Shiro Ishii, submitted an official document to the commander of the Kwantung Army, requesting the provision of prerequisites for intensifying the unit's work.

Shiro Ishii also requested an increase in doctors and personnel in all aspects.

Witness Tamura (Chief of the Personnel Department of the Kwantung Army) saw bacteriological weapons prepared for use against the Soviet Union, as well as Chinese and Russians, including women, used as "experimental subjects" in Unit 731.

Prosecutor: What did you personally see in Unit 731?
Witness Tamura: Upon arriving at the unit, I inspected the factories, laboratories, and prisons holding prisoners. I saw equipment for large-scale production of bacteriological warfare tools, and I also saw rodents and a large number of fleas.

In the buildings of the unit, there were samples of shells and bombs used as bacteriological weapons. In Shiro Ishii's office, I saw some charts and diagrams illustrating the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons. In the prison, I saw forty to fifty prisoners, who were Chinese and Russians. Among the Russians, I saw a woman. Some of the prisoners had shackles on their feet. Most of them were lying on the floor because they were absolutely exhausted. As Ishii told me, they were the people being used for experiments in the unit.

Shiro Ishii told me that Unit 731 was fully prepared to launch a bacteriological attack. He told me that at the beginning of the war, these massive amounts of deadly bacteria would be deployed against the enemy. The witness said that I personally reported to General Yamada, the commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, that Unit 731 was ready to conduct bacteriological warfare. At the same time, I also reported the use of live people for experiments to General Yamada.

The court adjourned at this point in the morning.

At the afternoon session, the first to provide testimony was witness Furuichi, who had worked in the unit as an assistant physician for a long period of time.

Furuichi testified that in 1942, he personally participated in the dispatch team sent by Unit 731 to Central China. This dispatch team was led by Shiro Ishii. The "work" of the dispatch team was to conduct bacteriological attacks on Chinese soldiers and civilians.

Witness Furuichi (assistant physician of Unit 731) personally participated in poisoning in the "Central China Dispatch Team," manufactured "Ishii Dim Sum" for Chinese prisoners of war, experimented with typhoid bacteria, and forced women to contract syphilis.

Prosecutor: As a member of the dispatch team, what did you personally do?
Furuichi: I spread infectious disease bacteria in wells, reservoirs, and the residences of peaceful residents.

Furuichi then talked about the so-called "Ishii Dim Sum." In one area reached by our dispatch team, there were two Chinese prisoner of war camps. Ishii ordered the baking of three thousand pieces of dim sum and the introduction of typhoid and paratyphoid bacteria into them. Along with others, I participated in the work of putting bacteria in the dim sum. Our translator, Kasuga, distributed the bacteria-filled dim sum to the prisoners of war.

The Chinese prisoners of war, having been treated in this way, were released so that they could spread infectious diseases. Later, on Ishii's orders, biscuits were made and bacteria were placed in them. These biscuits were left at the prisoner of war camp site, as if they had been forgotten by someone. Later, scientific worker Kanie told me that paratyphoid bacteria were most effective in causing epidemics among Chinese residents.

In his testimony, Furuichi further revealed the shocking atrocities perpetrated in Unit 731—atrocities he witnessed or participated in. He talked about how members of the unit infected fifty Chinese people with typhoid and then began to study the "progress" of the disease; infected women with syphilis to study ways to prevent syphilis; and used live people for experiments to study frostbite and the effectiveness of blistering gas. All these people who were experimented on and destined to die the most painful deaths were held in the prison of Unit 731.

The next to provide testimony was witness Tachibana, a colonel in the military police. From 1939 to 1941, he was the commander of the Jiamusi Military Police Team, and later served as a military police advisor in the army of the puppet government of Manchukuo.

Tachibana told the court that the military police, on the instructions of the Kwantung Army, sent those destined to die to the prison of Unit 731. These people never left the prison because they died painfully as a result of various "experiments." They were sent there without trial by means of "special transport." Among them were people who participated in national movements, that is, Chinese patriots, as well as people who had connections with the communist movement, and elements disliked by the Japanese military.

Witness Tachibana (Military Police Colonel) and Kura Katsu (Military Police Sergeant) both escorted "special transports" to Unit 731, including Chinese patriots, communists, and people disliked by the Japanese military. Once sent in, they never came out.

As Tachibana described the details of the "special transport," the audience in Boli—the working people crowded in the courtroom—spontaneously expressed indignation. These people would be put in shackles and sent to prison, that is, to the prison of Unit 731, to be eliminated.

At the afternoon session, the last to provide testimony was witness Military Police Sergeant Kura Katsu. He had served as a military policeman in Unit 731. Kura Katsu testified that he had personally escorted people sent by the military police headquarters to Unit 731 as "special transports." He described in detail the terrible situation of how the Japanese soldiers who were preparing for bacteriological warfare tortured these people and used them as experimental subjects.

Prosecutor: Tell us, witness, who was the warden of the prison of Unit 731?
Kura Katsu: Ishii, the civilian brother of Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, the commander of Unit 731, was the warden.

In response to the prosecutor's questions, Kura Katsu testified that he had never heard of anyone leaving the prison of Unit 731. After this, the court adjourned.

　　苏联远东滨海军区军事法庭
  　继续审讯日本细菌战犯
  　审讯被告三友胜雄
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伯力二十九日电：十二月二十七日（第三日）下午审判庭上，最后向法庭招供的是被告三友胜雄，他从一九四一年四月到一九四四年是一百号部队的一员，三友亲自参加了用活人实验各种细菌武器的效能，这种实验结果使人痛苦地死去。在一九四二年七八月间，他以一百号部队破坏组一员的资格参加了特里列奇地区的反苏破坏活动。
    被告供认，他曾在一百号部队第六处工作，该处有四个装备良好的实验室，进行研究及培养致命细菌工作，准备细菌战争。研究工作主要集中于兽类流行病，即培养鼻疽病、牲畜黑死病和炭疽热的细菌。每一个实验室拥有十到十五个科学家和相当数目的技术人员。
    被告：我主要是作培养鼻疽病细菌的工作，也参加对活人的实验。
    被告三友对法庭说，第六处对活人的实验工作是由他和科学家饭田、中岛中佐和实验室助理松井来进行。要受实验的人被从宪兵队部或日本军事代表团处带来第六处，这些人被送入第六处的禁团室，以后便取消他们的名字，而编成号数。三友又供认，他亲自在“实验”后用毒药毒死过两个俄国人，他也这样处死过许多中国人。他的职务是处死那些不能再经受实验的人和埋葬他们的尸体。
    三友亲自参加到特里列奇在河水及贮水池内放毒的阴谋活动。
    他又详细描述一百号部队出动特里列奇地区活动，他说，这次出动是由村本少校率领。被告平樱也参加了。
    检查官：这次出动的目的是什么？
    三友：这次出动——或者更精确的说，这些阴谋活动，目的是在研究，也是在使用鼻疽和炭疽热细菌，对苏联进行破坏。这次出动的远征队在吉尔布耶河中放入鼻疽细菌，在贮水池的死水中则放入炭疽热细菌。
  　审讯被告尾上正雄
    十二月二十八日（第四日）上午开庭时，开始审讯被告尾上在雄。他从一九四三年十月到一九四五年任七三一部队六四三支队长，积极与直接地参加细菌武器的准备工作，六四三支队组织了大规模的跳蚤培养，用来传染鼠疫，拥有大规模培养传染病细菌的装备。该支队的所谓教练处，在尾上的监督下，有系统地训练专门人员以备进行细菌战争。
    尾上告诉法庭说，他的职业是医生——细菌专家，从一九三五年到一九三六年，他在东京军医学校受专门训练，因而精通细菌学。一九四三年十月，被指命为驻在牡丹江城的六四三支队的队长。
    尾上是六四三支队长，积极并直接地参加细菌准备工作，大规模为七三一部队制造跳蚤。
    回答检察官的讯问时，被告供称，六四三支队从事大规模孵育跳蚤和啮齿类动物，以便用于细菌战争。该支队拥有各种物资数十吨，可用以准备孵育细菌的培养液。该支队有从事捕捉老鼠的特别派遣队。这些啮齿类动物即充作孵育跳蚤的工具。
    被告继而供称，从一九四五年春天石井四郎再度担任七三一部队长时起，他就要求扩大孵育跳蚤的规模，并送它们到七三一部队去。
    被告告诉法庭他很清楚七三一部队用活人来做“实验”。把鼠疫细菌和其他传染病的细菌注射到他们的血液中，然后观察病的进行和发展，直到人死亡时为止。被告还知道在中国使用细菌武器的情形。他说，这些“实验”害死了千百条性命。
  　审讯被告菊池乘三与久留岛重治
    法庭继而审讯被告菊池乘三与久留岛重治。两人皆供认他们曾是拟进行细菌战的部队人员，他们承认，他们在这些部队中工作帮助准备反苏战争。为了这一目的，他们曾在专门学校中研究细菌学。
    检察官：附带说一下，你们似乎是在这些学校受劈刺的训练？久留岛重治：是的，我们是受这种训练。我们被告诉说苏联士兵是高大的，所以我们必须学会用刺刀向上刺。
    检察官：那么你知道你们是被训练来对苏联作战吗？久留岛重治：是的，我们知道。
  　讯问证人
    在审问过菊池乘三与久留岛重治之后，法庭即开始讯问证人。第一个被讯问的是证人前关东军人事处处长田村大佐。他供称，＠中将曾告诉他七三一部队是在准备细菌战争，并训令他为七三一部队挑选足够的干部。
    这个证人说，一九四五年六月，我接到关东军总司令山田将军要我去七三一部队的命令。该部队长石井四郎将一件公文送交关东军司令，请求提供加紧该部队工作的先决条件。
    石井四郎并请求增加医生和增加各方面的人员。
    证人田村（关东军人事处处长）在七三一部队看见准备对苏作战使用的细菌武器和当作“实验品”的中国人和俄国人，还有妇女。
    检察官：你在七三一部队亲眼看到什么？证人田村：在到达该部队时，我视察了各工厂、实验室和拘押犯人的监狱。我看见大规模生产细菌战争工具的装备，我也看见啮齿类动物和大量跳蚤。
    在该部的房屋中，有作为细菌武器的炮弹和炸弹的样品。在石井四郎的办公室内，我看了一些说明细菌武器效率的图表和图解。在监狱中我看见四五十个犯人，他们是中国人和俄国人。在俄国人中，我看见一位妇女。有些犯人的脚上带着脚镣。他们大多数都躺在地板上，因为他们已绝对精疲力竭了。和石井告诉我的一样，他们是在该部队中被用来进行实验的人。
    石井四郎对我讲，七三一部队已有充分准备发动细菌进攻。他告诉我，战争一开始，就会把这些巨量致死细菌投入敌人中。证人说，我把七三一部队已准备就绪可以进行细菌战的情形亲自报告给关东军总司令山田将军。同时，我并把用活人作实验的情形报告给山田将军。
    早晨庭至此休庭。
    在午后开庭时首先向法庭提供证言的是证人古市。他曾以助理医师的资格在该部队中工作过一个长时期。
    古市证明说，在一九四二年，他亲自参加七三一部队派赴华中的派遣队。这一派遣队由石井四郎率领。派遣队的“工作”就是对中国军队和平民进行细菌攻击。
    证人古市（七三一部队助理医师）亲自参加“华中派遣队”施毒，为中国战俘制“石井点心”，试验伤寒菌，并迫使妇女染上梅毒。
    检察官：作为派遣队的一员，你个人做过什么事？古市：我在井里与蓄水池中以及和平居民的住所散布传染病细菌。
    古市继而谈到所谓“石井点心”的情形。在我们派遣队所到达的一个地区，有两个中国战俘营。石井命令焙制三千枚点心并把伤寒与副伤寒细菌放进去。和其他人一道，我也参加了在点心中放细菌的工作。我们的翻译官春日把放了细菌的点心发给战俘。
    中国战俘受过这样待遇，就被释放了，好让他们散播传染病。后来，奉石井的命令，又制造了饼干并将细菌放入其中。这些饼干被留在战俘营所在地，好象是被什么人忘在那里一样。后来科学工作者蟹江告诉我，副伤寒细菌在促起中国居民中发生流行病方面最为有效。
    古市在他的证言中进一步透露七三一部队中施行惨不忍睹的暴行——他目击或参加过这种暴行——的情形。他谈到该队的人员使五十位中国人染上伤寒，然后开始研究疾病的“进展”；使妇女染上梅毒，来研究防止梅毒的办法；用活人做实验，来研究冻疮以及发泡瓦斯的效力。一切这些被拿来实验并注定要最痛苦地死去的人都押在七三一部队的监狱中。
    次一提供证言的是证人立花，宪兵上校。从一九三九年到一九四一年，他是佳木斯宪兵队司令，后来在满洲国傀儡政府的军队中任宪兵顾问。
    立花告诉法庭，宪兵队奉关东军的训令，把注定要死亡的人送到七三一部队的监狱中去。这些人因为遭到各种“实验”而痛苦死去从来没有出狱的。他们是不经审讯用“特别运送”方式送去的。他们之中有参加民族运动的人，即中国的爱国分子，还有与共产党运动有联系的人，以及日本军方所不喜的分子。
    证人立花（宪兵上校）和仓胜（宪兵中士），均曾押送“特别运送”赴七三一部队，其中有中国爱国分子，共产党人，和日本军方不喜欢的人。送进去，便永远出不来了。
    在立花叙述“特别运送”的详情时，伯力听众——拥挤在法庭中的劳动人民自发地表示愤慨。这些人会被加上镣铐，送到监狱中，这就是说送到七三一部队的监狱中去加以消灭。
    在午后开庭时最后提供证言的是证人宪兵中士仓胜。他曾经担任七三一部队的宪兵。仓胜作证说，他曾经亲身把宪兵队部送到七三一部队当作“特别运送”的人押去。他详细叙述了准备细菌战的日本军人怎样虐杀这些人、把他们当作试验品的可怕情形。
    检察官：告诉我们，证人，谁是七三一部队监狱的典狱长？仓胜：七三一部队队长石井四郎中将的哥哥文官石井是典狱长。
    在回答检察官的讯问时，仓胜作证说，他从来没有听说过有一个人走出七三一部队的监狱。此后，法庭即告闭庭。
