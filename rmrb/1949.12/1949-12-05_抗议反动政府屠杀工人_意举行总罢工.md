Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 4th: According to a report from Rome by the Electronegative Press on the 2nd, the general strike called by the Italian General Confederation of Labor on the 1st to protest the police shooting of agricultural workers in Torremaggiore, ended at 6:00 AM on the 2nd. On the night of the 1st, the parliament held a debate on this matter. During the meeting, the government dispatched thousands of fully armed police to guard the center of Rome and the area near the parliament. The parliament discussed the interpellation made by Vittorio, the General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, and Santi, the secretary, demanding punishment for the murderers. Interior Minister Scelba defended the police's atrocities in parliament. His words angered the meeting. Parliamentarian Laconi stood up and shouted towards the government seats, "Murderers! Your hands are stained with the blood of workers." Then Vittorio, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, rose to speak. He calmly described the details of the massacre in Torremaggiore and declared that the general strike was a protest against the idea that the police could arbitrarily shoot workers.

　　抗议反动政府屠杀工人
  　意举行总罢工
    【新华社北京四日电】据电通社罗马二日讯：意大利总工会号召于一日举行的抗议警察枪杀托里马基奥农业工人的总罢工，已于二日晨六时结束。一日夜，议会曾就在此事进行辩论，开会时，政府出动数千名全副武装的警察守卫罗马城中心和议会附近地区。议会讨论了意大利总工会总书记维多利奥和书记杉蒂所提要求惩凶的质询。内政部长谢尔巴在议会替警察暴行辩护。他的话激怒了会场，议员拉科尼站起来，向着政府的席位大中叫：“杀人犯！你们的手上染满了工人的鲜血”。接着总工会总书记维多利奥起而发言，他沉着地叙述托里马基奥被屠杀的详情，并且宣称：总罢工系抗议警察可以随意向工人开枪的想法。
