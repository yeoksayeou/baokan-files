　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 6th: TASS, New York: The three-day US-Soviet Relations Conference, sponsored by the "National Council of American-Soviet Friendship," opened in New York on the 3rd. Approximately 300 representatives attended the conference. Among those present on the first day were the well-known writer Howard Fast, United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America president Donald Henderson, "Soviet Russia Today" editor Jessica Smith, MIT professor Dirk Jan Struik, the author of "The Soviet Far East and Central Asia," Mandel, former UNRRA European Division Director Joseph, and the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship Chairman Kingsbury.

　　In his speech, Fast pointed out that the United States is trying to strengthen Germany and rearm Germany to make it a bulwark against the Soviet Union. He said: "The only supporters of the Anglo-American imperialist policy in Germany are the 'right-wing Catholic Party' and the unrepentant Nazi industrialists and financiers." He strongly warned that American policymakers are endangering the world and peace, and they are clearly suffering from the anti-communist madness they themselves have created. Fast strongly advocated the necessity of mobilizing the broadest masses of the American people as soon as possible to fight against the new war instigators.

　　Henderson's speech elaborated that US-Soviet friendship is the cornerstone of world peace and in line with the vital interests of the American working class. He vehemently criticized the highest leadership of the CIO for participating in the organization of the new international trade union federation established in London. He accused these swindlers of being direct agents of the US State Department, attempting to split the European working class.

　　Smith's speech explained that it is necessary to mobilize the American people to launch a movement demanding the declaration of the atomic bomb as illegal, disarmament, and a fundamental change in the current US foreign policy. She said: From the point of view of our highest interests, US-Soviet cooperation has become the most concerning issue, because it is related to the defense interests of the United States itself.

　　Joseph cited statistics from official American and United Nations documents, vehemently criticizing the Marshall Plan and proving its complete failure. He also proved that the progress in the recovery and development of industry and agriculture in the Soviet Union and other countries that have not joined the Marshall Plan is much greater than that of the Marshallized countries. He said that the Marshall Plan and military "aid" plans are undermining the living standards of the American people.

　　Professor Struik and writer Mandel vividly described the achievements of the Soviet Union at the meeting.

　　The meeting is still in progress.

　　美苏关系会议
  　在纽约开幕
  　美人民要求美苏友好
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：“美苏友好协会全国委员会”所主办的为期三日的美苏关系会议，已于三日在纽约开幕。出席会议的代表约有三百名，第一日会议到会的人中，有著名作家哈利·华德，产联食品与烟草工人工会主席韩德逊，“今日苏联”的编辑史密斯，麻省技术学院教授斯楚依克，“苏联的远东与中亚”一书的作者曼德尔，前联总欧洲分署署长约瑟夫和美苏友好协会全国委员会主席金斯贝莱等。
    华德在演说中指出：美国力图加强德国和重新武装德国使之反苏的堡垒。他说：“美英在德国的帝国主义政策的仅有的支持者，是‘右翼天主教党’和怙恶不悛的纳粹工业家和财政家”。强烈警告：美国的决策者危及世界与和平，他们显然正患着自己制造出来的反共的疯狂病。华德力言尽快动员美国最广大的人民大众为反对新战争挑拨者而斗争的必要性。
    韩德逊的演说阐述美苏友好是符合美国工人阶级切身利益的世界和平的基石。他猛烈抨击产联的最高领导机构参加组织在伦敦成立的新国际工联。他指责这些骗子美国国务院的直接代理人，企图分裂欧洲的工人阶级。
    史密斯的演说说明：必须动员美国人民发起要求宣布原子弹非法，裁减军备和基本改变美国现行外交政策的运动。她说：从我国最高利益的观点来看，美苏合作已变成最使人关切的问题，因为这是与美国本身的国防利害攸关的。
    约瑟夫引用美国和联合国的官方文件中的统计数字，猛烈抨击马歇尔计划并证明它的完全失败。他并证明苏联和其他没有加入马歇尔计划的国家，在战后工业和农业的恢复和发展上的进展，都比马歇尔化的国家大得多。他说：马歇尔计划和军事“援助”计划正在破坏美国人民的生活水准。
    斯楚依克教授和作家曼德尔在会上生动地描述了苏联的成就。
    会议尚在继续进行中。
