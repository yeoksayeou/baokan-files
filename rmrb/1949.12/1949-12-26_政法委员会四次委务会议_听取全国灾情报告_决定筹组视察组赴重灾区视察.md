    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: The Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council held its fourth meeting today, presided over by Deputy Director Peng Zhen. The meeting listened to a report from the Ministry of Interior on the general situation of the national disasters and the work of production for self-salvation. It was unanimously agreed that the national disasters this year are severe, especially the floods in Hebei, Pingyuan, Henan, and areas north of the Yangtze River in East China. Although the work of production for self-salvation in various places has initially begun, the feeling is that the strength is still insufficient. The key to disaster relief work at present lies in the procurement and transportation of grain, and it is necessary to implement unified leadership and strengthen organizational work. The meeting finally decided to form inspection teams to go to the heavily affected areas to conduct inspections in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation; and requested that the persons in charge of provinces with serious disaster conditions personally go to the disaster areas to conduct inspections and solve problems on the ground.

　　政法委员会四次委务会议
    听取全国灾情报告
    决定筹组视察组赴重灾区视察
    【新华社北京二十五日电】政务院政法委员会今日召开第四次委务会议，由代表主任彭真主持。会议听取了内务部关于全国灾情概况及生产自救工作的报告后，一致认为今年全国灾情严重，特别是河北、平原、河南及华东长江以北地区水灾尤为严重。现在各地生产自救工作，虽已初步展开，但仍感力量不足。目前救灾工作关键在于粮食的筹运，并必须实行统一领导，和加强组织工作。会议最后决定筹组视察组分赴重灾区视察，以深入了解情况；并要求灾况严重省份的各负责人亲到灾区视察，实地解决问题。
