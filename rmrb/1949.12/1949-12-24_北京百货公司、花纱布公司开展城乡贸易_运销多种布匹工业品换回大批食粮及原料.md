　　Beijing Department Store, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Develop Urban-Rural Trade
　　Transporting and Selling Various Cloth and Industrial Products in Exchange for Large Quantities of Grain and Raw Materials
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Branch of the North China Department Store Company and the Beijing Branch of the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company have achieved significant results in developing urban-rural trade. Since March of this year, the Beijing Department Store Branch has conducted material exchanges with Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, the Northeast, the Northwest, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Baoding, Taiyue, Jizhong, Jidong, and other regions. The methods of supplying goods to farmers include working through local state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, as well as organizing private merchants and peddlers. As of November, over the past nine months, the industrial products shipped by the company to the above-mentioned regions include: towels, socks, and undershirts totaling 263,193 dozens, soap over 26,700 boxes, scented soap over 18,200 dozens, matches 4,337 boxes, white and brown sugar over 1,638,300 jin, kerosene 720 barrels, pencils over 1,600 dozens, alkali powder over 951,000 jin, and also bedsheets, mattress covers, cigarettes, shirts, electric wire, paper, vulcanized blue, and other items. The Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch transported and sold over 140,000 bolts of cloth to various regions from April to November. In addition to exchanging for large quantities of grain, 22,230 bolts of cloth were transferred to the Northeast in exchange for 500 bolts of silk and 2,000 cubic meters of wood; 9,000 bolts of colored cloth were transferred to the Northwest in exchange for 2,000 bundles of thread (one bundle being equivalent to 4,800 strands). In addition, the company also purchased 5 million jin of seed cotton in various counties and districts near Beijing, achieving great results in developing urban-rural mutual assistance. According to the above, the two branches have achieved great success in transporting industrial products to the countryside; however, there is still insufficient planned and organized effort to exchange industrial and agricultural products, and to import various agricultural and industrial raw materials into the cities.

　　北京百货公司、花纱布公司开展城乡贸易
    运销多种布匹工业品换回大批食粮及原料
    【北京讯】华北百货公司北京分公司及华北花纱布公司北京分公司在开展城乡贸易上，已获得显著成绩。自本年三月起，北京百货分公司先后与内蒙、绥远、东北、西北、张家口、唐山、保定、太岳、冀中、冀东等地进行了物资交换。供给农民货物的方式除通过各地国营贸易公司及合作社外，并组织私商小贩。截至十一月止，九个月来该公司运往以上各地的工业品计有：毛巾、袜子、背心共二十六万三千一百九十三打，肥皂二万六千七百余箱，香皂一万八千二百余打，火柴四千三百三十七箱，红白糖一百六十三万八千三百余斤，煤油七百二十桶，铅笔一千六百余打，碱末九十五万一千余斤，尚有床单、褥单、纸烟、衬衣、电线、纸张、硫化青等物品。北京花纱布分公司自四月至十一月共运销各地布匹十四万余匹。除换回大批粮食外，其中调付东北各地的布匹二万二千二百三十匹疋换回绸子五百匹，木材二千立方米；调付西北各地色布九千匹疋换回线二千块（一块合四千八百捆）。此外，该公司并在京市附近各县、区收购籽棉五百万斤，在开展城乡互助上收到很大效果。据以上所述，该两分公司在调运工业品下乡工作上，已获很大成绩；但有计划、有组织地进行工农业品交流，把各种农产工业原料输入城市的工作，还作得不够。
