Another Shameful Failure of US-British Imperialism

The execution of the Bulgarian traitor Kostov and the conviction of his accomplices once again exposed the despicable faces of US-British imperialism and the Tito clique. The confessions of the criminals and Kostov's deathbed request prove that this treasonous conspiracy, like the Rajk conspiracy case in Hungary, was directly directed by US-British imperialist spy agencies and secretly colluded with the Yugoslav Tito gang. According to the orders of the US-British imperialist secret service and Tito, Kostov and his accomplices plotted to overthrow the Bulgarian People's Democratic government, conspired to assassinate Bulgarian people's leader Dimitrov, sabotage the friendly cooperation between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and spread rumors to undermine the prestige of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian government among the Bulgarian people. Under the direction of Yugoslav spies, they used their powers in state organs to place their accomplices in important positions, thereby carrying out various conspiracies. The aim of the US-British spy agencies was to make Bulgaria break away from the people's democratic camp and become a colony of US-British imperialists like Yugoslavia. The verdict on the traitor Kostov and his accomplices was a fatal blow to this despicable conspiracy of US-British imperialism and its running dog Tito clique, and has completely bankrupted it.

The conspiracies of US-British imperialism against the Eastern European people's democratic countries have suffered shameful failures in the people's democratic countries one after another. The Nagy treasonous conspiracy in Hungary was such, as was the Rajk conspiracy. The same goes for Mikolajczyk in Poland, Maniu in Romania, and the military fascist rebellion in Czechoslovakia. This time, the Kostov treasonous conspiracy in Bulgaria has also suffered a shameful failure, which shows the unparalleled strength of the Eastern European people's democratic countries. Their regime is tightly organized and consolidated, and all imperialist conspiracies cannot succeed. It can be predicted that after the removal of this group of despicable spies of foreign imperialism, the strength of the people's democratic countries will be further strengthened, and the friendship and cooperation between the countries will be further enhanced.

### 美英帝国主义又一可耻失败

　　美英帝国主义又一可耻失败
    保加利亚叛国犯科斯托夫的被处决及其同谋犯的被判罪，再一次揭露了美英帝国主义及铁托集团的卑鄙嘴脸。从罪犯们的供状及科斯托夫临死前的请求书中，证明这一叛国阴谋，正如在匈牙利的拉伊克阴谋案一样，都是受美英帝国主义间谍机关直接指挥，与南斯拉夫铁托一伙秘密勾搭着。科斯托夫及其同谋犯按照美英帝国主义特务机关与铁托的命令，曾策谋推翻保加利亚人民民主政权，阴谋杀害保国人民领袖季米特洛夫，进行破坏保加利亚与苏联及各人民民主国家间的友好合作关系，散布谣言破坏保加利亚共产党及保政府在保国人民中的威信。他们在南国间谍的指使下，利用其在国家机关的职权，把他们的同谋者安置到重要职位上去，从而进行各种阴谋活动。美英间谍机关的目的，在使保加利亚脱离人民民主阵营，如南斯拉夫一样变成美英帝国主义者的殖民地。叛国犯科斯托夫及其同谋犯的判决，是对美英帝国主义及其走狗铁托集团这一卑阴谋的致命打击，并已使之彻底破产。
    美英帝国主义反对东欧人民民主国家的阴谋在各人民民主国家已连续遭到了可耻的失败，匈牙利的奈基叛国阴谋是如此，拉伊克阴谋也是如此，波兰的米科拉兹柯，罗马尼亚的马尼乌以及捷克斯洛伐克的军事法西斯叛变亦无不如此。这次保加利亚的科斯托夫叛国阴谋同样遭到可耻失败，这显示着东欧各人民民主国家力量的无比强大，其政权组织严密而巩固，帝国主义的一切阴谋都无法得逞。可以预料到，在清除了这批下贱的外国帝国主义的间谍分子后，各人民民主国家力量将更加加强，各国间的友谊与合作将愈益增进。
