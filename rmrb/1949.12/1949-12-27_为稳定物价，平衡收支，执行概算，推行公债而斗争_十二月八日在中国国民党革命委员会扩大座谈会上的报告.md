　　Struggle to Stabilize Prices, Balance Revenue and Expenditure, Execute Budget Estimates, and Promote Public Bonds
    ——Report at the Enlarged Symposium of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on December 8
    Wang Kunlun
  　(1) Economic and Financial Characteristics in the Process of the People's Liberation War
    The revolutionary struggle resolutely waged by the Chinese people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has now achieved a basic victory and will complete a comprehensive victory. However, due to the disasters and difficulties left by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, the victory process of our People's Liberation War inevitably has several economic and financial characteristics: (1) Relying on the peasants, implementing land reform, liberating the peasants, and helping the peasants, transitioning from restoring agricultural production to increasing agricultural production, and from ensuring self-sufficiency for war victory to peacetime constructive self-sufficiency. (2) With the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and considering both public and private interests, transitioning from partially striving for the restoration of certain industries to comprehensively increasing industrial production, and then moving towards national industrialization. (3) In terms of fiscal policy, transitioning from relying solely on peasants to bear the burden of national fiscal expenditures to making urban industry and commerce also share a portion; from mainly supporting the military to gradually bearing comprehensive constructive regular revenue and expenditure; from price fluctuations, large-scale issuance, and huge deficits, to gradually stabilizing prices, tightening issuance, reducing deficits, and balancing revenue and expenditure. (4) In terms of international economic relations, transitioning from self-reliance on the one hand, not fearing the blockade of capitalist countries, and on the other hand, obtaining assistance from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, gradually moving towards completely equal and mutually beneficial international economic relations based on self-sufficiency.
    (2) Recent Price Fluctuations: The Situation and Impact
    Since the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, our economy and finance have begun to enter a new stage. In April of this year, the first relatively large price increase occurred, followed by a second fluctuation in July. Thanks to the appropriate allocation of materials and tightening of currency, considerable stability was achieved in August and September. However, the rapid development of newly liberated areas and the continuous increase in the number of troops and public employees quickly filled those gaps, while the amount of currency also increased accordingly. By mid-November, prices experienced a significant fluctuation, initially in the Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) and Shanghai areas, and then spreading to all parts of the country except the Northeast. The first to be affected by price fluctuations was our People's Liberation Army. With a large number of troops and soaring prices, the army's living conditions became even more difficult. Our southern expeditionary forces could only eat rice soaked in salt water. The average living expenses for our troops were only equivalent to 1,545 jin of millet per person per year. Under such difficult conditions, they still had to win battles and maintain discipline, which demonstrates that the Chinese People's Army possesses the world's rare excellent traditions of hardship, sacrifice, bravery, and combat effectiveness. Second were the general staff members. The average living expenses for our staff members were only equivalent to 1,800 jin of millet per person, including food, clothing, daily necessities, and supporting their families. After entering the cities from the countryside, living conditions changed, but salaries could not be increased, and they had to continue to serve the country and the people in difficult living conditions. The third was the life of the general public. Needless to say, workers and peasants, as well as most small urban industrial and commercial operators, were "selling small and buying big," making it difficult to buy back what they sold. Except for a very small number of profiteering merchants who took the opportunity to make profits, most suffered losses.
    (3) Main Reasons and Basic Nature of Price Fluctuations
    From July to November, the multiple of our increased currency issuance was quite large. First, it was for supplying materials and allocating materials. The Jingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) area alone needed 3.5 million jin of grain per day, and 300 million jin of grain had to be stored to meet needs. When a plague broke out in Chahar and transportation was interrupted, we transferred a large amount from the Northeast. In North China, we purchased a large amount of cotton; and in the autumn and winter, Central and South China, the military, industry and commerce, and the general public also needed cotton yarn and cloth. In terms of coal, we also did not make East China and Central China feel a shortage. Taking Shanghai as an example, from lacking coal in the past, it can now store 200,000 tons on a regular basis. Generally speaking, our material supply and transportation and distribution were quite adequate and prompt, but in order to control materials and allocate materials, we had to issue more currency. Second, it was due to the medical rescue of war wounds and the recovery and development of many undertakings, such as repairing railways, restoring shipping, subsidizing postal and telecommunications, investing in industry and mining, carrying out cultural, educational, and health work, and subsidizing cities, etc. No matter how much we save, we have to spend a lot of money. Third, the newly liberated areas are expanding day by day, order cannot be restored immediately, land reform and rent reduction cannot be implemented quickly, and much of the rural productivity is still in the hands of the landlord and rich peasant classes, and grain tax revenue cannot be fully collected for a while. On the contrary, we have to invest a lot to help these places establish order and carry out work. Establishing a large number of working cadres for rural work is absolutely indispensable for our revolutionary regime. Fourth, this year's floods, droughts, insect plagues, and wind disasters in various parts of the country have reduced agricultural production by about 25% compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. 60 million to 100 million mu of farmland across the country cannot be harvested, not only reducing income but also providing disaster relief. Fifth, for all the uprisings and surrenders of the Kuomintang's army, navy, and air force, we must welcome this expenditure burden. We must take care of the public employees left over from the Kuomintang and the large number of unemployed people in the cities. Even scattered soldiers and bandits cannot be allowed to scatter in all directions and disrupt order again. The people's government's policy of comprehensive responsibility is exactly the opposite of Chiang's regime's complete disregard for everything except the counter-revolutionary interests of the four major families, arbitrarily "disbanding" and "downsizing," resulting in widespread dissatisfaction. Sixth, the largest part of the burden is of course our existing army and staff. It is expected that the complete liberation of the mainland, plus the liberation of Taiwan and Hainan Island, will require more personnel next year. Based on what has been said above, it can be known that the main reasons for our huge expenditures, increased currency issuance, and price fluctuations lie only in bearing the exhaustion of reactionary sabotage, while at the same time striving for the victory of the People's Liberation War and the revolutionary cause. As for temporary or partial material turnover problems, there are also; and the harm of profiteering merchants taking advantage of the opportunity to make profits is also present, but it is by no means the main factor.
    Since the birth of our new China on October 1st, military, political, and diplomatic aspects have been rapidly victorious and developing step by step, and people's hearts have been encouraged. Everyone believes that China has since embarked on a bright road; but facing the recent economic difficulties, some people inevitably waver. This is because they can only see the phenomenon but not the essence, and can only see one stage, but not the entire development prospect. We must recognize that our economic difficulties and the economic crisis of the reactionary regime are fundamentally different in nature. They are shrinking, bankrupting, and heading towards irredeemable destruction, while we are growing, developing, and victorious, overcoming temporary difficulties and heading towards the final complete success of restoring production and increasing production.
    (4) Countermeasures to Stabilize Prices, Balance Revenue and Expenditure, and Overcome Difficulties
    The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has determined our entire basic policy on finance and economics. The policies and experiences reported by Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Northeast in overcoming difficulties and achieving victory can be gradually and effectively applied to the whole country in terms of basic methods. Now, taking the whole country as an example. First, the peasants must bear more burden for another period. In the past, the reactionary regime exploited 70% to 100% of the peasants' income, even to the point of making the peasants bankrupt and lose their lives. We have reduced the peasants' payment to the state to 20% of their income, which is of course still too heavy. But in the difficult process of completing the victory, our main reliance is still on the peasants. However, while asking them to bear the burden, we must on the other hand help them to remove oppression, restore production, and increase production. We must implement land reform, rent reduction and interest reduction, and disaster relief, and do our best to carry out water conservancy projects, reclaim wasteland, improve seeds, supplement fertilizers, increase agricultural tools, and improve technology. Second, it is to control materials and adjust materials. The Ministry of Agriculture plans to increase grain production by 10 billion jin and cotton by 4.7 million dan next year. It is expected that in the first half of next year, the government can control enough grain in each major region other than local consumption to properly distribute it to several major cities and store enough for use. Coal must be self-sufficient in each region to reduce transportation costs and enable the Northeast to export a portion. There must be a certain balanced ratio between grain, coal, cotton, and yarn. The ratio between cities and cities, and between cities and villages, must be fairly balanced. We must also exchange our necessities for soybeans, tea, bristles, tung oil, tungsten, antimony, tin, etc. For general prices, we must be able to gradually enhance our ability to control them and achieve a steady gradual increase. For this kind of work, due to the nature of our people's regime, the correct grasp of policies, and the strengthening of work efficiency, we dare to say that we are quite confident. For example, the recent adjustment of prices in Shanghai was prepared from mid-November and launched on November 30. Within three days, rice dropped to 110,000, Longtou fine cloth dropped to 130,000, and 20-count cotton yarn dropped to 2.8 million, all reaching the expected level. Third, for the issues of the army and staff, after reaching the saturation point next year, we must begin to gradually reduce them. Chairman Mao has already given clear instructions on the army's participation in production and construction in 1950. It is expected that mobilizing the army and women to work in the fields, combined with water conservancy projects and other plans, can increase grain production by 10 billion jin, and some staff members can also be transferred to various economic production departments. Fourth, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure must be given equal importance. Austerity has already begun to be implemented. We must never make the mistake of doing everything at once, but instead, we must distinguish between priorities and urgencies, and minimize expenditures as much as possible. The housing, equipment, and personnel treatment of various agencies from the central to the local level must be tightened. "Three people's food, five people eat; one room, several people live in." Everyone should tighten their belts and live frugally to overcome the economic difficulties of 1950.
    (5) On the 1950 Budget Estimates and the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds
    The 1950 national revenue and expenditure budget estimates put forward by the Central People's Government this time are the first budget estimates of the People's Republic of China. Although Minister Bo Yibo said that this is an outline drawn up based on incomplete materials, we know that it is indeed very honest figures prepared based on practical experience and needs, and a lot of effort has been put into taking care of many facts. Its greatest feature is that although we are engaged in a large-scale war, military spending only accounts for 38.8%, and we are establishing political institutions at all levels in the central and local governments and carrying out comprehensive political construction, but administrative expenses only account for 21.4%, which is absolutely impossible for reactionary regimes and imperialist countries. Secondly, in such difficulties, we must also invest in state-owned enterprises, and a reasonable proportion of the total reserve fund is left for cultural, educational, and health care. Third, the basic spirit of formulating this budget is, as Minister Bo said, "to determine expenditure based on income, and determine income based on expenditure, to collect it reasonably, and to use it properly." And daring to face difficulties, openly confronting difficulties, and being realistic to make the people and the government unite for fiscal policy, jointly take responsibility, and solve difficulties, is absolutely the opposite of the reactionary regime's deception of the people with the budget. For such a budget, we can only sincerely respond to Minister Bo's request, bear as much as possible, strive to collect, reduce losses, reduce waste, and ensure that we do not exceed expenditures or reduce income.
    In order to partially recover currency, make up for deficits, and stabilize prices, the Central People's Government has decided to issue People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds. The nature of these bonds, as stated in the first article of the government's decision, is to support the People's Liberation War, rapidly unify the country, and facilitate stabilizing people's livelihoods and embarking on the path of restoring and developing the economy. It is clearly the opposite of the public bonds issued by the reactionary regime, which are intended to carry out anti-people wars, undermine unity, poison people's livelihoods, and embark on the path of bankruptcy and death. It is also absolutely different from the issuance of public bonds by capitalist countries to allow capitalists to speculate and trade in the market and manipulate finance. Naturally, it is also different from the issuance of public bonds by the socialist Soviet Union entirely for construction. But from the perspective of the people's interests, the essence is the same. Although we can only seek the gradual recovery of production now, and not directly use this public bond for construction, it helps to solve the current difficulties and indirectly contributes to the construction cause. The large-scale issuance of currency has put more burden on all the people, and even transferred the losses to the workers and peasants, and it is impossible to make up for their losses. Public bonds can allow the industrial and commercial sectors to share a little of the peasants' burden, and the real value method will not harm the purchasing power of the public bond holders. Since the government announced the issuance of public bonds, it has been supported by all parties, especially the industrial and commercial sectors, which is gratifying.
    The greatest feature of all the important measures of our people's regime is that everything is based on the interests and will of the people. Therefore, it will be able to overcome difficulties and complete tasks with the support of the vast people's strength. We must recognize that this price fluctuation is an inevitable temporary phenomenon in our development process, and we must also recognize that these difficulties can be overcome by the joint efforts of all the people and the government. Therefore, we must strengthen our confidence, with an optimistic spirit and a serious attitude, and struggle to stabilize prices, balance revenue and expenditure, execute budget estimates, and promote public bonds! We must struggle against behaviors that do not implement the government's financial and economic policies, do not practice thrift, and do not work hard to produce! We must struggle against the psychology of wavering and pessimism that only sees temporary difficulties! We must struggle against behaviors that harm the people's interests and speculate for profit! The Chinese people have already won the basic victory of revolutionary liberation. In 1950, we must further consolidate and develop our great victory from the economic and financial struggle!

　　为稳定物价，平衡收支，执行概算，推行公债而斗争
    ——十二月八日在中国国民党革命委员会扩大座谈会上的报告
    王昆仑
  　（一）人民解放战争过程中的经济财政的特点
    中国人民所坚决进行的反帝反封建反官僚资本的革命斗争，到现在已经获得了基本的胜利，而将完成全面性的胜利。可是由于帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本所遣留的灾害与困难。我们人民解放战争的胜利过程中就必然具有经济与财政上的几个特点：（一）依靠农民，实行土改，解放农民，帮助农民，从恢复农业生产到增加农业生产，从保证战争胜利的自给自足走到平时建设性的自给自足。（二）以劳资两利，公私兼顾的政策，从局部性的争取某些工业的恢复走到全面性的工业增产，进而走向全国性的工业化。（三）在财政政策上，从纯由农民来负担国家财政开支转到使城市工商业也分担一部分；从主要的支援军事逐渐转入负担全面的建设性的正规收支；从物价波动，大量发行，赤字庞大，逐渐走到稳定物价，紧缩发行，减少赤字，和平衡收支。（四）在国际经济关系上，从一方面自力更生，不怕资本主义国家的封锁，一方面获得苏联及新民主主义国家的帮助，逐渐走八以自给自足为基础的完全平等互助的国际经济关系。
    （二）近来物价波动的形势和影响
    从天津北京解放以后，我们的经济财政开始走上一个新阶段，本年四月第一次呈现出较大的物价上涨，七月第二次波动，由于适当地调拨物资，紧缩通货，得到了八、九月间的相当稳定。可是新解放区发展过快，军队和公教人员的数额也不断增加，物资迅速地填补了那些空隙，同时通货的数量也随着增加，到十一月中旬的物价就起了一个极大的波动，波动的地区先是平津、上海，然后扩展到除东北以外的全国名地。物价波动首先受影响的是我们人民解放军。军队的数量既大，物价高涨，军队的生活就更加艰苦。我们南下的大军只能吃盐水泡饭，我们军队平均生活费每人每年只合一千五百四十五斤小米，在如此艰苦的条件下，还要打胜仗，守纪律，这说明了中国人民的军队是具有世界稀有的艰苦牺性勇敢善战的优良传统。第二是一般工作人员，我们的工作人员平均每人生活费只合一千八百斤小米，衣食日用养家活口都在内。由乡村进入城市，生活情形变更，待遇却不能提高，还要继续在艰苦的生活中为国家人民服务。第三是一般人民的生活，工人农民自不必说，城市小工商业者也大多是“小卖大买”卖出的就难于买进，除最少数投机倒把乘机取利的奸商以外，大多数是蒙受损失的。
    （三）物价波动的主要原因与基本性质
    从七月到十一月我们增发纸币的倍数相当的大。第一是为了供应物资与调发物资，单京津区每天需要三百五十万斤粮食，要储存不动以应需要的粮食三万万斤。当察哈尔发生鼠疫交通中断的时候，我们就从东北大量调拨进来。在华北我们收购了大量的棉花；而秋冬之交，华中、华南，军队、工商业方面以及一般人民也正需要棉花纱布；对于煤，也并没有使华东、化中感到缺乏，以上海为例，自缺少煤斤进到现在可常存二十万吨。一般说来，我们的物资供应和运输分配都作得相当够用而敏捷，可是为了掌握物资与调拨物资就不能不多发纸币了。第二是由于医救战争创伤和许多事业的恢复与发展，如修复铁路，恢复航运，津贴邮电，投资工矿，开展文教卫生工作和对城市的津贴等等，无论如何节省也要花不少的钱。第三，新解放的地区天天扩大，秩序不能立即恢复，土改和减租减息不能很快实行，很多农村生产力有些还掌握在地主富农阶级手中，粮税收一时不能足数。正相反，我们要大量投次进去帮助这些地方建立秩序，进行工作，为了乡村工作而设大批工作干部，是我们革命政权所绝不可少的。第四，本年全国各地水灾、旱灾、虫灾、风灾，使得农业生产量比抗日战前降低了百分之二十五左右，全国有六千万亩到一万万亩的农田不能收成，不但减少收，还要救济灾荒。第五，对于所有国民党陆海空军的起义投降，我们要欢迎这种开支负担，国民党遗留下来的公教人员，城市大批失业者，我们都要照顾，甚至散兵土匪，也不能任他散之四方，再来破坏秩序。人民政权对全面负责的政策，正与蒋政权除了为了四大家庭反革命利益之外，一切不管，随意“编遣”、“裁员”，弄得众叛亲离，恰恰相反。第六，负担最大的部分当然是我们现在已有的军队与工作人员。预计全国大陆完全解放，加上解放台湾、海南岛，明年还要增员。根据以上所说，就可以知道我们之所以开支浩大，增发纸币和物价波动的主要原因，就只在既承担了反动破坏的疲敝，同时又要争取人民解放战争和革命事业的胜利，至于一时的或局部的物资周转不灵也有；最省数的奸商乘机取利的扰害也有，但绝不是主要因素。
    从十月一日我们新中国诞生以来，军事、政治、外交，各方面都是很迅速的胜利与步步的开展，人心鼓舞，谁都相信中国已经从此走上光明的大道；但面对着近来的经济困难，就有些人不免发生动摇，这是由于他们只能看到现象而不会看到本质，只能看到一个阶段，而不能看到整个的发展前途，我们必须认识我们的经济困难和反动政权的经济危机是从性质上有基本的区别，他们是萎缩、破产、走向无可挽救的灭亡，而我们是生长、发展、胜利、从克服一时困难，走向恢复生产与增加生产的最后的全部成功。
    （四）稳定物价、平衡收支战胜困难的对策
    人民政协共同纲领已把我们对财经的整个的基本政策确定了。东北李富春副主席所报告东北克服困难获得胜利的政策与经验，在基本方法上是可以逐步用到全国而有效的。现在以全国而论。第一，是农民还要再多负担一个时期；过去反动政权剥削农民收入百分之七十，百分之百，乃至于使农民倾家丧命。我们使农民减到为国家支付他收入的百分之二十，这当然还是太重，可是在要完成胜利的困难过程中，我们主要的依靠还是农民，不过一面要他们负担，就必须另一方面帮助他们解除压榨，恢复生产和增加生产，我们要实行土改，减租减息，救灾救荒，尽可能的做兴修水利，开垦荒地，改良种籽，补充肥料，增置农具，改进技术等等工作。第二，是掌握物资和调整物资，农业部的计划要明年增产粮食一百亿斤，棉花四百七十万担。预计明年上半年各大区粮食除当地消费外，政府可以掌握足够的粮食把几个大都市分配得当，积储够用，煤要作到各区自给而减少运输的耗费，并使东北可以出口一部分。粮食、煤、棉花、纱布之间要有一定的均衡的比价，城市与城市，城市与乡村之间的比价都要能相当平衡。我们还要以大豆、茶叶、猪鬃、桐油、钨、锑、锡等出口，换取我们的必需品。对于一般的物价，我们要能逐渐增强控制的能力，做到平稳地逐渐上涨。对于这种种工作由于我们的人民政权的性质，正确政策的掌握，工作效能的加强，敢说是有相当把握的。例如最近对上海物价的调整，从十一月中旬后开始准备，十一月三十日发动，三天之内米降到十一万，龙头细布降到十三万，二十支棉纱降到二百八十万，都达到预期的程度。第三，对军队和工作人员的问题，到明年增到饱和点之后，就要开始逐渐减少。毛主席已经对于一九五○年军队参加生产建设有了明白的指示，预计发动军队和妇女下田，再配合上兴修水利等计划可以增加一百亿斤的粮食生产，而一部分工作人员也可以转入各种经济生产部门。第四，开源与节流必需同时并重，目前就已经开始历行节约。绝不能犯百废俱举的错误，而凡事要分别轻重缓急，尽量减少开支，从中央到地方各机关的房产、设备、人员待遇都要紧缩，“三个人的饭，五个人吃，一间房子几个人住”，大家节衣缩食，抽紧裤带，以渡过一九五○年的经济难关。
    （五）关于一九五○年的概算和人民胜利折实公债
    这次中央人民政府所提出的一九五○年国家收支概算是中华人民共和国的第一次的概算，虽然薄一波部长说这是根据不完全的材料所画出来的一个轮廓，但我们知道这确是根据实际经验与需要而拟具的很老实的数字，并且为了照顾到许多事实，煞费苦心。它的最大特点是，虽然我们正在进行着大规模的战争，而军费却只占百分之三十八点八，我们正在成立中央与地方的各层政治机构，展开全而性的政治建设，行政费却只占百分之二十一点四，这绝非反动政权和帝国主义国家所能作到。其次，在如此困难之中，还要为国营企业投资，文化教育卫生在总预备费留下适当比例的数字。第三，制定这个概算的基本精神是诚如薄部长所说“量入为出量出为入，取之合理，用之得当。”而敢于面对困难，公开困难，实事求是使人民与政府为了财政政策而结合一致，共同负责，来解决困难，这又是与反动政权以预算欺骗人民绝对相反。对于这样的概算我们只有竭诚响应薄部长的要求，尽量负担，努力征收，减少损耗，减少浪费，保证不突破支出，不减少收入。
    为了部分地收回纸币，弥补赤字，稳定物价，中央人民政府决定了发行人民胜利折实公债。这公债的性质正如政府的决定第一条所说，是为了支援人民解放战争，迅速统一全国，以利安定民生，走上恢复和发展经济的轨道。很明显地与反动政权所发公债，为了进行反人民的战争，破坏统一，毒害民生，走上破产死亡的道路恰恰相反。和资本主义国家发行公债以供资本家在市场上投机买卖，操纵金融，当然也绝对不同。自然也有别于社会主义苏联完全为了建设而发行公债。但从人民利益的观点上看，本质上是一致的，我们现在虽只能求生产的逐步恢复，还不是以这个公债直接用于建设，但它却是帮助解决目前困难而间接有助于建设事业的。纸币的大量增发使全体人民多加负担，甚至把损失都转嫁给工农群众，而且无法弥补其损失，公债却可以使工商界分任一点农民的重担，而且折实的办法，不会损失公债承担人的购买力。自从政府公布发行公债以来，已经得到各方面的拥护，特别是工商界表示热诚，值得欣慰。
    我们人民政权的一切重要措施的最大特点就是凡事都以人民利益人民意志为基础，因此也就必能由于广大人民力量的支持而克服困难，完成任务。我们既要认识这次物价波动是我们发展过程中必然不免的一时现象，也要认定这困难是可以由全体人民与政府共同努力而把它战胜。所以我们只有坚定信心，以乐观的精神，严肃的态度，为稳定物价平衡收支，执行概算，推销公债而斗争！我们要向着不执行政府财经政策，不厉行节约，不努力生产的行为斗争！要向着只看到一时困难现象而动摇悲观的心理斗争！要向着违害人民利益投机取利的行为斗争！中国人民是已经获得革命解放的基本胜利了，在一九五○年，更要从经济财政的斗争上巩固和发展我们已得的伟大胜利。
