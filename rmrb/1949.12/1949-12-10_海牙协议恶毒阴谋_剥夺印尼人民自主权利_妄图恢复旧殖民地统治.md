Let's look at Article 5 of the so-called Dutch-Indonesian Federal Organizational Law. According to this article, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands is the head of the Dutch-Indonesian Federation, and therefore also the head of the "autonomous" state of Indonesia. Here, the question arises: Why should the United States of Indonesia have the Queen of the Netherlands as its head? Why should the Indonesian people, who are fighting for the autonomy of the Republic, be ruled by a representative of a foreign dynasty?

The United States of Indonesia, in fact, has no representation in foreign relations. Some clauses of the agreement stipulate that in relations with certain countries, the Netherlands represents "the interests of the United States of Indonesia" (Article 4). Other clauses stipulate that Indonesia generally does not have the independent right to establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries, and can only do so with the decision of the Council of Ministers, which means that it still needs the approval of the Netherlands (Article 1).

The same is true in trade relations with foreign countries. The agreement stipulates that trade agreements with other countries can only be concluded with the consent of both parties, which also requires the approval of the Dutch government.

Regarding economic and financial issues, according to the agreement on resolving debts, the United States of Indonesia must bear all debts and loans incurred by the Dutch government in Indonesia since 1932. The United States of Indonesia must also repay "all domestic debts of Indonesia incurred before the attainment of sovereignty" (Article 25) and is responsible for paying interest on these debts. The Indonesian people will not only have to bear the debts of the Dutch aggressors for exploiting Indonesia's natural resources, but also the costs of the Dutch war against the Indonesian people.

　　海牙协议恶毒阴谋
  　剥夺印尼人民自主权利
    妄图恢复旧殖民地统治
    让我们拿所谓荷印联邦组织法的第五条来看吧，根据这一条，荷兰女王朱利安娜是荷印联邦的元首，因此，也就是印尼“自主”国家的元首。这里，问题就来了：一个印尼合众国为什么要由荷兰女王来作它的元首呢？正在为共和国的自主而奋斗的印尼人民，为什么要受治于外国皇朝的代表呢？
    印尼合众国在外交关系上，实际上是没有代表权的。该协议的某些条款规定，在与某些国家的关系上，由荷兰代表“印尼合众国的利益”（第四条）。其他的条款规定：印尼一般地没有独立与外国建立外交关系的权利，只有根据部长联席会议的决定，才能这样做，这就是说，还是须要得到荷兰的批准（第一条）。
    在与外国的贸易关系上，也有着同样的情形。协议中规定：与其他国家的贸易协定，只有在双方同意之下才能缔结，这也就是须要荷兰政府的批准。
    关于经济与财政问题，根据解决债务的协议规定：印尼合众国——必须担负一九三二年以来荷兰政府在印尼所负的一切债务与贷款。印尼合众国还必须偿付“在获得主权以前所负的印尼国内的全部债务”（第二十五条），并负有偿还这些债务的利息的责任。印尼人民将不仅必须负担荷兰侵略者的开发印尼天然富源的债务，而且还要负担荷兰对印尼人民作战的费用。
