　　Gold Miners
    Shen Shi
    The alluvial areas of the Datong River, Huangshui River, and upper reaches of the Yellow River in Qinghai Province are rich in placer gold. Every year in the fourth month of the lunar calendar, when the river ice melts, hundreds and thousands of workers come from afar, following the mine owners, to these areas to pan for gold, and they are not dismissed until the ninth month of the lunar calendar.

    Those workers scattered on the river beaches spend their days digging sand, carrying sand, and washing sand. The river water flows ceaselessly, and the sweat on the workers' bodies drips constantly. The sound of gurgling water is intertwined with the workers' "hum, cough! hum, cough!" sounds, forming a bleak picture.

    The mine owners are called "Jin Kezi" (gold merchants), and the mine owners call the gold miners "Sha Wa" (sand boys). The "Sha Wa" are mostly poor peasants. As the spring plowing season approaches, some farmers lack farm tools, and some lack seeds. They sell their labor for extremely low wages to solve the difficulties in spring plowing. The gold mines monopolized by the warlord Ma Bufang conscripted the "Sha Wa" gold miners who were all peasants. They watched their fields lie barren, abandoned their wives and children, and collected wealth for him under Ma Bufang's whips.

    After the "Sha Wa" step into the gold mine, they eat highland barley, black flour, and potatoes, and are often subjected to beatings and cruel private punishments by the "Jin Kezi" and foremen. They have to get up at the crack of dawn. If they are a little late to work, the foremen will use their fists and feet. If they don't finish their work during the day, they have to work overtime at night. The workers are not only not fed enough but also abused. Those who were originally in good physical condition slowly collapse. Meng Yingkui from Huangyuan County, who worked as a "Sha Wa" in the Xingxiu Sea gold mine in Dulan County for seven years, said: "Every year, we have to see many 'Sha Wa' die alive from illness or torture. I have worked for seven years, and I am still alive this year, which is really lucky."

    The "Jin Kezi" are extremely strict in preventing the "Sha Wa" from stealing gold. If the "Sha Wa" mine a piece of gold, they must hand it over to the "Jin Kezi." The "Sha Wa" can only take one-tenth. In order to prevent the "Sha Wa" from running away after mining a piece of gold, after the "Sha Wa" enter the account to rest, the foreman and the "Jin Kezi" stay in the tent to prevent "accidents." Gan Weikuan, a farmer from Huzhu County who used to be a "Sha Wa," narrated a tragic incident that happened in the Xingxiu Sea gold mine: "A farmer named Zhang from Huzhu County took his son and followed his uncle, a 'Jin Kezi,' to Xingxiu Sea to mine gold. One day, he mined a piece of gold and, fearing that his uncle would find out, hid the piece of gold in his cotton trousers. When he was sleeping, his companions found out and began to talk about it. His uncle heard it in the tent and forced him to hand it over. The 'Sha Wa' handed over the piece of gold, but the 'Jin Kezi' still thought he had not handed over everything and tortured him in every possible way. This poor farmer was tortured to death by his uncle. The 'Jin Kezi' was afraid that the 'Sha Wa's' son would go back to report to his family, so he threw him into the Yellow River under the pretext of sending him home!" This directly illustrates the darkness of the gold mines in the old society.

    Every year, Ma Bufang conscripted 30,000 to 50,000 migrant workers to pan for gold in various gold-producing areas, with four migrant workers sharing a sand bed, totaling more than 10,000 beds, and the total amount of placer gold obtained each year was more than 30,000 taels. In addition to the "district license" fee and business fee that the "Jin Kezi" should pay for privately operated gold mines, the "Sha Wa" also had to pay one qian five fen to three qian of gold each year, it is estimated that there are more than 10,000 "Sha Wa" each year, and Ma Bufang could levy two to three thousand taels of gold.

    The sweat and blood of the "Sha Wa" built Ma Bufang's layers of golden pagodas. However, the gold mining tragedy that has been going on for many years in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the Datong River, and the Xingxiu Sea area has basically ended because the People's Liberation Army destroyed Ma Bufang's evil rule in Qinghai. Now is the freezing period. When spring comes and flowers bloom next year, the gold miners will, with the assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, increase gold production as the masters of the new society and prosper Qinghai, which has been ravaged by Ma Bufang, and will never appear as tragic "Sha Wa" again.

　　淘金的人
    沈石
    青海境内大通河、湟水和黄河上游的冲积地带盛产砂金。每年农历四月，当河水解冻的时候，成千成百的工人，从老远的地方，跟着厂主，来到这些地区淘取砂金，直到农历九月，他们才被遣散回去。
    那些散布河滩的工人，成天地在挖砂、背砂和洗砂，河水不停地流，工人身上的汗珠也不停的往下淌，潺潺的水流声，交织着工人们“哼咳！哼咳”声，形成一幅凄切的图景。
    人们称金厂厂主做“金客子”，厂主叫淘金的人做“砂娃”。“砂娃”们多是穷苦的农民。春耕快到了，农民们有的缺乏农具，有的缺少种子，便以极低微的工钱出卖他们的劳力，来解决春耕中的困难。马匪步芳所独占的金场，那里淘金的“砂娃”都是征调去的农民，他们眼看着自己的田地荒芜，抛妻别子，在马匪皮鞭下，给他搜集财富。
    “砂娃”们踏进金场以后，吃的是青稞、黑面和洋芋，经常饱受“金客子”和工头的毒打和残酷的私刑。他们天刚发白就得起床，上工稍微迟一点，工头们便拳足交加，白天没有干完的活，夜里还得加工，工人们既吃不饱，又受虐待，体力本来好的也就慢慢地垮下去了。湟源县孟盈魁，曾在都兰县星宿海金场当过七年“砂娃”，他说：“每年咱得亲眼见到许多‘砂娃’活生生的因生病或被凌磨致死，咱干了七年，今年还好好的活着，真的算幸运了。”
    “金客子”防范“砂娃”极端严格，“砂娃”挖得块金，须交给“金客子”，“砂娃”只能抽十分之一。为了防止砂娃挖得块金后逃走，在“砂娃”入帐休息后，工头和“金客子”就留在帐房以防“意外”。当过“砂娃”的互助县农民甘惟宽叙述星宿海金场发生的一桩惨事：“互助县农民张某，带上他的儿子，跟他的舅父‘金客子’到星宿海去挖金子。一天，他挖得一块块金，怕他舅父发觉了，便将块金藏在棉裤里面。睡觉时，被同伴们知道了，便互相谈论起来，他舅父在帐房听见后，加迫他交出来。‘砂娃’交出块金，‘金客子’尚以为他没有全部交出，就百般拷打，这位可怜的农民，因此被他舅父磨折死了。‘金客子’怕‘砂娃’的儿子回去报告家人，借口送他回家，便把他扔到黄河里去了！”这直截了当的说明旧社会金场的黑暗。
    马匪每年征调三万到五万民工到各产金地区淘金，每四个民工一顶沙床，共计一万多顶床，每年获沙金总在三万两以上。私人经营的金场，除“金客子”应缴纳“地区执照”费和营业费外，“砂娃”每年还得课金一钱五分到三钱，估计每年有一万以上的“砂娃”，马匪可课金二、三千两。
    “砂娃”们的血汗，垒成马匪步芳层层的金塔。然而多年来在黄河上游、大通河、星宿海一带相沿的淘金悲剧，已经因着人民解放军摧毁马匪步芳在青海的罪恶统治而基本结束了。现在正是封冻期间，来年春暖花开的时候，淘金的工人将在共产党和人民政府协助下，将以新社会主人翁的身份，来增加金的产量，繁荣被马匪践踏得百孔千疮的青海，而永远不会以悲惨的“砂娃”身份出现了。
