Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: Under the direction of the United States, a farce of "transfer" and "acceptance" of "sovereignty of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia" between the Dutch government and its puppets was staged simultaneously in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Batavia, Indonesia, on the 27th.

According to reports from Reuters and Associated Press, the delegation led by Hatta, the Prime Minister of the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia," "accepted" the "sovereignty" signed by Dutch Queen Juliana at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam on the 27th. At the same time, Dutch High Commissioner to Indonesia, Lovink, also "transferred" the Dutch administrative authority in Indonesia to a delegation headed by the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Boewono, in Batavia. Lovink resigned and returned home immediately after the "transfer." However, Hirschfeld, the first Dutch High Commissioner to the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia," had already arrived in Batavia three days ago. After the sovereignty was "transferred," President Sukarno of the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" is scheduled to move from Yogyakarta to the commissioner's office in Batavia, the residence of the Dutch commissioner, on the 28th to establish his presidential palace.

US imperialism and its vassals unanimously applauded this farce, claiming it was "the end of three hundred years of Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia" (Associated Press). But even the French big bourgeoisie newspaper, Le Monde, could not hide its ridicule of this farce. The newspaper commented on the 27th that the newly established "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" "is almost entirely the effort of Washington. The State Department's spokesmen in the Security Council and the United Nations Commission played the traditional diplomatic tricks of American companies' investments in Indonesia." The US State Department announced on the 27th that the US government would recognize the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" within twenty-four hours; on the same day, Britain, India, Australia, Canada, the Philippines, Pakistan, and the Union of South Africa all announced their recognition of the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia."

　　美帝导演滑稽丑剧
  　荷兰哈达“主权”移交
    【新华社北京二十九日电】在美国导演下，荷兰政府及其傀儡间“移交”与“接受”“印尼合众国主权”的一幕滑稽剧，于二十七日分别在荷兰的阿姆斯特丹与印尼的巴达维亚两地同时演出。
    据路透社与合众社报道，“印尼合众国”总理哈达率领的代表团，二十七日在阿姆斯特丹皇宫“接受”荷兰女王朱利安娜签署的“主权”。与此同时，荷驻印尼高级专员洛文克也于巴达维亚将荷兰在印尼的行政职权“移交”给以日惹苏丹波乌诺为首的代表团。洛文克于“移交”后即行辞职回国。但荷兰驻“印尼合众国”首任高级专员赫什菲德，则已于三日前飞抵巴达维亚。在主权“移交”后，“印尼合众国”的总统苏加诺定于二十八日自日惹迁入巴城荷兰专员居住的公署，设立其总统府。
    美帝国主义及其附庸对于这幕滑稽剧，一致加以喝采，扬言这是“荷兰在印尼三百年殖民地统治的结束”（合众社）。但连法国大资产阶级的报纸——世界报也不能掩饰对于这幕滑稽剧的嘲笑。该报于二十七日著论说：新成立的“印尼合众国”，“几乎完全是华盛顿的努力。国务院在安理会和联合国委员会中的发言人，玩了美国公司在印尼的投资的传统外交把戏。”美国务院二十七日宣布，美政府将于二十四小时以内承认“印尼合众国”；同日，英国、印度、澳大利亚、加拿大、菲律宾、巴基斯坦、南菲联邦，均已宣布它们对“印尼合众国”的承认。
