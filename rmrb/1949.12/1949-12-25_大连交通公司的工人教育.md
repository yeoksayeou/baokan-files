The worker education at Dalian Transportation Company has a history of nearly four years. Before 1948, it mainly focused on political education, aiming to improve the working class's awareness and establish a new work attitude. After 1948, based on the workers' existing political foundation, the education policy shifted to cultivate a large number of construction talents. In addition to political education, systematic education in scientific knowledge and technical theory was carried out. In August 1948, the "Workers' Home" club was completed, and the technical school was located here to uniformly lead the employee education of the entire company. Regular education began in 1949, dividing workers into 30 classes according to their cultural level and business nature, with annual upgrades, requiring all employees to reach junior high school level within four years.

		Organizational Leadership
In terms of organizational leadership, the school affairs committee, composed of 11 members including the manager, factory director, department director, union chairman, director of the culture and education department, and the principal and director of the technical school, determines the overall education policy and plan. The technical school has a teaching affairs office, which leads the political teachers, cultural teachers, and technical teachers of each class. There are seven full-time teachers, and the rest are part-time, including factory directors, personnel section chiefs, technicians, and staff who do not leave production. In addition, the school unifies the learning content, compiles learning materials, and studies education methods. There is also a guidance office, which leads the head teachers of each class and is responsible for life management. The head teacher has a group leader, and the group has entertainment, wall newspaper, and learning committee members, as well as "little teachers." Some of the classes are specialized classes, and the students are workers who are detached from production, with the purpose of cultivating technical talents (half-day study, half-day practice); some are streetcar and car drivers and conductors, which are part-time, divided into three classes. Class A is at the second year of junior high school level, Class B is at the higher elementary school level, and Class C is at the lower elementary school level. They study for three hours a day, half a year as a semester, learning the basic knowledge of technology such as algebra. Some are workers from streetcar and car factories, divided into electrical and mechanical classes, studying for two hours a day, one year as a semester; some are staff from the company headquarters, divided into two classes, learning accounting, Class A learning cost accounting, and Class B learning commercial accounting. In addition, a very small number of illiterate people participate in literacy learning. Besides this, there is a cultural and art class, which is where the amateur cultural and art troupe learns its business. The learning system includes an examination system, with monthly and semester examinations. The promotion system is based on the examination results and learning effects of each semester. Grade D (literacy class) is promoted to Grade C, then to Grade B, Grade A, and finally to the specialized class.

		Life Management System
In terms of life management, there are also various systems, such as education rules, leave rules, canteen rules, reward and punishment regulations, reading rules, and item management systems. These systems are discussed by the workers themselves, and everyone consciously abides by them. The guidance office is responsible for inspecting this aspect of work.

		"Workers' Home"
The equipment for cultural education is relatively complete. The "Workers' Home" club has a large auditorium that can accommodate a thousand people, which can be used for drama performances in addition to meetings; there is a library and reading room with more than 3,500 books and magazines of various kinds, with sofas, etc.; there are three exhibition rooms: ① industrial exhibition room, including models of industrial machinery and excerpts of explanations, ② company business exhibition room, including various business statistics tables, economic income and expenditure charts, ③ union work exhibition room, including workers' learning, production model creation achievements; there are nine classrooms that can accommodate more than 500 people; there are dormitories, canteens, barbershops, and bathrooms; there is a sports field, divided into a football field, basketball court, swings, horizontal bars, wrestling grounds, high jump, long jump, shower facilities, etc.; there is a park, with conversation ponds, discussion tables, pavilions, fountains, flower beds, trees, etc.; in addition, each branch has simple classrooms and entertainment equipment. This kind of construction is very necessary for the cultural life of workers, but it must be done on the premise of developing production and accumulating wealth in order to improve the material and cultural life of workers in this way. Therefore, when production has not yet developed, construction in this area is very difficult.

		Several Issues
From the worker education at Dalian Transportation Company, we can see the following issues:

I. The emancipated workers have very strong political and cultural demands. In the transportation company, young people aged 16 to 25 account for 90%. After having a certain political awareness, they urgently demand to improve their culture and technology. Only by solving this demand can they feel that they have unlimited prospects and strengthen their sense of responsibility as masters. Since 1948, the phenomenon of turnover among conductors and drivers has been basically eliminated. In the past, people generally felt that this line of work was not promising and often turned over, but now they all reflect that it is really good to study like this. Four years is equivalent to graduating from junior high school, and in the future, they can also enter specialized classes, so they settle down and work hard.

		Establish Regular Remedial Schools
Moreover, due to the improvement and progress in politics and technology, they have played a great positive role in the production competition movement. Since the statistics in 1948, 74 rationalization proposals (creation, imitation) have been achieved, and a large number of heroes and models have emerged. Therefore, in order for the working class to shoulder the task of economic construction, it is necessary to plan for the long term and establish regular remedial schools to cultivate a large number of economic construction talents. (Now, in the entire transportation company, from administrative management to union cadres, except for the manager, all are promoted from workers; and 246 cadres, car drivers, accountants, etc. have been transferred to work in other areas.)

II. In the organization and leadership of learning, there must be a strict division of labor, a unified plan, and long-term planning.
Comrades responsible for all aspects of work implement a specialized system, without turnover, such as teachers who teach a certain course specialize in teaching that course. In addition, each grade has a certain learning plan, divided into basic subjects and specialized subjects, with half a year as a semester and one year for an upgrade, because only in this way can the workers' education be normally maintained and improved in the annual upgrades, in order to achieve the goal of cultivating high-level construction talents for the transportation industry.

		Improve Teaching Methods and Transform Teachers
III. Teaching methods and teacher-student relations: This mainly concerns full-time teachers who are detached from production. They are intellectuals and rarely have practical contact with workers. Therefore, for them, the improvement of teaching methods is also the combination of intellectuals and workers and the transformation of intellectuals.
At the beginning, in terms of teaching methods, they lectured dogmatically according to the textbook. Later, the workers raised opinions, and they turned to lecturing like they were teaching elementary school students, giving examples that were too superficial or very different from the workers' actual lives.
In addition, some teachers also had problems with their attitudes towards students, such as inconsistent attitudes towards students, some good, some discriminatory, and they would slap students who were dozing off, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers and formed a very disharmonious teacher-student relationship.
Later, the transformation was done in this way: first of all, making every effort to make teachers and workers integrate, teachers delving into the class to discover problems, such as teachers participating in students' self-study and discussions, the teaching affairs office establishing a teaching research association, discussing together, experimenting with teaching methods first, and when there were problems and difficulties, the director of the teaching affairs office would help solve them.
School full-time teachers and on-the-job teachers learned from each other, exchanged experiences, and discussed how to combine learning with practice. In terms of students, they strengthened mutual help, combining students with high and low levels, with the high levels helping the low levels at any time, and if they did not understand, they would reflect it to the teachers, who would then explain it in detail. Group leaders sometimes participated in the teaching research association, on the one hand reflecting the actual situation, and on the other hand helping others.
In addition, in the teachers' teaching methods, an important ideological problem must be solved, that is, the understanding of workers. Although workers have a low level of education, they have modern production knowledge and strong comprehension ability. Therefore, workers should not only be regarded as elementary school students, but also be distinguished from middle school students. The past six months have fully proved this point. Students in the specialized classes learned algebra, trigonometry, and geometry in six months, equivalent to several years of courses in middle school. In addition, the level of students in the specialized classes is not consistent, some with five years and some with ten years, but their acceptance level is the same, and the exam scores of some with five years exceed those with ten years.
In terms of teacher-student relations, it was handled in this way: students were given education on respecting teachers, not allowed to slap or beat, and opinions were reflected to the class leader, who would solve it together with the class leader and the personnel section chief. At the end of each month, students and teachers held a joint meeting for self-criticism. In addition, teaching affairs cadres, etc., collected students' opinions at any time and provided them to teachers.
Teachers were enlightened with democratic ideas and humbly learned from the workers. After the teachers became cautious, they were educated to be bold and responsible, and more democratic discussion methods were adopted to solve problems with students, such as dozing off, leading everyone to discuss whether it was good or bad, and how to correct it. In this way, the teachers gradually transformed and progressed, the teacher-student relationship gradually became closer, and the teaching effect gradually improved.

		Pay Attention to Cultural Education and Systematically Conduct Political Education
IV. In terms of learning content, pay attention to technical theory and common sense of physics, chemistry, and nature, and compile various teaching materials according to the needs of the workers. However, in political learning, there has been no systematic progress. In the past, some basic issues of the Chinese revolution were learned, as well as some temporary political education. Apart from this, there has been no more planned systematic political education to seek gradual improvement. This is a common problem in the current worker education in Lushun and Dalian.

		Improve Amateur Activity Equipment
V. The workers' amateur activity places and equipment should be as perfect as possible, especially in terms of learning, because after a full day of labor, if they go to a comfortable place, they will not only relieve fatigue, but also be relaxed and happy in spirit, the learning effect will be great, and they will be happy to participate in learning, so that workers will not feel that learning is a painful thing. In particular, the improvement of these places that are most closely related to the lives of workers will make the workers feel from the bottom of their hearts that they are truly the masters today, and that it is indeed different from the past.
In the "Workers' Home" club, every time after work, before and after meals and study, you can see workers in groups of twos and threes, distributed in various activity places. Some are reading newspapers and magazines on the sofas in the library; some are visiting and learning about the achievements in the exhibition room's exams; some are playing ball, climbing horizontal bars, swinging, wrestling, and playing wooden horses in the sports field; some are writing diaries on the stone tables in the park, some are singing... In short, everywhere is filled with the joy and laughter of the workers after work, which shows the importance of such equipment.

　　大连交通公司的工人教育
    大连交通公司的工人教育，已有近四年的历史，在一九四八年以前，是以政治教育为主，要求提高工人阶级觉悟，建立新的劳动态度。一九四八年以后，在工人已有的政治基础上，提出大量培养建设人材的教育方针，除政治教育外，并系统地进行科学知识与技术理论的教育。一九四八年八月“工人之家”俱乐部修建完毕，技工学术设在此地，统一领导全公司的职工教育。至一九四九年开始进行正规教育，按文化水平，业务性质，划分了三十个班，并逐年升级，要求四年内，使全体职工达到初中程度。
    　　　　组织领导
    在组织领导上，由经理、厂长、处长、工会主席、文教部长、技工学校的校长及主任等十一名组成校务委员会，决定整个教育方针与教育计划。技工学校下设教务处，领导各学习班的政治教师、文化教师、技术教师等，其中专任教员七名，其余是不脱离生产的厂长、人事股长、技师、职员等兼任；除此统一规定学习内容、编制学习材料、研究教育方法等。再有指导处，领导各学习班主任，负责生活管理。班主任下有组长，组内设有文娱、壁报、学习委员和小先生。学习班的划分一部分是专修班，学员是脱离生产的工友，以培养技术人材为目的的（半日学习半日实习）；一部分是电车、汽车的司机与车务员，是业余的，共分三个班，甲班是初中二年程度，乙班是高小程度，丙班是初小程度，每天学习三小时，半年为一学期，学习技术的基础知识代数等；一部分是电车、汽车工厂的工人，他们分电气与机械两个班，每天学两小时，一年为一学期；一部分是公司本部的职员，分两班，学会计，甲班学成本计算，乙班学商业会计。另外有极小部分的文盲，参加识字学习。除此还有一文工班，是业余文工团学习业务的地方。在学习制度上有考试制度，每月每学期进行考试，升级制度按每学期考试成绩、学习效果来升级，丁级班（识字班）升到丙班，再升至乙级班、甲级班，最后升入专修班。
    　　　　生活管理制度
    在生活管理方面，亦有各种制度，如教育规则、请假规则、食堂规则、奖励与处罚条规，阅书规则、物品管理制度。这些制度是通过工人自己讨论，大家自学遵守，负责检查这方面工作的是指导处。
    　　　　“工人之家”
    文化教育的设备上比较完善，“工人之家”俱乐部里有容纳一千作人的大礼堂，除开会外，可演剧；有图书室，阅报室，置各种书籍杂志三千五百余册，内有沙发等；有展览室三处：①工务展览室，包括工务机械的模型及摘选说明，②公司业务展览室，包括各种业务统计表，经济收支等图表，③工会工作展览室，包括工人学习，生产创模成绩；有教室九个，可容纳五百多人；有宿舍、食堂、理发室、浴室；有运动场，分足球场、篮球场、秋千、杠子、摔跤场、跳高、跳远、冲浴器等；有公园，内设座谈池、讨论桌、茅亭、喷水池、花坛、树木等；此外各个支会都有教室、文娱的简单设备。这种建设在工人的文化生活上来说，是很必要的，但必须在发展生产的前提下，积累了财富，才能如此改善工人的物质文化生活，因此，在当生产未有发展起来的时候，这方面的建设是很困难的。
    　　　　几个问题
    从大连交通公司的工人教育中，我们可以看到以下几个问题：
    一、翻了身的工人，政治文化要求非常强烈。在交通公司，十六岁至二十五岁的青年，占百分之九十，当有了一定的政治觉悟后，就迫切要求提高文化、技术。只有解决了这个要求，他们才能感到自己有无限的前途，并加强主人翁的责任感。从一九四八昕起，车务员、司机等流动现象基本消灭，过去一般人都感到这行手艺没出息，而经常流动，现在都反映这样学习下去真好，四年就等于初中毕业，将来还可入专修班，因此安心下来，好好工作。
    　　　　建立正规补习学校
    并且由于政治上技术上的提高、进步，在生产竞赛运动中发挥了很大的积极性，自一九四八年统计，合理化建议（创造、仿造）达七十四件，并涌现大批功臣、模范。因此，要使工人阶级担负起经济建设的任务，必须从长期打算，建立正规补习学校，培养大批经济建设人材。（现在整个交通公司，从行政管理到工会干部，除经理外，全是从工人中提拔出来的；并有二百四十六名干部、汽车司机、会计等调至外区工作。）
    二、在学习的组织和领导上，必须有严密的分工，有统一的计划和长期的打算。
    负责各方面工作的同志都实行专现制，不流动，如教那一门课的教员专教那一门。另外，每年级都有一定的学习计划，分基础学科和专修学科，半年算作一学期，一年一升级，因为这样才可能使工人的教育正常的坚持下去，并在逐年的升级中得到提高，以达到培养高级的交通工业的建设人材之目的。
    　　　　改进教学方法　改造教师
    三、教学方法与师生关系：这主要是脱离生产的专任教师的问题，他们是知识分子，很少与工人实际接触，因此，对他们来说，教学方法的改进，也就是知识分子与工人的结合和知识分子改造的问题。
    开始时，在教学方法上教条式照课本讲，以后工友提意见，又转而象对小学生讲课一样，举一些过于浅显的例子或与工友实际生活相差很远的例子。
    另外有些教师对学生的态度也有毛病，如对学生态度上不一致，有的好，有的歧视，对打瞌睡的学生则到跟前去拍打，这样就引起工友的不满来，形成师生关系极不融洽。
    后来是这样转变的：首先尽力使教师与工友打成一片，教师深入班内及特发现问题，如教师参加学生自修和讨论，教务室成立教学研究会，共同讨论，先实验教学方法，有问题和困难时，由教务主任帮助解决等。
    学校场任教师与在职教师互相学习，交流经验，讨论学习如何结合实际。在学员方面则加强互相帮助，程度高与程度低的学员结合起来，高的随时帮助低的，如果不懂则反映给教师，教师再详细解释。大组长有时参加教学研究会，一方面反映实际情况，另方面也可以进一步帮助别人。
    除此，在教师的教学方法上，必须解决一个重要思想问题，即对工人的认识，工人虽然文化水平低，但是他们具有近代化的生产知识，理解力强，因此对工人不但不能视如小学生，亦应区别于中学生。过去半年中充分证明了这一点，专修班的学生半年内，即学会代数、三角、几何，等于中学好几年的课程。另外，专修班学员的程度不一致，有五年的十年的，但其接受程度都一样，且五年程度考试成绩有些超过十年程度的。
    在师生关系方面是这样处理的：对学员进行尊师教育，不准摔摔打打，有意见反映给班长，由班长、人事科长会同教师一起解决。每月月终学生与教师开一次联席会进行自我检讨。另外有教务干事等随时搜集学员意见，供给教师。
    对教师则启发其民主思想，并虚心的向工人学习，后教师转成谨小慎微，则教育其大胆负责，对学生多采取民主讨论方式解决问题，如打瞌睡则领导大家讨论好不好，怎样纠正等，这样使教师逐渐的改造进步，师生关系也逐渐的密切起来，教学效果也逐渐提高。
    　　　　注重文化教育　系统进行政治教育
    四、在学习内容上，注重技术理论与物理化学及自然等常识，而且根据工友的需要编印了各种教材，但政治学习上，没有有系统的进行，过去学习了一些中国革命的基本问题，还有一些临时性的政治教育，除此没有更有计划的进行系统的政治教育，求得逐步提高，这是目前旅大职工教育中普遍存在的问题。
    　　　　改善业余活动设备
    五、工人的业余活动场所，设备应尽量求得完善，尤其是学习方面，因为白天整日的劳动，如果行到一个舒畅的地方，不但会解脱疲劳，而且精神上轻松愉快，学习效果大，又乐于参加学习，这样工人就不会感觉学习是苦恼的事情，特别这些与工人生活联系最密切的地方的改善，工人才会从内心感到今天真正的做了主人，确实与过去不同了。
    在“工人之家”俱乐部里，每到下班时，吃饭和学习前后可以看到三三两两的工友，分布在各个活动场所，有的在图书室的沙发上看报、读杂志；有的在展览室参观学习考试中的成绩；有的在运动场里打球、攀杠子、打秋千、摔跤的、玩木马的；有的在公园的石棹上写日记，有的唱歌……总之到处都洋溢着工友们劳动后的愉快，欢笑，这就说明了这样设备的重要。
