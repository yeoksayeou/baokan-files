　　Japanese Aggressors Organized Special Expeditionary Force to Spread Infectious Diseases in Central and Southern China
    Kawashima then described in detail the technology for culturing deadly bacteria. He further confessed to using bacteriological weapons on the Central and Southern China battlefields, and for this reason organized a special expeditionary force. In the summer of 1941, Japanese aircraft spread plague-infected fleas in the Changde area, and the plague began to spread among the peaceful people.

    In June 1942, the Japanese Army General Staff ordered the Second Expeditionary Force to China, the main purpose of which was to spread infectious bacteria in the area according to the principles of sabotage. During this operation, plague-infected fleas were scattered from airplanes, while cholera bacteria, paratyphoid bacteria, and anthrax bacteria were spread through reservoirs, wells, rivers, and other media.

    Prosecutor: "Tell us, why was the preparation for bacteriological warfare carried out in Manchuria and not in Japan?"

    Kawashima: "Because Manchuria is a country adjacent to the Soviet Union, and it would be easier and more convenient to take bacteriological weapons from Manchuria for use in the event of a war against the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Manchuria is very suitable for experimenting with bacteriological weapons."

    Prosecutor: "What are the conveniences?"

    Kawashima: "Manchuria has a vast territory. Moreover, Manchuria has a sufficient amount of experimental material."

    Prosecutor: "What is the experimental material? Is it the people who were arrested by the Kempeitai and sent to the prison of Unit 731?"

    Kawashima: "That is correct."

    Prosecutor: "As a bacteriologist, are you aware that the use of bacteriological weapons not only threatens the belligerent countries, but also threatens neutral countries with terrible disasters?"

    Kawashima: "Yes, I understand that."

    After the interrogation of the defendant Kawashima, the afternoon court session ended.

　　日寇曾组织特别远征队在华中华南散布传染病
    川岛接着详细描述培养致死的细菌的技术。他进一步供认在中国的华中及华南战场上使用细菌武器，并因此组织了特别远征队。一九四一年夏季，日机在常德地区散发传染鼠疫的跳蚤，于是鼠疫便在和平的人民中开始流行。
    一九四二年六月，日军参谋本部命令第二远征队开往中国，该队的主要目的是根据破坏活动的原则在该地散布传染性的细菌。在这次活动中，传染鼠疫的跳蚤是从飞机投散的，而霍乱菌、副伤寒菌，和炭疽热菌，通过蓄水池、井、河道和其他煤介传播。
    检察官：“告诉我们，为什么细菌战争的准备，在满洲进行而不在日本进行呢？”
    川岛：“因为满洲是邻近苏联的国家，而且在对苏战争一旦爆发时，从满洲拿出细菌武器使用是较为容易较为便利的。此外，满洲又是很适宜进行试验细菌武器的实验的。”
    检察官：“有什么便利呢？”
    川岛：“满洲有广大的领土。再者，满洲有足量的实验材料。”
    检察官：“什么是实验材料？是不是那些被宪兵队逮捕并被送到七三一部队的监狱里的人民呢？”
    川岛：“正是这些。”
    检察官：“作为一个细菌学专家，你是否懂得使用细菌武器，不仅使交战国受到威胁，而且也使中立国受到可怖灾祸的威胁呢？”
    川岛：“是的，我明白这一点。”
    审讯被告川岛后，下午庭于是结束。
