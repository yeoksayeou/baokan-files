　　Section 3: The Class Nature, Party Affiliation, and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy

　　The bourgeoisie and bourgeois political economists exhaust every method to cover up, conceal, obliterate, and deny the class nature and party affiliation of their political economy, attempting to deceive, mislead, and paralyze the proletariat and the masses. Such instances are commonplace. For example, during World War I, Japanese capitalism experienced considerable development, and capitalists expanded production in various factories. Capitalists then waved flags in major cities, recruiting workers everywhere. However, due to a shortage of workers, they loudly and extensively promoted preferential treatment for workers. Some unemployed workers, trusting the capitalists' propaganda, responded and were transported to the factories by the capitalists' cars. However, once inside the factories, all the promises made in the capitalists' propaganda vanished without a trace. Capitalists have always been the most calculating (in foreign countries, they are the best at using computers). For profits! Profits! More profits! Therefore, they must exploit! Exploit! More exploitation! Any capitalist who forgets profits or doesn't understand exploitation ceases to be a capitalist. Therefore, as long as capitalists can make money, as long as they can exploit, they exploit to their heart's content and make money to their heart's content. Only when workers become dissatisfied and engage in strikes or slowdowns do capitalists come out to say nice things, saying that workers only need to endure and work hard, that one person doing the work of two can get the wages of two. But when honest workers, trusting the capitalists' promises, shed their blood and sweat, intensify their labor, extend their working hours, and strive to improve labor efficiency to reach the level and achieve the goals demanded by the capitalists, the wage standards of our "benevolent" capitalist masters immediately drop. Therefore, no matter how hard workers work and how much blood and sweat they shed, they can never reach the level demanded by the capitalists and can never satisfy the insatiable desires of every fat-headed, pot-bellied capitalist. In the minds of capitalists, there is only how to exploit workers and how to exploit workers even more. They exist by relying on the proletariat and grow fat and develop by exploiting the proletariat. Only when the proletariat offers resolute opposition and strong resistance is it possible to reclaim some of the exploited labor results from the bourgeoisie. However, at another opportunity, the bourgeoisie will use another method to increase the exploitation of the proletariat to compensate for this "loss." Therefore, in capitalist society, capitalists and the bourgeoisie, for their own survival and for profits, and workers and the proletariat, for their own survival and for life, are in sharp opposition, constantly and repeatedly engaging in a life-and-death struggle. In this struggle, the proletariat wants to escape capitalist exploitation and chains, and only "through the violent overthrow of the entire existing social system" and the establishment of a socialist society is it possible.

　　Bourgeois political economic theories are all narrow-minded, nationalistic, and chauvinistic.

　　The bourgeoisie and the bourgeois political economists who are its defenders and spokespersons are politically nationalistic or chauvinistic based on the narrow class interests of the bourgeoisie. Similarly, in economics, they are narrow-minded bourgeois nationalists and bourgeois chauvinists. Their political and economic propositions, as well as their theories and policies, are all based on this narrow and reactionary bourgeois national view and bourgeois ethnic view. Some people mistakenly believe that Adam Smith was an internationalist because he advocated free trade. In fact, he was merely a representative and spokesperson for the interests of the British bourgeoisie in the early stage of British capitalist development. Because British capitalism developed earliest and the development of capitalist productive forces was higher than in other European countries, its commodities needed foreign markets to sell, and its commodity raw materials had to be supplied from overseas. Therefore, Adam Smith put forward the slogan of free trade, which in fact only reflected the demands of the British bourgeoisie for markets and raw material supply areas at that time. In contrast to the situation in Britain, Germany can be taken as an example. Germany was a relatively late-developing capitalist country. Initially, its productive forces could not catch up with Britain, so it could not compete with Britain. Therefore, it adopted a protectionist policy in trade, and in bourgeois political economy, there emerged nationalistic, protectionist, and anti-liberal economic theories represented by List and Roscher, which completely reflected the economic interests of the German bourgeoisie at that time. When capitalism entered the era of monopoly capitalism, competition among capitalist countries intensified, and countries established tariff barriers, increased tariff rates, and even adopted prohibitive tariffs. Tariffs evolved from a protective role to a monopolistic role, that is, from protective tariffs to tariff barriers. Economic scholars of various imperialist countries advocated this theory. After World War I, around the time Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Germany came to power under fascist rule, as mouthpieces of Italian and German fascism, in the realm of international bourgeois economic thought, there appeared the so-called totalitarian economic theories represented by Spann and Sombart. They openly flaunted anti-socialism and anti-liberalism. Their anti-liberalism was mainly because there were still some scientific elements in the classical school that were critically accepted by Marxist-Leninist political economy. Therefore, its anti-liberalism was mainly to oppose socialism and anti-Marxism-Leninism. It cleared the way in economic thought for the medieval reactionary fascist rule of Germany and Italy and its crazy militarist aggression and established a theoretical basis for the economic policies of German and Italian fascism, bringing German nationalist economic theory to its peak. They advocated the use of so-called vocational group economic forms such as medieval guilds, cartels, and cooperatives to realize the so-called totalitarian ideal. They advocated that Germany, which had been greatly weakened by the imperialist war and the capitalist crisis, should implement economic autarky (fascist self-sufficiency). They advocated that Germany should return to agriculture, allowing unemployed and semi-employed workers to return to the countryside and consolidating the production relations of Prussian landlords in the countryside. They advocated restoring the family as an economic production unit, called on women to return to the kitchen, advocated searching for living space abroad, promoted German and Italian fascist "civilization," and encouraged and instigated German and Italian fascist foreign aggression, bringing bourgeois nationalist economic theory to its peak. Around World War II, American imperialists used the Keynesian theory of the neoclassical school as the basis of their economic program, economic policies, and economic thought. Based on Keynesian theory, in addition to proposing so-called full employment domestically, subsidizing capitalist factories to start operations, increasing mass purchasing power, and implementing fascist rule, conducting deception and high-pressure tactics, they proposed and implemented a global expansion policy abroad, a plan to enslave the world, and openly opposed the Soviet Union, communism, and New Democracy, strengthening imperialist activities to seize global markets, investing heavily or subsidizing production by the government, engaging in military expansion and frantic war preparations, clamoring and inciting new wars of aggression, using arms, loans, and surplus materials to support reactionary forces around the world, turning these countries into their vassals, or helping them conduct counter-revolutionary civil wars to find outlets for American imperialism's surplus capital, and vainly attempting to rely on these to overcome and resolve its insurmountable crisis, conquer the world, and call it "cosmopolitanism," which in essence is nothing more than the total exposure or high expression of the world aggression of imperialism in its dying throes.

　　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点（５６）
    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    资产阶级与资产阶级政治经济学者就是这样用尽一切的方法来掩盖、隐蔽、抹煞、否认它们的政治经济学的阶级性与党派性，想借以蒙蔽、欺骗、麻痹无产阶级与人民大众，这种事情是数见不鲜的。例如第一次世界大战期间，日本资本主义获得相当发展，资本家各工厂的生产得以扩大，资本家遂在各大都市摇旗呐喊到处招募工人，但因工人缺乏，乃大吹大擂大肆宣传优待工人，当时有一些失业工人轻信资本家的宣传，应募工作，并由资本家用汽车载送入厂，可是进厂以后，所有资本家宣传中所允许的一切诺言，都无影无踪。资本家历来就是这样最会打算盘的（在外国应为最会使用计算机的），他们为了利润！利润！更多的利润！因此他们就要剥削！剥削！更多的剥削！那个资本家要忘记了利润，要不懂得剥削，那个就不成其为资本家了。所以资本家只要他们能挣钱，只要他们能剥削，他们无不尽情地剥削，尽情地挣钱的。只有当工人发生不满，爆发怠工、罢工的时候，资本家才能出来说好话，说什么工人们只要好好地忍耐，好好地工作，说什么一个人要做两个人的工作，就可以得到两个人的工资。但是当老实的工人们轻信了资本家的诺言，流尽血汗，加强劳动强度，延长工作时间，努力提高劳动效率，达到资本家所要求的程度和目的时，我们“仁慈”的资本家老爷们的工资标准也就马上降低了下来，所以工人无论如何卖死力气，流尽血汗，永远也是不能达到资本家所要求的水平，永远也不可能满足每一个肥头硕耳、大腹便便的资本家的无厌无尽的欲壑的。在资本家的心目中，只有怎样剥削工人，怎样更多的剥削工人。他们都是依靠无产阶级而存在，依靠剥削无产阶级而肥壮发展自己的。只有遇到无产阶级坚决的反对，强有力的反抗，才有可能从资产阶级方面夺回一些被剥夺的劳动成果来，但在另一个时机上资产阶级又是会以另一种的方法来加重对无产阶级的剥削，来补偿他这一部分的“损失”的。因此在资本主义社会里，资本家与资产阶级为了自己的生存，为了利润；工人与无产阶级为了自己的生存，为了生活，就这样尖锐的对立着，并经常不断反复不断地对立着，进行着你死我活的斗争。而在这种斗争中，无产阶级想要摆脱资本主义的剥削与锁链，只有“经过暴力的推翻全部现存的社会制度”，建立社会主义社会才有可能。
    资产阶级的政治经济学说都是狭隘的国家主义的和民族主义的
    资产阶级及作为它的辩护者代言人的资产阶级政治经济学者，他们在政治上都是基于资产阶级狭隘的阶级利益的国家主义者或民族主义者，在经济上也同样是狭隘的资产阶级国家主义的与资产阶级民族主义的。他们的政治主张经济主张以及学说政策，也都是基于这种狭隘的反动的资产阶级国家观和资产阶级的民族观出发的。有人因为亚当·斯密曾经主张贸易自由，因此就错误地认为他是国际主义者，事实上他也只不过是英国资本主义发展初期英国资产阶级利益的一个代表，一个代言人而已。因为英国的资本主义发达最早，资本主义生产力的发展比欧洲其他国家为高，它的商品需要国外市场来出卖，它的商品原料必须由海外各地来供给，因此亚当·斯密提出了贸易自由的口号，其实只反映了当时英国资产阶级需要市场需要原料供给地的要求而已。与英国相反的情况与相反的主张，可以德国为例，德国是资本主义发展比较后进的国家，开始时它的生产力的发展赶不上英国，因此不能与英国竞争，因此它在贸易上所采取的是保护主义的政策，而在资产阶级政治经济学上遂有以李斯特、罗夏尔等为代表的国家主义的、保护主义的、反对自由主义的经济学说出现，他们完全是当时德国资产阶级经济利益的反映。及至资本主义进入独占资本主义时期，资本主义各国竞争尖锐化的时候，各国间都相互建立了关税壁垒，加重了关税税率，甚至采取了禁止关税，关税就由保护作用进到了独占作用，即由保护关税进入了关税壁垒时期。主张这种学说的就有各帝国主义的经济学者。第一次世界大战以后，在意大利墨索里尼德国希特勒法西斯统治上台前后，作为意德法西斯主义的传声筒，在国际资产阶级的经济思想领域内，便有以史班与桑巴特等为代表的所谓全体主义经济理论的出现，它们公开以反社会主义、反自由主义为标榜，而它们的反自由主义，主要的还是由于古典学派中还有若干科学的成分，为马列主义政治经济学所批判地接受，所以它反自由主义主要也是为了反社会主义，反马列主义。它为德意中世纪式反动的法西斯统治和它疯狂的黩武侵略主义，在经济思想中扫清道路，并为德意法西斯的经济政策建立理论根据，使德国国家主义经济学说达到了登峰造极，他们主张以中世纪的基尔特、卡特尔、合作社等所谓职团经济的形态，实现所谓全体主义的理想。他们主张为帝国主义大战与资本主义危机所大大削弱了的德国实行经济上的奥太基（法西斯的自给自足）；他们主张德国应当回复到农业去，使德国失业的半失业的工人回到农村去，并巩固农村中普鲁士地主的生产关系；主张恢复家庭为经济生产单位，号召妇女回到厨房去；他们主张对外找寻生存空间，宣扬德意法西斯“文明”，鼓励策动德意法西斯对外侵略，使资产阶级国家主义经济学达到了登峰造极的地步。第二次世界大战前后，美帝国主义者以新古典学派凯恩斯学说作为他们经济纲领经济政策与经济思想的基础；他们依据凯恩斯学说，除了在国内提出了所谓充分就业，补贴资本家工厂开工，提高大众购买力，并实行法西斯统治，进行欺骗高压以外，对外提出与进行了全世界扩张政策，奴役世界的计划，并公开以反对苏联、反对共产主义、反对新民主主义做标榜，加强帝国主义的活动来侵占全世界市场，由政府大量投资或津贴生产，进行军备扩充与疯狂备战，叫嚣煽动新的侵略战争，以军火、以借款、以剩余物资来支援全世界反动势力，把这些国家变为自己的附庸，或者帮助他们进行反革命内战，来为美帝国的过剩资本寻觅出路，并妄想依靠这些来克服解救其不可克服的危机，征服全世界，而美其名曰“世界主义”，实质上无非是帝国主义垂死期最后挣扎的世界侵略主义的总暴露或高度表现而已。
