　　Northeast Military Region Political Department Stipulates
　　Unified Progress for Troops' Cultural Studies
　　Monthly and Quarterly Examinations to be Held
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to regularize the cultural education of troops, the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region issued a decision on the 12th, uniformly stipulating the progress of cultural education for all troops and establishing a formal examination system. The decision stipulates that cultural education should be divided into quarters of three months each, with each quarter calculated as one hundred and forty-four hours of actual education time. The department has formulated a progress schedule for each study group for the six months starting from December 1949, and requires each division to formulate monthly progress based on the schedule and specific circumstances, and each regiment to formulate weekly progress. The examination system stipulates that a small examination should be held once a month, presided over by the propaganda and education section of each regiment, and the results should be reported to the political department of the division monthly; a large examination should be held once every three months, presided over by the propaganda and education section of the division, and the results should be reported to the political department of the Northeast Military Region quarterly. The examination results—whether individual or unit results—should be made public, and appropriate rewards should be given to those with excellent results.
