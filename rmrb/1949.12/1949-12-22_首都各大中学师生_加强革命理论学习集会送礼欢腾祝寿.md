    Strengthen Revolutionary Theory Study, Gather to Celebrate and Present Gifts for Birthday
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Teachers and students from major middle schools in the capital are enthusiastically celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin. Starting from the 17th, schools have successively held birthday celebrations, lectures, symposiums, speech contests, sports events, bonfire parties, and other activities.
    Hua Bei University held a birthday celebration at the school headquarters on the 21st, which was also attended by Soviet educator Filippov. Filippov said in his speech that in the Soviet Union, the name of Stalin defeated fascism; the name of Stalin restored the destroyed cities, factories, and collective farms. The name of Stalin represents victory, peace, freedom, and democracy. Vice President Fan Wenlan explained from a historical perspective that Comrade Stalin's contribution to the working people of the world is great and immortal. He wished that when Comrade Stalin celebrates his 100th birthday, all mankind will be liberated. The assembly passed a telegram congratulating Stalin amidst warm applause. Subsequently, Comrades Ma Chengqi and Li Xin led a waist drum team to the Soviet Embassy to offer birthday greetings.
    All faculty, staff, and students of the China University of Political Science and Law have enthusiastically launched activities to celebrate the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin since the 17th of this month. Under the call of "not sticking to formality but emphasizing substance," this birthday celebration movement has become an internationalist education and learning movement. In addition to broadcasting Stalin's life story, Stalin and the Chinese revolution, etc., every day, Vice Dean Luo of the school gave special reports on the 19th and 20th to strengthen and improve internationalist education. On the evening of the 20th, a birthday party was held, and all employees of the school participated. The performances included international dances of national unity, chorus, birthday poem recitations, and dramas. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, the school held a birthday celebration assembly, which was also attended by President Xie. At 12:00 noon, more than 100 staff members of the school gathered in the hall to hold a birthday tea party. President Xie attended and spoke, pointing out that everything is easy to handle when the world has Stalin, and everything is easy to handle when China has Mao Zedong! He encouraged all staff members of the school to celebrate the birthday with practical actions. At about 1:00 PM, the school leaders and honor guard went to the Soviet Embassy to offer birthday greetings, bringing birthday gifts including a red satin character "Shou" (longevity), a longevity screen, and a signature book, which symbolize health and longevity, and are Chinese specialties.
    The National Institute for the Hui People also held a celebration ceremony yesterday (21st) at 4:00 PM.
    The Political Science Department of Peking University published a special issue to celebrate. The contents include Professor Qian Duansheng's "The Stalin Constitution", Professor Wang Tieya's "Stalin's Correct International Policy", Professor Wu Enyu's "Stalin—The First Contemporary Social Scientist", Professor Xu Deheng's "Respectfully Wishing Marshal Stalin a Happy 70th Birthday", Professor Gong Xiangrui's "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution", Professor Wu Zhichun's "Stalin's Place in History", and Professor Lou Bangyan's "Stalin Teaches Us to Understand the National Question".
    Tsinghua University and the Municipal No. 8 Middle School held Soviet photo exhibitions. Fu Jen Catholic University and Xinsheng Middle School established Soviet Cultural Halls and China-Soviet Friendship Halls, which officially opened on the 21st. At the same time, schools generally launched the study of "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution" written by Chen Boda and enthusiastically purchased Marshal Stalin's works. On the 21st, teachers and students from various schools lined up to present gifts to the Soviet Embassy to celebrate the birthday, expressing their high respect for Marshal Stalin with various gifts. Students from the New China Women's Vocational School made a longevity star figurine. The China Agricultural University used black beans and millet to form the character "Shou" in a frame. Students from the Nursery Department of the Normal University sewed a pair of little girls, saying, "Chinese little babies love Stalin, and we will also dedicate our determination to devote ourselves to nursery work as a birthday gift to Marshal Stalin."
