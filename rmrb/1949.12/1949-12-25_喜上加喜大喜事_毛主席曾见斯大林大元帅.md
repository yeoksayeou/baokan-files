　　Double Happiness, Great Joy
    —Chairman Mao Met with Marshal Stalin
    Ma Fantuo
  　　　　　　I
    Radio, whirring,
    Singing Bangzi opera, then drum ballad,
    Take a break from the rickshaw,
    Listen to the broadcast in front of the tea shop.
　
    Broadcast news is good,
    Broadcast news aplenty,
    Double happiness, great auspicious event:
    "Chairman Mao has arrived in Moscow!"
　
    Everyone smiling,
    Streets filled with joy,
    Newsboys running and shouting selling extras,
    Workers and women singing in groups.
    　　　　II
    You cheer,
    I say wonderful:
    "Our Chairman Mao meets with Stalin,
    Our country's affairs will be easy to handle!"
　
    "Our Chairman Mao meets with Stalin,
    Bringing with him the hearts of us all.
    In the past, reactionaries prevented us from interacting,
    Now no one can break apart our friendship!"
　
    "Our Chairman Mao goes to Moscow,
    Bringing with him the hearts of us all,
    Thank you to Lenin and Stalin's revolutionary thought for guiding us!
    Thank you to the Soviet people for countless assistance!"
　
    "Our Chairman Mao meets with Stalin,
    The two of them having a heart-to-heart talk,
    We hope they talk about building a new China,
    We hope they talk about how to guarantee world peace."
    　　　　III
    You say a word,
    I say a word,
    Words can't express the joy in our hearts!
    Words can't describe the happiness in our hearts!
　
    Revolutionary victory is one joy,
    The founding of New China is another joy,
    Double happiness, great joyful event,
    Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union is joy upon joy!
　
    Chairman Mao is the representative of the Chinese people,
    Marshal Stalin is the representative of the Soviet people,
    The representatives of two great nations shake hands, embrace,
    Like the people of two great nations shaking hands, embracing!
    　　　　IV
    China was originally the imperialists' warehouse,
    China was originally the imperialists' rear,
    The Chinese revolution has been victorious,
    The imperialists have lost their warehouse, lost their rear!
　
    The Soviet Union has a population of 200 million,
    China has a population of 475 million,
    Add the two numbers together,
    Occupying almost half of the world's population!
　
    The Soviet Union is a powerful red lion in the West,
    China is a victorious red lion in the East,
    Red lions unite with red lions,
    The American paper tiger is just a piece of paper.
　
    The world's two largest countries combined into one camp,
    The world's two largest revolutionary forces join hands and advance,
    This is an invincible force,
    World peace is guaranteed!
    　　　　V
    Look, at the Moscow train station,
    The national flags of China and the Soviet Union flutter in the wind.
    The great leader of the Chinese people
    First time stepping into the homeland of socialist revolution!
　
    Look, at the command post of the world peace and democracy movement
    —the Kremlin is brightly lit,
    The two great revolutionary giants of the twentieth century
    Meeting for the first time!
　
    That great teacher of progressive humanity
    Smiling at his comrades and students,
    Appearing before him,
    As if it were the standing up East!

　　喜上加喜大喜事
    ——毛主席曾见斯大林大元帅
    马凡陀
  　　　　　　一
    无线电，呜呜呜，
    唱完梆子唱大鼓，
    放下三轮歇会儿，
    茶叶庄门口听广播。
　
    广播消息好，
    广播消息多，
    喜上加喜大吉事：
    “毛主席到了莫斯科！”
　
    人人眯眯笑，
    满街喜洋洋，
    卖报小孩连奔带跑卖号外，
    工人妇女成群结队把歌儿唱。
    　　　　二
    你也叫好，
    我也说妙：
    “咱毛主席会见斯大林，
    咱国家的事情就好办了！”
　
    “咱毛主席会见斯大林，
    就是带去咱大伙儿一片心。
    从前反动派阻挡我们来往，
    如今谁也拆不散我们这份交情！”
　
    “咱毛主席上莫斯科，
    就是带去咱大伙儿心一颗，
    谢谢列宁、斯大林的革命思想来领路！
    谢谢苏联人民给咱数不清的帮助！”
　
    “咱毛主席会见斯大林，
    两个人一块儿谈心，
    咱盼望他们谈谈建设新中国的事情，
    咱盼望他们谈谈怎样保障世界和平。”
    　　　　三
    你一言，
    我一语，
    说不尽心头乐！
    诉不尽心头喜！
　
    革命胜利是一喜，
    新中国成立又一喜，
    喜上加喜大喜事，
    毛主席访苏喜上喜！
　
    毛主席是中国人民的代表，
    斯大林大元帅是苏联人民的代表，
    两大国家的代表握手、拥抱，
    好比两大国家的人民握手、拥抱！
    　　　　四
    中国本是帝国主义的仓房，
    中国本是帝国主义的后方，
    中国革命胜利了，
    帝国主义丢了仓房，没了后方！
　
    苏联人口两万万，
    中国人口四万万七千五百万，
    两个数目加起来，
    占去全世界人口一小半！
　
    苏联是西方一头力大无穷的红狮子，
    中国是东方一头百战百胜的红狮子，
    红狮子联合红狮子，
    美国纸老虎真是一张纸。
　
    世界最大两个国家结合成一个阵营，
    世界最大两个革命力量携手并进，
    这是一个无敌的力量，
    世界和平有了保证！
    　　　　五
    看啊，莫斯科火车站上，
    中苏两国国旗迎风飘扬。
    中国人民的伟大领袖
    第一次踏进社会主义革命的家乡！
　
    看啊，那世界和平民主运动的司令台
    ——克里姆林宫里灯火辉煌，
    二十世纪两大革命巨人
    第一次聚首一堂！
　
    那进步人类的伟大的导师
    望着他的战友和学生微笑，
    出现在他面前的，
    仿佛就是那站立起来了的东方！
