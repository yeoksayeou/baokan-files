　　Following closely, the news from the temple spread quickly! Uncle Niu Bao and his wife also came to confess. Niu Bao said he was wrong for not confessing earlier, and asked the masses to handle it; Niu Bao's wife, however, was a bundle of tears and a nose full of sourness, crying and shouting, "I'm a widow halfway through life! I have children to feed! Let's speak plainly! Yu Bao has supported me for half my life! Back when Yu Bao was making ghosts and acting violently, how could I say I wasn't afraid? But for the sake of food! I could only help them to stir things up! Everyone! Back then, Yu Bao wanted to dump me and marry someone from the Bai Quan family, I originally wanted to shout out about his ghostliness! But then he didn't marry her, so I stayed with him! I had no choice! Now that Yu Bao is a stinker, I have no one to turn to. If everyone is lenient with him, I'm still thinking of staying with him! I'm just a woman! Would I dare to confess all this? I hope everyone is lenient with me! Please be gentle in your judgment, and I'll get through this..." Liu Goujia glared and blustered at her, "Can't you produce for yourself? Do you still want to wear a cheongsam and stroll around Yangquan?" She was about to cry and vaguely explain further, but Shuan Cheng stopped her and told Yu Bao and the others to go back and think it over carefully, and wait for everyone to discuss the matter.

　　This matter caused a commotion in the village, and people even shouted less about distributing the fruits of labor and opening the kiln. Everyone hated Ju Baoqian's brain and Yu Bao to the bone. Everyone automatically held meetings, shouting for the worker-peasant association to report the matter to the county, demanding that the county increase the punishment for Qian Dabrain. At the same time, they all shouted that Yu Bao must be detained. Even Da San, who hadn't been seen in public for a long time, was strutting around the village with his chest out and his head held high, saying to everyone he met, "I, Zhang Yuanlu, from the very beginning, I didn't believe in any gods or ghosts!" He also suggested to Shuan Cheng, "No question! Just send Yu Bao and Niu Bao to the county! There's no need to detain them in the village!" At that time, Shuan Cheng felt that since people had confessed themselves, they should be lenient and not detain them; but most of the other committee members didn't have an idea. The villagers were shouting about detaining them every day, so the worker-peasant association had no choice but to temporarily detain Yu Bao first.

　　After this matter was over, the worker-peasant association then continued to prepare to distribute the fruits of labor; but the villagers were shouting to quickly fix up Xilu's big kiln while the weather was still good. Everyone was very enthusiastic. Every time they held a meeting, whether discussing the distribution of the fruits of labor or something else, people always brought up the big kiln and clamored about it. At this time, more and more neighboring villages were opening iron furnaces and coal kilns, but they still lacked good coal. They all knew that the coal from the Black Stone Slope's big kiln was strong, and they also heard that the story of the Old Lord causing ghosts was false, so they constantly sent people to Black Stone Slope to make suggestions, asking to quickly fix up the big kiln. One village even said, "If you don't want to do it, selling it to our village is fine; you can discuss the price!" The Black Stone Slope villagers regarded the kiln even more as a treasure, and everyone said that it could not be sold, it must be fixed up. Every day, people urged the worker-peasant association to quickly let Da San and the others go down to the kiln to make plans, and quickly figure out how to raise capital and start work immediately. Even Xilu was even more enthusiastic. This commotion made Shuan Cheng feel flustered in his work, but he was determined: he had to fix up this big kiln! He remembered that the village hadn't had a proper, long-term big kiln in sixty years, remembered Da San's skills, and the enthusiasm that Da San had for this big kiln over the years, and also that Da San had mentioned to him not long ago about fixing up this big kiln, but for some reason, Da San's enthusiasm for the kiln hadn't been great these days. Several times he had asked him to lead the way down to the kiln to plan how to start work and estimate the capital, but he didn't say he wouldn't do it, but he never took action! Shuan Cheng felt that he was too busy, and hadn't properly bothered Da San for maybe a month or two. Da San must have a lot of complaints! So, he took some time to find Da San.

　　When he saw Da San, he again talked about letting him go down to the kiln to make plans, but Da San was listless, not even looking at him, only saying, "The big kiln? You discuss it and do it if you want to!" Shuan Cheng said, "This time, when Old Yin comes back, it will definitely be done! This is the opinion of everyone in the village! Uncle Da San, everyone has long discussed letting you take the lead in discussing the opening of the kiln, why haven't you taken action? This is the time for you to show off your skills! If you say you won't do it, who else can do it! I know you have opinions about the village's work, but you have to say what your opinions are!" Da San had been angry about this kiln for a long time, wanting to explode, but now hearing Shuan Cheng's straightforward words, he suddenly felt soft-hearted, as if he had a belly full of grievances to immediately pour out, but he didn't know where to start, so he could only lower his head, breathing heavily but not speaking. Looking at this scene, Shuan Cheng didn't know why he also felt uncomfortable, so he squatted down to the side, and said softly, "Uncle Da San! This kiln has to be done somehow! But tell me, how can it be done without you! You... you get your spirits up! You see, I've really been too busy these days, and I haven't bothered you, I know... you, you not only have opinions about the village's work, but you must also have opinions about me!" Da San stood up, pacing back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back, saying, "What opinions do I have! I know you're busy... you have connections, but I'm still the same old me, and I don't have any connections!" Neither of them spoke after that. Da San just kept pacing back and forth, and Shuan Cheng just watched Da San walk back and forth. After a while, Little Foreign Devil was looking all over the village for Shuan Cheng for something, and Tianlu came back and told Shuan Cheng, and then Shuan Cheng left.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４４）
    康濯
    紧接着，庙上的风声传出去好快！牛宝叔嫂也跑来坦白了。牛宝说他早不坦白实是不对，要求群众处理；牛宝他嫂却一包眼泪一鼻子酸，连哭带嚷道：“我这半路守寡呀！孩没孩吃没吃呀！咱明打明说吧！我可是玉宝养活了半辈子啊！那会玉宝闹鬼弄武的，我能说不怕么？可为了嘴呀！我也只能打帮他们张罗闹呀！大伙哟！那会玉宝要撂了我娶白泉家，我原本要给他嚷出那鬼事情的呀！可他又不娶了，咱就又跟了他呀！我没办法呀！事到如今，甭看玉宝是臭人一个，我没人跟，往后只要大伙宽大他，我还想着跟他哩！我一个妇女老婆呀！我这就敢往出坦白么？你大伙宽大我哟！抬抬手往轻里处理处理，我就过去了哟……”柳沟家瞪着眼吹唬她道：“你不会自己生产？莫非还想穿旗袍逛阳泉？”她又要啼哭马虎地诉说，但拴成止住了她，并叫玉宝他们三人回去再好好思想思想，等大伙讨论处理。
    这事情闹得村里乱嘈嘈地，人们连分果实和开窑的事也嚷得少了，一个个都对聚宝乾大脑和玉宝恨入骨髓，大伙并自动开会，嚷着要工农会把这事报告县里，要求县里加重处理乾大脑，同时都嚷着非扣玉宝不行，连多时不大到人前的大三，这阵子也挺着胸膊仰头瞪眼地在村里晃来晃去，见人就说：“我张远禄起根就不信他妈鬼神的！”他并跟拴成提议：“没说的！玉宝牛宝干脆送县！村里也不用扣了！”当时拴成只觉着事情是人家自己坦白的，就该宽大，不扣才对；别的委员们却多没主意，浑村大伙也每日光嚷着扣呀扣的，工农会只得暂把玉宝扣起来再说。
    赶这完了，工农会才又接着准备分果实；但村里人们却都嚷着要赶早趁节气拾掇喜禄的大窑，个个劲头都鼓得足足地，每回开会，不管是讨论分果实或是别的，人们总要扯上大窑咯嚷一阵。这时左近邻村开铁炉开煤窑的也一天天多起来，但还是缺好炭；他们都知道黑石坡的大窑炭强，又听说了老君爷闹鬼的事是假的，也就不断派人来黑石坡提意见，叫快拾掇大窑，还有个村并说：“你们要是不闹，卖给咱村也行；你们讨论价钱吧！”黑石坡村可更把这窑当成了宝贝，人人都说不能卖，一定要拾掇，并天天有人催工农会赶紧让大三他们下窑作计划，赶紧想法闹垫本立时动手，就连喜禄的劲头也更大了，这么闹得拴成工作上头也慌了手脚，但他却下定了决心：非拾掇这大窑不行！他想起村里六十年来一直没个象模象样闹长远了的大窑，想起大三的把式，和这些年来大三喜爱这大窑的那股劲，还有前不久大三也跟他提过要拾掇这大窑的主意，但不知为什么，这些时大三对窑的劲头倒并不大，好几回叫他领头下窑计划怎么开工和估计垫本，他不说不干，却又老不动手干！拴成觉得自己实在太忙，许有一两个月没好好跟大三捣拉了，大三准有满肚子意见吧！于是，他抽了个工夫，寻大三去了。
    他见了大三，又把让他下窑计划的事说了说大三却没劲没劲地，看也不看他，只说：“大窑么？你们讨论下要闹就闹吧呗！”拴成道：“这回等老尹回来，可准得闹！这是浑村大伙意见嘛！大三叔，大伙早就讨论，让你来领头合计开窑的事，你怎么老不动手？这正该着你施展施展把式哩！你说你不干又叫谁干啊！我知道你对村里工作有意见，可这意见你也得说呀！”大三这些时一直为这窑生气的老想发火，现在听了拴成这么干脆的话，却忽地心软了，好象有一肚子冤屈要立时吐出来，可又不知从哪里说起，只得低着脑袋，嘴里光出大气却不说话。拴成看着这情景，不知怎么心眼也难受起来，就圪＠①在一边，轻声说道：“大三叔！这窑是怎么也得闹的！可你说吧，闹嘛怎么也离不了你的！你……你提起劲头来吧！你看这些时我着实是太忙，我也没寻你捣拉过，我知道……你，你不光对村里工作有意见，对我也准有意见！”大三立起来，抄着两手在屋里来回走着，一边说：“我有啥意见！我知道你忙……你认识高，可我还是他妈个这，又没认识的！”下边二人都不说话了，大三只顾来回走，拴成就看着大三走来走去；一会，小洋鬼满村寻拴成有事，天禄回来告给了拴成，拴成才走。
