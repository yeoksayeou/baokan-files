　　Cadre Cultural Classes Attached to Primary and Secondary Schools
　  Chaoyang, Liaodong Province, Experiments with Success
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to overcome the difficulty of finding teachers for cultural studies for cadres, the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chaoyang County (Rehe Province) Education Committee decided to attach the cultural classes for cadres to local middle and primary schools, and preliminary results have been achieved. The cultural classes of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee School and the Chaoyang County cadre cultural classes have not been successful since their establishment in July and October. The main reason is that the teachers are all cadres in active service who have been away from school for a long time, feel unfamiliar with the subjects, and are busy with their own work, resulting in insufficient preparation for lectures. Not only is the teaching efficiency not high, but there are also instances of lateness and absenteeism. In addition, cadres are often transferred, and teachers are frequently changed for some courses, even leaving classes empty, creating a chaotic situation. The students' enthusiasm for learning has also been affected, leading to absenteeism.

    In response to the above phenomena, the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee School, under the guidance of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, decided to attach the cultural classes to complete primary schools, issue letters of appointment to teachers, and provide remuneration that is in principle no less than the salary they receive for teaching primary school courses. Before the attachment, the class held a mobilization meeting for all students, reviewed the shortcomings of the past leadership, and accepted the opinions of all students regarding leadership, teachers, and teaching affairs. Subsequently, the meeting announced and discussed the plan to attach the cultural classes to complete primary schools and adopted the preliminary established learning discipline and system. The class also convened the appointed teachers, introducing them to the situation of the Party Committee School, the educational plan, the students' level, and past teaching methods. When classes started, the students saw that the classrooms, desks, and all equipment were different from before. This formal learning environment greatly encouraged the students' enthusiasm for learning. The teachers also felt that teaching cadres was a glorious task, so they were very serious and responsible. Under the principle of not hindering the complete primary school courses, many teachers were able to squeeze out more time to carefully prepare for the cultural classes. A week after the start of classes, some teachers saw that some students arrived early, and voluntarily offered to arrive fifteen minutes earlier to exchange opinions with the students and answer individual questions. The teachers' seriousness and responsibility greatly encouraged the students. The past phenomena of lateness and absenteeism gradually decreased, and there were no more instances of dozing off, laughing, or making noise during lectures.

    The Chaoyang County Education Committee decided to attach the cadre cultural classes to both middle and complete primary schools. Teachers from the two schools were selected to help cadres with their cultural studies without affecting their teaching time. Since November, it has been stipulated that the learning time is from 12:00 to 1:00 every day, which has greatly improved the students' enthusiasm for learning.

### 机关文化补习班附设于中小学校　辽东朝阳试行获成绩

　　机关文化补习班附设于中小学校
　  辽东朝阳试行获成绩
    【本报讯】为克服机关干部文化学习的师资困难，中共辽东省委、热河朝阳县学委会决定将其所设机关干部文化补习班附设于各当地中、小学，并已获得初步成绩。辽东省委机关学校文化班、朝阳县机关干部文化补习班，自七、十月间建立以来，学习都未搞好。其主要的原因是由于教员都是在职干部，离开学校已久、功课已感到生疏，加上本职工作较忙，讲课准备不充分，不独教学效率不高，而且不免有迟到、缺席的事情。此外干部工作时常调动，部分课程经常换教员，甚至空课，形成泥乱现象。学员的学习情绪也受了影响，发生缺课现象，
    针对着以上现象，辽东省委机关学校在省委宣传部的指示下，决定将文化班附设于完小，发给教员聘请书，并给以原则上不低于其教小学课程所得分数的报酬。该班在附设前召开了一次全体学员的动员会，检讨了过去领导上的缺点，接受了全体学员给领导上、教员及教务上所提的意见；接着，会议宣布并讨论了文化班附设于完小的计划及通过初步制定的学习纪律及制度。该班并召集了所聘的教员，介绍以机关学校的情况，教育计划、学员水平及以往教学方法等。开课时，学员见到学校的教室、桌凳及一切设备和前不同。这种正规的学习环境，大大鼓励了学员的学习情绪。教员也感到教干部是个光荣的任务，因而都很认真负责。许多教员在不妨害完小课程的原则下，都能挤出较多的时间，认真准备文化班的课程。开课后一个星期，有的教员看到有的学员提前到校，便主动提出早到十五分钟，以便与学员交换意见和回答个别问题。教员的认真负责，给学员以莫大的鼓舞。学员过去的迟到和缺课等现象逐渐减少了，讲课时的打瞌睡、嘻笑、吵闹等现象也没有了。
    朝阳县学委会决定将机关干部文化补习班附设于中学、完小两校。由两处教员中选出不影响其授课时间的来帮助干部补习文化，自十一月份开始，规定每日上午十二时至一时为学习时间，大大提高了学员的学习情绪。
