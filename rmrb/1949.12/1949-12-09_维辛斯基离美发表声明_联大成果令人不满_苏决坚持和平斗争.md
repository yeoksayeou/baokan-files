　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, New York: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Soviet Foreign Minister, along with members of the Soviet delegation, left New York on December 6th to return to Moscow. Before his departure, Vyshinsky issued the following statement: "The United Nations Organization Broadcasting Department wants me to express my opinion on the results of the just-concluded Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I must say that the Soviet delegation considers these results unsatisfactory. This is because the Assembly refused to support the Soviet Union's proposals aimed at condemning preparations for a new war and strengthening the cause of peace. The cause of peace has therefore suffered a serious blow. Moreover, the Assembly has adopted resolutions that contradict the principles of the United Nations Charter and the fundamental tasks facing the United Nations in consolidating world peace and ensuring the security of all nations. As for the Soviet Union, as is well known, it has consistently and resolutely done everything in its power to fight for peace, in the past, present, and future. I have already spoken about my impressions and made an assessment of the work of the United Nations. I can add one sentence: Upon leaving the United States, I wish the American people happiness and a joyful New Year."

　　维辛斯基离美发表声明
  　联大成果令人不满
  　苏决坚持和平斗争
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：出席联合国第四届大会的苏联代表团团长、苏联外长维辛斯基及苏联代表团人员，已于十二月六日离开纽约返莫斯科。维辛斯基于启程前发表下述声明：“联合国组织广播处要我对正在结束的联合国第四届大会的成果表示意见。我必须说，苏联代表团认为这些结果是不能令人满意的。这是因为大会拒绝支持苏联旨在谴责新战争准备和加强和平事业的建议。和平事业因此遭受了严重的打击。不仅如此，大会通过了一些与联合国宪章的原则相抵触、并与联合国所面临的巩固世界和平与保证各国安全的基本任务相抵触的决议。至于苏联，则如所周知，不论在过去、现在和将来，它都是坚持不渝地、坚决地尽一切力量为和平而斗争。我已经谈过我的印象，作了对联合国工作的估计。我可以添一句话：在离开美国时，我祝美国人民幸福和欢庆新年。”
