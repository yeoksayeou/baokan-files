　　Popularizing Rural Education
    Shi Ming
    We must win in all aspects. Politics and military affairs have basically triumphed, but our education is far from keeping up with the development of this new situation, and rural education is even worse. In order to welcome the great New Democratic construction, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates the implementation of universal education in a planned and step-by-step manner. We must attach great importance to this new decision with great historical significance, especially those engaged in cultural and educational work, and treat it with a serious attitude.

    To smoothly carry out the work of popularizing education, education must first truly serve the people. Rural education must directly serve the rural people.

    I. Adapt to Local Conditions and Times
    The rural population is generally scattered, unlike the concentration in cities. However, even within rural areas, there are differences due to different regions. Regions can be roughly divided into three types: mountainous areas, semi-mountainous areas, and plains areas. The plains areas mostly consist of large or medium-sized villages with concentrated populations and convenient transportation. Therefore, it is generally advisable to run centralized schools. The villages in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas are mainly small and medium-sized villages, with relatively dispersed or very dispersed populations and rugged mountain roads, making transportation inconvenient. Therefore, it is advisable to run schools in a decentralized manner or in a small, centralized form. We must oppose the method of "one approach fits all" and adapt to local conditions and times.

    Based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and times, school forms should be diversified. For example, in the rural areas of the former Northwest Liberated Area, the population was generally dispersed. However, some were very dispersed, some were relatively dispersed, and a few were relatively concentrated. In this situation, many different forms of education were created. They can be roughly classified as follows:

    First, ordinary primary schools. Children study in school all day. They are established in all counties, with more in cities and large villages. The number of students varies from place to place, with some schools having fifty or sixty students, some special ones having four or five hundred, and most having around twenty or thirty.

    Second, seasonal schools. These are divided into spring schools and winter schools. This belongs to the form of social education. In the Northwest region, around the winter and spring seasons of the old lunar calendar, the weather is cold, agricultural work is not busy, and many rural areas have the traditional custom of setting up winter schools. Therefore, the government opens a large number of them at this time, and many students enroll, with a significant number of young men and women.

    Third, temporary schools. These are divided into morning schools, night schools, half-day schools, literacy groups, etc. These are all social education forms established according to the characteristics of the dispersed population and to take care of the production needs of farmers. Their organization is very common.

    These forms are supported by the people, and everyone praises their convenience. They can be used as a reference for other regions.

    II. The Education System Should Be Flexible
    The length of schooling should be appropriately stipulated. The length of schooling in cities can be longer, while the length of schooling in rural areas should be shorter. The Soviet Union adopted this method, which I think is quite suitable. In addition, it can be handled flexibly depending on the economic and cultural situation. In terms of social education, if the situation permits, the length of study should be determined according to the different characteristics of urban and rural areas. Otherwise, it is enough to set a general requirement (such as how many characters to be literate, or to what extent arithmetic or pen calculation should be learned).

    In terms of holidays, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region once adopted annual leave, busy season leave (autumn harvest and summer harvest leave), and summer vacation. The weekly system also varied, with some adopting the seven-day week system and others adopting the market day system (mostly used in town and village primary schools, where children go home to help with production on market days) to facilitate mass production. This method of stipulating holiday systems according to specific circumstances is worth promoting.

    III. Teaching Guidelines Closely Linked to Reality
    Teaching must be linked to the current specific political tasks in rural areas. For example, in the old liberated areas that have undergone land reform, the main task of the people at present is to strengthen production and improve culture. Then primary schools should focus on culture and teach some production knowledge while teaching culture. Some primary schools should pay more attention to the education of children's basic knowledge in preparation for improvement. The current general social education should focus on teaching production struggle knowledge, and then teach culture on this basis. If production has developed to a certain extent, then culture should be the focus, and teaching should be linked to production knowledge.

    Soviet children's education is carried out in coordination with schools, families, and society. Children spend part of their time in school and part of their time at home. Therefore, the teaching of teachers alone is not enough, and the cooperation of family education is necessary. Their parents often maintain the prestige of teachers, arouse children's respect for teachers, and stimulate their hard work in learning. We have also used this method, and it should be greatly promoted.

    Soviet children's education is also linked to social activities. Urban primary schools often visit factories and workshops, while rural primary schools often go to collective farms to study, cultivating children's love for labor. This spirit is worthy of emulation by our rural children's education workers.

    Teaching from near to far is also an important method of Soviet education for children. They teach knowledge that is specifically related to children's lives, which is easy for children to understand and digest. When teaching subjects such as geography, they start with the local situation, then move to the district, the county, the province, then to the whole country, and even the whole world, gradually improving children's knowledge. I think this principle applies not only to children's education but also to adult and youth social education. In the Northwest Liberated Area, the following methods were used to teach adults and young people to learn culture: first, they learned from their own surnames, names, and the names of their own villages, followed by the New Hundred Family Surnames; farmers learned miscellaneous characters related to crops; small businessmen learned abacus, accounting, and writing receipts; women learned needlework and maternal and child hygiene, etc. This approach was very effective.

    IV. Strengthen Ideological Education
    Ideological education is very important and should be carried out in a planned way in both newly and old liberated rural schools. Ideological education is more important in new areas than in old areas, and more important for adults and young people than for children.

    Soviet ideological education is combined with various scientific and professional education. Ideological education is carried out through the teaching of subjects such as Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, and nature. Ideological education is not only the responsibility of education leaders, but also the duty of every teacher. This educational principle can be our model. Under this principle, the following ideological education should be carried out.

    Our rural education, whether primary school or social education, should emphasize the ideological education of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving science, loving labor, loving public property, and internationalism. The five loves are explained as follows:

    Love the Motherland: Our New Democratic country is the people's own country, which is different from the old China of the past reactionaries. It has just been born, the reactionaries have not been completely eliminated, and American imperialism is still helping the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren reactionary bandits, and at the same time conspiring to provoke a new world war. Therefore, rural education must constantly make the people understand that the new country is the people's own country, and the prosperity of the motherland is their own happiness. Inspire the people to love the motherland and solemnly accept Chairman Mao's call to the people of the whole country: raise vigilance and not allow imperialism to invade our land.

    Love the People: Strengthen the unity between workers, between farmers, and between workers and farmers. The working class is the leader, and the brothers of workers and peasants are the most numerous in the Chinese population. If these most numerous people love each other, help each other, and unite like steel, then any difficulties will inevitably be crushed by them. And only on this basis can we unite the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic people to carry out the construction of New Democracy. Rural education workers must constantly educate children to know the greatness of workers and peasants and love them. They must also actively promote the idea that farmers should love workers and workers should love farmers. Everyone should work together to make great contributions to the motherland.

    Love Science: Our people have suffered thousands of years of feudal oppression and hundreds of years of imperialist oppression. Feudalism, superstition, and backwardness have deeply bound the people's minds. To build a new China, we must promote science. A wave of learning science should be created among the people of the whole country, so that in the cultural upsurge after the economic construction upsurge, the people's minds can be completely turned over.

    Love Labor: Being able to actively participate in a cause of building a new country is a concrete manifestation of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving public property, and loving labor. Rural schools should warmly promote to the people: work hard in production and increase harvests. And educate children to love labor, recognize that labor is the noblest, often visit and participate in some social production activities, and develop labor habits.

    Love Public Property: Now the country is the people's own country, and the people should take the attitude of masters to cherish the property of their own country, and strive to produce in order to actively expand the wealth of the country.

    Strengthen the education of internationalism: promote the idea that workers all over the world are one family, farmers all over the world are one family, and workers and farmers all over the world are one family. Constantly report to the people the situation of the Soviet Union loving the Chinese people and actively helping our country's construction. Inspire the masses to love the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and closely follow the old brother and move forward.

    V. Material Forces to Complete the Educational Task
    The demand for teachers in rural areas has always exceeded the supply. Therefore, when implementing universal education, this issue must first be studied. I think everyone needs to pay attention to rural education, improve the social status of teachers, and care about their various lives. Our Party and our government attach great importance to this work, and the problem is that the lower-level leading organs and comrades who are engaged in education work should thoroughly implement it.

    Under the care of the Soviet government, the teachers in the country enthusiastically teach students and have made great contributions in the history of education. Many of them are rewarded every year for their meritorious service, and they have won the respect and support of the people. The Soviet people often say that teachers are their "guides and friends." Many teachers have been elected to government agencies because of the people's respect and support.

    Our rural teachers should especially remember this very vivid situation. To make others value themselves, they must first value themselves. Serve the children of rural people wholeheartedly. If the work is done well, it will naturally be respected and supported by the people.

    It is very important to set up normal schools, improve the quality of teachers in a planned way, and cultivate new forces in large numbers. If the scattered intellectuals in rural areas can be appropriately concentrated, given short-term training and transformation, it can also solve a big problem. This should be carried out in a planned way.

    Popularizing education is a very extensive undertaking. It is not enough to rely solely on hiring teachers. It is necessary to call on literate people in local organs, troops, and organizations to concurrently handle local people's social education work, and advocate that those who are literate in the masses teach those who are illiterate, those who know many characters teach those who know few characters, sons teach fathers, daughters teach mothers, and younger brothers teach older brothers, so that everyone can gather firewood and raise the flames high.

    Finally, the focus of implementing education is: from the plains to the mountains, from the towns to the villages. Attach importance to the popularization of education in towns and villages, take care of large villages, and gradually pay attention to the education of various rural areas. Strengthen the leadership of primary schools and steadily promote social education.

    Schools can be run by the government, reward private schooling, and run jointly by the government and the people. Do a good job in public primary schools, develop private schools in large quantities, and set up public schools or schools jointly run by the government and the people in places where the people's strength is not enough. This is a good division of labor that can give play to the strength of all parties and should not be ignored. However, whether it is a private school or a school jointly run by the government and the people, it must work under the New Democratic education policy and be led by the local government.

　　普及农村教育
    史  明
    我们要在一切方面胜利。政治、军事基本上胜利了，但是我们的教育事业，还远远赶不上这个新形势的发展，农村教育更差。为了迎接伟大的新民主主义建设，人民政协共同纲领上规定有计划有步骤地实行普及教育。对于这一新的有伟大历史意义的决定，我们要十分重视，特别是从事文化教育工作的人们，更要用严肃的态度对待。
    要顺利进行普及教育工作，必先要教育真正作到为人民服务。农村教育要直接为农村人民服务。
    一，因地因时制宜
    农村人口一般地分散，不象城市集中。然而，就是农村，也会因地区不同而有别。地区大致可分山区、半山区和平原区三种。平原地带多系大村或中村，人口集中，交通便利，因而，一般地宜办集中的学校。山区和半山区的村庄，主要的是小村和中村，人口比较分散或很分散，山路崎岖，交通不便，因而，办学校宜分散，或用小集中的形式。反对采用“一个行情到处使”的办法，要因地因时制宜。
    依据因地因时制宜的原则，学校形式宜采取多样化。例如：原西北解放区的农村，一般地分散。但有的十分分散，有的较分散，有少数的却比较集中。在此情况下，就创造出许多不同的教育形式。大体上可分类如下：
    第一，普通小学。儿童整日在校读书。各县都有设立，城市和大村较多。学生人数各地不一，多的每校五、六十名，特殊的四、五百，一般的在二、三十名左右。
    其次，季节学校。有春学冬学之分。这是属于社会教育的形式。西北地区，旧历冬春之际，天气冷，农事不忙，加之许多农村有设立冬学的传统习惯，因而政府届时大批开办，入学的很多，男女青年占不少数量。
    再次，时校。分早校、夜学、半日校、识字组等。这都是按人口分散的特点，并照顾农民的生产需要而设立的社会教育形式。其组织很普遍。
    这些形式，得到人民的拥护，大家交口称便。可供各地参考。
    二，教育制度要灵活
    要适当地规定学制。城市学制可长些，农村要短些。苏联就采用此办法，我以为颇适宜。另外还可视经济文化的情况而变通办理。社会教育方面，在情况许可下，需按城乡不同的特点，规定或长或短的学习期限。否则，定一个大致的要求（如识字多少，珠算或笔算学到什么程度等）也就够了。
    在假期上，陕甘宁边区曾采用年假、忙假（秋收和夏收假）和暑假。星期制也不一，有的采七天礼拜制，有的取集日制（多行于城镇小学，集日那天儿童回家帮生产），以便于群众生产。这种按具体情况规定假期制度的方法，值得提倡的。
    三，教学方针紧密地联系实际
    教学要与农村当前的具体的政治任务相联系。譬如，经过土地革命的老区，人民目前主要的任务是：加强生产，提高文化。那么小学就要以文化为主，并从教文化上教若干生产知识。有些小学，要多注意儿童的基础知识的教育，以备提高。目前一般的社会教育中应以教生产斗争知识为主，并在此基础上教文化。倘生产已发展到一定程度，则应以文化为主，并联系生产知识的教育。
    苏联的儿童教育，是学校、家庭和社会配合起来进行的。儿童一部分时间在学校，一部分时间在家庭，因而只有教员的教学是不够的，必须有家庭教育的配合。他们的家长，经常维护教员的威信，引起儿童对教员的尊敬，激发其努力学习。此方法我们也用过，宜大大发扬。
    苏联儿童教育，还与社会活动联系。城市小学经常到工厂、作坊中参观，农村的则常去集体农庄学习，养成儿童热爱劳动的习惯。此种精神，值得我们的农村儿童教育工作者效法的。
    教学由近及远，也是苏联教育儿童的一个重要方法。他们教的是与儿童生活有具体联系的知识，孩子们容易懂，容易消化。在教地理等课时，由本地情况教起，到区、到县、到省、然后到全国，乃至全世界，这样来逐渐提高儿童知识。我以为这个原则，既适用于儿童教育，也适用于成年和青年的社会教育。西北解放区，曾用以下方法，教成年和青年学文化：先从他们自己的姓氏、名字、本村村名等学起，继之以新百家姓；庄稼人念庄稼杂字；小商人学算盘，学记帐，学打条据；妇女们学针针线线、学妇婴卫生等。如此进行，收效很大。
    四，加强思想教育
    思想教育很重要，无论新老解放的农村学校，都要有计划地进行。新区思想教育比老区重要，成年和青年的比儿童的重要。
    苏联思想教育是和各种科学的、业务的教育结合在一起的。从国文、算术、历史、地理、自然等教学中，进行思想教育；思想教育不单是教育领导者的责任，而且是每个教员的义务。这种教育原则，可为我们的楷模。应在此原则下，进行下列思想教育。
    我们的农村教育，不论小学或社会教育，都要强调爱祖国、爱人民、爱科学、爱劳动、爱公共财产、和国际主义的思想教育。五爱解释如下：
    爱祖国：我们新民主主义国家，是人民自己的国家，与过去反动派的旧中国不同。它刚刚诞生，反动派还未完全被消灭，美帝国主义还帮助蒋李反动匪帮，同时又阴谋挑动世界新战争。因此，农村教育要经常使人民了解新国家是人民自己的国家，祖国的繁荣，就是自己的幸福。激发人民热爱祖国，并严肃地接受毛主席对全国人民的号召：提高警惕，不让帝国主义侵略我们的国土。
    爱人民：加强工人之间，农民之间，以及工农之间的团结。工人阶级是领导者，工农两兄弟是中国人口的最多数，这最多数人民友爱、互助、团结地象钢铁一样，那么任何困难都必然被他们粉碎。并且也才能以此为基础，很好的团结小资产阶级，民族资产阶级，以及其他爱国民主人士，一道进行新民主主义的建设。农村教育工作者要经常教育儿童知道工人和农民的伟大处，并热爱他们。又要积极宣传农民要爱工人，工人要爱农民的思想。大家同心一德，为祖国立大功。
    爱科学：我国人民受几千年封建压迫，百年帝国主义压迫，封建、迷信落后深深束缚着人民思想，要建设新中国，就要提倡科学，应在全国人民中造成学习科学的热潮，以便在经济建设热潮之后的文化高潮中，使人民思想彻底翻身。
    爱劳动：能积极地参加建设新国家的一项事业，就是热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱公共财产、热爱劳动的具体表现。农村学校要热烈地向人民宣传：努力生产，增加收成。并教育儿童嗜爱劳动，认识劳动是最高尚的，经常参观和参加一些社会的生产活动，养成劳动习惯。
    爱公共财产：现在国家是人民自己的国家，教育人民对自己国家的财产，应采取主人翁的姿态爱护它，并为积极扩大国家财富，而努力生产。
    加强国际主义的教育：宣传天下工人一家人，天下农民一家人，天下工农一家人的思想。经常向人民报导苏联热爱中国人民，并积极帮助我国建设的情形。启发群众热爱苏联，向苏联学习，紧紧地跟在老大哥的后面前进。
    五，完成教育任务的物质力量
    农村的教师向来就是供不应求的，因而，实施普及教育之时，首先要研究此问题。我觉得需要大家重视农村教育，提高教师社会地位，关心他们的各种生活。我们党，我们政府都重视这个工作，问题是要下层领导机关，和作教育工作的同志好好贯彻下去。
    在苏联政府关心之下，其国内的教师们热心教导学生，在教育史上立下很大功勋。他们因有功勋而每年受奖的非常的多，并且博得人民的尊敬和拥护。苏联人民常说：教员就是他们的“向导人和朋友”。许多教员由于人民的敬仰和拥护而被选到政府机关去了。
    这个很生动的情况，我们的农村教师要特别记取的。要人家重视自己，首先要自己重视自己。实心实意地为农村人民的子女服务。工作做好了，自然会受到人民大众的敬仰和拥护的。
    开办师范学校很重要，有计划地提高教员的质量，并大批地培养新生力量。如果能够把农村游散的知识分子适当地集中起来，加以短期的训练和改造，也能解决很大问题的。这要有计划地进行。
    普及教育是一件极广泛的事业，专靠聘请教员还不行，必须号召地方机关、部队和团体内的识字人，兼办当地的人民社会教育工作，并提倡群众中识字的教不识字的，认字多的教认字少的，儿子教爸爸，女儿教妈妈，弟弟教哥哥，方能收大家拾柴火焰高之效。
    最后，实施教育的重点是：由平原到山区，由城镇到乡村。重视市镇普及教育工作，照顾大村庄，并逐渐地注重各个农村的教育。加强小学的领导，稳步地推行社会教育。
    学校可采取政府主办和奖励私人兴学，以及政民合办的形式进行。搞好公立小学，大量的开展私人办学，在人民力量不够的地方，设立公校或政民合办的学校。这是一个很好的分工，可以发挥各方面的力量，不可不重视。但不论民校或政民合办，均须在新民主主义教育方针下进行工作，并受当地政府的领导。
