　　Achievements in Popular Education in Lüda
    Dong Chun-cai
    Recently, we visited Lüda to inspect educational work and to visit Soviet schools, in order to learn from the Soviet Union and improve our school work. After the inspection, we believe that Lüda has made achievements in popular education. Currently, every village in the region has at least one primary school, and 85.4% of school-age children are enrolled. In Lüshun, the phenomenon of out-of-school children has been basically eliminated. What is even more worth reporting is the literacy campaign in the region. Lüda originally planned to eliminate illiteracy in two years, that is, in the cities, illiterate people between the ages of 15 and 45 must learn to recognize 1,200 characters, and in the countryside, they must learn to recognize 1,000 characters. In the past ten months, the region has universally established a literacy network. In the cities, each neighborhood has established literacy schools (night schools and noon schools) and literacy groups. In the countryside, each village has established cultural stations, launching a widespread literacy campaign. From the cities to the countryside, a mass learning upsurge has formed. There are more than 370,000 illiterate people in Lüda, and currently more than 200,070 people are participating in literacy programs (accounting for more than 60% of the total). Most of them have learned to recognize about 500 characters, and the least have learned to recognize 100 to 200 characters. The most have learned to recognize more than 1,000 characters. The following initial results have been achieved:
    (1) Some people have learned to read newspapers, read popular books, learn to keep accounts, write letters, write notes, and write simple daily applied writing such as intelligence reports.
    (2) Superstition has decreased. Some ordinary people, after becoming literate, do not ask witch doctors when they are sick, but go to school to ask for solutions and find doctors.
    (3) Political awareness and production enthusiasm have been improved. After the masses become literate, it is easier to understand and accept the policies of the People's Government. For example, Lüshun responded to the call of "tilling three times and weeding four times." The masses also have a further understanding of the Soviet Union; cheating the Soviet army when doing small business has also been greatly reduced.
    (4) Guaranteed the smooth completion of other tasks. Government proclamations and decrees can be promptly and quickly publicized and mobilized through cultural learning organizations such as literacy schools and cultural stations. Work such as grain requisition and anti-espionage has been done in this way, with great results.
    (5) Training of cadres. For example, after the Dalian City Dock Workers' Union launched a literacy campaign, a cleaning worker, who had learned 1,000 characters in seven or eight months, was promoted to warehouse manager. The "Workers' Home" run by the Transportation Company opened a short-term specialized training class and trained 47 cadres.
    (6) Laid the foundation for technical learning. For example, the Dalian City Dock Workers' Union had organized technical training classes several times before, but they could not be established because illiterate people had difficulty learning technology. Recently, because the workers became literate, technical training classes have also been established.
    The Lüda region has now initially established a cultural network: the highest-level organization is the Cultural Palace (Dalian City has established a Cultural Palace), which mainly cooperates with cadres in government offices to study and hold various lectures and reports. Below the Cultural Palace is the Cultural Center. Cultural centers have been established in various districts and counties of Dalian City, mainly to organize the learning and cultural and recreational activities of neighborhood cadres and the masses. Below the Cultural Center is the Cultural Club. Cultural clubs have been established in various neighborhoods and factories in the city, responsible for leading literacy schools and holding cultural and recreational activities. In the countryside, cultural clubs have been established in various districts, responsible for leading cultural stations. At present, all levels of organizations in this cultural network, except for the cultural club work in cities and villages which is relatively less, the rest are working, and the most active and intense are the cultural station literacy schools and literacy movement.
    The success of the Lüda literacy movement is primarily due to the fact that the people's economy in the region has achieved some recovery and development (it is said that agricultural production has exceeded the Japanese rule era, and industrial production has also recovered to a certain extent). In addition to this, there are two basic factors:
    (1) The Party and government leadership attaches great importance to it. The Lüda CPC District Committee attaches great importance to the work of eliminating illiteracy and improving culture, and is closely monitoring this work. The Literacy Movement Committee and the Cultural Palace Working Committee are working under the direct leadership of the District Committee. The Soviet Union sent two experts to help formulate a plan for establishing a cultural network and a two-year plan for eliminating illiteracy.
    (2) Implemented Chairman Mao's educational thought of "mobilizing the people to educate themselves." The problem of teachers in the Lüda literacy movement is mainly solved by relying on the masses, that is, the masses first select and recommend literate people from their own ranks to be teachers, followed by school teachers and students. The most popular now are the "mass teachers" selected by the masses themselves.
    The funds for the literacy movement are obtained through donations, a total of 500 million Dalian currency has been raised, which is enough to maintain expenses for two years.
    At the beginning of the literacy movement, some places had problems with coercion and commandism, which were promptly corrected. The current shortcomings are three insufficiencies: (1) workers are not as good as farmers, (2) men are not as good as women, and (3) cadres and party members are not as good as the masses. The reason why workers are not as good as farmers: workers are too busy with production, and some factories often work overtime, that is, in addition to eight hours of work, work overtime for two to four hours (according to Dalian's recent inspection, the efficiency of overtime production is not high, because the workers' physical strength cannot support it.) Furthermore, workers have many meetings, and the trade union does not pay enough attention to the literacy movement and does not monitor it closely enough. The reason why men are not as good as women is that there are fewer illiterate men and women are more idle. The reason why cadres and party members are not as good as the masses is that cadres and party members are busier with work and do not pay enough attention to literacy.
    In summary, according to their estimation, judging from the current situation, the Lüda two-year plan to eliminate illiteracy can basically be completed.

　　旅大普及教育的成绩
    董纯才
    最近我们曾去旅大视查教育工作与参观苏联学校，以便学习苏联改进我们的学校工作。视查后我们认为旅大的普及教育是有成绩的。现在该地区每村至少有一个小学，学龄儿童已有百分之八十五点四入学，在旅顺已基本上消灭了失学儿童的现象。更值得报告的，是该地区的识字运动。旅大原计划两年消灭文盲，即在城市里，十五岁至四十五岁的文盲，须识一千二百字，在乡村里，须识一千字。十个月来，该地区已普遍地建立了一个识字网，在城市里，各闾坊都办有识字学校（夜校与午校）和识字组，在农村里，各村都设有文化站，展开了一个广泛的识字运动，从城市到农村，形成了一个群众的学习热潮。全旅大共有三十七万余文盲，目前参加识字的已达二十万七十余人（占总数百分之六十多），其中多数人已学会认五百字左右，最少的认一二百字。顶多的认一千字以上。目前已初步获得如下的效果：
    （一）部分人已学会读报。看通俗书，学会记帐，写信，开条子，写情报等简单日常应用文。
    （二）迷信减少。有些老百姓识字后生病不请跳大神，而去学校问办法，找医生。
    （三）提高了政治觉悟与生产积极性。群众识字后，更容易了解和接受人民政府的政策。如旅顺都响应了“趟三，锄四”的号召。群众对苏联也有了进一步的认识；做小生意的欺骗苏军的事情也大大减少了。
    （四）保证了其他工作的顺利完成。政府颂布决定和法令，可以通过识字学校和文化站这种文化学习组织，及时地迅速地进行宣传动员，传播开去，如征粮、防奸等工作，都是这样做的，收效很大。
    （五）培养干部。如大连市码头工会开展识字运动后，有个清扫工人，在七八个月中识了一千字，就被提拔为仓库管理员。交通公司办的“工人之家”开了一个短期专修班，就训练出了四十七个干部。
    （六）为技术学习打下基础。如大连市码头工会，以前几次办技术训练班，都办不起来，原因是文盲学技术有困难。最近因为工人识了字，技术训练班也办起来了。
    旅大地区目前已初步建立了一个文化网：最上层的组织是文化宫（大连市办了一个文化宫），主要是配合机关在职干部学习，举办各种讲演报告。文化宫之下，是文化馆。在大连市各区和各县，都建立起文化馆，主要是组织闾坊干部与群众的学习及文化娱乐活动。在文化馆之下，是文化俱乐部。城市各闾与各工厂都建立有文化俱乐部，负责领导识字学校与举办文化娱乐活动。在乡村里，各区都建立文化俱乐部，负责领导文化站。目前这个文化网的各层组织，除城市和乡村的文化俱乐部工作较少之外，其余都有工作，最活跃紧张的是文化站识字学校识字运动。
    旅大识字运运获得成功的原因，首先是该地区人民经济已获得若干恢复与发展（据说农业生产已超过日本统治时代，工业生产也恢复到了一定程度），除此之外，还有两个基本因素：
    （１）党政领导的重视。旅大中共区党委很重视消灭文盲提高文化的工作，对这工作抓的很紧。识字运动委员会与文化宫工作委员会，都是在区党委直接领导之下进行工作的。苏联曾派来两个专家帮助制订建立文化网方案与两年消灭盲的计划。
    （２）贯彻了毛主席的“发动人民自己教育自己”的教育思想。旅大识字运动的教员问题，主要是依靠群众解决，即由群众首先从自己队伍中物色推选识字的人来当教师，其次才是学校的教员与学生。现在最受欢迎的是群众自选的“群众教师”
    识字运动的经费，是由募捐得来的，总共募集了五万万大连币，足够维持两年的开支。
    在识字运动开始时，有些地方发生了强迫命令的毛病，已及时被纠正了，目前的缺点是三不如：（一）工人不如农民，（二）男人不如女人，（三）干部党员不如群众。工人不如农民的原因：工人生产太忙，有些工厂时常加班，即在八小时工作之外，加班二至四小时（根据大连最近检查加班生产效率并不高，因为工人体力支持不了。）再就是工人开会多，和工会对识字运动不够重视，抓的不紧。男人不如女人的原因，是男子文盲较少，和妇女较闲。干部党员不如群众的原因，是干部党员工作较忙和对识字重视不够。
    总起来说，据他们估计，就目前情况看来，旅大两年消灭文盲的计划，基本上是可以完成的。
