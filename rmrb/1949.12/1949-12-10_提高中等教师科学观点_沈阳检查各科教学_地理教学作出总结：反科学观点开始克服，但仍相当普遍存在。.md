　　Raising Intermediate Teachers' Scientific Viewpoints
  　Shenyang Inspects Teaching in All Subjects
    Geography Teaching Makes Summary: Anti-Scientific Viewpoints Begin to be Overcome, but Still Quite Prevalent.
    [This Newspaper Reported] The Shenyang Municipal People's Government has recently launched an inspection of teaching in secondary schools across all subjects, with the aim of improving the quality of teachers and reforming teaching methods. The inspection began with geography lessons. The method of inspection was: to organize geography teachers to attend each other's classes in rotation and to hold public teaching sessions. The results of the inspection showed that geography teaching has improved compared to the past, mainly manifested in the fact that the erroneous teaching method of "reading directly from the textbook" has begun to be overcome. Some teachers have begun to regard the natural environment as an interconnected whole and have paid attention to the relationship between the natural environment and production activities. This avoids the problem of turning living geographical knowledge into dead dogma. In the past, under erroneous teaching methods, a complete region was broken down into fragmented pieces, and students could only obtain fragmented, isolated, and abstract and tedious concepts of "terrain," "climate," "mountains," and "rivers." Now, students are beginning to acquire scientific geographical knowledge.
    However, there are still significant shortcomings in current geography teaching. The most important is that the vast majority of teachers still maintain many unscientific viewpoints. For example, when some teachers talk about China's transportation situation, they draw a line on the map of China from Manzhouli in the north to Tengchong in the south, saying that transportation is developed to the southeast of the line and blocked to the northwest, which is caused by the natural environment. They completely ignore the semi-colonial nature of China's transportation development, attributing the decisive role of human life to geography and the natural environment, and denying the reasons for social economy and politics. Furthermore, many teachers still emphasize that China's natural environment is suitable for developing agriculture, without pointing out the social conditions that have made China a backward agricultural country and the broad and bright future of China's industrialization. At the summary meeting on geography teaching, the Education Bureau analyzed many examples of ideological errors existing among geography teachers and pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the ideological nature of teaching work. In the future, geography should be taught to students as a science, so that students can acquire basic knowledge of geographical science, inspire students' love for the motherland, educate students to understand the correct relationship between human society and the natural environment, establish the idea that labor creates the world and that humans conquer nature, correctly understand the relationship between China and the world, educate students with internationalist ideas, and enable students to acquire production knowledge related to geography.

　　提高中等教师科学观点
  　沈阳检查各科教学
    地理教学作出总结：反科学观点开始克服，但仍相当普遍存在。
    【本报讯】沈阳市人民政府顷展开中等学校各科教学检查，借以提高师资水平改进教学。检查首自地理课开始。检查的方法是：组织地理教师互相轮流听课及举行公开教学。检查结果说明，地理教学已较过去改进，主要表现在“照本宣读”的错误教学方法已开始克服，有些教员已将自然环境看成一个联系的整体，并已注意到自然环境与生产活动的关系，这就避免了把活的地理知识变成死教条的毛病。而在过去错误教学方法下，把一个完整的地区分解得支离破碎，学生仅能得到一些片断的、孤立的、抽象的“地势”、“气候”、“山脉”、“河流”等等的繁琐概念；现在，学生则开始能够得到科学的地理知识。
    但是，目前地理教学尚存在很大缺点，最主要的是绝大多数教员仍保持着很多违反科学的观点。如某些教员讲中国交通情况时，将中国地图北自满洲里南至腾冲昼一线，说线之东南交通发达，线之西北交通阻塞，系天然环境造成，而根本无视中国交通发展之半殖民地性，将人类生活之决定作用归诸地理和自然环境，否认了社会经济和政治的原因。又如很多教员还强调中国自然环境适于发展农业，而不指出造成中国为落后农业国的社会条件，和今后中国的工业化广大光辉的前途。在地理教学总结会上，教育局分析了存在于地理教员中许多思想观点上的错误实例以后，指出必须加强教学工作中的思想性，今后应把地理当作科学教给学生，使学生获得地理科学的基本知识，启发学生爱祖国的思想，教育学生对于人类社会与自然环境正确关系的理解，建立劳动创造世界、人类征服自然的思想，正确认识中国与世界关系，用国际主义思想教育学生，使学生获得有关地理方面的生产知识。
