Learning from Our Soviet Sisters
—An Introduction to the Soviet Pavilion at the Asian Workers' and Women's Life and Struggle Exhibition
Bai Sheng

Behind Zhongshan Hall, a magnificent hall is arranged as the Soviet Women’s Life and Work Exhibition Hall. Here, photographs and explanations are used to systematically introduce the life of Soviet women and their participation in socialist construction. On the left side of the hall, a "Soviet Women's Gifts to Chinese Women Exhibition Room" has been opened. The precious and abundant gifts not only convey the enthusiasm and friendship of Soviet women towards Chinese women, but also provide a more intimate and vivid introduction to their lives.

(1) Happy Soviet Women

With excitement and joy, I walked into the exhibition hall. When I saw the photos and explanations of how Soviet women enjoy equal rights with men in participating in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the country, a strong force attracted me, making me feel that this is the real happiness of women, this is the most ideal country, and only women in socialist countries can truly enjoy all this happiness. This is also the hope and direction of struggle for women all over the world.

In the Soviet Union, there are female politicians, female scientists, female writers, female artists who are famous throughout the country and even the world.... From the displayed photos and explanations, we can see that 108 Soviet women were elected as ministers, deputy ministers, and directors of various government departments, and 277 outstanding women were elected as representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. These figures illustrate that today, under the Soviet regime, Soviet women have gained equal status with men in society, and all the oppression and restrictions on women in the ancient Tsarist era have completely disappeared here today. This right of Soviet women is enshrined in the Stalin Constitution.

In the process of socialist competition to implement the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule, the Soviet Union has seen 280,000 outstanding female engineers, technicians, and skilled workers. Millions of Soviet women have mastered complex production technologies, and they receive equal pay for equal work with men. In the exhibition photos, I saw many Soviet women who have won Stalin Prizes and various medals on the production front. A woman named Mishenna, she is an outstanding female driver of the Moscow underground tram. Initially, she was a technician on the electrical duty, and later promoted to the tram dispatcher. Due to her continuous efforts and learning in her work, she has exceeded the execution plan, received awards, and was honorably appointed as a first-class driver. Therefore, the government attaches great importance to her. Similarly, many Soviet female workers have shown a high degree of creativity and initiative in the production sector. They are constantly working hard to improve themselves. After work, they often go to the cultural palace reading rooms in the factories to read books. Many female workers have attended technical night schools.

In the vast rural areas of the Soviet Union, the collective farm system has cultivated many outstanding women production innovators in socialist agriculture. At present, 15,000 women in the Soviet Union serve as chairpersons of collective farms, and hundreds of thousands of women have mastered advanced agricultural technologies. They happily drive tractors and harvesters on the farms, and work diligently for abundant harvests and the development of animal husbandry. Hundreds of thousands of collective farm women have received medals. This is as the great Marshal Stalin said: "Only collective farm life can make labor a glorious fact... and improve the status of women."

In a photo of Soviet children enthusiastically presenting flowers to an old female teacher, I seemed to see many Soviet female teachers who also insisted on working in the field of cultural education. It was a vivid photo of Comrade Liaojishika, a female teacher who had been teaching for 53 years and had been awarded the Red Banner of Labor Medal. Of the 1.2 million primary school teachers in the Soviet Union, female teachers account for 1 million, and they have all served for many years. At the same time, we can also see many women who are dedicated to scientific research in the Academy of Sciences or research institutes, as well as female doctors of surgery and internal medicine. One hundred and sixty-two Soviet women have made great achievements in science and technology inventions, and 136 have shown outstanding talent in literature and art.

In no country in the world do mothers enjoy the respect of society and the protection of the law as much as Soviet mothers. All mothers can receive health checkups and protection from doctors during pregnancy and childbirth. From the first week of pregnancy, they are regularly diagnosed by doctors. During childbirth, they can enjoy seventy-seven days of paid leave and recuperation rights. The Soviet government also rewards mothers who raise the most children, giving them the titles and medals of "Mother Heroine" and "Mother's Glory." At the same time, in order to help mothers and family education, the state has opened thousands of nurseries and kindergartens, so that mothers can work and study with peace of mind.

(2) Precious Gifts

Following the exhibition room, in another hall, there were abundant and precious gifts from Soviet women to Chinese women and Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people.

Those exquisite Soviet silk flower tapestries, carpets, woolen cushions, gold-thread embroidery, lacquer portraits, and ethnic costumes from the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Tashkent Uzbekistan, etc., all show the characteristics of national life. On many tapestries, Soviet women intricately weave images of Stalin, which shows how much they love and respect the great leader. Among the many precious gifts in the room, there was an exquisite set of Soviet chess given to Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, by the women's circles of Moscow, and a set of chess furniture decorated with colored gold and red lacquer. There is a beautiful small table with a chessboard painted on the tabletop and four chairs. This is not an ordinary gift, and this gift also shows the Soviet women's lofty love and concern for the great people's leader of China. They are deeply concerned about Chairman Mao's health and life. In another corner, I also saw "Hoholoma" style children's wooden toys given to Chinese mothers and children by the women's circles of Moscow, as well as many works by Soviet female writers with personal inscriptions given to female writers of the People's Republic of China.... All this seems so exquisite and full of internationalist love.

　　向苏联的姊妹们学习
    ——亚洲工人妇女生活与斗争展览苏联馆介绍
    柏  生
    中山堂后面布置得极其辉煌的一间大厅，是苏联妇女生活与工作的展览馆。这里是用照片与说明有系统地介绍苏联妇女生活与参加社会主义建设的情形。大厅的左侧开辟了一个“苏联妇女赠送中国妇女礼品展览室”，珍贵丰满的礼品，不仅道出了苏联妇女对中国妇女的热情与友谊，同时把她们的生活也做了更亲切更生动的介绍。
    （一）幸福的苏联妇女
    带着兴奋与愉快，我走进了展览馆。当我看到苏联妇女在参加国家的政治、经济、文化各方面都享有与男子平等的权利的那些照片和说明后，一股强大的力量吸引着我，使我感觉到这才是妇女真的幸福，这才是最理想的国度，也只有社会主义国家的妇女才能真正享受到这美满的一切。这也就是全世界妇女的希望和奋斗的方向。
    在苏联，有全国甚至全世界著名的女政治家、女科学家、女作家、女艺术家……。从陈列的照片与说明中，我们可以看到有一百零八位苏联妇女当选了政府各部部长、副部长、署长，有二百七十七位优秀妇女被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。这些数目字说明了今天在苏维埃的政权下，苏联妇女在社会上已经获得了与男子同等的地位，那些古老的帝俄时代的一切，对妇女的压迫与限制，今天在这里已经完全地看不到了。苏联妇女的这种权利是载在斯大林宪法上的。
    在为提前执行战后五年计划社会主义的竞赛进程中，苏联已经出现了二十八万优秀的女工程师、技师和技工，数百万的苏联妇女已掌握复杂的生产技术，她们与男子一样的同劳同酬。在展览的照片中，我看到了许多苏联的妇女在生产战线上，获得了斯大林奖金和各种奖章。一位叫做密申娜的妇女，她是莫斯科地下电车的一位出色的女司机，最初她是电力值班的一个技士，后来升为电车支配员，由于工作中的不断努力与学习，她曾超过了执行计划，得到奖赏，并被荣任为一等司机师。因此，政府对她是十分看重的。同样地，许多苏联女工，在生产部门中都表现了高度的创造性与积极性，她们不断的在工作中努力提高自己，在下工后，她们经常到工厂中的文化宫读书室里看书，许多女工都上了技术夜校。
    在苏联广大的农村中，由于集体农庄制度培养了许多社会主义农业底优秀妇女生产革新者。目前，苏联有一万五千妇女充当了集体农庄的主席，数十万的妇女已经掌握了先进的农业技术，她们愉快的在农场中驾驶着拖拉机、收割机，为了丰富的收成与牧畜的发展，她们勤劳地工作着。几十万的集体农庄妇女得到了勋章。这正如伟大的斯大林大元帅说的：“只有集体农庄生活才能使劳动成为光荣事实……及提高妇女地位。”
    在一张苏联儿童热烈献花给一位老的女教师的照片上，我仿佛看到了多少个同样坚持在文化教育工作岗位上的苏联女教师，那是受到了红旗勋章的教学五十三年的女教员僚吉什佧的一张生动照片。在苏联一百二十万小学教员中，女教员即占了一百万，她们都是服务年代很久的。同时，更可以看到有不少在科学院或研究所中专心致志进行科学研究工作的妇女和外科内科的女医生。有一百六十二位苏联妇女在科学及技术发明上有了伟大的建树，有一百三十六人在文学与艺术上表现了卓越的天才。
    在世界上任何国家中，没有象苏联的母亲们那亲享受着社会上的尊敬和法律上的保护，所有的母亲在怀孕和生产期间，都可得到医生的健康检查和保护，从发现怀孕的第一个星期起，即经常有医生来给她们诊断，在生产期间，她们可以享有七十七天的保留工资和休养权利，苏联政府还奖励那些养育孩子最多的母亲们，给她们以“母亲英雄”和“母亲光荣”的称号和勋章。同时国家为了帮助母亲和家庭教育，开办了成千上万的托儿所和幼稚园，使母亲们能安心地参加工作和学习。
    （二）珍贵的礼物
    顺着展览室走去，另一间大厅中，布置着苏联妇女送给中国妇女、及中国人民领袖毛主席的丰满珍贵的礼物。
    那些精致的苏联绸花墙毯、地毯、毛织枕垫、金线绣品、烤漆像，以及乌克兰、吉尔吉斯、塔什克乌兹别克等苏联加盟共和国赠送给中国妇女的民族衣饰，这些礼品都表现出民族生活的特色。在许多墙毯上，苏联妇女精细地编织着斯大林的像，这显示着她们对伟大的领袖是如何的热爱与尊敬。在满室珍贵的礼品中，有莫斯科妇女界赠给中国人民领袖毛主席的一付精致的苏联象棋，和一套彩色金红漆油饰的下棋家具。有一张桌面上画着棋盘的精美的小桌子和四张椅子。这不是一件寻常的礼物，这礼物也正显示出苏联妇女对中国伟大的人民领袖的崇高热爱与关切，她们深深地关心着毛主席的健康与生活。在另外的一个角落里，我还看到了莫斯科妇女界赠送给中国母亲们与孩子们的“霍贺劳木”式的儿童木器玩具，还有苏联女作家赠送给中华人民共和国女作家们的亲笔题字的许多著作，……这一切都显得是那么精致，充满国际主义的热爱。
