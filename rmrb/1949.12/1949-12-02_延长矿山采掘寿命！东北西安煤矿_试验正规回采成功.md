　　Extending Mine Service Life! Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine
　　Successful Trial of Regular Mining Method

　　[This Dispatch] The Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine has successfully trialed a retreat-style, strip-filled, layered mining method using regular mining techniques.

　　In the past, the general mining method used in Northeast thick-seam coal mines involved blasting and roof-caving. This method not only resulted in high casualty rates and unstable output, but also a low recovery rate, generally around 25 percent, with a maximum of no more than 50 percent. A large amount of underground coal was abandoned, and prone to spontaneous combustion, posing a constant threat of serious accidents within the mine, resulting in incalculable waste of national wealth. In order to overcome the above phenomena, the Xi'an Coal Mine, after a year of research and experimentation, successfully developed a retreat-style, strip-filled, layered regular mining method, extending the service life of thick-seam coal mines by one to three times.

　　Regular mining has many advantages. First, the recovery rate is high, generally above 80 percent, and can reach over 90 percent at its highest. Second, due to layered mining, the goaf is filled with topsoil, maintaining the safety of the working face. Accidents such as spontaneous combustion and roof collapse can be greatly reduced, and casualties can also be reduced accordingly, while output can be maintained normally. Third, the mining tunnels are regular, ventilation is convenient, gas is not easily present, and the possibility of explosion is low. Fourth, the working faces are concentrated, facilitating management, maximizing the effectiveness of machinery, and facilitating scientific division of labor. The disadvantage is that ground pressure cannot be utilized, and when the coal quality becomes hard, the amount of explosives required increases; the working face is concentrated over a long area, with many workers, and if there is a fault, it immediately affects the entire working face. During the year of experimentation, the following experience was gained: because workers were accustomed to irregular mining methods, they were unfamiliar with the new method and initially found it difficult to accept. However, after education and explanation of the benefits of regular mining, and after a period of experimentation, it was accepted by everyone, and the efficiency of coal mining was greatly improved. According to regulations, each person produced three tons per day; in May, it reached three tons, and in June, it reached 3.9 tons, with some units reaching more than four tons. For example, the West Eighth Road of the Taixin Mine No. 1 increased from two tons to three tons to 3.5 tons per worker, and finally reached 4.8 tons, with further improvement expected. This is the first point. Secondly, when implementing regular mining, it is necessary to select appropriate workplaces to avoid worker morale being low and losing confidence. Technical leaders should fully understand the situation and make correct plans; technical personnel should also go to the site at any time to provide guidance. For example, the technicians of the Taixin Mine often went to the site, and if the spacing of the sand walls did not meet the specifications, they provided on-site guidance, and immediately pointed out any uncleaned loose coal on the roof. Therefore, the regular mining of the West Eighth Road of the Taixin Mine No. 1 was the most successful. Furthermore, the division of labor must be clear and a dedicated responsibility system must be implemented. Only in this way can workers become proficient earlier. Thirdly, large-scale mining must have sufficient transportation capacity. Generally, electric chutes should be installed in the working face to ensure supply.

### 延长矿山采掘寿命！东北西安煤矿  试验正规回采成功

　　延长矿山采掘寿命！东北西安煤矿
    试验正规回采成功
    【本报讯】东北西安煤矿试验后退式带状充填分层采煤的正规回采法获成功。
    东北厚煤层矿山，过去一般的采掘方式，都利用打冒顶，进行采煤，此种方式，不但伤亡大，产量不正常，而回采率又太低，大都在百分之二十五，最高也不过百分之五十。地下的煤炭，遗弃得很多，且易自然发火，随时有酿成坑内严重事故的可能，因而造成国家财富无法计算的浪费。为克服上述现象，西安煤矿经过一年的研究试验，后退式带状充填分层采煤的正规采法，得到成功，使厚煤层的矿山在采掘寿命上，延长了一倍至三倍。
    正规回采优点很多。一、回采率高，一般都在百分之八十以上，最高可达百分之九十以上。二、由于分层回采，前面采过的空场子就由顶石充填了，就保持了掌子的安全，自然发火与冒顶等事故，就可大大减少，伤亡亦可随之减少，而产量可因此保持正常。三、回采坑道正规，通风便利，瓦斯不易存在，爆发可能性少。四、场子集中，便于管理，机械能充分发挥效能，易于科学分工。缺点是不能利用地压，且煤质变硬时，需要火药量增大；场子集中幅度长，工作人员多，若有故障，马上就影响全场子。在一年的试验中得到了这样的体验，即职工因作惯了非正规采煤法，对于新方法不熟练，最初不易接受，但经教育与说明正规回采的好处，并经过一段试验过程，才为大家所接受，采煤的效率也大为提高。按规定每人日产三吨，五月份达到三吨，六月份达到三吨九，有的单位达到四吨多。如泰信矿一坑西八路，每工由二吨而三吨而三吨五，最终达到四吨八，预计还能提高，此其一。其次试行正规回采时，须选择适当工作场所，以免工人情绪低落，失掉了信心。技术领导干部，要充分了解情况，作出正确计划；技术人员更应随时亲往指导，如泰信矿技师，常到现场去，砂墙子间隔不合规格，就当场指导，挑顶煤末采净，也立即指出。所以泰信矿一坑西八路的正规回采，最为成功。再有就是分工要明确，实行专责制，只有这样才能更早熟练。其三，大量的回采，必须有足够的运搬力，一般场子，要安装电溜子，才能供应上。
