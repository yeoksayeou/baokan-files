Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th: The Asian Women's Representative Conference continued its discussion on the report "Protecting the Rights of Asian Women" on the morning of the 14th. Speakers included Daw Thin Thin from Burma, Li Wenyi from China, Heo Te from Korea, Victoria Er Haylu from Lebanon, and Wait from Thailand. The representatives unanimously agreed that only by completely defeating imperialism and its running dogs in Asia can women obtain rights and freedom.

	Burma
	Burmese representative Daw Thin Thin said: After Japan surrendered, British imperialism returned to Burma, and all the rights of Burmese women were deprived. However, Burmese women are unwilling to endure a life of slavery. They actively participate in strikes and bravely participate in armed struggles. Under the leadership of the All Burma Women's Conference, they are fighting together against British imperialism and its running dog Ba Swe.

	China
	Chinese representative Li Wenyi, after describing the deprivation of women's rights during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, said: The people's democratic dictatorship after liberation is a fortress defending the rights of all the people, including women. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also stipulates the rights of women. These provisions have begun to be realized. However, the acquisition of these rights has gone through a long struggle. The most important experiences that Chinese women have learned in the long struggle can be summarized into two points: (1) The women's liberation movement must be closely integrated with the revolutionary movement to strive for national independence and people's democracy. (2) The key to women's attainment of equal social status with men under the people's regime is labor production and economic independence.

	Korea
	Korean representative Heo Te passionately said: After I joined the guerrilla隊, my parents and my three young brothers were all killed by the enemy. This bloody fact is endless in southern Korea. The women in southern Korea have experienced from the actual struggle of the past four years that women will never have true rights under the rule of American imperialism and its running dog Syngman Rhee. Therefore, they bravely participated in the guerrilla war and fought to the end to eliminate American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee regime that deprive women of their rights.

	Lebanon
	Victoria Er Haylu, when talking about the miserable situation of Lebanese women, said: The wages of female workers are decreasing day by day, and the number of unemployed people is constantly increasing. The lives of peasant women are extremely poor. They live in wooden sheds like cattle and horses. Their housework is just a torn blanket or a broken straw mat. They are fighting against the Lebanese reactionary government for their urgent rights.

	Thailand
	Thai representative Wait said that although Thailand is a famous rice-producing area, the Thai people and women have no rice to eat and live a painful life of starvation. The lives of female workers are even more tragic, working twelve to fourteen hours a day, but their wages are only half of those of male workers. Peasant women are forced to take up arms to resist the reactionary government's encirclement and suppression forces. The organization of democratic women in Thailand has been devastated and has had to go underground to carry out its struggle.

	India
	During the discussion of the report on protecting the rights of Asian women on the 13th, speakers included Indian representative Mira Mitru, Mongolian representative Dolongma Java, and Soviet representative Ashia Atanipesova. Mira Mitru said that under the rule of British imperialism and its running dog Nehru, the wages of Indian workers are already pitifully low, but the wages of female workers are even lower, only half or one-third of those of male workers. Pregnant women are kicked out of factories when they cannot work. Only two percent of women in India are literate. Indian mothers often die from childbirth. In 1942 alone, 200,000 people died from childbirth.

	Mongolia
	Mongolian representative Dolongma Java pointed out in her speech: Before the Mongolian People's Revolution, Mongolian women did not have any political rights. They lived a life of slavery, and none of them were literate. Since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution with the help of the Soviet people in 1921, Mongolian women have begun a new life and have obtained unprecedented rights in political, economic, and cultural aspects.

	Soviet Union
	Ashia Atanipesova said: In the Soviet Union, women are free and equal. Their economic status is solid. Their living standards are constantly improving, and a brilliant prospect of material and cultural wealth reaching abundance day by day has been unfolded before them. In any economic sector in the victorious socialist country, Soviet women hold important and competent positions. One hundred and eight women serve as ministers, deputy ministers, and bureau directors. In the Asian Soviet republics, three or four ministries are headed by women. Women have played an unparalleled role in rural areas and have achieved brilliant achievements. Thanks to the care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, Soviet mothers, while engaged in political and social activities, are still able to fulfill their responsibilities as mothers and educate their children well. Soviet women will never forget the difficult situation of their sisters in Asian countries. They sincerely sympathize with and warmly support the liberation struggle of oppressed sisters.

	Guests
	At the conference on the 14th, West African guest Madame Eugene, American guest Ada Jackson, and Cuban guest Edith Garsibuka also spoke. American guest Ada Jackson said: "The American Women's Conference knows that American tycoons and military men are planning to drag the world into a new war; we know that as progressive Americans, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to fight against these plans. We will do this, and do it very successfully."

　　讨论“保护亚洲妇女权利报告”
  　各国代表来宾发言摘要
    【新华社北京十四日电】亚洲妇女代表会议十四日上午继续讨论关于“保护亚洲妇女权利”的报告。发言的计有缅甸代表多丁定，中国代表李文宜，朝鲜代表许铁，黎巴嫩代表维多利亚·爱尔·海露，泰国代表魏特。各代表一致认为只有把在亚洲的帝国主义及其走狗们完全击溃以后，妇女们才能得到权利，才能获得自由。
    缅甸
    缅甸代表多丁定说：日本投降以后，英帝国主义者又回到缅甸，缅甸妇女的一切权利都被剥夺了。但是缅甸妇女决不愿忍受奴隶的生活，她们积极地参加罢工，英勇地参加武装斗争，她们在全缅甸妇女大会的领导下共同为反对英帝及其走狗达钦努而奋斗。
    中国
    中国代表李文宜在叙述了国民党反动政府统治时期妇女的权利被剥夺的情形之后，说：解放以后的人民民主专政，是保卫包括妇女在内的全国人民的权利的堡垒。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领对于妇女权利亦有规定。这些规定，已在开始实现。但是这种权利的获得，是经过了长期的斗争的。中国妇女在长期斗争中体会到的经验归纳起来最主要的有两点：（一）妇女解放运动，必须和争取民族独立、人民民主的革命运动紧紧结合起来。（二）在人民政权下妇女取得与男子平等的社会地位的关键，是劳动生产，经济独立。
    朝鲜
    朝鲜代表许铁激昂地说：我参加游击队以后，我的父母和我的年幼的三个弟弟全被敌人杀掉了。这个血腥事实，在朝鲜南部是层出不穷的。我们朝鲜南部的妇女们从四年来的实际斗争中体验了在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚的统治下，妇女决不会有真正的权利。所以他们奋勇地参加了游击战争，为消灭剥夺妇女权利的美帝国主义和李承晚统治而斗争到底。
    黎巴嫩
    维多利亚·爱尔·海露在谈到黎巴嫩妇女所处的悲惨地位时说：女工们的工资日见降低，失业人数不断增加。农妇们的生活，穷困不堪，她们和牛马一样地住在木棚里，她们的家务就是一条破毛毡或破草席，她们为了自身迫切的权利，正和黎巴嫩反动政府作斗争。
    泰国
    泰国代表魏特说，泰国虽然是一个著名的产米地区，但是泰国人民和妇女没有米吃，过着饥饿的痛苦的生活。女工们的生活，更是悲惨，每天工作到十二至十四小时，工资却只有男工的一半。农妇们被迫拿起武器，反抗反动政府的进剿部队。泰国民主妇女的组织受到了摧残，不得不转入地下进行斗争。
    印度
    在十三日讨论保护亚洲妇女权利的报告时，发言的有印度代表米拉·米脱鲁，蒙古代表多龙玛贾娃，苏联代表阿希亚·阿塔尼佩索娃。米拉·米脱鲁说，在英帝国主义及其走狗尼赫鲁的统治下，印度工人的工资已低微得可怜，但女工的工资比男工更低，只有男工的一半或三分之一。怀孕的妇女不能工作时，即被赶出工厂。全印度只有百分之二的妇女是识字的。印度的母亲们常因分娩致死，一九四二年一年中因分娩致死的就有二十万人。
    蒙古
    蒙古代表多龙玛贾娃在发言中指出：在蒙古人民革命以前，蒙古妇女没有任何的政治权利，她们过着奴隶生活，她们没有一个是识字的。自从一九二一年苏联人民帮助蒙古人民革命胜利以后，蒙古妇女才开始新的生活，并在政治、经济和文化各方面得到前所未有的权利。
    苏联
    阿希亚·阿塔尼佩索娃说：在苏联，妇女是自由平等的。她们的经济地位是巩固的。她们的生活水平不断在提高，在她们面前已展开了物质和文化财富一天天达到丰饶而灿烂的远景。在胜利的社会主义国家内的任何经济部门里，都有苏联妇女来担当重要而胜任的职务。有一○八个妇女作了部长、副部长和局长，在亚洲的各苏维埃共和国里有三四个部，是由妇女当首长的。妇女们在农村里更发挥了无比的力量，获得了辉煌的成就。由于共产党和苏维埃政府的关怀，苏维埃的母亲们虽然从事政治和社会活动，还能够很好地担负起作母亲的责任来教育自己的孩子。苏联妇女永远不会忘记，她们的在亚洲各国的姊妹们是处在怎样一种艰难的境地。她们衷心地同情并热烈地支援被压迫的姊妹们的解放斗争。
    来宾
    在十四日，大会上，西非来宾欧仁夫人，美国来宾阿达·杰克逊和古巴来宾爱底斯·加西布加卡亦曾讲话。美国来宾阿达·杰克逊说：“美国妇女大会知道美国的大亨们和军人们正在策划把世界卷入一次新的战争；我们知道，作为进步的美国人，我们有责任要尽我们的一切力量，为反对这些计划而战斗。我们要这样做，而且把它做得很成功。”
