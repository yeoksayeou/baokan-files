Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 13th—TASS reports from Sofia on the 10th that the Bulgarian Supreme Court, trying the treason case, heard the testimony of the defendant Ivan Dzheferenov, former Director of the Rubber Industry Department of the Ministry of Industry, on the morning of the 9th. Dzheferenov pleaded guilty completely. Dzheferenov came from a wealthy peasant family and was a major industrialist. Dzheferenov had known the defendant Ivan Stefanov for a long time. Their common hatred for the proletarian revolution bound them together. In July 1946, Stefanov told Dzheferenov about the existence of the treasonous center and its goals and tasks. Dzheferenov confessed: "Stefanov told me that he was inviting me to participate in rebellious activities on Kostov's instructions. I first met Kostov in November 1944, when I, along with Ukasandzhev, Nipoliev, and Kiril Slavov, members of the Central Committee of the Manufacturers Association, met him at the Party Central Committee. When we left the Central Committee, we talked on the way about our impressions of the meeting. Nipoliev, Ukasandzhev, and Slavov said that Kostov was a person who shared our views. Previously, I had heard our industrialists talk about the same impression of Kostov. Many of them said, 'If all the Communists were like Kostov, then all of us industrialists would become Communists too.'" (Laughter from the audience in the courtroom)
The evidence shows that Stefanov had presented Dzheferenov with two tasks: to engage in work to dampen the spirits of the Communist members of the Manufacturers Association, and to recruit more people to participate in rebellious activities. In this way, Ukasandzhev and Mikhail Dzherasimov, who worked in the Ministry of Industry, were also drawn into the conspiracy.
Dzheferenov continued to confess about his subversive activities in Bulgaria. Slavov ordered and directed him in this regard. Others who were similarly ordered and directed by Slavov included Asronian of the Timber Industry Association, Stoyan Tvyakelier of the Canned Goods Industry Association, and Dimiter Stopyanov of the Woodworking Industry Association. Dzheferenov admitted that as a result of his subversive activities in the rubber industry, the "Bakish" factory produced 850,000 fewer pairs of shoes and 2,000 fewer tires than planned. The same thing happened in other rubber factories.
In the autumn of 1947, following Slavov's instructions, the defendant Dzheferenov issued special survey forms to all industrial enterprises, which required detailed information about the location, production capacity, and industrial characteristics of all enterprises. Dzheferenov sent these materials to Slavov, who then provided them to British intelligence.
Dzheferenov confessed: "After the nationalization of industry, sabotage activities intensified. Following Petko Kunin's instructions, in order to damage the reputation of nationalization, I closed some profitable factories and left those that were not profitable open. Following my instructions, the equipment of factories and plants that were not operating was dismantled. When Kostov learned about my activities, he expressed great satisfaction. In July 1948, Stefanov told me that the overthrow of the Dimitrov government and the establishment of a government headed by Kostov was expected to be realized.
Dzheferenov said: Stefanov had a plan to overthrow the Dimitrov government, establish a new government headed by Kostov, break with the Soviet Union, and adopt a political line leaning towards capitalist countries—the United Kingdom and the United States—with which political, diplomatic, and economic ties must be established."
The prosecutor, Vladimir Dimchev, asked: "What else did Stefanov tell you about Kostov's activities at the Central Committee plenary sessions and at the Politburo meetings, and about Kostov's attacks on Dimitrov (which aggravated Dimitrov's illness)?"
Dzheferenov replied: "Stefanov said, 'It would be better if he died; it would save us from killing him.'"
In September 1948, Stefanov ordered Dzheferenov not to leave Sofia, because fundamental changes were expected to occur at the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party, changes that would be favorable to Kostov's supporters and would help them accelerate the realization of their conspiracy objectives.

Trial of Former Yugoslav Embassy Counselor to Bulgaria, Blagoj Hadji-Panzov

The court continued to hear the testimony of the defendant Blagoj Hadji-Panzov, former Counselor of the Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia. The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges against him completely.
Hadji-Panzov confessed: "After graduating from the University of Belgrade, I practiced law in Bar. In 1941, I went to Skopje and lived there, illegally participating in the political struggle in Macedonia. At that time, Tito's people began to arrive in Skopje, attempting to take control of the Macedonian Communist Party (then called the 'Okraina Committee'). These people included Dragan Pavlovic and Lazar Kolisevski, who immediately began a struggle against Metodi Shatorov (i.e., Sharlo), who was then the secretary of the 'Okraina Committee,' saying that Shatorov advocated surrendering to the Bulgarian occupation forces. As a result, Shatorov had to go to Bulgaria, and in 1944 he sacrificed himself as a guerrilla in the Pirin region of Bulgaria." After Shatorov left, the Macedonian Communist Party began a purge. As Hadji-Panzov confessed: supporters of Shatorov were expelled from the party. At that time, Tito's followers who arrived in Macedonia followed an openly hostile bourgeois nationalist policy towards Bulgaria. They began to recruit people with obvious pro-British sentiments into the party. The Macedonian Communist Party was full of anti-Soviet supporters of the bourgeois capitalist system.
Hadji-Panzov continued: "Svetozar Vukmanovic—Tito's secret envoy—arrived in Skopje in 1943, and before that, at the end of 1942, Dobrivoje Radosavljevic, the current Minister of Finance of Yugoslavia, also visited there. Since their arrival, the pro-British sentiments among the officials have become even more blatant. People around Vukmanovic openly declared their support for the United Kingdom. In 1943, following the instructions of the Central Committee and the General Staff of the Macedonian Communist Party, a so-called Initiating Committee was established to establish the Macedonian People's Assembly. The committee consisted of eight members, and I was also a member of this committee. In September 1943, the General Staff, controlled by General Svetozar Vukmanovic (Tempo), issued a declaration emphasizing that the liberation of Macedonia was only possible within Yugoslavia. The Initiating Committee disagreed with this declaration and protested to Vukmanovic's General Staff. Vukmanovic immediately ordered the dissolution of the committee.
"In the spring of 1944, we went to Tempo's headquarters in the village of Stari Ovc of Pcinja River. The first thing that surprised us was that we saw a British military delegation composed of officers, lieutenants, and sergeants, all wearing British military uniforms. British officials were well taken care of in Tempo's headquarters, while the representatives of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Jordanka Zankova, Blagoj Ivanov, and Bai Ivan, were completely isolated. This was ordered by Vukmanovic.
"In July 1944, an American military delegation consisting of two officers and a sergeant came to Vukmanovic's headquarters. When the Americans arrived, the guerrillas began to ask General Tempo: 'Why is there no Soviet delegation here?' In August 1944, according to the decision of the General Staff, I left for the Supreme Headquarters located on Vis Island—Tito was there. On the way to the Serbian General Staff (in Mordinetz, west of Liaskovetz), I saw many British officers. Upon arriving on Vis Island, I found it to be fortified. I also saw twenty to twenty-five British Spitfire aircraft decorated with the Yugoslav flag. I heard that the aircraft were 'given' to Tito by the British to defend Vis Island. There were British and American officers in the city. There were also representatives of the Yugoslav provisional government and the National Liberation Committee—Tito, Djilas, Rankovic, and others. Tito lived in a cave specially built for him outside the city. He rarely left the cave, and when he did, he was always accompanied by Rankovic and a strong guard. Before he came out, martial law would be declared, and no one except those British and American military officers who were often with Tito was allowed to stay on the streets. When the Soviet army crossed the Yugoslav border, Tito's headquarters was in a state of frustration and panic."
Hadji-Panzov further confessed: "In September 1947, Razo Latinovic, Secretary-General of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representative of the State Security Department, told me that I would be appointed as a counselor to the Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia. He also told me that in addition to diplomatic affairs, I would also engage in espionage activities. I received the necessary instructions in this regard. Latinovic told me that I must conduct espionage work in Bulgaria patiently and vigilantly, and that I must be very careful when I secretly meet with agents. I was told that in my espionage work, I would be helped by the fact that Zchimir, the head of the Yugoslav intelligence agency, was stationed in Sofia with the qualifications of Yugoslav ambassador. At the end of March 1948, Zchimir summoned me to his office and told me that the time had come to start working with agents, who until then had been under the command of Pero Mangovski, counselor of the embassy. During my tenure at the Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia, I discovered from various documents that since 1945, immediately after Macedonia and Yugoslavia were liberated, the leaders of Belgrade and Skopje had been engaged in espionage and propaganda activities. After liberation, this activity was carried out by people specially sent to Bulgaria, and later by diplomatic representatives Kiril Miljanovski and Zvita Charyovska—Kolisevski's sister. They received various propaganda materials from Belgrade through diplomatic mail. The main intention of this propaganda was to convince the Bulgarian people and the Macedonians living in Bulgaria that they could only have a happy life after the Pirin region was incorporated into Yugoslavia."
The court continued to hear Hadji-Panzov in the afternoon, and he confessed that the espionage activities in Bulgaria were originally organized by Nikola Kovacevic, the Yugoslav envoy to Bulgaria, counselors Pero Ungurski, First Secretary Mitko Safirovski, and Cultural Counselor Anton Korendic. They engaged in large-scale espionage activities and recruited Dimiter Kristov, the Boyar Chaliyev brothers, Traiko Pop-Dimitrov, and Kiril Nikolov to participate in the work. In 1947, Ilija Milchinov was sent to Bulgaria from Spri, and he was to organize the Macedonian People's Theater in the Pirin region with a group of actors. These "actors" were spies of the Yugoslav intelligence agency. Officials of the Yugoslav State Security Department Ilija Barfvski, Blagoj Petrovski, and Pero Korobar were sent to the Pirin region to direct espionage activities there. In 1948, following the instructions of Yugoslav Ambassador Zchimir, Hadji-Panzov replaced Pero Mangovski, who was recalled to the country, and established contact with Angel Dinev, a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, who intended to provide Hadji-Panzov with political, military, and economic intelligence. According to a letter from Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic, two youth work teams were specially organized in Bulgaria to engage in espionage activities. After receiving the tasks assigned by Haji-Panzov, Angel Dinev traveled to the Bulgarian border area for espionage purposes. In early July 1948, according to Rankovic's order, Hadji-Panzov and Assistant Military Attaché Milatovic gave their agents and spies 15,000 leva each as monthly salaries. Moreover, spies Dimiter Kristov, Kiril Sokolov, and Rukte Gerov received 20,000 leva in remuneration.
Panzov further confessed: "In 1948, when I stayed in Belgrade, the Deputy Minister of the Yugoslav Ministry of Internal Affairs told me that according to the government's decision, I had to leave Belgrade, declare myself an opponent of Tito, and engage in activities among Yugoslav political exiles. After the Cominform's resolution on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was published, Rankovic instructed Angel Dinev to draft a memorandum against the Cominform's resolution and the resolution of the 16th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. When the members of the Central Committee of the Macedonian Cultural and Educational Association did not agree to sign this memorandum, Angel Dinev forced several Yugoslav students to sign the memorandum. Later, the memorandum was handed over to Yugoslav Assistant Military Attaché Milatovic.
"In late March 1948, I learned from Zchimir, the Yugoslav Ambassador to Sofia, about Kostov's anti-people and anti-Soviet activities. Zchimir pointed out that Kostov was engaged in a struggle against the Bulgarian Communist Party leadership headed by Dimitrov. While describing Kostov's activities and pointing out his close ties with Tito and other Yugoslav leaders, Zchimir argued that Kostov's victory in Bulgaria would also have a very favorable impact on Yugoslavia's position. Zchimir told me that if such a victory were achieved, Yugoslavia's prestige would increase immeasurably, and it would become the first country in the Balkans. On the other hand, Kostov's victory would guarantee the closest political and economic ties between us and Bulgaria.
"In fact, all the personnel of the Yugoslav Embassy in Bulgaria were engaged in espionage activities, so the embassy became the Yugoslav intelligence headquarters in Bulgaria."

Ilija Boyarjaliev Pleads Guilty

The court continued to hear Ilija Boyarjaliev. Boyarjaliev pleaded guilty to all charges.
During the war in 1944, someone suggested to him that he join the ranks of the fighters for the people's liberation movement. However, he preferred to serve as an officer in the Bulgarian fascist occupation army.
Boyarjaliev confessed: "In August 1945, I met my brother, Christo Boyarjaliev, Deputy Minister of Trade of the Yugoslav Macedonian Republic, in Gevgelija, Yugoslavia. He wanted me to work for the Yugoslav secret service among Yugoslav and Macedonian political exiles in Sofia. As soon as I returned to Sofia, I carried out espionage work according to the instructions and guidance of Blagoj Hadji-Panzov, Counselor of the Yugoslav Embassy. Active hostile activities were launched among Macedonian and Yugoslav exiles, and they praised Tito. With the help of other agents of Tito, in 1946, I became the Chairman of the Macedonian Cultural and Educational Association in Sofia. At this time, I visited Vardar Macedonia again as a representative to attend the First Congress of the Macedonian People's Front. I saw my brother Christo there again, and he said that espionage and subversive activities must be intensified among Macedonians in Bulgaria, and insisted that the Pirin region be incorporated into Yugoslavia. I returned to Bulgaria and continued my work there until 1948. After the Cominform's resolution on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was published, I met Hadji-Panzov, whom I had known before, at the Yugoslav Embassy. Hadji-Panzov strongly demanded that I do everything possible to discredit the Cominform's resolution in front of the Macedonians, and make them believe in the correctness of Tito's policies. After Hadji-Panzov falsely announced his support for the Cominform's resolution, I established contact with Naum Nakov, an official of the South Embassy, at his suggestion.
"After Naum Nakov was expelled from Bulgaria, Savic, the Minister of the Consular Department of the Yugoslav Embassy in Bulgaria, summoned me to meet him and gave me letters from my brother Christo Boyarjaliev and Naum Nakov. They instructed me to maintain close contact with Savic and continue working. Two weeks later, I was arrested."

Vasil Ivanovski Pleads Guilty

Finally, the defendant Vasil Ivanovski was tried. He pleaded guilty to the charges against him.
The defendant confessed: "During World War II, I came to Skopje Prison. I escaped from prison and joined the guerrillas commanded by General Svetozar Vukmanovic (Tempo). After Tempo was convinced that I was indeed a supporter of Tito, he sent me to work in the Propaganda Department of the General Staff. The purpose of our agitation and propaganda was to cover up the success of the Soviet army as much as possible and conceal its great liberation mission. We praised Tito and exaggerated his role.
"Tito did his best to cultivate party and military cadres with hatred for the people of neighboring countries, especially hatred for brotherly communist parties. Tempo told me more than once that Tito taught them not to trust the communist parties of neighboring countries. Tito told him, 'Don't pay attention to the fact that they are communists.'
"In Skopje, I was the editor of the 'New Macedonia' newspaper. Through this newspaper, I praised Tito and widely introduced his officials—Lazar Kolisevski, Ljubčo Arsov, etc.
"Tito's agents in Macedonia purged those who fought for the interests of the Macedonian people from the ranks of the Macedonian Communist Party. In the spring of 1945, fifty-seven Macedonians accused of sympathizing with the Bulgarian people were shot without trial or investigation. Shortly thereafter, I was summoned by Lazar Kolisevski. He suggested that I go to Bulgaria to work among the Macedonian exiles there. I was instructed to make Sofia my headquarters and seek assistance from a group of sectarianists including Kiril Nikolov and Angel Dinev. My task was to gradually replace the members of the Macedonian National Committee with people who were docile to Skopje and were willing to act as tools for Tito's policies on the Macedonian issue in Bulgaria. I was told to make special efforts to spread our influence in the Pirin region. From this, I learned that the Pirin region would be incorporated into Yugoslavia. I faced the task of launching attacks on the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, especially Vasil Kolarov and Vladimir Poptomov. These two people have consistently adhered to the Bulgarian Communist Party's policy on the Macedonian issue and have openly opposed Tito's plan to incorporate Bulgaria into Yugoslavia. In order to disguise my visit to Bulgaria, a farce was played out in Skopje that I had disagreements with Kolisevski and other leaders of the Macedonian Communist Party. After I came to Bulgaria, I settled in Sofia.
"At first, I worked in the Propaganda Department of the Sofia District Committee of the Party, and later I was transferred to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. I established contact with the leaders of Macedonia and Tito's agents Kiril Nikolov and Angel Dinev, as well as with Mitko Safirovski, the secretary of the Yugoslav Embassy. Through the medium of the small group I formed and through the training classes for educating Macedonian youth, I carried out my sectarian and destructive activities. In my speeches and reports, I promoted Tito's views on incorporating the Pirin region into the Macedonian Republic within Yugoslavia.
"In 1946, I repeatedly reported various remarks and opinions of the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party to Mitko Safirovski orally and in writing. In November 1946, Safirovski told me that he had received information from Nikola Pavlov about the opinions of the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee on the Macedonian issue and the issue of the Southern Slavs Federation. He also said that Ivan Maslarov promised him to help the Macedonian sectarian group to fight against the Macedonian National Committee. Mitko Safirovski told me that Lazar Kolisevski informed him that it was also possible to cooperate with Kostov in this regard, but this matter was not within his jurisdiction. After Safirovski left, I began to receive instructions from his successor Mumsilovic. On the eve of the publication of the Cominform's resolution on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, I received instructions from the Yugoslav Embassy to superficially support the resolution and declare my opposition to Tito. After the Cominform's resolution was published, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party condemned Tito's nationalism and his policy on the Pirin region in its statement. I had been supported by most members of the Macedonian National Committee. When the face of the rebellious Yugoslav leaders headed by Tito had been exposed in front of everyone, I was blamed for my remarks on the issue of the merger of the Pirin region, and I was removed from my work in the Central Committee and the position of Chairman of the Macedonian National Committee. My sabotage plan failed to materialize."
Ivanovski finally said: "I was worried about my safety, and I wanted to escape to Yugoslavia, but my superiors did not allow me to do so. He told me that if necessary, they would find a way to smuggle me out, even against my own will. Unfortunately, the promised assistance did not arrive in time." (Laughter from the audience in the courtroom)
The interrogation of the defendants ended here, and the court will open on the 10th to interrogate witnesses.

　　保利亚叛国案第三日审讯经过
　　伊凡·杰夫列诺夫服罪
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社索罪非亚十日讯：审讯叛国案的保加利亚最高法院九日上午审讯前工业部橡皮工业司司长，被告伊凡·杰夫列诺夫。杰夫列诺夫完全服罪。杰夫列诺夫出身于富农家庭，为大工业家。杰夫列诺夫很久以前就已认识被告伊凡·斯捷法诺夫。他们对无产阶级革命共同的仇恨把他们结合在一起。一九四六年七月斯捷法诺夫把谋叛中心的存在及其目的与任务告诉杰夫列诺夫。杰夫列诺夫供称：“斯捷法诺夫对我说，他按照科斯托夫的训令邀我参加叛逆活动。我和科斯托夫第一次见面是在一九四四年十一月，当时我和制造商协会中央委员会的委员乌卡桑杰夫、尼波利耶夫和基里尔·斯拉沃夫一起在党中委会会见他。当我们离开中委会的时候，我们在路上谈到对这次会谈的印象。尼波利耶夫，乌卡桑杰夫和斯拉沃夫说科斯托夫是和我们声气相通的人。以前我曾听过我们的工业家谈到和这相同的对科斯托夫的印象。他们当中有许多人这样说：“假如所有的共产党人都象科斯托夫那样，那我们所有的工业家也会变成共产党人了。”（法庭上听众大笑）
    从证据中看出：斯捷法诺夫曾向杰夫列诺提出两个任务，这就是从事打击共产党人——制造商协会会员们之情绪的工作，并在他们当招雇更多的人参加叛逆活动。这样乌卡桑杰夫和在工业部工作的米哈尔·杰拉斯莫夫也被拉入谋叛活动之中。
    杰夫列诺夫继又供述其在保加利亚之颠覆活动。斯拉沃夫在这方面命令并指挥他。受斯拉沃夫同样命令和指挥的还有木材工业协会的阿斯罗尼安，罐头工业协会的斯托扬·特维开里耶夫和木工工业协会的季米特尔·斯托普扬诺夫。杰夫列诺夫供认：由于他在橡皮工业中进行颠覆活动的结果，“巴基什”工厂较计划所规定的少生产了八十五万双鞋和两千付车胎。同样的事情也会在其他橡胶工厂中发生。
    一九四七年秋季，遵照斯拉沃夫的训令，被告杰夫列诺夫发出专门的调查表格到所有的工业企业中去，表格中要填上关于所有企业的地点、生产能力、和工业特性的详细材料。杰夫列诺夫把这些材料送交斯拉沃夫，而再由斯拉沃夫把它们提供给英国情报处。
    杰夫列诺夫供称：“在工业国有化以后，怠工破坏活动就更加剧了。遵照彼特科·库宁的训令，为了破坏国有化的声誉，我关闭了一些经营有盈余的工厂而留下了那些不赚钱的工厂。遵照我的训令，不开工的工厂和制造厂的设备都被拆除了。当科斯托夫知道了关于我的这种活动时，他表示非常满意。在一九四八年七月，斯捷法诺夫告诉我说：推翻季米特洛夫政府而成立以科斯托夫为首的政府可望实现。
    杰夫列诺夫说：斯捷法诺夫曾有过这样的计划：推翻季米特洛夫的政府，成立以科斯托夫为首的新政府，和苏联分裂，采取倾向资本主义国家——必须与之建立政治、外交与经济的联系的英国和美国——的政治路线。”
    起诉人乌拉第米尔·第姆切夫问：“关于科斯托夫在中央委员会全体会议和在政治局会议上的活动以及关于科斯托夫攻击季米特洛夫。（其结果加重了季米特洛夫的病势）这几方面，斯捷法诺夫又告诉你些什么？’
    杰夫列诺夫答称：“斯捷法诺夫说：‘假使他死了那就更好了，那就省掉我们杀他了。’”
    一九四八年九月，斯捷法诺夫命令杰夫列诺夫不要离开索非亚，因为在共产党第五次代表大会上可望发生根本的改变，这种改变一定会有利于科斯托夫的支持者并且也一定会有助于他们加速阴谋目的之实现。
　　审讯前南驻保大使馆参事　布拉哥伊　哈德伊—潘佐夫
    法庭继审讯前南斯拉夫驻索非亚大使馆参事、被告布拉哥伊·哈德伊—潘佐夫。被告对于控告他的罪状完全服罪。
    哈德伊—潘佐夫供称：“我自贝尔格莱德大学毕业后，在巴尔经营律师业务。一九四一年我同到斯科普里，就住在该地，非法参加马其顿的政治斗争。当时铁托的人就开始抵达斯科普里，企图把马其顿共产党（当时叫“奥克拉伊尼委员会”）掌握在他们手里。这些人包括德拉干·巴夫罗维奇和拉查尔·科里舍夫斯基，他们立刻开始了反对当时是“奥克拉伊尼委员会”书记的麦佛第·沙塔罗夫（即沙尔罗）的斗争，说沙塔罗夫赞成投降保加利亚占领军。结果沙塔罗夫不得不前赴保加利亚，一九四四年他就在保加利亚彼林区作为一个游击队员而牺牲了。”沙塔罗夫离开之后，马其顿共产党即开始清党。正如哈德伊—潘佐夫所供认的：沙塔罗夫的支持者都被开除出党了。当时抵达马其顿的铁托分子遵循着公开敌视保加利亚的资产阶级民族主义政策。他们开始把有显然亲英情绪的人吸收到党内来。马其顿共产党内尽是资产阶级资本主义制度的反苏支持者。
    哈德伊—潘佐夫继称：“斯维托查·乌克曼诺维奇——铁托的密使于一九四三年抵达斯科普里，而在这以前，即一九四二末南斯拉夫现在任财政部长多布里伏伊·拉多萨夫列维奇也到过那里。自从他们来了之后，官员当中的亲英情绪就更露骨了。围绕在乌克曼诺维奇周围的人就公开声言拥护英国。一九四三年，按照马其顿共产党中委会与参谋总部的训令成立了一个所谓发起委员会，以便成立马其顿人民议会。该委员会由八个委员组成，我也是这个委员会的委员。一九四三年九月在斯维托查·乌克曼诺维奇（特姆波）将军控制下的参谋总部，发表了一个宣言，强调只有在南斯拉夫以内，马其顿的解放才有可能。发起委员不同意这个宣言，于是便向乌克曼诺维奇的参谋总部提出抗议。乌克曼诺维奇立刻下令解散委员会。
    “一九四四年春季，我们前往设在普琴尼亚河畔之斯塔里奥夫茨村中的特姆波的总部。在那里首先使我们大吃一惊的，就是我们看到了校官、尉官和士官所组成的英国军事代表团，他们全穿着英国军服。在特姆波总部中对英国官员照顾得很周到，而保加利亚共产党的代表们约尔丹卡·赞科瓦，布拉哥伊·伊凡诺夫和巴伊·伊凡完全被孤立起来。这是乌克曼诺维奇命令这样作的。
    “一九四四年七月，由两个军官和一个中士所组成的美国军事代表团来到乌克曼诺维奇的总部。当美国人来了的时候，游击队开始问特姆波将军：‘为什么这里没有苏联代表团呢？’在一九四四年八月，按照参谋总部之决定，我离此赴设立维斯岛之最高总部——铁托就在那里。在去塞尔维亚参谋总部（在里阿斯科维茨之西的莫尔丁斯）的途中，我看到了许多英国军官。在抵达维斯岛时，我发现它防卫得很巩固。我又看见了二十——二十五架饰以南斯拉夫国旗的英国喷火式飞机。我听说：飞机是英国‘送’给铁托来保卫维斯岛用的。城里有英美军官。也有南斯拉夫临时政府和民族解放委员会的代表们——铁托、德热拉斯、阑科维奇等人。铁托住在城外特别为他设的窑洞里。他很少离开这个窑洞，要离开的时候他也经常有阑科维奇和强大的卫队陪伴着。在他出来以前，先要戒严，除了时常与铁托在一起的那些英美军事官们以外，任何人不得留在街上。当苏军横越南斯拉夫边境的时候，铁托的总部于沮丧和惊惶之中。”
    哈德伊——潘佐夫进而供称：“一九四七年九月南斯拉夫外交部秘书长兼国家保安处代表拉佐。拉丁哥维奇告诉我说：我将被任命为南斯拉夫驻索非亚大使馆参事。又告诉我说：除了外交事务以外，我还要从事于间谍活动。关于这方面我得了必要的训令。拉丁哥维奇告诉我说：我必须耐心而机警地在保加利亚进行谍报工作并且当我和代理人秘密会晤时一定要非常地小心。我被告诉说：在我的谍报工作中我将因实际上是南斯拉夫谍报机关首脑的兹奇米尔之以南斯拉夫大使资格驻在索非亚这一事实，而得到帮助。一九四八年三月末，兹奇米尔召我至他的办公室并告诉我说：借助于代理人而开始工作的时候已经来到了，直到那时止，这些代理人是受大使馆参事彼罗·曼哥夫斯基指挥的。在我任职于南斯拉夫驻索非亚大使馆期间，我从各种文件中发现：自一九四五年起，即马其顿和南斯拉夫刚被解放以后，贝尔格莱德和斯科普的领袖们就已经从事于间谍与宣传活动。在解放后，这种活动是由专门派到保加利亚的人们进行着，而以后则由外交代表基利尔·米辽夫斯基和兹维塔·查尔约夫斯卡——科利雪夫斯基的姊妹——进行。借着外交邮递之便，他们从贝尔格莱德收到各种宣传材料。这种的宣传的主要意向在于使保加利亚人民和住在保加利亚的马其顿人深信：只有在彼林区并入南斯拉夫以后，他们才有幸福生活可言。”
    法庭下午续审哈德伊——潘佐夫，他供称：在保加利亚的间谍活动，原先是由南斯拉夫驻保公使尼可拉·科瓦西维奇，参事彼罗·昂高尔斯基，一等秘书米特科·萨菲罗夫斯基及文化参赞安东·科连迪奇四人组织的。他们从事于大规模的间谍活动，并把季米特尔·克里斯托夫，波雅尔查利耶夫兄弟，特拉伊科·波普——第弥特罗夫及基利尔·尼科洛夫诸人拉来参加工作。一九四七年，伊利亚·米尔契诺夫被从斯普里派来保加利亚，他和一批演员一道要在彼林区组织马其顿民众剧院。这些“演员们”就是南斯拉夫谍报机关的间谍。南斯拉夫国家保安处的官员伊利亚·巴尔夫斯基，布拉哥伊·彼特罗夫斯基以及彼罗·科罗巴尔被派到彼林区来指挥该地的间谍活动。一九四八年，遵照南斯拉夫大使兹奇米尔的训令，哈德伊—潘佐夫接替了奉召回国的彼罗·曼哥夫斯基的职位，并和保加利亚共产党中央委员安杰尔·迪尼夫建立了联系，迪尼夫拟把政治、军事与经济性的情报供给哈德伊—潘佐夫。按照南斯拉夫外长西米区的手令，专门在保加利亚组织了两个青年工作队，从事间谍活动。安杰尔·迪尼夫在收到哈行伊—潘佐夫所交予的任务之后，即为了间谍目的去保加利亚边境地区游历。在一九四八年七月初，按照兰科维奇的命令，哈德伊—潘佐夫和助理军事武官米拉托维奇给他们的代理人和间谍支取了一万五千利瓦作为月薪。而且，间谍季米特尔·克里斯托夫、基里尔·索科洛夫及鲁克特·杰罗夫取得报酬二万利瓦。
    潘佐夫进一步供称：“一九四八年，当我留在贝尔格莱德时，南斯拉夫内政部副部长告诉我：根据政府的决定我必须离开贝尔格莱德，宣布我自己是铁托的反对者，并在南斯拉夫政治流亡者当中活动。在情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党的决议发表之后，兰科维奇责成安杰尔·迪尼夫起草反对情报局决议和保加利亚共产党中央委员会第十六届全会决议的备忘录。当马其顿文化教育协会中央委员会的委员都不同意签署这个备忘录的时候，安杰尔·迪尼夫迫使数名南斯拉夫学生在这个备忘录上签了字。后来，就把备忘录交给南斯拉夫助理军事武官米拉托维奇。
    “一九四八年三月下旬我从南斯拉夫驻索非亚大使兹奇米尔那里知道科斯托夫的反人民与反苏活动。兹奇米尔指出：科斯托夫已在进行反对以季米特洛夫为首的保加利亚共产党领导机关的斗争。在描述科斯托夫的活动并指出他和铁托及南斯拉夫的其他领袖的密切联系时，兹奇米尔力称：科斯托夫在保加利亚的胜利，对南斯拉夫的地位也会有十分有利的影响。兹奇米尔对我说，假如获得了这样的胜利的话，则南斯拉夫的威信将不可衡量地增长，而且她将成为巴尔干的第一个国家。另一方面，科斯托夫的胜利将保证我们和保加利亚在政治上经济上最密切的联系。
    “实际上南斯拉夫驻保加利亚大使馆的全体人员都从事间谍活动，这么一来，大使馆就成了南斯拉夫驻保加利亚的情报总部。”
　　伊利亚　波雅尔查利耶夫服罪
    法庭继审讯伊利亚·波雅尔查利耶夫。波雅尔查利耶夫对一切控诉都直认不讳。
    他在一九四四年战争期间有人向他建议，参加人民解放运动斗士的行列。然而，他宁愿在保加利亚法西斯占领军那里当军官。
    波雅尔查利耶夫供称：“一九四五年八月我在南斯拉夫的吉维吉里遇到了我的兄弟南斯拉夫马其顿共和国贸易部副部长克利斯托·波雅尔查利耶夫，他要我在索非亚的南斯拉夫和马其顿政治流亡者当中为南斯拉夫特务机关工作。我一返回索非亚便执行南斯拉夫大使馆参事布拉哥伊·哈德伊——潘佐夫的训令与指示进行谍报工作。在马其顿与南斯拉夫的流亡者当中展开了积极的敌视活动并对他们颂扬铁托。由于铁托的其他代理人的帮助，一九四六年，我当了索非亚的马其顿文化与教育协会主席。这时候，以出席马其顿人民阵线的第一次代表大会的代表资格再度访问马其顿的发达尔。我在那里又看到我的兄弟克利斯托，他说，必须在保加利亚的马其顿人当中加紧间谍与颠覆性活动，并坚主彼林区并入南斯拉夫。我回到保加利亚，并在那里继续我的工作直到一九四八年。在情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党的决议发表之后，我就在南斯拉夫大使馆会见我以前认识的哈德伊——潘佐夫。哈德伊—潘佐夫坚决要求我尽一切努力在马其顿人面前底毁情报局的决议，并使他们相信铁托政策的正确。在哈德伊—潘佐夫虚伪地宣布他自己支持情报局的决议之后，我便应他的建议与南大使馆官员瑙姆·纳科夫建立了联系。
    “在瑙姆·纳科夫被驱逐出保加利亚以后，南斯拉夫驻保加利亚大使馆领事部部长萨维奇召我去见他并且交给我从我的兄弟克利斯托·波雅尔查利耶夫和瑙姆·纳科夫来的信。他们嘱咐我和萨维奇保持紧密联系继续工作。两星期后，我便被逮捕了。”
　　华西尔·伊凡诺夫斯基服罪
    最后受审的是被告华西尔·伊凡诺夫斯基。他对所提的控诉服罪。
    被告供称：“在第二次大战期间，我来到斯科普里监狱。我破狱逃出参加了斯维托查·乌克曼诺维奇（特姆波）将军所指挥的游击队。在特姆波深信我确是铁托的拥护者后，他派我到参谋本部宣传鼓动部工作。我们的鼓动和宣传把自己的目的规定为：尽量掩蔽苏军的成功而隐瞒起它那伟大的解放任务。我们颂扬铁托并夸大他的作用。
    “铁托尽最大力量用憎恨邻国人民特别是憎恨兄弟共产党的精神来培养党和军事的干部。特姆波不只一次告诉我说：铁托教给他们不要信任邻国的共产党。铁托告诉他说：“不要注意他们是共产党这件事实”。
    “在斯科普里我任‘新马其顿’报编辑。通过这个报纸，我颂扬铁托和广为介绍他的官员们——拉查尔·科利雪夫斯基，鲁布乔·阿尔索夫等等。
    “铁托在马其顿的代理人把那些为马其顿人民的利益而斗争的人们自马其顿共产党的行列中清除出去。在一九四五年春季，有五十七个被控为对保加利亚人民抱同情心的马其顿人未经审判或调查而被枪决。此后不久，我被拉查尔·科利雪夫斯基召见。他建议我去保加利亚到那里的马其顿流亡者中间去工作。我受到训令是把索非亚做成我的总部并且在包括基利尔·尼科洛夫和安杰尔·迪尼夫的一群宗派主义者中寻求援助。我的任务是逐渐把马其顿民族委员会委员代之以对斯科普利驯服的人们和愿意在保加利亚充当铁托关于马其顿问题所采政策之工具的人们。我被告以特别要努力设法在彼林区散布我们的影响。由此，我得知彼林区将被并故南斯拉夫。我面临着发动攻击保加利亚共产党中央委员会特别要攻击华西尔·科拉罗夫和乌拉第米尔·波普托莫夫的任务。这两个人一贯坚持着保加利亚共产党关于马其顿问题所遵循的并且率直地反对铁托把保加利亚并入南斯夫的计划。为了给我去到保加利亚作掩饰，在斯科普里曾扮演过我和科利雪夫斯基以及马其顿共产党其他领袖们闹意见的活剧。我来到保加利亚后就在索非亚住下来。
    “起初我在党的索非亚区委员会宣传鼓动部工作，后来被调到保加利亚共产党中央委员会宣传鼓动部工作。我与马其顿的领导者们和铁托代理人基利尔·尼科洛夫和安杰尔·迪尼夫，以及与南斯拉夫大使馆的秘书米特科·萨菲罗夫斯基建立了联系。通过我组成的小集团的媒介，通过教育马其顿青年的训练班，我实现了我的宗派主义活动和破坏活动。在我的演说与报告中，我宣传铁托之关于把彼林区并入南斯拉夫境内的马其顿共和国国内的观点。
    “在一九四六年，我曾屡次以口头和局面向米特科·萨菲罗夫斯基报告关于保加利亚共产党领袖们的各种言论与见解。在一九四六年十一月，萨菲罗夫斯基告诉我他已从尼可拉·巴夫洛夫那里得到关于保加利共产党中央委员会各领袖对于马其顿问题和南方斯拉夫人联邦问题之意见的情报。他还说，伊凡·马斯拉罗夫答应他帮助马其顿宗派主义集团对马其顿民族委员会进行斗争。米特科·萨菲罗夫斯基告诉我，拉查尔·科利雪夫斯基通知他说在这方面还可能与科斯托夫合作，但是这件事不在他的职权之内。在萨菲罗夫斯基离开之后，我开始从他的继任者莫姆西洛维奇那里得到训令。在情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党的决议发表的前夕，我收到南斯拉夫大使馆的训令，要表面上赞成决议并宣布我反对铁托。在情报局的决议发表之后，保加利亚共产党中央委员会在它的声明中谴责铁托的民族主义和他对于彼林区的政策。我曾受到马其顿民族委员会大部分委员的支持。当以铁托为首的叛变的南斯拉夫领导者的面目已在每个人面前揭穿了的时候，我已因为我之关于彼林区合并问题的言论受到责难，而且撤消了我在中央委员会的工作和马其顿民族委员会主席的职位。使我的破坏计划未能实现。”
    伊凡诺夫斯基最后说：“我担心我的安全，我想逃到南斯拉夫，但我的上司不允许我这样作。他向我说，如果必要的话，他们会想办法将我偷偷送出，甚至违背我自己的意志。不幸得很，答应的援助并未及时到来。”（法庭上听众大笑）
    被告的审讯至此终结，十日开庭讯问证人。
