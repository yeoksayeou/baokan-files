　　Shijiazhuang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Combines with Specialized Companies to Develop Supply and Marketing Business

[This News Report] The Shijiazhuang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Hebei Province summarized its work last month, and the business operations of the entire special district expanded rapidly. 12,000 new members were developed, and 27 grassroots cooperatives were established. In November, the purchase of homespun cloth, local products, and medicinal materials all exceeded the original plans. The purchase of homespun cloth exceeded the plan by more than double, and the method of exchanging yarn for cloth was adopted to maintain a reasonable ratio between raw materials and finished products. 325,000 jin of local products and medicinal materials were purchased. In terms of supply tasks, compared with October, the ten main items that increased were kerosene, foreign yarn, matches, coal, and edible oil; those that decreased were edible salt, foreign cloth, alkali noodles, and food grain. The reasons for the decrease are mainly the seasonality of the sales of goods, coupled with rising prices. The cooperatives were afraid to let go of business, and their poor management was affected by private merchants. In particular, the county cooperatives concentrated their efforts on collecting cotton, relaxing the management of this business.

In terms of cooperative construction, although the county cooperatives concentrated their efforts on cotton requisition in November, they still achieved certain results in building cooperatives and developing members. A total of 12,000 new members were developed and 27 grassroots cooperatives were established in the entire special district. Furthermore, in Gaocheng and Jin counties, they tried to increase shares from five jin of rice per share to ten jin of rice. Not only did all the old members in Mijiazhuang, Jin County, pay additional shares, but they also developed 31 new members.

The main experience in developing cooperative business is that cooperatives must have sound business operations, adapt to local conditions, cooperate with the production of local people, and, even more, must combine with various specialized companies to jointly develop supply and marketing business, promote homespun cloth and local products, and supply living materials and means of production.

　　石家庄专区供销社结合专业公司开展供销业务
    【本报讯】河北石家庄专区供销总社总结上月工作，全专区业务经营迅速扩大，发展新社员一万二千名，建立基层社二十七处。十一月份土布、山货、药材的收购均超过了原订计划。土布收购超过计划一倍以上，并采用以纱换布方式，保持了原料成品间的合理比价。收购山货药材三十二万五千斤。在供给任务上，以十种主要物品来说比十月份增加的有煤油、洋纱、火柴、煤炭、食油；减少的有食盐、洋布、碱面、食粮等。减少原因，主要是物品销售的季节性，又适逢物价上涨，各社不敢放手经营，及经营不善，受私商影响。特别是因为各县社集中精力征棉，放松了此一业务的经营。
    在建社工作上，十一月份各县社虽然集中力量搞征棉工作，然而建社与发展社员，仍获得一定成绩，全专区共发展新社员一万二千名，建立基层社二十七处。更在藁城、晋县试作增加股金，由五斤米一股增到十斤米，晋县秘家庄不仅旧社员全部增缴了股金，而且还发展了三十一名新社员。
    发展合作社业务的主要经验是：合作社必须有健全的业务经营，因地制宜，配合当地群众的生产，更必须与各专业公司结合起来，共同展开供销业务，推销土布、山货，供给生活资料、生产资料等。
