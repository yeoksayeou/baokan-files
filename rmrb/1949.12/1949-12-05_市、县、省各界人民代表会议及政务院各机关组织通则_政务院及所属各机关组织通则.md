　　市、县、省各界人民代表会议及政务院各机关组织通则         
    政务院及所属各机关组织通则
    【新华社北京四日电】中央人民政府政务院及其所属各机关组织通则。
    （一九四九年十二月二日第九次政务会议修改通过）
    一、政务院及其所属各机关（包括委、部、会、院、署、行、厅等）的组织规程，依据中央人民政府组织法第二十一条之规定统称组织条例。
    二、各机关应依据中央人民政府组织法第十五条、第十八条、第十九条和第二十条，规定其职权。
    三、各机关得设办公厅；为分掌业务，得设司或处；厅、司或处以下得设处或科。其工作有半独立性质者得设局。其工作有特定性质者得设室（如参事室、会计室、资料室）、组（如财经组、文教组）、所（如研究所）或会（如高等教育委员会）。
    四、关于厅、司、处、科、局、室、组、所及会的职掌，应为列举的规定。
    五、各机关的各级负责人，厅及室称主任，会称主任委员，司称司长，局称局长，组称组长，所称所长，处称处长，科称科长，必要时均得设副职。
    六、各委得设秘书长、副秘书长，一般机关均得设秘书。各机关得视工作需要，分别酌设顾问、参事、专门委员、工程师、技师、视察等。
    七、除各委秘书长副秘书长及其他同级人员由政务院提请中央人民政府委员会批准任免外，厅主任、司长、局长、处长、室主任与其副职及其他与以上各职同级人员、均由政务院任免之。厅、司、局、处、室以下之处长，室主任、科长与其副职及其他工作人员，由各机关首长任免，并报告政务院备案。
    八、各机关应实行会议制度（如委务会议、部务会议、会务会议、院务会议等），其所属各部门，亦得分别设各项工作会议。
    九、各机关的内部组织，必要时，得由政务会议议决增加、减少或合并之。
    十、各机关拟定之组织条例，经政务院核准后，可先试行若干时期，再送请中央人民政府委员会批准。
    政务院各机关组织系统表（以部为例）说明：一、内部机构设置之繁简，员额之多寡，应视其工作任务、工作计划、财力与人力定之。
    二、各机关人员职名虽同，职位可不尽同，例如政务院政治法律委员会主任与内务部办公厅主任职名虽同，职位并不相等。
