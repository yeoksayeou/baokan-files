　　Price Fluctuations and Basic Ways to Overcome Them
    Yang Bo
    After the price fluctuations in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places subsided from late July to early August, prices in various regions remained relatively stable for two months. However, starting in mid-to-late October, prices in North China, led by grain, and in Shanghai, led by yarn, began to rise again. By early November, the fluctuations had become drastic. In one month, the average price of yarn in Tianjin increased by 261%, and the price of grain increased by 263%. In Shanghai, the average price of yarn increased by 217%, and the price of rice increased by 231%. This caused a certain degree of disorder in markets across the country, and had a significant impact on the lives of frontline troops and the people nationwide. During this period, the victories of our People's Liberation War were further consolidated and expanded. The area and population under our control increased, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened, the Central People's Government was established, formal diplomatic relations were established with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries, domestic transportation and material exchanges were further restored and developed, and it was also the season for large-scale marketing of agricultural products. Military, political, and economic conditions were all better than they had been two months prior. Why then did prices fluctuate even more than before? Now that prices have fluctuated, can they be stabilized? Now that they have been stabilized, will periodic fluctuations still occur in the future? These questions have become the most pressing concerns of the people nationwide and urgently need to be understood. Here, I will address these questions based on my limited observations, as follows:

    Why are prices rising? The main reasons are:

    (1) First and foremost, the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, resulting in a considerable deficit. Consequently, the amount of currency issued also increases. Why has the nation's expenditure increased so sharply during this period? This is because, in order to meet the needs of liberating all of China, the People's Liberation Army has greatly expanded. The number of former Kuomintang military, government, public, and educational personnel taken over has exceeded one million. The restoration and construction of various production and transportation enterprises requires massive investment. The development of foreign trade, the purchase of native products, and guaranteeing the supply of key industrial raw materials (such as cotton) also require the allocation of huge amounts of trade funds. While all these expenditures are large, they are necessary and are all major and beneficial undertakings related to the fundamental interests of the people, and the government must undertake them. However, on the other hand, the government's revenue has not increased proportionally during the same period. "Many sources of revenue are temporarily stagnant. Tax revenues from newly liberated urban and rural areas are either stagnant due to war and blockade and need to be reorganized and restored, or are subject to seasonal restrictions and cannot be collected temporarily. Investments in restoring production and transportation cannot recover costs in the short term, let alone generate profits." Therefore, under the circumstances where revenue cannot be substantially increased and huge expenditures must be maintained, the government's fiscal issuance must also increase accordingly. This is the fundamental reason for the recent currency devaluation and price increases.

    (2) With the increase in the amount of currency in circulation in the market, market speculation, which had been dormant for a while, has become active again in recent months. This speculative capital engaging in hoarding and creating disturbances in the market is also one of the main reasons for the recent price fluctuations. For example, in the Shanghai market, state-owned trading agencies normally only need to sell about 10,000 dan of rice per month to maintain stable rice prices. However, during this period of price fluctuation, more than 60,000 dan of rice were sold in one month, but the rice price still could not be stabilized. In the Beijing and Tianjin markets, state-owned grain companies normally only account for 20-30% of the total market trading volume, but during the price fluctuations, they often accounted for about 80%. The fact that unscrupulous merchants such as Wang Zhenting, the "grain tiger" in Beijing, refused to sell grain and drove up grain prices during the price increases is clear evidence of this. This greatly increased the government's resistance to stabilizing prices.

    (3) Temporary imbalances in the supply and demand of goods have also had a certain impact on the recent price fluctuations. For example, yarn is currently in the sales season, but due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in allocation, temporary imbalances in supply and demand have occurred in Central China and Northwest China. After the liberation of vast areas of South China, the demand for yarn has also greatly increased. Therefore, in the Shanghai market, which has the largest yarn production in the country, yarn has become the main target of speculation and hoarding in recent months, leading to price increases across various commodities led by yarn. In North China, on the other hand, grain production was lower due to the severe disaster situation this year and the lack of grain in cotton-producing areas. In addition, the temporary interruption of traffic between Beijing and Suiyuan in the previous period to prevent the plague, the obstruction of grain sources from the Northwest, and the smaller amount of grain coming from the Northeast also contributed to a temporary imbalance in grain supply and demand in North China, with prices of various commodities rising under the lead of grain. In addition, state-owned trading agencies also have certain shortcomings in their planned work of adjusting supply and demand and in their timely, rational, and proactive adjustments to the prices of various commodities during this period.

    The above points are the main reasons for the recent price fluctuations. After the price fluctuations occurred, our state-owned trading companies and transportation agencies rushed to transport large quantities of materials such as grain and yarn, and sold them in large quantities to meet the needs of markets across the country. In recent weeks, prices in various regions have begun to fall generally. But does this mean that the price problem has been solved today? No, because the essence of the price problem is a fiscal problem. When the nation's fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, it is difficult to maintain complete price stability. But we must also recognize that our current difficulties are temporary, difficulties in the midst of victory, and can be and are completely solvable, and are fundamentally different from the difficulties of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the process of its demise.

    In order to effectively solve the price problem, prevent inflation, and prevent the recurrence of periodic price fluctuations in the future, we must adopt a "radical" approach today to fundamentally solve the problem.

　　物价波动和克服物价波动的基本办法
    杨  波
    自七月下旬至八月上旬津沪等地的物价波动平息后，继续两月各地物价皆处于相当稳定的状态，但自十月中下旬开始，华北区物价以粮食带头，上海以纱布带头又先后开始上涨，至十一月上旬即剧烈波动，一月来天津纱布价平均上涨了百分之二六一，粮价上涨了百分之二六三，上海纱布价平均上涨了百分之二一七，大米上涨了百分之二三一，引起了各地市场一定程度的紊乱，前线军队及全国人民的生活受到了很大的影响。这一时期我人民解放战争的胜利更加巩固扩大了，地区、人民增加了，人民政治协商会议已召开，中央人民政府成立了，苏联及各新民主国家已与我国建立了正式外交关系，国内交通与物资交流已得到进一步的恢复发展，农产品亦是大量上市季节，军事、政治、经济条件皆比两月前为好，为什么物价反会比以往波动更大呢？物价既已波动，那么能否稳得住？现在稳住了，将来是否仍会发生周期性的波协等问题，即成为当前全国人民最关心亦是急待了解的问题。在此个人特将上述问题，就管见所及分述如下：
    物价为什么上涨呢？其主要原因在于：
    （一）首先在于政府的财政收支不能相抵，赤字相当庞大；因此而来的货币发行量亦即随之增多了。为什么这一时期国家的开支会猛烈增加呢？这就是因为：为适应解放全中国的需要，人民解放军大大的增加了，接收原属国民党之军政公教人员超过了一百万人以上；各种生产与交通事业的恢复建设，需要大量的投资；对外贸易的开展，土产收购及保证主要工业原料的供应（如棉花等），亦需要投放巨额的贸易资金。这一切支出虽然很大，但是必需的，都是与人民根本利益有关的大事和好事，政府必须举办。但另方面，同时期政府的收入却不能得到正比例的增加。“许多收入暂时还停顿着，新解放区城市的税收和农村的税收，或者是因为战争和封锁而陷于停顿，需要整理和恢复，或者是受着季节的限制，暂时不能征收，用于恢复生产和恢复交通的投资短期间不能收回成本，更说不上得到利润”。因此，在这种收入不能大量增加，巨额支出必须维持的情况下，政府的财政发行也就必须随之增加，这就是此次币值下跌物价上涨的基本原因。
    （二）随着市场货币流通量的增加，曾经沉寂一时的市场游资，近月来又形活跃。这批游资在市场上的投机囤积，兴风作浪，亦为此次物价波动的主要原因之一。如上海市场平时我国营贸易机关，每月抛售大米一万担左右即可保持米价的稳定；但此次物价波动时，一月抛售大米六万多担，米价仍不能稳住。京津两市平时我国营粮食公司，每日出售粮食只占市场总成交量的百分之二、三十，而物价波动时，则经常占百分之八十左右，北京“粮老虎”王振廷等奸商，在物价上涨时，拒售粮食哄抬粮价，即为一明证。因之也就大大的增加了政府平稳物价的阻力。
    （三）物资供求的暂时失调，对此次物价波动亦起着一定的影响。如纱布现正值销售季节，但由于交通不便，调拨困难，在华中、西北各区皆曾引起了暂时的供求失调现象。华南广大地区解放后，纱布需要量亦大大增加，因之，全国纱布产量最多的上海市场，近月来纱布即成为投机囤积的主要对象，形成各货价格随着纱布带头上涨。华北区则由于今年灾情较重，粮食歉收，产棉区粮食缺乏；加以前一时期为了防范鼠疫，京绥交通暂时中断，西北粮源被阻及东北来粮较少等因素，亦形成了华北区粮食供求一度失调，各货价格以粮食带头上涨。此外我国营贸易机关，这一时期在有计划的调剂供求工作上，及各货价格及时的合理的主动调整工作上，亦存在着一定的缺点。
    以上各点，即是此次物价波动的主要原因，在物价波动发生后，我国营贸易公司及交通运输机关即赶运粮食纱布等类大量物资，大量抛售，供应各地市场需要。近旬来各地物价，已开始普遍回落。但这是否说明物价问题今天已经解决了呢？不是的，因为物价问题的本质是一个财政问题，当国家的财政收支还不能达到平衡的情况下，要维持物价的完全稳定是有困难的。但我们也必须认识到，我们今天的这种困难，是暂时的、胜利中的困难，是可以也完全有办法克服的，与国民党反动政府灭亡过程中的困难有本质的不同。
    为有效地解决物价问题，防止通货膨胀及今后再度发生周期性的物价波动，我们今天必须采取“釜底抽薪”从根本上解决问题的办法。
