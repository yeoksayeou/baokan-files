[Northeast Dispatch] Changchun Municipal No. 2 Middle School and Jilin Municipal Middle School have both launched teacher and student school-building movements. The former has achieved great results, while the latter's effects are not good. Changchun No. 2 Middle School closely integrated the school-building with the teaching plan, grasped the principle that school-building is for teaching, and students learned knowledge from the school-building. Therefore, they actively collected equipment, reaching more than 3,000 pieces in a certain week, all of which were lost instruments, models, wall charts, etc., which were used to make demonstration and experimental equipment needed for teaching, such as radio telegraphs, broadcasters, and radio broadcasting machines. A small meteorological station was also established to test temperature, humidity, air pressure, evaporation, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction. At the same time, waste products are used in teaching: such as using waste batteries, waste vacuum tubes, etc. as models to explain their structure during lectures; and a microscope is connected to glasses, plus a plane reflecting mirror, to make a reflecting microscope. In the dark room, cells can be magnified more than 10,000 times in their original color and shape on a white wall, making explanation and drawing extremely convenient, overcoming the difficulty of having few microscopes for many people. They also raise white mice and rabbits to supply each group with materials for dissection. After the school was built, the teaching and learning enthusiasm of teachers and students has greatly improved. Many teachers have moved to live in the school for the convenience of teaching; the history teacher and the geography and mineralogy teacher are planning to set up special classrooms. In contrast, Jilin City Middle School deviated from teaching and spent a lot of time and energy manufacturing Pushkin's chronology, history charts of modern literary and artistic trends, and explanations of the six categories of Chinese characters, which are academic and have little relationship with current teaching (the school only has the first grade of junior high school). The dissected pheasants, rabbits, dogs, fish, etc. are not preserved in alcohol, and are thrown away after they rot after being exhibited. At the same time, the school's school-building movement was carried out in the form of competition finals, which affected normal teaching and the health of teachers and students. For example, during the six days of the school-building exhibition, there were no formal classes. Many teachers and students stayed up late drawing charts and diagrams, and dozed off in class during the day. In addition, things were donated in a competitive manner, which aroused dissatisfaction among teachers and students.

[Another Dispatch] The ten-day school-building exhibition held by Changchun No. 2 Middle School from the 25th of last month to the 4th of this month absorbed many suggestions from viewers on improving teaching methods, and also provided great inspiration and help to other schools.

The exhibits are divided into categories such as electrical, optical, physiology and hygiene, physics, chemistry, botany, mathematics, geography, history, Chinese language, Sino-Soviet friendship, sports, and greenhouse. Most of the materials are donated by teachers and students. Many specimens in other museums are collected by students from the wild in their spare time. The geography hall has maps, mountain models, and product distribution diagrams drawn by students. The chemistry hall has matches, soap, and toothpaste made by students. In particular, the greenhouse was built entirely by students collecting glass and wood. In each part of the exhibition, students explain scientific principles to visitors, or do some simple experiments for everyone to see. For example, in the electrical hall, the model of a tram made of tinplate can run back and forth on the track when it is powered on; and the principle of traffic control lights on the road is explained with very simple devices.

　　收集器材充实教学设备
  　长春市立二中　师生积极建校
    吉林市中发生脱离教学偏向
    【东北讯】长春市立第二中学和吉林市立中学都展开了师生建校运动，前者获得很大成绩，后者效果不好。长春市二中在建校中密切结合了教学计划，掌握了建校为了教学的原则，学生从建校中学到了知识，因而积极收集器材，在某一周中即达三千余件，均系散失的仪器、模型、挂图等，用以作成教学上需要的示教和实验用具，如无线电报机、播音器、无线电广播机等；并建立了一个小型的气象台，作温度、温度、气压、蒸发、降水量、风速、风向等测验。同时把废品利用到教学上：如用废电池、废真空管等作讲课时说明其构造的模型；又把一架显微镜接在眼镜上，加上平面折射镜，制成反射显微镜，在暗室中可将细胞以原色原状扩大万倍以上反映在白墙上，使讲解绘图均极方便，克服了镜少人多的困难。他们还饲养白鼠、兔，供给各小组学习解剖。建校后师生教学与学习情绪大大提高，许多教师为了教学方便，搬到学校来住；历史教员、地理矿物科学教员则正在筹设特别教室。与此相反，吉林市中却脱离教学的花费了很多时间精力，制造普希金年表、近代文艺思潮史图表、六书图解等偏于学术性而与目前教学关系不大的东西（该校仅有初中一年级）。解剖了的雉、兔、狗、鱼等则不用酒精泡制，展览完臭了就扔掉。同时，该校建校运动是以竞赛决赛方式进行的，因而影响了正常教学和师生健康。如开建校展览会时，六天时间没有正式上课，不少师生因突击绘图表直到半夜，白天上课打盹。另外还以竞赛方式献东西，引起教师与学生均表不满。
    【又讯】长春市二中自上月二十五日至本月四日举行的历时十天的建校展览会，吸收了观众许多改进教育方法的意见，同时亦予其他学校以莫大的启发和帮助。
    展览品共分电气、光学、生理卫生、物理、化学、博物、数学、地理、历史、国文、中苏友好、体育及温室等类，其中材料大部是师生献出的，其他象博物馆的不少标本是同学们课余从野外搜集来的；地理馆有同学们绘制的地图、山脉模型、产物分布图解，化学馆有同学们制造的火柴、肥皂、牙膏；特别是温室，完全是靠同学自己搜集玻璃木料修建起来的。在展览会每一部分，都有同学向参观者解释科学原理，或作些简单的实验给大家看。如电气馆内，他们用洋铁片制成的电车模型，通上电可以在轨道上来回跑；又用很简单的装置解释马路上交通指挥灯的原理等。
