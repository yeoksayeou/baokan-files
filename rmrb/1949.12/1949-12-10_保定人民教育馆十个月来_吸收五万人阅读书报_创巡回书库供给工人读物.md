[Baoding News] The Baoding People's Education Center has achieved great success in its social education work over the past ten months. In terms of reading work, it sorted out more than 55,100 books and magazines, removing those containing feudal, erotic, and reactionary elements, and ordered 5,806 new books and magazines, as well as over 20 kinds of newspapers. The number of visitors to the center reached 51,099, averaging about 160 people per day, most of whom were students and merchants, followed by workers and farmers. The center also conducted extensive mobile education work in two ways. One way was through "mobile libraries," which brought popular books, ballad stories, picture albums, and other easily accessible reading materials to workers' night schools for reading, along with explanations provided at any time, which was very popular among the workers. This work has been expanded to various factories, providing each factory with a certain number of books and newspapers, and adding more as needed. Another way was through "mobile cultural sheds," which collected a variety of cartoons, photographs, and some books, and transported them by vehicle to various factories or places where the masses gathered, allowing everyone to read freely. In terms of holding lectures and answering questions, from April to October, ten lectures were held on labor-capital policies, May Day, August 15th, exposing the White Paper, and strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship. The number of participants reached 5,867. Social problem-solving was based on questions raised by citizens and in suggestion boxes, or the general ideological situation of the masses in the implementation of a certain policy. According to the spirit of the policy, special answers were given on the blackboard, and some were answered by letter or face-to-face according to their nature. According to half-year statistics, a total of 32 questions were answered, and there were also 41 letter and face-to-face replies. In terms of propaganda work, through current affairs blackboards, wired broadcasting stations, active slogans, and woodcut paintings, five methods were used to carry out propaganda in coordination with each central task, using unified materials. For recreational activities, in addition to the children's playground, public recreation room, and basketball court in the center, two music learning classes were held, with 100 students; it also helped establish five street theater groups, three factory theater groups, and four school theater groups. Under the principle of self-writing, self-directing, and self-performing, they wrote 87 scripts, and more than a dozen new programs were performed every major festival. In September and October, two literary and art learning classes were held, with 511 new and old literary and art workers participating, laying the foundation for further development of literary and art work.
