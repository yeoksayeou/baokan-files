　　Combining Newspapers and Textbooks
    First Division of the Affiliated High School of the Normal University

　　Since the beginning of this semester, due to practical needs and the encouragement and persuasion of various teachers, the atmosphere of reading newspapers has become very strong. In addition to the newspapers and periodicals in the library, each class subscribes to at least one newspaper. Whenever the newspaper arrives, everyone crowds around, vying to read the current affairs news. Therefore, newspapers have been of great help to students in terms of political current affairs. However, apart from some current affairs news, few students carefully read the other sections. In fact, there are many materials in newspapers that can be learned and materials that can be linked to our courses, but we have not been able to make good use of them.

　　First of all, Mr. Zhang, who teaches geography, told us not to read newspapers superficially. There are many materials in newspapers that can help you study, and you should be able to read them well, which is of great help to your studies. Before he talked about the resources of the Hetao agricultural reclamation area, he told the students to read the "Good Place for Industrial Investment" in the People's Daily on September 21 and to discuss it in groups. As a result, before the teacher even lectured, the students had already figured out the resources of Chahar and Suiyuan and how to develop industry. The students not only understood the various resources, but also knew their uses and development. When talking about cotton production on the Loess Plateau, he asked the students to refer to the textile industry in Northwest China (People's Daily, September 14). When talking about the agricultural, industrial, and commercial areas of the Yangtze River Plain, because the area used to be a dumping ground and raw material extraction site for imperialism, and for various reasons, industry and commerce occupied the top position, he combined this with "Several Characteristics of Old China's Industry" (People's Daily, September 24) to explain, so that students could see the general face of imperialist aggression against China.

　　At the same time, in terms of Chinese language, in addition to teaching textbooks, students automatically find some lively, profound, and meaningful articles in newspapers to read, in order to supplement the deficiencies of the textbooks. For example, "6:20" in the People's Garden is an article that everyone loves to read and everyone wants to read.

　　Students have obtained more specific and living knowledge from using newspapers in this way than from books. So we say: "In the future, we must read newspapers carefully and link them with our courses."

　　报纸和课本结合
    师大附中一  部奔流
    这一学期开学以来，由于实际的需要和各位先生的鼓励、说服，读报的风气很浓厚，除图书馆所有报章外，每班都至少订有一份报纸。每当报一送来，大家便挤作一团，争看时事消息，因此报纸在政治时事上给同学们帮助不小。不过除去一些时事新闻外，其他各版很少有同学仔细去看。其实报纸上有不少可以学习的材料，以及可以和我们课程互相联系的材料，我们没能好好去利用就是了。
    首先，教地理的张先生告诉我们，看报不要走马观花，报章上有许多可以辅助你学习的资料，要能好好读它，这对于学习上有很大的帮助。当他未讲漠南草原农垦区资源以前，便告诉同学们去看一看九月二十一日人民日报“工业投资的好地方”，并且可以放到小组里去讨论。结果先生上课还没讲，同学们早把察绥的资源和工业如何发展，搞得明明白白，同学们不但了解了各种资源，并且知道了他的用途及发展。在讲黄土高原的棉产时，他又让同学去参考了西北的纺织业（九月十四日人民日报）。讲到长江平原农工商业区域时，因该区过去为帝国主义的倾销场，原料榨取地，以及种种原因使工商业占了头等地位，便配合着“旧中国工业若干特点”（九月二十四日人民日报）来讲，这样使同学们看清了帝国主义侵略中国的一般面貌。
    同时，国文方面，除了讲授课本以外，同学们自动的在报上找一些生动的，深刻的，有意义的文章来读，以补充课内读本之不足。如人民园地上的“六点二十分”便是我们人人爱读，人人要读的文章。
    同学们这样的利用了报纸，得到比书本上更多具体的活的知识。所以我们说：“今后读报要仔细的去读，并且要和我们课程联系一起。”
