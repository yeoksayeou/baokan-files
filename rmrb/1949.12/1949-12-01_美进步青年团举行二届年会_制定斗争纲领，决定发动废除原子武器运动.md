　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th: TASS, New York, December 29th—The second annual meeting of the American Progressive Youth League (the youth organization of the Progressive Party), recently held in Cleveland, formulated a program to fight for peace, employment, and democratic rights. More than 800 white and black youth representatives from 25 states attended.
　　According to the Workers Daily, the annual meeting decided that the American Progressive Youth should concentrate its efforts in January next year to launch a movement demanding the abolition of atomic weapons. In order to deal with the growing unemployment problem faced by American youth, the United States should submit a "Youth Bill of Rights" to Congress, which stipulates an increase in unemployment compensation, the implementation of large-scale public works programs to increase employment, and the implementation of a federally funded installment student program. The annual meeting passed a resolution requesting the United States to "negotiate with the Soviet Union to declare atomic warfare illegal," and demanding the destruction of stored atomic weapons and the reduction of all armaments. In addition, there were resolutions calling for the abolition of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law and the enactment of civil rights legislation to eliminate discrimination against blacks. During the discussion, youth representatives from many parts of the United States described the tragic situation of increasing unemployment. Linfield, Executive Director of the Progressive Youth League, gave the main report to the annual meeting. He said that more than half of the total number of unemployed in the United States are young people. The annual meeting re-elected Linfield as Chairman, and David McCann and Christine Walker as Vice-Chairmen.

    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：近在克利夫兰举行的美国进步青年团（进步党的青年组织）第二届年会，制订了为和平、就业与民主权利而斗争的纲领。出席者有来自二十五个州的白人与黑人青年代表八百余人。
    据工人日报报道，年会决定美国进步青年在明年一月间，应集中力量发动要求废除原子武器的运动；美国进步青年为了对付美国青年面临的日益增长的失业问题，美国应向国会提出一项“青年权利法案”，其中规定增加失业补偿金，实施大规模公共工程计划，以增加就业，并实施联邦资助分期学生的计划。年会通过决议，要求美国“与苏联谈判，以便宣布原子战争为非法”，并要求毁灭储存的原子武器，裁减一切军备。此外，尚有要求废除塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法，制定民权立法，以取消对黑人的歧视等决议。在讨论中，来自美国许多地方的青年代表，描述了失业增长的惨状。进步青年团执行主任林菲尔德向年会作了主要报告。他说：在美国失业者总数中，有半数以上为青年。年会连选林菲尔德为主席，大卫·麦堪与克里斯丁·瓦克尔为副主席。
