Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: TASS, Sofia - The Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, on the 16th, considered the request of Kostov, who was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court for treason, espionage, and sabotage. It found no grounds for clemency and rejected the request. The sentence against Kostov was executed on the 16th.

Kostov's request to the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria on December 14th stated: "Respected members of the Assembly, I plead guilty to all the charges against me by the court, and I fully admit that my confessions during the preliminary investigation were true. Later, before the Supreme Court, I recognized the impropriety of my actions, which endangered the People's Republic of Bulgaria and cast a shadow on its people's democratic system. I sincerely regret my actions, which were manifestations of extreme nervous excitement and morbid pseudo-intellectual arrogance. I also regret my actions and sins as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee, which harmed the interests of Bulgaria and damaged its friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Therefore, I request that you revoke (if you deem it possible) the death sentence against me and change it to severe life imprisonment. I believe that the Supreme Court's verdict is absolutely correct, that it conforms to the interests of Bulgaria's normal and stable development, and to its struggle against the encroachment on Bulgaria's territorial integrity and sovereignty by American and British imperialists and their lackeys – the Tito clique and their group of socialist traitors."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: TASS, Sofia, 16th: The Bulgarian people unanimously support the verdict against Kostov and his accomplices. The Bulgarian Communist Party organ, "Workers' Affairs," stated in its editorial: "The trial in Sofia has satisfied the wishes and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses in Bulgaria's cities and countryside." The Farmers' Party organ, "Agricultural Banner," emphasized that spies and traitors have received their due punishment. The paper stated: "Our country, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, is building socialism with full confidence. The Bulgarian people have deep confidence in their happy future and continue to strengthen their ties with their protector and defender – the Soviet Union." "Izgrev" reported, "The excellent achievements of our people's government have enabled it to successfully detect the snake pit of spies and traitors who have burrowed into state organs. Now, the gentlemen in Washington and London, who held high hopes for their Kostov-style lackeys, are extremely discouraged."

　　保叛国犯受到应得惩罚
  　科斯托夫已处决
    保人民一致拥护最高法院判决
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团，于十六日考虑了因叛国、间谍、破坏罪而被最高法院宣判死刑的科斯托夫的请求，认为没有理由可予宽恕，而对该请求置之不理。对科斯托夫的判决，业已于十六日执行。
    科斯托夫十二月十四日向保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团所提出的请求书称：可敬的议员们：我对法庭对我的一切控告服罪，并且完全承认初步调查时我的供辞是真实的。后来，我在最高法院之前认识到自己这种危害保加利亚人民共和国并对其人民民主制度投上阴影的行为之不当，我便真心懊悔我的行为，这种行为，是极端神经质的激动与病态的假知识分子的自大的表现。我也懊悔我作部长会议副主席和财经委员会主席时的行径与罪孽，这种行径与罪孽损害了保加利亚的利益，也损害了它和苏联及人民民主国家的友好关系。因此，我请求你们撤消（假如认为可以的话）对我的死刑判决，并改为严厉的无期徒刑。我认为，最高法院的判决绝对正确，它符合保加利亚的正常而稳定的发展之利益，也符合它反对美英帝国主义者、反对其走狗——铁托及其社会主义叛徒集团——对保加利亚领土完整与主权之侵害这一斗争的利益。
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社索非亚十六日讯：保加利亚人民一致拥护对科斯托夫及其同谋者的判决。保共机关报工人事业报在社论中指出：索非亚的审判，满足了保加利亚城乡群众的愿望和爱国热情。农民党机关报农业旗帜报强调间谍和叛国者受到了应得的惩罚。该报称：我国在保加利亚共产党领导之下，正满怀信心地建设着社会主义。保加利亚人民对于他们幸福的前途深具信心，并且继续巩固与他们的保护者和防卫者——苏联的联系。伊兹格列夫报称：“我们人民政权优异的成就，使它得以成功地侦察出钻进国家机关的间谍和叛国者的蛇穴。现在，华盛顿和伦敦对他们的科斯托夫式的走狗抱着厚望的绅士们，是十分沮丧了。”
