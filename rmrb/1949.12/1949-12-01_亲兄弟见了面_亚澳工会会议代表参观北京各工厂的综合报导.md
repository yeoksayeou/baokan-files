Meeting of Brothers: Comprehensive Report on Visits to Beijing Factories by Representatives of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference

During the recess of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, the representatives from various countries divided into six groups on November 25th to visit major factories in Beijing, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, 70th Arsenal, Clothing Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, and Renli Carpet Factory. The meeting of brothers was filled with indescribable joy and excitement. Although there were difficulties due to different languages, this did not hinder the sincere exchange of class sentiments. The common hatred for international imperialism and the shared belief in a communist society had long united the working class of the world into a single entity. Nine representatives from five countries—the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Burma, Korea, and Mongolia—visited the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory. On the way to Changxindian, Soviet representative Comrade Bessenov practiced speaking Chinese phrases like "Long Live Mao Zedong" in order to address his Chinese worker brothers. The workers of Changxindian, eager to welcome their international friends, held up a large red banner that read, "Salute to the Brother Trade Unions of Asia and Australia!" and greeted them. A yangko dance team, adorned with red and green, led the welcoming procession, vying to lift Comrade Bessenov high in the air. Applause, cheers, and songs filled the air. Bessenov warmly shook hands with the workers. At the welcome meeting, young worker Qi Baoshan delivered a speech on behalf of all the workers, saying: "Because of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the convening of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, our class brothers from Asia and Australia have come to Beijing to attend the meeting. This is the happiest thing in our lives. Today, when we Asian and Australian workers meet, it is like blood brothers reuniting. You are struggling, and we are struggling. Your victory is our victory. From now on, we hope to unite even more closely, unite within the democratic and peaceful camp headed by socialist Soviet Union, and fight together to shatter the new war plots of imperialism, defend peace in the Far East and the world, and strive for people's democracy." Soviet representative Bessenov, Vietnamese representative Liu Defu, and a Burmese worker representative all spoke. Comrade Bessenov said: "Dear brothers and sisters, on behalf of the Soviet working people, I extend warm greetings to you and hope that the friends present will convey these greetings to all the Chinese people. The Soviet working people, like the working people of the world, celebrate the great victory of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism. This victory can consolidate world peace. I believe that the worker brothers of Changxindian, like all the worker brothers of China, will use labor and production to consolidate this victory, complete the task of building a new China, and achieve a happy life." Finally, Bessenov shouted the slogan "Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong!" in Chinese. Vietnamese representative Liu Defu said: "The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War is an encouragement and example for the national liberation struggles of all Southeast Asian countries. China will soon be completely liberated, and Vietnam will also be completely liberated one day. We hope that the people of China and Vietnam will unite more closely." Burmese representative Aung Win said: "The People's Republic of China is a supporter of peace in Asia. Its victory has given the Burmese people infinite encouragement. In the near future, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will liberate Yunnan, and the Burmese People's Liberation Army will also liberate the border areas of Burma close to Yunnan. At that time, our Chinese and Burmese People's Liberation Armies will cheer and shake hands on the Yunnan-Burma border." The workers of Changxindian presented the visiting representatives with exquisitely crafted models of hammers, engraved with two sentences: "Labor creates a new world, the hammer smashes the old world."

Representatives from Indonesia, Thailand, Mongolia, and Korea visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. When Indonesian representative Majono passed by the light oil refining plant, worker Wu Zixin, who was installing machinery, enthusiastically said: "I heard your report in our factory. I know that the Indonesian people are waging a heroic struggle against imperialism. We, the working class of new China, will definitely support you. Don't be afraid! Persevere! The final victory belongs to us." To celebrate the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant increased voluntary shifts and completed the two major projects of the light oil refining plant and the ore screening plant two months ahead of schedule.

Representatives from Iran, Korea, Mongolia, Malaya, and the Philippines visited the 70th Arsenal. The factory courtyard was plastered with slogans and short articles welcoming the representatives. Worker Wang Junzhen delivered a welcome speech, saying: "We welcome you, we are all happy. Let's unite closely and fight those warmongers. We are many and strong, we are not afraid of them. If they dare to bully us, we can eliminate them."

Wherever the representatives went, there were applause and cheers. The visiting representatives were also warmly received and warmly welcomed at the People's Printing Factory, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Clothing Factory, and the Renli Carpet Factory.

　　亲兄弟见了面　亚澳工会会议代表参观北京各工厂的综合报导
    出席亚澳工会会议的各国代表，趁着大会休会的空隙，在十一月二十五号分成六组，参观了北京市石景山钢铁厂、长辛店铁路机厂、七十兵工厂、被服厂、电信局、仁立地毯厂等首都各主要工厂，亲兄弟见了面，都有说不出的愉快和兴奋，虽然有着语言不同的困难，可是这并没有妨碍阶级感情的真诚交流，对国际帝国主义的共同仇恨，对共产主义社会的共同信念，早把全世界工人阶级团结成一个整体了。参观长辛店铁路机厂的有苏联、越南、缅甸、朝鲜、蒙古五国的九位代表，在去长辛店的路上，苏联代表别森诺夫同志为了向中国工人弟兄致词，一路上学着“毛泽东万岁”的中国话，长辛店的工人们为了欢迎国际友人，打着向亚澳两洲兄弟工会致敬的大红旗，早就迎出来了，披红挂绿的秧歌队，扭到欢迎队伍的最前面，争先恐后地把别森诺夫同志高高地举起来，鼓掌声欢呼声和歌唱声响成了一片。别森诺夫亲热地和工人握手。在欢迎大会上，青年工人齐保善代表全体工人致词，他说：“因为中国人民解放战争的胜利和亚澳工会会议的召开，各位亚洲澳洲的阶级弟兄才到我们北京来开会，这是我们一生最快乐的事情，我们亚澳两洲工人今天见了面，就好象一母所生的亲兄弟欢聚在一堂。你们在斗争我们也在斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利，希望从今以后，我们更亲密地团结起来，团结在以社会主义苏联为首的民主和平阵营里，为粉碎帝国主义的新战争阴谋，保卫远东与世界和平，争取人民民主而共同奋斗。苏联代表别森诺夫、越南代表刘德福和缅甸的工人代表都讲了话。别森诺夫同志说：“亲爱的兄弟姊妹们，我代表苏联劳动人民向你们致热烈的敬礼，并且希望在会的朋友们把这份敬礼转致全中国人民。苏联劳动人民和世界劳动人民一样，欢庆中国人民反帝、反封建的伟大胜利，这个胜利能够巩固全世界的和平。相信长辛店的工人弟兄一定会象全中国工人弟兄一样，拿劳动生产来巩固这个胜利，完成建设新中国的任务，得到幸福的生活。”最后别森诺夫用中国话喊出“毛泽东同志万岁！“的口号。越南代表刘德福说：“人中国民解放战争的胜利对于整个东南亚各国民族解放战争是一个鼓舞和榜样。中国不久就要全部解放，越南也有一天是会全部解放的。我们希望中、越两国人民更亲密地团结起来。”缅甸代表翁温说：“中华人民共和国是亚洲和平的支持，它的胜利，给了缅甸人民以无限的鼓舞，不久的将来，中国人民解放军就要解放云南，缅甸的人民解放军也将要解放缅甸和云南接近的边境，那时我们中缅两国人民解放军就要在滇缅边境欢呼握手了。”长辛店工友们把自己制成的精巧的铁锤模型献给参观的代表们，铁锤上还刻着两句话：“劳动创造新世界、铁锤粉碎旧世界”。
    参观石景山钢铁厂的有印尼、泰国、蒙古、朝鲜四国的代表，当印尼代表玛佐诺走过轻油精炼厂的时候，正在装机器的工人吴子新热情地说：“你在我们厂子里的报告我听到了，我知道印尼人民正在向帝国主义进行着英勇的斗争，我们新中国的工人阶级一定支持你们，不用怕！要坚持下去！最后胜利是属于我们的。”石景山钢铁厂的工友为了庆祝亚澳工会会议，增加义务班，提前两个月完成了轻油精炼厂和矿砂筛选厂两大工程。
    参观七十兵工厂的有伊朗、朝鲜、蒙古、马来亚、菲律宾五国的代表，工厂院落里帖满了欢迎代表的标语和短文，工人王俊真致欢迎词说：“你们来了，我们欢迎你们，我们大家伙全都高兴。咱们大家要紧紧的团结起来，和那些战争贩子们干，咱们人多势众，咱们不怕他们，他们敢欺侮我们，我们就能消灭他们。”
    代表们到那里，掌声欢呼声就在那里。参观的代表们在人民印刷厂、电信局、被服厂、仁立地毯厂也都受到了亲切的招待和热烈的欢迎。
