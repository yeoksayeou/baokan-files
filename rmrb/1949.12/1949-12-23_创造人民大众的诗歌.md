　　Creating Poetry for the People
　　Ji Chuyang

　　Without form, there is no art to speak of. Comrade Fadeyev once said: "Without beautiful form, there is no art." Therefore, we should not only value form, but also "our works must be beautiful, and we should fight for complete form!"

　　However, we oppose a simple "pursuit" of form. Art for art's sake is a reaction to the demands of form, because in terms of the creative principles of literature and art, "content determines form" and "from the dialectic of life to the dialectic of art." It is necessary to demand a form that can fully express the content of life for a certain content of life, with a high degree of pursuit and arduous thinking. On the contrary, it is not only inappropriate to leave the content of life and fall into the magic of "form," but it also needs to be given a powerful blow!

　　There are problems with our poetry writing, needless to say, but it is not an abstract problem of form. It is wrong to understand it this way, and this understanding itself is a formal understanding. As for trying to use empty forms to cover up the dryness and weakness of the content, that tendency is fundamentally anti-realistic.

　　Some people naively replace poetry popularization with "understanding or not," or simply confuse it with the utilization and transformation of old forms, which are also one-sided and narrow understandings. We support learning from the folk, we approve of the utilization of old forms, but to demand that poetry become a uniform drum ballad, or to force poetry into a certain stereotyped cage, is not only unreasonable, but more importantly, it obliterates the profound meaning of "bringing forth the new from the old" and literary and artistic creation (creation).

　　What is the basic problem of poetry writing? I think it is basically a matter of life, thought, emotion, and language. The so-called expressiveness, the most important thing must be the exploration of the most powerful and accurate language for the masses of the people for the high degree of combination of a certain life, thought, and emotion. Because, to practice Chairman Mao's direction in literature and art, the first thing is to go deep into reality for a long time, to be patient with the twists and turns of the struggle, on the one hand to learn to transform oneself, and on the other hand to experience life, and the second thing is to overcome the half-baked, ambiguous, empty, wasteful, and bitter language forms of intellectuals. To start from any point other than this, and to start from a simple form, is to first bind, trap, or strangle oneself!

　　Give the ossified concepts of old aesthetics a blow, and attack conservatism, laziness, and prejudice! Make the authenticity, ideological character, and artistic character of poetry writing deeply combined, and earnestly study, create, and struggle tirelessly for the creation of new poetry for the people!

　　创造人民大众的诗歌
    纪初阳
    离开了形式，便没有什么艺术可讲。法捷耶夫同志曾说：“没有优美的形式，就没有艺术。”因此，对于形式，我们不仅应当重视，而且“我们的作品必然是优美的，我们应当为完整的形式而斗争”！
    但，我们反对一种单纯的对于形式的“钻营”。为形式而形式，是对于形式要求的一种反动，因为就文学艺术的创作原则来讲，是“内容决定形式”，是“从生活的辩证到艺术的辩证”。为一定的生活内容，要求着能够充分表现这生活内容的形式，为它怀着高度的追求热情与艰苦的思索，是必要的。相反，离开了生活内容，坠入“形式”的魔道，则不仅不该，还需给以有力的打击！
    我们的诗歌写作，存在着问题，这不消说，但不是抽象的形式问题，这样理解是错误的，这种理解的本身就是形式的理解。至于由此，而企图着用空虚的形式来掩盖内容的枯涩和无力，那倾向基本上也是反现实的。
    有人对于诗歌大众化，幼稚的以“懂不懂论”来代替，或简单的与旧形式的利用和改造的相混淆，这也都是片面的，狭窄的认识。我们拥护向民间学习，我们赞成对于旧形式的利用，然而要求诗歌成为千篇一律的大鼓词，或逼着诗歌走向某种定型的牢笼，这便不仅无理，而更重要的是抹杀了“推陈出新”和文艺创作（创造）的深刻意义。
    诗歌写作的问题基本上是什么呢？我认为基本上是生活，思想，感情和语言的问题。所谓表现力，其中最主要的不能不是为了一定的生活，思想，感情的高度结合而向人民大众探索最有力量和最准确的语言问题。因为，实践毛主席的文艺方向，首先是长时间地深入实际，耐心于曲折的斗争，一方面学习改造自己，一方面在体验生活，其次则是必须克服知识分子的夹生，含混，空虚，浪费，苦涩的语言形式。不从这里出发，而从单纯的形式出发，那是首先要把自己缚起来，套起来，或捏死！
    给旧美学的僵化观念以打击，向保守，庸懒，成见进攻！使诗歌写作的真实性，思想性，艺术性深刻的结合起来，为新的，人民大众的诗歌的创作，认真的学习，创造，不息的斗争！
