　　On Isakovsky's Poetry
    By Pavlovich, translated by Huang Wu

    Isakovsky's path as a poet is closely linked to his own history. Along that path of struggle, he had to overcome poverty, lack of education, and illness. Due to poor eyesight, he was unable to read for many years. During the Patriotic War, although he longed to go to the front, illness forced him to retreat to the rear. But the poet could always find spiritual strength in his heart to serve the people, and his talent could always find appropriate forms of service. In the Soviet land, the poet's songs reached far and wide, even victoriously crossing the border with the Red Army.

    Many of the poet's poems have become folk songs, and at the same time, their basis and source of inspiration are also folk songs. The interaction is complete and significant.

    During the war, he wrote "My Home Was Looted and Destroyed," in which the word "revenge" is mentioned: I raise this word, a burning flag, conceived in my heart, a living word.

    The Soviet people's hatred of the enemy is only another aspect of their love for the motherland. All of Isakovsky's lyrical poems are truly songs of love for the country, a kind of deep, personal, and therefore not abstract love. Therefore, the general form of Russian girls appearing in Isakovsky's poems emerges as a distinctive character. That is why Katyusha is so popular among the masses, because every soldier, every young soldier recognizes in his own lover this Russian girl who "walks up the steep riverbank." If the author had not injected so much social and personal emotion into his characters, this would not have been possible. No wonder the soldiers called their beautiful mortars "Katyusha," from which they received the spirit of victory revealed in Isakovsky's poems.

    Regarding Isakovsky, we can say that he truly knows, sees, and hears these girls in his poems, just as he knows and loves his country, as large as the entire territory of the great Soviet Union, as small as his hometown in the Smolensk region, where his hometown reflects all of life as a drop of water reflects the ocean.

    Although he no longer lives in the countryside, the roots of his poems are still deeply connected to it, and his heart and thoughts are also entrusted there. A piece of land, a plow, and a rake—I now remember, that is my home. Under today's vast sky, how many times has my mind flown to my childhood home!

    The contrast between "the high and clear sky of our time" and the gloomy atmosphere of the poor countryside before the revolution is a historical perspective, without which deep and serious poetic content is impossible. The poet's poems, despite their emotional warmth, are wise, and therefore their appeal is universal. His songs are his most popular works, the pinnacle of his creative efforts, they bring fame to the poet, and they give the poet the freedom to gallop his heart. But Isakovsky's poems are not limited to songs.

    The poet depicts the transformation of the Russian countryside under the happy light of the revolution, and he is concerned about the protection of this precious land. The ideality and appeal of his works lie in this concern; therefore, it is natural that the poet even in peacetime dedicates many of his poems to the soldiers guarding the border, the navy, and the air force, and in wartime, he calls on the whole nation to rise up to defend the country.

    Marking the initial stage of his work is the intention to describe familiar scenes of his life, as well as the changes those scenes experienced after the revolution. He depicted a scene that, at first glance, seems to have the style of Yesenin: an amber-colored, tranquil stream flowing through pastures and gullies, where dappled sunlight shimmers, and willows are also projected into it.

    (Isakovsky) A brocade woven of amber clouds floats over the forest; in the sleepy noon's silence, the pine trees whisper.

    (Yesenin)
    These lines could have come from the same poet, especially because of the similarity in rhythm and evenness. But this is only the initial impression. The synthesis of images in the two poems is completely different. In Yesenin's poems, the spires of monasteries and churches are indispensable features of the scenery, and "bird cherries send their fragrance across the prairie"... While in Isakovsky's poems: a smiling light illuminates the windows of the village school; a crow struts proudly across the pond, imitating the tractor driver.

    In Isakovsky's poems, schools are common. His best and most touching poem, "Winter Dusk," is dedicated to a village teacher. Now the storm is intensifying, and the fields are wrapped in snow and haze, and you are working even harder in a bright and cheerful house.

    The poem ends with these profound and highly lyrical lines: The wind and snow have buried all paths, erased all boundaries, and the light from your lonely window casts its rays far into the night.

    Isakovsky speaks of the light of the school, the thirst for knowledge as a characteristic of his countryside, but all of this plays no role in Yesenin's poems. Perhaps both poets have a sense of isolation from rural life. But in Isakovsky: Having lost all the rights of a farmer, I am still a country boy.

    And Yesenin feels that there is no longer a need for poetry here, just as there is no longer a need for myself.

    Such a confession would never come from Isakovsky's mouth. He sees the meaning of life in serving the people and the need for his poems. Yesenin calls himself "the last of the village poets," he cannot understand or accept the path the countryside takes in its development, but Isakovsky has every right to call himself the first collective farm poet. Therefore, there is a difference in tone and manner between the two poems. Isakovsky's poem is brave, purposeful, optimistic, and its vision is directed towards the future: The road ahead stretches forward through the noisy wheat fields, no matter where your wish is, you will soon reach your destination.

    In 1931, the National Publishing Bureau printed his selected poems, and he explained in the preface:

    "I strive to improve and disseminate everything new that the revolution brings to the countryside without sacrificing my art." This goal requires new artistic methods. Concrete subjects help him make the images clear. In the same preface, Isakovsky said: "I feel that in order for a poem to be understood and grasped, it must tell a story. Perhaps that is the simplest, most obvious story, but there must be one."

    When the war broke out, the poet refined his words into a weapon. His gaze radiated in all directions: following the refugees retreating from Smolensk, following the destroyed villages and towns, following the girls languishing in enslavement, following the guerrillas in the forests, following the Red Army in battle and rest. He understood that people everywhere needed that kind of song to express their sorrow and endure the hardships of the war; they needed this writer, who with confidence and conscience helped the people understand their situation and historical tasks.

    People entrusted the poet to speak for them, so Isakovsky injected the people's suffering and their will to win into their poems: Let these bitter tears turn into a scorching fire stream. The country asks the soldier through the mother's mouth: Dear son, where is your wife? .................. My child, your mother was deprived of bread, land, and home.

    The poet found an indescribable tone of tenderness and sorrow, but in the same voice, he called on people to fight: Listen to me, my son, you must be the first to join the battle.

    In 1941, when the enemy invaded the hinterland, the poet affirmed: Our country is strong and powerful; victory is certain.

    He saw the reality of this victory in the invincible power of the Soviet state and the collective farm system. We gave the food of our collective farm to our beloved country.

    "Fight for every cottage!" he said excitedly. He depicted heroism, not only of those on the front lines, but also of the simple collective farmers, the heroism of the old people. An old woman was determined to burn down her own cottage because enemy soldiers were sleeping in the house. This decision was not easy to make. Spiritually, she asked for forgiveness from her soldier son because she could not defend his father's home for him.

    Since the war has come, everyone must fight.

    Isakovsky revealed the meaning of the people's war. Before, the poet had seen the path of peaceful efforts under the shining light of Stalin's ideals, and as before, the poet now sees that the road to victory is inseparable from Stalin's name. To this great leader of the Soviet state, Isakovsky expressed such heartfelt feelings: We thank you for the diverse achievements, for the work completed with great effort. When the approaching enemy declares that we have already failed, we thank you for your steady assistance. Dear Comrade Stalin, we trust you even more than we trust ourselves.

    These lines written in 1945 echo his "Song of Stalin" written in 1936: He brought me strength and glory, and the long youth of the future, a beautiful dawn's blush lies across our sky. Then raise our voices, sing a song to the one we love, sing to justice, to the sun, to Stalin.

    Although Isakovsky's poems seem very simple and clear, they are not actually simple. That is the result of his mastery of methods and hard work. The threads used to string together the verses are invisible in the poet's works, and the effort of hammering is also imperceptible. We can only speculate about his skill from the degree of perfection his works achieve. The simplicity and truly popular nature of Isakovsky's poems were not obtained all at once. He worked very hard, sometimes writing a poem for many years, or writing several different poems on the same theme. The writing period of "Four Wishes" was from 1928 to 1935, while "On the Road" is completely a rewrite of "Song of the Road." Isakovsky's creative method is clearly reflected in his rewriting. "Song of the Road" has thirteen sections, and "On the Road" has only eleven sections, but the qualitative change outweighs the quantitative change. In the revised version of the second section of "On the Road," the image is more vivid, and the empty places have been deleted. In "Song of the Road," we see: Leaving the station, passing through the orchard, the valley appears in front of you, I walk, full of joy, towards the village I once knew.

    Here "orchard" is not important. It plays no role in the poem. The revised version is this: A blue and crystal clear morning, full of pleasant mood, I slowly leave the station and walk towards the village I once knew.

    Analyzing the language of this poem, we can see that the first version contains many special terms taken from the new rural vocabulary. Some of them are dynamic and have been incorporated into general usage and literature, but many have been eliminated later... Isakovsky often uses refrains or sentences from folk songs and revolutionary songs. Such as "I eat rice with tears" in "Four Wishes", "Over the mountains and ridges" in "Mother" dedicated to Spanish women, and so on. However, the sentences he borrows from others are never mechanically mixed into his own poems. When he says: Over the mountains, over the ridges, the division advances forward.

    We strongly realize the revolutionary flesh-and-blood relationship with the Spanish Republicans. Similarly, an old revolutionary song defines the tone of his "Farewell Song" written to Lenin's wife. Farewell, dear comrade, you have faithfully walked the glorious path of honor.

    Although songs are the highest achievement of Isakovsky's art, they did not immediately give him an outstanding position. His "Master of the Earth" was written based on the principles of ordinary spoken language and recitation poetry. This is Isakovsky's worst book, full of abstract words, lacking images, and the author is sometimes unfaithful to his original feelings and emotions in his wording. Later, Isakovsky demanded more harshness and strictness from himself, especially after he discovered that writing songs was his true career. The style of his songs developed gradually, starting with imitating folk songs, such as "Send You Home": Put an accordion in my hand and let the music flow. The young man sends his lover home; they take a sweet stroll.

    But Isakovsky's best songs, "Lyubusha," "Katyusha," "Border Guards," etc. are excellent and cannot be imitated. They only borrow some structural principles from old folk songs, such as parallelism, while the content and images are new. The infectiousness of these songs lies in their excellent Russian nature. The reader feels that a Russian cannot say that thing in any other way. Isakovsky's language is forged in the crucible of Russian classical literature, but it preserves the innocent freshness and popular idioms. The verses have so much musicality that you don't want to read them, but to sing them. And the things that these songs say can never be expressed by the old Russian folk songs of our grandfather's era before the revolution, because the concept of life in the old folk songs is completely different from the concept of life that the Soviet people are experiencing today.

    The people have accepted these songs and regarded them as their own, which is the highest honor and praise a poet can receive.
                                                               （1949, 11, 1·Translated from VOKS）

　　论伊萨柯夫斯基的诗
    巴甫洛维支作  荒芜译
    伊萨柯夫斯基的作为诗人的道路和他自身的历史是密切联系着的。沿着那条斗争的道路，他必须克服贫困、失学和疾病。由于目力不济，有好多年，他都不能看书。爱国战争期间，虽然他一心盼望上前线去，可是疾病迫使他撤到后方。但诗人总能在内心中找到精神力量，去为人民服务，而且他的天才总能发现适当的服务形式。在苏联国土上，诗人的歌无远弗届，甚至随红军，胜利地跨越了国境。
    诗人的诗，有许多都变成民歌，同时它们的基础和灵感的来源也就是民间歌谣。相互作用是圆满的，显著的。
    战争期间，他写了“我的故居被抢掠了，被破坏了”，诗中说到“复仇”这个字：我高举这个字眼，一面燃烧的旗帜，孕育在我的内心里的，一个活的字眼。
    苏维埃人对敌人憎恨只是他对祖国的热爱的另一方面。所有的伊萨柯夫斯基的抒情诗，全都是一首真正的热爱国家歌，那是一种深刻的，亲身的，因而也就绝不是抽象的一种爱。所以出现于伊氏诗中的一般形态的俄国姑娘们，在伊氏诗中乃浮现为显著的性格。所以卡秋莎是那么风行于群众之间，因为每一个战士，每一个青年士兵都在他自己的爱人身上，认出了“走上陡峭的河岸”的这个俄国姑娘。如果不是作者注入那么多的社会的和个人的情感到他的人物中去，那么这种事情就不可能。难怪士兵们把他们的漂亮的臼炮叫做“卡秋莎”了，他们从这里领受了伊氏诗歌中所吐露的胜利精神。
    关于伊萨柯夫斯基，我们可以说，他真正知道，看见和听见他的诗歌中这些姑娘们，正如他知道和钟爱他的国家，大如伟大苏维埃全部国土，小至斯摩棱斯克区的他的故乡，故乡反映全部生活正如一滴水反映海洋。
    虽然他不再住在乡下，他的诗的根芽依然和它深相连结，而他的心与思想也是寄托在那里的。一片土地，一把犁和一张耙——我现在想起，那就是我的家。在如今的广阔的天空下面，多少次啊，我的神思飞向儿时的家园！
    “我们时代的高爽的天空”和革命以前贫穷乡村的愁云惨雾之间的对比，便是历史的透视，没有这种透视，深刻的，严肃的诗内容便不可能。诗人的诗，尽管有着情绪上的温煦，却是睿知的，因而它的感召是普遍的。他的歌曲是他的最受欢迎的作品，是他的创作努力的顶点，它们给诗人带来声誉，它们给诗人以自由驰骋其心灵的样式。但是伊氏的诗并不只限于歌曲。
    诗人描绘了在革命的幸福光芒照射之下的俄国乡村的转变，他关切这一块宝贵的土地的护卫工作，他的作品的思想性与感召力就存在于这种关切之中；所以，很自然地，诗人甚至在和平时期中，就把他的许多诗章献给守卫边境的战士们，海军和空军们，而在战时，他就号召全国人民起来保卫国土。
    标志着他的作品最初阶段的，是描写他的生活的熟悉场景的意图，以及那些场景在革命之后所经历的变化。他描画过一个场面，这个场面，乍看起来，似乎具有叶赛宁的风韵：穿过牧场和沟壑流着琥珀色的恬静的溪流，斑驳的阳光在那里闪烁，杨柳也投影在里头。
    （伊萨柯夫斯基）琥珀色的云织成的锦带，在森林上空飘起；睡意朦胧的日午的静寂里，松树在窃窃私语。
    （叶赛宁）
    这些诗句可能出于同一诗人之手，特别是因为音律和均匀的节奏之相象。但这只是最初的印象。二者诗中的意象的综合则完全不同。在叶诗中，修道院和教堂的尖塔是景色中必备的风物，还有“草樱把它们的香气送过草原”……而在伊诗中：一片微笑的光，点亮了乡村学校的窗；一只乌鸦昂然地走过池塘，仿照着拖拉机司机的模样。
    在伊萨柯夫斯基诗中，学校是常见的。他的最好的最动人的一首诗，“冬日的黄昏”，就是献给一位乡村教师的。现在风暴正有加无已，包裹着田野的是雪和阴霾，而你在光明而欢愉的屋子里，劳作得更加勤快。
    该诗是以这种深刻的，高度抒情的诗句结尾的：风雪埋没了所有的途径，抹去了一切的疆界，而你的孤寂的窗口的灯，把光芒远远地投入深夜。
    伊萨柯夫斯基讲的是学校的光，作为他的乡村之特征的对于知识的渴求，但这一切，在叶赛宁的诗中不起任何作用。也许两位诗人都有与乡村生活隔绝之感。但在伊氏：丧失了一个农人的所有权利，我依然是一个村童。
    而叶赛宁是觉得这里不再需要诗，正如不再需要我自己。
    这样的一种自白，绝不会出于伊氏之口。他看出了为人民服务的生活意义以及他的诗的需要。叶氏把他自己叫做“乡村诗人的最末一个”，他不能理解或者接受乡村在其发展中所采取的道路，但是伊氏却有充分的资格去把自己叫做第一位集体农庄诗人。因此，在情调和语气上，两人的诗便有了差别。伊氏的诗是勇敢的，有目标的，乐观的，它的视线对着未来：前面的路向前伸延穿过闹嚷的麦田，不管你的愿望是在哪里，你不久总会达到目的。
    一九三一年国家出版局印行了他的诗选，他在序言中解释说：
    “我努力提高并传播革命带给乡村的新的一切，而不牺牲我的艺术。”这种目标要求新的艺术方法。具体的题材帮助他把意象弄得清楚明白。在同一篇序言中，伊氏说：“我觉得，要使一首诗能够被人理解，被人把握得住，它就必须说出一个故事来。也许那是最简单的，最明显的故事，但一定得有一个。”
    战争爆发了，诗人把他的字句炼成一种武器。他的眼光四射：跟着从斯摩棱斯克撤退的难民，跟着被毁灭的村镇，跟着在奴役中憔悴的姑娘们，跟着森林中的游击队，跟着在战斗和休息中的红军们。他明白各处的人们需要那种歌，借以倾吐他们的悲哀，承受战争的艰苦；需要这种作家，他带着信心和良知来帮助人民了解他们的处境和历史任务。
    人们委托诗人代他们发言，于是伊萨柯夫斯基把人民的苦恼以及他们的求胜的意志注入他们的诗中：就让这些辛酸的眼泪变成一条炙人的火流吧。国家通过母亲的嘴问战士说：爱儿啊，你的妻子呢？…………………………我的孩子，你的妈妈被剥夺了面包，土地，家。
    诗人找到了难以形容的温柔和悲哀的语调，但却以同样的声音号召人们起来战斗：听我说，我的儿，你要第一个加入战斗。
    一九四一年，敌人侵入腹地，诗人肯定地说：我们的国家坚强而有力；胜利是一定的。
    他在苏维埃国家和集体农场的制度的难以战胜的力量中看见了这种胜利的现实性。我们把我们集体农庄的食粮给了我们的可爱的国家。
    “为每一间茅屋而战！”他激动说。他描绘了英雄主义，不仅是战线上那些人们的，而且是单纯的集体农民的，老人们的英雄主义。一个老女人决心要把她自己的茅屋烧掉，因为敌兵正在屋里睡觉。这个决心并不是容易下的。精神上，她要求她的当兵的儿子的原谅，因为她不能替他保卫他爸爸的家宅。
    既然战争来了，那么每人都得作战。
    伊萨柯夫斯基透露了全民战争的意义。以前，诗人看见过在斯大林的理想的光辉烛照之下和平时期的努力的道路，和以前一样，诗人现在看见，胜利之路是和斯大林的名字分不开的。向苏维埃国家的这位伟大的领袖，伊氏说出这样挚爱的感情：我们感谢你，为了多样的成就，为了费尽心力而完成的工作。当逼近的敌人宣称我们业已失败，我们感谢你，为了你的稳妥的扶助。亲爱的斯大林同志，我们相信你，更甚于相信我们自己。
    写于一九四五的这几句诗应和了一九三六年他写的“斯大林之歌”：他带给我力量和光荣，还有未来的长年的青春，一个美丽的黎明的红晕横陈在我们的天空。那么扬起我们的声音，向着我们热爱的人唱一支歌向正义，向太阳，向斯大林歌唱。
    尽管伊氏的诗看起来好象十分单纯清楚，但实际并不简单。那是他的善于掌握方法和辛勤的工作的结果。用以连串诗句的那些线络在诗人的作品中是看不见的，捶炼的功力也是觉察不出来的。我们只能从他的作品所达到的完美的程度来揣测他的功夫。伊氏诗歌的简明和真正通俗的性质不是一下子就得到的。他工作得很努力，有时一首诗写了许多年，或者同一个主题写出许多首不同的诗。“四愿”的写作时期是一九二八到一九三五，而“在大路上”则完全是“大路之歌”的改写。伊氏的创作方法，很清楚地反映在他的改写中。“大路之歌”有十三节，“在大路上”只有十一节，可是质变胜过了量变。“在大路上”的第二节修正本里，意象更鲜明了，空泛的地方都被删去。在“大路之歌”里，我们看见：离开车站，走过果园，山谷便出现在眼前，我走着，满怀欣喜，走向我一度熟悉的村子。
    这里“果园”不是重要的。在诗里它不起什么作用。修正本是这样的：一个青色晶莹的早晨，满怀着怡然自得的心情，我离开车站慢慢吞吞走向我一度熟悉的乡村。
    分析这首诗的语言，我们可以看见第一次版本中有许多采自新的乡村词汇的特殊用语。其中有些是具有活力的，而且已被纳入一般用语和文学中，但有很多以后都被淘汰……伊萨柯夫斯基常常使用叠句或者民歌中以及革命歌曲中的句子。如“四愿”中的“我用眼泪拌饭吃”，献给西班牙妇女的“母亲”中“翻山越岭”等等。然而他借自别人的句子绝不是机械地搀进他自己的诗中。当他说：翻山，越岭师团向前推进。
    我们强烈地意识到和西班牙共和党人之间的革命的血肉关系。同样地，一首古老的革命歌曲规定了他写给列宁夫人的“告别之歌”的格调。别了，亲爱的同志，你忠实地走过了光辉的荣誉的道路。
    虽然歌曲是伊氏艺术的最高成就，但它们并没有使他立时就获致一个卓越的地位。他的“地球的主人”是根据平常说话的口语和朗诵诗的原则写成的。这是伊氏的最差的一本，充满了抽象的词句，缺乏意象，而作者在措词遣字上，有时又不忠实于他的本来的情趣和感情。后来，伊氏对自己要求得更苛刻，更严厉了，特别是在他发现歌曲的写作是他的真正事业之后。他的歌曲的风格是逐渐发展起来的，以模拟民歌开始，譬如“送你回家”：放一个手风琴在我的手里，让音乐滚滚地流。小伙子送他的情人回家；他们作了一次甜蜜的漫游。
    但伊萨柯夫斯基的最好的歌，“柳蒲西卡”，“卡秋莎”，“边境的守卫”等则是优秀的，不可模拟的。它们只借用旧民歌中的某些结构的原则，比如，排句，而内容与意象则是新的。这些歌的感动力，存在于它们的优异的俄国性质。读者觉得，一个俄国人不能再用别的什么方法说出那件事来。伊氏的语言是从俄国古典文学的熔炉里铸炼出来的，但却保存了天真的新鲜和通俗的成语。诗句带有那么多的音乐性，你不是要读它们，而是要唱它们。而且这些歌所述说的东西，绝不是革命的以前，我们祖父时代的那种古老的俄国民歌所能表现的，因为古老民歌所具有的生活概念，和苏维埃人民如今体验的生活概念完全不同了。
    人民已经接受了这些歌，把它们当作自己的东西，这是一个诗人所能得到的最高的荣誉与褒奖。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　（一九四九，十一，一·译自ＶＯＫＳ）
