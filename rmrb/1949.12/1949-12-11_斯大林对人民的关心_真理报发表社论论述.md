Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 10th: The True Light newspaper published an editorial on the 9th, discussing Stalin's concern for the people, stating:

　　The party of Lenin and Stalin constantly demonstrates concern for satisfying all the spiritual and material needs of the Soviet people. The socialist and capitalist economic systems are completely different. Socialism is unimaginable without the government's constant concern for increasing the material well-being and cultural level of working men and women. And this concern is the law of socialist development. The victory of the socialist system in all aspects of the national economy has eliminated the exploitation of man by man, and created a new socialist economy, without crisis and unemployment, without poverty and destruction, enabling citizens to have every possibility of obtaining a better and more prosperous life. The victorious implementation of several Stalin Five-Year Plans before the war had already unprecedentedly improved the welfare of the broadest masses. Now, in the post-war period, the living standards of the working people are increasing at an even greater speed.

　　Stalin's concern for the Soviet people is clearly manifested in the consistent policy of reducing consumer prices implemented by the Party and the government. Due to this policy, the people have benefited by 157 billion rubles in the past two years. The large-scale construction of houses also proves the increasing concern of the Party and the government for the Soviet people. During the period of the post-war Five-Year Plan, more than 61 million square meters of living space have been built and repaired in cities and workers' residential areas. During the same period, more than 20,000 houses have also been repaired or newly built in rural areas for collective farmers and rural intellectuals. Attention to public education and public health, assistance to mothers with many children, and assistance to the elderly and those disabled by war or labor are increasing year by year. This year alone, the Soviet state's appropriations for social and cultural undertakings have reached more than 119 billion rubles.

　　The lives of working people in capitalist countries are very different. Taking the United States as an example, military expenditure is 26 times that of public education and health expenditure. Long-term unemployment is a terrible epidemic for the working people of capitalist countries. The Soviet Union does not know the terror of unemployment. The doors to any aspect of human endeavor are wide open to Soviet citizens. The energy, knowledge and ability of the Soviet people need not worry about having no place to use them. The party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin himself, show all our organizations – the Party, the Soviets, trade unions, and enterprises – a captivating example of loving the people (who are the builders of communist society).

### 斯大林对人民的关心　真理报发表社论论述

　　斯大林对人民的关心
  　真理报发表社论论述
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于九日发表社论，论述斯大林对人民的关心称：
    列宁和斯大林的党，对于满足苏联人民精神上和物质上的一切需要，表示经常的关心。社会主义和资本主义经济制度完全不同，假如没有政府对增进劳动男女的物质福利和文化水平的不断关心，社会主义便是不能想象的。而这种关心，则是社会主义发展的规律。社会主义制度在国民经济各方面的胜利，消灭了人剥削人，并造成了新的社会主义经济，没有危机和失业，没有贫穷和毁灭，使公民们有一切可能得到更美好更丰裕的生活。战前几次斯大林五年计划的胜利实现，已经史无前例地增进了最广大群众的福利。现在，在战后的时期中，劳动人民的生活水准正以更大的速度提高着。
    斯大林对苏联人民的关心，已清楚地表现在党和政府所实行的减低消费品价格这种一贯的政策上。由于这种政策，人民已在过去两年内得到了一千五百七十亿卢布的利益。大规模地建造房屋，也证明了党和政府对苏联人民有增无已的关心。在战后五年计划的时期中，在城市与工人住宅区，已经建造和修缮了六千一百万平方公尺以上的居住面积。同一时期中，在乡村也为集体农民与乡村知识分子修复或新建了两万所以上的房屋。对公共教育和公共卫生的注意，对儿女多的母亲的援助，对老年人和因战争或劳动而残废的人的援助，都一年年地增加。光是今年，苏维埃国家对社会与文化事业的拨款，就已达一千一百九十亿卢布以上。
    资本主义国家劳动人民的生活，那就大不相同了。以美国为例，军费相当于公共教育与卫生开支的二十六倍。长期的失业，是资本主义国家劳动人民一种可怕的疫病。苏联就不晓得失业的恐怖，需要人类进行努力的任何方面的大门，都在苏联公民面前大大敞开着，苏联人民的精力、知识与能力，都不愁没有用武之地。列宁和斯大林的党，苏维埃政府，斯大林同志本人，都给我们一切的组织——党、苏维埃、工会及企业——显示出爱人民（他们是共产主义社会的建设者）的富于感召力的榜样。
