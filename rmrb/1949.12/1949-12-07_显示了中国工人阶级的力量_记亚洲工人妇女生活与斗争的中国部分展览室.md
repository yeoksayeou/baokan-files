　　Showcasing the Strength of the Chinese Working Class
    ——On the China Section of the Exhibition of the Life and Struggle of Asian Workers and Women
    Chen Ji
    In the China section of the exhibition hall dedicated to the life and struggle of workers, the heroic struggle of Chinese workers over the past twenty years vividly tells us that the victory of the Chinese people was achieved through an extremely difficult and tortuous path. Starting from the photo of Comrade Li Dazhao, who, in 1922, served as the head of the Northern Bureau of the Chinese Labor Union Secretariat and went to Shijiazhuang to organize workers under the name of the Zhengtai Industrial Research Institute, establishing the Zhengtai Railway General Union, up to the recent photo of Ji Gengsheng, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike in Shijiazhuang, being elected as a member of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government, we see the heroic history of the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, continuously fighting against imperialism. In 1922, the Chinese seamen in Hong Kong went on strike to oppose the British closure of the General Union and demand wage increases. Despite numerous difficulties, they organized more than 65,000 workers, acted in unison, and persisted for fifty days before resuming work. The heroic posture of the heroes who participated in the strike still gives people strength. The photo of Hong Kong workers responding to the Shanghai workers' strike reminds people of the glorious history of the May Thirtieth Movement, launched by Chinese workers twenty-four years ago to oppose British imperialism. At that time, Chinese workers shouted the battle cry: "Down with imperialism!" British imperialism in Hong Kong lost 7 million Hong Kong dollars per month due to the Chinese workers' strike, which lasted for two years and three months. When more than 60,000 Chinese workers withdrew from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, British imperialism was panic-stricken and, for the first time on the desolate Hong Kong island, recognized the strength of the Chinese working class. In front of the photo of Comrade Luo Yining, one of the Chinese worker leaders, being killed, a young worker said: "We must eliminate the reactionaries completely!" What followed was a picture of the Chinese working class following the great Chairman Mao to the countryside, organizing peasants, overthrowing feudalism, strengthening their armed forces, and establishing base areas. People saw that, under extremely difficult conditions, the workers bravely supported the war for a long time. The workers in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, although lacking modern machinery, still used indigenous methods to refine scrap iron. The Taihang Arsenal used horse-drawn power, and the workers in central Hebei repaired and manufactured guns in underground caves. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the Liberation War, they worked in this way and achieved victory in this way.

    The victory was not easy to achieve, and consolidating the victory is even more difficult. The Chinese working class deeply understands this point. After we have seen the photo exhibition of the struggle of the Chinese working class before and after liberation, we constantly think about this point in our hearts. In Northeast China, in North China, in South China, in East China, and in Central China, the Chinese working class, on the eve of liberation, bravely defended their factories, resisting the sabotage of the reactionaries. After liberation, they assisted the People's Government in taking over and inventorying, and offered valuable equipment that had been preserved for many years. Today, they are again unfolding the production struggle with the attitude of masters, and "Increase work efficiency!" "Improve product quality!" have become their slogans of struggle.

    In terms of the production struggle, we see the heroic posture of Zhang Zifu, a shock worker in Fushun coal mines. Wearing an old cotton-padded coat and carrying an iron shovel, he once led ten thousand workers to complete shock tasks, increasing work efficiency by one-third. The Kuomintang bandit gangs had shamelessly destroyed bridges and railways, dreaming of using this method of destruction to obstruct the victory of the Chinese people; however, the Chinese workers' answer to them was: "Wherever the Liberation Army fights, the railway is built there!" In just a few months, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which had been out of service for more than ten years, was opened to traffic. The thousands of miles of the Longhai Railway have been repaired, and the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways running north and south are also about to be connected. When the photos of the repaired bridges and railways shine before people's eyes, people more truly see the great strength of the Chinese working class. When repairing the Xixi River Forward Bridge in Ganxian, Jiangxi, the workers completed three months of work in seventeen days. Wang Huasheng, a veteran worker of Fushun Shengli Mine, invented a tool for manufacturing spikes, which enabled each person to manufacture 650 spikes per day, increasing work efficiency six times compared to the past. These are just two examples in the photo exhibition. In the new China, we will discover millions of such examples. On the eve of welcoming the high tide of economic construction, the workers of the new China are advancing bravely, and they will surely successfully complete their great historical task.

　　显示了中国工人阶级的力量
    ——记亚洲工人妇女生活与斗争的中国部分展览室
    陈迹
    在中国部分的工人生活与斗争的展览室里，二十多年来中国工人的英勇斗争历史，活生生地告诉我们：中国人民的胜利是经过了非常困难曲折的道路的。从一九二二年李大钊同志担任中国劳动组合书记部北方负责人，去石家庄以正太工业研究所名义组织工人、成立正太铁路总工会的照片起，到最近石家庄的“二七”老工人计根生当选为石家庄市政府委员的照片止，我们看见了中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下一直为反对帝国主义而奋斗的英勇史迹。一九二二年，香港的中国海员工人为反对英国封闭总工会并要求加薪而罢工，他们在困难重重之下，组织了六万五千多工人，一致行动，坚持了五十天，才恢复工作。参加罢工的英雄们的雄姿，至今仍然给人们以力量。香港工人响应上海工人罢工的照片使人们想起二十四年前中国工人为反对英帝国主义而掀起的五卅运动的光荣历史。在那时，中国工人喊出了战斗的声音：“打倒帝国主义！”香港英帝国主义因中国工人两年零三个月时间的罢工，每月损失七百万港币。当六万多中国工人从香港撤至广州时，英帝惊慌失措，在凄凉的香港荒岛上，第一次认识了中国工人阶级的力量。在中国工人领袖之一的罗亦农同志被杀的照片之前，一位年青工人说：“我们一定要把反动派消灭干净！”接下去便是中国工人阶级跟随着伟大的毛主席走到农村去，组织农民，推翻封建，壮大自己武装力量，建立根据地的图景。人们看到在极端困难的条件下，工人们长期地奋勇支援战争。陕甘宁的工人们虽然没有近代化的机器，但他们仍利用土办法，一样地炼了废铁。太行兵工厂用马拉机动力，冀中工人在地洞内修制枪械。在八年抗战中，在三年解放战争中，他们就是这样地工作，这样地取得了胜利。
    胜利的取得是不容易的，巩固胜利更不容易。中国工人阶级深深地知道这一点。当我们看过了解放前后的中国工人阶级的斗争情形的照片展览后，我们心里不时地想着这一点。在东北，在华北，在华南，在华东，在华中，中国工人阶级在解放前夕，都奋不顾身地保卫他们的工厂，抗拒了反动派的破坏。在解放以后，他们协助人民政府接管、清点、纷纷献出保存了多年的宝贵器材。今天，他们又以主人翁的姿态，紧张地展开了生产斗争，“提高工作效率！”“提高产品质量！”成了他们斗争的口号。
    在生产斗争方面，我们看到抚顺煤工突击手张子富的英雄姿态。他穿着旧棉袄，带着铁锹，曾推动一万工人完成突击任务，使工作效率提高三分之一。国民党匪帮曾经无耻地破坏了桥梁、铁路，梦想以这种破坏方法来阻挠中国人民的胜利；但是，中国工人给他们的答复是：“解放军打到那里，铁路修到那里！”短短的几个月时间，十多年来未通车的京沪路通车了。长达数千里的陇海路修复了，纵横南北的京汉与粤汉路也要接通了。当一座座修好的桥梁、铁路的照片闪耀在人们眼前时，人们更真确地看到了中国工人阶级的巨大力量。在修复江西赣县西河进军大桥时，工人们以十七天时间完成了三个月的任务。抚顺胜利矿老工人王化盛发明制造道钉的工具，使每人每天可制造道钉六百五十个，比过去工作效率提高了六倍。这仅仅是照片展览里的两个例子。在新中国里，我们将发现千万个这样的例子。在这迎接经济建设高潮的前夕，新中国工人正在奋勇前进，他们一定能胜利完成他们伟大的历史任务。
