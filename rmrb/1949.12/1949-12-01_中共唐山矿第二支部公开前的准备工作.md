Preparation Work Before the Public Disclosure of the Second Branch of the CCP Tangshan Mine

The Second Branch of the CCP Tangshan Mine was made public on October 22nd, and other branches will be made public successively. In order to promote experience, we would like to put forward the experience of this preparation for research.

I. Ideological Preparation and Work Preparation within the Party

First, dispel concerns within the Party, carry out self-criticism, and repeatedly conduct education to explain the meaning and benefits of making the Party public, so that every Party member can thoroughly understand it. At the beginning, Party members had many concerns: 1. They were afraid that it would be inconvenient to approach the masses after the disclosure; 2. They were afraid of being asked questions by the masses due to low theoretical level, which would be embarrassing; 3. Party members with bad work styles were afraid of being criticized by the masses and distrusted by the Party; 4. Individual Party members were afraid of assassination by special agents. The most effective way to dispel concerns is to discuss the meaning of making the Party public. The Second Branch of Tangshan Mine held two branch meetings and four group discussions, and finally the Party committee made a summary. In order to overcome the concerns about approaching the masses, it was explained that the purpose of approaching the masses was to solve the problems of the masses, and the idea of being timid and hesitant must be broken. If you feel that your theoretical level is low and you cannot help the masses better to answer questions, you should strengthen your study and improve yourself. If you can’t answer the questions of the masses, you can study them together with the masses, or you can ask the higher authorities. Party members with bad work styles should strive to overcome their shortcomings and be determined to correct them, and the Party will cherish and trust them. Accepting criticism from the masses will not only not reduce the Party's prestige, but will also increase the Party's prestige. As for the fear of being harmed by special agents, as long as vigilance is heightened and the masses are mobilized to report, the conspiracy of special agents to assassinate will be shattered. The above issues have been resolved through criticism and self-criticism of Party members, which not only dispelled concerns but also raised thinking a step further.

The most important work preparation within the Party is to summarize the work of the branch, which can not only educate Party members, but also educate the broad masses. The summary includes what the branch has done for the people since its establishment, what shortcomings it has, and the future work plan. Within the Party, it can be checked which Party members are excellent and have made great achievements, and who has prestige among the masses, and which Party members have more shortcomings, so that they can be announced to the masses during the public disclosure, so that the masses can clearly understand what achievements the Party has made and what struggles it has led. Announcing the shortcomings of the Party's work will also make the masses realize that the Communist Party is seeking truth from facts. However, this work must pay attention to the authenticity of the materials, otherwise it will affect the unity within the Party and the prestige of the Party. Therefore, it must be summarized by all Party members, first in groups and then in the branch. As for Party members with many shortcomings who need to apologize to the masses, they must be cultivated to maturity and have their thinking straightened out. In addition, when summarizing achievements, on the one hand, it is necessary to emphasize the leading role of the Party, and on the other hand, it is necessary to emphasize the strength of the masses and commend activists among the masses, so as to make the relationship between the Party and the masses more united. When carrying out the above work, the Second Branch, due to insufficient preparation within the Party, resulted in an insufficient review and less criticism from the masses.

II. Preparation Work Among the Masses

It must be matured among the masses. First of all, it should be recognized that making the Party public must have a mass propaganda movement, and various methods should be adopted to carry out propaganda and education, so that the masses have a correct understanding of the Party. The content includes the nature of the Communist Party, why the Party should be made public, the relationship between the Party and the masses after the public disclosure, the attitude of the masses towards the Party, etc., so that the masses realize that the Chinese Communist Party is bright and great; but the shortcomings of Party members should be explained to the masses, which are brought from the old society, are partial, and are temporary. The Party is constantly educating and gradually overcoming them, and welcomes the masses' well-intentioned criticism and supervision in order to seek progress. The purpose of this work is to make every worker understand the close relationship between making the Party public and his own interests, so as to achieve the purpose of caring for and helping the Party. In this regard, Tangshan Mine did a relatively poor job. It only summoned branch committee members and group leaders to study in three shifts during their daily spare time, for a total of seven days. Although it was very effective, the written propaganda was not enough. For example, the wall newspaper was not drafted, so that some workers did not know about this matter, and there was little criticism from the masses at the public disclosure meeting.

III. Public Disclosure of the Party's Organizational Leadership

Before the public disclosure, it is necessary to organize activists outside the Party. Its role is: 1. It can explain the Party's achievements to the masses and improve the masses' understanding of the Party; 2. It can take the lead or encourage other workers to conduct well-intentioned criticism of the Party's shortcomings; 3. In the event of attacks or slanders against the Party by special agents, it can expose them to educate the masses. Tangshan Mine has been more successful in this aspect. In addition to general education in the Communist Youth League and the trade union, it has also cultivated activists. It has held two League member meetings to explain that the League is a youth organization under the leadership of the Party and is the Party's assistant, and should care for and cherish the Party. After the above work, more than 30 backbones were cultivated in the Communist Youth League, which drove the masses to express their opinions and their enthusiasm was very high. At the public disclosure meeting of the Party, 25 people requested to join the Party.

Unify the strength of various departments within the Party. It should be recognized that the work of making the Party public is the task of the entire Party, not just a matter for the Organization Department. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, all cadres should be mobilized to complete this work.

### 中共唐山矿第二支部公开前的准备工作

　　中共唐山矿第二支部公开前的准备工作
    中共唐山矿第二支部已于十月二十二日公开，其他支部即将陆续公开。为了推广经验，愿将此次准备工作经验，提出研究。
    一、党内思想酝酿和工作准备
    首先在党内打破顾虑，开展自我批评，反复进行教育，说明公开党的意义及好处，使每一个党员达到彻底了解。开始时，党员顾虑很多：一、怕公开后接近群众不方便；二、理论低，怕群众问，答不出，丢人；三、作风坏的党员怕群众指责，党不信任；四、个别党员怕特务暗杀。解除顾虑最有效的办法是讨论公开党的意义，唐山矿二支部曾开支部大会二次，小组讨论四次，最后由党委作了总结。为了打破对接近群众的顾虑，说明接近群众的目的是为了解决群众问题，必须打破小手小脚的思想束缚。如果觉得理论水平低，不能更好的帮助群众解答问题，就应该加强学习，提高自己。群众的问题有解答不出来的可以和群众一起研究，还可以去问上级。作风不好的党员只要努力克服缺点，决心改正，党是爱护与信任的。接受群众批评，不但不能降低党的威信，反倒能提高党的威信。至于怕特务暗害问题，只要提高警惕性，发动群众检举，就会粉碎特务的暗害阴谋。以上问题，都经过了党员的批评与自我批评获得解决，这不但解除了顾虑，并且把思想提高了一步。
    党内工作准备最重要的是总结支部工作，这不单能教育党员，并且能教育广大群众。总结的内容包括支部从建立以来为人民作了那些事情，还有那些缺点，以及今后工作计划。在党内可以检查那个党员优秀，成绩大，是在群众中有威信，那个党员缺点多，以便在公开时向群众宣布，使群众清楚地认识党有那些成绩，领导过那些斗争，而公布党的工作的缺点，群众也会认识到共产党是实事求是的。但这一工作必须注意材料真实、否则影响党内团结与党的威信。因此必须是全体党员来总结，先小组后支部。至于缺点多的党员，需要向群众道歉的，必须培养成熟，搞通思想。此外，在总结成绩时，一方面要强调党的领导作用，同时要强调群众力量，表扬群众中的积极分子，以便使党与群众的关系更趋团结。在进行上述工作时，二支部由于党内准备不足，结果检讨不深刻，群众对党批评亦少。
    二、群众中的准备工作
    必须在群众中酝酿成熟。首先应该认识到公开党必须有一个群众宣传运动，应采取各种方法宣传教育，使群众对党有正确认识，内容包括共产党的性质，党为什么要公开，公开后党与群众关系，群众对党的态度等，使群众认识到中国共产党是光明的，伟大的；但党员的缺点应该向群众说明，这是从旧社会带来的，是部分的，是暂时的，党正不断教育，逐步克服，欢迎群众善意批评、监督，求得进步。这一工作的目的，在于使每个工人了解到公开党与他本人的切身关系，达到关心党帮助党的目的。在这一点上，唐山矿作的较差，只是召集支会委员、小组长在每日工余时间，分三班轮流学习，共学习七天，虽然收效很大，但文字宣传还不够，如壁报未稿起来，致使一些工人不知道有此事，公开大会群众批评少。
    三、公开党的组织领导
    在公开以前，必须在党外组织积极分子，其作用是：一、可以把党的成绩向群众说明，提高群众的对党的认识；二、可以带头或鼓励其他工友对党的缺点进行善意批评；三、遇有特务分子打击或污蔑党，可以予以揭露，以教育群众。唐山矿在这一方面作的较成功，在青年团及工会中除一般教育外，并培养积极分子，开了二次团员大会，说明团是在党领导下的青年组织，是党的助手，应当关心党，爱护党。经过上述各项工作，在青年团中培养骨干三十多人，带动了群众发表意见，情绪很高，在公开党的大会上，要求入党的二十五人。
    在党内统一各部门力量，应认识到公开党的工作是全党的任务，不单纯是组织部一部门的事，应该在党委领导下，动员全体干部完成这一工作。
