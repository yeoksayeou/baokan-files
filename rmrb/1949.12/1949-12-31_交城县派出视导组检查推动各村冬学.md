　　Jiaocheng County Dispatches Inspection Teams to Check and Promote Winter Studies in Various Villages
    [This News] Winter study movements in Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, have been widely launched. A total of 160 winter schools have been established in 122 administrative villages throughout the county, with more than 8,700 young and middle-aged men and women enrolled, and the number of students is continuing to expand. The dispatching of inspection teams to villages has played a significant role in achieving this result. After the county government issued instructions on winter studies on the 16th of last month, on the 18th, the county government and other departments drew 18 cadres to form five winter study inspection teams, which went to various districts to inspect and guide the work. In Gujiao Town, in the seventh district, the inspection teams helped winter school teachers solve teaching difficulties. First, they guided them to select teaching materials from newspapers, and then personally taught five lessons as teaching demonstrations for the winter school teachers. For some smaller natural villages that could not establish winter schools, the inspection teams helped them establish study groups, selecting a more enthusiastic person from the participating masses as the group leader, who would regularly go to the winter school in the administrative village to study, and then come back to teach everyone. In the seventh district alone, more than 30 such study groups were established. The inspection teams also promptly discovered and publicized exemplary cases of better winter study movements in various places to promote winter study work in other areas. For example, Liang Dechang, director of the farmers' association in Daying Village, ninth district, and Zhou Sanqin, women's committee member, took the lead in enrolling in winter school themselves and persuaded the masses from door to door, mobilizing more than 100 people in the village to attend winter school within a few days; primary school teachers in Lijiashe Village, seventh district, enthusiastically taught winter school and mobilized young and middle-aged people to attend winter school without affecting their school work. The inspection teams promptly publicized and commended these exemplary cases, which had a great impact on other village cadres and teachers, and increased their enthusiasm.

　　交城县派出视导组检查推动各村冬学
    【本报讯】山西省交城县冬学运动已普遍开展，全县一百二十二个行政村建立了冬学一百六十处，入学青壮年男女达八千七百余人，学员仍在继续扩大。这一成绩的获得，视导组的下乡推动起了很大作用。当上月十六日县府发出冬学指示后，十八日即由县府等部门抽出干部十八人组成五个冬学视导组，分赴各区检查、指导。视导组在七区古交镇等地曾帮助冬学教员解决了教学上的困难。首先指导其从报纸上选择教材，又亲自代课五次，给冬学教员作教学示范。对一些较小的不能成立冬学的自然村，视导组便帮助其成立学习小组，从参加小组的群众中选一个较热心的人当组长，定期到行政村的冬学里学习，回来再教大家。这样的学习小组，仅七区即成立了三十几个。视导组并及时发现了各地冬学运动中较好的模范事例，宣传表扬，以推动其他地方的冬学工作。如九区大营村农会主任梁德昌、妇女委员周三亲等首先自己入冬学，并挨门逐户说服群众，数日内推动全村百余人上冬学；七区李家社等村小学教师热心教冬学，并在不妨碍学校工作情形下到群众中去动员青壮年上冬学；对这些模范事例，视导组均及时进行了宣传表扬，这对其他村干部、教员影响很大，提高了他们的积极性。
