　　Qingdao Business Community Discusses Purchasing Public Bonds
  　Cold Storage Company Director Pre-Purchases 200 Shares
    [Special dispatch from our Qingdao correspondent on the 24th] Following the ship repair and maritime workers, the Qingdao business community is enthusiastically supporting the Central People's Government's issuance of People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds. More than 150 representatives from over ten units, including banks, money shops, insurance companies, tea merchants, petroleum companies, traditional Chinese medicine shops, Western medicine shops, grocery stores, and grain stores, held a symposium on the 23rd. They unanimously agreed that the Central People's Government's issuance of People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds is a brilliant decision to overcome financial difficulties, strive for national victory, and develop production. Grain store representative Jiang Jianfu said: "We must use the practical action of subscribing to demonstrate the Qingdao business community's support for the government's policies. We must not lag behind other cities." Tea merchant representative Tan said: "The issuance of Victory Bonds can limit price fluctuations, which can only benefit us, not harm us." After the meeting, Jiang Jianfu, the managing director of Qingdao Cold Storage Company, immediately pre-purchased 200 shares.
