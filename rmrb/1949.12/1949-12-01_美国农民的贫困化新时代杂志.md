Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: TASS Moscow: The "New Era" magazine published an article by Shi Shijin entitled "The Impoverishment of American Farmers," stating that in no other major capitalist country has the impoverishment and bankruptcy of farmers reached such a degree as in the United States. One of the major factors causing this situation is the increasingly deep penetration of financial capital into agriculture.

In the United States, on the one hand, there is the decline of the vast small farmers, and on the other hand, the wealth of rural capitalists. The total annual income of 5,000 large farms ranges from 100,000 to over 1 million yuan per household. In contrast, the average total annual income of 2.3 million small farms (38 percent of the total) does not exceed 1,000 yuan per household. Among the 30 million rural residents in the United States, 20 million live below the level of mere subsistence.

The author writes that among rural residents, Black farmers are in an even more difficult and miserable situation. In the Southern states, the mortality rate for Blacks is 50 percent higher than for whites. In the South, the percentage of Black tenant farmers in the total number of farmers increased from 35 percent in 1940 to 41 percent in 1945, and the proportion of sharecroppers (i.e., semi-slave farmers whose land, farm implements, seeds, and housing are all provided by landlords) increased from 55 percent to 62 percent.

Due to the exploitation by industrial and commercial capital, banks, and large landowners, the vast majority of farmers have become so impoverished that millions of small producers have gone bankrupt and been driven off the land, becoming vagrants. During the period from 1920 to 1945, an average of 600,000 farmers left their homes every year. According to experts, the number of farmers driven off the land will reach 4 to 6 million in the coming years. In the country of "money democracy," small farmers have only two paths to take: either to die of malnutrition and exhaustion on their small plots of land, or to join the army of vagrant laborers to die.

After World War II, American monopoly capital intensified its attack on the living standards of the people, and one of the consequences was the sharp deterioration of the fate of farmers. In the first half of this year, due to the decline in the prices of agricultural products (by June of this year, prices had fallen by 17 percent compared to the peak in January of last year), farmers' income was 1.3 billion US dollars less than in the first half of last year. In January of this year, their mortgage debt increased by 226 million US dollars compared to January of last year, reaching 5.108 billion US dollars. The author emphasizes that with the beginning of the economic crisis, the vast majority of small and medium farmers are facing new worries and disasters.

The author points out that the tax levied on farmers' income has increased from 15 million yuan in 1941 to 960 million yuan in 1949, a planned increase of 64 times. Increasing unemployment and decreasing farmer income are further reducing the purchasing power of the working masses, thus exacerbating the industrial and agricultural crises. In addition, the Marshall Plan policy, coupled with its enslaving loans and the arms race and currency devaluation, is also undermining the purchasing power of other capitalist countries. This makes the problem of the American export market (including the agricultural product market) even more serious. In 1948, the United States' grain exports were 10 percent less than the previous year, and this year shows a further decline. The surplus of wheat, cotton, and other agricultural products is increasing, while the prices of these goods are falling. The American ruling group hopes to save the situation by reducing production. But the author concludes that this method can only further inflame the large sores that are corroding the American economy and can only exacerbate the crisis.

　　美国农民的贫困化新时代杂志
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志刊载石式金所撰题为“美国农民的贫困化”一文称：在任何其它大资本主义国家里，农民的贫困化和破产，都没有达到美国那样的程度。造成这种情况的重大困素之一，是财政资本正在越来越深地渗入农业中。
    在美国，一方面是小农大众的衰微，另一方面是农村资本家的富有，五千大农户每户每年总收入为十万元到一百万元以上不等。与此对照，二百三十万小农户（占总数百分之三十八）每户每年平均总收入不超过一千元。在美国三千万农村居民中，二千万人生活在仅仅维持生存的水平之下。
    作者写道，在农村居民中，黑人农民处于更艰苦的惨境中。在南方诸州，黑人的死亡率比白人高百分之五十。在南方，黑人佃农在农民总数中所占的百分比，从一九四零年的百分之三十五增至一九四五年的百分之四十一，伙种者（即土地、农具、种子、居室均由地主供给的半奴隶性的农民）所占的比例数，则从百分之五十五增至百分之六十二。
    由于工商业资本、银行和大地主的盘剥，农民大众已穷到如此地步，以致数以百万计的小生产者破了产，并被人从土地上赶走，变成了流浪者。在一九二零年到一九四五年期间，平均每年有六十万农民背井离乡。据专家估计，这种被从土地上赶走的农民，今后数年内将达四百至六百万。在“金元民主主义”的国度里，小农只有两条路可走：要就是因营养不良与精疲力竭而死在他们的小块地上，要就是参加到处流浪的劳动者大军里死去。
    在第二次世界大战之后，美国垄断资本对人民的生活水平加紧进攻，其后果之一是农民命运的急剧恶化。今年上半年，由于农产品的价格下跌（迄至今年六月，价格已较去年一月的最高峰下降百分之十七），农民收入比去年上半年少了十三亿美元。今年一月，他们的抵押债务则比去年一月增加了二亿二千六百万元，达五十一亿零八百万元。作者强调指出，随着经济危机的开始，小农与中农大众又面临着新的忧患和灾难。
    作者指出：对农民收入所课的税收，从一九四一年的一千五百万元增至一九四九年的九亿六千万元，计划加了六十四倍。越来越多的失业，和越来少的农民收入，正在更进一步地减少劳苦大众的购买力，因而更加剧了工业危机和农业危机。此外，马歇尔计划的政策加上它的奴役性的贷款与军备运动及货币贬值，也在破坏着其它资本主义国家的购买力。这使得美国的输出市场（包括农产品市场）问题更加严重了。一九四八年，美国的粮食出口即比前一年少百分之十，今年则显示着更进一步的降低。小麦、棉花及其它农产品的过剩越来越多，而这些货物的价格又在下跌。美国统治集团希望用减少生产的办法来挽救。但作者在结语中说，这种办法只能使正在腐蚀着美国经济的大疮更进一步发炎，只能使危机加剧。
