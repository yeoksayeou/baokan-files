　　On "Conditions Permitting"
    Li Jing
    After entering the city, especially among some cadres who have implemented the salary system, a tendency towards enjoyment and extravagance has grown. Some people are particularly particular about eating and drinking, dissatisfied with communal meals, and often go to small restaurants; some are particularly particular about dressing, unwilling to go out on the street unless they are dressed "beautifully." The theoretical basis for these people is: now that conditions permit, the rural style must be changed, wasn't the revolution for the purpose of living a good life?

    Of course, from the countryside to the city, there must be a major shift in lifestyle. For example, in the countryside, people don't pay much attention to time, but in the city, they must learn to do things according to a certain schedule; in the countryside, people haven't used water and electricity, but in the city, they must get used to using water and electricity. All of this requires us to thoroughly change from thought to action. Changing the "rural style" is by no means abandoning the fine traditions of hard work and simplicity.

    Of course, the revolution is for the purpose of making life better, for the purpose of enabling all the people to live a good life, not just a few people. The Communist Party and the revolutionary cadres under its leadership are rooted in the masses, and no phenomenon of detachment from the masses is allowed. At present, the masses are generally suffering, especially in Central China, where most areas have just been liberated, the front line is fighting, and the rear needs strong support; the only industry has suffered the cruel destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs, and many areas are suffering from floods, and farmers have no food to eat. Do these real "conditions" still "permit" us to talk about enjoyment? At the same time, this is not just a matter of spending a few more or less money, but more seriously reflects the ideological situation that is the root cause of these phenomena. It is very dangerous for a person not to think about how to improve themselves politically and complete their work tasks, but to always focus on the details of life and material enjoyment.

    It is a well-known story that Lenin, the great teacher of the world proletariat, wore a patched coat for a long time after the October Revolution. Did the "conditions" at that time not "permit" him to wear a better coat? Unless we are willing to ruin our future, we have no reason to insist on this mistake, so let us bravely throw away the harmful excuse of "conditions permitting" and gloriously grasp the hard-working and simple style that belonged to us in the past and will continue to be carried forward now and in the future!

### 谈“条件许可”

　　谈“条件许可”
    李净
    进了城，尤其是一些实行了薪金制的干部中，滋长着一种享乐浮华的倾向，有的人特别讲究吃喝，不满意大伙饭，常下小馆；有的特别讲究穿戴，穿的不“漂亮”就不愿到街上去，这些人的理论根据是：现在条件许可了，农村作风要改改，革命还不是为了把日子过好吗？
    当然，从农村到城市，生活方式必须有一个大的转变，比方在农村不大讲究时间性，到了城市就必须学会按一定时间办事；在农村没用过水电，到城市就必须习惯于利用水电；诸如此类，对我们说来都是要从思想到行动彻底转变的。改变“农村作风”，决不是抛弃艰苦、朴素的优良传统。
    当然，革命是为了把日子过好，是为了要使人民都把日子过好，不只为了少数人，共产党及其领导下的革命干部是札根在群众当中的，不容许有脱离群众的现象。现在群众普遍都很苦，特别在华中，大部分地区都是刚解放，前线在打仗，需要后方大力支援；仅有的一点工业遭受了蒋白匪帮残酷的破坏，好多地区闹水灾，农民没有粮食吃。这些现实“条件”难道还“许可”我们去大谈享受吗？同时，这还不仅仅是多花几个钱少花几个钱的问题，更严重的是反映了作为这些现象之根源的思想情况。一个人，不想着如何在政治上提高自己，完成工作任务，老在生活细节物质享受上打主意，是很危险的。
    世界无产阶级的伟大导师列宁在十月革命后，很长一个时期还穿着带补钉的外套，这是人所周知的故事。难道当时的“条件”就不“许可”他穿一条比较好的外套吗？除非甘愿毁灭自己的前途，否则我们没有任何理由去坚持这种错误，那么让我们勇敢地扔掉“条件许可”这个有害的借口，光荣的把握住过去属于我们，现在和将来还要继续发扬的艰苦朴素作风吧！
