Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: Soong Ching Ling, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government and Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a letter to congratulate the convocation of the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Shi Liang read the congratulatory letter at the Asian Women's Representative Conference on the 11th. The summary is as follows:

　　Sisters, women of all Asia! I salute your courage and your great achievements! I warmly wish you continued progress towards complete liberation!

　　When we analyze the current situation in Asia, when we re-examine the marks left by history in our countries and peoples, we see that women and all the people have a common enemy. These enemies are foreign imperialism and the colonialism it created, as well as domestic feudalism and its modern compradorism.

　　Imperialism and feudalism plunge the majority of the people into poverty. These social tumors make human beings live like lower animals. They cannot get enough to eat, live in dilapidated houses, wear ragged clothes, and have no access to hygiene. Women and children are always the first to encounter these disasters. They are subjected to the most severe exploitation, whether working or unemployed. Even if they work hard, they can only get the lowest wages at best. In most countries, women are not educated, and where there are schools, only a few special classes can enjoy them.

　　Women are relegated to the status of slaves in society and politics, at best second-class citizens. Women are bound to household affairs, and women are seen as inferior and unworthy of learning or working. This is typical of feudalism and fascism.

　　We have long realized that Asian women will never receive the sympathy of imperialists in their struggle to liberate themselves from this tragic situation. Just look at how imperialist countries treat women at home, and this can be proved. In the eyes of wealthy men, women are nothing more than ornaments.

　　During World War II, American women made progress in liberating themselves. Due to military needs, industry expanded greatly and needed to hire millions of skilled workers who could not be hired at the time. This gave women the opportunity to participate in various industrial jobs. The future of American women seemed to be improving. But when victory was in sight, there was a widespread movement in the United States to force women to leave factories and return to the kitchen. The vast majority of trade unions also colluded with the reactionaries to participate in this activity. The high-pressure propaganda commonly used in the United States shouted: "Ladies, thank you for your help, please go back and take care of the children." Or say: "Your man has returned from the battlefield and needs you to go home. You shouldn't wear dirty worker's clothes to greet him, because in his imagination, you are dressed in gorgeous clothes!"

　　Women are treated the same elsewhere. For example, British female teachers earn 10 to 15 percent less than men.

　　So it is not surprising that we know that in all colonial countries, there is no welfare for newborn babies and pregnant women at all. The owners of factories, farms, workshops and other economic forces are also the owners of the courts. Therefore, even after the law stipulates, when they violate the law, they will obviously never be sanctioned. Imperialists and their lackeys in various countries even think that giving birth is a crime. They fire women when they are pregnant to avoid paying maternity leave allowances. They can simply prevent pregnant women from taking leave and refuse to pay the leave allowances stipulated by law.

　　We must completely eliminate these evils. This can be successful, because it is the inevitability of history, because the Asian people have friends as well as enemies. The primary friend is the true independence of the country. We use the word "true" because there are many false independence in the Far East. Although these countries shout loudly to make the world hear that they are "free," in reality this is just the cry of the imperialists who still control them.

　　As for independent countries, it is completely different. It is built on the happiness of the people and with the full support of the people. It is a fertile ground for the democratic growth of the people.

　　Our People's Republic of China is one example. Our time has finally come. The great force of New Democracy unites all democratic classes and all democratic parties. They will strive to build a truly independent and democratic China. At the same time, women will also be liberated and enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects.

　　This has been written into our fundamental law, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Article 6 stipulates: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that binds women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life, and freedom of marriage between men and women is implemented."

　　Among the representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference that passed this fundamental law, 10 percent are women. They can participate in the formation of fundamental policies and the practical activities of economy, education and culture. They are also politically active, for example, assisting in the completion of land reform, which lays the foundation for new democracy, is one of them. Not only that, when they serve the people, their children are taken care of. Look! Since the liberation of Shanghai in May, the number of nurseries has tripled. Look! The number of various schools is constantly increasing, and the number of students in all liberated areas has also increased dramatically.

　　The second friend that colonies can seek is the world proletarian movement, that is, their international friends headed by the Soviet Union. Here, all people can be respected and treated based on equality and mutual respect. Here, all ethnic minorities and progressive fighters and the oppressed can get sympathy and help. Here, we see the precedent of women's development and their contribution to peaceful construction.

　　These two friends—national independence and the world proletarian movement—are invaluable assistance to the people and women of the world. They write women's equality into law.

　　Facts speak louder than words. The socialist system itself is proof. It will not sacrifice the interests of the people, but will only give them all kinds of care, so that they can enjoy more food, lower prices, and ensure that their future is fully developed.

　　For the people of the Far East, all this only means one thing, that is, we must learn from the Soviet Union. Our women should also learn from Soviet women when promoting culture. At the same time, the newly established democratic countries in Asia should also be able to serve as examples for the unliberated countries and women, and contribute all their experiences to them, so that they can achieve inevitable victory in the struggle.

　　Strive to fight! Asian women have fought alongside men in the army to fight for national independence, resist colonial policies and imperialism, and resist feudalism and compradorism in their own countries. They have faced death and the torture of concentration camps, and encountered all unimaginable deaths. Asian women have participated in and led strikes and demonstrations, and have sacrificed their lives with unparalleled bravery in armed uprisings. The heroic women of China, India, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia and other countries are something that women everywhere can be proud of.

　　Let the women of all Asia unite to carry out this struggle! In addition to realizing the two basic requirements of Asia, national independence and freedom, let us fight for the following rights: women should have equal rights in marriage; women should enjoy all rights completely equal to men; increase nurseries, daycare centers, kindergartens, sanitation facilities and health education; legislate for equal pay for equal work, and pay full wages during maternity leave; prohibit child labor; all children must receive compulsory free education, and launch a "little teacher" movement to eliminate illiteracy; set up higher education funds for women and children.

　　In some countries, if these rights have become the law of the country, we should urge their implementation. In areas where such rights are neither law nor custom, we should strive to have such rights explicitly stipulated.

　　On the road to peace, women all over the world are the greatest force. Through their representatives—the Women's International Democratic Federation—they launched the World Peace Congress held in Paris and Prague in April this year. We must once again explain to our enemies: that conference represents the wishes of more than 600 million people on earth, and it was attended by representatives of 561 national groups and 12 international groups. They are all striving for the same goal—world peace.

　　But this is just the beginning. Every country that participated in the World Peace Congress has had other gatherings since then to promote this precious idea. In the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai in China alone, more than two million people have marched and demonstrated to express their wishes to the world. Demonstrations are still going on all over the world. They continue to happen.

　　We must make those who are overwhelmed by the atmosphere of war understand this: when all the people of the world say they demand world peace, this does not mean that they are just demanding it passively, they will fight for peace.

　　In the past 32 years, at least 800 million people have been liberated and have established people's power. Such a great unity of peace advocates, coupled with the vast and strong people in the colonies of the Far East, the Middle East and Africa, shows how isolated the British and American warlords and financial groups—these war mongers—have become. We can defeat their desperate madness to destroy the world, we can completely stop them. We Asian women and our sisters in other countries, combined, can become the vanguard of world peace.

　　In order to promote this struggle, in order to make the world understand the position of the free women gathered in Beijing this time, I suggest that our conference issue two militant telegrams.

　　The first is to the women of Asia, let us say: Women of Asia, be encouraged! Double the courage, double the struggle! Your comrades are now meeting in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. We have seen your strength again. We are all fighting for world peace and the right to self-determination. No matter where you are, our hands and hearts are with you. If you are in the liberated area, we say: improve your country and your situation. If you are oppressed, we say: fight to organize yourselves!

　　The second telegram is to the women of the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Let us say: Women of the West: The number of free people is increasing day by day, which has frightened those who are trying to rule the world. These people want to rely on money and force to rule the world, like masters ruling slaves. They are the few financial groups in your country, the privileged in your country. Monopoly capitalists wear fascist clothes in your country, and they add imperialist coats when they go abroad. They will do anything, regardless of everything, in an attempt to maintain their vested interests. The Third World War has been included in their agenda. Asian women know that you already recognize this situation, and we hope that you will further know that we support you in your struggle against oppression and to defend human rights and world peace. Asian women salute you.

　　Women all over the world defend peace!

　　Women all over the world, unite and fight for the liberation of all mankind!

　　宋庆龄副主席给亚洲妇代会的贺信摘要
    【新华社北京十三日电】中央人民政府副主席中华全国民主妇联名誉主席宋庆龄致函祝贺亚洲妇女代表会议的召开。该贺信于十一日由史良在亚洲妇女代表会议上宣读。摘要如下：
    姊妹们，全亚洲的妇女们：我向你们的勇敢致敬，向你们伟大的成就致敬！我热烈地敬祝你们继续迈进，走向彻底的解放！
    当我们分析当前亚洲的情势，当我们重新检讨历史在我们国家和人民中所留下的标记的时候，我们看出妇女与全体人民有着共同的敌人。这些敌人，就是外来的帝国主义和它所造成的殖民主义以及国内所发生的封建主义，和它近代化的买办主义。
    帝国主义与封建主义使大多数人民坠入贫困。这些社会赘瘤，使人类生活得象低级的动物。吃的不能果腹，住的破烂不堪，穿的是褴褛碎片，更谈不到什么卫生。妇女与儿童总是首先遭遇到这些灾难。不论在工作时或失业时，他们都受到最厉害的剥削。他们即使艰苦地工作，至多也只能得到最低微的工资。在大多数国家内，妇女都受不到教育，而在有学校的地方，也只有少数特殊阶级，方才能够享受。
    妇女在社会上及政治上都被压到奴隶的地位，充其量也不过是二等公民。妇女被束缚只作家庭事务，妇女被看作卑劣而不配学习或工作。这是典型的封建主义与法西斯主义。
    我们很久就了解到，亚洲妇女在争取从这一悲惨境遇里解放出来的斗争中，绝对得不到帝国主义者的同情。只要看看帝国主义国家在国内如何对待妇女，这点就可以得到证明了。在富有的男子们的眼里，妇女不过是装饰品。
    在第二次世界大战时，美国的妇女，对于解放自己，曾经得到进展，由于军事需要，工业大量膨胀，需要雇用几百万当时雇不到的熟练工人。这样才使妇女有参加各种工业工作的机会。美国妇女的前途，看来好象是好转了。但到胜利在望时，美国国内便发生了迫使妇女离开工厂回到厨房里去的普遍活动。绝大多数的工会也和反动派勾结起来参加这一活动。美国惯用的高压式宣传喊着：“太太们，多谢你们的帮忙，你们还是回去带小孩子吧。”或者说：“你们的男人已经从战场回来，需要你们到家庭去，你们不应该穿上肮脏的工人服装去迎接他，因为在他想象中，你是穿得花枝招展的呢！”
    妇女在其他各处也受到同样的对待。例如英国女教员们的所得，总比男子低百分之十至十五。
    所以当我们知道在所有的殖民地国家中，产儿与孕妇的福利都根本没有，那是不足为奇的。工厂、农场、工场以及其他经济力量的主人，同时也就是法院的主人。因此，即使在法律规定以后，当他们违法时，他们也显然决不会受到制裁。帝国主义者与他们在各国的走狗甚至认为生育是犯罪的。在妇女怀孕时即将她们解雇，以避免支付孕妇的休养金。他们也可以干脆阻止孕妇们请假，并拒绝支付法律所规定的休养金。
    我们对于这些罪恶必须彻底予以消灭。这一切是可以成功的，因为这是历史的必然性，因为亚洲人民虽然有敌人，但他们也有朋友。首要的朋友是国家的真正独立，我们用“真正”二字，因为远东有许多虚伪的独立，这些国家虽然大声地叫喊着要使全世界听到他们是“自由”的，但实际上这只是仍然管制他们的帝国主义者的叫嚣。
    至于独立的国家则截然不同。它是建筑在人民幸福之上，并且在人民的全力的支持下。它是人民民主成长的沃土。
    我们中华人民共和国便是实例之一。我们的时机终究已经到来。新民主主义的伟大力量团结了各民主阶级各民主党派。它们将努力奋斗建设一个真正独立的民主的中国。同时，妇女亦将得到解放，在一切方面都和男子享有平等的权利。
    这已写在我们的根本法律，即人民政治协商会议共同纲领之中。它的第六条规定了：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利，实行男女婚姻自由。”
    在通过这根本法的人民政治协商会议的代表之中，百分之十是妇女。她们可以参与根本政策的形成和经济、教育、文化的实际活动。她们在政治上也是积极的，例如协同完成奠定新民主主义基础的土地改革，就是其中的一项。不仅如此，在她们为人民服务的时候，她们的儿童是受到照顾的。看！从五月上海解放后，托儿所增加了三倍。看！各种学校不断地增加，所有解放区内的学生人数也都大量激增。
    殖民地所能寻求的第二友人，便是世界无产阶级运动，这就是他们以苏联为首的国际友人，在这里，任何人民都可得到尊重与基于平等和互敬的待遇。在这里，所有少数民族和进步的斗士以及被压迫者，都可得同情与援助。在这里，我们看到妇女发展的先例以及她们在和平建国中的功绩。
    这两个友人——国家独立与世界无产阶级运动——对于全世界的人民和妇女都是无可估价的帮助。他们将妇女平等写入法律。
    事实胜于雄辩。社会主义制度本身就是证明。它不会牺牲人民的利益而只会给予人民以种种照顾，使他们享受更多的食物、更低廉的物价，并使他们的前途有充分发展的保障。
    对远东人民，这一切都只意味着一件事，这就是我们必须向苏联学习。我们妇女在促进文化时，也应当向苏联妇女们学习。同时亚洲新建立的民主国家，也应能作为未解放的国家和妇女们的榜样，将所有的经验贡献给他们，使他们能在斗争中得到必然的胜利。
    努力去奋斗吧！亚洲的妇女们曾经在军队里与男人们并肩作战，争取民族的独立，反抗殖民地政策和帝国主义，反抗他们本国的封建主义和买办主义。他们曾经面对着死亡和集中营的苦刑，遭遇过一切无法想象的惨死。亚洲妇女曾参加并领导罢工和示威，曾在武装起义中以无比的英勇献出她们的生命。中国、印度、越南、朝鲜、印尼和其他各国英勇的女性，是任何地方的妇女都可以引以为荣的。
    让全亚洲的妇女团结起来进行这斗争吧！除了实现国家独立与自由这两项亚洲的基本要求以外，让我们为下列权利而斗争：妇女婚姻应有平等权利；妇女享有与男子完全平等的全部权利；增加托儿所、保育院、幼稚园、卫生设备与卫生教育；立法规定同工同酬，分娩假期照付全部工资；禁用童工；所有儿童必须受强迫免费教育，并展开“小先生”运动，以扫除文盲；设置妇女及儿童高等教育基金。
    在有些国家内如果这些权利已成为该国法律，我们应该督促其实施。在这种权利还既非法律，也非习惯的区域，我们应努力奋斗使这种权利得到明文规定。
    在走向和平的道路上，全世界的妇女是最伟大的力量。她们经由她们的代表——国际民主妇联，发起了今年四月在巴黎及布拉格召开的世界和平大会。我们必须再次向我们的敌人说明：那个大会代表地球上六万万以上人民的愿望，它有五百六十一个全国性团体与十二个国际团体的代表参加。他们都是为了争取同一目的——世界和平。
    但这只是开始。每一个参加过世界和平大会的国家从那时起都曾有过其他的集会，来发扬这个宝贵的思想。单在中国的北京及上海两个城市，就有二百万以上的人民游行示威，向全世界表示他们的愿望。示威还在全世界各处进行。它们仍继续发生。
    我们必须使那些被战争气氛冲昏了头脑的人弄清楚这一点：当全世界全体人民说他们要求世界和平的时候，这不是说他们只是消极地要求，他们将为争取和平而斗争。
    在过去三十二年中，至少有八万万人民，已得到解放，并且建立了人民的政权。和平拥护者这样伟大的团结，加上远东、中东及非洲殖民地中广大坚强的人民，说明英美军阀和财阀——这些战争贩子们已经如何孤立。我们可以打倒他们企图毁灭世界的绝望疯狂，我们可以完全制止他们。我们亚洲妇女和其他国家的姊妹们结合起来，可以成为世界和平的先锋。
    为着推进这种斗争，为了使全世界都明了这次在北京集合的自由妇女的立场，我建议我们的会议发出两个战斗性的通电。
    第一个是给亚洲妇女的，让我们说：亚洲的妇女们，鼓舞起来！加倍的勇敢，加倍的斗争！你们的同志们现正在中华人民共和国首都北京开会。我们又一次地看到了你们的力量。我们都在为全世界的和平与自决权而斗争。不论你们在何处，我们的手和心都向着你们。如果你们在已解放的区域内，我们说：改善你们国家和你们所处的地位。如果你们是被压迫者，我们说：为组织自己而斗争！
    第二个通电是给美英和其他西方国家的妇女的。让我们说：西方的妇女们：自由人民的人数已日渐增多，这吓坏了那些企图统治世界的人们。这些人要倚仗金钱和武力来统治世界，象主人统治奴隶一样。他们就是你们国家里的少数财阀，也就是你们国家里的特权分子。独占资本家在你们国家内穿着法西斯的衣服，他们跑到国外还加上帝国主义的外套。他们不择手段，不顾一切，企图保持他们的既得利益。第三次大战已被列入他们的日程中了。亚洲妇女知道你们已经认识这种情形，我们希望你们进一步地知道，在你们反抗压迫和保卫人权与世界和平的斗争中，我们是支持着你们的。亚洲妇女向你们致敬。
    全世界的妇女保卫和平！
    全世界的妇女，团结斗争，争取全人类的解放！
