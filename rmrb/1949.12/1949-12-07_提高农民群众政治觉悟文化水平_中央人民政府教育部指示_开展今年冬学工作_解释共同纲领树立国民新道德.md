　　Raising the Political Consciousness and Cultural Level of the Peasant Masses
  　Instructions from the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government to
    Launch This Year's Winter Study Campaign
    Explaining the Common Program and Establishing New National Morality
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 6th] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government yesterday issued instructions on launching this year's winter study campaign, the full text of which is as follows:

    Instructions from the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on Launching This Year's Winter Study Campaign.

    (1) The experience of the Liberated Areas of the Chinese People over the past ten years has proven that the rural winter study movement is one of the powerful weapons for uniting and educating the broad masses of peasants. The winter studies in the Liberated Areas not only carried out rural literacy education, but also, in combination with the specific work of the People's Government at that time, greatly helped to raise the political consciousness and cultural level of the peasant masses, thereby effectively serving the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the more than three-year People's Liberation War, and the land reform movement. This educational method, which meets the needs of the broad masses and is closely integrated with practical work, should be universally promoted in rural areas across the country in the future.

    (2) Winter study education includes both political and cultural aspects. Since this year is the first year of the founding of the People's Republic of China, since the People's Liberation War has basically been won but has not yet ended, and economic construction needs to be developed urgently but there are still great difficulties, the basic content of political education in this year's winter studies should be to publicize to the peasants the great significance of the birth of the People's Republic of China, explain the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, explain the current military, political, and economic situation in China and the tasks of the working people, and discuss ways to restore and develop local agricultural production and overcome various difficulties in production. In conducting this political education, it should be linked to the local situation and the experience of mass struggle, explaining in a simple and understandable way how our people's country was created with difficulty, how the people's revolution won victory, how the remnants of the reactionaries and imperialists are still resisting and carrying out sabotage activities, how the revolutionary war must be carried through to the end, why financial and economic difficulties occur in the war and how to overcome these difficulties, how the construction of New Democracy should be carried out, what the basic principles and basic policies of the Common Program are, how the people's democratic dictatorship based on the leadership of the proletariat and the worker-peasant alliance and the people's democratic united front should be established and consolidated, why it is necessary to implement "leaning to one side," why it is necessary to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and support the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and why it is necessary to regard loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and protecting public property as the new morality of the people's country, so that the people of the whole country truly realize that they are the masters and creators of China, and consciously strive for the construction of New China. Political education in winter studies should be carried out in coordination with education on local central work. Discussing how to restore and develop agricultural production in 1950 and how to overcome various difficulties in production should be one of the important contents of winter studies. In disaster areas, winter studies should pay attention to education on production and disaster relief, and when necessary, winter studies can also serve the work of production and disaster relief, but in areas with severe disasters, do not force winter studies to be held.

    (3) The content of winter study cultural education should focus on literacy. When possible, appropriate health knowledge education and preparations for Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities can also be added. In order to expand the educational effect of winter studies, permanent organizations such as literacy groups and reading groups should be established in a planned way in winter studies, and winter studies with better conditions should be selected and prepared to be transformed into regular peasant half-day schools, peasant night schools, or primary schools after the end of winter studies.

    (4) The Common Program should be the main political teaching material for winter studies. The education departments of each province and municipality or the education offices of administrative offices should immediately designate special personnel to compile and print popular teaching outlines based on the content of the Common Program, combined with the specific local conditions and the immediate concerns of the masses, and distribute them to the counties for application. Literacy textbooks can be either existing ones or newly compiled, which can be determined by each province and municipality.

    (5) Whether winter studies can be done well depends on the teachers. The people's governments of each province and municipality should immediately organize a group of teachers in a planned way to give them short-term training with the Common Program as the main content. Various government agencies stationed in rural areas or neighboring towns should also draw cadres as much as possible to serve as winter study teachers. After the school holidays, all primary and secondary school teachers have the responsibility to participate in winter study work as much as possible. In addition, people with higher cultural levels and enthusiasm for teaching in the village can also be selected and hired as cultural teachers, and short-term training should also be given to them in advance. Winter study teachers with excellent results should be commended and rewarded.

    (6) In order to lead the winter study work, the local governments should organize winter study movement committees at all levels, which should be presided over by responsible government personnel in person, absorb the responsible persons of people's organizations, youth organizations, and the educational circles to participate, and must have special personnel to be regularly responsible for checking the progress of the winter study work, promoting good experiences in a timely manner, solving difficulties, and correcting shortcomings.

    (7) In the leadership of winter study work, it is necessary to correctly implement the mass line of relying on the masses to run schools, enlighten the masses to consciously and voluntarily enroll in school according to the specific local conditions and mass requirements, and strictly prevent the error of coercion and command. In the teaching of winter studies, the teaching principle of unity of theory and practice should be observed, adapting to the situation and needs of the masses' lives. The methods of winter studies should be flexible, and the organizational forms should not be forced to be uniform. According to reports from various places, some of this year's winter studies have already begun, some are being arranged, and some have not yet been arranged. It is hoped that after receiving these instructions, those provinces and municipalities that have not yet arranged should quickly arrange them accordingly, and those that have been arranged must also check and strengthen this work according to the principles of the instructions, and report the arrangement and progress to the Ministry.

　　提高农民群众政治觉悟文化水平
  　中央人民政府教育部指示
    开展今年冬学工作
    解释共同纲领树立国民新道德
    【新华社北京六日电】中央人民政府教育部昨发出关于开展今年冬学工作的指示，全文如下：
    中央人民政府教育部关于开展今年冬学工作的指示。
    （一）中国人民解放区十余年来的经验证明，农村冬学运动是团结教育广大农民的有力武器之一。解放区的冬学不但进行了农村识字教育，而且与人民政府当时当地的具体工作相结合，曾经大大地帮助了提高农民群众的政治觉悟和文化水平，从而有效地服务于八年的抗日战争，三年多的人民解放战争，和土地改革运动。这种适应广大群众需要的与实际工作密切结合着的教育方式，今后应当在全国农村中普遍推行。
    （二）冬学教育包括政治的和文化的两个方面。由于今年是中华人民共和国成立的一年，由于人民解放战争已经基本上胜利，但尚未结束，经济建设亟待开展，但困难还很大，所以今年冬学的政治教育的基本内容，应当是向农民宣传中华人民共和国诞生的伟大意义，解释人民政协的共同纲领，解释目前中国的军事政治经济情势和劳动人民的任务，讨论恢复和发展本地农业生产和克服生产中各种困难的办法。在进行这种政治教育的时候，应当联系到当地的情况和群众斗争的经验，深入浅出地说明我们的人民国家是如何艰难缔造的，人民革命是如何赢得胜利的，反动派残余和帝国主义者如何还在抵抗和进行破坏活动，如何必须把革命战争进行到底，为何在战争中发生财政经济的困难和如何克服这种困难，新民主主义的建设应当如何进行，共同纲领的基本原则和基本政策是什么，以无产阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线应当如何树立与巩固，为何必须实行“一面倒”，必须加强中苏友谊和拥护以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线，为何必须把爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财产，作为人民国家的新道德，使全国人民真正意识到自己是中国的主人和创造者，自觉地为新中国的建设而奋斗。冬学中的政治教育应当配合关于当地中心工作的教育来进行。讨论一九五○年如何恢复和发展农业生产，如何克服生产中的各种困难，应当成为冬学的重要内容之一。在灾区，冬学应注意生产救灾的教育，必要时并可使冬学服务于生产救灾的工作，但在灾情严重地区，则不要勉强办冬学。
    （三）冬学文化教育的内容应当以识字为主。可能时还可以加入适当的卫生常识教育和春节文艺娱乐活动的准备。为了扩大冬学的教育的效果，应当在冬学中有计划地建立识字组读报组等类经常的组织，并选择条件较好的冬学有准备地在冬学结束以后转变为经常的农民半日学校，农民夜校或小学。
    （四）冬学政治教材以共同纲领为主。各省教育厅市教育局或行政公署教育处应即指定专人，根据共同纲领内容，结合当地具体情况与群众切身问题，编印通俗的教学提纲，发给各县应用。识字课本或用现成的，或新编，可由各省市自行酌定。
    （五）冬学能否办好，决定的因素之一在于师资。各省市政府应即有计划地组织一批教师，以共同纲领为主要内容给以短期训练。驻在农村或邻近城镇的各种政府机关，亦应尽可能抽调干部担任冬学教师。学校放假后，一切中小学教师都有尽可能参加冬学工作的责任。此外，还可选聘村中文化水平较高并热心教学的人担任文化教师，事前亦应给以短期训练。对成绩优良的冬学教员应予以表扬奖励。
    （六）为了领导冬学工作，各地政府应组织各级的冬学运动委员会，由政府负责人员亲自主持，吸收人民团体、青年团体和教育界的负责人参加，并须有专人经常负责，检查冬学工作的进行状况，及时推广好的经验，解决困难，纠正缺点。
    （七）在冬学工作的领导中，必须正确地执行依靠群众办学的群众路线，根据当地具体情况与群众要求，启发群众自觉自愿地入学，严格防止强迫命令的错误。在冬学的教学中应当遵守理论与实际一致的教学原则，适应群众生活的情况和需要。冬学的方式务求灵活，组织形式不要强求一律。根据各地报告，今年的冬学，有的已经开始，有的正在布置，有的还未布置。望各省市于接到此指示后，未布置者应赶速照此布置，已布置者亦须根据指示的原则，检查和加强这一工作，并将布置和进行情形报告本部。
