Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th: According to TASS, Moscow: Pravda published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "The Struggle Against War and to Defend Peace is the Cause of the People of All Countries in the World," commenting on the resolution of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau on defending peace and fighting war-mongers, stating: "The entire course of events over the past two years has fully and completely confirmed the correctness of the assessment of the international situation made at the first meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau held in September 1947. During these two years, the struggle between the two opposing and hostile camps on the international stage has become more acute. American and British imperialists are frantically preparing for new bloody killings, shamelessly clamoring for world hegemony and so-called 'American world domination.' On the other hand, a powerful peace movement with a population of 600 million has spread throughout the world, attracting more and more new fighters against the threat of war into its ranks. The forces of peace and democracy are limitless. They are growing day by day."

Pravda then emphasized that the huge growth in the strength of the democratic camp and the increasing weakening of the anti-democratic imperialist camp should not give true fighters for peace any sense of complacency or self-satisfaction. The Information Bureau's document specifically emphasizes that it would be wrong and harmful to underestimate the danger of a new war being prepared by the imperialist countries headed by the United States and Britain. Only with extreme vigilance and a firm determination to exert all efforts and use all means to actively fight for peace can the people of all countries thwart the sinister plots of the instigators of a new war.

Pravda also stated: "Faced with the growing danger of a new war, a great historical mission falls on the shoulders of the Communist and Workers' Parties. The Information Bureau's document provides a fighting program of action for the Communist Parties and democratic organizations of all countries, first and foremost to consolidate and expand the peace movement organizationally, making it a mass movement throughout the world. In capitalist countries, the struggle for national independence and the struggle for peace must be combined into one, and the anti-national and treasonous policies pursued by the bourgeois governments (which have become direct subordinates of aggressive American imperialism) must be exposed. The responsibility of the Communist and Workers' Parties in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is to expose the imperialist warmongers, while at the same time fully strengthening the camp of peace and socialism. The great Soviet Union leads the growing and strengthening peace front and is the bulwark and banner of world peace. The epoch-making victories won by the Soviet Union under the leadership of the great Stalin inspire the working people everywhere and strengthen the camp of fighters for peace, democracy, and socialism."

　　各国人民提高警惕保卫和平
  　战贩阴谋必遭挫败
    真理报著文评论情报局决议
    【新华社北京五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于三日以“反对战争、保卫和平的斗争是全世界一切国家人民的事业”为题发表社论，评论共产党与工人党情报局关于保卫和平与对战争贩子进行斗争的决议称：过去两年来事件发展的全部进程，业已完全和充分地证实了在一九四七年九月举行的共产党与工人党情报局第一次会议对国际形势估计的正确性。在这两年中，国际舞台上两个针锋相对的敌对阵营之间的斗争，业已变得更加尖锐化，美英帝国主义者正在疯狂地准备着新的血腥杀戮，他们厚颜无耻地叫嚣着什么称霸世界、什么“美国的世界统治”的要求。而另一方面，拥有六亿人民之众的强大的和平运动，已遍及世界各地，并把愈来愈多的反对战争威胁的新斗士吸引到它的行列中来，和平与民主的力量是无限的。它们正一天天地在增长着。
    真理报继而强调指出，民主阵营力量的巨大增长，和反民主的帝国主义阵营的愈益削弱，绝不应使争取和平的真正斗士有任何自满自足的感觉。情报局的文件特别着重指出这种情形，即过低估计以美国及英国为首的帝国主义国家正在准备的新战争之危险，将是错误而且有害的。各国人民只有以极端敏锐的警惕以及竭尽一切努力和用尽一切方法为和平而积极斗争的坚定决心，才能挫败新战争挑拨者罪恶的阴谋。
    真理报又称：面对着日益增长的新战争危险，伟大的历史使命落在共产党与工人党的肩上。情报局的文件给各国共产党和民主的组织提供了一个战斗的行动纲领，首先要在组织上巩固并扩大和平运动，使它成为全世界的群众运动。在资本主义国家中，争取国家独立的斗争和争取和平的斗争必须合而为一，必须揭露资产阶级政府（它已成为直接隶属于侵略性的美国帝国主义的下属）所奉行的反民族的卖国政策。苏联与人民民主国家共产党与工人党的责任，是要揭发帝国主义战争贩子，同时又须充分加强和平与社会主义的阵营。伟大的苏联领导着日益成长与壮大的和平阵线，并且是世界和平的堡垒与旗手。苏联在伟大的斯大林领导之下所获得的划时代的胜利，鼓舞着各地的劳动人民，并加强争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗士之阵营。
