Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 28th: The French Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, published on the 22nd, under the title "Chinese Central People's Government Protests French Aircraft Interference," the full text of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the 20th protesting the intrusion of French aircraft into our airspace. According to the paper's report on the 23rd: Workers at the Toulon Arsenal and the submarine repair plant in France left work fifteen minutes early on the 22nd to express their opposition to the French imperialists' heinous war in Vietnam. On the same day, the paper reported that personnel on the cargo ship "Calais," which returned to Marseille from Saigon on the 21st, revealed that several months ago, when the ship sailed from France fully loaded with expeditionary troops to Saigon, three French soldiers jumped into the sea near the Suez Canal because they were unwilling to fight in Vietnam. When the ship approached Singapore, another four new recruits attempted to jump into the sea to refuse to fight against the Vietnamese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: TASS, Paris: The mass movement of French democrats, peace advocates, progressive youth, and the people of the whole country against the continuation of the colonial war in Vietnam is being carried out on a broad scale in various places. On the 26th of this month, Professor Levy (of the Progressive Republican Union), a member of parliament, presented to the French President a letter signed by many members of the French public and political figures, pointing out that the war to slaughter the Vietnamese people must be stopped immediately. The Executive Bureau of the French Veterans' Federation passed a resolution demanding that the government immediately stop the war in Vietnam. The Paris 13th District Branch of the French Republican Youth League sent a letter to the employees of the Banallé and Deles factories, urging them not to produce military supplies designated for the war in Vietnam.

The French Women's Union is actively promoting a broad movement against the war in Vietnam and has decided to designate January 25, 1950, as a National Mother's Day to protest the war in Vietnam. A mass protest rally will be held at the Winter Sports Stadium on that day.
