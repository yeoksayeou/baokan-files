　　Beijing Suburbs:
  　Active Elements Approved to Join the Party
  　Using Self-Nomination, Public Discussion, and Party Committee Approval Method
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Suburban Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a joint meeting of the heads of the Organization Departments of the district committees of the suburbs on the 6th to discuss Party building work in the land reform. At the beginning of the meeting, the heads of the Organization Departments of the district committees reported on the Party building situation. In the twenty villages of Bagou, Kandan, Xiaohongmen, Juzi Fang, and Liulangzhuang, where land reform has been completed or is underway, more than 160 activists who emerged in the land reform work have been approved to join the Party, and village branches have been established, forming a leading force in the land reform; and laying a solid foundation for future rural work. Su Min, the Minister of the Organization Department of the Suburban Committee, based on the experience gained by the districts in this stage of Party building work, pointed out: Self-nomination, public discussion, and Party committee approval have proven to be a very good way to openly build the Party and closely connect the Party with the masses. However, public discussion is for the masses to offer opinions as one of the bases for the Party committee's approval, not equivalent to approval by the masses. Regarding the integration of Party building and land reform work, it is necessary to use various activities and meetings of land reform work to carry out Party education, starting from the existing class consciousness and political awareness level of the masses, enlightening their awareness, and promoting their conscious and voluntary participation in the organization. As for the composition of rural party members, it should be dominated by poor and hired peasant components, and some middle peasant components can also be absorbed. Admission procedures, rituals, etc., must be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution.

　　京市郊区土改中
  　积极分子被批准入党
  　采用自报公议党委批准方法
    【北京讯】中共北京市郊区工作委员会于六日召开郊区各区委组织部部长联席会议，讨论土地改革中的建党工作。会议首由各区区委组织部部长报告建党情况，在业已完成与正在进行土地改革的巴沟、看丹、小红门、驹子房、六郎庄等二十个村，已有在土地改革工作中涌现的积极分子一百六十余人被批准入党，建立了村支部，形成了土地改革中的领导力量；并为今后的农村工作打下强固的基础。郊委组织部长苏民根据各区在这一阶段建党工作中所获经验，指出：自报公议，党委批准，已证明是公开建党，密切党与群众关系的很好方式。但公议是由群众提意见，作为党委批准根据之一，非即群众批准。关于建党和土地改革工作结合问题，应当利用土地改革工作的各项活动和会议，进行党的教育，从群众现有阶级觉悟和政治觉悟水平出发，启发其觉悟，促其自觉自愿的加入组织。至于农村党员的成份，应以贫雇农成分为主，并可吸收部分中农成分。入党手续、仪式等，均须依照党章规定办理。
