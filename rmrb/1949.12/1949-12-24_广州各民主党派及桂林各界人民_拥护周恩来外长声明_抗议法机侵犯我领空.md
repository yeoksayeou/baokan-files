　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd: Guangzhou's democratic parties have expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the French aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace. Chen Rutang of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang said: The French government's blatant act of interfering in our people's sacred liberation war must bear all serious consequences. Li Zhangda of the China Democratic League said: The French government's action is clearly protecting the White bandits. The fact that this incident occurred on the border of South China makes us, the people of South China, even more indignant. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Qin Yuanbang of the Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association said: The intrusion of French aircraft into our airspace is inseparable from the fact that the French authorities in Vietnam are harboring remnants of the White bandits. In addition to supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, I must reiterate Foreign Minister Zhou's other statement on November 29 regarding the fleeing of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs to foreign countries such as Vietnam. The Chinese people have the right to question the French imperialists allowing the remnants of the White bandits to escape into Vietnam. Chen Qiyou of the China Zhi Gong Party pointed out: Even a three-year-old child can see that the French government's actions are colluding with the Chiang-Bai remnants. This is clearly a challenge to the Chinese people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 23rd: People from all walks of life in Guilin firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the French aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace. The Guilin Federation of Trade Unions issued a written statement saying: "We express our firm protest against the French imperialists' hostile act of openly sending aircraft to intrude into our airspace twice. Especially since this act occurred when our People's Liberation Army was encircling and annihilating the remnants of the bandits attempting to flee into Vietnam, it further illustrates that the French imperialists intentionally sheltered the White bandits." The Guilin Women's Federation Preparatory Committee stated: "The French imperialists' hostile act of sending aircraft to intrude into our airspace twice, protecting the ferocious and disregarding the Chinese people, fully exposes the hideous faces of the imperialists. We firmly support the solemn statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou." The Guilin Student Federation Preparatory Committee denounced the French government's action as a blatant act of aggression by imperialism. Guangxi Daily published a short commentary on the 21st saying: The Li-Bai bandit gang ruled Guangxi for more than 20 years, committing heinous crimes. The people of Guangxi hate them to the core and vow to arrest the White bandits and bring them to justice. The French imperialists are actually colluding with the White bandits, openly sending aircraft to intrude into our country's airspace twice, vainly attempting to cover the remnants of the White bandits as they retreat into Vietnam in order to regroup and bring disaster to the people of Guangxi. This cannot but arouse the anger of all the people of Guangxi. The newspaper called on the people of Guangxi to closely watch the French imperialists' hostile act of sheltering the remnants of the White bandits.

　　广州各民主党派及桂林各界人民
    拥护周恩来外长声明
    抗议法机侵犯我领空
    【新华社广州二十三日电】广州各民主党派表示坚决拥护周恩来外长对法国飞机侵犯我国领空事发表的声明。国民党革命委员会陈汝棠说：法国政府这种明目张胆干涉我国人民的神圣解放战争的行为，必须负担一切严重的后果。中国民主同盟李章达说：法国政府这种行为，分明是袒护白匪，此事发生在华南国境线上，更使我们华南人民激愤。我们坚决拥护周外长的声明。国民党民主促进会秦元邦说：法机侵我领空与越南法国当局收留白匪残部两事是不可分的。我除了拥护周外长此次声明之外，还得重提十一月二十九日周外长就国民党反动匪帮逃往国外越南等地的另一声明。对于法帝国主义让白匪残余逃匿越南一事，我们中国人民有权利过问。中国致公党陈其尤指出：法政府这种行径，三岁小孩子都看出他是和蒋白残匪勾结，这分明是在向中国人民挑战。
    【新华社桂林二十三日电】桂林市各界人民坚决拥护周恩来外长对法国飞机侵入我领空所发表的声明。桂林职工联合会发表书面声明说：“我们对法国帝国主义两次公然派机侵入我领空的敌意行为，表示坚决抗议。尤其这行为发生在我解放大军正围歼企图逃入越境残匪的时候，更说明了法帝国主义有意庇护白匪。”桂林妇联筹委会声明说：“法帝国主义两次派飞机侵入我领空，这种庇护凶狂蔑视中国人民的敌意行为，十足暴露了帝国主义的狰狞面目，我们坚决拥护周外长提出的严正声明”。桂林学联筹委会指斥法国政府这种行为是帝国主义明目张胆的侵略行为。广西日报二十一日发表短评说：李白匪帮统治广西二十多年，罪恶滔天。广西人民莫不切齿痛恨，誓必缉拿白匪归案法办。法帝国主义竟与白匪互相勾结，公然两次派飞机侵入我国领空，妄想掩护白匪残部退入越南以重振旗鼓来祸害我广西人民，这不能不引起全广西人民的愤怒。该报号召广西人民密切注视法帝国主义这一庇护白匪残部的敌意行为。
