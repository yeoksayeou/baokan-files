Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 19th: The *Northeast Daily* published an editorial here on the 7th entitled "Promote the Experience of the Shenyang People's Representative Conference," saying: The Second Shenyang People's Representative Conference was a great success. In two and a half days, it resolved two major urgent problems: one was the adoption of three draft resolutions on handling labor-capital relations, and the other was the resolution of the winter social relief issue. Finally, it also offered kind criticism and constructive suggestions for the government's work.

The editorial said: Based on the experience of various localities, to fully utilize the People's Representative Conference, this basic form of political power organization, it is necessary to grasp three key links. The first is to prepare well, the second is to lead the conference well, and the third is to follow through and transform the resolutions into practical actions by the broad masses. The Second Shenyang People's Representative Conference followed these three links.

Regarding how to prepare, the editorial pointed out: Link the preparation for the representative conference with the government's daily work, unify them, widely solicit opinions from the masses, identify the main problems, and fully deliberate among people from all walks of life so that the issues to be discussed at the conference approach maturity. This ensures that the conference truly solves problems. The Second Shenyang People's Representative Conference prepared in this way. To solve the issue of labor-capital relations, draft resolutions were proposed in mid-September and handed over to both labor and capital for full discussion. This ensured that the government's current work was the preparation for the representative conference, and the issues to be resolved by the representative conference were also the issues that the government needed to resolve, rather than a separate set. To lead the conference well, the conference content must be concise and clear, seeking only to solve one or two important issues that the masses urgently need to resolve, avoiding being greedy and all-encompassing; at the same time, the conference must earnestly implement the spirit of the People's Democratic United Front, widely promote democracy, and different opinions should be fully discussed to achieve consensus under the principle of unity. During the discussion of labor-capital relations at the Second Shenyang People's Representative Conference, not only did both labor and capital put forward their own opinions, but representatives from other sectors, such as the military, education, culture, women, and youth, also spoke out, supporting the correct opinions and criticizing the incorrect opinions, ultimately leading to the unanimous adoption of the three draft resolutions and educating all the representatives and attendees. This conference proved that as long as the spirit of the People's Democratic United Front is correctly grasped and repeated discussions are held, satisfactory results can be achieved.

The editorial finally emphasized: Based on the Shenyang experience, future People's Representative Conferences must allocate considerable time for representatives to speak freely and offer criticisms and suggestions on the government's work, and this practice should be established as a system. The benefit of this system is, first, that it can widely hear the opinions of people from all walks of life regarding the government's policies, preventing representatives who are not directly related to the central issues under discussion from being unable to raise their other opinions and demands, which can improve the representatives' enthusiasm. Secondly, it can be used to rectify the work style of government staff, overcome various bureaucratic phenomena that separate them from the masses, and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the government and the people.

　　充分运用人民代表会议
    东北日报评沈阳人民代表会议经验
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】此间东北日报于七日以“推广沈阳市人民代表会的经验”为题发表社论说：沈阳第二次人民代表会议，开得很好，用了两天半的时间，解决了当前最迫切的两个大问题，一个是通过了处理劳资关系问题的三个草案，一个是解决了冬季社会救济问题，最后并对政府工作进行了善意的批评和积极性建议。
    社论说：根据各地的经验，要充分运用人民代表会议这种政权组织的基本形式，必须抓住三个环节，第一环是准备好，第二环是把会议领导好，第三环是贯澈下去，把决议变成广大群众的实际行动。沈阳市第二次人民代表会议就是遵循这三个环节进行的。
    关于如何进行准备问题，社论指出：把代表会议的准备与政府日常工作联系起来，统一起来，广泛听取群众意见，找出主要问题，在各界人民中进行充分酝酿，使会议中所要讨论的问题接近成熟的程度。这样就保证会议真正解决问题。沈阳第二次人民代表会议就是这样进行准备工作的，为了解决劳资关系问题，九月中旬提出草案，交予劳资双方充分讨论。这就使得政府当前的工作就是代表会议的准备工作，代表会议所要解决的问题，也就是政府需要解决的问题，而不是另外一套。会议要领导好，必须使会议内容简要明确，只求解决一两个群众所迫切需要解决的重要问题，不要贪多，不要包罗万象；同时会议要认真贯彻人民民主统一战线精神，广泛发扬民主，不同意见应展开充分讨论，以求在团结的原则下达到一致。沈阳第二次人民代表会议在讨论劳资关系问题时，不仅劳资双方提出了自己的意见，而其他各界，如军队、文教、妇女、青年等的代表，也都纷纷发言，支持了正确的意见，批评了不正确的意见，最后使得三个草案一致通过，也教育了全体代表和一切列席会议的人员。这次会议证明，只要正确掌握人民民主统一战线的精神，经过反复讨论，就能达到圆满结果。
    社论最后强调指出：根据沈阳经验，今后每次人民代表会议，必须用相当时间让代表们自由发言和对政府工作提出批评和建议，应当把这种做法当成一种制度。这种制度的好处，首先可以广泛听各界人民对于政府施政情况的各方面的意见，不致因讨论中心问题而使没有直接关系的代表得不到机会提出自己的另外意见和要求，这就可以提高代表的积极性。其次是可以用来整顿政府工作人员的作风，克服各种脱离群众的官僚主义现象，密切政府与人民的血肉联系。
