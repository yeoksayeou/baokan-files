　　The Two Tyrants of Yinghaizhuang
    Lin Mo
    Yinghaizhuang is located in the 14th District of the southern suburbs of Beijing. Before liberation, people from the surrounding villages were afraid to go to this village. Why? Simply because Yinghaizhuang was home to the tyrannical landlords, the brothers Jia Ruxin and Jia Rufen. They were overbearing, violent, murderous, and they hung and beat the people, raped women, and committed all kinds of evil. The people in the surrounding area feared them like tigers.

    These two tyrants' uncle had been a county magistrate, and their father had been a secretary in the county government. Their family made their fortune by holding official positions. They bought more than 300 mu of land in Yinghaizhuang, and later lived by collecting rent and exploiting the people. During the Japanese occupation, Jia Ruxin served as a squad leader in the Japanese military police and also as the head of the Daixing County guard. After the Japanese surrender, Jia Rufen served as the head of the puppet township. For more than a decade, they hung and beat hundreds of people, raped dozens of women, and personally murdered fourteen people.

    After the liberation of Beijing, the people of Yinghaizhuang filed complaints with the People's Government about the crimes of these two tyrants. Recently, under the leadership of the land reform work team, the people of Yinghaizhuang and more than a dozen surrounding villages jointly held an accusation meeting of more than a thousand people on November 14. Many oppressed people recounted their past grievances, which they had nowhere to voice, and exposed the bloody crimes of the tyrants Jia Ruxin and Jia Rufen.

    Li Dashuo's mother from Sanhaitang Village has been begging everywhere for seven or eight years since her only son was assassinated by Jia Ruxin. She often runs to the fields alone, crying and looking for her son, her eyes almost blind from crying. When her son was murdered by Jia Ruxin, she heard that there was a corpse west of Yinghaizhuang Village. She thought of going there to see, but she was afraid of being persecuted by the Jia family again, so the corpse was left there to be torn to pieces by dogs. Li Dashuo was a small vendor. In 1941, he took money and a bag of corn from his home to Beijing to purchase goods. On the way, he encountered a patrol team led by Jia Ruxin. Jia Ruxin used the excuse that Dashuo did not have a pass, robbed him of his goods, and dragged him out and shot him at night. In the same year, Sun Zhanxiang from the same village and Zhang Si from Sihezhuang were also killed by Jia Ruxin. In addition, Wang Xipeng had one of his legs broken.

    That year, when Yinghaizhuang was building the village office, it sent carts to pull bricks. Jia Ruxin himself shot and killed two mules, but he levied a fine in the village to compensate for them. Sun Zhanxiang was hung and beaten for failing to pay the fine. Sun Zhanxiang was so angry that he wanted to file a lawsuit. Jia Ruxin tricked him out of the village during the day and killed him. When Sun Zhanxiang was dragged to the sorghum field, he shouted, "I am Sun Zhanxiang! Fellow villagers, spare me..." People nearby heard the shouts clearly, but no one dared to approach. Sun Zhanxiang's mouth was stuffed with rags, his neck was strangled with a puttee, and he was hacked eleven times all over his body. At that time, Sun Zhanxiang's wife ran around seeking help and filing a lawsuit against the murderer Jia Ruxin, but it was of no use. She didn't even dare to stay in the village and had to take her children to live elsewhere.

    Zhang Si of Sihezhuang was killed while working in the field. That day, Jia Ruxin led a team to "suppress bandits." Because there were no "bandits" to "suppress," Jia Ruxin ordered his men to shoot at farmers at will in order to report his achievements. No matter how Zhang Si held up his hoe and shouted that he was a good citizen, they shot Zhang Si twice and killed him, and then shot through Wang Xipeng's leg. After Zhang Si's death, his wife suffered much hardship to support herself and the four children she left behind. And Wang Xipeng sold the more than ten mu of land and a donkey that his father and son had accumulated for more than ten years to treat his leg injury. As a result, Wang Xipeng became disabled.

    Jia Rufen initially gained power by killing revolutionary cadres and undermining revolutionary organizations. In 1947, he captured a dozen people who had come from the Jizhong Liberated Area, tied them up in the township office, and tortured them to extract information about revolutionary cadres. Later, he further undermined the revolutionary organization in Beijing. A total of nine revolutionary cadres were killed by him. As a result, he was rewarded by the Kuomintang military police and became sworn brothers with a certain captain. With this backing, the puppet township head Jia Rufen became even more unscrupulous.

    Jia Ruxin privately levied money from the people to take a third concubine. Jia Rufen openly took the grain money for buying soldiers for the whole township to Beijing and Tianjin, renting hotel rooms for months, eating, drinking, and gambling. The people said that he spent three dan of grain every day. In return, he would go to various villages to arrest young men by force. During these days, the young people in the surrounding villages did not dare to work in the fields during the day, and did not dare to sleep at home at night. In the winter snow, people hid in the fields all night, huddled in piles of firewood. If young people could not be caught, he would catch old people, forcing them to exchange them for young people. Or simply hold them for ransom like kidnapping. In the village, whoever offended him would be threatened with "being in league with the Eighth Route Army," and would be beaten and fined if caught in the township office. Countless people were beaten and fined by him. Usually, he wandered around with a pistol in his hand, and if anyone said something wrong, he would say "I'll shoot you!" He could catch other people's chickens and kill other people's pigs to eat at will, and deny payment after buying other people's things. Many people worked for his family without pay, and small vendors would be beaten by him if they said something wrong. Once, two vegetable vendors bought vegetables in his vegetable garden. Because there was a dispute over the price with his family, Jia Rufen beat them with a belt until their faces were bleeding and they knelt down and shouted "Third Master Jia," and finally they had to kowtow and apologize, and were never allowed to come to Yinghaizhuang again.

    As for the Jia family's usual practice of using large measures to collect rent and demand good grain, and using small measures to pay wages and give bad grain, such things are too numerous to mention. The workers who worked for the Jia family all complained bitterly, eating bad food and hurrying to work. Once, the workers didn't eat and returned the food. The Jia family said that it was the foreman An Wenbin who came up with the bad idea. Later, the Jia family's ewe had a miscarriage, and they insisted that it was An Wenbin who had beaten her. An Wenbin was taken to the police station, beaten, fined, and had half a year's wages deducted. After he came out, he was caught by Jia Rufen and forced into the army.

    Jia Rufen often used the pretext of checking household registrations to rape women in farmers' homes at night. Many women in Yinghaizhuang were defiled, suffering in their hearts and dared not speak out. Everyone in the village knew that on the night of Yin Shuangqing's wedding, Jia Rufen occupied Yin's newlywed wife. They slept on the kang, and ordered Yin Shuangqing to sleep on the floor, and ordered him to buy wine and cigarettes to serve them. Later, Jia Rufen took Yin Shuangqing's wife to Beijing. When he was tired of playing with her, he sold her to others. Yin Shuangqing's mother had no one to complain to and was simply angered to death.

    The tyrant Jia Rufen would do some shocking things at any time. Once, he met Li Jingfen's wife and ten-year-old daughter on the road, who were returning from picking up a handful of wheat in the field. He casually waved a foreign knife and broke the wheat, calling others to grab the wheat. Li Jingfen's wife argued with him, and Jia Rufen immediately demanded that the mother and daughter apologize. When the mother and daughter knelt down, Jia Rufen unbuttoned his pants and urinated on their heads.

    The people of Yinghaizhuang who have been ravaged have now reached the time to turn over. All the crimes of Jia Ruxin and Jia Rufen have been presented to the court after the masses' accusations at the meeting. The People's Government has arrested Jia Ruxin. The people of Yinghaizhuang believe that their court will give Jia Ruxin the punishment he deserves. Although Jia Rufen has fled in fear of punishment, the people's blood feuds will one day be avenged.

　　瀛海庄的两恶霸
    林  沫
    北京市南郊十四区有个瀛海庄。在解放以前，附近一带村子的老百姓都害怕到这村去。这是什么缘故呢？只是因为瀛海庄住着恶霸地主贾如欣、贾如芬两弟兄。他们横行霸道，行凶杀人，吊打百姓，奸淫妇女，无恶不作，附近一带的老百姓都畏之如虎。
    这两个恶霸的叔父当过县长，父亲当过县政府秘书，他们家靠当官发财，在瀛海庄买下三百多亩土地，以后又靠收租剥削过日子。贾如欣在日本侵占时期，当过日军警备队小队长，还当过大兴县卫队长。贾如芬在日本投降后当过伪大乡长。十几年以来，他们吊打过上百的人，强奸过几十个妇女，亲手杀害了十四条人命。
    北京解放后，瀛海庄的群众即纷纷向人民政府控诉这两个恶霸的罪恶。最近，在土地改革工作组的领导下，瀛海庄和附近十几个村子的老百姓在十一月十四日联合召开了一个一千多人的控诉大会，许多被压迫的老百姓都诉出了他们过去无处诉的冤苦，揭露了恶霸贾如欣、贾如芬的血腥罪行。
    三槐堂村李大锁的娘自她唯一的儿子被贾如欣暗杀后，七八年来到处讨饭。她常常一个人跑到野地里哭儿子，找儿子，两眼都快要哭瞎了。她的儿子被贾如欣杀害的时候，听人说瀛海庄村西有个死尸，她想到那里去看看，又害怕再受贾家的迫害，尸首就放在那里一块一块的给狗扯完了。李大锁是个小商贩，在一九四一年从家里带着钱和一口袋玉米，到北京去办货，在路上碰到贾如欣所带的巡逻队，贾如欣借口大锁没有通行证，就抢了他的东西，又在夜里把他拉出去枪毙了。就在这一年，被贾如欣杀害的还有本村的孙占祥、四合庄的张四，另外还有王希朋被打断一条腿。
    那年瀛海庄在修村公所时，派大车拉砖，贾如欣自己开枪打死了两头骡子，但是他却在村里派款来赔偿。孙占祥因为缴不上款，被他吊打了一顿，孙占祥气不过，要去告状。贾如欣就在白天把他骗到村外杀害了。当孙占祥被拉到高梁地里的时候，还大喊着：“我是孙占祥呵！乡亲们饶了我吧……”这喊声附近的人都清楚听到了，但是谁也不敢近前。孙占祥被烂布塞着嘴，一条裹腿勒住脖子，浑身上下砍了十一刀。当时孙占祥老婆到处奔求，打官司控告凶手贾如欣，不但丝毫没用，她却连在村子里也不敢呆，只得带孩子躲到别处居住。
    四合庄张四被打死的时候正在地里做活。那天贾如欣带着队伍去“剿匪”。因为无“匪”可“剿”，贾如欣为了自己报功，就命令随便向农民开枪。不管张四怎么举着锄头高喊自己是好老百姓，他们两枪打死张四，接着又打穿了王希朋的腿。张四死后，他老婆为了养活自己和留下来的四个孩子，不知受了多少艰难痛苦。而王希朋因为医治腿伤，把他父子三个十几年扛活积蓄所买下的十几亩地和一头驴全卖了。结果王希朋还是成了废残。
    贾如芬开始是靠杀革命干部和破坏革命组织得势的。一九四七年，他抓到十几个从冀中解放区过来的人，将他们绑到乡公所，非刑拷打，从中侦察出革命干部。以后，又进一步破坏在北京的革命组织，总共被他杀害的革命干部有九个人。因此，他受到国民党宪兵队的奖赏，并和某队长结为盟兄弟。有了这种靠山，伪乡长贾如芬就更加为所欲为了。
    贾如欣曾私下向百姓派款，讨了第三个小老婆。贾如芬就公开拿全乡买兵的粮款到北京、天津，成月包下旅馆房间，吃喝嫖赌，老百姓说他每天要耗费三石粮食。回头，他再到各村武装抓捕壮丁。在这些日子里，这一带村子里的青年们白天不敢下地做活，夜里不敢在家睡觉。冬雪天，人们成夜躲在野地里，躜在柴草堆里。青年人抓不到，他就抓老年人，逼着他们拿青年人去换。或者干脆象绑票一样让人拿钱去赎。在村里，谁得罪他，就以“通八路”相威胁，抓到乡公所就是打罚。老百姓被他打过罚过的不知有多少。平常，他扣着手枪到处游串着，遇谁说话不对，开口就是“枪崩了你！”他可以随便捉人家的鸡，杀人家的猪吃，买了人家的东西转身不认账，很多人给他家做了活不开工钱，卖东西的小商贩说话不对就会挨他的打。有一次，两个菜贩子买他菜园里的菜。因为说价钱和他家里的人发生争执，给贾如芬用皮带打得顺脸流血，跪下直喊贾三爷，最后还得磕头赔罪，以后还永不许再来瀛海庄。
    至于贾家平时收租用大斗，要好粮；开工资就用小斗，给坏粮，类似这样的事就更不胜说了。给贾家做活的工人更是人人叫苦，他们吃坏饭，赶紧做活，有一次工人不吃把饭退回去，贾家说这是工头安文彬出的坏主意。后来贾家的母羊流产，就赖定是安文彬打坏的，安文彬被带到警察所，挨了打，受了罚，扣了半年工资，出来以后又被贾如芬抓去当了兵。
    贾如芬常常以查户口为名，黑夜到农民家里强奸妇女。瀛海庄有很多妇女被糟踏，苦在心里不敢说。村里人都知道，在尹双庆结婚的晚上，贾如芬霸占了尹新婚的妻子，他们在炕上睡觉，叫尹双庆睡在地下，还命令他打酒、买烟来侍候。后来，贾如芬把尹双庆的妻子弄到北京。玩厌了，又把她卖给别人。尹双庆的母亲有苦无处说，就活生生地被气死了。
    恶霸贾如芬随时都会作出一些骇人听闻的事。有一次，他在路上遇到李景芬的老婆和十岁的女儿从地里拾了一把麦子往回走。他顺手挥起洋刀把麦了挑开，叫别人来抢麦子。李景芬老婆和他争吵，贾如芬当场要母女两人赔罪，当母女两个跪下来贾如芬就解开裤子，用尿往她们头上浇。
    瀛海庄被蹂躏的人民现在已到了翻身的时候，对贾如欣、贾如芬所有的罪行经过群众在大会上的控诉，已呈交法院，人民政府已将贾如欣逮捕，瀛海庄人民相信自己的法院将给贾如欣以应有的惩处。贾如芬虽然畏罪潜逃，但人民的血海冤仇总有一天要报的。
