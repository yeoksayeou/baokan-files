Comrades! Friends!

The seventieth birthday of the world revolution's teacher, the great Stalin, is approaching. People of all countries are celebrating this day. The Chinese people are also holding grand celebrations throughout the country. The Chinese people's celebration of Stalin's birthday is also a celebration of their own revolutionary victory. Because without Stalin, without the Soviet Union created and built under Stalin's leadership, without the help of Stalin and the Soviet Union, it is unimaginable that the Chinese people's revolution could have achieved victory so quickly.

The Chinese people's struggle against semi-colonial and semi-feudal enslavement has lasted for more than a hundred years since the Opium War. Several major revolutions and reform movements—the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Xinhai Revolution—all failed. Sun Yat-sen, who called himself "devoted to the national revolution for forty years," concluded on his deathbed that "the revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must continue to work hard." This was the plight of the Chinese people in the eighty years after the Opium War. But since the Russian October Revolution, since Lenin and Stalin led the creation and construction of the Soviet Union, the situation has completely changed. Under the influence and with the help of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people learned Marxism-Leninism, produced new revolutionary leaders—the Communist Party—from their own nation, and achieved a basic victory on a national scale after twenty-eight years of struggle. Is this a coincidence? Can one imagine that the Chinese people could have achieved such a victory without the existence of the Soviet Union and its leader, Stalin? Of course not!

On November 30, 1926, Stalin gave a speech at the Chinese Committee of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, entitled "The Future of the Chinese Revolution." He pointed out that one of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution was that "the Soviet Federation exists and develops next to China, and its revolutionary experience and assistance will not fail to alleviate the Chinese proletariat's struggle against imperialism and medieval feudal remnants." He also said: "The Chinese revolution is developing in a situation where it is possible to utilize the experience and assistance of the Soviet revolution that has won victory," which can make the "road of revolutionary development easier" for China.

Indeed, the Chinese people suffered aggression from the imperialist countries of the world and were oppressed by thousands of years of feudal rule. The enemies of the revolution were extremely powerful, and the struggle was very arduous and difficult. However, after the October Revolution, thanks to "utilizing the experience and assistance of the Soviet revolution that had won victory," and thanks to the help of Stalin and the Soviet people, the burden of revolutionary struggle was "alleviated," and the "road of revolutionary development became easier." Therefore, basic victory was achieved in a relatively short period.

Before the Russian Revolution, the Chinese people did not have "the victorious revolutionary experience" of the Soviet Union to learn from. Before that time, as Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," China's advanced people could only learn from the bourgeois countries of Europe and America. But what they learned from the bourgeois countries of Europe and America was, at most, only the revolutionary experience of the bourgeoisie, not the revolutionary experience of the broad masses of the people. Such experience was already outdated in the era of imperialism, and it was completely unsuitable for the Chinese people's revolutionary movement to liberate themselves from the oppression of imperialism and feudal forces. The repeated failures of the Chinese revolution before the May Fourth Movement proved this point. But after the Russian Revolution, the situation was completely different. The first country in the world that overthrew imperialist rule appeared, and the first proletarian dictatorship, which was also the rule of the broad working people, appeared. The Soviet people's victorious experience became a model for the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of all countries in the world. The Chinese people, who had suffered many failures in the revolutionary struggle, finally saw the bright road and eagerly learned from the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience. This also included Sun Yat-sen, who also realized that the Chinese revolution "cannot succeed without taking Russia as its teacher."

In order to learn from the Russian revolutionary experience, the Chinese people should thank Stalin in two ways. First, Stalin, together with Lenin, and inheriting from Lenin, led the Soviet people to create the experience of revolutionary victory, providing a model for the Chinese people to learn from. Second, Stalin personally did a lot of work on how to "utilize" the Russian revolutionary experience in China, and how to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and thereby made many "great theoretical contributions" to the Chinese revolution. Regarding this point, regarding the great significance of this matter for the Chinese revolutionary movement, Comrade Chen Boda's article "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution," published a few days ago, has made a very systematic and good explanation, so I will not say much about it here.

Stalin not only gave the Chinese people valuable assistance in theory and thought but also gave them valuable assistance in practical action. Before the Russian October Revolution, the Chinese revolution was actually isolated. At that time, imperialism ruled all regions of the world. And what imperialism wanted to do was "to cut open the living flesh of national China," that is, it would never allow the Chinese nation to exist independently. A genuine revolutionary movement would never receive assistance from any imperialist country. On the contrary, it would be subjected to all kinds of sabotage by imperialism. Anyone who has studied the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to the Xinhai Revolution can easily know the role that the sabotage of imperialism played in the failure of these revolutionary movements. All the "friends" that the Chinese people met at that time who seemed to show a little sympathy were actually, as Chairman Mao said, "friends" like Li Linfu of the Tang Dynasty, who were "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted." The reason why these "friends" sometimes pretended to show a little sympathy for the Chinese people was because they wanted to use the power of the Chinese people to gain more imperialist privileges in China from other imperialist countries. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism acted as a "friend" of China and obtained almost exclusive privileges from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

After the Russian October Revolution, the world saw the emergence of true friends of the Chinese people and all oppressed nations and oppressed people. The Chinese people saw many "unprecedented righteous deeds in the history of mankind" in the newly established Soviet state. From the first day of its establishment, it issued a declaration to the people of all countries in the world proposing to "establish a solid and lasting peace." Then, in December 1917, it announced to the Eastern countries that it would abandon all the illegitimate rights of the Tsarist era and proposed to the Chinese government to conduct negotiations to abolish unequal treaties and establish equal and friendly treaties. At that time, the Chinese government was the government of the Beiyang warlords, the lackeys of imperialism. Such a government did not want the Chinese people to be liberated. Naturally, it ignored the Soviet Union's friendly proposal. The Soviet Union had no choice but to issue a declaration directly to the Chinese people in July 1919, reaffirming its desire for friendship and equality with China, abandoning all the privileges obtained by Tsarist Russia through aggression against China, and expressing its sincere desire to assist the Chinese people: "We are very willing to assist the movement of the Eastern nations, especially the Chinese people, who want to break away from the shackles of imperialist military and financial power. We want to assist not only the Soviet working class but also the Chinese people." The Chinese people, who had long suffered from imperialist oppression, naturally welcomed such a declaration very enthusiastically. We only need to browse through the Chinese newspapers and magazines of that time, and look at the telegrams of response from various industrial, agricultural, commercial, and academic groups and newspapers and magazines at that time, to imagine the joy and excitement of people from all walks of life in China at that time.

From then on, the Chinese people's revolutionary movement received truly practical assistance from foreign friends. As everyone knows, during the First Great Revolution, the Guangzhou government, which was the revolutionary base at that time, was opposed and sabotaged by various imperialist powers, especially British imperialism, and the situation was very difficult. It was only thanks to the help of the Soviet Union that it developed rapidly. Many letters left by Sun Yat-sen explained the decisive role played by the Soviet Union's assistance at that time. The rapid victory of the period 1925-1927 would have been unimaginable without the help of the Soviet Union.

Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Great Revolution, implemented anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people policies, and undermined the Chinese people's revolutionary forces, giving Japanese imperialism the opportunity to seize Chinese territory. In 1932, the "September 18th Incident" occurred. In such an unfortunate period for the Chinese people, only the Soviet Union, despite the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet government, still, through Foreign Minister Litvinov, issued a solemn warning to Japan less than a week after the incident, declaring that "the Soviet Union completely sympathizes with China morally, spiritually, and emotionally, and is willing to provide all necessary assistance." At the same time, it proposed to the Chiang Kai-shek government to restore diplomatic relations. Under the pressure of the national people's fervent demand for the restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, after repeated delays, China and the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations at the end of 1933. After the restoration of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed the establishment of a collective security system for the Pacific, and proposed the conclusion of a Sino-Soviet non-aggression treaty and even a Sino-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. Because Chiang Kai-shek ignored the Soviet Union's proposals and continued to implement anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people policies, he finally provoked a new offensive by Japanese imperialism.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union was the first and the most generous country to help China. As everyone knows, in the early stage of the War of Resistance, American imperialism sold a large amount of scrap iron to Japan to help the enemy build weapons to invade China. At that time, only the Soviet Union provided China with US$300 million in war materials, and sent a large number of aviation talents and military experts to participate in China's war of resistance. Many Soviet citizens sacrificed their lives in China's war of resistance. As a result of the eight-year war of resistance, it was still the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast that finally helped defeat Japan. Without the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast to quickly eliminate the main force of the Japanese army, Japan would not have surrendered so quickly, and the Chinese people's arduous war of resistance would have been prolonged for some time.

The above are just a few of the most obvious facts of the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese people, and other more specific facts have been omitted. It should be pointed out that all these assistance were carried out under the leadership of Stalin.

Chairman Mao said at the meeting celebrating Stalin's sixtieth birthday in Yan'an ten years ago: "In the past, Marxism-Leninism guided the world revolution in theory. Now, something has been added, which can help the world revolution materially. This is Stalin's contribution." Indeed, in terms of China's history of the past two decades, Stalin has both assisted the Chinese revolution in theory and in material terms. Stalin led the Soviet people to build a powerful socialist country, and therefore had a powerful material force to help the Chinese revolution.

The history of the past two decades has proved Stalin's foresight. The Soviet Union has won. The revolutionary experience and assistance have greatly reduced the burden of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and the road of revolutionary development has become much easier. China's land is so vast, and its domestic and foreign enemies are so powerful. Therefore, before the Russian October Revolution, the revolutionary struggle was carried out for seventy or eighty years, and it repeatedly failed. After the Russian October Revolution, the enemies of the Chinese revolution became even more ferocious, but after only two or three decades, the revolution was victorious.

From this, it can be seen that without Stalin and without the Soviet Union, there would be no victory for the Chinese people today. We celebrate Stalin's birthday to celebrate our victory today.

We celebrate Stalin's birthday to make everyone understand more the value of the Soviet Union's experience and assistance given by Stalin. We have only achieved the first step of victory today, and we still need to strive for more victories. In order to make our victory come sooner, we still need more help from Stalin and the Soviet people, and we need to further learn from the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience and construction experience!

We celebrate Stalin's birthday to further consolidate and expand the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and to oppose the various rumors and conspiracies of the reactionaries to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

Long live Stalin!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

　　斯大林怎样援助了中国人民
    艾思奇
    同志们！朋友们！
    世界人民革命的导师，伟大斯大林的七十岁生日就到了。各国人民都在庆祝这一个日子。中国人民也在全国各地举行盛大的庆祝。中国人民庆祝斯大林的生日，也就是庆祝自己的革命的胜利。因为如果没有斯大林，如果没有斯大林领导着创造和建设起来的苏联，没有斯大林和苏联的帮助，中国人民的革命，要这样迅速地得到胜利，是不能想象的。
    中国人民反对半殖民地半封建奴役的斗争，从鸦片战争以来，经过了一百多年。几次大的革命和改革运动——太平天国、戊戌政变、义和团运动、辛亥革命，都失败了。孙中山先生自称“致力于国民革命凡四十年”，而临死时的结论仍然是“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力”。这就是鸦片战争以后八十多年间中国人民的遭遇。但是自从俄国十月革命以后，自从列宁、斯大林领导着创造和建设了苏联以后，情形就完全改变了。在苏联的影响和帮助之下，中国人民学到了马克思列宁主义，在自己民族中间产生了新的革命领导者——共产党，经过了二十八年的奋斗，就取得了全国规模的基本胜利。这难道是偶然的现象吗？离开了苏联及其领导者斯大林的存在，能设想中国人民可以有这样的胜利吗？当然不能！
    一九二六年十一月三十日斯大林在共产国际执行委员会中国委员会里作了一篇讲演，题目是“论中国的前途”。他指出中国革命的特点之一就是“在中国旁边存在着和发展着苏维埃联邦，它的革命经验和它的协助，不会不减轻中国无产阶级对帝国主义和中世纪封建残余的斗争”。又说：“中国的革命是在可能利用苏联胜利了的革命的经验和帮助的情形之下而发展的”，这就可以使中国的“革命发展道路比较容易些”。
    的确是这样，中国人民遭受到世界帝国主义各国的侵略，又遭受着几千年来的封建统治的压迫，革命的敌人是极强大的，斗争是非常艰苦的，非常困难的。然而在十月革命以后，由于“利用苏联胜利了的革命经验和援助”，由于得到斯大林和苏联人民的帮助，革命的斗争担负就“减轻了”，“革命发展道路比较容易些”了，因此在较短的时间里就获得基本的胜利了。
    在俄国革命以前，中国人民没有象苏联那样的“胜利了的革命经验”可以学习。在那时以前，正如毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里所说的，中国的先进的人们只能向欧美资产阶级国家学习，但是从欧美资产阶级国家所学习到的，最多也只是资产阶级的革命经验，而不是广大人民的革命经验，这样的经验到了帝国主义时代已经过时了，对于争取从帝国主义和封建势力压迫下解放出来的中国人民革命运动，是完全不适合了。五四运动以前，中国革命的屡次失败证明了这一点。但是俄国革命以后，情形就完全不同了，世界上出现了第一个打倒了帝国主义统治的国家，出现了第一个无产阶级专政的同时也就是广大劳动人民统治的国家。苏联人民的胜利的经验就成为世界一切国家被压迫人民和被压迫民族学习的榜样。在革命斗争中遭受了多次失败的中国人民，这一下才看见了光明的道路，热烈地向苏联学习革命的经验，这里面还包括了孙中山先生，他也认识到了中国革命“非以俄为师，断无成就”。
    为了学习俄国革命经验，中国人民应该从两方面感谢斯大林。第一，斯大林和列宁一起，并继承着列宁，领导苏联人民创造了革命胜利的经验，使中国人民得到学习的榜样。第二，斯大林在如何“利用”俄国革命经验于中国的问题上，如何把马列主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的问题上，他亲自做了许多工作，并由此在中国革命问题上，作了许多的“伟大理论贡献”。关于这一点，关于这一件事对于中国革命运动的重大意义，在前几天发表的陈伯达同志的一篇文章“斯大林与中国革命”里，曾经作了很有系统的很好的说明，我在这里就不多说了。
    斯大林不但在理论方面思想方面给了中国人民以宝贵的帮助，而且在实际行动方面也给了中国人民以宝贵的帮助。在俄国十月革命以前，中国的革命实际上是孤立的。那时是帝国主义统治着世界一切的地域。而帝国主义所要做的事情，是“从民族的中国之活的肉体上开刀”即决不是要容许中国民族独立地存在，真正的革命运动，决不会得到任何一个帝国主义国家的援助，而相反地却要遭受到帝国主义的各式各样的破坏，凡是稍稍研究一下太平天国到辛亥革命历史的人，很容易知道帝国主义的破坏，对于这些革命运动的失败所起的作用。那时中国人民所遇见的一切似乎也表示一点同情的“朋友”，实际上是象毛主席所说的，象唐朝李林甫一类的“口蜜腹剑”的“朋友”，这些“朋友”之所以有时也装着表示一点对中国人民的同情，是因为想利用中国人民的力量，向别的帝国主义国家争取在中国获得更多的帝国主义特权，譬如美帝国主义在抗日战争期间作了中国的“朋友”，就曾经在国民党反动统治的手里，取得了几乎独占一切的特权。
    俄国十月革命以后，世界上才出现了中国人民及一切被压迫民族被压迫人民的真正的朋友。中国人民在新成立的苏联国家那里看见了许多“世界人类从来未有之义举”。它从成立的第一天起，就向世界各国人民发表宣言提议“树立巩固永久的和平”，接着就在一九一七年十二月向东方各国宣布放弃帝俄时代的一切不正当的权利，并向中国政府提议进行废止不平等条约而建立平等友好条约的谈判。当时中国政府是帝国主义走狗北洋军阀的政府，这样一个政府，是不希望中国人民得到解放的，对于苏联的友好的提议自然就不加理会。苏联不得已，又在一九一九年七月，直接对中国人民发表宣言，重申对中国友好平等的意愿，放弃一切帝俄时代侵略中国所得的各种特权，并表示了援助中国人民的热诚愿望：“我们对东方民族，尤其对中国人民想脱离帝国主义武力财力的羁绊的运动，是很想予以援助的，我们不仅想援助苏联劳动阶级，而且想援助中国人民。”长期遭受帝国主义压迫的中国人民，对于这样的宣言自然是非常的热烈欢迎了。我们只要把当时中国的报纸杂志翻阅一下，看看当时工农商学各团体各报纸杂志的响应的电文，就可以想见当时中国各界人民欢欣鼓舞的情形。
    从此以后，中国人民的革命运动才得到真正实际的国外朋友的援助。大家知道，在第一次大革命的期间，当时革命根据地的广州政府，遭受着各帝国主义尤其是英帝国主义的反对和破坏，情形是很困难的，只是由于苏联的帮助，才迅速发展起来。孙中山遗下的许多书信，都说明苏联当时的援助所起的决定作用。一九二五——一九二七一个时期迅速胜利，没有苏联的帮助是不能设想的。
    蒋介石叛变了大革命，实行了反苏反共反人民，破坏了中国人民的革命力量使日本帝国主义有机会来强夺中国的领土。一九三二年，“九一八”的灾难发生了。在中国人民的这样一个大不幸的时期。只有苏联，尽管蒋介石已经和苏联政府断绝邦交了，仍然经过外长李维诺夫，在事变发生不到一个礼拜的时间，就向日本提出严正的警告，声明“苏联在道义上、精神上、情感上完全同情中国，并愿尽一切必要的帮助。”同时向蒋介石政府提议恢复邦交。在全国人民热烈要求中苏复交的压力下，经过一拖再拖，中苏两国在一九三三年底复交了。复交以后，苏联又屡次提议建立集体保卫太平洋安全制度，提议订立中苏互不侵犯条约以至于中苏互助协定。由于蒋介石不理睬苏联的建议，继续执行反苏反共反人民的政策，终于又引起了日本帝国主义的新进攻。
    抗日战争中间，苏联是援助中国最早和最多的国家。尽人皆知，抗战初期，美帝国主义曾把大量废铁卖给日本，资助敌寇制造侵略中国的武器。那时只有苏联，把三万万美元的作战物资援助中国，派遣了大批的航空人才和军事专家来参加中国抗战，不少苏联公民在我国抗战中牺牲了生命。八年抗战的结果，最后帮助打败日本的，仍然是苏联对东北的出兵。如果没有苏联出兵东北，迅速消灭了日本陆军的主力，日本决不会那样快投降，中国人民的艰苦的抗战一定还要延长一个时候。
    以上只是提到苏联帮助中国人民的几件最明显的事实，而省略了其他更多的具体事实。应该指出，这些援助，都是在斯大林的领导下进行的。
    毛主席在十年前延安庆祝斯大林六十寿辰的大会上说：“在过去，马克思列宁主义，在理论上指导世界革命，现在加上了一点东西，可以在物质上帮助世界革命了，这就是斯大林的功劳。”的确是这样，就中国二十几年的历史来说，斯大林是既在理论上援助了中国革命，又在物质上援助了中国革命。斯大林领导着苏联人民建设起强大的社会主义国家，因此也就有强大的物质力量来帮助中国革命。
    二十几年来的历史证明斯大林的预见，苏联胜利了。革命经验和帮助，使中国人民的革命斗争的担负大大地减轻，革命发展的道路比较容易得多了。中国的土地这样广大，国内外的敌人这样强大，因此在俄国十月革命以前革命斗争进行了七八十年，总是再三地失败。而在俄国十月革命以后，中国革命的敌人更凶恶了，但是只经过了二三十年的时间，革命就胜利了。
    由此可见，没有斯大林、没有苏联，不会有中国人民今天的胜利。我们庆祝斯大林的寿辰，也就是庆祝我们今天的胜利。
    我们庆祝斯大林的寿辰，就是要使大家更加懂得珍贵斯大林所给予的苏联的经验和援助。我们今天只取得了第一步的胜利，我们还需要争取更多的胜利。为着使我们的胜利更快一些到来，我们还需要斯大林和苏联人民更多的帮助，还需要进一步学习苏联的革命经验和建设经验！
    我们庆祝斯大林的寿辰，要进一步巩固和扩大中苏人民的友谊，反对反动派破坏中苏人民友谊的各种造谣和阴谋行为！
    斯大林万岁！
    中苏人民友好万岁！
