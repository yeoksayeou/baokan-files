    Support the Issuance of the People's Victory Discounted Public Bonds!
　　Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions
  　Calls on Workers to Actively Subscribe
    [Beijing News] Xiao Ming, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, issued a statement supporting the Central People's Government's decision to issue People's Victory Discounted Public Bonds. The statement said: "We Beijing workers resolutely support the Central People's Government's decision to issue these discounted public bonds. Because this decision can strive for price stability, solve the current national financial and economic difficulties, and is conducive to restoring and developing production. When national production is well developed in the future, the national financial and economic problems can be fundamentally solved, and China can become a strong New Democratic country. Therefore, the government's current decision is beneficial to the people of the whole country, especially to our working class, because more stable prices will facilitate the development of production, make it easier for unemployed workers to return to work, and provide greater security for the lives of employed workers. Therefore, in addition to calling on all workers in the city to actively subscribe to public bonds, our trade union will also launch effective mass production and conservation movements in various factories to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs, so as to increase national fiscal revenue, reduce the burden on the people, and lay a solid foundation for the national finance and economy."

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！
　　北京总工会筹委会主任萧明
  　号召工人踊跃认购
    【北京讯】市总工会筹委会主任萧明发表谈话，拥护中央人民政府发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，谈话称：“我们北京工人坚决拥护中央人民政府这次发行折实公债的决定。因为这个决定可以争取物价的稳定，解决目前国家财政经济上的困难，并有利于恢复与发展生产，等到将来全国生产发展好了，就可以根本地解决国家财政经济问题，并使中国成为一个强大的新民主主义的国家。所以，目前政府的这个决定是对全国人民有利的，特别是对我们工人阶级有利，因为物价比较稳定，就好发展生产，还可以使失业工人容易复业，在业工人的生活更得到保障，所以我们工会除了号召全市工人踊跃认购公债外，还要在各工厂中发动有效的群众性的生产节约运动，增加产量，提高质量，减低成本，来增加国家的财政收入，减轻人民的负担，打下国家财政经济的雄厚基础。”
