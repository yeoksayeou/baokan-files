　　Experience of Running Spare-time Schools at the Revolutionary University
    Zhang Huaiqiang
    Editor's Note: The experience of the spare-time school at the Revolutionary University is good. The "package class system" they adopted is a new approach and has achieved good results. However, this method is implemented under the following conditions: 1. Package class is the main focus, with supplemental courses as secondary; 2. Teachers have relatively high cultural levels (university students); 3. Each package class teacher only teaches two subjects. If these conditions are absent, the "package class system" will keep teachers busy all day preparing courses, making it difficult to deepen their professional knowledge, which will inevitably affect the teaching effect. Therefore, when referring to the Revolutionary University's experience, localities must pay attention to this.
    I. General Situation
    The spare-time school of the North China People's Revolutionary University was established in late September under the direct leadership of the Academic Affairs Office, according to the instructions of the school Party committee, and in accordance with the regular school system and scale. All staff members of the school who had less than a junior high school education were required to participate in the study. There were a total of 636 students. Among them, cadres accounted for 24 percent, and general staff accounted for 76 percent, with more than 40 types of positions; in terms of education level, illiterates and semi-illiterates accounted for 57 percent, those equivalent to elementary school graduates accounted for 25 percent, and those equivalent to higher elementary school graduates or above accounted for 18 percent. The organization was basically divided into a junior middle school section, a senior elementary school section, and a junior elementary school section according to education level, with ten regular classes and two remedial classes. The curriculum focused on Chinese language as the main subject, supplemented by history, geography, arithmetic, general knowledge of nature, general knowledge of politics, and the history of social development, which were assigned according to grade level; the educational goal was to cultivate self-study ability and prepare conditions for strengthening theoretical study and enhancing work ability.

    After two months of teaching, the following results were achieved: Those in the first grade of junior elementary school who were originally illiterate can now recognize at least 80 characters and at most 130 characters, and can write the characters they have learned into sentences, achieving the ability to read, speak, write, and use them; in arithmetic, those who originally did not recognize Arabic numerals have now generally learned two-digit multiplication, and a few have learned division. Those in the second grade of junior elementary school who originally could recognize two or three hundred characters, but mostly could not write or form complete sentences, have now made rapid progress and can write short diaries. In the senior elementary school section, those who could write short essays of one or two hundred characters with awkward sentences and an average of 30 percent spelling errors at the beginning, now write more coherent essays with spelling errors reduced to 5 to 10 percent. Those in the junior middle school section who originally recognized many characters, but had no writing habits, did not understand punctuation, and could not grasp the central idea of articles, now write more coherent and organized diaries and compositions, can generally use punctuation, and are gradually learning to find the theme of articles.

    II. Regarding Teaching Work
    (1) Class Placement
    Organizing spare-time schools according to regular school systems is a complex task because the levels are extremely uneven, work positions are different, requirements are different, and especially the spare time of various work natures is difficult to unify. After exploration and repeated investigation and research, the preliminary solution is: regular classes are organized according to three principles: 1. the same cultural level (mainly Chinese language level); 2. the same spare-time study time; 3. the same nature of work. If all cannot be met, then a similar nature of work and cultural level shall be subordinate to the class time; for those with slight differences in level within the class, the "little teacher" system is adopted as assistance. The result of this implementation is that about one-third of the people still cannot attend regular classes on time. In addition to emphasizing the conscious implementation of institutional discipline and the effective guarantee of various administrative units, we have also adopted several auxiliary forms organizationally, namely, opening remedial classes, self-study classes, and auditing systems. This not only solves the learning problems of this part of the population, but also allows the regular classes, which account for more than two-thirds of the number of people, to proceed normally according to the teaching progress. In addition, the solution to the uneven arithmetic level is to divide each class in the same grade into Class A and Class B according to arithmetic level for classes, as far as possible without using mixed-age teaching methods. Experience has proved that these methods are of great help to the regularization of spare-time schools.

    (2) Academic System, Curriculum, and Teaching Materials
    The graduation is tentatively set at four and a half years, stipulating one and a half years for the junior middle school section, one year for the senior elementary school section, and two years for the junior elementary school section. Each grade is divided into two semesters, each semester lasting 20 weeks of classes (calculated according to the actual number of weeks of classes), with twelve hours of classes per week for six days, completing all the main courses of junior elementary school, senior elementary school, and junior middle school in four and a half years.
    The Chinese language course starts from literacy, aiming to reach the ability to recognize 500 characters and form continuous sentences in one year, to write simple diaries in two years, to write coherent short essays and read the Workers' Daily in three years, and to write reports and work summaries and read general theoretical books and general documents in four and a half years.
    Based on past teaching experience, we are likely to achieve this plan, but it must have the following necessary conditions to be guaranteed.
    First of all, the curriculum must have a focus. We firmly grasp the principle that Chinese language is the main course, and the other auxiliary courses are in the ratio of three to one in terms of weight. Because the objects are adults with strong comprehension ability, as long as the reading ability is improved, more knowledge can be obtained through self-study. Secondly, we oppose cyclical teaching materials and adopt progressive teaching materials. For example, history is not taught in junior elementary school, senior elementary school teaches from ancient history to modern history, and junior middle school teaches history of the past hundred years. Arithmetic uses the textbooks of senior elementary school, and is completed in three years from junior elementary school to senior elementary school graduation.
    The issue of textbooks is a major difficulty at present. The solution is to compile and select Chinese language and common knowledge by ourselves in the junior elementary school section, and temporarily select the textbooks reviewed and approved by the former North China People's Government Education Department for Chinese language above senior elementary school, and select loose-leaf auxiliary teaching materials. Arithmetic only extracts the algorithm descriptions from the textbooks of senior elementary school, and the calculation examples and problems are prepared by the teachers according to the specific situation.

    (3) Teaching Organization and System
    In terms of administrative organization, the president, vice president, and director of the Academic Affairs Office are all part-time, with two staff members (also teaching courses), and eight full-time teachers.
    In the allocation of courses, we take the special course and part-time course system as auxiliary, and the "package class system" as the main. The advantages of teachers "package class" are: 1. Teachers are easy to be familiar with the objects, and it is easy to grasp the progress and requirements. 2. Because each course in the class is taught by one person, the content can be interconnected and reviewed. 3. Teachers are specifically responsible for supervising and inspecting the listening situation, teaching progress, etc. of the class, which strengthens the teachers' sense of responsibility.
    We have organized four teaching groups by grade, stipulating that they meet every day and hold a meeting once a week to check the progress. The task is to collectively prepare courses, study teaching methods, and formulate progress plans; on this basis, an Academic Affairs Office meeting is held every two weeks. After more than two months of trial implementation, teachers reflect that it is of great benefit to teaching.
    On the student side, within the classroom, several mutual aid groups are organized in a mixed way according to different levels, which is a necessary organizational form to give play to the combination of learning initiative and collective mutual assistance.
    III. Several Teaching Experiences
    In the short period of two months, we have initially explored the following teaching experiences.
    First, teaching is carried out on the basis of self-study and mutual assistance.
    The specific application of self-study and mutual assistance is that all courses must be previewed and reviewed, and teachers must patiently guide this learning process. Problems that cannot be solved by the self-study and mutual assistance group are summarized by the teacher and submitted to the whole class for discussion. After concentrating various different understandings, the teacher clarifies the right and wrong and gives systematic and enlightening explanations. Every class is a process of mutual teaching. The teacher's responsibility is not only to teach, but also to be an organizer who is good at analyzing, researching, guiding, and discussing. The advantages of this method have been proved by experience: 1. Students listen carefully after active thinking and enthusiastic debate. 2. Mutual improvement and rapid progress. 3. Promote the spirit of active learning and quickly develop the ability to self-study.

    Second, less but refined, less teaching and more practice.
    The characteristics of spare-time schools are that students are older, have poor memory, and live scattered, and there is no opportunity for collective self-study guidance outside of class. If the progress is too fast, it will inevitably be too much to chew and affect the learning mood. The principle of less teaching and more practice means teaching a word or phrase and understanding a word or phrase, and thoroughly clarifying one lesson in each class. In addition, it is necessary to practice repeatedly. To learn a word or phrase, you must use it to write many sentences. To learn an article, you must repeatedly study it to achieve thorough understanding. On the one hand, you learn to apply it, and on the other hand, you use it as a weapon to preview new lessons.
    Under the principle of less but refined, teachers are required to clearly define the purpose and requirements when selecting teaching materials. It is not to delay time and blindly reduce the amount, but to reduce the amount for refinement, which is to lay a solid foundation and obtain more in the future from the improvement of self-study ability. At the beginning, we took detours, and now the correction method is that teachers and teaching groups formulate teaching plans every two weeks, which are discussed by mutual aid groups and become students' own learning plans, and checked every week after implementation. Now the Chinese language in junior middle school teaches at most two lessons a week, which has a greater effect than teaching more.

    Third, democratic grading of homework.
    Regarding the method of grading homework, we tried the democratic grading method in the junior middle school section. First, the teacher extracts and grades a part of the papers from each mutual aid group, and then distributes them to the mutual aid group for circulation and democratic discussion. First, study the reasons for deletion and revision. After debate, the teacher concentrates the different opinions and questions and combines them with grammar and essay writing in class to clarify the rules. Then, the ungraded papers are first graded by the students themselves, then graded by the mutual aid group, and finally graded by the teacher. This process generally takes up three class times, so it is generally stipulated to write one essay every two weeks, while diaries are emphasized to be written every day. Students reflected: "Self-grading is of great help to improving writing ability."

　　革大举办业余学校经验
    张怀璋
    编者按：革大业余学校的经验是好的。它们采行的“包班制”，是一种新的作法，并且已经获得好的效果。但这种方法是在下列情况下实行的：一、包班为主，兼课为辅；二、教员文化水平相当高（大学生）；三、每一个包班教员只教两门课。如果离开这些条件，则“包班制”会使教员终日忙于准备课程，业务不易精深，必然影响教学效果。因此，各地在参考革大经验时，对此须加以注意。
    一、一般情况
    华北人民革命大学业余学校，是九月下旬根据校党委指示，在教务处直接领导下，按照正规学校的学制和规模创办的。全校各部门工作人员，凡文化程度不及初中毕业者，一律参加学习。学员共六三六人。其中干部占百分之二四，一般工作人员占百分之七六，职别凡四十余种；文化程度，文盲与半文盲占百分之五七，相当初小毕业者占百分之二五，相当高小毕业以上程度者占百分之十八。编制基本上按文化程度分为初中部、高小部及初小部，下设十个正规班、两个补习班。课程以国文为主课，历史、地理、算术、自然常识、政治常识及社会发展史为辅课，按年级配备；教育目的是培养自修能力，为加强理论学习与增进工作能力准备条件。
    经过两个月的教学，收到如下的效果：初小一年级原来是文盲的，现在最少能识八十个字，最多能识一三○字，并且能把所识的字写成话，达到会念、会讲、会写、会用；算术原来不识阿拉伯字码的，现在一般学会了两位乘法，少数人学会了除法。初少二年级原来能识二三百字，但多半不会写，不会造完全的句子，现在进步快的已能写简短日记。高小部，初来时能写一二百字的短文，语句不顺，错别字平均占全文百分之三十，现在短文比前通顺，错别字已减少到百分之五至百分之十。初中部原来认字不少，但没有写作习惯，不懂标点符号，不会抓取文章中心要旨，现在日记作文比前通顺有条理，标点符号大体会运用，并逐渐懂得找寻文章主题了。
    二、关于教学工作
    （一）编班
    业余学校要按正规学制编班，是比较复杂的工作，因为程度极端不齐，工作岗位不同，要求不同，特别是各种工作性质不同的业余时间难统一。我们经过摸索与反复调查研究，初步解决的办法是：正规班按三条原则编班：１、文化程度相同（以国文程度为主）；２、业余学习时间相同；３、工作性质相同。如果不能尽合，则以相近的工作性质与文化程度服从于上课时间；对于班内程度稍有参差的，采取小先生制的办法作辅助。这样实行结果，经常还有约三分之一的人不能到正规班按时上课，我们除强调自觉执行制度纪律，与各行政单位有效保证外，从组织上又采取了几种辅助形式，即开设补习班、自修班以及旁听生制。这样不但解决了这一部分人的学习问题，而且使占三分之二以上人数的正规班，得以按教学进度正常地进行。另外关于算术程度不齐的解决办法，是以同年级的各班按算术程度分甲乙班上课，尽可能不用复式教授方法。经验证明，这些办法对业余学校的正规化有很大帮助。
    （二）学制、课程、教材
    暂定四年半毕业，规定初中部一年半，高小部一年，初小部二年。每一年级分前后两学期，每学期上课二十周（按实际上课周数计算），每周六次课共十二小时，在四年半内学完初小、高小、初中全部主要课程。
    国文课从识字起，一年要达到识五百字，造连续的句子，两年要达到写简单日记，三年要达到写通顺的短文，看工人日报，四年半要达到能写报告与工作总结，能阅读一般理论书和一般文件。
    根据过去一段教学经验，我们是有可能按照这个计划争取实现的，但必须具备以下必要条件，才有保证。
    首先，课程必须有重点，我们紧紧把握一条原则，以国语为主课，与其他辅课在分量上平均为三与一之比。因为对象是成年人，理解力强，只要把阅读能力提高了，更多的知识是可以自修获得的。其次，反对循环教材，而采用循序前进的教材。例如历史，初小不讲，高小从古代史到近代史，初中则讲近百年史。算术则采用高小课本，从初小一起到高小毕业分三年学完。
    关于课本问题，是当前一大困难。解决的办法，初小部国常自己编选，高小以上的国文暂选用前华北人民政府教育厅审订的课本，另选活叶辅助教材。算术只摘用高小课本的算法说明，算例、算题则由教员按具体情况自拟。
    （三）教学组织与制度
    行政编制，正副校长与教务主任均为兼职，另设干事二人（兼课），专任教员八人。
    在课程分配上，我们以专课、兼课制为辅，而以“包班制”为主，教员“包班”的好处：１、教员容易熟悉对象，便于掌握进步情况与要求。２、本班各门课程因为一人教授，内容上可以互相联系复习。３、教员对本班听课情况、教学进度等的督促检查，负有专责，这就加强了教员的责任心。
    我们按年级共组织了四个教学小组，规定每天碰头，每周开会检查一次，任务是集体准备课程，研究教学方法与拟定进度计划；在此基础上，每两周开教务会议一次。经过两个多月试行结果，教员反映对教学上大有好处。
    学生方面，在课堂内，按不同程度混合编成若干互助小组，为发挥学习自动性与集体互助相结合的一种必要的组织形式。
    三、几点教学经验
    在短短的两个月中，我们初步摸索到以下的教学经验。
    第一，在自学互助的基础上进行教学
    自学互助的具体运用就是一切课程必须经过预习复习，教员必须耐心指导这一学习过程。自学互助小组不能解决的问题，经教员加以综合提交全班讨论，集中各种不同的理解后，教员再明确正误，作系统的启发性的讲解。每一堂课都是相互教学的过程，教员的责任，不仅是讲课人，而且必须是善于分析研究指导讨论的组织者。这个方法的好处，经验证明：一、经过学员主动思考，热烈争论，听讲深刻。二、互相提高，进步快。三、发扬主动学习的精神，很快的可以养成自修能力。
    第二，少而精，少教多练
    业余学校的特点，学生年龄大，记忆力差，而又住处分散，课外没有集体自习指导的机会。如进度太快，必然贪多嚼不烂，影响学习情绪。少教多练的原则，教一个字词，懂一个字词，上一课就把一课彻底搞清。另外必须反复多练，学一个字词，必须编许多话来用它，学一篇文章，必须反复研究，达到透澈明了。一方面学着应用，一方面作为预习新课的武器。
    在少而精的原则下，要求教员在选讲教材时，就要明确目的与要求，不是拖延时间，盲目的少，而是求精的少，正是扎稳根基，从自修能力的提高上获得将来的多。开始时，我们走过弯路，现在纠正办法，由教员教学小组按两周制定教学计划，通过互助组讨论，成为学生自己的学习计划，执行后每周检查。现在初中国文一周最多讲两课，比多讲效果大。
    第三，民主评改作业
    关于作业的批改方法，初中部我们试用了民主评改方法。先由教员从每一个互助小组中抽改一部分卷子，然后发到互助组中传阅与民主讨论。先研究删改理由，经过争论，教员将分歧意见与疑问集中起来，结合文法与文章作法上课，把规律弄通。再将未改的卷子，先由学生自己改，然后互助小组改，最后由教员批改。这个过程一般要占去课堂内三次授课时间，所以一般规定两周作一次文，日记则强调天天写。学员反映：“自己批改，对写作能力提高帮助大”。
