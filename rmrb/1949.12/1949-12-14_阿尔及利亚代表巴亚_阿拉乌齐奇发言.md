Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: The following is a summary of the speech by Baya Alaouchiche, representative of the Algerian Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation, at the Third Asian Women's Representative Conference:

	I am extremely honored to have been selected as the Algerian representative to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference. On behalf of the women of Algeria, I extend fraternal congratulations to all the women present!

	I am particularly moved that this conference is being held in Beijing. Beijing, once the capital of a country under the shackles of imperialism, has now become a model for breaking free from the dual oppression of colonialism and feudalism. In our country, all male and female workers and all those who long for national liberation are wholeheartedly watching the Chinese people's struggle against the oppressors. China's victory has brought us infinite joy and hope and has supported our struggle!

	Although official statements declare Algeria to be a province of France, it is actually a colony with inequality in political, economic, and social aspects. Now, France is sending Algerian troops to Vietnam to confront the fraternal people fighting for independence. They force our sons to work in French arsenals. They have taken away our country's products, our food, oil, and raw materials.

	American imperialism is now planning to make Algeria play an important role in their planned war of aggression. Against the will of the Algerian people, they have forcibly included Algeria in the Atlantic Pact. The Atlantic coast of Morocco has become a landing place for Americans. American and British naval commanders have visited Algerian ports. They have established forty air force bases in Algeria. For future strategic and combat purposes, they have appointed generals and made the Aland Cardo cement plant ready to be turned into an explosive factory immediately.

	Our country is a rich country, but due to imperialist exploitation and rule, the people live in great suffering. Malnutrition and early famines have already reduced our population by one-tenth. Algerian women are devastated by family poverty, meager wages, and lack of social protection. Their children have no schools to attend. Every day, the pressing problem we face is how to feed our children. Women work in the fields with their children, as domestic servants, or in factories, and even these meager jobs are not available year-round. All this has been further worsened by war preparations and the Marshall Plan. When our people angrily rise up against these plans, democrats are arrested, newspapers expressing national ideas are shut down, and finally, the imperialists adopt their triumphant weapon in their war preparations—anti-communism and anti-Sovietism. Our struggle for peace and freedom is developing under these circumstances.

	Like Algeria and all other colonies, the national liberation movement includes the broad masses of oppressed people. Algerian women actively participate in this struggle. They bravely participate in the struggle for wages alongside men in all enterprises. The wives of dockworkers encourage their husbands to refuse to load ships bound for Vietnam. Algerian women have also made the greatest efforts in opposing war. Despite the threats and oppression of the government authorities, they conducted peaceful voting.

	The women of Algeria have instructed me to thank the women of all countries who have given us material and spiritual help. As the Soviet people celebrate the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin, our women express our gratitude to him for leading the Soviet people to eliminate Nazism and Japanese fascism from the world, and for his eternal defense of peace and the oppressed!

	We thank the Women's International Democratic Federation for making democratic women all over the world aware of our lives—the lives of women in colonies and dependent countries—and for uniting women to carry out a common struggle against imperialism.

	Mothers of the world unite and form an irresistible force against imperialist warmongers!

	Long live the international friendship of all women who help women in their respective countries gain their freedom!

　　阿尔及利亚代表巴亚·阿拉乌齐奇发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】国际民主妇联阿尔及利亚委员会代表巴亚·阿拉乌齐奇，在亚洲妇女代表会第三次会议上的发言，摘要如下：
    我极荣耀的被选为阿尔及利亚出席亚洲妇女代表会议的代表，谨代表阿尔及利亚妇女向所有到会的妇女致友爱的祝贺！
    特别使我感动的是这个会议在北京举行。北京曾是在帝国主义枷锁下的国家的首都，而今天已成为摆脱殖民主义及封建主义双重压迫而获得自由的表率了。在我国，所有的男女工人及所有盼望民族解放的人们都全心全意注视着中国人民反抗压迫者的斗争，中国的胜利带给我们无限的快乐与希望，支持了我们的斗争！
    虽然官方声明阿尔及利亚是法国的一省，但实际上它是一个殖民地，政治、经济和社会方面都是不平等的。现在，法国正把阿尔及利亚的军队送到越南去对抗为独立斗争的兄弟般的人民，他们强迫我们的儿子到法国兵工厂作工，他们夺走了我国的生产品，我们的粮食、油及原料。
    美国帝国主义现在正在计划使阿尔及利亚在他们准备中的侵略战争中饰演一个重要的角色。他们违反阿尔及利亚人民的意志，硬把阿尔及利亚包括在大西洋公约中，摩洛哥的大西洋海岸变成了美国人登陆的地方。美、英海军将领到过阿尔及利亚的港口。他们在阿尔及利亚建立了四十个空军基地。为了将来的战略和作战起见，他们已经派定了将领，并使阿兰的卡多水泥厂可以立刻变为炸药厂。
    我国是一个富饶的国家，但是由于帝国主义的剥削、统治，人民都生活在极大的痛苦里。我们因营养不够和早年饥荒已经减少人口十分之一。阿尔及利亚的妇女被家庭贫困、可怜的工资和缺乏社会保护所摧残。她们的儿童没有学校可进，每天我们面对着的迫切问题是如何才能养活我们的孩子。妇女们带着孩子在地里干活，当家庭佣人或在工厂里做工，而这种工资微薄的工作也不是整年都能得到的。这一切，由于战争准备，由于马歇尔计划而更加恶化了。当我们的人民愤怒地起来反对这些计划时，民主分子被逮捕了，表现民族思想的报纸被查封了，而最后则采用帝国主义在其准备战争中得意的武器——反共反苏。我们争取和平与自由的斗争是在这种情况下发展的。
    阿尔及利亚和其他一切殖民地一样，民族解放运动包括广大被压迫的人民群众。阿尔及利亚的妇女积极地参加了这个斗争。她们在一切企业中和男子一道英勇地参加争取工资的斗争。码头工人的妻子鼓励她们的丈夫拒绝替开往越南的船只载货。阿尔及利亚妇女在反对战争方面也作了最大的努力。她们不顾政府当局的威胁和压迫，进行了和平投票。
    阿尔及利亚的妇女嘱咐我向给我们物质和精神上帮助的各国妇女们致谢。当苏联人民庆贺斯大林大元帅七十寿辰时，我国妇女为了他领导苏联人民从世界上扫除了纳粹及日本法西斯主义，为了他永远保卫和平及被压迫者，向他表示我们的谢忱！
    我们向国际民主妇联致谢，因为它使全世界民主妇女认识了我们的生活——殖民地和附属国妇女的生活——以及把妇女团结起来进行反对帝国主义的共同斗争。
    全世界的母亲们团结起来，将形成对帝国主义战争挑拨者一个不可抗御的阻力！
    帮助妇女们在她们各自的国家中获取她们自由的全体妇女的国际友爱万岁！
