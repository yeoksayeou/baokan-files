Thoughts After the Tsinghua University Ethnic Minorities Cultural Relics Exhibition
    ——Also Discussing the Future of University Museums
    Chen Mengjia
    Tsinghua University held a three-and-a-half-day exhibition of cultural relics from Taiwan, Tibet, and southwestern ethnic minorities at the Beijing Fine Arts Academy from the afternoon of November 4th to the 7th. It attracted the attention of people from all walks of life and received many valuable criticisms. Through our own review, we also gained many practical lessons. Now, I will briefly write down my personal thoughts for the reference of those studying ethnic minorities, managing university museums, and holding special exhibitions.
    In terms of this exhibition, it was far from our ideal. This was anticipated beforehand, and we were very hesitant about it. First, there was no suitable exhibition hall in Beijing with sufficient lighting, display cabinets, and other material conditions. Second, our research work on the exhibits was not complete, resulting in brief and erroneous explanations. Third, limited by the school's funding, we could not have sufficient workers and all the necessary materials for the exhibition. However, considering the great significance of this exhibition for "welcoming the liberation of the vast border regions and promoting the culture of ethnic minorities," we dared to try holding an exhibition first. After six hours of venue arrangement, using eight pieces of cloth and several boxes of thumbtacks, and taking advantage of the Fine Arts Academy's ample lighting and large space, our twelve staff members finally displayed more than five hundred cultural relics.
    The cultural relics of southwestern ethnic minorities and Tibet were collected by our school over the years and have been regularly studied by specialists. Therefore, the preparation (especially the combination of objects, photos, and sculptures) was relatively complete. Half of the Taiwan Gaoshan ethnic group's cultural relics were only unpacked on the morning of the preview. The donation of this batch of cultural relics needs to be recounted. In the spring of 1948, we learned that Dr. Ding Huikang in Shanghai had collected Gaoshan ethnic group cultural relics after his return and had exhibited them in Shanghai and Hangzhou. In the summer of that year, I was ordered by the school to go to Shanghai to negotiate the purchase. Because the collector was not there, I could not fulfill my wish. This summer, I met Mr. Ding for the first time in Shanghai. I told him that we also needed to borrow his collection for research, and the public exhibition of this material had special significance at present. Mr. Ding understood our economic situation and, recognizing Tsinghua's achievements, generously lent it to us first. In mid-September, I brought back the more important and smaller items for preliminary sorting. In mid-October, Mr. Ding personally brought the remaining large items to Beijing. Seeing the school's library facilities and working conditions, he formally donated all of them on October 17th. However, we really do not have a full understanding of this material. The prehistoric life, modern history, geographical environment, racial origins, religious customs, family system, production methods, political organization, and the production of artworks of the Gaoshan ethnic group all require long-term research and the coordinated work of various related departments for comprehensive discussion before they can be completed. We especially need relevant Chinese and Japanese books, as well as photos and government reports as reference materials. At present, we have only started and have not made much progress.
    As mentioned above, exhibits and research objects, national museums and university museums are slightly different. The former's task is to treasure and display exhibits that can be exhibited (i.e., those that do not need to be or have already been studied). However, strictly speaking, national museums must also undergo research first. The task of university museums is to purposefully collect a certain type of research object, and use the results of their comprehensive research to transform the objects into teaching materials, so as to match the actual materials needed by each department, and to provide examples to students. Because only directly from objects can we easily appreciate the concrete manifestations of human history in production, institutions, and art, can we use them to test the actual proof of our theoretical or book-knowledge derived inferences. Therefore, the importance of university museums can be said to be equal to that of libraries and laboratories.
    However, university museums should not only be regarded as comprehensive research institutions within the scope of the school, but also, like general museums, should play a role in popular education. It not only purposefully collects materials, comprehensively studies them, and presents them in a systematic manner, but also regularly provides them to the public to understand the face of a certain topic and general culture. At the same time, it must also cooperate with national museums and research and excavation departments for special studies and individual identification and review. It needs to meet the needs of reality and remind the public of the knowledge of various aspects of culture and history within our country. For the current artistic creations, it can also provide historical knowledge to enrich the life of new art and understand our past environment.
    The author once visited museums in England, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United States and Canada to study museum issues and learned a little technical knowledge. But I never had the opportunity to go to the Soviet Union to obtain more valuable and important experience. This is not only my personal great regret, but I think it is also a great regret shared by many academic workers. In the future, under the correct leadership of our Central People's Government, how to develop close ties and mutual observation with the Soviet academic community is our urgent task. This is even more necessary for promoting our future museum undertakings. The Soviet Union's emphasis on and development of museums is well known. Just taking the numbers, it has already achieved amazing results. According to the statistics in 1939, there were about 800 museums, of which art galleries accounted for 88, history museums accounted for 49, natural science museums accounted for 44, industrial museums accounted for 55, and border region museums accounted for 399, half of the total number of museums. It can be seen that they attach great importance to border region culture.
    Our school museum was founded less than two years ago, and has always taken teaching cooperation, development research, and attention to border regions as its tasks. Therefore, we have considered the three departments of historical archaeology, ethnic minorities, and arts and crafts, and the participating departments are history, philosophy, geology, society, anthropology, Chinese language and literature, construction seven departments and the library. What we plan but have not done is the cultural exchange relics of countries bordering China and the public exhibition of natural sciences. We hope that in the near future, we can hold large-scale special exhibitions and establish permanent exhibition halls in the city for rotating exhibitions. This is the requirement received from all parties after this exhibition. In order to enrich the materials, we are very willing to do travel surveys and collect relics, and especially hope to develop to various border regions. We also hope that people from all walks of life will start the trend of turning private collections over to the public. During this exhibition, we also received some donations, and some enthusiastic friends promised to donate their collections to us. We believe that special exhibitions are very important, so we hope that there can be a modern exhibition hall in the city with all the conditions.
    The era of treating cultural relics as antiques for appreciation and ethnic minorities as uncivilized barbarians has passed. The new China in the future will draw lessons from history, develop and create a new culture according to the needs of the times; it will unite ethnic minorities and develop their economy and culture based on the principle of equality and mutual assistance. All of this requires a thorough understanding of the material conditions that have formed the past and present ethnic societies. Therefore, the excavation and collection of cultural relics is necessary. It is of profound significance that we call the Gaoshan ethnic group's cultural relics instead of using names such as "Fan goods." We should especially reflect that the cultural relics of all dynasties since ancient times are the concrete creations of the people's painstaking efforts. In the past, they were exclusively owned by the royal family and nobles, but now they should be returned to the people so that they can use these objects to understand the history of their ancestors' hard work and enjoy the works of art created by their ancestors' ingenuity. Although feudal society has passed, the cultural relics created by the people under feudal society should be praised, cherished, and sorted out for the people to use.

　　清华大学少数民族文物展后感
    ——并论大学博物馆的前途
    陈梦家
    清华大学于十一月四日下午至七日在北京城内艺专，举行了三天半台湾、西藏及西南少数民族文物展览，得到了社会人士的注意，并接收了许多宝贵的批评。在我们自己检讨之下，也获得了很多实际经验的教训。现在略写个人的感想，以为研究少数民族、办理大学博物馆及举行特种展览的商权。
    此次展出方面，离我们的理想还差的很远。这是事先早已料到的，而且很为此踌躇。第一，北京城内没有适当的展览室具有光线充足柜架设备，以及其它的物质条件。第二，我们对于展览品的研究工作尚未齐备，以致说明简略而有错误。第三，限于学校的经费，我们不能有充足的工作者和一切展览应需的材料设置。但是，为了此次展览对于“迎接广大边疆解放，发扬少数民族文化”有着重大的意义，我们乃敢尝试的先行展览一次。经过六小时的会场布置，用了八匹布和几盒图钉，并借光艺专礼堂的充分光线和较大的场面，我们十二位工作人员终于把五百件以上的文物陈列出来了。
    西南少数民族以及西藏文物是我校历年收藏的，又有专人经常研究，所以在准备上（尤其实物与照片塑像的配合）是比较完善的。台湾高山族文物，有一半是在预展的上午方才开箱的。这批文物的捐赠，有追述的必要。一九四八年春天，我们知道上海丁惠康医师在复员后，曾请人收集高山族文物，并在沪杭展览过。是年夏，奉学校之命到沪商洽收购。因收藏者不在，竟不能如愿。今年夏天我在上海与丁氏初次会面。告诉他，我们还需要借用研究他的藏品，并且这批材料的公开展览，在目前有其特殊的意义。丁氏了解我们经济情形，并承推许清华的成绩，慨然先予借藏。我于九月中带回了比较重要而较小的物品，先事整理。十月中丁氏亲自携带其余的大件北来，看到学校的图书设置以及工作情形，就于十月十七日正式全部捐赠。但我们对此批材料实在并无充分了解。高山族的史前生活，近代历史，地理环境，人种来源，宗教习惯，家族制度，生产方式，政治组织，艺术品的制作等都需要长时期的研究，并配合各有关学系的分头工作，综合的讨论，才可以完成的。我们尤需中日文有关书籍，以及照片，政府报告作对照的材料。在目前，我们只在开始着而并未进展多少。
    由上所述，则展出品与研究品，国家博物馆与大学博物馆是稍有其分别的。前者是以宝藏陈列可以展出的（即不需或已经研究了的）展出品为任务的，然严格地说，国家博物馆亦必需先经过研究。大学博物馆乃以有目的地收集某一类研究品为任务，以其综合研究的结果，变物品为教材，以配合各系所需的实物材料，以示例于学生。因为惟有直接从实物才容易体会到人类历史在制作、制度和艺术上种种的具体表现，才能用来考验我们理论上的或由书本知识所得到的推论之实际的证明。因此，大学博物馆的重要性与图书馆、实验室可说是相等的。
    但是，大学博物馆不应仅视作学校范围以内综合性的研究机构，它和一般博物馆一样，是应发挥其人民教育的作用的。它不但是有目的地搜集材料，综合的研究，作有系统的陈列，而且更应经常的供诸大众以了解某种专题和一般文化的面目。同时它也要和国家博物馆及研究发掘部分合作专题研究与个别的鉴定审别。它需要配合现实的需要，提醒大众对于本国境内各方面文化历史的认识。对于当前发展中的艺术创作，它也可以提供历史的知识，以充实新艺术的生命与了解我们过去的环境。
    作者前曾为了研究博物馆问题，曾参观英法瑞荷及美加等处的博物馆，学了一点技术上的知识。但始终没有机会到苏联去获取更可宝贵而重要的经验。这不仅是我个人的莫大遗憾，而且我想也是许多学术工作者所同感的莫大遗憾。今后在我们中央人民政府正确的领导下，如何开展与苏联学术界作紧密的联系与互相观摩，实是我们当务之急。这对于发扬我们今后博物馆事业，更是必需的。苏联对博物馆的重视与开展是众人所知的。就拿数字来说，已经有了惊人的成绩。据一九三九年的统计，约有八百所博物馆，其中美术陈列馆占八十八所，历史陈列馆占四十九所，自然科学阵列馆占四十四所，工业陈列馆占五十五所，而边疆陈列馆却占了三百九十九所，为博物馆总数的一半。可见他们对于边疆文化的重视。
    我校博物馆创始不及二载，向来以配合教学，发展研究，注意边疆为任务，所以我们已顾及到的是历史考古，少数民族及艺术工艺品三部门，参加的系别为历史、哲学、地质、社会、人类、国文、营建七系和图书馆。我们计划而未做的是与中国接壤诸国的文化交流遗迹和自然科学的公开展览。希望不久的将来，能举行大规模的特种展览，而在城中设立经常的陈列室，轮流展览，这是这次展览以后所接受到各方的要求。为充实材料起见，我们甚愿作旅行调查与搜集遗物的工作，尤盼望发展到边疆各地去。我们更盼望各方人士，兴起私藏归公的风气。此次展览时，我们也曾接受了一部分捐赠，一些热心的朋友们曾经答应我们将其收藏捐赠。我们认为特种展览非常重要，故盼望城中能有一个具备各项条件的近代化的陈列馆。
    以文物为供玩赏的古董，现少数民族为化外的野蛮番夷的时代业已过去。今后的新中国是要取鉴于历史的教训，根据时代的需要，发扬创造新文化；是要根据平等互助的原则，团结少数民族并发展它们的经济文化。凡此皆需彻底了解过去现在各民族社会所以形成的物质条件。因此文物的发掘与搜集是必要的。我们此次称高山族文物而不用“番品”等名称，是有深切意义的。我们尤当反省，自古以来的历朝文物乃许多人民心计劳力的具体创造，过去为王室贵族所专有，今当还之于人民，使他们借此等实物了解祖先辛苦的历史，从而享受祖先匠心所创造的艺术品。封建社会虽已成过去，然而对于封建社会下人民所创造的文物，应该表扬它、珍惜它、整理出来为人民所用。
