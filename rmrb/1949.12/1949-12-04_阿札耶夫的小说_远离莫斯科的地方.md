　　Azhayev's Novel "Far From Moscow"

　　The novel "Far From Moscow," which won the Stalin Prize last year, is the debut work of Azhayev, a young writer previously unknown. This novel was first serialized in the "New World" magazine and later published as a single volume. In just one year, the book was published in twenty-one editions, with over one million copies printed. He received countless letters from readers, including engineers, workers, students, drivers, teachers, librarians, soldiers, and officers, telling the author their thoughts after reading the novel. Almost unanimously, they believed that his book was not just a novel that gave them aesthetic satisfaction, but a masterpiece that deeply attracted, inspired, and ignited the flames of creative labor within them.

　　Vasily Nikolaevich Azhayev was born in 1915 into a craftsman's family. After finishing primary school, he worked and studied in a chemical factory in Moscow for several years. When he was twenty years old, he went to the Far East to participate in a massive railway construction project. In 1939, while working, Azhayev joined the correspondence department of the Gorky Literary Institute, sponsored by the Soviet Writers' Union, for study. He came to Moscow regularly to take exams, and after five years, he graduated. In 1946, he published the initial draft of this novel, and continued to revise and write it until finally, it was published in "New World" and received enthusiastic acclaim from readers.

　　The greatest success of this novel lies in its profound grasp of the spirit of the Soviet era, its vivid reproduction of socialist reality, and its widespread attention throughout the country. Like other successful Soviet literature, it was enthusiastically discussed at reader forums in cities and villages across the country. In several large industrial cities, city libraries launched city-wide reader conferences, inviting the author himself to speak. Similar meetings were also held in collective farms, factories, schools, and army clubs. The masses enthusiastically discussed the characters in the novel, who seemed like real people living among them. The novel describes the story of Soviet men and women workers building a pipeline in a "place far from Moscow," that is, the Far East. One reader, whose job was a driver, said: "I participated in the construction of this pipeline in 1943, and when I read Azhayev's book, I felt like I was meeting many of my friends again. How vividly he describes them!"

　　The protagonists in "Far From Moscow" are some talented engineers and organizers who lead this great project. They united a large group of working people, overcame all difficulties and obstacles with great confidence and perseverance, and completed a great undertaking. In a large factory in Moscow, when readers discussed this novel, they compared the factory director to the protagonist Batmanov in the novel, because their personalities and styles had significant similarities.

　　In the Soviet Union, the role of a novel has become increasingly important, and literature has become a necessary spiritual food for the people. The protagonists of novels often become heroes for people to emulate. The breadth of the impact of literary life is unprecedented. A Moscow university student wrote to the author:

　　"I have read your masterpiece, and I want to be as strong as Tanya Vasilchenko, as simple and sincere as Alexander Kovshov, as correct and capable as Beridze, as enthusiastic and powerful as the leader Batmanov, and as reasonable and tactful in dealing with all people as the Party organizer Mikhail Zhirkin."

　　The close relationship between a novelist and his readers could not be expressed more appropriately than this. The conditions of the Soviet state have created this possibility. This relationship between writers and readers enables readers to fully appreciate a work, without missing a single drop. We have produced great literature, and we also have great masses of readers.

### 阿札耶夫的小说　“远离莫斯科的地方”

　　阿札耶夫的小说 　“远离莫斯科的地方”
    去年获得斯大林奖金的小说“远离莫斯科的地方”是一位过去不为人所知的青年作家阿札耶夫的处女作。这部小说先在“新世界”杂志连载，后来印成单行本。仅仅在一年的过程中，这部书发行了二十一版，印数超过了一百万册。他得到了无数读者，包括工程师、工人、学生、司机、教员、图书馆员、士兵、军官们的来信，告诉作者他们对这小说的读后的感想。差不多一致地认为他的书不只是一本小说，使他们得到美学上的满足，而是一本深深地吸引他们，鼓舞他们，煽起创造性的劳动的火焰的杰作。
    瓦西里·尼古莱也维支·阿札耶夫生于一九一五年一个手艺匠之家。读完了初级学校后，他到莫斯科的化学工厂中去工作和学习了几年。在他二十岁的的时候，他跑到远东去参加巨大的铁路建设工程。在一九三九年时，阿札耶夫一边工作，一边加入苏联作家协会主办的高尔基文学院的函授部学习。他按期到莫斯科来参加考试，经过五年的功夫，他毕了业。在一九四六年他发表过这部小说的初稿，以后继续修加并写作，直到最后，发表在“新世界”上受到读者热烈的欢迎。
    这部小说的最大成功是在它深刻地把握了苏维埃的时代精神，生动地再现了社会主义的现实，引起了全国的广泛的注意。象其他苏联的成功的文学一样，它在各地的城市和乡村的读者讨论会上被热烈地讨论着。在好些工业中心的大城市中，由市图书馆发动了全城的读者大会，邀请作家本人莅临讲话。集体农场、工厂、学校、军队俱乐部中也举行了同样的会议。群众热烈地讨论小说中的角色，他们好象就是活在他们中间的真实人物。小说所描写的是在一个“远离莫斯科的地方”，就是远东，苏联的男女工人们建造一条油管的故事。有一个读者，他的工作是司机，就这样说：“我在一九四三年时参加过这条油管的建造工程，当我阅读阿札耶夫的书的时候，我仿佛重又遇到了我的许多朋友们，他描写得他们多么有声有色啊！”
    “远离莫斯科的地方”中的主角是一些领导这一伟大工程的有才能的工程师和组织者们，他们团结了一大群劳动人民，以极大的信心与毅力克服了一切困难和障碍，完成了一桩伟大的事业。在莫斯科的一个大工厂中，当读者们讨论这本小说时，他们就把本厂的厂长和小说中的主角巴特曼诺夫相比较，因为他们的性格和作风上都有着显著的相同点。
    在苏联，一本小说的作用已经越来越重要了，文学已经成为人民的必需的精神食粮。小说的主人公们常常成为人们模仿和效法的英雄。文学生活的影响的幅度是空前未有的。一个莫斯科的大学生写信给作者道：
    “我已经念了你的杰作，我愿意象塔尼亚·伐西尔钦可那样的坚强，象亚历山·柯夫萧夫那样的单纯和诚恳，象贝里特兹那样的正确和能干，象领导者巴特曼诺夫那样的热忱和有力，象党的组织者米海尔·柴尔金那样的合理而有策略地对待所有的人。”
    一个小说作者和他的读者之间的密切的关系是不能比这更能够适当地表现出来了。苏维埃国家的条件造成了这个可能性。这种作家与读者之间的关系，使读者能够充分地，一滴不遗留地，欣赏一个作品。我们产生了伟大的文学，我们也有了伟大的读者群众。
