    [This Newspaper] This newspaper's printing plant employees enthusiastically support the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee's decision regarding year-end double pay or bonuses, respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and launch a campaign to donate year-end bonuses. In the general meeting of employees yesterday (the 27th), everyone unanimously recognized that the war is still continuing, the national economy is facing difficulties, and rural areas are suffering from severe disasters. In order to support the front lines, carry the revolutionary war through to the end, quickly liberate all of China, and build a new China as soon as possible, the working class has a responsibility to help the government overcome difficulties and endure temporary hardships. Therefore, everyone is willing to dedicate their year-end bonuses to the country. At the meeting, typesetting worker Li Deqian said: "Since liberation, my life has been guaranteed and I have been living better than before. When the government is experiencing economic difficulties, I want to respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, willing to endure temporary pain, give up immediate benefits, and donate half a month's bonus to the country." Cui Yonglin said: "Before liberation, I was oppressed by the Kuomintang bandits and my life was not guaranteed; after liberation, I have not worried about food. I also support the government's decision and will not receive the year-end bonus." Binding worker Ning Xiaoxian wrote in a letter to the trade union: "These days, I have seen in the newspapers that workers all over the country are responding to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and I think, we shouldn't fall behind. In order to support the front lines and overcome difficulties, I don't want my half-month year-end bonus at all, and I will work actively and improve production." All the workers responded enthusiastically and unanimously agreed not to receive the year-end bonus.

　　本报印刷厂职工捐献年终奖金
    【本报讯】本报印刷厂职工热烈拥护中央人民政府财经委员会关于年终双薪或奖金的决定，响应中华全国总工会的号召，展开捐献年终奖金的活动。职工们昨（二十七）日全体大会讨论中，一致认识到战争还在继续，国家经济困难，农村灾荒严重，为了支援前线，把革命战争进行到底，迅速解放全中国，以及早日建设新中国，工人阶级有责任帮助政府克服困难，忍受暂时的艰苦，所以都愿意把年终奖金献给国家。在大会上，排字工人李德谦说：“自从解放以后，我的生活得到保障，过的比以前好了。在政府经济困难的时候，我要响应全国总工会的号召，愿意忍受一时的痛苦，放弃眼前的利益，把半月奖金通通捐给国家。”崔永林说：“解放以前受国民党匪帮的压迫，生活没有保障；解放后我就没有为吃发过愁，我也拥护政府的决定，不领年终奖金。”装订工人宁效贤在致工会的信中写道：“这几天，我从报纸上看到全国各地工友们都在响应全国总工会的号召，我就想，咱也不该落在人家后头。为了支援前线，克服困难，我的半月年奖全部不要，还要积极工作，搞好生产。”全体工友都纷纷响应，一致同意不领年终奖金。
