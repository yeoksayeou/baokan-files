Several Questions Regarding Amateur Remedial Schools
    Shu Ping
    Based on the experience of running amateur remedial schools in Shijiazhuang for nearly a year, we propose several questions in principle for research:
    (1) The Position of Remedial Education in Cities—With the rapid development of transforming consumer cities into production cities, many young industrial workers (with a junior high school diploma or higher), handicraft laborers, and ordinary citizens preparing to enter factories and engage in technical production are increasingly urgently and voluntarily demanding to learn. They want to raise their cultural, scientific, and political levels to the point where they can better master technology and engage in production. This situation is real. Therefore, the government should pay close attention to the education and training of the young generation of laborers, and young men and women, and teenagers should continue to learn without leaving production. To this end, it is very necessary and essential to open amateur schools on a large scale and to seriously engage in research on remedial education.
    (2) The Current Tasks and Policies of Remedial Education—Perhaps it should be viewed as follows: The current task is to prepare young workers and handicraft laborers, as well as young citizens with low levels of education, to be trained in the future into middle and lower-level, and even advanced, construction talents who can engage in production for the construction of a new democratic society. At the same time, it is necessary to educate them to have a deep understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and love and care for their motherland. Therefore, the specific policy is: amateur remedial schools should become a reserve force for cultivating students for vocational and technical schools, and a transitional educational stage for ordinary citizens in preparation for professional training. At the same time, the school also becomes a place for these young people to study politics.
    (3) How to Standardize Amateur Remedial Education—Therefore, amateur remedial education must be standardized. Standardization needs to solve the following problems: (A) Centralized leadership and decentralized learning; (B) School equipment and fundraising; (C) Allocation of excellent teachers and administrative talents; (D) Setting up systems and compiling and compressing teaching materials. In addition, it should be noted that the mobility of students in remedial schools, while we cannot completely standardize it, is also because we have not fully standardized it as much as possible, so we cannot stabilize the mobility of students. Generally speaking, the standardization of amateur remedial education is quite possible.
    (4) The School System of Amateur Remedial Schools—A dual-track school system should be avoided, and a unified school system should be strived for. The goal is to give vocational youth the opportunity to receive higher education. The Soviet Union implements a single-track education system. In "Thirty Years of Education in the Soviet Union" (written by Kalashnikov, translated by Liao Yi), it says: "In schools for worker-peasant youth (note: that is, a kind of amateur remedial school), the amount of general education knowledge that students receive is as much as they receive in ordinary middle schools. The rights obtained by students who graduate from these schools are the same as the rights obtained by students who graduate from seven-year middle schools and middle schools." It also says: "These schools have helped to raise the level of the working class to the level of technical labor workers, and have created a large number of reserve personnel for technical specialized schools and higher schools." Although our school system has not yet been clearly defined, we can refer to this spirit of the Soviet Union.

　　关于业余补习学校的几个问题
    舒平
    根据石家庄将近一年来的业余补习学校工作经验，我们原则地提出几个问题，以供研究：
    （一）补习教育在城市中所占的位置问题——随着将消费城市变成生产城市之快速的发展，许多青年产业工人（具有高小毕业以上程度者）和手工业劳动者，以及准备走入工厂，从事技术生产的普通市民，都日益迫切地、自动地起来要求学习。要求将文化、科学和政治水平，提高到为准备能更好地掌握技术，从事生产的程度。这种情况是实在的。因此，政府应非常注意劳动青年一代的教育与培养，男女青年和少年，应在不脱离生产的条件下，继续学习。为此目的，大规模地开办业余学校和认真地从事补习教育的研究，是非常必要而且必需的。
    （二）补习教育的目前任务与方针问题——也许应该这样看：目前任务是准备将文化程度低的青年工人和手工业劳动者，以及青年市民，提高到将来培养成能为建设新民主主义社会的从事生产的中下级，甚至高级的建设人才。同时，教育他（她）们对中国共产党的深刻认识和对自己祖国的热爱及关怀。因此，具体方针：业余补习学校，即成为培养职业技术学校学员的后备力量，和普通市民为准备从事专业训练的过渡教育阶段。同时，学校也成为这些青年们的政治学习场所。
    （三）业余补习如何正规化的问题——因此，业余补习必须正规化。正规化须要解决以下几个问题：（甲）集中领导与分散学习问题；（乙）学校设备与经费筹措问题；（丙）优良教师与行政人材的配备问题；（丁）订定制度及教材编选压缩问题。此外，应该注意到，使补校学生的流动性，固然我们不容易完全正规化，但也因为我们没有完全尽可能地正规化，所以不能稳定学生们的流动。一般说来，业余补习的正规化，是相当可能的。
    （四）业余补习学校的学制问题——应该避免学制的双轨化，力求学制的一元化。目的在使职业青年，亦有受高等教育的机会。苏联是实行教育的单轨制的，在“苏联三十年来的教育”（卡拉什尼克夫著，辽逸译）上说：“在工农青年学校（按：即一种业余的补习学校）中，学生所受到的普通教育的知识分量，是和平常的中学中所受到的一样多。在这些学校毕业的学生所得的权利，是和七年制中学和中学毕业的学生所得到的权利是一样的。”又说：“这些学校帮助了把工人阶级的水准提高到技术劳动工作者的水准，为技术专门学校和高级学校，造就了大量的后备人员。”我们的学制，虽然目前还没有明确定出来，但是可以参考苏联这种精神的。
