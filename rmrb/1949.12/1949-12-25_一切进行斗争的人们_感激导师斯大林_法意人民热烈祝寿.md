　　　　　France
    French working people and all progressive individuals warmly celebrated the great Stalin's 70th birthday. Mass rallies were held in many cities and towns in France. Thousands of working people in Paris participated in the celebration meeting held on the 21st at the "Mutual Aid" Hall. The rostrum was decorated with red cloth bearing the golden words, "Glory to the Leader of the International Workers' Movement!" The meeting opened with the sounds of the Soviet national anthem and the Marseillaise, accompanied by enormous cheers congratulating Stalin, and was presided over by Cachin. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez, in a moving speech, expressed the French people's boundless affection for their beloved leader, mentor, and friend, as well as the firm determination of the French working people to actively fight for peace and democracy and against instigators of new wars. Thorez said: "All working people, suffering people, hopeful people, people engaged in struggle, unanimously express their gratitude to their leader, their mentor, their guide – Comrade Stalin. Glory to the leader of the international proletariat, the leader of the socialist revolution, the liberator of all nationalities, the number one fighter for freedom and peace! May our friend, the great Stalin, be in good health and live a long life! Long live Communism!" The thousands of attendees all rose to their feet and responded with prolonged applause and cheers.

    　　　　Italy
    The Italian General Confederation of Labor, representing five million members, sent a telegram to Stalin on the 21st, stating: "While celebrating your birthday with workers all over the world, we reiterate the solemn assurance of Italian workers: to fight against all war dangers and to struggle for the liberation of all people still oppressed under the shackles of capitalism." The Italian Women's League, with 1,020,000 members, also sent a telegram to Stalin to congratulate him on his birthday. Socialist Party leader Nenni, in the name of the party, sent a telegram to the Soviet ambassador in Rome, requesting him to convey the congratulations of the Italian Socialists to Stalin: wishing him "longevity and health, and new victories in building the edifice of socialism and consolidating the cause of peace." The Italian National Association of Partisans, Communist members of parliament in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, and the editorial staff of "Unità" in Rome, Milan, Turin, and Genoa, all sent congratulatory telegrams to Stalin. The editor-in-chief of the Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti!", Pettini, also sent a telegram to Stalin on behalf of the entire staff of the newspaper to congratulate him. The exhibition of birthday gifts from the Italian people to Stalin has already opened, and the opening ceremony was attended by Longo, deputy secretary-general of the Italian Communist Party, and others. Among them was the work of famous painter Guttuso: "Episode of Peasants' Struggle," depicting five Italian peasants singing loudly while being arrested during a farmhand strike. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" published a special birthday issue on the 21st, with two million Communist Party members pledging to "bring the special issue to every family in Italy."
