Comrades:
　　The twenty-first is the seventieth birthday of Comrade Stalin.

　　As everyone knows, Stalin is the successor and developer of the cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, one of the founders of Marxism-Leninism. He was Lenin's closest comrade-in-arms. Together with Lenin, he founded, consolidated, and cultivated the new type of proletarian party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and founded the first socialist country in human history—the Soviet Union. Moreover, Stalin was the builder and leader of this socialist country. He led the implementation of the New Economic Policy, enabling the Soviet Union to overcome the difficulties in the early stages of construction, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and achieving a high degree of socialist industrialization in several five-year plans.

　　This fact has taught the people of the world that to have peace, democracy, and a good life, they must wage a resolute and merciless struggle against imperialism, and in this struggle, the people are bound to win final victory. The Soviet Union is a great example of victory. This has encouraged the struggle of the proletariat and peace-loving people around the world against imperialism, strengthening their confidence in victory.

　　Stalin is not only an encourager and leader of the anti-imperialist struggle of the proletariat and people of the world, but also the most authoritative and loyal defender of world peace. Stalin led the anti-fascist Second World War, defeated German, Italian, and Japanese imperialism, and steadfastly implemented a policy of maintaining peace after the war, combating the warmongering of the British and American imperialists and their propaganda schemes. Under his leadership, the strength of the world peace and democracy camp has grown stronger day by day.

　　Because the Soviet Union is China's neighbor, Stalin's influence on China is even greater.

　　Stalin theoretically armed the Chinese working class and the people. In 1927, Stalin told us: "The Chinese revolution is the confluence of two torrents of revolutionary movements—the revolutionary movement against feudal remnants and the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement," "The Chinese revolution is a bourgeois-democratic revolution and a national liberation revolution at the same time," "The characteristic and advantage of the Chinese revolution is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." With Stalin's wise instructions and Chairman Mao's correct leadership, we have today's powerful united front, the powerful People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese Communist Party, unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, and we have achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution!

　　The Soviet Union, led by Stalin, also helped the Chinese people materially. As early as the Great Revolution in 1925, the Soviet Union sent many comrades to China to specifically help the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, achieving the great victory in the early stage of the Great Revolution. In the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union helped the Chinese people resist the Japanese aggressors with military and economic aid. During the Second World War, the Soviet Union, regardless of all sacrifices, quickly liberated the Northeast, and finally defeated Japanese imperialism. In the recent years of the People's Liberation War, the Soviet Union and the Eastern European New Democratic countries, led by Stalin, contained the main forces of imperialism, gave us unlimited spiritual support, so that people's revolution was not isolated, and finally achieved victory!

　　Comrades, the Chinese and Soviet people have always had a deep friendship, but when China was under the rule of reactionary forces, the development of this friendship was restricted and obstructed. Only now, after the victory of the Chinese people's revolution has broken through the eastern front of imperialism and established the People's Republic of China, can this friendship be developed infinitely. Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union and his meeting with Stalin is a symbol of the great future of Sino-Soviet friendship, and it is also a symbol of the great victory of the people of the world in the anti-imperialist struggle!

　　Comrades, thanks to Stalin and the socialist Soviet Union, our revolution was able to succeed. Now that we are beginning the work of building a new China, we must also learn from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building.

　　Comrade Stalin said that to ensure industrial development, it is necessary to improve the cultural and technical level of the working class, break the old technical norms, the old production plans, and formulate new technical norms and new higher production plans to increase the wealth of the entire society. It is also necessary to implement and consolidate economic accounting, increase the accumulation of funds within the industry; in addition, it is necessary to correctly determine workers' wages and improve workers' living conditions.

　　Stalin's words to the Soviet working class also apply to our construction work today.

　　Comrades, Stalin also said that a good country cannot be built without building a good capital. Today, when we Beijing workers are shouldering the responsibility of building the capital of new China, we are celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday. I believe that only by doing a better job in production and building the capital of new China better can we offer our most respectful congratulations to Comrade Stalin on his 70th birthday!

　　Comrades, our Chinese revolution has achieved a great victory. After a long period of bloody struggle and with the assistance of the international working class led by the Soviet Union, our working class has transformed from an oppressed slave status to become the masters of the country, the leading class of the New Democratic New China. We workers already have all democratic, free, and political rights, but the war throughout the country has not ended, and the construction work is just beginning. This has increased the difficulties we face in victory. First of all, it has increased the various expenses of the country, causing the country's finances to be unsustainable. Therefore, the question now facing us workers and the people of the whole country is: how to overcome this difficulty, support the front lines, strive for the complete liberation of the whole of China, and build our own democratic and happy country. To achieve this goal, we can only rely on our working class to unite the people of the whole country, endure temporary difficulties, and help the country overcome its current financial difficulties and all the difficulties encountered in victory by enduring hardship, working more, living frugally, and actively producing and working!

　　In order to celebrate Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, in order to build the capital of new China, and to build our strong New Democratic New China, workers of Beijing, I call on you:

　　First, we must live frugally, endure temporary difficulties, and reduce the country's financial and economic expenditures. First of all, our capital workers must take the lead in supporting and implementing the "Measures for Handling the Issue of Year-End Double Salaries or Bonuses for Certain Factories" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee, because although the Chinese revolution has basically achieved national victory, next year will still be a difficult year. The people of the whole country, especially our workers, have a greater obligation and responsibility to overcome this difficulty. The notice issued by the Financial and Economic Committee is based on the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, taking into account the country's financial difficulties on the one hand, and the workers' economic interests on the other. Therefore, the measures mentioned in this notice are the most reasonable, appropriate, and in line with the long-term interests of our workers. Everyone should carefully discuss and study this notice and the letter to workers issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on this issue, and negotiate specific measures with the factory administration based on the specific conditions of each factory. As for private enterprises, they should also, through the trade union, negotiate with the capitalists based on the specific profit and loss situation of each enterprise, in accordance with the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. In addition, it is hoped that our capital workers will actively purchase public bonds, strive to stabilize prices in the face of the country's financial and economic difficulties, making it more conducive to restoring and developing production, and making our workers' lives more secure, so that those who are employed will not lose their jobs, and those who are unemployed will find it easier to be re-employed. In short, our working class should play a leading role in all aspects of building a new country and become a leading class in the true sense of the word.

　　Second, we must develop production and increase national income. We workers must study hard, improve our skills, launch enthusiastic and widespread production competitions and new record-breaking movements, and, in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions, constantly break the old technical norms and the old production norms, and demand the formulation of new technical norms and new higher production plans. We must learn from the outstanding heroes of the Soviet working class—Stakhanov workers—everyone should use their brains, think of more ways, transform tools, or suggest to the administrative side to correctly reorganize the labor force, eliminate unreasonable and wasteful phenomena in production, so that our production volume can be greatly improved. At present, some of the state-owned enterprises and factories in this city have transformed their trade unions, and some are being re-elected. At the same time, more and more municipal trade unions or municipal trade union preparatory committees have been established in private industries. It is hoped that in the future, the trade union organizations will be strengthened and consolidated, and all workers will strive for greater victories on the production front in 1950 under the leadership of a strong trade union, laying a solid foundation for the country's financial and economic foundation, so that our country can overcome its current difficulties and smoothly build a New Democratic country, and build Beijing into a true capital of a New Democratic New China.

　　Comrades, I believe that it is most meaningful for us Beijing workers to celebrate Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday with the above two practical actions.

　　Comrades, let us finally shout:

　　Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, may his life be as long as the Southern Mountain!

　　我们北京工人应该怎样庆祝斯大林七十寿辰
    北京市总工会筹委会主任肖明二十日在北京市人民广播电台讲演词同志们：
    二十一日是斯大林同志的七十寿辰。
    大家都知道，斯大林是马恩列事业的继承者、发扬者，是马列主义学说的奠基人之一，他是列宁最亲密的战友，他同列宁在一起，创立、巩固、培植了无产阶级新型政党苏联共产党，创立了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家——苏联，而且，斯大林还是这个社会主义国家的建设者，领导者，他领导实行了新经济政策，使苏联克服了建设初期的困难，巩固了工农联盟，几个五年计划中达到高度的社会主义工业化。
    这个事实，教育了全世界的人民，要和平，要民主，要生活过得好，必须同帝国主义作坚决的无情的斗争，而且在这个斗争中，人民是一定取得最后胜利的，苏联就是一个伟大的胜利的榜样，这样就鼓舞了全世界无产阶级和爱好和平的人民反帝国主义的斗争，加强了他们的胜利信心。
    斯大林不仅是全世界无产阶级与人民反帝国主义斗争的鼓舞者和领导者，并且还是世界和平的最有威权的忠实保卫者。斯大林领导了反法西斯的第二次世界大战，打败了德意日帝国主义，并且还坚定地在战后执行维护和平的政策，打击了英美战争贩子及其阴谋宣传，而在他的领导下，现在世界和平民主阵营的力量已经一天比一天强大了。
    由于苏联是中国的近邻，所以斯大林对中国的影响就更大了。
    斯大林在理论上武装了中国工人阶级与人民，斯大林在一九二七年就告诉我们：“中国革命是两支革命运动的巨流——反封建残余的革命运动和反帝国主义的革命运动之汇合”，“中国革命是资产阶级民主革命，同时又是民族解放革命”，“中国革命的特点和优点是武装的革命反对武装的反革命”，有了斯大林的英明指示，又有了毛主席的正确领导，我们才有了今天强大的统一战线，强大的人民解放军，和全国人民一致拥护的中国共产党，才取得了中国革命的胜利！
    以斯大林为领导的苏联，还在物质上帮助了中国人民，远在一九二五年大革命时期，苏联就派了许多同志到中国来具体帮助中国人民革命事业，取得了大革命初期的伟大胜利；在抗日战争初期，苏联曾在军事上经济上帮助中国人民抵抗日本侵略者的进攻；第二次世界大战中，苏联又不顾一切牺牲，迅速地解放了东北，最后地打败了日帝国主义；在最近几年人民解放战争中，以斯大林为领导的苏联和东欧各新民主国家，牵制了帝国主义的主要力量，给了我们精神上以无限的支援，使人们的革命一直不是孤立的，并终于得到了胜利！
    同志们，中苏人民一向是有着深厚的友谊的，但当中国处在反动势力统治下的时候，这种友谊的发展是被限制和阻挠的，只有在现在，中国人民革命胜利地冲破了帝国主义东方战线，建立了中华人民共和国，这种友谊才得到无限的发展，毛主席这次访问苏联，会见了斯大林，这就是中苏友谊伟大前途的象征，这也就是全世界人民反帝国主义斗争伟大胜利的象征！
    同志们，由于有了斯大林，有了社会主义苏联，我们的革命才能胜利，现在我们要开始建设新中国的工作，我们还必须学习苏联建国的经验。
    斯大林同志说要保证工业发展，就要提高工人阶级文化技术水平，打破旧的技术定额，旧的生产计划，规定新的技术定额，新的更高的生产计划，以增加整个社会的财富；并且要施行并巩固经济核算制，提高工业内部资金的积累；此外，还要正确规定工人工资，改善工人生活条件。
    斯大林对苏联工人阶级说的话，也同样适用于我们今天的建设工作。
    同志们，斯大林还说过，不能建设一个好的首都，便不能建设一个好的国家。在今天，我们北京工人担负起建设新中国首都的责任的时候，我们来庆祝斯大林七十大寿，我认为只有更好的生产工作，把新中国的首都建设得更好，才能作为我们对斯大林同志七十大寿最尊敬的祝贺！
    同志们，我们中国革命已获得了伟大的胜利，我们工人阶级经过长期流血斗争和以苏联为首的国际工人阶级的援助，已经从被压迫的奴隶地位，变成国家的主人、新民主主义新中国的领导阶级，我们工人已有了一切民主、自由和政治上的权利，但是全国范围内的战争尚未结束，建设工作方在开始，这就增加了我们在胜利中的困难，首先是增加了国家的各种经费开支，使国家财政入不敷出，所以现在摆在我们工人和全国人民面前的问题，就是：如何克这个困难，支援前线，争取全中国的彻底解放，建设起我们自己的民主幸福的国家。为要达到这个目的，就只有依靠我们工人阶级团结全国人民，忍受暂时的困难，以吃得苦、做得多、节衣缩食、积极生产与工作来帮助国家渡过目前的财政困难和胜利中所遇到的一切困难！
    为了庆贺斯大林同志七十大寿，为了建设新中国的首都，以及建设我们强大的新民主主义的新中国，北京市的工人同志们，我号召你们：
    第一、要节衣缩食，忍受暂时的困难，减轻国家财政经济开支。首先，我们首都工人要带头拥护执行财政经济委员会所发表的“关于某些工厂年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法”，因为中国革命虽然基本上已取得全国胜利，但明年仍将是困难的一年，全国人民，尤其是我们工人，更有克服这种困难的义务与责任，财政经济委员会所发表的这个通告，是根据公私兼顾的原则，一方面照顾了国家财政困难，另一方面照顾了工人的经济利益，所以这通告上所提的办法是最合理、最恰当、最合乎我们工人长远利益的办法，大家应该好好讨论，研究这个通告及全国总工会关于这个问题所发表的告工人书，按各厂具体情况，与工厂笔政协商出具体办法。至于私营企业，也应该经过工会，根据各企业盈亏的具体情况，本着发展生产劳资两利的政策，与资方协商解决。此外，并且希望我们首都工人踊跃购买公债，在国家财政经济困难的情形下争取稳定物价，使得更有利于恢复与发展生产，使得我们工人的生活更有保障，在业的不会失业，失业的更容易得到复业。总之，我们工人阶级在建设新国家各种事业中都应当起带头作用，做到一个名符其实的领导阶级。
    第二、要发展生产，增加国家收入。我们工人要努力学习，提高技术，发动热烈的广泛的生产竞赛和创造新纪录运动，按着斯大林同志的指示，不断地打破旧的技术定额，旧的生产定额，而要求规定新的技术定额，新的更高的生产计划，我们要向苏联工人阶级优秀的英雄们——斯远哈诺夫工作者学习，每个人都开动脑筋，多想办法，改造工具，或者向行政方面建议正确地重新组织劳动力，消灭生产中不合理与浪费的现象，使得我们的生产量大大提高，目前本市公营企业工厂有一部分已经改造了工会，有一部分正在改选，同时，私营行业中也更多地成立了市工会或市工会筹委会，希望今后要加强和巩固工会组织，全体工人要在强有力的工会领导下，争取一九五○年生产战线上更大的胜利，打下国家财政经济的雄厚基础，使我们的国家能克服目前的困难，顺利地建设成一个新民主主义的国家，使北京市建设成一个真正的新民主主义新中国的首都。
    同志们，我认为我们北京工人只有用以上两点实际行动庆贺斯大林同志七十寿辰，才是最有意义的。
    同志们，最后让我们高呼：
    中苏友好万岁！
    斯大林大元帅寿比南山万岁！
