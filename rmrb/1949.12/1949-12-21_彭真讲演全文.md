[Beijing News] The full text of the speech by Peng Zhen, President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, at the celebration of Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday:

　　Today we celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, and we joyfully wish him longevity and long life!

　　There are so many seventy-year-olds, Chinese and foreign, so why do we especially celebrate Stalin's birthday? Because the name Stalin is inseparable from the interests and liberation of the Chinese people, and from the interests and liberation of the people of the world. He is the best friend and mentor of the Chinese people and the people of the world. His longevity is the greatest benefit and happiness for the Chinese and world people. Therefore, we wish him longevity and long life!

　　For the past century, China has suffered from internal troubles and external invasions, and deep disasters. In order to strive for its own liberation, the Chinese people have continuously carried out heroic struggles, time and time again, countless martyrs shed their blood, but until the October Revolution, they could not achieve a decisive victory. The October Revolution introduced Marxism-Leninism to China. The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and led the Chinese people to achieve today's victory.

　　But may I ask, without the help of Stalin's theory and cause to China, could the Chinese people have achieved today's victory? We can definitely say no.

　　First, let us talk about the theoretical guidance: Everyone knows that without the Communist Party, there would be no present-day China, and the Chinese Communist Party was established in accordance with the party-building principles of the Soviet Communist Party led by Lenin and Stalin; that is to say, without Lenin and Stalin, without the Soviet Bolsheviks, there would be no present-day Chinese Communist Party.

　　"In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." This is the brilliant instruction given by Stalin to the revolutionary people of China. Chairman Mao precisely adhered to, promoted, and developed this theory, led and established the Chinese People's Liberation Army, created and continuously expanded the revolutionary base areas, and finally eliminated the powerful enemy, enabling the Chinese people to achieve victory.

　　The third magic weapon for the Chinese people to achieve victory is the united front. Stalin's theory also gives us brilliant guidance here. He taught us to "be good at finding allies for ourselves." Chairman Mao led the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people in this way, established a broad united front with the Chinese working class as the leading backbone, and established the people's own joint government and the People's Republic of China.

　　Without the theoretical guidance given by Stalin, it would have been impossible for the Chinese people to achieve such a victory today.

　　Secondly, let us talk about the help that the cause of Lenin and Stalin has given to the Chinese people.

　　The great October Revolution overthrew one of the most ferocious enemies of the Chinese people, Tsarist Russia, namely Russian imperialism, and abolished all unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia. During the Second World War, Stalin again led the Soviet people and the people of the world to overthrow the three powerful imperialist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, which oppressed the Chinese people. In the three-year Liberation War, although American imperialism had become the main enemy of the Chinese people, and although American imperialism has not yet been defeated, it is also because of the great socialist Soviet Union and the new democratic countries that American imperialism has become a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality, and the Chinese People's Liberation War was able to achieve such a great victory so quickly. World peace and democratic cause have gained such guarantees today. As for the manpower and material assistance that the Soviet Union gave to China during the Great Revolution and the Anti-Japanese War, it is a well-known fact and need not be mentioned.

　　Comrades, such a mentor and friend as Stalin, such a great mentor and friend who has given us such great help, only the enemies of the people and those who do not understand the general trend of the world are unwilling to celebrate his birthday. We, the Chinese people, sincerely celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, wish him longevity and long life!

　　How should the people of Beijing celebrate Stalin's birthday? We must learn from Stalin, learn from the Soviet Union's resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit, continue to eliminate the remaining hidden enemies in Beijing, learn from their spirit of frugality and overcoming difficulties to complete the Five-Year Plan one by one, to restore and develop Beijing's production and cultural and educational undertakings, and further build Beijing's people's democratic regime and build the people's capital. This is how we should celebrate Stalin's birthday.

　　Long live Stalin!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　彭真讲演全文
    【北京讯】北京市中苏友好协会会长彭真在庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰大会中的讲话，全文如下：
    今天我们庆祝斯大林七十大寿，我们欢欣鼓舞地祝他万寿无疆，祝他万岁！
    中国人，外国人，七十岁的人那样多，为什么特别要给斯大林祝寿呢？因为斯大林三个字与中国人民的利益和解放，与世界人民的利益和解放是分不开的，他是中国人民和世界人民最好的朋友和导师，他的长寿乃是中国和世界人民莫大的利益和幸福，因此我们祝他万寿无疆，祝他万岁！
    中国近百年来内优外患，灾难深重，为了争取自己的解放，中国人民不断地进行了英勇斗争，一次又一次的，无数先烈流了他们的鲜血，但是直到十月革命为止，总不能得到决定性的胜利。十月革命把马列主义介绍给中国，中国共产党和毛主席把马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践结合起来，并领导了中国人民取得了今天的胜利。
    可是请问，如果没有斯大林的理论和事业对中国的帮助，中国人民能不能得到今天的胜利呢？我们可以肯定的说，不能够。
    首先我们从理论指导方面讲：大家知道没有共产党就没有现在的中国，而中国共产党就是按照列宁、斯大林领导的苏联共产党的建党原则建立起来的；就是说没有列宁、斯大林，没有苏联布尔什维克，就没有今天的中国共产党。
    “在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。”这是斯大林给予中国革命人民的辉煌指示，毛主席正是坚持并且发扬、发展了这一理论，领导与建立了中国人民解放军，创造并不断扩大了革命根据地，最后才消灭了强大的敌人，使中国人民获得了胜利。
    中国人民所以能取得胜利的第三个法宝是统一战线，斯大林的理论，在这里也同样给予我们光辉的指示，他教导我们“要善于给自己找寻同盟者”，毛主席正是这样领导中国共产党和中国人民，建立了以中国工人阶级为领导骨干的广泛统一战线，并建立了人民自己的联合政府，建立了中华人民共和国。
    中国人民如果没有斯大林所给予的理论指示是不可能取得今天这样胜利的。
    其次，我们再就列宁、斯大林的事业所给予中国人民的帮助来说。
    伟大的十月革命，打倒了中国人民最凶狠的敌人之一的沙俄，即俄国帝国主义，废除帝俄所订的对华一切不平等条约。第二次世界大战中斯大林又领导苏联人民与世界人民打倒了压迫中国人民的德、意、日三个强大的帝国主义国家。在三年解放战争中，虽然美帝国主义已经成为中国人民的主要敌人，虽然美帝国主义到现在还没有被打倒，但也因为有了伟大的社会主义苏联和各新民主国家，美国帝国主义才成外强中干的纸老虎，中国人民解放战争也才有可能这样迅速地获得这样伟大的胜利。世界和平、民主事业才获得今天这样的保障。至于在大革命时期和抗日战争时期，苏联所给予中国的人力的和物力的援助，乃是人所共知的事实，更不消说了。
    同志们，象斯大林这样一个导师和朋友，象斯大林这样一个给予我们这样大的帮助的伟大的导师和朋友，只有人民的敌人和不了解世界大势的人，才不愿为他祝寿，我们中国人民是衷心的庆祝斯大林的七十寿辰，祝他万寿无疆，祝他万岁的。
    我们北京市人民怎样来庆祝斯大林的寿辰呢？我们要学习斯大林，学习苏联的坚决彻底的革命精神，继续肃清北京市残余潜伏的敌人，学习他们节衣缩食克服困艰，一个一个的完成五年计划的精神，来恢复与发展北京市的生产事业和文化教育事业，并进一步地建设北京市的人民民主的政权，建设人民的首都。我们要这样来为斯大林祝寿。
    斯大林万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中苏友好万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
