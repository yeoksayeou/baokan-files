　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and Director of the Middle East Department, McGhee, convened a meeting of U.S. diplomatic personnel from eleven Middle Eastern countries in Istanbul, Turkey, on the 26th of last month, which concluded on the 29th. The main purpose of this meeting was to discuss concrete steps for the United States to rapidly transform Middle Eastern countries into American strategic bases under the "Military Assistance Act." According to a report by the Associated Press, the main agenda of this meeting included "plans to assist Iran, Turkey, and Greece," "strategies to counter communist infiltration into this strategic region," and "the implementation of Truman's Point Four Program," etc. Reuters quoted comments from Egyptian newspapers as saying: "The United States suggests that Arab countries reach a permanent peaceful settlement with Israel as a prerequisite for stability in the Middle East, and asks them to support the proposed Arab collective security pact as a foothold against communism." This meeting of American diplomatic personnel in the Middle East, coming right after the meeting of the "Arab League" council in Cairo, supported by Britain, naturally leads one to associate it with the fact that American imperialism is actively squeezing out the influence of British imperialism in the Middle East.

    议讨论变中东为基地积极排挤英帝势力
    【新华社北京二日电】美国助理国务卿兼中东司司长麦克琪，于上月二十六日在土耳其的伊斯坦堡召集了美国驻中东十一国的外交人员举行会议，并已于二十九日结束。这次会议主要为讨论美国使中东各国在“军事援助法案”下迅速变成美国战略基地的具体步骤。据合众社报道，这次会议的主要议程为“援助伊朗、土耳其和希腊的计划”“对共产党渗入该战略地区的策略”和“杜鲁门第四点计划的实施”等。路透社引埃及报纸的评论说：“美国建议阿拉伯国家与以色列达成永久的和平解决，作为中东安定的先决条件，并请他们支持拟议中的阿拉伯集体安全公约，作为反对共产主义的立足点。”中东美国外交人员的这次会议，恰在为英国支持的“阿拉伯联盟”的理事会在开罗举行会议之后，使人自然而然地联想到美帝国主义正在中东积极地排挤英帝国主义的势力。
