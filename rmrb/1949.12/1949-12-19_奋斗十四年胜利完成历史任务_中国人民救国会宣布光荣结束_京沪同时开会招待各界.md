　　Striving for Fourteen Years and Successfully Completing the Historical Mission
  　The China National Salvation Association Announces its Glorious End
    Simultaneous Meetings Held in Beijing and Shanghai to Entertain People from All Walks of Life
    The China National Salvation Association, on the occasion of the fourteenth anniversary of its founding today, announced its glorious end. This afternoon, the Association held a tea party to entertain members in Beijing and people from various democratic parties, and issued a declaration of termination. Present were Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Lin Boqu, Zhou Enlai, He Xiangning, Zhang Bojun, Ma Xulun, Cai Tingkai, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Sha Qianli, Zhang Youyu, Liu @, Li Geng, Wu Yuheng, Xu Xuehan, Han Youtong, Xue Muqiao, Luo Qiong, Sun Qimeng, Zhang Zhirang, Zhou Xinmin, Huang Luofeng, and others, totaling one hundred and eight people. The tea party was presided over by Chairman Shen Junru. At the beginning, the entire audience stood up and observed a moment of silence for the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the National Salvation Movement. In his speech, Shen Junru said: "The China National Salvation Association will announce its end to the people of the whole country from today. This matter was proposed last September when we went to Harbin, and it has been brewing for a year. Now, members from the central to local levels have unanimously agreed. Our comrades of the National Salvation Association believe that everything is determined by the times, and we must first understand the times. Today, the People's Republic of China has been established. This makes us realize that with the Common Program passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the guiding principle, and with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, China can move steadily and worry-free on the road from New Democracy to Socialism and Communism. Our comrades of the National Salvation Association have thoroughly recognized this point and believed in this point. Therefore, today, we resolutely and happily announce the end of our historical mission in front of everyone. From now on, the National Salvation Association will no longer exist. Our comrades of the National Salvation Association are willing to closely follow the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, serve the people, and actively strive for the construction of a new China." Next, Hu Yuzhi reported on the process of the ending and announced that the Association had elected Shen Junru, Shi Liang, Sha Qianli, Shen Zhiyuan, Qian Jiaju, Hu Yuzhi, Sa Kongliao, Cao Mengjun, and Wang Jian nine people to form a memorial committee to handle the permanent memorial affairs of Zou Taofen, Tao Xingzhi, Li Gongpu, Du Chongyuan, and other martyrs who sacrificed in the National Salvation Movement. In addition, he also announced the letter of respect from the comrades of the People's National Salvation Association to Chairman Mao.
    Subsequently, Zhang Lan, Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Ma Xulun, Zhang Bojun, and Zhang Naiqi delivered speeches, unanimously praising the arduous struggle and brilliant achievements of the People's Salvation for the cause of the Chinese revolution, as well as the determination of the comrades of the National Salvation Association to actively strive for the construction of a new China in the future. Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at about 4 o'clock to participate and gave a speech that lasted more than an hour, receiving warm applause from the audience.
    Finally, after the chairman delivered a thank-you speech, he read out the congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin on his 70th birthday. All stood up and shouted: "Long live Marshal Stalin!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!"
    The last grand meeting of the China National Salvation Association, which has a glorious revolutionary history of fourteen years, ended at 6 pm in a warm atmosphere.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 18th: The Shanghai Branch of the China National Salvation Association held a meeting this morning to entertain people from all walks of life and announce the end of the Association.
