　　[Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Guangdong Province, in coordination with the剿匪troops of the Southern Hunan PLA and the local armed forces of the Northern Guangdong District, actively suppressed the remaining bandits in the border area between Hunan and Guangdong. From the 8th to the 16th, in nine days, they successively captured the four county towns of Lianxian, Lianshan, Liannan, and Yangshan in northern Guangdong, eliminating and capturing more than two thousand remaining bandits. The Northern Route剿匪troops of the People's Liberation Army first captured the remaining bandit strongholds of Xingzi, Xincun, and Meijia on the periphery of Lianxian on the 7th, capturing alive Shen Xuezhong, the colonel-level deputy captain and director of the political work office of the bandit Transportation Police Corps, and more than 300 others. Subsequently, they liberated the towns of Lianxian, Lianshan, Liannan, and Sanjiang, capturing more than 1,100 bandits and seizing six light and heavy machine guns, 910 long and short guns, and two radio stations. On the 13th, the People's Liberation Army fiercely attacked the bandit "Guangdong Anti-Communist Self-Defense Ninth Army" near Libu, capturing more than 250 officers and soldiers, including the chief of staff of the 26th Division of the bandits; the remaining bandits fled into the ＠shan Mountain area. The People's Liberation Army, regardless of fatigue, tracked and pursued them into the deep mountains, and by the 16th, they captured in the mountain area the bandit leader Li Chuying, commander of the "Guangdong Anti-Communist Self-Defense Ninth Army," commander of the 26th Division, commissioner of the Fifth District of Guangdong, and security commander, as well as Yu Jizu, the bandit deputy security commander and chief of staff of the Ninth Army, and 49 other officers and soldiers, seizing four light machine guns. The Southern Route剿匪troops liberated Yangshan on the 14th, eliminating more than a hundred bandits. The 剿匪troops of the People's Liberation Army on this route joined forces with the Northern Route剿匪troops in Libu on the 16th. Under the relentless pursuit and fierce attack of the People's Liberation Army, the remaining bandits who escaped the net also surrendered to the People's Liberation Army one after another. From the 10th to the 13th, in four days, four shares of remaining bandits, including Zhang Long, the captain of the Yingde County bandits, totaling 446 people, came to surrender with their weapons.
