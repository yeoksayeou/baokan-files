　　　　Criminal Facts

　　The following defendants, Sasaki Hirotsune et al., served as American spies, stealing our military and political secrets and endangering our liberated areas and the cause of the people's revolution. After investigation by this prosecutor, their criminal facts are hereby publicly prosecuted as follows:

　　After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army occupied the Northeast, in the spring of 1946, the U.S. government and the U.S. Army Department Shanghai 44 Overseas Observation Group (External Survey Delachment44), abbreviated as E.S.D.44, whose public name was the U.S. Army Liaison Group (U.S. Army Liaison Group), abbreviated as (A.L.G.), successively established consulates and U.S. military liaison sub-groups in Shenyang and Changchun, and sent spies Nishida, Walsh, Hunt, and Li Jiasheng (W.H. Richardson) to the Northeast. Nishida, Wells, and Hunt used the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang as a base, and Li Jiasheng used the Changchun Liaison Sub-Group as a cover to recruit defendants Sasaki Hirotsune, Boyan Cang, Wu Renjie, and other remnants of Japanese fascists and Mongolian-Han traitors to establish spy organizations in various parts of Northeast China, stealing our military, political, economic, and transportation intelligence, and carrying out espionage conspiracies to undermine the people's revolutionary cause in our liberated areas.

　　The defendant Sasaki Hirotsune was introduced to Nishida (who later moved to the Shenyang U.S. military liaison sub-group), the person in charge of espionage at the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang, by American spy Bei shi＠① Zhuo Ci (Japanese, alias Minami) in October 1947, and served as an American spy, with the spy code name S.S.K. According to secret materials seized, such as Sasaki Hirotsune's spy work plan, intelligence drafts, and spy personnel resumes, Sasaki Hirotsune, since accepting the espionage mission in 1947, translated intelligence for Nishida at the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang, and collected important intelligence materials such as military maps and strategic geography of Northeast China. The defendant went to the former U.S. Consulate in Shenyang once or twice a week to report to Nishida. At the same time, he actively developed a spy organization, and successively recruited spies Sakasita Kiichi, Cao Chengde, Xiao Yaoting, Takeuchi Hajime, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Yang Zhaohe, and the fugitive Japanese secret agent Yato Tsūji, White Russian Nikolai Sandovich, and Kuomintang secret agent Guo Baolai, and other 20 people. At the same time, Nishida separately established a spy organization with the code name "T.S.", which was also handed over to Sasaki Hirotsune for command. According to Sasaki Hirotsune's report to Nishida in April 1948 on the distribution of the "T.S." spy organization: "The headquarters moved to Beiping in February of the 37th year of the Republic of China. There are branches in Shenyang and Beiping. The intelligence strongholds under the Shenyang branch include Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Tumen, Hailar, Manzhouli, and Hunchun," a total of eleven locations. The confessions of the spies Sakasita Kiichi and Cao Chengde, who have been captured by us, are sufficient to prove that American imperialism established a vast spy organization in our liberated areas, and Sasaki Hirotsune used this vast spy organization to steal our intelligence. According to the seized intelligence drafts and the confessions of Sasaki Hirotsune, Cao Chengde, Sakasita Kiichi, Xiao Yaoting, Takeuchi Hajime, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Yang Zhaohe, etc., they successively collected our "Harbin Military and Political Situation," "Harbin Internal and External Security Situation," "Kaiyuan People's Liberation Army Movements," "Siping Military, Political, Economic, and Social Dynamics," "Situation in the Liberated Areas between Harbin, Changchun and Changchun, Shenyang," "People's Liberation Army September Offensive Dynamics," "Northeast Liberated Area Eastern Border Trunk Roads," "North Manchuria Railway Transportation Situation," "Binjiang Station Train Transportation Statistics Table," "General Overview of the Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Government Organization," "Resumes and Living Conditions of Key Leaders," "Inner Mongolia Highway Transportation Situation," and other important intelligence, totaling 78 copies. As a result, he received a written reward from Nishida, and his spy salary was also increased from US$25 to US$75 per month. Before the complete liberation of the Northeast in October 1948, the American spy agency, in view of the military crisis of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Northeast, in order to further undermine the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, Nishida personally instructed Sasaki Hirotsune at the end of September of the same year to formulate a new spy activity plan. After receiving the order, Sasaki Hirotsune and others immediately formulated the "October 潜伏 Activity Plan," deciding to use Xiao Yaoting, Sakasita Kiichi, Yang Zhaohe, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Takeuchi Hajime, and the "T.S." spy organization commanded by Sasaki Hirotsune to open shops as a cover, using the Yali Restaurant as their spy liaison stronghold, to continue 潜伏ing in Shenyang and strengthen the collection of military and political intelligence from our liberated areas and Inner Mongolia. The activity funds were set at US$500 to US$1,000 per month. Under this general plan, Cao Chengde was responsible for specifically targeting the Inner Mongolia region, formulating the "Work Plan for Each Station Under the Eastern Mongolia Headquarters," plotting to set up an intelligence headquarters in Shenyang, and liaison stations in Wangye Temple, Changchun, Siping, Jinzhou, Zhengjiatun, Tongliao, and other places, with 16 intelligence officers. The entire spy 潜伏 organization was under the overall command of Sasaki Hirotsune, with Sakasita Kiichi as his assistant. On October 26, Sasaki Hirotsune and Sakasita Kiichi went to the Shenyang branch of the U.S. military liaison group and received two U.S.-made small R.D.R.-style AC/DC 15-watt transceivers, one small generator, one set of U.S.-made codebooks, five gold ingots (originally nine), and American cigarettes as spy funds. After the liberation of Shenyang, after various investigations, the entire case was successively solved starting on November 21, 1948. Sasaki Hirotsune, Sakasita Kiichi, Cao Chengde, Xiao Yaoting, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Yang Zhaohe, Takeuchi Hajime, and other criminals were arrested by us, and two U.S.-made R.D.R.-style AC/DC small transceivers, one small generator, one set of U.S.-made codes, spy funds of five gold ingots, the "June 潜伏 Activity Plan" and the "October 潜伏 Activity Plan" formulated by Sasaki under Nishida's orders in 1948, one copy each, Cao Chengde's "潜伏 Plan for Each Station in Eastern Mongolia," one copy, one copy of Nishida's "Instruction Letter Regarding 潜伏 Activities" to Sasaki in September 1948, one letter of Nishida's "Request for Intelligence" to Sasaki on July 22, 1948, 13 items of materials such as resumes, reports, meeting decisions, and activity methods of the American spy "T.S." organization personnel under Sasaki's command, one copy of the former Shenyang "American Consulate" political overseas Chinese certificate No. 117 issued to Sasaki by the Kuomintang Northeast剿总政务委员会, 40 military maps and strategic geographies collected by Sasaki, and 28 various intelligence drafts.

　　The defendant Boyan Cang was introduced to Li Jiasheng, the head of the Changchun branch of the U.S. military liaison group, by American spies Nakamura Joji (Japanese-American) and Asao Tatsuo (Japanese) in January 1947 and served as a spy, with his spy code name being Toas#4. According to the seized materials and the defendant's confession, in February 1947, under the instruction of Li Jiasheng, he went to Zhengjiatun and other places with another American spy, the Mongolian traitor Tao Ke Tao, to organize Mongolian traitors and carry out sabotage activities, and used his past classmate relationship to attempt to instigate our Inner Mongolia military and political personnel, plotting to incite a coup in Inner Mongolia. In July of the same year, he was ordered by Li Jiasheng to establish an intelligence station in our liberated area. His work plan: The first step was to advance the intelligence station to the former Guoqi, the second step was to advance to Baichengzi, and then develop in two routes towards Wangye Temple and Hailar. Under the defendant's active activities, he successively collected various intelligence from our liberated area, including: "Political Activities and Organizational Situation in Wangye Temple, Inner Mongolia," "Current Military and Governmental Status of Wangye Temple," "Railway Situation from Qiqihar to Baichengzi," "Movements of Key Personnel in Wangye Temple," "Organization and Work Situation of the People's Government of the Former Guoqi," "Situation in the Liberated Area between Changchun and Tieling," "Situation of the Harbin Ethnic Representatives Conference," etc., all of which have been delivered to Li Jiasheng. In November 1947, as Changchun was in imminent danger of being surrounded by our army, the Changchun branch of the U.S. military liaison group was forced to withdraw to Beiping. After that, Li Jiasheng still frequently sent Nakamura Joji and Asao Tatsuo to Changchun to inspect the defendant's work. After the connection was interrupted, the defendant followed the pre-arranged plan and came to Shenyang from Changchun on July 13, 1948, and made contact with the Shenyang branch of the U.S. military liaison group, and also submitted "Changes in the Organization of the Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Government and Resumes of Newly Appointed Persons in Charge" to the Shenyang branch of the U.S. military liaison group. After that, he carried out espionage activities under the leadership of Shen Lefu, the head of the Shenyang branch of the U.S. military liaison group, and his assistant Nishida. On October 27 of the same year, before the liberation of Shenyang, the headquarters of the U.S. military liaison group in Shanghai sent Miyadam to Shenyang to arrange 潜伏 work. He summoned Boyan Cang to the group to assign 潜伏 tasks, and handed over to Boyan Cang two U.S.-made R.D.R.-style AC/DC 15-watt small transceivers, ten U.S.-made codebooks, and an additional US$300 and 16 bags of foreign flour as spy funds. After the liberation of Shenyang, after various investigations, he was arrested by us and two U.S.-made R.D.R.-style AC/DC 15-watt transceivers, one generator, and ten U.S.-made codebooks were seized.

　　The defendant Wu Renjie, as early as December 1946, followed American spy Barandson (Chinese name Bai Yingsheng), who used the Shenyang office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration as a cover, to Liaobei and Tongliao areas, under the pretext of investigating relief situations, to steal intelligence from our liberated area and supply it to the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang. In the winter of 1947, Barandson introduced Wu Renjie to American spy Wells to be responsible for intelligence transportation between Shenyang and Tianjin, sending important military and political intelligence from our liberated area to Tianjin. After Wells left Shenyang in March 1948, Wu Renjie's espionage work was led by another spy, Hunt, who lived on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang, and he still served as the intelligence transportation between Shenyang and Tianjin. Wu contacted Hunt every time at night, at Hunt's place on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang. His monthly spy salary was US$40, and each transportation fee was US$25. When Wu Renjie returned to Shenyang from Tianjin on October 12, 1948, he received instructions from Hunt: "Land transmission of intelligence is stopped, and communication by radio is used instead." So, on the morning of the 28th, Wu went to Hunt's place in a room next to Walter's office on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang, following Hunt's order, to receive the 潜伏 mission, and received two U.S.-made R.D.R.-style AC/DC 15-watt transceivers, one generator, five U.S.-made codebooks, and spy funds of gold ingots and gold bars totaling ten, and one box of American cigarettes, which Hunt personally sent to Wu Renjie's home from the "Consulate" in a jeep. After the liberation of Shenyang, the defendant hid in Hanzhong Clinic, Building 3, No. 3, Heping New Village. After being discovered by our investigation, he was arrested, and two U.S.-made small radio stations R.D.R.-style AC/DC 15-watt transceivers, one generator, five U.S.-made codebooks, and spy funds of gold ingots and gold bars totaling ten were seized.

　　In summary, the above facts fully prove that the former U.S. military liaison sub-groups in Shenyang and Changchun and the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang were the American imperialism's spy command and cover organs. The defendants Sasaki Hirotsune, Boyan Cang, Wu Renjie, etc., under the command of the above-mentioned American imperialist spy organs, engaged in recruiting remnants of Japanese fascists and Mongolian and Han traitors, establishing vast spy organizations, stealing our military and political secret intelligence, attempting to incite rebellion, setting up secret radio stations, continuing 潜伏, and engaging in espionage crimes such as undermining our people's revolutionary cause. Due to the conclusive evidence and irrefutable facts, the defendants have all confessed. This kind of espionage conspiracy is a real destruction of our people's revolutionary cause, endangering world peace, and violating the laws of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed, please judge according to law.

    当蒋匪军队侵占东北后，于一九四六年春，美国政府和美国陆军部上海四四海外观察组（Ｅｘｔ　ｅｒｎａｌ　Ｓｕｙｖｅｙ　Ｄｅｌａｃｈｍｅｕｔ４４）简称Ｅ·Ｓ·Ｄ·４４其对外公开名义为美军联络团（Ｕ·Ｓ·Ａｒｍｙ　Ｌｉａｉｓｏｎ　Ｇｒｏｕｐ），简称（Ａ·Ｌ·Ｇ·），先后在沈阳、长春两地设立领事馆和美军联络分团，并派间谍西田（Ｎｉｓｈｉｄａ）威尔斯（Ｗａｌｓｈ）亨特（Ｈｕｎｔ）李嘉胜（Ｗ·Ｈ·Ｒｉｃｈａｒｄｓｏｎ）等来东北，西田、威尔斯、亨特依据前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”为基地，李嘉胜以长春联络分团为掩护，从事收罗被告佐佐木弘经、伯彦苍、吴人杰等日本法西斯残余、蒙汉奸细在我东北各地建立间谍组织，刺探我军事、政治、经济、交通情报，进行破坏我解放区人民革命事业的间谍阴谋活动。
    被告佐佐木弘经于一九四七年十月经美国间谍北ｓｈí＠①卓次（日本人，化名米那米）介绍给前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”的间谍负责人西田（后又迁住沈阳美军联络分团）充当美国间谍，间谍代号为Ｓ·Ｓ·Ｋ。据查获佐佐木弘经之间谍工作计划书、情报底稿、间谍人员履历书等秘密材料证明佐佐木弘经自一九四七年接受间谍任务后，即为前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”内之西田翻译情报，并搜集我东北之军事地图、兵要地志等重要情报材料。该犯每周赴前驻沈美领事馆向西田汇报工作一次或两次。同时积极发展间谍组织，先后经佐佐木弘经收罗间谍人员坂下喜一、曹承德、肖耀庭、竹内始、山村嘉昭、杨朝和及在逃之日本特务谷户通滋、白俄尼古莱山道维奇，及国民党特务郭宝来等二十余人。同时由西田另外建立一代号“Ｔ·Ｓ·”的间谍组织，亦交佐佐木弘经负责指挥。据佐佐木弘经于一九四八年四月向西田报告“Ｔ·Ｓ·”间谍组织分布情况称：“本部于民国三十七年二月迁北平，支部有沈阳、北平两处，沈阳支部所属情报据点，有长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、图们、海拉尔、满洲里、珲春”等十一处之多，已由我捕获之间谍分子坂下喜一、曹承德等供述，足以证明美帝国主义在我解放区建立庞大的间谍组织，佐佐木弘经即使用这一庞大的间谍组织，刺探我之情报。根据查获情报底稿及佐佐木弘经、曹承德、坂下喜一、肖耀庭、竹内始、山村嘉昭、杨朝和等供述，先后曾搜集了我“哈尔滨军政情况”、“哈尔滨内外治安情况”、“开原解放军动向”、“四平军政经济及社会动态”、“哈、长与长、沈间解放区情况”、“解放军九月攻势动态”、“东北解放区东部国境干线道路”、“北满铁路运输情况”、“滨江站火车运输统计表”、“内蒙人民自治政府组织概况”、“主要负责人简历、生活情况”、“内蒙公路交通情况”等重要情报共计七十八份。因而得到西田书面奖励，其间谍薪金亦由每月美元二十五元提升到美元七十五元。一九四八年十月东北全部解放前夕，美国间谍机关鉴于东北蒋匪军事危急，他们为进一步破坏中国人民革命事业，由西田于同年九月底亲自指示佐佐木弘经拟定新的间谍活动计划。佐佐木弘经等受命后，当即制订“十月潜伏活动计划”，决定以肖耀庭、坂下喜一、杨朝和、山村嘉昭、竹内始及佐佐木弘经所指挥的“Ｔ·Ｓ·”间谍组织，用开设商店为掩护，以亚利餐厅为其间谍联络据点，继续潜伏沈阳活动，加强搜集我解放区和内蒙的军政情报。活动经费确定每月为五百至一千美元。在此总的计划下，又由曹承德负责专以内蒙地区为工作对象，拟定“东蒙本部所属各站工作计划”，阴谋企图在沈阳设情报总站，王爷庙、长春、四平、锦州、郑家屯、通辽等地设联络站，情报员为十六名。以上全部间谍潜伏组织，由佐佐木弘经负责全盘指挥，以坂下喜一为助手，于十月二十六日佐佐木弘经偕同坂下喜一至沈阳美军联络团分团领到美制小型Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部，小型发电机一部，美制密码本一套，金元宝五个（原为九个）及美国纸烟等物品作间谍经费。沈阳解放后，经多方侦悉，于一九四八年十一月二十一日开始相继将全案破获，佐佐木弘经、坂下喜一、曹承德、肖耀庭、山村嘉昭、杨朝和、竹内始等犯，被我逮捕，并查获美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流小型收发报机两部，小型发电机一台，美制密码一套，间谍经费金元宝五个，一九四八年佐佐木奉西田命令所拟定之“六月潜伏活动计划书”和“十月潜伏活动计划书”各一件，曹承德写的“东蒙各站潜伏计划书”一件，一九四八年西田给佐佐木“关于潜伏活动之指示信”一件，一九四八年九月西田给佐佐木“关于调查北满铁路运输纲要之指示信”一封，一九四八年七月二十二日西田向佐佐木“索取情报信件”两封，佐佐木指挥下之美国间谍“Ｔ·Ｓ·”组织人员履历、报告、会议讨论决定、活动方法等材料十三件，国民党东北剿总政务委员会发给佐佐木的前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”留用之政侨字一一七号日侨证明一份，佐佐木所搜集之军事地图、兵要地志共四十份，各种情报底稿二十八份。
　 被告伯彦苍于一九四七年一月经美国间谍中村让次（美籍日人）与麻生达夫（日本人）介绍给美军长春联络分团团长李嘉胜充当间谍，其间谍代号是Ｔｏａｓ＃４。据查获材料及伯犯自供，于一九四七年二月奉李嘉胜指示与另一美国间谍蒙奸陶克陶赴郑家屯等地，组织蒙奸，进行破坏活动，并利用其过去同学关系，妄图策反我内蒙军政人员，阴谋策动内蒙政变。同年七月又奉李嘉胜命令，在我解放区建立情报站，其工作计划：第一步是将情报站推进至前郭旗，第二步推进到白城子，然后分两路向王爷庙、海拉尔发展。该犯在积极活动下，先后搜集了我解放区之各种情报，计有：“内蒙王爷庙政治活动与组织情况”、“王爷庙政府与军事现状”、“齐齐哈尔至白城子铁路情况”、“王爷庙要员动态”、“前郭旗人民政府的组织与工作情况”、“长春至铁岭间解放区情况”、“哈尔滨民族代表会议情况”等，均已送交李嘉胜。一九四七年十一月长春敌在我军包围下岌岌可危，美军联络团长春分团被迫撤往北平后，李嘉胜仍经常派中村让次、麻生达夫来长春检查伯犯工作，其后联络中断，该犯乃按预定计划于一九四八年七月十三日由长春来沈阳，与沈阳美军联络分团取得联系，又将“内蒙人民自治政府组织变更状况及新任负责人简历”等送交沈阳美军联络团分团。此后即在沈阳美军联络分团团长沈乐甫及其助手西田领导下进行间谍活动。同年十月二十七日沈阳解放前夕，上海美军联络团总部，派密亚当（Ｍｙａｄａｍ）来沈阳布置潜伏工作，当将伯彦苍召至该团授予潜伏任务，并交与伯犯美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特小型收发报机两部，美制密码十本，另美元三百元、洋面十六袋，作为间谍经费，沈阳解放后，经多方侦悉，被我逮捕并查获美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部、发电机一台、美制密码十本。
    被告吴人杰远在一九四六年十二月，即随以联总沈阳办事处为掩护之美国间谍巴兰森（Ｂａｒａｎｄｓｏｎ华名白英生）赴辽北、通辽一带，借口调查救济情况，刺探我解放区情报，供给前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”。一九四七年冬巴兰森便将吴人杰介绍与美国间谍威尔斯担任沈阳、天津间之情报交通工作，将我解放区之重要军政情报送往天津。一九四八年三月威尔斯离沈阳后，吴人杰的间谍工作，即由住在前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”二楼之另一间谍亨特领导，仍担任沈阳、天津间之情报交通工作。 吴每次与亨特接头联络， 时间均在晚上，地点在均在前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”二楼亨特处，其每月间谍薪俸为美元四十元，每次交通费美元二十五元。一九四八年十月十二日吴人杰由天津返沈阳时得亨特指示：“陆上传递情报停止，改用电台联络”，遂于二十八日晨吴依亨特命令赴前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”二楼瓦尔德办公室旁边一间房子之亨特处，受领潜伏任务，并领到美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部、发电机一部、美制密码五本及间谍经费金元宝、金块共十个、美国纸烟一箱，由亨特亲自从“领事馆”用吉普车送至吴人杰家。沈阳解放后，该犯隐蔽于和平新村三栋三号汉中诊所，被我侦悉后，将其逮捕，并查获美制小型电台Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部、发电机一台、美制密码五本、间谍经费金元宝、金块共十个。
    总核上述事实，充分证明美国前驻沈阳、长春美军联络分团和前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”是美帝国主义的间谍指挥和掩护机关，被告佐佐木弘经、伯彦苍、吴人杰等在上述美帝国主义间谍机关指挥下，则从事收罗日本法西斯残余和蒙、汉奸细，建立庞大的间谍组织，刺探我军政机密情报，妄图策动叛乱，架设秘密电台，继续潜伏，从事破坏我人民革命事业等阴谋间谍罪行，由于证据确凿，铁案如山，被告等均已供认不讳，此种间谍阴谋罪行，实属破坏我人民革命事业，危害世界和平，违犯我中华人民共和国之法律，故提起公诉，请依法审判。
