　　Hearts Turn to Stalin
    Lü Jian
    Great savior of mankind,
    Beloved Stalin,
    This year is your seventieth birthday,
    What good gift should we offer you?

    I heard that the green lingzhi mushroom,
    If eaten, grants immortality,
    If there really is a lingzhi mushroom,
    We must find it, no matter the hardship!

    Spur the horse out of Beijing,
    Traveling a thousand miles like the wind,
    Rushing past the Jade Gate Pass by night,
    Arriving at the Kunlun Mountains at sunrise.

    The Kunlun mountaintops are white with snow,
    The Kunlun mountaintops are high and tall,
    Difficult to find after searching far and wide,
    Where can lingzhi mushrooms be found in this world?

    I heard that the Queen Mother has peaches of immortality,
    If eaten, grants immortality,
    If there really are peaches of immortality,
    We must find them by any means!

    My hands turn into wings to fly,
    The spring breeze blows at my wings,
    Blooms of clouds dyed with red glow,
    Blooms of raindrops, blooms of flowers.

    Soaring into the sky to find a gift,
    Where is the heavenly palace in the clouds?
    Difficult to obtain by any means,
    Where can the great peaches of immortality be found?

    Pearls shine brilliantly everywhere,
    Agate glows red everywhere,
    Treasures everywhere beyond counting,
    My heart is uneasy not finding a good gift.

    Riding a horse is not as good as riding lightning,
    A thousand miles, ten thousand miles in the blink of an eye,
    Flying high is not as good as riding lightning,
    Let me take a trip around the Earth.

    Low places are lakes and plains,
    High places are forests and mountains,
    Good crops on the land,
    White sails floating on the green sea.

    Up to the blue sky, down to the human world,
    I have traveled all over the entire Earth,
    Searching here and there, hard to obtain,
    Where can the best gift be found?

    Suddenly I hear singing all over the mountains and fields,
    Joyful songs that are so lovely,
    The songs break down national borders and boundaries,
    Singing "Stalin" with one voice:

    "Ten thousand rays of bright light shine overhead,
    The river ice melts and the snow disappears,
    You lead the world's people to a great liberation,
    You are dearer than the sun!

    "The Kremlin issues commands,
    The great commander has brilliant ideas,
    The people's army wins!
    The enemy's fortresses collapse!

    "Your light shines everywhere,
    Your words warm the heart,
    You and the world's people are like fish and water,
    You have a youthful face and the hair of an old sage!

    Thousands and thousands of people are like one person,
    Thousands and thousands of hearts are linked together,
    The one heart of thousands of people,
    Hearts turn to Stalin!"

    Why ride a fast horse
    To seek lingzhi mushrooms on Kunlun Mountain?
    Why enter the heavenly palace
    To steal peaches from the peach tree branches?

    There is no need for lingzhi mushrooms,
    There is no need for peaches of immortality,
    Your achievements are an eternal monument,
    Your glorious name will live for ten thousand years!

    Ah, great savior of mankind,
    Ah, beloved Stalin,
    If you ask what good gift
    Should we offer you on your seventieth birthday this year?

    "Thousands and thousands of people are like one person,
    Thousands and thousands of hearts are linked together,
    The one heart of thousands of people,
    Hearts turn to Stalin!"

　　心心向着斯大林
    吕剑
    人类的大救星，
    亲爱的斯大林，
    今年你的七十寿，
    献你什么好礼品？
　
    听说青青灵芝草，
    吃了长生人不老，
    若是真有灵芝草，
    千苦万难要去找！
　
    快马加鞭出北京，
    日行千里一阵风，
    星夜赶过了玉门关，
    日出时分到昆仑。
　
    昆仑山顶白雪白，
    昆仑山顶高又高，
    千寻万找难发现，
    人间哪有灵芝草？
　
    听说王母有蟠桃，
    吃了长生人不老，
    若是真有大蟠桃，
    千方百计要去找！
　
    双手化作翅膀飞，
    春风在我的翅边吹，
    朵朵的云彩染红霞，
    朵朵的雨珠朵朵的花。
　
    为找礼物腾云空，
    云中哪里有天宫？
    千方百计难得到，
    哪里能有大仙桃？
　
    遍地的珍珠光灿烂，
    遍地的玛瑙红艳艳，
    遍地的珍宝数不上，
    找不到好礼心不安。
　
    骑马不如骑闪电，
    千里万里一眨眼，
    高飞也不如骑闪电，
    让我地球上走一转。
　
    矮处是湖水和平原，
    高处是森林和大山，
    大地上面好庄稼，
    绿海上面飘白帆。
　
    上到青空下人间，
    整个地球全走遍，
    找来找去难到手，
    顶好的礼物那里有？
　
    忽听漫山遍野唱歌声，
    欢喜的歌声好动听，
    歌声打破了国界和边境，
    口口声声唱着“斯大林”：
　
    “万道明霞当头照，
    河水解冻冰雪消，
    你领着世界人民大翻身，
    你比那太阳还要亲！
　
    “克里姆宫发号令，
    大帅统兵主意高，
    人民的大军打胜了！
    敌人的堡垒垮台了！
　
    “你的光明普照着，
    你的言语暖人心，
    你和世界人民鱼和水，
    你童颜鹤发好青春！
　
    千人万人象一人，
    千心万心心连心，
    千万人民的一片心，
    心心向着斯大林！”
　
    要什么骑快马
    昆仑山上寻灵芝？
    要什么进天宫
    桃林枝上偷蟠桃？
　
    用不着灵芝草，
    用不着大仙桃，
    你的功业是永恒的碑，
    你的英名万万岁！
　
    啊，人类的大救星，
    啊，亲爱的斯大林，
    若问今年你的七十寿，
    到底献你什么好礼品？
　
    “千人万人象一人，
    千心万心心连心，
    千万人民的一片心，
    心心向着斯大林！”
    　　　　 一九四九年十二月十五日
