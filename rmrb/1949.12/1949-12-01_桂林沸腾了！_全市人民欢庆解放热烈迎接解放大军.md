Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 30th. Frontline reporters Chen Mu and Chen Fubei reported on the grand occasion of the people of Guilin warmly celebrating liberation and welcoming the People's Liberation Army, saying: After the People's Liberation Army cleared the battle around Guilin at 2:30 pm on the 22nd, it began to enter Guilin City along the Xiang-Gui Highway. At this time, after the first firecracker of welcome to the People's Liberation Army sounded, the people of the whole city opened their doors and rushed to the streets to join the welcoming ranks. This long-silent city immediately boiled over. When the majestic ranks of the People's Liberation Army passed through the city's streets, the crowds of welcomers thronged both sides. Smiling faces also stretched out from the windows of buildings along the street. Along the several-mile-long line from North Zhongshan Road to South Zhongshan Road, shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" continued to sound. The sound of firecrackers was endless along the way. In the area of the pseudo-Guangxi Provincial Bank on Guidong Road, the ground was covered with firecracker paper scraps. A red cloth banner three feet long with "Welcome the Meritorious People's Liberation Army into the City" hung high in the central area of the city, fluttering in the wind. Various colored slogans welcoming the Liberation Army were posted on the streets, alleys, and the entrances of many homes. In the jubilation, people expressed great love and respect for the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army. When a Liberation Army soldier passed North Zhongshan Road, he was lifted up by the local citizens as soon as he stopped. A teacher from Guilin Medical College saw a cook passing by carrying a burden and rushed forward to hold his hand tightly, saying, "You've worked too hard!" Just as the people of Guilin were celebrating liberation, White bandit planes came to strafe. This atrocity further increased the hatred of all the citizens of Guilin. The workers angrily tore off the reactionary slogans left by the White bandits on the walls, and the students sang songs celebrating liberation even louder. The order in Guilin City is currently good, shops have resumed business one after another, and schools have also resumed classes one after another.

　　桂林沸腾了！
  　全市人民欢庆解放热烈迎接解放大军
    【新华社华南前线三十日电】前线记者陈牧、陈福北报道桂林人民热烈庆祝解放和欢迎人民解放军的盛况称：人民解放军于廿二日下午二时半肃清桂林外围的战斗结束后，即沿湘桂公路源源开进桂林市。这时全市人民在欢迎解放军的第一声鞭炮响开后即纷纷打开大门，涌到街上参加欢迎的行列。这座沉寂已久的城市立刻沸腾起来了。当人民解放军雄伟的行列通过市内各街道时，两旁拥塞着欢迎的人群。街旁楼房的窗户里也伸出一个个的笑脸。从中山北路到中山南路一条数里长的行列里不断响起了“毛主席万岁！”“人民解放军万岁！”的欢呼声。鞭炮声更是沿途不绝。桂东路伪广西省银行一带，地上铺满了鞭炮纸屑。全市中心地区高悬着三丈长的“欢迎劳苦功高的人民解放军入城”的红布标语，迎风招展。大街小巷和许多住家的门口都贴上了欢迎解放军的各色标语。人们在欢腾中，对解放军指战员表示了极大的热爱和崇敬。一个解放军战士经过中山北路时，刚一停下就被该地的市民高举起来。桂林医专的一个教员看见一个炊事员挑着担子走过，连忙抢上前去紧握着他的手说：“你们太辛苦了！”正当桂林人民欢庆解放的时候，白匪飞机曾来扫射。这种暴行更增加了桂林全体市民的仇恨。工人们愤怒地撕去墙上白匪留下的反动标语，学生们庆祝解放的歌声也唱得更加响亮。现桂林市内秩序良好，商店相继恢复营业，学校亦已陆续复课。
