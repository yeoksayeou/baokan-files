Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 6th: The resolutions of the first Changsha All-Circles People's Representative Conference are being gradually implemented with the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. To implement the conference's resolution to focus on restoring and developing commerce, the Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce has decided to conduct industrial and commercial registration and investigation, and has already carried out the work of organizing street vendors. The Hunan Branch of the People's Bank has launched industrial and commercial loans, with the total amount loaned out in October reaching more than 3.3 billion yuan. At the same time, appropriate adjustments were made to the exchange rates in various parts of the province to facilitate trade between urban and rural areas. Trade companies have planned to purchase goods and organized economic teams to go to the countryside to purchase local products, while also promoting the sale of large quantities of salt, gauze, and other materials to rural areas according to actual needs. In terms of transportation, which is closely related to the restoration and development of commerce, strong coordination has also been carried out. Thanks to the workers' tireless repairs day and night, the Changsha-Wuchang section of the Yuehan Railway was opened to traffic in early November. Shipping from Changsha to various places has also gradually developed, with the total volume of goods transported in and out by Changsha shipping industry alone nearing 30,000 tons in October.

In order to implement the conference's resolution to eliminate special agents, all circles in Changsha launched a widespread propaganda campaign to eliminate special agents in late November. Students organized propaganda teams to promote the effort on the streets,座谈会 were held in various districts of the city, newspapers published special editions, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau held an exhibition on suppressing special agents and maintaining public security. In addition, the Military Control Commission accepted the suggestion of the Standing Committee of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference to extend the period for special agents to register. In order to implement the conference's resolution on municipal construction, the Municipal People's Government actively carried out the construction of tap water facilities, clearing garbage and repairing ditches in the city. In terms of culture and education, since the conference called for the establishment of a new learning order, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the Student Union have successively held forums for teachers and students. The majority of students in Changsha schools have linked practice with criticism and self-examination to formulate conscious codes of conduct. At present, the schools have initially overcome certain phenomena of extreme democracy, lack of organization, and lack of discipline that existed at the time of liberation, and have strengthened the unity between teachers and students.

　　长沙各界代表会议
    决议案已逐步实现
    【新华社长沙六日电】长沙市第一届各界人民代表会议的决议案，在各阶层人民的热情拥护下已逐步实现。为执行该会在目前着重恢复与发展商业的决议，市人民政府工商局决定进行工商业登记与调查，并已进行了整理摊贩工作。人民银行湖南分行举办了工商贷款，十月份贷出总额共达三十三亿余元，同时将本省各地汇率予以适当调整，以便利沟通城乡贸易。贸易公司则有计划地收购物资，并组织经济队下乡采购土产品，同时按实际需要把大批食盐、纱布等物资推销到农村去。与恢复和发展商业密切联系的运输事业方面，也做了有力的配合。在工人们不分昼夜的抢修下，粤汉路长沙武昌段十一月初已通车。长沙至各地的航运也渐有开展，十月间仅长沙轮船业进出货总运量即将近三万吨。
    为执行会议肃清特务的决议，长沙市各界于十一月下旬展开了广泛的肃清特务宣传运动。学生们组织了宣传队到街头宣传，市内各区举行了座谈会，各报都出了特刊，市公安局并举行了肃特治安展览会。此外，军管会并接受了各界人民代表会常设委员会的建议，延长特务登记时期。为执行会议关于市政建设的决议，市人民政府积极进行了自来水建设工程，清除市内垃圾和修理水沟等。在文教方面，自从该会号召建立新的学习秩序以来，青年团市工作委员会与学联筹委会相继举行教师学生座谈会。长市大多数学校的学生都联系实际从批评与检讨中订立自觉的生活公约。目前各校已初步克服了刚解放时存在着的某些极端民主的无组织无纪律现象，加强了师生间的团结。
