　　Interview with the Chinese Delegation Attending the Asian Women's Conference
    Feng Zhong
    The Chinese delegation attending the Asian Women's Conference includes women representatives from various parties, ethnic groups, occupations, and democratic classes. Among them are outstanding leaders of the women's movement, heroic female workers and students who protected factories and schools, combat heroes and labor heroes, models who supported the front lines, and workers in various children's welfare undertakings. It can be said that it is a microcosm of the unity of women on all fronts in New China.
    The liberation of Chinese women is inseparable from the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the victory of the People's Liberation War. Chinese women have recognized this truth from their long struggle experience. Many outstanding women, like men, joined the army and fought against all kinds of enemies on the front lines or behind enemy lines, and many outstanding female guerrillas and combat heroes emerged. Chen Yan, a female comrade representing the Third Field Army attending the Asian Women's Conference, is only twenty-two years old. She joined the guerrillas at the age of eighteen. On the front line, she braved gunfire and shells and selflessly rescued wounded comrades. Later, she transferred to work in the regular army and demonstrated a high degree of heroism in countless marches and battles, winning four hero medals. Ulan, a female hero representative from Inner Mongolia, organized a guerrilla force in 1946, which gradually expanded from thirteen people to more than two thousand. Ulan served as the political commissar and personally commanded the fighting, persisting until the complete liberation of Inner Mongolia.
    Most of the female comrades in the army participate in medical work and cultural troupes. In front-line field hospitals, female medical personnel often account for 35 to 40 percent of the total number. They stick to their posts under extremely difficult material conditions and carry out long-term struggles heroically and arduously. Ding Zhihui, the female director of a field hospital representing the Fourth Field Army, told reporters about some of her personal experiences: "During the Anti-Japanese War, female medical staff in the Suzhong District guerrilla隊 immediately carried the wounded to a safe place after each battle and disguised themselves as ordinary people to hide them. Sometimes forty or fifty wounded had to be scattered in a village more than thirty miles away. The medical staff pretended to be ordinary people visiting relatives or returning to their parents' home, carrying baskets covered with vegetables to hide medicine, and treated patients in various villages. Chopsticks for eating were used as tweezers for changing dressings, rice bowls were used as sterilization bowls, cooking pots were used as sterilization pots, and the used dressings were washed clean and reused. When the enemy's mopping-up operations were at their most intense, even ordinary people's homes could not hide the wounded. Sometimes the wounded had to be carried to the lake, loaded onto boats, and treated while drifting in the water. If they encountered enemy searches again, they had to immediately go ashore and hide." In the stage of the People's Liberation War, countless female heroes who were awarded for their work on the medical front emerged in North China, Northeast China, East China, Northwest China, the Central Plains, and other regions. The proportion of people who were commended accounted for 40 to 45 percent of the total number. Jiang Chunying, a female nurse from the First Field Army, rescued the wounded on the front line, carrying them over two mountain peaks and sending them to a safe zone. During the Huaihai Campaign, female medical staff Sun Yingxiu rescued more than twenty wounded on the front line. In the Northeast, the field hospital led by female director Ding Zhihui always worked with the front-line troops. The entire hospital staff had only seventy or so people, but sometimes they had to accommodate two or three thousand wounded. Everything was handled in an orderly manner.
    The vast rural women dedicated their husbands and sons to the revolutionary war, shouldered the responsibility of rural production themselves, and did everything possible to support the front lines. Among the representatives was Li Yujin, a woman from Yanji County, Jilin Province. She mobilized her husband to join the army, and her husband sacrificed himself in 1947. She then mobilized three younger brothers to join the army. She herself was busy with production in the fields all day long. During the land reform, her family was allocated eight hectares of paddy fields and three hectares and three mu of dry land. She did not need help from others at all, and she often took the initiative to help others with farming. At the first labor model conference in the county, she was selected as a labor model. Wang Yuecun, a representative from Shandong, said: During the tense days of the war, Shandong women sent 750 to 1,500 tons of grain to the front every day. From October last year to March this year, they made 320,000 sets of military uniforms.
    Before the liberation of the cities, female factory workers used various methods to carry out arduous struggles against the enemy. After liberation, they showed a high degree of enthusiasm in their production posts. Zhou Xingmei, a female worker from Shenxin No. 9 Factory in Shanghai, is a representative of East China. She served as the captain of the factory protection team during the liberation, crushing the special agents' conspiracy to sabotage the factory, so that the factory could start work immediately after liberation. When participating in the acceptance and inventory work, she cleared out many hidden materials and returned them to the state. Among the representatives from the Northeast, there is Zheng Shuxiang, a female lathe worker in a metal factory. In a short period of time, she learned all the techniques for manufacturing cylinder head expansion rings. The average male worker makes 500 expansion rings a day, while Zheng Shuxiang can make 1,000 a day, earning the honor of first-class model. Jiang Yuxiu, a female worker in the warping department of the Shenyang Textile Factory, increased her daily warping from 13,000 yards to 22,000 yards in a competition, and was selected as a second-class model on this year's "May Day" festival. Yao Fengzhi, a female gunpowder worker in the ordnance department, has been awarded five times in Harbin and Shenyang. She researched and improved the manufacturing of "60" shells.
    Some representatives have dedicated their lives to education and children's welfare work. Zhou Xiaopei, the female principal of Kaifeng Middle School representing Central China, has worked in the education field for more than twenty years. During her tenure as the principal of Luoyang Middle School in 1933 and 1934, many students who were educated by her participated in revolutionary work. Wang Cunyi, the chairman of the Xi'an YWCA representing the Northwest, taught books for nineteen years and also ran a nursery.
    New China has already seen female tractor drivers, female train drivers, and streetcar drivers with excellent skills. Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in Heilongjiang Province, is one of the representatives from the Northeast. In 1947, she was only eighteen years old. She saw that "Basha" in the Soviet film "Defend the Motherland" was a woman who could drive a tank to defend the motherland, which aroused her infinite envy. She found a way, overcame physical and technical difficulties, and is now driving a tractor across the vast land of the motherland, working happily every day. Due to her influence, many young women in the Northeast have learned or are learning to drive tractors.
    Tens of thousands of Chinese women are fighting and working in various positions. The heroic struggle and great victory of Chinese women have given a powerful inspiration to women in various colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia. The experience of the heroic struggle of Chinese women can be used as a reference for oppressed women in various countries. The Chinese delegation attending the Asian Women's Conference has told these experiences to women in various Asian countries. At the same time, it has also learned a lot of experience from the representatives of various countries attending the Asian Women's Conference, especially the advanced Soviet representatives, which is of great help to our construction work that has already begun.

　　访出席亚洲妇代会的中国代表团
    冯仲
    出席亚洲妇女代表会议的中国代表团，包括了各党派，各民族、各种职业、各民主阶层的妇女代表。其中有卓越的妇女运动领袖，有英男的护厂、护校的女工、女学生，有战斗英雄和劳动英雄，有支援前线的模范，有各种儿童福利事业工作者，可以说，它是新中国各个战线上妇女团结的缩影。
    中国妇女的解放是与中国人民革命的胜利，与人民解放战争的胜利分不开的。中国妇女从长期地斗争体验中认识了这一真理。许多优秀妇女和男子一样地参加了军队，在敌前或敌后与各种各样的敌人作战，涌现了许多出色的女游击队员和战斗英雄。代表三野的女同志参加亚洲妇女代表会的陈炎，现年只二十二岁。她十八岁就参加了游击队。在火线上冒着枪林弹雨、奋不顾身地抢救负伤的战友。以后转入正规军工作，在无数次行军、战斗中发挥高度的英雄主义，荣获四次英雄奖章。内蒙代表女英雄乌兰，一九四六年组织游击队，由十三个人逐渐扩大到两千多人，乌兰担任政委，亲自指挥打仗，一直坚持到内蒙的全部解放。
    部队中的女同志参加医务工作和文工团的占多数。在前线野战医院里，女医务人员常常占总数百分之三十五到四十，她们在物质条件极端困难的情况下，坚持自己的岗位，英勇艰苦地进行长期的斗争。四野的妇女代表野战医院院长丁治辉对记者谈起她亲身经历过的一些情景：“在抗日战争期间，苏中区游击队的女医务员们，在每一次战斗结束以后，立刻将伤员抬到安全地方，化装成老百姓隐藏起来，有时候四、五十个伤员要散藏到三十多里远近的一片村子里。医务人员扮成走亲戚、回娘家的老百姓，提着篮子，用青菜盖住医药，往来各村治疗，吃饭用的筷子当换药的镊子，饭碗当消毒碗，煮饭锅当消毒锅，治疗用过的附料，洗干净后再用，在敌人扫荡最激烈时，连老百姓家里也不能藏，有时要把伤员抬到湖边，装在船上，飘泊在水里治疗，如再遇到敌人搜索，又要马上登岸藏起来。”到人民解放战争阶段，华北、东北、华东、西北、中原等区都涌现出无数在医疗战线上受奖的女英雄，立功的人数比例占总人数百分之四十到四十五。一野女护士姜纯英在火线上抢救伤员，背负伤员翻越两个山头，送到安全地带。淮海战役时女医务员孙英秀在火线上救下二十多伤员。在东北女院长丁治辉领导的野战医院始终随第一线部队工作，全院医务人员只有七十多，有时却要收容二、三千伤员。把一切事情处理得有条不紊。
    广大的农村妇女为革命战争献出自己的丈夫和儿子，自己担起农村生产的责任，尽一切力量支援前线，代表中有吉林省延吉县的妇女李玉今，她动员了自己的丈夫参军，丈夫在一九四七年牺牲了。她又动员了三个弟弟参军。自己终日忙于地里的生产。在土地改革中，她家分到八垧水田，三垧三亩旱田，完全不用别人帮忙，她还常常主动去帮助别人耕作。在全县第一届劳动模范大会上，她被选为劳模。山东代表王月村说：在战争紧张的日子，山东妇女每天送到前方去的粮食达七百五十吨至一千五百吨。从去年十月到今年三月，她们做了三十二万套军装。
    工厂的女工们在城市解放以前，用各种方式和敌人进行艰苦的斗争。解放以后，在生产岗位上又表现了高度的积极性。上海申新九厂女工周杏妹是华东区的代表。她在解放时担任护厂大队长，粉碎了特务破坏工厂的阴谋，使工厂在解放后能立即开工，在参加接收清点工作时，又清理出许多隐蔽的器材，还给国家。在东北来的代表里，更有金属工厂镟盘女工郑淑香，她在短期内学会了制造汽顶涨圈的全部技术。普通男工平均一天做五百个涨圈，郑淑香一天能做一千个，获得一等模范的荣誉。沈阳纺织厂整经部女工姜毓秀在一次竞赛中，由每天整经一万三千码增加到两万两千码，今年“五一”节被选为二等模范。兵工部门的火药女工姚凤芝在哈尔滨和沈阳两地先后立过五次功，她研究改进了制造“六○”炮弹。
    有些代表半生献身于教育和儿童福利工作。华中代表开封中学女校长周筱沛，在教育岗位上工作了二十多年。一九三三、一九三四年任洛阳中学校长时期，受她教育的许多学生参加了革命工作。西北代表西安女青年会理事长王存义教过十九年书，也办过托儿所。
    新中国已经出现了具有优良技术的女拖拉机手，女火车司机和电车司机。黑龙江省第一个拖拉机手梁军，是东北来的代表之一，一九四七年，她才十八岁。她看到苏联“保卫祖国”电影片中的“巴沙”是个妇女，能开坦克车保卫祖国，引起她无限的羡慕，她找到了门路，克服了体力和技术上的困难，现在驾着拖拉机驰骋在辽阔的祖国大地上，每天愉快地劳动。由于她的影响，东北已经有许多青年妇女学会了或正在学驾驶拖拉机。
    成千成万的中国妇女在各个不同的岗位上斗争着，劳动着。中国妇女们的英勇斗争和伟大胜利给予亚洲各殖民地半殖民地国家的妇女一个有力的启示，中国妇女英勇斗争的经验是可以供各国被压迫的妇女们参考的，出席亚洲妇女代表会议的中国代表团已把这些经验告诉给亚洲各国的妇女，同时，也从出席亚洲妇代会的各国代表特别是先进的苏联代表学得许多经验，这对于我们已经开始的建设工作是有绝大帮助的。
