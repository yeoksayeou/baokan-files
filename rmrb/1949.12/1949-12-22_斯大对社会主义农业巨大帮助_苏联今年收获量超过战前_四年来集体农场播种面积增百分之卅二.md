　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: TASS reports: Soviet socialist agriculture in 1949 achieved new and great successes in fulfilling the Five-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the national economy.

　　Over the past four years, the sown area of collective farms has increased by 32 percent, and in 1949, the total grain harvest exceeded the pre-war 1940 harvest. The harvests of the main pre-war industrial crops—cotton, flax, hemp, and sunflowers—were also surpassed. The domestic sugar beet harvest this year significantly exceeded last year's harvest.

　　This year, collective farms have expanded the area under winter crops and completed the sowing of winter crops earlier than last year. Collective farms have prepared eight million hectares more land for next spring than last year.

　　In 1949, the first year of implementing the Stalin Plan to transform the nature of the steppe and forest-steppe zones of the European part of the Soviet Union, the plan for planting forest shelter belts has been substantially exceeded, land cultivation methods have been improved, and the area planted with perennial grasses has more than doubled. In the spring and autumn of 1949, collective farms alone afforested 142,000 hectares.

　　In the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, collective farms have achieved significant success in restoring and further developing collective livestock breeding. In recent years, the number of livestock on collective farms has exceeded the pre-war number of all livestock used for production. The most arduous and laborious process for collective farms—plowing—is becoming more and more mechanized each year, and the degree of mechanization has significantly exceeded pre-war levels.

　　The reason for these achievements by collective farms is the enormous help given to socialist agriculture by the government, the Bolshevik Party, and Comrade Stalin himself. Socialist industry supplies agriculture with more and more basic means of production year after year. For example, in 1949, agriculture received three to four times the number of tractors and agricultural machinery it received in the pre-war year of 1940. In 1949, collective farms obtained 1.4 times more mineral fertilizers from the state than before the war.

### 斯大对社会主义农业巨大帮助　苏联今年收获量超过战前  四年来集体农场播种面积增百分之卅二

　　斯大对社会主义农业巨大帮助
    苏联今年收获量超过战前       
    四年来集体农场播种面积增百分之卅二
    【新华社北京二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：一九四九年的苏联社会主义农业，在履行恢复和发展国民经济的五年计划上获得了新的巨大成就。
    过去四年，集体农场的播种面积已增加百分之三十二，而在一九四九年，谷物的总收获量已超过了战前一九四○年的收获量。战前主要工业作物——棉花、亚麻、大麻与向日葵的收获量也被超过。在今年国内甜菜的收获量，已相当大地超过去年的收获量。
    今年，集体农场已扩大了冬季作物的耕种面积，并较去年提早完成冬季作物的播种。集体农场已为明年春季比去年多准备了八百万公顷的土地。
    在一九四九年实现改变苏联欧洲部分草原和森林草原地带之自然的斯大林计划的头一年，种植森林防护带的计划已经相当大地超过了，土地耕耘的方法也已经改进，同时，栽种多年生牧草的地区已扩大一倍多。在一九四九年的春天和秋天，单单集体农场就造林十四万二千公顷。
    在战后五年计划的头四年，集体农场在恢复和进一步发展集体牲畜饲养上获得了重大的成就。这几年集体农场上的牲畜，已超过战前的一切用于生产上的牲畜的数目。集体农场最艰辛费力的过程——耕犁，每年越来越机械化，其机械化的程度，已相当大的越过了战前。
    集体农场之所以获得这些成就，是由于政府、布尔什维克党及斯大林同志本人对于社会主义农业的巨大帮助。社会主义工业一年一年地供给农业以更多的基本生产手段。例如，在一九四九年，农业所获得的拖拉机和农业机器，即为战前一九四○年的三——四倍。一九四九年，集体农场自国家取得较战前多一点四倍的矿物肥料。
