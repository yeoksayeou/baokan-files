　　Dalian Textile Factory
    Rebuilds Financial System to Overcome Disordered Expenditures
    [This newspaper reports] To strictly implement the economic accounting system and overcome the past chaotic phenomenon of expenditure, the Dalian Textile Factory has re-established the budget and final accounts system and financial system. Although the factory had established a budget and final accounts system in the past, it was not thoroughly implemented and became a mere formality, resulting in a very chaotic financial system and budget. The main reason was that the person in charge of finance and the cadres did not fully understand the importance of the budget and final accounts, believing that the budget and the final accounts were two different things, and it was not necessary to follow the budget. As long as there was an actual need, regardless of whether there was a budget or not, money would be given if approved by the factory director. For example, when signing a contract for the construction of a club, it was not done through the finance department, nor was a budget made. When the contract was signed, the finance department was asked for funds. If the money was not given, the contract had already been signed. If the money was given, there was no budget. There was no way to take care of the work, so the money had to be given, which caused chaos in the expenditure of funds. Based on the above shortcomings, the financial system was re-stipulated, and a budget system was established. After being approved by the Industry Department, the finance department made reports and notified the relevant departments to act in accordance with the regulations. If there are any violations, no payment will be made. In the past, the budget and final accounts of indirect materials were controlled by the custodian, and the production technology department was not notified of the actual amount used each month. Therefore, the production technology department had no way to study why the quality fluctuated. The scope of the budget prepared by each department was also unclear. For example, when the glass of each factory was damaged and repaired, the general affairs department was responsible for including it in the repair fee, but each factory actually included it in indirect materials, which caused a chaotic procedure. This time, the budget scope of each department and factory was clearly stipulated, and the number of practical materials used by the production technology department each month and the figures for reducing costs were notified to the relevant departments in writing, ordering them to study the reasons and decide on the budget and final accounts, so as to overcome and correct the above deviations. The summary tables submitted by the accounting department to the finance department in the past were on the 13th or 14th, or even dragged on to the 20th. This time it is stipulated that the latest should be no later than the 9th. The wage and labor organization department stipulates that the wages must be determined and handed over to the comrade in charge of calculation by the 26th of the month. The wages of new workers who arrive in the last ten days of the month are postponed to the next month. The finance department should strictly implement the audit system. No matter how busy the vouchers and other documents and reports from other departments are, the person in charge will be responsible for stamping them. Payment or accounting shall be made only after the audit is carried out. In order to avoid corruption and other losses, the warehouses or accounts of each department shall be checked at any time and place. In order to accelerate the turnover of funds, the daily cash inventory shall not exceed 50,000 yuan, and the balance shall be deposited in the Dalian County Guandong Bank branch, which not only simplifies the cashier procedures, but also facilitates the general affairs department.

### 大连纺织工厂  重建财务制度克服开支紊乱

    重建财务制度克服开支紊乱
    【本报讯】大连纺织工厂为严格执行经济核算制，克服过去经费开支紊乱现象，重新建立了预决算制和财务制度。该厂过去虽然建立了预决算制，但由于执行的不彻底，流于形式，致使财务制度和预决算，非常紊乱。主要原因是财务负责人以及干部对预决算的重要性认识不足，认为预算和决算是两码事，不一定非要照预算去做，只要实际需要不管有无预算，经厂长批准就给钱。如修建俱乐部订立合同时，未通过财务科，也未做预算，当合同订好后，就跟财务科要经费，如果不给钱，合同已经订好，若给钱又没有预算，没办法为了照顾工作，就得给钱，这就造成了经费开支上的紊乱现象。根据以上缺点，重新规定了财务制度，并建立预算制，经过工业厅核准后由财务科做出表报，通知有关各科，使其照章办事，如有违犯者概不支付款项。间接材料的预决算过去是由保管掌握，每月实际用多少也不做表通知生产技术科，因此生产技术科没有办法来研究为什么质量忽高忽低。各科编制预算的范围也不明确，如各厂的玻璃损坏镶补时，本是总务科负责打在修缮费内，而各厂竟自己编制到间接材料里去了，这就造成了手续紊乱现象。此次明确的规定了各科各场的预算范围，并将每月生产技术科实用物料多少及降低成本的数字，以书面通知有关各科，令其研究原因，决定预决算，以便克服和纠正以上偏向。会计科过去交到财务科的总结表都是在十三、四号，甚至拖到廿几号，此次规定最迟不超过九号。工资劳动组织科，规定保证在当月的二十六号将工资确定完毕交到计算负责同志，有在下旬新来的工友工资推到来月规定。财务科要严格执行审核制度，传票等单据及其他科来的表报，不管怎样忙都由主管人负责盖章。进行审核后始付款或记帐。为避免贪污及其他损失发生，随时随地检查各科的仓库或帐目。并为加速资金周转，每天库存现款不超过五万元，将余款存到大连县关东银行分行，这样不但简便了出纳手续，且便利总务科。
