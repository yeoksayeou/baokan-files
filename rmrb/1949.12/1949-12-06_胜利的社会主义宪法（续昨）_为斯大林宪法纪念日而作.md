　　The Victorious Socialist Constitution (Continued from Yesterday)
    ——Written for the Anniversary of the Stalin Constitution
    By Sudarikov, Translated by Chen Hanzhang

    Scientific creation in the Soviet Union receives the most extensive support from the state. After the war, expenditures on scientific research institutions increased more than threefold compared to 1940.

    The highest leading body of all Soviet science is the Academy of Sciences. Its activities are expanding daily. Currently, the Academy has eight departments and seventy-six scientific research and other scientific institutions.

    The Academy of Sciences has branches and bases in various industrial and cultural centers throughout the country.

    In our country, literature, film, and theater are developing at a rapid pace. Soviet theater, in terms of its ideological level and perfect artistic technique, is unparalleled in the world. There are over seven hundred theaters in the Soviet Union (including fifty children's theaters), and programs are performed in forty different national languages. Soviet film art, although the youngest of all modern art forms, has been recognized worldwide for its direction and production perfection.

    Against the backdrop of cultural and educational development in the Soviet Union, how ugly do those strangely shaped American scholars appear, who spend their days researching such "scientific" topics as: how much does it cost to kill a person in war? For example, a certain American economic "scientist," James Barsalt, uses an unprecedented mockery to prove that the cost of war is very expensive now, but it was much cheaper in ancient times. Barsalt calculates: "In the time of Julius Caesar, the cost of killing a person was nearly 75 cents. In the Napoleonic Wars, this price increased to about three thousand dollars. In the American Civil War, it reached five thousand dollars, and later in the World War it reached twenty-one thousand dollars. Estimates for the value of the current war indicate that this number is currently no less than fifty thousand dollars." After achieving such a great scientific discovery, Barsalt calls for inventing cheap and deadly weapons to reduce the cost of killing a person in war.

    This truly medieval cannibalistic morality is presented under the banner of modern "democratic science."

    Comrade Stalin's words at the Eighteenth All-Union Congress of the Communist Party are being confirmed every day: "Every ordinary Soviet citizen who has thrown off the shackles of capital is ten thousand times higher than any high official abroad who bears the shackles of capitalist slavery." (Stalin's "Problems of Leninism," page 773). And the official representatives of the American ruling group cannot hide from the people the unfortunate results of the development of American "civilization." Not long ago, U.S. Attorney General Clark declared: "Currently, there are millions of children in the United States who are not in school, more than two million children are studying in schools that are not satisfactory, more than three million adults have never attended school, and ten million people have received such an education that they are actually illiterate."

    This is a summary of the development of culture and education in two camps—the reactionary imperialist camp headed by the United States and the progressive and civilized camp headed by the Soviet Union. In capitalist countries and in the Soviet Union, both the fate of culture and all other great social phenomena reflect the fundamental differences in the development of these two worlds—the capitalist world and the socialist world. In the Soviet Union, culture is thriving, while in imperialist countries, culture, like all imperialist systems, is undergoing a difficult period of crisis and decline.

    Our achievements in culture were obtained under the banner of the Stalin Constitution. This constitution greatly enhances people's right to education and to satisfy all their spiritual needs.

    The Stalin Constitution not only consolidates the foundations of socialism in all aspects of economic, political, and cultural life through legislation, but also raises the truly national democracy of the Soviet state system to an unattainable peak.

    At one time, the bourgeoisie of France, the United States, and Britain were proudly self-righteous with their democratic traditions, attributing the hypothetical achievements in the development of democratic political thought to themselves. For example, the French bourgeois group in the eighteenth century considered the "Declaration of the Rights of Man" (1789) to be the peak of democracy in general. But we can still recall the words of a member of the National Assembly, Mirabeau, who said when passing this declaration: "The people should not be lifted to such a high mountain, because they will soon be forced to roll back to the foot of the mountain, where they will encounter stumbling blocks at every step." This is indeed the case. The bourgeoisie needed the slogan of democratic freedom only to attract the masses to their side and use them to fight against feudalism. But as soon as the bourgeoisie felt that power was in their hands, feudalism had lost its previous role, no longer posed any serious danger, and in all aspects formed an agreement with the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie began a slow and unchanging behavior, while abandoning the slogans and oaths it had declared at a certain time.

    As is well known, one of the hypocritical principles of bourgeois democracy is the multi-party system in electing state power organs. Bourgeois state scholars even openly say that if there is party struggle in elections, there is democracy, and if there is no party struggle, there is no democracy. In reality, the reactionary bourgeois parties are only one of the most important tools for directly or indirectly deceiving the masses. Nearly fifty years ago, Engels, in exposing the essence of the two-party system, completely fairly pointed out that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are: "Two gangs of political speculators who gradually seize state power into their hands and exploit this power for the most despicable purpose by extremely dirty means, and the nation is powerless before these two political alliances. These politicians seem to serve the nation, but in reality, they rule it and plunder it." (Marx and Engels Collected Works, Volume 16, Part 2, page 93)

    In the fifty years that have passed since Engels said these words, if there have been any changes in the United States, then it has only gotten worse—regardless of the fact that during this entire period, representatives of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party regularly alternated in the presidential seat in the White House, they are to the same extent servants of the same master—American imperialism. The role of this master is already so obvious that even U.S. President Wilson could not help but admit in his book "The New Freedom" that: "The real masters of the U.S. government are the capitalists and industrialists of the United States."

    American "democracy" is now embodied in the Un-American Activities Investigation Committee, in the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill, in the shameful trial of the leaders of the American Communist Party, whose "crime" is only that they dared to exercise the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly stipulated in the Constitution. Finally, it is embodied in the piratical attack on the Soviet diplomatic representative Gubichev, although his diplomatic activities fully comply with the strict provisions of international law, and he himself has a certificate of diplomatic inviolability that he should enjoy, he was equally delivered to the court. Such facts are so conclusive and irrefutable. Now let's look at the opposite world—some facts of the truly democratic world, that is, the world of unlimited and unconditional democracy.

    Comrade Stalin, in his report on the draft constitution, explained that the democracy consolidated in the Soviet Constitution is not a general, "usual," or "recognized" democracy, but a socialist democracy, which is not limited to formally stipulating the rights of citizens, but focuses on guaranteeing these rights, but focuses on ensuring that all possible facts are realized. In this sense, it should be emphasized that the unity of law and fact in our country is a manifestation in all aspects. But many bourgeois theorists, including Kant, separated form and content and declared that law is something inherently unknowable—these bourgeois theorists attributed legal norms to the purely "ought" realm, to an "ought" world that has nothing in common with the real world.

    Our Soviet laws, especially the Soviet Constitution, are not different from existence, but start from it and are based on it.

    Soviet socialist democracy effectively solves the basic problems of a true democratic system in the interests of the people. It is about the conscious and active participation of all working people and all social citizens in social life (not just pretending), and about the participation of all workers in the management of the state. No other state power except the Soviet power can absorb 1.4 million people to directly exercise state power. In our Soviet Union, these people are the Soviet representatives who actively manage the state. The rest of the citizens have the right to elect their representatives to the state power organs, have the right to listen to their work reports, have the right to make suggestions on improving the activities of all state organs, have the right to propose new legislative decrees or amend existing laws, have only attended open meetings of the Soviets, and open meetings of various committees under the Soviets. All of these give Soviet citizens the right to express their will so that these wills conform to other wills and become the national will of the whole people.

    The Soviet democratic system and its legislative embodiment—the Stalin Constitution—also solve the problem of relations between nationalities in a completely new way, the most complex problem of social life in class society, and a problem that no bourgeois state can completely solve.

    Article 123 of the Constitution clearly stipulates that: Soviet citizens, regardless of nationality or race, are equal in all aspects of economic, state, cultural, and social-political life, as an irrefutable law.

    Any direct or indirect restriction of citizens' rights due to national or racial relations, or conversely, granting citizens direct or indirect privileges, as well as disseminating any ideas of racial or national supremacy, hatred, or contempt, shall be punished by law.

    When we recall (about which we cannot help but recall) the bloody lynching trials so prevalent in the United States, these words in the Stalin Constitution resound loudly and solemnly.

    The Soviet Constitution eliminates inequality between nationalities and consolidates the equal political rights of all nationalities in the Soviet Union in legislation.

    The greatness of Soviet democracy lies in its promotion of huge, material, and cultural forces to achieve the rapid and comprehensive elevation of previously backward nationalities and peoples, and now this effort has been completely successful. The cultural and material life of the past backward nationalities is constantly and increasingly rising.

    Now I will only give one example: in the Kazakh region, which is currently one of the sixteen equal republics, two-thirds of the residents lived a nomadic life that was essentially in the feudal period before the October Revolution, and literate Kazakhs were a rare phenomenon.

    Today, in this Kazakh region, 700,000 people are studying in schools. There are twenty-three universities and ninety secondary specialized schools. One hundred and thirty-four newspapers and four magazines are published in the Kazakh language.

    A conservatory of music, a film studio, an opera house, and a drama theater have been organized there. More than fifty scientific research institutions and its own republic's Academy of Sciences, which combines sixteen colleges, are conducting work there with more than a thousand scientific workers.

    Many significant achievements of Soviet democracy obtained on the basis of the Stalin Constitution are the establishment of the Soviet socio-political and spiritual unity.

    Our Soviet society is spiritually and politically unified. It is an alliance of friendship between two classes—the working class and the peasant class—and this alliance is consolidated by the alliance of these classes with the new Soviet intelligentsia. All of these social groups are building a communist society in a close and creative alliance. The spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people explains the state of political life in that society, explains the conscious civilization development of the people and the high level of that culture, and this level is consistent with the socialist first stage of communist society.

    The basis for the friendship and alliance of the Soviet classes is the consistency of their rights and obligations; the consistency of the right to work, the right to rest, the right to material security in old age and loss of labor ability, the right to education, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom of demonstration and parade.

    Among the greatest rights guaranteed to each citizen by the Stalin Constitution, special mention should be made of the provisions of Article 126 of the Constitution, which states:

    “In conformity with the interests of the working people, and in order to develop the organizational initiative and political activity of the masses of the people, citizens of the U.S.S.R. are guaranteed the right to unite in public organizations: trade unions, cooperative societies, youth organizations, sports and defence organizations, cultural, technical and scientific societies; and the most active and politically-conscious citizens in the ranks of the working class and other sections of the working people unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), which is the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the socialist system and is the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state.”

    Becoming a member of the great Communist Party means becoming the right of the recognized leader and organizer of all victories of the working people. Every Soviet citizen also regards it as a great political trust.

    The ranks of the Communist Party are gradually filled with the best, most advanced, and organized workers, peasants, and Soviet intellectuals.

    Now, there are a total of six million people in its ranks, about ten million young men and women are members of the Lenin Communist Youth League, more than twenty million are members of trade unions, and millions of citizens are organized in voluntary national defense organizations, social organizations, and sports societies.

    And all of this shows that Soviet citizens are actively using the rights stipulated in Article 126 of the Stalin Constitution, are showing an endless source of creative power and energy, and are showing a desire to continuously advance towards new victories of communism under the leadership of the Party.

    The Stalin Constitution has great international significance. It points out to the people of all countries in the world the fastest path to a happy and joyful life, a life that has been freed from all the detestable things brought about by imperialism, and it also enhances the confidence of the people of all countries in their own strength.

    Comrade Stalin said back in 1936, when fascism was just raising its head and establishing its bloody plans: "Now, when the fascist torrent is insulting the socialist movement of the working class and insulting the democratic tendencies of the outstanding people of the civilized world, the new Soviet Constitution will be a public indictment against fascism, demonstrating that socialism and the democratic system are invincible. The new Soviet Constitution will be a spiritual help and practical assistance to all those who are now fighting against fascist barbarity."

    In the thirteen years since the publication of these remarks, the world has more than once been convinced of the truth of Stalin's remarks.

    The Soviet armed forces crushed German fascism and made it prostrate on the ground, and overthrew fascist Japan.

    Fulfilling its great liberation mission, the Soviet army helped the nations of the West and the East to lift the shackles of fascism and gave the possibility to independently solve their problems of life and political and social organization. The nations of the liberated countries have found the only correct path—they have established people's democratic systems in their own countries and are now gathering strength to gradually transition to socialism.

    In the major and difficult task of formulating the fundamental laws of these countries—the constitution—the Stalin Constitution has become an inspiring example to be followed.

    The proclamation of the People's Republic of China in the East and the emergence of the German Democratic Republic in the West are the most significant international events in recent times.

    Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and guided by its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have won victory in the War of Liberation and the people's democratic revolution, and are beginning to organize peaceful construction in order to consolidate the political and economic system and national culture. In this work of their own construction, they will rely on the experience of the Soviet Union, as well as the experience of the people's democratic countries in the West.

    The principles of Soviet society and state organization, so clearly and profoundly formulated in the Stalin Constitution, help our fighting brothers—the Chinese people—to find the correct solution to the complex problems of social life in their own country.

    The people of the Soviet Union sincerely and unselfishly hope to help the brotherly Chinese people and pass on their experience to him.

    The banner of the Stalin Constitution is flying over the land of the Soviet Union, calling on the people of all countries in the world to move towards happiness and prosperity.

    Comrade Stalin said that our Constitution will be such a document that proves that the fact that millions of upright people in many capitalist countries have once dreamed or continue to dream of has been realized in the Soviet Union.

    It—the Soviet Constitution—is such a document that proves that the fact that has been realized in the Soviet Union can be fully realized in other countries as well under the voluntary will of the people of all countries.

　　胜利的社会主义宪法（续昨）
    ——为斯大林宪法纪念日而作
    苏达里可夫  著  陈汉章  译
    科学创作在苏联是受到国家最广泛的支持。在战争以后，对于科学研究机关的支出，比较一九四○年增加了三倍以上。
    整个苏维埃科学的最高首脑机关是科学院。它的活动每天在扩大中，目前，在科学院的机构中设有八个部，七十六个科学研究及其他科学机关。
    科学院在国内各工业和文化中心设有分院和根据地。
    在我们国家里，文学、电影、戏剧正以迅速的步调在发展着。苏维埃戏剧按其思想水准和完美的艺术技巧，是世界上无与伦比的。在苏联共有七百个以上剧院（其中有五十个儿童剧院），在苏联是用四十种不同民族的语言来上演节目的。苏维埃电影艺术，虽然是一切现代艺术样式中最年青的一种，但已经在其方向性和制作的完美程度上为全世界所公认。
    在苏联文化和教育发展衬托下，那些奇形怪状的美国学者显得是多么丑恶，他们把自己的日子消磨在研究这样的一些“科学”题目，如：在战争中杀一个人要化多少本钱，例如有某一个美国经济“学家”詹姆士·巴萨尔特，用一种前所未闻的揶揄来证明现在战争的代价是很贵的，在古代是便宜多了。巴萨尔这样计算着：“在尤里·凯撒时代杀一个人的代价将近七十五角钱。在拿破仑战争时代，这种价格增加到大约三千元左右，在美国内战时代达到了五千元，而后来在世界大战中则达到二万一千元，对现在这一次战争价值的估计表明出，这种数字在目前是不低于五万元。”巴萨尔在达到了这样巨大的科学发现后，就来号召用发明廉价的，同时也是易于致命的杀人武器，来减低在战争中杀死一个人的成本。
    这种真正中世纪的吃人道德，是在现代“民主科学”的旗帜下呈现出来了。
    斯大林同志在第十八次全苏联共产党代表大会所说的话，是每天在得到证实：“每一个摆脱了资本枷锁的最平常苏维埃公民，都比国外任何一个背着资本主义奴隶枷锁的大官显宦高出万万。”（斯大林著列宁主义问题七七三页）。而那些美国统治集团的官方代表人物，是不能对人民掩盖住美国“文明”发展底不幸结果的，不久前美国司法部长克拉克宣称：“目前在美国共计有数百万儿童没有入学，二百万以上的儿童在一些不能使人满意的学校里念书，有三百万成年人从来也没有进过学校，而有一千万人却受到那样的教育，甚至于他们在实际上还是一些文盲。”
    这就是文化和教育在两个阵营——在美国为首的帝国主义反动阵营和以苏联为首的进步和文明阵营里的若干发展总结。在资本主义各国和在苏联，无论是文化的命运，无论是其他各种巨大的社会现象，都反映出这两个世界——资本主义世界和社会主义世界——发展中的根本差别。在苏联文化是蓬勃地发展着，而在帝国主义各国，文化是和一切帝国主义的制度一样，正在经受着危机和衰落的艰难时期。
    我们在文化方面的成绩，是在斯大林宪法的旗帜下获得的。这个宪法是大大提高了人的受教育的权利和满足其一切精神需要的权利。
    斯大林宪法不仅在经济的、政治的、文化的生活各方面，用立法的方法巩固了社会主义的基础，它同时还把苏维埃国家制度底真正全民的民主主义提高到不可攀达的顶峰。
    在某个时期，法国、美国、英国的资产阶级曾以其民主传统而傲然不可一世，把民主政治思想发展中的假设功勋归于自己。例如十八世纪的法兰西资产阶级集团曾认为“人权宣言”（一七八九年）一般地是民主底高峰。但是我们还能够想起国民议会的一个议员密路安的话来，他在通过这一宣言时曾经说过：“不应该把人民捧到那么高的山上去，因为他很快将被迫重新滚到山脚下去，而在那里他每走一步将会碰上绊脚石”。这在事实上也是如此的。资产阶级之所以需要民主的自由口号，仅仅是为了要吸引群众到自己方面来，利用他们来进行反封建主义的斗争。但只要资产阶级一感觉到政权已在其手中，封建主义已失去其先前的作用，不再表现某些严重的危险，而在各方面来与资产阶级成立协定，那么资产阶级就开始了一种缓慢而不变的行为，同时背弃他在某时所宣布的口号和许出的誓言。
    众所周知，虚伪的资产阶级民主主义原则之一，就是在选举国家政权机关时的多党制度。资产阶级的国家学者还这样公然说，如果在选举中有党派斗争，这就有民主，如果没有党派斗争，这就没有民主。而在实际上，资产阶级的反动政党仅仅是直接或间接欺骗群众的最重要的工具之一。将近五十年以前，恩格斯在揭露两党制度的本质时完全公平地指出：民主党与共和党这是：“两个政治投机分子的匪团，他们逐步地把国家政权掌握到自己底手里，并且为了一个最卑鄙的目的用极卑污的手段来剥削这个政权，而在这两大政客同盟之前民族是无力的。这些政客仿佛服务于民族，实际上是统治它而且抢夺它的。”（马恩全集第十六卷，第二部，第九十三页）
    从恩格斯说了这些话以后，所经过的五十年内，如果说在美国已有了些什么变化的话，那么只是变得更坏了，——别看在全部这一个时期内民主党和共和党的代表们彼此定期交替着白宫中的总统席位，在同样的程度上都是同一个主人——美国帝国主义——底仆役。这种主人底作用是已经这样明显，甚至美国总统威尔逊在其“新自由”书中曾不能不承认说：“美国政府底真正的主人是美国的资本家和工业家。”
    美国现在的“民主”是体现在反美活动调查委员会中，在塔虎特哈特莱反劳工法案中，在对于美国共产党底领袖的可耻审判中，而这些领袖们所犯的“罪”只是他们敢于利用宪法上规定的言论自由、出版自由与集会自由的权利。最后是体现在对于苏联外交代表古贝雪夫的强盗式的袭击中，虽然他底外交活动完全适合于国际法上严格的规定，他本身也有外交上应享有不可侵犯权利的证明书，而他一样地被交付到法院。象这样一个一个的事实，是多么确凿和不可辩驳呀。现在我们来看一看正相反的世界—真正民主的即无限制和无条件的民主世界底若干事实。
    斯大林同志在其论宪法草案的报告中说明这个宪法的特点时指出，在苏联宪法中所巩固的民主主义，并不是一般“通常的”、“公认的”民主主义，而是社会主义的民主主义，这种民主主义不以形式上规定公民的权利为限，而是注重于保障这些权利的问题，而是注重于所有可能事实实现的保证。在这个意义上应当强调在我们国家里法律和事实的统一性表现，这就是一种现象各方面底表现。但是很多资产阶级的理论家，其中包括康德却曾把形式和内容分离开来，并宣布说，法律乃是一种本身不可认识的东西——这些资产阶级的理论家把法律规范归入纯粹的当然领域，归于与现实世界没有什么共同的当然世界。
    我们苏联法律其中尤其是苏联宪法，它们不是与存在毫无差别的，而是由它作出发点，也以它作基础的。
    苏联社会主义的民主是有效地，且在人民利益方面解决了真正的民主制度的基本问题，是关于全体劳动人民全体社会公民实际地（而不是装样子的参加社会生活底自觉和积极）的建设问题，是关于所有劳动者参加管理国家的问题，除苏维埃政权外没有什么别的国家政权能够吸收一百四十万人去直接行使国家的职权，在我们苏联这些人数就是积极地管理国家的苏维埃代表，其余的公民都有权选举自己底代表到国家政权机关中去，有权听取他们的工作报告，有权提出关于改善一切国家机关活动的建议，有权提出关于颁发新立法法令或修改现行法令的建议，有仅参加苏维埃的公开会议，以及苏维埃所辖各种委员会的公开会议。所有这些都给与苏联公民来表示自己的意志，以便这些意志与其他一些意志相符合而成为全民的国家的意志。
    苏维埃民主制度及其立法的体现——斯大林宪法又用完全新的方法解决了民族间的关系问题，阶级社会的社会生活底一个最复杂的问题，而这个问题是任何一个资产阶级国家所不能完全解决的。
    在宪法一二三条极其明显地规定：苏联公民不分民族及种族，在经济的、国家的、文化的和社会——政治的生活各方面，一律平等，是为确定不移之法律。
    凡因民族或种族关系对公民权利作任何直接或间接限制，或者相反，赋予公民以直接或间接特权，以及散布任何种族或民族独尊、仇恨或轻蔑之思想，均依法律惩罚之。
    当我们想起（关于这个我们不能不想起的）在美国如此盛行的血腥的林察审判时，斯大林宪法里的这些话是在高高地、庄严地振响着。
    苏维埃宪法消灭了民族间的不平等并在立法上巩固了苏联各族人民底平等的政治权利。
    苏维埃的民主的伟大是在它推动了巨大的、物质上的、文化上的力量来实现迅速地、全面地提高以前落后的民族和人民，而现在这种努力已经完全成功了。过去的落后民族底文化和物质生活正在不断地和日益上升地高涨着。
    现在我只举一个例子，在那个目前是十六个平权共和国之一的卡察赫地方，在十月革命以前三分之二的居民，却过着在本质上是封建时期的游牧式的生活，识字的卡察克人是很少见的现象。
    而现今在这个卡查赫地方有七十万人在学校里上学。该处有二十三个高等学校九十个中等专门学校，用卡查赫语文出版着一百三十四种报纸和四种杂志。
    在那里组织了音乐院，电影制片厂、歌剧院和话剧院。五十个以上的科学研究机关和自己的共和国的科学院，这个科学院结合了十六个学院，在它那里有一千个以上的科学工作者在进行工作。
    在斯大林宪法底基础上所获得的苏维埃民主主义的不少显著成果，就是苏维埃社会政治上、精神上的统一底建立。
    我们苏维埃社会在精神上和政治上是一致的。它是两个阶级——工人阶级和农民阶级的友谊联盟，而这个联盟，并为这些阶级之与新的苏维埃知识分子的联盟所巩固。所有这些社会集团，在紧密创造的联盟下建设着共产主义社会。苏维埃人民精神、政治的统一，是说明着那种社会的政治生活的状况，是说明着人民底文明发展自觉和文化底那种高度水准，而这种水准是与共产主义社会第一阶段的社会主义相适应的。
    在苏联各阶级间的友谊和联盟结合基础，是它们的权利和义务底一致性；工作权、休息权、年老和丧失劳动能力时享受物质保障权、受教育权、思想自由、言论自由、出版自由、集会结社自由和游行示威自由底一致性。
    斯大林宪法对于每个公民所保障的最大权利中，特别是应当指出宪法的第一二六条的规定，在这个条文里写着：
    “为适合劳动者利益，并发展民众之组织自动性及政治积极性起见，保障苏联公民有权结合于各种社会团体，职工会，合作团体，青年组织，体育和国防组织，文化技术及科学会社；而工人阶级及劳动者其他阶层中最积极最觉悟之公民则结合于全联盟共产党（布尔什维克）即劳动者为巩固及发展社会主义制度而奋斗之先锋队，劳动者所有一切社会组织及国家组织之领导核心。”
    成为伟大的共产党党员即成为劳动者一切胜利底公认的领袖和组织者的权利。每一个苏联公民同时还把它看作是政治上的一种极大的信任。
    共产党的队伍是由最优秀的，最前进的有组织的工人阶级，农民和苏维埃的知识分子所逐渐充实着。
    现在在它的队伍里，共有六百万人，约有一千万男女青年是列宁共产主义青年团团员，二千万人以上的是职工联合会的会员，数百万公民则组织于自愿的国防组织、社会组织和体育会社之中。
    而所有这一切是表明，苏联的公民正在积极地利用着斯大林宪法第一百二十六条所规定的权利，正在表现出创造力量和精力的无穷的源泉，以及在党的领导下不断地向共产主义的新的胜利前进的愿望。
    斯大林宪法是具有巨大的国际意义，它向全世界各族人民指出了一条走向幸福愉快的最快的生活之路，这种生活是已经摆脱了全部为帝国主义所带来的可厌的东西，它同时并提高着各族人民对于自己力量的信心。
    斯大林同志还在一九三六年，当法西斯主义还是刚刚抬起头来和建立起自己底血腥计划的时候说道：“现在，当法西斯浊流污辱着工人阶级底社会主义运动，污辱着文明世界优秀人士的民主主义趋向时，苏联新宪法将是一张反对法西斯主义的公诉书，说明社会主义与民主制度是不可战胜的。苏联新宪法对于所有现今进行反法西斯野蛮暴行的斗争的人士，将是一种精神上的帮助和实际的助力。”
    由发表这些言论的时候起，在以往的十三年中，全世界不止一次地信服了斯大林言论的真理。
    苏联底武装力量击溃了德国底法西斯主义，并且使它俯伏在地，推翻了法西斯底日本。
    完成着自己的伟大的解放使命，苏联军队帮助了西方和东方各民族解除法西斯底束缚，并给与可能独立地解决自己生活上和政治的和社会的组织问题。被解放各国家底各民族找到了唯一正确的道路—他们已经在自己国家里建立了人民民主制度，并且现时正在集合力量以便逐步过渡到社会主义。
    在制定这些国家底根本法—宪法底重大和艰巨的事业中，斯大林宪法已经成为可以取法的足资鼓舞的范例。
    东方中华人民共和国底宣告成立和西方德意志民主共和国底产生，都是最近时期最有重大意义的国际事件。
    现在中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，受自己伟大领袖毛泽东同志底引导在解放战争和人民民主革命中获得了胜利，正在开始组织着和平的建设，以期巩固政治、经济制度和民族文化。在这种自己建设的工作中，他们将依靠苏联的经验，以及西方人民民主国家的经验。
    苏联社会和国家组织的原则，这样明显而深刻地在斯大林宪法里制定出来，它们帮助着我们斗争的弟兄们——中国人民来找到自己国家内社会生活复杂问题的正确解决。
    苏联底人们诚恳无私地充满着希望，来帮助弟兄一样的中国人民，把自己的经验传达给他。
    斯大林宪法的旗帜，飘扬在苏联的土地上，它召换着全世界各族人民走向幸福和繁荣。
    斯大林同志说，我们的宪法将是这样的一个文件，它证明着许多资本主义国家里千百万正直人士所曾经幻想或继续幻想底那个事实，已经在苏联实现了。
    它——苏联宪法——是这样的一个文件，它证明着在苏联已经实现了的那个事实，是完全可以在各族人民志愿之下也在其他国家实现。
