Protecting the Property of the Two Airlines and the Resources Committee

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 21st: Hong Kong News: The struggle of the employees of China National Aviation Corporation, Central Air Transport Corporation, and the former Resources Committee who have revolted to protect property has received widespread support from Hong Kong compatriots. Multiple conspiracies of the Kuomintang reactionaries to lure and divide have been resolutely shattered by the revolting employees who have been enthusiastically supported and encouraged. Although the materials of the three institutions in Hong Kong have been temporarily frozen by the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong compatriots do not allow this huge property belonging to the people's motherland to be damaged in any way. When the Kuomintang reactionaries filed a complaint in the British court, the vice-chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions immediately issued a statement stating that the British government should respect and protect the property of the two airlines and the Resources Committee belonging to the Chinese people. Following the establishment of a support committee for the revolting employees by the Federation of Trade Unions, more than 2,000 representatives from 46 trade unions held a grand consolation meeting for the revolting employees. On the evening of the 10th, more than 30 trade union opera troupes jointly held a consolation party. More than 30 representatives from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association and teachers and students from five labor schools also presented flags of consolation to the revolting personnel. On the 2nd of this month, dozens of trade unions representing 900,000 workers jointly wrote to the revolting employees, saying that they have a strong motherland as their backing and the support of all Hong Kong compatriots, encouraging them to persevere in their struggle. 177 people from the literary and drama circles also wrote separately to the revolting employees, guaranteeing: "We must support you and help your struggle to achieve victory." 72 business leaders called on all Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots to actively support the revolting employees. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Civil Aviation Workers' Union provided them with advice on the struggle. Two dockworkers' unions have repeatedly stated that they will be their staunch supporters. In addition, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Postal Workers' Union, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Carpenters' General Union, 37 youth groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon that were refused registration by the Hong Kong government, and others also sent letters of condolence. The revolting employees, who were greatly encouraged, were in high spirits and unanimously pledged: "No matter how the situation evolves, our unity will only become more and more consolidated, and our will will only become more and more firm." "We must unite to the end, persevere in the struggle to the end, and achieve the glorious task of protecting the property and returning it to the people."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 21st: Hong Kong News: All the Chinese pilots, radio operators, and mechanics, totaling more than 200 people, of the Kuomintang Civil Aviation Administration Air Transport Corps, headed by American invasion element Chennault, are unwilling to accompany Chennault to escape to Taiwan to die, and have announced a strike, demanding dismissal, and making three demands. On the 15th of this month, Chennault prepared to evacuate all 16 aircraft remaining in Hong Kong to Taiwan, which was resolutely opposed by more than 40 pilots and radio operators of the company, who announced a strike, and all Chinese employees responded immediately and took unified action. On the 16th, Chennault attempted to escape to Taiwan by plane, but the striking employees surrounded him at Kai Tak Airport, unanimously expressing their refusal to accompany him to Taiwan, demanding dismissal, and making three demands: (1) payment of year-end bonuses; (2) payment of six months' severance pay; (3) payment of travel expenses for returning home. Chennault not only completely refused but also colluded with more than 100 armed police of the Hong Kong government to suppress the employees, arresting four employees, and the passes of some employees to enter the airport were confiscated, while Chennault took the opportunity to fly away. The striking employees immediately prevented the company's remaining four aircraft from leaving Hong Kong, and sent representatives to negotiate and protest with the British authorities in Hong Kong, and also issued a "Statement on Striving to Guarantee Livelihood and Against Persecution," demanding that Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots provide righteous support, and protesting against the Hong Kong British government's assistance to Chennault in persecuting employees, demanding the immediate release of the arrested personnel. After this incident occurred, the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon expressed indignation at Chennault's and the Hong Kong British government's unreasonable actions. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Civil Aviation Workers' General Union specifically issued a protest letter, pointing out that the actions of all the Chinese employees of the Air Transport Corps in recognizing the overall situation, refusing to relocate to Taiwan, and demanding the payment of severance pay, etc., are completely reasonable, and that the Hong Kong government's measures are actions that assist the capitalists in oppressing labor and infringing upon human rights and freedom.

　　港九工人青年文艺界工商界
    全力支持起义员工
    “民航队”华籍员工反对迁台陈纳德勾结英帝横肆迫害
    【新华社广州二十一日电】香港消息：中国、中央两航空公司及前资源委员会起义员工的护产斗争，受到香港同胞普遍的支援。国民党反动派进行的利诱分化的多次阴谋，都被受到热烈支援和鼓舞的起义员工坚决粉碎。现三机构存港物资虽被香港政府暂时冻结，但香港同胞不允许这属于人民祖国的庞大财产受到任何损害。国民党反动派投拆英法庭时，工联会副主席立即发表声明表示：英国政府应尊重和保护这属于中国人民的两航及资委会的财产。继工联会成立对起义员工的支援委员会后，四十六个工会代表二千余人举行了对起义员工的盛大的慰问会，十日晚三十多个工会歌剧团又联合举行慰问晚会。先后向起义人员慰问献旗的还有港九劳工教育促进会所属的三十余位代表和五间劳校的师生等。本月二日，代表着九十万工人的几十个工会联合致书起义员工说：他们有着强大的祖国为后盾，和全港同胞的支援，勉励他们坚持斗争。文艺、戏剧界一百七十七人也分别致函向起义员工保证：“我们一定要支持你们，帮助你们的斗争达到胜利。”七十二个工商界领袖号召港九全体同胞积极支持起义员工。港九民航工会向他们提供斗争的意见。两个船坞工会一再向他们申言誓为后盾。此外，港九邮务工会，港九木匠总工会，港九三十七个被香港政府拒绝登记的青年团体等也纷纷致函慰问。受到热烈鼓舞的起义员工情绪非常高涨，一致提出保证说：“事件不论如何演变，我们的团结只有越来越巩固，意志只有越来越坚定。”“我们要团结到底，坚持斗争到底，达到保产还民的光荣任务。”
    【新华社广州二十一日电】香港消息：美国侵华分子陈纳德所主持的国民党民航局空运大队在港全部华籍机师、报务员和机械员共二百余人，不愿陪同陈纳德迁逃台湾送死，宣布罢工，要求遣散，并提出三项要求。本月十五日，陈纳德准备将留港的十六架飞机全部撤逃台湾，遭到该公司四十余机师和报务员的坚决反对，宣布罢工，全体华籍员工立予响应，并采一致行动。十六日陈纳德企图乘机逃台，罢工员工乃在启德机场将他包围，一致表示拒绝随同迁台，要求遣散，并提出：（一）发给年终红利；（二）发给六个月遣散费；（三）发给还乡旅费等三项要求。陈纳德不但完全拒绝，而且勾结了香港政府的武装警察百余人到场镇压，捕去员工四人，一部员工进入机场的通行证被扣，陈则乘机飞逃。罢工员工继即阻止该公司所余四架飞机离港，并派代表向香港英国当局交涉和抗议，另外发表了“争取保障生活及对迫害”的声明，要求港九同胞予以正义的支援，并抗议香港英政府协助陈纳德迫害员工，要求立即释放被捕人员。此事发生后，港九中国人民对陈纳德及香港英政府的无理举动，均表愤慨。港九民用航空事业职工总会特发表抗议书，指出空运队全体华籍员工认清整个局势，拒绝迁台和要求发给遣散费等的行动是完全合理的，香港政府的措施是协助资方压迫劳工并损害人权自由的举动。
