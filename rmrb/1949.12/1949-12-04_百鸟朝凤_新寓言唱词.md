The north wind blows and snowflakes flutter, the snowflakes fall but the ice doesn't melt. The wealthy landlords sit comfortably at home, with coal fires and braziers enjoying leisure; the laboring peasants suffer from the cold, poor homes and broken eaves have no firewood to burn; wild animals burrow into their caves, birds chirp and return to their nests; there is a little parakeet with green feathers and a red beak, spreading its wings and flying high into the sky, flying and chirping, unafraid of freezing its skin or losing its feathers. If you ask where the parakeet is going? Why is it leaving its nest in the cold and snowy weather? It is because its mother, the old parakeet, is injured and sick, suffering greatly. One day the old parakeet flew into the deep mountains, and encountered the wild bird, the old owl. The old owl guarded the entrance to the deep mountains, glaring with its eyes and bristling its feathers, it often eats birds and human corpses, wanting to show off its "heroism" in the deep mountains. The old parakeet wanted to enter the deep mountains, but the owl blocked its way and roared: I ask you what kind of bird you are? How dare you scratch an itch on a tiger's head! The old parakeet stepped forward to reason, scolding the tyrannical old owl: This deep mountain is a place for hundreds of birds to fly, where birds freely forage and build nests, you dominate the mountain entrance and act fiercely, who can forgive you for doing unjust things! The old owl, hearing this, became angry, and pounced to grab the old parakeet's tail feathers. The old parakeet rolled down the cliff, breaking its skin and tearing off its feathers, returning to its nest injured, unable to get better and full of resentment. Sick in its nest, without food or drink, it was dizzy and feverish from hunger. The little parakeet shed tears, wanting to go to the deep mountains to find food and gather herbs. The old parakeet spoke, calling the little parakeet: The wind outside is strong and the snowflakes are fluttering, my child is young and lacks strength, flying over mountains and ridges with insufficient skill, if you go to the deep mountains to find food, you might encounter the wild bird, the old owl, or even poisonous snakes and wild beasts, inevitably suffering harm and disaster! The little parakeet replied to its mother: Your child is not afraid of the wind and fluttering snowflakes, if I encounter wild insects or birds, I will break their bones and pull out their feathers! The little parakeet finished speaking, flapping its wings and flying over the treetops, flying thousands of miles, pushing through the clouds and looking down: it saw the vast expanse of heaven and earth, all in one piece, like white waves rolling in the sea, tree branches hanging with white snow flowers, green mountains like white cloth wrapping them, east, west, north, and south, no roads could be seen, up, down, and all around, snowflakes falling one after another. The little parakeet watched for a while, kicked off and landed on a tall treetop, landing on the treetop and thinking back, remembering its mother sick in the nest, suffering greatly, where in this deep mountain forest could it find food? The ice and snow covered everything, no place to find herbs. The little parakeet was thinking of a plan, when a poisonous snake crawled out from behind and bit it. The poisonous snake's teeth were sharp and fierce, biting the little parakeet so painfully that it squeaked and squeaked, the fresh blood on its legs rolled outwards, and a tuft of feathers was torn from its belly. The little parakeet shook its head and folded its wings, trying to escape, but the poisonous snake bit it tightly. While it was struggling and unable to break free, the old owl flew from the east. The owl, seeing meat, felt itchy in its heart, and bit the little parakeet's waist. The owl and the poisonous snake both exerted force, tearing the little parakeet apart with a ripping sound. The poisonous snake and the owl ate their fill, alarming the old parakeet sick and sleeping in its nest. The old parakeet was thinking of the little parakeet: Why haven't I seen my child return to the nest? Watching the sun set in the west and the sky turn dark, the howling north wind was like the cries of ghosts and wolves; could it be that my child encountered a poisonous snake? Could it be that my child encountered an owl? Could it be that the ice and snow filled the sky and it lost its way? Could it be that my child really unfortunately met with disaster? The old parakeet thought and thought, unable to rest assured, gritting its teeth and enduring the pain, it left the nest, flying a while and resting a while, its stomach hungry and its heart anxious, flying over thousands of mountains and rivers, unable to find its little hero, flying until the old parakeet was exhausted, sweat soaking through its body and feathers. Finally, it landed on a large tree, landing on a branch, landing on the tree and looking for its child, my child, where did you go to find food and gather herbs? Unable to hear a sound or see a face, calling out without a response, looking at the sky, which was so high. The old parakeet shed tears of sorrow, suddenly hearing a ripping sound behind it, climbing up the branch. The old parakeet turned around to look, only seeing a poisonous snake crawling upwards, the old parakeet was shocked, seeing blood on the snake's mouth with a tuft of feathers sticking to it, thinking that it had harmed its child, it had to skin it and tear its tendons to relieve this hatred. The old parakeet thought of itself being sick, unable to defeat the poisonous snake and throwing away its life for nothing, it was better to unite the strength of hundreds of birds, and then it would be not too late to avenge its hatred. The old parakeet, having thought this, flew up, and in an instant, flew back to its old nest. In the nest, it was dark and black, with a bird lying there, which was the tyrannical old owl. The old owl had bitten the little parakeet to death, and had also taken over the nest, wanting to wipe out its entire family. At this time, the old parakeet could not return home, its heart filled with hatred like a raging fire. It found the old eagle and magpie to discuss, telling them the whole story and the consequences. The magpie, hearing this, opened its mouth and shouted: Curse the evil wild bird, the old owl, it and the poisonous snake are in cahoots, doing evil and harming others, enjoying themselves. In my opinion, we must act immediately, bite the poisonous snake to death and take back your old nest! The old eagle said: This matter must be considered more carefully, we cannot underestimate the poisonous snake and the old owl, they have lived in the mountain forest for a long time, like the roots of a large tree, firmly rooted, the owl's hooked beak is like a knife and sword, and there are thousands of poisonous snakes in the mountains. In my opinion, uniting the strength of hundreds of birds is the best way, and asking the phoenix for its high wisdom, the phoenix lives in the high mountain forest, where there are flowers everywhere and the grass is always green, where the fruits hang full on the trees, and where hundreds of birds sing and chirp, all the birds respect the phoenix as their leader, clearing the mountains of poisonous snakes and owls, if we go to report to it, it will surely call on hundreds of birds to avenge you. The old parakeet and the magpie both said good, good, good, the three of them spread their wings and flew high into the sky, flying to the northwest mountain forest, where they saw the phoenix and told it the whole story. The phoenix, hearing this, issued an order, and in an instant, hundreds of birds gathered and were mobilized, three cannon shots were fired under the mountain forest, the commander of the army was the great roc eagle. The commander ascended the platform and shouted, calling on hundreds of birds to quickly leave their nests. As they spoke, the birds arrived, a group of sparrows came from the due east, the little jade bird walked at the front, followed by the little wren, the warbler bird had beautiful feathers, and the skylark had a long tail, the fish eagle flew over thousands of miles of water, the peng bird soared ten thousand feet high, the little yellow bird chirped as it flew, and the mandarin ducks were graceful. The eastern birds had just passed the mountain forest, when a group of birds from the due south arrived: a group of reed warblers came, singing loudly, a group of *mazi liu* came, each with bulging eyes, a group of quail birds, chirping with a very loud voice, a group of white gulls, cutting through the air like drifting on the water, geese flying quickly in formation, closely followed by *lei chui*. Not to mention the birds coming to enter the mountain forest, a group of birds from the due north also arrived: the *bogu* bird danced the hoe dance, and the *hongdianke* sang a good song about speeding up production. At the front was *bangsheng* the flower monk, and the *zhuji* chicken happily blew the *yunxiao*, the little sparrow played the *pangping chai*, the lark sang really skillfully, the woodpecker danced the *yangge*, and the *luci* played the drums really well, followed by a group of singer parakeets, their feathers shining brightly. Not to mention the birds coming to play music, a group of birds from the due west also arrived: at the front was the blue ant blowing the horn, the peacock hastily waved the flag, the turtle dove walked without delay, the old stork beat the war drum, the swallows and crows transported bullets, the little pigeons brought messages of comfort, the ducks carried clear spring water, and the *chibei* cooed loudly, the *huohulu* carried a sword, and the *maizhazha* carried a gun over its eyebrows, the harrier spread its wings to scout the way, and the rabbit hawk used its strength to carry supplies, white sparrows and swallows stood in formation, and the young storks stood at the end, the old eagle was the captain, and the magpie shouted slogans. At this time, hundreds of birds swore an oath, to exterminate the poisonous snakes and owls, the large army spread out for three thousand miles, the bugle sounded and the war drums beat, the birds' wings covered the sky and the earth, and each one bravely advanced as a hero. They rushed to the deep mountain entrance, surrounding the deep mountain again and again, immediately capturing the old poisonous snake, and then capturing the old owl, the little owls and little poisonous snakes all surrendered, and naturally, a lenient policy was used to spare them, hundreds of birds gathered to celebrate the great victory, and all cheered that the phoenix was wise and had good policies! Having told the story of hundreds of birds worshipping the phoenix, I advise you all to learn more and remember it well!

　　百鸟朝凤　新寓言唱词
    王亚平
    北风吹来雪花飘，雪花落地冰不消。有钱的地主家中坐，煤火炭炉多逍遥；劳动的农民受寒苦，穷家破檐没柴烧；野兽钻进洞穴去，鸟雀纷纷回窝巢；有一只小鹦哥绿毛红嘴，展开翅膀飞的冲天高，一边飞来一边叫，他不怕冻破了皮肤冻掉了毛。要问鹦哥何处去？为什么寒雪冷天出窝巢？只因为它的母亲老鹦哥，受伤得病苦难熬。那一天老鹦哥飞到深山去，碰到了野鸟老鸱枭，老鸱枭把住深山口，瞪着眼睛咋着毛，它常吃雀鸟和死人肉，想在深山逞“英豪”。老鹦哥要把深山进，鸱枭挡住去路乱咆啸：我问你是什么鸟？好胆大敢到老虎头上把痒痒搔！老鹦哥上前去讲理，骂一声横行霸道的老鸱枭：“这深山本是百鸟飞翔地，百鸟自由打食觅窝巢，你霸占山口逞凶恶，做事不正谁能把你饶！”老鸱枭听罢面带怒，一扑抓住老鹦哥的尾巴梢，老鹦哥滚倒山崖上，摔破了皮肉撕掉了毛，带伤回到窝巢去，一病不起恨难消，病在窝里没吃又没喝，直饿得眼晕心发烧。小鹦哥一边流眼泪，要上深山打食采药草。老鹦哥开言把小鹦哥叫：“外边的风大雪花飘，我儿年轻力气小，飞山越岭技术不高，你若深山把食打，恐怕你碰到野鸟老鸱枭，再不然碰到毒蛇和猛兽，难免受害把祸遭！”小鹦哥回言把母亲叫：“为儿不怕风吹雪花飘，要是碰见野虫鸟，我咬断它的筋骨拔掉它的毛！”小鹦哥说罢扑打着翅，一飞冲过树林梢，一翅飞到千里外，拨着云脚往下瞧：它看见天地茫茫成一片，好一似海水白浪滚滔滔，树枝挂着白花雪，青山好似白布包，东西南北看不见路，上下四方雪花纷纷向下飘。小鹦哥观看一会，翅一蹬落到了高树梢，落在树梢回头想，想起它母亲病在窝里苦难熬，这深山大林那里找食物？冰雪遮盖无处寻药草。小鹦哥正在想主意，从背后爬出一只毒蛇把它咬住了，那毒蛇牙齿尖又狠，直咬得小鹦哥痛苦难忍吱＠＠，腿上的鲜血向外滚，肚皮上撕掉了一撮毛。小鹦哥摇头折翅想逃走，那毒蛇把它咬的紧又牢，正在挣扎难分手，从东边飞来老鸱枭，鸱枭见肉心发痒，一嘴咬住小鹦哥的腰，鸱枭毒蛇两边一用力，撕啦啦把小鹦哥裂开了。毒蛇鸱枭吃了一顿饱，惊动了老鹦哥病睡在窝巢，老鹦哥正把小鹦哥来思念：为啥不见我儿回窝巢？眼看着日落西山天地黑，呼啦啦的北风象鬼哭狼号；莫非我儿遇毒蛇？莫非我儿遇鸱枭？莫非冰雪满天迷了路？莫非我儿真的不幸把祸遭？老鹦哥想来想去放心不下，咬牙忍痛出窝巢，飞一阵来歇一阵，肚里饥饿心发焦，飞过千山和万水，寻不见他儿小英豪，直飞的老鹦哥心疲力又尽，汗水淋淋湿透了的身体和羽毛。到后来落到一棵大树上，落在大树一枝条，落在树上把儿望，我的儿你到那里找食采药草？听不到声音见不到面，呼地不应，望天天又高。老鹦哥流下了伤心泪，忽听得背后撕拉拉拉爬上树枝梢，老鹦哥回头来观看，只看见一条毒蛇向上爬来向上绕，老鹦哥吓得心惊跳，看毒蛇嘴上有血粘着一撮毛，想是她把我的小儿害，要把它扒皮抽筋此恨才能消。老鹦哥想起自己身带病，战不胜毒蛇白送命一条，还不如联合百鸟力量大，到那时报仇雪恨晚不了。老鹦哥想罢飞腾起，刹时间飞回自己老窝巢，窝巢里黑布塔塔卧着一只鸟，那原是横行霸道的老鸱枭。老鸱枭咬死小鹦哥，又霸占窝巢想把它全家都灭消，到这时老鹦哥有家归不得，心里仇恨象烈火熊熊烧。它找到老鹰喜鹊来商议，把前情和后果说了一遭，喜鹊听罢开言叫：“骂声恶霸野鸟老鸱枭，它和毒蛇成一伙，作恶为害乐逍遥，依我看，咱们马上要动手，咬死毒蛇夺回你的老窝巢！”老鹰说：“这事还得多考虑，不能轻看毒蛇老鸱枭，它们盘居山林地，好似大树根儿扎的牢，鸱枭钩嘴似刀剑，毒蛇满山千万条。依我看联合百鸟力量大，请求凤凰智谋高，凤凰住在高山森林里，它那里到处鲜花长绿草，它那里果实累累挂满树，它那里百鸟和鸣叫唧嘹，有百鸟全尊凤凰为首领，肃清了满山的毒蛇和鸱枭，咱若去投它做报告，他一定号召百鸟替你把恨消。”老鹦哥喜鹊都说好好好，它三个把翅一展冲天高，飞到了西北山林地，见到了凤凰说根苗。凤凰听罢传命令，刹时间百鸟齐集动员了，山林下冬冬冬放了三声炮，领兵元帅大鹏雕，元帅登台一声喊，号召百鸟快快出窝巢。说着说着百鸟到，打正东一群鸟雀来到了，小碧玉便在头里走，后边飞的小麻鹩，画眉鸟生的毛色俊，云雀大长尾巴梢，鱼鹰飞过千里水，鹏鸟腾飞万丈高，小黄雀一边飞来一边叫，鸳鸯二鸟窈窕。东边的雀鸟刚把山林过，打正南一群雀鸟又到了：来了一群苇喳鸟，高声唱的吱＠①＠，来了一群麻子溜，一个个长着鼓眼泡，来了一群＠鹑鸟，喀＠喀＠叫的声音实在高，来了一群白鸥鸟，打一个剪翅好似水上漂，大雁列队飞行快，紧跟雷椎来到了。不说众鸟来把山林进，打正北一群雀鸟也到了：播谷鸟跳着锄头舞，红靛客唱一个加紧生产好歌谣。头前棒笙花和尚，朱鸡喜的吹云箫，小麻雀打着乓乒钗，百灵鸟唱歌真灵巧，啄木鸟就把秧歌扭，露鹚的锣鼓敲的好热闹，后跟一群歌手鹦鹉鸟，羽毛闪闪放光毫。不说众鸟来奏乐，打正西一君雀鸟又到了：头前吹号蓝蚂＠④，孔雀慌忙把旗摇，班鸠行走不怠慢，老鹳鸟又把战鼓敲，燕子老鸹运子弹，小鹁鸽带信来慰劳，水鸭鸭担来清泉水，赤背＠③咕咕叫的声音高，火葫芦背着一把剑，麦喳喳扛枪过眉梢，鹞鹰展翅去探路，兔虎鹰有力把给养挑，白雀燕雀来站队，年青的鹳鹩站末梢，老鹰做了大队长，喜鹊在旁喊口号。到这时百鸟齐宣誓，誓灭毒蛇和鸱枭，大队排开三千里，军号响来战鼓冬冬敲，百鸟的翅羽遮天地，一个个勇猛向前称英豪。一气冲到深山口，把深山围了一遭又一遭，马上捉住了老毒蛇，又去捉住老鸱枭，小鸱枭小毒蛇个个来投降，自然是宽大政策把它们饶，百鸟聚会庆祝大胜利，都欢呼凤凰万岁政策好来智谋高！说罢了百鸟朝凤一段事，劝诸位多学多想要记牢！
