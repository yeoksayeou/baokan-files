　　Implementing the Central People's Government's Directive on Protecting Factories
　　Publicly Owned Factories and Mines in Beijing, Tianjin, and Other Places
　　Launch Mass Inspections
　　Accidents in Various Factories and Mines Gradually Decrease
　　[By Our Newspaper] In order to thoroughly eliminate all kinds of phenomena that currently endanger production in factories and mines, and to establish a regular production order, in order to implement the Central People's Government's directive on protecting factories, preventing sabotage, and ensuring that no more acts of sabotage occur in the future, publicly owned factories and mines in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places, successively launched emergency mass inspection campaigns in November.

　　Establishing Inspection Committees to Conduct Organized and Planned Inspections
　　At the start of the campaign, each factory and mine first established inspection committees with the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League as the core, and deeply mobilized the masses to carry out organized and planned inspection work. After the establishment of the General Inspection Committee of the North China Machine Company in Tianjin and the inspection committees of its subordinate factories, leading cadres first conducted self-criticism, thereby stimulating the enthusiasm of all employees for inspection work. The inspection committee of the Shijingshan Foundry first formulated a "Draft Inspection Plan" before the inspection, convened a mass mobilization meeting, mobilized the masses by production unit to organize inspection teams, and launched a comprehensive and in-depth inspection campaign.

　　After preliminary inspections, various factories and mines have already discovered many problems. For example, the Yangquan Iron Plant in Shanxi first started by inspecting core equipment, and from November 23rd to 28th, completed the inspection of the water system, fan, and boiler sections. During the inspection, it was discovered that the electric pump and water meter were malfunctioning, the motor had not been cleaned for a long time, was heavily covered in grease, the vent was blocked, the ammeter was malfunctioning, the transformer was overloaded and frequently overheated, and the wiring was disorganized. Various steam pumps in the factory also had many problems. The Qixin Magnetic Factory in Tangshan, after half a month of inspection starting from November 16th, found a total of ninety-four items in need of repair and improvement in machinery, electrical equipment, construction, fire prevention, and other aspects. After inspection, the North China Chemical Company and its five subordinate factories also discovered many problems. For example, the nickel-steel pipes inside the evaporation tank of the Dagu Factory were corroded by alkali due to prolonged use, and the joints were cracked by one to two meters; the Weixin Chemical Factory stored twelve tons of flammable picric acid in an ordinary house, which was prone to fire.

　　In terms of discipline and systems, some workers at the Hangu No. 1 Factory did not observe working hours when going to work. When leaving work, continuous work was also abandoned due to eagerness to leave work, without waiting for the handover to be completed. At the Rubber Parts Factory of the North China Machine Company, 1,150 kilograms of red clay were damaged due to the negligence of the employees responsible for storing materials; the casting department of the Machine Factory wasted more than 3,000 work hours due to inappropriate ingredients when making calender rolls. After more than 20 days of in-depth inspection, the company received around 1,000 reports and opinions from various units.

　　Weak Awareness of Cherishing National Property
　　The reasons for the above phenomena are primarily the leadership's weak awareness of protecting state property, bureaucratic work style, and carelessness in work. For example, the Bicycle Factory of the North China Machine Company did not discuss the sale of scrap iron at the management committee meeting, nor did it explain it to the employees. As a result, when the materials were being moved out of the factory, it was discovered that there were still many good pieces of iron in the scrap, causing undue losses to the factory. The main shaft driven by the 75HP motor of the Qixin Magnetic Factory in Tangshan had been used for too long and was too worn. Although the leadership had inspected it once, it was not thorough, causing the shaft to break on November 29th. Fortunately, the worker watching the motor discovered it early and turned off the power in time, preventing a tragedy. However, the fracture of the shaft caused fourteen piezoelectric magnetic machines, two water pumps, nine ball mills, and machines in the rolling and spinning departments to stop production; the daily output of low-voltage double semi-finished magnetic products was reduced by more than 1,700, and the daily output of magnetic mud was reduced by 5,500 kilograms, resulting in significant production losses.

　　Secondly, old and dilapidated machines and incomplete parts, which can often cause danger, are not inspected in a timely manner or properly handled. Various machines at the Qixin Magnetic Factory have been used for more than 30 years, and most of the shaft tiles have been worn out. Many parts need to be replaced. The water drain pipe of the boiler fan at the Yangquan Iron Plant has rotted for thirty meters, the valve is leaking, the iron pull rod of the water pump has rusted, and the beam, which is more than five meters long, is carrying too much load and is in danger of collapsing. If these dangerous situations are not corrected quickly, danger can occur at any time. The Tianjin Steel Plant discovered a water leak in the tap water pipe two months ago, but it was not repaired in time, resulting in a leak of 100,000 gallons of water. The driving capacity of the 30-hour wire drawing machine in the No. 2 Branch cannot meet the burden of fast driving. Workers suggested switching to slow driving, but the person in charge did not adopt the suggestion, resulting in damage to the machine.

　　Slack Systems and Relaxed Discipline
　　Thirdly, slack systems, relaxed discipline, and serious guerrilla habits have hindered the establishment of a regular production order. For example, some workers at the Yangquan Iron Plant sleep, play chess, drink, and wander around during work, and do private work at will. Hygiene in the factory is not emphasized, and tools and excrement are piled up together. Although the Northwest Chemical Plant has warehouse regulations, they are not enforced. The warehouse does not have a fixed person in charge, and the personnel receiving and issuing materials in the same warehouse are not fixed. According to inspections, the actual number of files, gauze, wind steel, and other materials stored in the warehouse does not match the records. Some shares of unused items are also randomly placed in the warehouse; there are too many loan materials with no regulations and have not been cleaned up for a long time; some materials that should be wrapped are not wrapped, and some that should be oiled are not oiled, and various materials are mixed together; some windows are accessible, and the roof is leaking but not repaired. The steel materials in the Tianjin Machine Factory warehouse were also rusted due to leaks. According to statistics from the Automobile Parts Factory in October, 69 employees were late for work.

　　After the inspection, in order to ensure that no accidents occur in the future and to establish a regular production order, many factories and mines have initially implemented the following necessary measures:

　　Ideologically Improve and Establish a Serious and Responsible Concept
　　1. First of all, improve the ideology of employees and establish a serious and responsible concept of protecting state property. In order to improve the sense of responsibility of cadres and employees for their work and to ensure the safety of machinery and property from an organizational perspective, the Yangquan Industrial and Mining District Committee of the Communist Party of China has launched a mass public appraisal of cadres from the bottom up in various factories and mines. The content of the appraisal includes the sense of responsibility for protecting state property, loyalty, work style, labor discipline, and work ability. Other factories and mines have also convened meetings of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres to repeatedly discuss risk prevention and security work, expose and criticize various erroneous ideas, and begin to establish the concept of cherishing state property and workers' lives. The deep ideological inspection of all cadres and employees of the Tianjin Supply Bureau's Motor Transport Team has greatly educated everyone. Cheng Shubin, a driver of the team, made a plan on the spot after review to save gasoline in the next three months to compensate for the country's losses.

　　Strict System to Protect Machines
　　2. Stipulate strict systems to ensure the rational use and safety of machinery; strictly enforce labor discipline and establish a regular production order. In order to prevent the factory from being damaged in the future and to establish a clean and good production order, the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant has, after the initial completion of the inspection work, specifically formulated future production equipment inspection systems and methods in each production unit. The factory leadership has also formulated a comprehensive "Factory Safety Inspection Rules" and "Inspection Methods for Important Parts of Production" based on the inspection systems of each unit. The inspection rules stipulate: machine cleaning work shall be carried out once a week according to a fixed schedule. Establish a strict handover system. Special circumstances must be notified to the successor. The 15th Ordnance Factory has formulated various special rules, such as "Boiler Rules," "Electrical Rules," "Drying Rules," "Machine Rules," "Water Pump Rules," "Fire Protection Rules," "Storage Rules," and "Security Rules." Each production unit of the Yangquan Power Plant has also established a protection group, formulated "Working Regulations of the Protection Committee," "Machine Safety Standards," "Security Award and Punishment System Draft," and "Specific Division of Labor System for Each Unit." The entire plant also carried out a clean-up and sanitation campaign.

　　After the inspection, many factories and mines have achieved preliminary improvements. Under the spirit of "relying on the masses to solve problems themselves," the Shijingshan Foundry has corrected many dangerous situations. For example, the third pipe factory previously piled up tens of thousands of bundles of grass ropes, which were very close to the pipe machine. If a spark of molten iron fell on it, it would cause a fire. With the efforts of the workers, it was all moved away in less than a day. The 2,200-volt high-voltage line of the Qixin Magnetic Factory did not have insurance before, but it has now been installed; the 25-horsepower electric roller did not have anything to cover it and was often coated with dirty soil, which was easily damaged, but a door has now been installed; the electrical wires of the entire plant have been in disrepair for many years and are prone to danger, and it has been decided to completely repair them in December. After the Yangquan Iron Plant found that there were problems with the machines, each unit immediately carried out repairs. The fan unit has repaired four problems with the water pump, and other units have also replaced the tie rods with steel ones to prevent rust. After the Yangquan No. 4 Coal Mine stipulated the handover system, it has been implemented very well. Whether there is fire in the coal mine, the condition of the coal planer, and whether the ventilation is good or not must be explained clearly when leaving work. Some parts of the mine have adopted safety lamps, and in the large passageway under the pit, each section has three special fire testers who have also implemented a handover system. Unstable places in the passageway are promptly supported with shed pillars, and attention is paid to the regular rectification of the ventilation ducts. Thanks to the system, the sense of responsibility of the cadres has been greatly strengthened, and no fire hazards have occurred in October and November. After the Tianjin North China Machine Company's Rubber Parts Factory accepted the reasonable suggestions of the workers after the inspection, the output of automobile tires has doubled; the Automobile Parts Factory strictly implemented the eight-hour work system, and the daily output of pistons has increased by two and a half times compared with before the inspection.

　　贯彻中央人民政府保护工厂指示
  　京津等地公营厂矿           
    展开群众性大检查
  　各厂矿发生事故已逐渐减少
    【本报讯】为彻底消除工厂矿山中目前存在的危及生产的各种现象，并建立正规的生产秩序，以贯彻中央人民政府关于保护工厂，防止破坏，保证今后不再有破坏事件发生的指示，北京、天津、山西、河北等地各公营工厂、矿山，于十一月间，先后展开了紧急大检查运动。
    　　　　成立检查委员会进行有领导有计划的检查
    运动开始，各工厂、矿山均首先以党、政、工、团为核心，组织了检查委员会，并深入发动群众，进行有领导有计划的检查工作。天津市华北机器公司总检查委员会及所属各厂检查委员会成立之后，各领导干部首先作了自我检查，从而启发了全体职工检查工作的积极性。石景山铸造厂检查委员会，在检查前先制定了“检查计划草案”，召开了群众动员大会，按生产单位发动群众组织了检查小组，展开普遍深入的检查运动。
    各工矿经过初步检查，已经发现不少问题，如山西阳泉铁厂首先从检查核心设备入手，从十一月二十三日到二十八日，已将水道系统、风机、锅炉部分检查完毕。在检查中发现了电泵、水表失效，电动机久未擦洗，油腻大厚，风眼堵塞，电流表失效，变压器超过负荷，经常发热，线路紊乱。厂内各种汽泵也存在着许多毛病。唐山启新磁厂，从十一月十六日起，经过半个月的检查之后，发现在机器、电气、建筑、消防等各方面，需要修理和改善的共达九十四项。华北化学公司及所属五个厂，经过检查后也发现了许多问题，如大沽工厂的蒸发罐内的镍钢管子，因使用日久被碱侵蚀，接口处裂开一至二米；维新化学厂把易于燃烧的十二吨苦黄，存放在一间普通的房子里，容易发火。
    在纪律与制度方面，汉沽一厂有些工人上班时不遵守时间，下班时，有连续性的工作也因急于下班，不等接管完毕即离开工作岗位。华北机器公司橡胶配件厂，因保存物料的职工疏忽职守，损坏红土一千一百五十公斤；机器厂铸造部做压光机滚轴，由于加料的成份不恰当，浪费了三千余工时。该公司经过二十多天的深入检查，各单位检举的事实和提供的意见均在一千条左右。
    　　　　爱护国家资财观念不强
    造成上述现象的原因，首先是由于领导上保护国家财产的观念不强，官僚主义作风和工作上的粗枝大叶。如华北机器公司自行车工厂，在出卖废铁时，就没有在管委会上讨论，也没有向职工说明，结果在搬料出厂时，才发现废料中还有很多好铁块，使工厂受到不应有的损失。唐山启新磁厂七五ＨＰ电动机所带动的总轴，因使用过久，磨损太多，领导上虽经一度检查但不细致，致使该轴于十一月二十九日折断，幸亏看电动机的工人发觉较早，及时关闭电门，未造成惨祸。可是由于该轴的折断，使该厂十四个压电磁机，两个水泵，九个球磨及轧活部、旋活部等机器均停止生产；低压双重式电磁半成品每天减产一千七百余个，制磁的泥料每天减产五千五百公斤。生产遭受重大损失。
    其次是机器残老，机件不全，经常可能引起危险，而又不注意及时检查，妥善处理。启新磁厂各项机器都已使用了三十余年，大部轴瓦均已磨蚀，不少机件都需要拆换。阳泉铁厂锅炉风机的放水管，已烂了三十米达，气门跑气，水泵的铁拉杆生了诱，五丈多长的大梁负力太重，有塌下的危险。这些危险情况如不赶快纠正，则随时可以产生危险。天津制钢厂，在两月以前就发现了自来水管漏水，但没有及时修理，结果漏水十万加仑。二分厂三十时拉丝机的带动能力不能胜任开快车的负担，工人曾提议改开慢车，但主管人没有采纳，结果把机器坏了。
    　　　　制度松懈纪律废弛
    再次是制度松懈、纪律废弛，和严重的游击习气，阻碍了正规生产秩序的建立。如阳泉铁厂有的工人在工作中睡觉、下棋、喝酒、乱窜，随便外出做私人活等，厂内卫生不讲究，屎尿工具乱堆在一起。西北化学厂的库房，虽有库房守则但不执行，库房没有确定专责制，同一库房收发材料人员不固定。据检查该库房所存锉刀、沙布、风钢等数种材料，实数均和帐上不符。有些股不用的东西亦在库房乱放；借料情形太多，无一规定，且久未清理；有些材料应包者未包，应上油者未上油，各种材料混堆一起；有的窗子可以进入，屋顶漏雨也不修理。天津机器厂仓库因为漏雨，把钢铁材料也锈坏了。汽车配件厂据十月份统计，迟上班职工达六十九人。
    经检查之后，为了保证今后不再发生事故，并建立正规的生产秩序，不少工厂、矿山已初步实行了下列必要措施：
    从思想上提高一步树立认真负责观念
    一、首先在职工中，从思想上提高一步，树立认真负责的保护国家资财的观念。中共阳泉工矿区委员会，为提高干部、职工对工作的责任心，从组织上保证机器财产的安全，已发动各厂、矿对干部进行自下而上群众性的公开鉴定，鉴定内容包括对国家财产爱护的责任心，忠诚态度，工作作风，劳动纪律，工作能力等。其他各厂矿也都召开了党、政、工、团干部会议，反复讨论了防险保安工作，揭发批判了各种错误思想，开始树立了爱护国家财产和工人生命的观念。天津供应局汽车运输队，全体干部职工经过深入的思想检查后，对大家的教育极大。该队司机程树彬，经检讨当场提出节约立功计划，保证今后三个月内节省出过去所偷汽油，以弥补国家的损失。
    　　　　严密制度保护机器
    二、规定严密的制度，保证机器的合理使用与安全；严格执行劳动纪律，建立正规生产秩序。石家庄炼焦厂为使今后工厂免于破坏，并树立整洁良好的生产秩序，在检查工作初步结束后，各生产单位都具体制定今后的生产设备检查制度与办法，该厂领导上又根据各单位的检查制度制出全面的“工厂安全检查规则”与“生产重要部分的检查办法”。检查规则中规定：每周进行一次机件清扫洗刷工作，均按固定时间操作。建立严格的交接制度，下班时有特殊情形必须告知接班者注意。兵工十五厂，制定了各种专门守则，如“锅炉守则”、“电汽守则”、“烘干守则”、“机器守则”、“水泵守则”、“消防守则”、“保管守则”、“警卫守则”等。阳泉发电厂各生产单位并成立了防护小组，制定“防护委员会工作条例”，和“机器安全标准”及“保安奖惩制度草案”、“各股具体分工制度”等。全厂并进行了清洁卫生运动。
    经过检查之后，不少工厂、矿山已获初步改进。石景山铸造厂，在“依靠群众，自己解决问题”的精神下，已纠正很多危险事态，如该厂第三管厂，从前堆了上万捆的草绳子，距管机很近，万一管机的铁水星一落上去，就得引起火灾，在工人们努力下，不到一天时间就搬运一空。启新磁厂二千二高压线，以前没有保险，现已添装；二五马力电滚子没有东西遮盖，时常涂脏土，易受损坏，现已安上门子；全厂电线年久失修易生危险，已决定在十二月份全部整修完竣。阳泉铁厂查出机器有毛病后，各股立即进行修理，风机股已将水泵四处毛病修好，其他各股也将拉杆换成钢的，以防水锈。阳泉第四煤矿规定出交班制度后已执行的很好，对煤洞有火没有，炭刨的如何，通风好不好等，在下班时都要交待明白。该矿部分地方已采用安全灯，坑下大行道，每段都设了专门试火员三个，他们也实行了交班制，行道中不坚固的地方都及时打棚顶柱，风道也注意了经常整顿。由于该矿有了制度，干部责任心大大加强了，十、十一两月均无火险发生。天津华北机器公司橡胶配件厂，由于检查以后接受了工人的合理建议，汽车外胎产量增加了一倍；汽车配件厂严格执行了八小时工作制，活塞日产量较检查前增加了两倍半。
