　　Phragmites Communis
　　——A Valuable Discovery for the Papermaking Industry
　　Zheng Jia
　　Tianjin is the center of the papermaking industry in North China. Besides a few relatively large paper mills in Beijing, Tangshan, and Xuanhua, Tianjin concentrates most of the paper mills. There is a state-owned pulp and paper company, including two factories; in addition, there are twenty private paper mills. If the raw materials are sufficient and all the machines are started, 200 tons of paper can be produced per month.

　　Before liberation, during the period of Japanese occupation, due to the Japanese high degree of control over raw materials and a large number of Japanese paper monopolizing the market, the Tianjin papermaking industry, like all other national industries, was in a state of lingering on, barely maintaining itself. During the Kuomintang rule, a large number of dumped American paper arrived, coupled with the bankruptcy of the Chiang currency and financial chaos, most of the paper mills fell into a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown.

　　After the liberation of Tianjin, thanks to the increase in the enthusiasm of the workers and the step-by-step assistance of the People's Government, the paper mills successively resumed production. In the past ten months, the papermaking industry accounted for one-sixth of all the loans from the Bank of Communications to various industries; in July, the import of all foreign paper was prohibited, thus increasing the sales of paper, especially the upcoming climax of cultural construction, which brought greater rewards and hopes to the papermaking industry. For example, the recent National Publishing Industry Conference requested Tianjin alone to supply 800 tons of printing paper per month.

　　However, there are still many difficulties in the development of the papermaking industry. The raw material problem of papermaking is one of many difficult problems. In the past, the manufacture of printing paper mostly relied on foreign raw materials. This raw material problem left by the colonial industry's dependence on imperialism is a great obstacle to the development of the papermaking industry. As the saying goes, "Even the cleverest housewife cannot cook a meal without rice." Without raw materials, or with insufficient raw materials, the papermaking industry cannot be maintained for a long time, let alone develop. On the premise of not relying on foreign raw materials, the raw material problem for packaging paper, straw paper, newsprint, writing paper, and grey paper is relatively easy to solve, and reeds, rice straw, hemp, mulberry bark, wheat straw, etc. can be used as raw materials; and the most difficult is the raw material problem of printing paper, which is needed in large quantities. Using waste cotton, waste paper, and rags, how much can there be of these things? Especially the electricity cost of waste cotton and rags is too high, and in terms of equipment, if there is no blower, the dust of waste cotton and rags cannot be removed, and the paper made is greyish yellow with many black spots, and the quality is not good. The result will inevitably fall into a predicament of production shrinking, low profits, and sluggish sales. The reeds produced in Hebei Province are a relatively good raw material. Now the Tianjin State-owned Pulp and Paper Company uses a part of reeds to make printing paper, but reeds must be manufactured by the acid method, which requires certain equipment and technology, and the output of reeds cannot meet the raw material requirements of the required printing paper. Although wood pulp imported from the United States, Canada, and Australia can be replaced by wood pulp manufactured from timber from Northeast China and Taiwan, the output is too small to solve the problem.

　　After hearing such problems, the imperialists will surely shout with joy: "You Chinese people still can't do this or that!" However, the Chinese people who have stood up are not afraid of difficulties. With such rich resources in our motherland, can't we find a kind of raw material for papermaking? Under this belief, the Tianjin papermaking industry began the struggle to find and research papermaking raw materials.

　　An exhibit called Phragmites Communis displayed in the Industrial Improvement Hall of the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition is the most valuable harvest of this struggle. Various high-quality paper are placed next to the Phragmites Communis, which are made from Phragmites Communis as raw materials. The discovery of Phragmites Communis is a great contribution to the papermaking industry, and it has opened up an extremely rich resource.

　　Wang Yunshan, the manager of the Tianjin Private Changjiang Paper Mill, was forced to stop work two years ago due to a lack of raw materials. At that time, he heard that there was a kind of grass on the northwestern prairie that was hard in quality and might be used for papermaking. He sent people to the northwest to seek it, and as a result, Phragmites Communis was found in the Baotou area. Once tested, it proved to be a good papermaking raw material. The Changjiang Paper Mill once used Phragmites Communis to make a part of the paper, which was transported and sold to Shanghai and was very popular.

　　At first, this new discovery was kept as a secret. After liberation, Mr. Wang Yunshan recognized the People's Government's policy of developing industry and automatically reported this new discovery to the government and the papermaking industry.

　　The Central People's Government attaches great importance to this discovery and actively encourages the papermaking industry to continue research and investigation. In June of this year, a paper-making raw material investigation team jointly formed by public and private sectors was established.

　　According to the research results of the Tianjin State-owned Pulp and Paper Company, it is proved that whether using the acid method, alkali method, or magnesium bisulfite method, Phragmites Communis can be used to manufacture good paper. The tensile strength of the paper made by the alkali method is 8 grams, and the folding endurance of bleached paper is 1,640 times, and that of unbleached paper is 2,640 times. The folding endurance of American banknote paper is only more than 140 times. Papermaking with Phragmites Communis is simpler than using wood pulp. Its fiber is longer and more uniform than reeds, and tougher than rags and waste cotton. Although it cannot be finally concluded that Phragmites Communis can completely replace wood pulp, it is no problem to mix a little wood pulp to make various excellent printing papers.

　　On September 1, the Tianjin Papermaking Industry Raw Material Investigation Team set off. Representatives from public and private factories participated in the investigation in the Chahar and Suidong areas. In mid-October, the investigation team returned to Tianjin and planned to continue the investigation in Suixi after a while.

　　Phragmites Communis is a perennial plant, like reeds, growing once a year, so it is also called perennial grass. It is said that this grass is everywhere on the northwestern prairie, all the way to Xinjiang. Soil containing sand and alkali is easy to grow. The Phragmites Communis in the Beizi Temple area of Inner Mongolia is the highest. You can't see people riding into the grass. Farmers in the Suidong area generally use Phragmites Communis to weave baskets, brooms, door curtains, and car sheds, or use them as firewood. When they are tender, they feed livestock. In winter, there is nothing else to feed cattle and sheep in Inner Mongolia, and Phragmites Communis is also covered by heavy snow and cannot be seen. Only the grass tassels are still exposed on the snow, and herdsmen use these grass tassels to feed cattle and sheep.

　　In short, this Phragmites Communis, which can be used as a good raw material for papermaking, is also very useful for the local people.

　　The Baotou Pulp Mill Preparatory Committee has recently been established. They plan to use the large amount of Phragmites Communis produced in western Suiyuan, the natural alkali of the Ik Zhao League, the high-quality coal from Shigou Gully 20 kilometers west of Baotou, and the power from the Dengkou Hydropower Plant on the Yellow River to establish a pulp mill in Baotou. It is estimated that the annual output of Phragmites Communis in Baotou, Shanba, and Wuyuan areas is about 1.5 million tons. The pulp produced in the first year is estimated to meet the needs of paper mills in Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao. In the second year, it can be supplied to various parts of South China, and the national papermaking raw material problem can be solved. At the same time, the Baotou Pulp Mill Preparatory Committee also has a more ambitious nine-year plan, which includes the problem of using Phragmites Communis to manufacture rayon, because the fiber of Phragmites Communis is much better than the hemp fiber or wood fiber used to make ordinary rayon, and the quality of rayon produced will be very good.

　　At the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, in the exhibition area displaying Phragmites Communis and various excellent papers made from Phragmites Communis, people have seen the bright future of the vast development of the papermaking industry in the new China, and have seen the moving prospect of the gradual industrialization of the barren northwest prairie; this bright future is by no means the result of some "gift" from imperialism, but the result of our Chinese people's self-reliance.

　　枳机草
    ——造纸工业上一个有价值的发现
    郑佳
    天津，是华北造纸业的中心。除了北京、唐山、宣化有几家稍具规模的纸厂以外，天津集中了大部的造纸厂。有国营的纸浆造纸公司，包括两个厂；另外还有二十家私营的纸厂。如果原料充足，开动了全部机器，每月可以产纸二百吨。
    在解放以前，当日寇统治的时期，由于日寇高度的控制原料，和大量日本纸张垄断市场，天津造纸业也和其它一切民族工业一样，完全处在一种苟延残喘的情况下，勉强维持，到国民党统治时期，又来了大量倾销的美国纸张，再加上蒋币破产，金融混乱，大部纸厂陷于停工或是半停工的状态。
    天津解放以后，由于工人积极性的提高，人民政府有步骤的扶助，各纸厂先后恢复生产。十个月以来，在交通银行对各业的贷款中，造纸业就占全部的六分之一；七月份，一切洋纸都禁止入口了，因此增加了纸张的销路，特别是文化建设高潮的行将到来，给造纸业带来了更大的奖励和希望。比如最近召开的全国出版业会议，就要求天津一地每月供应印刷纸张八百砘。
    可是，造纸业在发展过程中仍然是有许多困难的。造纸的原料问题，就是许多困难问题之一。在过去，制造印刷纸张大部分是依靠外来原料，这个由殖民地工业对于帝国主义的依赖性所留下的原料问题，对于造纸工业的发展是一个很大的障碍。俗话说：“巧媳妇做不出无米的饭来”，没有原料，或者原料不充分，造纸工业当然不能长期维持，更不要说发展了。在不依靠外来原料的前提下，包装纸、草版纸、毛边纸、粉连纸、灰手纸这一类粗糙的日用纸，原料问题还比较容易解决，可以用苇子、稻草、麻、桑皮、麦秸等作原料；而最困难的是大量需用的印刷纸的原料问题。利用废棉、废纸、破布吧，这类东西能有多少？特别是废棉、破布的电费成本既太高，而且在设备上，如果没有吹风机，废棉破布的灰尘不能去掉，作出纸来是灰黄色，黑点很多，质量也就不好。结果必然要陷于生产萎缩，利润低落和销路不畅的窘境。河北产的芦苇倒是一种比较好的原料，现在天津国营纸浆造纸公司就是利用一部分芦苇造印刷纸，可是芦苇必需用酸法制造，需要一定的设备和技术，而且芦苇的产量又不能满足所需印刷纸的原料的要求，从美国、加拿大、澳洲等地进口的木浆，虽然可以用东北、台湾木材制造的木浆来代替，可惜产量也是太少，不能解决问题。
    听到这样的问题以后，帝国主义者一定又会高兴地叫嚣了：“你们中国人民还能这也不行那也不行啊！”但是，站起来了的中国人民，是不怕困难的，资源丰富的我们的祖国，难道就找不出一种造纸的原料来，在这样的信念下面，天津造纸业就开始了寻找与研究造纸原料的奋斗。
    在天津工业展览会工业改进馆里所陈列着的一种名叫枳机草的展览品，就是这种奋斗的最有价值的收获，枳机草旁边摆列着各种质量很好的纸，就是以枳机草作原料，制造出来的。枳机草的发现，对造纸业是一个伟大的贡献，它开拓了一个极其丰富的资源。
    天津私营长江造纸厂的经理王蕴山，在两年前因为原料缺乏，被迫停工。当时听说西北草原上有一种草，质量坚硬，也许可以造纸，他就派人到西北去寻求，结果在包头一带发现了枳机草，一经试验，证明是一种很好的造纸原料。长江造纸厂曾经用枳机草制出一部分纸张，运销上海，很受欢迎。
    一开始，这个新发现是被当作一个秘密保守着。解放以后，王蕴山先生认识了人民政府发展工业的政策，便自动的向政府和造纸工业界报告了这个新发现。
    中央人民政府非常重视这一发现，积极鼓励造纸工业界继续进行研究和考察的工作。今年六月成立了公私营造纸业合组的造纸原料考察团。
    据国营天津纸浆造纸公司研究的结果，证明无论用酸性、碱法或亚硫酸镁法，枳机草都可以制造出很好的纸来，用碱法试造的纸张，抗张度是八克，抗揉度漂白纸是一千六百四十次，未漂白纸是二千六百四十次。美国钞票纸的抗揉度也不过一百四十多次，用枳机草造纸比用木浆要简捷，它的纤维比芦苇长而且均匀，比破布废棉要坚韧。目前虽然还不能最后断定枳机草可以完全代替木浆，但是掺进少许木浆可以制成各种最优良的印刷纸是毫无问题的了。
    九月一号，天津造纸业原料考察团出发了，公私营各厂都派了代表参加，到察哈尔和绥东地区进行考察，十月中旬考察团回到天津，打算再过一个时候还继续到绥西去考察。
    枳机草是一种宿根植物，象芦苇一样，每年生长一次，所以又叫万年草。据说这种草在大西北草原上遍地都是，一直通到新疆。含砂含碱的土质容易生长。内蒙古贝子庙一带的枳机草最高，骑马钻进草里可以看不见人。绥东一带的农民普遍用枳机草来编制筐子、篮子、扫帚、门帘、车棚，或者是当柴烧，嫩的时候就喂牲口。冬天，内蒙一带没有别的东西喂牛羊，枳机草也被大雪盖得看不见了，只有草缨还露在雪上面，牧民们就用这草缨来喂牛羊。
    总之，这种可以作为很好的造纸原料的枳机草，对于当地人民的用处也是很多的。
    包头纸浆厂筹备委员会最近已经成立了。他们计划利用绥远西部出产的大量的枳机草，伊克昭盟的天然碱，包头以西二十公里石拐沟质量优良的煤，和黄河镫口的水力发电厂的动力，在包头设立一个纸浆厂。据估计包头、陕坝、五原一带每年所产枳机草大约有一百五十万吨，第一年所产纸浆估计可以供应北京、天津、济南、青岛各地纸厂的需要，第二年就可以供给华南各地，全国造纸原料问题可以获得解决。同时，包头纸浆厂筹备委员会还有一个更远大的九年计划，这个计划，包括了利用枳机草制造人造丝的问题，因为枳机草的纤维，比普通造人造丝的麻纤维或木纤维，都好得多，制出人造丝来，质量会很好。
    人们在天津工展会上，在陈列着枳机草和用枳机草制出来的各种优良纸张的一席之地上，已经看到了新中国造纸业广大发展的灿烂前途，看到荒漠的西北草原逐步走向工业的动人的远景；这光明的未来，绝不是靠帝国主义的什么“恩赐”，而将是我们中国人民自力更生的结果。
