Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th:

　　Lebanese representative Victoria El-Helou spoke at the Asian Women's Representative Conference on the 13th. The following is a summary:

　　Lebanon is a place where the contradictions between British and American imperialism are most obvious, because the oil pipeline passes through Lebanon. Therefore, imperialism relies on some large corporations as intermediaries, attempting to further infiltrate our country. Recently, the American fleet was stationed off the coast of Lebanon, making so-called "friendly visits." British imperialism, through its agents in Lebanon, distributed weapons to the traitor Anton Saadeh.

　　Until now, the Lebanese government has either been devoted to British imperialism or to American and French imperialism. The people in the country have no freedom of speech, assembly, association, or publication. The reactionary government restricts all people's organizations, and also tries every means to restrict the activities of the Lebanese women's own organization - the Lebanese Women's Rights League. Before I left Lebanon, four members of the Women's Rights League were arrested and imprisoned.

　　Despite this, the members of the Lebanese Women's Rights League are increasing day by day. This time, in order to converge the voices of Lebanese women with the voices of all Asian women under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Women's Rights League joyfully accepted the invitation of the Women's International Democratic Federation to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Here I assure you that Lebanese women are linked with the peace forces all over the world under the leadership of the Soviet Union.

　　Lebanese women resolutely oppose turning Lebanon into a base for British and American imperialism to attack the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union saved the world from the heinous crimes of the Nazis, because the Soviet Union is a friend of all people who yearn for freedom, democracy, and peace, because the Soviet Union is the lighthouse for all these people.

　　No force in the world can stop the people's struggle and progress.

　　I salute the dear sisters of the Soviet Union!

　　I salute the women of China!

　　I salute all the sisters in the extremely oppressed countries of Asia who are fighting for independence, freedom, and democracy!

　　黎巴嫩代表维多利亚·爱尔·海露发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】黎巴嫩代表维多利亚·爱尔·海露十三日在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言，摘要如下：
    黎巴嫩是一个英美帝国主义之间矛盾最明显的地方，因为油管正好通过黎巴嫩，所以帝国主义便靠一些大企业公司为媒介，企图更深入地侵入我们的国家。新近美国舰队停泊在黎巴嫩海岸，正做着所谓“友谊访问”。英帝国主义则借他们在黎巴嫩的代理人之手分发武器给卖国贼昂东·萨哈德。
    直到现在，黎巴嫩政府不是投效于英帝国主义，就是投效于美法帝国主义。国内人民没有言论、集会、结社、出版的自由。反动政府限制一切人民团体的活动，同时也想尽一切办法限制黎巴嫩妇女自己的组织——黎巴嫩妇权同盟的活动。在我离开黎巴嫩之前，有四位妇权同盟的委员被捕入狱。
    虽然如此，但黎巴嫩妇权同盟的盟员却日渐增多。这次妇权同盟为了使黎巴嫩妇女的呼声与全亚洲妇女的呼声在国际民主妇联领导下汇合起来，便欢欣鼓舞地接受了国际民主妇联的邀请出席亚洲妇女代表会议。这里我向你们保证，黎巴嫩妇女是和全世界在苏联领导下的和平力量联结在一起的。
    黎巴嫩妇女坚决反对将黎巴嫩作为英美帝国主义进攻苏联的基地，因为苏联把世界从纳粹的穷凶极恶中拯救了出来，因为苏联是所有渴望自由、民主、和平人民的朋友，因为苏联是所有这些人民的灯塔。
    世界上没有任何力量可以阻止人民的战斗和前进。
    我向苏联的亲爱的姐妹们致敬！
    我向中国的妇女们致敬！
    我向亚洲非常被压迫国家内一切争独立自由民主的姐妹们致敬！
