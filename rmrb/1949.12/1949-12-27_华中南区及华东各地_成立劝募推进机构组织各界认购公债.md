People from all walks of life in Wuhan and various parts of Central China are also actively preparing to welcome the government's issuance of public bonds. The preparatory committee of the Wuhan and Central China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a notice on saving production and supporting the government's issuance of victory inflation-adjusted public bonds, calling on workers to resolutely complete the task, and instructing trade unions at all levels to immediately launch publicity and discussions among the working masses. The notice stipulates the following specific measures: 1.

Advocate thrift and reduce unnecessary waste during the New Year and Spring Festival to purchase public bonds. 3. Conscientiously summarize the achievements of production savings in the past six months and prepare to formulate new production savings plans to welcome the great production movement.
