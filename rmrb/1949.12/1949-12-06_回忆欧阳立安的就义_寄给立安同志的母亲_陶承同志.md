Remembering Ouyang Li'an's Martyrdom
	   Sent to Comrade Li'an's Mother, Comrade Tao Cheng

Comrade Tao Cheng:

Reading the article "Remembering My Son's Sacrifice" in the People's Daily filled me with both sorrow and joy!

I am saddened because the heroic and impassioned scene of Comrade Li'an and others sacrificing themselves in those years, and the patches of bright red blood on the snowy ground of Longhua in Shanghai, are still vividly etched in my mind. I will never forget Comrade Li'an's spirit!

I am joyful to learn that he has a respectable revolutionary mother still alive, and to know that he had an outstanding revolutionary heritage as a descendant of Ouyang Meisheng, an early Chinese Bolshevik.

I must tell you that I was one of those arrested in the same case as Comrade Li'an. He went to the Soviet Union in the winter of 1929 to attend the International Conference of Workers and Youth. At that time, I had recently returned from studying in the Soviet Union and was serving as the secretary of the Zhabei District Committee of the Party in Shanghai. Comrade Li'an was a cadre selected from the Zhabei District, and I personally spoke with him three times. I remember that during the second conversation, Comrade Yun Daiying, secretary of the Huzhong District Committee, and Comrade He Mengxiong, secretary of the Hudong District Committee, also participated. Finally, I saw him off on the Soviet ship bound for Vladivostok. However, comrades only knew that his surname was Yang, and did not know that his full surname was Ouyang.

Shortly after Comrade Li'an returned to China, he was arrested at the Oriental Hotel in Shanghai on the night of January 17, 1931. At that time, he was a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Minister of the Youth Workers' Department of the Shanghai General Labor Union. He went to the Oriental Hotel to attend the preparatory committee meeting for the First National Soviet Congress. After being arrested, he was detained in the Lao Zha Police Station and later extradited to the Kuomintang's Public Security Bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. On the night of February 7, at 10 o'clock, he was murdered by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the square within the Longhua headquarters! His remains were buried next to the pagoda in the square. There were as many as twenty-three male and female comrades who died heroically, such as Lin Yunan, Li Qiushi, He Mengxiong, Long Dadao, Yun Yutang, Cai Bozhen, Hu Yepin, Xu Yinfu, Rou Shi, Feng Keng (female), Wu Zhongwen (female), Li Wen (female), Wang Kun, and Fei Dafu, all of whom were the most outstanding fighters of the Chinese proletariat. The youngest was Comrade Li'an, who was only eighteen years old at the time. Thirteen others in the same case were sentenced to five to ten years in prison, mainly because the traitor who informed on them did not recognize them and could not identify them. In addition to myself, those who are still alive include Li Chuli, Ke Zhongping, Zhang Shaoqiu, Wang Minxian, Chen Fanggu, Ren Hongzhu, and Huang Shoumei. I was arrested for the second time at the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and was not released until half a year ago. Comrade He Mengxiong's entire family was arrested. After he was killed, his wife was sentenced to six years in prison, and his two children were sent to orphanages and nurseries, and their whereabouts are now unknown. The traitor who informed on them was named Tang Yu, who died of syphilis fifteen years ago.

After Comrade Li'an was arrested, he used the alias Yang Guohua. In the enemy's court, he displayed the most heroic, magnificent, alert, and resolute qualities of a Bolshevik! The enemy used all kinds of cruel torture, coercion, and sweet words to lure him, but despite his young age of eighteen, he refused to yield like the other comrades. After learning that a traitor had identified him, he said with great passion: "I have nothing else to say. The Chinese revolution will surely succeed! The Kuomintang reactionaries will surely perish! I am a Communist Party member. Even if my bones turn to ashes, I will still be a one hundred percent communist! I die for my ideals and for the people, and I have no regrets! However, after my death, I hope you will not announce my real name, because I have a mother, brothers, and sisters at home, and they will be sad if they know." These heroic and magnificent words moved even the reactionary judges and soldiers so much that they could not ask any more questions!

After being interrogated in court, he knew that he was doomed to die and never entertained any侥幸 thoughts. At that time, Comrade Huang Jingwen, the person in charge of the Five Mutual Aid Society, personally sent a batch of clothes, bedding, medicines, and money to me. We held a meeting to discuss how to distribute them. Comrade Li'an advocated distributing the clothes, bedding, and medicines to other fellow prisoners, and using the money to buy wine and food. He opposed some comrades' proposal to buy daily necessities such as towels, toothbrushes, soap, and toothpaste. He said, "Most of us are doomed to die. We could die today or tomorrow. What's the point of having clothes and toothbrushes! We might as well buy some wine and food and have a good time, so that we have the energy to sing the Internationale and shout slogans when we are executed!" As he expected, on the third day after the Mutual Aid Society sent the relief supplies, they were killed by the reactionaries! Comrade Hu Yepin's request at the time was to use the money to find a barber to get a haircut, saying, "Even if I am photographed by the reactionaries after my execution, I can still look majestic. Even if I become a ghost, I will not let the reactionaries off!"

On the night of February 7, 1931, at 10 o'clock, the numerous iron gates of the prison suddenly opened, and a large number of armed soldiers, holding kerosene lamps, poured in and called out the names of each martyr from a list, saying: "Immediately transferred to Nanjing." Each person was shackled with more than ten kilograms of leg irons and handcuffs, and a total of twenty-three people were taken out. Less than five minutes after they left the prison, a burst of gunfire was heard outside the prison, accompanied by the tragic and impassioned singing of the Internationale and the slogans "Down with the Kuomintang!" "Down with Chiang Kai-shek!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the victory of the Chinese Revolution!"

The next day, a prison guard told me that the twenty-three martyrs were shot to death by a row of soldiers with rifles. The last to fall was a female hero, Comrade Wu Zhongwen (secretary of the Zhabei District Committee of the Communist Youth League). She was shot thirteen times before she died. When she was shot the tenth time, she was still shouting "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" Another female comrade, Feng Keng (a student at Fudan University and a representative of the Shanghai Student Union attending the First Soviet Congress), was shot nine times before she died. The soldiers who carried out the execution were so moved that their hands went limp, and they deserted afterwards! The twenty-three most heroic comrades were brutally shot to death by the reactionaries in the snow. It was not until the afternoon of the next day that the leg irons and handcuffs were removed, their clothes were stripped off, and the twenty-three people were thrown into a pit that had been dug in advance (next to the Longhua Pagoda). The Kuomintang butchers ended this scene of brutally killing revolutionary martyrs in this way!

Such a cruel act of massacring revolutionary martyrs filled the more than 500 prisoners in the prison with hatred and grief!

Lin Yunan and Li Qiushi wrote a long report to the Party Central Committee in prison, which was handed over to the comrades who were in contact with the Mutual Aid Society to be forwarded. Hu Yepin wrote a novel in prison, which was unfinished when he was killed; his last words were: I want to give the manuscript to Comrade Ding Ling to keep as a memento. Before his sacrifice, Comrade He Mengxiong knew that he was bound to die. He believed that it was a revolutionary's duty to sacrifice his precious life for the revolution. What he was most worried about were his two beloved young children! But he did not waver because of this.

Comrade Wang Yifan, a representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, was also imprisoned for revolutionary struggle at that time. He witnessed the reactionary's cruel massacre of revolutionary martyrs. Two months ago, when I met him at the Beijing Hotel, he specifically mentioned Comrade Li'an, the youngest, smartest, most heroic, and most magnificent of my fellow prisoners. This shows that although Comrade Li'an was only eighteen years old, his revolutionary spirit deeply moved everyone who knew him!

The process of the Chinese revolution is a history of blood and tears. Without the blood of the martyrs, the revolution would not have succeeded! Comrade Li'an and others sacrificed themselves for the establishment of the revolutionary regime of the People's Republic of China! They dedicated their entire lives to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, and contributed their last drop of blood!

Nineteen years have passed. Countless revolutionary martyrs have struggled and advanced, treading on the blood of their predecessors! Today, they have finally overthrown the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, enabling the Chinese people to achieve true liberation and basic victory! The blood of the martyrs has not been shed in vain!

You are Comrade Li'an's mother, and I offer you my highest respect and sincere condolences! Please tell me your address, I want to visit you.

### 回忆欧阳立安的就义　寄给立安同志的母亲——陶承同志

　　回忆欧阳立安的就义
　  寄给立安同志的母亲——陶承同志
    陶承同志：
    在人民日报上读到“回忆儿子的牺牲”一文，真使我悲喜交集！
    悲的是想到当年立安同志等英勇牺牲时慷慨激昂的一幕，上海龙华雪地上斑斑殷红的血迹，至今仍是鲜明地记忆在我的脑海中。立安同志的精神我是永远也忘不了的！
    喜的是知道了他还有一个可敬的革命的母亲健在着；并且知道了他原来具有优越的革命传统，是中国早期的布尔塞维克欧阳梅生同志的后裔。
    我得告诉你，我是立安同志同案被捕者之一。他于一九二九年冬去苏联出席国际职工及青年大会时，我那时正由苏联学习回来不久，在上海担任党的闸北区委书记。立安同志是由闸北区选拔出来的干部，我曾与他亲自谈话三次。记得在第二次的谈话时，并有沪中区委书记恽代英同志、沪东区委书记何孟雄同志参加。最后我送他踏上去海参威的苏联轮船。不过同志间只知道他姓扬，而不知是复姓欧阳。
    立安同志回国后不久，就在一九三一年一月十七日的夜晚，于上海东方旅馆被捕了。他那时所担负的工作是共产主义青年团江苏省委委员兼上海总工会青工部部长，到东方饭店去是为了出席第一次全国苏维埃代表大会的筹备委员会会议，被捕后，拘禁于老闸巡捕房，后来引渡到国民党的公安总局而淞沪警备司令部，到了二月七日夜晚十时，被国民党反动派杀害于龙华的司令部之内的广场上！遗体也即理葬在广场内的方塔旁边。同志就义的男女同志共二十三人之多，如林育南、李求实、何孟雄、龙大道、恽雨棠、蔡博真、胡也频、徐殷夫、柔石、冯铿（女）、伍仲文（女）、李文（女）、王昆、费达夫等，皆是中国无产阶级最优秀的战士。而年龄最小的，就是立安同志，他那时只有十八岁。同案中尚有十三人是判了五年到十年的徒刑，主要原因是告密的叛徒不认识他们，无从指证。现在尚健在的除我外，尚有李初犁、柯仲平、张少秋、王民先、陈方谷、任红珠、黄瘦梅等人。我在抗战末期又第二次被捕，直到半年前始出狱。何孟雄同志是全家被捕的，他就义后，他的爱人被判了六年徒刑，两个孩子被送到孤儿院及育婴堂，现在都不知下落了。告密的叛徒叫唐禹，已于十五年前患梅毒而死去了。
    立安同志被捕后，化名杨国华，在敌人的法庭上，表现着最英勇、壮烈、机警、沉毅的布尔塞维克的品质！敌人的惨刑威逼与甘言引诱，无所不用其极，但他虽以十八岁的幼年，竟与其他同志一样的不为所屈，知道了有叛徒指证他的身份后，他乃慷慨激昂的说：“我没有别的可说的，中国革命一定会成功的！国民党反动派一定就要灭亡的！我是一个共产党员，虽筋骨变成了灰，仍是百分之百的共产主义者！我为主义、为人民而死，死而无怨！不过我死后，望你们不要将我的真姓名宣布，因为我有母亲弟妹在家，给他们知道了要难过的。”这一段英勇壮烈的话，连反动派的法官及士兵无不感动得话都再也问不下去了！
    问过一庭之后，他知死多少生，绝不作万一侥幸之想。当时五济会的负责人黄静汶同志亲自送了一批衣被药品及金钱给我，我们开会商议如何来支配。立安同志主张将衣被药品分给在狱的其他难友，金钱即拿来买酒菜吃，他反对有些同志主张要买毛巾、牙刷、肥皂、牙粉等日用品，他说：“我们中间多数是死定了的。今天死，明天死皆有可能，要衣服牙刷等物来干什么啊！还不如买些酒菜来吃个痛快，以便临刑时唱国际歌喊口号时有精神些！”果然不出他所料，在互济会送接济来的第三天，他们就给反动派杀害了！胡也频同志当时的要求是拿钱去找一理发匠来理一次发，他说：“就义后给反动派拍起照来亦可威武一点。我就是做了鬼，对反动派也不会放松的！”
    一九三一年二月七日的夜晚十时，忽然看守所的数重铁门打开了，大批的武装士兵手提马灯蜂涌而入，拿了一张名单唤着每个烈士的姓名，说是：“即刻移解南京。”每人钉上了十多斤重的脚镣与手铐，一共提出去二十三人。当他们离开看守所不到五分钟，就听到在看守所外面一阵的乱枪声，夹着是悲壮激昂的国际歌声及“打倒国民党！”“打倒蒋介石！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中国革命胜利万岁！”的口号声。
    到了第二天由看守所的看守兵告诉我，知道二十三位烈士是给一排兵用步枪打死的。最后一个倒下的是一位女英雄伍仲文（团的闸北区书）同志，她一共打了十三枪才死，当打了第十枪时，她还在高呼中国共产党万岁！另一女同志冯铿（复旦大学学生，是当时上海学联会出席苏维埃第一次代表大会的代表），被打了九枪才死。执行的士兵感动得手都软了，事后就开小差不干了！二十三位最英勇的同志，就这样被反动派活活的用乱枪打死在雪地上。直到第二天下午才将脚镣手铐开去，并将衣服剥掉，而把二十三人抛在预先掘好的一个土坑内（在龙华塔的旁边）。国民党的创子手们就这样的结束了一幕残杀革命志士的拿手好戏！
    这样残酷的惨杀革命志士的行为，看守所中五百多个难友没有一个不切齿痛恨而悲愤万分的！
    林育南、李求实同志在狱中给党中央写了一个很长的报告，是交由互济会来连络的同志转上去的。胡也频同志在狱中写了一部小说，尚未完稿而被杀；他最后遗言：欲将该稿交给丁玲同志以留纪念。何孟雄同志在牺牲之前，早知不免一死，认为一个革命者为革命牺牲他宝贵的生命是份内事，所放心不下者只是两个心爱的稚子！但他并不因此而有所动摇。
    此次人民政协代表中有位王一帆同志，当时亦以革命奋斗而同系在狱中。他是亲眼目睹此一反动派残酷的惨杀革命志士的行为的。二个月前我与他在北京饭店见面时，他还特别提起我同案中最年轻、最聪明、最英勇、最壮烈的立安同志。可见立安同志虽以十八岁的童年，他革命的精神是深深地感动着每一个认识他的人的！
    中国革命的过程，是一部血和泪的历史。没有烈士们的鲜血，革命是不会成功的！立安同志等是为了建立中华人民的革命政权而牺牲的！他们为了中国人民的解放事业而贡献了他们全部的生命，贡献出他们最后的一点血！
    时间过去了已整整十九个年头了，无数的革命志士踏着先烈们的血迹奋斗！前进！到了今日，终于推翻了国民党反动派的统治，使中国人民获得了真正的解放和基本的胜利！烈士们的血是没有白流的！
    你是立安同志的母亲，我得向你致最崇高的敬礼与亲切的慰问！请告我地址，我要来拜望你。
