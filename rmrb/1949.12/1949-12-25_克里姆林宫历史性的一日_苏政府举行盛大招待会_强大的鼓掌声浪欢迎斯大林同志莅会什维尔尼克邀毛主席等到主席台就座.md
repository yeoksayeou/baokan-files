Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th: TASS, Moscow: On the 22nd, the Soviet government held a grand reception in the Kremlin to celebrate Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday.

　　In the magnificent St. George's Hall, one could see the outstanding marshals who mastered Stalin's military art during the war, and the esteemed scientists of whom the entire nation is proud. Artists and writers from various cities, and advanced workers from famous factories and manufacturing plants gathered together. Each of them spoke with sincere love and deep gratitude for Comrade Stalin, recalling their meetings and conversations with the great leader during both peacetime and wartime. This is understandable because in the Soviet Union, there is no sector of industry, agriculture, culture, science, engineering, or art to which Stalin has not devoted himself, has not been inspired by Comrade Stalin, or has escaped Stalin's keen eye.

　　The best men and women of Moscow, delegations from the various republics, special envoys of the Soviet people, representatives of the working people of various countries, and representatives of fraternal parties brought the warm congratulations of hundreds of millions of people to the Kremlin, and the name of Stalin is the closest and dearest to them.

　　The entire audience waited with joyful excitement to meet Stalin, and the entire venue was extremely excited, erupting in thunderous applause. Comrade Stalin, along with Comrades Molotov, Malenkov, Voroshilov, Beria, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Shvernik, Kosygin, Suslov, Ponomarenko, and Shkiryatov, entered the hall. The guests greeted Comrade Stalin with a storm of prolonged applause.

　　When presiding over the opening of the reception, Shvernik invited Mao Zedong, Chervenkov, Rakosi, Gheorghiu-Dej, Siroky, Togliatti, Ibárruri, Ulbricht, Yuzwiak, Bessi, and Collani to take seats on the presidium.

　　克里姆林宫历史性的一日
  　苏政府举行盛大招待会
    强大的鼓掌声浪欢迎斯大林同志莅会什维尔尼克邀毛主席等到主席台就座
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十二日，苏联政府在克里姆林宫举行了庆贺斯大林同志七十寿辰的盛大招待会。
    人们可以在宏伟的乔治也夫斯基大厅中看到那在战争中掌握了斯大林军事艺术的优秀的元帅，看到全国人民引为骄傲的可尊敬的科学家。各城市的艺术家和作家们、著名工厂和制造厂的先进工人们集会在一起。他们每一个都怀着对斯大林同志真诚热爱与深深感激的心情发言，追忆他们在和平时期与战争时期与伟大领袖会晤和交谈的情形。这是可以理解的，因为在苏联，没有一个工业、农业、文化、科学、工程与艺术部门，是斯大林未曾致力、未曾受过斯大林同志的鼓舞、或是逃脱了斯大林敏锐的眼光的。
    莫斯科最优秀的男女、各加盟共和国的代表团、苏联人民的专派、各国劳动人民的代表、各兄弟党的代表，把亿万人民的热烈祝贺带到了克里姆林宫，而斯大林的名字，对于他们来说是最亲近与最亲切的。
    全场均以欢欣的激动心情等待着和斯大林的会晤，全场兴奋异常，掀起了强大的鼓掌声浪。斯大林同志，莫洛托夫、马林科夫、伏罗希洛夫、贝利亚、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、赫鲁舍切夫、布尔加宁、什维尔尼克、柯西金、苏斯洛夫、波诺马林科、施基利亚托夫诸同志进入大厅。宾客们以暴风雨般的长时间的鼓掌来欢迎斯大林同志。
    什维尔尼克在主持招待会开幕时，邀请毛泽东、契尔文科夫、拉科西、乔治乌——德治、西罗基、托里亚蒂、伊巴露丽、乌布利希、尤兹维亚克、贝西及柯伦尼诸人到主席台就座。
