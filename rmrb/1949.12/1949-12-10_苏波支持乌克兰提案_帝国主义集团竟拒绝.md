　　The Soviet Union and Poland Support Ukrainian Proposal; Imperialist Bloc Rejects It
    Polish representative Katz-Suchy seconded the Ukrainian delegation's proposal. He pointed out that the fourteen-nation proposal should not be formally discussed because it was an attempt to bury the Indonesian issue before the Security Council had completed its review.
    After the Polish representative spoke, the chairman was eager to put the existing proposals to a vote. Despite the opposition of the Ukrainian and Belorussian representatives, the majority of the Special Political Committee still passed a resolution to end the discussion and put the proposed proposals to a vote, rudely violating the basic right of committee member states to participate in the discussion.
    The Special Political Committee then passed the fourteen-nation proposal with this majority. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. Then, in order to prevent the vote on the Ukrainian Republic delegation's proposal, the chairman put to a vote the question of whether this proposal conformed to Article 12 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the United Nations General Assembly cannot make recommendations on issues that are on the Security Council's agenda and are being discussed by the Security Council.
    The majority of the committee decided that the proposal of the Ukrainian Republic was a recommendation and, according to Article 12 of the United Nations Charter, could not be put to a vote. The committee thus refused to discuss and vote on the Ukrainian Republic's proposal, which was the only proper way to guarantee a solution to the Indonesian issue.

　　苏波支持乌克兰提案
    帝国主义集团竟拒绝
    波兰代表卡茨——苏琪继起附议乌克兰代表团的提案，他指出，十四国的提案，不容予以正式讨论，因为这是企图在安理会还没有结束其审查之前，就把印尼问题埋没起来。
    波兰代表发言之后，主席急于要把已有的提案提付表决，虽经乌克兰、白俄罗斯代表的反对，但特别政治委员会的多数竟仍通过了关于结束讨论并将已提出的提案交付表决的决议，粗鲁地侵犯了委员会委员国参加讨论的基本权利。
    特别政委会又以这个多数通过了十四国的提案。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克投票反对。然后，为了要阻挠乌克兰共和国代表团提案的表决，主席将关于这个提案是否符合联合国宪章第十二条规定这一问题提付表决，依照该条规定，联合国大会不能对于正在安理会议程上并且正在安理会讨论中的问题提出建议。
    委员会的多数议决：乌克兰共和国的提案是建议案，依照联合国宪章第十二条，不得提付表决。委员会就这样拒绝了讨论和表决乌克兰共和国的提案，这个提案是保证解决印尼问题的唯一正当途径。
