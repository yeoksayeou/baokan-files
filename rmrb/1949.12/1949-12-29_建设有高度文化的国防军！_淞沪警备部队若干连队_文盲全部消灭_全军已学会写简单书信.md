　　Build a Highly Cultured National Defense Army!
　　Several Companies of the Songhu Garrison Troops
　　Illiteracy Completely Eliminated
　　The Entire Army Has Learned to Write Simple Letters
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th] Since April, a certain unit of the Third Field Army garrisoning Songhu has universally launched cultural learning in its companies and has achieved remarkable results. Before this period, due to frequent combat and marching, there were not many learning opportunities, and the cultural level of the general cadres and soldiers was very low. Some companies even had more than 90% illiteracy. After four months of study, the company with the fastest progress had completely eliminated illiteracy. In general companies, only about 1% or 2% illiteracy remained. The average soldier can now recognize between 200 and 600 characters and can write ordinary wall newspaper articles and simple letters. Some companies have already enabled everyone to read the company reading materials "People's Warrior Primer" and "Stories of Mao Zedong."
　　When the unit called for launching a cultural learning campaign in the companies at the beginning of August this year, many commanders and fighters lacked confidence, and some still had incorrect ideas such as "it's useless for a roughneck to learn to read," "not knowing how to read can still win battles," and "being too old makes the brain useless." At the same time, the lack of cultural teachers, busy work, and insufficient study time also increased the difficulties in learning. In order to make everyone realize the importance of cultural learning, the unit held cadre meetings, military personnel meetings, etc., at the battalion or company level, repeatedly explaining the two questions of "is it necessary to learn" and "can we learn," so that everyone realized the principle that "without learning culture, one cannot be a regularized, modernized, literate and martial revolutionary soldier." After repeated mobilization, the fear of recognizing characters was dispelled, and cultural learning was universally launched in each company. During the learning process, the soldiers were very enthusiastic, and some even secretly recited lessons and practiced strokes with their fingers when they were sick.
　　Repeatedly discuss whether it is necessary to learn and whether it is possible to learn, and call for being a literate and martial revolutionary soldier.
　　The unit universally adopted the "little teacher" system in cultural learning and stipulated that newspapers should be read and diaries kept every day. In addition, each company universally adopted methods such as "mutual teaching and mutual learning" and "learn and teach immediately," dividing those who knew more characters and those who knew fewer into mutual aid groups, with those who were literate teaching those who were illiterate, and those who knew more characters teaching those who knew fewer. In order to help learning, the Third Company of a certain regiment also created a "work literacy board" method, that is, erecting a wooden board in a certain workplace, writing characters related to the work on the board, allowing soldiers to recognize characters while working. After the work was completed, the characters were also recognized.
　　In order to encourage learning, each unit specially allocated a portion of funds from production income to purchase necessary stationery. The soldiers also saved their allowances and consolation money to buy fountain pens, study notebooks, or company reading materials. Some regiments and companies also established small libraries. In addition, all companies in the army largely launched savings and donations, or withdrew funds from production savings to purchase a radio. The Songhu Garrison Political Department negotiated with the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station to stipulate "military broadcasting" time. During this time, all companies in the army gathered in front of the radio to listen to reports and learn to sing, thus greatly increasing the interest and efficiency of cultural learning. In order to supervise and exchange learning experiences, some regiments held weekly meetings by battalion to listen to reports, conduct summaries, and report achievements to the entire battalion, pointing out shortcomings. Some companies conducted a small summary of the day's learning during roll call, commending the good and criticizing the bad; others adopted various methods such as "evaluating progress" and testing to promote learning.
　　Currently, each company is universally establishing reading groups and soldier libraries in order to further improve cultural learning.

    建设有高度文化的国防军！
　　淞沪警备部队若干连队
    文盲全部消灭
　  全军已学会写简单书信
    【新华社上海二十七日电】警备淞沪的第三野战军某部，四月来在连队里普遍展开文化学习，已获显著成绩。该部在此时期以前，由于作战行军频繁，学习机会不多，一般干部、战士的文化水平很低，有的连队甚至有百分之九十以上的文盲经过四个月学习以后，进步最快的连队，文盲已全部消灭，一般连队，文盲仅余百分之一、二左右。一般战士已能认二百字至六百字，并能写普通墙报稿子和简单书信。有的连队已经人人能读连队读物“人民战士三字经”和“毛泽东故事”。
    当今年八月初该部号召在连队开展文化学习运动时，很多指战员们都缺乏信心，有些还存在“大老粗认字没有用”，“不识字一样打胜仗”，“年纪大了脑子不中用了”等不正确思想。同时缺少文化教员、工作忙碌、学习时间不够等，也都增加了学习上的困难。该部为了使大家认识文化学习的重要，特以营或连为单位举行干部会、军人大会等，反复说明“需不需要学”“能不能学”两个问题，使大家认识“不学文化就不能做好一个正规化、近代化、能文能武的革命军人”的道理，经过反复动员，打消了怕认字的顾虑，各连队便普遍展开了文化学习的热潮。在学习中，战士们的情绪很高，有的甚至生病的时候，还暗暗背诵课文，用手指练习笔画。
    反复研讨需不需要学、能不能学，号召作一个能文能武的革命军人。
    该部在文化学习中普遍采用小先生制，规定天天读报、记日记。此外，各连普遍采取了“互教互学”、“现学现教”等方法，把认字多的和认字少的编成互助组，识字的教不识字的，识字多的教识字少的。某团三连为了帮助学习，并创造了“做工识字牌”的办法，即在一定的工作场所竖上一块木牌，牌上写着与工作有关的字，让战士们一边做工一边识字，工作完后，字也都认得了。
    各部为鼓励学习，特从生产收入中，提出一部款项购买必要的文具。战士们也都纷纷节省津贴费、慰劳金来买钢笔、学习本或连队读物。有的团和连队还建立了小型图书馆。此外，全军各连队大部发动节约献金，或从生产节约收入中提款购置一个收音机，由淞沪警备政治部与上海人民广播电台商洽，规定“军人广播”时间，在此时间内，全军各连都集合在收音机前听报告、学唱歌，因此大大提高了文化学习的兴趣和效率。为了督促和交换学习经验，有的团以营为单位，每周召集会议，听取汇报，进行总结，向全营报告成绩，指出缺点。有的连在点名时，对一天学习进行小结，表扬好的，批评坏的；有的则采用“评进步”与测验等各种的方式推动学习。
    目前各连队正普遍建立读报小组和战士图书馆，以便把文化学习继续提高一步。
