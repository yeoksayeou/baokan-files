　　Unforgettable Day
  　Recollections of the "December 9th" Youth Student Movement
    Zhang Qiliang
    The "December 9th" Movement is fourteen years old; it is a great revolutionary youth movement's holiday.

    Since the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang dragged the Chinese nation into the darkest, most reactionary, and most critical period. The Japanese invaders seized the Northeast, attacked Shanghai, occupied Jehol, their iron hooves crossed the Great Wall, wanting to swallow North China, and then annex all of China. The Chiang bandit persisted in the traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policy, using airplanes and cannons supplied by imperialism to "suppress the communists" in Jiangxi, sending "big officials" to sign the "Tanggu Truce" and the "He-Umezu Agreement" with the Japanese invaders, and also issued an order to "cultivate friendly relations," forbidding the people from resisting Japan. By the early winter of 1935, the Japanese invaders launched a new offensive, the "Kwantung Army" entered the pass, increased troops in Tianjin and Beijing, and instigated a group of feudal warlords and traitors to engage in "autonomy" activities, establishing the "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government" in Tongzhou, and brewing the "Hebei-Chahar Political Council" in Beiping; Tianjin traitors rioted and occupied the Tianjin-Gukou Garrison Headquarters, and even wooed warlords such as Song Zheyuan and Han Fuqu to engage in North China autonomy, attempting to turn North China into a second puppet Manchukuo. The motherland was in crisis, and the national crisis had reached a critical juncture. The Chiang bandit still rigorously carried out his reactionary traitorous policy, and the Chinese people could no longer endure it. The CCP's "August 1st" Declaration called on the people of the whole country to rise up, stop the civil war, and unite to resist Japan, which was deeply supported by the people of the whole country. The youth of Beiping, standing on the front line of national defense, organized the "Beiping Student Union" to prepare to launch a national salvation movement.

    In early December, the situation became even tenser. Enemy planes with the Rising Sun flag circled over Beiping in groups every day to show off their power. Chiang bandit's "Fifth Plenary Session" decided to continue the policy of civil war and national betrayal, and dispatched the pro-Japanese traitor He Yingqin to the north to bargain with the Japanese invaders and sign traitorous clauses.

    It was time to act. "The Great North China can no longer accommodate a quiet desk!" (Declaration of the Beiping Student Union). The Beiping Student Union decided to hold a parade and petition on December 9th, putting forward the slogan of "United Resistance Against Japan, the people of the whole country rise up in unison." On the day before the demonstration (the 8th), representatives from various schools met at Yenching University in Haidian. The Student Union conveyed the resolution of the next day's action. The representatives of various schools, with tense and excited hearts, went back to their schools to convey the resolution and prepare for action.

    On the morning of the 9th, four or five hundred students from Tsinghua University gathered on the playground and formed a discipline squad, a propaganda squad, and a transportation squad, etc. Before seven o'clock, the team set off. Along the way, they broke through the police's obstruction, crossed the stone bridge outside Xizhimen, and joined up with the Yenching University students at Chengguan. When they reached the Xizhimen city gate, the gate was tightly closed, with a large team of armed police lined up outside. Someone came to "persuade" the students, but the students resolutely refused to go back. The large team of students persisted in the bitter cold wind.

    Students from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities sent representatives to negotiate with the military police, but to no avail. Finally, a part of the students was left to guard Xizhimen, and the large team moved south, planning to enter from another city gate. They shouted loud slogans along the way.

    On the way to Fuchengmen, they passed two middle schools. They poked their heads out of the classroom windows to respond to us, and sent representatives over the frozen moat to ask for some leaflets and slogans, and immediately organized themselves to join our team.

    Fuchengmen was closed, Xibianmen was also closed, and even the iron gate for the train was closed. Everyone stopped here for a long time. The train also did not drive into the city, cutting off traffic for the day. Facing the northwest wind, running for a day, the students were not tired at all, chewing cold steamed buns in the cold wind. At more than four o'clock in the afternoon, the transportation team sent a message saying: "He Yingqin's representative is coming to speak at Xizhimen." The team then returned to Xizhimen. When they arrived at Xizhimen, they heard that He Yingqin's representative only said an irresponsible sentence in the city gate seam and slipped away. At this time, it was getting dark, and the chief representative, a female student named Lu Cui, was speaking. She held a loudspeaker and talked about the significance of the parade and petition and the course of events.

    More than nine hundred students persisted in the cold wind for a day, and their morale was always high. During the action, they recognized the Chiang bandit's deception, national betrayal, and anti-people nature, and further recognized the power of the collective. After dark, the students returned to school, resolved to strike, and telegraphed compatriots across the country to rise up together to save the nation. In order to protest the reactionary atrocities of the Chiang bandit government, it was decided to hold another large demonstration. Soon, on December 16th, the students outside the city physically crashed open the iron gate and joined the students inside the city, holding a mass rally of more than 10,000 citizens at Tianqiao. During the winter vacation, students from Beiping and Tianjin formed an expanded propaganda group to go to the countryside, met in Gu'an, and established a long-term organization - the National Liberation Vanguard.

    Thus, a new action began!

　　难忘的这一天
  　“一二九”青年学生运动回忆片断
    张启亮
    “一二九”运动十四周年了，它是个伟大的青年革命运动的节日。
    自一九三一年“九一八”以来，蒋匪帮把中华民族拖进最黑暗、最反动、最危急的时期。日寇抢占东北，进攻上海，侵占热河，铁蹄跨过了长城，想鲸吞华北，进而并吞全中国。蒋匪坚持卖国独裁内战政策，用帝国主义供给的飞机大炮到江西去“剿共”，派来“大员”和日寇订立“塘沽协定”，“何梅协定”，又下了“敦睦邦交”令，不许人民抗日。到一九三五年初冬，日寇更发动了新侵略攻势，“关东军”开进关内，平津增兵，策动一批封建军阀、汉奸活动“自治”，在通县成立“冀东防共自治政府”，在北平酝酿“冀察政委会”；天津汉奸暴动占领津沽保安司令部，更拉拢哲元、韩复渠等军阀搞华北自治，企图把华北当成第二个伪满。祖国在危难中，民族危机已到了严重关头，蒋匪仍厉行其反动的卖国政策，中国人民再也不能忍受了。中共“八一”宣言，号召全国人民奋起，停止内战，一致抗日，深得到全国人民的拥护。站在国防最前线的北平青年，组织了“北平市学生联合会”，准备开展救亡运动。
    十二月初，局势更紧张了，膏药旗的敌机每天成群的在北平上空盘旋示威，蒋匪“五全大会”决定继续内战卖国政策，并派遣亲日派汉奸头子何应钦北来，和日寇讨价还价，订立卖国条款。
    是行动的时候了，“华北之大是再也安放不下一张安静的书桌了！”（平市学联会宣言），北平市学联会决定在十二月九日举行游行请愿，提出“联合抗日，全国人民一致奋起”的口号。在示威头一天（八日）各校代表在海淀燕京大学开会，学联会传达了第二天行动的决议，各校代表怀着紧张、振奋的心情，分头回校传达决议，准备行动。
    九号早晨，清华学生在大操场上集合了四五百人，成立了纠察队，宣传队，交通队等，不到七点钟，大队就出发了。一路上冲破警察的阻拦，过了西直门外的石桥，在城关处和燕大同学汇合。走到西直门城门，门是紧闭着，外边排列着一大队武装警察，有人来对学生“劝说”了，但同学们坚决不回去，大队同学在凛冽的寒风中坚持着。
    清华、燕大两校学生派了代表和军警交涉，毫无结果，最后留了一部分同学把守西直门，大队向南行动，打算从别的城门进去。一路上喊着响亮的口号。
    在到阜城门的途中，经过了两个中学，他们从课堂窗口中探出头来，响应我们，并派代表从冻了的护城河上过来，要了些传单、标语，回去立刻组织起来，加入我们的队伍。
    阜城门关了，西便门也关了，连过火车的铁门也关了，大家在这里停了好久。火车也没有驶进城去，断绝了一天的交通。顶着西北风，跑了一天，同学们一点也不疲倦，在寒风里嚼着凉馒头。下午四点多钟的时候，交通队传信说：“西直门有何应钦的代表来讲话。”大队便又回到西直门。到了西直门，听说何应钦的代表只在城门缝中说了句不负责任的话就溜走了。这时天也黑下来，总代表女同学陆璀在讲话了，她拿着喇叭筒，讲述了游行请愿意义和经过情形。
    九百多同学在寒风中坚持了一天，情绪始终是高涨的。在行动当中认清了蒋匪的欺骗、卖国、反人民，更认识了集体的力量。天黑后，同学们才回校，决议罢课，并通电全国同胞共起救亡。为了抗议蒋匪反动政府的暴行，决定再举行一次大示威。不久，在十二月十六日那天，城外的学生用肉体撞开了铁门，和城内同学汇合，在天桥召开了万余人的市民大会。到寒假中，平津同学组成扩大宣传团下乡，在固安大会合，成立了长期性的组织——民族解放先锋队。
    于是，一个新的行动开始了！
