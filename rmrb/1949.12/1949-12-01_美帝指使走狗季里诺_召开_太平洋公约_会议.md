Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th — According to a dispatch from TASS London on the 28th, in view of the disastrous defeat of U.S. imperialism in China and the subsequent "re-ordering" of U.S. Far Eastern policy, the United States is actively directing Quirino to convene a conference in Manila to discuss the conclusion of an aggressive "Pacific Pact." During a meeting in Washington in October between representatives of the U.S. State Department, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and Philippine representative to the United Nations, Romulo, an agreement was reached determining that India would assume the role of so-called "spiritual leader" of the Pacific Pact. Specific proposals will be put forward by Nehru to representatives of other Southeast Asian countries. This pact will supplement the "U.S.-India Military and Political Agreement" drafted by the chiefs of staff of the U.S. and India. The meeting is expected to take place around January or February of next year. Representatives from India, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, South Korea, the Kuomintang, and Indonesia, as well as observers from Australia, will attend the meeting.

　　美帝指使走狗季里诺
  　召开“太平洋公约”会议
    【新华社北京三十日电】据电通社伦敦二十八日讯，由于美国帝国主义在中国的惨败和随之而来的美国远东政策的“重订”，美国正积极指使季里诺在马尼拉召开一个讨论缔结侵略性“太平洋公约”的会议。美国国务院代表、印度总理尼赫鲁与菲律宾驻联合国代表罗慕洛，十月间在华盛顿举行会议时，曾达成一项协议，决定印度将担任所谓太平洋公约“精神领导”的角色。具体的建议将由尼赫鲁向其他东南亚国家的代表提出。这个公约将补充以美印两国参谋长所拟成的“美印军政协定”。开会的时间大约在明年一月或二月。出席会议的，将有印度、菲律宾、缅甸、泰国、南朝鲜、国民党及印尼的代表，和澳大利亚的观察员。
