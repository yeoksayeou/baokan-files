Methods of Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Hua Bei University, Second Division, Su Xing

    In order to cultivate each member's sense of principle and spirit of collectivism, and to infuse the life of the League with vigorous vitality, criticism and self-criticism should become one of the branch's daily tasks. Facts have proven that whichever branch firmly and resolutely uses this weapon, the life of that branch exhibits progress and unity; conversely, it inevitably becomes scattered and stagnant. Therefore, the leading comrades of the branch should elevate the work of continuously studying and learning to use this weapon to an important position.

    Recently, in our League life, the following shortcomings exist in the use of criticism and self-criticism: in terms of content, it often cannot escape the circle of trivial matters of life, and these small problems are stiffly elevated to a "matter of principle"; conversely, it neglects principled debates on political and organizational matters. There are also unrealistic phenomena in the attitude of criticism, and in terms of methods, it often adopts the old routine of self-criticism meetings, rotating self-criticism, which becomes formalism. If these phenomena are not corrected immediately, it will weaken the effectiveness of criticism and self-criticism.

    Therefore, the Social Sciences Department branch of Hua Bei University, Second Division, held a special discussion on "How to Carry Out Criticism and Self-Criticism?" Because this issue was widespread among League members, it aroused the interest of every member. At the beginning of the meeting, one comrade raised the issue: "Our department's group self-criticism meetings are not going well. On the one hand, it is limited by my own political level, but on the other hand, it is also because it is reduced to a formalistic A, B, C, criticism for the sake of criticism. Usually, everyone rarely offers opinions to each other, and there is not enough mutual concern, but at the meeting, a lot of things suddenly emerge, making it difficult for the person being criticized to accept, and therefore it is not very helpful..." Once the problem was raised, the discussion unfolded. They first reviewed the unrealistic attitude in criticism, and there were even such things: one League member was the study committee member, and she enthusiastically took care of the patients, but someone criticized her behavior as not being based on mutual aid and friendship, but for showing off her personal work; therefore, after the criticism, she did not know what to do. Some comrades reviewed the absolutist attitude in criticism, and the phenomenon of not distinguishing between principled and non-principled issues. They also reviewed the morbid psychology of self-esteem and saving face that does not accept criticism. Some people even regarded others' criticism as "looking down on themselves" due to inferiority. Their discussion did not start from empty principles, but was based on facts. Why did one criticism have an effect, while another had the opposite effect? In the final summary, they affirmed the achievements of criticism and self-criticism, and realized what the correct attitude should be. This meeting improved the members' use of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and strengthened unity. They introduced this experience at this joint meeting of the League branch committees.

    At the joint meeting of the League branch committees, the Education Department branch also made an introduction on criticism and self-criticism. In their branch, there were two League members who were originally decided by the organization to study in the undergraduate program; however, they returned to the Education Department halfway, and after arriving at the Education Department, they requested to return to the undergraduate program; this time, the organization assigned them to work in Xikang, and they said they were willing to go, but later wavered, showing a series of serious individualistic behaviors. Therefore, the branch held a self-criticism meeting for them, first educating them to recognize their mistakes, conduct self-criticism, and then make a report at the meeting. This meeting also invited some of the masses to participate. At the meeting, the self-criticism of the two people was not deep enough, but the people who attended the meeting patiently analyzed the roots of their thoughts, pointing out the harm of individualism to their progress. Therefore, this meeting not only improved the ideological understanding of the two of them, but also greatly educated the masses present, especially making some comrades who had the same ideological problems realize the seriousness of their shortcomings, and therefore more eagerly demanded their own transformation; they saw that individualism and collectivism could not coexist, and to make revolution, they must resolutely fight against individualism. Many non-League masses were not only educated ideologically, but also realized how the League loves and educates its members. Immediately after the meeting, some people applied to join the League.

    On the same day as this meeting, the League group of Class One of the Education Department, in conjunction with the student union, held a conference in another form to bid farewell to Comrade Yang Shuqin, who was going to work in Xikang.

    At the meeting, she happily spoke about her feelings about leaving the school to work, saying: "I feel that the organization can arrange me in the place where the revolution needs me most, it is simply too glorious, I am determined to go." "The revolutionary cause is like a large machine, we must be a screw, these screws are big, small, thick and thin, and the organization must arrange where it is suitable and effective to put it in the screw hole." More than half of the students at the meeting were moved, and some comrades stood in front of the leader's portrait and excitedly expressed their determination to obey the organization and dedicate themselves to the revolutionary cause.

    Based on the above three introductions of methods of criticism and self-criticism (although it still has shortcomings), we can obtain the following points of experience:

    First, criticism and self-criticism is a serious ideological struggle, and it is one of the specific forms of bringing Marxism-Leninism into ideological life. Therefore, the branch should strengthen leadership with a serious and responsible attitude and educate members to be good at using this weapon. Here, we are required to constantly strengthen the education of League members in Marxism-Leninism through practical issues - this is the standard of criticism and self-criticism. The reason why some of our new League members cannot go deep in criticism and self-criticism, apart from subjective reasons, is that they have not yet grasped this standard. Therefore, at the beginning of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, they often circle around trivial matters of life, which is unavoidable. The important thing is that our branch work can quickly guide them to raise their concerns to political principle issues. Today, it has already been seen that mere review of some trivial matters of life can no longer meet the requirements of League members.

    Second, criticism and self-criticism is not a "fashionable commodity," but a frequently used weapon of unity and progress. Therefore, we should oppose the attitude of not caring about and helping comrades to correct their shortcomings in peacetime, waiting only to criticize at meetings, and then everything is fine after the meeting. Without daily continuous understanding and concern, criticism will become impractical. Holding self-criticism meetings and discussion meetings are just a mass education method of criticism and self-criticism, which is an important method, but not the only one.

    In the branch meeting and group meeting, it is necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism, first of all, there must be a center, which can face the common and large number of problems, and then break through one point, and educate the masses through one or two specific people and specific things; or based on facts, everyone reviews and discusses, improves and unifies everyone's understanding. In fact, there are many typical examples in our daily life, and the problems of League members themselves (such as comrade relations, what is the role of backbone, family problems, and development prospects). The branch should be good at discovering typical examples and facing up to the existing problems, and use League members themselves or their own problems to educate League members.

    Third, we must be good at using model examples as educational materials (like bidding farewell to Yang Shuqin). In our branch work, we are often accustomed to reviewing and criticizing, but not good at praising, and not good at cherishing the progressive buds growing in the thoughts and actions of League members, which is not right. Praise is another form of criticism and self-criticism, and if used well, it will become a banner for educating the masses to progress. This requires our branch leaders to always have a keen sense of new things, see new things, and vigorously support and promote them, and in practice there are many such things.

### 批评与自我批评的方式

　　批评与自我批评的方式
    华北大学二部  苏星
    为了培养每个团员的原则性与集体主义的精神，并使团的生活充沛着活泼的生命力，批评与自我批评应成为支部的日常工作之一。事实证明：那个支部正确的坚决的使用了这个武器，那个支部的团的生活就呈现着前进与团结的现象；反之，就不免涣散与停滞。因此，支部的领导同志就应该把不断地研究与学习运用这个武器的工作，提到一个重要的位置。
    最近在我们团的生活中，在运用批评与自我批评这个问题上，存在着这样的缺点：在内容上往往摆脱不开生活琐事的圈子，而把这些小问题生硬地提高到“原则的高度”；相反的倒忽视了政治上组织上的原则性的争论。在批评态度上也有着不切实际的现象，在方式上则常常采用老一套的检讨会，轮流检讨，变成了形式主义。这些现象如果不即时加以纠正，是会削弱批评与自我批评的效用的。
    因此，华大二部社会科学系支部曾特别开过一次讨论会，讨论了“怎样展开批评与自我批评？”由于这个问题在团员中普遍存在着，就引起了每个团员的兴趣。会一开始，就有一个同志提出来：“我们系里的小组检讨会开的不很好，固然一方面是受到本人政治水平的限制，但一方面也因为流于形式上的Ａ、Ｂ、Ｃ，为批评而批评。平常大家很少互相提意见，彼此关心不够，在会上却一大堆都涌出来，使被检讨的人不能接受，因此帮助不大……。”问题提出来就展开了讨论。他们首先检讨了在批评上不切实际的态度，甚至有过这样的事情：有一个团员是学委，她热心地照顾病号，有人却批评她的行为不是从互助友爱出发，是为了表现个人的工作；因此批评之后使她左右不是。有的同志检讨了在批评上绝对化的态度，和原则问题与非原则问题不分的现象。又检讨了不接受批评的自尊心与爱面子的病态心理。有的人竟由于自卑，而把别人的批评看作是“看不起自己”。他们的讨论不是从空洞的原则出发，而是根据事实。那一次批评为什么收到了效果，而另一次则为什么恰恰相反。最后总结时，他们肯定了批评与自我批评的成绩，认识到怎样才是正确的态度。这个会使团员在运用批评与自我批评这个武器上提高了一步，同时加强了团结。他们把这个经验在这次团的支委联席会上作了介绍。
    在团支委联席会上教育系支部也作了一个关于批评与自我批评的介绍。在他们支部里有两个团员，组织上曾决定他们到本科学习；但他们中途回到了教育系，到了教育系后，又要求回本科；这次组织上分配他们到西康去工作，他们说愿意去，但后来又动摇了，表现了一连串的严重的个人主义的行为。因此，支部为他们开了一次检讨会，事先教育他们认识了错误，进行自我批评，再到会上作报告。这个会还邀请了一部分群众参加。在会上两个人的检讨还是不够深刻的，但参加会的人则耐心的分析了他们的思想根源，指出了个人主义对他们进步的危害性。因此，这个会不仅提高了他们两个人的思想认识，更大大地教育了与会的群众，尤其使一部分存在着同样的思想问题的同志，认识到自己缺点的严重性，因而更迫切地要求自己改造；他们看到个人主义和集体主义的不能并存，要革命就一定要和个人主义坚决作斗争。许多团外群众，他们不但受到这样一个思想教育，而且认识到团是怎样爱护与教育团员的。会后立即了有人申请入团。
    在和这个会的同一天，在教育系一班的团小组结合学生会，则用另一种形式主办了一个欢送叫杨述勤的女同志到西康去的大会。
    在会上，她愉快的讲出了她对出校工作的感想，她说：“我觉得组织能把我安排在革命最需要的地方，简直是太光荣了，我坚决要去。”“革命事业好比一个大机器，我们要做一个螺丝钉，这钉有大、有小、有粗、有细，放在那一个螺丝孔里合适，有效用，非要组织来安排不可。”会上有过半数同学被感动了，有的同志站在领袖像前激动地表示他服从组织的决心，为革命事业献出自己。
    根据以上三种批评与自我批评的方式的介绍（尽管它还存在着缺点），我们可以得到下列几点经验：
    第一，批评与自我批评是一个严重的思想斗争，是把马列主义带进思想生活里来的具体形式之一。因此支部要以严肃认真的态度来加强领导，并教育团员善于运用这个武器。在这里要求我们经常不断地通过实际问题加强对团员马列主义的教育——这是批评与自我批评的标准。我们有些新团员同志之所以在批评与自我批评上不能深入，除了主观上的原因，就在于他们还没有掌握了这个标准。因此，刚一开始进行批评与自我批评常在生活琐事上兜圈子，这是不可避免的，重要的是我们支部工作能够迅速的引导他们提高到关心政治原则问题上来。今天，就已经看到，只仅一些生活琐事的检讨，已经不能满足团员同志们的要求了。
    第二，批评与自我批评不是“时髦货”，而是经常使用的团结与进步的武器。因此就应该反对平时不关心和帮助同志改正缺点，专等会上批评，会后又完事大吉的态度，没有日常的不断的了解与关心，就会使批评不切实际。开检讨会，讨论会，只是批评与自我批评的群众教育方式，它是重要的方式，但不是唯一的。
    在支部会，小组会上进行批评与自我批评，首先要有中心，能面对普遍而大量存在的问题，然后突破一点，通过一两个具体人具体事来教育群众；或者根据事实，大家检讨和讨论，提高和统一大家的认识。实际上存在于我们日常生活中的典型事例，团员切身的问题（如同志关系、什么叫骨干作用、家庭问题、发展前途问题）是很多的，支部应该善于发见典型，正视存在的问题用团员自己或自己的问题教育团员。
    第三，要善于用模范事例作为教育材料（像欢送杨述勤那样），我们在支部工作中常常习惯于检讨、批评，而不善于表扬，不善于宝贵生长在团员思想行动上的进步的幼芽，这是不应该的。表扬是批评与自我批评的另一种形式，运用的好，就会成为教育群众进步的旗帜。这就要求我们支部的领导同志经常的对新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉，看到新生的东西，大力的扶植与发扬它，而在实际生活中这样的东西是存在着不少的。
