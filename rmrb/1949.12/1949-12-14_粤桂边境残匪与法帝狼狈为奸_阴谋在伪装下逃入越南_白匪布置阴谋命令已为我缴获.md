Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: The remnant Kuomintang bandit troops, suffering devastating blows on the Guangdong-Guangxi border, are colluding with French imperialism, preparing to flee into Vietnam under the guise of the so-called "Vietnamese Volunteer Army." According to the plan of the two bandits, Bai Chongxi and Xia Wei, approximately 10,000 remnants of the 14th, 97th, and 71st armies belonging to the Kuomintang bandit army's First Army Corps will first enter Lang Son in northeastern Vietnam from near Sile on the southwestern border of Guangxi, and cooperate with the French colonial army to launch a surprise attack on the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army in the Lang Son, Dao He Kou, and Hai Phong areas. In order to conceal their true identities, the Kuomintang bandit troops entering Vietnam will be under the command of Nguyen Van Xuan, the Minister of National Defense of the French puppet Bao Dai government, and Vu Hong Khanh, a member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. If they ultimately fail to gain a foothold in Vietnam, they plan to cross the sea from Hai Phong, Vietnam, and transfer to Haikou on Hainan Island.

The collusion between the Kuomintang bandit gang and the imperialists has been going on for a long time. In May of this year, the bandit Song Ziwen went to France under the pretext of recuperating, buying arms in Europe while also discussing with Western European imperialist governments the retreat routes of the bandit army in case of failure, planning to turn the area bordering Vietnam, Burma, and China into an anti-communist base on the Asian continent. Before and after the liberation of Guangzhou, the Guangdong-Guangxi bandit gangs, seeing the critical situation, sent secret envoys to Vietnam to negotiate directly with the French authorities there, agreeing that the bandit gangs would disguise themselves as "Vietnamese Volunteer Army" and enter Vietnam under the command of Nguyen Van Xuan or Vu Hong Khanh in case of failure. At the same time, the Gui faction sent Cheng Siyuan to Macau to negotiate with French representatives, the result of which was the decision that after the Kuomintang remnant bandits entered Vietnam, they must cooperate with the French army to attack the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 13th: Under the instigation of imperialism, the bandit Bai Chongxi is gathering the remnants of the defeated troops on the Guangdong-Guangxi border, plotting to retreat into Vietnam, and organizing the so-called "Vietnamese Volunteer Army." The order from bandit Bai outlining this conspiracy has been captured by our front-line troops. This order was issued by bandit Bai on the 8th of this month to bandit Bai's "Deputy Commander" Xia Wei, and forwarded by Xia Wei to other Gui faction remnant bandit leaders. The full text of the telegram is as follows: "In order to develop and survive in the future, organize the Vietnamese Volunteer Army. Appoint Vu Hong Khanh as Commander-in-Chief, Xu Qiming as Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Tan Heyi as Deputy Army Commander of the First Army, and Yao Huai as Deputy Army Commander of the Second Army. Try to have the Vietnamese recommend candidates for army division commanders; the incumbent army division commanders may temporarily serve as deputies to rally support. Politically, support Bao Dai; militarily, cooperate with the French army, and seek to conquer Ho Chi Minh's main forces. If the enemy troops (referring to the Chinese People's Liberation Army) follow and attack Vietnam, it will become a complex international issue, and the United States cannot sit idly by, which is beneficial to us (referring to the Kuomintang bandit army)." Vu Hong Khanh in this telegram is a Vietnamese Nationalist Party member, and Xu Qiming and Tan Heyi are both leaders of the Gui faction bandit army.

　　粤桂边境残匪与法帝狼狈为奸
    阴谋在伪装下逃入越南
    白匪布置阴谋命令已为我缴获
    【新华社北京十三日电】在粤桂边境遭受歼灭性打击的国民党匪军残部，正与法帝国主义勾结，准备在所谓“越南志愿军”的伪装下逃入越南境内。根据白崇禧、夏威两匪的计划，国民党匪军一兵团所属的第十四军、九十七军和七十一军残部约万人，将首由广西西南边境思乐附近进入越南东北部的谅山，配合法国殖民军，在谅山、道河口、海防一带，予越南人民解放军以出其不意的袭击。为了掩蔽自己的面目起见，进入越南的国民党匪军，将归法国傀儡保大政府的国防部长阮文春和越南国民党人武鸿卿指挥。如果最后仍然无法在越南立足，则准备经越南海防渡海转到海南岛的海口。
    国民党匪帮与帝国主义这一狼狈为奸的阴谋进行已久。本年五月，宋匪子文以养病为名赴法，一面在欧洲购办军火，同时即与西欧的帝国主义政府商讨匪军失败时的退路，计划将越南、缅甸与中国交界的地带造成为亚洲大陆的反共基地。广州解放前后，粤桂匪帮以形势危急，就派了密使到越南与该地法国当局直接谈判，议定匪帮于失败时化装为“越南志愿军”进入越南，由阮文春或武鸿卿指挥。同时，桂系又派程思远赴澳门，与法方代表商谈，其结果是决定国民党残匪入越后，必须配合法军进攻越南人民解放军。
    【新华社广州十三日电】白匪崇禧在帝国主义指使下，正在收拾粤桂边的残兵败将，阴谋退入越南，并组织所谓“越南志愿军”。白匪布置这一阴谋的命令已为前线我军所缴获。这个命令是白匪在本月八日发给白匪的“副长官”夏威，并由夏威转给其他桂系残匪首领的。该电全文如下：“为将来发展生存计，组织越南志愿军。以武鸿卿为总司令，徐启明为副总司令，谭何易为第一军副军长，姚槐为第二军副军长。军师人选尽量由越方推荐，原任军师长可暂任副职，以资号召。政治上拥护保大，军事上与法军合作，求胡志明主力而攻略之。若敌军（按指中国人民解放军）尾随攻越，则成国际复杂问题，美国不能坐视，于我（按指国民党匪军）有利。”此电中的武鸿卿是越南国民党分子，徐启明、谭何易都是桂系匪军的头目。
