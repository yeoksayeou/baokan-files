Enthusiastically Responding to Chairman Mao's Call for the Army to Participate in Production and Construction
    The North China Military Region Production Committee Actively Deploys Next Year's Great Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The North China Military Region, in order to implement Chairman Mao's "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Production and Construction Work in 1950" issued on December 5th of this year, specially convened an enlarged meeting of the Production Committee in the capital on the 20th of this month. Zhu Liangcai, Tang Yanjie, Yang Chengwu, Li Tianhuan, Zhou Wenlong, members of the Military Region Production Committee, and responsible comrades from the 20th Army Corps, various provincial military regions, directly subordinate divisions, and directly subordinate units, totaling more than 40 people, attended the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Zhu Liangcai, Director of the Military Region Production Committee, conveyed and reported the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions and the discussion outline for the North China Military Region's production work for next year. All comrades present unanimously expressed their agreement with Comrade Zhu Liangcai's report, and supported and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and the Military Region's production work plan for next year.
    The meeting clearly stipulated that the army's participation in production should not be temporary, but should proceed from the perspective of long-term construction, and that the focus should be on increasing the wealth of society and the country through labor. To this end, the following items must be grasped tightly: (A) agriculture and its sideline occupations, (B) water conservancy and construction projects, (C) animal husbandry, (D) workshops and factories, (E) transportation undertakings, (F) fisheries, and other productions (such as weaving mats, papermaking, firing kilns, chopping firewood...). With agriculture (including large-scale farms and small-scale farms, land reclamation) and its sideline occupations (such as pig farming and chicken farming), and workshops (such as flour mills, oil mills, and gristmills) as the main focus. And organize two-thirds to three-fifths of the troops to participate in water conservancy construction projects in a certain period to reduce water disasters and develop water conservancy.
    Regarding the production organization structure, the meeting determined to establish production committees at all levels above the division (sub-district) level in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, to grasp the direction of production, examine and approve and supervise the implementation of production plans, and inspect illegal activities. Under the leadership of the committee, establish production cooperatives at all levels to manage all production funds, production activities, and the handling of production results.
    The meeting, based on Chairman Mao's principle of "considering both public and private interests," determined that the profits from production harvests, after deducting costs, should be distributed according to the following percentages: 40 percent for individuals (to be freely disposed of by individuals), 20 percent for the unit (to improve the unit's living standards), 20 percent for the unit's reinvestment capital, and 20 percent for the state (i.e., the self-sufficiency portion).
    The meeting also emphasized prohibiting engaging in commerce, and not violating policies and laws, and when carrying out agricultural production, do not cause water disasters due to land reclamation, or cause popular dissatisfaction due to land disputes.
    The meeting called on all commanders and fighters of the army to strengthen their study and research of the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, and for leading organs at all levels to strengthen the propaganda and mobilization work for production, to enlighten the army's awareness of production, to actively plan and carry out production preparations, and to welcome the great production movement next year.

    【本报讯】华北军区为执行毛主席本年十二月五日“关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示”，特于本月二十日，在首都召开生产委员会扩大会。出席军区生产委员朱良才、唐延杰、杨成武、李天焕、周文龙暨二十兵团、各省军区、各直属师、直属单位负责同志共四十余人。会议首由军区生产委员会朱良才主任传达报告毛主席该项指示的精神和华北军区明年生产工作讨论提纲。到会全体同志一致表示同意朱良才同志的报告，拥护并坚决执行毛主席的指示和军区明年生产工作的计划。
    会议明确规定：军队参加生产，不是临时的，应从长期建设的观点出发，而其重点则在于以劳动增加社会和国家的财富。为此，须抓紧下列诸项：（甲）农业业及其副业，（乙）水利与建筑工程，（丙）畜牧业，（丁）作坊工场，（戊）运输事业，（己）渔业以及其他生产（如编席、造纸、烧窑、打柴……）。而以农业（包括大规模农场与小型农场、垦荒）及其副业（如养猪、养鸡）、作坊（如粉坊、油坊、磨坊）为主。并在一定时期组织二分之一至三分之二的部队参加水利建筑工程，以减免水灾，发展水利。
    关于生产组织机构，会议确定按照毛主席的指示，成立师（分区）以上各级生产委员会，以掌握生产方向，审定并监督生产计划的实施，检查违法行为。在委员会领导之下建立各级生产合作社以管理全部生产资金、生产活动和生产结果的处理。
    会议根据毛主席“公私兼顾”的原则，确定：生产收获除去成本以外之盈利，按个人百分之四十（归个人自由支配），单位百分之二十（改善单位生活）、单位再生产资本百分之二十、国家百分之二十（即自给部分）的比例去分配。
    会议并强调禁止从事商业，不得违犯政策法令，在进行农业生产时不要因开荒引起水患，因争地引起人民不满。
    会议号召全军指战员加强学习研究毛主席指示的精神，各级领导机关要加强生产的宣传、动员工作，启发全军对生产的自觉性，积极计划与进行生产准备，迎接明年大生产运动。
