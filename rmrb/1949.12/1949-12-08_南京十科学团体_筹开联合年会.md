　　Nanjing Ten Scientific Organizations
  　Preparing to Hold Joint Annual Meeting
    [Nanjing News] The Nanjing Branch of the China Society of Natural Sciences, along with the Chinese Astronomical Society, the Chinese Geophysical Society, the Chinese Meteorological Society, the Chinese Geographical Society, the Chinese Chemical Society, the Chinese Zoological Society, the Chinese Botanical Society, the Nanjing Branches of the Chinese Soil Science Society, and the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Society, a total of ten scientific organizations, considering that no academic gatherings have been held since liberation, are preparing to hold a joint annual meeting. The purpose is, on the one hand, to give members the opportunity to exchange academic research and seek scientific improvement; on the other hand, to enable the various societies to connect with the public and promote science popularization. After more than three weeks of preparation, it was decided to hold a joint annual meeting on December 10th and 11th. The general meeting on the morning of the 10th is expected to invite the city's Party, government, and military leaders to speak, and each society will report on the progress of past work. In the afternoon, each society will hold separate meetings to report on research and discuss society affairs. The general meeting on the morning of the 11th will discuss special topics such as the construction of natural science in Nanjing and other proposals. In the afternoon, science teachers from various middle schools in the city will be invited to hold subject-specific teaching seminars. It is also planned to hold a science popularization week during the meeting, with members of various societies giving science lectures at various middle schools and radio lectures on People's Broadcasting Station.
