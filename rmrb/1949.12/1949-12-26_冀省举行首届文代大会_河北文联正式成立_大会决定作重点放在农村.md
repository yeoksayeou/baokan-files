    【Baoding Dispatch】The first Congress of Literary and Art Workers of Hebei Province was held in Baoding from the 10th to the 18th. The delegates included 243 professional and amateur literary and art workers from provincial-level organizations, groups, military units, and special districts, cities, counties, and towns, as well as 37 guests from various places. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jin Cheng, Minister of Propaganda, and Sun Yi, Commander of the Hebei Military Region, all attended the meeting to provide guidance. This conference exchanged and summarized the achievements and experiences of literary and artistic work in various parts of Hebei Province since the War of Resistance Against Japan. Based on the specific conditions of the province, the conference determined the guiding principles and tasks for carrying out mass literary and art movements in the future, formulated the organizational charter of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and established the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The conference also suggested that each province-administered city establish a city federation of literary and art circles; counties, towns, and some areas with a relatively solid foundation for mass literary and art movements should selectively and gradually establish mass literary and art organizations. The conference also accepted and processed 101 proposals and arranged and specifically discussed the entertainment work for the 1950 Spring Festival. This conference unprecedentedly and broadly united the literary and art workers of the entire province. The delegates unanimously accepted the literary and art policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and discussed specific implementation methods. Based on the specific conditions of Hebei Province, it was determined that literary and artistic work in the future must focus on rural areas, while also paying attention to the development of urban literary and artistic work. The conference had a heated discussion on actively developing new literature and art and vigorously reforming old literature and art. It was unanimously believed that old literature and art still had a considerable social base, and that reforming old literature and art was an arduous and urgent task in carrying out the new literature and art movement, and that reforms must be carried out step by step and systematically using mass criticism methods. Among them, regarding the issue of old opera reform, the conference decided to focus on reforming local operas, and at the same time, under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, to carry out the reform of Peking Opera in a planned manner and establish the Hebei Provincial Opera Reform Committee. In addition, the conference also passed a proposal to issue literary and art awards in a planned manner to reward outstanding creations. Finally, the conference held elections, and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles was formally established, electing Hu Su as director, and Shen Shen and Hong Tao as deputy directors.
