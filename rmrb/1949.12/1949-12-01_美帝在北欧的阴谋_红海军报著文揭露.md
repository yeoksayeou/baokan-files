　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The Red Navy Newspaper recently published an article by Semenov exposing the conspiracy of American militarists in Northern Europe. The author wrote: The naval region of Northern Europe has recently become a stage for special activities by American militarists. American naval vessels sail freely in Norwegian territorial waters as if they were in their own. Oslo and Copenhagen attract many British and American secret agents from the United States with various official or unofficial missions, as well as senior personnel related to the American military. Recent events have made it possible to understand the reasons for the increased activities of American militarists in the capitals of Northern European countries. The author is referring to the so-called "Northern European Liaison Group," a member of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, which was cobbled together by Norway and Denmark at the end of October under the auspices of the United States and with the participation of the United Kingdom. Its purpose is to turn the Northern European countries into a prominent flank of the Atlantic military alliance against the Soviet Union. Only a few days after this new Nordic military organization was established, the number of American soldiers pouring into London, Oslo, and Copenhagen greatly increased. Delegations from the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Defense also arrived in the capitals of the three countries almost simultaneously, and American officers, who were given a particularly grand reception by the Norwegian military authorities, immediately visited the Holden naval base in Norway, the Sula and Kiraer airports near Oslo, and other military bases.
　　The author pointed out that the American aggression plan and the new additional consequences it has caused have placed a heavy burden on the working people of the Marshall Plan countries. Little Denmark, which is included in the Atlantic military group, bears huge military expenditures. The economic situation in Marshallized Norway is also constantly deteriorating. Despite the disastrous impact of Denmark and Norway's participation in the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic military group on these countries' economies and the decline in the living standards of the working people, the reactionary governments of these countries are still stepping up war preparations. American imperialists are tightening their grip on Western and Northern European countries. The author finally emphasized that the arrival of American officials who will become permanent military staff in these countries completely cancels out the independence of these countries; these countries, due to the reactionary policies of their ruling groups, have fallen into the hands of American warmongers.

　　美帝在北欧的阴谋　红海军报著文揭露
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报近刊载塞米诺夫一文，揭露美国军国主义者在北欧的阴谋。作者写道：北欧的海军地区，最近变成了美国军国主义者进行特别活动的舞台。美国海军舰只自由自在地在挪威领海里行驶，就像在他们自己领海里一样。奥斯陆和哥本哈根吸引了很多从美国来的负有各种官方或非官方使命的英美秘密间谍，以及与美国军界有关的高级人员。最近的事件使人们得以了解美国军国主义分子在北欧国家首都活动增加的原因。作者所指的是侵略性北大西洋公约之一员的所谓“北欧访华团”，已在美国主持下与英国参与下由挪威和丹麦在十月底拼凑而成，其目的是把北欧国家变成针对苏联的大西洋军事联盟的一个突出的侧翼。这个新北欧军事机构则刚成立几天，流入伦敦、奥斯陆和哥本哈根的美国军人就大大增加了。美国国务院和美国国防部的代表团也几乎同时到达了该三国的首都，而且受到挪威军事当局特别盛大接待的美国军官，立即访问了挪威的荷尔登海军基地、奥斯陆附近的苏拉、基拉尔飞机场以及其他军事基地。
    作者指出，美国侵略计划及其所引起的新的肩负附加的后果，便是使马歇尔国家劳动人民的沉重的负担。列入大西洋军事集团的小小丹麦，便担负着浩大的军事开支。马歇尔化的挪威的经济情势也不断地恶化。尽管丹麦、挪威的参加马歇尔计划和大西洋军事集团对这些国家的经济产生了灾难性的影响，并使劳动人民生活标准下降，然而，这些国家的反动政府却仍然加强战争准备。美国帝国主义者正越来越紧地扼住西欧和北欧国家的老虎钳。作者最后着重指出，将成为这些国家永久的军事参谋的美国官员的到达，完全取消了这些国家的独立；这些国家由于其统治集团的反动政策，已投入美国战争贩子的掌握中。
