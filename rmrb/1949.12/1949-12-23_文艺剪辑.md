Literary Clippings

　　The Northeast Cultural Congress commenced on the 10th of this month at the Cultural Club in Shenyang. The twelve delegations participating, representing over six hundred and fifty people, will summarize the experiences of the Northeast's literary and artistic work over the past four years, determine future tasks, and establish the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles at this meeting.

　　On the second day of the conference, Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, reported on "Elevating Literature and Art to a New Level in the People's Construction Period." He mentioned that the past four years of literary and artistic creation in the Northeast had depicted heroic figures of the war and land reform, educating the people and cadres. Significant achievements had been made in both quantity and quality. However, the main shortcoming of this period was that the portrayal of the basic protagonist in the people's literature and art – the positive characters – was not profound enough. In terms of creative methods, there were also tendencies towards naturalism and formalism. Now, with the beginning of the Northeast's people's construction period, new themes have emerged, requiring us to thoroughly transform ourselves. We need to organize literary and artistic workers and use our strength in a planned way to depict the heroic undertakings and heroic figures of the people's construction, create more and better works to educate the broad masses of people, promote the people's construction, and closely integrate literature and art with the current political tasks.

　　On the day of the opening of the Literary Congress on the 10th, the Northeast Daily published a "Special Issue of the Northeast Literary Congress," which included Cai Tianxin's "Strengthening the Ideological Nature of Literature and Art and Opposing Naturalistic Tendencies." It expressed some differing opinions on Tian Lan's "Opposing the Tendency of Formalism in Slogans—Taking Literature and Art a Step Forward" published in "Literary Gazette." He pointed out: Comrade Tian Lan's original intention was to stand on the position of realism, oppose formalism, and take literature and art a step forward, but has it deviated to another aspect, negating the significance of political guidance in leadership? He believes that the tendency of formalism in literature and art is mainly due to writers' insufficient and narrow contact with life, making the works insufficiently visualized, thus the characters depicted are relatively conceptual, rather than because the author's subjective political thought rejects the creation of images. Judging from today's literary and artistic creation, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, continue to delve deeply into life, and improve our understanding of life, and carry out organized critical leadership work in literary and artistic creation, only then can we take literature and art a step forward. All attempts to weaken the understanding of political and ideological nature are incorrect.

　　文艺剪辑
    东北文化大会，已于本月十日在沈阳市文化俱乐部开幕。参加大会的十二个代表团，代表六百五十余人，在这个会上要总结东北四年来文艺工作的经验，确定今后的任务，并成立东北文联。
    在会议的第二日，东北局宣传部副部长刘芝明报告“将文艺提到人民建设时期的新水平”，他提到关于在东北过去四年的文艺创作中，表现了战争和土地改革的英雄人物，教育了人民和干部，无论在数量与质量上都有很大的成就，但这个时期主要的缺点是对于人民文艺中的基本主人翁，——正面的人物，表现得还不够深刻，在创作方法上也有自然主义与公式主义的偏向。现在由于东北人民建设时期的开端，崭新的题材出现，就需要我们彻底转变，就需要把文艺工作者组织起来有计划的使用力量，来表现人民建设的英雄事业与英雄人物，创造更多更好的作品，来教育广大的人民，推动人民建设，而使文艺也就密切结合了当前的政治任务。
    在十日文代大会开幕那天，东北日报曾出刊“东北文代大会特辑”，其中有蔡天心的“加强文艺的思想性反对自然主义倾向”，对天蓝在“文艺报”上所发表的“反对标语口号的形式主义的倾向——把文艺向前提高一步”有些不同的意见，他指出：天蓝同志原意是站在现实主义立场上，反对公式主义，把文艺提高一步，但是否又偏了另外一方面，否定了领导上的政治指导意义？他认为文艺的公式主义倾向，主要是由于作家生活接触不深不广，使作品形象化不够，因而描写出来的人物就比较概念，而不是因为作者主观上的政治思想排斥了形象的创造，从今天的文艺创作来看，我们必须加强马列主义与毛泽东思想学习，继续深入生活，并提高对生活的认识，有组织地进行文艺创作的批评领导工作，然后才能把文艺向上提高一步。一切企图减弱政治性与思想性的认识，都是不正确的。
