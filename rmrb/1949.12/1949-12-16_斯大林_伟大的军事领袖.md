　　Stalin - Great Military Leader
　　By Major General A. Shirbakov, special translation by this newspaper

　　The wise leader - Stalin, the teacher and close friend of the working people of the world, is the greatest military leader. Stalin's military genius demonstrates that he is a pivotal figure for the Soviet state and a figure of the greatest significance for the destiny of mankind.
　　Stalin, who is close to the people and infinitely loved by the people, possesses the characteristics of a brilliant political leader and the greatest thinker of millions of working people, as well as those of a shrewd strategist and an outstanding organizer of the masses.
　　Stalin, together with Lenin, established the great Bolshevik Party, and gathered the masses for the victorious Great October Socialist Revolution and the arduous struggle against the countless domestic and foreign enemies of the Soviet Republic, creating the world's first socialist state's army.
　　Stalin was Lenin's main support in building the Soviet army and organizing and leading the Soviet state's defense.
　　Lenin had a high appreciation of Stalin's organizational and military genius. Their voluminous correspondence proves their unwavering friendship and that Lenin, as the leader of the Soviet state, consulted with Stalin on all the most important issues of Soviet state policy, as well as on issues of military strategy and tactics. Lenin never decided any important political or military issue without consulting Stalin.
　　During the Civil War, the Party Central Committee and Lenin ordered Stalin to the most critical and dangerous fronts for the revolution. Wherever Stalin appeared, the Red Army was sure to win. Stalin was the creator of the most important strategic plans and the inspirer and organizer of all decisive victories of the Soviet army.
　　Stalin is the concrete embodiment of great fearlessness and unwavering will to overcome the enemy and of confidence in victory. He educated and commanded the political commissars, without whom, as Lenin pointed out, "there could be no Red Army."
　　Stalin was good at seeing through and fundamentally thwarting the enemy's most ingenious and insidious strategic plans, overthrowing all their military "science," their military "art," and skills.
　　During the Civil War, Stalin laid the foundation for the world's most advanced military science - Stalin's military science is a further development of military science.
　　After the Civil War, Stalin constantly paid attention to the unity and improvement of the Soviet armed forces. At the Second Soviet Congress, Stalin solemnly swore that he would spare no effort to strengthen the Red Army and the Red Navy for the Party. Although the Trotskyites and Bukharinites brazenly resisted and sold intelligence to the imperialists, Stalin's oath was ultimately fulfilled.
　　The anti-revolutionary bandits were exposed and eradicated from the Bolshevik Party, thanks to Stalin's great ingenuity and determination.
　　The Soviet armed forces gathered greater strength and improved their combat readiness on the basis of the wise Stalin's policies of Soviet state industrialization and agricultural collectivization.
　　Stalin was and is the designer and thinker who guided the combined use of tanks, airplanes, and artillery. He inspired and organized the construction of a vast navy. Thanks to Stalin's unwavering concern, the Soviet Socialist state was able to prepare for proactive defense in advance.
　　The war of resistance against Hitler's Germany was a great test of the strength and ability of the Soviet people. Under the direct and wise leadership of their glorious leader, the Soviet people and their valiant armed forces confidently overcame this severe test.
　　Stalin warned: In the history of many countries, in military history, there have been lessons: that is, there were clearly various possibilities for victory and success, but these possibilities were missed because the leaders did not pay attention to them, and they could not discover the opportunities that could be used, resulting in the army's disastrous defeat.
　　Stalin's great contribution to the motherland and to progressive humanity worldwide lies in the fact that he grasped all the opportunities that could be used and obtained the most effective methods to enhance the economic, cultural, and political interests of the Soviet social and state system.
　　Based on Stalin's strategic plans, and under his leadership, outstanding military leaders were selected, and thanks to his rewards and education, they completed brilliant operational tasks on the front lines of the Great Patriotic War.
　　Every battle, such as the battles of Moscow, Stalingrad, and Voronezh, Kharkov, Kiev, Leningrad, Minsk, and the battles of Iasi-Kishinev, as well as the offensive battles against the main central cities of Hitler's Germany in early 1945, clearly bear the vivid imprint of Stalin's military genius.
　　Thanks to the wisdom of the great Stalin, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, saved the independence and freedom of the motherland and liberated the people of Europe from fascist enslavement. The Soviet people wholeheartedly love Stalin, precisely because he led them to overcome difficulties and get through the war, and precisely because of his leadership, the motherland was saved and victory was achieved.
　　Stalin is the leader - the innovator of military science. He bravely smashed everything that was decadent and backward. Only the great Stalin could establish a solid scientific connection between the various arms of modern military departments in modern offensive and defensive warfare. He studied the issue of reserve forces, which is of great significance in war. Stalin skillfully and accurately determined the time and direction to inflict heavy blows on the enemy. He pointed out the method for a decisive shift in the balance of power in favor of the Soviet army, and he pointed out the method for surpassing the enemy in the course of the war.
　　Stalin elaborated on the factors that can determine the outcome of the war, on the laws of proactive defense and counter-offensive and offensive, on the mutual coordination of different military departments and military technologies in modern warfare, on the importance of collective formations of tanks and airplanes in modern warfare, and on the deployment of artillery power. In every stage of the war, Stalin's genius could find the correct answer, which fully took into account the characteristics of the situation.
　　During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people further loved their leader, teacher, fighter, and friend - Stalin. They loved his selfless contributions to the Soviet motherland and his unwavering concern for the progress and prosperity of socialist forces. Stalin's name, which is hoped for by all, is a symbol of the Soviet social morality and political unity.
　　During the Great Patriotic War, the contributions of Stalin, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces, received the highest praise from the Soviet state.
　　On March 6, 1943, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded Stalin the military rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union.
　　In June 1943, Stalin was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 1st Class.
　　Because of Stalin's brilliant contributions in organizing and commanding the Red Army's offensive, and precisely because of his command ability, the German invaders were defeated, and a decisive shift in favor of the Soviet army was obtained on the front line of the anti-German invasion, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, on July 29, 1944, specially awarded him the Order of Victory.
　　For his special contributions in organizing all the armed forces of the Soviet Union and in the wise leadership of the troops in the Great Patriotic War that defeated Hitler's Germany, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, representing the will of all the Soviet people, awarded Stalin the Order of Victory for the second time on June 26, 1945.
　　At the same time, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for leading the Red Army in defending the Soviet state and its capital Moscow in times of crisis, and for his exceptionally courageous and determined command of the struggle against Hitler.
　　On June 27, 1945, Stalin was awarded the highest military rank in the Soviet Union - Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union.
　　The Soviet armed forces, founded and cultivated by Stalin, are closely guarding the interests of the Soviet motherland and the labor achievements of the Soviet people's peaceful construction, and the Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Stalin, are successfully marching towards the road of building communism.
　　May the inspirer and organizer of all victories - the wise leader, teacher, and great soldier, Chairman Stalin, live long and be forever healthy, and be able to see the happiness and well-being of the working people of the world.

　　斯大林——伟大的军事领袖
    Ａ·希尔巴科夫少将作  本报特译
    英明的领导者——全世界劳动人民的导师和挚友斯大林是最伟大的军事领袖。斯大林的军事天才显示他对苏维埃国家是有举足轻重的重要人物，是对人类在命运具有最伟大意义的人物。
    人民所乐于亲近的，人民无限热爱的斯大林，具有千百万劳动人民的英明政治领袖和最伟大思想家的特色以及精明战略家和卓越的群众组织者的特色。
    斯大林与列宁共同建立了伟大的布尔塞维克党，为了胜利的伟大十月社会主义革命和与苏联共和国无数国内外敌人坚苦斗争中创立了世界上第一个社会主义国家的军队，他们集合了群众。
    斯大林是襄助列宁在建立苏军及组织与领导苏维埃国家的国防事业上的主要支柱。
    列宁对斯大林的组织和军事天才有着高度的赏识。从他们卷帙繁多的通信中，可以证明出他们之间的永矢不移的友谊，可以证明出做为苏维埃国家领袖之列宁无论在苏维埃国家政策的一切最重要的问题上以及在军事战略战术的问题上，都与斯大林共同磋商。列宁从不未经与斯大林商谈过而决定任何一个重要政治军事问题。
    内战时期，党中央委员会和列宁授命斯大林到对革命最关重要、最有危险性的前线去。无论在何地，只要斯大林出现，红军就一定能取得胜利。斯大林是最重战略计划的创作者，是苏军的一切决定性胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。
    斯大林是在胜利中战胜敌人与信心的伟大无畏和意志决不动摇的具体表现。他教育并指挥着政治委员，正如列宁所指出的，没有他，“就不能有红军”。
    斯大林善于识破并能根本挫败敌人最机巧最险毒的战略计划，他推翻了他们的全部军事“科学”他们的军事“艺术”和技巧。
    在内战期间，斯大林奠下了世界上最前进的军事科学的基础——斯大林的军事科学是军事科学进一步的发展。
    内战后，斯大林经常关注苏联武装力量的团结与改进。在第二届苏维埃大会上，斯大林庄严的宣誓，为了党不惜一切努力，去加强红军和红海军。虽有托洛斯基派和布哈林派的匪棍悍然对抗，以及他们把情报卖给了帝国主义者，可是斯大林的誓言终归实现了。
    反革命的匪棍们被揭发并根除于布尔塞维克党之外，这应感谢斯大林的伟大机智和决心。
    苏联的武装力量在英明的斯大林的苏维埃国家工业化和农业集体化的政策基础上，会集了更大的力量及提高了战斗准备。
    斯大林曾是而现在也是指导联合运用坦克、飞机和大炮的设计者和思想家。他鼓舞和组织建造庞大的海军。感谢斯大林的始终不渝的关切，苏维埃社会主义国家得以准备事先的主动防卫。
    抵抗希特勒德国的战争，是对苏维埃人民力量和才能的伟大考验。在辉煌的领袖直接而机智的领导下，苏维埃人民以及他们勇武的武装力量，满怀信心地渡过了这严重的考验。
    斯大林这样告诫着：在许多国家的历史上，军事历史上都曾有过这样的教训：就是明明存在着各种走向胜利获得成功的可能，但这些可能都错过了，因为领导的人没有注意到它们，他们不能发现可能利用的机会而使军队惨败。
    斯大林对祖国对全世界进步人类的伟大功绩，即在于他掌握了所有可能运用的机会，并且得到了最有效的方法以增强苏维埃社会与国家制度的经济、文化与政治的利益。
    基于斯大林的战略计划，和在他的领导下，优秀的军事领导干部被挑选出来了，并由于他的奖励与教育，他们完成了在伟大卫国战争前线上的光辉灿烂的作战任务。
    每一个战役如：莫斯科，斯大林格勒和乌洛涅兹，卡尔科夫，基辅、列宁格勒，明斯克诸战役，和亚斯，基什涅夫之战，以及包括一九四五年初对希特勒德国诸主要中心城市进攻之战役中，都显然地刻划着斯大林的军事天才的生动印迹。
    感谢伟大斯大林的睿智，苏维埃人民在布尔什维克党领导下，拯救了祖国的的独立和自由并从法西斯奴役下解放了欧洲人民。苏维埃人民全心全意地爱戴着斯大林，正是由于他——领导着他们战胜困难度过战争，正是由于他的领导，挽救了祖国并获得胜利。
    斯大林是领导者——军事科学的革新者。他勇敢地粉碎腐朽的和落后的一切。只有伟大的斯大林才能建立现代军事部门多样兵种在现代攻防战中的确实地科学联系。他精研了后备军的问题，这在战争上是有巨大意义的。斯大林以熟练的精确决定予敌人沉重打击的时间和方位。他指出力量对比中有利于苏军的决定性转变的方法，他指出在战争过程中完成超越敌人的方法。
    斯大林精研出关于能决定战争结果的永久作战的因素，关于主动防卫和反攻与进攻中的法则，关于在现代战争中不同的军事部门和军事技术的相互配合，关于现代战争中坦克和飞机集体编队的重要性，以及关于发挥大炮威力等论说。在战争的每个阶段里，斯大林的天才都能找出正确的解答，这解答就是能充分计及局势的特点。
    在伟大卫国战争期间，苏维埃人民进一步热爱着他们的领袖、导师、战斗员和友人——斯大林。热爱着对苏维埃祖国的忘我的贡献以及他对社会主义力量的进步和繁荣始终不渝地关切。众望所归的斯大林的名字是苏维埃社会道德和政治的一致的象征。
    在伟大卫国战争中，苏联武装力量最高统帅斯大林的贡献，得到了苏维埃国家的最高赞扬。
    一九四三年三月六日苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁予斯大林以苏联元帅的军级。
    一九四三年六月斯大林荣膺了一等苏渥洛夫勋章。
    因为斯大林在组织和指挥红军进攻上有光辉的贡献，正是由于他的指挥才能，才击败了德寇，才在抗德入侵的前线上获得有利于苏军的决定性转变，苏联最高苏维埃主席团，于一九四四年七月二十九日特授予他胜利勋章。
    为了在组织苏联全部武装力量上以及战胜希特勒德国的伟大卫国战争中的部队的贤能领导上的特殊贡献，苏联最高苏维埃主席团代表全苏人民的意志于一九四五年六月二十六日第二次授予斯大林胜利勋章。
    与此同时，由于他在危急中领导红军保卫苏维埃国家和它的首都莫斯科，以及他以异常的勇气和决心指挥了抵抗希特勒的斗争，他荣膺了苏联英雄的称号。
    在一九四五年六月二十七日，斯大林荣膺了苏联最高军级——苏联委员长。
    斯大林创立及教养起来的苏联武装力量，正在密切地警卫着苏维埃祖国的利益和苏维埃人民和平建设的劳动成果，苏维埃人民在伟大的斯大林领导下正成功地迈向建设共产主义的大道。
    愿一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——英明领袖、导师和伟大的兵士斯大林委员长万寿无疆，永远健康，能看到全世界劳动人民的快乐与幸福。
