　　Promoting Literacy Movement to Improve Culture
  　Lüda District Rewards Exemplary Individuals
  　240,000 Illiterate People Have Been Studying for Eight Months
    Over 700 Teachers and Trainees Receive Awards with Honor
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] Lüda News: On November 27th, Lüda solemnly held a district-wide literacy movement award ceremony for exemplary individuals. 741 exemplary teachers and exemplary students were honorably awarded, and 37 exemplary schools, exemplary classes, and exemplary groups were also awarded at the same time. After the CCP Lüda District Committee put forward the policy of "developing production, improving people's livelihoods; developing culture, cultivating cadres" at the beginning of this year, it then put forward the task of "promoting a mass cultural movement, adopting the mass line, carrying out the literacy movement, and striving to basically eliminate illiteracy in a short period of time." Subsequently, the Lüda Administrative Office formulated a plan for eliminating illiteracy from 1949 to 1950. Thanks to the joint efforts of all the people and cadres, out of the 283,427 illiterate and semi-literate people in the entire Lüda district, 240,0693 people have been regularly participating in studies since March of this year in eight local cultural centers, ninety-two cultural clubs, three hundred and twenty-two rural cultural stations, one thousand one hundred and seventy-six literacy schools, one thousand five hundred and thirty-six literacy classes, and one thousand five hundred and fifty literacy groups. There are a total of 7,782 teachers, of which 7,444 are mass teachers. Among them, the best students have learned more than 1,000 characters, and the average students also recognize 500 or 600 characters. Among the 43,900 students in Lüshun City, 10,924 people recognize 800 to 1,000 characters. In Lijia Village, Shuangdao District of the city, no one can be found who does not know how to read. Lu Zhengyi, Director of the Education Department of the Lüda Administrative Office, pointed out in his speech at the award ceremony for exemplary individuals: The achievements of the literacy movement in the past eight months are vividly reflected in these exemplary individuals. He said: "We must pay attention to the creations of the exemplary individuals and regard them as valuable experience to be widely promoted." Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the CCP Lüda District Committee, emphasized in his speech at the conference that cadres at all levels should earnestly continue to adopt the mass line to promote the literacy movement. He said: "From the work process of these months, it has been proven that whenever the literacy movement earnestly adopts the mass line, deeply mobilizes, and patiently persuades, the results will inevitably be great; on the contrary, whenever simple administrative orders are adopted, not only will the results be small, but it will even arouse resentment from the masses." In order to mobilize and organize all illiterate and semi-literate people aged fifteen to forty-five in the district to study in various learning organizations, and to effectively complete the task of basically eliminating illiteracy in the Lüda district in 1950, Ouyang Qin called on everyone to further develop learning, especially to seize the time for winter study this year. After Director Lu presented the various awards to the exemplary individuals one by one, the representatives of the exemplary individuals stood up and spoke one after another, expressing that they would work harder in their studies in the future, unite the masses, and ensure the completion of the literacy task.

  　旅大区奖励模范
  　廿四万文盲已学习八个月
    七百余教师学员光荣受奖
    【本报讯】旅大消息：十一月二十七日旅大隆重举行全区识字运动奖励模范大会，七百四十一名模范教师与模范学员光荣受奖，另有三十七个模范学校、模范班、模范小组也同时受奖。今年初，中共旅大区党委提出了“发展生产，改善民生；发展文化，培养干部”的方针以后，随又提出了“推行群众性的文化运动，采取群众路线，开展识字运动，力争在短期内，基本上消灭文盲”的任务。旅大行署继制定了一九四九——一九五○年消灭文盲的计划。由于全体人民和干部的共同努力，旅大全区二十八万三千四百二十七个文盲与半文盲中，现已有二十四万六千另九十三人从今年三月份起分别参加在八个地方文化馆，九十二个文化俱乐部，三百二十二个农村文化站，一千一百七十六个识字学校，一千五百三十六个识字班，一千五百五十个识字小组里经常学习。教师共达七千七百八十二名，其中群众教师占七千四百四十四名。其中成绩最好的已经学会一千多字，一般的也认得五、六百字，旅顺市四万三千九百多个学员中，认识八百到一千个字的已有一万零九百二十四人，该市双岛区李家沟已经找不到一个不识字的人。旅大行署教育厅长卢正义在奖励模范会上致词时指出：八个月来识字运动的成绩，具体生动地表现在这些模范身上。他说：“我们必须重视模范们的创造，并把它看成宝贵的经验，广泛的推广。”中共旅大区党委书记欧阳钦在大会上讲话时，强调各级干部应认真继续采取群众路线推进识字运动。他说：“从这几个月的工作过程中，证明了一点，就是凡对识字运动，认真采取群众路线，深入动员，耐心说服的态度，成效就必然大；相反，凡采取简单行政命令的办法，不但收效小，甚至引起了群众的反感。”为了把全区十五岁至四十五岁的文盲与半文盲全部动员组织到各种学习组织里面学习，切实完成旅大区在一九五○年基本上消灭文盲的任务，欧阳钦号召大家进一步开展学习，特别抓紧今年冬学时间。在卢厅长将各项奖品一一授予各模范后，模范代表均先后立起讲话，表示今后更加努力学习，团结群众，保证完成识字任务。
