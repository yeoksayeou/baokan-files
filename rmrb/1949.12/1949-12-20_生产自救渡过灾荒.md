　　Production and Self-Salvation to Overcome Famine
    The State Council of the Central People's Government today issued instructions on production for disaster relief. These instructions explain the severity of the disasters in various regions, the achievements of this year's production relief work, the enormous difficulties that still exist, and also point out the direction and methods for solving this problem in the future. As with the overall economic situation, we have difficulties, solutions, and hope in this matter. The instructions of the State Council have increased our infinite confidence in overcoming difficulties and defeating disasters.
    As the State Council's instructions state, the disaster situation is still very serious. There are currently seven to eight million people in China who have nothing to eat or lack food. If we do not promptly and vigorously carry out production and disaster relief work, the situation will become even more serious when the spring famine arrives next year. This is an extremely important issue placed before governments at all levels. Because this matter concerns the lives of millions of people, concerns production in 1950, and also concerns the future construction of New China. It is very clear that in severely disaster-stricken areas, if we do not first overcome the disaster and save the victims, all other work is impossible to start. And in non-disaster areas, if we do not work together with one heart and help our disaster-stricken compatriots overcome the disaster, we will inevitably be affected by the disaster. Therefore, "governments and people's organizations at all levels in disaster areas must take production and disaster relief as the center of their work," and "non-disaster areas should also practice thrift, promote the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, and help disaster areas."
    To launch a led, organized, and mass-based production and disaster relief movement to overcome severe famine, it is necessary to overcome two ideological obstacles on the road ahead. In some Party and government leading organs and leaders, there is a mentality of insufficient awareness of the severity of the disaster, paralysis and relaxation, and muddling through, always thinking that things will naturally get better, and therefore lacking serious concern for the life and death of the masses; or, in the face of the disaster, they are panicked, pessimistic, and despairing, believing that there is no way out except for the higher-level government to allocate funds and grain for relief, and therefore they only report the disaster and ask for help, without carrying out any serious production and disaster relief work themselves. We must resolutely oppose and overcome these two erroneous tendencies, so that governments and leaders at all levels will pay attention to production and disaster relief work and earnestly take responsibility. And as long as they are conscientious and responsible, go deep into the disaster areas, take action themselves, help the masses, and create many effective methods of production for self-help and frugality together with the masses, they can overcome any serious famine. Among the disaster-stricken masses, there is a fatalistic concept and a mentality of waiting for relief, believing that fate determines everything and cannot be changed, and that there is nothing they can do except for government relief or fleeing the famine, so they are passively watching, not engaging in production, and not making long-term plans. Only by patiently persuading the masses, educating them with the experience of many places in the past in surviving famine through production, explaining that man can conquer nature, and that their own difficulties must mainly be solved by themselves, can they be fully mobilized and organized, save money and use it sparingly, produce for self-help, and actively strive for survival, coupled with the leadership and help of the government (such as allocating grain, loans, and supporting disaster victims' production), and the mutual assistance and relief between disaster and non-disaster areas, can the disaster be effectively overcome.
    Based on the experience of multiple disaster relief efforts in North China and Northeast China since the Anti-Japanese War, the most central and effective way to overcome disasters is production, that is, mobilizing the vast number of disaster-stricken compatriots to take action themselves and produce for self-help. Because although government relief and donations from the masses in non-disaster areas can play a great role, the government's financial resources are limited, and the help from compatriots in non-disaster areas cannot be endless, and often distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. As the saying goes, "Sitting and eating empties the mountain." Even if the government's allocation of grain and funds, and the donations from compatriots in non-disaster areas, are large, if the disaster-stricken compatriots do not make good use of these relief and assistance, and actively engage in production, but only eat as much as is given, there will still be great difficulties when the spring famine comes next year. Therefore, this State Council instruction focuses on promoting production for self-help, provides many specific methods in this regard, and clearly instructs that the relief grain and funds allocated and loaned by the government should also be used to organize production. This is undoubtedly very correct. As long as we establish the concept of production for self-help, correctly use these methods, and everyone thinks of ideas and takes action, creating more good experiences and methods based on local conditions, we are fully hopeful of overcoming the famine this winter and next spring.

### 生产自救渡过灾荒

　　生产自救渡过灾荒
    中央人民政府政务院今日颁发了生产救灾指示。这个指示，说明了各地区灾害的严重情况，今年生产救灾工作的成绩，目前依然存在着的巨大困难，也指出了今后解决这个问题的方针和办法。和整个经济情况同样，在这个问题上，我们也是有困难，有办法，有希望的。政务院的指示，使我们对于克服困难、战胜灾害增加了无限的信心。
    正如政务院的指示所说，目前灾情依然十分严重。全中国现在已有七、八百万人没有吃的或缺少吃的，如果我们不及时以大力进行生产救灾工作，那么明年春荒到来，情势会更加严重。这是放在各级人民政府面前的一个极端重大的问题。因为这件事关系千百万人的生命，关系一九五○年的生产，也关系新中国今后的建设工作。很显然的，在被灾严重的地区，如果不首先把灾害克服，灾民救活，其他一切工作都是无从着手的。而在非灾区，如果不协力同心，帮助灾区受灾同胞战胜灾害，那么也必然会受到灾害的影响。因此，“灾区的各级人民政府及人民团体要把生产救灾作为工作的中心”，“非灾区也应进行节约，发扬友爱互助的精神，帮助灾区。”
    要开展有领导的有组织的而又是群众性的生产救灾运动，战胜严重的灾荒，必须克服两重横在前进道路上的思想障碍。在某些党政领导机关和领导人员中，存在着一种对灾情的严重性认识不足，麻痹松懈，得过且过的心理，总认为事情自然而然会好起来的，因而对于群众的死活缺少严重关心；或者在灾情面前惊惶失措，悲观失望，认为除了上级政府拨款拨粮救济以外，其他再无出路，因而只是一股劲向上报灾求救，而自己却不进行任何认真的生产救灾工作。必须坚决地反对和克服这两种错误倾向，各级人民政府和领导人员，才会重视生产救灾工作，认真负起责任来。而只要他们认真负责，深入灾区，亲自动手，帮助群众，和群众一起创造出许多生产自救，节约渡荒有效的办法，便可渡过任何严重的灾荒。在被灾的群众中，则存在着一种听天由命观念和坐待救济的心理，认为命运决定一切，变也变不过来，除了政府救济或向外逃荒而外，自己就无法可想，因而他们消极观望，不事生产，不作长期打算。只有耐心地说服群众，用以往各地许多生产渡荒的经验教育他们，说明人定可以胜天，自己的困难主要要依靠自己解决，把他们充分地动员和组织起来，省吃俭用，生产自救，积极地为生存而奋斗，加上政府的领导和帮助（如拨粮、贷款、扶植灾民生产等），以及灾区和非灾区人民的互助互济，才能有效地战胜灾荒。
    根据抗日战争以来，华北、东北地区多次救灾工作的经验，克服灾害的最中心和最有效的办法是生产，即动员广大被灾同胞自己动手，生产自救。因为政府的救济和非灾区群众的捐输，虽然可起很大作用，但政府的财力是有限的，非灾区的同胞的帮助也不可能没有止境，而且往往远水不救近火。俗语说：“坐吃山空。”即使政府的拨粮拨款，和非灾区同胞的捐输数量很大，如果灾民同胞不好好地利用这些救济和帮助，积极从事生产，而只是救济多少吃多少，到了明年春荒时节，依然会发生很大困难。所以，这次政务院的指示，着重提倡生产自救，在这一方面提供了许多具体办法，并且明确指示政府拨贷的救济粮款，也要用来组织生产。这无疑地是十分正确的。只要我们确立生产自救的观念，正确地运用这些办法，而且人人想法，个个动手，根据当地情形，创造出更多好的经验和办法，我们就完全有希望渡过今冬明春的灾荒。
