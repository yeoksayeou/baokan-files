Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st. Soviet Embassy Chargé d'Affaires to the People's Republic of China, Shtykov's speech at the General Assembly of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin, excerpt:

　　Respected Comrades! Friends!

　　Today, the Soviet people celebrate with joy the 70th birthday of our outstanding and talented leader, dear friend and mentor, the great Stalin. All peace-loving people around the world share this great joy with the Soviet people. The great friends of the Soviet people - the four hundred and seventy-five million free Chinese people - also share this great joy, and their representatives are attending this celebration in the Soviet Union.

　　This great friend of the working people - Stalin - dedicated his life to the struggle for the happiness of mankind. From the age of fifteen, he plunged into the revolutionary struggle, and dedicated fifty-five years of his glorious life to this struggle. Together with Lenin, he created the Bolshevik Party, organized the Russian working class, and prepared and ensured the victory of the proletarian revolution. Together with Lenin, he created the world's first Soviet state, and ensured the victory of the young Soviet Republic during the Civil War and the armed intervention of fourteen imperialist countries.

　　During the Great Patriotic War, Stalin most clearly demonstrated his genius in strategizing and commanding.

　　Following the plans formulated by Comrade Stalin and under his direct command, the Soviet army achieved lightning-fast victories all the way to Berlin, directly attacking the lair of the fascist beast and liberating the people of Europe from Hitler's tyranny.

　　Following the plans formulated by Comrade Stalin and under his wise command, the Soviet army, in just a few days in Northeast China, crushed the 500,000-strong so-called elite Japanese Kwantung Army and helped the people of Asia remove the shackles of the Japanese occupiers from themselves.

　　Under Stalin's command and guidance, the Soviet Union transformed from a backward agricultural country into a first-class socialist power with industry and collective farms.

　　Stalin is the glory of Soviet science, a scholar of immense power, and one of the greatest representatives of the most advanced science concerning the progress of human society.

　　He developed and supplemented Marxism-Leninism with the most exquisite academic works.

　　As early as 1927, Comrade Stalin foresaw the large-scale unfolding of the great revolutionary movements in the West and the East. At that time, when many people thought that the forces of the Chinese revolution had been defeated, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the third stage of the Chinese revolution must arrive. The great victory of the Chinese revolution under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong proved Comrade Stalin's genius and vision.

　　He cultivated noble internationalist sentiments among the Soviet people, which guide the Soviet people in their relations with the working people all over the world. The Soviet people have always held a cordial friendship towards the Chinese people, a noble friendship that Lenin and Stalin cultivated among us.

　　The strong fortress of Sino-Soviet friendship has grown and continues to grow on the basis of revolution. The imperialists and their Kuomintang reactionary running dogs have spent much effort and exhausted many methods to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. But their tricks have failed shamefully. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has been consolidated on a solid revolutionary foundation. This friendship between our two great countries is manifested in the brotherly friendship between the great leaders of our two peoples, Stalin and Mao Zedong!

　　Long live the great Chinese people!

　　Long live Mao Zedong, the esteemed leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

　　Long live Comrade Stalin, the great genius of mankind, the great revolutionary mentor, the leader of the working people, and the friend of all freedom-loving people in the world!

　　斯大林毛泽东的友谊表现两国人民的亲切
    苏大使馆代办史白夫演说
    【新华社北京二十一日电】苏联驻中华人民共和国大使馆代办史白夫在中苏友好协会总会庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰大会上讲词，略称：敬爱的同志们！朋友们！
    今天苏联人民满心欢喜地来庆祝我们卓越的天才的领袖、亲爱的朋友和导师、伟大的斯大林七十寿辰。全世界爱好和平的人民和苏联人民都共同享受这种巨大的快乐。苏联人民的伟大的朋友——四万七千五百万自由的中国人民也都分享这种巨大的快乐，他们的代表人正在出席这次在苏联的庆寿大会。
    这位劳动人民伟大的朋友——斯大林把他自己的一生贡献给追求人类幸福的斗争。从十五岁起，他就投身于革命的斗争，并且把自己五十五年光荣的生活献给了这种斗争。他和列宁一同创造了布尔什维克党，组织俄国工人阶级，准备而且保证了无产阶级革命的胜利。他和列宁一起创造了世界上第一个苏维埃国家，并且在内战和十四个帝国主义国家武装干涉时期确保了青年苏维埃共和国的胜利。
    在伟大的爱国战争年代里，斯大林最显明地表现了运筹帷幄的天才。
    遵照斯大林同志所制订的计划并且在他直接指挥之下，苏联军队迅雷疾雨一般胜利地达到柏林，直捣法西斯野兽的巢穴，把欧洲人民从希特勒暴政之下解放出来。
    苏联军队遵照斯大林同志制订的计划，并且在他英明的指挥之下，不到几天，就在中国东北粉碎了五十万所谓精锐的日本关东军，并且帮助亚洲人民从他们自己身上卸除了日本占领者的枷锁。
    在斯大林指挥和指示之下，苏联从落后的农业国家变成了工业的和集体农庄的第一等社会主义强国。
    斯大林乃是苏联科学的光荣，乃是力量雄伟的学者，乃是关于人类社会进展最前进的科学方面最伟大的代表人之一。
    他发扬并且用最精妙的学术作品，补充了马克思列宁主义。
    远在一九二七年，斯大林同志就预料到西方和东方巨大革命运动大规模的展开。在那时候，有很多人以为中国革命的力量是已经被击败了，斯大林同志就曾经指示说：中国革命的第三个阶段一定要到来。在英明的毛泽东主席指导之下，中国革命的大获全胜，证明了斯大林同志的天才的卓见。
    他在苏联人民之间培植起来了高贵的国际主义的情感，这种情感在我们和全世界劳动人民之间的相互关系上，指导着苏联人民。苏联人民在过去和现在，对于中国人民一贯怀着亲切的友情，这种崇高的友情，是列宁和斯大林在我们之间培植起来的。
    中苏友好的强大堡垒在革命的基础上增长了，而且继续增长着。帝国主义和他们的国民党反动派走狗，耗费了许多力量，并且用尽了许多方法，为的是破坏中苏人民的友好。但是他们的诡计很可耻地失败了。中苏人民之间的友好在坚固的革命基础上巩固起来了。我们两大国之间这种友好，由我们两国人民的伟大领袖斯大林和毛泽东之间兄弟一般的友谊表现出来了！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    崇高的中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    中苏两国人民友好万岁！
    人类伟大的天才，伟大的革命导师，劳动人民的领袖，全世界爱好自由的人民的朋友，斯大林同志万寿无疆！
