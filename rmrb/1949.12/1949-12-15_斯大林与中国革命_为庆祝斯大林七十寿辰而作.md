　　Stalin and the Chinese Revolution
    —Written to Celebrate Stalin’s Seventieth Birthday

    Comrade Mao Zedong said at the rally in Yan'an to celebrate Stalin's sixtieth birthday: "Stalin is the leader of the world revolution. This is a very important matter. The appearance of this Stalin among all mankind is a major event. With him, things are easier to handle. You know, Marx is dead, Engels is dead, Lenin is also dead, if there were no Stalin, who would issue orders? This is truly fortunate. Now there is a Soviet Union, a Communist Party, and a Stalin in the world, and things in this world are easier to handle." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to our Chinese Party comrades: "We must celebrate him, support him, and also learn from him. We must learn from him in two aspects, one is the aspect of truth, and the other is the aspect of his cause."
    Comrade Mao Zedong explained Stalin's contribution to developing Marxism-Leninism, explained that Stalin's guidance in completing the cause of socialist construction in the Soviet Union was a "world-shaking event," and explained Stalin's assistance to the cause of the Chinese people in terms of both truth and material support. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In the past, Marxism-Leninism theoretically guided the world revolution, but now something has been added, which can materially help the world revolution, and this is Stalin's great contribution."
    Ten years have passed, and now we are celebrating Comrade Stalin's seventieth birthday. This time is right after mankind has gone through the Second World War, and the people of all countries, led by the Soviet Union, have defeated the three fascist empires of Germany, Italy, and Japan; it is after many new people's democratic countries have emerged in the world; it is after the Chinese people have defeated Japanese imperialism, and then carried out the overthrow of the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary rule, expelled the aggressive forces of American imperialism, and thus were able to establish the People's Republic of China; it is when the Soviet Union is incomparably strong in the world, while the world imperialist system headed by American imperialism is crumbling. This series of great historical events in the past ten years are inseparable from Stalin's name, inseparable from Stalin's cause, and inseparable from Stalin's assistance to the people of all countries. The world historical events of the past ten years have further shown that Stalin is not only the banner of the victory of the Soviet people, but also the banner of the victory of all progressive mankind in the world. At the same time, it has further shown what Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out ten years ago: "Stalin is the leader of the world revolution. This is a very important matter. The appearance of this Stalin among all mankind is a major event. With him, things are easier to handle." It is "truly fortunate" that there is this Stalin in the world!
    Stalin's birthday is the world's "Renri" (Human Day). The fact that the Chinese people can celebrate the seventieth birthday of this world's greatest figure and genius mentor, who has the most universal connections and the broadest achievements in the cause of human liberation since Marx, Engels, and Lenin, together with the Soviet people and all progressive mankind in the world, is itself a piece of good fortune for the Chinese people. This celebration itself is a celebration of human liberation, a celebration of human hope and the future.
    But our Chinese celebration of Stalin also has its special aspects, that is: the close relationship between Stalin and the Chinese revolution, Stalin's concern for the destiny of the Chinese people, and his great theoretical contributions to the Chinese revolution.
    II
    Based on a concrete analysis of the specific conditions of Chinese society, Stalin, the great scientific master of materialist dialectics, the world's revolutionary mentor, raised a series of questions about the Chinese revolution during the First Great Revolution in China, and made extremely brilliant arguments about them, crushed the counter-revolutionary Trotskyite's nonsense about the Chinese question, and helped the Chinese Party embark on the Bolshevik path. Stalin's many works on the Chinese question during this period are models of the combination of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice, a major part of the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist theory concerning the fate of mankind. Those many works were not only completely correct at the time, but have also proved to be completely correct in the practice of the Chinese revolution over the past twenty-odd years.
    When the Chinese people first showed their revolutionary vigor, Stalin had already seen that the Chinese revolution possessed unlimited power. In his report commemorating the October Revolution, Malenkov specially quoted a prediction Stalin made in 1925:
    "The power of the Chinese revolutionary movement is incalculable. This power has not yet been able to make itself properly felt. But they will certainly make themselves felt in the future. The rulers of the East and the West who do not see this power and do not give them due consideration will suffer greatly because of it."
    Stalin's prediction was based on calculating the political and economic conditions of China and the comparison of various forces within Chinese society, and also on calculating the world political and economic conditions and the comparison of various forces in the world.
    Regarding China, Stalin made such an important estimate when discussing the future of the Chinese revolution in November 1926: "The role of the leaders and guides of the Chinese revolution, the role of the leaders of the Chinese peasants, will inevitably fall into the hands of the Chinese proletariat and its party." Stalin's estimate was linked to the weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie. This is a very important estimate. Because if this is the case, if only the Chinese proletariat can become the leader of the Chinese revolution, then the Chinese peasants and all other people's masses will be able to exert their revolutionary power to the fullest under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, and once the people's masses of this country, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, can do this, it will inevitably change the face of the world.
    Regarding the world, obviously, Stalin started from Lenin's famous law of the uneven political and economic development of capitalist countries in the age of imperialism and the particularly acute intensification of its contradictions, and therefore estimated that the Chinese revolution might follow the Russian October Socialist Revolution and continue to break through the imperialist front in the East. Stalin also started from the fact of the existence and strength of the Soviet Union. This is what Stalin pointed out in "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution": "Alongside China, there is also the existence and development of the Soviet Union, whose revolutionary experience and assistance cannot but facilitate the Chinese proletariat's struggle against imperialism and against the medieval feudal remnants in China."
    Because Stalin's predictions came from a solid scientific foundation, and he saw the extraordinarily profound nature of the Chinese people's struggle, no matter when, no matter how significant setbacks the Chinese revolution encountered, he believed that the Chinese revolution would eventually move forward and achieve victory. When Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, Stalin immediately refuted the Trotskyites' nonsense that confused the Turkish "Kemal-style revolution" with the Chinese revolution. Stalin analyzed the differences between China and Turkey, and believed that there was no possibility of a Turkish "Kemal-style revolution" in China. Stalin said:
    "...In China, imperialism cannot but cut a knife from the living flesh of the Chinese nation, tearing it into many pieces, seizing its entire provinces, in order to maintain their old positions, or at least maintain a part of these positions. Therefore, if in Turkey, the anti-imperialist struggle can end with the Kemalists' truncated anti-imperialist revolution, then in China, the anti-imperialist struggle must take on a profound popular and distinct national character, and must deepen step by step, until it engages in a desperate duel with imperialism, shaking the very foundation of imperialism in the world." (Stalin: "Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University") Stalin also pointed out:
    "In China, either Chinese Mussolinis such as Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Zongchang will win, and later be overthrown by the tide of the land revolution; or Wuhan (referring to the then revolutionary Wuhan – Boda's note) will win. Chiang Kai-shek and his gang are trying to find a middle ground between these two camps, and they will inevitably fall, suffering the same fate as Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Zongchang." (Stalin: "Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University")
    When Wang Jingwei continued Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution, Stalin continued to refute the Trotskyites' nonsense about the bankruptcy of the Chinese revolution, and determined that there was no possibility of reformism in China. Stalin said:
    "The mutual infighting between the old and new warlords has erupted again. This war cannot but weaken the forces of counter-revolution, and at the same time, it cannot but bankrupt the peasants, causing them to complain against heaven and earth;"
    "There is no such group or government in China that can implement reforms similar to those of Kittelbing, which can be used as a lightning rod and a life-extending elixir for the ruling group;"
    "It is not easy to suppress the millions of peasants who are eager to seize the land of the landlords and make them lose heart about the land;"
    "The prestige of the proletariat among the working masses is increasing day by day, and their strength has never been annihilated." (Stalin: "Brief Comments on Current Affairs: On China")
    The occurrence of facts is the touchstone of prediction.
    Since 1927, a series of events have occurred in China: Chiang Kai-shek became the Chinese Mussolini and replaced Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Zongchang, the continuous infighting between the new and old warlords of the Kuomintang, the tide of the Chinese land revolution, the bankruptcy of any "reformist" attempts by the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary rule, Japanese imperialism—followed by American imperialism—cutting a knife into the flesh of China, the Chinese people engaged in a desperate duel with Japanese imperialism and American imperialism, and this struggle shook the foundations of imperialism in the world, Chiang Kai-shek followed the same fate as Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Zongchang and fell from the counter-revolutionary political stage... This series of events fully confirmed Stalin's predictions of more than twenty years ago.
    Stalin's predictions have inspired the Chinese people's struggle over the past twenty-odd years, showing that revolutionary science is an irresistible force, and at the same time exposing the ugly faces of the Trotskyites and all counter-revolutionary clowns who shamelessly touted Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's counter-revolution.
    III
    In May 1927, Stalin made this generalization on the nature of the Chinese revolution: "Today's Chinese revolution is the confluence of two revolutionary movements—the revolutionary movement against feudal remnants and the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement. The Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution is the confluence of the struggle against feudal remnants and the anti-imperialist struggle." (Stalin: "The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Communist International") This is a conclusion Stalin reached through a brilliant analysis of Chinese society. This is a conclusion of great historical significance for the Chinese revolution. Stalin pointed out: This was the "starting point for the entire line of the Communist International on the Chinese revolution." At that time, the Trotskyites opposed this line. The Trotskyites believed that China's foreign issues were only customs issues, thus negating the anti-imperialist nature of the Chinese revolution; the Trotskyites denied the dominant role of Chinese feudal remnants, thus negating the anti-feudal nature of the Chinese revolution. Stalin pointed out: The views held by Trotsky and his followers were the views of the counter-revolutionaries Zhang Zuolin and Chiang Kai-shek. Everyone knows: The Chinese Trotskyites, based on Trotsky's entire counter-revolutionary views, and also based on their counter-revolutionary views on the Chinese question, embarked on the counter-revolutionary road together with the Trotskyites of various countries.
    Stalin said: "The Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution is not only against feudal remnants, but also against imperialism." (Stalin: "The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Communist International") Only by determining such a revolutionary nature based on the situation of Chinese society can our Party correctly estimate the specific changes in class relations in each specific historical occasion, so as to formulate specific revolutionary tasks, organize the revolutionary front, and guide the revolution forward, and create the possibility for the Chinese revolution to grow into a socialist revolution under the leadership of the Chinese working class. Chen Duxiu's opportunism in 1927 opposed Stalin's dialectical analysis. It is well known that Chen Duxiuism later merged with counter-revolutionary Trotskyism, and I am not prepared to say more about it here. What needs to be pointed out here is: Since 1927, over the past twenty-odd years, the "left" or right opportunist errors that have occurred within our Party have usually first violated Stalin's dialectical analysis on the issue of the nature of the revolution, or neglected the anti-imperialist aspect, or neglected the anti-feudal aspect. For example, during the ten-year civil war, comrades who made "left"-leaning opportunist errors neglected the anti-imperialist aspect for a long time, and neglected Stalin's point that "the bourgeois democratic nature of the Chinese revolution is anti-imperialist" ("The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Communist International"); therefore, they were not good at using the situation to correctly organize the anti-imperialist front to cooperate with the struggle of the land revolution and break their isolation. During this period, they also prematurely advocated the adventure of implementing the "socialist revolutionary transformation." For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, comrades who had originally made "left"-leaning opportunist errors turned to making right-leaning opportunist errors. Their opinions were just like Chen Duxiuism in 1927, neglecting the anti-feudal aspect, "only seeing the bourgeoisie," "not seeing the decisive significance of the Chinese land revolutionary movement," and "not advocating opening up the revolution in the countryside, fearing that the peasant revolution would destroy the anti-imperialist united front." Of course, this kind of erroneous opinion directly opposed Stalin, because according to Stalin's opinion, it was like this: "The faster and more thoroughly the Chinese peasants are involved in the revolution, the stronger and more powerful the Chinese anti-imperialist united front will be." ("On the Future of the Chinese Revolution") These kinds of right-leaning opportunists, since they denied the anti-feudal aspect during this period, were also like Chen Duxiuism in 1927, advocating abandoning the leadership of the proletariat, only seeing the future of the bourgeoisie, and not seeing the future of the victory of the people's revolution and the future of socialism.
    Obviously, the question of the nature of the Chinese revolution is related to the specific tactical issues of each stage of the Chinese revolution. If he makes a mistake on the issue of the nature of the revolution, then he cannot but make mistakes on the specific issues of revolutionary tactics.
    When Stalin refuted the Trotskyites' nonsense about the Chinese question, he specifically explained several major tactical principles of Leninism:
    "First, when formulating the Communist International's leadership instructions for the workers' movement in each country, it is necessary to take into account the national characteristics and national peculiarities of these countries; second, the Communist Parties of various countries must use the smallest possibility to ensure that the proletariat must have mass allies, even if this mass ally is temporary, wavering, unsteady, and unreliable; third, it is necessary to consider the principle of the truth that for the political education of millions of masses, propaganda and agitation alone are not enough, and for this purpose, the masses themselves need political experience." (Stalin: "Brief Comments on Current Affairs: On China")
    Stalin then emphasized the issue of the combination of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism and national characteristics. Stalin wrote:
    "Although our Party has grown ideologically, unfortunately, there are still some kinds of "leaders" in our Party who sincerely believe that they can lead the Chinese revolution based on telegrams and some generally accepted general principles of the Communist International, without taking into account China's economy, Chinese political system, Chinese culture, Chinese morality, and Chinese traditional national characteristics. The difference between these "leaders" and true leaders is that at any time, they always have two or three ready-made formulas in their arms that are "necessary" for all countries and any conditions. The issue of taking into account the national characteristics and national peculiarities of each country does not exist for them. The issue of linking the general principles of the Communist International with the national characteristics of the revolutionary movement in each country, the issue of applying the general principles of the Communist International to the national characteristics of individual countries, does not exist for them. They do not understand that now that the Communist Parties of various countries have grown into mass parties, the main task of leadership lies in discovering, grasping, and being good at combining the unique national characteristics of the revolutionary movement in each country with the general principles of the Communist International, so as to promote and practically enable the basic goals of the communist movement to be realized. Therefore, they attempt to make the leadership of all countries uniform. Therefore, they attempt to mechanically apply some general formulas without taking into account the specific conditions of the revolutionary movement in individual countries. Therefore, a permanent conflict arises between the formulas and the revolutionary movement in individual countries, and these conflicts are the basic result of the leadership of these unfortunate leaders." (Ibid.)
    Stalin specifically used the question of the nature of the Chinese revolution to explain the question of Chinese revolutionary tactics, and thereby refuted the Trotskyites' nonsense on the question of the nature of the Chinese revolution and also on the question of Chinese revolutionary tactics. Stalin linked the question of the nature of the Chinese revolution with the question of Chinese revolutionary tactics, and pointed out and summarized the national characteristics of the Chinese revolution.
    The ideas expounded by Stalin here, in Comrade Mao Zedong's usual language, are: the idea of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Since 1927, the dogmatists in our Party, those who have made "left" or right opportunist errors, their errors have also been precisely because they have forgotten Stalin's refutation of the Trotskyites, and believed that to lead the Chinese revolution, they only need to have two or three ready-made formulas in their arms that are "applicable" to all countries and "necessary" under any conditions. The issue of considering Chinese national characteristics and national peculiarities does not exist for them. Therefore, a permanent conflict arises between their mechanical application of some formulas and the specific revolution in China.
    Our dogmatists limit themselves to abstract formulas and simple historical analogies, and do not start from the specific conditions of China, so they inevitably make this mistake on the question of the nature of the Chinese revolution, or make that mistake at that time; and therefore, they cannot combine principle with flexibility according to the changes in specific conditions, and cannot, as Stalin said, in order to defeat a powerful enemy, "need the flexibility and prudence of the proletariat, need to be good at using every gap in the enemy's camp, and be good at finding allies for themselves" ("Brief Comments on Current Affairs: On China"). Our dogmatists advocated overthrowing everything during the ten-year civil war, or as Comrade Mao Zedong ridiculed them: "If those in power cannot be overthrown, then those out of power must be overthrown. People are already out of power, and you still want to overthrow them." But in another historical occasion, such as in the occasion of the Anti-Japanese War, they turned to advocating all-out unity, denying that there are left, middle, and right factions in the anti-Japanese united front, and denying the necessary distinctions in our Party's policies towards these three factions. Therefore, they would not seriously contact the masses according to specific conditions, but instead implemented a series of commandism towards the masses. Stalin said: "It is necessary to make the masses themselves, based on their personal experience, recognize the unreliability, reactionary nature, and counter-revolutionary nature of the Kuomintang leadership." But our dogmatists forgot Stalin's lesson, thinking that as long as a few "leaders" recognize it, they can issue orders to make the masses follow. Stalin said: "The revolution is not only done by the vanguard, not only done by individual, even "great" "figures," but first and foremost, and mainly, done by the masses of millions of people." But our dogmatists forgot Stalin's lesson, thinking that the revolution was first and foremost, and mainly, "done" by a few self-righteous "leading figures."
    The Chinese events of the past thirty years have shown the extreme complexity and extreme tortuousness of the Chinese revolution, and this extreme complexity and extreme tortuousness are particularly caused by the complex and tortuous intertwining of the anti-imperialist struggle and the anti-feudal struggle. This has also led to a series of revolutionary tactical issues, the issue of the united front, the issue of the relationship between the revolution in urban and rural areas, and also the issue of the important strategy of military struggle. As Stalin said: "In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." So, where should the focus of attack in this armed struggle be placed at what time? Is there still defense or retreat in the attack? How are attack and defense or retreat combined? How does defense or retreat turn into attack? Everyone knows that this series of questions is an important part of Comrade Mao Zedong's long-term struggle against opportunism (sometimes adventurism, sometimes escapism), and whoever opposes Comrade Mao Zedong is precisely opposing Stalin.
    In 1927, after Chiang Kai-shek launched a betrayal in Shanghai, the strategic issue of the revolutionary war arose, and the Trotskyites at that time advocated an adventurous attack on Shanghai. Stalin opposed this adventure. At that time, Stalin said: "Shanghai is the world center where the important interests of various imperialist groups intersect." Stalin advocated to "fully prepare militarily, develop the land revolution as much as possible, and carry out intense work to destroy Chiang Kai-shek's front and rear, and then raise the entire issue of Shanghai." (Stalin: "Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University") Because "under unfavorable conditions, not avoiding (when it can be avoided) a decisive battle is tantamount to helping the enemy of the revolution." (Stalin: "The Question of the Chinese Revolution") But during the ten-year civil war, our "left"-leaning opportunists advocated simple, blind, and adventurous attacks on large cities under conditions of disparity in strength, and advocated fighting a decisive battle with the enemy under unfavorable conditions.
    Stalin said: "Some comrades think that attacking on all fronts at the same time is the basic symptom of the current revolutionary spirit. No, comrades, this is not right. At present (referring to the time after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution – Boda's note), attacking on all fronts is foolish, not revolutionary spirit. We must not confuse foolishness with revolutionary spirit." (Stalin: "Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University") But during the ten-year civil war, our "left"-leaning opportunists advocated attacking on all fronts regardless of the conditions, and confused foolishness with revolutionary spirit.
    Stalin said: "We cannot regard the revolutionary movement as a movement that is always rising. This is an unrealistic view of revolutionary books. Revolutions always proceed in curves. It attacks and destroys the old system in some areas, while suffering local failures and retreating in other areas." ("Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University") But during the ten-year civil war, our "left"-leaning opportunists thought that the revolution could only be a straight upward movement, and that the revolution could not have any curves. Therefore, they thought that if we were to attack, we could only attack on all fronts, or call it "all-out attack." If someone advocated attacking in some areas and retreating in another area, then they would "determine" that it was "opportunism."
    Stalin said: "We cannot put all the tasks on ourselves at once, or there will be a danger of not being able to support it." ("Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University") But during the ten-year civil war, our "left"-leaning opportunists advocated putting all the tasks of "overthrowing everything" and "attacking on all fronts," and all the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, on ourselves when our revolutionary forces were still very insufficient. If someone criticizes this approach, saying that "there will be a danger of not being able to support it," then they will definitely put a "opportunist" hat on that person.
    Obviously, since 1927, some comrades in our Party who have made various opportunist errors and opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line, whether on the question of the nature of the revolution or on the question of revolutionary tactics, whether on political issues or on military issues, have precisely forgotten the various lessons that Stalin refuted the Trotskyites in 1927, thus causing our revolution to suffer a lot of hardship.
    IV
    Comrade Mao Zedong is correct. Our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, finally overcame objective difficulties and subjective errors on the tortuous road, and carried out the revolution to victory, precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong's views on the nature of the Chinese revolution and on the strategy of the Chinese revolution are completely consistent with Stalin's ideas, and in the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, he developed Stalin's ideas on the Chinese revolution. During the First Great Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong tried his best to insist that the proletariat must lead the peasant anti-feudal revolutionary movement to support the anti-imperialist struggle, and opposed Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism. During the ten-year civil war, in the then land revolution movement, Comrade Mao Zedong always did not forget the extremely important political factor of anti-imperialism, and opposed "left"-leaning opportunism. Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic plan for building revolutionary base areas, and the policies stipulated for various classes, such as winning over the middle class, etc., all took the anti-imperialist factor into account. During the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong believed that the proletariat and its vanguard must mobilize the peasant masses in order for the Anti-Japanese War to have a broad mass base, and in order for the Anti-Japanese War to have the possibility of becoming a people's victory. Therefore, he waged an extremely tenacious struggle against right-leaning opportunist errors. History has proven that these struggles waged by Comrade Mao Zedong, who was consistent with Stalin's thinking, in various revolutionary periods, were correct. In particular, the struggle over the issue of the Party's line in the early and mid-stage of the Anti-Japanese War determined the overall situation of the victory of the Chinese revolution.
    Yes, it should be explained that Stalin's many works on the Chinese question had, for a long time, whether when Chen Duxiu was still in power in 1927, or after 1927, the opportunists always either intentionally or unintentionally hindered the dissemination and propaganda of Stalin's many works on the Chinese question within the Chinese Party. Also, due to the conditions of the language and the isolation of the counter-revolution, many comrades within our Party who actually led the Chinese revolution did not have the opportunity to systematically read Stalin's many works on the Chinese question, and Comrade Mao Zedong was one of them. Stalin's many works on the Chinese question were systematically compiled in our Party only after the rectification movement in 1942, and not long ago, Comrade Mao Zedong stipulated that the book "Lenin and Stalin on China" be compiled as one of the twelve essential reading books for cadres. The fact that opportunists, in order to spread their erroneous views and propositions, intentionally or unintentionally covered up Stalin's works on the Chinese question is very unfortunate for our Party. But even so, on many fundamental issues, Comrade Mao Zedong was able to reach the same conclusions as Stalin through his own independent thinking based on the basic revolutionary science of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, thereby maintaining his own correctness and that of his comrades.
    Comrade Mao Zedong had the opportunity to widely read Stalin's works during the Anti-Japanese War. Comrade Mao Zedong read and pondered with the greatest enthusiasm various works of Stalin that he obtained. Everyone knows that Comrade Mao Zedong, in his "On New Democracy," explained the important inspiration that Stalin's works gave him. Comrade Mao Zedong explained that the Chinese Communists put forward the correct proposition that the Chinese revolution is a part of the world socialist revolution based on Stalin's theory. Comrade Mao Zedong developed the idea of proletarian leadership based on Stalin's theory, and in this famous combat work of his, on the one hand, he severely attacked the reactionary dream of establishing a bourgeois dictatorship in China, and on the other hand, he severely attacked the Party's opportunism that attempted to make the proletariat follow the bourgeoisie.
    In many works written by Comrade Mao Zedong since the Anti-Japanese War, he particularly liked to chew on Stalin's famous saying that "the characteristic of the Chinese revolution is the armed people opposing the armed counter-revolution," and he particularly liked to chew on Stalin's famous saying that "the essence of the colonial and semi-colonial question is the peasant question." Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the situation in China, linked these two famous sayings of Stalin, developed them, and severely refuted the most basic concept and policy that opportunists in our Party during the Anti-Japanese War neglected that the proletariat must lead the peasant war.
    In order to prepare for the victory of our revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong launched the rectification movement in our Party in 1941-42. At this time, Comrade Mao Zedong particularly liked to repeatedly quote the two sentences in Stalin's masterpiece that ideologically armed the Bolsheviks of the world - "Foundations of Leninism" - on the relationship between theory and practice. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It is still Stalin who said it right: 'Theory that is not connected with practice is just empty theory.' Of course, it is again his saying that is right: 'Practice that is not connected with theory is just blind practice.'" Comrade Mao Zedong applied Stalin's former sentence to oppose dogmatism in our Party, and applied Stalin's latter sentence to oppose empiricism in our Party.
    Comrade Mao Zedong listed Stalin's twelve conditions for Bolshevization and the six articles of the conclusion of the History of the CPSU(B) as the most basic documents for our Party's rectification movement. In order to enable comrades to deeply consider these two documents of Stalin, Comrade Mao Zedong gave a very long speech, believing that these two documents were consistent things, and were a summary of the revolutionary experience led by Marxism-Leninism for a hundred years. Based on our Party's experience of more than twenty years, Comrade Mao Zedong explained these two documents one by one, and distinguished true Marxism-Leninism from false Marxism-Leninism. These two documents gave a heavy blow to dogmatism and empiricism in our rectification movement.
    In the document "Reform Our Study," Comrade Mao Zedong called on our Party to study Marxism-Leninism with Stalin's great work "History of the CPSU(B)" as the central teaching material. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "The History of the CPSU(B) is the highest comprehensive summary of the communist movement in the world for a hundred years, and is a typical example of the combination of theory and practice. In the whole world, there is only this complete typical example. We see how Lenin and Stalin combined the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete practice of the Soviet revolution, and then developed Marxism, and we can know how we should work in China."
    Comrade Mao Zedong is a student and comrade-in-arms of Stalin. The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong was able to become an excellent student of Stalin, and was able to become the leader of the victory of the Chinese revolution, is because his method of work and method of thinking is Stalin's method. He used Stalin's method to study Stalin. This method is the creative Marxist as Stalin said in the famous article written for Lenin's fiftieth birthday: "This faction does not seek instructions and policies in the same and similar things in history, but seeks instructions and policies by studying the surrounding circumstances. When working, they do not base themselves on citations and idioms, but on practical experience, and use experience to examine every step of their work, and learn from their mistakes and teach others to build a new life. Therefore, in the work of this faction, words and deeds are always consistent, and Marx's theory completely guarantees its own, lively, revolutionary power." Precisely because of this, Stalin's ideas and theories, once they reach the hands of Comrade Mao Zedong, "completely guarantee its own, lively, revolutionary power." In our Party, there are some people, these people are like the dogmatists we mentioned earlier, who may subjectively want to learn from Stalin, but they are learning from Stalin with the method of anti-Stalin, or as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Their methods of learning Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin violate Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." Their method is the dogmatist as Stalin said in the famous article written for Lenin's fiftieth birthday: "They do not base their work on experience, on the calculation of practical work, but on the sentences excerpted from Marx's works. They do not seek instructions and policies by analyzing practical life, but seek instructions and policies in the same and historically similar things. Inconsistent words and deeds - this is the basic drawback of this faction. Therefore, they are always discouraged and disappointed, and are always dissatisfied with the 'fate' that often deceives them."
    Stalin's theory, Stalin's methods and theories, through Comrade Mao Zedong's introduction and application, greatly enlightened the Chinese Communists' broad vision in politics and ideology, improved the Chinese Communists' Marxist-Leninist consciousness, and helped our Party have sufficient ideological strength to defeat any counter-revolution and any enemy that hinders the progress of the revolution.
    We have won a revolutionary victory. We need to continue to win. But how can we guarantee our continued victory? As Comrade Mao Zedong has often told us: We must be good at learning, we must be good at learning from the banner of mankind's great victory and our mentor - Stalin, and be good at learning from the great CPSU, and our method of learning is to be like Comrade Mao Zedong, using Marx's method, using Engels's method, using Lenin's method, using Stalin's method, in a word, using the method of combining theory and practice.
    Let us repeat what Comrade Mao Zedong said ten years ago at the celebration of Stalin's sixtieth birthday: "We must celebrate him, support him, and also learn from him."
    Learning from Stalin - this is still an important conclusion when we celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday.
    For the happiness and future of mankind, long live the supreme, glorious, and great Stalin!

    毛泽东同志在延安庆祝斯大林六十寿辰的大会上说过：“斯大林是世界革命的领导者。这是一个非常重要的事情。在全人类中间出了这位斯大林，这是一件大事，有了他，事情就好办了。你们知道，马克思是死了，恩格斯是死了，列宁也死了，如果没有一个斯大林，那一个来发号施令呢？这真是幸事。现在世界上有了一个苏联，有了一个共产党，又有了一个斯大林，这世界的事情就好办了。”毛泽东同志向我们中国党的同志指出：“我们要庆祝他，拥护他，还要学习他。我们要学习他两个方面，一个是道理方面，一个是事业方面。”
    毛泽东同志说明了斯大林发挥马克思列宁主义的功劳，说明了斯大林指导完成苏联社会主义建设事业是“开天辟地的大事”，说明了斯大林在道理方面与物质方面援助中国人民的事业。毛泽东同志说：“在过去，马克思列宁主义，在理论上指导世界革命，现在加了一点东西，可以在物质上帮助世界革命了，这就是斯大林的大功劳。”
    时间又过了十年，现在我们在庆祝斯大林同志的七十寿辰。这时间，正是在人类经过第二次世界大战、而以苏联为首的各国人民打倒德、意、日三个法西斯帝国之后，是在世界上出现了许多新的人民民主国家之后，是在中国人民打败了日本帝国主义、并接着进行推翻国民党反革命统治、驱逐美帝国主义侵略势力、因而得以建立中华人民共和国之后，是在苏联在世界上无比地强大、而以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义制度则正摇摇欲坠的时候，这十年来的一系列伟大历史事变，都是和斯大林的名字分不开的、都是和斯大林的事业分不开的，都是和斯大林对于各国人民的援助分不开的。十年来的世界历史事变，更加说明了斯大林不但是苏联人民胜利的旗帜，而且是世界一切进步人类胜利的旗帜，同时也更加说明了毛泽东同志在十年前所指出的：“斯大林是世界革命的领导者，这是非常重要的事情，在全人类中间，出了这位斯大林，这是一件大事，有了他，事情就好办了。”世界上有了这一位斯大林，“这真是幸事”呵！
    斯大林寿辰是世界的“人日”。中国人民能够和苏联人民一道，和世界上一切进步人类一道，来共同庆祝这一位自马克思恩格斯列宁以后、在人类解放事业上联系最普遍、成就最宽广的世界最伟大人物和天才导师的七十寿辰，这个庆祝本身也就是中国人民的幸事。这个庆祝本身就是庆祝人类的解放，庆祝人类的希望和将来。
    但我们中国人的庆祝斯大林，还有其特殊的方面，这就是：斯大林与中国革命的密切关系，斯大林的关心中国人民的命运及其在中国革命问题上所作的伟大理论贡献。
    二
    根据对于中国社会具体情况的具体分析，斯大林，这位唯物辩证法的科学大匠，世界的革命导师，在中国第一次大革命的时候，提出了关于中国革命的一系列问题，并对之作了极端英明的论断，粉碎了反革命托洛茨基派关于中国问题的胡说八道，帮助了中国党走上了布尔什维克的道路。斯大林在这个时期内关于中国问题的许多著作，正是革命理论与革命实际结合的模范，是马克思列宁主义理论宝库里面有关人类命运的重大一部分，那许多著作不但在当时是完全正确的，而且在二十几年来的中国革命实践中，也都证明是完全正确的。
    当中国人民初初露出自己的革命锋芒的时候，斯大林即已看出中国革命具有无限的力量。最近马林科夫在纪念十月革命的报告里面，曾特别引述斯大林在一九二五年的一段预见：
    “中国革命运动的力量是不可估量的。这种力量还没有能使自己确当地为人感觉出来。但是它们定会在将来使它自己被人感觉出来。看不到这种力量以及不给它们以应有估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要因此吃大苦头。”
    斯大林这一个预见，是建立在计算中国政治经济诸条件和中国社会内部各种力量对比的基础上面，同时也是建立在计算世界政治经济诸条件和世界各种力量对比的基础上面。
    关于中国方面，斯大林在一九二六年十一月间论中国革命前途的时候，曾经作过这样一个重要的估计：“中国革命主导者和领导者的作用，中国农民领袖的作用，不可免地要落在中国无产阶级及其政党的手中”。斯大林这个估计，是和中国民族资产阶级的软弱性这一点联系起来讲的。这是非常重要的估计。因为如果是这样，如果只有中国无产阶级才能成为中国革命的领导者，那么，中国农民及其他一切人民大众，就有可能在中国无产阶级领导之下，把自己的革命力量发挥到尽致，而这个占有地球上人口将四分之一的国家的人民大众，一旦能够作到这一点，那它就必然要改变世界的面貌。
    关于世界方面，显然的，斯大林是从列宁发明的帝国主义时代资本主义国家政治经济发展的不平衡性及其矛盾的特别尖锐化这一个著名的规律出发，因而估计到中国革命有可能跟着俄国十月社会主义革命继续在东方冲破帝国主义的阵线。斯大林又是从苏联的存在和强大这样一个事实出发，这就是斯大林在“论中国革命前途”所指出的：“与中国并列着的，还有苏联存在和发展着，它的革命经验和帮助不能不便利于中国无产阶级反对帝国主义和反对中国中世纪封建残余的斗争。”
    因为斯大林的预见是从坚固的科学基础上出发，他看到了中国人民斗争之异党深刻的性质，所以不论在什时候，不论中国革命曾经遇到如何重大的挫折，他都相信中国革命终将前进而取得胜利。当一九二七年蒋介石叛变革命之后，斯大林即驳斥了托洛茨基派把土耳其“基码尔式的革命”和中国革命混为一谈的胡说。斯大林分析了中国和土耳其的差别，认为在中国没有土耳其“基码尔式革命”的可能。斯大林说：
    “…在中国，帝国主义却不能不从民族的中国之活的肉体上开刀，把它割裂成许多块，夺取它的整个省份，以保持他们的旧有阵地，或者最低限度维持这些阵地的一部分。因此，要是在土耳其，反帝国主义的斗争可以基码尔主义者的斩了尾巴的反帝国主义的革命而告终，那么在中国，反帝国主义的斗争，一定要采取深刻的人民的和鲜明的民族的性质，一定要一步加深一步，一直到和帝国主义作拼命的决斗，震撼帝国主义在全世界的基础本身。”（斯大林：“与中山大学学生的谈话”）斯大林又指出：
    “在中国，不是中国的墨索里尼如张作霖张宗昌之类获得胜利，后来由土地革命的浪潮，把他们冲倒；就是武汉（指当时革命的武汉而言——伯达注）获得胜利。蒋介石及其党羽，企图在这两个阵营之间找一条中间路，他们不可免地要倒台，和张作霖、张宗昌遭受同一命运。”（斯大林：“与中山大学学生的谈话”）
    当汪精卫接着蒋介石继续叛变革命之后，斯大林又继续驳斥托洛茨基派关于中国革命破产的胡说，而断定中国没有改良主义的可能。斯大林说：
    “新旧军阀相互间的混战，又重新爆发起来，这个战争，不能不消弱反革命的力量，同时不能不使农民破产，怨天怨地；”
    “在中国还没有这样一个集团或这样一个政府，这样集团或政府能够实行类似基托里宾式的改良，可用作统治集团的避雷针和续命汤；”
    “要压抑那亟欲夺得地主土地的千千万万的农民，并使他们对土地垂头丧气，那是很不容易的；”
    “无产阶级在劳动群众当中的威信，一天一天在增强着，他们的力量是永远没有被歼灭的。；（斯大林：“时事问题简评：关于中国”）
    事实的发生是预言的试金石。
    一九二七年以来，在中国发生了一系列事变：蒋介石变成中国的墨索里尼而代替了张作霖，张宗昌，国民党新旧军阀互相间的不断混战，中国土地革命的浪潮，国民党反革命统治任何“改良主义”企图的破产，日本帝国主义——接着又是美帝国主义的在中国肉体上开刀，中国人民同日本帝国主义及美帝国主义作了拼命的决斗，这种斗争的震撼帝国主义在全世界上的基础，蒋介石走上了与张作霖张宗昌同一命运而从反革命的政治舞台上倒下来……这一系列的事变，完全证实了斯大林二十几年前的预见。
    斯大林的预见，在二十几年来鼓舞了中国人民的斗争，显出了革命科学是不可抵抗的力量，同时又暴露了托洛茨基派和一切反革命丑角替蒋介石汪精卫的反革命作无耻吹嘘的丑态。
    三
    一九二七年五月间，斯大林关于中国革命性质的问题，作了这样的概括：“今日的中国革命便是两支革命运动的巨流——反封建残余的革命运动与反帝国主义革命运动之汇合。中国资产阶级民主革命乃是反封建残余斗争与反帝国主义斗争之汇合。”（斯大林：“中国革命与共产党国际底任务”）这是斯大林精辟分析中国社会所得的结论。这是对于中国革命问题有很重大历史意义的结论。斯大林指出：这是当时“共产国际对于中国革命问题全部路线的出发点。”当时托洛茨基派正是反对了这样的路线。托派认为中国对外的问题只是海关的问题，因而否定了中国革命的反帝国主义性质；托派否认中国封建残余占有优势的作用，因而否定了中国革命的反封建性质。斯大林指出：托洛茨基及其喽罗们所持的这种观点乃是反革命的张作霖与蒋介石的观点。大家知道：中国托洛茨基派正是根据了托洛茨基全部反革命的观点，同时又根据其关于中国问题这种反革命的观点，而和各国托洛茨基派一道，走上了反革命的道路。
    斯大林说：“中国资产阶级民主革命，不仅在反对封建残余而已，它同时还反对帝国主义。”（斯大林：“中国革命与共产国际底任务”）必需根据中国社会的情况从而确定这样的革命性质，我们党才能正确地估计在每一个具体的历史场合上阶级关系的具体变化，以便规定革命的具体任务，组织革命的阵线，而引导革命向前迈进，并造成中国革命在中国工人阶级领导之下使资产阶级民主革命有长成为社会主义革命的可能性。一九二七年陈独秀机会主义就是反对了斯大林这个辩证法的分析的。陈独秀主义后来即和反革命的托洛茨基主义合流，这是大家都知道的，这里不准备去多说它。这里需要指出：一九二七年以后，二十几年来，在我们党内发生的或“左”或右的机会主义错误，也通常首先是在革命性质问题上违反了斯大林这个辩证法的分析，或者疏忽了反帝这一方面，或者疏忽了反封建这一方面。例如在十年内战期间内，犯“左”倾机会主义错误的同志就长期疏忽了反帝这一方面，疏忽了斯大林所指出的“中国革命之资产阶级民主性质，其锋芒是反帝国主义”（“中国革命与共产国际底任务”）；因而不善于利用形势去正确地组织反帝的阵线，以配合土地革命的斗争，而打破自己的孤立。他们在这一个时期内，并过早主张实行“社会主义革命转变”的冒险。又例如在抗日战争期间内，原来犯“左”倾机会主义错误的同志转而犯了右倾机会主义错误，他们的意见又正像一九二七年的陈独秀主义一样，疏忽了反封建这一方面，“只看见资产阶级”，“没有看见中国土地革命运动底决定的意义”，“不主张放开乡村里的革命，害怕农民革命破坏了反帝国主义统一战线”。当然，这种错误的意见也恰恰是直接反对了斯大林，因为按照斯大林的意见乃是这样的：“中国农民卷入革命越快越彻底，则中国反帝国主义的统一战线，亦将越强大越有力量。”（“论中国革命底前途”）这类右倾机会主义者在这一个时期内，既然否认了反封建这一方面，所以也就又和一九二七年的陈独秀主义一样，主张放弃无产阶级的领导权，只看到资产阶级的前途，而没有看到人民革命胜利的前途与社会主义的前途。
    很明显，关于中国革命性质的问题，是和中国革命每一个阶段的具体策略问题相联系的。如果他在革命性质的问题上犯了错误，那么他在具体的革命策略问题上，也就不能不犯错误。
    斯大林在驳斥托洛茨基派关于中国问题的胡说的时候，曾经特别说明了列宁主义的几个主要策略原则：
    “第一，在制定共产国际对于每个国度工人运动底领导指示时，务须要考虑到这些国度的民族特点与民族特殊性之原则；第二，各国共产党务须利用极小的可能以保证无产阶级须有群众同盟者之原则，即使这个群众同盟者是暂时的、动摇的、不坚定的、不可靠的也罢；第三，务须考虑到这个真理之原则，就是为了政治上教育千百万群众，仅仅是宣传和鼓动一项是不够的，为了这个目的，还需要群众自身的政治经验。”（斯大林：“时事问题简评：关于中国”）
    斯大林接着又着重地说明了马克思列宁主义一般原则与民族特点相合的问题。斯大林写道：
    “虽然我们党有思想上的增长，但是可惜的，在我们党内还存在着某种类的“领导者”，这些“领导者”诚恳地相信，可以根据电报，可以根据某些公认的共产国际的一般原则来领导中国革命，而无须考虑到中国经济、中国政治制度、中国文化、中国道德、中国传统的民族特点。这些“领导者”与真正领导者的区别，就是不论任何时候他们的怀中总有着两三个现成的、适用于一切国度和任何条件之下的所“必须”的公式。考虑到每个国度底民族特点和民族特殊性的问题，对于他们是不存在的。把共产国际的一般原则，跟每个国度里革命运动之民族特点联系起来的问题，使共产国际的一般原则适用于个别国度底民族国家特点的问题，对于他们是不存在的。他们不懂得，在各国共产党已经长大而成为群众性的政党的现在，领导底主要任务，就在于发现、掌握及善于把每个国度革命运动底民族独有的特征，跟共产国际的一般原则结合起来，以便促进和在实践上使共产主义运动的基本目标能够实现。因此，便企图把一切国度的领导千篇一律化。因此，便企图机械地搬用若干一般的公式，不考虑到个别国度里革命运动之具体条件。因此，在公式与个别国度里革命运动之间便发生了永久的冲突，这些冲突乃是这些不幸领导者领导之基本结果。”（同上）
    斯大林特别地用中国的革命性质问题来说明中国的革命策略问题，并从而驳斥了托派关于中国革命性质问题上同时又是关于中国革命策略问题上的胡说。斯大林把中国革命性质的问题和中国革命策略的问题联系起来，而指出了并概括了中国革命的民族特点。
    斯大林这里所阐述的思想，用毛泽东同志平常的语言来说，就是：马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的思想。一九二七年以来，我们党内的教条主义者，他们又犯“左”的或右的机会主义者，他们的错误，也正是忘记了斯大林这个驳斥托洛茨基派的教训，而认为领导中国革命，只需要他们的怀中有两三个现成的、“适用”于一切国度和在任何条件之下所“必须”的公式就够用了。考虑到中国民族特点和民族特殊性的问题，对于他们是不存在的。因此，在他们机械搬用若干的公式与中国的具体革命之间便发生了永久的冲突。
    我们的教条主义者把自己限制在抽象的公式和简单的历史类比里面，而不从中国的具体情况出发，因此，就不可免地在中国革命性质的问题上，或在这个时候犯了这个错误，或在那个时候犯了那个错误；又因此，他们也就不能按照具体情况的变化而把原则性与灵活性结合起来，不能如斯大林所说：为了击败强大的敌人，“就需要有无产阶级的灵活和深思熟虑的政策，就需要善于利用敌人阵营里的每个空隙，善于给自己找寻同盟者”（“时事问题简评：关于中国”）。我们的教条主义者在十年内战时期主张一切打倒，或者如毛泽东同志对他们的嘲笑：“在朝的打不倒，就要打倒在野的。人家已经在野了，你还要打倒他”。但在另一个历史场合，例如在抗日战争的场合，他们却又转到主张一切联合，而否认抗日统一战线里有左中右三派，否认我们党对于这三派的政策应有的区别。又因此，他们也就不会按照具体情况去认真联系群众，而是对于群众实行一联串的命令主义。斯大林说：“必须要使群众自己根据亲身的经验去认识国民党领导当局底不可靠性、反动性、反革命性。”但是我们的教条主义者忘记了斯大林这个教训，以为只要少数“领导者”认识，就可发号施令使群众跟着来了。斯大林说：“革命不仅是先锋队、不仅是个别的即使是“伟大”的“人物”所“干”的，并且首先，而且主要地是千千万万的人民大群来干的。”但是我们的教条主义者忘记了斯大林这个教训，以为革命首先、而且主要地是他们几个自以为是的“领导人物”所“干”的。
    三十年来的中国事变，说明了中国革命进行的极端复杂性与极端曲折性，而这种极端复杂性与极端曲折性，特别是由反帝斗争与反封建斗争的复杂地和曲折地交错所引起的。这样，也就引起了一系列的革命策略问题，引起了统一战线的问题，引起了革命在城乡之间关系的问题，同时也引起了军事斗争重要战略的问题。正如斯大林所说：“在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命”。这样武装斗争的进攻重点，在什么时候需要放在什么地方？是否在进攻中还有防御或退却？进攻与防御或退却如何互相结合？防御或退却又如何转变为进攻？大家知道，这等等一系列的问题，乃是毛泽东同志在长期中和机会主义（时而冒险主义，时而逃跑主义）斗争的重要部分，而凡是反对毛泽东同志的，正是反对了斯大林。
    在一九二七年，蒋介石在上海发动叛变之后，发生了革命战争的战略问题，当时托派是主张冒险对上海进攻的。斯大林反对了这种冒险。当时斯大林说：“上海是各帝国主义集团重要利益交错底世界中心”。斯大林主张要“在军事上充分准备，尽量发展土地革命，进行紧张的工作，以破坏蒋介石的前线与后方，然后再提出上海的全部问题。”（斯大林：“与中山大学学生的谈话”）因为“在不顺利条件之下，要是不避免（要是可以避免的时候）决死的战斗，这等于帮助革命的敌人。”（斯大林：“中国革命问题”）但在十年内战时期内，我们的“左”倾机会主义者就恰恰主张在力量悬殊的条件之下对大城市进行简单盲目冒险的进攻，主张在不顺利的条件之下要和敌人进行决死的战斗。
    斯大林说：“有些同志以为在一切战线上同时进攻，是现在革命精神底基本征候。不，同志们，这是不对的，在目前（指当时在蒋介石叛变革命之后——伯达注）在一切战线上进攻，乃是愚蠢，而不是革命精神。不能把愚蠢和革命精神混为一谈。”（斯大林：“与中山大学学生的谈话”）但在十年内战时期内，我们的“左”倾机会主义者，就恰恰不管在什么条件下，都主张在一切战线上进攻，而把愚蠢和革命精神混为一谈。
    斯大林说：“不能把革命运动看作一直上升的运动。这是对于革命的书本的非现实的观念。革命总是曲线进行的，它在一些地区里进攻和破坏了旧制度，而在其他区域里却遭受到局部的失败，实行退守。”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）但在十年内战时期，我们的“左”倾机会主义者，就恰恰认为革命只能是笔直上升的运动，革命的进行是不能有什么曲线的，因此，他们就认为要进攻的话，就只能全线进攻，或叫做“全线出击”。如果有人主张要在一些区域进攻，而要在另一个区域退守，那么他们就要“断定”那是“机会主义”的。
    斯大林说：“不能一下子把一切任务放在自己身上，这会有支持不住的危险。”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）但在十年内战时期内，我们的“左”倾机会主义者，就恰恰当我们革命力量还很不足的时候，主张一下子把“一切打倒”、“全线进攻”的一切任务，把资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命的一切任务，都放在自己身上。如果有人批评这种做法“会有支持不住的危险”，那么，他们也就一定会给人家戴上一顶“机会主义”的帽子。
    很明显，一九二七年以来，我们党内一些先后犯各种机会主义错误而反对毛泽东同志正确路线的同志，不论在革命性质问题上或革命策略问题上，不论在政治问题上或在军事问题上，都正是忘记了斯大林在一九二七年驳斥托洛茨基派的各种教训，因而使我们革命的进行尝过了不少的苦头。
    四
    毛泽东同志是正确的。我们党在毛泽东同志领导之下，终于在曲折的道路上，克服了客观的困难和主观的错误，而把革命进行到胜利，就是因为毛泽东同志关于中国革命性质问题，关于中国革命策略问题，是和斯大林的思想完全一致的，并在中国革命的具体实践中，发展了斯大林关于中国革命问题的思想。毛泽东同志在第一次大革命时间内，就极力坚持无产阶级必须领导农民反封建的革命运动以支持反帝国主义的斗争，而反对了陈独秀的右倾机会主义。在十年内战时期内，在当时的土地革命运动中，毛泽东同志则又始终不忘记反帝国主义这一个极端重大的政治因素，而反对了“左”倾机会主义。毛泽东同志关于建设革命根据地的战略计划，以及所规定的对各阶级的政策如争取中间阶级等等，都正是把反帝国主义这一个因素计算在内的。在抗日战争时期中，毛泽东同志认为无产阶级及其先锋队必须发动农民群众才能使抗日战争得到广泛的群众基础，才能使抗日战争有成为人民的胜利的可能，因此就和右倾机会主义的错误作了极顽强的斗争。历史证明：与斯大林思想相一致的毛泽东同志在各个革命时期内进行的这些斗争都是正确的，特别是在抗日战争的初期和中期关于党的路线问题的斗争，乃是决定了现在中国革命胜利的全局。
    不错，应该说明这么一个事实：斯大林关于中国问题的许多著作曾经在很长的时候，不论是在一九二七年陈独秀还在当权的时候，或在一九二七年以后，机会主义者总是或有意地或无意地阻拦在中国党内散布和宣传斯大林关于中国问题的许多著作，又因为文字的条件，反革命的隔离，就使得我们党内许多在实际上领导中国革命的同志没有机会去有系统地阅读到斯大林关于中国问题的许多著作，而毛泽东同志也是其中的一个。斯大林关于中国问题的许多著作是一九四二年整风运动以后，才在我们党内有系统地编辑出来，而在不久以前，并经过毛泽东同志规定编出“列宁斯大林论中国”一书为十二本干部必读书之一。机会主义者为着散布自己错误的观点和主张，而或有意地或无意地掩盖斯大林关于中国问题的著作，这一点对我们党说来，是很不幸的。但虽然这样，毛泽东同志在许多根本问题上，却能根据马、恩、列、斯的革命基本科学，以自己独立的思考达到了与斯大林相同的结论，因而保持了自己和他的战友们的正确。
    毛泽东同志有机会宽泛地阅读斯大林的著作，是在抗日战争的时候。毛泽东同志用最高的热情，来阅读和深思熟虑他所得到的斯大林的各种著作。大家知道：毛泽东同志在他所写的“新民主主义论”里面，就说明了斯大林的著作所给他的重要的启发。毛泽东同志说明了中国共产党人提出关于中国革命是世界社会主义革命的一部分这一个正确的命题是根据斯大林的理论的。毛泽东同志根据斯大林的理论发挥了无产阶级领导权的思想，而在他这部著名的战斗著作里面，一方面迎头痛击了关于在中国建立资产阶级专政的反动梦想，另方面则迎头痛击了企图使无产阶级追随资产阶级的党内机会主义。
    毛泽东同志在抗日战争以来所写的许多著作里面，特别喜欢咀嚼斯大林关于“中国革命的特点是武装的人民反对武装的反革命”这一句名言，又特别喜欢咀嚼斯大林关于“殖民地半殖民地的问题实质上就是农民问题”这一句名言。毛泽东同志根据中国的情况，把斯大林这两句名言联系起来，加以发挥，而严厉驳斥了抗日战争时期我们党内机会主义者忽视无产阶级必须领导农民战争这一个最基本的观念与政策。
    为着准备我们革命的胜利，毛泽东同志在一九四一——四二年发动了我们党内的整风运动，这时毛泽东同志特别喜欢反复引用了斯大林那部在思想上武装全世界布尔什维克的杰作——“列宁主义基础”里面关于理论与实践相互关系的两句话。毛泽东同志说：“依然是斯大林的话说得对：“不与实践相联系的理论只是空洞的理论”。当然又是他是话对：“不与理论相联系的实践只是盲目的实践”。”毛泽东同志应用了斯大林的前一句话，去反对我们党内的教条主义，而应用斯大林的后一句话，去反对我们党内的经验主义。
    毛泽东同志把斯大林论布尔什维克化的十二条件和联共党史结束语六条列为我们党整风运动最基本的文件。毛泽东同志为着使同志们能够深思熟虑斯大林这两个文件，特别作了一次很长的演讲，他认为这两个文件是一致的东西，是一百年来马克思列宁主义领导革命经验的总结。毛泽东同志根据我们党二十几年的经验，对于这两个文件，逐条逐条地加以解释，而区别了真的马克思列宁主义与假的马克思列宁主义。这两个文件在我们整风运动中是给了教条主义和经验主义以沉重打击的。
    毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”的文件中，号召我们党内研究马克思列宁主义应以斯大林的伟大著作“联共党史”为中心教材。毛泽东同志写道：“联共党史是一百年来全世界共产主义运动的最高的综合与总结，是理论与实际结合的典型，在全世界上还只有这个完全的典型。我们看列宁斯大林他们是如何把马克思主义的普遍真理与苏联革命的具体实践互相结合，又从而发展马克思主义的，就可以知道我们在中国是应该如何工作了。”
    毛泽东同志是斯大林的学生和战友。毛泽东同志之所以能够成为斯大林的优秀学生，能够成为中国革命胜利的领导者，也就是因为他的工作方法和思想方法是斯大林的方法，他用斯大林的方法去学习斯大林。这种方法就是如斯大林在为列宁五十寿辰而作的名文中所说的创造的马克思主义者：“这一派人不是在历史上相同的事情和相象的事情里面去求得指示和方针，而是由研究周围的情形中去求得指示和方针。在工作时，他们不拿引证和成语来作根据，而是拿实际经验来作根据，拿经验来审查自己的每一步的工作，在自己的错误中来学习和教训别人去建设新生活。所以，在这一派人底工作中，言行总是一致的，马克思的学说，完全保证着自己的、活泼的、革命的力量。”正因为如此，所以斯大林的思想和学说，一到了毛泽东同志的手里，也就“完全保证着自己的、活泼的、革命的力量”。在我们党内，有些人，这些人就象我们前面所说的教条主义者，他们在主观上或许是想学斯大林，可是他们是用反斯大林的方法去学习斯大林，或正如毛泽东同志所说：“他们学习马、恩、列、斯的方法则是违反马、恩、列、斯的。”他们的方法也就是如斯大林在为列宁五十寿辰而作的名文中所说的教条主义者：“他们不拿经验、不拿实际工作的计算来作工作的根据，却拿那些从马克思著作中摘录下来的语句来作工作的根据。他们不在分析实际生活中去求得指示和方针，却在相同的事情和历史上相象的事情里面去求得指示和方针。言行不符——这就是这一派人的基本弊病。因此，他们总是灰心失望，始终都是不满于那个常欺骗他们的‘厄运’。”
    斯大林的学说，斯大林的方法和理论，经过毛泽东同志的介绍和运用，极大地启发了中国共产党人在政治上、思想上的广阔眼界，提高了中国共产党人的马克思列宁主义自觉，帮助我们党有足够的思想力量，可以打败任何反革命和任何阻碍革命前进的敌人。
    我们已获得一个革命的胜利。我们需要继续胜利。但如何能够保证我们的继续胜利呢？正如毛泽东同志经常所告诉我们的：我们必须善于学习，必须善于向人类伟大胜利的旗帜和我们的导师——斯大林学习，善于向伟大的联共党学习，而我们学习的方法就是要象毛泽东同志一样，用马克思的方法，用恩格斯的方法，用列宁的方法，用斯大林的方法，一句话，用理论与实践相结合的方法。
    还是重复毛泽东同志十年前在庆祝斯大林六十寿辰时所说的话：“我们要庆祝他，拥护他，还要学习他。”
    向斯大林学习——这仍然是我们庆祝斯大林七十寿辰时的重要结论。
    为着人类的幸福和将来，至高无上的、光荣的、伟大的斯大林万岁！
