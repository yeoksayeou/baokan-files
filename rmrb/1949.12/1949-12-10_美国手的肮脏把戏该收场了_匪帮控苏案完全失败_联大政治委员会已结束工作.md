Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 9th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political and Security Committee concluded its work on the 6th.

　　On the 5th and 6th, the Political Committee continued to discuss the Kuomintang representative's slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union. As previously reported, the slanderous accusation that the Soviet Union violated the Sino-Soviet Treaty has completely failed. Even the United States delegation refused to support the Kuomintang's proposal in the Political Committee, a proposal that groundlessly condemned the Soviet Union and demanded that United Nations member states not recognize the government of the People's Republic of China.

　　The delegations of Cuba, Ecuador, and Peru, apparently seeking a way out of the deadlock that had arisen, proposed at the meeting on the 5th a new proposal to refer the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations to the General Assembly's so-called "Interim Committee" (i.e., the Small Assembly—the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia did not participate in this committee) so that this committee could make recommendations to the next session of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　U.S. Representative Jessup opposed the above-mentioned suggestion from the three countries, saying that the U.S. delegation believed that referring this issue to the "Interim Committee" would not guarantee finding a new basis for the General Assembly to resolve this issue. Jessup insisted on passing the five-nation joint proposal put forward by the United States, Australia, Mexico, Brazil (Pakistan), and the Philippines.

　　The Australian representative also spoke against this proposal, saying that there was no benefit in referring the issue to the "Interim Committee."

　　The Political Committee adjourned the meeting on the 5th because it could not reach any agreement, in order to "have time to study new suggestions."

　　On the 6th, U.S. Representative Jessup issued a statement indicating that the U.S. delegation had changed its attitude. He said that he was prepared to support the "three-country draft" as revised by the Philippines.

　　Sources at the United Nations General Assembly pointed out that the change in the U.S. delegation's attitude was due to strong pressure from certain groups in Congress on the State Department, which continue to demand support for Chiang Kai-shek.

　　The Uruguayan representative proposed an amendment to the "three-country draft," suggesting that the "Interim Committee" should draw the Security Council's attention to the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations. This amendment was fully endorsed and supported by the Kuomintang representative. However, even the Greek representative opposed this amendment, pointing out that the "Interim Committee" was an agency of the General Assembly during recess and therefore could not deal directly with the Security Council.

　　The joint proposal of Cuba, Ecuador, and Peru, after several revisions, was passed in the committee with a narrow majority of twenty-three votes, with nineteen votes against and fourteen abstentions. Voting against were the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Australia, Bolivia, Belarus, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Israel, Liberia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Syria, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The revised proposal requested the General Assembly to declare: that the General Assembly believes that the issue raised by the Kuomintang representative requires further study, and refers this issue to the General Assembly's "Interim Committee" to be studied "with reference to the five-nation proposal," and to submit a report to the next session of the General Assembly, or to draw the attention of the United Nations Secretary-General, who should submit a report on this issue to the Security Council when he deems it necessary.

　　Subsequently, the "five-nation proposal" was passed with the usual U.S.-British majority; it contained only some vague declarations and avoided directly mentioning opposition to the slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union and the suggestion not to recognize the People's Republic of China.

　　The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against this proposal, believing that even in this form, the proposal still substantially supported the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and considered it an impermissible attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Chinese people.

　　The agenda of the Political and Security Committee has now been discussed in full, and it has therefore concluded its work.

　　美国手的肮脏把戏该收场了
  　匪帮控苏案完全失败
    联大政治委员会已结束工作
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治安全委员会已于六日结束工作。
    五日和六日，政治委员会继续讨论了国民党代表对苏联的诽谤性的控诉案。正如前所报道的，诬告苏联破坏中苏条约的诽谤性控诉，业已完全失败。甚至连美国代表团也在政治委员会上拒绝支持国民党的提案，这个提案毫无根据地谴责苏联，并要求联合国会员国不要承认中华人民共和国政府。
    古巴、厄瓜多尔与秘鲁的代表团，显然是为了从已经产生的僵局中寻求解脱的办法，而在五日的会议上提出了新的提案建议将国民党诽谤性的控诉案交由大会的所谓“临时委员会”（即小型大会）来考虑（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克都没有参加这个委员会），以便由这个委员会向下届联合国大会提出建议。
    美国代表耶塞普反对上述三国的建议，他说，美国代表团认为将这一问题转交给“临时委员会”，并不能保证为大会解决这个问题求得一个新的基础。耶塞普坚持要通过由美、澳、墨、巴（基斯坦）、菲所提出的五国联合提案。
    澳大利亚代表的发言也反对这一提案，他说，将问题交到“临时委员会”并没有什么好处。
    政治委员会因为不能达到任何协议，就停止了五日的会议，以便“有时间来研究新的建议”。
    六日，美国代表耶塞普发表声明，表明美国代表团已改变态度。他说，他准备支持由菲律宾修改过的“三国草案”。
    联合国大会方面人士指出：美国代表团态度的改变，是由于国会某些集团给了国务院强大压力的缘故，这些集团继续在要求支持蒋介石。
    乌拉圭代表提出对于“三国草案”的修正案，建议“临时委员会”应提请安理会注意国民党诽谤性的控诉案。这一修正案得到了国民党代表的充分赞同和支持，但是，甚至连希腊代表都反对这一修正案，希腊代表指出，“临时委员会”是大会休会期间的机构，因而不能与安理会直接办交涉。
    古巴、厄瓜多尔与秘鲁的三国联合提案，在经过若干修正后，在委员会中以细微的多数二十三票通过，有十九票反对，十四票弃权。投反对票的是苏联、乌克兰、澳大利亚、玻利维亚、白俄罗斯、加拿大、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、以色列、里比利亚、墨西哥、荷兰、挪威、波兰、沙特阿拉伯、瑞典、叙利亚、美国和英国。修正后的这个提案，要求大会宣布：大会认为国民党代表所提出的这个问题，需要作进一步的研究，并将这一问题提交大会“临时委员会”，“参照五国提案”加以研究，并向下届大会提出报告，或促使联合国秘书长注意，在他认为必要时应当向安理会提出关于这个问题的报告。
    其后，又以照例的美英多数通过了“五国提案”；其中只是一些空泛的宣言，而避免直接谈到反对苏联的诽谤性的控诉以及不承认中华人民共和国的建议。
    苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克代表团，投票反对这一提案，认为即使在这种形式下，这个提案实质上还是支持了国民党对苏联和中华人民共和国的诽谤性控诉，并认为这是干涉中国人民内政的不可容许的企图。
    政治安全委员会的议程至此已讨论完毕。因而也就结束了它的工作。
