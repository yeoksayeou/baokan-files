Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th: Following the issuance of instructions by the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau a month ago regarding the large-scale training of rural Party member cadres, Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar provinces actively prepared and are now beginning training. The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee instructed local committees and county committees to convene special meetings to thoroughly discuss the instructions of the North China Bureau, and decided that local committees would be responsible for training personnel in the leadership training classes of each county, with local committee leaders personally giving lectures. Each county's training class is expected to run for three to four sessions, with each administrative village drawing seven to ten Party member cadres in batches to participate. The training focuses on new democratic construction, materialist historical view education, current affairs education, and Party building as the main educational content. After returning to their villages, the trained Party members will be responsible for relaying the information in their branches and using winter schools to publicize the Party's policies. The CCP Hebei Provincial Committee decided that in addition to conducting training for Party member cadres, it will also organize general training for 800,000 Party members throughout the province. Training for Party member cadres began in early December and is the responsibility of the county committees. General training for Party members does not involve leaving production, and can be carried out in batches and phases with several villages as a unit, under the responsibility of the district committees. To accomplish this significant political task, the Provincial Committee instructed local committees to have dedicated personnel in charge and to personally assist key counties to gain experience and promote comprehensive work; county committees and district committees should dedicate at least one-third of their strength to specifically leading and managing the work of training Party members. Currently, Ping Shan and Quyang counties in Hebei Province have begun holding training classes, with over 660 Party member cadres receiving training. Huai'an, HuaiRen, Xuanhua, and Yuxian counties in Chahar Province have also begun training. The number of trainees in the first session of each county ranges from 300 to 600.

(Hebei News) The Quyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party utilized the winter slack season to hold the first session of the rural Party member cadre training class for ten days starting on the seventh of last month. 233 trainees attended, and the training class was led by 36 county and district cadres. Before the start of learning, cadres leading the study held informal discussions with the trainees to discover the main ideological problems among the trainees. After the study began on the 8th, the trainees were first mobilized to concentrate on their studies. For the first three days, the time spent on lectures and group discussions was equal, focusing on the education of basic Party member knowledge to help trainees understand the great goals and revolutionary future of communist party members. On the fourth day, examples of peasant thinking were discussed and criticized from a proletarian standpoint. Subsequently, the focus shifted to individual ideological examinations by village. Key members were cultivated ahead of time with planned goals, and specific problems were pointed out as focal points for the examination. For villages with factional conflicts, the main Party member cadres were first mobilized to conduct in-depth self-criticism to influence the other party, and a model report meeting was also organized. Afterwards, the tasks of the branch were discussed, and each group thoroughly studied specific methods for solving the main problems in their villages. Finally, the central tasks were assigned and discussed.

The content of the teaching materials not only covered regulations but also focused on connecting to practical problems and providing many examples to encourage trainees to conduct in-depth examinations and discussions.

Through this study, many ideological problems of the trainees were resolved. According to understanding gained before the training, Party members in eight villages had sectarian ideas, new and old cadres were not united in fifteen villages, thirteen villages had serious selfish and self-interested ideas, and were not active in their work. After studying, everyone realized the errors of these thoughts and resolved to "throw the ideological baggage in Maguzhuang (the training location)". In-depth self-criticisms were also conducted. For example, Zheng Wancheng from Zhangjiayu criticized his factionalism and disregard for production, and Zheng Xinkuan criticized his failure to do work, resolving to correct their mistakes. After the work was assigned, Party members in each village swore an oath to the Party and wrote a letter to the county committee, guaranteeing that they would do a good job.

　　晋冀察等省执行华北局指示
  　训练农村党员干部
    曲阳县首批二百余人训练完毕
    【新华社北京十日电】中共中央华北局于月前发出关于大量训练农村党员干部的指示以后，山西、河北、哈察尔省即积极准备筹办，现已开始训练。中共山西省委曾指示各地委、县委召开专门会议，深入讨论华北局的指示，并决定各地委负责训练各县领导训练班的人员，由地委负责人亲自上课。各县的训练班预计办理三期到四期，每个行政村分期抽调七个到十个党员干部参加。该项训练以新民主主义建设、唯物史观教育，时事教育和党的建设为主要教育内容。受训党员回村后要负责在支部中进行传达，并且利用冬学，宣传党的政策。中共河北省委决定除进行党员干部训练外，并组织全省八十万党员的普训工作。党员干部训练于十二月上旬开始，由县委会负责。党员普训时不脱离生产，可以几个村为一单位，分批分期进行，由区委负责。为着完成这一重大的政治任务，省委指示各地委都要有专人负责，并亲自帮助重点县，以吸取经验，推动全面；县委、区委至少要以三分之一的力量来专门领导和管理训练党员的工作。目前河北省的平山、曲阳两县已开始举办训练班，受训党员干部六百六十余人。察哈尔省的怀安、怀仁、宣化、蔚县等县亦已开始训练。各县第一期训练人数，都在三百人至六百人之间。
    【河北讯】中共曲阳县委利用冬闲于上月七日起以十天时间举办了第一期农村党员干部集训班。受训学员二百三十三名，集训班由三十六名县区干部领导学习。学习前，由领导学习的干部与学员漫谈，发现学员中主要的思想问题；八日学习开始后，首先动员大家安心学习。最初三天讲授和小组讨论的时间相等，着重进行党员基本知识的教育，使学员了解共产党员革命的伟大目标和革命前途。第四天讲农民思想例证，并从无产阶级立场上予以批判。随后转入以村为单位进行个人思想检查，事先有计划有目的地培养骨干，并指出一定问题作检查重点；对有宗派矛盾的村庄先动员主要党员干部深刻检讨，以影响对方，还组织了大会典型报告。接着讲了支部的任务，各组都详细研究了解决本村主要问题的具体办法。最后布置并讨论了中心工作。
    教材内容，不单讲条文，主要联系实际问题多举例证，以启发学员深入检查与讨论。
    经过这次学习，学员的许多思想问题获得解决。据受训前了解。八个村党员有宗派思想，十五个村新老干部不团结，十三个村有严重的自私自利思想，工作不积极。学习以后，大家认识了这些思想的错误，决心“把思想包袱扔在马古庄（受训地点）”。并深刻作了自我检讨。如张家峪郑万成检讨了闹派别不顾生产，郑心宽检讨了不干工作等错误，决心改正。在布置工作后，各村党员向党宣誓，并给县委写信，保证把工作搞好。
