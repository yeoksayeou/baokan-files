　　Don't Speak Carelessly
　　Jiang Feng
　　A primary school teacher, giving a sixth-grade language lesson on "The People's Liberation Army Crossing the Yangtze," when speaking about the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze in small sailboats, a primary school student asked: "What if the boat is overturned by the enemy?" The teacher answered: "They can swim back while tied to lifeboats." At this point, a clever student asked again: "Why not swim to the other side?" Another student answered for him: "There are enemies on the other side." Thereupon, the teacher, as if to defuse the situation, echoed: "Right, wouldn't that be suicide?" This is not only casually answering the question based on mere assumptions but also "explaining" away the People's Liberation Army's spirit of bravery and fearlessness of sacrifice, which is contrary to the basic spirit of the textbook lesson.
　　For a primary school teacher, it is common to be stumped by some difficult questions due to limited political understanding because primary school students often have unexpected imaginations. They also like to get to the bottom of things by asking about the reasons, and sometimes their ideas are indeed smarter and more reasonable than ours, as evidenced by the second questioner in this story. His doubt—"Why not swim to the other side?"—not only embodied the PLA's heroic spirit in combat but also his understanding that in such circumstances, if the boat were overturned and swimming was possible, one should swim to the other side to attack the enemy, which makes sense, because the purpose of crossing the river is to go to the other side to eliminate the enemy.
　　It is possible that teachers occasionally fail to consider problems thoroughly, but like this case, after being reminded by the student, the teacher should humbly reflect and analyze, and praise this clever student for his skepticism and intelligent understanding. However, this teacher echoed another student's wrong answer to defuse the situation for himself, either out of concern for face or measuring the People's Liberation Army's high political awareness with his own backward thinking. Of course, this teacher might also be unfamiliar with combat life and made assumptions, but regardless of the reason, the teaching attitude should strive to be honest: admit what is not clear, consult others and then answer, and don't just speak carelessly based on assumptions!

　　不要信口开河
    江风
    一位小学教师，上六年级的国语课，讲“人民解放军渡长江”，讲到人民解放军渡长江是乘用小帆船的时候，一位小学生发问：“假使船被敌人打翻了怎么办？”教师解答说：“可以系着救生船游回来。”这时一位聪明的学生又发问：“为什么不游到对岸去呢？”另一位学生代为解答：“对岸有敌人呀。”于是教师解围似的附和说：“对呵，那不是送死吗？”这不仅是想当然地随便解答问题，而且把人民解放军英勇不怕牺牲的精神“解释”掉了，这与那一课教材的基本精神是相违背的。
    作小学教师，限于政治水平，被一些难解的问题难住的事是常有的，因为小学生们常常有些出人意外的想象力，他们又爱寻根究底的追问情由，而且，有时候他们的想法确实比我们更聪明而合理，比如这个故事中的第二位发问者就是明证，他这怀疑——“为什么不游到对岸去？”——不仅体会了人民解放军作战的英勇精神，而且他理解到在那样的情况下，假如船被打翻了而又可能在水上游的话，就应该向对岸游去进攻敌人，才合情理，因为渡江的目的就是要到对岸去消灭敌人的。
    教师们偶尔考虑问题不周密也是可能的，但象这样既被学生提醒，就应当虚心地加以思索和分析，并表扬这位聪明学生的善于怀疑和聪明的理解才好。而这位教师却附和了另一学生的错误解答以替自己解围，不是面子问题作怪，就是以自己的落后思想来衡量人民解放军的高度的政治觉悟。当然，这位教师可能也不熟悉战斗生活而想当然，但且不管原因何在，教学态度应力求老实：弄不清楚的事就承认弄不清楚，请教于别人后再答复，不要这样想当然地信口开河！
