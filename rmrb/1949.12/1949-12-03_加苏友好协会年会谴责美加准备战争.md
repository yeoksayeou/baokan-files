　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th, TASS Ottawa, December 29th: Canadian scientist and renowned journalist, Carter, emphasized the necessity of establishing trade relations between Canada and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries when he delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the National Committee of the Canada-Soviet Friendship Association in Toronto recently. Carter also advocated for scientific and cultural exchanges between Canada and the Soviet Union. He cited the Soviet Union's great achievements in science in agriculture, especially the brilliant achievements in the development of the northern regions (these regions are very similar to Canada's environment). He said these achievements would be of great benefit to the Canadian people. Carter also mentioned that the Soviet Union was the first country to begin using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. He sharply condemned Canada and the United States for engaging in war preparations, believing that this not only violated the interests of world peace, but also the interests of the Canadian and American people.
　　The meeting elected a National Committee of the Canada-Soviet Friendship Association with Carter as chairman and sent a telegram to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to express its respect.

　　加苏友好协会年会谴责美加准备战争
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社渥太华二十九日讯：加拿大科学家、名记者卡特尔，日前在多伦多举行的加苏友好协会全国委员会年会上发表演说时，强调加拿大与苏联、中华人民共和国及人民民主国家建立贸易关系的必要性。卡特尔同时并主张加拿大与苏联进行科学和文化的交流。他举出苏联科学在农业方面的伟大成就，特别是在发展北部地区（这些地区与加拿大的环境非常相似）上，有着辉煌的成就。他说这些成就对于加拿大人民是有很大好处的。卡特尔也提到苏联是第一个开始把原子能用在和平事业上的国家。他尖锐地谴责加拿大和美国正从事战争准备。认为这不但违反了世界和平的利益，也违反了加拿大人民和美国人民的利益。
    该会选出以卡特尔为主席的加苏友好协会全国委员会，并致电苏联对外文化关系协会表示敬意。
