Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 14th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government invited democratic personages from all walks of life and some participants of the incident to hold a symposium on the 13th anniversary of the "Double Twelfth" Incident. Among those present were democratic personages Zhang Xiangchu, Yang Zikang, Zuo Xiezong, and Su Zichen, Wang Yishan, Sun Fucheng, and Yang Zhengmin, the son of General Yang Hucheng, who were personally involved at the time, totaling more than 80 people. Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Zhao Shoushan, Deputy Commander of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, also attended. The symposium was presided over by Chang Lifu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. Before the symposium began, all attendees observed three minutes of silence for the martyred heroes. The attendees expressed unusual concern for Generals Zhang and Yang, who are still imprisoned in Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. (Note: It has now been confirmed that General Yang was murdered by Kuomintang special agent bandits before the liberation of Chongqing.) General Zhao Shoushan, a patriotic general of the Northwest Army who directly participated in the righteous act at that time, Yang Zilian, Secretary-General of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, democratic personage Zhang Xiangchu, Battalion Commander Song Wenmei, who was ordered to guard the Chiang Kai-shek bandit, and Jiang Longji, Deputy Director of the Education Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, all expressed their opinions at the meeting. In the speeches of people from all walks of life, they all stated that they recognized the correctness of the CPC's anti-Japanese national united front policy from the incident at that time, and expressed their willingness to continue to unite and cooperate under the leadership of the CPC and work together to build the Great Northwest.
