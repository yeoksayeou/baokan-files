Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. The Northeast region is conducting organized rotational training for district and village party member cadres and rural Communist Party members. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently issued instructions regarding this work. The instructions pointed out that: In order to make the rotational training classes achieve better results, class viewpoint, policy ideology, and communist principles education should be implemented when explaining the Party's current specific policies and analyzing and criticizing the ideological actions of party member cadres. In terms of methods, various meetings (such as party representative meetings, cadre meetings, etc.) should be appropriately divided in labor with the rotational training classes. Discussions and arrangements for current work and production should be conducted in the form of meetings; examinations of party members' thoughts and education of basic communist knowledge should be conducted in the form of rotational training classes, so as to facilitate the unfolding and deepening of ideological issues. In specific implementation, party member training classes should formulate education plans in conjunction with the actual situation of the trainees, focusing on the education of basic ideological issues in connection with the specific problems in current work and actions. This is not only practical, but also makes it easier for cadres to accept and understand. After the training is completed, the trainees should be organized to participate in or attend local party representative meetings or district and township cadre meetings, etc., which will be helpful for summarizing and arranging work or production. The instructions stipulate that the training time for party members in each county should be half a month to twenty days. The main purpose of the training class is to clarify the fairly common problems existing in the minds of current rural party members and party member cadres, such as: What exactly is urban leadership over the countryside, and worker leadership over peasants? Why is the worker-peasant alliance important? How to do a good job in production? What is the difference between the idea of getting rich through organized labor and the idea of rich peasants? Which is the direction we advocate, and what methods should be adopted to achieve this direction? What is the people's democratic dictatorship, and how to implement the people's democratic dictatorship? How to convene rural people's representative meetings? What should party members do after the victory of the People's Liberation War throughout the country? When solving the above problems, we should guide and inspire everyone to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions on these issues, and then the county party committee should appoint someone to study these issues and make one or several summary explanations on these topics to improve everyone's understanding of theoretical principles. After the summary explanation, everyone should be asked to conduct more in-depth discussions in connection with actual work in order to achieve the goal of truly clarifying their thinking.

　　东北局宣传部指示各地
　  轮训农村党员干部
    解决工农联盟、城乡关系等思想问题
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】东北各地正在进行有组织的对区村党员干部和农村共产党员的轮训工作。中共中央东北局宣传部日前特发布关于该工作的指示。指示指出：为使轮训班收到更好的效果，在讲解目前党的具体政策及分析与批评党员干部的思想行动时，应贯彻阶级观点、政策思想及共产主义的原则教育。在方法上，应该把各种会议（如党代表会、干部会等）与轮训班作适当的分工。对当前工作与生产的讨论和布置，应采取会议形式进行；对党员思想的检讨和共产主义基础知识的教育，则应采取轮训班的方式，以便利于把思想问题展开和深入。在具体进行时，党员训练班应结合受训党员的实际情况，订定教育计划，联系着当前工作和行动中的具体问题，着重基本思想问题的教育。这样既切合实际，且使干部易于接受与领会。在训练结束后，应组织受训的人员参加或列席当地召集的党代表会或区乡干部会等，这对于总结与布置工作或生产都是会有帮助的。指示规定：各县党员训练时间以半月到二十天为宜。训练班的主要目的在搞通目前农村党员和党员干部思想中相当普遍存在的问题，如：城市领导乡村、工人领导农民，到底是怎么一回事？工农联盟为什么重要？如何把生产搞好？组织起来劳动发家的思想与富农思想有何不同？何者是我们提倡的方向，应该采取那些办法来实现这一方向？什么是人民民主专政，如何实行人民民主专政？如何开农村人民代表会？人民解放战争在全国胜利了党员还该作些什么？在解决上述问题时，应引导启发大家对这些问题进行广泛深入的讨论，然后，由县委指定专人对这些问题加以研究，分题作一次或几次的总结讲解，以提高大家对理论原则的认识。在总结讲解后，再要大家联系实际工作进行更深入的座谈讨论，以达到真正搞通思想的目的。
