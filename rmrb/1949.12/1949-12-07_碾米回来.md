　　Returning from Milling Rice
    Diary of November 29th
    Wū Yān
    After helping Old Bai mill rice and returning, despite the snowy weather, beads of sweat trickled down my forehead. I was tired, but also very happy. When I carried it there in a basket, it was individual grains of millet, but what I brought back was fine rice flour. This was transformed through my own labor!
    Old Bai is our bureau chief. Because of his poor health, he has to cook for himself every day, and the rice flour is used to steam cakes. Every time I see the leaders here personally carrying water, starting fires, washing clothes, and cooking meals, I am deeply moved. The leaders are all cadres who have participated in the revolution for more than ten years, and they often tell us stories of persisting in enemy-occupied areas in Hebei during the War of Resistance Against Japan. While admiring and encouraging myself, I always think: In the present environment, which is not so difficult, these comrades should enjoy better treatment and should rest more to recover their damaged bodies. However, in their lives, they still share the joys and sorrows with us, and even do more. They said: The purpose of the revolution is naturally not to suffer hardships, but before the living standards of the broad masses of working people have been appropriately improved, we should still be thrifty. Moreover, the current life is much better than during the period of working behind enemy lines.
    In the past, I always held a dismissive attitude towards "small things" like sewing and sweeping. More than ten years of pampered life cultivated a habit of enjoying the fruits of others' labor. Later, after studying, I theoretically recognized the sacredness of labor, but rarely did anything myself. It wasn't until I joined the work this time, seeing that all the comrades were so hardworking, frugal, and simple, that I realized the seriousness of the disconnect between my theory and practice. I want to start learning from scratch.
    Yes, I have already begun to learn. Learning to sweep the floor, learning to wash dishes, learning to sew buttons. I hope I can be a diligent person who is willing to do the most troublesome tasks. Because these daily chores are unavoidable in our lives. In addition to doing my own part, I also want to do things for everyone, and I have already done so. But sometimes I also think: "Will tidying up the house delay a lot of my time? Wouldn't it be better to use this time to read books?" But I immediately thought: if I don't do it, and someone else does it, it will also delay their reading time, so I happily start doing it again. Really, I feel the greatest pleasure in labor, especially when I see the results of my own work, I feel an overwhelming joy, and I can appreciate the feelings of a farmer gazing at his pile of grain, or a worker stroking his own products.

　　碾米回来
    十一月二十九日的日记
    邬  烟
    帮着老白碾米回来，下雪的天气，额上却渗着汗珠，很累，也很欢喜。盛在箩筐里端去的时候是一粒一粒的小米，拿回来的却是细细的米粉了。这是经过自己的劳力而变成的呢！
    老白是我们底局长。因为身体不好，每天得自己做饭吃，米粉便是用来蒸糕的。我每次看见这里的首长们亲自挑水、生火、洗衣、煮饭，总受着很深的感动。首长们全是参加革命十多年的干部，时常和我们讲抗日战争中在冀中坚持敌后工作时的故事。我在钦服自勉之余，总想：在环境不是那么艰苦的现在，这些同志们应该享有比较好的待遇，应该多休息一些，使受了损伤的身体恢复起来，然而他们在生活上仍与我们同甘苦，甚至做着更多的事情。他们说：革命的目的自然不是为了吃苦，只是在广大的劳动人民的生活水平还未适当的提高以前，我们还是应该刻苦些才好。而且，目前的生活比起在敌后工作的时期已经好多了。
    我在过去，对缝补、洒扫之类的“小事”，总抱着不屑一顾的态度。十几年养尊处优的生活，养成了一种坐享其成的习惯。以后，经过学习，在理论上承认了劳动神圣，也很少动手去做。一直到这次参加工作，看到同志们全部那么刻苦耐劳，勤俭朴素，相形之下我才认识到我的理论与实践脱节的严重性，我要从头学起。
    是的，我已经开始在学了。学扫地，学洗碗筷，学缝纽扣。我希望我能是一个勤恳的，愿做最麻烦的事务的人。因为这些日常琐事，是我们生活中所不可避免的。我除了做好自己的一份外，还要做大家的事，而且我已经这样做了。但有的时候又想：“整理屋子，是不是会耽误自己的许多时间，这时间用之于阅读书籍，岂不更好么？”可是又即刻想到：若是我不做，而由别人来做，也是同样要耽误别人的阅读时间的，于是又很高兴地动手了。真的，我在劳动中感到了最大的愉快，尤其看到自己手制的成果，更有抑不住的喜欢，并可以体味到农民凝视着他底禾堆，工人抚摸自己的产品时的心情。
