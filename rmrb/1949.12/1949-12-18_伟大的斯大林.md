The greatness of Stalin is inexhaustible, and the praise of Stalin is also inexhaustible.

　　Stalin once called writers "engineers of the human soul," but in fact, world revolutionary leaders like him are truly "general engineers of human society." Just as Chairman Mao said, "The emergence of this Stalin among all mankind is a major event. With him, things are easier."

　　Molotov said in his report "On the Twenty-Eighth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution": "We are fortunate that in the difficult years of war, we had our Soviet Union's wise and experienced leader, the great Stalin, guiding the Red Army and the Soviet people forward." In fact, this is also the good fortune of all mankind. In this era when imperialism threatens world peace, we have such a wise and experienced leader, the great Stalin, guiding the people of the world forward.

　　Stalin said: "... In history, there have been some proletarian leaders who are leaders in times of storm, leaders of the practitioner type, leaders who are selfless and courageous, but theoretically weak. ...

　　"There is another type of leader, that is, a leader in times of peace, a leader who is theoretically strong, but weak in organizational work and practical work. This kind of leader only enjoys prestige among the upper strata of the proletariat, and only up to a certain point; once the revolutionary era arrives, when the actual situation requires leaders to put forward revolutionary practical slogans, the theorists withdraw from the stage and give way to emerging figures. ...

　　"In order to maintain one's position as the leader of the proletarian revolution and the proletarian party, one must possess both strong theoretical power and practical organizational work experience in the proletarian movement."

　　This is what Stalin said in his essay "Lenin as Organizer and Leader of the Russian Communist Party" written for Lenin's fiftieth birthday. He believed that Lenin was precisely "one who possessed both strong theoretical power and practical organizational work experience in the proletarian movement." In fact, this is also precisely Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause, "now the leader of the most powerful and most tempered proletarian party in the world."

　　In the history of world revolution, only in the current era of proletarian revolution have leaders like Lenin, Stalin, and our Chairman Mao emerged: on the one hand, they are practitioners, and on the other hand, they are theorists. In both theory and practice, they are "the leaders of the most powerful and most tempered proletarian party." Stalin is precisely the combination of theory and practice to an unparalleled height. What imperialism is most proud of is their atomic bomb, which is the "highest achievement" of the bourgeoisie. The pride of the proletariat is Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, which are the highest achievements of the proletariat and also the highest achievements of all mankind. (The End)

　　伟大的斯大林
    杨晦
    斯大林的伟大是说不完的，对斯大林的赞颂也是说不完的。
    斯大林曾经把作家们叫作“人类灵魂的工程师”的，其实象他这样的世界革命领袖，才真正是“人类社会的总工程师。”正象毛主席说的，“在全人类中间出了这位斯大林，这是一件大事，有了他，事情就好办了。”
    莫洛托夫在“论伟大十月社会主义革命二十八周年”的报告里说：“我们幸运的地方，就是在艰苦的战争年代有我们苏联的英明谙练领袖伟大斯大林引导红军和苏联人民前进。”其实，这也正是全人类幸运的地方，在这帝国主义威胁着全世界和平的时代，有我们这样英明谙练领袖伟大斯大林引导全世界的人民前进。
    斯大林说：“……在历史上有这样一些无产阶级领袖，这些领袖是风暴时期的领袖，实行家式的领袖，这些领袖是奋不顾身和见义勇为的，但在理论上是薄弱的。………
    “还有另外一种领袖，这就是和平时期的领袖，这种领袖在理论上是有力量的，但在组织工作和实际工作方面却是薄弱的。这种领袖只在无产阶级上层中间拥有名望，而且只是到相当时候为止；一待革命时代到来时，当实际情况要求领袖们拿出革命实践口号的时候，理论家就退出舞台，而让位给新兴人物。………
    “为要保持自己为无产阶级革命和无产阶级党的领袖地位，就须一身兼具着雄厚理论力量与无产阶级运动的实践组织工作经验。”
    这是斯大林为列宁五十寿诞而作的论文：“列宁是俄国共产党的组织者和领袖”里的话，他认为列宁正是“一身兼具有雄厚理论力量与无产阶级运动的实践组织工作经验”的，其实，这也正是斯大林，这位列宁事业的继承者，“现在是世界上最有力量的和最有锻炼的无产阶级党的领袖。”
    在世界革命史里，只有在现今无产阶级革命时代，才产生出象列宁、斯大林和我们的毛主席这样：一方面是实行家，一方面是理论家，在理论与实践两方面都是“最有力量的和最有锻炼的无产阶级党的领袖。”象斯大林正是理论与实践结合到无比的高度。帝国主义最骄傲的是他们的原子弹，这是资产阶级“最高的成就”，无产阶级的骄傲是列宁、斯大林和毛泽东，这是无产阶级的最高成就，也是全人类的最高成就。（完）
