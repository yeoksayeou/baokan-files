Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 19th: The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" and the newspaper "Ce Soir" both published news on the front page and top headlines on the 15th regarding the news that Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants fled to Vietnam to organize a "volunteer army" against the Vietnamese people.

On the same day, a commentator in L'Humanité, in an article entitled "Must Withdraw," pointed out: The war being waged in Vietnam today is "one aspect of the war waged by imperialists and their local lackeys against the entire Asian people."

The author, after recounting the statement made by PRC Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on November 29 regarding the fleeing of Kuomintang bandits to Vietnam and other places, said: The French government turned a deaf ear to this. They harbored Kuomintang elements whose ringleaders shamelessly declared that their only hope was for the Sino-French incident to spread the war throughout Asia. According to some reports, the French government will not hesitate to use Kuomintang elements to oppose the patriotic people of Vietnam.

The author concluded: As long as this criminal war of France in Vietnam exists for one day, the crisis of such provocations will exist for one day. Only by withdrawing the French expeditionary force in Vietnam and establishing normal relations with the people's China can this criminal conspiracy be defeated.

  　斥责法帝勾结白匪
  　主张撤退法军根除挑衅危机
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】法国共产党机关报“人道”报与“今晚”报，十五日均于首页头条新闻地位，登载蒋匪残部逃入越南组织反对越南人民的“志愿军”的消息。
    同日人道报评论家在以“必须撤退”为题的论文中指出：今天在越南进行着的战争，是“帝国主义者及其在本地的走卒们反对整个亚洲人民的战争的一个方面”。
    作者叙述了十一月二十九日中华人民共和国周恩来外长就国民党诸匪逃往越南等地所发表的声明之后说：法国政府对此置若罔闻，他们收容了国民党分子，这些国民党分子的头子们无耻地宣布说，他们唯一的希望是由中法事件使战争蔓延整个亚洲。根据某些消息，法国政府将不加犹豫地利用国民党分子来反对越南的爱国人民。
    作者于结语中称：只要法国在越南的这个罪恶战争存在一天，这类挑衅的危机就存在一天。只有撤退法国在越南的远征军，和人民的中国建立正常关系，才能击破这一罪恶的阴谋。
