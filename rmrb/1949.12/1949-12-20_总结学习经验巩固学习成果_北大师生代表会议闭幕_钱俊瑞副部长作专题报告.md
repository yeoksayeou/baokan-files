　　Summarize Learning Experience, Consolidate Learning Achievements
    Peking University Faculty and Student Representative Conference Concludes
    Vice Minister Qian Junrui Delivers Special Report
    [This newspaper dispatch] The National Peking University Faculty and Student Representative Conference held its opening ceremony on the 16th and triumphantly concluded on the 18th, lasting three days. Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University School Affairs Committee, explained in his opening speech that the purpose of convening this conference was to "summarize learning experiences, consolidate learning achievements, elevate learning a step further, and celebrate Peking University's 51st anniversary." Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, delivered a report at the conference entitled "Continue to Transform Our Learning." Vice Minister Qian first pointed out that the main gains in transforming learning after the liberation of Beijing were: (1) Adding and strengthening revolutionary political learning and abolishing reactionary courses. Peking University has done a good job in this regard. (2) Gradually moving towards the integration of theory and practice. (3) Initially starting to improve the theoretical and applied courses in natural sciences. For example, the fourth-year students of the Peking University School of Engineering and the School of Medicine have initially implemented streamlined courses and achieved great results. Secondly, Vice Minister Qian clearly pointed out that further transforming learning must continue to strengthen political learning, which is the focus of current curriculum reform. Courses should be rationally streamlined and leadership over teaching should be strengthened. At the same time, he mentioned the issue of equipment in teaching. Due to the state's financial difficulties, strict economy should be practiced to prevent waste. Finally, he said that the key to transforming learning is to shed ideological burdens, clearly recognize one's responsibility to the people, and advance bravely and unitedly under the guidance of correct principles. After listening to Vice Minister Qian's report, the representatives immediately started group discussions in the evening. On the 17th, at the plenary meeting, the Political Course Teaching Committee, the Academic Affairs Office, and various departments respectively gave summary reports on political course learning, business course learning, and typical experience, affirming the preliminary achievements made this semester in political course learning, business course learning, reforming and streamlining courses, improving teaching methods and content, and strengthening teacher-student relations. At the same time, they pointed out the shortcomings existing in learning and exchanged the learning experiences of various colleges and departments. All the representatives discussed these reports in groups that evening and unanimously expressed their agreement. At the plenary session on the 18th, all the representatives seriously discussed and passed four resolutions: (1) Resolution on Vice Minister Qian Junrui's report; (2) Resolution on the summary report of political course learning; (3) Resolution on the summary report of business course learning; (4) Resolution on the proposals. In the resolution on the proposals, there were nine items: strengthening administrative leadership over teaching, curriculum and teaching, political course learning, business course learning; learning planning, teacher-student relations, mass organizations guaranteeing learning, examination methods, and warm-up study movement. The conference made specific decisions on all of them. After the discussion of the proposals, all the representatives passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao in warm applause and cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao." Professor representatives of the school, Tang Yongtong, Qian Duansheng, Xiang Da, Ma Dayou, and Li Youshan, unanimously pointed out that this conference summarized the learning of this semester and resolved a series of important issues in teaching; and guaranteed to conscientiously convey and implement the resolutions of the conference. Finally, Wang Xuezhen, on behalf of the presidium, delivered a closing speech, calling on the representatives to mobilize all teachers and students of the school to implement the resolutions of the conference. All the students in the school will study the various reports and resolutions of the faculty and student representative conference during the political course discussion time this week, formulate plans in conjunction with the specific circumstances of each department and grade, and gradually implement the resolutions of the faculty and student representative conference, and further carry out new democratic learning in the school.
