　　New Scenes in Northeast China's Countryside
    Wang Gang
    The train crosses the Liaohe Plain and the main stream of the Songhua River, all the way to Heilongjiang Province, the famous granary of Northeast China. Along the way, hundreds of state-owned grain depots have commercial cadres working tirelessly day and night. Hundreds and thousands of grain carts rush to sell grain at the depots. Among the rows of grain carts are new yellow vehicles, large red-tasseled horses, and crowds of people wearing new cotton clothes, *wula* (Note), and white sheepskin coats, embellishing the new scenes of the Northeast countryside two years after the land reform.

    At the payment counter of the Hailun County grain depot, Liu Zhenzhong, a farmer from Ailu Township, Shuanglu District, talked about selling grain this year in the crowded crowd: "In previous years, the price of grain was low, and cloth, sea salt, and *wula* were very expensive. The money from selling grain was not worth much. This year, the price of grain purchased by the state is reasonable. The price of grain has risen, but other things have not. Farmers feel that everything is cheaper when they sell grain." Liu Zhenzhong's words are not without reason. After the land reform, his family was allocated six *qing* of land and harvested eighteen *shi* of grain last year. He sold four *shi* piecemeal, paid off his work debts, and bought some salt. Before spring planting, the money was used up, and the only winter clothes for his family of six were two pairs of *wula*. This year is completely different. He still farmed those six *qing* of land and harvested more than twenty *shi* of grain. He only sold two *shi* of soybeans and got three million yuan. He bought more than sixty *chi* of cloth, ten *jin* of cotton, forty *jin* of sea salt, and two pairs of *wula*. He himself has put on a brand new blue cotton coat, changed his new pants, and his wife and children have also supplemented their wardrobe. The problem of winter clothing for the whole family is solved. Liu Zhenzhong is preparing to sell a few more *shi* of grain after paying the public grain, to replace the blind horse he got during the land reform with a strong horse, or to go up the mountain to pull wood this winter, or to use it for plowing in the spring. Like Liu Zhenzhong, farmers who have undergone new changes in their economic lives are no longer isolated phenomena. A farmer in Taian County didn't even have a cotton coat when he sold grain for the first time. The second time he sold grain, he was already wearing a cotton coat. When he started delivering public grain, he was even wearing a new leather hat and new *wula*. Even Zhang Diansheng, a farmer in Xiquanling Village, Yushutai, who has always maintained a middle-peasant lifestyle, broke the old practice of growing his own cotton and weaving his own cloth, and went to the Siping grain depot to sell grain and buy Qing City cloth spun by Tianjin machines. He calculated that the price of cloth is cheap this year, and the coarse cloth he spun himself is not strong. It doesn't cost much to sell the coarse cloth and buy machine-spun cloth. In state-owned department stores across the country, it is common for farmers to buy cloth by the bolt. In October and November alone, state-owned stores in Northeast China sold one million bolts of cloth, which is equal to the total number of bolts sold by state-owned stores in 1948, exceeding the sales volume of cloth in 1947 by 40%. Other rural supplies such as kerosene, *wula*, and bean cake are also sold in large quantities. The problem of promoting decorative flowers, which often troubled department store managers in the past, has now been completely solved. In a few months, the 3,000 tons of decorative flowers stored in various places have been sold out. The automobile tires produced by the Ministry of Industry were stockpiled in the warehouses of commercial departments for several months due to poor quality, but they were very suitable for large cart tires. Since the beginning of winter, thousands of them have been bought by farmers who have added large carts.

    From Siping through Qiqihar, Bei'an to Harbin, the reporter interviewed dozens of farmers selling grain at the grain depots along the line with the same question, "Is the price of grain this year reasonable?" Their common and simple answer was: "The price of grain is good, cloth is cheap, and the Trade Bureau has not cheated the old farmers." Yes, in the past few years, although Northeast China was in a state of direct war, the national commercial organs did not neglect to raise grain prices during the grain selling season, narrow the price difference between grain and cloth, and implement a price policy to increase farmers' purchasing power. According to the state's material strength and the farmers' requirements for selling grain, the ratio of grain to cloth has been gradually reduced to increase the farmers' purchasing power. In December 1946, one ton of soybeans was equivalent to 101 *chi* of Liberation cloth. By the second half of this year, farmers could exchange the same one ton of soybeans for 374 *chi* of Liberation cloth. Compared with the ratio of one ton of soybeans to 161 *chi* of Liberation cloth the year before last and 260 *chi* of cloth last year, it has also increased a lot. With the change in the ratio of grain to cloth, knitwear, *wula*, kerosene, sea salt... all industrial products for daily use related to it have been relatively reduced in comparison with grain prices. This has become one of the important reasons for the continuous improvement of farmers' purchasing power and their increasingly improved lives in Northeast China.

    But this is only one side of the issue. When Song Wenhe, a farmer from Guangrong Township, Wuben District, Hailun County, calculated his harvest when selling grain, he felt a little confused; since the summer, Hailun County, like other counties in northern Manchuria, has been drought-stricken. He estimated that the soybeans this year could yield at most two *shi* per *qing*. The calculation after the harvest was four *shi* of soybeans per *qing*, so he felt that his estimate of this year's output was a bit conservative, and the public grain burden was not heavy. Xie Chunfang, a farmer from the same township, believed that it was not confusing to calculate in detail. Last year, there was still the Kuomintang "Second Manchuria" in Shenyang, and we had to fight, go on errands, and carry stretchers. This year, the farmers put all their energy into the fields, applied more fertilizer, and also had mutual aid teams. The state does not burden us much with public grain, so why does it seem that we are not harvesting much grain? From the conversation between these two farmers, we can see another reason for the change in farmers' economic lives. The same changes have also taken place in sideline production. In Heilongjiang Province alone, there are 3 million pigs raised, one-third of which are enough in weight and will be sold within one year, of which 300,000 are required by the state to purchase and organize for export. The province will sell 400 million eggs a year, with a total value of 350,000 tons of grain. If the state can purchase and organize the export of these items in full, it will become another factor in increasing farmers' purchasing power. This proves the correctness of the recent rural survey conducted by Heilongjiang Province: After two years of great production after the land reform, the rural areas of the province have undergone tremendous changes. The basic trend of this change is that the rural economy has begun to rise. This is reflected in the fact that 40% to 50% of the farmers in various places have reached the level of a middle peasant, of which about 10% have reached the level of a prosperous middle peasant, but there are still 40% to 50% who remain at the level of a poor peasant, and only 1% or 2% have lost their ability to cultivate or have become hired laborers for other reasons.

    These situations are often underestimated by our comrades engaged in commercial work. For example, in the first month when the state began to purchase grain, it exceeded the original plan by 80%, resulting in a shortage of funds and goods. When the manager of the Acheng Department Store was preparing white sheepskin coats for farmers, he heard that it would cost 800,000 to 1 million yuan to buy one, and he was afraid that no one would buy it, so he only prepared 100 pieces, thinking that it would be difficult to sell; but in a few days, they were bought up by the farmers who sold grain. The second time, he prepared 200 pieces, and they were sold out in a few days. As a result, 850 pieces were sold in one month; if there are more, they will continue to sell in large quantities.

    Could these scenes have been imagined in any previous period? Absolutely not! An old farmer in Shuangcheng only wore floral cotton coats made of floral cloth allocated by the Japanese in the fourteen years of the puppet Manchurian regime. He had never worn new cloth in his life, but this year he bought black market cloth from the department store and put on new cotton trousers and cotton coats. He had not been able to work for several years, but this year he went to the field every day during the threshing season, enthusiastically commented on this year's harvest, praised the fullness of the grains, and planned for next year's production at any time.

    What could be more inspiring to farmers' production enthusiasm than these vivid deeds? When they finish selling their grain and load cloth and cotton onto their carts to go home, everyone is discussing this year's prices, and then relating them to next year's production; they want to live better and step up production, they want to build the new country led by Chairman Mao better and step up production, so let's look forward to a newer scene next year!

　　东北农村的新景象
    王刚
    列车从辽河平原横跨松花江主流，直到东北著名的粮仓黑龙江省，沿线的每一个国营粮栈，有成百的商业工作干部整日不停息的工作着。上百上千辆粮车赶进粮栈卖粮，在粮车的行列里夹有黄色的新车，红缨大马，和穿着崭新棉衣、乌拉（注）、白羊皮袄的人群，点缀了土改两年后东北农村的新景象。
    在海伦县粮栈领钱处，双禄区爱禄乡的一位农民刘振中，在拥挤的人群里谈起今年卖粮来：“往年卖粮价钱落，布匹、海盐、乌拉都挺贵，卖了粮钱不顶用，今年国家买粮价钱合适，粮价涨了别的东西都没涨，卖了粮庄稼院人觉着买啥啥便宜。”刘振中讲这话不是没有原因的，土改后他全家分了六垧地、去年打了十八石粮，零零碎碎的卖了四石，去了还工帐，买点盐吃没等开春下地钱就用完了，全家六口置办的全部冬装是两只乌拉。今年就完全不同了，还是种那六垧地，打粮二十几石，只卖了两石黄豆，就得了三百万元，先后买了六十多尺布，十来斤棉花，四十斤海盐，两双乌拉，他自己已经穿上了里外三新的蓝棉袄，换了新裤面，家里老婆孩子亦添补了一下，全家冬衣问题就解决了。刘振中正准备交公粮后再卖几石粮，把土改时分的瞎马换成壮马，或今冬上山拉木头，或明春插犋都可以使上劲了。象刘振中一样，在经济生活上发生了新变化的农民已经不是个别的现象了。泰安县一个农民第一次卖粮时还没穿上棉衣，第二次卖粮，棉衣已上身，开始送公粮时连新皮帽新乌拉都穿戴齐了。就连一贯保持着中农生活的榆树台西泉岭村农民张殿生，也打破了往年自种棉花自己织布的旧例，到四平粮栈卖粮买天津机器纺的青市布，他合计着，今年布价贱，自己纺的粗布不结实，把粗布卖了买成机器纺，花钱并不多。在各地国营百货商店，农民整匹买布已很平常，在十、十一两月全东北仅国营商店卖出的布就有一百万匹，等于一九四八年国营商店全年的卖布数，超过一九四七年布匹推销量的百分之四十。农村其他用品煤油、乌拉、豆饼也同样的大量卖出。过去往往叫百货公司经理感到头痛的装花推销问题，如今已完全解决，几个月里各地储存的三千吨装花已卖得仓库空空。工业部生产的汽车轮胎，因质量不好在商业部门的仓库积压几个月，但作大车胎却很合式，入冬以来已为添置大车的农民买去几千条。
    从四平经齐齐哈尔、北安到哈尔滨，在沿线粮栈上记者以同一个问题访问过几十位卖粮的农民，“今年卖粮价钱合适吗？”他们共同的简单回答是：“粮价好，布匹贱，贸易局没叫老庄稼人吃亏。”是的，过去几年来，东北虽然在直接战争的情况下，国家商业机关却没有忽视，在卖粮季节提高粮食价格，缩小粮布差价，提高农民购买力的价格政策。按照国家物资力量和农民卖粮的要求，逐步的缩小粮布比价，来提高农民的购买力。在一九四六年十二月，一吨大豆价相当于解放布一百零一尺，到今年下半年，农民出卖同样的一吨大豆，可以换到解放布三百七十四尺了。比起前年一吨大豆换一百六十一尺解放布和去年换二百六十尺布的比例亦已提高不少。随着粮、布比价的变化，与其有连系的针织品、乌拉、煤油、海盐……一切民需日用工业品与粮价对比下，都相对的减低了。这已成为东北农民购买力不断提高，生活日趋改善的重要原因之一。
    但，这仅是问题的一面，海伦县务本区光荣乡的一位农民宋文和，卖粮时算起年成来，觉着有些糊涂；自入夏以后，海伦县和北满其他县份一样的天旱，他心里揣摸着今年的豆子最多一垧能打两石，到场后的计算是一垧地打了四石黄豆，因此觉着对今年的产量估计有些保守，公粮负担不重。同乡的卖粮农民谢春芳则认为详细的计算一下并不糊涂，去年沈阳还有国民党“二满洲”，咱们打仗要出差，抬担架，今年庄稼人把劲都使到地里去了，上粪多，又插具变工的，国家要公粮并不重，为啥打的粮不显多呢？从这两位农民的谈话里说出了农民经济生活变化的另一面原因。在副业生产中也同样的发生了变化，仅黑龙江一省就养猪三百万口，够斤秤且要在一年以内出卖的占三分之一，其中要求国家收买组织出口的有卅万口，全省一年要出卖的鸡蛋有四万万个，两项总计价值粮食卅五万吨。如国家能如数收买组织出口，又成了增加农民购买力的另一因素了。从此证明了黑龙江省最近所作农村调查的正确性：全省在土改后，经过两年的大生产，农村已经发生了极大的变化，这一变化的基本趋势是农村经济开始上升，这表现在，各地农民均已有百分之四十至五十达到了中农生活水平，其中约百分之十达到了富裕中农水平，但也还有百分之四十至五十停留在贫农的水平，只有百分之一、二失去了耕作能力或其他原因而降为雇农。
    这些情况，往往被我们搞商业工作的同志所估计不足，如国家开始购粮的第一个月里，即超过了原定计划百分之八十，发生资金及货物供不应求的现象。阿城百货公司经理当准备农民用之白羊皮袄时，一听八十万到一百万元才能买一件，恐怕没人买只准备了一百件，以为很难出售；殊不知在几天的工夫就被卖粮农民买光了，第二次又准备了二百件，同样在数天之内卖光，结果在一个月以内，共销售八百五十件；再有的话，还会陆续大量销售的。
    这些景象难道是以前任何时期所能设想的吗？决不能够！双城的一个老农，在伪满十四年的时间，只有两个冬天穿过鬼子配给的花布做的花棉袄，一辈子没有新布上过身，今年却由百货公司买回了黑市布，穿上了新的棉裤棉袄。本来他已经好几年不能干活了，今年却在打场的时候每天都下地干活，并热心地品评着今年的收成，赞扬着籽粒之饱满，并随时计划了明年的生产。
    还有什么事情能够比得上这些生动的事迹更能鼓舞农民的生产情绪呢？当着他们卖完粮食以后，把布和棉花装到车上回家的时候，大家都在议论着今年的物价，从而联系到明年的生产；他们要把生活过的更好而加紧生产，他们要把毛主席领导的新国家建设的更好而加紧生产，那么且看来年更新的景象吧！（转载东北日报）
