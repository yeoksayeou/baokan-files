　　Regular Evening Schools Established in Northeast China
　　300,000 Workers Participate in Learning
　　A Large Number of Cadres Cultivated to Participate in Enterprise Leadership
　　[By Our Newspaper] Worker education has been universally carried out in Northeast China. Up to now, 300,000 employees have received education. According to statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, in the past three years, in 21 units including state-owned and public factories, mines, and docks, 83,060 workers have participated in workers' schools and training courses, 22,437 workers have participated in night schools and literacy classes, 20,000 people have participated in technical training courses, and 522 people have been trained in literary and art training courses to serve as the backbone for carrying out factory literary and art movements. These achievements were obtained under the exceptional attention and strong leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the Federation of Trade Unions towards worker education. In the past three years, in every newly liberated area, a political enlightenment movement lasting three to five months has been universally carried out among workers, starting with large classes and training courses, conducting current affairs and policy education, and then carrying out education in historical materialism and internationalism to expose the deceptive propaganda of the reactionaries. With the strengthening of class education and the rapid development of the victorious situation, the class consciousness of the working class has been rapidly and universally raised, establishing a new attitude towards labor, actively participating in restoring transportation, protecting factories and resuming work, donating equipment and materials, production competitions, the struggle against waste, and carrying out the movement to create new records, resulting in many heroic figures such as Liu Yingyuan, Zhang Shangju, and Zhao Guoyou. In terms of cadre cultivation, tens of thousands of worker cadres have been promoted in the past three years, creating a good foundation for building people's enterprises. With the strong help of Soviet friends in Dalian and Lushun, batches of young technicians, engineers, and enterprise management personnel have emerged. The traffic company's technical school alone has trained more than 700 people in one year. Among the 48 section chiefs and above cadres of the company, 37 are from worker backgrounds, including the deputy general manager, secretary, director and deputy director of the tram factory, and the director of the trade union. With the complete liberation of Northeast China, economic construction has become the overriding central task. In February of this year, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government timely instructed all localities to systematically conduct spare-time education to improve the cultural and technical level of workers. Major cities and mining areas have successively established regular night schools focusing on culture and technology based on this instruction. In Shenyang City, 34 night schools were established in July alone. According to statistics from 78 factories in December, 337 classes including political, cultural, technical, and Russian language classes have been established, with 14,553 people participating in learning. After three months of study, illiterate people have been able to recognize two to three hundred characters and learn addition and subtraction. The level of Mandarin and arithmetic has reached the first grade of primary school, and the fourth and fifth grades have been able to write short articles of 500 characters and write short newsletters and challenge letters; technical classes have learned to read charts and make simple drawings; due to improved skills, many apprentices have been promoted to formal workers. Workers in Dalian are even more active in learning. Among the 70,000 to 80,000 employees, 36,100 people are participating in learning, including 14,600 in advanced classes and 1,100 in specialized technical classes. Xu Zhitao, a worker at the railway factory's forging workshop, became a team leader after only four months of apprenticeship and six months of study. He can now read drawings and cut materials and teach two apprentices. In the assembly plant, only three and a half people could originally assemble vehicles. The old worker Liu Changqing, because he was illiterate, used grass sticks to measure sizes. Although he knew the measurements in his heart, he couldn't teach others. After six months of study, he learned to use pen and paper to calculate and taught more than 40 people. Especially since the development of the movement to create new records, the enthusiasm of workers to learn culture and technology has become even higher. In Shenyang, many workers voluntarily contributed their labor to repair classrooms and make desks and chairs. Some run six or seven miles to study, complaining only that the time is too short and unwilling to leave after class; some workers voluntarily moved to single dormitories to facilitate joint review and discussion with everyone.

　　东北各地开办正规业余学校
　  卅万工人参加学习
    培养出大批干部参加企业领导
    【本报讯】东北各地工人教育普遍开展，截至目前为止，已有三十万职工受到教育。据东北总工会统计，仅在国、公营工厂、矿山、码头等二十一个单位中，三年来，有八三、○六○名工人参加加职工学校和训练班学习，二二、四三七名工人参加了夜校和识字班，二万人参加技术训练班学习，还有五二二人在文艺训练班里受过训练，以作开展工厂文艺运动的骨干。这些成绩是由于共产党、人民政府和总工会对于工人教育异常重视和坚强领导下获得的。三年来，在每一个新解放地区，都首先以上大课办训练班的方式，在工人中普遍开展三至五个月的政治启蒙运动，进行时事政策教育，然后即进行唯物史观和国际主义的教育，以揭穿反动派的欺骗宣传。随着阶级教育的加强和胜利形势的迅速发展，工人阶级觉悟迅速普遍提高，树立了新的劳动态度，积极参加了恢复交通、护厂复工，献纳器材、生产竞赛、反对浪费斗争、开展创造新纪录运动，出现了刘英源、张尚举、赵国有等许多英雄人物。在干部培养上，三年来，已提拔了数以万计的工人干部，为建设人民企业创造了良好基础。旅大在苏联朋友有力帮助下，更出现了成批的青年技工、技术员员与管理企业人员，只交通公司技术学校一年就训练了七百余人，该公司四十八个股长以上干部，三十七名是工人出身，包括公司副经理、秘书，电车厂正副厂长、工会主任等在内。随着东北的全部解放，经济建设已成为压倒一切的中心任务。今年二月，中共中央东北局与东北人民政府及时指示各地，要有系统的办理业余教育，提高工人文化技术水平。各主要城市与矿区，根据这一指示已先后开办了以文化技术为主的正规夜校。沈阳市在七月份一个月内，即建立三十四个夜校，至十二月据七十八个工厂统计，已建立政治、文化、技术、俄语等三三七班，有一四、五五三人参加学习。经过三个月学习，文盲已能认二、三百字、学会加减法，国语算术达到初小一年级水平，四、五年级则已能作五百字的短文，写简短通讯和挑战书；技术班学会看图表、制简单图样；由于技术提高，许多工徒升为正式工人。大连的职工，学习更是积极，在七、八万职工中，参加学习的三六、一○○人，高级一四、六○○人，专门技术班一、一○○人。铁路工厂打铁厂工友徐之涛，仅学徒四个月，经六个月的学习，当了组长，能看图下料，带个两徒弟。装配厂原只有三个半人能装车辆，老工友刘长青，因为不识字，用草棍比尺码，虽然自己心中有数，但不能教人，经过六个月学习已学会用笔算，且教会四十多人。尤其自开发创造新纪录运动以来，工人要求学习文化技术的情绪更加高涨。沈阳有许多工友自己献工修理课堂，做桌凳，有的跑六七里来学习，上课只嫌时间短，下课不愿退席；有的工人为了学习自愿搬到独身宿舍，以便和大家共同复习、讨论。
