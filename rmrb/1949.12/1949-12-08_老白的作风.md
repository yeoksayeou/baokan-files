　　Old Bai's Style
    Shu Lin
    Old Bai is the head of the Copy Editing Section of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of our Central People's Government. He is twenty-seven years old, from Weixian County, Shandong Province. He joined the revolutionary work in 1940. When I first started working at the North China People's Government this past April (when the North China People's Government was nearing its end), the first person I came into contact with was Old Bai. Upon meeting him, he gave me an impression of being honest, frank, and enthusiastic.
    We have been working together for more than seven months, and his style has deeply moved me.
    For the sake of work, he hardly distinguishes between on and off duty. He sits in the office all day, patiently completing his work of registration, distribution, proofreading, and liaison. The documents he proofreads never contain errors. When there is a rush job, he works overtime for several days in a row, usually until after midnight, and sometimes all night long. When he is too tired to keep his eyes open, he takes out his pipe, takes a couple of hard puffs, and continues to persevere.
    Due to lack of sleep and excessive labor, Old Bai fell ill. Comrades advised him to rest, but he always said that he was not sick and insisted on working. Only when he really couldn't hold on did he lie down for an hour or two.
    When there is a lot of work, he takes time out of his busy schedule to help us with copying. No matter how busy he is, he always completes his work methodically, one item at a time. He never gets emotional because of work.
    When there is an evening party, he often tries his best to let others participate, while he stays in the office.
    I remember one month when subsidies were being distributed (at that time, his monthly subsidy was twenty catties of millet). After paying off his debts, Old Bai only had a few hundred yuan left. He happily budgeted: one hundred yuan for a haircut, two hundred yuan for leaf tobacco, and the rest for pocket money.
    In order to take care of the lives of the comrades' families, the government decided to give some subsidies to those in the most difficult situations. After discussion by all the comrades, everyone unanimously agreed that Old Bai was in need of a subsidy, because only his mother, wife, and two children were left in his hometown, with a total of eight mu of land. This year, due to the severe floods in the area, life was quite difficult. However, Old Bai resolutely refused to accept it, saying that there were many comrades who needed subsidies, and he was not in too much difficulty. Since the local government might have already provided relief, he did not want to add to the burden on the people.
    In the revolutionary ranks, such comrades are very common. They serve the people wholeheartedly, constantly overcoming difficulties in arduous work, and never care about their personal living conditions.

### 老白的作风

　　老白的作风
    黍  林
    老白是我们中央人民政府政法委员会缮校股的股长，今年二十七岁，山东潍县人，一九四○年参加革命工作；今年四月间我刚到华北人民政府工作的时候（当时华北人民政府尚未结束），第一个接触的人就是老白，一见面就给了我一个印象：诚实、坦白、热情。
    我们在一起工作七个多月了，他的作风深深的感动了我。
    为了工作，他差不多是不分上班下班的，整天坐在办公室内耐心的完成他的登记、分配、校对、联络等工作；经他校过的文件，向来是不会发现错误的。突击工作时，他就接连着好几天加夜班，加班普通是要到夜间十二点以后，有时还要闹通宵；实在疲倦得眼也睁不开的时候，他就拿出烟斗来，狠狠的吸两口，仍然继续的坚持下去。
    由于睡眠不足和过度的辛劳，老白病了，同志们都劝他去休息，但是他总说自己没有病，坚持着工作；只有到实在不能支持的时候，才去躺一两个钟头。
    工作多的时候，他就在百忙中抽出时间，帮助我们缮写；不论多忙，他始终是有条不紊的一件件的去完成他的工作；从来没有因为工作闹过情绪。
    举行晚会时，他常常是尽量让旁人去参加，自己却守在办公室内。
    记得有一个月发津贴费时（那时他每月的津贴费是二十斤小米），老白除去还账只剩下几百块钱，他就高高兴兴的预算着：一百元理发，二百元买叶子烟，剩下的零用。
    为了照顾同志们家属的生活，政府决定检那最困难的给予一部分补助；经过全体同志讨论以后，大家一致认为老白是需要受补助的，因为他老家只剩下他母亲、妻子和两个小孩，一共有八亩地，今年因当地遭受了严重的水灾，生活是相当困难的；但是老白却坚决的不接受，他说需要补助的同志很多，我还不算太困难；因时地方政府可能已经救济了，我不愿再加重人民的负担。
    在革命队伍中，这样的同志是很普遍的，他们就是这样全心全意的为人民服务，在艰巨的工作中不断克服困难，从不计较个人生活的待遇。
