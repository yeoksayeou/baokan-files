　　An Improvement in Worker Education at Andong Paper Mill
  　Organizing Groups by Workshop, Combining Technology and Culture
    [Our Newspaper Despatch] The Andong Paper Mill in Liaodong Province recently improved worker education by organizing study groups according to workshop, and adopting a method that combines technical learning with cultural learning, in conjunction with the New Record Movement. Prior to this, worker education at the mill had not been successful, and two attempts to organize studies this spring both failed midway. The first failure was due to the teachers' ineffective teaching methods and inappropriate teaching materials; some used methods and content intended for elementary school students to teach workers. When the second study session was organized, although the leadership prepared teaching materials, notebooks, and pencils, established a study system, established study organizations, and hired teachers, the scheduled time was for workers to study together three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which was not suitable for the different working hours of each department; there was only one technical class per week, and the content could not take into account the needs of workers in different departments, so many workers were not interested; moreover, workers with different levels of education were in the same cultural class, which was either too shallow or too deep, so the number of people attending class decreased day by day, and it failed again.
    This improvement in learning has taken the lessons of the previous two experiences. In terms of organizational form, it adopts a decentralized but concentrated approach, with each workshop forming groups according to the nature of its work; study time is also specified differently according to work conditions. The content of the study is determined according to departments such as iron, wood, electricity, and steam. For example, the work of the materials section is cutting wood, shaving wood, steaming wood, washing wood, and selecting wood, and what the workers want is to understand the properties of wood, so they are taught the principles of wood. The content of the cultural class is also combined with technology, such as the raw materials section teaching "tree rings" on the first day, and then teaching words such as "moisture" and "fiber," on the one hand, to enable workers to recognize words such as "tree rings," and at the same time learn simple principles in practical work.
    After this improvement, the workers' enthusiasm for learning is extremely high. For example, in the raw materials section, only more than 30 people participated in the study at the beginning, but now it has reached more than 60, and many night shift workers come early to participate in the study. When the iron workshop started learning, there were less than 20 people, but now more than 40 people, almost all of them, are participating in the learning. Workers reflected: "This kind of learning is good, not only do we understand the principles, but we also learn to read." "This time, we must not fail again, the more we learn, the more motivated we are," because the learning meets the needs of the workers.

　　安东造纸厂工人教育改进
  　按照车间分编小组  技术和文化相结合
    【本报讯】辽东省安东造纸厂最近结合新纪录运动，按车间组织学习小组，采取技术学习与文化学习结合的方式，改进了工人教育。在此以前，该厂工人教育一直没有办好，今春曾两度组织学习均中途垮台。第一次失败是因教员教学不得法，教材不适当，有的拿教小学生的方法、内容去教工人。第二次组织学习时，领导上虽准备了教材、学习本、铅笔，建立了学习制度，确立了学习组织机构，聘请了教员，但规定的时间是每星期一、三、五集中工人学习三次，不适合各部门不同的工作时间；每周技术课仅有一次，内容不能兼顾各不同部门工人的需要，许多工人不感兴趣；而且文化程度不同的工人在一起上文化课，不是太浅就是太深，于是到课的人日益减少，又告垮台。
    此次改进学习，接受了上两次的教训，在组织形式上，采取分散而又集中的方式，各车间根据工作性质分编小组；学习时间亦按工作情况作不同规定。学习内容根据铁、木、电、汽等部门分定内容，如材料科工作为割木、削木、蒸木、洗木、选木等，工人所要求的为明了木材性质，于是就教木材原理。文化课的内容亦与技术结合，如原料科第一天讲“木材年轮”，以后讲“水份”，“纤维”等字，一方面使工人认识了“木材年轮”等这些字，同时学习了实际工作中的简单原理。
    这样改进之后，工人学习情绪极高。如原料科起初参加学习的仅三十余人，现已达六十余，许多夜班工人提前来参加学习。铁工室开始学习时不足二十人，现在四十余人几已全部参加学习。工人反映说：“这样学习好，不但知道了道理，而且识了字。”“这次决不能再垮台了，越学越有劲。”因为学习适合了工人的要求。
