Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th. The Chairman of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, Mao Zedong, issued a directive this month on the 5th regarding the army's participation in production and construction work in 1950. The full text is as follows:

The People's Liberation War has achieved a basic victory throughout the country. Except for a portion of the People's Liberation Army which must concentrate on pursuing and eliminating the remaining enemies on several fronts to achieve complete success, a large number of troops have entered or will soon enter a period of training and reorganization. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The army of the People's Republic of China, in peacetime and under the condition that military tasks are not hindered, should participate in agricultural and industrial production in a planned manner to help the country's construction work." This bestows upon our People's Army a glorious and significant task in addition to the great tasks of defending the national defense, consolidating public security, and strengthening training. Therefore, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission calls on the entire army to undertake a portion of production tasks, in addition to continuing to fight and perform duties, so that our People's Liberation Army is not only a national defense force, but also a production force, thereby collaborating with the people of the whole country to overcome the difficulties left over from the long-term war and accelerate the economic construction of the New Democracy.

This production task is both necessary and achievable.

This production task is necessary because the long-term war launched by reactionary forces at home and abroad against the Chinese people has caused serious disasters and severe damage to the economy. Today, if we want to carry the revolutionary war through to the end, heal the wounds left by the long-term war, and engage in various construction endeavors including economic, cultural, and national defense, the nation's income is insufficient and expenditures are huge. This is a major difficulty we face today. The method to overcome this difficulty is, first, for the people of the whole country to gradually restore and develop production under the leadership of the Central People's Government. And the People's Liberation Army must undertake a portion of the production tasks in order to overcome this difficulty together with the people of the whole country.

This production task is achievable because the vast majority of the People's Liberation Army comes from the working people, possesses a high degree of political consciousness and various production skills, and has undertaken production tasks and possesses production experience and a tradition of labor during the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The broad masses of cadres and veteran soldiers of the People's Liberation Army understand that after participating in production, the army not only overcame difficulties, reduced government expenditure, and improved the army's living standards, but also improved the army's political quality, and improved officer-soldier relations and army-people relations through labor training. This production task is achievable also because in the regions where the war has ended, the People's Liberation Army has spare time to participate in production and construction work in addition to undertaking tasks such as defending national defense, eliminating bandits, consolidating public security, and strengthening training. All of these are conditions that enable the People's Liberation Army to achieve the production task.

The People's Liberation Army's participation in production is not temporary, but should proceed from the perspective of long-term construction. The focus should be on increasing social and national wealth through labor. Therefore, the heads of all military regions must guide their subordinates to implement participation in production and construction work starting in the spring of 1950, in order to improve their own lives and save a portion of the country's expenditure. This type of production and construction work should form a movement to facilitate promotion, and this production movement should formulate longer-term plans and concrete steps. Production projects should be within the scope of agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, water conservancy, handicrafts, various construction projects, various possible industries, and transportation enterprises, subject to the permission of the People's Government, and it is forbidden to engage in commerce. The army's leading organs should conduct investigations and research based on the local conditions and make preparations this winter.

Based on past experience, the army's production movement must strictly prohibit opening shops and engaging in commercial activities. If cadres attempt to seek exorbitant profits through smuggling, hoarding, and speculation, or if such behavior is discovered, it must be promptly corrected and stopped. Because these not only violate the correct production policy and disrupt economic order, but are also bound to lead to corruption and damage to comrades, which is not permitted by law. In addition, when carrying out agricultural production, attention must be paid to avoid causing floods due to reclamation, and to avoid causing popular discontent due to land disputes.

In order to enable the army to correctly implement production tasks and carry out the production movement, the following provisions are hereby stipulated:

(1) At the division, army, and military sub-district levels and above, a production committee shall be established with the participation of representatives from the headquarters, political department, and logistics department. Its task is to grasp the direction of production, review production plans, supervise the implementation of production plans, and check illegal activities.

(2) Establish army production cooperatives and establish leading organs at all levels of the cooperative. Under the supervision and leadership of the army production committee, manage all production funds, production activities, and the handling of production results. The cooperative system and the army command system are parallel, closely linked to each other, but not confused.

(3) Implement the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, and fairly and rationally distribute production dividends, of which 40 percent should be owned by the individual producers, and the remainder should be owned by the production unit and the state, thereby establishing public and private revolutionary households, on the one hand achieving partial self-sufficiency for the army, and on the other hand allowing individual producers to gain something. This personal gain can be retained for personal use, sent home, or stored in the cooperative for future use, as decided by the individual.

(4) In areas with a shortage of land, in addition to participating in various possible handicrafts, industries, water conservancy projects, transportation enterprises, and construction projects, army leaders can consult with the local People's Government and, under the principle of voluntary participation by farmers, participate in labor, funds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, and jointly cultivate with farmers to increase yields and fairly distribute the results. However, attention must be paid to avoid compulsory implementation and avoid competing with the people for profits.

(5) The production plans of the troops in each military region must be combined with the production plans of the major administrative regions and the provincial People's Governments to coordinate production funds. All army production funds shall be regarded as investments, and interest must be calculated and repayment periods must be set. All army production enterprises must pay taxes in accordance with regulations and abide by all laws and regulations of the People's Government, and must not violate them.

The above items should be strictly observed by the heads of all military regions, so that the People's Liberation Army's production and construction work in 1950 will achieve significant results, and inspections should be carried out at any time to correct possible errors and shortcomings. Local People's Governments have the task of providing guidance and assistance to the production work of local troops.

　　中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会
    关于一九五零年军队参加生产建设工作的指示
    【新华社北京五日电】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会毛泽东主席于本月五日颁发关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示。全文如下：
    人民解放战争已在全国范围内取得基本的胜利。人民解放军除在几个战线上必须专心致志追歼残敌以竟全功外，已有大量军队进入整训，或不久即将进入整训。人民政治协商会议共同纲领中规定：“中华人民共和国的军队，在和平时期，在不妨碍军事任务的条件下，应有计划地参加农业和工业的生产，帮助国家的建设工作。”这里给了我人民军队除了保卫国防、巩固治安和加强整训这些伟大任务以外的一个光荣而巨大的任务。因此，人民革命军事委员会号召全军，除继续作战和服勤务者而外，应当负担一部分生产任务，使我人民解放军不仅是一支国防军，而且是一支生产军，借以协同全国人民克服长期战争所遗留下来的困难，加速新民主主义的经济建设。
    这一生产任务是必须而且可能实现的。
    这一生产任务之所以必须实现，是由于国内外反动派所发动的长期的反对中国人民的战争，给了人民以严重的灾害，给了经济以严重的破坏。我们今天要将革命战争进行到底，要医治长期战争遗留下来的创伤，要从事经济的文化的国防的各种建设工作，国家的收入不足，开支浩大，这就是我们今天所遇到的一项巨大困难。克服此种困难的方法，首先是全国人民在中央人民政府领导之下逐步地恢复与发展生产。而人民解放军则必须担负一部分生产任务，方能和全国人民一道共同克服此种困难。
    这一生产任务之所以可能实现，是因为人民解放军绝大多数来自劳动人民中间，有着高度的政治觉悟和各种生产技能，并曾在抗日战争最艰苦的年月，担负过生产任务，具有生产的经验与劳动的传统。人民解放军的广大的干部们和老战士们都懂得，军队在参加生产之后，不仅战胜了困难，减少了政府的开支，改善了军队的生活，并且经过劳动锻炼，还提高了军队的政治质量，改善了官兵关系和军民关系。这一生产任务之所以可能实现，还因为在战争结束了的地区，人民解放军除了担负保卫国防，肃清土匪，巩固治安，加强训练等项任务之外，已有余裕时间参加生产建设工作。所有这些，都是人民解放军能够实现生产任务的条件。
    人民解放军参加生产，不是临时的，应从长期建设的观点出发。而其重点，则在于以劳动增加社会和国家的财富。因此，各军区首长，必须指导所属，从一九五○年春季起，实行参加生产建设工作，借以改善自己的生活，并节省一部分国家的开支。此种生产建设工作，应形成一种运动，以利推广，此种生产运动应订出较长时期的计划和具体的步骤。生产项目应在人民政府允许之下，以农业、畜牧业、渔业、水利事业，手工业、各项建筑工程，各项可能从事的工业和运输事业为范围，禁止从事商业。军队领导机关应根据驻地情况，调查研究，今冬做好准备。
    根据过去的经验，军队的生产运动，必须严格禁止开商店从事商业行为。干部中如有企图以走私、囤积、投机，希图暴利的思想，或发现此种行为，必须迅速予以纠正和制止。因为这些不仅违背正确的生产方针，搅乱经济秩序，而且势必发生贪污腐化，毁坏自己同志，为法令所不容许。此外，在进行农业生产时，必须注意不要因开荒引起水患，不要因争地引起人民不满。
    为了使军队正确执行生产任务，开展生产运动，兹规定：
    （一）在师、军及军分区以上各级，成立有司令部政治部后勤部的代表参加的生产委员会，其任务为掌握生产方向，审定生产计划，监督生产计划的实施，检查违法行为。
    （二）建立军队的生产合作社，建立合作社的各级领导机关，在军队生产委员会的监督和领导之下，掌管全部生产资金，生产活动和生产结果的处理。合作社系统和军队指挥系统平行，相互密切联系，但不相混淆。
    （三）实行公私兼顾原则，公平合理地分配生产红利，其中应有百分之四十为生产者个人所有，其余为该生产单位及国家所有，借以建立公私革命家务，一方面做到军队的部分自给，一方面使生产者个人有所收获。此项个人收获，或自己留用，或寄回家用，或存储于合作社备用，由个人自己决定。
    （四）在土地缺少地区，除参加各种可能的手工业、工业、水利事业、运输事业和建筑工程之外，军队首长可和当地人民政府商量并在农民自愿原则下，参加劳力、资金、肥料、农具，与农民伙种，使之增加产量，公平分配成果。但必须注意不得强制执行，不得与民争利。
    （五）各军区部队的生产计划，须与各大行政区和各省人民政府的生产计划相结合，统筹生产资金。所有军队生产资金均作为投资，必须计算利息和订定还期。所有军队生产事业均须照章纳税，并遵守人民政府的一切法令，不得违犯。
    上述各项，望各军区首长严格注意，务使我人民解放军一九五○年的生产建设工作获得显著的成绩，并随时检查，纠正可能发生的错误和缺点。各地人民政府对当地军队的生产工作则有予以指导和协助的任务。
