　　Another Noose Tightened Around West Germany's Neck
    Izvestia Commentary

    The US High Commissioner to Germany, McCloy, and the puppet Prime Minister of the West German "Bonn Government," Adenauer, signed a bilateral "economic cooperation" agreement on December 15th for West Germany to participate in the "Marshall Plan." The Soviet newspaper Izvestia published a commentary on December 27th titled "Another Noose Tightened Around West Germany's Neck," stating: This agreement to include West Germany in the Marshall Plan is another step by American imperialism to enslave West Germany and turn it into a military springboard; at the same time, it strengthens the US position in all of West Germany at the expense of America's "allies" – Britain and France. From now on, the American "Marshall Plan" executor in West Germany will play a greater role in deciding economic policies than the high commissioners of Britain and France.

    The commentary continued, the fact that the United States is intensifying its efforts to turn West Germany into the center of a military springboard in Western Europe is also evidenced by the increased cooperation between American and German monopoly capital. The trip to the United States by German financier Abs and two directors of the Deutsche Länderbank, Vocke and Traue, is one example. According to the American Compass newspaper, the appointment of Nitze as the successor to the chairman of the US State Department Policy Planning Committee (note that Kennan, the original chairman of the committee, recently announced his resignation) can also be seen as proof of the friendship between American and German monopoly capitalists. Nitze is a representative of "Dillon, Read & Co." and has close ties with Germany.

　　加到西德颈子上的又一绳套
    消息报评论
    【新华社北京二十九日电】美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃与西德“波恩政府”傀儡总理阿登纳，于本月十五日签订西德参加“马歇尔计划”的“经济合作”双边协定。苏联消息报二十七日以“加到西德颈子上的又一绳套”为题，加以评论称：把西德列入马歇尔计划的这一协定，是美国帝国主义奴役西德和把它变成军事跳板的又一步骤；同时，也就是牺牲美国的“盟国”——英国与法国，而加强美国在全西德的地位。从今以后，美国驻西德“马歇尔计划”执行人，在决定经济政策上，将较英法两国的高级专员起更大作用。
    评论继称，美国正在加紧把西德变成西欧军事跳板的中心，也可由美德独占资本间加强合作的事实获得证明。德国金融家阿布斯和德意志州银行的两位董事福克和特劳欧的赴美之行，就是一个例子。根据美国指南针日报的意见，尼兹的继任美国国务院政策设计委员会主席（按原任该会主席的季南最近已宣布辞职），也可以作为美德独占资本家交好的证明。尼兹是“狄隆里德银公司”的代表，与德国有密切关系。
