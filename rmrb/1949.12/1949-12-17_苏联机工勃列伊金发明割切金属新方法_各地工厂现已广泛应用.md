Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: According to TASS, Breikin, a mechanic in Leningrad, has recently invented a new metal cutting method that fundamentally revises the theory of high-speed metal cutting. Breikin was the first Leningrad worker to sign a mutual assistance contract with engineers and researchers. With the help of engineers and researchers, Breikin combined his practical experience with theory, giving full play to his creative talents, and thus achieved this success. The mechanic's name is now universally respected at science and technology conferences and in research institutes training metalworking specialists. Scientific lectures are held next to the mechanic's lathe. On the lathe he operates, there are diagrams and blackboards depicting the drawings of the new cutting machine he invented for high-speed manufacturing of large steel parts. Hundreds of engineers, technicians, and enterprise managers from all over the Soviet Union come to Leningrad to listen to his lectures, which often include demonstrations of the unprecedented new cutting machine with a speed of 600 meters per minute. The audience takes away charts and samples of these cutting machines from Leningrad. Breikin's experience is now widely applied in many factories in the Soviet Union.

This mechanic is also famous for developing new model-making techniques. Model-making has long been considered a particularly difficult task, which could almost only be done by workers with genius, but Breikin has developed a new technology and designed a device that, with its help, can be used to make models with a grinding lathe instead of by hand. In this way, the models made by an ordinary worker working on a lathe are four or five times more than those made by the most experienced workers in this field. The reformer's method enriches science and dramatically changes the production of major product items.

Now, Breikin's name is printed on the cover of books published by the Leningrad Technical Book Publishing House, and the books he has written, like those written by other worker reformers, are being published and sold in large quantities, and his methods are gradually being mastered by his tens of thousands of worker partners.

　　苏联机工勃列伊金发明割切金属新方法
  　各地工厂现已广泛应用
    【新华社北京十五日电】据塔斯社讯：列宁格勒机工勃列伊金最近发明了一种新的金属割切法，这种割切法对高速度割切金属的理论进行了根本的修正。勃列伊金是第一个与工程师和研究工作者签订互助合同的列宁格勒工人。勃列伊金在工程师和研究工作者的帮助下，把他的实际经验和理论相结合，发挥了他的创造才能，因而获得了这种成绩。这位机工的名字现在科学和技术的会议上和在训练金属加工专家的研究所里普遍受到尊敬。在这位机工的车床旁边，设有科学讲座。在他所开动的车床上面有图表及黑板，在这上面描绘着他为了高速度制造大型钢制零件而新发明的割切机的图样。苏联各地成百上千的工程师、技师和企业的经理都到列宁格勒听取他的讲演，这些讲演常常是提及前所未有的每分钟走六百公尺速度的新割切机的示范。观众则自列宁格勒带走这些割切机的图表与样品。勃列伊金的经验现已广泛地应用到苏联许多工厂里。
    这位机工还以发展了新的模型制造技术而著名。模型制造很久以来曾被认为是特别困难的工作，几乎只有具有天才的工人才能做好这种工作，但勃列伊金制订了一种新技术，并设计出一种器械，靠了这种器械的帮助，就能不用手而是用磨面车床来制造模型。这样，一个平常的工人在车床上工作所制造的模型，要比在这一方面最有经验的工人多四、五倍。这位改革家的方法，丰富了科学，并急剧地改变了最主要项目产品的生产。
    现在，勃列伊金的名字已印在列宁格勒技术书籍出版所所出版的书籍的封面上，他所写的书，正和其他工人改革家所写的书一样，正在大量出版销售着，他的方法正为其成千成万的工人伙伴逐渐掌握。
