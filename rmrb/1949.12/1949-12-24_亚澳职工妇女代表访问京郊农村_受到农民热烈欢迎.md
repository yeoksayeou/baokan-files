Asian-Australasian Workers' and Women's Representatives Visit Rural Areas Near Beijing
Receive Warm Welcome from Farmers

[Beijing News] Thirteen Asian-Australasian worker representatives and Asian women representatives, including Xie Erfanka, visited Xiaohongmen, a new village in the 14th district of southern Beijing after the land reform, on the 21st of this month, and were warmly received and welcomed by the farmers of the whole village. On the morning of that day, after Chai Zemin, secretary of the Beijing Suburban Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave an introduction to the land reform situation in the suburbs at the District Office of the 14th District, they went to Xiaohongmen for a visit. Thousands of farmers lined the streets to welcome them. They first held a discussion with the work team and farmer representatives, and the head of the work team reported on the land reform situation in Xiaohongmen. Then, poor peasants and farmhands who had been allocated land and houses in the land reform excitedly told the representatives about their lives after liberation. After the symposium, Indian representative Xie Erfanka spoke to the farmers in warm applause. He congratulated the Chinese farmers on completely overthrowing the feudal rule and oppression of thousands of years. Finally, he shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" The representatives also visited the homes of farmers separately. Man Yuzhu, a farmer who had turned over a new leaf, pointed to the mule and happily told the representatives that it was obtained after the land reform. On the way back, farmers Wang Xiheng and Yang Xiushan drove a large cart and insisted on giving the representatives a ride.
