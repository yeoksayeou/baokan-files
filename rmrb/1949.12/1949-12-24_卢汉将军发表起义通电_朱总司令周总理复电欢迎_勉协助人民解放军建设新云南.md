Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd: General Lu Han, former Chairman of the Kuomintang Yunnan Provincial Government, issued the following telegram after his uprising:

To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government of Beijing, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Premier Zhou, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and please forward to the commanders, deputy commanders, and political commissars of the People's Liberation Army's field armies, all military and political committees across the country, all provincial and municipal people's governments, all provincial and municipal military control commissions for your consideration:

Since the Republic of China, the people of Yunnan have had a deep and long-held desire for the completion of the great cause of democratic and peaceful unification. The campaign to protect the nation and overthrow Yuan Shikai was long ago evident to all. During the War of Resistance, the entire strength of Yunnan's manpower and resources was contributed to the country. We elders of Yunnan originally hoped that after the victory of the War of Resistance and the restoration of our territory, China could realize peaceful unification and dedicate itself to the construction of a democratic, prosperous, and happy New China. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionary government betrayed the revolution, excluded dissidents, and in order to consolidate its bloody rule of one-party dictatorship, it did not hesitate to exhaust its military strength, abuse the people, destroy the Political Consultative Conference, and provoke a civil war. Backed by American imperialism, it plotted to eliminate the surging revolutionary forces of the people, causing our 450 million people across the country to once again fall into the abyss of misery, and the nation's vitality was almost completely destroyed. I, Lu Han, have shamefully administered Yunnan for four years, ignorant of the trend of the times, intimidated by the threat of the Chiang bandits, and failed to unite the military and civilians in a timely manner to resist tyranny. I sat idly by as tens of thousands of strong soldiers were transferred to the anti-people battlefield, and thousands of young people suffered at the hands of anti-revolutionary poison. Reflecting on myself, I feel deeply guilty. Now, as the great cause of national liberation is about to be completed, the Chiang bandits are still stubbornly persisting in their errors, exerting pressure, and attempting to withdraw their remaining forces to Yunnan, making a last-ditch struggle. The situation has reached the point of being unbearable. Therefore, after consulting with all my military and political colleagues and in response to the demands of the elders of Yunnan, I hereby announce the severance of relations with the Kuomintang reactionary government led by the Chiang bandits, the automatic liberation of all of Yunnan, and allegiance to the people's democratic camp. We will temporarily organize the Yunnan People's Provisional Military and Political Committee to maintain local order, protect public and private property, and await orders from the Central People's Government and the Revolutionary Military Commission. We sincerely welcome the People's Liberation Army to enter Yunnan as soon as possible to take over. From now on, Lu Han and others pledge to sincerely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and strive to realize the construction of a new democratic, free, peaceful, and happy New China. I hereby report this by telegram and respectfully await instructions.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai telegraphed Chairman Lu Han, who had revolted in Kunming, on the 20th of this month. The telegram reads as follows: To Chairman Lu Han:

We have read your telegram and are extremely pleased. The uprising in Kunming will help to rapidly advance the cause of liberating the Southwest and is welcomed by the people of the whole country. We hope that you will unite all military and political personnel and the people's guerrilla forces in the province to jointly maintain local order, eliminate the remaining reactionaries, and improve the relations between officers and soldiers and between the military and civilians, and strive to assist the People's Liberation Army in building a people's democratic New Yunnan.

　　卢汉将军发表起义通电
    朱总司令周总理复电欢迎
    勉协助人民解放军建设新云南
    【新华社北京二十三日电】前国民党云南省政府主席卢汉将军起义后发表通电如下：
    北京中央人民政府毛主席、朱总司令、周总理，人民革命军事委员会，并请转人民解放军各野战军司令员、副司令员、各政委，全国各军政委员会，各省市人民政府，各省市军事管制委员会公鉴：
    云南人民自民国以来，对民主和平统一大业的完成，企望夙深。护国讨袁之役，早已昭然在人耳目。抗战军兴，更举全滇人力物力贡献国家。我三迤父老，原期抗战胜利，国土光复之后，中国即可实现和平统一，致力于民主、富强、康乐的新中国之建设。不料国民党反动政府背叛革命，排斥异已，为巩固其一党独裁的血腥统治，不惜穷兵黩武，残民以逞，破坏政协，挑起内战，以美帝为后台，阴谋消灭澎湃发展中的人民革命势力，致使我全国四万万五千万人民重陷于水深火热的深渊，民族生机为摧残殆尽。汉辱主滇政，忽已四载，昧于时势之归趋，慑于蒋匪之威胁，未能及时团结军民；抵抗强暴，坐令数万健儿，被调于反人民之战场，千百青年，受难于反革命之毒手。反躬自省，负疚良多。今当全国解放大业即将完成之际，蒋匪仍执迷不悟，横施压力，妄图将其残余势力撤退来滇，作最后的困兽之门，时势至此，已属忍无可忍，爰经征询全体军政同袍的同意，顺应全滇父老的要求，即日宣布与蒋匪领导下的国民党反动政府断绝关系，全滇自动解放，归向人民民主阵营，并暂时组织云南人民临时军政委员会，维持地方秩序，保护公私财产，听候中央人民政府暨革命军事委员会命令，并竭诚欢迎解放大军早日入滇接管。今后汉等誓以至诚接受中国共产党的领导，为实现新民主主义建设民主、自由、和平、康乐的新中国而奋斗。谨此电闻，敬候指示。
    【新华社北京二十三日电】朱德总司令、周恩来总理于本月二十日电复在昆明起义的卢汉主席。电文如下：卢汉主席勋鉴：
    通电读悉，极为欣慰。昆明起义，有助于西南解放事业之迅速推进，为全国人民所欢迎。即望团结全省军政人员与人民游击部队，共同维护地方秩序，消灭反动残余，并改善官兵关系军民关系，为协助人民解放军建设人民民主的新云南而奋斗。
