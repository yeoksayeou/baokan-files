　　Northeast Region First-Level Organs
  　Complete Study of CPPCC Documents
  　Responsible Cadres Give Illuminating Reports and Answer Questions
    [Shenyang News] The study of the CPPCC documents by the first-level organs in the Northeast Region basically concluded at the end of November. Many questions were raised during the study. The most common questions can be summarized into two points: First, the nature of the people's democratic dictatorship – is it a proletarian dictatorship? How is it different from a bourgeois dictatorship? Second, the role, significance, and scope of the united front in the current historical stage. After reporting to the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, Minister Li Zhuoran gave a special report, which was widely conveyed by various organs. Many questions were resolved, which is one of the major gains of this study.
    At the beginning of the study, various organs encountered several ideological obstacles: Some veteran cadres believed that since the Common Program was the minimum program of the Chinese Communist Party, it had already been studied in previous documents, and therefore lacked in-depth research; some cadres believed that these documents had been repeatedly discussed by the CPPCC, so why did they need to be discussed by us? Still others felt that the program, organizational law, and the like were all articles and there was no theoretical debate, so they simply did not want to learn, and could not learn. These ideological obstacles, coupled with some unsuitable learning methods, made some cadres feel "dry and tasteless." The most effective method to correct these phenomena, as experience has shown, is for responsible comrades to personally give reports, providing ideological mobilization and enlightenment. For example, the faculty and staff of the Workers' Political University initially thought, "These are all articles, there is nothing to learn," but after the person in charge gave a report, everyone began to feel that there were many problems worth studying; one of the best departments in the Ministry of Commerce – Dongxing Company – also had its General Manager Zhou Kangmin give several reports and personally answer questions raised in the study, which enabled the study to be carried out.

### 东北区一级机关　政协文件学习结束　负责干部作启发报告解答问题

　　东北区一级机关
  　政协文件学习结束
  　负责干部作启发报告解答问题
    【沈阳讯】东北区一级各机关的人民政协文件学习，已于十一月底基本结束。学习中提出的问题很多，归纳起来最普遍的问题有两个：一、人民民主专政的性质—是不是无产阶级专政？与资产阶级专政有何不同？二、统一战线在现时历史阶段中的作用、意义、范围等问题。后经汇报中共中央东北局宣传部，由李卓然部长作了专题报告，并经各机关普遍传达，许多问题获得解决，这是此次学习中重大收获之一。
    在学习开始时，各机关曾碰到几种思想障碍：一部分老干部认为共同纲领既然是中国共产党的最低纲领，则早就在历来的文件中学习过了，因而缺乏深入研究；一部分干部认为这些文件经过人民政协的反复讨论，那里还需要我们来讨论呢？又一部分人则觉得纲领、组织法之类都是条文，没有什么理论性的争论，干脆不想学，学也学不进去。这些思想障碍加上一些学习方法的不适合，曾使一部分干部感到“干燥无味”纠正这些现象的方法，经验证明，最有效的是负责同志亲自作报告，作思想上的动员与启发。如工人政治大学教职员最初认为“都是条文，没啥学头”，后经负责人报告后，大家始感到问题不少，值得钻研；商业部学得最好的一个部门——东兴公司，也是由总经理周康民连作几次报告并亲自解答学习中所提出的问题才使学习开展起来。
