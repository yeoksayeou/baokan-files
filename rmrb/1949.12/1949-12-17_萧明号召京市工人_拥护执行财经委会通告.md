　　Xiao Ming Calls on Beijing Workers
    To Support and Implement the Financial and Economic Committee Circular
    [Beijing News] Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, issued a statement yesterday (16th), calling on all workers in the city to support and implement the "Handling Measures Regarding the Original Year-End Double Pay or Bonuses of Certain Publicly Owned Enterprises" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued a circular on the handling measures for the original year-end double pay or bonuses of certain publicly owned enterprises. We, the workers of Beijing, should sincerely support its spirit and measures. Because although the Chinese revolution has basically achieved a nationwide victory, next year will still be a difficult year, and the people of the whole country, especially the working class, have the obligation and responsibility to pool their efforts to overcome this difficulty. The circular points out that the original year-end double pay or bonuses were one of the results of the long-term struggle of the working class during the reactionary rule; it also points out the current financial difficulties of the state with expenditures exceeding revenues. In order to take care of the economic interests of the workers, the government, under the policy principle of taking into account both public and private interests, has decided on the three specific measures mentioned in the circular, which are very timely, reasonable, and necessary. Our Municipal Federation of Trade Unions fully supports this circular and calls on the workers of all state-owned factories in the city to thoroughly convey the spirit and measures of the circular, as well as the call made by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on this issue, and to discuss and study them, and to negotiate with the administrative side on specific implementation measures according to the specific situation of each factory. As for the issue of the original year-end double pay or bonuses for workers and staff in private enterprises, we fully agree with what the All-China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out in its call: it should also be resolved through consultation between the trade union and the capital side, based on the specific profit and loss situation of various private enterprises, adhering to the general guideline of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital.
    In addition: The Publicly Owned Industrial Workers Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also issued a notice on the same day, calling on the trade unions of various state-owned factories to explain in detail the meaning and handling measures of this circular, to conduct in-depth publicity and education among the workers, to negotiate with the administrative side to resolve various specific issues, and to report to the Publicly Owned Industrial Workers Union in a timely manner, and to implement them after reaching a consensus.

　　萧明号召京市工人
    拥护执行财经委会通告
    【北京讯】京市总工会筹委会主任萧明昨（十六）日发表谈话，号召全市工人拥护执行政务院财经委员会所发表的“关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法”。谈话原文如下：
    最近政务院财经委员会发表了关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题处理办法的通告。我们北京全市工人，对其精神与办法，应衷心拥护。因为中国革命虽然在基本上已取得了全国的胜利，但明年，仍是困难的一年，全国人民，尤其是工人阶级，有群策群力、克服这种困难的义务与责任。该项通告指出原有年终双薪或奖金是过去工人阶级在反动统治时期长期斗争的结果之一；同时又指出当前国家财政入不敷出的困难。为了照顾工人的经济利益，政府在公私兼顾的政策原则下，决定了该项通告上所说的三项具体办法，这是很及时、合理和必要的。我们市总工会对于该项通告完全拥护，并号召全市公营工厂工人，好好的传达该项通告的精神、办法以及全国总工会对此问题所发之号召，并加以讨论研究，按各厂具体情况，与行政方面协商出具体执行办法。至于私营企业中工人职员们的原有年终双薪或奖金问题，我们完全同意全国总工会在该项号召中所指出的：也应当经过工会，根据各种私营企业盈亏的具体情况，本着发展生产、劳资两利的总方针，与资方进行协商解决。
    又：市总工会筹委会公营产业工人工作委员会也于同日发出通知，号召各公营工厂工会，详细讲解这个通告的意义与处理办法，在工人中进行深入的宣传教育，与行政方面协商解决各项具体问题，并应及时报告公营产业工会，在取得一致意见后再执行。
