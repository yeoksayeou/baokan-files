　　The great October Socialist Revolution ended the system of exploitation of man by man in Russia. The working class, closely linked with the peasantry, took the power of the state into its own hands. For the first time in history, the working people became the masters of the land, forests, rivers, workshops, factories, mines, railways, and banks. Under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin, a brand-new socialist system was successfully established here. There are no exploiters here. All the means and materials of production, along with the entire product of the laboring people, belong to the people themselves.

　　Work is no longer a lowly chore; it has become a glorious responsibility to society, a respectable, honorable, courageous, and heroic act. Free, creative labor has given rise to socialist competition and the Stakhanovite movement. Socialist competition has truly spread throughout the country, involving more than ninety percent of workers, engineers, technicians, civil servants, and tens of thousands of collective farm men and women. Soviet workers feel that they are powerful contributors to social life and creators of history.

　　The socialist state provides unlimited opportunities for the development of national productive forces, the improvement of the cultural standards of the broad masses of the people, and the expression of genius, which, according to Lenin, is "a spring in the people that has not been relaxed, which capitalism has exhausted every means to destroy, suppress, and suffocate."

　　The reform methods of men and women advancing in the production sector are being rapidly disseminated at an astonishing rate. Newspapers have reported these news: Nikolai Rossiisky, a foreman at the Moscow "Kalibr Factory," once organized collective "Stakhanovite" work, so in addition to "Stakhanovite" teams, "Stakhanovite" zones and "Stakhanovite" stores began to appear in factories throughout the country. Pokhvistnev, a lathe operator in Leningrad, invented a method of high-speed metal sawing. This method was immediately adopted by "Stakhanovite" activists in hundreds of factories. Alexander Chutkikh, a deputy foreman at the Krasnokholmsky Worsted Mill, organized a "first-class quality team" solely for the production of first-class fabrics. This idea was immediately adopted by textile workers, tailors, machine manufacturers, and workers in other industrial sectors. The Soviet government attached great importance to the inventions of Rossiisky, Pokhvistnev, and Chutkikh, and therefore awarded them Stalin Prizes.

　　Workers' inventions and suggestions for improving production are being widely carried out in the Soviet Union and have become a regular movement. The achievements of the reformers are being studied by academies of sciences, factory laboratories, engineers, and technicians. Their advanced methods are being universally adopted throughout the country.

　　The collective farm system, the extensive mechanization of agriculture, and the application of the latest inventions of Soviet science have given farmers a new, socialist attitude toward work. The number of reformers in collective farms is increasing day by day. Under the leadership of the Michurin Academy, they are cultivating new varieties of grain, achieving unprecedented harvests, developing highly productive livestock breeding, and extending the planting of southern plants to the north.

　　Tens of thousands of workers and collective farmers, while continuing to work, are also studying various subjects in technical schools or higher education schools. The cultural and technical standards of the general working masses are gradually improving. The boundary between mental and manual labor has been greatly reduced.

　　A socialist principle is being implemented in the Soviet Union, namely: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work." The higher the productivity of labor of the Soviet people and the greater their contribution to social labor, the more generous the remuneration they receive. Workers who exceed production quotas can also receive bonuses.

　　In the Soviet Union, every sincere worker is valued and respected, and there are countless men and women advancing in factories and collective farms. Articles about them are often published in the country's leading newspapers. Their photographs adorn the walls of clubs and cultural palaces. Tens of thousands of workers, engineers, civil servants, collective farm members, scientists, doctors, teachers—people of all professions—have been given awards and medals by the Soviet government. Thousands of workers and collective farm members have been awarded the honorary title of "Hero of Socialist Labor." For special inventions and thorough reforms in production methods, the Soviet government has awarded Stalin Prizes to 3,121 people, including workers, foremen, and men and women from collective farms. The Stalin Prizes include monetary awards ranging from 500,000 to 1,500,000 rubles.

　　The socialist planned economic system eliminates the possibility of crises. Unemployment disappeared in the Soviet Union long ago, guaranteeing the right to work for all. Social insurance is universal for all workers and staff, and the insurance premiums are borne by the state. Every employee can receive allowances during illness, and can receive pensions when they lose their ability to work or are old. The insurance fund is managed and controlled by the trade union. In the Soviet Union, every employee has an annual vacation, ranging from two weeks to a month, during which they continue to receive their salary as usual. Medical subsidies are also available to everyone.

　　The labor legislation of the Soviet Union is the most progressive and democratic. The working day is limited to eight hours, and some business departments only have seven hours, or even six hours. Soviet women receive equal pay when their work is equal to that of men. The state constantly strives to reduce work to a minimum, and strenuous manual labor is widely replaced by machines and automated machinery. Labor hygiene and strict attention to safety regulations are enforced by law.

　　The Soviet Union is gradually eliminating the wounds caused by the Second World War. In terms of industrial standards, last year has exceeded 18% of the pre-war 1940. This year especially is progressing by leaps and bounds. Grain production is higher than before the war. The main part of the problem of grain production has been solved. At the same time, a solid foundation has been established in order to achieve greater achievements in this area. Prices in state-owned and cooperative stores and collective farm markets are gradually falling. Last year alone, wages and salaries have more than doubled.

　　The Soviet people are being inspired by this ideal, that is, they are building a communist society, and their work is for the higher prosperity of the country, and the interests of the country are consistent with the interests of all the people.

　　向共产主义社会迈进的苏联
    （周惠竹译）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，结束了在俄罗斯人剥削人的制度。工人阶级与农民密切地联系起来，把国家的政权拿到了自己的手中。在历史上劳动人民第一次成为国土、森林、河流、作坊、工厂、矿产、铁道与银行的主人。在列宁和斯大林党的领导之下，这里成功地产生了崭新的社会主义制度。这里没有剥削者。所有的生产工具与器材，连同劳动人民的全部生产品，都是属于人民自己的。
    工作已经不是卑贱的苦差了；而是成为对于社会的光荣责任，是一件可敬的、光荣的、勇敢的、英雄的行为。自由的、创造性的劳动，产生了社会主义的竞赛和斯塔哈诺夫运动。社会主义的竞赛，已真正的遍于全国拥有百分之九十以上的工人、工程师、技术员、公务员，和成千成万集体农场的男女。苏维埃的工人，感觉到自己是社会生活的有力的贡献者，是历史的创造者。
    社会主义国家，把无限的机会给予了国家生产力的发展，广大人民文化水准的提高，和天才的表现，这在列宁说来，就是“在人民中，未被放松的弹簧，它是被资本主义用尽千方百计来摧残、压抑和窒息的。”
    在生产部门中前进的男女们的改革方法以惊人的速度被很快的传播着。新闻纸曾经报道过这些消息：尼科拉罗西斯基，莫斯科“卡立蒲工厂”的工头，曾经组织过集体“斯塔哈诺夫”工作，于是除了“斯塔哈诺夫”小组外，“斯塔哈诺夫”区城，和“斯塔哈诺夫”商店，开始出现于全国工厂的各处。波克维区，列宁格勒的镟盘工，发明了高速锯切金属的方法。这个方法立即被成百工厂中的“斯塔哈诺夫”运动者所采用。亚力山大却基克，克拉斯诺克姆斯基毛丝厂的副工头，组织了一个“第一级质量小组”，仅仅是为了生产头等织物的。这种想法立即被织物工人、成衣匠、机器制造者、及其他工业部门的工人所采用了。苏维埃政府对于罗西斯基、波克维区、和却基克的发明，是异常重视的，因此赠予了他们斯大林奖品。
    工人们对于改良生产的发明和建议，在苏联广泛的进行着，已经成为一种经常的运动了。改革者的成就，被科学院、工厂实验室、工程师和技术家们在研究着。他们的进步方法是被全国普遍采用着的。
    集体农场制度，农业的广泛机械化，和苏维埃科学最新发明的应用，使农民对于工作，有了新的、社会主义的态度。集体农场中改革者的数目，一天一天的增加。被米邱林科学院领导着，他们培植着谷物的新变种，得到了前所未有的收获，发展了高度生产繁殖的牲畜，向北推广了南方植物的种植。
    成千成万的工人和集体农人，当他们继续工作的时候，一面还在技术学校或高等教育学校里，研读各种功课。普通工人群众的文化和技术水准，在逐渐提高着。劳心和劳力的界限，已经消除很多了。
    一个社会主义的原则在苏联实行着，即是：“各尽所能，各取所值”。苏维埃人民工作的生产力愈高，其对社会劳动的功能也愈大，他所得到的报酬也就愈优厚。超额生产的工人，还可以得到红利。
    在苏联，每个诚朴的工人，是受到重视与尊敬的，工厂和集体农场里，有着无数前进的男女。关于他们的文章，常登载于国内第一流的报纸上面。他们的照片，装饰着俱乐部和文化宫的墙壁。成千成万的工人、工程师、公务员、集体农庄庄员、科学家、医生、教师——任何职业的人民，曾经被苏维埃政府给过奖状和奖章。成千的工人和集体农庄庄员，得到过“社会主义劳动英雄”的尊称。为了生产方法的特别发明和彻底改革，苏维埃政府曾以斯大林奖品给予了三、一二一人；他们之中有工人、工头、和集体农场的男人与妇女。斯大林奖品里包括了从五十万到一百五十万卢布的金钱奖。
    社会主义的计划经济制度，消除了危机发生的可能。很久以前，失业便在苏联消失了。保证了所有人的工作权利。社会保险普及于所有的工人和职员，而保险费是由国家负担的。每个工作人员，生病期内可以领到津巾，失去工作能力，或年纪老大的时候，可以领到恤金。保险基金是由职工会管理和支配的，在苏联，每个工作人员都有年假，期限是从两星期到一个月，假期内仍旧照常拿薪。医药补助金也是所有的人都可以得到的。
    苏维埃联邦的劳工立法，是最进步的，也是最民主的。每天限定工作八小时，有些企业部门只有七小时，甚至六小时。苏维埃妇女的工作与男人相等时，可以得到同等的工资。国家经常设法将工作减轻至最低限度，辛苦的人力劳动，广泛的被机器和自动机械代替着。劳工卫生和严密注意安全的规章，是法律所强制执行的。
    第二次世界大战所造成的创伤，苏维埃联邦正在逐渐的消除着。就工业水准而论，去年已较战前的一九四○年超过了百分之十八。而今年尤其在大踏步的前进着。谷物产额较战前为高。谷类生产问题的主要部分，业已解决。同时，为了在这方面能够取得更巨大的成就，稳固的基础已经建立起来。国营与合作商店内，集体农场的市面上，价格在逐渐的下落着。仅仅去年，工资和薪金就增加了两倍多。
    苏维埃人民正被这个理想所鼓舞着。即是，他们是在建设一个共产主义社会，他们的工作是为了国家更高度的繁荣，而国家的利益与全体人民的利益是一致的。
