Rising Foreign Prices, Foreign Exchange Adjustment
　　Casing Industry Actively Transforming

[Our Newspaper] Casings, one of our country's important export goods, has seen improved export business recently due to repeated price increases in foreign markets, coupled with the government's recent appropriate adjustment of foreign exchange rates. Domestic prices of casings in North China have risen since late last month due to supply and demand. As of December 10th, pig and sheep casings have risen by 500 to 1,000 yuan per piece. Because exports are now more profitable than before, the daily volume of goods arriving and the volume of transactions are both high. The restoration and improvement of the casing industry in Shanghai exceeds any other industry. Up to now, in addition to the original fourteen factories that have all resumed operation, two new ones have been added. In terms of output, reliable statistics for sheep casings are not yet available, but pig casings have reached 60% of the highest annual output in the past. The industry has great prospects for development because the supply of raw materials is not a problem at all, and the demand in foreign markets is also very urgent. Generally speaking, the current export situation is already very normal. However, although exports are currently profitable, domestic manufacturing costs still need to be reduced.

　　国外价升·外汇调整
  　肠衣业转形活跃
    【本报讯】向为我国重要出口物资之一的肠衣，近来由于国外市场价格一再上提，且加以政府于最近适当调整外汇后，该业出口业务已日见好转。华北肠衣国内价格自上月下旬起因供求关系上提后，至本月十日，猪羊肠衣每根已上涨五百到一千元不等。由于目前出口已较前有利，故每日上货量和成交量均多。上海市肠衣工业，目前恢复好转的情形超过其他任何一业。到现在为止，除原来十四家工厂已经全部开工复业外，还新添了两家。出品方面，羊肠部部份尚无可靠统计，猪肠部份已到达过去最高产量每年的百分之六十。该业因原料供应根本不成问题，且国外市场需要亦甚迫切，故发展前途甚大。即就目前出口情况来说，一般已很正常。但目前出口虽已有利可图，但国内制造成本尚待设法减低。
