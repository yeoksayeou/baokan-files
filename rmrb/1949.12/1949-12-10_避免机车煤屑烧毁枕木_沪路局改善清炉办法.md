　　Avoiding Locomotive Cinders Burning Ties
  　Shanghai Railway Bureau Improves Slag Cleaning Methods
    [Our Shanghai Dispatch] During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the Ninghu and Huhang Railways never paid attention to track maintenance. Locomotive cinders often fell, causing ties to burn. Whether the crew was driving the locomotive or stopping at the station, they arbitrarily cleared the slag, which not only burned the ties but also damaged the cleanliness of the station. To completely eliminate the bad habits left over from the Kuomintang reactionary management of railways, the Shanghai Railway Administration has formulated preventive measures. The crew members have discussed these measures to earnestly correct the following points: (1) The factory and section repair departments of the bureau will guarantee the repair of all slag boxes, ash door bottoms, ventilation doors, and water spray devices of all operating locomotives. (2) If the crew must clear slag en route, they should first close all the doors of the slag box and spray water thoroughly before clearing. (3) All locomotive slag cleaning work, whether within the factory section area or within the station boundary, must be carried out in places with ash ditches. In addition, in areas within the station boundary where ash ditches have not been set up but locomotives must frequently carry out slag cleaning work, the bureau has uniformly installed or laid fireproof materials such as iron plates, so that the people's railway property will not suffer any losses and the station appearance will not be affected.

　　避免机车煤屑烧毁枕木
  　沪路局改善清炉办法
    【本报上海专讯】宁沪、沪杭两铁路，过去在国民党反动派统治时期，对于养路工作，从未加以注意，机车行驶时，常有煤屑落下，发生烧坏枕木情事。乘务员无论在机车行驶或在站停留时，随意清除炉灰，不但烧毁枕木，且有损站容之整洁，上海铁路管理局，为彻底消灭国民党反动派管理铁路时所遗留下的恶习，特订定防止办法，并由乘务员展开讨论，切实注意纠正下列各点：（一）所有各运用机车之炉灰箱，灰底门，通风门及撒水装置等，由该局厂段检修部门保证修好，（二）乘务员如在途中必须清除炉灰时，应先将炉灰箱各门一律关好，并充分撒水始可清除，（三）无论在厂段范围或车站站界以内，所有机车之清炉工作，必须择有灰沟处办理。此外，在站界以内，尚有未设灰沟之处，而机车必须经常在该地点办理清炉工作者，该局已一律加以设置或铺设铁板等防火物。不使人民铁路财产稍有损失及站容蒙受影响。
