　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. The guerrilla warfare in various parts of Malaya is continuing to develop. According to the Straits Times, which has close ties with the Singapore colonial government, in just one week, from October 19th to 25th, Malayan guerrillas carried out eight attacks on British armed transport teams, barracks, and police stations. According to the newspaper's Kuala Lumpur dispatch: When guerrillas attacked a Gurkha base in the Jerib District of Negeri Sembilan on October 21st, the battle lasted for seventy minutes. According to the newspaper's Ipoh dispatch: When guerrillas attacked the police station nine miles northeast of Ipoh on the morning of October 19th, they rescued eighty-five Sakai people who were detained by the British in the concentration camp there, of whom eighty-two joined the guerrillas. These Sakai people were originally part of the Malayan aborigines living in the mountains. The Malayan colonial authorities, fearing that they would assist the guerrillas, concentrated them in February this year. This fact proves that all ethnic groups in Malaya are increasingly uniting and actively participating in the just war of the Malayan people for independence, democracy, and freedom.
    According to a late dispatch from Malaya, the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army issued a declaration on February 1st this year, formally announcing the establishment of the Malayan National Liberation Army to uniformly lead the various dispersed people's armed forces. The declaration first condemned the British imperialism for launching a criminal war of massacre against the people in Malaya. The declaration continued that the Malayan people would rather die than submit. In order to defend the interests and rights of the people, the Malayan people launched a nationwide national revolutionary war against British imperialism, fighting to expel British imperialism, strive for national liberation, people's democracy, a happy life, and economic prosperity. The general purpose of the Liberation Army's combat is to realize the MCP's "People's Democratic Republic Program," which represents the basic demands of all people of all ethnic groups and classes at this stage. The declaration pointed out that the National Liberation Army has developed into nine detachments, which are generally active in various states throughout Malaya. The First Detachment of the Liberation Army is in Selangor, the Second Detachment is in Negeri Sembilan, the Third Detachment is in northern Johor and Malacca, the Fourth Detachment is in southern Johor and Singapore, the Fifth Detachment is in Perak, the Sixth Detachment is in western Pahang and Kelantan, the Seventh Detachment is in eastern Pahang and Terengganu, the Eighth Detachment is in Kedah and Penang, and the Ninth Detachment is in central Johor. The declaration finally called on the people of all classes to unite widely, form a national united front against British imperialism, and persist in the national liberation war to the end.

　　马来亚游击战继续扩展
  　成立解放军统一领导人民武装
    马共号召各阶层人民加强团结
    【新华社北京十日电】马来亚各地的游击战争仍在继续发展中。据与新加坡殖民地政府有密切关系的海峡时报星期刊刊载，仅从十月十九日至二十五日的一星期中，马来亚游击队对英国的武装运输队、兵营和警察所就进行了八次袭击。据该报吉隆坡消息：游击队于十月二十一日袭击森美兰吉里布区某一个廓尔卡部队的基地时，战斗曾继续了七十分钟。又据该报怡保消息：游击队于十月十九日晨袭击怡保东北九哩的警察所时，曾救出了被英国人关在该地集中营中的八十五个沙盖人，其中有八十二人参加了游击队。这些沙盖人原来是住在山中的马来亚土著的一部分，马来亚殖民当局害怕他们援助游击队而于今年二月间把他们集中起来。这一事实证明马来亚各民族正日益团结起来，积极参加马来亚人民争取独立、民主、自由的正义战争。
    另据马来亚迟到消息，马来亚共产党中央委员会和马来亚民族解放军总司令部曾于今年二月一日发表宣言，正式宣告马来亚民族解放军的成立，以统一领导各个分散的人民武装。该宣言首先斥责英帝国主义在马来亚发动的屠杀人民的罪恶战争。宣言继称，马来亚人民是宁死不屈的，为了保卫人民的利益和权利，马来亚人民发动了全马规模的，反对英帝国主义的民族革命战争，为驱逐英帝国主义、争取民族解放、人民民主、生活幸福和经济繁荣而奋斗。解放军战斗的总目的，在于实现马共的“人民民主共和国纲领”，这一纲领代表着现阶段各民族各阶级全体人民的基本要求。宣言指出：民族解放军已发展到九个支队，他们普遍活动于全马来亚的各个州。解放军第一支队在雪兰莪，第二支队在森美兰，第三支队在柔佛北部和麻六甲，第四支队在柔佛南部和新加坡，第五支队在霹雳，第六支队在彭亨西部和吉连丹，第七支队在彭亨东部和丁加奴，第八支了在吉打、槟城，第九支队在柔佛中部。宣言最后号召各阶级人民广泛地团结起来，结成反对英国帝国主义的民族统一战线，坚持民族解放战争到底。
