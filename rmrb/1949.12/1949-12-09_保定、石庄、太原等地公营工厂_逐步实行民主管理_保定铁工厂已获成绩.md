　　Public Factories in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Other Places
  　Gradually Implement Democratic Management
    Baoding Iron Factory Has Achieved Results
    [This newspaper reports] Combined reports: Public factories in cities such as Baoding, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang have been gradually implementing the democratization of factory management, adhering to the principle of relying on the working class. The Baoding State-owned Iron Factory has implemented democratic management and has already achieved results. When the factory was converted from an ordnance factory to an iron factory after liberation, its production development was greatly limited due to unfamiliarity with production technology and problems with business management. This spring, when the factory contracted to build two wooden bridges, the Caohe and Baoding Xiaoximen bridges, they lost more than 10,000 jin of millet because the technicians were unfamiliar with the technology and made mistakes in the design. There was also a bureaucratic style in management. In May, when the Water Conservancy Promotion Society hired carts to pull waterwheels to the factory, the carts returned because the factory was closed for the weekend. In terms of personnel standards, the emphasis was not on business ability and labor skills, but there was a bias towards politics and a neglect of technology, which failed to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm for production. Because the workers were unaware of the overall operating conditions of the factory, they were unable to put forward specific suggestions for improvement. Therefore, although workers participated in the factory management committee, it was only a formality. In June, with the help of the Party and the government, an in-depth inspection was carried out, and some serious problems were found. The leadership then resolved to thoroughly rely on the working class and realize true democratic management. First, it reported all operating conditions to the workers in the factory and mobilized the workers to study how to run the factory. At this point, the workers put forward suggestions for building the factory. After everyone's research, it was decided to adopt the policy of "strengthening technology, improving quality, changing business methods, and serving agriculture." After this reform, the factory gradually became active, and the production efficiency of the workers was greatly improved. Worker Gao Wenzhi invented the use of a buckle machine to make car axles, increasing production efficiency by twelve times, and worker Cui Henian improved the output by one time after modifying the leaky tray. The workers also automatically increased working hours. In terms of business methods, a policy of small profits and quick sales was adopted; in terms of production management, a system of responsibility at each level was implemented. Now the factory has been completely renewed, and the number of workers has doubled.
    On the basis of further implementing democratic management, various public factories in Shijiazhuang have successively launched the third production campaign. At the beginning of the competition, the factory branches, administration, trade unions, and Communist Youth League all made democratic mobilizations, and discussed production plans and competition conditions from top to bottom. All the employees of the Yumin Flour Mill formulated five reward methods, with the production team as the unit, evaluated every half month, and the winners inserted red flags. Taiyuan Tobacco Company has also begun to experiment with democratic management, and is now carrying out publicity and education to brew discussions and other work. In the discussions and deliberations of the various groups, some incorrect ideas on democratic management have now been discovered, such as some workers believe that regardless of whether it is democratic or not, just produce well and get paid, and some think that democracy is good, the staff spends less effort, and does not offend people, and earns millet. In order to smoothly realize the democratic management of the factory, the local factory leadership is paying attention to overcoming these erroneous ideological tendencies.

　　保定、石庄、太原等地公营工厂
  　逐步实行民主管理
    保定铁工厂已获成绩
    【本报讯】综合报导：保定、太原、石家庄等市公营工厂，贯彻依靠工人阶级方针已逐步实行了工厂管理民主化。保定国营铁工厂实行民主管理化并已获得成绩。该厂解放后刚由兵工业改为铁工厂时，由于生产技术不熟练、经营管理工作有问题，在发展生产上受到很大限制。今年春天该厂包制漕河和保定小西门两座木桥，因技师技术不熟练设计错了，赔了一万多斤小米。在经营上也存在着机关化习气，五月间水利推进社雇大车到该厂拉水车，因该厂过礼拜不办公使大车返回。在用人标准上，不是以经营能力、劳动技术为标准，存在着重政治轻技术的偏向，不能发挥大家的生产积极性。工人因对工厂整个经营情况不明，亦未能提出具体改进意见，因而虽有工人参加工厂管理委员会亦仅具形式。六月里在党和政府帮助下，进行了深入的检查，发现了严重存在的一些问题，领导上才下决心，彻底依靠工人阶级，实现真正的民主管理，首先向全厂工人报告了全部经营情况，发动工人研究工厂如何办？至此工人才纷纷提出建厂意见，经大家研究后决定出“加强技术、提高质量、改变经营方法、为农业服务”的方针。经此次改革后，工厂逐步活跃起来，工人生产效率亦大为提高。工人高文治发明用压扣机做车子轴，提高生产效率十二倍，工人崔鹤年改选漏盘后，产量提高一倍。工人们并自动增加工时。在经营方法上采取了薄利广销的方针；生产管理上实行逐级负责制。现该厂面貌已焕然一新，工人增加了一倍。
    石家庄各公营工厂在进一步贯彻民主管理的基础上先后开展了第三次生产运动。在竞赛开始，各厂支部、行政、工会、青年团都作了民主动员，并由上而下的讨论了生产计划和竞赛条件。裕民面粉厂全体职工，制订了五条奖励办法，以生产小组为单位，每半月评判一次，优胜者插红旗。太原烟草公司也开始实验管理民主化，现正进行宣传教育酝酿讨论等工作。在各小组的酝酿讨论中，现已发现若干对民主管理的不正确思想，如有的工人认为不管民主不民主，只要好好生产得到工资就行，有的认为民主是不错，职员少费心力，又不得罪人，赚了小米就算了。为了顺利实现工厂的民主管理，当地工厂领导上正注意克服这些错误的思想倾向。
