Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st: According to TASS, London: British workers are resolutely rejecting the call by right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to halt wage increase demands. Since the pound's devaluation, prices have risen rapidly, and five million workers have already requested wage increases. However, the TUC's right-wing leaders, who support the Labour government's wage freeze policy, issued a call to halt wage increase demands after a meeting with Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Minister of Labour Isaacs in mid-November. The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, representing three million workers (about one-third of the TUC's total membership), has rejected this policy of suppressing workers' interests to expand capitalist profits and has decided to strive for a weekly wage increase of one pound. They pointed out: "There are sufficient profits in the machine industry to meet the workers' one-pound demand without increasing the price of finished products." Meanwhile, the National Union of Mineworkers is convening meetings to consider making the same demand.

Moreover, Scottish workers are resolutely protesting the British TUC's ban on Communists participating in trade union work. The reactionary resolution passed by the 81st British TUC Congress in early September, led by Lawther and Deakin, to expel progressives from trade unions, has already aroused widespread dissatisfaction among British workers. Recently, the Transport and General Workers' Union branches in Scotland established a special committee to protest the TUC's right-wing leadership's ban on Communists holding positions in trade unions. The committee's secretary, Thomas Cowan, a non-Communist, told a Workers' Daily reporter that in Glasgow alone, thirteen out of nineteen branches have announced their opposition to the ban. One branch elected ten Communists to various positions. Another branch re-elected its Communist chairman and secretary to continue in office. Cowan said: "We want democracy within the trade unions."

　　英镑贬值后物价迅速上涨
  　英各地工人要求增资
    职工大会右派分子阻挠失败
    【新华社北京一日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工人坚决拒绝职工大会右翼领袖停止增资要求的号召。自英镑贬值后，物价迅速上涨，工人提出增资要求者已达五百万人。但是支持工党政府冻结工资政策的职工大会右翼领袖，则于上月中旬与财相克里浦斯、外相贝文及劳工大臣伊萨克举行会议后，发出停止增资要求的号召。拥有三百万工人（约占职工大会会员总数的三分之一）的造船与机器工会联合会，已经拒绝这种打击工人意图扩大资本家利润的政策，决定力争每周增资一镑的要求。他们指出：“在机器工业中有着足够的利润，可以不增加成品的价格而满足工人的一镑要求。”同时，矿工工人全国联合会已在召集会议，考虑提出同样的要求。
    又讯：苏格兰工人坚决抗议英职工大会不许共产党人参加工会工作的禁令。今年九月上旬，英职工大会第八十一届大会，在以劳瑟和狄通过的驱逐进步分子出职工会的反动决议，已经引起英国工人的广泛不满。最近运输及各业工人工会在苏格兰的分会成立了特别委员会，对职工大会右翼领导集团不许共产党人在工会中据有职位的禁令，进行抗议运动。该委员会书记非共产党员多马斯·科万告工人日报记者称：单在格拉斯哥一地十九个分会中，已有十三个宣布反对该项禁令。有一个分会推举了十名共产党人担任各种职位。另一分会重新选举了共产党员的主席和书记继续任职。科万说：“我们在工会内要民主”。
