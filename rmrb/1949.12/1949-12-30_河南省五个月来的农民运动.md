　　Peasant Movement in Henan Province Over the Past Five Months
    Qu Yifan
  　(I) Overview of the Movement in the Province
    The large-scale peasant movement in Henan Province was launched on the basis of suppressing the Kuomintang remnants who roamed the countryside. In July of this year, all parts of the province first launched a province-wide campaign to suppress bandits. With the victory of the bandit suppression, Henan promptly shifted to mobilizing peasants to thoroughly eliminate bandits and, in conjunction with the bandit suppression, launched a struggle against reactionary feudal despots in the countryside. In areas where scattered bandits have been largely eliminated, the peasant movement focuses on the struggle against despots, vigorously mobilizing and organizing peasants. The anti-despot movement, or rural democratic movement, is a struggle by peasants against the most ferocious feudal rulers in the reactionary countryside—the despotic landlords—settling their brutal crimes of oppression, massacre, extortion, and plunder against the peasants. As of the end of October, 52 counties (out of a total of 85 counties in the province), more than 270 districts, and more than 12 million peasants throughout Henan Province have been involved in the vigorous anti-despot movement. Among them, the anti-despot struggle by peasants in areas such as Jiaxian, Baofeng, and Linru in the Xuchang area, Yiyang and Luoyang in the Luoyang area, and Zhengxian and Cheng＠ in the Zhengzhou area, with a population of more than 3.5 million in over ten counties, has been successfully concluded; in another 40 counties with a population of approximately 8 million, a bandit-clearing and anti-despot movement has been carried out and has successfully transitioned into an anti-despot rent reduction movement. In November, various levels of cadres' mass work meetings were convened from top to bottom in various parts of Henan to examine the actual work of mobilizing peasants in this stage, check the implementation of policies, and rectify the thinking of cadres, in order to consolidate the existing village work foundation and prepare for a larger-scale rural mass movement this winter and next spring.
    From the provincial perspective, after the great victory of bandit suppression, the vast rural areas of Henan have initially established people's order, and the relationship between urban and rural areas has gradually become closer. The rural areas that have undergone the anti-despot struggle have further destroyed the feudal rule of the despotic landlords and abolished the old Baojia system; the peasant ranks have grown stronger, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been initially established, with peasants controlling rural power. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants has been raised, enabling Henan to overcome the water, drought, and locust plagues in agriculture this year and complete the autumn harvest and wheat planting.
    (II) Development Process and Work Steps of the Movement
    Over the past five months, the peasant movement in Henan Province has generally been divided into two stages: bandit suppression and anti-despotism. This is because bandits and despots in Henan are combined, with despots often being the leaders of bandits, relying on bandit armed forces to oppress peasants; while bandits are supported by despots and serve reactionary forces. It is necessary to first eliminate the bandits, so that the despots lose their armed forces and cannot oppress the peasants by force, only then can the peasants raise their heads and dare to fight against the despots. The first stage has gone through three steps: encircling and suppressing major bandits, garrisoning and suppressing scattered bandits, and clearing bandits and opposing despots. However, within the scope of the province, because the degree of work development is different, these steps are intertwined.
    The step of encircling and suppressing major bandits was relatively short, roughly ending from late July to early August. After the beginning of August, a part of the major bandits in various places had been annihilated, and most of the major bandits were defeated and dispersed or hidden; some of them adopted a two-faced policy of false surrender and false registration to the government. The Provincial People's Government and the People's Armed Forces, based on changes in the situation, promptly switched to decentralized garrisoning, implementing the transformation of troops (mainly the main force) into work teams, cooperating with local work cadres to transform into political offensives supplemented by military offensives, and garrisoning and suppressing scattered bandits with the assistance of the vast number of peasant masses. At this time, the troops had opened up the situation of rural work, and most areas of the province immediately launched united front work in the countryside, carried out in-depth struggles against scattered and hidden bandits, widely publicized the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and meritorious service will be rewarded," and clearly announced the determination of "no withdrawal of troops until the bandits are eliminated." This not only greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for bandit suppression, but also played a great role in disintegrating the bandit ranks. During the garrisoning, the bandit leaders and stubborn remnants were resolutely suppressed and attacked. At the same time, by controlling the old Baojia and using internal contradictions of the bandits, a large-scale movement to win over bandit soldiers and collect bandit guns was achieved. After two months of clearing, in August and September, more than 45,000 bandits were eliminated in the province, 75 percent of whom were disintegrated through political efforts. After garrisoning, the major bandits in Henan have been largely suppressed, and the scattered and hidden bandits have also been largely cleared. At this time, the peasant masses urgently demanded the capture of bandit leaders and the attack on the big despots colluding with the bandits, and demanded the crushing of the Baojia system that oppressed the people. The peasant struggle enthusiasm rose day by day. On the enemy side, the remaining bandit leaders and small groups of bandits sneaked into cities, remote villages or deep mountains and dense forests, still attempting to threaten peasants and control scattered bandits in various places, and a few infiltrated our interior to carry out sabotage activities. Therefore, the provincial Communist Party and the People's Government then launched a movement to clear scattered bandits and dig out bandit roots (despotic landlords colluding with bandits), relying on the peasant masses, uniting all possible united social forces in the countryside, and launching a mass-based anti-bandit and anti-despot struggle. First, select certain districts and villages as key points, organize people's courts, and, based on the accusations of the people, try local bandit leaders and big despots who have committed heinous crimes, in order to remove the ideological concerns of the people in the area and boost the morale of the masses, thereby discovering and cultivating active elements among the peasants. Then, convene county and district peasant representative meetings, and through representatives and active elements, extensively and deeply conduct policy propaganda and grievance education for the peasant masses, carry out the struggle of clearing bandits and opposing despots in a comprehensive manner, and use the experience of key work areas to guide the overall struggle of peasants. In areas of the province that have gone through this step, the ruling prestige of bandits and despots has been initially defeated by the peasants, the bandits have been largely suppressed, and the political awareness of the peasants has also been improved a step further. Now nearly half of the counties in Henan Province have successfully entered the anti-despot movement after this stage, and some rural areas in Huangchuan, Nanyang, and Shanzhou areas are still carrying out this first stage of the struggle.
    In areas where bandits have been cleared and bandit roots dug out, the peasant consciousness has been raised. In October, the struggle against the despot and for rent reduction was launched in full scale. In these areas, with poor peasants and hired farmers as the backbone, the broad masses of middle peasants were united, and all possible united and neutral social forces in the rural areas were united or neutralized. In this stage, the peasants politically defeated the ruling group of the landlord class, disarmed the landlords, established the people's armed forces, transformed the rural power, and established the people's democratic rule. At the same time, in the liquidation of the crimes of the despots, the peasants also recovered some of the wealth that the despots had extorted. In the districts and villages where the movement was deepened, the peasants, according to the rent reduction decrees of the People's Government, demanded rent reduction, and immediately combined the anti-despot movement with rent reduction. The work steps in this stage are still to start with key mobilization and gradually extend to the whole area. In the movement, the consciousness of the peasants was further enhanced, and the peasant organizations were further strengthened and consolidated.
    There are also some counties in Henan that have undergone the anti-despot and rent reduction movement in the past, such as Jiaxian, Baofeng, and Linru in Xuchang Prefecture and some counties in Luoyang and Zhengzhou Prefectures. In these areas, bandits and despots have been hit to some extent, the feudal economy has been weakened in most parts, and the peasants have established their own organizations and initially grasped power and armed forces. However, because the previous work was relatively rough, there are still many despotic landlords who are plotting to restore their rule; the organizations of peasant associations and rural political power organs are impure, the thinking and style of village cadres are not correct, and the peasant advantage is not consolidated. Therefore, this kind of area is combined with the overall clearing and suppression to conduct a review movement of the past opposition to the despot and rent reduction, and to further attack the counter-attacking despotic landlords. At the same time, within the peasant internal, the rural cadres were evaluated and the peasant associations were rectified through peasant representative meetings and cadre meetings. By the end of October, areas with approximately 3.5 million people had completed the review, and the membership of the peasant associations generally expanded to 30 percent of the total number of peasants. The militia armed forces in Ye County and Baofeng County have developed to more than 7,100 people. This kind of area accounts for a little over 11 percent of the province in terms of area and population, and is an advanced area in the peasant movement in the province.
    (III) Main Reasons for the Victory of the Movement
    There are three main reasons for the rapid development and victory of the bandit suppression and anti-despot movement: First, the correct policy and the full ideological mobilization of party, government, and military cadres in the province. The working policy of "eliminating bandits, overthrowing despots, and mobilizing the masses" proposed by the Henan Provincial Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China in June was accepted by the People's Government and became the guiding principle of the peasant movement in Henan over the past five months. The development of the movement over the past five months has also proved that this policy is completely correct. The rapid development of the peasant movement in Henan depends on the overall mobilization of the party, government, and military at that time. At that time, the Communist Party organizations and troops in various places successively held party representative meetings or cadre meetings, conducted full ideological mobilization from top to bottom, and overcame the ideological bias of cadres being lightly armed and paralyzed and afraid of hardship.
    Second, whether it is bandit suppression or anti-despotism, there is a unified and strong leadership. During the period of bandit suppression, the province organized the Provincial Bandit Suppression Work Committee, and the combination zones of various special zones or counties and counties and districts and districts established local bandit suppression work committees or unified headquarters to unify leadership. Unified leading organs were also organized between cities and villages. Because the leadership and command were unified and the forces were concentrated, the bandits had no opportunity to take advantage of and were finally annihilated. After the anti-despot struggle was launched, the troops also implemented the work team system and participated in the work of mobilizing the masses. Under the unified leadership, the peasants were mobilized, all democratic forces in the rural society were united, and the feudal forces in the rural areas were defeated.
    Third, bandit suppression and anti-despotism are the most pressing demands of the vast peasant masses in the province. Because the Kuomintang reactionaries created a large number of bandits in Henan, harassing the people; and the rule of the despotic landlords imposed particularly deep pain on the peasants. For example, when the peasants in the Funiu Mountain area saw the troops enter the mountains to suppress bandits, they immediately repaired bridges and roads, milled flour and sent firewood, and actively supported the bandit suppression troops. Especially after the victory of encircling and suppressing major bandits, the peasants' ideological concerns about bandits were broken, and the masses' confidence in the struggle was boosted, and a mass bandit clearing movement was immediately launched. A large number of bandit leaders and hidden bandits were captured under the search and pursuit of the peasants. In the opposition to the despot, the peasants actively participated in the peasant associations, accused the despotic landlords of their crimes, exposed their various sabotage conspiracies, and automatically organized a militia armed force to protect the fruits of their liberation.
    (IV) Rectifying Cadre Thinking and Ushering in a Larger-Scale Peasant Movement
    Over the past five months, the peasant movement in Henan Province has achieved great results. However, some tendencies and shortcomings exist among some cadres participating in rural work: First, because the movement has developed rapidly and the peasants have high enthusiasm, some cadres and a few active elements have developed an acute illness. They attempted to completely eliminate feudal exploitation from liquidation in the anti-despot struggle at once, regardless of the level of awareness and organization of the majority of peasants. Sometimes they were eager to launch a comprehensive struggle, and at the beginning they engaged in joint struggles throughout the county or district. As a result, landlords, despots, and hooligans took the opportunity to infiltrate the peasant ranks, secretly carry out sabotage or usurp leadership, and create fake peasant associations and fake struggles. Second, there is a wrong idea among some cadres. They believe that in the work of mobilizing the masses, "If we want to talk about policies, we cannot let go. If we want to let go, we should not talk about policies." Therefore, serious deviations such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants, infringing on industry and commerce, and beating and arresting people have occurred in the movement in some areas. In leading the work, cadres used "letting go" as an excuse, did not want policies, and followed the masses. Third, some cadres' work style has narrow empiricism and bureaucracy problems. They do not study the actual situation in the new area, but mechanically apply the set of methods from the old liberated area.
    Around October 20, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial mass work meeting. This meeting summarized the work of mobilizing peasants in the past four months, conducted ideological criticism of various deviations in the work, and stipulated work disciplines that strictly prohibit random beating and killing, resolutely do not touch middle peasants, and protect industry and commerce, requiring party members and cadres to abide by them. After detailed research, this meeting determined the work steps and policy strategies for bandit suppression, anti-despotism, and rent reduction in rural reform, as well as a set of "mass line under leadership" work methods.
    In November, the peasant movement in various parts of Henan has been temporarily suspended. The rural work in the province has shifted to the autumn grain collection. At the same time, all parts of the province are reviewing the peasant movement, engaging in correcting deviations, rectifying peasant organizations, and rectifying the thinking of cadres, in order to consolidate the existing rural positions and prepare for a larger-scale peasant movement in the province this winter and next spring.

　　河南省五个月来的农民运动
    曲一凡
  　（一）全省运动概况
    河南省大规模的农民运动是在剿灭流窜于农村中的国民党残匪的基础上开展起来的。今年七月间，全省各地首先展开了全省范围的剿匪运动。随着剿匪的胜利，河南各地就及时转入了发动农民全面肃清土匪的运动，并结合清剿土匪开展了反动农村中封建恶霸的斗争。凡散匪已大体肃清的地区，农民运动则以进行反恶霸的斗争为主，大力发动和组织农民。反恶霸运动，即农村民主运动，是农民反动农村是最凶恶的封建统治者——恶霸地主的斗争，清算他们对农民压迫、屠杀、强取、豪夺种种残暴罪行。截至十月底，河南全省已有五十二个县（该省共八十五县），二百七十余个区，一千二百余万农民，卷入了轰轰烈烈的反恶霸运动。其中许昌专区的郏县、宝丰、临汝等，洛阳专区的伊阳、洛阳等，和郑州专区的郑县、成＠等十余县三百五十余万人口的地区，农民反恶霸的斗争已经胜利结束；另四十余县约八百万人口的地区，已进行了清匪反恶霸运动，并已胜利转入反恶霸减租运动。十一月份，河南各地自上而下地召开了各级干部的群众工作会议，检查这一阶段发动农民的实际工作，检查政策的执行情形和整顿干部的思想，以巩固现有的村工作基础，准备迎接今冬明春更大规模的农村群众运动。
    从全省范围来说，经过剿匪的巨大胜利，河南广大农村已初步建立了人民秩序，城乡关系逐步密切。而进行了反恶霸斗争的农村，更进一步摧毁了恶霸地主的封建统治，废除了旧保甲制度；农民队伍日益壮大，初步建立了人民民主专政，农民掌握了农村政权。因而也就提高了广大农民的生产热情，使河南今年得以战胜农业上的水、旱、蝗灾，完成了秋收和种麦。
    （二）运动的发展过程和工作步骤
    五个月来河南省的农民运动，一般分为剿匪和反对恶霸两个阶段。因为河南土匪与恶霸是结合的，恶霸往往又是匪首，依仗土匪武装压迫农民；而土匪则受恶霸豢养，为反动势力服务。必须首先肃清土匪，使恶霸失去武装力量，不能以武力压迫农民，农民才能抬起头来，并敢于和恶霸斗争。第一个阶段又经过围剿股匪、驻剿散匪和清匪反恶霸三个步骤。但在全省的范围内，因为工作的发展程度不同，这些步骤又是交错进行的。
    围剿股匪这个步骤时间较短，自七月下旬至八月上旬即已大体结束。八月上旬后，各地股匪一部已告歼灭，大部股匪被击溃而分散或稳蔽起来；其中且有一些对政府采取假投降、假登记的两面政策。该省人民政府和人民武装，即根据情况变化及时转入了分散驻剿，实行部队（主要是主力部队）工作队化，配合当地工作干部转变为以政治攻势为主，军事攻势为辅，在广大农民群众援助下驻剿散匪。这时，部队已打开农村工作的局面，该省大部地区立即开展农村统一战线工作，向分散、潜藏的土匪进行深入的斗争，广泛地宣传“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策，明确地宣布了“匪不剿灭，决不收兵”的决心。这样不但对群众剿匪情绪鼓励很大，对瓦解匪众也起了很大的作用。驻剿中，对于匪首和顽抗的残匪，坚决给以镇压和打击。同时，以控制旧保甲和利用土匪内部矛盾，达到了大规模地争取匪众、收缴匪枪的运动。经八、九两月的清剿，全省即消灭匪众四万五千余名，其中百分之七十五是经政治争取瓦解的。经过驻剿，河南股匪大体上已被肃清，散匪潜匪亦大部被清除。这时，农民群众迫切要求捕捉匪首和打击与土匪勾结的大恶霸，要求粉碎压榨人民的保甲制度。农民斗争热情逐日上升。敌人方面，剩下的土匪首脑和小股土匪，则潜入城市、穷乡僻村或深山密林中，仍图威胁农民和控制各处散匪，并有少数打入我内部进行破坏活动。因此，该省共产党和人民政府随即发动清散匪、挖匪根（与土匪勾结的恶霸地主）的运动，依靠农民群众，联合农村中一切以可联合的社会力量，发动群众性的清匪反恶霸斗争。先选择一定区村作重点，组织人民法庭，根据人民的控诉，审判当地罪大恶极的匪首和大恶霸，以解除该地区人民的思想顾虑，鼓舞群众斗志，从而发现和培养农民中的积极分子。然后即召集县、区农民代表会议，通过代表和积极分子，广泛深入地对农民群众进行政策宣传和诉苦教育，把清匪的反恶霸的斗争作面的开展，并以工作重点区的经验，来指导农民的全面的斗争。该省凡经过这一步骤的地区，土匪、恶霸的统治威风就被农民初步打垮，大体肃清了土匪，农民的政治觉悟程度也提高了一步。现在河南全省有将近一半的县份已经经过这个阶段顺利地转入了反恶霸运动，潢川、南阳、陕州等专区还有部分农村正进行着这个第一阶段的斗争。
    经过清匪，挖匪根的地区，土匪肃清、农民觉悟提高，十月份就进入了全面反恶霸减租斗争。这些地区，以贫雇农为骨干，团结了广大的中农，联合或中立了农村中一切可能联合和中立的社会力量，在这一阶段中，农民从政治上打垮了地主阶级的当权集团，解除了地主的武装；建立了人民的武装，改造了乡村的政权，确立了人民的民主统治。同时，在对恶霸罪行的清算中，农民在经济上也收回了些恶霸强取豪夺的财物。运动深入的区村，农民根据人民政府的减租法令，要求减租者，当即结合反恶霸运动进行了减租。这一阶段的工作步骤，仍是先则重点发动逐渐推广到面。运动中农民觉悟更加提高，农民的组织也更加壮大和巩固。
    河南还有一些过去曾经过反恶霸和减租运动的县份，如许昌专区之郏县、宝丰、临汝和洛阳、郑州专区的一些县，这些地区，土匪、恶霸已受到过一些打击，封建经济也被削弱大部，农民已建立了自己的组织，初步掌握了政权和武装。但因过去的工作较粗糙，仍有不少恶霸地主阴谋复辟；农会和农村政权机构组织不纯，村干部思想作风不正，农民优势不巩固。因此，这种地区结合全面清剿，便进行了一次对过去反对恶霸和减租的复查运动，进一步打击反攻的恶霸地主。同时，在农民内部，则通过农民代表会、干部会，进行了评量农村干部和整顿农会。到十月底，已有约三百五十余万人的地区完成了复查，农会会员一般扩大到农民总数的百分之三十。叶县、宝丰两县民兵武装已发展到七千一百余人。这种地区从面积和人口约占全省的百分之十一强，为该省农民运动的先进地区。
    （三）运动胜利的主要原因　
    剿匪反霸运动迅速开展和胜利的主要原因有三：第一是方针正确和全省党政军干部有充分的思想动员。六月中共河南代表会议，提出的“肃清土匪、打倒恶霸、发动群众”的工作方针，为人民政府所接受，并成为河南五个月来农民运动指导原则。五个月来的运动发展，也证明了这个方针是完全正确的。河南农民运动的迅速展开，则有赖于当时党、政、军的全体动员。当时各地的中共组织和各部队都先后开过党代表会或干部大会，自上而下，进行了充分的思想动员，克服了干部的轻敌麻痹和害怕艰苦的思想偏向。
    第二，无论剿匪或反对恶霸，都有统一的坚强的领导。剿匪时期，该省组织了全省剿匪工作委员会，各专区或县和县、区和区的结合地带，则成立了地方性的剿匪工作委员会或统一指挥部来统一领导。城市和乡村之间，也组织有统一的领导机关。由于领导和指挥的统一，力量集中，就使土匪无隙可乘，最后被歼。反恶霸斗争开展起来后，部队也实行工作队化，参加了发动群众的工作，在统一的领导下，发动农民，联合了农村社会中的一切民主力量，打垮了农村的封建势力。
    第三，剿匪和反恶霸是该省广大农民群众的最迫切的要求。因为国民党反动派在河南制造了大量土匪，骚害人民；而恶霸地主的统治加于农民的痛苦特深。例如：伏牛山区农民见部队入山剿匪，立即修桥补路，磨面送柴，积极支援剿匪部队。特别经过围剿股匪的胜利，打破了农民对土匪的思想顾虑，鼓舞了群众斗争的信心，就立即展开了群众的清匪运动，大批匪首、潜匪，都在农民的搜索追捕下落网。在反对恶霸时，农民们纷纷参加农会，控诉恶霸地主的罪行，揭穿了他们的各种破坏阴谋，并自动组织起保卫翻身果实的民兵武装。
    （四）整顿干部思想，迎接更大规模的农民运动
    五个月来，河南省农民运动已取得了巨大的成绩。但在参加农村工作的一部分干部中存在着某些倾向和缺点：第一，由于运动发展快，农民热情高，有些干部和少数积极分子，就产生了急性病。他们企图一下子就在反恶霸斗争时从清算中完全消灭封建封剥削，即不管大多数农民的觉悟程度和组织程度如何。有时则急于全面展开大斗争，一开始就搞全县或全区的联合斗争，结果地主恶霸和流氓分子乘机混入农民队伍，暗中进行破坏或篡夺领导权，制造假农会和假斗争。第二，某些干部中存在着一种错误思想，他们认为发动群众的工作，“要讲政策，就不能放手，要放手就不应讲政策”。因此，部分地区运动中发生了侵犯中农利益、侵犯工商业以及打人捕人等严重的偏向。干部在领导工作上借口“放手”，不要政策，作了群众的尾巴。第三，部分干部的工作作风有狭隘的经验主义和官僚主义毛病。他们不研究新区的实际情况，机械地搬用老解放区的一套办法。
    十月二十日前后，中共河南省委会会召开过一次全省群众工作会议。这次会议总结了过去四个月来的发动农民的工作，对工作中各种偏向进行了思想批判，并规定了严禁乱打乱杀、坚决不动中农、保护工商业的工作纪律，要求党员干部务必遵守。这次会议经过详细研究之后，确定了农村改革中剿匪、反对恶霸和减租息的工作步骤和政策策略，以及一套“有领导的群众路线”的工作方法。
    十一月份，河南各地农民运动已暂时停止，该省农村工作转入秋季征粮，同时全省各地都在检讨农民运动，从事纠正偏向、整顿农民组织、整顿干部思想等工作，以巩固现有农村阵地，准备迎接今冬明春该省更大规模的农民运动。
