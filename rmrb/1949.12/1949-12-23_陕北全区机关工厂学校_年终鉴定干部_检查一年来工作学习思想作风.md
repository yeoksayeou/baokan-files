Throughout Northern Shaanxi, all organs, factories, and schools are conducting year-end appraisals of cadres to examine their work, study, thought, and style over the past year.

[Report from this Newspaper] From this month until the end of January next year, all on-the-job cadres in Northern Shaanxi and Yan'an's organs, schools, and factories who are not directly involved in production will undergo a year-end appraisal of their work, study, thought, and style. This is the first time that such a comprehensive year-end appraisal of cadres has been implemented in the region. The *Masses Daily*, the official newspaper of the Northern Shaanxi Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial stating that this appraisal of cadres is a very significant and meticulous task, which is of great importance for improving cadres and developing future production, construction, and cultural construction in Northern Shaanxi. It recommended that leading organs at all levels complete this new task effectively.

Regarding the main content of the cadre appraisal, the newspaper pointed out that it should be based primarily on Northern Shaanxi's central tasks for this year—production and land registration—and study, in conjunction with the specific work and daily life and thought, and work style of each individual. In particular, individual academic performance should be regarded as one of the most important aspects of the appraisal.

The purpose of the appraisal is, on the one hand, to enable each cadre to make a systematic and comprehensive summary and profound review and analysis of his or her work, study, thought, and style over the past year. Through mutual criticism and assistance at the appraisal meetings, each cadre can more clearly recognize his or her strengths and weaknesses, so as to continue to promote the former or strive to overcome the latter, and implement them in future work to improve performance. At the same time, through the appraisal, the relationship between cadres and between superiors and subordinates can be closer and more united, which will facilitate the development of work. On the other hand, based on the appraisal, the leading organs can comprehensively understand each cadre under their jurisdiction, grasp the overall situation of the cadres, so as to more appropriately use cadres and systematically educate cadres and help them to progress.

To do this work well, the *Masses Daily* suggested that in-depth and effective publicity and mobilization should be carried out within and outside the Party. Organs at all levels should proceed in a step-by-step manner. Full democracy should be promoted during the appraisal to prevent perfunctoriness or the tendency to view the appraisal as something mysterious. At the same time, attention should be paid to the comprehensiveness of the cadre appraisal, and it should not be one-sided to draw conclusions based on a cadre's temporary advantages or disadvantages in a certain aspect.

The editorial called on all Party cadres in Northern Shaanxi to examine themselves in a sincere, frank, and realistic spirit; to examine others in a responsible manner, with kindness, mutual assistance, and a willingness to say everything they know, so that the work, study, thought, and style of cadres throughout the region can move forward after this appraisal.

　　陕北全区机关工厂学校
    年终鉴定干部
    检查一年来工作学习思想作风
    【本报讯】自本月份起至明年一月底止，陕北区各地及延安各机关、学校、工厂所有脱离生产的在职干部，均将进行一次一年来的工作、学习、思想作风的鉴定。这种普遍性的干部年终鉴定，在该区是第一次实行，中共陕北区党委机关报群众日报为此发表社论，说明这次鉴定干部，是一件意义非常重大而又细致的工作，对提高干部，开展陕北区今后的生产建设工作和文化建设等工作有着很大的关系，建议各级领导机关很好的完成此一新的任务。
    关于鉴定干部的主要内容，该报指出主要是根据陕北区今年的中心工作——生产，土地登记——和学习，配合各人所担负的具体工作及日常生活、思想作风来进行；尤其是要把个人的学习成绩作为鉴定重要内容之一。
    鉴定的目的，一方面是使每个干部对自己一年来的工作、学习、思想作风等作一次有系统的、全面的总结及深刻的检讨、分析，经过鉴定会议的互相批评帮助，使每个干部更明确地认识自己的优缺点，从而继续发扬或努力克服，并贯彻到今后工作中去，以提高工作；同时通过鉴定，使干部之间与上下级之间的关系更加亲密团结，以利开展工作。另一方面，领导机关根据鉴定，能全面的了解所属每个干部，掌握干部全般情况，以便更适当地使用干部和有计划地教育干部，帮助其进步。　
　要作好此一工作，群众日报建议首先在党内外进行深入有效的宣传动员；各级机关要有步骤地进行；鉴定中充分发扬民主，防止潦草从事或把鉴定看得很神秘等偏向；同时，鉴定干部要注意全面性，不要片面地抓住一个干部一时的某一方面的一个优缺点就下结论。
    社论号召全陕北党员干部要以诚恳、坦白、实事求是的精神检查自己；要以认真负责、与人为善、互相帮助、知无不言言无不尽的态度检查别人，使全区干部的工作、学习、思想、作风在这次鉴定后前进一步。
