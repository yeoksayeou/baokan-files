　　Yanjing University Political Curriculum Committee
  　Holds "From Ape to Man" Exhibition
    [This newspaper dispatch] The "From Ape to Man" science exhibition arranged by the Yanjing University Political Curriculum Committee ran from November 14th to the 22nd. The exhibition included models, charts, and photographs, providing visitors with clear scientific evidence proving that "labor created mankind itself." In addition, many photographs of modern ethnic groups were exhibited, proving that all races in the world are one family, breaking the narrow nationalist views of the bourgeoisie. More than a thousand people visited during the week.

    [This newspaper dispatch] The first weekly lecture of the Beijing Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association was held on the morning of the 4th. More than 300 people attended. Zhou Weizhi from the Ministry of Culture spoke on "Talking about Workers' Literature and Art." The second lecture is scheduled for 9:30 am on the 11th at the Democratic Theater. Also, because the number of people who signed up for the lecture exceeded the original quota, resulting in an insufficient number of lecture tickets, supplementary tickets will be issued starting on the 8th.
