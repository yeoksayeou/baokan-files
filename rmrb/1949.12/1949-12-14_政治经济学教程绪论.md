    The Object of Study, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economy
    Section 3: The Class Nature, Party Spirit, and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    The third characteristic of Marxist-Leninist political economy is its class nature, party spirit, and internationalism.

    The Meaning of Class Nature
    Marxist-Leninists believe that any scientific theory, in a class society, is of a class, belonging to a certain class, or possessing class nature. This is because any scientific theory is based on the practice, interests, and demands of a certain class, and is created by representatives representing the interests and demands of that class, used to express the interests and demands of that class. This certain class status, class interests, and class demands are contained in various forms in various scientific theories and people's ideological consciousness. This scientific theory with a certain class content has always been a tool for people to conduct class struggle, and each class must use them for the benefit of its own class and for its own service. This is the meaning of the class nature of scientific theory.

    The Difference in Class Nature Between Marxist-Leninist Political Economy and Bourgeois Political Economy
    Political economy has been a class science from the beginning, because the object it studies touches on people's most basic interests, the most basic class interests, so it reflects class interests and class contradictions most directly and sharply, so its relationship with class struggle is particularly close.
    Marxist-Leninist political economy never conceals its class nature, and openly promotes it. It is a weapon representing the interests of the proletariat in its class struggle against the bourgeoisie. The class it represents is the most revolutionary, most progressive, and most promising proletariat and working class of modern times. The interests and demands it reflects are also the interests and demands of the most revolutionary, most progressive, and most promising humans of modern times—the proletariat and the working class. Therefore, its class nature is also the most revolutionary and most advanced. The bourgeoisie, apart from having some progressiveness in the early stage of capitalist development, has become increasingly parasitic and decadent as capitalism has developed, heading towards decline, decay, and reaction. The bourgeoisie has become a parasitic, corrupt, decadent, and reactionary class that does not work for its food, and increasingly exhibits its parasitism, corruption, decay, and reaction. Regarding the class nature of bourgeois political economy, Marx described it this way in the preface to the first edition of the first volume of Capital:
    “In the domain of political economy, free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as in all other domains. The peculiar nature of the material it deals with, summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent, mean and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest. The English Established Church, e.g., will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of its 39 articles than on 1/39 of its income. Nowadays atheism itself is a comparatively light offence as compared with criticism of existing property relations.”

    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    马列主义政治经济学的特点之三，是它的阶级性、党派性、与国际性。
    阶级性的意义
    马列主义者认为任何一种科学理论，在阶级社会里，都是阶级的，都是属于一定的阶级，或者俱有阶级性的。因为任何一种科学理论，都是基于一定的阶级实践，一定的阶级利益和一定的阶级要求的反映，并且都是由代表一定的阶级利益和阶级利益的代表人物所创造，用以表现一定的阶级利益和阶级要求。这种一定的阶级地位、阶级利益和阶级要求，以各种不同的形式包含在各种科学理论和人们的思想意识中，这种具有一定的阶级内容的科学理论，历来就是人们进行阶级斗争的工具，各阶级都要为本阶级为本身的利益而利用它们来为阶级，以及为本身服务。这是科学理论的阶级性的意义。
    马列主义政治经济学与资产阶级政治经济学不同的阶级性的区别
    政治经济学自始就是阶级性的科学，因为它所研究的对象触及着人们最基本的利益，最基本的阶级利益，所以它反映阶级利益与阶级矛盾最为直接最为锐敏，因此它与阶级斗争的关系也特别密切。
    马列主义政治经济学从不隐讳它的阶级性，并且公开宣传它，它是代表无产阶级利益与资产阶级进行阶级斗争的武器，它所代表的阶级是近代最革命最进步最有前途的无产阶级和工人阶级，它所反映的利益和要求，也是近代最革命最进步最有前途的人类——无产阶级与工人阶级的利益和要求，所以它的阶级性也是最革命、最前进的。资产阶级除了资本主义发展初期还具有它若干进步性以外，由于嗣后资本主义高度发展，资本主义愈益表现其寄生性腐烂性，走向没落衰亡与反动的道路，资产阶级变为不劳而食的寄生腐朽没落反动的阶级，而愈益表现其寄生性、腐料性与没落性与反动性。关于资产阶级政治经济学的阶级性，马克思在资本论第一卷第一版序文中曾这样描写过：
    “在经济学领域内，不仅自由的科学研究，所遇到的敌人，和在其它一切领域内所遇到的相同。而且经济学所处理的材料的独特的本性，会唤起人心中最激烈最狭窄最厌恶的情念，把从私人利害出发的忿怒召唤到以自由的科学研究为敌的战场上来。例如英国国教会，可以对你在他三十九条信条中攻击了它三十八条的罪行赦宥，却不能宽恕你对他货币所得的三十九分之一的攻击。在今天，无神论本身，如与从来对所有权关系的批判比较起来，罪戾是要比较地轻一些的。”
