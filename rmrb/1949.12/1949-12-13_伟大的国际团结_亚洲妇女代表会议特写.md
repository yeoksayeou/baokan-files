　　Great International Solidarity
    ——A Feature on the Asian Women's Representative Conference
    Bo Sheng, Chen Ji
  　(I) Different Languages Expressed a Common Will
    Democratic women from all over the world have expressed boundless joy and warm support for the Asian Women's Representative Conference held in China!
    When Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, stood on the rostrum and shouted in an excited and impassioned voice: "Our struggle is by no means isolated... The people of the world who love peace and freedom—workers, peasants, intellectuals, women, and youth—are with us, and the entire world peace and democracy camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, is with us..." When she shouted, "History has pronounced the death sentence on imperialism and reactionaries. Let us carry out this verdict!" the whole venue erupted in waves of fighting and victory, again and again.
    Dozens of different languages expressed a common will—to eliminate the common enemy, the imperialists and their lackeys in various countries, in order to win national independence, people's democracy, and world peace!
    When representatives or guests from each country came to the rostrum to speak, they paid a fighting, warm salute to the conference, to the Soviet and Chinese sisters, and to all Asian women and the Women's International Democratic Federation. When the representatives of Indonesia and Vietnam used excited voices at the conference to accuse the imperialist Dutch and French governments of cruelly persecuting the people and women of their countries, it was as if we clearly saw those young and brave women of the Indonesian guerrillas who had run out of the tropical rubber plantations and tea farms to participate in the struggle against the Dutch imperialists, and also the heroic Vietnamese women who waded through the mud in Vietnam and used grenades to kill the French imperialists. Guests from the Netherlands and France attending the conference expressed their warmest condolences to the conference and to the representatives of Indonesia and Vietnam in passionate and sincere tones. They shouted: The imperialists must be overthrown!
    The French representative Ginette Vaillant and the Vietnamese representative Ho Thi Chi exchanged gifts of fighting friendship at the meeting. Ginette Vaillant cordially handed a French flag to Ho Thi Chi, and Ho Thi Chi also handed the red flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Ginette Vaillant. After that, the French representative gave the Vietnamese representative the list of French soldiers who died in the war of aggression against Vietnam. These lists were registered by French progressive women when they mobilized women to investigate the families of these sacrificed soldiers in order to oppose the war of aggression.
    This great and vivid scene of internationalist friendship was filled with deeply moving emotions. People deeply believed that the strength of the people of imperialist countries and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries has been united, and this force can defeat all enemies, just as the Vietnamese representative Ho Thi Chi said: If we act together, victory belongs to us.
    (II) Unite Around the Soviet Union
    Ho Thi Chi recited a song born from the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism: "In the distant sky, factories emit black smoke, this is the Soviet Union, this is the Soviet Union; she raises millions of wrists, pushing the wheels of progress forward...! Soviet Union, Soviet Union, you illuminate the dark world shrouded by imperialism, do you know? On our side, as long as we think of the bright world in front of the people, our hearts tremble!" The entire venue looked at her. She held a bright red flag and walked to the Soviet representative, Bafunova, and placed the red flag in Bafunova's hands. Bafunova hugged Ho Thi Chi tightly, reluctant to let go. In the melodious military music, the representatives of hundreds of millions of women were listening to the voice of the Vietnamese people: "Under the brilliant illumination of the Soviet Union, for the independence of our motherland, we have fought bravely and advanced wave upon wave. We have already seized 90 percent of the land, and we will receive sisters from various countries on the free land, just as the Chinese people are receiving them today."
    "The path taken by Soviet women is the path we all want to take." After the Soviet representative Bafunova spoke, people's hearts were repeatedly thinking about this sentence. When Bafunova mentioned the happy life of Soviet women, thunderous applause erupted from the whole venue; every time Bafunova introduced Soviet women labor heroes, people stood up with a roar and shouted again and again: "Salute to the socialist labor heroes;" and again and again they requested: "We want to see Comrade Ubaidullayeva, the socialist labor hero!" Every time Bafunova mentioned Stalin's name, all the representatives shouted "Stalin" in the same loud voice, with the languages of more than ten countries repeatedly converging into the same sound like waves: "Long live! Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live!"
    Bafunova stood next to Cai Chang and said enthusiastically: "I represent Soviet women in paying tribute to the Chinese people! Pay tribute to the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!" Bafunova led the Soviet delegation and walked close to Cai Chang, presenting the gifts personally made by the women of Soviet Central Asia to Chairman Mao! To Chinese women! To Cai Chang! In front of the giant portrait of Stalin woven from red wool, Bafunova and Cai Chang embraced three times in a row. Deng Yingchao excitedly shook hands and embraced several other Soviet representatives. Li Dequan enthusiastically led the whole venue to shout: "Long live Soviet women!" The Chinese representatives faced the seats of the Soviet representatives and shouted with their hands raised: "Learn from Soviet women!" The Chinese representatives, carrying the brocade banner embroidered by Hunan women and the four porcelain portraits presented by Jiangxi women, walked onto the rostrum and said cordially to the Soviet representatives: "Our Central China women ask Comrade Bafunova to take this small gift to Stalin, thanking him for his help to the Chinese people!" The Soviet representatives all left their seats, waving and cheering continuously: Long live great international solidarity! Long live the solidarity of Chinese and Soviet women! Long live the solidarity of democratic women all over the world!

　　伟大的国际团结
    ——亚洲妇女代表会议特写
    柏生　陈迹
  　（一）不同的语言表达了共同的意志
    全世界的民主妇女对于在中国召开的亚洲妇女代表会议，都表示了无限的欢欣与热烈拥护！
    当中华全国民主妇联副主席邓颖超站在大会主席台上，用兴奋激昂的声音喊着：“我们的斗争绝不是孤立的……遍于全世界的爱好和平自由的人民——工人、农民、知识分子、妇女、青年，是和我们在一起，以伟大的苏联为首的整个世界和平民主阵营是和我们在一起……”的时候，当她喊着“历史已经宣判了帝国主义和反动派的死刑。让我们来执行这个判决！”的时候，全场一次再一次的掀起了战斗胜利的热潮。
    数十种不同的语言，表达了一个共同的意志——为了争取民族独立，人民民主与世界和平，要消灭共同的敌人，帝国主义者及其在各国的走狗！
    每一个国家的代表或来宾走到主席台上讲话时，都向大会以及苏联和中国的姊妹们致战斗的、热烈的敬礼，向全亚洲妇女和国际民主妇联致敬。当印尼和越南的代表用激动的声音，在大会上控诉帝国主义的荷兰和法国政府对她们国家的人民和妇女进行着的残酷迫害时，我们象是清楚地看到了那些从热带的橡胶园和茶场里跑出来，参加对荷兰帝国主义者斗争的印尼游击队的年青勇敢的妇女，也看到了在越南的泥潭中跋涉前进，用手榴弹打死了法帝国主义者的英勇战斗的越南妇女。荷兰、法国出席大会的来宾以激昂恳切的声调向大会以及印尼、越南的代表致最热烈的慰问。他们高呼：帝国主义者是一定要打倒的！
    法国代表金耐特·凡尔米希和越南代表胡德明在会上交换了战斗的友谊的礼物，金耐特·凡尔米希将一面法国国旗亲切地递给胡德明，胡德明也把越南人民共和国的红色国旗交给金耐特·凡尔米希之后，法国代表更将在侵略越南战争中死去的法国的士兵的名册送给越南的代表。这些名册是法国近步妇女为了反对侵略战争动员妇女向这些牺牲了士兵家属进行调查时登记下来的。
    这伟大生动的国际主义的友爱场面，洋溢着深深动人的感情。人们的心里深深地相信着，帝国主义国家的人民与殖民地半殖民地国家的人民的力量，已经结合在一起了，这个力量可以战胜一切敌人，正如越南代表胡德明所说：我们大家一致行动，胜利是属于我们的。
    （二）团结在苏联周围
    胡德明朗诵越南人民在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争里产生出来的歌曲：“在遥远的天边，工厂冒着黑烟，这是苏联，这就是苏联；她举起了千万双的手腕，推动着进步的车轮向前……！苏联，苏联，你照明了帝国主义所笼罩的黑暗的世界，你知道么？在我们这边，只要一想到光明的世界就在人民的眼前，我们的心都要动颤！”整个会场望着她。她举着一面鲜丽的红旗，走到苏联代表巴菲诺娃面前，把红旗放到巴菲诺娃的手里。巴菲诺娃抱着胡德明，紧紧地，不舍得离开。在悠扬的军乐声里，代表着亿万妇女的代表们，都在听着越南人民的声音：“我们在苏联的光辉的照明之下，为了自己祖国的独立，前仆后继，奋勇前进，我们已经夺取了百分之九十的土地，我们就要在自由的土地上接待着象今天中国人民接待着的各国姊妹。”
    “苏联妇女所走的道路，就是我们大家所要走的道路。”苏联代表巴菲诺娃发言以后，人们的心里都在反复思索着这句话。当巴菲诺娃每讲到苏联妇女幸福生活时，全场爆发出雷鸣的掌声；每当巴菲诺娃介绍到苏联妇女劳动英雄时，人们都轰然站立起来，一阵又一阵地高呼：“向社会主义劳动英雄致敬；”一次又一次地要求：“我们要看看社会主义劳动英雄乌巴伊杜拉耶娃同志！”一每当巴菲诺娃提到斯大林名字时，所有的代表都同样地响亮地喊着“斯大林”十多国的语言如浪涛似的反复的汇成同一声音：“万岁！乌拉！乌拉！万岁！”
    巴菲诺娃站在蔡畅的旁边，热情地说：“我代表苏联妇女向中国人民致敬！向中国人民领袖毛泽东致敬！”巴菲诺娃引着苏联代表，走近蔡畅身边，把苏联中央亚细亚妇女亲自制成的礼物，献给毛主席！献给中国妇女！献给蔡畅！在红毛织成的斯大林巨像前面，巴菲诺娃和蔡畅连续地拥抱了三次，邓颖超兴奋地和其他几位苏联代表握手拥抱，李德全热烈地领导着全场高呼：“苏联妇女万岁！”中国代表们都面对着苏联代表的座位，举手喊道：“向苏联妇女学习！”中国代表带着湖南妇女绣的锦旗和江西妇女献的四面瓷像，走上主席台，亲切地对着苏联代表们说：“我们华中妇女以这点小礼物，请巴菲诺娃同志带给斯大林，感谢他对中国人民的帮助！”苏联代表们都离开了座位，不停地招手，不停地欢呼：伟大的国际团结万岁！中苏妇女团结万岁！全世界民主妇女团结万岁！
