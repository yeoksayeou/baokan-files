　　Competition of Millions of People
   Truth Daily Editorial, December 7th
    The selfless constructive labor of the Soviet people is increasing day by day. Millions of Soviet people, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, are striving to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and striving for the further strong improvement of the national economy of our great socialist motherland.
    The Soviet people live a socialist life. The characteristics of the new socialist life are clearly manifested in the Soviet people’s relationship to labor. They regard labor as a cause with significant national and social significance, a cause of honor and glory, a cause of fortitude and heroism.
    Comrade Stalin praised the labor of workers and peasants as great and creative labor, as labor that determines the fate of history.
    Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, in the struggle for the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have demonstrated their greatest loyalty to the ideas of Lenin and Stalin; in their selfless labor for the happiness of the Soviet motherland, they have demonstrated infinite energy and creativity.
    As millions of Soviet people and all progressive people prepare to celebrate the 70th birthday of the great leader and teacher of the working people, Stalin, our country has been enveloped in an incredible wave of patriotism. In factories, coal mines and oil fields, on railway transport and construction sites, in collective farms, state farms and machine tractor stations, a socialist competition has been launched widely and powerfully. Millions of people participating in this all-people competition take it as their task to commemorate Comrade Stalin’s 70th birthday with new labor achievements.
    The Soviet people concentrate their thoughts and feelings on the great leader of the people, and they are full of the desire to work better and produce more, so as to make the socialist motherland more consolidated and developed through their labor. The Soviet people regard Comrade Stalin’s wise instruction that socialism and labor are inseparable as a guide to their lives. All our achievements, all the historically significant victories achieved by our people through selfless labor and heroic struggle, are inextricably linked with the precious and beloved name of the great Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin is the inspirer and organizer of the Soviet people's improvement of labor and labor creativity. The socialist competition and shock work in our country during the First Five-Year Plan period; and the all-people Stakhanov movement – an advanced form of socialist competition – that arose during the Second Five-Year Plan period, are all connected with Comrade Stalin's name.
    The Party of Lenin and Stalin has paid attention to the leadership of socialist competition, and is now paying attention to it. This event clearly demonstrates the great Stalin’s care for new sprouts – the sprouts of communism, and does everything possible to support, consolidate, and develop them.
    Comrade Stalin, developing Lenin's theory on socialist competition and the role of socialist competition in Soviet society, pointed out that competition is the communist way of socialist construction based on the greatest initiative of millions of working masses.
    Comrade Stalin said: The great significance of competition lies in the communist education of the Soviet people.
    Comrade Stalin said at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "What is most obvious in competition is that it fundamentally changes people's views on labor, because it turns labor, which used to be humiliation and a heavy burden, into a glorious cause, a cause of honor, a cause of heroism and fortitude. There is no such thing and cannot be such a thing in capitalism."
    The powerful living force of socialist competition is clearly manifested in the Soviet people's struggle to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. As early as October 1949, our industrial products had exceeded the average monthly production volume of 1940 before the war by 50 percent, and exceeded the average production level of the future 1950 Five-Year Plan. Agriculture is also moving forward. This year's total grain harvest is more than in 1948, exceeding the harvest of 1940 before the war. Livestock production has also increased significantly.
    The vitality of competition is reflected in the fact that it is constantly enriched by new and newer forms. The Soviet people, trying to make all the potential in production serve the motherland, have widely launched a nationwide competition: to strive for better use of the circulation of funds and funds in enterprises, to strive to improve product quality and reduce costs, to strive for a strict system of saving and higher productivity.
    In the days of preparing for Comrade Stalin’s 70th birthday, the creative initiative of millions of workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals has further increased, and the socialist competition of the whole people has been more widely expanded.
    Thousands of enterprise groups are commemorating Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday with specific tasks of producing ore, coal and oil beyond the plan, and producing metal, machinery, electricity, building materials, light industry and other enterprise products beyond the plan.
    Metallurgists from the Urals and Siberia, central and southern regions, guarantee to produce high-quality pig iron, steel, rails and ore beyond the plan. Workers in Baku and other oil regions are welcoming this meaningful day by increasing production and oil processing. Coal miners from Donbass, Kuzbass, Podmoskovye, and Karaganda guarantee to produce a large amount of coal beyond the plan. Railway workers guarantee to transport tens of thousands of freight cars beyond the plan and improve work competition indicators.
    Soviet machine manufacturers are welcoming December 21st with new labor achievements. The Ilyich factory in Moscow has guaranteed to produce hundreds of electric motors and many other products beyond the plan on Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday. Other enterprises in the capital and machine-building factories in Leningrad, Ukraine, the Urals and the Volga region will produce machines, machine tools and equipment worth millions of rubles extra.
    Our forestry and chemical industries, building materials industry workers, light industry, food industry and other industrial departments, as well as men and women workers of various specialized professions, commemorate Stalin's birthday with outstanding labor achievements.
    Collective farm men and women members and workers of machine tractor stations and state farms, together with the working class, are welcoming Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday with the glorious patriotic cause of striving to further improve agriculture.
    Workers in science and culture, literature and art, and all our Soviet intellectuals, commemorate Comrade Stalin’s 70th birthday with new progress in creative activities. The Soviet people express their infinite love and loyalty to the beloved Stalin with touching labor for the motherland.
    All the Soviet people are welcoming Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday with new victories. And hope that the beloved leader will live long for the happiness and joy of all advanced mankind.
    Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the laborers of our country have completed tasks of worldwide historical significance. Under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people are dedicating themselves to labor, for the happiness of the socialist motherland, for the victory of communism!

　　数百万人民的竞赛
   真理报十二月七日社论
    苏联人民的忘我的建设性的劳动在逐日地增加着。数百万苏联人民在列宁——斯大林党的领导下，为争取提前完成战后五年计划而奋斗，为争取我们伟大的社会主义祖国的国民经济进一步强有力的提高而奋斗。
    苏联人民过着社会主义的生活。新的社会主义生活的特质，很明显地表现在苏联人民对于劳动的关系上。他们认为劳动是具有重大的国家的和社会的意义的事业，是荣誉与光荣的事业，是刚毅和英勇的事业。
    斯大林同志称赞工人和农民的劳动是伟大的和创造性的劳动，是决定历史命运的劳动。
    在布尔塞维克党领导下，在争取苏联社会主义胜利的斗争上，苏联人民对于列宁——斯大林的思想曾表现出自己最伟大的忠诚；在为苏维埃祖国幸福的忘我的劳动中，曾表现出无穷尽的精力和创造性。
    当数百万苏联人民和所有先进的人们，准备庆祝伟大领袖与劳动人民的导师斯大林七十大寿之际，我国已被不可思议的爱国高潮所笼罩着。在工厂、在煤矿和石油采掘场，在铁路运输和建筑场，在集体农场，国营农场和机器拖拉器站已广泛而强有力地展开了社会主义竞赛。参加这个全人民竞赛的数百万人民，以新的劳动功绩来纪念斯大林同志七十寿辰为自己的任务。
    苏联人民把自己的思想和感情都集中在伟大的人民领袖身上，他们充满着工作得更好和生产得更多的愿望，为的是以自己的劳动使社会主义祖国更加巩固和发扬起来。苏联人民把斯大林同志的社会主义和劳动是彼此不能分开的智慧的指示，作为自己生活的指南。我们的一切成就，我们人民由忘我的劳动和英勇的斗争所获得的一切具有历史意义的胜利，都与伟大的斯大林的珍贵而亲爱的名子难分难解联系着。
    斯大林同志是苏联人民提高劳动和劳动创造性的鼓舞者与组织者。在第一个五年计划时期我国的社会主义竞赛和突击工作；和第二个五年计划时期所产生的全人民的斯塔汉诺夫运动——社会主义竞赛的高级形式——都与斯大林同志的名字联系着。
    列宁和斯大林的党，对于社会主义竞赛的领导，曾给与了注意，并且现在也正注意着它，这件事清晰地表现出伟大的斯大林对于新的幼芽——共产主义的幼芽的关怀，并尽一切可能支持，巩固与发展它们。
    斯大林同志，发展了列宁关于社会主义竞赛的学说和社会主义竞赛在苏维埃社会里的作用，斯大林同志曾指示：竞赛是基于数百万劳动群众的最大积极性上的社会主义建设的共产主义的方式。
    斯大林同志曾说：竞赛的巨大意义是在于对苏联人民共产主义的教育事业中。
    斯大林同志在联共（布）第十六届大会上曾说：“竞赛中最明显的是它根本上改变了人对劳动的观点，因为它把从前是污辱和沉重的负担的劳动，改变成为光荣的事业，荣誉的事业，英勇与刚毅的事业。在资本主义里则没有而且不可能有这样的事。”
    社会主义竞赛的强有力的生活力量，明确地表现在苏联人民争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划的斗争中。还在一九四九年十月，我们的工业生产品，就已超过战前一九四零年的每月平均生产量的百分之五十，同时超过了未来的一九五零的五年计划的生产平均水平。农业也向前迈进。今年谷物总收获额多于一九四八年，超过战前一九四零年的收获。畜产也显著地增多了。
    竞赛的活力表现在它经常被新而又新的形式不断地丰富着。苏联人民企图把生产中的一切潜力，都使之服务于祖国，就广泛地展开了全民竞赛：以争取更好地利用企业中的基金与资金的流转，争取提高产品质量和降低成本，争取节省的严格制度和高等生产率。
    在准备斯大林同志七十寿辰的日子里，数百万工人、集体农场庄员、知识分子的创造性的倡议更进一步地增长起来，全人民的社会主义竞赛更广泛地扩大了。
    数千个企业团体都以超计划的生产矿石、煤和石油，以超计划的金属、机器、电力、建筑材料、轻工业和其他企业生产品的具体任务来纪念斯大林同志七十大寿。
    乌拉尔和西伯利亚，中部和南部冶金者，保证超计划生产优等品质的铣铁、钢、铁轨和矿石。巴库和其他石油区的工人们，以提高产量和石油的加工来迎接这个有意义的日子。顿巴斯、库兹巴斯、泡得莫斯科夫、克拉干得的煤矿工人，保证超计划地生产大量的煤。铁路工人保证超计划地运载数万车箱的货物并改善工作的竞赛指标。
    苏联机器制造者以新的劳动的功绩来迎接十二月二十一日。莫斯科的伊里奇工厂已保证在斯大林同志七十寿辰那天，超计划地生产数百个电动机和许多其他产品。首都的其他企业和列宁格勒、乌克兰、乌拉尔和包沃尔日耶的机器建筑工厂额外生产出价值数百万卢布的机器，母机和装备。
    我们的林业和化学工业、建筑材料业的工作者，轻工业、食品工业和其他工业部门，以及各种专门职业的男女工人们，以出色的劳动成就纪念斯大林寿辰。
    集体农场男女庄员和机器拖拉器站与国营农场的工作者们，和工人阶级一道，以争取进一步提高农业的光荣的爱国主义的事业，来迎接斯大林同志的七十寿辰。
    科学与文化、文学与艺术的工作者，以及我们苏维埃的全体知识分子，都以新的创作活动的进步，来纪念斯大林同志的七十寿辰，苏联人民以为了祖国的动人的劳动，表示着对亲爱的斯大林的无限热爱和忠诚。
    全体苏联人民，以新的胜利迎接着斯大林同志的七十寿辰。并希望亲爱的领袖为全体先进人类的幸福和快乐而万寿无疆。
    在斯大林同志领导下，我国劳动者完成了具有全世界历史意义的任务。在伟大的斯大林智慧的领导下，苏维埃人民献身地劳动着，为了社会主义祖国的幸福，为了共产主义的胜利！
