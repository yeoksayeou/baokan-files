　　Long Live Stalin
    Asian Women's Congress, French Women Guests Vermersch
    On the seventieth birthday of Stalin, the French people want to say: The Soviet revolution, the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, its struggle for peace, its victory in the anti-German, Italian, and Japanese imperialist war... all have made a most profound impression on the entire French workers' movement and democratic movement. In the depths of the mines, in the hard labor camps of the imperialists, the victory of socialism under Stalin's leadership, like sunshine, guides the French people in their struggle against oppressors. It guides our struggle against the oppressive measures of our own imperialist government against the colonies.
    After Stalin developed the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, he gave us a weapon for daily struggle.
    On his seventieth birthday, the French people want to offer him hundreds of gifts. We will say to him: For our beloved and great Comrade Joseph Stalin, the hearts of the French workers are filled with love, gratitude, and respect. We want to say to him: Our people's will is to fight until we completely defeat imperialism in our own country. We want to say to him: Fighters for peace and socialism are fighting all over the world; our will is to join the ranks of these fighters.
    Finally, we must also say to him: We will always be faithful to internationalism among all nations: Long live Joseph Stalin!

　　斯大林万岁
    亚洲妇代会、法国妇女来宾  维尔米什
    法国人民在斯大林的七十寿辰这一天，我们要说：苏联的革命，苏联的社会主义的建设，她的为和平的斗争，她的反德、意、日帝国主义战争中的胜利，……一切都给整个法国的工人运动和民主运动一个最深刻的印象。在矿井的深处，在帝国主义者的苦工场上，斯大林所领导的社会主义的胜利，犹如阳光，指引着在反压迫者斗争中的法国人民。指引着我们反对本国帝国主义政府对殖民地施行压迫手段的斗争。
    斯大林发扬光大了马克思恩格斯列宁理论以后，他给了我们日常斗争的一种武器。
    法国人民在他七十寿辰的日子，想以数百种礼物献给他。我们将向他说：对于我们亲爱的伟大的约瑟夫·斯大林同志，法国工人们的心是充满了热爱，感谢和尊敬的。我们要向他说：我们人民的志愿，是斗争到完全战胜我们国内的帝国主义为止。我们要向他说：为和平与为社会主义的战士们，正在全世界作着斗争；我们的志愿，就是参加到这些战士的行列中去。
    最后，我们还得向他说：我们永远是忠实于各民族间的国际主义的：约瑟夫·斯大林万岁！
