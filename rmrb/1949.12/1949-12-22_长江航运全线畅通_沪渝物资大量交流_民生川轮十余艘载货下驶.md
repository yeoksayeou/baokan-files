　　[This newspaper's dispatch] With the full opening of the Yangtze River shipping route between Chongqing and Shanghai, a large-scale exchange of goods between the two cities is now possible. Sichuan's specialty products, such as tung oil and bristles, will soon be shipped eastward to Shanghai for export, which will greatly contribute to stabilizing the economies of both cities. Currently, more than ten Minsheng Shipping Company vessels have sailed downriver from Chongqing. Among them, the "Yuanjiang," "Wujiang," "Tuojiang," "Zijiang," "Fujiang," "Xiangjiang," "Ganjiang," "Minjiang," and "Shenglin" vessels are sailing to Yichang, while the "Minlian" and "Minzu" vessels are sailing to Shanghai, carrying over 560 tons of tung oil, 300 tons of rapeseed oil, and over 80 pieces of bristles. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government is actively arranging for the transportation of goods to strengthen the exchange of goods between Shanghai and Chongqing. The Chongqing Military Control Commission has ordered a large quantity of cotton cloth from the Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, which has been shipped to Chongqing in batches.
