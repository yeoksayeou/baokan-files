　　Northeast China Factory Mines
　　Deeply Develop the Anti-Waste Movement
　　Mobilizing the Masses to Expose Wasteful Phenomena and Propose Rational Suggestions
　　[Report from this newspaper] Currently, while creating new records, factory mines in Northeast China are also universally launching mass movements to inspect waste. Under the leadership of the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee, the anti-waste movement in thirty-one state-owned factories and enterprises in Qiqihar City has already achieved great results. The Nenjiang Match Factory, Nenjiang Textile Factory, Qiqihar Flour Mill, and twelve other factories have begun to conduct democratic exposure. From the self-criticisms of the fifteen factory directors alone, waste amounting to 12 billion (currency not specified) was discovered. The movement is continuing to deepen. However, the inspections in various factories have mostly focused on consignment sales and general affairs departments, and have not yet paid sufficient attention to inspecting every detail of the production process. This point has attracted full attention from the leadership of each factory. The Songjiang Fengshan Coal Mine began on the 11th of last month, and in the past ten days, waste caused by poor management, material waste, and frozen funds amounted to a huge 2.59 billion yuan (Northeast currency). For example, the southern district of the mine newly opened three shafts, but due to inaccurate investigation, no coal was found after completion, resulting in great waste of manpower and financial resources. The northern district's coal unloading yard did not install electric lights, and lit several piles of coal fires every night for illumination, causing a fire and a loss of more than 120 tons of coal. In the process of checking waste, in addition to boldly exposing waste phenomena, the staff and workers of the mine also actively put forward various rational suggestions for improving work. The First Iron Factory under the Industry Department of the Songjiang Provincial Government found that it had wasted nearly 700 million yuan in the past year during the anti-waste movement. The main reason was that the leadership did not pay attention to and accept the workers' rational suggestions. Since the Xi'an Dongcheng Mine checked for waste, the workers' love for the mine and their enthusiasm for production have been greatly enhanced. The Communist Youth League members have launched a campaign to collect scrap iron. The mine has improved the method of drilling holes and increased the power of the cannons. Originally, one cannon could blast one meter deep, but now it can blast 1.2 meters, and work efficiency has been significantly improved. However, some factories have insufficient understanding of the importance of carrying out this movement, have failed to earnestly mobilize the masses, and have even generated resistance. The leadership at all levels has begun to pay attention to correcting this.

　　东北各地厂矿  
    深入展开反浪费运动
    发动群众揭发浪费现象提出合理建议
    【本报讯】目前东北各地厂矿与进行创造新纪录的同时，并普遍开展了群众性的检查浪费运动。齐齐哈尔市三十一个公营工厂和企业部门在市委领导下，反浪费运动已经获得很大成绩。嫩江火柴公司、嫩江纺织厂、齐齐哈尔火磨等十二个工厂都开始进行了民主揭发。仅仅从十五个厂厂长的检讨当中，就发现有一百二十个亿的浪费。现在运动在继续深入。但是各工厂的检查，多半是着重了代销、总务等方面，还没有很好的注意检查生产过程当中的每一个细节，这一点，已引起各厂领导上的充分注意。松江凤山煤矿从上月十一日开始进行，十天来查出因管理不善、材料浪费、资金冻结等原因造成的浪费达二十五亿九千万元（东北币，下同）之巨。如该矿南区曾新开了三个坑口，但因调查不确，结果开完了无煤，人力、财力浪费极大。北区卸煤场不按电灯，每夜点燃数堆煤火照亮，因之发生火灾，损失煤一百二十多吨。该矿在检查浪费中，职工除大胆地揭露了浪费现象外，并积极提出各种改进工作的合理建议。松江省府工业厅所属第一铁工厂在反浪费运动中，查出一年来共浪费近七亿元。主要原因是领导上不重视和接受工人的合理建议所致。西安东城矿自检查浪费后，职工们对矿山的爱护和生产积极性更加提高，青年团员们掀起检废铁运动，该矿由于改进了打眼方法，加大了炮的威力，原先一炮崩一米深，现在可崩一米二，工作效率显著提高。但有的厂对开展这一运动的重要性认识不足，未能认真发动群众，甚至产生对抗现象，现各领导上已开始注意纠正。
