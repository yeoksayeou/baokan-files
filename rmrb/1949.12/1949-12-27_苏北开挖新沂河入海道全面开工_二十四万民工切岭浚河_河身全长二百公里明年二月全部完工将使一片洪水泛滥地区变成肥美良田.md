The full-scale project to divert the Yi River to the sea, which will fundamentally solve the water conservancy problems in northern Jiangsu and transform 14 million mu of flood-prone areas into fertile farmland, began in late November. 250,000 laborers from nine counties, including Xin'an, Shuyang, Suqian, Siyang, Suining, PiSui, Lianshui, and Guanyun, have begun cutting ridges, dredging rivers, and building dikes to create a new channel to the sea, approximately 200 kilometers long, sufficient to discharge the upstream water volume of the Yi River.

The new Yishui River channel to the sea starts from Zhouzui in Xin'an County, passes east through Luoma Lake (Luoma Lake is a reservoir for the Yi River's downstream flow, which has been silted up), cuts through the four-kilometer-long Zhangshan and Maling ridges, passes through Shuyang County, and enters the sea at the Guanhekou in Guanyun County. The river channel is 500 meters to 2,500 meters wide, traversing the Mu River, Guantian River, Gang River, Wan Gong River, and Yan River. Sluice gates will be built at the intersections with each river to regulate water volume. Once this channel is completed, the riverbed can accommodate the maximum flood flow of the Yi River, 4,500 cubic meters per second. It can also discharge part of the Shuyang River's flow during normal times. This will transform a river that annually floods farmland and engulfs villages into one that serves the farmers. This massive project is scheduled for completion in mid-February of next year. The most challenging part of the entire project is the ridge-cutting work at Zhangshan and Maling.

Preparations for excavating the new Yishui River channel to the sea began in August of this year. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office dispatched a survey team of more than 200 people to repeatedly study the terrain, water flow, geology, and local residents' conditions. The selected route has the following advantages: (1) fewer people are affected, minimizing sacrifices; (2) the route is short, saving labor; (3) the soil along the route is mostly clay, suitable for building dikes; (4) most of the rainwater in the area can be naturally discharged into the river, and some areas can be used for silt deposition to improve soil quality. After the entire project was approved by the East China Financial and Economic Committee in October, Northern Jiangsu immediately established the Yi River and Mu River Management Project Headquarters to oversee the project's implementation. In early November, the CCP Northern Jiangsu District Committee, the Administrative Office, and the Military Region Headquarters jointly issued a general mobilization order for a large-scale water management campaign, calling on Party, government, military, and civilians to organize all forces and engage in this campaign with a fighting spirit. Counties along the river also successively convened meetings of cadres and mass rallies at the county, district, and township levels to arrange preparatory work for the river excavation. First, young and middle-aged people were mobilized to participate in the river excavation project, promoting the idea that river management is a prerequisite for building Northern Jiangsu and is an immortal cause for themselves and their descendants. This sparked enthusiastic challenges and competitions among counties. Coupled with the government's policy of repairing the river to provide disaster relief and employing people as a form of relief, young and middle-aged people in various counties in the Huaiyin region actively participated in the river excavation work. The Northern Jiangsu New Democratic Youth League specifically established an Yi River and Mu River Management Work Committee to lead the League members participating in the river excavation work, unite the vast number of young men and women to strive to complete this arduous project, and plan to recruit one-quarter to one-third of the young laborers as League members. Subsequently, each county mobilized more than 10,000 households of residents in the new riverbed to relocate. They put forward slogans such as "Temporary trouble, eternal happiness for future generations," and "One family cannot outweigh ten thousand families, and ten thousand families will never shortchange one family," reminding relocating households to consider the long-term and overall interests. Due to the active leadership of Communist Party members and Youth League members, many residents in nearby villages were able to vacate their houses to welcome the relocating households to borrow, and helped them find good foundations to prepare for building new houses. The government also allocated 10.13 million catties of grain to be distributed to each relocating household as subsidies for building houses. This made the relocating farmers realize that in the new society, "Moving homes is not afraid of unfamiliar places, because there are relatives wherever you move." Preparations for the river excavation were completed on schedule in mid-November.

Excavating the new Yishui River is only part of the Northern Jiangsu water conservancy project plan. The water conservancy plan is divided into three parts and completed in three phases. The first phase is the Yi River diversion project. The second phase is the Mu River management, which will begin in the winter of next year and will also require mobilizing 300,000 laborers. The third phase is water management and land reclamation on the coast, repairing river embankments and canal embankments. These three great water management projects will fundamentally solve the increasingly serious water disasters in northern Jiangsu, enabling the Huaiyin region to increase grain production by 600 million catties annually, and improve soil quality and increase millions of mu of cotton fields in coastal areas. The first phase of the project alone will cost 200 million catties of grain. In today's extremely difficult government financial situation, for the welfare of the people, the East China People's Government at all levels will still pay for it from the streamlined and saved grain.

　　苏北开挖新沂河入海道全面开工
　  二十四万民工切岭浚河
    河身全长二百公里明年二月全部完工将使一片洪水泛滥地区变成肥美良田
    嶂山以陵断麓切岭工程艰巨
    八月开始准备选择优良河道
    挖河是建设大事青壮年踊跃参加
    【本报讯】使一千四百万亩洪水泛滥的水灾地区变为五谷丰登的良田，从根本上解决苏北水利问题的导沂工程，已于十一月下旬全面开工。新安、沭阳、宿迁、泗阳、睢宁、邳睢、涟水、灌云等九县民工二十五万人已开始切岭、浚河、筑堤，为沂河开挖长约二百公里，足够宣泄上流水量的新入海道。
    新沂河入海道，起自新安县之周咀，经骆马湖东行（骆马湖为沂河止游的蓄水池，已被淤平），切开长四公里的嶂山马陵断麓，过沭阳县，至灌云县之灌河口入海。河身宽五百公尺到二千五百公尺，横贯了沐河、官田河、港河、万公河、盐河，与各河交汇处皆筑闸调节水量。此入海道扒成后，河漕内可容纳沂河最大洪水流量四千五百秒立方公尺。平时又可宣泄沭河水流的一部。将使这年年淹没农田，吞食村庄的河流为农民服役。这一巨大的工程将于明年二月中旬完工。在全部工程中，最艰巨的是嶂山马陵断麓的切岭工程。
    开挖新沂河入海道的准备工作，于今年八月即已开始，苏北行署曾派出二百余人的勘测队，反复研究了地形、水势、地质及居民情况。被选择的路线有以下几个优点：（一）人烟较少，牺牲小。（二）路线短，省工。（三）沿线多为黏土，适于筑堤。（四）流经地区雨水大部可自然畅泄入河，部分地区又可放淤改良土质。全部工程于十月间经华东财委会批准后，苏北随即成立导沂整沐工程司令部，指挥工程的进行。十一月旬，中共苏北区党委、行署、军区司令部联合发出大治水运动总动员令，号召党政军民以战斗的精神组织一切力量投入这一运动中去。沿河各县也先后召开了县区乡各级干部及群众大会。布置开河的准备工作。首先动员青壮年参加挖河工程，宣传治河是建设苏北的先决条件，是为自己为子孙永垂不朽的事业。因而掀起各县区间热烈的挑战竞赛，更加上政府实施修河救灾，以工代赈的政策，使准阴区各县青壮年均能踊跃参加挖河工作。苏北新民主主义青年团，特成立导沂整沐工作委员会，领导参加挖河工作的团员，团结广大青年男女为完成这一艰巨的工程而努力，并计划吸收青年民工的四分之一到三分之一为团员。随后各县就动员新河床内一万余户居民搬家。提出“一时麻烦，子孙亨福”，，“一家不百万家事，万家决不亏一家”等口号，提醒搬家户要为长远的整体的利益打算。由于共产党员及青年团员积极带头领导，附近村庄的许多居民也都能腾出房子来，欢迎搬家户去借住，并帮助他们找好地基准备盖新房子，政府也拨粮一千零一十三万斤发给各搬家户，作为盖房子的补帖金。使搬家农民体会到，新社会真是“搬家不怕地方生，搬到那里那里有亲人”。挖河准备工作随于十一月中旬如期完成。
    开挖新沂河，仅是苏北水利工程计划的一部分。该水利计划共分三部，分为三期完成。第一期即导沂工程。第二期为整沐，将于明年冬季开始，也需要动员民工三十万人。第三期是在海边治水兴垦，修整江堤及运河堤。这三期伟大的治水工程，将根本解决年年加剧的苏北水患，使淮阴区域每年能增产六亿斤粮食，并在沿海地区改良土质，增加数百万亩棉田。计第一期工程即需费粮食两亿斤。在政府财政极其困难的今日，为人民的福利，化东各级人民政府仍将从精简节约的粮食中支付之。
