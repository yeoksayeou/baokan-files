Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: According to a TASS dispatch: While Soviet working people are engaged in selfless labor to strive for the early completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan, they are enjoying the fruits of their labor, and their welfare is constantly improving.

Currently, many new cities are being built in the Soviet Union, thousands of villages are being rebuilt, and many schools, cultural centers, kindergartens, nurseries, and hospitals are under construction. In the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, approximately 51 million square meters of living space have been rebuilt and restored in cities, villages, and workers' residences. The state has allocated large sums for the construction of worker housing. This year alone, the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry has spent 1.2 billion rubles, the Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry 617 million rubles, and the Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing 142.2 million rubles. This has enabled Soviet miners to move into 30,000 new apartments, steel workers into 16,000 new apartments, and heavy machinery manufacturing workers into more than 3,000 new apartments. The installation of gas equipment in residences is also increasing. In Moscow, more than 2 million residents now have access to gas. The use of gas has saved the people of Moscow more than 200 million rubles.

The healthcare of Soviet workers is also constantly improving. This year, Soviet trade unions have allocated 22 million rubles to build new sanatoriums and rest homes. In addition to the large number of health stations belonging to the Ministry of Public Health, trade unions have also funded the establishment of 760 health stations nationwide. Many new health stations, tuberculosis sanatoriums, rheumatism and stomach disease sanatoriums are being established in scenic seaside and forest areas. These new health stations all have their own dairy farms, livestock farms, orchards, and vegetable gardens. Sanatoriums and rest homes are generally equipped with medical departments, clubs, sports fields, solariums, and beaches.

Tens of thousands of working people spend their holidays in these sanatoriums and health stations. During the holidays, they continue to receive wages from their respective industrial sectors.

Soviet trade unions also pay meticulous attention to the health of workers during their labor. For example, the Industrial Welfare Research Institute of the Central Council of Soviet Trade Unions specifically studied safety technology and ways to make the working conditions of female textile workers healthier this year. It recommended the use of hot water flax spinning, which can protect the hands of textile workers from damage. New equipment to remove dust from the air is also being recommended in the carding shops of cotton mills and flax mills.

Soviet trade unions also attach great importance to carrying out political education among the working people and satisfying their growing cultural needs. For example, the Zaporozhye Steel Combine has spent more than 170,000 rubles on cultural work. There are two clubs and forty-one reading rooms in this factory, as well as three standard canteens. This year, the trade union has funded the sending of 302 people to recuperation centers and 677 people to rest homes. The factory committee has also spent 500,000 rubles on Young Pioneer camps.

　　享受战后五年计划劳动果实
  　苏劳动人民福利不断提高
    政府拨出巨款兴建大批工人住宅　保健事业及文化工作正逐渐增进
    【新华社北京十三日电】综合塔斯社消息：与苏联劳动人民为争取提前完成战后五年计划而进行忘我劳动的同时，他们正享受着自己劳动的果实，他们的福利正不断提高。
    现在，苏联许多新城市正在兴建起来，上千的村庄正在重建，许多学校、文化之家、幼稚园、保育院和医院正在建筑中。在五年计划的头三年中，在城市、乡村和工人住宅中，已重建和恢复了约五千一百万平方公尺的居住面积。国家在兴建工人房屋方面拨出了大批款项。今年一年中，苏联煤矿工业部已支出十二亿卢布，钢铁工业部六亿一千七百万卢布，重型机器制造部一亿四千二百万卢布。这样使苏联的矿工迁入了三万所新公寓，钢铁工人迁入一万六千座新公寓，重型机器制造工人迁入三千多所新公寓。住宅中的煤气设备也在增加着，在莫斯科，现在已有二百多万居民有煤气使用。由于煤气的使用，使莫斯科人民节省了两亿多卢布。
    苏联工人的保健事业也在不断改进，苏联工会在今年已拨出二千二百万卢布来建设新疗养院和休息所。除了公共卫生部所属的大量保健站之外，工会还在全国出资开办了七百六十所保健站。许多新的保健站、结核病疗养院、风湿病和胃病疗养院，正在风景优美的海边和树林中建立起来。这些新的保健站都有自己的牛奶场、家畜饲养场、果园和菜园。疗养院和休息所大都有医药部、俱乐部、运动场、日光浴室和海滩等设备。
    成千成万的劳动人民在这些疗养院和保健站里渡过假期。在假期间照旧能从其所属的工业部门得到工资。
    苏联工会对工人劳动时的健康的关心也无微不至。例如，苏联工会中央理事会的工业福利研究所，今年曾专门研究安全技术及使纺织女工的劳动条件较为健康的问题，建议使用热水亚麻纺织法，这种方法能保护纺织工人的手不致损害。在轧棉厂和亚麻纺织工厂的梳棉场，清除空气中灰尘的新设备也正在被推荐中。
    苏联工会也非常重视在劳动人民中进行政治教育工作和满足他们日益增涨的文化需要。例如，萨波罗什制钢组合就已在文化工作上支出了十七万余卢布。在这工厂里共有两个俱乐部和四十一间阅览室，有三所标准食堂。今年由工会出资送往休养地的有三○二人，送往休养所的有六七七人。工厂委员会并为少年先锋队营支出了五十万卢布。
