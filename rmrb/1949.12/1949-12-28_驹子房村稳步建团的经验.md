　　Experiences in Steadily Establishing the Communist Youth League in Komuzifang Village
　　Special Correspondent for this newspaper, Aiding

　　Komuzifang Village in the eastern suburbs of Beijing is a new area. The impact of the Kuomintang reactionary government's large-scale conscription of young people still lingers in the minds of the peasants. The young people and their parents both have a "fear of conscription" mentality.

　　Young peasant farmers have a very close relationship with their families. Parents hope their children will learn well and fear they will be led astray by others. They also fear that mixing men and women will damage the family reputation. They only feel at ease when their children's every move passes through them.

　　Here, the Communist Youth League is relatively new. Peasants often talk about what the Communist Party is like and what the People's Liberation Army is like, but they have never heard of the Communist Youth League.

　　When establishing the League under these circumstances, our first step was to pay attention to publicity work. We used various large and small meetings during the land reform to publicize the Communist Youth League, telling the peasants what the League does—unite and educate young people, help them learn well and make progress, and serve the people. The League is led by the Communist Party and supports all its propositions, such as land reform, fighting local tyrants, helping poor people to turn over a new leaf, and taking the lead in production. What does the League oppose? It opposes eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and idleness. And we explained the conditions for joining the League. In this way, the masses gradually understood the League and eliminated the ideological concerns of "fear of conscription" and "fear of learning bad habits." At the same time, we held youth forums and meetings for activists. In addition to general publicity about land reform policies, we also talked about the League. Some people raised questions such as "Who can join the League?" and "Can I join the League?" Then we clearly announced that the League is a mass organization of progressive young people, different from the Youth Federation. League members must work hard in production, actively participate in land reform, be active in their work, have a correct style, and be selfless. We further explained that the League has a life, an organization, and discipline. This made the youth understand that only by working hard and meeting the conditions could they join the League.

　　Such forums can be held appropriately more times. At the same time, appropriate work should be given to cultivate mature activists to train them. These activists generally perform very well. They take the lead in class division and expose the destructive activities of landlords. They also publicize the nature and tasks of the League everywhere and provide materials to the work team, enabling the League's activities to be carried out more widely.

　　Afterwards, we further improved the work of the youth's families by holding forums for youth family members, explaining League affairs in simple terms, such as the League educating the younger generation to take the right path. We explained that the marriage policy is based on mutual consent between men and women, opposing arranged marriages and incorrect relationships between men and women. We explained that only good young people can join the League, and joining the League is an honor. These are in line with their desire for their children to learn well. Some actively publicize the benefits of the League and encourage their children to join. They say, "You learn to be good by following good people, and you learn to be a witch by following a witch!"

　　Some villages have not done a good job of working with the youth's families, which has added trouble to the establishment of the League. For example, in Balizhuang, many League members' family members still suspect that joining the League means being drafted into the army. One family member handed the application form for joining the League to the person in charge and said, "My son is foolish, don't let him participate, don't let anything go wrong."

　　The masses are also very concerned about the League. At a farmers' association meeting, thirteen people applied to join the League. Everyone discussed on the spot and raised opinions on the applicants. For example, someone said, "Ding Lian meets the conditions, but he has a small problem. He takes small advantages when watching crops, and he likes to throw tantrums with his father." On the day of the League joining ceremony, more than 600 people from the entire village's farmers' association, women's association, young men and women, and primary school teachers and students participated. At the meeting, the farmers' association representative raised opinions on the League members, hoping that the League members would "actively participate in land reform, and take the lead in production after land reform." The family members' representative said that they felt honored that their children had joined the League and hoped that the League would conduct good education to make the children good League members.

　　The establishment of the League in Komuzifang adopts the principle of steady development. It is necessary to establish the League's foundation well, erect the League's glorious banner, point out the League's correct path, and make the League stand firmly among the masses, gradually growing from small to large. The first batch of thirty-five people was approved; another four were temporarily not approved and will continue to be examined; those who are not yet very active in their work are prepared to be studied in the second batch. Currently, we are paying special attention to the relationship between the League and the masses, educating League members to serve the masses. The day after the oath was taken, one League member said, "Don't just read it (referring to the oath) and then disperse. We must do it this way!"

　　驹子房村稳步建团的经验
    本报特约通讯员  艾丁
    北京东郊驹子房村是新区，国民党反动政府大量抓捕青年当兵的影响还留在农民的心里，青年们和他们的家长，都存在着“怕当兵”的思想。
    青年农民与家庭的关系非常密切，父母希望儿女学好，怕被别人引坏，又怕男女混杂破坏门风，孩子的一举一动，都要通过他们才放心。
    在这里，团是比较新鲜的。农民常说到共产党怎样，解放军怎样，但对于青年团，他们从没听说过。
    在这种情况下建团，我们第一步注意了宣传工作。利用土地改革中各种大小会上，宣传青年团，告诉农民，团是干什么的——团结教育青年群众，使他们学好、学进步，为人民服务；团是共产党领导的，拥护共产党的一切主张，如土地改革，斗争恶霸，帮助穷人翻身，带头生产等；团反对什么？反对吃喝嫖赌，游手好闲等。并说明入团的条件。这样，群众逐渐认识了团，消除了“怕当兵”，“怕学坏样”等思想顾虑。同时，我们召开青年座谈会、积极分子会，除了作土地改革政策等一般宣传外，再谈到团，有人提出了“什么人才能入团？”“我能入团不？”等问题，于是再明确宣布，团是进步青年的群众组织，他与青年联合会不同，团员必须努力生产，积极参加土地改革，工作积极，作风正派，大公无私。再说明团的生活，团是有组织的，有纪律的。这样使青年明了只有努力工作，够条件才能入团。
    这样的座谈会可以适当地多开几次；与此同时，要给培养成熟的积极分子以适当工作，借以锻炼他们。这些积极分子一般表现很好，他们带头划阶级，揭发地主的破坏活动；并到处宣传团的性质和任务，又供给工作组材料，使团的活动更广泛开展。
    随后，再进一步做好青年家属的工作，召开青年家属座谈会，浅显地讲解团的事情，如团是教育青年一代走正路的；讲婚姻政策是在男女双方自愿基础上结合，反对包办，反对不正确的男女关系。说明好青年才能入团，入团是光荣的。这些正符合他们希望儿女学好的要求，有的便积极宣传团的好处，鼓励儿女入团，他们说：“跟着好人学好人，跟着巫婆会下神！”
    有的村对青年家属工作没有作好，对建团添了麻烦。如八里庄不少团员家属还怀疑着是否入了团就要当兵，有一个家属把申请入团志愿书交给负责人说：“我儿傻，别叫他参加，别出什么错误。”
    群众对团也很关心，在一次农会会上，有十三人申请入团，当场大家讨论，对申请入团的人提意见，如有人说：“丁连够条件，可是有个小毛病，看青时占小便宜，又好跟他爹耍脾气。”在举行入团仪式的一天，全村农会、妇会、青年男女、小学师生等六百多人来参加。在会上，农会代表对团员提意见，希望团员“积极参加土改，土改后要带头生产。”家属代表表示子女入团感到光荣，希望团好好地进行教育，使孩子成为好团员。
    驹子房建团是采取稳步发展的原则，要扎好团的根子、竖立起团的光荣旗帜，指明团的正确道路，使团稳固地站在群众当中，逐渐由小到大，首次批准了三十五人；另有四名暂未批准，继续进行考查；对工作还不十分积极的则准备到第二批再研究之。目前，我们特别注意搞好团与群众的关系，教育团员为群众服务。在宣誓后的第二天，一个团员说：“别光念了（指誓词）就散啦，得按这样办哩！”
