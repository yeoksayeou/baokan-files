  　Remarkable Achievements in Grain and Coal Retail
    [Beijing News] Beijing Municipality has strengthened its grain and coal retail work and has achieved remarkable results. As of the 3rd of this month, 150 grain retail stores have been established. After investigation by the police stations in each district, citizen grain purchase certificates were issued on the 1st of this month. In the past three days, 162,000 grain purchase certificates have been issued, and grain purchases based on certificates have now begun. Each person can purchase 30 jin of grain per month with a certificate. On the 1st of this month, the retail stores sold a total of 260,700+ jin of grain in one day. This has played a significant role in grain supply and grain price management. The number of coal briquette retail shops (i.e., coal and iron company processors) in the city has reached 153, and it is planned to continue to increase the number in order to provide coal to citizens universally. The procedure for citizens to purchase coal is based on the household registration booklet, with each person calculated at 4 jin of coal per day, and each purchase can be for five days' worth of coal. The price of coal briquettes is 1,000 to 1,500 yuan lower per 100 jin than the market price, and the quality of the coal is generally reported to be very good, with purchasers being very enthusiastic. From the 24th of last month to the 3rd of this month, the city's coal briquette retail shops have sold 869 tons of coal briquettes. Although the grain and coal retail work has been widely launched, some technical problems, such as the incomplete variety of grains in grain retail stores and coal briquettes not being dry enough, still need to be improved.

  　粮煤零售成绩显著
    【北京讯】北京市加强粮煤零售工作，已获显著成绩。截至本月三日止，粮食零售店已建立了一百五十处，市民购粮证经各区派出所调查后，已于本月一日发下。三日来共发出购粮证十六万二千份，现已开始凭证购粮。每人每月可凭证购粮三十斤。本月一日各零售店一天即销售粮食二十六万零七百余斤。在粮食供应和管理粮价方面，起了相当作用。全市煤球零售铺（即煤铁公司加工户），已达一百五十三户，仍拟继续增加，以普遍供应市民燃煤。市民购煤手续是凭户口单，每人每日以四斤煤计算，每次可买五天的煤。煤球价格每百斤较市价低一千元至一千五百元，煤质一般反映很好，购买者十分踊跃。自上月二十四日至本月三日止。全市煤球零售铺已售出煤球八百六十九吨。粮煤零售工作，虽已普遍展开，但有些技术问题，如粮食零售店粮种不全；煤球不够八成干等，尚须继续改进。
