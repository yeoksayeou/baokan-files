Folk Songs
　　Jiang Dongchi

    I.

    Little boy, not naughty,
    Mommy is weaving flowered cloth for me.
    Mommy says:
    When the flowered cloth is woven to one zhang,
    A little outfit will be made for my little self.
    When a bolt of white cloth is woven,
    Army uniforms will be made for my brothers.

    Little boy, not naughty,
    Daddy is farming and planting for me.
    Daddy says:
    If the grain yield is ninety-nine shi,
    We'll buy a big yellow ox.
    If the grain yield is thirteen shi,
    The public grain will be sent to the south of the Yangtze River.

    II.

    Red jujubes, yellow pears,
    Under the tree sits a little girl,
    Head down, hands not idle,
    Embroidering peonies on a colorful handkerchief.
    The peony flowers are so fresh,
    With strings of words beside them,
    Stitch by stitch, back and forth,
    Embroidering a handkerchief to send to loved ones.
    Want to know who the loved ones are?
    Embroidered on it: "People's Liberation Army."

    III.

    The rooster crows "cock-a-doodle-doo,"
    Our family has houses and land.
    The government tells us to produce well.
    Dad says, "When things are good, I'll get you a wife."
    The hen flaps its wings,
    Dad and Mom go to the fields,
    Grandma makes meals and steams buns,
    Older sister spins a bobbin of thread,
    Sister-in-law weaves flowered cloth,
    Mom tells me to study hard,
    "When you grow up, work for the people."

　　民歌
    江东池
    一、
　
    小小子，不淘气，
    妈妈给俺织花布
    妈妈说：
    花布织一丈
    给俺小小做衣裳
    白布织一匹
    给哥哥他们做军衣。
　
    小小子，不淘气，
    爸爸给俺养种地
    爸爸说：
    粮打九石九
    买头大黄牛
    粮打十石三
    公粮送到长江南。
　
  　二、
　
    红红枣，黄黄梨
    树棵底下坐着个小闺女，
    头不抬，手不闲
    花花手巾绣牡丹
    牡丹花，好新鲜
    旁边字儿一串串，
    针针倒，倒倒针，
    绣块手巾送亲人
    要问亲人是那个？
    上绣：“人民解放军。”
　
　　三、
　
    公鸡打鸣咯咯＠
    俺家有了房子有了地
    政府叫俺好好生产
    爸说：“过好了给俺娶媳妇。”
    黎鸡打翅
    爸爸妈妈下地
    奶奶做饭蒸饼子
    姐姐纺个穗，
    嫂嫂织花布
    妈妈叫我好好念书，
    “大了，给老百姓办事。”
