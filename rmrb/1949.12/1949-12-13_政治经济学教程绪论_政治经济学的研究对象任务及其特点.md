Political Economy Tutorial Introduction

　　The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy Study
    Section 2: The Historical Development and Predictive Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    For example, vulgar bourgeois political economists, especially the American vulgar school, also try their best to cover up the periodic economic panics that repeatedly break out in capitalist society, and deny the inevitability of the outbreak of panics in capitalist society. At first, they stubbornly denied that capitalist economies would experience panics. Later, as panics continued to break out periodically, they were forced to admit it, but they only admitted it to a limited extent, refusing to acknowledge the periodicity of capitalist economic panics. They only considered it an accidental phenomenon, not a periodically recurring one. It wasn't until after the First World War, when world capitalism entered a general crisis, and the world economic crisis of 1929-1930 erupted on an unprecedented scale, that the stagnation of the market, the deepening of the crisis, the large-scale bankruptcy of factories and banks, and the large-scale, widespread, and long-term existence of unemployment became impossible for the bourgeoisie and bourgeois economists to cover up or defend, given the enormous productive forces of capitalism. Faced with this impending total collapse, they were alarmed and at a loss, and Sir Keynes, a director of the Bank of England, a decision-maker on economic policy for the British Empire, and an economist of the neo-classical school, came forward to acknowledge the existence and deepening of cyclical crises in capitalist economies. However, they still did not recognize Marx's view of the cyclical crisis of capitalism existing in the fundamental contradiction of capitalist production, nor did they recognize Lenin's view of the general crisis of capitalism. Keynes only believed that there was an imbalance in the capitalist system, and that this imbalance worsened with the growth of capitalism. This imbalance stemmed from the growth trend of capital "savings" (i.e., capital accumulation). The growth of capital accumulation resulted in the inability to find favorable investment markets, which in turn led to periodic economic crises and massive increases in unemployment. Bourgeois economists downplayed this crisis, calling it "industrial fluctuations." They suggested that the British and American bourgeois governments use the power of the bourgeois state to intervene, encouraging capitalists to invest in order to bridge the gap between production and consumption, put factories back into operation, weaken the massive increase in unemployment, create so-called "full employment" opportunities, and overcome this serious crisis that capitalism itself could not overcome. They attempted to overcome the general crisis of capitalism by basically eliminating the economic crises of individual capitalist countries. They attempted to rescue the capitalist system from its increasingly deepening general crisis, and wanted to strengthen the capitalist economic system to save it from its increasingly approaching death. Therefore, Sir Keynes's proposals became the main basis for the economic theories and economic policies of the large and medium-sized bourgeoisie within the recent American and British imperialism and their domestic fascist rule, the implementation of imperialist expansion policies, and the so-called "progressive capitalism" bottom reform policy. Keynes's theory became the main theory of bourgeois economics in the imperialist era of American and British imperialist countries. In the semi-colonial China under the past Chiang-American rule, it was also popular for a time and became a fashionable learning.
    Due to their selfish class nature and starting from their subjective desire to exploit, bourgeois political economists eulogize the development and prosperity of capitalism, and even more shamelessly promote the long-term prosperity of the capitalist economy and the permanent existence of the capitalist system, boasting that it is the most ideal and civilized way of life for mankind. However, these statements obviously do not conform to the realistic capitalist economic facts and the realistic capitalist economic movement. Even if they are forced to admit certain facts, they still have to cover them up and downplay them in order to conceal the truth and carry out deception. However, the realistic capitalist economic facts and the realistic capitalist economic movement completely prove that these statements of bourgeois political economics are nothing more than a set of self-deceiving lies. It can only show the incompetence and powerlessness of bourgeois political economists in understanding economic phenomena, and show the short-sighted, superficial, distorted, and deceptive and paralyzing characteristics of them and their theories. Because no matter how bourgeois political economists want to explain some economic phenomena in capitalist society with the view of the permanent existence of the capitalist economy, the objective economic facts that constantly occur in capitalist society are contrary to their subjective wishes, and give their ideas and theories a ruthless blow and shattering, revealing their embarrassment and decline. Because the objectively existing economic phenomena are completely moving and developing away from the subjective wishes of our bourgeois political economists and the direction they fantasize about, and are not running according to their will and wishes.
    China's bourgeois political economists can only follow suit and peddle some imported goods from Europe and the United States. Like the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of the old Chinese society, most of them serve the imperialists and the bureaucratic capital of China's compradors and large banks, some serve the Japanese-German-Italian fascists and traitors (such as Dr. Li Quanshi and his ilk), and some serve the American imperialists. But no matter who their foreign masters are, what they are touting and peddling, they have a common feature, that is, they are anti-communist, anti-people, anti-Marxist, and anti-Marxist-Leninist. However, their theories and doctrines are fragile, powerless, and superficial. For example, in the past, they could not see clearly or explain what the nature of the modern Chinese economy was, or their understanding was vague and ambiguous. They believed that the Chinese economy did not belong to any nature—if it was said to be a capitalist economy, there were still some feudal remnants; if it was said to be a feudal economy, there were still capitalist elements. Therefore, during the nationwide debate on the nature of Chinese social economy that occurred between our party and the Trotskyite bandits before the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese bourgeois political economists could only stand by and remain silent. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the rear area under the rule of the Kuomintang, due to the reduction of production, the @ levy was vast, inflation, hoarding, speculation, and the difficulty of transportation, and the cut-off of foreign commodity sources, prices soared. Among our vulgar bourgeois economists, some could not explain these reasons, and some even shamelessly believed that the soaring prices were caused by excessive wages. These are reflections of the vulgar bourgeois economics of various capitalist countries in China, and at the same time, they also illustrate the incompetence and anti-scientific nature of vulgar economics. They are obviously reflections of the insatiable bourgeois consciousness. But it is regrettable that since they were born in China, they could not represent the national bourgeoisie to oppose the bureaucratic capital, but instead became tools of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, representing the interests of the imperialist bureaucratic bourgeoisie to open the knife to the working class, and become accomplices of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, wanting to scrape more oil and water from the Chinese working class to enrich them and themselves. In addition to this, among China's bourgeois political economists, there is also a part that, under the long-term reactionary rule of the imperialist Kuomintang, due to the impact of the upsurge of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, especially due to the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, is politically tending to or accepting new democracy, and also directly participating in the people's democratic revolution, and gradually accepting Marxism-Leninism in ideology and theory, or is willing to abandon the viewpoints of bourgeois political economics and transform into Marxist-Leninist political economists.

　　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第二节马列主义政治经济学的历史性发展性与预见性
    又如庸俗派资产阶级政治经济学者，尤其是美国的庸俗派，对于资本主义社会所不断反复爆发的周期性经济恐慌，也都极力掩盖，否认恐慌爆发在资本主义社会的必然性。他们开头强辩，不承认资本主义经济会发生恐慌，以后恐慌连续不断周期地爆发，他们被迫不得不承认，可是他们还只是有限度的承认，不肯承认资本主义经济恐慌的周期性，他们只认为这是偶然的现象，不是周期性反复发生的现象。一直到第一次世界大战后，世界资本主义进入总危机和一九二九至一九三○年世界经济危机以空前的规模爆发出来。由于在资本主义庞大的生产力下，市场停滞，危机深刻化，工厂银行大批倒闭，失业人口大量普遍长期地存在，资产阶级与资产阶级经济学者实在已无法掩盖，也无法辩解。他们对于这面临着的总崩溃局面，惊惶失措，乃以英格兰银行董事，大英帝国经济政策的决策者，新古典学派经济家凯恩斯爵士出而承认资本主义经济周期性危机的存在和深刻化。但他们仍然不承认马克思关于资本主义周期性危机存在于资本主义生产的基本矛盾的观点，也不承认列宁关于资本主义总危机的观点。凯恩斯只认为资本主义制度中存在着一种不平衡，这种不平衡随着资本主义的成长而愈益恶化，这种不平衡根源于资本“储蓄”（即资本积蓄）的增长趋势，资本积蓄的增长造成再不能寻觅有利的投资市场，结果遂发生周期性的经济危机和大量增长的失业。资产阶级经济学者把这种危机又轻描淡写，把它叫做“工业波动”他们建议英美资产阶级政府运用资产阶级国家的力量，采取干涉的方式，鼓励资本家投资，以弥补生产与消费间的脱节，使工厂开工，以削弱失业的大量增长，造成所谓“充分就业”的机会，来克服这种严重的资本主义本身所不可克服的危机。他们企图用基本上消灭个别资本主义国家的经济危机来克服资本主义总危机，他们企图把资本主义制度从它愈益深刻化的总危机中解救出来，他想加强资本主义的经济制度来挽救它愈益接近死亡的命运。因此凯恩斯爵士的献策成了挽近美英帝国主义国内大中资产阶级经济理论经济政策的与它们对内实行法西斯统治，对外实行帝国主义扩张政策以及所谓“进步的资本主义”底改良政策的主要根据，凯恩斯理论便成为帝国主义时期美英帝国主义国家资产阶级经济学的主要理论。在过去蒋美统治下的半殖民地中国也曾风靡一时，成为时髦学问。
    资产阶级政治经济学者由于他们自私自利的阶级本质，从他们剥削阶级的主观愿望出发，他们歌颂资本主义的发达与繁荣，并且更无耻地宣传什么资本主义经济的长期繁荣，与资本主义制度的永久长存，并吹嘘什么它是人类最理想最文明的生活方式，可是这些说法，显然是与现实的资本主义经济事实，现实的资本主义经济运动，丝毫没有符合的地方的。即使被迫不得已而承认了某些事实，可是还要遮遮掩掩，轻描淡写，以图掩盖事实的真相，来进行欺骗。但现实的资本主义经济事实，现实的资本主义经济运动，完全证明了资产阶级政治经济学的这些说法，无非是一派自欺欺人的谎言，它只能表现出资产阶级政治经济学者对于经济现象认识的无能与无力，表现出他们与他们学说的短视浅薄歪曲曲解与欺骗麻醉的特质。因为无论资产阶级政治经济学者怎样想拿资本主义经济永久化的观点来解释资本主义社会的一些经济现象，但资本主义社会所不断发生的客观经济事实，都与他们的主观愿望相反，对他们的理念和理论一一给了无情的打击与粉碎，显露了它们的狼狈与破落。因为客观存在的经济现象，完全是离开我们资产阶级政治经济学者的主观愿望与他们所幻想的方向而运动发展着，并不是按照他们的意志愿望而运行的。
    中国的资产阶级政治经济学者，都只能依样卖葫芦，贩卖一些欧美的舶来品。他们象旧中国社会的半殖民地半封建性质一样，他们之中大部分为帝国主义者与中国大买办大银行的官僚资本服务，有些为日德意法西斯与汉奸卖国贼服务（如李权时博士之流），也有的为美帝国主义者服务。但是不论他们外国主子是谁，他们所标榜贩卖的又是什么，它们却有一个共同的特点，便是反共反人民，反马克思主义，反马列主义，然而他们理论与学说却脆弱无力与肤浅无能，例如他们过去对于近代中国的经济究竟是什么性质的经济，他们没有人看得清，也没有人说明得了，或者认识模糊，模棱两可，他们认为中国经济不知道属于什么性质——说它是资本主义经济吧，却还有些封建残余的成分，说它是封建经济吧，却还有资本主义的成分。因此，抗战以前我们党与托派匪徒间所发生的全国性的关于中国社会经济性质的论战，中国资产阶级政治经济学者只能袖手旁观，默不作声。抗战时期在国民党统治下的大后方，由于生产减缩，＠征浩繁，通货膨胀，囤积居奇，投机倒把，以及交通困难，外来商品来源断绝，因此促使物价飞涨，我们庸俗的资产阶级经济学者中，有的不能拿这些原因来加以说明，有的竟然无耻地认为物价飞涨是由于工资过高所引起，这些本是资本主义各国庸俗派资产阶级经济学在中国的反映，同时，也说明了庸俗派经济学的无能与反科学性。他们显然是贪得无厌的资产阶级意识的反映。但是不能不引为遗憾的，他们生在中国既不能去代表民族资产阶级来反对官僚资本，却相反地成为官僚资产阶级的工具，代表帝国主义官僚资产阶级的利益来向工人阶级开刀，为大地主大资产阶级帮凶，想从中国工人阶级身上多刮一些油水，来肥壮他们与他们自己。除此以外，中国的资产阶级政治经济学者中，还有一部分，在长期帝国主义国民党的反动统治下，由于中国人民民主革命运动高潮的影响冲激，特别是由于中国人民解放战争的胜利，在政治上是趋向或接受新民主主义的，并也有直接地参加人民民主革命，且在思想理论上逐渐接受马列主义，或愿意放弃资产阶级政治经济学的观点，而转变为马列主义政治经济学者的。
