Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, Moscow: Prominent representatives of Soviet scientific and cultural circles gathered at the All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries on the 13th to hear L. Dubrovin, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Federation, report on the Soviet delegation's visit to China. The audience was very interested in this detailed report. Dubrovin said: "We stayed in China for thirty-five days and received indelible impressions. I was deeply moved by the heroic Chinese people who have been selflessly, bravely, and resolutely fighting for national independence for twenty-two years. Our Soviet delegation met with the Chinese people during the days of celebrating victory and the founding of the People's Republic."

Dubrovin recounted the Soviet delegation's visits to liberated Chinese cities and villages, as well as numerous meetings with workers, farmers, students, and intellectuals. She emphasized that the living standards of the Chinese working class have improved, and the peasants, who make up the vast majority of the population, have begun to acquire land—these are the preliminary achievements of the young People's Republic of China.

Dubrovin pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong enjoy great prestige among the people. Under his leadership, the Chinese people have achieved great epoch-making victories.

In the second part of her report, Dubrovin detailed the numerous instances in which the Chinese people expressed their sincere love and friendship for the powerful Soviet people, for the great friend of the Chinese people, and for the leader of all progressive mankind, Stalin. Dubrovin said: "We participated in many gatherings, with tens of thousands of people in attendance, sometimes even hundreds of thousands. Everywhere we heard such words as: The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is invincible and forever consolidated." Dubrovin concluded: "For this great feeling that the Chinese people have for the multinational Soviet Union, we can answer with the words of the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky: Extend your hand, let us be friends forever, the laboring China of hundreds of millions!"

After Dubrovin's report, she answered many questions about the education system, art, literature, science, and industrial development of the young People's Republic of China.

    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学和文化界的杰出代表十三日在全苏对外文化协会集会，听取俄罗斯联邦教育部副部长Ｌ·杜伯洛维娜关于苏联代表团访问中国的报告。听众对于这个详尽的报告感到很大的兴趣。杜伯洛维娜说：“我们在中国停留了三十五天，得到了不可磨灭的印象。二十二年来为国家独立进行忘我地、英勇地、坚决地斗争的英雄的中国人民，使我深受感动。我们苏联代表团在欢庆胜利和人民共和国成立的日子中和中国人民会面。”
    杜伯洛维娜叙说苏联代表团访问解放了的中国的大城市和乡村，以及同工人、农民、学生和知识分子多次会晤的情形。她强调指出，中国工人阶级的生活已得改善，占人口的绝大多数的农民已开始获得土地——这就是年轻的中华人民共和国的初步成就。
    杜伯洛维娜指出，中国共产党和她的领袖毛泽东在人民中享有极大的威信。中国人民已经在他的领导下取得了划时代的巨大胜利。
    杜伯洛维娜在她的报告的第二部分中，详述了中国人民多次表现出对于强大的苏联人民，对于中国人民的伟大友人和全体进步人类的领袖斯大林的真挚热爱和友谊。杜伯洛维娜说：我们参加了许多集会，到会的人有好几万人，有时甚至有几十万人。到处我们听到这样的话：中苏人民友谊是不可战胜的和永远巩固的。杜伯洛维娜结语说：对于中国人民对多民族的苏联所怀有的这种伟大的感情，我们可以用伟大的苏联诗人马耶可夫斯基的话来回答：伸出你的手，让我们永远友爱，亿万人的劳动中国！
    杜伯洛维娜报告后，又答复了许多有关年轻的中华人民共和国的教育制度、艺术、文学、科学和工业发展的问题。
