He explained Marshal Stalin's instructions for the Chinese revolution and the help that Marshal Stalin's cause provided to the Chinese revolution, which had a significant relationship to the victory of the Chinese revolution. Finally, he called on everyone to celebrate Marshal Stalin's birthday by learning from Stalin, learning from the Soviet Union, thoroughly eliminating all feudal forces and reactionary remnants, rapidly restoring and developing production, building the people's regime, and developing the people's culture. Build Beijing into a modern capital with a good political system and a highly developed economy and culture." (The full text of the speech will be published separately.)

Vice President Wu Han talked about his impressions after visiting the Soviet Union and called on everyone to learn from the Soviet people's valuable experience in nation-building over the past thirty-two years to build a new China. Youth representative Ma Hongfang said: "We celebrate the 70th birthday of the great teacher of mankind, Marshal Stalin. We wish him eternal health. We young people must learn from the Soviet youth's experience in nation-building and their spirit of internationalism. Under the leadership of the peace fortress of the Soviet Union, we must strive for the complete liberation of mankind."
