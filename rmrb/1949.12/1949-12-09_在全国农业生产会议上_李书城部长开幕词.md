  　Opening Speech by Minister Li Shucheng

    [Beijing News] At the National Agricultural Production Conference, which opened on December 8th, the opening speech by Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government:
    Comrades, experts, professors:
    I am very excited and pleased that we can hold a national agricultural production conference today. The National People's Liberation War has achieved a basic victory. The victory brings us excitement, light, and happiness, and at the same time poses new, complex, difficult, and great tasks for us. China is currently still a country with an agricultural economy as its mainstay. The agricultural economy accounts for 80% to 90% of the entire economy. Restoring and developing the agricultural economy is extremely important at present.
    The environment for agricultural production in 1950 is brand new and unprecedented. First of all, the victory of the revolution and the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship make it possible for us to vigorously lead the people in production in all areas without war. At present, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of 150 million and nearly 600 million mu of land, establishing a new system of land to the tillers. In these areas, the feudal oppression and exploitation system that has existed for thousands of years has been completely eliminated. Farmers have begun to freely engage in production on their own land and will definitely concentrate all their efforts on the movement to develop production and get rich. Although land reform in the new areas has not yet been implemented, the extensive people's democratic movement, the thorough suppression of bandits, and the struggle against traitors and local bullies will liberate the broad masses of people from the feudal and reactionary rule. They will establish their own regime. The policy of rent reduction and payment of rent and reasonable burden has been implemented step by step in these new areas, and in some areas, it may be basically implemented this winter, creating very favorable conditions for the development of the production movement in the new areas next year. In addition, this winter's winter school movement in various regions will further enhance the political awareness and production enthusiasm of farmers. The winter training of cadres and the work of rectification and establishment of political power in some areas will further strengthen the organization and leadership of mass production. The widespread development of the winter sideline production movement and the production relief movement in disaster areas are also directly preparing for next year's production movement.
    Second, the liberation of hundreds of large and medium-sized cities across the country not only provides modern industrial and transportation conditions to greatly assist agricultural production, but also provides broader sales channels for many agricultural and sideline products. The city's need for food and industrial raw materials greatly increases the task of agricultural production next year, and promotes and stimulates the restoration and development of agricultural production. At the same time, the strengthening of our state-owned trade organizations and the establishment of supply and marketing cooperatives enable our export goods to be exported, and in return obtain the tools and materials necessary for the development of our agricultural and industrial production.
    Third, for many years, we have used organized methods to lead millions of farmers in production, accumulating a lot of valuable knowledge and experience, and discovering and cultivating various types of labor heroes and production experts. Especially in the vast areas that have undergone land reform, where the war has ended and the stage of production and construction has begun, the widespread high enthusiasm of farmers for production and the participation of a large number of working women in production and the improvement of their production skills are the basic driving forces for the great production movement in the new China in the future. In addition, after the liberation of major cities across the country, many agricultural experts, professors, and intellectuals who have studied agricultural science, experienced agricultural technicians, as well as national agricultural colleges, agricultural experiment and research institutions, farms, etc., will serve agricultural production. Under the policy line of realizing the combination of science and technology and the broad masses, they will contribute their valuable data and opinions, and make many research experiments and promotion and improvement work. This is a new and favorable condition for restoring and improving China's agricultural production.
    Fourth, since the People's Liberation War has achieved a basic victory on a national scale, the People's Liberation Army, except for a part that must continue to pursue and eliminate the remnants of the enemy, will have a large number of troops who will combine reorganization and training to devote themselves to agricultural production and construction. The Military Commission of the Central People's Government has now issued instructions on the work of the army participating in production and construction in 1950. This powerful new force, which has undergone thousands of battles, tempering, and has a tradition of labor and production experience, will also play a huge role on the production and construction front.
    But at the same time, there are still many realistic or potentially occurring difficulties that must be correctly estimated:
    First, our rural areas have undergone more than ten years of war and suffered long-term devastation and destruction by the reactionary rulers of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which has caused various disasters, causing the general production volume to drop by about a quarter compared with before the war. How to restore this decline is what we need to do first. This year, 60 million to 100 million mu of land across the country suffered severe floods, droughts, and other disasters, which will cause great difficulties in certain areas next year, and may even lead to severe spring famine. Second, in the newly liberated areas, land reform has not yet been carried out, and most of the land and means of production are in the hands of feudal landlords and old rich peasants. These landlords and old rich peasants also clearly know that land reform will inevitably be implemented, and their production enthusiasm is turbulent and passive. Farmers will have a waiting mentality due to lack of means of production and tools, and insufficient understanding of policies. Third, the war has not yet ended in some places, and we must vigorously support the front. Many new areas still need to continue to eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, and cannot concentrate all their efforts to lead production. Therefore, production in these areas is not easy to improve, and if the work is not done well, it may also decrease.
    Based on the above-mentioned various situations, and in accordance with the spirit of Article 34 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which stipulates that "the People's Government should, in accordance with the national plan and the needs of the people's lives, strive to restore and exceed the pre-war production level of grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods in a short period of time," our guiding principle for the agricultural production movement in 1950 should be to focus on restoration. In general, the old areas should increase by 10% compared with 1949, and the areas with better conditions should strive to restore the pre-war production level. The new areas should be required to maintain the 1949 production level, and the areas with better conditions to overcome water and drought disasters should strive to increase slightly. All localities should use the methods of organization and technology improvement to increase grain production and increase the production of industrial raw materials in order to restore industry, improve agricultural productivity, ensure military and civilian food supply, and lay the foundation for restoring the pre-war level within three to five years as instructed by Chairman Mao.
    According to the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council and the needs of all parties, in 1950, we require an increase of 10 billion jin of food, and an increase of 4.7 million dan of cotton. I believe this is definitely possible. It is estimated that the country has a cultivated area of approximately 1.4 billion mu. The total grain output before the war was 276.5 billion jin. During the Anti-Japanese War, the average was approximately 228.3 billion jin, a decrease of 17.44% compared to before the war. Due to the destruction of the enemy in the past and the severity of the water and drought disasters in 1949, it is estimated that only 212.5 billion jin were harvested, a decrease of one-quarter compared to before the war. The national cotton planting area is approximately 39 million mu, a decrease of 37% compared to before the war. Based on the above situation, we hope to first improve the cultivation level in the old areas in 1950, develop animal husbandry, increase fertilizer, develop water conservancy, prevent and control floods, prevent and eliminate diseases and insect pests, reclaim wasteland, and promote improved varieties, etc. Calculated at an increase of 10%, it may increase by 10 billion jin (newly liberated areas are not included in the calculation). Cotton requires an increase in planting to 50 million mu (excluding abandoned areas), and the average yield per mu should be increased by 20% compared to 1949, for a total production of 13 million dan. This is our extremely arduous and necessary great task to be accomplished.
    Our conference is attended by comrades who lead agricultural production from local governments, and many well-known experts and professors have been invited. In particular, local governments in Northeast, East China, Central China, and North China provinces have held agricultural production conferences before our conference. Therefore, the tasks of our conference are: First, we should mainly base ourselves on the planning opinions of local governments, clarify the national situation, and formulate a more specific and appropriate plan for national agricultural production in 1950. Second, in order to make a good plan, there must be various specific measures for implementation, such as the organization of labor, overcoming the difficulties of animal power, the development of water conservancy, the improvement of varieties, the increase of fertilizer application, the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and the reclamation of wasteland. There must be specific methods to prevent the plan from failing. Third, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council instructed that our conference should mainly focus on solving the increase in food and cotton production, and the construction of water conservancy; the conference should be good at grasping this spirit, and all issues must revolve around this center; other issues, although they cannot be fully discussed due to the time constraints of the conference, we will also study them step by step in a responsible spirit after the meeting to seek their solution; Fourth, the conference should implement the spirit of unity and learning, understand each other's situations, learn new experiences and practices, and combine theory with practice; only in this way can the role of experts be better played, and the opinions of experts will be more valuable. Administrative cadres should not only know how to grasp policies, but also pay attention to learning scientific knowledge and learning technology; only in this way will it be more conducive to leadership work, and through humble learning, achieve mutual understanding and mutual unity; Fifth, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has not been established for long, the organization is not yet sound, and the understanding of the situation and the collection of information are not sufficient. Therefore, it increases the responsibility of the comrades attending the meeting, requiring everyone to concentrate their efforts to make the meeting a success.

### 在全国农业生产会议上　李书城部长开幕词

　　在全国农业生产会议上
  　李书城部长开幕词
    【北京讯】在十二月八日开幕的全国农业生产会议上，中央人民政府农业部李书城部长的开幕词：各位同志，各位专家，教授：
    今天能召开全国性的农业生产会议，我感到十分兴奋愉快。全国人民解放战争已取得了基本上的胜利，胜利给我们带来兴奋，带来光明和幸福，同时也给我们提出了新的复杂艰难而伟大的任务。中国目前还是一个以农业经济为主体的国家，农业经济占整个经济比重的百分之八、九十，恢复和发展农业经济，在当前是极其重要的。
    一九五○年农业生产所处的环境是崭新的空前未有的。首先是革命的胜利，人民民主专政的确立，使我们有可能在一切没有战争的地区，以大力领导人民进行生产。目前已经有一万万五千万人口与近六万万亩土地的地区完成了土地改革，确立了新的耕者有其田的制度，在这些地区里，几千年来的封建压迫与剥削制度，已经彻底消灭了，农民开始在自己的土地上自由地进行生产，一定会全力集中到生产发家的运动上去。新区土地改革，虽然还未实行，但广泛的人民民主运动，彻底肃清土匪、进行反奸反霸斗争，将使广大人民，从封建反动的统治下，开始解放出来；建立自己的政权；减租交租与合理负担的政策，已经在这些新区有步骤地推行，某些地区今年冬季还可能做到基本上的贯彻执行，对于明年新区生产运动的开展，造成了十分有利的条件。此外今年冬天各地区的冬学运动，会更加提高农民的政治觉悟及生产情绪，某些地区干部的冬季集训，整组建政工作，将进一步加强对于群众生产的组织与领导；普遍的开展了冬季副业生产运动，与灾区在进行中的生产救灾运动，也为明年的生产运动做了直接的准备。
    第二、全国几百个大中城市的解放，不但有了近代化的工业与交通条件，给农业生产以极大的援助，而且许多农产品副业生产品也因之得到了更广大的销路。城市食粮与工业原料的需要，大大加重了明年农业生产的任务，并推动与刺激着农业生产的恢复与发展。同时我们国营贸易组织的加强，供销合作社的建立，就使我们的外销物资可以出口，换回我们发展农工业生产所必需的工具与资料。
    第三、多年来我们用组织起来的方法领导千百万农民进行生产，积累了很多宝贵的知识与经验，并发现与培育了各种各式的劳动英雄与生产能手。特别是在战争业已结束，开始进入生产建设阶段的广大经过土地改革的地区，农民生产情绪的普遍高涨，与广大劳动妇女参加生产及其生产本领的提高，这是新中国今后大生产运动的基本动力。加以全国各大城市解放后，许多农业专家们，教授们，及学习过农业科学的知识分子们，有经验的农业技术人员们以及全国农科学校、农事试验研究机关、农场等，均将要为农业生产服务，在实现科学技术与广大群众结合的政策路线下，会贡献出他们的宝贵资料及意见，作出许多研究试验及推广改良的工作。这是恢复与提高中国农业生产的新的有利条件。
    第四、由于人民解放战争已经取得了全国范围内的基本上的胜利，人民解放军除有一部必须继续追歼残敌外，将会有大量军队结合着整训而投入农业生产建设。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会现已发出一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示，这一支强大的经过千万次战斗、锻炼、有劳动传统与生产经验的生力军，在生产建设战线上亦会发挥极大的作用。
    但同时也还有许多现实的或可能发生的困难，必须予以正确的估计：
    第一、我们的农村，曾经过十几年战争，并遭受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治者长时期的摧残与破坏，因而引起了各种灾害，使生产量一般较战前下降了四分之一左右。如何恢复这个下降数字，是我们首先需要做的。今年全国有六千万亩至一万万土地受到严重的水旱等灾，使明年一定地区感到极大困难，甚至会发生严重的春荒。第二、新解放地区，土地改革尚未进行，土地与生产资料大部掌握在封建地主与旧富农手里，而这些地主与旧富农也明明知道土地改革必然要实行，生产情绪动荡与消极怠工。农民因为缺乏生产资料和工具，与对政策认识不足，会发生等待心理。第三、有些地方战争还没有结束，仍须大力支援前线。许多新区还须要继续肃清蒋匪残余，不能集中全力来领导生产，因此在这些地方的生产，不容易提高，如果工作做不好，还可能降低。
    根据上述各种情况，根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三十四条中规定“人民政府应根据国家计划和人民生活的需要，争取于短时期内恢复并超过战前粮食，工业原料和外销物资的生产水平”的精神，我们一九五○年农业生产运动的方针，应该以恢复为主，老区一般较一九四九年提高一成，条件较好的地区，争取恢复战前生产水平，新区则要求保持一九四九年的生产水平，战胜水旱灾害条件较好的地区，争取略加提高。各地要用组织起来和提高技术的办法，增产粮食，增产工业原料，以恢复工业，提高农业生产力，保证军需民食，打下毛主席指示我们的三五年内在全国范围内恢复战前水平的基础。
    根据政务院财委会的指示和各方面的需要，在一九五○年，我们要求增产食粮一○○亿斤，增产棉花四七○万市担，我相信这是一定可能的。全国估计有耕地面积约一四亿亩，食粮总产量，战前为二七六五亿斤，抗战期间平均约为二二八三亿斤，较战前已减低百分之一七．四四，因过去敌人的摧残破坏，及一九四九年水旱灾害的严重，估计仅收二一二五亿斤，比战前降低四分之一。全国植棉面积约为三九○○万亩，较战前缩小百分之三七，基于上述情况，我们在一九五○年希望先在老区提高耕作水平，发展畜养，增加肥料，发展水利，防治水患，防除病虫害，开垦荒地，推广优良品种等，按增产一成计算，可能增产一○○亿斤（新解放区暂不计算在内）。棉花要求增植至五○○○万亩（废弃面积除外），每亩平均产量较一九四九年要提高二成，共生产一、三○○万市担。这就是我们极其艰巨而必需达成的伟大的任务。
    我们这次大会有各地方政府领导农业生产的同志们参加，并邀请了许多知名的专家教授，尤其是东北、华东、华中以及华北各省的地方政府，都在我们的大会前召开过农业生产会议，因之我们大会的任务：第一、应该主要依据各地方政府的计划意见，弄清全国情况，拟定一九五○年全国农业生产比较具体恰当的计划。第二、作好计划还要有贯彻执行的各种具体措施，诸如劳动力的组织，畜力困难的克服，水利的发展，品种的改良，肥料的增施，病虫害的防治，荒地的开垦等，都需要有具体办法，才不致使计划落空。第三、政务院财经委员会指示我们大会主要应以解决食粮棉花增产，与兴修水利为中心；大会应善于掌握这一精神，一切问题都须围绕着这一中心；其他问题，虽因大会时间关系不能充分讨论，我们亦将以负责的精神，会后逐步研究，求其解决；第四、大会要贯彻团结与学习精神，互相了解情况，学习新的经验与作法，把理论与实际结合起来；只有这样做才能更好地发挥专家的作用，专家的意见才更宝贵，行政干部不仅要懂得掌握政策，还要注意学习科学知识，学习技术，只有这样做才更有助于领导工作，经过虚心的学习，作到互相了解，互相团结；第五、中央农业部组成不久，组织即未健全，情况了解与资料搜集也不够充分。因此就加重了与会同志的责任，要求大家集中精力，把会开好。
