　　Income Tax on Profitable Enterprises and Business Tax
　　Successfully Completed in Beijing
    Reason: After full discussion and decision by representatives from all walks of life, and in-depth mobilization and promotion by government and business representatives, policies were implemented to ensure fairness and reasonableness.
    [Beijing News] The work of combining and levying the first half of 1949 income tax on profitable enterprises and the summer business tax in Beijing, in installments, has now been basically completed. In addition to the 3.6644 billion yuan pre-collected and deposited in the treasury in late November, the amount deposited in the treasury during the two payment periods from December 6th to 15th and December 16th to 25th totaled 11.68598 billion yuan, accounting for 97.08% of the total amount collected. Those who failed to pay on time due to actual difficulties or late issuance of payment notices by the tax bureau, as well as individual cases of intentional delay, accounted for only 2.92% of the total; the Beijing Tax Bureau has obtained the consent of the promotion committee members and is handling them according to their respective circumstances.
    After the unified collection of the two taxes began, industrial and commercial households were very active in making payments. For example, in the first period from December 6th to 15th, the amount deposited in the treasury reached over 91%, enabling the collection work to be completed smoothly. The first reason is that the unified collection of the two taxes was fully discussed and decided by the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, which was unanimously supported by representatives of all strata of the people. In-depth communication and mobilization was carried out through newspapers and representatives of all sectors, especially the industrial and commercial sectors, so that industrial and commercial households generally understood the significance of government taxation and their glorious obligation to pay taxes. Secondly, the preparation, deliberation and mobilization work for this collection was relatively good. On November 7th, a municipal promotion committee was established, including six government representatives and twenty-five representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors; at the same time, industry review committees and review groups were set up, as well as twenty joint review groups composed of similar industries. During the entire preparation and implementation period of the collection, the Municipal Promotion Committee held a total of nine meetings, striving to make the burden on industrial and commercial households fair and reasonable. The Municipal Government also established a unified collection review committee on December 6th, personally led by Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu, to pay attention to the implementation of tax policies at all times. Thirdly, in the collection work, the Beijing Tax Bureau adhered to the spirit of "wearing out shoes and breaking our tongues." Tax sub-bureaus generally adopted the method of holding conferences of industrial and commercial households, and some cadres even went to the taxpayers' homes to collect taxes on their behalf. In addition, the Municipal Tax Bureau specially made 20 award flags and more than 100 certificates of merit to award to model households, groups, and industries that took the lead in paying taxes. The Municipal Government has reviewed this tax collection work, and the main shortcomings in the work are that the decision on installment collection, the proclamation regulations, and oral explanations were not clear enough; the price of rice was not clearly stipulated in the later period. Secondly, the prior typical investigation was not enough, and it was not well combined with democratic appraisal, so the tax bureau's work was sometimes passive. In addition, in the minds of the working cadres, due to eagerness to complete the task, there were still some careless work styles.

　　营利事业所得税与营业税
　  京市胜利完成征收
    原因是：经过各界代表会充分讨论决定，以及政府、工商界代表深入动员推动，贯彻政策，做到公平合理。
    【北京讯】京市一九四九年上半年营利事业所得税与夏季营业税全并、分期征收工作，现已基本上完成。除十一月下旬预征纳库三十六亿六千四百余万元外，十二月六日至十五日，十六日至二十五日两期缴款期限内，纳库数字计达一百一十六亿八千五百九十八万余元，占征收总额的百分之九七点○八。因有实际困难或税局缴款通知书发的晚等原因而未能按期缴纳的，以及个别故意拖延不交的，只占总数百分之二点九二；京市税务局已征得各推进委员同意，正分别情况处理中。
    此次两税统一征收工作开始后，工商业户缴款的都很踊跃，如在十二月六日到十五日第一期内，纳库数字便达百分之九十一强，使征收工作得以顺利完成。其原因首先是此次两税统征，是经由北京市第二届各界人民代表会议予以充分讨论并决定了的，是各阶层人民代表都一致拥护的，并通过报纸以及各界特别是工商业界自己的代表进行了深入的传达与动员，使工商业户普遍了解政府征税的意义和自己纳税的光荣义务。其次，此次征收工作的准备与酝酿动员工作是比较好的。十一月七日便成立了包括政府六人与工商业界代表二十五人的市推进委员会；同时，并设立了行业评议委员会与评议小组，以及由相近行业组成的二十个联评小组。在整个征收准备及进行期间，市推委会共举行了九次会议，尽量使各工商业户负担公平合理。市政府也在十二月六日成立了统一征收覆核委员会，由张友渔副市长亲自领导，随时注意税收政策的贯彻执行。再次，京市税务局在征收工作中，坚持了“跑断腿，说破嘴”的精神，各税务分局普遍采取了召开工商业户大会的方式，有的干部还亲自到纳税户去代收税款。此外，市税局曾特制了二十面奖旗和一百多张奖状，奖给带头缴款的模范户、小组及行业。对此次征税工作，市府已进行检讨，工作中的缺点主要是对分期征收的决定，布告规定及口头解释得不够明确；后期米价没有明确规定。其次，事先典型调查的还不够，未与民主评议很好结合，税局工作因而有时陷于被动。此外，在工作干部思想中，由于完成任务心切，也还存有某些粗枝大叶的作风。
