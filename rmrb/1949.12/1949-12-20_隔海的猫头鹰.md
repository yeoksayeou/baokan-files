　　The Owl Across the Sea
    Xue ＠
    The owl across the sea is hooting...
    It hoots about "importance" and "writing off."
    This sound travels from the other side of the ocean to mainland China. When the Chinese people hear it, they immediately associate it with another habitually disgusting concept. They will say: Look, what a contradictory and hateful beast!
    Yes, the reason why it is now called a "contradictory and hateful beast" instead of a "bad omen" is very simple: in China, the era of superstition and fear of owls has passed. Although on the other side of the ocean, or in the cypress tree graves common in China, the owl is always regarded as a symbol of "bad luck," the embodiment of evil. However, the Chinese people now openly express their hatred for them. The Chinese people are now the revolutionary sun of the East, the masters of light. Everything on earth is cheering for her and thriving for her. Only owls, these dark creatures, close their eyes because of her brilliant light. In the light of day, look at its dignified appearance! It looks neither like a bird nor a beast. It dwells on the other side of the vast ocean, lamenting that Taiwan is a very "important" "strategic base," and the US government is still considering this issue... But then it says that it and other government officials have already "written off" this island. Bah! What a contradictory suite, what a hopeless deception! The sun of history has exposed the twisted and ugly faces of the owls. Take a careful look inside and out and see what a contradictory and hateful beast it is!
    Obviously, conspiracy and deception are woven together by baseness, but baseness is destined to fail. Your loyal servant, the "Chiang Kai-shek Dynasty," has been beaten to pieces by the brave Chinese people and finally driven out of the mainland; Li Zongren has also taken a plane to your "esteemed country," and soon you will have more exiled "distinguished guests"; Chiang Tingfu, the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren bandits at the United Nations General Assembly, was also finally denied by the wise Vyshinsky and representatives of other New Democratic countries... In the process, the Chinese people have repelled so much baseness and exposed so much deception! Now you are weaving baseness with "importance" and "writing off" to carry out conspiracies. Mr. Acheson the Owl, Kukryniksy's cartoon "Dirty Tricks of the American Hand" published in Pravda not long ago is excellent. I think my article is also unkind to the owl gentlemen and their servants, because after the conspiracy is exposed, what remains is only baseness and helpless emptiness. That is the true value of the conspiracy.
    If you are not satisfied with this, I would also like to say: The Chinese people attach great "importance" to Li Zongren's flight to the United States, as well as the owls who will continue to be your exiled "distinguished guests" from the sky, the ground, and the sea. And we must resolutely "write them off" from the household registration of the Chinese people. In addition, their fate is inextricably linked to yours. Aren't the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and Li Zongren bandits... already running a relay race on the same track as you? Look, Li Zongren the bandit has already run to your relay line, and Chiang Kai-shek the bandit, etc., are about to run there. But the runway always has an end!
    Therefore, the Chinese people must do what they should do. The ocean is the Chinese people's ocean, Taiwan is the Chinese people's Taiwan, and the borderland is the Chinese people's sacred borderland. The Chinese people's "powerful pulse of new life" (Fadeyev's words) is the Chinese people's revolutionary "breath of history itself" (ibid.). Nearly 500 million people must create their beautiful future. This may be something you attach more "importance" to, but it is absolutely impossible to "write off." Owls across the sea! These are the two meanings of the two words arranged by history. Therefore, I believe that your anxiety and contradictions, conspiracies and baseness are inevitable and real, but the development of history will shatter your conspiracies one by one. Acheson's recent "importance" and "writing off" of Taiwan is one of these events.
    Give the owl across the sea a resounding slap in the face. Taiwan is the Chinese people's Taiwan, and the Chinese people's territory is sacred!

　　隔海的猫头鹰
    薛＠
    隔海的猫头鹰叫了……
    它叫着：“重视”和“一笔勾销”。
    这声音从海洋的彼岸传达到中国大陆上来，中国人民听到了，便会立即和另一个习惯的使人厌恶的概念结合起来。他们会说：你看，这是怎样的一个矛盾得可憎的禽兽呵！
    是的，现在所以说它是一个“矛盾得可憎的禽兽”，而不再说它是一个“不吉利的犹物”，原因很简单，那就是：在中国，迷信与恐惧猫头鹰的时代已经过去了，虽然在海洋的彼岸，或者在中国常见的柏树坟里的猫头鹰无论何时它都是被看作“不吉利”的象征，罪恶的化身的。但是，现在的中国人民却要公开表示对它们的憎恶了。中国人民现在是东方的革命的太阳，光明的主人。大地上的万物都在为她欢呼，为她繁茂。只有猫头鹰这一类黑暗的动物，才因为她的灿烂的光芒而关闭了它们的眼睛。在光天化日的照耀下，你瞧瞧它的那幅尊相呵！既不象飞禽，也不象走兽，栖息在漫漫大海的彼岸，嘴里哀叫着台湾是一个很“重要”的“战略基地”，美国政府仍在考虑这一问题中……但是，又说它与其他的政府官员业已把这个岛屿“一笔勾销”了。呸！好一个矛盾的组曲，好一桩没有出路的欺骗呵！历史的太阳，已把猫头鹰们的扭曲了的丑相暴晒了，你里里外外的认真鉴赏一下吧，看它是一个怎样的矛盾得可憎的禽兽呵！
    很显然的，阴谋与欺骗都是卑鄙编织起来的，但是卑鄙都是注定的一一失败了。你们的忠实奴仆“蒋家小王朝”，已经被勇敢的中国人民打得七零八落，从大陆上被最后驱逐了；李宗仁又坐上飞机逃向你们“贵国”去，按着你们不久又要多一些流亡“贵宾”了；联合国大会上蒋、李匪帮的代表蒋廷黻也被英明的维辛斯基和其他新民主主义国家的代表予以最后否认了……在这过程中间，中国人民打退了多少卑劣，揭露了多少的欺骗呵！现在你们又用“重视”与“一笔勾销”编织着卑劣来进行阴谋了。猫头鹰艾奇逊先生，在不久以前，真理报上库克里尼克赛发表的那幅“美国手的肮脏把戏”的漫画，是很好的，我想我的这篇文章对于猫头鹰绅士们和它的奴仆们也是不善的，因为阴谋被揭穿了以后，剩下来的就只能是卑劣和无可奈何的空虚了，那阴谋的真实价值就在这里。
    如果关于这点你还不满足的话，我还想说：中国人民对于李宗仁飞美，以及将要从天上、地下、海里继续去作你们的流亡“贵宾”的猫头鹰们，是非常“重视”的，而且我们一定要坚决的将它们从中国国民的户籍册上“一笔勾销”。另外，它们的命运与你们的命运是一脉相连的，蒋匪介石、李匪宗仁……不是已经同你们在一个跑道上作着接力赛吗？你看，李匪宗仁已经跑向你们的那条接力线上去了，蒋匪介石等等就要跑去。但是，跑道是总有个尽头的！
    所以中国人民一定要做完自己应作的事情，海洋是中国人民的海洋，台湾是中国人民的台湾，边疆是中国人民的神圣的边疆，中国人民的“新生活的有力脉搏”（法捷耶夫语）是中国人民革命“历史自身的呼吸”（同上），近五万万的人民一定要创作其美好的未来。这一点也许是你们更加“重视”的，但却是绝对无法“一笔勾销”的。隔岸的猫头鹰们！这就是历史给安排下的两个字眼的两个意义。所以我认为你们的焦急和矛盾，阴谋和卑劣是必然的，是真实的，但是历史的发展是会把你们的阴谋一一粉碎的，艾奇逊最近对台湾的“重视”和“一笔勾销”就是这些事件中的一个。
    给隔海的猫头鹰一个响亮的耳光吧，台湾是中国人民台湾，中国人民的国土是神圣的！
