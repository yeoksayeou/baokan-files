Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st -- TASS, Moscow, November 30th: The Pravda published an editorial entitled "Striving for Peace, Democracy, and National Independence of All Peoples," which reads as follows:

　　The resolution of the Cominform, announced on November 29th, is of paramount importance to the activities of Communist and Workers' Parties in all countries and to safeguarding the vital interests of the broad masses of people around the world.

　　The Cominform meeting is being held at a time when the forces of imperialist reaction, led by the American monopoly groups, are developing new war preparations, carrying out campaigns against democracy, against the vital interests of the working people, and against the national independence of many countries. Based on the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the Cominform meeting made a profound exposition of the international situation, pointing out that the further change in the balance of power on the international stage is even more favorable to the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Cominform resolution emphasizes that, on the one hand, the aggressiveness of the imperialist camp is growing daily; on the other hand, the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, led by the powerful socialist Soviet state, have grown stronger in the struggle against the imperialist and war camp.

　　The consolidation and expansion of the democratic, anti-imperialist camp can be clearly illustrated by various prominent developments in the current period. For example: the vast progress of the Soviet people's economy, culture, and living standards, the political and economic strengthening of the People's Democratic countries and their embarking on the road of building socialism, the historic victory of the Chinese revolution, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the development of the vast movement for peace, and the strengthening of the Communist Parties.

　　The first Cominform meeting, held in 1947, pointed out that the forces of imperialism were weakened as a result of the Second World War, and since then, this process has intensified. The victories of the democratic and socialist camp, the economic crisis maturing in capitalist countries, the sharpening of all the contradictions of the capitalist system, and the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism all prove this. The more acute the contradictions of capitalism become and the stronger the democratic and socialist camp, the more furious become the American and British imperialist bosses who seek to launch a new world war to seize world hegemony and strengthen the position of monopoly capital. The entire policy of the Anglo-American bloc serves the preparation of a new war. Just as the fascist aggressors did, the Anglo-American imperialists are preparing for war in all aspects of military strategic measures, political pressure and intimidation, economic expansion and enslavement of various nations, ideological deception of the masses, and strengthening of reactionary activities.

　　The struggle to defend peace and oppose warmongers is the most pressing issue for the people of the world. This issue stirs the hearts of workers, peasants, intellectuals, various middle strata, and the broad masses. The Cominform pointed out the root and hotbed of the danger of war, and indicated the path of the struggle against the danger of a new war and the path to safeguarding peace and the security of all nations. All peace-loving people, all those who do not want to be thrown into the abyss of a devastating massacre, all those who do not want to be ruined along with their families for the selfish interests of a handful of American and British tycoons, must unite on a broad world scale and fight to defend lasting peace.

　　The unprecedentedly magnificent and powerful movement of peace supporters is a clear proof of the masses' will to fight for peace and their determination to fight back against the warmongers. The representatives of the Communist Parties of all countries believe that the current task is to make the peace supporters' movement a global, militant, and effective movement, and a movement that ensures the establishment of a strong obstacle on the road to launching war. The common destiny of the working class and the unity of the working class ranks play a paramount role in the struggle to defend peace, uphold democracy, safeguard the vital interests of the working people and the national independence of all nations, and oppose the aggression of the United States and other imperialists.

　　Accompanying the preparations for a new war is the reactionary forces' frantic attack on democratic freedoms and the reactionary forces' attack on the living standards of the working class and working people in capitalist countries. In order to achieve their goals, the reactionary groups first try to split the workers' movement and split its ranks. The bourgeoisie entrusted this evil and despicable mission of division to right-wing social democrats - Bevin and Attlee, Blum and Mollet, Schumacher and Renner, Spaak and Saragat, and to reactionary trade union leaders such as Deakin, Green, and Carey. These guys engage in despicable and dirty tricks every day, bringing infighting and quarrels to the workers' movement. This is why the struggle to win the unity of the working class requires tireless exposure of right-wing socialists and isolating them from the masses. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out persistent and patient work among ordinary workers who stand with the Social Democratic Party and with the Catholic trade unions, to explain to these workers the treacherous role of the reactionary leaders, and to involve all workers in the active struggle for peace and for their vital interests.

　　Unifying actions from below is the most reliable way to unite and combine all workers, regardless of party affiliation, trade union membership, or religious belief. The issue of the unity of the working class has never played such a decisive role as it does today. Therefore, the Communist Party will work tirelessly to solve this task.

　　The Cominform has passed a resolution on the "Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the Hands of Murderers and Spies." The Cominform meeting unanimously determined that the Tito-Ranković clique has turned from bourgeois nationalism to fascism and directly sold out the national interests of Yugoslavia to Anglo-American imperialists. After the Cominform meeting in 1948 exposed the betrayal of the Tito clique, exposed its betrayal of proletarian internationalism and its adoption of a bourgeois nationalist stance, this clique has further plunged into the abyss of betrayal and counter-revolution. The Central Committee and the government of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have completely joined the imperialist bloc, opposing the entire socialist and democratic camp, opposing the Communist Parties of the world, and opposing the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union. The Cominform meeting pointed out in its resolution that the "Communist Party of Yugoslavia," composed of the current gang of people, has fallen into the hands of the enemies of the people - murderers and spies, and has lost the right to call itself a Communist Party; it is nothing more than a tool for carrying out the espionage tasks assigned by the Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, and Đilas clique. The resolution of the Cominform will help all true patriots and fighters in Yugoslavia to liberate the suffering people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. The Cominform believes that: "The struggle against the Tito clique - hired spies and assassins - is the international task of all Communist and Workers' Parties."

　　The Cominform's resolution points out that the organizational, ideological, and political consolidation of Communist and Workers' Parties in all countries on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles is a major and necessary condition for a victorious struggle for peace, for the national independence of their countries, for democracy, and for socialism. An irreconcilable struggle against all kinds of manifestations of opportunism, sectarianism, and bourgeois nationalism, and a struggle against the infiltration of enemy agents into the Party - this task has particular urgency in the current situation. The developments of the past two years have proved how tremendously important the resolution of the representatives of several Communist Parties held in 1947 to establish the Cominform for the exchange of experience and the coordination of the actions of the Communist Parties of all countries on the basis of mutual agreement is in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　The first Cominform meeting clarified the balance of power on the international stage after the Second World War, confirming the existence of two camps - the imperialist camp and the anti-imperialist camp. The meeting urged the people of all countries, especially the people of European nations, to pay attention to the emergence of the danger of war and the danger of being enslaved by Anglo-American imperialism. The meeting raised the banner of fighting for the independence of Europe and other countries and against the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism, and called on the Communist Parties of all countries to lead the struggle for their national independence. The second Cominform meeting, held in 1948, exposed the malignant sore of bourgeois nationalism within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and timely exposed the Tito clique, which betrayed democracy and socialism. The Cominform's resolution on the Yugoslav issue and the relentless struggle against the degenerates of bourgeois nationalism have strengthened the principles of proletarian internationalism in the world communist movement, and further consolidated the ranks of the world communist movement on the basis of the immortal doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

　　The resolution of the Cominform meeting held in Hungary in the second half of November 1949 aims to unite the broadest masses to fight against the danger of a new war. These resolutions arm the Communists, the working class, and the working people to fight for peace, democracy, the national independence of all nations, and the vital interests of the working people. These resolutions expose the incurable diseases of the imperialist system and the further weakening of imperialism. The Cominform's resolutions strengthen the working class's confidence in the inevitable victory of their cause, and demonstrate the growing strength of the democratic camp, which is inspired by the great Stalin to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　争取和平、民主和各国人民的民族独立
    真理报社论
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一月三十日讯，真理报发表社论，题为“争取和平、民主和各国人民的民族独立”，文如下：
    十一月二十九日所公布的共产党情报局的决议，对各国共产党和工人党的活动，对保卫世界各国广大群众的切身利益，是具有头等重要性的。
    情报局会议的举行，正当美国垄断集团所领导的帝国主义反动派力量正在发展新战争准备、正在进行运动来反对民主、反对劳动人民切身利益、反对许多国家的民族独立的时候。情报局会议根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，对国际局势作出了深刻的叙述，指出了国际舞台上力量对比的进一步改变，正更有利于和平、民主和社会主义阵营。情报局决议着重指出：一方面，帝国主义阵营的侵略性日形增长；另一方面，以强大的社会主义苏维埃国家为首的和平、民主和社会主义的力量，已在对帝国主义和战争阵营所进行的斗争中，发展壮大起来了。
    民主、反帝国主义阵营的巩固和扩大，可由目前时期各种突出的发展情况得到极为明＠的说明。例如：苏联人民的经济、文化和生活水准的广大进展，人民民主国家在政治和经济上的加强及这些国家走上建设社会主义的大道，中国革命的历史性胜利，德意志民主共和国的成立，争取和平的广大运动的发展，与共产党的加强。
    一九四七年举行的情报局第一次会议曾指出：由于第二次世界大战，帝国主义的力量是被削弱了，自那个时候起，这种过程的进行已更为加紧。民主和社会主义阵营的胜利，资本主义各国正在成熟的经济危机，资本主义制度的一切矛盾的尖锐化，资本主义的总危机的日益深重等，就证明了这一点。资本主义的矛盾变得愈尖锐，民主和社会主义阵营愈强大，则那些希图发动新的世界战争以攫取世界霸权并加强垄断资本地位的美英帝国主义头子们，也就愈加愤怒。美英集团的全部政策都是为准备新战争而服务的。正如法西斯侵略者所做的一样，美英帝国主义者正在军事战略措施、政治压力和吓诈、经济扩张与对各国人民的奴役、思想上欺骗群众，和加强反动活动等各方面，进行战争的准备。
    保卫和平与反对战争挑拨者的斗争，对全世界人民来说，是一个最为迫切的问题。这个问题激动着工人、农民、知识分子、各中间阶层和广大群众的心。共产党情报局指出了战争危险的根源和温床，指明了反对新战争危险的斗争的途径和保卫和平与各民族安全的途径。一切酷爱和平的人，一切不愿意被投入毁灭性的大屠杀的深渊的人，一切不愿意为了寥寥无几的美国和英国大亨们的自私利益而使他们自己和他们家属沦于毁灭的人，必须在广泛的世界规模上团结起来，为保卫持久和平而斗争。
    规模无比宏伟的和平拥护者声势浩大的运动，是群众争取和平的意志的明证，是他们反击战争贩子的决心的明证。各国共产党的代表认为当前的任务，就是使和平拥护者的运动成为世界性的、战斗的、而且有效的运动，成为确保在发动战争的道路上树立起强有力的障碍的运动。工人阶级的休戚相关和工人阶级队伍的团结，在保卫和平、维护民主、维护劳动人民的切身利益和各国人民的民族独立、反对美国及其它帝国主义者侵害的斗争中，起着头等重要的作用。
    伴随着新战争准备的，是反动派对民主之自由的疯狂进攻，是反动派对资本主义各国的工人阶级与劳苦大众生活水准的进攻。反动集团为了达到他们的目的，首先便力图分裂工人运动，力图分裂其队伍。资产阶级把这个罪恶而卑鄙的分裂使命，付托给右翼社会民主党人——贝文与艾德礼、勃鲁姆与摩勒、舒马赫与伦纳、斯巴克与萨拉盖特，付托给反动的工会首领如狄金、格林、加莱等。这些家伙天天无法无天地从事那些卑鄙肮脏的勾当，给工人运动带来倾轧与争吵。这就是争取工人阶级团结的斗争，为什么要求不倦地揭发右翼社会党人，并使他们孤立于群众之外的原因。同时，也需要在那些与社会民主党及与天主教工会站在一起的普通工人当中，进行坚持而耐心的工作，对这些工人阐明反动领袖的判逆作用，并使一切工人都卷入争取和平、争取他们切身利益的积极斗争中。
    从下面把行动统一起来，这就是把一切工人不分党派、不分所属工会及宗教信仰而团结、联合起来的最可靠的方法。工人阶级的团结问题从未起过象今天所起的决定性的作用。因此，共产党将不卷地工作以解决这一任务。
    情报局已通过关于“在杀人犯和间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党”的决议。情报局会议已一致确定：铁托、兰科维奇集团已由资产阶级的民族主义转变到法西斯主义，并直接把南斯拉夫的民族利益出卖给美英帝国主义者。在一九四八年共产党情报局会议揭露了铁托集团的背叛，揭露了它背叛无产阶级国际主义及采取资产阶级民族主义的立场以后，这一集团已更进一层地堕入叛逆和反革命的深渊了。南斯拉夫共产党中央委员会及政府完全参加了帝国主义集团，反对整个社会主义和民主阵营，反对全世界的共产党，反对人民民主国家和苏联。情报局会议在其决议中指出：由现在这班人马组成的“南斯拉夫共产党”已堕入了人民的敌人——杀人和间谍的掌握中，已丧失了自称共产党的权利，它不过是履行铁托、卡德尔、兰科维奇、德热拉斯集团所分配的间谍任务的工具而已。共产党情报局的决议，将有助于南斯拉夫一切真正的爱国者与斗士去解放苦难深重的南斯拉夫各族人民。共产党情报局认为：“反对铁托集团——受雇佣的间谍与刺客的斗争，是所有一切共产党和工人党的国际任务。”
    共产党情报局的决议指出：各国共产党与工人党在马列主义原则之上的组织上、思想上与政治上的巩固，是为和平、为他们国家的民族独立、为民主与社会主义而进行胜利斗争的重大而必要的条件。与机会主义、宗派主义及资产阶级民族主义的各种各样的表现作不调和的斗争，与敌人走卒之渗入党内作斗争——这个任务在目前的情况下具有特别的迫切性。过去两年中的发展情形证明，一九四七年举行的数国共产党代表会议关于成立情报局以交换经验及在相互同意之基础上协调各国共产党之行动的这一决议，在争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争中，是具有何等巨大的重要性。
    情报局第一次会议曾阐明了第二次世界大战以后国际舞台上的力量对比，确认了两个阵营——帝国主义阵营与反帝国主义阵营的存在。会议曾促请一切国家的人民，首先是欧洲各民族人民注意战争危险的出现，注意他们有被美英帝国主义奴役的危险。会议举起了为欧洲及其他国家的独立、反对美英帝国主义的侵害而斗争的旗帜，并号召各国共产党去领导为他们民族独立的斗争。一九四八年举行的情报局第二次会议，曾揭露了南斯拉夫共产党内资产阶级民族主义的恶疮，适时地揭穿了背叛民主与社会主义的铁托集团。共产党情报局关于南斯拉夫问题的决议，及反对资产阶级民族主义蜕化分子的无情斗争，使得世界共产主义运动中无产阶级国际主义的原则加强了，使得世界共产主义运动的行烈在马、恩、列、斯不朽的学说之基础上，进一步巩固了。
    一九四九年十一下半月在匈牙利开会的共产党情报局的决议，目的在于团结最广大的群众进行反对新战争危险的斗争。这些决议武装着共产党人、工人阶级及劳动人民去为和平、民主、各民族的民族独立和劳动人民的切身利益而斗争。这些决议揭露了帝国主义体系不可救药的病症，及帝国主义的进一步削弱。共产党情报局的决议加强了工人阶级对他们事业必然胜利的信心，说明了为伟大斯大林所鼓舞去为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的民主阵营底力量愈益增长。
