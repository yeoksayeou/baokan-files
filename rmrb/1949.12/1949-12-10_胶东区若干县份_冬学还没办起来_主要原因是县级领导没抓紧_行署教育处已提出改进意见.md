　　Jiaodong Area Several Counties
  　Winter Schools Have Not Yet Started
  　The Main Reason is That County-Level Leaders Have Not Paid Close Attention
    The Administrative Office of Education Has Proposed Improvement Suggestions
    [Report from our Shandong correspondent] The winter school work in some counties of Jiaodong is still just talk. The county has not established an education and culture committee, nor has it had unified leadership and arrangements, so that although the winter school has been called for many days, it has not been implemented in districts and villages. According to the inspection of the Jiaodong Administrative Office of Education, the main reason for the above phenomenon is that the leaders of some counties have not paid enough attention to the winter school movement; the education departments are carrying out this work in isolation. In some counties, only the education section convened a meeting of education assistants, and the education assistants returned to the district to convene a teachers' meeting, deploying it only through the education system; they did not actively suggest to the local responsible cadres to quickly establish and improve or hold education and culture committees at all levels to uniformly lead the winter school work. Now the Education Office has made suggestions to various counties to seize the opportunity of the winter slack season and quickly start winter schools.

　　胶东区若干县份
  　冬学还没办起来
  　主要原因是县级领导没抓紧
    行署教育处已提出改进意见
    【本报山东讯】胶东部分县份的冬学工作，至今还停留在口头上，县里没有成立文教委员会，没有统一的领导与布置，致使冬学虽已号召了许多日子，仍没有贯彻到区村。据胶东行署教育处检查，造成上述现象的主要原因是若干县份的领导方面，没有足够地重视冬学运动；教育部门孤立地进行这一工作。有些县份，只是教育科召开了教育助理员会议，教育助理员回区召开了教员会，单顺着教育系统布置下去；没有主动地向当地负责干部建议，迅速建立与健全或举行各级文教委员会，统一领导冬学工作。现教育处已向各县提出建议，抓紧冬闲时机，迅速地把冬学办起来。
