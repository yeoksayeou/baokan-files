　　Recent Situation of Zhangbei, Zhangjiakou, and Xuanhua
　　Investigation Report by the Tsinghua University Geography Group
　　The third and fourth-year students of the Geography Group of the Department of Geosciences of Tsinghua University, led by Professor Wang Chengzu and others, went to Zhangbei, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua and other places in Chahar Province for on-site investigation. They departed on October 15th and returned to school on October 23rd, lasting nine days. They took the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway to Zhangjiakou first, and then transferred to Zhangbei by car. Although the journey was not far, the geographical environment varied greatly. It can be said that it starts from the North China Plain in the south, reaches the edge of the Mongolian Plateau in the north, and passes through the transition zone between the two aforementioned areas, namely the intermountain basin of the southern Chahar hilly area. From low to high, from high to flat, then from flat to high, and from high to flat again, what we saw along the line was a clear profile.

　　The scope of the investigation was centered on Zhangbei, Zhangjiakou, and Xuanhua. The content of the investigation focused on agriculture, animal husbandry, water conservancy, soil, topography, urban development, transportation lines, and the lives of residents. Between the Mongolian Plateau and the inland areas, most of the Great Wall has collapsed, but the overlapping mountains still form a broad natural boundary.

　　Zhangbei: A place where agriculture and animal husbandry coexist. It is now the location of the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office, which governs eight counties including Zhangbei, Duolun, Shangdu, Kangbao, Baoyuan, Chongli, Shangyi. Taking the highway up the mountain from Zhangjiakou, once you pass Shenweitai, you can see the boundless north, with undulating wavy terrain, and belonging to the inland basin, so there are many lakes of all sizes, namely "Noer" in Mongolian. Furthermore, due to the high altitude and northern location, the temperature is lower than in Zhangjiakou. For example, on October 18th, there was ice everywhere, and the temperature recorded at the state-run farm ten miles northwest of Zhangbei County was as low as minus six degrees Celsius (on the same day, the lowest temperature at Tsinghua Garden in Beijing was 7.4 degrees Celsius). The soil is coarse sandy alkaline soil with low fertility, thin topsoil, and many gravels. Since the land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased, but due to backward production technology and the inability to immediately improve the level of education, productivity has not been fully utilized. Chabei is now in urgent need of research on the following topics: such as the limitations of afforestation by climate, soil, and residents' technical habits, but it is necessary to overcome them to prevent drought, floods, wind, sand, and soil erosion; improving agricultural tools and guiding farmers to use fertilizers to increase production is also an urgent task; supplying large quantities of cloth and cotton in exchange for local surplus grain to solve the clothing shortage; as for undeveloped grasslands, which use, agricultural or pastoral, is more suitable, should be determined by region, otherwise, reclaimed land may be easily flooded, or easily damaged and become barren land. We also investigated the Han-converted Mongolian villages, which fully demonstrated the love between ethnic groups, which proves that the Mongolian and Han people can absolutely get along friendly with each other. The Inner Mongolia pastoral area north of the Chabei Special Region was not visited this time due to the long distance.

　　Zhangjiakou: The political center of Chahar Province, located at the strategic point of the Qingshui (tributary of the Yanghe River) canyon. The urban area is located on the alluvial plain south of the canyon and straddles both banks. Its development is due to its transportation location, so its prosperity is mainly based on commerce, with limited industry. The Qingshui River is slightly curved, running from northeast to southwest, passing through Zhangjiakou City, so the streets west of the river are more northerly, and the streets east of the river are more southerly. The population has greatly increased since liberation, currently approaching 200,000. Goods come from the vast northwest, including fur, grain, mountain products, and medicinal materials, as well as industrial products from Beijing, Tianjin, and even Shanghai and Wuhan, all of which are gathered and traded here.

　　Geographical conditions have determined that Zhangjiakou is the "gateway" to the north. Its historical mission is like this, and it will continue to be so in the future. It has a bright future. Now that diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia have been established, the pressing issue is to develop transportation, develop Chabei, prosper Chanan, and connect Sino-Mongolian trade.

　　Xuanhua: The location of the Chanan Special Commissioner's Office, governing twelve counties including Wei County, Zhuolu, Xuanhua, Yangyuan, Tianzhen, Wanquan, Huai'an, Huailai, Chicheng, Yanqing, Longguan, and Sihai. The Chanan area is the most agriculturally rich and populous region in Chahar Province. It also possesses huge amounts of iron ore (Longyan Iron Mine) and coal mines (Xiahuayuan) and a large amount of hydropower (Huailai Reservoir project). In terms of agricultural production areas, there are the fertile Yanghe Valley, Sangganhe Valley, and other tributaries. In terms of transportation, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway runs through it, and highways extend in all directions. These are the most powerful geographical foundations for the economic development of Chanan.

　　Yantongshan Iron Mine and Pangjiabao Iron Mine in Longguan are collectively known as the Longyan Iron Mine Area. It is estimated that the total reserves reach 200 million tons. If this is true, it will be the second largest iron ore area in our country after Anshan, but the iron content of its ore is much higher than that of Anshan. Due to time constraints, this investigation could only reach Yantongshan, and only knew a rough idea of ​​the restoration and production status of its mine.

　　The development of Chanan should focus on agriculture and industry and mining. In the future, it will inevitably link the Longyan Iron Mine with the Datong Coal Mine and cooperate with the commercial city of Zhangjiakou, select a suitable location with the most economical transportation conditions to engage in smelting, develop heavy industry, and manufacture a large number of agricultural machinery to supply the needs of developing the agricultural economy of Chahar Province and the Great Northwest. Currently, the iron sand produced in Yantongshan is all transported to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and refined using coal transported from Datong and Tangshan. Originally, the most ideal condition for the development of the iron and steel industry is that the coal and iron production areas are very close; secondly, transporting iron to coal; and thirdly, both need to be transferred. At present, the Longyan Iron Mine and the Datong Coal Mine are the worst example, and a solution must be found urgently.

　　In summary, all regions have been liberated for a long time, and most of the obstacles that previously restricted economic development have been removed. All parties can engage in more investigation and research, and move forward in great strides on the road to economic construction.

　　This investigation received a lot of help from governments at all levels in Chahar Province, providing various conveniences in work. In particular, the provincial government lent sheepskin coats to keep out the cold and provided economic information. The heads of grain, enterprise, and fur companies and chambers of commerce in Zhang City also explained the recent situation of their business in detail to us. The Chabei Special Commissioner's Office specially solved the problem of food and accommodation; Commissioner Guo of the Chanan Special Commissioner's Office gave a comprehensive report on Chanan, enumerating industries, resources, population, crops, mountains, terrain, transportation, and even folk customs as if they were family treasures. In addition, Zhangjiakou Middle School, Xuanhua Middle School, and other schools gave great help. This enthusiastic assistance gave the investigators great encouragement and confidence, which was impossible before liberation. Obstacles before liberation, such as our field investigators being detained by the garrison (in Yunnan) and instruments being confiscated (in the suburbs of former Beiping), will never happen again. On the other hand, it fully demonstrates the spirit of cadres at all levels in the People's Government today, who are truly wholeheartedly serving the people, responsible to the people in everything, and solving difficulties for the people. They always hope that the investigators will provide opinions based on the investigation, and this humble attitude is especially admirable.

　　In the future, the country's economic construction has many things to be done, just as Chairman Mao said, it is only the first step in the Long March. For this reason, geographers can rest assured and boldly do it, engage in more investigation and research, systematically and step-by-step deeply and thoroughly understand the geographical environment of various regions of the country, and contribute their strength to the construction of New China.

　　张北，张家口，宣化近况
  　清华大学地理组考察报告
    清华大学地学系地理组三四年级同学，由该组教授王成组等率领，于日前赴察省张北、张家口、宣化等地实地考察，十月十五日出发至二十三日返校，历时九日。他们是沿京绥铁路先到张家口，再转乘汽车至张北，所经之路程虽不远，但是在地理环境上这一段地区差异是很大的。可以说南起华北大平原，北迄蒙古高原的边缘，中经上列两地带之间的过渡地带，即察南丘陵区之山间盆地。由低而高，由高而平，再是由平而高，由高而平，沿线所见，正是一个明显的剖面。
    考察的范围是以张北、张家口、宣化三地为中心。考察的内容是以农、牧、水利、土壤、地形、城市发展、交通线以及居民生活等为对象。蒙古高原与内地之间，长城大部已经坍毁，但是乱山重叠，仍然有一带宽广的天然界限。
    张北：为农牧并存之地，现为察北专署所在，辖有张北、多伦、商都、康保、宝源、崇礼、尚义等八县。由张家口沿公路上山，一过神威台，便北望无际，具有起伏的波状地形，且属内陆流域，所以大小湖泊分布甚多，即蒙语诺尔。更因地势高而又偏北，故气温比张家口还低。如十月十八日已经到处冻冰，张北县城西北十里之公营牧场气温纪录低至摄氏负六度（同日北京清华园之最低气温为摄氏七点四度）。土壤为质地很粗之砂硷土，肥力不大，表土层薄且多砾石。农民自土地改革后，生产情绪一般的提高，但由于生产技术落后，文化水平未能即时提高，致生产力亦未能充分发挥。察北现急待研究的有下列诸课题：如植林受气候、土壤以及居民的技术习俗等条件的限制，但为防止旱涝、风沙、土壤侵蚀，是必须克服的；改良农具指导农民引用肥料增加生产亦为当急之务；大量供应布、棉换取当地剩余之粮食以解决衣荒；至于未开垦的草原，农牧两种用法，以何者为适宜，应当分区决定，否则垦地或是易于被淹，或是反而易于遭受破坏，变为荒芜之地。又曾调查过汉化蒙古村，彼此充分表现着民族间的友爱，足可证明蒙汉人民间是绝对可以友好相处的。察北专区之北的内蒙游牧区，此次因道远未能前往。
    张家口：为察省政治中心，地当清水（洋河支流）峡谷之要冲，市区位于峡谷之南兼跨两岸的冲积平原上。它的发展是因交通位置的关系，所以它的繁荣是以商业为主，工业有限。清水河略有弯曲，为东北至西南向，余贯于张家口市，故河西街市偏北，河东街市则偏南。人口在解放后大有增加，目前将近二十万。商品有来自广大西北之皮毛、粮食、山货、药材，也有来自京、津甚至沪、汉之工业产品，皆以此为集散交易之地。
    在地理条件上决定了张家口是开向北方的“大门”，它在历史上的使命是如此，将来仍是如此。它有光辉的前途。现在中蒙邦交已经建立，刻不容缓的问题是要发展交通，开发察北，繁荣察南，沟通中蒙贸易。
    宣化：为察南专署所在地，辖有蔚县、涿鹿、宣化、阳原、天镇、万全、怀安、怀来、赤城、延庆、龙关、四海等十二县。察南区就察省而言是农产最富庶，人口最众多的地域。同时拥有巨量的铁矿（龙烟铁矿）和煤矿（下花园）及大量的水力（怀来水库计划）。在农产地域讲，有肥沃的洋河谷地、桑干河谷地和其他支流。交通方面有京绥铁路贯穿其间，公路四通八达。这些都是察南经济发展最有力的地理基础。
    烟筒山铁矿与龙关的庞家堡铁矿合称为龙烟铁矿区，据估计总藏量达两万万吨，如属确实则仅次于鞍山为我国第二大铁矿区，但其矿砂含铁量远比鞍山为高。此次考察因时间关系，仅能至烟筒山，对其矿场之恢复及生产现状知其大概。
    察南的发展，要以农业及工矿为主，将来势必将龙烟铁矿与大同的煤矿联系并与张家口商业都市相配合，在最经济的运输条件之下择一适当地位从事冶炼，发展重工业，制造大量农业机械以供发展察省和大西北农业经济之需。现在烟筒山出产之铁砂全运至石景山钢铁厂，用大同、唐山运来的煤提炼。本来钢铁工业发展最理想的条件是煤铁产地很接近；次者运铁就煤；再其次两者皆须转运。目前龙烟铁矿与大同煤矿就是一个最坏的例子，急须设法解决。
    总上各地区皆解放已久，以前束缚经济发展之障碍大多解除，各方面正可多多从事调查与研究，大步迈进，走向经济建设的大道。
    这次考察得到察省各级政府的帮助不少，予以种种工作上的便利。特别是省府借以御寒之羊皮大衣，供给经济资料。张市的粮食、企业、皮毛等公司以及商会的负责人，也都向我们详细说明业务近况。察北专署特为解决食宿问题；察南专署郭专员曾将察南作了一个综合性的报导，举凡产业、资源、人口、农作、山川、地势、交通以至民情风习历历如数家珍。此外如张家口中学、宣化中学等都给以很大的帮助。这些热情的协助，一方面给予考察者以莫大的鼓励与信心，这是解放前所不可能有的现象。解放以前的阻力，例如我们野外考察人员被驻军扣押（在云南），仪器被没收（在前北平郊外），从此都不会再发生。另一方面充分表现今日人民政府中各级干部真正全心全意为人民服务的精神，遇事对人民负责，替人民解决困难，总希望考察者就调查所得提供意见，这种虚怀若谷的态度，尤令人钦佩不置。
    今后国家经济建设，百端待举，正如毛主席所说的，只不过走了万里长征的第一步。为此地理工作者正可放心大胆的去做，多多从事调查与研究，对于全国各地区的地理环境作有系统的有步骤的深入而彻底了解，为新中国的建设贡献出自己的力量来。
