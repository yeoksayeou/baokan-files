　　How I Came to Understand Collective Learning
    Gu Fulù
    When I first started learning, I was someone who really disliked collective learning. I thought that while discussions could have some benefits, a group of people with similar theoretical levels couldn't really discuss anything of substance. For example, if someone raised a question, they wouldn't understand it, and others wouldn't necessarily understand it either. Even if a lot of time was spent, it would just be guessing and wouldn't solve the problem concretely. If there was someone with a high level of theory in a group, they would always be the only one speaking, and others couldn't refute them, so they would just have to listen. Although their opinions were mostly correct, if they were wrong, they could easily lead others in the wrong direction. It would be better to read more, consult more, and even ask for advice. Wasting time on everyone chiming in with their opinions was meaningless.
    Later, as the learning continued, I discovered more and more benefits of collective learning. At each stage, I discovered a new role for it, and I gradually corrected my previous dislike of collective learning.
    What are the benefits of collective learning? Based on what I've already experienced, it can be summarized as follows:
    (1) It can overturn things you've already accepted. Our reading habits are mostly to think, check books, and ask people when we have questions, and at the same time accept what we already consider "no problem." This is heartfelt acceptance, so we add it to our realm of knowledge as our own. If this is wrong, or if it's not inherently wrong but you have a wrong interpretation, and you absorb this wrong understanding, it's not easy to correct yourself without a considerable period of continuous learning. But with collective learning, what you saw tonight can be overturned in the morning discussion. This help is considerable. Not only can it help people avoid being poisoned by mistakes, but it can also give you a deeper impression of the correct things.
    (2) It can supplement your lack of reference materials. We all probably feel the same way about learning, especially part-time learning, which is that we don't have enough time to refer to other books. But it's always possible to do a few things. Collective learning is to gather each person's different "few" references and turn it into a "many" references. For a certain question, different people convey the content of different reference books, which saves everyone the time of personally referring to each book, and the question answered through collective effort is naturally more complete than an individual's. Even if everyone introduces the same book, the perspectives will be different. This is more meaningful than simply taking a passage as a "supreme truth" to explain the problem.
    (3) Often, when you think you can explain a problem eloquently, it ends up becoming inconsistent and you eventually abandon your own set of self-proclaimed brilliant explanations and listen to others' opinions because their understanding is deeper and can defeat your superficiality. If this happens a few times, it can quickly correct a person's insincere attitude towards learning. Being persuaded is painful for an insincere person, and because it is painful, it is helpful and truly beneficial to them.
    (4) Even the most naive questions or explanations of a term can spark in-depth discussions. Without this so-called naive question, those in-depth issues would be hidden somewhere and not discovered. Many people can't discover problems themselves, but they also despise the naive questions raised by others, which is not the correct attitude to learning.
    (5) "Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang." Cobblers may not always be able to explain a problem, but they are particularly good at questioning. That spirit of "getting to the bottom of things" is often something that "Zhuge Liang" doesn't have. Therefore, they can inspire Zhuge Liang and make him even more "resourceful."
    Collective learning can promote collective heroism, making you feel that falling behind is the most dishonorable thing, thus openly or secretly challenging or competing with others. The collective can supervise each other, making the advanced or backward more clearly exposed. Collective learning can spark interest in learning and change the individualistic flaws that old intellectuals have developed through long periods of individual learning, thereby accelerating their transformation.

　　我怎样认识了集体学习
    顾傅潞
    初参加学习的时候，我是一个很不喜欢集体学习的人。我认为互相讨论固然有一定的好处，可是在理论水准不相上下的一群人中，不可能讨论出什么东西来，比方说一个人提出了问题，他既不能了解，别的人也不见得了解，纵然费了很多时间，还是猜来猜去而已，不能具体的解决问题，若是有一个理论高的人在某一组呢，则永远变成他一个人发言，别人不能驳倒他，只好听他的，他们的意见虽然大多是对的，但如果不对时也就容易引导别人到错的方向去，不如自己多看书，多参考，甚至多请教人，把时间浪费到大家你一嘴我一嘴的讨论上，是没有什么意义的。
    后来学习的日期越多，我便越发现集体学习的好处，在每一个阶段中，都能发现它的另一种新的作用，于是我逐渐改正了以前不喜欢集体学习的态度。
    集体学习有什么好处呢？就我现在已经感觉到的，可归纳为下列几点：
    （一）它能把你已经接受了的东西翻案，我们读书的习惯，大多是有疑问时思索、查书、问人，同时把已经认为“没问题”的接受，这是心悦诚服的接受，于是便把它增入自己知识的领域，作为自己的东西，若是这是一个错的，或者本身不是错误的，而你有一种错误的解释，并把这种错误的认识吸收进来，除了经过相当长时期不断的学习，是不大容易自己纠正自己的，若是集体学习呢，今天晚上看的，明天早上一讨论就可能给你翻了案，这个帮助是相当大的，这不但可以使人少中错误的毒，并可以把正确的东西给你一个更深印象。
    （二）它能补助你参考资料之不足，我们学习，尤其是业余学习，恐怕都有一种同感，就是没有时间很充分地参考别的书，但少数的事总还可以办到，集体学习就是汇集每一个人不同的“少数”参考，变成一个“多数”参考，对于某一个问题，从不同的人口中传达了不同参考书的内容，这省却了每一个人亲自去参考每一本书的时间，而这个经过集体解答的问题，自然比个人的要完备，每一个人所介绍的参考书，即使是同一本书，看法也无不同，这样比单纯的拿一段来做为“至理名言”来解释问题又有意义的多了。
    （三）常常自以为对一个问题可以滔滔不绝的解释，结果变得不能自圆其说，终至放弃了自己那一套自以为高论的解释，去听人家的意见，因为人家更深入，那个深入足以击败自己的肤浅，这种情形发生过几次，就能很快的纠正一个人对学习不虚心的态度，被人说服对于一个不虚心的人是痛苦的，因为是痛苦的，所以对他有帮助，真的于他有益处。
    （四）最幼稚的问题或是一个名词的解释，都会引起很深入的讨论，没有这个所谓幼稚的发问，那些深入的问题便不知藏在什么地方，而不被人发现，很多人自己发现不了问题，却又轻视别人所提出的幼稚问题，也不是正确的学习态度。
    （五）“三个臭皮匠，赛过诸葛亮”，对于问题，臭皮匠有时不一定会解释，但却特别会怀疑，那种“打破砂锅问到底”的精神，往往是“诸葛亮”所没有的，因此，他能启发诸葛亮，使他变得更“足智多谋”。
    集体学习可以发挥集体英雄主义，使你觉得落后是最不光荣的，因而公开或不公开地向别人挑战或竞赛；集体可以彼此督促，使前进的或落后的更显明的暴露出来；集体学习可以提起学习的兴趣，改变一般旧知识分子因为经过长久的个人学习过程而养成的个人主义毛病，从而加速对于他们的改造。
