    Submit Letter to Chairman Mao
  	Reporting Early Completion of Production Plans
    The entire staff and workers of the Cement Factory, Light Bulb Factory, and Glass Factory, under the Dalian Sino-Soviet Far East Electric Power Company, have recently written to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, reporting that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and with the direct assistance of Soviet friends, they have completed and exceeded their annual production tasks for 1949 ahead of schedule.

    In their report to Chairman Mao, the workers of the Cement Factory said: We are delighted to report to you that from January to 7:40 PM on October 22nd, we have successfully exceeded the annual production task by 100 percent; reduced production costs by 23.8 percent, and improved quality by 14 percent. The report also stated that in the past ten months, to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day, "July 1st" Party Founding Day, celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, and celebrate the Soviet Union's great Socialist October Revolution, we have continuously carried out production competitions, demonstrating the high revolutionary heroism of all employees. During the production competition, the Cement Factory produced 19 production models in the Lüshun-Dalian area and 449 merit workers throughout the factory. These advanced producers played a leading exemplary role in exceeding the annual production task by 100 percent. The report concluded by saying that in response to the call of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP to launch a new production record creation movement, we guarantee to exceed the annual production task by 170 percent by the end of this year and begin repairing the first factory to prepare for even higher production tasks next year.

    In their report to Chairman Mao, the workers of the Light Bulb Factory said that in response to your call to "learn from the Soviet Union," we successfully completed the annual production task for 1949 at 4:30 PM on October 26th, during the process of welcoming the Soviet Union's great Socialist October Revolution; reduced production costs by 7.1 percent, and increased labor productivity by 15.3 percent; the number of defective products was also reduced by 4.25 percent compared to 1948. The report said that the achievement was due to your and the Chinese Communist Party's wise leadership, as well as the concrete assistance of Soviet friends. We have initially learned the scientific system and advanced technology of Soviet friends in managing industrial production. This is indeed something to be proud of. The great victory of the revolutionary war has given us great encouragement and enabled us to achieve victory on the production front as well. The report concluded by saying that we are not complacent because we have completed this year's production task. We must continue to work diligently to study and improve our skills, in order to strive to exceed this year's production task by 22 percent by the end of this year; and strive to continue to improve quality and reduce costs.

    In their report to Chairman Mao, the workers of the Glass Factory said that we wrote to you on this year's "July 1st" Party Founding Day guaranteeing to carry out overproduction equal to 35 percent of the annual production task. Now, we have completed 44.8 percent of this year's production task by October 31st. We are now making an even higher guarantee to you that by the end of this year, we will complete production tasks equal to 250 percent of the highest production volume before "August 15th" in 1945. The report also said that all the workers, technicians, and staff in our factory are very clear that the continuous increase in labor productivity is the result of our implementation of your instruction to "learn from the Soviet Union and follow the Russian path." We must continue to work hard, sincerely and humbly learn from the Soviet Union; and under your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strive to build a new industrialized China.
