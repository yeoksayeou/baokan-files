When the wheat was budding, Comrade Xiao Li, a worker, came to Li Hu's village. As soon as Comrade Xiao Li arrived, he got along with the young people. They sang songs, learned to read, and worked hard in the fields. These young people included Ju Chen, Lao Hai, and Dong Fu, all members of the militia squad; and Shun Yuan, He He, and Wang Luzi, who often joked around with Li Hu, and these people were broadcasters in the propaganda section. At first, Li Hu didn't know what was going on. After ten days or so, the village was in an uproar, saying that they were going to establish the "New Democratic Youth League," and the villagers also said, "This is like building a second Communist Party!" When the news reached Li Hu's ears, Li Hu thought: My wife, Xiao Xia, leads the women and has a good reputation, but what about me? I used to be a cadre, but my reputation was not good. This time, if I join the Youth League, I will regain my prestige. But how to join the League? There's no one to introduce me. I talked to Xiao Xia about it, and Xiao Xia frowned and said, "We're family, how can I ask someone else!?" Li Hu ran into a brick wall and became unhappy.

On May 4th, at lighting time, a mass meeting was held, and young people were to publicly register to join the League. The meeting place was in the village south school. As soon as Li Hu stepped into the meeting place, he saw Shun Yuan and a group of young people sitting on the rostrum, in front of the large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and above the portraits were six large red characters: "Youth League Registration Meeting." Li Hu watched from the side, feeling that these young people were a head taller than him. Then, he saw Xiao Xia also sitting in front of the women, smiling and talking to the women next to her. Li Hu was a little angry, so he turned his eyes elsewhere.

After the time it took to smoke three or four cigarettes, the yard was full of people. The meeting began, and the village branch secretary, Zhang Laowai, first explained the significance of the meeting, saying that they were going to establish the Youth League, just like the last time they publicly absorbed Party members, and everyone should keep their eyes open to see which young people could join the League. Then Comrade Xiao Li also said: "The Youth League is an organization of progressive young people, leading young people to produce, study culture, and do good things for the villagers.... Finally Comrade Xiao Li said: "Our village's conditions are mature, and many young people are asking to join the League, so today they can register at the meeting." After Xiao Li finished speaking, the League registration began.

The first to register was Wang Luzi. He stood up from the crowd, his excited face flushed, his chest puffed out as he raised his fist and said, "If I want to progress, I must join the League and do more good things for the villagers!" Although there were not many words, the villagers all nodded in agreement. Then Shun Yuan, He He, Fu Chen, Lao Hai, and Dong Fu also registered. The meeting place was slightly quiet for a moment. Several children were singing: "Young people, with fiery hearts, follow Mao Zedong forward! ..." Suddenly Xiao Xia also stood up to register. She frankly said, "I am a young woman and also want to join the League and progress. I am now a women's committee member and want to lead the women to turn over and seek liberation! If I'm qualified to join the League, please let the villagers review."

"Qualified!"
"She's a good wife!"

Lao Wai waved his hand to tell everyone to be quiet: "Now we're just registering. Whether you can join the League or not will be evaluated at the group meeting tomorrow."

Li Hu was still standing by the east wall. He thought to himself: I'll try to register too. I used to do the same work as Shun Yuan. Besides, my wife is still a cadre!? If I can't join the League and make progress, the villagers and wives will look down on me. As he thought, he felt energetic; but then he thought again: In the past, I used to use coercion when doing work, which caused dissatisfaction among the villagers. Even if I register, I might not pass the review. "If you can't catch a fox, you'll get a handful of stink," so it's not worth it! Thinking about this, Li Hu lost his energy again.

The meeting place was more lively than before, and the young people who had registered were already standing on the rostrum. People were talking to each other, saying: "These young people are all good!" "League members are reliable like Party members!" Lao Wai urged two more times: "Who else wants to register?" Li Hu's heart was pounding. Should I register? Or not? He asked himself repeatedly. Finally, he made up his mind: I'll try even if I run into a brick wall. Just as Lao Wai was about to announce that they would proceed, Li Hu shouted: "I also want to register, please let the villagers review..." The last few words were so soft that they could hardly be heard. Everyone turned to look east. Someone standing further away asked: "Who is that again?" "Li Hu!" "Li Hu who used to be a cadre in the militia company?" "Who else could it be!?" There was a commotion in the meeting place. People were laughing sarcastically, and some were saying: "He should take a piss and look at his own face!" Li Hu wanted to see clearly who was saying this about him, but he couldn't see anything in the dark. He only saw Xiao Li and Lao Wai looking at him with embarrassment, and Xiao Xia hiding her head behind a woman. Li Hu could no longer endure it! He watched the faces of the crowd stabbing at him like knives. He only felt his face burning hot, and his heart was as uncomfortable as if a puppy was scratching it....

Xiao Li told everyone to be quiet and turned to the chairman: "Call that Li Hu to the stage too!" The chairman called out twice, but Li Hu had already run out of the meeting place.

Li Hu slipped out of the meeting place and listened outside the wall. Everyone was saying that he was not good enough: saying that he scolded Old Man Sha from South Street when he used his position to send public grain by car that year. He was both sad and angry; sad that he shouldn't have been a cadre. He thought: My bad work style was only for the sake of work. If I plant my own land at home, I will never force you again! Then he heard someone say: "Scaring the villagers isn't enough, even his mother is always scaring people." A woman sighed. The voice sounded like Third Aunt from the east neighborhood saying: "Thank goodness he married Xiao Xia, that good wife. Since she became a cadre, her words are more acceptable, and she does a lot of work. Humph! She's exactly the opposite of him." Someone said: "Following him is bad luck!" The more Li Hu listened, the angrier he became. He ran home.

Back home, he tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The more he thought about it, the more he felt bad. The broadcast group was broadcasting the meeting situation, and it sounded like they were mocking him. He thought sadly: The villagers raised such opinions at the general meeting, so the group meeting will definitely say even worse things! He felt that he had no relatives now, heaven did not answer him, and the earth was not responsive. He thought: Is this what they call being divorced from the masses!?

After a while, the door rang. Knowing that Xiao Xia was back, Li Hu quickly calmed down. Xiao Xia came into the room and asked, "Are you asleep?" Seeing that no one answered, Xiao Xia groped for a match to light the lamp. Li Hu had a bellyful of anger and had nowhere to vent it, so he scolded, "What are you lighting the lamp for, damn it?" Xiao Xia was scolded, naturally unable to bear it, and retorted in a bad mood: "Who are you scolding? What did I do to you?"

"I'm scolding you! So what?"
"You're having bad luck and taking it out on me!" Xiao Xia sneered.

This sentence stabbed Li Hu's sore spot. Li Hu "swish" sat up, his facial features twisted as he asked with a frown: "How am I having bad luck?" Then he said: "I think you activists are too unrestrained!" Xiao Xia was heartbroken, tears welling up in her eyes. She wanted to argue but was afraid of waking up her mother-in-law, causing trouble for the neighbors in the middle of the night, so she temporarily swallowed her anger. She didn't even get on the kang and lay down on the long cabinet. Li Hu turned to face the wall, breathing heavily.

At the group meeting the next day, everyone disagreed with Li Hu joining the League and raised many opinions. The villagers agreed with the other people. After approval by the district Youth League Committee, an admission ceremony was held, and village representatives and Lao Wai also attended. Everyone encouraged the League members to be more progressive; the League members also swore an oath to the portrait of Chairman Mao: "Forever follow Chairman Mao, work hard, study, and be a good League member." That night, the broadcasting group promoted this matter again. Li Hu didn't go out for more than ten days, and didn't even want to step out of the house--his mother's face wasn't pretty either.

Once the Youth League branch was established, Li Hu felt that even more things were not going his way; the League members organized a work exchange group, and everyone talked and laughed, and working more was not tiring. But Li Hu was hoeing the land alone in the fields, and the more he hoeed, the less energy he had. When he had no energy, he would lie down on the edge of the field and sleep; the League members organized a self-study group, and Xiao Xia was elected as the group leader, and could learn three or five characters every day. Li Hu sometimes peeked at Xiao Xia's literacy book, but always felt unhappy; the League members told the villagers about the victory news. Although Li Hu often listened secretly, he always felt that it was not as respectable as others; what about Xiao Xia? Li Hu felt that she looked down on him even more--and that's how Li Hu started to get emotional. He was not active in production, quarreled with his mother every two or three days, and rolled his eyes at Xiao Xia every time he met her. Xiao Xia saw that something was wrong and sadly told the Youth League branch secretary Shun Yuan: "Shun Yuan! What should we do?" Shun Yuan asked: "What's wrong?" Xiao Xia said: "Isn't it because of that thing in my family being unsettled since the last time he failed to join the League? He hasn't been working hard lately and is always looking for trouble, scolding me countless times...." Xiao Xia said, wiping her tears. Shun Yuan didn't say anything for a long time, then frowned and said: "What can be done!?" Comrade Xiao Li was writing a letter on the side, and when he saw them crying and worrying, he smiled and said, "Is there a way?" He paused and then said: "This is our job! One of the tasks of the League is to transform people like Li Hu and help them change their shortcomings." Xiao Xia raised her eyebrows and said: "If he doesn't progress, how can we help him?" Xiao Li asked: "Why is he getting emotional now?" Shun Yuan thought for a moment and said: "Why? In the past, he was also a cadre and wanted to do a good job, but his method was not right. He was arrogant and had a tough style, and did not persuade the villagers. When we were herding sheep together as children, he always wanted to lead. This time, seeing us joining the League but he can't join, and also being criticized by the villagers, he became emotional." Xiao Xia said: "Shun Yuan is right!" Xiao Li said: "That's it! He wants to join the League and doesn't want to fall behind others, so that's a desire to progress! If he is arrogant and has a tough style, we must help him and not ignore him. We have adopted a public League building method, which is a practical education for everyone, but it also stimulated some young people who cannot join the League. Therefore, as soon as the League branch is established, it must do this work to make them know that as long as they work hard, they have the possibility of joining the League. We haven't done enough in this regard; also, in the future, League building should adopt the method of introducing through branch members." Xiao Xia and Shun Yuan listened intently. Xiao Li also said: "League members should be modest, not arrogant, and not first see the bad of non-League youth. You know: Li Hu came from a laboring background and also did work in the past. Because of coercion, he was opposed by everyone; he wanted to do his job well, but he didn't have enough ability, and being a young person, coercion came about. In the future, we will help him think of ways in his work and criticize him for not being arrogant, and he can change his shortcomings." Finally, Comrade Xiao Li instructed: "In addition to uniting and educating young people to make the League an organization for the broad masses of young people, League members should also unite the masses and listen to the leadership of the Party. Party members and League members are the locomotive, and they must also bring along the 'carriages' of the masses in order to complete greater tasks!" Shun Yuan and Xiao Xia nodded straight away after listening.

At night, Li Hu was still facing the wall, sulking, and Xiao Xia was a little troubled again. But when she thought of Comrade Xiao Li's words, she smiled and shook Li Hu and said, "You, what kind of evil spirit has followed you recently? Otherwise, people would say..." Li Hu suddenly turned over and asked fiercely: "What do people say?" Xiao Xia still said softly: "They all say your attitude is bad!" "My attitude is bad, have I killed anyone?" "You still want to kill someone? You're not active in production, your work style is bad, and you don't correct your shortcomings!" "Correct shortcomings? Correct what shortcomings!" Li Hu said with a frown. Then he stretched his voice: "Rotten wood can't become a material!" Xiao Xia said: "Look at what you're saying! Xiao Li and Shun Yuan asked me to help you, how can I help you with this attitude?" Li Hu was a little happy to hear that Xiao Li and Shun Yuan hadn't forgotten him, and quickly asked: "Help me do what?" Xiao Xia chuckled and said: "You're really asking an unreasonable question! Help you progress, everyone hopes you can improve!" Li Hu asked with a smile: "Really?" Xiao Xia pushed him: "Not really! Who would be coaxing you!" Li Hu asked: "What did they say?" Xiao Xia told him everything in detail. Li Hu listened attentively, feeling much more relaxed. Xiao Xia also reviewed herself: "In the past, my attitude towards you was also wrong. I didn't help you and just complained. Later, Xiao Li pointed out that this was wrong, so I changed it. Your shortcomings are not impossible to change, mainly your work style is bad, and you use coercion." Li Hu defended himself as if he had been wronged: "If I don't use coercion, I can't complete the work!?" Xiao Xia said, half angry and half laughing: "It's that same old thing of yours: the masses are backward! I can't do it without coercion! --I didn't change my attitude, and I still completed the work." Li Hu said embarrassedly: "Right! I'll learn from you in the future, the women have improved, please help me!" Xiao Xia was happy to see that Li Hu had changed his attitude and also had his strengths. The two people said some jokes and fell asleep facing each other.

Early in the morning, Xiao Xia reported to Xiao Li and Shun Yuan. After discussion, Xiao Li and Lao Wai assisted the Youth League branch in making a plan to educate and unite young people outside the League. The specific objects were determined, and the work was divided. Xiao Xia and Shun Yuan were responsible for helping Li Hu. In the evening, League members and young people outside the League held a meeting. Everyone said: We must help each other and make progress together; young people outside the League proposed: The Youth League branch should help young people outside the League more. Everyone learned three songs, and their mood rose. After the meeting, Xiao Li talked to Li Hu: "Li Hu, it's very good that you want to progress, but don't be arrogant, learn from the League members, learn from Xiao Xia. Show off less, do more work, don't work just to show off, just to join the League..." Li Hu said here: "Comrade Xiao Li, as long as you help me, I will resolutely correct my shortcomings, do before I speak, and not be arrogant and coercive." Xiao Li patted Li Hu on the shoulder and said: "Good! Li Hu, let's see how you work hard in the future, I hope you can join the League soon." After speaking, they parted at the crossroads.

With the help of Party members and League members, Li Hu made progress quickly, participated in the work exchange group, and worked ahead of everyone. He also got along with the villagers, and with the help of Xiao Xia, he also caught up with others in learning culture; but there were still shortcomings in his work. Once, the whole village mobilized the masses to fight locusts, and several old Taoist women burned incense and prayed. Li Hu kicked over the incense burner. For this matter, a League member meeting was held, and everyone criticized Li Hu for doing this wrong. Comrade Xiao Li spoke reasonably: "We must educate the masses who are superstitious, explain how locusts are produced, and educate them with the facts of fighting them, and don't use coercion. ..." Although Li Hu also made a self-criticism, he still couldn't understand: "Can superstitious people turn their brains around?" After the meeting, Xiao Li led everyone to explain to the superstitious old women: "Burning incense won't drive away locusts, they are not divine insects, it's better to fight them..." At this time, a young man ran to tell the old Taoist women: "Third Aunt! The locusts in other people's fields have been almost wiped out, and the remaining ones are all running to your un-attacked field, hurry up and fight them!" When the old woman heard this, she became anxious. She didn't burn incense anymore and asked everyone to help her fight them. The League members mobilized some of the masses, and in half a day, most of the locusts in the five acres of grain fields were eliminated. The old woman happily said: "The crowd is the real god! If everyone didn't help me fight them, my grain would have been eaten up." The facts educated the old Taoist women, and Li Hu was also convinced.

Li Hu no longer used coercion, and worked even more actively than before.

In July, the crops were spraying out the fragrance of ripeness. The sorghum spikes bent the stalks, the millet was like pieces of yellow velvet, the corn cobs suddenly poked out onto the roadside, the cotton flowers were red-mouthed.... The farmers were working like they were caressing delicate children, weeding, nipping buds, watering.... This year is really a good year!

On the 18th, after noon, groups of dark clouds surged in from the northwest, and the rumbling of thunder rolled over. Before it had blocked out the sun, bean-sized raindrops began to fall. The rain became heavier and heavier, and the sky and the ground were suddenly a vast expanse of white. At this time, there was not a single person to be seen inside or outside the village, except for Li Hu, who was leading a squad of the harvest protection team and guarding the crops separately. They guarded until dark, guarded until after midnight, and only when the rain stopped and another shift relieved them did they return home.

When Li Hu entered the house, Xiao Xia woke up and saw that there wasn't a single dry spot on his body, so she quickly took care of him and told him to lie down, asking: "It's raining so hard, and you still come down to the ground?" Li Hu was shivering and said: "The worse the weather, the more likely it is for bad elements to sabotage, so we should guard it more strictly!" Xiao Xia was satisfied in her heart and said: "Sleep! It's almost dawn." Just as she blew out the light, they heard someone shouting in the distance with a hoarse voice: "Villagers, the village south protection dam has been breached! Hurry up and block it!" When Li Hu heard this, he jumped out of bed and groped for his wet pants and ran out. Xiao Xia put on her clothes and chased him out.

Li Hu ran to the south of the village in one breath, and when he climbed onto the top of the dam and looked, he saw a stream of water gushing out of a groundhog hole. The water had already flooded the dam moat, and several old people couldn't stop it. At this time, he heard Xiao Xia and Shun Yuan running out of the village. He immediately thought of taking the lead, and shouted, "Take the lead! Take the lead!" He jumped into the water without taking off his pants.

He jumped too fiercely and was submerged as soon as he entered the water. The water turned him over and rolled him down again. He took two breaths and drank two mouthfuls of water. When the old men saw this, they shouted in fear: "Save someone! ..." Shun Yuan and his group arrived. At this time, Li Hu had already grabbed a stake and desperately used his buttocks to press against the hole, and the water flow became smaller. Shun Yuan and his group quickly pulled up crops, stuffing them in and stepping on them, and finally blocked the groundhog hole.

The sky was faintly bright. Hundreds of people gathered on the embankment. When the last person climbed from the water to the top of the dam, everyone realized that it was Li Hu. They saw that he was covered in mud from head to toe, one leg of his pants had been torn off, and he had broken two or three places on his legs and head, and blood was seeping down from the mud. The villagers crowded around, washing him, bandaging him, and everyone was shouting: "I never thought this child would put in so much effort for our village!" How much grain was saved!" "..." Li Hu didn't know what to do in this situation.

Li Hu fell ill when he returned home, and his body was burning hot. For three days, villagers came to see him every day, and some brought eggs. Xiao Li, Shun Yuan, He He, and other cadres also came. Li Hu was speaking deliriously from the fever, and Li Hu's mother and Xiao Xia were worried and helpless. Zhang Laowai brought a doctor, who took his pulse and gave him acupuncture, and he calmed down a little. Lao Wai stroked Li Hu's head and said: "This child has really turned around!" Xiao Xia said: "Isn't it everyone's help!" Shun Yuan said: "You helped the most!" Li Hu said a few delirious words, and when he woke up, he saw everyone surrounding him. He was very moved and said intermittently: "Sorry... for... everyone!" Everyone chattered and said: "Don't mention it, if it weren't for you, I don't know how much grain would have been flooded!" At this time, Xiao Li separated the crowd and announced loudly: "Li Hu! Your request to join the League has been discussed by the branch and approved by the district Youth League Committee and is fully accepted!" People listened quietly, there wasn't a sound in the room or the yard, and all that could be heard was the patient's difficult breathing. "When you recover from your illness, you must work more actively; be a good League member!" As soon as Xiao Li finished speaking, people immediately shouted: "He should join the League this time!" "Li Hu has changed for the better, no one has any objections!" Li Hu struggled to sit up and wanted to say something, but he couldn't speak, only his face was red and glowing.

　　李虎入团
    刘振声
    麦子正是莠苞的时候，李虎村里来了个工作员小李同志。这小李同志一到村，就跟伙子年青人拉扯在一块了。又是唱歌又是认字，地里的活也干的挺有劲。这几个年青人有聚臣、老海、冬福，都是民兵小队的队员；还有常跟李虎打闹的顺元、合合、王芦子，这几个人是宣传股的广播员。起先，李虎不知道有啥事，过了十来天，村里就轰动起来了，说是要建立“新民主主义青年团”，乡亲们也说“这是二建党啊！”消息传到李虎耳朵里，李虎想：自己媳妇小霞领导妇女们名誉挺好，自己呢？过去也当干部，名誉不好，这回入团，要争回自己的威信。但怎么入团呢？也没个人介绍，跟小霞讲了讲，小霞皱着眉说：“自己人，咋好向人家张口呀！？”李虎碰了个软钉子，就不痛快起来。
    阳历五月四日，点灯时分，开了群众大会，青年们要公开报名入团。会场在村南学堂里，李虎迈进会场的门头一眼就看见顺元一伙子青年坐在主席台上，毛主席朱总司令两幅大像的前头，像的上面还有六个大红字“入团报名大会”。李虎在一旁看着，觉得这伙子年青人比自己高出一头。又一转眼，看见小霞也坐在妇女的前头，笑盈盈的正跟旁的妇女讲说什么。李虎有点生气，就转眼去看旁处。
    三几袋烟的功夫，院子里坐满了人。开会了，村支书张老歪先讲明开会意义，说是要建立青年团，象上次公开吸收党员一样，大家要擦亮眼睛，看看那些小伙能入团。接着小李同志也讲：“青年团是进步青年的组织，领导青年生产学文化，给乡亲们办好事……。最后小李同志说：“咱村条件成熟了，很多青年要求入团，今天就可以在大会上报名。”小李讲完，大会报名便开始了。
    头一个报名的是王芦子，他从人群中站起来，兴奋的脸涨得红红地，小胸脯挺着举起拳头说：“俺要进步，就要加入团，多给乡亲们办好事！”话虽不多，乡亲们都听得点头。接着顺元、合合、福臣、老海、冬福也都报了名。会场上稍微安静了一下，几个孩子正唱：“年青的人，火热的心，跟着毛泽东前进！……”忽然小霞也站起来报名了。她坦然的说：“俺是个青年妇女，也要入团进步，俺现在当妇女委员，要领导妇女们翻身求解放！入团够格不够格，请乡亲们审查。”
    “够格！”
    “这是个好媳妇！”
    老歪挥着手让大家住嘴：“现在先报名，能不能入团，明天小组会上再评。”
    李虎还站在东墙边。他捉摸着：咱也报名试试，往常咱还是跟顺元一样工作，再说，媳妇也还是干部呢！？要入不了团进不了步，乡亲媳妇都看不起，他想着想着，劲头就足了；可是又一回想：往常做工作犯强迫命令，惹下了乡亲们的不满，报了名也不定审查上，“打不了狐狸惹股子臊”，才不上算哩！想着李虎又泄劲了。
    会场上比先前热闹了，报名的年青人已经站到主席台上。人们交头接耳的说着：“这伙子年青人都是好样的！”“团员跟党员没赖的！”老歪又催了两遍：“谁还报名？”李虎心里扑通通直跳，报名呢？还是不报？他反复问自己，最后他拿定主意：碰个硬钉子也试试。老歪正要宣布往下进行的时候，李虎喊：“我也报名，请乡亲们审查……”最后的几个字声音滑低的将听不见了。众人都扭头向东，站得远一点的有人问：“又是那一个？”“李虎！”“在中队部当过干部的李虎？”“不是他是谁！？”会场上一阵骚乱，人们用鼻子笑着，还有的说：“也该撒泡尿照照自己的模样！”李虎想极力看清都是谁在说他，黑暗里一点也看不清，只见小李和老歪难为情的望着他这方向，小霞把头藏在了一个妇女的背后。李虎再也不能忍耐了！他瞅着众人的脸象刀子一样的刺过来，他只觉得脸泼辣辣的热，心里象小狗抓的一样难受……。
    小李让大家安静下来，回头向主席：“把那个李虎也叫到台上来吧！”主席连叫了两声，李虎这时候早跑出会场来了。
    李虎溜出会场，在墙外面听听，大家都在说他不是：说他年上派车送公粮，骂了南街傻老斤。他又伤心又生气；伤心不该当干部，他想：我作风不好还不是为了工作，在家里耪我的大地再也不会强迫你们！随后听得有人说：“吓吓乡亲还不算，连他娘不也是大口吓吓。”一个女人叹着气，听声音象东邻三婶说：“多亏讨了小霞那个好媳妇，自当上干部说话更受听了，工作更不少作，哼！正跟他相反。”有人说：“跟上他就背兴了！”李虎越听越气，拔腿奔家走。
    回到家里，翻来覆去的睡不着。越寻思越不是滋味。广播组正广播开会情形，他听来好象在嘲笑他。他悲哀的想：大会上乡亲们还那样提意见，小组会上一定说的更难听哩！他感到现在自己没一个亲人，天不应，地不灵。他想：这就叫脱离群众吗！？
    一会门响，知道是小霞回来了，李虎赶紧镇静了一下。小霞进到屋里问：“睡着了？”小霞见没人答就摸索洋火点灯。李虎一肚子气正没处放，就骂道：“点你娘的灯干啥？”小霞挨了骂，自然受不得，也没好气的嚷：“你骂谁？我怎么你了？”
    “我骂你！怎么样？”
    “自己背了兴，在我身上出气呀！”小霞冷笑着。
    这一句话扎着了李虎的病根子。李虎“唰”的坐起来，五官挪位的拧着眉问：“我怎么背兴了？”随后说：“我看你们这些积极分子搁放不开了！”小霞气的心痛，眼里噙着泪花，又想吵又怕惊醒婆婆，三更半夜惹的四邻也不安生，就暂时咽下了这口气。炕也没上就躺在了条柜上，李虎翻身朝墙，呼呼的出大气。
    第二天的小组会上，大家都不同意李虎入团，还提了好多意见，其余的几个人乡亲们同意。经过区团委批准，举行了入团仪式，村代表和老歪也都参加，大家勉励团员要更进步；团员们也向着毛主席像宣誓：“永远跟着毛主席，努力工作、学习、作个好团员。”当天晚上，广播组又宣传了这事。李虎十几天没出门，连屋门也不愿迈出去——娘的脸色也不是好看的。
    团支部一成立，李虎觉得不顺劲的事就更多了；团员们组织拨工组，大家说说笑笑，多干活还不累，李虎却一个人在漫地里耪地，越耪越没劲。一没劲就躺在地头上睡大觉；团员们组织自学组，小霞当选了组长，每天能学三五个字。李虎有时候也偷看看小霞的识字本，但总觉得不痛快；团员们给乡亲们讲胜利消息，李虎虽然也常暗暗听，但总觉得不如人家体面；小霞呢？李虎觉得更看不起自己——就这么李虎闹起情绪来。生产不积极，三天两头跟娘吵架，跟小霞是一见面就翻白眼。小霞看样子不对头，就伤心的向团支书顺元告诉：“顺元！你说俺们怎么往下混？”顺元问：“怎么了？”小霞说：“还不是俺家那个东西自那次入团没准，这一阵子不干活尽找气生，骂过我不知道多少回……”小霞说着一面擦眼泪。顺元半天没言语，后来皱着眉说：“那有啥办法！？”小李同志正在一旁写信，见他们一个哭一个发愁，就笑着说：“有办法吗？”顿顿又说：“这就是我们的工作呀！团的一个任务就是要改造李虎这一派人，帮他们改缺点。”小霞扬扬眉说：“他不进步，咋好帮助？”小李问：“他现在为什么闹情绪？”顺元想想说：“为什么？过去他也是干部，也想做好工作，就是法子不对头。他骄傲作风硬，对乡亲们不说服。小时候，俺们在一块放羊，他总愿领头。这回见俺们入了团，他入不了，又受乡亲们批评，就闹起情绪来。”小霞说：“顺元说的对！”小李说：“这就是了！他要入团，不愿落在旁人后边，这就是要求进步！骄傲作风硬，我们就要帮助，不要不管。我们是公开建团方式，这对大家是个实际教育，可是也刺激了一部分不能入团的青年。那么，团支部一成立就要做这个工作，使他们知道只要自己努力，就有入团的可能。这点我们做的不够；还有以后建团要采取通过支部党员介绍的方式。”小霞顺元聚精会神的听，小李又说：“团员们要虚心，不要骄傲，不要先看到团外青年不好。你们知道：李虎是劳动出身，过去也做了工作。因为强迫命令，遭到众人反对；他想着把工作作好，可是能力不够，又是年青人，强迫命令就来了。以后咱在工作上多帮他想办法，并批评他不要骄傲，他能改缺点。”最后，小李同志叮咛：“团员除了团结教育青年使团成为广大青年的组织以外，还应该团结群众，听从党的领导。党员团员是火车头，还要把群众这“车厢”也带起来，才能完成更大任务！”顺元小霞听了直点头。
    晚上，李虎还是面朝墙呼呼生闷气，小霞又有点麻烦了。可是一想到小李同志的话，就笑着摇李虎说：“你这人，这一阵子什么丧神跟上你了要不人家都说……？”李虎忽的翻过身来气凶凶的问：“人家都说什么？”小霞还是细声细气的说：“都说你态度不好！”“我态度不好，杀过人吗？”“你还想杀人吗？生产不积极，作风不好，有缺点也不改！”“改缺点？改个毯！”李虎横眉直目的说。随后又拉长声音：“糟了的木头成不了材啦！”小霞说：“你看你说的！小李顺元让我好好帮助你，你这样的态度咋好帮助？”李虎一听小李顺元还没有忘掉他，有点高兴，赶紧问：“帮我干啥？”小霞扑嗤笑了说：“问的真没道理！帮助你进步，大伙都希望你改好！”李虎笑着问：“真吗？”小霞推他一把：“不真！谁还哄你！”李虎问：“他们都怎么说来？”小霞就一五一十的学起来。李虎静心听着，身上觉得轻松了许多。小霞也检讨自己：“早先我对你的态度也不对，不帮助只是抱怨，后来小李指出这不对，我就改了。你的缺点也不是不能改，主要是作风不好，强迫命令。”李虎受屈一样的辩白：“不强迫完不成工作呢！？”小霞半气半笑的说：“又是你那一套：群众落后啊！不强迫不行啊！——我没有动过态度，也一样完成了工作。”李虎不好意思的说：“对！以后跟你学，妇女们提高了，多帮咱吧！”小霞看李虎变了态度，心里欢喜说：“咱俩互相帮助，小李说：不怕有缺点，就怕不改过。有了缺点决心改就好！”李虎说：“你还是多帮咱，让小李同志也多帮咱。”小霞又觉得丈夫好起来，优点也有。两个人又说了阵笑话，就面对面的睡了。
    清早起来，小霞汇报了小李顺元。经过讨论，小李同老歪协助团支部做好教育团结团外青年的计划。具体确定对象，分了工。小霞顺元负责帮助李虎。晚上，团员和团外青年开了个会，大家说：要互相帮助共同进步；团外青年提出：团支部多帮助团外青年。大伙学了三个歌，情绪高涨起来。散会后，小李跟李虎谈话：“李虎你要求进步很好，但不要骄傲，要向团员学习，向小霞学习。少出风头，多作工作，不要为出风头才工作，才入团……李虎听到这里说：“小李同志，只要你们好好帮助我，我坚决改正缺点，作在前头说在后头，不骄傲强迫。”小李拍着李虎肩膀说：“好！李虎，看你今后努力怎样，希望你不久就能入团。”说完，就在十字路口分手了。
    在党员团员的帮助下，李虎就是进步不慢，参加了拨工组，干在大家的前头。跟乡亲们也说的来了，在小霞的帮助下，学文化也赶上了别人；可是工作中还有缺点。有一次，全村发动群众打蝗，几个老道婆烧香祷告，李虎踢翻了香炉。为这事开了个团员大会，大家批评李虎这样做不对，小李同志有条有理的讲：“群众迷信、一定要教育，说明蝗虫怎么产生的，并拿打的事实教育他，不要强迫。……”李虎虽然也做了自我检讨，但总想不通：“迷信的人能转过脑筋吗？”会后，小李率领大家去给迷信的老婆解释：“烧香烧不走蚂蚱，它不是神虫，还是动手打才是办法……”正在这时，一个小伙子跑来告诉老道婆说：“三婶！别人家地的蚂蚱都快打光了，剩下的也都往你们没打的地里跑，你快打去吧！”老婆一听可着了急，香也不烧了，要求大家帮她打。团员们就动员了一些群众，半天功夫，五亩谷地的蝗蝻大部被消灭。老婆欢喜的说：“众人才是神哪！不是大家帮着打，我的谷子都叫吃光了。”事实教育了老道婆，李虎也口服心服了。
    李虎不再强迫命令了，工作比以前更积极。
    七月里的庄稼，喷放着成熟的香气。高粱穗子压弯了杆子，谷子象一块块黄呢毯，大棒子突突的探到道沿上，棉花红着嘴儿……。农民们象抚爱娇儿样的作务着、拔草、打ｃｈà＠①、放水……。今年真是好年景啊！
    十八这天，过晌以后，西北上拥过团团黑云，雷声轰隆隆的滚过来，还没有遮没太阳的时候，豆大雨点就往下落。雨越下越大，天上地下顿时一片白茫茫。这时候村里村外了不见一个人影，独有李虎率领着护秋队的一个班正在分道看守着庄稼。他们一直守到天黑，守到过半夜，守到雨停了另一班换他们的时候才回到家来。
    李虎进到屋里，小霞醒来，看到他身上没有一点干地方，就赶紧照顾他躺下，问道：“下这大雨，还下地来？”李虎打着战说：“越是这天气，越有坏分子破坏，俺们应该越守的严！”小霞心里满意，说：“睡吧！天快亮了。”刚吹灭灯就听得远远的有人破着嗓子喊：“乡亲们，村南护村坝冲开了！赶快挡啊！”李虎一听，从被窝中一ｇū＠②碌就窜出来摸了湿裤子就往外跑。小霞穿好衣服，也追出去。
    李虎一气跑到村南，登上坝顶一望，一股水正从一个地羊窝里往外翻。水已经漫出了坝壕，几个老年人也挡不住。这时听得小霞、顺元也跑出村来。他立刻想起要带头，就嚷着：“带头！带头！”裤子也没脱掉就跳到水里。
    他跳得太猛，下水就没了顶。水把他翻上来，又把他卷下去，他换了两口气，喝了两口水。几个老头子一看，吓的大喊：“救人哟！……”顺元一伙子赶到了。这时候，李虎已经扒住了一根桩，用屁股拚命的压塞洞口，水势就小了。顺元一伙人嚓嚓的拔下庄稼，塞的塞踩的踩，才算把地羊窝堵住。
    天麻麻亮了。堤上集了几百号人，最后一个人从水里爬上坝顶时，大家才看出这是李虎。只见他混身上下都是泥，一个裤腿已经撕掉，腿上头上碰破了两三块，血浸透泥往下流。乡亲们拥上来。洗的洗、包的包，众人们嚷嚷着：“想不到这孩子给咱村出这么大力气！”保住了多少庄稼啊！”“……”李虎在这种情景下，倒闹的不知道怎么着才好。
    李虎回到家里就病了，身上烧的烫手。三天来，每天有乡亲们来看，还有拿鸡蛋来的。小李、顺元、合合别的干部们也来了。李虎烧的正说昏话，李虎娘跟小霞焦急的没法。张老歪带来了看病先生，看了脉、扎了针，才算安静一点。老歪摸着李虎头说：“这孩子可转变好了！”小霞说：“还不是大家帮助！”顺元说：“你帮助最大！”李虎说了一阵昏话，清醒过来，看见大家都围着他，心里非常感动，断断续续的说：“麻烦——大——家了！”众人嘁喳喳的乱说：“那里话，不是你，不知道淹多少庄稼呢！”这时小李分开众人，大声宣布着：“李虎！你入团的请求，经支部讨论，区团委批准，完全接受了！”人们静穆的听着，屋里院里没一点声音，只听见病人困难的呼吸声。“你病好了，要更积极工作；作个好团员！”小李话一住，人们立刻嚷起来：“这回可该入团了！”“李虎变好了，大家都没意见了！”李虎猛力坐起来，想说什么，可是说不出，只是脸红红的发着光彩。
