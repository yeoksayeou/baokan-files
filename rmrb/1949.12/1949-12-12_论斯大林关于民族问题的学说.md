　　On Stalin's Doctrine on the National Question
    Jiafuluofu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Tajik Republic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th] TASS reports: Jiafuluofu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Tajik Republic, published an article in Pravda on Stalin's great doctrine on the national question.

    Jiafuluofu pointed out: The Leninist-Stalinist national policy revived the oppressed nationalities of old Tsarist Russia, promoted their economic and cultural prosperity, and transformed them into progressive socialist nations. Jiafuluofu emphasized: The enormous progress made by the Central Asian republics in economic and cultural renovation proves Stalin's doctrine: peoples who have not gone through the stage of capitalist development can directly achieve socialism, skipping the tortuous stage of capitalism, with the help of the victorious proletariat in highly developed industrial countries. If it were not for the help of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, it would have been impossible for the cotton farmers of Central Asia to double or triple the output of cotton crops in a few decades. If it were not for the brotherly assistance of other nationalities of the Soviet Union, especially the Russian people, the construction of power stations, mines, manufacturing plants, and factories in Central Asia would not have been possible.

    Jiafuluofu then pointed out: The peoples of the oppressed nations in colonial and dependent countries, inspired by the example of the Soviet Union, have begun to believe in the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's doctrine on the national question. The victory of the Leninist-Stalinist national policy in the Soviet Union has inspired the people of all oppressed nations around the world to fight against imperialism, for freedom and independence, and for democracy and socialism.

    Jiafuluofu concluded: Stalin is the outstanding founder of the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the hundreds of millions of people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have created the economic and cultural prosperity of our great socialist country.

　　论斯大林关于民族问题的学说
    塔吉克共和国共产党中央委员会书记加福罗夫
    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔吉克共和国共产党中央委员会书记加福罗夫，在真理报上发表专文，论斯大林关于民族问题的伟大学说。
    加福罗夫指出：列宁、斯大林主义的民族政策，使旧日沙俄被压迫的各民族复活，使它们的经济文化繁荣发达起来，使它们成为社会主义的进步民族。加福罗夫强调指出：中亚细亚各共和国在经济与文化革新方面的巨大进展，证实了斯大林的学说：没有经过资本主义发展阶段的各族人民，在工业高度发展国家的胜利的无产阶级帮助之下，可以直接达到社会主义，跳过曲折的资本主义阶段。假如没有苏联各族人民的帮助，中央亚细亚各共和国的棉农，就不可能在几十年的时间内使棉花作物产量增加一、二倍。假如没有苏联其他各族人民，特别是俄罗斯人民兄弟般的援助，中亚细亚的电力站、矿坑、制造厂与工厂的建设，就不可能。
    加福罗夫接着指出：殖民地与附属国家被压迫民族的人民，因苏联的榜样，已开始确信列宁和斯大林对民族问题的学说之正确性。列宁——斯大林主义的民族政策在苏联的胜利，鼓舞了全世界各被压迫民族的人民去反对帝国主义，为自由与独立、为民主与社会主义而进行斗争。
    加福罗夫最后指出：斯大林是苏联各族人民友谊的卓越的建立者。在斯大林同志的领导下，苏联各民族的亿万人民造成了我们伟大的社会主义国家经济与文化的昌盛。
