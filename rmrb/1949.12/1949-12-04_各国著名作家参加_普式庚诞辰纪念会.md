　　Famous Writers from Various Countries Attend
    Commemoration of Pushkin's Birthday

    Many world-renowned writers gathered in the Soviet Union to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian poet Pushkin. They spent three weeks in Moscow and other places. Among them were the Danish veteran writer Martin Andersen Nexø, the famous Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, the Polish Leon Kruczkowski, the Chinese poet Xiao San, the British novelist Jack Lindsay, the famous German writer J. Becher, as well as many writers from Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Mongolia, Hungary, and the British black poet Peter Blackman, etc.

    The people of the entire Soviet Union warmly celebrated Pushkin's birthday and held large-scale commemorations. Foreign writers also expressed their thoughts and congratulations. Jack Lindsay said that he felt the Soviet people were full of joy in labor and the joy of art provided by labor. For the first time, the broad masses of the people are now uniting the spirit of the poet with their lives. The Italian writer Libero Bigiaretti said that the Pushkin celebrations he saw in the Soviet Union could not be seen in other countries, because there is no place in the world where literature can be loved so widely by the people. These foreign friends participated in the open-air celebration in Moscow, the commemoration at the Grand Theatre, and the conferences organized by the Academy of Sciences. They traveled to various memorial places related to Pushkin's creation and life, such as Leningrad, the location of Pushkin's tomb, etc. They also went to Stalingrad and Ukraine, Siberia and other places to visit the lives of the Soviet people. The writers believed that these trips gave them a deep impression, especially in terms of gatherings and contacts with people from all over the world.

    Danish writer Martin Andersen Nexø had not been to Moscow for many years. He was amazed to see many new buildings, wide boulevards, parks, and cultural palaces. But what he liked most was the people of Moscow, their calm confidence in the future, which was in stark contrast to the people of capitalist countries.

    Chinese poet Xiao San had been to the Soviet Union ten years ago. This time, he said, "What a great leap forward has taken place in the Soviet Union during this period! Here, nothing can be seen that can remind people of the recent war that destroyed so much construction. During my separation from the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has become richer and the lives of the people have become more pleasant."

　　各国著名作家参加
    普式庚诞辰纪念会
    许多世界著名的作家集合在苏联庆祝伟大的俄罗斯诗人普式庚的一百五十周年诞辰。他们在莫斯科和其他各地消磨了三个星期。他们之中有丹麦的老作家马丁·安特生·尼克赛，智利的著名诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达，波兰的里翁·克鲁兹考斯基，中国的诗人萧三，英国的小说家杰克·林德赛，德国的名作家Ｊ·白契尔，以及罗马尼亚、保加利亚、意大利、芬兰、荷兰、挪威、蒙古、匈牙利的许多作家，和英国黑种诗人彼得·勃拉克曼等。
    全苏联人民热烈庆祝普式庚的生日，举行了大规模的纪念会。外国作家们也发表了感想和祝辞。杰克·林德赛说，他觉得苏维埃人民充满了对劳动的欢乐，和对劳动所提供的艺术的欢乐。广大的人民现在第一次使诗人的精神和他们的生活结合起来。意大利作家里勃罗·巴吉亚莱蒂说，他在苏联所见到的普式庚的庆祝会是不可能在别的国家看到的，因为世界上没一处地方的文学能够受到人民这样广泛的爱好。这些外国友人们参加了莫斯科的露天庆祝大会，大戏院的纪念会，以及科学院所组织的会议。他们旅行到与普式庚创作和生活有关的各个纪念地方去，如列宁格勒，普式庚的坟墓所在地等。他们更到斯大林格勒和乌克兰，西比尔斯克等地去参观苏联人民的生活。作家们认为这些旅行给他们很深的印象，特别是各地人民的集会和接触方面。
    丹麦作家马丁·安特生·尼克赛已经好几年没有到莫斯科去了，他惊异地看见许多新的建筑物，宽广的林荫道、公园和文化宫。可是他最喜欢的是莫斯科的人民，他们对未来的沉着的信心，他们与资本主义国家的人民有着强烈的对比。
    中国诗人萧三在十年之前到过苏联，这次重来，他说：“在这一时期内，苏联发生了多么伟大的飞跃啊！这里已经看不见什么东西还能够使人记起最近的破坏了许多建设的战争。在我和苏联的分别期间，苏联变得更富足了，人民的生活变得更愉快了。”
