　　Breeding and Maintaining the Purity of Superior Cotton Varieties
    Zhang Guangju

    North China is a key cotton-producing area in the country, and cotton improvement work has a history of several decades. Therefore, it has a certain amount of experience and a set of working methods that have been adopted for a long time. After the liberation of Beijing, we took over various businesses of the Beiping branch of the pseudo-Agricultural and Forestry Department's Cotton Improvement Office and transformed and developed them on the original basis. In the liberated areas, professional handling of cotton improvement is still a brand-new issue. In order to actively create working methods that adapt to the new society and are needed by the masses, after a year of exploration, we have found the following points of experience regarding the breeding and maintenance of pure varieties, which are provided for everyone's reference. Whether they are correct or not still needs further research in the future.

    I. Promotion and Management of Improved Varieties

    The promotion and maintenance of pure varieties has always been one of the focuses of cotton improvement. The quality of cotton seeds has a great impact on cotton yield and quality. For example, the planting of Si Zi Cotton 2B in Wu'an has achieved great results due to the mass selection of improved varieties: First, the yield increased by 20%; second, the ginning percentage is high, with 37 to 42 jin of lint cotton produced from every 100 jin of seed cotton; third, the fiber is long, and each jin of lint cotton sells for 1.5 jin more millet than ordinary Xiaoyanghua (i.e., degraded American cotton), and the total harvest is doubled compared to Xiaoyanghua. Maintaining the pure strain of cotton is more difficult than ordinary edible crops. First, cotton is a crop that is easily cross-bred; second, cotton is almost purely for commercial production and must be processed. Therefore, the maintenance of pure cotton strains must have a strong organization and management work to avoid mixing and degradation. The establishment of improved seed management areas is completely correct and very necessary, because we are different from socialist countries and cannot rely on a large number of state-owned farms and collective farms to breed pure strains. It is also different from capitalist countries, which can rely on capitalists to do seed business and operate farms to breed improved varieties. Under our current decentralized small-scale peasant economy, we must delineate certain areas and villages with better conditions, organize the masses, and concentrate on planting a single improved variety, and designate them as improved seed management areas (i.e., cotton planting guidance areas), set up technical cadres to conduct special guidance and management. Give loans, prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and provide guidance on cultivation techniques, as well as assistance such as preferential prices for good cotton. Oppose the intrusion of non-improved varieties, and conduct culling of inferior and impure strains where conditions permit. After breeding a large number of pure and improved seeds, in the second year, they are promoted and planted in relatively lower-level cotton areas, and this is promoted piece by piece, year by year. Conversely, like other agricultural crops, if they are promoted in a scattered manner, even the best seeds will become mixed varieties after one year.

    　　　　II. Seed Selection Campaign

    First, Selection and Separate Harvesting Campaign: The Si Zi 2B cotton seeds that we received from the pseudo-Cotton Improvement Office had been bred and promoted in the Beijing-Tianjin area for two or three years, and had become quite seriously mixed. The purity was generally only 60% to 70% (a few retained a purity of 90%). The essence of Si Zi 2B cotton is good, but after such mixing, although it is still better than ordinary Xiaoyanghua, it can hardly be called an improved variety, and it is even more inferior to the better Si Zi Cotton No. 4 cotton seeds near Shijiazhuang City. Because we lacked improved seeds and did not thoroughly check the purity of this batch of cottonseeds, we boldly promoted them this spring. In areas where the original cotton quality was poor, it was generally welcomed; in the old No. 4 promotion areas, especially in areas where the purity of No. 4 was better, it was opposed by the masses. This also caused some comrades to doubt the excellent nature of Si Zi 2B cotton. In order to maintain the pure strain of Si Zi 2B cotton and ensure the increased production of high-quality cotton next year, we attempted to launch a culling of inferior and impure strains. However, this method required the removal of 30% to 40% of the cotton plants, which was too great a loss for the masses, and the state was unable to cover this huge compensation cost, so it could not be implemented. Therefore, it was decided to launch a selection and separate harvesting campaign in the 200,000 mu of Si Zi 2B cotton fields that had already been promoted this year. The Cotton Improvement Office itself, all the technical personnel of the cotton planting guidance areas, and some technical personnel of the Cotton Department of the Agricultural Science Research Institute, and the cotton professors of the two agricultural colleges of Peking University and Tsinghua University formed a cotton work team, went to the improved seed management areas, combined with the promotion teams of the farms in various regions, to carry out the seed selection work. They separately investigated different situations, mobilized and organized the masses to carry out whole-field seed retention, separate harvesting of mixed and inferior strains, and single-plant seed retention, and cooperated with high-priced purchase of selected cotton (because the grade of selected cotton is high), resulting in a great improvement in the purity of improved varieties. According to the results of our purity test, the original purity of about 60% has been increased to more than 80%.

    Second, Organizing Seed Saving by Farmers: Those who have been doing cotton improvement work have generally not believed that the masses can maintain pure strains. Every year, after the autumn harvest, all the improved cotton is recovered, processed by their own ginning mills, and then the cotton seeds are loaned to the masses. Experience has proved that this is a kind of thinking and practice that lacks a mass perspective. This year, we have universally organized the masses to save seeds themselves in all improved seed promotion areas, which has been welcomed by the broad masses. Most of the masses have mastered the seed selection technology and selected pure seed cotton for seed retention. According to the results of the investigation, the seeds selected and harvested by farmers in Tongxian, Wu'an, and other places generally have a purity of more than 90%. In particular, the germination rate has greatly increased, which is an important guarantee for seedling emergence next year.

    Third, Seed Selection Campaign in General Cotton Fields: Not only is the quantity of raw cotton for textiles insufficient, but the quality is also too poor. Domestic long-staple cotton is not enough for yarn mills to use and must rely on foreign cotton. Therefore, how to quickly improve the quality of raw cotton is a major issue facing us. In the past, North China had widely promoted Si Zi Cotton No. 4. Although it has been mixed and degraded over the years, it is still better than the generally degraded American cotton. According to the results of the investigation, some areas still maintain a purity of more than 70%, such as Liuying Village in Shijiazhuang City, Dahan in Anyang, Qiliying in Xinxiang, and Qu Zhuangtou in Jiexian. Therefore, in such areas, a policy of trying to improve one step on the existing basis was determined, and a wide-ranging mass seed selection campaign was organized, combined with preferential prices for the purchase of selected cotton and selected cotton seeds. According to the report of the Fenyang Special District in Shanxi, 3 million jin of seeds have been selected. It is estimated that there will be about 1 million mu of cotton fields in North China next year with a purity of about 70%, which can be used as breeding objects for improved varieties; and the purity of about 4 million mu will be generally improved. If seed selection is carried out continuously for more than three years, and combined with the policy of preferential prices for high-quality cotton and strengthened technical management, it is very likely to select millions of improved varieties. The key to completing this task must be that all staff, especially some technical personnel, have a strong belief in relying on the broad masses to quickly improve the quality of raw cotton. At first, some technical personnel did not believe that the masses could select good seeds, thinking that the masses did not know cotton. Later, in actual work, experience proved that farmers, especially experienced farmers, not only know the good and bad of cotton, but also have the ability to identify varieties, which is several times stronger than our technical cadres, especially young technical cadres. Because they have been planting cotton year after year, and many people have been planting for decades. It's just that the names they call are local names based on the characteristics of cotton development (such as calling Si Zi Cotton No. 4 "Big Shoulder Pole"), and they don't understand academic names and lines. If our technical personnel, through the method of enlightenment and guidance, instill scientific seed selection knowledge, they will not only easily accept it, but also do it better.

    The basic reason why the seed selection campaign can succeed is that the masses all know that cotton with good varieties has a large yield and a high price, which is closely related to the interests of the masses. Farmers have the disadvantage of being seriously conservative, and they often have great doubts about changing to a new variety. This is because farmers only have a few acres of land to rely on for their livelihood, and if they adopt a new variety, they will suffer a crop failure due to unsuitability to the local conditions, and their lives will be immediately affected. Their concerns are inevitable. However, once a certain variety is considered excellent and accepted, they are unwilling to give it up easily. Local seed selection, local breeding and promotion, just breaks the farmers' certain concerns and adapts to the farmers' requirements. More importantly: We have found a large number of new varieties with excellent quality that can be used as breeding objects from the seed selection, such as selecting long-staple cotton with a fiber length of 1 9/16 inches from the Si Zi 2B cotton in Chengci, and the uniformity is also quite good. Such high-quality cotton is rarely seen (of course, it may be a special variation, and whether it can be fixed needs to be proved by future experiments). Other areas have also selected a considerable amount of 1 1/4-inch cotton seeds. In short, I think that organizing seed selection can not only maintain the quality of seeds, but also improve and enhance it. It should be implemented as a direction and route. It is more economical and reliable than buying cotton seeds from abroad. Whether it is correct or not, I would like to arouse the research of comrades.

    III. Cotton Harvesting and Maintaining Purity

    If the improved seed management work is done well and good cotton is harvested, in addition to the masses saving seeds themselves, the next step is how to purchase the seed cotton in order to master a large number of seeds for expanding promotion in the coming year. Therefore, strengthening the organization of special purchases of improved seed is also a key to maintaining the purity of improved varieties. We have reached an agreement with the textile and cloth company that the improved seed cotton will be uniformly organized and purchased by the Cotton Improvement Office as an agent. The textile and cloth company will give priority to supporting the purchase funds and give a one-level price increase as preferential treatment. This will ensure that the improved seed cotton can be continuously entered into the ginning mill, so that the manipulation of merchants will not suppress the price of good cotton and affect the promotion, and the merchants will not deliberately seize and control good cotton and take exorbitant profits, causing a large loss of improved varieties. In terms of purchase methods, the following methods are generally adopted: First, if the cooperative has a foundation, it relies on the cooperative for purchase and processing. For example, in Wu'an County, not only is the county cooperative strong, but almost every village has a cooperative. Who grows improved cotton and who has good or bad cotton can be controlled by the village cooperative, so that the phenomenon of adulteration for high prices in the purchase cannot occur. Especially in the case where the masses love improved varieties, the mass supervision ensures that the improved varieties will not be lost, which greatly increases the breeding multiplier (in Huafu Village, Wu'an County, 100 mu of improved varieties were planted in the first year, and it can be expanded to 900 mu in the second year). Second, in areas where the cooperative does not have a foundation, the ginning mill of the Cotton Improvement Office directly purchases it. In addition to strict grading and inspection, it is more important to have the direct cooperation of promotion personnel, which can greatly reduce the mixing of non-improved varieties. Third, entrust the cooperative to collect on behalf of the Cotton Improvement Office, and the promotion personnel cooperate with it. The ginning mill of the Cotton Improvement Office processes it, or the ginning mill jointly run by the Cotton Improvement Office and the cooperative processes it. This cooperative method is convenient for the cooperative to obtain the technical assistance of the promotion personnel, and it is also convenient for the Cotton Improvement Office to supervise the cooperative, which is much better than the way the textile and cloth company directly entrusts the cooperative to purchase improved varieties.

    IV. Processing and Maintaining Purity

    Processing is one of the important keys to maintaining the purity of cotton seeds. We have supplemented and reorganized the five power ginning mills and one manual ginning mill that received the pseudo-Cotton Improvement Office, and built five new power ginning mills and one manual ginning mill, specializing in the processing of improved varieties. The ginning mill is an enterprise and implements cost accounting. The result of this implementation, according to the current situation, is that the ginning mill can not only break even but also make a little profit (of course, very small). This ensures that the ginning mill can expand the fund year by year and master more improved varieties. After a few years, it can complete the task of improved seed processing without relying on agricultural loans, and in essence plays the role of a seed company. But it is by no means the same as a merchant's purely profit-oriented management, but mainly universally selects seed cotton, checks out identifiable mixed cotton fibers, and stiff petals caused by diseases and insect pests. After the seeds are ginned, they are screened twice to screen out the mixed, inferior, and degraded small black seeds and small green seeds. Such processing also greatly improves the seed purity and raw cotton quality. According to our experience, the cotton in the improved seed management area, which is specially used for breeding, must be processed centrally in the ginning mill directly led or supervised by the cotton improvement organizations at all levels (this ginning mill must not only have technical guidance, but also economic (even at the cost of loss if necessary) and political guarantees), or entrusted to a strong and guaranteed cooperative that accepts technical guidance to handle it. The ginning mill of the Cotton Improvement Office can only gin the cotton produced in the basic improved seed breeding area of 10,000 to 20,000 mu. With the expansion of the promotion area, it is necessary to strengthen the power of the cooperative to organize more small ginning mills to complete the task of mastering improved varieties and expanding promotion. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the organization and management of private ginning mills. Currently, there is very little experience in this area, and it can only be put forward as a problem for research.

　　优良棉种的繁殖与保纯
    张广居
    华北为全国产棉重点，棉产改进工作也有几十年的历史，因而它具有一定的经验与长时间所采用的一套工作方法。当北京解放后，我们接收了伪农业林部棉产改进处北平分处的各种业务，并在原有基础上加以改造发展。在解放区说来，专业办理棉产改进，还是个崭新的问题。为积极创造以适应新的社会而为群众所需要的工作方法，经过一年来的摸索，关于良种繁殖与保纯，找到了如下几点经验，提供大家参考。正确与否，还有待于今后进一步的研究。
    一、良种的推广与管理
    良种的推广和保纯，历来便是棉产改进的重点之一。棉种的良莠，对棉花产量质量影响甚大，如武安种植斯字棉二Ｂ，由于群众精选良种得到很大的成绩：一为产量提高百分之二十；一为衣分高，每百斤籽棉出皮棉三十七斤到四十二斤；一为纤维长，较一般小洋花（即退化的美棉）每斤皮棉多卖一斤半小米，总的收获较小洋花提高一倍。棉花纯种的保持，较一般食用作物困难，第一棉花是容易杂交的作物；第二棉花几乎为纯商品生产，须经加工。所以棉种的保纯，必须有强有力的组织与管理工作，以避免混杂退化。良种管理区的设置，是完全正确与十分必要的，因为我们不同于社会主义国家，可依托大量的国营农场、集体农场去繁殖纯种。也不同于资本主义国家，可依靠资本家做种子生意、经营农场去繁殖良种。在我们目前分散的小农经济下，必须划定一定的、条件较好的区村，组织群众，集中普遍的种植一种良种，划为良种管理区（即植棉指导区）设置技术干部，进行专责的指导和管理。并给以贷款，防除病虫害和栽培技术的指导，以及良棉优价等援助。反对非良种侵入，有条件的进行去伪去劣。繁殖出大量的纯良种子后，第二年把他们推广种植在比较低级的棉区，这样推进下去，逐年逐步地、一片一片的作面的推广。反之，象其他农作物一样的分散推广，再好的种子，经过一年，也会变为杂种。
    　　　　二、选种运动
    第一、选良分收运动：我们接收的伪棉产改进处所繁殖推广的斯字二Ｂ棉种，是经过在京津地区二、三年的繁殖，已经相当严重的混杂，纯度一般只到百分之六十至七十（有少数的保有百分之九十的纯度）。斯字二Ｂ棉本质是好的，经过这样的混杂，虽仍较一般小洋花为好，但也几乎不能称其为良种，比之于石家庄市附近较好的斯字棉四号棉种，则更大有逊色。我们因为缺乏良种，与对此批棉籽纯度检查不周，今年春季大胆的把他推广出去了。在原来棉花品质较差的地区，一般还受欢迎；在旧有四号推广区，尤其是四号纯度较好的地区，则遭到群众的反对。因而也引起一部分同志对斯字二Ｂ棉本质优良的怀疑。我们为保持斯字二Ｂ棉的纯种，保证明年优良棉花的增产，曾企图发动去伪劣。但这种办法须拔去棉株的百分之三十到四十，群众损失太大，国家又无法开支此一笔庞大的补偿损失费，以致未能行通。于是，即决定在今年已推广的二十万亩斯字二Ｂ棉田内，发动选良分收运动，由棉产改进处本身与各植棉指导区的全部技术人员，及农业科学研究所棉作系的一部分技术人员，北大、清华两农学院的棉作教授，组成棉产工作团，分赴各良种管理区，结合各地区农场的推广队，进行良种的选种工作。分别查清不同情况，发动与组织群众，进行全田留种，杂劣分收、与选株留种，并配合以高价收买选种棉花（因选种花品级均高），结果使良种纯度大大提高。据我们经过考纯试验的结果，原来纯度在百分之六十左右的，都提高到百分之八十以上。
    第二、组织自留种：历来做棉产改进工作的，大都不相信群众会保持纯种，每年都是秋后把良种棉花全部收回，经过自己办理的轧花厂加工后，再把棉籽贷给群众。经验证明，这是一种缺乏群众观点的思想与做法。我们今年在所有良种推广区内，普遍的组织了群众的自留种，受到了广大群众的欢迎。多数群众都能掌握了选种技术，选出纯正的籽棉留种。据考查的结果，通县、武安等地农民选收的自留种，一般纯度均在百分之九十以上。特别是发芽率大为增高，对明年捉苗有了重要的保证。
    第三、一般棉田的选种运动：纺织原棉不仅数量不足，而且质量太差。国产长绒棉花不够纱厂使用，须依赖外棉，因之，如何迅速提高原棉质量，是摆在我们面前的一个重大课题。华北区过去曾大量推广过斯字棉四号，虽经过几年来的的混杂退化，但仍较一般退化了的美棉为好。据调查的结果，某些地区仍保持着百分之七十以上的纯度；如石家庄市的留营村、安阳的大寒、新乡的七里营、解县的曲庄头等。因之，在这样的地区确定了在现有基础上设法提高一步的政策，组织了广泛的群众性的选种运动，并结合着优价收购选种棉花与选种棉籽。据山西汾阳专区报告，选种已达三百万斤。估计华北全区明年有纯度在百分之七十左右，可当作良种培植的棉田约达一百万亩；纯度一般提高的有四百万亩左右。如果连续进行三年以上的选种，并配合以优棉优价政策及加强技术管理，选出数百万良种，是很可能的。这一任务完成的关键，必须是一切工作人员，尤其是有些技术人员，已有了依靠广大群众迅速提高原棉质量的坚强信念。最初有些技术人员不相信群众会选好种，以为群众不认识棉花，后在实际工作中，经验证明了农民，尤其是老农，不仅懂得棉花好坏，而且有识别品种的能力，比我们的技术干部，尤其是青年技术干部，要强过几倍。因为他们年年种棉花，许多人是种了几十年，只是他们叫的名称是根据棉花发育性状的特征，自己起的土名（如把斯字棉四号叫作大扁担），不懂学名品系等而已。如果我们的技术人员，经过启发诱导的方法，贯输以科学的选种知识，他们不但容易接受，还会做得更好。
    选种运动之所以能够成功的基本原因，是群众都懂得品种好的棉花产量大，价格高，和群众利益密切关连。农民是有其严重保守性的缺点的，每换一种新的品种，往往抱着极大的怀疑。这是因为农民仅有的作为生活依靠的几亩土地，万一采用一种新的品种，因不适风土而歉收，生活便会立即受到打击，他们的顾虑是必然的。然而一旦对某一品种认为优良而被接受之后，又不肯轻易放弃。就地选种，就地繁殖推广，正好打破农民某种顾虑，适应农民的要求。更重要的是：我们从选种中找出来大量的品质优良的、可当作培育对象的新品种，如在成磁的斯字二Ｂ棉中选出来一又十六分之九英寸的长纤维棉花，整齐度亦相当好，如此品质优良的棉花，还很少见到（当然可能是特殊变异，能否固定，须待以后试验的证明）。其他地区，也选出了相当大量的一又四分之一英寸的棉种。总之我认为组织选种，不仅可使种子品质保持而且还可能有所提高与增进，应当作一个方向路线来贯彻推行，此之于从国外购买棉种，既经济而又有把握，正确与否，愿引起同志们的研究。
    三、收花与保纯
    良种管理工作做好了，收获了好的棉花，除群众自留种外，紧接着就是如何把籽棉收买起，来掌握到大量的种子，以备来年扩大推广。因之加强组织良种的专门收购，也是良种保纯的一大关键。我们和花纱布公司取得协议，良种籽棉由棉改处统一组织代理收购，花纱布公司优先给以收购资金的支持，并给以提高一级的加价优待，这样就保证了良种籽棉可源源收入轧花厂，不致因商人的操纵，压抑良棉价格而影响推广与因商人故意夺购掌握良棉，借取暴利，使良种大量散失。在收购方法上一般的采取了如下的几种做法：一、合作社有基础的即依托合作社收购和加工，象武安县不仅县合作社力量大，且几乎村村有合作社。谁种的是良种棉花，谁的棉花好坏，村社都可以掌握了，使收购中为卖高价而搀杂的现象无法产生。特别是在群众热爱良种的情况下，群众性的监督，使良种不致流散，大大的提高了繁殖倍数（武安县花富村第一年种了一百亩良种，第二年即可扩大为九百亩）。二、合作社没有基础的地区，即由棉产改进处的轧花厂直接收购，除严格的进行分级检验外，更重要的是有推广人员的直接配合，这样可以大大减少非良种的混入。三、委托合作社代收，推广人员予以配合，由棉产改进处轧花厂加工，或由棉产改进处与合作社合办之轧花厂加工。这种合作办理的方式，合作社便于取得推广人员的技术帮助，同时也便于棉产改进处对合作社的监督，比花纱布公司直接委托合作社收购良种的方式要好的多。
    四、加工与保纯
    加工是保持棉种纯度的重要关键之一，我们把接收伪棉产改进处的五个动力轧花厂，一个人力轧花厂，加以充实与改组，并新建了五个动力轧花厂，一个人力轧花厂，专司良种加工。轧花厂是企业性质的，实行成本核算。这样执行的结果，据目前情况来看，轧花厂不仅可以保本而且还能取得一点利润（当然很小）。这就保证了轧花厂可以逐年扩大基金，掌握更多的良种。几年之后，不依靠农贷也能完成良种加工的任务，实质上发挥着种子公司的作用。但它又决不同于商人的单纯利润观点的经营，而主要是普遍的进行籽棉挑选，检出可以识别的杂棉絮，及因病虫为害的僵瓣，轧出种子后，又经过两次筛检，把混进去的杂劣退化的小黑子、小绿子等筛出。经过这样加工也大大的提高了种子纯度与原棉质量。根据我们的体会，专为繁种的良种管理区内的棉花，一定要在各级棉产改进机构直接领导或监督下的轧花厂集中加工（这种轧花厂不仅要有技术指导，更需要有经济（必要时不惜亏本）、政治的保证），或者委托坚强的有保证的接受技术指导的合作社来办。棉产改进处的轧花厂只能轧基本良种繁殖区一至二万亩棉田内所产的棉花。随着推广区的扩大，就需要加强合作社的力量，来组织更多的小型轧花厂，完成掌握良种，扩大推广的任务。其次是加强对私人轧花厂的组织与管理，目前对这方面的经验还很少，只能当问题提出来研究。
