　　Important Correction
    In the first article, second paragraph, of the Beijing Weaving and Dyeing Industry Labor-Capital Collective Contract published in this newspaper on November 30th, "…employees such as those attending meetings and on official business…" the word "other" was omitted before "official business."
    Also: The original "Factory Regulations" of seven articles attached to the contract were not published earlier, so they are now added below:
    Attached Weaving and Dyeing Industry Factory Regulations
    ⒈ Employees must not be late or leave early during working hours, or leave their posts without permission. They must also follow the instructions of the person in charge regarding their work.
    ⒉ If an employee is unable to continue working during working hours due to illness or other reasons, they must ask the management for leave.
    ⒊ All factory equipment and raw materials must be cherished and not wasted or damaged arbitrarily.
    ⒋ Employees must declare to the factory if they are carrying anything out of the factory.
    ⒌ Drinking, gambling, drug use, fighting, and smoking in the machine room are strictly prohibited in the factory.
    ⒍ Pay attention to maintaining public hygiene.
    ⒎ If an employee's relatives or friends are staying in the factory, they must obtain prior permission from the factory.
