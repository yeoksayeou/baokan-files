Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th—Over 140 delegates and guests from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, North Korea, India, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Burma, Indonesia, Malaya, etc., who attended the Asian Women's Representative Conference, as well as guests from the Czech Republic, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Cuba, West Africa, Madagascar, etc., and the North Korean Cultural Troupe, have returned home via Tianjin on the 26th after completing their visit to Shanghai from Beijing. Mrs. Guzik, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, a portion of the Soviet delegation, French guest Vermersch, Czech guests, and others, totaling twelve people, left Beijing on the 27th to return home. After the closing of the Asian Women's Representative Conference, the delegates and guests organized a visiting group and, together with the North Korean Cultural Troupe, departed from Beijing on the 18th of this month for a visit to Shanghai. The visiting group arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd and, after disembarking, immediately participated in a torchlight welcome rally of over a thousand people in the station square. On the morning of the same day, they separately attended four grand welcome meetings of female workers, female cultural and educational workers, female students, childcare workers, and housewives in Shanghai. On the 22nd and 23rd, they attended two banquet evenings hosted by Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government and Honorary Chairman of the National Democratic Women's Federation, and the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The majority of the delegation's time in Shanghai was spent visiting factories, schools, and nurseries in Shanghai. During the visits, they listened carefully to and observed the Shanghai workers' and students' pre-liberation struggle experiences and the post-liberation lives, work, and the development of childcare. The delegates expressed that they would convey these experiences to the people of various countries who are currently struggling. The visiting group successively visited seven factories, including China Textile Construction Company (referred to as Zhongfang) Factory No. 1, Zhongfang Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 1, and Shenxin Factory No. 9, five universities and middle schools, including Jiaotong University, and seven children's welfare institutions, including the East China Nursery. They received enthusiastic welcomes wherever they went, and the female workers gave their most treasured items to the delegates as souvenirs. The delegates expressed their extreme gratitude for the reception from the workers, etc. Mrs. Guzik, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, pinned the emblem of the Women's International Democratic Federation on the production champion banner in the workshop; French women's leader Vermersch gave a golden commemorative medal of the French Women's Union to a female worker model. When visiting Shenxin Factory No. 9, the delegates paid particular attention to the deeds of the "February 2nd" struggle of Shenxin Factory No. 9 (Note: On February 2, 1948, workers of Shenxin Factory No. 9 held a strike to demand improved treatment, which was met with a bloody massacre by the Kuomintang bandits; male and female workers of the factory rose up in self-defense). Bafinova said: "I hope the workers of Shenxin Factory No. 9 will inherit the glorious tradition and strive to build a new China." At the tea party at Jiaotong University, British guest Lamerson excitedly assured the students that she would definitely cooperate with progressive forces to jointly oppose the war mongers after returning home. During their stay in Shanghai, the North Korean Cultural Troupe performed three wonderful programs, leaving a deep impression on the people of Shanghai. In the afternoon of the 24th, the visiting group toured the city and left Shanghai by train that evening. Military and political leaders of Shanghai and representatives from all walks of life went to the station to see them off. The visiting group received grand welcomes from representatives from all walks of life in Tianjin, Jinan, and Nanjing when they passed through on their way to Shanghai.
