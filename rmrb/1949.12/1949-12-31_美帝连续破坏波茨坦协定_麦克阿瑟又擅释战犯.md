　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th: According to reports from Universal News Service and Agence France-Presse, the US Commander of the occupying forces in Japan, MacArthur, arbitrarily announced on the morning of the 25th (Christmas Day) that he was pardoning 46 Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced to imprisonment and detained in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo, on the pretext that they had "behaved well in prison." MacArthur also announced that he was considering a release system "that would apply to all prisoners serving sentences, including life imprisonment." This announcement is tantamount to forewarning that MacArthur will continue to release war criminals in large numbers in the future. MacArthur's action once again violated the common agreement in the Potsdam Proclamation regarding "severe punishment of war criminals."
　　It is noted that MacArthur, based on the policy of supporting the revival of Japanese militarism, had twice released more than 20 important Japanese war criminals, on August 31, 1946, and August 30, 1947. On December 24, 1948, he released 19 Class A Japanese war criminals. In January 1949, MacArthur colluded with bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek to illegally return Okamura Yasuji, a major Japanese war criminal who invaded China, and 260 other war criminals to Japan.

　　美帝连续破坏波茨坦协定
  　麦克阿瑟又擅释战犯
    【新华社北京三十日电】据全众社与法新社报道，美国驻日本占领军统帅麦克阿瑟，于二十五日（圣诞节）晨擅目宣布特赦已被判处徒刑而被拘于东京巢鸭监狱中的日本战争罪犯四十六名，借口是他们“在监狱内表现良好”。麦克阿瑟并宣布，他正在考虑一种释放制度，“这个制度将适用于正受刑期的一切犯人，包括无期徒刑在内”。这一宣布，等于预告今后麦克阿瑟将继续大批释放战犯。麦克阿瑟这一行动，又一次破坏了波茨坦公告中关于“严厉制裁战犯”的共同协定。
    按，麦克阿瑟根据扶植日本军国主义复活的政策，曾在一九四六年八月三十一日与一九四七年八月三十日，两次释放日本重要战犯二十余名。一九四八年十二月二十四日，他又释放日本甲级战犯十九名。一九四九年一月间，麦克阿瑟勾结匪首蒋介石，将日本侵华主要战犯冈村宁次及其他战犯二百六十名，非法接回日本。
