　　Guaranteeing Worker Safety
  　Joint Trade Union of Small Mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau
  　Inspects Safety Equipment in Mentougou Small Mines
    Over Twenty Mines Suspended for Repairs Due to Dangerous Conditions
    [Beijing News] The joint trade union of small mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau, the preparatory committee of the Mentougou Coal Mining Industry Union, and Guan Zuotou (experienced miners employed by the Mine Union) have been conducting safety inspections of small mines in the Mentougou district from November 12th to December 5th to strengthen mining safety and protect worker safety. In twenty-three days, a total of 116 small mines were inspected. Among them, six mines were ordered to stop mining and carry out repairs due to dangerous conditions; seven mines were ordered to suspend two shifts (normally three shifts are used for mining) to repair the engineering; and seven mines were ordered to suspend one shift. The majority of the rest were ordered to repair the engineering while continuing to mine. In addition, three small mines voluntarily suspended operations for repairs after hearing about the safety inspections.

    The inspection team will continue to conduct follow-up inspections and spot checks. This is a major event for Mentougou, and it can only be achieved under the leadership of the people's own government and the workers' own trade union.

    For many years, deaths and drownings in coal mines were considered "common occurrences." Even the workers felt, "Surrounded by stone on all sides, how can there not be casualties?" Accidents were blamed on fate. The reactionary governments of the past never intervened. Mine owners and managers only cared about making money and dealt with engineering issues in the easiest way possible. After liberation, while mine owners and managers stopped beating and scolding workers, they did not improve the engineering. The mining bureau and the trade union also did not conduct systematic inspections. In September and October, successive tragedies occurred at Minsheng Hongji and Damao Sheng (the former killed twelve people, and the latter killed five, both due to roof collapses after mining coal pillars), which attracted a high degree of attention from all parties. The Jingxi Mining Bureau, the trade union, the district government, and the district committee of the Chinese Communist Party jointly formed a worker safety committee. Each mine formed a worker safety team composed of managers, Dazuo Tou (head miners), and worker representatives. The mining bureau registered and verified the Zuotou (mining team leaders) of each mine, drafted engineering rules, and convened a meeting of all Zuotou to explain the importance of worker safety. The trade union opened vocational spare-time schools to educate workers on labor protection issues, engineering rules, and labor discipline, in conjunction with general political and cultural studies.

    Before conducting a general inspection of the safety equipment of various small mines, the Jingxi Mining Bureau divided the 433 Zuotou in the Mencheng district into fifteen groups and selected those with good skills as the group leaders and deputy group leaders. From November 1st to the 10th, the group leaders inspected the engineering of the small mines in their groups. During this stage, the group leaders were generally very responsible and discovered and identified many problems.

    From November to December 1st, general inspections began. The old mines and the more dangerous mines were inspected first. The mine roadways, coal outlets, and how the engineering should be repaired were all drawn in diagrams and filled in on forms. Among the 116 mines inspected, the vast majority needed engineering repairs. The relatively good ones were Xinshun, Tianyi, Tongxing, and other mines, where the mine pillars were thick enough and the engineering was done according to the rules. The worst engineering was found in six mines. The Qishun mine's pillars were thin and sparse, and they were all bent. In one place, the roof had cracks of more than one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters); most of the pillars in the Xibin Xin mine were rotten, and some had even collapsed. The roof stones and the second nature stones (夹石) (interlayer stone between coal seam and roof stone) in the roadways were all cracked; the Tianzeng mine had been open for seventy or eighty years and had never replaced its pillars. The Jingxi Mining Bureau has ordered these most dangerous mines to immediately suspend work for repairs. After the repairs are completed and approved by the inspection, work can resume.

    During the inspection process, some mines rushed to repair the engineering before being inspected. Some mines even took the initiative to go to the Mine Union and ask them to conduct inspections and provide guidance as soon as possible to avoid danger. However, some mines attempted to conceal and cope with the situation. For example, when the inspection team inspected the Fuxing mine, they blocked the dangerous areas and did not allow them to be seen. The inspection team told them to drain the water pond, but after the inspection team left, they not only did not do it, but instead dug coal in the dangerous area. As a result, on December 2nd, one person was injured. The roadway of the Guangpu mine had more than a dozen cracks, more than twenty zhang (approximately 66 meters) long. The inspection team told it to repair, but it submitted a report, saying that it was guaranteed that nothing would happen. The Jingxi Mining Bureau and the trade union criticized and warned these mines that disregarded worker safety.

    After this inspection, the workers were very satisfied. They said: The people's government takes care of us very thoughtfully. Who would care if we died under the Kuomintang! The engineering of various mines has also been greatly improved, which can greatly reduce worker casualties; and it has increased the attention of both workers and mine owners to safety issues in their thinking. However, because the significance of the inspection was not adequately explained to the workers in advance, some workers did not pay attention to the safety inspection. At the same time, because there were few staff members and a lack of inspection experience, the inspection was relatively negligent of the surrounding situation. For example, the Junmin mine, after inspection, was considered to have no problems in itself, only a lot of empty ponds. The next day, water suddenly came in and drowned a worker. Therefore, the inspection work must be more extensive and in-depth, all-encompassing, and cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

　　保障工人安全
  　京西矿务处各小窑联合工会
  　检查门头沟小窑安全设备
    二十余家因工程危险停工修理
    【北京讯】京西矿务处联合各小窑工会、门城煤矿业联合会筹备会及官作头（即矿联会所聘用对开窑有技术有经验之人）等，从十一月十二日起，到十二月五日止，举行门城区小窑安全检查，以加强采矿安全工作，保障工人安全。在二十三天里，共检查了小窑一百一十六家。其中，因工程危险，被停止采煤、进行修理者六家；被停两班（平常分三班采煤）以修理工程者七家；被停一班者七家。其余大部分都被令一面修理工程，一面采煤。此外，还有三家小窑，因听见要检查安全，自动停工修理。
    今后检查组将继续进行复查和抽查。这是门头沟的一件大事，只有在人民自己的政府和工人自己的工会领导下，才能够作到。
    多少年来，煤窑里砸死人、淹死人，被认为是“常事”，连工人都觉得“四面石头夹着人，还短得了伤亡？”出了事怨命。过去的反动政府也从来没有过问。窑主、经理，更是只知赚钱，对工程方面，能对付就对付。解放后，窑主、经理等对工人虽然不打不骂了，可是对工程并没有改善。矿务处和工会也没有有系统的检查。到九、十两月，民生宏记和大茂盛连续发生惨案（前者死十二人，后者死五人，都因为挖采煤柱落顶），才引起各方面的高度注意。京西矿务处、工会、区政府和中共区委会联合组成了工人安全委员会，各窑由经理、大作头、工人代表组织工人安全小组。矿务处登记并审核各窑作头，拟定工程规则，召开全体作头会议，讲解工人安全的重要性。工会开办职工业余学校，以劳保问题、工程规则、劳动纪律配合一般政治文化学习，进行教育。
    在普遍检查各小窑安全设备以前，京西矿务处就把门城区的四百三十三个作头，编成十五组，选技术好的作正副组长。自十一月一日起，到十日止，由各组长检查本组各小窑的工程。在这一阶段中，组长们一般的都很负责，发现与检查出不少问题。
    从十一月到十二日起，开始普遍检查。先检查老窑和比较危险的窑。把窑道和出煤的地方以及应如何修理工程，都画好图，填好表。在检查的一百一十六家中，绝大多数都需要修理工程，其中比较好的是新顺、天益、同兴等窑，窑柱都够粗，工程做的也规矩。工程最坏的有六家，启顺窑的窑柱又细又稀，都折了腰，有个地方顶板裂缝一丈多；西宾鑫窑大部窑柱朽烂，有的都倒了，窑道的顶石和八处二性石（煤层与顶石间之夹石）都裂了缝；天增窑已开了七、八十年，从来没换过窑柱。对于这些最危险的窑，京西矿务处已令马上停工修理，修好后，经检查批准后再开工。
    在检查过程中，有些窑，在没检查到它时，就赶紧修工程。有些窑还主动的跑到矿联会，请赶快去检查、指导，免得出危险。但是有些窑，还企图蒙蔽应付。如检查组检查复兴窑时，竟把危险地方堵住没叫看，检查组叫综把水塘叉死，等检查组走后，不但不做，反而往危险处挖煤。结果十二月二日，就砸伤了一人。广普窑窑道裂了十几段，有二十多丈长，检查组叫它修理，它反上了个呈文，说是保险不出事。对于这些不顾工人安全的窑，京西矿务处和工会都予以批评和警告。
    经过这次检查后，工人们都很满意，他们说：人民政府照顾的真周到，在国民党时，死了有谁管呵！各窑的工程也有极大的改进，可大大减少工人伤亡；而且使工人和窑方，在思想上对安全问题都提高了注意。但是，因为事先对工人解释检查的意义还作得不够，所以还有部分工人，对安全检查，未予重视。同时，因为工作人员少，又缺乏检查经验，所以检查时对它周围的情况比较忽略。例如军民窑，经过检查后，认为本身没有什么问题，只是空塘多。到第二天，就突然来了水，淹死一个工人。因此检查工作还得更广泛深入，面面俱到，不能有一毫放松。
