Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: The following is a summary of the speech "On the Struggle of Vietnamese Women for Peace, Democracy, and National Independence" delivered by Vietnamese representative Ho Duc Minh at the Asian Women's Representatives Conference this morning.

　　The Asian Women's Representatives Conference is being held at a time when Vietnam's struggle has reached a decisive stage of final victory. This conference is a tremendous support and strength for the struggle of Vietnamese women to defend and consolidate the democratic republic.

　　In the past, under French colonial policy, the Vietnamese people had no country or flag. They were called "Annamese," meaning conquered Vietnamese. The French colonialists exploited the "native" people to the last drop of blood, depriving them of all democratic rights, and suppressing even the smallest popular movements with the greatest force. Under such harsh conditions, the Vietnamese people never ceased their struggle for liberation for eighty years. Women actively participated in every period. They united under the "Women's Anti-Imperialist Federation" and established many branches in villages and factories.

　　During World War II, the Vichy government handed Vietnam over to Japan. Thus, the "Viet Minh Front" was established. It mobilized the people to fight against Japan. At that time, the main women's organization, the "Women's Association," united women of all faiths and professions and also participated in the "Viet Minh Front."

　　In August 1945, due to the Soviet victory over Hitler's Germany, Japan surrendered. The "Viet Minh Front" then led the people to seize power. But at this very moment, the French imperialists attempted to reconquer Vietnam. Therefore, President Ho Chi Minh called on the Vietnamese people to unite and resist the aggressors. Vietnamese women also launched a struggle to defend the republic and to defend peace and democracy.

　　Vietnamese women united to form a unified front, the "Vietnam Women's Union," with two million members. It unites all Vietnamese women's organizations and has branches everywhere. It publishes its own publications, "Voice of Women" and "Women for the Defense of National Welfare." On the front lines, Vietnamese women participated in shock and guerrilla squads, the most famous of which were the "Ming Kai" team, the "Loyal" team, the "Mei Ling" team, and the "Peace" team. Women were responsible for intelligence, liaison, propaganda, armed struggle, and transportation. They went deep behind enemy lines to distribute leaflets to awaken the people. Thanks to their work, Vietnamese soldiers in the French army returned to our ranks. During sabotage operations, three thousand women in Xing'an destroyed thirty sections of roads. In Bac Ninh, 1,260 women, including 100 old women and 200 girls, cut 1,800 meters of Highway 16 and 800 meters of Highway 1.

　　The war in Vietnam is a war that will never succeed for the colonialists, and it has also aroused unanimous protests from the French people. Vietnamese women and the Vietnamese people have only one demand: independence! Only one hope: democracy! Only one government: the resistance government led by Ho Chi Minh! Vietnamese women stand with their democratic sisters around the world, under the banner of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and resolutely fight until final victory.

　　We thank the International Democratic Women's Federation for instructing us to treat our problems as international issues. In particular, it was able to introduce the lives and struggles of Asian women to the women of the world. Finally, to the sisters of the French Women's Union, we extend our sincere friendship. Your votes in favor of peace in Vietnam and your many demonstrations against the unjust war in Vietnam will forever unite us in the struggle against imperialism and for the defense of democracy and peace.

　　越南代表胡德明讲话摘要
    【新华社北京十二日电】今日上午亚洲妇女代表会议上，越南代表胡德明作了“关于为和平民主与民族独立的越南妇女的斗争”的发言。摘要如下：
    亚洲妇女代表会议开会的时候，正是越南的斗争达到最后胜利的决定性阶段的时候。这个会议对于越南妇女保卫和巩固民主共和国的斗争是一种最大的支持和力量。
    过去，在法国殖民政策之下的越南，人民没有国号，也没有国旗，人家叫他们作“安南人”，意思就是被征服了的越南人。法国殖民者剥削“土著”人民到最后一滴血；把他们一切民主权利剥夺净尽；他们对最小的民众运动，都施用最大的弹压。在这样恶劣情况下，八十年来越南人民都没有停止过解放斗争。在各个时期中妇女也都积极参加。她们在“妇女反帝联合会”下团结起来，并在乡村、和工厂都建立了许多分会。
    在二次世界大战时期，维琪政府把越南交给了日本。于是，“越盟阵线”建立起来了。它动员了民众来对日本斗争。那时主要的妇女团体“妇女协会”，团结了越南各种信仰、各种职业的妇女也参加了“越盟阵线”。
    一九四五年八月，由于苏联对希特勒德国的胜利，日本投降了。“越盟阵线”于是领导人民获得政权。但是也就在这时，法国帝国主义者企图重新征服越南，于是胡志明主席号召越南人民一致抗战，抵抗侵略者。越南妇女为保卫共和国，为保卫和平与民主也展开了斗争。
    越南妇女团结起来组成了统一阵线，这就是有两百万会员的“越南妇女联合会”。它团结了所有越南的妇女团体，到处都有她的分会。她出版了自己的刊物“妇女之声”和“保卫民族福利之妇女”；在前线上，越南妇女们参加了突击和游击小队，最著名的就是“明开”队、“忠实”队、”“梅领”队以及“和平”队。妇女们分别担任了情报、联络、宣传、武装斗争以及运输的工作，她们深入敌军后方，散发唤起民众的传单。由于她们的工作，在法军中的越南士兵回到了我们的队伍里。在进行破坏工作时，兴安三千名妇女破坏了三十段公路。在北宁一千二百六十个妇女，其中有一百个老太太和二百个女孩子曾经切断了长达一千八百公尺的第十六号公路和第一号长达八百公尺的公路。
    越南的战争对于殖民者来说是一个绝不会成功的战争，同时这个战争并引起法国人民一致的抗议。越南妇女与越南人民只有一个要求，那就是独立！只有一个希望，那就是民主！只有一个政府，那就是胡志明领导的抗战政府！越南妇女站在世界民主姊妹们一起，在国际民主妇联旗帜下，坚决斗争直到最后胜利。
    我们感谢国际民主妇联，她指示我们，把我们的问题作为国际问题之一。特别她能在世界妇女之前，介绍了亚洲妇女的生活和斗争的情况。最后，对于法国妇女联合会的姊妹们，我们要向你们表示真诚的友谊。你们赞成越南和平的投票；你们反对向越南进行非正义战争的许多次示威运动，使我们永远在反帝国主义保卫民主与和平的斗争中联合在一起。
