[Beijing News] In celebration of Marshal Stalin's seventieth birthday, the suburban branches of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held celebration meetings on the 20th and 21st. Villages that have established branches or sub-branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held separate evening parties or forums. In addition to participating in the celebration meetings, farmers in various villages sent many birthday gifts, such as couplets, the character "寿" (longevity), congratulatory banners, tea, congratulatory letters, and congratulatory messages, to the branches, requesting the branches to present them to Marshal Stalin.

[Our Newspaper] Residents of various districts in Beijing warmly celebrate Marshal Stalin's birthday. More than 11,000 people in the tenth and eleventh districts have signed their names to offer birthday congratulations. The Tenth District held birthday lecture meetings for three consecutive days, with cadres from the district explaining the significance of celebrating the birthday, introducing Stalin's great career and his help to the Chinese revolution. The audience reached more than 7,000 people. In addition to all the cadres of the district sending a pair of Beijing's special handicraft jade birds as a birthday gift, workers from various factories sent gifts: workers from the Li'an Iron Factory sent Marshal Stalin a pair of haircutting "clippers," workers from the Yongtaihe Iron Factory sent a steel file made by themselves, and workers from the Zhixing Industrial Cooperative sent a pair of glass cups as a birthday gift. Yang Yisan, a Hui resident of the Eleventh District, after hearing about Stalin's great help to the Chinese revolution, said: "Today I know Stalin's help in our liberation, and we Hui people should be even more grateful to him." Other residents asked to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as members. Workers from factories such as Dahua in the district held continuous birthday parades for two or three days.
