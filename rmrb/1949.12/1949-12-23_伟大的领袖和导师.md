Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22nd: TASS, Moscow, December 20th: The Pravda editorial, entitled "Great Leader and Teacher," reads as follows:

　　The heroic Soviet people, the working people of all countries, and all progressive humanity warmly celebrate the 70th birthday of Stalin—the genius leader and teacher, the greatest man of our time. The Soviet people, who are at the forefront of all mankind under Stalin's wise leadership, pay tribute to their leader and teacher with infinite enthusiasm and gratitude. The working men and women of the people's democratic countries, who have embarked on the road of building socialism, most sincerely pay tribute to Comrade Stalin. The great Chinese people extend warm greetings to the leader of the working people of the world. The working people and the people of the colonies in capitalist countries, all those who are exploited and oppressed, extend sincere and warm congratulations to Comrade Stalin. For them, the name of the great Stalin is the banner of the liberation struggle, the hope for a happy and bright future.

　　Stalin's entire life and activities are a compelling example of selfless service to the people and the cause of communism. Comrade Stalin once said: "If in my work of awakening the working class and consolidating the socialist state of the working class, every step is not used to strengthen and improve the position of the working class, then I would consider my life to be meaningless."

　　From the very first steps in the struggle for the liberation of the working people, Stalin had unlimited trust in Lenin's revolutionary genius, considering him the leader and teacher of the militant Marxist revolutionary party, the highest type of leader, an eagle who fearlessly and courageously led the party along the unexplored road of the Russian revolutionary movement in the struggle. Comrade Stalin became a faithful student, close comrade-in-arms, and friend of the great Lenin. A great and moving friendship developed between Lenin and Stalin. This close, loving cooperation between the two revolutionary geniuses had great importance in the life of our party. Comrade Stalin and Lenin together established and consolidated the powerful Bolshevik Party. Comrade Stalin and Lenin together led the Party and the working class to the victorious armed uprising of October 1917. Comrade Stalin and Lenin together laid the unshakable foundation for the Soviet state, and together guided the Party and the people in the struggle against the internal and external enemies of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Lenin and Stalin together drafted the plan for the socialist construction of our motherland.

　　Comrade Stalin, a new type of revolutionary leader, combined theoretical strength with the practical and organizational experience of the proletarian revolutionary movement. Comrade Stalin and Lenin jointly developed the ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical principles of Bolshevism, and became Lenin's main supporter and closest comrade-in-arms in building and strengthening the Bolshevik Party and guiding its entire activities. Having suffered unprecedented poverty, hardship, and Tsarist persecution, Comrade Stalin, as a professional revolutionary, carried out enormous work, uniting, theoretically arming, and politically training the Party in the class struggle. In the stormy days of preparing and carrying out the Great October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Stalin showed himself to be Lenin's most loyal companion in organizing the revolutionary offensive and the greatest master of revolutionary strategy and tactics.

　　The Great October Socialist Revolution has opened a new era in human history—the era of the proletarian revolution. Lenin and Stalin—the inspirers and organizers of the revolutionary victory (a victory of world-historical significance)—held the helm of the world's first socialist country. Comrade Stalin became a member of the Soviet government headed by Lenin, and together with Lenin led the Bolshevik Party, which had become the ruling party and guiding and leading force of the Soviet state. Comrade Stalin led the entire activities of the Party and the Soviet government in solving the national question in the Soviet Union. The establishment of various Soviet national republics and their union into the Soviet Union is linked with the name of Stalin. Comrade Stalin is the creator of the friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union.

　　During the years of the patriotic civil war, Comrade Stalin, as Lenin's representative on the Defense Committee, became the inspirer and organizer of the victories won by the Red Army on all fronts where the success or failure of the revolution depended.

　　Comrade Stalin and Lenin built the young Soviet state, strengthened the Party, and ruthlessly defeated the enemies of Leninism. Comrade Stalin, through all his activities, won the infinite trust and ardent love of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people. After the death of his great teacher, Lenin, Comrade Stalin, Lenin's faithful comrade-in-arms and confidant, has always held high Lenin's invincible banner, bravely and confidently leading the Party and the Soviet people forward along Lenin's road—towards the victory of socialism. At the Second Congress of Soviets, Comrade Stalin, on behalf of the Bolshevik Party, swore to be loyal to Lenin's instructions. Now, everyone can see that Comrade Stalin's oath has been gloriously fulfilled, and under Stalin's leadership, Lenin's cause is alive and victorious. The Soviet people look back with due pride on the glorious path our country has traversed under the guidance of Comrade Stalin. In a period of time that is short in historical terms, our country has leaped from backwardness to progress and has become a strong socialist country. According to Comrade Stalin's genius plan, our country has realized industrialization, which has ensured the technical reconstruction of the entire national economy and ensured the consolidation of our national defense. Comrade Stalin is the inspirer and organizer of those revolutionary innovations—complete collectivization and the complete elimination of the rich peasants as a class—which have far-reaching influence. Comrade Stalin, the creator of the collective farming system, has led our millions of farmers onto the broad road of building a socialist life.

　　Even in the early days of revolutionary activities, Comrade Stalin once wrote: Great abilities are produced for great purposes. Stalin has awakened and inspired the abilities of millions of working people in the grand Five-Year Plans. Comrade Stalin is the inspirer and organizer of the national socialist competition, which has turned labor into a matter of honor, a matter of glory, a matter of fortitude and heroism. Comrade Stalin encourages the creativity of the working people with fatherly care, encouraging every new patriotic act of the workers and peasants in the cities and countryside. The reformers of production methods (the Stakhanovite movement of men and women in industry and agriculture) say: "We were brought up by Stalin." Many cadres educated by our Party say the same thing. The entire Soviet people, expressing gratitude to their beloved leader and teacher, also say the same thing.

　　In the struggle to win the victory of socialism, the Bolshevik Party has been further tempered and has become a stronger leading force and guiding force of Soviet society, its prestige has been increasing day by day, and its connection with the broadest masses of working people has been strengthened day by day. Thanks to Comrade Stalin's extraordinary foresight and his uncompromising nature, the Party has exposed and defeated the Trotsky-Bukharin elements and other traitors—the irreconcilable enemies of Leninism.

　　Stalin's wise leadership has ensured the victory of socialism in our country. This victory has been embodied in law by the Soviet Constitution, which is affectionately called the Stalin Constitution by our people in memory of its great creator. The Stalin Constitution has become the banner and fighting program of action for the working people of the world.

　　Jiang Bul, the centenarian poet of Kazakhstan, once called Stalin "the teacher of the world." He wrote poems for this great leader, and his poems are filled with infinite love. He said: If Stalin is with us, the truth is with us; if Stalin is with us, we are strong; if Stalin is with us, the flag of a happy, powerful, and sun-drenched country will fly proudly in the wind!

　　Comrade Stalin, leading the Party forward along the road of socialist victory, has raised the doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin to the highest level. Comrade Stalin, the leader of Marxist-Leninist science, creatively develops all the basic doctrines of Marxist-Leninist theory, scientifically summarizes the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and summarizes the experience of the international revolutionary movement. Stalin's thought, which is deeply rooted in the broadest masses of working people, has become a powerful material force, accelerating the process of historical development. Under Comrade Stalin's leadership, the unparalleled heroic deeds achieved by the Soviet people during the Great Patriotic War will forever live in the memory of the people of all countries. Marshal Stalin, the creator of progressive Soviet military science, drafted and executed a brilliant strategic plan to defeat the enemy, making the course of the Great War obey his will, and enabling the peoples of the Soviet Union to win a victory of world importance in the greatest war. After the victorious end of the Great Patriotic War, the peoples of the Soviet Union, under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, began large-scale peaceful creative work. Comrade Stalin, in his epoch-making speech at the electoral assembly on February 9, 1946, outlined the brilliant plan for our country's construction of communism. The entire Soviet people have enthusiastically set about fulfilling Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan. Our industry has begun to develop rapidly; socialist agriculture is also advancing by leaps and bounds. On the basis of our country's strong economic upsurge, the material welfare of the working people is constantly increasing. Progressive science is developing rapidly, and socialist culture is flourishing. The decisions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), based on Comrade Stalin's proposal, on literature and art have raised all ideological work to a higher level.

　　Fulfilling Stalin's genius draft, our glorious Communist Party—the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of communism—is developing and strengthening day by day. The Bolshevik Party is earnestly promoting the progress and development of all new things and resolutely carrying out the struggle against stagnation and inertia. Comrade Stalin's instructions on developing Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are guiding all the work of our Party.

　　The great Stalin is the leader and teacher of the international working class. Comrade Stalin's writings have enabled the Communist and Workers' Parties to understand the laws of socialist development and the laws of class struggle, to master the strategy and tactics of the revolutionary movement, and they teach these parties in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, revolutionary consciousness, and intolerance of the enemies of socialism.

　　The working people of all countries extend their congratulations to Comrade Stalin, the great standard-bearer of peace. The call issued by Comrade Stalin to fight against the instigators of a new imperialist war has been widely echoed in all countries. For the first time in history, a powerful peace front uniting hundreds of millions of peace fighters has been formed. Comrade Stalin's name is the most cherished name for workers all over the world. Under Comrade Stalin's leadership, the victory of socialism in our country has ignited the hope of liberation in the hearts of workers and peasants all over the world. Currently, millions of people are living and fighting under the banner of socialism. The working people of the whole world love Stalin's dedication to their interests, love his firmness, calmness, energy, and determination, love his revolutionary foresight and wisdom. We live in the era of the great Stalin. When we realize that we are led and guided by the great and beloved Stalin, and realize that he is pointing out the road to a bright future for us, this gives us—the participants in communist construction—great joy. Stalin's name symbolizes the greatness of the victorious Soviet Union, it calls on the people of the world to fight for a better future, for the happiness of mankind! In every corner of the world, in various languages and dialects, today, from the bottom of people's hearts, such words are issued: For the happiness of the working people of the world, wish Stalin—the great leader, teacher, and friend—health and longevity! Under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, march towards communism!

　　伟大的领袖和导师
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：真理报社论，题“伟大的领袖和导师”，文如下：
    英勇的苏联人民、各国劳动人民及全体进步人类，都热情地庆祝斯大林——天才的领袖和导师、我们当代最伟大的人的七十大寿。在斯大林的智慧领导之下走在全人类前列的苏联人民，以无限的热情和感激，向他们的领袖与导师致敬。走上建设社会主义道路的人民民主国家的劳动男女，最恳挚地向斯大林同志致敬。伟大的中国人民，向全世界劳动人民的领袖致以热烈的敬礼。资本主义国家的劳动人民和殖民地的人民，一切被剥削和被压迫者，都向斯大林同志致真诚而热烈的祝贺。对于他们，伟大的斯大林的名字，就是解放斗争的旗帜，就是幸福而光明的未来的希望。
    斯大林的全部生活和活动，就是无我地为人民、为共产主义事业服务的有感召力的榜样。斯大林同志有一次曾经说过：“如果在我唤醒工人阶级和巩固工人阶级的社会主义国家的工作里，不是每一步都用于加强和改善工人阶级的地位，那么，我就会认为我的生活是无目的的。”
    从为劳动人民的解放而斗争的最初几步开始，斯大林就对列宁的革命天才抱有无限的信任，认为他是战斗的马克思主义革命政党的领袖和导师，是最高典型的领袖，是在斗争中无所畏惧而勇敢地领导党沿着俄国革命运动的没有开拓过的道路前进的山鹰。斯大林同志成为伟大的列宁的忠实的学生、亲密的战友和朋友。在列宁和斯大林之间发展着伟大的和感人的友谊。两个革命天才的这种密切的友爱合作，在我党的生活上有着很大重要性。斯大林同志与列宁一同建立和巩固了强大的布尔什维克党。斯大林同志与列宁一同领导党和工人阶级走向一九一七年十月胜利的武装起义。斯大林同志与列宁一同为苏维埃国家奠下不可动摇的基础，一同指导党和人民对伟大的十月社会主义革命的内外敌人斗争。列宁和斯大林一同草拟了我们祖国的社会主义建设的计划。
    新型的革命领袖斯大林同志，集理论的力量与无产阶级革命运动的实际与组织经验于一身。斯大林同志与列宁共同发展了布尔什维主义的思想上、组织上、策略上和理论上的原则，并成为列宁在建设与加强布尔什维克党及指导其全部活动中的主要支持者和最亲密的战友。遭受过空前的穷困，艰辛和沙皇的迫害的作为职业革命家的斯大林同志，进行了巨大的工作，在阶级斗争中团结、在理论上武装和在政治上锻炼党。在准备及进行伟大的十月社会主义革命的暴风雨般的日子中，斯大林同志表现是列宁在组织革命进攻中的最忠诚的同伴和精通革命战略和策略的最伟大的大匠。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命已揭开了人类历史的新纪元——无产阶级革命的纪元。列宁和斯大林——革命胜利（这是有着世界历史重要性的胜利）的鼓舞者与组织者，撑住世界上第一个社会主义国家的舵。斯大林同志成为以列宁为首的苏维埃政府中的一员，并且和列宁一起领导那已成为苏维埃国家执政党和指导与领导力量的布尔什维克党。在苏联民族问题的解决方面，斯大林同志领导了党和苏维埃政权的全部活动。各苏维埃民族共和国的建立，以及它们的结合成为苏联，是与斯大林的名字连结着的。斯大林同志是苏联各民族人民的友谊的缔造者。
    在爱国内战的岁月里，作为国防委员会中列宁之代表的斯大林同志，成为红军在革命成败所系的各战线上所赢得的胜利的鼓舞者与组织者。
    斯大林同志和列宁一道建设年青的苏维埃国家，使党壮大，并无情地击败了列宁主义的敌人。斯大林同志因他的全部活动而赢得布尔什维克党及苏联人民的无限信任与火炽的热爱。列宁忠实的战友和知己斯大林同志在他的伟大导师逝世之后，一直高擎着列宁那不可被战胜的旗帜，勇敢而满怀信心地领导党和苏联人民沿着列宁的道路前进——向社会主义的胜利前进。在苏维埃第二届代表大会上，斯大林同志曾代表布尔什维克党发誓忠于列宁的训谕。现在，谁都看得见：斯大林同志的誓言是光荣完成了，而且，在斯大林领导之下，列宁的事业是在生存和胜利。苏联人民带着应有的非常骄傲来回顾我国在斯大林同志指引之下所走过的光荣道路。在从历史说来是短短的一段时间里，我国已从落后飞跃到进步，并已成为强有力的社会主义国家。按照斯大林同志天才的计划，我国已实现了工业化，这就保证了全部国民经济的技术重建，并保证了我国国防的巩固。斯大林同志是那些有着革命意义的、影响极其远大的革新——完全集体化，并把富农作为一个阶级加以完全消灭——的鼓舞者与组织者。集体耕作制度的创造者斯大林同志，已把我们千百万农民带上建设社会主义生活的康庄大道。
    甚至在从事革命活动的早期，斯大林同志就曾经写过：伟大的能力是为伟大的目的而产生的。斯大林已在宏大的几次五年计划中唤醒了并激励了千百万劳动人民的能力。斯大林同志是全国性社会主义竞赛的鼓舞者与组织者，这种社会主义竞赛，已把劳动变为荣誉的事，变为光荣的事，变为刚毅与英雄主义的事。斯大林同志以父亲般的关怀来鼓励劳动人民的创造性，来鼓励城乡劳动者每一次新的爱国义举。生产方法的改革者（工业与农业的男女斯塔哈诺夫运动者）说：“我们是由斯大林教养的。”被我党教育出来的许多干部，说着同样的话。对他们热爱着的领袖与导师表示感激的全体苏联人民，也说着同样的话。
    在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中，布尔什维克党已受到更进一步的锻炼，并已成为苏维埃社会更强大的领导力量与指导力量，它的威信已日益增高，而它和最广大劳动群众的联系也已日益加强。由于斯大林同志非凡的远见及其不妥协性，党已经揭穿并击败了托洛茨基——布哈林分子及其他叛徒——列宁主义不共戴天的敌人。
    斯大林的英明领导，保证了我国社会主义的胜利。这胜利已由苏联宪法在立法上体现出来，而这宪法是被我国人民亲热地称为斯大林宪法，来纪念它的伟大的创造者的。斯大林宪法已成为全世界劳动人民的旗帜与战斗的行动纲领。
    哈萨克斯坦的百龄老诗人江布尔曾称斯大林为“全世界的导师”。他为这位伟大的领袖而作诗，他的诗篇里洋溢着无限的热爱。他说：假如斯大林与我们同在，真理就与我们同在，假如斯大林与我们同在，我们就坚强，假如斯大林与我们同在，幸福、强大而阳光普照的国家的旗帜就骄傲地迎风飘扬！
    斯大林同志领导党沿着社会主义的胜利道路前进，他已使马克思、恩格斯和列宁的学说提升到最高的水平。马列主义科学的首领斯大林同志，独创地发展着马列主义理论的一切基本学说，科学地总结着苏联社会主义建设的经验，总结着国际革命运动的经验。在最广大的劳动人民群众中深深地生根的斯大林思想，已成为强有力的物质力量，加速着历史发展的进程。在斯大林同志领导之下，苏联人民在伟大的爱国战争时期所获得的无可比拟的英雄业迹，将永远活在各国人民的记忆里。进步的苏联军事科学的创造者斯大林大元帅，草拟了并执行了光辉地击败敌人的战略计划，使大战的过程遵从自己的意志，并使苏联各民族人民在最大的战争中赢得了具有世界重要性的胜利。伟大的爱国战争胜利结束之后，苏联各民族人民便在斯大林同志指导下开始了大规模的和平创造工作。斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日选民大会上他那划时代的演说中，曾提纲洁领地标揭出我国建设共产主义的辉煌计划。全苏联人民以巨大的热情着手履行斯大林战后五年计划。我们的工业已开始迅速地发展；社会主义农业也在大踏步前进。在我国的强有力的经济高涨的基础之上，劳动人民的物质福利正在不断地增高。进步的科学暴风雨般地发展着，社会主义的文化在繁荣着。联共（布）中央委员会根据斯大林同志的提议而作出的关于文学和艺术的决定，已将全部思想工作提高到更高的水平。
    履行着斯大林的天才的草案，我们的光辉的共产党——共产主义的一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——正在日益发展和强大。布尔什维克党关切地促进一切新事物的进步和发展，并坚决地进行反对停滞和堕性的斗争。斯大林同志的关于发展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的指示，是在指导着我们党的全部工作。
    伟大的斯大林是国际工人阶级的领袖和导师。斯大林同志的著作，使共产党和工人阶级政党得以了解社会主义发展的规律和阶级斗争的规律，得以精通革命运动的战略与策略，它们教导这些党以无产阶级国际主义的精神、革命觉悟和对社会主义之敌人的不宽容态度。
    各国的劳动人民向伟大的和平旗手斯大林同志致贺。斯大林同志所发出的为反对帝国主义新战争挑拨者而进行斗争的号召，在各国间得到了最广泛的响应。在历史上第一次组成了团结着数以亿计的和平战士强有力的和平阵线。斯大林同志的名字是全世界工人最珍爱的名字。在斯大林同志的领导之下，社会主义在我国的胜利，在全世界工人和农民的心中燃起了解放的希望。目前，有千百万的人民在社会主义的旗帜之下生活和战斗。全世界的劳动人民热爱斯大林专心致力于他们的利益，热爱他的坚决、镇定、精力和决心，热爱他的革命的预见和智慧。我们生活在伟大的斯大林的时代。当我们认识到我们是由伟大的受人敬爱的斯大林所领导与指引，并认识到他正为我们指出走向光明前途的道路时，这给了我们——共产主义建设的参加者很大的愉快。斯大林的名字象征着胜利的苏联的伟大，它号召全世界人民为更好的将来、为人类的幸福而斗争！在世界的每一个角落，在各种语言及各种方言的地方，今天，从人民的内心里都发出这样的话：为全世界劳动人类的幸福，祝斯大林——伟大的领袖、导师和友人——健康和长寿！在伟大的斯大林的英明领导之下走向共产主义！
