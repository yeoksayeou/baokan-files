Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th: Tanaka Hatsuko, the representative of Japanese women residents in China, spoke at the Asian Women's Representative Conference on the 13th. The following is a summary:

　　Japanese women have great hopes for this Asian Women's Representative Conference, because it will unite all Asian women to defend Asian peace and democracy. We express our utmost anger at the US imperialism and the Yoshida reactionary government for prohibiting Japanese representatives from attending. We suggest that the conference lodge a serious protest with US imperialism and the Yoshida reactionary government. At the same time, we hope that the sisters of the International Democratic Women's Federation, the Soviet Union, China and other countries and nationalities will give friendly guidance and assistance to the suffering Japanese women. We request the American guest sisters attending the meeting to convey our appeal to American women: In order to safeguard the interests of women and children of all nations (including American women and children), please recall your husbands and sons from Japan! Withdraw US troops stationed in Japan! We call on American women to join us in opposing the conspiracy to foster the revival of Japanese fascism and to turn Japan into a base for US imperialism to launch a new war.

　　We are determined to humbly learn from sisters of all countries, especially from Soviet and Chinese women! We will resolutely fight for the people's democracy and women's liberation in Japan, and for lasting world peace!

    【新华社北京十四日电】在华日本侨民妇女代表田中玻真子十三日在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言，摘要如下：
    日本妇女对于这次亚洲妇女代表会议抱有极大的希望。因为它将使全亚洲的妇女团结起来，保卫亚洲的和平民主。我们对于美帝国主义和吉田反动政府禁止日本代表出席，表示万分愤怒。我们建议大会向美帝国主义及吉田反动政府提出严重抗议。同时希望国际民主妇联、苏联、中国及其他各国各民族的姊妹们，对于受苦难的日本妇女给以友谊的指导和援助。我们请求出席会议的美国来宾姊妹们向美国妇女转达我们的呼吁：为拥护各民族的妇女儿童（包括美国的妇女儿童在内）的利益，请由日本唤回你们的丈夫和儿子！撤退驻日美军！我们号召美国妇女们与我们共同反对扶植日本法西斯复活，反对把日本变成美帝国主义进行新战争的根据地的阴谋。
    我们坚决向各国姊妹们虚心学习，特别要向苏联和中国妇女学习！我们要为日本国内人民民主与妇女解放，为争取世界的持久和平而坚决奋斗！
