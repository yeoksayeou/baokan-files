　　Improving Agricultural Science and Technology Knowledge
  　Shanxi Trains Agricultural Cadres
  　Over 1,200 People Across the Province Have Participated
    [Our Newspaper's report] Shanxi Province plans to train over 1,200 agricultural cadres across the province in five regions this winter to improve their scientific and technical agricultural knowledge, strengthen leadership in rural production, and prepare to launch an increased production campaign next year. The training content will focus on scientific and technical aspects, accounting for about 80% of the curriculum. The emphasis will be on technical education in cultivation, seed selection, pest and disease control, and cultivation methods for S-character cotton and Golden-character cotton. Other topics include the cultivation and curing of Golden Tobacco leaves, fruit tree cultivation, and prevention of livestock epidemics. Additionally, the course will cover various reward policies related to agricultural production, leadership methods, urban-rural relations, industry-agriculture relations, and the importance of organization. The Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture has compiled and printed over 10,000 copies of ten agricultural technical manuals, which are being distributed for application in various locations.
    Training class locations are set up in Taiyuan, Changzhi, Xingxian, Yicheng, and other places. Each session lasts one month, and two training sessions will be completed. The first session in each location began around the 15th. Participants include county and district agricultural officers, assistants, agricultural extension workers, and labor heroes and village cadres with rich production experience.
    The Changzhi Special District's training class, anticipating a short spring next year that may affect spring plowing, has combined cadres into one session and started on the 13th under the principle of not affecting winter production. The agricultural cadre training class directly managed by the Provincial Government also started on the 16th, with 230 students from the Fenyang, Yuci, and Xinxian Special Districts. Wu Guangtang, Director of the Department of Agriculture, and Han Dianyuan, former Director of the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the training class, respectively, with experts and technical personnel serving as technical instructors. The teaching method emphasizes close integration with practice, adopting a method that closely combines lectures, experiments, and discussions.

　　提高农业科学技术知识
  　山西集训农业干部
  　全省已有千二百余人参加
    【本报讯】山西省计划今冬分五区训练全省农业干部一千二百余人，以提高科学的农业技术知识，加强农村生产领导，准备开展明年增产运动。训练内容，有关科学技术的约占百分之八十，以耕作、选种、病虫害防治、斯字棉及金字棉栽培法等技术教育为重点，其次是黄金烟叶的栽培、烤制，果木栽培，农畜防疫等。此外并讲授有关农业生产的各种奖励政策、领导方法、城乡关系、工农业关系以及组织起来等问题。省府农业厅编印的十种农业技术手册万余本，正分发各地应用。
    训练班地址分设太原、长治、兴县、翼城等处。每期一个月，两期训练完毕。各地第一期均在十五日左右开学。参加者包括县区农业科员、助理员、农场推广员及富有生产经验的劳动英雄、村干部等。
    长治专区的训练班因估计明年春短，恐影响春耕，在不影响冬季生产原则下，已抽调干部合并在一期受训，于十三日开学。由省府直接主持的农业干部训练班亦于十六日开学，到汾阳、榆次、忻县三个专区学员二百三十人。农业厅厅长武光汤、原省农业试验场场长韩殿元分任训练班正副主任，由专家、技术人员担任技术教员。教授方法重视和实际联系，采取讲解、实验、讨论三者密切结合的方法。
