　　Beijing News: Beijing Municipal Women's Federation Chairman Zhang Xiaomei delivered a broadcast speech on the afternoon of the sixth on Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, titled "Our City's Women Warmly Welcome the Asian Women's Representative Conference." She said: The Asian Women's Representative Conference being held in the capital of China is an honor for the Chinese people and women, especially the people and women of Beijing. She pointed out: Although the representatives to this conference represent different ethnic groups and different languages, they have all come for one hope and one task. This hope is lasting world peace and people's democracy. This task is to unite the women of all Asia and the world, exchange experiences in struggle and construction from various countries, and discuss how to protect the rights and interests of women and children, in order to advance the Asian peace and democracy movement and the national liberation movement further. Therefore, it is a conference that symbolizes unity, a conference of historical significance and combativeness. We Beijing women must learn with great enthusiasm and humility from our international sisters, especially our Soviet sisters, learning their spirit of internationalism and learning their valuable experience in the struggle for peace and in production and construction. At the same time, we must warmly welcome and treat our sisters from all countries, so that they feel warm and comfortable both materially and spiritually. Finally, Chairman Zhang Xiaomei called on all women in the city to work actively, study hard, and use their greater achievements in production and construction and greater achievements in striving for women's work to celebrate the success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference.
