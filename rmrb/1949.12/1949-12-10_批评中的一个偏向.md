　　A Bias in Criticism
　　　　Zhen Tao
　　Recently, I saw an article on a school's wall newspaper, which contained the following passage:
　　"…Because my classmates have criticized me once or twice… for being undisciplined and not obeying group discipline, I have become a little wary of my daily routines these past few days. During the lunch break, I dare not stay out too long; after dinner, I hurry back from my walk very early. Why? This is the effect of the classmates' relentless criticism…."
　　On the surface, it seems that this student has been forced to correct the shortcomings of being undisciplined and not obeying group discipline due to the criticism of his classmates, but in reality, this student has not resolved the problem ideologically. This can be clearly seen in his article: "During the lunch break, I dare not stay out too long; after dinner, I hurry back from my walk very early." It can also be said that his reform is not because he recognizes his shortcomings, but because he is afraid of being criticized again.
　　Being afraid of criticism and daring not to change one's ways is fundamentally different from accepting criticism and changing one's ways. Reforming out of fear of criticism may lead to good behavior for a while, but in one's mind, there is still resistance. After a period of time, when the external pressure of criticism lessens or disappears, it is very likely to revert to old habits and repeat mistakes. However, a person who has truly accepted criticism not only corrects their actions but also recognizes their own shortcomings and the necessity of reform in their thinking.
　　This is a bias that is very likely to occur in criticism, especially when the person being criticized has not recognized the importance and necessity of criticism, and when the critics have not properly grasped the weapon of criticism, have not correctly understood the other party's ability to accept it, and are too hasty. This is a problem that deserves our attention.

### 批评中的一个偏向

　　批评中的一个偏向
    振  涛
    最近在一个学校的墙报上看到了一篇文章，中间有这样一段话：
    “……由于同学们一次二次……的批评我自由散漫，不遵守团体纪律，这几天我对生活规律有点戒心了。中午休息时间，我不敢在外停留太久，晚餐后的散步，我很早的就跑回来。什么缘故呢？这是同学们疲劳批评的效果……。”
    在表面看来，这同学确由于同学们的批评，把自由散漫，不遵守团体纪律的缺点被迫改正了，但实际上这个同学在思想上并没有解决问题。这在他的文章里：“中午休息时间，我不敢在外停留太久；晚餐后的散步，我很早的就跑回来。”这句话很明显地可以看出来，也可以说他的改过并不是因为他认识了他的缺点，而是因为怕人家再批评他。
    怕批评而不敢不改过，与接受批评而改过是有着基本上的不同。怕批评的改过，一时在行动上也可能好好做到，但在思想上还存在不服，过一个时期以后，外界批评的压力减轻或者没有时，又很可能故态复发，重犯错误。而真正已接受批评的人，不但在行动上改正了，在思想上亦能认识了他自己的缺点和改过的必要。
    这是在批评中很可能发生的一种偏向，尤其在被批评的人没有认识到批评的重要性和必要性时，在批评者没有好好掌握这批评的武器，没有正确了解对方的接受能力，而操之过急的情况下，最容易发生，这是值得我们注意的一个问题。
