　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (55)
　　Kang Tuo
　　After getting off work, Da Sancai called this group of water workers to the mine site and also called over Shuan Cheng, Tian Lu, Xi Lu, Lin Bao, Tai Cheng to resolve Niu Bao's matter together. But for some unknown reason, Da San wanted to speak peacefully, but he just couldn't manage it; he held back for a while, and in the end, he still said, "Fellows, we have quite a few clever people among our water workers! I think our leader has had it! Let Niu Bao take over!" Liu Goujia hurriedly said, "Look, wasn't I just arranging for you to not easily change your attitude..." Niu Bao interjected, "Da Sanye, I'm still at 1,630, how can you..." Da San said, "But you can't even handle 800!" Niu Bao's face turned red, but he still puffed out his chest and said, "Am I really that bad? I don't know what you're talking about!" Shuan Cheng and Tian Lu also told Da San to speak properly, but he waved his arm and exposed Niu Bao's slyness; people started criticizing Niu Bao one after another, even Gan Danao and Yu Bao started talking about him, and that kid Xi Lu even said, "You only fill half a basket before it flows back, so even if we dig 2,000 below, half of it will be wasted, and we'll have to dig again. Hehe, look at you..." Shuan Cheng, however, started lecturing Niu Bao to his face, saying that this is our own business now, that you're undermining the rules and violating discipline, that you still have many mistakes and have only just been forgiven by the masses... Da San also said, "Did you listen to what Shuan Cheng said? If it weren't for this time, I, Zhang Yuanlu, would have driven you away for sure, and left you far behind!" Niu Bao kept admitting his mistakes, and Shuan Cheng decided to submit the matter to the shareholders' meeting for discussion again before people dispersed.
　　After the matter was over, Shuan Cheng and Tian Lu again advised Da San: "Don't get angry!" Da San lowered his head and didn't say a word, but Liu Goujia pointed to the direction of the theater stage and said, "Look at you... people are still watching you over there!" It turned out that Bai Quanjia's group was still watching everything that had just happened over there; Da San couldn't help but feel his face burn, and he quietly said, "What are you meddling in!" Liu Goujia, however, waddled over to Bai Quanjia's side and quietly told them: why Da San got angry, and said, "He got angry for the sake of our mine! Besides, he's so capable! He can see through those slippery and cunning things at a glance! Bai Quanjia, don't hold a grudge!" Bai Quanjia blushed and jokingly hit Liu Goujia, while secretly laughing "giggle"; the group next to them burst out laughing. On the mine site side, the men heard so much laughter from the women and turned their faces to look; Little Foreign Devil was just coming back from relieving himself outside the mine and, seeing this scene, hurried towards the theater stage, shouting, "What are you happy about! Tell me so I can be happy too!" The women scattered with a hoot, and the men on the mine site clapped their hands one by one, craned their necks, and laughed so hard that they were pushing each other.
　　　　Fifty-two　Lantern Festival
　　After the fifth round of props was installed in the mine, another shareholders' meeting was held. Shuan Cheng reported on the situation of the mine and the review opinions of the shareholder representatives. The meeting approved the ten new shareholders who wanted to participate. Then, everyone criticized Niu Bao; among them, Da San said, "I think my understanding is wrong again! According to me, we should revoke his shareholder status!" Niu Bao hurriedly made self-criticism, confessed, and swore with his chest and feet that he would definitely correct himself. The meeting finally forgave him. In addition, everyone made suggestions about several lazy guys and advised them. Lao Yin also proposed: the good ones should also be rewarded, and everyone agreed, shouting in unison: "The number one hard worker is Tian Lu!" Da San said, "Tai Cheng! I propose rewarding Tai Cheng!" Tai Cheng angrily shouted, "Why me! Aren't you just being difficult again!" Da San said, "You used to produce eight or nine tons of coal a day, now it's twelve tons, that's why." People saw that Da San was sincere and felt that Tai Cheng was indeed good, so they also approved the reward for him. But Tai Cheng also proposed to reward Da San, but Da San refused to accept it, saying, "First of all, my attitude and temper are not qualified to be rewarded! I'll wait until I change." People couldn't persuade him, so they let it go. Finally, Little Foreign Devil shouted: we didn't have a good New Year after liberation, and the Lantern Festival is coming soon. According to the old rules of the mine, we have to take a big rest for three days anyway, so his idea is to celebrate the Lantern Festival. This was immediately approved by the whole audience. After the meeting, the whole village immediately responded. On the thirteenth day of the lunar calendar, the seventh round of props was installed in the east mine, and Da San estimated that nearly 50,000 loads of water had been pumped out, and several dry branch roads had appeared at the bottom of the mine, where coal could be dug! The village also posted the final list of class statuses and the land measurement and yield evaluation accounts, and it was about to allocate land: so every household relaxed and celebrated the New Year and the Lantern Festival together.
　　On the fourteenth, the village built seven archways, and colorful lanterns were hung on the archways. On the archway banners, pillars, and colored paper on the lanterns that used to write lantern riddles, were written "Overturn and Liberate," "Eliminate Feudalism," "Return Land to the People," "Mine More Coal," "Long Live the Communist Party"... and someone drew some pictures of the masses overturning and sticking them on the big paper lanterns in the middle of the archways; red and green lanterns were in front of every house, and forty or fifty "club fires" were burning red and bright in the whole village: this fire was a hollow cylinder made of broken bricks, like a tower, smeared with mud on the outside, with holes connected layer by layer around it, and two loads of charcoal were poured into the cylinder to burn, which was indeed warming.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５５）
    康濯
    赶下了班，大三才把这班水工叫到窑场上，又把拴成天禄喜禄林宝泰成都寻来，一道解决牛宝的事。但不知怎么个缘由，大三想平平和和说话，却总办不到；他别了一阵，最后还是说：“伙计，咱们这水工里头可有的是机灵人哩！我看咱这领事的吹了吧！牛宝来干吧！”柳沟家忙道：“你看，我不是刚安插过叫你别轻易动态度……”牛宝抢着说：“大三爷，咱可还是一千六百三，你怎么……”大三道：“可你连八百也顶不住！”牛宝红了脸，但还是胸脯一挺道：“我他妈就那么点？没见你这是说哪里话的！”拴成天禄也叫大三快好好说，他就胳膊一挥，大撒手揭开了牛宝的耍猾；人们一时都批评开了牛宝，就连干大脑和玉宝也说开了他，喜禄他小子并说：“你这打一壳篓就倒流一半的，咱们在下边就打二千吧，也有一半白闹，还得重打过。嘿嘿，看你这……”拴成却当面教化起牛宝来，什么这是咱自己的营生啦，你这么闹也破坏了章程、犯了纪律啦，你还是错误很多，刚被群众宽大了的啦……大三又道：“拴成说的你都听了么？你他妈要不是这会，我张远禄准得撵走你，外加还撂你远远的！”牛宝直一个劲认错，拴成决定了把这事再交股东大会讨论，人们才散。
    事情过后，拴成天禄又打劝大三：“不要动火嘛！”大三低着脑袋不啃声，柳沟家却指着戏楼地那边说：“你看你这是……人家还正看你哩！”原来刚才的一切，白泉家那伙还都在那边看着；大三不觉脸发烫，只悄悄道：“你鬼捣什么哩！”柳沟家却又扭着小脚，跑过了白泉家那边，悄悄告给她们：大三为什么动火，并道：“人家动火可也是为的咱这窑哩！再说，人家本事多大哟！那号跳皮耍猾的事，他一眼就看穿！白泉家你可甭结记呀！”白泉家红着脸，不真不假地打柳沟家，一边偷偷“吃吃”地笑；旁边那伙子却哈哈大笑起来。窑场这边，汉汉们听见那么些妇女的笑声，都转过脸来看；小洋鬼这时正出窑解手回来，见了这情景，不觉忙往戏楼的这边跑着，一边吆喝：“你们欢喜什么哩！可告咱听听，也让咱欢喜欢喜呀！”妇女们哄地一声跑了，窑场这边汉汉们一个个拍着巴掌，仰着脖子，直笑得你打我推的。
    　　　　五十二　元宵
    窑底安上第五道旋以后，又召开了股东大会。拴成报告了窑上的情形和股东代表会的检讨意见，会上通过了新要求参加的十个股东，接着，大家就批评牛宝；这当中大三说道：“我这认识许又是错误！依着我呀，得取消了他这股东！牛宝忙检讨、坦白，并捶胸跺脚地发誓一定改正，会上总算宽大了他；另外，大家还提出了几个懒派家伙进行了劝告。老尹又提议：好的也该奖励，大家同意了，并一音喊着：“头号买力气的数天禄！”大三却道：“泰成！我提议奖励泰成！”泰成生气地嚷道：“我凭什么哩！你这不又是闹别扭”！大三道：“你往日一天出八九吨炭，如今十二吨的，就凭这。”人们看出大三是真心，又觉着泰成还就是不赖，便也通过了奖他。但泰成又提出要奖大三，大三却死也不接受，他说：“头一条，咱这态度脾性就没资格受奖！等我改了再说。”人们别不过他，也就算了。最后，小洋鬼大呼大叫地提出：咱解放后头一个年也没好好过，眼下元宵快到，窑上老规矩反正要大歇三天，他的意见是要闹闹元宵。这立时得到全场通过，散会以后，浑村也马上响应了。到阴历十三，东窑按上了七道旋，大三估量快打了五万担水，窑底也出来了好几道干岔道，能刨炭了！村里并又贴出了最后的成份榜和地亩丈量产量评议帐目，眼看也就要配搭土地：于是家家户户松了松心，连年带元宵一道正经过起来。
    十四，村里搭起了七个牌楼，牌楼上挂彩灯，牌楼横披、立柱和灯上旧日写灯迷的色纸上，都写着“翻身解放”“消灭封建”“土地还家”“多开煤矿”“共产党万岁”……还有不知什么人画了些群众翻身的画，贴在牌楼当间的大纸灯上；家家门前红绿灯，全村四五十炉“棒锤火”红旺旺地生着：这火是人们用碎砖垒成的空心圆筒筒，象塔一样，外面抹上泥，四周一层层地通上窟窿眼，担两担炭倒在圆筒里生着，确是烘火。
