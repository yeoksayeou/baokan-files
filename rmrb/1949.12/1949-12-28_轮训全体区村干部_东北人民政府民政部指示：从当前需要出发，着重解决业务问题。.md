Rotating Training of All District and Village Cadres
Northeast People's Government Ministry of Civil Affairs Instructs: Focus on Solving Business Problems Based on Current Needs.
[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Northeast People's Government issued an instruction to all provinces and cities on the 10th of this month regarding the winter training of district and village administrative cadres. The instruction stated:

In recent years, a large number of rural district and village cadres have been cultivated and promoted continuously during the war, support for the war, and the land reform movement. These cadres have already experienced the tests of various tasks and struggles. All government laws and policies concerning rural areas depend on their specific implementation. However, due to the lack of systematic learning opportunities in the past, they have not received the improvement they deserve. Currently, as the Northeast has entered a period of comprehensive economic construction, various tasks require rapid improvement. The existing experience and abilities of district and village cadres have fallen behind the needs of the situation and the development of work. This situation must be changed quickly, otherwise our work cannot move forward. Therefore, governments at all levels should attach great importance to how to properly conduct winter training for district and village administrative cadres, so as to improve their work. This should be regarded as one of the important tasks of each county this winter, and the responsible comrades of each county should be instructed to earnestly and conscientiously preside over and lead it.

In order to make the training practical, it is necessary to first grasp the actual problems existing in the work and the ideological style of the cadres, and proceed from the needs of the current central work. Therefore, we should focus on studying and solving problems in business and work, and combine this with ideological and stylistic training and policy education. Each session should preferably train village cadres and district assistants with the same nature of work, in order to facilitate communication of work relationships, exchange of experience, and facilitate inspection and deployment of work. The order of training should be based on solving urgent problems as a prerequisite, such as: winter sideline production, that is, training production committee members and district production assistants; convening village people's representative conferences, then training village chairmen and civil affairs assistants, etc. Each locality can determine the number of training sessions and training methods according to specific circumstances.

Each county should formulate a specific and comprehensive training plan according to the number of district and village cadres, and strive to universally rotate and train district and village cadres once in the four or five months of this winter and next spring. The number of trainees in each session can be determined according to the specific circumstances of each county, and the time should be 10 days to half a month. The training methods should be lively and practical, avoid old routines and formalism, and minimize large lectures. Methods such as typical reports, summarizing experiences, discussions, and symposiums can be adopted, and attention should be paid to understanding and reviewing in order to appropriately adjust the cadres.

At the end of each training session, a brief test and summary should be conducted, and the post-training work should be arranged and inspected to understand the training effect and promptly enrich and improve the training methods.

In addition, the situations in the new and old areas are still different. The district and village cadres in the new areas have a short history, and their struggle experience and work experience are insufficient, so special attention should be paid to their training work. Each locality can implement this according to the actual situation, but the provincial government should specifically plan for the longer-term training of key district-level administrative cadres to study at the provincial administrative cadre school.

　　轮训全体区村干部
    东北人民政府民政部指示：从当前需要出发，着重解决业务问题。
    【本报讯】东北人民政府民政部于本月十日向各省市发布了关于区、村行政干部冬季训练指示。指示称：
    几年以来，不断的在战争与支援战争以及土地改革运动中培养提拔了大批农村的区、村干部，这批干部并已经历了各种工作与斗争的考验，政府一切有关农村法令政策，有赖于他们具体执行，但因过去缺乏有系统的学习机会，没有得到应有的提高。在目前东北已进入全面经济建设时期，各种工作要求迅速提高、区、村干部已有的经验与能力便落后于形势与工作发展的需要，这种情况必须迅速改变，否则我们的工作就不能前进。因此各级政府对如何办好区、村行政干部的冬季训练，将干部提高一步，以改进其工作，应当十分重视。并以此做为今冬各县重要任务之一，应即责成各县负责同志切实认真主持领导。
    为了使训练切合实际，必须首先掌握工作中存在的实际问题及干部的思想作风，并从当前中心工作的需要出发。因此应着重研究解决业务与工作中的问题。联系给以思想作风训练与政策教育。每期最好按同一工作性质的村干部与区助理员进行训练，以便沟通工作关系，交换经验，并便于检查与布置工作。其训练的次序则以解决迫待解决的问题为前提，如：冬季副业生产即训练生产委员与区生产助理员；召开村的人民代表大会，则训练村主席与民政助理员等，各地可依具体情况确定训练次与训练方法。
    各县应按照区、村干部的数量订出具体统盘的训练计划，力求在今冬明春的四、五个月中把区、村干部普遍轮训一次，每期训练人数可根据各县具体情况决定，时间以十天至半月为宜。训练方法要生动与切合实际，切忌老一套与形式主义，尽量少讲大课，可采取典型报告，总结经验，讨论、座谈会等方式，并注意了解审查，以便适当的调整干部。
    每期训练结束时，应进行简要的测验与总结，并布置检查训练后的工作情况，借以了解训练效果，及时充实改进训练方法。
    此外，新、老地区情况尚有不同，新区的区、村干部因历史短，斗争锻炼与工作考验尚不足，尤应注意其培养训练工作，对此各地可根据实际情况执行，但对区级主要行政干部，较长期的培养训练，应由各省府具体计划调省行政干部学校学习。
