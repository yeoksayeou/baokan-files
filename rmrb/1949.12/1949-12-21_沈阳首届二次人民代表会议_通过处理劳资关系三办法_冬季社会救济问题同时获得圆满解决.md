Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: The first second session of the Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference concluded successfully on November 22nd, lasting two and a half days. The main agenda of the meeting was to discuss and approve three provisional methods for handling labor-capital relations (namely, the Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations, the Provisional Measures for Handling Labor Dispute Procedures, and the Provisional Measures for Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises to Conclude Collective Contracts between Labor and Capital). The meeting also discussed and decided on winter relief work, listened to a brief report by Mayor Zhu Qiwen on the government's work since the first representative meeting. The representatives made suggestions and criticisms of the government's work at the meeting. Finally, the Shenyang Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference was elected.

Regarding the handling of labor-capital relations, ample preparation was made before the meeting. In September, the Municipal Labor Bureau distributed the draft of the three provisional methods to employees of private enterprises for discussion. The employees made many supplementary suggestions during the discussion, such as adding to the draft "Labor has the right to make suggestions to capital on production," "Labor has the right to report and accuse capital of illegal acts to the government," and "The labor union has the right to introduce employees." The first Shenyang Municipal Employee Representative Conference held on October 5th also discussed the supplemented draft and made some revisions. Finally, it was submitted to this People's Representative Conference for discussion. At the same time, the capital side also began to prepare in mid-October. The main opinions they put forward during the discussion were: to change "Labor must notify capital five days in advance before resigning" to "ten days," to change "Labor should respect capital's management rights over production and business" to "obey," to remove the word "挾嫌 (xie xian - harboring suspicion)" from "Capital shall not dismiss workers on suspicion," and to add "must have a doctor's certificate" to the item on leave for female employees who are pregnant or have a miscarriage. In addition, many reasons for unconditionally dismissing employees were also put forward. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau sent these opinions of the capital side to the workers for discussion again. The workers paid great attention to these revised articles of the capital side and felt that the capital side was excessively unreasonable and harsh. They carefully prepared their opinions and repeatedly studied the draft. According to the opinions of both labor and capital, the leading organs of Shenyang City conducted special research.

		Incorrect Opinions of Capital Representatives Corrected After Labor Criticism

On the first day of the conference, after Mayor Zhu Qiwen explained the basic spirit of the three drafts, the worker representatives spoke first, supporting the three drafts and putting forward some concessionary revisions, such as the female worker representative proposing to change "full salary" during the maternity period for female workers as stipulated in the draft to "two-thirds of the salary." The capital representatives then spoke, mostly with the same opinions as before the meeting. In order to allow the representatives to speak fully, it was later decided to hold group meetings first. The nine representative groups, including employees, industry and commerce, culture and education, military, youth, women, farmers, streets, and joint, discussed separately. A general discussion was held in the evening. At the conference, the worker representatives refuted some of the opinions of the capital side, criticizing the capital side's attempt to retain and restore the old labor-capital relationship by changing respect to obedience; notifying the capital side ten days before resigning actually eliminated the labor's freedom to resign, because workers have to find a new employer before they can resign, and the new employer will never allow the worker to delay for ten days before starting work. As for the capital side's proposal to remove the words "挾嫌 (xie xian - harboring suspicion)," saying that these two words did not look good, the worker representatives cited specific facts of the capital side dismissing workers without cause on suspicion to refute it. Representatives from the military, culture and education, women, youth, and other sectors also spoke successively, criticizing some of the opinions of the capital side as inappropriate. At this time, the capital representatives were silent. At the conference that day, two capital representatives spoke to admit that their opinions were wrong.

On the second day of the conference, another group meeting was held. First, the presidium absorbed some representatives from both labor and capital sides and convened an enlarged meeting of the presidium to explain the government's attitude and encourage them to speak freely and exhaustively. Mayor Zhu personally participated in the discussion of the industrial and commercial representative group. During the item-by-item discussion at the group meeting, the capital side mostly withdrew some of its original opinions, but still believed that the labor's notification to the capital side five days before resigning was too short. Later, when someone asked about the old rules, the capital side admitted that there were no regulations in the past, and that workers would pack their luggage and leave on any day they didn't want to work; this proves that the regulations in today's draft are precisely taking care of the capital side's production. The word "挾嫌 (xie xian - harboring suspicion)" was discussed for one and a half hours, and the capital side insisted on removing it. During the discussion, someone from the capital side proposed changing "挾嫌 (xie xian - harboring suspicion)" to "借故 (jie gu - pretext)," and the capital representatives had all agreed at the beginning, but later someone raised an objection, believing that the scope of "借故 (jie gu - pretext)" was too broad and feared that labor-capital disputes would arise in the future. Later, when someone mentioned the example of signing a collective contract in the iron industry, pointing out that the workers at that time requested to remove the words "怠工 (dai gong - malingering)" from it, but the capital side disagreed, and the words were still retained; then the capital side agreed not to remove the words "挾嫌 (xie xian - harboring suspicion)."

At the afternoon plenary session, several representatives of the capital side spoke, unanimously acknowledging that many of the opinions on the first day were inappropriate, and expressed their full support for the government's three drafts and the supplementary opinions of the employee delegation. Employee representatives and other representatives from all walks of life welcomed and encouraged the progress shown by the industrial and commercial representatives in their speeches. One capital representative said: "If we give the workers less money, it is to save more wealth for the country, and if we ask the workers to work harder, it is also to create more wealth for the country." The worker representatives immediately pointed out that this statement was an attempt to paralyze the workers and intensify the exploitation of the workers. The meeting finally unanimously adopted the above three drafts.

Another central topic of the meeting, the winter social relief issue, was also resolved successfully. According to a survey by the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, there are more than 2,500 households and more than 8,500 people in the city who need relief, including nearly 960 people who are homeless and jobless and need to be taken in, including vagrants and scattered soldiers. If they are not properly handled, it will inevitably hinder social order and security, and is closely related to the lives of people from all walks of life; and relying solely on the government to handle it will require a huge financial expenditure. At the meeting, representatives from all walks of life warmly expressed their willingness to donate. For example, the Shenyang Municipal organs are willing to donate one day's food expenses per person; theaters are willing to give charity performances; and representatives of honorary soldiers are willing to donate their disability pensions. The meeting established a relief committee, including representatives from all walks of life, as the leading organization for social relief in Shenyang, and determined the principles of combining relief work with production, concentrating vagrants for transformation and organizing their employment, and basing donations on voluntarism. In this way, not only can the state's financial expenditure be saved, but also a preliminary foundation can be laid for future relief work. This fact also fully demonstrates the great role of the People's Representative Conference in promoting various tasks.

		Representatives Support Winter Relief and Make Suggestions to the Government

The last half day of the meeting was for the representatives to make suggestions and criticisms to the government. All the representatives who made suggestions were very sincere, and the suggestions they made were mostly correct. For example, it was proposed that the tax bureau shorten the tax collection period each time, and not accumulate for several months before collecting it. Some representatives criticized the staff of the Electric Power Bureau for their poor work style when checking electricity, arbitrarily cutting off electric wires, etc. For example, some representatives criticized that there is not enough steel material now, but some places are manufacturing iron beds. In addition to expressing their sincere acceptance of these opinions, the government representatives also praised the representatives who were active and responsible, cared about the government's work, and made criticisms to the government.

This Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference was relatively successful. The content of the conference was chosen appropriately, solving the urgent labor-capital relations and relief issues, and ample preparation was made before the meeting. This is an important foundation for the final basic consensus of opinions between labor and capital at the meeting. Some incorrect opinions of the capital side during the conference were finally resolved after criticism from other representatives at the meeting and explanations from government officials. In the final speeches on this issue at the conference, representatives from all parties welcomed the progress shown by the capital side in accepting criticism, which was also an important step in solidarity. In this conference, the spirit of the people's democratic united front was generally well grasped, but there were still areas where attention was not sufficient. For example, when arguing about issues, it was not possible to fully reason with a calm and peaceful attitude, and the phenomenon of excessively agitated attitudes often occurred. The candidates for this People's Political Consultative Conference were not adequately prepared and not fully considered, which was a major shortcoming. There were more absences from the organs, and some people arbitrarily withdrew from the meeting midway. When the representatives made suggestions and criticisms to the government, individual government officials did not attend to listen. These shortcomings need to be corrected in the future in order to further improve the work of the People's Representative Conference and the People's Democratic United Front.

The experience of this conference proves that the central content of the meeting should not be too much, and it is more appropriate to solve one or two problems each time. Sufficient preparation should be made before the meeting in conjunction with regular work. For the current major issues that the people demand to be resolved, the government should prepare in a timely manner, and submit them to the People's Representative Conference for discussion when they are relatively mature. The presidium of the conference should grasp the ideological dynamics of all levels and carry out meticulous organizational work. Careless negligence will cause serious shortcomings and errors. At each conference, half a day should be set aside for the representatives to make suggestions and criticisms to the government, and all department chiefs and above of the government should attend to listen, which is a good way to closely link the government with the people and overcome bureaucracy.

### 沈阳首届二次人民代表会议　通过处理劳资关系三办法  冬季社会救济问题同时获得圆满解决

　　沈阳首届二次人民代表会议
    通过处理劳资关系三办法         
    冬季社会救济问题同时获得圆满解决
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】沈阳市首届二次人民代表会议已于十一月二十二召开，历时两天半即圆满团幕。会议主要议程是讨论并通过处理劳资关系的三个暂行办法（即处理劳资关系暂行办法、处理劳资争议程序暂行办法、私营工商企业劳资双方订立集体合同暂行办法）。会中还讨论并决定了冬季救济工作，听取了朱其文市长关于第一次代表会议以来政府施政情形的简单报告，各代表在会上并对政府工作提出建议和批评，最后选举成立沈阳市人民协商委员会。
    关于处理劳资关系问题，在会前即进行了充分的酝酿准备工作。九月间市劳动局即将三个暂行办法草案发给私营企业职工进行讨论。职工在讨论中提出许多补充意见，如在草案中增添了“劳方有向资方提出对生产的建议之权”，“对资方的违法行为有向政府举发控告之权”，“工会有介绍职工之权”等。十月五日召开的沈市首届职工代表大会又对经过补充的草案进行讨论，并作了若干修正。最后才提交这次人民代表会议讨论。同时资方自十月中旬也开始酝酿，他们在讨论中提出的主要意见是：将“劳方辞雇须于五天前通知资方”改为“十天”，将“劳方应尊重资方对生产业务之管理权”改为“遵从”，取消“资方不得挟嫌解雇工人”中的“挟嫌”字，女职工怀孕小产的休假一项中增加“要有医生诊断书证明”等。此外，并提出许多无条件解雇职工的理由。沈阳市人民政府劳动局将资方的这些意见又交到工人中去讨论。工人对资方这些修正条文很注意，觉得资方过分无理与苛刻。他们很慎重地准备了意见，并再三研究草案。根据劳资双方意见，沈阳市的领导机关进行了专门研究。
    　　　　资方代表不正确意见　经劳工批驳获得纠正
    大会第一日，朱其文市长对三草案的基本精神作了解释后，工人代表首先发言，拥护这三个草案，并提出某些让步的修正意见，如女工代表提出将草案中规定的女工生育期间“照发工资”改为“发工资三分之二”。继由资方代表发言，大部仍系会前所提之意见。为了与会代表能充分发言，后来决定先开小组会。按职工、工商、文教、军队、青年、妇女、农民、街道、联合等九个代表团分别讨论。晚间进行大会讨论。大会上，工人代表反驳了资方的某些意见，批评资方将尊重改为遵从是资方企图保留与恢复旧的劳资关系；辞雇前十天通知资方，实际上是取消了的劳方的辞雇自由，因为工人是要找着新的主雇才能辞雇的，而新的主雇决不会容许工人拖延十天才上工。至于资方提出取消“挟嫌”字样，说这两个字不好看，工人代表则举出资方挟嫌无故解雇工人的具体事实，予以批驳。军队、文教、妇女、青年等各界代表，亦先后发言，批评资方某些意见不恰当。这时资方代表均默默无言。这一天的大会上有两个资方代表发言表示承认自己的意见不对。
    大会第二日又开小组会。先由主席团吸收劳资双方部分代表，召开主席团扩大会议，说明政府态度，鼓励知无不言，言无不尽。朱市长并亲自参加了工商业代表小组的讨论。资方在小组会上的逐条讨论中，大部分都收回了原来的某些意见，但仍认为劳方于辞雇前五天通知资方，时间太短促。后来当有人追问过去的老规矩时，资方始承认过去根本没有规定，那一天工人不愿意干了，卷起行李就走；这证明今天草案中这样规定，正是照顾了资方生产的。对“挟嫌”二字，讨论了一点半钟，资方都坚持取消。在讨论中，资方有人提出改“挟嫌”为“借故”，开始资方代表大家都已经同意，但以后又有人提出异议，认为“借故”范围太宽，怕将来闹劳资纠纷。后来，有人提出签订铁工业集体合同的例子时，指出当时工人要求去掉其中“怠工”二字，资方不同意，结果仍然留着；于是资方才同意不去掉“挟嫌”二字。
    下午开大会时，资方代表数人讲话，一致承认第一天的许多意见不妥当，并表示完全拥护政府的三个草案和职工代表团的补充意见。职工代表及其他各界代表在发言中，对工商业代表所表示的这种进步，加以欢迎和鼓励。有一个资方代表说：“我们少给工人几个钱，是为国家多省一点财富，我们要求工人多干一点，也是给国家多创造些财富。”工人代表当即指出这种说法是企图麻痹工人，加重对工人的剥削。会议最后一致通过了上述三个草案。
    会议另一个中心议题是冬季社会救济问题，亦得到了圆满解决。据市府民政局调查，全市需要救济的有二千五百余户，八千五百余人，其中无家无业需要收容的近九百六十余人，其中包括游民、散兵等。对他们如果不妥善处理，势必妨害社会秩序和治安，关系各界人民生活甚大；而单靠政府处理，则需一笔巨大的财政开支。会上，各界代表皆热烈表示愿意捐助。如沈市各机关愿每人捐献一天的粮食菜金；戏院愿作义演；荣誉军人代表则愿献残废金。会议成立了包括各界代表人士的救济委员会，为沈市社会救济的领导组织，并确定了救济工作与生产结合，集中游民进行改造并组织其就业，捐助要基于自愿等项原则。这样，不仅可节省国家财政开支，且为今后的救济工作奠定了初步基础。这一事实，也充分证明人民代表会议在推动各种工作上的巨大作用。
    　　　　各代表支持冬季救济提出对政府工作建议
    会议最后半天，是各代表对政府提出建议和批评。所有提意见的代表态度都很诚恳，提的意见大都是正确的。如提议税务局缩短每次收税期间，不要积压数月才征收一次。有的代表批评电业局人员查电时作风不好，随便割断电线等。又如有的代表批评现在钢铁材料不够，有些地方却在制造铁床。对这些意见，政府代表除表示诚恳接受外，并表扬了积极负责，关心政府工作，对政府提出批评的代表。
    这一次的沈阳市人民代表会议是比较成功的。会议的内容选择的比较恰当，解决急待解决的劳资关系问题与救济问题，会前又经过长时间的准备工作。这是在会议上劳资双方意见最后能够达到基本上一致的重要基础。在大会过程中资方的某些不正确意见，经过会议中其他代表的批评与政府负责人的解释，终于获得解决。大会上关于这个问题的最后发言中，各方代表欢迎资方接受批评所表示的进步，也是一个重要的团结步骤。这次会议中，对人民民主统一战线的精神一般掌握得还好，但是仍有注意不够的地方。例如争论问题时未能完全做到心平气和地充分说理，常常发生态度过分激动的现象。这次人民协商委员会的人选酝酿不够，考虑不周，是一大缺点。机关代表缺席较多，有些人随便中途退席。代表对政府提出建议和批评时，个别政府负责干部未曾出席倾听。这些缺点，都需要在今后注意改正，以便更进一步地做好人民代表会议和人民民主统一战线的工作。
    这次会议的经验证明：会议的中心内容不可太多，每次解决一两个问题，是比较合适的。会前应结合经常工作，进行充分的准备。凡人民要求解决的当前重大问题，政府应及时酝酿准备，比较成熟时，提交人民代表会议讨论。会议的主席团应该掌握各阶层的思想动态，并进行细密的组织工作，草率疏忽是会造成严重的缺点和错误的。每次会议，都应规定半天时间，由各代表对政府工作提出建议和批评，政府各部门科长以上干部，均应出席倾听，这是密切政府与人民联系，克服官僚主义的和很好方法。
