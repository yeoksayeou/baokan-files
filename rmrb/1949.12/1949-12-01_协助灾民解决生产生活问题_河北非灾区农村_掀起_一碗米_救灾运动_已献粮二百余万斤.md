  　Hebei Non-Disaster Area Rural Areas
    Launch "A Bowl of Rice" Disaster Relief Campaign
    Over Two Million Jin of Grain Donated
    [From Our Newspaper] A "Bowl of Rice" disaster relief campaign is being launched everywhere in the vast rural areas of Hebei Province that are not affected by the disaster. District and village cadres, and Communist Party members in the countryside, are actively responding to the call from higher authorities, saving and donating, and deeply publicizing the significance of disaster relief. Some villages guide farmers to recall past famines, inspiring everyone's sympathy for the disaster victims and encouraging active donations. In the "A Bowl of Rice" disaster relief campaign launched in more than 20 counties including Xincheng, Dingxing, Laishui, Yicheng, Qingyuan, Wuji, and Raoyang, more than 1.9 million jin of grain, and tens of thousands of jin of bran, vegetables, dates, and pears have been donated. In the Xingtai Special District, according to statistics from early October, 727 natural villages in Xingtai County donated more than 40,000 jin of millet. Cadres in the government offices of Neiqiu, Lincheng, Shahe, Pingxiang and other counties have also formulated savings plans and are enthusiastically donating. The work of governments at all levels in resettling disaster victims in severely affected areas is also proceeding extremely smoothly, with the vast majority of disaster victims having their living problems resolved. For example, in the Fifth District of Mancheng County, Hebei, 293 households and 1,493 people displaced from the flooded areas of Anxin, Gaoyang and other counties have been relocated. With the enthusiastic help of the local people, the disaster victims have all been properly resettled. The Shijiazhuang Special District Support Disaster Area Committee, in order to properly resettle the 5,000 disaster victims who are preparing to move from Wen'an County, has instructed all counties to quickly prepare housing, living utensils, and production tools for the disaster victims, to ensure that the disaster victims have housing, food, and work to do after arriving in the village.
