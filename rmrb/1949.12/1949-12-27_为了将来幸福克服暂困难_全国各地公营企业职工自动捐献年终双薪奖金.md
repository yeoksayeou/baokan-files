　　To Overcome Temporary Difficulties for Future Happiness
    Public Enterprise Workers Across the Country Voluntarily Donate Year-End Double Salary Bonuses
  　Qingdao Transportation Bank Workers write to the Military Representative saying: We only hope to eliminate the remaining bandits as soon as possible, restore and develop national construction as soon as possible, and then share the long-term happy days of the future with the people of the whole country.
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Public enterprise workers in Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Hankou, Shijiazhuang, Lanzhou, and Henan and other places warmly support the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Commission's decision on year-end double salaries and bonuses, as well as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' call, and are launching voluntary donation campaigns of double salaries and year-end bonuses. The entire workforce of the Jinan Telecommunications Bureau unanimously agreed in discussions that, given the current economic difficulties in our country, especially the severe disaster situation in this province, the government's decision on year-end double salaries is truly a great concern for the workers. Some workers said: As the Financial and Economic Commission's decision states, year-end double salaries or bonuses are the fruits of past struggles between workers and oppressors; they were obtained from the hands of adversaries. But now that workers are the masters, when the country has difficulties, they can be used to subsidize national expenditures. Therefore, some advocated not taking any at all. Others advocated taking half and donating it to disaster relief, or purchasing People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds. Eighty-one workers at the Qingdao Transportation Bank, in order to reduce the people's burden and strive for the early victory of the entire country, voluntarily wrote to request not receiving year-end double salaries or bonuses. Zhou Enpei and twelve other workers were the first to sign a letter to the Military Representative, requesting not to receive year-end double salaries or bonuses. The letter stated: "We think of the country's very difficult financial situation, the War of Liberation is not yet fully concluded, the vast industrial transportation is waiting to be restored and developed, and the peasant compatriots have already exhausted their greatest ability to bear burdens in the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the four years of the War of Liberation, and are still gloriously contributing everything; in addition, the hardships of the soldiers and revolutionary comrades at all levels are even more moving to us. And we are able to eat and dress warmly with our monthly salaries, which is much better than them, so we feel that we can do without it. We only hope that the remaining enemies will be eliminated as soon as possible, national construction will be restored as soon as possible, and developed, so that our government can overcome short-term financial difficulties, and then share the long-term happy days of the future with the people of the whole country. Based on our responsibility and love for our country, we submit this sincere request, please accept it!" After this letter was sent, sixty-nine people successively submitted letters making the same request. Those who signed up for not receiving double salaries or bonuses accounted for 92% of the total number of salaried employees in the bank.

  　Some workers requested less double pay, and some wanted to sell public bonds after receiving bonuses.
    Employees of the Tianjin Waterworks have already requested the factory to change the original additional month's salary at the end of the year to three-quarters of a month in accordance with the government's decision. Employees of the Tianjin Public Transport Administration, Dongya Tobacco Company, Tianjin Daily and other units requested to change it to three-quarters of a month's salary.
    Employees of the Hangzhou Office of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, the Postal Administration, the Telecommunications Bureau and the Zhejiang Daily in Hangzhou warmly supported the government's handling of year-end double salaries or bonuses. Postal workers also issued a statement of "Supporting the Government's Handling of Year-End Double Salaries or Bonuses." In a discussion among workers at the Telecommunications Bureau, Qian Qixing said: Now that the War of Liberation has not yet ended, and production and construction have not yet been fully restored and developed, it would be good enough if I can live my life, I don't need a year-end bonus. Pu Ruizhen said: Today, we must look at year-end bonuses with the attitude of masters. The government's finances are so difficult, how can we take bonuses again? Some employees said that they would also draw a portion of the bonus to purchase public bonds.
    A coal worker at the Hankou Locomotive Depot said: The government implements inflation-adjusted wages and inflation-adjusted savings, and life is guaranteed. It's better this year without double pay than in previous years.
    After studying the documents of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Plains Temporary People's Government on handling year-end double salaries or bonuses, the employees of the Hankou Branch of the Central China Jinghan Railway Administration automatically requested less or no year-end double salaries or bonuses. Yang Dehua, a coal worker at the Hankou Branch Locomotive Depot, although his family has many members and life is more difficult, believes that since liberation, the People's Government has implemented inflation-adjusted wages and inflation-adjusted savings, as well as various worker welfare programs, and life is guaranteed. Even if there is no double pay this year, it is better than in previous years. All employees of the No. 2 Factory of Jianghan Shipping Company unanimously agreed to reduce double salaries after discussion. Some employees, in order to take care of the factory's economic difficulties, also requested not to issue double salaries. Senior employees of the Hankou Telecommunications Bureau originally received an additional four months' salary at the end of each year, and general employees also received an additional half month to one month's salary. After discussion, everyone agreed to reduce the amount issued. In addition to warmly supporting the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, general employees of the public Jiji Hydropower Company also agreed to implement the supplementary measures of the Central Plains Temporary People's Government regarding the phased payment of final salaries and the non-payment of double salaries to cadres who were originally on the supply system. Some employees with higher salaries are also preparing to launch New Year mutual aid to help employees with lower salaries and large families to have a good year.
    China Merchants Bureau employees are willing to donate their annual awards to the country for shipbuilding, and post office employees are willing to donate their annual awards to build people's post offices.
    All cadres and students of the China Merchants Bureau Hankou Branch Training Class, after receiving the call from the employees of the China Merchants Bureau Changsha Branch not to receive year-end double salaries, immediately gathered to discuss and unanimously decided to donate the year-end bonus to the country to build ships, so as to develop the people's shipping industry.
    All employees of the Shijiazhuang Electric Lamp Company wrote to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions saying: We warmly support and implement this decision of the government. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, all employees understand that in order to build a new society of eternal happiness in the future, we must endure and overcome temporary difficulties, further improve production and support the War of Liberation. Finally, they expressed that they would complete the third production competition task as a gift to Chairman Mao and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    Employees of the Lanzhou Northwest Textile Factory, Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory, and Xi'an Automobile Maintenance Factory of the Shaanxi Provincial Highway Bureau and other units also expressed their support for the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, and believed that helping the government overcome temporary financial difficulties is the responsibility of the working class and the people of the whole country.
    The Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on the 20th, calling on workers throughout the province to resolutely support the government's call. After studying the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' letter to workers, workers and staff of the Henan Provincial Postal Administration, in addition to expressing their support, workers of the second and third branches also wrote to the trade union separately in their own names, proposing to donate all of their annual awards to the government for the construction of the people's postal service. At the general meeting of all employees, many workers volunteered to sign up to donate funds. Many comrades also solemnly stamped their names on their written names. The old worker Huo Shangwen wrote on the note: Regarding the issue of issuing annual awards, because the country is in financial difficulty and the remaining bandits have not been eliminated, and the people are living in difficulty, in order to take into account future welfare, sacrifice the present, and I am willing to give up the bonus.

　　为了将来幸福克服暂困难
    全国各地公营企业职工自动捐献年终双薪奖金
  　青市交通银行职工上书军代表说：我们只希望早日肃清残匪，早日恢复和发展国家建设，再与全国人民共同享受将来长远的幸福日子。
    【本报讯】济南、青岛、天津、杭州、汉口、石家庄、兰州及河南等地公营企业职工，热烈拥护中央人民政府财经委员会关于年终双薪、奖金的决定和全国总工会的号召，并展开自动捐献双薪、年奖运动。济南电讯局市话乎全体工人，在讨论中一致认为，在目前我国经济这样困难，尤其本省灾情这样严重的情况下，政府对年终双薪作出这样决定，真是对工人太关心了。有的工人说：正如财经委员会决定占所说，年终双薪或奖金是过去工人和压迫者斗争得来的果实，那是得自敌对者手里的东西；可是工人现在做了主人，国家有了困难，可以拿他贴补国家的开支。因此主张全部不要。有的工人则主张领下后一半捐出求灾，其作购买人民胜利折实公债。青岛市交通银行八十一个职工，为了减轻人民负担，争取全国早日胜利，自动上书不领年终双薪或奖金。周恩沛等十二位职工，首先签名上书军代表，请求不领年终双薪或奖金。信上说：“我们想到国家财政非常困难，解放战争尚未全部结束，广大工业交通正待恢复发展，而农民同胞在八年抗日战争中及四年解放战争中，早了尽了最大的负担能力，一直到现在，还光荣地供献一切；另外，战士们及各级革命同志的艰苦，更使我们感动。而我们每月薪给所得却能衣温食饱，比他们好得多，觉得可以不领。我们只希望将残敌早日肃清，国家建设早日恢复，并发展起来，使我们政府能渡过短期间的财政困难，再与全国人民共同享受将来长远的幸福日子。基于我们对自己国家的责任与热爱，提出这个诚挚的请示，请你接受吧！”该信发出后，相继有六十九人上书作同样要求。全行签名不领双薪或奖金的，占全行薪给制职工的百分之九十二。
  　有的工人要求少发双薪，有的领了奖金要卖公债。
    天津市自来水厂职工已经要求厂方按照政府决定将原来年终加发一个月的薪金改为关个月。天津市公共汽车管理处、东亚烟草公司、天津日报社等各单位职工，则要求改为增发一个月薪金的四分之三。
    杭州市上海铁路局杭州办事处、邮政管理局、电讯局及浙江日报职工，热烈拥护政府处理年终双薪或奖金办法。邮政工人还发表了“拥护政府处理年终双薪或奖金办法”声明书。电讯局工人在讨论中，钱启型说：现在解放战争尚未结束，生产建设尚未全部恢复和发展起来，我的生活能过下去就好了，不要年终奖金。浦瑞珍说：我们今天要以主人翁的态度来看年终奖金，政府财政这样困难，我们怎能再拿奖金呢。有些职工表示，领到奖金也要抽一部购买公债。
    汉口机务段煤工说：政府实行折实工薪、折实储蓄，生活有了保障，今年过年不发双薪，也比往年强。
    华中京汉铁路管理局汉口分局的职工们，在学习中央财政经济委员会、中华全国总工会和中原临时人民政府关于处理年终双薪或奖金办法的文件后，自动要求少发和不发年终双薪或奖金。汉口分局机务段煤工杨德华，虽然因为家庭人口众多，生活较为困难，但他认为解放以后人民政府实行折实工薪和折实储蓄，以及举办各种工人福利事业，生活有了保障，今年过年即使不发双薪，也比往年强。江汉船舶公司第二工厂全体职工，经过讨论以后，一致同意少发双薪。有些职工为照顾工厂的经济困难，且要求不发双薪。汉口电信局的高级职员，原来每年年终增发薪金四个月，一般职工也加发薪金半个月至一个月。经过讨论以后，大家同意少发。公营既济水电公司的一般职工，除了热烈拥护中央财政经济委员会的决定之外，并同意执行中原临时人民政府关于所终薪金分期发给和原供给制干部不发双薪的补充办法。一部分薪金较高的职工，还准备发起新年互助，帮助薪金较低而家庭人口众多的职工，也能过一个好年。
    招商局职工愿把年奖献给国家造船，邮局职工愿把年奖献出建设人民邮政。
    汉口招商局职工轮训班的全体干部、学员，在接到招商局长沙分局职工不领年终双薪的号召以后，立时集会讨论，一致决议将年终奖金献给国家建造船只，以发展人民的航运事业。
    石家庄电灯公司全体职工写信给全国总工会说：我们热烈拥护并执行政府这个决定，全体职工在毛主席领导下，懂得了为建设将来永远幸福的新社会，必须忍受和克服暂的困难，进一步搞好生产，支援解放战争。最后并表示要以完成第三次生产竞赛任务，作为对毛主席及全总的献礼。
    兰州西北纺织厂、兰州汽车修理厂和陕西省公路局西安汽车保养厂等单位的职工，对中央财政经济委员会的决定，也纷纷表示拥护，并认为帮助政府克服一时的财政困难，是工人阶级和全国人民应尽的职责。
    河南省总工会已于二十日发出通知，号召全省工人坚决拥护政府号召。河南省邮政管理局工人和职员们，在学习全总告工人书后，除表示拥护外，二、三支局职工，并分别联名给工会写信，提出愿意把他们应得的年奖，全部献给政府，作为建设人民邮政事业之用。在全体职工大会上，许多工人纷纷自动写条子报名捐献资金。好些同志还郑重地在自己写的名字上盖了图章。老工人霍尚文在条子上写道：为发年奖一事，因国家财政困难而残匪尚未肃清，人民生活困难，为顾及以后福利，牺牲现在，情愿将奖金不要。
