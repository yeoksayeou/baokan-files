Political Economy Tutorial Introduction (55)
    The Object and Tasks of Political Economy and its Characteristics
    Section 3: The Class Character, Partisanship, and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy

    Marx and Engels had already provided an exceptionally profound, undisguised, and exceptionally vivid depiction of the bourgeoisie's selfish class nature: "The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.' It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers. The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation." (Marx and Engels, The Communist Manifesto). This selfish class nature of the bourgeoisie determines the class character and narrowness of bourgeois scientific theories, and also determines the narrow class character of bourgeois political economy, and is fully manifested in economics.

    The bourgeoisie is most sensitive to its own class interests.

    All the words and actions of the bourgeoisie, as well as the various policies and measures of the bourgeois government representing the interests of the bourgeoisie, are closely related to the class interests of the bourgeoisie itself, and are a reflection and manifestation of the bourgeoisie's extremely selfish class interests. All social and economic changes, and the promulgation and impact of any economic policy or economic decree, in bourgeois society, directly reflect and represent the interests and desires of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is most sensitive to these. This is also the case even in a new democratic society. Therefore, people's economic demands, economic propositions, and economic theories are the most effective and accurate barometers for measuring and testing people's class feelings, class character, and the class dynamics and class relations of society.

    Bourgeois political economy is a reflection of the bourgeoisie's immediate interests.

    The analysis of the capitalist socio-economy in bourgeois political economy is a reflection of the bourgeoisie's own interests. Their doctrines, theories, and opinions directly represent and reflect the interests of the bourgeoisie, and they also have a class nature. Bourgeois political economists are the embodiment of these bourgeois interests, and they are spokespersons and defenders of the capitalist wage slavery system. Therefore, bourgeois political economy only represents the class interests of a minority of the bourgeoisie.

    Bourgeois political economists conceal and obscure the essence of their class character and partisanship.

    Because the bourgeoisie must exploit the proletariat and oppress the proletariat in order to exist and develop, they dare not expose the economic essence of the bourgeoisie or capitalism. Based on their own class interests, they try every means to cover up their essence of exploitation, using all methods to cover up, conceal, obliterate, and deny its class character and partisanship, and shamelessly depict their doctrines and theories as non-class and "super"-class in order to conceal their class character and partisanship, hoping to deceive and paralyze the exploited and oppressed proletariat and the masses of the people. They are good at proclaiming that they represent the entire nation, that they are representatives of the masses of the people, that they are a reflection of human interests, and that they are the gospel and savior for saving the people. They often call their political economy "national economics" and "social economics." Finally, in the era of the general crisis of capitalism and in recent years, there have been so-called "totalitarian" and "cosmopolitan" economics. Bourgeois political economists use these terms to embellish themselves as representatives of the nation or society, to explain that the interests they represent are those of the entire society and represent the interests of the world. But in fact, the society they call society is only the society ruled by the bourgeoisie; the people they call the people are only the minority of the bourgeoisie themselves, and the majority of the people under their rule have no share; the interests they represent are not the interests of the real people, but only the interests of the minority bourgeoisie. The so-called totalitarianism advocated by fascists only represents the interests of the German and Italian fascists and financial oligarchs represented by Hitler and Mussolini. The "cosmopolitanism" advocated by Truman, Marshall, and others in the United States is nothing more than representing the interests of the sixty financial groups in the United States and their two-party government's fierce world aggression. Therefore, their so-called political economy is nothing more than a tool to support the capitalist system and maintain the rule of the bourgeoisie. Even if bourgeois political economists sometimes admit in theory that there are classes in society, they all express that they are above classes, appearing as intermediaries or in a high and super-class posture. But in fact, they fully represent the economic interests of the bourgeoisie, and everywhere defend and preach for the interests of the bourgeoisie, but they are unwilling to look at or never take care of the interests of the working class and working people who truly account for the majority of the people or the nation. At most, when the masses of the people rise up to resist, they put forward some reformist methods to deceive, paralyze, and disintegrate the working class and the masses of the people. Therefore, these bourgeois political economists, according to Lenin, are nothing more than "'stewards' under the bourgeoisie. Their theories generally 'cannot be believed in a single word.'"

    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    资产阶级自私自利的阶级本性，马克思恩格斯也早有异常深刻露骨的异常形象化的刻划：“资产阶级，到处在它得到了统治的一切地方，破坏了封建的、家长制的、淳朴的关系，它无情地撕了那些把人们束缚于‘天然尊长’的复杂的封建网络，它使人与人之间除了赤条条的利害关系与冷酷的‘现金交易’之外，再没有别的什么关系了。它把宗教的虔诚，勇士的热忱，俗人的多愁善感等等庄严的激发沉没在利已主义打算的水天之中。它把人的个人才能变成了交换价值，它用一种无良心的贸易自由去代替了无数特许的和不可废弃的自由。一句话，它用公开的、无耻的、直接的、露骨的剥削去代替了用宗教与政治的幻想掩盖着的剥削。资产阶级取消了以前认为可敬的、被诚惶诚恐地崇拜的一切行为的神圣的威严。它把医生、律师、牧师、诗人、科学家变成自己出钱雇佣的劳动者。资产阶级扯掉了家庭关系的动人的——多情的纱幕，并使之变成纯粹的金钱关系。”（马克思恩格斯合著共产党宣言）资产阶级这种自私自利的阶级本性，决定着资产阶级科学理论的阶级性与偏狭性，同时也决定着资产阶级政治经济学的狭隘的阶级性，并充分地表现在经济学中。
    资产阶级对于自己的阶级利益是最敏感的
    资产阶级的一切言论行动，以及代表资产阶级利益的资产阶级政府的各种政策措施，都是与资产阶级本身的阶级利益息息相关，血肉相连，作为资产阶级极端自私自利的阶级利益的反映表现着的。而一切社会经济上的变动，任何经济政策经济法令的颁布与影响，在资产阶级社会里，无不直接反映着代表着资产阶级的利益与利欲，资产阶级对于这些是最敏感的，这种情况，即使是新民主主义社会里也是如此；因此，人们的经济要求经济主张经济学说，是测量与检定人们的阶级感情、阶级性与社会的阶级动态、阶级关系最灵验最准确的风雨表。
    资产阶级政治经济学就是资产阶级切身利害的反映
    资产阶级政治经济学，对资本主义社会经济的分析，就是资产阶级的切身利害的反映，他们的学说，理论，意见都是直接代表着反映着资产阶级的利益，也都是有阶级性的。资产阶级政治经济学者就是这种资产阶级利害的体现者，他们是资本主义雇佣奴隶制度的代言人、辩护者。因此资产阶级政治经济学只是代表资产阶级少数人的阶级利益的。
    资产阶级政治经济学者掩盖隐蔽其阶级性党派性的实质
    由于资产阶级必须剥削无产阶级，必须压迫无产阶级才能存在和发展，因此它们也就不敢暴露资产阶级或资本主义这一经济的实质，并基于他们自身的阶级利害出发，相反地千方百计的来掩盖它们剥削的实质，用尽一切方法来掩盖、隐蔽、抹煞、否认它的阶级性与党派性，并卑鄙无耻地描绘它们的学说理论是非阶级的是“超”阶级的来掩蔽他们的阶级性与党派性，想借以蒙蔽、欺骗、麻醉受剥削受压迫的无产阶级与人民大众。它们善于宣扬他们是代表全体国民的，是人民大众的代表，是人类利益的反映，是解救人民的福音和救星，经常把他们的政治经济学叫做“国民经济学”、“社会经济学”，最后至资本主义总危机时代与最近年代又有所谓“全体主义”所谓“世界主义”经济学出现。资产阶级政治经济学者，他们用这些名词来粉饰他们是国民或社会的代表，来说明他们代表的利益是全体社会的，是代表世界利益的。但是实际上，它们所谓的社会，只是资产阶级统治的社会；它们所谓的国民，也只是少数资产阶级本身，与它们统治下的大多数国民是没有份儿的；它们所代表的利益，也并不是真正人民的利益，只是少数资产阶级的利益。法西斯主义者所谓全体主义所代表的也只是希特勒墨索里尼所代表的德意法西斯与金融寡头的利益。美国杜鲁门马歇尔等所宣扬的“世界主义”，也无非是代表美国六十家财阀与它们的两党政府凶恶的世界侵略主义的利益而已。所以他们所谓的政治经济学无非是拥护资本主义制度维护资产阶级统治的工具。即使资产阶级政治经济学者在理论上有时也承认社会上有阶级的存在，但它们都表示自己是超乎阶级之上，以中间者面目或高高在上超阶级的姿态出现，而实际上，它们却十足地代表着资产阶级的经济利益，到处在为资产阶级的利益辩护与说教，而对于真正占人民或国民大多数的工人阶级与劳动人民的利益，却是不愿顾盼也从不照顾的，最多当人民大众起来反抗的时候提出一些改良主义的办法来欺骗麻痹并瓦解工人阶级与人民大众。所以这种资产阶级的政治经济学者，照列宁的说法无非都是“资产阶级手下的‘管事’罢了。他们的理论一般“是一句话也不可以相信的。”
