    Stalin Leads the World's People to Form a Powerful Anti-War Bulwark
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st] Soviet expert Stugalev delivered a speech at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's General Assembly celebrating Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday, which stated in brief:

    All the people of the Soviet Union are sincerely delighted that the great, now free, Chinese people are celebrating the 70th birthday of the great leader of the Soviet people, the great activist of our heroic era, and the inspirer and leader of the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, this event of extraordinary historical significance, with such kindness, enthusiasm, and friendship.

    Comrade Stalin is an extraordinary activist, the highest type of activist, an activist of all oppressed classes, working people, and the proletariat. He unreservedly dedicated all his inexhaustible energy, all his scientific theoretical genius, and all his unsurpassable organizational talent to the proletariat.

    Comrades Lenin and Stalin, for the first time in human history, created a state of working people, a state of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals, in which there is neither social oppression nor national oppression, and in which the working people of about sixty nationalities and ethnic groups live together in genuine friendship.

    In 1941, Hitler's Germany perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, which was a difficult period for us. However, as you know, under the leadership of our far-sighted, astute, and genius leader and outstanding commander, Comrade Stalin, we crushed the German fascist bandits.

    Now, in the Anglo-American countries, they are again trying to replay the invasion of the Soviet Union, the country of working people, by the German and Japanese fascists. The organizers of the new war should note that in the same camp as the Soviet Union are the new democratic countries, and the great People's Republic of China. Together with the Soviet Union, under the inspiration and leadership of our beloved teacher and leader, Comrade Stalin, a powerful anti-war bulwark is being created, represented by hundreds of millions of fighters from among all advanced elements of all countries, fighting for peace, for democracy, and for socialism.

    The greatest Marxist-Leninist theorist, Comrade Stalin, with the brilliance of his genius, illuminates the path for the working people of all countries to a better future, to the path of communism.

    Under the genius leadership of Comrade Stalin, all the people of the Soviet Union are advancing towards the victory of communism.

    Glory to the great successor of Lenin's cause—Stalin!

    Long live world peace!

    Long live the friendship between the great Soviet people and the great Chinese people!

    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!

    We wish our dear leader, our great and wise teacher, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, a long and happy life for the well-being and happiness of mankind.

　　苏联专家斯都格略夫演说         
    斯大林领导世界人民组成了强大反战壁垒
    【新华社北京二十一日电】苏联专家斯都格略夫在中苏友好协会总会庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰大会上发表演说，略称：
    全苏联人民对伟大的从今以后是自由的中国人民如此好如此热烈如此友爱地庆祝苏联人民的伟大领袖、我们英雄时代的伟大活动家、强大的和平民主和社会主义阵营底鼓舞者和领袖约瑟夫·维赛里昂维奇·斯大林的七十寿辰，这一具有非凡历史意义的事件，衷心地感到欢欣。
    斯大林同志是非凡的活动家，是最高类型的活动家，是各被压迫阶级、劳动人民、无产阶级的活动家。他毫不保留地把自己全部取之不竭的精力，把自己全部科学的理论的天才，把自己全部不可窬越的组织才干，贡献给了无产阶级。
    列宁同志和斯大林同志，在人类历史上第一次创立了劳动人民的国家、工人农民和劳动知识分子的国家，在这个国家里，既没有社会压迫，也没有民族压迫，约六十个民族和民族集团的劳动人民真诚友好地共处一堂。
    一九四一年，希特勒德国背信弃义进攻苏联，这对于我们是一个艰苦的时期。但是，如你们所知道的，我们在我们有远见的精明的天才领袖和卓越统帅斯大林同志领导下，粉碎了德国法西斯匪徒。
    现在，在英美国家里，又在极力准备重演德日法西斯向苏联、向劳动人民国家的进军。新战争的组织者应当注意到，同苏联在一个阵营的有各新民主主义国家，有伟大的中华人民共和国，同苏联一道，在我们亲爱的导师和领袖斯大林同志的鼓舞领导下，正造成一座由各国一切先进分子中数万万战士所代表的为和平、为民主、为社会主义而斗争的强大的反战壁垒。
    最伟大的马列主义理论家斯大林同志以自己天才的光辉，给各国劳动人民照耀着走向更美好的未来的道路，走向共产主义的道路。
    在斯大林同志的天才领导下，全苏联人民向共产主义的胜利迈进。
    光荣归于列宁事业的伟大继承者——斯大林。
    全世界和平万岁！
    伟大苏联人民和伟大中国人民友好万岁！
    中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！
    祝我们亲爱的领袖，我们伟大英明的导师约瑟夫·维赛里昂维奇·斯大林为人类的福祉和幸福万寿无疆。
