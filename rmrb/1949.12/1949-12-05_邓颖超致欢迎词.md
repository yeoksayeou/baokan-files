Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 4th: The full text of the welcome speech by Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation: Dear Madame Vaillant-Couturier, representatives from various countries, guests from various countries:

　　On behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and all members of the International Preparatory Committee for the Asian Women's Representative Conference, I warmly welcome Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, who has come to Beijing to guide the Asian Women's Representative Conference, as well as the representatives and guests from various countries attending the conference. I extend sisterly greetings to all of you!

　　The recent meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Moscow has once again called on democratic women around the world to further expand and strengthen the struggle for peace and democracy. This call has given everyone new strength.

　　In order for women from Asian countries to exchange experiences in struggle, help each other, and further advance the struggle of oppressed women in Asia for national liberation and people's democracy, and to more closely link the struggle of Asian women with the struggle of women and people around the world for lasting world peace and people's democracy, the Women's International Democratic Federation decided to convene the Asian Women's Representative Conference. We warmly support this decision. Our All-China Democratic Women's Federation warmly welcomes the holding of this conference in China. We will do everything in our power to make this conference a success.

　　Under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Asian women have fought side by side in the struggle against imperialist wars of aggression and for national independence and people's democracy. In the past, due to the obstruction of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, we had no opportunity to gather together and exchange experiences in struggle. Today, thanks to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Asian Women's Representative Conference can be successfully convened in Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people. Our long-awaited international sisters can gather together to freely hold meetings, discuss, and decide on the future direction and tasks of the Asian women's struggle. We believe that the convening of this conference will further strengthen the unity of Asian women, more closely coordinate with the struggle of oppressed nations and people for democracy in Asia, and work together with peace-loving sisters around the world to defend lasting world peace and oppose wars of aggression.

　　We believe that the national liberation struggles and women's liberation movements in Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries will surely succeed, and final victory will surely be ours.

　　Dear sisters! Let us hold our hands tightly and wish the Asian Women's Representative Conference a success.

　　Long live the great unity of Asian women!

　　Long live the Women's International Democratic Federation!

    【新华社北京四日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超欢迎词全文：亲爱的古久里夫人、各国代表、各国来宾：
    我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会和亚洲妇女代表会议国际筹委会的全体委员，热烈欢迎来京指导亚洲妇女代表会议的国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人，和出席会议的各国代表，以及各国来宾，并向各位致姊妹的敬礼！
    最近在莫斯科举行的国际民主妇联理事会又号召全世界民主妇女进一步扩大与加强和平与民主的斗争。这个号召使大家获得新的力量。
    为了使亚洲各国妇女能够交换斗争经验，互相帮助，使亚洲被压迫妇女为民族解放和人民民主的斗争更向前推进一步，并且使亚洲妇女的斗争和全世界妇女和人民的为世界持久和平与人民民主的斗争更加密切地联系起来，国际民主妇联决定召开亚洲妇女代表会议，我们热烈拥护这个决定。我们中华全国民主妇联热烈欢迎这个大会在中国举行，我们要尽一切的力量把这个会议开好。
    亚洲妇女在国际民主妇联的领导下，在反对帝国主义的侵略战争，和为民族独立，为人民民主的斗争中，曾经并肩携手，共同奋斗。过去由于帝国主义及各国反动派的阻挠，我们没有机会相聚一堂，彼此交换斗争的经验。今天，由于中国人民革命的伟大胜利，使亚洲妇女代表会议，可以顺利地在中国人民的首都——北京召开，我们渴望很久的国际姊妹们，能够聚首一堂自由开会讨论，并且决定今后亚洲妇女斗争的方针和任务。我们相信由于这次会议的召开，将更加加强亚洲妇女的团结，更加密切地配合亚洲被压迫民族和人民民主的斗争，并和全世界爱好和平的姊妹们，为保卫全世界持久和平，反对侵略战争而共同努力。
    我们相信亚洲各殖民地半殖民地国家的民族解放斗争与妇女解放运动，必定成功，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    亲爱的姊妹们！让我们紧紧地握起手来，预祝亚洲妇女代表会议的成功。
    亚洲妇女大团结万岁！
    国际民主妇联万岁！
