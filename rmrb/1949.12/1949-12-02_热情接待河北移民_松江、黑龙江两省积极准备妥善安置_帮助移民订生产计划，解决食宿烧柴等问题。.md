　　Warmly Receive Hebei Immigrants: Songjiang and Heilongjiang Provinces Actively Prepare for Proper Resettlement
　　Helping immigrants formulate production plans and solve problems such as food, lodging, and firewood.
　　[Our Newspaper] Seven thousand three hundred disaster victims from Hebei Province who were moved to Songjiang Province in the Northeast had all arrived by the end of November. The Songjiang Provincial People's Government has decided to allocate this group of immigrants to counties such as Huanan, Mishan, Jixian, and Yanshou. After receiving the notice from the provincial government, the counties are actively preparing houses and carts to welcome them, and preparing leather and cotton clothing to protect the elderly, weak, and women from the cold. Farmers in Yanshou are preparing to help each immigrant family with ten days' worth of firewood after they arrive in the village; Mishan is preparing to hold a large meeting to introduce local agricultural conditions. Preliminary production plans have been made for the immigrants in various places. Huanan plans to organize immigrants to burn charcoal, log, and mine gold, while Yanshou plans to arrange for immigrant children to attend school. The Northeast People's Government has allocated 5,840 tons of grain as loans to solve the immigrants' production tools and some food, so that they can quickly engage in production. In order to take care of the immigrants' difficulties with food and lodging en route, in addition to the above four counties being responsible for making specific arrangements and preparing for reception and resettlement work, the provincial government has also instructed Shuangcheng, Shangzhi, Linkou, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi and other counties and cities to establish five immigrant supply stations to be specifically responsible for coordinating and assisting the immigrants with food and lodging supplies when they pass through these areas on their way to their respective destinations. At present, all counties and cities are doing their best to mobilize a large number of people to actively prepare and provide support. After the immigrants arrive, their lives can be immediately settled, enabling them to be well integrated into the great wave of agricultural production in the future.
　　[Another News] In mid-November, the Northeast People's Government decided to move 10,000 disaster victims from Hebei Province to Heilongjiang Province. In order to take care of the food and lodging problems of the immigrant masses, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government has established immigrant stations in Harbin, Qiqihar, Suihua, and Tao'an, and established an immigrant committee, which decided to allocate the immigrants to Nehe, Keshan, Hailun, Dedu, Qing'an, Suiling, Nenjiang, Gannan, and Chahayang Farm.
　　In order to help immigrants develop production, the provincial government also allocated 5,000 tons of interest-free grain loans. At the same time, the provincial government instructed the counties accepting immigrants to immediately settle them in places with good land, good mass foundations, and wealth, and to concentrate them, not disperse them. Preparations are also being made to help immigrants build houses next year. After receiving the immigrant notice from the district government, Xuetian Village, No. 3 District, Nehe County, established an immigrant resettlement committee on November 12, divided into a condolence group, a preparation group, and a resettlement group, to help immigrants quickly settle down.
