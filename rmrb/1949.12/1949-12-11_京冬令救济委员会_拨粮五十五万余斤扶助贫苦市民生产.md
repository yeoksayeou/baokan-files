　　Beijing Winter Relief Committee
  　Allocates Over 550,000 Jin of Grain
    To Support Poor Citizens' Production
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Winter Relief Committee was formally established on November 15th. In the past twenty-odd days, it has completed preliminary investigation and key re-examination work. The total relief grain and production subsidy grain, amounting to 558,000 jin of millet, has been distributed to various districts inside and outside the city, and will be distributed on a priority basis by the district public offices (or district governments) in the coming days. 16,030 items of winter clothing will also be distributed soon.

    The Winter Relief Committee is jointly composed of six departments: the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Municipal Government Suburban Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Women's Federation. The task of the committee is to provide relief to refugees who have been displaced to this city due to floods, and to unemployed workers and impoverished citizens who have suffered long-term exploitation and oppression by the reactionary government, and to help them engage in production, under the principle of comforting the displaced and supporting the poor. For widowers, widows, orphans, and childless elderly who lack clothing and food, after verification by the district public office and the public security bureau派出所, in conjunction with production self-help methods, relief grain or production subsidy grain will be issued on a priority basis according to different levels, and winter clothing will also be issued as appropriate. Of the grain source, 450,000 jin were allocated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, and the remaining 108,000 jin and 16,030 items of winter clothing were allocated by the Beijing All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee. The allocation of grain to each district is determined based on specific conditions such as the size of the district, the population, and the prosperity of industry and commerce: (1) The thirteen districts of the urban area have a total of 450,000 jin of millet: District 1 has 38,000 jin; District 2 has 33,000 jin; District 3 has 55,000 jin; District 4 has 38,000 jin; District 5 has 44,000 jin; District 6 has 26,000 jin; District 7 has 20,000 jin; District 8 has 26,000 jin; District 9 has 33,000 jin; District 10 has 44,000 jin; District 11 has 45,000 jin; District 12 has 48,000 jin. (2) The eight suburban districts have a total of 108,000 jin of millet: District 13 has 17,000 jin; District 14 has 18,000 jin; District 15 has 15,000 jin; District 16 has 10,000 jin; District 17 has 15,000 jin; District 18 has 15,000 jin; District 19 has 10,000 jin; District 20 has 8,000 jin. The distribution of winter clothing is 8,015 items for the twelve districts in the urban area and 8,015 items for the eight districts in the suburbs. Depending on the circumstances, each person receiving relief can receive between 25 and 45 jin of relief grain or production subsidy grain.
