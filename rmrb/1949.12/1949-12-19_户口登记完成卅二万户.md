　　Household Registration Completed for 320,000 Households
    ★As of the 14th of this month, the Beijing Public Security Bureau's work to replace household registration booklets throughout the city has been completed for over 320,000 households in the inner city and 20 suburban district bureaus, accounting for 73% of the city's total households. Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government announced in November the abolition of the reactionary household registration regulations left over by the Kuomintang bandit gang, and the cancellation of 15 types of household registration forms and their cumbersome procedures, establishing a new and simplified household registration system, it has not only contributed to the various construction projects in Beijing, but also further consolidated the revolutionary order of the people's capital.

　　户口登记完成卅二万户　
    ★京市公安局更换全市户口簿工作，截至本月十四日止，城内及郊区二十个分局已完成三十二万余户，占全市总户数的百分之七十三。该局自十一月京市人民政府宣布废除国民党匪帮遗留下的反动户口规章，取消了十五种户口表册及其繁锁手续，建立了手续简便的新户口制度，不但有助于京市的各项建设，同时进一步巩固了人民首都的革命秩序。
