　　For the Happiness and Joy of All Mankind
　　Wishing Stalin Health and Longevity
　　A Toast to Comrade Stalin! A Toast to the Bolshevik Party! A Toast to the Soviet People and the Soviet Government! A Toast to the Soviet Armed Forces!
　　Shvernik addressed the guests, saying: Comrades! I propose that we first drink a toast to the great leader of the Soviet people and the working people of the world, the inspirer and organizer of the victory of communism—our dear Comrade Stalin. We wish Comrade Stalin health and longevity for the happiness and joy of all mankind! This was met with stormy applause. The entire audience rose, and the orchestra played a resounding melody.
　　Shvernik then suggested a toast to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the Bolshevik Party that led the working class to the victory of the proletarian dictatorship, ensured the construction of a socialist society in the Soviet Union, and led the Soviet people toward the victory of communism.
　　Shvernik raised his glass to the Soviet people, who, under communist leadership, won victory over fascism and led all progressive humanity in an unremitting struggle against the instigators of new wars, for peace among nations, and for democracy and socialism.
　　Shvernik proposed a toast to the Soviet socialist state, to the solid friendship of the Soviet nations, and to the Soviet government!
　　Stormy applause resounded throughout the hall.
　　Shvernik proposed a toast to the Soviet Armed Forces, who, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, won a brilliant victory in the Great Patriotic War, to the Soviet Army defending the freedom and independence of the Soviet motherland, and to the outstanding marshals, generals, officers, and soldiers of the Army and Navy. The guests warmly hailed the glorious Soviet combatants, who were nurtured by the great Stalin and traversed a glorious path in the Great Patriotic War.

  　祝斯大林健康而长寿
    为斯大林同志干杯！为布尔什维克党干杯！为苏联人民和苏维埃政府干杯！为苏联武装部队干杯！
    什维尔尼克向宾客们致辞说：同志们！我提议首先为苏联人民及全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖、为共产主义胜利的鼓舞者与组织者——我们亲爱的斯大林同志干杯。我们敬祝斯大林同志为了全体人类的幸福与欢乐而健康与长寿！当场博得了暴风雨般的掌声。全场起立，乐队奏乐声澈响全场。
    什维尔尼克继即建议为苏联共产党中央委员会、为领导了工人阶级取得无产阶级专政胜利，为确保了在苏联建设社会主义社会并领导着苏联人民走向共产主义胜利的布尔什维克党干杯。
    什维尔尼克举杯为苏联人民欢饮，他们在共产主义领导之下赢得了对法西斯的胜利，并领导全体进步人类进行反对新战争挑拨者，争取各民族间和平、争取民主与社会主义的不卷斗争。
    什维尔尼克建议为苏维埃社会主义国家、为苏联各民族坚固的友谊、为苏维埃政府干杯！
    暴风雨般的掌声澈响全场。
    什维尔尼克提议为斯大林同志领导下，在伟大爱国战争中赢得辉煌胜利的苏联武装部队，为捍卫苏维埃祖国之自由与独立的苏军、为陆海军杰出的元帅们、将军们、军官和士兵们干杯。来宾们热烈地欢呼光荣的苏维埃战斗人员，他们由伟大的斯大林培育起来，并且在伟大的爱国战争中经历了光荣的道路。
