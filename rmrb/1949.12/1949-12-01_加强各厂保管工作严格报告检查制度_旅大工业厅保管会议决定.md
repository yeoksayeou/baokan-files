　　Strengthening Storage Work in Factories and Strictly Enforcing Reporting and Inspection Systems
  　Decision of the Lüda Industrial Bureau Storage Meeting
    [Report from this newspaper] The Lüda Industrial Bureau's Supply and Marketing Department convened a meeting of storage personnel from various factories on the 2nd of this month to strengthen storage work in its affiliated factories. The meeting first reviewed the shortcomings in past storage work: 1. Regarding materials: There was no reporting system for the main raw material inventory of factories, preventing the allocation departments from proactively allocating and purchasing. Often, the factory would only request materials after they were used up, leading to delays in purchasing and impacting production. 2. Regarding products: Although a daily and monthly reporting system had been established in the past, factories rarely submitted reports in a timely manner. For example, with cloth and knitwear, the quantity of production and inventory were unknown due to the lack of timely reports. During withdrawals, the estimated quantities were often inaccurate, leading to wasted transportation capacity when estimated too high and affecting distribution and causing accumulation in warehouses when estimated too low. In addition, there was a lack of strict inspection of storage, resulting in frequent discrepancies in the quantities received and issued. To overcome these shortcomings, the meeting, based on the above situation, stipulated specific improvement measures: ① Regarding the issue of material inventory: It was decided to establish a monthly raw material inventory report. The Supply and Marketing Department will specify the types of materials to facilitate planned procurement. ② Regarding the method of inspecting materials delivered to factories: The principle was established that materials that were completely incompatible with the required specifications or unusable due to spoilage could be returned to the Supply and Marketing Department. Others, such as those of lower quality or slightly different shapes but capable of being substituted, would be allowed to be used with a reduced quantity or price to avoid accumulation or waste of funds. ③ Regarding the daily and monthly reporting of products, it was decided to strengthen the system of reporting on time. ④ Regarding the inspection of the quantities received and issued: Storage personnel should strengthen their sense of responsibility. For products entering the warehouse on-site, they should not assume that there will be no mistakes because it is their own factory, only checking the large numbers and not the small numbers. From now on, storage personnel are required to carefully count when receiving goods and carefully explain when issuing goods, clarifying responsibilities. The inspection of product specifications should also be strictly enforced, and good and bad should not be mixed together. If the Supply and Marketing Department discovers any non-compliant or damaged items in the future, they should be calculated at a reduced quantity or price, and the loss will be borne by the factory.

　　加强各厂保管工作严格报告检查制度
  　旅大工业厅保管会议决定
    【本报讯】旅大工业厅为加强所属各工厂保管工作，供销处于本月二日召集各厂保管人员会议。会上首先检讨了过去保管工作中存在的缺点：一、材料方面：工厂库存主要原材料没有规定报告制度，使调剂部门不能主动的调拨与采购，及至材料用完，工厂提出后，再行采购，往往影响生产。二、产品方面：过去虽然建立日报及月报制，但各厂很少及时呈报。如布及针织品，因为没有及时呈报，不知产量及库存多少，在提货时估计数量，常有估多了没有货浪费车力，估少了则影响分配而积于仓库的现象。此外保管缺乏严格检查，在收发数量中经常有多或少的现象。为了克服这些缺点，会议根据上述情况，规定出具体改进办法：①关于材料库存问题：决定建立原材料库存月报，由供销处规定材料种类，以便有计划布置采购；②材料发到工厂的检查方法：原则确定除与所需完全不符规格或糜烂不能使用者，准予退回供销处，其他如品质低，形状略差但能代用者，准予折合数量减低价格使用之，以免积压或浪费资金；③关于产品的日报月报，决定加强按时报告制度；④检查收发数量方面：保管人员，应加强工作责任心，现场入库的产品，不要以为是自己工厂的不会出错，只点大数，不查小数。此后要求保管人员在收货时，要仔细点收，发货时要仔细交待，明确责任。产品规格的检查，也应严格执行，不应好坏混在一起，如今后供销处检查出有不合规格或污损等现象，应折量或低价计算，损失由工厂负责。
