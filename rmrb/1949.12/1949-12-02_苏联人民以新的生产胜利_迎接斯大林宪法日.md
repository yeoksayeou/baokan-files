Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st — TASS Moscow reports: December 5th is Stalin Constitution Day, and the Soviet people are using new production victories to greet this holiday.

　　In Moscow, many enterprises that had guaranteed to complete their Five-Year Plan by December 5th have already fulfilled their promises. Dozens of production departments at the Stalin Automobile Factory have completed their annual quotas. Employees of the tool manufacturing plant completed the production volume of the Five-Year Plan a few days ago. Employees of the Clara Zetkin Garment Factory have completed the entire quota for five years and are now producing products from the 1951 plan.

　　In Magnitogorsk (on the western side of the Urals), one of the world’s largest iron smelting centers, blast furnace workers are increasing the production of pig iron. This month, they have over-produced thousands of tons of pig iron beyond the plan. A competition upsurge has also emerged in Soviet coal mines. In Donbas, the largest coal field in the Soviet Union, twenty-five mines have already entered the 1950 production.

　　In eastern Siberia, miners completed their eleven-month plan ahead of schedule.

　　News from various Soviet republics reports on the production victories achieved in commemoration of this holiday. In Kyiv, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, nearly fifty enterprises have completed their annual quotas. Many factories in Kazakhstan are commemorating this holiday by completing their annual plans ahead of schedule, including the fishermen of the Ural-Caspian Fisheries Trust, the employees of the Aral Sea Salt Company, and many factory workers. The canning factory in Moldavia manufactured millions of cans of canned goods in excess of the annual plan. The guarantee to commemorate December 5th with production exceeding the set quotas is being successfully fulfilled in the oil fields and machine manufacturing plants of Azerbaijan.
