The Fall of the French Queuille Coalition Government
By Zviadaev, Translated by Wang Pu
After two weeks of unsuccessful maneuvering within the government, Henri Queuille submitted his cabinet's resignation to President Auriol on October 5th.

What are the reasons for this most recent cabinet crisis in France?

Superficially, it was due to disagreements between Queuille and Finance Minister Petsche with several ministers from the Socialist Party. The devaluation of the franc was a completely predatory act against the French people, and several Socialist cabinet members, fearing complete exposure in the eyes of the masses, were forced to demand a review of the wage rates for low-income earners and the restoration of collective bargaining. Queuille and Petsche did not agree to this.

Although the French Premier made every effort to mediate, he could not resolve these disputes. Daily cabinet meetings failed to achieve their desired results, and a crisis within the government became inevitable. This time, even the outwardly strong but inwardly weak politicians of the Socialist Party's right wing, such as Mayer, dared not immediately compromise as they usually do, because the trade unions in various industries were resolutely united on the issue of wages. Queuille and Petsche's "experiment" in "price controls," which was clearly a delaying tactic, was also unable to resolve anything, as no one would fall for it.

However, the real reasons for the current crisis are, of course, deeper than the tactical differences between Queuille and his Socialist colleagues. This crisis is the result of all the previous policies of the cabinet. Its root lies in the fact that the Queuille government, during its year in office, led France down a political and economic dead end, making it impossible to find even a temporary escape at present.

The devaluation of the franc (which French official spokesmen explained was for the benefit of "Atlantic solidarity"), and the ensuing disagreements over wages and prices, are a direct consequence of France's participation in the Marshall Plan group and its collusion with the aggressive North Atlantic bloc.

　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

France occupies a special position among the countries of the Marshall Plan. In the aggressive plans of American imperialism, France is the largest country on the European continent after West Germany. Therefore, Wall Street is particularly eager to consolidate its control over the French economy and politics. And the ruling class in France has created the highest record of despicable submission to the dollar.

In 1940, when the vile Vichy gang took power after surrendering to Hitler, Pétain declared the slogan: "Return to the land!" This traitor wanted France to submit to the merger of its territory with fascist Germany. And now, these new gravediggers of France—from the hypocritical Moch of the Socialist Party to the Catholic Schuman and the Radical Queuille—have dug up Pétain's old slogan and set about destroying France's national industry, also telling the French people to return to the land, back to medieval handicrafts. On June 28th, Queuille's Minister of Defense, the right-wing Socialist Ramadier, made the following sarcastic remarks in the National Assembly:

"I believe we must return to the old quality of handicrafts."

This is not merely a matter of delivering speeches. The French government has drawn up an organized plan to reduce industrial production and has begun to implement it with a zeal worthy only of a better cause.

It can be said that deplorable things are now unfolding in France. They are a direct result of the Marshall Planization of French economic life. The Queuille government, from the very beginning, acted according to Washington's orders, its decision to "restructure" the nationalized aircraft industry as the aim of the French government; the result of doing so was the complete abolition of the French aircraft industry.

Ramadier even resorted to blackmailing the National Assembly in an effort to get the government's proposal on this matter passed. He threatened to resign if the government's proposal was overturned, and he also threatened a cabinet crisis and the disintegration of France's entire political life. On June 28th, he provocatively asserted in the Assembly that the quality of French aircraft "does not meet our requirements" and demanded that France "show greater humility and learn from other countries." Ramadier's anti-French expressions reached a climax when he told the parliament that "French workers and engineers lack the necessary ability and talent." Today, French cabinet members are also telling the parliament that the French people are like this!

What was Ramadier asking for? Under the pretext that ten large aircraft factories were "running at a loss," he wanted them to close down, while the remaining nine smaller factories should be reorganized into semi-handicraft factories to assemble machines purchased from the United States.

Ramadier got what he asked for: the National Assembly passed his bill, albeit by a very small majority. In July and August, aircraft factories in several places closed down. Those so-called Republican Security Corps troops, equipped with tanks and armored vehicles, were sent to the factories to suppress worker resistance. Some factories made prior arrangements, dismissing workers on holidays; when the workers returned, they found the factory gates tightly closed.

The reaction of French democratic opinion to these government measures was strong indignation. No one would be deceived by the claim that the aircraft industry was "running at a loss." Workers and technicians unanimously said that it was a complete lie.

Ramadier did not go to such lengths to conceal the true reason for closing the factories without a purpose. The reduction in aircraft industry production is beneficial to American monopoly capital, which wants to rule the French market without hindrance.

The National Aircraft Factory in Argenteuil manufactured tractors that French farmers desperately needed. The government announced that the factory was making a loss. And although there were 1,300 tractors sitting in the factory square, the authorities refused to sell them. At the same time, American ships docked at the port of Dieppe were unloading imported tractors and immediately putting them on the market.

The National Aircraft Factory in Issy-les-Moulineaux has been transferred to a company supported by Altom Thores, a trust controlled by American capital. Although French industry has sufficient machines and equipment to supply the needs of the French airline, the company is now going to the United States to purchase them.

Behind all these actions lies a very definite political purpose. The French government, by closing factories or transferring them to monopoly capital, such as the Lafarge-Teil company, which helped the Nazis build their boastful "Atlantic Wall," strengthened the position of reactionary elements in France and struck at the democratic forces, because the best part of the working class was thrown out of the industrial sector.

The Marshall Plan caused a serious crisis in the French railway transportation system. The general decline in production and the contraction of investment have led to a slump in the transport industry. In order to cope with the National Railway's losses, the construction of workshops, repair shops, and stations has been stopped, and the construction of vehicles and factories has also been reduced by 40 percent. They are even planning to suspend all "auxiliary" railway lines.

All these measures have forced 72,000 transport workers and 50,000 construction workers to be laid off. In addition, tens of thousands of workers in industries serving the transport system are also facing the prospect of unemployment.

Left-wing newspapers reported with great concern that the French National Railway has recently obtained 30 billion francs in private loans to cover its losses, and that investments by American capital are being considered. This concern is understandable. This kind of move really looks like a prelude to selling the entire railway to Wall Street financial giants.

The light industry, which has only recently become the pride of France, is also in a state of deplorable decline. For example, the production of the shoe industry is declining sharply. Of the 70 shoe factories in total, the ten largest have stopped production; now only fewer than 2,500 workers are employed in the factories that continue to produce, and this is at a time when France is exporting leather to Germany and the United States and importing leather shoes.

　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

American imperialists have long attempted to eliminate all tariff barriers among the countries of the Marshall Plan in order to obtain an unobstructed market. The French government yielded to Washington's pressure and took the lead over the other partners of the Marshall Plan: it was the first to surrender. At the end of August, it was announced that tariffs on certain items would be completely or partially abolished. This provision took effect on October 1st, and the items included textiles, agricultural tools, and mechanical equipment. The French domestic market was thus opened up to American imperialism, a situation that will further oppress French national industry.

Due to the fact that the French rulers are following this policy of surrender, the French national economy is in a deplorable situation. The Queuille government, until its last day in power, pursued its policy of destroying French industry. For example, recently there was also a decision to promote foreign investment in France proper and overseas territories.

The law published in the official newspaper stated that foreigners—it would be more correct to say "American merchants"—will henceforth enjoy the same rights as French people in terms of investment. However, when one remembers how weak the chances of French capital competing with American capital are, then it can be seen very clearly how seriously this decision will harm French independence.

The American invasion of French colonies is organized and sustained. An American oil company and the Anglo-Dutch joint venture Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company recently obtained a monopoly on the development of oil fields in Tunisia, with France retaining only 35 percent of the shares. Schuman even defended this abandonment of French national interests with various excuses, including asking the United Nations to act as a justification. He said that excluding foreign investment (of course, referring to American capital) from Tunisia would be a violation of the United Nations Charter!

American merchants have been granted permission by the French government (often without permission), to conduct investigations of French colonies. A group of American investigators recently visited French territories in Africa on behalf of the Marshall Plan Executive Bureau. According to Agence France-Presse, the results of their trip have been discussed at a secret meeting in Paris, and no French representatives were invited to attend the meeting.

Newspaper reports indicate that Wall Street's monopoly capital, which has long controlled 1,000 industrial companies in France proper and 122 companies in the colonies, is greatly disregarding French interests there. American trusts have been up to a lot of tricks, and have gotten involved in the iron ore and bauxite of French Guinea, the lead and cobalt of Morocco, the graphite and vanilla of Madagascar, and the timber resources of Gabon.

Even reactionary economic and financial publications are angered by the American merchants' domination of the French economy. The newspaper wrote:

"Whenever senior French officials debate certain difficult issues and are unable to defend themselves, they say that the Americans have the same view as them. Free sale of fuel? They say the Americans do not agree. Subsidies? They say the Americans are against this." The State Department maintains various agencies in France. The Paris American Embassy's publication "Bi-Monthly Bulletin" published a list in its January issue, including the Department of Trade and Salaries, the Department of Food and Agriculture, the Department of Labor and Manpower, the Department of Planning, Investigation, Recovery, and Progress, the Bureau of Defense, the Intelligence Office, the Tourist Board, the Legal Bureau, etc. The real purpose of all these "departments" and "bureaus" is to carry out control over the activities of the French government and its departments.

　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

The unfortunate consequences of the Americanization of France are clear to everyone. The budget imbalance and the increasing domestic and foreign debt. In the three months from January to March alone, the domestic debt increased by 123.165 billion francs, and the foreign debt increased by 22.853 billion francs. The soaring inflation, aggravated by extraordinary military expenses, is undermining French finances.

In 1948, France's national budget was short by 83 billion francs. But the rulers of France have not learned anything from this. They absolutely do not want to reduce the heavy military burden imposed on the French people by the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. They are carrying out a criminal colonial war against the Vietnamese people, a war which swallowed up more than 70 billion francs in 1948. Under the 1949 budget, military spending has increased again, now reaching 800 billion francs.

The terrible increase in unemployment has caused serious alarm in the French democratic camp. At the beginning of this year, the number of unemployed was 50,000, and it increased to 150,000 in August and September. This does not include the 450,000 people who are partially employed and working part-time.

Some newspapers are not without reason blaming the government for deliberately creating unemployment in order to force a large number of skilled workers to leave the cities and move to rural areas. Undoubtedly, this is entirely in line with the policy of turning France into an agricultural country, a policy adopted by American imperialists and the central aim of the Marshall Plan.

The warmongers are making France a raw material supplier for reactionary and divided West Germany, and the United States is restoring Germany as a military production base for future aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

The recent government crisis in France broke out shortly after the Queuille cabinet celebrated its first—and last—anniversary in power, with much fanfare from the entire reactionary press. This crisis shows how illusory and fragile the hope of exchanging "political stability" for the sale of national interests is. Only two or three weeks ago, Queuille boasted that he had "saved the Republic." Today, his cabinet has followed in the footsteps of other failed Marshallized French rulers.

The crisis of the Queuille cabinet has confirmed the bankruptcy of the reactionary policies pursued by the French ruling group. Regardless of how the political fortune tellers in the reactionary Paris newspapers judge which member of Queuille's cabinet "bombed" the cabinet, everyone who studies French politics is clear that the coalition government collapsed under the pressure of the dissatisfaction and protest of the French working people.

French trade unions are engaged in a hard struggle to fight for better living and working conditions. They are fighting against the attempts of monopoly capital to transfer all the consequences of Marshallization to the people. The leadership of the General Confederation of Labor is doing everything possible to fight for the legitimate demands of the masses. These demands include higher wages, a minimum wage provision that restricts employers from depressing wages, full pay for all workers on holidays, a shorter work week (which would give tens of thousands of unemployed people jobs), and a social insurance system, etc.

The political activity and high degree of class consciousness of the workers has forced the splinter group of the right-wing Socialist Party to declare—even if only in words—their support for the workers' demands.

Undoubtedly, the rulers of France will seek a way out of the crisis through the usual behind-the-scenes coalition. However, under the current circumstances, this can only produce an expedient solution. The intense class antagonism that is shaking France today can no longer be concealed by removing a few ministerial pawns from the political chessboard.

When Thorez spoke to his constituents in Montreuil, he analyzed the situation that developed after Queuille's resignation. Thorez declared that the current crisis is a direct result of the policy of Marshallizing France, a policy that represents poverty, reaction, and war. The suffering of the French people is the responsibility of the splitters of the workers' movement, and the Socialist Party leaders who helped exclude Communist cabinet members from the government, and those who, along with their colleagues in the cabinet, approved the Marshall Plan and the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. Thorez said that the French people demand an end to this policy. He said:

"The time has come to break the shackles imposed on our country by the US imperialist military bloc, and to rebuild our complete national independence. The time has come to establish in France a government that this country desires—a democratic and united government, a government of progress, freedom, and peace."

The entire French political experience since the war has proved the correctness of this statement.

　　法国葛义联合政府之垮台
    兹维达耶夫  著  王朴  译
    亨利·葛义在政府内进行了二周的不成功的谋略之后，于十月五日向阿里奥尔总统提出其内阁之辞呈。
    法国这最近的内阁危机的原因是什么呢？
    表面上，这是由于葛义和财政部长比许与社会党几个部长之间意见不和的原故。法郎的贬值对法国人民完全是一种掠夺的行为，社会党的几个阁员害怕在群众眼中完全暴露出来，他们被迫而要求审查低薪给者的工资率和恢复集体谈判。葛义和比许对此不予同意。
    法国总理虽然尽他拼死命的努力去调停，但也不能解决这些争端。内阁每天开会都不能获得他们所冀望的结果，政府中的危机终于不可避免。这一回，甚至那些社会党右派的外强中干的政客们如马耶之流，亦不也敢像他们惯常所做那样地即刻来一个妥协，因为各行业的工会在工资的问题上都坚决的团结一致。而葛义与比许在“限价”问题中的“试验”，这显然是一种拖延的计谋，亦一点无法调解，因为没有谁会上他们的当的。
    然而，目前危机的真正原因当然比葛义与其社会党同僚间在策略上的歧异是更深一层的。这危机是内阁以前所有政策的结果。其根源是由于葛义政府在其执政的一年中，使法国上了政治和经济的绝路，而致目前无法寻觅一个甚至是暂时的逃脱。
    法郎的贬值（法国官方发言人对这的解释是为了“大西洋休戚与共”的利益），以及随之而来的对于工资与物价问题的意见不一，是法国参加马歇尔计划集团并且与侵略的北大西洋集团勾结的一个直接的后果。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    法国在马歇尔计划各国间占有一个特殊的地位。在美国帝国主义的侵略计划中，法国在欧洲大陆上是西德后面的最大国家。因此，华尔街特别急于巩固其对法国经济与政治的控制。而在法国的统治阶级方面，他们亦创造了对金元的可鄙屈服的最高纪录。
    在一九四○年，当卑鄙的维琪班子在向希特勒投降之后而执政的时候，贝当宣称了这个口号：“回到土地去！”这个叛国者要法国忍从于其领土与法西斯德国并合。而现在，这批法国的新掘墓人——从社会党的虚伪的莫许，到天主教的舒曼和急进党的葛义——已经掘出了这个贝当的老口号，并且着手毁灭法国的民族工业，还告诉法国人民要回到土地去，回到中世纪的手工业去。在六月二十八日，葛义的国防部长，右派社会党的拉玛第在国民大会中作了下列讥讽的发言：
    “我相信我们必须回到手工业品的古老品质去。”
    这不是仅仅发表演讲的一回事。法国政府已制作了一个有组织的减缩工业生产的计划，而且已经以一种只有为一个更好的事业才值得的热心去开始实施这个计划了。
    实在可以说是可悲的事情现在正在法国展开。它们是法国经济生活马歇尔计划化的一个直接结果。葛义政府从开始便按照华盛顿的命令行事，它的决定“改组”国有化飞机工业作为法国政府之目的；这样做的结果就是整个取消了法国的飞机工业。
    拉玛第竟做到勒索国民议会以尽力获得有关此事的政府提案的通过。他威胁着，如果政府提案被推翻，他便要辞职，还威胁着要发生内阁危机和法国整个政治生活的解体等。在六月二十八日，他在大会中带挑拨性地确言，说法国飞机的品质“不合我们的要求”，并且要求法国要“表现更大的谦虚，向其他国家学习。”拉玛第的反法国的流露达到最高峰了，当他告诉议会说“法国的工人和工程师缺乏必需的能力和才干。”今天法国的阁员们亦告诉国会说法国人民是这样的！
    拉玛第所要求的是什么呢？他借口十个大飞机厂“入不敷出”而要它们关门，剩下来的九个较小的工厂，却应该改组为半手工的工厂，来装配购自美国的机器。
    拉玛第得到他所要求的：国民议会通过了他的议案，虽然只是很小的多数票而已。七八月时，几个地方的飞机工厂关门了。那些所谓共和国保安团的队伍，配备着坦克和装甲车，给派到工厂去破坏工人的抵抗。有些工厂进行些事前的布置，它们在假日时遣散了工人；当工人们回来时，他们发觉了工厂的大门关得紧紧的了。
    法国民主意见对于这些政府措施的反应是强烈的愤慨。谁亦不会被那飞机工业“入不敷出”的说法所欺骗。工人和技师们一致地说这澈头澈尾是一个说谎。
    拉玛第这样辛苦地设法去掩盖关闭工厂的真正理由不是没有他的目的。飞机工业生产的减缩对于美国独占资本是有利的，美国独占资本要毫无障碍地统治法国的市场。
    阿根杜伊尔的国家飞机工厂制造法国农民非常需要的拖拉机。政府宣布该工厂有了亏损。而且虽然工厂广场上放着一千三百架拖拉机，当局却拒绝把它们卖出去。在同一时候，停在第厄普港的美国船只却正在卸下泊来的拖拉机，并且即刻放到市场上去。
    在伊西摩林奴的国家飞机工厂已经移交给阿尔当姆托拉斯所支持的一个公司，该托拉斯由美国资本所控制。虽然法国工业以其机器与设备足以供给法国航空公司需用的飞机，但刻公司却去美国购买。
    在这一切的行为后面，有着一个非常确定的政治目的。法国政府把工厂关闭或者移交给独占资本如曾帮助纳粹建筑其自夸自炫的“大西洋城防”的那家拉法治——台尔公司等，增强了法国国内反动分子的地位，打击了民主力量，因为工人阶级最好的一部分力量给抛出工业领域之外了。
    马歇尔计划引起了法国铁道运输系统一个严重的危机。生产的一般下降以及投资的收缩造成运载业的下跌。为了应付国家铁路的入不敷出，工场、修理厂和车站的建筑都停止了，而车辆和工厂的修建亦削减了百分之四十。他们甚至还计划着停歇所有的“辅助”铁路线。
    这一切的措施使得七万二千个运输工人和五万个建筑工人不得不受到解雇。此外，服务于运输系统的工业中的几万工人亦面对着失业的前途。
    左翼报纸很担心地报导称，法国国家铁路近来获得了三百亿法郎的私人贷款以应付亏空，而且美国资本的投资正被考虑。这种担心是很可以理解的。这一类的出手实在很像是要把整个铁路出卖给华尔街金融巨头的前奏。
    只是在近来才成为法国的骄傲的轻工业也处于一种可悲的下降的情况中。举例来说，制鞋工业的生产是厉害地下降着。在全数七十个制鞋工厂中，最大的十家已经停止生产；现在只有不够二千五百个工人雇用于继续生产的工厂中，而这是在一个当法国向德国和美国输出皮革并输入皮鞋的时候呀。
    　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    美国帝国主义者久已企图消除马歇尔计划各国的一切关税壁垒，以便获得一个毫无障碍的市场。法国政府屈服于华盛顿的压力，比马歇尔计划的其他伙伴还占先：它是头一个投降了的。八月末，宣布了某些物品的关税将全部或部分取消。此项规定于十月一日生效，物品包括纺织品、农具和机械设备。法国的国内市场便这样地向美国帝国主义洞开了，这种情况必将使法国民族工业更进一步的被压迫。
    由于法国统治者遵行这个投降政策，使得法国国民经济处于可悲的情况中。葛义政府直至当权的最后一日，还是奉行它那破坏法国工业的政策。例如，最近还有促进外国在法国本部与海外属地投资的决定。
    在官方报纸上发表的法律称：外国人——说“美国商人”会更正确些——在投资方面以后将与法国人享受同样的权利。但是，当想起法国资本要和美国资本竞争只有多么微弱的机会，那么就可以很清楚地看到这种决定会怎样严重地危害法国的独立。
    美国侵入法国的殖民地是有组织而且持续的。美国一家石油公司和英荷合办的皇家荷兰壳牌石油公司，最近获得开发突尼斯油田的垄断权，法国只保有百分之三十五的股份。这种对法国民族利益的抛弃，舒曼竟在各种借口中以要求联合国来作为声辩。他说排斥外资（当然，是指美国资本）出突尼斯将是违反联合国宪章！
    美国商人得了法国政府的允许（时常却是没有得到允许的），进行调查法国殖民地。一群美国调查人员最近代表马歇尔计划执行局拜访法国在非洲的属地。据法新社报导，他们此行的结果已在巴黎的一次秘密会议中讨论过，没有法国代表被邀参加这个会议。
    报纸上的报导指出：华尔街的独占资本，久已控制了法国本部一千家工业公司和殖民地的一百二十二家公司，在那里，他们非常忽视法国的权益。美国托拉斯干了许多的勾当，而且染指了法属几内亚的铁矿和铁矾土，摩洛哥的铅和钴，马达加斯加的石墨和香兰果，以及加蓬的木材资源等。
    甚至反动的经济财政遇刊，亦为美国商人对法国经济的统治所激怒。该报写道：
    “每当法国高级官员辩论某些困难问题而至无法声辩时，他们便说美国人和他们具有同一看法。燃料自由销售吗？他们说美国人不赞同。补助金吗？他们说美国人反对这个。”国务院维持各式的机关于法国。巴黎美国大使馆的刊物“半月文告”，于一月份的一期上发表了一个清单，有贸易与薪给部，有粮食农业部，有劳工与劳动力部，有计划调查兴复与进展部，有保卫局、情报处、游览委员会、法事局等等。这一切的“部”和“局”的真正目的，是为了执行对法国政府及其各部门之活动的控制。
    　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    法兰西美国化的不幸的结果，是大家都看清楚的。预算的不平衡与内债外债的与日俱增。仅在一月至三月三个月中，内债增加了一二三、一六五百万法郎，外债增加了二二、八五三百万法郎。由于不平常的军事费用而加重的飞跃的通货膨胀，破坏了法国的财政。
    在一九四八年，法国的国家预算不敷达八百三十亿法郎。但是法国的统治者们没有从这接受什么教训。他们绝不想去减少那由于侵略的北大西洋公约所加诸法国人民身上的重大的军事负担。他们正进行着反对越南人民的罪恶的殖民地战争，这个战争，在一九四八年便吞没了七百亿以上的法郎。在一九四九年预算之下，军事费用又再增加，现在已达八千亿法郎了。
    失业的可怕的增加，已使法国民主阵营引起严重的警觉。在本年开始，失业者人数为五万人，八九月时增至十五万人。这还不包括部分工作的半就业者四十五万人在内。
    有些报纸不是没有理由地责骂政府故意地制造失业，以便强迫大量技术工人离开城市迁徒至农村地区。无疑的这是完全符合于促使法国成为农业国的政策的，这个政策为美国帝国主义者所采纳并且为马歇尔计划之中心目的。
    战争贩子们使法国成为反动而分裂的西德的原料供给者，美国正在恢复德国成为一个军事生产基地，以为将来侵略苏联和人民民主国家。
    　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    在葛义内阁由整个反动报纸虚张声势地庆祝它当政的第一个——最后一个——周年纪念之后不久，法国便爆发了最近的政府危机。这个危机表明了以出卖民族利益而换取“政治稳定”的希望是如何的幻灭和脆弱。还只是在二三个星期以前的时候，葛义自夸着他已“拯救了共和国”。今天他的内阁却走上了其他失败的马歇尔化的法国统治者的道路。
    葛义内阁的危机，证实了法国统治集团所奉行的反动政策的破产。尽管反动的巴黎报纸的那些政治算命者，怎样去判断葛义的那一个搁员“轰毁了”内阁，但每个研究法国政治的人，都很清楚联合政府是在法国劳动人民的不满和抗义的压力之下而崩溃的。
    法国的工会正在艰苦的斗争，以争贩更好的生活与劳动条件。他们正在对独占资本转嫁马歇尔计划化的一切后果到人民身上的企图进行斗争。劳工总联盟的领导方面，正在尽一切力量以争取群众的正当要求。这些要求包括较高的工资，一种限制雇主压低工资的最低工资规定，所有工人假日照发工资，工作周缩短（这将给予几万失业者以工作），还有社会保险制度等等。
    工人的政治活动和高度阶级觉悟，已强迫了右派社会党的分裂分子集团亦不得不宣称——就算仅是字面上而已吧——他们对工人要求的支持。
    无疑的法国的统治者，将以习惯的幕后联合来找求危机的一条出路。然而，在现情况之下，这只能产生权宜之计的解决办法。震动今日法国的强烈的阶级敌对已不能再以从政治棋盘上移去几个部长小卒来掩盖了。
    多列士在蒙特洛治向他的选民演说时，他分析了葛义辞职后所发展的局势。多列士宣称，目前的危机是使法国马歇尔计划化的政策的直接后果，这种政策代表了贫困、反动和战争。法国人民的苦难应由工人运动的分裂分子负责，应由那些帮助排斥共产党阁员离开政府的社会党领袖们负责，这些人与他们在内阁中的同僚们批准了马歇尔计划和侵略的北大西洋公约。多列士说，法国人民要求结束这种政策。他说：
    “打破美帝军事集团加诸我国的桎梏，并重建我们完整的民族独立的时候已经到来了。在法国建立一个这国家所希望的政府——一个民主团结的政府，进步、自由与和平的政府——的时候已经到来了。”
    战争以来整个的法国政治经验，证明了这声明之正确。
