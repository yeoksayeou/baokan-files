Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th: American guest Elizabeth Millard gave a speech at the Asian Women's Representative Conference on the 13th. The following is a summary:

　　We have a great responsibility. The country we come from is the concentration of the greatest force that constitutes a threat to world peace and happiness today.

　　The victory of the Chinese people dealt a heavy blow to the United States' policy towards the whole world. The US State Department, in its published White Paper, lamented: "This victory is the product of internal forces in China, forces that the United States has attempted to influence, but has been unable to do so."

　　The US government is attempting to influence the "internal forces" of all countries in the world that have not yet gained freedom. It supports British, French, and Dutch imperialism in oppressing the people. US financial capital plans to further conquer colonial countries through Truman's so-called "technical assistance" program to underdeveloped countries. In order to obtain US dollars, the governments of various "assisted" countries must guarantee to suppress strikes and people's liberation movements. The result is more bloodshed and sacrifice for the people of various countries, suffering more cruel oppression.

　　But although the American reactionaries have bought off the traitors of these countries and given them money and guns, they cannot stop the inevitable victory of the people. "Internal forces" -- the power of the people -- throughout the world, including the United States, will defeat American imperialism and achieve victory.

　　American workers have already discovered that they are not free. They have discovered that the planes and money given to Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionaries of various countries are borne by them, and that this reactionary foreign policy of the United States brings them unemployment and suffering. Now the number of unemployed workers has reached five or six million, of which women account for 30 percent.

　　The American Women's Congress is fighting side by side with other progressive groups. More and more men and women are seeing the adverse effects of government policies on their daily lives and are joining the struggle for peace.

　　The persecution and violence employed by the US government against those who openly oppose government policies is increasing day by day. But we know that we have a great responsibility to the people of the world, and that responsibility is not only to continue the struggle, but also to strengthen the battle in every way.

　　We derive the greatest strength and inspiration from the great historical examples of China, the people's democratic countries of Europe, and especially the Soviet Union, which now holds high the bright hope of mankind to the world more than ever before. The heroic struggles and great victories of these countries have strengthened our courage and determination to fight.

　　We know that we, united together, can win a world of peace in our generation.

　　美国来宾米拉尔德发言
    【新华社北京十四日电】美国来宾伊利莎白·米拉尔德十三日在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言，摘要如下：
    我们有一个重大的责任，我们所来自的国家是今天构成对世界和平与幸福最大威胁的力量集中地。
    中国人民的胜利，使美国对全世界的政策受到沉重的打击。美国国务院在其所发表的白皮书中曾经哀鸣说：“这个胜利是中国内部力量的产物，这个力量美国曾企图加以影响，但为力所不及。”
    美国政府正企图对世界上一切尚未得到自由国家的“内部力量”加以影响，它支持英、法、荷帝国主义压迫人民。美国财政资本计划通过杜鲁门的所谓对落后国家实行“技术援助”的计划，更进一步征服殖民地国家。各受“援”国的政府为了获得美元，须向美国保证镇压罢工和人民解放运动。其结果则是各国人民更多的流血与牺牲，遭受到更残酷的压迫。
    但是美国反动派虽然收买了这些国家的叛徒并且给予金元和枪炮，但却不能阻挡不可避免的人民的胜利。“内部力量”——人民的力量——在全世界包括美国在内，都将击败美帝取得胜利。
    美国的工人已经发现他们自己不是自由的，他们发现送给蒋介石以及各国反动派的飞机、金元都是由他们负担的，而美国这种反动的外交政策给他们带来的则是失业和痛苦。现在失业工人的数字已达五、六百万人，其中妇女占百分之三十。
    美国妇女大会正和其他进步团体并肩战斗，愈来愈多的男女人民在看到政府政策对他们日常生活的恶劣影响后，参加了争取和平的斗争。
    美国政府对公开声言反对政府政策的人所采取的迫害和暴力正与日俱增。但我们知道我们对世界人民负有重大的负任，这责任就是不仅要继续斗争，并且要用一切方法来加强战斗。
    我们从中国、欧洲人民民主国家，特别是从苏联的伟大史例，得到最伟大的力量与鼓舞，苏联现在比过去任何时候更高地向全世界高擎着人类光明的希望；由于这些国家的英勇战斗和伟大胜利加强了我们战斗的勇气和决心。
    我们知道，团结在一起的我们，能够就在我们这一代，赢得和平的世界。
