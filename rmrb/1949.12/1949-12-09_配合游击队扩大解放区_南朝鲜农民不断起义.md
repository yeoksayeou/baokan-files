　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 7th: The flames of peasant uprisings in South Korea are continuing to spread. On November 28th, more than a thousand peasants in Dongxi, Chicheng, Fuxing, and other districts of Sunchang County, North Jeolla Province, rose up, purged local anti-communists, and confiscated their property and weapons.

　　On the same day, more than three hundred peasants in the Caishan area of Bonghwa County, North Gyeongsang Province, coordinated with the guerrillas who had attacked the area, captured five reactionary elements alive, and held a mass meeting to publicly try them. More than seven hundred peasants in the Warim area of Gyeongsan County, South Gyeongsang Province, also rose up on November 29th and, in coordination with the guerrillas, purged more than fifty members of reactionary landlord violence gangs, shouting slogans such as "Land distribution without compensation."

　　Meanwhile, according to a recent report in the South Korean Laborer's Newspaper, the People's Guerrilla forces, with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of peasants, are expanding the liberated areas and gradually restoring People's Committees to implement land reform. The newspaper stated that the areas where democratic power has recently been restored include areas near Mount Jiri in South Gyeongsang Province, the Bukhu District of Andong County in North Gyeongsang Province, the Munsu District of Yeongju County, and the Ongjin County area in western Gyeonggi Province.
