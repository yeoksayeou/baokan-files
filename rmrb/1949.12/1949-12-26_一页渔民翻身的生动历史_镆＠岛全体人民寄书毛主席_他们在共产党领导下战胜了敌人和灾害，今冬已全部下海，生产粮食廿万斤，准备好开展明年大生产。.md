A Vivid History of Fishermen's Emancipation
　　All People of 镆＠ Island Send Letter to Chairman Mao
They defeated enemies and disasters under the leadership of the Communist Party. All of them have gone to sea this winter, producing 200,000 jin of grain and preparing for large-scale production next year.
[Report from Our Newspaper] The people of 镆＠ Island, Shidao City, Jiaodong, who have suffered from the oppression and exploitation of Japanese invaders, Kuomintang bandits, and feudal forces, have gradually restored production and improved their lives under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government after liberation. They recently wrote to Chairman Mao to report on the production situation this winter. The original text is as follows:
Chairman Mao:
镆＠ Island is a small island to the east of Shidao City, Jiaodong District, Shandong Province. The island has 3,600 mu of land and 3,600 residents, who live entirely by fishing.
A hundred years ago, it was the initial stage of fisheries development. The fish caught by fishermen were completely independent and sold freely. At that time, the lives of fishermen could still be maintained. During the peak period of fisheries, there were a total of 175 boats and 4,375 nets. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were heavy taxes and feudal exploitation. The total income of fishermen's production was squeezed by 20% by taxes. Fishing firms used large scales of 32 taels to weigh the fish and shrimp of fishermen, and implemented high-interest exploitation of 3.5% monthly interest, which caused the income of fishermen's production to be insufficient to cover expenses. The most serious period was in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), when 20% of the land was mortgaged to feudal fishing firms, 50% of fishing boats and nets were mortgaged, and fishermen had only 95 fishing boats and 2,375 nets left. The lives of fishermen gradually became difficult. In the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the evil Japanese invaders occupied Shidao. In addition to the increasing heavy taxes and feudal exploitation, they also carried out burning, killing, looting, and sea blockades, making it impossible to fish, and the lives of the people reached a dead end.
At this time, the savior, the Communist Party, came, established the foundation of the Party, established a democratic government, and led the people to organize, establish fishermen's associations and maritime militias, and launched struggles against aiding the enemy, against blockades, and against feudal exploitation. They fought countless times with the Japanese invaders on the sea to seize boats, break through the blockade lines, expand the sea area, and continue to develop production. They conducted reasonable liquidation with the feudal exploiting fishing firms, and demanded back their mortgaged fishing boats, nets, and land. Then, with the government's loan support, they led us to organize and establish mutual aid organizations, established many cooperatives, reduced intermediate exploitation, and fisheries production was restored and developed. Now there are 149 fishing boats and 3,959 nets, and lives have been improved. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, under your wise leadership, with the branch as the leading core, we launched a cultural movement, popularized national education, the people's awareness was generally improved, we recognized the enemy and ourselves, launched an anti-Chiang movement, and set off a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. A total of 315 people from the whole island joined the army.
The Communist Party members on the whole island account for more than 10% of the total population. This year, under your call of "increasing production by an inch," we are all actively producing and solving the difficulties in production through social mutual assistance and neighborhood help. This year, we added 14 fishing boats and 254 nets, which can produce a total of 2.5 million jin of fish and shrimp, equivalent to 2 million jin of food. In this year's typhoon disaster, we overcame the famine by relying on the mountains to eat mountains and relying on the sea to eat the sea, and by using the method of fishing all year round. This winter, we have all gone to sea and have now produced 200,000 jin of grain, laying the foundation for large-scale production next year. In order to liberate all of China and completely eliminate the remaining bandits, 30 of our fishermen, with great courage, went to support the front line, liberate Taiwan, and make meritorious service across the sea, so as to achieve the ultimate victory of eliminating the remaining bandits, and further strive to complete the glorious task of production and construction!
　　　Respectfully wish you
Good health!　All the people of 镆＠ Island, Shidao City, Jiaodong District, Shandong Province, salute you.
　　　December 16, 1949.

　　一页渔民翻身的生动历史
　  镆＠岛全体人民寄书毛主席
    他们在共产党领导下战胜了敌人和灾害，今冬已全部下海，生产粮食廿万斤，准备好开展明年大生产。
    【本报讯】饱受日寇、国民党匪帮与封建势力压榨、剥削的胶东石岛市镆＠岛人民，解放后在共产党及人民政府领导和扶植下，生产逐渐恢复，生活日益改善。特于日前上书毛主席，报告今冬生产情况，原文如下：毛主席：
    镆＠岛是山东省胶东区石岛市市东面的一个小岛，该岛有土地三千六百亩，居民三千六百人，完全以捕鱼为生。
    百年前是渔业初发展的时期，渔民捕得之鱼完全独立自主，随便出卖，那时渔民生活尚能维持。当渔业最盛时期，共有船一七五只，网四三七五块。民国初年，上有苛捐杂税，下有封建剥削，渔民生产的总收入，能被捐税榨取百分之二十，渔行以三十二两的大秤来称渔民的鱼虾，实行月息三分五厘的高利剥削，致使渔民生产的收入不敷支出。最严重的时期是民国二十三年，土地被封建渔行押去百分之二十，渔船渔网被押去百分之五十，渔民的渔船只剩了九十五只，渔网只剩了二三七五块，渔民生活逐步走上困难。民国二十九年，万恶的日寇盘踞石岛，除苛捐杂税、封建剥削有增无减外，又进行了烧杀掠夺、海而封锁，无法捕鱼，人民生活走上绝境。
    这时来了救命恩人共产党，建立了党的基础，建立了民主政权，领导人民组织起来，成立渔会和海上民兵，开展反资敌、反封锁、反封建剥削等斗争，曾与日寇进行了无数次的海面夺船，冲破了封锁线，扩大海面，继续开展了生产；向封建的剥削渔行进行了讲理清算，要回自己被押去的渔船、渔网和土地，继而有政府的贷款扶持，并领导我们组织起来，成立了互助组织，建立了多少合作社，减免了中间剥削，渔业生产得到了恢复与发展。现在有渔船一四九只，渔网三九五九块，生活借以得到改善。日寇投降后，我们在你的英明领导下，以支部为领导核心，开展了文化运动，普及了国民教育，人民觉悟普遍提高，认清了敌我是非，开展了反蒋运动，掀起了参军热潮，全岛共参军者三百十五名。
    全岛共产党员占总人口的百分之十以上，今年在你的“生产长一寸”的号召下，我们都积极生产，以社会互济、亲邻相助的办法，解决了生产中的困难。今年增添渔船十四只，渔网二百五十四块，共计能生产鱼虾二百五十万斤，折合食粮二百万斤。在今年的台风灾情下，我们以靠山吃山、靠海吃海，以常年捕鱼的办法克服了灾荒。今冬我们已经全部下海，现在已生产了二十万斤粮食，奠定了明年大生产的基础。为了解放全中国，彻底消灭残匪，我们有三十名渔民，抱着万分的勇气，去支援前线，解放台湾跨海立功，以达到最后消灭残匪的胜利目的，进一步的努力完成生产建设的光荣任务！
