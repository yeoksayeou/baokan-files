　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st: On the eve of Chongqing's liberation, the remnant Kuomintang bandits were in utter disarray, scrambling to escape. The bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek fled in panic to Chengdu on the morning of the 30th, while the two bandits, Yan Xishan and Zhang Qun, had already fled to Chengdu on the 28th. Most of the other bandit leaders fled to Chengdu, and a small number fled to Taiwan. Although Chennault's "Civil Air Transport" used all of its planes to shuttle between Chongqing and Chengdu day and night, the senior bandit officials, fearing to be left behind, staged a tense scramble at the airport. A Reuters dispatch on the 29th reported the scene when the last plane escaped from Jiulongpo Airport: "About thirty passengers abandoned their luggage and scrambled to board the plane, but another twenty-seven passengers did not make it on board." On land, the Chengdu-Chongqing highway was congested with vehicles, and traffic was blocked, with hundreds of vehicles waiting to cross at the ferry near Neijiang. Simultaneously with the bandit officials fleeing, the remaining bandit troops also scrambled to escape. According to the Associated Press, most of the fleeing bandit troops were wearing straw sandals or were barefoot, and 30 percent were still wearing summer uniforms. "Soldiers often forced rickshaw pullers to carry their belongings, and sedan chair carriers to carry weapons and ammunition. Military vehicles congested the main roads, and traffic accidents were commonplace."

　　重庆解放前夕残匪争相逃命
    【新华社北京一日电】在重庆解放前夕，国民党残匪狼狈不堪地争相逃命。匪首蒋介石于三十日晨间仓皇逃抵成都，阎锡山、张群尔两匪则早于二十八日即已逃蓉。其他匪首大部逃蓉，小部，逃往台湾。虽然陈纳德的“民运航空队”使用了它所有的飞机整日整夜地来往于渝蓉之间，但逃命唯恐落后的高级匪官，在机场上演出了紧张的争夺战。路透社二十九日电报道九龙坡机场最后一架飞机逃时的情形称：约有三十名乘客丢弃了行李，争先恐后地登机，但另外有二十七名乘客没有挤上飞机。在陆上，成渝公路上车辆拥挤，交通阻塞，内江附近渡口待渡的车辆达数百辆。与匪官飞逃同时，残余匪军也争相逃命，据美联社报道，多数溃逃的匪军都着草鞋或打光脚板，百分之三十仍着夏季军服。“兵士们时时勒令洋车夫拉他们的东西，滑竿夫抬着武器和弹药。通衢大道上军车拥挤，车祸司空见惯。”
