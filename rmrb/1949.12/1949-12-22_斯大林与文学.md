　　Stalin and Literature
  　　　　　(III)
    The inspirational effect of Marxist-Leninist literary theory on literary and art workers worldwide is unparalleled. Inspired by them, we began to realize the organic relationship between worldviews and creative methods, and how to unify them.
    However, it was during the Stalin era that literary creation became so closely linked with the regime, the lives of the people, and the destiny of the nation, while simultaneously promoting its development on a large scale with such favorable conditions. Only in the Stalin era did literary and art workers truly become "engineers of the human soul." This is because, at this point, literary and art work was coordinated with the great socialist construction and included in major national cultural projects. Along with the Soviet system came the unprecedented Soviet man. Since the subjects of literature leaped from the decadent and despairing "superfluous men" of the pre-revolutionary period to the "Soviet men" of today, who demonstrate the highest qualities in socialist construction and the Patriotic War, Russian literature has shone with unprecedented brilliance and has become a superior existence that decisively overwhelms all bourgeois literature.
    Mao Zedong's literary thought is precisely the inheritance and Sinicization of Stalin's thought. Since the speeches at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, under the spiritual cultivation of Chairman Mao, the new literature and art in the liberated areas and throughout China has had the correct direction and rapid growth. In the future, we will enter the nation-building stage, and our future is limitless. The scale will also be unparalleled. However, timely efforts to learn from Soviet literature under Stalin's leadership will be a powerful guarantee for the development of our new literature and art.

    Last month, our cultural circles and trade unions sent fifteen representatives to the Soviet Union to participate in the October Revolution anniversary celebrations. The Soviet Writers' Association held a symposium with us. At this symposium, we asked them how they carried out the rural cultural movement after the October Revolution. The writers Solokov and Grovaeva gave us satisfactory answers one after another. The reply mentioned that the state sent 25,000 cultural cadres to the countryside to lead this work. Mr. Grovaeva was a member of the Rural Work Committee at the time; Mr. Solokov served as the director of a rural reading room for three years. From these examples, we can see how their country and writers attach importance to this work.
    Today, as we celebrate the birthday of Marshal Stalin, everyone is proposing the slogan of learning from the Soviet Union. May our cultural departments and cultural circles learn from their spirit of carrying out the rural cultural movement in those days to carry out our rural cultural movement.

　　斯大林与文学
  　　　　　（三）
    马克思列宁主义的文学论对全世界文艺工作者所起的启示作用是无比伟大的。由他们的启示，我们开始意识到世界观与创作方法的有机关系而企图如何去统一他们。
    但文学创作与政权，与人民生活，与民族运命结合得如此之紧，同时以如此顺利条件广大规模，策划推动其发展则是斯大林时代的事。文艺工作者只有在斯大林时代才真正是成为“人类灵魂的工程师”。因为文艺工作至此才与伟大社会主义建设相配合，列入国家重大的文化工程。随着苏维埃制度产生了史无前例的苏维埃人。自从文学的主题人物从革命前期的颓废绝望的“多余的人”飞跃到今天在社会主义建设与卫国战争中表现了最高品质的“苏维埃人”，俄国文学才成放出前所未有的光辉，也成为断然压倒一切资产阶级文学的高级存在。
    毛泽东的文艺思想，正是斯大林思想的继承与中国化。自从一九四二年延安文艺座谈会发言以来，在毛主席精神培育下，解放区以及全中国的新文艺有了正确的方向和飞速的成长。今后我们将进入建国阶段，我们的前途是无量的。规模也将是无比广大的。但及时努力从在斯大林领导下的苏联文学学习，将是我们新文艺发展的有力保障。

    前一个月，我国文化界与职工会派出十五个代表到苏联去参加十月革命纪念典礼，苏联的作家协会曾和我们开了一次座谈会。在这次座谈会上，我们问到他们在十月革命后怎样开展乡村文化运动，作家所罗科夫和格罗外瓦先后给了我们圆满的答复。答复中曾说到当时国家派两万五千名文化干部下乡领导此项工作。格罗外瓦先生当时是农村工作委员会委员；所罗科夫先生当时当过三年农村阅报室主任。从这些事例中，可以看到他们的国家和作家们是怎样重视这一工作。
    在为斯大林大元帅祝寿的今天，大家都提出向苏联学习的口号，愿我们的文化部门和文化界同人学习他们当日开展乡村文化运动这种精神来开展我们的乡村文化运动。
