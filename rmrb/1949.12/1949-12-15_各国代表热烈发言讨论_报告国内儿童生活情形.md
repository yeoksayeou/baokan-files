In his speech, Vietnamese representative Ho Duc Minh pointed out that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made the greatest efforts to develop children's affairs. The right of children to receive education is clearly stipulated in the constitution, and children have established their own organization - the United Association of Children Receiving National Aid. However, in the unliberated areas of Vietnam, children are suffering from cruel oppression and hunger. Therefore, many children, like adults, have participated in the heroic struggle against French imperialism.

In her speech, Chinese representative Kang Keqing first listed the experiences of children in old China. She cited Dahe Village in Wanping County, Hebei Province, as an example. In the past, 79 women in the village gave birth to a total of 440 children, but 254 died, with a mortality rate of 57% of the birth rate. According to the Wenhui Daily on April 5, 1947, in old Shanghai, a single charitable organization buried 591 children's corpses in just two days, March 1st and 2nd. However, after liberation, China's childcare has developed rapidly. In the countryside, due to land reform and improved farmers' lives, people generally hope to have children. Based on some materials, she pointed out that in the liberated cities, there are already 618 pediatric hospitals and obstetrics and gynecology and maternal and child health institutions.

Mongolian representative Nasalaga said: The Mongolian People's Republic began to improve children's living and educational conditions in the early days of its establishment. Now, mothers have 90 days of leave, and wages are paid as usual. The number of maternity hospitals is increasing year by year, and the number of nurseries has increased by 300% compared with before the Second World War.

Iranian representative Masin Farroki's speech exposed the suffering that imperialism and the reactionary Iranian government brought to Iranian children. She exclaimed: Iranian mothers are determined to further strengthen the struggle to overthrow the British and American imperialism and its lackeys – the Iranian puppet government – who are throwing our children into death!

Soviet representative Aslanova said: The future of our children depends first and foremost on our efforts to uphold peace and prevent the war that imperialism is preparing to re-launch. Soviet women warmly support the decision of the World Democratic Women's Federation Council on International Children's Day. We call on everyone to take International Children's Day as a day to mobilize all democratic forces in the world to defend children's rights. The first demand of all democratic forces must be to strictly prohibit illegal child labor, for the state to protect children's health, and to reduce military spending to increase state spending on children.

Xinjiang representative Rashida said: The people of Xinjiang have always been deceived and oppressed by feudal emperors and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Until liberation, we did not know what nurseries were, what kindergartens were, nor had we heard of children's hospitals, so the child mortality rate was very high. Now, thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Xinjiang has been liberated, and the people of Xinjiang will devote their best efforts to the construction of new democracy and develop the economic and cultural life of children.

　　各国代表热烈发言讨论
  　报告国内儿童生活情形
    越南代表胡德明在发言中指出，越南人民共和国对于发展儿童事业付出了最大的努力，儿童受教育的权利在宪法中有明文规定，儿童们成立了自己的组织——儿童受国联合会。但在越南待解放区，儿童们则正遭受着残酷的压迫和饥饿，因此，许多儿童和成人一样参加了反抗法国帝国主义的英勇斗争。
    中国代表康克清发言中首先列举了旧中国儿童的遭遇，她把河北宛平县搭河村为例，该村七十九个妇女过去共生了四百四十个小孩，而有二百五十四个死去，死亡率占出生率百分之五十七。据一九四七年四月五日文汇报所载，在旧上海仅仅一个慈善团体在三月一、二两日内就收埋了五百九十一具童尸。但解放后的中国儿童保育事业已得到迅速发展，乡村由于进行土地改革，农民生活改善，普遍希望生孩子。她根据一部分材料指出，在解放了的城市中已有六百一十八处儿科医院和产科及妇婴卫生机关。
    蒙古代表娜撒拉加在发言中说：蒙古人民共和国在成立的初期就开始改善儿童生活和教育条件。现在产妇有着九十天的假期，并且工资照发。产科医院在逐年增加，托儿所的数目较第二次世界大战前增加了百分之三百。
    伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪的发言暴露了帝国主义及伊朗反动政府带给伊朗儿童的苦难。她高呼：伊朗的母亲们决定更加加强斗争，打倒将孩子们投入死亡的英美帝国主义及其走狗——伊朗奴才政府！
    苏联代表阿斯拉诺娃说：我们儿童的将来，首先是要靠我们努力坚持和平和阻止帝国主义正在重新准备的战争。苏联妇女热烈拥护世界民主妇联理事会关于国际儿童日的决定。我们号召大家把国际儿童日作为动员世界一切民主力量保卫儿童权利的日子。一切民主力量的第一个要求必须是严禁非法雇佣儿童，国家保护儿童的健康，以及减缩军费以增加国家对儿童的费用。
    新疆代表拉西达说：新疆人民历来受着封建帝王及国民党反动派的欺骗压迫，直到解放，我们不知道什么是托儿所，什么是幼稚园，也没听过儿童医院，所以儿童的死亡率很大。现在由于中国共产党的领导，新疆获得了解放，新疆人民将以最大努力从事于新民主主义建设，并发展儿童的经济文化生活。
