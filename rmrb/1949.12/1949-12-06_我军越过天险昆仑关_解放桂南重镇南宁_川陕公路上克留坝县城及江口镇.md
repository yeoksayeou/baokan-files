Xinhua News Agency, Southern Guangxi Front, December 5th: Nanning (Yongning) City, an important town in southern Guangxi, was liberated on the 4th. The People's Liberation Army, advancing south from Liuzhou, after occupying Laibin, swiftly seized the Honghehai Bridge north of Qianjiang on the 1st of this month with a surprise attack, and quickly occupied Qianjiang, capturing over 400 enemy soldiers from the 82nd Division of the 97th Army, the 65th Division of the 14th Army, and a certain unit of the bandit Xiangjiang Column, and seizing 300 vehicles. On the 2nd, our army took advantage of the victory to liberate Binyang. The defeated bandits fled south in a panic. The People's Liberation Army followed closely, crossed the natural barrier of Kunlun Pass, and completely liberated Nanning at 8:00 PM on the 4th, seizing a large amount of military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shaanxi Front, December 5th: The People's Liberation Army on the Southern Shaanxi Front liberated Liuba County Town on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway on December 2nd, and occupied the strategically important Jiangkou Town northeast of the county on the 3rd.

Introduction to Nanning
Nanning, also known as Yongning, is located on the north bank of the Yu River. To the northeast, it is shielded by Kunlun Pass, with overlapping peaks and a strategic location. It has been a military stronghold since ancient times and is also the last nest of the Gui clique bandits entrenched in Guangxi. The city is the third largest city in Guangxi Province, after Guilin and Wuzhou. The urban area covers 90 square kilometers, with a total population of over 100,000. For twenty years before 1936, the capital of Guangxi Province was located here. Situated at the confluence of the Left and Right Rivers, it has convenient water and land transportation, making it the economic center of southern Guangxi. The import and export goods from the Left and Right River basins are mostly collected and distributed here.

　　我军越过天险昆仑关
  　解放桂南重镇南宁
    川陕公路上克留坝县城及江口镇
    【新华社华南前线五日电】桂南重镇南宁（邕宁）市已于四日解放。由柳州南下的人民解放军在占领来宾后，于本月一日以奔袭动作迅速抢占迁江以北的红河海桥，并迅即占领迁江，俘匪九十七军八十二师、十四军六十五师及匪湘江纵队某部四百余人，缴获汽车三百辆。二日，我军乘胜解放宾阳。溃匪狼狈南窜，解放军跟踪尾追，超过天险之昆仑关，于四日下午八时完全解放南宁，缴获军用物资极多。
    【新华社陕南前线五日电】陕南前线人民解放军于十二月二日解放川陕公路上的留坝县城，并于三日占领该县东北江口镇要地。守敌均向南逃窜。
    南宁介绍
    南宁又名邕宁，位于郁江北岸，东北以昆仑关为屏障、峰峦重叠，形势险要，自古即为军事重镇，亦系桂系匪首盘踞广西的最后巢穴。该市为广西省内仅次于桂林、梧州之第三座大城，市区面积九十平方公里，全市人口十余万，一九三六年以前之二十年间广西省会均设于此。地当左、右两江之合流点，水陆交通便利，成为广西南部的经济中心，左右两江流域的出入口货物多由此地集散。
