Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: TASS, New York - The National Committee of the American Progressive Party held a meeting on the 3rd and 4th. The meeting formulated a congressional campaign platform (note that the US will hold elections for all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate next November) and passed a resolution calling on the United States to stop the "Cold War" and establish a policy of peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union. Committee members from twenty-four states attended the meeting.

The resolution on peace passed by the National Committee contains four programs: (1) To recommend the conclusion of a treaty stipulating that atomic weapons are illegal; (2) To immediately establish diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China; (3) To abolish current restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe; (4) The United States should propose the signing of a Four-Power Agreement, reaffirming the Potsdam Declaration, and opposing the establishment of armed forces in any occupied zone of Germany.

The resolution stated: "This program can ease the current tense situation and lay the foundation for a comprehensive solution to this situation. Each of these steps will safeguard our national security, promote our economic well-being, and contribute to the cause of world peace."

The resolution also pointed out: "Despite denials from Secretary of Defense Johnson and General Bradley (note: Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff), the countries of the North Atlantic Group are preparing to place a re-Nazified, re-militarized Germany in military preparations against the East." In order to prevent Germany from becoming a new battlefield again, Truman "must replace all American officials responsible for allowing the Nazi cartel bosses to regain power, eliminate anti-Semitism in the West German occupation zone, and fulfill the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the eradication of German industrial cartels."

In a resolution elaborating the Progressive Party's position on issues that the next session of Congress must address, the National Committee of the Progressive Party expressed its willingness to cooperate with other groups to abolish the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act, increase unemployment benefits, continue and strengthen rent control, abolish income taxes on those with small incomes, and strive to formulate other laws to improve the situation of the working masses.

Another resolution accused the prosecution and sentencing of Communist leaders of violating constitutional rights and becoming "a serious threat to the freedom of all Americans."

The National Committee has decided to launch a mass movement to raise $250,000 as party operating funds, especially as operating funds for future congressional campaigns.

The American Progressive Party will hold its second National Congress in Chicago on February 24, 25, and 26 of next year.

　　美进步党制订国会竞选纲领
  　主张对苏合作
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国进步党全国委员会于三、四两日举行会议，会议制订了国会竞选（按美国将于明年十一月改选全体众议员及三分之一参议员）的纲领，并通过了决议案，要求美国停止“冷战”，建立与苏联和平合作的政策。出席会议的有来自二十四个州的委员会委员们。
    全国委员会所通过的关于和平的决议案有四项纲领：（一）建议缔结规定原子武器为非法的条约；（二）立即与中华人民共和国建立外交和贸易关系；（三）取消目前与苏联及东欧人民民主国家贸易上的限制；（四）美国应建议签订四强协定，重申波茨坦宣言，反对在德国任何占领区建立武装部队。
    该决议案声称：“这个纲领可以缓和目前的紧张情势，并奠定全盘解决这种情势的基础。这些步骤中的每一项，都将保障我们的国家安全，促进我们的经济福利，并有助于世界和平的事业。”
    该决议案并指出：“尽管有国防部长詹逊及布莱德雷将军（按系美国联合参谋部主席）的否认，北大西洋集团诸国正在准备把重新纳粹化的、重新军国主义化的德国安置在反对东方的军事准备中。”为了阻止德国再度变为新的战场，杜鲁门“必须撤换所有应对准许纳粹的卡迭尔老板们重获权力负责的美国官员们，肃清西德占领区的反犹太主义，并履行波茨坦协定中国关于铲除德大工业卡迭尔组织的规定”。
    在阐述进步党对国会下届会议所必须解决的诸问题的立场的决议案中，进步党全国委员会表示愿与其他团体合作，争取废除反劳工的塔失脱——哈特莱法，增加失业津贴，继续实行并加强房租管制，取消对微小收入者所课的所得税，以及争取制订其他法律，以改进劳苦大众的情况。
    另一项决议案指责对共产党领袖们的起诉与判决，违反宪法的权利，并成为“对所有美国人的自由的严重威胁”。
    全国委员会已决定发起群众运动，募捐二十五万美元，作为党的活动经费，尤其作为未来国会竞选方面的活动经费。
    美国进步党将于明年二月二十四、二十五及二十六日三天，在芝加哥举行第二次全国代表大会。
