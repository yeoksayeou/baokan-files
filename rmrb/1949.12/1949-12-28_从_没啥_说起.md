　　Starting with "Nothing Much"
    Tian Feng

    One day, the workers at the Qinhuangdao City Kailuan Wharf were holding a study group meeting. As the meeting was about to end, a worker received a local workers' newspaper and casually handed it to me. I only glanced at the headline and put it down. A worker asked me, "Comrade! Any good news?" I casually said, "Nothing much!" Another worker picked it up and found a report about their "gang" being temporarily transferred from the school to load ships the day before. He happily read it aloud. It turned out that they were loading soybeans and glass. Under the slogan of "Handle with Care" proposed by all the workers in the gang, they achieved an unprecedented result: they loaded quickly, stacked neatly, with only one bag of the 1,200 tons of soybeans damaged, and none of the 1,700 boxes of glass broken. At the same time, there was also a letter from the staff of the Yaohua Glass Factory to the workers of the Kailuan Wharf, praising their new attitude towards work and highlighting the noble spirit of the working class. The workers listened and applauded with joy.

    This brilliant achievement, which broke previous records and was produced with a new attitude towards labor, emerged from the awakened workers under the leadership of the Communist Party after liberation. The workers were all proud of it, but I almost dismissed the workers' enthusiasm with the words "nothing much" due to my carelessness. After reflection, I felt very ashamed.

    This made me think of two things: First, we must help others to progress at all times and in all places, and not lightly let go of any opportunities. The so-called "capitalize on the situation," "strike while the iron is hot," and "keep up with the times" all mean this. Because seizing the present to act is more effective than "knocking on the door for an audience" or "rushing to speak" when he doesn't want to listen and you force him to listen. This is not to say that we don't need positive leadership, but only lateral explanations. But being able to use opportunities, seize the present, and play a role in inspiration and promotion is a direct and powerful method. Second, newspapers are our guide for work and study. The news reports inside clearly tell us the experiences, methods, and directions. We must read them carefully and not be negligent. It is wrong to only look at the headlines when the newspaper is in hand. When you are reading the newspaper, and someone asks you, answering casually with "nothing much" often gives others the impression of ignoring the influence of the newspaper. Also, when some people talk about a policy, they say they don't know because they don't understand it, but it has already been published extensively in the newspaper, but they didn't pay attention to it. Saying you don't know when you don't know is still good, but even worse are those who usually don't study carefully, and with a smattering of knowledge, make far-fetched and nonsensical statements, which is an irresponsible attitude towards the people.

　　从“没啥”说起
    田风
    有一天，秦皇岛市开滦码头工人开学习小组会，当会议要结束的时候，一个工友接到了一份本市的工人报，随手递给我，我只将大字标题扫了一眼就放下了。一个工友问我：“同志！有啥好消息？”我随便说了一声“没啥！”另一个工友拿起来一看，就找到了他们那个“帮”在前天临时由学校调出去装船的报导，他高兴地念起来，原来是他们装大豆和玻璃，在全帮工友提出“快拿轻放”的口号下，造成装的快、排的整齐，一千二百吨大豆只坏了一包，一千七百箱玻璃没碎一箱的空前成绩。同时还登着一篇耀华玻璃厂职工给开滦码头工友的一封信，赞扬他们的工作新态度，发挥了工人阶级的高尚作风。工友们听了，都欢喜的鼓起掌来。
    这个打破以往记录，以新的劳动态度产生的辉煌成绩，是解放后的工人，在共产党领导下有了觉悟才出现的。工友们都引以为荣，但被我一时马虎，差点拿“没啥”两字抹煞了工友们的热情，事后检讨起来，惭愧得很。
    由此，使我联想到两个问题：第一，要随时随地帮助别人进步，有了机会就不可轻轻放过。所谓“因势利导”、“趁热”、“赶趟儿”，就是这个意思。因为抓住现实去做，比那“叩门求见”、“上赶着”，他不听你偏要讲给他勉强听的，要收事半功倍之效。——这不等于说不用正面的领导，而只用侧面的解释了。但能利用机会，抓住现实，起启发与推动的作用，那是直接而有力的办法。第二，报纸是指导我们工作学习的，里边的通讯报导，明确的告诉给我们经验办法和方向，我们要仔细的读，不可轻忽。如果报纸到手，只看看标题，是不对的。当你看报时，别人问一声，随口以“没啥”做回答，常会给别人以忽视报纸的影响。又如有的人谈起话来，对一个政策不了解，他说不知道，其实报上早已大书特书的登过了，但他没有注意看。不知道就说不知道还是好的，更有的人平时既不细心钻研，一知半解，就牵强附会的乱说一阵，更是对人民不负责任的态度了。
