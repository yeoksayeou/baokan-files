　　The Path of a Scientist
    Introducing the Soviet Film "Academician Ivan Pavlov"
    Xiao Fang
    The theme of "Academician Ivan Pavlov" is to illustrate the correct relationship between science and politics: science has class character and is subordinate to politics. Scientists cannot be detached from politics. This film clearly tells us that there are two paths before scientists: one is the path of light, where scientists combine with the people and serve the people; only in this way can science truly develop and scientists realize their beautiful ideals. The other is the reactionary path, where scientists become lackeys and accomplices of imperialist fascists, using scientific technology to kill people. There is no third path; it is impossible for scientists to shut themselves up, ignore politics, and bury themselves in science for the sake of science.

    "Academician Ivan Pavlov" uses the transformation of Professor Mi, an Estonian botanist, to illustrate this point. Professor Mi is a man who shuts himself up and buries himself in research work. He firmly believes that science has nothing to do with politics; even when his motherland is ravaged by German fascists, he does not care at all, but still buries himself in the laboratory day and night, pursuing his "ideal." However, although he is willing to shut himself up and not ask about politics, the door cannot be closed. German fascists finally broke in violently, searching for Estonian patriotic anti-German elements.

    As the heroic Soviet Red Army was about to liberate Estonia from the German fascists, Professor Mi's eldest son, born to his ex-wife and separated from his family for thirteen years, returned. He is also a "scientist," but he uses science to help the German fascists massacre Estonian people imprisoned in concentration camps. He agrees with and encourages Professor Mi to close the door even tighter, not to have any relationship with politics, and not to unite with the people. Therefore, Professor Mi still considers him the only one who understands him.

    Estonia was finally liberated by the Soviet Red Army, and the people were celebrating their liberation. But Professor Mi became troubled because his daughter actually opened the door and lent the hall to the Red Army as a wounded soldiers' hospital; and among the wounded soldiers, he discovered his student Deng De, whom he considered a young man of genius and promise. He was angry, he hated war, and even hated why the Soviet Red Army had to pursue the German fascists. When Deng answered him, "It is for the sake of ideals that we are fighting," he became even more angry. He said: I don't care what your ideals are, but I still want to pursue my scientific "ideal."

    Professor Mi's youngest son joined the army to completely defeat the enemy, and his wife and daughter went to university because they no longer wanted to stay in the isolated world behind the closed door. After Professor Mi sent his wife and daughters away, he prepared to go home and work "quietly" alone. He was even unwilling to accept the Soviet invitation to publish his research results and his plan to drain the swamps and turn them into fertile fields. On the way home, he saw the people of his motherland enthusiastically sending off their warriors. Suddenly, explosives planted by bandits exploded, and many good people were killed and injured. Professor Mi became even more troubled and cursed the cruelty of war.

    Back at home, in his eldest son's room, he discovered a large amount of American dollars, gold teeth pulled from people's mouths, and explosives. It turned out that his eldest son, this traitor to the nation, immediately found a new master, the United States, after the failure of the German fascists, and continued to carry out anti-people and anti-motherland conspiracies. Professor Mi was shocked, he recognized who was cruel, and he recognized why peace-loving people wanted to eliminate war with war.

    When his eldest son tried to kill his father to prevent the secret from being revealed, the Red Army rescued Professor Mi. Under the education of reality, Professor Mi recognized the task of a scientist, and he resolutely decided to dedicate his research results to the people. He wanted to drain the swamps and turn them into fertile fields. He opened the long-closed windows, looked at the distant swamps, and looked forward to the near future when a sea of ​​grain would appear, and then his ideal would truly be realized.

　　科学家的道路
    介绍苏联电影“卫城记”
    小方
    “卫城记”的主题是说明科学与政治的正确关系，科学是有阶级性的，是服从于政治的，科学家不能超然于政治之外。这部电影明确地告诉我们，放在科学家面前的是两条道路：一条是的光明的道路，是科学家与人民结合，为人民服务；而只有这样，科学才能得到真正的发展，科学家才能实现他美好的理想。另一条是反动的道路，是科学家做帝国主义法西斯的走狗和帮凶，用科学的技术来杀害人民。第三条道路是没有的，科学家要想关起大门来，不管政治，埋头为科学而科学是不可能的。
    “卫城记”用爱沙尼亚植物学家米教授的转变来说明这个问题。米教授是一个关起大门来埋头于研究工作的人，他深信科学与政治无关；甚至在祖国被德国法西斯蹂躏的时候，他也毫不关心，仍然日以继夜的钻在研究室里，追求着他的“理想”。但是，他虽然愿意关起大门来不问政治，大门却是关不住的。德国法西斯终于用暴力破门而入，以搜索爱沙尼亚的爱国抗德分子。
    在英勇的苏联红军将要从德国法西斯手中解放爱沙尼亚的时候，米教授前妻所生的、离家已十三年的大儿子回来了。他也是一个“科学家”，但是他却把科学用在替德国法西斯残杀被关在集中营里的爱沙尼亚人民。他附和并且怂恿米教授把大门关得更紧，不要和政治发生关系，不要和人民结合。因此，米教授还认为他是唯一理解自己的人。
    爱沙尼亚终于被苏联红军解放了，人民在欢庆着自己的翻身。但米教授却烦恼起来，因为他的女儿竟打开了大门，把大厅借给红军作伤兵医院；而在伤兵中他又发现了他的学生邓德，他认为是有天才有前途的青年。他愤怒，他恨战争，甚至恨苏联红军为什么还要追击德国法西斯。当邓回答他“是为了理想而战争”时，他更生气了，他说：我不管你们的理想是什么，但我却还要追求我科学的“理想”。
    米教授的小儿子为了彻底打垮敌人而从军去了，他的妻子和女儿为了不愿再留在与外界隔绝的大门里而上大学念书了。米教授送走妻女以后，准备回家一个人“安静”地工作，甚至连苏维埃邀请他发表他研究的结果，怎样吸干沼泽而使其变成良田的计划，他也不愿意。回家的途中，他看到了祖国的人民正在热烈地欢送着他的的战士。突然，匪徒们安置的炸药爆炸了，许多善良的人民被炸死、炸伤。米教授更烦恼，更咀咒战争的残酷。
    回到家里，在他大儿子的屋子里，他发现了大量的美金，从人嘴里拔下来的金牙和炸药。原来他的大儿子，这民族的叛徒，在德国法西斯失败之后，立刻就找了新主子美国，继续进行着反人民反祖国的阴谋活动。米教授惊悟了，他认识了谁是残酷的，他认识了爱好和平的人民为什么要以战争消灭战争。
    当他大儿子为了秘密的泄露而要杀死他父亲时，红军把米教授救了出来。在现实的教育下，米教授认清了科学家的任务，他毅然地要把他的研究成果献给人民。他要吸干沼泽，使它变成良田。他打开了久闭的窗户，望着远远的沼泽，憧憬着不久的将来，一片谷物的海洋将要出现，那时候，他的理想就真正实现了。
