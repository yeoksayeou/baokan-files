　　Shen Junru's Speech
　　The Victory of the Chinese People's Revolution Found Truth in the Soviet Union
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st】Shen Junru, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered a speech at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's General Assembly celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin today, which read in part:

　　Today is the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin, the leader of the people of our great friendly nation, the Soviet Union.

　　All Chinese people celebrate this great event with boundless excitement and joy.

　　Marshal Stalin is the leader of the Soviet people, the leader of the world's proletariat, and the mentor of all mankind.

　　In one-sixth of the earth's landmass, he destroyed the irrational system of man exploiting man, established a rational and happy socialist society, and from there entered a communist society. This great revolutionary cause has set an example for the people of the world. All oppressed, exploited, and enslaved nations must take the Soviet Union as a model, and with full confidence and courage, overthrow the oppressors above them and seek their own complete liberation.

　　The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the best proof. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, the Chinese people found the truth from the Russians, that is, from Lenin and Stalin. Without the October Revolution, without the assistance of the socialist Soviet Union, without the enlightenment of the great revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, it would have been unimaginable for the Chinese people to overthrow internal and external oppressors and achieve such a glorious victory as they have today.

　　Today, with the birth of New China and the great liberation of 475 million people, we cannot but deeply thank this great liberator of mankind, Marshal Stalin.

　　Now that New China has been born, and the Chinese people have been liberated, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, representing all 475 million of us Chinese people, is having a historic meeting with Marshal Stalin in Moscow. I believe that from today onwards, China and the Soviet Union will cooperate as brothers forever, and the people of China and the Soviet Union will always be friendly and inseparable. The two great powers of China and the Soviet Union will jointly strive for world peace and human happiness.

　　For the welfare of the Chinese people, for the permanent friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and for the peace and happiness of all the people in the world, I would like to wish Marshal Stalin a happy 70th birthday and wish him good health!

　　Long live Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people and the mentor of all mankind!

　　沈钧儒演说
    中国人民革命的胜利是从苏联找到了真理
    【新华社北京二十一日电】中苏友好协会总会副会长沈钧儒今日在中苏友好协会总会庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰大会上发表演说，略称：
    今天是我们伟大友邦苏联的人民领袖斯大林大元帅七十诞辰。
    我们全中国人民以无限兴奋无比欢悦的心情来庆贺这一件大喜事。
    斯大林大元帅是苏联人民的领袖，也是全世界无产阶级的领导者，全世界人类的导师。
    他在地球上六分之一的土地内，摧毁了人剥削人的不合理制度，建立了合理的幸福的社会主义社会，并由此进入共产主义社会。这一伟大的革命事业，对于全世界人民起了示范作用。一切被压迫被剥削被奴役的民族都要以苏联作为模范，以充分的信心和勇气，推翻他们头上的压迫者，求得自身的彻底解放。
    中国人民革命的胜利，就是最好的一个证明。诚如毛泽东主席所说，中国人民是从俄国人找到了真理，也就是从列宁斯大林找到了真理。没有十月革命，没有社会主义苏联的援助，没有马、恩、列、斯的伟大的革命理论的启示，中国人民要想推翻内外压迫者，获得象今天那样的辉煌的胜利，简直是不可想象的。
    在新中国诞生，四万万七千五百万人获得大翻身的今天，我们不能不深切感谢这位伟大的人类解放者斯大林大元帅。
    现在新中国已经诞生，中国人民已经翻身，中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席，代表了我们全中国四万万七千五百万人正在莫斯科和斯大林大元帅作历史性的会见。我相信从今天以后，中苏两国要象兄弟一般永远亲密合作，中苏人民永远友好无间。中苏两大国共同为世界和平人类幸福而努力奋斗。
    为了中国人民的福利，为了中苏两国间的永久友好，并为了全世界的人民的和平幸福，我谨祝斯大林大元帅的七十大寿，并谨祝他的健康！
    苏联人民的领袖，全人类的导师斯大林万岁！
