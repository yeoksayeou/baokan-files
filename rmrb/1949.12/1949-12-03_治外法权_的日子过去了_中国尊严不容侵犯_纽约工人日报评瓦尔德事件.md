Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 2nd. The New York Worker's Daily published an editorial on November 25th commenting on the case of Wald being expelled from the country for gathering a crowd to violently beat Chinese workers. The editorial first pointed out: The U.S. State Department is furious and ranting about the trial, imprisonment, and expulsion of U.S. Consul in Shenyang, Wald, and his entourage from China. The commander of the American Legion demanded the immediate dispatch of troops, battleships, and atomic bombs to China to avenge this "insult." The editorial said, but think about the incident that triggered this scandal. Wald, an "old China hand," could not shake off the habits cultivated by his kind during their century-plus rule over China. So, when his employees demanded the wages owed to them, Wald became angry and started beating the workers. The editorial pointed out that Wald and the State Department are not accustomed to one fact: China is no longer a place to exploit cheap labor, nor is it a place where you can hire "Chinese coolies" for a few cents and abuse and manipulate them at will. They refuse to face one fact: this ancient country has finally regained its dignity, the days of "extraterritoriality" are over, and China demands that its people and laws receive the same respect that every country is entitled to.

　　“治外法权”的日子过去了
   　中国尊严不容侵犯 
     纽约工人日报评瓦尔德事件
    【新华社布拉格二日电】纽约工人日报十一月二十五日发表社论评瓦尔德聚众凶殴中国工人被驱逐出境案。社论首先指出：美国国务院对美国驻沈阳领事瓦尔德及其随员们被审讯、被禁锢和被驱逐出中国一事，怒气冲冲，大发脾气，而且破口谩骂。美国退伍军人团团长要求立即派遣军队、主力舰及原子弹至中国，为这个“污辱”报仇。社论说，但想一想触发这场现丑的事件吧。“老中国通”瓦尔德抛不开他们那一流人在一百多年对华统治期间中所养成的习惯。所以，当他的雇员们要求发给拖欠他们的工薪时，瓦尔德发怒了，于是动手殴击工人们。社论指出，瓦尔德和国务院对一项事实感到不习惯，这项事实就是：中国已不再是一个剥削廉价劳动的地方了，也不是再花几文钱就可以雇用“中国小子们”并任意虐待和任意摆布他们的地方了。他们拒绝面对一项事实，就是：这个古老的国家已终于重新获得它的尊严，“治外法权”的日子已经过去，中国要求它的人民和法律受到每一个国家都有权享有的同样的尊重。
