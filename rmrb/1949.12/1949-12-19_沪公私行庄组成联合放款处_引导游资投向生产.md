　　Shanghai Public and Private Banks and Financial Houses Establish Joint Lending Facility
　　Guiding Idle Capital Towards Production
[Shanghai News] To guide idle capital towards production and to facilitate loans for manufacturers in Shanghai, Shanghai's public banks, private banks, money shops, and trust companies jointly established the "Shanghai Public-Private Financial Industry Joint Lending Facility" on the 14th of this month. The People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch was elected as the chairman of the Joint Lending Facility Committee to conduct production loans, with a total loan amount tentatively set at 12 billion Renminbi. The loan targets are not limited to any particular industry, but the funds must be used for production purposes. The loan term is 60 days per loan, and the interest rate will be calculated at 90% of the average daily lending rate quoted by the Financial Industry Committee (subject to negotiation between both parties), with settlement and payment every ten days. The organization of this joint lending facility, with the participation of public banks, has resulted in an unprecedented increase in capital strength. To address the difficulties faced by private banks, money shops, and trust companies due to tight credit and reduced deposits, the People's Bank has specially authorized the participating banks and financial houses to request short-term borrowing, four times a month, for three days each time.
