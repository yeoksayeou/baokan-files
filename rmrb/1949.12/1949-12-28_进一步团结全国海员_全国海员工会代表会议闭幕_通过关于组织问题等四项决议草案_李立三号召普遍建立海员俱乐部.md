Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th: The National Seamen's Union Representative Conference, lasting ten days, concluded today. An important achievement of this conference was the adoption of four draft resolutions concerning organizational issues, the issue of collective contracts, the establishment of seamen's clubs and the publication of seamen's journals, and the issue of training seamen's union cadres, as well as a draft proposal for organizing private shipping companies, which will be submitted to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for review and approval.

At the final meeting held this afternoon, Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke. He considered this conference a success. He pointed out that establishing seamen's clubs is one of the important methods of organizing seamen workers, and should be universally established in various regions. Organizing private shipping companies is a good way to organize private ship workers to develop shipping, and this type of organization can be gradually promoted in various regions based on the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke in detail on the relationship between Chinese seamen and the international workers' movement. Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that Chinese seamen have a glorious history and an unlimited future, and they will play a significant role in China's future construction. Chen Yu, an old seamen worker leader and current Minister of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, also spoke at the meeting. Liu Zijiu, Director of the Culture and Education Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his final speech that the main task of the Seamen's Union next year is to unite seamen across the country, practice thrift, overcome difficulties, strengthen transportation, and assist the People's Liberation Army in liberating Hainan Island and Taiwan.

At this point, Liu Lianchao, Director of the Seamen's Work Committee, announced the closing of the meeting. After the meeting, representatives from the Central China Shipping Administration Bureau, the Wuhan Seamen's Union, and the Northern Anhui Region Seamen's Union presented flags to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

    【新华社北京二十七日电】中华全国海员工会代表会议，历时十天，已于今日结束。这次会议的重要成就是通过了关于组织问题、订立集体合同问题、设立海员俱乐部和出版海员刊物、训练海员工会干部问题等四项决议草案，及组织民船运输公司的建议草案，将提请中华全国总工会审查批准。
    今日下午举行的最后一次会议上，中华全国总工会副主席李立三讲话。他认为这次会议是成功的。他指出：建立海员俱乐部是组织海员工人的重要方法之一，各地可普遍建立。组织民船运输公司是组织民船工人发展航运的好办法，各地可根据自愿两利的原则，逐渐推广此种组织。全国总工会副主席刘宁一亦就中国海员与国际职工运动的关系问题讲述甚详。全国总工会副主席朱学范讲话时指出中国海员是有光荣历史的，前途是无限的，他们将在中国未来建设中发挥重大的作用。老海员工人领袖现任中央人民政府燃料部部长陈郁亦在会上讲话。全国总工会文教部长刘子久于最后讲话时指出：明年海员工会的主要任务，是把全国海员团结起来，厉行节约，克服困难，加强运输，协助人民解放军解放琼崖和台湾。
    至此，海员工作委员会主任刘连潮宣布：会议闭幕。会后，华中航政局、武汉市海员工会和皖北区海员工会代表向中华全国总工会献旗。
