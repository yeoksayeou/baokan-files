　　The Correct Understanding of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds
    Wang Sishu
    In order to support the People's Liberation War, rapidly unify the country, facilitate stable livelihoods, and embark on the path of economic recovery and development; and also to overcome some of the expected financial difficulties in 1950, the Central People's Government Committee passed the "Decision on Issuing the People's Victory Indexed Bonds" at its fourth meeting on December 2nd. The Government Administration Council has already passed and promulgated the "Regulations on the First Phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds".
    The financial difficulties of the People's Government are the common difficulties of all the people of the People's Republic of China. These difficulties can be overcome as long as the people of the whole country contribute money and effort in accordance with the methods determined by the government. Issuing victory bonds is for the benefit of all the people, so this is everyone's business. We must recognize that buying bonds is not only to solve the difficulties of others, nor is it only to solve the difficulties of the government, but to solve our common difficulties, and for our common future interests. It is incorrect to regard the issuance of People's Victory Bonds as a purely lending relationship, to regard the People's Government as a mere borrower, and for bond purchasers to regard themselves as mere creditors.
    The issuance of People's Victory Indexed Bonds is to use the people's funds to solve the people's common difficulties and seek the people's common welfare, but in the form of issuing bonds; but it is completely different in nature from the bonds issued by the past reactionary regimes. Another feature of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds is the protection of the interests of bond purchasers. Because of the indexed issuance, it not only guarantees the value of the principal, but also guarantees the value of the interest. It enables bond purchasers to not only suffer no losses when recovering the principal, but also to obtain the prescribed interest every year before recovering the principal.
    The prices of the four kinds of physical objects that make up a "share" are calculated using a weighted average method based on the wholesale prices of the six major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, which is very reasonable. This allows people scattered in various regions to purchase victory bonds at reasonable and unified prices.
    The total amount of victory bonds issued is 200 million shares, with an annual interest rate of 5%, to be repaid in five years. 10% of the total amount will be redeemed in the first year, and then increased by 5% each year. The first phase of 100 million shares has been scheduled to be issued on January 5, 1950, and the repayment schedule for the first phase has been announced. Referring to this repayment schedule, it can be inferred that the repayment of principal and interest for the total amount of 200 million shares of victory bonds in the years after 1950 will be roughly as follows (unit: shares):
Year　　　　　　　Current Balance　　Redemption Amount　
　　Interest Payment　　　　Principal and Interest Total
1951　200,000,000　20,000,000　10,000,000　30,000,000
1952　180,000,000 30,000,000　9,000,000　39,000,000
1953　150,000,000 40,000,000 7,500,000 47,500,000
1954　110,000,000 50,000,000 5,500,000 55,500,000
1955　60,000,000　60,000,000　3,000,000　63,000,000
Total　　　　　　　　　200,000,000 35,000,000　235,000,000

    The method of repaying principal and interest for the People's Victory Indexed Bonds is practical and feasible. In 1950, the government received 200 million shares from the issuance of bonds, smoothly overcoming the most difficult period in finance. By 1951, as the financial situation gradually improved, it would not be difficult to pay 30 million shares of principal and interest. In the years after that, the government's financial revenue and expenditure will improve even more, and the gradual redemption will be no problem. This is something that everyone can acknowledge.
    In the past, the Chinese people recognized that the bonds issued by the reactionary regime increased the burden on the people, because the bonds issued by the reactionary regime were for the benefit of the four major families, and there was no guarantee of the principal and interest for bond purchasers, or the depreciation of currency affected the depreciation of bond values, causing losses to bond purchasers. Now, the People's Victory Indexed Bonds are the People's Government borrowing money from the people for the benefit of the people, and using it for the benefit of the people, redeeming principal and interest in installments, and guaranteeing the value of the principal and interest. For bond purchasers, this is equivalent to long-term indexed savings, and the principal and interest can be fully recovered later. From the time of purchasing the bonds, it does increase the burden, but from a long-term perspective, it is not a burden.
    When the total amount of 200 million shares of victory bonds is paid off, the People's Government will pay a total of 35 million shares in interest. This is borne by the people of the whole country, and it is also the profit that bond purchasers deserve.
    If the issued bonds are purchased by the national population on an average basis, and the interest is borne by the national people on an average basis, then it becomes a value-preserving, interest-free loan. In fact, this hypothetical situation is impossible. The reason why bond purchasers can actually receive interest is because others are paying interest. Among the people of the whole country, some people have the ability to purchase bonds, while others, although willing to purchase, do not have the ability. In the interest actually received by the former, the latter bears a portion. For example, farmers in the old liberated areas made the greatest contributions in the Liberation War by providing manpower, food, and money, and in the current burden situation, they have little ability to purchase victory bonds; while industrialists and businessmen in the cities have the ability to purchase victory bonds, and can receive interest every year before recovering the principal. A portion of this interest is borne by the farmers in the old liberated areas. Moreover, the transfer of the burden portion, so it is not without burden. In order to overcome the common difficulties of the people, interest is an encouragement to bond purchasers. This is correct, necessary, and beneficial. The 35 million shares of interest are borne by all the people in five years starting from 1951, and the burden per person per year is negligible, and the intangible gains will greatly exceed this very slight burden. However, from the perspective of bond purchasers, since their purchase of bonds is to overcome their own and everyone's common difficulties, and to seek common interests, they pay a sum of funds, recover a fixed amount of interest every year, and recover the value unchanged in one to five years. And another part of the people bear the interest on the bonds for the same goal. Compared with this, can he still say he is "losing out"? Only those who engage in improper financial business, such as lending at high interest rates or speculating, will think that victory bonds are a loss, and this idea is certainly wrong. It would be too short-sighted for people engaged in legitimate business to have this idea, or to emphasize their own difficulties.
    "The main target of the issuance of victory bonds is the industrial and commercial circles in the cities. They did not have the opportunity to contribute to the Liberation War in the past, and this is an opportunity for them to make a good performance. Of course, some people in the industrial and commercial circles may feel some financial difficulties in purchasing victory bonds, but in order to overcome the great difficulties of the country, that is, for their own long-term interests in the future, they should try their best to purchase more victory bonds. Everyone has the obligation to try their best to purchase bonds. We should work together not only to ensure that the total amount of victory bonds is reached as scheduled, but also to exceed the predetermined amount."

　　对人民胜利折实公债应有的认识
    王思曙
    为了支援人民解放战争，迅速统一全国，以利安定民生，走上恢复和发展经济的轨道；同时也为了克服一部分预期中的一九五○年中的财政困难，中央人民政府委员会于十二月二日第四次会议中通过了“发行人民胜利折实公债的决定”，政务院已于日前通过并公布了“一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债条例”。
    人民政府财政上的困难，是中华人民共和国全体人民的共同困难。这种困难，只要全国人民按照政府所定办法出钱出力，是可以克服的。发行胜利公债，是为着全体人民的利益，因此，这是属于大家的事情。我们必须认识，购买公债，并不单是为了解决别人的困难，也不单是为了解决政府的困难，而是为了解决我们大家共同的困难，是为了我们大家共同的未来利益。倘使把发行人民胜利公债看作纯粹的借贷关系，把人民政府看作单纯的借债者，购买公债人把自己看作单纯的债权人，是不对的。
    发行人民胜利折实公债，是利用人民的资金，解决人民共同的困难，谋人民共同的福利，不过采取的是发行公债的方式；但与过去反动政权所发行的公债，本质上是完全不同的。人民胜利折实公债的另一特点，是对公债购买人利益的保障。因为折实发行，不但保障本额的价值，而且保障利息的价值。使公债购买人在收回本额时，不但毫无损失，而且在收回本额前每年取得规定的利息。
    组成“分”的四种实物的价格，以上海、天津、汉口、西安、广州、重庆六大城市的批发价，用加权平均法计算，是非常合理的，这使得分散在各地区的人民，可以照合理的统一的价格，购买胜利公债。
    胜利公债发行总额二万万分，年息五厘，分五年偿还。第一年抽还总额的百分之十，以后每年递增百分之五。第一期一万万分已定于一九五○年一月五日开始发行，第一期的还本付息表已公布。参照该还本付息表，可推断胜利公债总额二万万分的还本付息，在一九五○年以后的各年度大致如下表（单位分）年　　　　　　　现负数　　　还本数　
　　付息数　　　　本息共数一九五一　二00．000．000　二0．000．000　一0．000．000　三0．000．000一九五二　一八0．000．000 三0．000．000　九．000．000　三九．000．000一九五三　一五0．000．000 四0．000．000 七．五00．000 四七．五00．000一九五四　一一0．000．000 五0．000．000 五．五00．000 五五．五00．000一九五五　六0．000．000　六0．000．000　 三．000．000　六三．000．000总　　　　　　计　　 二00．000．000 三五．000．000　二三五．000．000
    人民胜利折实公债的还本付息办法，是切实可行的。在一九五○年中政府收入了公债发行额二万万分，顺利地度过了财政上最困难的时期，到一九五一年，因财政状况的逐渐改善，付出三千万分的本息，是不会有困难的。以后每年财政收支更有进步，逐年抽还，毫无问题。这是任何人都能承认的。
    过去国人认识到反动政权所发行的公债是增加人民的负担，是因为反动政权发行的公债；为了四大家族的利益，对公债购买人的本利毫无保障，或者因通货贬值，影响公债票额贬值，使公债购买人受到损失。现在人民胜利折实公债既是人民政府为了人民的利益向人民借债，为了人民的利益而使用，分期抽还本息，保障本息币值。对公债购买人言，这等于长期的折实储蓄，以后本利完全可以收回；从购买公债时看，的确增加负担，从长期看，便不是负担。
    当胜利公债总额二万万分偿清的时候，人民政府共将付出利息三千五百万分。是由全国人民负担的，也是公债购买人应得的利润。
    假如发行的公债由全国人口平均分摊购买，而又由全国人民平均负担利息，那么，就变成保值的无利借贷。事实上，这假定的情况是不可能有的。公债购买人之得以实收利息，正是因为有别人付出利息。在全国人民中，一部分人民有能力购买公债，另一部分人民虽或愿意购，而没有能力，前者所实收的利息中，后者却是负担一部分的。例如老解放区的农民在解放战争中出人出粮出钱，作了最大的贡献，在现在的负担情况下，很少能力购买胜利公债；而城市中的工商业家，有能力购买胜利公债，在收回本额前每年能得到利息。这利息中，便有老解放区农民负担的一份。而且将负担部分的转嫁，所以并非没有负担。为了克服人民共同的困难，利息是对公债购买人的鼓励。这是正确的、必需的也是有益的。三千五百万分的利息由全体人民自一九五一年起分五年负担，每人每年负担无几，而无形的收获，必将大大超过这很轻微的负担，然而从公债购买人方面来说，他的购买公债既然为着克服他自己的和大家共同的困难，谋共同的利益来付出一笔资金，收回每年得到定额利息，在一年至五年后收回，价值不变。而另外一部分人为着同样的目标，负担着公债利息。相比之下，他还能说“吃亏”吗？只有经营不正当金融业务者如放高利贷或投机的，才会以为胜利公债是吃亏的，这种想法当然是错误的。从事正当业务的人们中如亦有作此想者，或强调本身困难，就未免太无远见了。
    “胜利公债发行的主要对象是城市中的工商界。他们过去对解放战争未有机会出力，这次是一机会，应作良好的表现。当然，若干工商界人士对购买胜利公债可能会感觉到资金上有若干困难，然而为了克服国家的大的困难，也即为了他们自己未来的长远利益，是应该竭力以最大努力设法多购胜利公债。尽力购买公债，大家都有义务。应共同努力，不但使胜利公债的发行总额如期达成，而且一定要超过预定的数额。”
