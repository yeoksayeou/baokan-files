The mother of a soldier who sacrificed himself for the liberation of the people of Yugoslavia said in a letter to Stalin: "I do not feel sad about my son's death, because he fought for the happiness of the people. But I curse the bandit Tito day and night, who not only betrayed the blood shed by my son, but also the blood shed by the sons of the Yugoslav people who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of their motherland. Tito wants to turn our motherland into his own colony, but thanks to you leading us and teaching us to be vigilant, we have been liberated from the oppression of Tito - the second Mussolini. We therefore thank you and the Bolshevik Party, and will always thank you and the Bolshevik Party."
