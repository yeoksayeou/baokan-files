　　Philosophy Teaching Symposium Held by Universities in Beijing and Tianjin
　　Reviewing Problems in Political Class Teaching
    [This newspaper's report] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the fifth symposium on the teaching of dialectical materialism and historical materialism on the 25th. Over a hundred professors, lecturers, and assistants from various universities in Beijing and Tianjin attended. Zhang Zonglin presided over the meeting. After reporting on the progress of teaching in various schools, Ai Siqi made a preliminary review of the political classes. He pointed out: In terms of organization, the establishment of new teaching organizations in various schools is an achievement. In terms of ideology, the incorrect views on political classes have been overcome, and the idea that the history of social development is not worth studying has been broken. It has been proven that accepting the labor viewpoint and the class viewpoint cannot be resolved merely by words, but is a struggle between old and new ideologies. The important experience in doing a good job in learning is that professors and assistants unite to jointly organize teaching, and that students should become a mass learning movement. To solve problems, one must be good at relying on activists and uniting the middle-of-the-road elements. He then pointed out that in the next stage of study, one should continue to solve the ideological problems of students that have not yet been clarified. When studying ideological consciousness, one should focus on connecting with one's own class background and analyzing the shortcomings caused by the long-term separation of intellectuals from labor. Materialism focuses on explaining that matter is primary and spirit is secondary, opposing idealism on the one hand and the old materialism that absolutely negates the role of spirit on the other. Dialectics focuses on explaining the erroneous ideological method of looking at problems one-sidedly without considering specific conditions. Then everyone discussed the issue of learning summaries, calling on schools to conduct learning summaries in various ways according to specific circumstances, such as group reviews and evaluations, as the conclusion of this course. He also put forward opinions on how to prepare for the political class (On New Democracy) in the next semester. The meeting adjourned at half past twelve.

　　京津各大学开哲学教学座谈会
　  检讨政治课教学问题
    【本报讯】中央人民政府教育部于二十五日召开第五次辩证唯物论与历史唯物论教学座谈会。到会京津各校教授、讲、助百余人，由张宗麟主持开会，报告各校教学进行情况后，由艾思奇对政治课作了初步检讨，他指出：在组织方面，各校建立了新的教学组织，是有成绩的。思想方面，克服了对政治课的不正确看法，打破了对社会发展史不值得一学的想头，证明接受劳动观点与阶级观点并非口头所能解决，而是新旧思想的斗争。搞好学习的重要经验，是教授讲助团结起来，共同组织教学，在学生方面要成为群众的学习运动，解决问题要善于依靠积极分子，团结中间状态的分子。继指出下一阶段学习仍应继续解决同学思想上尚未明确的问题，学习思想意识部分，应着重联系自己的阶级出身，分析知识分子长期脱离劳动所造成的缺点。唯物论着重说明物质第一，精神第二，一方面反对唯心论，另一面也反对绝对否定精神作用的旧唯物论。辩证法着重说明不考虑具体条件片面看问题的错误思想方法。继由大家讨论学习总结问题，号召各校按具体情况用各种方式，如小组检讨、鉴定等进行学习总结，作为本门课程的结束。对于下学期政治课（新民主主义论）也提出了应该如何准备的意见。会至十二时半始散。
