　　Indian and Iranian Representatives Speak at Asian Women's Conference
  　Chief Indian Representative Amrita Tavi
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th: Chief Indian Representative Amrita Tavi, when discussing the report "Asian Women's Struggle for National Independence, People's Democracy and World Peace" at the Asian Women's Conference today, stated:
    The Anglo-American war provokers, under the cover of their Indian lackeys, are desperately trying every means to turn India into a major base for aggressive war. As a result of the Indian government's betrayal of the people's interests, the material conditions of the masses are rapidly deteriorating. Taking 1939 as 100, the cost of living index has now increased by 310 to 508 percent, while actual wages have fallen to only 21 to 40 percent of the starvation wages of 1939. From 1939 to 1948, the average per capita consumption of food grains decreased from 388 pounds to 357 pounds, and the consumption of cloth decreased from 16 yards to 11 yards. Famine has already occurred in Bengal, Gujarat, and many parts of South India.
    The Indian people are waging a heroic struggle against the Nehru government, the lackeys of Anglo-American imperialism. In these struggles, women are as brave as other people. In West Bengal Province, where the democratic women's movement is particularly strong, at least 32 women have been sacrificed in demonstrations in the past few months. On April 27th, women held a demonstration demanding better treatment for political prisoners, and police shot and killed four women leaders on the spot. On September 9th, women and children held an anti-hunger demonstration, and police opened fire, killing ten women and two children. Marilyn Koodanarsen, an executive member of the Women's International Democratic Federation, is one of the most outstanding leaders of the women's movement in Bengal Province. This year, she and other arrested persons went on a three-month hunger strike.
    The strength of the Indian people and Indian women is great. They held a mass peace rally of 20,000 people in Bombay, and at that time, they donated 1,040 rupees from the working people as their contribution to the peace movement. In Calcutta, there was a torchlight parade of 2,000 people and a gathering of 6,000 people, shouting: "We stand with the defenders of peace!"
    The All-India Peace Conference held last month in heroic Calcutta under terrible persecution is a manifestation of the achievements of the struggle of the Indian people and Indian women.
    Nehru has exhausted all kinds of bloody methods to suppress the desire of Indian women and the people to stand in the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. However, the Indian people firmly believe that the existence of the Soviet Union is the guarantee of their ultimate victory. We also firmly believe that the victory of China has opened up the road to victory for all Asian people.
    Iranian Representative Maxine Farroqi
  　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th: The following is a summary of the speech given by Iranian representative Maxine Farroqi at the Asian Women's Conference this morning: Dear sisters:
    On behalf of the Iranian Democratic Women's League, I express my warm respect to the representatives and guests of the Asian Women's Conference, on behalf of the mothers and women of Iran.
    Chinese sisters, your struggle and your success, the establishment of your People's Republic of China, have brought infinite help to our common struggle. On behalf of the Iranian Democratic Women's League, I salute and thank you.
    For centuries, Iranian women and mothers have lived in hardship, enslaved by the feudal exploitative system; this system is further strengthened by the support of imperialism, which covets Iran's oil and natural resources. The struggle of Iranian women is, on the one hand, to liberate themselves from feudal exploitation, and on the other hand, to oppose Anglo-American colonialists and strive for national independence.
    The struggle of Iranian women before World War II
    Iranian women directly participated in the revolution of 1906, because Russia bordered Iran, so they were influenced by the Russian anti-tsarist revolution of 1905. This revolution established a constitution and overthrew feudal despotism. The success of women's organizations in 1918 marked a new stage in the struggle of Iranian women. However, this organized struggle was suffocated in 1931 by the fascist dictatorship established by British imperialism in Iran. The purpose of this dictatorship was to eliminate the Iranian people's liberation movement and turn Iran into a base of aggression in order to attack the first bastion of the world's workers and democratic forces – the Soviet Union.
    The struggle of Iranian women during World War II
    In September 1941, the Red Army and British troops entered Iran to carry out the anti-fascist struggle. The Iranian people breathed a sigh of relief, democratic leaders who had been imprisoned for several years were released, and democratic groups were revived. The Iranian Democratic Front united trade unions, the People's Party, women's and youth groups, and worked entirely for anti-fascism. In 1943, Iranian women united under the Iranian Democratic Women's League, and they carried out the struggle for equality, for improving their lives, and against dark forces and polygamy. They organized alongside their working-class brothers and intellectual brothers, carrying out demonstrations for everyone's rights to bread, freedom, work, education and hygiene.
    The struggle of women after World War II
    Thanks to the great victory of the Soviet Union, in the Azarbaijan province in northern Iran, the democratic movement liberated the entire province. For the first time, Iranian women gained political, economic, and social rights equal to those of men. But this initial victory was eventually suffocated by bayonets. Soon after the withdrawal of British and Red Army troops, American imperialists took control of Iran's economy and military power. Suppression and terror began to appear throughout Iran. Democratic groups, such as the Democratic Women's League, were persecuted, their magazines were confiscated, and millions of male and female workers and democrats (including the heads of the Democratic Women's League) were also imprisoned. The chairman of the Democratic Women's League, Miriyan Filu, has been sentenced to five years in prison.
    Regardless of suppression and terror, the struggle continues. Although the Democratic Women's League was slightly weakened for a time, it soon resumed its struggle. Since joining the Women's International Democratic Federation in September 1947, Iranian women no longer feel that their struggle is isolated and helpless.
    Dear sisters, the Iranian people know that imperialists want to turn Iran into a base of aggression, but we will use all our strength to oppose them. The Democratic Women's League continues to struggle underground. Although oppressed, two unofficial democratic newspapers have been published; magazines have been confiscated, but we use leaflets to replace them; although gatherings are prohibited, women speak out at religious gatherings.
    We ask you to more widely inform people of the truth about Iranian women, and at the same time protest to the Iranian government, asking the Iranian government to stop the brutal behavior in prisons; stop the arrest and abuse of women and children. We ask the Iranian government to release women and democrats; and recognize our group as a legal organization.

### 亚洲妇女代表会议上　印度伊朗代表发言

　　亚洲妇女代表会议上
  　印度伊朗代表发言
　　印度首席代表阿米塔·台维
    【新华社北京十一日电】印度首席代表阿米塔·台维，今日在亚洲妇女代表会议讨论“亚洲妇女为民族独立人民民主与世界和平而斗争”的报告时，发言称：
    英美战争挑拨者在他们的印度走狗的掩护下，正在不顾一切地想尽一切方法把印度变成为侵略战争的主要基地。印度政府出卖人民利益的结果，造成人民大众物质条件的迅速恶化。生活指数以一九三九年作为一百，则现在增加了百分之三百一十至五百零八，而实际工资已降低到只有一九三九年饥饿工资的百分之二十一至百分之四十。从一九三九年至一九四八年之间，每人的平均食粮消费量已由三百八十八磅减低到三百五十七磅，而布的消费量从十六码减低到十一码。饥荒已经在孟加拉、古兹拉特和南印度许多地方发生。
    印度人民为了反抗英美帝国主义走狗尼赫鲁政府，正在进行着英勇的斗争。在这些斗争中，妇女象其他人民一样勇敢，在民主妇女运动特别强大的西孟加拉省，过去几个月中，至少有三十二个妇女在示威游行中牺牲。今年四月二十七日妇女举行要求改善对政治犯待遇的示威，警察当场打死了四个妇女领袖。九月九日妇女及儿童举行反饥饿示威，警察开枪打死了十个妇女和两个小孩。国际民主妇联执行委员美林古达娜森是孟加拉省妇女运动最卓越的领袖之一，今年和其他被捕者一起进行了三个月的绝食斗争。
    印度人民和印度妇女的力量是伟大的。他们在孟买举行了二万人的群众和平大会，当时便从劳动人民中捐得了一千零四十卢布比作为他们对和平运动的贡献。在加尔各答有一个二千人的火炬游行，并有六千人的集会，他们高呼：“我们同和平保卫者站在一起！”
    上月全印和平大会在恐怖的迫害之下在英雄的加尔各答召开，就是印度人民同印度妇女斗争成绩的表现。
    尼赫鲁用尽各种血腥的方法压制印度妇女和人民站在以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的愿望。然而印度人民深信：苏联的存在，就是他们最终胜利的保证。我们也深信中国的胜利为一切亚洲人民开辟了走向胜利的道路。
    伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪
  　【新华社北京十一日电】伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪，今日上午在亚洲妇女代表会议上的发言，摘要如下：亲爱的姊妹们：
    我以伊朗民主妇女联合会的名义，代表伊朗的母亲和妇女们，向亚洲妇女代表会议的诸位代表们、来宾们表示热烈的敬意。
    中国的姊妹们，你们的斗争和你们的成功，你们中华人民共和国的建立，对于我们共同的斗争，带来了无限的帮助。我以伊朗民主妇女联合会的名义向你们致敬和感谢。
    若干世纪以来，伊朗的妇女和母亲们就在困苦之下生活，受着封建剥削制度的奴役；这种制度更被贪图伊朗的石油和天然富源的帝国主义支持而更加强了。伊朗妇女的斗争，是一方面要从封建剥削下解放出来，一方面是反对英美殖民主义分子，争取民族独立。
    二次世界大战以前伊朗妇女的斗争
    伊朗妇女是直接参加一九○六年的革命的，因为俄国同伊朗的国界毗邻，所以她们就受了一九○五年俄国反沙皇革命的影响。这一次的革命，成立了宪法，推翻了封建的专制主义。一九一八年妇女组织的成功，在伊朗妇女的斗争中，已标出了一个新的阶段。可是这一有组织的斗争，在一九三一年就被英帝国主义在伊朗所建立的法西斯独裁制窒息了。这种独裁的目的是在消灭伊朗人民的解放运动，把伊朗变成一个侵略基地，以便攻击全世界工人的和民主力量的第一堡垒——苏联。
    在二次民办大战中伊朗妇女的斗争
    一九四一年九月，红军和英国军队因进行反法西斯斗争而进入了伊朗。伊朗人民喘了一口气，被监禁了几年的民主领袖被释放了，民主团体复活起来。伊朗民主阵线联合了工会、人民党、妇女和青年团体完全作着反法西斯的工作。一九四三年，伊朗妇女在伊朗民主妇女联合会下团结起来了，她们进行着为平等、为改善生活的斗争，反对黑暗势力和多妻制度。她们在工人阶级兄弟及知识分子兄弟之旁组织起来，作着为大家的面包、自由、工作、教育和卫生的权利的示威运动。
    二次世界大战后的妇女斗争
    得力于苏联的伟大胜利，在伊朗北部亚吉巴查省，民主运动使全省获得了解放。伊朗妇女第一次获得了在政治上、经济上、社会上和男子平等的权利。但这初期的胜利，终于被刺刀窒息了。在英国军队和红军撤退后不久，美帝国主义者便把伊朗的经济、军事权都拿到手中。弹压、恐怖开始在全伊朗出现了。民主团体，如民主妇联都受了迫害，她们发行的杂志被扣留，数百万男女工人和民主人士（其中包括民主妇联的负责人），也关进了监牢。民主妇联的主席米里扬·非鲁，已被判处五年的监禁。
    不管弹压和恐怖，斗争仍然继续着。民主妇联虽一时稍被削弱，不久又重新恢复了斗争。一九四七年九月自从加入国际民主妇联以后，伊朗妇女就不再觉得她们的斗争是孤立无援了。
    亲爱的姊妹们，伊朗人民知道帝国主义要把伊朗变为侵略基地，但我们要用全力反对他们。民主妇联继续在地下斗争。虽然受着压迫，但两种不经官方批准的民主报纸也出版了；杂志被扣留，但我们用传单来代替；虽然集会被禁止，但妇女们在宗教集会上发表言论。
    我们要求你们更广泛地使人们了解伊朗妇女的真象，同时向伊朗政府提出抗议，要伊朗政府停止监牢中的残暴行为；停止对妇女和儿童们的逮捕和虐待。要伊朗政府释放妇女和民主人士；承认我们的团体为合法组织。
