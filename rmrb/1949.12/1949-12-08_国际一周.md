During the second half of November, the Cominform held its third meeting in Hungary, adopting three extremely important resolutions, which were announced on November 29. In its two major resolutions, "Defending Peace and Fighting War-Mongers" and "The Unity of the Working Class and the Tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties," the Cominform made a concrete and profound analysis of the current international situation, pointing out that the forces of peace and democracy have greatly surpassed the forces of reaction, and exposing the further weakening and incurable ills of imperialism. However, the resolutions also told all peace-loving and democratic people that they should never be complacent due to the great increase in their own strength, because "the more desperate the imperialist reactionaries are, the more疯狂 they become, and the greater the danger of military adventures." Therefore, the Cominform called on the communist and workers' parties of all countries to lead the broad masses of the working class to unite, and on the basis of further unity of the working class, to realize the great unity of all democratic forces to jointly fight against the imperialist evil system and the danger of a new war. The Cominform's resolution on "The Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the Hands of Murderers and Spies" pointed out that the people's democratic system has actually been eliminated in Yugoslavia, a police-style fascist regime has been established in Yugoslavia, and the Tito group has become a gang of spies and murderers executing the will of American and British imperialism, and the "Communist Party of Yugoslavia" in the hands of the Tito gang is only a tool for carrying out espionage tasks. The resolution clearly pointed out that the struggle against the Tito group is the international responsibility of all communist and workers' parties, and the resolution firmly believes that the Yugoslav people have the power to restore people's democracy, and believes that it is necessary to raise revolutionary vigilance in the communist and workers' parties, and to expose and eradicate bourgeois nationalism and imperialist lackeys.

　　The Cominform Resolutions Have Great Historical Significance
　　Is the Action Program for the Fighting of the People of All Countries
The Cominform's resolutions are of equal historical significance to the resolutions of the previous two meetings. The resolution of the first meeting of the Cominform in September 1947 pointed out the existence of two camps, imperialism and anti-imperialism, and the danger of a new war, and called on the anti-imperialist camp to strengthen its unity and fight together against the danger of war and to defend peace, democracy and independence. The facts of the past two years have proved that the Cominform's resolution is completely correct. The struggle between the two camps has become more and more acute, the imperialist camp is becoming increasingly weakened, they continue to frantically prepare for war, the peace and democracy camp has grown unprecedentedly, and the movement to defend peace and oppose new war has spread throughout the world. The second meeting of the Cominform in June 1948 exposed the Tito group's betrayal of democracy and socialism. In less than a year and a half since then, the Tito group has completely and openly rolled into the arms of imperialism. And the principle of proletarian internationalism in the world communist movement has been greatly strengthened. This resolution of the Cominform will make an equally great contribution to the cause of striving for lasting world peace and people's democracy, because it has provided a combat action program for the communist parties, workers' parties, the working class and all progressive people of all countries, ideologically and politically further armed them, and made them more confident in fighting for peace, democracy, national independence and the immediate interests of the people, and will further strengthen the principle of proletarian internationalism in the world workers' movement, eliminate all reactionary ideas that betray Marxism-Leninism, and make the workers' movement more consolidated, developed and strengthened.

　　Bulgaria Crushes the Kostov Spy Treason Case
　　Educate the People of the World to Be More Vigilant
The great practical significance of the Cominform resolution can also be clearly demonstrated from the recent successive cracking of huge spy treason cases in people's democratic countries. Following Hungary's trial of the Rajk spy treason case in September, the Bulgarian Supreme Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the Supreme Court at the end of last month, accusing former Bulgarian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, former Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Kostov, and ten of his accomplices of espionage and treason.

The lengthy indictment filed by the Bulgarian Supreme Procuratorate exposed that Kostov and this small group of traitors were special agents hired by American and British imperialism and the Tito traitor group. They were ordered to disguise themselves and drill into the revolutionary ranks, occupy important positions, and engage in all kinds of despicable activities to betray the country and subvert the people's democratic regime. The indictment also exposed the hideous and ugly faces of the American and British imperialists and the Tito group. As early as during the Second World War, Tito had promised American and British imperialism to carry out anti-Soviet activities in the Balkans after the war, and to make Bulgaria subordinate to the Tito group and join the Western imperialist countries' group to oppose the Soviet Union.

The crushing of the Bulgarian spy treason case has educated the people of the world to be more vigilant, because the closer imperialism and its lackeys are to death, the more frantically they will intensify their fifth column's vile activities. But this incident also warned all imperialist reactionaries that their dispatch of spies to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks will eventually be exposed and suffer a miserable defeat.

　　Dreaming of Saving the Increasingly Serious Crisis
　　International Reactionaries Continue to Frantically Prepare for War
Recently, the international reactionaries, headed by American imperialism, are continuing to frantically prepare for war, dreaming of saving their increasingly serious crisis. This also confirms the correctness of the Cominform resolution. At the end of last month, the North Atlantic Treaty signatories held meetings of the "Military Committee" and the "Defense Committee" in Paris, where the United States pressured other countries to accept the so-called "Atlantic Regional Defense Plan" in order to seize military command of Western European countries and accelerate the preparation for a new war. American imperialism is plotting to establish a West German army and rearm Germany as an aggressive base in Europe. U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman and warmonger Bradley even said: "The establishment of a West German army is desirable." U.S. Defense Secretary Johnson recently publicly clamored in Berlin: "Berlin is part of the Atlantic Treaty, and the eastern line of defense is the Elbe River." From November 26 to 29, the United States also convened a meeting of U.S. diplomats from eleven Middle Eastern countries in Turkey to discuss concrete steps to quickly turn Middle Eastern countries into U.S. strategic bases under the "Military Aid Act." American imperialism's conspiracies against the people of Asia are also continuing. The United States is directing its Philippine puppet Quirino to instigate the reactionary governments of Asian countries to hold a meeting in Manila in January and February next year to discuss the conclusion of an aggressive "Pacific Pact."

　　Brilliant Achievements of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference
　　Draw a Prospect of the Rising of the Eastern Liberation Movement
The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, which opened in Beijing on November 16, lasted for half a month and successfully closed on December 1. The conference unanimously adopted five declarations and resolutions, which are of great importance to the struggle of the working class in Asia and Australia. The conference adopted a resolution to establish an Asian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in China as an organ to strengthen the ties between trade unions in Asian countries and between them and the leading organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The conference's "Resolution on the United Nations Mission to South Korea" condemned all the work of these so-called missions as completely violating the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and supported the Korean people's struggle for independence, unification and democracy. In the "Resolution on the Reports of Trade Unions of Various Countries," the conference called on Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries to take appropriate measures to achieve the unity of the people in order to strive for national independence, democratic peace and the struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. The resolution also called on people to remember the experience of the Chinese people in establishing a national united front and carrying out armed struggle under the leadership of the proletariat when correctly determining the method of struggle. In the two declarations, "Letter to Workers and All Laborers of Asian Countries" and "Appeal to Men and Women Workers of the United States, Britain and France," the conference summoned workers and all people of Asian oppressed countries to resolutely resist the armed attacks of the colonizers, and urged the working class of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands to unite to oppose the unjust wars launched by imperialism in Asian countries.

Now, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, which marks the great unity of the working class in Asia and Australia, has successfully concluded. This conference has drawn a prospect for the further development and rise of the national democratic movement in the East under the leadership of the working class. The cause of striving for lasting world peace and people's democracy will also be further developed as a result, because the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference has taken concrete steps to further strengthen and consolidate the unity and ties between the working classes of Eastern countries and between them and the world working class, and has pointed out the correct path for the people of Eastern countries to strive for independence and liberation.

　　国际一周
    十一月下半月，共产党与工人党情报局在匈牙利举行第三次会议，通过了三项极其重要的决议，并于十一月二十九日公布，情报局在其“保卫和平与对战争贩子的斗争”、“工人阶级的团结与共产党及工人党的任务”的两大决议中，对目前的国际形势作了具体而深刻的分析，指出了和平与民主的力量已大大超过了反动的力量，揭露了帝国主义的更加削弱和不可救药的病症。但是，决议同时告诉一切爱好和平民主的人们，决不应该由于自己力量的巨大增长而自满，因为“帝国主义反动派愈是绝望，则它愈疯狂，而且军事冒险有危险则愈大”。因此情报局号召各国的共产党和工人党，必须邻导工人阶级的广大群众团结起来，在工人阶级进一步团结的基础上，实行一切民主力量的大团结，共同为反对帝国主义的罪恶制度和新战争的危险而斗争。情报局关于“在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党”的决议指明：人民民主制度在南斯拉夫实际上已被消灭，一个警察式的法西斯政权已在南斯拉夫建立，铁托集团已变成执行美英帝国主义意志的一伙间谍和杀人犯，掌握在铁托匪帮手中的“南斯拉夫共产党”，已经只是执行间谍任务的一种工具。决议明确地指出反对铁托集团的斗争，是一切共产党和工人党的国际责任，决议坚信南斯拉夫人民有力量恢复人民民主，并认为必须在共产党和工人党内提高革命警惕性，揭露和根除资产阶级民族主义和帝国主义走卒。
    情报局决议具有重大历史意义
  　是各国人民的战斗的行动纲领
    共产党情报局这些决议和过去两次会议的决议具有同等重大的历史意义。一九四七年九月情报局第一次会议的决议，曾指明帝国主义和反帝国主义两个阵营的存在和新战争的危险，号召反帝国主义阵营应加紧团结，共同为反对战争危险和保卫和平、民主与独立而斗争。两年多以来的事实证明情报局的决议是完全正确的。两个阵营之间的斗争已愈来愈尖锐，帝国主义阵营正日趋削弱，它们仍继续疯狂地进行备战，和平民主阵营已空前壮大，保卫和平与反对新战争的运动遍及全球。一九四八年六月情报局第二次会议，曾揭露了铁托集团对民主与社会主义的背叛，从那时以来还不到一年半，铁托集团已完全公开地滚到帝国主义的怀抱中去了。而世界共产主义运动中的无产阶级国际主义的原则，则已大为加强了。情报局的这一次决议将对争取世界持久和平与人民民主事业，有着同等巨大的贡献，因为它已为各国共产党、工人党、工人阶级和一切进步人民提供了一个战斗的行动纲领，在思想上、政治上更进一步地武装了它们，使它们更充满信心地去为和平、民主、民族独立和人民的切身利益而斗争，同时将更加加强世界工人运动中无产阶级国际主义的原则，扫除一切背叛马列主义的反动思想，使工人运动获得更进一步的巩固、发展与壮大。
    保国扑灭科斯托夫间谍叛国案
  　教育全世界人民更加提高警惕
    情报局决议所具有的重大的现实意义，从最近人民民主国家连续破获巨大的间谍叛国案中也可获得明证。继匈牙利于九月间审判拉伊克间谍叛国案以后，保加利最高检察署于上月底向最高法院提出公诉，控诉前保加利亚部长会议副主席、前保共中央书记科斯托夫及其同谋十人的间谍叛国罪。
    保国最高检察署所提出的长篇起诉书，揭露了科斯托夫这一小撮叛贼，是美英帝国主义和铁托叛徒集团合雇伙用的特务，他们奉令改头换面地钻进革命队伍，穷居要职，从事一切出卖国家和颠覆人民民主政权的卑鄙勾当。起诉书同时暴露了美英帝国主义及铁托集团的反革命嘴脸，是何等狰狞和丑恶。早在第二次世界大战期间，铁托已向美英帝国主义承允于战后在巴尔干实行反苏，并使保加利亚附属于铁托集团，投入西方帝国主义国家集团，一起反对苏联。
    保加利亚间谍叛国案被扑灭的这一事件，教育了全世界人民必须更加提高警惕，因为帝国主义及其走狗愈是临近死亡，它们就愈会疯狂地加紧进行其第五纵队的下流活动。但这一事件同时警告了一切帝国主义反动派，他们派遣奸细混入革命队伍，是终究要被检举出来和遭受惨败的。
    梦想挽救愈来愈严重的危机
  　国际反动派继续疯狂地备战
    最近，以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，正继续疯狂地进行战争准备，梦想挽救其愈来愈严重的危机。这同样证实了情报局决议的正确性。上月底，北大西洋公约签订国在巴黎举行了“军事委员会”和“防务委员会”会议，会中美国压迫其他国家接受了所谓“大西洋区域防御计划”，以攫取西欧各国的军事指挥权，加速新战争的准备。美帝国主义正在阴谋建立西德军队，重新武装德国，作为欧洲的侵略基地。美国联合参谋部主席、战贩布莱德雷竟称：“建立西德陆军是可取的”。美国防部长詹逊近在柏林公开叫嚣：“柏林是大西洋公约的一部分，防务的东线是易北河”。十一月二十六日至二十九日，美国又在土耳其召开了美国驻中东十一国的外交人员会议，讨论使中东各国在“军事援助法”下迅速变成美国战略基地的具体步骤。美帝国主义反对亚洲人民的阴谋活动，也正在继续中。美国正指使其菲律宾傀儡季里诺策动亚洲各国的反动政府，拟于明年一二月在马尼拉开会，讨论缔结侵略性的“太平洋公约”。
    亚澳工会代表会议辉煌成就
  　划出东方解放运动高涨前景
    十一月十六日在北京开幕的亚澳工会代表会议，历时半月，已于十二月一日胜利闭幕。会议一致通过了五项宣言与决议，对亚澳两洲工人阶级的斗争事业具有极大的重要性。会议通过了在中国建立世界工联亚洲联络局的决议，作为加强亚洲各国工会之间，及其与世界工联领导机构之间联系的机关。会议关于“联合国派赴南朝鲜调查团的决议”，指斥了这一切所谓调查团的工作，完全违反了联合国宪章规定的原则，声援了朝鲜人民争取独立统一与民主的斗争。会议在“关于各国工会报告的决议”中，号召亚洲殖民地和平殖民地国家应采取适当办法，达到人民的团结，以争取民族独立、民主和平和反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。决议同时号召在正确决定斗争方法时，要记取中国人民在无产阶级领导下建立民族统一战线和进行武装斗争的经验。会议在“告亚洲各国工人和一切劳动者书”与“致美英法国男女工人呼吁书”两项宣言中，召唤亚洲各被压迫国家的工人和全体人民坚决抵抗殖民者的武装进攻，并敦促美英法荷等国工人阶级一致起来，反对帝国主义在亚洲各国所发动的非正义战争。
    现在，标志着亚澳两洲工人阶级大团结的亚澳工会代表会议已经胜利结束了。这次会议，划出了东方民族民主运动在工人阶级领导之下更加发展更加高涨的前景。为争取世界持久和平与人民民主事业也将因之更加向前发展，因为亚澳工会代表会议已采取具体步骤，更加加强和巩固了东方各国工人阶级之间及其与世界工人阶级之间的团结和联系，并给东方各国人民指明了争取独立解放的正确道路。
