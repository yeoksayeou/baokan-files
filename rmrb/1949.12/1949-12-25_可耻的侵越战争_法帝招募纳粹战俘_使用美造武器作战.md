　　Shameful War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    French Imperialists Recruit Nazi Prisoners of War
    Use American-Made Weapons in Combat
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd] TASS, The Hague dispatch: Newspapers have recently published news stating that French authorities are seeking new mercenaries to conduct the colonial war in Vietnam. According to a report from Paris by a reporter for the Dutch Communist Party newspaper "De Waarheid" ("The Truth"): The French are widely utilizing former officers and soldiers of the Hitler army in the French Foreign Legion in Vietnam. It has been learned from well-informed journalists that the French occupation authorities in West Germany and the French authorities in North Africa are frequently recruiting German prisoners of war—former officers and soldiers from Hitler's army—to suppress national liberation movements in North Africa and Vietnam. Currently, entire divisions composed of former German prisoners of war are fighting in Vietnam. Newly recruited Germans are being sent to the Far East, mostly on American ships. The Americans are supplying these recruited German soldiers with large quantities of supplies and weapons. The reporter pointed out that, in addition to former prisoners of war, the Foreign Legion is also recruiting Germans convicted of civil crimes. The Foreign Legion also has a considerable number of former German stormtroopers. It is reported that the Foreign Legion currently has no fewer than 60,000 former officers and soldiers of the Hitler army.
