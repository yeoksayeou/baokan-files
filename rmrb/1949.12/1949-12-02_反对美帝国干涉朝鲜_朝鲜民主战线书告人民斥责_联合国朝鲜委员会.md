　　Oppose US Imperialist Interference in Korea
    Korean Democratic Front Issues Statement to the People Denouncing the "United Nations Commission on Korea"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st] The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front issued a statement to all patriotic political parties, social organizations, and the people of Korea on the 25th, calling for opposition to the illegal resolutions on the Korean issue passed by the Fourth UN General Assembly under the manipulation of the US-British bloc.
    The statement pointed out that the UN majority, manipulated by the United States, disregarding the protests of the Korean people, illegally passed a resolution to extend and expand the powers of the "United Nations Commission on Korea" without the participation of Korean people's representatives, attempting to continue to interfere in Korea's internal affairs through the United Nations, plunder Korea's resources, and transform South Korea into its colony and military base for aggression.
    The statement further revealed that the conspiracy of the commission is to carry out the will of US imperialism, assist the Lee Seung-man puppet government in strangling democratic forces, and abuse the signboard of the United Nations to implement American colonial policies. It has brought new disasters to the Korean people. The so-called "military observers" included in the commission, which is preparing to come to Korea again, show that the Lee Seung-man puppet government will, under the direct instructions of US imperialism, expand its war to suppress guerrillas in South Korea and attempt to organize new provocations along the 38th parallel.
    The statement finally called on all patriotic political parties, social organizations, and all people of the country to unite closely, overthrow the "United Nations Commission on Korea" that interferes in Korea's internal affairs! Overthrow the Lee Seung-man puppet government that sells out Korea's glory and independence! And strive to realize the Fatherland United Democratic Front's proposal for peaceful unification!

　　反对美帝国干涉朝鲜
    朝鲜民主战线书告人民斥责“联合国朝鲜委员会”
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会，于二十五日发表告全朝鲜爱国政党社会团体暨全国人民书，号召反对第四届联大在美英集团操纵下所通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决定。
    告人民书指出：美国操纵的联大多数派，无视朝鲜人民的抗议，在没有朝鲜人民代表的参加下，非法地通过延长并扩大“联合国朝鲜委员会”权力的决议，企图继续通过联合国干涉朝鲜内政，掠夺朝鲜富源，变南朝鲜为其殖民地和军事侵略基地。
    告人民书继揭露该委员会的阴谋是秉承美帝国主义的意旨，协助李承晚傀儡政府绞杀民主力量，并滥用联合国的招牌来实行美国的殖民政策。它给朝鲜人民带来了新的灾难。这次准备再来朝鲜的该委员会中包括有所谓“军事监察员”，说明李承晚傀儡政府将在美帝国主义的直接指使下，在南朝鲜扩大其镇压游击队的战争，并企图在三八线沿线组织新的挑衅行为。
    告人民书最后号召全国爱国政党、社会团体及全体人民紧密地团结起来，打倒干涉朝鲜内政的“联合国朝鲜委员会！”打倒出卖朝鲜的光荣与独立的李承晚傀儡政府！并为实现祖国统一民主主义战线关于和平统一的建议而奋斗！
