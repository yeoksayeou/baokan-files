　　Chapter Four: The Characteristics of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Section One: The Scientific Nature, Unity, and Completeness of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    They only grasp certain temporary, individual, isolated phenomena and proceed from there. They explain social and economic phenomena by starting with travelers in the desert, woodcutters in the deep mountains, and fishermen on the shores of desolate islands, instead of starting with basic, massive, and long-term phenomena. Therefore, bourgeois economics cannot explain the essence of the economy and its internal relationships, and cannot dissect and analyze with a scientific viewpoint and scientific methods, but can only vulgarly list certain economic phenomena to defend the bourgeoisie and deceive and paralyze the working class. The founders of scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, and the Marxist-Leninist political economists after them, have always held a contemptuous attitude towards these vulgar bourgeois economic theories.
    The Complexity, Confusion, Intricacy, Fragmentation, and Lack of System of Bourgeois Political Economy
    The unity and completeness of proletarian political economy are also characteristics not found in bourgeois political economy. Not only is the theoretical foundation of bourgeois political economy unscientific and anti-scientific, but their theoretical system is also not unified, not complete, and cannot be unified or complete; their arguments are divergent and inconsistent. Because the interests of the bourgeoisie in various countries are inconsistent and contradictory, the views of bourgeois political economy in various countries cannot be consistent or unified. Each capitalist country has its own bourgeois political economic theories, and various schools of bourgeois political economy exist in each country. Moreover, within the same capitalist country, due to the internal contradictions of the domestic bourgeoisie, different schools are formed. Even within the same country and the same school, each bourgeois political economist attempts to establish his own system, attempting to establish an economic theory different from others and different from other schools. They regard novelty and originality as their ability, resulting in the divergence of bourgeois economic theories and the complexity, intricacy, confusion, and lack of system of bourgeois political economy. From the perspective of historical development, the schools of bourgeois economics include the mercantilist school, the physiocratic school, the classical school (or orthodox school), and some schools collectively known as vulgar schools—such as the neo-classical school, the historical school, the psychological school, the eclectic school, the mathematical school, the fascist school, and the new historical school, the new psychological school, the new eclectic school, ... etc. In terms of nationality, in addition to the classical school or orthodox school in the early days of capitalism in Britain, there was also the neo-classical school later. Germany has the German school or historical school, Austria has the Austrian school or psychological school, and the United States has the eclectic school and the more recent mathematical school. In addition, Germany, Italy, and Japan have fascist schools, etc. As for Japan, a backward capitalist country, and old China, a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, all schools are present, in a vast and mixed array. Bourgeois economists from various countries each have their own opinions, forming their own independent theories. They attack, oppose, and slander each other, even opposing and attacking their own ancestors. In feudal China, disciples formed their own schools, and their teachers sighed "entering my room and wielding my spear." This is more than fitting to describe the situation of bourgeois political economists.
    Not only are the theoretical systems among the various schools of bourgeois political economy extremely inconsistent and extremely chaotic and complex, but the theoretical system of each bourgeois scholar itself is also fragmented, without connection, and without system. The various parts are not closely connected, but can be arbitrarily moved and changed. We can arbitrarily reverse the first and last chapters, or reverse and fragment the order of some of the chapters, without affecting the understanding of their entire narrative. Therefore, from this point alone, bourgeois political economy is also incomparable to the systematic, rigorous, and complete proletarian political economy. Therefore, its fragmentation and lack of system are the characteristics of bourgeois political economy.

　　第四章　马列主义政治经济学的特点
    第一节马列主义政治经济学的科学性、统一性与完整性
    他们只抓住某些一时的，个别的，孤立的现象并从那里出发，他们从沙漠中的旅客，深山中的樵夫与荒岛上海边上的渔夫等等出发，来说明社会经济的现象，而不是从基本的、大量的、长期的现象出发。因此，资产阶级经济学不能说明经济的本质及其内部关系，不能用科学的观点和科学的方法来解剖、分析，而只能庸俗地罗列某些经济现象，来为资产阶级辩护，来欺骗麻痹工人阶级。科学的社会主义的创始者马克思恩格斯与他们以后的马列主义政治经济学者，从来是对于这些庸俗派的资产阶级经济学说，抱持蔑视的态度的。
    资产阶级政治经济学的复杂性混乱性错综性破裂性无系统性
    无产阶级政治经济学的统一性与完整性，也是资产阶级政治经济学所没有的特点。资产阶级政治经济学，不但它的理论基础是不科学，反科学的；而且它们的理论系统也是不统一，不完整的，并且也无法统一，无法完整；他们议论纷纭，莫衷一是。因为各国资产阶级由于各国间资产阶级利益的互不一致，互相矛盾，因此各国资产阶级政治经济学的观点，也就不能一致，不能统一。各个资本主义国家各自有着他们自己的资产阶级政治经济学的学说，各国都有各自不同的资产阶级政治经济学的派别存在，而且在同一个资本主义国家内，又由于本国内资产阶级内部利益的矛盾，因此又形成着各不相同的派别，即使在同一国家同一派别之内，每个资产阶级政治经济学者，都企图建立自己的系统，企图建立不同于他人不同于其他派别的经济学理论。他们以标新立异，独树一帜为能事，以致表现了资产阶级经济学理论的纷歧，表现了资产阶级政治经济学的复杂性、错综性、混乱性与无系统性。资产阶级经济学的派别，就其历史发展程序来看，有重商学派、重农学派、古典学派（或正统派）以及此后总名为庸俗派的一些派别——如新古典学派、历史学派、心理学派、折衷学派、数理学派、法西斯派与新历史学派、新心理学派、新折衷学派、……等等。就国别上说来，英国除资本主义初期的古典学派或正统派以外，以后又有新古典学派，德国有德国学派或历史学派，奥地利有奥地利学派或心理学派，美国有折衷派以及较近的数理学派，此外德国意大利日本有法西斯派等等，至于资本主义后进国的日本与半殖民地半封建的旧中国，则各派俱全，庞然杂陈。各国资产阶级经济学者，各人都有个人自己的见解，形成自己独立的学说，他们各派与各人间，又是相互攻击，相互反对，相互诋毁，甚至连他们自己的老祖宗，也都要反对攻击。中国封建时代，弟子们自成一派，为其师者有“入吾室操吾戈”之叹，拿来形容资产阶级政治经济学者的情形，倒有过之而无不及。
    资产阶级政治经济学，不但各派间的理论系统极不一致，极度混乱复杂，而且每一个资产阶级学者的理论系统本身，也是各部分彼此割裂，毫无联系，毫无系统的。它们各部分间也不是紧密密地联系着，而是可以任意搬移变动的。我们可以把第一篇与最后一篇任意倒置，或者把其中几篇的次序予以颠倒割裂，而对于了解他们整个的叙述并没有什么关系。所以仅就这一点说来，资产阶级政治经济学也是与系统严密完整的无产阶级政治经济学不可比拟的。故其破裂性与无系统性，正是资产阶级政治经济学的特色。
