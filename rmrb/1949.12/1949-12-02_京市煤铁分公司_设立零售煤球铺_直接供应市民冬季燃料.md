Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company
    Establishes Retail Coal Briquette Shops
    Directly Supplies Residents with Winter Fuel
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company has established 150 retail coal briquette shops within a week to directly supply residents with fuel. It began selling coal at the company's stipulated prices on November 24th. The business situation of each retail coal briquette shop has been very good in the past few days. For example, the Fuxingchang Coal Shop in the inner fourth district used to sell only more than 700 jin per day, but on the first day of selling at the Coal and Iron Company's prices, it sold more than 4,000 jin, and the most sold 7,000 to 8,000 jin. Therefore, each household is constantly increasing the amount of processing, generally increasing from 500 to 600 jin per day to 4,000 to 5,000 jin. Most of the coal buyers are working-class citizens, who happily stated: With the Coal and Iron Company handling retail sales, the problem of coal for the common people is no longer an issue. The company has now formed two groups to go to each coal shop to solicit opinions and understand the situation. Some coal shops still have problems such as selling coal briquettes that are not 80% dry enough, the signs at the entrance are not obvious or clear, and the coal sales methods are not thoroughly implemented, which should be corrected quickly.

　　京市煤铁分公司
    设立零售煤球铺
    直接供应市民冬季燃料
    【北京讯】北京市煤铁分公司在一星期内设立零售煤球铺一百五十户，直接供给市民燃料。并于十一月二十四日开始按该公司规定价格售煤。各零售煤球铺几天来经营情况很好。如内四区福兴昌煤铺，过去每日仅销七百多斤，按煤铁公司价格开始的头一天就卖出四千多斤，最多的还卖出七、八千斤。因之各户不断增大加工数量，一般由日摇五、六百斤增至四、五千斤。购煤户多为劳动市民，他们高兴地表示：煤铁公司办理零销，老百姓烧煤再不成问题了。该公司现已组成两个小组，分赴各煤铺征求意见与了解情况，有的煤铺还存在着卖出煤球不够八成干，门口挂牌不明显、不清楚，不彻底执行售煤办法等问题，应迅速改正。
