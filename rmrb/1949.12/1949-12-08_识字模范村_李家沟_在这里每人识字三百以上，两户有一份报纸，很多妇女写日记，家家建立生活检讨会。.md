Literacy Model Village - Lijia Gou
	Here, everyone is literate with over 300 characters, every two households share a newspaper, many women write diaries, and every family has established a life review meeting.
	Since the launch of the literacy campaign in Lushun City, model award conferences have been held in the spring, summer, and autumn of this year. Lijia Gou Village in Shuangdao District has been selected as a literacy model village for three consecutive times. Jiang Shulan from the village has won the title of first-class literacy model student three times; the village's study class and study group are also first-class models, and teacher Li Jijun has been selected as a first-class model teacher twice.
	The entire village has seventy-seven households with four hundred and sixty-five people. Before the literacy campaign, there were one hundred and fifteen illiterate people (thirty-four men and eighty-one women) aged fourteen to fifty-five, accounting for 24.7% of the total population. Now, everyone is participating in the study, with a 100% daily attendance rate. In terms of literacy achievement, among the ninety-six people participating in the literacy school, the least has learned 500 characters, and the most, Jiang Shulan, has learned 1,700 characters. The other nineteen women participated in the "Kang-head study group," of which five have learned over 500 characters, eight have learned over 400 characters, and six have learned over 300 characters – these are the least literate people in the entire village. Among them is a 56-year-old woman, Zhang Yuying, who looks after children in the nursery while participating in the Kang-head study group, and has also learned 350 characters.
	The number of newspaper readers in the village has increased. In the spring, the whole village only had six copies of the Guandong People's Daily; now, the village has subscribed to 23 copies of the "Farmer's Daily," meaning almost every two households have a newspaper.
	Among the ninety-six students studying at the literacy school, eighty-nine can write daily life diaries. Here is a page from Wang Guilan's diary:
	"On the evening of September 23rd, we held a celebration meeting for the founding of the People's Republic of China, and also held an entertainment party. I was particularly happy in my heart. We finally have our own country! From now on, I must seize the opportunity to study hard, produce well, and also unite the less active members to improve production and learning a step further."
	Liu Cuixia's diary reads:
	"On the sixteenth, I helped Li Demu peel corn for a day, our entire group finished peeling corn, five characters." (The words in parentheses were added by the reporter).
	The paralyzed Li Deqin also wrote a diary:
	"I made a meal at home in the morning, after eating, Dad fetched water, I washed clothes, and after washing clothes, I mended clothes (I, a man, did a woman's work)." This young man with disabilities only has his father and himself at home, so he made a special note of "I, a man, did a woman's work."
	The political awareness of the masses in the whole village has been raised. When the government called for planting trees in the autumn, the higher authorities assigned the task of planting 3,000 trees, which everyone, young and old, men and women, had to do. The village cadres estimated that it would take one and a half days to complete, but it was completed in one day. During the autumn grain requisition, the village cadres had not yet returned from a meeting in the district, but the masses had already dried the grain. On the evening before delivering the public grain, many people did not sleep, competing to deliver it earlier. In the past, mobilizing everyone to build a nursery was very difficult, but this year, many people competed to go. Because they have clearly understood the relationship between the people and the People's Government through learning.
	Family relationships have also changed. Since June, family life review meetings have been universally and automatically established in the village, held at least once a month. Many phenomena of disunity between husband and wife, sisters-in-law, brothers, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in the family have been resolved; no more quarrels can be seen in the village. For example, in Li Deyun's family, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law used to be at odds, and would quarrel over the slightest thing, but since holding several family life review meetings, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law has improved. The daughter-in-law teaches her mother-in-law to read every night. Now, the mother-in-law has also learned more than 500 characters.
	These achievements come from a difficult and tortuous struggle. At the beginning of the literacy movement, the cadres did not pay attention to this work. When the masses came to school, the cadres were either holding meetings or arranging production. If students were absent, they used coercive methods such as "fining kerosene, fining for not doing night watch..." The enthusiasm of the masses for schooling was generally low: some people were afraid of being fined, so they had to come; some people didn't care, thinking that being fined one catty was fine, and they wouldn't go to class anyway; others procrastinated and relied on it: "Fine me, anyway, I won't give it, see what you can do." Most illiterate people had no understanding of learning, such as the poor peasant Li Demao who said: "I can do other movements, I dare to compete with you; but asking me to go to school, I can't go even if you put a knife to my neck." The teachers also had no experience, did not prepare well in advance, lectured without considering the needs of the students, and stuffed knowledge without caring whether they understood or not. Therefore, the students were not enthusiastic, only forty or so people went to school, and they became more and more distressed, dozing off in class.
	Later, village cadres Wang Xintang (the current secretary of the CCP village branch) and Li Deyun returned from attending the labor model conference and studied how to improve the literacy work. First, they held a cadre meeting, reviewed the past shortcomings, and everyone recognized the importance of the literacy movement. They said: "If the students are not learning well, it is because our cadres are not leading well." So they organized the village leaders and activists to go deep among the masses to mobilize them. Then, they held a mass meeting, where the cadres focused on self-criticism, then publicized the benefits of literacy, and then solicited the opinions of the masses. The masses raised problems, such as feeling that they could not learn anything by going to school, there were no desks and benches in the school, and women had no one to take care of their children...
	The cadres solved the problems one by one according to the situation. First, they mobilized the masses, and everyone worked together, dividing manpower and material resources, making thirty-five sets of desks and benches; they also renovated the literacy school building; at the same time, they organized a "nursery," mobilizing several old women to take care of the children of the women who went to school. The cadres specifically divided the work, appointing a literacy committee member to specifically supervise the teachers, requiring them to prepare well before class, discuss in advance what to talk about, how to talk, and solicit opinions from the students at any time, thus improving the teaching methods.
	Through these methods, the learning situation improved somewhat. Therefore, the cadres and activists went even more urgently to mobilize the illiterate people who had not gone to school, with each person responsible for mobilizing several people, explaining to them in various ways. Even the most stubborn people were persuaded to go to school.
	When Lijia Gou was selected during the city's award for literacy models in the spring, it greatly encouraged the whole village, and cadres, teachers, and students were all swept up in a learning frenzy. Students combined learning with walking, working, and visiting each other. For example, Gu Xiaoli had a sore on his buttocks and could not sit, but he did not miss a single day of class; Jiang Shulan suffered from autumn dysentery, but also went to class every day. When others advised her, she said: "I feel bored if I don't study for a day." During the autumn harvest, some women returned late from the mountains, sometimes without even eating, and rushed to class when they heard the bell. The government stipulated a 20-day holiday during the autumn harvest, but after the holiday, 14 people wrote letters to the cadres requesting to start school early, and as a result, everyone agreed to start school ten days early. During the autumn grain requisition, the cadres were busy with the grain requisition, and the village's cultural station chief moved to another village. Since they were a few days late in re-electing a replacement, the masses wrote letters to the cadres to express their opinions and urged them to elect one as soon as possible in order to take charge of the literacy work.
	After the learning enthusiasm of the masses rose, the cadres became even more energetic. For example, when the higher authorities instructed that the "Three-More Movement" (more reading, more writing, more application) should be carried out in literacy, they studied it for three consecutive nights, and decided to establish a small library, collecting 270 popular books through borrowing and purchasing for everyone to read. They also came up with some ways to let everyone write and apply more. They paid attention to the learning of illiterate people at any time, asking "How is your literacy going?" when they met, and also mobilized challenges between classes, groups, and students, or between sisters-in-law and couples. At the same time, they adhered to the spirit of more commendation and more criticism, awarding model students once a month. Those who did not miss class, did well in the "Three-More Movement," and were able to promote the learning of others were graded into five levels and awarded prizes after being assessed by all the students in the class. Wang Guilan was an active member of the "Three-More Movement," and after winning an award, she happily wrote a letter to tell her husband, saying: "Work hard in the ranks. This letter was written by me. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, how could I be able to write letters!..."
	In addition, the cadres set an example by engaging in collective learning every day and focusing on the learning of activists, which greatly influenced the masses.
	Teacher Li Jijun, in one heart and one mind with the cadres, also played a great role in the development of the literacy movement. He never missed a class, no matter what happened. He often studied teaching methods with the cadres, and conducted teaching based on the opinions and requirements of the masses. In the second quarter, some students' literacy levels were not high, and they suggested that it was not enough to just write new characters on the blackboard; there was no connection between the context, and they could not remember them. He followed everyone's opinion and changed to writing sentences or texts. In the third quarter, everyone's level improved, and he changed to writing single characters according to the students' requirements.
	When teaching new characters, he mainly used board paintings and real objects. For example, when teaching "cart" and "sickle," he drew pictures on the blackboard, and the students smiled and said: Oh, aren't those the two characters "cart"? This was very helpful in helping the students' memory.
	When explaining sentences, he tried to find examples from the actual lives of the students. For example, when explaining "plan," he started from production plans and family plans.
	He was also good at adjusting the students' learning emotions. For example, when the students were very tired from working during the day, he changed his approach, teaching characters through teaching songs. Therefore, all the students in the village could sing several songs.
	In the third quarter, the higher authorities proposed that learning and application should be consistent. After discussing with the cadres, he adopted the method of strengthening students' writing of blackboard newspaper articles and daily life diaries. First, he wrote a diary himself for everyone to see, and then mobilized active students to take the lead. At first, the students felt a little difficult, but gradually, most of the students wrote. He carefully checked each student's diary and notes every day, and patiently taught them one by one when he found misspelled characters or characters that the students did not know how to write.
	Every two weeks, he asked the students to write a short essay. Once, Li Shuhua wrote an article: "I went to catch the sea early in the morning, I guarantee to catch a basket of seaweed in the morning, and cut fifty catties of grass in the afternoon, I guarantee that I will never forget saving for a moment." In this way, the learning was connected to the students' lives, so that the characters they learned could be used.
	He was also able to give students current affairs talks frequently according to the changes in the political situation. For example, when the People's Republic of China was founded, he explained the meaning to everyone based on the newspapers, and also taught everyone how to make the national flag.
	In order to maintain the students' learning enthusiasm, he often told the students stories about suffering losses because they were illiterate; he gave special patient guidance to individual students who were less intelligent, establishing their confidence in learning.
	Another characteristic of the Lijia Gou literacy school is that it adheres to various learning systems, which makes learning more consolidated. For example, each person writes an article for the blackboard newspaper every week, and the teacher grades them according to their quality. Leave requests are written as leave slips. There are small tests every week and monthly exams every month, without interruption.

　　识字模范村——李家沟
    在这里每人识字三百以上，两户有一份报纸，很多妇女写日记，家家建立生活检讨会。
    旅顺市开展识字运动以来，今年春、夏、秋三季都举行了奖励模范大会。双岛区的李家沟村连续三次当选为识字模范村，该村姜淑兰，则三次荣获一等识字模范学员的称号；村里的学习班和学习组，也是一等模范，教员李继俊，已经当选了两次一等模范教师。
    全村七十七户，四百六十五口人，在识字运动以前，十四岁到五十五岁的文盲共有一百十五名（男三十四，女八十一名），占全人口的百分之二四．七。现在全部参加了学习，每天出席的人数是百分之百。在识字成绩上，参加识字学校的九十六人，最少的也学了五百个字，最高的是姜淑兰，学了一千七百字。其他十九名妇女参加了“炕头学习小组”，其中五个人学了五百字以上，八个人学了四百字以上，六个人学了三百字以上——这是全村识字最少的人了。她们中间有一位是五十六岁的张玉英老大娘，一面在托儿所看孩子，一面参加炕头小组学习，也学了三百五十个字。
    村里面，看报的人增加了，春天，全村只有六份关东人民日报；现在，全村增订了“农民报”二十三份，差不多两户人家有了一份报纸。
    在识字学校学习的九十六名学员中，有八十九名会写生活日记了。这里是王桂兰的一页日记：
    “在九月二十三日那天晚上，开庆祝中华人民共和国成立大会，还开娱乐晚会，我心里特别高兴，我们这回可有了自己的国家了！从今后我一定要抓紧学习，好好生产，还团结不积极的会员们都要把生产学习提高一步。”
    刘翠霞的日记这样写着：
    “十六日给李德木扒（剥）苞米一天，我们全组苞米扒（剥）完了，五个字。”（意思是说剥完苞米学了五个字。括号内的字为记者所加）。
    瘫子李德钦也写日记了：
    “我早晨在家做一饨（顿）饭，吃完爹爹挑的水，我洗衣裳，洗完了衣裳又补衣裳（我男人干女人活）。”这位有残疾的青年，他家只有父子两个，所以他把“男人干女人活”特别记下来。
    全村群众的政治认识提高了。在秋季政府号召栽树时，上级布置栽三千棵树的任务，大人小孩男男女女都要去，村干部预定要一天半才能栽完，结果一天完成了。在秋征时，村干部在区上开会还没回来，群众早已把粮食晒干了。送公粮的前一天晚上，很多人不睡觉争着早些送。以前动员大家修苗圃，很费劲，今年，许多人争着要去了。因为他们从学习中认清楚了人民与人民政府的关系。
    家庭关系也改变了。从六月份开始，全村普遍自动的建立了家庭生活检讨会，每月至少开会一次。解决了许多家庭夫妻间、妯娌间、弟兄间、婆媳间不团结的现象；全村再也看不到争吵的事情。如李德云家，过去婆媳不和，一点小事就指鸡骂狗地吵一顿，自从开了几次家庭生活检讨会，婆媳关系搞好了，媳妇天天晚上教婆婆识字。到现在，婆婆也学了五百多个字。
    这些成绩是从一段艰难曲折的奋斗过程中得来的。在识字运动开始时，干部不重视这个工作，群众来上学，干部不是开会就是布置生产，如果学员有不到的就用强迫命令方式，“罚火油，罚打更……”，群众上学情绪普遍低落：一些人怕罚，不得不来；一些人则满不在乎，罚就罚一斤，反正我不去上课；另有一些人则拖赖着：“由你罚吧，反正我不给，看能怎么。”大部分文盲对学习没有认识，如贫农李德茂说：“别的运动我都能干，我都敢和你们比一比；但是叫我上学，把刀按在我脖子上我也不能去。”教员也没有经验，事先不好好准备，讲课不按学员需要，不管懂不懂一股劲的“填鸭”。因此学员很不起劲，上学的只有四十多人，而且越学越苦恼，在课堂上打盹。
    后来村干部王宪堂（现任中共村支书）与李德云参加了劳动模范大会回来，就研究改进识字工作。首先召开干部会，检讨了过去的缺点，大家认清了识字运动的重要性，他们说：“学员学的不好，就是我们干部领导的不好。”于是就组织闾长以上干部和积极分子深入群众中去动员。接着召开群众大会，干部着重地作了自我检讨，然后宣传识字的好处，再征求群众的意见。群众把问题说出来了，如感到上学学不到什么东西，学校里没有桌凳，妇女有小孩无人照管……。
    干部们根据情况，逐一解决问题，首先发动群众，大家一齐动手，分出人力物力，作了三十五套桌凳；又把识字学校校舍整理好；同时组织“托儿所”，动员几个老大娘给上学的妇女看孩子。干部们具体分工，推一个识字委员专门负责督促教员，要他上课前作好准备，预先商量讲些啥，怎样讲，并随时向学员征求意见，这样，教学方法也改善了。
    通过这些方法，学习情况有些好转。于是，干部和积极分子更紧张地去动员未上学的文盲，每人负责动员几个人，找他们多方解释，最顽固的人也被说服上学了。
    春季全市奖励识字模范时，李家沟当选了。这对全村受了很大鼓励，干部、教师、学员都卷入学习热潮。学员们走路、干活、串门子，都结合着学习。如谷孝礼臀部生疮不能坐，但没有缺一天课；姜淑兰患一秋痢疾，也天天上课，别人劝她，她说：“我一天不学习就闷得慌。”秋收当中，有的妇女上山回家晚，有时还没吃饭，听着钟声就赶去上课。政府规定秋收期间放假二十天，可是放假后有十四个人写信给干部要求提前开学，结果大家同意早开学十天。在秋季征粮工作中，干部们忙着征粮，村里文化站长搬到别村去了，迟了几天没有补选，群众就写信对干部提意见，催促早些选出，好掌握识字工作。
    群众学习情绪起来之后，干部们更有劲了。如上级指示识字中要开展三多运动（多看、多写、多用），他们就连着研究了三个晚上，决定成立小型图书馆，连借加买，征集通俗书籍二百七十本，供大家看。又想出一些让大家多写多用的办法。他们随时留心文盲的学习，见了面就问“识字怎么样啦？”并且发动班、组、学员之间或妯娌、夫妇之间挑战。同时掌握多表扬，多批评的精神，每月奖励一次模范学员，对不缺席，三多运动作得好，能推动别人学习的，经全班学员评定，分五等发给奖品。王桂兰就是三多运动的积极分子，得奖后乐得写信告诉她男人说：“在队伍里好好干吧。这封信是我写的，要没有共产党领导，我还能会写信！……”
    此外，干部们以身作则，每天集体学习，并抓紧积极分子的学习，给了群众以很大影响。
    教员李继俊，和干部们同心同德，对识字运动的开展也起了极大的作用。他无论有什么事，从来不缺课。经常和干部研究教学方法，根据群众的意见和要求来进行教学。第二季时，有些学员识字程度不高，提出在黑板上光写生字不行，上下文没有联系，记不住，他就本着大家的意见，改写句子或课文；到第三季，大家程度提高了，他又根据学员要求改写单字。
    在教生字的时候，主要利用板画和实物。如教“大车”“镰刀”，就在黑板上画了图，学员一看就笑嘻嘻地说：噢，那不是“大车”两个字吗？这样，很能帮助学员的记忆。
    解释语句的时候，尽量是从学员的实际生活找例子，如讲“计划”，就从生产计划、按家计划说起。
    他又善于调剂学员的学习情绪，如学员白天干活很疲劳时，他就转变方式，通过教歌子来教字。因此，全村学员都会唱几支歌子了。
    第三季，上级提出学用一致，在和干部作了研究以后，他采用了加强学员写壁报稿子和生活日记的方法。首先自己写了日记给大家看，再发动积极学员带头，起初学员感到有些困难，但慢慢地，大部分学员都写了。他每天仔细检查每个学员的日记和笔记，发现错字或学员空着不会写的字，就耐心地一个一个地教。
    每两星期，他叫学员作一次短文。有一次，李淑华作了一篇：“我一早去赶海，头晌保证赶筐海菜，下晌割五十斤草，保证我一时一刻也忘不了节约。”就是这样，联系学员的生活，使学了的字就能用。
    他并能随着政治形势的变化，经常给学员讲时事问题，如中华人民共和国成立时，他根据报纸，把意义讲给大家听，同时教给大家国旗的制法。
    为了保持学员的学习情绪，他时常对学员讲一些因为不识字吃了亏的故事；对个别较笨的学员，特别耐心指导，建立他们的学习信心。
    李家沟识字学校还有一个特点，使学习更能巩固，就是坚持各种学习制度。如壁报每周每人写一篇，教师根据好坏批分。请假都写请假条。每周有小考，一月有月考，从不间断。
