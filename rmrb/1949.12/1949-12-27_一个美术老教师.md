　　An Old Art Teacher
    Xiao Nan
    After the implementation of the full-time teacher system, the first person to move into the school was Teacher Li. He is an elderly man of fifty with greying hair who has been teaching art for twenty years. During morning exercises, he runs with us, and we say, "Why are you so lively now?" He smiles and says, "Since the liberation of Beijing, I have been very happy. I feel that only by truly joining the ranks of young people can I appreciate the infinite joy of the new China's education cause!"
    Before liberation, he was merely a person "living to live." After liberation, he began to embark on the path of art serving the people, and he constantly encouraged everyone, saying, "The art of the past was decoration for landlords and the bourgeoisie. They liked what they liked, and the artists painted what they painted. Now art serves the broad masses of the people. Therefore, painting figures is more important than painting landscapes. You must work hard to draw plaster casts and lay a solid foundation!"
    To celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to class time, he painted portraits of leaders in his dormitory, sometimes forgetting to eat. For several days, he insisted on working until 3 a.m. before falling asleep in his clothes.
    He painted while directing the students in painting propaganda posters.
    The ten large portraits, each four and a half feet, of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Gorky, Pushkin, Lu Xun, etc., were successfully completed. He stood in front of the giant portrait of the people's leader Mao Zedong, smiling, feeling that his life was integrated with the art of serving the people. The art philosophy of Taine in France is something he often read. He is preparing to study scientific viewpoints and methods and then write something about art theory. He told us, "When teaching children's drawings, it is necessary to select teaching materials based on their interests and lives, and combine them with practice to conduct ideological education. If you teach urban children to draw apples, only ask them if they are good-looking? Delicious? What color? That can only achieve the educational purpose of image and color, and can only instill the idea of appreciation and enjoyment, which is useless. It is necessary to further extend: who grew the apple? Who made the furniture for planting trees? Educate them to love workers and peasants, and tell them that if there were no working people, they would not see or eat beautiful apples..." Therefore, he often said, "I must study hard and master the correct stance, viewpoints, and methods; otherwise, it will directly affect these four hundred or so teachers and indirectly affect a number of children."

　　一个美术老教师
    萧南
    实行专任教员制以后，第一个搬到学校来住的就是李老师。他是头发斑白五十岁的老人，已经教了二十年美术。早操的时候，他和我们一块跑步，我们说：“您现在为什么这么活泼？”他笑着说：“从北京解放那天起，我就非常快乐，我觉得只有真正走进青年的队伍中，才体会到新中国的教育事业有着无限乐趣！”
    解放前，他仅仅是一个“为活着而活着”的人，解放后，他开始走向了美术为人民服务的道路，并不时地鼓励大家说：“从前的艺术是地主、资产阶级的装饰品，他们喜欢什么，画家就画什么，现在的艺术是为人民大众服务的了，所以画人物是比画风景更重要，你们一定要下苦工夫画石膏像，打好基础！”
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立，他除了上课时间，就是在自己的寝室里画领袖像，有时忘了吃饭。有几天他是坚持工作到夜三时后才和衣而睡的。
    他一面作画一面指挥着学生们画宣传画。
    马、恩、列、斯、高尔基、普希金、鲁迅等十幅四尺半的巨像成功了，他站在人民领袖毛泽东的巨像面前笑着，觉得自己的生命和为人民服务的艺术结为一体了。法国泰伊的艺术哲学是他经常翻阅的，他正准备着学习科学的观点方法后，写点关于艺术理论方面的东西。他告诉我们：“教儿童图画，一定要根据他们的兴趣和生活选教材，结合实际进行思想教育。如果教城市儿童画苹果，只问他好看不？好吃不？什么颜色的？那只能达到形象与颜色的教育目的，只能灌输欣赏和享受的思想，是无益的，必须进一步的引伸：苹果是谁种的？种树的家具是谁制造的？教育他们热爱工农，告诉他们如果没有劳动人民就看不见更吃不到美好的苹果……”所以他时常说：“我必须好好学习掌握正确的立场观点方法，否则就直接影响这四百多师资，间接影响若干的儿童。”
