　　Work Study on Official Documents of Government Agencies
  　Introduction to the Working Experience of the Secretariat of the Former North China People's Government
    Li Jianfei
    To improve the administrative efficiency of government agencies, the work of official documents must first be done well, especially in high-level government agencies. The working experience of the Secretariat of the former North China People's Government over the past year is introduced as follows:
    I. From the very beginning last year, we paid attention to establishing a system for handling official documents in accordance with actual needs and possible conditions. We formulated relatively clear regulations on some methods for handling official documents, including document processing, types of documents and inter-agency relations, as well as document formats, etc., so that the entire process of documents from receipt, filing, research and drafting, review and approval, writing, proofreading, printing, sealing and distribution, and archiving, all have certain systems to follow. We also continuously studied and improved these systems based on new situations, gradually making the handling of documents orderly, accurate, and rapid, so as to improve work efficiency. Especially in high-level leading agencies, the division of labor is more refined, and the handling of one matter often involves the responsibilities of other departments, so the number of times documents are circulated for review is much higher than in lower-level agencies. Another characteristic of high-level agencies is that there are more leaders reviewing documents, which also increases the number of times documents are circulated. In response to these characteristics, we adopted the following methods: 1. Organize joint office work; 2. Send personnel to consult with relevant departments; 3. Issue documents to relevant departments and leaders for review; 4. Departments in charge of managing document circulation must also establish a "document processing situation registration system" to check and register where documents are transferred to at any time. In this way, no matter which link the document is running in, it can be clearly found out with one check, which can effectively prevent the loss and backlog of documents.
    II. The handling of official documents should implement a centralized leadership, division of labor and responsibility system. The so-called centralized leadership means handling documents under the overall intention and unified leadership of the leaders. In this way, it can be closely combined with the political tasks and central work of a certain period, and the leaders' intentions can be closely combined with the specific work of the subordinates. It is possible to grasp the priorities and distinguish different situations, and determine which matters should be handled urgently and first, and which can be handled later and slowly, so as to concentrate efforts on handling current urgent matters without being disconnected. It is possible to take care of all parties, grasp the overall situation, and coordinate and unify the interrelationships between departments, so as to avoid each doing its own thing and conflicting with each other. The so-called division of labor and responsibility refers to the personnel who assist the leaders in handling documents, dividing the work and being responsible for their respective duties: matters that can be handled by the section (such as some daily specific affairs: publishing seals according to regulations, requesting and issuing documents, inquiring whether documents have been received and how they are handled, etc.) do not need to be sent to the division for handling; matters that can be handled by the division level (such as some daily routine official documents and specific affairs) do not need to be submitted to the secretary-general for review; the secretary-general should generally be fully responsible for the handling of routine official affairs, and the administrative leaders do not have to handle everything themselves. The secretariat uses its secretariat mechanism to handle matters level by level, reducing the complexity of document layers, while strengthening the reporting and requesting system and the inspection system, so that it can be handled properly. The advantage of doing this is that it can make the handling of documents rapid, accurate, and efficient, and it can also avoid the leaders being troubled by daily paperwork, and can concentrate on considering and solving more important work in all aspects, and can give play to the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of cadres, and cultivate cadres' ability to work independently. The former North China People's Government did this in the later period, which proved to be a better method.
    III. Document processing must be done quickly to prevent delays and backlogs. Our slogan is: "Do today's work today." In case of urgent matters, we are not restricted by office hours and try our best to complete them in a concentrated manner; on Sundays and holidays, there are special personnel on duty, so we guarantee the rapid completion of work tasks. However, when government administrative affairs are complicated, it is difficult to "do today's work today," so it is necessary to deal with them according to the nature and content of the documents, distinguishing between importance and urgency. Therefore, in addition to putting forward the slogan "Do today's work today," we also put forward "Work should be divided into important and urgent matters: urgent and important matters should be handled in advance." This adapts to the actual situation of having few people and many things, and can actually avoid backlog of documents. In addition, in order to continuously improve work efficiency, we also adopted the following methods: 1. For urgent requests for instructions, the government will reply by phone as much as possible internally, and reply by telegram externally, and issue official documents later if needed; 2. For less important matters, only reply by phone, and note in the handling column of the document "informed XX department XX comrade by telegram at XX o'clock on XX month XX day," without issuing another document. 3. According to the nature and content of the documents, we stipulated that "urgent documents" and "express documents" should be marked with stamps, and different colored folders should be used when submitting them for review (urgent documents use red, and general documents use white paper folders) to remind the recipients to pay attention and facilitate handling according to priority. 4. Simple official documents such as internal replies and memos are printed and issued by the original handlers without going through the procedures of printing, proofreading, and supervision. 5. In addition to writing letters and making phone calls to request documents and materials and urge action, for urgent matters, we should consider sending people directly to negotiate and urge in person at any time. 6. In the document registration procedures, we should study and adjust at any time according to the changes in the organization and work situation. Those that are helpful for document inspection must perform the necessary registration procedures. The use of the above methods is specifically determined according to the specific circumstances of different contents. Due to the application of the above methods, from the receipt to the issuance of documents, except for those that require careful consideration of the issues, most of the documents (about 70% or more) can be completed within the same day or two or three days.
    IV. Implementing a joint office system can improve work efficiency. The former North China People's Government had adopted this method in rural areas. Every week, we would gather in one room to review documents and telegrams, with the assistance of a secretary, who also provided advice. If problems were encountered, they would be discussed and resolved at any time, which achieved certain results. After entering Beijing, the situation changed. Joint office work was more about discussing policy issues, central work, and important administrative matters of various departments. The advantages of joint office work are: 1. Gathering wisdom and pooling efforts helps to solve important problems in work; 2. Problems are solved faster, avoiding the need for relevant departments to consult back and forth, wasting time and delaying work; 3. Exchanging information and sharing experiences allows everyone to understand the overall situation and better arrange the work of their own departments in the entire government work. For daily administrative matters, because joint office work often cannot spare the necessary time for relevant departments to consult and resolve, the method of drafting by the organizing department and sending it to relevant departments for co-signing was adopted. As a result, a document often circulated back and forth, and many of them were circulated back and forth through the secretariat, which felt quite slow. Later, the following methods were adopted: 1. The competent department first sent personnel to negotiate with relevant departments before drafting; 2. After the document is sent to the secretariat, if it is considered necessary to send it to other relevant departments for co-signing, the method of sending personnel to relevant departments to discuss the matter is adopted. After implementation, the situation has improved. In short, it is better to adopt the method of face-to-face consultation for internal affairs of government agencies, otherwise there will be the problem of official documents "traveling" without solving the problem. Of course, it is difficult to have joint office work for large agencies with too many departments, but it can be done in one department.
    V. Office documents must have a strict inspection system. After receiving the documents, they are registered and then assigned to the competent department for handling. The secretarial department must check and urge them at any time to avoid backlogs and delays. Checking and urging should also be carried out regularly and systematically as a system. In order to establish and adhere to this inspection system, special personnel are set up in the organization to ensure implementation. In terms of the methods of inspection work, we used to adopt the registration book method (the content focuses on the registration and inspection of the "processing situation" column), but we felt that it was not scientific enough and the inspection was inconvenient. Later, we changed to the card system. We made a card bag with the names of the organizations that the document must go through vertically and horizontally. After the matter is registered on the card, the card is moved to the department where it is being processed, and the words "urgent" and "important" are marked on the card according to the content of the document (we also plan to use red, yellow, and white paper to distinguish between urgent, important, and ordinary), so that we can check and urge them separately according to their priority every day. Since the trial implementation, we feel that it is better than using the registration book method.
    VI. In addition to handling documents, secretarial staff have the responsibility to provide some administrative work information, prepare preliminary plans, and help leaders to easily decide how to handle problems. This is an important part of the scientification of document processing. Therefore, secretarial staff should often be closely connected with the leaders and strive to learn and improve their theoretical and policy level; at the same time, the leaders must also take into account the nature and characteristics of the tasks of the secretarial staff, give them various assistance to improve their work efficiency, and cultivate the secretarial staff to become the capable assistants of the leaders.
    Secondly, we realize that our government's documents are mainly written for government cadres at all levels and the people, so the text should "generally use colloquial language, and adopt the language that is easy for the other party to accept, depending on the different objects." In terms of format, it is also stipulated that "all official documents should be written vertically from right to left." However, the wording of some documents is still not popular enough, and some departments like to use technical terms, so that people with low cultural levels cannot understand them, which is a major shortcoming.
    VII. Regarding specific business aspects: In terms of document types and processing methods, there are also some good experiences:
    1. In terms of document types: In addition to general orders, letters, reports, etc., in order to adapt to the new work content and new work style of the People's Government, we also adopted the following types of documents:
    A. Reply: Imitating the common memo style, it is a simple method of recording and approving replies, used to reply to reports and requests for instructions from various departments within the government. The procedure is simple and quick, and it can save many processes such as drafting, reviewing, printing, and supervision. If collective office work is implemented, the method of reading and signing can be adopted, then there is no need to reply in writing, which is even simpler and more convenient.
    B. Instruction: When giving guidance to lower-level government agencies in carrying out work, sometimes "instructions" are used to explain in detail the important significance of a task, the principles to be grasped, and the specific steps and methods to be carried out, so as to implement it.
    C. Circular: In order to improve work, leading agencies at all levels must exchange work information, share work experience, and criticize and commend typical events. "Circular" is the most convenient form of official document.
    D. Decision: Used when a decision is made on a specific issue. The form is very simple, and the content can be a hard decision, or it can explain the reasons and specify the specific methods, without restrictions. Once a decision is made, everyone will follow it, and there is no need to distribute it to various relevant agencies.
    Due to the adoption of the above types of official documents, we have solved the problem of the incompatibility between the new content and the old form, and can vividly and actively carry out work tasks.
    2. Regarding the methods of handling official documents:
    A. We implemented a one-matter-one-document system to facilitate review, registration, archiving, and the handling by the recipients.
    B. We widely adopted the "copy to" method: When issuing documents, in addition to issuing them to the competent authorities, we adopted the method of sending copies to relevant agencies, that is, noting after the document "This document is also copied to XX XX XX agency for reference or action" to replace issuing another document. In this way, we overcame the red tape of the old government of having several drafts for one matter, and made the processing and archiving of official documents simpler and more accurate. This is the simplest method to adapt to modern typing and printing technology, and it is a major reform to save manpower and material resources and simplify the processing of official documents.
    C. In terms of official document format and paper: We adopted a certain format. Without a certain format, it is easy to cause chaos. The official document format we use actually has only one type, that is, it indicates the XX agency and document type, document number, notes the matter and the main sending and receiving agency and the copying agency. The matter is explained clearly, the main text is finished, the leader signs, which is quite simple. The paper is also kept consistent, in order to be economical, simple, neat, unified, and easy to collect, bind, check and archive. We do not adopt the old-fashioned extension format, nor do we oppose the guerrilla-style small strips.
    D. We applied the incoming document processing registration form: When receiving documents, we register them on a form when necessary. There are columns such as "proposed handling," "instructions," and "handling," which are convenient for the handlers to provide handling opinions and send them to the leaders for decision-making, and then handle them according to the approval. After the handling is completed, the handling situation is noted in the handling column and archived for future reference. The advantages of doing this are: (1) It can make the handlers think more and exercise their ability to handle problems; it is also convenient for the handlers to provide information and opinions for the leaders to make judgments; (2) Because it is a loose-leaf style, this form is only used for incoming documents that need to be reviewed, signed, and annotated for handling. General documents for archiving are not used. It avoids the disadvantages of printing columns such as "proposed handling" and "instructions" on every piece of paper and wasting paper when not in use; (3) It is convenient to check the handling process. Its disadvantage is that if this form is lost, it is not easy to check. The remedy is to paste this form on the incoming document to avoid loss. The results of the implementation are very good.
    VIII. The secretarial department is the link in the entire government machine. It occupies a pivotal position in the government agency. Its nature and task are to assist the leaders and help various departments handle the government's document work. On the one hand, it acts according to the leaders' intentions, conveys the leaders' opinions to various departments, and reflects the opinions of all parties to the leaders, helping the leaders to communicate the opinions of the upper and lower levels; on the other hand, it must also play the role of helping the leaders to synthesize the opinions of various departments and closely connect various departments. Only in this way can the relationship between the upper and lower levels and all parties be linked into a whole through the work of this link, and become a smooth and accurate machine. The Secretariat of the former North China People's Government has done some work in connecting various departments and closely connecting mutual relations (such as organizing meetings, organizing joint office work, conveying the leaders' instructions, and reflecting the opinions of all parties), thus ensuring the completion of work tasks. But there is a major shortcoming: the connection with the secretarial organizations of various departments is very insufficient, and there is a lack of due understanding and help. We have not frequently solicited opinions, exchanged experiences, and studied and improved secretarial business methods, which has affected the overall improvement of work efficiency (specifically manifested in the handling of official documents, there are often problems due to improper handling, which are returned for re-handling, resulting in wasted time and delayed work). At the same time, it also restricts us from learning from everyone, absorbing new creations from the masses, and concentrating everyone's wisdom to enrich our work experience. This is a problem that deserves attention in the future.
    At the beginning of the founding of the country, the work of various central agencies urgently needs to be established and developed. We provide the above opinions for reference and consultation with all parties.

　　关于机关文书的工作研究
  　前华北人民政府秘书处工作经验介绍
    李剑飞
    为要使政府机关行政效率提高，首先要把机关文书工作做好，在高级政府机关中尤其重要。兹将前华北人民政府秘书处一年来工作经验介绍如下：
    一、我们去年一开始就注意按照实际需要与可能条件，建立公文处理的制度，比较明确的规定了公文处理中的一些办法，包括公文处理、公文种类与行文关系、以及公文格式等等，使文件自收到、分案、研究拟办、核批、撰稿、核稿、缮印、封发、归档等一系列的过程，均有一定的制度可循，并随时根据新的情况，研究改进，逐渐使文件的处理达到有条理，有秩序，准确而迅速，以提高工作效率。特别是在高级领导机关里，部门分工较精细，一件事情的处理，牵涉到其他部门职掌的时候很多，因之文件来往核阅的运行次数，亦远较下级机关为多。高级机关的另一特点是核阅文件的首长较多，因而也使文件兜圈的次数增加。针对这些特点，我们采取的办法是：１、组织联合办公；２、派员与有关部门会商；３、印发各有关部门与首长核阅；４、在掌握文件运行的部门，还必须建立“文件处理情形登记制”，文件转到那里，随时检查登记，这样即可使文件无论运行到那一环，一查便知清清楚楚，可以有效的防止文件的丢失与积压。
    二、公文的处理应实行集中领导，分工负责制。所谓集中领导，是在首长总的意图及统一领导下，处理文件，这样就可以和一定时期的政治任务与中心工作密切结合，使领导上的意图与被领导者的具体工作密切结合，就可以掌握轻重缓急，分别不同情况，确定何者应急办，先办，何者可后办，缓办，以便集中力量，处理当前急务，而不致脱节。就可以照顾各方，掌握全盘，联系和统一各部门间的相互关系，以免各自为政，纷歧抵触。所谓分工负责，是指协助首长处理文件的经办人员，分工办事，各有专责：科里能办得了的事（如一些日常具体事务：照规定刊发印信、索发文件、查询文件已否收到、如何处理的等等），即不必送处处理；处一级能办得了的事（如一些日常例行公文及具体事务事项），即不必呈秘书长核阅；秘书长一般应对例行公事的处理负全权责任，行政首长可以不必事事躬亲处理，而秘书处又运用其秘书处机构办事，逐级负责处理，减少文牍层次之繁，同时加强报告请示制度与检查制度，就能处理恰当。这样做的好处是：即能使文件的处理迅速、准确、效率高，又可以相当的避免了首长们为日常文牍事物所烦扰，而能集中力量于考虑解决全面的更重要的工作，并可以发挥各级干部的积极性，责任心，培养干部独立工作的能力，前华北人民政府后一时期是这样做的，证明是较好的办法。
    三、文书处理必须力求迅速，防止拖延积压。我们的口号是：“今日事今日毕”。遇有紧要事项，不受办公时间限制，尽力突击完成；星期，假日，有专人值班，因此保证了工作任务的迅速完成。但当政府行政事务纷繁时，便难能“今日事今日毕”，故尚须根据文件的性质内容，分别轻重缓急来处理。所以，我们在提出“今日事今日毕”的口号外，同时一面提出“工作要分别轻重缓急：急务、要公，提前办理”。这样适应了人少事繁的实际情况，才能实际地做到了不积压文件。此外，为了不断的提高工作效率，我们还采用了以下的办法：１、对紧急之请示事项，政府内部者尽可能电话答复，外部者用电报答复，需要者随后补发公文；２、对不太重要事项，只用电话答复，并在文件之承办一栏内注明“已于×月×日×时电告××部××同志”，即不另行文。３、根据文件性质与内容，规定了“急件”、“速件”加盖戳记标明，并于呈核时使用不同颜色的卷夹（急件用红色，一般性的文件用白色纸夹），以促起收办人之注意，便于分别缓急来处理。４、内部批复及笺函之类的简单公文，均由原承办人随即缮发，不经过缮印、监校等手续。５、对索要文件材料以及催办等事项除写信打电话外，其紧要者，酌采随时直接派人去当面洽商催促。６、在文件的登记手续上。根据组织机构及工作情况的变动，随时研究调整，其有助于文件的检查者，必须履行必要的登记手续。以上几种办法的使用，是根据不同的内容斟酌情况具体确定的。由于以上办法的运用，使文件自收办到发出，除须缜密考虑问题者外，大部分文件（约占百分之七十以上），能在当日或二三天内办讫。
    四、实行联合办公制，可以提高工作效率。前华北人民政府在农村时，即曾采用此项办法。每周定时集中一室核阅文电，并有秘书协助，兼备谘询，遇有问题，即随时研商解决，收到一定效果。进京后，情况变更，联合办公时更多是商讨政策问题、中心工作与各部门的重要行政事项。联合办公的好处是：１、集思广益，有助于解决工作中的重要问题；２、解决问题较快，免得有关部门再相互往返磋商，费时误事；３、互通情报，交流经验，使大家能借此了解全面情况，得以更好的在整个政府工作中适当地安排本部门的工作。关于日常行政事项，因为联合办公时常抽不出必要的时间由相关部门会商解决，所以就采用了由主办部门拟稿，送有关部门会签的办法，这样一来，，一个文件，往往来回兜圈，并且有许多是经过秘书处往返兜转，颇感迟缓。后又采用以下办法：１、先由主管部门派员迳与有关部门商妥后，再拟稿；２、送到秘书处后，如认为有再送其他有关部门会签之必要时，改采派员持件赴有关部门会商办法。实行以后，情况有好转。总之政府机关内部办事，以尽可能采取面商处理的办法为好，否则便有公文“旅行”不解决问题的弊病。当然，机关很大部门过多的，联合办公有困难，但一个部门中是可以做到的。
    五、办公文必须有严格的检查制度。文件于收到后，即作登记，然后分配给主管部门办理，秘书部门要随时检查催办，不致积压拖延。检查催办并应是经常的有系统的进行成为制度。为建立与坚持这种检查制度，特别在组织上设置专门人员，以保证贯彻执行。在检查工作的方法上，我们过去是采用登记簿办法（内容着重“处理情形”一栏的登记检查），但感到不够科学，检查不便；后改行卡片制，制一卡片袋，横竖详列文件运行必须经过的组织名称，事情登记于卡片后，运行到那一个部门去处理的，即将卡片移置于那一个部门，并在卡片上按文件内容标明“急”“要”等字样（尚拟用红黄白三色纸分别急、要、平），这样逐日分别轻重缓急的去检查催办，试行以来，感到比用登记簿办法为好。
    六、秘书工作者，除承办文书之外，有责任提供一些行政工作情况，先行拟办，帮助首长便于决定问题的处理，这是公文处理科学化中重要的一环。因此秘书工作者应经常与领导上密切连系，并努力学习，提高自己的理论与政策水平；同时领导上也须照顾到秘书工作者的任务性质与特点，给以提高工作效能的各种帮助，培养秘书工作者成为领导者的得力助手。
    其次，我们认识到我们政府的文件主要是写给各级政府干部和人民看的，因此文字应“一般采用语体文，分别不同对象，采用对方所易于接受的语言。”格式方面，亦规定“公文一律采取自右而左直行竖写的形式”。惟有些文件的措词用语，仍不够通俗，并有的部门喜用术语，致文化较低的人看不懂，是一大缺点。
    七、关于具体业务方面：在公文种类及处理方法上，也有一些较好的经验：
    １、公文种类方面：除一般的令、函、呈等以外，为适应人民政府新的工作内容与新的工作作风，我们还采用了以下几种文别：
    甲、批复：仿公用笺式，为简便的录批条复方式，用于批复政府内部各部门的报告请示事项，手续简捷，处理迅速，可省却拟稿、核稿、缮印、监校等许多过程。如实行集体办公，即可采用阅批签知方式，则无须以文字批复，更是简接便当。
    乙、指示：对于下级政府机关在进行工作上有所指导时，有时就使用“指示”，详细解释一件任务的重要意义、应掌握的原则，具体进行的步骤与方法等，以便贯彻执行。
    丙、通报：各级领导机关为了提高工作，必须互通工作情报，交流工作经验及典型事件的批评与表扬，“通报”就是最方便的一种公文形式。
    丁、决定：用于对特定问题有所决定时。形式很简便，内容可作硬性决定，亦可讲清理由，指明具体作法，不受限制，一经决定，大家即依照执行，不必再分行各有关机关。
    由于以上公文种类的采用，使我们解决了新的内容与旧的形式不相适应的问题，而能生动活泼的执行工作任务。
    ２、关于公文处理方法方面：
    甲、我们实行了一事一稿制，以便于核阅、登记、归档、及受文者的处理。
    乙、广泛采用了“抄致”办法：在行文时，除发给主管机关外，对有关机关则采取致送副文性质的抄致公文，即于文后注明“此件并抄致××××机关照办或参考”，以代替另外行文，这样就克服了旧政府一事数稿之繁文缛节，而使公文之处理及存档更为简捷，准确。这是适应近代打字、印刷技术之最简便的方法，是节省人力物力而使公文之处理更简化的一大改革。
    丙、在公文格式及用纸方面：我们是采取有一定的格式的。因无一定格式，易致紊乱。我们使用的公文格式，实际上只有一种，即是标明××机关及文别、字号，注明事由及主致送机关与抄致机关，事情说清，正文完了，首长签署，如此颇称简便。用纸也坚持一致，以合于经济、简便、整齐划一、便于汇订存查归档为原则。既不采取旧式拓页式，也反对游击主义的小条条形式。
    丁、应用了来文处理登记单：收到文件，遇有必要时即挂单登记，上有“拟办”“批示”“承办”等栏，便于承办人提供处理意见，送经首长作决定，然后照批办事，办讫在承办栏注明处理情形，归档存查。这样作的好处是：（一）可以使承办人多用思考，锻炼处理问题的能力；也便于承办人提供情况及意见，供给首长作判断；（二）因系活页式，收文之须要审查签注处理者，始用此单，一般存查文件，即不使用，无每一公文用纸上均载列“拟办”“批示”等栏，而不用时则形成浪费纸张之弊（三）便于检查处理过程。它的缺点是如果此单丢失即不易查考。补救办法是：可将此单粘贴于来文上，以免散轶。实行结果，成效很好。
    八、秘书部门是整个政府机器上的纽带，它在政府机关中处于枢纽地位，它的性质与任务，是辅佐首长及帮助各部门处理政府的文书工作。它一方面秉承首长意图办事，把领导者的意见传达给各部门，把各方面的意见反映给领导者，帮助首长沟通上下级意见；另一方面又要起帮助首长综合各部门意见，密切各部门联系的作用。必如此，才能把上下、各方的关系，靠了这一纽带的工作，联系成为一个整体，成为一部运转自如、准确合拍的机器。前华北人民政府秘书处在联系各部门，密切相互关系方面，曾做了一些工作（如组织会议、组织联合办公、传达首长指示、反映各方意见等），因而保证了工作任务的完成。但有一个大的缺点是：和各部门秘书组织的联系很不够，缺乏应有的了解与帮助，未能经常征询意见，交流经验研究改进秘书业务办法，因而使工作效率整个的提高受到影响（具体表现在公文的处理上，往往有一些文件因处理不当发生问题，退回另办，以致费时误事）。同时也使我们向大家学习，吸收群众中的新创造，集中大家的智慧，来丰富我们的工作经验方面，受到限制。这是值得今后注意的问题。
    当此开国之初，中央各机关的工作，亟待建立与开展，特提供以上意见，备作参考，并与各方商权。
