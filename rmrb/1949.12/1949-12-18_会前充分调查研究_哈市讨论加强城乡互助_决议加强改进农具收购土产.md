Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 15th: The Second Harbin Municipal People's Representative Conference was held recently. According to the decision of the previous meeting, the main focus of this meeting was to discuss strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance. This is one of the most pressing issues for Harbin, as the economic center of Northern Manchuria. In order to ensure a practical solution to this problem, the Municipal People's Government sent personnel to the countryside prior to the meeting to hold farmer forums, study urban-rural material exchanges, the sales channels for native products, and the improvement of new-style farm implements. The Municipal Industrial Bureau, Commercial Bureau, and Cooperative Headquarters jointly organized a rural inspection team, which went to Feiketou and Shangzhi counties to conduct on-the-ground investigations. The Commercial Bureau also studied materials related to Harbin's past urban-rural relations with relevant departments. When the meeting was held, farmer representatives from fourteen counties in Songjiang Province, as well as relevant industrialists and businessmen from the fields of medicine, farm implements, and cart inns, were invited to participate and attend as observers in order to listen to their opinions and demands.

After listening to Mayor Rao Bin's introduction to the central focus of the meeting and the Commercial Bureau Director's introduction to urban-rural relations, the meeting first underwent group discussions, and then a heated debate was launched in the general assembly. The delegates actively spoke on the following issues:

Regarding the improvement of farm implements. The farmer representatives were most concerned about this. One farmer representative said: "Tell our worker comrades, our tools haven't been turned over yet. We want foreign plows, threshing machines, and weeding machines to increase production." The worker representatives unanimously expressed their willingness to assist in the development of rural peace.

The meeting resolved to strengthen the work of improving farm implements, inspect the quality of finished products, allow farmers to sign contracts when buying new farm implements specifying the period of guaranteed use, and allocate funds from the municipal government to help with research work on the transformation of farm implements, and to reward those who are successful. At the meeting, the representative of the Harbin Farm Implement Factory stated that the quality of the forty new-style carts sold to farmers in the past was not good and promised to compensate them. The representative of the Farmer Service Cooperative proposed to send a corn threshing machine to each county and suburban district of Songjiang Province. The municipal government proposed to donate weeding machines. The farmer representatives warmly welcomed this.

Regarding the sales channels for rural sideline products. The meeting focused on discussing and deciding on the adoption of a joint public-private management and sales method for medicinal materials abundant in Songjiang Province. The representative of the Municipal Enterprise Company proposed to organize a unified purchasing and sales organization and was willing to contribute some funds. Representatives of private Chinese medicine businesses and the industrial and commercial sector were also willing to invest. At the same time, the meeting also decided to organize a medicinal materials investigation team to go to various places to understand the types, output, and marketing situation of medicinal materials.

Regarding the reduction of difficulties for farmers entering the city and the problem of unscrupulous merchants defrauding farmers, the meeting decided to establish model markets suitable for the needs of farmers, establish sales procedures, strictly prohibit all fraudulent behavior by unscrupulous merchants, inspect the quality of goods, gradually move towards clearly marked prices, inspect weights and measures, and strengthen the management of small markets. Regarding the management of cart inns, the meeting stipulated various expenses within the inn, prohibited deception and profiteering from farmers, determined grain prices, posted them daily, and abolished secret codes. In addition, detailed discussions were also held on issues such as farmers in the suburban districts of the city collecting manure, rural medicine, and the widespread promotion and introduction of sideline products, and resolutions were made. The meeting finally elected the Harbin Municipal Consultative Committee.

　　会前充分调查研究
    哈市讨论加强城乡互助
  　决议加强改进农具收购土产
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】哈尔滨市二次各界人民代表会议已于日前举行。根据上次会议的决定，这次会议主要地是讨论加强城乡互助。这对于作为北满经济中心的哈尔滨，是最迫切的问题之一。市人民政府为使这一问题得到切实解决，在会前曾派员下乡召开农民座谈会，研究城乡物资交流、土产销路及改良新式农具等问题，市工业局、商业局和合作总社联合组织农村考察团，分赴外县斐克图、尚志两地进行实地调查；商业局更与有关部门研究了哈市过去城乡关系材料。会议举行时，还邀请了松江省十四个县农民代表和医药、农具、大车店等有关工商业者参加及列席，以便倾听他们的意见和要求。
    会议在听取了饶斌市长关于会议讨论中心和商业局长关于城乡关系的介绍后，先经小组会酝酿，再于大会中展开热烈讨论。大会代表对下列问题踊跃发言：
    关于改进农具问题。与会农民代表对此最为关心。有一位农民代表说：告诉工人大哥，我们的工具还没翻身。我们要洋犁、打稻机、除草机，好增加生产。工人代表一致表示愿意协助发展农村和平。
    会议决议加强改进农具工作，检查成品质量，农民买新农具时可订立合同，规定保险用期，并由市府拨出资金，帮助从事改造农具的研究工作，对成功者予以奖励。会上，哈尔滨农具工厂代表提出：过去卖给农民的四十辆新式大车质量不好，要保证补偿。农民服务社代表提出，要送给松江省各县郊区各一台玉米脱粒机。市府则提出赠送锄草机。农民代表对此热烈表示欢迎。
    关于农村副业产品销路问题。会议侧重讨论并决定了对松江省盛产的药材采取公私联合经营购销办法。市企业公司代表提出组织统一购销机构，并愿出部分资金；私营中药业及工商界代表亦愿投资；同时会议还决定组织药材调查团，分赴各地了解药材的种类、产量及推销情况。
    关于减少农民入城困难和奸商对农民欺诈问题，会议决定设立适合农民需要的模范市场，建立卖货手续，严禁奸商一切欺骗行为，检查货物质量，逐渐走向明码实价，并检查度量衡，加强小市管理。关于管理大车店问题，会议规定店内各种用费，禁止对农民欺骗取利，确定粮价，每天挂牌，取消暗码。此外关于市郊区农民捡粪、农村医药及广泛推销和介绍副业产品等问题亦均有详细讨论，并作出了决议，会议最后选出了哈市协商委员会。
