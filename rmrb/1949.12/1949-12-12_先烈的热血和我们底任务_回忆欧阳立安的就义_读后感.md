Title: The Martyrs' Blood and Our Task – Reflections After Reading "Remembering Ouyang Li'an's Sacrifice"

The article "Remembering Ouyang Li'an's Sacrifice" published in the sixth edition of this paper is worth everyone's attention and careful consideration.

When Mr. Guo Moruo came to Beijing after liberation, he was warmly welcomed by everyone. "Immediately after getting off the train," he wrote with deep emotion the line, "How much people's blood, exchanged for this honor."

A reporter said that when the CPPCC was convened, he interviewed a certain general, who repeatedly patted him and said, "Child, victory did not come easily!" He couldn't help but have tears in his eyes. Like that general, a victorious general who has experienced hundreds of battles, in today's victory of the people, can't help but feel both joy and grief. This shows that as long as they are dedicated to the revolution and have gone through those arduous years, who today does not feel this way?

Blood, the blood of the martyrs!

The twenty-three martyrs who were executed together with Comrade Ouyang Li'an, because Hu Yepin, Rou Shi, and Yin Fu were writers of the left-wing literary world at that time, their execution not only aroused the concern and indignation of young people who loved literature and art inside and outside the Party, but also progressive writers, scholars, and scientists all over the world jointly protested to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government. The secret magazine "Red Flag" of the Party Central Committee at that time also recorded the list of twenty-three martyrs, but this is the first time I have read an article with such concrete and vivid reporting as that of Comrade Huang Liwen. In it, we see that before the execution, the eighteen-year-old Comrade Li'an advocated "buying some wine and dishes to eat," not with the negative thought of enjoying himself because he was about to die anyway, but "so that he would have the energy to sing the Internationale and shout slogans during the execution!" And the young writer Hu Yepin asked for a haircut, for what? In order to "look more imposing when the reactionaries take pictures after the execution, and even as a ghost, he will not relax his efforts against the reactionaries." In short, all the martyrs were so righteous and generously dedicated their heads and blood for the motherland and the people.

Of course, in the nearly thirty years under the butcher knife of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the martyrs who sacrificed heroically are countless, and twenty-three is only the smallest, smallest part of them. However, even this smallest, smallest part of the record is enough for us—newcomers, the living—to remember the martyrs and know how to strive and encourage ourselves.

"The fruits of the people's victory are exchanged for the flesh and blood of tens of millions of martyrs." This cannot be used as a fashionable phrase. We should deeply appreciate this bloody history and its specific content. Our task today is by no means how to distribute and enjoy this fruit, but how to consolidate, develop, and strengthen this fruit.

If today there are still people in the revolutionary ranks who are calculating their personal fame and position; or feel that "life is too hard" or "interests do not match" and are creating problems at work; or feel that they are old revolutionaries and should enjoy themselves and become "officials"; and have grievances about something "not being as good as" something else, I hope they will read this article and recall the blood of the martyrs!

In short, whenever a participant in revolutionary work has a personal plan in mind, let them recall the blood of the martyrs and ask themselves what their task is!

　　先烈的热血和我们底任务
  　“回忆欧阳立安的就义”读后感
    亚群
    六号本版刊载的“回忆欧阳立安的就义”一文，是值得大家注意读，细心想一想的。
    郭沫若先生来解放后的北京，大伙热烈欢迎他，“下车伊始”，他即感慨万端地写下了“多少人民血，换得此尊荣”的诗句。
    一位记者说，在人民政协召开的时候，他访问某将军时，某将军屡次拍着他说：“孩子，胜利不是容易得来的啊！”言下不禁眼眶发红。象某将军这样身经百战的长胜将军，在人民胜利的今天，也不免一面欢欣一面悲痛。这说明了只要是献身革命，经过那些艰辛的岁月的人们，今天谁又不是这种心情呢。
    血，先烈们的血啊！
    与欧阳立安同志一齐就义的二十三位先烈，因为当中有胡也频、柔石、殷夫诸人是当时左翼文坛的作家，所以他们的就义，当时不仅引起党内外爱好文艺青年们的关心和愤慨，同时全世界进步的作家、学者、科学工作者都联名向蒋介石匪帮政府抗议；当时党中央的秘密刊物“红旗”杂志上也记载过二十三位烈士的名单，但象黄理文同志这样具体生动的报导的文章，在我还是第一次读到。这当中，我们看吧，十八岁的立安同志在就义之前，他主张“买点酒菜吃”，但不是反正快死了，享受一下的消极想法，而是“以便在临刑时唱国际歌，喊口号有精神些！”而青年作家胡也频同志则要求理一次发，为了什么？为了“就义后给反动派拍起照来更威武一点，就是做了鬼，对反动派也不会放松的。”总之，所有的烈士们都是那样大义凛然，慷慨地为祖国为人民献出了他们底头颅热血。
    自然，近三十年来，在蒋介石匪帮的屠刀下，同样壮烈牺牲的先烈是难以数计的，二十三位也不过是其中最小最小的一部分，然而，就是这最小最小部分的纪载，也够使我们——新来者，未死者——追怀先烈，知道应当如何自奋自勉了。
    “人民胜利的果实是成千万的先烈们的血肉换来的。”这不能当作一句时髦语句使用，我们应当深切地体味这一血的史迹及其具体内容。我们今天的任务决不是如何分配和享受这果实，而是如何巩固，发展，壮大这果实。
    假如今天还有人要在革命队伍中计较一下个人的名位；或者觉得“生活太苦”，“兴趣不合”，而在工作上闹撇扭；或者觉得老子是老革命，应当享受一下，做做“官儿”；以及有什么“不如”什么的牢骚等等的话，我希望读读这篇文章，回想一下先烈们底血！
    总之，凡是革命工作的参加者，一有个人打算的念头时就回想一下先烈们底热血而问一问自己底任务吧！
