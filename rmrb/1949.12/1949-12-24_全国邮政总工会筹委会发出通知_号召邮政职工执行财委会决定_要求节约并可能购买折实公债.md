Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd: The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Postal Workers' Union recently issued a notice calling on postal workers nationwide to implement the decision of the Central People's Government's Financial and Economic Committee regarding the handling of year-end double pay and bonuses. The notice stated: "Under extremely difficult financial and economic conditions, the People's Government is still making every effort to care for the economic interests gained by the working class through long-term struggle, and has made this correct decision that takes into account both public and private interests and is appropriate for the times. We are willing to wholeheartedly support it. Therefore, we have made the following decisions, hoping to implement them together:

(1) Conscientiously study the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Committee on handling year-end double pay and bonuses and the letter to workers from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, raise political awareness, and use a hundredfold of working enthusiasm to develop the people's postal service; and prevent all unnecessary disputes and any possible emotional fluctuations that may be caused, in order to answer the People's Government's concern and love for us.

(2) For workers and staff members whose families have special difficulties that they are unable to solve, they should highly promote the spirit of class friendship and provide appropriate relief to help them overcome their difficulties.

(3) Strive for thrift and oppose waste. When receiving year-end bonuses and monthly wages, in addition to maintaining daily life and solving necessary difficulties, a portion of income should be extracted as much as possible to purchase People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds in order to overcome the country's difficulties and achieve the goal of restoring and developing production.

　　全国邮政总工会筹委会发出通知
    号召邮政职工执行财委会决定   
    要求节约并可能购买折实公债
    【新华社北京二十三日电】中华全国邮政总工会筹备委员会日前发出通知，号召全国邮政职工贯彻执行中央人民政府财政经济委员会关于处理年终双薪、奖金办法的决定。通知称：人民政府在财政经济万分困难的条件下，仍极力关怀工人阶级长期斗争所获得的经济利益，作出这一公私兼顾和适合时宜的正确决定，我们愿竭诚拥护。因此特作如下的决定，希望共同贯彻执行：
    （一）认真学习中央财政经济委员会关于处理年终双薪、奖金办法的决定和中华全国总工会告工人书，提高政治觉悟，用百倍的工作热情来发展人民邮政事业；并防止一切不必要的争议和可能引起的任何情绪上的波动，以回答人民政府对我们的关怀和爱护。
    （二）对于工人和职员家属生活中有特殊困难无力解决的，应高度发扬阶级友爱精神，予以适当救济，帮助解除其困难。
    （三）力求节约，反对浪费。在领取年终奖金每月工薪时，除维持日常生活及解决必要的困难以外，应尽可能抽出一部分收入购买人民胜利折实公债，以克服国家的困难，达到恢复与发展生产的目的。
