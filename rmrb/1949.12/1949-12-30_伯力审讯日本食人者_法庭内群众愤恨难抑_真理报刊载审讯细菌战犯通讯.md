Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: TASS reports: *Pravda* published a dispatch from Khabarovsk on the 27th entitled "News from the Court," describing the proceedings of the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal trying Japanese war criminals accused of preparing and using bacteriological weapons. The dispatch pointed out that these cannibals, now in the dock wearing generals' and officers' uniforms, had intended to pave the way for world domination with the blood and corpses of millions of people. Their inhumanly cruel schemes can only be compared with those of the butchers of the Hitler era and their current imitators, the instigators of new aggressive wars. When the chief prosecutor read the following passage from the indictment, the crowd in the courtroom was filled with irrepressible indignation. The indictment stated: This group of saboteurs secretly brought plague, cholera, typhoid, and anthrax germs to the Soviet border, contaminating reservoirs in order to spread death.

The dispatch concluded: The trial of the main Japanese war criminals in Tokyo only revealed a portion of the atrocities committed by the Japanese militarists. The Americans, who are pursuing the use of weapons of mass destruction, have made every effort to mitigate the guilt of the Japanese war criminals. However, the indictment in this case and the evidence presented by witnesses have silenced those who defend the unscrupulous Japanese war criminals. The defendants pleaded guilty to the charges against them during the trial, and the heinous crimes committed by the defendants have been confirmed by irrefutable documents and witness testimony.

　　伯力审讯日本食人者
　  法庭内群众愤恨难抑
    真理报刊载审讯细菌战犯通讯
    【新华社北京二十九日电】据塔斯社讯：真理报于二十七日刊载伯力通讯，题为“法庭来消息”，描述伯力军事法庭正在审讯被控准备与使用细菌武器的日本战犯的情形。通讯指出，这批目前在被告席上身著将军与军官制服的食人者，曾以千百万人的鲜血和尸体，打算为统治世界铺平道路。他们不人道的残忍的图谋，只有希特勒时代的屠夫和目前他们的模仿者——新侵略战争挑拨者的计划，能与之相比拟。当首席检察官宣读下列一段起诉书时，法庭内的群众，燃起了难以克制的愤恨。这段起诉书说：这群破坏者将鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒和炭疽热尔菌偷偷地带到苏联的边界，沾污蓄水池，以便散布死亡。
    通讯的结语说：日本主要战犯在东京的审判中，仅揭露出日本军阀所作的暴行的一部分。追求使用大规模毁灭人类的武器的美国人，曾尽其最大的努力来减轻日本战犯的罪过。但本案的起诉书和证人所提出的证据，使维护肆无忌惮的日本战犯的人，哑口无言。被告们在审判中对所提出的罪状服罪，被告所犯的滔天罪行，已由无可争辩的文件和证人的证据所证实。
