　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st—The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference victoriously concluded at 7:00 PM today. The conference unanimously passed the following important declarations and resolutions: "Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference Appeal to Workers, Male and Female, of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands," "Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference Letter to Workers and All Laborers of Asian Countries," "Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference Resolution on Establishing a World Federation of Trade Unions Asian Liaison Bureau," "Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference Resolution on the United Nations Mission to South Korea," and "Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference Resolution on National Trade Union Reports." Li Lisan chaired the meeting. First, the head of the Soviet delegation, Soloviev, on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau, presented specific suggestions regarding the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions Asian Liaison Bureau, which were unanimously approved. The resolution stipulates that the Liaison Bureau will be composed of one representative each from the trade unions of China, India, the Soviet Union, and Australia, with the representative appointed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions taking primary responsibility. The Liaison Bureau will be located in Beijing, the capital of China.
　　The resolution of the Representatives Conference regarding the United Nations Mission to South Korea, originally proposed by North Korean representative Park Se-young to the conference. The resolution severely condemns the work of the United Nations Mission to South Korea as effectively violating the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, because it consolidates the anti-labor and anti-democratic rule of the fascist reactionaries in Korea and the American militarists occupying South Korea.
　　The Representatives Conference listened to and approved the trade union reports of China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaya, Vietnam, the Philippines, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, Thailand, Burma, Ceylon, and the Soviet Union. Indian representative Shelvankar, on behalf of the Presidium of the conference, read out a resolution on the above reports, especially calling on China and North Korea to mobilize the activism of the working people and trade unions to accelerate the economic development of these countries, improve the people's lives, and fully strengthen the democratic system. In Asian colonial countries, appropriate methods should be adopted to achieve the unity of the people in order to carry out the struggle for genuine national independence, for democratic peace, and against imperialism and its running dogs. The resolution especially called on the working class of all countries to study and accept the experience of the Chinese people in establishing a national united front and developing armed struggle under the leadership of the proletariat.
　　Indonesian representative Mazono, on behalf of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference, presented an appeal to the workers, male and female, of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands. This righteous appeal demanded that the working class of the aforementioned countries unite and support the oppressed people fighting for freedom and independence, and urged them to resolutely demand that their respective governments withdraw troops from Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, and South Korea.
　　The Letter from the Representatives Conference to Workers and All Laborers of Asian Countries gave the working class of Asian countries a path to liberation. This important document was read by Chinese representative Li Lisan. The document called on the workers and all people of Asian countries to resolutely resist the armed aggression of the colonizers, and to provide all possible support to patriotic people who are waging arduous struggles to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland. At the same time, the document specifically pointed out that the experience of the Chinese people in establishing a united front and armed struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of China should be remembered by the people of all countries.
　　All the representatives unanimously stood up and raised their hands to pass the above resolutions and declarations in a highly enthusiastic atmosphere. When each item was passed, applause and slogans shook the entire venue and lasted for a long time.
　　After Simonne Bertram, the representative of the International Preparatory Committee of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference, delivered a congratulatory speech to the conference, World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant delivered a closing speech to the conference. He pointed out that since the opening of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference on November 16, through the work of the conference, working committees, and drafting committees, this historically significant event has achieved important results. After this conference, workers of all countries will move towards struggle and victory with greater confidence.
　　After Saillant finished speaking, Chairman Li Lisan shouted the slogans: "Long live the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference!" "Long live the complete liberation and victory of all oppressed nations and the working class of Asian and Australian countries!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!" "Long live Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of mankind throughout the world!" and other slogans. The entire venue enthusiastically applauded and responded. All the representatives then sang the Internationale, and at 7:00 PM, the conference announced its victorious conclusion.
　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference opened on November 16 and lasted for sixteen days, holding six plenary meetings. The main achievement of the conference was to show and strengthen the unity of the Asian working class and the international working class, and to point out the path to liberation for the working class and people of the oppressed countries in Asia.

　　加强了亚洲工人阶级与国际工人阶级的团结
  　亚澳工会代表会议闭幕
    决议设世界工联亚洲联络局在北京由中印苏澳工会各委派一人组成
    【新华社北京一日电】亚澳工会代表会议，已于今日下午七时胜利闭幕。大会一致通过了下列重要宣言和决议：亚澳工会代表会议致美、英、法、荷男女工人呼吁书、亚澳工会代表会议告亚洲各国工人和一切劳动者书。亚澳工会代表会议关于建立世界工联亚洲联络局的决议、亚澳工会代表会议关于联合国派赴南朝鲜调查团的决议和亚澳工会会议关于各国工会报告的决议。会议由李立三担任主席，首先由苏联代表团团长索罗维耶夫代表世界工联执行局，向代表会议提出关于建立世界工联亚洲联络局的具体建议，当经全体一致通过。该决议规定联络局由中国、印度、苏联、澳大利亚四国工会各委派一人组成，由中华全国总工会委派的代表主要负责，联络局设于中国首都北京。
    代表会议关于联合国派赴南朝鲜调查团的决议，原案由朝鲜代表朴世荣向大会提出。该决议严厉斥责联合国派赴南朝鲜的调查团的工作实际等于违反了联合国宪章中规定的原则，因为它巩固了朝鲜法西斯反动派及占据南朝鲜的美国军国主义者的反劳工与反民主的统治地位。
    代表会议听取了中国、印度、印尼、伊朗、马来亚、越南、菲律宾、朝鲜北部、朝鲜南部、蒙古、泰国、缅甸、锡兰、苏联各国的工会报告后认为满意。印度代表谢尔凡卡代表大会主席团宣读关于上述报告的决议时特别号召在中国和朝鲜北部要动员劳动人民和工会积极性，加速这些这些国家的经济的发展，改善人民生活，全力增强民主制度。而在亚洲殖民地国家则采取适当的方法，达到人民的团结，以进行争取真正民族独立，争取民主和平和反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。决议特别号召各国工人阶级要研究和接受中国人民在无产阶级领导之下建立民族统一战线和发展武装斗争的经验。
    印尼代表玛佐诺代表亚澳工会代表会议提出了致美、英、法、荷男女工人呼吁书，这一正义的呼吁要求上述各该国工人阶级团结一致支持为争取自由独立而战斗的被压迫的人民，并敦促他们坚决向各该国政府要求自越南、印尼、马来亚及南朝鲜撤回军队。
    代表会议告亚洲各国工人和一切劳动者书给亚洲各国工人阶级指示了一条争取解放的道路，这一重要文告由中国代表李立三宣读，文告中号召亚洲各被压迫国家的工人和全体人民对殖民者的武装进攻，实行坚决的抵抗，对于正在为保卫祖国独立自由而进行艰苦斗争的爱国志士，给以一切可能的支援。同时文告特别提出中国人民在中国共产党领导下建立统一战线和武装斗争的经验应为各国人民所记取。
    全体代表在高度振奋的空气中一致起立举手通过了上述决议和宣言。当每一项通过时掌声与口号声均震荡全场，经久不息。
    亚洲妇女代表会议国际筹委会代表西门·贝特朗向大会致祝词后，世界工联总书记赛扬向大会致闭幕词，他指出亚澳工会代表会议从十一月十六日开幕以来，通过大会、工作委员会、起草委员会的工作，已使这具有历史意义的盛会获得了重要结果，此次会议以后，各国工人将以更大信心走向斗争和走向胜利。
    赛扬致词毕，主席李立三高呼：“亚澳工会代表会议万岁！”、“亚澳各国一切被压迫民族和工人阶级彻底解放胜利万岁！”、“中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！”、“全世界人类伟大导师斯大林大元帅万岁！”等口号，全场狂热鼓掌应答，全体代表紧接着高唱国际歌，至七时，会议宣布胜利闭幕。
    亚澳工会代表会议于十一月十六日开幕，历时十六日，前后举行全体会议六次，会议主要收获就是显示了和加强了亚洲工人阶级与国际工人阶级的团结，并给亚洲各被压迫国家的工人阶级和人民指明了争取解放的道路。
