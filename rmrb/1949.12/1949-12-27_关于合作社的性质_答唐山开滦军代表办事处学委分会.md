　　On the Nature of Cooperatives
　  Reply to the Academic Committee Branch of the Military Representative Office of Kailuan, Tangshan
    Wang Xuewen
    Your letter of November 26th has been received with respect.

    The nature of New Democratic cooperatives is mainly determined by the cooperative's relations of production. In a New Democratic society, they will generally be semi-socialist in nature, with cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature taking a leading position and serving as the direction of development. This is because our cooperatives today are established after the establishment of the people's democratic regime led by the working class. They are mass collective economies established on the basis of private property by organizing farmers and handicraftsmen—small producers—through the power of the people's democratic state. They are closely linked with and managed by the state economy through means such as state economic ordering contracts, loans, and the supply of consumer goods and means of production, becoming a powerful assistant to the state economy, and a bridge to organize and guide small commodity producers to gradually move towards a collective economy from a dispersed individual economy. However, because the cooperative itself is not an independent mode of production, its nature and role are determined by the socio-economic conditions in which it is situated. Therefore, there are feudal cooperatives in feudal society, capitalist cooperatives or cooperative capitalism in capitalist society, and social cooperatives in socialist society. Even in our New Democratic society today, the nature of cooperatives varies depending on their relations of production and their connections with other economic relations. There are capitalist cooperatives, state-capitalist cooperatives, and semi-socialist cooperatives. For example, a production cooperative that is funded by members to purchase means of production or to contribute means of production as shares and implement dividend distribution, and employs workers for production, is a capitalist cooperative, or what Lenin called cooperative capitalism. If it purchases raw materials and sells finished products to the market, and comes into contact with capitalist elements, its capitalist components will develop further. In addition, consumer cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives that distribute dividends according to shares, and credit cooperatives controlled by private monetary businesses, also belong to the capitalist nature. Secondly, a cooperative led by the state economy, if it still has a capital dividend system and the exploitation of hired labor internally, this kind of cooperative cannot be considered a semi-socialist cooperative, but belongs to the nature of state capitalism. Only those cooperatives that are led and managed by the state economy and have eliminated the capital dividend system and the exploitation of hired labor internally, retaining only the members' share capital and the private ownership of the means of production, are semi-socialist in nature because they are still based on an individual economy (private property). This is the direction of development for our New Democratic cooperatives today, and will be the leading cooperative. Capitalist cooperatives used to be widespread in the past, and there are still a considerable number existing today. These are the objects we want to transform. State capitalist cooperatives are a transitional form from capitalist cooperatives to semi-socialist cooperatives.

    During the New Economic Policy period after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, due to the acceptance of capitalist cooperatives inherited from the Tsarist era (cooperatives developed early and were widespread in Russia), and under the conditions of allowing local free trade and the development of private capitalism to a certain extent at that time, the small producer cooperatives placed under the leadership of the socialist economy at that time were considered by Lenin to be a form of state capitalism. This is roughly similar to the situation of state capitalist cooperatives in our New Democratic society today.

    My answer to this question is roughly like this. I wonder what your opinion is? Please let me know!

　　关于合作社的性质
　  答唐山开滦军代表办事处学委分会
    王学文
    十一月二十六日来信敬悉。
    关于新民主主义合作社的性质问题，主要是由合作社的生产关系所决定的。在新民主主义社会里，一般地将是半社会主义的性质，并以半社会主义性质的合作社占领导地位，为发展方向。这是因为我们今天的合作社，是在工人阶级领导的人民民主政权建立后，由人民民主国家政权的力量，把农民手工业者——小生产者组织起来在私有财产基础上建立起来的群众性的集体经济，它由国家经济通过订货合同，贷款，供给消费资料与生产手段等方式，密切与之联系并受国家经济的领导管理，成为国家经济有力的一个助手，成为组织与引导小商品生产者由分散的个体经济逐步去向集体经济的桥梁。但是由于合作社本身不是一种独立的生产方式，它的性质和作用是由于它所处的社会经济条件所决定的。所以在封建社会里有封建的合作社，在资本主义社会里有资本主义合作社或合作社资本主义，在社会主义社会里有社会合作社。即使在我们今天新民主主义社会里，合作社的性质，也由于它本身的生产关系与它和其他经济关系的联系，而有资本主义性的合作社，国家资本主义性的合作社及半社会主义性的合作社等几种不同的区别，例如由社员集资购买生产手段或拿出生产手段作为股金并实行资金分红，雇佣工人从事生产的生产合作社，它就是资本主义性的合作社，或列宁所说的合作社资本主义，如果它向市场购买原料出售成品，与资本主义成份发生联系，则其资本主义成份更其发展。此外如按股分红的消费合作社，供销合作社及受私人金钱业支配的信用合作社，也是属于资本主义的性质。其次受国家经济领导的合作社，如果它内部还存在有资本的分红制和雇佣劳动的剥削，这种合作社也不能认为是半社会主义性质的合作社，而是属于国家资本主义性质的合作社。只有那些受国家经济领导管理并在它内部已经消灭了资本的分红制和雇佣劳动的剥削，只保留社员的股金与生产手段私有制的这种合作社，由于它还是建立于个体经济（私有财产）的基础上，所以才是半社会主义性质的合作社，是我们今天新民主主义合作社发展的方向，并将是居领导地位的合作社。资本主义性质的合作社，过去曾普遍存在过，今天也还有相当数量的存在，是我们所要改造的对象，国家资本主义的合作社，则是资本主义的合作社过渡到半社会主义性质的合作社的过渡形式。
    苏联十月革命以后新经济政策时期，由于接受了帝俄时代遗留下来的资本主义性的合作社（在俄国合作社发展很早并且很普遍），并在当时允许地方性的自由贸易和私人资本主义一定限度的发展的条件下，因此当时被置于社会主义经济的领导下的小生产者合作社，列宁认为它是国家资本主义的一种形式，这是与今天我们新民主主义社会中，国家资本主义性质的合作社的情况大体上是相仿的。
    关于这一问题，我的答复，大体如此，不知您处意见如何？尚希示告！
