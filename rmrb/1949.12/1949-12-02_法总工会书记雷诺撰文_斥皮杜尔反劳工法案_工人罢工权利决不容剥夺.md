　　French General Confederation of Labor Secretary Renault Writes Article
　　Denounces the Bidault Anti-Labor Law
    The Right of Workers to Strike Must Not Be Deprived
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st] TASS, Paris, 29th dispatch: The Bidault government has formulated an anti-labor bill regarding the collective contract system and labor dispute mediation procedures, attempting to intensify the suppression of the powerful strike movement of the French laboring people. Renault, Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, published an article in L'Humanité, criticizing the bill, stating: "This bill is one of the most reactionary in history, and it violates the constitution. No trade union organization, no republican, and no democrat can absolutely accept it. In terms of collective contracts, the bill grants the government, especially the Minister of Labor, extremely broad and highly arbitrary powers. The bill aims to simply abolish the right to strike explicitly stipulated in the constitution, prohibiting strikes during the proposal of mediation and arbitration and during the arbitration process. After arbitration, strikes are only permitted in order to force the capitalists to fulfill the decisions of the arbitration tribunal, but their activities must be limited to enterprise sectors that do not affect the life of the nation. In reality, no enterprise can be considered unrelated to the life of the nation, which deprives workers of the right to strike in the vast majority of cases. As for the arbitration procedure, it is entirely controlled by the government and its senior officials and is extremely brazen."

　　法总工会书记雷诺撰文
　  斥皮杜尔反劳工法案
    工人罢工权利决不容剥夺
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社巴黎二十九日讯：皮杜尔政府制定了关于集体合同制度及劳工纠纷调停程序的反劳工法案，力图加紧镇压法国劳动人民的强大罢工运动。法总工会书记雷诺在人道报上撰文抨击该法案称：“这法案是历来最反动的一个，它是违背宪法的。一切工会组织，一切共和分子及民主分子绝对无法接受。在集体合同方面，该法案给予政府、特别是劳工部长以极广泛和高度专断的权力。该法案旨在干脆取消宪法明文规定的罢工权利，禁止在提出调解仲裁时和仲裁过程中举行罢工。而在仲裁之后，也只有在为了迫使资方履行仲裁法庭的决定的情况下才许可罢工，但其活动还要限于不关系国家生命的企业部门。实际上没有一种企业可以被认为与国家生命无关，这就剥夺了极大多数场合下工人的罢工权利。至于仲裁程序，则完全由政府及其高级官吏支配，是十分无耻的。”
