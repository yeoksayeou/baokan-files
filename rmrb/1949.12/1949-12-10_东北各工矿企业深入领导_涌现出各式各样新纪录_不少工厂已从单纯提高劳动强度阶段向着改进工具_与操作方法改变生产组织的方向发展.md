　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. Thanks to in-depth leadership and close cooperation between workers and technicians, all kinds of new records are emerging everywhere in the creation of new production records campaign in the industrial and mining enterprises of Northeast China. Some departments have successively established "contact contracts" or will gradually determine technical quotas in various aspects; improve production organization; and change the current wage system, so that the management of production can adapt to the new level of production.

　　Before the start of the movement to create new records in the factories of the Power Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the waste of gas, water, raw materials, etc. was very serious, and complete power outages often occurred, resulting in particularly large losses. After the launch of the movement to create new records in these factories, the above situation has changed. Now the power plant has implemented a safe operation responsibility system, eliminating all power outages. The gas plant has increased the pressure of the gas, saving a total of more than 36.6 million Northeast currency units worth of blast furnace gas in October. The water supply plant has improved its equipment, also saving more than 59,000 tons of water, worth more than 162.8 million Northeast currency units. After the melting furnace team of the foundry shop transformed the operation method of melting iron, it created a new record in the history of the melting furnace team of the foundry shop by melting 25 kilograms of iron juice with one kilogram of coke. Since the Northeast People's Government Industry Department convened a mobilization meeting for the creation of new production records, the creation of new production records in the factories of Benxi Coal and Iron Company has developed from the stage of simply increasing labor intensity to the direction of improving tools and operating methods. For example, Qu Linshan, director of the foundry shop of the machine factory, and technician Tian Fengtai led the improvement of labor organization, changing from one iron smelting every three days to one iron smelting every two days, increasing output by 39 percent. The second power plant created a new record of using only 0.77 kg of coal per "dianzi" (i.e., one kilowatt-hour) by studying and mastering the machine and increasing the evaporation efficiency. After a month and a half of research and experimentation, all the workers in the true converter of the Shenyang Smelting Factory tried to increase the air pressure and furnace temperature, so that the 6 percent lead content in the copper matte was fully oxidized, breaking the old rule of the puppet Manchukuo period that copper matte containing more than 3 percent lead could not be treated. This new creation enables the use of a large number of copper ores with more than 3 percent lead content that could not be processed and remained during the puppet Manchukuo period, ensuring that production can continue under the current conditions of limited ore sources. The Fuxin Coal Mine Bureau reduced the daily coal-carrying locomotives of the coal preparation plant from four to three and saved more than 125 million Northeast currency units per month in labor and material costs due to the accurate calculation of labor and train times. In addition, for example, the original yarn consumption rate per bolt of cloth in the Shenyang Weaving Factory has now been reduced to 0.491 percent (the Textile Administration stipulates 2.55 percent); and the cost per bolt of cloth has been reduced by 93,000 yuan.

　　In addition to the above-mentioned examples, new records in improving product quality, increasing quantity, increasing recovery rate, strengthening security work, and correctly establishing mentoring relationships have also emerged everywhere in the movement to create new production records in enterprises in Northeast China. For example, from September 20 to the end of October, 23 percent of the workers in the Motor Factory of the Fushun Mining Bureau created new records averaging more than 300 percent higher than the original quotas in 127 major types of work such as steelmaking, electric motors, and steel molds.

　　Specifically and deeply leading the timely crushing of conservative technical standards

　　The emergence of these various new records ruthlessly shattered certain outdated "scientific" views and conservative technical standards, enabling many production and construction projects in Northeast China to achieve great results. According to the experience of various enterprises, some units, as long as the leadership is good after the movement to create new records is launched, and they do a concrete and in-depth job, stand in front of the movement, guide it in a timely manner, and try to improve various unreasonable phenomena in production, the entire production outlook can be renewed. However, some other units have exposed the fact that their production organization, system, and leadership still cannot keep up with the new requirements as the movement to create new records has developed. As a result, the entire production process cannot adapt to each other and is disconnected. For example, in the production in October of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Factory, although many individual new production records appeared, the overall production task was not completed. In the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Factory, 22 workdays were wasted due to waiting for work and materials on October 26 alone. In order to prevent and correct the continued occurrence of these deviations, in addition to leading cadres going deep into the lower levels, personally grasping the movement, and correctly allocating labor and equipment, some factories have adopted the method of signing contact contracts between production teams, workshops, or various types of work, and working together to complete the overall new production records. Some other factories are trying to solve the problem that various processing procedures cannot be connected. For example, the products made of wool in the Shenyang Wool Weaving Factory in the past need to go through 43 major and minor processes such as wool making, wool spinning, cloth weaving, dyeing, and finishing, and there are no clear standard operating methods and quality standards. Therefore, the quality and output of the next process are generally affected by the poor quality of one processing process or the failure to complete it on time. In order to change this phenomenon, each workshop of the Shenyang Wool Weaving Factory recently signed a chain of contact contracts, forming a chain that guarantees quality and clearly divides responsibilities. In this way, disputes of mutual blaming and unclear responsibilities have been eliminated, and the first-class finished products of the entire factory have increased from 89.4 percent in October to 91.8 percent in November; and the phenomenon of third-class and substandard products has been eliminated. The output of weaving per person per day (9 hours) has also increased from 24.6 meters to 29.95 meters. In addition, collective contracts or contact contracts have been successively signed by Fushun Mining Bureau, various factories under the Mechanical Bureau of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department, and Andong No. 1 Paper Mill, which have effectively promoted the creation of new records.

　　东北各工矿企业深入领导
  　涌现出各式各样新纪录
    不少工厂已从单纯提高劳动强度阶段向着改进工具
    与操作方法改变生产组织的方向发展
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北各地工矿企业部门在创造生产新纪录运动中，由于领导深入，工人和技术人员的密切配合，各色各样的新纪录到处涌现。有些部门已经先后订立“联系合同”，或将逐步确定各方面的技术定额；改进生产组织；改变目前的工资制度，以便使生产的管理工作能够适应新的生产水平。
    鞍山钢铁公司动力部所属各工厂，在开展创造新纪录运动以前，瓦斯、水、原材料等浪费现象十分严重，并时常发生全部停电事故，损失尤大。这些工厂在开展创造新纪录运动以后，上述情况即有所改变。现在发电厂已经实行安全运转负责制，消灭了全部停电事故。燃气厂提高了瓦斯的压力，十月份共节省炼铁瓦斯价值东北币三千六百六十余万元。给水厂改良了设备，也节省水五万九千余吨，价值一亿六千二百八十余万元。铸造场熔解炉班，在改造熔化铁的操作方法之后，便以一公斤焦炭熔化铁汁廿五公斤，创造出该铸造场熔解炉班有史以来的最高纪录。本溪煤铁公司所属各工厂，自东北人民政府工业部召开创造生产新纪录动员大会之后，创造生产新纪录已从单纯提高劳动强度的阶段，向着改进工具与操作方法的方向发展。例如，机器工厂铸造场主任曲林山和技术员田丰泰等领导改进劳动组织，由三天化一次铁，改为两天化一次铁，使产量提高百分之三十九。第二发电厂由于研究掌握机器，使蒸发效率加大，创造出每发一个电字（即一个千瓦小时）只用煤零点七七公斤的新纪录。沈阳冶炼工厂真吹炉全体工人，经过一个半月的钻研试验，设法提高送风压力和炉温，使冰铜中含百分之六的铅质得到充分氧化，打破了伪满时期对于冰铜含铅到百分之三以上即无法处理的陈规。这一新的创造，使伪满时期所不能处理而剩存下的大批含百分之三以上铅质的铜矿石得以利用，在目前矿石来源不多的条件下，保证生产能够继续进行。阜新煤矿局，由于精确计算劳动力和车次的结果，使选煤厂每日的运煤机车从四辆减到三辆，每月即节省劳动力和物力费用一亿二千五百余万元。此外，如沈阳织布厂每匹布的原纱消耗率，目前已降低到百分之零点四九一（纺织管理局规定为百分之二点五五）；并且使每匹布的成本节省九万三千元。
    东北各地企业部门的创造生产新纪录运动，除开上述的一些事例以外，在改进产品质量、增加数量、提高回收率、加强保安工作和正确建立师徒关系等各方面的新纪录，也到处出现。例如，抚顺矿务局电机工厂的工人们，自九月二十日至十月底，即有百分之二十三的人数，在炼钢、电动机、钢模等一百二十七种主要工种中，创造出平均超过原来定额郊能百分之三百以上的新纪录。
    具体深入地及时领导粉碎保守的技术标准
    这些各色各样新纪录的涌现，无情地粉碎某些陈旧的“科学”观点和保守的技术标准，使东北各地许多生产修建工作取得很大的成绩。根据各企业部门的经验，有些单位当创造新纪录运动开展以后，只要领导得好，做到具体深入，站在运动前面，及时加以引导，并设法改进生产中的各种不合理现象，就能使整个生产面貌为之一新。但是，另有一些单位随着创造新纪录运动的开展，便暴露出生产组织、制度和领导方面仍赶不上新的要求。结果，就形成整个生产过程不能互相适应、彼比脱节的现象。如沈阳第一机械工厂在十月份的生产中，虽然出现不少个别的生产新纪录，但是，总的生产任务并没有完成。第二机械工厂在十月二十六日一天中，因等工待料就浪费了廿二个工。现在各部门为防止与纠正这些偏向的继续产生，除领导干部深入下层、亲自掌握运动，正确地配备劳动力和设备外，有些工厂则已采取在生产小组、车间或各个工种之间订立联系合同，共同为完成总的生产新纪录而努力。另有一些工厂，则在设法解决各种加工工序上不能衔接的毛病。如沈阳毛织工厂，过去用羊毛制成的产品，需要经过制毛、纺毛、织呢、染色、整理等大小四十三种工序，又没有明确的标准操作法和质量标准。因此，就普遍发生因一个加工工序质量不好或不按时作完，而影响下一工序的质量和产量。沈阳毛织工厂各车间为改变这种现象，最近连环签订联系合同，形成一个保证质量衔接的连索，明确地分工负责，这样，便消除了互相埋怨、责任不明的纠纷，使全厂的一等成品，由十月份的百分之八十九点四增至十一月份的百分之九十一点八；并且消灭了三等品和等外品的现象。工人们每人每天（九小时）织呢的产量，也由二十四点六公尺增至二十九点九五公尺。此外，如抚顺矿务局、东北人民政府工业部机械局所属各工厂和安东第一造纸厂，也都先后订立集体合同或联系合同，有效地促进创造新纪录运动向前开展。
