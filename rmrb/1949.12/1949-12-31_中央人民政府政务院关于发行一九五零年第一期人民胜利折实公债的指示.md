　　Instruction from the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on the Issuance of the First Phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds
    (A) The 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds, decided upon by the 11th Government Administration Council meeting, will commence issuance on January 5th, with the total amount for the first phase being 100 million shares. Based on the number and size of cities in each major administrative region, the population size, the economic situation, and the progress of work, the sales targets for each region are allocated as follows:
    East China Region: 45 million shares,
    Central South Region: 30 million shares,
    North China Region: 15 million shares,
    Southwest Region: 7 million shares,
    Northwest Region: 3 million shares,
    (B) Due to the continued support for the Liberation War and the need to gradually and systematically heal the wounds of war, the need to supply nine million soldiers and administrative personnel next year, the need to begin preparing various conditions for the recovery and development of the economy, and the slow and gradual increase in fiscal revenue in the newly liberated areas, there is still a deficit in the national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget for 1950. In order to make up for the deficit, reduce the issuance of cash, and systematically withdraw currency, so that the national prices in 1950 reach a gradually stable level, to begin to guarantee the safe and stable lives of people of all classes and the normal development of industry and commerce, it was decided to issue the People's Victory Indexed Bonds. Therefore, the People's Victory Indexed Bonds can be said to be issued for victory, a kind of "victory burden" that all Chinese people should enthusiastically purchase.
    The 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds will issue a total of 200 million shares. Compared with the total national income, the bond figure is very small, but it may play a certain role in overcoming the temporary difficulties we are currently encountering. There is no doubt that the People's Liberation War will soon come to a complete and victorious end. The received Kuomintang troops and other former staff, about four to five million people, will inevitably be transferred to productive undertakings in large numbers within a year or two after education and transformation. In this way, in a year or two, military and administrative expenses will slowly decrease. In 1950, investment in economic construction accounted for about 24 percent of national fiscal expenditure, far exceeding the amount of public debt. In the future, investment will inevitably increase year by year. With the recovery of the national economy, the fiscal situation will gradually improve. At that time, our country's difficulties will be less than they are now.
    (C) The characteristics of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds: (1) Although it is issued to make up for the deficit, it is guaranteed and issued on the basis of national victory, guaranteeing the repayment of principal and interest on time. (2) It is an indexed bond, equivalent to a fixed-term savings. (3) It has interest, with an annual interest rate of five percent. (4) The time is not long; after one year, repayment of principal and interest will begin, and it will be paid off in five years. These benefits provide great benefits to purchasers and open up a legitimate outlet for social idle funds.
    (D) Will the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds cause a sharp drop in prices due to the tightening of credit? Sharp rises in prices are harmful to the people, and sharp drops are also harmful to the people. Therefore, governments at all levels should take all effective measures in the process of promoting bonds to moderate market credit and maintain the normal state of prices. The specific methods are as follows: (1) Financial organs must organically combine financial expenditures with the work of promoting bonds and withdrawing currency. (2) Trade organs should, in light of market conditions, systematically buy and sell materials based on their own strength. (3) Financial institutions should, for the convenience of gold holders to purchase bonds, exchange a portion of gold at an appropriate ratio.
    (E) The main targets for bond sales should be industrial and commercial operators, well-to-do wealthy households in urban and rural areas, and wealthy retired civil and military officials in large, medium, and small cities. At the same time, governments at all levels must carefully distinguish between the large, medium, and small sizes of industrial and commercial enterprises, the large, medium, and small sizes of well-to-do households, and the specific circumstances of industry and commerce during the bond sales process, and rationally allocate sales figures.
    Everyone will agree that farmers in the old liberated areas have already borne heavy burdens in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources during the long-term war, and this year's public grain burden has reached 20 percent of their total income. Bonds cannot be sold to farmers anymore, but voluntary, joint, and small-amount purchases are welcome.
    The People's Liberation Army has always had a supply system, and its life is the most difficult. However, it has always taken the lead in revolutionary movements. Under the principle of voluntariness, it is welcome to purchase bonds, without allocating fixed quotas.
    Urban workers, staff, students, public teachers and staff, and freelancers love the motherland and have never lagged behind. Under the principle of voluntariness, they are also welcome to purchase bonds, without allocating fixed quotas.
    Overseas Chinese have always been enthusiastic about the cause of the liberation of the motherland, and it is hoped that they will actively subscribe.
    To this end, governments at all levels should, during the bond sales process, use various opportunities and occasions, such as people's representative conferences at all levels, various symposiums, trade associations, etc., to repeatedly explain the purpose of issuing the People's Victory Indexed Bonds to patriotic industrial and commercial circles and well-to-do wealthy households, etc., so that everyone, proceeding from taking care of the overall situation and the interests of the broad masses of the people, will actively purchase bonds and contribute to the country to overcome the temporary financial difficulties encountered in the victory of the motherland.
    (F) To facilitate the progress of sales work, people's governments at all levels above the county and city level should organize People's Victory Indexed Bond Sales Committees. The people's government should appoint a dedicated person to be responsible and absorb heads of finance, banks, trade, and other departments, as well as representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and impartial people from all walks of life to participate, responsible for handling sales and publicity matters.
    The sales of People's Victory Indexed Bonds must be carried out in the spirit of democracy, achieving fairness and rationality, and opposing forced apportionment. Each county and city can allocate pre-determined figures according to different industries, and adopt persuasive solicitation and self-reporting and public discussion methods to encourage active subscription. When allocating pre-determined sales figures in each county and city, if each county and city holds a people's representative conference, it should be submitted to the representative conference for discussion and approval.
    From the date of commencement of bond sales work, the major administrative regions and the five provinces and two municipalities directly under the Central Government of North China must report the sales situation to the Finance and Economics Committee of this Council every ten days (on the tenth of each month) without interruption.
    The method of announcing the price of the physical objects contained in each share of the bond will be announced separately.
    (G) Cultural and educational organs at all levels and various people's organizations should, based on the above instructions, use various opportunities and methods to be responsible for carrying out publicity and solicitation.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于发行一九五零年第一期人民胜利折实公债的指示
    （甲）一九五○年人民胜利折实公债，业经本院第十一次政务会议决定，于一月五日起开始发行，第一期发行总额为一万万分。按照各大行政区城市的多寡、大小，人口的多少，经济情况的好坏和工作的进展的程度等，分配各区推销任务如下：
    华东区　四、五○○万分，
    中南区　三、○○○万分，
    华北区　一、五○○万分，
    西南区　七○○万分，
    西北区　三○○万分，
    （乙）由于继续支援解放战争以及必需逐渐地有计划地医好战争的创伤，由于明年必需供给九百万的军队和行政人员，由于必需开始准备恢复和发展经济的各种条件，并由于新解放区的财政收入是缓慢的逐渐增加的，因而在一九五○年全国财政收支概算中还有赤字。为了弥补赤字，减少现钞发行，有计划地回笼货币，使一五○年全国的物价，达到逐渐稳定的程度，以开始保证各阶层人民的安全定生活和工商业的正常发展，才决定发行人民胜利折实公债。因此，人民胜利折实公债，可以说是为了胜利而发行，是一种“胜利负担”，全国人民均应踊跃购买。
    一九五○年人民胜利折实公债，共发行二万万分。公债数字与国家总收入数字相比较，是很小的，但它在克服我国目前所遇到的暂时的困难中，可能起一定的作用。毫无疑问，人民解放战争不要很久将完全胜利的结束。所接收的国民党部队和其他旧职员，约有四五百万人，在一两年之内，经过教育改造，也必然会大批转入生产事业。这样，在一两年后，军政费开支便会慢慢地减少下来。一九五○年经济建设投资，约占全国财政支出的百分之二十四，远超过公债数额，以后投资必然会逐年增加，随着国民经济的恢复，财政状况也必将会逐渐向上好转，到那时，我们国家的困难，当会少于现在。
    （丙）人民胜利折实公债的特点：（一）它虽是为了弥补赤字而发行，但它是有保证的，是建筑在全国胜利的基础上而发行的，它保证可以按期归还本利。（二）它是折实公债，等于定期储蓄。（三）它是有利息的，年息五厘。（四）时间不长，一年之后，即开始还本付息，五年还清。有这些好处，就给购买者以很大的利益，给社会游资开阔了一条正当的出路。
    （丁）发行人民胜利折实公债，会不会因银根抽紧而使物价暴跌？物价暴涨对人民有害，暴跌对人民亦有害。因此，各级人民政府，在推销公债过程中，应采取一切有效办法，使市场银根适度，保持物价的正常状态，具体办法如下：（一）财政机关，必需把财政开支和推销公债、回笼货币的工作，加以有机地配合。（二）贸易机关，应视市场情况，根据自己的力量，有计划地吞吐物资。（三）金融机关，应为黄金持有者购买公债方便起见，以适当的比价，兑收一部分黄金。
    （戊）公债推销对象，主要应放在大中小城市的工商业者、城乡殷实富户和富有的退职文武官吏。同时，各级人民政府在推销公债过程中，又必须审慎地区分工商业的大、中、小，殷实常户的大、中、小及工业、商业等具体情况，合理地分配推销数字。
    大家都会同意，老解放区的农民在长期战争中，人力、物力、财力的负担已经很重，今年公粮负担，又达其总收入的百分之二十，公债不能再向农民推销，但自愿、合伙、小额承购者，也是欢迎的。
    人民解放军向为供给制度，其生活最为艰苦，但它在历来的革命运动中，均起带头作用，在自愿原则下，欢迎其购买，不分配固定额数。
    城市工人、职员、学生、公教人员和自由职业者，爱护祖国，向不后人，在自愿原则下，亦欢迎其购买，不分配固定额数。
    国外华侨，对祖国解放事业，一向热心，希望其踊跃承购。
    为此，各级人民政府，应在推销公债过程中，利用各种机会各种场合如各界人民代表会议、各种座谈会、同业公会等，向爱国的工商业界和殷实富户等，反复说明发行人民胜利折实公债的目的，务使大家从照顾全局、照顾广大人民利益出发，踊跃购买，为国家出一把力，以克服祖国胜利中所遇到的暂时的财政困难。
    （己）为便于推销工作的进行，县市以上各级人民政府，应组织人民胜利折实公债推销委员会，人民政府应指定专人负责，吸收财政、银行、贸易等部门负责人和各民主党派、各人民团体及各界公正人士参加，负责办理推销与宣传事宜。
    推销人民胜利折实公债，必须贯彻民主精神，做到公平合理，反对强迫摊派。各县市可按不同的行业分配预定数字，采取说服劝募、自报公议的办法，鼓励踊跃认购。各县市在分配预定推销数字时，如遇各该县市召开各界人民代表会议时，应提交代表会议讨论和通过。
    各大行政区及中央直属华北五省二市人民政府，自公债推销工作开始之日起，须每十日（按月逢十）将推销情况电告本院财经委员会一次，不得间断。
    关于公债每分所含实物的物价通报办法，另行公布。
    （庚）各级文教机关，各人民团体，应依据上列各项指示，利用各种机会及各种方式，负责进行宣传与劝募。
