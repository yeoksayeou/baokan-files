A Brief Biography of Stalin
    Zhang Zhongshi

    Stalin was one of the founders of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory, a brilliant successor to the cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and the greatest revolutionary theorist of modern times. He was Lenin's close comrade-in-arms. Together with Lenin, he founded, consolidated, and nurtured the new type of proletarian party—the Bolshevik Party—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Together with Lenin, he founded the first socialist country in human history—the Soviet Union—and was the great builder of this socialist country. He was not only the great leader of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, but also the mentor and leader of the working people and all progressive people throughout the world. Therefore, the name of Stalin is today a symbol of the victory of communism, a banner of peace and democracy, and the hope of all the world's workers.

    This year, December 21, marks the 70th birthday of Stalin. To facilitate readers' study and research, a very brief account of his life and activities is given below.

    Family and Childhood

    Stalin, originally surnamed Dzhugashvili, was named Joseph Vissarionovich. He was born on December 21, 1879, in Gori, Tiflis Province, and was of Georgian nationality. His father was a poor shoemaker, of peasant origin. His mother was the daughter of a serf.

    In the autumn of 1888, Stalin entered the Gori Church Elementary School and graduated in 1894, simultaneously entering the Tiflis Orthodox Seminary.

    Early Participation in Revolutionary Struggle

    From the age of fifteen, Stalin participated in the revolutionary struggle, making contact with Russian Marxist groups then residing in the Caucasus. From 1896 to 1897, he led the Marxist groups in the Tiflis Orthodox Seminary, diligently studying "Das Kapital," the "Communist Manifesto," and other works by Marx and Engels, as well as reading Lenin's works opposing the Populists, "Legal Marxism," and "Economism." He led the study of various groups, participated in workers' meetings, wrote leaflets, and organized strikes. At this time, he became a knowledgeable and active Marxist.

    In 1898, Stalin joined the Tiflis organization of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, becoming one of the strongest leaders of the organization. In 1899, he was expelled from the Tiflis Seminary for revolutionary activities.

    From the time Lenin's "Iskra" (The Spark) began publication in December 1900, Stalin fully supported the newspaper's views, had boundless faith in Lenin's revolutionary genius, and advanced along Lenin's path, never deviating from it.

    In March 1901, Stalin was forced to lead a secret life, which lasted until the February Revolution of 1917. In September of the same year, Stalin published a newspaper in Georgian, "Brdzola" (The Struggle), to propagate the ideas of Lenin's "Iskra." Apart from "Iskra," this newspaper was the best Marxist publication in Russia at the time. In the second issue of the newspaper, Stalin published an important article entitled "The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and Its Immediate Tasks," explaining that scientific socialism must be combined with the spontaneous workers' movement, pointing out that the working class should play a leading role in the democratic liberation movement, and proposing the task of organizing an independent proletarian party.

    In November 1901, Stalin was sent by the Tiflis Party Committee to Batumi to establish party organizations. He actively engaged in revolutionary activities here, established contact with workers, formed party groups, set up a secret printing press, and carried out propaganda work in rural areas. In March 1902, he organized and led the famous political demonstration of Batumi workers. Subsequently, Stalin was arrested, but he remained connected with the revolutionary movement while in prison. After a long period of imprisonment, in the autumn of 1903, Stalin was exiled to the village of Novaya Uda, Balagansk County, Irkutsk Province, in eastern Siberia, for a term of three years.

    In exile, Stalin received a letter from Lenin. This was his first correspondence with Lenin. In the letter, Lenin explained to him the party's work plan for the immediate future. According to Stalin's recollection, this letter "left an indelible impression on his mind."

    During the 1905 Revolution

    An economic crisis occurred in Russia from 1900 to 1903, leading to massive unemployment. Coupled with the Russo-Japanese War, this further worsened the lives of workers and peasants, accelerating the arrival of the revolution. On January 9, 1905, the Tsar ordered the shooting of a demonstration by workers in St. Petersburg, which became the fuse for the revolution. Students went on strike, workers went on strike, peasants revolted, and army and navy units mutinied throughout the country, opposing the Tsar's brutality. This is known as the First Revolution in Soviet revolutionary history. Stalin was the organizer and leader of the revolutionary struggle of workers and peasants in the South Caucasus during this revolution.

    He spent almost two years in prison and exile. On January 5, 1904, he escaped from exile and secretly returned to the Caucasus, where he carried out revolutionary activities in Batumi, Kutaisi, Tiflis, Baku, and other places. This was after the Second Party Congress, that is, after the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, and during a period of increasing revolutionary movement in the country. Stalin stood on the side of the Bolsheviks led by Lenin, consolidated the party's existing organizations, established new organizations, actively participated in various debates, resolutely defended the Bolshevik position, and exposed the opportunist ideas of the Mensheviks and other enemies of Marxism. At the end of 1904, Stalin organized a large strike by Baku workers. This strike marked the beginning of a surge in the revolutionary movement in the South Caucasus.

    At this time, Stalin also led the South Caucasus Bolsheviks' secret publication, "Proletariatis Brdzola" (The Proletarian Struggle). In it, he published articles such as "On Differences of Opinion Within the Party," "Letter from Kutaisi," "Reply to Social Democrats," "How Does Social Democracy Understand the National Question?" and "The Proletarian Class and the Proletarian Party," expounding some principles of Bolshevik theory and the national program. Lenin praised "The Proletarian Struggle" at the time, praising its Marxist firmness and its extremely high literary value. From these articles, it can be seen that Stalin was already an outstanding political commentator and a great writer and theorist.

    In December 1905, Stalin represented the Bolshevik organizations in various parts of the South Caucasus at the First All-Russian Bolshevik Conference in Tammerfors (Finland). At this conference, he met Lenin for the first time. In April 1906, Stalin participated in the Fourth Party Congress held in Stockholm, opposing the Mensheviks with Lenin and defending the Bolshevik revolutionary line. Shortly after the meeting, Stalin wrote a book, "The Present Situation and the Unity Congress of the Workers' Party," summarizing the work of the congress and discussing the line adhered to by the Bolsheviks in the revolution.

    After the congress, Stalin returned to work in the South Caucasus. At that time, anarchists of the Kropotkin faction were desperately active in the South Caucasus. Stalin wrote a booklet, "Anarchism or Socialism?", in which he explained in simple and easy-to-understand language what is materialism and dialectics, what is historical materialism, and linked Marxist theory with the actual struggle of the proletariat.

    In April-May 1907, Stalin participated in the Fifth Party Congress held in London. After the meeting, he wrote an article, "The London Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Notes of a Delegate)," in which he expounded the resolutions of the congress, defended the Bolshevik ideas and positions, exposed the liberal bourgeois line adopted by the Mensheviks in the revolution and their liquidationist attitude towards the party, pointing out that Menshevism was in fact the political ideology of the petty bourgeoisie.

    Arrested Five Times

    After the failure of the First Russian Revolution in 1905, until the Second Revolution in February 1917, a total of ten years passed. These ten years were the years in which Lenin and Stalin preserved and consolidated the party, resolutely struggled to implement the Bolshevik line under new conditions, and worked hard to organize and educate the workers. They were also years of particularly persevering struggle against the Tsarist police. From March 1908 to 1913, Stalin was arrested five times and exiled five times, and also escaped from exile four times. Only in the last exile was he released after the February Revolution in January 1917.

    From July 1907 to 1910, Stalin was active in Baku. After returning from participating in the Party's London Congress, he was sent by the Party to Baku, the most important industrial center and center of the Russian workers' movement in the South Caucasus, to work. He carried out the struggle against the Mensheviks and Trotskyites here, turning Baku into a stronghold of Bolshevism. He led the Bolsheviks' secret and public publications—"Bakinskiy Proletariy" (The Baku Proletarian), "Gudok" (The Whistle), and "Bakinskiy Rabochiy" (The Baku Worker). He led the election campaign for the Third State Duma (Parliament). On March 25, 1908, Stalin was arrested. After eight months in prison, he was exiled to Solvychegodsk in Vologda Province for a term of two years. On June 24, 1909, he escaped and returned to work in Baku.

    On March 23, 1910, Stalin was arrested again in Baku. After half a year in prison, he was again exiled to Solvychegodsk. This time, he established contact with Lenin from exile, and wrote to Lenin at the end of 1910, expressing his support for Lenin's strategy of organizing all those who advocated preserving and consolidating the secret proletarian party into a Defender of the Party League.

    From the second half of 1911, Stalin began his period of work in St. Petersburg. On September 6 of that year, he escaped from exile and went to St. Petersburg, where he made contact with the party organization, united and consolidated the Bolshevik organization, and carried out the struggle against the Liquidators, Mensheviks, and Trotskyites. On September 9, he was arrested again, and after being detained for three months, was again exiled to his original place of exile.

    In January 1912, at the Party's Prague Conference, based on Lenin's proposal, Stalin was elected to the Central Committee in absentia, and presided over the Central Russian Bureau, which was organized to lead all party work in the country.

    On February 29, 1912, Stalin escaped from exile again. In a very short period of time, he did a lot of work: he inspected important areas of Russia on behalf of the Central Committee; prepared for the upcoming "May Day movement"; wrote the famous Central Committee "May Day" leaflet; and led the St. Petersburg Bolshevik weekly "Zvezda" (The Star) during the Lena strike. At that time, on Lenin's instructions, Stalin initiated the founding of "Pravda" (The Truth), the first issue of which was published on May 5, 1912. The publication of "Pravda" "laid the foundation for the Bolshevik victory in 1917" (Stalin's words at the tenth anniversary of "Pravda"). Therefore, to commemorate the birth of "Pravda," the Soviet government later designated this day as Workers' Press Day.

    On April 22, 1912, Stalin was arrested in St. Petersburg. After several months in prison, he was exiled to the Narym Territory for a term of three years. On September 1 of that year, Stalin escaped from exile and returned to St. Petersburg, where he edited "Zvezda" and "Pravda," and led the Bolsheviks' activities in the election campaign for the Fourth State Duma.

    In 1912-1913, Stalin wrote the book "Marxism and the National Question." Stalin's book is a manifesto of Bolshevism on the theory and program of the national question. Here, he simply and clearly explained the two programs and two worldviews on the national question: the Second International and Leninism. Lenin attached great importance to this book. At the time, he wrote: "Recently, in the Marxist theoretical literature, ... the basis of the Social Democratic national program has been explained in detail (Stalin's article is the first in this regard)."

    In February 1913, Stalin was arrested again in St. Petersburg and exiled to the Turukhansk Territory in eastern Siberia for a term of four years. He spent the years 1914, 1915, and 1916 here.

    The imperialist war broke out in August 1914. The social democratic parties of various countries belonging to the Second International all betrayed the cause, and only Lenin, only the Bolsheviks, remained loyal to the banner of internationalism. At this time, although Stalin was isolated from the world, from Lenin, and from the Party Central Committee in exile, he still adhered to Lenin's internationalist position on issues of war, peace, and revolution. He tirelessly carried out revolutionary work in exile. He wrote letters to Lenin; he exposed the Mensheviks and Trotskyites; and he denounced Kamenev's betrayal during the trial of the Bolshevik deputies of the Fourth State Duma at a conference of Bolshevik political prisoners.

    In December 1916, Stalin was mobilized into the army and taken to the village of Achinsk. On March 8 of the following year, he learned of the February Revolution, returned to St. Petersburg, where he led the activities of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee and the St. Petersburg City Committee, and edited "Pravda."

    During the October Revolution

    In the Second Revolution—the February Revolution—the Tsarist autocracy was overthrown. But under the rule of the bourgeois Provisional Government, the unjust imperialist war continued, the peasants did not get land, and the workers did not have bread to eat. On the other hand, in Russia at that time, alongside the bourgeois government, there was another regime—the Soviet of Workers and Soldiers, which was a united organization of workers and peasants against the Tsarist regime, and also their political organ—the organ of dictatorship. Thus, after the February Revolution, Russia became a situation in which two regimes coexisted.

    On April 3, 1917, Lenin ended his long exile and returned to Russia. On the same day, he published the famous "April Theses," stipulating the Party's new course of struggle under new conditions: transforming the bourgeois revolution into a socialist revolution. On April 24 of the same month, the Bolsheviks convened the Seventh Party Congress, announcing that Lenin's theses would be the basis for the work of the congress.

    Stalin resolutely supported Lenin's line at this congress. He also made a report on the national question, stating the Bolsheviks' national policy, which guaranteed the support of all oppressed nations for the Bolshevik Party in the October Socialist Revolution.

    In May 1917, the Bolshevik Party Central Committee established the Political Bureau, and Stalin was elected as a member of the Political Bureau. From this time on, Stalin has been a member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee. At the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets in June, Stalin was elected to the Central Executive Committee (government).

    Day by day, Stalin became the central figure in leading the practical work of the entire Bolshevik Party. As a member of the Central Committee, he directly guided the work of the Petrograd City Committee, led the work of "Pravda," and often published articles in "Pravda." In July, Lenin had to go into hiding due to persecution by the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. Stalin then led the secretly held Sixth Party Congress, at which he delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee and a report on the current situation, clearly stipulating the tasks, tactics, and guidelines for armed uprising for the Party to strive for a socialist revolution.

    In August, General Kornilov revolted, attempting to restore the Tsarist system. The failure of this reckless rebellion opened a new stage of the revolution. Stalin visited Lenin, who was in hiding, twice. The two were convinced that the period of attack was imminent and determined to intensify preparations for the armed uprising. Stalin directly led all the preparatory work for the armed uprising. He often called representatives of the Party organizations in various regions to give instructions and set specific combat tasks. On October 16, the Party Central Committee elected the headquarters for the Party's leadership of the armed uprising, with Stalin in charge. This headquarters became the leading core of the Petrograd Soviet Revolutionary Military Committee, which in fact led the entire armed uprising. At the two meetings of the Party Central Committee on October 10 and 16, Stalin resolutely supported Lenin's line of armed uprising, and denounced the treacherous actions of Zinoviev and Kamenev, who opposed attacking the enemy.

    On October 24, 1917 (November 6 according to the Gregorian calendar), Kerensky, the head of the Provisional Government, ordered the closure of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee's newspaper "Rabochiy Put" (The Worker's Path). This served as the fuse for the revolution. On the evening of the same day, revolutionary troops and Red Guards held an uprising in Petrograd. The next day, they captured all railway stations, post offices, telegraph offices, and government ministries. In the evening, they captured the Winter Palace, where the Provisional Government was hiding, and arrested the Provisional Government personnel. At the same time, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened that evening, announcing the transfer of all power to the Soviets, and establishing the first People's Committee (government), with Lenin as chairman. Thus, the great October Socialist Revolution was victorious.

    After the establishment of the Soviet government, Stalin served as the People's Commissar for Nationalities Affairs until 1923. He directly led the Party and the Soviet regime in handling all work related to national issues within the Soviet Union. Therefore, like Lenin, Stalin was the advocate and organizer of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

    During the Civil War

    After the Russian landlords and capitalists were overthrown by the October Revolution, they carried out counter-revolution, colluding with foreign capitalists to launch armed intervention in their own country's revolution. Thus, the period of civil war in Soviet history was opened. During this period, Stalin was the direct instigator and organizer of the revolutionary army's major victories in various battles. Wherever the most critical moment was, wherever the victory or defeat of the revolution was decided on the battlefield, Stalin appeared there. Wherever Stalin went, victories were won.

    In the spring of 1918, the foreign British and French imperialists formed the "Czechoslovak Legion" from Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war to invade; British troops landed in Murmansk in the north; at the same time, the remnants of the Tsarist army, White Guards, and Socialist Revolutionaries rioted in twenty-three cities in the Volga River basin in response; and Left Socialist Revolutionaries held a riot in Moscow. The revolutionary capital was cut off from the grain-producing regions of Ukraine and Siberia, and grain could only be obtained from the lower reaches of the Volga River and the North Caucasus in the southeast. To get to these places, it was necessary to pass through Tsaritsyn. Only by holding Tsaritsyn could grain be obtained and the revolution saved. At this critical moment, Lenin sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to serve as the chief commander of grain affairs. After arriving here, Stalin resolutely purged the White Guard conspirators in the city, obtained a large amount of grain, and presided over the defense of Tsaritsyn. As a result, Stalin defended this strategic point and thwarted the White Army's attempt to invade Moscow.

    At the end of 1918, the Eastern Front around Perm was in great danger. General Kolchak's troops were desperately attacking, trying to join forces with the British troops attacking from the north. Stalin was sent to salvage the situation. In the south—in the Tsaritsyn area—he prevented the counter-revolutionary forces in the Don region from joining forces with the counter-revolutionary forces in the Ural region and along the Volga River; in the north, he prevented the interventionist forces from joining forces with the Czech troops and Kolchak's troops. Thus, the Red Army defeated Kolchak, whose northern and southern armies were isolated from the Allies, in one fell swoop.

    In May 1919, General Yudenich, supported by the troops of Finland and Estonia and the British fleet, launched a fierce attack on Petrograd, attempting to tie down the Red Army's attack on Kolchak. At the same time, a mutiny broke out at the Kronstadt fortress in the rear of the Red Army. The Red Army's front line wavered, and the enemy rushed to the city of Petrograd. Stalin was sent here. He quickly eliminated the panic, used infantry in coordination with the fleet, and attacked from both land and sea, recapturing the two rebel fortresses, annihilating the White Army, and defeating Yudenich's White Army. The threat to Petrograd was lifted.

    In the summer of 1919, while the Red Army on the Eastern Front was attacking Kolchak, General Denikin occupied the Donbass mining area and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Polish White Army also came to Denikin's aid and occupied Minsk. The enemy advanced on the capital Moscow from all directions. People were panicking and the situation was extremely dangerous. The most ferocious enemy among them was Denikin. At that time, Lenin called out: "Everyone go against Denikin!" Stalin arrived at this most urgent Southern Front. He quickly reorganized the troops, formulated a combat plan, selected commanders and political workers, personally supervised the battle, and corrected mistakes in a timely manner. In this way, the Red Army fundamentally annihilated Denikin's White Army and reversed the situation.

    On November 27, 1919, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (government), on Lenin's proposal, awarded Stalin the "Order of the Red Banner" to commend his meritorious service on the various fronts of the civil war.

    In May 1920, the Polish aristocrats, with the support of the imperialists, launched the third offensive against the Soviet Union. Stalin was again sent to the Southwestern Front to resist the Polish White Army. Here, he directly led the Red Army to defeat the Polish White Army, recovering Kiev and other places, and turning the Red Army to the offensive. In November of the same year, Wrangel's White Army, with the support of the imperialists, invaded Ukraine from Crimea. Stalin presided over the work of defending southern Ukraine against Wrangel's invasion and formulated a plan to annihilate Wrangel's White Army. As a result, the latter was annihilated. At this point, the revolutionary war after the October Revolution won a basic victory.

    Being good at organizing party members and the masses of workers, being courageous to take responsibility, relying on the masses, ruthlessly breaking down sabotage activities, using an iron fist to suppress the conspiracies of traitors, bandits, and spies in the front and rear, improving the fighting spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and Red Army soldiers through exemplary courageous work and clear revolutionary prospects, being good at discerning and fundamentally breaking down the enemy's most ingenious and dangerous strategic plans - these are the important reasons for Stalin's invincibility in previous battles.

    During the Recovery Period

    After the victory of the civil war, the Soviet Union entered a period of recovery and development of the national economy. To achieve this goal, Lenin proposed a new policy—the New Economic Policy (NEP). At the beginning of this period, Trotskyites and other anti-Party groups such as the "Workers' Opposition," the "Democratic Centralists," and the "Left Communists" colluded together to obstruct the implementation of the Party's new policy under various pretexts. Stalin, together with Lenin, defended the Party's line and crushed these anti-Party enemies.

    On April 3, 1922, the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee elected Stalin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee on Lenin's proposal. From that time on, Stalin has held this position.

    The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was organized by Stalin during these years. Initially, Stalin carried out a great deal of work to establish the Soviet republics of various nationalities, and then, on December 30, 1922, at the First All-Union Congress of Soviets, a decision was passed by Lenin and his proposal to unite the Soviet nationalities on a voluntary basis in state relations to become the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

    On January 21, 1924, the founder and leader of the Bolshevik Party—Lenin—passed away. Stalin became the most reliable and strongest successor to Lenin's cause, and the Leninist core of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee and the entire Party united around Stalin. At the memorial meeting for Lenin at the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets on January 26, Stalin read the famous great oath: to maintain the purity of the great title of Communist Party member; to protect the unity of the Party; to protect and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat; to strive to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; to consolidate and expand the Soviet Union; to consolidate the Red Army; and to be faithful to the principles of the Communist International.

    In 1924, Stalin published "The Foundations of Leninism," which gave a brilliant explanation and profound theoretical exposition of Leninism. This work armed the Soviet people ideologically and also armed the working people of the world.

    During the Period of Industrialization

    In December 1925, the CPSU held the Fourteenth Congress. In his political report, Stalin determined that national socialist industrialization was the Party's general line. He said: "To transform our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country that produces the necessary equipment with its own strength is the essence of our general line and the basis of our general line." After that, he led the Soviet people to the path of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization.

    From 1926 onwards, under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet people embarked on the stage of national industrialization. Stalin first stipulated that the essence of industrialization was not to develop any industry casually, but to develop heavy industry, first of all to develop the machine-building industry, which is the core of heavy industry, because only by creating heavy industry and the country's own machine-building industry can the material foundation of socialism be created, making the Soviet Union independent of the capitalist world, and establishing a technical foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture. The basic tasks of implementing industrialization are to improve labor productivity, reduce costs, strengthen labor discipline, and practice economy.

    At this time, the imperialists tried to sabotage and tried to sabotage the Soviet Union's industrialization, such as announcing the severance of commercial relations with the Soviet Union (Britain), and assassinating the Soviet ambassador to the Soviet Union (Poland). The Trotskyites, Zinoviev, and the remnants of those anti-Party groups that had been defeated before united again to oppose the CPSU's general line. Stalin led the Soviet people to ideologically and organizationally defeat the Trotsky-Zinoviev alliance. He delivered a report on "The Social Democratic Tendency in Our Party" at the Fifteenth Party Congress of the CPSU (November 1926); and then delivered a report on "More on the Social Democratic Tendency in Our Party" at the Seventh Enlarged Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (December 1926). These two reports armed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, and the Communist International ideologically, guaranteeing the unity of the CPSU ranks.

    Transforming old factories, building new factories, and every issue in every sector of industrialization was personally considered, formulated, and resolved by Stalin. In less than two years, by December 1927, the socialist industrialization policy had achieved remarkable success. At the Fifteenth Party Congress of the CPSU held in that month, Stalin made a summary report, determined to expand and consolidate the socialist economic lifeline, and adhered to the policy of eliminating capitalist elements in the national economy. At the same time, he elaborated on the situation in which Soviet agriculture lagged behind industry, pointing out that if the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy was not implemented, the Soviet army and urban residents would starve, and the national economy could not develop. Therefore, he proposed a new task of fully developing agricultural collectivization.

    However, at this time, Bukharin, Rykov, and Tomsky, these right-leaning opportunists, came out again to desperately oppose the Party's line. So Stalin led the Soviet people to defeat these rightists. In October 1928, he delivered a speech on "The Right-Leaning Danger in the CPSU" at a joint meeting of the Moscow Provincial Committee and the Supervisory Committee, and in April 1929, he delivered a speech on "The Right-Leaning in the CPSU" at the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee. In these two speeches, he exposed the right-leaning elements as enemies of Leninism and agents of the rich peasants in the Party.

    During this period, Stalin also published many reports or articles on the Chinese revolution, such as "The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution" (November 1926), "The Question of the Chinese Revolution" (April 1927), "Talks with Students of Sun Yat-sen University" (May 1927), "The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Communist International" (May 1927), "About China" ("Brief Comments on Current Affairs") (July 1927), "About China" (August 1927), etc. In these reports or articles, Stalin made brilliant analyses and predictions about the nature, driving force, tasks, and prospects of the Chinese revolution. The great victory of the Chinese revolution today proves the correctness of these analyses and predictions by Stalin.

    During the Period of Agricultural Collectivization

    From 1930 onwards, the Soviet Union entered the stage of agricultural collectivization. Between 1928 and 1929, a large number of peasants had joined collective farms; at the same time, as a result of the implementation of the national industrialization policy, socialist industry was able to supply various machines to agriculture. Therefore, on December 27, 1929, Stalin delivered a speech at the Conference of Experts on Marxist Agrarian Problems, in addition to exposing the bourgeoisie's so-called "balance" theory of various parts of the national economy, the anti-Marxist so-called "natural flow" theory of socialist construction, and the anti-Marxist so-called "stable" theory of the small-scale peasant economy, he also profoundly analyzed the essence of the collective farm, this socialist economic form, and proposed the implementation of comprehensive agricultural collectivization, "from the policy of restricting the exploitation tendencies of the rich peasants to the policy of eliminating the rich peasant class." Moreover, Stalin, proceeding from reality, determined that the basic form of the collective farm was the labor association; the principle of voluntary participation of peasants in the collective farm.

    In the agricultural collectivization movement, individual regions and individual cadres made deviations; some violated the principle of voluntariness and forced peasants to join collective farms; some suffered from acute illness and wanted to skip the form of labor association and directly run agricultural communes, forcing houses, small livestock, poultry, etc. to be collectivized. Stalin wrote articles such as "Dizzy with Success" and "Reply to Comrades on Collective Farm Work" before and after, pointing out the root causes of these errors on the peasant question and resolutely correcting them. On February 19, 1933, he delivered a speech at the First All-Union Congress of Shock Workers of Collective Farms, calling for "turning all collective farms into Bolshevik collective farms" and "turning all collective farmers into people living in abundance." His speech was deeply imprinted in the hearts of millions of collective farmers in the Soviet Union and became the actual combat program of the collective farms.

    By the end of 1934, the Soviet collective farm had become a strong and invincible force. At that time, the number of participating peasant households had reached three-quarters of the total, and the cultivated area had reached 90% of the total. "This is an extremely profound revolution, a sudden change from the old social state to the new social state. In terms of its results, it is of equal significance to the October Revolution of 1917." ("History of the CPSU" Chapter 11)

    At the beginning of 1934, in his work report to the Seventeenth Congress of the CPSU, Stalin summarized the victory of socialism, pointing out that the socialist economic structure had become the monopolistic ruling force in the Soviet national economy—all other economic structures had declined; and pointed out that the collective farm had already won a final and eternal victory. He put forward the task of eliminating the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness.

    During the Period of Completing Socialist Construction

    From 1935 to 1940, in the history of Soviet socialist construction, it was called the period of completing socialist construction.

    As a result of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, at the beginning of this period, the Soviet national economy possessed the most advanced technology in the world: industry had many machines, machine tools, and other new production tools; agriculture had the first-class tractors, combine harvesters, and various other complex agricultural machines produced in the country; the Red Army had new-style sophisticated technical equipment—artillery, tanks, aircraft, warships; the transportation industry had first-class cars, locomotives, ships, and aircraft, etc. At this time, the basic link was the need for talents who were proficient in these technologies. "Without talents proficient in technology, technology is a dead thing" (Stalin). Therefore, Stalin delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of students of the Red Army Academy in May 1935, putting forward the slogan "Cadres decide everything."

    The advanced workers of the Soviet Union were the first to respond to Stalin's call. The Stakhanov movement swept the country. Subsequently, hundreds of thousands of labor heroes and model workers appeared in all sectors of the national economy. Stalin delivered a report on "The Historical Significance and Tasks of the Stakhanov Movement" at the First All-Union Congress of Stakhanovite Workers in November 1935, pointing out the significance of this movement, "is that this movement can break the old technical standards that are not sufficient, and often exceeds the labor productivity of advanced capitalist countries, thus creating practical conditions for our country to further consolidate the socialist system and turn our country into the most abundant country"; and said that this movement opened the road to communism.

    On November 25, 1936, Stalin reported on the draft of the new constitution at the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, explaining the major changes that had taken place in the Soviet Union since the adoption of the constitution in 1924 and the content of the new constitution. The new constitution recorded all the achievements of Soviet socialist construction.

    In 1938, Stalin wrote the book "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," which was reviewed and approved by a special committee of the CPSU Central Committee. This is a true encyclopedia of basic knowledge of Marxism. In this book, Stalin, with his profound and thorough pen, explained and synthesized the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially in the section "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," he gave a supremely concise and unique description of the basic principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. "This is the most widely disseminated Marxist work since Marxism." (Zhdanov)

    In March 1939, the CPSU held the Eighteenth Congress. Stalin made a work report. In this report, he made a profound analysis of the Soviet Union's international status, exposed the plans of those who tried to provoke war and launch anti-Soviet armed intervention, and determined the four principles of Soviet foreign policy. At the same time, he described the various successes of Soviet socialist construction, the growth of the socialist economy, the improvement of the people's material and cultural life, the further consolidation of the Soviet system, and put forward a new great historical task to the Soviet people: to catch up with and surpass the major capitalist countries in economic relations, that is, in terms of industrial output per capita, within the next ten to fifteen years. In this report, Stalin also further developed Lenin's theory of socialist revolution, specified the doctrine that socialism can be built in one country, and came to the conclusion that communism can still be built in the Soviet Union even if the capitalist encirclement still exists; he also analyzed the various stages of development of socialist countries, explaining how the functions of socialist countries change with changing conditions, and came to the conclusion that if the capitalist encirclement continues to exist, the state must still be preserved in communist society. These conclusions and instructions of Stalin have further enriched Marxism-Leninism and armed the Soviet working class and the working class of the world with new ideological weapons.

　　斯大林传略
    张仲实
    斯大林是马克思列宁主义革命学说的奠基人之一，是马、恩、列事业的天才的继续者，是现代最大的革命理论家。他是列宁的亲密战友，他同列宁在一起，创立、巩固、培植了无产阶级的新型政党——布尔什维党——苏联共产党。他和列宁在一起创立了人类历史上头一个社会主义国家——苏联，并且是这个社会主义国家的伟大建设者。他不仅是苏联各族人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界劳动人民和一切进步人们的导师和领袖。所以，斯大林的名字，在今日就是共产主义胜利的象征，是和平与民主的旗子，是全世界劳动者的希望。
    今年十二月二十一日正是斯大林七十寿辰。为了便利读者学习和研究起见，把他的生活和活动极简略地叙述于下。
    家庭和童年时代
    斯大林，原姓朱加施维里，名字叫约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇。一八七九年十二月二十一日生于梯弗里斯省哥里城，是格鲁吉亚族。父亲是个穷皮鞋匠，农民出身。母亲是一个农奴的女儿。
    一八八八年秋，斯大林进入哥里城教会小学念书，一八九四年毕业，同时升入梯弗里斯城正教中学。
   早年参加革命斗争
    从十五岁起，斯大林就参加了革命斗争，与当时住在高加索的俄国马克思主义者小组发生联系。一八九六——一八九七年，他领导梯弗里斯城正教中学各马克思主义小组，努力研读“资本论”、“共产党宣言”及马、恩其他著作，并阅读列宁反对民粹派，反对“合法马克思主义”、反对“经济主义”的一些著作。他领导各小组的学习，参加工人会议、写传单，组织罢工。这时他就成了一个学识渊博和积极行动的马克思主义者。
    一八九八年，斯大林加入俄国社会民主工党梯弗里斯组织，成为该组织中最坚强的领导者之一。一八九九年，因革命活动，他从梯弗里斯中学被开除学籍。
    从列宁主编的“火星报”在一九○○年十二月创刊时起，斯大林就完全拥护该报的主张，无限信任列宁的革命天才，并循着列宁的道路前进，从未离开这条道路。
    一九○一年三月，斯大林被迫过起秘密生活，直到一九一七年二月革命止。同年九月，斯大林用格鲁吉亚文办了一个“斗争报”，宣传列宁“火星报”的思想。除了“火星报”外，这个报是当时俄国最好的马克思主义的刊物。在该报第二期上，斯大林发表了一篇重要论文，题为“俄国社会民主工党及其最近的任务”，说明科学的社会主义必须与自发的工人运动结合起来，指出工人阶级应在民主解放运动中起领导作用，并提出组织独立的无产阶级政党的任务。
    一九○一年十一月斯大林由梯弗里斯党委派至巴土姆去建立党的组织。他在这里积极进行了革命活动，与工人建立了联系，成立了党的小组，办了一个秘密印刷所，并在农村进行宣传工作。一九○二年三月，他组织和领导了巴土姆工人的有名的政治性示威。此后，斯大林被捕，但他囚在狱中仍未与革命运动断绝关系。经过长期的囚居，于一九○三年秋，斯大林被放逐到西伯利亚东部伊尔库茨克省巴拉干县新乌达村，期限三年。
    在流放地，斯大林接到了列宁的一封信。这是他与列宁第一次的来往。列宁在信里向他说明了党在最近时期的工作计划。据斯大林的回忆说，这封信在他的“脑海里留下了一个不可磨灭的印象”。
    在一九零五年革命中
    一九○○年至一九○三年俄国发生经济危机，大量失业，加上俄日战争，这就更加恶化了工人农民的生活，加速了革命的到来。一九○五年一月九日，沙皇下令开枪射击彼得堡工人的示威游行，这就成了革命的导火线。全国各地学生罢课、工人罢工、农民起义、海陆军部队起义，反对沙皇的这种暴行。这年十二月莫斯科工人更举行了武装起义。这在苏联革命史上叫做第一次革命。斯大林在这次革命中是南高加索工农革命斗争的组织者和领导者。
    他在监狱和流放中度了几乎两年之久，于一九○四年一月五日从流放地逃走，潜回高加索，在巴土姆、库泰斯、梯弗里斯、巴库等地进行革命活动。这已是在党的第二次代表大会以后，即在党分裂为布尔什维克和孟什维克以后，已是在国内革命运动日益增长的时期。斯大林就站在以列宁为首的布尔什维克方面，巩固党的旧有组织，成立新的组织，积极参加各种辩论会，坚决保卫布尔什维主义立场，揭露孟什维克及其他马克思主义敌人的机会主义思想。一九○四年年底斯大林组织了巴库工人的大罢工。这次罢工就成为南高加索革命运动高涨的开端。
    这时，斯大林还领导了南高加索布尔什维克的秘密刊物“无产阶级的斗争”。他在其上发表了“论党内的意见分歧”、“库泰斯的来信”、“答社会民主党人”、“社会民主党是怎样了解民族问题的”、“无产者阶级和无产者政党”等文，阐述布尔什维主义理论的一些原则和民族纲领。列宁在当时特别称赞“无产阶级的斗争”，称赞它的马克思主义的坚定性，称赞它的极高的文学上的价值。从这些论文中可以看出，这时斯大林已是一个卓越的政论家，已是一个极大的著作家和理论家。
    一九○五年十二月，斯大林代表南高加索各地布尔什维克组织，到塔墨尔福斯（芬兰）出席第一次全俄布尔什维克代表会议。在这次会议上，他与列宁第一见面。一九○六年四月，斯大林参加了党在斯托哥尔姆召开的第四次代表大会，与列宁一起反对了孟什维克，保卫了布尔什维克的革命路线。会后不久，斯大林写了一本“目前时局和工人政党统一代表大会”，总结大会的工作，并论述布尔什维克在革命中所坚持的路线。
    大会后斯大林仍回南高加索工作。当时克鲁泡特金派的无政府主义者在南高加索拼命活动，斯大林就写了一本“无政府主义还是社会主义”小册子，在其中他用通俗易懂的语言解释了何谓唯物论和辩证法，什么是历史唯物论，把马克思主义理论与无产阶级的实际斗争联系起来。
    一九○七年四五月间，斯大林参加了党在伦敦召开的第五次代表大会，会后他写了“俄国社会民主工党伦敦代表大会（一个代表的札记）”一文，在其中他阐述了代表大会的决议，保卫了布尔什维克的思想和立场，揭露了孟什维克在革命中所持的自由资产阶级路线及其对党的取消主义态度，指出孟什维主义实际上是小资产阶级的政治思想。
    被捕五次
    一九○五年俄国第一次革命失败后，至一九一七年二月第二次革命，一共经过了十个年头，这十年是列宁斯大林一生中保存和巩固党，为在新条件下实行布尔什维克路线而坚决奋斗，努力组织和教育工人的诸年，是同沙皇警察作特别坚忍的诸年。从一九○八年三月起到一九一三年，斯大林先后被捕五次，流放五次，同时也从流放地逃走四次。只有最后一次放逐，直到一九一七年一月革命后才获得释放。
    从一九○七年七月起至一九一○年止，斯大林是在巴库活动的。他从参加党的伦敦代表大会回来后，即由党派至南高加索工业和俄国工人运动极重要的中心——巴库去工作。他在这里进行了反对孟什维克和托派的斗争，把巴库变为布尔什维主义的一个堡垒。他领导了布尔什维克的秘密的和公开的刊物——“巴库无产者”、“汽笛”、“巴库工人”。他领导第三届国家杜马（议会）选举运动。一九○八年三月二十五日，斯大林被捕，经过八个月的监禁后，被放逐到沃洛果达省索里维切果茨克镇，期限两年。一九○九年六月二十四日，他又逃回巴库工作。
    一九一○年三月二十三日，斯大林在巴库又被捕，经过半年监禁后，仍放逐至索里维切果茨克镇。他这次从流放地与列宁建立联系，并于一九一○年末写信给列宁，表示拥护列宁把一切主张保存和巩固秘密的无产阶级政党的分子组织成为护党同盟的策略。
    从一九一一年下半年起，开始了斯大林在彼得堡工作时期。是年九月六日，他从放逐地偷跑，到了彼得堡，在这里他与党的组织发生联系，团结和巩固了布尔什维组织，进行了反对取消派、孟什维克和托派的斗争。九月九日，他又被捕，被押三个月后，仍放逐至原放逐地。
    一九一二年一月，在党的普拉加代表会议上，依据列宁的提议，斯大林被缺席选为中央委员，并主持为领导国内全部党的工作而组织的中央俄国局。
    一九一二年二月二十九日，斯大林又从放逐地逃走。在一个很短的时间内，他进行了很多工作：他奉中央的委托巡视了俄国各重要地区；准备了当前的“五一运动”；写了有名的中央“五一”传单；在连拿罢工时期领导了彼得堡的布尔什维克的“明星”周刊。当时依照列宁的指示，由斯大林发起，创办了“真理报”，其第一期于一九一二年五月五日出版。“真理报”的出版，“奠定了布尔什维主义一九一七年胜利的基础”（斯大林在“真理报”十周年纪念时的话）。因此，为了纪念“真理报”的诞生，后来苏联政府就把这一天定为工人出版节。
    一九一二年四月二十二日，斯大林在彼得堡被捕，经过数月的监禁后，被放逐至纳雷姆边疆，期限三年。是年九月一日，斯大林又从放逐地逃回彼得堡，在这里他编辑“明星”周刊和“真理报”，领导布尔什维克在第四届国家杜马选举运动中的活动。
    一九一二——一九一三年，斯大林著了“马克思主义与民族问题”一书。斯大林的这部著作，是布尔什维主义关于民族问题理论和纲领之宣言，在这里他简单明了地说明了民族问题上的两种纲领，两种世界观：第二国际的与列宁主义的。列宁很重视这部著作，当时他写道：“近来在马克思主义理论文献中，……社会民主党民族纲领的基础，已有详细的说明（在这方面首屈一指的是斯大林的论文）”。
    一九一三年二月间，斯大林在彼得堡又被捕，被放逐至西伯利亚东部土鲁罕边疆，期限四年。他在这里度过了一九一四、一九一五、一九一六诸年。
    一九一四年八月帝国主义战争爆发了。第二国际所属的各国社会民主党，都叛变了，只有列宁，只有布尔什维克仍忠于国际主义的旗子。这时，斯大林在放逐中虽与世界、与列宁及与党的中央隔绝，但他在关于战争、和平及革命诸问题上仍信守列宁的国际主义的立场。他在放逐中不倦地进行革命工作，他给列宁写信；他揭发孟什维克和托派；在布尔什维克政治犯大会上痛骂加米涅夫在第四届国家杜马布尔什维克议员受审时的叛节行为。
    一九一六年十二月，斯大林因被动员入伍，被押至亚庆斯克村；次年三月八日，他得知二月革命的消息，就回到彼得堡，在这里他领导布尔什维克党中央和彼得堡市委的活动，并编辑“真理报”。
    在十月革命时期
    在第二次革命——二月革命中，沙皇专制政体被推翻了。但在资产阶级临时政府的统治下，非正义的帝国主义战争仍在继续着，农民未得到土地，工人没有麦包吃。另一方面，在当时的俄国，与资产阶级政府并列，还存在着另一个政权——工农兵苏维埃，这种苏维埃是工人、农民反对沙皇政权的联合组织，同时也就是他们的政权机关——专政机关。这样，在二月革命后，俄国就成为两种政权并存的局面。
    一九一七年四月三日，列宁结束了长期的流亡生活，回到俄国，当天他就发表了有名的“四月提纲”，规定党在新的条件下的新的奋斗方针：把资产阶级革命转变为社会主义革命。同月二十四日，布尔什维克召开第七次代表会议，宣布以列宁的这个提纲作为会议的工作基础。
    斯大林在这次代表会议上坚决拥护列宁的路线，他并且作了关于民族问题的报告，陈述了布尔什维克的民族政策，这种政策就保证了十月社会主义革命中一切被压迫民族对布尔什维克党的拥护。
    一九一七年五月，布尔什维克党中央成立政治局，斯大林当选为政治局委员。从这个时候起，直到今天，斯大林一直是联共中央政治局委员。六月第一次全俄苏维埃代表大会上，斯大林当选为中央执行委员（政府）。
    斯大林一天一天成为领导布尔什维克党全党实际工作的中心人物，他以中央委员资格直接指导彼得格勒市委，领导“真理报”工作，并且常在“真理报”上发表论文。七月列宁因受反革命临时政府的迫害，不得不躲藏起来。斯大林就领导了秘密举行的党的第六次代表大会，在其上作了中央工作总结报告和关于目前形势的报告，给党明确规定了争取社会主义革命的任务、策略及武装起义的方针。
    八月科尔尼洛夫将军叛乱，企图恢复沙皇制度。这一冒险叛乱的溃败就揭开了一个新的革命阶段。斯大林访问了处于秘密状态的列宁两次。两人确信冲击的时期日益迫近，确定加紧准备武装起义。斯大林就直接领导了武装起义的全部准备工作。他常把各地党的组织的代表叫来，给以指示，并定出具体的战斗任务。十月十六日党中央委员会选出党领导武装起义的总部，由斯大林负责主持。这个总部就成了彼得格勒苏维埃革命军事委员会的领导核心，它在实际上领导了全部武装起义。在十月十日和十六日党中央两次会议上，斯大林坚决拥护了列宁武装起义的路线，责斥了季诺维也夫和加米涅夫反对向敌人进攻的叛变行为。
    一九一七年十月二十四日（公历十一月六日），临时政府头子克伦斯基下令封闭布尔什维克党中央机关报“工人之路”。这作了革命的导火线，当日晚革命军队和工人赤卫队在彼得格勒举行起义，次日攻占各火车站、邮政局、电报局、政府阁部、晚上攻下临时政府所躲藏的冬宫，逮捕了临时政府人员。同时这一晚上第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会开幕，宣布把全部政权移交苏维埃，并成立第一届人民委员会（政府），以列宁任主席，这样，伟大的十月社会主义革命就胜利了。
    在苏维埃政府成立后，斯大林任民族事务人民委员，一直到一九二三年为止。他直接领导党和苏维埃政权处理苏联境内民族问题的全部工作。所以，象列宁一样，斯大林是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联）的倡导者和组织者。
    在内战时期
    俄国地主资本家们被十月革命推翻后，就进行反革命，勾结外国资本家来武装干涉本国革命。这样，就揭开了苏联历史上的内战时期。在这一时期，斯大林是革命军队历次重大胜利地直接授意人和组织者。凡当最危急的关头，凡在战场上决定革命胜败的地方，斯大林就在那里出现了。斯大林到了那里，那里就打了胜仗。
    一九一八年春季，国外英法帝国主义者由奥匈被俘官兵组成“捷克斯洛伐克军团”进犯；英军并在北方摩尔曼斯克港登陆；同时国内沙皇军队残余白卫军和社会革命党人在窝尔加河流域二十三个城市作乱响应；而莫斯科城内有左派社会革命党人举行暴动。革命首都已同产粮地区乌克兰和西伯利亚隔断，只有从东南部窝尔加河下游和北高加索取得粮食，而到这些地方去，须经过察利津。只有保持住察利津，才能取得粮食，才能挽救革命。当此危急关头，列宁就派斯大林前去察利津担任粮务总指挥。斯大林到了这里，坚决肃清城内白卫军阴谋分子，取得大批粮食，并主持保卫察利津工作。结果，斯大林保卫住了这个战略要点，粉碎了白军进犯莫斯科的企图。
    一九一八年末，东方战线皮尔姆一带危急万分。沙皇将领高尔恰克部队拼命进攻，急图与从北方进攻的英军汇合。斯大林被派前去挽救局势，在南方——察利津一带，他使顿河区反革命势力未能与乌拉尔一带和窝尔加河沿岸反革命势力汇合；在北方，他使干涉军未能与捷克军和高尔恰克军队汇合，这样，红军一举而击败了那南北两军都与盟军隔绝的高尔恰克。
    一九一九年五月沙皇将领尢登尼赤在芬兰，爱沙尼亚两国军队及英国舰队支持下。向彼得格勒猛攻，企图牵制红军攻击高尔恰克。同时，红军后方克隆斯塔特炮台又有人举行暴动。红军阵线发生动摇，敌人冲到彼得格勒城下。斯大林被派到这里来了，他很快消除慌乱局面，用步兵配合舰队，从海陆双方夹攻，克复两个反叛炮台，歼灭白军，大败尤登尼赤白军。彼得格勒的威胁解除了。
    一九一九年夏季，当东线红军进击高尔恰克的时候，沙皇将领邓尼金占了顿河矿区，向乌克兰大举进犯，波兰白军也出动援助邓尼金，并占了明斯克。敌人从四面八方向首都莫斯科前进。人心惶惶，形势险恶万分。其中最凶恶的敌人是邓尼金。当时列宁号召：“大家都去反对邓尼金！”斯大林到了这个最紧急的南线。他很快整理好队伍，制定作战计划，挑选指挥官和政工人员，并且亲自临阵督战，及时改正错误。这样，红军就根本歼灭了邓尼金白军，扭转了局势。
    一九一九年十一月二十七日，全俄苏维埃中央执行委员会（政府），根据列宁的提议，授予斯大林“红旗勋章”，以表彰他在国内战争各战线上的勋功。
    一九二○年五月，波兰贵族在帝国主义者支持之下，发动对苏联的第三次进攻。斯大林又被派到西南战线去抗击波兰白军。他在这里直接领导红军击溃波兰白军，收复基也辅等地，并且使红军还转为进攻。同年十一月，弗兰格尔白军在帝国主义者支持之下，由克里米亚进犯乌克兰，于是斯大林又主持保卫乌克兰南部抗击弗兰格尔进犯的工作，并拟定了歼灭弗兰格尔白军的计划。结果，后者被歼灭了。至此，十月革命后的革命战争就获得了基本的胜利。
    善于组织党员和工人群众，勇于负责，依靠群众，毫不留情地打破怠工勾当，用铁腕镇压叛徒、奸贼、及间谍在前后方的阴谋，以以身作则的奋勇工作和明确的革命前途提高工农及红军战士地战斗精神和革命热诚，善于识破并根本打破敌人最机巧最险毒的战略计划——这就是斯大林在历次战役中战无不胜的重要原因。
    在恢复时期
    国内战争胜利结束以后，苏联便进入恢复和发展国民经济的时期。为了达到这个目的，列宁提出了新的方针——新经济政策。在这一时期之初，托洛茨基分子及其他反党集团如“工人反对派”、“民主集中派”、“左派共产主义者”等勾结起来，以种种借口，阻挠党的新方针的执行。斯大林就和列宁在一起，捍卫了党的路线，粉碎了这些反党敌人。
    一九二二年四月三日，联共中央全体会议根据列宁的提议，选举斯大林为中央总书记。从这个时候起，斯大林一直担任着这个职务。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联），就是由斯大林在这几年间一手组织成的。起初斯大林进行了大量工作，成立了各个民族的苏维埃共和国，然后于一九二二年十二月三十日在第一次全联盟苏维埃代表大会上，由列宁和他的提议，通过决定，各苏维埃民族按自愿原则在国家关系上联合起来而成为苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联）。
    一九二四年一月二十一日，布尔什维克党的创始人和领袖——列宁，病逝了。斯大林就作了列宁事业的最可靠、最坚强的继续者，布尔什维克党中央的列宁主义者核心和全党便团结在斯大林的周围。在一月二十六日第二次全苏联苏维埃大会追悼列宁的大会上，斯大林宣读了有名的伟大誓词：要保持共产党员这个伟大称号的纯洁性；要保护党的统一；要保护和巩固无产阶级专政；要竭力巩固工农联盟；要巩固和扩大苏联；要巩固红军；要忠实于共产国际的原则。
    一九二四年斯大林发表了“论列宁主义的基础”一著，把列宁主义作了极精彩的说明和深刻的理论上的阐述。这部著作在思想上武装了苏联人民，也武装了全世界劳动人民。
  　在实现工业化时期
    一九二五年十二月，联共举行第十四次代表大会，斯大林在其政治报告中确定全国社会主义工业化是党的总路线。他说：“把我国从农业国变为以自己力量生产必须装备的工业国，这就是我们总路线的本质之所在，是我们总路线之基础。”此后，他就把苏联人民引导到国家工业化和农业集体化的道路。
    从一九二六年起，苏联人民在斯大林领导之下，便踏上全国工业化阶段。斯大林首先规定工业化的实质，并不是随便发展任何工业，而是要发展重工业，首先要发展作为重工业核心的机器制造业，因为只有创立了重工业和本国机器制造业，才能造成社会主义的物质基础，使苏联不依赖于资本主义世界，才能为农业社会主义改造事业建立技术基础。而实行工业化的基本任务，则是提高劳动生产率、减低成本费、加强劳动纪律、厉行节约等。
    这时帝国主义者力谋破坏和设法破坏苏联工业化，如宣布对苏联断绝商务关系（英国），暗杀苏联公使（波兰）等。苏联国内托派、季诺维也夫及以前已被击垮的那些反党集团残余，又联合起来，反对联共的总路线。斯大林领导苏联人民在思想上和组织上都击溃了托、季联盟，他在联共第十五届代表会议上（一九二六年十一月）作了“论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向”的报告；接着在共产国际执委第七次扩大会议上（一九二六年十二月）作了“再论我们党内的社会民主主义的倾向”的报告。这两个报告，就在思想上武装了苏联共产党、苏联人民及共产国际，保证了联共队伍的团结。
    改造旧厂，建造新厂，工业化的每一部门，每个问题，都是由斯大林亲自考虑、制订和解决的。不到两年，到一九二七年十二月，社会主义工业化政策已经获得了显著的成功。在是月联共所召开的第十五次代表大会上，斯大林作了总结报告，确定扩大和巩固社会主义经济命脉，坚持消灭国民经济中资本主义分子的方针。同时，他详述了苏联农业落后于工业的情形，指出对小农经济不实行社会主义改造，则苏联的军队和城市居民就要挨饿，国民经济就不能向前发展，因此他提出了全力开展农业集体化的新任务。
    但是，这时布哈林、李可夫、托姆斯基这些右倾机会主义者，又出来拼命反对党的路线。于是斯大林就领导苏联人民击溃了这些右派。一九二八年十月他在莫斯科省委和监委联席会议上发表了“论联共党内的右倾危险”的演说及一九二九年四月在联共中央全会上又发表了“论联共党内的右倾”的演说。在这两次演说里，他揭穿右倾分子是列宁主义的敌人，是富农在党内的代办。
    在这一时期，斯大林还发表了许多关于中国革命问题的报告或论文，如“论中国革命的前途”（一九二六年十一月）、“中国革命问题”（一九二七年四月）、“与中山大学学生的谈话”（一九二七年五月）、“中国革命与共产国际的任务”（一九二七年五月）、“关于中国”（“时事问题简评”）（一九二七年七月）、“关于中国”（一九二七年八月）等等。在这些报告或论文里边斯大林关于中国革命的性质、动力、任务及其前途作了英明的分析和预言。今日中国革命的伟大胜利，就证明了斯大林这些分析和预言的正确。
  　在实现农业集体化时期
    从一九三○年起，苏联进入农业集体化阶段。一九二八——一九二九年间，大批农民已经加入集体农庄；同时，由于实行全国工业化政策的结果，社会主义工业已可以给农业供给各种机器了。因此，斯大林于一九二九年十二月二十七日在马克思主义土地问题专家会议上发表演说，除揭穿资产阶级所谓国民经济各个部分“平衡”论、反马克思主义的所谓社会主义建设事业“自流”论、以及反马克思主义的所谓小农经济“稳固”论以外，并深刻分析了集体农庄这种社会主义经济形式的本质，提出实行农业全盘集体化，“由限制富农剥削倾向政策进到消灭富农阶级政策”。并且，斯大林从现实出发，确定集体农庄的基本形式是劳动组合；农民加入集体农庄以自愿为原则。
    在农业集体化运动中，个别地区，个别干部犯了偏向；有的违犯了自愿原则，强迫农民加入集体农庄；有的害了急性病，想跳过劳动组合形式，一下来办农业公社，把住宅、小牲畜、家禽等等都强迫化为公有。斯大林前后写了“胜利冲昏头脑”，“答集体农庄工作的同志们”等文，指出了农民问题上这些错误之根源，并加以坚决纠正。一九三三年二月十九日，他在第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上发表演说，号召“把所有集体农庄变成布尔什维克的集体农庄”，“把所有集体农民变成生活丰足的人”。他的这篇演说，深深印入苏联千百万集体农民的心坎，成了集体农庄的实际战斗纲领。
    到一九三四年年底，苏联集体农庄已成为坚强而不可战胜的力量，当时加入的农户已达总数四分之三，耕地面积已达总数百分之九○。“这是一个极深刻的革命，是从社会的旧质态转变到新质态的突变，照其结果来说，它是与一九一七年十月革命具有同等意义的。”（“联共历史”第十一章）
    一九三四年初，斯大林在向联共第十七次代表大会的工作报告中，总结了社会主义的胜利，指出社会主义经济结构在苏联国民经济中已成为独占统治的力量——其他一切经济结构已经没落；并指出集体农庄已经是最终而永远地胜利了。他提出了消灭人们意识中资本主义残余的任务。
  　在完成社会主义建设时期
    从一九三五年至一九四○年，在苏联社会主义建设史上叫做完成社会主义建设时期。
    由于全国工业化和农业集体化的结果，在这一时期之初，苏联国民经济已拥有世界上最先进的技术：工业有了许许多多机器、机床及其他新式生产工具；农业有了本国出产的头等拖拉机、康拜因机及其他各种各样复杂农业机；红军有了新式精良技术装备——大炮、坦克、飞机、军舰；运输业有了头等汽车、机车、轮船及飞机等。这时基本的一环便是需要精通这些技术的人材。“没有精通技术的人材，技术便是死的东西”（斯大林）。因此，斯大林于一九三五年五月在红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上发表演说，提出“干部决定一切”的口号。
    苏联的先进工人们，首先响应了斯大林的这个号召。全国掀起了斯达哈诺夫运动。接着国民经济一切部门都先后出现了数十万劳动英雄和模范工作者。斯大林于一九三五年十一月在第一届全苏联斯达哈诺夫式工作者会议上，作了“关于斯达哈诺夫运动的历史意义及其任务”的报告，指出这一运动的意义，“就在于这一运动能打破不充分的旧的技术标准，并且往往超过了先进资本主义国家的劳动生产率，这样就造成了我国更加巩固社会主义制度，把我国变成最丰足国家的实际条件”；并说，这个运动开辟了走向共产主义的道路。
    一九三六年十一月二十五日，斯大林在第八次全苏联苏维埃非常代表大会上报告了新宪法的草案，说明了苏联自一九二四年通过宪法以来所发生的种种重大变化及新宪法的内容。新宪法记述了苏联社会主义建设的一切成就。
    一九三八年，斯大林著了“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”一书，经联共中央特设委员会审定。这是马克思主义基本知识的一部真正的百科全书。在这本书里，斯大林以其深刻透沏的笔锋，说明和综合了苏联共产党的丰富经验，尤其在“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”一节里，他对辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的基本原则作了绝顶简明、独到的叙述。“这是自有马克思主义以来传播最广的一部马克思主义著作。”（日丹诺夫语）
    一九三九年三月，联共召开第十八次代表大会，斯大林作了工作报告。他在这个报告中，对苏联国际地位作了深刻的分析，揭穿了那些力谋挑起战争和发动反苏武装干涉者的计划，并确定了苏联对外政策的四条原则。同时，他述说了苏联社会主义建设的种种成功，社会主义经济之增长，人民物质文化生活之提高，苏维埃制度之更进一步巩固，并向苏联人民提出了一个新的伟大的历史任务：在最近十年至十五年以内，在经济关系上，即以工业产量平均每口人计算，赶上并超过各主要资本主义国家。在这个报告里，斯大林还向前发展了列宁的社会主义革命理论，具体化了一个国家内可以建成社会主义的学说，得出了一个结论，即使资本主义包围局面仍然存在的条件下苏联仍可能建成共产主义；他还分析了社会主义国家发展的各个阶段，说明了社会主义国家职能因条件变化而变化的情形，得出结论说，如果资本主义包围局面还继续存在下去，则国家在共产主义社会里也还必须保存的。斯大林的这些结论和指示，更加丰富了马列主义，用新的思想武器武装了苏联工人阶级及全世界的工人阶级。
    一九三九年十二月二十日，即当斯大林六十寿辰的时候，苏联最高苏维埃主席团授予斯大林“社会主义劳动英雄”称号；以表彰他在组织布尔什维克党，创立苏维埃国家，建成苏联社会主义社会及巩固苏联各族人民友谊的特殊功绩。
  　在卫国战争时期
    一九四一年六月二十二日，德国希特勒法西斯匪徒背信弃义，进犯苏联。苏联人民抗击德国法西斯匪徒的卫国战争开始了。这一战争要求苏联人民要拿出全部力量，动员全部物质的和精神的资源。因为敌人是强大的，对战争是有很好地准备的，利用了在战争初期突然袭击的一切优点，并且不惜用一切手段以实现其卑劣计划——确立德国主义的世界霸权。
    是年六月三十日，为了抗击敌人，苏联设立国防委员会，以斯大林为主席，把国家全部政权交给该委员会主持。斯大林就统率苏联武装力量，领导苏联人民抗击最凶恶的敌人——德国法西斯主义的战争。七月三日，斯大林发表广播演说，对战争的性质和目的作了深刻的分析，规定苏联人民抗击德国法西斯的战争是卫国的正义的解放性的战争，号召苏联人民奋起保卫祖国。
    十月底敌人进到距莫斯科数十公里的地带了。十一月七日——十月革命节日红场上照旧举行阅兵典礼，斯大林在列宁陵前讲台上号召苏联军人、游击队员，歼灭敌人。十二月间斯大林在莫斯科一带集中了几个军队，突然一举而击溃德军，并乘胜追击逃敌四百余公里。这样，希特勒包围和占领莫斯科的计划就被粉碎了。
    在莫斯科附近击溃德军是苏联抗德战争头一年有决定意义的军事事件，同时也是德军在第二次战争中所受的第一次重大失败，这就打破了德军不可战胜的神话。
    一九四二年七月中旬，德军进攻斯大林格拉，打算顺路占领该城，突破伏尔加河苏联防线，包抄莫斯科。十月五日，斯大林给斯大林格拉前线总指挥下命令说：“要你采取一切办法保卫斯大林格拉。斯大林格拉绝不应交给敌人。”经过数月的苦战，苏军在这里终于歼灭了三十万德军，扭转了战局。从此，就开始了苏军把敌人大批驱逐出境的时期。
    一九四五年五月二日，苏军攻占柏林，八日德军最高指挥部签订了德国无条件投降书。五月九日，斯大林向苏联全国人民发表广播演说，说“我国人民战胜德帝国主义的这一伟大的胜利日子来到了”！
    一九四五年六月二十六日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团代表苏联全国人民的意志，奖给斯大林第二枚“胜利勋章”，以表彰他组织苏联兵力及巧妙领导苏军击败德国法西斯而获得完全胜利的莫大功勋；同时，授予斯大林“苏联英雄”称号及“列宁勋章”和“金星奖章”各一枚，以褒奖他在保卫祖国及首都莫斯科的艰苦时期指挥苏军作战的功劳。
    同年六月二十七日，斯大林荣受苏联大元帅最高军衔。
    同年八月九日苏联对日宣战，苏军陆军部队和太平洋舰队在远东开始了对日军的战斗动作，迅速迫使日寇关东军投降，解放了我国东北及库页岛南部、朝鲜北部、千岛群岛。
    一九四五年九月二日日本政府和军事代表在东京签署无条件投降书，斯大林发表广播演说，宣布：“从今天起，我们可以认为我们祖国摆脱了西方德寇侵略和东方日寇侵略的威胁。全世界各国人民所渴望的和平来临了。”
    一九四六年二月九日，斯大林在莫斯科市斯大林选区选民大会上发表演说，明确地指出了苏联在卫国战争中所获得的伟大胜利，并确定了继续发展社会主义社会力量之巨大纲领。
    由以上可知，斯大林的一生事业，是与列宁的事业，与苏联共产党的历史，与苏联人民建设社会主义的历史密切联系在一起的。
    同时，斯大林的一生事业是与国际工人运动及各殖民地人民民族解放斗争联系在一起的。全世界劳动人民和被压迫民族都奉斯大林为自己的导师，因为他们从斯大林著作中学习如何战胜敌人，学习如何谋求自己民族的解放与社会的解放。
    斯大林作风的特点是：“对社会主义敌人毫不留情；极深刻的原则精神；在工作中既有明确的革命的前途和目的，又有非达到目的不止的坚强意志；贤明而具体的领导；同群众有不可分开的联系。……比谁都更巧于综合群众的革命的创造经验，响应并发挥群众的首创精神，向群众学习并教导群众，引导群众向胜利前进。”（“斯大林传略”）
    斯大林就是全世界劳动人民和被压迫民族的旗子。
