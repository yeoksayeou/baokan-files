　　Malayan Communist Party Singapore Municipal Committee
　　Calls for Unity and Struggle to End British Imperialist Rule
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: Singapore delayed news: The Singapore Municipal Committee of the Malayan Communist Party issued a letter to all Singapore compatriots on November 7th, the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, calling on the Malayan people to unite and launch a struggle to end the rule of British imperialism. The letter to compatriots first pointed out that the victory of the Soviet October Revolution laid the foundation for defending world democracy and peace; the Soviet Union crushed the aggression of German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, liberated millions of oppressed people in Southeast Europe, further weakened the strength of imperialism, and consolidated the foundation for defending world democracy and peace.

    Regarding the Malayan national liberation movement, the letter pointed out: "By this year's October Revolution Day, the Malayan Communist Party has resolutely led the majority of the Malayan people in launching a fierce liberation war against the brutal ruler—British imperialism—to fight for independence for one year and four months. The Malayan national revolutionary war has gradually developed towards a victorious future for more than a year; the Liberation Army has been universally established throughout Malaya, with unified command and strict discipline; people of all ethnic groups in Malaya have been universally organized and united in the struggle. The British imperialists' military attempt to achieve a quick victory has suffered a serious and disastrous defeat under the strong counterattack of the military and civilians throughout Malaya. Today's situation makes us more firmly believe that the Malayan national revolutionary war will surely be victorious, and British imperialism will eventually be defeated.

    However, precisely because of the British imperialists' disastrous military defeat, they are even more frantically and unscrupulously attacking our Malayan compatriots in a desperate struggle. In Singapore, the British imperialists, disregarding the life and death of the people, have increased the people's various burdens, implemented exorbitant taxes and levies and economic monopolies, forcing industrial and commercial businesses to close down; they have implemented layoffs and wage cuts for our worker brothers, adopting shift work systems and extending working hours and other exploitative measures, causing tens of thousands of workers to become unemployed, destitute, sick, and die. They use special agents, intimidation, blacklists, kidnapping, arrests, and other means to undermine the patriotic movement of overseas Chinese students."

    The letter to compatriots finally called on the Malayan people to unite and struggle to end the rule of British imperialism, and specifically put forward the four major tasks of the Malayan people: First, in order to defend the lasting peace of the world, compatriots of all ethnic groups and strata should stand unhesitatingly on the side of the peace fortress—the Soviet Union, unite closely around the Soviet Union, and launch a fierce struggle against aggression, enslavement, oppression, and exploitation against British imperialism. Second, actively promote the non-cooperation movement against British imperialism, do not become British imperialist police, special police, and special agents, do not become executioners and cannon fodder who slaughter their own compatriots, and do not give British imperialism a penny, so that it will be isolated and die. Third, actively promote and support the national liberation army movement, so that it can expel British imperialism from Malaya as soon as possible and protect the lives and property of the people of Malaya. Fourth, universally adopt various methods to concretely study the great spirit and significance of the October Revolution, and humbly learn from its experiences and lessons.

　　马来亚共产党新加坡市委
  　号召团结斗争结束英帝统治
    【新华社北京十七日电】新加坡迟到消息：马来亚共产党新加坡市委会于十一月七日苏联十月革命三十二周年纪念日，发表告全新加坡同胞书，号召马来亚人民团结一致，展开斗争，结束英帝国主义的统治。告同胞书首先指出苏联十月革命的胜利遵奠定了保卫世界民主和平的基础；苏联粉碎了德、意、日法西斯的侵略，解放了东南欧被压迫的千百万人民，进一步削弱了帝国主义的力量，巩固了保卫世界民主和平的基础。
    论及马来亚民族解放运动时，该书指出：“到今年十月革命节时，马来亚共产党坚决领导全马来亚大多数人民与残暴的统治者——英帝国主义展开猛烈的争取独立的解放战争，已有一年四个月了。马来亚民族革命战争一年多来，已逐渐向胜利的前程发展；解放军普遍在全马各地建立了，指挥统一，纪律严明；全马来亚各民族人民在斗争中已普遍组织与团结起来，英帝国主义速战速决的军事企图，在全马军民坚强的反击下遭受到严重的惨败。今天的形势，使我们更坚信马来亚的民族革命战争必然胜利，英帝国主义终于要失败的。
    但是正由于英帝国主义在军事上的惨败，它就更疯狂和不择手段地向我们全马同胞进攻，以作垂死挣扎。在新加坡，英帝国主义不顾人民死活，加重人民各种负担，实施苛捐杂税和经济垄断，迫使工商业倒闭关门；对工人兄弟则实行裁员减薪，采用轮工制与延长工作时间等剥削手段，使成千成万工人失业、流浪、疾病和死亡。对华侨学生则利用特务、恐吓、黑名单、绑票、逮捕等手段，摧残华侨学生的爱国运动。”
    告同胞书最后号召马来亚人民团结一致，为结束英帝国主义统治而奋斗，并具体提出马来亚人民的四大任务：第一，为了保卫世界的持久和平，各民族各阶层同胞应毫无犹豫地站在和平堡垒——苏联一边，紧紧地团结在苏联的周围，猛烈地向英帝国主义展开反侵略、反奴役、反压迫、反剥削的斗争。第二，积极推进对英帝国主义的不合作运动，不当英帝国主义的警察、特警和特务，不做屠杀自己同胞的刽子手和炮灰，不给英帝国主义一分钱，使其孤立死亡。第三，积极推广支持民族解放军运动，使其早日驱逐英帝国主义出马来亚，保卫全马人民的身家财产。第四，普遍采取各种方式，具体研究十月革命的伟大精神与意义，虚心学习其经验教训。
