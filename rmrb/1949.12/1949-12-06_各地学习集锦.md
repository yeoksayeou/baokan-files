　　Learning Highlights from Various Regions
    The Party Committee of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army recently held an enlarged meeting. The meeting emphasized that the reason why work experience could not be well summarized in the past to improve the work to the next level was due to a lack of theoretical cultivation and a lack of ability to analyze and synthesize practical experience. In order to strengthen theoretical study, the conference required that Party committees at all levels must regard leading theoretical study as one of the most important tasks, with Party committees assigning specific personnel to be responsible for it. They should not only provide principled guidance, but also understand the situation at any time, raise questions, bring them to Party committee meetings for discussion, and provide specific guidance in a timely manner, summarize experience, correct deviations, and improve the effectiveness of learning. The conference, in view of the phenomenon that some units did not seriously abide by the learning system in the past two months, decided to strictly enforce learning discipline and emphasized collective learning. Regardless of whether it is self-study or discussion, it must be collective. Without special emergency tasks, no leave is allowed, and those who miss classes must make up for them.

    The propaganda departments directly under the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee recently discovered in a learning inspection that Party members and League members did not play a greater exemplary role in learning. Some Party and League members are sluggish and lack interest in learning. They also echoed the arguments of some non-Party comrades who said, "The Common Program has been discussed by so many people, and we all agree, so there is no need to discuss it again," and failed to guide everyone to study the documents. What is even worse is that some Party and League members are lagging behind non-Party comrades, losing their leading role in learning. These phenomena have been pointed out by the leadership and are being improved.

    The responsible personnel of the Chahar Local Bank's office, in order to help general cadres study political economics and reduce the difficulty for everyone to "gnaw", took turns giving lectures to everyone. At the beginning, due to a lack of sufficient research and preparation, the lectures were very bad and did not help others. Later, they changed their approach and formed a central group of seven comrades with higher theoretical levels to focus on studying how to lecture, discussing each lesson in depth, and understanding its central meaning in order to explain it clearly to everyone. In this way, the effect was much better than before, which greatly helped the listeners and improved everyone's learning enthusiasm.

　　各地学习集锦
    解放军某军党委顷召开扩大会议，大会强调指出，过去不能把工作经验很好的总结起来，使工作提高一步，便是由于缺乏理论修养，缺乏对实际经验的分析与综合的能力。为了加强理论学习，大会要求各级党委必须把领导理论学习当作头等重要任务之一，党委分工，确定专人负责，不但要作原则指导，而且要随时了解情况，提出问题，拿到党委会上讨论，及时进行具体指导，总结经验，纠正偏向，提高学习效果。大会鉴于过去两个月中，某些单位对学习制度有不认真遵守的现象，决严格学习纪律，强调集体学习，不论自修或讨论，都要集体，没有特殊紧急任务，一律不许请假，缺课的一定要补学。

    中共沈阳市委直属各宣传部门，近在检查学习中发现党员、团员没有在学习中起更大的模范作用。有些党、团员疲疲蹋蹋，没有学习兴趣，听了若干非党同志说“共同纲领是经过那么多人讨论的，我们都同意，不必再讨论”的论调，也加以附和，不引导大家去钻研文件。更不好的现象是有的党、团员还落在非党同志的后面，失掉了在学习中的带头作用。这些现象已经由领导上指出，正改进中。

    察地银行办事处的负责人员，为了帮助一般干部学习政治经济学，减少大家“啃不动”的困难，轮流给大家上课。开头，由于缺乏充分的研究和准备，讲的很不好，对别人没有什么帮助。后来改变了办法，由理论水平较高的七个同志，组成中心小组，专门研究怎样讲，对每节课程全作深入的讨论，领会其中心意思，以便明确地向大家讲解。这样一来，效果比前好多了，对听课的人有了大的帮助，提高了大家的学习情绪。
