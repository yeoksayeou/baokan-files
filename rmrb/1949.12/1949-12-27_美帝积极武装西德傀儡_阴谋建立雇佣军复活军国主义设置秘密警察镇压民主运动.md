Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th: The conspiracy of the Western imperialist bloc, led by the United States, to support West Germany, establish a West German mercenary army, and remilitarize Germany has been gradually advancing since the meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers in Paris last month.

　　On the 15th, 17th, and 22nd of last month, the US, British, and French High Commissioners to West Germany held meetings with West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer in Petersberg. On the 24th, a protocol including ten articles was signed in Bonn, specifying some of the decisions made by the three foreign ministers regarding West Germany. According to British Information Services: the protocol stipulates that West Germany will participate in the European Economic Cooperation Bureau, join the Council of Europe as an assisting member, sign bilateral agreements with the United States regarding the acceptance of "aid" from the Economic Cooperation Administration, send observers to the International Authority for the Ruhr, establish consular and commercial relations with foreign countries under the control of the three countries, and stipulates the reduction of the number of German dismantling plans and the relaxation of restrictions on the German shipbuilding industry.

　　On the 8th of this month, the US, British, and French High Commissioners to West Germany held another meeting in Petersberg. According to a TASS report, the United States exerted strong pressure at the meeting and passed a resolution to establish a West German mercenary army, which will build eleven divisions under the name of "police force," with 10,000 people in each division, most of which will appear in the guise of "labor battalions" and "industrial police." The cost of building the army will be advanced by the United States and Britain, and then transferred to the "occupation expenses" borne by the West German people. Adenauer accepted this resolution and promised to fully implement it. The meeting also approved steps to support the West German military industry. In addition to the 45 million West German marks already received, West German arms factories will receive additional funding. During the meeting, Britain and France had fierce disputes with the United States. According to the German News Agency, the British and French commissioners frequently stated that "British and French public opinion on the West German issue has not yet matured" because they feared that the rearmament of West Germany's aggressive forces would lead to West German remilitarization and that the decisions to completely control the Ruhr Management Bureau by the United States would inevitably arouse fierce opposition from the people of the two countries. However, under the pressure of the United States, Britain and France obediently passed the US proposal.

　　Regarding the method of building the army, US Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley have formulated a plan with German Nazi generals Hoth and Guderian and Polish fascist General Anders to summon former Nazi officers and stormtroopers to serve as the backbone of the mercenary army. According to the New York Compass Daily, British Chief of the General Staff General Montgomery recently held secret talks with sixty banking and industrial capitalists on Wall Street in the United States on the issue of arming West Germany. The US and British occupation authorities are now actively engaged in improving all of West Germany as an air base. According to TASS quoting the Berlin "Daily Review," seventy of Hitler's former 120 airfields are already in use, and airports are also being rebuilt or expanded in Frankfurt, Munich, and Stuttgart in the US-occupied zone, and Dusseldorf and Hanover in the British-occupied zone. The cost of construction is borne by the Bonn "government." Former Nazi air force personnel are actively preparing to build an air force in Nuremberg, Hamburg, and other places under the protection of the US and British authorities.

　　In order to ensure the implementation of these conspiracies, US imperialism instructed Adenauer at the Petersberg meeting to establish a "security organization" to suppress the West German democratic movement, and is actively planning to rebuild the secret police to assist the US military command's intelligence department in carrying out espionage work. According to the German News Agency, the person ordered to establish the secret police is Diels, an organizer of the former Nazi Gestapo, who has actively recruited personnel to carry out activities. At the same time, North Rhine-Westphalia Interior Minister Menzel frankly admitted that the state will allocate 500,000 marks from the budget next year to first establish a secret police.

    【新华社北京二十六日电】以美国为首的西方帝国主义集团扶植西德、建立西德雇佣军队，使德国重新军国主义化的阴谋计划，自上月美、英、法三国外长在巴黎举行会议之后，已在逐步推进中。
    上月十五、十七、二十二日，美、英、法驻西德高级专员在彼得堡与西德傀儡总理阿登纳举行会议。二十四日在波恩签订了包括十项条文的议定书，把三外长会议对西德的一部分决定，加以具体化。据英国新闻处消息：议定书内容规定西德参加欧洲经济合作局，参加欧洲委员会为襄助会员，与美国签订关于接受经济合作总署“援助”的双边协定，派遣观察员参加鲁尔国际管制局，在三国控制下与外国建立领事与商务关系，并规定了削减德国拆卸计划的数量，放宽德国造船业限制等项。
    本月八日，美、英、法驻西德高级专员再度在彼得斯堡举行会议，据塔斯社电通社报道，会上美国施用强大压力，通过建立西德雇佣军队的决议，将用“警察部队”的名义建军十一个师，每师一万人，大部分以“劳动大队”和“工业警察”的面貌出现。建军费用先由美英两国垫付，然后转为“占领开支”由西德人民承担。阿登纳接受了这个决议，并答应彻底予以实现。会议又通过扶植西德军事工业的步骤，西德军火工厂除业已领到的四千五百万西德马克外，将再获得额外资助。在会议中英、法两国曾与美国发生激烈的争吵。据德意志通讯社称：英、法专员因为恐惧重新武装西德侵略势力使西军国主义化，并完全由美国控制鲁尔管制局这些决定，必然引起两国人民的猛烈反对，所以频频表示“英法舆论对西德问题尚未成熟”。但慑于美国的压力，英法两国还是驯服地通过了美国的建议。
    关于建军方法，美国国防部长詹逊和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷，已与德国纳粹将军霍德尔和古德林以及波兰法西斯将军安德斯拟定计划，召集德国前纳粹军官和冲锋队员，担任雇佣军的骨干。另据纽约指南针日报消息：英国参谋总长蒙哥马利将军最近曾就武装西德问题在美国与华尔街的六十个银行和工业资本家举行了秘密会谈。美英占领军当局刻已积极从事改进全部西德为空军基地。据塔斯社引柏林“每日评论报”消息：前希特勒的一百二十个空军机场，已有七十个在使用中，另外还在美占区的法兰克福、慕尼黑、斯备加特，英占区的杜塞尔多夫、汉诺威等地，改建或增辟机场，建筑费用统由波恩“政府”担负。前纳粹空军人员业已在美英当局保护下，在纽伦堡、汉堡等地积极筹建空军。
    美帝国主义为保证这些阴谋计划的实行，曾在彼得斯堡会议上责成阿登纳建立“治安机构”，以镇压西德民主运动，并积极筹划重建秘密警察以协助美军司令部情报处进行特务工作。据德意志通讯社揭露：受命建立秘密警察的人，就是前纳粹盖斯塔波的一个组织者狄尔斯，他已积极召募人员展开活动。与此同时，北莱茵——威斯特伐利亚州内长孟塞尔直率承认明年该州将从预算中拨出五十万马克首先建立秘密警察。
