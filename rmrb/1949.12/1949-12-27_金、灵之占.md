I. The Great March

As the triumphant news arrived that fraternal troops from Gansu and Qinghai had, with extraordinary heroism and tenacity, crossed snowy mountains and sandy deserts, heading for the Xinjiang border, we marched north from Guyuan on the Gansu-Ningxia border toward Ningxia, in a spirit of excitement and competition, amidst continuous rain and muddy roads. It rained all day, and the soldiers had very few raincoats, so they had to use straw hats, towels, dry clothes, etc., to try to protect their ammunition and rations. When someone slipped and fell, comrades helped him up and laughed heartily; or they sang loudly, letting the rainwater mix with sweat and mud, inadvertently flowing into their mouths. Passing through villages, villagers poked their heads out of their doorways, looking at us in surprise and saying, "It's raining so hard, and the road is so difficult to walk, comrades must be very tired!" The reply was always, "In order to liberate Ningxia and eliminate the Ma bandit Hongkui as soon as possible, a little hardship is nothing!"

The road was not only muddy and difficult to walk, but also became more and more desolate. For tens of miles, no people were seen, and no crops were grown. Some people said, "This is comparable to the Red Army's Long March."

During the eight-hundred-mile march, most of the campsites were "open-air campsites." The cooks set up marching pots in the wild, and people poured the grain from their rice bags into the pots. Some people said, "The higher-ups really estimated it carefully. If it weren't for the eight days' worth of food, we would really be drinking the northwest wind these days." A small group leader of the Party said, "When you were filling the rice bags before departure, why did you say that you were treating people like mules? Now you should understand the benefits of preparing your own food, trusting the higher-ups, and not complaining, right?" That person quickly blushed and explained, "I had a stomach ache for two days at the time, and I was really worried about carrying a dozen pounds of millet, but I didn't expect that it would all be used to help my comrades along the way."

Tongxin City was originally stationed with a Ma bandit cavalry regiment, which fled before our army arrived; we only ate one meal, and traveled more than 130 miles to Zhongning. The enemy's Eighty-first Army also retreated to the west of the river. In order to capture and intercept the fleeing enemy, we set off from Zhongning after the weather cleared slightly, detouring through Gunquan, and coordinated with fraternal troops advancing from Qingtongxia to jointly attack Jinji. On September 19th, from Hezhongbao Houjiawan, we walked more than 140 miles of uninhabited plateau, without water or firewood. People only opened their parched throats during the midday rest, barely swallowing the dry rations, and then excitedly continued to move forward. Two cavalry regiments of Ma bandits were still active on our right side all day long, constantly harassing our army's advance. We sent small units to lure them away, while the main force continued to advance.

Later, in the Jinji, Wuzhongbao, and Lingwu areas, the Ma bandits breached the dikes and released water, and canals and paddy fields were connected into one piece, putting us in a difficult situation of marching and fighting in knee-deep mud and waist-deep water. Some people quipped, "This place is really strange. When you need water, it's hard to find a drop, but when you don't need it, water is everywhere."

II. The Pursuit and Annihilation Battle

On the evening of the 19th, we reached the Houjiawan line in the southeast of Jinji. Nearby paddy fields and depressions were almost a swamp. Because I was not familiar with the terrain or the enemy situation, I confronted the enemy across the Han Canal for a night. At dawn, a certain regiment on my left wing was ordered to capture Xujiawan and annihilate the defending enemy. The Ninth Company first successively captured three strongholds including Xujiawan, adopting tactics such as rapid insertion and division, severing the enemy's waist, encircling and breaking through, and vigorously pursuing. They crossed canals and paddy fields, climbing up immediately after falling, and chasing barefoot after their shoes were trapped in the mud. They fought all the way to Majiaqiao, three miles from the city, annihilating an enemy battalion headquarters and another company, capturing more than a hundred people alive. The Third Company and other units of the regiment also rushed to the edge of Jinji City at the same time, and the remnants of the enemy fled into the city. The third squad of the company, with only seven people, due to timely and rapid pursuit, seizing the opportunity, shouted to the enemy on the front line, defeating an enemy company and capturing more than 40 people alive. A certain regiment on my right wing also attacked the Tianjiaqiao line under unfavorable terrain. Because there was no time to build a bridge, the brave men jumped into the canal one after another, with water reaching their necks, only revealing their heads; but they still advanced under the cover of superior firepower, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

At noon, the main force of Ma bandits' 356th Division shrank inside the city. I had cleared the outer perimeter of Jinji in the southeast and was about to deploy for an attack on the city. However, in order to more effectively cut off the escape route and completely annihilate the defenders, my unit was ordered to hand over the task of encirclement and attack to the fraternal army on the left flank, and detoured through Liaojiaqiao and Yangma Lake, heading straight for Wuzhongbao. En route, we joined forces with fraternal troops on the right flank, and attacked and advanced separately.

The main force of Ma bandits' Third Security Division attempted to rely on the Qinghui Canal, more than ten feet wide and deep, south of Wuzhongbao, to deploy defenses along the Beiyi Canal line, and dispersed and defended fortresses in depth in the area south and east of Wuzhongbao. My vanguard troops reached the Luhe Bridge on the evening of the 20th. At dawn on the 21st, the third company of the regiment was ordered to build a bridge. Under the fire of an enemy high bunker and four pillboxes, they were brave and tenacious, making repeated efforts. Soldiers Kuang Guocheng and Li Chongmin persisted in fighting despite being wounded three times, and soldier Zhang Zhenyuan only crawled down to rest in hiding after being seriously wounded for the fourth time. In this way, they finally overcame difficulties and dangers to build the bridge, and occupied the bridgehead on the opposite bank, covering the main force to cross the river and advance.

After that, I vigorously inserted into the outer perimeter of Wuzhongbao, ignoring the flanking attacks of a few enemy bunkers, and attacked the enemy's heart and abdomen. Close combination and flexible application of frontal attacks and flank detours, military strikes and political offensives, bravery and technology, tenacity and resourcefulness, the soldiers, with their own meritorious plans, overcame all hardships and fatigue. After several hours of fierce fighting, the entire enemy defense line was destroyed, and the entire depth was disrupted. For example, the Seventh Company of my regiment, due to good coordination between infantry and artillery and mutual assistance on the battlefield, especially the combination of firepower blasting and assaults, captured four fortresses in a row, annihilating an enemy regimental headquarters and another battalion, capturing more than 170 people alive, and seizing 14 machine guns and more than 450 rifles, while the company itself suffered no casualties. At noon, a certain regiment on my left wing had won consecutive battles and was unstoppable, first capturing Wuzhongbao, known as the Little Tianjin of Ningxia. After the First Company of the regiment entered the urban area, the Seventh Company quickly inserted into the northeast corner to block the fleeing enemy, capturing more than 70 people alive, while they themselves suffered no casualties. At the same time, fraternal troops on the right flank also advanced at full speed in the area east of Wuzhongbao, capturing and annihilating many enemies. At this point, the main force of the enemy's Third Security Division, along with a part of the 256th Division from Lingwu, was either led west across the river by Lu Zhongliang, the commander of the enemy's 128th Army, or fled north in panic when I approached Wuzhongbao. Most of them were annihilated, and the number of those captured alive reached thousands.

Then, I left a battalion stationed in Wuzhongbao to search for the remnants of the enemy, monitor Jinji, maintain order, and keep assets safe. The main force relentlessly pursued Lingwu. When approaching more than ten miles south of the city, the deputy commander of the enemy's 256th Division, etc., came to sue for peace. I ordered them to withdraw the troops from the suburbs to gather inside the city, awaiting reorganization. And, on the one hand, notified all departments to stop shooting at the enemy troops retreating into the city, on the other hand, to prevent the enemy from cheating, that is, with a regiment advanced to the southeast of the city, a regiment advanced to the west of the city, and another regiment from the west of the city around to the north of the city, respectively surrounded and monitored the enemy. As expected, when I arrived at the city, the main force of the enemy's 256th Division and the enemy who fled north from Wuzhongbao had already fled across the river in part. The remaining troops inside the city, including one regiment, another two battalions, and the remnants of the 128th Army headquarters and the 256th Division headquarters, were also beginning to collapse or hide. The division commander, deputy division commander, etc., were all fleeing. The troops that I detoured to the north of the city immediately blocked a part. Later, a small part was sent directly to Rencun Ferry, more than twenty miles northwest of the city, and also intercepted eight cars and some materials, capturing a total of more than 800 enemies. It is worth mentioning that the regiment, from dawn on the 20th to midnight on the 21st, except for a rest of two or three hours south of Wuzhongbao, has been fighting and chasing, many units only ate one meal, many communication personnel did not eat at all, and still insisted on completing the task. When I arrived at a certain regiment west of the city, also because of the everywhere was flooded, there was only water plants and no houses, in order to surely complete the task, endured hunger and cold in the water for half a night; in the morning, everyone was wet, face full of mud, the soldiers were joking with each other.

　　金、灵之占
    罗立斌　
    本文作者罗立斌同志，是人民解放军一九二师副政委，这篇通讯是他亲身参加解放宁夏金积、灵武战役的经过。时间虽已稍迟，但对我们了解解放军是怎样英勇、坚苦的解放大西北，是有帮助的。
    ——编者
    一、大进军
    当甘青兄弟部队以超人的英勇和坚毅，越过雪山沙原指向新疆边境的捷报传来后，我们怀着兴奋与竞赛的心情，在连绵阴雨满路泥泞中，从甘宁边境的固原北向宁夏进军。雨整天在下着，战士们很少雨衣，只好用草帽、手巾、干衣服等，设法保护着弹药和干粮。有人滑倒了，同志们一面扶他起来，一面哈哈大笑；或者便高声地唱着歌，让雨水和着汗泥，不经意地流进嘴里。路过村落，一个个老乡从家门口探头出来，惊奇地看着我们说：“下这么大雨，路又这样难走，同志们真辛苦啊！”回答总是：“我们为了早日解放宁夏，消灭马匪鸿逵，吃点苦不算什么！”
    道路不但泥滑难走，而且愈走愈荒凉，经过几十里地不见人家，可也不长庄稼。有人说：“这可比上红军的二万千里了。”
    八百里进军中，宿营地多半是“露营地”，伙夫在野地里支起行军锅，人们把米袋的粮食倒在锅里。有人说：“到底是上级估计得周到，要不是措足八天的粮食来，这几天真要喝西北风了。”一个党的小组长说：“出发前灌米袋的时候，你为什么讲拿着人当毛驴使呢？这会该懂得自己措自己吃的好处，相信上级，不说怪话了吧？”那一个人连忙红着脸解释：“我当时闹了两天肚子，看着十几斤小米真有点发愁，却没想到一路上都给同志们互助去了。”
    同心城原驻马匪一个骑兵团，在我军到来之前使逃窜了；我们只吃一顿饭，走了百三十多里赶到中宁，敌八十一军也退到河西了。为了抓住截击逃敌，我们在天稍放晴后，就从中宁出发，绕道滚泉，配合从青铜峡进军的兄弟部队，会攻金积。九月十九日，从何忠堡侯家湾，我们走过百四十余里渺无人迹的高原，没有水更没有柴火，人们只在中午休息的时候，张开冒火的嗓子，勉强将干粮咽下肚里，又兴奋是继续前进。马匪两个骑兵团，整天还在我们右侧活动，不时袭扰我军前进的道路。我们一面派小部队去骗逐它们，主力依然继续前进。
    以后，在金积、吴中堡、灵武地区，由于马匪决堤放水，到处河渠纵横，稻田湖沼连成一片，我们行军，作战，经常处于泥泞陷膝水深及腹的困境中。有的人俏皮的说：“这个地方真怪，需要水的时候，一滴也难找，不需要时却又遍地是水。”
    二、追歼战
    十九日黄昏，我们进抵金积东南侯家湾一线。附近稻田凹地，几成泽国，我因地形敌情都不太熟悉，隔着汉渠与敌对峙一夜。拂晓，我左翼某团奉命攻占徐家湾，歼灭守敌。九连首先连续攻占徐家湾等三个据点，采取猛插分割，腰斩逃敌，包团突破，大力追击等手段，穿越水渠稻田，跌倒的马上爬起来，鞋子陷在泥里的便光着脚追，一直打到距城三里的马家桥，歼敌一个营部另一个连，生俘百余人。该团三连等部亦同时直扑金积城边，残敌纷纷溃逃城内，该连三班仅七个人，由于猛追猛插不失时机，火线喊话抓住火候，击溃敌一个连，生俘四十余人。我右翼某团在不利地形下，亦攻抵田家桥一线。因为来不及架桥，勇士们纷纷跳下渠里，水深及颈，只露出一个脑袋来；但依然在优势火力掩护下，节节前进予敌人以重大杀伤。
    中午，马匪三五六师主力龟缩城内，我已扫清金积东南外围，正拟部署攻城。但为更有效的切断逃路全歼守敌，我部又奉命将包围攻击任务交给左路友军，绕道料家桥、养马湖，直插吴中堡。中途与右路友军会合，分头攻击前进。
    马匪保三师主力，企图凭恃吴中堡南深宽各丈余之清水沟，在北一沟线布防，并在吴中堡以南以东地区，纵深分散，固守堡寨。我先头部队二十日黄昏进抵洛河桥，二十一日拂晓，该团三连奉命架桥，在一座高碉四个地堡的敌火射击下，英勇顽强再接再厉。战士匡国成和李崇民，三次负伤仍然坚持战斗，战士张振远，在第四次负重伤后，才自己爬了下来，隐敝休息。就这样，他们终于战胜困难艰险将桥架成，并占领对岸桥头堡垒，掩护主力源源渡河开进。
    其后，我分路猛插吴中堡外围守敌，不顾少数敌堡侧击，直捣敌队心腹。正面攻击与侧后迂回，军事打击与政治攻势，勇敢与技术，顽强与机智，密切结合并灵活运用，战士们怀着自己的立功计划，战胜一切艰苦疲劳，激战数小时，终将守敌防线全部摧毁，纵深整个打乱。例如：我某团七连，由于步炮协同与战场互助，尤其是火力爆战与突击结合得好，连克四个堡寨，歼敌一个团部另一个营，生俘百七十余人，缴机枪十四挺，步枪四百五十余支，而该连自己却无一伤亡。中午，我左翼某团已连战连捷，势如破竹，首先攻占这个号称宁夏小天津的吴忠堡。该团一连攻入市区后，七连迅速地插至东北角堵截逃敌，生俘七十余人，而自己亦无一伤亡。同时，右路友军，亦在吴忠堡以东地区，兼程进击，俘歼甚众。至此敌保三师主力连同灵武来援之二五六师一部，除少数由敌一二八军军长卢忠良率领，早已渡河西窜，另一部在我进逼吴忠堡时狼狈北逃外，大部就歼，为我生俘者，即达千人。
    接着，我留一个营住于吴忠堡，搜巢残敌，监视金积，维护秩序，保管资财，主力又毫不停息地向灵武猛追。进至城南十余里处，敌二五六师副师长等，前来求和，我方令其将城郊部队撤至城内集结，听候改编。并一面通告各部，停止对后撤城内敌军的射击，另方面防敌有诈，即以一上团进至城东南，一个团进至城西，另一个团从城西绕至城北，分别包围监视敌人。不出所料，当我进抵城厢时，敌二五六师主力及吴中堡北窜之敌，已有一部北逃渡河，城内中余一个团另两个营及一二八军军部二五六师师部等残部，也在开始溃散或潜匿，师长副师长等均在逃。我绕至城北部队，当即堵截一部，其后又派出小部，直插城西北二十余里之仁存渡，又截获汽车八辆，物资一部，共俘敌八百余人。值得提出的是该团自二十日拂晓至二十一日午夜，除在吴中堡以南休息了两三小时外，一直在边打边追中，不少单位只吃了一顿饭，许多通讯人员根本没吃上饭，依然坚持着完成任务。我进抵城西某团，亦因遍地汪洋，只有水草没有房子，为了确切地完成任务，忍着饥寒在水里泡了半夜；天明后，个个混身湿透，满脸泥泞，战士们互相着开着玩笑。
