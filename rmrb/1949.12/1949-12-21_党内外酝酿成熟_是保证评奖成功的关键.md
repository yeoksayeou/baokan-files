Thorough Deliberation Inside and Outside the Party is Key to Ensuring Successful Awarding

The Party's awarding work revolves around the current central task, namely the production movement. The general practice is for the branch to award prizes first, followed by the county and district committees holding awarding conferences. Within the branch, the first step is to hold branch committee meetings and general membership meetings to mobilize, and then hold group meetings and general membership meetings, using criticism and self-criticism to compare strengths and weaknesses, and formally conduct the awarding. The awarding is personally led by the county and district Party committees, and non-Party masses are also invited to participate. The criteria for awarding are stipulated by the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee, namely: (1) good production labor and leadership in production; (2) loyalty to the Party and good implementation of resolutions; (3) good connection with the masses; (4) progress in learning and good self-criticism. These four criteria are also called the "Four Comparisons": Compare labor, compare work, compare style, compare learning. To facilitate gaining experience, each county starts with village branches that have a relatively good work foundation and backbone Party members, and then gradually unfolds in a planned manner. Each level of awarding conference invites a considerable number of non-Party mass representatives to participate, listens to the opinions of the people about the Party members, and opens up the Party organization and Party members through the Party's awarding movement, so that the Party organization and Party members can carry out work under the direct supervision of the people in the future. Thorough deliberation and mobilization in the branch, among Party members, and among non-Party masses before the awarding is the most important key to the development of the movement. In the mobilization work, in addition to explaining the conditions for awarding, it is explained that the main significance of the awarding is to improve work so that the Party can better serve the people. Yanggao County once explained to Party members and activists among non-Party masses how to be a good Party member, which was very effective. The deliberation stage is generally longer than the awarding time. Successful experiences have shown that thorough deliberation is equivalent to completing half of the awarding task.

The first significant gain from the awarding is that the enthusiasm of Party members has greatly increased, and the work of the branch has been significantly improved. Among the 655 branches in Yanbei that have undergone the awarding, 485 branches have made great progress. The secretary of the Ximaying Village branch in Yanggao, after participating in the district's awarding conference, resolved to change his past tired work style and actively lead production. The people also have more trust in the Communist Party. The second gain is the discovery of a large number of leading backbones. A total of 935 model Party members and 219 model branches were selected in the 20 counties of the province that underwent the awarding. These model Party members and branches can become a powerful pillar for the Party to carry out work in the future. The third gain is the organizational rectification of the Party, and the purging of counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated the Party. For example, the Zhenmenbao branch in Yanggao Town discovered a Yiguandao leader who had infiltrated the Party during the awarding and expelled him from the Party.

The CCP Chahar Provincial Committee believes in summarizing this movement: Awarding is a good leadership method, which can be applied not only to rural areas, but also to factories, agencies and other departments, but it is necessary to prevent some formalistic and simple methods of "selecting" models, and make the awarding work revolve around the central task. The awarding itself is a mass criticism and self-criticism movement. Rewarding models is to establish a good working method, and it does not mean that shortcomings can not be criticized, or that those who have made mistakes should not be punished.

The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau pointed out in a notice on the awarding movement in Chahar Province: The new heroism movement of awarding prizes and carrying out revolutionary competition is a very good working method in Party building. However, attention should also be paid to exposing certain mistakes and shortcomings within the Party and correctly enforcing discipline at the same time. The notice also pointed out: After the awarding, work should be arranged immediately (such as leading production, collecting grain, issuing land certificates, and running winter schools), and the branch should discuss how to complete it. For the elected branches and Party members, they should be called upon to work hard in production and work hard; for the branches and Party members who have not been selected, they should be called upon to work hard to make progress, overcome shortcomings, and learn from the models. The enthusiasm of the awarding movement should be maintained, and a regular revolutionary competition should be formed within the Party, instead of just doing it once and being done with it.

### 党内外酝酿成熟　是保证评奖成功的关键

　　党内外酝酿成熟
    是保证评奖成功的关键
    党的评奖工作是围绕着当前的中心工作即生产运动进行的，一般的作法是先由支部评奖，后由县、区委员会召开评奖大会。在支部里首先是举行支部委员会和党员大会进行动员，然后召开小组会和党员大会，以批评与自我批评的方法，比较优点缺点，正式进行评奖。评奖时有县、区党委亲自领导，并吸收非党群众参加。评奖的标准系由中共察哈尔省委会所规定，即：（一）生产劳动和领导生产好；（二）对党忠实，执行决议好；（三）联系群众好；（四）学习进步，自我批评好。这四个标准也叫做四比：比劳动、比工作、比作风、比学习。为了便于取得经验，各县均从工作基础比较好和拥有骨干党员的村庄支部入手，随后逐步有计划地展开。各级评奖会议都邀请相当数量的非党群众代表参加，听取人民群众对于党员的意见，并经过党的评奖运动公开党的组织和党员，使党的组织和党员今后能够在人民群众的直接监督下进行工作。评奖前，在支部和党员和非党群众中的充分酝酿和动员，是运动开展的最重要的关键。在动员工作中，除讲解评奖的条件外，并说明进行评奖的主要意义在于改进工作，使党能更好地为人民服务。阳高县曾给党员和非党群众中的积极分子讲解怎样做一个好党员，收效很大。酝酿阶段一般均较评奖时间还长。成功的经验都说明酝酿成熟就等于评奖的任务完成了一半。
    评奖的第一个显著收获是党员的积极性大大提高，支部工作有了显著的改进。雁北经过评奖的六百五十五个支部中，有四百八十五个支部有很大进步。阳高西马营村支部书记，在参加了区的评奖会后，决心转变过去的疲场作风，积极领导生产。人民群众对于共产党也更加信赖了。第二个收获是发现了大批领导骨干，全省二十县经过评奖共评出模范党员九百三十五个，模范支部二百一十九个，这些模范党员、支部可以成为党在今后进行工作的有力支柱。第三个收获是从组织上整顿了党，清洗了混入党的反革命分子。例如阳高镇门堡支部在评奖中发现了一个混入党的一贯道头子，并且把他驱逐出党。
    中共察哈尔省委在总结这一运动时认为：评奖是一种好的领导方法，不仅可以适用于农村，而且可将这一运动推广到工厂、机关等各种部门中去，但必须注意防止某些形式主义的单纯“选”模范的作法，并使评奖工作围绕中心工作进行。评奖本身是一个群众性的批评与自我批评运动。奖励模范是为了树立一种好的工作方法，并不等于就可以不去批评缺点，不等于犯了错误的该处分就不去处分。
    中共中央华北局在关于察省评奖运动的通报中特别指出：评奖及开展革命竞赛的新英雄主义运动、是党的建设中的很好的工作方法。但对于揭发党内某些错误和缺点，正确地执行纪律，也应该同时注意。通报中又指出：评奖以后，应该立即布置工作（如领导生产、征粮、发土地证，办冬学等工作），让支部讨论如何完成。对获选支部和党员，应该号召他们努力生产，努力工作；对落选的支部和党员，应该号召他们努力进步，克服缺点，向模范看齐。要把评奖运动的热情保持下来，在党内形成一种经常性的革命竞赛，不要搞一下就完事大吉。
