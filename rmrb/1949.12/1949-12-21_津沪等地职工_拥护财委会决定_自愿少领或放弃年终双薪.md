　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th: After the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee announced the "Measures for Handling the Original Year-End Double Pay or Bonus Issues in Certain Public Enterprises," workers in Tianjin, Changsha, Shanghai, and other places expressed their warm support. Workers in units such as the Tianjin Municipal Ice Making Factory and Chemical Factory are actively engaged in discussions. Workers at the Public Transportation Management Office decided to comply with the government's stipulated measures and accept reduced year-end double pay. Workers at the No. 6 Textile Factory unanimously agreed during discussions that: workers are the leading class and should consider the interests of all the people and help the country overcome difficulties. Zhu Lianru, chairman of the New Port Engineering Bureau's trade union, said: Since the implementation of the system of paying wages in kind on time after liberation, the lives of New Port workers have been guaranteed. We should respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and resolutely help the government overcome difficulties. Zou Jianchu, Luo Ziyu, and more than fifty other workers at the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau wrote a joint letter to the trade union saying: We know that our government is facing financial difficulties, and in order to support our own government, we are willing to waive the original provisions for year-end bonuses and double pay. More than three hundred workers at the Changsha Postal Administration who are attending training courses unanimously decided after discussion to waive year-end double pay and wrote a letter challenging the more than six hundred workers in the entire bureau. When discussing this issue, workers at the Changsha Maintenance Factory of the Hunan Highway Bureau, in light of the highway's own revenue and expenditure difficulties, also decided not to receive the original year-end double pay. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee called on all workers in Shanghai's public enterprises to unanimously support the regulations of the Central People's Government and the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In its call, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee said: The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee believes that this regulation was made by the Central People's Government based on the national situation, and this is the first call directly issued to workers across the country since the establishment of the Central People's Government. As the leading class of the state power, we should sincerely and resolutely implement this decision of our government.

    拥护财委会决定
    自愿少领或放弃年终双薪
    【新华社北京二十日电】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会“关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法”公布后，天津、长沙、上海等地职工纷纷表示热烈拥护。天津市营制冰厂、化学厂等单位职工正热烈展开讨论。公共汽车管理处职工决定遵照政府规定的办法，少领年终双薪。中纺六厂职工在讨论中一致认为：工人是领导阶级，应当顾及全体人民的利益，帮助国家克服困难。新港工程局工会主任朱连如说：新港职工在解放后由于实行了按期发放实物的工资制度，生活已有保障。我们应该响应全国总工会的号召，坚决帮助政府渡过困难。长沙电讯局工友邹建初、罗子裕等五十多人在共同写给工会的信中说：我们知道我们的政府在财政上正处在困难中，为了拥护我们自己的政府，我们愿意放弃年终奖金及双薪的原有规定。长沙邮政管理局正在参加训练班的三百多个职工在讨论后一致决定放弃年终双薪，并写信向全局六百余职工挑战。湖南公路局长沙保养厂职工在讨论这一问题时，联系了公路本身的收支困难情形，也决定不领原有的年终双薪。上海市总工会筹委会号召上海市公营企业全体工人一致拥护中央人民政府的规定和中华全国总工会的号召。上海总工会筹委会在号召中说：上海总工会筹委会认为此次规定是中央人民政府根据全国情况而作的，这是中央人民政府成立以后对全国工人直接发出的第一个号召。作为国家政权的领导阶级，对于自己政府的这一决定应是竭诚地坚决地加以执行。
