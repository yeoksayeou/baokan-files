　　Tianjin Industrial Exhibition Concludes Successfully
  　Industry and Commerce Clarify Development Direction
    Facing the Countryside to Meet Farmers' Urgent Needs
    [This newspaper Tianjin dispatch] Reporter Gu Weijin reports: The Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, which began on November 4th and lasted for a month, closed on December 5th, achieving significant gains. The most important of these, such as the issues of Tianjin industry and commerce facing the countryside and strengthening urban-rural material exchange, have been preliminarily resolved.
    1. This industrial exhibition clearly pointed out that industry and commerce facing the countryside has broad development prospects. Since the liberation of Tianjin, many people in the industrial and commercial sectors have held a skeptical attitude towards facing the countryside: Can the countryside supply raw materials? Do farmers have purchasing power? The industrial exhibition has provided a definite answer. According to detailed introductions by farmer representatives from four provinces (Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Chahar), the vast rural areas of North China contain abundant industrial raw materials, such as wool from places like Chahar Province, cotton and peanuts from the Pingyuan area, coal and iron from Shangdang, and mirabilite and oil from various places, all of which can be supplied in large quantities for industrial needs, which can get rid of the raw material dependence on foreign imperialism. This first of all dispelled their concerns about whether the countryside could supply raw materials. Regarding the issue of farmers' purchasing power, according to incomplete statistics, farmer representatives ordered and purchased over 10,000 waterwheels, 1,300 grass bag weaving machines, 18,000 grass bags, 180 scales, 12 sets of silk and steel roller mills, 11 sets of Type C steel mills, and over 10 free-style continuous oil presses. Other items such as various new-style farm implements, insecticides, fertilizer powder, universal pulverizers, hand-operated noodle cutters, screw plates, tap drills, Yunfeng incubators, bacteria incubators, fine and coarse grinding wheels, dry plates, bellows, lampblack, mica machines, specific gravity meters, lead wire, colors, matches, colored cloth, and printed cloth were also ordered in considerable quantities.

　　天津工展胜利闭幕
  　工商业明确发展方向
    面向农村满足农民迫切需要
    【本报天津专讯】记者古维进报导：天津工业展览会，从上月四日开始，举行一月，已于本月五日闭幕，获重大收获。其中最主要者如天津工商业面向农村问题和加强城乡物资交流问题，均得到初步解决。
    一、这次工展明确的指出了工商业面向农村具有宽广的发展前途。天津解放以来，许多工商业界人士对于面向农村抱着怀疑态度：农村能否供给原料？农民是否有购买力？经过工展已得到确切的解答。据四省农民代表（即河北、山西、平原、察哈尔）的详细介绍，华北广大农村蕴藏着丰富的工业原料，如察省等地的羊毛，平原地区的棉花、花生，上党的煤、铁及各地的芒硝、油料，都能大批供给工业所需，可以摆脱对外国帝国主义的原料依赖。这首先就解除了他们怀疑农村能否供给原料的顾虑。关于农民的购买力问题，又据不完全统计，这次农民代表计订购与购买的有水车一万余辆，织草袋机一千三百架，草袋一万八千个，磅秤一百八十台，丝钢滚的磨粉机十二部，丙种钢磨十一部，自由式连续榨油机十余部，其他如各种新式农具，杀虫药剂、肥田粉、万能粉碎机、手摇切面机、罗丝板、杆丝锥、云峰孵卵机、细菌培养箱、细粗砂轮、干板、风匣、油烟、云母机、比重表、铅丝、颜色、火柴、色布花布等均订购不少。
