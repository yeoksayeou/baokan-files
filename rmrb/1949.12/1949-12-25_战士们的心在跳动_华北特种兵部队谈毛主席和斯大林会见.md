　　The Hearts of the Soldiers are Beating
　　——North China Special Forces Discuss the Meeting Between Chairman Mao and Stalin
    Chen Ji
    The joyous news of Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union spread to the North China Special Forces, and the soldiers were overjoyed. Before dawn, all the soldiers of a certain company secretly got up and crowded in front of the radio. When the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station announced "Stalin Receives Chairman Mao," all the soldiers of the company jubilantly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" This sound immediately resounded throughout the entire special forces unit.

    Dong Wenjun, the company commander of the motorcycle company, used to be a soldier in the Kuomintang army. He had personally witnessed 150 "foreign hair cars" (洋毛车) that the Soviet Union helped us with driving to Xi'an overnight to help China transport materials. He said, "Those 'foreign hair cars' are more durable and reliable than any other vehicles." At that time, the great Stalin not only helped us with military supplies and materials, but also helped us with the most valuable human resources. Dong Wenjun said with envy that the Soviet people had organized the Soviet Volunteer Air Force to fly to China to assist China in the war of resistance against Japan. In 1938, five aircraft of the Soviet Volunteer Air Force fought nine Japanese aircraft. After they defeated five Japanese aircraft, they were forced to land in Luoyang due to a malfunction on the way from Xi'an to Luoyang. They were monitored by the Japanese Air Force in the air, but they were not afraid at all. The head of the Chinese aviation station advised them to return to Xi'an, but they unanimously refused and said, "We will not go back. We will help the Chinese people fight to the end against Japan! Until the Japanese Air Force withdraws from the Chinese skies." Soldier Wan Enhui said, "This fact shows that with the Soviet Union, the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people is no longer isolated." Wang Zhen, who had fought against the Japanese in the Jin-Cha-Ji area for many years, told me, "At the beginning of the war of resistance, many of our soldiers were still fighting the Japanese with homemade guns, but our confidence in victory was very high because we remembered Chairman Mao's words—the Soviet Union is our example of victory." After the Soviet Union defeated the German invaders, it further strengthened our confidence in victory. Wang Zhen said: We all said at that time, "The victory of the Soviet Union is our victory." Speaking of this, soldier Zhang Zhenhua immediately followed up and said, "Looking back on the past, we more deeply understand the truth of Chairman Mao's 'leaning to one side.'"

    Chairman Mao's meeting with Stalin evoked deep memories in the soldiers. They thought of the friendship and help of the Soviet people and Stalin to the Chinese people in various events. They enthusiastically told me, "Chairman Mao arrived in Moscow carrying the gratitude of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Stalin and the Soviet Union. The victorious Chinese people are now, with the help of the great Soviet Union, starting unprecedented restoration and construction work in railways, mines, factories, and other fields." Yang Yongxiu of the tank regiment personally witnessed Soviet experts hired by our country helping China build bridges destroyed by the enemy in the icy and cold deep water in the Northeast. He said with emotion, "The Soviet Union is the best friend of the Chinese people."

    When I visited the dormitories of the special forces soldiers, I saw slogans like these posted in their dormitories: "Learn from the regular style of the Soviet Red Army!" "Learn from the superb skills of the Soviet Red Army!"

    Soldier Zhang Zhenhua told me, "We must fight more resolutely, learn from the Soviet Union's military construction experience, consolidate our national defense, and repay the Soviet people's friendly assistance."

　　战士们的心在跳动
　　——华北特种兵部队谈毛主席和斯大林会见
    陈迹
    毛主席访问苏联的喜讯传到了华北特种兵部队，战士们欢欣若狂。在天还没有亮的时候，某连全体战士就偷偷地起床了，他们蜂拥在收音机前面。当北京人民广播电台发出“斯大林接见毛主席”的声音时，全连战士欢跃地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”这个声音立即响遍了整个特种兵部队。
    摩托连连长董文军过去在国民党部队中当兵，他曾亲眼看见一夜之间苏联帮助我们的“洋毛车”有一百五十辆开到西安，帮助中国运输物资。他说，“那种‘洋毛车’比什么车子都坚实耐用。”那时候，伟大的斯大林不仅帮助我们军火和物资，而且还帮助我们最可宝贵的人力。董文军羡慕地谈道，苏联人民曾组织过苏联志愿空军，飞到中国来援助中国抗战。在一九三八年，苏联志愿空军队的五架飞机和日本九架飞机作战，当他们打垮了日本五架飞机以后，在从西安到洛阳的途中，因故障被迫落在洛阳，他们受到日本空军的上空监视，但是他们毫不畏惧，中国航空站站长劝他们返回西安，他们一致拒绝地说：“我们不回去，我们要帮助中国人民抗战到底！一直到日本空军退出中国上空为止。”战士万恩辉说：“这个事实，说明了中国人民有了苏联，中国人民的革命斗争就再也不是孤立的了。”曾经在晋察冀抗战多年的王真告诉我说：“抗战才开始，我们许多战士还用土枪和日本人打仗，但是我们的胜利信心很高，因为我们记得毛主席的话——苏联是我们的胜利的榜样。”在苏联击败德寇后，更增强了胜利的信心，王真说：我们那时都这样说，“苏联的胜利就是我们的胜利。”谈到这里，战士张振华马上跟着说：“回想起了过去，我们越深刻体会到毛主席“‘一面倒’的真理”。
    毛主席会见斯大林引起了战士们深深的回忆，他们想到苏联人民和斯大林对中国人民的友谊和帮助种种事迹，他们热情地告诉我：“毛主席是带着中国人民及中国人民解放军对于斯大林和苏联的感激而到达莫斯科的。胜利了的中国人民现在又在伟大苏联的帮助下，在铁路、矿山、工厂等方面已开始从所未有的恢复和建设的工作。战车团的杨永修在东北曾亲眼看见被我国聘请的苏联专家在冰冷的深水里，帮助中国修建被敌人破坏的桥梁的情景，他感动地说，“苏联是中国人民最好的朋友”。
    当我参观特种兵部队战士们的宿舍时，在他们的宿舍里都贴满了这样的标语：“学习苏联红军的正规作风！”“学习苏联红军的精超技术！”
    战士张振华告诉我：“我们要更坚强地战斗下去，学习苏联建军经验，巩固我们的国防，回答苏联人民的友谊的帮助”。
