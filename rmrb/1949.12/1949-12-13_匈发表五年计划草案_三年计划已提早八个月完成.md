Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: According to TASS, Budapest: Hungarian newspapers recently published a draft of the Hungarian Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. The draft's introduction states that Hungary completed its Three-Year Plan eight months ahead of schedule. Industrial output has reached 140% of the pre-war level, agricultural production is approaching pre-war levels, the living standards of the working people have exceeded pre-war levels by an average of 37%, and the health and cultural levels of the people have been raised. The structure of society and the national economy has undergone fundamental changes. Three years ago, manufacturing, mining and metallurgy, banking, foreign trade, and wholesale trade were almost entirely in the hands of capitalists. Today, 92% of industry is controlled by the government, and banking, foreign trade, and wholesale trade are also controlled by the state. In retail trade, the share of state-owned and cooperative enterprises, which was previously about 3%, now accounts for 30%. Three years ago, large-scale collective farming was in its infancy. Today, 7% of all arable land in the country belongs to state farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives, and 220 machine and tractor stations have been established.

　　The Five-Year Plan will prioritize the development of heavy industry and machine manufacturing, increase agricultural production, raise the living standards of the people, educate the people in the socialist spirit, develop culture, train new engineers, doctors, teachers, and managers, develop national defense forces in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, and transform Hungary from an agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country.

　　To accomplish these tasks, the draft Five-Year Plan stipulates a national economic investment of 50.9 billion forints (Hungarian currency) over five years. By 1954, the total value of industrial output will be 186.4% of that of 1949. In 1954, the value of agricultural products will be 142.2% of that of 1949. The Five-Year Plan target stipulates that the living standards of the working people will increase by an average of 35% compared to 1949, reaching 185% by 1954. From 1949 to 1954, the proportion of industrial income in the national income will increase from 49.7% to 58.7%.

　　The draft plan stipulates increased capital investment in industry, agriculture, transportation, and trade. A new heavy machinery factory will be built in Mohács, new furnaces for ferro-manganese alloys and aluminum will be constructed, and the production of machine tools will be increased. Machine tool production, which was worth 185 million forints in 1949, will increase to 610 million forints by 1954. Annual tractor production will increase from 2,600 to 4,600 units, railcar production from 4,850 to 10,000 units, and large trucks will increase to 23,000 units.

　　The draft plan stipulates capital investment in the mechanization of agriculture. In 1954, the state will supply agriculture with 22,800 tractors and will implement large-scale fertilization and the use of advanced science and technology. The state will allocate huge sums for irrigation and the improvement of livestock breeding.

　　The draft plan also stipulates the construction of an underground railway and allocates 7.4 billion forints for housing construction and public health, social, and cultural measures. The supply of daily necessities to the people, schools, research institutions, sanatoriums, rest homes, hospitals, and cultural palaces will also be increased.

　　The draft concludes by stating the necessity of further consolidating and developing economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

　　匈发表五年计划草案
  　三年计划已提早八个月完成
    【新华社北京十二日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利报纸最近发表匈牙利发展国民经济五年计划的草案。草案引言称，匈牙利已提早八个月完成了三年计划，工业产量已达战前一年水平的百分之一四○、农业生产已接近战前水平，劳动人民的生活水平平均超过战前百分之三十七，人民的健康状况和文化水平已经提高，社会和国民经济的结构已经起了根本的变化。三年前，制造业、采矿和冶金工业、银行、对外贸易、批发贸易等几乎完全操在资本家手里。今天，百分之九十二的工业已掌握在政府手里，银行、对外贸易和批发贸易也都操在国家手里。在零售贸易中，国营与合作社企业的部分以前约占百分之三，现在则占百分之三十。三年前，大规模的集体耕作尚在萌芽时期，今日国内全部可耕地百分之七属于国家和农业生产者合作社，并已建立了二百二十个机器和拖拉机站。
    五年计划将首先发展重工业和机器制造工业，增加农业生产，提高人民生活水平，用社会主义精神教育人民，发展文化，训练新的工程师、医生、教师和管理人员，遵照和约规定，发展国防力量，变农业——工业国的匈牙利为工业——农业国。
    为要完成这些任务，五年计划草案规定在五年内国民经济投资为五百零九亿佛罗林（匈币）。到一九五四年，工业总产量的价值将是一九四九年的百分之一百八十六点四。一九五四年农产品的价值将为一九四九年的百分之一百四十二点二。五年计划目标规定劳动人民的生活水平平均要比一九四九年增加百分之三十五，到一九五四年劳动人民的生活水平将达百分之一百八十五。从一九四九年到一九五四年，工业方面的收入在国民收入中所占的比例将从百分之四十九点七增加到百分之五十八点七。
    计划草案规定了增加工业、农业、运输与贸易方面的资产投资。在莫哈克斯建设新的重型机器工厂，建造新的锰铁合金和铝的熔炉，增加工作母机产量，一九四九年已生产了价值一亿八千五百万佛罗林的工作母机，到一九五四年将增加到六亿一千万佛罗林。拖拉机每年产量要从二千六百架增加到四千六百架，车皮生产从四千八百五十辆增加到一万辆，大卡车要增加到二万三千辆。
    计划草案规定了对农业机械化的资产投资。一九五四年国家将供给农业以二万二千八百辆拖拉机，并将大规模施肥和利用先进科学技术。国家将拨巨款作灌溉工作和改进牲畜饲养等之用。
    计划草案又规定建筑地下铁道，拨款七十四亿佛罗林作为房屋建筑、及公共卫生、社会与文化措施之用。对人民的日用品供应，学校、研究机关、疗养院、休憩所、医院与文化宫也将增加。
    草案结尾说到进一步巩固与发展对苏联与各人民民主国家的经济关系之必要性。
