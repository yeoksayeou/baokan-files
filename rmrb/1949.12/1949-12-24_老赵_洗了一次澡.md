　　　　　It’s Much Better in Wuhan Than in Kaifeng
    Old Zhao, a graduate student in the Political Research Office, was overjoyed when he heard that the school was moving to Wuhan from Kaifeng, and he told everyone he met, "It's much better in Wuhan than in Kaifeng!" The Wuhan University campus is famous throughout the country, of course we have to take it over. There are plenty of fish in the south, so I'll definitely get my fill of fish there. We're taking over so many cars, won't we get a few?... In short, the revolutionary situation is developing, and everything will be taken care of.

    　　　　Why Save on These Little Things?
    After arriving in Wuhan, everything seemed dazzling. Streets, shops, scenery... "The great river flows east, thinking of Gongjin; wandering Snake Hill, lamenting Xiao Hong," everything sparked a thought in his mind – quickly resolve the marriage issue. But the reality of daily life annoyed him in every little way: at first, he slept on the floor, and then he got a bed, but that kind of bunk bed gave him a headache as soon as he saw it. He wasn't used to eating rice, and the dishes were too few and didn't suit his taste; what made him even angrier was that the school hadn't found a campus for a long time, and they were living here and there for a few days. The teachers had to run around on foot to give classes (some also rode bicycles), and in that kind of sweltering weather, running so far. So Old Zhao said resentfully, "With such development of the revolution, why save on these little things for us cadres?"

    Immediately afterwards, the call for streamlining and saving was put forward in the newspapers. After reading it, he sneered, saying nothing, but thinking to himself: Here they go again! How much more can we "save"? Could it be that they'll even cancel the Political Research Office?

    　　　　Ah, So That's How It Is
    Soon, the school authorities gave a detailed and thorough report on the details of this streamlining and saving effort. After listening, Old Zhao suddenly realized, "Ah, so that's how it is! I used to think that the revolution had developed, that the wealth of the revolution had increased, and that no matter how much we spent, we could never spend it all. Who would have thought that there would be such problems in finance, who would have thought that there would be so many difficulties on the road of revolutionary progress? I understand now that streamlining and saving are absolutely necessary for the complete victory of the people of the whole country." But he was satisfied with understanding, and as for how to actually carry out streamlining and saving, that would depend solely on the school authorities' plan, and we would just wait for orders.

    　　　　There's Something For Us To Do Here!
    The Political Research Office arranged to bring the movement to each group for discussion. In addition to discussing how to actually carry out the movement in a concrete way, the main emphasis was on the ideological issues related to the movement for each individual, treating the movement as an ideological movement. Old Zhao said in surprise, "There's something for us to do here!" Group discussions began, and the students first criticized him for gradually developing hedonistic ideas after arriving in Wuhan. He got angry. Finally, one student, with an impassioned tone, said to him, "Have you ever thought that the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines, even at this very minute, has people being torn apart by flesh and blood? We are in the rear, shielded from the wind and rain. If we don't wholeheartedly serve the people, but complain about poor living conditions and bad food, and this and that, are we still revolutionaries?..." He listened, pondering with his head lowered. After the meeting, he remained silent.

    　　　　He Seemed to Have Taken a Bath in a Hot Spring
    Living conditions gradually became strained. In the past, the scraps of paper in the dormitory—said to be scraps of paper, but actually many had nothing written on them—were scattered all over the floor, but now they were gradually decreasing. Each group also sent students to work in the teams, on the one hand to understand the ideological situation of the students in the teams, and on the other hand to help the teachers lecture and answer questions. Then, the school launched a production movement, collectively reclaiming wasteland, making preparations for planting vegetables and other kinds of production. In the wasteland reclamation, the sound of songs and the sound of hoes echoed each other. Even the school leaders with white hair and beards participated, playing a leading role....

    "The Communist Party is hardworking and enduring." In the past, Old Zhao had only heard about it, but now he could see it with his own eyes. "Everyone is so active, am I, Old Zhao, not serving the people?" Old Zhao unknowingly got caught up in the tide of this movement. "Take a break, Old Zhao." "I'm not tired!" The next day when he went to work, a classmate saw a cloth tied around his hand: "What's wrong with your hand?" "I got a blister." "Take a break, won't you?" "It's okay." The third day when he went to work, a classmate asked him again, "How's your hand?" "The blister has broken." On the fourth and fifth days, when his classmates asked about his hand again, he smiled and said, "The blister is healed, my hands are full of calluses..."

    One night, after the lights-out bell rang, the classmates fell asleep quickly because they had participated in production during the day. Old Zhao was lying in bed, also falling asleep, when he happened to see that the light in the kitchen was still on. He turned over and sat up, heard that it was raining hard outside, and lay down again. But as soon as he lay down, he suddenly sat up again. What made him sit up again? Responsibility. This responsibility was not explicitly stipulated by the school, nor was it given to him by anyone face to face, but he had this feeling in his heart. It was this feeling that made him unable to sleep. He quickly got up, braved the rain, walked to the kitchen, gently turned off the light, and turned back, soaking wet, but he felt very comfortable in his heart, as if he had taken a bath in a hot spring.

　　老赵“洗了一次澡”
    薄自勉
  　　　　　到武汉总比开封强的多啦
    政治研究室的研究生老赵。在开封时，一听说学校要迁到武汉，就高兴得碰跳，逢人便说：“到武汉总比开封强的多啦！”武大的校址是全国有名的，当然得接收过来。江南多鱼，到那里一定能过鱼瘾。接收那样多的汽车，不得分几辆吗……。总起来说，革命的形势是发展了，一切都有办法了。
    　　　　何必节省这点东西呢
    到武汉后，一切都觉得耀眼。街道、商店、风景……。“大江东去想公瑾，蛇山漫游叹萧红，”一切都引起他一个感想——赶快解决婚烟问题。可是实际生活一点一滴都使他烦恼：起先睡的是地板，后来有床了，可是那种两层床，他一见就头痛。大米他吃不惯，菜又少又不合口；更使他生气的，是学校许久没有找到校址，东住几天，西住几天，教员上课，还得用腿跑（有的也骑辆脚踏车），那样的酷暑天气，跑的又那么远。于是老赵忿忿然地说：“革命这样的发展，何必在我们干部身上节省这点东西呢？”
    紧接着在报纸上就提出精简节约的号召。他看罢，冷笑一下，嘴里不说，心中暗想：又搞这一套哩！再节约还怎么“节”法？难道把政研室也取消？
    　　　　啊，原来是这样的呀
    不久，学校当局，把这次精简节约的详情细节，作了次详明精尽的报告。老赵听罢，才恍然大悟的说：“啊，原来是这样的呀！从前老以为革命是发展了，革命的财富是多了，无论怎样化也化不完了，谁想到财政上还会有这样的问题，谁想到在革命的前进道上还会有这样多的困难呢？我现在明白了，为了全国人民的彻底胜利，精简节约是非常必要的了。”可是他明白了就完事，究竟怎样在实际上展开精简节约，那只靠学校当局的计划，我们静候命令就完啦。
    　　　　这里头还有我们的事啦
    政研室布置了：要把这个运动提到各个小组去讨论，讨论的内容，除怎样在实际上具体展开这个运动外，主要的还侧重于每个人对这个运动有关的思想问题，要把这个运动当成一个思想运动去处理。老赵愕然的说：“这里头还有我们的事啦！”小组讨论开始了，同学们首先批评他：到武汉后，逐渐增长了享乐思想。他生气了，最后有个同学，带着激昂的声调，对他说：“你没有想想，在前方作战的解放军，就在这一分钟也有人血肉横飞，我们在后方，风吹不着，雨淋不着，要不实心实意的为人民服务，还嫌住的不好啦，吃的不好啦，这啦那啦，我们还算是一个革命者吗？……”他听着，低头寻思了。散会后，他一直默不作声。
    　　　　他好象在温泉里洗了一次澡
    生活情况，逐渐紧张起来。从前，寝室里的字纸——说是字纸，其实很多并没有写字的——满地飞，现在也逐渐减少了。各组并抽派同学到队上去工作，一方面了解队上同学的思想情况，一方面帮着教员讲课解答问题。接着，校部又发动生产运动，集体开荒，作种菜和别种生产的准备。在开荒中，嘴里的歌声和手里的镢头声应和着。甚至须发斑白的学校负责人，也都参加进来，起着带头的作用……。
    “共产党是克苦耐劳的”。从前只在老赵的耳朵里听过，现在可在老赵的眼睛里见过了。“大家都这样积极，偏偏我老赵就不是为人民的？”老赵也就不知不觉的卷入这个运动的浪潮。“歇歇吧，老赵。”“不累啊！”第二天上工的时候，同学见他手上勒条布：“怎么啦，手？”“磨泡啦。”“歇歇吗，你。”“不要紧啊。”第三天上工的时候，同学又问他：“手怎样呀？”“泡已经破了。”第四天、第五天，同学们又问他的手的时候，他微笑着说：“泡好了，满手都磨成茧子了……。”
    有一天晚上，打了熄灯钟以后，同学们因为白天参加了生产，都很快的睡着了。老赵躺在床上，也正在入睡的时候，偶然看见厨房里的那盏电灯，还没有熄，他翻身坐起来，听见外面的雨下得正紧，就又躺下了。可是刚一躺下，就又突然坐起来。谁叫他又坐起来的呢？责任。这责任，不是校内明文规定的，也不是任何人当面交给的，只是他内心里有这么一种感觉，也就是这种感觉，使他睡不下去了。他很快的起来，冒着雨，走到厨房里，轻轻的拧熄了电灯，转回来，淋得一身尽湿，可是他心里非常舒服，好象在温泉里洗了一次澡。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九、十、五、武昌。
