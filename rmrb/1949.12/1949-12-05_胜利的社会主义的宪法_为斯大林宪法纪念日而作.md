　　The Constitution of Victorious Socialism
    ——Written for the Anniversary of the Stalin Constitution——
    By Sudaříkov, Translated by Chen Hanzhang
    Exactly thirteen years ago—on December 5, 1936, the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets adopted a new Soviet Constitution (Fundamental Law).
    The Congress designated that day—December 5th—as an annual national holiday. And since then, a new important day—Stalin Constitution Day—has appeared among the many important days commemorated by the Soviet people and has entered the daily life of the Soviets.
    Thirteen years have passed, and many, many new years will pass, but the historical significance of the day the new Constitution became the fundamental and unchanging law of all life and multifaceted activities of the Soviet socialist state will never lose its brilliance.
    In the history of class society spanning countless centuries, there have been many great constitutional reforms, many of which have been significant markers in the development of state legal forms.
    For example, the constitutional decrees of 17th-century England: the "Petition of Right" (1628), the "Agreement of the People" (1647), the Habeas Corpus Act (1679), and the "Bill of Rights" are such constitutional reforms, and these decrees have become the foundation of the current unwritten constitution of England. Certain theorists have lauded these decrees to the skies, and countless books have been written about them—however, these decrees merely reflected the struggle of the British bourgeoisie against autocratic rule and did not intend to introduce any fundamental changes in the social system and state system.
    The numerous constitutions and legislative decrees of the French Revolution—from the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" (1789) to the Constitution of June 15, 1852—were also of this kind. This constitution essentially nullified the achievements of the three revolutions and paved the way for Louis-Napoleon to declare himself Emperor of France on July 29, 1852, restoring the former monarchy with only slight modifications.
    Of this kind is also the "Declaration of Independence" solemnly adopted by the American Continental Congress, and the Constitution of 1789, which has formally remained in effect to this day; but at every step, it is even violated and spurned by those representatives of the ruling class, whose ancestors once considered this constitution to be the pinnacle of the formal development of general bourgeois democratic states. Comrade Stalin, in explaining the characteristics and features of bourgeois constitutions, pointed out:
    "From a democratic point of view, all bourgeois constitutions can be divided into two categories: The first category directly denies equality of rights and democratic freedoms, or effectively nullifies equality of rights and democratic freedoms. The second category is happy to accept, even to flaunt, the principles of democracy, but at the same time adds many conditions and restrictions that utterly undermine democratic rights and freedoms." (Problems of Leninism, p. 682).
    Why have all past constitutions failed the test of history and inevitably lost their significance? The fundamental reason is that these constitutions aimed to permanently maintain and consolidate the economic and political foundations of the society that formed under their conditions.
    However, no matter from what direction such attempts come, they are destined to fail.
    The course of history cannot be hindered, let alone turning the wheels of history backward. Movement means forward movement, the objective law of social development. If, under the banner of the Stalin Constitution, the working masses of the Soviet Union are gaining new victories year after year, and if not only the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, but also the various nationalities of many other countries, are advancing along the path indicated by the Stalin Constitution, then where does its greatness lie?
    The great mobilizing and organizing force of the Stalin Constitution lies primarily in the fact that it expresses in legislative form the economic and political foundations of a completely new and unprecedented social system—the socialist system.
    The Stalin Constitution is the constitution of socialism that has already triumphed in the Soviet Union. Socialism has already triumphed in all aspects of our economic, political, and cultural life. This victory is reflected in every article of the Fundamental Law.
    The victory of socialism in the economic sphere is manifested in the fact that public ownership of the means of production and means of labor—land, factories—has long become the inseparable and dominant form in the Soviet Union.
    By the beginning of the Third Five-Year Plan, namely in 1940, the proportion of socialist property was as follows: 99.9 percent in the total value of industrial products, 98.8 percent in the total value of agricultural products, and 100 percent in commercial circulation (in commerce).
    As can be seen from Article 5 of the Constitution, there are two forms of public socialist ownership in the Soviet Union: state ownership (property of the entire workers, peasants, and Soviet intellectuals, i.e., the property of the whole people) and cooperative collective farm ownership (property of various collective farms and cooperatives).
    It would be a great mistake and a distortion of Soviet reality to think that public socialist ownership is to swallow up and exclude the possibility of the development of individual citizens' private property. Article 10 of the Constitution stipulates very clearly that "the right of citizens to personal ownership of their income from labor and savings, of their dwelling houses and subsidiary household economy, their household articles and articles of personal use and convenience, as well as the right of citizens to inherit personal property, is protected by law." Only enemies of socialism, only enemies of the Soviet system, can insist that it seems that in the Soviet Union, citizens' private property rights to their property, income from labor, and savings are restricted.
    In reality, this is not at all the case. The entire system of measures meticulously designed by the Soviet state is to protect the private property of every citizen, property that is not acquired by occupying the labor of others, but by gloriously, honestly, and nobly working for society and for oneself. Therefore, the guarantee of private property in our country is not only the private affair of the citizen who holds such property. The state itself, represented by various state organs, is also concerned with protecting the private property rights of citizens. To give just one example, Article 2 of the currently effective Russian Federation Code of Civil Procedure requires the Procurator-General, as a representative of the state, to appear in court to participate in any civil case when he deems it necessary to protect the interests of the state or citizens whose rights have been violated. The directive of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on June 4, 1947, stipulates that in our country, whoever steals the private property of others will be held seriously criminally responsible.
    But the most solid guarantee of the private property rights of Soviet citizens is the constantly growing economic power of the Soviet state, on the basis of which the material well-being of the working people is constantly improving day by day.
    The Stalin Constitution stipulates that the economic foundation of the Soviet Union is not only socialist ownership but also the socialist economic system. This means that the Fundamental Law of the state is promoting the consolidation and development of new production relations, that is, the mutual relations between people in the process of producing the material means necessary for survival.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out in his work "On Dialectical and Historical Materialism": Production relations may be "relations of cooperation and mutual assistance among people free from exploitation," may be "relations of domination and subordination," or may be transitional relations from one form of production relations to another. (Concise Course of the History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union, Russian version, p. 115). The Stalin Constitution expressly stipulates the socialist type of production relations, that is, the production relations of cooperation and mutual assistance. This provision is reflected very clearly in Article 12 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "work in the USSR is a duty and a matter of honour for every citizen capable of working, according to the principle: 'He who does not work, neither shall he eat'. In the USSR is being realised the socialist principle: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his work'."
    Labor in our country has long been transformed from a difficult and shameful burden (as it is under imperialism) into a glorious, staunch, and heroic undertaking. In our country, there is no one who does not participate in social production in any form.
    As Comrade Molotov pointed out in one of his speeches, everyone in our country is a worker, and this is truly the case. The passive laziness, idleness, and aimless and contentless wasting of time that some bourgeois aesthetic literary representatives have praised are regarded in our country as the worst kind of social defect. On the contrary, the laboring person—the person who creates all the material and cultural means of the world—strides freely in our free Soviet land and is respected and honored by society. Labor—that is, beneficial productive activity—in the broad sense of the word, has essentially become a daily need of the Soviet people.
    However, regrettably, there are still a very, very few people in our country who, like painful memories of past years, still want to rely on others to live without working and are still hindering us from moving forward. According to the Stalin Constitution, which is the legal basis of current legislation, such people must be punished ruthlessly and must also be subjected to the more severe social condemnation and spiritual resistance of the vast majority of Soviet people.
    These are the good results of the implementation of the Stalin Constitution principles reflecting the achievements of socialism in the economic sphere.
    The Stalin Constitution also reflects the achievements of socialism in the political sphere, because, in accordance with the changes in the Soviet economy, the class structure of our society has also changed.
    Many centuries of history are the history of class development. Classes arise with the emergence of private property, and people's belonging to which class depends on the position they occupy in relation to the means of production and means of labor. Those who control the means of production and means of labor constitute the ruling privileged class. Those who are deprived of the means of production and means of labor form the oppressed class and have to endure all the terrors of a poor life without rights or guarantees.
    Before the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in our country, it was not only an economically and technologically backward country but also a country torn apart by irreconcilable internal class contradictions.
    In a relatively short period of time, under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin, one of the most difficult tasks has been solved in many difficult tasks: the elimination of the exploiting classes. The social faces of the proletariat, the peasantry, and the intellectuals have undergone fundamental changes.
    The vanguard of our society—the proletariat—has become a completely new class, namely the working class, which, together with the entire people, controls the means of production and means of labor. The economic system of the exploiters has been eliminated, socialist ownership of the means of production and means of labor has been established, and Soviet society has been led onto the road of communist construction.
    The most numerous class of peasants has now become unrecognizable. If, at the time of the socialist revolution in 1917, Russian agriculture was "a vast ocean formed by countless small individual farmers operating with backward medieval technology," then by the time the new constitution was adopted—1936 (not to mention now)—the vast majority of peasants were already collective farmers. It does not establish its work and property with individual labor and backward technology, but with collective labor and modern technology. The economic basis of our peasants is no longer private ownership but collective ownership. On the land of collective farms in our country, we can now see no plows and wooden rakes. More than 500,000 tractors, nearly 180,000 combine harvesters, and 220,000 cars are cultivating these lands.
    In our country, due to the influence of socio-economic conditions, a completely new intelligentsia has been formed. It is closely linked to the working class and the peasantry and is an equal member of Soviet society. Together with the working class and the peasantry, it is building a communist society.
    To say that people engaged in intellectual labor in the Soviet Union seem to be secondary and restricted in their ability and talent is a malicious slander of the enemy, which we have indignantly refuted. In our country, the honest labor of every person is respected, especially intellectual labor that serves the purpose of making the forces of nature subordinate to people, of studying the laws of natural and social development in order to influence these laws and accelerate development.
    Among our enemies, some insist that the development of intellectual laborers in the Soviet Union may be restricted. But no one can refute the fact that our schools and scientific institutions now have 100,000 scientific workers, including 10,000 scientific doctors and professors, and nearly 25,000 scientific masters and university lecturers. Speaking of pre-revolutionary Russia, there were only a few thousand scientific workers in total, and the number of scientific masters and doctors did not exceed one thousand. The total number of people engaged in intellectual labor in the Soviet Union has reached a huge figure—13 million. Where, in which country, can there be such a number?
    In capitalist countries, the glorious representatives of intellectual labor cannot feel spiritually satisfied. Because the reactionary bourgeoisie, as Marx said a hundred years ago, has already deprived various activities of their sacred honor. And this activity has always been considered glorious, and people have regarded them reverently. The reactionary bourgeoisie tries to turn doctors, jurists, pastors, poets, and scientific figures into their own marketable hired laborers.
    The changes that have taken place in the working class and the peasantry, the growth and consolidation of the Soviet intellectuals who sincerely serve the people, are a clear manifestation of the victory of socialism in the political sphere, and this victory has been consolidated in the Stalin Constitution by legislative means.
    Socialism has also triumphed in the cultural sphere in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin pointed out when talking about the October Revolution: "The characteristic of our revolution that distinguishes it from other revolutions is that it not only gives the people freedom from the Tsarist system and capitalism, but it also fundamentally improves the people's material and cultural conditions. And its strength and invincibility lie in this."
    The general picture of the cultural upsurge of the Soviet people is manifested in: the universal primary compulsory education system taught in the languages of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, the growth in the number of schools, the increase in the number of students, the increase in the number of experts graduating from higher schools, the increase in the number of universally established scientific and cultural education institutions, and the popularity of radio, film, publications, and theater.
    Based on the above points, the Soviet Union now occupies a leading position in the world.
    There are now nearly 200,000 primary and secondary schools in the Soviet Union, where more than 30 million young people and children are receiving education. In our country, there are 1.2 million teachers alone, which is equal to the total population of several United Nations member states, and these countries want to play the same role as the Soviet Union and China when solving international problems!
    In our country, there are eight hundred higher schools, where 670,000 university students are receiving education, that is to say: more than the total number of university students in European countries. More than 100,000 experts with higher education graduate every year. In the three seasons of 1947, 450,000 young experts graduated from higher schools, technical vocational schools, and other secondary specialized schools. (To be continued)

　　胜利的社会主义的宪法
    ——为斯大林宪法纪念日而作——
    苏达里可夫著  陈汉章译
    整整十三年以前——一九三六年十二月五日非常第八次全苏联苏维埃代表大会，通过了一个新的苏联宪法（根本法）。
    代表大会把通过宪法的那一天——十二月五日，定为每年的全民节日。而从那时候起，一个新的重要日子——斯大林宪法节，就出现在其他许多为苏联人民所纪念的重要日子中，并且已经进入苏维埃人的日常生活。
    十三个年头已经过去了，而还要渡过许多许多的新的岁月，但是新宪法之成为苏维埃社会主义国家全部生活，和多方面活动的基本的不变规律的日子底历史意义，将永远不会失去光彩。
    在无数世纪的阶级社会发展史中，有过不少巨大的宪法改革，其中的许多改革，曾是国家法律形态发展的显著标志。
    例如十七世纪英国的宪法法令：“权利请愿书”（一六二八年）、“国民协定”（一六四七年）、Ｈａｂｅａｓ　ｃｏｒｐｕｓ　ａｃｔ（一六七九年）“权利法案”就是这样的一些宪法改革，而这些法令是已经成了目前英国的现行不成文宪法之基础。若于理论家们把这些法令捧到了九霄云外，关于它们为了无数的书籍——然而这些法令仅仅反映了英国资产阶级反对专制主义统治的斗争，而一点也没有想在社会制度和国家的制度中加入某些根本的改变。
    法国革命时期的无数宪法和立法法令——自“人权宣言”（一七八九年）起，至一八五二年六月十五日的宪法止，也是这类的法令，这一个宪法是在本质上把三次革命的成果化为乌有，而替一八五二年七月二十九日宣布自己为法兰西皇帝路易·拿破仑扫清了道路，他恢复了以前的君主制度，只稍稍改变了一下。
    这类的法令，还有美国大陆国会庄严地通过的“独立宣言”，和一七八九年的宪法，这个宪法在形式上一直保持效力到现在；但是在每一个步骤上，甚至被那些统治阶级中的代表人物所破坏唾弃着，而这些代表人物的祖先，却曾经认为这个宪法是一般的资产阶级民主国家形式发展底顶峰。斯大林同志在说明资产阶级宪法底特征和特点时指出：
    “从民主主义观点看来，各资产阶级宪法可分两项：第一类宪法，直接否认公民平权和民主自由，或在事实上把公民平权和民主自由化为乌有。另一类宪法乐意接受，甚至标榜民主主义原则，但同时又加上许多附带条件与限制，而把民主权利与自由损伤无余”。（列宁主义问题六八二页）。
    为什么所有过去的宪法都经不住历史的考验，而不可避免地丧失其意义？其基本原因，是在于：这些宪法曾指望永久保持和巩固那个他们在其条件下形成起来的社会底经济和政治基础。
    然而，不论众何方而来的各种这样的企图，是早就命定要失败的。
    历史的进程决不能阻挠，更不能把历史的车轮引向后退，运动就是指前进的运动，是社会发展的客观规律。如果在斯大林宪法的旗帜下，苏联的劳动群众，每年在获得一个一个的新的胜利，如果不仅苏联各族人民，而且还有其他许多国家的各族人民，正在沿着斯大林宪法所指示的道路前进，那么，它的伟大是在什么地方呢？
    斯大林宪法底伟大的动员力量和组织力量首先是在于它在立法的形式中表现出全新的空前未有的社会制度——社会主义制度底经济基础和政治基础。
    斯大林宪法是在苏联已经获得胜利的社会主义底宪法。社会主义已经在我国经济的政治的文化的生活的各方面获得了胜利。这种胜利是表现在根本法底每一个条文中。
    社会主义底胜利在经济方面是表现于：苏联对生产资料和生产工具——土地、工厂——的公有制，早已成为不可分的统治形式。
    到第三个五年计划之初即一九四○年，社会主义财产所占的比重如下：在工业产品总额中占百分之九十九点九，在农业产品总额中占百分之九十八点八，在商业流通中（商业中）占百分之一百。
    从宪法第五条中可以看到，在苏联公共的社会主义所有制有二种形式：国家所有制形式（为全体工人、农民、苏维埃知识分子，即全民底财产）和合作社集体农场所有制形式（为各集体农场与合作社财产）。
    如果认为公共的社会主义所有制，是吞并和排除个别公民底私人财产的发展可能，那就是极大的错误和对苏维埃现实的歪曲。宪法第十条极其明确地规是：“公民对其劳动收入及储蓄、住宅及家庭副业、家常用具及必需品、消费品及享乐品之个人所有权，以及公民个人财产之继承权“均受法律之保护”。只有社会主义底敌人，只有苏维埃制度底敌人才能硬说似乎在苏联，公民对其财物，劳动收入和贮蓄的私人财产所有权是受到限制的。
    实际上这完全不是如此的，苏维埃国家所以精密设计出来的各种措施底整个制度，来保护每个公民的私人财产，这种财产不是由于占有任何他人的劳动，而是由于为了社会，同时为了自己而付出光荣、诚实和高贵的劳动之结果而获得的私人财产，所以在我国对于私人财产的保证，不仅是握有此种财产的公民自己的私事。而以各个国家机关为代表的国家本身，也在关心着公民底私人财产权的保护。这里只举一个例子，在目前现行的俄罗斯联邦民事诉讼法第二条责成作为国家代表的检察长，在他认为因国家或公民之权利遭受侵犯，而有保护其利益之必要时，应出庭参加任何民事案件。在最高苏维埃主席团一九四七年六月四日的指令中规定，在我们国家里谁要是窍盗他人的私人财产，谁就要负严重的刑事责任。
    但是对苏联公民私人财产权的最巩固的保证，乃是苏维埃国家底不断增长的经济威力，在它的基础上，劳动者底物质优裕生活在每天不断地改善着。
    在斯大林宪法中规定，苏联的经济基础不仅是社会主义的所有制而且也是社会主义的经济制度。这就是说国家底根本法，在促进着新的生产关系即人在生产为生存所必要的物质资料过程中的相互关系底巩固和发展。
    斯大林同志在其“论辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”的著作中指出：生产关系可能是“不受剥削的人们彼此间的合作和互助关系，”可能是“统治和服从的关系”，可能是由一个生产关系形式过渡到另一个生产关系形式的过渡关系、（联共（布）党史简明教程俄文版第一一五页）斯大林宪法明文规定了社会主义型的生产关系即合作和互助的生产关系，这一条在宪法第十二条中获得了极其明确的反映。该条规定“按‘不劳动者不得食’之原则，劳动为苏联每一有劳动能力公民应尽义务与光荣事业，在苏联实行‘各尽所能，按劳取酬’之社会主义原则。”
    劳动在我国早就已经由艰难可耻的重负（像它在帝国主义条件下所表现的那样），变成了光荣刚毅和英勇的事业，在我国是没有以任何形式而不参加社会生产的人。
    莫洛托夫同志在其一篇演说中指出，在我国大家都是劳动者，而这是真正如此的。像有些资产阶级唯美主义文学代表所歌颂的那种消极懒散，无所事事无目的无内容的消磨时间的作风，在我国被看作是最坏的一种社会缺点。相反的，劳动的人——创造了世界的一切物质和文化资料的人，却在我国自由的苏维埃土地上昂首阔步，并受到社会的尊敬和荣誉。劳动——即有益的生产活动。在这个字的广泛意义上讲，本质上已经成了苏维埃人的日常需要。
    然而遗憾得很，在我国也还有那样一些很少很少的人，他们像对过去岁月的痛苦回忆一样，还想依赖他人不劳动而生活，还在妨碍着我们向前迈进。根据作为目前立法的法律基础的斯大林宪法，这种人是要受到无情的惩罚，而且还要受到绝大多数的苏维埃人的更严厉的社会责难和精神抵制。
    这就是反映了社会主义在经济方面成就的斯大林宪法原则实现底良好结果。
    斯大林宪法同样也反映了在政治方面的社会主义的成就，因为与苏联经济方面的变更相适应，我国社会的阶级结构也起了变化。
    许多世纪的历史，是阶级发展史。阶级是随着私有财产之出现而产生的，而人们之属于何种阶级，是取决于他们对生产工具和生产资料的关系所占有的地位而定。掌握着生产工具和生产资料的人，就构成统治特权的阶级。被削夺了生产工具和生产资料的人，就形成被压迫阶级，而不得不去经受毫无权利毫无保障的贫穷生活的全部恐怖。
    当伟大的十月社会主义革命，在我国获得胜利以前，它不仅是一个在经济技术方面落后的国家，而且是一个为内部不可调和的阶级矛盾弄得支离破碎的国家。
    在较短的期间内，在共产党的领导下，在列宁和斯大林的指引下，在许多困难任务中，一个最困难的任务已经得到解决：消灭了剥削阶级。无产阶级、农民阶级、知识分子的社会面貌已起了根本的变化。
    我们社会的先锋队——无产阶级已经变成一个完全新的阶级即工人阶级，他与全体人民一起掌握着生产工具和生产资料。消灭了剥削者的经济制度，奠定了生产工具和生产资料的社会主义所有制，并把苏维埃社会引上共产主义建设的道路。
    为数最多的农民阶级，现在已经变得难以辩认了，如果在一九一七年社会主义革命发生的时候，俄国的农业是“由无数用中世纪落后技术经营的细小个体农户所形成的一片汪洋大海。”那么到通过新宪法时——一九三六年（现在更不用说了），农民的绝大多数已经是集体农民了，它不是以个体的劳动和落后的技术，而是集体的劳动和现代的技术来树立起自己的工作和财产，我国农民的经济基础已不是私人的所有制而是集体的所有制。在我国集体农场的土地上现在已看不到犁和木耙，耕种这些土地的有五十万架以上的拖拉机，将近十八万架的康拜因机，二十二万辆汽车。
    在我国，由于社会经济条件的影响，已经形成了完全新的知识分子。它与工人阶级和农民是息息想观的，并为苏维埃社会平等的一员，它与工人阶级和农民一起建设着共产主义社会。
    说在苏联似乎智力劳动的人是次要的，和被限制发挥其能力和天才之可能的那是敌人的恶意诽谤，而为我们愤慨的驳斥了的。在我国每一个人的正直劳动是受到尊崇的，特别是服务于使自然力量服从于人，服务于研究自然和社会发展规律，以便影响这些规律，并加速发展之目的的，脑力劳动更是受到尊崇。
    在我们的敌人中，有人硬说好像在苏联智力劳动者之发展，可能是受到限制的。但谁也不能驳倒这一事实：我国的学校和科学机关，现在计有十万个科学工作者，其中有一万个科学博士和教授，有将近二万五千个科学学士和大学讲师。说到革命前的俄国总共只有几千个科学工作者，而科学学士和博士是超不过一千人。在苏联从事于智力劳动的人的总数，已经达到了巨大的数字——一千三百万人。在什么地方，在那一个国家能够有这样的数字呢？
    在资本主义国家里，智力劳动的光荣的代表者，是不可能感到精神上的满足的。因为反动的资产阶级，正如马克思在一百年以前所说过的那样，是已经剥夺了各种活动的神圣荣誉。而这种活动一直被认为是光荣的，并且人们是虔敬的来看待他们的。反动的资产阶级，企图把医生、法学家、牧师、诗人、科学人物变成他们自己可以买卖的雇佣劳动者。
    在工人阶级和农民身上所发生的变化，诚实的服务于人民的苏维埃知识分子的生长和巩固，是社会主义在政治方面胜利的明显表现，而这种胜利是已经用立法的方法巩固在斯大林宪法之中。
    在苏联社会主义也在文化方面获得了胜利。斯大林同志在说到十月革命时指出：“我国革命之有别于其他革命的特点，这就是它不仅给予人民以摆脱沙皇制度、摆脱资本主义的自由，而且它还根本改善了人民的物质和文化状况。而它的力量和不可战胜性也就是在这地方。”
    苏维埃人民的文化高涨的一般情景，是表现在：用苏联各民族的语言教学的普及初级义务教育制度，学校数目的增长，学生数目的增加，在高级学校毕业的专家数目的增长，普遍设立的科学文化教育机关的增加及无线电、电影、出版物、戏剧的普及之中。
    根据以上所指出的这些，苏联现在在世界上占有首要的地位。
    在苏联现在有将近二十万所初级学校和中学，在这些学校里，有三千万以上的青年和儿童在受教育。单就教员来说在我们国家里就有一百二十万人，即等于若干联合国会员国的人口总数，而这些国家在解决国际问题时，是想与苏联和中国具有同样的作用！
    在我们国家里，有八百所高级学校，在这些学校里有六十七万大学生在受教育，就是说：比欧洲各国的大学生总数还要多。具有高等教育的专家，每年的毕业人数在十万人以上。在一九四七年的三季中，有四十五万个年青的专家，毕业于高级学校、技术职业学校和其他中等专门学校。（未完）
