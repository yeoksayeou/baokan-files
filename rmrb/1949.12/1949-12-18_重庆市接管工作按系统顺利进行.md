When each department carried out the takeover, they understood the situation, explained the policies to the old personnel, dispelled their concerns, and ensured that the takeover work proceeded in good order.

In addition, the Public Security Department of the Chongqing Military Control Commission began work on the 4th, and the city's traffic order, sanitation, fire protection, and other institutions have all been restored. Thirty-seven of the thirty-nine traffic command posts in the urban area have been restored. Since the establishment of the "Registration Committee for Police Personnel Remaining in Chongqing," more than 1,200 people have registered in three days. The Public Security Department has convened a meeting of former police officers to explain the policies to them and assign them appropriate jobs.
