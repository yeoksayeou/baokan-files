The Story of Stalin
Li Bozhao

Comrade Weiqun was surrounded by a group of young people who wanted him to tell stories about Stalin. He was excellent at storytelling. But this time, he was stumped. Any story would be fine, but stories about Stalin were hard to tell because Stalin was too great. He was afraid he wouldn't do it justice. But seeing everyone's eager and tense faces, he knew he had to tell it.

　　　　(I) Telling the Story of Stalin's Participation in the Revolution

In Gori, Georgia, in the Tiflis province of Russia, a shoemaker and the daughter of a serf from the village of Hambaleuli, Glaze, had a son named Joseph Stalin. As a child, he was intelligent and eager to learn. The South Caucasus was the center of the industrial proletariat. While a student at the Orthodox seminary, he liked to befriend workers, believing that workers were the most worthy people in the world. After he became involved with a clandestine Marxist group in Russian South Caucasus, he was responsible for guiding a workers' group at a railway repair shop. He treated these workers as teachers, sitting and discussing struggles with them. He considered reading as important as eating, devoting himself to studying Marx's *Das Kapital*, the *Communist Manifesto*...and many secret publications. By the age of fifteen, he had become a revolutionary and quickly shed the habits of childhood, becoming an outstanding young warrior who loved truth. Stalin wrote the editorial for the first issue of the South Caucasus Struggle Newspaper.

　　　　(II) Telling the Story of Stalin as Lenin's Disciple

The relationship between Stalin and Lenin is quite interesting: it was truly the most precious friendship and class feeling in the world. He hadn't even met Lenin, but he had read his books and corresponded with him. He studied Lenin's revolutionary theories from *Iskra* and firmly believed, "Lenin is an extraordinary person." He determined: "Lenin is not an ordinary leader of our party, but the actual creator of our party, because only he understands the internal essence and pressing needs of our party, is the epitome of supreme leadership, and is an eagle." Stalin himself was also an eagle, with extraordinary talent. Truth, coming from his mouth, was as easy as ice cream melting in the mouth and quickly became vivid and lively language, knowledge that ordinary people could understand. Listen to how he promoted Lenin's truth. He said, "Theory without practical connection is like a compass on a ship that is not used; it will rust and eventually have to be thrown into the water. A practical movement without the guidance of theory is like a large ship without a compass." "Combine the two, and you have a very good ship that will sail to the other shore and safely approach the dock." He greatly admired Lenin and often thought of meeting him.

The Tsar was very uneasy about Stalin, this dangerous element, and arrested and exiled him eight times within ten years. But finally, he arrived at Comrade Lenin's side. Truth is unexpectedly good timing. Stalin very proudly recalled the situation at that time:

"After experiencing prison and exile, I received the Party's order to go to Leningrad to work. There, I had the opportunity to work alongside Comrade Lenin, the teacher of the world's proletariat, and to be active among the Russian workers. It was during the intense struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the time of the imperialist war that I first learned how to be worthy of being a leader of the great working-class party... I have become a skilled revolutionary." In the years of the civil war, wherever there was danger or difficulty, Stalin was sent there, because he was reliable. Wherever he went, victory followed. One day, the greatest sorrow for all mankind: Lenin died. Who would issue orders to the world? The only successor was Lenin's best disciple, Stalin.

　　　　(III) Telling the Story of a Painting

There is a famous Soviet painter named Mur, who specialized in painting Stalin and his eye-catching pipe in a painting. The pipe is smoking, and collective farms, the vicious faces of rich peasants, and countless figures, plans, etc., vaguely appear in the smoke. This painting is wonderful and interesting. He vividly depicted Stalin's thoughtful appearance.

One, two, three Five-Year Economic Plans, meticulously conceived and personally formulated by him, led the entire Soviet people to complete them.

Stalin was a very resourceful person, and his magic weapon was his ability to think and be willing to use his brain. He divided socialist construction into several stages. After each stage, he carefully calculated and checked how many points and inches the production had grown. Was it completed? Was it too far left or too far right? Was it correct or not? He used his sharp eyes to watch for garbage and dust on the road ahead that might hinder progress. Trotskyites and Bukharin and his ilk were the garbage and dust that had accumulated on the road forward. Stalin wielded a big broom and swept them away cleanly. He also paid attention to whether anyone had fallen behind on the road forward and needed help, whether anyone was sitting still because they were tired, or whether anyone's head was spinning at the sight of achievements. If so, he would shout loudly to remind them. He didn't worry in vain. Large groups of organized ranks, Stakhanovites and shock workers, closely followed him, striving to complete the projected socialist course as soon as possible and advance towards a communist society!

　　　profitLoss. (IV) Telling the Story of a Giant

One summer, one hundred and seventy German fascist corps invaded the Soviet Union, and war broke out, interrupting the Soviet Union's peaceful labor and construction. Hitler, the fascist murderer, used a robber-like blitzkrieg against the peace-loving Soviet people. Within ten days, they occupied most of Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, and part of Western Ukraine. The enemy was only thirty kilometers away from the heart of the world's people—Moscow. Stalin issued a sound like a golden bell: "The enemy's goal is to occupy our land soaked in blood and sweat. The Soviet people will never tolerate indifference, panic, or desertion." Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, the red army, navy, and air force in the sky, on the ground, on land, and at sea all listened to Stalin's orders. One Red Army oath: "I am ordered to attack the railway for the third time, either to occupy it or to sacrifice myself. Tell Stalin, I am not afraid. If I had five lives, I would give them all to protect Stalin, the most kind and precious person!" The heart of the world, the pulse of the world, the central nervous system of the world—Stalin, his head full of black hair turned white. One, two, three... pincers encircling the German fascists took their lives. The three imperialist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan collapsed, a significance no less than three October Revolutions.

From Europe to the East, the liberated people will forever remember in their hearts: "Long live, Stalin!"

Stalin—the giant of the world!

　　　　(V) Telling the Story that Giants also Don't Refuse to do Small Things

Giants also do small things. Once, an ordinary worker told Stalin that Moscow didn't have enough water. Scientists also said that Moscow's water source was about to dry up. Stalin was very concerned and brought it up for discussion at the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, organizing a special committee to study the construction of the Moscow Canal. He personally worked with experts to formulate a plan, and after each phase of the project was completed, he personally inspected the project. The Volga River and the Moscow River were connected, transportation from Gorky to Moscow became convenient, and Moscow's water supply problem was solved. Giants handle affairs according to Lenin's important teaching: "In work, never refuse small things, because big things are accumulated from small things."

Stalin—today's Lenin. These stories cannot be finished in one year, two years, or three years. I'll stop here today, and next time I'll talk about Stalin and the Chinese revolution.

Weiqun told stories with great enthusiasm, and the listeners were also very absorbed.

### 斯大林的故事

专栏：

　　斯大林的故事
    李伯钊
    惟群同志被一群青年围住，要他讲斯大林的故事。他是顶会讲故事的。这回可把他难住了，什么故事都好讲，斯大林的故事却难讲，因为斯大林太伟大了，怕讲不好，他看见大家热心紧张的面孔，知道不讲不行了。
    　　　　（一）讲斯大林参加革命
    俄国梯弗里州哥里城格鲁吉亚的皮鞋匠和汉巴勒乌里村农奴格拉则的女儿生了个儿子叫约瑟夫·斯大林。小的时候，聪明好学。南高加索是工业无产阶级的中心区，他在正教中学当学生，好和工人交朋友，认为工人是世界上顶值得亲近的人。自他和南高加索俄罗斯的马克思主义秘密小组发生了关系之后，就负责指导一个铁路修理厂的工人小组，他把这些工人当先生，和他们同起同坐，商量斗争。他把读书当吃饭一样看得重要，专心攻读马克思资本论，共产党宣言……和许多秘密刊物。十五岁就成了革命家，并且很快就从自己身上脱去了童年的习气，成为一位了不起的、热爱真理的青年战士。南高加索斗争报第一期社论就是斯大林执笔写成。
    　　　　（二）讲斯大林是列宁的门生
    提起斯大林和列宁的关系才有趣呢：实在是世界上最珍贵的友谊、阶级的感情。他还没有见过列宁，只读过他的书和他通过信，从火星报上熟读了列宁的革命理论，深信“列宁是个非常的人。”他认定：“列宁不是我们党的普通领导人，而是我们党底实际创造人，因为只有他最了解我们党底内部实质和迫切需要，是最高领导的典型，是个山鹰。”斯大林自己也是山鹰，有非凡的才能，真理到了他的嘴里，象冰膏溶解在口里那么容易很快变成了生动活泼的语言，普通人都可以懂得的学问。听他怎么宣传列宁的真理。他说：“没有实际联系的理论，好象船上的指南针放在那里不用，会生锈，结果只好把它抛弃到水中去。没有理论指导的实际运动呢，好象一只大船没有指南针。”“把两件东西结合起来了，一只很好的大船，一直驶到彼岸，安然靠近码头。”他非常敬仰列宁，常常想着去会列宁。
    沙皇很不放心斯大林这个危险分子，在十年之内，一共逮捕放逐了八次。但是，终于他到了列宁同志的身边真理是料想不到的好时机，斯大林很得意的回忆当时的情形：
    “我经历了牢狱和流放的飘泊生活以后，得到党的命令到列宁格勒去工作，在那里，有机会在全世界无产阶级的导师列宁同志身边工作，在俄国工人中间活动，正是无产阶级反资产阶级斗争激烈，帝国主义打仗的时候，我头一次学会了怎样才配做一个伟大工人阶级政党的领导人……我已成为一个革命的能手了。”在内战的年月里，那里危险，那里困难，斯大林就被派到那里，靠得住，他到那里，胜利就跟到那里。有一天早上起来，全人类最大的悲痛，列宁死了。谁来向全世界发号施令呢？唯一的继承人就是列宁最好的门生斯大林。
    　　　　（三）讲一幅画
    苏联人有个著名的画家叫姆耳，专门把斯大林和他那个惹人注目的大烟斗画了一副画，烟斗正冒烟，烟雾里隐约出现了集体农场、富农的凶像、还有数不清的人物、计划等等。这副画很精彩又有意思。他把斯大林好想问题的神气活画出来了。
    一个，两个，三个五年经济计划，经过他细腻的思维，亲手制定，率领着全苏联人把它完成。
    斯大林是个很有办法的人，他的法宝，就是善于思考，肯花脑筋。他把社会主义建设分成几段路程，每走一段路他又仔细的计算计算，看看一段一段生产长了几分几寸？有没有完成？左了？右了？端正不端正？用锐利的目光注视着前进的大道上有没有垃圾灰尘，阻碍前进。托洛茨基分子布哈林之流就是横积在前进大道上的垃圾灰尘，斯大林挥动大扫帚，扫除的干干净净。他同时也留神前进的道上有没有掉队了需要扶助的，走累了坐着不动的，或是看见成绩头发晕的？有就大吼一声，提醒提醒，他并没有白操心，一大群一大群有组织的行列，斯塔哈诺夫、乌打尔尼克，紧跟着他争取早日走完了预计的社会主义历程，向共产主义社会前进！
    　　　　（四）讲巨人
    有一年的夏天，德国法西斯一百七十个兵团，侵犯苏联，爆发了战争，打断了苏联和平劳动建设。希特勒法西斯杀人犯，对爱好和平的苏联人使用强盗式的闪击。在十天之内占领了立陶宛，拉脱维亚大部，别洛露西亚及西乌克兰的一部分。敌人离全世界人民的心脏——莫斯科只三十公里了，斯大林发出金钟一样的声音：“敌人的目的是要占领我们血汗浸透了的土地，苏联人决不容有漠不关心、张慌失措和临阵逃脱的。”俄罗斯人，乌克兰人，别洛露西亚人，乌兹别克人，鞑靼人，莫尔达维亚人，爱沙尼亚人，立陶宛人，拉脱维亚人，格鲁克亚人，阿尔明里亚人，阿捷尔拜疆人，天上、地下、陆地、海上红色的海陆空军都听斯大林的号令。一个红军的誓词：“我是第三次受命进攻铁路了，或者占领，或者牺牲，告诉斯大林，我不怕，假如我有五个生命的话，一起为了保护斯大林最亲切可贵的人！”全世界的心脏、全世界的脉搏、全世界的神筋中枢——斯大林，他满头的黑发变白了。一次，二次，三次……钳形的包围圈要了德国法西斯的老命。德国，意大利，日本三个帝国主义垮了，实际意义不下于三个十月革命。
    从欧罗巴到东方被解放的人民永远记在心里：“万岁！斯大林！”
    斯大林——全世界的巨人！
    　　　　（五）讲巨人也不拒绝做小事情
    巨人也做小事情。有一回，一个普通的工人告诉斯大林，莫斯科的水不够用了。科学家也说莫斯科水源要枯竭了。斯大林很关心，提到联共中央讨论，组织专门委员会研究修建莫斯科运河。亲自同专门家制订计划，每段工程完了，亲自去检查工程。伏尔加河，莫斯科河连结起来了，从高尔基到莫斯科的交通便利了，莫斯科的水的供应解决了。巨人办事，依照列宁重要的一条遗训：“在工作中无论何时都不要拒绝小事情，因为大事是由小事积成的。”
    斯大林——今天的列宁。这故事一年，二年，三年也说不尽。今天说到这里，下次再讲斯大林和中国革命。
    惟群讲故事讲的顶起劲，听故事的人也很入神。
