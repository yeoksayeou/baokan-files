From then on, the dirtiest and most barbaric system in the old society no longer exists in the capital of the people. We, the people of Beijing, have begun to grasp our own political power and participate in the construction of the motherland as masters.

Dear representatives, we, the women, workers, farmers, youth, teachers, and students of Beijing, feel great joy and pride that you are meeting in this former imperial palace, today's People's Auditorium. We welcome you, pay tribute to you, and wish the conference success!
