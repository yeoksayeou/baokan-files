Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, December 28th: The Dutch Communist Party Congress held in Amsterdam has concluded. The congress proceeded under the banner of consolidating the unity of the working class, strengthening the struggle for peace, and exposing the war-mongering schemes of the British, American, and Dutch, and extensively discussed the domestic and international situation. The congress denounced the spy and murderer bandit gang of the Tito group and called on the party to increase vigilance.

Groot, the General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, reported at the meeting, stating that the more desperate the situation of the warmongers, the more they intensify preparations for war and incite aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. However, the forces of peace, led by the Soviet Union, are steadily growing, while the reactionaries, led by the American imperialist elements, are suffering repeated defeats. The pro-American policy pursued by the Dutch ruling clique has further deteriorated the situation of the Dutch working people. Prices are soaring, the masses are becoming poorer, and the Marshall Plan has brought the Dutch economy to a dead end. Accompanying war preparations in the Netherlands is the suppression of progressive organizations, especially the Communist Party. The Dutch Communist Party, which courageously fights for peace and the happy future of the working people, educated by the great ideals of the genius leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, is now even stronger. We must unite all forces to oppose the American war instigators and their running dogs.

Groot went on to discuss the situation in Indonesia, stating that despite all the conspiracies of the Dutch and American imperialist elements and their puppet Hatta, the national liberation struggle of the Indonesian people will continue to develop.

The meeting passed resolutions stipulating the further consolidation of the Party and the strengthening of the struggle for peace led by the Soviet Union, and enthusiastically passed a congratulatory telegram celebrating Stalin's birthday.

　　荷共代表大会闭幕
    格鲁特指出荷共已更加强大号召团结力量反对战贩阴谋
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社海牙二十八日讯：在阿姆斯特丹举行的荷兰共产党代表大会业已闭幕。大会在巩固工人阶级团结、加强和平斗争及揭露英、美、荷战争贩子的旗帜下进行，并广泛地讨论了国内和国际形势。大会痛斥铁托集团的间谍和杀人犯匪帮，并号召党内提高警觉性。
    荷共总书记格鲁特在会上作报告称：战争贩子的处境越绝望，便越要加紧准备战争和煽动对苏联及人民民主国家进行侵略，但是现在以苏联为首的和平力量正在稳步增长，而以美帝国主义分子为首的反动派却一次又一次地遭受失败。荷兰统治集团所奉行的亲美政策已使荷兰劳动人民的情况进一步恶化。物价扶摇直上，群众更加贫穷，马歇尔计划已使荷兰经济走到了穷途末路。在荷兰与战争准备并行的便是对进步组织特别是对共产党的镇压。在劳动人民的天才领袖列宁和斯大林的伟大理想教育下，为和平及劳动人民的幸福未来而勇敢战斗的的荷兰共产党，现在已更加强大。我们必须团结一切力量反对美国战争鼓动者及其走狗。
    格鲁特继谈印尼局热称，尽管荷美帝国主义分子及他们的傀儡哈达的一切阴谋，印尼人民的民族解放斗争仍将继续发展。
    会议通过决议，规定一步巩固党及加强苏联领导的和平斗争，并热烈通过庆祝斯大林寿辰的贺电。
