　　Comrade Stalin's Hometown—The Georgian Republic

　　Behind the Caucasus Mountains in southern Soviet Union, on the warm shores of the Black Sea, lies a region rich in natural resources, covered with evergreen and lush vegetation, commonly known as the "Land of Flowers and Fruits." This is the Georgian Republic.

　　Not far from its capital, Tbilisi, is a small town called Gori, which is Stalin's hometown. Stalin's former residence has now been turned into a museum. The small, one-story house is encased in marble and glass to protect it from the cold weather. The interior is preserved as it was during Stalin's childhood.

　　The Georgian Republic covers an area of 69,300 square kilometers. Since the establishment of the Georgian Soviet regime on February 25, 1921, large-scale creative work has begun in every corner of this sun-drenched republic.

　　Georgia has now built more than 800 factories of various kinds, all equipped with the latest machinery. Before the revolution, Georgia had no large hydroelectric power stations, but now it has five large ones and more than 500 small ones. Socialist industrialization has ensured the rapid increase in Georgia's industrial output. Therefore, in 1941, it increased 26 times compared to 1913. The production of silk, tea, wool, and other light and heavy industrial products has increased 26 times.

　　Georgia has large deposits of manganese ore, ranking second in the Soviet Union and the world. This raw material is very much needed for the metallurgical industry. In the new Five-Year Plan, Georgia will refine 430,000 tons of pig iron and 500,000 tons of zinc. The Kutaisi Automobile Factory will produce 30,000 trucks annually. Coal and oil extraction will increase infinitely.

　　In agriculture, output in 1940 increased by 22 percent compared to 1913. The most prominent feature of agricultural development is the rapid expansion of the area under subtropical and industrial plants, including tea, cotton, pulp, and fruits. The increase in these plants has enabled Georgia's agriculture and industry to develop further. Today, there are more than 100 collective farms in Georgia, each with an annual income exceeding one million rubles.

　　Now, there is no illiterate person in Georgia. Under the Soviet regime, 3,000 primary and secondary schools have been established throughout the country. Before the revolution, there was only one advanced institution that only children of the bourgeoisie could attend. Today, it has expanded to 22.

　　In 1946, the republic's budget expenditure on social and cultural undertakings was 1.172 billion rubles, accounting for 68 percent of the total budget.

　　Since the establishment of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, it has cultivated many outstanding scientific talents for Georgia. In the arts, Georgia's literature, opera, and sculpture are also very outstanding, creating many excellent works in these fields.

　　斯大林同志的故乡——乔治亚共和国
    在苏联南部高加索山脉的背后，温暖的黑海之滨，蕴藏着天然丰富的资源，长着长青而繁茂的植物，而有“花果之国”的通称，这就是乔治亚共和国。
    距它的首都梯比利斯不远，一个名叫哥里的小镇子，那就是斯大林的故乡，现在斯大林的故居已变成了博物馆，小小的一层楼的房子为了避免寒冷天气的侵蚀，都用大理石和玻璃装好，里面的陈设仍保持斯大林童年时代所摆的样子。
    乔治亚共和国共有六万九千三百平方公里，自从一九二一年二月二十五日乔治亚苏维埃政权建立以后，为阳光普照下的共和国的每一角落都开始了大规模的创造工作。
    现在乔治亚新建了八百家以上的各种工厂，全部装设最新的机器，革命以前乔治亚没有一座大的水力发电站而现在规模大的已有了五个，小的有五百多个。社会主义的工业化保证了乔治亚工业产量的迅速增加，因此一九四一年比一九一三年增加了二十六倍，丝、茶、毛、及其他轻重工业产品都增加了二十六倍。
    乔治亚有大量的锰矿，占苏联和世界的第二位，这一原料对冶金工业非常需要，在新五年计划内，乔治亚将制炼四十三万吨生铁，五十万吨亚铅，古泰汽车工厂将每年出产三万辆载重汽车，石炭和石油开采量将无限增长。
    在农业方面，一九四○年比一九一三年增加百分之二十二。农业发展中最突出的一个特点是种植亚热带植物及工业植物面积的急剧扩大，这些植物包括茶、棉、浆汁、水果等，由于这些植物的增植，使乔治亚的农业、工业得到更进一步的发展。今天在乔治亚有一百以上的集体农庄，每个单位每年的收入超出一百万卢布以上。
    现在，在乔治亚全国已没有一个文盲，在苏维埃政权下，全国设立了三千个初高级学校，革命前原来只有一个仅有资产阶级子弟可以进去的高级学府，今天已扩充到二十二个。
    在一九四六年共和国预算对社会文化事业的支出为十一亿七千二百万卢布，占全部预算的百分之六十八。
    自从乔治亚科学院成立后，为乔治亚培养出不少杰出科学人才。在艺术方面乔治亚的文学、歌剧、雕刻也是很出色的，在这方面创造出许多优秀的作品。
