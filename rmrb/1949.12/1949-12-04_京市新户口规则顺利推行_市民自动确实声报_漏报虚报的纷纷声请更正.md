　　Beijing's New Household Registration Rules Smoothly Implemented
  　Citizens Automatically and Accurately Register
    Those Who Failed to Report or Made False Declarations Apply for Corrections One After Another
    [Our Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government announced last month the abolishment of the reactionary household registration regulations left over by the Kuomintang bandit gang and began implementing the new household registration rules. The Public Security Bureau immediately actively carried out the work of replacing household registration booklets throughout the city, which was deeply supported by the people of Beijing. It has smoothly completed the preparation and publicity stages and is now filling in household registration booklets door-to-door, which is expected to be completed by the end of the month.
    The purpose of the Municipal People's Government's decision to implement the new household registration rules is to determine the citizenship of citizens, collect household registration statistics, and use them as a basis for building a new Beijing, while further consolidating the revolutionary order of the people's capital. Moreover, the newly revised household registration method has simple procedures. Citizens only need to prepare a household registration booklet, and the Public Security Bureau sends personnel to fill it in door-to-door. In the future, except for migration which requires a migration certificate, other household registration changes will be changed to verbal declarations, which greatly facilitates citizens.
    Before implementation, the government made full preparations. After the Municipal Government issued a public notice on November 6 and announced the rules and penalties for citizens to declare household registration, the Public Security Bureau immediately convened a meeting on establishing a new household registration system on the 12th to discuss specific implementation steps. On the one hand, education was carried out among public security cadres to make everyone understand the significance and importance of establishing a new household registration system; on the other hand, organizational forces were equipped to carry out the work.
    In order to make citizens universally aware of the new household registration system and familiar with the declaration methods, the Public Security Bureau designated last month from the 19th to the 24th as Publicity Week, using various methods to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity to citizens. Each sub-bureau installed loudspeakers at key intersections and wrote blackboards and slogans. Each movie theater also cooperated with the publicity. Each police station also held mass meetings, and almost everyone from more than 400,000 households in the city participated. The Public Security Bureau also dispatched three publicity trucks to carry out street publicity, performing quick report dramas such as "Reporting Household Registration" and "New and Old Police" on the main streets. Many workers, students, government cadres, and citizens also volunteered to assist the Public Security Bureau in carrying out publicity work.
    Due to the in-depth publicity work, citizens realized that the people's government's management of household registration is essentially different from that of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Therefore, they scrambled to purchase household registration booklets and truthfully declared their household registration. Although each police station universally set up agency sales stores, the household registration booklets were still in short supply for a while. Each batch was sold out as soon as it arrived, and more than 400,000 copies were sold in more than ten days. Many citizens voluntarily came to the police station to correct their household registration. For example, in one section of the 13th Police Station of the Fourth Outer Branch Bureau, there were 1 household that had failed to report and made a supplementary report, 4 households that had increased personnel and failed to report and made supplementary reports, 15 households that corrected their occupations, and 7 households that corrected their ages, totaling 27 households. In the past, in order to escape the Kuomintang's conscription, taxation, and restrictions on actions, they concealed their household registration or falsely reported their occupation and age. Now they realize that the new household registration system is beneficial to the people, so they voluntarily request correction. A small number of people who do not understand the meaning of reporting household registration or have listened to rumors from saboteurs still have some concerns, and they are currently being publicized and explained. A very small number of bad elements who are still trying to deceive the government, the broad masses of the people have expressed to the government that they are willing to report. Zhang Dechen, a resident of Changxindian, said: "This reform of household registration will expose all the bad elements, and this time it will be peaceful." The wife of a rickshaw worker in the Second District said: "This method is really good, so that bad people cannot hide, and good people save trouble."
    Currently, each police station of the Public Security Bureau is carrying out the work of filling in household registration booklets door-to-door according to the area. Since the 24th of last month, the Second Outer Branch Bureau has filled in 5,728 households, accounting for 27 percent of the total number of households in the district; the Sixth Inner Branch Bureau has filled in 31 percent, and the Third Outer Branch Bureau has filled in 18 percent. It is estimated that all the filling work will be completed by the end of the month.

### 京市新户口规则顺利推行　市民自动确实声报  漏报虚报的纷纷声请更正

　　京市新户口规则顺利推行
  　市民自动确实声报
    漏报虚报的纷纷声请更正
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府于上月宣布废除国民党匪帮遗留的反动户口规章，开始实行新户口规则，公安局即积极进行更换全市户口簿工作，深获京市人民的拥护，已顺利完成准备和宣传两阶段工作，现正挨户进行填写户口簿，预计月底可全部完成。
    市人民政府此次决定实行新户口规则，其目的是为了确定市民属籍，搜集户口统计资料，以为建设新北京的依据，同时进一步巩固人民首都的革命秩序。而且新订的户口办法，手续简便，市民只须备一本户口簿，公安局派员挨户填写，以后除迁移须一迁移证外，其他户口异动均改为口头声报，予市民极大便利。
    在实行之前，政府作了充分准备，市府于十一月六日发出布告并公布市民声报户口规则与罚则后，公安局即于十二日召开建立新户口制度会议，讨论具体实施步骤，一方面在公安干部中进行了教育，使大家明了建立新户口制度的意义与重要性；一面配备组织力量，以便开展工作。
    为使市民普遍对新户口制度有明确认识，并熟悉声报方法，公安局定上月十九日至二十四日为宣传周，用各种方式向市民进行广泛而深入的宣传。各分局在要路口装置播音器、写黑板报、标语，各电影院也配合着宣传。各派出所并召开了群众大会，全市四十多万户，差不多都有人参加了。公安局更出动了三部宣传卡车进行街头宣传，在各主要街道演出“报户口”、“新旧警察”等快报剧。许多工人、学生、机关干部及市民，亦纷纷自动协助公安局进行宣传工作。
    由于宣传工作的深入，市民认识了人民政府管理户口与国民党反动政府有本质上的不同，因此争先购备户口簿，确实地声报户口。虽然各派出所普设了代售店，户口簿仍一时感到供不应求。各店来一批即被购买一空，十余天中售出了四十余万份。许多市民自动到派出所来更正户口，如外四分局十三派出所一个段内，就有漏户补报一户、增人未报补报的四户、更正职业的十五户、更正年龄的七户，共计二十七户。在过去，他们为了逃避国民党的抽丁、征税、限制行动等，隐瞒了户口或虚报职业年龄，现在他们认识了新的户口制度对于人民是有利的，所以自动请求更正。有少数不明了声报户口意义或听了破坏分子造谣的还有过一些顾虑，现正对他们进行宣传解释。极少数别有用心，仍图欺瞒政府的坏分子，广大群众向政府表示愿意检举。长辛店居民张德臣说：“这次改革户口，把坏分子全都给搜出来，这回可太平了。”二区一个三轮工人的妻子说：“这办法真好，使坏人藏不了，好人省麻烦。”
    现公安局各派出所正按地区进行挨户填写户口簿工作。自上月二十四日开始，数日来外二分局已填完五千七百二十八户，占该区总户数百分之二十七；内六分局已填完百分之三十一，外三分局已填完百分之十八，预计全部填写工作月底可完成。
