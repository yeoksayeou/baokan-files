　　The so-called Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference, directed by US State Department representative Cochran and his advisors, was convened in The Hague on August 23, 1949, and ended on November 2. It lasted for seventy-two days. The Dutch side attending the meeting was represented by the colonial minister Maarseveen, the big plantation owners, bankers, and senior officials. The Hatta delegation consisted of members of the opposing feudal families. The composition of the participants clearly tells the world that this was an auction transaction by an imperialist group and its running dogs. The results of the meeting proved this: The Hatta reactionary group signed various traitorous agreements: It passed the Dutch-Indonesian Federal Organizational Law led by the Queen of the Netherlands. The Netherlands actually represents the "United States of Indonesia" in diplomatic relations. All Dutch colonial institutions in Batavia and other cities in Indonesia are ostensibly transferred to the government institutions of the "United States of Indonesia". In reality, the administration of the Dutch colony still exists within the "United States of Indonesia" as before. The Hatta reactionary group also shamelessly accepted the stationing of a Dutch military delegation in Indonesia to help establish and train the anti-people Indonesian army. Starting from November 1, Dutch imperialism aided with sixty guilders per month to arm the anti-people "Republican Army" to slaughter the Indonesian people. Under the pretext that "the security of Indonesian waters is maintained by the Dutch Navy," it further controlled Indonesian military and defense. Moreover, under the instigation of the United States, Hatta agreed that the government of the "United States of Indonesia" would use 4.5 billion guilders of the Indonesian people's blood and sweat to repay part of the debt owed to Dutch imperialism and part of the post-war debt. It also handed over the power to decide all of Indonesia's economic and fiscal policies to Dutch imperialist control.

　　The conspiratorial purpose of the agreements concluded at the "Round Table Conference" is obvious. US imperialism hopes to use the "Round Table Conference" in The Hague to drag its running dog Hatta and his followers into the Southeast Asian military bloc led by Washington, and at the same time get involved in Indonesia's extremely rich natural resources and oil mines. The "Pacific Oil Company's" acquisition of special privileges on the Riau Islands (located between Sumatra and Singapore, with an area of 381,000 hectares) is a good proof. The managers of this company are Dutch, but its shares all belong to the American Mobil Oil Company and the Texas Company. Not only that, US imperialism is further Marshallizing Indonesia. In the second year of the Marshall Plan, US$39.2 million was allocated to Indonesia, thus giving US imperialism the right to establish naval bases in the ports of Surabaya and Java. Dutch imperialism is trying to preserve its colonial system and colonial rule in Indonesia. The Hatta reactionary group's auction has aroused widespread anger among the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people want to go their own way. The people's guerrillas active in Java and Sumatra are actively mobilizing, attacking Dutch colonists, destroying transportation, and dealing heavy blows to the Dutch army. Even some of the troops controlled by the Sukarno-Hatta puppet government are unwilling to follow the traitors on the road to destruction. Part of the "Indonesian Republic" army in West Java has refused to execute Hatta's orders. A brigade of the "Republican Army" in East Java has notified the "Indonesian Republic government" that it is no longer bound by the "ceasefire order" to oppose the enslaving agreements of the Hague "Round Table Conference."

### 海牙“圆桌会议”

　　海牙“圆桌会议”
    由美国国务院代表柯契伦及其顾问指挥下的所谓荷印圆桌会议于一九四九年八月二十三日召开于海牙，十一月二日结束。前后历时七十二天。荷兰方面出席会议的是以殖民部长马尔西文为首的大种植园主、银行家、与高级官员的代表们。哈达代表团则是反对的封建家族的人员。从参加会议的成分看来，清楚地告诉世界人民：这是一个帝国主义集团及其走狗的拍卖交易。从会议的结果便得到了证明：哈达反动集团签订了各项卖国协定：通过了由荷兰女王领导的荷印联邦组织法，荷兰在外交关系上，实际上代表“印尼合众国”。在巴达维亚及印尼其他城市的全部荷兰殖民机构，表面上移交给“印尼合众国”的政府机构，实际上荷兰殖民地的行政仍然象从前一样地存在于“印尼合众国”内，哈达反动集团还无耻接受了荷兰派遣军事代表团驻在印尼，帮助建立与训练印尼反人民军队。并自十一月一日起荷帝国主义每月以六十盾之助，武装反人民的“共和军”屠杀印尼人民。复以“印尼水上的安全由荷兰海军来维持”为词，进一步控制印尼军事及国防。并且哈达在美国的指使下，同意“印尼合众国”政府以四十五亿盾之巨的印尼人民血汗来偿付荷帝国主义所负的一部债务及战后的一部债务。又把印尼的全部经济与财政政策决定权送给荷帝控制。
    “圆桌会议”所缔结的协定，其阴谋目的很明显，美帝国主义希望借海牙的“圆桌会议”把其走狗哈达和他的喽罗拉入在华盛顿领导之下的东南亚军事集团，同时并染指印尼极端丰富的天然资源油矿。“太平洋石油公司”已取得瑞渥群岛（位于苏门答腊与新加坡之间，面积三十八万一千公顷）上的特权就是很好的证明。这个公司的经理们是些荷兰人，但它的股票都属于美国的美孚石油公司及得克萨斯公司。不仅如此，美帝国主义正在使印尼进一步马歇尔计划化。马歇尔计划第二年经费中，拨给印尼的计三千九百二十万美元，美帝国主义因此就有权在泗水爪哇的港口建立海军基地。荷兰帝国主义则力图保存它在印尼的殖民制度及殖民统治。哈达反动集团的拍卖行为已引起印尼人民的普遍愤怒。印尼人民要走他们自己的路。在爪哇与苏门答腊活动的人民游击队积极出动，袭击荷兰殖民者，破坏交通，予荷兰军队以重大打击。甚至苏加诺、哈达傀儡政府控制下的一部分军队也不愿跟着卖国贼向着灭亡的路上走，西爪哇部分“印尼共和国”的军队，已拒绝执行哈达的命令，东爪哇的“共和军”一个旅已通知“印尼共和国政府”它不再受“停战令”的约束，以反对海牙“圆桌会议”的奴役协定。
