　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government is currently taking the following two measures regarding the management of coal mines in the Mentougou district of western Beijing: On the one hand, under the principle of considering both public and private interests, it is vigorously supporting legitimate private coal pits in the western part of the district to increase production; on the other hand, it is sealing off all private coal pits in the eastern part of the district that illegally encroach on state-owned mining areas, in order to protect state resources and the interests of public mines.
    Regarding supporting private small pits: First, the state-owned Jingxi Coal Mining Company will install three 50-horsepower water pumps to drain water for the small pits in Quanmenli in the west. It is estimated that the water will be pumped out in 50 days, with drainage costs requiring 50,000 catties of millet per day, which the small pits can repay in installments. As a result of the drainage, the current daily output of the western small pits has reached 2,800 tons, and it is expected to reach around 4,000 tons by the end of December. Second, loans are provided by the National Bank, totaling 51.06 million yuan loaned to three private machine-operated pits in June, equivalent to 1,343,410 catties of millet at the then market price, and 43.9 million yuan loaned to nineteen small pits from September to November. Third, coal is approved or pre-purchased by the Coal and Iron Company, which can enable the pits to circulate funds and reduce exploitation by coal merchants. As for the private coal pits in the eastern part of the district that encroached on the state-owned mining areas, since May of this year, thirteen have been completely sealed off, four have been partially sealed off, and twenty-four have been persuaded to suspend work or withdraw. One hundred and twenty-four pits were suspended after flooding and were not allowed to resume work. These small pits generally consume back coal and do not leave coal pillars, which not only endangers the safety of workers but also seriously affects the future development of national mineral resources. During the rainy season this year, the state-owned Mentougou Mine was flooded due to rainwater flowing in from the aforementioned sealed small pits, which caused the mine to suspend mining for a month from mid-August to mid-September. Production dropped from 36,000 tons per month (the average production figure from February to June this year) to 2,354 tons in August, and it will not be able to resume normal production until August next year. Furthermore, the state-owned Chengzi Mine has also suffered losses due to water leakage from the private coal pits at the bottom of the Northwest Gully. In severe cases, such as the private Fuli Coal Pit, the tunnels of the Chengzi Mine were dug through, forcing Chengzi Mine to spend 120,000 catties of millet to block the tunnels. This year, Chengzi Mine spent a total of 447,536 catties of millet before and after June to fill private tunnels and build waterproof walls. The private pits encroaching on the state-owned mining areas are shallow due to their use of indigenous mining methods, all being above the tunnels of the state-owned mines. When encountering water, it seeps into the tunnels of Chengzi Mine. Therefore, some private pits with drainage equipment have also abandoned them, relying on Chengzi Mine's drainage to mine coal themselves. In another situation, after private pits have mined the upper coal seam, they leave large ponds of accumulated water, some reaching depths of more than 20 zhang, which affects the mechanized mining of the state-owned mines. For example, the reservoir of the private Mo Hong Pit is above the main tunnel of Chengzi Mine, making Chengzi Mine afraid to mine there. The East Main Tunnel project of Chengzi Mine has only advanced more than ten meters in three months. According to estimates by engineers from Jingxi Coal Mining Company, the lifespan of Mentougou Mine will be reduced by at least ten years due to the indiscriminate mining by private pits. In addition, some private pits have collapsed the dormitories of Mentougou Mine workers, some have dug into the mine factory of Chengzi Mine, and some are only digging 20 meters above the tunnels of Chengzi Mine. Even worse, private pits such as Lisheng have dug through the tunnels of Chengzi Mine and stolen state-owned coal. After being discovered, not only did they not stop this illegal destructive behavior, but they continued to mine the remaining coal pillars until they were exhausted. The result of this illegal and indiscriminate mining not only damages the mine but also easily causes huge casualties to miners if it collapses, which must be stopped. As early as January of this year, the former North China People's Government issued the "Order Prohibiting the Continued Opening of Small Pits in Major Mining Areas." In mid-September, the Municipal Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) for the Management of Coal Mining in Jingxi," stipulating that "in mining areas that have been exploited, the government may at any time take back mining rights and stop mining when necessary, and purchase part or all of its equipment according to the specific situation." In order to implement government decrees and protect state resources, the Jingxi Mining Affairs Office of the Beijing Municipal Government has successively sealed off private pits that endanger public mines. The real estate and equipment of more than 30 of these private pits have been purchased by Jingxi Coal Mining Company at a price. Recently, it has been discovered that some sealed private pits are illegally mining behind closed doors during the day and secretly transporting coal at night. The Jingxi Mining Affairs Office has investigated and dealt with many such illegal acts, and the government is currently investigating.

　　鼓励门头沟私营煤窑正当开采
  　京市政府贷款九千余万
    若干小窑非法开采已被封闭
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府对京西门头沟区煤矿的管理刻正采取下列两个措施：一方面在公私兼顾的原则下大力扶植该区西部的合法私营煤窑，增加生产；一方面查封该区东部非法侵入公营矿区的全部私营煤窑，以保障国家资源和公矿利益。
    关于扶植私营小窑：第一、由公营京西煤矿公司装置五十马力水泵三台，代西部圈门里各小窑排水，预计五十天抽完，排水费日需小米五万斤，各小窑可陆续分期偿还。由于排水结果，现西部各小窑日产量已达二千八百吨，预计十二月底可达四千吨左右。第二、由国家银行贷款，计六月份贷给三家私营机器窑共五千一百零六万元，按当时牌价折合小米一百三十四万三千四百一十斤，九月至十一月贷给十九家小窑共四千三百九十万元。第三、由煤铁公司批煤或预购，这样可使各窑资金周转，并减少煤商剥削。至于该区东部侵入公营矿区的各私营煤窑，从本年五月迄今，被全部查封者十三家，部分查封者四家，经说服停工或退出者二十四家。因淹窑自行停工后不准复工者一百二十四家。这些小窑一般是滥吃回煤、不留煤柱，不仅危及工人安全，且严重影响了国家矿山资源发展的前途。在今年雨季，公营门头沟矿被淹，即因雨水自上述被封小窑流入所致，使该矿自八月中旬至九月中旬停采一个月，产量自每月三万六千吨（今年二月至六月平均产量数字）降低至八月的二千三百五十四吨，须到明年八月始能恢复正常产量。又：公营城子矿，亦因西北沟底各私营煤窑漏水侵入而遭受损失，情形严重的如私营福利煤窑，竟将城矿巷道挖通，致使城矿不得不花费小米十二万斤，用于堵塞透洞，今年城矿为填塞私窑透洞及建防水墙工程，至六月止前后共用小米四十四万七千五百三十六斤。侵入公矿区的各私窑因系土法开采，入地很浅，均在公矿巷道之上，遇水即渗入城矿巷道，因此一些本有排水设备的私窑亦均撤而不用，靠着城矿排水自己吃煤。还有一种情形，私窑采完上部煤层，留下大塘积水，有深达二十余丈者，影响了公矿机采的进行。如私营模宏窑水塘在城矿大巷道上，使城矿不敢在该处采煤，城矿东大巷工程，三个月只掘进十余公尺。据京西煤矿公司工程师的估计，因私窑滥采，门矿寿命至少减少十年。此外，各私窑有的挖塌了门矿工人宿舍，有的挖入城矿矿厂下，有的仅在城矿巷道二十米上挖，更甚者如利生等私窑竟挖通城矿巷道，偷吃公煤，经查获后，不但不停止此种不法的破坏行为，反而一直继续挖完剩余煤柱方止。此种违法滥采的结果，不止损害矿山，而且一旦坍塌，极易造成矿工的巨大伤亡，必须加以制止。早在今年一月间，前华北人民政府曾颁布“禁止在各大矿区续开小窑令”，九月中，市政府颁布“京西煤矿业开采管理暂行条例（草案）”，规定“已开采之矿区，必要时政府得随时收回矿权停止开采，并按具体情况，征购其设备之一部或全部”。京市府京西矿务处为了执行政府法令，保护国家资源，遂将危害公矿之各私窑先后查封，其中三十余家私窑的房产、器材，已由京西煤矿公司价购。最近发现尚有被查封私窑白昼闭门私采，夜间偷运等违法行为，已经京西矿务处查获多起，现正由政府查办中。
