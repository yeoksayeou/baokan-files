　　North China Oil Company
  　Massively Purchases Peanuts
    [Beijing News] In order to facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and develop foreign trade, the Beijing branch of the North China Oil Company has decided to purchase a large quantity of peanuts and organize processing for export. Since November, the company has been cooperating with the government in levying agricultural taxes in kind, and in conjunction with cooperatives in various counties and villages, has been purchasing peanuts on a large scale. It plans to purchase 7 million catties of peanut kernels by the end of December, of which 40% will be exported, and the remainder will be processed into oil for export. In order to take care of the interests of farmers, the company's purchase price is relatively high. Generally, one catty of peanuts is exchanged for one catty and three taels of millet according to market prices, but the company's purchase ratio is at least one catty and twelve taels of millet, and at most two catties. In order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the company also transported 23,400 catties of kerosene to farmers in Tong County.
    In addition, the company is in contact with Beijing oil pressing factories and workshops to have them process the oil.
