    Section 3: The Class Nature, Partisan Nature, and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy

    The experience of world history up to the 1950s tells us that not only must the proletariats of capitalist countries unite, but the proletariats and people of various colonial and semi-colonial countries must also unite with the international proletariat. In particular, whether it is the proletariat and people of capitalist countries or the proletariat and people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, they must first unite with the socialist state of the Soviet Union and the Soviet working class, with the new democratic countries and the working class and people in the new democratic countries, politically and economically, spiritually and materially, supporting each other, in friendship and cooperation, in order to defeat their common enemy—the exploitation and rule of international imperialism, first of all, defeating the international imperialist camp headed by the United States and its plans and war conspiracies to enslave the world and exploit humanity. After the revolution has achieved victory in a country, during the period of socialist or new democratic construction, this kind of international joint action, mutual support, and friendly cooperation is not only still necessary but should be further strengthened and expanded more broadly and comprehensively. If any country does not have the friendly assistance of the international proletariat and the working class headed by the Soviet Union in the revolution, its victory is unimaginable. If any country does not have the extensive material, economic, technological, scientific, cultural, theoretical, and experiential assistance of the Soviet socialist state and the working class, as well as the assistance of the international proletariat after the victory of the revolution, it is impossible to build a new democratic society or transition from new democracy to socialism.

    This international solidarity and international union of the international working class must be united and acted upon under the viewpoint and principles of Marxist-Leninist internationalism. And this Marxist-Leninist internationalism is consistent with and combined with the proletariat's true patriotism. The experience of the world revolution has fully proved that only thorough internationalists are true patriots. In particular, the experience of the Chinese revolution proves this even more profoundly. If in the past twenty years, China had not obtained the assistance of the international proletariat and the working class, especially the Soviet Union and the Soviet working class, in various aspects, the Chinese revolution could not have achieved today's victory. Therefore, in the long years of China's new democratic construction in the future, we should especially cherish this experience, promote this experience, in order to protect the interests of the Chinese working class and the masses of the people and the fruits of their hard-won victory, in order to eliminate the remaining enemies, in order to carry out various victorious political and economic struggles with international imperialism, in order to restore and develop production, in order to lead China from the level of a backward agricultural country to the level of a modern and advanced industrial country, for the permanent independence, freedom, peace, and happiness of the Chinese people, in order to achieve a new democratic society and gradually transition to socialism, we must first resolutely unite with and rely on the great socialist motherland—the Soviet Union and its working class, and obtain their wider and more comprehensive assistance, and unite and unite with the proletariat and people of capitalist countries, unite and unite with the proletariat and people of all oppressed nations. Only this internationalist united force and the power it demonstrates is an irresistible and invincible force, and it is the decisive factor in defeating and overthrowing international imperialism and its running dogs and their united forces.

    The Internationalism of Political Economy is the Foundation and Guarantee of the International Union of the Proletariat

    The internationalism of Marxist-Leninist political economy, on the one hand, is a reflection of the sacred interests of the international proletariat uniting in the face of international capitalist economic oppression, and at the same time, it is the ideological and theoretical foundation and guarantee for establishing and consolidating the international union and international solidarity of the proletariat in various countries. Because as early as Marx and Engels said, "National isolation and antagonism between peoples are vanishing gradually from day to day, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto," and "The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster." (Marx and Engels, The Communist Manifesto)

    The Bourgeoisie's Selfish Class Nature Determines the Bourgeois Political Economy's Narrow Class Nature

    All bourgeoisie (those who occupy a ruling and managing position politically and economically, and historically) have always been extraordinarily concerned and extraordinarily sensitive to their own class interests, especially their own economic interests. Therefore, any infringement of their class interests, especially economic interests, is not allowed and is considered "sacred and inviolable."

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    迄至目前二十世纪五十年代，世界历史发展的经验告诉我们，不但资本主义各国的无产阶级必须联合起来，而且各个殖民地半殖民地国家的无产阶级与人民大众也必须与国际无产阶级联合起来。特别是不论资本主义各国的无产阶级与人民大众和殖民地半殖民地各国无产阶级与人民大众，都首先必须与社会主义的国家苏联及苏联的工人阶级，与新民主主义各国及新民主各国内的工人阶级与人民大众，在政治上与经济上，在精神上与物质上联合起来，相互支援，友谊合作，才能战胜它们共同的敌人——国际帝国主义的剥削统治，首先是战胜以美国为首的国际帝国主义阵营及其奴役世界剥削人类奴役人类的计划与战争阴谋。当革命在一国内取得胜利以后，进行社会主义或新民主主义建设时期，这种国际的联合行动、相互支援、友谊合作，不但仍然必要，而且应当更加加强，更加广泛更加全面地展开。任何一个国家，如果在革命中没有以苏联为首的国际无产阶级与工人阶级的友谊援助，其胜利是不可想象的。任何一个国家如果在革命胜利后没有苏联社会主义国家与工人阶级物质上、经济、技术上、科学文化上、理论经验上，广泛的援助及国际无产阶级的援助，要建成一个新民主主义社会，或由新民主主义过渡到社会主义去，是不可能的。
    国际工人阶级的这一国际团结与国际联合乃是必须在马列主义国际主义的观点原则下联合行动起来的。而这种马列主义的国际主义，又是与无产阶级真正的爱国主义相一致，相结合着的。世界革命的经验已经完全证明，只有彻底的国际主义者，才是真正的爱国主义者。特别是中国革命的经验更加深刻地证明着。如果在过去二十余年中没有或得不到国际无产阶级与工人阶级，特别是苏联与苏联工人阶级各方面的援助，中国革命是不可能得到今天的胜利的。所以在今后中国新民主主义建设的长期岁月里，尤其应当珍贵这一经验，发扬这一经验，为了保护中国工人阶级与人民大众的利益和他们艰难获得的胜利果实，为了肃清残余的敌人，为了与国际帝国主义进行政治的与经济的各种胜利的斗争，为了恢复与发展生产，为了把中国从落后的农业国水平引到近代先进的工业国水平，为了中国人民永久的独立自由和平与幸福，为了达成新民主主义社会并逐步过渡到社会主义去，首先必须坚决地联合与依靠伟大的社会主义祖国——苏联和他的工人阶级，并取得他们更广泛更全面的援助，并联合与团结资本主义各国无产阶级及人民大众，联合与团结各被压迫民族的无产阶级与人民大众，只有这种国际主义的团结力量和它所表现出来的力量，才是不可抗拒不可战胜的力量，才是战胜与打倒国际帝国主义及其走狗和它们的联合力量的决定因素。
    政治经济学的国际性是无产阶级的国际联合的基础与保证
    马列主义政治经济学的国际性，一方面是在国际资本主义经济压迫下国际间无产阶级团结一致神圣利益的反映，同时又是树立与巩固各国无产阶级国际联合与国际团结的思想上与理论上的基础与保证。因为早如马克思恩格斯所说的“各人民间底民族孤立性和对立性已经随着资产阶级的发展，随着贸易自由与世界市场，随着工业生产以及与之相适应的生活状况底一致化，而日益消失”，并且“无产阶级的统治，将更加加速其消失”。（马克思恩格斯合著共产党宣言）
    资产阶级自私自利的阶级本性决定资产阶级政治经济学偏狭的阶级性
    一切资产阶级（在政治上经济上占有统治管理地位与历史的）对于他们自己的阶级利害，首先是对于自己的经济利害向来都是异常关心与异常敏感的。因此对于他们的阶级利益，首先是经济利益的任何触犯，都是不能容许，而被认为“神圣不可侵犯”的。
