Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 7th: London dispatch: The Anglo-Chinese Conference, which opened on the 3rd, successfully concluded on the 4th. At the meeting on the 4th, many prominent trade union leaders, social figures, and cultural workers continued to speak, expressing their support for the new China of the people and for the formation of a new association friendly to the Chinese people.

　　Crawford, representing the Manchester District Amalgamated Engineering Union Committee, declared that the working people guarantee not to repeat in China the destructive work that British foremen did to the Soviet Union.

　　After Agnes Smedley, the famous writer on Chinese affairs, introduced the thrilling difficulties experienced and the extraordinary achievements made by the People's Liberation Army, the entire venue stood in silent tribute to commemorate those who sacrificed themselves to enable the founding of the People's Republic of China.

　　Montagu of the British Peace Committee declared: China's victory has changed the balance of power in the world. The Soviet Union, China, and Britain together can make "it impossible for anyone to launch a war."

　　Labour Party Peer Lord Strabolgi pointed out: China's liberation will historically become the second major event of this century, the first being the Russian Revolution. He declared amidst applause: I only hope that we will not repeat the mistakes we made with the new Russia with the new China. The interests of the British people and the Chinese people are the same.

　　Independent Member of Parliament Platts-Mills put forward a motion to the meeting, requesting the meeting to urge: (1) immediate recognition of the government of the People's Republic of China; (2) trade with China. He said to applause, "If those forces that urge recognition of China can succeed in the coming weeks (I dare to say they can), we will be seven years faster than recognizing the Soviet Union." The demand to conduct trade will also be successful, "because everyone who understands the stakes is united around this demand." He recalled that Hong Kong was acquired by Britain "in an era when Britain could plunder at will." As a lawyer, he should point out that an agreement agreed to under duress should be considered invalid from the outset.

　　Crawford then put forward a motion to establish the "Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association" to "unite all individuals and groups seeking friendship with China in a permanent organization."

　　Many representatives stood up to speak, warmly supporting the motions of Platts-Mills and Crawford.

　　The meeting successfully concluded after unanimously passing the above two motions.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 6th: The Anglo-Chinese Conference held at Beaver Hall in London was a mass meeting convened by British progressives to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Britain. Trade union leaders, professors, doctors, members of parliament, housewives, co-operators, factory workers, and students attending the meeting spoke one after another, demanding that the British government immediately establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China "on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty."

　　L. Randall, a young trade union worker representing the Ludden Trade Union Committee, reminded British workers of the failure of the intervention war against the young Soviet Republic, which Churchill had instigated in the past. He said: "The youth in the labor movement today are ready to participate in the parallel movement to support the new Chinese regime. The Chinese wall built by Wall Street with Bevin's help must be swept away."

　　Dribben, Secretary of the Anglo-Chinese Conference Committee, said that the organizers and sponsors, including well-known figures from all walks of life, were encouraged by three main reasons: (1) "We recognize that a new, democratic country has been born," (2) "The issue of maintaining world peace unites us," and (3) "We have unprecedented opportunities to expand trade in China, and China is willing to trade and be friendly with us."

　　White, General Secretary of the Civil Service Union, spoke in a personal capacity, saying: "China's great development gives us an opportunity to reaffirm independence and get rid of foreign enslavement. The diplomacy we pursue in the future must provide the British people with the maximum guarantee of avoiding war." He argued that the British government should issue such a declaration: "For the benefit of the British people, we intend to wholeheartedly and unconditionally recognize the new China." He said amidst laughter: "You can't continue to recognize Chiang Kai-shek, because in a day or two, you won't know where to find him."

　　Former naval officer Young described the Amethyst incident as "a provocative, extremely absurd, and most unfortunate thing for the Royal Navy."

　　Dudley, Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain, declared: "We unanimously support the demand for immediate recognition of the People's Republic of China without waiting for anyone's permission," and this recognition must be based on "equality, sovereignty, and territorial integrity." Britain should change the provocative military measures taken in Hong Kong and actively negotiate to return Hong Kong to China. His speech was warmly welcomed.

　　The introductions of the new China by journalists Alan Winnington and Dr. E. Tuckman aroused heated discussions. Dr. Tuckman introduced his experience working with the Friends Service Unit. He faithfully described the huge disparity between the Kuomintang areas and the liberated areas. In the Kuomintang countryside, "there is no trace of democracy," only poverty and terrible diseases. Beating people and conscripting laborers are commonplace. "The US government has spent millions of dollars for this regime." But in the liberated areas, there is extensive land reform, competition campaigns, industrial collective contracts, militias, universal education, and medical services.

　　Winnington's speech was frequently applauded. He said: "The Chinese revolution has triumphed. The People's Republic of China is immortal. There is no single or united force in the world that can destroy what the people have built together in unity. The new China is determined to raise the industrial level from the current 10% to over 40% within fifteen to twenty years. Judging from what I have seen, they will succeed within twelve to fifteen years."

　　Mrs. M. Keith, representative of the British Democratic Women's Federation, pointed out: "Just the supply of Chinese eggs will win the support of most housewives. I went to the grocery store today and there were no eggs at all, not even Marshall Aid eggs!"

　　The Anglo-Chinese Conference received many congratulatory telegrams from all over Britain, including those from the Newcastle and Manchester Trade Union Committees. Newcastle's telegram urged "for the sake of world peace" to immediately establish diplomatic relations with the new China and "resume trade as soon as possible."

　　英中会议胜利闭幕
  　一致决议成立英中友好协会
    团结一切与中国友好的力量
    【新华社布拉格七日电】伦敦消息：三日开幕的英中会议已于四日胜利闭幕。在四日的会议上，许多著名的工会领袖、社会名流和文化工作者继续发言，他们表示支持人民的新中国，支持组成一个与中国人民友好的新协会。
    代表曼澈斯特区混合机器工会委员会的克劳福宣称，劳动人民保证不会在中国重复英国工头们对苏联所作的破坏工作。
    在著名的中国问题作家史沫特莱介绍了人民解放军所经历过的惊心动魄的艰难和所获致的非凡的成就以后，会场全体肃立静默，纪念那些牺牲了自己而使中华人民共和国得以成立的人们。
    英国和平委员会的蒙塔格宣称：中国的胜利改变了世界的力量对比。苏联、中国与英国一起，能够使“任何人都不可能发动战争”。
    工党上议员斯特拉波尔基指出：中国的解放在历史上将成为本世纪的第二件大事，第一件大事是俄国革命。他在掌声中宣称：我只希望我们对新中国不要重犯我们对新俄国所犯的那样的错误。英国人民和中国人民的利益是同一的。
    独立的国会议员普拉茨——米尔斯向会议提出一项动议，要求会议力促：（一）立即承认中华人民共和国政府；（二）与中国进行贸易。他在鼓掌声中说：“如果那些力促承认中国的力量能够在今后数周内成功（我敢大胆地说他们能够），我们就会比承认苏联快七年。”进行贸易的要求也将获得成功，“因为一切懂得利害的人们都团结在这一要求周围”。他回忆称，香港是“当英国能够任意掠夺的时代”由英国取得的。作为一个律师，他应该指出，在压力之下所同意的协定，从一开始起，就应该被认为无效。
    克劳福继之提出动议，建议成立“英中友好协会”，“把一切寻求与中国友好的个人和团体团结在一个永久性的组织里面”。
    许多代表起立发言，热烈拥护普拉茨——米尔斯和克劳福的动议。
    会议在一致通过上述二项动议之后胜利闭幕。
    【新华社布拉格六日电】在伦敦贝佛尔厅举行的英中会议，是英国进步人士为促进中英两国人民友谊而召开的一次群众性会议。出席会议的工会领袖、教授、医生、国会议员、主妇、合作社员、工厂工人和学生，一个一个相继发言，要求英国政府立即在“平等、互利及相互尊重领土完整和主权的基础上”，与中华人民共和国建立外交关系。
    代表鲁登工会委员会的年青的职工会工作者Ｌ·兰道尔，他向英国工人提起过去邱吉尔所鼓动起来的反对年青的苏维埃共和国的干涉战争的失败。他说：“劳工运动中的青年人今天准备参加支持中国新政权的并行运动。华尔街在贝文帮助下建立起来的一道中国假墙，必须加以扫除。”
    英中会议委员会秘书德里本说，包括社会各界知名人士的组织者和赞助人，为三种主要的原因所鼓励：（一）“我们认识到一个新的、民主的国家已经诞生”，（二）“保持世界和平这个问题使我们结合在一起”，（三）“我们在中国有着扩展贸易的空前机会，中国愿与我们贸易和友好”。
    公务员联合会总书记怀特，以个人地位发言称：“中国的巨大发展给我们以重申独立和摆脱外来奴役的机会。今后我们所进行的外交，要使英国人民得到避免战争的最大限度的保障。”他主张英国政府应该发表这样的宣言：“为了英国人民的利益，我们打算全心全意地和毫无条件地承认新中国。”他在笑声中说道：“你无法继续承认蒋介石，因为过一两天，你就不知道到那里可以找到他。”
    前海军军官杨氏描述紫石英事件是“皇家海军具有挑拨性的、极端荒谬的和最不幸的事情。”
    英国共产党副主席杜德宣称：“我们一致支持立即承认中华人民共和国而不等待任何人的允许的要求。”，而这个承认必须基于“平等、主权和领土的完整”。英国应改变在香港所采取的挑衅性军事措施，而主动地进行谈判，将香港归还中国。他的发言博得了热烈的欢迎。
    记者阿兰·魏宁顿和Ｅ·突克曼博士关于新中国的介绍，引起了大家热烈的讨论。突克曼博士介绍了和公谊服务队在一起工作的经验。他忠实地描述了国民党地区与解放区之间的巨大悬殊。在国民党的乡村里，“看不到一点民主的痕迹”，只有贫贱和可怖的疾病。打人和拉夫，司空见惯。“美国政府化了千百万美元，为的就是这个政权”。但在解放区，却有着广泛的土地改革，有竞赛运动，工业集体合同，民兵，普及教育和医疗服务。
    魏宁顿的演说频频博得掌声。他说：“中国革命胜利了。中华人民共和国永生不灭。世界上没有任何一个或联合的力量，能够摧毁人民团结一致建立起来的东西。新中国决心于十五年到二十年的期间，把工业水平自目前的百分之十，提高到百分之四十以上。就我所见来判断，他们在十二年到十五年之内就会成功。”
    英国民主妇女联合会代表Ｍ·凯丝夫人指出：“仅仅是中国的鸡蛋的供给，就会取得大多数主妇的支持。我今天到食品店去，那里没有任何的蛋，连马歇尔援助的蛋都没有！”
    英中会议收到英国各地来的不少贺电，其中包括新堡和曼澈斯特工会委员会的。新堡的贺电敦促“为着世界和平的利益”，立即与新中国建立外交关系，并“早日恢复贸易”。
