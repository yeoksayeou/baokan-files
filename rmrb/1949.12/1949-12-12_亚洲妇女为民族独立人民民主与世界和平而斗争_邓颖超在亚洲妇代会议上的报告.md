　　Asian Women Fight for National Independence, People's Democracy, and World Peace
    Deng Yingchao's Report at the Asian Women's Congress
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th】Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a report today at the Asian Women's Representative Conference entitled "Asian Women's Struggle for National Independence, People's Democracy, and World Peace." The full text is as follows: Dear Sisters:
    I feel extremely honored to be able to deliver this report to you today on the struggle of Asian women for national independence, people's democracy, and world peace.
    This first historical Asian Women's Representative Conference convened by the Women's International Democratic Federation in Beijing, China, is of extraordinary and far-reaching significance. Beijing is the cultural center of China throughout the dynasties. Here, we can appreciate the infinitely rich treasure of Chinese culture. The holding of this conference in Beijing cannot but remind us of the long and splendid cultures of China and other Asian nations, thereby generating boundless national self-confidence. Beijing is also the capital of the new People's Republic of China, symbolizing not only the great transformation of the Chinese people but also the development of the struggle of all oppressed nations in Asia to a new stage. Therefore, the holding of this conference in Beijing cannot but make us rejoice and fill us with confidence in the victory of the liberation struggle of our oppressed Asian nations and oppressed women.
    I. Asian Nations are Nations with a Long Cultural History
    The various Asian nations are nations with a long cultural history. For example, China, its recorded history already spans five thousand years. Gunpowder, the compass, paper, and printing – these several inventions that have made significant contributions to the world's culture all originated in China. China's history has produced many great thinkers and outstanding writers. Several distinctive labor products of the Chinese people – porcelain, embroidery, jade and ivory carvings, and lacquerware, etc. – their exquisiteness is rarely matched anywhere in the world. Again, India, it already had a high level of culture in the third millennium BC. The achievements of the Indian people in philosophy and literature are significant. Its medicine, agronomy, and mathematics all once reached a high level. For many centuries, the Middle East has been the center of Islamic culture in the world. The history of Iran is already three thousand years old. The Iranian epic is world-renowned. Other Asian nations also have their own important contributions to world civilization.
    The lands of Asian countries are vast and rich, accounting for one-third of the world's total land area. Agricultural crops and other animal and plant resources are very abundant.
    Asia has a large population, accounting for more than half of the world's total population. Our people are known for their diligence and hard work, and they are intelligent and creative.
    Dear Sisters! With such a rich cultural heritage and natural resources, coupled with the diligent labor of our people, we originally had full possibilities to create prosperous, civilized, and happy lives for ourselves and our children. However, the feudal system of thousands of years has bound the development of our productive forces, and the imperialist colonial system of centuries has drained our blood. The wealth created by the vast majority of our people with their own labor has been mostly plundered by those few bloodsucking oppressors and exploiters – primarily the imperialist robbers – and our laboring people themselves are plunged into extreme poverty and hunger.
    If anyone ridicules the people of Asia as backward (the so-called "Asiatic" in English carries the meaning of primitive and backward), then we can tell them with perfect confidence: if the people of the various Asian nations with their long and highly developed cultures have lagged behind in modern times, then this lagging behind is entirely the result of the cruel oppression, excessive exploitation, and obscurantist policies of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries. What we are proud of is precisely that our people have never been willing to lag behind, and have never been willing to be slaves. We not only cherish the ancient culture of our nations, but we also want to create new civilization and happiness, and contribute them to all mankind. To achieve this goal, we must first break free from the shackles imposed on us by the imperialist robbers; and that is precisely what we have done. For centuries, from our ancestors to us, we have waged unyielding struggles to oppose imperialist aggressors and their running dogs within our own countries. Today, this struggle has blossomed brilliantly and borne the fruit of victory. Our glorious sisters in the Soviet Central Asian republics are the best example. The women in the People's Republics of China, Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam are also concrete proofs of the fruits of victory reaped in this struggle.
    II. Imperialist Robbers Have Turned Asia into a Prison for All Nations
    Now let us first take a look at how the imperialist robbers have transformed our beautiful and wealthy homeland of the Asian people into a poor and miserable hell.
    From the 15th-16th centuries onwards, the European powers in the early stages of capitalism began to extend their predatory claws into Asia. By the end of the 19th century, the East (except for Japan) had almost all fallen into imperialist colonies or semi-colonies. To achieve this predatory goal, the imperialists adopted and continue to adopt means of oppression ranging from direct, open, and shameless plunder to various military, political, economic, and cultural measures. They formed alliances with local feudal forces, compradors, and usurious bourgeoisie as the basis for their rule over colonies and semi-colonies. Due to the plunder and exploitation of the wealth and labor of the people of the colonies and semi-colonies, the imperialist robbers have all become bloated and wealthy, while the vast laboring people of the colonial and semi-colonial countries are plunged into abject poverty.
    To describe the miserable slave lives of the masses, especially women and children, in these colonial and semi-colonial countries, cannot be done in a short time. To save time, let us give a few typical examples.
    For example, India, because India has been a colony of British imperialism for several centuries. The living conditions of the Indian people are typical of the lives of the people in all colonial and semi-colonial countries in the East.
    Official figures also admit that 70 to 80 percent of the Indian people are constantly in a state of hunger. The daily income of the general laboring people is not enough to eat two meals of coarse and unnutritious food. They have almost no clothes to wear and sleep on the streets all year round. Due to extremely poor living conditions, the adult and child mortality rates in India are alarmingly high. Sixty percent of deaths are due to hunger and malnutrition, as well as poor sanitation. Infectious diseases are rampant in India. Millions of people die from infectious diseases every year. The periodic famines caused by the bankruptcy of the countryside take the lives of millions of people each time. Forty percent of Indians die before the age of fifteen due to hunger and disease.
    The fate of women is inseparable from the fate of the entire people. The only difference is that the fate of women is even more tragic than that of men. Indian peasant women work together with peasants on the small plots of land of landlords, giving most of the harvest to the landlords. They are constantly starving, often watching their own children die of malnutrition with tears in their eyes. There are more than two million female factory workers in India. The wages of male workers are already so low that they are not enough to buy half a kilogram of rice a day, and the wages of female workers are even lower. There are no laws to protect female workers in factories. Even if there are such laws in some places, the factories can completely disregard these laws and arbitrarily dismiss pregnant women. Almost all maternity women do not get prenatal and postnatal rest, and the mortality rate of maternity women is very high.
    Only fifteen percent of the people in India have received education, and almost one hundred percent of peasant women are illiterate.
    In summary, extreme economic poverty, complete political disempowerment, and low social status – this is a vivid portrayal of the tragic lives of Indian laboring women as colonial slaves.
    Let us take Iran as another example:
    Iran is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Imperialists have been carrying out aggression against Iran for nearly a century. After World War II, American imperialists intensified their intrusion into Iran, making a fortune by plundering Iran's resources – oil – and imposing extremely reactionary and obscurantist rule on the Iranian people through Iran's feudal forces. The lives of the vast majority of Iranian people have fallen into an extremely impoverished, ignorant, and desperate situation.
    "In the Iranian oilfield area where British and American imperialists extract huge profits, Iranian fathers, driven by poverty, sell their daughters for as low as one thousand francs. … Women are used to till the land instead of oxen.
    In Iran, women can be seen everywhere working diligently in front of carpet weaving machines, working up to fifteen hours a day. They weave and cough incessantly, spitting up fresh blood. Most of the young female weavers become deformed due to overwork, and this condition often leads to death when they become pregnant after marriage. They pay the price of their lives so that the bosses can make a fortune. … No matter what department they work in, women's wages are only half of men's. … Female workers in tanneries have simply lost their human appearance, because they often work for fifteen hours in humid, hot, and dark places, and their limbs are damaged by nitric acid. They eat inedible, coarse food, and get only a few copper coins a day. ..."
    Iranian women have no political status at all. Ninety percent are illiterate.
    It is so in India and Iran, and so in Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, French-occupied areas of Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iraq, southern Korea… The same situation exists in all colonial and semi-colonial countries. This is a portrayal of the people of all nationalities and their women in countries that have been turned into colonies and semi-colonies. This is the "civilization" that imperialist countries have brought to our "backward" nations in Asia, and this is the "great achievement" that imperialism has demonstrated after centuries of colonial rule over Asian nations.
    The extremely humble status and extremely tragic lives of women in colonial and semi-colonial countries are the most obvious evidence of the bloody crimes of imperialist colonial rule.
    III. Asian Women Fight to Resist Colonial Slavery. Dear Sisters:
    What we are proud of is that Asian women are not docile slaves. On the contrary, we not only feel deeply pained by this slave life, but we have been and are constantly fighting to break free from these chains of slavery! We deeply know that the fate of women is inseparable from the fate of the entire nation. Without national independence and people's democracy, there can be no systematic improvement of women's lives and no guarantee of women's rights. Therefore, since the predatory claws of imperialism extended into our country, our ancestors to us have been waging unyielding and persistent struggles in order to drive the imperialists out of our country and strive for the independence of our nations. For centuries, the process by which the imperialists and the internal feudal forces and other reactionary forces of our various nations combined to turn our countries into colonies and semi-colonies has also been the process by which the masses of people of our various nations have resisted imperialism and its running dogs.
    Here, we can give a few famous historical examples to illustrate the spirit of resistance of our Asian people and women who have never been willing to succumb to the imperialists and their running dogs.
    As early as 1857, the great national uprising of the Indian people to resist the rule of British imperialism disregarded the bloody suppression of the British imperial army and lasted for four years. Women carried bullets for the soldiers under the artillery fire and repaired the city walls. Peasant women helped their husbands and brothers load bullets, and stood in the positions of fallen soldiers.
    As early as 1825, the people of Java, Indonesia, held an uprising to resist Dutch oppression, which persisted for five years under the cruel attacks of the Dutch army. In the national liberation movement in Java in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the young and heroic female leader Kartini became a symbol of the Javanese people and Javanese women striving for national liberation and women's liberation. (Attached picture)
    In China, since the intrusion of imperialist forces in 1840, the Chinese people have never stopped fighting against imperialism and its agents for more than a hundred years. From the Opium War, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom... the Xinhai Revolution, the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, the Great Revolution of China in 1925-27, to the later War of Resistance Against Japan and the recent People's Liberation War against the US and Chiang... persisting and unyielding. It is precisely because of this that the imperialists have never been able to destroy China, and today, more than a hundred years later, they have seized the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. Chinese women participated in the successive revolutionary struggles in China. In the Great Revolution of China in 1925-27, female Communist Party member Xiang Jingyu bravely insisted on working for the liberation of workers and women under the enemy's crazy white terror. After she was arrested, she eloquently defended the innocence of the revolution in the enemy's court, and publicized the propositions of the revolution, which moved the enemy. Until the execution ground, she shouted revolutionary slogans and died heroically. Especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945 and the People's Liberation War against the US and Chiang from 1946 to the present, the number of Chinese women who participated became tens of thousands... becoming a vast mass movement, and many female heroes, female martyrs and a large number of outstanding female soldiers emerged. We will talk about these later.
    In addition, in Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Iran... in all colonial and semi-colonial countries, the people, including women, have all carried out extremely heroic struggles to resist imperialist aggression. Only on the blood of the people's slaughter did the imperialists establish their rule over these countries.
    IV. After World War II, the Unprecedented Upsurge of Asian National Liberation and Women's Liberation Movements
    The great socialist October Revolution in 1917 gave the liberation movement of the oppressed nations of Asia infinite impetus, enabling them to see the light in the darkness and discover hope in pain. The period of universal awakening of Asian nations has arrived. The anti-imperialist struggle of the people has developed, becoming more organized and penetrating into the masses. After the outbreak of World War II, the great unity of democratic forces worldwide, with the Soviet Union as the main force, defeated the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. The strength of imperialism was unprecedentedly weakened, and the national liberation movement and the people's democratic movement of the Asian people flourished and reached an unprecedentedly large scale.
    The spearhead of this powerful liberation movement was first directed at the Japanese imperialists. The tenacious struggle of the Asian people to overthrow Japanese imperialism (including the Chinese people's great eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Mongolian People's Republic's declaration of war against Japan, and the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare of the people of Southeast Asia and Korea) made a significant contribution to the Allied victory in the anti-fascist war. However, after Japan was defeated, the British, American, French, and Dutch imperialists, who had retreated in disgrace in the face of Japanese attacks, immediately returned, attempting to re-establish their colonial rule in Asia. This attempt was met with tenacious resistance from the Asian people. Understanding that the old set of rule methods was no longer applicable to these forces, which had become unprecedentedly powerful and whose level of awareness had been unprecedentedly raised, the imperialists played new tricks, wooing and enticing the reactionaries in various countries (feudal remnants and capitulationists in the bourgeoisie, who were also attempting to swallow the fruits of the people's victory), giving them some benefits and face, so that these reactionaries could come forward to put on the guise of nationalism, and in reality strangle the national liberation movement and people's democratic movement of various countries. The so-called "independence" of the Philippines and Burma, the so-called "dominion" status of India and Pakistan, and the so-called "republican government" of the Hatta group in Indonesia were the concrete implementation of this conspiracy. The overall leading role in this conspiracy was played by American imperialists. In order to try to turn Asian countries into its colonies and appendages, and on this basis, prepare for the Third World War, it spent 6 billion US dollars to help and arm the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries to attack the Chinese People's Liberation Army; it supported the British, French, and Dutch imperialists in attacking Malaya, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and it supported the puppet regime in southern Korea to obstruct the unification of the People's Republic of Korea. It played tricks in all countries in Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East, buying off their upper bourgeoisie and splitting the internal affairs of these countries; it especially favored the reactionary ruling class of India and its spokesman Nehru, striving to use his so-called "nationalism" and "liberalism" as a disguise to actually turn India into a tool of American imperialism in the Far East, and with Nehru as the head, unite all reactionary forces in Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Near East to form an anti-communist alliance (regardless of whether it is called the Pacific Pact or another name) to resist the victory of the Chinese people, strangle the national liberation movement and people's democratic movement of the Asian people, and prepare for an anti-Soviet, anti-people Third World War. For the same purpose, the American imperialists did not hesitate to support the revival of their past enemy – Japanese imperialists.
    The Asian people answered this conspiracy by insisting on unity, insisting on struggle, and opposing imperialism and its running dogs in various countries. The people of all China, united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, carried out the great People's Liberation War. In more than three years, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated the attack of millions of troops of the Kuomintang reactionary government aided by the United States, and turned to counterattack and attack, achieving an unprecedented great victory, and has now basically liberated all of China. The Vietnamese people have carried out a resolute armed struggle against French colonialists, and have today liberated 90 percent of their territory. The armed people of Burma have established bases of 50,000 square kilometers. In Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, southern Korea… people's guerrilla warfare is developing and persisting. In India, Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Iran… the people are also carrying out struggles in various ways to oppose imperialism and its reactionaries in their own countries, demanding complete national independence and people's democracy. Throughout Asia, the people are all taking action.
    From the War of Resistance Against Japan to the current struggle against the imperialist group headed by US imperialism and its running dogs, the role played by Asian women is worthy of our pride. Whether in China, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Burma, or Malaya, thousands of brave working-class and peasant women directly participated in the armed struggle, fighting side by side with men. A large number of intellectual women poured into the army and guerrilla teams, where they served in political, cultural, medical, telecommunications, and various other technical jobs. In the liberated areas, the vast number of women enthusiastically participated in supporting the front lines, transporting stretchers, rescuing wounded soldiers, sewing military uniforms, and supplying military rations. Female workers and peasant women worked hard in their respective posts to support the liberation war. Countless women sacrificed their lives in their heroic struggles. Many women carried out dangerous underground work in enemy-occupied areas. When arrested, they would rather endure all kinds of torture than betray their comrades and comrades-in-arms. For example, Korean representative Park Jung-ae, who is present today, had done fifteen years of arduous underground work in the Japanese-occupied area, was arrested many times, and suffered unimaginable medieval tortures, but she never yielded. It is no accident that she has become a leader loved by Korean women. In the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist struggle, female heroes like Nguyen Minh Khai have emerged. She organized and led the December 1940 uprising of the people of southern Vietnam. Although she herself was murdered by the enemy, her cause has been inherited and persisted by millions of Vietnamese women. Mongolian women directly participated in the anti-Japanese war in 1945. While fighting through the desert area of the 900-kilometer plateau, 65 women received medals for their heroic combat.
    The bravery and determination of Soviet women in the Patriotic War is even more well-known. In the Soviet republics in Asia, thousands of women directly participated in the armed forces and went to the front to fight. The women who remained in the rear took on all the work in the industrial and agricultural sectors left by the men. Even in the heavy industry and mining sectors, which were previously considered difficult for women, they replaced the men in order to supply and support the great Patriotic War.
    In China's eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War against the US and Chiang, countless female heroes have emerged. Their heroic achievements are too numerous to tell. To give a few examples, there is Chen Ruoke, who came from a working-class background. She participated in the extremely difficult anti-Japanese guerrilla war behind enemy lines in Shandong Province. When she was about to give birth, she was unfortunately captured by the enemy. The enemy used her newborn child in prison – her only child, to threaten her and ask her to reveal information about the anti-Japanese troops, but she resolutely did not reveal any secrets. After enduring unbearable torture, she embraced her child and heroically sacrificed under the enemy's bayonet. There is also the 16-year-old female hero Liu Hulan, who actively participated in the struggle against the reactionaries in Shanxi Province. When arrested, she was indomitable and calmly sacrificed, being beheaded by the enemy with a guillotine. There is also a female hero Li Xiuzhen, who not only contributed her only son to the People's Liberation War, but also persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines for a long time, risking being captured and killed by the enemy at any time, and doing secret communication work for the People's Liberation Army. When arrested, she would rather endure the enemy's torture than reveal any information. We have many heroic figures like these and in various work positions. Their bravery, determination, and spirit of self-sacrifice fully demonstrated the true fearlessness and heroic spirit of the Chinese nation and Chinese women in fighting against the enemy.
    Indian women have shown extraordinary courage in the struggle against imperialists and their agents in India. In 1946, in the Telengana peasant uprising in Hyderabad, central India, peasant women fought alongside men and established the first liberated area in Indian history. In the widespread rent resistance movement of peasants in the eastern provinces of India, peasant women fought stubbornly with hoes and rakes against armed military police sent by the reactionary government to protect the interests of landlords, so as to cover their men to harvest and hide quickly. Many women fell in the rain of bullets from the military police, but after collecting the bodies of their comrades, the peasant women continued to fight. In the strikes of factory workers, female workers are often the most determined.
    In estimating the importance of the struggle of the Indian people and Indian women, we must remember a saying of the great teacher of human liberation – Lenin: "In the final analysis, the outcome of the struggle will depend on Russia, India, China, etc., which account for the vast majority of the population." There are nearly 400 million people in India. Obviously, their struggle has an increasingly important significance in today's global struggle between war and peace, reaction and democracy, imperialists and oppressed nations.
    With the vigorous development of the national liberation struggle after the war and the enthusiastic participation of women in this struggle, women's democratic movements have had an unprecedented upsurge in almost all Asian countries. Women's democratic groups uniting tens of millions of women have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Among them, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, women in northern and southern Korea, India, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, as well as Thailand, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and other countries have all established their own organizations. They have joined the Women's International Democratic Federation. Japanese democratic women are fighting to eradicate fascism, for the democratization of Japan, and for the improvement of their lives. They have also organized and joined the Women's International Democratic Federation.
    In order to restore and consolidate their rule, and to achieve the goal of crushing the Asian people's liberation movement, the imperialists instigated their running dogs in various countries to launch a cruel attack on people's democratic groups. Therefore, today in India, Pakistan, the government-controlled areas of Thailand and Burma, the French-occupied areas of Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, southern Korea, and even Japan, as well as Iran, Iraq, and other countries in the Middle East and Near East, the basic rights of the people have either been completely deprived or restricted to zero. All the people's efforts to strive for true national independence, democracy, and improved living conditions are cruelly suppressed by the reactionary rulers. Women's democratic groups, trade unions, youth organizations, and all other mass democratic groups have either been dissolved or virtually suppressed to the point where they cannot function. Democratic leaders are imprisoned by the thousands. In India alone, 25,000 trade union and other mass organization cadres have been imprisoned. Muni, Kondura Shen, the leader of the Women's Self-Defense League of West Bengal, India, and a member of the executive committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation, is one of them. They have carried out a heroic hunger strike in prison. The Women's Democratic Union of Iran has also been dissolved, and its leaders have either been arrested or wanted. Its chairman, a famous Iranian female writer and also a member of the executive committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Marian Firoz, escaped harm, but was sentenced to five years in prison by the reactionary court and is still being wanted, working hard.
    However, no matter how rampant the imperialists and reactionaries are, the flame of the people's struggle can never be extinguished. When any minimal democratic rights are deprived, the people have no choice but to take up arms to defend themselves and fight. This is why today in many Asian countries, the armed struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, demanding national independence and people's democracy, has become or is increasingly becoming the main form of people's struggle, and the women's democratic movement has been or is increasingly combining with armed struggle, becoming a powerful complement to armed struggle. The experience of China tells us that only by resolutely using the armed people to oppose the armed counter-revolution can the oppressed nations in colonies and semi-colonies gain freedom and liberation. Dear Sisters:
    We Asian women do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to fight imperialism and reactionaries, because we know that the purpose of our struggle is not only for the independence of our nations, the democracy of the people, and a better life, but also for the democratic happiness and lasting peace of mankind worldwide. We deeply know that since the October Revolution gave birth to the great socialist country – the Soviet Union, the struggle of the oppressed nations of the East for liberation has been linked to the struggle of the people of capitalist countries in the West for democracy and peace, becoming inseparable. The struggle of the Asian people for liberation seriously hit the foundation on which imperialism depends for its survival, greatly weakened the strength of imperialism, and hindered their conspiracy to prepare for a new war. Therefore, this struggle is an important component of the struggle of the people of all countries in the world for lasting peace. We Asian women have played our role in this great struggle, and we feel extremely honored.
    V. The Fruits of Victory in the Struggle of the Asian People and Women
    For centuries, the Asian people and Asian women have been unyielding in their struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and lasting peace. Now, they have gained rich fruits of victory.
    First of all, the great socialist revolution of 1917 completely liberated the people of all ethnic groups in the Central Asian region, which formerly belonged to Tsarist Russia, from their status as oppressed slaves. The impact of this great change on the oppressed people of Asia is unparalleled. "The great October Revolution marked a complete turning point in the history of mankind around the world. It destroyed the imperialist rule in colonies and dependent countries, awakened the oppressed masses of the East, and opened a new page in their liberation struggle." Then, in 1921, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the people of Outer Mongolia drove out Japanese imperialism and Chinese warlords of the Northern Warlords, defeated the domestic feudal remnants, and established their own people's republic. In August 1945, the Soviet Red Army liberated Korea, enabling the Korean people, who had been fighting for a long time to resist Japanese enslavement, to establish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In 1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was born on the basis of the Vietnamese people's anti-Japanese and anti-French struggle. It was also produced under the premise that the Allied forces led by the Soviet Union defeated the German and Japanese fascists. The Asian people went from victory to victory. In October 1949, the great People's Republic of China was founded!
    The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is the result of the Chinese people's century of arduous struggle, especially the 28 years of adhering to unity and struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This victory was obtained with the assistance of the international peace and democracy forces led by the great Soviet Union under the leadership of the great teacher of the world's working people, Marshal Stalin, in various ways.
    As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "In the era of imperialism, the true people's revolution in any country, without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways, cannot achieve its own victory. After victory, it is also impossible to consolidate it. ... If there were no existence of the Soviet Union, if there were no victory in the anti-fascist World War II, if there were no overthrow of Japanese imperialism, if there were no emergence of new democratic countries, if there were no oppressed nations of the East who were rising up to struggle, if there were no struggle between the masses of people and the reactionary rulers in capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, if there were no comprehensive integration of all these, then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads must be many times greater than they are now. In this case, can we win? Obviously not. After victory, it is also impossible to consolidate it."
    The victory of the Chinese people is a common victory for the peaceful and democratic cause of the people all over the world. It is a serious failure for American imperialism and another fatal blow to the entire imperialist system and its reactionary and war camp.
    The birth of the People's Republic of China officially ended the rule of imperialists and domestic reactionary forces over China. The great transformation of 475 million people, plus the people of other Asian People's Republics, has liberated half of the total population of Asia. This historic victory has inspired the struggle of colonial and semi-colonial people throughout Asia and the world, thus sounding the death knell for the shaky rule of imperialists in other parts of Asia!
    The great century in which the Asian people control their own destiny has arrived! There is no force in the world that can reverse this historical wheel.
    We Asian women greet these great victories of the people with unparalleled joy and excitement, because these victories have also opened a new era for our cause of women's liberation.
    In the liberated areas of China, Mongolia, northern Korea, and Vietnam, the status of women has undergone fundamental changes. Women have changed from the oppressed, subordinate, and powerless status of the past to free, independent, and equal citizens with men. Democratic governments have abolished all systems that bind and oppress women, and promulgated laws that women are completely equal to men in politics, economics, society, and all aspects. In land reform, women obtained an equal share of land as men. In factories and various other enterprises, equal pay for equal work has been implemented as much as possible. Democratic governments and the people have worked together to eliminate illiteracy with the greatest efforts, and women originally accounted for the majority of illiterates. What is particularly important is that due to the large-scale participation of women in production, this has created an economically independent and autonomous status for women, thereby laying the foundation for the complete liberation of women. Women in these countries have actively participated in the people's regime and the construction of economic, cultural, educational, technological, health, and childcare aspects, and have shown great achievements.
    Here, I will cite a recent material from the new China to show what a major change has taken place in the status of Chinese women:
    In this historically significant Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that produced the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, there were a total of 69 female representatives, accounting for 10.4 percent of the total number of representatives. In the new Central People's Government, there is one female vice-chairman, two members of the Central People's Government Committee, two ministers (Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Health), one deputy minister (Ministry of Textile Industry), one deputy secretary-general of the State Council, one deputy director of the General Office, and 17 other members of the various committees of the government.
    This is only in terms of the newly established central government. As for the women who participate in leading positions in the local provincial, municipal, county, district, and township governments, there are tens of millions of them.
    If it is said that Chinese women have only begun to gain liberation, then the women in the Soviet Asian republics have been completely liberated. We know that the socialist republics of the Soviet Union in Asia today were all colonies of Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution. The people suffered as much oppression, economic backwardness, poor living conditions, and cultural ignorance as India does today. The lives of women were particularly miserable. They not only had no rights, were completely illiterate, and were completely enslaved, but could also be bought and sold as commodities.
    The great socialist October Revolution eradicated the exploitation system that caused this poverty and misery from the root, thus opening up a path of freedom, equality, and happiness for the various nations that were formerly oppressed by the Great Russian Empire. The Soviet federal government used great strength to help the development of these nations, enabling them to develop from extremely backward countries into economically prosperous and culturally developed countries.
    Therefore, the status of women there has also undergone a complete change. The socialist constitution guarantees all due rights of women of all nationalities. Women have gained full opportunities for education, actively participated in socialist industrial, agricultural, and cultural construction, and countless outstanding talents have emerged in the political, economic, cultural, and other departments.
    In the Soviet republics in Asia, women are able to participate in agricultural and industrial production and in political, cultural, and other aspects, while at the same time not hindering them as happy mothers of children. This is because in their country, nurseries, kindergartens, childcare centers, etc. are universally established to reduce their burden of housework. The Soviet government takes all necessary and possible measures to protect mothers and children. Therefore, Soviet women never need to worry about the future of themselves and their children. Only the socialist system can completely liberate women in this way and give women such a complete happiness.
    VI. The Enormous Tasks Before Us
    Dear Sisters:
    While we are reviewing the rich fruits of our struggle with incomparable joy and celebrating the great victory of our Asian people, of course we must not forget at any time, nor will we forget, that there are still very enormous tasks before us that need to be completed.
    First of all, we must not forget, nor will we forget, that nearly half of the population of Asia (half of which are women) are still under the dark rule of imperialists and domestic reactionaries today. They still need to go through a very arduous and tortuous struggle before they can reach victory.
    In those countries, some have already obtained nominal "independence," such as India, Burma, and the Philippines. The task of the women there is to expose this false "independence," expose the collusion between the reactionary feudal forces and the upper big bourgeoisie in their own countries and imperialism, expose their true faces of betraying national interests, unite the broad masses, and fight for true national independence, people's democracy, and the improvement of the lives of the laboring people.
    There are also some countries that are suffering from the armed aggression of imperialists, such as Vietnam, Malaya, and Indonesia. The primary task of the women there is to support and participate in their own people's sacred self-defense liberation war with all their strength, in order to completely expel the imperialists from the country and strive for national independence and people's democracy.
    There are also some countries that are nominally independent but are actually under the control of imperialism, such as Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. The task of the women there is to expose the essence of the semi-colonial regimes of their reactionary governments, unite the entire people to abolish all the privileges of imperialism in their own countries and all the reactionary systems that oppress the people, to establish an independent and free people's republic, and to fight for the improvement of

　　亚洲妇女为民族独立人民民主与世界和平而斗争
    邓颖超在亚洲妇代会议上的报告
    【新华社北京十一日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超在今日的亚洲妇女代表会议上作了“亚洲妇女为民族独立、人民民主与世界和平而斗争”的报告。全文如下：亲爱的姊妹们：
    我今天能够向你们来作这个关于亚洲妇女为民族独立、人民民主与世界和平而斗争的报告，感到十分的光荣。
    这个由国际民主妇联所召开的历史上第一次的亚洲妇女代表会议在中国的北京举行，其意义是异常深长的。北京是中国历代以来的文化中心。在这里，我们可以欣赏到中国文化之无限丰富的宝藏。这个会议在北京举行，不能不使我们联想到中国以及其他亚洲民族的悠久而灿烂的文化，从而使我们产生无限的民族自信心。北京同时又是新中国人民共和国的首都，它象征的不仅是中国人民的大翻身，而且也象征了整个亚洲被压迫民族的斗争业已发展到一个新的阶段。因此，这个会议在北京举行，又不能不使我们欢欣鼓舞，对我们亚洲被压迫民族与被压迫妇女解放斗争的前途充满了胜利的信心。
    一、亚洲民族是具有悠久文化历史的民族
    亚洲各民族是具有悠久文化历史的民族。譬如说：中国，它的有记载的历史已经有五千年了。火药、指南针、纸张和印刷术——这几种对全世界的文化有重大贡献的发明，都创始于中国。中国的历史上曾经产生过不少伟大的思想家和杰出的文学家。中国人民的几种特出的劳动成品——磁器、刺绣、翡翠与象牙的雕刻品和漆器等，其精美在全世界都罕有伦匹。再说印度，它在公元前三千年便已经有了高度的文化。印度人民在哲学和文学上的造就是很大的。他的医学、农学和数学，都曾经达到高度的水准。许多世纪以来，中东都曾经是全世界伊斯兰文化的中心。伊朗的历史也已经有三千年。伊朗的史诗是有世界荣誉的。其他的亚洲各民族也都各有其对世界文明的重要贡献。
    亚洲各国的土地是广大富饶，占世界陆地总面积的三分之一。农作物及其他动植物资源非常丰富。
    亚洲的人口很多，占地球上总人口的一半以上。我们的人民是有名的勤恳和耐劳，并且聪明而富于创造力。
    亲爱的姊妹们！凭着这样丰富的文化遗产和天然的富源，加上我们人民勤恳的劳动，我们本来具有充分的可能来给我们自己和我们的孩子创造富裕的文明的幸福的生活。然而几千年来的封建制度束缚了我们生产力之发展，几世纪以来的帝国主义殖民地制度又吸干了我们的血。我们广大人民用自己的劳动所创造的财富，绝大部分被那少数吸血的压迫者与剥削者——而其中主要是帝国主义强盗——所掠夺去了，我们的劳动人民自己则陷于极度的贫困和饥寒交迫的境地。
    如果有人讥笑亚洲的人民为落后（在英文里的所谓“亚细亚的”。（Ａｓｉａｔｉｃ）是含有原始和落后的意思），那么，我们可以理直气壮地告诉他：具有悠久和高度发展的文化的亚洲各民族人民在近代是曾经落伍了的话，那么，这种落伍，完全是外国帝国主义和本国反动派的残酷压迫，超度剥削和愚民政策所造成的结果。我们所引以自傲的，恰恰在于我们的人民从来就不甘落伍，从来就不甘心作奴隶。我们不单珍爱我们民族古代的文化，我们还要创造新的文明和幸福，并以之贡献于全人类。为了达到这个目的，我们就必须首先挣脱帝国主义强盗所加在我们身上的镣铐；而我们正是这样做了。几世纪以来，我们的祖先一直到我们，曾经进行了不屈不挠的斗争，来反对帝国主义侵略者及其在我们国内的走狗。到了今天，这斗争业已开了灿烂的花，结了胜利的果。我们苏联中央亚细亚各共和国的光荣的姊妹们便是最好的榜样。中国、蒙古、朝鲜和越南等人民共和国里的妇女们也都是在这个斗争中结了胜利果实的具体证明。
    二、帝国主义强盗把亚洲变成了各民族人民的牢狱
    现在让我们先来看一看，帝国主义强盗们曾经把我们亚洲人民美丽而富裕的祖国变成怎样贫困和凄惨的地狱。
    从十五——十六世纪起，处在前期资本主义的欧洲列强就开始把它们侵略的魔爪伸入亚洲。到了十九世纪末叶以后，东方（除了日本）就差不多都沦陷为帝国主义的殖民地或半殖民地。为了达到他们的这个强盗目的，帝国主义者就采取了和还在继续采取着从直接的、公开的，无耻的劫掠，一直到各种军事的、政治的、经济的、文化的压迫手段，他们和本地的封建势力、买办和高利贷资产阶级结成联盟，作为他们统治殖民地半殖民地的基础。由于对殖民地半殖民地人民的财富和劳动力的掠夺剥削，帝国主义强盗们一个个都变成大腹便便，而殖民地半殖民地国家的广大劳动人民则陷于赤贫。
    要来描写这些殖民地半殖民地国家内人民大众，特别是妇女儿童的悲惨的奴隶生活，不是短时间说得尽的。为了节省时间，让我们举几个典型的例子吧。
    例如印度，因为印度从几个世纪以来就是英国帝国主义者的殖民地。印度人民的生活状况是东方一切殖民地半殖民地国家内人民生活的典型。
    官方的数字也承认：印度人民的百分之七十到八十是经常在饥饿状态中。一般劳动人民每天的收入要吃两顿粗糙而无营养的饭还不够，他们差不多没有衣穿，全年露宿在街头。由于生活条件太恶劣，印度成人的和儿童的死亡率之高是惊人的。死亡的原因百分之六十是由于饥饿和营养不足，以及卫生环境太坏。传染病在印度异常猖獗。每年有数百万的人因为传染病而死亡。由于农村破产而造成的周期性的灾荒，每次都夺去千百万人民的生命。百分之四十的印度人在十五岁以前就因饥饿和疾病而死亡。
    妇女的命运是和整个人民的命运分不开的，所不同的，就是妇女的命运比男人更悲惨。印度农妇和农民一起在地主的小块土地上耕作，把收获所得的大部分交给地主。常年挨着饿，往往含着眼泪，看着亲生的孩子为了营养不够而死去。印度的工厂女工有二百多万。男工的工资已经是低到一天不够买半公斤的米，而女工的工资就更低。在工厂中没有保护女工的法律。即使有的地方有，厂方亦可以完全不遵守这种法律，任意开除孕妇。产妇几乎全部得不到产前产后的休息，产妇的死亡率很大。
    全印度只有百分之十五的人民受过教育，农妇则几乎百分之百的文盲。
    总起来说，经济上极度贫困，政治上完全无权，社会上地位低下，这就是作为殖民地奴隶的印度劳动妇女悲惨生活的写照。
    让我们再举伊朗为例：
    伊朗是一个半封建半殖民地的国家。帝国主义者对伊朗已经进行了近百年的侵略，二次世界大战后，美帝国主义者更加紧侵入伊朗，从掠夺伊朗的富源——石油上发了大财，并通过伊朗的封建势力把极端反动和愚民的统治强压在伊朗人民的头上。伊朗广大人民的生活陷于极端的贫困和愚昧的绝境。
    “在英美帝国主义者吸取巨额利润的伊朗油田区，被穷困逼得没有办法的伊朗父亲们用一千法朗的低价出卖他们的女儿。……女人们用来代替牛耕田。
    在伊朗，到处可以看到妇女们在织地毯的机子前面辛勤工作，每天达十五小时。她们一百不停的织，一百咳嗽着，吐着鲜血。大多数的年轻的女织工由于工作过度而身体的发育成为畸形，这种病态在他们婚后怀孕时常常致死。她们付出生命的代价以便老板们可以发大财。……不论在那一部门工作，妇女的工资都只有男子的一半。……在硝皮厂工作的女工简直失去了人的模样，因为她们常常连十五小时在潮湿闷热和黑暗的场所工作，她们的四肢给硝酸所损伤。她们吃的是不堪入咽的粗劣食物，一天只得到几个铜板。……”
    伊朗的妇女在政治上没有丝毫地位。百分之九十是文盲。
    在印度和伊朗是如此，在巴基斯坦、缅甸、泰国、越南的法占区、马来亚、印尼、菲律宾、伊拉克、朝鲜南部……也是如此。同样的情形存在于一切殖民地和半殖民地国家。这就是被变成殖民地半殖民地的国家内各族人民及其妇女的写照。这就是帝国主义国家所带给我们亚洲“落后”民族的“文明”，这就是帝国主义对亚洲各民族进行了几个世纪的殖民统治所表现的“伟大政绩”。
    殖民地半殖民地国家内妇女的极端卑微地位和极度悲惨的生活，是帝国主义殖民地统治的血腥罪恶之最明显的证据。
    三、亚洲妇女为反抗殖民地的奴役而斗争亲爱的姊妹们：
    我们所引以自傲的，就是亚洲妇女并不是顺从的奴隶。相反的，我们不仅对这种奴隶生活感到痛心疾首，而且我们曾经和正在不断的为挣脱这种奴隶的锁链而斗争！我们深深知道，妇女的命运是和全民族的命运分不开的。没有民族的独立和人民民主主谈不到妇女生活的有系统的改善和妇女权利的保障。因此，自从帝国主义的魔爪伸入我们的国土起，我们的祖先直到我们，就曾经进行了不屈不挠、再接再厉的斗争，以便把帝国主义者赶出国土，争取我们民族的独立。几百年以来，帝国主义者和我们各民族内部的封建势力及其他反动势力相结合，把我们的国家变为殖民地与半殖民地的过程，也就是我们各民族人民大众反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程。
    这里可以举几个历史上的有名例子，来说明我们亚洲人民和妇女从来就不甘屈服于帝国主义者及其走狗的反抗精神。
    早在一八五七年，印度人民为反抗英帝国主义的统治而举行的伟大的民族起义，曾经不顾英帝国军队的血腥镇压，而持续了四年之久。妇女们曾经在炮火之下替战士们搬运子弹，修理城墙。农妇帮助丈夫和兄弟装子弹，自己立在仆倒地下的战士之位置上。
    早在一八二五年，印尼爪哇的人民就为了反抗荷兰的压迫而举行起义，这起义在荷兰军队的残酷进攻下，坚持了五年之久。在十九世纪末二十世纪初爪哇的民族解放运动中，年青的英勇的妇女领袖卡丁妮成为爪哇人民与爪哇妇女争取民族解放与妇女解放的象征。（附图片）
    在中国，自从一八四○年帝国主义势力侵入以后，一百多年来，中国人民就从来不曾停止过反抗帝国主义及其代理人的斗争。从鸦片战争，太平天国……辛亥革命，一九一九年“五四”运动，一九二五——二七年的中国大革命，一直到后来的抗日战争及最近这一次反美反蒋的人民解放战争……再接再厉，不屈不挠。也正由于这，才使得帝国主义者始终不能灭亡中国，并且在一百多年后的今天，取中国人民大革命的伟大的胜利。中国的妇女参加了中国历次的革命斗争。一九二五——二七的中国大革命中，女共产党员向警予为了工人和妇女的解放，在敌人疯狂的白色恐怖下勇敢的坚持工作。当她被捕以后，在敌人的法庭上，慷慨抗辩革命无罪，宣传革命的主张，敌人也为之动容。直到刑场上她高呼革命口号，英勇就义。特别是一九三七——四五年的抗日战争和一九四六年到现在的反美反蒋的人民解放战争，中国妇女参加的人数那就更是成千成万……成为广大群众性的了，并出现子许多女英雄，女烈士和大批优秀的女战士。这些我们要在后而谈到。
    此外，在朝鲜、越南、菲律宾、马来亚、缅甸、伊朗……一切殖民地半殖民地国家中，人民，其中包括妇女在内，都无不进行了极其英勇的斗争来反抗帝国主义的侵略。只有在屠杀人民的血泊上，帝国主义者才建立起对这些国家的统治。
    四、第二次世界大战后，亚洲民族解放与妇女解放运动的空前高涨
    一九一七年伟大的社会主义十月革命给了亚洲被压迫民族的解放运动以无限的推动，使他们在黑暗中望见了光明，痛苦中发现了希望。亚洲民族普遍觉醒的时期来到了。人民的反帝斗争发展了，成为更有组织，而且深入到群众中去。第二次世界大战发生后，以苏联为主力军的全世界民主力量大团结，击败了德意日法西斯蒂，帝国主义的力量空前削弱，亚洲人民的民族解放运动与人民民主运动便蓬勃发展起来，并且达到空前巨大的规模。
    这个强大的解放运动的矛头，首先曾经是对准了日本帝国主义者。亚洲人民为打倒日本帝国主义而进行的顽强斗争（其中包括中国人民伟大的八年抗日战争，蒙古人民共和国的对日宣战，和东南亚以及朝鲜人民的抗日游击战争），对于同盟国反法西斯战争的胜利有其重大的贡献。然而日本被击败后，曾经在日本的进攻面前狼狈溃退的英、美、法、荷帝国主义者，却立刻就卷土重来，企图在亚洲重新恢复其殖民地统治，这一企图遭遇到亚洲人民的顽强抵抗。了解到对于这些力量已空前强大而且觉悟程度已空前提高的人民，已经不适用旧的一套统治方法，帝国主义者就玩弄新的花样，拉摆和利诱各国的反动派（封建残余和资产阶级中的投降派，他们也正企图侵吞人民胜利的果实），给他们以若干好处和面子，以便由这些反动派出面装出民族主义的幌子，而在实际上绞杀各国的民族解放运动与人民民主运动。菲律宾和缅甸的所谓“独立”，印度和巴基斯坦的所谓“自治领”的地位，以及印尼的哈达集团之所谓“共和国政府”，便是这种阴谋的具体实施。在这个阴谋中起总的带头作用的是美国帝国主义者。它为了企图把亚洲各国变为它的殖民地和附属国，并且在这个基础上，准备第三次世界战争，曾经花费了六十万万美金来帮助和武装中国国民党反动派以进攻中国人民解放军；它支持英、法、荷帝国主义者进攻马来亚、越南和印尼，它扶植朝鲜南部的傀儡政权，以阻碍朝鲜人民共和国的统一。它在东南亚和近东中东一切国家内玩弄花样，收买他们的上层资产阶级，分裂这些国家的内部；它特别垂青于印度的反动统治阶级及其代言人尼赫鲁，力图利用他的所谓“民族主义”和“自由主义”作伪装，把印度实际上变成美国帝国主义在远东的工具，并且以尼赫鲁为首，团结东南亚和中东近东一切反动势力，结成反共同盟（不管它叫作太平洋公约还是别的名称），来对抗中国人民的胜利，绞杀亚洲人民的民族解放运动和人民民主运动并准备反苏反人民的第三次世界战争。为了同样的目的，美帝国主义者甚至不惜扶助它过去的敌人——日本帝国主义者的复兴。
    亚洲人民以坚持团结，坚持斗争，反对帝国主义及其在各国的走狗，来回答这一阴谋。全中国的人民团结在中国共产党及其英明的领袖毛泽东主席的领导之下，进行了伟大的人民解放战争。在三年多的时间内，英勇的中国人民解放军战胜了美国援助的国民党反动政府数百万军队的进攻，并使自己转入了反攻和进攻，取得了史无前例的伟大胜利，现在已基本上解放了全中国。越南人民进行了反抗法国殖民主义者的坚决武装斗争，今天已解放百分之九十的国土。缅甸的人民武装已经建立了五万平方公里的根据地。在马来亚、印尼、菲律宾、朝鲜南部……人民游击战争正在发展和坚持。在印度、巴基斯坦、日本、泰国、伊朗……人民也正在以各种不同的方式进行斗争，反对帝国主义及其在本国的反动派，要求完全的民族独立和人民民主。在整个的亚洲，人民都在行动起来了。
    从抗日一直到现在的反对以美帝为首的帝国主义集团及其走狗的斗争中，亚洲妇女所起的作用是值得我们自傲的。不管是在中国、在朝鲜、在越南、印尼、菲律宾、缅甸、在马来亚，成千成万勇敢的工农妇女都直接参加了武装斗争，和男子并肩作战。大批知识分子的妇女涌入了军队和游击队，她们担任政治的、文化的、医药的、电讯的，以及其他各种技术工作。在解放了的地区，广大妇女热烈参加支援前线的工作，担架运输，救护伤兵，缝纫军衣，供应军粮。女工和农妇各自在她们的岗位上努力生产，来支持解放战争。无数的妇女在她们英勇的斗争中献出了她们的生命。许多妇女在敌占区进行危险的地下工作，被捕时，宁可忍受一切的酷刑，决不出卖她们的同志和战友。例如今天在座的朝鲜代表朴正爱，她曾经在日本占领区做过十五年艰苦的地下工作，多次被捕，并且受到人们所难于想象的中世纪的酷刑，但是她绝未屈服。她之成为朝鲜妇女爱戴的领袖，并不是偶然的。在越南人民的反帝斗争中，曾经涌现了象阮明开那样的女英雄。她组织并领导了一九四○年十二月越南南部人民的起义，虽然她自己被敌人所残杀，但是她的事业却被千千万万的越南妇女承继并坚持下来。蒙古妇女直接参加一九四五年的对日战争，在通过九百基罗米突高原的荒漠地带作战时，有六十五个妇女因英勇作战，得到奖章。
    苏联妇女参加爱国战争之英勇坚决更是人所共知。苏联在亚洲的各共和国里，成千成万的妇女直接参加了武装部队到前线去作战，留在后方的妇女把男人们所留下的工业和农业各部门工作统统都担当起来，甚至在以前认为妇女难于胜任的重工业和采矿部门，她们也都代替了男子，这样来供给和支援了伟大的爱国战争。
    在中国八年的抗日战争和三年反美反蒋的人民解放战争中，曾经涌现了无数的女英雄。她们的英勇业绩是讲也讲不完的。举几个例子来说，如女工出身的陈若克，她参加了山东省敌后极端艰苦的抗日游击战争，在临近分娩时不幸被敌人所捕。敌人拿她在监狱里生下的孩子——她唯一的独生子，来胁威她，要她供出抗日部队的消息，但是她坚决不吐露任何秘密。在忍受了难于忍受的酷刑之后，她怀抱着孩子，英勇的牺牲在敌人的刺刀下。又如十六岁的女英雄刘胡兰，她在山西省积极参加对反动派的斗争，被捕时威武不屈，从容就义，为敌人用铡刀铡死。还有一位女英雄李秀真，她不单把她唯一的独生子贡献给了人民解放战争，她本人也长期坚持敌后斗争，冒着随时给敌人捕杀的危险，给解放军作秘密的通讯联络工作，被捕时宁可忍受敌人的拷打，没有泄露半点消息。我们有着象这样的和在各种工作岗位上的很多英雄人物，她们的英勇坚决和自我牺牲精神，充分表现了中华民族和中国妇女在和敌人作斗争时的真正大无畏的英雄气概。
    印度妇女在和帝国主义者及其在印度的代理人所作的斗争中，表现了异常的勇敢。一九四六年，在印度中部海德拉邦的台伦甘纳的农民起义中，农妇和男子并肩战斗，建立了印度历史上的第一个解放区。在印度东部各省农民普遍的抗租运动中，农妇们手执锄耙和反动政府派来保护地主利益的武装的军警进行顽强的搏斗。以掩护他们的男人快收快藏。很多妇女在军警的弹雨中倒下，但是收拾一下同志的尸体，农妇们还是继续搏斗，在工厂工人的罢工中，女工也往往是最坚决的。
    在估计到印度人民和印度妇女的斗争的重要性时，我们不能不记起全人类解放事业的伟大导师——列宁的一向话：“归根到底，斗争的结局将取决于俄国、印度、中国等占人口绝大部分这件事”。在印度有将近四万万的人民。很明显的，他们的斗争，在今天全世界范围的战争与和平、反动与民主、帝国主义者与被压迫民族的斗争中，具有日益重要的意义。
    随着战后民族解放斗争的蓬勃发展和妇女参加这一斗争的踊跃，在差不多所有的亚洲国家里，妇女民主运动都曾经有过空前的高涨。团结千万妇女群众的妇女民主团体如雨后春笋似的组织起来。其中如中华全国民主妇女联合会，朝鲜北部和南部、印度、越南、缅甸、马来亚、印尼，以及泰国、伊朗、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、以色列等国妇女，都成立了她们自己的组织。她们已经加入了国际民主妇女联合会。日本的民主妇女正在为根绝法西斯，为日本的民主化和为生活的改善而斗争，她们也已经组织起来，并且加入了国际妇联。
    帝国主义者为了恢复与巩固其统治，为了达到粉碎亚洲人民解放运动的目的，唆使其在各国的走狗对人民民主团体展开残酷的进攻。因而今天在印度、巴基斯坦、泰国、缅甸政府统治区、越南的法占区、马来亚、印尼、菲律宾、朝鲜南部以至日本，以及伊朗、伊拉克等中东近东的国家内，人民的基本权利或则已被剥夺干净，或则已被限制到等于零。人民一切为争取真正的民族独立、民主和改善生活的努力，都受到反动统治者的残酷镇压。妇女的民主团体，工会的和青年的，以及其他一切群众民主团体一样，都或则被解散了，或则被实际上压制到不能活动。民主领袖被成千成万的关在监牢里。单单在印度，就有二万五千个工会和其他群众组织的干部被监禁。印度西孟加尔省妇女自卫同盟的领袖，国际妇联的执行委员，慕尼、康都拉·沈，也是其中之一。她们曾经在监牢里进行了英勇的绝食斗争。伊朗的妇女民主联合会也被解散了，其领袖或被捕或被通缉。它的主席，伊朗有名的女作家，也是国际妇联的执委，玛丽安·菲洛兹，幸免于难，但被反动法庭判处五年徒刑，现尚在被通辑之下，艰苦努力。
    然而不管帝国主义者和反动派如何猖獗，人民斗争的火焰是永远不能扑灭的，到了任何起码的民主权利都被剥夺的时候，人民就只有拿起武器来保卫自己并进行斗争。此所以今天在许多亚洲国家里，反对帝国主义及其走狗、要求民族独立与人民民主的武装斗争已经或正在日益成为人民斗争的主要形式，妇女的民主运动也已经或正在日益和武装斗争结合起来，成为武装斗争的有力配合。中国的经验告诉我们，也只有坚决地以武装的人民来反对武装的反革命，殖民地半殖民地的被压迫民族才能得到自由和解放。亲爱的姊妹们：
    我们亚洲的妇女们不惜牺牲我们的生命和帝国主义及反动派作斗争，因为我们知道，我们斗争的目的，一方面是为了我们民族的独立，人民的民主和较好的生活，另一方面也是为了全世界人类的民主幸福与持久和平。我们深知，自从十月革命产生了伟大的社会主义国家——苏联以后，东方被压迫民族求解放的斗争就和西方资本主义国家人民求民主求和平的斗争联系起来了，成为不可分割的了。亚洲人民求解放的斗争，严重地打击了帝国主义赖以生存的基础，大大削弱帝国主义的力量，阻碍它们准备新战争的阴谋计划，因而，这个斗争正是全世界各国人民争取持久和平的斗争中的一个重要的组成部分。我们亚洲的妇女在这个伟大的斗争中尽了我们的作用，我们感到极其光荣。
    五、亚洲人民和妇女斗争的胜利果实
    几个世纪以来亚洲人民和亚洲妇女不屈不挠为争取民族独立，人民民主与持久和平而斗争，到了现在，已经获得了丰富的胜利果实。
    首先是一九一七年伟大的社会主义革命，把从前是属于沙皇俄罗斯帝国的中央亚细亚地区的各族人民从被压迫的奴隶地位中彻底解放了出来。这一个伟大的变革，对于亚洲被压迫人民的影响之大，是无可比拟的。“伟大的十月革命标志着全世界人类历史上的彻底转捩，它破坏了殖民地与附属国中帝国主义的统治，唤醒了东方被压迫的人民群众，揭开了他们解放斗争新的一页。”然后，一九二一年，在苏联红军的兄弟般的援助之下，外蒙古的人民赶走了日本帝国主义和中国的北洋军阀，战胜了国内的封建余孽，建立了人民自己的共和国。一九四五年八月，苏联红军解放了朝鲜，使业已长期为反抗日寇奴役而斗争的朝鲜人民得以建立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。一九四五年在越南人民抗日抗法斗争的基础上诞生了越南民主共和国，它也是在以苏联为首的同盟国战胜德日法西斯的前提下产生的。亚洲人民从胜利走向胜利，一九四九年十月，伟大的中华人民共和国成立了！
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，是中国人民百年来艰苦奋斗，特别是二十八年来在中国共产党领导之下坚持团结，坚持斗争的结果，这个胜利是在以全世界劳动人民的伟大导师斯大林大元帅领导下的伟大的苏联为首的国际和平民主力量以各种不同的方式援助之下获得的。
    正如毛泽东主席所指出：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。……假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们的反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。”
    中国人民的胜利，是全世界人民和平民主事业的共同胜利。是美帝国主义的严重失败，是对整个帝国主义体系以及它的反动和战争阵营的又一致命打击。
    中华人民共和国的诞生，正式结束了帝国主义者和国内反动势力对中国的统治。四万万七千五百万人民的大翻身，加上亚洲其他各人民共和国的人民，这就使全亚洲一半的人口获得了解放。这一具有历史意义的胜利鼓舞了全亚洲以及全世界殖民地半殖民地人民的斗争，因而给帝国主义者在亚洲其他部分的动摇的统治敲响了它的丧钟！
    亚洲人民自己掌握自己命运的伟大世纪已经来到了！世界上没有任何力量可以扳转这一历史的巨轮。
    我们亚洲的妇女以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情，来迎接这些人民的伟大胜利，因为这些胜利也给我们妇女解放事业开辟了新的纪元。
    在中国、蒙古、朝鲜北部和越南已解放地区里，妇女的地位都已经起了根本的变化。妇女们已经从过去被压迫的从属的毫无权利的地位，变成自由的独立的与男子平等的公民。民主政府废除了一切束缚与压迫妇女的制度，颁布了妇女在政治、经济、社会以及各方面与男子完全平等的法律。在土地改革中，妇女获得与男子同等的一份土地，在工厂和其他各种企业中尽最大可能地实行了同工同酬。民主政府与人民通力合作，用最大地努力来扫除文盲，而文盲中间，原来是以妇女占最多数的。特别重要的，是由于妇女大批地参加生产，这就从经济上造成了妇女独立自主的地位，从而奠定了妇女彻底解放的基础。这些国家的妇女都积极参加了人民的政权以及经济、文化、教育、技术、卫生和儿童保育各方面的建设，并且表现了很大的成绩。
    这里我就新中国最近的材料引用一件，以表明中国妇女的地位已经起了何等重大的变化：
    在这次产生中华人民共和国中央人民政府的具有历史意义的中国人民政治协商会议中，女代表一共有六十九人，占全体代表总数百分之十点四。在新的中央人民政府中，有一位女的副主席，二位中央人民政府委员会委员，二位部长（司法部和卫生部），一位副部长（纺织工业部），一位政务院的副秘书长，一位办公厅的副主任，以及其他十七位政府各委员会的委员。
    这仅是就新成立的中央政府而言，至于各地省、市、县、区和乡政府中参加领导地位的妇女那就数以千万计。
    如果说，中国的妇女还只是开始获得解放的话，那么，苏联在亚细亚各共和国的妇女是已经获得彻底解放了。我们知道，今天苏联在亚洲的各社会主义共和国，在十月革命以前都是沙皇帝俄的殖民地。其人民之遭受压迫，经济之落后，生活之贫困，文化之愚昧，不亚于今日的印度。其妇女生活尤为悲惨，不仅毫无权利，完全文盲，完全处于奴隶地位，而且可以作为货品买卖。
    伟大的社会主义十月革命从根铲除了造成这种贫困与悲惨的剥削制度，因而给从前被大俄帝国压迫的各民族，开辟了自由平等幸福的道路。苏维埃联邦政府用极大力量帮助这些民族的发展，使它们从极端落后的国家，发展成为经济繁荣文化发达的国家。
    那里妇女的地位因此也就起了彻底的变化。社会主义宪法保障了各民族妇女的一切应有的权利。妇女们获得了充分受教育的机会，积极参加社会主义的工业、农业、和文化的建设，在政治、经济、文化等部门中都涌现了无数杰出人才。
    苏联在亚洲的各共和国里，妇女们能够一方面参加农工生产，及政治、文化各方面工作，而同时又不妨碍她们作为孩子们的快乐母亲，这是因为在她们的国家里，普遍地建立着托儿所、幼稚园、保育院等，以减轻她们的家务负担，苏维埃政府采取一切必要与可能的办法，来保护母亲和孩子。因此，苏维埃的女性从来不需要为她目己和她孩子的前途而感到担忧。只有社会主义制度，才能把妇女这样彻底解放，才能给妇女以这样美满的幸福。
    六、摆在我们面前的巨大任务
    亲爱的姊妹们：
    当我们以无比的欢欣，检阅着我们斗争所得来的丰富果实，和庆祝着我们亚洲人民的伟大胜利的时候，当然我们时刻都不能忘记，也不会忘记，在我们的面前还有着十分巨大的任务需要我们来完成。
    首先，我们不能忘记，也不会忘记，亚洲还有着将近一半的人口（其中一半是妇女）今天还处在帝国主义者和国内反动派的黑暗统治之下。她们还需要经过十分艰苦与曲折的斗争，才能到达胜利。
    在那些国家里，有的是已经获得了名义上的“独立”的，如印度、缅甸、菲律宾等。那里的妇女们的任务，便是要揭破这种虚伪的假“独立”，揭破本国反动的封建势力及上层大资产阶级和帝国主义的勾结，暴露他们叛卖民族利益的真面目，团结广大群众，为争取真正的民族独立、人民的民主和劳动人民生活的改善而斗争。
    还有一些国家是正在遭受着帝国主义者的武装进攻的，如越南、马来亚和印尼等。那里的妇女的首要任务便是以一切力量来支援和参加她们本国人民的神圣的自卫的解放战争，以便完全驱逐帝国主义出国境，争取民族的独立与人民民主。
    另外还有一些国家，它们在名义上是独立的，但实际上处于帝国主义控制之下，如伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚等。那里的妇女的任务，便是揭露她们的反动政府的半殖民地政权的本质，团结全体人民为取消帝国主义在她们国内的一切特权及压迫人民的一切反动制度，为建立独立自由的人民共和国，并为广大群众与妇女生活的改善而斗争。
    日本的妇女，在美帝国主义占领当局和国内反动势力的双重压迫之下，生活也是十分痛苦。她们的任务，便是反对美帝国主义扶植日本封建法西斯的政策，反对把日本重新建设成为一个新的战争基地，要求根绝法西斯残余，建立一个和平的民主的独立的日本。
    总起来说，在所有尚未解放的殖民地和附属国里，妇女的首要和基本的任务，便是与全体人民紧紧的团结在一起，即在工人阶级的领导之下，团结农民阶级、小资产阶级、革命的知识分子及民族资产阶级，建立全民族的统一战线，坚持斗争，反对帝国主义及其走狗——本国的封建地主与买办资产阶级，以争取民族的彻底解放和人民民主政权的建立（这是妇女获得真正解放的前提）。
    在这里，我们愿意介绍一下我们中国人民取得胜利的经验，以供今天尚处在被压迫地位的兄弟姊妹的参考。我们中国人民之所以取得革命的胜利，首先是由于我们有了一个为正确的理论——马克思、列宁主义理论所武装的并且密切联系群众的中国共产党；其次我们结成了以共产党为领导的广大的民族统一战线，这个统一战线包括了工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、革命的知识分子和民族资产阶级。这就是说，一切反对帝国主义及其走狗的阶级、阶层、政党、团体和个人统统团结起来；最后，我们建设了强大的人民武装——人民解放军，坚持了武装斗争，以武装的人民打倒了武装的反革命。这就是中国人民胜利的道路，也就是许多殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族争取解放所应该走的道路。
    一方面，进行武装斗争，而在另一方面，在帝国主义和反动势力统治的城市和地区，我们善于和广大群众密切结合联系，把革命者和革命组织的非法的秘密的活动和人民群众的公开的合法的与非法的斗争划分清楚而又适当地联系起来，以便聚积强大的革命力量，等候时机的成熟，向帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治举行进攻。
    我们中国妇女得到解放的经验就是在中国历次革命中，我们中国妇女和中国人民总是团结在一起共同奋斗的。中国妇女运动是与民族解放运动密切结合在一起，并成为其组成的一部分。只有这样，妇女才能得到解放。否则我们就要陷于孤立而无所得。
    我们已经解放了的国家里的妇女的重要任务之一，便是要十分关心那些被压迫国家里姊妹们的痛苦，并且用一切的办法来支援她们的解放斗争。今天象印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、马来亚、菲律宾、伊朗这些国家里人民的斗争诚然是十分的艰苦，帝国主义者的统治还是很强，国内反动派的势力还是很猖獗。但是我们深信，今天世界上既然已经有了强大的社会主义的苏联，有了东欧新民主主义国家，有了空前强大的以苏联为首的世界和平民主陈营，有了蒙古、朝鲜、越南的，特别是中国人民的伟大胜利，东南亚及亚洲其他部分被压迫民族的解放斗争就决不会失败！暂时的挫折是会有的，但这只是黎明前的黑暗，春天前的寒冬。只要我们循着正确的道路，坚持团结，坚持斗争，熬过这一段黑夜，伟大的光明即将普照人间！我们应该千百倍的加强我们的胜利信心！
    其次，即使在人民已经获得了胜利或获得了基本胜利的国家，我们也还有许多重大而艰巨的工作在等待着我们去做。拿中国作比方吧，正如我们的英明领袖毛泽东主席所指出，我们今天的胜利还只是“万里长征走完了第一步”，放在我们面前的，是更艰巨的建设工作。同时帝国主义和反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们一定还要作最后挣扎，我们务必提高警惕。因此，我们中国妇女的任务，是继续和全中国人民一起，坚持团结，坚持人民民主专政，用千百倍的努力，来肃清国内的反革命残余势力，医治战争创伤，发展生产，开展文教，巩固国防，这样来建设一个独立的、民主的、统一的、富强的新中国，并且和全世界以苏联为首的一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结起来，共同为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    越南的妇女肩负着艰巨的任务，这就是和越南人民一起，把抗法的民族解放战争进行到底，彻底推翻法国帝国主义者及其傀儡政权的统治，解放全部国土，建设独立的幸福的越南民主共和国。
    朝鲜妇女和朝鲜人民的当前任务便是驱逐美帝国主义在朝鲜南部的侵略势力，为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的统一独立和民主建设而斗争。
    蒙古人民共和国的妇女的任务则是和全体人民一起，为更进一步提高国家的生产与文化水平而努力。
    苏联在亚细亚的共和国内妇女的任务，是和全苏联的妇女和人民一起，把她们社会主义的祖国建设得更好，更加千百倍地加强它的国防，因为苏联越是强大，世界和平就越有保障。亲爱的姊妹们：
    我们的任务是艰巨的，但是，依靠我们各民族人民自己的亲密团结，依靠我们各民族之间的国际团结，我们就一定能够获得胜利，并且将永远是胜利的。
    我们的斗争绝不是孤立的。强大的、一贯来同情被压迫民族解放斗争的苏联是和我们在一起，遍于全世界的爱好和平和自由的人民——工人、农民、知识分子、妇女、青年、是和我们在一起，以伟大的苏联为首的整个世界和平民主阵营是和我们在一起。我们的斗争就是全世界人民争取持久和平与人民民主的斗争的一部分。
    团结了五十九个国家八千一百万妇女的国际民主妇联一贯来给我们亚洲妇女的斗争以巨大的道义上的援助。它曾经派遣考察团访问了东南亚。在它的第二次国际代表大会（一九四八年十二月布达佩斯）上，它发出保卫世界和平的宣言，号召殖民地半殖民地的妇女加强她们反帝国主义、为民族独立与人民民主的斗争，号召美、英、法、荷的妇女反对她们政府所执行的帝国主义政策和所进行的殖民地战争。对于印度、伊朗等反动政府对妇女民主运动的镇压，她曾经不断提出抗议。而今天，也正是为了要声援亚洲妇女的斗争并且加强全世界民主妇女与亚洲妇女的团结，国际妇联才召集这个有历史意义的亚洲妇女代表大会。
    这种伟大的国际团结，极大地增加了我们斗争的力量和信心。它是我们获得胜利的有力保障。
    因此，为了争取我们全亚洲被压迫民族与被压迫妇女的解放，为了巩固我们已得的胜利，并取得更大的胜利，我们就必须和全世界一切受好和平的国家与人民更加亲密的团结起来，我们要坚决地拥护以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，拥护世界保卫和平大会。我们全亚洲的妇女要紧紧的团结在国际民主妇女联合会的旗帜之下，和全世界的民主妇女亲密携手共同奋斗，这样来争取世界持久和平、各民族的真正独立和人民的民主，而这也就是争取妇女的解放，和儿童的幸福前途。亲爱的姊妹们：
    历史已经宣判了帝国主义和反动派的死刑。让我们来执行这个判决吧！
    全亚洲以至全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民解放的时期已经来到了。让我们以无限胜利的信心和千百倍的努力来迎接这个伟大的时代吧。
    最后我们高呼：
    亚洲被压迫民族与被压迫妇女解放万岁！
    全世界民主妇女团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    国际民主妇联万岁！
