　　Long Live Stalin!
    Wang Yaping
    Call:
    Long Live Stalin! Long Live! Stalin!
    Long Live Stalin! Long Live! Stalin!
    The Chinese people salute you!
    Celebrating your great seventieth birthday!
    Chant:
    A forest appeared on the plain,
    Russia produced a giant of the world,
    If you ask his age and name,
    He is seventy years old this year, named Stalin.
    The mountains of the world grind against the sky,
    But cannot exceed his great achievements for the people;
    The oceans and seas of the world cannot be seen to the bottom,
    But are not as deep as his wisdom.
    The land in the world is connected to the sea, and the sea is connected to the land,
    His heart is closely connected to workers and peasants;
    We cannot compare the sun with him,
    Sometimes the sun is covered with dark clouds;
    We cannot compare the stars with him,
    The stars are too far away from us to be close;
    He was originally a teacher of the proletariat,
    Leading the working masses to reverse the history of the poor and turn themselves over.
    Stalin was born in a small town in Georgia,
    December 21, 1879, is his birthday,
    His father was a shoemaker in a factory,
    His mother was born the daughter of a serf, her background was really poor and bitter.
    He entered elementary school at the age of nine to learn to read,
    At the age of fifteen, he entered middle school to practice arithmetic, geography, and Russian,
    At this time, the Tsar ruled the country,
    The Tsar was originally a conspiratorial, poisonous, and tyrannical tyrant,
    He combined feudal local oppression of poor peasants,
    And colluded with capitalists to exploit workers,
    Directly causing the country to be filled with miasma,
    A few people get rich and enjoy happiness, while the working masses groan in poverty.
    At this time, Lenin took the lead in the revolution,
    To overthrow the Tsar's rule and eliminate the root of the disaster for the people,
    Lenin edited the Spark newspaper,
    To publicize the truth of Marxism to the people.
    Stalin came to see the Spark newspaper every day,
    He remembered every revolutionary truth clearly,
    At this time, he was only fifteen years old,
    He began to participate in the revolution and lead the workers,
    He regarded the workers as partners, as teachers,
    And learned combat knowledge and learning with the workers,
    He said that Lenin was like a heroic mountain eagle,
    The sound of the mountain eagle shook his heart.
    According to Lenin's instructions, he organized the working masses,
    And launched an earth-shaking struggle with the Tsarist rulers,
    The old feudal principal was anxious and afraid,
    And expelled Stalin, this "dangerous student",
    From then on, Stalin ran around making revolution,
    Leading the workers of the Caucasus to demonstrate and strike.
    They secretly held meetings in the black night,
    It was snowing and a strong wind was blowing outside,
    Stalin put his coat on a worker comrade,
    To prevent him from catching a cold and getting sick,
    The workers were grateful to him and united more closely,
    They all swore to be vanguards of the revolution,
    The revolutionary force is like a hurricane blowing big waves,
    And like the roaring thunder in June.
    After this, Stalin founded the Struggle Newspaper,
    He proclaimed that Lenin was the lighthouse of the proletariat,
    This lighthouse illuminated the black land of Russia,
    Under the lighthouse, workers and peasants formed a steel Great Wall,
    This Great Wall cannot be blown away by the wind or burned by fire,
    All because Marxism-Leninism is the savior of mankind.
    Stalin was active in the factory every day,
    Holding meetings, thinking of ways, determined to carry out the revolution,
    The first step was to unite the activists,
    And then slowly mobilize the surrounding workers and peasants,
    He educated the worker and peasant comrades to work harder and study,
    And regard Marxism-Leninism as the engine of the revolution.
    Soon the Communist Party had an organization,
    Openly and secretly launched a struggle,
    Like mountains and water, like raging fire, it broke out everywhere,
    In an instant, it spread to villages and county towns,
    The workers of Batumi were especially fierce and brave,
    And launched demonstrations and strikes one after another.
    The revolutionary force is like a prairie fire,
    The flames burn red in the sky,
    The Tsar could not sit still on his dragon throne,
    And issued an urgent order to arrest Stalin.
    Stalin was arrested and imprisoned,
    In prison, he continued the class struggle,
    Within ten years, he was imprisoned eight times,
    Entering and leaving prison, he continued to lead the workers and peasants,
    The Tsar's police and gendarmes hated him,
    And sent him to Siberia to suffer torture,
    During this time, he met Comrade Lenin,
    It was really a mountain eagle meeting a mountain eagle, a hero meeting a hero,
    The two of them jointly led the revolution,
    And fought against those reactionary guys.
    Slowly established revolutionary armed forces,
    To defeat the enemy, you must have both politics and guns,
    People say that the Red Army is like stars in the sky,
    Radiating endless light on the land of Russia,
    The red flag is embroidered with a sickle and hammer,
    The soldiers wear hats with red stars,
    This team is really invincible,
    All because the soldiers have learned Marxist-Leninist thought,
    They are not afraid to sacrifice and shed blood for the motherland and the people,
    In the end, they defeated the White Army and frightened the autocratic demons,
    Lenin and Stalin planned and led the overall situation,
    And faithfully implemented the resolutions and propositions of the Communist Party,
    Although the first revolution suffered a failure,
    The comrades' will became even stronger,
    This is like wrought iron that has been tempered thousands of times,
    It can only be turned into pure steel after going through the furnace.
    Sure enough, in October 1917,
    An armed uprising overthrew the autocratic Tsar,
    Moscow returned to the hands of the people,
    The red flag fluttered on the Kremlin,
    Victory was achieved within one day,
    The workers and peasants across the country were really overjoyed,
    All ethnic groups are treated completely equally,
    And a powerful Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established,
    Implement the dictatorship of the proletariat,
    To completely eliminate the internal and external bandits of the counter-revolution.
    At this time, the world is divided into two fronts,
    One side is autocratic dictatorship, and the other side is a bridge of democratic peace,
    Stalin attended the Communist International Conference,
    And exposed Trotsky's conspiracy,
    It is hateful that the reactionary guys are not dead,
    Colluding with the fascists to resist the revolutionary forces,
    Stalin led the Red Army to fight east and west,
    And also planned food supplies to maintain the Party Central Committee,
    Stalin went to the battlefield to command in person,
    Eliminated the White bandits and repelled the armed forces of imperialism.
    It is really the Red Army that has victories wherever it goes,
    Stalin's name is deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people,
    Once the revolution is successful, construction must begin,
    Promote science, culture, and consolidate national defense.
    Who would have thought that Comrade Lenin would suffer from a serious illness,
    The proletariat of the world seems to have lost their own mother,
    Stalin led the entire party to take an oath,
    To implement Marxism-Leninism and implement the propositions of the Communist Party,
    The first is to protect the purity and unity of the entire party,
    Just like protecting our own eyes,
    In order to completely and cleanly eliminate the enemy,
    We must also step up production and expand the armed forces of the Red Army.
    The first five-year plan was completed in four years,
    Massively developed industry and collective farms,
    Who wouldn't be happy that the productive forces have been liberated,
    The people have improved their lives, and the country has become prosperous and strong,
    The second and third five-year plans were launched one after another,
    Creating various machines and building huge factories,
    Tractors roll on the ground with a "pu＠＠" sound,
    Red and white chimneys stand tall on the river and hillsides,
    Workers, peasants, and all technicians work happily,
    Poets, painters, and writers all write and sing for the people,
    Stalin constantly called and lectured,
    To complete peaceful construction, we must pay even greater efforts.
    During this period, a big bad guy, the robber Hitler, emerged in Germany,
    He was determined to oppose communism and secretly plotted to attack the Soviet Union,
    Manufactured airplanes, artillery, warships, and tank teams,
    Mobilized more than three million fascist troops,
    And fiercely drove to the border of the Soviet Union,
    This day was exactly June 22nd,
    According to the world calendar, it was 1941,
    Hitler led the bandits to rush forward,
    妄想一口把苏联吃在肚里边；
    Stalin had prepared for national defense,
    And ordered the people of the whole country to mobilize together,
    All factories must produce for the war,
    To resist the enemy and break through this life and death hurdle,
    One by one, Red Army soldiers raised their hands and swore,
    They would never return alive if they did not repel Hitler,
    The peasants carried stretchers to transport grain and fodder,
    Women went to the front lines to rescue the wounded.
    Stalin's strategic thinking is really brilliant,
    He told the Red Army to preserve its strength and finally eliminate the enemy,
    He said: Hitler's ambition is really poisonous and cruel,
    He wants us to be his "slaves" and we cannot turn ourselves over,
    Don't look at him just occupying a little land at the beginning,
    Don't look at his bandit army entering the Ukrainian prairie,
    We have justice to fight for the love of our motherland,
    In the end, we will definitely make the enemy fall in front of us!
    The fierce fascist robbers were arrogant and complacent,
    And fought to the outskirts of Moscow, the capital, in four months,
    Stalin gave a speech in Red Square,
    No one can survive who wants to protect Moscow,
    How many talented heroes have been born in Russia,
    Wanting to attack is like climbing to the sky,
    The people and the Red Army are united like steel,
    To defend the capital, they bravely fought for the lead,
    Stalin ordered the Red Army to take the initiative to annihilate the enemy,
    Breaking Hitler's encirclement into pieces.
    The war lasted for a whole year,
    The Red Army gained the advantage and had the conditions for a counter-offensive,
    In July of the second year, Hitler
    Attacked the city walls of Stalingrad,
    Everyone knows about this city,
    This city is located in the bend of the Volga River,
    This city was originally called Tsaritsyn,
    Stalin defeated the White Army here and preserved the revolutionary forces,
    Therefore, the name was changed,
    In order to commemorate the victory for all time.
    This time Hitler came to attack this place again,
    管叫它自掘坟墓难以生还，
    Hitler's bandit army fought inside the city walls,
    The street fighting began, and the blood and fire raged to the sky,
    The Red Army insisted on resisting in the trenches,
    Killing and snatching every inch of soil and every brick,
    The will of the Red Army became stronger as they fought,
    The fascist bandits were a little bit terrified,
    The Red Army wrote letters to Stalin in the trenches,
    In order to defend this famous city, and not to stain Russian weapons!
    The battle lasted for days and nights,
    In the end, Hitler's bandit army was driven out of the city walls,
    Some were wiped out, some were taken prisoner,
    The remaining defeated army scurried away like rabbits.
    Stalin ordered to step up the chase,
    Mobilize millions of people to come to support together,
    The factories and farms in the rear stepped up production,
    Promoting the victorious war to the Rhine River,
    The people of the whole country responded to the leader's call,
    The Red Army launched a major counter-offensive in 1943,
    Hitler's bandit army lost its vitality,
    Defeat after defeat, there is no way to recover.
    The invincible Red Army liberated the vast territory,
    And guerrilla flames were ignited behind enemy lines,
    At this time, the second battlefield was opened up in Europe,
    The demon Mussolini also fell into the abyss of war,
    Hitler was isolated and difficult to cope with,
    The Soviet Red Army defeated Finland and attacked Poland,
    Romania also laid down its weapons,
    The Hungarian Empire was so frightened that it trembled,
    The Red Army spread out a long battle line,
    Four million troops pounced on the walls of Berlin,
    The soldiers shouted "Fight for Stalin",
    The solemn red flag fluttered on the Rhine River,
    The people of the entire Soviet Union celebrated the victory,
    Thanking Stalin's leadership for turning the world from danger to safety.
    Germany was liberated, and Japan also surrendered,
    Stalin's army liberated the Black River and the White Mountains,
    Mao Zedong led the Chinese people in combat,
    And quickly liberated North China and attacked the Central Plains,
    The land reform was implemented in the major liberated areas,
    Determined to eliminate the reactionary rule and the old feudal system,
    The People's Republic of China was established on October 1 this year,
    A great national victory is coming soon,
    Thank Lenin and Stalin for so much help,
    Thanks to the Red Army and the powerful peaceful fortress of the Soviet Union,
    "Follow the path of the Russians" - China is about to begin construction,
    How bright is the future of mankind!
    Comrade Stalin! Today is your seventieth birthday,
    You have fought for the revolution for fifty-five years,
    The highest mountain in the world cannot compare to your achievements,
    Your genius and wisdom are like the sea, you can't see the bottom,
    You are the most kind good friend of the Chinese people,
    The proletariat of the whole world is celebrating your birthday,
    Long live Stalin! Here we shout loudly,
    I hope this sound will quickly reach your ears,
    All 475 million people in China,
    Unanimously wish you good health! Wish you peace!
    Beijing, December 15, 1949.

　　万岁！斯大林！
    王亚平
    呼白：
    斯大林万岁！万岁！斯大林！
    斯大林万岁！万岁！斯大林！
    中国的人民向你敬礼！
    庆贺你伟大的七十寿辰！
    唱诗：
    平地上出现了一座森林，
    俄罗斯出了个世界的巨人，
    要问他的年龄和名姓，
    他今年七十岁，名叫斯大林。
    世界上的高山磨着天顶，
    却高不出他对人民的大功勋；
    世界上的大海大洋看不到底，
    却没有他的智谋那样深。
    世界上土地连着海水，海水连着土地，
    他的心紧连着工人和农民；
    咱不能把太阳和他来相比，
    有时候太阳也遮上了乌云；
    咱不能拿星斗和他来相比，
    星斗离咱们太远难以去亲近；
    他原是无产阶级的一个导师，
    领导着劳动大众扭转穷人的历史大翻身。
    斯大林生在乔治亚一个小城镇，
    一八七九年十二月二十一日是他的生辰，
    父亲是一个工厂的皮鞋匠，
    母亲是农奴的女儿出身实在苦贫。
    他九岁进小学开蒙认字，
    十五岁进中学演习算术、地理、还有俄文，
    这时节沙皇统治了全国，
    那沙皇原是个阴谋、毒竦、横行无理的暴君，
    他结合封建地方压迫贫雇农，
    又勾搭资本家剥削工人，
    直弄得全国上下乌烟瘴气，
    少数人发财享福工农大众在贫苦里呻吟。
    这时候有列宁领头起革命，
    要推翻沙皇的统治为人民铲掉祸根，
    这列宁主编了火星报纸，
    把马克思主义的道理宣传给人民。
    斯大林天天来看火星报，
    一条条革命的道理他记得清真，
    这时候他才年长一十五岁，
    就开始参加革命领导工人，
    他把工人当成了伙伴，当成了先生，
    和工人学习着战斗知识和学问，
    他说列宁好比是一只英勇的山鹰，
    山鹰的声音震动着他的心。
    依照列宁的指示组织起工农大众，
    和沙皇统治者展开了翻天覆地的斗争，
    校长老封建着急害了怕，
    开除了斯大林这个“危险的学生”，
    从此后斯大林东奔西走闹革命，
    领导高加索的工人示威罢工。
    黑夜晚他们秘密开会议，
    外面下着雪还刮着大风，
    斯大林把大衣给工人同志披在身上，
    免得他受风寒得了病症，
    工人们感激他团结得更紧，
    一齐地来宣誓做革命的先锋，
    革命的力量象狂风吹着大浪，
    又好比六月天轰轰的雷鸣。
    这以后斯大林创办了斗争报，
    他宣传列宁是无产阶级的灯塔，
    这灯塔照亮了俄罗斯的黑色土地，
    在灯塔下工农们结成了钢铁的长城，
    这长城风吹不散火烧不毁，
    都只为马列主义是人类的救星。
    斯大林在工厂天天活动，
    开会议、想办法、决心把革命推行，
    第一着团结了积极分子，
    再慢慢发动起四围的工农群众，
    他教育工农同志加劲儿学习，
    把马列主义当做革命的引擎。
    很快地共产党有了组织，
    公开的秘密的掀起了斗争，
    象山水、象烈火到处爆发，
    霎时间普遍到乡村和县城，
    巴士姆的工人尤其激烈英勇，
    接二连三地掀起了示威罢工。
    革命的势力好比燎原的烈火，
    这火焰直烧的满天通红，
    那沙皇坐不稳他的龙墩宝座，
    逮捕斯大林——下了一道紧急命令。
    斯大林被逮捕关进监狱，
    在监狱他依然进行阶级斗争，
    十年以内他坐过八回监狱，
    进监狱出监狱不息地领导工农，
    沙皇的警察宪兵把他怀恨，
    放他到西伯利亚尝受苦刑，
    这其间他会见了列宁同志，
    那真是山鹰会见了山鹰、英雄会见了英雄，
    两个人共同地领导革命，
    和那些反动的家伙进行斗争。
    慢慢地建立了革命的武装，
    要打垮敌人有政治还得有枪，
    人都说红军好比天上的星星，
    在俄国大地上放射着万丈光芒，
    红旗上绣制着镰刀锤子，
    战士们嵌戴了红星的帽章，
    这队伍真是百战百胜，
    都只因战士们学到了马列思想，
    为祖国为人民那个怕牺牲流血，
    到头来打垮了白军，吓倒了专制魔王，
    列宁、斯大林全盘的计划领导，
    忠诚地执行了共产党的决议主张，
    第一次的革命虽然遭到失败，
    同志们的意志越发地显得坚强，
    这正似千锤百炼的毛铁，
    经过了熔炉才能变成纯钢。
    果然在一九一七年的十月，
    武装起义推翻了专治的沙皇，
    莫斯科归还到人民之手，
    红旗在克里姆林宫上呼啦啦地飘扬，
    一天之内就获得了胜利，
    全国的工农大众真是欢喜欲狂，
    各族的人民完全平等看待，
    成立了强大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联邦，
    实行无产阶级专政，
    要彻底消灭反革命的内外匪帮。
    到此时，全世界分成两条战线，
    一边是专制独裁，一边是民主和平的桥梁，
    斯大林参加了共产国际会议，
    揭穿了托洛茨基的阴谋勾当，
    可恨那反动的家伙野心不死，
    勾结法西斯把革命的力量来反抗，
    斯大林领着红军东征西战，
    还一面筹划食粮维护党的中央，
    斯大林在战场亲去指挥，
    消灭了白匪军，打退了帝国主义的武装。
    这真是红军到那里那里就有胜利，
    斯大林的名字深印在人民的心上，
    革命成功了就得开始建设，
    发扬科学、文化，还要巩固国防。
    谁料想列宁同志遭一病不起，
    全世界的无产阶级象失去了自己的亲娘，
    斯大林领着全党举行宣誓，
    要贯彻马列主义实行共产党的主张，
    首先要保护全党的纯洁一致，
    就象保护自己的眼珠一样，
    为了彻底干净的消灭敌人，
    还得加紧生产扩大红军的武装。
    第一个五年计划四年完成，
    大量地发展了工业和集体农庄，
    生产力解放了谁不欢喜，
    人民改善了生活，国家变成了富强，
    第二、第三个五年计划接连的开展，
    创造了各样机器，建设了庞大的工厂，
    拖拉机在大地上扑＠＠地滚动，
    红色白色的烟囱高高地耸立在河边山岗，
    工人、农民、一切的技术家愉快地工作，
    诗人、画家、文学家都为人民来写作歌唱，
    斯大林不断地号召演讲，
    要完成和平建设还得付出更大的力量。
    这时期德国出了一个强盗希特勒大坏蛋，
    他一心反共暗算着进攻苏联，
    制造了飞机、大炮、战舰、坦克队，
    调动了法西斯军队三百多万，
    凶恶地开到了苏联的国境边，
    这一天正是六月二十二日，
    按世界公历是一九四一年，
    希特勒领着匪兵向前闯，
    妄想一口把苏联吃在肚里边；
    斯大林建设国防早有准备，
    向全国人民下令一齐动员，
    各工厂都要为战争生产，
    要抵抗敌人冲破生死这一关，
    有红军一个个举手宣誓，
    打不退希特勒决不生还，
    农民们抬担架运粮送草，
    妇女们到火线抢救伤员。
    斯大林的战略思想实英明，
    叫红军保存实力最后消灭敌人，
    他说：希特勒的野心真是毒狠，
    要叫咱给他当“奴隶”不能把身翻，
    别看他才开始占了一点土地，
    别看他的匪军开进了乌克兰草原，
    我们有正义为热爱祖国而战，
    到最后一定叫敌人倒在咱的面前！
    凶狠的法西斯强盗骄横自满，
    四个月打到了莫斯科的京城边，
    斯大林在红场发表谈话，
    保住莫斯科谁也不能存心苟安，
    俄罗斯出生过多少天才英雄，
    妄想来进攻那好比登天还难，
    人民、红军团结成钢铁一般，
    为了保卫京城一个个奋勇争先，
    斯大林命令红军争取主动歼灭敌人，
    把希特勒的包围冲了个七零八散。
    这战争进行了一年整，
    红军变成优势有了反攻的条件，
    希特勒在第二年的七月，
    进攻到斯大林格勒的城头边，
    提起这座城人人知晓，
    这座城座落在窝尔加的河湾，
    这座城原来的名字叫察里津，
    斯大林在这里打败白军把革命的力量保全，
    因此上才改了这个名字，
    为的是纪念胜利万古流传。
    这一回希特勒又来进攻此地，
    管叫它自掘坟墓难以生还，
    希特勒的匪军打到城墙以内，
    巷战开始了，直杀的血火燎天，
    红军在战壕坚持抵抗，
    杀来抢去夺着一寸土和一块砖，
    红军的意志越战越坚强，
    法西斯匪军心里有点胆寒，
    红军在战壕给斯大林写信，
    为了保卫这座名城，不叫俄罗斯的武器染上污斑！
    这战斗坚持了几天又几夜，
    到最后把希特勒匪军赶出了城垣，
    有的被消灭，有的当了俘虏，
    剩下的败军象兔子都窜了烟。
    斯大林下命令加紧追赶，
    发动千百万的人民一齐来支援，
    后方的工厂、农场加紧生产，
    把胜利的战争推进到莱茵河边，
    全国人民响应领袖的号召，
    红军大举反攻就在一九四三年，
    希特勒匪军丧尽了元气，
    打一仗败一仗没有啥法子再复原。
    无敌的红军光复了广大的国土，
    在敌人后方又燃起了游击的火焰，
    这时候欧洲开辟了第二战场，
    魔鬼黑索里尼也败倒在战争的深渊，
    希特勒孤立了，难以应战，
    苏联红军战胜了芬兰又进攻到波兰，
    罗马尼亚也放下了武器，
    匈牙利帝国直吓得乱打颤颤，
    这红军排开了长大的战线，
    四百万大军扑向了柏林城垣，
    战士们高呼着“为斯大林而战”，
    庄严的红旗飘扬在莱茵河边，
    全苏联的人民庆祝胜利，
    感谢斯大林的领导把世界转危为安。
    德国解放了，日本也投了降，
    斯大林的军队解放了黑水白山，
    毛泽东领导着中国人民作战，
    很快地解放了华北又进攻中原，
    各大解放区实行了土地改革，
    决心要消灭反动统治和老封建，
    今年十月一日成立了中华人民共和国，
    全国大胜利就临到眼前，
    感谢列宁、斯大林给我们多少帮助，
    感谢红军和强大的和平堡垒苏联，
    “走俄国人的路”——中国要开始建设，
    人类的前途是多么光辉灿烂！
    斯大林同志！今天你七十大庆，
    为革命你战斗了五十五年，
    世界上最高的高山比不过你的功勋高，
    你的天才、智谋象大海望不到底看不到边，
    你是中国人民最亲切的好朋友，
    全世界的无产阶级都为你祝寿狂欢，
    万岁！斯大林！在这里我们高声呼喊，
