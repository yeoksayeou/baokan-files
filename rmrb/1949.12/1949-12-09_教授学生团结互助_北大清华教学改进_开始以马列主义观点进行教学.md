　　Professors and Students Unite and Help Each Other
  　Peking University and Tsinghua University Improve Teaching
  　Teaching Begins with Marxist-Leninist Perspectives
    [Report from this newspaper] In the past two months of this semester, Peking University and Tsinghua University have initially implemented the New Democratic education policy, making considerable improvements in teaching methods, teacher-student relations, and course content.

    With the strengthening of vocational studies, the study of political courses "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" (required for all departments) and "Political Economy" (required for liberal arts colleges) has been widely launched in both universities. The universities have divided students into more than 200 small groups and more than 20 large classes (each university has more than 2,000 students). Teachers give keynote speeches in large classes, small groups hold informal discussions, and teachers summarize large class discussions. Many professors participated in political study (85% of professors in the Peking University Faculty of Arts participated). Many professors, through political study, negated or criticized their past viewpoints and the subjects they taught, and intensified their study of Marxist-Leninist theory to reform the courses they taught. However, some students believe that they are already willing to serve the people and no longer need political study, preferring to spend more time studying their specialties. Therefore, there is some relaxation in the current political study, but this phenomenon has begun to be corrected.

    The course content of various departments in the two universities has been initially improved. The liberal arts colleges have opened new courses in Marxist-Leninist theory, but some course names are new, while the content remains the same, requiring continuous improvement and enrichment. A few courses have further incorporated Marxist-Leninist ideological education. For example, Professor Pei Wenzhong explains geology from the perspective of dialectical materialism. Professor Zhang Ren of the Hydraulic Engineering Group of Peking University's Faculty of Engineering used to quote the Mississippi River and the Suez Canal when teaching hydraulics, but now he has begun to relate it to harnessing the Yellow River, preventing drought, and irrigating farmland. He also led students to attend the National Water Conservancy Conference and distributed articles on water conservancy published in the People's Daily for students to study together. When Professor You Guoen of the Chinese Department of Peking University lectured on the history of Chinese literature, he first explained the historical background of the literature of each era from the perspective of historical materialism, then discussed the main literary trends that arose from it, and finally listed representative figures to specifically illustrate the literary features of each era.

    Academic research has begun to connect with practice and cooperate with construction. In the past, university research work mostly stayed in the laboratory, isolated from practical work. Now, for example, the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University is undertaking the design of the new urban area in the western suburbs of Beijing, and also designed and renovated the Huairentang and Yingtai in Zhongnanhai; the materials testing laboratory of the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University inspects the quality and identifies the performance of various steels, machine parts, and wood for factories in Northeast China, North China, and other places; and the teachers and students of the Department of Civil Engineering also actually participated in the surveying work of the Hunhe irrigation area in Northeast China and the new urban area in Beijing.

    Teacher-student relations and teaching methods have also been improved in both universities. Under the principle of "teachers and students helping each other and learning from each other" of the Ministry of Education, most departments and classes in the two universities held teacher-student symposiums at the beginning of this semester, reviewed the abnormal relationship of teacher-student antagonism or indifference in the past, and launched sincere criticism and self-criticism. Some departments, such as the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University, will hold such symposiums regularly in the future, while others, such as the Mechanical Engineering Department of Peking University's Faculty of Engineering, will regularly visit professors. Professors from the Faculty of Engineering of Tsinghua and Peking University come to students' dormitories to understand their learning situation. The vast majority of professors have broken away from the past teaching methods of only focusing on teaching and not asking about the results, and actively solicit students' opinions on teaching, understand the difficulties and key points of students' learning, and conduct lectures in a targeted, focused, and systematic manner. Professor Zhang Wei, a professor of mechanics at the Faculty of Engineering of Tsinghua University, inspires students from both positive and negative perspectives when lecturing, and often connects with the basic laws of mechanics, making this subject, which has always been regarded as the most difficult by students, easy to accept. Cooperation among professors is also a factor in promoting teaching improvement. The political science course offered by the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Peking University is collectively divided by four professors, who try to explain it from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, each responsible for a part. Before class, they discuss and supplement materials with each other, propose teaching focuses, and after class, they improve teaching methods based on student feedback. This makes the course content richer as teaching progresses.

    The organization of study and life is also one of the new features of Peking University and Tsinghua University this year. Sweeping away the free and loose atmosphere of the past, students are organized by department and class. Dormitories and dining halls are allocated positions by department and class to ensure the organization of life. In terms of study, the organization is even more rigorous. In a class at Peking University, there are mutual learning groups, which are the basic units for political and vocational studies. Student representatives at the department level, teaching assistant representatives, and the department director jointly form a teaching committee to lead the teaching of the department. In Tsinghua University, the study organization is relatively sound. For example, in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, there are three types of study organizations in the class: mutual assistance, seminar, and teaching. Three or four people form a mutual assistance group, which is often also a living group. They live, eat, and study together, and are the basic unit of a class. Three or four mutual assistance groups form a large group as a unit for political study. Each large group selects learning representatives from several major courses in the class to form a seminar group, which is responsible for collecting questions raised by each mutual assistance group, conducting preliminary research and answers, and submitting unresolved questions to teachers. Representatives of the seminar groups of each major course, together with professors and teaching assistants, form a teaching group to solve problems, adjust the learning ratio of each course, exchange teaching experience, check teaching plans, and promptly point out and correct biases in learning, so as to specifically grasp the progress of teaching in a class.

　　教授学生团结互助
  　北大清华教学改进
  　开始以马列主义观点进行教学
    【本报讯】北京大学与清华大学，本学期两个多月的学习，初步执行了新民主主义的教育方针，在教学方法，师生关系，课程内容等方面有了不少的改进。
    随着务业学习的加强，两校政治课程“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论”（各院系必修）与“政治经济学”（文法学院必修）的学习普遍展开，两校分别将学生分为两百多小组和二十多个大班（北大、清华学生均为二千余人），教员上大课作启发报告，小组漫谈讨论，大班讨论由教员作总结，许多教授参加了政治学习（北大文学院有百分之八十五的教授参加），不少教授通过政治学习否定或批判了过去的观点和所教的业务，并加紧学习马列主义理论来改革所教的课程。但有部分学生认为自己已经愿意为人民服务了，就不再需要政治学习，而愿意将更多的时间学习业务，因此在目前的政治学习中存在部分松弛现象，但此种现象目前已开始得到纠正。
    两校各院系课程内容已有了初步的改进。文法学院新开了马列主义的理论课程，但有一部分课程名称虽新，内容仍旧，需要不断的改进、充实内容。有少数课程则已进一步结合了马列主义的思想教育。如裴文中教授以辩证唯物论的观点讲解地质学，北大工学院水利组教授张任以前讲水利课时多引用密西西比河和苏伊士运河等，现在则开始联系到治黄，防旱，农田灌溉等，并率领学生旁听全国水利会议，印发人民日报所载有关水利的文章与学生一起学习。北大中文系教授游国恩讲中国文学史时以唯物史观的方法先说明每一时代文学的时代背景，再论述所由发生的文艺主流，最后列举代表人物以具体说明每一时代的文学面貌。
    学术研究开始联系实际，配合建设。过去大学研究工作多停留于实验室内，孤立于实际工作之外。现在如清华营建学系担任了北京市西郊新市区建设工作的设计，又设计改建了中南海的怀仁堂瀛台；清华土木系的材料试验室为东北、华北等地工厂的各种钢铁，机器零件，木材等检验品质，辨别性能；土木系师生并实际参加了东北浑河灌溉区和北京市新市区的测量工作。
    两校师生关系和教学方法也都有改进。在教育部的“师生互助，教学相长”的原则下，本学期开始时两校大部分系班召开了师生座谈会，检讨了过去师生对立或漠不相关的不正常的关系，展开了诚恳的批评与自我批评。有的系级如清华中文系今后将经常举行此等座谈会，有的如北大工学院机械系定期访问教授，清华，北大工学院的教授到学生宿舍来了解学生的学习情况。绝大多数教授则打破过去只顾耕耘不问收获的教书方式，主动征求学生对于教学的意见，了解学生学习的疑难关键，有的放矢地，有重点有系统地进行讲解。清华工学院教授力学的张维教授，讲解时从正反多方面启发，经常联系力学的基本法则，使这门素来被学生视为最困难的力学，达到了易于接受的地步。教授间的合作也是促使教学改进的因素之一，北大法学院政治系所开政治学由四个教授集体分工，尝试以马列主义的观点进行讲解，每人负责一部分，上课前互相讨论，补充材料，提出教授重点，课后又根据学生的反映，改善教学方法，这样使课程内容随教学进展而愈见丰富。
    学习和生活的组织化，也为今年北大清华两校新气象之一。一扫过去自由散漫的风气，学生按系级组织了起来。宿舍及膳厅中均按系级为单位分配位置，保证生活的组织化。学习方面，组织更为严密。北大一班中有学习互助小组，为政治学习及业务学习的基本单位。系级的学生代表，讲助代表与系主任共组成教学委员会，领导一系教学的进行。有清华，学习组织较健全的如理工学院的班中有互助、研讨和教学等三种学习组织。三人或四人组成互助小组，常常同时即是生活小组，住宿、吃饭、学习都在一起，为一班的基本单位。三个或四个互助小组组成大组为政治学习的单位，每一大组中推出该班几门主要课程的学习代表组成研讨小组，负责收集各互助小组所提的题目，初步研究解答，不能解决者提给教员。各主要课程的研讨小组派出代表会同教授，助教等组成教学小组，解决问题，调整各门课程学习比重，交流教学经验，检查教学计划，及时指出并纠正学习中的偏向，具体掌握一班教学的进行。
