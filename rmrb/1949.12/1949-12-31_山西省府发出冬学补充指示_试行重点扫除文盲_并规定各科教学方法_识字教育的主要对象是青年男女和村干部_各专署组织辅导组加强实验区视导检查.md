　　[This Newspaper News] In order to further promote the Winter Studies movement, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government recently issued supplementary instructions on Winter Studies. The instructions first pointed out that literacy education should focus on young men and women aged fourteen to twenty-five and village cadres, with the aim of gradually eliminating illiteracy. Organizational forms should be diverse according to the needs and willingness of the masses, and should not be forced into uniformity; but they must be graded according to different levels, and the "one-size-fits-all" learning organization is opposed. The proportion of course content: in the old areas, cultural, scientific, health, and production technology education accounts for 50%; central work (ideological education on production work and education on people's representatives conferences) and current affairs and political education accounts for 50%. In the new areas, land reform and emancipation, production policies, and current affairs and political education account for 70% to 80%, in order to improve the class consciousness of the peasants; science, health, and literacy education account for 20% to 30%.
　　Second, teaching methods for each subject: political classes mainly rely on the dissemination stations established by the district, with special personnel sent by the county to teach on a regular basis, not only teaching the content of the course, but also teaching how to combine with the masses' thinking, to enlighten and guide, and to criticize problems. Discussions should be conducted in groups in class, and the difficult questions raised by the masses must be studied by the dissemination station before being answered in a unified way. Production and health classes should be combined with the actual life of the masses, linked to existing experience, and conducted using the method of discussion and comparison, so that the experience of the masses can be raised to a scientific level. Literacy classes should use flashcards, rotation, object recognition, family blackboards, writing imitations, keeping diaries, reading newspapers, and practical writing and other repeated practice methods according to different levels and different organizational forms.
　　Third, pilot projects for key illiteracy eradication. Each special district can designate experimental counties or experimental districts, and counties can delineate key villages. The conditions for selecting key areas are: 1. There is a foundation for the work; 2. There is a foundation for Winter Studies and people's schools; 3. The masses have high learning requirements; 4. Leading cadres are relatively strong. The main target of illiteracy eradication is young people aged fourteen to twenty-five, but we will not relax our efforts to help adults who want to learn. When the work is carried out, the first thing to do is to investigate illiteracy; secondly, mobilize all men and women of the specified age to participate (but oppose the use of coercive orders); then divide into classes and groups, and adopt different literacy textbooks for different levels; it is best to have one textbook per person. It is also necessary to establish and improve the Winter Studies Committee and various teaching systems—classes, tests, leave, rewards and punishments, etc. Strive for concentration during learning. In addition, it is necessary to closely cooperate with primary schools, use young teachers and family blackboards to promote the learning of illiteracy in the homes of students; pay attention to absorbing enthusiastic intellectuals in the countryside to participate in the Winter Studies Committee.
　　Leadership of key villages must be strengthened, and timely inspection and guidance should be carried out, solving funding problems, helping teachers teach, and paying attention to training teachers. In the process of work, various experiences and problems must be disseminated to various places in a timely manner using newsletters or small newspapers, and inspections and summaries should be made at a certain stage.
　　Fourth, in order to strengthen the leadership of Winter Studies, the education departments of each special district should absorb personnel from relevant departments to participate in the organization of Winter Studies guidance groups to strengthen supervision and inspection of experimental areas; each county should select trained teachers to form guidance groups and assign them to work in various villages. County and district cadres stationed in districts and key villages should be the natural counselors of Winter Studies, and must consciously cooperate with the principals of central schools and Winter Studies teachers to organize competitions, hold small observation and discussion meetings, etc. in villages near the key villages to exchange experiences and promote work in a timely manner.
　　Each special county should have at least two guidance sessions during the Winter Studies movement, one comprehensive guidance after the start of school, and one in-depth key inspection before the lunar New Year. Before departure, the guidance group should study the work in detail, formulate a plan, and the experience in the guidance should be summarized and promoted in a timely manner.
　　In addition, the special county guidance group should promptly discover and reward model Winter Studies programs, model teachers, students, or cadres, etc., and can adopt oral rewards, circular commendations, general commendations, issuing certificates or funds, etc., and should make it a mass reward. During the Winter Studies summary, each county should hold a model selection movement to lay a certain foundation for future regular people's schools.

　　山西省府发出冬学补充指示
  　试行重点扫除文盲
　  并规定各科教学方法
    识字教育的主要对象是青年男女和村干部
    各专署组织辅导组加强实验区视导检查
    【本报讯】山西省人民政府为进一步推进冬学运动，于日前发出冬学补充指示。指示首先指出：识字教育应着重在十四岁至二十五岁的青年男女和村干部，以逐步消灭文盲为目的。组织形式应根据群众需要与自愿，采取多种多样形式，不必强求一致；但须按不同程度分级，反对一搅子的学习组织。课程内容的比重：在老区，文化、科学、卫生与生产技术教育共占百分之五十；中心工作（生产工作的思想教育与人代会教育）与时事、政治教育共占百分之五十。在新区，土改翻身、生产政策与时事政治教育占百分之七十至八十，以提高农民阶级觉悟；科学卫生与识字教育占百分之二十至三十。
    第二，各科教学方法：政治课主要依靠区设立之传授站，由县派专人按期传授，不仅传授课程内容，并应传授如何结合群众思想，以启发诱导、针对问题予以批判等方法进行教学。讨论会应在当堂分组进行，群众提出的疑难问题，须经传授站研究后，再予统一解答。生产和卫生课，应结合群众生活实际，联系已有经验，用座谈对比的方法进行，使群众经验提高到科学水平上来。识字课应按照不同程度和不同的组织形式，运用卡片、轮回、指物识字、家庭黑板、写仿、记日记、读报与应用文等反复练习的方法进行。
    第三，试行有重点的扫除文盲。各专署可指定实验县或实验区、县划定重点村。选择重点地区的条件是：一、工作有基础；二、冬学、民校有基础；三、群众的学习要求高；四、领导干部比较强。扫除文盲的主要对象是十四岁到廿五岁的青年，但也不放松有学习要求的壮年。工作进行时，首先要调查文盲；其次动员全部规定年龄的男女参加（但反对用强迫命令方式）；再划班编组，不同程度采用不同识字课本；课本最好每人一册。并须建立与健全冬学委员会以及各种教学制度——上课、测验、请假、奖惩等。学习时力求集中。此外，必须密切配合小学，运用小先生和家庭黑板等推动学生家中文盲学习；注意吸收热心教育的在乡知识分子参加冬学委会。
    对于重点村的领导必须加强，及时检查与指导，解决经费问题，帮助教员教学，注意培养教员。工作进行中，须及时将各种经验及问题，利用通报或小报等形式传播各地，并在一定阶段上作出检查总结来。
    第四，为加强冬学领导，各专署教育部门应吸收有关部门人员参加组织冬学辅导小组，加强实验区的视导检查；各县应抽调已轮训的教员组成辅导组，分派各村工作。驻区和驻基点村的县区干部，应为冬学的当然辅导员，须有意识的配合中心学校校长、冬学教员，在基点村附近村庄组织竞赛，举行小型观摩与座谈会等及时交流经验推动工作。
    各专县在冬学运动中，至少要有两次辅导，开学后作一次全面的辅导，阴历年前作一次深入重点检查。辅导组在出发前，应详细研究工作，订出计划，辅导中的经验，应及时总结推广。
    此外，专县辅导组应及时发现与奖励模范冬学、模范教员、学员或干部等，可采用口头奖励、通报表扬、通令嘉奖、发给奖状或资金等形式，并应使之成为群众性的奖励。各县在冬学总结时，应举行评选模范运动，以为今后的经常民校打下一定基础。
