Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th – Representatives of the mutinied employees of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), and the former National Resources Commission (NRC) in Hong Kong jointly hosted Hong Kong reporters at the Dahua Hotel on the morning of December 2nd. They issued a solemn statement denouncing the reactionary newspapers' fabricated rumors that the Kuomintang gangster clique had taken over the CATC and former NRC institutions in Hong Kong. Before the press conference, the CATC Extraordinary Committee guided reporters to visit the company's offices and airport to demonstrate that all the company's institutions were still operating as usual, and that there were no puppet government personnel. The joint statement said: Regarding the property of the former NRC, offices, houses, showrooms, and safes not used by the mutinied employees have been sealed. All employees are determined to protect national property to the end and smash the Kuomintang gangster clique's "takeover" conspiracy. The news that the so-called CATC puppet "General Manager" Dai Anguo "took over" is completely untrue. All personnel loyal to the Beijing Central People's Government are now continuing to perform the sacred task of guarding the people's property with the utmost attention. CNAC's work of guarding aircraft and equipment is continuing until it is safe to resume the establishment of Chinese air transport work.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th – The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions and 46 other workers' organizations, representing all workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, recently sent a letter to the mutinied employees of the China National Aviation Corporation, Central Air Transport Corporation, and the former National Resources Commission, guaranteeing their support for their struggle to protect the property of the people and the motherland until final victory. The letter said: Your mutiny is entirely in line with the interests of the entire Chinese people and the will of the entire Chinese people, and it also demonstrates the high patriotic spirit of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, so it can be actively supported by all patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. With the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon as your backing, you should have even greater courage to fight against the bandits who attempt to plunder the property of the people and the motherland. The letter also said: Your primary task now is to strengthen unity, not allowing anyone to be shaken by the coercion and inducement of the reactionaries, and you must maintain the glory of the mutiny and persevere to the end. As long as you are united, the reactionaries are doomed to failure. The letter finally assured the mutinied employees: We, the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, will definitely support you, and this is our unshirkable duty. If the reactionaries dare to plunder the property of the people and the motherland, we believe that all patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon will also be able to unite and resolutely protect the property of the people and the motherland and smash the plunder conspiracy of the reactionaries!
