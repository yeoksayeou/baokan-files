Beijing Cracks Major Espionage Case
Ringleader Cao Wenjun and Accomplices All Arrested
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Public Security Bureau cracked a major Kuomintang bandit espionage organization, the pseudo "North China Volunteer Army," on November 27th, arresting ten special agent bandits including the pseudo commander-in-chief Cao Wenjun. As early as June of last year, Cao Wenjun, the chief secretary of the Kuomintang special agent pseudo "Shanxi Baking Furnace Training Committee" (a special agent training organization), was secretly ordered by the special agent boss Liang Huazhi to come to Beijing with a large amount of operational funds to arrange espionage work. After arriving in Beijing on August 14th of last year, the suspect contacted Lu Zian, a special agent from the pseudo Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters' Beijing Office. Lu ordered the suspect to seize the opportunity to conduct activities after the liberation of Beijing. After the liberation of Beijing, the suspect set up a stall to sell grain as a cover on Mashi Street and West Huangcheng Root, secretly organizing the pseudo "North China Volunteer Army," and appointed himself as the commander-in-chief. He formed four brigades from the Kuomintang stragglers and fleeing landlords he had colluded with, appointing Yang Shixian as the commander of the first brigade, Lu Zimin as the commander of the second brigade, Yang Delin as the commander of the third brigade, and Xing Zixi as the commander of the fourth brigade. Wang Shouxin, Xie Rubin, Ding Qingyun, Zheng Wenhua, Zhao Mingshan, and others were appointed as the captains of the various brigades. They conspired to develop reactionary organizations and carry out sabotage activities. After investigation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, on November 27th, when the suspect and others were contacting the Kuomintang bandits for espionage work and receiving operational funds, and Cao was about to secretly go to Chongqing to find the pseudo Executive Yuan President Yan Xishan, he was arrested in Tianjin and escorted back to Beijing. According to the suspect's confession, the other principal and accessory offenders, including Yang Shixian, were arrested on November 30th, and a radio station parts and related documents were seized on the spot. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is currently under investigation.
