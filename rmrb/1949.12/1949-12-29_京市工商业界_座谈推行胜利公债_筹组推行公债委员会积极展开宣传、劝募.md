[Beijing News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce convened forums for the heads of various trade associations to discuss how to promote the People's Victory Indexed Bonds. It was also decided to establish an industrial and commercial bond promotion committee in the coming days to actively carry out publicity and solicitation work. The first symposium was held yesterday (28th), attended by the heads of 24 trade associations, including rice and flour, mechanized flour, leather making, rubber, and banking, as well as Fu Huating and Sun Fuling, chairman and vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and 26 others. The speeches at the meeting were enthusiastic. It was unanimously agreed that the issuance of bonds could make up for a portion of the fiscal deficit, strive for the stability of currency value and prices, which is not only good for people's lives, but also more conducive to the development of industry and commerce. In order to support the War of Liberation and assist the government in overcoming financial difficulties, the task of purchasing bonds should be mainly borne by the industrial and commercial circles. Liu Yifeng of the Chinese medicine industry made a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of issuing bonds and issuing currency. He said: "It is better to issue bonds than to issue more currency. If the currency inflates, prices will inevitably rise, and the people will suffer losses. However, the issuance of bonds does not mean that it is completely unnecessary to issue more currency, but bonds can withdraw currency, and prices will naturally be relatively stable." Sun Fuling of the mechanized flour industry cited three reasons to illustrate that the industrial and commercial circles should actively subscribe to bonds. He said: "Bonds are indexed to actual value. Buying bonds can not only guarantee the principal, but also provide interest. The creditworthiness is absolutely reliable. Minister Bo Yibo reported that the government's budget for next year includes one percent for the repayment of principal and interest on Northeast bonds." Li Yizan of the dairy industry said: In the past, the burden of the War of Liberation was mostly borne by farmers. Now that large cities have been liberated, industry and commerce should actively purchase bonds to bear part of the national expenditure. Qin Zhibu of the banking industry said: "There is no loss in using idle funds to buy bonds, because bonds are calculated according to actual value. Buying bonds is equivalent to increasing one's own materials, and it is also equivalent to increasing social materials. Everyone works together to stabilize prices." Fu Huating summarized the speeches of more than ten people and said: We have a clear understanding of the issuance of bonds. We should earnestly explain to those who still have doubts and concerns. We must set an example and strive to subscribe first. This is the glorious task of our industry and commerce. Do not shirk responsibility and be sure to work hard to complete it. Finally, it was decided to organize an industrial and commercial bond promotion committee with the attendees as initiators to carry out publicity and fundraising, and Shi Jinkui, Zhang Xianting and other nine people were appointed as drafters to draft the organization and work plan of the bond promotion committee, and a formal organization will be established in the coming days. Also: The second and third symposia are scheduled to be held this afternoon and tomorrow morning (29th). Today, the heads of 64 industries such as matches and printing will attend. Tomorrow (30th), the heads of 62 industries such as silk and satin and hotels will be convened for discussion.

　　京市工商业界
    座谈推行胜利公债
    筹组推行公债委员会积极展开宣传、劝募
    【北京讯】京市工商业联合会筹备委员会为讨论怎样推行人民胜利折实公债，分别召集各行业公会负责人举行座谈；并决定日内成立工商业推行公债委员会，积极展开宣传、劝募工作。昨（二十八）日首次举行座谈会，到有米面粮、机制面粉、制革、橡胶、银钱等二十四行业公会负责人及工商业联合会筹委会主任委员傅华亭、孙孚凌等二十六人。会上发言热烈，一致认为：发行公债可以弥补一部分财政赤字，争取币值和物价的稳定，不但对人民生活有好处，而且更有利于发展工商业。为了支援解放战争，协助政府克服财政困难，购买公债的任务，主要应由工商界担负起来，国药业刘一峰对发行公债发行通货的利弊作一比较，他说：“发行公债比多发通货好，通货膨胀物价必然跟着上涨，人民就要蒙受损失。但发行公债并不是说就可完全不必再发通货，不过公债能使通货回笼，物价自然相对的稳定。”机制面粉业孙孚凌举出三点理由说明工商业界应踊跃认购公债，他说：“公债是折实的，买公债既可以保本，又有利息，债信更绝对可靠，薄一波部长报告政府明年支出概算中就列入百分之点一是作东北公债还本付息用的。”牛羊乳业李贻赞说：解放战争的负担过去多是由农民负担，现在大城市都解放了，工商业应踊跃购买公债担负国家一部分开支。银钱业秦芝圃说：“拿游资买公债并无损失，因为公债是折实计算，买了公债等于自己增加了物资，也等于社会增加了物资，大家合力平抑物价。”傅华亭总结十余人的发言说：我们对发行公债已有了清楚认识，对仍然有怀疑有顾虑的应认真给予解释，我们要以身作则，争先认购，这是我们工商业的光荣任务，不要推诿，一定要努力完成。最后决定以当场出席人为发起人，组织工商业界推行公债委员会，进行宣传劝募，并推定石金奎、张献庭等九人为起草人，草拟推行公债委员会的组织和工作计划，日内成立正式机构。又：第二、三次座谈会定今（二十九日）日分上下午举行，今天出席的有火柴、印刷等六十四行业负责人，明（三十）日将召集绸缎、旅店等六十二行业负责人座谈。
