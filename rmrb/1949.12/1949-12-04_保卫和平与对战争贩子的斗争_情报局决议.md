　　Defend Peace and Fight Against the Warmongers
  　Information Bureau Resolution
    After discussing the report "Defend Peace and Fight Against the Warmongers", the representatives of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Romanian Workers' Party, the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik), the French Communist Party, the Italian Communist Party, and the Czechoslovak Communist Party unanimously concluded as follows:
    The events of the past two years have fully confirmed the correctness of the analysis of the international situation made by the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau at its first meeting in September 1947.
    During this period, the two lines of world policy have become clearer and sharper: one is the line of the democratic, anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is carrying out a resolute and consistent struggle for peace among nations and for democracy; the other is the line of the imperialist, anti-democratic camp headed by the ruling circles of the United States, whose main purpose is to forcibly establish Anglo-American world hegemony, enslave other countries and peoples, destroy democracy, and launch a new war.
    Furthermore, the aggressive nature of the imperialist camp is continuing to grow, and the ruling groups of the United States and Britain are openly pursuing a policy of aggression and preparation for a new war.
    The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism have grown in number and strength in the struggle against imperialism and the war camp.
    The further strengthening of the power of the Soviet Union; the political and economic consolidation of the People's Democratic countries and the fact that they have embarked on the road of building socialism; the historic victory of the Chinese People's Revolution over the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and American imperialism; the establishment of the German Democratic Republic; the consolidation of the Communist Parties in various countries; the growth of democratic movements in various capitalist countries; and the huge scale of the movement for peace—all these indicate the considerable expansion and consolidation of the anti-imperialist, democratic camp.
    At the same time, the imperialist anti-democratic camp is becoming weaker and weaker. The success of the democratic and socialist forces, the maturing economic crisis, the further intensification of the general crisis of capitalism, and the intensification of external and internal contradictions of the capitalist system are all clear evidence of the increasing weakness of imperialism.
    The change in the international balance of power in favor of the peace and democracy camp has aroused the fury of the imperialist warmongers.
    The Anglo-American imperialists hope to use war to change the course of historical development, to solve their external and internal contradictions and difficulties, to consolidate the position of capital, and to achieve world domination.
    The imperialists know that time is not on their side, and they are frantically rushing to plot various groups and alliances of reactionary forces to realize their aggressive plans.
    The entire plan of the Anglo-American imperialist group is aimed at preparing for a new war. This is manifested in: obstructing the peaceful settlement of relations with Germany and Japan; completing the dismemberment of Germany; turning the western occupied areas of Germany and Japan under American occupation into centers of fascism and revenge and springboards for the realization of the group's aggressive plans.
    Serving this policy is the harsh Marshall Plan and its direct successor, the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Military Alliance, aimed at opposing all peace-loving people; the unbridled arms race between the United States and Western European countries; the continuous expansion of military budgets and the expansion of the network of American military bases.
    This policy is also manifested in the Anglo-American group's refusal to ban atomic weapons, despite the myth of American atomic monopoly having been swept away, and in their use of all methods to instigate war hysteria.
    This policy determines the entire line of the Anglo-American group in the United Nations Organization, the purpose of which is to sabotage the United Nations Organization and turn it into a weapon of American monopoly capital.
    The imperialists' policy of launching a new war is also manifested in the conspiracy exposed in the Rajk-Brankov trial in Budapest, which was organized by the Anglo-American group with the help of the fascist nationalist Tito group, which has become a running dog of international imperialist reactionaries, in order to oppose the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union.
    For the masses of people in capitalist countries, the policy of preparing for a new war means continuing to increase the already unbearable tax burden, increasing the poverty of the working people, and frantically increasing the excessive profits of monopoly capital, which makes a fortune from the arms race.
    The growing economic crisis has brought even greater poverty, unemployment, hunger, and anxiety about the future to the working people of capitalist countries.
    At the same time, the policy of preparing for war is inseparable from the following aspects: the constant infringement of the basic rights and democratic freedoms of the masses of people by the imperialist ruling groups; the increasing reaction in all fields of social, political, and ideological life; and the adoption of fascist repressive measures against the progressive and democratic forces of the people. The imperialist bourgeoisie wants to use this method to prepare the rear for a predatory war.
    In this way, the Anglo-American group, like the fascist aggressors, prepares for a new war from all aspects, such as military-strategic measures, political pressure and intimidation, economic expansion and enslavement of various countries and peoples, and the indoctrination of the masses of people and the intensification of reaction.
    The leaders of American imperialism formulate their plans to launch a new world war and achieve world domination without considering the real balance of power between the imperialist camp and the socialist camp. Their plans to dominate the world are even more unfounded and adventurous than those of the Hitlerites and Japanese imperialists.
    American imperialism obviously overestimated its strength and underestimated the growing strength and organization of the anti-imperialist camp.
    The current historical situation is very different from the situation in which World War II was prepared. In the current international situation, it is infinitely more difficult for the warmongers to realize their bloody plots.
    "The people of all countries still have fresh memories of the horrors of the last war, and the social forces advocating peace are so strong for the Churchill disciples who are carrying out aggression that they cannot defeat this force and cannot turn this force to a new war." (Stalin)
    The people do not want war and hate it. They are increasingly aware of the terrible abyss into which the imperialists want to throw them.
    The unremitting struggle of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the international working class and the democratic movement for peace, freedom, and national independence and against war instigators is receiving increasingly strong support from the broadest strata of the people in all countries of the world. Therefore, there is the development of a strong movement of peace supporters. This movement unites more than 600 million people, and it is growing and expanding, including all countries in the world, attracting new fighters against the threat of war to join its ranks.
    The movement of peace supporters clearly proves that the masses of people are taking the work of defending peace into their own hands, thus proving their unyielding will to maintain the cause of peace and prevent war.
    However, it would be wrong and harmful to the cause of peace to underestimate the danger of the new war now being prepared by the imperialist countries headed by the United States and Britain.
    The great growth in the strength of the democratic and socialist camp should not lead to any complacency among the ranks of true supporters of peace.
    It would be a serious and unforgivable illusion to think that the danger of war has been reduced.
    Historical experience teaches people that the more desperate the imperialist reactionaries are, the more rampant they become, and the greater the danger of military adventures.
    Only the greatest vigilance of the people and their determination to actively fight for peace by all means can ensure that the evil plots of the war instigators will fail.
    In the face of the growing danger of a new war, the Communist and Workers' Parties have a great historical responsibility. The struggle for a solid and lasting peace, the struggle for the organization and consolidation of the forces of peace against the forces of war, should now become the focus of all activities of the Communist Parties and democratic organizations.
    In order to realize this great and noble task of saving mankind from the danger of a new war, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties believe that their most important tasks are as follows:
    1. To work more tirelessly, to organizationally consolidate this movement, and to make it universal by involving people's movements in it.
    Special attention should be paid to attracting trade unions, women, youth, cooperatives, sports, cultural, educational, religious, and other organizations, as well as scientists, writers, journalists, cultural workers, and those who are engaged in activities to defend peace and oppose war, parliamentarians, and other political and public leaders to this movement.
    Today, the task of uniting all true supporters of peace, regardless of religious belief, political opinion, or party affiliation, in the struggle for peace against the danger of a new war threatening mankind, on the broadest platform, has arisen with particular urgency.
    2. The increasingly active participation of the working class in this movement, the consolidation and unity of the working class ranks, is of decisive significance for the further development of the movement of peace supporters.
     Therefore, the primary task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to attract the broadest sections of the working class into the ranks of peace defenders; to ensure the unity of the working class on the basis of the common struggle for peace and the national independence of their countries. Organize joint action by all sections of the proletariat.
    3. Only by carrying out a resolute struggle against the splitters and saboteurs of the right-wing Social Democrats in the working-class movement can the unity of the working class be won.
    Right-wing Social Democrats such as Bevin, Attlee, Blum, Mollet, Spaak, Schumacher, Renner, and Saragat, and reactionary trade union leaders such as Green, Carey, and Deakin, are pursuing a divisive and anti-people policy. They are the main enemies of working-class unity; they are accomplices of warmongers and lackeys of imperialism, and these people conceal their treasonous acts by peddling false socialist and cosmopolitan rhetoric.
    While tirelessly fighting for peace, the Communist and Workers' Parties must daily expose the right-wing Social Democratic bosses as the deadly enemies of peace.
    It is necessary to develop and consolidate cooperation and unified action with the grassroots organizations and members of the Socialist Parties in every way; to support all truly upright elements in these parties and to explain to them the disastrous nature of the policies pursued by the reactionary right-wing leaders.
    4. The Communist and Workers' Parties should contrast the aggressive, misanthropic propaganda that aims to turn Europe and Asia into bloody battlefields with the broadest propaganda for a solid and lasting peace among all nations.
    They should constantly expose aggressive blocs and military-political alliances (especially the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Group); they should also explain that a new war will bring indescribable disasters and enormous destruction to the people, and that the struggle against war and for the defense of peace is the cause of all peoples in the world.
    It must be ensured that the war propaganda and racial hatred and hostility among all ethnic groups carried out by the agents of Anglo-American imperialism are sharply condemned by the democratic public opinion of all strata of society in every country. At the same time, it must also be ensured that no statement by any new war propagandist goes unanswered by true supporters of peace.
    5. It is necessary to apply the new and effective forms of mass struggle for peace most widely, i.e., forms that have fully proven their advantages, such as peace committees in towns and villages, the signing of petitions and protests, opinion polls widely used in France and Italy, etc. Publishing and circulating writings exposing war preparations; fundraising for peace struggle funds, boycotting all films, newspapers, books, magazines, radio stations, institutions, and leaders who promote new wars—all of these are extremely important tasks for the Communist and Workers' Parties.
    6. The Communist and working-class parties in capitalist countries should consider it their responsibility to merge the struggle for national independence with the struggle for peace, tirelessly exposing the anti-national and traitorous essence of the policies of the bourgeois governments, which have become direct subordinates of aggressive American imperialism, in order to end the shameful constraints - which manifests itself in obsequiously depending on American monopoly capitalists - and to unite and consolidate all democratic and patriotic forces in the country, with the slogans of restoring independent diplomatic and domestic policies that conform to the national interests of the people.
    It is necessary to unite the broadest masses of the people in capitalist countries to defend democratic rights and freedoms, tirelessly explaining to them that defending peace is inextricably linked to defending the vital interests of the working class and the working people, and is also inextricably linked to defending their economic and political rights.
    The Communist Parties of France, Italy, Britain, West Germany, and other countries face important tasks, as American imperialists want to use the people of these countries as cannon fodder to realize their aggressive plans.
    It is the responsibility of the Communist Parties of these countries to launch the struggle for peace with increasing energy and to thwart the evil conspiracies of the Anglo-American warmongers.
    7. While exposing the imperialist warmongers and their accomplices, the Communist and Workers' Parties of the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union face a task of further consolidating the peace and socialist camp in the cause of defending peace and the security of all peoples.
    8. Anglo-American imperialists, in realizing their aggressive plans, especially in Central and Southeastern Europe, entrust a considerably important task to the Tito group of nationalists, which is now engaged in espionage for the imperialists.
    The task of defending peace and fighting against the warmongers requires further exposing this group, which has escaped to the camp of the deadly enemies of peace, democracy, and socialism, and has escaped to the camp of imperialism and fascism.
    An organized peace front headed by the Soviet Union—the fortress and flag bearer of world peace—has emerged for the first time in human history.
    The courageous calls of the Communist Parties, which declare that all peoples will never participate in a war against the world's first socialist country, i.e., a war against the Soviet Union, are increasingly deeply rooted among the masses of people in capitalist countries.
    During the anti-fascist war, the Communist Parties of all countries stood at the forefront of the people's resistance struggle against the aggressors; in the post-war years, the Communist and Workers' Parties are the fighters on the front lines for the vital interests of their people and against new wars.
    United under the leadership of the working class, all those who oppose another war—those engaged in labor, science, and cultural work—are forming a powerful peace front capable of thwarting the evil conspiracies of the imperialists.
    The results of the great struggle for peace, which is constantly expanding, greatly depend on the strength and initiative of the Communist Parties, and turning the possibility of thwarting the warmongers into reality depends first and foremost on the Communists as vanguard fighters.
    The strength of the defenders of democracy and peace far exceeds the forces of reaction.
    The current task is to raise the people's vigilance against the war instigators to a higher level, to organize and rally the broad masses of the people, and to actively defend the cause of peace for the vital interests, life, and freedom of all peoples.

### 保卫和平与对战争贩子的斗争　情报局决议

　　保卫和平与对战争贩子的斗争
  　情报局决议
    保加利亚共产党、罗马尼亚工人党、匈牙利劳动人民党、波兰统一工人党、苏联共产党（布）、法国共产党、意大利共产党及捷克斯洛伐克共产党的代表们，在讨论了“保卫和平与对战争贩子的斗争”之报告以后，一致获得结论如下：
    过去两年来的事态，充分证实了共产党与工人党情报局在一九四七年九月所举行的第一次会议上就国际形势所作分析的正确性。
    在这个期间，世界政策的两条路线已更为明确而尖锐地形成了：一条以苏联为首的民主、反帝国主义阵营的路线，它们进行着争取各民族间和平与争取民主的坚决一贯的斗争；另一条以美国统治集团为首的帝国主义、反民主阵营的路线，它们的主要目的在于强制地建立英美世界霸权，奴役其他国家和人民，摧毁民主并发动一个新战争。
    此外，帝国主义者阵营的侵略性质，在继续增长着，美英的统治集团公开地执行一种侵略和准备新战争的政策。
    和平、民主和社会主义的力量，在对帝国主义和战争阵营的斗争中，已在数量上与实力上增长起来。
    苏联威力的进一步增强；人民民主国家在政治上与经济上的巩固以及他们已走上建立社会主义的道路这一事实；中国人民革命对国内反动派和美国帝国主义联合力量的历史性胜利；德意志民主共和国的成立；各国共产党的巩固；各资本主义国家中民主运动的增长及拥护和平运动的巨大规模——这一切都表明了反帝国主义、民主阵营的相当扩大与巩固。
    同时，帝国主义反民主阵营愈来愈弱。民主和社会主义力量的成功、正在成熟中的经济危机、资本主义总危机的进一步尖锐化、及资本主义制度外部和内部矛盾的尖锐化，都是帝国主义愈来愈弱的明证。
    有利于和平民主阵营的国际力量对比的变化，激起了帝国主义战争贩子的暴怒。
    英美帝国主义者希望用战争来改变历史发展的进程，来解决他们外部和内部的矛盾和困难，来巩固资本的地位并取得世界统治。
    帝国主义者知道时间对于他们是不利的，就热狂地急忙策划反动力量的各种集团和同盟，以实现他们的侵略计划。
    英美帝国主义集团的整个计划都是为了准备新的战争。这表现在：阻挠对德国和日本的关系的和平解决；完成德国的肢解；把德国西部占领区和美军占领下的日本，变为法西斯主义与复仇的中心及实现该集团侵略计划的跳板。
    服务于这一政策的，是苛刻的马歇尔计划以及它的直接继生物——以反对一切爱好和平的人民为目的的西欧联盟和北大西洋军事联盟；美国和西欧国家放肆的军备竞赛；军事预算的不断膨胀和美国军事基地网的扩展。
    这个政策也表现在英美集团之不顾美国原子专有的神话已经扫地而仍拒绝禁止原子武器，以及他们之用一切方法鼓动战争歇斯底里。
    这个政策决定了英美集团在联合国组织中的整个路线，这条路线的目的就是破坏联合国组织，并使之成为美国独占资本的武器。
    帝国主义者发动新战争的政策，也表现在布达佩斯的拉伊克——布兰科夫审判案中暴露了的阴谋，这个阴谋，是英美集团在已变成国际帝国主义反动派走狗的法西斯民族主义铁托集团的帮助下所组织的，以便反对人民民主国家和苏联。
    对于资本主义国家的人民群众来说，准备新战争的政策，就是继续增加已经不堪忍受的赋税负担，增加劳动人民的贫困，并疯狂地增加借军备竞赛大发其财的独占资本的超额利润。
    正在成长着的经济危机，给资本主义国家的劳动人民带来了更甚的贫困、失业、饥饿和对于明天的忧虑。
    同时，准备战争的政策又是和下述各方面不可分的：帝国主义统治集团不断侵犯人民群众的基本权利和民主自由；社会、政治和思想生活的一切领域内的愈益反动；以及对人民的进步民主力量采取法西斯镇压措施。帝国主义资产阶级想用这种办法，为掠夺战争准备后方。
    这样，英美集团象法西斯侵略者一样，从军事——战略措施、政治压力和吓诈、经济扩张和奴役各国人民以及愚化群众思想和加紧反动等各方面，来准备新战争。
    美国帝国主义的首脑们制定他们发动新世界战争和取得世界统治的计划，而不考虑到帝国主义阵营和社会主义阵营间真实的力量对比。他们统治世界的计划，甚至比希特勒分子及日本帝国主义者的计划还更没有基础，更加冒险。
    美国帝国主义者显然过高估计了他们的力量而过低估计了反帝阵营日益壮大的力量和组织。
    目前历史性的情况与第二次世界大战得以准备的局势截然不同。在目前国际情况下，战争贩子们要实现他们血腥的图谋，是无比地困难得多了。
    “上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新，主张和平的社会力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说是如此地强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去。”（斯大林语）
    人民不愿战争，而且痛恨它。他们日益认识到帝国主义者想把他们抛入何等可怖的深渊。
    苏联、人民民主国家和国际工人阶级以及民主运动中争取和平、自由与各民族独立、反对战争挑拨者的不懈的斗争，正得到全世界一切国家最广大人民阶层日益增长的强大支持。因此就有了和平拥护者强大运动的发展。这一运动团结了六亿余人民，它正在成长和扩展着，包括了世界上所有的国家，吸引着反对战争威胁的新的斗士参加它的行列。
    和平拥护者的运动清楚地证明了：人民群众正把保卫和平的工作掌握在自己手里，这样就证明他们维护和平事业与阻止战争的不屈不挠的意志。
    然而，要是低估以美、英为首的帝国主义国家现在正在准备的新战争所具有的危险，那就错误了，而且对和平事业是有害的。
    民主与社会主义阵营力量的巨大增长，不应使和平的真正拥护者的队伍里产生任何满足的情绪。
    要是认为战争危险已经减少，那就是一个严重的不可原恕的幻想。
    历史经验教训人们：帝国主义反动派愈是绝望，则它愈猖狂，而且军事冒险的危险则愈大。
    只有人民的最大警惕和他们以一切方法为和平而积极斗争的决心，才能确保战争挑拨者的罪恶阴谋归于失败。
    在新战争的危险逐渐增长的情况下，共产党和工人党员有伟大的历史责任。　 为巩固的与持久的和平而斗争，为和平力量的组织起来和巩固起来反对战争势力而斗争，现在应当成为共产党和民主组织全部活动的中心。
    为了实现拯救人类免于新战争危险的这一伟大而崇高的任务，共产党和工人党的代表们认为他们的至关紧要的任务如下：
    一、更加不屈不挠地工作，在组织上巩固这一运动，并使人民运动参加到这一运动中，使之普遍化。
    应该特别注意的是：要把工会、妇女、青年、合作社、体育、文化、教育、宗教及其他组织，以及科学家、作家、新闻工作者、文化工作者，和那些进行保卫和平反对战争的活动的、议会及其他政治与公众的领袖吸引到这一运动中。
    今天，不分宗教信仰、政治见解和党派，把一切真正的和平拥护者，在争取和平反对威胁人类的新战争危险的斗争中，在最广泛的纲领上团结起来——这一任务已带着特别的迫切性而产生了。
    二、对和平拥护者运动的进一步发展具有决定性意义的，就是工人阶级越来越积极地参加这一运动，就是工人阶级队伍的巩固和团结。
     因此，共产党和工人党的头等重要的任务就是要把工人阶级的最广大部分，吸引到和平保卫者的队伍中来；确保工人阶级的团结，在为和平与他们国家的民族独立而共同斗争的基础上。组织无产阶级的各个部分的联合行动。
    三、只有进行坚决的斗争，反对工人阶级运动的右翼社会党人的分裂者和破坏者，才能赢得工人阶级的团结。
    贝文、艾德礼、勃鲁姆、摩勒、斯巴克、舒马赫、伦纳、萨拉盖特一类的右翼社会党人，和格林、加莱与狄金一类的反动工会领袖，执行着分裂和反人民的政策，他们是工人阶级团结的主要敌人；他们是战争贩子的同谋和帝国主义的从仆，而这些人以贩卖假社会主义和世界主义的词藻来掩盖他们的叛逆行为。
    共产党和工人党在不倦地为和平而斗争的时候，必须天天揭露三翼社会党的头子是和平的死敌。
    必须用种种方法来发展并巩固与社会党基层组织和党员群众的合作及统一行动；支持这些党内的一切真正正直的分子，并向他们解释反动的右翼领袖所遵循的政策之灾难性质。
    四、共产党和工人党应该把侵略者力求使欧洲和亚洲变为血腥战场的仇恨人类的宣传，与争取各民族间的巩固的及持久的和平之最广泛宣传作一个对照。
    他们应当不断地揭露侵略集团和军事——政治联盟（特别是西欧联盟和北大西洋集团）；他们还应该说明，一个新的战争将会给人民带来难以描述的灾难和巨大的破坏，而反对战争、保卫和平的斗争，则是世界上所有各族人民的事业。
    必须保证英美帝国主义代理人所作的战争宣传和种族仇恨及各族人民间的敌视受到每一国家一切阶层的民主舆论的尖锐谴责。同时也必须保证，不要让新战争宣传者任何一个言论不受到真正的和平支持者的答复。
    五、必须最广泛地应用争取和平的群众性斗争之新的而有效的形式，即已经完全证实其优点的形式，如市镇和乡间的和平委员会，请愿书和抗议书的签名，在法国和意大利所广泛利用的民意测验等等。发行并流传揭露战争准备的著述；争取和平斗争基金的捐募，抵制一切宣传新战争的电影、报纸、书籍、杂志、广播公司、机关和领袖人物——所有这些都是共产党和工人党极端紧要的任务。
    六、资本主义国家内的共产党和工人阶级政党，应认为他们有责任把争取民族独立的斗争合并于争取和平的斗争，不倦地揭露已成为侵略性的美帝国主义直接下属的资产阶级政府的政策，所具有的反民族和叛卖的本质，以终止可耻的束缚——这表现为卑躬屈膝地依附于美国垄断资本家——和回复符合于人民民族利益的独立的外交内政政策这两上口号为中心，团结和巩固该国的一切民主爱国力量。
    必须团结资本主义国家内最广泛的人民群众，以保卫民主权利和自由，不懈地向他们解释，保卫和平与保卫工人阶级和劳动人民的切身利益有不可分的连系，并且与保卫他们的经济和政治权利也有不可分的连系。
    法国、意大利、英国、西德和其他国家的共产党，面临着重要的任务，因为美帝国主义者要利用这些国家的人民作炮灰，以实现他们的侵略计划。
    这些国家的共产党的职责，是以日益增大的精力展开争取和平的斗争，挫败英美战争贩子的罪恶阴谋。
    七、与揭露帝国主义战争贩子和他们的同谋者同时，人民民主国家和苏联的共产党和工人党，在保卫和平和各族人民的安全的事业中，面临更进一步巩固和平和社会主义阵营的任务。
    八、英美帝国主义者在实现他们的侵略计划、特别是在中欧和东南欧的计划时，将相当重大的任务委托给民族主义者的铁托集团，这个集团现在正在为帝国主义者作间谍工作。
    保卫和平并与战争贩子进行斗争的任务，要求更进一步揭露这个已经逃到和平、民主和社会主义的死敌的阵营、逃到了帝国主义和法西斯主义阵营的集团。
    一个以苏联——全世界和平的堡垒和旗手——为首的有组织的和平阵线，在人类历史上空前第一次地出现了。
    日益广泛地深入资本主义人民群众中的，是共产党的勇敢号召，这些号召宣称：各族人民将永远不会参加反对世界上第一个社会主义国家的战争，亦即对苏联的战争。
    在反法西斯主义的战争当中，各国的共产党都站在反侵略者的人民抵抗斗争的前列；在战后的岁月里，共产党和工人党是争取它们的人民的切身利益和反对新战争的第一线上的战士。
    团结在工人阶级的领导之下，一切反对另一次战争的人——从事于劳动、科学和文化工作的人——正在组成一个强有力的、能够挫败帝国主义者罪恶阴谋的和平阵线。
    不断地日益扩大的伟大和平斗争的成果，大大取决于共产党的力量和主动，将挫败战争贩子的可能性变为现实一事，便首先取决于作为先锋战士的共产党人。
    民主及和平维护者的力量大大超过了反动的力量。
    目前的工作是把人民对战争挑拨者的警惕提高到更高的水平，组织并集结广大的人民群众，为各族人民的切身利益，为生命和自由而积极地保卫和平事业。
