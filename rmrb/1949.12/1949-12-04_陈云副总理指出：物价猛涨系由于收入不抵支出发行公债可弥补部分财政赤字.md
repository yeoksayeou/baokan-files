　　Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out: Soaring Prices Due to Income Not Keeping Pace with Expenditures; Issuing Public Bonds Can Cover Part of the Fiscal Deficit
    Regarding the currency depreciation and soaring prices that began in mid-October, Vice Premier Chen pointed out that the main reasons were: With the victory of the People's Liberation Army and the liberation of vast areas, the government's financial expenditures greatly increased, while financial revenue far lagged behind the needs of expenditures, resulting in excessive issuance of banknotes. Vice Premier Chen said that the financial situation for the next year will be better than this year because the war is coming to an end, revenue is gradually increasing, and expenditures are being strictly economized, but the deficit will still be very large. The people of the whole country are elated by the victory of the People's Liberation Army and understand the difficulties of the People's Government in the War of Liberation, but they also hope that the government will find ways to stabilize finance and prices even in the face of difficulties. Therefore, the government cannot rely solely on increasing the issuance of currency in its fiscal measures. Vice Premier Chen said that the role of issuing public bonds is to make up for part of the fiscal deficit. If the result of issuing public bonds to reduce the deficit improves next year's currency value and prices compared to this year, it will not only benefit the working people and military, government, and teaching staff who rely on wages, but also benefit the legitimate operations of industry and commerce.

　　陈云副总理指出：物价猛涨系由于收入不抵支出
    发行公债可弥补部分财政赤字
    关于从十月中旬开始的币价下跌和物价猛涨，陈副总理指出，其主要原因是：随着人民解放军的胜利和广大地区的获得解放，政府的财政支出大大增加，而财政的收入远还赶不上支出的需要，因而钞票发行过多。陈副总理说，明年度财政情况，由于战争趋于结束，收入逐步增加，支出厉行节约，一定要比今年好些，但是赤字仍将很大。全国人民对于解放军的胜利欢欣鼓舞，也理解到人民政府在解放战争中的困难，但是又希望政府即使在困难中也要设法使金融物价比较稳定。因此，政府在财政措施上不能单纯依靠增发通货。陈副总理说，发行公债的作用在于弥补一部分财政字。如果发行公债缩小赤字的结果，使明年的币值与物价比今年改善，则不但对于靠工资生活的劳动人民和军政公教人员有好处，而且对于工商业的正当经营也有好处。
