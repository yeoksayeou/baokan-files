　　Beijing's First Rat Eradication Campaign Concluded
    [From Our Newspaper] The first phase of the rat eradication campaign launched by the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee to prevent plague concluded on the 24th of last month. In fourteen days, a total of 42,231 rats were caught in the city. During this campaign, citizens not only actively assisted, but also demonstrated creativity, inventing new rat-catching devices. For example, citizen Zhang Shanrui invented the "wooden cat," which caught more than 20 rats in three days. The second phase of the rat eradication campaign has now begun throughout the city.

　　京市捕鼠第一期已结束
    【本报讯】京市防疫委员会为预防鼠疫所发动的捕鼠运动，第一期已于上月二十四日结束，在十四天内，全市共捕鼠四万二千二百三十一只。在这次运动中，市民除积极协助外，更发挥了创造力，发明了新的捕鼠器具，如市民张善瑞发明的“木猫”，三天便捕鼠二十多只。全市现已开始第二期捕鼠运动。
