Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 16th:

　　To the Women Sisters of Asian Countries
    Dear Sisters!
    We are living in a great era of history. The shackles of slavery that have lasted for thousands of years are being shattered.

    Hundreds of millions of people in Asia have overthrown the oppression of imperialism and feudal reactionaries, and hundreds of millions of people are fighting for national independence and people's democracy.

    The decisive victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have greatly strengthened and consolidated the cause of world peace and democracy. Due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, a new and glorious page has been unfolded in the history of Asian nations.

    Dear sisters! We believe that the day of final victory for our nations is near, but in order to win this victory, we must continue and strengthen our struggle, because imperialism still possesses considerable power in Asia.

    The imperialist robbers and the local feudal forces are absolutely unwilling to give up their privileges and their rule. They are trying every means to stifle the Asian nations' desire for independence and democracy.

    American imperialists are trying to dominate the world and are openly preparing for a new war against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.

    In order to achieve this goal, American imperialists are attempting to establish a Pacific Pact and a Near East Pact in addition to the Atlantic Military Alliance, and are supporting and arming the Chinese reactionaries. It occupies southern Korea and attempts to turn it into its own colony. It is reviving Japanese imperialism, dreaming of turning it into a new base for world war.

    American imperialism supports Britain, France, and the Netherlands in wars against oppressed nations.

    Tens of thousands of British regular troops are used to suppress the people of Malaya by bloody means.

    Dutch invaders massacre freedom-loving people in Indonesia.

    French imperialists are waging a brutal war against the Republic of Vietnam.

    Competing Anglo-American monopoly groups are inciting fratricidal civil wars in Near Eastern countries.

    In Iran, dominated by American war profiteers and American capital, a brutal reactionary rule is being implemented.

    The development of the national independence struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries has led imperialists not only to adopt barbaric force, but also to adopt more hypocritical methods of rule.

    Imperialists have established puppet governments in India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia, and Transjordan.

    In order to establish these governments, they must collude with local feudal forces and reactionary big capitalists, because they similarly want to maintain their own privileges over their own people. Imperialists also try their best to divide the national liberation movement and create national and religious disputes.

    In order to further aggression against oppressed Asian countries, American imperialists are deceiving the people of colonial and dependent countries with the Truman Plan in the name of aiding economically backward countries.

    In reality, under the pretext of economic assistance, these governments are forced to serve the interests of imperialism. At the same time, they force these reactionary governments to brutally suppress the liberation movements and the workers' movements of their own people. They attempt to force these countries to become military bases in preparation for the Third World War.

    The governments of these so-called autonomous countries are merely tools to deceive the oppressed nations and maintain imperialist oppression.

    With the help of reactionary big capitalists in their own countries, imperialists especially want to turn India into a fortress against the national independence movement of the Asian people, and as an imperialist military base.

    In fact, British, American, French, and Dutch imperialists and their accomplices are still doing all kinds of evil in our countries, just as they did in the past. Colonial rulers extract large amounts of wealth from our countries. They transport away minerals, valuable agricultural products, and strategic raw materials. These foreign robbers bring famine, poverty, barbaric exploitation, darkness and ignorance to our people.

    While we ourselves are scantily clothed, and our children are dying of starvation—thousands of ships are carrying cotton and rice away from our country.

    Complete slave labor is still widespread on plantations in India, Malaya, Indonesia, and Iran.

    Constant hunger, appalling working conditions, periodic epidemics, high mortality rates, widespread illiteracy, and miserable lives are the result of Western colonial rule!

    In those places ruled by foreign imperialism and its lackeys, the broad masses of women have neither political, social, nor economic rights.

    Women who do the same work as men receive even less pitiful wages than men, so little that they can hardly maintain even a half-full life.

    Our children work in mines, factories, and plantations from the age of five or six. They do not know what childhood is, and die from overwork.

    It is precisely because of the evils of British, American, French, and Dutch imperialists and their accomplices that there are no maternal and child health care institutions in our countries. Diseases are rampant, and the infant mortality rate has reached an alarming level.

    It is precisely because of these evils that such terrible disasters as child prostitution and child trafficking still exist.

    It is precisely because of these evils that millions of children in colonial and dependent countries are deprived of the opportunity to go to school.

    Asian women are unwilling to be slaves any longer! They have risen up to fight for national independence and people's democracy, for human rights, equality, food, and the happiness of their children!

    In places where imperialists launch armed attacks, women enthusiastically support and participate in the people's armed resistance. Because they know that this is the only way for them to win national liberation and women's liberation!

    However, a group of national traitors, accepting imperialist orders and calling themselves "governments," use terror to suppress national liberation forces, oppose all progressive groups, and persecute democratic women's movements. Our sisters, the best and most outstanding daughters of the people, are thrown into prisons and die from torture and bullets. Such reactionary terror is intensifying day by day in all areas under the rule of imperialists and their lackeys.

    We Asian women openly declare: We are carrying out and will continue to carry out a resolute struggle against foreign imperialists and their lackeys. We want national independence, we want democratic freedom, we want equality, we want to see our children well-fed and happy.

    The great example of the women of the Soviet Asian Republics encourages us. For many years, they have been equal and free citizens, and together with men, they are building a happy and joyful life for their people and their children.

    The women of the People's Republic of China, Mongolia, North Korea, and the liberated areas of Vietnam have already obtained political and economic equal rights; they play a significant role in the social life of these countries, and they look forward to the future with infinite confidence.

    This convinces us Asian women that only in those places where imperialism, feudal forces, and the reactionary rule of comprador bourgeoisie have been overthrown, and the people are masters of their own destiny, can women have true liberation. Only the people's power can guarantee women's equality and the opportunity for free labor, and give our children happiness and joy.

    Women, mothers, and sisters of Asian colonies and dependent countries!

    The Asian Women's Representative Conference held in Beijing calls on you to contribute all your strength to the national liberation struggle of your people!

    Use all your strength to support and assist the sacred national liberation war of the people of your motherland, drive the invaders out of the country! Strive for the independence of your own country, abolish all the privileges of imperialists in your country.

    Expose the treacherous acts of puppet governments that betray the cause of national independence for the interests of colonial rulers!

    Fight for all the daily economic, political, and social interests of women.

    Demand labor legislation, demand protection for mothers and children!

    Demand the establishment of schools, clinics, kindergartens, and nurseries for our children!

    Asian women, women workers, peasant women, professional women, and intellectual women! Remember, unity is strength, the guarantee of defeating imperialism and reactionary forces.

    Unite regardless of nationality, class, political, or religious beliefs, and unite with your people—all those who oppose imperialism and its lackeys—to form a broad national united front and fight together for national independence and people's democracy!

    Sisters who are in areas under the strong rule of imperialism and reactionaries! You must organize yourselves in various forms according to the specific conditions at the time and place. The activists among you must participate in all mass organizations, so as to organize and educate the masses of women to fight for the protection of their vital interests.

    Japanese women! Oppose new war preparations, oppose the revival of fascist forces, and fight for the establishment of a peaceful, independent, and democratic Japan!

    Women of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq, and Egypt, you must fight for your national independence, for democracy, to prevent your country from becoming a military base for war instigators to attack the Soviet Union, the main force for defending peace!

    Women of Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaya! Continue your selfless struggle against imperialism! Your heroic struggle is a significant contribution to the cause of the entire democratic camp in its struggle for peace!

    Chinese sisters! Happily and strongly build a new China! Consolidate the people's democratic country!

    Korean women, persist in working for the happiness of a unified Korean People's Democratic Republic; strive to liberate your entire country from the oppression of American imperialism!

    Soviet women! Further consolidate the strength of your motherland, the fortress of peace and democracy! Remember, the stronger your country is, the more consolidated the forces of peace!

    We Asian women know that we are not isolated in our struggle; there are hundreds of millions of democratic women and men who are fighting to eliminate imperialism with us! The International Democratic Women's Federation, which is constantly fighting for the interests of oppressed women in Asia, is with us!

    We must consolidate our unity in the International Democratic Women's Federation and the international peace camp!

    Long live the victory of the national liberation struggle of the Asian people!

    Long live the unity of women of all countries who are fighting for world peace, for the equality of all nations, and for their own rights!

　　To the Women of America, Britain, France, and Holland
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 16th: The Asian Women's Representative Conference today passed "To the Women of America, Britain, France, and Holland," the full text of which is as follows: We, the women and mothers of Asian countries, representing our hundreds of millions of sisters, appeal to the women and mothers of the imperialist countries that are oppressing our people—America, Britain, France, and Holland:

    Today, we are gathered in Beijing, the capital of the newly established People's Republic of China, to call on our sisters to unite and strengthen the struggle to fulfill our sacred mission, which is: to liberate our children from the shackles of slavery and strive for a free and happy future for them.

    For many centuries, your regimes have maintained their rule over Asia and brought us war and disaster. They have shamelessly plundered everything from us, and they have suppressed all progressive evolution in our countries. They have placed the terrible burden of the colonial system and the feudal system on us.

    They are looking for military bases in Asia, and they want to make Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, Iran, and other countries their military bases for aggression.

    The colonial rulers are greedy for profit and hegemony. Whether they are blatant reactionaries or the Labor Party, their imperialist faces are the same. The countless crimes committed by the governments of America, Britain, France, and the Netherlands and those they employ in our Asian countries are extremely shameless!

    The colonialists plunder vast amounts of wealth from our Asian countries. They take away our natural resources, the valuable products of our land, strategic materials, and everything we have earned through our labor. But in return, they bring us endless famine, indescribable disasters, terrible diseases, ignorance, and barbaric exploitation.

    Our children are naked and have no clothes to wear, and they are dying of hunger, but thousands of ships loaded with vast amounts of rice and cotton are leaving our harbors.

    On the plantations in India, Malaya, and Indonesia, our people are working like slaves, and they are extremely worried about the lives of our children.

    There is no guarantee for mothers, women workers, women, and their children. We work fifteen hours a day on an empty stomach, but the wages we receive are barely enough to buy a handful of rice.

    Our unfortunate children have to work in mines, factories, or plantations from the age of five or six. They do not know what the happiness of childhood is. Their bodies gradually become thin like skeletons, and they eventually collapse and die from overwork. They die at the age when your children are starting elementary school.

    Let us think about the despair of those mothers who have no choice but to sell their own children to factory owners and landlords!

    Let us look at the result of so-called "Western civilization"!

    When we fight for the lives of our children, for national independence, national culture, and democracy, for our right to survive, they imprison us, and the best daughters of our people die under torture and gunfire.

    We women of all Asia solemnly declare: Now and in the future, we will fight until imperialism is defeated in our countries.

    We are closely united with all our people and fight together against all oppression and for national independence. In countries where armed resistance has become necessary, we participate in the struggle of our people to resist those imperialists who are trying to maintain their privileges. We want peace, freedom, and national liberation; we want to see our children healthy and happy.

    You American, British, French, and Dutch mothers, you love your children as we do, and you are equally proud of them. Do you know the pain a mother feels when she sees others killing her children? You should also understand why we rise up against the imperialist executioners!

    How can you stop the crimes of your governments in Asia? We know how to expand the resistance of the people against imperialism in creating poverty and launching wars throughout the world, and we also know how millions of men and women are fighting for national independence, and we deeply know that the power of democracy and socialism is bound to win.

    All people with a sense of justice will unite with this great struggle, because this struggle ignites the flames of all progressive humanity. The peoples advancing towards peace and happiness are irresistible by any force. The imperialists tremble before them, and the masks of the mad plans of the Wall Street bosses are being torn off. They have always dreamed of turning the world into their colony through war and rule.

    French, British, and Dutch mothers! The imperialists send your children to the front lines in order to force us to obey their rule with cruel wars; they force your children to die in vain for the imperialist purposes of plunder.

    American mothers! The tanks and planes manufactured by your factories burn down our villages, destroy our meager means of livelihood, slaughter our children, and intensify the terror of our lives.

    The money that your government uses for the wars in Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and China and for the brutal oppression in Iran, India, South Korea, and other countries is stolen from your pockets.

    Dear sisters! Do not forget that a nation that oppresses other nations can never be a free nation itself!

    You also bear the heavy burden of imperialist war. In your countries, military budgets are constantly expanding, your living standards are constantly declining, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. In order to suppress your resistance to reactionary rule and new war preparations, your governments are increasingly restricting and depriving you of your rights; therefore, in your countries, democracy has become empty words.

    Women, mothers! Be careful! Unless you resolutely come out against the imperialist war policies of your governments, your living standards will decline even further, and the war crisis will increase.

    The imperialists want to dig a gap of hatred and deception between us, do not believe them!

    Like you, we love our own children and yearn to see them happy! Therefore, no force can remove our love for freedom and national independence from our hearts.

    We love our motherland and hope to see them free and prosperous. We are proud of our country's thousands of years of history and contribution to human civilization.

    In today's Asia, millions of our sisters have been liberated. We have personally seen that our most precious wishes have been realized in the Soviet Union. In the Asian republics, these former colonies of the Tsars have now become prosperous countries. There, women who actively participate in the construction of a new society are equal partners of their husbands and happy mothers of their children.

    People's Republics are being established one after another in Asia. Mongolia, great China, Korea, and the liberated areas of Vietnam are already building new societies, which are opening up the road to happiness for women.

    In Asia, every country that wins freedom is a new bastion of peace. The victory of the Chinese revolution liberated the Chinese people from the rule of war-mongers and turned China into a bastion of peace and democracy.

    We deeply know the great significance of our struggle for the sovereignty and integrity of our motherland. We believe that the great unity of women around the world will be of great help to this struggle. The International Democratic Women's Federation is a living embodiment of our friendship and unity.

    Women of America, Britain, France, and Holland! Our struggle is arduous. We appeal to you. Strengthen your solidarity with us!

    Do not be accomplices of the executioners! You must speak out loudly and expose their crimes.

    Do not let our children kill each other! Demand an end to colonial wars! Demand that your governments withdraw their troops from Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and Korea! Use all your strength to demand that your governments stop interfering in the affairs of Asian countries! Support all proposals in the United Nations that are conducive to the cause of national independence in Asia! Demand the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons!

    Strengthen the struggle for true democracy in your countries! Every victory you win in the struggle against imperialism is our victory!

    For the consolidation and lasting peace of the world, for the friendship of the peoples of all nations, for a bright future illuminated by peace and justice, where there will be no more slavery, fight with us!

    Long live the unity of women around the world!

　　亚洲妇女代表会议的宣言和决议
  　致亚洲各国妇女姊妹书
    【新华社北京十六日电】亚洲妇女代表会议今日通过“致亚洲各国妇女姊妹书”，全文如下：
    亲爱的姊妹们！
    我们生活在历史的伟大时代。千百年的奴隶镣铐正在被粉碎中。
    亚洲几万万人民已经推翻了帝国主义与封建反动的压迫，几万万人民正在为着民族独立与人民民主而斗争。
    中国人民底决定性的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，大大地加强和巩固了全世界和平与民主的事业。由于中国革命的胜利，在亚洲各民族的历史中展开了新的光辉的一页。
    亲爱的姊妹们！我们相信，我们各民族的最后胜利的日子是近了，但是为了赢得这个胜利，我们还必须继续和加强我们的斗争，因为帝国主义在亚洲还拥有相当大的力量。
    帝国主义强盗们和当地的封建势力是决不愿意放弃他们的特权与他们的统治，他们正在用尽一切办法企图窒息亚洲民族争取独立与民主的愿望。
    美帝国主义者力图称霸世界，公开准备对苏联及新民主主义国家的新的战争。
    为了达到这个目的，美帝国主义者企图在大西洋军事协定之外，建立一个太平洋协定和近东协定，并支持和武装中国的反动派。它占领了朝鲜南部，并企图使它变为自己底殖民地。它正在恢复日本帝国主义，梦想把它变成一个新的世界战争的基地。
    美帝国主义支持英、法、荷，对于被压迫民族的战争。
    英国的好几万正规军用来以血腥的手段镇压马来亚的人民。
    荷兰侵略者屠杀爱好自由的印度尼西亚的人民。
    法国帝国主义者对越南共和国进行着残酷的战争。
    彼此竞争着的英美垄断集团在近东各国挑动着兄弟阋墙的内战。
    在美国战争贩子和美国资本所主宰的伊朗，正实行着残暴的反动统治。
    殖民地附属国人民的民族独立斗争的发展，使得帝国主义者不仅采取野蛮的武力，并且采取更虚伪的统治办法。
    帝国主义者在印度、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、锡兰、缅甸、印度尼西亚、外约但建立傀儡政府。
    为了建立这些政府，他们必须勾结当地的封建势力以及反动的大资本家，因为他们同样的要维持自己对于本国人民的特权，帝国主义者还尽量用各种方法去分化民族的解放运动、造成民族和宗教的纷争。
    美帝国主义者为了更进一步的侵略亚洲被压迫的国家以援助经济落后国家为名的杜鲁门计划来欺骗殖民地和附属国的人民。
    实际上借口经济援助，强迫这些政府为帝国主义利益而服务，同时他们迫使这些反动政府对本国人民的解放运动，以及工人运动加以残酷的镇压，他们企图迫使这些国家成为准备第三次大战中的军事根据地。
    这种所谓自治国家的政府仅仅是为了欺骗被压迫的民族以维持帝国主义压迫的工具。
    帝国主义者在本国的反动的大资本家帮助之下，特别想将印度变成反亚洲人民民族独立运动的堡垒，作为帝国主义的军事基地。
    事实上英、美、法、荷帝国主义者及其帮凶们，在我们国家里还是和过去一样作恶多端，殖民地统治者从我们国家榨取大量的财富，他们运走矿产，值钱的农产品和战略原料，这些外国的强盗们却给我们的人民带来了灾荒、穷困、野蛮的剥削，黑暗与愚昧。
    当我们自己衣不蔽体，当我们底孩子死于饥饿的时候——成千的船只却从我们的国家运走棉花和大米。
    在印度、马来亚、印尼、伊朗的种植场上还普遍地存在着完全的奴隶劳动。
    经常的饥饿，恶劣不堪的劳动条件，周期性的流行病，高度的死亡率，普遍的文盲与悲惨的生活，这就是西方殖民者统治的结果！
    在外国帝国主义及其走狗们所统治的那些地方，广大的妇女群众既没有政治的、也没有社会的、经济的权利。
    和男人作一样劳动的妇女，比男人所得的可怜的工资还要少，少到甚至连半饱的生活都难以维持。
    我们的孩子们从五六岁起就在矿山、工厂和种植场作工。他们不知道什么是童年，就死于过度的劳动。
    正是由于美、英、法、荷帝国主义者及其走狗的罪恶，使我们国家里没有妇婴保健机关。疾病猖獗，儿童死亡率到达了惊人高度。
    正是由于这些罪恶，使得童妓和买卖孩子这样可怕的灾难还继续存在着。
    正是由于这些罪恶，殖民地和附属国人们的千百万儿童被剥夺了求学的机会。
    亚洲的妇女们不愿再作奴隶！她们已经起来，为争取民族独立与人民民主而斗争，为争取人权、平等、口粮和孩子们的幸福而斗争！
    在帝国主义者发动武装进攻的地方，那里的妇女热烈地支援和参加了人民的武装反抗。因为她们知道，这是她们争取民族解放与妇女解放的唯一道路！
    然而一群民族叛徒，接受帝国主义的命令，以“政府”自居，用恐怖的手段来镇压民族解放的力量，来反对一切进步团体并迫害民主妇女运动。我们底姊妹们，人民底最好和最优秀的女儿们，被掷在监狱里，并死于酷刑与枪弹。这样的反动恐怖，在一切帝国主义者及其走狗统治之下的地区，正在一天比一天加强。
    我们亚洲各国妇女公开声明：我们正在进行并且将继续进行反抗外国帝国主义者及其走狗的坚决斗争。我们要民族独立，要民主自由，要平等，要看到自己底孩子们饱暖而幸福。
    苏联亚洲共和国的妇女们的伟大榜样鼓励着我们。她们多年来都是平等和自由的公民，并且和男子一起，为自己底人民和自己底孩子们建设幸福和快乐的生活。
    中华人民共和国，蒙古，朝鲜北部和越南解放区的妇女们已经获得了政治的和经济的平等权利；她们在这些国家的社会生活中起着重大的作用，她们以无限的信心展望着未来。
    这使我们亚洲妇女们确信，只有在推翻帝国主义、封建势力和买办资产阶级的反动统治，而人民为自己命运的主人的那些地方，妇女才能有真正的解放。只有人民的政权才能为妇女保障平等和自由劳动的机会，并给我们底孩子们以快乐和幸福。
    亚洲殖民地和附属国的妇女们，母亲们和姊妹们！
    在北京召开的亚洲妇女代表会议号召你们把一切力量贡献给你们人民的民族解放斗争！
    用全力来拥护和支援你们祖国人民神圣的民族解放战争，把侵略者赶出国境！争取自己祖国的独立，取消帝国主义者在你们国家内的一切特权。
    揭穿为殖民统治者的利益而背叛民族独立事业的傀儡政府的卖国行为！
    为妇女一切日常经济的、政治的、社会的利益而斗争。
    要求劳动立法，要求保护母亲与儿童！
    要求为我们的孩子们设立学校，诊疗所，幼稚园和托儿所！
    亚洲的妇女们，女工们，农妇们，职业妇女和知识妇女们！记着，团结就是力量，就是战胜帝国主义和反动势力的保证。
    你们要不分民族，不分阶层，不分政治宗教信仰地团结起来，并且和你们的人民——一切反对帝国主义及其走狗的人们——团结起来，组成广大的民族统一战线，共同为民族独立与人民民主而斗争！
    处在帝国主义和反动派强固统治地区的姊妹们！你们要按照当时当地的具体情况，采用各种各样的形式组织起来。你们中间的积极分子要参加到一切有群众的团体中去，这样组织和教育妇女群众为保卫她们的切身利益而斗争。
    日本的妇女们！反对新的战争准备反对法西斯势力的复活，为建立一个和平、独立和民主的日本而斗争！
    伊朗、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、以色列、伊拉克、埃及的妇女们，你们要为你们的民族独立，为民主，为阻止你们的国家成为战争挑拨者攻击为保卫和平的主要力量的苏联的军事基地而斗争！
    越南、印尼、缅甸和马来亚的妇女们！继续你们反抗帝国主义的奋不顾身的斗争！你们的英勇的斗争，对于整个民主阵营为和平而斗争的事业，是一个重大的贡献！
    中国的姊妹们！快乐而坚强地建设新中国！把人民民主国家巩固起来！
    朝鲜妇女们，为统一的朝鲜人民民主共和国的幸福而坚持工作；为把你们的国家全部从美国帝国主义的压迫下解放出来而奋斗！
    苏联妇女们！更进一步地巩固你们祖国的力量，和平民主的堡垒！记着，你们国家越强大，和平力量越巩固！
    我们亚洲妇女们知道，在我们的斗争中，我们不是孤立的；还有为消灭帝国主义而斗争着的几万万民主妇女和男人们是和我们在一起的！为亚洲被压迫妇女的利益而不断斗争着的国际民主妇女联合会是和我们在一起的！
    我们要在国际民主妇女联合会和国际和平阵营中巩固我们的团结！
    亚洲人民的民族解放斗争胜利万岁！
    为世界和平，为各民族平等，为自身权利而斗争着的各国妇女团结万岁！
  　告美、英、法、荷妇女书
    【新华社北京十六日电】亚洲妇女代表会议今日通过“告美国、英国、法国、荷兰妇女书”全文如下：我们，亚洲各国的妇女和母亲们，代表着我们几万万的姊妹们，向正在压迫我们人民的帝国主义国家——美国、英国、法国和荷兰的妇女和母亲们呼吁：
    今天，我们在新成立的中华人民共和国的首都北京集会，是为了号召我们的姊妹们团结起来，并为完成我们的神圣任务而加强斗争，这一任务就是：把我们的孩子们从奴隶的枷锁中解放出来，并为他们争取自由和幸福的未来。
    许多世纪以来，你们的政权维持着对亚洲的统治，并给我们带来了战争与灾难。他们无耻地掠夺我们的一切，他们抑制了我们各国的一切进步的演变。他们把殖民制度和封建制度的可怕的重负压在我们的身上。
    他们在亚洲寻找军事基地，他们想使日本，菲律宾，越南，朝鲜南部，伊朗等国都成为他们侵略的军事根据地。
    殖民地的统治者们贪馋着利润和霸权。不论是露骨的反动派还是工党，它们的帝国主义的面貌都是一样的，美、英、法、荷各国政府和他们在我们亚洲各国所雇佣的人们所作的无数罪行真是无耻之极！
    殖民者们大量的掠夺我们亚洲国家的财富，他运走了我们天然的富源，我们土地宝贵的产品，战略物资和我们用劳力所换来的一切，但是反过来，他们带给我们的却是永无止境的饥荒，无法形容的灾难，可怖的疾病、愚昧、和野蛮的剥削。
    我们的孩子们都是赤着身体没有衣服穿，他们都因饥饿而死亡，但是成千艘的轮船装载着大量的米和棉花开出了我们的海港。
    在印度、马来亚、印度尼西亚的种植场里我们的人民都是象奴隶似的在工作，一面极担心着我们孩子们的生活。
    对于母亲们，女工们，妇女们和她们的孩子们是丝毫没有保障的，我们饿着肚子每天要工作十五小时，可是我们所得到的报酬几乎不能买到一把米。
    我们不幸的孩子们从五、六岁起就要在矿山、工厂或种植场工作。他们不知道什么是童年的幸福。他们的身体渐渐瘦弱的象骷髅一样，最后还是因过度的劳动而倒毙了，当他们倒毙时的年龄正是你们的孩子们开始进小学时的年龄。
    我们想一想，那些不得已把自己亲生的儿女出卖给工厂主和地主的母亲们失望的心！
    我们看一看所谓“西方文明”的结果吧！
    当我们为了我们孩子们的生命，为了民族独立，民族文化与民主，为了我们生存的权利而斗争的时候，他们就把我们监禁起来，我们人民的最优秀的女儿们都死在严刑和枪支下了。
    我们全亚洲的妇女们郑重的声明：现在和将来我们都要斗争，一直到帝国主义在我们的国家里被打倒以后。
    我们和我们的全体人民紧密的结合在一起，为反对一切压迫，为争取民族独立而共同斗争。在那些武装抵抗已成为必要的国家中，我们参加了我们人民的斗争去反抗那些企图保持他们的特权的帝国主义者。我们要和平、自由和民族解放；我们要看见我们孩子的健康与幸福。
    你们美国、英国、法国、荷兰的母亲们，你们和我们一样热爱自己的孩子，你们，同样因为有了他们而自豪，你们知道做母亲的看见旁人杀害她们的孩子们的时候心里的痛苦吗？你们也应明白为什么我们起来反抗帝国主义刽子手们！
    你们怎样才能阻止你们的政府在亚洲的罪行呢？我们知道怎样才能在全世界扩大人民大众反抗帝国主义在制造穷困与发动战争，我们也晓得数百万男女为了民族独立作了怎样的斗争，我们更深深知道民主与社会主义的力量是必然走向胜利之路的。
    凡是有正义感的人们一定会与这个伟大的斗争结合在一起，因为这个斗争燃起了整个进步人类的火焰。向着和平与幸福前进的各民族是任何势力所不能抗拒的。帝国主义者们在他们的面前发抖了，华尔街大老板们的疯狂计划的假面具是被揭穿了，他们过去一直是梦想以战争和统治使世界变成他们的殖民地。
    法国、英国和荷兰的母亲们！帝国主义者把你们的孩子送上前线，以便拿残酷的战争来强迫我们服从他们的统治；他们迫使你们的孩子为帝国主义的掠夺目的而白白地送死。
    美国的母亲们！你们的工厂所制造的坦克和飞机烧毁着我们的村庄，毁灭着我们贫乏的生活资料，屠杀着我们的孩子们，加强着我们生活的恐怖。
    你们的政府为了在印尼、越南、马来亚、缅甸、中国所进行的战争和为了在伊朗、印度、朝鲜南部及其他国家内的残暴压迫所用的金钱，都是从你们口袋里偷来的。
    亲爱的姐妹们！不要忘记，凡是压迫其他民族的民族，自己决不能成为自由的民族！
    你们同样担负着帝国主义战争的重担。在你们的国家里，军事预算正在不断的膨胀，你们的生活水平正在不断的降低，失业的人数一天比一天增加。为了镇压你们对于反动统治和新战争准备的反抗，你们的政府日益限制和剥夺你们的权利；因而，在你们的国家中，民主已经变成了空话。
    妇女们，母亲们！当心着！除非你们坚决地出来反对你们政府这种帝国主义的战争政策，不然你们的生活水准将更低落，而战争危机将会增涨起来。
    帝国主义者想在我们之间掘出一条仇恨与欺骗的鸿沟，不要相信他们！
    如同你们一样，我们爱着我们自己的孩子们，并且热望看到他们是幸福的！因此，任何力量都不能从我们心里拔除我们对自由和民族独立的热爱。
    我们爱我们的祖国，希望看到它们的自由和繁荣。我们以我们国家的几千年的历史对人类文明的贡献而自豪。
    在今天的亚洲，已经有千百万我们的姐妹们获得了解放。我们亲眼看到，我们最宝贵的愿望已经在苏联实现。而在亚细亚共和国，这些沙皇昔日的殖民地现在已经变成了繁荣的国家。在那里，积极参加新社会建设的妇女们，是自己丈夫的平等的伴侣和孩子们幸福的母亲。
    亚洲的人民共和国，一个接着一个地建立起来了。蒙古、伟大的中国、朝鲜、和越南解放区，她们已经在建立新的社会，这个社会向妇女们开辟了走向幸福的道路。
    在亚洲，每个赢得自由的国家都是新的和平的堡垒。中国革命的胜利把中国人民从战争贩子的统治之下解放出来了，并把中国变为和平民主的堡垒。
    我们深知我们为祖国主权完整而斗争的伟大意义。我们相信，全世界妇女的伟大团结，将对我们这一斗争有极大帮助。国际民主妇女联合会就是我们友谊团结的一个活生生的体现。
    美国、英国、法国和荷兰的妇女们！我们的斗争是艰苦的。我们向你们呼吁。加强你们同我们的团结！
    不要作刽子手的同谋者！你们要大声疾呼，揭穿他们的罪行。
    不要让我们的孩子们互相残杀！要求停止殖民地战争！要求你们的政府从越南、印尼、马来亚、缅甸、朝鲜撤退驻军！以全力要求你们的政府停止干涉亚洲各国的事务！支持在联合国内一切有利于亚洲各民族独立事业的建议！要求缩减军备，并且禁止原子武器！
    加强你们国家里为真正民主的斗争！你们对帝国主义斗争的每一个胜利，都是我们的胜利！
    为了全世界的巩固与持久的和平，为了各民族人民的友谊，为了再不会有奴隶制度的、为和平与正义所普照的光明的未来，你们和我们一起斗争吧！
    全世界妇女团结万岁！
