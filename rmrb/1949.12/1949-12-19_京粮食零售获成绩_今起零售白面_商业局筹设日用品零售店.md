  　Commerce Bureau Prepares to Establish Retail Stores for Daily Necessities
    [Beijing News] This month, in the first ten days, Beijing's grain retail stores sold a total of 1,831,200+ catties of grain, ensuring the livelihood of the working people. 200,000 grain purchase certificates have been issued to citizens, and distribution is still ongoing. The price of grain in retail stores is more than 10% lower than the general market price. For example, the retail price of millet in retail stores is 520 yuan per catty, while the market price is 620 yuan; the retail price of sorghum is 630 yuan per catty, while the market price is 750 yuan; the retail price of millet flour and prostrate corn flour is 580 yuan per catty, while the market price is 650 yuan. To cater to citizens eating refined grains for the New Year, each retail store has decided to sell white flour starting today, with each person allowed to buy three catties.
    [Beijing News] In order to facilitate citizens' purchase of daily necessities and to avoid exploitation by merchants, the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau plans to establish twelve major retail stores for daily necessities in bustling districts, selling grain, cloth, coal, salt, general merchandise, etc. Preparations have already begun, and the stores are scheduled to open by the end of this month.
