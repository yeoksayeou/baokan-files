　　Moscow-Donbas Railway Line
　　Widely Launches Socialist Competition
　　Saving Over 10 Million Rubles Beyond Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th: Moscow Dispatch: Due to the extensive mobilization of labor competition and the organization of loading and unloading work according to a unified technical process, the workers and staff of the Moscow-Donbas Railway Line have completed their pledges ahead of schedule and have greatly exceeded them. They had guaranteed that this year they would transport 14,000 more carloads of coal than planned, that the freight car turnaround rate would be accelerated by two hours compared to the stipulated time, that labor productivity would exceed the plan by 2.5 percent, that fuel consumption would be reduced by 3.5 percent compared to the standard, and that freight costs would be reduced by 2 percent compared to the plan. Now, these pledges have not only been completed ahead of schedule but have been greatly exceeded. As of Stalin Constitution Day (December 5th), the car turnaround rate had been accelerated by 2.9 hours compared to the plan for this year, labor productivity exceeded the plan by 6.7 percent, fuel consumption was reduced by 13.6 percent, and freight costs were reduced by 6.4 percent. The railway line has saved a total of 10.5 million rubles more than planned. The greater capital turnover rate has made it possible to free up 5 million rubles of working capital. The reason the railway personnel were able to achieve these successes is due to the widespread launch of socialist competition, and the organization of the work of stations and mine sidings and the sidings of other enterprises according to a unified technical process, enabling railway personnel to coordinate coal loading and unloading (which is the main freight transport of this railway). The movement of locomotive drivers making trains travel 500 kilometers or more per day greatly helps to ensure the timely loading and transportation of goods to power stations, factories, and cities.

　　莫斯科—顿巴斯铁路线
  　广泛展开社会主义竞赛
    超过计划节省千万卢布
    【新华社北京十一日电】莫斯科讯：由于广泛地发动劳动竞赛，由于按照统一的技术过程组织装运工作，莫斯科——顿巴斯铁路线的工人和职员们，已提前完成了他们所提出的保证，并且还大大地超过了。他们曾保证今年要超计划多运一万四千车煤，货车运转率要比规定的时间加速两小时，使劳动生产率超出计划百分之二点五，使燃料消耗比标准规定减少百分之三点五，使货运成本比计划规定减少百分之二。现在，这些保证不仅已提前完成并大大超过了。到斯大林宪法日（十二月五日）为止，车厢的运转率已比今年计划的规定加速了二点九小时，劳动生产率超出计划百分之六点七，燃料消费减少了百分之十三点六，货运成本减少了百分之六点四。该铁路线总共超过计划多节省了一千零五十万卢布。更大的资金周转率，使得有可能腾出了五百万卢布的流动资金。该铁路人员之所以能获得这些成就，是由于广泛地展开了社会主义竞赛，是由于按照统一的技术过程，组织车站与矿场边线及其他企业的边线的工作，使铁路人员能够协调地装煤与卸煤（这是这条铁路的主要货运）。机车司机使火车每日行走五百公里或五百公里以上的运动，大大有助于保证及时装载与运送货物到动力站、工厂与城市。
