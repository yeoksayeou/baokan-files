    Mr. Minister and dear comrades:

    On behalf of all the delegates to the Asian Women's Conference, we want to express to you the infinite excitement we felt during our stay in democratic China.

    As we return to our respective countries, we will, following the example of our Chinese sisters, strengthen our struggle to achieve our common goals: that is, to strive for just and lasting peace and respect for the independence of every nation, no matter where in the world.

    Mr. Minister and dear comrades, we hereby express our gratitude to you and our friendship to the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic.

    Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier
