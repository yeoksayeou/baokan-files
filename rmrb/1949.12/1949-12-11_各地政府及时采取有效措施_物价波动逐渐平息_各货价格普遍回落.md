Local Governments Take Timely and Effective Measures
	Price Fluctuations Gradually Subside
	Prices of Various Goods Generally Decline

[This newspaper reports] The recent price fluctuation across the country (excluding the Northeast), which began in mid-to-late October, lasted for more than a month and has generally declined this week.

This round of price increases began in the North China region, with rising grain prices due to grain shortages being the direct cause. North China suffered more severe disasters this year, resulting in poor harvests. At the same time, the cotton field area expanded, and the area of grain crops decreased accordingly, causing a grain shortage. After the new cotton came onto the market in late September and early October, grain prices in the inland areas of Pingyuan and Hebei provinces began to rise as the vast number of cotton farmers sold cotton to buy grain. From September 30th to October 10th, in just ten days in Xinxiang, millet rose from 146 yuan to 167 yuan per catty, and wheat rose from 154 yuan to 175 yuan. In Shijiazhuang, millet rose from 135 yuan to 168 yuan per catty, and wheat rose from 155 yuan to 180 yuan. This resulted in an abnormal phenomenon where grain prices in rural areas were higher than in Beijing and Tianjin. After grain prices rose, cotton and cloth prices also followed, and after mid-October, prices of various goods in Beijing and Tianjin also began to rise, fluctuating sharply by early November. After prices rose in North China, Shanghai's prices also increased, led by cotton cloth. Subsequently, prices in Central China and Northwest China also generally rose.

The fundamental reason for this round of price fluctuations was that the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure could not be offset due to the large-scale revolutionary war and economic recovery work, resulting in a considerable deficit, and thus an increase in banknote issuance. Market speculation and profiteering by unscrupulous merchants, as well as temporary imbalances in supply and demand, also contributed to the price increases.

Main Measures:
	Freezing Cash of Public Enterprises and Institutions
	Strengthening Market Management and Cracking Down on Speculation
	Unified Allocation of Materials and Large-Scale Sales
	Increasing Retail Stores to Supply Necessities

In response to the above reasons, after the price fluctuations, the financial and economic organs of the people's governments at all levels, under the direct and unified command of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, took the following effective measures to stabilize prices: (1) Freezing the cash of various public enterprises and institutions, and suspending various non-urgent expenditures to tighten the currency; (2) Strengthening market management and severely cracking down on speculative activities. In response to the demands of the broad masses of people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government arrested and brought to justice on November 13th the unscrupulous merchants, Wang Zhenting, Tian Yuchuan, Tian Bolin, and Qu Yueting, who habitually engaged in speculation and hoarding, driving up prices, and profiteering. On November 16th, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government also arrested the owners of seven rice stores, Qingfeng, Yuantai, Tianshengfu, and Luxin, who were driving up grain prices and making huge profits, and gave them different punishments and education; on November 25th, more than 20 underground money shops were investigated and banned. With the support and assistance of the broad masses of people, other local people's governments also carried out effective crackdowns on market speculation. (3) State-owned trading companies and transportation agencies in various regions of the country planned and rapidly allocated large quantities of major materials such as grain, yarn, cloth, coal, salt, and cotton to each other and sold them in large quantities in local markets. The quantity of major materials sold by China's state-owned trading companies in the market in November, taking Beijing and Tianjin as examples, was as follows: Tianjin sold 44,445,000 catties of coarse grains, 17,774,000 catties of fine grains, 135,468 bolts of various cloths, and more than 3,000 pieces of yarn; Beijing sold 20,070,000 catties of coarse grains, 17,750,000 catties of fine grains, 77,837 bolts of cloth, and 19,599 bundles of yarn. In addition, in order to guarantee the basic life of the broad masses of working people and prevent them from suffering great losses in price fluctuations, state-owned trading companies in Beijing and Tianjin increased the number of retail and consignment stores for grain, and reorganized retail and consignment stores for yarn and cloth, selling grain and cloth to citizens at prices lower than the market price. Currently, the number of grain consignment stores in Tianjin has increased to 640, and 37 new yarn and cloth consignment stores have been established; the number of grain retail consignment stores in Beijing has increased to 107, and more than 10 new yarn and cloth consignment stores have been established. The people's governments of Beijing and Tianjin are now organizing a large number of retail stores directly supplying grain, oil, salt, cloth, and other necessities, in order to directly supply the daily necessities of the broad masses of citizens and eliminate the exploitation by merchants in the middle.

Due to the various major measures taken by the People's Government, prices in various parts of the country have generally declined since the beginning of this month. Comparing November 25th with December 7th, the percentage decrease in the prices of various goods is as follows: Shanghai: rice 13.1, flour 18, cotton 14, 20-count yarn 15, Longtou fine cloth 14, cooking oil 16, coal 26, salt 16; Hankou: rice 18, flour 12, cotton 16, 20-count yarn 18, cloth 19, cooking oil 28, salt 26; Xi'an: rice 5, cotton 6, 20-count yarn 5, cloth 9, salt 6, coal 9, flour and cooking oil are both flat; Beijing's 20-count yarn fell by 17 percent, cloth by 11 percent, cooking oil by 6 percent, cotton and salt are both flat, corn rose by 1 percent, Fudi millet rose by 4 percent, and flour rose by 13 percent (Beijing's grain prices, especially flour prices, are lower than other cities, so trading companies actively adjusted them); the percentage decline in prices of various goods in Tianjin is: corn 7, millet 6.4, flour 1.1, cotton 12.3, 20-count yarn 15, Erchang Wufu cloth 13, cooking oil 5, salt 21. In recent weeks, prices in rural areas have also begun to generally decline due to the large-scale sales of materials and the adjustment of supply and demand by trading companies.

### 各地政府及时采取有效措施　物价波动逐渐平息　各货价格普遍回落

　　各地政府及时采取有效措施
  　物价波动逐渐平息
  　各货价格普遍回落
    【本报讯】全国物价（不包括东北，下同）自十月中下旬开始的最近一次波动，持续了一个多月，本旬已普遍回落。
    这次物价上涨首先开始于华北区，而直接的导因则是由于粮食缺乏而造成的粮食价格上涨。华北区今年灾情较重，粮食歉收，同时棉田面积扩大，粮食作物面积也相应减少，造成了粮食缺乏现象。九月下旬十月上旬新花上市后，随着广大棉农的卖棉买粮，平原、河北两省内地粮价即开始上涨。由九月三十日到十月十日，十天里新乡，小米每斤由一四六元涨至一六七元，小麦由一五四元涨至一七五元。石家庄小米每斤由一三五元涨至一六八元，小麦由一五五元涨至一八○元。结果形成了农村粮价高于京津两市的反常现象。粮价上涨后，棉花、纱布价格也跟着涨起来，至十月中旬以后，京津两市各货价格也开始上涨，至十一月上旬即剧烈波动。华北物价上涨后，上海物价即以纱布带头尾随上提；接着华中、西北各区物价也都普遍上升。
    这次物价波动的基本原因，是大规模的革命战争和经济恢复工作所引起的政府财政收支不能相抵，赤字相当庞大，因此钞票发行增加。而市场游资冲击，奸商乘机进行投机活动和物资供求暂时的失调等，也助长了物价的上涨。
    主要措施
    冻结公营企业机关现款
    加强市场管理取缔投机
    统一调拨物资大量抛售
    增设零售店供应必需品
    针对上述原因，当物价波动后，各地各级人民政府财政经济机关，在中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会的直接统一指挥下，采取了以下各种平稳物价的有效措施：（一）冻结各公营企业机关的现款，停发各项不急需的开支，借以紧缩通货；（二）加强市场管理，严厉取缔投机活动。根据广大人民的要求，北京市人民政府，于十一月十三日将惯以投机囤积、哄抬物价、暴利自肥的“粮老虎”王振廷、田雨川、田柏林、曲跃亭等奸商逮捕法办。上海市人民政府亦于十一月十六日，将庆丰、源泰、天盛福、陆新等七家哄抬粮价牟取暴利的米店老板逮捕，分别予以处分、教育；十一月二十五日复将二十余家地下钱庄予以查获取缔。其他各地人民政府在广大人民的支持协助下，对市场投机活动，亦进行了有效的取缔。（三）各地国营贸易公司及交通运输机关，有计划地迅速地在全国各区互相调拨了大量粮、纱、布、煤、盐、棉花等主要物资，在各地市场上大量抛售。十一月份我国营贸易公司在市场上抛售的主要物资数量，以京津两市为例，天津市卖出了粗粮四千四百四十四万五千斤，细粮一千七百七十七万四千斤，各种布十三万五千四百六十八匹，纱三千多件；北京市卖出了粗粮二千零七万斤，细粮一千七百七十五万斤，布七万七千八百三十七匹，纱一万九千五百九十九捆。此外为保证广大劳动人民的基本生活，使他们在物价波动中不受很大损失，京津两市的国营贸易公司，增加了粮食零售代销店的数目，并且重新组织了纱布零售代销店，以低于市价的价格向市民出售粮食、纱布。计目前天津的粮食代销店已增至六百四十户，纱布代销店新设了三十七户；北京市粮食零售代销店已增至一百零七户，纱布代销店新设了十余户。现京津两市人民政府又正在大量直接组织粮、油、盐、布等供给零售店，以便今后直接供给广大市民的生活必需品，免除商人的中间剥削。
    由于人民政府采取了以上各种主要措施，本月初旬以来全国各地物价已普遍回落。以十一月二十五日与十二月七日比较，各贷价格下跌的百分比如下：上海：大米十三点一，面粉十八，棉花十四，二十支纱十五，龙头细布十四，食油十六，煤二十六，食盐十六；汉口：大米十八，面粉十二，棉花十六，二十支纱十八，布十九，食油二十八，食盐二十六；西安：大米五，棉花六，二十支纱五，布九，食盐六，煤九，面粉和食油皆平；北京二十支纱下跌了百分之十七，布百分之十一，食油百分之六，棉花食盐皆平，玉米上升了百分之一，伏地小米上升了百分之四，面粉上升了百分之十三（北京粮价特别是面粉价格较其他城市为低，因此贸易公司主动加以调整）；天津各货价格回落的百分比为：玉米七，小米六点四，面粉一点一，棉花十二点三，二十支纱十五，二厂五福布十三，食油五，食盐二十一。各地农村物价，近周来也因贸易公司大量抛售物资，调剂供求后，已开始普遍回落。
