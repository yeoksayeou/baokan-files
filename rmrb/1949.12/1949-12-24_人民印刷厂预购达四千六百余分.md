    [This newspaper's dispatch] The workers and staff of the China People's Printing Plant are enthusiastically launching a campaign to pre-subscribe to the People's Victory Discount Bond. As of the 23rd, 3,053 people have voluntarily registered with the plant's trade union to subscribe to the Victory Bonds, and the number of subscriptions has reached 4,634 shares. Many workers and staff are still registering to subscribe. All 130-plus workers in the entire platemaking department have registered to subscribe, and six people have each subscribed to 20 shares.
