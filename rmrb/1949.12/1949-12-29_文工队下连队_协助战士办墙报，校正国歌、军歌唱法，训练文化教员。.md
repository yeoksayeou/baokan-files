　　Performing Arts Troupe Goes to the Company Level
    Assisting Soldiers in Creating Wall Newspapers, Correcting the Singing of the National Anthem and Military Songs, and Training Cultural Instructors.
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The performing arts troupe of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Baoding City, in order to assist companies in carrying out recreational activities and to allow troupe members to deeply experience the life of soldiers, dispatched all cadre members (except female comrades) to various companies to work, starting from October 10th. In the course of fifty days, considerable achievements were made. In all units where the performing arts troupe went, the singing of the National Anthem and military songs were uniformly corrected, so that all companies sang in unison. At the same time, according to statistics from four large units, nineteen new songs were taught to the soldiers, of which six songs were created by comrades of the performing arts troupe after going to the company level in conjunction with their work.
    Comrades of the performing arts troupe also assisted companies in creating wall newspapers, mobilizing and helping soldiers to write articles and draw pictures, and writing on behalf of soldiers who were unable to write, encouraging soldiers to learn to submit articles. For example, the group that went to the "Establish the Nation" unit helped soldiers produce twenty-four issues of wall newspapers, achieving the requirement of "soldiers create, soldiers read," coordinating with and promoting the central work of the company, and reflecting the lives and studies of the soldiers.
    In order to lay the foundation for recreational activities at the company level, the comrades of the performing arts troupe, based on the specific conditions of each unit, systematically cultivated literary and artistic backbones, and ran small training classes; in the camp, they organized a cultural instructor training group, explaining basic knowledge of music, painting, etc., and using them to carry out recreational activities in the troops. They also provided strong guidance for the "soldier-acting-soldier" movement at the company level, helping with scriptwriting and rehearsals.
    During this period, because all comrades of the performing arts troupe experienced the life of soldiers, or processed soldiers' creations, they created a total of sixteen scripts, thirty-five songs, three sets of slides, as well as drum lyrics, comic strips, and other types of works. Although these works are still very rough, they all reflect the actual lives of the soldiers. In addition, the comrades of the performing arts troupe learned the simple and hardworking style from the soldiers, became familiar with some military common sense, and developed the habit of observing rules and following orders. The relationship between the performing arts troupe and the soldiers is also closer, and the soldiers said: "The comrades of the performing arts troupe are our good friends."

　　文工队下连队
    协助战士办墙报，校正国歌、军歌唱法，训练文化教员。
    【本报讯】驻保定市的人民解放军某部文工队，为协助连队开展文娱工作，并使队员深入体验战士生活，于十月十日起全体干部队员（除女同志外）均分赴各连队工作。在五十天的时间内，收到了相当成绩。凡是文工队去的单位，都统一校正了国歌、军歌的唱法，使各连都唱得一致；同时，据四个大单位统计，教会战士新歌十九个，其中有六个歌是文工队同志下连后结合工作创作的。
    文工队同志并协助连队办墙报，发动并帮助战士写稿、画图，并替不会写的战士代笔，鼓励战士学习投稿。如去“建国”部的小组，帮助战士出墙报二十四期，作到了“战士办、战士看”的要求，配合并推动了连队的中心工作，反映了战士的生活与学习。
    为了打下连队文娱工作基础，文工队同志根据各单位具体情况，有计划的培养文艺骨干，办了小型的集训班；在营里组织了文化教员训练组，讲解音乐、绘画等的基本知识，通过他们来开展部队文娱工作。并对连队“兵演兵”运动作了有力指导，帮助编剧、排演等。
    在此期间，全文工队同志因为体会了战士生活，或把战士创作加工，共创作了剧本十六个，歌子三十五个、大洋片三套，以及鼓词、连环画等多种。这些作品虽然还很粗糙，但都是反映战士实际生活的。此外，文工队同志们向战士学习了朴实刻苦的作风，熟悉了一些军事常识，并养成遵守制度，听从号令的习惯。文工队与战士的关系也更密切了，战士们说：“文工队的同志，是我们的好朋友。”
