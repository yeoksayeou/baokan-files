Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th: Ms. Yser Rabesahala, a women's representative from Madagascar, spoke at the Asian Women's Representatives Conference on the morning of the 13th in the capacity of a guest, stating in brief:

　　Madagascar is a nation with its own language, traditions, and territory, but the rule of the imperialists is oppressing the people more and more severely. The entire economy of Madagascar is monopolized by a few large companies. In order to obtain profits, these large companies must, of course, exploit the people of Madagascar as much as possible. Just look at the poverty of the people of Madagascar! Flour is simply a luxury for children, so many children die very young, or they are hunchbacked and rickety due to malnutrition. Some say that the situation in Madagascar is much better than before the French imperialists occupied it in 1896. This is not true for the masses of the people and the workers. At that time, a worker's daily wage was equivalent to five kilograms of rice, while now a day's wage is only two kilograms of rice.

　　In terms of culture and society, the policy of obscurantism still exists in Madagascar. Before the French occupied this place, there were 160,000 elementary school students, but now there are only 104,000. However, there are 800,000 children of school age.

　　However, the area where the oppression of the colonialists is most fierce is in the political aspect. In 1946, the independence movement called the "Madagascar Revival Democratic Movement" was joined by three-quarters of the entire people, including women. The ruling authorities then began to suppress it. Leaders were arrested and imprisoned, subjected to torture; three leaders, members of the French National Assembly, were also arrested, two were executed, and 90,000 Malagasy people were subjected to severe torture, shooting, and death without trial. At the same time, special decrees stipulated that freedom of publication, assembly, association, and freedom were completely deprived—until today. There are still three thousand prisoners in unsanitary prisons awaiting trial. They have been waiting for three years. When the Supreme Court was about to try the "Tananarive case," the former French Overseas Minister Coste-Floret put pressure on the prosecutor, and the appeal had to be abandoned. Therefore, the common task before the people of Madagascar and the people of France is: to retry the Tananarive case; to immediately release all those arrested; and to abolish the "special decrees."

　　The struggle for bread, for land, and for national independence is not afraid of any oppression. Workers in factories strike to increase wages; political prisoners go on hunger strikes to improve food in prison; farmers send representatives to petition the provincial government because the colonists have seized their land.

　　The struggle for national independence is deeply rooted in the hearts of the women of Madagascar. One female comrade said with dignity to her executioners: "The French love their motherland, and I, I also love my motherland."

　　The women of Madagascar long for peace, because the struggle for peace is the struggle for national liberation and independence. The women of Madagascar hope to build schools and nurseries, and do not want to build strategic highways.

　　But the women of Madagascar know that only by uniting with women all over the world who oppose imperialism and colonialism can they achieve those wishes.

　　Madagascar's participation in the Women's International Democratic Federation is a victory for us. The closer union and solidarity between the women of Madagascar and the women of France is even more commendable. If we unite in this way, we will surely be victorious in the battle for peace, freedom, and happiness.

### 马达加斯加来宾拉贝萨哈拉发言

　　马达加斯加来宾拉贝萨哈拉发言
    【新华社北京十四日电】十三日上午马达加斯加妇女代表叶赛尔·拉贝萨哈拉以来宾资格，在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言，略称：
    马达加斯加是一个有自己语言、传统和领土的民族，但帝国主义者的统治却一天紧似一天地压迫着人民。整个马达加斯加的经济是被几个大公司所垄断。各大公司为了获取利润，当然必须尽量剥削马达加斯加的人民。请看看马达加斯加人民的贫困吧！面粉对于儿童简直是一种奢侈品，因此很多儿童很小就死亡了，不然因为营养不良也是驼背佝传。有人说马达加斯加的情形比一八九六年在法帝国主义占领以前好了许多。这话对人民大众及工人来说是不真实的。在那时工人一天的工资相当于五公斤米，而现在一天的工资不过两斤米罢了。
    在文化和社会方面，愚民政策在马达加斯加照样存在。在法国未占领这地方以前，有十六万个小学生，现在却只有十万零四千了。而达到学龄儿童的却有八十万。
    不过殖民者的压迫表示得最凶猛的地方，还是政治方面。在一九四六年，人们称作“马达加斯加复兴民主运动”的独立运动，全人民的四分之三包括妇女在内全都参加了。统治当局就开始了镇压。领导人被捕下狱，遭受酷刑；法国国会议员三个领袖也横遭逮捕，两个被处死，九万马达加斯加人不经审问遭受了严刑、枪杀、死亡。同时特别法令规定了出版、集会、结社、自由完全被剥夺——直到今天。现在仍有三千个囚犯在不卫生的监狱里听候着审判。他们已经等了三年了。当最高法院要审判这个“达纳拿里夫案”时，前法国海外部长高士得——弗劳来就向检查官施以压力，上诉只得作罢。因此马达加斯加人民和法国人民面前的共同任务是：重审达纳拿里夫案；立刻释放所有被捕的人；废除“特别法令”。
    为面包、为土地、为民族独立的斗争是不怕任何压迫的。工厂的工人为增加工资而罢工；政治犯为了狱中食物改善而绝食；农民派代表为了殖民者强占了他们的土地向省政府请愿。
    为民族独立的斗争，是深深种在马达加斯加妇女的心里的。一位女同志尊严地向她的刽子手说：“法兰西人爱他们的祖国，我，我也爱我的祖国。”
    马达加斯加妇女渴望和平，因为为和平的斗争，就是民族解放独立的斗争。马达加斯加妇女希望建立学校、保育院，并不希望建筑战略性公路。
    但是马达加斯加的妇女深知只有和全世界反帝国主义殖民主义的妇女们联合起来她们才能达到那些愿望。
    马达加斯加参加国际民主妇联，对我们是一个胜利。马达加斯加妇女和法国妇女更密切地联合团结，是更可祝贺的，我们这样团结起来，我们必定能在和平、自由、幸福的战斗中获得胜利。
