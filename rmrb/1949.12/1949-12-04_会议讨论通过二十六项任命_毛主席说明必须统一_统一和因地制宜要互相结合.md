　　Conference Approves Twenty-Six Appointments
    Chairman Mao Explains the Necessity of Unity
    Unity and Adapting to Local Conditions Must be Combined
    The fourth item on the agenda of the conference was to discuss and approve twenty-six appointments, including the newly established East China Military and Political Committee (governing the six provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Taiwan), the Central South Military and Political Committee (governing the original Central China region's Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and South China's Guangdong and Guangxi, a total of six provinces), the Northwest Military and Political Committee (governing the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang), the Southwest Military and Political Committee (governing the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xikang), and the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee and the list of provincial people's government personnel. Before discussing these appointment lists, Premier Zhou Enlai explained that these lists had been fully consulted with all relevant parties. Premier Zhou also stated that some of these lists were not yet complete and would be supplemented when conditions permitted and required. Chairman Mao then elaborated on the establishment of the military and political committees in these major administrative regions. Chairman Mao said that China is a large country, and it is necessary to establish such a level of powerful local organizations to handle matters well. What should be unified must be unified, and no one is allowed to act on their own; but unity and adapting to local conditions must be combined. Under the people's regime, the historical conditions that produced feudal separatism like in the past have been eliminated, and the appropriate division of labor between the central and local governments will be beneficial and harmless. The conference unanimously approved the twenty-six appointments.

　　会议讨论通过二十六项任命
    毛主席说明必须统一
    统一和因地制宜要互相结合
    会议的第四项议程是讨论通过二十六项任命，其中包括新设立的华东军政委员会（辖山东、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、台湾六省、）中南军政委员会（辖原华中区的河南、湖北、江西、湖南和华南的广东、广西共六省）、西北军政委员会（辖陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、新疆五省）、西南军政委员会（辖四川、贵州、云南、西康省）和绥远军政委员会及省人民政府名单。在讨论这些任命名单以前，周恩来总理说明这些名单曾经经过有关各方面的充分协商。周总理并且说明，这些名单中有些还不是完备的，在情况允许和需要时，还将加以补充。毛主席接着就这几个大行政区的军政委员会的设立，加以说明。毛主席说，中国是一个大国，必须设立这样一级的有力量的地方机构，才能把事情办好。应该统一的，必须统一，决不许可各自为政；但是统一和因地制宜必须互相结合。在人民的政权下，产生象过去那样的封建割据的历史条件已经消灭了，中央和地方的适当的分工将有利而无害。会议一致通过了二十六项任命。
