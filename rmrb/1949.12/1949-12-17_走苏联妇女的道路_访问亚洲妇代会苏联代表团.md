　　Following the Path of Soviet Women
  　A Visit to the Soviet Delegation to the Asian Women's Conference

    From the distant, snowy Moscow, from the vast and fertile Kyrgyz steppes, from the Kazakhstan filled with the melodious sounds of the dombra (Kazakh zither), from the Turkmenistan overflowing with red wine and black oil, and from the cotton-filled fields of Uzbekistan, the Soviet delegation to the Asian Women's Conference in Beijing included the outstanding female teacher Bafinova, the Soviet Union's first female driver Truiitskaya, the Minister of Social Insurance of the Turkmen Republic, Apenipesova, the Hero of Socialist Labor of the Uzbek Republic, Ubaidullaeva, the Head of the Physiology Department of the Almaty Veterinary Institute of the Kazakh Republic, Professor Bachanova, and the editor of the Kyrgyz Republic's Children's Newspaper, Kuriba Toktomanbetova.

    When we see this delegation from the world's happiest country, with the most glorious achievements and honors for women in the world, we seem to see behind them the millions upon millions of Soviet mothers and daughters who are gloriously and happily working, learning, and living. As delegation leader Bafinova said, their happiness is inseparable from the emergence of Soviet society; among them, whether it is Truiitskaya, the daughter of a railway worker, or Apenipesova of Turkmenistan, where only seven people could read before the revolution, without the victory of the October Revolution, without the victory of the Soviet laboring people's liberation struggle, in no way could the glory of being a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the glory of being a third-class railway general equivalent to a major general, the glory of being a government minister of the Turkmen Republic have fallen upon them. The truth that women's liberation is inseparable from the liberation of the working people educates and guides women all over the world to advance in this correct direction.

    "The liberated women in one country must continue to struggle for the liberation of all mankind." Bafinova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, explained the truth that Soviet women deeply realized when Fascist Germany attacked the Soviet Union. World peace and human happiness are inseparable. When happy and peaceful Soviet women were creating a happier life for themselves and the next generation of children beside tractors, lathes in factories, and classrooms in schools, Fascist Germany perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, destroying the happiness they had created themselves. Under Stalin's call, they took up guns in the front and rear, set up tractors, and waged a calm and tenacious struggle against the enemy. Victory belonged to the women of the Soviet Union, and Soviet women therefore fully understood that only by achieving the liberation of all mankind can true world peace be guaranteed. In this way, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee actively initiated and participated in the organization of the International Democratic Women's Federation, actively supported the struggle for national liberation in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and actively supported the struggle of women in capitalist countries against imperialist wars; together with peace-loving women all over the world, they fought against imperialism and fought to protect the rights of women and children. At the same time, Soviet women vigorously participated in the economic and cultural construction of the Soviet Union, strengthening and consolidating the socialist Soviet Union, which is also strengthening the work of defending world peace.

    The advanced experience of our Soviet sisters is worthy of our efforts to learn from. Soviet women have already overcome the backwardness in women's work and study caused by historical and social oppression. Comrade Trutskaia's deeds are a good example. As the daughter of a railway worker, after studying at a school established in the factory, she tried to do a job that women had never tried to do before - repairing locomotives and being an assistant train driver. At that time, she was a bold girl of eighteen. Her actions were valued and helped by the Soviet government, and two doctors were appointed to guard her, protect her health, and examine whether women could take on this aspect of the work. Trutskaia proved this with her own success. From then on, the Soviet government opened women's driver training classes to train women drivers. Trutskaia continued to advance in technology and business, and received the Lenin Medal in 1936, when she was twenty-three years old. The following year, she became the first female train driver in the Soviet Union. She was the first to propose the establishment of women's driving groups, composed of a driver, an assistant, and a stoker, responsible for maintaining the speed, cleanliness, driving safety, and lifespan of the vehicle, becoming the initial prototype of the crew responsibility system. During the Anti-Fascist War, she worked on military vehicles, and because of her courageous and fearless guarantee of supplies to the front line, she won the Medal for Heroic Labor and the Red Banner Medal. In 1943, she was awarded the rank of third-class railway general, equivalent to a major general. Now she is the deputy director of the Moscow Subway Administration.

    Tens of thousands of outstanding women in the Soviet Union, like Trutskaia, bravely opened the door to all jobs for themselves and for all mankind, and the Soviet government and the great leader Stalin lovingly encouraged and helped them. Now, women participate in various work departments in the Soviet Union, female miners, female technicians, female ship captains, female pilots, female scientists... 350,000 women serve as chairpersons and team leaders of collective farms, and factory directors and team leaders. Ubaidullaeva, the Hero of Socialist Labor in the delegation, is one of them; there are more than one million female teachers in the Soviet Union, outstanding ones like the head of the delegation, Bafinova, who serves as the vice-chairman of the International Federation of Teachers' Associations; the Soviet Union has 280,000 female engineers, professors and experts, one of whom is Professor Bachanova, who leads independent academic research work; one hundred and eight women in the Soviet Union have become ministers and department heads, just like Apenipesova, the Minister of Social Insurance of the Turkmen Republic who came this time.

    Working and constantly learning, constantly advancing, this is the close advice of our beloved Soviet sisters to the thousands of working and struggling Chinese women. Apenipesova in the delegation, she is a minister of the Turkmen Republic, and at the same time a third-year student of a higher school. Their continuous learning and continuous progress is the best example for Chinese women.

    They happily talked about how Soviet women not only dedicate their wisdom, talents, and labor to the country, but also very happily take on the special contribution of women to the motherland - giving birth to and raising the next generation of children. At the same time, the socialist country of the Soviet Union has also established tens of thousands of nurseries and kindergartens, free seven-year schools, well-equipped children's palaces of culture and playgrounds, and takes care of children's education and welfare very thoughtfully, so that mothers can fully engage in work with peace of mind. The head of the delegation happily told reporters that she has a daughter who is a member of the Youth League and a son who is a Young Pioneer, the Minister of Social Insurance has three children, Professor Bachanova has two children, and the general of the Moscow Subway Administration also has a daughter. In the Soviet Union, children are no longer an obstacle to the work and life of mothers. On the contrary, due to the conscious responsibility of mothers and the socialist motherland's utmost care for mothers and children, it has become a source of making the lives of Soviet women more fulfilling and happier.

　　走苏联妇女的道路
  　访问亚洲妇代会苏联代表团
    金凤
    从辽远的积雪的莫斯科，从广漠的丰肥的吉尔吉斯草原，从飘荡着东不拉（哈萨克琴名）悠扬音调的哈萨克，从流溢着红色葡萄酒和黑色石油的吐克曼，从田野里满布着棉花的乌兹别克来到北京出席亚洲妇代大会的苏联代表团中，包括了出色的女教员巴菲诺娃，苏联第一个女司机特鲁伊茨卡娅，吐克曼共和国社会保险部部长阿培尼佩索娃，乌兹别克共和国社会主义劳动英雄乌巴伊杜拉耶娃，哈萨克共和国阿拉木图兽医研究所生理系主任巴查诺娃教授和吉尔吉斯共和国儿童报编辑库里巴·托克托曼别托娃。
    当我们看到这一个来自全世界最幸福国度的，有着全世界妇女最光辉的成就和荣誉的代表团，我们就仿佛看到了在她们后面的千千万万光荣而幸福地工作着、学习着和生活着的苏联的母亲们和女儿们。正如代表团团长巴菲诺娃所说，她们的幸福是和苏维埃社会的产生分不开的；她们中间，不论是铁路职员的女儿特鲁伊茨卡娅，不论是革命前只有七个识字者的吐克曼的阿培尼佩索娃，如果没有十月革命的胜利，如果没有苏联劳动人民解放斗争的胜利，无论如何，这苏联最高苏维埃代表的光荣，这相当于陆军少将的铁路三级将军的光荣，这吐克曼共和国政府部长的光荣是不可能落在她们身上的。妇女的解放是和劳动人民的解放不可分割的真理，教育着和指导着全世界的妇女们向着这一正确的方向前进。
    “一个国家中解放了的妇女必须继续奋斗以求得全人类的解放。”苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席巴菲诺娃，说明着苏联的妇女们在法西斯德国进攻苏联时所深深体会到的这个真理。世界的和平与人类幸福是不可分割的，当幸福的和平的苏联妇女在拖拉机旁，在工厂的车床边，在学校的课堂里创造着她们和下一代孩子们的更幸福的生活时，法西斯德国背信进攻苏联，破坏了她们自己创造的幸福。她们在斯大林的号召之下，在前方和后方，拿起了枪，架起拖拉机，和敌人进行着沉着的顽强的斗争。胜利属于苏联的妇女，苏联妇女因此充分明白：只有获得全人类的解放，世界真正的和平才有保障。这样，苏联妇女反法西斯委员会积极发起并参加了国际民主妇联的组织，积极支援殖民地半殖民地国家为求民族解放的斗争，积极支持资本主义国家妇女对帝国主义战争的斗争；和全世界爱好和平的妇女在一起，为反对帝国主义而斗争，为保护妇女和儿童的权利而斗争。同时，苏联妇女奋力参加苏联国内经济的和文化的建设，加强巩固社会主义的苏联，这也就是加强保卫世界和平的工作。
    苏联的姊妹们的先进的经验是值得我们努力学习的。苏联妇女们已经克服了因为历史的及社会的压迫所加于妇女们的工作和学习上的落后现象。特鲁茨斯卡娅同志的事迹是一个很好的例子。作为一个铁路职员的女儿，在工厂设立的学校里读书以后，就尝试做了当时妇女们还从来没有尝试做的工作——修理火车头，做火车司机的助手，那时她是一个十八岁的大胆的姑娘。她的举动受到苏联政府的重视和帮助，两个医生被指定守护着她，保护她的健康和检定妇女能否担任这一方面的工作。特鲁茨斯卡娅以她自己的成功证明了这一点，从此，苏联政府就开办了女司机训练班，培养妇女司机。特鲁茨斯卡娅在技术和业务上不断前进，一九三六年得到列宁勋章，那时她二十三岁。第二年，她便成为全苏联第一个火车女司机，她首先提倡成立妇女开车小组，由一个司机，一个助手，一个司炉三个组成，负责保持车辆的速率、清洁、行驶的安全和年限，成为乘务负责制的最初的雏型。在反法西斯战争中她在军车上工作、由于她英勇无畏地保证了前线的军需供应，获得了英勇劳动勋章和红旗勋章，一九四三年荣膺相当于陆军少将的铁路三级将军衔。现在她是莫斯科地下铁道管理局的副局长。
    苏联成千成万的优秀的妇女们都和特鲁茨斯卡娅一样，勇敢地为自己为全人类打开了通向一切工作岗位的大门，苏联政府和伟大的领袖斯大林慈爱地鼓励着帮助着她们。现在，苏联各种各样的工作部门都有妇女参加了，女矿工，女技师，女舰长，女飞行员，女科学家……三十五万妇女做着集体农庄的主席、小队长和工厂的厂长、小组长，代表团中的社会主义劳动英雄乌巴伊拉杜耶娃就是其中之一；苏联有一百万以上的女教师，杰出的如代表团团长巴菲诺娃，担任了国际教育工作者联合会的副主席；苏联有二十八万女工程师、教授和专家，代表团之一的巴查诺娃教授是其中的一个，她主持着独立的学术研究工作；苏联有一百另八位妇女当了政府的部长、署长，一如这次来的吐克曼共和国社会保险部部长阿培尼佩索娃。
    工作着还要不断的学习，不断的前进，这是我们敬爱的苏联姊妹们对于千千万万在工作着奋斗着的中国妇女们的亲密的嘱咐。代表团中的阿培尼佩索娃她是吐克曼共和国的部长，同时是高等学校第三年级的学生。她们这样的不断学习，不断前进，是我们中国妇女的最好的榜样。
    她们高高兴兴地说起苏联妇女不仅把自己的智慧、才能和劳动奉献给国家，而且，还十分愉快地担负起了妇女对于祖国的特殊的贡献——生能和教养下一代的孩子。同时，社会主义的国家苏联也设立了成千成万的托儿所和幼稚园，免费的七年制学校，设备优良的儿童文化宫和游戏场，十分周到地照顾着儿童的教育和福利，使得母亲们可以完全安心地从事工作。代表团团长很快乐地告诉记者她有一个青年团员的女儿和一个少先队员的儿子，社会保险部长有了三个孩子，巴查诺娃教授有了两个孩子，莫斯科地下铁道管理局的将军也有了一个女儿。在苏联，儿女们对于母亲们绝不再成为工作和生活的障碍，相反地，由于母亲们的自觉的责任和社会主义祖国对于母亲和儿童的百般的照顾，已经成为使苏联妇女的生活更加充实更加幸福的泉源了。
