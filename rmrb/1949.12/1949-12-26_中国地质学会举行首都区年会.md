　　Chinese Geological Society Holds Annual Meeting in the Capital Region
    [This newspaper dispatch] The 25th Annual Meeting of the Capital Region of the Chinese Geological Society grandly opened on the 24th in the auditorium of the College of Science at Peking University. In addition to all members and associates from the Beijing Geological Survey, the Department of Geology at Peking University, and the Department of Geosciences at Tsinghua University, there were also 164 attendees, including Vice President of the Academy of Sciences Zhu Kezhen, members or guests from various units of the Science Congress, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Railways, as well as Soviet friends.
    Sun Yunzhu, Chairman of the conference, pointed out in his speech that past annual meetings had focused on the presentation of papers, while this conference would adopt collective research and collective discussion to solve existing practical problems. He then introduced the development history of Chinese geology, pointing out that due to the oppression and neglect of past reactionary regimes, Chinese geological work had not been widely carried out. Only after liberation did it begin to move towards brightness.
    Wang Hongzhen, secretary of the Beijing branch of the association, presented the annual report. Soviet friends then took the floor to introduce the Soviet Union's geological research situation and put forward many practical suggestions for the Chinese geological community. The conference ended at 12 o'clock amidst enthusiastic applause.

　　中国地质学会举行首都区年会
    【本报讯】中国地质学会第二十五届首都区年会二十四日在北大理学院礼堂隆重揭幕。除北京地质调查所，北大地质系，清华地学系全体会员，会友外；并有科学院副院长竺可桢，科代会、文化部、铁道部各单位会员或来宾及苏联友人达一百六十四人。
    大会主席孙云铸讲话首先指出：过去历次年会都是偏重论文宣读，本届大会却采取了集体研究，集体讨论来解决存在的实际问题。接着介绍了中国地质学的发展历史，指出由于过去反动政权的压迫和漠视，中国地质工作未能广泛开展。解放后，才开始走向光明。
    该会北京分会书记王鸿桢，提出年会报告。苏联友人继起介绍了苏联地质研究情况，并对中国地质界提出了许多实践意见。大会于十二时热烈掌声中结束。
