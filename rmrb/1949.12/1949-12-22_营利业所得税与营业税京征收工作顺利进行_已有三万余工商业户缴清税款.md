[Beijing News] Since the unified collection of income tax and business tax on profit-making industries in Beijing began on December 6th, industrial and commercial households have enthusiastically paid their taxes. As of December 15th, a total of 30,939 industrial and commercial households in the city had fully paid their taxes, accounting for over 91% of the 33,687 industrial and commercial households in the city subject to taxation this time. The tax revenue deposited into the treasury has reached over 88.5% of the total amount. The results of this collection are very good, but some shortcomings have arisen in the collection methods. It was originally planned that the income tax and business tax on profit-making industries would be collected in two phases, from the 6th to the 12th and from the 16th to the 25th. However, in the specific implementation, due to insufficient explanation, most of those who paid did so in the first phase, while those who had not paid remained unpaid. After the Municipal Government discovered this, it convened meetings of the Income Tax and Business Tax Unified Collection Review Committee and the Municipal Promotion Committee on the 15th, and conducted a review at the Municipal Government administrative meeting on the 16th to study solutions. After several rounds of discussion and listening to the opinions of representatives of industrial and commercial households, it was decided that: (1) Regarding the provision for phased collection in the collection method, the government should review this shortcoming, as it did not emphasize that payment could be made in installments, and should pay attention to improvement in future specific implementation. (2) For the second phase rice price, in order to take care of taxpayers, it will still be calculated at 600 yuan in accordance with the actual situation, but industrial and commercial households who paid early in the first 90% should be commended and given appropriate consideration in the next collection. (3) It is estimated that the vast majority of the remaining 9% who have not paid will also be able to pay their taxes within the second phase deadline ending on the 25th of this month, so the entire tax payment period will not be extended. However, the government will give appropriate consideration to taxpayers with special difficulties after a thorough investigation.

　　营利业所得税与营业税京征收工作顺利进行
    已有三万余工商业户缴清税款
    【北京讯】京市营利事业所得税与营业税统一征收工作，自十二月六日开始收款以来，工商业户踊跃缴款，到十二月十五日止，全市工商业户已全部缴清税款的达三万零九百三十九户，占全市此次纳税工商业户三万三千六百八十七户的百分之九十一强。纳库税款已达总数百分之八十八点五强。这次征收成绩很好，但是在征收方法上发生了一些缺点。营利事业所得税与营业税原定分为六日到十二日与十六日到二十五日两期征收，但在具体执行中，由于解释的不够明确，已缴的大多数均在第一期缴清，而未缴的却始终未缴。经市政府发现后，已于十五日分别召开了两税统征复核委员会与市推进委员会会议，十六日又在市府行政会议上进行检讨，研究解决办法。经数度反复讨论，并听取了工商业户代表的意见后决定：（一）关于征收办法中分期征收的规定，由于政府未着重说明可以分期缴纳，此种缺点政府应该检讨，并在今后具体执行中注意改进。（二）第二期米价，为照顾纳税户，按照实际情况，仍以六百元计征，但对百分之九十早缴的工商业户应予以表扬，并在下次征收时适当加以照顾。（三）未缴的百分之九弱的户，估计在本月二十五日止第二期期限内，绝大部分也都可缴清税款，故整个缴税期限不再延长。但对有特殊困难税者，在调查确实后，政府当予以适当照顾。
