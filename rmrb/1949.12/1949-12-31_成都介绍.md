Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 30th:

	Chengdu is located in the center of the Sichuan Basin, bordering the Minjiang and Jinjiang Rivers. Surrounded by canals and fields, it is a fertile area with abundant products, making it the most prosperous region in the province. The city has a population of approximately 700,000. Transportation is convenient, with highways including the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway leading north through Jianmen Pass to Shaanxi and Xi'an; the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway going east to Chongqing; the Sichuan-Xikang Highway heading west to Kangding; and the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway going south through Huxian County directly to Kunming. Regarding railways, the roadbed of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is largely completed and will be open to traffic after the tracks are laid. The city is lined with shops, and brocade is the most famous specialty. Industries include match manufacturing, textiles, chemicals, leather, and machinery. The Chengdu Plain has fertile soil and tender grass, and the cattle hides and wool produced are of high quality. Chengdu serves as a distribution center and a major export hub. In addition, there are small hydropower plants outside the North Gate and Wucheng Gate utilizing water power. Higher education institutions include Sichuan University, West China University, and Chenghua University, among others, totaling over seven. Chengdu was the location of the largest U.S. imperialist air force base in China and is the second largest city in the southwestern provinces after Chongqing. After the liberation of Chongqing, the Kuomintang remnant government fled here in a panic, attempting to make a final stand, but under the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, they soon fled to Taipei. The liberation of Chengdu marks the final expulsion of the Kuomintang remnant bandits from mainland China.

专栏：标志国民党残余匪首最后被赶出中国大陆

    成都介绍
    成都地处四川盆地的中心，城濒岷江、锦江之滨，四围支渠、田畴交错，沃野千里，物产极为富饶，为全省第一富庶之区，全市人口约七十余万。交通便达，公路干线川陕公路北出剑门关入陕可至西安；成渝公路东去可达重庆；川康公路西行至康定；川滇公路南经沪县直达昆明。铁路方面的成渝路路基已经大部完工，只待铺轨后即可通行。市内商店栉比，特产以锦缎为最著名。工业有火柴业、纺织业、化学工业、皮革业、机器工业等。成都平原土肥草嫩，所产牛皮毛均佳，以成都为集散地，为出口大宗。此外成都北门和武成门外尚有利用水力的小型发电厂。专科以上学校有四川大学、华西大学、成华大学等七余所。成都为美帝国主义侵华最大空军基地的所在地，也是西南诸省仅次于重庆的第二座大城市。重庆解放后，国民党残余政府曾仓皇逃此企图进行最后顽抗，但在解放军的强大攻势下，随即逃往台北。成都的解放，标志着国民党残余匪首已最后被赶出中国大陆。
