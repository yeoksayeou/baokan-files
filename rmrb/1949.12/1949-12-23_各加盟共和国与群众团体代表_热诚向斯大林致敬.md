Representatives of the various Union Republics and mass organizations
Warmly pay tribute to Stalin

Academician Nesmeyanov spoke first, extending warm and heartfelt greetings from the great Russian people to Joseph Stalin. For every noble work he has done, for his parental care for humanity, for the happiness and joy of the new life, millions of working people from every corner of the Russian Republic – from the far north to the southern coast of Crimea, from the Baltic Sea to Sakhalin Island – extend their sincere gratitude to the great leader.

Next to speak was Stalin Prize laureate and renowned Moscow factory foreman Rosiisky. He extended warm congratulations and sincere respect to Stalin on behalf of the people of Moscow. Rosiisky spoke of the pride felt by the people of Moscow, who were fortunate to live and work in the same city as Stalin. Rosiisky reported the production achievements of the people of Moscow, and he assured Stalin that they would continue to work selflessly for the benefit of their great motherland, for the benefit of communism.

Stalin Prize laureate and People's Artist of the USSR, Cherkasov, congratulated Stalin on behalf of the working people of Leningrad. He said to Comrade Stalin: Many glorious pages of your life are inextricably linked with this great city, and the working people of Leningrad are proud of this.

Representatives of delegations of working people from the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Uzbek, Kazakh, Georgian, Azerbaijani, Moldavian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Armenian, Turkmen, Estonian, and Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republics, as well as representatives of the Soviet youth and Young Pioneers, then rose to speak.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, representative of the working people of the Romanian People's Republic, Kim Tu-bong, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, representative of the Mongolian People's Republic, successively delivered congratulatory speeches.

The audience welcomed with warm applause Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee, who brought greetings from the Italian working people to Stalin. Togliatti said: We pledge to abide by your teachings, to fight for the unity of the workers, for the independence of our country, for peace, and against the instigators of a new war. The Italian people will never agree to be drawn into a new war against the Soviet Union and against the people who have embarked on the road to socialism.

Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, delivered a passionate and colorful speech.

Joseph Stalin also received congratulations from the heads of delegations of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, France, Finland, and Austria. The last to speak was Marshal of the Soviet Union and Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Vasilevsky.

Shvernik announced: Congratulatory telegrams to Stalin continue to arrive from all over the Soviet Union, from workers, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals, expressing their most sincere love and boundless respect for the great leader of all nationalities.

Congratulatory telegrams to Stalin are pouring in from the most remote corners of the Earth. For the happiness of all progressive mankind, the working people of the world congratulate Stalin on his health and longevity. The celebration closed with the singing of the party anthem "The Internationale." After the meeting, a celebratory concert was held, featuring the best artists of the Soviet Union and the people's choirs and orchestras of Moscow and the various Union Republics.
