　　Patients' Voices
　　Qingdao Shandong University Student, Yin Ping

　　As a student with poor health, I have many opportunities to interact with doctors. I know I lack medical knowledge, not even a smattering, and I want to offer some suggestions to hospital doctors based on my experience as a patient. I believe these suggestions represent the views of most patients. Therefore, my lowest hope is to break down the long-standing barrier between doctors and patients that existed in the old society, so they can gradually understand each other. This way, on the one hand, the efficiency of doctors in treating diseases can be increased; on the other hand, the suffering of patients can be reduced, and they can recover their health as soon as possible.

　　Whenever the issue of doctors' attitudes towards patients is raised, it is often said: "This is a social problem. When the entire society changes and doctors establish a new outlook on life of serving the people, their attitudes will naturally change." I fully acknowledge the correctness of this statement, because it is the fundamental issue. Therefore, if this problem is not thoroughly resolved, it will inevitably affect the attitude of doctors in treating diseases, and the method of medical treatment – how to treat patients.

　　The doctors I am talking about here are not quack doctors selling wild medicines, nor are they commercialized doctors in capitalist society who only know how to make profits and disregard the suffering of patients, but those who treat diseases and save lives. I believe that the task of such doctors is: "To find ways to help patients recover their health as soon as possible under the principles of scientific diagnosis and treatment and economic feasibility."

　　What is illness? I believe that it is not only abnormal physiological phenomena that are called illness. In a broad sense, when abnormal psychological phenomena are closely linked to abnormal physiological phenomena and affect physical health, it is also called illness. When treating illness, one should not isolate and treat only local lesions, but should treat the entire "patient."

　　Currently, some doctors are intentionally or unintentionally ignoring the role of psychological factors in diseases, or even completely excluding psychological factors from the scope of diseases, regarding diseases as purely abnormal pathological phenomena, and treating patients as broken machines, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and implementing the hospital's departmental system too mechanically. Therefore, when treating diseases, doctors do not pay attention to the patient's overall condition, do not pay attention to the patient's psychological state, and even less understand the patient's social environment, do not ask the patient's medical history carefully and in detail, cannot listen to all the questions the patient raises about the disease, and do not tell the patient about disease prevention and matters that should be paid attention to in life. Conversely, some old-fashioned doctors often cast scornful glances at patients, make frivolous remarks, and give indifferent responses. Here, I don't need to cite examples. This situation is mainly due to errors in the medical treatment methods. Old, mechanical medical methods sometimes not only fail to cure the disease, but instead make the disease more serious.

　　Undeniably, in the past in the old society, we were indeed unable to make such demands. The environmental resistance of society did not allow us to achieve our ideal hopes. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the entire society has arranged a favorable environment for us, enabling all aspects to have favorable conditions for normal development. The medical community is also reconsidering its medical treatment methods. Because, the problem is: it is not only the outlook on life of a few doctors that needs to be rebuilt (this is fundamental); but also in terms of business and technology – this erroneous medical treatment method, this deeply ingrained bad habit, must also be reformed in order to truly serve the people. On the other hand, from a purely medical point of view, it is also imperative to re-examine medical treatment methods so that medicine can move forward and develop under new social conditions.

　　病人的呼声
    青岛山大石  荫坪
    我是一个学生，由于我身体不健康，所以与医生接触的机会特别多。我知道自己缺乏医学常识，甚至还谈不上一知半解，我愿以一个病人的体验向医院医生提出一点意义：我相信这意见是代表了大部分病人的意见。因此，我最低的希望是借这篇东西打破旧社会时医生与病人间长期的隔膜，使他们能相互日渐了解。这样，一方面可以增加医生治病的效率；一方面减少病人的痛苦，使他们早日恢复健康。
    每当提起医生对待病人的态度问题时，往往会说：“这是个社会问题，当整个社会变了，医生建立了新的为人民服务的人生观以后，态度自然会改变的。”我完全承认这句话的正确性，因为这原是根本问题。所以，这一问题如果没有澈底解决，就必然影响到医生医病的态度问题，医疗的方法问题——如何给病人治病。
    我在这里所谈的医生，不是江湖郎中卖野药的，也不是资本主义社会中只知谋利不顾病人痛苦的商业化医生，而是那些治病救人的医生。我以为这样医生的任务是：“想法使病人在科学的诊治和经济的原则下，早日恢复健康。”
    什么叫病？我以为不只是生理的反常现象叫做病，广义的说，当心理的反常现象与生理的反常现象密切的联系而发生影响到身体不健康的时候，也叫做病，治病的时候，不能孤立的只治局部的病变，而应当治整体的“病人”。
    目前，有某些医生是在有意无意中忽略了心理因素在疾病中应有的份量，甚至于根本就把心理因素抛出疾病范围之外，把疾病看成是单纯的不正常的病理现象，把病人当成一座坏的机器，头疼医头，脚疼医脚，把医院中的分科制度执行的太机械化了；因此，医生在治病时，不去注意病人的整体，不注意病人的心理状态，对于病人的社会环境更是不去了解，不认真不详细的询问病人的病历，不能倾听病人对于疾病发出的一切问题，不告诉病人对疾病的预防及生活中应该注意的事项。相反地，有些旧式的医生对病人时常投以渺视的眼光，发出轻佻的言笑，给以冷淡的应付。这里，我不必例举事实。这种情形，主要地是在医疗方法上犯了错误，旧的机械地医疗方法，有时不但医不好病，反面会使疾病更趋严重。
    不可否认的，过去在旧社会中，我们的确是不可能提出这样要求，社会的环境阻力，不允许我们达到理想的希望。今天在共产党和人民政府的领导下，整个的社会已给我们安排好一个有利的环境，使各方面有了走向正常发展的有利条件，医学界在医疗方法上也是从新考虑的时候了。因为，问题是：不只是少数医生的人生观需要重建（这是基本的）；而业务上技术上——这种错误的医疗方法，这种根深蒂固的不良习惯，也必需改革，才能真正为人民服务。另一方面，站在纯医学观点上，使医学能在新的社会条件之下，向前发展，重新检讨医疗方法也是刻不容缓的。
