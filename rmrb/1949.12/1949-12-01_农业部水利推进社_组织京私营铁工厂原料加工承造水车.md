　　Agricultural Ministry Water Conservancy Promotion Society
    Organizes Beijing Private Iron Factories to Process Raw Materials and Manufacture Waterwheels
    [Beijing News] The Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government (reorganized from the original Water Conservancy Promotion Headquarters of the Department of Agriculture of the North China People's Government) has improved the method of private iron factories in Beijing undertaking the manufacture of waterwheels, changing from ordering complete products to processing raw materials, which can complete the task on time and unify the quality of waterwheels. In order to improve agricultural production and turn dry land into paddy fields, the society has vigorously developed the waterwheel industry. It has organized more than 30 private iron factories in Beijing to build waterwheels. From May to November, a total of 5,000 units were manufactured. It is planned that from November to May of next year, private iron factories in Beijing will undertake the manufacture of another 10,000 to 20,000 units. The society has gone through a tortuous path in carrying out this work. At the beginning, the society ordered goods from various iron factories, paying 80% of the total cost of labor and materials in advance, and the factories purchased the raw materials themselves. After receiving the orders, the factories rushed to buy raw materials in the market, which often caused fluctuations in raw material prices; at the same time, the quality of the self-purchased raw materials was uneven, which affected the uniformity and improvement of waterwheel quality. When prices fluctuated slightly, the factories cut corners, reduced quality, or failed to deliver the goods on time, which affected the completion of the entire production plan of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society. The first batch of waterwheels ordered by the society in May was originally scheduled to be delivered in two months, but it was delayed for four or five months because of this. There were also individual factories, such as Xingji and Haiquan, who used past fraudulent methods to obtain order payments for other purposes, not buying raw materials to make waterwheels, thinking that once the money was in hand, they could do whatever they wanted. After the society granted three extensions, they still failed to deliver the goods, and it was finally resolved by sending them to the court. After half a year of exploration and research, the society changed its approach from late October, supplying major raw materials such as lead plates, round iron, and pig iron, while the factories provided labor, fuel, and a small portion of minor raw materials such as screws, rubber, and pig iron rings to jointly produce waterwheels. In this way, the factories' material costs can be free from the influence of price fluctuations, and a part of the manpower for purchasing raw materials can be saved, allowing them to concentrate on researching and improving technology to improve quality. At the same time, various raw materials are uniformly purchased by the Water Conservancy Promotion Society from production areas such as the Northeast and Taiyuan, which can also reduce fluctuations in the prices of metal raw materials in the city. Moreover, production tasks can be completed on time, and waterwheel products can meet certain specifications. For example, in November, the society ordered a total of 500 waterwheels, all of which were delivered on time. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in the past six months. The second improvement of the society is to establish cost accounting in conjunction with raw material processing. In the past, when ordering waterwheels, there was no precise cost. The raw materials, labor, and fuel required for each part of the waterwheel were not scientifically calculated, but were estimated by both parties, and prices were bargained. Later, in order to ensure that factories could make a certain profit and protect workers' lives, the society led various factories to establish a cost accounting system. This method has greatly stimulated the factories to develop their business. The factories have streamlined unnecessary business personnel and have tried to get business personnel to participate in simple labor as much as possible. Some factories have also actively expanded their production capacity, such as the newly built iron factory adding a vertical pig iron furnace, and the Chunji Iron Factory increasing workers and sand casting equipment.
    Guiding and Assisting Factories to Improve Production Technology
    In terms of improving production technology, the guidance and assistance of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society to various factories has also played a significant role. The society often sends people to factories to go deep into the working masses to conduct ideological mobilization, so that workers realize that workers and peasants should help each other, and to develop agricultural production, they must manufacture durable and efficient agricultural tools for farmers. The workers' technology has made many progress in the past six months. For example, the Dongshengxing factory used to use manual labor to make water pipes, each set being three zhang long, requiring three or four workers. Now, they have invented the use of a rolling machine, which can produce one and a half sets per worker, and the quality of the pipes is also better than that of hand-made ones. The society also guides the factories to strictly divide labor, dividing waterwheel manufacturing into several departments, such as sand casting, pipe making, chain making, rubber making, and assembly, with each factory taking special responsibility, giving full play to its strengths, and cooperating. In addition, production inspections are carried out on various factories, and if any discrepancies with the provisions in the contract are found, they are immediately pointed out and corrected. With such close cooperation between public and private sectors, the quality and efficiency of waterwheels have been improved.
    Encouraging private capital and state capital to cooperate in production that is beneficial to the country under necessary and possible conditions, the Water Conservancy Promotion Society has made some achievements in this regard. However, there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently: First, the Water Conservancy Promotion Society has failed to fully supply raw materials. Because a small part of the raw materials is still provided by the factories themselves, the quality cannot be absolutely uniform, especially the parts are inconsistent in various factories, and it is difficult to assemble them if they are damaged. Second, the society lacks sufficient technical personnel to conduct more thorough inspections of the production of various factories and guide the factories to improve their technology at any time. In particular, the society's warehouse lacks acceptance personnel, resulting in more than 1,000 waterwheels being accumulated for several months without formal acceptance. Third, in terms of the profit margin for factories to undertake waterwheel production, it has not been well coordinated with other state economic agencies. For example, the profit of the Ministry of Railways ordering transportation equipment from various factories exceeds that of making waterwheels, and the factories tend to undertake work with high profits, which affects the promotion of the waterwheel production plan.

　　农业部水利推进社
    组织京私营铁工厂原料加工承造水车
    【北京讯】中央人民政府农业部水利推进社（由原华北人民政府农业部水利推进总社改组而成），改进各私营铁工厂承做水车的办法，由订货包活改为原料加工，能按期完成任务，并水车使质量统一。该社为提高农业生产，变旱田为水田，大力发展水车事业，曾组织北京三十余家私营铁工厂建造水车，从五月到十一月共造了五千台，计划从十一月到明年五月以前，再由北京市各私营铁工厂承造一万台到两万台。该社进行这一工作曾走过一段弯路。开始时，该社向各铁工厂订货，预付全部工料费八成，原料由厂方自购。各厂接得订款后，纷纷在市场争购原料，常引起原料价格波动；同时自购的原料品质不齐，影响水车质量的划一和提高。物价稍有波动，各工厂偷工减料、降低质量或不能如期交货，以致影响水利推进社整个生产计划的完成，该社五月间预订的第一批水车，原定两个月交齐，即因此拖延了四、五个月。还有个别工厂如邢记、海泉等，以过去的欺骗办法领得订款后另作别用，不买原料做水车，认为钱已到手就可为所欲为，经该社予以三次展期，仍未交齐，最后送到法院才得解决。该社经半年来的摸索与研究，自十月下旬起，乃改由该社供给铅板、元铁、生铁等主要原料，工厂出人工、燃料和镙丝、胶皮、生铁环等一小部分次要原料，合作生产水车。这样工厂用料可以不受物价波动的影响，并省去一部分采购原料的人力，可专心研究改进技术提高品质。同时各项原料由水利推进社到东北、太原等产地统一采购，还可减少本市五金原料价格的波动。而且能如期完成生产任务，并使水车产品能达一定规格。如十一月份该社共订造五百台水车，都能全部如期交货。这是半年来未有的现象。该社的第二个改进是结合原料加工，建立成本计算。过去订造水车，无精确成本，未把水车各部分所需原料、人工、燃料作科学统计，而是由双方估计，要价还价，该社后为使工厂有一定利润可图和保障工人生活，领导各厂建立了成本计算制度。这一办法对工厂发展业务有极大刺激作用，各工厂精简了不必要的业务人员，并尽可能使业务人员也参加简单劳动。还有些工厂积极扩大生产力，如新建铁工厂增设立式熔铁炉，纯记铁工厂增加工人和翻砂设备。
    指导协助各厂改进生产技术
    在改进生产技术方面，水利推进社对各工厂的指导协助，也起了很大作用。该社经常派人下厂深入工人群众做思想动员，使工人认识到工农应该互助，发展农业生产，就要给农民制造坚固耐用效能高的农具。工人们的技术半年来已有许多进步，如东顺兴等厂原用人工打水管，每套三丈长，需三、四个工，现发明用卷筒机，每工能打一套半，而管子品质比手工打的也有改进。该社并指导各厂严密分工，把造水车分成翻砂、打管子、做链子、做胶皮、成装等数部门，每厂各负专责，发挥所长，分工合作。此外，并对各工厂进行生产检查，发现与合同中规定不合的，立即指出改正。在这样公私密切合作下，水车的品质、效能都提高了。
    在必要和可能的条件下，鼓励私人资本和国家资本合作，进行对国家有利的生产，水利推进社在这方面已有一些成绩。但目前还存在一些问题亟待解决：一、水利推进社未能全面供给原料，由于还有一小部原料由工厂自备，使品质还不能绝对划一，特别是零件部分各厂不一致，如有损坏即难装配。二、该社缺乏足够技术人材，不能对各厂生产作更周密的检查，随时指导各厂改进技术。尤其是该社仓库缺少验收人员，以致数月来积存一千余台水车，尚未正式验收。三、在让各厂承作水车的利润上，没有和其他国家经济机关配合好，如铁道部向各厂订做交通器材的利润超过做水车，各厂趋向承作利润高的工作，影响水车生产计划的推进。
