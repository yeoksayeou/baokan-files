The Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government invited professors from the Department of Science of the Teachers College to hold a symposium at Leyutang Hall of the Teachers College on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss how to promote the popularization of scientific knowledge. Those present at the symposium included Yuan Hanqing, Director of the Science Popularization Bureau, and more than 30 professors from the Department of Science of the Teachers College, including Fu Zhongsun, Huang Guozhang, Qi Kaizhi, and Wang Dianji. Director Yuan Hanqing first reported on the tasks of the establishment of the Science Popularization Bureau, and pointed out that science popularization serves workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it is to improve the cultural level of the broad masses of people. Professor Qi Kaizhi also pointed out that science popularization is a tool for ideological struggle. He said: Because science and superstition are contradictory, to promote science, we must fight against superstition. In order to effectively popularize science education, they discussed the following two main issues: (1) The issue of viewpoints on natural science teaching. They believe that they should try their best to assist and contact primary and secondary school teachers and social education workers, clearly establish the viewpoint of popularizing science education, and use relevant equipment to carry out popular science education. (2) Normal universities and colleges above the specialist level should maintain close contact with the Science Popularization Bureau in the future in order to carry out organized science popularization work and prepare to compile science manuals, reading materials, and electronic teaching scripts.

    【北京讯】中央人民政府文化部科学普及局于二十二日下午邀师大理教学院教授，在师大乐育堂举行座谈会，讨论如何推进科学知识普及问题。出席座谈会者有科学局袁翰青局长、师大理教学院教授傅种荪、黄国璋、祁开智、王奠基等三十余人。袁翰青局长首先报告了科学普及局成立的任务，并指出科学普及是为工农兵服务的，是提高广大人民的文化水平的。祁开智教授也提出了科学普及是思想斗争的工具，他说：因为科学和迷信是矛盾的，要提倡科学，就得与迷信作斗争。为了有效地普及科学教育，他们讨论了下面主要两个问题：（一）自然科学教学的观点问题，他们认为应尽量辅导及联系中小学教师及社教机关工作人员，明确树立普及科学教育的观点，并利用有关设备进行普及科学教育。（二）师范大学及专科以上学校今后应与科学普及局密切联系，以便进行有组织的科学普及工作，并准备编辑科学手册、读物、电教稿本等。
