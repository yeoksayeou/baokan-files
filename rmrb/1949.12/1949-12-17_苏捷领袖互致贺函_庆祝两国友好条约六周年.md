Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: TASS Moscow News: December 12th marked the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. The President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Gottwald, and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Shvernik, and the Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, Zápotocký, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Marshal Stalin, exchanged congratulatory letters. Marshal Stalin's congratulatory letter is as follows:

Mr. Zápotocký, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Czechoslovak Republic:

On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Republic, I request you, Mr. Prime Minister, to accept my friendly congratulations to the people of all nationalities of the Czechoslovak Republic, to their government, and to you personally. I wish the Czechoslovak Republic prosperity, and the further consolidation of the alliance and friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

Joseph Stalin (Signed)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: According to TASS: The Pravda published an editorial on the 20th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. The editorial stated: Czechoslovakia was liberated by the Soviet army from the shackles of the Hitlerite bandits, and also saved from the new danger of possibly becoming a colony of American and British imperialism. The Soviet Union and other People's Democracies have been providing selfless assistance to Czechoslovakia after the war, and the ties between them are developing and strengthening.

Last year, trade between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union increased by almost 45 percent compared to the previous year. The Soviet Union not only supplies Czechoslovakia with raw materials and food, but also with very important basic construction equipment, and provides ever-increasing technical assistance. The achievements of Czechoslovakia's planned economy are brilliant. The industrial output in October has exceeded the pre-war level by 17 percent. The rationing system for bread, flour, candy, and potatoes has been abolished. The prices of many consumer goods have been reduced, and the real wages of workers and staff have also greatly increased.

The editorial pointed out: Nine million Czechoslovak citizens signed letters congratulating Comrade Stalin on his 70th birthday, expressing their infinite love, loyalty, and infinite gratitude to the leader and mentor who liberated them and gave them a happy present and a happier future.

Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Clementis also published an article in the Soviet Izvestia on the 11th, pointing out: The Czechoslovak people are well aware that without cooperation with the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak people would undoubtedly become victims of the conspiracy and pressure of the capitalist world. This is an important factor in increasing the Czechoslovak people's loyalty, sympathy, and love for the Soviet Union. The Czechoslovak people not only regard this alliance as a guarantee of their security, but also as a guarantee of their construction of a socialist future.

　　苏捷领袖互致贺函
    庆祝两国友好条约六周年
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日为苏联和捷克斯洛伐克签订友好互助与合作条约六周年纪念日，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统哥特瓦尔德和苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理萨波托斯基和苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅互致贺函。斯大林元帅的贺函如下：捷克斯洛伐克共和国部长会议主席萨波托斯基先生：
    值此苏联和捷克斯洛伐克共和国签订友好与互助条约六周年纪念之际，我请求你总理先生，接受我向捷克斯洛伐克共和国各族人民、向他们的政府和向你本人的友好的祝贺。谨祝捷克斯洛伐克共和国繁荣，和苏联与捷克斯洛伐克两国人民的同盟与友谊进一步巩固。
     约瑟夫·斯大林（签字）
    【新华社北京十五日电】据塔斯社讯：真理报二十日发表社论庆祝苏捷签订友好互助与合作条约的六周年。社论称：捷克斯洛伐克被苏联军从希特勒匪帮的桎梏下解放出来，同时也从可能变为美英帝国主义殖民地的新危难中被解救出来了。苏联及各人民民主国家战后给捷克无私的援助，彼此之间的联系正在发展加强。
    去年的捷苏贸易几乎比前年增加了百分之四十五。苏联对捷克不但供给原料和粮食，还供给非常重要的基本建设设备，并给予有增无已的技术援助。捷克斯洛伐克计划经济的成就是辉煌的，十月份的工业产量已超过战前水平的百分之十七。面包、面粉、糖果和马铃薯的配给制已经废除。许多消费品的价格已经减低，而工人与职员的实际工资也已大大增加了。
    社论指出：九百万捷克斯洛伐克公民在祝贺斯大林同志七十大寿的函件上签了名，表示出他们对使他们获得解放，使他们有着幸福的现在和更幸福的将来的领袖与导师之无限爱戴、忠诚和无限感激。
    捷外长克利门蒂斯十一日在苏联消息报亦发表专文指出：捷克斯洛伐克人民深知，如果没有与苏联的合作，捷克斯洛伐克人民无疑地就会沦为资本主义世界之阴谋与压力的牺牲品。这是增加捷克斯洛伐克人民对苏联之忠诚、同情与敬爱的重要的因素。捷克斯洛伐克人民不仅把这个同盟看成是他们安全的保证，而且也是他们建设社会主义前途的保证。
