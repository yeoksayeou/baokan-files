Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 9th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation Of Democratic Youth, the All-China Student Federation, the Central Youth League School, and the China Youth Art Theater held a meeting on the 9th to commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st," with over 900 people attending. Yang Shu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Youth League Central Committee, gave the opening speech. He pointed out that in commemorating "December 9th" and "December 1st" today, we must remember the path of intellectuals integrating with workers and peasants as indicated by the "December 9th" Movement. At the same time, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and improve our political thought and theoretical level to better serve the people. Subsequently, Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Youth League Central Committee, reported, pointing out that the "December 9th" Movement fourteen years ago set off a nationwide upsurge of the national salvation movement, politically severely hitting the Kuomintang reactionaries' surrender and traitorous behavior, and becoming the prelude to the War of Resistance Against Japan. The "December 9th" patriotic movement was launched under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and achieved brilliant achievements under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He emphasized that only by consistently advancing under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can Chinese intellectuals have a bright future. This is one of the important historical experiences of the "December 9th" Movement.

Also: Teachers and students of major middle schools and universities in the capital also held memorial meetings, lectures, and other meaningful commemorative activities today. Beijing Municipal First, Second, Third, and Fourth Boys' Middle Schools and Municipal First Girls' Middle School, the Middle School Affiliated to the Normal University, Beijing Normal School, Private Xinsheng Middle School, Hebei Provincial High School, Beijing Municipal Senior Commercial School, and other schools held grand memorial meetings. At the meetings, the vast number of young students expressed their determination to intensify their study of revolutionary knowledge, further integrate with workers and peasants, and prepare to dedicate themselves to the construction of the new China.

　　青年团中央等单位
  　集会纪念“一二九”
    【新华社北京九日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、中央团校和中国青年艺术剧院于九日集会纪念“一二、九”与“一二、一”，到会九百多人。青年团中央宣传部部长杨述致开会词，他指出今天来纪念“一二、九”和“一二、一”，要记取“一二、九”运动所指示出的知识分子与工农兵结合的道路，同时更要加强学习马列主义，提高自己的政治思想和理论水平，以便更好地为人民服务。继由青年团中央副书记蒋南翔报告，他指出十四年前的“一二、九”运动，掀起了全国救亡运动的怒潮，在政治上重重地打击了国民党反动派的投降卖国行为，成为抗日战争的序幕。“一二、九”爱国运动是在中国共产党的坚强领导之下发动起来，并在中国共产党的正确领导之下获得了光辉的成就的。他着重指出，中国的知识分子唯有始终不渝地在中国共产党的领导之下前进，才有光明的前途。这是“一二、九”运动重要的历史经验之一。
    又：首都各大中学的师生今天亦纷纷举行了纪念会、讲演会以及其他有意义的纪念活动。北京市立第一、第二、第三、第四男子中学和市立第一女子中学、师范大学附属中学、北京师范、私立新生中学、河北省立高中、北京市立高级商业学校等学校举行盛大纪念会，会上广大的青年学生都表示要加紧学习革命知识，进一步与工农结合，准备献身于新中国的建设事业。
