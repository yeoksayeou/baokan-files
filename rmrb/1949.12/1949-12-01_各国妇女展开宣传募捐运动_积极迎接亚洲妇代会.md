Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th -- According to comprehensive reports, women from various countries around the world are actively carrying out various tasks to welcome the Asian Women's Representative Conference, which will be held in Beijing.

    Asia and Africa
    The Vietnam Women's Union has specially organized a national committee to publicize the significance of the Asian Women's Representative Conference. A special issue was published in the Women's Newspaper, and many symposiums were held.
    Women in Japan, Indonesia, Malaya, the Philippines, Burma, Ceylon, Thailand and other places are working hard to break through all the obstacles of reactionary forces at home and abroad to respond to and support the convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference.
    In the Middle East, women in Syria and Lebanon held many symposiums to publicize the significance of the Asian Women's Congress, and organized carnivals to raise funds for the Asian Women's Congress. They also sold postcards with famous painter Picasso's work: "Mother and Child".
    Women in Israel are also active supporters of the Asian Women's Congress.
    African women who will attend the Asian Women's Congress as guests, such as those from Algeria, Tunisia, French West Africa and Equatorial Africa, Nigeria, Madagascar, and Egypt, have launched extensive publicity and fundraising campaigns for this purpose.
    Eastern Europe
    Women in Eastern European countries also expressed their greatest sympathy for the convening of the Asian Women's Congress. Women in Hungary and Romania have printed pamphlets about the lives and struggles of Asian women, and have donated money to the International Democratic Women's Federation to help with the expenses of various delegations.
    Czech women started publicizing the news of the Asian Women's Congress months ago. Radio stations broadcast the lives and struggles of Asian women every week. They published a booklet entitled "Women of Asia and Africa", and widely organized symposiums to discuss Asian women's issues in Prague and various factories. Before the film started, someone gave a speech on the significance of the Asian Women's Congress for defending world peace.
    Polish women said in a letter to the International Democratic Women's Federation: "We fully understand the importance of the Asian Women's Representative Conference, because at this conference, women from oppressed countries can connect all their activities for freedom and peace."
    Western Europe
    Democratic women in imperialist countries support the liberation movement of colonial women and the convening of the Asian Women's Congress by opposing the domestic government's colonial policies. For example, Dutch women are doing their best to oppose the government's war of massacre against the Indonesian people, and they will provide financial support to the Indonesian delegation to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference.
    Women in Italy, Belgium, and Austria will also provide financial assistance to Indonesian women.
    In the UK, women have launched a widespread signature campaign and are preparing to send representatives to the conference. At the Peace Congress held in London on October 22, they discussed the Asian Women's Congress and colonial wars in various ways.
    The French Women's Union, at the meeting held in Marseille in June of this year, decided to strengthen the "Stop the War in Vietnam" campaign and urge the French government to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They will send representatives to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference, and have decided to bear the travel expenses for women representatives from Vietnam and Madagascar to come to Beijing. In addition, progressive newspapers and magazines in France are actively publicizing the Asian Women's Congress.
    Americas
    In the Americas, the Argentine Women's Union is fighting against the Peron fascist government. They have also published pamphlets on the lives and struggles of Asian women, and decided to donate the proceeds from the book "Peace Backbone" to the Asian Women's Congress.
    Democratic women in the United States are actively opposing the government's imperialist domination plan and the racial discrimination policies implemented by reactionaries against blacks. They will also send representatives to attend the Asian Women's Congress in order to link domestic democratic struggles with the world's peace struggles.
