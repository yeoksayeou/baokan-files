　　Hankou Establishes Short-Term Indexed Savings, Launches 20,000 Depositor Campaign
    Nanjing Improves Indexed Savings Procedures
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Hankou branch of the People's Bank of China, in order to further serve the community, protect the livelihoods of wage earners, absorb more idle social capital, and cooperate with the government's measures to stabilize prices, has decided to launch a campaign to solicit 20,000 basic depositors in Wuhan from December 12th to the end of March next year. At the same time, it will improve the indexed savings regulations and establish short-term salary savings. According to the actual situation and adopting opinions from all parties, the bank has cancelled the current indexed savings method and appropriately shortened the term of fixed indexed savings to facilitate deposits for general wage earners. The content and calculation method of the standard unit of real goods will also be practically unified with the wage real goods scores announced daily by the Provisional People's Government of Central China Wages Committee.
    [Another dispatch] The Nanjing branch of the People's Bank of China, in order to simplify the procedures for indexed savings deposits, has formulated the following three improvement measures: (1) Collective savings to open a master account: Each institution will be a unit and open a master account with the bank. When opening an account, an official letter can be used instead of an application form, as long as a list of depositors in the institution is provided, specifying the type of storage and the storage unit per person. As for the internal affairs of each institution, they will still keep separate accounts. (2) Collective savings to open accounts by group: If each institution considers its own scope to be too large and the number of employees to be too large to open one account conveniently, it can be divided into groups, and accounts can be opened by group. An official letter is also used instead of an application form, and a list of grouped storage is attached. Other methods are the same as in the first item. (3) Collective savings to open individual accounts: If each institution is too busy with work or does not have enough staff to adopt the aforementioned two methods, the accounting department can register each employee's storage scores before the salary is paid, prepare a list, and each person stamps to prove it. When paying and receiving wages, the amount to be saved will be deducted in advance, a check will be issued, and someone will be sent to the bank with an official letter replacing the application form, along with the storage list, to the handling clerk to individually issue a deposit certificate. If there are too many depositors and the deposit certificate cannot be issued all at once, the bank can first issue a temporary receipt and make an appointment to exchange it for a deposit certificate at a later date.

　　汉市创办短期折实储蓄开展两万存户运动
    南京改进折实储蓄手续
    【本报讯】中国人民银行汉口分行为进一步服务社会，保障工薪收入者的生活及更多吸收社会游资、配合政府平稳物价措施起见，订于十二月十二日起至明年三月底止，在武汉市开展征求两万个基本存户运动，又于同时改善折实储蓄章程及创办工薪短期存款。该行根据实际情况并采纳各方面意见，将活期折实储蓄办法取消，将定期折实储蓄期限酌予缩短，以便利一般工薪收入者存款。并将标准实物单位的实物内容及计算方法与中原临时人民政府工资委员会逐日公布的工薪实物分数从实际上统一起来。
    【又讯】中国人民银行南京市分行，为简化折实储蓄存款手续，特订出如下三种改进办法：（一）集体存储开立总户：以每一机构作一单位，向银行开立一总户。开户时，可用公函代替申请书，只要造具该机构存款人名册一份，载明存储种类及每人存储单位。至于各机构内部，仍各自分户记帐。（二）集体存储分组开户：各机构如认为自己的范围过大，职工的人数过多，开一个户头，有不方便时，可分成各个小组，分组开户，亦用公函代替申请书，并附分组存储名册，其他办法同第一项。（三）集体存储个别开户：各机构如因工作太忙，或办事人员不够，不能采用前述两种办法，可在发薪之先，由会计部门登记，每职工存储分数，造具清册，由各人盖章证明。发薪领款时，预将应储款额扣下，开支票，派人携带代替申请书的公函，连同存储名册去该行交经办员个别开给存证，如存储人数过多，存证一时不能开齐，可由该行先给一临时收据，约期再去换取存证。
