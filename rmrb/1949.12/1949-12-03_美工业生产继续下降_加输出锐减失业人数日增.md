Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st: U.S. production continues to decline. TASS, New York, November 19th: According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. industrial production in October decreased by 4.6 percent compared to September. The Board's production index for October was 166, compared to 174 in September and 195 in October of last year. This indicates that production in October of this year was about 15 percent lower than in the same period in 1948. Furthermore, figures from the Federal Reserve Board show that production of so-called durable goods (i.e., electric refrigerators, automobiles, radios, etc.) in October declined by 12 percent. Retail sales are still declining compared to last year, reflecting the decline in the purchasing power of the American people. The Federal Reserve Board reported that for the week ending November 19, department store sales across the country decreased by 8 percent compared to the same week last year. Since the beginning of this year, department store sales have decreased by a total of 6 percent compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st: Combined dispatches from telecommunications agencies: Canada's economic situation is deteriorating. According to a report released by the Canadian Bureau of Statistics, total exports in September were 228.4 million yuan, a decrease of 9 percent compared to August, and a decrease of 19 percent compared to the 283 million yuan in September 1948. This decline mainly comes from the U.S. market, which the government believes is the source of the problem. Because despite cosmetic "controls," U.S. exports to Canada are still growing at an "alarming rate," while Canadian exports to the U.S. are constantly declining. Canadian exports to the U.S. in September decreased by 48.3 million yuan compared to the same period last year.

At the same time, Canada's trade surplus with other countries has decreased by 168 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this year. According to the recent "austerity decree" issued by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, Canadian exports to Britain and other "British Commonwealth" countries will be further reduced this year. The number of unemployed is also increasing daily. The number of Canadian unemployed workers receiving unemployment insurance benefits this year has more than doubled compared to last year.

　　美工业生产继续下降
    加输出锐减失业人数日增
    【新华社北京一日电】美国生产继续下降。塔斯社纽约十一月十九日讯：据苏帮准备局估计，十月份的美国工业生产比九月份减少百分之四点六。该局所编制的十月份生产指数为一六六，九月份为一七四，去年十月份为一九五。这说明了本年十月份的生产比一九四八年同期的生产减少了几个百分之十五。又据联邦准备局的数字显示，十月份所谓耐久物品（即电器冰箱、汽车、收音机等）的生产，下降了百分之十二。零售业仍比去年衰退，这反映了美国平民购买力的低落。联邦准备局报告，至十一月十九日为止的一周，全国各地的百货公司销售量比去年同周减少百分之八。自今年初年以来，百货公司的销售量比去年同期共减少百分之六。
    【新华社北京一日电】综合电通社消息：加拿大的经济形势益趋恶化。据加拿大政府统计局所发表的报告，九月份的出口总量为二亿二千八百四十万元，较八月份减少百分之九，较一九四八年九月份的二亿八千三百万元减少百分之十九。这种衰退主要来自政府认为是解决问题所在的美国市场。因为尽管有装饰门面的“管制”，美国对加拿大的输出仍在以“惊人速率”增长着，而加拿大对美国的输出则在不断下降。加拿大九月份对美国的输出较去年同期减少了四千八百三十万元。
    同时，加拿大与其它各国贸易的出超，在今年头九个月中已减少了一亿六千八百万美元。根据英国财相克利浦斯最近颁布的“节约令”，加拿大对英国及其它“大英联邦”国家的输出，今年还将进一步减少。失业人数也日益增长。本年度加拿大失业工人领取失业保险金的比去年已超过一倍。
