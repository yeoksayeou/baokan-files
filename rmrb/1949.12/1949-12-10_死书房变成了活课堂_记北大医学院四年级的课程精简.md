　　Dead Study Becomes a Living Classroom
    ——On the Streamlining of the Fourth-Year Curriculum at Peking University Medical College

  　(1) The Problem is Acutely Raised

    The electric lights shone brightly late at night. The committee members of the Peking University Medical College branch of the Chinese Communist Party, suffering from lack of sleep, sat around the table, reporting and discussing the excessive curriculum and the abnormal learning progress at the medical college. Some extreme examples were: one student, in order to memorize the names and positions of the bones in anatomy, didn't even go to the dining hall for meals, but stayed in the anatomy lab, holding bones and gnawing on cornbread; another student hadn't taken off their clothes to sleep for half a year, only lying down for a while when extremely tired. Medical students spent an average of more than eight hours a week studying, resulting in dozing off in class, inability to concentrate on lectures, no rest after class, and tired minds busy catching up on accumulated exercises and reports. Learning efficiency was decreasing, and more seriously, the students' health was deteriorating. Comrades discussed these situations anxiously, unable to find appropriate solutions, and the report was sent to the Peking University General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Similar reports came from the Peking University Institute of Technology branch. At a meeting where students hosted school administrators, student representatives explained that the excessive curriculum and abnormal learning progress were common problems among students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine at Peking University. They analyzed that there were many reasons for this situation. The curricula of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine were mostly copied directly from universities in capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan. The divisions were already numerous and did not suit China's national conditions. The Kuomintang Ministry of Education intentionally increased the university curriculum in an attempt to hinder students' patriotic activities. Professors rarely coordinated with each other when teaching, and many places were tedious and repetitive, which also increased the burden on students. On the other hand, students' unrealistic and narrow-minded reading methods were also one of the reasons for the current situation. The problem was not resolved at the meeting and was brought to the former North China People's Government Higher Education Commission.

    The Higher Education Commission received reports of similar situations from several universities. After research and discussion, it instructed the universities to appropriately streamline the curriculum according to their specific circumstances.

    (2) Brewing, Mobilizing, and Streamlining

    The Party members, Youth League members, and students of Class 74 (fourth year of the seven-year program) of Peking University Medical College discussed the instructions of the Higher Education Commission and the school committee on streamlining the curriculum. The problem was clarified: streamlining was not "simplifying due to poor conditions," but "improving teaching and increasing learning efficiency." It was also recognized that to do this work well, the cooperation of professors must be obtained. Therefore, the class of thirty-odd people was divided into four groups. Three groups were assigned to solicit opinions from professors and teaching assistants who taught the three main courses—pathology, pharmacology, and parasitology—and strive for cooperation. One group was responsible for liaison with the college affairs meeting and other classes. The professors initially had ideological concerns. They believed that streamlining the curriculum was a kind of compression, and therefore the graduates would only be general "doctors who treat illnesses," rather than "research doctors" with research capabilities. The students used examples to explain that streamlining the curriculum was purification rather than compression. Students in higher grades who were already in clinical practice also proved that there were many wasted areas in the basic courses learned in the third and fourth years. They believed that learning extensively was not equal to being erudite. Only by learning the basic courses deeply and meticulously could one engage in erudite learning and advanced research. The professors agreed with this view. At a faculty-student symposium of the whole class, specific streamlining plans were proposed and discussed with the students. As a result, pharmacology experiments were reduced from two to one. Many experiments that were previously done separately are now carried out simultaneously by each group, with each group reporting after completion, and finally summarized by the professor. At the same time, before doing the experiment, the professor proposed the key points of the experiment and the necessary reference books to avoid students wasting time by delving into details and flipping through reference books randomly. Because the pharmacology course used to be so heavy that students could not pay good attention to other courses, the pathology professor often used exams to draw students' attention, and the students had to spend a lot of time memorizing lectures without actually understanding them. Now that the students have time to preview and review pathology lessons, the professor has also canceled the exams that lost their function of checking learning, and concentrated more energy and more time on explaining pathology lectures, students absorb them at any time, the total study time is reduced and the learning efficiency is improved a lot.

    (3) Mutual Learning to Consolidate Results

    Now, the students of Class 74 spend no more than sixty hours a week studying. The study plan for the whole class has also been drawn up. The time for classes, experiments, reports, self-study, discussions, review, and preview is well arranged for six days a week. The phenomenon that mutual learning groups were reduced to formalities due to the pressure of heavy homework and the inability of individuals to take care of themselves has also been overcome. With ample study time and a constantly full and healthy learning mood, learning groups systematically master learning. The group leader reflects students' opinions on teaching to the professor at any time, so that the professor can understand the situation. The progress of the explanation is both appropriate and can be accepted by the students at any time, and can also be targeted to solve the key to students' difficulties. The mutual aid group reviewed and overcame the situation of unrelated study and life in the past. Everyone took the initiative to question and analyze difficulties, and help others. The convenient conditions of living and eating together made their mutual aid progress faster. The learning results are significant. The average score of the class in the exam broke the record of previous sessions. The average score of the group was as high as 95 points. No one in the class failed any course.

    (4) The Dead Study Becomes Active

    The atmosphere in the classroom has changed. In the past, after the class bell rang, the students sat in the classroom unable to hold up their eyelids. The more they tried to listen, the easier it was to fall asleep. Opening their eyes and looking at the blackboard, they didn't know where the professor was talking. Rubbing their red and swollen eyelids, they looked at the professor very apologetically. The professors also understood that this was not the students' fault. Teachers and students only smiled bitterly at each other. After class, some people were still sleeping, and some people were busy preparing for the next lesson. The classroom was lifeless.

    Now, students sit upright in class, concentrating on grasping every word and every character of the professor. With plenty of time to prepare, the professors are also more energetic in lecturing. After class, teachers and students smile easily at each other, as if they have won a battle. When the sound of the professor's leather shoes disappeared from the classroom door, the classroom was suddenly filled with singing and laughter. Not even a trace of the lifelessness of a few months ago can be seen here. The dead study has become a living classroom.

　　死书房变成了活课堂
    ——记北大医学院四年级的课程精简
    金凤
  　（一）问题尖锐地被提出了
    深夜的电灯强烈地发射着光芒，睡眠不足的中共北大医学院分支的委员们围坐在桌子边，汇报着和讨论着医学院课程过重、学习进行不正常的现象。一些极端的例子是这样：一位同学因为要背熟解剖的骨头的名称和方位，连吃饭也不上饭堂，只呆在解剖室里一面捧着骨头一面啃窝窝头；另一位同学则已经有半年不脱衣服睡觉，只在疲倦极了的时候才和衣躺一会。医学院学生平均每星期学习的总时间超过八小时，造成的后果是上课打瞌睡，听讲不能专心，下课没有休息，疲乏了的头脑又忙着赶积欠下来的习题和报告，学习效率在降低着，更严重的是学生的健康情况变坏起来。同志们焦急地讨论着这些情况，不能获得适当的解决，汇报发向了中共北大总支部。
    同样的汇报来自北大工学院支部。在一次学生们招待学校行政当局的会议上，学生代表说明课程过重，同学学习进行不正常已经是北大理工农医等科学生中普遍存在的问题了。他分析着造成这等情况的原因很多，理工农医的课程多半直接从英美德日等资本主义国家的大学中抄袭过来，分科本就繁多，不合中国国情；国民党教育部又有意加重大学课程，企图以此阻碍学生的爱国活动；教授们教课彼此很少联系配合，许多地方繁琐重复，也加重了学生的负担；另一方面，学生们好高骛远，钻牛角尖的读书方法，也是造成目前情况的原因之一。问题在会上没有得到解决，提到了前华北人民政府高教会。
    高教会接到的是几个大学同样情况的报告，经过研究商讨，指示各大学按具体情况适当精简课程。
    （二）酝酿，动员，进行精简
    北大医学院七四班（七年制的四年级）的党团员们和同学们一起讨论着高教会和校委会关于精简课程的指令，问题弄清楚了：精简不是“因陋就简”，而是“改善教学，提高学习效率”。又认识到要做好这项工作，必须取得教授的合作。于是班上三十几个人分成四组，三组被分派向讲授三门主要课程——病理、药理和寄生虫——的教授讲助教们征求意见，争取合作，一组负责和院务会议、其他各班连系。教授们在最初也是有思想雇虑的，他们认为精简课程是一种压缩，因此培养出来的将只是普遍的“看病大夫”，而不是具有研究能力的“研究大夫”。同学们用实例说明精简课程是净化而不是压缩，已在临床实习的高班同学也证明在三四年级所学习的基本课程中有许多浪费的地方，他们认为学得庞杂并不等于渊博，只有把基础的课程精深地细致地学好以后才有可能进行渊博的学习和高深的研究。教授们同意了这样的看法，在全班的师生座谈会上，提出了具体的精简计划和同学一起讨论，结果药理的实验由两个减为一个，许多实验以前是分开做的，现在由各组分工同时进行，做好以后分别报告，最后由教授总结，同时在做实验以前又由教授提出实验的重点和必须阅读的参考书，避免学生们钻牛角尖、乱翻参考书浪费时间。由于药理课程在过去是这样的繁重使得学生不能很好地注意其他课程，病理教授就常常用考试来向学生提起注意，学生们不得不化费很多时间来背诵讲义而实际并无了解；现在学生们已经有时间来预习和温习病理功课了，教授也取消了失去检查学习作用的考试，而将更大的精力和更多的时间集中在病理讲义的讲解方面，学生们随时吸收，学习总时间减少而学习效率提高不少。
    （三）学习互助，巩固成果
    现在，七四班的学生每周学习总时间不超过六十小时，全班的学习计划也拟订了出来，一个星期六天上课，做实验，做报告，自学，讨论，温习和预习的时间都安排得好好的，按照每周各科课程的进度规定了分配了具体的时间。由于功课重压下各人自顾不暇以致学习互助小组流于形式的现象也克服了，在充裕的学习时间和经常饱满健康的学习情绪下，学习小组有计划地掌握学习，小组长随时将同学对于教学的意见反映给教授，使教授了解情况，讲解时的进度既能恰如其分，能随时为同学所接受，又能有的放矢，解决同学疑难不进的关键。互助小组则检讨和克服了过去学习生活上各不相关的情形，各人主动地质疑析难，帮助别人，住宿和吃饭同在一起的便利条件使得他们互助的进展速度更快。学习的成绩是显著的，班上考试的平均成绩打破了历届的纪录，小组的平均分数有高达九十五分的，全班各种课程无一人不及格。
    （四）死书房活跃起来了
    教室里的气氛改变了。从前，上课的钟声打了以后，同学们坐在教室里撑不起眼皮，越用心听越容易睡着，睁开眼睛看看黑板，不知教授又讲什么地方去了，擦着红肿的眼皮，非常报歉地看着教授；教授们也明白，这不是学生的过错；师生只有相对苦笑。下了课，有的人还在沉睡，有的人又忙着准备下一堂的功课，教室里一片死气沉沉。
    现在，学生上课笔挺地坐着，聚精会神地抓住教授的每一句话和每一个字；有了充分的时间作准备，教授们也越讲越有精神。下了课，师生轻松地相对一笑，像是打了一个胜仗。当教授的皮鞋声从教室门口消逝时，教室里歌声笑声顿然响成一片，几个月以前的死气沉沉在这儿连一点影子也不见了，死书房变成了活课堂。
