　　Under the leadership of Stalin's Soviet army,
　　We have been liberated and our lives have improved in the past four years.
　　We deeply understand your earnest instructions:
　　We should lean to one side towards the Soviet Union.
　　Chairman Mao, the day the people of Lushun-Dalian have longed for has finally arrived. "August 15th" and "August 22nd" arrived, and from then on, we stood up, turned ourselves over, and gained liberation.

　　Chairman Mao, you know that here in Lushun-Dalian, there is not only the hard work of the comrades of the Lushun-Dalian Party under your leadership, but more importantly, there is also the direct help of the Soviet army led by our Chinese people's closest friend, Marshal Stalin. They liberated Northeast China on August 15, 1945, and directly liberated Lushun-Dalian on August 22, and in the four years since liberation, the Soviet army has been stationed in Lushun according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, safeguarding peace in the Far East and helping the people of Lushun-Dalian overcome various difficulties and gradually restore production. Now, with their own hard work, the people of Lushun-Dalian have, after four years of arduous construction, transformed Lushun-Dalian from a colony of exploitation and oppression to a position where the people are their own masters in production and construction, from backwardness to progress, from poverty to prosperity, and people's lives have improved, and culture and health have been improving day by day. Regardless of men, women, old or young, unemployment and lack of schooling are basically non-existent. Women workers, who were never allowed to work in heavy industry, now have many who have become lathe operators and locomotive drivers, skillfully mastering modern technology, operating machines, trains, and trams, and among the most outstanding of them are labor heroes and model workers. We are now also carrying out a universal literacy campaign, preparing to basically eliminate illiteracy in the entire region by the end of next year. Chairman Mao, you are absolutely right, we, the people of Lushun-Dalian, have the deepest understanding of the sentence you earnestly instructed the people of the whole country: "The Soviet Union is our closest, most loyal, and reliable friend, and we should lean to one side towards the Soviet Union." Chairman Mao, we must let the people of the whole country and the whole world know about the sincere friendship between the Soviet Union and us; the Soviet Union is our closest, most loyal, and reliable friend.

　　In the year or more after liberation, when Lushun-Dalian was blockaded by US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandits, if it were not for your wise command of the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army to smash the attack of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and victoriously turn to counter-attack and attack; if it were not for the Soviet army's active help in Lushun-Dalian to overcome our difficulties; if it were not for the correct leadership of the Northeast Bureau and the Lushun-Dalian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party under your leadership, the people of Lushun-Dalian would have been subjected to prolonged years of suffering, and even more to cruel torture. Therefore, recalling the past painful history makes us feel even more deeply your close leadership, your great wisdom, and the Soviet army's deep and sincere friendship.

　　Chairman Mao, you and the people of the whole country have spent so long through difficult and arduous years, leading us out of the days of suffering. You have helped us stand up, and from now on we will never be bullied again, and we are no longer the oppressed people of a colonial, semi-colonial, and feudal society! Now you will lead us to build a prosperous and strong new China, and build a free, happy, cultured, and happy new life. Chairman Mao, you come from the people, lead the people, and you have mountain-like great kindness to the people, and the people have ocean-like deep love for you. Our respect and love for you can no longer be expressed in any language. We, the million people of Lushun-Dalian, are determined to express our heartfelt love and respect for you with this guarantee: that is, with the signatures of our millions of people, we express our united determination to follow you forever, always follow your instructions, promote a high degree of internationalism, learn from the Soviet Union, promote a high degree of patriotism, build a new Lushun-Dalian, build a new China, and strive to develop production and culture, so that Lushun-Dalian can play a greater role in the construction of the new China.

　　Chairman Mao, the million people of Lushun-Dalian cheer you in unison: Long live the wise and great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!

　　在斯大林领导的苏军帮助下
　  我们获得了解放四年中生活改善了
    我们深刻体会到您的谆谆指示
　  应向苏联一面倒
    毛主席，我们旅大人民长远盼望的日子终于到来了。“八、一五”“八、二二”到来了，从那时起，我们出了头，翻了身，得到了解放。
    毛主席，您是知道的，我们旅大这里不仅有着您所领导的旅大党的同志们的艰苦奋斗，而且更主要的是还有着我们中国人民最亲密的友人斯大林大元帅所领导的苏军的直接帮助。他们一九四五年八月十五日解放了东北，八月廿二日便直接解放了旅大，而且在解放后直到今天的四年时间以来，苏军根据中苏友好同盟条约驻军旅顺，保卫了远东和平，帮助了我们旅大人民克服种种困难，逐步恢复生产。现在旅大人民用自己的血汗劳动，经过了四年的奋力建设，已经使旅大从殖民地被剥削被压迫的地位走向人民自己作主人的生产建设的地位，从落后走向进步，从贫困走向繁荣，人民生活得到了改善，文化卫生日渐提高。无论男女老少，失业、失学的现象基本上是不存在了。从来都在重工业中不容存身的女工们，现在已有许多人当上了车床手、机车手，熟练地掌握着近代新技术，开动机器，开动火车、电车，并且其中最优秀的一部分还是劳动英雄和生产模范哩。现在我们并已在开展普遍的识字运动，准备在明年年底基本上消灭全地区的文盲。毛主席，您的话一点也不错，我们旅大人民是最深刻体会到您所谆谆指示我们全国人民的这句话：“苏联是我们最亲密最忠实可靠的友人，我们应向苏联一面倒。”毛主席：我们一定要让全国全世界人民都知道苏联和我们的真诚友谊；苏联是我们最亲密最忠实可靠的友人。
    在解放不久后，即被美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪徒封锁了的旅大的一年多的岁月里，若不是您英明地指挥着人民解放军英勇无敌地粉碎了蒋介石匪徒的进攻，而且胜利地转入反攻与进攻；若不是苏军在旅大的积极帮助我们克服困难；若不是您所领导的东北局和中共旅大区党委的正确领导，我们旅大人民将会被延长苦难的岁月，与更要遭受到残酷的折磨。因此回想起过去那惨痛的历史，就更使我们深深地感到您的领导的亲切，您的伟大英明，以及苏军深厚的真挚的友谊。
    毛主席，您和我们全国人民一块渡过了如此长久的艰难困苦的岁月，领导我们走出了苦难的日子，您扶持着我们站立起来了，从此我们再也不会受欺侮了，再也不是殖民地半殖民地封建被压迫的人民了！现在您又要领导我们建设一个繁荣昌盛的新中国，建设起自由美满文化幸福的新生活。毛主席：您来自人民，领导人民，您对人民有着山岳般的重大的恩情，人民对您也有着海洋般的深厚的爱戴。我们对您的敬爱再也没有什么语言所能表达出来的了。我们旅大百万人民决心这样的保证，来表达我们对您的衷心热爱与崇敬。那就是：以我们千千万万人民的签名，表示我们团结一心的永远跟着您走，永远遵照着您的指示，发扬高度的国际主义，向苏联学习，发扬高度的爱国主义，建设新旅大，建设新中国，努力发展生产与文化，使旅大能在新中国的建设事业中起她更进一步的作用。
    毛主席，我们旅大百万人民向您齐声欢呼：英明伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
