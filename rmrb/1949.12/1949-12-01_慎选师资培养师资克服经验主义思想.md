　　Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate and carefully select teachers and improve teaching methods. We have a total of forty-five teachers, mainly cadres currently on the job who serve concurrently, and externally hired teachers account for only one-third (all compensated appropriately based on teaching hours). Most of the externally hired teachers have rich teaching experience, but they are not familiar with the students' thoughts, lives, and characteristics, and they are not bold enough in guiding students' learning. Apart from lecturing in the classroom, they have few opportunities to get close to the students. Cadres on the job who serve as teachers concurrently are familiar with the students' situation, which facilitates guiding their learning, and they have a serious attitude towards work, but they lack teaching experience. Based on this situation, externally hired teachers are necessary, and they should be respected, helped, and encouraged to be bold and responsible, and to have close relationships with the students. For cadres on the job, their busy work should be taken into consideration, and they should be given ample time to prepare lessons, study teaching methods more, and hold regular teaching affairs meetings so that the experiences of both can be exchanged.

　　The quality of teachers has a great impact on students' learning enthusiasm, interest, and academic performance. Therefore, teachers must be carefully selected and attention must be paid to cultivating them in their work. Teachers should not be easily replaced. In some schools, a course was changed three times in four months, causing dissatisfaction among the students, and making it impossible to carry out planned cultivation for the teachers. It is better to have externally hired teachers for arithmetic and natural science because they have a high level of professional competence and we lack such talent the most. We must attach great importance to this work in order to solve the difficulty of the shortage of teachers.

　　The biggest problem teachers encounter in teaching is that the students are all adults with poor memory but strong comprehension. For every question, they always want to ask "why." Teachers must adapt to this characteristic, and for each question, they must not only explain what it is like, but also why it is like that.

　　Third, overcome empiricism and impatience in learning. There is a narrow empiricist learning ideology and an impatient "instant success" mentality among the students. Therefore, when studying Chinese, they only like practical writing (which is of course necessary) and are unwilling to study literary works, etc. When learning arithmetic, they start from calculating their own bean curd accounts, feel that it is not as fast as abacus and mental arithmetic, and feel that learning the four arithmetic operations is useless. They do not understand that arithmetic is an indispensable basic course for building a modern national defense army.

　　Furthermore, when learning Chinese and arithmetic, they feel that there are no more profound principles, and think they have learned well as long as they understand, and are unwilling to delve into and work hard to apply them skillfully in homework. Cultural learning can only achieve good results by strengthening careful study and deliberation in homework. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the phenomenon of neglecting homework in teaching, and the quality of usual homework should be taken as the main standard of academic performance.

　　Fourth, promote teaching democracy and unify teaching work. In spare-time schools, teachers and students have little contact apart from class time, and there is no spare time for activities, which hinders the unity of teaching and learning. In order to overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to extract one-fifth or one-quarter of the class time for classroom questioning, answering questions, reviewing, and doing homework, in order to enhance mutual understanding and help between teachers and students, and correct shortcomings in teaching. More importantly, teaching conferences should be held regularly, and teaching should be improved, opinions exchanged, and teaching work unified through mass criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, a full-time teacher should be hired for each course, which is very necessary to strengthen teaching links and improve teaching.

　　Fifth, there are several issues that need to be resolved correctly: (1) Correct the narrow tendency of linking theory to practice in cultural learning. Some comrades have confused ideas about how cultural learning should be linked to practice, thinking that when teaching Chinese, more should be taught about writing receipts, notices, and reports; and when teaching arithmetic, more should be taught about calculating subsidies and statistics of weapons and ammunition, which is considered linking theory to practice. Therefore, they feel that textbooks are not suitable for the actual situation of the army (of course, it is good to talk more about content related to the daily life of the army). This is a narrow view that does not conform to the purpose and direction of our cultural learning. The purpose of learning Chinese is to improve reading and writing ability. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to only learn practical writing. It is necessary to guide students to appreciate literary works, read essays, and gradually master literary tools to express the content of their thoughts. The purpose of learning arithmetic is to exercise the degree of rigorous and accurate thinking and reasoning ability, and to lay the foundation for learning mathematics, physics, and chemistry in the future, so as to better master military science in the future. Narrowly linking theory to practice is incorrect.

　　Cultural learning, of course, must be linked to practice, and its specific link to practice is homework—practicing writing essays and doing exercises. The process of students doing homework is the process of linking theory to practice.

　　(2) The contradiction between work and learning is the main difficulty currently facing various branch schools. Because the students are busy with work and have excessive burdens, some individuals have requested to withdraw from school. Wherever such phenomena exist, in addition to a few students who do not yet have a conscious awareness of learning, the main reason is that the leadership has not attached importance to the cultural supplementary education of cadres on the job, and has not provided cadres with the necessary learning time and conditions, and has not actively urged them to learn.

### 慎选师资培养师资克服经验主义思想

　　慎选师资培养师资克服经验主义思想
    其次，须要培养与慎选师资，改进教学。我们共有四十五个教员，主要的是在职干部兼任的，外聘教员只占三分之一（均依授课时数，经以相当酬金。）外聘教员大部有丰富的教学经验，只是不熟悉学员的思想、生活和特点，指导学员学习不够大胆，除了课堂上讲授外没有更多的机会去接近学员。在职干部兼任教员对学员情况熟悉，便于指导学员学习，工作态度认真，但是缺乏教学经验。根据这种情况来看，外聘教员是必须的，应该尊重他们，加以帮助，启发他们大胆负责，密切与学员的关系。对在职干部应照顾他们的工作忙的情况，给予充分的准备课的时间，多研究教学方法，并经常召开教务会议，使两者经验得到交流。
    教员好坏对学员学习情绪和兴趣，学习的成绩影响极大。所以须慎选师资，并注意从工作中培养。教员不要轻易调换。有的学校一门课在四个月中，调换了三个教员，引起学员的不满，对教员说，也无法进行有计划的培养。算术和自然科学的教员以外聘教员为好，他们业务水平高，我们最缺乏这样的人材，必须十分重视这个工作，才能解决师资缺乏的困难。
    教员在讲授中碰到的最大问题是学员都是成年人，记忆力差，理解力强，对每一个问题，总要问个“为什么”；教员必须适应这个特点，对每个问题不仅要讲是怎么样，而且要讲为什么要怎么样。
    第三，克服学习中的经验主义和急躁情绪。学员中存在有狭隘经验主义的学习思想，和“立竿见影”的急躁情绪，因此学国文只喜欢应用文（当然是必要的），不愿学文艺作品等；学算术从自己算豆腐帐出发，觉得不如珠算和心算来得快，学四则就感到没有用了。不了解要建设现代化的国防军，算术是不可少的基础课程。
    再，在学国文、算术时觉得没有更深奥的道理，听懂了就算学好了，不肯钻研与下功夫在作业中去熟练的运用，文化学习只有加强作业中精心的钻研、琢磨才会收到良好效果。因此，须在教学中纠正忽视作业的现象，要把平时作业的好坏，作为学习成绩的主要标准。
    第四，发扬教学民主，统一教学工作。工余补习学校除了上课时间以外，教员和学员的接触很少，没有课余的时间进行活动，妨碍了教与学的统一。为了克服这一缺点，就有必要抽出上课时间的五分之一或四分之一，进行课堂上的质疑解答问题，进行复习，作业，以便增进教员和学员的互相了解，互相帮助，纠正教学中的缺点。更重要是定期召开教学会议，用群众性的批评和自我批评的方法，改进教学，交换意见，统一教学工作。同时每门课程应聘设专任教员，这是加强教学联系，改进教学所非常必需的。
    第五，有几个问题，有待求得正确解决：（一）纠正文化学习中狭隘的联系实际的偏向。有些同志对文化学习怎样联系实际存在着糊涂观念，认为讲国文应多讲些打收条、写通知、做报告；讲算术多讲些算津贴费、统计武器、弹药，这才算联系实际。因此就觉得课本不适合军队的实际（当然多讲些军队日常生活有联系的内容是好的），这是一种狭隘的看法，是不符合我们学文化的目的和方针的。学国文的目的是要提高阅读能力和写作能力，要达到这样目的只学应用文是不行的，必须引导去欣赏些文学作品，读些论文，逐步掌握文学的工具，去表现思想的内容。学算术要锻炼思考缜密和精确的程度和推理的能力，为今后学数学、理化打下基础，以便将来更好的掌握军事科学。狭隘的联系实际，是不正确的。
    文化学习当然是要联系实际的，其具体的联系实际就是作业——练习作文和演算习题。学员的作业过程，就是联系实际的过程。
    （二）工作和学习的矛盾，这是目前各分校主要的难题。学员因工作忙，负担过重，致有个别人要求退学。凡是存在这类现象的，除少数学员尚未有学习的自觉外，主要原因是领导上未将在职干部的文化补习重视起来，而给干部以必要的学习时间和条件，并积极督促学习。
