Huangguantun Railway Factory Learns from Soviet Experience
Promotes Continuous Operation Method
Production Efficiency Improves, Costs Decrease

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Huangguantun Vehicle Factory of the Northeast Railway Bureau began piloting the continuous production method in the freight car branch factory in July, it has achieved significant results and has been universally promoted in all departments of the factory starting on November 1st. The entire production process of this operation method has been filmed by the Beijing Film Studio. Continuous production operation is a Soviet production management method. After the factory leadership decided to learn from Soviet experience and implement this method, it began piloting it in the freight car branch factory and immediately achieved rapid results: the number of days each new freight car spent in the factory was immediately reduced from ten days to 3.25 days, and labor was reduced from 154 to 145. Production increased from an average monthly output of 18.5 vehicles in the first half of the year to 38 vehicles. The continued trial run further proved the superiority of the Soviet socialist production management method. In October, the labor required per vehicle was reduced to 103.5 (130 in August, 118 in September), and the monthly output increased to 56 vehicles (42 in August, 51 in September). However, the total number of people in the factory, including direct and indirect production personnel, decreased by 16.6% compared to the average daily number in the first half of the year. In terms of quality, the strengthening of the inspection system, especially the fixing of workers' production tasks, has also greatly improved quality. In October, only one of the twenty vehicles delivered to the Railway Bureau was returned for repair due to loose screws. Before the implementation of the new operation method, almost all vehicles delivered to the Railway Bureau were returned for repair. In terms of cost, due to the reduction of labor, the improvement of efficiency, and the relative reduction of management fees, the cost per vehicle decreased by 15.4% compared to the first half of the year. At the same time, it also spurred the foundry branch factory, which had never completed its production tasks since liberation, to complete its monthly task in October.

The four-month trial period fully demonstrated that continuous production operation is far superior to the past parallel production operation. The main manifestations are: concentrating the dispersed workshops into one workshop and arranging them sequentially on a line according to the order of the production process, thereby eliminating the waste of transportation caused by dispersing the continuous production process in different workshops without organization or planning in the past. Continuous production operation makes the entire production process as seamless as flowing water, eliminating the phenomenon of parallel production methods where the time and quantity of completion of each group are extremely inconsistent, affecting the composition of the car body, due to the manufacturing being carried out by groups and departments, with each group having its own plan. Precisely because the time and quantity of completion are extremely inconsistent, the phenomenon arises that if a certain group falls behind, it is anxious to catch up, and the work is sloppy, affecting the quality. This phenomenon is impossible to produce with the continuous production operation method.

During the trial period, the factory management committee and the trade union cooperated closely. For example, the factory management committee held timely meetings to help the freight car branch factory formulate plans and solve the supply of raw materials and parts. The trade union played a significant role in helping employees resolve ideological concerns.

### 皇姑屯铁路工厂学习苏联经验  推广连续作业法  生产效率提高成本减低

　　皇姑屯铁路工厂学习苏联经验
    推广连续作业法
    生产效率提高成本减低
    【本报讯】东北铁路总局皇姑屯车辆工厂，自七月份在货车分厂试行连续制作业法后，已收到显著效果，并于十一月一日起在全厂各部门普遍推广。该作业法的整个生产过程，已由北京电影制片厂拍成影片。连续制作业系苏联的生产管理方法，该厂领导决定学习苏联经验实行该法后，开始在货车分厂试行，当即迅速收到效果：每辆新造货车在厂数日立即由十天缩减至三．二五天，人工亦由一百五十四降至一百四十五，产量由上半年平均月产十八．五辆上升至三十八辆。继续试行的结果，愈加证明苏联的社会主义生产管理方法的优越性，在十月份，每台车所需之人工已减至一○三．五（八月份为一百三十，九月份为一百十八），月产量增加到五十六辆（八月份为四十二辆，九月份为五十一辆），然而全厂人数包括直接与间接的生产人员在内，却较上半年平均每日减少了百分之十六．六。在质量方面，由于加强检查制度特别是工人生产任务的固定，亦大大提高，十月份在送交路局的二十台车中，只有一台因螺丝未拧紧而被回修。而在实行新作业法前，送交路局的车辆，几乎是全部回修。在成本方面，也因为人工的减少、效率的提高，管理费随之相对的减少，因而每台车的成本较上半年减少了百分之十五．四。与此同时，更带动了自解放后从未完成生产任务的翻砂分厂于十月份完成全月任务。
    四个月的试行期间，充分证明连续制作业远较过去的平行制作业为优越，主要表现在：将分散的作业场集中到一个车间，按生产过程的先后，顺序排列在一条线上，这样就免去过去由于无组织无计划地将连续的生产过程分散于不同的车间而产生的运搬浪费。而连续制作业由于使整个生产过程衔接得象流水似的毫不间断，就消灭了平行制作业法由于分组分部制造、各组有自己的计划、完活的时间及数量极不一致影响车体组成的现象。正因为完活的时间及数量极不一致，就产生了这样的现象：即如果某一组落后，它就急于赶活，工作就潦草，影响到质量。这种现象是连续制作业法不可能产生的。
    试行期间，工厂管委会及工会均密切配合。如工厂管委会及时召集会议，帮助货车分厂制订计划，解决原材料部分品的供应。工会则在帮助员工解决思想顾虑方面起到很大作用。
