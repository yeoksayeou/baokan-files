　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 15th: General Yang Hucheng, who was imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek for twelve years, has now been confirmed to have been murdered by Kuomintang secret service bandits two months before the liberation of Chongqing. His remains were unearthed on the 11th on a dirt platform in the garden to the right of the residence of secret service leader Dai Li in Ciqikou, a suburb of western Chongqing. Yang's remains had his hands tied behind his back with rope, his feet bound together, and his mouth tightly bound with cloth strips and rope. He was lying face down in the earthen pit with no bloodstains on his body. According to people inside the Chiang bandit concentration camp, Yang was first electrocuted but did not die, and was finally pushed into the earthen pit and buried alive. Beneath Yang's body was the body of his second son, Yang Youzheng, whose waist had been cut in two. Youzheng was about twenty years old this year and accompanied his father in a long prison life. Next to Yang's body was a wooden box containing ashes, which were the ashes of Yang's wife. Two years ago, Yang's wife died in prison from starvation after being unable to bear the surveillance and insults of secret service bandits for forty days. Yang cremated her and collected her ashes to carry with him. Yang's remains had begun to rot, but his former subordinates Hu Sangao, An Zhixian, and Qin Yimin, a fellow villager from Pucheng, Shaanxi, identified him from ten characteristics of the remains, including his tall stature, broad chest, large skull, long face, long beard, and clothing. At the same time as Yang, his secretary Song Qiyun, his wife, and his son were also murdered. Their remains were unearthed in a small room on a slope to the left of Dai's bandit residence. The circumstances of the murders of Yang and Song were extremely secret, and even few within the bandit gang knew about them. This discovery was due to the confession of eleven secret service policemen who were on guard duty at the time. It is reported that the killing time was September 17th of this year, a few days after General Yang was escorted back to Chongqing from Guizhou. According to insiders, Yang's twelve years of prison life went as follows: Yang was arrested after the July 7th Incident and was initially imprisoned in Jiangxi, and later moved to Yangming Cave in Kaiyang, Guizhou, accompanied by his wife and second son. After the Japanese surrendered, Yang was moved to Dai's bandit residence in Ciqikou, a suburb of western Chongqing. His wife died of starvation, and Yang was deeply affected. During the period of Chiang bandit's pretended peace talks in January and February of this year, secret service leader Mao Renfeng secretly escorted Yang and his son to Guiyang, and Song Qiyun and his wife and son were also there. Two months ago, as the People's Liberation Army was about to march into Southwest China, Chiang bandits urgently escorted Yang, Song, and the other five people back to Chongqing and secretly executed them. The situation of the discovery of Yang's remains on the 11th has been filmed by the Beijing Film Studio film crew; the remains were placed in coffins by personnel sent by the Chongqing Military Control Commission. Soon, all circles in Chongqing will hold a grand memorial service for Yang and the martyrs who were massacred by special agents three days before the liberation of Chongqing on "November 27th" at the same time, and accuse the Kuomintang reactionaries of their heinous crimes to the whole country and the whole world.

　　重庆解放前匪特下毒手
    杨虎城将军惨遭杀害
    渝各界将举行隆重追悼大会
    【新华社重庆十五日电】被蒋介石囚禁十二年之久的杨虎城将军，现已查明在重庆解放前两个月为国民党特务匪徒杀害，其遗体已于十一日在重庆西郊磁器口特务头子戴笠住宅右侧之花园土台上挖出。杨氏遗体两手被绳反绑，两足并捆，嘴上用布条和绳索紧勒，面部向下卧在土坑内，身上无血迹。据蒋匪集中营内部的人说：杨氏是先受电刑未死，最后被推入土坑活埋的。杨氏身下是他的次公子杨幼拯的遗体，腰部已被切为两段。幼拯今年约二十岁，随乃父度长年监狱生活。杨氏身边有一木匣，内盛灰骨，这是杨夫人的骨灰，两年前杨夫人在狱中因不堪特务匪徒监视和侮辱，愤而绝食，四十天才死去，杨氏将它火化，收集骨灰随身携带。杨氏遗体已开始腐烂，但经他的旧部下胡三高、安志贤和陕西蒲城的同乡秦一民三人从遗体的身材魁梧，胸腔宽阔，头骨大，脸部长，有长须及服装等十种特征，继定是杨氏无疑。与杨氏同时被害的还有他的秘书宋绮云及其夫人和公子。他们的遗体在戴匪住宅左侧坡下一个小房间内挖出。杨、宋两氏被害情形极为隐秘，即匪徒内部亦绝少知道。这次发现是由于十一个当时站岗放哨的特务警察供出的。杀害时间据悉为今年九月十七日，当时杨将军由贵州被押回重庆后不几天。据知悉内幕者叙述杨氏十二年监狱生活经过说：杨氏在七七事变后被捕，最初囚于江西，后移贵州开阳阳明洞，夫人及次子作陪。日冠投降后，杨氏又被移住重庆西郊磁器口的戴匪住宅，夫人绝食而死，杨氏受刺激甚深。今年一二月蒋匪伪装和谈时期，特务头子毛人凤将杨氏父子秘密押往贵阳，宋绮云夫妇公子亦在。两月前，因解放军进军大西南在即，蒋匪急将杨宋两氏等五人押回重庆，秘密处死。十一日发现杨氏遗体情形，已由北京制片厂电影队拍成电影；遗体由重庆军管会派员盛殓。不久重庆各界将为杨氏与重庆解放前三天——“一一、二七”被特务屠杀的殉难者同时举行隆重追悼大会，并向全国全世界控诉国民党反动派之滔天罪行。
