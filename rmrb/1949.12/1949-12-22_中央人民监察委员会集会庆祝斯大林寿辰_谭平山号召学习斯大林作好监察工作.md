　　Central People's Supervisory Committee Holds Gathering to Celebrate Stalin's Birthday
    Tan Pingshan Calls for Learning from Stalin to Improve Supervisory Work
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central People's Supervisory Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM on the 21st to celebrate the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin. At the same time, the establishment of a branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was announced. Those present included Director Tan Pingshan, Deputy Director Liu Jingfan, and more than 70 others. After Chairman Guo Renzhi reported the significance of the meeting, Director Tan Pingshan, Deputy Director Liu Jingfan, and others spoke.
    In his speech, Tan Pingshan emphasized Stalin's great assistance to the Chinese revolution and introduced Stalin's great deeds in undertaking supervisory work in 1919 under the difficult conditions of a lack of cadres and the fact that the majority of the People's Commissariat of State Control was initially in the hands of a group of corrupt and reactionary Tsarist officials. He said: Stalin's enthusiastic work and his style of relying on the masses greatly promoted the Soviet socialist supervisory work. He laid down two major tasks for this work: (1) Supervisory workers should assist the central and local executive comrades in establishing the most appropriate method of accounting for state property and assist in rectifying supply and economic institutions. (2) The Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department should cultivate leaders from among the workers and peasants who are capable of mastering the entire institution in the course of its work. In simple terms, supervisory work is not only passively punishing waste, corruption, and stagnation after the fact, but also actively preventing the occurrence of such morbidities beforehand. In addition to this, there is further work to be done, which is to accumulate experience in socialist construction and assist worker and peasant cadres in various departments of the national economy. Finally, he called on us to follow Chairman Mao's words: "We must celebrate him, support him, and learn from him." In his speech, Deputy Director Liu Jingfan called for responding to Chairman Mao's call: to study Stalin's theory and thought, to learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building the country, and to do a good job in the people's supervisory work. Zhang Muyao, Ning Wu, Gan Cisen, Fang Gang and other departments then delivered speeches. This was followed by the presentation of longevity characters, the presentation of flowers, the recitation of birthday poems, and the chorus of "Ode to Stalin" by all. The loud and solemn singing encouraged everyone's hearts—we will forever follow Stalin. Finally, amidst the cheers of "Long live Marshal Stalin, long live Chairman Mao, long live the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union," the meeting was happily adjourned.

　　中央人民监察委员会集会庆祝斯大林寿辰
    谭平山号召学习斯大林作好监察工作
    【本报讯】中央人民监察委员会，于二十一日上午十时，举行庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰大会，同时并宣布成立中苏友好协会支会。到会者，计有谭平山主任、刘景范副主任等七十余人，大会由主席郭任之报告开会意义后，谭平山主任、刘景范副主任等讲话。
    谭平山在讲话中着重阐述了斯大林对中国革命的伟大援助，并介绍了一九一九年斯大林在干部缺乏而且最初的国家监察人民委员会大部分掌握在一批腐旧的反动的沙皇官吏的手中的困难条件下，担任监察工作的伟大事迹。他说：斯大林的热情工作与他依靠群众的作风，大大地推进了苏联社会主义的监察工作。他订出这种工作的两大任务：（一）监察工作者要协助中央和地方的执政同志们确立最适当的统计国家财产的方式，协助整顿供应机构和经济机构。（二）工农监察部在其工作过程中要从工农中间培养出足以掌握整个机构的指导者。简单地说，监察工作不仅是消极的于事后征治浪费，贪污与呆滞。也要积极的在事前防止这种病态的发生。除此以外，还有更进一步的工作，便是积蓄社会主义的建设经验，协助国民经济各部门的工农干部。最后他号召按照毛主席的话：“我们要庆祝他，拥护他，学习他。”刘景范副主任在讲话中，他号召响应毛主席的号召：学习斯大林的理论和思想，学习苏联的建国经验，搞好人民的监察工作。继之张慕尧、寗武、甘祠森、方刚等部发表了讲话。接着即献寿字、献花、朗颂祝寿诗并由全体合唱“斯大林颂”，嘹亮而庄严的歌声，鼓舞着每个人的心灵——我们要永远的跟着斯大林。最后在斯大林大元帅万岁，毛主席万岁，中苏两国友好合作万岁的欢呼声中，愉快地宣布散会。
