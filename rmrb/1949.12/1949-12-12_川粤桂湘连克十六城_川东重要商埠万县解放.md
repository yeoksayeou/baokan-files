Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 11th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army actively suppressed bandits in southern Hunan, successively capturing four cities including Jianghua, Linwu, Jiahe, and Lanshan, capturing more than 1,800 officers and soldiers below the deputy commander, chief of staff, and director of the political work office of the bandit Southern Hunan Column. The bandits in southern Hunan were the so-called "rear enemy armed forces" that the Bai bandits had planned to leave behind before fleeing, including four bandit transportation police general teams, the Bao Yi Division, and the Southern Hunan Column, totaling 20,000 bandits. Under the command of Wang Chunhui, the chief of the Southeast Office of the bandit Military Statistics Bureau's Transportation Police, these bandits roamed the Linwu, Jiahe, and Lanshan areas, disrupting our rear area construction and harming the people. In order to stabilize social order and rapidly restore production and construction, the Hunan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army established the Hunan Bandit Suppression Headquarters on the 21st of last month, with a certain field army unit as the main force, coordinating with the local armed forces of the Chenzhou Military Subdistrict to launch a large-scale suppression campaign. On the 1st of this month, Jianghua and Linwu were captured first, capturing more than 300 bandits. Then, with rapid actions, the Jiuyi Mountain area and the Huayin Mountain area were sealed off, cutting off the bandits' two escape routes to Guangdong. Then, they immediately attacked northward, capturing more than 100 bandits, and then surrounded Xintian and Ningyuan. Another unit of the Liberation Army, compressing southward, formed a vast encirclement of all the bandit units. On the 6th, Jiahe City was liberated, capturing more than 100 bandits. On the same day at 6 pm, a certain regiment of the unit launched a surprise attack from a distance of 200 li, defeating the bandit troops blocking the way along the route, and broke into Lanshan City in one fell swoop, capturing more than 1,300 people below the deputy commander, chief of staff, and director of the political work office of the bandit Southern Hunan Column. At this point, all the remaining bandits have been surrounded by the Liberation Army in the Huayin Mountain area of the Jiahe, Linwu, and Lanshan triangle. Our bandit suppression troops are conducting searches from all directions to the mountainous area.
