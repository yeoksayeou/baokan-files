　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (45)
    Forty: Old Bai
    Kang Tuo
    Let's return to the story of how Old Yin went to the district to attend a land reform conference for more than half a month, and then returned to Black Stone Slope Village. At this conference, he listened to reports on the current situation, studied the Land Law Outline of China decided by the Communist Party's National Land Conference, and examined his own thoughts and work style over the years. He also reflected on the work in Black Stone Slope, feeling that there were no major mistakes, but the implementation of the mass line was not free enough. The village of two hundred households only organized a dozen or so poor peasant groups, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses was not well mobilized. As a result, several cadres were overwhelmed, but the work was neither hot nor cold, neither good nor bad. Therefore, he decided to expand the poor peasant groups and establish poor peasant leagues as soon as he returned, to boldly mobilize the masses to properly classify class status, carry out struggle, and prepare for land distribution, while combining this with organizing coal mine production. In addition, he thought that our People's Liberation War had already turned to the offensive, and that the Party Central Committee, based on the revolutionary task of thoroughly eliminating feudalism and the land demands of the broad masses of peasants, had decided on a policy of equal distribution of land, which would surely be warmly welcomed by the peasants of Black Stone Slope Village. He was full of joy, and his enthusiasm for returning to work was even greater than before.
    This time, there was also another cadre accompanying Old Yin to work, and this person was Old Bai, a long-time comrade of Da San. He had originally been transferred to another region to work in the trade union, and this time he went to the countryside to participate in land reform. In order to learn more about the situation of industry and mining, he chose to go to Black Stone Slope in Pinding County. He was also a Communist Party member and participated in the leadership of the District Party Committee. He remembered that Da San had said in the past that Black Stone Slope had a very large coal mine. After Japan surrendered, he came to Black Stone Slope and heard that the mine had been flooded. This time he wanted to understand the mine, so he chose to work in this village.
    It is said that when Old Yin and Old Bai came to Black Stone Slope together, Old Yin told Old Bai about the situation in the village and the work being done, and asked for Old Bai's opinion on how to proceed after returning. Old Bai usually didn't talk much, and he always liked to listen to other people's opinions first when it came to work. Only when he had his own ideas would he finally say a few words, so at that time he asked Old Yin: "What do you think?" Old Yin said: "I've already said it! My self-criticism in the past is that I wasn't free enough, and in the future, the main thing is to overcome this. What do you think?" Old Bai still didn't speak. Old Yin was thinking that Old Bai was from a worker's background, a native of Shanxi, and a member of the District Committee, while he himself was from Hebei, from an intellectual background, and from a middle peasant family. At the land conference, everyone criticized him for often not having a very clear class viewpoint in his past work, so he should learn from Old Bai. Therefore, he repeatedly asked Old Bai to give his opinion. Old Bai said: "I don't understand the situation. If you want me to say, I'm afraid you haven't paid enough attention to the characteristics of the industrial and mining area here, don't you think?" Old Yin tilted his head and thought for a while, and hurriedly said: "That's not necessarily the case. I did pay attention to it, but the focus of work hasn't shifted to production. Besides, everyone in the village is clamoring to open the mine, but the problem is very complicated. The capital and managers are difficult to solve, people have many opinions, I don't know how to handle it, and I don't have time, so I have to put it aside for the time being. But your opinion is very good, I'll consider it further!" When Old Bai heard him say so much as soon as he opened his mouth, and he really didn't understand the situation, he didn't say anything else, just quickened his pace and walked forward.
    After the two of them arrived in the village, the whole village knew it in an instant. Da San immediately looked for Old Bai. When the two met, they immediately went to Da San's house and talked non-stop. Old Yin also talked with the cadres for a while, but saw that the clothes and furniture in the village had not yet been distributed, and that Shuan Cheng had told him about how the people were arguing about opening the mine, how Yu Bao had confessed and been detained, a whole bunch of new things. He told the cadres about the equal distribution of land, and Bian Xiao was happy and said: "This will give those who grow the land a solid foundation!" But others didn't seem particularly happy! Old Yin tilted his head, his eyelids fluttering anxiously as he thought, feeling that his excitement had been dampened by half: Why is that? But he suddenly remembered Old Bai's suggestion! That's right! Land reform is important, but if people have nothing to eat or do, how can they be in the mood to attend meetings and reform all day long! Besides, the land here is not enough to eat on its own! When Old Bai gave him his opinion earlier, he hadn't understood this, always feeling that he had paid attention to production and opening the mine. In fact, when he was in the village, the masses' demands to open the mine were already very loud, and the leaders of the Hua Da company had also proposed several times that land reform should be combined with production. But he, because he was not familiar with industrial and mining production, and was busy circling around in trivial matters, turned a blind eye to the big problems in the masses' lives, and bowed his head in the face of difficulties, not doing a good job of investigation and research and learning. Isn't this clearly his own mistake? Thinking of this, he felt relieved. He talked with the cadres for a while, and then hurried to find Old Bai.
    He ran to Da San's house, but only Old Bai was there. Old Bai said that he hadn't seen Da San for many years, and Da San insisted on having a drink, so he went to buy wine. Old Yin didn't think this was very appropriate, but he endured it and first told Old Bai about the situation in the village, and then made a self-criticism, admitting that he had indeed not paid attention to the characteristics of the industrial and mining area, and accepted Old Bai's opinion. Afterwards, he also pointed out: "It's not a good influence that you started drinking with people as soon as you arrived." Old Bai laughed: "Right! We know that too, but we comrades like this when we get together! Let's go, we won't drink anymore, let's talk about work." Old Yin said: "Aren't you going to wait for Da San to come back and say goodbye?" Old Bai said: "No need!" After saying that, he left. Tian Lu's wife chased out from the next room and stopped Old Yin, saying: "We three brothers will come back! Comrade Yin, please let this comrade wait a little longer!" Old Bai said to her: "I'll come to your house again." And pulled Old Yin out.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４５）
    四十　老白
    康濯
    这理再说老尹去分区参加了半月多土地会议，又回到了黑石坡村。在这个会上，他听了目前形势的报告，学习了共产党全国土地会议决定的中国土地法大纲，并检查了自己多年来的思想和作风；他对黑石坡的工作也进行了反省，觉得这里没什么大错误，只是执行群众路线上还很放手，二百来户的村子，贫农组才组织了十来个人，广大群众的积极性没有很好发动，结果几个干部忙得一塌糊涂，工作却只是不冷不热不好不赖。因此，他决定一回去就扩大贫农组成立贫农团，放手发动群众来划好成份、清理斗争、准备分地，并结合着组织开窑生产。此外，他想到我们人民解放战争已经转入了进攻，又想到这次党中央根据彻底消灭封建的革命任务，和广大农民的土地要求，决定了平分土地的政策，这一定会得到黑石坡村农民的热烈欢迎的。他满心高兴，回去工作的劲头比过去还大。
    这回并且又多了个干部跟老尹一道去工作，这人就是大三的老伙计老白。他原来调到别的地区作工会工作去了，这回下乡参加土地改革，为了多了解些工矿情形，就选定了到平定县黑石坡这个区；他也是共产党员，并参加这个区里党委会的领导。他记得过去大三说过，黑石坡有座好大窑，日本投降后他到黑石坡来，又听说那窑淹了；这回他想了解一下这窑，所以就选定到这个村来工作了。
    却说老尹老白二人相跟来黑石坡的时候，老尹把村里的情况和工作给老白说了说，并征求老白的意见，看回去了怎么闹；老白这人平日还是话说不多，对工作是总好先听听别人的意见，赶自己有了主张了，最后才三言两语说说话的，所以当时他就反问老尹道：“你说呢？”老尹说：“我都说了嘛！我检讨过去就是放手不够，往后主要的也就是要克服这。你看呢？”老白还是不说话；老尹却想着老白是工人出身，是山西本地人，又是区委，而自己是河北人，是知识份子出身，家里又是中农成份，土地会议上，大家又批评他过去工作中往往阶级观点不很明确，这正该跟老白好好学习；因此，他便再三要求老白说说意见。老白道：“我是不了解情况。要说嘛，你怕没有很好注意这里工矿区的特点，你看是不是？”老尹仰着脖子想了想，忙说：“这倒不一定。注意是注意了的，只是工作重心没转入生产，再说，村里倒也都嚷着要开窑，可问题复杂得很，本钱，经管人又都很难解决，人们意见又多，我又不摸门，也没工夫，只好暂搁下了。不过你这意见很好，我再考虑考虑吧！”老白一听他开口就说了这么一大套，而自己却的确不了解情况，也就再不说什么，只加快脚步往前走了。
    他两个到村以后，一刹时浑村都知道了，大三立时就寻老白，二人见面，忙相跟去了大三家，嘴不休停地捣拉开了。老尹当下也跟干部们谈说了一阵，却见村里衣裳家具都还没分，拴成他们告给他的，又是老百姓为开窑的事怎么咯吵得满天风雨，玉宝如何坦白和被扣，尽一把子新事情；他给干部们说了说平分土地的事，扁小倒高兴地道：“这可是养种地的就扎下根基啦！”别人却没什么特外欢喜的劲头！老尹仰着脖子眼皮急忙忙扑展着左思右想，只觉自己的高兴劲冷了半截：这是为什么啊？但他猛地想起老白提的意见来了！可不！土地改革是重要，不过人们没吃的没干的，又怎么有心思成天来开会和改革！再说，这地势光靠土地原本就是不够吃的哩！老白先前给他提意见的时候，他还没想通这，总觉着自己还是注意生产开窑的；其实，自己在村里的时候，群众开窑的要求就嚷得那么热闹，华大领导上也好几回提出土改要跟生产结合，自己却因为不熟悉工矿生产，又忙着在琐碎事务里头打圈子，对群众生活的大问题熟视无睹，在困难面前低头，不好好调查研究和学习；这不明明是自己的错误么？想到这里，他痛快了，他又跟干部们捣拉了一阵，就赶紧寻老白去。
    他跑到大三家，只老白一个人在，老白说是跟大三多年不见，大三非要喝喝不行，他打酒去了；老尹觉得这不怎么对付，但他忍了忍，先对老白说了说村里的情况，接着便进行自我检讨，承认自己的确没注意工矿特点，并且接受老白的意见。随后，他却也提出：“你一来就跟人喝酒，影响不好。”老白笑道：“对！咱也知道这，可咱们这些伙计到一块，就欢喜这的！走吧，不喝了，谈工作去。”老尹说：“你不等大三回来说一声？”老白说：“不用啦！”说完就走；天禄他老婆从隔壁屋里追出来叫住老尹道：“咱三兄弟就回嘛！尹同志你让这位同志等等吧！”老白对她说：“我黑家再来。”就拉老尹出来了。
