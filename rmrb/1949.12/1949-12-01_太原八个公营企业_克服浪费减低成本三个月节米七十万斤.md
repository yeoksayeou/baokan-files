Taiyuan's Eight Public Enterprises
Overcome Waste and Reduce Costs, Saving 700,000 Jin of Millet in Three Months

[Report from this newspaper] Since Taiyuan's public enterprises began to reduce costs, overcome waste, and practice thrift, they have achieved significant results. According to the statistics of eight companies and manufacturing plants in three months alone, they have accumulated wealth for the people's motherland - saving more than 700,000 jin of millet. Since the Taiyuan Municipal Light and Heavy Industry Management Office issued a call for production savings in August, especially after the provincial government announced its decision on practicing streamlining and thrift, it has aroused great attention among all employees of public enterprises. They have universally carried out in-depth mobilization, organized themselves, formulated plans, researched saving methods, and earnestly implemented them, taking production savings as one of the important methods to restore and develop production and accumulate wealth. Because the workers have basically established a sense of ownership and a new attitude towards labor, they have a correct understanding of saving work, and have created many good saving methods in production. The Electric Power Company has extensively collected and utilized waste materials to save new materials. Employees of Limin Chemical Company, Industrial Chemical Company, Cement Plant, Match Company, Leather Factory, and Printing Company have launched a saving movement to improve production efficiency and reduce costs; each department has formulated its own saving plans and methods according to specific circumstances, and the workers have unanimously proposed: not only produce a large quantity, but also ensure high product quality. At the same time, labor discipline, saving records, and attendance systems have been established to ensure the smooth progress of saving. In order to promote the development of the saving movement, the Electric Power Company and Tobacco Company have created award banners for saving models; the Cement Plant, Match Company, and Limin Chemical Company have used blackboard newspapers to commend the saving deeds and achievements of employees in a timely manner. The leaders of various enterprises have a relatively clear understanding of relying on the working class, coupled with the close cooperation of party, government, and trade union cadres in their work, as well as the leading role of party members, Youth League members, and trade union members, thus enabling savings to achieve great results. The Electric Power Company alone saved 536,796 jin of millet in nearly three months due to repairing boilers and improving combustion methods; Comrade Liu Wei of the Electric Motor Factory improved the screw-turning machine, which doubled production efficiency; Guo Weihan, a foreman of the Tobacco Company, created a method of dyeing without caustic soda and paid attention to saving raw materials, saving more than 47,000 jin of millet in September alone; the employees of the Leather Factory saved nearly 27,000 jin of rice in August and September due to fine material selection and reduced consumption; the Industrial Chemical Company saved more than 25,000 jin of rice per month only by saving electricity and paying attention to feeding; the Cement Plant changed the use of detonating cord to self-made artillery＠①, saving oil, coal, electricity, stationery and labor, saving more than 30,000 jin of millet in September alone; the Printing Company saved more than 20,000 jin of rice in expenses in just two and a half months from September to mid-October; the Limin Chemical Company saved nearly 20,000 jin of rice in fuel and electricity costs. The above achievements have laid a solid foundation for future production savings in various factories, and a number of saving models have emerged in the process of saving, promoting the progress of the saving movement. Some workers, recognizing the great significance of saving and changing their labor attitude, for example, Li Jinyu, a cigarette worker in the Tobacco Company, was lazy and mischievous in the past, but due to the improvement of class consciousness, he won the first-class saving model in saving. At present, among the employees of various factories, opposing waste and advocating saving has gradually become a movement.

　　太原八个公营企业
    克服浪费减低成本三个月节米七十万斤
    【本报讯】太原市各公营企业，为减低成本，克服浪费，厉行节约以来，已获重大成绩。仅据八个公司与制造厂三个月的统计，即为人民祖国积累财富——节约小米达七十余万斤。自八月份并市轻重工业管理处发出生产节约号召后，特别是省府公布了关于厉行精简节约决定以来，引起了各公营企业全体职工们的极大注意。曾普遍进行深入动员。实行组织起来，订出计划，并研究了节约办法，认真执行，把生产节约的工作作为恢复与发展生产，积累财富的重要方法之一。由于职工们基本上树立起了主人翁的思想与新的劳动态度，因而对节约工作有了正确的认识，且在生产中创造了许多有关节约的好办法。电力公司曾广泛进行了收集与利用废料，节省新料。利民化学公司、工业化学公司、洋灰厂、火柴公司、皮革厂与印刷公司的职工们，曾展开：提高生产效率，减低成本的节约运动；各部门根据具体情况，曾制订了自己的节约计划与办法，工友们一致提出：不但生产数量多，而且保证产品质量高。同时，并订出了劳动纪律，节约记录与考勤制度等，以保证节约的顺利进行。电力公司与烟草公司为推动节约运动的开展，曾为节约模范制下了奖旗；洋灰厂、火柴公司与利民化学公司，曾把职工们的节约事迹与成绩，通过黑板报及时进行表扬。各企业领导上由于对依靠工人阶级的思想比较明确，加之党、政、工等干部，在工作上的密切配合，以及党员、青年团员与工会会员的骨干带头作用，因而使节约获得了很大成绩。仅电力公司因修理锅炉，改进燃烧方法等项，在近三个月内即节省小米五十三万六千七百九十六斤；电机厂的刘伟同志，因改善了旋螺丝的机器，曾使生产效率提高了一倍；烟草公司工长郭维翰，创造了染色不用苛性曹达法，并注意节省原料，仅九月份即节省小米达四万七千余斤；皮革厂的职工，由于选料精细与减少消耗，八、九两月份节省米近二万七千斤；工业化学公司仅节省用电、注意下料两项，每月可节省米二万五千余斤；洋灰厂把用导火线改用自造炮＠①，节省油类、煤炭、电力、文具及人工等，九月份即节省小米三万余斤；印刷公司仅九至十月半的两个半月内，即节省开支米二万余斤；利民化学公司节省燃料及电费米近二万斤。以上成绩均给今后各厂生产节约打下了坚实基础，并在节约进行中涌现出不少的节约模范，推动了节约运动的进展。更有些工友，因认识了节约的伟大意义，转变了劳动态度，例如烟草公司卷烟工友李金玉，已往生产懒偷俏皮，由于阶级觉悟的提高，在节约中曾获得了甲等节约模范。目前在各厂职工中，对反对浪费，提倡节约已逐渐成为一种运动。
