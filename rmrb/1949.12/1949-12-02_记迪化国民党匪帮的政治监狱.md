　　A Record of the Kuomintang Bandit Gang's Political Prison in Dihua
    Guan Junfang
    Five days after the People's Liberation Army arrived in Dihua, this reporter accompanied Hu Jian, regimental commander of the 5th Tank Regiment of the People's Liberation Army, and some of his comrades to visit the prison where the bandit Sheng Shicai had imprisoned them for four years. Cell No. 9 was where Commander Hu was imprisoned for a year and a half. It was a dark, damp, pigeon-coop-like little room, adjacent to the toilet. Commander Hu painfully recalled the blood debts of the Kuomintang bandit gang and the executioner Sheng Shicai for killing patriotic compatriots here for more than ten years.

    He said: As early as the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, many outstanding Communist Party members and patriotic people, with great enthusiasm, crossed the Qilian Mountains and the Gobi Desert to reach the frontier of the motherland, actively engaging in anti-Japanese propaganda and local construction. The bandit Sheng Shicai, deeply afraid that the people's strength would grow and shake his evil dictatorial rule, colluded with the Kuomintang bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek to carry out bloody terror against the Communists and patriotic people in Xinjiang. They built ten major prisons in Dihua, imprisoning countless patriotic compatriots of all ethnic groups. The bandits even threw into prison wounded and blinded Eighth Route Army soldiers who were heroically wounded in the Battle of Pingxingguan and were recuperating in Xinjiang, as well as the more than seventy-year-old mother and wife of the Communist Party member Su Zhaozheng, who had already sacrificed himself, and the descendants of Communist Party members, from infants of a few months to children of a few years old.

    Pointing to the room where he was imprisoned for a year and a half, Commander Hu Jian said that Comrade Chen Tanqiu, the person in charge of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang, had also lived in this room. Chen Tanqiu was a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He suffered all kinds of torture in prison, always persevered, and was later taken away, and there has been no news of him since. At the same time, Communist Party member Mao Zemin (brother of Chairman Mao), the director of the Xinjiang Finance Department, and Lin Zhilu, the dean of the Xinjiang College, also suffered various tortures here and finally heroically gave their lives.

    Recalling the situation in prison that year, Commander Hu Jian said with excitement: Our soldiers in prison never stopped fighting and studying. The comrades transformed the court into a platform and the prison into a school. Under the leadership of the temporary branch of the Communist Party in the prison, they persisted in carrying out various struggles against the enemy and organized comrades to study Marxist-Leninist theory. The comrades dug small holes between the prison cells to communicate with each other, and pasted documents and study materials on the bottom of the latrine board when going to the toilet to pass them back and forth for reading. Whenever the sun went down, everyone sang the tragic prisoner's song and the heroic March of the Volunteers, and often recited Dimitrov's famous saying: "Iron window flavor, simple meal home cooking, beheading and shooting, retire and return home," to encourage each other. Once, after everyone had been on a hunger strike for seven days, the bandits actually mixed chili powder with milk and injected it into the abdomens of the hunger strikers through the anus. But these inhuman tortures never made a single comrade yield. On the first day of the Japanese surrender, Commander Hu Jian was taken to the interrogation room. The bandits took turns conducting fatigue interrogations. Throughout the night, he only repeated one sentence, "I believe in Marxism-Leninism and vow to fight to the end for communism." At dawn, the bandits forced him to sign a statement of betrayal. As a result, he still signed the words he had repeatedly said on the blank paper. Commander Hu was finally carried back to cell No. 9 after suffering severe torture. The comrades in the prison regarded all the torture as a good test and learning opportunity.

    Finally, everyone walked to the Black Cell, a prison cell where no light could penetrate all year round. There were three rooms in a row, front and back. Commander Hu pointed to the last room and said that it was where Ma Zhu, the former editor of the Xinjiang Daily, had been imprisoned for two years. At first, the enemy set up a banquet to induce him to surrender. Ma Zhu kicked over the table and denounced the bandits' shamelessness, so he was sent to the Black Cell for two years. Comrade Ma had not seen the light of day for a long time in the dark and humid Black Cell, and his eyes gradually became blind. The comrades in the other cells tried to buy some oil wax and send it in, so that he could regain a little light.

    After seeing all kinds of prisons, everyone took a deep breath. No matter how cruel the reactionaries were at the time, today the reactionary rule in Xinjiang and all of China has finally been overthrown by the people. The martyrs who sacrificed in the prisons of the reactionaries will be immortal.

　　记迪化国民党匪帮的政治监狱
    关君放
    人民解放军到达迪化的第五天，记者曾随同人民解放军战车第五团胡鉴团长以及他的一些战友们参观了盛世才匪徒曾经监禁他们达四年之久的监牢。第九号监牢是囚禁胡团长达一年半的地方。这是一个阴暗潮湿象鸽笼似的小房间，它和厕所比邻。胡团长沉痛地追述国民党匪帮和刽子手盛世才十余年来在这里杀害爱国同胞的血债。
    他说：远在抗战之初，不少优秀的共产党员和爱国人士抱着极大的热情，超过祁连山，横跨戈壁沙漠，到达祖国的边疆，积极从事抗战宣传和地方建设工作。匪徒盛世才深恐人民力量壮大，动摇他的罪恶的独裁统治，乃勾结国民党匪首蒋介石对新疆的共产党人和爱国人士实行血腥的恐怖。他们在迪化修筑了十大监狱，监禁了各民族无数的爱国同胞。匪徒们甚至把在平型关战斗中英勇负伤双目失明在新疆休养的八路军战士和早已牺牲的共产党员苏兆徵的七十多岁的母亲和他的妻子，以及共产党员的后代，从几个月到几岁的小孩，都一起投入狱中。
    胡鉴团长指着他被囚禁一年半的房子说，中国共产党新疆负责人陈潭秋同志也住过这个房子。陈潭秋是中国共产党中央委员，在狱中受尽了各种酷刑，始终坚持不屈，后来被带走了，从此无消息。与此同时，共产党员新疆财政厅长毛泽民（毛主席之弟）、新疆学院教务长林志路也在这里受过各种刑罚，最后英勇就义。
    胡鉴团长回忆起当年狱中的情形激动地说：我们的战士在监牢里从未停止过斗争和学习，战友们变法庭为讲台，变监狱为学校，在监狱中的共产党临时支部领导下，坚持与敌人进行各种斗争，并组织同志学习马列主义理论。同志们在牢房与牢房间挖了小孔互通声息，把文件和学习材料在上厕所时。帖于茅坑板底，来回传递阅读。每当太阳落山的时候，大家就唱着悲壮的囚徒歌和雄壮的义勇军进行曲，并经常背诵季米特洛夫的名言：“铁窗风味、便饭家常，砍头枪毙、告老还乡”，借此相互激励。有一次在大家绝食七天之后，匪徒们竟用辣子粉拌牛奶由肛门中注入绝食者的腹中。但这些惨绝人寰的毒刑始终不曾使一个同志屈服。在日寇投降的第一天，胡鉴团长曾被带到审讯室，匪徒们轮流进行疲劳审讯，一夜中他只重复说着一句话，“我信仰马列主义，誓为共产主义奋斗到底。”天明时匪徒们逼着他签字叛变，结果他签在白纸上的仍旧是他反复所说的几个字。胡团长饱受毒刑后终于又抬回第九号监狱。狱中的同志把一切折磨当做很好的考验和学习。
    最后大家走到了黑号监狱，那是终年一丝光线也透不进去的囚房，一排房屋前后三间，胡团长指着最后一间说，那是前新疆日报编辑马珠囚禁过两年的地方。当初敌人大摆酒席诱他投降，马珠一脚踢翻桌子，痛斥匪徒的无耻下流，因此下了两年黑狱。马同志在阴湿的黑狱中长久不见天日，眼睛逐渐失明，其他牢里的同志设法买点油腊送进去，好容易才使他重新得到一点光明。
    看完了各种各样的监狱之后，大家深深地吐了一口气，尽管反动派当时怎样的凶残，而今新疆和全中国的反动统治终于被人民推翻了，牺牲在反动派牢狱中的烈士们，永垂不朽。
