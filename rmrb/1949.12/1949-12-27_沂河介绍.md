Introduction to the Yi River
　　The Yi River originates from the western foothills of Mount Yi in Yishui County, Shandong. It flows south through Linyi and Tancheng, and enters Jiangsu Province from Qicun in Xin'an County. It runs parallel to the Central Canal southward to Wuhua Bridge in Suqian, where it turns east, known as the Liutang River. It flows southeast to Dashidu in Huaiyin County, where it splits into two branches, called the South and North Liutang Rivers. Crossing the Yan River, it is renamed the Wuzhang and Longgou Rivers, converging into the Guan River and flowing into the sea, with a total length of 574 kilometers. The source is 510 meters high. The upper reaches of the river have a steep gradient, and the water flow carries silt. After reaching northern Jiangsu, the terrain is low and flat, and the silt is deposited, causing the main stream to be silted up, and most of the water flows from the tributaries north of Suqian into the Central Canal. However, due to the siltation of the Luoma Lake reservoir in the upper reaches and the collapse of many diversion dams, the discharge of water is not smooth. Therefore, the Yi River is prone to flooding during the flood season. The Central Canal flows south to Suqian and connects with the Yi River again. When the water rises, the Yangtze River water flows into the Liutang River and out to sea, but the discharge capacity of the Liutang River is small, and the canal is also prone to flooding. North of the Liutang River, the Yi River branches off to the east, called the Shajiang River, which flows south to Shuyang and meets the Shu River. It then flows north, called the Guantian River and the Gang River, and meets the Qiangwei River. The Shajiang River is a connecting waterway between the Yi and Shu Rivers. When the Yi River rises, the water flows east into the Shu River through the Shajiang River, and when the Shu River rises, the water flows west into the Yi River through the Shajiang River. When both rivers rise, the Shajiang River overflows and causes flooding. The Liutang River discharges part of the water from the Central Canal, and when the Huai River rises, the water from its tributary, the Zhangfu River, also overflows into the Liutang River from the Yan River, making the Liutang River a confluence of the Yi, Shu, Huai, and Canal Rivers. The riverbed is highly silted, and the area it flows through suffers from flooding almost every year. In addition, for more than a decade, the Japanese puppet and Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the area along the river, engaging in corruption and evil deeds, embezzling public funds for water management, arbitrarily destroying embankments, and blocking rivers and dams, helping the water to wreak havoc, resulting in floods every year. After liberation, despite many repairs, the damage was too severe, and this year it still suffered from the breach of the Central Canal, with more than 17 million mu of fertile land flooded, accounting for more than one-third of the cultivated land in northern Jiangsu. With the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people in northern Jiangsu to rescue the situation, there were still 6 to 7 million mu without harvest, with an estimated loss of more than 1 billion jin of grain. After the new Yi River estuary to the sea is dug, it can not only eliminate the threat of flooding for residents along the coast, but also eliminate the threat of flooding below the Central Canal, and it is estimated that it can increase the harvest by 500 million jin of grain every year.

　　沂河介绍
    沂河发源于山东沂水县西北沂山西麓。南流经临沂、郯城，从新安县齐村流入江苏省境，与中运河并行南下至宿迁五花桥折向东行，称六塘河，东南行至淮阴县大石渡分为两支，称南、北六塘河。越盐河改称武漳、龙沟河，汇流入灌河出海，全长五百七十四公里。源高五百一十公尺。上流河身倾斜很大，水流夹带泥沙，至苏北后，地势低平，泥沙沉淀，因而使正干淤塞，水流多由宿迁以北支流泄入中运河。但由于上流蓄水池骆马湖被淤平，入运络坝亦多倾圯，泄水不畅。故在洪水期间沂必成灾。中运河流至宿迁以南又与沂河相通，水涨时江水流入六塘河出海，但六塘河泄水量少，运河亦复成灾。沂河在六塘河以北，分出一支东流，称沙礓河，流至沭阳以南与沭河相会。又北行称官田河、港河，与蔷薇河相会。沙礓河，为沂沭两河联络水道，沂涨由沙礓河东流入沭，沭涨由沙礓河西流入沂，二流俱涨，沙礓河即漫溢成灾。六塘河既泄中运河水流一部，淮水涨时其支流张福河之水亦由盐河旁溢入六塘，则六塘河成沂、沭、淮、运四流汇流之所。河身高淤，流经地域几无年不受其泛滥之苦。加以十余年来日伪蒋匪盘踞沿线，贪污作恶，侵吞治水公款，任意破坏堤防，堵河塞坝，助水为虐，以致洪水年年为患。解放后，虽经多方修整，无奈破坏过剧，今年仍受中运河决堤之灾，被淹良田一千七百多万亩，占苏北耕地面积三分之一强。在苏北党政军民奋力抢救下，仍有六、七百万亩毫无收成，估计损失粮食约十亿斤以上。沂河新入海道挖成后，既可免除沿岸居民水患，中运河以下水灾威胁也可免除，估计每年即能多收五亿斤食粮。
