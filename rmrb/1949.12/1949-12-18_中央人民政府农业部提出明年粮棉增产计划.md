Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: Following days of listening to reports on the general agricultural production situation in various regions and reports from experts, the National Agricultural Production Conference received a grain and cotton production increase plan for 1950 from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on the 15th, calling for a nationwide increase of 10 billion jin of grain and 1.3 billion jin of cotton. Luo Yuchuan, Vice Minister of Agriculture, provided the following explanation of the plan, stating: The guiding principle for agricultural production in 1950 is to focus on restoring production. The national agricultural production level has generally declined by about one-fourth compared to before the Anti-Japanese War, with some newly liberated areas even experiencing a reduction of about one-third. After several years of production campaigns in the old liberated areas, individual regions have restored or even exceeded pre-war levels, but generally remain lower than the pre-war average by more than 14 percent. Due to differences in the level of awareness of the peasant masses, working conditions, and economic environment between the new and old areas, the requirements for the degree of agricultural production recovery in different regions next year also differ. The plan requires that agricultural production in the old areas next year should increase by 10 percent compared to 1949; old areas with better production conditions should strive to restore pre-war production levels; even areas with more difficulties such as water and drought disasters must appropriately increase production. The plan requires that the general areas of the new liberated areas maintain the 1949 production level; areas with better conditions should strive for slight increases; disaster areas are required to overcome water and drought disasters. Vice Minister Luo continued, because it is necessary to ensure military and civilian food supplies and industrial raw materials, increasing food and cotton production is the central task of the nationwide agricultural production movement next year. The specific requirements are a nationwide increase of 10 billion jin of grain (compared to the 1949 grain output); planting 50 million mu of cotton, producing 1.3 billion jin of ginned cotton. The allocation to each region is: Grain: Northeast region to increase by 2.4 billion jin, North China region by 2.5 billion jin, old areas of East China by 1.9 billion jin, Henan Province by 650 million jin, old areas of Northwest by 50 million jin, new areas of East China by 1.3 billion jin, Central South region by 1 billion jin, new areas of Northwest by 280 million jin. Cotton: Northeast region to plant 3.3 million mu of cotton, North China region 18 million mu, Northwest region 3.88 million mu, East China region 15.2 million mu, Central China region 10.27 million mu. In order to ensure the completion of this production increase task, it is necessary to extensively mobilize and organize the labor force to restore and improve the level of cultivation, breed draught animals and livestock, build water conservancy projects, increase fertilizer application, prevent and control diseases and pests, promote superior varieties, increase agricultural implements, reclaim wasteland to expand cultivated land area, and actively carry out agricultural science experiments and research. Finally, Vice Minister Luo pointed out: This preliminary production increase plan was formulated in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, based on the existing data of the Ministry of Agriculture and the materials brought by representatives from various places, after repeated research and discussion. This plan has been approved by the Financial and Economic Committee. However, because the materials are not yet sufficient, and the nationwide relatively planned agricultural production is being implemented for the first time, local areas are required to further study it in detail.

　　中央人民政府农业部提出明年粮棉增产计划
    【新华社北京十七日电】全国农业生产会议于连日听取各区农业生产概况的报告，和各专家的报告后，十五日中央人民政府农业部向会议提出了一九五零年全国增产粮食一百亿斤和生产棉十三亿斤的粮棉增产计划。农业部罗玉川副部长对计划作了如下的说明，他说：一九五零年农业生产的方针，是以恢复生产为主。现在全国农业生产水平一般较抗日战争以前下降约四分之一，某些新解放地区甚至降低到三分之一左右。老解放区经过几年来的生产运动，个别地区也有已经恢复或超过战前水平的，但一般仍较战前平均低百分之十四以上。由于新区、老区农民群众的觉悟程度、工作条件和经济环境均不相同，所以对不同地区明年农业生产恢复程度的要求也不同。计划对老区明年的农业生产，要求应比一九四九年提高一成；生产条件较好的老区，应争取恢复战前的生产水平；就是有水、旱等灾害困难较多的地区，也须适当提高。计划对新解放区的一般的地区要求保持一九四九年的生产水平；条件较好地区争取略加提高；灾区则要求其战胜水旱等灾。罗副部长继指出：因为要保证军需民食及工业原料，所以食粮和棉花增产是明年全国农业大生产运动的中心任务。具体要求是全国增产粮食一百亿斤（与一九四九年粮食产量比较）；植棉五千万亩，产皮棉十三亿斤。各地区的分配是：粮食：东北区增产二十四亿斤，华北区二十五亿斤，华东老区十九亿斤，河南省六万五千万斤，西北老区五千万斤，华东新区十三亿斤，华中南区十亿斤，西北新区二亿八千万斤。棉花：东北区植棉三百三十万亩，华北区一千八百万亩，西北区三百八十八万亩，华东区一千五百二十万亩，华中区一千零二十七万亩。为了保证完成这一增产任务，应该大量发动和组织劳动力以恢复及提高耕作水平，繁殖耕畜家畜，兴修水利，增施肥料，防除病虫害，推广优良品种，增补农具，垦荒扩大耕地面积，并积极进行农业科学的试验研究工作。最后罗副部长指出：这个初步增产计划是遵照政务院财政经济委员会的指示，根据农业部现有资料和与会各地代表带来材料几经反复研究讨论拟订出来的。这个计划已经财政经济委员会批准。但因材料还不够充分，而全国的比较有计划的农业生产还是初次实施，因此要求各地更进一步地具体研讨。
