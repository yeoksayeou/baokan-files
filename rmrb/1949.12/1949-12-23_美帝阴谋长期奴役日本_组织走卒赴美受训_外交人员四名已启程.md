Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd—Simultaneous with the U.S. preparing to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, the U.S. government is stepping up its training of agents in Japan to serve as tools for long-term U.S. rule over Japan. According to the U.S. Information Service, this training program is very extensive. Those "invited" to the U.S. for training include more than 150 important figures from all walks of life, including Japanese diplomatic officials, police officials, members of the Diet, and labor, education, science, and news circles. According to a State Department announcement on the 19th, four of the twelve officials from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs who are to be trained in the U.S. have already departed for the U.S. The other personnel will depart for the U.S. in succession. The State Department also stated that these Japanese visits to the U.S. "were initiated by the State Department and the Department of the Army and are part of the U.S. government's National Leader Training Program." The U.S. State Department is currently organizing a sixty- to ninety-day training schedule for the upcoming Japanese "politicians," giving them the opportunity to study so-called American "democracy." In addition, under the auspices of MacArthur Headquarters, the Japanese Ministry of Education recently recruited and admitted 142 Japanese students to "study" in the United States. According to Agence France-Presse, Masataka Yoshida, the second son of the current Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and an employee of the Economic and Scientific Section of MacArthur Headquarters, and Yakichiro Suma, a former counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., are among those admitted.

　　美帝阴谋长期奴役日本
    组织走卒赴美受训
    外交人员四名已启程
    【新华社北京二十二日电】与美国准备单独缔结对日和约同时，美国政府正加紧训练其在日本的代理人，以便充当美国长期统治日本的工具。据美国新闻处讯，这项训练计划范围非常广泛。被“邀”前往美国受训的包括有日本外交官员、警察官员、国会议员及劳工、教育、科学、新闻等各界重要人物一百五十余名。据美国务院十九日宣布：日本外务省赴美受训之十二名官员中的四名，业已启程赴美。其他人员即将陆续赴美。国务院又称：此等日人之访美，“系由国务院与陆军部所发起，是美国政府的国家领袖训练计划的一部分”。美国国务院现正为即将到来的日本“政治家”组织六十至九十天的训练日程，使他们有机会研究所谓美国式的“民主政治”。此外，在麦克阿瑟总部的主持下，日本文部省最近招考录取日本学生一百四十二名赴美“学习”。据法新社称：日本现在首相吉田茂的次子、现任麦克阿瑟总部经济科学司职员的正冈和曾任日本驻华盛顿大使馆参事的须磨弥吉郎，均在录取之列。
