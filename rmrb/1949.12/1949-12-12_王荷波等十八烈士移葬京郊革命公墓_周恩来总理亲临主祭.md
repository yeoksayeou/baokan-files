　　Wang Hebo and Eighteen Other Martyrs Reburied in the Revolutionary Cemetery in the Suburbs of Beijing
　　Premier Zhou Enlai Presided Over the Memorial Ceremony
　　[Beijing News] Comrade Wang Hebo, a member of the Chinese Communist Party and a hero of the people's revolution, and eighteen other martyrs were brutally murdered in Beijing by the Feng faction warlords in November 1927. It has been twenty-two years since then. After the liberation of Beijing, their remains were located after extensive investigation. To commemorate the heroic deeds of the martyrs and to make them known to future generations, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions organized the "Wang Hebo and Eighteen Other Martyrs Reburial Committee." Yesterday (the 11th), the remains of the martyrs were reburied in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in the western suburbs. More than 300 people attended, including representatives from central and municipal units, and family members of the martyrs. The reburial ceremony began with a solemn memorial service, presided over by Premier Zhou Enlai. Those accompanying the ceremony included: Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Ren, Director of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The memorial service began at 2 p.m. with mournful music. After Premier Zhou's speech, Comrade Li Lisan reported on the deeds of the martyrs. He said: Comrade Wang Hebo can be said to be the oldest comrade from the working class in the Chinese Communist Party, and he has consistently stood on the correct path. Then, Comrade Wang Kai, a family member of the martyrs, delivered a reply speech. He said excitedly: "When we retrieved the bodies, we realized that it was only because the Communist Party and the Chinese people had occupied Beijing that the eighteen martyrs were able to be exonerated!" After the memorial service, the transfer of the remains and burial began. Led by military music, Premier Zhou and those accompanying the ceremony, along with the family members of the martyrs, carried the coffins. Representatives holding wreaths followed, leaving the auditorium filled with elegiac couplets and wreaths, and proceeded to the cemetery. After the remains of the martyrs were placed in the ground, Premier Zhou, Li Lisan, and others, along with the family members of the martyrs, personally covered them with soil. In the winter sunshine, the martyrs who had sacrificed themselves twenty-two years ago rested in peace.
