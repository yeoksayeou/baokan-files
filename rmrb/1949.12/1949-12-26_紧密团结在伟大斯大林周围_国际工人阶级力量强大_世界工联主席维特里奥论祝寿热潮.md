　　Closely Unite Around the Great Stalin
　  The International Working Class is Powerful
    World Federation of Trade Unions President Giuseppe Di Vittorio on the Birthday Celebration Craze
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th] TASS Moscow, December 23rd: World Federation of Trade Unions President Giuseppe Di Vittorio, in an article titled "The World's Working Class Closely United Around the Great Stalin" in Labor News, stated: Stalin's 70th birthday has become a day for extensively mobilizing the strength of the international working class. The joy and enthusiasm with which the masses celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday particularly powerfully demonstrate an extremely important and historically significant fact: the working class – the most advanced class of human society – regards Comrade Stalin as their universally recognized leader, beloved by all nations across the five continents. The many glorious achievements initiated by the great Stalin have greatly strengthened the world's socialist camp. Its vanguard – the Soviet Union – has grown into an invincible force, becoming the center towards which hundreds of millions of people aspire. The People's Democratic countries and the Chinese people, who have achieved epoch-making victories, are advancing along with the Soviet Union. In all countries, the influence and organization of the working class have greatly increased, and the prestige and glory of their beloved leader, Stalin, have reached an unprecedented height. At a time when the American and British imperialists are shamelessly preparing for an anti-Soviet war, the unparalleled mobilization of the strength of hundreds of millions of men and women caused by the celebration of Stalin's 70th birthday is of profound political and educational significance. Let the international working class, all progressive humanity, close their ranks around their victorious leader, so as to use all means to prevent the warmongers from realizing their evil schemes. Let the warmongers hear this powerful roar of the people! Glory, honor, and long life to the great Stalin.

　　紧密团结在伟大斯大林周围
　  国际工人阶级力量强大
    世界工联主席维特里奥论祝寿热潮
    【新华社北京二十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科二址三日讯：世界工联主席维特里奥以“全世界工人阶级紧密团结在伟大的斯大林周围”为题，在劳动报上著文称：斯大林的七十寿辰，已经成为广泛动员国际工人阶级的力量的日子。群众用以庆祝斯大林七十寿辰的那种欢欣与热情，特别有力地表明了一个极为重要而有历史意义的事实，即工人阶级——人类社会最先进的阶级，把斯大林同志当作是他们所公认的、受五洲万国所共同爱戴的领袖。伟大的斯大林所创始的许多光荣的业绩，大大地加强了世界的社会主义阵营。它的先锋队——苏联已经成长为强大无敌的力量，已经成为亿万人民向往的中心。各人民民主国家和获得了划时代胜利的中国人民，就正随着苏联迈进着。在所有的国家中，工人阶级的影响与组织已经大大地增长，他们所敬爱的领袖斯大林的威望与光荣，已经达到空前的高度。当此美英帝国主义者正在无耻地准备着反苏战争的时候，因庆祝斯大林七十寿辰而引起的亿万男女的力量的无比的动员，是具有深刻的政治上与教育上的意义的。国际工人阶级、一切进步人类，在他们的胜利领袖的周围，紧密他们的行列，以便用一切方法来使战争贩子们不能实现其罪恶图谋。让战争贩子们听听人民这一强大的吼声吧！光荣、荣耀与长寿归于伟大的斯大林。
