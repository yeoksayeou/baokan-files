　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th: According to the Polish Press Agency in Warsaw: The Polish United Workers' Party's organ, People's Tribune, commenting on the resolution of the Cominform meeting, stated: The Cominform meeting is a major international event because its resolution is a powerful weapon for the working-class movement in its struggle for progress, peace, and socialism. This movement is constantly expanding, and it will involve all nations.
    The newspaper continued: The Tito bandit gang, which is implementing a bloody fascist rule in Yugoslavia, has played the leading role of subversives, spies, and organizers of counter-revolutionary conspiracies in the people's democratic countries. The Polish working class and our party recognize the tasks put forward by the Cominform's resolution. Strengthening revolutionary vigilance means fully implementing the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, eradicating the remnants of right-wing nationalism, eliminating the remnants of social democracy and opportunism, exposing and expelling harmful elements, and strengthening ideological education in the party's work, and improving the party's working methods. Today, this action is guiding the entire life of our party and the Polish working class. The struggle for lasting peace means mobilizing the people of the whole country under the slogan of defending peace, completing the economic plan ahead of schedule, and accelerating the construction of the foundations of socialism, so as to further consolidate the camp of peace and progress united around the Soviet Union.

    波人民论坛报评论情报局决议
    【新华社北京五日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党机关报人民论坛报评论共产党与工人党情报局会议的决议称：情报局会议是重大的国际事件，因为它的决议是工人阶级运动争取进步、和平与社会主义的强有力的武器。这个运动正在不断地扩大，它将使一切民族卷入其中。
    该报继称：在南斯拉夫实行血腥的法西斯统治的铁托凶手匪帮，已充当了颠覆分子、间谍与人民民主国家中反革命阴谋的组织者的要角。波兰工人阶级及我们的党认识到情报局的决议所提出的任务。加强革命的警觉性，意味着完全执行波兰统一工人党第三次中央全会的决议，根绝右翼民族主义倾向的残余，消灭社会民主主义和机会主义的残余，揭露和驱逐有害分子，在党的工作中加强思想教育，改进党的工作方法。今天，这一行动正指导着我们的党和波兰工人阶级的整个生活。争取持久和平的斗争，意味着在保卫和平的口号下，动员全国人民，提前完成经济计划，加速建设社会主义的基础，以此来进一步巩固团结在苏联周围的和平与进步阵营。
