　　At the UN General Assembly's Political Committee

　　The US-British Bloc is in a Predicament
　　Daring Not to Publicly Support the Slanderous Nonsense of the Remnant Bandit Representatives
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th: TASS, New York: At the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meetings on December 1st and 2nd, the representatives of the US-British bloc attempted to find a way out of their predicament by using the anti-Soviet slanders made by the Kuomintang representatives in the Political Committee. Even the American patrons of the Kuomintang, although they attacked the Soviet Union, did not dare to come out and support the slanderous accusations made by the representatives of the Kuomintang group that had been spurned by the Chinese people. After jointly submitting a proposal with Australia, Mexico, Pakistan, and the Philippines that was much more tactfully worded than the Kuomintang proposal, the US representative made it clear that they had decided to retreat and abandon their further support for the Kuomintang's slander.

　　At the meeting on the 1st, the Kuomintang representatives had tried in vain to win the support of the members of the Political Committee. The Kuomintang representatives demanded that the Political Committee not reject but accept the Kuomintang's proposal, demanding that it be passed together with the five-nation proposal submitted by the US delegation.

　　However, everyone turned a deaf ear to the demands of the Kuomintang representatives. The Mexican representative said that he was unwilling to support the Kuomintang's proposal. The Haitian representative said that no one should underestimate the power of facts in international relations. Representatives of Pakistan and Chile opposed those arguments in the Kuomintang proposal that attempted to prevent UN member states from recognizing the government of the People's Republic of China. New Zealand representative Berendsen admitted that the US-British bloc could do nothing more than express "sympathy and understanding." Berendsen strongly advocated "openly and honestly" admitting that passing the Kuomintang's slanderous proposal would only mean "washing one's hands of the whole affair." British representative Shaun said that the British delegation would vote against the Kuomintang's proposal. But he also said that this did not mean that the British delegation did not sympathize with the accusations made by the Kuomintang representatives. The British representative said that he also opposed passing both the Kuomintang proposal and the five-nation proposal together.

　　At the request of the Kuomintang representatives, the discussion of the proposal was postponed to continue on the 5th.

　　Note: The UN General Assembly's Political Committee had previously discussed the so-called "accusation" against the Soviet Union by the Kuomintang bandit gang on November 28. The US representative Jessup had proposed the so-called joint proposal of the United States, Australia, the Philippines, Mexico, and Pakistan to replace the Kuomintang bandit gang's "accusation against the Soviet Union" proposal, which even the United States found difficult to pass.

### 联大政治委员会上　美英集团身处困境  不敢公开支持残匪代表诽谤谰言

　　联大政治委员会上
  　美英集团身处困境
    不敢公开支持残匪代表诽谤谰言
    【新华社北京五日电】据塔斯社纽约电：在十二月一日及二日的联合国大会政治委员会会议上，美英集团的代表力图从国民党代表在政治委员会上所发表的反苏谰言使他们身处的困境中找寻出路。甚至国民党的美国恩主，他们虽然攻击苏联，但也不敢出来支持被中国人民所唾弃的国民党集团的代表所提出的诽谤控诉。美国代表在与澳大利亚、墨西哥、巴基斯坦及菲律宾联合提出比国民党提案的措词婉转得多的提案之后，明白表示，他们已经决定撤退并且放弃他们对国民党谰言的进一步支持。
    在一日的会议上，国民党代表曾经徒然地企图博得政治委员会委员国的支持。国民党代表要求政委会不要否决而要接受国民党的提案，要求可以与美国代表团所提出的五国提案一起通过。
    然而，大家对国民党代表的要求却充耳不闻。墨西哥代表说：他不愿支持国民党的提案。海地代表说：任何人不应在国际关系上低估事实的力量。巴基斯坦与智利的代表，都反对国民党提案中那些力图使联合国会员国不承认中华人民共和国政府的论点。新西兰代表贝仑德逊承认：美英集团除了表示“同情与谅解”之外，不能再有其他作为。贝仑德逊力主“公开而诚实地”承认：通过国民党的谰言提案，只会意味着“袖手不管全盘事务”。英国代表肖恩说：英国代表团将投票反对国民党的提案。但又说：然而，这并不是说英国代表团不同情国民党代表所提出的控诉。英国代表说，他还反对一起通过国民党提案与五国提案两个决议。
    在国民党代表的要求之下，对该提案的讨论延至五日继续举行。
    按：联合国大会政治委员会前此曾于十一月二十八日一度讨论国民党匪帮的所谓“控诉”苏联提案。美国代表耶塞普曾在会上提出了所谓美、澳、菲、墨、巴（基斯坦）五国联合提案以代替连美国都感到难于通过的国民党匪帮“控诉苏联”的提案。
