Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 7th: Hong Kong dispatch: Spokespersons for the uprising employees of the China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation in Hong Kong recently issued a statement regarding Premier Zhou's statement concerning the two companies' assets in Hong Kong, as follows:

"The employees of the two airlines feel boundless excitement and encouragement upon reading Premier Zhou's statement from Beijing on the 3rd of December. We are determined to resolutely and thoroughly complete the task entrusted to us by the government of protecting equipment and assets.

Premier Zhou's statement pointed out: 'The assets of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong can only be handled by our Central People's Government and personnel entrusted by the Central People's Government. No infringement, movement, or damage by any means is permitted.' Since Liu Jingyi and Chen Zhuolin were respectively appointed as General Managers of CNAC and CATC by the Central People's Government, it is obvious that General Managers Liu and Chen are the personnel entrusted by our government to handle these matters. Unexpectedly, Shen Desie and Dai Anguo, impersonating the 'General Managers' of our two airlines, have attempted to move, damage, and sell our two airlines' assets through various means. This is precisely the illegal action that Premier Zhou's statement forbids. We believe that the Hong Kong government will understand this fact and take timely and effective measures to stop it, and respect and protect our sacred property rights.

We also heard that speculative merchants are attempting to collude with reactionary elements to steal and sell the people's property. We warn them to immediately abandon this illusion, lest they incur unfavorable consequences."

　　香港两航空公司起义员工发表谈话
  　坚决拥护周总理声明
    不许非法侵犯两公司留港资财
    【新华社广州七日电】香港讯：香港中国航空公司、中央航空公司起义员工发言人，顷就中央人民政府周总理日前所发表关于两公司在港资产之声明，发表谈话如下：
    “两航员工读到我中央人民政府周总理三日在京的声明，感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。政府所付予员工们的保护器材资产的任务，我们誓必坚决地、彻底地去完成。
    周总理的声明中指出：“两航公司留在香港的资财，只有我中央人民政府和中央人民政府所委托的人员，才有权处理，不容许任何以任何手段的侵犯、移动或损坏。”自刘敬宜、陈卓林受中央人民政府分别委任为中航、央航的总经理以来，刘、陈两总经理即为我政府委托处置的人，这是最显而易见的事实。不意竟有冒充我两航“总经理”的沈德燮和戴安国妄图以各种手段移动损害及盗卖我两航的资财，这正是周总理声明中所指的不容许的非法行动。我们相信香港政府一定能了解这事实并及时有效制止，而对我神圣的产权加以尊重和保护。
    又闻有投机商人妄图勾结反动分子盗卖人民的产业，我们警告他们要立刻放弃这种幻想，以免招致不良的后果。”
