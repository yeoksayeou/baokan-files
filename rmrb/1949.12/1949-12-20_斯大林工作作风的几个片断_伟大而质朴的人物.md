Excerpts from Stalin's Working Style
　　A Great and Simple Man

　　Yakovlev, a famous Soviet aircraft designer, wrote a book called "Life Memoirs." It describes Stalin's life and working style. Now, we excerpt a few segments to share with you:

　　In his personal life, Stalin was extraordinarily frugal in everything.

　　His clothing was very simple: Before the Soviet-German War, he usually wore a special gray military uniform. In fact, it was not a military uniform, but a well-fitting casual suit, with trousers also made of this gray material, and soft and comfortable leather shoes.

　　When talking, he would always pace gently in the hall. He listened to the other person speak, rarely interrupting, and would let them finish speaking.

　　At government agency meetings, people would often hand Stalin notes, and he would always read them, fold them carefully, and put them in his pocket.

　　He paid great attention to every such note.

　　Being conscientious was a prominent characteristic of Stalin.

　　Stalin was intolerant of superficial observations of problems. He was unforgiving towards those who, when discussing a problem, showed that they did not understand the essence of the issue, and would definitely give them sharp criticism.

　　For example, once when Stalin gave a certain responsible person a task, the person said: "Comrade Stalin, the deadline is too short, and this work is difficult."

　　Stalin replied: "We are talking about difficult things here. Precisely because the matter is difficult, we have asked you to come. You should better say what assistance you need to do this, and complete everything that should be done on time."

　　Stalin liked people to answer his questions without hesitation, directly, and accurately.

　　Sometimes Yakovlev found it difficult to immediately answer the questions he raised—not knowing whether Stalin would approve of the answer. Stalin saw this situation and solemnly said to Yakovlev: "Please just answer according to what you think. Don't try to say things that please me. Don't talk to me like that. If you try to guess my wishes when you speak, then our conversation will be of little benefit. Don't think that if what you say does not agree with my meaning, it will be bad. You are a specialist, and we talk to you not only to give you our instruction, but also so that we can receive your instruction."

　　When commenting on a leader who had been removed from his post, Stalin said: "What's wrong with him? The bad thing is that when answering a question, he first observes the expression on people's faces, trying to guess what kind of answer would not put him in an embarrassing situation, and how to say it to please people. Such a person will ruin things, even though he does not want to do bad things in his heart."

　　Once, Stalin said: "If you firmly believe that your opinion is correct, and can prove that it is correct, then you should not consider anyone's opinion at all, but act according to your own views and your conscience."

　　…………………………

　　Stalin's own work, and the work of those around him, were extraordinarily precise.

　　Once, Stalin summoned Yakovlev and gave Yakovlev an important task.

　　Stalin said to Yakovlev: "This matter is very urgent and must be completed quickly, so we have decided to entrust you with this matter. Do you need any help?"

　　Yakovlev replied: "I don't need any help, I have everything I need."

　　Stalin said: "Very good, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call and ask for help."

　　Yakovlev then thought of something: "Comrade Stalin, I have a request! But the problem is very small, perhaps not worth bothering you with!"

　　Stalin said: "Please speak."

　　Yakovlev then said: "When performing the task, I often have to go to various airports, but the factory's transportation is very bad. I need two 'MI' brand cars."

　　Stalin said: "Just two cars, nothing else?"

　　Yakovlev said: "Yes, nothing else. I have everything else there."

　　Yakovlev went straight back to the factory, and as soon as he arrived, the deputy director greeted him and said: "Comrade Yakovlev, just now a call came from the People's Commissariat of the Automobile Industry, asking us to send someone with a receipt to pick up two 'MI' brand cars." After forty minutes, two brand-new "MI" brand cars had already been driven to the factory.

　　A little over an hour later, Comrade Molotov's secretary called Yakovlev to ask if they had received the cars. This was originally to check on the implementation of the work.

　　——Stalin is the teacher of the world's human revolution, his life and working style are great and simple. Everyone should study Stalin's revolutionary theory and doctrine, and also study his life and working style.

### 斯大林工作作风的几个片断　伟大而质朴的人物

　　斯大林工作作风的几个片断
  　伟大而质朴的人物
    苏联有名的飞机制造家雅可福烈夫，写过一本书，叫做“生平回忆”。其中讲到斯大林的生活和工作作风，现在我们摘出几个片断来和各位讲一讲：
    斯大林在他个人生活方面，一切都是异常俭朴的。
    他的服装很朴素：在苏德战争以前，通常都是穿着一种特式灰色军装，其实，也并不是军装，而是很合身的便服，裤子也是用这种灰色材料制成，皮鞋绵软而轻便。
    在谈话的时候，他总是在厅里轻轻的踱着步。他听着对方说话，很少打断对方的讲话，一直让他讲完为止。
    在政府机关会议上，常有人递给斯大林纸条，而他每次都是把纸条看完，好好摺起来放在衣袋里。
    他对于每次这种纸条都是很注意的。
    认真办事是斯大林的显著特点。
    斯大林对于浮浅观察问题的态度是容忍不住的。对于那些在讨论一种问题时候表示不明问题实质的人，毫不宽恕，一定要给他以锋利的批评。
    比如有一次斯大林给某负责人员一种任务的时候，那人说道：“斯大林同志，期限太短了，这工作是困难的。”
    斯大林回答道：“我们这里所谈的都是困难事情。正因为事情困难，所以才请您来。您最好说说作这件事需要什么帮助，并且把应该作的一切都按时完成。”
    斯大林喜欢人毫不犹豫地、直接了当地、确切地回答他的问题。
    有时雅可福烈夫觉得难于马上回答他所提的问题——不知道斯大林是否赞成这个回答，斯大林看出了这种情形就郑重的对雅可福烈夫说道：“请您只照您所想的来回答就够了。不要努力说使我高兴的话。同我谈话不要这样。如果您要猜合我的心愿来讲话，那么我们的谈话就很少益处。您不要以为您说的话如果不合我的意思，就会不好。您是专门家，我们同您谈话不只是使您受到我们的教益，而且也便我们受到您的教益。”
    斯大林在评论一位被解除工作的领导人的时候说道：“他有什么坏处呢？坏处就是在回答某个问题时，首先就是察颜观色，极力猜度，需要怎样回答，才不致陷于窘境，怎样说才可以取悦于人。这样的人会大坏事情，虽然他本心不愿作坏事。”
    有一次，斯大林说：“如果您坚信自己的意见正确，并且能证明是正确的时候，那您就根本不要顾及任何人的意见，而是要本着您的见解和您的天良去行动。”
    …………………………
    斯大林本人的工作，和他周围人员的工作，都是异常精确的。
    有一次斯大林召雅可福烈夫去，给了雅可福烈夫一个重要任务。
    斯大林对雅可福烈夫说道：“这件事很紧急，要火速完成，所以我们决定把这件事委托您去作。您需要什么帮助吗？”
    雅可福烈夫答道：“什么帮助也不要，一切需要的东西我都有。”
    斯大林说：“很好，若是需要什么，您不要客气，尽可打电话来要求帮助。”
    雅可福烈夫当下想起一件事情：“斯大林同志，我有一个要求！不过问题很小，或许不值得烦劳您！”
    斯大林说：“请讲吧。”
    雅可福烈夫就说：“在执行任务的时候，要常常到各飞机场去，可是工厂的交通工具很不好。我需要两辆‘ＭＩ’牌汽车。”
    斯大林说：“只要两辆汽车，再不要什么吗？”
    雅可福烈夫说：“是的，再不要什么。别的一切我那里都有了。”
    雅可福烈夫一直回到工厂去，刚一到工厂的时候，副厂长就迎着说道：“雅可福烈夫同志，方才由汽车工业人民委员部打来电话，叫派人带着收据去领两辆‘ＭＩ’牌汽车。”经过四十分钟，两辆崭新的“ＭＩ”牌汽车已经开到工厂了。
    又过了一点钟的功夫，莫洛托夫同志的秘书给雅可福烈夫打来了电话，问他们是否领到了汽车。这原来是检查执行工作。
    ——斯大林是全世界人类革命的导师，他的生活和工作作风是伟大而又质朴的，大家学习斯大林的革命理论和学说，也要学习他的生活和工作的作风。
