Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th:

    Indonesian representative Lila Suripno's speech at the Asian Women's Representative Conference on the 12th is summarized below: Dear friends, comrades:
    I bring you the respect and sisterly love of the Democratic Women of Indonesia. On behalf of the women of democratic Indonesia, I especially thank the powerful Women's International Democratic Federation and the women of New China for enabling us to hold this first conference in the history of the Asian women's movement in Beijing, the capital of the new People's Republic of China.
    For many years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, have fought bravely and shed blood to build this new democratic fortress. In this struggle, they were encouraged by the victory of the Soviet Union and their beloved leader Comrade Stalin.
    I am proud and happy to stand on the land of New China and speak on behalf of the democratic women of East Java. They are fighting for genuine independence and to establish new women's organizations among the masses.
    Indonesia has always had a struggle for national independence. The history of Indonesia's independence movement tells us that Indonesian men and women are also engaged in political struggle side by side.
    When World War II broke out, the Netherlands was completely unable to resist the Japanese invasion of Indonesia. On March 8, 1942, Dutch troops and officials fled to Australia, leaving the unarmed Indonesian people to the Japanese fascists.
    After the war, the Netherlands returned with the help of British and American imperialists. The Indonesian people, who had been ravaged and treated as slaves for centuries, began to move for the first time in Indonesia's history. This fact is of great importance. Then guerrilla groups were born, and some families participated in the guerrillas in the mountains as a whole family. United with the regular army, these guerrillas avenged the Dutch army's atrocities of burning villages and massacring thousands of people with all the courage inspired by their loyalty to their young republic.
    But the Dutch and American imperialists found suitable people among the leaders of Indonesia. Sukarno and Hatta became puppets in the hands of the Dutch and American masters. On American orders, these two agreed to launch "an anti-communist offensive" in 1948, and many leaders of the National People's Front were arrested and executed.
    But despite all the agreements between the Dutch and American imperialists and the reactionary Hatta clique, the struggle for independence has become stronger and stronger.
    Relying on the masses and especially on the peasants, our guerrilla fighters work in the fields during the day. They are powerful because they live among the people in the countryside. Therefore, it is difficult for the Dutch to catch them. Because of our guerrilla fighters, the Dutch plantations are not completely safe, and many times after guerrilla attacks, the entire guard of these plantations followed the guerrillas.
    In this struggle for liberation, the women of Indonesia are fulfilling their responsibilities. Although our women were not born and raised in the army, they protect themselves and their children from the ravages of the enemy. In addition, democratic women have established organizations that are rooted in the masses. At the congress held in Yogyakarta in September 1949, the most important issue raised by progressive women was: to establish an independent, free, and democratic Indonesian state governed by and for the benefit of the Indonesian working people.
    The People's Republic of China, established under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and encouraged by the powerful Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, has given the Indonesian people a brilliant example of how to achieve victory. Only by forming a united front of all democratic forces in Indonesia with the Communist Party of Indonesia as the central leadership can we win victory in the war against the imperialist enemy. With the help of the world's democratic forces, especially with the help of the Dutch democratic workers, victory will surely belong to us.
    Dutch and American warmongers and their Indonesian puppets can reach agreements and hold meetings such as round table conferences to give Indonesia independence on paper. However, the Indonesian people must decide for themselves what their concept of freedom and true independence is, and they must fight for its realization.
    The Indonesian People's Liberation Movement must learn from the experience of the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution, and accept its lessons and work accordingly. Then the Indonesian people will finally have a day of victory, and women and children will have a bright future, developing themselves into liberated, happy new people.
    Long live the common struggle of Asian women and women in Western countries!

### 印度尼西亚代表索里普诺发言

    印度尼西亚代表索里普诺发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】印度尼西亚代表丽拉·索里普诺十二日在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言摘要如下：亲爱的朋友们、同志们：
    我给你们带来印度尼西亚民主妇女的敬意和亲如姐妹的热爱。我代表民主的印度尼西亚妇女，特别感谢强大的国际民主妇联和新中国的妇女，使得我们能够在北京，新的中华人民共和国的首都，举行这个亚洲妇女运动历史上第一次的会议。
    多少年来，中国人民为了建立这个新的民主的堡垒，在毛泽东同志的领导之下，英勇战斗和流血，他们在这个斗争中得到苏联的胜利和他们敬爱的领袖斯大林同志的鼓舞。
    我很骄傲和愉快地站在新中国的土地上，代表东爪哇的民主妇女发言。她们正在为争取真正的独立和在群众中建立新的妇女组织而进行斗争。
    印度尼西亚从来就存在着争取民族独立的斗争。印度尼西亚争取独立运动的历史告诉我们，印尼的男女也同样肩并肩地从事政治斗争。
    当第二次世界大战爆发的时候，荷兰完全不能抵抗日本之侵入印度尼西亚。而且在一九四二年三月八日，荷兰的军队与官员逃到澳大利亚，把没有武装的印尼人民丢在日本法西斯的手里。
    在大战以后，荷兰在英国和美国帝国主义者的援助下回来了。几世纪以来受到蹂躏并被作为奴隶对待的印度尼西亚人民开始动起来了，这是印度尼西亚有史以来的第一次。这一事实有着极大的重要性。接着游击队小组诞生了，并且有些家庭全家都参加了山上的游击队。与正规军团结在一起，这些游击队以对他们年青共和国的忠诚而鼓舞起来的全部勇敢，对荷兰军队的焚毁村庄和屠杀成千人的暴行进行复仇。
    但荷兰和美国帝国主义者从印度尼西亚的领袖中，找到了合用的人。苏加诺和哈达成为荷兰和美国主子手上的傀儡。按照美国人的命令，这两个人同意在一九四八年发动“一次反共攻势”，而全国人民阵线的许多领袖就被逮捕和处死了。
    但是尽管荷兰、美国帝国主义者与反动的哈达集团间有着一切协定，但争取独立的斗争却愈来愈强大了。
    依靠着群众并且特别是依靠着农民，我们的游击队战士白天就在田地里工作。他们是强有力的，因为他们生活在乡村的人民中间。因此，荷兰人是难于捉到他们的。因为有我们的游击队战士，荷兰的种植园就不是完全安全的了，并且有许多次在游击队的攻击后，这些种植园的全部卫队都跟着游击队走了。
    在争取解放的这一斗争中，印度尼西亚的妇女尽着她们的责任。虽然我们的妇女不是在军中诞生和长大的，但她们却保卫着自己和她们的孩子免受敌人残害。此外，民主的妇女已成立了在群众中生根的组织。一九四九年九月在日惹举行的代表大会中，进步妇女所提出的最重要的问题就是：建立为印度尼西亚劳动人民所治理并为其谋福利的一个独立、自由、民主的印度尼西亚国家。
    在毛泽东同志的领导和强大的苏联与斯大林同志的鼓舞之下建立起来中华人民共和国，这给与了我们印度尼西亚人民以获得胜利的光辉的范例。只有由印尼各民主力量结成以印尼共产党作中心领导的一条阵线，我们才能在反对帝国主义仇敌的战争中赢得胜利。由于世界民主力量的帮助，特别是由于荷兰民主工人的帮助，胜利决将属于我们。
    荷兰与美国的战争制造者及其印尼傀儡，可以达成协定并举行如圆桌会议之类的会议，在纸面上给印尼以独立。然而，印尼人民却一定要自行决定他们关于自由与真正独立的观念是什么，而且他们也一定要为其实现而斗争。
    印尼人民解放运动必须从俄国革命和中国革命经验中学习，并接受其教训而进行工作。然后印尼人民也会终于有获得胜利的一天，而妇女与儿童也会有一个光明的将来，使自己发展成获得解放的、幸福的新人。
    亚洲妇女和西方各国妇女的共同斗争万岁！
