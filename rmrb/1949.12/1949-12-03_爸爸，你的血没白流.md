　　Dad, Your Blood Was Not Shed in Vain
    Ma Minying, Second Division of the Affiliated High School of the Normal University

    Whenever I think of Dad, I become extraordinarily motivated. Especially Dad's lifelong perseverance and his spirit of striving for progress are things I can never forget.

    I love Dad. Dad was a steadfast, simple, thoughtful, and daring Communist Party member. I remember when he was doing underground work in Henan, he had to walk so many roads every day. Although his body was so weak, he never took a car. He would leave early in the morning and not return until late at night. After returning home, he would still read for an hour or two. He often taught me this: "Every second is extremely precious. A person who only wastes time and does not seek progress is simply a fertilizer-making machine."

    I should thank Dad. In an atmosphere of corruption, degeneration, treachery, hypocrisy, and shamelessness all around, he inspired me to resist oppression and pursue the light, and instilled in me a revolutionary will. When Dad had free time, he often told me how Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, oppressed and humiliated the Chinese people. He also told me that in the bloody history of the Chinese revolution, countless heroic revolutionaries had bravely sacrificed themselves to resist oppression, and the stories of their singing aloud and calmly going to their deaths on the execution ground. Therefore, in my mind, I developed boundless respect and admiration for these sacrificed heroes! I often thought to myself: I will also be a great person like this in the future, resisting oppression and unyielding to the death. I remember one night in February 1947, Dad said, "Ping'er! Do you know who Dad's enemies are?" I was baffled. I thought, how could Dad, such a good person, have enemies? Dad continued, "You are not young anymore, so be careful, go to the door to play less, and if anyone comes to look for someone in our family in the future, report it back... If I die one day, you must firmly remember to avenge me! Dad's enemies are the Kuomintang reactionaries. They drink our blood, drink our sweat, and kill countless of our people. But we have the people of the whole world, and they can't kill us all. One day, all the people will rise up and wipe out these man-eating beasts..." After hearing this, I was very worried about Dad. I wondered if Dad could win? What if there were no soldiers? But because of the correctness and decisiveness of what Dad usually did, I couldn't help but believe that Dad would win. No matter what, I would fight the Chiang bandit gang to the end.

    In November (or December) 1947, Dad left me. After he was arrested in Kaifeng in April, I only saw him once, and it was also the last time. Thinking about it now really breaks my heart. I remember that the time I went was in October. I sent Dad cotton shoes and cotton clothes. I was not allowed to enter the reception area. But, coincidentally, Dad was taking a walk in the yard. So, I was lucky enough to see him. His pale face and long hair and beard made me think that Dad had suffered thousands of hardships and was indeed much older. I stared blankly, but Dad smiled at me, and I couldn't help but burst into tears. Who knew that after just this one meeting, Dad was gone?! Now even Dad's remains are nowhere to be found.

    But today the revolution has been victorious, the people have become the masters, and we have established our own government. Dad: I'm telling you this good news: Chairman Mao has been elected Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China! I have joined the Youth League! I will join the Party in the future! Dad, your blood was not shed in vain. I will be as loyal to the Party's cause as you were, continue your unfinished business, and strive to build a new China, even if it means going through fire and water.

    May Dad rest in peace!
    Written for the second anniversary of Dad's death

　　爸爸，你的血没白流
    师大附中二部  马民英
    当我一想起了爸爸的时候，我就份外奋勉。特别是爸爸坚苦一生和他力求上进的精神，使我永远不能忘记。
    我爱爸爸。爸爸是个坚苦朴实，有思想、敢作敢为的共产党员。记得他在河南作地下工作的时候，每天都要跑好多路，虽然他的身体那样瘦弱，但他从来不坐车子，每天早晨出来，到夜深才回来，回家以后还要看一两个钟头书。他常常这样教育我：“一分一秒的时间，都是极其宝贵的。一个光浪费时间不求进步的人，那简直是造粪机器。”
    我应该感谢爸爸，他在那周围都是贪污、腐化、奸滑、虚伪和无耻的气氛下，启发了我反抗压迫和追求光明的思想，灌输给我革命的意志。爸爸在有空儿的时候，常常给我讲蒋匪介石及其主子美帝国主义是怎样压迫欺辱中国人民。他还给我说过，在中国革命的血史上，有无数的英勇革命者，为反抗压迫而壮烈的牺牲了，他们在刑场上慷慨高歌从容就义的故事。因此，在我的思想上，对于这些牺牲的英雄们起了无限的尊敬和爱慕！常常自己想着：将来也要做个这样伟大的人物，反抗压迫，至死不屈。记得在一九四七年二月间一天夜里，爸爸说：“平儿！爸爸的仇人你知道是谁吗？”我听了莫名其妙，我想爸爸这样好的人也会有仇人吗？爸爸接着说：“你也不小了，要留心点，少到门口玩，如果以后有人来找咱家的人，要回来报告一声……。假使有一天我要死了，你要牢牢的记住给我报仇！爸爸的仇人就是国民党反动派，它喝了我们的血，喝了我们的汗，还杀了我们无数的人。但是，我们有全世界的人民，他不能全杀了。总有一天所有的人都要起来，把他们这些吃人的野兽消灭掉……。”我听了以后，很为爸爸担心，我想爸爸能胜利吗？没有兵怎么办？但因为平常爸爸所做所为的正确和果断，使我又不能不相信爸爸会胜利。不管怎样罢，反正我要跟蒋匪帮干到底了。
    一九四七年十一月（或者是十二月），爸爸离我而去了，他四月间在开封被捕后，我只见过他一次，也是最后一次了。现在想起来真使我心疼。记得那一次我去的时候，正是十月天气，我给爸爸送棉鞋、棉衣。接见的地方不准我进去。可是，凑巧，爸爸正在院里散步。于是，我侥幸望见了他，他那苍白的面容和那长长的头发和胡子，使我想到爸爸受了千折万磨，确实苍老了许多。我呆呆的望着，爸爸却对我笑了笑，我不禁流下泪来。谁知道就在这么一次相见以后，爸爸就没有了呢？！如今就连爸爸的尸骨都不知下落。
    但是，今天革命胜利了，人民做了主人，我们已经建立了自己的政府。爸爸：我告诉你这个好消息：毛主席当选为中华人民共和国中央人民政府的主席啦！我加入了青年团！将来我还要入党哪！爸爸你的血没有白流，我一定象你一样尽忠于党的事业，继续你未竟之志，为建设新中国而奋斗，虽赴汤蹈火也是在所不惜的。
    愿爸爸在地下安息！
    为爸爸死难二周年而作
