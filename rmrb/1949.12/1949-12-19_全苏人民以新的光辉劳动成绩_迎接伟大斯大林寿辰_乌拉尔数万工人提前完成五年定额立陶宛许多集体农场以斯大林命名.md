Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports that the entire Soviet people are greeting Stalin's 70th birthday with new labor achievements. Factories and manufacturing plants across the country are reporting new and brilliant labor accomplishments won in the socialist emulation campaigns held to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, and the fulfillment of production guarantees. In the central Urals, tens of thousands of steelworkers, machine builders, and miners have already completed their five-year quotas ahead of schedule. Machine builders in Kharkov are reporting new and significant achievements. Several days ago, ten enterprises in the city completed their annual plans. In the Orel region, workers at 150 industrial enterprises have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule and are now producing goods according to the 1950 plan. Workers at factories and manufacturing plants in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, have been particularly enthusiastic in recent days. Workers at the Kiev Railway Depot completed their annual plan for locomotive repairs, and they will repair several locomotives above the plan as a gift to Stalin. Workers in the Donets Basin are adhering to a strict Stakhanovite timetable. The staff of the open-hearth furnace workshop at the Konstantinovka factory has completed the five-year plan in terms of total output. Advanced metallurgical workers in the Donets region have produced thousands of tons of steel in accordance with their obligations undertaken to celebrate Stalin's birthday.

Peasants in the villages of Lithuania are greeting Stalin's birthday by establishing new collective farms. Last month, over two hundred collective farms were organized throughout Lithuania; many of them are named after Stalin. There are now nearly six thousand collective farms in Lithuania. Workers at five state farms in the Stalin Oblast have completed the fourth quarter plan for tractor repairs ahead of schedule. Ukrainian peasants are also greeting Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday with new labor achievements. Collective farmers, workers at machine and tractor stations, and workers at state farms, after successfully completing the agricultural year, are now laying a solid foundation for next year's bumper harvest and for the further development of public livestock. Ukrainian mechanical workers have repaired one thousand three hundred more tractors than in the same period last year. Rural clubs, cultural centers, and reading rooms are holding exhibitions describing the great Stalin's multifaceted and effective activities for the welfare of the Soviet people, as well as the remarkable achievements of collective farmers. Young collective farms in the western region of Belarus are carrying out mass preparations for the spring sowing campaign to celebrate Stalin's birthday.

Messages from Soviet ships on the Pacific, Atlantic, Northern, and Indian Oceans report the labor victories of the sailors. In the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, off Sakhalin and Kamchatka, in the Baltic Sea and Azov Sea, and on the Danube River, sailors are working hard to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday.
