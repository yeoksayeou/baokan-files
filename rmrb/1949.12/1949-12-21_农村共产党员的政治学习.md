　　The Political Study of Rural Communist Party Members
　　Aomaluofu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Kazakhstan
　　We Bolsheviks have always unswervingly cared about the education of Communist Party members, about the improvement of their political understanding and the tempering of their minds.
　　On October 15th, the new school year in the Party's education system in rural areas began. The Party organizations of the republic had made many preparations in advance to enable rural Party members to study Marxism-Leninism effectively.
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Kazakhstan held a discussion meeting for propaganda workers in the republic, attended by 580 lecturers, official propagandists, and leading workers from the propaganda departments of district, municipal, and state committees.
　　In August and September, the preparation issues for the new school year had already been discussed in the meetings of Party grassroots organizations and in the plenary sessions of the district, municipal, and state committees of the Party of Kazakhstan.
　　The Party organizations paid great attention to cultivating and strengthening the ranks of propagandists. The ranks of propagandists are filled with the most qualified Communist Party members who can guarantee high-quality services. Approximately 13,000 propagandists have been selected and appointed in the republic, 9,000 of whom are in agricultural areas. The vast majority of them are leaders of Party and Soviet work groups and schools, and leaders of groups and schools of school teachers, engineers, and agricultural experts. The number of propagandists with higher education is gradually increasing.
　　The training courses established in accordance with the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) played a significant role in cultivating propagandists. Two thousand five hundred urban propagandists and one thousand five hundred and sixty rural propagandists studied in these training courses. Most of the listeners in the rural propagandist training courses were people from remote villages and pastoral areas.
　　For the leaders of groups and political schools who did not join the training courses, ten-day discussion meetings were held under the district committees according to a special plan. Lectures and reports were mainly given by Party workers and teachers from state central schools. About 7,000 rural propagandists participated in the discussion meetings.
　　The ideological content of the work in schools and groups depends not only on the theoretical cultivation of the propagandists but also on their ability to present the material to the audience. Therefore, in the work of discussion meetings and training courses, the issue of propaganda methods also occupies an important position. For example, in the training courses attached to the South Kazakhstan State Committee, the experiences of comrades Makitov and Musayev, the propagandists, were discussed in detail.
　　Of course, strengthening the education of propagandists cannot be limited to training courses. This requires Party organizations to always care about improving the theoretical level and propaganda skills of the propagandists.
　　Bolshevik propagandists are executing the Party's important mission: they must not only provide the audience with certain knowledge but also be political teachers to help Party members more deeply understand and resolutely implement the Party's policies and enhance their vanguard role in striving to complete economic plans. A propagandist who can successfully complete the tasks entrusted to him must have the following conditions: he himself must tirelessly study Marxist-Leninist theory and carefully study the domestic and foreign policies of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government.
　　As we all know, one of the most important and effective forms of helping propagandists is the regularly active discussion meeting attached to the Party's district committee. In many districts of the republic, the discussion meetings were unsystematic in the past, and due attention was not paid to methodological issues and the exchange of experiences, and the geographical dispersion of the districts was not often taken into account. As a result, many propagandists from remote collective farms and state-owned farms could not regularly participate in the business studies of the discussion meetings.
　　We have tried our best to overcome these shortcomings. Especially in geographically dispersed districts, discussion meetings were attached to village soviets and machine tractor stations. For rural propagandists in the most remote collective farms and pastoral areas, the system of going to the countryside for guidance will be widely used. At the same time, special supervision is being taken to ensure the necessary political, literary, and methodological reference books for these propagandists. The Tartukurgan State Committee had a good initiative: it cared about forming a small library for each propagandist.
　　Last year, the issue of individual access to Party members was not universally followed by us. And now, before determining that a Party member engages in a certain way of learning, individual conversations are conducted. This makes it possible for groups and political schools to organize listeners with more similar levels together. More than 150,000 rural Party members, tens of thousands of Youth League members, and non-Party activists are now engaged in political study. Approximately 4,000 groups studying the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), 3,800 political schools, and more than 1,000 groups studying the biographies of Lenin and Stalin have been established. In addition, there are 235 district Party night schools, whose students are mainly Party leaders, Soviet workers and economic workers, propagandists, teachers, and agricultural experts.
　　Great attention has also been paid to absorbing Party members working in pastoral areas to participate in political study. In most of the states with animal husbandry in the republic, the selection of leaders of red tents has been carefully considered and strengthened, and this job is always assigned to politically qualified Party members. At the same time, they are also responsible for leading political schools. For example, the Ili District Committee of Alma-Ata State organized four political schools in pastoral areas. In addition, general education schools are organized for Party members with low cultural levels under each red tent and primary school in pastoral areas.
　　During the preparation period for the new school year, such a method was adopted: that is, to guide as many activists in districts and villages as possible to independently study Marxist-Leninist theory.
　　The achievements of Party members in political self-study and the profound understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory are in many ways related to the quality of temporary instructors. Our qualified instructors are leading Party workers. For example, the instructors of the Burayevsky District in North Kazakhstan State are the secretary of the district committee, comrades Bao Yiqinko and Gaskoyev, and the members of the district committee. In order to help these instructors, we have organized regularly active discussion meetings.
　　The growing interest of Communist Party members in studying Marxist-Leninist theory urgently requires regular circular lectures in the district. We are experimenting with organizing future plans for oral and written lectures, preparing to use the strength of lecturers more rationally to organize lectures in the district and strengthen help to activists through written propaganda.
　　The Party's office is responsible for giving great help to propagandists and Party members. The work experience of the Party's office of the Shauridr District Committee in South Kazakhstan State is noteworthy. It unites the forces of the best lecturers and propagandists in the district around itself. The Party's office relies on the strength of activists to regularly check the quality of learning in groups and political schools. At the same time, it spreads the work experience of the best propagandists through newspapers, radio broadcasts, and with the help of guidance personnel going to the countryside, holds meetings to exchange experiences, and organizes mutual observation of propagandists.
　　One of the most important methods to improve the quality of Party education is newspapers. This year, newspapers in the republic and states have begun to publish theoretical and methodological articles more regularly, publishing guidance, answering readers' questions, and articles listing the publications of Lenin and Stalin's works. The work experience of propagandists in Party schools and groups has been well disseminated.
　　However, some serious shortcomings in newspaper propaganda have not been completely overcome. The theoretical articles published, especially the articles on propaganda methods, do not have a clear order. The problems of propagandists and Party members engaged in political self-study are not often studied, and popular lectures on current issues are rarely published to help young Party members.
　　The editorial department of the newspaper should formulate accurate plans to publish theoretical articles that cooperate with the learning materials in the Party's education network.
　　In the last plenary sessions of the state, municipal, and district committees, the way of learning for leading Party members of certain Party committees (Karagandy and East Kazakhstan State Committees) was sharply criticized. It was correctly pointed out that certain state, municipal, and district committees regard the leadership of the Party's education cause as a formalism to a certain extent and rarely supervise the quality of business in political schools and groups.
　　Following the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Party organizations of Kazakhstan are strengthening their role in all systems of Party education, ensuring a high level of business, and striving to improve the Marxist-Leninist education of Communist Party members.

　　农村共产党员的政治学习
    卡萨赫斯坦共产党（布）中央委员会书记  奥玛罗夫
    我们布尔塞维克党，始终不渝地关切着共产党员的教育，关切着他们政治认识的提高和思想的锻炼。
    十月十五日，农村地区党的教育系统中的新学年开始了。共和国的党组织，为了使农村党员能有成效地学习马列主义，曾预先做了许多准备工作。
    卡萨赫斯坦共产党（布）中央委员会，曾举行了共和国宣传工作者的讨论会，参加该会的有五百八十名讲演员、正式宣传员和区委会、市委会及州委会宣传部的领导工作者们。
    在八九两月，新学年的准备问题，就已经在党的基层组织会议中，在卡萨赫斯坦党的区委会、市委会和州委会的全会中讨论过了。
    党组织对于培养和加强宣传员干部，寄与了极大的注意。宣传员的行列内，充满着最有素养的、能够保证高等业务质量的共产党员们。共和国内共选拔任命了约一万三千名宣传员，其中九千名是在农业地区。他们绝大多数都是党和苏维埃工作者的小组和学校的领导人，是学校教师、工程师和农业专门家们的小组和学校的领导人。受过高等教育的宣传员逐渐增加起来了。
    依据联共（布）中央委员会决议所创设的训练班，在培养宣传员工作中起了很大的作用。有二千五百名城市宣传员和一千五百六十名农村宣传员在这些训练班中学习。农村宣传员训练班中的大多数听众，都是由各遥远的村落和畜产地区来的人。
    对于未加入训练班的小组和政治学校的领导者们，在区委会下依照专门计划举行十天为期的讨论会。讲演和报告主要由党的工作者和州中心学校中的教师来担任。讨论会中约有七千名农村宣传员参加。
    学校和小组中业务的思想内容，不仅系于宣传员的理论修养，而且还注重使他们有能力把材料献给听众。因此，在讨论会和训练班的工作中，宣传方法问题也占着重大的地位。例如，在南卡萨赫州委会附设的训练班中，对宣传员玛基托夫和穆萨耶夫同志的经验，曾展开了详细的讨论。
    当然，加强对宣传员的教育，是不能只局限于训练班的。这需要党组织时刻关心于提高宣传员的理论水平和宣传技巧。
    布尔塞维克的宣传员，执行着党的重要使命：他不仅要给与听众一定的知识，而且还要是一位政治教师，以帮助党员们更深刻地了解并坚决地执行党的政策，提高他们在争取完成经济计划中的先锋队作用。一个宣传员如能顺利地完成委托给他的任务，必须具备下列条件：他自己要不屈不挠地研究马列主义理论，精细地研讨布尔塞维克党和苏维埃政府的内外政策。
    众所周知，帮助宣传员最重要的和最有效的形式之一，即是党的区委会所附设的经常活动着的讨论会。共和国的许多区内，讨论会从前都是无系统的，对于方法问题和交流经验问题，都没有给予应有的注意，没有时常考虑到各区地域的分散性。其结果，使遥远的集体农场和国营农场的许多宣传员，就不可能正规地参加讨论会的业务研究了。
    我们曾尽力克服这些缺点。尤其是在地域分散的区内，在村苏维埃和机器拖拉机站下都附设了讨论会。对于最遥远的集体农场和畜产地域的农村宣传员，将广泛地利用下乡指导的制度。同时对保证这些宣传员所必需的政治、文艺和方法的参考书籍，采取着特殊的监督。塔尔推古尔干州委会曾有过一个很好的倡举：它关怀到给每个宣传员组成一个小文库。
    去年，对党员个别地接近的问题，我们并不是普遍都遵行了。而现在，在确定党员从事某种方式的学习之前，即进行了个别谈话。这使得小组和政治学校，有可能把更具有类似水平的听众组织在一起。从事政治学习的，现在有十五万以上的农村党员、数万青年团员和非党的积极分子。设立了约有四千个研究联共（布）党史的小组，三千八百个政治学校和一千多个研究列宁和斯大林传记的小组。此外还有二百三十五个区党的夜校，校中的学员主要是党的领导者、苏维埃工作者和经济工作者、宣传员、教师和农业专门家们。
    对吸收在畜产地区工作的党员加入政治学习，也给与了很大的注意。在共和国大多数有畜产的州内，红色帐幕领导者的人选是经过仔细地考虑并加强着的，这个工作岗位总是派一些政治上有素养的党员们。同时还使他们负起领导政治学校的任务。例如，阿尔玛阿金州的伊里区委会，在畜产地区组织了四个政治学校。此外，在畜产区的每个红色帐幕和初级小学下还为文化很低的党员组织了一般教育的学校。
    在新学年的筹备期间，曾采用了这样的方法：即尽可能地引导大多数区内和村内的积极分子独立地研读马列主义理论。
    党员政治自学的成就，对马列主义理论的精深理解，很多方面是系于临时指导者的素质。我们的有资格做为指导者的，都是党的领导工作者。例如，北卡萨赫斯坦州的布拉耶夫斯基区的指导者，就是区委会书记包依琴科和加斯可耶夫同志，以及区委会的委员。为了帮助这些指导者们，我们组织了经常活动的讨论会。
    共产党员对研读马列主义理论增长着的兴趣，迫切需要区内有正规的循环讲演。我们正实验着组织口述的和书面讲演的未来计划，准备着更合理地运用讲演者的力量，以在区内组织讲演同时并经过书面的宣传加强对积极分子的帮助。
    党的办公厅有责任对宣传员和党员给与巨大的帮助。南卡萨赫斯坦州沙乌里得尔区委会党的办公厅的工作经验，是值得注意的。它把区内最好的讲演者和宣传员的力量都团结在自己周围。党的办公厅以依靠积极分子的力量经常检查小组和政治学校所学习的质量。同时经过报纸、无线电广播，并借助下乡的指导人员传播最好的宣传员的工作经验，举办交流经验的会议，组织宣传员的互相观摩。
    提高党的教育质量的一个最重要方法即是报纸。今年，共和国和各州的报纸，开始更正规地刊登理论和方法的论文，刊登指导、答读者问和论列宁和斯大林著作出版的文章。党校和小组中宣传员的工作经验，很好地传布开了。
    但是，报纸宣传中的一些严重缺点，还没有完全克服。刊登的理论文章，尤其是关于宣传方法的文章，没有明确的次序。没有经常地研究到从事政治自学的宣传员和党员的问题，也很少刊载对目前问题的通俗讲演以帮助青年党员。
    报纸的编辑部，应当拟订精确的计划，刊登与党的教育网中学习资料配合的理论文章。
    上次的州委会、市委会和区委会的全会中，对某些党委会（加拉干金和东卡萨赫斯坦州委会）的领导党员学习的方式，展开了尖锐的批评。正确地指出了某些州委会、市委会和区委会把党的教育的领导事业，在一定程度上，看成为形式主义的东西，而很少监督政治学校和小组中的业务质量。
    卡萨赫斯坦党组织，遵从联共（布）中央委员会的指示，加强着自己在党的教育各个系统中的作用，保证业务的高等水平，努力改善着共产党员的马列主义教育。
