Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 2nd—Cadres of the National Army from the Ili, Tacheng, and Altai districts, who were ordered to work in southern Xinjiang, held a symposium at the headquarters in Yining on November 15. Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Provisional People's Government, Wang Zhen, Commander of the First Corps of the People's Liberation Army, Seypidin, Member of the Central People's Government, and General Liesken, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, attended the meeting to provide guidance. Seypidin delivered a speech first, saying that he hoped that after the National Army cadres arrived in southern Xinjiang, they would work together with the People's Liberation Army to relieve the suffering of the people of all ethnic groups and build a prosperous and happy new southern Xinjiang. Commander Wang Zhen said: You are going to work in southern Xinjiang on the orders of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and General Peng Dehuai, which is the most glorious task. The National Army is a revolutionary army representing the interests of the broad masses of the people. In the past, you bravely fought against the counter-revolutionary forces in the three districts of Ili, Tacheng, and Altai. This time you are going to southern Xinjiang, you should be an armed fighting team, always vigilant against counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the people's construction undertakings; at the same time, you should also be a mass work team, deeply investigating the hardships and hopes of the working people, always standing with the working people, and serving the people. Chairman Bao Erhan encouraged the cadres of the National Army to abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army and learn modestly after arriving in southern Xinjiang. Finally, Major Maimaitiming of the National Army, on behalf of the National Army cadres attending the meeting, guaranteed that they would follow the instructions of all leaders, study hard, and complete the task together with the People's Liberation Army.
