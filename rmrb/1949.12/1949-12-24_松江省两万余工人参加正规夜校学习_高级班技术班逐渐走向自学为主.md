　　Over 20,000 Workers in Songjiang Province Participate in Formal Night School Studies; Advanced and Technical Classes Gradually Shift Towards Self-Study

　　[This newspaper report] In Songjiang Province, a total of 22,898 workers are participating in formal studies, accounting for over 24 percent of the total number of organized workers in the province (95,685). According to the "Labor Movement Materials" of the Songjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions last month, 171 formal workers' night schools have been established in 28 cities, counties, and mining areas, including Harbin, Mudanjiang, Hulan, and Hegang, with a total of 550 classes. These schools are able to conduct classes in a planned, systematic, and step-by-step manner. The workers participating in the study are generally divided into elementary (grades 1, 2, 3, and 4), advanced, and technical classes after testing and examination. The educational content is mostly focused on culture and technology (Chinese accounts for two-thirds in elementary classes), supplemented by politics. Most have established formal examination systems, promotion and demotion systems, vacation systems, and study organizations. Teachers in each school generally start from reality, study the language of the workers, familiarize themselves with the lives of the workers, and improve teaching methods bit by bit. Advanced and technical classes mostly teach according to the actual experience and needs of the workers, gradually guiding them towards self-study, with teachers only providing guidance. Through learning, the cultural level of the workers has improved rapidly. For example, in the Xifujia District Workers' Night School in Harbin City, first-graders (originally illiterate) can generally recognize more than 300 characters in four and a half months, can write simple leave requests, and record their own household accounts; arithmetic is learned up to two-digit multiplication; the technical class of the school could not draw before, but now they can all read and draw drawings, and the average score of the whole class is above 90 points. At the same time, through cultural learning, the workers' awareness has been raised, promoting the improvement of production efficiency.

　　　　Main Experiences: Avoid Interrupting Learning Due to Temporary Tasks; Select Teachers Who Are Enthusiastic About Serving Workers

According to the experience of workers' night schools in various places: (1) The key to running a good night school lies in having a clear direction, appropriate teaching materials, and good teachers who are consciously willing to serve the workers. Secondly, the establishment of school and student organizations and various systems, special personnel in charge, and specific leadership are all indispensable and cannot be ignored in implementing the direction and teaching plan. Workers from six state-owned factories in Mudanjiang City reflected after participating in the night school: "The study in the district night school is planned, disciplined, and systematic. We learn what we should learn, just like in school. When studying in the factory, those at the top lectured and those at the bottom talked and made noise, and even could 'slip away' (leave at will), and sometimes there were no classes, so we didn't learn anything." This proves that workers demand formal learning.

(2) To run a formal, long-term school, it is necessary to establish a set of step-by-step systems (periodic examinations, promotion and demotion systems, vacation systems, study organizations, etc.). At the same time, educating workers must rely on the workers, give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and manage the night school themselves to implement all necessary systems.

(3) Persist in the system and do not interrupt it (especially state-owned factories should pay attention to this issue). Generally, learning should be avoided from being stopped by temporary tasks, as it will be difficult to resume. As for some temporary tasks of the Party, government, trade union, and youth league, they can be carried out during the night school holidays. This can only be achieved with the attention of the leadership and the support of all parties. At the same time, study time should also take into account the workers' private affairs and public affairs such as meetings in the factory. Learning should not be continuous every day, without giving workers the opportunity to handle private affairs and participate in other activities.

(4) Close integration between teachers and workers can reduce the mobility of night school students. Teachers actively approach students, making workers feel interested through singing, talking about work, talking about life, or playing ball, naturally reducing absenteeism. When there is absenteeism, the teachers should examine the teaching methods to see if there are any aspects that do not suit the workers' tastes; after understanding the reasons, they can write letters or go to the factory to talk to the workers, which can further reduce student mobility.

(5) In teaching methods, we must strengthen review, praise more and criticize less, and classroom teaching should be combined with homework assignments, mastering the characteristics of workers' learning for teaching. In teaching, we should flexibly cultivate students' correct learning attitudes to consolidate learning. In addition, strengthening mutual assistance in groups and having Party members and Youth League members act as role models to drive the backward are all effective methods in teaching.

### 松江省两万余工人参加正规夜校学习　高级班技术班逐渐走向自学为主

　　松江省两万余工人参加正规夜校学习
    高级班技术班逐渐走向自学为主
    【本报讯】松江全省已有二万二千八百九十八名工人参加正规的学习，占全省有组织工人总数（九五六八五）的百分之二十四强。据松江省总工会上月份“工运材料”载称，在哈尔滨、牡丹江、呼兰、鹤岗等二十八个市、县和矿区，已建立了正规的工人夜校一百七十一处，计五百五十个班。这些学校，都能有计划、有制度、按步就班地上课。参加学习的工人，一般的是经过测验考试后分编为初级（一、二、三、四年级），高级和技术班上课。教育内容大部是以文化、技术为主（初级班国文占三分之二），政治为辅。大多建立了正规的考试制度，升降班制度，休假制度和学习组织等。各校教师一般做到从实际出发，研究工人语言，熟习工人生活，一点一滴地改进教学方法；高级班和技术班，大多根据工人实际经验和需要教学，逐渐引导到自学为主，教员只加以辅导。经过学习，工人文化水平迅速的提高。如哈尔宾市西傅家区工人夜校四个半月中，一年级（原为文盲）一般能认三百多字，会写简单的请假条，记自己的生活帐；算术学到两位乘法；该校技术班从前不会画图，现在都会看会画了，全班总平均成绩九十分以上。同时，通过文化学习，提高了工人的觉悟，推动了生产效率的提高。
    　　　　主要经验　避免因临时任务中断学习　选择热诚为工人服务教员
    根据各地工人夜校的经验：（一）办好夜校主要在方针明确、教材适当和有自觉的愿为工人服务的好教员，其次学校及学生组织和各种制度的建立，专人负责，具体领导等都是贯彻方针和教学计划不可忽视和缺少的。牡丹江市六个公营工厂工人参加夜校后反映：“区夜校的学习，有计划、有纪律、有制度，该学啥就学啥，真象学校一样。本厂学习时，上面上课下面乱说乱闹，甚至可以‘蹓号’（随便退席），有时又不上课，学不着啥。”这证明工人是要求正规的学习的。
    （二）办正规的、长远打算的学校，必须建立按步就班的一套制度（定期的考试，升降班制度，休假制度，学习组织等）。同时教育工人必须依靠工人，发挥他们的积极性和创造性，自己来管理夜校，贯彻一切必要的制度。
    （三）坚持制度不要中断（特别是公营工厂要注意此问题），一般应避免被临时任务使学习停下来，停下就不好收拾的。至于党、政、工、团方面的一些临时任务，可在夜校休假日进行。这必须领导上重视，各方面支持才能办到。但同时学习时间也应照顾工人的私事和工厂中会议等公事，不能每日不断的学习，不给予工人处理私事及参加其他活动的机会。
    （四）教员和工人密切结合、能减少夜校学生的流动性。教员主动的接近同学，通过唱歌、谈工作、谈生活或是打球等，使工人觉得有意思，自然缺席的减少了。缺席时，教员方面从教学方法上检讨是否有不合工人口味的地方；了解原因后，可以写信或去工厂找工人谈，这样更能减少学生的流动性。
    （五）教学方法，要加强复习，多表扬少批评，课堂教学应与布置习题结合，掌握工人对学习的特点教学。在教学中应灵活的培养学生正确的学习态度以巩固学习。此外，通过党团员的模范行动带动落后，加强小组互助，都是教学中的有效办法。
