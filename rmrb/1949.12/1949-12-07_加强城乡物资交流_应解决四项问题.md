　　Strengthening Urban-Rural Material Exchange
    Should Solve Four Problems

    [Another News] Reporter Gu Weijin reports: At the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, farmer representatives from Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces all pointed out that rural local products and industrial raw materials lacked sales channels. Farmer representatives from Hebei Province stated: In the Hengshui area, approximately 10 million jin of arsenic sulfide are produced annually, but no one purchases it, leaving it abandoned on the ground. Most areas of the Cangxian area are disaster areas and urgently need to sell saltpeter, reeds, sesame, and straw braid to exchange for grain, waterwheels, and insecticides, but no one is doing this. Jingxing County produces approximately 3 million jin of medicinal materials annually, but most are burned as firewood due to lack of purchasers. Cixian County produces 200,000 jin of sulfur monthly, but production is gradually decreasing due to lack of purchasers. The tobacco leaves in Neiqiu and Lincheng are not purchased and are completely spoiled. Pepper in Nanwu County has no sales channels, leading the masses to cut down many pepper trees. The Tangshan area's glauber salt, saltpeter, glass stone, wood, medicinal materials, asbestos, gypsum, and refractory stone, the Dingxian area's soybeans, peanuts, cotton, pig bristles, and chicken feathers, the Tongxian area's arsenic sulfide and saltpeter, and the Xingtai area's fur, peanuts, and hemp seeds all lack sales channels. Farmer representatives from Shanxi Province stated: The Jinan area produces 2 million jin of gypsum daily, 8 million jin of arsenic sulfide annually, 500,000 jin of saltpeter annually, over 70,000 jin of iron daily in Yangquan, and sulfur from various places, all without sales channels. Xing County has 40 million jin of wool, over 10,000 jin of pig bristles, 36 million eggs, and various animal skins, but local trade departments lack funds to purchase them, waiting for outside purchases. Yicheng County has over 600,000 jin of surplus oil and hopes for outside purchases. The county produces over 200 musk pods annually, which cannot be sold. The Yuci area produces 20,000 dan of hemp seeds, 1.52 million jin of castor seeds, 12 million jin of persimmons, 5 million jin of walnuts, 4.2 million jin of black dates and small dates, as well as pepper, pears, apricots, etc., all with poor sales. Farmer representatives from Pingyuan Province stated: The Xinxiang area produces 17 million jin of arsenic sulfide and 40 million jin of saltpeter annually. In the past, the military industry department purchased saltpeter, allowing the people to survive disasters. Now, no one purchases it, causing hardship for the people's lives. Boai produces 10,000 jin of sulfur daily, but most operations have ceased due to lack of sales channels. Huixian County produces 15 million jin of walnuts, 6 million jin of codonopsis pilosula and forsythia, 10 million jin of tree nails, and 500,000 jin of oak shells (used as dye) annually. Production has decreased due to lack of sales channels. The Puyang area's ten counties harvested approximately 49.4 million jin of peanuts this year. Due to lack of purchasers and poor sales, one jin of peanuts cannot even be exchanged for one jin of millet. Neihuang County produced over 14.88 million jin of dates this year, but most rely on external sales, except for a small portion used for winemaking locally, but there are currently no sales channels. The Heze area has a surplus of local products, including 190,000 jin of silk, 3 million jin of alkaline soil, 150,000 jin of saltpeter and arsenic sulfide, approximately 800,000 pieces of raccoon dog and lambskin, and over 1,200 jin of pig bristles, all urgently needing outside purchases and adjustments for exchange. Yuncheng and Dingtao produced over 9.283 million jin of cotton this year, but local trade companies can only purchase one-tenth of it. Other areas also feel that local products have poor sales channels. In addition, farmer representatives from the three provinces generally pointed out a lack of various agricultural tools such as waterwheels, as well as oil presses, cotton gins, flour mills, fertilizers, insecticides, livestock disease medicines, matches, kerosene, salt, foreign cloth, dyes, and alkaline noodles.

    Farmer representatives from the three provinces unanimously hope that through this industrial exhibition, the problem of material exchange can be gradually resolved, allowing local products to be sold smoothly and rural necessities to be supplied. In addition to some provinces bringing many samples of local products and contacting manufacturers to sign exchange contracts, in order to fundamentally solve material exchange, farmer representatives and the industrial and commercial sectors have held multiple discussions and studies, believing that the following issues must be resolved:

    1. Specialized companies must be combined with cooperatives.

    In the past, specialized companies purchased and sold materials, generally through local cooperatives. However, many cooperatives have unsound operations and lack of funds, making it difficult to complete this task. Some cooperatives also affected the purchase of materials for specialized companies due to unsuitable prices or delayed payments. Some cooperatives have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint, and specialized companies are unwilling to purchase and sell materials through cooperatives. Cooperatives cannot get full support from specialized companies, so naturally, business development has difficulties, and specialized companies solely relying on branch companies also find it difficult to complete tasks satisfactorily. In order to make urban and rural material exchange develop smoothly, specialized companies and cooperatives must be closely combined in business in the future. First of all, specialized companies must establish the concept of relying on and supporting cooperatives, organizing and developing cooperatives widely, making them the most important link in carrying out material exchange. At the same time, cooperatives must overcome problems such as a purely profit-seeking viewpoint, so that the relationship between the two sides can be normal, and material exchange can be organized jointly in a planned way.

    2. Reasonable exchange ratios should be appropriately grasped.

    In the past (referring to before the Anti-Japanese War, same below), one jin of pepper could be exchanged for thirty jin of millet, but now one jin of pepper cannot even be exchanged for three jin of millet. In Xinxiang, one jin of sulfur used to be exchanged for nine jin of millet, but now it can only be exchanged for two jin. In the Huxi area of Pingyuan, one jin of oil used to be exchanged for five jin of grain, but now it can only be exchanged for two jin. In Linyu County, one hundred walnuts can only be exchanged for one jin of millet. In the Puyang area, one jin of peanuts cannot even be exchanged for one jin of millet. These are all unreasonable exchange ratios. In the future, in order to make them reasonable, the organization of specialized companies must be sound, a commercial information network must be established in various places, and meticulous investigation and statistical work must be carried out to grasp the production situation and export situation in various places, so as to gradually grasp the laws of supply and demand and gradually grasp reasonable exchange ratios.

    3. Adjust freight rates.

    Many materials, such as pears, dates, and other bulky items, have freight rates from the place of production to Tianjin that are higher than the cost, so farmers hope that merchants will go to the countryside to purchase, and merchants hope that farmers will transport them into the city. As a result, materials cannot be sold. In the future, freight rates must be appropriately adjusted. In addition, there is a lack of transportation cars, which delays transportation time, and both labor and capital are lost. In the future, the number of cars should be increased as much as possible.

    4. Vigorously organize private merchants to serve the national economy.

    At present, cooperatives have not been established universally (there are no cooperatives south of the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province, and only county cooperatives north of the Yellow River), or they have been established but are not sound. Based on this situation, especially based on past experience, relying solely on cooperatives and specialized companies to organize urban and rural material exchange still has many difficulties at present. Therefore, it is very necessary to organize the vast number of private merchants and give play to their strength. However, to achieve this, it is necessary to solve the difficulties encountered by private merchants in material exchange, such as the inadequate solution of transportation, the unreasonable adjustment of foreign exchange rates, and the unreasonable division of labor between trade and trade organizations.

    The Urban-Rural Material Exchange Guidance Committee is currently being prepared, and the above problems may be gradually resolved reasonably in the future.

　　加强城乡物资交流
    应解决四项问题
    【又讯】记者古维进报导：在天津工业展览会上，河北、山西、平原三省农民代表纷纷提出乡村土产及工业原料没有销路。河北省农民代表提出：衡水专区，年产砒硝约一千万斤，无人收购弃置于地；沧县专区绝大部分地区为灾区，急需把火硝、苇子、芝麻、草帽辫等推销，换取粮食、水车、杀虫剂等，但没有人做这件事；井陉县药材年产三百万斤，以无人收购，大部当柴烧；磁县硫磺月产二十万斤，以无人收购，产量渐减；内邱、临城的烟叶，无人收购，全部放坏；南武县的花椒没有销路，致使群众砍伐不少花椒树；唐山专区的皮硝、火硝、玻璃石、木材、药材、石棉、石膏、耐火石，定县专区的大豆、花生、棉花、猪鬃、鸡毛，通县专区的砒硝、火硝，刑台专区的皮毛、花生、大麻子等均无销路。山西省农民代表提出：晋南专区石膏日产二百万斤，砒硝年产八百多万斤，火硝年产五十万斤，阳泉日产铁七万多斤，以及各地之硫磺等，均无销路；兴县有羊毛四千万斤，猪鬃万余斤、鸡蛋三千六百万个，及各种兽皮等，因当地贸易部门资金薄弱，收购不了，等待外地收购；翼城县有剩余油类六十余万斤，希望外地收购，该县麝香年产二百余个，不能推销；榆次专区年产大麻子二万担，蓖麻子一百五十二万斤，柿子一千二百万斤，核桃五百万斤，黑枣、小枣四百二十万斤，及花椒、梨、杏等均销路不畅。平原省农民代表提出：新乡专区年产砒硝一千七百万斤，火硝四千万斤，以前有军工部收购火硝，人民曾依此渡过灾荒；现无人收购，人民生活感到困难；博爱日产硫磺一万斤，因无销路，大部停工；辉县年产核桃一千五百万斤，党参、连壳共六百万斤，木丁一千万斤，橡壳五十万斤（作染料），因缺乏销路，生产量降低；濮阳专区十个县，今年约收获花生四千九百余万斤，由于无人收购，销路不好，一斤售价尚不能换回一斤小米；内黄县今年产枣一千四百八十余万斤，除本区做酒用一小部外，大部依靠外销，但现在毫无销路；菏泽专区过剩的土产有：蚕丝十九万斤，土硷三百万斤，火硝、砒硝十五万斤，猾子皮、胎羊皮约八十万张，猪鬃一千二百余斤，均迫切需要外地收购和调剂交换；郓城、定陶今年产棉花九百二十八万三千余斤，当地贸易公司只能收购十分之一。其他各专区也均感土产销路不好。另外，三省农民代表普遍提出缺乏水车等各种农具及榨油机、轧花机、磨面机、肥料、杀虫剂、畜疫药品、火柴、煤油、食盐、洋布、染料、碱面等。
    三省农民代表一致希望经过此次工展，能够逐渐解决物资交流问题，使土产品得以畅销，而农村必需品得到供给。除有的省份带来许多土产样品，和各厂商接洽订立交换合同外，但为从根本上解决物资交流，农民代表与工商业界多次座谈研究，认为必须解决下列诸问题：
    一、专业公司必须与合作社结合起来。
    过去专业公司购销物资，一般是通过各地合作社；但有许多合作社业务不健全，资金短缺，难于完成这一任务；也有些合作社给专业公司购销物资，因价钱不相宜，或付款迟缓影响了收购；有些合作社存在单纯营利观点，专业公司便不愿意通过合作社购销物资。合作社得不到专业公司充分扶植，自然业务开展有困难，而专业公司仅依靠分支公司，也很难圆满完成任务。为了使城乡物资交流得畅顺发展，今后专业公司及合作社，在业务上必须紧密结合起来。首先专业公司在观念上要确定依靠合作社，扶植合作社，把合作社广泛地组织起来，发展起来，使之成为开展物资交流最主要的一环；同时合作社必须克服单纯营利观点等毛病，这样双方关系才得正常，有计划地共同组织物资交流。
    二、要适当掌握合理的交换比率。
    过去（指抗日战争前，下同）一斤花椒换三十斤小米，现在一斤花椒换不到三斤小米；新乡过去一斤硫磺换九斤小米，现在只换二斤；平原湖西区过去一斤油换五斤粮，现在只换二斤；临榆县一百个核桃才换一斤小米；濮阳专区一斤花生尚换不到一斤小米。这些都是不合理的交换比率。今后要使之合理，一定要专业公司的组织健全起来，建立各地商情网，缜密进行调查统计工作，掌握各地生产情况及出口情况，进而逐渐掌握供求规律，才能逐渐掌握合理的交换比率。
    三、调整运费。
    许多物资如梨、枣及其他笨重东西、从产地运津、运费高于成本，因此农民希望商人下乡收购，商人希望农民运进城来，结果物资无法销售。今后必须适当调整运费。另外，运输车皮缺乏，运输耽误时间，人力资金均受损失，今后要尽可能增加车皮。
    四、大力组织私商为国家经济服务。
    目前合作社未普遍建立（平原省黄河以南还没有合作社，黄河以北只有县合作社），或建立了而不健全；专业公司成立不久，组织亦不健全。根据这种情况，特别根据过去经验，仅依靠合作社与专业公司组织城乡物资交流，目前尚有许多困难；因此应把广大私商组织起来，发挥他们的力量，十分必要。但是，要作到这点，就要解决私商在物资交流中所遇困难，如运输未适当解决，外汇牌价尚未合理调整，在贸易上和贸易机关尚未合理分工等。
    目前城乡物资交流指导委员会正在筹备，今后对上述问题可能逐步得到合理解决。
