Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 19th: As we celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday, we are republishing here an essay and a speech made by Chairman Mao Zedong in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi, ten years ago to celebrate Stalin's sixtieth birthday. In these two works, Chairman Mao used a particularly colloquial tone to explain to the Chinese people the reasons for celebrating Stalin's birthday. These reasons are precisely what we want to promote to the broad masses of the people today. It should be pointed out that today's domestic and international environment has undergone great changes compared to ten years ago. In 1939, China was in the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the Chinese die-hard faction headed by Chiang Kai-shek, which was still nominally in the anti-Japanese camp, had already begun to collude with the Japanese aggressors to launch brutal attacks on the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and other people's democratic forces. Internationally, the imperialist camp was then divided into the Anglo-American-French group led by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and the German-Italian-Japanese group led by Hitler. Although these two groups were in conflict with each other at the time, the basic policy of the Chamberlain group was to hate the Soviet Union, refuse to cooperate with the Soviet Union against Hitler, and try their best to guide Hitler to attack the Soviet Union. In the East, they ostensibly sympathized with China but actually aided the Japanese aggressors. In short, they wanted to sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight in order to eliminate revolutionary forces. At that time, only the Soviet Union truly aided China's resistance against Japan, but Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government in China, along with the Chamberlain group, hated the Soviet Union. These were the circumstances ten years ago. Now, after the Second World War, the world is still divided into two opposing camps: the counter-revolutionary aggressive camp of imperialism and the peaceful camp of democracy and socialism. However, the counter-revolutionary camp (whose leader has changed from Chamberlain to Truman) has been greatly weakened, while the camp of democracy and socialism, under the leadership of the great Stalin, has been greatly strengthened. The Soviet Union is even stronger, the Chinese people's revolution has been victorious, and in Europe and Asia, many people's democratic countries have been established, all of which are good friends of the Chinese people. Therefore, the truth that Chairman Mao stated ten years ago, that "only the direction indicated by Stalin and only Stalin's assistance can liberate mankind from disaster," has now been fully proven. The full text of Chairman Mao's essay and speech is as follows:

　　Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People
　　(December 20, 1939) Mao Zedong

　　December 21st this year is Comrade Stalin's sixtieth birthday. This birthday, all over the world, as long as people know about it and are revolutionaries, it can be expected that it will arouse cordial and enthusiastic celebration in their hearts.

　　Celebrating Stalin is not just a perfunctory matter. Celebrating Stalin means supporting him, supporting his cause, supporting the victory of socialism, supporting the direction he has indicated for mankind, and supporting our own dear friend. Because now the majority of mankind in the whole world are sufferers, only the direction indicated by Stalin and only Stalin's assistance can liberate mankind from disaster.

　　We, the Chinese people, are at a time in history when disaster is most profound, and we are in a time when we most urgently need people's assistance. As the Book of Songs says: "The birds cry 'ying, ying,' seeking a response from their friends." We are exactly at this time.

　　But, who are our friends?

　　One kind of so-called friends, they claim to be our friends, and some of us call them friends without thinking. But this kind of friend can only belong to the category of Li Linfu of the Tang Dynasty. Li Linfu was the prime minister of the Tang Dynasty and was a famous person known as "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted." Now these "friends" are also precisely "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted" friends. Who are these people? They are a section of imperialists who verbally express sympathy for China.

　　Another kind of friend is different. They give us genuine sympathy, and they treat us as brothers. Who are these people? They are the Soviet people, they are Stalin.

　　No country has ever abolished its privileges in China, only the Soviet Union has abolished them.

　　During the Northern Expedition, all the imperialists opposed us, only the Soviet Union assisted us.

　　Since the War of Resistance, no imperialist government has truly assisted us, only the Soviet Union has assisted us with a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

　　Isn't this clear enough?

　　The cause of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, only socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and workers can truly assist us; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance.

　　Stalin is a loyal friend of the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. The Chinese people's respect and love for Stalin and their friendship with the Soviet Union are completely sincere. Any attempt to sow discord, create rumors, and slander will ultimately be useless.

　　Speech at the Yan'an All-Circles Celebration of Stalin's Sixtieth Birthday
　　(December 21, 1939) Mao Zedong

　　Today we are holding a grand meeting to celebrate Comrade Stalin's sixtieth birthday. "It is rare for a man to live to seventy," and sixty years old is also rare in this world. But why do we celebrate Stalin alone? And such a celebration is not only in Yan'an, but also throughout the country, and throughout the world. As long as people know that today is his birthday, as long as they understand his character, as long as they are oppressed, they will celebrate him. The reason is that Comrade Stalin is the savior of all the oppressed. Who are the people who oppose celebrating him and don't like celebrating him? They are those who are not oppressed themselves but only oppress others, first and foremost the imperialists. Comrades! It is the first time in history that everyone has celebrated the birthday of a foreigner who is thousands of miles away.

　　This is because he is leading the great Soviet Union, because he is leading the great Communist International, because he is leading the emancipation movement of all mankind, and helping China fight Japan.

　　The world is now divided into two fighting fronts, one is imperialism, which is the front of oppression; the other is socialism, which is the front of resistance to oppression. Some people in the national revolutionary front of colonies and semi-colonies feel as if they are standing in the middle, but its opponent is imperialism, and it cannot but regard socialism as a friend, and cannot but belong to the side of the revolutionary front that resists oppression. China's die-hard elements want to be both a prostitute and erect a memorial archway. They oppose the Communist Party with one hand and resist Japan with the other, claiming to be centrists, but they will never succeed. If they do not repent, they will eventually go to the counter-revolutionary side. The two fronts of revolution and counter-revolution must have a master, and must have a commander. Who is the commander of the counter-revolutionary front? It is imperialism, it is Chamberlain. Who is the commander in the revolutionary front? It is socialism, it is Stalin. Comrade Stalin is the leader of the world revolution. This is a very important matter. This Stalin has emerged in the midst of all mankind, this is a major event: with him, things are easier to handle. You know, Marx is dead, Engels is also dead, Lenin is also dead, if there is no Stalin, who will give orders? This is really fortunate. Now there is a Soviet Union in the world, there is a Communist Party, and there is a Stalin, and the world's affairs are easier to handle. What does a revolutionary commander do? To make everyone have food to eat, clothes to wear, houses to live in, and books to read. And to do this, we must lead hundreds of millions of people to fight against the oppressors, and make them get the final victory. This is what Stalin wants to do. If this is the case, then, should all the oppressed people celebrate Stalin? I think it is necessary, it is right. We must celebrate him, support him, and also learn from him.

　　We must learn from him in two aspects, one is in terms of principle, and the other is in terms of cause.

　　There are thousands of strands of Marxist principles, but in the final analysis, it is just one sentence: "Rebellion is justified." For thousands of years, it has always been said that: oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, rebellion is unjustified. Since Marxism came out, it has overturned this old case. This is a great achievement. This principle was obtained by the proletariat from struggle, and Marx made a conclusion. According to this principle, we then resist, we then struggle, we then engage in socialism. What merit does Comrade Stalin have? He developed this principle, developed Marxism-Leninism, and created a very clear, very specific, and very vivid principle for the oppressed people of the world, which is the entire theory of establishing a revolutionary front, overthrowing imperialism, overthrowing capitalism, and establishing a socialist society.

　　In terms of cause, it is to put the principle into practice. The cause of building socialism was not completed by Marx, Engels, or Lenin, but Stalin completed it. This is an earth-shattering event. Before the two five-year plans of the Soviet Union, the newspapers of the bourgeoisie in various countries said every day that the Soviet Union was in trouble, that socialism was unreliable, but what about today? Chamberlain's mouth has been shut, and the mouths of those stubborn factions in China have also been shut. They all admit that the Soviet Union has won.

　　In addition to helping our War of Resistance Against Japan in terms of principle, Stalin also gave us help in terms of career, that is, material help. Thanks to the victory of Stalin's cause, he helped us with many airplanes, artillery pieces, aviators, military advisors in various war zones, and loans. What other country in the world helps us like this? What other class, what other party, what other person-led country in the world helps us like this? Besides the Soviet Union, besides the proletariat, besides the Communist Party, besides Stalin, who else is there?

　　Now some people, they call themselves our friends, but they can only belong to the type of Li Linfu of the Tang Dynasty. This Mr. Li Linfu was a "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted" person. Imperialists are all honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted. Chamberlain is the current Li Linfu. Which imperialist has abolished all the privileges of various countries in China, such as the right to station troops, consular jurisdiction, extraterritoriality, etc.? Not one. Only the Soviet Union has abolished them.

　　In the past, Marxism-Leninism guided the world revolution in theory. Now something has been added, which can help the world revolution materially, and this is Stalin's great achievement.

　　After celebrating Comrade Stalin's birthday, we should also publicize this matter to the whole country, explain it clearly to 450 million people, so that the Chinese people all understand that only the socialist Soviet Union, only Stalin, is our good friend in China.

### 毛主席在十年前所作的庆祝斯大林六十寿辰的论文和演说

　　毛主席在十年前所作的庆祝斯大林六十寿辰的论文和演说
    【新华社北京十九日电】在庆祝斯大林七十寿辰的时候，我们将毛泽东主席十年前在陕北延安庆祝斯大林六十寿辰的一篇论文和一篇演说重行发表在这里。在这两篇作品中，毛主席用了特别通俗的口吻，向中国人民解释了为什么要庆祝斯大林寿辰的道理，这些道理，也正是我们今天所要向广大人民宣传的。应当指出，今天和十年前的国内外环境有了大的变化。一九三九年的中国正处在抗日战争初期，当时表面上仍然留在抗日阵营中的以蒋介石为首的中国顽固派，已经开始和日本侵略者在一起，对于共产党、八路军、新四军和其他人民民主力量举行残酷的进攻。在国际上，帝国主义阵营当时分裂为以英国首相张伯伦为首的英美法集团和以希特勒为首的德意日集团，这两个集团当时虽已互相冲突，但是张伯伦集团的基本政策却是仇视苏联，拒绝与苏联合作反对希特勒，并且竭力引导希特勒进攻苏联；而在东方，则是表面上同情中国，实际上援助日本侵略者。总之是要自己坐山观虎斗，以便消灭革命力量。当时真正援助中国抗日的只有苏联，但是中国的蒋介石反动政府却和张伯伦集团一起仇视苏联。这些是十年前的情形。现在世界上经过了第二次世界大战，仍然分为两条斗争的阵线，即帝国主义的反革命侵略阵线和民主与社会主义的和平阵线，但是反革命阵线（其领袖由张伯伦变为杜鲁门）已大大削弱，而民主与社会主义阵线在伟大的斯大林的领导之下，则已大大加强。苏联是已经更加强大了，中国人民革命是已经胜利了，在欧洲和亚洲，已经成立了很多人民民主国家，这些国家也都是中国人民的好朋友。因此，毛主席十年前所说的，“只有斯大林指示的方向，只有斯大林的援助，才能解脱人类的灾难”的道理，现在是完全证明了。毛主席的论文和演说全文如下：
　　斯大林是中国人民的朋友
    （一九三九年十二月二十日）毛泽东
    今年十二月二十一日，是斯大林同志的六十岁生日。这个生日，在全世界上，只要是知道的又是革命的人们，可以料得到，会在他们心中引起亲切的热烈的庆祝的。
    庆祝斯大林，这不是一件应景的事情。庆祝斯大林，这就是说，拥护他，拥护他的事业，拥护社会主义的胜利，拥护他给人类指示的方向，拥护自己的亲切的朋友。因为现在全世界上大多数的人类都是受难者，只有斯大林指示的方向，只有斯大林的援助，才能解脱人类的灾难。
    我们中国人民，是处在历史上灾难最深重的时候，是需要人们援助最迫切的时候。诗经上说的：“嘤其鸣矣，求其友声。”我们正是处在这种时候。
    但是，谁是我们的朋友呢？
    一类所谓朋友，他们自称是我们的朋友，我们中间有些人也不加以思索地称他们做朋友。但是这种朋友，只能属于唐朝的李林甫一类，李林甫是唐朝的宰相，是一个有名的被称为“口蜜腹剑”的人。现在这些“朋友”，也正是“口蜜腹剑”的朋友。这些人是谁呢？就是一部分口唤同情中国的帝国主义者。
    另一类朋友则不然，他们是拿真正的同情给我们的，他们是把我们当做弟兄看待的。这些人是谁呢？就是苏联人民，就是斯大林。
    没有一个国家把他们在中国的特权废除过，只有苏联是废除了。
    北伐战争时代，一切帝国主义者都反对我们，只有苏联是援助了我们。
    抗战以来，没有一个帝国主义国家的政府真正援助我们，只有苏联是用其大量的人力、物力、财力援助了我们。
    这还不够明白吗？
    中华民族与中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，社会主义的领袖，社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才是真正援助我们的；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。
    斯大林是中华民族中国人民解放事业的忠实的朋友。中国人民对于斯大林的敬爱，对于苏联的友谊，是完全出于诚意的，任何人的挑拨离间，造谣污蔑，到底都没有用处。
　　在延安各界庆祝斯大林六十寿辰大会上的讲话
    （一九三九年十二月二十一日）毛泽东
    今天开大会，庆祝斯大林同志的六十大寿。“人生七十古来稀”，世间六十岁也是难得的。但是我们为什么单单庆祝斯大林呢？而且这样的庆祝，不仅在延安，而且在全国，而且在全世界，只要晓得他今天生日的人，只要懂得他为人的，只要是受压迫的，都会庆祝他。原因就在于斯大林同志是一切被压迫者的救星。那些人是反对庆祝他、不喜欢庆祝他的呢？这就是自己不受压迫单单压迫他人的人，首先是帝国主义者。同志们！一个外国人，相隔万余里，大家庆祝他的生日，这还是破天荒第一回呢。
    这就是因为他领导着伟大的苏联，因为他领导着伟大的共产国际，因为他领导着全人类的解放运动，帮助中国打日本。
    现在世界上分为两条斗争的阵线，一方面是帝国主义，这是压迫人的阵线；一方面是社会主义，这是反抗压迫的阵线。殖民地半殖民地的民族革命阵线，有些人觉得好象是站在中间，但是它的对头，是帝国主义，它就不能不引社会主义为朋友，不能不属于反抗压迫者的革命阵线的一面。中国的顽固分子，又想做婊子，又想立牌坊，一只手反共，一只手抗日，自称是中间派，但他们终久不成功的，如果不悔过，最后必要走向反革命方面去。革命与反革命的两个阵线，都要有一个作主的，都要有一个指挥官。反革命阵线的指挥官是谁呢？就是帝国主义，就是张伯伦。革命阵线中的指挥官是谁呢？就是社会主义，就是斯大林。斯大林同志是世界革命的领导者。这是一个非常重要的事情，在全人类中间，出了这位斯大林，这是一件大事：有了他，事情就好办了。你们知道，马克思是死了，恩格斯也死了，列宁也死了，如果没有一个斯大林，那一个来发号施令呢？这真是幸事，现在世界上有了一个苏联，有了一个共产党，又有了一个斯大林，这世界的事情就好办了。革命指挥官干些什么事？使人人有饭吃，有衣穿，有屋住，有书读。而要这样，就要领导十几万万人向压迫者作斗争，而使之得到最后的胜利，这就是斯大林要办的事。既然这样，那么，一切被压迫的人们，要不要庆祝斯大林呢？我想是要的，是应该的。我们要庆祝他，拥护他，还要学习他。
    我们要学习他的两个方面，一个是道理方面，一个是事业方面。
    马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：“造反有理。”几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。这是一个大功劳。这个道理是无产阶级从斗争中得来的，而马克思作了结论。根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。斯大林同志有什么功劳呢？他发挥了这个道理，发挥了马克思列宁主义，为全世界被压迫的人民，弄出一篇很清楚很具体很生动的道理来，这就是建立革命阵线，推翻帝国主义，推翻资本主义，建立社会主义社会的整个理论。
    事业方面，是把道理见之实际。关于建设社会主义的事业，马克思、恩格斯、列宁都没有完成，而斯大林把它完成了，这是开天辟地的大事。在苏联的两个五年计划之前，各国资产阶级的报纸，天天说苏联不得了，社会主义是靠不住的，但是在今天怎么样呢？把张伯伦的口都封住了，把中国那些顽固派的口也封住了，他们也都承认苏联是胜利了。
    斯大林除在道理方面帮助了我们的抗日战争外，他还给了我们事业上即物质上的帮助。由于斯大林事业的胜利，他帮助了我们很多的飞机、大炮、航空员，各战区里的军事顾问，还有借款。世界上还有那一个国家这样地帮助我们？世界上还有那一个阶级那一个党那一个人所领导的国家，这样帮助我们呢？除了苏联，除了无产阶级，除了共产党，除了斯大林，还有谁呢？
    现在有些人，他们自称是我们的朋友，但他们只能是属于唐朝李林甫一类的人物。这位李林甫先生，是个“口蜜腹剑”的人。帝国主义者都是口蜜腹剑的，张伯伦就是现在的李林甫。各国在中国的一切特权，什么驻军权、领事裁判权、治外法权等等，那一个帝国主义废除了呢？没有一个。只有苏联是废除了。
    在过去，马克思列宁主义，在理论上指导世界革命。现在加了一点东西，可以在物质上帮助世界革命了，这就是斯大林的大功劳。
    我们庆祝斯大林同志生日之后，还应该把这件事向全国宣传，向四万万五千万人讲清楚，使中国人民都懂得：只有社会主义的苏联，只有斯大林，才是我们中国的好朋友。
