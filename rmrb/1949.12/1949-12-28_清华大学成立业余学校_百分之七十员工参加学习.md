　　Tsinghua University Establishes Spare-Time School
　　Seventy Percent of Staff Participate in Learning
　　[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Tsinghua University Employee Spare-Time School began classes on the 19th of this month. More than 300 people are participating in the learning, accounting for more than 70% of the entire school's staff. They are divided into higher, middle, and lower levels, as well as literacy classes. The higher level is equivalent to junior high school, the middle and lower levels are equivalent to upper and lower elementary school, and those who are illiterate are placed in literacy classes. The classes are divided into groups according to work departments. Teachers are hired from members of the Teachers' Union, the Housewives' Association, and the Student Union. Funding is provided by donations from various groups within the university. To solve the funding difficulties, the students have taken the initiative to help build the school. Li Changlu and four others turned two tons of coal dust donated by Tsinghua University into coal balls, which solved the problem of heating the classrooms.

　　清华大学成立业余学校
　  百分之七十员工参加学习
    【本报讯】清华大学员工业余学校于本月十九日开始上课。三百余人参加学习，占全校员工百分之七十以上。分高、中、初及识字班，高班是初中程度，中、初班是高小、初小程度，不识字的则编入识字班。班内按工作部门分成小组，教员由教联会、家庭妇女会、学生会聘请会员担任。经费由校内各团体捐助，为了解决经费的困难，学员曾自己动手帮助建校，李长禄等五人把清华校方赠给的二吨煤末摇成煤球，这样就解决了教室的取暖问题。
