　　Shijiazhuang People's Education Center
　　It has become the leading core of the city's people's amateur learning and cultural entertainment. It has created a set of methods that combine propaganda policies with the requirements of the citizens. It does not "guard the hall and wait for people to come," but actively attracts and organizes citizens, which is the basic reason for the booming business.
　　The Shijiazhuang People's Education Center was established in December 1947. In nearly two years, it has grown from small to large, from simple to perfect, and has developed into the leading core of the city's people's amateur learning and cultural entertainment, and has made a deep impression on the people of the city. There are many achievements and experiences in the work. A summary is now introduced for reference in various places.
　　(1) Exhibitions
　　In conjunction with the central tasks or anniversaries of various periods, the People's Education Center often holds exhibitions. The exhibits are cartoons, photos, models, physical objects, and various charts. In the first half of this year, more than 20 exhibitions were held, including "February 7th," "April 4th," "May 4th," public security, hygiene, industry, and production competitions. The daily audience is about three to four thousand people. On New Year's Day this year, it reached more than 13,000 people. Each exhibition has great educational significance for the people. For example, during the public security exhibition, many people saw various evidences of the special agents' crimes and said: "In the past, I only talked about the activities of the special agents, and I didn't quite believe it, but now I know that they are so vicious, and I must pay attention in the future." After seeing the actual evidence of the special agents' activities when the Chiang bandits bombed Shijiazhuang, everyone felt the harm of the special agents to themselves and became vigilant. During the hygiene exhibition, the masses saw bacteria on the legs of flies and in cold water under the microscope. Many people said: "In the past, I only knew that drinking cold water would cause stomach pain, but I didn't know that this thing was causing trouble. In the future, I have to boil the water before drinking it." Many women paid great attention to hitting flies after seeing it. After seeing the pictures of how to have children, women publicized it everywhere, and asked other women to take a look, and even housewives who never went out were attracted to visit. During the industrial exhibition, rural cadres in the suburbs said after seeing the machines: "It is impossible to change from an agricultural country to an industrial country without this. The city is more advanced than the countryside in this regard, and we must have more contact in the future." The workers were encouraged when they saw the machines and products they made, and they raised their production enthusiasm and set off a production competition. Some workers and factory owners of private factories also asked the People's Education Center to exhibit the machines and products in their factories. It shows that these physical objects and picture exhibitions are most welcomed and easily accepted by the broad masses of people. This kind of exhibition is not only held in the museum, but the People's Education Center also promotes it to streets, markets, and also sends it to factories, schools, and troops for exhibition, thus attracting the troops to send their photos, and the schools to send their students' achievements to the People's Education Center for exhibition, which further enriches the content of the exhibition. In addition, the People's Education Center has established mutual exchange of exhibits with the People's Cultural Centers in Zhengding, Huolu, Zhao County, Luancheng, Taiyuan, Cang County, and Xinji, making the content of the exhibition richer.
　　(2) Lectures and Symposiums
　　In order to promptly publicize current affairs policies to the citizens, the People's Education Center often holds various lectures and symposiums based on the development of the situation and the current central work. In the first half of the year, a total of 43 lectures were held on labor movement, commerce, people's congress, and marriage issues. The number of listeners was at least more than 300, generally six or seven hundred people. In the one about the people's congress, the lecture room could only accommodate more than 700 people, and as a result, more than 1,000 people came. They had to install amplifiers and hang up loudspeakers, and hundreds of people stood outside to listen. This is a good propaganda method to educate the masses and implement policies. It can explain in a very profound and detailed way so that the masses can understand thoroughly. For example, when talking about marriage issues, the masses raised more than 20 questions after the lecture. The People's Education Center answered them on the blackboard newspaper continuously. Within a week, three to four thousand people came to see the answers on the blackboard newspaper. To hold such lectures, it is necessary to understand the ideological situation of the masses, and the issues discussed must be related to the daily life of the masses. For example, when holding a lecture on economic policies, they made inquiries beforehand, and the topic was "How do industrial and commercial people make money?" The industrial and commercial people came very enthusiastically, and after listening to the lecture, they were all satisfied and said: "This shows which way to go." The lecture time should not be too long, and each time should be based on two hours. In order not to affect production, it is best to hold it at night. In order to conduct it purposefully and with specific objects, in addition to generally advertising to call for people to come and listen, admission tickets can also be issued. For example, when talking about labor movement, admission tickets were sent to the trade unions of factories, and workers were invited to listen. Before and after the lecture, some meaningful entertainment programs are combined, which can better enliven the atmosphere and attract the masses. The symposium is a propaganda method to collect the opinions of the masses and explain the policies and laws in more detail. The People's Education Center can conduct one every week based on the current central work. For example, after the municipal government announced the sanitation regulations for the bathing industry, the People's Education Center held a symposium on the bathing industry. At the meeting, everyone reviewed many of their own shortcomings and put forward some opinions. The comrades of the People's Education Center gave sincere explanations, and as a result, this regulation was implemented very well.
　　(3) Reading of Books and Newspapers
　　The People's Education Center has a library and reading room in the center, and also added a reading room with books about the Soviet Union. It has more than 20,000 books, 34 kinds of newspapers, and more than 120 kinds of magazines for citizens to read. Most of the books are popular readings and ordinary books, but there are also some books for research and reference in various subjects. In order to help citizens read newspapers, it publishes a summary of important news every day, publishes some important news, answers questions for readers, and organizes symposiums and discussions to make readers feel interested. Therefore, the number of readers in the People's Education Center is very large. According to the calculation in June, the average is about 600 people per day. In the first half of the year, more than 800 people obtained the book borrowing certificate from the People's Education Center, of which workers and shop assistants accounted for more than a quarter, a large increase compared with last year. In order to promote the reading of books and newspapers more widely, the People's Education Center also set up a reading and borrowing office in the People's Park and Jiefang Avenue, and organized 24 book and newspaper borrowing offices. In order to facilitate the reading of activists, readers are organized in factories and groups. Anyone over 30 can apply for registration to establish a borrowing office. The borrowing office borrows books from the People's Education Center in a unified manner (large ones borrow more than 100 books each time, and small ones borrow 30 to 40 books each time), and changes them once a month, thus sending books and newspapers to every corner of the city and educating the broad masses of citizens. For example, a shop assistant read more than 40 books in a year; a photographer read more than 30 books in a year, and his thinking improved, and he was admitted to the training class and participated in revolutionary work. A woman actively looked for a job after reading some books. In order to read books in a more organized way, the People's Education Center has begun to organize reading clubs.
　　(4) Broadcasting
　　The People's Education Center uses the city's electricity to set up wired broadcasting and installed 19 loudspeakers on the major streets of Qiaoxi. It broadcasts to the citizens twice a day, day and night. The programs include current affairs news, local news, market trends, local market conditions, special reports, question answering, music records, and entertainment programs for workers and students on Saturdays and Sundays. On anniversaries or when major central work arrives, responsible comrades are invited to broadcast speeches. Every time the broadcast time comes, there are two to three hundred people listening in front of each loudspeaker. When Shijiazhuang held the People's Congress in July, it rebroadcasted the live broadcast of the conference, and the citizens could hear the conference report and speeches on the street. Everyone was very concerned. When the opening ceremony of the CPPCC was broadcast and Mao Zedong's opening speech was recorded, there were more than 1,000 people listening in front of the two loudspeakers on Chaoyang Road. After listening, they rejoiced, which had a great educational effect on the masses. The citizens living in Qiaodong also requested to install loudspeakers in Qiaodong, and put forward proposals at the People's Congress, but it is still very difficult due to the limitations of electricity and machinery. Now the museum plans to set up a small broadcasting machine in order to overcome this difficulty and meet the requirements of the citizens, so that it can broadcast the daily programs to the countryside within 20 miles.
　　(5) Social Services
　　In order to closely relate to the masses, the People's Education Center also did several things needed by the masses:
　　1. Information Office: Divided into oral and written types. There are special personnel to answer oral inquiries. The People's Education Center has information records and answer records for written inquiries. General small questions are answered in the answer records. If there are general questions, they are also published on the blackboard newspaper or newspaper. Some farmers come to the city to buy things and also run to ask which company's things are good. It is very convenient for the people, and at the same time, the People's Education Center also educates the people.
　　2. Opinion Box: A total of 11 opinion boxes are set up in the city, which are opened every three days to collect the opinions of the masses on all aspects and send them to the relevant departments for reference. In the first half of the year, more than 200 constructive opinions from the citizens were collected through this method, such as building and expanding spare-time supplementary study, repairing the stadium, opposing unscrupulous merchants hoarding grain, asking the government to stabilize prices, and finding ways to resettle beggars, etc., which are very helpful to the government.
　　3. Job Introduction: From March to the end of June, jobs were introduced to more than 40 people, so that various agencies and groups could find the personnel they needed, and so that job seekers could find suitable jobs.
　　(6) Sports Activities
　　In order to promote the people's sports activities, the People's Education Center began to hold Sunday ball games in the summer and organized more than 20 basketball and volleyball teams for workers, citizens, students, and cadres. Each competition attracted many visitors. One time, the statistics reached more than 900 people. In order to popularize sports, a large-scale sports meeting was organized, attracting workers, students, farmers in the suburbs, troops, and staff from agencies to participate. The performance items included not only individual performances but also collective performances, and even farmers performed cart pushing, shoulder pole walking, and grass cutting competitions. In addition, a baby health competition was held. More than 270 children participated in the competition, of which the children of working people accounted for about 50%. These greatly increased the citizens' interest in sports.
　　(7) Several Experiences
　　The experiences of the museum in achieving these achievements can be summarized as follows:
　　1. The leadership attaches importance to the People's Education Center, regards it as one of the main forces in propaganda and education work, improves the organization, equips appropriate cadres, solves the necessary funds, and regularly gives political education.
　　2. The comrades of the People's Education Center are enthusiastic and willing to work, put down their airs, approach the masses, and think about the masses everywhere. They open the museum on the first day of the Lunar New Year, work for 10 hours on weekdays, do everything themselves, and can conduct regular research.
　　3. The work can be combined with the central work and can be combined with the needs of the citizens' lives.
　　4. In the work, not only the work in the museum is done well, but also it is promoted to all directions with emphasis, overcoming the old style of the People's Education Center of "guarding the museum and waiting for people to come." The museum tries its best to attract people to come, and at the same time pays attention to sending it to the citizens. Not only does it work with itself as the core, but it also pays attention to organizing the cultural and entertainment work of the masses, thus enabling the work to open up.

　　石家庄的人民教育馆
    它已成为全市人民业余学习与文化娱乐的领导核心。创造了一套宣传政策与市民要求结合的方法。不是“死守馆内等人来”，而是主动吸引与组织市民，这就是业务蒸蒸日上的基本原因。
    石家庄的人民教育馆，成立于一九四七年十二月。在将近两年的期间，已由小而大，由简陋而完善，发展成为全市人民业余学习和文化娱乐的领导核心，在全市人民中有了很深的印象。工作中有很多成绩和经验，兹摘要介绍，供各地参考。
    （一）展览
    结合着各个时期的中心工作或纪念日，民教馆经常举办展览。展览的物品为漫画、照片、模型、实物和各种图表。今年上半年共举行了“二七”、“四四”、“五四”，治安、卫生、工业、生产竞赛等二十余次。每天观众均在三四千人左右，今年元旦一天竟达一万三千余人。每次展览对人民都有很大教育意义，如在进行治安展览时，许多人看了特务罪行的各种证据说：“过去光说特务活动，我还有些不信，现在才知道他们真是这样恶毒，今后可得注意哩。”大家看了蒋匪轰炸石家庄时特务活动的实证后都感到特务对自己的危害而警惕起来。在举办卫生展览时，群众从显微镜里看到苍蝇腿上和凉水里的细菌，有许多群众说：“过去光知道凉水渴上要肚痛，可不知道是这东西在作怪，以后可得把水煮开才行。”有不少妇女看了后非常注意打蝇子。妇女们看到怎样生养孩子的图画后，到处宣传，叫别的妇女去看一看，连一向不出门的家庭妇女也被吸引去参观了。在工业展览时，郊区农村干部看了机器后说：“由农业国变工业国，离了这个可不行，城市在这方面比乡村就是进步，以后得多多联系。”工人看到自己制的机器和产品，受到鼓励，提高了生产情绪，掀起了生产竞赛，有些私营厂的工人和厂主也要求民教馆展览他们厂里的机器和产品。说明这些实物和图画的展览是最为广大群众所欢迎而易于接受的。这种展览不仅在馆内举办，民教馆更把它推广街头、集市，并且还送到工厂、学校、部队里去展览，因而吸引了部队把自己的照片，学校把学生的成绩，送到民教馆展览，更丰富了展览内容。此外民教馆与正定、获鹿、赵县、栾城、太原、沧县、辛集人民文化馆建立互相交换展览品的关系，使展览内容更加丰富。
    （二）讲座和座谈
    为了及时对市民宣传时事政策，民教馆根据形势发展和当前中心工作，经常举办各种讲座和座谈。上半年共举办了工运，商业，人代会，婚姻问题等讲座四十三次。听取人数，最少三百多人，一般为六、七百人，讲人代会的一次，讲室只能容七百多人，结果到了一千几百人，只好按上扩音器，挂上喇叭，几百人站在外边听。这是一种教育群众贯彻政策的良好宣传方法，可以很深刻细致的讲解，使群众了解透澈。如在讲婚姻问题时，讲后群众又提出二十多个问题来，民教馆在黑板报连续解答，一周之内，来看黑板报解答的就有三四千人。举办这种讲座必须了解群众思想情况，讲的问题必须与群众切身生活有联系，如在一次举办经济政策讲座时，事前作了了解，讲题为“工商业者怎样赚钱？”工商业者来的非常踊跃，听了讲后都满意的说：“这可知道该往那条道上走了。”讲座时间不宜过长，每次以两小时为准，为了不影响生产，夜间举办为最好。为了有目的有对象的进行，除了一般出广告号召来听外还可以发入场券，如在讲工运时，就曾向工厂的工会送入场券，请工人来听。在讲前讲后配合一些有意义的娱乐节目，更能活跃情绪，吸引群众。座谈会是收集群众思想意见，更详细的解释政策法令的宣传方法，民教馆每周都能根据当前中心工作进行一次。如市政府公布了沐浴业卫生条例，民教馆便召开了一个沐浴待业座谈会，会上大家检讨了不少本身缺点，同时提出一些意见，民教馆的同志作了恳切解释，结果这个条例就执行得很好。
    （三）书报阅览
    民教馆在馆内设有图书室、阅报室，还增辟了有关苏联介绍书籍的阅览室，已设备有二万余册书，三十四种报纸，一百二十来种杂志，供给市民阅览。书籍大部为通俗读物和普通书籍，但也有一些可供研究参考的各科用书。为了帮助市民读报，每天公布要闻索引，并把某些重要新闻公布，并为读者解答疑问，组织座谈讨论，使读者感到兴趣，因而，民教馆的阅览人数是很多的。据六月份计算，平均每天在六百人左右。取得民教馆向外借阅书证的上半年达八百多人，其中工人店员占到四分之一以上，较去年大增。为了把书报更广泛的推广阅览，民教馆又在人民公园和解放大街各设一个阅览借处，组织了二十四个书报代借处。为便于阅览的积极分子在工厂、团体中组织读者，凡满三十以上即可申请登记建立代借处，代借处统一向民教馆借书（大的每次借百余册，小的每次三四十册不等），每月换一次，这样把书报送到全市的各个角落，教育了广大市民。如有一个店员一年看了四十多本书；一个照像馆馆员一年中看了三十多本书，思想进步了，考入训练班，参加了革命工作。一个妇女看了些书后，积极找工作做。为了更有组织的读书，民教馆已开始组织读书会。
    （四）广播
    民教馆利用城市有电的条件， 设置了有线电广播、 在桥西各大街安设了十九个喇叭。每天日夜两次向市民广播，节目有时事新闻，本市消息，市场动态，各地行情，专题报告，问题解答，音乐唱片，星期六和星期日并组织工人学生的文娱节目。每逢纪念日或大的中心工作到来时请负责同志广播讲演。每逢广播时间，每个喇叭前都有二三百人来听。七月石家庄开人代会时转播了大会实况，市民在街头就能听到大会报告和发言。大家非常关心。当政协开幕放送毛主席开幕词录音时，朝阳路上两个喇叭前共有上千人在听，听后狂欢，对群众鼓舞教育作用很大。桥东住的市民也要求在桥东按设喇叭，并在人代会上提出提案，但因电力和机器限制还很困难，现该馆为克服这个困难满足市民要求，拟设一个小广播机，这样就能把每天所播节目放送到二十里以内的农村。
    （五）社会服务
    民教馆为了密切与群众关系，还作了几项为群众所需要的工作：
    一、问事处：分口头书面两种，口头询问有专人解答，书面的民教馆设有问事录和答事录，一般小问题即在答事录上回答，遇到带有一般性的问题还在黑板报或报纸上发表。有的农民进城买东西，也跑来问谁家的东西好。对人民有许多方便，同时民教馆也对人民群众进行了教育。
    二、意见箱：全市共设十一个意见箱，每三天开一次，收集群众对各方面意见，送有关部门参考，前半年通过这种方式搜集了市民二百多条建设性的意见，如建设扩大业余补习学习，修体育场，反对奸商囤积粮食，请政府平抑物价，设法安置乞丐等，对政府很有帮助。
    三、职业介绍：从三月到六月底给四十多个人介绍了职业，使各机关团体能找到需要的人员，使谋业者能找到适当的工作。
    （六）体育活动
    为了提倡人民的体育活动，民教馆从夏天开始举办星期球赛，组织了工人、市民、学生、干部等二十多队篮球排球队，每次比赛参观者都很多，有一次统计竟达九百余人。为了把体育大众化，组织了大规模的体育会，吸收工人、学生、郊区农民、部队、机关人员参加，表演项目不但有个人表演更着重的是集体表演，甚至农民表演推车，挑担竞走铡草比赛。此外还举办了婴儿健康比赛，参加比赛的儿童有二百七十余名，其中劳动人民的子女占百分之五十左右，这些都大大提高了市民对体育的兴趣。
    （七）几点经验
    该馆能以取得这些成绩的经验，总括有以下几点：
    一、领导上对人民教育馆重视，看作是宣教工作主力之一，健全了机构，配备了适当干部，解决了必须经费，并经常的给以政治教育。
    二、民教馆工作同志热心肯干，放下架子，接近群众，处处为群众着想，他们在大年初一开馆，平日工作达十小时，一切事情都亲自动手，能经常研究。
    三、工作能与中心工作结合，能与市民生活需要结合。
    四、工作中既作好了馆内工作；又能有重点的向四面八方推广，克服了旧日民教馆“死守馆内等人来”的作风。馆内作到尽可能吸引人来，同时注意到向市民中去送。不但以自己为核心进行工作，并且注意了组织群众的文化娱乐工作，因而使工作得以打开局面。
