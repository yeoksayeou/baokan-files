Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st: TASS Moscow, December 21st: The congratulatory message from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics to Stalin is as follows:

    Dear Comrade Stalin! On your glorious seventieth birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR extends warm congratulations to you—the great leader of the Soviet people and the outstanding leader of the Soviet socialist state.

    You have dedicated more than fifty years of your life to the struggle for the victory of communism. Together with Lenin, you established our heroic, Bolshevik Communist Party, a new type of party, a party of socialist revolution.

    Together with Lenin, at the forefront of the Bolshevik Party, you led the Russian working class and all the working masses of our motherland to achieve the victory of the Great October Revolution. Together with Lenin, you founded the multi-ethnic Soviet state—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is a living embodiment of the fraternal friendship of all nations and represents a system of state organization in which the national question and the cooperation of all nations have been resolved in a way that cannot be resolved in any capitalist country.

    After Lenin's death, you united the Party around the Leninist Central Committee and mobilized the people's strength to continue the struggle for the complete victory of socialism in our country. In the new historical era, you, Comrade Stalin, developed and enriched Leninism. You extensively enriched Lenin's doctrine on the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country, opening up vast prospects for our people to build a communist society in the context of capitalist encirclement.

    Under your leadership, the Bolshevik Party crushed the mortal enemies of the people who had attempted to hinder the people's progress towards socialism and cast them into the dustbin of history.

    Under your leadership, the construction of a socialist society has been realized in our country, and profound, epoch-making changes have taken place, fundamentally changing the economic, social, and spiritual aspects of our motherland. In a short historical period, the Soviet Union has transformed from an agricultural, backward country into a powerful industrial nation in the world. Through the victory of the collective farm system, tens of millions of small farmers have embarked on the road of large-scale socialist agriculture.

    You are the author of the fundamental law of the Soviet socialist state, which our people rightly call the Stalin Constitution, because it is the codification of the great victories won by the Soviet people under your leadership. In this most democratic Soviet state in the world, the exploiting classes have been abolished forever, and the exploitation of man by man has been ended. In the Soviet Union, the individual has been liberated from all the shackles of economic, political, and national oppression, and the people enjoy the benefits of the socialist system, which knows no crises or unemployment and guarantees the continuous improvement of the material and cultural levels of all working people. The Stalin Constitution has spiritually and politically armed our people to fight for the complete victory of communism.

    In the Great Patriotic War, you demonstrated yourself to be a genius military strategist and the greatest military leader the world has ever known. In the face of mortal danger, you united the Soviet people to fight against the treacherous enemy. Under your name, which symbolizes ardent Soviet patriotism and boundless confidence in the victory of our just cause, the heroic Soviet army broke the spine of the Hitlerite beast, drove it out of the sacred borders of our motherland, and finished it off in its own lair.

    Under your leadership, our country, in the shortest possible time, restored and surpassed the pre-war level of national economic development, greatly improved the material life of the people, and further strengthened its military and economic might.

    The Soviet people, carrying out your instructions on organizing a new and powerful advance in the national economy, are confidently and victoriously continuing the gradual transition from socialism to communism, which was interrupted by the war.

    Under your leadership, the Soviet Union has launched a resolute struggle against the warmongers and for peace throughout the world. It stands at the forefront of the anti-imperialist camp—the camp of socialism and democracy. Your wise and consistent policy has enhanced the international authority of the Soviet Union and strengthened the Soviet Union as a bastion of peace and international security.

    Your brilliant leadership is the source of guidance and organization, the source of spiritual strength in our country. All the achievements of the Soviet people, which have epoch-making significance, are inseparable from your name. Your name is the banner of struggle and the symbol of our victory, it symbolizes the solidarity of all the forces of Soviet socialist society.

    The hopes and aspirations of all honest, freedom-loving people throughout the world in their struggle against exploitation and oppression and for the happy future of all nations are linked to your name.

    Your entire selfless, comprehensive, and noble activity has earned you the love, the deepest respect, and the boundless gratitude of all the peoples of the Soviet Union and of advanced and progressive humanity throughout the world.

    On your glorious seventieth birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics, noting your extraordinary contributions to the Soviet people and the socialist state, expresses to you the love and gratitude of all the Soviet people, and extends to you—our great leader, teacher, and friend—the highest respect, warmly wishing you longevity and long years of work for the happiness and well-being of all the peoples of the Soviet Union.

            The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics (Signed)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st: TASS Moscow, December 21st: The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Council of Ministers to Stalin is as follows:

To Comrade Stalin—the great leader and teacher, the successor to Lenin's immortal cause, dear friend, comrade-in-arms, teacher, and leader!

On your seventieth birthday, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the Council Ministers of the Soviet Union extend congratulations to you—Lenin's great comrade-in-arms and friend, the brilliant successor to his immortal cause, the tireless builder of communism, our wise teacher and leader.

Comrade Stalin, you and Lenin together built the Bolshevik Party, and in close comradely friendship with Lenin, laid the ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical foundations of Bolshevism, tempered the Party in the fierce struggle for the liberation of the working class, making it the most powerful revolutionary party in the world. You—a fearless, revolutionary, brilliant theorist, a great organizer—together with Lenin, confidently, bravely, unflinchingly, and prudently led the Party and the working class in armed uprisings and socialist revolution.

Comrade Stalin, you and Lenin were the soul and leaders of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the creators of the world's first worker and peasant Soviet socialist state.

During the years of civil war and foreign intervention, your genius for organization and military leadership enabled the Soviet people and their heroic Red Army to defeat the enemies of the motherland and achieve victory. Under your direct leadership, Comrade Stalin, the great work of establishing national Soviet republics was realized, uniting them into a federal state—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

After death took the life of the great Lenin, Comrade Stalin, you held high Lenin's glorious banner, bravely and resolutely leading our Party forward along the path of Leninism. The Bolshevik Party, strong in its loyalty to Leninism, pioneered a new path in history—the path of building socialism in a country surrounded by capitalist states.

The theory of Lenin on the possibility of the victory of socialism in our country, which was developed and enriched by you, Comrade Stalin, is of the greatest significance for the victory of socialism.

The enemies of socialism, the enemies of the Soviet people and the Communist Party, tried in vain to divert our Party from the path of Leninism-Stalinism, to split the Party from within, and to deprive the working class of its confidence in its own strength and in the possibility of building socialism. You irreconcilably exposed the vile and criminal attempts of the enemies of the people to ideologically disarm the Party, undermine its unity, and destroy the Soviet regime and the socialist revolution. In the fierce struggle against traitors and socialist betrayers, against Trotskyites, Bukharinites, bourgeois nationalists, and other enemies, Comrade Stalin, the leading core of our Party was formed around you, holding high the invincible banner of Lenin, uniting the ranks of the Communist Party, and leading the Soviet people onto the great road of building socialism.

Carrying out the grand plan for the socialist industrialization of our country formulated by you, the Soviet people transformed technically and economically backward Russia into an advanced industrial country in an unprecedentedly short period of time. The great socialist construction projects of the several Five-Year Plans, which played a decisive role in strengthening our country's defense capabilities, and the huge industries and new sectors of industry, are inseparable from your name.

Comrade Stalin, under your wise leadership, the countryside underwent a historic transformation in 1929, the consequences of which were equivalent to the revolutionary upheavals of 1917. The Communist Party implemented a strong collectivization of agriculture and, on this basis, eliminated the kulak class. As a result of the victory of the collective farm system and the mechanization of agriculture, a new socialist life has firmly taken root in the Soviet countryside. This new life has freed the peasants from bondage, bankruptcy, and poverty.

Under the leadership of our Party, headed by the beloved Stalin, the Soviet Union has become a powerful industrial and collective agricultural country, a victorious socialist country. The Soviet people, who have built socialism, have forever eliminated the exploitation of man by man, established a new social and state system without crises and unemployment, which guarantees the improvement of the material and cultural levels of the working people. The Soviet Constitution, rightly called the Stalin Constitution by the people, consolidates the great victory of socialism and has become a magnet and indicator for all of working humanity.

Drawing on the richest experience gained by the Soviet state, you, Comrade Stalin, developed a flawless doctrine of the socialist state. You developed Leninism, drawing the brilliant conclusion that in the continued existence of capitalist encirclement, the construction of communism in our country is possible, and that the state must be maintained even under communism. This conclusion provides the Party and the people with a clear vision for the struggle for the victory of communism.

Comrade Stalin, your name is inseparable from the solution of a major revolutionary issue—the national question.

In the fraternal family of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, formerly oppressed nations have achieved unprecedented political, economic, and cultural progress. The friendship of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, inspired by you, is a great achievement of the revolution and one of the sources of the power of our socialist motherland. With the victory of socialism, the Soviet people, closely united around the Party of Lenin and Stalin, have become indestructible in their spiritual and political unity. Our people are filled with ardent and vigorous Soviet patriotism.

Under your leadership, the Bolshevik Party has completed a true cultural revolution in the Soviet Union.

You have poured your wisdom, invincible energy, and iron will into every change, great or small, that has made our motherland rise endlessly higher. The great Stalin, as the leader of our Party and state, guides and encourages the creative and constructive efforts of the Soviet people to move towards the prosperity of our glorious country, which is our good fortune, the good fortune of our people. Comrade Stalin, under your leadership, the Soviet Union has become a great and invincible force.

When Hitlerite Germany launched a war against the Soviet Union, and great danger enveloped our motherland, Comrade Stalin, you led the Soviet people in armed struggle against the mortal enemy of mankind—fascism, calling on all Soviet men and women to participate in the Great Patriotic War, encouraging the Soviet people and their armed forces to perform great deeds. The Party of Lenin and Stalin unified the efforts of the front and the rear. Your military and organizational genius enabled us to defeat fascist Germany and capitalist Japan.

The great military leader and organizer of victory, Comrade Stalin, you created advanced Soviet military science. In the campaigns led by you, outstanding examples of the art of military operations and strategy were demonstrated. The first-rate military cadres you cultivated gloriously fulfilled the Stalin plan to defeat the enemy. All honest people in the world, all people of future generations, will give glory to the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, and see you as the savior who saved world civilization from the ravages of fascist barbarians.

In the post-war situation, guided by your instructions, the entire Soviet people focused their creative initiative on eliminating the consequences of the war, on the realization of huge plans for the further development of the national economy and the culture of the socialist state, and on improving the welfare of the people. The ideas of Lenin and Stalin on socialist competition inspired Soviet patriots to create new labor achievements, and this idea has awakened great energy in the hearts of hundreds of millions of Soviet people under the great goal of the victory of communism. Comrade Stalin, with the greatest firmness and foresight, you guide the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, fighting for peace and the security of large and small countries. The authority enjoyed by the Soviet Union as a bastion of peace and democracy in the international arena has grown immeasurably. The workers of capitalist countries and colonial countries see you as a sincere and resolute fighter for peace and a defender of the vital interests of all the world's peoples. You have ignited in the hearts of all ordinary people in the world an unwavering belief in the just cause of the struggle for world peace, the struggle for national independence of all nations, and the struggle for friendship between nations.

Comrade Stalin, under your leadership, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the liberation of the working people of the people's democratic countries from the fascist enslavers and from the shackles of capitalists and landlords. The people of these countries, filled with gratitude to you for the selfless and fraternal assistance given by the Soviet Union in economic and cultural development.

The great master of science! Your classic works have developed Marxism-Leninism as applied to the new era—the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, the era of the victory of socialism in our country, and these works have become the greatest wealth of mankind, an encyclopedia of revolutionary Marxism. The Soviet people and the advanced representatives of the working people of all countries have drawn knowledge, confidence, and new strength from these works in the struggle for the cause of the working class, and they have found in these works answers to some of the most urgent questions of the current struggle for communism. Your works on the national question in colonial countries shine like a bright torch illuminating the path of the national liberation movement of the peoples of colonial and dependent countries. Inspired by the revolutionary ideas of Lenin and Stalin, the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism have achieved great victories.

The great builder of communism! You educate all Bolshevik Party members to strictly demand from themselves and others, to bravely criticize shortcomings, and you warn them that one must never be satisfied with the achievements already made and must not let victory go to one's head. You teach us that criticism and self-criticism are effective weapons in the struggle for communism. You teach us that Bolshevik humility and a caring attitude towards the needs of the people, adhering to Bolshevik ideas and principles in the struggle against any manifestation of bourgeois ideology, must be indispensable qualities of Party and Soviet cadres.

Dear Comrade Stalin! You constantly teach us Bolsheviks to emulate the great Lenin, to spare no effort to serve our people, to do everything possible to further improve our beloved motherland, and to do everything for the victory of communism. The Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people, and all progressive humanity regard you as the teacher and leader, the brilliant successor to Lenin's immortal cause. Stalin's name is most precious to our people and to ordinary people all over the world. The name of Stalin is a symbol of the imminent victory of communism. The hearts of the Soviet people and hundreds of millions of workers on earth are filled with ardent love for you, the great Stalin!

It is a great happiness to be able to live and work in our Soviet country, to be a member of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, to be in the generation of heroic Soviet people who, under the leadership of Stalin, fought for the victory of communism in the Stalin era!

Our leader and teacher, our best friend and comrade-in-arms, please accept our heartfelt congratulations and wish you good health, longevity, and many years of fruitful work for the benefit of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people, and for the happiness of the working people of the whole world.

Long live our own Stalin!

           The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (Signed)

    亲爱的斯大林同志！在你的光荣的七十寿辰，苏联最高苏维埃主席团向你——苏联人民的伟大领袖、苏维埃社会主义国家的卓越领袖，致热烈的贺忱。
    你把你生命中五十多年的时光献给争取共产主义胜利的斗争。你与列宁一起，建立了我们英雄的、布尔什维克的共产党，一个新型的党，一个社会主义革命的党。
    你与列宁一起，在布尔什维克党的前列，领导俄罗斯工人阶级以及我们祖国的所有劳动群众，取得了伟大十月革命的胜利。你与列宁一起，创立了多民族的苏维埃国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，它是各民族兄弟般友谊的活的体现，并代表着这样一个国家组织的制度，在这个制度中，民族问题和各民族的合作问题已经以在任何资本主义国家中都不能解决的方式得到了解决。
    在列宁逝世后，你使党团结在列宁主义的中央委员会的周围，动员人民的力量为争取社会主义在我们国家中的完全胜利而继续进行斗争。在新的历史时代的情况下，你，斯大林同志，发展和丰富了列宁主义。你广泛地充实了列宁关于社会主义在一个国家中取得胜利可能性的学说，为我们人民打开了在资本主义包围的情况下建立共产主义社会的广大前景。
    在你的领导下，布尔什维克党粉碎了那些曾经企图阻碍人民走向社会主义的人民的死敌，并把他们推进了历史的垃圾堆。
    在你的领导下，社会主义社会的建设在我们国家里实现了，深刻的、划时代的变化发生了，这根本地改变了我们祖国的经济、社会、精神各方面。在短促的历史时间中，苏联已从一个农业的、落后的国家变成了一个世界上的强大的工业国家。通过集体农场制度的胜利，千千万万的小农户走上了大规模社会主义农业的道路。
    你是苏维埃社会主义国家的根本法的作者，我们人民正确地称它为斯大林宪法，因为它是苏联人民在你的领导下所获得的巨大胜利的法典。在这个世界上最民主的苏维埃国家中，剥削阶级已被永远地废除了，人对人的剥削被结束了。在苏联，人的个性已自经济的、政治的及民族的、压迫的一切桎梏中解放了出来，人民享有社会主义制度的利益，这个制度不知道有危机和失业，并保证所有劳动人民在物质和文化水平上的不断的提高。斯大林宪法在精神上与政治上武装了我们的人民为争取共产主义的完全胜利进行斗争。

    在你的领导下，我们国家在最短促的时间内，恢复并超过了国民经济发展的战前水准，大大地提高了人民的物质生活，并进一步加强了它的军事和经济的威力。
    苏联人民执行您关于组织国民经济新的有力进展的指示，正在满怀信心地与胜利地继续为战争中断的从社会主义到共产主义的逐渐过渡。

    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日民：联共（布）党中央委员会与部长会议致斯大林贺词，原文如下：
    致斯大林同志——伟大的领袖与导师、列宁不朽事业的继承者。亲爱的朋友、战友、导师和领袖！
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会和苏联部长会议在您的七十寿辰，向您——列宁的伟大同事与朋友、他的不朽事业的光辉的继承者，共产主义不疲倦的建设者，我们英明的导师和领袖祝贺。
    斯大林同志，您和列宁一道，建设了布尔什维克党，与列宁在密切的同志情谊中，奠定了布尔什维主义在思想上、组织上、策略上与理论上的基础，在求工人阶级解放的严酷斗争中锻炼了党，使它成为世界上最强有力的革命政党。您——无畏的、革命的、光辉的理论家，伟大的组织者，和列宁一道，满怀信心地、勇敢地、不屈不挠地、谨慎地领导党和工人阶级举行了武装起义，进行了社会主义革命。
    斯大林同志，您和列宁是伟大十月社会主义革命的灵魂和领袖，是世界上第一个工人与农民的苏维埃社会主义国家的缔造的。
    在内战和外国干涉的岁月里，您的组织与军事领导的天才，使苏维埃人民及其英勇的红军，战胜了祖国的敌人，取得了胜利。在您，斯大林同志的直接领导下，实现了建立民族的苏维埃共和国的巨大工作，将它们团结在一个联邦国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟中。
    在死神夺去了伟大列宁的生命之后，斯大林同志，您高举着列宁光荣的旗帜，勇敢地、坚决地领导我们的党沿着列宁主义的道路前进。以忠于列宁主义而强大的布尔什维克党，开拓了历史的新道路——在被资本主义国家包围的国家中建设社会主义的道路。
    为您，斯大林同志所发展和丰富了的列宁关于社会主义可能在我国胜利的理论，对于社会主义的胜利具有最伟大的意义。
    社会主义的敌人，苏维埃人民的与共产党的敌人曾徒劳地企图使我们党脱离列宁主义、斯大林主义的道路，企图从内部分裂党，夺去工人阶级对自己力量、对建设社会主义可能性的信心。您不调和地揭露了人民的敌人在思想上解除党的武装、破坏党的团结、摧毁苏维埃政权和社会主义革命的卑鄙的罪恶的企图。在反对卖国贼和社会主义叛徒，反对托洛斯基分子、布哈林分子、资产阶级民族主义分子和其他敌人的激烈的斗争中，斯大林同志，在您的周围形成了我们党的领导核心，它高高举起无敌的列宁的旗帜，团结了共产党的队伍，将苏维埃人民带上了建设社会主义的大道。
    苏维埃人民执行您所拟订的我国社会主义工业化的宏大计划，在历史上空前短的时期内将技术上与经济上落后的俄罗斯变成了一个先进的工业国家。在加强我国国防力量中起了决定作用的几个五年计划的巨大社会主义建设事业，巨大的工业和工业中新的部门，都是和您的名字分不开的。
    斯大林同志，在您的英明的领导之下，农村在一九二九年发生了历史的转变，其后果相当于一九一七年的革命大变革。共产党实行了坚强的农业集体化，并在这个基础上消灭了富农阶级。由于集体农场制度的胜利和农业机械化的结果，新的社会主义生活业已在苏维埃农村中坚实地扎下了根。这种新生活使农民脱离了束缚、破产和贫困。
    在以亲爱的斯大林为首的我们党的领导下，苏联业已变成强大的工业与集体农业的国家，胜利的社会主义国家。业已建设了社会主义的苏维埃人民，永远消灭了人对人的剥削，建立了新的没有危机和失业的社会与国家制度，这保证了劳动人民物质与文化水平的提高。为人民所正确地称之为斯大林宪法的苏联宪法，巩固了社会主义的伟大胜利，斯大林宪法已经成为全体劳动人类的磁石与指标。
    凭借着苏维埃国家所取得的最丰富的经验，您，斯大林同志发展了完整无瑕的社会主义国家的学说。您发展了列宁主义，作出这样辉煌的结论：在资本主义包围仍然存在的时候，在我国有建设共产主义的可能性，并且在共产主义下仍有保持国家的必要。这个结论给党与人民画出了一个为共产主义胜利而斗争的明确的远景。
    斯大林同志，您的名字是和一个重要的革命问题——民族问题——的解决分不开的。
    在苏维埃各族人民的兄弟般的大家庭中，从前被压迫的民族达到了空前未有的政治、经济和文化的进展。为您所鼓舞的苏联各族人民的友谊，是革命中的伟大收获，是我们社会主义祖国威力的来源之一。伴同着社会主义的胜利，苏维埃人民紧密地团结在列宁、斯大林党的周围，在精神上与政治上的一致，已成为不可摧毁的了。我们的人民充满了热烈的与蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义。
    在您的领导下，布尔什维克党在苏联完成了真正的文化革命。
    您曾把您的智慧、不可征服的精力、钢铁的意志，灌注到每一个或大或小的变化中，这种变化使我们的祖国无止境地向上高升。作为我们党与国家的领袖的伟大的斯大林，指导并鼓励苏维埃人民的创造性和建设性努力，以走向我们光荣国家的繁荣，这是我们的幸运，我们人民的幸运。斯大林同志，在您的领导下，苏联已变成一个伟大的不可战胜的力量。
    当希特勒德国对苏联发动战争，极大的危险笼罩着我们的祖国时，斯大林同志，您领导着苏维埃人民对人类的死敌——法西斯主义进行武装斗争，唤起所有苏维埃男女们来参加伟大的爱国战争，鼓励苏维埃人民和他们的武装部队立下了丰功伟绩。列宁、斯大林的党统一了前后方的努力。您的军事的与组织的天才，使我们战胜了法西斯德国和资本主义日本。
    伟大的军事领袖与胜利的组织者，斯大林同志，您创造了先进的苏维埃军事科学。在您所领导的历次战役中，表现了军事的作战的与战略的艺术的杰出例证。您培养出来的第一等军事干部，光荣地履行了击溃敌人的斯大林计划。世界上所有正直的人民、未来世代的所有人们，将光荣归于苏联和斯大林同志，把您看作是使世界的人民、未来世代的所有人们，将光荣归于苏联和斯大林同志，把您看作是使世界文明免受法西斯野蛮人蹂躏的救星。
    在战后情况下，为您的训示所指导着，全体苏维埃人民把他们的创造的主动性，集中在消除战争后果上，在关于进一步发展国民经济和社会主义国家文化的巨大计划的实现上，在增进人民的福利上。列宁、斯大林关于社会主义竞赛的思想，鼓舞着苏维埃爱国者们创造了新的劳动业绩，这种思想在共产主义胜利的伟大目标下，在亿万苏联人民的心中唤起了伟大的精力。斯大林同志，您以最伟大的坚强与灼见，指导苏联的外交政策，为争取和平与大小国的安全而斗争。苏联作为和平与民主堡垒在国际上所享有的威权，已无可限量地增长。资本主义国家和殖民地国家的劳动者，把您看作是真诚的、坚决的和平战士与所有国家人民切身利益的维护者。您已在世界上所有普通人民的心中，对于争取世界和平的斗争、争取各国人民民族独立的斗争、争取民族间友谊的斗争的正义事业，燃起了不可动摇的信念。
    斯大林同志，在您的领导下，苏联在人民民主国家的劳动人民从法西斯奴役者，从资本家与地主的桎梏下获得解放中，起了决定的作用。由于苏联在经济与文化发展方面所给的无私的兄弟般的帮助，这些国家的人民，对您充满着感激之情。
    伟大的科学泰斗！您的经典的著作发展了应用在新时代——帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代、社会主义在我国胜利的时代的马列主义，您的这些著作成了人类最伟大的财富、革命的马克思主义的百科全书。苏维埃人民和各国劳动人民的先进代表在争取工人阶级事业的斗争中，从这些著作中取得了知识、信心与新的力量，他们从这些著作中找到了目前为共产主义而斗争的一些最急迫的问题的答案。您的关于殖民地民族问题的著作象光辉的火炬一样照耀着殖民地与附属国人民民族解放运动的道路。在列宁、斯大林的革命思想的启发下，和平、民主与社会主义力量取得了巨大的胜利。
    共产主义的伟大缔造者！您教育一切布尔什维克党人要严格的要求自己和别人，要勇敢地批评缺点，您告诫他们，一个人决不可满足于既得的成绩，不能够让胜利冲昏头脑。您教导我们，批评与自我批评是为共产主义而斗争的有效武器。您教导我们，布尔什维克的谦逊以及对人民的需要采取关怀备至的态度，在反对任何资产阶级思想意识的表现的斗争中坚持布尔什维克的思想与原则，必须是党与苏维埃干部的不可缺少的品质。
    亲爱的斯大林同志！您经常地教导我们布尔什维克要象伟大的列宁一样，不要吝惜我们的精力去为我们的人民服务，尽一切努力进一步地提高我们热爱的祖国，为共产主义的胜利作一切事情。布尔什维克党、苏维埃人民、一切进步人类都把您看作是导师和领袖、列宁不朽事业的光辉的继承者。斯大林的名字对于我们人民以及全世界的普通人民是最可宝贵的。斯大林的名字是行将到来的共产主义胜利的象征。苏维埃人民和地球上千百万劳动者的心里，充满着对您，伟大斯大林的赤热的爱！
