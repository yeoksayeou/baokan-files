　　造成六年计划最好出发点
  　波三年计划提前完成
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】十一月十七日，波兰人民论坛报发表波兰国家经济计划委员会完成三年经济建设计划的公报，内称：
    三年经济建设计划已在两年又十个月中完成。工业部、林业部和航运部的生产价值达三百五十七亿兹罗提（波币，此处按一九三七年价值计算），这意味着完成了计划的百分之一百点六。
    工业
    工业各部门完成三年计划的情形如下：采矿与动力部百分之九十九，重工业部百分之一○一，轻工业部百分之九十七，食品与农业工业部百分之一○八，林业部百分之一一八，航运部百分之九十九。
    到本年十一月一日，下述各重要部门，都完成了或超过了三年经济计划：生铁百分之一○五，辗钢一○八，褐煤一一六，盐一一○，农业机器和器具一○○，染料一五二，电力机器一二一（其中包括离心机百分之一○六，变压器一四七，电缆一六六，蓄电器和金属板一四一，电灯泡一○○）。麻纱一一九，丝织品一一二，赛璐珞一○二，软革一○六，皮鞋（大规模生产的）一二四，水门汀一○二，杂项家具一一三，火柴一○六，豆类一二六，酒类一一四，纸烟一二七，糖果、巧克力糖、可可一三四，马铃薯制品一二一。
    农业
    农业方面完成了经济建设计划的情形，据最近结果如下：（甲）播种计划：小麦百分之一○五，裸麦一一五，马铃薯一○六，甜菜一一○，纤维作物一五三，榨油作物一二七。（乙）收获计划：小麦百分之一○八，裸麦一二二，马铃薯一一二，甜菜一一一，纤维作物一五六，榨油作物一二七。（丙）完成计划目标的百分比：小麦百分之一○六，裸麦一一八，马铃薯一○○，甜菜一○八，榨油作物九四，纤维作物一○三。
    养马完成计划百分之一○三，养牛完成一二二。猪的数目还没有达到三年计划所定的目标，但超过了一九四九年规定的目标。
    购买合同计划方面：作物完成百分之一一一，牲畜完成了一五七。拖拉机的数目为计划目标的百分之一○六。以机器和工具供给农业的计划超过百分之二，以肥料供给农业的计划超过百分之五。
    国营农场完成了三年播种计划的百分之一○一，它们养马超过计划百分之五，养牛超过百分之四十二，养猪方面超过百分之三十一。
    国家森林完成了造林和采伐计划百分之一○六。
    运输
    运输方面，据初步数字，到十月三十一日为止情况如下：货运完成百分之一○二，客运一一四。在同一时期中，铁路货车和机车的数目达到了计划的百分之一○二，铁道客车的数目达到百分之一○六。国营汽车运输完成了三年货运计划的百分之一二○，客运计划一一七。海港货物装卸未达到三年计划所定的水平。每人所发邮件数目为计划的百分之一○四。
    这样，三年经济建设计划在一切基本部门里都提早两个月完成了。这是由于以工人阶级为首劳动人民，按照波兰统一工人党第一届代表大会的号召而作努力和牺牲所致。
    目前生产已经超过三年计划所规定的任务。在整个波兰国民经济中，工人们都努力争取先期完成为今年规定的计划，并为实现六年计划造成最好的出发点。
