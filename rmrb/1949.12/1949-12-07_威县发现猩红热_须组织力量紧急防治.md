(Hebei News) Recently, an acute infectious disease was discovered in the villages of Haojiatun, Wushouzhuang, Yuti, Beizhangtai, Sanyizhuang, Hezhao, and other areas in the third district of Wei County. The symptoms are: chills, fever, sore throat, headache, swollen cervical lymph nodes, and hyperemia of the cornea. Patients die within one or two days. The disease originated in Haojiatun. In that village alone, which has only about 200 households, more than 50 young people and children have become ill and 26 have died within 20 days; and it is spreading extremely quickly. After examination by the People's Hospital, the disease was diagnosed as "scarlet fever." The Second Hospital of Hebei, the Wei County Hospital, and the Nangong Hospital of the Special Prefecture have been ordered to provide emergency treatment, but there is no unified organization or unified use of resources, and there is a lack of a common plan for research. At the same time, because doctors do not have scarlet fever serum, they can only use sulfa tablets, penicillin, etc. for temporary treatment. Therefore, it is still necessary to organize resources, increase the supply of medicines, and carry out rapid and effective prevention and treatment.

　　威县发现猩红热
  　须组织力量紧急防治
    【河北讯】威县三区郝家屯、吴守庄、鱼堤、北障台、三义庄、贺召等一带村庄，于最近发现一种急性传染病。病状是：发冷发热、嗓子疼、头疼、颈部淋巴腺肿、眼角膜充血，患者一、二天即死。此病由郝家屯发生起。该村仅二百来户，在二十天内，就有青年、儿童病者五十多人，死亡二十六人；并且向外蔓延极快。经人民医院检查，此病是“猩红热”。河北第二医院、威县县立医院、专署南宫医院，奉命前去抢救，但没有统一组织统一使用力量，缺乏共同计划研究；同时，医生们因没有猩红热血清，暂时只能用磺胺片、盘尼西林等治疗。故尚待组织力量、增配药品，作迅速有效之防治。
