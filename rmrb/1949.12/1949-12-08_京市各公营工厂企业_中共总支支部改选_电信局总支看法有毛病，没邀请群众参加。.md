　　Re-election of the General Branch and Branch Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Public Factories and Enterprises in Beijing
　　Telecommunications Bureau General Branch Has a Problematic View: Not Inviting the Masses to Participate.
　　[Beijing News] The re-election of the General Branch and Branch Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in public factories and enterprises in Beijing has now been largely completed. Since the public announcement of the Party branches in various factories and enterprises in June of this year, the relationship between Party members and the masses has become closer, and Party members have played an exemplary leading role everywhere, driving the masses and doing a good job. In the early days of Beijing's liberation, due to the unstable order, various tasks had not yet become regularized, and personnel in the factories had not yet been completely determined. Therefore, the secretaries and members of all Party general branches and branch committees were mostly appointed. Currently, the conditions for publicly and democratically electing branches have been met. At the党员大会 (Party member congresses) for the re-election of the general branches and branch committees in various factories, many factories had the participation of the masses. The masses were extremely moved by the ability of Party members to adopt strict and well-intentioned mutual criticism at the meetings, and to re-elect the branches in a democratic manner. However, some individual factories and enterprises, such as the Telecommunications Bureau General Branch, believe that if the masses participate when Party members are holding meetings, it will be awkward and inconvenient. Therefore, they did not invite the masses to participate when re-electing the General Branch. This view should be corrected.
　　[This Newspaper] Since the opening of the second phase of the Revolutionary University three months ago, the number of members of the New Democratic Youth League has grown to 1,072, and the number of Communist Party members has grown to 48. The ceremony for Party members to join the Party was held on the 3rd, attended by more than 800 people, including representatives of the school Party committee, student Party members, League members, study representatives, and general students. Hu Xikui, a representative of the school Party committee, spoke at the meeting.

　　京市各公营工厂企业
  　中共总支支部改选
    电信局总支看法有毛病，没邀请群众参加。
    【北京讯】京市各公营工厂、企业中的中共总支部、支部，现已大部改选完毕。各工厂企业中党的支部，自今年六月公开以后，党员和群众的关系更加密切了，党员处处起模范带头作用，带动群众，搞好了工作。北京的解放初期，由于秩序尚未安定，各种工作尚未走向正规，工厂中人事尚未完全确定，所有党的总支、支部书记和委员多系指定，目前，公开的民主选举支部的条件已经具备；在这次各工厂总支、支部改选的党员大会上，许多工厂中便有群众参加，群众对于会上党员之间能够采取严格的、善意的相互批评，采取民主方式改选支部，极为感动。但有个别工厂、企业，如电信局总支部等，认为党员开会时，如有群众参加，会有些蹩扭，感到不便，所以在改选总支时，未邀请群众参加。此种看法应改正。
    【本报讯】革大第二期开学三月以来，新民主主义青年团员已发展到一千零七十二人，共产党员已发展到四十八名。党员的入党仪式系于三日举行，出席有校党委会代表、学生党员、团员、学习代表及一般学员等八百余人。会上由校党委会代表胡锡奎讲话。
