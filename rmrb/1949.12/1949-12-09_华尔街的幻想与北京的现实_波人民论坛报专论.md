Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: The Polish United Workers' Party organ, "People's Tribune," sarcastically criticized the Kuomintang bandit gang's continued frantic relocation of their "capital" and the failure of the Kuomintang bandit gang's "delegation" to the United Nations, in an article entitled "Wall Street's Fantasies and Beijing's Reality." The paper wrote: While the Kuomintang bandit gang's pseudo-ministers were running to Hong Kong with their luggage and their pseudo-president was seeking refuge in an American sanatorium, Beijing not only became the capital of the victorious People's China, but also the center of the liberation movement of hundreds of millions of people in Asian colonies and other Asian countries. In describing the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference held in Beijing, attended by many trade union activists, the People's Tribune stated: The fact that such a conference is currently being held in the capital of liberated China most eloquently demonstrates the change in the balance of world power due to the victory of the Chinese people. The gentlemen who control the American voting machine at Success Lake are still deceiving themselves that the fate of hundreds of millions of people in the colonies is being resolved by Wall Street. However, the developments in Chongqing and Beijing show how wrong they are.

　　华尔街的幻想与北京的现实
  　波人民论坛报专论
    【新华社北京八日电】据波兰通讯社华沙五日讯：波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”以“华尔街的幻想与北京的现实”为题，讥讽地批评国民党匪帮继续拼命赶快地迁移他们的“首都”与国民党匪帮联大“代表团”的失败。该报写道：当国民党匪帮的伪部长们带着行李跑到香港，他们的伪总统希图在美国休养所避难时，北京不仅成为胜利的人民中国的首都，而且成为亚洲殖民地和亚洲其他各国亿万人民解放运动的中心。人民论坛报在叙述在北京召开的、有许多工会运动者参加的亚澳工会代表会议时称：这种会议目前在解放的中国首都召开，最雄辩地证明了由于中国人民的胜利而使世界力量对比发生的变化。在成功湖掌管美国表决机器的先生们，仍然欺骗自己说，殖民地亿万人民的命运正在由华尔街解决中。但是，重庆与北京的事态发展，说明了他们是如何地错误。
