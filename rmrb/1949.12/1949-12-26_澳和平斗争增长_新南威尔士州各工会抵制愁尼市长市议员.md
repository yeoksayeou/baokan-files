　　Australian Peace Struggle Grows
　  Trade Unions in New South Wales Boycott Mayor and City Councilors of Sydney
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th] Electone News Agency, Sydney, 22nd: Trade unions in New South Wales, Australia, are boycotting the Mayor of Sydney and members of the city council because they refused to allow the Australian Peace Committee to hold meetings in the City Hall. The Building Workers' Industrial Union has notified Mayor Cordia stating: "Construction workers will not work for him and those who deny the democratic rights of the people." The Hotel, Club and Restaurant Employees' Union has withdrawn catering staff from the City Hall and from any other location frequented by the Mayor and councilors. This action occurred because the Sydney City authorities refused to allow the Peace Committee to meet in the City Hall and in response to the current Australian Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, Menzies, who had requested the dropping of an atomic bomb on the Soviet Union. The Waterside Workers' Federation stated that if the Mayor of Sydney wanted to leave Sydney by ship, "he might encounter many problems when boarding."
    Although the Australian Peace Committee was banned from holding meetings in Sydney City Hall, it has still held many successful peace gatherings and several peace conferences throughout the country. Peace branches have been established in many factories, mines, cities and suburbs, and a nationwide peace vote movement has been launched.

　　澳和平斗争增长
　  新南威尔士州各工会抵制愁尼市长市议员
    【新华社北京二十五日电】电通社悉尼二十二日讯：澳大利亚新南威尔士州各工会实行抵制悉尼市长及该市市议员们，因为他们不许澳大利亚和平委员会在市议厅开会。建筑业工人工会已通知市长奥地亚称：“建筑工人将不为他以及那些否认人民民主权利的人们工作”。旅馆、俱乐部及餐馆职工会已撤回市议厅的炊事人员以及市长和众议员们所到达的任何其他地方的炊事人员。这个行动的发生，是由于悉尼市当局不许和平委员会在市议厅开会和对现任澳大利亚总理、自由党领袖孟席斯的回答，因为孟席斯曾要求对苏联投原子弹。码头工人联合会称，如果悉尼市长想乘船离开悉尼的话，“他可能会在上船时遇到许多麻烦”。
    虽然澳大利亚和平委员会被禁止在悉尼市议厅开会，但它仍然在各地举行了许多次成功的和平集会及若干次和平大会。在许多工厂、矿场、城市及郊外，都已设立了和平分会，并已发动了全国性的和平投票运动。
