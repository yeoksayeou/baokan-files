　　Workers in Beijing, Xi'an and Other Cities
　　Launch Public Bond Pre-purchase Campaign
    They Wish to Do Their Utmost to Help the Nation Overcome Financial Difficulties!
    [Our Newspaper] A public bond pre-purchase campaign has been launched among workers in Beijing. Railway workers in the Beijing area, including the Dispatch Office, Public Security Group, Personnel Group, and Telegraph Office, have already purchased 265 shares of public bonds. All employees of the Second Warehouse of the General Telecommunications Bureau have purchased more than 150 shares.
　　(Lai Weiliang, Qun)
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to vigorously promote the Victory Real Value Public Bond purchase campaign, the Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Trade Union Federation Preparatory Committee convened a symposium on December 20th with more than 40 cadres from 39 branch unions. At the meeting, Lu Kejun, director of the Xi'an Branch of the Trade Union Federation Preparatory Committee, particularly pointed out: Our working class should unconditionally support the call of the People's Government, and enthusiastically purchase bonds on the principle of conscious voluntarism, in order to overcome the country's economic difficulties and strive to stabilize prices. He also asked everyone to return to their work posts and use propaganda to get through to the minds of all railway workers, influencing and motivating others with actions, especially to carry out in-depth propaganda to industrialists, businessmen, and farmers, in order to promote this movement. The meeting decided to coordinate with the New Year's Day celebration in 1950, and the branch unions at all levels should launch a full-line publicity campaign and public bond purchase movement. At the meeting, the cadres automatically signed up to pre-purchase 168 shares of public bonds. Ma Kezhong, the head of the bureau's branch, took the lead in purchasing 11 shares. He said, "Although my income is limited and my burden is heavy, I am willing to do my best to play a leading role as a cadre." Comrade Wang Xiuzhen only earns five bags of flour a month, but she silently purchased eight shares.
