Tianjin No. 2 Textile Factory Saves 900 Million in Two Months; Reduction in Substandard Cloth Improves Product Quality

[Our Report] Since fully launching the conservation movement, Tianjin No. 2 Textile Factory has accumulated a large amount of wealth for the country in the past two months. The most significant achievements include the reduction of unbranded yarn, waste yarn, white oily cotton, cloth roller waste, and substandard cloth, as well as the application of water-soaked and fire-damaged cotton, resulting in savings of as much as 915 million RMB. The factory adopted the suggestion of the Trial Training Department to replace the unbranded yarn used for bundling small packages with 3-count 2-ply yarn spun from waste cotton, greatly reducing the usage of unbranded yarn. The savings from this item alone are equivalent to 59,931 jin of corn flour. In the past, No. 2 Factory wasted returned flower waste, which affected the quality of cotton yarn and the consumption of raw cotton. After the establishment of typical work groups in the workshops, the focus of the spinning workshop was on reducing the output of leather roller waste and white oily cotton. Employees voluntarily established a statistical system for leather roller waste and white oily cotton. In the five months before the conservation effort, the average monthly output of leather roller waste was 42,969 jin, while in October after the conservation effort, it was only 25,277 jin. The reduction of white oily cotton also created a record, decreasing from an average of 4,043 jin in the five months before the conservation effort to 2,161 jin. In order to reduce the output of small yarn and poor yarn, the factory visited other textile factories in October to learn from their experience in dealing with small yarn and poor yarn, and formulated new rules, reducing waste yarn from 17 pieces before the conservation effort to 12.95 pieces and 11.5 pieces. The amount saved is equivalent to approximately 32,088 jin of corn flour. Unbranded yarn was reduced from 23.69 pieces before the conservation effort to 11 pieces and 18 pieces, equivalent to approximately 8,332 jin of corn flour. In the past, the inventory of water-soaked and fire-damaged cotton was nearly hundreds of thousands of jin, and it was piled up in the warehouse without being utilized. Since the start of production conservation, the Trial Training Department has transferred this water-soaked and fire-damaged cotton, and it has now been completely used up. The problem of substandard cloth was very serious in the past few months. Due to the large output of substandard cloth, the rate of first-quality cloth was only about 85%, which greatly affected the quality. The leadership attached great importance to this issue and called on the factory to match the first-quality cloth rate of fraternal factories. Discussions were held in the workshops, reward and punishment methods were formulated, and specific methods for reducing substandard cloth were established. Immediate inspections and criticisms were carried out. Now the rate of substandard cloth has dropped from 15% to 7% and 4.6%, with remnants accounting for only 4.3% and 1.9%, creating a new record of 95.4% for first-quality cloth since liberation.

　　天津中纺二厂两月节约九亿元
    次布减少产品质量提高
    【本报讯】天津中纺二厂在全力展开节约运动后，两个月来，已为国家积蓄了大量资财。其中成绩最显著的为无牌纱、废纱、白油花、布辊花、次布的减少及水火残棉的应用等，即节约人民币九亿一千五百万元之多。该厂采用了试训部的建议将过去纱厂捆小包用的无牌纱，一律改用了废棉纺成的三支二合股，使无牌纱的使用量大为减少。仅此一项节约所得，即可折合玉米面五万九千九百三十一市斤。回花下脚过去二厂是比较浪费的，影响棉纱品质及原棉消耗。在车间典型工作小组成立后，细纱间的工作即以减少皮辊花及白油花的出数为主，职工自动树立起皮辊花及白油花的统计制度，节约前五个月，平均每月出皮辊花四二九六九市斤，节约后十月份只出了二五二七七市斤。白油花的减少也造成了最高纪录，从节约前五个月平均出四○四三市斤降低到二一六一市斤。该厂为了减少小纱及壤纱的出数，十月份曾参观中纺其他各厂，吸取对处理小纱壤纱的经验，拟定新制度，使废纱由节约前十七件降到十二．九五件及十一．五件，节约数量折合成玉米面约为三二○八八市斤。无牌纱由节约前二十三．六九件降低到十一件及十八件，约合玉米面八三三二市斤。过去库存水火残棉一部将近十数万市斤，堆积库房未能利用，自生产节约后，试训部调用这部水火残棉，现已全部应用完毕。次布问题，过去几个月非常严重，因次布出数较多，使正布率只能达百分之八十五左右，影响品质甚巨。领导上非常重视这个问题，号召正布要与兄弟厂看齐，在车间展开讨论，拟定奖惩办法，并规定出减低次布的具体办法，即时进行检查和批评，现在次布率已由百分之十五降到百分之七及百分之四．六，其中残布仅占百分之四．三及百分之一．九，造成解放后正布率达百分之九十五．四的新记录。
