The world-scale mass movement congratulating Stalin on his seventieth birthday is one of the most important international events of recent times.

Whether in socialist countries and people's democratic countries, in capitalist countries and dependent countries and colonies, whether in the West, in the East, or in any corner of the world, tens of millions of people are celebrating this extraordinary festival. Many places held celebrations or parades of hundreds of thousands of people, many countries sent congratulatory letters signed by millions of people, and good news of completing or exceeding birthday production competitions came from everywhere. Cities here were renamed Stalin City, roads there were renamed Stalin Avenue, countless congratulatory words, greetings, letters, and telegrams were sent to Moscow, and countless most memorable gifts were sent to the Kremlin. "All working people, suffering people, hopeful people, and fighting people unanimously expressed their gratitude to their leader, their mentor, and their guide, Comrade Stalin." They all look up to this familiar face and wish him a long life.

The working people of all countries in the world enthusiastically celebrate Stalin's birthday as if it were their own festival, which shows that they are willing to unite closely around Stalin, unite around the bulwark of the peace and democracy camp, the Soviet Union, and resolutely fight for lasting world peace and people's democracy, and fight for a better future for mankind. While the imperialist camp is frantically preparing for a new war, the great Stalin's birthday has become a day for the working people of the world, peace-loving people, and people friendly to the Soviet Union to widely mobilize their forces, and has become a great demonstration against the American and British war-mongers.

　　War-mongers Intensify the Promotion of Adventurous Plans

American war-mongers are stepping up the implementation of military plans for preparing aggressive war in West Germany and Japan.

In early December, the high commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany met in Petersberg and passed a resolution to establish a West German mercenary army. They are preparing to build eleven divisions of troops in the name of "police force," with 10,000 people in each division. They also decided on the steps to support West Germany's military industry. As for the backbone of the aforementioned army, U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley have formulated a plan with former Hitler army chief of staff Halder and Guderian to recruit former Nazi officers and stormtroopers to serve. And in West Germany, the headquarters of the mercenary army already exists in fact. This sinister plan of U.S. imperialism is an important part of its overall plan to implement imperialist policies in Germany. After the end of World War II, the entire U.S. policy towards Germany was to undermine the Potsdam Agreement, divide Germany, and make West Germany a springboard for launching a new war. For this purpose, it has taken a series of steps that endanger the interests of the German nation and world peace. Since this year, under the planning of the American reactionaries, the so-called "Occupation Statute" attempting to replace the German peace treaty has been promulgated, and the West German puppet "state" has also been established. The meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held in Paris in early November also generally decided to intensify the support of West Germany's aggressive forces. In late November, the high commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany again signed a so-called "Protocol" with the West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer. This "Protocol" stipulates that West Germany can participate in the "Council of Europe" (this is the political coordination of the North Atlantic Alliance) as an assisting member, can send observers to the Ruhr "International Control Bureau," can participate in the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," and can reduce the number of dismantled factories, etc. Now the United States and other imperialists are further engaging in the conspiracy to prepare for a new war by rearming West Germany.

However, the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to rearm West Germany and thus launch a new war has been strongly opposed by the German people. The German Peace Committee, the Central Committee of the German Democratic Women's Federation, and the National Committee of the Free German Youth have successively issued statements in early December. They called on all democratic mass organizations in the German Democratic Republic and all Germans who support peace to resolutely protest the Adenauer puppet government's policy of preparing for a new war under the support of U.S. imperialism.

In Japan, the United States is also looking for mercenary troops, preparing to make them cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism. Under such a plan, the Japanese army has been revived under the disguise of the police, and its numbers are increasing day by day. The police are now able to be equipped with heavy weapons. Police in many prefectures of Japan are conducting large-scale military exercises. Japanese companies are salvaging the ammunition of the former Japanese army and navy that has been thrown into the sea. At the same time, Japan's democratic forces have encountered unscrupulous police terror, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan is being unreasonably delayed by U.S. imperialists.

What do the above facts illustrate? It illustrates two aspects of the problem: First, although the strength of the peace and democracy camp has grown tremendously, the danger of war has not decreased. The resolution of the Information Bureau meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties held not long ago pointed out: "Historical experience teaches people: the more desperate the imperialist reactionaries are, the more rampant they are, and the greater the danger of military adventures." Therefore, whoever underestimates the danger of a new war being prepared by the U.S.-British group will make a mistake. Second, the fact that the war-mongers are stepping up their preparations for war also shows that they are very weak, very anxious, and very panicked. Therefore, if the people maintain the greatest vigilance and actively fight for peace by all means, the war-mongers' evil conspiracy will eventually be smashed.

　　New Situation in Indonesia

After the Dutch and Indonesian reactionary parliaments successively approved the "Hague Agreement," and after Sukarno and Hatta, who were released from cages by the Dutch, reappeared on the stage, the representatives of the Dutch imperialists and the Indonesian bourgeois reactionaries are scheduled to stage a farce of "transferring" and "accepting" sovereignty in Amsterdam and Batavia on the 27th of this month. After this, a so-called "United States of Indonesia" will replace the Republic of Indonesia, which was born on August 17, 1945, and will be imposed on the 75 million Indonesian people. Imperialists and their lackeys are trumpeting that the "United States of Indonesia" is a newly independent and sovereign state. However, in the eyes of the Indonesian people and world progressive public opinion, it is nothing more than a colonial puppet regime established by imperialists in Southeast Asia. Because the so-called "United States of Indonesia," according to the Hague Agreement, is a member of the "Dutch-Indonesian Federation" under the rule of the Queen of the Netherlands. It is actually deprived of all political, diplomatic, and economic independent and autonomous rights, and all major measures in these areas must be approved by the Dutch. This is also because what Sukarno and Hatta accepted from the Dutch was not the independent sovereignty of Indonesia, but the entire Dutch colonial apparatus, personnel, and the colonial army raised by them to slaughter the Indonesian people in Indonesia. And in the new cabinet formed by Hatta, who is pro-American and pro-Dutch, there are many people, such as Anak Agung and Hamid II, who have always been the confidants and dogs of the Dutch, the so-called federalist elements. Finally, and more importantly, the so-called "United States of Indonesia" was established under the guidance of Cochran, the agent of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism will inevitably surpass Dutch imperialism in the future and become the supreme master of Indonesia. Therefore, the establishment of the "United States of Indonesia" has made Indonesia a colony that must obey both the Netherlands and the United States. However, on the other hand, due to the establishment of such a "United States," the face of the Sukarno and Hatta group willing to sell the independence and freedom of the Indonesian people is even more exposed, which will inevitably strengthen the resistance of the Indonesian people who love independence against imperialism and its domestic running dogs.

### 光荣归于斯大林

专栏：

　　光荣归于斯大林
    祝贺斯大林七十寿辰的世界规模的群众运动，是最近时期中重要的国际事件之一。
    不论在社会主义国家和人民民主国家，在资本主义国家和附属国家及殖民地，也不论在西方，在东方，或者在世界的任何角落，千千万万的人们都在欢庆这一非常的节日。不少的地方召开了几十万人的庆祝大会或庆祝游行，好多国家送去了几百万人签名的贺函，到处传来完成或者超过祝寿生产竞赛的佳音，这里的城市改名为斯大林城，那里的的马路改名为斯大林大道，数不尽的祝词、贺词、贺信、贺电送往莫斯科，数不尽的最值得纪念的礼物送在克里姆林宫。“一切作工的人们，受苦的人们，抱着希望的人们，进行斗争的人们，都一致地表示对他们的领袖、他们的导师、他们的响导——斯大林同志的感激。”他们都仰望着这一熟识的面孔，都祝贺他万寿无疆。
    五洲万国的劳动人民都把斯大林的寿辰当作自己的节日一样热烈地庆祝，这表示他们愿意紧密地团结在斯大林的周围，团结在和平民主阵营的堡垒苏联的周围，坚决地为世界的持久和平与人民民主而斗争，为人类美好的将来而斗争。当帝国主义阵营正在疯狂地进行新战争准备的时候，伟大的斯大林的寿辰，变成了全世界的劳动人民、爱好和平的人们、对苏友好的人们广泛地动员他们力量的日子，变成了对美英战争贩子的大示威。
    战贩加紧推行冒险计划
    美国战争贩子正在西德与日本加紧推行准备侵略战争的军事计划。
    十二月初，美英法驻西德高级专员在彼得斯堡集会，通过建立西德雇佣军队的决议，他们准备以“警察部队”的名义建军十一个师，每师一万人。他们又决定了扶植西德军事工业的步骤。至于前述军队的骨干，美国国防部长詹森和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷，已与前希特勒军队的参谋总长霍尔德和古德林拟定计划，准备召集以前的纳粹军官和冲锋队员来担任。而在西德的歧孙，事实上已经有了雇佣军队的总部。美帝国主义这一阴谋计划，是它对德国实行帝国主义政策总计划中的重要的一部分。在第二次大战结束以后，美国对德的整个政策，是破坏波茨坦协定，分裂德国，并使西德成为它发动新战争的跳板。为此目的，它曾采取了一系列危害德国民族利益和世界和平的步骤。今来以来，在美国反动派的策划之下，企图代替对德和约的所谓“占领法规”颁布了，西德傀儡“国家”也成立了。十一月初旬在巴黎举行的美英法外长会议，又曾一般地决定了要加紧扶植西德的侵略力量。十一月下旬，美英法驻西德高级专员再与西德傀儡总理阿登纳在波恩签订所谓“议定书”，这一“议定书”规定西德可以参加“欧洲委员会”（这是北大西洋联盟的政治配合物）为襄助会员，可以派观察员参加鲁尔“国际管制局”，可以参加“欧洲经济合作局”，可以削减拆卸工厂的数量等等。现在美国等帝国主义更进一步地以重新武装西德，来从事新战争准备阴谋活动了。
    但是美帝国主义者重新武装西德从而发动新战争的阴谋，已遭到德国人民的强烈反对。德国和平委员会、德国民主妇联中央委员会、自由德国青年全国委员会，已于十二月初相继发表声明，他们号召德意志民主共和国的一切民主的群众组织和一切拥护和平的德国人，坚决抗议阿登纳傀儡政府在美帝国主义扶植下准备新战争的政策。
    在日本，美国也在寻找雇佣军队，准备使他们成为美帝国主义的炮灰。在这样的计划之下，日本军队已在警察的伪装下复活，其数量正日益增加。警察已能配有重武器。日本许多县份的警察都在进行大规模的军事演习。日本公司正在打捞已被抛入海中的前属日本陆海军的弹药。与此同时，日本的民主力量已经遭遇到肆无忌惮的警察恐怖，而对日和约的缔结，却正被美帝国主义者无理地延宕着。
    上面的事实说明了什么呢？它说明了两方面的问题：第一，和平民主阵营的力量虽有巨大的增长，但战争的危险并未减少，不久以前举行的共产党与工人党情报局会议的决议曾经指出：“历史的经验教训人们：帝国主义反动派愈是绝望，则它愈猖狂，而且军事冒险的危险则愈大。”因此，谁要是低估美英集团正在准备的新战争危险，那就会犯错误。第二，战争贩子之所以加紧备战，这又表现他们很软弱，很着急，很慌张，因此，人民如果保有最大的警惕，并以一切方法为和平而积极进行斗争，那么，战争贩子的罪恶阴谋终将被粉碎。
    印尼新局势
    在荷兰与印尼反动议会先后批准“海牙协议”之后，在被荷兰人从囚笼中放出的苏加诺与哈达再度袍笏登场之后，荷兰帝国主义者与印尼资产阶级反动派的代表，定于本月二十七日同时在阿姆斯特丹与巴达维亚演出一幕“移交”与“接受”主权的滑稽剧。在这以后，一个所谓“印尼合众国”，即将代替一九四五年八月十七日诞生的印尼共和国，而强加于七千五百万印尼人民的头上。帝国主义及其走卒大吹大擂地说：“印尼合众国”是一个新生独立主权的国家。但是，在印尼人民及世界进步舆论看来，它不过是帝国主义者在东南亚所树立的殖民地傀儡政权的一个。因为所谓“印尼合众国”，根据海牙的协议，乃是荷兰女王统辖下的“荷印联邦”的一员，它实际上被剥夺了一切政治上，外交上、经济上独立自主的权利，一切有关这些方面的重大措施，均须得到荷兰人的批准。这又因为苏加诺、哈达自荷兰人手中接受的并不是印尼的独立主权，而是荷兰在印尼的全部殖民地机构、人员及其所豢养的屠杀印尼人民的殖民地军队，而在媚美亲荷的哈达所组成的新阁中，更有不少人，如阿纳克·阿贡、哈米德二世之流，一直是荷兰人的心腹走狗，即所谓联邦派分子。最后，更重要的是，所谓“印尼合众国”是在美帝国主义的代理人柯契伦一手扶植之下建立起来的。美帝国主义今后势将更加凌驾荷帝国主义之上而成为印尼的最高主人。因此，“印尼合众国”的成立，使得印尼变成了既要听命荷兰更要服从美国的殖民地。然而，另一方面，由于这样一个“合众国”的成立，苏加诺、哈达集团甘愿出卖印尼人民独立自由的面目，是更加暴露了，这也就必得使热爱独立的印尼人民对帝国主义及其国内走狗的反抗更加强起来。
