　　[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency dispatch: People around the world held grand gatherings on the 21st with great enthusiasm to celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday. Budapest, the Hungarian capital, held a get-together on the 21st to celebrate Stalin's birthday. The banks of the Danube were shrouded in a rare atmosphere of joy. Thousands upon thousands of Budapest citizens gathered along the river to enjoy the celebratory salutes and fireworks. The National Assembly building and other buildings were hung with many huge red stars with a diameter of ten meters, which, together with the flashes of the salutes and rockets, shone brilliantly throughout the city. All the theaters, clubs, and cinemas in the capital held birthday concerts and screened many Soviet films depicting the great Stalin. Many central cities in provinces across the country held birthday rallies, parades, or concerts.
　　　　　Romania
　　On the 21st, the people of the Romanian capital held grand celebratory parades and rallies. More than 250,000 people gathered in squares and nearby streets. Groza, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a speech at the meeting. When he spoke of the Romanian people's love for the great leader Stalin—who opened the path to a happy new life for them and was their most loyal friend—his speech was repeatedly interrupted by cheers of "Long live Comrade Stalin."
　　　　　Germany
　　On the 21st, mass rallies and demonstrations celebrating the birthday were held in all states of the German Democratic Republic. Local branches of the German-Soviet Friendship Association have been established in various enterprises in Saxony-Anhalt. Many public enterprises in the republic exceeded their production plans and completed their 1949 tasks in celebration of the birthday.
