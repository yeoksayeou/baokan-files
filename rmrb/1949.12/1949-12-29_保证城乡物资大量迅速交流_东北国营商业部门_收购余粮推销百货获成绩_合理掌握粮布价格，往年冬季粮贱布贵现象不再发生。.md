Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th – Under the leadership of the Commercial Department of the Northeast People's Government, the unprecedented winter urban-rural material exchange work organized and carried out by the Northeast Grain Company, the Northeast Native Produce Company, and the Northeast General Merchandise Company has now achieved great results. According to statistics from the Commercial Department, the Northeast Grain Company’s work in purchasing surplus grain from farmers in October and November alone completed and exceeded 110% of the planned grain purchase for October, November, and December. In October alone, the total value of native products purchased and sold for farmers by the Northeast Native Produce Company reached several hundred billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). At the same time, the Northeast General Merchandise Company, in coordination with the above-mentioned purchase work, also promoted a large amount of cloth and other essential industrial products to the rural areas of Northeast China. Due to the efforts of state-owned commerce and cooperatives throughout Northeast China, state-owned commerce played a major role in the circulation of goods between urban and rural areas in Northeast China, ensuring a large-scale and rapid exchange of goods and stabilizing market prices. In previous years, farmers urgently needed to sell grain and purchase winter clothing every winter, resulting in a sharp drop in grain prices and a surge in cloth prices. This phenomenon no longer occurs in Northeast China this year. The Northeast Grain, Native Produce, and General Merchandise Companies have all grasped reasonable prices in purchasing grain and native products and promoting industrial products such as cloth, gradually narrowing the price difference between grain and cloth, preventing speculators from taking advantage and ensuring that farmers' income is not exploited by intermediaries.

	Purchase of Surplus Grain from Farmers Greatly Exceeds Previous Years

The work of purchasing surplus grain from farmers, which plays a leading role in the exchange of goods, has greatly exceeded previous years in all provinces of Northeast China this year, with farmers willingly selling their grain. Heilongjiang Province will be able to complete the province's grain purchase target for 1950 by the end of December and may exceed it. The more than 60 grain stations under the province's Grain Company purchase an average of 5,000 tons of grain per day, with the highest reaching 8,500 tons. The number of grain trucks entering the market in the province was 4,000 per day in early October, and has now increased to 15,000. In the 50 days up to the end of November, the Songjiang Province Grain Company purchased more than 130,800 tons of grain, exceeding 64% of the province's grain purchase target. In mid-November, Liaoxi Province exceeded its original grain purchase target by 50,000 tons and began a new grain purchase task; by the end of November, the province had completed more than 32% of the new task. By the end of November, Rehe Province had also completed more than 88% of the province's grain purchase task. In the process of purchasing grain, the Grain Company strictly classified good and bad grain into three grades and purchased them at different prices, which stimulated farmers to process grain and ensured the quality of the purchased grain. At present, in addition to continuing to purchase grain, the companies in various provinces are actively strengthening grain storage and transportation.

The smooth progress of grain purchase work in Northeast China this year is due to: 1. The Grain Company prepared sufficient funds early and started the purchase work in October, one month earlier than last year. 2. The prices of the Grain Company and cooperatives are fair; the procedures are simple, and farmers can save the commission of selling grain through brokers in the past. Reception stations for grain-selling farmers have been set up in Harbin, Jinzhou, Siping and other places. 3. The General Merchandise Company supplied farmers with the cloth and winter supplies they needed at low prices.

	Promoting Sideline Products Increases Farmers' Income

The purchase work of the Northeast Native Produce Company is also active in winter. In addition to purchasing industrial raw materials and Northeast specialties for export, the company also promotes various sideline products for farmers. According to statistics from the last ten days of October, the company purchased more than 180.3 billion yuan of native products; the total value of native products sold for farmers in October reached 228.4 billion yuan. In December, the company is using huge amounts of funds to purchase 34 kinds of rural sideline products, and actively encourages private factories to go to the countryside to purchase and help farmers sell their products in cities, and help farmers in remote areas solve the difficulty of transporting their native products. In this way, the sales of native products and various sideline products in Northeast China have been expanded, and those without sales have found sales; it has directly supported the development of rural sideline production in Northeast China and increased the wealth of farmers and the country.

	A Large Number of Cloth and Industrial Products Flow to Rural Areas to Meet Farmers' Needs

While a large amount of surplus grain and native products from farmers in Northeast China are flowing to cities, state-owned commerce has also organized a large number of cloth and other industrial daily necessities to flow to rural areas to meet the increasingly improved living requirements of farmers in rural areas after land reform. In October, the Northeast General Merchandise Corporation distributed cloth and other goods to more than 130 general merchandise companies throughout Northeast China to promote sales in rural areas. In September and October alone, the 11 sales units directly under the head office sold a total of 198,700 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth (one bundle of yarn is counted as one piece of cloth), 88,000 dozens of knitwear, more than 1,000 tons of kerosene, and a large number of paper and other goods, exceeding the original sales plan. In October and November, the Heilongjiang Province General Merchandise Company sold 294,000 pieces of cloth, more than 1,000 tons of cotton, and 110,000 pairs of Ula (Northeast winter shoes) to farmers. The Harbin General Merchandise Company also implemented price reductions to promote sales in rural areas, creating the company's highest sales record in November. In areas where rural cooperative organizations are more common, such as Heilongjiang Province, the General Merchandise Company has signed agency sales contracts with cooperatives in various places. The General Merchandise Companies in Changchun and Liaoxi Province have also organized "rural sales teams" or "rural service teams" to go to the countryside to sell goods.

	Cooperatives Have Become a Powerful Assistant to State-Owned Commerce

In this large-scale exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in Northeast China, rural and urban cooperatives have become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce. This winter, more than 1,300 cooperatives in Liaoxi Province are all focusing on promoting rural sideline products and supplying farmers with daily necessities as their main business. In October, the native products purchased by the Heilongjiang Province Native Produce Company through cooperatives accounted for 37% of its total purchases, while the goods sold by the province's General Merchandise Company through cooperatives in October and November also reached 30% of its total sales. The grain purchased by cooperatives in Songjiang and Rehe provinces for the country also accounted for more than 40% of the grain purchased in each province. The rural cooperative movement in Northeast China has also made considerable progress in this large-scale exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and new cooperatives are constantly being established in various places. This is because cooperatives directly help rural production and serve their members in the business of purchasing agricultural and sideline products and supplying industrial daily necessities, thus increasing their prestige among farmers.

　　保证城乡物资大量迅速交流
    东北国营商业部门收购余粮推销百货获成绩
    合理掌握粮布价格，往年冬季粮贱布贵现象不再发生。
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】在东北人民政府商业部的领导下，东北粮食公司、东北土产公司和东北百货公司公司所组织和进行的全东北规模空前的冬季城乡物资交流工作，现在已经获得巨大的成绩。据商业部统计：东北粮食公司收购农民余粮的工作，在十月和十一月两个月中，就完成并超过了十、十一、十二三个月的购粮计划的百分之一百一十以上。东北土产公司仅在十月份内，收购和为农民推销的土产品的总值即达数千亿元（东北币，下同）之巨。同时，东北百货公司配合上述收购工作，亦向全东北农村推销了大量的布匹和其他工业必需品。由于全东北国营商业和合作社的努力，在东北城乡物资的流通过程中，国营商业起了主要作用；保证了城乡物资大量而迅速的交流，使市场物价平稳。往年每届冬季，农民急需售粮和购置冬衣，因而粮价据跌，布价高涨，今年此种现象在东北已不复发生。东北粮食、土产、百货等公司，在收购粮食、土产和推销布匹等工业品中，均掌握了合理的价格，逐渐缩小了粮布价格的差额，使投机商人无机可乘，保证了农民的所得不受中间剥削。
    收购农民余粮大大超过往年
    在物资交流中起主导作用的收购农民余粮的工作，在农民的乐意出售下，今年东北各省都大大地超过了往年。黑龙江省在十二月底即可全部完成一九五零年度该省的购粮数字，并可能超过。该省粮食公司所属的六十多个粮栈平均每天购进的粮食为五千吨，最多的达到八千五百吨。该省上市的粮车十月初为每天四千辆，现已增至一万五千辆。松江省粮食公司在截至十一月底止的五十天中，即购得粮食十三万零八百余吨，超过该省购粮数字的百分之六十四。辽西省在十一月中旬就超过了该省原订的购粮数字五万吨，并开始了新的购粮任务；到十一月底，该省又完成了新任务的百分之三十二强。热河省在十一月底，也已完成了该省购粮任务的百分之八十八以上。购粮中，粮食公司严格将好坏粮食分作三等按不同价格收购，刺激了农民对粮食的加工，保证了购得粮食的质量。现各省公司除继续收购外，正积极加强粮食的保管和运输等工作。
    今年东北粮食收购工作的顺利是由于：一、粮食公司及早准备了充分的资金，较去年提前一个月于十月就开始进行收购工作。二、粮食公司和合作社价格公道；手续简便，农民售粮可节省过去经行栈售粮的佣金。哈尔滨、锦州、四平等地并设有卖粮农民的招待栈。三、百货公司廉价供应了农民所需要的布匹和冬季用品。
    推销副业产品增加农民收入
    东北土产公司的收购工作在冬季也活跃起来。该公司除收购工业原料和出口的东北特产外，并为农民推销各种副业产品，该公司收购的土产仅据十月下旬十天的统计即达一千八百零三亿余元；十月份为农民推销的土产品总值达二千二百八十四亿余元。十二月份该公司正以巨额资金，收购三十四种农村副业产品，并积极鼓励私营厂商下乡收购和帮助农民进城推销，帮助偏僻地区的农民解决其土产品运输的困难。这样使东北的土产与各种副业产品，原有销路的扩大了销路，没有销路的找到了销路；直接扶助了东北农村副业生产的发展，增进了农民和国家的财富。
    大量布匹和工业品流向农村满足农民需要
    在东北农民余粮和土产品大量流向城市的同时，国营商业又组织了大量的布匹和其他工业日用品流向农村，以满足土地改革后的农村中农民日益提高了的生活要求。十月份，东北百货总公司即将布匹等货物，分发到了遍布东北各地的一百三十多个百货公司，向农村进行推销。仅总公司直属的十一个售货单位，在九、十两个月内就售出了棉纱和布匹共十九万八千七百余匹（纱一捆折布一匹算）、针织品八万八千余打，煤油一千余吨和大批的纸张等货物，超过了原订的售货计划。黑龙江省百货公司在十、十一两个月内，仅卖给农民的布匹就有二十九万四千余匹、棉花一千余吨、乌拉（东北冬鞋）十一万双。哈尔滨百货公司并实行减价向农村推销，在十一月份创造了该公司售货的最高纪录。在农村合作社组织较普遍地区如黑龙江省，百货公司就与各地合作社订立代销合同。长春和辽西省的百货公司并组织有“农村推销小组”或“农村服务队”下乡售货。
    合作社已成为国营商业的有力助手
    东北城乡合作社在这次城乡物资的大交流中，已成为国营商业的有力助手。辽西全省一千三百多个合作社，今冬都是以推销农村副产和供应农民日用品为其主要业务。黑龙江省土产公司十月份经合作社收购的土产占其收购总额的百分之三十七，而该省百货公司在十、十一两月内经合作社推销的货物亦达其售货总额的百分之三十。松江、热河两省的合作社，为国家收购的粮食，亦占各该省收购粮食的百分之四十以上。东北农村合作运动在这次城乡物资大交流中亦有相当的发展，各地不断有新合作社建立。这是由于合作社在收购农副产品和供应工业日用品的业务中，直接帮助了农村的生产和为社员服务，因而在农民中威信日益提高。
