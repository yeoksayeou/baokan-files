Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: TASS Shanghai dispatch: The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" recently reported that Japan is salvaging ammunition formerly belonging to the Japanese Army and Navy, which was dumped into the sea during the early period of the American occupation of Japan. According to the newspaper, the ammunition is submerged in ports such as Hiroshima and Sasebo, as well as other former naval bases and fortresses. The newspaper estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of shells, bombs, bullets, and other ammunition are submerged near Yokosuka, a former naval base. The salvage work is being carried out by a company in Tokyo, with two tons of ammunition being retrieved daily. People arriving in Shanghai from Japan report that the ammunition salvage work is being carried out with the knowledge and direct assistance of MacArthur's headquarters, and that this work is a complete violation of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's decisions regarding Japanese disarmament and demilitarization. The U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters in Yokohama began issuing permits to salvage submerged ammunition as early as the second half of 1948. A considerable portion of the 150,000 tons of shells, bombs, and bullets submerged off the Japanese coast has now been salvaged. This ammunition is undamaged and can still be used in combat. It is also reported that the ammunition and explosives will be sold to the bankrupt Kuomintang clique and the South Korean puppet "government" to wage war against their own people.

　　麦克阿瑟违反波茨坦宣言
　  助日打捞海底弹药 
    准备卖给破产的国民党匪帮
    【新华社北京二十五日电】塔斯社上海讯：日本“每日新闻”报于不久以前载称，日本正在打捞美军占领日本初期被抛入海中的前属日本陆海军的弹药。据该报称，弹药沉没在广岛、佐世保等港湾以及其他前海军基地与要塞附近。该报估计，约有五万吨炮弹、炸弹、枪弹和其他弹药沉没在前海军基地横须贺附近。打捞工作系由东京一公司进行，每日打捞弹药两吨。从日本抵上海的来人报告称：打捞弹药的工作是在麦克阿瑟总部知悉与直接帮助之下进行的，而这一工作是完全违犯波茨坦宣言和远东委员会关于日本裁减军备与非军国主义化的决定。驻横滨的美国第八军总部早在一九四八年下半年，即开始颁发打捞沉没弹药的许可证。沉没在日本沿海的十五万吨炮弹、炸弹和枪弹，现在已有颇大部分被打捞起来。这种弹药未受损害，仍可用以作战。又据报道称，弹药与炸药将被售与破产了的国民党集团和南朝鲜傀儡“政府”，来进行反对他们国内人民的战争。
