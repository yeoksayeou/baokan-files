How Did One, Two, Three, Four… Come About?
    Wang Wenjin
    An article on page 3 of the People's Daily on December 10th, "How Zhengding Middle School Conducts Ideological Education" (compiled by Liang Shiqing), in the section "Cultivating New Perspectives in Students Through Cultural Courses," uses the example of a teacher's "achievements" in teaching mathematics, saying: "For example, when a teacher was teaching mathematics, a student asked: 'How did one, two, three, four… come about?' He affirmed to the students that they were created by the working people. Initially, the working people calculated their labor results, you have a certain number of cattle, he has a certain number of sheep, and gradually they realized a commonality. From the concrete to the abstract, numbers were produced. If at that time there were five cattle or five sheep, then they would arrive at a five."
    I think that the math teacher's affirmation to the students that "they were created by the working people" is correct, but his further explanation is worth studying. "You have a certain number of cattle, he has a certain number of sheep," what exactly is this "certain number" calculated and measured with? How will students understand this "gradually realized commonality"? It is even more impossible to go "from the concrete to the abstract"! Then how exactly were "numbers produced"? Here, we can also ask: How did the working people define 1 to 10? Ten 10s as 100? ... The strangest thing is that the numerals of various ethnic groups, despite different languages, all have the same decimal system; what is the reason for this? Is it just a coincidence that people in different places went "from the concrete to the abstract"? And what prompted them to be so unanimous? How can this series of questions be given a "definite" answer from "labor results"?
    In fact, to answer the question "How did one, two, three, four… come about?" just have the questioning student hold out their two hands, and the student can understand most of the problem. Engels, in Anti-Dühring, Volume 1, Philosophy, stated simply and clearly: "People first learned to calculate from ten fingers, that is to say, to do the first arithmetic calculation." This means that humans initially calculated "labor results" using nothing other than their ten fingers. Without these hands, it is impossible to "realize"; impossible to go "from the concrete to the abstract"; even more impossible to create numbers, to create decimal numbers. Today's children often use their fingers to flex and extend when practicing addition. Although this is a well-known trivial matter, it further proves the correctness of Engels's argument.
    I think that when answering the question posed by the student, "How did one, two, three, four… come about?", it would be more correct to say something like this: "Human beings initially engaged in collective labor, and numbers, along with the emergence of language, were gradually created by the working people. How were they created? It was when people calculated their labor results (in fact, the objects they calculated were not limited to this, such as partners, tools, etc.), they had to use their ten fingers to calculate. Five sheep, then extend five fingers; five fruits, then extend five fingers. Over time, becoming more and more skilled, Engels also said: 'To calculate, not only should there be an object to be calculated, but there should also be the ability to do so... but this ability is the product of a long historical development and experience.' And the number of fingers extended was given a sound using language. As for numbers such as eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen… twenty, thirty, forty, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, etc., they are merely deductions from one to ten. Of course, this kind of deduction takes a very long time.”

### 一二三四……是怎样来的？

　　一二三四……是怎样来的？
    王文锦
    人民日报十二月十日第三版有一篇文章：“正定中学是怎样进行思想教育的”（梁世清整理）。在“通过文化课培养学生新观点”的一节中，以某教员在讲数学时“收到的一些成绩”为例说：“譬如某教员在讲数学时，有同学问：‘一二三四……是怎样来的？’他肯定的告诉同学，是劳动人民创造的。最初劳动人民计算自己的劳动成果，你有某只牛，他有某只羊，慢慢的他们体会出一个共同点，由具体到抽象，便产生了数字，若那时是五只牛或五只羊，那末他们便会得到一个五字。……”
    我以为数学教员肯定地告诉同学：“是劳动人民创造的”，这句话是对的，可是他进一步的解释时，便值得研究了。“你有某只牛，他有某只羊”，这个“某”，究竟用什么东西计算衡量出来的呢？学生又怎么会了解这个“慢慢”“体会出的一个共同点”？更无法“由具体到抽象”了！那么到底怎样“便产生了数字”？这里还可以追问一下：劳动人民怎样规定的从１到１０；十个１０为１００？……最奇怪的是各民族的数字，尽管语言不同，而十进位却都一致；这又是什么道理呢？难道说这就是各地人群们“由具体到抽象”的一种巧合吗？又是什么促使他们如此不约而同的呢？这一连串的问号，又怎样从“劳动成果”中作“肯定”的答复呢？
    其实“一二三四………怎样来的？”只要让发问的学生，伸出他的两只手来，那学生便可理解问题的大部了。恩格斯在反杜林论第一编哲学中，曾简单明确的说过：“人们最初从十个指头学习计算，就是说，作第一次的算术的计算。”这就是说，人类最初计算“劳动成果”，非用自己这十个指头不可。不用这双手便无法“体会”；无法“由具体到抽象”；更无法创造数字，创造十进位的数字。今天的儿童在练习加法时，也常常用手指来屈伸。这虽是众所尽知的小事，然而更可证明恩格斯对这一论点的正确了。
    我以为解答学生所提出的“一二三四……是怎样来的”这个问题时，应该这样说，似乎比较正确些：“人类最初是集体劳动，而数字随语言的发生，渐为劳动人们创造了出来。怎么创造的呢？就是当人们计算他们的劳动成果（实际他们计算的对象，当不止此，如伙伴、工具等）时，必须用自己的十个指头来进行计算。有五只羊，便伸出五个指头；五个果实，便伸出五个指头。这样日久天长，愈来愈熟，恩格斯还说：“要作计算，不但应有要被计算的对象，而且还应有这样的能力……，可是这种能力，正是长久的历史发展及经验的产物”。而用语言将所伸出手指的数目，定出了声音。至于十一、十二、十三、十四……二十、三十、四十、一百、一千、一万等数字，只不过是从一到十的推演罢了。当然这种推演是需要很长的时间的。”
