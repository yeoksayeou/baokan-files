Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 7th: The People's Liberation Army's Central Route Army on the Guangxi front, in coordination with the Eastern and Southern Route Armies, is encircling and annihilating the main force of the White bandits. From November 27th to December 4th, they successively recaptured five cities including Xiuren, Xiangxian, Wuxuan, Guixian, and Hengxian, capturing over 8,000 bandits including Wang Jingsong, Deputy Commander of the Third Corps. After sweeping through the towns along the Xiang-Gui Railway and liberating Guilin, the capital of Guangxi Province, the Central Route Army sped south from between Guilin and Liuzhou on the 27th of last month, setting up a dense interception network, causing the fleeing bandits to fall into our army's inescapable net everywhere. The Central Route Army first captured the three county towns of Xiuren, Xiangxian, and Wuxuan between the 27th of last month and the 1st of this month. In the Luoxiu area northeast of Xiangxian, they annihilated the 56th Army Headquarters and the 329th Division Headquarters and two regiments directly under the "Central China Military and Political Officer's Office," one battalion of the 82nd Division of the 97th Army, the 1st Battalion of the 8th Engineer Regiment, and the Guangxi Northern Column, capturing over 4,900 bandits including Jiang Tiemin, Commander of the Guangxi Northern Column, Liu Jinyi, Deputy Commander, and Liao Yansu, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Traffic Police Headquarters. Subsequently, on the 3rd, they liberated Guixian, the sugar production center of Guangxi, and annihilated the direct units and two regiments of the 174th Division of the 46th Army during the pursuit, capturing over 2,600 bandits. On the 4th, they continued to capture Hengxian. On the 5th, they annihilated the Guizhong Military and Political District Headquarters and the Security Regiment east of Yulin, capturing over 1,000 bandits including Wang Jingsong, Deputy Commander of the Third Corps (Zhang Gan, Commander of the bandit Third Corps, was captured in Bobai on the 1st).
