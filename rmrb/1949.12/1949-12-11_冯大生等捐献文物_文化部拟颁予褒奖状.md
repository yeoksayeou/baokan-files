　　Feng Dasheng and Others Donate Cultural Relics
  　Ministry of Culture Plans to Award Certificates of Commendation
    [From Our Newspaper] Recently, Feng Dasheng and others, descendants of Mr. Feng Gongdu of Daxing County, upholding Mr. Feng's will, donated their treasured antiques and books to the People's Government. These included a jade red knife inscribed "Zhou Zhao Kang Gong," a jade hairpin, two stone screens, rubbings of inscriptions from the San Shi Pan and Mao Gong Ding, as well as 143 inkstones with inscriptions in bronze script, compiled by Mr. Feng during his lifetime, and 17,650 books. The cultural relics have been handed over by the responsible authority, the Ministry of Culture, to the Palace Museum for safekeeping and display; the books have been handed over to the Beijing Library for collection. In order to commend the Feng family's spirit of turning private property into public good and cherishing the people's cause, the Ministry of Culture is planning to issue certificates of commendation to commend them. Furthermore, the Feng family has entered into a storage contract with the Palace Museum for 149 ancient bronzes in their collection, which will be stored in the museum's warehouse, and has agreed to allow the Palace Museum to display these bronzes for public viewing. Mr. Feng's method of storage both ensures the safety of the antiques and makes them available to the public, which is worthy of emulation by collectors.
