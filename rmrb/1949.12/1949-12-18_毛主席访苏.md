　　Chairman Mao's Visit to the Soviet Union
    Chairman Mao Zedong's visit to the Soviet Union is a major event in the history of external relations between China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people express their great joy and excitement at the meeting between Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, because it is a symbol of the great future of Sino-Soviet friendship and a symbol of the great victory of the world's people in the struggle against imperialism.
    Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union represents the highest peak in the development of friendship between the people of the two great nations, China and the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao arrived in Moscow carrying the love and gratitude of all the Chinese people for Stalin and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people, who had suffered greatly under the aggression of various imperialists, had international friends from the first day of the Soviet Union's existence, and the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle was no longer isolated. The writings of Lenin and Stalin on China and the colonial and semi-colonial revolution, and Lenin and Stalin's assistance to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, gave the Chinese people infinite strength in their struggle against imperialism. However, when China was under the rule of reactionary forces, the development of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was restricted and hindered; only after the victory of the Chinese people's revolution broke through the imperialist eastern front, and only after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, could the Chinese people take "alliance with the Soviet Union" as the basic policy of their nation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union was the first to establish equal and friendly diplomatic relations with our country, and quickly provided important assistance to our country's economic recovery, which further made the broad masses of the Chinese people realize the Soviet Union's deep sympathy for China.
    The meeting between Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin is not only good news for the Chinese people, but also good news for the people of the world. There is no doubt that the gathering of the leaders of the two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, and the two great revolutionary giants of our time, will greatly develop the friendly cooperation between the two countries with a total population of 675 million, thereby bringing great benefits to the struggle for world peace and democracy. Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union coincides with the eve of Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday, and the combination of the two happy events further increases people's joy. We respectfully wish Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin good health, and we respectfully wish Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation a long life!

### 毛主席访苏

　　毛主席访苏
    毛泽东主席访问苏联，是中苏两国外部史上的一件大事。中国人民对于毛主席和斯大林大元帅的会见，表示极大的欢欣和兴奋，因为这是中苏友谊伟大前途的象征，这是世界人民反帝国主义斗争伟大胜利的象征。
    毛主席访问苏联，表现了中苏两大国人民友谊发展的最高峰。毛主席是带着全中国人民对于斯大林和苏联的热爱和感激而达到莫斯科的。在各帝国主义侵略之下灾难深重的中国人民，从苏联存在的第一天起，就有了国际朋友了，中国人民的革命斗争就再也不是孤立的了。列宁和斯大林关于中国和殖民地半殖民地革命问题著作，列宁和斯大林对于中国人民解放事业的援助，使中国人民在与帝国主义斗争中获得了无限的力量。但是当中国处在反动势力统治下的时候，中苏两国人民友谊的发展是受着限制和阻挠的；只有在中国人民革命胜利地冲破了帝国主义的东方战线以后，只有在中华人民共和国建立以后，中国人民才能把“联合苏联”当作自己立国的基本政策。在中华人民共和国宣告成立以后，苏联首先与我国建立了平等友好的外交关系，并迅速给与我国的经济恢复工作以重要的援助，使中国广大人民进一步认识了苏联对中国的深厚同情。
    毛主席和斯大林大元帅的会见，不但是中国人民的喜讯，而且是世界人民的喜讯。毫无疑问，中苏两大国人民领袖和当代两大革命巨人聚首一堂，必将使包括六万万七千五百万人口的两大国家的友好合作获得巨大的发展，从而使拥护世界和平民主的斗争获得巨大的利益。毛主席访苏之日，适值斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的前夕，两件喜事结合在一起，更增加了人们的欢悦。敬祝毛主席和斯大林大元帅健康，敬祝中苏友好合作万岁！
