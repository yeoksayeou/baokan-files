Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government
Report on the 1950 Northeast China Financial and Economic Plan
(Delivered at the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2, 1949)

Chairman Mao, esteemed members, comrades:

As the Central People's Government Committee is discussing the national financial budget, I would like to present a brief report on the Northeast's financial and economic plan for 1950.

First, a word about the Northeast's financial and economic situation.

Generally speaking, the Northeast's financial and economic work over the past four years (since 1946) has developed alongside military and political developments, transitioning from fully supporting the victory of the Northeast People's Liberation War to fully restoring production and supporting the entire nation. Specifically, in finance, it has progressed from gradually reducing massive deficits to striving for a balance between revenue and expenditure, from decentralization to unification, and from wartime finance to construction finance. In terms of prices, it has evolved from continuous rises and major fluctuations to striving for relative stability. In finance, it has moved from large-scale issuance to reducing issuance, to the point where finance is no longer reliant on issuance at all. In production, it has progressed from first controlling the countryside and agriculture to liberating cities and controlling industry, gradually carrying out restoration. This has been a process of arduous struggle, as well as a process of accumulating experience from a lack of it. The main key is that the situation in the Northeast underwent a fundamental change after the liberation of Shenyang in November 1948. Therefore, in finance and economics, there are favorable conditions that other regions in the country do not yet have or have less of, enabling the gradual stabilization of finance and the progressive restoration of the economy. However, these conditions can be basically achieved nationwide in one or two years.

1.  The most important condition is that there is no more war within the Northeast. The entry of a million-strong army into the pass has reduced a large amount of expenditure in finance, especially in currency payments and daily necessities. The number of military and government personnel detached from production is less than in any other region of the country. Many cadres are already leading production. Honored veterans, prisoners of war, and criminals are gradually participating in production. In 1950, the troops in the Northeast will also engage in production. Therefore, in finance, a portion of the revenue can be extracted and invested in production. People of all classes, especially farmers, no longer bear the burden of war service. Under the developing military and political situation nationwide, they can all settle down and devote themselves to production.

2.  The Northeast has relatively rich resources and a relatively large industrial base. Although it has suffered war damage, it has not experienced the pain of twelve years of war like other parts of the country, so the existing foundation for restoring production is larger. In addition, transportation within the territory has been fully restored, and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and the regulation of materials are much more convenient than the current situation in other parts of the country. Furthermore, the proportion of the state-owned economy, which occupies a leading position in the national economy, is larger than in other parts of the country. Therefore, restoring and organizing the economy can be more planned, reduce blindness, and reduce the anarchic state of production and the market. This is one of the conditions for the relatively rapid recovery of the Northeast's economy.

3.  Land reform in the Northeast has been fully completed. After land reform, farmers and workers have high enthusiasm for production after the democratization of production management and the improvement of working conditions and living standards. Although farmers' lives are still quite difficult and their burdens are still heavy, and workers' wages are also lower than in other parts of the country, the lives of both workers and peasants are gradually improving year by year due to the absence of war service burdens and the government's active policy of supporting farmers' production and restoring industry. Taking the ratio of grain to cloth as an example, the amount of cloth that farmers can exchange for one ton of sorghum this year has increased by 200 percent compared with the winter of 1946, and the quality of the cloth has also improved. As for workers' wages, the wages in 1949, due to the annual increases over the past three years, have increased by 75 percent compared with 1947; the salaries of technicians have increased by 110 percent annually over the past three years. Workers' salaries will continue to increase next year. In the past three months, under the guidance and urging of Chairman Mao, and with reference to the experience of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, 63 cities with a population of more than 30,000 have held people's representative conferences, mainly to solve the problems of labor-capital relations and taxation, promulgate regulations, and conclude collective contracts, so that labor-capital relations have been resolved. In terms of taxation, through the people's representative conferences, we explained the taxation policy in the Common Program: in terms of tax rates, the burden on urban industrialists and businessmen is much lighter than that on farmers; at the same time, we simplified the taxation methods, implemented democratic evaluation by various industries, and decided to collect business tax quarterly. Therefore, the problems of labor-capital relations and public-private relations have been specifically resolved. The enthusiasm of both labor and capital has been improved.

4.  Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Northeast People's Government adopted some specific measures in the economy in 1949, thus relatively stabilizing prices and finance, and the national economy was able to move forward a little.

First, the restoration of the economy, especially industry, was taken as the overriding center. In the industrial sector, state-owned enterprises have on average restored 35 percent of the total production volume during the puppet Manchukuo period. Agricultural production plans have resulted in reduced grain production this year in the Northeast due to drought in the north and flooding in the south. Therefore, the grain situation in the Northeast next year is not optimistic and needs to be adjusted in a planned manner. State commercial organs are using appropriate price policies to increase grain prices and purchase farmers' grain. In short, thanks to the recovery of industry and the purchase of farmers' surplus grain, the state has mastered materials, which has both the appropriate strength to regulate market prices and the strength to support the needs of other parts of the country.

Second, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, in order to enable the Northeast to seize the time after the end of the Liberation War, it was decided to start restoring production in the Northeast, especially industrial production, so as to create favorable conditions for the development of industry in the whole country. Therefore, the Northeast decided to adopt a separate monetary system, issuing Northeast local currency, and temporarily not unifying it with the national currency system. This reduced the impact of the national wartime finance on the Northeast and facilitated the restoration of production in the Northeast. This measure is temporary and only a special measure when the country is still in wartime. When the national war ends and turns to construction, this measure should be abolished.

Third, various methods were adopted to organize and expand currency withdrawal. The first is to rectify urban taxation, adjust tax rates, simplify tax collection methods, and eliminate tax evasion, thereby increasing tax revenue and ensuring currency income. The second is that state-owned commercial departments plan to order goods domestically and internationally in kind in order to regulate the market and withdraw currency in other parts of the country. The third is to implement partial in-kind payments and implement wage vouchers to reduce cash payments. The fourth is to manage cash. The cash of all public enterprises and institutions must be deposited in the bank, and the transactions of public institutions and enterprises must be transferred through the bank. The monthly cash payments of each economic department must be reviewed and approved by the Financial and Economic Committee. The fifth is to issue public bonds. The sixth is for banks to raise interest rates and reward deposits and savings. Through these measures, the relative stability of prices this year has been achieved. In 1947 and 1948, the amount of currency issued was quite large, and prices continued to rise, and from March to April and July to August, price fluctuations were sometimes large (similar to the current situation in other parts of the country). The basic reason is that the war is developing, the troops are expanding, and war expenses are constantly increasing. With little income, we have to rely on issuance. (Next year's national budget is much better than the situation in Northeast China in 1948.)

Second, the financial budget and production policy for 1950

Due to the above-mentioned favorable conditions, the Northeast's financial budget for 1950 has already been calculated in the state's overall budget and will not be discussed in detail. Only one issue will be explained, namely the issue of financial policy. The Northeast's financial policy for 1950 is based on the following three points:

1.  Strive for a balance between revenue and expenditure. 2. Combine with the national policy to support national victory. 3. Tighten our belts, concentrate our efforts, and invest in production, especially heavy industry.

The main goals of industrial and agricultural production in the Northeast in 1950 are: industry focuses on restoring heavy industry, especially steel, electricity, machinery, and chemicals, so that the Northeast's industry can be restored to the 1944 level within three years, and be transformed during the restoration to make it suitable for the country's independent and autonomous industrial requirements. Implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, in order to develop private enterprises. In agriculture, the focus is on increasing grain production and expanding cotton production. The methods are for the government to supply improved seeds, build water conservancy projects, and the bank to implement agricultural loans to solve the farmers' production difficulties. Organize farmers to help each other in production and increase farmers' enthusiasm for production.

Finally, I fully support the central government's national financial budget proposal for next year. This proposal shows that the newly established Central People's Government, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has a direction and a method for the country's finances, and is able to overcome the difficulties in victory. According to the development situation of the national military and politics, according to the experience of the Northeast, and according to this plan, we will intensify our efforts and implement it, and we can strive for the new China to embark on the road of construction in one or two years. We have the confidence to strive to complete and exceed the tasks assigned to the Northeast in the national financial budget.

　　东北人民政府李富春副主席
    关于一九五零年东北财政经济计划的报告
    （一九四九年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上）
    毛主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    当此中央人民政府委员会讨论全国财政概算的时候，我谨将一九五○年东北的财政经济计划，作一简要报告。
    第一、先说一点东北的财政经济状况。
    东北四年来（从一九四六年开始）的财经工作，总的说，是随着军事、政治的发展而发展的，是从以全力支援东北人民解放战争胜利转到以全力恢复生产支援全国。具体的说，在财政上，是从逐渐减少庞大的赤字，达到力争收支平衡，是从分散到统一，从战时财政转到建设财政。在物价上，是从不断的上涨与大波动，达到力争相对的稳定。在金融上，是从大量发行走到减少发行，以至财政完全不靠发行。在生产上，是从先掌握乡村与农业，达到解放城市，掌握工业，而逐步进行恢复。这是一个艰苦奋斗的过程，也是一个由缺乏经验到积累经验的过程。主要的关键，在于东北从一九四八年十一月沈阳解放后，情况起了基本变化。故在财经上，有了比全国其他地区现在所没有或少有的有利条件，能使财政逐渐稳定，经济逐步恢复。但这些条件，一年或二年之后，在全国范围也就可以基本上争取了。
    一、最主要条件，是东北境内已无战争。百万大军入关，在财政上，特别在货币支付上与日常用品上，减少了大量的支付，脱离生产的军政人员，比全国任何地区为少。许多干部已领导生产。荣誉军人，俘虏，犯人，均逐渐参加生产。一九五○年，在东北的部队亦将从事生产。因之，在财政上，能够抽出一部收入，投入生产。各阶层人民，特别是农民，已无战争勤务的负担。在全国军事的政治的发展形势下，均能安定以全力从事生产。
    二、东北有比较丰富的资源，工业基础比较大。虽然经过战争的破坏，但不象关内各地有十二年之久的战争痛苦，因而恢复生产的现成基础较大。加之，境内交通完全恢复，城乡内外的交流与物资的调剂，比关内现在的情况便利得多。另外，就是国民经济中居领导成分的国营经济的比重，较之关内为大。因此，恢复与组织经济可以更带计划性，减少盲目性，减少生产与市场的无政府状况。这是东北经济比较迅速恢复的条件之一。
    三、东北土地改革已全部完成。农民经过土改，工人经过生产管理的民主化与劳动条件及生活的改善，生产热忱很高。虽然农民生活还相当苦，负担还重，工人的工资亦比关内其他地方低，但由于没有了战勤负担，而政府又采取了积极扶持农民生产与恢复工业的政策，工农的生活都一年比一年逐步上升。以粮食与布的比价为例，今年农民的一吨高粱所换的布，与一九四六年冬季比较，已提高百分之二百，而布的质量亦提高了。就工人的工资说，一九四九年的工资，由于三年来的逐年增加，已比一九四七年增高百分之七十五；技术人员的薪水三年来已逐年增加百分之一百一十。明年的工薪还将继续增加。最近三个月来，三万人口以上的城市，在毛主席的指示与督促下，参照京、津、上海等地的经验，有六十三个城市开了人民代表会议，主要是解决了劳资关系问题与税收问题，颁布了条例，订立了集体合同，使劳资关系获得解决。在税收的方面，我们经过人民代表会议，说明共同纲领中的税收政策：在税率上，城市工商业者的对国家的负担比农民轻得多；同时，简化了税收方法，实行各行业的民主评议，决定按季征收营业税。因此，劳资关系与公私关系问题得到了具体解决。劳资双方积极性都提高了。
    四、东北人民政府在毛主席的领导下，一九四九年在经济上采取了一些具体措施，因而使物价金融相对地稳定，国民经济能向前长了一寸。
    首先是，是把恢复经济，特别是工业，作为压倒一切的中心。在工业方面，国家企业平均恢复了伪满时生产总量的百分之三十五。农业生产计划因今年东北北旱南潦，粮食减产。因此，明年东北的粮食情况不容乐观，要作有计划的调整。国家商业机关，正以恰当的价格政策，提高粮价，购买农民粮食。总之，由于工业的恢复与对农民余粮的购买，使国家掌握了物资，既有适当力量调剂市场物价，又有力量来支持关内的需要。
    其次，是根据毛主席的指示，为着使东北在解放战争结束后，争取时间，即能着手恢复东北生产，特别是工业生产，为全国工业的发展造成有利条件，因此决定东北采取了单独的货币制，发行东北地方流通券，暂不与全国币制统一。这就减少了全国战时财政对东北的影响，便利了东北从事生产的恢复。这种措施是暂时的，只是全国还处于战时情况下的特殊措施。待全国战争结束转到建设时，此种措施即应取消。
    再次，是采取各种办法，组织与扩大货币回笼。第一是整理城市税收，调整税率，简化收税方法，杜绝偷漏，从而增加了税收，保障了货币的收入。第二是国营商业部门，有计划地向国内国外以实物定货，以便在内地调剂市场，回笼货币。第三是实行部分实物付款，实行工薪券，减少现金支付。第四是管理现金。一切公营企业及机关的现金，必须存入银行，公营机关企业的来往经过银行转帐。各经济部门，每月现金支付，必须经财经委员会审核批准。第五是发行公债。第六是银行提高利息，奖励存款与储蓄。经过这些措施，争取了今年物价的相对稳定。而一九四七年与一九四八年则是货币发行量相当大，物价不断上涨，而且每到三、四月，七、八月物价波动有时大波动（与关内现在情况一样）。基本原因，就是战争发展，部队扩大，战费不断增加，收入不多，不得不靠发行。（全国明年的预算，与一九四八年东北情况相比，要好多了。）
    第二、一九五○年的财政预算及生产方针
    由于具备了上述的有利条件，关于一九五○年东北的财政预算，已经计算在国家总的预算中，不再详说。只说明一个问题，即财政方针问题。东北一九五○年财政方针是根据下列三点结合：
    一、力争收支平衡。二、与全国方针结合，以支援全国胜利。三、节衣缩食，集中力量，投资生产，特别是重工业。
    一九五○年东北工农业生产的主要目标是：工业以恢复重工业为主，特别是钢铁、电力、机械与化学，以便在三年之内使东北工业恢复到一九四四年的水平，并在恢复中加以改造，使之适合于国家工业独立自主的要求。贯彻公私兼顾与劳资两利方针，以发展私人企业。在农业方面，则着重于增产粮食，扩大棉花生产。方法是政府供给优良种子，兴修水利，银行实行农贷，以解决农民的生产困难。组织农民生产互助，提高农民生产积极性。
    最后，我完全拥护中央政府明年全国财政概算方案。这一方案，表示新成立的中央人民政府，在毛主席领导之下，对国家财政是有方针有办法的，是能够克服胜利中的困难的。根据全国军事政治发展的形势，根据东北的经验，照这个方案，加紧努力，贯彻实施，可以争取新中国在一、二年之后走上建设的大道。我们有信心争取完成与超过全国财政概算中所给予东北任务。
