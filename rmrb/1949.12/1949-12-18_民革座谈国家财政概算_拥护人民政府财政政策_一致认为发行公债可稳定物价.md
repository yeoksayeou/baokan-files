　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held an enlarged symposium on the 8th to report and discuss the Central People's Government's approved 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget and the issuance of Victory Index-Linked Bonds. A total of forty-two members and staff of the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Committee attended the symposium, which was presided over by Li Jishen. First, Wang Kunlun, a member of the Central Committee of the Committee, made a report entitled "Striving to Stabilize Prices, Balance Revenue and Expenditure, Implement the Budget, and Promote Public Bonds." Subsequently, Li Renren, Li Shijun, and more than ten others spoke enthusiastically, unanimously agreeing that the government's establishment of the budget and issuance of public bonds are manifestations of responsibility to the people and are timely measures. Judging from the percentage of each item in the budget expenditure, it can further guarantee the complete victory of the war and the gradual recovery of production; in terms of income, the percentage of public grain is the largest, followed by various taxes, which is taken from the people and used appropriately. Issuing public bonds to make up for part of the budget deficit and reducing the issuance of currency is an effective way to stabilize prices. At the same time, both issuance and repayment are calculated on an index-linked basis, so that the people do not suffer losses. The target of the issuance is focused on industry and commerce, the burden is reasonable, and the considerations are also thorough. All democratic parties and the people of the whole country will surely support such a correct fiscal policy. Finally, Li Jishen concluded that the next year's budget and the issuance of public bonds are major national events, and after we have a correct and thorough understanding, we must further carry out widespread publicity. Symposia will continue to be held after this one, and I hope everyone will continue to study.

　　民革座谈国家财政概算
    拥护人民政府财政政策
    一致认为发行公债可稳定物价
    【新华社北京十五日电】中国国民党革命委员会于八日举行扩大座谈会，报告并讨论中央人民政府通过的一九五○年度国家财政收支概算和发行胜利折实公债。出席座谈会者有该委员会中央及北京市分会委员、职员共四十二人，由李济深主持。首由该委员会中央委员王昆仑作了“为稳定物价平衡收到执行概算推销公债而斗争”的报告。接着李任仁、李世军等十余人热烈发言，一致认为：政府成立概算和发行公债，是对人民负责任的表现，是适合时宜的措施。从概算支出各项目所占的百分比看，可以更进一步地保证战争的完全胜利和生产的逐步恢复；收入方面百分比以公粮为最大，其次为各项税收，这是取之于民，而用之于得当的。发行公债，弥补概算赤字的一部，减少货币的发行，这是稳定物价的有效办法。同时发行偿还，均以折实计算，使人民不吃亏。发行的对象着重在工商业，负担合理，也照顾周到。这样正确的财政政策，各民主党派及全国人民一定会拥护的。最后，李济深总结说：明年的概算和发行公债是国家的大事，我们有了正确彻底的了解后，进一步要展开普遍的宣传。座谈会以后还要继续举行，希望大家继续研究。
