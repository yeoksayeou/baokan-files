　　Regarding the Protection of Children's Rights
    Summary of Report by Indian Representative Amita Devi
    Dear friends!
    We, the women of India, are sincerely grateful to our great Women's International Democratic Federation for giving us this opportunity to report to this historic conference and launch a discussion on protecting the rights of our most precious possession - our children.
    Our hearts are filled with joy and pride when we see the children of the Soviet Central Asian Republics growing up under the care of the state, flourishing into adulthood; when we see the faces of children in the People's Republics of China, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Korea showing the first gleams of a happy childhood.
    It is astonishing to see children in colonial and dependent countries still able to survive, smile, and maintain their brilliance and wisdom in the terrible abyss of poverty, degradation, and inhuman exploitation.
    Those who harm our children are the imperialists and their lackeys, the parasitic wealthy and reactionary capitalists. They want to enslave the whole world, to seize all profits, all enjoyment, and security, even at the cost of the blood of the most fragile and tender children.
    Overthrowing Imperialism is the Path to Happiness, Education, and a Bright Future
    The solution to the children's problem is closely linked to the liberation of the people of colonial and dependent countries from imperialist oppression, and to the establishment of people's democratic regimes in Asian countries. The situation of children in the Soviet Central Asian Republics is clear evidence of this.
    In a letter to the great Stalin on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Kazakh Republic, the Kazakh people wrote:
    "Before the establishment of the Soviet regime, the life of our people was like a spring without flowers, a day without sunshine, a river without water. Precious metals were hidden in the earth, but people tilled the virgin land with the most primitive wooden plows. The vast lake shores and riverbanks overflowed with life-giving water from mountain glaciers, but people died of thirst. In winter, our pastures were covered with ice, and our nomadic cattle and sheep, on which our lives depended, starved to death. From birth, living, to death, people never knew what a great human life was. The entire people were overwhelmed by the heavy burden of a fate as harsh as a blizzard in the wilderness."
    Such was the life of the people living on the eastern frontiers of Tsarist Russia.
    The great October Revolution forever ended the powerlessness, poverty, oppression, and ignorance of the various nationalities of Russia. For the first time in their long history, the Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tajik, and Turkmen peoples gained national independence and national sovereignty.
    These nations, which have gained national freedom and established socialist societies, have created conditions for their children that advanced people in the past could only dream of. Children's education has become a matter of special and great concern in these countries, and there is not a village without its own school, nursery, and kindergarten, as well as summer children's recreation and playgrounds. In these countries, there is not a district capital without maternity hospitals, child welfare stations, milk factories, several secondary schools and primary schools, as well as various facilities for pre-school children, children's hospitals, children's libraries, children's sports fields, and children's cinemas.
    Motherhood, from the heavy burden of past suffering, has been transformed into a noble and respected duty of women.
    In those countries where the people have driven out the foreign enslavers, overthrown the rule of feudalism and the comprador bourgeoisie, and established people's democratic states, excellent conditions have been created or are being created for children. One of the primary measures of the democratic government is to strive to improve the living conditions of children. The People's Republics of China, Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam all protect the interests of women and infants by law.
    When the People's Liberation War was still raging fiercely, welfare and education for children had already begun in the vast liberated areas of China. Now, with the founding of the People's Republic of China, an even happier prospect is unfolding before the children of China. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: to promote health and medical services, and to pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children.
    The People's Government pays great attention to the development of national education, one of the concrete measures being the establishment of free education for the children of the working people.
    The orphans of martyrs who died in the Liberation War are given priority by the government to be sent to schools and nurseries. In several major cities that have been liberated, nurseries have been set up for female workers and professional women, three-quarters of which were established after liberation.
    At present, the People's Government is adopting various plans to open nurseries, kindergartens, and children's medical institutions in various places, and to systematically develop children's education.
    Various measures have been taken to prohibit child labor and limit the working hours of young workers.
    In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the problem of nurturing the younger generation is also being successfully solved. The law of the state prohibits child labor, and the working hours of young workers are stipulated as six hours.
    From 1950, free compulsory education will be implemented for all children. General schools, secondary vocational schools, and institutions of higher learning are increasing year by year.
    In 1945, in North Korea, which had just been liberated, there was not a single university. Now there are fifteen. The number of general schools and specialized schools has increased sixfold, and the number of students has increased fifteenfold. Before 1945, only 20 percent of the people in the country were literate, now 98 percent are literate, and women and infant welfare agencies have started working for the first time in history.
    The Mongolian People's Republic has made significant progress in the work of protecting and nurturing children. The use of child labor is prohibited in all sectors of the people's economy in this country. The health care of the working people and their children is guaranteed by the constitution, which also stipulates free medical care. The republic has a series of state-run children's institutions: nurseries, kindergartens, sanatoriums, children's palaces, and Young Pioneer homes. According to the republic's five-year plan, by 1952 the number of nurseries will double that of 1940, and the number of kindergartens will increase sixfold compared to the present. The state laws of the Mongolian People's Republic stipulate and guarantee free compulsory education for children. Students in secondary and higher education can receive free food, lodging, and supplies.
    Before the 1921 revolution, Mongolia had only one public school established for the children of feudal lords and princes. Now Mongolia has five hundred middle and primary schools, fifteen technical schools, and universities.
    The Democratic Government of Vietnam, in the short span of three years, has achieved great success in education. Under French rule, 90 percent of the people were illiterate, now 90 percent of the people can read and write.
    In the liberated areas of Vietnam, there are already 2,142 primary schools, 32 secondary schools, and 5 universities. Although the war is still going on, the state has created conditions so that every village community has a school.
    The experience of the people of Mongolia, China, Korea, Vietnam, and especially the Soviet Central Asian Republics, clearly demonstrates how great success can be achieved in improving the lives of children after the working people of colonial and dependent countries have shaken off the shackles of imperialism and feudalism and become masters of their own destiny. These people's experiences powerfully demonstrate that nurturing children is a major undertaking of the state, and only governments that consistently uphold the interests of the working people can successfully solve this issue.
    The Suffering of Our Children in Colonial and Dependent Countries
    Among the many evils of imperialism that can be enumerated, its greedy exploitation of child labor in colonial and dependent countries is one of the most shameful.
    In colonial and dependent countries, there are virtually no laws to protect the rights of children.
    India is a typical example. India is one of the richest countries in the world, yet today, the people of India are among the poorest in the world.
    According to a report published by the Indian Government Labor Investigation Committee in 1946, in 72 tea gardens in the Duars area alone, child labor accounted for 25.7 percent of the total number of workers, and in Gwalior child labor accounted for 71 percent.
    It is difficult to find a village, or an industry, in which child labor is not being exploited. They work ten to fourteen hours a day and never know what a holiday means!
    The Middle East and Near East countries are extremely rich in mineral resources. They have 42 percent of the world's oil reserves. However, the children of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon live in appalling poverty. They work as much as adults, but receive wages close to zero!
    In Iran, children over the age of four have joined the ranks of the vast starving Iranian people to make a "living"! The famous Iranian carpets that adorn the living rooms of the world's wealthy are woven with the lives of Iranian children.
    The lives of the Iranian people and children are heartbreaking. Poverty has become so severe that in Kerman province, parents often gather their children together to sell them, sometimes for only 300 francs each. Parents do this to avoid leaving them at home to starve to death!
    The prevalence of child trafficking in Saudi Arabia fully illustrates the terrible suffering inflicted on the people by the greedy rulers of Saudi Arabia! Children between the ages of three and eight are either abducted or sold because their parents are too poor to survive. These child traffickers then sell the children to big factory owners and landlords.
    The rulers of Turkey simply do not announce any laws to prohibit child labor. Children here work 14 hours a day, all year round, without the right to even one day off. Children between the ages of eight and ten account for 5 percent of all textile workers in Turkey.
    The living conditions of children in the unliberated areas of Vietnam are even worse. A progressive journalist who visited the unliberated areas of Vietnam wrote: "Yesterday, an eighteen-year-old young woman wanted to exchange her own baby for five Vietnamese dong with me. The translator explained to me that this winter the market price for children in the countryside has fallen to one and a half Vietnamese dong." The French colonialists have squeezed the Vietnamese people to this point!
    The situation of Japanese children is no different from that in other places. When female workers are working in front of the textile machines in textile factories, their children stand beside them. From the age of one to six, children also have to stand in front of the textile machines to "help their mothers," doing this for several years without receiving any wages.
    In order to cover up the essence of the American occupation of Japan, MacArthur issued a decree in February 1946 abolishing the prostitution system and prohibiting the sale of girls to brothels. However, the sale of girls has not decreased, but has increased a lot. Today, there are already 400,000 young Japanese women who have been sold to brothels.
    In the "independent Philippines" so vigorously promoted by the United States, one can see hungry children starting to work as slaves on the plantations of gold magnates at a very young age.
    In Ceylon, according to government surveys, the minimum cost of living for each family is five and a half rupees. However, the wages of male workers are only 1.3 rupees, and the wages of female workers are only 1.1 rupees. The wages of child labor are much lower than those of female workers.
    On the plantations of Malaya, you can see little girls of seven or eight years old, breathing hard and pitifully carrying large buckets of rubber sap. The situation in Burma and Indonesia is the same. The imperialist intervention wars in these three countries have brought unspeakable disasters to the lives of their working people, especially the lives of children.
    The colonial system has brought disease, death, and hunger to our children
    In the Soviet Republics of Central Asia and the People's Democratic countries of Asia, the health of children is a matter of primary concern to the state, whereas in countries ruled by imperialism, "protecting the health of children" only protects the health of wealthy people's children at the expense of the brutal exploitation of the health of millions of children of the colonized.
    For example, in India as a whole, there are only 600 maternity hospitals and similar institutions to protect the health of women and children for a population of 400 million. But they are all for the use of the rich. Because women do not have maternity leave, many women give birth in factories, plantations and fields, so many children are born disabled.
    The life expectancy of the people of India, with the exception of Ceylon, is the shortest in the world. Fifty percent of the population dies before the age of fifteen.
    Due to extreme poverty and malnutrition, the mortality rate of children under the age of five in Ceylon accounts for 55 percent of the total number of deaths.
    In Indonesia, there is only one doctor for every 100,000 people, and the mortality rate of Indonesian children is as high as 40 percent. In places like Yogyakarta, the child mortality rate is as high as 80 percent.
    Due to the lack of basic hygiene and malnutrition, 99 percent of the children of the working people in Iran suffer from tuberculosis, stomach ulcers, trachoma and other terrible diseases, resulting in a child mortality rate of 80 percent and an infant mortality rate of 90 percent.
    It is absurd to dream of the children of the working people in these countries receiving welfare from the current reactionary regime. The hands of foreign colonialists and their lackeys are stained with the blood of our children, and these children's bodies and minds are branded with the deep scars of imperialist brutality.
    Under colonial rule, our children are deprived of the right to education
    When it comes to culture and education, the colonial and dependent countries of Asia are the most backward in the world.
    This state is the result of the colonialists' deliberate policy of keeping the masses completely ignorant.
    In India, 87 percent of the people are illiterate.
    The Nehru government spends 50 percent of the budget on maintaining the police and "defense" measures, while education expenses account for only 3 percent.
    Last year, in just one district in Bengal, 3,000 primary school teachers were dismissed and 897 primary schools were closed.
    The situation in Burma and Malaya is exactly the same. In Burma, only one-third of children have the opportunity to attend school, while in Malaya, 75 percent of school-age children do not have the opportunity to study.
    The French colonialists built 20,000 prisons in Vietnam, which means there is one prison for every thousand people, while there is only one primary school for every 20,000 children.
    Ninety percent of the people in Iran are illiterate. In the city of Susa with a population of 30,000, only 580 children are enrolled in school. Among them, 240 suffer from trachoma, and the rest are either blind or victims of scurvy.
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has enacted legislation to protect children and taken measures to guarantee the rights of the children of the working people. However, in South Korea, under the rule of the American authorities and their lackey Syngman Rhee, education has become a tool of domination.
    The above facts are enough to prove the painful situation in which our children live and die under imperialist rule, but this report is not complete, because it does not mention the children who are tortured in prisons under the pretext of being "disloyal" to the country.
    In May of this year in India, Ramleti - a sixteen-year-old peasant leader of the South Indian Hyderabad uprising - was sentenced to death by the government of "independent" Nehru because he was unwilling to endure seeing his mothers and sisters being raped by Nehru's military police, and his compatriots dying innocently of starvation. In the United Provinces of India, 700 children between the ages of ten and sixteen were arrested because they resisted the reactionary government's policy of increasing tuition fees. The leaders of this movement were all children, who were imprisoned in solitary confinement and beaten. The same situation is happening all over India. In the rural areas of Bengal province, boys and girls are arrested, and if their parents are political workers, they are mostly subjected to torture to "confess."
    In Iran, children aged 12-16 are put in jail. Their backs are beaten black and blue in order to make them "confess". One of the children managed to write a letter to an adult he knew outside. Describing the torture he suffered, he wrote: "They twisted my arms, they whipped me, the executioners kept yelling 'Let us slaughter him' - but I still resisted, so the police had no choice." These are our children! The buds of humanity are being slaughtered, tormented, and trampled by bloodthirsty imperialism and its running dogs. Dear friends:
    There is no end to the exploitation our children suffer under imperialist rule. What we have described is enough to make all the mothers and women of Asia hate these beasts in human clothing, these imperialists.
    Look at the little workers and little farmers in rich India, who are exploited to the point of exhaustion! Look at the four-year-old children who are forced to bear the heavy burden of imperialist crimes!
    Look at the graves of Iranian children! Understand the infinite sorrow of the Iranian "slave mother," who bore twelve children, but could not save even one of them from the hands of hunger and disease.
    Talk to the mothers in Japan or Vietnam who sell their beloved daughters to brothels in order to get food.
    Try to understand the tragedy of a mother in Saudi Arabia who has to sell her child in order to keep him from starving.
    Think of the sorrow of the mothers in Vietnam, India, Malaya, and Burma, where the torn bodies of their dead children lie on the ground, testifying to the cruelty of the colonial war.
    Think of our children being shot during parades, being thrown into prison, and being tortured because they helped their parents in the struggle for bread and a better life! Remember our children fighting in Iranian prisons. Think of the situation of Indian children under the gallows and let us be proud of them.
    Only in this way can you fully recognize the depth of the crimes committed by American, British, French, and Dutch imperialists against our children in the enslaved countries of Asia.
    Let us stand up with the full dignity of women and motherhood, and let us solemnly swear to end this unnecessary killing of human life. It is a disgrace to us women and mothers, and to all humanity, that our children are still living in this way in this part of the world. In Asia, we have already liberated more than half of our children from the clutches of imperialism, and we must liberate the other half as quickly as possible.
    Arise! All the democratic people of Asian countries who are for true national independence, peace, democracy, and who want to see their children grow up into healthy, educated, and cultured citizens of independent and democratic countries. Let us unite in the struggle. All democratic people and their organizations who are striving for democracy and peace and who hope to see their children grow up in a peaceful and happy world, let us unite our strength!
    Arise! All progressive women's organizations around the world, under the banner of the great Women's International Democratic Federation, resolutely declare your solidarity with us Asian women in the struggle against imperialism, for national independence, democracy, and peace - for a peaceful world for our children! Let us unite, help each other, and do everything we can to eradicate our common enemy, to eradicate these criminals who murder our children.
    We demand:
    The realization of the principles of democracy and independence declared in the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Declaration.
    We must unite to fight against the exploitation of child labor in industry and agriculture, demand the enactment of laws prohibiting the employment of children under the age of fourteen and restricting the employment of young workers, and ensure that these laws are strictly observed, with severe penalties for violations. We must demand the protection of child labor from all forms of exploitation and demand strict compliance with these laws.
    All this can only become a reality when our people earn enough living wages. Therefore, we must demand and fight for living wages for the working people, so that they will not be forced to send their children to work.
    We must rise up to protect the rights of working mothers.
    We must demand and fight for increased funding for education and public health, and for the implementation of compulsory free education.
    In order to achieve the above demands, we must resolutely carry out the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs.
    All the people on our continent are rising up to meet the dawn of freedom. We have already heard the happy laughter of our children in the Soviet Republics of Central Asia, and have seen their joyful faces in the People's Republics of China, Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam. We have fought, we are fighting, and we will continue to fight until People's Republics are established in every country in Asia, where our children will no longer work like slaves, will have every opportunity to develop into true citizens of their country, be educated, cultured, and happy.
    Long live the Women's International Democratic Federation, which has consistently and resolutely fought for the rights of children around the world!
    Long live the Asian Women's Representative Conference!
    Forward! Towards the happiness of our children!

　　关于保卫儿童权利
    印度代表阿米塔·台维报告摘要
    【新华社北京十五日电】亚洲妇女代表会议十四日下午由印度代表阿米塔·台维作“保护儿童权利的报告”。兹摘要如下：亲爱的朋友们！
    我们印度妇女衷心地感谢我们伟大的国际民主妇女联合会，给予我们这样的机会，向这个历史性的会议作报告，来展开关于保卫我们最珍贵的财产——我们的儿童的权利的讨论。
    当我们看到中亚细亚苏维埃各共和国的儿童在国家的关怀下成长起来，一直到成年焕发的时候；当我们看到中国、蒙古、越南以及朝鲜等人民共和国的儿童脸上现出幸福童年的最初光辉的时候，我们的内心充满了愉快与骄傲。
    当我们看到殖民地与附属国家里的儿童在贫困、堕落与非人的剥削的可怕深渊中，仍然能够生存，微笑，并保持着他们的光辉与智慧，这不能不使人感到惊异。
    那些残害我们儿童的人，就是帝国主义及其走狗寄生的豪富与反动资本家。他们要奴役整个世界，要攫夺一切利润、一切享受和安全，甚至不惜牺牲最脆弱、最温柔的儿童的鲜血。
    推翻帝国主义是走向幸福、教育与光明未来的道路
    儿童问题之解决是与殖民地附属国人民由帝国主义压迫下解放出来，及在亚洲各国建立人民民主政权的问题紧密联系着的。苏联在中亚细亚各共和国的儿童状况可作这一问题的明证。
    哈萨克人民于该共和国成立二十五周年时给伟大的斯大林的信里写道：
    “在苏维埃政权建立以前，我们人民的生活象没有花的春天，没有阳光的白天，没有水的江河一样。在大地中蕴藏着宝贵的金属，但人们却以最原始的木犁耕着处女地。广阔的湖岸和江岸边洋溢着来自山间冰河的生命之流水，而人却因干渴而死亡。在冬天的时候，我们的牧场被冰层所覆盖，我们的生命所唯一依托的游牧牛羊饿死了。人从出生、活着以至死亡，一向不知道什么是伟大的人间生活。全体人民在象旷野暴风雪般严酷的命运的重担下压倒了。”
    居住在沙皇罗斯东部边疆人民的生活就是这样的。
    伟大的十月革命永远结束了俄罗斯各民族之无权、困苦、被压迫和愚昧。哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、乌兹别克、达吉克斯和土库曼等各民族在自己悠久的历史上第一次获得了民族独立和国家主权。
    这些获得了民族自由和建立了社会主义社会的民族替自己的儿童创造了先进的人们过去所只能梦想的条件。儿童的教育成为这些国家所特别和巨大关怀的事情，在这些国家中，没有一个村庄没有自己的学校、托儿所和幼稚园，还有暑期的儿童健身场和游戏场。在这些国家中，没有一个区的首府没有产科医院、儿童福利站、牛奶厂、几所中等学校和初级学校，此外还有学龄前儿童的各种设备、儿童医院、儿童图书馆、儿童运动场和儿童电影院。
    做母亲，由过去的沉重苦楚的负担，转变为高尚的和受尊敬的妇女义务。
    在那些人民已经赶走了外国奴役者，推翻了封建主义和买办资产阶级的统治并建立了人民民主国家的国度里，已为儿童们创设了或正在创造着优良的条件。民主政府首要的措施之一便是极力改善儿童的生活条件。中国、蒙古、朝鲜及越南各人民共和国都以法律保卫妇婴的利益。
    当人民解放战争还在非常剧烈地进行着的时候，在中国广大的解放区内即已着手开展儿童的福利与教育事业。现在，随着中华人民共和国的成立，在中国儿童面前展开了一幅更加幸福的远景。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领上明确地规定：要推广卫生医药事业，并注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。
    人民政府非常注意发展国民教育，其中具体措施之一就是为劳动人民的子弟设立免费教育。
    在解放战争中牺牲的烈士遗孤，由政府优先送至学校与托儿所。在解放了的几个大城市中，已为女工及职业妇女设立了托儿所，其中四分之三是解放后成立的。
    目前人民政府正采取着各种方案，以便在各地开办托儿所、幼稚园及儿童医疗机关，及有系统地发展儿童教育。
    已经采取各种措施来禁止童工和限制青工工作时间。
    在朝鲜人民共和国，抚育青年一代的问题也在成功的解决中。国家的法律禁止童工，青工工作时间被规定为六小时。
    从一九五○年起将实现使所有儿童都受免费义务教育。普通学校、中级职业学校，和高等学校都在逐年增加。
    一九四五年，在刚解放的朝鲜北部，根本就没有一座大学校。现在有十五所。普通学校和专科学校增加了六倍，就学人数增加了十五倍。一九四五年以前全国人民只有百分之二十识字，现在百分之九十八识字，并且妇婴福利机构也有史以来第一次的开始工作了。
    蒙古人民共和国在保护和抚育儿童的工作方面获得了显著的进展。这个国家内人民经济的所有部门里都禁止使用童工。劳动人民和他们的子女的保健得到宪法的保证，宪法并规定免费医疗。共和国设有一系列的国立儿童机关：托儿所、幼稚园、疗养院、儿童宫和少先队之家。按照该共和国的五年计划，到一九五二年托儿所的数目较一九四○年将增加两倍，幼稚园的数目将比现在增加六倍。蒙古人民共和国的国家法令规定与保证了儿童的免费义务教育。中等和高等学校的学生可得到免费的食宿和应用物品。
    蒙古在一九二一年革命以前，仅仅有一所为封建领主和王公的子女所设立的公立学校。现在蒙古有五百所中学和小学，十五所技术学校和大学。
    越南民主政府在短短的三年中间，已经在教育工作上得到伟大的成功。在法国统治下，百分之九十的人民是文盲，现在百分九十的人民已经能够读和写。
    在越南解放区，已经有两千一百四十二所小学，三十二所中学和五所大学，虽然战争仍在进行，国家已创造条件使每一个村社区域内都有一所学校。
    蒙古、中国、朝鲜、越南，特别是苏维埃中亚细亚各共和国人民的经验，明显地证明出：殖民地附属国家的劳动人民在摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的桎梏并成为自己命运的主人之后，在改善儿童生活方面能够达到如何巨大的成功。这些人民在经验特别有力地显示着抚育儿童是国家的重大事业，而只有那些经常维护劳动人民利益的政府才能够成功地解决这个课题。
    我们儿童在殖民地与附属国中的痛苦
    在帝国主义虽以枚举的许多罪恶中，它对于殖民地与附属国中童工的贪婪的剥削，是最可耻的罪恶之一。
    在殖民地与附属国家里，实际上就没有保障儿童权利的法律。
    印度就是一个典型的例子。印度是世界上最富饶的国家之一，然而今日，印度人民置身于世界上最贫困的人民之列。
    根据印度政府劳工调查委员会一九四六年所发表的报告，单就多尔斯一地七十二个茶园，童工就占工人总数的百分之二十五点七，在瓜里窝尔童工占百分之七十一。
    很难找到一个村庄，或者一门工业，其中没有童工在受剥削。他们每天作工十小时至十四小时，从来不知道休假是什么意思！
    中东和近东各国矿藏极其丰富。他们有全世界石油矿藏的百分之四十二。然而伊朗、伊拉克、沙特了拉伯、叙利亚、黎巴嫩的孩子们却过着令人不寒而栗的贫困的生活，他们作成人一样多的工，却只得到近于零的工资！
    在伊朗，四岁以上的幼儿就加入了广大的饥饿的伊朗人民的队伍来谋“生活”！装饰着全世界富人客厅的有名的伊朗地毯，是伊朗儿童的生命织成的。
    伊朗人民和儿童的生活说起来就是令人痛心的事，贫穷已严重到这种程度，以致在吉曼省父母们常把孩子们凑在一起出卖，有时每个只卖三百法朗。父母们这样做，为的是免得把他们留在家里饿死！
    沙特阿拉伯贩卖儿童业的盛行，充分地说明沙特阿拉伯贪婪的统治者们加在人民身上可怕的苦难！三岁至八岁的小孩们，或者被拐骗，或者是由于父母穷得走头无路，而被卖掉。那些儿童贩子再把小孩卖给大工厂老板和地主们。
    土耳其的统治者干脆不宣布任何法律来禁止童工，这里的儿童每天工作十四小时，一年到头，连休假一天的权利也没有。八岁至十岁的儿童，占全土耳其纺织工人百分之五。
    越南待解放区里儿童的生活情况则更恶劣。一个曾经访问过越南待解放区的进步记者写道：“昨天，一个十八岁的少妇要把她自己的婴儿向我换五块越币，翻译者向我解释今年冬天乡村里小孩的市价已跌到一块半越币。”法国殖民者将越南人民已经压榨到这种情况！
    日本儿童的情况，与其他地方也没有什么两样。女工在纺织工厂纺织工厂纺织机前工作的时候，孩子就站在她们身旁。一到六岁，孩子们也要站在纺织机前来“给他们的母亲帮忙”，这样做上好几年，一直得不着分文工资。
    为了掩盖美国占领日本的实质，麦克阿瑟虽于一九四六年二月。颁布法令废除娼妓制度，并禁止将女孩贩卖给妓院。但是，贩卖女孩的事不但没有减少，反而更增加了许多。今天，被卖给妓院的年轻的日本女子已经有四十万。
    在美国所极力鼓吹的“独立的菲律宾”，人们可以看见饥饿的孩子们，年纪很小就开始在金元大王的种植园里作奴隶。
    在锡兰，根据政府的调查，每个家庭最低的生活费用需要五个半卢比。而男工的工资仅一．三卢比，女工工资则仅一．一卢比。童工的工资又比女工的低得多。
    在马来亚的种植园里，你可以看到七、八岁的小女孩，气也口喘不过来地、惨不忍睹地背负着大桶橡胶汁。缅甸和印度尼西亚的情形也是一样。帝国主义在这三个国家里的干涉战争，已经给它们劳动人民的生活，尤其是儿童的生活，带来了难以言喻的灾难。
    殖民制度给我们儿童带来了疾病、死亡和饥饿
    中亚细亚在苏维埃共和国及亚洲人民民主国家里，儿童的健康成为国家主要关切的事项，而在帝国主义所统治的国家中，“保护儿童健康”只是牺牲掉被殖民者野蛮剥削的千百万儿童的健康来保护有钱人家儿童的健康。
    例如在印度全境，四万万人口中只有六百个产科医院及类似的保护妇女及儿童健康的机构。但他们都只供富有者使用。因为妇女没有生育假期，很多妇女们在工厂、种植园及田野上生产小孩，以致许多小孩生出来就是残废。
    印度人民的寿命除锡兰外是世界上最短的，百分之五十的人口在十五岁以前就死亡。
    由于极端的贫困与营养不良，在锡兰五岁以下儿童的死亡率占死亡总数的百分之五十五。
    在印度尼西亚每十万人中只有一个医生，印尼儿童的死亡率高达到百分之四十。象在日惹这样的地方，儿童死亡率高到百分之八十。
    由于缺乏起码的卫生条件及营养不良，伊朗劳动人民的儿童有百分之九十九患肺痨、肠胃溃疡、砂眼及其他可怕的疾病，结果儿童死亡率是百分之八十，婴儿百分之九十。
    要梦想劳动人民的儿童在这些国家内从现在的反动政权下得到福利是荒谬的。外国殖民者及他们的走狗的手上已染满我们儿童的鲜血，这些儿童的身上和脑海中都被烙上了帝国主义凶狠残暴的深刻伤痕。
    在殖民统治下我们的儿女被剥夺了受教育的权利
    谈到文化教育，亚洲各殖民地及附属国是全世界最落后的国家。
    这种状态是殖民者处心积虑使群众完全无知的政策所造成的。
    在印度，百分之八十七的人民是文盲。
    尼赫鲁政府把百分之五十的预算用在维持警察及“保卫”措施上，而教育费用却只占百分之三。
    去年，仅仅在孟加拉的一个区内，就有三千个初级学校教师被解职，有八百九十七座初级学校被封闭。
    缅甸及马来亚的情况也是完全一样。在缅甸，只有三分之一的儿童有进学校的机会，而在马来亚则百分之七十五的学龄儿童没有学习机会。
    法国殖民者在越南建立了二万座监狱，也就是说，一千人中有一座监牢，而二万儿童才有一所初级学校。
    伊朗百分之九十的人民是文盲。在三万人口的苏希达城中只有五百八十个儿童入学。其中二百四十人害砂眼，其余的人或者是盲目，或者是坏血病的牺牲者。
    朝鲜人民共和国制订了保护儿童的立法，并采取措施来保证劳动人民儿女的权利。可是在朝鲜南部，在美国当局及其走狗李承晚的统治下，教育变成了统治的工具。
    上述事实已经够充分地证明我们的儿童在帝国主义统治下，被置于何等痛苦的境遇中生活和死亡着，但这报告还不算完全，因为还没有提到在“不忠于”国家的借口下在监狱中受折磨的儿童们。
    今年五月在印度，兰姆莱梯——十六岁的南印海德拉巴起义的农民领袖——被“独立”的尼赫鲁的政府叛处死刑，因为他不愿再忍受看着他的母亲们及姊妹们被尼赫鲁的军警所蹂躏，以及他的同胞被无辜的饿死。在印度联合省，七百个十岁至十六岁的儿童被捕，因为他们反抗反动政府增加学费政策。这一运动的领袖都是儿童，他们被关进单人监狱受到殴打。同样的情形在全印各地都发生着。在孟加拉省的农村中，男女儿童被捕，如果他们的双亲是政治工作者，那么他们大多受到酷刑，要他们“招供”。
    在伊朗，十二——十六岁的孩子被关进监牢。他们的背被打得发青，为的是使他们“招供”。其中有一个孩子设法写了一封信给他在外面的大人。在描写他所受的酷刑时，他写到：“他们扭折我的手臂，他们鞭挞我，刽子手不断地叫‘让我们宰了他’——但我仍然抵抗，使得警察没有办法”。这就是我们的孩子！人的萌芽正在被嗜血的帝国主义及其走狗所屠杀、磨折、蹂躏。亲爱的朋友们：
    我们的孩子在帝国主义的统治下所遭受的一切压榨是说不完的。我们所叙述过的这些已经够使我们全亚洲的母亲和妇女痛恨这些衣冠禽兽，这些帝国主义者。
    看看在富饶的印度中被剥削得筋疲力尽的小工人和小农民吧！看看四岁的孩子就被迫负担起帝国主义罪恶的重担！
    看看伊朗儿童的坟墓！去理解一下伊朗“奴隶母亲”的无穷尽的悲哀吧，她生了十二个孩子，可是连一个她都没办法从饥饿与疾病的手中保全下来。
    去和日本或越南的母亲谈谈，她们将亲爱的女儿卖给妓院，为了换取饭吃。
    试去理解沙特阿拉伯一个母亲的悲剧，她为了不让孩子挨饿而不得不卖掉他。
    想想越南、印度、马来亚、和缅甸各地母亲们的悲伤。那儿，他们死去的孩子被撕裂的尸体躺在地上，成为殖民战争残忍程度的见证。
    想想我们的孩子在游行时被枪杀，被关进监狱，并受到酷刑，原因是他们帮助了他们的父母进行争取麦包及较好生活的斗争！记住我们的孩子在伊朗监狱中战斗着。想想印度儿童在绞架下的情景并且让我们因为他们而感到骄傲。
    只有这样你才能完全认识美、英、法、荷等帝国主义者在亚洲被奴役各国中，对我们的孩子所犯罪恶的深度。
    让我们用女性、母性的全副尊严站立起来，让我们庄严的宣誓来结束这种不应有的、对人的生命的残杀。在的世界的这一部分，我们的孩子仍然如此生活着，这是我们妇女和母亲的耻辱，也是全人类的耻辱。在亚洲我们已经将半数以上的儿童从帝国主义魔掌下解放出来，我们必须用最快的速度来解放那另外一半。
    起来！一切为真正民族独立和平民主和愿意看到他们的儿女成长为独立民主国家的健康的、有教养、有教育的公民的亚洲各国的民主人民。让我们团结在斗争中。一切争取民主与和平及希望自己的儿女生长在和平快乐世界中的民主人民及其组织，让我们联合起我们的力量！
    起来！全世界一切进步的妇女组织，在伟大的国际民主妇女联合会的旗帜下，坚决宣布你们和我们亚洲妇女团结一致，为反对帝国主义，为争取国家独立，民主及和平而斗争——为我们的孩子争取一个和平的世界！让我们团结起来，彼此互助，尽一切努力来铲除我们的公敌，铲除这些谋杀我们孩子的罪犯。
    我们要求：
    实现大西洋宪章及联合国宣言中所宣布的民主及独立原则。
    我们必须团结起来，为反对工农业中对童工的榨取而斗争，要求制订禁止雇用十四岁以下儿童及限制雇用少年工人的法律，并保证上述法律被严格遵守，如有违背应加严厉处罚。我们必须要求保护童工不受任何形式的压榨，并要求严格遵守这些法律。
    这一切只有当我们的人民获得足够生活的工资时才能成为事实。因此我们必须要求，并且为劳动人民争取足够生活的工资而斗争。因为这样他们才不会被迫将孩子送去做工。
    我们必须起来保护劳动母亲的权利。
    我们必须要求和斗争，以争取教育和公共卫生经费的增加，争取实现强迫免费义务教育。
    我们为了实现上述的要求，就要坚决进行反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。
    我们大陆上的全体人民都在起来迎接自由的曙光。我们已经听见我们在苏维埃中亚细亚各共和国的儿童的愉快笑声，已经看见他们在中国、蒙古、朝鲜、和越南人民共和国等地的欣喜面容。我们曾战斗过，我们正战斗着，我们还将继续战斗，直到亚洲每一个国家中都建立起人民共和国。我们的孩子在那里将不再象奴隶似地做工，将得到发展成为他们国家真正公民的一切机会，受教育，有修养，而且快活。
    为世界儿童权利一贯地坚决战斗的国际民主妇女联合会万岁！
    亚洲妇女代表会议万岁！
    前进！向着我们子女的幸福前进！
