Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 16th -- On the 14th, the People's Liberation Army annihilated the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang Huang Jie's 97th Army, specifically the 245th and 246th Regiments of the 82nd Division and the remnants of the 97th Regiment of the 33rd Division led by the 97th Army Headquarters. These bandits were attempting to cross the border into Vietnam, and were annihilated east of Zhennanguan at Gongtianshan, north of Aidian, in southern Guangxi. Over 4,000 bandits including the Deputy Commander of the 97th Army, Guo Wenhuan, were captured. The results of the battle are still being tallied.

While the People's Liberation Army was in the process of annihilating the remnant Kuomintang bandits, French imperialists dispatched four aircraft from Vietnam, intruding into our nation's airspace, and flew low and circled over Aidian. One of the aircraft even flew over the battlefield at Gongtianshan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th -- Four more Kuomintang warships have surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. On the 7th, the enemy warship "Tongxin" led by Captain Jiang Jin, surrendered to the local People's Liberation Army on the Yangtze River in Yunyang, eastern Sichuan. On the 11th, three gunboats of the enemy's "Second Naval Mobile Gunboat Unit," led by squadron leader Liu Jiasen, sailed to Nanning, Guangxi, to surrender. The aforementioned warships have been ordered to sail to designated locations.

  　国民党舰艇又有四艘投降
    【新华社华南前线十六日电】人民解放军十四日在广西南部边疆镇南关以东隘店以北的公田山歼灭企图越过国境逃入越南的国民党黄杰部残匪九十七军军部所率之八十二师二四五团、二四六团及三十三师之九十七团残部，俘匪九十七军副军长郭文焕以下四千余名，战果正清查中。
    当解放军歼灭国民党残匪的战斗正在进行中，法帝国主义竟由越南派出飞机四架，侵入我国领空，在隘店上空低飞盘旋，其中一架并飞临公田山战地的上空。
