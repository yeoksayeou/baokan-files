Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd: The National Education Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government officially opened today after three days of preparatory meetings and hearing reports on the education work situation from various regions. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, attended by 23 education leaders from twelve regions including Beijing and Tianjin, five provinces in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia, all cadres of the Ministry of Education, and representatives from relevant departments of the Central People's Government and organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Students' Federation. Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, Vice Premier Huang Yanpei, Central Government Member Xu Teli, and Vice Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee Lu Dingyi all personally attended to provide guidance.

After the opening of the conference, Minister Ma Xulun delivered the opening address. In explaining the general policy of New Democratic education, he said, "Education in New China should reflect the politics and economy of New China and serve as a tool of struggle to consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship." He further emphasized, "Because our country is a people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance, our education should also be centered on workers and peasants, and cultivate a large number of new-type intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds as the new and strong backbone of our national construction." Regarding the current specific work policy for national education work, he said, "We must achieve planned, step-by-step, and focused progress, and this is the principle of steady advancement!" Finally, he hoped that everyone would discuss the Central Ministry of Education's work plan for the first half of 1950 based on the above spirit, and address several important national issues in connection with liberation.

Next, Guo Moruo spoke. He said: The Common Program has already clearly defined our cultural and educational policies. There is no risk of error if we faithfully follow it. The remaining question is how to do it. Therefore, understanding the actual situation is absolutely necessary. He pointed out that the country's finances are currently facing temporary difficulties, and called on cultural and educational workers to make the most effective use of limited financial resources; and to vigorously mobilize urban industrialists and businessmen to enthusiastically purchase Victory Bonds. In his speech, Huang Yanpei, based on his past experience in educational work, emphasized that education workers should highly develop the people's wisdom and oppose incorrect teaching methods. Xu Teli recounted how education in the liberated areas developed from arduous struggles, and pointed out that our education work should be a mass movement, and education workers should be the leaders of this movement, and education workers should carry forward the spirit of hard work. Lu Dingyi called on education workers not to educate for the sake of education, but to serve politics and become politicians. He raised several specific issues, such as establishing worker-peasant rapid middle schools, teachers, teaching materials, summarizing the work experience in new areas, and leadership issues, and asked the conference to discuss and resolve them.

Guests who spoke included Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Academy of Sciences, Hu Yuzhi, Director of the General Administration of Publications, and Ke Zaishuo, Secretary-General of the All-China Students' Federation.

    马叙伦部长说明新教育方针
    郭沫若等相继讲话
    【新华社北京二十三日电】中央人民政府教育部召开的全国教育工作会议，经过三天预备会，听取了各地教育工作情况报告后，于今日正式开幕。上午举行开幕式，到会者有北京、天津两市、华北五省、东北、华东、华中南、西北、内蒙古等十二个地区教育负责人二十三人，教育部全体干部，及中央人民政府各有关部门和中华全国总工会、新民主主义青年团中央委员会、全国学联等团体代表，政务院副总理兼文化教育委员会主任郭沫若，副总理黄炎培，中央政府委员徐特立，文化教育委员会副主任陆定一均亲临指导。
    会议开幕后，首由马叙伦部长致开幕词。他在阐述新民主主义教育总方针时说：“新中国的教育应该是反映新中国的政治经济，作为巩固与发展人民民主专政的一种斗争工具的新教育。”他又强调的指出：“由于我们的国家是以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，因此，我们的教育也应该以工农为主体，大量地培养工农出身的新型知识分子，作为我们国家建设的新的坚强骨干。”关于全国教育工作当前具体工作方针，他说：“我们要做到有计划，有步骤，有重点，这就是稳步前进的方针！”最后，他希望大家根据上述精神来讨论中央教育部一九五○年的上半年工作计划，并以联系解放若干全国性的重要问题。
    接着由郭沫若讲话。他说：共同纲领已给我们详细规定了文化教育政策，忠实地照着去做，万无一失，留下的问题是怎样去做。因此，对实际情况的了解是绝对必要的。他指出目前国家财政正遭遇暂时性的困难，号召文教工作者，把有限的财力，作最有效的使用；并大力动员城市工商业者，踊跃购买胜利公债。黄炎培在讲话中，根据自己过去从事教育工作的经验，强调教育工作者应高度发展人民的智慧，反对不正确的教学方法。徐特立历述解放区教育是从艰苦奋斗中发展起来的，并指出我们的教育工作应是一种群众运动，教育工作者应是这个运动的领导人，教育工作者应发扬艰苦奋斗的作风。陆定一号召教育工作者不要为教育而教育，应当为政治服务，成为一个政治家。他提出几个具体问题，如创办工农速成中学、师资、教材、总结新区工作经验及领导问题，请大会讨论和解决。
    来宾讲话的有科学院副院长竺可桢、出版总署署长胡愈之、全国学联秘书长柯在铄。
