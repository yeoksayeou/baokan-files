Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th. Since the First National Congress convened in April this year, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has achieved great success in youth league building work in various regions over the past seven months. Youth League work committees have been established one after another in various regions, and Youth League representative conferences or youth work conferences have been held. Among the forty-two provinces and cities in the country that have been liberated, including thirty provinces, ten directly-administered municipalities, Inner Mongolia, and the Lushun-Dalian area, twenty-two Youth League committees or Youth League work committees have been established. The number of Youth League members has increased from 190,000 to 584,674, an increase of more than two-fold. The old liberated areas have now concluded the key stage of Youth League building and are moving towards a stage of comprehensive development. In the new areas, Youth League organizations are mostly concentrated in cities, and establishment in rural areas is just beginning. In the People's Liberation Army, in August this year, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Central Committee of the Youth League jointly issued a resolution on building the Youth League in the armed forces, deciding to begin experimental Youth League building with a focus on field armies, while Youth League building has begun universally in rear forces and military organs.

Youth League Members Play an Exemplary Leading Role in Production and Learning

After the development of Youth League work, most Youth League members have played an exemplary leading role in factories, rural areas, schools, and government offices. Youth League members in railway plants and locomotive depots in Mudanjiang, Shenyang, Huanggu屯, Jinzhou, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places took the lead and united workers to repair locomotives in their spare time. In the movement to create new production records in Northeast China, Zhao Guoyou, a Youth League member at the Shenyang Machine Factory, accelerated from taking fourteen hours to machine a turret wheel in the past to completing it in only one hour and sixteen and a half minutes, setting a new record. Youth League members from various factories and mines in Tangshan participated in flood prevention, disaster relief, and other work regardless of their own safety. Youth League member Xin Baochi heroically sacrificed himself while trying to rescue transformer oil from a rushing torrent. Youth League members at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai persisted in their work under enemy aircraft bombing. Youth League members in central Hebei, North China, publicized and motivated farmers to plant cotton, peanuts, and other crops, and took the lead in participating in various rural tasks such as pest control, flood prevention, seed selection, seed soaking, and running winter schools or public schools. In schools, the Youth League committees in large cities that had been liberated not long ago led summer learning for young students, and Youth League members played a significant role in the ideological remolding movement of young students. Many Youth League members used their vacations to participate in worker education in factories.

The Youth League's publicity and education work is also developing daily. The various Youth League committees publish approximately forty publicly distributed publications. The "China Youth" weekly published by the Central Committee of the Youth League has released twenty-eight issues, and the Central Committee of the Youth League has published five industry books. The Youth League Day system, a form of internal education, has been widely adopted in various regions and is welcomed by Youth League members. In addition, lectures, forums, Youth League classes, movie screenings, broadcasts, and various discussion meetings have been held. In order to cultivate and train a large number of young cadres, the first phase of the Youth League Central Committee School, with more than 800 people, concluded in July and August this year and were assigned to work in various regions. The first phase of more than 1,300 people then started school in August. Other regions such as Northeast China, East China, Central China, northwest Shanxi, and large cities such as Shenyang and Jinan have also established Youth League schools or training courses to train a large number of young cadres.

In terms of work with children, team building work has already begun in major cities. The "China Children" published by the Central Committee of the Youth League has released five issues.

The Youth League united the youth of the whole country and actively participated in the international democratic youth movement against imperialism for democratic peace, and sent representatives to participate in the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth held in Budapest, Hungary in September.

Overcoming Shortcomings in Youth League Building Work, Opposing Closed-Doorism and Formalism

Many Youth League organizations currently have shortcomings in their work. The first is closed-doorism in Youth League building work. Many Youth League organizations underestimate the situation of the revolutionary victory and development, as well as the degree of progress that the broad masses of young people actively demand, and fail to promptly absorb the broad masses of progressive youth into the League. Some have excessively high requirements for joining the League, using the requirements for joining the Party as the standard for joining the League. Some do not follow the procedures for joining the League stipulated in the League Constitution, but require complicated procedures such as writing an application, writing an autobiography, individual interviews, finding supporting materials, group discussions, branch review, approval by the League member assembly, and approval by the superior. Some refuse to absorb activists with more complex social relationships, and some keep the League secret for a long time, not meeting with the masses. Therefore, the development work of the League has been greatly hindered. Secondly, in the Youth League building work in individual regions, there are also tendencies of formalism and failure to publicize and combine with the central work of various regions and units, building the League for the sake of building the League. In some regions, the League's organizational life is not practical, there are too many League branch and group meetings, or they simply conduct "self-criticism." The Central Committee of the Youth League has reviewed and corrected these shortcomings in its work.

The future direction of the Youth League's work is: under the leadership of the Party, to closely relate the Youth League to all relevant parties; to cultivate a large number of League cadres in a planned and systematic manner; to find ways to solve the teaching materials for League members in factories and rural areas; to strive to overcome the closed-doorism and formalism in the Youth League's work of developing members; to carry out social service activities, and to convene a Youth Representative Conference at an appropriate time and place to strengthen the work of establishing a broad democratic youth united front; and to strengthen ties with international youth.

　　建团工作全面展开
    第一次全国代表大会后，在各省市区已建立了廿二个团委或团工委；团员增加了两倍多，已达五十八万四千余名；各地团委发行刊物四十多种；并积极参加了国际民主青年的民主和平运动。
    【新华社北京二十五日电】中国新民主主义青年团自今年四月召开第一次全国代表大会以后，七个月来，在各地建团工作上获得了很大的成绩。各地区先后都成立了青年团工作委员会，召开了青年团代表大会或青年工作会议。在全国已获解放的三十个省十个直属市及内蒙、旅大区等四十二个省市区中，已建立二十二个团委或团工委。青年团员由十九万名发形到五十八万四千六百七十四名，增加了两倍有余。老解放区目前已经结束了重点建团，正走向全面发展阶段；新区青年团的组织多集中在城市，农村正在开始建立。在人民解放军中，今年八月，中国人民革命军事委员会政治部和青年团中央委员会共同发布了关于在部队中建团的决议，决定在野战军中开始有重点的试验建团，在后方部队和军事机关中，则已普遍开始建团。
    在生产学习工作岗位上团员起了模范带头作用
    建团工作开展以后，无论在工厂、农村、学校、机关中，大部分团员都起了模范带头作用。牡丹江、沈阳、皇姑屯、锦州、徐州、开封、济南、青岛等地铁路机厂和机务段的青年团员带头并团结工人，在工余时间抢修机车。在东北创造生产新纪录运动中，沈阳机器厂青年团员赵国有自过去十四小时才能车一个塔轮，加速到只用一小时十六分半的时间就能完成，首创新纪录。唐山各厂矿的青年团员，奋不顾身地参加防汛、救灾等工作，团员信宝池为抢救急流中的变压器油而英勇牺牲。上海江南造船厂的团员在匪机轰炸下坚持工作。华北冀中的青年团员宣传并带动农民种植棉花、花生等农作物以及带头参加打虫、防汛、选种、浸种、办冬学或民众学校等各种农村工作。在学校中，解放不久的大城市中的青年团团委领导了青年学生的暑期学习，青年团员在青年学生的思想改造运动中起了很大作用。很多青年团员利用假期到工厂参加工人教育工作。
    青年团的宣传教育工作亦日益开展。各地团委所出版的公开发行的刊物约四十多种。团中央出版的“中国青年”周刊已出了二十八期，团中央所出业书已有五种。团内教育形式的团日制已为各地普遍采用，并为青年团员所欢迎。另外并举办了讲演会、讲座、团课、看电影、广播以及各种讨论会。为了培养与训练大批青年干部，青年团中央团校第一期八百余人已于今年七、八月先后结束，分配到各地工作。第一期一千三百余人继于八月开学。其他各地如东北、华东、华中、晋西北等解放区及沈阳、济南等大城市，也设立团校或训练班，训练大批青年干部。
    少年儿童工作方面，目前各大城市建队工作业已开始。团中央出版的“中国儿童”已出五期。
    青年团团结全国青年积极参加了国际民主青年反对帝国主义的民主和平运动，曾派遣代表参加九月在匈京布达佩斯召开的世界民主青年联盟第二次代表大会。
    克服建团工作中的缺点反对关门主义形式主义
    许多青年团的组织在目前的工作中存在的缺点，首先是建团工作中的关门主义。许多青年团的组织对革命胜利发展的形势以及广大青年积极要求进步的程度估计不足，不能及时地把广大进步青年吸收到团里来。有的入团条件太高，以入党的条件作为入团的标准。有的不按团章规定的入团手续，而要经过写申请书、写自传、个别谈话、找证明材料、小组讨论、支部审查、团员大会通过和上级批准等繁琐的手续。有的拒绝吸收社会关系较复杂的积极分子，有的长期把团秘密起来，不和群众见面。因此，使团的发展工作受到很大阻碍。其次在个别地区的建团工作也有形式主义和不宣传、不和各地各单位的中心工作相结合，为建团而建团的偏向。有的地区团的组织生活不切合实际，团的支部和小组会议太多，或单纯地进行“检讨批评”。青年团中央对于工作中的这些缺点，已经作了检讨并进行纠正。
    今后青年团工作努力的方向是：在党的领导下，密切青年团和各有关方面的关系。有计划有系统地大量培植团的干部，设法解决工厂、农村团员的教材；努力克服青年团发展团员工作中的关门主义、形式主义，开展社会服务活动，并在适当时机和地点召开青年代表会议，加强建立广泛的民主青年统一战线工作；以及加强和国际青年的联系。
