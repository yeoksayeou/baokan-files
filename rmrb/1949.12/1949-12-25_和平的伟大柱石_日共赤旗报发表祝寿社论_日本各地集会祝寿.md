Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th: TASS, Shanghai, December 23rd: Tokyo reports: The Japanese public widely celebrated Marshal Stalin's seventieth birthday. Branches of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association across the country held talks and report meetings about Stalin. On the 21st, the Japanese Communist Party's organ, Akahata, devoted almost its entire issue to this memorable day. Akahata published a lengthy editorial entitled "Great Pillar of Peace," and also contained essays on Stalin written by Shiga Yoshio and Nosaka Sanzo, as well as other materials.

According to Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo: On the 22nd, a mass rally was held in the auditorium of the Central Labor University in Tokyo to celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday. The conference presented Stalin with a set of Japanese translations of Stalin's various works and a letter of congratulations signed by more than 20 democratic groups, which was accepted on Stalin's behalf by an official from the Soviet delegation in Japan. Following several speeches praising Stalin's role in history, former Japanese soldiers recently repatriated from the Soviet Union sang songs such as "Stalin" and "Collective Farm Dance." The conference concluded with the screening of the color film "Siberian Symphony."
