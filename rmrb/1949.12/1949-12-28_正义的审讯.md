　　A Just Trial
    The Soviet State Procurator's Office has filed charges against Japanese war criminals Otozō Yamada, Kiyoshi Kawashima, and ten others for the serious crimes of manufacturing and using bacteriological weapons during the Japanese aggressions against China. The Naval Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Military District has begun the trial. This trial is a just measure to uphold world human morality and maintain lasting peace in the Far East and the world. We, the Chinese people, who have endured eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, feel extremely excited about this just action by our great ally, the Soviet Union, express our complete approval and support, and demand that these heinous fascist war criminals be severely punished.
    The first day of the trial has fully exposed the狰狞 face of Japanese fascism – how brutal, how insane, and how devoid of humanity they were! The trial proved that Japanese fascists, during their war of aggression against our country, organized a vast and shocking bacteriological weapons unit. They used batches of innocent Chinese and Soviet people for repeated criminal "research" and "experiments," resulting in the brutal massacre of over three thousand Chinese and Soviet people. The trial proved that on the battlefields of Central and Southern China, Japanese fascists spread various bacteria, causing countless Chinese peaceful people to die tragically. The trial proved that Japanese fascists established bases for the use of bacteriological weapons in the northeastern region of China bordering the Soviet Union,妄想 once they launched a war of aggression against the Soviet Union, they would use bacteriological weapons on a large scale to massacre peaceful Soviet people. After the liberation of the Northeast, plague spread for a long time in the vast northern regions, causing countless residents to die and inflicting great suffering and losses on the people of Northeast China. This was the crime left behind by Japanese fascists using Northeast China as an "experimental" area for bacteriological weapons. Fortunately, our democratic government, with the assistance of our ally, the Soviet Union, vigorously organized rescue efforts, which finally eradicated the plague. Now, our ally, the Soviet Union, is trying these manufacturers and users of inhumane bacteriological weapons, which is a manifestation of the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people, and a just act to safeguard the right to survival of the Chinese people.
    This trial is not only a deserved punishment for Japanese fascist war criminals, but also a powerful warning to the American and British warmongers who attempt to threaten peace in the Far East and the world with bacteriological weapons: the people of the world cannot forgive war criminals.

　　正义的审讯
    苏联国家检察机关对日本战犯田乙三、川岛清等十二人在日寇侵略中国战争中，曾制造和使用细菌武器的严重罪行提起控诉，并由滨海军区军事法庭开始审讯。这一审讯，乃是维护世界人类道德，维护远东与世界持久和平的正义举措，我们中国人民曾经经历了八年艰苦的抗日战争，对于伟大友邦苏联的这一正义举措，感到极大的兴奋，表示完全赞同与拥护，并要求严惩这些万恶不赦的法西斯战争罪犯。
    在第一天的审讯中，便充分暴露出日本法西斯的狰狞面目是何等的凶残，是何等疯狂与灭绝人性！审讯证明，日本法西斯在侵略我国战争中，曾组织了庞大惊人的细菌武器部队，用成批的中国和苏联无辜人民，进行多次罪恶“研究”和“实验”，因此而惨遭屠杀的中苏人民在三千以上。审讯证明，在华中华南的战场上，日本法西斯曾散布各种细菌，无数的中国和平人民因此而死于非命。审讯证明，日本法西斯曾在我东北毗连苏联的地区建立使用细菌武器的基地，曾妄想一旦发动侵苏战争，便大量使用细菌武器以屠杀苏联和平人民。而东北解放后，在北部广大地区中，鼠疫曾长期蔓延，无数居民因此死亡，使我东北人民遭受了莫大的痛苦与损失，这就是日本法西斯以东北为“实验”细菌武器地区而遗留的罪恶，幸赖我民主政府在友邦苏联援助下大力组织抢救，始将鼠疫扑灭。现在，友邦苏联审讯这些灭绝人性的细菌武器的制造者与使用者，正是苏联人民对我国人民深厚友谊的表现，是维护中国人民生存权利的正义行动。
    这一审讯，不仅是日本法西斯战争罪犯们应得的惩罚，而且也是对企图以细菌武器威胁远东与世界和平的美英战争贩子们一个有力的警告：世界人民对战争罪犯是不能饶恕的。
