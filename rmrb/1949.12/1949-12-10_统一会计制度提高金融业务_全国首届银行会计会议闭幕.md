　　Unified Accounting System Improves Financial Operations
　　National First Banking Accounting Conference Concludes
　　[This newspaper’s dispatch] The first National Banking Accounting Conference, hosted by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, was held in Beijing on November 10th and successfully concluded on December 2nd. The conference made important resolutions on unified accounting systems, unified fund allocation, the establishment of an economic accounting system, and audit work.
　　(1) Unifying the Accounting System by Integrating Conditions in Various Regions. Due to the different developments of the Liberation War, accounting systems in various liberated areas differed significantly. This conference, based on the experiences of various banks in ten years of rural work and three years of urban work, integrated the achievements of their accounting work and formulated a unified accounting system for the People's Bank of China under possible and necessary conditions. Unified regulations were made for all accounting work, including tables, reporting systems, calculation principles, specific procedures, and accounting subjects. (2) Unified Fund Allocation to Strengthen Business Ties. According to business development needs and the principle of centralized application, funds are uniformly allocated by the head office to enable more planned use of the entire fund. (3) Strict Economic Accounting and Unified Budget System. A budget system of periodic reporting and step-by-step review was established to strive for unified expenditure standards. (4) Establish Audit Work. Audit departments are established at all levels to promote economic inspection, eliminate waste, ensure that assets are not damaged, and strictly enforce economic discipline. (5) Overcome the purely technical view of accounting work and establish the principle of accounting serving policy. Accounting work should change accounting calculation principles and calculation methods with business development and needs.
　　These important resolutions will be implemented gradually from 1950. The concrete realization of these resolutions will take the national financial business a step forward.

　　统一会计制度提高金融业务
  　全国首届银行会计会议闭幕
    【本报讯】全国首届银行会计会议，在人民银行总行主持下于十一月十日在京举行，至本月二日圆满结束。会议中对统一会计制度，统一资金调拨，建立经济核算制度，以及稽核工作等均有重要决议。
    （一）综合各区情况统一会计制度。由于解放战争发展形势不同，各解放区银行会计制度多不一致，此次会议根据各行十年农村，三年城市的工作经验，综合其会计工作之成就，在可能与必须的条件下，拟定人民银行统一会计制度。举凡会计工作中之表帐、报告制度、计算原则、具体手续、会计科目等均作出统一规定。（二）统一资金调拨以加强业务联系。根据业务发展需要及集中运用之原则，资金统归总行调拨。以使整个资金运用能更有计划。（三）严格经济核算，统一预算制度。订立了按期报告，逐级审核之预算制度，争取开支标准统一。（四）建立稽核工作。各级行设立稽核部门，以推行经济检查。达到消灭浪费，保证资产不受破坏及严格执行经济纪律。（五）克服会计工作单纯技术观点，确立会计为政策服务之方针。会计工作应随业务发展与需要，变更会计计算原则及计算方法。
    这些重要的决议，将在一九五○年起次第实施。这些决议的具体实现，将使全国金融业务提高一步。
