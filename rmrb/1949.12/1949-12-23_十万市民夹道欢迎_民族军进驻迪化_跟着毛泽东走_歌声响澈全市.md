　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th. The people of all ethnic groups in Dihua City welcomed the entry of the National Army into the city with fervent enthusiasm. On the morning of December 6th, the news of the National Army entering the city spread throughout Dihua. Immediately, the large and small streets and lanes of the city were filled with solemn and brilliant five-star national flags. Although the city was filled with snow and cold air, the people of all minority ethnic groups, who had long been oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, had smiles on their faces that had never been seen before. Before ten o'clock, the streets and roads about four Chinese miles long west of the West Bridge were packed with people welcoming the National Army. The eyes of 100,000 people were all looking west, anticipating the arrival of the National Army. Chairman Bao Erhan and Vice-Chairman Saifuddin of the People's Provincial Government, Commander Wang Zhen of the People's Liberation Army, and others drove in trucks to greet them more than ten Chinese miles outside the city. At half past ten, more than forty green trucks of the National Army appeared on the street west of the West Bridge. Workers, students, merchants, and women welcoming them from both sides of the road rushed forward together and surrounded the first truck of the military band. The commanders and fighters of the National Army jumped out of the vehicles and, with huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu leading the way, marched forward in four columns. The strong and sturdy young soldiers, with "August 1st" five-star red hat badges shining on their hats and badges with the words "Chinese People's Liberation Army" written in both Han and Uyghur languages on their chests, carried rifles and machine guns, looking mighty and orderly. At the gate of the Xinjiang Daily, the National Army met with the People's Liberation Army stationed in Dihua. At this moment, cheers erupted from the welcoming crowd, they waved enthusiastically, and many people were moved to tears of excitement. When the soldiers of the National Army passed in front of the Xinjiang People's Provincial Government, citizens of all ethnic groups on the street applauded to welcome them. Many Uyghur people who could speak Chinese volunteered to be translators, loudly reading the red Uyghur slogans on the green trucks, such as "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party" and "Support Chairman Mao," and translating the song "Following Chairman Mao" that the National Army was singing. The Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups loved their national army even more. They crossed the welcoming ranks, riding rows of galloping horses to the very front of the welcomers. An elderly Uyghur man selling roast mutton outside the South Gate of Dihua City borrowed a horse from his neighbor and rushed to welcome them. He said, "I have lived for decades, and the Uyghurs of Dihua have never been so happy as they are today." They welcomed their own troops from the West Bridge, forgot the cold, and followed the troops for more than ten Chinese miles, out of the South Gate, and arrived at the South Liang reception center, only returning after watching the troops rest.

　　十万市民夹道欢迎
    民族军进驻迪化
    “跟着毛泽东走”歌声响澈全市
    【新华社西安十九日电】迪化市各族人民，以狂热心情欢迎民族军入城。十二月六日早晨，民族军入城的消息传遍了迪化市，全市大小街巷立即挂满了庄严灿烂的五星国旗。是日迪市虽雪花纷飞，冷气袭人，但久被国民党反动派压迫的各少数民族人民，脸上都堆满了从来未有的笑容。不到十时，西大桥以西约四华里长的街道和公路上，挤满了欢迎民族军的人群，十万人的眼睛都朝西面民族军的来路盼望着。人民省政府鲍尔汉主席、赛福鼎副主席、人民解放某兵团王震司令员等乘着卡车驶出离城十多华里的地方去迎接。十时半西大桥以西的街上，民族军的四十余辆绿色卡车出现了，夹道欢迎的工人、学生、商人、妇女一齐拥上，围住了军乐队的第一辆卡军。民族军的指战员，跳下车辆，以毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像为先导，四路纵队迈步行进。健壮结实的青年战士们，帽上闪耀着“八一”五星红帽花，胸前佩带着用汉维两族文字写成的“中国人民解放军”的徽章，荷着步枪和机关枪，威武整齐。在新疆日报社门口，民族军与进驻迪化的人民解放军会师了。这时夹道欢迎的人群中，发出欢呼，狂热地招手，不少人感动得流出了兴奋的热泪。当民族军的战士们走过新疆人民省政府门前时，街道上各族市民，都拍手欢迎。不少会说汉话的维族人民自动当翻译，大声念着绿色卡车上“中国共产党万岁”、“拥护毛主席”等红色维文标语，并翻译着民族军正唱着的“跟着毛泽东走”的歌曲。维吾尔、哈萨克等族人民，更是热爱自己的民族军队，他们越过欢迎行列，骑着一列一列的骏马，快马加鞭奔跃到欢迎者的最前面。迪化市南门外一位卖烤羊肉的维族老人，借邻居的乘马也赶上欢迎。他说：“我活了几十岁，迪化的维族人没有象今天这样高兴过。”他们从西大桥迎上自己的队伍，忘了寒冷，一直跟随着部队走了十多华里，出了南门，到达南梁招待处，看着部队休息时才回去。
