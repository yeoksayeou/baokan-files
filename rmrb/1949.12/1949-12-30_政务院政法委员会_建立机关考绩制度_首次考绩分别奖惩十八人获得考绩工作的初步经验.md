　　Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council
    Establishes Civil Service Performance Appraisal System
　  First Appraisal Awards and Punishes Eighteen Individuals, Gaining Preliminary Experience in Appraisal Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council, in order to effectively promote the work of the organs and improve administrative efficiency, previously decided to establish a performance appraisal system for its organs, strictly enforce rewards and punishments, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of its staff. The first performance appraisal work began to brew and discuss more than a month ago. After repeated research by the organization evaluation committee, it adopted the method of "administrative leadership combined with democratic evaluation" to check the work performance, ideological style, and work methods of all staff members. As a result of the assessment, the leadership decided to reward 17 staff members with excellent work performance. In addition to material rewards, four of them were promoted, and another four received salary increases or higher supply system benefits. In addition, He Guoliang, a driver who had two accidents and injured three people, was given a salary reduction.
    In order to summarize this performance appraisal work and reward outstanding staff, the committee convened a meeting of organ staff on the 21st to announce the list of award recipients and their deeds. Deputy Director Peng Zemin attended the meeting and personally presided over the award ceremony. Secretary-General Tao Xijin reported on the summary of the experience of this performance appraisal at the meeting. He pointed out four points: (1) Performance appraisal work should have a focus, which is to encourage the creativity of staff, so that everyone has a direction to work towards, and overcome some of the past bad phenomena; the standard of performance appraisal mainly depends on whether there is a contribution to the people. (2) The principle of the performance appraisal system is to have rewards and punishments, and to educate everyone; to focus on rewards and encourage progress. (3) Performance appraisal should be carried out by combining administrative leadership with democratic evaluation. (4) Performance appraisal should be a regular task.

    The seventeen staff members who received awards this time all had excellent achievements. For example, Wu Ying, the cadre who manages personnel files, is down-to-earth, careful, and studies her work. When the former North China People's Government ended, she not only rushed to sort out thousands of archives, but also established a system for future management of archives, demonstrating a selfless spirit in her work. Telephone operator Du Huiqing is proficient in her work and is known as the "telephone book." She connects lines accurately and quickly without any errors, and enthusiastically helps other comrades learn to answer the phone. Correspondent Zhang Bao delivers letters regardless of wind or rain, accurately and quickly, and learns to ride and repair bicycles, leading the entire team to repair bicycles themselves, saving public expenditure. Worker Wang Chouzi manages six rooms by himself, keeping them clean and tidy. Typist Teng Linge has trained three apprentices, learned to repair machines himself, which greatly facilitates work and saves expenses. When these people were gloriously awarded at the meeting, all the comrades applauded warmly.
    The award recipients took the stage one after another to speak, saying that this was just the beginning of serving the people wholeheartedly, and that they would work even harder in the future. Subsequently, comrades who did not receive awards spoke, feeling that working in the People's Government organs can give full play to everyone's creativity, and expressed that they will work hard to study their work and strive to receive awards.
    This performance appraisal work has been of great educational significance and has received good feedback. Because it was the first trial, the thinking was not very consistent at the beginning, the standards were not clear enough, and some units did not do it deeply and comprehensively. After the summary of this conference, it not only educated the cadres, but also provided preliminary experience for the performance appraisal work of various ministries and commissions.

　　政务院政法委员会
    建立机关考绩制度
　  首次考绩分别奖惩十八人获得考绩工作的初步经验
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会为有效地推动机关工作，提高行政效率，前曾决定建立本机关的考绩制度，严明奖惩，以发挥工作人员的积极性与创造性。首次考绩工作于月余前开始酝酿讨论，经组织评议委员会反复研究，通过“行政领导结合民主评议”的方式，检查了全体工作人员的工作成绩以及思想作风、工作方式等。考绩的结果，对工作成绩优良的十七位工作人员，领导上决定予以奖励，除予以物质奖励外，其中四人并提升职务，另四人增加薪金或提高供给制待遇。此外，又对驾车出过两次事故，碰伤三人的司机何国良，予以减薪处分。
    为了总结此次考绩工作并奖励优良工作人员，该会于二十一日召开了机关工作人员大会，宣布了受奖人员的名单及其事迹，彭泽民副主任到会亲自主持发奖。陶希晋秘书长在会上报告了此次考绩经验总结，他指出四点：（一）考绩工作应有重点，在于鼓励工作人员的创造性，使大家有努力的方向，克服过去的一些不良现象；考绩的标准，主要看对人民有无贡献。（二）考绩制度的原则是有奖有罚，教育大家；以奖为主，鼓励前进。（三）考绩应以行政领导结合民主评议来进行。（四）考绩应是经常性的工作。（报告全文见另条）
    此次受奖的十七位工作人员，均有其优良成绩。如管理人事档案的干部吴颖，踏实细心，钻研业务，在前华北人民政府结束时，不仅把上千件的档案材料突击整理出来，而且为今后管理档案工作订立了制度办法，在工作中表现了忘我的精神。电话员杜慧卿，精通业务，人称“电话簿”，接线准确迅速，从无差错，并热心帮助其他同志学会接电话。通讯员张保送信风雨无阻，准确迅速，并学会骑车、修车，带动全班自己修车，节省公家开支。工务员王丑子，一人管六个屋子，保持整洁。打字员滕麟阁带出三个徒弟，学会自己修理机器，给工作上以很大方便，并节省开支。当这些人在大会上光荣受奖时，全场同志报以热烈的掌声。
    会上受奖人纷纷登台讲话，表示这还只是全心全意为人民服务的开始，今后还要更加努力。续有未受奖同志发言，感到在人民政府机关中工作，能够发挥每个人的创造性，表示今后要努力钻研业务，争取受奖。
    此次考绩工作教育意义很大，反映良好。因系初次试行，在最初开始酝酿进行时，思想不甚一致，标准不够明确，有些单位做得不够深入全面，经过这次大会的总结，不仅教育了干部，而且为各部会的考绩工作提供了初步经验。
