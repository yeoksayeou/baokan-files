Under the Support of US-Dutch Imperialism
    A New Puppet Government is Formed in Indonesia
    Sukarno's Speech Proves the Puppet Nature of the "United States of Indonesia"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22nd] The new puppet government of the "United States of Indonesia," headed by Sukarno and Hatta and supported by US-Dutch imperialism, has been formed. According to Agence France-Presse: On December 16th, the electoral college composed of representatives from the sixteen member states of the "United States of Indonesia" elected Sukarno as the first "President" of the "United States of Indonesia." Sukarno was sworn in on the 17th in Yogyakarta, and on the 18th appointed Hatta as the "Prime Minister" of the "United States of Indonesia," authorizing him, together with the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Buwono, the Prime Minister of the puppet state of East Indonesia, Anak Agung, and the Sultan of Pontianak, Hamid II, to be responsible for organizing the first cabinet of the "United States of Indonesia." Hatta formed his puppet cabinet on the 20th. In this new cabinet, members of the Sukarno-Hatta group, representing the Indonesian feudal landlords and bourgeois reactionaries, still occupy key positions. Among the ten so-called "Republic" representatives and six "Federalist" representatives, Hatta, in addition to serving as Foreign Minister himself, has his two closest collaborators—the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Buwono, and the Prime Minister of East Indonesia, Anak Agung—appointed as Minister of Defense and Minister of Interior respectively. According to Reuters, other cabinet members are: Finance Minister Sjafruddin (former head of the Republic's emergency cabinet in Sumatra), Minister of Economic Affairs Juanda, Minister of Health Lim, Minister of Transportation and Public Works Lausu, Minister of Labor Wilopo, Minister of Public Welfare and Social Affairs Asaas, Minister of Information Mononutu, Minister of Education Fashi, Minister of Religious Affairs Haisingmu, Minister of Justice Supomo, Minister without Portfolio Sultan Hamid, Rum and Subamo.
    Hatta, after the formation of his new puppet government, declared that he is scheduled to fly to the Netherlands on the 23rd in order to receive the so-called "sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia" from the Dutch government on the 27th, with the Queen of the Netherlands as its head of state. The puppet nature of this "United States of Indonesia" has been further confirmed by Sukarno's recent speech. Sukarno declared on the 15th that the Dutch colonial army in Indonesia will become part of the armed forces of the "United States of Indonesia." Sukarno further assured the Dutch, Europeans, and Indonesians who had served in the Dutch administrative agencies and army in Indonesia of their safety, saying: "The personnel in the Dutch-Indonesian army, no matter where they come from, their interests and their families will be taken care of in the same way."

　　美荷帝国主义扶植下
    印尼新傀儡政府组成
    苏加诺演说中证明了“印尼合众国”的傀儡性质
    【新华社北京二十二日电】美荷帝国主义扶植的以苏加诺、哈达为首的“印尼合众国”新傀儡政府，已经组成。据法新社称：十二月十六日，由“印尼合众国”十六个成员国的代表所组成的选举团，已推选苏加诺为“印尼合众国”首任“总统”。苏加诺已于十七日在日惹宣誓就职，并于十八日任命哈达为“印尼合众国总理”，授命他和日惹苏丹波乌诺、东印尼傀儡邦总理阿纳克·阿贡及坤甸苏丹哈米德二世负责组织“印尼合众国”首届内阁。哈达已于二十日组成其傀儡内阁。在这一新阁中，代表印尼封建地主及资产阶级反动派的苏加诺、哈达集团分子，仍然占据主要职位。在包括十位所谓“共和国”代表及六位“联邦派”代表中，哈达除自兼外长外，与他最接近的两个合作者——日惹苏丹波乌诺与东印尼总理阿纳克·阿贡，分任国防部长与内政部长两要职。据路透社消息，其他阁员人选为：财长斯查佛鲁丁（前在苏门答腊的共和国紧急内阁首脑），经济部长朱安达，卫生部长里姆，交通及公共工程部长劳斯，劳工部长维洛坡，公共福利及社会事务部长阿萨斯，宣传部长莫诺努吐，教育部长法氏，宗教部长海斯丁姆，司法部长苏波莫，不管部长苏丹哈米德，鲁姆及苏巴莫。
    哈达在其新傀儡政府组成后宣称，他定于二十三日乘机赴荷兰，以便于二十七日自荷兰政府手中接收以荷兰女王为元首的所谓“印尼合众国主权”。这个“印尼合众国”的傀儡性质，已由苏加诺最近的演说，得到新的证明。苏加诺于十五日宣称：荷兰在印尼的殖民军队，将成为“印尼合众国”武装部队的一部分。苏加诺更向在印尼的荷兰人、欧洲人及曾在荷兰行政机构和军队中服务的印尼人，保证他们的安全，并说：“荷印军中的人员，不论来自何处，他们的利益及其家庭，都将一样地受到照顾。”
