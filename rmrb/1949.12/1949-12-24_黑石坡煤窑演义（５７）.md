　　The Ballad of Black Stone Slope Coal Mine (57)

  　　　　　Fifty-Three: Twists and Turns
    During the Lantern Festival, Da San kept going to the mine to inspect, and he had several discussions with Lao Yin, Shuan Cheng, Tian Lu, and Xi Lu. He also held a meeting of shareholder representatives. On the early morning of the seventeenth, he held another shareholders' meeting, where he reported the plan for the upcoming action.
    Originally, Da San had planned to install the seventh spiral ladder and then start draining water while installing ventilation ducts. But now he changed his earlier plan, saying that the ventilation ducts couldn't be installed yet, and they still had to drain water to find a good location. By this time, most of the millet at the mine had been used up, and people couldn't help but feel anxious, but for a moment, no one had anything to say. Later, Shuan Cheng saw that Tai Cheng was whispering something to the people next to him, so he asked him to speak up. He said, "I'll speak up since no one else is saying anything. I'm not trying to argue with our Uncle Da San. What I'm saying is, based on what we can see with our own eyes, it can be ventilated! The west mine can connect to Yu Bao's old ventilation duct, and the east mine can ventilate northwest from the west fork between the fifth and sixth spiral ladders. Maybe it will work! But I don't know for sure!" Xiao Yang Gui asked, "How confident are you?" Tai Cheng said, "If I were confident, wouldn't I be the boss? We're having a meeting to be democratic!" At this point, Da San got angry again, but Shuan Cheng knew that this meeting wouldn't be easy, and he was afraid that Da San would get angry, so he had told Tian Lu to take good care of him beforehand. Therefore, Tian Lu quickly stopped him. He sulked for a while, and took a few deep breaths. Seeing that people had stopped arguing but were all looking at him, he said, "I'm afraid there's water in the route that Tai Cheng mentioned. Besides, if we dig northwest from that fork, I'm afraid the direction to connect to the old ventilation duct won't be right either!" Tai Cheng blushed and didn't say anything. Then Tian Lu said that he agreed with his third brother's plan, but it wasn't because they were brothers trying to be polite. Yu Bao also asked to speak, saying that he didn't think ventilation would be guaranteed at this time, and he gave many reasons. But there were many people with many ideas at the meeting, and in the end, no one had a clear idea, and everyone was just afraid that there wouldn't be enough millet. Lao Yin suggested that everyone go to the bottom of the mine to take a look, and people went in a rush.
    People looked all over the inside and outside of the mine, and listened to Da San's explanations. In the end, they decided to follow Da San's plan. At that time, someone suggested starting to mine coal in the east mine as well, but Da San said that the coal in front of the mine entrance was shallow, not profitable, and not good for the mine, so it wasn't approved. Lin Bao was still shouting that he was afraid there wouldn't be enough millet, and Xi Lu repeatedly told everyone to remember the cost of supplies. Lao Yin had to tell everyone that Lao Bai had sent a letter; the district's production grain loan was coming down, and there would be a solution soon, which relieved people's minds. That night, they continued to drain water and mine coal as usual.
    However, afterwards, people's enthusiasm didn't seem as great as before. Several shareholders didn't come to work, and some tentatively wanted to withdraw their shares. Lao Yin and Shuan Cheng were busy matching land, which was a huge hassle for them. Da San showed his attitude several times at the mine, but it didn't help. Fortunately, Lin Bao, Xi Lu, Xiao Yang Gui, and the Liu Gou family often persuaded Da San, and Tian Lu put in even more effort, constantly preventing his third brother from getting angry, and not letting his third brother criticize those who didn't come to work. He would rather go to people's homes himself to ask them to come. If they weren't there, he would run around to find them, or he would squat in their homes silently until they came back, and then say, "It's our own mine, go!" No matter how people acted mischievously or gossiped, he never got angry, and kept pulling people to come, and that's how they managed to get by day by day. Except for those who were sick, visiting relatives, or had something to do, there was no one who deliberately didn't come. But at this time, there were more workers at the mine than before, and even if they had the right people, they couldn't always keep up. Tian Lu personally went down to drain water. Once, he worked three shifts in two days. After getting off work, he was busy taking care of things up and down. Even Xiao Yang Gui handed over the errands to an old man and wore a pair of pants with holes in them to work as a water drainer. The Liu Gou family asked him, "What about your new clothes from the Lantern Festival? Are you really shameless and don't care? Aren't you afraid of me seeing you like that..." Xiao Yang Gui quickly threatened, "People are so busy that they don't even have time to pee, and you're still joking! My wife has to be willing to let me wear new clothes!" The Liu Gou family became more reserved and proper after that.
    Almost half a month passed, and the water was indeed getting less and less. But these days, Da San hadn't been seen managing things much. Tian Lu was busy with everything. Tian Lu only knew how to say nice things and do things, but he didn't know how to call meetings. The other cadres were entangled in dividing the land, and they couldn't even hold a meeting of shareholder representatives! Who broke a water bucket and didn't report it; there was less coal coming out of the west mine again; even though the people at the counter wanted to weigh the grain higher, there was more loss; there were only a few days left of millet... And Tian Lu was only draining water at the first spiral ladder, and he didn't easily rest when he started, often draining for a while and then there wasn't much water left, so he had to yell for the people below to drain faster; this caused a lot of complaints from the water drainers. Tai Cheng and Niu Bao started secretly gossiping again. These words seemed serious but also like jokes, making people unable to figure them out... It was unknown when this mine would ever succeed!
    　　　　Fifty-Four: A Solution
    At this time, Da San had an even better plan for the mine. For many days, he hadn't been managing the urgent affairs of the mine, but he was holding his inseparable compass, relying on what he had seen inside and outside the mine for many years with his own eyes. He was determined to inspect the area around the mining area, wishing he could see a ventilation duct that had already been opened with just one glance. By the beginning of February, when the eleventh spiral ladder was installed at the bottom of the mine, he had finally found a good location to simultaneously ventilate the east and west mines. Coincidentally, the village's land distribution had eased up a bit, and the cadres and shareholder representatives jointly studied Da San's plan. At that time, Tai Cheng said, "I'm afraid the path will be a bit far if we ventilate this way!" Tian Lu said, "Maybe we'll encounter 'Seven'." Da San said, "It is far, but it's safe. I'm afraid there might be a 'Seven'." Everyone agreed to follow Da San's plan. The next day, a shareholders' meeting was held. It turned out that Da San's plan had spread overnight, and everyone knew about it. After a lot of arguing at the meeting, it was passed. Then everyone conducted a self-criticism.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５７）
    康濯
  　　　　　五十三　波折
    闹元宵的时候，大三还不断去窑上察看，并跟老尹拴成天禄喜禄捣拉过几回，还开了一次股东代表会；十七大早，又开股东大会，他便报告了往后动弹的计划。
    原来大三是盘算着按上七道旋以后，一边打水一边透风筒的；但现在他却改了早先的底底，他说风筒还不能透，还得往下打水找地势。这时窑上小米花了一大半，人们不免心慌，可一时又都没话说。后来拴成见泰成老跟旁边的人悄悄嘀咕什么，就叫他说；他道：“没人说我就说说。我这话虽说没在股东代表会上表明出来，可也不是跟咱大三叔闹蹩扭。我说嘛，凭咱这不顶的肉眼看，能透！西窑就就上玉宝那旧风筒道，东窑从五六道旋当间西岔道往西北透，许也能通；可不知行不！”小洋鬼问道：“你能拿住几成底底？”泰成说：“我能拿住底底，那我又不当领事？咱这是开会民主嘛！”大三这时又动了气，但拴成知道今个这会不容易开，怕他生气，事先就叫天禄好好照顾上他的，因此天禄忙劝住了他。他别了一阵，俩鼻孔直呼呼出了出大气，只见人们不咯吵了，却都朝他看，他便说：“泰成说的道怕有水；再说，从那条岔道往西北刨，还怕连通旧风筒的方向也不对哩！”泰成红了脸，不啃气了，这边天禄便说：他同意他老三的谱谱，可他这不是弟兄们要情面；玉宝也要求发言，说他看着这会透也不保险，并说了很多道理。但会上人多主意多，说到根底可又没个准主意，只是都怕小米不够。老尹提义让大伙都去窑底看看，人们就哄走了。
    人们窑里窑外看了个遍，并听大三说了各种道理，最后总算决定了照大三的办。当时又有人提出东窑也开始刨炭，但大三说窑口前边炭浅，没利，对窑也不好，便没通过；林宝还嚷着怕米不够，喜禄也再三叫大伙结记着垫本的事，老尹只得告大家，说老白来了信；分区生产贷粮下来了，快有办法，人们才松了心。黑夜，就又照样打水刨炭。
    不过往后人们的劲头看着不如过去大，还有几个股东不来上工，并有试探着想退股的；老尹拴成扁小又在忙着配搭土地，光那就麻烦死了他们，大三在窑上是很动了几回态度，可也不顶。亏得林宝喜禄小洋鬼柳沟家短不了打劝大三，天禄更使出劲来，整天压住不让他老三生气，并不让他老三批评那些不来上工的，他宁愿自己上门叫人，人不在他就跑腿找，要不就圪＠在人家家里，不声不响地直等到人家回来，便说：“咱自己的窑嘛，去吧！”人们怎么跳皮耍猾说闲话，他总是不动火，一个劲拉人家去，这才一天天凑合下来，除了闹病、走亲、有事的，倒没什么故意不来的了。但这时窑上用工比过去多，碰对了人手还会赶接不上，天禄便亲自下手打水，有一回他还两天打三班，下了工再忙着上下照管；连小洋鬼也把打点的事交给了个老汉，穿条露肉裤子当水工，柳沟家问他：“你过元宵那新衣裳呢？你真豁着脸不要，不怕我见了你那……”小洋鬼忙吓唬道：“人家一天急得尿尿也没工夫的，你他妈还是个耍笑！新衣裳也得我老婆肯给我穿呀！”柳沟家扭扭地，自后也装得古板正经了些。
    这么又快半月，水算是的确不多了。但这些天却不怎么见大三管事，一切尽是天禄忙；天禄只会给人说句把好话办事，不知道召集会，别的干部又在纠缠着分地，连个股东代表会也开不成！窑上谁打坏了壳篓不交代啦；西窑出炭又少了啦；柜上人们取粮食尽管要秤高些，可失落就多了啦；小米也用不了几天啦……还有天禄打水光打头道旋，他动弹开又轻易不歇，常是打一阵就水不多了，得吆喝下边紧打；这也闹得水工们尽是意见。泰成牛宝们可又悄悄说开了跳皮话，这些话说是正经可又象是耍笑，闹得人们捉摸不住……这窑真不知何年何月才能闹成！
    　　　　五十四　办法
    却说这时大三对窑倒更有了谱谱。多日来他没怎么管窑上当紧的杂事，却拿着他那个不离身的定南针，仗凭他的肉眼在大窑里外多年见到的，他别着一股劲，在矿区四外察看，恨不得一眼就看出一道已经透开了的风筒；到二月初，窑底安上十一道旋的时候，他总算看好了从东西窑同时透风筒的地势。恰好这阵子村里分地的事也松了些，干部们就和股东代表共同研究了大三的计划，当时泰成说：“这么透就怕道远些！”天禄说：“还许会碰到‘七’。”大三道：“远倒是远，可是保险。‘七’怕不准有。”大家就都同意了照大三合计的办。第二天，召开股东大会，原来一夜工夫，大三的计划就传开了，说也知道了，会上好赖咯嚷了一阵，也通过了，下边大家就进行检讨。
