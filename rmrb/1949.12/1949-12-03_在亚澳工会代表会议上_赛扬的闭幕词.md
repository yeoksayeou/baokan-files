　　Sillant's Closing Speech at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference

　　The following is the full text of the closing speech by Sillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference:

　　Dear Comrades:

　　The work of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference has now concluded. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions has entrusted me with making a preliminary conclusion and bringing these works to a close.

　　This Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference lasted from November 16th to December 1st, 1949. The work of the conference was carried out in plenary sessions, the Resolutions Committee, and the Drafting Committee. This significant task has been completed over these fifteen days. If we pose the question: has this Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference accomplished its mission? Our answer is a definite yes! How was this task accomplished? I will now briefly explain the work of this conference as follows:

　　(1) After conducting a review, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference expressed satisfaction with all international trade union organizational activities related to Asian and Far Eastern countries by the World Federation of Trade Unions in the past.

　　(2) The reports presented to the conference by all national delegations provided rich materials on the political, economic, and social environments in which the working class of each Asian country finds itself. These reports also deeply analyzed the past experiences and ongoing work of the working class and their trade union movements in each Asian country. These reports demonstrate the true strength of the workers' movement in these countries.

　　(3) The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference reaffirmed its close connection with the World Federation of Trade Unions. The national trade unions you represent endorse the proposal of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions to establish an Asian Liaison Bureau. This liaison bureau has been organized. Regarding its internal organization and its work, it will commence immediately.

　　(4) We have identified the important tasks for the future actions of the trade union movement in each country. Therefore, we unanimously passed the following resolutions:

　　——A call to the workers of the capitalist countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.

　　——A concise program based on the reports of national representatives.

　　——A declaration to the working men and women of Asian countries. This declaration is an important document that defines the future policy direction of workers and trade unions in Asian countries.

　　From the above four tasks I have just mentioned, it can be seen that this Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference has fulfilled its responsibility. That is, the conference conveyed the will that millions of working men and women wanted to express.

　　Such a conference is the first of its kind in the history of our international workers' movement. It demonstrates that the development of our strength has enabled the workers' movement in Asian countries to reach a stage of political maturity. We certainly cannot consider that trade union actions in Asian countries are still in their initial stages, but neither can we say that there has been a long period of experience or a trade union tradition in these countries. Therefore, we can definitely say that this Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference is a starting point for a new stage. This new stage is manifested in the entire workers' movement under the leadership of trade unions, taking consistent action in different but related ways. This is the first practical and concrete achievement of this conference.

　　What are the lessons we can immediately learn from this conference? The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions have gained broader and deeper experience in the course of this Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference. The study of everything that has been said and done here is very beneficial to us. Now I think I can point out some of the more prominent and important lessons:

　　(1) The World Federation of Trade Unions and all national trade union organizations should not underestimate the importance of the historic victory of the Chinese people in overthrowing domestic and foreign oppressors. We should give a correct assessment of the fundamental role played by the Chinese working class in the establishment of the People's Republic of China. We all know that even the enemies of the working class and their reactionary groups also know the leading, that is, decisive, role played by the Chinese Communist Party in this great victory. If viewed purely from the perspective of trade unions, this victory in China can also be well explained by the rapid development of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The workers of the whole world should understand this.

　　(2) Due to the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference, we understand that the development of the trade union movement in Asian countries will differ from each other in the future:

　　In China, Mongolia, and northern Korea, trade union organizations will assume important economic and social responsibilities in their respective countries and can actively and highly develop. Due to the people's democratic dictatorship, this development is carried out under the control and leadership of the working class.

　　In Vietnam, southern Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaya, trade unions have the opportunity to expand their influence among the working masses and the people. They can intensify the struggle for national liberation and carry out anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggles.

　　In India, Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, Iran, and Japan, democratic trade unions will encounter more brutal persecution of their leaders and fighters. Under these circumstances, in order to strengthen their struggle, they should find effective ways to maintain contact with the working masses.

　　(3) The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference should have a correct understanding of the urgent need that the world workers' movement must fight against imperialism and colonial policies, and at the same time, fight against those reactionary bourgeois elements in Asian countries who collude with imperialism.

　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference clearly revealed that working men and women in oppressed Asian countries live in impoverished conditions, under slave-like working conditions, and deprived of all aspects of life. This tragic picture fully illustrates the inhumane social environment under imperialist rule, which harms the living habits of the entire people and allows capitalists to exploit profits in those countries.

　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference pointed out that the actions of those reformist and reactionary trade unions cannot liberate the oppressed working men and women of Asia from their subordinate and dependent status. We know that trade union actions are closely related to the struggle for national liberation and independence. In certain circumstances, compromise and reform may be useful, but such reform can only be regarded as a by-product of the working class struggle transitioning to a violent stage.

　　Only the victory of the struggle for national independence and liberation can drastically transform the social conditions of workers in Asian countries; only by expelling imperialism from the land of Asia and eliminating its power, methods, and means is there a possibility of such a drastic transformation of social conditions.

　　Reactionaries and colonialists dissolved trade union organizations in some Asian countries, thinking that this would stop the united action of the working class. Their judgment was wrong. This act can never stop the unity of the workers. Their declaration that all democratic groups and trade union organizations are illegal inevitably forces the actions of the working class to go underground, and their actions must be led by the vanguard of the working class, which is closely connected with the working masses.

　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference pointed out that the working class does have enemies, namely feudal elements, reactionary bourgeois elements, and those who profit from the fascist system under the protection of American, British, French, and Dutch imperialism. But the working class also has its allies: the peasants, intellectuals, and progressive elements among the people. Therefore, the working class and trade unions are not isolated. We will never allow the conspiracy to isolate the working class to succeed.

　　Our workers' movement and trade unions should have the ability to face their arduous tasks. In some respects, these tasks are truly heroic struggles.

　　In the oppressed countries, workers should know what a true trade union movement should be like. A completely free national trade union movement and the existence of imperialists are incompatible, because these countries themselves are not free. Therefore, all trade union organizations in oppressed countries can only achieve true democracy if they are loyal to the spirit of proletarian internationalism and formally join the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The leaders of the British Trade Union Congress, the American Federation of Labor, and the American CIO splitters are attempting to create a so-called Asian Labor Federation to divide the Asian workers' movement. Through this counterfeit so-called labor federation, they are attempting to infiltrate and control trade unions, just as imperialism rules those countries. From this attempt, as from the fact that the leaders of the Anglo-American splitters are now launching a so-called new international trade union alliance in London, it can be clearly seen that these reactionary trade union leaders are the main social supporters of their own national bourgeoisie and world imperialism.

　　The narrow patriotism of these splitters is just another manifestation of imperialism in society, and the American and British working class splitters are engaged in activities in this regard. In this way, they demonstrate their ideological decay.

　　(4) This Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference has once again educated us that there is a common interest between the working classes of all countries. This very obvious common interest exists between the working classes of economically more advanced countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands (whose governments are pursuing imperialist policies in Asia) and the working classes of Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries (who play a decisive role in the national liberation movement). The working class in imperialist countries and the working class in oppressed countries form a united front for struggle. Therefore, every victory of imperialism inevitably leads to the rampant reactionary policies of its own country. At the same time, every victory of the working class in capitalist countries, even if it is partial, can weaken the power of the colonialists.

　　Due to the existence of a united front of the working class in the world, the final victory of the anti-imperialist struggle will be realized. The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference affirmed the necessity of this united front, contributed to the consolidation of this front, and will make this front more effective in the future.

　　Dear Comrades: The above four points are the main and significant gains of our conference. These gains have enriched the experience of our international trade union movement and greatly promoted the consolidation of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　We leave Beijing and China with joy. Because we have made our efforts here for the cause of peace among nations, socialism, and the working class, which has an important mission in human history.

　　We will continue to fight. After this Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference held in Beijing, we will go forward with greater confidence towards the victory of the anti-oppression struggle of the oppressed nations.

　　Long live the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference!

　　Long live the struggle for the liberation of all nations! Down with imperialism!

　　Long live the action and solidarity of the working class of the whole world! Down with the splitters!

　　Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, the great organization for national liberation and social liberation of the international working class!

### 在亚澳工会代表会议上　赛扬的闭幕词

　　在亚澳工会代表会议上
    赛扬的闭幕词
    【新华社北京二日电】世界工联总书记赛扬在亚澳工会代表会议上的闭幕词全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    亚澳工会代表会议的工作现在已经结束了。世界工联执行局委托我把这些工作作一个初步的结论，并将这些工作做一个结束。
    这次亚洲澳洲工会代表会议从一九四九年十一月十六日起到十二月一日止。会议的工作分别在全体会议、决议委员会、起草委员会进行，在这十五天过程中把这一件重大的工作完成了。假使我们提出这样一个问题：这次亚澳工会代表会议有没有完成他的任务呢？我们的回答是肯定的！如何完成了这个任务的呢，我现在把这次大会的工作简略说明如下：
    （一）在进行审查之后，亚澳工会代表会议对于过去世界工联有关亚洲及远东各国的一切国际性的工会组织活动表示满意。
    （二）所有各国代表团向大会做的报告都提供了亚洲每个国家工人阶级所处的政治、经济、社会环境的丰富材料。这些报告也深刻地分析了亚洲每一个国家的工人阶级及他们工会运动的过去以及现在正在进行中的工作经验。根据这些报告可以看出这些国家工人运动的真实力量。
    （三）亚澳工会代表会议重申与世界工联紧密联系。你们所代表的各国工会赞同世界工联执行局的提议设立亚洲联络局。这个联络局已经组织起来。关于内部机构以及它的工作，立刻就要开始。
    （四）我们已经把每个国家的工会运动未来行动的重要任务指出，因此，我们一致通过下面的决定：
    ——一个向资本主义国家美、英、法、荷工人的号召。
    ——一个根据各国代表的报告制成的我们的简明纲领。
    ——一个告亚洲各国男女工人的宣言。这个宣言是确定亚洲各国工人及工会的未来政策的动向的重要文件。
    从我刚才所说的上四个任务可以看出，此次亚澳工会代表会议已经完成了他的责任，这就是大会传达了数百万男女工人所要表示的意志。
    这样的会议在我们国际工人运动史上还是第一次。它表现我们力量的发展已使亚洲各国工人运动达到政治上成熟的阶段。我们自然不能认为亚洲各国工会行动尚在开始阶段，但亦不能说在这些国家已有一个长时期的经验或者工会传统。因此，我们可以肯定地说，这次亚澳工会代表会议是一个新阶段的出发点。这个新的阶段表现着在工会领导下的整个工人运动，以不同方式但有联系地采取着一致行动。这就是这次会议的第一个实际而且具体的收获。
    什么是我们从这次会议里立刻可以得到的经验教训呢？世界工联的执行局与世界工联的执行委员会在此次亚澳工会代表会议工作进行中更广泛地，而且更深入地得到了丰富的经验教训。对于在这里一切所说的话和一切所做的事的研究，是对我们非常有益的。现在我想我可以把其中比较显著的重要的教训指出几点：
    （一）世界工联以及所有各国工会组织不应低估中国人民打倒国内外压迫者所获得的历史性的胜利的重要性。我们应对中国工人阶级在建立中华人民共和国中所起的基本作用，给它一个正确的估量。我们大家都晓得，连那些工人阶级的敌人和他们的反动集团也知道，中国共产党在这次伟大的胜利中所起的领导的、也就是决定性的作用。假如完全从工会的观点来看，这次中国的胜利也可以从中华全国总工会的飞跃发展上得到一个很好的解释。关于这一点，全世界工人都应该了解。
    （二）由于亚澳工会代表会议，使我们明了今后亚洲各国工会运动的发展彼此之间将会有一些不同：
    在中国、蒙古和朝鲜北部的工会组织将在各该国负起经济、社会上的重任，可以积极地高度地发展，由于人民民主专政，使得这种发展在工人阶级的掌握和领导下进行。
    在越南、朝鲜南部、印度尼西亚、泰国、菲律宾、马来亚各国的工会已有可能扩大他们在工人群众、在人民中的影响，他们可以加紧民族解放的斗争，进行反殖民政策及反帝斗争。
    在印度、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦、伊朗以及日本各国的民主工会将会遭遇到对他们的领导者以及战士的更残酷的迫害。他们在这种情况之下，为加强他们的斗争，应该找到有效方法去和工人大众保持联系。
    （三）亚澳工会代表会议应该对于迫切的需要具有一个正确的理解，即世界工人运动必须和帝国主义以及殖民政策作斗争，同时，要向亚洲各国国内的那些跟帝国主义勾结的资产阶级反动分子作斗争。
    亚澳工会代表会议明显地揭露了亚洲各被压迫国家内的男女工人在穷困的环境中，在奴隶式的工作条件之下，在被剥夺了一切的生活状态中。这一幅悲惨的图画充分地说明了帝国主义统治下的不人道的社会环境，危害了整个人民的生活习惯，让资本家在那些国家去搜刮利润。
    亚澳工会代表会议指出，那些改良主义的反动工会的行动不可能使得亚洲被压迫的男女工人从附庸和依赖的地位中解脱出来，我们知道：工会的行动是与民族解放和独立斗争有密切联系的，在某些环境之下，妥协和改良也许是有用的，但是这种改良只能看做是工人阶级斗争转变到剧烈阶段的过程中的副产品。
    只有民族独立和解放的斗争获得胜利，才能够使亚洲各国工人的社会条件得到剧烈的转变；只有把亚洲土地上的帝国主义驱逐出去，消灭他的力量、方法和手段，才有这种社会条件的剧烈转变的可能性。
    反动分子以及殖民者解散了亚洲某些国家的工会组织，以为这样就可以停止工人阶级的联合一致的行动，他们的判断是错误了。这种行为决不能停止工人的团结。他们宣布一切民主团体及工会组织非法，必然地迫使工人阶级的行动转入地下，而他们的行动必须由跟劳动大众密切联系着的工人阶级的先锋队所领导。
    亚澳工会代表会议指出：工人阶级固然有敌人，那就是封建分子、资产阶级的反动分子以及在美、英、法、荷帝国主义庇护下，借着法西斯制度获利的人们。但是工人阶级亦有他的同盟者：那就是农民、知识分子以及人民中的进步分子。因此工人阶级以及工会并不是孤立的。我们决不允许孤立工人阶级的阴谋获得成功。
    我们工人运动及工会应该有面对他们的艰巨的任务的能力。从若干方面看来，这些任务就是真正的英勇斗争。
    在被压迫的国家中，工人应该知道真正的工会运动应该是怎样的。一个完全自由的全国工会运动和帝国主义者的存在是不两立的，因为这些国家本身就是不自由的。因此，所有被压迫国家的工会组织，惟有能忠实于无产阶级的国际主义精神，正式加入世界工联，才能达到真正的民主。
    英国工会大会、美国劳联，以及美国产联分裂分子的领袖们，企图制造一个所谓亚洲劳工联合会来分化亚洲工人运动。用这种冒牌的所谓劳工联合会，他们企图渗入工会内部加以控制，犹如帝国主义统治那些国家一般。从这种企图，正如从英美分裂分子的领袖们现在正在伦敦发动召开一个所谓新的国际工会联盟一样，可以很明显地看出这些反动工会领导人就是他们本国资产阶级以及全世界帝国主义的主要的社会的支持者。
    这些分裂分子的狭隘爱国主义只是帝国主义在社会方面的另一种表现，而美英工人阶级分裂分子正是在这方面进行活动的。由此他们表现了他们思想上的腐朽。
    （四）这次亚澳工会代表会议再一次教育了我们：在各国工人阶级之间存在着一个共同的利益，这种很显明的共同利益，是存在于在经济上比较前进的如美、英、法、荷各国的工人阶级（他们的政府却在亚洲执行帝国主义政策），和亚洲殖民地和半殖民地国家的工人阶级之间（但他们在和民族解放运动中起了决定性作用）。帝国主义国家里的工人阶级和被压迫国家里的工人阶级形成一个统一的斗争阵线，因此，每次帝国主义的胜利必然地造成他本国反动政策的猖獗。同时资本主义国家工人阶级每一次的胜利，即使是局部的，亦可以使殖民者的力量削弱。
    由于世界各国工人阶级统一阵线的存在，反帝国主义斗争的最后胜利必将实现。亚澳工会代表会议肯定了这一个统一阵线的必要性，对于巩固这个阵线做了贡献，并在将来使这个阵线更加有效。
    亲爱的同志们：以上四点就是我们这次会议主要的重大收获。这些收获使我们国际工会运动的经验更加丰富，并且大大地促进了世界工联的巩固。
    我们带着愉快的心情，离开北京和中国。因为我们在这里对于各民族间的和平、社会主义以及在人类历史上负有重要使命的工人阶级的事业，尽了我们的努力。
    我们还要继续进行斗争。在这次北京召开的亚澳工会代表会议之后，我们将以更大的信心，走向被压迫民族的反压迫斗争的胜利。
    亚澳工会代表会议万岁！
    各民族解放斗争万岁！打倒帝国主义！
    全世界工人阶级行动和团结万岁！打倒分裂分子！
    国际工人阶级的民族解放和社会解放的伟大组织，世界工联万岁！
