　　▲Fifty-four students and five doctors from the Nanjing University Medical School formed the "Nanjing University Medical School Staff and Student Hygiene Service Team" and went to rural areas in the suburbs of Nanjing to set up medical stations for treatment work. From October 17th to the 27th of last month, they treated more than 150 patients, two of whom underwent surgical treatment. Only the cost of the medicine was charged for the treatment, and other expenses were donated by the team members. During the treatment, they also explained hygiene knowledge to the farmers, and planned to set up demonstration hygiene toilets and wells in the suburbs, and will cooperate with the local government to establish short-term hygiene personnel training classes to conduct home visits, hygiene surveys, and disease surveys.
    ▲Under the leadership of Professor Jin Shanbao and others, students from seven departments of the Nanjing University Agricultural College established a rural service work experimental area in the rural areas along the city from Zhongyangmen to Yijiangmen in Nanjing. The main purpose is to integrate the school with the society, combine book knowledge with practice, and at the same time, help farmers improve production technically, so as to absorb experience. In the second half of last month, preliminary rural visits were made, and formal rural surveys were conducted starting on the 25th, and work such as trying out improved varieties, developing rural cooperatives, preventing and controlling livestock diseases, and running night schools and reading rooms will be carried out.

　　南京大学医农师生举办农村服务工作
    ▲南京大学医学院同学五十四人，医师五人，组成“南大医学院员生卫生服务队”，赴南京郊区农村设立医疗站，进行治疗工作，自十月十七日至上月二十七日，治疗病人一百五十余人，其中有两人是开刀治疗的。治疗仅收药品成本费，其他费用均由队员捐助。治疗中并对农民讲解卫生常识，并计划在郊区举办卫生厕所、水井示范，并将与地方政府配合，成立短期卫生人员训练班，作家庭访问、卫生调查、疾病调查等工作。
    ▲南京大学农学院七个系同学在金善宝等教授领导下，在南京中央门到挹江门沿城农村建立一个农村服务工作实验区。主要目的是使学校与社会打成一片，把书本知识与实际结合起来，同时在技术上帮助农民改进生产，从而吸取经验。在上月份下半月，已作了初步农村访问工作，二十五日起正式进行农村调查，将试办改良品种、发展农村合作社、防治畜病、举办夜校和阅览室等工作。
