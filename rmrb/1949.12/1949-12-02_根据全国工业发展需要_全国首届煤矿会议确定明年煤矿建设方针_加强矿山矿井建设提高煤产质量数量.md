　　According to the Needs of National Industrial Development
  　The First National Coal Mine Conference Determined the Coal Mine Construction Policy for Next Year
    Strengthen Mine and Well Construction, Improve Coal Production Quality and Quantity
    [Reported by this newspaper] The first National Coal Mine Conference convened in Beijing by the Central Fuel Industry Department, lasting fourteen days, concluded on the 30th of last month. Attendees included key cadres and engineering technicians from the Northeast, North China, and Shandong Coal Mine Administrations, as well as major coal mines such as Fushun, Huainan, and Zichuan. The conference first affirmed the main achievements of coal mine work nationwide: With the victory of the Liberation War, the main coal mining areas of the country have been completely liberated. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, thanks to the efforts of all employees, difficulties in equipment and technology have been overcome, production has been restored, the Liberation War has been supported, and various cadres have been cultivated and promoted among the on-the-job workers. Appropriate democratic reforms have been carried out in the old production management system. Mine management committees have been established in some mining areas, giving play to the production enthusiasm of the workers, establishing a dedicated responsibility system in production, increasing production efficiency in old mining areas by one-fold, and generally by 70 percent. The lives of employees have been initially improved. In the Northeast, a new democratic enterprise management policy has been preliminarily implemented, such as economic accounting, quota management, budgeting systems, and planned production and sales division of labor. The conference also reviewed some shortcomings that still exist in past coal mine work that need to be overcome. For example, the importance of technology in production has not been fully valued in various mining areas, resulting in backward production technology and unreasonable labor organization, which has prevented the rapid improvement of production efficiency, and even some technical cadres still harbor conservative ideas. Some mining areas, especially those that have been liberated recently, do not have a clear enough understanding of the idea of relying on the working class, and have not regarded it as a decisive policy. Therefore, there is a lack of democratic style in production, and the enthusiasm of workers is not fully expressed, which affects the proper improvement of production efficiency. Based on the imbalance of China's industrial development and the current production and recovery situation of various mining areas, and considering long-term plans to meet the needs of industrial recovery and development in various regions, the conference determined the specific policy for national coal mines in 1950. The focus of construction among national coal mines will be in the Northeast. It was agreed that in addition to restoring existing wells in the Northeast, a number of new shafts will be opened, striving to reach the highest production level of the Manchukuo era within three years. North China and East China will focus on restoration, vigorously restoring existing wells and opening a small number of new wells where possible. According to the needs of national railways, steel, electricity, other industries, and civilian coal consumption, it is planned to produce more than 30 million tons of coal in 1950.

　　根据全国工业发展需要
  　全国首届煤矿会议确定明年煤矿建设方针
    加强矿山矿井建设提高煤产质量数量
    【本报讯】中央燃料工业部在京召开之全国首届煤矿会议，历时十四天，业于上月三十日闭幕。出席者计有东北、华北、山东煤矿管理局及抚顺、淮南、淄川等主要煤矿之主要干部工程技术人员。大会首先肯定了全国煤矿工作的主要成绩为：随着解放战争的胜利，全国主要煤矿区已完全解放。几年来在共产党和人民政府正确领导下，由于全体职工的努力，克服了器材与技术的困难，恢复了生产，支援了解放战争，并在职员工人中培养和提拔了各种干部。对旧的生产管理制度进行了适当的民主改革，在某些矿区已建立了矿山管理委员会，发挥了职工群众的生产积极性，建立了生产中的专责制，使生产效率在老的矿区提高一倍，一般的都提高了百分之七十，职工生活初步得到了改善。在东北已初步实行了新民主主义的企业管理方针，如经济核算，定额管理，预决算制度，有计划的产销分工等。会议同时也检讨了过去煤矿工作中还存在着一些缺点，尚待克服，如各地矿区对技术在生产中的地位不够充分重视，致使生产技术落后，劳动组织不够合理，因之生产效率不能迅速提高，甚至在某些技术干部中还存在着保守思想。还有的矿区尤其解放不久的矿区对依靠工人阶级的思想不够明确，没有当成具有决定性意义的方针，因之在生产中缺乏民主作风，工人积极性表现不够，影响生产效率的适当提高。会议根据中国工业发展的不平衡与各矿区目前生产及恢复情况，从长期打算，适应各地区工业恢复与发展的需要，确定了一九五○年全国煤矿的具体方针。全国煤矿中建设重点为东北，同意东北除恢复旧有井口外，并新开凿的若干矿井，争取三年内达到伪满时代生产最高水平。华北华东则以恢复为主，大力进行恢复旧有井口，并根据可能情况，开采少数新井。根据全国铁路、钢铁、电力、及其他工业和民间用煤量的需要，计划于一九五○年产煤三千余万吨。
