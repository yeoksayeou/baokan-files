Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th. Since liberation, Hunan's trade union work, under the leadership of the Hunan Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Central China, has achieved initial success. The Hunan Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Central China dispatched a group of cadres to Changsha City and the three administrative regions of Changsha, Changde, and Yiyang in August this year after the liberation of Changsha to carry out trade union work. As of the middle of last month, Changsha City, Jinshi, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Liling, Changde, Xiangyin, Yueyang, Linxiang, Huarong, Nanxian, Yiyang, Hengyang and other counties and cities have successively convened representative meetings of workers and established trade union preparatory committees. As for the province-wide trade union preparatory committees for railways, highways, post offices, telecommunications, etc., as well as the trade union preparatory committees in Shaoyang and other newly liberated areas, they are also actively preparing for establishment. According to incomplete statistics, the number of industrial workers organized in Changsha and other counties and cities currently totals more than 40,000. The process of organizing trade unions in various places is generally as follows: first, publicizing the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government to the workers, explaining that the central task of the trade union is to organize the working class in order to fully restore and develop production, support the front, and strive to quickly and completely eliminate the enemy and liberate all of China. At the same time, the reactionary nature of the pseudo-trade unions in oppressing workers is exposed one by one, and the class consciousness of the workers is gradually enlightened through study and other methods, allowing the workers to establish trade union preparatory committees on their own. For example, the trade union preparatory committees of postal and telecommunications enterprises in Changsha City were organized by the workers themselves after studying policies and other matters. Under the leadership of the trade union preparatory committees, workers in many enterprises have established study groups and training classes to carry out study in an organized and planned manner, improving their political consciousness, thereby beginning to establish a new labor attitude, conscious labor discipline, and a system of criticism and self-criticism. Thanks to the cooperation of trade union work, the state-owned Xiangtan Xiangjiang Coal Mine and Changsha Antimony Products Factory, Yuxiang Yarn Factory and other units have launched production competitions in restoring and developing production, achieving considerable results. The sailors of the Xiangjiang Coal Mine, under the leadership of the Hunan Seamen's Trade Union Preparatory Committee, have also eliminated the long-standing practice of theft that existed during the Kuomintang rule. Workers in private factories such as the Changsha Zhongzhou Cotton Weaving Factory, under the leadership of the trade union preparatory committee, correctly handled labor-capital relations and improved production. In addition, the rapid restoration of transportation undertakings such as railways, highways, telecommunications, post offices, and shipping in various parts of Hunan cannot be separated from the close cooperation of trade union work.
　　Since the liberation of Hunan, some important experiences and lessons have been learned in trade union work. First of all, to do a good job in trade union work, it is necessary to promptly correct all forms of closed-doorism. Due to the thin cadre strength of Hunan's trade union work, and the fact that many cadres used to work in rural areas and were accustomed to individual activities, and feared that bad elements would seize the leadership of the trade union, they did not dare to boldly absorb trade union members, which stagnated trade union work. For example, out of more than 100,000 workers in Yueyang, Liling, and Xiangtan counties under the Changsha Special Zone, only more than 10,000 joined the trade union by the end of October. The trade union work in Yiyang County was still in the stage of investigation and research until mid-October, and they did not dare to boldly absorb trade union members. In addition, although the trade union work in Xiangjiang Coal Mine was carried out for two months, no trade union member was developed among the nearly 3,000 coal miners. These examples show that trade union work cannot be carried out well without correcting the tendency of closed-doorism. Secondly, trade union work must be combined with production work. Only in this way can trade union work be carried out smoothly and consolidated and developed. For example, the porcelain industry in Liling County was completely shut down before and after liberation. After liberation, in order to enable the porcelain industry to resume work quickly, trade union staff organized workers to study methods of resuming work and helped supervise and urge owners to resume business, thereby solving the workers' unemployment problem. The trade union was organized at the same time in the process of resuming work, so this kind of trade union was naturally supported by the workers. For another example, the Xiangtan County trade union was established in helping workers resolve wage disputes, so it was also supported by the workers. In addition, the trade union preparatory committees of Changsha's state-owned Yuxiang Yarn Factory and the private Zhongzhou Cotton Weaving Factory were able to truly lead and organize workers to improve production, establish prestige for the trade union among the workers, and thereby obtain consolidation and development. On the contrary, some trade unions have failed to take the restoration and development of production as the central work of the trade union, so they only have an empty shell of a trade union and have actually collapsed. For example, the Nanxian trade union once had some achievements when it was first established, but because the trade union leaders did not lead and organize workers to restore production according to the specific situation, but put forward some unrealistic "leftist" slogans, the work suffered losses as a result. Finally, trade union work must closely cooperate with administrative work. The place where trade union work and administrative work cooperate well, the production will recover and develop faster, and the trade union work will be sound. For example, the Xiangjiang Coal Mine trade union organized workers to respond to the call of the administrative leading organs to complete the October coal mining plan, and as a result, the plan was exceeded by 250 tons. In this way, the trade union was supported by both workers and administration. On the contrary, some state-owned enterprises mistakenly believed that organizing trade unions requires long-term education of workers before it is possible, or that trade unions have nothing to do with administration and are unwilling to actively help trade union work. At the same time, some cadres engaged in trade union work do trade union work in isolation, without cooperating with administrative work, which results in losses for both sides. For example, the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau originally did a good job in resuming work in the early days of liberation, but later, due to the failure of close cooperation between administrative and trade union work, the work was not further improved, and the work enthusiasm of the staff was affected.

　　及时总结经验克服偏向
　  湖南工会工作获成绩
    长沙等县市成立工会筹委会
  　对恢复、发展生产作用很大
    【新华社长沙五日电】湖南解放以来的工会工作，在华中总工会筹备委员会湖南办事处领导下，已经取得初步成绩。华中总工会筹备委员会湖南办事处于今年八月长沙解放后，就派出一批干部分赴长沙市和长沙、常德、益阳三个行政专区开展工会工作。截至上月中旬为止，长沙市、津市、株州、湘潭、醴陵、常德、湘阴、岳阳、临湘、华容、南县、益阳、衡阳等县市，都已先后召开过职工代表会议，成立了工会筹备委员会。至于铁路、公路、邮政、电讯等全省性的工会筹备委员会，以及邵阳等新近解放的地区的工会筹备委员会，也在积极筹备建立中。据不完全统计，长沙等县市已经组织起来的产业工人，目前共达四万余人。各地组织工会的过程一般地是，首先向工人们宣传中国共产党和人民政府的各种政策，说明工会的中心任务是要把工人阶级组织起来，以便全力恢复和发展生产，支援前线，争取迅速全部消灭敌人，解放全中国。同时，对于伪工会欺压工人的反动本质，一一加以揭露，并通过学习等方式，逐步启发工人们的阶级觉悟，放手让工人们自己去建立工会筹备委员会。例如，长沙市邮政、电讯等企业单位的工会筹备委员会，就是经过学习政策等以后，由职工自己动手组织起来的。在工会筹备委员会的领导下，许多企业单位的职工都成立了学习小组和学习班，有组织、有计划地进行学习，提高了政治觉悟，从而开始建立起新的劳动态度和自觉的劳动纪律，以及批评和检讨制度。由于工会工作的配合，公营湘潭湘江煤矿和长沙锑品制造厂、裕湘纱厂等单位，都在恢复和发展生产中开展了生产竞赛，取得不少成绩。湘江煤矿的船员们，且在湖南海员工会筹备委员会领导下，革除了国民党统治时期一向存在的偷窝风气。私营工厂如长沙中州棉织厂的工人们，也在工会筹备委员会领导下，正确处理了劳资关系，改进生产。此外，湖南各地的铁路、公路、电讯、邮政、航运等交通事业的迅速恢复，也和工会工作的密切配合不能分开。
    湖南解放以来在工会工作中得出了一些重要的经验教训。首先，要做好工会工作，必须及时纠正一切形式的关门主义偏向。由于湖南工会工作的干部力量单薄，以及许多干部过去在农村工作，习惯于个别活动的工作方式，和惟恐坏分子夺去工会领导权，因此不敢大胆放手地去吸收工会会员，使工会工作停滞不前。例如，长沙专区所属岳阳、醴陵、湘潭三县十多万工人，到十月底左右加入工会的仅有一万多人。益阳县的工会工作直到十月中旬还停留在调查研究的阶段，不敢放手去吸收工会会员。此外，如湘江煤矿的工会工作虽然做了二个月，结果在近三千的煤矿工人中没有发展一个工会会员。这些例子说明不纠正关门主义的偏向，就不能很好地开展工会工作。其次，工会工作必须和生产工作相结合。只有这样，才能顺利地开展工会工作，并使之巩固和发展起来。例如，醴陵县的瓷器工业，在解放前后即全部停工，解放后，工会工作人员为使瓷业能够迅速复工，便组织工人研究复工办法，并帮助督促业主复业，由此解决了工人的失业问题。在进行复工中间同时组织了工会，这样的工会就很自然地受到工人们的拥护。再如湘潭县的工会，是在帮助工人解决工资争议中建立起来的，所以同样受到工人们的拥护。此外，如长沙公营裕湘纱厂和私营中州棉织厂的工会筹备委员会，都是因为真正能领导和组织工人提高生产，使工会在工人中间树立威信，并由此获得巩固和发展。相反的，也有一些工会因为没有把恢复和发展生产作为工会的中心工作，所以只剩下一个工会的空壳，实际上早已垮了台。例如，南县的工会，在初建立时曾经有过一些成绩，但是因为工会领导人员没有根据具体情况去领导和组织工人恢复生产，只是提出一些脱离实际的“左”的口号，结果使工作受了损失。最后，工会工作必须和行政工作密切配合。那个地方工会工作和行政工作配合得好，那个地方的生产便恢复和发展得快，工会工作也就健全。例如，湘江煤矿的工会，组织工人响应行政领导机关完成十月份采煤计划的号召，结果超过计划二百五十吨。这样，工会就受到工人和行政两方面的拥护。相反的，也有一些公营企业单位，由于接管工作干部错误地认为，组织工会需要长期教育工人以后才有可能，或者认为工会和行政无关，不愿主动地去帮助工会工作。同时，也有些工会工作的干部，孤立地去做工会工作，不和行政工作配合，结果就使两方面的工作都受到损失。例如长沙市电讯局，解放初期的复工工作本来做得很好，但是后来由于行政和工会工作不能紧密配合，工作便没有进一步提高，而且使职工的工作情绪受到影响。
