    A businessman said: "The Communist Party cadres are not corrupt, which is really better than the Kuomintang, but there are also downsides, which is that they don't give special treatment; business is not easy to do."
    Yes. In some people's eyes, not accepting bribes, not engaging in malpractice and favoritism, means "not giving special treatment." If there is no special treatment, there are no loopholes to exploit—smuggling, tax evasion, speculation… all the activities of harming the public and benefiting oneself are "not easy to do." Of course, there are "downsides" in the good; however, for the broad masses of the people, it is extremely good.

    一个商人说：“共产党的干部不贪污，实在比国民党好，但也有不好，就是不讲人情，生意不好做。”
    是的。在有些人看来，不受贿赂，不舞弊徇私，就是“不讲人情”，不讲人情，就无空子可钻——偷关漏税，投机倒把……一切损公肥己的勾当都“不好做”，当然也就好中有“不好”了；不过，这对广大的人民来说，却是太好太好了。
