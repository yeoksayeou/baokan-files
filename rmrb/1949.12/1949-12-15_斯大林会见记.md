　　A Meeting with Stalin
    By Luokejifu
    This happened at the end of October 1918. Our troops were stationed near Tsaritsyn, which had recently been incorporated into the Red Army's 10th Division. A fierce battle had just ended, and we had taught the White Army a good lesson.

    After the battle, we had a short rest, and the soldiers were repairing their uniforms, cleaning their guns, and mending their clothes. It is also necessary to say that our material conditions and equipment were very poor at that time. For example, in my artillery team, each cannon only had seven shells—two mine shells, two shrapnel shells, and three high-explosive shells. The entire division only had one six-inch cannon, which we proudly called "the Mother of the Revolution." Whenever she appeared in a regiment, the morale of the soldiers immediately soared. The infantry's equipment was even worse. Some people had rifles, others had shotguns, and many held ordinary hunting guns. The soldiers' cartridge belts were never full, with only ten or fifteen bullets each.

    One evening, we were notified that Comrades Stalin and Voroshilov would be coming to visit us tomorrow. Everyone was extremely busy, starting to organize the troops. The soldiers were busy cleaning their guns and cannons and hurriedly mending their uniforms.

    The day of the inspection arrived. The entire division stood in formation, waiting. On the left flank where the infantry stood, someone suddenly shouted "Hurrah!" It turned out that our troops were welcoming the arrival of Comrades Stalin and Voroshilov.

    Comrades Stalin and Voroshilov walked around our entire division. The commander shouted the order "At ease." Comrade Voroshilov happened to stand not far from our artillery, talking to the commanders. At this moment, Comrade Stalin left his companions and walked towards us. He walked towards the cannon standing next to me. Comrade Stalin asked:

    Who is the artillery commander?

    —It's me, Luokejifu—

    I replied, and I put my left hand on my cap brim and reported to him. My right hand was in a sling.

    Comrade Stalin first asked what happened to my hand. I replied that my hand was injured in the battle near Dabaibulnik. Comrade Stalin advised me to go to the Tsaritsyn military hospital for treatment.

    —I change bandages at the division hospital—I said.

    —Comrade Luokejifu—Comrade Stalin said kindly—the field hospital won't help you much; you'll get tetanus. I advise you to go to Tsaritsyn…—He patted my shoulder with a fatherly concern. Then he asked about the morale of the officers and soldiers, and about our material conditions and equipment.

    Speaking of these situations, I said frankly: one of my cannons was broken, the soldiers often felt that they didn’t have enough bullets, and the problem of clothing supply was not even worth mentioning.

    Comrade Stalin smiled slightly and replied:

    —It doesn't matter, Comrade Luokejifu, we will help you as much as possible.

    Naturally, Comrade Stalin's words were not empty. After a few days—five or six days later—the broken cannon was replaced with a new one. A lot of ammunition and bullets were replenished, and new bedding was issued to the officers and soldiers. The whole division often talked about Comrade Stalin's concern for us. The fighting spirit of the officers and soldiers reached an unprecedented high. We soon set off and crushed the White Army with new strength.

    Many years have passed, but Comrade Stalin and his kind smile, and his particularly kind and meaningful gaze, still often appear before my eyes, as if he had just talked to me yesterday.

    I am forty-four years old, but I am ready to serve as an artillery commander again at Comrade Stalin's first call. Now, like a Red Army soldier, I work in a factory, I want to be vigilant in my work, and I want to work in the Stakhanovite way.

    I sincerely wish our beloved Comrade Stalin a long life.
                                                                               (Translated by Qiujiang) (Reprinted from Dalian Shishi News)

　　斯大林会见记
    洛克吉夫  作
    这件事情发生在一九一八年十月底。我们的部队驻扎在察里津近郊，它不久前才编入红军第十师。剧烈的战斗刚刚结束，我们给了白党一个很好的教训。
    战斗过后得到一个很短的休息机会，战士们在修整服装、擦枪、缝补衣服。还需要告诉大家说，当时我们的物质待遇和装备都很坏。例如在我的炮队里，每门炮只有七发炮弹——两发地雷弹、两发榴霰弹、三发榴弹。整个师只有一门六英寸口径的大炮，我们很自豪地把好叫做“革命的母亲”。随便什么时候，只要她出现在某一个团里，那么这个团的战士们的情绪立刻高涨起来。步兵的装备更是糟糕，一部分人拿步枪，另一部分人拿猎枪，有很多人则抱着一枝普通的鸟枪。战士们的子弹袋从来没有装满的，每人只有十发或十五发子弹。
    有一天晚上，我们得到通知，斯大林和伏罗希洛夫同志明天要到我们这里来。大家忙得不可开交，开始整理部队。战士们忙着擦枪、擦炮，赶紧缝补自己的军衣。
    检阅的日子来到了。全师人都站起队来等着。在站着步兵的左翼忽然喊着“乌拉”。原来我们的部队是在欢迎斯大林和伏罗希洛夫同志的来临。
    斯大林和伏罗希洛夫同志环绕着我们的整个师团走过去，指挥员喊着“稍息”的口令。伏罗希洛夫同志偶然站在离我们炮兵不远的地方与指挥员们谈话，在这个时候，斯大林同志离开了他的同伴向我们这边走来。他向那门站在我身旁的大炮走来，斯大林同志问：
    炮兵指挥员是谁？
    ——是我，洛克吉夫——
    我回答，而且我把左手放在帽檐上向他报告。我的右手是用绷带吊着的。
    斯大林同志首先问我的手怎么啦。我回答他，我的手在大采布尔尼克附近战斗中受了伤。斯大林同志劝我到察里津军医院去医治。
    ——我到师部医院换绷带——我说。
    ——洛克吉夫同志——斯大林同志亲切地说——野战医院对你帮助不大，你会要得破伤风病的。我劝你还是到察里津去一趟吧……——他用一种父亲式的关怀拍了拍我的肩膀。随后他又问到指战员们的情绪，问到我们的物质待遇及装备状况。
    谈到这些情况时我率直地说了：我的一门炮已经坏了，战士们的子弹常常感到不够用，而服装供给的问题，更是值不得一提。
    斯大林同志微微地笑了笑回答：
    ——没有关系，洛克吉夫同志，尽我们最大的可能帮助你们。
    自然啦，斯大林同志的话并不是白说的。过了没几天——五、六天之后，坏了的大炮换上新的了。补充了很多炮弹和子弹，发给指战员们新的被服。全师的人时常谈到斯大林同志对我们的这种关怀。指战员们的战斗情绪达到了空前未有的提高。我们很快地出发了，并以新的力量粉碎了白党。
    已经过去了很多年了，然而，斯大林同志及他那种亲切的微笑，和他那一种特别亲切的，意味深长的视线，现在仍时常出现在我的眼前，好象他昨天才跟我谈过话似的。
    我已经四十四岁了，但是，我准备遵照斯大林同志的第一次召唤再次担任炮兵指挥。现在，我象一个红军战士一样的在工厂里做工，我要警惕我自己的工作岗位，我要象斯达哈诺夫式的工作着。
    我衷心地希望着我们敬爱的斯大林同志万寿无疆。
