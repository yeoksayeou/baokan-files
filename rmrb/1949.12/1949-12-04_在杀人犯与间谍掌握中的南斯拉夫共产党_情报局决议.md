　　The Yugoslav Communist Party in the Hands of Murderers and Spies
　　Cominform Resolution

The Information Bureau, composed of representatives from the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Romanian Workers' Party, the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the French Communist Party, and the Czechoslovak and Italian Communist Parties, having considered the question of "The Yugoslav Communist Party in the Hands of Murderers and Spies," unanimously reached the following conclusion:

The Information Bureau's meeting in June 1948 noted that the Tito-Ranković group, in the period after the Information Bureau meeting, transitioned from democracy and socialism to bourgeois nationalism. Now, this group has completed the entire path from bourgeois nationalism to fascism and openly betraying the interests of the Yugoslav people. Recent events show that the Yugoslav government is completely dependent on foreign imperialist groups and has become a tool of their aggressive policies, resulting in the elimination of the independence of the Yugoslav Republic.

The Central Committee and government of the Yugoslav party have completely sided with the imperialist groups, opposing the entire socialist and democratic camp, communist parties worldwide, new democratic countries, and the Soviet Union.

The group of hired spies and murderers in Belgrade are engaged in blatant collusion with imperialist reactionary forces and are serving them. The Rajk-Brankov trial in Budapest has clearly demonstrated this.

This trial shows that the current rulers of Yugoslavia have fled from the camp of democracy and socialism to the camp of imperialism and reaction, have become direct accomplices of the instigators of a new war, and are currying favor with the imperialists and kowtowing to them through their betrayal.

The Tito group's transformation to fascism is not accidental. It was carried out on the orders of their masters, the American imperialists. It is now clear that the Tito group has long been mercenaries of the American imperialists.

Following the will of the imperialists, the Yugoslav traitors have begun to establish political gangs composed of reactionaries, nationalists, priests, and fascists in the people's democratic countries, relying on these gangs to carry out counter-revolutionary coups in these countries, detach them from the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, and subordinate them to imperialist forces.

The Tito group has turned Belgrade into a center for American espionage and anti-communist propaganda.

While all true friends of peace, democracy, and socialism consider the Soviet Union to be a powerful bastion of socialism, a faithful and resolute defender of the freedom and independence of all nations, and the main bulwark of peace, the Tito-Ranković group, after seizing power by feigning friendship with the Soviet Union, launched a campaign to slander the Soviet Union and provoke it on the orders of British and American imperialists, using the most despicable slanderous language borrowed from Hitler's arsenal.

The process of the Tito-Ranković group becoming direct agents of imperialism and accomplices of warmongers culminated in the Yugoslav government's alignment with the imperialist group in the United Nations. In the United Nations, the Kardelj's, Djilas's, and Bebler's have formed a united front with American reactionaries on extremely important issues of international policy.

Within the scope of domestic policy, the main result of the activities of the traitorous Tito-Ranković group is the actual elimination of the people's democratic system in Yugoslavia.

Due to the counter-revolutionary policies of the Tito-Ranković group, which seized power within the party and the country, an anti-communist police state - a fascist regime - has been established in Yugoslavia.

The foundation of this regime is composed of wealthy peasants in the countryside and capitalist elements in the cities.

In fact, power in Yugoslavia is in the hands of anti-people reactionaries. Active members of past bourgeois political parties, wealthy peasants, and other enemies of people's democracy are active in central and local government agencies.

The fascist rulers rely on an extremely bloated military and police apparatus, and rely on these tools to oppress the people of all nationalities in Yugoslavia.

They have turned the country into a barracks, stripping the working people of all democratic rights, and trampling on the freedom to express any opinion.

The Yugoslav rulers are coaxingly and insultingly deceiving the people, insisting that they are building socialism in Yugoslavia.

Every Marxist understands that when the Tito group broke with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist and democratic camp (thus causing Yugoslavia to lose the main bulwark for building socialism), and when Yugoslavia became economically and politically subordinate to British and American imperialists, there can be no talk of building socialism in Yugoslavia.

The state-owned part of the Yugoslav economy is no longer the property of the people, because state power is in the hands of the people's enemies.

The Tito-Ranković group has created great possibilities for foreign capital to invade the Yugoslav economy and has placed the economy under the rule of monopoly capitalists.

British and American industrial-financial groups are investing their capital in the Yugoslav economy, turning Yugoslavia into an agricultural-raw material appendage of foreign capital.

Yugoslavia's increasing slavish dependence on imperialism has intensified the exploitation of the working class and severely worsened the conditions of the working class.

The Yugoslav rulers' policies in the countryside are of a wealthy peasant-capitalist nature.

The compulsory fake cooperatives in the countryside are under the constant control of wealthy peasants and their agents, and these fake cooperatives have become tools for exploiting the broad masses of laboring peasants.

The imperialist Yugoslav lackeys, after seizing the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party, launched a terror campaign against genuine communists who were loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and who had fought for Yugoslavia to free itself from imperialists.

Thousands of Yugoslav patriots dedicated to communism have been expelled from the party and detained in prisons and concentration camps. Many were tortured in prisons and killed. As was the fate of the well-known communist Arso Jovanović, who was cowardly assassinated.

The cruelty with which steadfast communist fighters are killed in Yugoslavia can only be compared to the atrocities of the Hitler fascists or the executioners Tsaldaris in Greece or Franco in Spain. While expelling communists loyal to proletarian internationalism from the ranks of the party and killing them, the Yugoslav fascists opened the doors of the party to bourgeois and wealthy peasant elements.

As a result of the fascist terror inflicted by the Tito gang on the healthy forces of the Yugoslav Communist Party, the party's leading organs have been completely controlled by spies and murderers – imperialist lackeys.

The Yugoslav Communist Party has been seized by counter-revolutionary forces, acting arbitrarily in the name of the party. As is well known, buying spies and informers into the ranks of the working-class party is an old trick of the bourgeoisie.

The imperialists are trying to subvert these parties from within by this method and subordinate them to them. They have achieved this goal in Yugoslavia.

The Tito group's fascist ideology, fascist domestic policies, and treacherous foreign policy, which are completely subordinate to foreign imperialist groups, have created a chasm between the Tito-Ranković spy-fascist group and the vital interests of the freedom-loving peoples of Yugoslavia.

As a result, the Tito group's anti-people traitorous actions are being met with increasing resistance from communists, the working class, and laboring peasants in Yugoslavia who remain loyal to Marxism and Leninism. Based on the indisputable facts that prove the Tito group has completely turned to fascism and has joined the camp of world imperialism, the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties believes that:

1. The gang of spies Tito, Ranković, Kardelj, Djilas, Pijade, Gošnjak, Maslarić, Bebler, Mrazović, Vukmanović, K. Popović, Kidrič, Nešković, Zlatić, Velebit, Koliševski, etc., are enemies of the working class and peasants, and enemies of the peoples of Yugoslavia.

2. This spy group does not represent the will of the Yugoslav people, but rather the will of the British and American imperialists, and therefore has betrayed the interests of the country and canceled Yugoslavia's political sovereignty and economic independence.

3. The "Yugoslav Communist Party" as currently constituted, controlled by the enemies of the people – murderers and spies – has lost the right to be called a communist party, and is merely a tool for carrying out the spy missions of the Tito-Kardelj-Ranković-Djilas group.

Therefore, the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties believes that the struggle against the Tito group – hired spies and murderers – is the international responsibility of all communist and workers' parties.

Communist and workers' parties have a duty to give all possible assistance to the Yugoslav working class and laboring peasants, who are fighting to return Yugoslavia to the camp of democracy and socialism.

A necessary condition for Yugoslavia's return to the socialist camp is the active struggle of revolutionary elements within and outside the ranks of the Yugoslav Communist Party to revive a revolutionary, genuine Yugoslav Communist Party – loyal to Marxism-Leninism, loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and fighting for Yugoslavia to free itself from imperialism and seek independence.

The loyal communist forces in Yugoslavia are currently under the brutal environment of fascist terror and have no possibility of engaging in open activities against the Tito-Ranković group. In their struggle for the cause of communism, they are forced to adopt the methods adopted by communists in countries where legal activities are prohibited.

The Information Bureau firmly believes that among the workers and peasants of Yugoslavia, there will be forces that can guarantee the victory over the Tito-Ranković spy group that is restoring the bourgeoisie, firmly believes that the laboring people of Yugoslavia under the leadership of the working class will be able to restore the historical fruits of people's democracy – the fruits won by the Yugoslav people through great sacrifices and heroic struggles, and firmly believes that they will take the road of building socialism.

The Information Bureau believes that one of the most important tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to raise revolutionary vigilance everywhere in the ranks of the party; expose and eradicate bourgeois nationalists and imperialist lackeys, no matter what banner they use to cover themselves.

The Information Bureau believes that it is necessary to carry out more ideological work in the Communist and Workers' Parties; to carry out more work to educate communist party members in the spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism, in the spirit of irreconcilability to any departure from Marxist-Leninist principles, and in the spirit of loyalty to people's democracy and socialism.

### 在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党　情报局决议

　　在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党
  　情报局决议
    由保加利亚共产党、罗马尼亚工人党、匈牙利劳动人民党、波兰统一工人党、苏联共产党（布尔什维克）、法国共产党、和捷克斯洛伐克及意大利共产党代表组成的情报局，于考虑过“在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党”这一问题以后，一致达成如下结论：
    共产党情报局一九四八年六月的会议曾注意到铁托——兰科维奇集团在情报局会议以后的时期内从民主主义和社会主义转变到资产阶级的民族主义这一事实，如今这个集团已经走完了从资产阶级民族主义到法西斯主义及公然叛卖南斯拉夫民族利益的全部路程。　最近的事变表明：南斯拉夫政府是完完全全依赖外国帝国主义集团的，并且已经变成了它们侵略政策的一个工具，这结果使南斯拉夫共和国的独立就消灭了。
    南斯拉夫的党的中央委员会与政府，已经与帝国主义集团完全同流合污，反对整个社会主义与民主阵营，反对世界各国共产党，反对新民主国家和苏联。
    贝尔格莱德的雇佣间谍及杀人犯集团，与帝国主义反动力量进行罪恶昭彰的勾当，并为帝国主义反动力量服务，布达佩斯的拉伊克——布兰科夫审判案，已十分清楚的说明了这一点。
    这一审判显示，南斯拉夫现在的统治者已经由民主与社会主义阵营中逃跑而投奔到帝国主义与反动阵营中，已经变成新战争挑拨者的直接同谋犯，并且正以他们的叛卖行为向帝国主义者讨好，向他们叩头。
    铁托集团的转变到法西斯主义，并不是偶然的。这是奉他们的主子——美帝国主义者的命令实行的。现在已很清楚，铁托集团很久以来就是美帝国主义者的雇佣兵。
    南斯拉夫叛徒遵照帝国主义者的意旨，已着手在人民民主国家成立由反动分子、民族主义分子、牧师和法西斯分子组成的政治伙帮，要依靠这些伙帮在这些国家中实行反革命政变，使这些国家脱离苏联和整个社会主义阵营并使它们从属于帝国主义力量。
    铁托集团把贝尔格莱德变成了美国的间谍活动和反共宣传的中心。
    当一切和平、民主与社会主义的真实友人认为苏联是社会主义的强大堡垒、各民族自由与独立的忠实而坚决的保卫者与和平的主要屏障的时候，铁托——兰科维奇集团在凭借对苏友好的假面具而取得政权之后，奉英美帝国主义的命令发动了诽谤苏联及向苏联挑衅的运动，使用着从希特勒的武库中借来的最卑鄙的诽谤语言。
　铁托——兰科维奇集团变为帝国主义的直接代理人与战争贩子同谋犯的过程，以南斯拉夫政府在联合国组织中与帝国主义集团一致行动为最高点。在联合国组织中，卡德尔辈、德热拉斯辈与贝勃勒辈已经在国际政策的极为重要的问题上和美国反动派组成了联合战线。
    在内政政策范围内，叛徒铁托——兰科维奇集团之活动的主要结果，就是人民民主制度在南斯拉夫被实际消灭。
    由于在党内和国内窃取到权力的铁托——兰科维奇集团的反革命政策，一个反共的警察国家——法西斯式政权已经在南斯拉夫设置起来。
    这一政权的基础，是由乡村中的富农和城市中的资本主义成分组成的。
    事实上，南斯拉夫的政权是掌握在反人民的反动分子的手中。过去的各资产阶级政党的活动党员、富农及其他人民民主的敌人，在中央和地方政府机构中活跃着。
    法西斯统治头子们依赖着极臃肿的军警工具，并靠这些工具来压迫南斯拉夫各民族人民。
    他们已经把国家变成了一个兵营，把劳动人民一切民主权利剥夺干净，把表示任何意见的自由践踏在脚底下。
    南斯拉夫的统治者们，笼络人心地和侮谩地欺骗人民，硬说他们正在南斯拉夫建设社会主义。
    每一个马克思主义者都明白，当铁托集团与苏联及整个社会主义与民主阵营破裂的时候，（因此就使南斯拉夫丧失了建设社会主义的主要堡垒），当南斯拉夫在经济上和政治上从属于英美帝国主义者的时候，在南斯拉夫是谈不上建设社会主义的。
    南斯拉夫经济的国营部分已经不再是人民的财产了，因为国家的权力是操在人民的敌人的手里。
    铁托——兰科维奇集团为外国资本侵入南斯拉人经济，创造了巨大可能性，并将经济置于垄断资本家的统治之下。
    英美产业——金融集团把他们的资本投在南斯拉夫的经济中，正把南斯夫变为外国资本的农业——原料的附庸。
    南斯拉夫愈益对帝国主义奴隶性的依赖，使对工人阶级的剥削加重，使工人阶级的处境更严重地恶化了。
    南斯拉夫统治者在乡村中的政策，具有富农——资本主义的性质。
    乡村里的强迫性的假合作社是在富农及其代理人的常握之下的，这种假合作社成为剥削广大劳动农民群众的工具。
    帝国主义的南斯拉夫走狗，在攫得南斯拉夫共产党的领导地位之后，就对忠于马克思主义——列宁主义原则并且在为争取南斯拉夫摆脱帝国主义者而获得独立的真正共产党人发动恐怖运动。
    数以千计的献身于在共产主义的南斯拉夫爱国者，被驱逐出党并被拘禁在监狱和集中营里。许多人在监狱里受到酷刑拷打并且被杀死。正如著名的共产党人阿尔索·尤伐诺维奇所遭遇的那样，被卑怯地加以暗杀。
    坚贞不屈的共产主义战士在南斯拉夫遭到杀害时的残酷程度，只有希特勒法西斯分子或希腊的郐子手曹达利斯或西班牙的佛朗哥的暴行才能和它相比拟。　 南斯拉夫法西斯分子一面将忠于无产阶级国际主义的共产党人驱逐出党的队伍并加以杀害，一面则向资产阶级和富农分子敞开党的大门。
    铁托匪帮对南斯拉夫共产党的健全力量施以法西斯恐怖的结果，党的领导机构就完全掌握在间谍和杀人犯——帝国主义走狗的手中了。
    南斯拉夫共产党已被反革命力量所夺取，专横地以党的名义行动。如众所周知，在工人阶级政党的队伍里收买间谍和奸细，这是资产阶级的老办法。
    帝国主义者力图用这种办法从内部来颠覆这些党，而使之从属于他们。他们已在南斯拉夫实现了这个目的。
    完全从属于外国帝国主义集团的铁托集团的法西斯思想，法西斯内政政策，及背信弃义的外交政策，已在铁托——兰科维奇间谍法西斯集团与南斯拉夫爱好自由的各族人民的切身利益之间造成了一条鸿沟。
    结果，铁托集团反人民的叛逆行动，正遭受到南斯拉夫国内那些仍然忠实于马克思主义和列宁主义的共产党人、工人阶级及劳动农民日益增长的抵抗。　 根据证明铁托集团完全变为法西斯主义并已投到世界帝国主义阵营的无可争办的事实，共产党与工人党的情报局认为：
    一、铁托、兰科维奇、卡德尔、德热拉斯、比雅杰、哥斯尼雅克、马斯拉利奇、贝勃勒、姆拉佐维奇、乌克马诺维奇、ｋ·波波维奇、基德利奇、涅斯科维奇、兹拉提区、威列比特、科利雪夫斯基等一伙间谍，是工人阶级与农民的敌人，是南斯拉夫各族人民的敌人。
    二、这个间谍集团并不代表南斯拉夫人民的意志，而是代表英美帝国主义者的意志，因此就出卖了国家的利益，取消了南斯拉夫的政治主权和经济独立。
    三、象目前这样组成的“南斯拉夫共产党”，掌握在人民的敌人——杀人犯和间谍的手中，业已丧失了称为共产党的权利，而仅仅是执行铁托——卡德尔——兰科维奇——德热拉斯集团的间谍任务的工具。
    因此，共产党与工人党情报局认为：反对铁托集团——受人雇用的间谍与杀人犯——的斗争，是一切共产党和工人党的国际责任。
    共产党和工人党有责任给南斯拉夫工人阶级和劳动农民以一切可能的援助，他们正在为使南斯拉夫回到民主与社会主义阵营而斗争。
    南斯拉夫回到社会主义阵营的一个必要条件，是南斯拉夫共产党内和党的队伍之外的革命分子的积极斗争，争取革命的、真正的南斯拉夫共产党——忠于马克思列宁主义、忠于无产阶级国际主义原则，并为南斯拉夫摆脱帝国主义求得独立而斗争的党的再生。
    南斯拉夫的忠诚的共产主义力量，目前处在法西斯恐怖的残暴环境之下，没有可能从事反铁托——兰科维奇集团的公开活动。他们在为共产主义事业的斗争中，被迫采取在禁止合法活动的国家中的共产党人所采取的方法。
    情报局坚决相信，在南斯拉夫的工人和农民中，将有能够保证战胜使资产阶级复辟的铁托——兰科维奇间谍集团的力量，坚信工人阶级领导下的南斯拉夫劳动人民，将能恢复人民民主的历史果实——南斯拉夫人民以重大的牺牲和英勇的斗争所赢得的果实，并坚信他们将采取建设社会主义的道路。
    情报局认为：共产党和工人党最重要的任务之一，是在党的队伍中处处提高革命警惕性；揭露并根除资产阶级民族主义分子和帝国主义走卒，不论他们是用什么旗子来掩护自己。
    情报局认为：必须在共产党和工人党中进行更多的思想工作；进行更多的工作，以忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神，以对任何背离马列主义原则的不可调和性，以忠于人民民主与社会主义的精神，来教育共产党员。
