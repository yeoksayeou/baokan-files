The spokesperson for the Democratic National Construction Association issued the following opinion regarding the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds:

The issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, as its name suggests, is decided for the need to win the final victory of the people's revolutionary war and ensure this historic people's victory. Every Chinese person, for their own victory, will inevitably enthusiastically support this decision and work together to achieve the successful completion of the tasks set by this decision.

The issuance of public bonds is entirely based on the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests." The three price fluctuations of the past year have already taught everyone a lesson: the crisis of inflation must be gradually overcome; otherwise, it will cause panic in people's lives and make it impossible for the country's economic recovery to move forward steadily. In the efforts and achievements of overcoming these three price fluctuations, everyone has also come to realize that our currency crisis is completely different from the currency crisis of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Each time we overcome a crisis, we make progress in terms of mobilizing strength, strategic deployment, and tactical application. As Chairman Mao said, "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." This issuance of public bonds may be the last mobilization to overcome the currency crisis. Based on the experience of the Northeast, this mobilization will basically eliminate the currency crisis and achieve relative economic stability. For the sake of the new country and the interests of all the people, the issuance of public bonds is necessary.

The issuance of public bonds is, of course, a burden on the people. This burden is not only glorious but also ultimately beneficial. "The raising, repayment of principal, and payment of interest on public bonds are all calculated based on real goods," which fully takes into account the interests of bond purchasers. Buying public bonds has a guarantee of principal in real goods, and you can also get interest at an annual rate of five percent, which is more beneficial than hoarding materials. The most ideal objects for hoarding materials are nothing more than rice, flour, cloth, and coal. After buying them, you also have to pay storage fees and risk quality losses. Once you are reported by the people, you will also be subject to legal sanctions. So, why not buy public bonds, which are both glorious and profitable? This is indeed in line with the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests."

The main target for this public bond solicitation is, of course, urban industrialists, businesspeople, and the general public. During the revolutionary war, farmers contributed people and money, and even now, their burden is heavier than that of urban residents. We can no longer ask them to bear more. In order to gradually implement the principle of "reasonable burden" in the Common Program, this issuance of public bonds must be mainly borne by industrialists, businesspeople, and urban residents. It will certainly tighten credit, making some industrialists and businesspeople feel that their turnover is difficult. However, precisely because of this, prices can be stabilized, which will benefit the masses, and ultimately benefit legitimate industry and commerce. For industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, the government will, of course, take care of their reasonable needs to ensure that production and material adjustment are not hindered. Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out that this is a "victory difficulty, a victory burden." Because the revolutionary war has basically achieved victory, as long as everyone actively takes on the burden, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties. The Association is willing to call on industrialists and businesspeople across the country, in the position of one of the four classes in the new regime, to work hard to promote this public bond issuance with a happy and serious attitude.

We have read the report of Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Northeast People's Government. Over the past four years in the Northeast, the lives of workers, farmers, and technicians have been greatly improved, production has steadily recovered, and the economy has become increasingly prosperous. This year, prices have been relatively stable, and according to our understanding, the issuance of public bonds in the Northeast this spring played a major role in stabilizing prices. Next year, the Northeast may also strive to balance revenue and expenditure. This indeed confirms that we "have solutions and have hope." Vice Chairman Li also pointed out that the national revenue and expenditure budget for next year is much better than the situation in the Northeast in 1948. Therefore, we can hope that next year the whole country, after the successful raising of this public bond, may strive to achieve the situation of the Northeast this year. Therefore, we can recognize how significant the issuance of this public bond is. Its use is completely different from the public bonds of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who plundered the people's wealth to enrich themselves. Its credit is also completely different from the public bonds of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who only deceived the people and eventually brought about their own destruction. The people of the whole country have learned from experience that the promises of the Communist Party can be fulfilled. The public bonds issued by the Central People's Government under the leadership of the CCP today have unquestionable credit. A public bond with great significance and solid credit will surely receive the unanimous support of the people of the whole country.

　　民主建国会发言人发表意见
  　拥护发行胜利公债决定
    【本报讯】民主建国会发言人对于发行人民胜利折实公债表示如下的意见：
    人民胜利折实公债的发行，正如它的名称所表示的，是为着争取人民革命战争的最后胜利和保证这一个历史性的人民胜利的需要而决定的。每一个中国人民为着自己的胜利，必然会热烈的拥护这一个决定，并为这一个决定的任务的圆满达成而共同努力。
    公债的发行，完全依据“公私兼顾”的原则。一年来三次物价的波动，已经使大家得到教训，通货膨胀的危机必须逐步的加以克服，否则便会造成人民生活的恐慌，使国家经济恢复无法稳步的前进。在战胜这三次物价波动的努力和成效当中，大家也已经得到了认识，我们的货币危机完全不同于国民党反动派的货币危机。我们每一次战胜危机，在实力的动员上，战略的部署和战术的运用上，都是进步的。这正如毛主席所说是“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”这次发行公债，可能是克服货币危机最后一次的动员。依据东北的经验，这一次的动员将会基本上消灭货币危机，取得了相对的经济稳定。为新国家着想，为全体人民的利益着想，发行公债都是必须的。
    公债的发行当然是人民的负担，这种负担不但是光荣的，而且是终久有利的。“公债的募集及还本付息，均以实物为计算标准”，就是充分照顾到购债人的利益。买公债能有实物保本的保证，还可以得到年息五厘的利息，比囤积物资都有利。囤积物资的最理想的对象，也莫过于米面布煤了。买到了之后，还须支付保管费，又要冒质量损耗的危险，一旦被人民检举了，还要受法律的制裁。那何如买公债，既光荣，而且有利息。这的确是符合“公私兼顾”的原则的了。
    这一次公债劝募的主要对象，当然是城市的工商业者和市民大众。农民在革命战争当中，出人出钱，一直到现在，他们的负担还比市民沉重，不能再叫他们负担了。为着逐步实行共同纲领中“合理负担”的原则。这一次公债的发行必须主要的由工商业者和市民来负担。它当然会抽紧银根，使得某些工商业者感到周转困难，然而，也正因为如此，才能使物价稳定，才能对大众有益，结果对于正当工商业也会有益。对于有利于国计民生的工商业，政府当然会照顾到他们的合理需要，务使生产和物资调剂不会受到妨害。陈云副总理指出，这是“胜利的困难，胜利的负担。”因为革命战争已经基本取得胜利，只要大家踊跃的负担，我们便一定可以克服任何的困难。本会愿意号召全国的工商业者，以新政权中四个阶级之一的地位，用愉快而严肃的心情，来努力推进这一次公债发行工作。
    我们读到了东北人民政府李富春副主席的报告，东北四年以来，工农和技术人员的生活均已大大的提高，生产已经稳步的恢复，经济已经日趋繁荣；今年物价已经相对的稳定，而据我们的了解，今春东北公债的发行，起着稳定物价的主要作用。明年东北还可能争取收支的平衡。这的确证实了我们是“有办法、有希望”的。李副主席还指出明年度全国的收支概算，比一九四八年的东北情况要好得多，因此，我们就可以希望明年的全国，经过了这一次公债的圆满募集，可能争取到今年东北的情况。因此我们可以认识这一次公债的发行，意义是何等的重大？它的用途完全不同于国民党反动派搜括人民财富以自肥的公债，它的信用更完全不同于国民反动派一味欺骗人民终于自取灭亡的公债。全国人民已经从事实体验到，共产党的诺言都是能够兑现的，今天在中共领导之下的中央人民政府所发行的公债它的信用是毋庸置疑的，意义重大信用巩固的公债，一定可以得到全国人民的一致拥护。
