Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd:

Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army telegraphed replies to General Wang Boxun, former commander of the 19th Army Corps of the Kuomintang Army, and General Zhang Tao, commander of the 89th Army, after they respectively issued telegrams announcing their uprisings. The exchange of telegrams is as follows:

(1) Uprising Telegram from General Wang Boxun, et al.:

To Commander Liu and Political Commissar Qiu in Chongqing, telegram to Chairman Mao in Beijing, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, and to all compatriots across the country:

Since the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang warmongers led by Chiang Kai-shek, such as Chen Cheng and Chen Lifu, with the aid of American imperialism, have betrayed their faith, torn it up with their own hands, and launched a large-scale civil war. Due to their corruption, autocracy, and selfishness, everything they did went against the interests of the people. Despite the help of American imperialism, they suffered repeated and惨败defeats. Afterwards, they fled abroad, and were denounced by the people of the whole country. Now that the country is about to be unified and the Central People's Government has been established, we can only repent of our past mistakes, turn to the people, and perform meritorious service to atone for our sins. Therefore, we have decided to announce our departure from the Kuomintang government in southwestern Guizhou today. From now on, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will realize the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and engage in the construction of a new China. We hope that all compatriots across the country will bear witness to this sincerity.

Wang Boxun, Deputy Commander of the 19th Army Corps, Wang Jingyuan, Commander of the 49th Army, Chen Yongsi, Commander of the 249th Division, Tan Benliang, Commander of the Southwestern Guizhou Pacification Zone, Yu Qiyou, Commander of the 272nd Division, Liu Heming, Commander of the Northwestern Guizhou Pacification Zone and Commander of the 271st Division, kowtow.

(2) Telegram Reply from Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping:

To the Guiyang Military Control Commission, forwarded to former Deputy Commander Wang Boxun, Commander Wang Jingyuan, Division Commander Chen Yongsi, Commander Tan Benliang, Division Commander Yu Qiyou, Commander and Division Commander Liu Heming:

Your telegram of December 10th is noted. We are greatly pleased that the Generals and others led their troops to resolutely rise up, break away from the reactionary Kuomintang government, turn to the people, and support the Common Program. Please immediately gather in the areas designated by Commander Yang and Political Commissar Su, and intensify revolutionary political education and political work to make yourselves conform to the standards of the People's Army, so as to facilitate reorganization into the People's Liberation Army on this basis.

(3) Uprising Telegram from General Zhang Tao, et al.:

To Commander Liu and Political Commissar Qiu in Chongqing, forwarded to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Beijing, and to all compatriots across the country and all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang:

As soldiers, since joining the National Revolutionary Army, through the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan, we have hoped for the independence, freedom, democracy, and happiness of our motherland. However, due to Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous dictatorship and poisoning of the people, he completely betrayed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles, forming a completely corrupt, selfish, shameless, and decadent reactionary group that exploited the vast masses of the country and enriched a few of the four major families. After the Japanese surrender, the whole country eagerly hoped for peace, but the reactionary elements headed by Chiang Kai-shek, with the aid of American imperialism, after repeatedly tearing up peace agreements, launched a large-scale counter-revolutionary war, carrying out inhumane destruction, causing incalculable losses to the country's manpower and resources. Thinking of this, we are filled with righteous indignation. Now we deeply feel that following Chiang Kai-shek only leads to death, and we will become enemies of history, unacceptable to the broad masses of the people. Now we have decided to resolutely break away from the Kuomintang reactionary group and turn to the people. We sincerely support the Central People's Government and the Common Program, resolutely implement Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Eight Points of Agreement and Generals Liu and Deng's Four Calls, and earnestly maintain local public order, maintain transportation, and guard state property. We earnestly hope that Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng will instruct us and educate us so that we can perform meritorious service to atone for our sins and serve the country and the people. We also hope that the remaining Kuomintang officers and soldiers will respond to our righteous actions, quickly break away from the Kuomintang remnants, return to the people, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, shoulder the responsibility of building a new China. With all sincerity, we respectfully ask for your consideration.

Zhang Tao, former Commander of the 89th Army of the Kuomintang Army, Chief of Staff Wang Dianze, Wei Xi, Commander of the 328th Division, Wang Jianwei, Deputy Division Commander, Xu Liu, Chief of Staff, Xiang @Hai, Commander of the 343rd Division, Tang Yunwu, Deputy Division Commander, Wang Ruojian, Chief of Staff, Cai Shikai, Huang Xiaosheng, Lai Chongen, Liu Zhongchang, Wen Yujun, Wu Ruzhou, Zhong Jian, regimental commanders, and all officers and soldiers, kowtow.

　　刘伯承司令员邓小平政委电复王伯勋张涛两将军
    勉加紧进行整训以便改编
    【新华社北京二十三日电】原国民党军十九兵团司令王伯勋及八十九军军长张涛两将军率部分别发出起义通电。人民解放军第二野战军刘伯承司令员、邓小平政委已予以电复。来往电文如下：
    　　　　（一）王伯勋将军等起义通电：
    重庆司令员刘、政治委员邱，电报北京主席毛、总司令朱、副总司令彭，并转全国同胞均鉴：
    慨自从政治协商会议以来，蒋介石为首的国民党好战分子陈诚、陈立夫之流，在美帝援助之下，竟背信弃义，一手将其撕毁，发动大规模的内战。由于他们的贪污腐败，独裁自私，一切违反人民利益，虽有美帝国主义帮助，终至一再惨败；之后逃亡国外，为全国人民所声讨。现在国内即将统一，中央人民政府已经成立，我们只有痛改前非，投向人民，立功赎罪。因此，我们决定于本日在黔西南宣布脱离国民党政府，今后决在毛主席的领导之下，实现人民政协共同纲领，从事于新中国的建设事业，希望全国同胞，共鉴斯心。
    十九兵团副司令王伯勋，四十九军军长王景渊，二四九师师长陈永思，贵州西南绥靖区司令谭本良，二七二师师长余启佑，贵州西北绥靖区司令兼二七一师师长刘鹤鸣同叩。亥灰印。
    　　　　（二）刘伯承、邓小平两将军复电：
    贵阳军管会转前王副总司令伯勋，王军长景渊，陈师长永思，谭司令本良，余师长启佑，刘师长兼司令鹤鸣诸将军勋鉴：
    十二月十日电悉。诸将军等率领所部，毅然起义，脱离国民党反动政府，归向人民，拥护共同纲领，实甚欣慰。尚请依照杨司令员、苏政治委员所指定的地区，即行集结，加紧进行革命的政治教育和政治工作，使自己符合于人民军队的标准，以便于在这样的基础上改编为人民解放军。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　刘伯承、邓小平
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十二月二十二日
    　　　　（三）张涛将军等起义通电：
    重庆刘司令员、邱政治委员转呈北京毛主席、朱总司令钧鉴，并转全国同胞暨国民党全体官兵均鉴：
    我们身为军人，自参加国民革命军，经过北伐与抗战，无非希望祖国获得独立、自由、民主、幸福，但由于蒋介石卖国独裁，荼毒人民，完全背叛孙中山先生的主张，形成全面贫污自私、无耻腐朽的反动集团，剥削了全国广大群众，肥壮了少数四大家族。当日寇投降后，举国上下殷望和平，而已蒋介石为首的反动分子在美帝援助之下，在其一再撕毁和平协议后，竟又发动了大规模的反革命战争，进行惨无人道的破坏，致使国家人力物力遭受了无法估计的损失，言念及此，义愤填膺。现在我们深切的感觉到，追随蒋介石只有死路一条，而且会成为历史敌人，为广大人民所不容。现在我们决定坚决脱离国民党反动集团，投向人民，我们竭诚拥护中央人民政府与共同纲领，坚决执行毛主席朱总司令约法八章与刘邓两将军的四项号召，并切实维持地方治安，维护交通，看管国家资财。我们殷切希望刘司令员、邓政治委员来指示我们，教育我们，使我们立功赎罪，为国家为人民服务。我们并希望残余的国民党官兵们响应我们的义举，迅速脱离国民党残余势力，归向人民，在毛主席领导之下来担起建设新中国的责任。耿耿此心，敬祈垂鉴。
    原国民党陆军第八十九军军长张涛，参谋长王典则，三二八师长魏锡，副师长王剑炜，参谋长徐镏三四三师长项＠还，副师长唐允武，参谋长王若坚，团长蔡世康、黄效升、赖崇恩、刘仲昌、闻羽军、吴汝舟、钟鉴，及全体官兵同叩。
    　　　　（四）刘伯承、邓小平两将军复电：
    贵阳军管会转八十九军张军长，王参谋长，魏师长，王副师长，徐参谋长，项师长，唐副师长，王参谋长暨全军官兵：
    来电悉。诸将军率领所部坚决脱离国民党蒋介石反动集团，归向人民，拥护中央人民政府，拥护共同纲领，并坚决执行毛主席朱总司令的约法八章，甚为欣慰。请即依照杨司令员、苏政治委员所指定的地区集结，加紧进行革命的政治教育和政治工作，使自己符合于人民军队的标准，以便于在这样的基础上改编为人民解放军。
