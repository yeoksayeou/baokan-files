　　Capital's Schools and Business Circles
　　Cheer the Meeting of the Two Great Leaders of China and the Soviet Union
    [Our Newspaper] The news of Chairman Mao's arrival in the Soviet capital to meet with Marshal Stalin has caused jubilation and excitement among schools and business circles in the capital. They believe this is a further development of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation and a symbol of the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the world's peaceful and democratic camp.
    On the 17th, just as Peking University faculty and students were celebrating the school anniversary and holding a representative meeting of teachers and students, the news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Moscow came. After the chairman of the meeting announced this news to everyone in an excited voice, the venue was immediately filled with storm-like applause, and the songs expressing cheers for the meeting of the world's two great people's leaders rose one after another!
    At the symposium held by the Peking University China-Soviet Friendship Association on the 21st to celebrate Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday, Professor Wang Tieyai emphasized: The meeting of the leaders of the people of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, and the two great revolutionaries of our time, fully proves that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is developing infinitely and also marks the great victory of the world's peaceful and democratic camp.
    Li Xishan, Director of the Mechanical Department of the Peking University Engineering College, and Zhao Zhengzhi, Professor of the Architecture Department, both expressed their feelings, saying that Chairman Mao met with Marshal Stalin and the leaders of various people's democratic countries during his visit to the Soviet Union, which shows the close unity of the people of the worldwide democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    He Yaokun, Chairman of the Student Union of the Engineering College, said: The upsurge of China's economic construction is coming soon with the assistance of Soviet friends. We must learn from the Soviet Union and study natural sciences from the perspective and methods of Marxism-Leninism.
    When the students of Jiaotong University heard the news that Chairman Mao had gone to Moscow to meet with the world's revolutionary leader Marshal Stalin, the entire school was completely immersed in a frenzy of cheers and excitement. The students of the dance group of the cultural troupe excitedly beat the victory drums on campus, and the student union broadcast the situation of Chairman Mao's arrival in Moscow and the warm welcome he received from international friends at the gates of various dormitories through loudspeakers. Everywhere in the school shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!", "Long live Chairman Mao!", "Long live Marshal Stalin!", and warm applause and songs rang like storms. The students unanimously recognized that Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union has played a great role in strengthening and consolidating the strength of the world's peaceful and democratic camp.
    The students of Normal University discussed the significance of Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union. Everyone agreed that Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union not only symbolizes that the Chinese people have stood up, but also marks that the Chinese people have firmly stood on the side of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and also shows that the world's democratic forces are growing stronger day by day.
    The Mongolian-Tibetan School held a symposium on the afternoon of the 26th, and the students' talks were filled with confidence and hope. Everyone believes that Chairman Mao's first trip abroad was to the Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country, which once again pointed out to the Chinese people that we must resolutely lean to one side, and also gave the imperialists a head-on blow. This will make the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples more consolidated and developed.
    People in the capital's business circles are very excited and often pay attention to the news about Chairman Mao in Moscow published in the newspapers. Fu Huating, manager of Beijing's only flour mill, believes that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union will be further strengthened as a result, and the world peace front will reach unprecedented consolidation and strength. Liu Yifeng, manager of Guoyao Industry, said: "This is an unprecedented development of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union." Sun Fuling, manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, and Tang Shaoyuan, manager of Daxihai Wine Company, both believe that Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union shows that the unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is further developing, and the new China under construction will receive more help from the socialist Soviet Union.
