　　Saved Eight Hundred Jin of Millet

　　The west side door of the hospital had been broken for a long time. Because everyone used the main entrance, few people ever noticed it, and even fewer thought about repairing it. Recently, a pack of stray dogs outside "took advantage of the breach" through this west side door and ran into the hospital to make trouble. They bit people everywhere during the day and fought at night, causing incessant noise. The nursing department submitted a request to the hospital's enterprise management committee to repair it. After detailed discussion at the hospital affairs meeting, the budget for making two new doors, the same as before with painted wooden boards and steel plates, required 1.8 million yuan. Although the hospital is now enterprise-managed, it must consider the burden on the majority of patients when charging fees, and its funding is only enough to be self-sufficient. Taking out this not-so-small sum at present is quite difficult, and the west side door is rarely used, so spending a lot of money to make this temporarily unused door is currently unnecessary. In the end, it was decided to fill it with yellow earth from the inside. But even so, the labor and hiring a cart would require 650,000 yuan.
　　Liu Dekuan is a worker in the west ward, and has been working in the hospital for three years. After the liberation of Beijing, he went through studies, his awareness gradually increased, he was very active in his work, and he studied with particular enthusiasm.
　　At noon on December 12th, he was returning from a political class in the front yard auditorium, and along the way he was thinking about the 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget he had just learned, just as Chairman Mao said: We have difficulties, we have solutions, and we have hope. We should help the government to solve the difficulties and restore our economy in three to five years.
　　He walked to the bulletin board and saw a group of people standing there, looking at some new notice. He ran to the front to take a look. It turned out to be the hospital affairs meeting's announcement regarding the decision to repair the west side door. Liu Dekuan thought: The national finances are currently so difficult, isn't it possible to find a way to save the money for blocking the door?
　　At six o'clock in the evening, everyone in the hospital got off work, but Liu Dekuan did not leave. He silently took a shovel and pushed the hospital's garbage cart to the back yard, to the Xian Nong Tan, to push earth towards the west side door. He pushed eight carts in two hours, piling them into a small heap. Liu Dekuan estimated that if he left two hours later every night and came two hours earlier every morning, plus one day of leave per week, he could block the broken door in about a month, saving the hospital this money.
　　Very early the next morning, Liu Dekuan came again and pushed another four carts of earth. He then went to the enterprise management committee to discuss this plan with Wu Yanling, and requested to be given this task.
　　The "Quick Report" was immediately posted, praising Liu Dekuan and issuing a call to all the workers in the hospital, which immediately received the response of twelve workers from the entire hospital. In addition, two staff members from the general affairs department, two male nurses from the nursing department, and three female nurses also eagerly signed up to participate. On the spot, everyone unanimously decided that, starting that day, everyone would work overtime for two hours after getting off work at six o'clock every night to quickly complete this task.
　　In winter, the days are short. At six o'clock it is already very dark. The northwest wind blows, causing the power lines to whirr, "We workers have strength... Hey!..." Sturdy singing constantly came from inside the west side door. In addition to the hospital's original two garbage carts, two more were borrowed from the North Hospital's Maternal and Child Health Institute; even the four coal-carrying large shoulder baskets, shovels, and coal shovels from the kitchen were borrowed. Under a temporary electric light, led by Wu Yanling, a competition to strive to be a "soil-filling model" unfolded. En Changhai pushed six carts per hour, surpassing Liu Dekuan's record of five carts. No one wanted to be outdone. Nurses Huang Quan and Zhang Jiaqi persisted in carrying eight baskets of soil per hour even though they had large purple blisters on their shoulders. Hui Baoquan tripped over a stone, and his hand was scratched by a nail on the cart. He got up by himself, shook the mud off his clothes, and continued to push the soil. Everyone wanted him to go back to the ward quickly to bandage his hand, so as not to freeze the wound. He said, "What's this?" and assured everyone that he would not go home in the evening without pushing twelve carts of soil. In the end, Liu Dekuan won the "soil-filling model" with the highest record of pushing eight carts per hour.
　　A soil mountain as high as the walls on both sides was piled up in this way. Under Liu Dekuan's leadership and everyone's efforts, the hospital and the country saved 650,000 yuan, equivalent to eight hundred jin of millet.
　　December 20, Xian Nong Tan Tuberculosis Hospital.

　　节约了八百斤小米
    严言
    医院里的西便门坏了很久了，因为大家出入都走正大门，所以从来就很少有人注意到；也更很少有人想到修理它。近来外面一群野狗，便由这西便门“乘破而入”，跑进医院里来捣乱；白天到处咬人，夜里打架，吵闹不堪。护理部便向医院里的企业化管理委员会提出，请求修理。经过院务会议详细讨论，预算重做两扇和从前一样油漆木板夹钢板的新大门，须要一百八十万块钱。现在医院虽然是企业化，可是在收费要顾及到大多数病人的负担，经费仅能自给自足。目前拿出这一笔并不算小的数目也是相当困难，而且西便门向来不使用，花很多钱做这暂不使用的门，目前实无必要。最后决定改用黄土由里面填死。但就是这样，连人工带雇车也须要六十五万块钱。
    刘德宽是西病房的工友，在医院里工作已经三年了，北京解放后，他经过了学习，觉悟渐渐提高，工作很积极，学习也特别起劲。
    十二月十二日中午，他正由前院大礼堂上政治课回来，一路上正想着方才所学的一九五零年全国财政收支概算，正如毛主席所说：我们是有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。我们应该帮助政府，解决困难，使我们的经济，在三五年内恢复起来。
    他走到揭示牌前，看见站着一堆人，在瞧着一张什么新的告示，他便跑到前面一看，原来是院务会议公布关于修理西便门的决议。刘德宽便想：目前国家财政这样困难，堵门的钱，不是可以想法节约吗？
    晚上六点钟，医院里同人都下班了，刘德宽没有走。他不声不响的自己拿了一把铁锹，推着医院推垃圾的小车，去后院先农坛里往西便门推土。两个钟头推了八车，堆成一小堆。刘德宽一估量，若是每天晚上晚走两点钟，早晨再早来两点钟，再加每星期一个体假，这样约摸一个月工夫，一个人就能把这破门堵好，可以给医院省下这笔钱。
    第二天早晨很早很早刘德宽就来了，又推了四车土，就到企业化管理委员会去，把这个计划和乌延龄商量；并请求答应给他这一任务。
    “快报”马上贴出来了，表扬了刘德宽，并对全院工友发出号召，立刻得到全院十二名工友的响应。并且事务部两个职员，护理部两位男护士和三位女护士，也都踊跃的来报名参加。当场全体一致决定，从当天起每天晚上六点钟下班以后，全体再加班两点钟，赶快完成这一任务。
    冬天，白日是短的，六点钟天已经很黑了，西北风吹得电线飕飕地响，“咱们工人有力量……嘿！……”西便门里不断的传出来雄壮的歌声。除了医院里原有的两部推垃圾的小车外，又由北院妇婴保健所借到两部；连厨房里的四个装煤的大抬筐、铁锹、煤铲都借来了。就这样的在一盏临时拉起的电灯下面，由乌延龄领导着，展开了争取“填土模范”的竞赛。恩长海每小时推六车，追过了刘德宽五车的纪录。大家谁也不甘示弱，护士黄泉和张家骐肩头磨了个大紫泡还坚持每小时抬八筐土。惠宝泉被石头绊倒了，手也被车上的钉子挂破了。自己爬起来，抖抖衣服上的泥，仍旧继续推着土。大家都要他赶快回病房去，把手包起来，免得冻了伤口。他说：“这一点算个啥？”并且向大家保证不推完十二军土，晚上不回家。最后还是刘德宽以每小时推八车的最高纪录，争得了“填土模范”。
    一座和两边墙头一齐高的土山，就这样的被堆集起来了。在刘德宽的带头和大家的努力下，给医院、给国家省下了六十五万块钱，合八百斤小米。
    十二，二十，先农坛结核病院。
