The following article is a speech given by Comrade Dubrovinina at a symposium held in Shenyang by people from all walks of life to bid farewell to the Soviet cultural delegation. It provides a detailed account of Soviet education work and is reprinted here as a reference for our country's educational reform efforts.

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor

Since the success of the Soviet Revolution, thirty-two long years have passed in the work of national construction. At today's symposium, some comrades suggested that I briefly discuss the process of educational reform in the Soviet Union after the revolution, including how to reform old intellectuals and how to reform the curriculum. I am now prepared to combine these issues and talk to you about them.

Comrades! We must first understand that after the success of the Soviet Revolution, the Soviet Union was unable to draw on the experience of other countries in terms of educational reform because the Soviet social system was the first of its kind in the world. In the Soviet Union's educational reform efforts at that time, we did not have any experience to refer to, so we made mistakes and had many inappropriate aspects in our work. After discovering these, we slowly corrected them. However, after the success of the Chinese Revolution this time, there is Soviet experience to refer to. We hope that the mistakes that occurred in the Soviet Union in the past will not be repeated in China's educational reform. We believe that the path taken by Chinese cultural and educational workers will definitely be shorter and will definitely not be as long as the one initially taken by the Soviet Union, and they will not make the mistakes that the Soviet Union made in the past. There is no need to repeat them in China."

After the success of the October Revolution, we specifically promulgated a number of orders on how to reform old education, how to reform the old school system, and the old curriculum. In terms of school education, we announced a new principle that was completely different from the old education system. Before the revolution, during the Tsarist Russian era, they established different schools and curricula for different classes. However, after the Soviet Revolution, we stipulated a unified school system and unified methods. Everyone has the right to receive education, and there is absolutely no class distinction like in the Tsarist Russian era. Before the revolution, many children could not receive education, and they could not go to school. At that time, very few so-called school-age children were able to attend school, totaling about eight million. But we stipulated that regardless of whether children are male or female, as long as they have reached school age, they must attend school. To date, the Soviet Union has 34 million children in school, which means that all children are able to attend school. Before the revolution, primary and secondary schools charged tuition fees, and because the tuition fees were very high, many children of working people could not attend school. After the revolution, these schools were free, and all children of working people were able to attend school. All school expenses are paid by the state, and this budget increases year by year. Now, the education expenditure of our Russian Socialist Republic accounts for almost three-quarters of the entire budget. Before the revolution, religious courses were taught in schools, and many schools taught Bible classes. After the revolution, the church and the school were fundamentally separated. Now, Soviet schools are non-religious schools, and they try their best to explain social development and natural phenomena with Marxist-Leninist scientific thought, removing mystical or religious claims. In the Soviet Union, it is free to believe in religion, but in schools, no curriculum can be explained with religion. We and you all understand that science and religion and superstition are irreconcilable. What I just spoke about was the situation of the Tsarist Russian nation before the revolution, and the situation of other nations was even worse. They had no writing system of their own, no culture of their own, and could not use their own writing system to study and read. However, after the success of the Soviet Revolution, it was announced that all nations have the right to study and receive education in their own national language. From elementary school to higher education, they all use their own language, regardless of which nation they belong to, they completely use their own language to teach. In the Tsarist Russian era, education was a tool for the ruling class to oppress the ruled class. It used school education to create the ideal of people oppressing people. However, after the success of the Soviet Revolution, our school is also a tool - a tool to educate and transform the people, so that they can have new understanding, understand Marxism-Leninism, and become the builders of the new socialist future. In the orders promulgated after the success of the revolution, it was clearly pointed out that we must fundamentally transform the content of the curriculum, as well as textbooks and settings. At that time, this work was very arduous.

The following discusses the issue of adult education.

    I. Adult Education

After the revolution, in 1919, based on Comrade Lenin's proposal, an order was issued: to eliminate all illiteracy, stipulating that all people between the ages of eight and fifty must learn to read and write. After the revolution, because new construction was about to begin, all departments needed new talents, so training classes were opened on a large scale at that time. Some of these training classes were longer in duration, and some were shorter, but the content was very rich and was organized by category. Training classes were held in factories, institutions, and schools, with the aim of enabling illiterate people to become literate, people who were already literate to improve their cultural level, or literate people who did not understand specialized science to enter technical training classes. At the same time, through various training classes, old intellectuals were transformed. In addition, in order to select outstanding elements from workers and peasants to further improve their cultural level, workers' universities were established in the early days after the revolution. The task of these workers' universities was to train new intellectuals from among the workers and peasants. For this purpose, we established workers' universities. Workers' universities absorb all workers and peasants, regardless of what education they have received. We know that in the Tsarist Russian era, very few workers were able to receive secondary education, and most had very little primary education. But we cannot abandon them. We must educate them so that they can become our new intellectuals. The intellectuals we need must be drawn from the workers and peasants, and when we initially selected them, we paid close attention to class background. We had to select them from the workers and peasants. These workers' universities were sometimes affiliated with universities, and the people who taught them were university professors or experts, so that after they graduated, they could go to vocational schools or universities to study. Because the working class and peasants in the past had no opportunity to receive education and were engaged in very arduous labor, they felt it was indeed difficult when they first started learning. For example, many workers appeared clumsy because they had been engaged in labor for many years and could not even hold a pen. Older workers even cried when they read. Although they felt it was difficult and although they shed tears, they still studied resolutely, not only during the day but also at night, almost forgetting to rest. They tried their best to learn in order to grasp new scientific knowledge. They felt a lot of difficulty and inconvenience in their first year of enrollment, it was easier in the second year, and it was much better in the third year. When they graduated in the fourth and fifth years, they had a wealth of knowledge and could go to university or vocational school. This measure, this method, was a method used in the early days after the success of our revolution.

In terms of organization and methods of eliminating illiteracy, we have done a great deal of work. This work was very arduous, because in the Tsarist Russian era, illiteracy accounted for 80 percent of the national population. This number is very large, and it is not easy to eliminate illiteracy all at once. It is an arduous and demanding task. Therefore, a special commission for eliminating illiteracy was established under the government, specifically responsible for the work of eliminating illiteracy, responsible for organization and specific implementation. Under the leadership of the special commission and the People's Ministry of Education, all staff members of various agencies were organized to participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy. All staff members in factories, schools, and institutions who could read and write participated in this work. "Everyone who is literate must teach one illiterate person" was an important slogan at the time. After the work of eliminating illiteracy began, many elementary textbooks were published. These textbooks could be seen in factories, institutions, and schools, and many people or classes were studying, or studying alone. The process of eliminating illiteracy was quite long, taking almost twenty years. By 1940, the government announced that 50 million illiterate people had been eliminated, and illiteracy had been completely eliminated in the Soviet Union. They can develop their talents in all aspects. This is a simple process of adult education.

The workers' universities that I just mentioned were established temporarily because workers and peasants previously had no opportunity to receive education, and it was necessary to provide them with education immediately. Later, because the education system had been regularized and normalized, it was no longer the same as the transformation period in the past. Young people and children can all enroll in school, especially the children of workers and peasants. They can not only receive secondary education but also go to universities or vocational schools. Therefore, there is no longer any need to run such workers' universities, and they have now all been canceled. Although we have canceled workers' universities, there is still a form of adult education in the Soviet Union. This is the urban youth schools and rural youth schools that are now established. Urban youth schools are for workers, and rural youth schools are for farmers. The students of the former workers' universities were separated from production, but those who enter these two types of schools are not separated from production. They work during the day and study at night, with four evenings of classes a week, and the rest of the time they study on their own at home. These two types of schools are regular schools, and the curriculum is the same as that of ordinary secondary schools. Young workers and peasants also receive diplomas after graduating, and they can also go to universities or vocational schools. This is where it differs from the previous workers' universities.

After the first stage of adult education passed, at the beginning of the new stage, Comrade Stalin put forward another slogan, another task, which was to further improve the cultural level of workers and peasants, and to raise the cultural and scientific level of workers and peasants to the level of scientists and technical experts. All Soviet industrial colleges are now established to specifically admit workers and peasants who have graduated from the original workers' universities and the remedial schools mentioned earlier. They can enter these colleges to continue their studies and become scientific and technical personnel with specialized knowledge. After graduating, they can become technical experts or leading cadres in enterprise management. In addition, we have another principle, which is to enable workers and peasants to have a certain degree of scientific cultivation, so that they can establish contact with and have opportunities for friendly cooperation with the original scientific workers and technicians. Now in the Soviet Union, no scientist, no matter how great his cultivation, can be separated from the broad masses like in the past. He must be connected with the broad masses of knowledgeable people. For example, the famous Soviet scientist Lysenko, who is the inheritor and promoter of Michurin's theory. That is how he is. Lysenko is an agricultural expert, and his experimental work is not entirely carried out in his chemical laboratory, but also requires contact with the broad masses of peasants, and his work relies on the broad masses of peasants. For example, he has now invented a new wheat seed. The original wheat grows one ear, but after his research, he invented a new wheat that grows seven or eight ears like a tree＠, and the harvest is eight times more than before. His experiments are not only carried out in the laboratory, but also promoted and implemented in various collective farms. All scientists have close ties with workers and peasants. Therefore, in terms of invention and scientific research, it is not only scientists who are doing it there, but also the workers and peasants themselves. Now, many workers and peasants also have many creations and inventions. Many people have received Stalin Prizes. In addition to the methods I just mentioned, there is also a more detailed and specific method to improve workers' cultural standards in political and scientific aspects, which is the widespread establishment of libraries, exhibition halls, and various training classes to improve the cultural standards of workers and peasants. At the same time, the "Association for the Promotion of Scientific Knowledge" has recently been established, inviting many famous scientists and scholars to give reports and speeches to disseminate scientific knowledge. Any worker, peasant, or intellectual can participate in the lectures. Not only in famous big cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, but also in small towns and collective farms, these lectures and reports are held, with the aim of widely popularizing scientific knowledge. This is not only to improve the level of workers and peasants in political and production aspects, but also to improve them in literature and art, and to select talents from among them. For example, in factories and enterprises, art, dance, and literature are also promoted, and many symposiums are held. Workers and peasants in amateur theater groups or amateur music groups all have the opportunity to develop. Those with talent can be selected and trained to become artists, musicians, dancers, or artists. What I have said above is the working process of adult education implemented in the Soviet Union after the revolution. At first, it was to eliminate illiteracy, then it was to enroll in school and study, and then it was not only to eliminate illiteracy, but also to further improve cultural and scientific knowledge. Now it is to develop the talents of workers and peasants in all aspects. This is the process of adult education in the Soviet Union.

    II. Transformation of Primary and Secondary Education

Now I will begin to talk about the transformation of primary and secondary education in the Soviet Union, and I will also talk about the mistakes we made and the detours we took in the work process. We hope that China will avoid the mistakes we made and the detours we took in this work in the future.

The first stage was after the success of the Soviet Revolution, when it began to negate the old, destroy the old, and build the new. The construction of the new was carried out in accordance with the orders promulgated and the methods announced by the government. The most important thing in this stage was to develop the number of schools, that is, to establish as many schools as possible. Of course, schools were mainly run by the state. In addition, all institutions and enterprises were engaged in this work, helping to run as many schools as possible.

At the same time, in this stage, the political orientation of all schools was determined, which was to train new cadres and transform old intellectuals.

In the work process, we have fought (if this word can be used). This is that we must fight against both right-leaning and left-leaning tendencies. What is the situation of so-called right-leaning opportunism? That is, to try to maintain the original schools and old teaching methods, so we must wage a resolute struggle against this right-leaning opportunism. We not only have to fight against right-leaning opportunism, but also against left-leaning childish tendencies. Now I will talk about the source of left-leaning childish tendencies. How does the danger of so-called left-leaning childishness come about? This originates from a false scientific view, or a false scientific view. At that time, there was a kind of bourgeois education implementation in the United States, which was a very dangerous idea. At that time, it mostly penetrated into our education work through this American science, fake science. To point it out specifically, the "Dalton" system is an example. Their slogan is not that school educates us, but that life educates us, which means negating the role of the school, and schools are not necessary. This is anti-Leninist thinking, and it is also anti-scientific thinking, because according to their claims, schools can be cancelled, schools are not necessary, there is no need to manage schools, and there is no need to build schools. This kind of thinking is very harmful. Why? If it is said that life can educate us, then the role of the school is reduced, and students think that since life can educate us, teachers are not necessary, so teachers, schools, and teaching methods cannot be developed. The Soviet Communist Party corrected this error, corrected this deviation, and corrected right-leaning opportunism and left-leaning childish thinking. After correcting the errors, a correct education system was determined.

The process of national education in the Soviet Union can probably be divided into two stages. One period was to call on everyone to receive education, and after a certain period of time, compulsory education was implemented. Not only do people have the right to receive education, but they must also be forced to receive education. In 1930, the state issued an order to implement compulsory education, that is, everyone must receive education. According to this order, a four-year compulsory education system was implemented in rural areas. Everyone must receive four years of primary school education, and in cities and workers' residential areas, a seven-year compulsory education system was implemented, and everyone must receive seven years of school education. In the second stage, that is, this year, 1949, another regulation was made, which is that seven-year school education is not only necessary and compulsory in cities, but also in rural areas. Rural areas are not limited to four-year primary schools, but must also enter seven-year schools. This means that not only in cities, but also in rural areas, seven-year compulsory education must be universally implemented from today onwards. In addition, in the next few years, a task must be completed, which is that in addition to seven-year schools, ten-year schools must also be made compulsory education. Not only in the Soviet Union itself, but also in every republic, ten-year compulsory education must be implemented, and everyone must receive ten years of education.

To return to the curriculum content and deny this right-leaning opportunist thinking and left-leaning harmful thinking, in this aspect, a formal order was promulgated in 1931. The government made a very strict summary and criticism of the work results of the school in the past fourteen years, pointing out that the school work had considerable achievements, and at the same time especially pointed out a shortcoming, that is, the curriculum content did not enable each student to obtain basic scientific knowledge. This was a shortcoming of past school education. The Party Central Committee especially emphasized that the school curriculum content must stipulate that each student must be able to master basic scientific knowledge. Of course, this scientific knowledge is progressive, scientific, and is the Marxist-Leninist materialist science. After the issuance of this order, the Party Central Committee issued many other specific measures in response to this shortcoming, refuting the erroneous educational methods transmitted from the United States. This harmful idea transmitted from the United States believes that children's education does not need to go through school, and teachers are not necessary. Experts should be used. Experts have rich knowledge, understand children's psychology, and understand children's habits. They should be used to specially educate children. This means that in addition to teachers, there must also be an expert. This expert tests students and comes up with many difficult problems that not only primary school students cannot solve, but even adults cannot solve. If students cannot solve them, it is considered that the students' intelligence is not enough, and they cannot study in this school. They must be sent to another school specially set up for children with low intelligence. This kind of thinking is very harmful and very wrong, because children's intelligence is not necessarily bad. It is only because the questions are too difficult, and the children cannot solve them, so it is considered that the students' intelligence is backward, and they must be sent to another school. This is deliberately hindering the development of children. The Party Central Committee discovered this error and corrected it in time, ordering the cancellation of this method. The school must have teachers to teach and use all methods to guide students. The Party Central Committee decided to find the children who were originally considered to have poor intelligence and sent away and return them to their original schools. It was subsequently discovered that these students' intelligence was not backward and was the same as other children. Our teachers unanimously recognized that there is no major difference in children's intelligence, except for a few. The main thing is the issue of the quality of teaching methods. If the teaching is good, every child can accept it and develop his or her intelligence.

What I just spoke about were the mistakes made in the transformation process of Soviet education. It is hoped that other countries (new democratic countries), especially China, will not make this mistake again. There is also a source of this harmful thought in China. This is that there is still a remnant force of American educational thought in China, and it is inevitable that it is still retained in thinking. Everyone must be vigilant about this and try to avoid making this mistake again.

At the same time, one more thing to mention is that after the revolution in the Soviet Union, on the one hand, it was necessary to negate the old, and on the other hand, it was necessary to build the new. But there were some good things in the old that we also cancelled. Later, after the Party Central Committee corrected it, it retained the good things in the old that were worth learning from and worth applying. Therefore, there are also old things in the new, but these old things are good, and these old things are beneficial to us.

The CPC Central Committee particularly emphasized that the school curriculum is the most important and must not be taken lightly. It must also be pointed out that teachers should be responsible for students' learning of various knowledge. After the end of the semester, the grades of each student must be tested. There are also regulations on students' academic performance and conduct. For example, the phenomenon of laxity must be eliminated. In elementary schools, teachers must stand up when they come to the classroom, and they can only sit down after the teacher reaches the podium. This is a basic discipline. In addition, there are many new and strict regulations on teaching methods. What I have said above are the regulations of the government and the Party on school discipline, curriculum, teaching methods, and learning methods.

In addition, the curriculum should be linked before and after. Whether it is literature or geography, it is continuous. What is said this year will continue to be said next year. The courses taught this year and next year are connected before and after. And attention should be paid to students' ability to accept. Only what is accepted and understood by students can be included in the curriculum. Courses that cannot be understood and accepted by students will not be included.

One more point is that the development status of the natural world and the development status of human society must be explained from a materialist point of view; any idealist point of view must be avoided. And we determine that the school has Party spirit, and the teaching method also has Party spirit. Because we want to implement our teaching method under the policies of the Party, our teaching method is a teaching method with Party spirit. There is an erroneous idea that learning can be separated from politics, that is, the school curriculum can be separated from politics. It seems that geography, literature, and these things have nothing to do with politics, as if any country and any place are the same. This idea is wrong. There is also an erroneous idea that all subjects can be completely kept as they are, except for adding a political course separately. This idea is also wrong. We must know that the school and politics cannot be separated, and the school is precisely a tool of politics, so their relationship is very close and must not be separated. The problem is not that adding a political subject to the curriculum is the end of the matter. Of course, it is right for us to add a political subject, but political content should be added to each subject, and new content should be added from a political point of view. Now I would like to give a few specific examples:

For example, let's take the geography class we are teaching now. We have read the geography textbooks of every country, and there are maps in the textbooks. What was the situation of the geography textbooks in Germany during the Soviet-German War during the anti-Soviet war? The eastern border of the German geography textbook was almost to the Soviet Ural Mountains, and the Japanese geography said that its western border also reached the Soviet Ural Mountains. That is to say, the national borders of the two countries have reached the Ural Mountains. For example, let's take a look at the map of Japan now. Maybe there is no word "Northeast", but the word "Manchukuo". So we have to ask whether their geography is the same as ours? Our geography changes according to world changes and political changes. The geography teachers in the Soviet Union are very happy. At the beginning of the last semester, when they talked about Chinese geography, it was when the Chinese people liberated a part of North China, but by the end of the semester, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou were all liberated, and Chinese geography changed according to the political situation. Now we should make a new map of China, and the color on the new map of China is no longer the color of Japanese imperialism and Anglo-American imperialists, but the color of Chinese red.

Let's take a history class as an example. At first glance, it seems that the history of any country is the same and there is no difference. In fact, it is not like that. Let's take a look at how the UK and the US study Chinese history. They regard Chinese history as the history of the development of their colonies, the history of colonial slaves. They themselves say: "They have made great contributions to China and brought a high degree of civilization to China." But how do we, the Soviet people, view Chinese history with the Chinese people? We regard Chinese history as the history of the Chinese people's liberation movement. At the same time, according to the development of this history, the Chinese people have driven away the people who brought "civilization" to China and sent them back to their own country. Before we left Beijing, we went to see Chairman Mao. He told us about the liberation of the Chinese people: At first, when the Kuomintang ruling group drove us away and chased us, it was like driving ducks. Not only did they deprive us of freedom of speech, freedom of publication, and other freedoms, but they even did not allow us to walk on this land. They only gave us a very small room, and this room was called a prison. Because we were not allowed to walk on the ground at that time, we had no choice but to go to a very small place in the north, but this is the history of the past. Now a new history has unfolded a new page, which means that we now drive them away as if we are driving ducks. We can now freely walk back and forth on the land of China and build our new society and new life. This is a kind of Party spirit of history. Anglo-American imperialists still do not recognize the People's Republic of China, but the Soviet Union was the first to recognize it! And we attach great importance to this history. When we educate our children in the future, let them read and protect this great history very seriously! Therefore, our curriculum cannot always be the same old thing. We must design our curriculum according to the new history and new life. According to this principle, we have done a lot of work in textbooks and adapted new textbooks, but this work is very arduous and cannot be completed in a few days. So far, our textbooks can be regarded as standard textbooks, and we can use these textbooks for a considerable amount of time.

At the same time, we have also reformed our teaching methods. The old teaching methods are limited to four points: teachers, blackboards, chalk, and books are enough. But now these four points are not enough. At the same time, in the past, children only read and memorized by rote, but in Soviet schools, a new teaching method has been re-stipulated.

First, a lot of reference work should be done, so that students can make various forms in terms of charts and drawings, so that they can personally do some work in this area in addition to books. If it is just a very dull book with no pictures or charts, children will not be interested in reading. If we provide him with many charts and drawings, the children's interest in reading will be improved.

Second, we should pay attention to experimental work and practical work. We must enable students to watch the charts themselves and do physical and chemical experiments themselves.

The school must have a laboratory, and in addition, a campus, vegetable garden, and small-scale farm should be built near the school. In short, there must be a piece of land for students to practice in person. Near Moscow there is a school where the famous Soviet heroine Dan Niang studied. When I went to this school before, it was still very desolate. I have been there again recently, and the situation is different. It is covered with flowers and fruit trees, all for students to practice. In addition, there is another school in Moscow with 500 kinds of plants in its nearby school field farm. These seeds are all taken from the laboratories of senior schools and planted by students themselves.

Third, the transformation work of intellectuals and cadres

Regarding the transformation and education of intellectuals and cadres in the Soviet Union, we should be very frank and say that the transformation of intellectuals in the Soviet Union was not completed in a day or two. This kind of transformation work is very arduous and requires a considerable amount of time. In the early days of the revolution, there were even education workers who went on strike. Teachers refused to go to new schools to teach. At that time, it was very difficult. At that time, we only relied on progressive elements among education workers to carry out work, and at the same time waged a resolute struggle against our enemies and defeated strikes. At the same time, we must have great patience to transform the broad masses of intellectuals in education. Some intellectuals do not understand the tasks of the revolution and do not have enough understanding of the revolution. Because at that time, some intellectuals believed that the working class may not be able to understand theory, accept culture, and develop culture.

They believe that only they themselves have profound knowledge and high learning, but they do not understand that in the past they only served the bourgeoisie. They did not realize their past mistakes. They did not understand that at that time there were two kinds of thoughts: one kind of thought was the bourgeois thought, and the other kind of thought was the proletarian thought, the progressive new thought. They did not distinguish them, nor did they understand this point: that bourgeois thought, which had played a progressive role, has now declined with the decline of bourgeois society. They do not understand that now bourgeois thought is no longer a progressive thought, not a new thought, not a forward-looking thought. Now bourgeois thought is already a declining and reactionary thought. What they advocate is racial discrimination and national oppression. They want a few imperialists to rule the world. They are creating wars there. This is the bourgeois thought now. On the other hand, socialist thought is not like this. This kind of socialist thought is to promote mutual friendship between nations, strive for democracy, and strive for peace. This is a progressive thought. This means that their education and our education, their science and our science, are fundamentally two different things in principle.

For example, let's take physics. In the United States, they once invented the atomic bomb, but they were unwilling to make this secret public to us until recently. Why do they want to keep this secret from us? They want to use this atomic bomb to maintain their rule over the world. They want to use the atomic bomb to launch a new war and harm the elderly and young people. Although they are unwilling to make the secret of the atomic nucleus public to us, our Soviet scholars, without them, have also invented this method of splitting the atomic nucleus. We have invented the splitting of the atomic nucleus, and we are determined to use atomic energy, but we do not use it in war like them. Our purpose is to use it for peaceful purposes. We use atomic energy to change the world and improve people's lives.

So there are two paths in front of us: one is the route of bourgeois decay, preparing to create wars and preparing to harm mankind. We also have another route, which is to strive for peace, oppose war, and seek welfare for the people. So far, there is no third way. If someone hesitates between these two paths, he may fall into the most reactionary bourgeois path. Therefore, when we transform intellectuals, we have said, which path do you want to take? You have to think about it and choose which path to take, the declining and corrupt bourgeois path, or the path of new life? What we are fighting for is not yesterday, but the happiness of mankind tomorrow. This aspect of work is very arduous and difficult. We have held many meetings, such as seminars, on how to make intellectuals learn, so that they can further study and make progress. The effort spent in this aspect is very great. We have mobilized all teachers to participate in how to transform our schools and how to transform our teaching methods on their own initiative. We have used great patience to expose and refute reactionary ideas. If these transformed intellectuals make mistakes today, we use great patience to explain to them the mistakes they have made. We have used the Bolshevik method of criticism very well. We have done self-criticism and mutual criticism. The method of criticism has had a great effect. We want every intellectual to understand the policies of our government and the Party. Now, every cultural worker in the Soviet Union remembers what Comrade Stalin said at the Eighteenth Party Congress. He said: "There is no need to make medical experts also physicists or botanists; conversely, there is no need to make the latter also the former. But there is a scientific department that all Bolsheviks in all scientific departments must know, and that is Marxism-Leninism about society, about the laws of social development, about the laws of the development of the proletarian revolution, about the laws of the development of the cause of socialist construction, and about the science of the victory of communism." We have paid a lot of patience and a lot of energy for this transformation work, but so far, we can say that our Soviet intellectuals have been completely able to achieve a unified thought in terms of so-called political morality, that is, they can serve the Soviet people, and their thoughts have been communicated with the workers and peasants. In the Soviet Union, any labor is respected, and the work of national teachers is also one of the most respected labors. In the Soviet Union, the remuneration for being a teacher is very high. If you have been engaged in education work for a long time, very old, and should retire, you can get a pension from the government. The amount of these pensions is 40% of your salary. Teachers can get medals or decorations as long as they do a good job. Teachers can also be selected to work in government agencies, from the Supreme Soviet to the local Soviet. They can all be elected to be representatives, because the government and the Party care about the teachers, so the education workers in the Soviet Union love the Party and the government very much.

    IV. Impressions of Chinese Education Work

Finally, as I conclude this report, I would like to say a few words: A comrade asked me to talk about our impressions of Chinese schools after we came to China this time. Now I would like to talk about it. Because I have not visited many schools in China this time, I have only visited a few schools, so I cannot talk about the entire situation in China. But now I can talk about the most important impression I have received. This impression is a good aspect. When I met Chinese primary school students and Chinese teachers, what I felt was: (1) I felt that the organizational power was very strong, and the discipline was also very strict. (2) I felt that the students' desire for knowledge was very strong and very high. No matter which classroom I went to, no matter what kind of subject I saw, I found that the students' attention was very strong, and they all paid attention to listening to the lecture, and could get richer and more complete knowledge from the teachers.

In addition, I felt that the revolution being carried out in China now has a very obvious reaction to them. We saw that political classes have already started in every classroom, and education work is already being carried out for students in the political aspect. Even very young primary school students are also reading materials that have a correct understanding of the revolution. When I walked into a second-grade classroom, I saw that the teacher was telling them how Chairman Mao went to comfort a wounded soldier. What the students heard was: This wounded soldier was very willing to see Chairman Mao before he died. But Chairman Mao was very far away from the wounded soldier's place, but he still rode a horse to this place, and could still have time to see the wounded soldier. This wounded soldier said the final farewell words to Chairman Mao. This wounded soldier sacrificed his life entirely for the cause of Chinese people's liberation, for the happiness of the people, and for a free new China. This wounded soldier said to Chairman Mao before he died: "I am not afraid of death, because I sacrificed for the cause of the people. Now that I can see you, how glorious I am." When I visited this class, I saw a girl shedding tears after listening to it. It may be that this girl thought of his father and the father who sacrificed for the cause of the people. At the same time, I saw that many of the children were very heavy-faced. I believe that when these children grow up in the future, they will be able to continue to complete their great cause of rejuvenation.

At the same time, I also saw a school where Russian classes were being taught. In Chinese schools, Russian classes are being actively studied. I walked into a classroom where Russian was being taught, and I asked the Russian teacher to let me teach, so I went to class. He happened to be talking about the word "student", so I wrote that the students of the Soviet Union pay their respects to you. After learning, they can all understand and read it. I wrote "Representatives of Soviet students pay

　　苏联的教育工作
    此文系杜伯洛维娜同志在沈阳各界欢送苏联文化代表团教育座谈会上的讲话。对苏联教育工作叙述颇详，特转载于此，以为我国教育改造工作的借鉴。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    自苏联革命成功到现在，在国家建设工作方面已经走了三十二年的悠长的路程。在今天这个座谈会上，有的同志曾向我提出一个意见，就是希望我在这个报告中，简单的讲讲苏联革命后改造教育的过程，其中包括如何改造旧知识分子，如何改造课程等问题。现在我准备把这些问题综合在一起，向各位同志来讲一讲。
    同志们！我们首先要了解苏联在革命成功之后，在教育改造方面并没有能够从其他国家取得经验，因为苏联的社会制度是世界上第一个出现的。当时苏联改革教育的工作中，因为我们没有任何经验可以参考，所以我们曾经犯过错误，在工作方面有许多不合适的地方，经发现后，我们才慢慢改掉。但是，这次中国革命成功以后，有苏联经验可以参考，苏联过去所发生的一些错误，希望在中国教育改造中不要重犯。我们相信中国的文化教育者所走的路程一定短，一定不会象苏联当初走的那样远，不会象苏联过去那样犯错误。在中国这方面，没有什么必要再犯了。”
    在十月革命成功以后，我们专门为如何改造旧教育、如何改造旧学制和旧课程颁布了一些命令，在学校教育方面，我们宣布了一种新原则，这种新原则和旧教育制度绝不相同。革命前帝俄时代他们为不同的阶级设立不同的学校与学习课程，但是，苏联革命后，我们规定了统一的一种学制，统一的办法，每一个人都有受教育的权利，绝对没有了帝俄时代的那种阶级区别的现象。在革命之前有很多小孩子不能受教育，他们更不能到学校里去。那时候所谓学龄儿童能够入学的很少，一共约有八百万。而我们就规定不管是男女儿童只要已经达到入学年龄，他就得一定入学。到现在为止，苏联入学儿童已有三千四百万，就是说全部儿童都能够入学了。在革命以前，中小学校都收学费，因为学费很高，有很多劳动人民的子女都不能入学。革命以后这些学校都免费，所有劳动人民子女都能够入学了。所有学校经费，都由国家来支出，这预算一年比一年增加。现在我们俄罗斯社会主义共和国的教育经费，差不多占全预算的四分之三。在革命之前，学校里面都讲宗教课程，有许多学校讲圣经课。革命后就把教会与学校根本分开。现在苏联学校是非宗教性的学校，而且在社会发展、自然现象诸方面，都尽力用马列主义科学思想来解释，去掉神密的或宗教的说法。在苏联信教是自由的，但是在学校里面，一切课程都不能够用宗教解释。我们和你们都很了解，科学和宗教、迷信是势不两立的。刚才我所讲的是革命前沙皇俄罗斯民族的情况，其他民族更惨了，他们根本没有自己的文字，没有自己的文化，根本不能用自己的文字去学习、去读书，但是在苏联革命成功后宣布各民族都有用自己民族文字来学习和受教育的权利。从初等学校一直到高等学校，都要用自己的文字，不管那个民族他们完全用自己的文字来教学。在帝俄时代，教育是统治阶级压迫被统治阶级的一种工具，他用学校教育来造成人压迫人的理想。但是在苏联革命成功之后，我们学校也是一种工具——教育改造人民的工具，使他们能够有新的认识，能够了解马列主义，能够成为未来的新社会主义的建设者。在革命成功之后颁布的命令里，明确的指出要我们在课程内容方面，以至于教科书方面、设置方面，都要加以根本改造，当时这些工作是非常繁重的。
    以下讲关于成人教育问题。
    一、成人教育
    革命后，一九一九年，根据列宁同志提议，曾经发布过一个命令：扫除所有文盲，规定凡是八岁到五十岁的人一定要认字，要读书。革命后，因为新的建设要开始，各个部门都需要新的人材，所以在那时就大量开办训练班，这种训练班有的期间长一点，有的期间短一些，但是内容很多，是分门别类来办，在工厂、机关、学校里，都办有训练班，目的在使不识字的来识字，已经识字的人就提高其文化水平，或者识字的人，不懂专门科学，就入技术训练班。同时，经过各种训练班，改造旧知识分子。此外，为了从工人农民里边选拔优秀分子进一步提高他们的文化水平，因此，在革命成功后，初期还设立了工人大学，这种工人大学的任务，就是要由工农里面提拔培养新的知识分子。为了这个目的，我们就成立了工人大学。工人大学吸收一切工人农民，不管他受过什么教育。我们知道在帝俄时代很少有工人能够受中等教育，大部分连初级教育也很少受过，但是我们不能抛弃他们，我们一定要教育他们，使他们成为我们的新知识分子，我们所需要的知识分子一定是要从工农里边提拔出来的，而且当初我们选择的时候，我们很注意阶级出身，一定要从工人、农民里边提拔。这种工人大学有时是附设在大学里面，教他们的人都是大学教授或专家，使他们在毕业以后能升入专门学校或大学里面去读书。因为工人阶级同农民在过去根本没有受教育的机会，都是从事很艰苦的劳动的，所以在他们初学习的时候，确实感觉困难。比方有很多工人因常年从事劳动，他们显得很笨，笔都不会拿，年纪大的工人因读书甚至有哭的。虽然他们感觉到有困难，虽然他们在落泪，但是他们还很坚决的学习，不但白天而且夜间都学习，几至忘记了休息。他们为了要把握新的科学知识而尽量的学习。在他们初入学的第一年感到很多困难，很多不方便，第二年就容易一些了，第三年就更好得多了，在第四年第五年毕业的时候，他们已有了很丰富的知识，能升入到大学去，升入到专门学校去。这种措施，这种方法，就是我们革命成功之后初期的一种办法。
    扫除文盲，在组织方面、方法方面，我们曾经作了很大的一番工作，这个工作是非常繁重的，因为在帝俄时代，文盲占全国人口百分之八十，这个数目字是非常大的，要一下把文盲肃清，不是一件容易的事，而是繁重而非常的工作，所以在政府之下就设了一个扫除文盲非常委员会，专门负责扫除文盲工作，负组织和具体实施的责任。在非常委员会同人民教育部领导之下，把所有各机关的工作人员都组织起来参加了扫除文盲工作。无论工厂、学校、机关里的凡认识字的工作人员，没有不参加这个工作的。“每个识字的人，一定要教会一个不识字的人”，这是当时的重要口号。在扫除文盲工作开始以后，曾经发行了很多初级教科书，无论在工厂、机关、学校里面都可以看到这些教科书，看到很多人或成班的人在学习，或者是单人学习。扫除文盲工作的过程是相当久的，差不多费了二十年工夫。到一九四○年的时候，政府宣布已经肃清文盲五千万人，在苏联文盲是完全肃清了。他们在各方面能发展他们的天才。这是成人教育的简单过程。
    刚才所讲过的工人大学，就是因为从前工人、农民没有机会受教育，为了要立刻使他们受到教育，所以才临时设立了工人大学。到后来，因为教育制度已经正规化经常化了，已经不同于过去改造时期。青年、儿童们都能够入学，尤其是工农子女，他们不但都能够受中等教育而且能够升入大学或专门学校，因此，这样的工人大学已没有再办的必要了，到现在是都取消了。我们虽取消了工人大学，但现在苏联还有一种成人教育的方式。这就是现在所设的城市青年学校和乡村青年学校。城市青年学校是为工人设立的，乡村青年学校是为农民设立的。当时的工人大学学生是脱离生产的，但进这两种学校，是不脱离生产的，白天工作，晚上学习，一个礼拜有四天晚上课，其余时间自己在家自修。这两种学校都是正规学校，课程和普通中等学校一样。青年工农毕业后也领文凭，也可以升大学或专科学校，它和先前的工人大学不同处就在这一点。
    成人教育的第一阶段过去后，在新阶段开始时，斯大林同志又提出一个口号、一个任务，就是进一步提高工人和农民的文化水平，把工人、农民的文化科学水平提高到科学家、技术专家那样水平。所有苏联现在设立工业学院，专收原在工人大学毕业和刚才讲的补习学校毕业的工人农民，他们可以进这种学院继续学习，变成具有专门知识的科学技术人员，毕业后就可以当技术专家，或企业管理的领导干部。另外我们还有一个原则，就是要使工人、农民在科学上有一定修养，使他们能够和原来的科学工作者、技术家取得联系，取得友谊的合作机会。现在在苏联，任何一个科学家，不管他修养多大，都不能和从前一样脱离广大群众，他一定要同广大的有知识的群众联系。比方，苏联有名的科学家李森科，他是米邱林学说的发扬光大的继承者。他就是这样。李森科是农业专家，他做实验工作，并不尽是在他的化学实验室里，而且要与广大农民群众取得联系，他的工作要依靠广大农民群众。例如他现在发明了一种新的小麦种籽，原来的小麦长一个穗子，经过他研究以后，发明一种新小麦象树＠一样，长七八个穗子，收获数量比以前多八倍。他做实验不但只是在试验室里，而且要到各集体农庄去推广实现。所有的科学家都和工人、农民群众发生密切的联系。因此，在发明方面、在科学研究方面，不只是科学家在那里做，并且工人、农民本身也在那里做。现在很多工人、农民也有不少的创造和发明。有许多人曾得到过斯大林奖金。除开刚才所讲的这种方法之外，还实行一种更详细更具体的一种方法，使工人在政治方面在任何科学方面都能够提高他们文化水准，这就是很普遍地设立了图书馆、陈列馆、各种训练班，以提高工人、农民文化水准。同时在最近还成立了“科学知识推广协会”，请很多有名的科学家、有名的学者来做报告演讲，传播科学知识，任何工人、农民、知识分子都可以参加听讲，不仅是莫斯科、列宁格勒等有名的大城市，连小村镇、集体农庄也都举行这种讲演报告，目的在广泛的普及科学知识。不仅是使工农在政治、生产方面提高他们的水平，并且在文艺方面，也提高他们，从他们中间提拔天才，比方在工厂里、企业里也都搞艺术、跳舞、文学，举行许多座谈会。工人、农民在业余剧社或业余音乐社里，每一个人都得到发展的机会，有天才的可以选出来培养成为艺术家、音乐家、舞蹈家或美术家。上面所讲，就是苏联革命后，实行成年教育的工作过程，最初是扫除文盲，接着是入学读书，随后不只是扫除文盲，而且进一步提高文化、科学知识水平，现在是从各方面发展工农的天才。这就是苏联成年教育的过程。
    二、中小学教育的改造
    现在我开始讲一讲苏联中小学教育改造的经过情形，同时我还要讲一下我们在工作过程中所犯的错误、所走的弯路，我们希望中国将来在这一工作上避免我们所犯过的错误、我们所走的弯路。
    第一阶段就是在苏联革命成功之后，开始是否定旧的，摧毁旧的，建设新的，建设新的是根据政府所颁布的命令和宣布的办法来进行的。这个阶段最注重的是发展学校的数量，就是尽量多设立学校。学校固然主要由国家来办，除此之外，一切机关、企业都来从事这种工作，都帮着尽量多办学校。
    同时在这个阶段中，确定了一切学校的政治方向，就是培养新干部和改造旧知识分子。
    在工作过程中，我们曾经作过斗争（如果这种字眼能够用的话）。这就是我们既和右倾作斗争，同时也要和左倾作斗争。所谓右倾机会主义是怎样的情形呢？就是尽量保持原来学校和旧的教学方法，所以我们要向这种右倾机会主义作坚决的斗争。我们不只是和右倾机会主义作斗争，同时我们还要和左倾幼稚倾向作斗争。现在就讲一讲左倾幼稚倾向的来源。所谓左倾幼稚的危险怎样来的呢？这是起源于一种虚伪的科学观点，或者假的科学观点。在那时候在美国有一种资产阶级的教育实施，是一种很危险的思想。当时多半是透过这种美国科学、假科学深入到我们教育工作里面来。具体的指出来，象“道尔顿”制就是一个例子。他们的口号不是学校教育我们，而是生活教育我们，这就是说，否定学校的作用，可以不要学校。这是反列宁思想的，也是反科学思想的，因为照他们的主张，学校可以取消，可以不要，不必管制学校，不必把学校建立起来，这种思想是非常有害的。为什么呢？如果讲生活可以教育我们，学校作用就降低了，而学生认为既然生活可以教育我们，教员就没有必要了，于是教员、学校、教学方法，都不能有所发展。苏联共产党纠正了这种错误，纠正了这种偏向，纠正了右倾机会主义和左倾的幼稚思想。纠正错误之后，就确定出一种正确的教育制度。
    在苏联国民教育过程中大概可以分成两个阶段，一个时期是号召所有的人受教育，过了一定时期，就实行强迫教育，不但人们有权受教育，而且一定要强迫受教育。一九三○年国家发布了一道命令，实行强迫教育，就是任何人都要受教育。根据这个命令，在农村里实行四年制义务教育。每个人要受四年的初级学校教育，在城市里在工人住宅区，实行七年制的义务教育，每个人要受七年制的学校教育。在第二阶段，就是说在本年，一九四九年作了另外规定，就是说七年制的学校教育不只是在城市是必要的强迫的，而且在农村里也有必要，农村不仅限于四年制的小学，而且还要入七年制的学校。这就是说不但在城市里，并且在乡村里从今天起也要普遍实行七年制的强迫教育。另外在最近几年内一定要完成一个任务，就是除了七年制的学校之外，一定要把十年制的学校也成为强迫教育，不但在苏联本身，而且每一个加盟共和国都要实行十年制的强迫教育，每一个人一定要受十年教育。
    再说到在学校课程内容上来否认这种右倾机会主义的思想和左倾有害的思想，在这一方面，一九三一年颁布了一个正式的令令，政府对于过去十四年学校工作成绩，作了一个很严格的总结和批评，指出了学校工作有相当的成绩，同时特别指出一个缺点，就是在课程内容上没有使每个学生得到科学基础知识。这点是已往学校教育的缺点。党中央特别强调要在学校课程内容上，规定必须使每个学生能够掌握基本的科学知识。当然这种科学知识是进步的，科学的，是马列主义的唯物主义的科学。在这个命令发布之后，由党中央针对这种缺点发布了许多其他具体办法，驳斥了由美国传染来的错误的教育方法。这种由美国传来的有害思想，认为儿童教育不须经过学校，不一定用教员，须用专家，专家知识丰富，了解儿童的心理，明白儿童的习惯，由他来特别教育儿童。这就是说除了教员之外另外还得有一个专家。这专家测验学生，出很多难题，不但小学生不能解答，甚至于成年人也解答不了，如果学生不能解答，便认为学生智力不够，不能在这个学校里读书，须送到另外专为智力低下的儿童所设的学校去学习。这种思想是非常有害的，非常错误的，因为儿童的智力并不一定坏，只是由于出题太难，使儿童解答不出来便认为学生智力落后，而须送到另外的学校，这是故意阻碍儿童的发展。党中央发现了这种错误，就及时予纠正，下令取消这种办法，学校一定要有教员教，用一切办法来指导学生。党中央决议把当初认为智力不好，送走的儿童，仍然找回原来的学校，随后就发现这些学生的智力并不落后，同其他的儿童一样。我们的教员们大家一致认定儿童的智力没有什么大差别，除了少数之外，主要是教学法的好坏问题，如教的好，每个儿童都能够接受，都能够发展他的知能。
    刚才所讲的，是苏联教育在改造过程中所犯的错误，希望其他国家（新民主主义国家），尤其是中国，不要再犯这个错误。在中国也有这种有害思想的根源，这就是在中国也有美国教育思想的残余势力，难免仍在思想上保留着。对这一点，大家一定要警惕，要尽量避免不再犯这种错误。
    同时还有一点要提出来，就是苏联在革命之后，一方面要否定旧的，一方面要建立新的，但是在旧的里面有些好东西，我们也把它取消了，后来经党中央纠正，又把旧的里面值得我们学习的、值得我们应用的好东西保留下来，所以在新的里面也有旧的，但是这些旧的是好的，这些旧的对我们有益处。
    联共党中央特别强调学校课程最重要，绝对不能轻视。同时也须指出教员应该对学生各种的知识的学习负责任。学期完了之后，一定要测验每个学生的成绩。对学生学业、品行方面也规定出办法，比方一定要取消散漫现象，在小学校里教员到课堂学生要站起来，等教师到讲台之后才能坐下。这是一个基本纪律。另外，关于教学法，也有很多新的严格规定。上面所讲的是政府和党对于学校纪律、课程、教授方法以及学习方法的规定。
    另外就是前后课程要联贯，不管文学也好，地理也好，它都是连续的，今年讲的明年要接着讲，今年和明年前后所讲的课程是连贯的。而且要注意学生的接受能力，为学生所接受、所了解的东西才能订上课程，如果不能为学生所了解所接受的课程就不订。
    还有一点，就是对自然界的发展状况，人类社会的发展状况，一定要用唯物主义观点来解释；一定要避免用任何唯心主义观点来解释。而且我们确定学校有党性，教学方法也有党性。因为我们要在党的政策之下来实行我们教学法，我们的教学方法是一种党性教学方法。有一种错误思想，是认为学习可以脱离政治，也就是说学校课程可以脱离政治，不管地理、文学这些东西都与政治无关，好象不管任何国家，任何地方都一样，这种思想是错误的。还有一种错误思想，认为一切科目都可以完全照旧，只是除了个别科目之外，另外添一门政治课就可以了。这个想法也不对。我们要知道学校与政治是不能分开的，而学校正是政治的工具，所以它们的关系非常密切，绝不能分离的。问题并不是说在课程表里添一门政治科目就算完了，当然我们添政治科目是对的，而是应该在每个学科里加进政治内容，从政治方面加进新内容。现在我想举几个具体的例子：
    比如拿现在我们教的地理课来讲，我们把每一个国家地理教科书都看了，教科书里都有地图。如日德法西斯在苏德战争时候的地理教科书是怎样情形呢？德国的地理教科书他所讲的东方边界差不多到了苏联乌拉尔岭，日本地理所讲的呢，说它的西方边界也到了苏联乌拉尔岭。就是说他们两国国界都到了乌拉尔岭。比方说，现在拿日本地图来看，可能还没有东北字样，而是“满洲国”字样。所以我们要问一问他们的地理同我们的地理是不是一样？我们的地理是根据世界变化，根据政治变化而变化的。苏联的地理教员们都很高兴，上个学期开始的时候，讲中国地理，那时正是中国人民解放华北一部分，但到学期终了时，上海、南京，广州都解放了，中国地理就根据政治形势起了变化。现在应当另制一种新的中国地图，在新中国地图上面的颜色已经不是日本帝国主义、英美帝国主义者的颜色，而是中国红的颜色了。
    再拿历史课来说，乍一看认为历史这个东西那一国都是一样没有分别，实际上不是这样。我们看一看英国、美国他们怎样研究中国的历史，他们把中国历史看成是他们的殖民地的发展的历史，殖民地奴隶的历史，他们自己说：“对中国有很大贡献，把高度的文明都带给了中国”。但是我们苏联人民同中国人民怎么样来看中国历史呢？我们把中国历史看成是中国人民的解放运动的历史，同时根据这种历史的发展，中国人民把带给中国“文明”的人们都赶掉了，都赶回他们本国去了。在我们离开北京之前，曾经到毛主席那里去过，他曾经向我们讲中国人民解放的情形：起先国民党统治集团赶我们的时候，追我们的时候，好象是赶鸭子似的，不但剥夺了我们的言论自由、出版自由和其他种种自由，甚至于不让我们在这土地上面走，他们只给了我们一个很小的房间，这个房间就叫做监狱。因为当时不准我们在地面上走，我们没有办法，只好到北方很小一块地方去，但这是过去的历史。现在新的历史已经展开了新的一页，也就是说我们现在赶他们也就象赶鸭子一样的赶。我们现在能够很自由的在中国土地上面走来走去，建设我们新的社会、新的生活，这就是历史的一种党性。英美帝国主义者还不承认中华人民共和国，但是苏联就首先承认了！而且我们很重视这个历史。在将来我们教育子女的时候，让他们很认真的来读，来保护这一伟大的历史！因此，我们的课程就不能老是照旧套了，我们要根据新的历史新的生活来订我们的课程。根据这种道理，我们在教科书方面作了很多的工作，改编新的教科书，但是这个工作很繁重，不是几天能作成的，到现在为止我们教科书可以算是标准的教科书，这种教科书我们可以用一个相当的时间。
    同时在教学法方面我们也有改革，旧的教学法只限于四点：有了教员、黑板、粉笔、书本就够了。但是现在只是这四点还不够。同时过去小孩子读书，只是死读死记，但是在苏联学校里面已经重新规定了一种教学方法。
    第一、要大量的做参考工夫，使学生在图表、画图方面作出种种表格，使他们除了书本之外能够亲自在这方面作一些工作。如果只是很呆板的一本书，里边没有什么画图也没有图表，小孩子读书就没兴趣。如果我们供给他很多图表、画图，小孩子们读书兴趣就提高了。
    第二、要注重实验工作、实习工作，一定要使学生自己看着图表，亲自动手做理化试验的试验工作。
    学校一定要设试验室，另外要在学校附近建设校园、菜园、小规模农场，总之要有一块土地给学生亲自去实习。在莫斯科附近有一个学校，苏联很有名的女英雄丹娘在那里读过书，这个学校在以前我去的时候还很荒僻，最近我又去过，情形不同了，那里植遍花树和果树，这都是为学生实习用的。另外在莫斯科还有一个学校，在它附近学田农场里面有五百种植物，这些种子都是从高级学校试验室拿来，由学生亲自来作试验种植的。
    三、对知识分子干部的改造工作
    关于苏联对知识分子干部改造教育工作，我们应当很坦白地讲，苏联对知识分子的改造工作并不是一天两天完成的，这种改造工作是很繁重的，而且需要相当久的时间。在革命成功初期，甚至于有教育工作者怠工。教员们拒绝到新的学校上课，那时候是非常艰苦的，当时我们只有一面依靠教育工作者中的进步分子进行工作，一面同我们的敌人进行坚决的斗争，打倒怠工。同时还要有很大的耐心来改造教育广大的知识分子群众。有一部分知识分子他不了解革命任务，对革命认识不够。因为在当时有一部分知识分子认为工人阶级不一定能够了解理论，不能够接受文化，不能够发展文化。
    他们认为只有他们自己知识很深，学问很高，而不明白过去他们只不过是为资产阶级服务，他们没有认识到他们过去的错误。他们并没有明白当时即有两种思想：一种思想是资产阶级的思想，一种思想是无产阶级思想，进步的新的思想。他们并没有分别出来，也没有了解到这一点：就是曾经起过进步作用的资产阶级思想，现在已随着资产阶级社会的没落而没落了，他们不了解现在资产阶级思想已经不是进步的思想了，不是新的思想了，不是前进的思想了。在现在资产阶级思想，已经是没落的反动的思想了，他们所主张的就是种族歧视、民族互相压迫，他们要少数帝国主义者统治世界，他们在那里制造战争，这就是现在资产阶级思想。另外一方面社会主义思想，就不是这样，这种社会主义思想，就是要民族间互相友谊，争取民主、争取和平，这是一种进步思想。这就是说，他们的教育与我们的教育，他们的科学与我们的科学，原则上根本是两种东西。
    比方拿物理学来讲，在美国他们曾经发明了原子弹，但这种秘密一直到最近他们不肯向我们公开，他们为什么要向我们保守这种秘密呢？就是想利用这个原子弹保持着他对世界的统治，他们要利用原子弹发动新战争，残害老年人、青年人，虽然他不肯向我们公开原子核的秘密，但是我们苏联学者，不用他们，也发明了这种分裂原子核的方法。我们发明了原子核的分裂，我们就坚决利用原子能，但是我们并不象他们把它利用在战争上，我们的目的是用之于和平目的，我们利用原子能改变世界，改善人民生活。
    于是在我们面前有两条路：一条是资产阶级溃烂的路线，预备制造战争，预备残害人类。另外我们也有一条路，这条路是争取和平、反对战争，我们为人民谋福利。到现在为止没有第三条道路。如果有人在这两条道路中间徘徊，他就可能掉到最反动的资产阶级道路上去。因此在我们改造知识分子的时候，我们曾经讲过，究竟你要走那条路？要想想，选择那条道路，是走没落溃烂的资产阶级道路，或者是走新生的道路？我们争取的并不是昨天，而是明天的人类的幸福，这方面工作是非常繁重而艰巨。我们曾经举行多次会议，比方举行讨论会，怎样使知识分子来学习，使他们能够进一步学习，能够进步，在这方面所费的工夫是很大的。我们曾经动员所有的教员，使他们本身自动的来参加怎样改造我们的学校、怎样改造我们教学方法。我们曾经用很大的耐心去揭穿、去反驳反动的思想。如果这些经过改造的知识分子，今天发生了错误，我们用很大耐心向他们解释说明他所犯的错误，我们曾经很好的使用过布尔什维克的批评方法，我们曾经做过自我批评、互相批评。批评方法曾经得到很大效果。我们要每个知识分子了解我们政府、党的政策。现在在苏联每一个文化工作者，都记得斯大林同志在第十八次党代表会议上所讲的话，他说：“没有什么必要使医学专家同时又是物理学家，或是植物学家；反之，也没有必要使后者又是前者。但是有一个科学部门是所有一切科学部门中的布尔什维必需知道的，这就是马列主义关于社会、关于社会发展规律、关于无产阶级革命发展规律、关于社会主义建设事业发展规律、关于共产主义胜利的科学。”这种改造工作，我们曾经付出很大耐心，很大精力，但是到现在为止，我们可以讲我们苏联知识分子已经完全能够在所谓政治道德方面，得到一个统一的思想，就是说他们能为苏联人民服务，他们的思想已经与工人、农民沟通一气。在苏联任何劳动都受人尊敬，国民教师的工作也是最受人尊敬的劳动之一。在苏联做教师的所得到的报酬是很高的，如果从事教育工作很久、很老、应该退休的时候，他可以从政府得到养老金，这些养老金数目是他薪金的百分之四十。教员们员只要工作成绩很好，可以得到奖章或者勋章。教员们还可以被选到政府机关工作，上至最高苏维埃下至地方苏维埃，他们都可以被选举去作代表，因为政府同党关心教员们，所以在苏联教育工作者，非常热爱党和政府。
    四、中国教育工作观感
    最后在我结束这个报告的时候，我想讲几句话：有一位同志让我讲一讲我们这次到中国来我们对中国学校所获得的印象，现在我想讲一讲，因我这次到中国来所参观的学校并不多，只参观几个学校，所以我不能讲到整个中国的情形。但是现在我可以讲一讲我所得到的最主要的印象，这种印象是好的方面，当我同中国小学生们，同中国教员们见面的时候，我所感觉到的是：（一）我感组织力很强，同时纪律也很严格。（二）我感觉到学生们求知欲很强很高。无论我到那一课堂去，无论看见讲那一种课目，我都发现学生注意力很强，全部注意听讲，能够从教员方面得到更丰富更完满的知识。
    另外我感觉到中国现在所进行的革命，对他们反响是非常显明的。我们看到在每个课堂里面都已经开始了政治课，在政治方面已经对学生进行教育工作，甚至于很小的小学生，他们也在读这种对革命有正确认识的材料。当我走进一个二年级教室的时候，我看到教员正在给他们讲毛主席怎样去慰问一个伤兵的时候，学生们所听到的是这样：这个伤兵很愿意在他死前能够看到毛主席。但是毛主席离伤兵地方很远，然而他还骑着马跑到这个地方来，还能来得及看见这个伤兵。这个伤兵对毛主席说了最后离别的话。这个伤兵牺牲了性命完全为中国人民解放事业，为人民的幸福，为自由的新中国而牺牲了。这个伤兵在临死的时候，曾经对毛主席讲：“我对于死并不怕，因为我是为人民事业而牺牲的。现在我能见到了你，我是多么光荣。”我在参观讲这课的时候，看到一个女孩子听完了以后，就落泪了，也可能是这个女孩子想起了他的父亲，想起来了为人民事业而牺牲的父亲。同时我看到许多的小孩子们都是面目很沉重，我相信将来这些小孩子长大起来一定能够继续完成他们复兴的伟大事业。
    同时我还看到一个学校里面正在上俄文课，在中国学校里面，俄文课是正在积极的学习。我走进一个课堂，那里在教俄文，我就请求俄文教员，让我去教，我就上课，正好他讲“学生”这个字，我就写苏联的学生向你们致敬，经过学习之后，他们就可以了解，都能读了，我写的是“代表苏联学生向你们致敬”，等他们学会之后，他们写一句中国字：“我代表中国学生向苏联致敬！”我当时感到这种友谊空气是非常好的，我一定要把他们所写的这句话带回苏联去。但是我们知道在中国未来的国民教育工作，学校工作还很艰巨很重大，课程与教学法种种工作，都很艰巨很困难。首先应当注意每一个学校一定要大量充实设备，使学生能有研究机会、实习机会，这是很要紧的。当初我们苏联充实教育改造工作所走的路是很长的，但是我很相信，将来各位同志所走的路一定比我们短的多。我们现在应当很坦白的很诚恳的向你们讲我们对于中国知识分子抱着一种很大的尊敬，一种热爱的心。同时我们知道中国的知识分子，中国的文化工作者，艺术家，他们向来在反动势力之下也没有低过头，不管是对帝国主义者，对国民党反动派向来没有屈服过的，我相信在他们当中有很多人过去都住过窑洞，都作过地下工作，都拿几十年的时间化费在战争上，拿所有的精神都用在为人民革命事业上。同时我们很相信中国知识分子，中国的文化工作者，他们在现在中国人民已经获得解放，中国人民革命已经胜利，开始文化建设的时候，我们相信他们是不会走到错误路上去的，他们会很光荣的走上为民主为人民幸福的路上去，而且根据我们的经验，我们确实知道任何困难，只要有共产党来领导，是没有不能克服的。所以今天我们同在座各位同志离别的时候，我们祝你们在将来改造学校工作上，在将来文化建设工作上，一定能取得最大最光荣的成功。而且我们希望中国知识分子你们在将来一定要成为中国共产党的最可靠最忠实的一种支柱。现在我们呼几个口号：
    中办两大民族永远的不可摧毁的友谊万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国人民最好的朋友全世界人民的导师斯大林同志万岁！
