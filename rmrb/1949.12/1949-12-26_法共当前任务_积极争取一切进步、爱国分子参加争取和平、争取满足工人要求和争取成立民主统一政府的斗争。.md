    Current Tasks of the French Communist Party
　  Actively Strive for All Progressive and Patriotic Elements to Participate in the Struggle for Peace, for the Fulfillment of Workers' Demands, and for the Establishment of a Democratic and Unified Government.
    Dohlenz pointed out: According to the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau, the task of the French Communist Party is to more actively strive for members of the grassroots organizations of the Socialist Party, Catholics, Republicans, and patriotic elements to participate in the struggle for peace, for the fulfillment of workers' demands, and for the establishment of a democratic and unified government.
    When discussing the Tito clique, Dohlenz pointed out: This group of spies and police officers are in fact the latest type of Trotskyites acting as the vanguard of counter-revolution. Yugoslavia is no longer a country of New Democracy; it has become a country of fascist dictatorship. Now in power there is a group of adventurers who have betrayed the trust of the working people by insidious means. They are supported by rich peasants, and with the support of American imperialists and at the behest of American imperialists, they are restoring capitalist exploitation. Tito and his gang have sold out their country to the United States.
    Some people say, "How could Rajk and Kostov become spies?" This question should be answered in this way: Our past experience tells us that the bourgeoisie cultivates their lackeys in the workers' movement, and they even use money or intimidation to buy over some politicians who have accidentally sneaked into the workers' class party. Now, if we draw lessons from the trials in Budapest and Sofia, we see that as long as the time-tested and proven principle of democratic centralism has not been accurately implemented in various party organizations, spies and traitors can sneak into responsible positions and maintain these positions. A utilitarian attitude will create factional or clique politics, providing favorable ground for police spies, because then everyone will protect each other, and party discipline will be replaced by clique discipline. This situation is not necessarily caused by stubborn prejudice; sometimes, the remaining individualism of our party members, the acute illness or vanity of the petty bourgeoisie, can also cause this situation. The situation in Somme is exactly like this. In that province, the ignorance of principles and the lack of ideological preparation of many of our party members caused the so-called Langao case, which has now been successfully resolved on a principled basis.
    Under the conditions of sharp intensification of the class struggle, weak elements will inevitably shrink back. They lose courage and hesitate to participate in the struggle. This is especially true of those who joined our party from petty-bourgeois environments during a relatively calm period. This is exactly what we see in some of our party groups. For example, on the issue of attitude towards the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, workers rarely have hesitation and doubt, but such hesitation and doubt exist in some petty bourgeois. Incidentally, these doubts are often used as the sole excuse for withdrawing from the struggle. We believe that there is no need to retain those who have proved themselves absolutely incompatible with the working class, its ideals, and its Communist Party. The meaning of our existence lies in revolutionary struggle and preparation for the dictatorship of the proletariat. If the petty bourgeoisie does not agree with this, if they challenge the principles of our party, then we will not retain them, but rather make them withdraw from our party.

    法共当前任务
　  积极争取一切进步、爱国分子参加争取和平、争取满足工人要求和争取成立民主统一政府的斗争。
    多列士指出：按照共产党情报局的决议，法国共产党的任务，是更积极地争取社会党基层组织的党员、天主教分子、共和分子和爱国分子参加争取和平，争取满足工人要求和争取成立民主统一政府的斗争。
    多列士在论及铁托集团时指出：这帮间谍和警吏，事实上是最新式的作为反革命先锋的托派。南斯拉夫已不再是新民主主义的国家，它已变成了法西斯独裁的国家。现在那里当权的是一批用诡谲的办法背叛了劳动人民的信任的冒险家，他们得到富农的支持，并在美国帝国主义者的支持下和奉美国帝国主义者之命，正在恢复资本主义的剥削。铁托及其匪帮已把他们的国家出卖给美国了。
    有些人说：“拉伊克和科斯托怎么能会当了奸细呢？”这一问题应该这样来回答：我们过去的经验告诉我们，资产阶级在工人运动中培植下他们的走狗，他们甚至用金钱或是恫吓的办法收买一些偶然钻进工人阶级政党里面来的政客。现在，如果我们从布达佩斯和索非亚的审判中吸取教训的话，我们就看到：只要民主集中制这个久经试验和考验的原则，还没有在各种党的组织中确切旅行的话，间谍和奸细分子就能够钻到负责的职位，并保持这些职位。功利主义的态度会造成小集团或派别政策，给警察奸细提供有利的地盘，因为那样就会每一个人都互相庇护，而党的纪律就会被小集团的纪律所代替。造成这种情形的并不一定是由于固执成见，有时，我党党员的个人主义残余，小资产阶级的急性病或虚荣心，也会造成这种情形。索姆省的情况就正是这样。在该省，许多我党党员对原则的无知和思想上的无准备，就造成了被称为朗葛奥案的事情，这件事情现在已在原则的基础上很成功地解决了。
    在阶级斗争尖锐化的条件下，不坚强的分子是不可避免地要退缩的。他们失掉了勇气，并对参加斗争犹豫。这特别是指那些在相对平静的时期从小资产阶级环境中参加我党的党员。我们在我党某些小组中所见到的，恰恰就是这样。举例说，在对苏联和人民民主国家的态度问题上，工人很少发生犹豫和怀疑，但在有些小资产阶级中却存在着这种犹豫和怀疑。附带说一句，这些怀疑常常作为退出斗争的唯一口实。我们认为，对于这些已经证明了自己绝对与工人阶级、它的理想和它的共产党不相适应的人，没有必要挽留他们。我们生存的意义在于革命斗争和准备无产阶级专政。如果小资产阶级不同意这一点，如果他们对我党的原则挑战，那么，我们将不是挽留他们，而是使他们退出我党。
