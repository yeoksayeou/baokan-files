　　About Little People's Books
　　Yú Gàn
　　Comic strip books are called "little people's books" in the North. In fact, everyone knows that their readers are not just children.

　　Most of the little people's books rented on the northern bookstalls come from Shanghai, and not many are printed locally.

　　All I know is that the little people's books from Shanghai used to be the same old supernatural and erotic stuff for the past twenty years. After liberation, when a batch was shipped to Jinan and Tianjin, they were all returned by the booksellers, who said that the readers here no longer wanted this disgusting garbage. This blow made the minds of the old comic strip artists in Shanghai much clearer.

　　There were more than seventy of them. In the past, their main sales channels were South China, Southeast Asia, North China, and Northeast China. They used to print four or five thousand to eight thousand copies of each book. Shanghai itself could usually only sell one thousand five hundred "ge" (個, a trade term). Since they could no longer go to Southeast Asia and South China in the summer and autumn of this year, their hopes were half in the North. The North opened up but didn't want their old stuff, so their business plummeted, from publishing eighteen types a day to gradually reducing to only two or three types a day.

　　This should have made them realize something, but some laggards always thought that their comic strip drawings were the best, and couldn't be changed or moved at all. The ironclad lesson finally made another, more progressive, group determined to improve. They were willing to humbly accept external assistance, and they are learning. But on the one hand, they wanted to do better but lacked the strength, and on the other hand, they were still eager for profit, so they rushed to publish several new titles, the content of which was neither here nor there, and some were very undesirable. For example, in "Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village," they couldn't figure out where the theme was, so Song Jiang kept shouting "Heaven will destroy me!" and finally ended by forcibly marrying Hu Sanniang (一丈青扈三娘) to Wang Ying (矮脚虎王英), and refused to use the scene of the masses dividing the Zhu Family Village's property and sending off the Liangshan heroes. In order to stick to their convention of a grand reunion, the whole book's message appeared ambiguous.

　　Some of their experience is worth adopting, but they can only take on a small part of the task of improvement. Most of it must fall on new publishers.

　　There are seven or eight new publishers, and they have published nearly sixty types in half a year. You can see them in almost all the bookstores in Beijing. It has indeed been changed, and it is indeed better, but there are naturally still many shortcomings. The biggest problem is that these new little people's books have not been widely rented in bookstalls and have not replaced the old, poisonous little people's books.

　　Therefore, I feel that the people in the North who have always rented little people's books are in a situation where they don't want to read the old ones and can't see the new ones. They lack entertainment and food for thought, which is worth noting.

　　In addition to hoping that the publishers in Shanghai will make progress in their work and change course, I also think that Beijing is already the cultural hub. We need to do this work locally and print new comic strip drawings in large quantities.

　　It is indeed a cause, one of meaningful and valuable causes. (December 5, 1949, Beijing)

　　关于小人书
    余干
    连环图画在北方叫做小人书，事实上，大家知道它的读者绝不仅仅是小人。
    北方书摊上出租的小人书，多半是从上海来的，本地印行的不多。
    我只知道，从上海来的小人书，原先是二十年来如一日的神怪的黄色的那一套；解放以后，有一批运到济南、天津时，被书商全部打了回票，说这边的读者再不吃这些倒胃的垃圾。这一个打击，使上海的旧联环画工作者的头脑，顿时清醒了不少。
    他们有七十多家，过去主要的销路是华南、南洋和华北、关外，他们每一种书过去印到四、五千到八千本，上海本地通常只能卖出一千五百个（个是他们的行话），自从今年夏秋两季南洋华南不能去，希望半在北方，北方的路通而不要他们的旧东西，他们的营业就一落千丈，从每天出十八种，逐渐减少到每天只能出两三种。
    这是应该可以使他们觉悟的，但却有一部分落后者，始终认为讲连环图画唯他们的最好，一改也改不得，一动也动不得，铁硬的教训到底使另一部分比较进步的也下了改良的决心，他们肯虚心地接受外界扶助了，他们也正在学习。但一方面，心有余而力不足，一方面还是急于求利，以致抢着出几本题目很新的东西，内容弄得似是而非，有的非常要不得。例如“三打祝家庄”，他们摸不清主题在那里，使宋江连呼“天亡我也”，最后硬生生用一丈青扈三娘同矮脚虎王英成亲做结束，不肯用群众分得祝家庄的财物和欢送梁山好汉的场面，为了拘泥于他们的大团圆的惯例，使全书的意识显得模糊了。
    他们的若干经验是值得我们采取的，但改良的任务，他们只能担负一小部分去，大部分是要落在新的出版者身上的。
    新的出版者有七八家，半年内一共出了近六十种吧，在北京市书店的门市部差不多都能看到。改是的确改了，好也的确好些，但缺点自然还很多，最大的问题是这些新小人书，还没有大量地在书摊上出租，还没有代替旧的有毒的小人书的地位。
    因此，我觉得北方各地一向租看小人书的人们，是落在旧的不要看、新的看不到的情形下面了，他们少了一种消遣，也少了一种食粮，这是值得注意的。
    除了希望上海的出版者在工作中求进步，改弦易辙以外，我又想，北京已是文化的枢纽所在了，我们需要在本地也来做做这一项工作，大量地印行新的连环图画。
    它的确是事业，有意义、有价值的事业之一。（一九四九。十二、五北京）
