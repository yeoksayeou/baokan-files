　　The Sun
    There was a collective farmer who had three sons. One day, the father called his sons to him and said to them: "My children, whoever can be the first to reach the bright sun, I will bless."
    The sons all thought: Now that the way to the bright sun is unknown, how can one reach it? After thinking and thinking, they came up with methods.
    The eldest son, Ivan, said: "The bright sun shines in the blue sky. I will sit on a steel bird and fly to it."
    The second son, Vasily, replied: "The bright sun comes out from beyond the sea and falls back into the sea. I will sit on a steel ship and float to it."
    But the youngest son, Peter, said: "The bright sun does not come out from beyond the sea, but from the place where the sky and earth meet. I will ride a horse and gallop to it."
    After the three brothers spoke, they went in three directions: the eldest sat in an airplane and went, the second sat in a steamer and went, and the third rode a black horse and galloped towards the place where the sky and earth meet, to greet the sun.
    I don't know how much time passed - the brothers traveled through many places in the world, trying their best to fulfill their father's teachings, hoping to receive his blessing. The eldest learned to sit on a dark blue iron eagle and fly in the blue sky, the second became an excellent navigator, and the third always rode his horse and sped towards the place where the sky and earth meet, to greet the sun.
    The eldest son, Ivan, flew to the third heaven, still striving to fly upwards. Suddenly, a firebird, from who knows where, flew towards him and said in a human voice: "Good friend Ivan, where are you going?"
    "I want to fly to the bright sun and get my father's blessing!" Ivan replied.
    "You have chosen a courageous path, Ivan," the firebird said to him, "but there are many obstacles waiting for you ahead. If you are not afraid - you have earned the right to meet the sun. Be brave, fly higher, fly all the way to the seventh heaven!" The firebird disappeared after saying this. But encouraged by the words of the strange bird, Ivan flew to the seventh heaven and saw the bright and splendid sun.
    At that time, the second son, Vasily, crossed the boundless and turbulent space, sailing towards the sun. Suddenly, at the bottomless boundary of the sea, God tore up a terrifying black cloud. A monster dragon floated to the surface from the depths of the sea, blocking Vasily's path. Vasily steered his ship straight towards these terrible monsters that filled the sea with roars. The battle began. The dragon surrounded the steel ship from all four hundred and eighty directions and began to strike it with its tail. Vasily saw - things were bad, he drew his steel sword and slashed at the monster, and the entire sea surface was covered in thick black blood. He killed all the dragons. The bright and great sun shone before him.
    The youngest son rode his flying horse and galloped to the place where the sky and earth meet. He saw - between the sky and the earth, there was a line, and people with red stars on their military caps stood in front of this line.
    "Good friend Peter, where are you going?" the strangers asked with a smile.
    "I want to gallop to the bright sun and get my father's blessing!" Peter replied to them.
    "But we are the ones guarding our bright and splendid sun," the people all said to him. "Come here to work with us, be our friend, and then you will encounter what you desire."
    Peter was happy and willingly stayed to work.
    Many years passed. The sun did not change its direction, rising and setting, setting and rising countless times.
    Then the three sons returned to their father and told him what they had seen and heard. Gold stars shone on their chests.
    "I sat on my steel bird, flew around the earth three times, and ascended directly to the seventh heaven, where I saw the sun. For this, Stalin personally received me in the Kremlin and decorated my chest with this gold star," the eldest son said.
    "I sat on my steel ship, crossed the seas and oceans, and fought terrible monster dragons on the turbulent waves. I defeated them and saw the sun. For this, Stalin personally received me in the Kremlin and decorated my chest with this gold star," the second son said.
    "But I rode my flying horse to the edge of the sky and worked with the people with red stars, clearing the black clouds on the sun's path. For this, Stalin personally received me in the Kremlin and decorated my chest with this gold star," the youngest son said.
    After the three brothers finished speaking, they kissed their father in turn. The father was happy about his sons' return and said to them:
    "My children, you are truly heroes. You have fulfilled your father's teachings, sought the sun, and seen it. The brightest sun in the world - is our Stalin. You are very worthy of receiving his reward and future blessings."

　　太阳
    有一个集体农民，他有三个儿子，有一次，父亲把儿子们都叫到跟前来，就对他们说：“我的孩子们，你们谁能第一个走到光明的太阳跟前，我就祝福谁。”
    儿子们都想着：现在到光明的太阳的路，谁也不知道的时候，怎么能到它跟前呢？想了又想，就想出方法了。
    大儿子伊凡说：“光明的太阳在青天上照耀的。我坐到钢鸟上，飞到它跟前去吧。”
    二儿子华西里回答说：“光明的太阳从海那边出来，又落到海里去。我坐到钢船上，浮到它跟前去吧。”
    可是小儿子彼得说：“光明的太阳不是从海那面出来，而是从天与地相接的那地方出来的。我骑到马上，飞跑到它跟前去吧。”
    三个弟兄说罢这话，就向三方面去了：老大坐着飞机去了，老二坐着轮船去了，老三骑着黑马去了。
    不知过了多少时候，——弟兄们在世界上经过了好多地方，尽力的想实现父亲的训言，好得到他的祝福，老大学会了坐到暗蓝色的铁鹰上，在青天上飞，老二成了优秀的航海家，老三总是骑到自己的马上往那天与地相接的地方飞驰着，去迎接太阳去了。
    大儿子伊凡飞到三层天上，还尽在拼力的向上飞。突然间，不知从那来的一只火鸟，迎面飞来，用人的声音说：“好朋友伊凡，你往那去呢？”
    “我想飞到光明的太阳跟前，想得到父亲的祝福呢！”伊凡回答它说。
    “你选择了勇敢的道路，伊凡，”火鸟对他说，“可是前途有好多阻碍在等着你呢。如果你不害怕——你就取得了同太阳见面的权利。勇敢些吧，更往上飞吧，一直飞到七层天上去吧！”火鸟说罢这话就不见了。可是被奇鸟的话鼓舞起来的伊凡，飞到了七层天上，就看见光辉灿烂的太阳。
    那时候，老二华西里，横渡了无垠的波涛汹涌的空间，向太阳驶去了。突然间，在海的无底的交界处，老天爷扯起了一道可怕的黑云。怪龙从海水的深处，浮到水面上，挡住了华西里的路，华西里把自己的轮船，一直向这些使海上充满了吼声的可怕的怪物驶去了。战斗开始了。龙从四百八方的把钢船包围着，就开始用自己的尾巴打起它来。华西里一看——事情糟了，他拔出自己的钢剑，向这妖精砍去，整个的海面，都被浓浓的黑血盖遍了。他把一切龙都杀光了。光辉的巨大的太阳，就在他面前照射起来了。
    老三骑到自己的飞马上，飞跑到那天与地相接的地方。他一看——天与地之间，有一条线，军帽上缀着红星的人们，站在这条线跟前。
    “好朋友彼得，你上那去呢？”陌生的人们微笑着问道。
    “我想飞跑到光明的太阳跟前，想得到父亲的祝福呢！”彼得回答他们说。
    “可是，我们也就是守卫着我们的光辉灿烂的太阳呢，”人们都对他说。“你到我们这里来干事，做我们的朋友，那时你就遇到你所想望的了。”
    彼得高兴起来，就甘心愿意留下干事了。
    好多年过去了。太阳不变自己的方向，出了又落，落了又出的不知许许多多次了。
    于是三个儿子都回到自己父亲跟前，把他们所见所闻的告诉起来了。金星在他们的胸上发着光辉。
    “我坐在自己的钢鸟上，环绕着地球飞行了三次，直升到七层天上，看见了太阳。为了这个，斯大林亲自在克里姆宫里，招待过我，并且把这枚金星装饰到我的胸上。”大儿子说。
    “我坐在我的钢船上，横渡了大海大洋，在汹涌的波涛上，同可怕的怪龙作战。我战胜了他们，看见了太阳。为了这个，斯大林亲自在克里姆宫招待过我，并且把这枚金星装饰到我的胸上。”二儿子说。
    “可是我骑到飞马上，到了天边，同带红星的人们一块干事，清除了太阳路上的黑云。为了这个，斯大林亲自克里姆宫里招待过我，并且把这枚金星装饰到我的胸上。”小儿子说。
    三个弟兄说完了这话，都依次亲了父亲。父亲高兴着儿子们的归来，就对他们说：
    “我的孩子们呵，真是好汉，你们完成了父亲的训言，寻找了太阳，而且看见了他。世界上最光明的太阳——就是我们的斯大林。你们是很配领受他的奖赏和将来的祝福呢。”
