　　Great Emotion
    Ilya Ehrenburg

    In foreign countries, where languages are not understood and customs are unfamiliar, I have nevertheless often suddenly seen a familiar face, and everything becomes familiar and easy to understand. Once, I went to Kiruna, a Swedish city within the Arctic Circle. Everything there astonished me: Lapp reindeer mixed in with cars, girls were graceful and attentive, and gentlemen wore top hats. I thought: how incredible all this is! Later, I was invited to a home, and there I saw a painting on the wall: Stalin in a coat, striding forward. I smiled, and my taciturn host (the secretary of the miners' union) also smiled. He said affectionately, "Stalin."
    I heard young men and women in Madrid calling out this name frequently as they climbed the Guadarrama Mountains. "Stalin," this word may have been the last word they spoke in their short lives—they went to the battlefield saying this word. I have heard the same word in remote villages in Albania. This familiar person in a coat has also been there. He has also visited faraway America. On the banks of the Mississippi River, with its cotton, black people, and misfortune, I walked into a small house—a simple table covered with various rags, bare walls—no picture or mirror, but a small photograph. A black man pointed it out to me and said, "This is Stalin." This name is a password that destroys the walls erected by insidious people; and under this small photograph, a black man embraced a white man for the first time in his life, treating the white man as a friend....
    Stalin travels around the world: when the young Chinese people liberated ancient Beijing, they saw him. He visits Indian prisons, speaking sincerely encouraging words to prisoners sentenced to death. He walks along all the roads of the world in his coat. Among these roads are some that will forever be remembered by every Soviet person: the roads of Smolensk Oblast and Belarus, the roads of Ukraine and Lithuania, the roads of Oryol, Kursk, and Voronezh, the roads roughened by bombs and shells, the roads flattened by tanks and soaked with the blood of comrades, the heart-wrenching roads of war. Stalin advanced along all these roads with the soldiers. When they were silent (their hearts numb with pain), he was also silent. He sang military songs with them, dragged cannons out of the mud, and built bridges. He sat with them beside the faint campfire in the dead of winter, swimming across rivers, on ferries, on pontoon bridges, in tents. He rescued the wounded, scouted everywhere, and was the first to enter the first street of Berlin. When the vanguard of France liberated the town of Limoges (located in southwestern France), he was also with them. He entered Banska Bystrica with the Slovak guerrillas. He is the commander-in-chief of the mighty army, he drafts victorious plans, meticulously plans every battle, his eyes scrutinize the maps of the General Staff, and at the same time, he is an ordinary soldier, his footprints have traveled many roads, suffering and enduring hardships with all the people, and winning victories together with all the people.
    Recently, I visited Rome. Peace supporters—one hundred thousand Roman residents gathered in a wide square at dusk. People gave speeches in various languages; workers lit torches, and I saw Stalin's portrait hanging on the walls of the ancient Roman Lateran Palace. The flickering, warm light illuminated that familiar face. People went home encouraged; they knew that Stalin would defend peace.
    The faith of hundreds of millions of ordinary people living on the banks of the Volga and the Ganges, on the banks of the Loire and the Amazon, is linked to the image of Stalin....
    Now, countries around the world are sending Stalin all kinds of gifts: the finest manuscripts, embroideries, paintings, and carpets. One gift is soil, which at first glance seems incomprehensible. Workers from Suresnes, France, gathered a handful of soil from Mont Valérien Fortress, where the occupiers shot communists—a handful of soil soaked with the blood of the best people—and sent it to Stalin. The shootings took place at dawn, when the warm sunlight, which gives life to everything, was beginning to shine from the east. In the last moments of their lives, these people called out the great name they loved more than once.
    American strategists, planning another heinous massacre, are calculating the number of divisions, the number of thousands upon thousands of bombers and piles of bombs. Some of them say: the air force decides everything. Others, more cautious, are thinking about feeding and arming European vassals. However, what exactly is holding back these lunatics? Not only is it our vast area, not only is it the fraternal feelings of the people of all countries towards us, not only is it the power of our army and the achievements of our scientists, but also the memory of the shameful ending of those guys who, relying on their temporary technical superiority, attacked us by surprise. They were bruised and battered by the flesh-and-blood Great Wall built by the Soviet people, by the spiritual power of our people, by Stalin's fortitude, will, and strength.
    Stalingrad was the turning point of World War II, and this is by no means "accidental." The Soviet people could not let this city fall into the hands of the enemy, because it was both the nerve center of the front and the city of Stalin. There are absolutely no accidental events in history. It is no accident that fascism was extinguished; and it is also no accident that the new era of history was opened by Russian workers, not by American braggart writers.
    Many thoroughfares, boulevards, streets, and squares in large and small towns in European countries are named after Stalingrad. In this way, because their own addresses or the addresses of their friends are named in this way, these people who remember who rescued them from fascist enslavement repeatedly call out this great name in their daily lives. In a village in Limoges, farmers named their only street "Stalingrad," and this street in this village may express the feelings of the people of various countries more eloquently than the thoroughfares of major cities.
    Stalin is the confidant of hundreds of millions of ordinary people. I have repeatedly seen the expression of this sincere love. An old Norwegian from Lillehammer said: "I would like to carve a beautiful pipe for Stalin." A wine maker from Bouchoux, France (a former guerrilla), told me: "We have saved the best bottles of wine for Stalin, maybe one day he will taste our wine." In Rome, an enthusiastic young man said to me: "Please remember to convey the bricklayers' respect to Stalin." Another interrupted him and said: "You shouldn't bother him, he is the only one who thinks about all of humanity."
    Today, people are sending Stalin gifts one after another. A French woman whose daughter was shot by the fascists sent Stalin the only souvenir she had preserved—a soft hat. No one else would receive such a gift. And there is no deeper love in the world.

　　伟大的感情
    爱伦堡
    在外国，言语既不通，风士人情又生疏，然而，我却曾不止一次地突然看见一个熟识的脸孔，于是，一切都变得熟识而且明白易解了。有一次，我前往北极圈内的瑞典城市基鲁纳。那儿的各种事物都使我惊异：拉伯兰人的驯鹿夹杂在汽车丛里，少女娴雅殷勤，而绅士们戴着高顶圆帽。于是我想：这一切是多么不可思议呵！随后，我被邀至一家人家，在那儿，我看见墙上挂着一幅画：斯大林穿着大衣迈开阔步。我微笑了，而我那沉默寡言的主人（矿工联合会书记）也微笑了。他爱抚地说：“斯大林”。
    我听见马德里的青年男女在攀登瓜达拉马山时频频呼唤着这个名字。“斯大林”，这个字眼也许就是他们在他们那短促的生命中说出来的最后一个字眼了——他们说着这个字眼奔赴战场。我在阿尔巴尼亚的荒僻村庄里，也听见过同样的这个字眼。这位穿着大衣的谁都熟识的人，也曾经到过那儿。他也访问过辽远的美洲，在有着棉花、黑人和不幸的密士失必河畔，我走进一间小屋里——铺着各色破布的朴素的桌子，光秃秃的墙——没有一幅图画或镜子，但却有一幅小照片。黑人指给我看，他说：“这是斯大林。”这个名字是个口令，它摧毁了阴险的人所树立的一堵堵的墙；而且，在这幅小小的照片之下，黑人生平第一次地拥抱着白人，把白人当作朋友……。
    斯大林周游全世界：当年青的中国人民解放古老的北京时，他们看见了他。他访问印度的牢狱，对被判定死罪的囚徒说出亲挚的激励的话。他穿着他的大衣，沿着全世界的一切道路行走。这些道路当中，有着使每个苏联人的心永志不忘的一些道路：斯摩林斯克州和白俄罗斯的道路，乌克兰和立陶宛的道路，奥勒尔、库尔斯克和佛罗内兹的道路，被炸弹与炮弹弄得凸凹不平的道路，被坦克碾平而且浸透了同志鲜血的、使人心肺俱裂的战争的道路，斯大林和士兵们一起沿着这一切道路前进。当他们沉默的时候（他们的心痛苦得麻木了），他也沉默，他和他们一起高唱军歌，从污泥中把炮拖起，并且建造起桥梁，他和他们一起坐在隆冬微弱的篝火旁边，游泳过河，在渡船上，在浮桥上，在帐幕里，他援救伤者，四出侦察，而且最先进入柏林的头一条街道。当法国的先头部队解放里茅辛（按在法国西南部）市镇时，他也和他们在一起。他和斯洛伐克的游击队一块儿进入班斯卡·彼斯特里加。他是浩浩大军的总司令，他草拟致胜的计划，详细策画每一个战役，他的眼睛审视着参谋本部的地图，同时，他又是一个普通士兵，他的足迹踏遍了许多道路，和一切人民共同受苦，备尝艰辛，又和一切人民一同获得胜利。
    最近我曾到过罗马。和平拥护者——十万罗马居民在黄昏时分聚集在宽阔的广场上。人们用各种不同的语言发表演说；工人们燃起了火炬，我便看见了古罗马拉脱伦族议事厅的墙壁上挂着的斯大林像。闪烁不定的温暖的火光，照明了那个熟识的脸孔。人们得着鼓励回家去了；他们晓得斯大林会保卫和平。
    住在伏尔加河和恒河河畔，住在罗亚尔河与亚马逊河河畔的亿万普通人民的信仰，都和斯大林的形象联结在一起……。
    现在，世界各国正纷纷送给斯大林各式各样的礼物：最精良的手稿、刺绣、油画、地毡。有一件礼物是骤眼看来似乎是不可理解的泥土。法国须累内的工人从占领者枪杀共产党人的地方——瓦勒累恩山要塞包起一把泥土，一把浸透了最优秀的人的鲜血的泥土，送给斯大林。枪杀是在破晓时进行的，那时，给万物以生命力的和煦的阳光，正开始从东方照射出来，这些人们在他们生命最后的一刻，曾不止一次地呼唤着这个他们所热爱着的伟大的名字。
    计划着另一次罪恶滔天的大屠杀的美国战略家们，正在计算师团的数目，计算成千成万架轰炸机和一堆堆的炸弹的数目。他们当中有些人说：空军决定一切。其他那些比较谨慎的人，便思量着豢养和武装欧洲的附庸。然而，到底是什么东西抑制住这些疯子呢？不仅仅是我国广袤的面积，不仅仅是各国人民对我们的兄弟般的感情，不仅仅是我们军队的威力和我们科学家的成就，而且还有人们对那些家伙的可耻结局的记忆，这些家伙恃其暂时的技术优越而出其不意地进攻我们，他们被苏联人民所筑成的血肉长城，被我国人民的精神力量，被斯大林的刚毅、意志与力量碰得焦头烂额。
    斯大林格勒是第二次世界大战的转捩点，这绝非“偶然”。苏联人民不能把这个城市让给敌人，因为它既是前线的神经枢纽，又是斯大林的城。历史上绝对没有什么偶然事件。法西斯主义被扑灭不是偶然的；而历史的新纪元之由俄罗斯工人揭开，而不是由美国吹牛的文人揭开，也不是偶然的。
    欧洲各国大大小小的城镇里有许多通衢、林荫路、街道与广场，都以斯大林格勒命名。这样，由于他们自己的地址或者是他们朋友的地址是这样命名的，这些记得是谁把他们从法西斯奴役之下拯救出来的人民，便在他们的日常生活里屡屡呼唤着这个伟大的名字。在里茅辛的一个村庄里，农民把他们仅有的一条街道命名为“斯大林格勒”，而这一村庄的这条街道，也许要比各大城市的通衢大道更加雄辩地表达出各国人民的感情。
    斯大林是千百万普通人民的知己。我曾屡次看到这种真挚的热爱之流露。里勒查谟一个年老的娜威人说：“我愿意为斯大林雕刻一个精美绝伦的烟斗。”法国布舒的一个酿酒者（过去的游击队员）告诉我说：“我们把最好的几瓶酒给斯大林留了下来，也许他有一天会尝到我们的酒的。”在罗马，热情的青年曾对我说：“请记着向斯大林转达砌砖工人的敬意。”另一个却打断他的话说：“你不该打扰他，他是仅有的一个为全体人类着想的人。”
    今天，人们正在纷纷给斯大林送礼。女儿被法西斯分子枪杀了的一个法国妇女，把她保存下来的唯一的一件纪念品——一顶软帽，送给斯大林。绝没有谁会接到这样的礼物的了。而且，世界上再也没有这样深厚的热爱了。
