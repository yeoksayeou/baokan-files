　　“The Birth of New China”
    Li Ling
    “The Birth of New China” is the fifth production of the Beijing Film Studio. Before the main feature, there are brief reports on Ambassador Roschin's visit to China and the People's Sports Congress of the Summer School. The main feature includes everything from the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the founding of the People's Republic of China, celebrations across the country, and congratulatory telegrams from around the world. Peace-loving people all over the world are rejoicing in the birth of new China. This shows that the new China is not isolated; it has many friends. In the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe also successively established diplomatic relations with us. This documentary records the great historical event that shocked the world; it is not an ordinary film.
    From the screen, everyone personally listened to Chairman Mao's speech. The people of the whole country and peace-loving people all over the world can clearly hear Chairman Mao's powerful words. In the scene where Chairman Mao announced the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st, followed by the scene of the artillery salute, we immediately thought of what Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Let the internal and external reactionaries tremble before us! Let them say that we cannot do this or that! The unyielding efforts of the Chinese people will steadily achieve their goals!"
    This film gives courage to the audience everywhere. On the screen, we can clearly see the infinitely powerful army of the new China. Although the navy and air force are under construction, we are confident that they will surely become the defense force of the new China. Especially when the troops are conducting a divisional parade, and the people's air force is flying in the sky over the people's capital, everyone warmly waves to them and cheers for them. These scenes of the masses cheering represent the excitement and enthusiasm of the people all over the country!
    “The Birth of New China” also fully demonstrates that the Chinese people are a great, brave, and hardworking nation. In celebrating the birth of their new country, they created various machines to participate in the parade. They are determined to transform an agricultural country into an industrial country. Especially the celebration held at the Shanghai Racecourse, a place that had been occupied by imperialists for many years, has returned to the embrace of the people. This further illustrates that this great, brave, and hardworking nation has stood up from now on, and they have broken free from the oppression and exploitation of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary governments to create their own cultural civilization and happiness.
    After watching the film "The Birth of New China," we cannot help but cheer to the new China: "Long live the new China!"

　　“新中国的诞生”
    李  灵
    “新中国的诞生”是北京电影制片厂的第五号出品。在正片之前有罗申大使来中国和暑期学园人民体育大会等简报。正片是包括了从人民政协的召开到中华人民共和国的成立，全国各地的庆祝情况以及国际拍来贺电，全世界爱好和平的人民都在为了新中国的诞生而欢欣鼓舞着。这说明了新的中国并不孤立，它有许多朋友，在以苏联为首的和平阵营里，苏联首先与中华人民共和国建立邦交，东欧的新民主主义国家也相继与我建立邦交。这部纪录片是把震惊了全世界的伟大史迹纪录下来了，他不是一部平常的影片。
    从银幕上人人都亲聆了毛主席的讲话。全国人民，全世界爱好和平的人民都能够清楚地听到了毛主席雄浑的语句。在十月一日毛主席宣布中华人民共和国成立的一个镜头，紧接着是鸣礼炮的镜头，使我们即时想起了毛主席在人民政协开幕词中所说的：“让那些内外反动派在我们面前发抖罢，让他们去说我们这也不行那也不行罢，中国人民的不屈不挠的努力将稳步地达到自己的目的！”
    这部影片处处都给予了观众们以勇气，在银幕上我们都清楚地看到了新中国无比强大的陆军，虽然海军和空军在新建，但是我们确信它一定会变成了新中国的国防力量，尤其是当部队进行分裂式的同时，在人民首都的天空飞翔着人民的空军，人人都向他热烈的招手，向他欢呼，这几个表现群众欢呼的镜头，也就代表了全国人民的兴奋与热情！
    “新中国的诞生”影片同时也充分地表现出中国人民是一个伟大的勇敢的勤劳的民族，他们在庆祝自己的新的国家诞生中，创造了各式各样的机器参加了游行的行列，他们有着把农业国改变成工业国的决心。尤其是在上海跑马厅举行了庆祝会，这块被帝国主义霸占了若干年的地方，它重新回到了人民的怀抱，这更说明了这个伟大勇敢而勤劳的民族从此站起来了，他们已挣脱外国帝国主义和国内反动政府的压迫和剥削来创造自己的文化明和幸福。
    看到了“新中国的诞生”影片后，不禁使我们向新中国欢呼：“新中国万岁！”
