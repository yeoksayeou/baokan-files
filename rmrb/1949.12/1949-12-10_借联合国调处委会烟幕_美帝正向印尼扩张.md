Using the UN Mediation Committee as a Smokescreen
　　US Imperialism is Expanding into Indonesia

　　The Dutch aggressors have no intention of withdrawing from Indonesia. Not only are they not withdrawing their troops, but they are also transporting in new forces.

　　Therefore, it is quite clear that the Hague Agreement is not intended to establish an independent and autonomous state in Indonesia, but to restore the old colonial rule there.

　　At this point, Manuilsky listed the facts of the Netherlands' violation of the Linggadjati Agreement concluded with the Republic of Indonesia on March 25, 1947, the violation of the so-called Renville Agreement concluded on January 17, 1948 (despite the fact that these agreements met all the main demands of the Netherlands that harmed the interests of the Indonesian people), and the resumption of operations on December 18, 1948, in an attempt to completely crush the Republic of Indonesia, and explained that the Dutch withdrawal was not credible.

　　Manuilsky said that due to these unscrupulous actions of the Dutch government, the Republic of Indonesia has actually shrunk to only the Special Region of Yogyakarta, lost large areas of territory, and become one of the sixteen states of the so-called United States of Indonesia. The other fifteen states, like the Republic led by the Hatta group, are puppet organizations established by the Netherlands.

　　Manuilsky then emphasized that the so-called United Nations Indonesia Committee, composed of representatives from the United States, Belgium, and Australia, played a role in helping the Dutch aggressors suppress the Indonesian people's liberation movement. He said: As is well known, the notorious Renville Agreement was the result of this committee's great pressure. When negotiations were taking place on the American warship "Renville," the committee did nothing to stop the Dutch offensive. It is quite clear that all these negotiations and consultations are just a smokescreen to cover up the treacherous actions of the Dutch aggressors. In fact, under the guise of mediation by this committee, the United States began to expand into Indonesia, trying to pave the way for seizing Indonesia's oil deposits and rubber plantations through the Dutch aggressors. According to materials published in the Dutch Forward newspaper on January 29, 1949, of the total foreign investment of 2.3 billion US dollars in Indonesia, the United States accounted for 1 billion US dollars. The Dutch aggressors and American companies such as Goodyear, US Rubber, Mobil, General Motors, and Goodrich Rubber are all in cahoots. Therefore, with the support of Dutch colonialists and the help of Indonesian feudal elements, American monopoly capitalists have become involved in this richest region in the world, making the Indonesian people live a miserable life under the colonial rule restored by the strength of foreign bayonets.

　　Finally, based on the Security Council's resolution on the Indonesian issue, Manuilsky suggested that the General Assembly adopt his five-point proposal on the Indonesian issue.

### 借联合国调处委会烟幕　美帝正向印尼扩张

　　借联合国调处委会烟幕
  　美帝正向印尼扩张
    荷兰侵略者不打算自印尼撤退。他们现在不但没有撤退他们的军队，并且正在增运新的部队。
    因此，十分明白，海牙协议不是要在印尼建立一个独立自主的国家，而是要恢复那里旧的殖民地统治。
    至此，曼努意斯基列举了荷兰破坏一九四七年三月二十五日与印尼共和国缔结的林牙椰蒂协定、破坏一九四八年一月十七日缔结的所谓伦维尔协定（尽管这些协定满足了荷兰一切损害印尼人民利益的主要要求），并于一九四八年十二月十八日恢复作战以图完全粉碎印尼共和国的事实，并说明荷兰撤军的不能令人相信。
    曼努意斯基说，由于荷兰政府这些毫无信义的行动，印尼共和国实际上已缩小到只有日惹特别区，丧失了大块领土，成为所谓印尼合众国的十六个邦之一，而其他的十五个邦，也正如哈达集团所领导的共和国一样，乃是荷兰所成立的傀儡组织。
    曼努意斯基随即着重指出，由美、比、澳三国代表组成的所谓联合国印尼委员会，起了帮助荷兰侵略者镇压印尼人民解放运动的作用。他说：如所周知，臭名远扬的伦维尔协定，就是这个委员会大施压力的结果。当谈判正在美国军舰“伦维尔”号上进行时，这个委员会一点也不制止荷兰的进攻。十分清楚，所有这些谈判与会商，都只是遮盖荷兰侵略者背信行动的烟幕而已。实际上，在这个委员会调处的假面具之下，美国开始向印尼实行扩张，竭力想通过荷兰侵略者来铺平夺取印尼的油藏和橡树园的道路。根据一九四九年一月二十九日荷兰前进报刊载的材料，外国在印尼总计二十三亿美元的投资中，美国占十亿美元。荷兰侵略者与美国的固特异公司、美国橡胶公司、美孚公司、通用汽车公司、固特立橡胶公司等美国公司，是一鼻孔出气的。因此，美国独占资本家在荷兰殖民者的支持与印尼封建分子的帮助之下，染指于这个世界上最富饶的地区，使印尼人民在借着外国刺刀力量而复辟的殖民地统治下，过着凄惨的生活。
    最后，曼努意斯基从安理会对印尼问题的决议出发，建议联大通过他提出的关于印尼问题的五点提案。
