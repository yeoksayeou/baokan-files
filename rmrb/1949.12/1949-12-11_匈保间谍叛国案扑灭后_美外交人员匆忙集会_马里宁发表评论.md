Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* commentator Malinin recently commented on the so-called "regional conference" of foreign diplomatic personnel, saying: According to news from American newspapers, the central issue at all these conferences is "promoting a cold war strategy."

The issues discussed at the Eastern European regional meeting of American diplomatic personnel are already well known. This meeting was convened shortly after the trial of the Rajk-Brankov spy case in Budapest. This trial, as well as the indictment of the Kostov spy case in Bulgaria, shows that the destructive espionage center of American diplomatic personnel and the Yugoslav fascists operating under their supervision are carrying out the notorious "Plan X" not only in Hungary but also in all people's democratic countries. The author of this plan is the warmonger John Foster Dulles. Its essence is to organize criminal conspiracies, terror and sabotage against the people's democratic system, establish the American-Yugoslav fifth column, and prepare for imperialist armed intervention. Therefore, after the Budapest trial and the cracking of a large number of spy sabotage centers in other people's democratic countries, it is understandable that American diplomatic personnel in the Eastern European region hurriedly discussed the best methods and new policies for covering up their crimes, because "Plan X" has been exposed and has failed shamefully.

No matter how closely the State Department guards its secrets, it cannot hide the reasons for the regional meeting of American diplomatic personnel in the Near East and Middle East countries. Under the smoke screen of the so-called "aid to backward areas" plan, the United States is carrying out frenzied activities to further enslave the countries of the Near East and Middle East politically and economically, and turn them into American military springboards. At the same time, the American imperialists are also trying to drive their "young brother," Britain, from its important political, economic, and strategic positions.

As soon as the US State Department announced the convening of a meeting of American diplomatic personnel in the Far East region, the British government hurriedly arranged a so-called conference of representatives of the British Commonwealth countries. Undoubtedly, the central issue at these meetings will be discussing strategies on how to fight against the rising tide of the people's liberation movement in Asian and Australian countries. But at the same time, the American imperialists have set a task for their diplomatic personnel - to ensure rapid expansion in all countries where British imperialism still has great influence. This is the nature of imperialist "cooperation." Whenever it involves new aggression and suppression of the freedom and independence of various countries, the American and British imperialists act together. But in other cases, they will cut each other's throats. They are partners and enemies. The world will still see more than one duel between them.

　　匈保间谍叛国案扑灭后
  　美外交人员匆忙集会
  　马里宁发表评论
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报评论家马里宁顷评论国外交人员的所谓“区域会议”称：根据美国报纸的消息：所有这些会议上的中心问题，都是“促进冷战战略”。
    东欧区域美国外交人员会议所曾讨论的问题，已属人所共知。这个会议是在布达佩斯的拉伊克——布兰科夫间谍案审判之后不久召开的。这个审判以及保加利亚的科斯托夫间谍案的起诉说明，美国外交人员以及在他们监督下活动的南斯拉夫法西斯分子破坏性的间谍中心，不仅在匈牙利而且也在一切人民民主国家中进行着臭名昭彰的“Ｘ计划”。这一计划的作者，就是战争贩子约翰·杜勒斯。其要领是组织反对人民民主制度的犯罪阴谋、恐怖与破坏，成立美国的南斯拉夫第五纵队，以及为帝国主义的武装干涉进行准备。因此，在布达佩斯审讯以及其他人民民主国家破获大批间谍破坏中心以后，东欧区美国外交人员就连忙讨论关于掩盖他们罪行的最好方法和新方针的问题，这是很可以理解的，因为“Ｘ计划”已被揭破并已可耻地失败了。
    不管国务院怎样严守秘密，它也掩盖不了近东与中东国家美国外交人员举行区域会议的原因。在所谓“援助落后地区”计划的烟幕之下，美国正在进行狂热的活动，要在政治上和经济上进一步奴役近东和中东的国家，并把它们变为美国的军事跳板。与此同时，美帝国主义者并力图把他们的“小伙计”——英国，从它的重要的政治、经济与战略阵地上赶出去。
    美国国务院刚一宣布召开远东区美国外交人员的会议，英政府就连忙布置所谓不列颠联邦各国的代表会议。无疑地，这些会议上的中心问题，将是讨论如何与亚洲及澳洲国家的人民解放运动的日益高涨作斗争的策略。但与此同时，美帝国主义者又为他们的外交人员确定了一项任务——保证在一切英帝国主义仍有很大势力的国家内迅速扩张。这就是帝国主义的“合作”的性质。每当涉及新的侵略以及镇压各国的自由与独立的事情时，美英帝国主义者就一齐进行。但在其它的情况下，它们就彼此都要割断对方的喉咙。它们是伙计又是敌人。世界仍然会看见它们之间不止一次的决斗。
