　　Northwest Steel Company's Iron Smelting Department No. 1 Furnace
    Sets New Daily Production Record of 80 Tons
    Invention of Iron Mold Casting Improves Iron Smelting Quality
    [Our Dispatch] The Iron Smelting Department of Taiyuan Northwest Steel Company has pioneered a new production record. No. 1 furnace now produces more than 80 tons of pig iron per day, and the quality standard has also been improved. After the liberation of the company, thanks to the efforts of the employees of the Iron Smelting Department, the output has reached more than 50 tons per day. Subsequently, the company put forward the production task for November and demanded that a record of 80 tons per day be achieved. New requirements were also put forward for the quality standards of open-hearth pig iron. After receiving the task, the leadership of the Iron Smelting Department arranged and inspected the work, repaired the machinery and equipment; at the same time, it launched mass brewing discussions. After the duty engineer carefully studied and mastered the temperature, coordinated raw materials, the trade union went deep into the grassroots to assist the work, and every employee strived to achieve the goal of producing 80 tons of iron per day. After half a month of efforts, the output finally increased to 80.19 tons on the 16th. By the 23rd, the average daily output had created a new record of 81.81 tons in eight days. The quality of open-hearth iron has also been improved compared to before. Moreover, after joint research by workers and engineers, the invention of iron mold casting can remove the sand attached to pig iron (in the past, sand mold casting was used, and a lot of sand was adhered to the pig iron, which was most likely to damage the bottom of the steelmaking furnace), which has a great effect on improving the production of the steelmaking plant. They are now continuing to study how to consolidate this glorious achievement, protect the furnace, and further increase production.

　　西北钢铁公司炼铁部一号炉
    创日产八十吨新纪录　　           
    发明铁模铸造炼铁质量提高
    【本报讯】太原西北钢铁公司炼铁部，首创生产新纪录，一号炉日产生铁八十余吨，质量标准也提高了一步。该公司解放后，在炼铁部员工的努力下，产量已达日产五十余吨。接着该公司提出十一月份的生产任务，并要求达到日产八十吨纪录。并对平炉生铁的质量标准也提出新要求。炼铁部接到任务后，领导上一方面进行布置和检查，修理了机器设备；一方面即展开群众性的酝酿讨论。经过值班工程师细心研究掌握热度，配合原料，工会深入下层协助工作，和每个员工都为争取日产八十吨铁的目标奋斗。经过半月的努力，终于在十六日产量提高到八○．一九吨，至二十三日八天中，平均每日产量创造了八一．八一吨的新纪录。平炉铁质量也较前提高。又经过工人和工程师一起研究，发明了铁模铸造，可以去掉附在生铁上砂子（过去是用砂模铸造，生铁上黏附许多砂子，最易损坏炼钢炉底），对提高炼钢厂生产起着极大作用。现正继续研究如何巩固这一光荣成绩，保护好炉子，进一步提高生产。
