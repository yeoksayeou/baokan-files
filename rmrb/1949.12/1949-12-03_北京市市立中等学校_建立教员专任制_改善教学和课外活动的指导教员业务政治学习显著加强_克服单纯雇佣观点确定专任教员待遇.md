　　Beijing Municipal Secondary Schools Establish a System of Full-Time Teachers

　　Improve Teaching and Guidance of Extracurricular Activities; Teachers' Professional and Political Learning Significantly Strengthened

　　Overcome the Purely Employment Perspective; Determine the Treatment of Full-Time Teachers

　　[This Newspaper] The system of full-time teachers has been initially established in Beijing's municipal secondary schools. According to statistics from November, in 13 out of the 16 municipal schools, full-time teachers accounted for more than 50% of the total number of teachers in each school. In the Ninth Middle School, this proportion reached 100%, while in the Fourth Girls' Middle School, which had the lowest proportion, it reached 35%. Due to the implementation of the full-time system, the teaching and guidance of students' extracurricular learning in various schools have been greatly improved. At the same time, the professional and political learning of the teachers themselves has also been significantly strengthened. The Municipal Education Bureau and school leaders are currently studying how to further implement the full-time teacher system to make it sound and solid.

　　In the past, under the long-term reactionary destruction of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, the lives of teachers fell into extreme poverty. Therefore, the phenomenon of teachers concurrently teaching in multiple schools was very common and serious. Leaving aside certain private schools that were solely profit-oriented, even in the case of the Fourth Municipal Middle School, out of 40 teachers in the school, 25 were concurrently teaching in other schools, accounting for 62.5%. Some teachers taught in six schools, working 42 hours a week, averaging seven hours of work per day. They were exhausted all day long, and the efficiency of teaching was naturally low. One teacher recalled the past situation and said: "At that time, when I got to the sixth or seventh period, I was really exhausted, and I didn't want to move my tongue. I couldn't wait to get out of class to breathe a sigh of relief. Sometimes, in order to rush to school, I had to dismiss class a few minutes early at School A and arrive a few minutes late at School B. As for the so-called teaching effect, God knows. In this situation, preparing lessons before class and guiding students to study on their own after class was something I didn't even dare to think about. Whenever the term exams came, the papers were piled high, who had time to look at them? The school urged for gradebooks tightly, so I just randomly marked the students, everyone passed, the students were all happy, and my teaching performance seemed excellent. Thinking about it today, it was really irresponsible."

　　After liberation, the government encountered many difficulties in this area during the rectification work. For example, it was simply impossible for the school to hold a meeting of all faculty and staff to arrange a task. Teachers left immediately after class, rushing to other schools to make their hours, either you were absent or I didn't come. As for conducting ideological education for students through teachers and implementing a system of combining teaching and guidance, it was impossible to talk about. Secondly, the teaching affairs office also found it very difficult to schedule classes: because the teachers' free hours were mutually constrained by various schools. School A occupied the reasonable time, and School B had to arrange it under unreasonable conditions. As a result, the teaching affairs office passively accommodated the actual situation of the teachers. Therefore, doing gymnastics and music in the morning, and algebra and geometry in the afternoon, these phenomena that violated teaching principles were everywhere. In addition, matters such as teachers' political learning, organizing discussion groups, and guiding extracurricular activities, thereby improving students' cultural and ideological levels, could not be proposed or implemented under the condition that the phenomenon of concurrently teaching was not corrected.

　　Therefore, in order to rectify school order, improve teachers' political and professional level, and establish new type of standardized schools, it is necessary to correct this phenomenon of concurrently teaching and strictly implement the full-time system.

　　After the government proposed the implementation of the full-time system, some people said: "The full-time system is indeed good, no one has any reason to oppose it, but how easy is it to implement!" Because in the past period of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, this was something that no one dared to do or could do, especially in the Beijing area, the four major types of schools—national, provincial, municipal, and private—were complex in nature and had inconsistent systems. The "three hideouts" policy of some concurrently teaching teachers could not be investigated. Even more people calculated for the government: "full-time" would certainly be an insurmountable difficulty in terms of teachers. Therefore, at the beginning of the government's implementation, it fully estimated such difficult conditions. At the same time, it also had sufficient understanding and confidence in the favorable conditions for implementing this system today. The steps and progress of the government in promoting this system are as follows:

　　First, conduct ideological preparation and investigation work, and step by step correct the purely employment viewpoints such as "just eat rice and sell hours" existing among teachers. Point out that today, being a people's teacher should establish a worldview of serving the people. From the government's call for on-the-job cadres to study after liberation to the holding of summer vacation faculty and staff study sessions, a preliminary foundation was gradually laid for this idea in the middle. Therefore, before the start of this semester, once the call for the full-time system was issued, teachers Liu Jingkun, Ma Wenyuan, Zhang Zie, Bai Jie, and others from the Fourth Middle School responded first, stating that "starting from the next semester, they resolutely want to voluntarily give up concurrently teaching and concentrate all their time and energy in one school, voluntarily working as a full-time teacher in the Fourth Municipal Middle School."

　　Secondly, appropriately adjust the treatment of full-time teachers. The Education Bureau stipulates the following general full-time treatment: 1. A Chinese teacher teaching three classes is considered full-time; 2. For other subjects, 20 hours in junior high school and 18 hours in senior high school are considered one full-time teacher; 3. Appropriate regulations have been made for the salary and rice of full-time teachers. In addition, in order to avoid egalitarianism in treatment and to take care of full-time teachers who have excellent teaching performance and a certain reputation, it can be proposed in a democratic evaluation manner, reviewed by the bureau, and given special supplementary awards.

　　Finally, in order to take care of the economic difficulties of general private middle schools, the government only made general appeals from the perspective of teaching efficiency and did not make a unified mandatory decision. Starting from this semester, it will only be implemented on a trial basis in general municipal middle schools step by step. After the start of this semester, due to the late enrollment of worker children's classes, some school leaders, in order to save trouble and convenience, had a phenomenon of full-time teachers concurrently teaching more classes in their own schools. Therefore, in September, the Education Bureau held another adjustment meeting to make appropriate corrections. The full-time system has been basically established in public city schools and has achieved great results (see the Fourth Middle School newsletter).

　　However, according to the feedback from various school authorities, some shortcomings still exist in the leadership and individual teachers' performance in some schools, for example:

　　A. Some teachers only passively wait outside of class, only answering questions when students come to ask, and even show a "killing time" phenomenon of having to wait in the lounge. Some teachers even retain the old habit of leaving immediately after class and being irresponsible.

　　B. Many teachers participate in too many unnecessary social activities, affecting their own tasks. Although the number of classes they teach each week is limited, most of the time is not spent on preparing lessons and guiding students to learn.

　　C. Some teachers' professional learning has not been established, and they are not serious enough in delving into the subject matter. The students' study groups have not been coordinated with the classes, and some have not used the groups to guide learning at all.

### 北京市市立中等学校  建立教员专任制　改善教学和课外活动的指导教员业务政治学习显著加强　克服单纯雇佣观点确定专任教员待遇

　　北京市市立中等学校建立教员专任制
  　改善教学和课外活动的指导教员业务政治学习显著加强
  　克服单纯雇佣观点　确定专任教员待遇
    【本报讯】北京市立各中等学校的教员专任制已初步建立，据十一月份统计，市立十六个学校中，有十三个学校的专任教员，已占各该校全部教员总数的百分之五十以上，九中则已达到百分之百，比例最小的女四中，也达到了百分之三十五。由于专任制的实行，使各校教学与指导学生课外学习大大改进，同时，教员本身的业务、政治学习也显著加强。现市教育局与各校领导上正研究更进一步的贯彻教员专任制，使之健全巩固。
    过去，在日寇以及国民党长期的反动摧残下，教员生活陷于极度的贫困，因此，中等学校的乱兼课现象是非常普遍和严重的，向以营利为目的的某些私立学校姑且不论，即以市立第四中学而言：全校四十位教员中，兼课教员就有二十五位之多，占百分之六二．五，有的教员兼到六个学校，每周到四十二个钟头，平均每天要任七小时的功课，整天在疲于奔命，授课效率自然要低。有一位教员回味着过去的情景，说：“那时一上到第六七节课，真是精疲力尽，舌头全不愿多动弹了，恨不得赶快下课，才松下一口气；有时为了赶学校，必须在甲校早下课几分钟，而到乙校又晚上几分钟，至于所谓教学效果，那真是天晓得。在这种情况下，课前预备功课以及在课外指导学生自习，那更是连想都不敢想的事。每逢期考到来，卷子堆得高高的，谁有功夫看？学校对积分簿催索得紧，便胡乱给学生划一阵，大家都及格，学生皆大欢喜，自己的教学成绩又显得优良出众。今天想来，那真是谈不到负责任的。”
    解放后，政府在整顿工作中，在这方面曾碰到了不少的困难。例如：学校为布置一项工作而召开一个全体教职员大会，简直是不可能的事。教员们下课就走，为了急着到别校赶钟点，不是你缺席、就是我不到；至于通过教员对学生进行思想教育，实行教导合一的制度，那更是无从谈起。其次如教导处排功课表，也是一大困难：因为教员们的空钟点各校互相牵制着，甲校把合理的时间占去，乙校便只有在不合理的条件下去安排，结果教导处完全被动地去迁就教员的实际情况，于是早上上体操和音乐，下午上代数和几何，这些违反教学原理的现象，所在皆是。此外，关于教员的政治学习，组织讨论会以及指导课外活动，从而提高学生的文化思想水平的事，在兼课现象不加纠正的条件下，是无法提出也无从实行的。
    因此，为了整顿学校秩序，提高教师的政治和业务水平，建立新型正规化的学校，必须纠正这一乱兼课现象，厉行专任制度。
    政府提出实行专任制后，曾有人这样说：“专任制度确是好，谁也没理由反对，但执行起来谈何容易！”因为在过去国民党的反动统治时期，这是没有人敢作也不能作的事，特别是在北京这一地区，国、省、市、私四大类型的学校，性质复杂，系统又不一致，某些兼课教员的“三窟”政策，是无法清查出来的。更有的人为政府计算：“专任”起来，师资一定是个无法克服的困难。因此，政府在实行之初，对于诸如此类的困难条件，都做了充分的估计，同时，对于今天实行这一制度的有利条件，也做了足够的认识而具有信心。政府推行这一制度的步骤和进程是这样的：
    首先，进行思想上的准备和调查工作，有步骤地纠正教员中存在的“混饭吃，卖钟点”等单纯的雇佣观点。指出在今天做一个人民教师，就应该建树为人民服务的人生观。从解放后政府号召在职干部学习开始，直到暑期教职员学习会的举行，中间逐步的为这一思想打下初步的基础。所以，在本学期开学前，专任制度的号召一发出，四中教员刘景昆、马文元、张子锷、白杰等便首先响应，表示“自下学期起，坚决的要自动放弃兼课，把所有的时间和精力，都集中在一个学校，自愿在市立四中作一个专任教员。”
    其次，适当地调整专任教员的待遇。教育局规定一般专任待遇是这样的：一、国文教员任课三班为一专任；二、其他功课以初中二十小时，高中十八小时为一专任教员；三、对专任教员的薪米作了适当的规定。此外，政府为了避免待遇上的平均主义偏向，照顾专任教员中教学成绩优良且有一定威望者，可以民主评议方式提出，由局方审核，给以特殊奖补。
    最后，为了照顾一般私立中学在经济上的困难，政府只从教学效率上做了一般的号召，并未做出统一的硬性决定。从本学期起，只是有步骤地先在一般市立中学开始试行。本期开学后，由于增招工人子弟班较晚，有的学校负责人为了省事方便，发生过专任教员在本校兼课较多的现象。所以，在九月间，教育局又召开过一次调整会议，作了适当的纠正，专任制度在公市学校中已基本上建立起来了，并已获得很大成绩（参看四中通讯）。
    但根据各校当局的反映，目前有些学校在领导上和个别教员的表现上，仍存在着某些缺点，例如：
    甲、有些教员在课外只是消极的等待着，有学生来问才解答问题，更有的在休息室里表现了不得不等的“熬时间”现象。甚至有些教员还存着下课就走不负责任的旧习惯。
    乙、不少教员参加不必要的社会活动过多，影响了自己本身的任务，虽然每周所任功课有限，但大部时间并未用在准备功课和指导学生学习上。
    丙、有些教员业务学习没有建立起来，认真钻研功课更是不够，学生的学习小组也没有和上课配合起来，有的完全没有利用小组去指导过学习。
