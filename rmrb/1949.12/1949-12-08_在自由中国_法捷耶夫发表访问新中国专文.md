Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, Moscow, 6th: Today, *Pravda* published a long article by Alexander Fadeyev, head of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific delegation that recently visited China, entitled "In Free China."

　　Fadeyev begins the article by describing the celebrations commemorating the founding of the People's Republic of China, citing many facts reflecting the Chinese people's heartfelt love for the Soviet Union. He writes that we will never forget how, in every town we visited, the voices of tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, thundered in praise of the great Stalin, shouting: "Long live Stalin!"

　　Fadeyev emphasized that the victory of the Chinese people, the way the people were mobilized to strive for this victory, the discipline and organization of the People's Army, the organizational methods of the new people's regime, and the organized nature of the demonstrations and gatherings of millions of people who had gained a new life all demonstrated the ideological, political, and organizational experience accumulated by the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Fadeyev continued: We were in daily contact with the most advanced representatives of the Chinese people and often heard them express the opinion that the existence of socialist Soviet Union as China's neighbor, the brilliance of the great doctrines of Lenin and Stalin, the entire revolutionary and organizational experience accumulated by our party and our people, and our brotherly love for the Chinese people encouraged the Chinese democratic forces to struggle and made it easier for them to achieve victory.

　　This is what millions of the most simple and sincere Chinese people know and feel. This explains why the Soviet cultural delegation was surrounded by such great love everywhere during its six-week trip to China.

　　Turning to the main things happening in China now, Fadeyev continued: This main thing can be summed up in one sentence: China is building a people's state and is seeking knowledge.

　　People's China inherited a backward economy. The rule of the imperialists and their lackeys (traitors who impoverished the people while lining their own pockets by selling out national interests) hindered the development of China's economy. People's China is striving to eliminate all vestiges of feudalism, first and foremost by fully implementing land reform, which means handing over the landlords' estates to the peasants.

　　People's China is striving to develop industry, especially all state-owned industries. Under the people's democratic conditions in which the working class holds a leading position, the working class is increasing labor productivity and is increasingly demonstrating outstanding acts of labor heroism in transportation and the coal mining industry.

　　Chinese peasants, who for centuries have had barely enough to eat from one day to the next, have realized that only by forming an alliance with the working class and under its leadership can they obtain a decent life. The peasants formed this alliance with the working class in the course of the people's revolution. The Chinese Communist Party has won unlimited prestige among the peasants.

　　The great gains made by the people's regime in China and the gains made by the Chinese Communist Party mean that the vast majority of democratic intellectuals support the new China. Take the ranks of Chinese educators, for example, who selflessly dedicate all their energy to the cause of educating the people.

　　The Chinese people have never been so eager for knowledge. Reading rooms, libraries, lecture halls, and music halls, theaters and museums are all crowded with people. Soviet cultural workers have spoken many times to large audiences composed of people from all walks of life, and we have always been deeply moved, not only by the extremely earnest attention of our audiences, but also by their efforts to draw practical experience from everything and apply it to the new life in China. They asked us tens of thousands of questions, asking us to tell them about every aspect of Soviet cultural life.

　　One feels that the Chinese people and their intellectuals are wholeheartedly striving for the future, that they are deeply convinced of their future and are prepared to create it with their own hands. One can boldly call Chinese writers the vanguard of intellectuals. A characteristic of the development of modern Chinese literature is that writers who are today considered representatives of the older generation, such as Guo Moruo or Mao Dun, have been with the people since their youth. Now, Chinese literature is created by writers who come from the people, and the main protagonists in literary works are the people of the new China, the soldiers, and the people who are transforming society.

　　The People's Revolution has influenced the development of all fields of Chinese art. Alongside the old classical drama and its traditions, a new realistic drama is emerging.

　　Fadeyev concluded that the epoch-making significance of the changes taking place in China has created an inexhaustible source of creativity in all aspects of human activity. The Chinese nation has leaped into the ranks of the most advanced nations in the world.

　　The bourgeois fools of Western Europe and the United States have not yet realized what is actually happening in China.

　　Fadeyev mocked, saying that the wicked man living in a remote area cannot understand what kind of laughingstock history has turned him into—indeed, how can one compare the powerful pulse of the new life in China (where one seems to hear the breath of history itself) with the lifeless, hopeless life of the moribund European Marshallized countries?

　　Great China, with its 500 million people, has begun an epoch-making movement, the ultimate goal of which is socialism and communism. It would do no harm for the imperialist gentlemen and their ideological servants to recall the prediction made by Comrade Stalin as early as 1925. Comrade Stalin said: "The forces of the Chinese revolutionary movement are immeasurable, and they have not yet truly manifested themselves. They will manifest themselves in the future. It will be bad for the rulers of the East and the West who close their eyes to this force and do not take it into account appropriately."

### 在自由中国　法捷耶夫发表访问新中国专文

　　在自由中国
  　法捷耶夫发表访问新中国专文
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报今日刊登最近访问中国的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团长亚历山大。法捷耶夫的长文，题为“在自由中国”。
    法捷耶夫在文章开头时描写纪念中华人民共和国成立的庆祝会，援引许多反映的中国人民衷心热爱苏联的事实。他写道，我们永不会忘记在每一个我们访问过的城镇中几万几十万人的声音怎样雷动欢呼光荣归于伟大的斯大林，高呼：“斯大林万岁！”
    法捷耶夫强调指出：中国人民的胜利，动员人民争取这一胜利的方式，人民军队的纪律与组织，新人民政权的组织方式，以及千百万得到新生活的人民举行示威与集会的有组织的状况，在在说明了中国共产党累积的思想、政治和组织方面的经验。
    法捷耶夫继称：我们与中国人民的最先进的代表每天都接触，常常听到他们表示这样意见，说作为中国邻邦的社会主义苏联的存在，列宁与斯大林的伟大学说的光芒，我们党和我们人民累积的整个革命的与组织方面的经验及我们对中国人民的兄弟般的友爱，鼓励了中国民主力量进行斗争，并使他们比较容易取得胜利。
    这就是中国的千百万最质朴的人民都知道和感觉到的东西。这说明了苏联文化代表团在历时六周的中国旅行中为什么到处受到非常的热爱的包围。
    在谈到中国现在发生的主要事情时，法捷耶夫继续说：这一主要事情可以用一句话来概括：中国正在建设人民的国家，正在求知识。
    人民的中国继承了一份落后经济。帝国主义者及其奴仆（使人民陷于贫困，自己却满腰包的反动派出卖民族利益的卖国贼们）的统治，使中国经济的发展受到阻碍。人民的中国正在努力消灭封建残余的一切残迹，首先是充分实行土地改革，这就是说把地主的田庄交给农民。
    人民中国正在努力发展工业，首先是一切国营工业。在工人阶级根据权利占有领导地位的人民民主的条件下，工人阶级正在提高劳动生产率，并且正在运输业与煤矿业中越来越经常地表现出卓越的劳动英雄主义的业迹。
    千百年来可怜地无隔宿之粮的中国农民认识到，只有和工人阶级结成联盟并在其领导之下，他们才能得到象样的生活。农民是在人民革命的进程中和工人阶级缔成了这一联盟的。中国共产党已在农民中博得无限的威信。
    人民政权在中国获得的巨大收获，中国共产党所获得的收获就是绝大多数民主的知识分子阶层都拥护新中国。拿中国的教育工作者队伍作例子吧，他们忘我地把全部精力贡献给教育人民地事业上。
    中国人民以前从来没有这样地渴求过知识。阅览室、图书馆、讲演堂和音乐堂，戏院和博物馆全都挤满了人。苏联文化工作者曾多次向来自各个社会阶层的人们组成的大量听众演说，我们总是受到深深的感动，这不仅是由于我们的听众极为恳切的注意，而且由于他们从一切事物中努力汲取实际经验，并把这些经验运用到中国的新生活中去。他们向我们提出数以万计的问题，要求我们告诉他们苏联文化生活的每一方面。
    人们感到中国人民和他们的知识分子是全心全意为将来而努力的，感到他们深信他们的将来，并准备以他们自己的手来缔造它。人们可以大胆地把中国作家们叫作知识分子的先遣队。现代中国文学发展的特点是，今天已被算作老一辈人物之代表的作家们，例如郭沫若或茅盾，自从他们的青年时代起就一直和人民在一起。现在，创造中国文学的是从人民当中产生的作家们，成为文学作品中的主要主人公的是新中国的人民、战士和改造社会的人们。
    人民革命已经影响了中国艺术的一切领域内的发展。在旧的古典戏剧及其传统的旁边，新的现实主义的戏剧正在产生。
    法捷耶夫结语说，但主要的是，在中国所发生的变动的划时代的意义，已在人的活动的一切方面造成了人们创造性的无穷无尽的源泉。中国民族已一跃而跻身于世界上最先进民族之林。
    西欧与美国的资产阶级蠢才们还没有认识到，在中国实际上发生了些什么事。
    法捷耶夫嘲笑地说，住在偏僻地区的坏人，无法了解到，历史已经把他变成了一个什么样的笑柄——的确，人们如何能够把中国新生活的有力脉搏（在那里，人们似乎听到了历史自身的呼吸）和偏僻的欧洲马歇尔化国家的死气沉沉的、没有前途的生活拿来比较呢？
    拥有五万万人口的伟大的中国已经开始了一个划时代的运动，这个运动的最终目标是社会主义与共产主义。让帝国主义绅士们和他们在思想上的仆役们想起斯大林同志早在一九二五年就作过的预言吧，那对于他们是没有害处的。斯大林同志说：“中国革命运动的力量是不可衡量的，它们还没有真正地表现出来。它们要在将来表现出来。闭起眼睛不看这一力量并且不恰当地计算到这一力量的东方和西方的统治者们要吃苦头的。”
