    The Question of the Relationship Between Formal Logic and Materialist Dialectics
    Formal logic is the science of the laws of correct thinking. Its object is the laws of correct thinking, and correct thinking is free of contradiction, interconnected, consistent, well-founded, and leads to correct conclusions consistent with reality. Formal logic stipulates the necessary conditions for thought, regardless of the object of thought. Without following the laws of formal logic, thinking cannot be correct, cannot lead to correct conclusions, and cannot achieve understanding of reality. Following the laws of formal logic is a necessary condition for understanding reality, but merely following the laws of formal logic is not enough to understand reality.
    To correctly and completely understand reality, one must apply the only scientific method for exploring reality - the dialectical method, the materialist dialectical method.
    Materialist dialectics is the science of the universal laws of development of nature, society, and thought. Thus, materialist dialectics not only studies the laws of development of nature and society, but also the laws of development of thought. Therefore, the question of the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics arises, because the laws of thought are the object of study of both, and for formal logic this is the entire object, while for materialist dialectics it is only a part of the object. The question of this relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics also arises because formal logic and materialist dialectics are both means and "weapons" for understanding reality, serving the purpose of understanding reality and applying certain methods for understanding reality. The method of formal logic is different from the method of materialist dialectics, but both are applied in the process of understanding and exploring real phenomena.
    Thus, the question of the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics lies in: defining the scope of application of the laws of formal logic in the process of exploring and understanding reality with materialist dialectics.
    Bourgeois scholars, when studying the laws of nature, society, and thought, usually obliterate or directly deny the materialist dialectical method and apply the method of formal logic, only utilizing the laws of formal logic; in cases where they attempt to think dialectically, they understand dialectics idealistically rather than materialistically. Thus, in the research of bourgeois scholars, a distorted picture of reality is presented. In some cases, bourgeois scholars also reach correct conclusions in science, and this happens because the most conscientious among them involuntarily, unconsciously, and unknowingly apply the dialectical method, instinctively reaching dialectics in their research.
    Marxists think dialectically. For them, dialectics plays a leading role in their research; therefore, Marxist science - and Soviet science is Marxist science - is an advanced science that has achieved unprecedented prosperity and unprecedented results. However, science, thought, and research, when applying the materialist dialectical method, cannot ignore the laws of formal logic, because ignoring the laws of formal logic will cause errors in thinking and incorrect conclusions about various real phenomena.
    Clearly, the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics must be defined, and their differences and connections must be determined.
    Incorrectly resolving the question of the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics can lead to the most harmful and negative results, can lead to an incorrect understanding of reality, a distorted and misinterpreted explanation of reality, that is, not leading to truth, but leading to erroneous conclusions. Conversely, if this question is correctly resolved, it is possible to use the laws of formal logic as a means to improve our ideological work and help us understand reality.

    Dialectical Logic
    The dialectical method of cognition views natural and social phenomena as interconnected, eternally moving, and eternally changing, and the development of nature and society as the result of the interaction and struggle of opposing forces. The materialist dialectics created by Marx and Engels and developed and enriched by Lenin and Stalin is the science of the universal laws of development of nature, society, and thought. Engels, in his book "Dialectics of Nature," divides dialectics into objective dialectics and subjective dialectics. Objective dialectics dominates in nature. Objective dialectics is the development and movement of natural and social phenomena themselves, is the development caused by contradictions, by the transition from gradual quantitative changes to fundamental qualitative changes, that is, the dialectics of the development of objective reality, the objective world, nature, and society itself. Subjective dialectics is the reflection in human thought of the development that dominates the entire natural world due to contradictions and the struggle of opposing forces. Engels wrote: "So-called objective dialectics prevails throughout nature, while so-called subjective dialectics, dialectical thinking, is merely the reaction of the movement prevailing throughout nature, which is brought about by oppositions, and it is these oppositions which, by their constant struggle and their ultimately passing over into one another or into higher forms, determine the life of nature" (1).
    And elsewhere he wrote: "...the dialectic of the head is only the reflection of the forms of motion of the real world of nature and history" (2).
    Thus, we can clarify the relationship between objective dialectics and subjective dialectics in this way. Objective dialectics is the development itself of phenomena in the objective world - nature and society. Subjective dialectics is the reflection of this development in consciousness, in human thought, in our concepts and judgments. This subjective dialectics is also called dialectical logic. Because it is consistent with reality, it is the only scientific method for understanding reality.
    Marxist dialectics is classically defined in Comrade Stalin's work "Dialectical and Historical Materialism." In contrasting materialist dialectics with metaphysics, Comrade Stalin described the following four features of dialectics:
    "(1) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics does not regard nature as an accidental agglomeration of things, of phenomena, unconnected with, isolated from, and independent of, each other; but as a connected and integral whole, in which things, phenomena are organically connected with, dependent on, and determined by, each other...
    (2) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics holds that nature is not in a state of rest and immobility, of stagnation and immutability, but is in a state of continuous movement and change, of continuous renewal and development, where something is always arising and developing, and something always disintegrating and dying away...
    (3) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics does not regard the process of development as a simple process of growth, where quantitative changes do not lead to qualitative changes, but as a development which proceeds from imperceptible and gradual quantitative changes to open and fundamental changes, to qualitative changes; a development in which the qualitative changes occur not gradually, but rapidly and abruptly, taking the form of a leap from one state to another; they occur not accidentally but as the logical result of the accumulation of imperceptible and gradual quantitative changes...
    (4) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics holds that internal contradictions are inherent in things and phenomena of nature, for they all have their negative and positive sides, a past and a future, something dying away and something developing; and that the struggle between these opposites, the struggle between the old and the new, between that which is dying away and that which is being born, between that which is disintegrating and that which is developing, constitutes the internal content of the process of development, the internal content of the transformation of quantitative changes into qualitative changes" (3).
    Such is materialist dialectics as the science of the universal laws of the development of nature, society, and thought. By applying the materialist dialectical method, it is possible to understand real phenomena from the diversity of real phenomena, from their interconnections, from their changes and development, and to understand all the contradictions contained in reality that constrain the development of reality.

    The Laws and Methods of Formal Logic and the Laws and Methods of Materialist Dialectics
    The classic works of Marxism-Leninism clearly delineate the boundaries between formal logic and dialectical logic. Lenin wrote: "Formal logic...takes as its guide what is most ordinary or frequently encountered and confines itself to this...Dialectical logic demands that we go further. In order to really know an object, we must embrace, study all its sides, all connections and 'mediations'...That is the first point. Second, dialectical logic requires us to take an object in its development, in its 'self-movement' (as Hegel sometimes puts it), in its changes" (4).
    Two principles are clearly expressed here: (1) formal logic and dialectical logic are different sciences, and (2) formal logic is a lower stage of knowledge for dialectical logic.
    The formal logical method has different characteristics compared to the dialectical method. The characteristic of formal logic, which is based on the law of identity, the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the law of sufficient reason, is to examine objects or phenomena of reality in isolation from each other, to examine objects or phenomena of reality in a static state, and to exclude all contradictions that may occur in our judgments and inferences about real phenomena. It may give the impression that formal logic is incompatible with materialist dialectics, contradicts it, and is rejected by it. For a time, this view was very popular in our country, and therefore the scientific significance of formal logic was denied, and its right to exist as a science was denied. This view is wrong. Formal logic is not rejected by dialectics, it is merely placed in its proper position as a necessary condition for cognition or thought, but not as a condition that includes the entire process of cognition of reality. Bourgeois idealist philosophy often uses formal logic as the basis for metaphysical thinking, and relying on the laws of formal logic, excludes development, the new replacing the old, and the struggle of opposites from the examination of reality. This metaphysical attitude towards understanding reality is resolutely refuted by Marxism-Leninism, and Comrade Stalin has contrasted dialectics with metaphysics extremely clearly and unambiguously.
    Negating metaphysics does not mean negating formal logic; the classic works of Marxism-Leninism do not generally refute formal logic, but rather refute the metaphysical interpretation and utilization of formal logic.
    Formal logic can be applied without reservation within a certain scope of cognition, and its method is sufficient to reach correct conclusions. The scope of cognition in which the laws of formal logic are effective was defined by Engels for the sake of clarity and ease as the scope of "household affairs."
    "Household affairs" is a metaphorical and conditional term, which means the simple and ordinary relationships of things that people cannot but deal with in their daily practice, when the objects of our thought appear as things that have already been formed and do not change within a certain period of time, so for each object it can be said: it either is or is not, it has a certain attribute or does not have it, and so on.
    Lenin wrote about the "cells" of logic (i.e., the forms of reasoning): they express "the most ordinary relations of things" (5); "man's practice, repeated a billion times, becomes fixed in man's consciousness as logical categories" (6).
    Thus, dialectical logic reflects the movement and development of reality, reflects the struggle of opposites in reality, reflects the interconnection and interdependence of real phenomena, while formal logic reflects the simplest relationships of objects and phenomena, that is, those relationships in which objects and phenomena are examined according to the way they have been formed and determined at a certain time.
    It is completely legitimate to examine real phenomena in this way within a certain scope of cognition and at a certain stage of cognition, and it satisfies the purpose of understanding real phenomena, but in a broader scope and at a higher stage of cognition, this is not enough, and it is impossible to know the truth by merely following the laws of formal logic; here, dialectics must be applied.
    Engels used the relationship between elementary arithmetic and higher arithmetic as an example to clearly illustrate the relationship between formal logic and dialectics. Engels wrote in "Dialectics of Nature" about the "fixed" categories of formal logic: they "appear to be the elementary arithmetic of logic." (7) This means that formal logic is to dialectical logic as elementary arithmetic is to higher arithmetic. In "Anti-Dühring," Engels's thought is expressed as follows:
    "Even formal logic is primarily a method of arriving at new results, of advancing from the known to the unknown; and dialectics is the same, only in a much more important sense; moreover, it breaks through the narrow barrier imposed by formal logic, and contains the germ of a more comprehensive view of the world. The same relation obtains in mathematics. Elementary mathematics, the mathematics of constant magnitudes, moves, at least on the whole and in general, within the bounds of formal logic; the mathematics of variable magnitudes, the most important part of which is the infinitesimal calculus, is essentially an application of dialectics to mathematical relations" (8).
    Just as higher arithmetic, based on the application of dialectics, does not cancel or deprive elementary arithmetic, based on the application of formal logic, of its significance, dialectics does not cancel or deprive formal logic of its significance; the laws of formal logic fully retain their power within the scope of "constant magnitudes" and within the scope of simply defined objects and phenomena.
    When we have to count something or measure an area, we will do it according to the rules of elementary arithmetic, otherwise it cannot be done. Just imagine an accountant who uses higher arithmetic, which includes infinitesimals, variables, etc., to make financial calculations for an enterprise, and then we will understand how absurd it is to deny elementary arithmetic on the grounds that it does not include all quantitative relations and spatial forms. The same situation also occurs in the relationship between formal logic and dialectics. Dialectics examines real phenomena from the perspective of development, movement, connection, and interaction, which does not preclude the necessity of examining the simplest relationships of real phenomena, and does not preclude the necessity of regarding them as stable, definite, and separate phenomena within a specific period of time and under specific concrete conditions. Furthermore, any developing phenomenon can only be studied when we first separate and examine what is developing. The connection between various phenomena or objects can only be studied when we individually separate and examine what there is a connection between. The contradictory aspects of a phenomenon or object can only be studied when we first separate and examine what there is a contradiction between.
    The development, change, and struggle of opposites that are taking place throughout reality do not exclude a certain relative stability of phenomena, objects, or things within a specific period of time; everything is changing, but these changes are small, insignificant, and irrelevant for practical purposes for a certain period of time. These changes take place within the scope of not changing the quality until they reach a certain limit. Take a glass in your hand, is it changing or not changing? The glass is constantly changing: there may be some fingerprints on it, the glass may become dull, the use of the glass may change, etc. But for the time being, we have not broken the glass, and for the time being, we can still use it for a certain purpose. After all, it is still the same glass, and the changes that have taken place to it have no practical significance for us. These changes are insignificant and irrelevant. Therefore, regarding this glass, it cannot be said that it is glass and is not glass, it is transparent and is not transparent, it is large and is small, it is complete and is broken, etc.; regarding any of its attributes, according to the laws of formal logic, it cannot but be said: it is or is not (according to the formula: is - is not).
    That is to say, as long as an object maintains relative invariance within a specific period of time, then the four laws of thought - the law of identity, the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the law of sufficient reason - can be fully applied when examining this object. Regarding a person, we can say: he is either alive or dead. This is correct from the logical point of view based on the four laws of thought. But we know that there is a much more complex relationship between life and death than it seems at first glance. If we study life and death scientifically and dialectically, then we will clarify that although a person is now alive, the process of death has been going on in his body; when a person dies, the life processes in the body do not stop all at once. However, when we examine the issue of life and death of a person we know, it is important for us to clearly determine whether this person is dead or alive. For the question of whether this person is alive or dead, we can only answer either alive or dead, that is, answer according to the laws of formal logic; but it cannot be said: this person is neither alive nor dead, or he is both alive and dead. If a doctor answers the question of whether this person is alive or dead with yes and no, or neither yes nor no, that is, he violates the laws of formal logic, then this will be a mockery of common sense, and it sounds like the famous phrase "neither alive nor dead," which is used for a person who is so shocked that he is confused even about himself.
    Let's take another example. The concepts of morality are not always immutable; they are changing and developing with the development of society. At different stages of human development, the concepts of morality, the concepts of good, bad, good, and evil, are all different, just as these concepts are different for different classes - for exploiters and exploited - in the same era. Socialist morality is fundamentally different from bourgeois morality. Only by using the materialist dialectical method to examine morality from the connection between moral views and the sum of social material living conditions can we understand, study, and explain the development and changes of moral views. The dialectical method not only enables people to determine what is considered moral and commendable under certain social conditions, but is considered immoral and should be blamed under other conditions, but also enables people to scientifically explain these differences in moral views. But when we examine a specific behavior of a person under specific conditions, and want to distinguish this behavior and give it a moral evaluation, that is, decide whether this behavior is immoral or unethical - we should give a completely straightforward answer to this question - is or is not, that is, an answer according to the rules of formal logic, and we cannot avoid answering this question or give an ambiguous and vague answer - this is bad and also good. Here the answer should be definite - either, or not.
    Thus, within the scope of the simplest relationships of things and phenomena, the laws of formal logic are fully effective, and they are sufficient for understanding the relevant objects.
    However, at a higher stage of cognition, when the purpose of human thought is to understand reality from all the diversity of real phenomena, from all the complexity and contradictions of its development, to understand its regularity, and to reveal the connections and interdependence of phenomena, objects, or events - formal logic is not enough, and dialectical logic, materialist dialectics, must be applied here. But within this scope, in these stages of cognition where dialectics plays a dominant role, does formal logic lose its significance? Do the laws of formal logic lose their power? The answer to this question should be negative. According to Engels, dialectics breaks through the narrow boundaries of formal logic, but does not eliminate or abolish formal logic within the scope of relying on the application of the dialectical method to understand reality. Since the laws of formal logic are a necessary condition of human thought, they retain their power for dialectical thinking, but only as the simplest condition of dialectical thinking, because dialectical thinking obeys its own laws, and these laws are the reflection of the laws of development of reality, nature, and society in human consciousness.
    Dialectical thinking is not contradictory to the laws of formal logic. It is a complete distortion to say that dialectical thinking is illogical, and that it seems to violate the laws of formal logic. We must learn not only to apply the dialectical method from the greatest masters of dialectical thinking - Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin - but also to learn the strict logic in judgment and reasoning.
    Dialectical thinking reveals the contradictions in objective reality, reveals the struggle of opposing forces, and formal logic, under correct understanding, does not reject these contradictions at all. It only does not allow contradictory thoughts, does not allow contradictory arguments, and does not allow inferences and conclusions based on insufficient and inconsistent reasoning, and such thoughts, arguments, inferences, and conclusions are even more unacceptable in the field of dialectical thinking.
    To understand the specific relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics, we can cite a dialectical contradiction example at random in natural and social phenomena, and we can see in every case that this dialectical contradiction does not abolish the laws of formal logic at all. The following example can illustrate this point.
    Marxist-Leninist doctrine teaches that at a certain stage of social development, the state will wither away, and the state will be eliminated in a completely communist society, when society will no longer be divided into classes. Comrade Stalin, in his report to the 18th Congress of the Party, developed this theory of the withering away of the socialist state, and determined that the state will wither away only when capitalist encirclement is eliminated in the communist period (9). That is to say, the socialist state will wither away when appropriate conditions arrive. At the same time, the entire policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet regime is aimed at consolidating and strengthening the socialist state. Comrade Stalin spoke about this in the following passage in his report to the 16th Congress of the CPSU (B). (To be continued)

　　形式逻辑与唯物辩证法
    斯特罗果维契作  曹葆华、谢宁译
    （这篇文章是Ｍ·Ｃ·斯特罗果维契所著“逻辑”底单独一章。该书于一九四九年三月由苏联国立政治书籍出版局印行，为苏联最新的一本逻辑教程。——编者）
    形式逻辑与唯物辩证法相互关系问题底提出
    形式逻辑乃是关于正确思惟底规律的科学，它的对象是正确思惟底规律，而正确思惟是毫无矛盾、互相联系的、首尾一贯的、根据充足的，并且导引到正确的、与现实一致的结论。形式逻辑规定着思想底必要条件，无论思想底对象为何。不遵守形式逻辑底规律，思惟便不能正确，不能导引到正确的结论，不能达到对现实的认识。但是只遵循形式逻辑底规律，却不能保证对现实的认识。遵循形式逻辑底规律是对现实的认识之必要条件，但是仅仅遵循形式逻辑底规律，对于认识现实是不够的。
    要正确而完整地认识现实，必须应用探讨现实之唯一科学的方法——辩证方法，唯物辩证方法。
    唯物辩证法是关于自然、社会、思惟底发展之普遍规律的科学。这样，唯物辩证法不仅研究自然与社会底发展规律，而且也研究思惟底发展规律。因此便发生形式逻辑与唯物辩证法之相互关系问题，因为思惟规律同是两者研究底对象，而对于形式逻辑这是全部对象，对于唯物辩证法则仅仅是一部分对象。形式逻辑与唯物辩证法底这一相互关系问题之发生，也是由于形式逻辑和唯物辩证法乃是认识现实的手段、“武器”，服务于认识现实的目的，应用认识现实的一定的方法。形式逻辑底方法与唯物辩证法底方法是不相同的，但是两者在认识、探讨现实现象的过程中都被应用着。
    这样，形式逻辑与唯物辩证法底相互关系问题是在于：规定在以唯物辩证法探讨和认识现实的过程中形式逻辑规律之应用范围。
    资产阶级学者，在研究自然、社会、思惟底规律时，通常是抹煞或直接否定唯物辩证方法，而应用形式逻辑底方法，仅仅利用形式逻辑底规律；在他们试图辩证地思考的场合下，他们也是唯心论地理解辩证法，而不是唯物论地理解辩证法。于是，在资产阶级学者底研究中，所提供的是现实底歪曲了的图画。在一些场合下，资产阶级学者也在科学中达到正确的结论，而这一情形之所以发生，是因为他们中间最有良心的人不由己地、无意识地、不自知地应用了辩证方法，在他们的研究中本能地达到了辩证法。
    马克思主义者是辩证地思惟的，对于他们，在其研究中起领导作用的是辩证法；因此，马克思主义的科学——而苏维埃的科学便是马克思主义的科学——乃是达到了空前繁荣、空前成果的先进的科学。但是科学、思惟、研究，在应用唯物辩证方法时，是不能忽视形式逻辑底规律的，因为忽视形式逻辑底规律就会在思惟中引起错误，会引起关于各种现实现象的不正确的结论。
    显然地，必须规定形式逻辑与唯物辩证法底相互关系，确定它们的差别及其联系。
    不正确地解决形式逻辑与唯物辩证法底相互关系问题，就能导引到最有害的、否定的结果，就能引起对现实的不正确的认识、对现实的歪曲的和曲解的说明，就是说，不是导引到真理，而是导引到错误的结论。相反地，如果正确地解决了这个问题，便可能利用形式逻辑底规律作为改善我们的思想工作、帮助我们认识现实的手段。
    辩证逻辑
    辩证的认识方法是把自然现象和社会现象看作互相联系的、永恒地运动着的和永恒地变化着的，而自然和社会底发展则是诸对立力量互相作用和斗争底结果。马克思和恩格斯所创造而为列宁和斯大林所发展、丰富的唯物辩证法，乃是关于自然、社会和思惟底发展之普遍规律的科学。恩格斯在其所著“自然辩证法”中把辩证法分为客观辩证法和主观辩证法。客观辩证法是在自然界中占统治地位的。客观辩证法是自然现象和社会现象底发展自身和运动自身，是由于矛盾、由于从逐渐的量变过渡到根本的质变所引起的发展，也就是客观现实、客观世界、自然和社会底发展自身之辩证法。主观辩证法是由于矛盾、由于诸对立力量底斗争而引起的在整个自然界占统治地位的发展之在人底思惟中的反映。恩格斯曾经写道：“所谓的客观辩证法是在整个自然界中占统治地位的，而所谓的主观辩证法、辩证思惟则仅仅是由于对立而引起的在整个自然界中占统治地位的运动之反应，而这些对立以其不断的斗争及其相互地进到更高形式的根本转变来制约着自然生活”（一）。
    而在另一个地方又写道：“……头脑底辩证法仅仅是作为自然界和历史的现实世界底运动形式之反映而已”（二）。
    于是，我们可以这样弄清楚客观辩证法和主观辩证法底相互关系。客观辩证法是客观世界——自然界和社会——底现象之发展自身。主观辩证法是这种发展在意识中、在人底思惟中、在我们的概念和判断中的反映。这种主观辩证法也就是所谓的辩证逻辑。因为是和实现一致的，所以它是认识现实的唯一科学的方法。
    马克思主义的辩证法在斯大林同志所著关于“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论”中得到了经典式的规定。斯大林同志在把唯物辩证法与形而上学对比时，描述了辩证法底下列四个特征：
    “（一）与形而上学相反，辩证法不是把自然界看作彼此隔离、彼此孤立、彼此不相依赖的各个对象或各个现象底偶然堆积，而是把它看作有内在联系的统一整体，其中各个对象或各个现象互相有机地联系着、互相依赖着、互相制约着……
    （二）与形而上学相反，辩证法不是把自然界看作静止不动的状态、停顿不变的状态，而是看作不断运动、不断变化的状态，不断革新、不断发展的状态，其中总有某种东西在产生着和发展着，总有某种东西在毁坏着和衰颓着……
    （三）与形而上学相反，辩证法不是把发展过程看作简单的增长过程，看作量变不会引起质变的过程，而是看作由细小的和不显露的量变过渡到显露的变、过渡到根本的变、过渡到质变的发展过程，在这个过程中质变不是逐渐地发生，而是迅速地和突然地发生，即表现于由一种状态飞跃式地转变为另一种状态；并不是偶然地发生，而是规律式地发生，即是由许多不明显的逐渐的量变积累而引起的结果……
    （四）与形而上学相反，辩证法底出发点是：自然界底对象或自然界底现象含有内在的矛盾，因为所有这些对象或现象都有其反面和正面，都有其过去和将来，都有其衰颓着的东西和发展着的东西，而这种对立底斗争、旧东西与新东西之间的斗争、衰亡着的东西和产生着的东西之间的斗争、衰颓着的东西和发展着的东西之间的斗争，便是发展过程底内容、由量变过渡到质变这一过程底内容”（三）。
    作为关于自然界、社会和思惟底发展之普遍规律的科学的唯物辩证法便是这样。应用唯物辩证方法，才有可能从现实现象底多样性中，从它们的相互联系中、从它们的变化和发展中来认识现实现象，认识现实所含有而又制约着现实底发展的一切矛盾。
    形式逻辑底规律和方法与唯物辩证法底规律和方法
    马克思——列宁主义底古典著作给形式逻辑和辩证逻辑划出了明确的界限。列宁曾经写道：“形式逻辑……是以最普通的或经常看到的东西为指南来研究形式的规定，而且只局限于这一点。……辩证逻辑则要求我们更往前进。要真正了解一个对象，必须考察、研究它的一切方面、一切联系和‘媒介化’……这是第一。第二，辩证逻辑要求从其发展、‘自己运动’（如黑格尔有时所说的）、变化中考察一个对象”（四）。
    这里清楚明白地表现了两个原理：（一）形式逻辑和辩证逻辑是不同的科学，（二）形式逻辑对于辩证逻辑乃是知识底低级阶段
    形式逻辑方法比起辩证方法具有另外不同的特征。立足于同一律、矛盾律、排中律和充足理由律的形式逻辑所具有的特征是：彼此孤立地考察现实底对象或现象，在静止不动的状态中考察现实底对象或现象，排除我们关于现实现象的判断和推理中可能发生的一切矛盾。可能产生这样的印象：形式逻辑是与唯物辩证法不相容的，是与之矛盾的，是被它摈斥的。有一个时期这种见解曾经在我国十分流行，因此便否定了形式逻辑底科学意义，否定了它之作为科学而存在的权利。这种见解是错误的。形式逻辑并不被辩证法所摈斥，它只是放置在其应有的位置而作为认识或思惟底必要条件，但不是把对现实的整个认识过程包括无遗的条件。资产阶级唯心论哲学经常利用形式逻辑作为形而上学的思惟底基础，而且依靠形式逻辑底规律，把发展、新的代替旧的、对立底斗争排斥于对现实的考察之外。这种对认识现实的形而上学态度是马克思——列宁主义所坚决驳斥的，而且斯大林同志曾经极其清晰和明确地把辩证法同形而上学加以对比。
    否定形而上学并不意味着否定形式逻辑；马克思——列宁主义古典著作并不是一般地驳斥形式逻辑，而是驳斥形式逻辑之形而上学的解释和利用。
    形式逻辑在一定的认识范围内可以毫无保留地应用，而且它的方法也足以达到正确的结论。形式逻辑规律在其中起作用的这一认识范围，恩格斯为了明白和通俗起见曾规定为“家事”范围。
    “家事”是一个比喻的、有条件的用语，它意味着人在其每日实践中不能不对付的诸事物底简单的、寻常的关系，那时候我们思想底对象是作为已经形成的、在一定时间内不变化的东西而出现的，因而对于每一对象可以说：它或者是，或者不是，它有某种属性，或者没有，等等。
    列宁关于逻辑底“格”（即关于推理底形式）曾经写道：它们表现着“事物底最寻常的关系”（五）；“人底实践，重复了不止亿万次，于是在人底意识中以逻辑底格固定下来”（六）。
    这样，辩证逻辑反映着现实底运动和发展、反映着现实中对立底斗争、反映着现实现象底相互联系和相互依存，而形式逻辑则反映着对象和现象底最简单的关系，即这样的一些关系——在这些关系中对象和现象是按其于某一时间已被形成、已被规定的样式来考察的。
    在一定的认识范围内、在某一认识阶段上，这样考察现实现象是完全合乎法则的，而且满足了认识现实现象之目的，但是在更广大的范围内、在更高的认识阶段上，这就不够了，仅仅遵循形式逻辑底规律是不可能认识真理的，在这里必须应用辩证法。
    恩格斯以初等算学和高等算学底相互关系为例，非常清楚地阐明了形式逻辑和辩证法底相互关系。恩格斯在“自然辩证法”中论及形式逻辑底“固定”范畴时写道：它们“好象是逻辑底初等算学”。（七）这意味着：形式逻辑对于辩证逻辑就好象初等算学对于高等算学一样。在“反杜林论”中，恩格斯底这个思想表现如下：
    “甚至形式逻辑首先也是探寻新结果、从已知过渡到未知的方法；辩证法也是一样的，只是在更高得多的意义下；此外，辩证法突破了形式逻辑底狭窄界限，自身包含着更广大的世界观底萌芽。这种相互关系也发生于算学中。初等算学，即常量底算学，至少就一般和整个讲来，是在形式逻辑底界限内运动着；变量底算学，其绝大部分是无穷小底计算，就其本质讲来是辩证法在算学方面的应用”（八）。
    正如以辩证法底应用为基础的高等算学不取消也不剥夺以形式逻辑底应用为基础的初等算学底意义一样，辩证法不取消也不剥夺形式逻辑底意义；形式逻辑底规律在“常量”底范围内，在简单的规定了的对象和现象底范围内，是充分地保有着自己的力量的。
    当我们必须计数某些东西或测量面积的时候，我们将按照初等算学底规则来作，否则便没法办到。只须想象一个会计师，他借助那把无穷大、无穷小、变量等等都计算在内的高等算学来作企业底财政计算，那么我们就会了解：以初等算学不包括一切数量关系和空间形式为理由而便否认之，这是多么荒谬。同样的情形也发生于形式逻辑和辩证法底关系中。辩证法从发展、运动、联系和相互作用来考察现实现象，这并不排除有考察现实现象底最简单关系之必要，并不排除有把它们看作在特定的一段时间内和特定的具体条件下是稳固的、确定的、分离的现象之必要。此外，任何发展着的现象，只有当我们预先分出和考察正在发展着的东西时，才能够加以研究。各个现象或对象间的联系，只有在我们个别地分出和考察其间有联系存在着的东西的条件下，才能够加以研究。现象或对象底各个矛盾方面，只有在预先分出和考察其间有矛盾存在着的东西的条件下，才能够加以研究。
    在整个现实中进行着的发展、变化、对立底斗争，并不排斥现象、对象或事物在特定的一段时间内的某种相对的稳定，任何事物都是变化着的，但是在某一段时间内这些变化是不大的、不显著的，并且对于实践的目的是无关紧要的。这些变化在达到某一限度以前是在不改变质的范围内进行的。试把一个玻璃杯拿在手中，它是在变化或是没有变化呢？这个玻璃杯一直在变化着：可能有一些指痕出现，玻璃底光泽暗淡了，玻璃杯底用途可能发生变化等等。但是暂时我们还没有把这个玻璃杯打碎，暂时我们为了一定的目的还可以利用它，这毕竟还是同一个玻璃杯，而它所发生的变化对于我们并没有任何实际的意义，这些变化是不显著的和无关紧要的。因此，关于这个玻璃杯，不能说它是玻璃的也不是玻璃的，是透明的也不是透明的，是大的也是小的，是完整的也是厂破碎的等等；关于它的任何属性，根据形式逻辑底规律，不能不说：它是或不是（按照公式：是——不是）。
    这就是说，只要在特定的一段时间内一个对象保持着相对的不变，那么在考察这个对象时可以充分地应用思惟底四个规律——同一律、矛盾律、排中律和充足理由律。关于一个人我们可以说：他或者是活着，或者是死了。这从以思惟底四个规律为基础的逻辑观点看来是正确的。但是我们知道：在生与死之间有着比初看起来更加复杂得多的关系。如果我们是科学地、辩证地研究生与死，那么我们将阐明：虽然一个人现在是活着的，但是在他的机体内却一直进行着死亡底过程；当一个人死去的时候，机体内的生命过程也不是一下子停止的。然而当我们考察我们所知道的一个人底生死问题时，对于我们重要的是十分明白地确定这个人是死了还是活着。对于这个人是活着还是死了的问题，只能回答或者活着、或者死了，即根据形式逻辑底规律而回答；但是不可说：这个人不是活着也不是死了，或者他是活着也是死了。如果一个医生对于这个人是活着或是死了的问题回答说是和不是，或者既非是也非不是，即他违反了形式逻辑底规律，那么这将是对常识的嘲弄，而且这好象是“既不是活着也不是死了”这句著名的话一样，这句话是对于一个惊愕到对自己也莫名其妙的人而使用的。
    我们再举另外一个例子。关于道德的概念不是始终不变的，它们是变化着的，是随着社会底发展而发展的。在人类发展各个不同的阶段上，关于道德的概念、关于好、坏、善、恶的概念都是各不相同的，正如这些概念在同一时代对于各个不同的阶级——对于剥削者和被剥削者——是各不相同的。社会主义的道德根本上是与资产阶级的道德不同的。只有用唯物辩证方法，从道德观与社会物质生活条件总和之联系去考察道德观，才能了解、研究和说明道德观底发展和变化。辩证方法不仅使人能够确定在某些社会条件下被认为道德的、值得赞许的东西，而在另一些条件下却被看作不道德的、应当受责难的东西，并且使人能够科学地阐明道德观中的这些差别。可是当我们考察一个人在特定的条件下所作的某一特定的行为，并且想辨别这个行为，予以道德的评价，即决定这个行为是否是不道德的、不合乎伦理的——我们对这个问题就应当给与一个完全直言式的答案——是或不是，即按照形式逻辑规则的答案，不能回避而不答复这个问题或给与一个模棱两可的、模糊不清的答案——这是坏的，也是好的。在这里答案应当是确定的——或者是，或者不是。
    这样，在事物和现象底最简单关系之范围内，形式逻辑底规律是完全有效的，它们对于认识有关的对象是足够的。
    但是在高级的认识阶段上，当人底思想之目的是从现实现象底一切多样性中、从其发展底一切复杂性和矛盾性中去认识现实，认识其规律性，揭示现象、对象或事变底联系和相互依存，——形式逻辑便不够了，在这里就要应用辩证逻辑、唯物辩证法。但是在这个范围内，在辩证法起着支配作用的这些认识阶段上，形式逻辑是否就失去其意义呢？形式逻辑底规律是否就丧失自己的力量呢？对于这个问题应当给以否定的回答。按照恩格斯底说法，辩证法突破了形式逻辑底狭窄界限，但是在依靠辩证方法底应用以认识现实的范围内并没有消灭或废除形式逻辑。形式逻辑底规律既是人的思想底必要条件，所以对于辩证思惟也保持着自己的力量，但只是作为辩证思惟底最简单的条件，因为辩证思惟服从自己的规律，这些规律是现实、自然界和社会底发展规律在人底意识中的反映。
    辩证思惟不是与形式逻辑底规律相矛盾的。说辩证思惟不合逻辑，说它似乎破坏形式逻辑底规律，这是完全的曲解。我们要向辩证思惟底最伟大的大师——马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林——不仅学习应用辩证方法，而且还学习判断和推理中的严格的逻辑。
    辩证思惟揭露客观现实中的矛盾，揭露对立力量底斗争，形式逻辑在正确了解之下也丝毫不摈斥这些矛盾，它只是不容许矛盾的思想，不容许相互矛盾的论断，不容许根据不充分的和首尾不一贯的推论和结论，而这样的思想、论断、推论和结论在辩证思惟底领域中更是不容许的。
    要了解形式逻辑和唯物辩证法底具体相互关系，可以在自然现象和社会现象中随便举一个辩证的矛盾底例子，而我们在每一个场合下都可以看出这种辩证的矛盾丝毫也不废弃形式逻辑底规律。下面的例子便可以表明这点。
    马克思——列宁主义学说教导道：在社会发展底一定阶段上，国家是要衰亡的，国家在完全的共产主义社会中是要消灭的，那时候社会将不会分为阶级了。斯大林同志在党底第十八次代表大会上的报告中发展了关于社会主义国家衰亡的这一学说，确定了在共产主义时期也只有在资本主义包围被消灭了的时候国家才会衰亡（九）。这就是说，当适当的条件到来的时候，社会主义的国家便会衰亡。同时共产党和苏维埃政权底整个政策又是以巩固和加强社会主义国家为目的。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上的报告中关于这一点讲了下面的一段话。（未完待续）
