Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 7th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions on November 29th and December 1st to discuss the Soviet proposal on condemning preparations for a new war, the five major powers concluding a peace-strengthening pact, and prohibiting atomic weapons with strict control of atomic energy, as well as the joint US-UK proposal on so-called "essentials of peace".

At the General Assembly, the Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky's solemn and powerful speech demonstrated that the United States and the United Kingdom are actively preparing for a new war, proving the necessity and timeliness of the Soviet proposal.

At the meeting on November 29, Vyshinsky spoke first. He pointed out that the most important suggestion put forward by the Soviet delegation represents the continuation and development of the peace proposals repeatedly put forward by the Soviet representatives at the United Nations. It reflects the general line of the Soviet foreign policy principles, reflecting the Soviet Union's consistent and unwavering struggle for peace, international security, and friendship.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the US-British bloc, which systematically undermines the UN Charter, has undermined and weakened the United Nations, thereby nullifying the importance of the United Nations in international affairs. The establishment of military aggression groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty or the Brussels Group is clear evidence. Vyshinsky said: We know their special division of labor in their positions, that is, the North Atlantic Alliance is preparing for a new war, and the United Nations—that is, its US-British majority—is covering up this ugly work with hypocritical declarations of so-called efforts for peace.

Vyshinsky sharply criticized the so-called joint US-British proposal, believing that the suggestions in it are declarative and ineffective, even though it is adorned with the high-sounding title of "essentials of peace."

Vyshinsky pointed out that these suggestions are a mixture of harmful provisions restricting the national sovereignty of various countries and general declarations, and such suggestions cannot become a serious obstacle to the US-British instigators of a new war. Currently, precisely when the General Assembly is discussing the Soviet proposal, the calls for a new war to destroy mankind continue to clamor in the United States, and those generals who openly and shamelessly calculate how to eliminate more peaceful residents in future wars continue to make speeches. The US authorities are expanding their network of bases in Western Europe, and at the same time, US generals are visiting Western European countries one after another, causing panic among the people of these countries.

Vyshinsky finally pointed out that all these facts, as well as the discussions in the Political Committee surrounding the Soviet proposal, confirm the timeliness and necessity of the Soviet proposal. All the objections made by the Political Committee to the Soviet proposal are completely excuses.

Vyshinsky's speech aroused applause from delegations of many countries, and was repeatedly interrupted by applause during the speech.

However, this calm and solemn speech by the head of the Soviet delegation, based on irrefutable facts, also aroused the irrepressible annoyance of the US-British representatives who opposed peace. US Representative Austin delivered an incoherent and contradictory speech. He said that Vyshinsky's speech has the purpose of dominating the minds of the people of all countries. Austin exhausted the clichés against the Soviet proposal and said that the United States cannot support these suggestions because these suggestions condemn the US-British engaging in preparations for a new war. Austin exclaimed: To condemn the United States and Britain and force them to sign a peace pact? ... No way.

### 联大讨论苏联和平提案　维辛斯基坚持原则立场  美英“多数”照例否决苏联建议

　　联大讨论苏联和平提案
  　维辛斯基坚持原则立场
    美英“多数”照例否决苏联建议
    【新华社北京七日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十一月二十九日与十二月一日举行全体会议，讨论了苏联所提关于谴责新战争准备、五强缔结加强和平公约与禁用原子武器并严格管制原子能的提案，并讨论了美英两国关于所谓“和平要义”的联合提案。
    在大会上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基所作的严正有力的发言，证明美国与英国正在进行着新战争的积极准备，证明苏联提案的需要与恰合时宜。
    在十一月二十九日的会议上，维辛斯基首先发言。他指出：苏联代表团所提出的最重要的建议，表现出苏联代表在联合国所一再提出的和平建议的继续和发展，它反映出苏联外交政策原则的总路线，反映出苏联所始终如一并坚守不渝地为和平、为国际安全与友好而奋斗的路线。
    维辛斯基指出，有系统地破坏联合国宪章的美英集团，已经破坏和削弱了联合国，从而使联合国在国际事务中的重要性化为乌有。北大西洋公约或布鲁塞尔集团等等军事侵略集团的成立，就是明证。维辛斯基说：我们知道它们在职务上的特别分工，即北大西洋联盟是在准备新战争，而联合国——即是它的美英多数，则在以所谓为和平而努力的虚伪声明来掩盖这个丑恶的工作。
    维辛斯基尖锐地抨击所谓美英的联合提案，他认为其中的建议都是宣言性的，毫无效力的，虽然它加上了“和平要义”这种高调式的题目。
    维辛斯基指明，这些建议乃是关于限制各国国家主权的有害规定与笼统的宣言的混合物，这种建议不能成为对于新战争的美英鼓动者的严重障碍。目前，恰恰当着联大讨论苏联建议的时候，毁灭人类的新战争叫嚣继续在美国喧嚷着，那些公开而无耻地盘算着如何能在未来的战争中消灭更多的和平居民的将军们，继续发表谈话。美国当局正在扩大它们在西欧的基地网，同时，美国将军们接二连三地巡游西欧各国，在这些国家的人民中引起惊恐。
    维辛斯基最后指出：所有这些事实以及政治委员会中围绕着苏联提案所进行的讨论，都证实了苏联提案的适时与必需。政治委员会对苏联建议所作的一切反对，完全是借口。
    维辛斯基的演说激起许多国家代表团的掌声，而且在演说中间也一再地为掌声所中断。
    但是，苏联代表团团长这一以无可反驳的事实为根据的沉着而庄严的演说，也引起反对和平的美英代表们不可抑止的恼怒。美国代表奥斯汀发表了前后错乱的自相矛盾的演说。他说，维辛斯基的演说具有支配各国人民头脑的目的。奥斯汀用尽了反对苏联提案的陈词滥调，并且说美国不能支持这些建议，因为这些建议谴责美英从事新战争准备。奥斯汀大叫：要谴责美国和英国又要迫使它们签订和平公约吗？……不行。
