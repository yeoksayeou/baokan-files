　　Shanghai Workers Sincerely Thank the Government, Willing to Compete to Purchase Victory Bonds with Year-End Bonuses
  　Private Enterprise Employees Reasonably Negotiate Year-End Bonus Methods with Factory Management
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee announced the "Measures for Handling Original Year-End Double Pay or Bonus Issues in Certain State-Owned Enterprises," the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee successively issued circulars on the 15th and 17th, calling on state-owned enterprise employees throughout the city to understand the nation's current difficulties and support and resolutely implement the Central Financial and Economic Committee's regulations. State-owned enterprise employees throughout the city then launched heated discussions. After days of discussion, the employees of the eleven factories under the China Textile Construction Company (referred to as China Textile) and the China Merchants Shipbuilding Repair Plant, the Shanghai Wheel Retreading Plant, the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, and the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory first unanimously expressed their support. All employees of China Textile Factory No. 9 said in a letter to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee: "We report to you with incomparable excitement that over four thousand employees of China Textile Factory No. 9 have unanimously expressed their firm support for the three measures of the Central Financial and Economic Committee regarding year-end bonuses; and we assure you that we can endure temporary difficulties, tighten our belts, actively produce, and strive for the rapid and complete liberation of the whole country." Over two thousand three hundred workers from China Textile Factory No. 10 also passed a resolution writing to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, expressing heartfelt thanks and support to the government for still taking care of the workers' interests and stipulating the three principles of year-end bonuses under the current financial difficulties, and are willing to support the government's decision with practical actions of increased production. Many employees in private enterprise factories have automatically put forward the slogan of learning from state-owned factories, such as the employees of Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 5, Yong'an Yarn Factory Nos. 3 and 5, Hengfeng Yarn Factory, Dafeng Yarn Factory, Anle Yarn Factory No. 3, and Lifeng, Dayuan, Hongxin and other dyeing and weaving factories, Fufeng Flour Factory, Guanghua Electric Wire Factory, etc., all taking into account the actual situation of the factory and reasonably negotiating to determine the methods for issuing year-end bonuses. Employees of various factories in Shanghai not only warmly support the year-end bonus measures stipulated by the government, but are also launching a surge of competing to subscribe to the People's Victory Real Unit Public Bonds with all or part of their year-end bonuses. They believe that this is a positive way to assist the People's Government in overcoming financial difficulties. Hu Zhen＠Tian, Tao Qiming and other fourteen young workers from the China Merchants Shipbuilding Repair Branch are willing to subscribe to public bonds with their entire year-end bonus. Other workers in the factory also paid a part of their year-end bonus to subscribe. The executive committee members of the Shanghai Electric Power Company branch of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have currently subscribed to over one thousand shares of real unit public bonds. Chen Zong＠Xian of the Telephone Company subscribed to public bonds with half of his year-end bonus, and encouraged by his wife, he also subscribed to real unit public bonds with the remaining half.
