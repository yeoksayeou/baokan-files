Because I had spent a long time in school stubbornly sticking to books, I became a person who always loved to wander in the circles of abstract theories, and always felt "incompatible" with practical work. When it came to study and discussion, I could still spout a few things in a scholastic manner, but when I encountered work problems, I would stare blankly. "No problem," "No opinion" was the only opinion I might have on the work. Gradually, I lost confidence in my work and felt that my ability was poor. I excused myself by saying: "I am only suitable for academic work, not for work."

Not long ago, the leadership transferred me to work. Every day I encountered work problems. I thought, if I continue to be unconfident in my work as before, the result will not only make me feel bad, but also greatly affect the progress of the work. When things came to the point where they had to be resolved, I began to consider whether the so-called lack of confidence and opinions on work was really due to the problem of lack of ability. From this, I thought of my previous attitude towards work:

When work didn't come looking for me, I rarely looked for work, let alone dig up problems, holding the idea that it wouldn't be too late to figure things out when work came; and when work really came, I just let it slide lightly in my mind, without even turning a corner, and let it pass. Because it was so "boring" and so "dry"! It would be better to use that time and energy to read some books, which would nourish the brain and be full of interest. And usually, I never paid attention to or studied everything that was happening and changing around me. I just turned a deaf ear and a blind eye, feeling that it had nothing to do with me and was not worth paying attention to, it was better to save effort. And what I really thought was worth paying attention to and worth spending time and energy on was only books, and only the kind of books that I was interested in. So, if anything hindered me from reading, I would be annoyed and dissatisfied. The principle for me in doing anything was not to hinder me from reading the books I was interested in. In this way, I gradually lost my sense of the things around me, could not find problems in my work, could not put forward opinions, and therefore lost confidence in my work, and the result was to blame myself for not being able to do it, and the way out I found for myself was "not suitable for work, only suitable for academic work." Little did I know that if a person doesn't give work a certain amount of consideration, then the problems in the work will never actively let you discover or feel them.

Obviously, this phenomenon of lack of confidence in work and inability to put forward opinions is not a question of ability or lack of ability, but a question of whether or not one is willing to put down the burden of individualism, whether or not one is willing to make personal interests subordinate to revolutionary interests, and ultimately, whether or not one is willing to serve the people wholeheartedly.

Books should be read, but what is the use of reading them if they are divorced from reality and only to satisfy personal interests?

### 工作怎样就有了信心？

　　工作怎样就有了信心？
    由于长期在学校里死扣书，我变成了一个老爱在抽象的理论圈子里打转，而对实际工作则总感到“格格不入”的人。逢到学习讨论时，我倒还能学究式地扯几句，但一碰到工作问题，就瞪眼了，“没问题”，“没意见”就是我可能有而且仅有的对工作的意见。这样慢慢地我就对工作失去了信心，觉得自己能力差。自己给自己解嘲曰：“我只适于搞学术，不适合搞工作。”
    不久以前上级调我出来工作了，整天碰到的尽是工作问题，我想，假如我再象以前那样对工作无信心地下去，其结果，不但弄得自己情绪不好，而且更会大大地影响了工作的开展。当事情到了非解决不可的关头，我就开始考虑，所谓对工作无信心，无意见，到底是不是由于能力差这个问题了。由此，我就想起了从前我对工作的那种态度来：
    当工作不找我的时候，我很少找工作，更少发掘问题，抱着工作啥时候来，啥时候再作道理不迟的想法；而当工作真的来了时，我却只让它轻轻地在脑子里一滑，连个湾都不转就叫它过去了。因为那是多么“没意思”，多么“干燥”呀！有那时间和那精力用来读点书该多好，既能滋养脑筋，又是兴味盎然。而平常，对自己周围所发生着变化着的一切，也从不注意，从不钻研。只是听而不闻，视而不见，觉得那与我无干，不值得注意，还是少费心力为妙。而真正被我认为值得注意，值得付出时间精力去搞的就只有书本，而且是只有自己感兴趣的那种书本。于是，任何事情要是妨碍了我读书，我就要懊恼，我就要不满意。我搞任何事情都要以不妨碍读我感兴趣的书为原则，就这样我就对周围的事物逐渐失去了感觉，在工作中发现不了问题，提不出意见，因而就失去了对工作的信心，结果就归咎于自己能力不行，自己给自己找的出路就是“不适于搞工作，只适于搞学术”。殊不知一个人要是对工作不给予一定的考虑，则工作中的问题决不会主动地让你发现或感觉出来。
    显然，这种对工作无信心，提不出意见的现象，决不是什么有没能力的问题，而是肯不肯丢下个人主义包袱的问题，肯不肯使个人利益服从革命利益的问题，归根结蒂一句话，肯不肯全必全意为人民服务的问题。
    书是应该读的，但，如其离开实际，只是为了满足个人的兴趣而读书，那有什么用处呢？
