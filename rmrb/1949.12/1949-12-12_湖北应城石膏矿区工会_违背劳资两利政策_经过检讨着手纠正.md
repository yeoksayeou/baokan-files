Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 10th: In the well-known Yingcheng County gypsum mining area of Hubei Province, production recovery has been severely hampered in the past six months due to the failure of government and trade union workers to correctly implement the policies of developing production and promoting mutual benefit for both labor and capital. When Yingcheng was liberated in April this year, most of the gypsum factory owners fled to Hankou, and all gypsum factories were shut down, resulting in the unemployment of more than 4,000 workers. In the half year since liberation, more than 1,000 workers have regained employment due to the resumption of production at five salt factories and two gypsum factories. Their production enthusiasm has also increased compared to the past. However, due to the erroneous handling of labor-capital relations by the district government and trade union leaders in the mining area, serious problems still exist in the mining area's production work.

In late April, after the establishment of the district government in the mining area, a trade union was formed within two days. As a result, the leadership of the trade union remained in the hands of the old foremen. Without consulting higher authorities or studying the actual situation of both labor and capital, the district government leaders arbitrarily organized workers from various factories to establish "Production Management Committees," which controlled financial and production powers. The living conditions of gypsum factory capitalists were subjected to a "rationing system," with daily allowances for rice, vegetable money, etc.; and staff members were regarded as capitalists, with all work decided by the "Production Management Committee" and then ordered to be carried out by the staff.

These erroneous measures have had the following negative consequences: (1) Gypsum factory capitalists either fled to Wuhan or moved all their relatives, near and far, into the factory to demand "rations." For example, at the Kai Jiyuan Gypsum Factory, there were only eighteen workers in the entire factory, but the capitalists' family members numbered thirty-three. They had the idea of consuming everything until it was gone and had no intention of continuing to operate the factory. (2) Gypsum factory owners shirked their debts onto the workers, saying, "Since you are managing the factory, you should repay my debts." This pitted creditors against workers, leading to constant disputes. (3) Unemployed workers were pitted against employed workers and the government. Unemployed workers flocked to the "Production Management Committee" and the district government to demand repayment of past wages owed by the capitalists, which affected the unity within the workers. (4) The "Production Management Committee" was controlled by a few foremen and ruffians. Economic matters were not transparent, and some "committee members" even received subsidies from the capitalists. These feudal foremen continued to commit crimes and oppress workers in the mining area. In August, a foreman beat a child laborer to death, but the district government and the trade union have yet to investigate and deal with the matter.

These serious negative consequences did not arouse the vigilance of the district government and trade union leaders at the time, nor did they think of ways to remedy them. In August, the "Production Management Committee" was changed to the "Factory Affairs Management Committee," with labor and capital participating in management together. However, in adjusting wage issues, some "committee members" arbitrarily raised wages without the agreement of both labor and capital. The district government also took a rash attitude in handling labor disputes, even arbitrarily arresting and detaining people. It was not until the first Hubei Provincial Trade Union Congress formally raised the labor-capital issues in the Yingcheng Gypsum Mining Area in early November that it aroused the deep attention of the leading organs and relevant parties. The trade union workers in the mining area also deeply criticized at the meeting that the aforementioned measures that disregarded the long-term interests of the working class were completely wrong.

Currently, the leading organ of trade union work in Hubei Province has decided to start by strengthening leadership over the work in the mining area, reorganizing the trade union, and formulating collective labor-capital contracts, in order to correct the above deviations and quickly restore production in the mining area.

The Yingcheng Gypsum Mining Area is located in the northwest of Yingcheng County, spanning ten square kilometers, with gypsum reserves of over 540 million tons. It is an important raw material for the manufacture of cement, agricultural fertilizers, art, education, and medical supplies. Some minerals in the mine can be made into edible salt for consumption by over one million people nearby.

### 湖北应城石膏矿区工会　违背劳资两利政策　经过检讨着手纠正

　　湖北应城石膏矿区工会
  　违背劳资两利政策　经过检讨着手纠正
    【新华社汉口十日电】著名的湖北省应城县石膏矿区，半年来由于政府工作人员和工会工作人员没有正确执行发展生产、劳资两利的政策，使生产的恢复受到极大的损害。今年四月应城解放时，绝大部分的膏厂主人逃往汉口，膏厂全部停工，四千多工人因此失业。解放以后半年来，由于五个盐厂和二个膏厂恢复生产，一千多个工人已经重新得到工作。他们的生产情绪，也较过去提高。但是，由于矿区的区政府和工会领导人员错误地处理劳资关系，矿区的生产工作至今尚存在着严重的问题。
    四月下旬，矿区所在地的区政府成立以后，两天之内就成立了工会。结果，工会的领导权，仍为旧工头所操纵。区政府的领导人员既不请示上级，也不研究劳资双方的实际情况，就擅自组织各厂工人成立“生产管理委员会”，掌握财政和生产的实权。对于膏厂资方的生活，则实行“配给制”，每日发给食米、菜金等；并把职员看成资方，一切工作由“生产管理委员会”决定后，便命令职员去办。
    这些错误的措施，造成了如下的恶果：（一）膏厂资方或者逃到武汉，或者把所有远近亲戚统统搬到厂内，要求“配给”。其中如开纪元膏厂，全厂只有十八个工人，而资方眷属却达三十三人，他们存着吃光算数的想法，再也无心经营下去。（二）膏厂厂方把债务推卸给工人，并说：“你们管了厂，应该给我还债”。从而使债主和工人对立，争吵不休。（三）失业工人和在业工人及政府对立。失业工人纷纷向“生产管理委员会”和区政府要求索还过去资方所欠的工资，小帐，影响了工人内部的团结。（四）“生产管理委员会”为少数工头、流氓所把持，经济不公开，甚至有些“委员”还受资方津贴。这些封建性的工头，在矿区继续为非作歹，压迫工人。八月份内工头打死童工一名，区政府和工会至今没有调查处理。
    这些严重的恶果，当时并未引起区政府和工会领导人员的警惕，也未想办法来补救。到八月间，“生产管理委员会”改为“厂务管理委员会”，由劳资双方共同参加管理。但是，在调整工资问题上，不经劳资双方协议，有些“委员”就随便提高工资。区政府在处理劳资争议时，也采取轻率的态度，甚至随便捕押人。直到十一月上旬，湖北省首届工会代表会议正式提出应城石膏矿区的劳资问题后，才引起领导机关和有关方面的深切注意。矿区的工会工作人员也在会上深刻检讨前述种种漠视工人阶级长远利益的措施是完全错误的。
    现在，湖北省工会工作的领导机关，已经决定从加强对于矿区工作的领导和改组工会，订立劳资集体合同等办法着手，努力纠正上述偏向，以便迅速恢复矿区的生产。
    应城石膏矿区位于应城县西北境内，纵横十方公里，石膏储藏量达五亿四千多万吨，为制造水泥、农田肥料、美术、教育和医疗用品的重要原料。矿内部分矿物可制成食盐，供附近一百多万人的食用。
