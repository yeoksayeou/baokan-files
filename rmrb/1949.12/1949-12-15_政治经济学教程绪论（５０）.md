    Section 3 Class Nature, Party Affiliation and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Specific Manifestations of the Class Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Marxist-Leninist political economy is a science of class nature, and it has never concealed its class nature. The class nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy is mainly manifested in its standpoint, which is that of the proletariat and the working class, and for the interests of the proletariat and the working class. Its viewpoint is that of the proletariat and the working class, and for the interests of the proletariat and the working class. This kind of standpoint and viewpoint are the most direct and basic reflections of the class interests of the proletariat and the working class. Therefore, Marxist-Leninist political economy is political economy that stands on the standpoint and viewpoint of the proletariat and the working class, representing and reflecting the interests of the proletariat and the working class. It is a science that firmly stands on the standpoint of the proletariat and the working class and struggles for the interests of the proletariat and the working class. It is completely and closely linked and combined with the strength of the proletariat and the working class, with the entire doctrine of the proletariat and the working class, that is, with the entire doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and with the struggle actions of the proletariat and the working class. It is a science that is completely opposed to bourgeois political economy. It opposes all bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, and conciliatory theories and actions that oppose the class interests of the proletariat and the working class. It criticizes the socio-economic structure of capitalism and other various exploitation systems. It analyzes and exposes the class nature, class stand, and class interests of bourgeois political economy. It points out the essential content of bourgeois political economy theories and doctrines, revealing their distortion of the truth and attempts to conceal the facts of bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat, and points out a clear path for the liberation of the proletariat and the exploited people of the world, and resolutely and heroically fights to the end to achieve the liberation of the proletariat and the exploited and oppressed people of the world and the advent of a worldwide socialist society.
    Because the interests of the modern proletariat and the working class embody the interests of all exploited and oppressed people in the world, Marxist-Leninist political economy, standing on this standpoint and viewpoint, is, in a broad sense, a science that analyzes the socio-economic structures of capitalism and various socio-economic structures before and after capitalism, elaborates the laws of various socio-economic developments, and indicates the path of liberation for various exploited and oppressed people and the path of common liberation for mankind. In a narrow sense, it uses this standpoint and viewpoint to indicate what ways, methods, and steps the proletariat should take in capitalist society to get rid of their inhuman life of wage slavery and liberate their own class and other exploited and oppressed working people. Therefore, political economy in the narrow sense is, on the one hand, a weapon of understanding, and on the other hand, a revolutionary and critical weapon.
    Party Affiliation
    Since Marxist-Leninist political economy is a science of class nature, it is also a science with party affiliation or party nature.
    The party nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy is the highest and most concentrated expression of the class nature of the proletariat and the working class in political economy, and the highest and most concentrated expression of the interests of the proletariat and the working class. Because the class nature of the proletariat and the working class is the most revolutionary and progressive class nature, its party nature is also the most revolutionary, progressive, and lofty party nature. Marxist-Leninists have never concealed this scientific party affiliation or party nature. They openly recognize and publicize the scientific party affiliation or party nature. They demand that their scientific theories have strict and high party affiliation or party nature. Unlike bourgeois political economy and political economists, who clearly see that their political economy is a high and concentrated expression of bourgeois interests, a high and concentrated expression of bourgeois class nature, and a science of bourgeois nature and party affiliation or party nature, they try to hide and conceal it in every possible way, and are unwilling and dare not admit the class nature and party affiliation of their science. In essence, as Lenin said, bourgeois political economists "are, generally speaking, nothing more than learned stewards of the bourgeoisie," and bourgeois political economy is also "like epistemology, a partisan science in modern society" (Lenin: "Materialism and Empirio-criticism"), but the party affiliation or party nature of bourgeois political economy, apart from having some progressive significance in the early stage of capitalist development, is fully manifested in the characteristics of parasitism, decay, decline, and reaction due to the growth of the parasitic, corrupt, declining, and reactionary class nature of the bourgeoisie.
    Marxist-Leninists and Marxist-Leninist political economists, because the class interests they represent and reflect are the interests of the most advanced, most revolutionary, most selfless, most great, and most extensive proletariat and working class in modern times, and because they represent and reflect the interests and demands of the advanced mankind in the world, they never conceal their scientific class nature, and therefore never conceal the party affiliation or party nature that is the highest and most concentrated expression of this class.
    The party affiliation or party nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy means that this theoretical doctrine, which represents the most advanced mankind in the modern world—the modern proletariat and the working class—is closely and inseparably linked with the propositions and tactical lines of the Communist Party, which is the vanguard of the proletariat and the highest and most concentrated representative of the interests of the proletariat. It is closely and inseparably linked with the Communist Party's analysis of society and socio-economy, and its attitude towards social and socio-economic development. It requires us to stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary and progressive proletariat and the working class when examining and analyzing social phenomena and socio-economic phenomena, and to embody the class status and class interests of the revolutionary and progressive proletariat and the working class. Because only this class status can enable us to gain a profound, essential, comprehensive, thorough, and correct understanding of society and socio-economic phenomena, can guarantee our correct understanding and grasp of objective truth, and can embody our broad interests in the proletariat, the working class, and other exploited and oppressed working people and other people. It requires us to observe, evaluate, and criticize every socio-economic phenomenon, every economic event, and economic behavior from the standpoint of the proletariat and the viewpoint of the Communist Party representing the interests of this class and the tactical line embodying this standpoint, and to obey and serve the current, eternal, lowest, and highest interests of the proletariat and the working class and their political party, that is, the Communist Party.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（５０）
    王学文
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    马列主义政治经济学阶级性的具体表现
    马列主义政治经济学是阶级性的科学，并且它从来也不隐讳它的阶级性。马列主义政治经济学的阶级性，主要表现在它的立场，是无产阶级，和工人阶级的，并为了无产阶级和工人阶级利益，它的观点是无产阶级和工人阶级的并为了无产阶级和工人阶级利益的观点，这种立场、观点，都是无产阶级和工人阶级的阶级利害的最直接最基本的反映。所以，马列主义政治经济学就是这样站在无产阶级和工人阶级的立场观点上代表和反映无产阶级和工人阶级利益的政治经济学。它是坚强地站在无产阶级和工人阶级立场上为无产阶级和工人阶级利益而奋斗的科学。它是与无产阶级和工人阶级的力量，与无产阶级和工人阶级的整个学说，也就是与马列主义的整个学说，与无产阶级和工人阶级的斗争行动完全是密切不可分离地联结着、结合着的。它是与资产阶级政治经济学完全是相对立的科学。它反对一切反对无产阶级和工人阶级阶级利益的资产阶级的、小资产阶级的与调和主义者的理论主张和行动，它批判资本主义与其他各种剥削制度的社会经济结构，它分析暴露资产阶级政治经济学的阶级性，阶级立场与阶级利益，它指出资产阶级政治经济学理论学说的实质内容，揭发它们歪曲真理、掩盖资产阶级对无产阶级剥削的事实与企图，为无产阶级与全世界被剥削人类的解放指出明确的道路，并为达到全世界无产阶级的解放与被剥削被压迫人类的解放实现全世界社会主义社会的到来而坚决英勇地奋斗到底。
    因为近代无产阶级和工人阶级的利益，它是体现着世界上一切被剥削被压迫人类的利益，所以站在这一立场观点上的马列主义政治经济学，就其广义的说来，它是解剖分析资本主义与资本主义以前和它以后各种社会经济结构，阐发各种社会经济发展规律，指示各种被剥削被压迫人类解放的道路与人类共同解放道路的科学。而就其狭义的说来，它运用这种立场观点，在资本主义社会里，指示无产阶级要摆脱他们非人的雇佣奴隶的生活，解放自己的阶级和其他被剥削被压迫的劳动人民应当采取一些什么方式、什么方法与什么步骤？因此狭义的政治经济学，一方面是认识的武器，另一方面是革命的批判的武器。
    党派性
    马列主义政治经济学由于它是阶级性的科学，因此它又是具有党派性或党性的科学。
    马列主义政治经济学的党性，就是政治经济学上无产阶级和工人阶级阶级性的最高也是集中的表现，就是无产阶级和工人阶级利益最高而最集中的表现。由于无产阶级和工人阶级的阶级性是最革命最进步的阶级性，因此它的党性也是最革命最进步和最崇高的党性。马列主义者也从来不隐瞒这种科学上的党派性或党性，他公开承认并宣传科学的党派性或党性，他要求他们的科学理论具有严密而高度的党派性或党性。他不象资产阶级的政治经济学与政治经济学者，明明他们的政治经济学是资产阶级利益高度而集中的表现，是资产阶级阶级性的高度而集中的表现，是资产阶级性和党派性或党性的科学，但却要百般隐藏掩饰，不肯承认也不敢承认它们的科学的阶级性和党派性。但实质上，照列宁的说法，资产阶级政治经济学者“大体说来无非是资产阶级有学问的管事”，资产阶级政治经济学也“正象认识论一样，在现代社会中是一种党派性的科学”（列宁：“唯物论与经验批判论”），只是资产阶级政治经济学的党派性或党性，除资本主义发展初期还带有若干进步意义以外，嗣后由于资产阶级寄生腐烂没落反动的阶级性的滋长，而充分表现在寄生、腐烂、没落与反动的特性。
    马列主义者和马列主义政治经济学者，由于它代表反映的阶级利益，是近代最先进最革命最大公无私最伟大最广泛的无产阶级和工人阶级的利益，由于它代表与反映着全世界先进人类的利益与要求，所以它从不隐讳它科学的阶级性，所以也从不隐讳作为这种阶级的最高也是最集中表现的党派性或党性。
    马列主义政治经济学的党派性或党性，就是说这种代表现代世界最先进人类——现代无产阶级和工人阶级的理论学说，是和作为无产阶级先锋队，无产阶级利益最高最集中的代表之共产党底主张和策略路线，是紧密不可分离地结合在一起的。是和共产党对于社会和社会经济的分析、对于社会和社会经济发展的态度是密切不可分开的。它要求我们在考察分析社会现象与社会经济现象时，必须紧紧地站在革命的进步的无产阶级和工人阶级一方面，体现着革命的进步的无产阶级和工人阶级的阶级地位和阶级利益。因为只有这一阶级地位，才能使我们对社会对社会经济现象获致深刻的、本质的、全面的、彻底的、正确的了解，才能保证我们对客观真理的正确认识和把握，才能体现我们对无产阶级、工人阶级以及对其他被剥削被压迫的劳动人民与其他人民的广大利益。它要我们对于每一社会经济现象，每一经济事件和经济行为进行批判评价时，必须公开地站在无产阶级的立场观点上和代表这一阶级利益的共产党的观点与体现这种立场观点的策略路线上来观察评价和批判，并服从与服务于无产阶级和工人阶级及他们的政党的、即共产党的目前的永远的、最低的和最高的利益。
