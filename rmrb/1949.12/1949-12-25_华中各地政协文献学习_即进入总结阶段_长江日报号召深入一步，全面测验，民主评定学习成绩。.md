　　Political Consultative Conference Documents Study in Central China
  　To Enter Summary Stage
    Yangtze Daily Calls for Further Depth, Comprehensive Testing, and Democratic Assessment of Learning Results.
    [Report from this newspaper] The political consultative conference document study movement in various parts of the Central China region is, to date, mostly scheduled to conclude before the end of the year. To this end, the Yangtze Daily, the organ of the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial on the 10th, calling for the continuation of the political consultative conference document study and further deepening it. At the end of the study period, a comprehensive test should be held, and learning achievements, learning attitudes, and learning effectiveness should be assessed through democratic means, and a comprehensive summary should be made to prepare a foundation for carrying out policy study and studying the twelve theoretical books designated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1950.
    The People's Political Consultative Conference document study in the Central China region began in October. The Propaganda Department of the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party first issued instructions, and party and government organs at all levels made specific arrangements. Workers, students, teachers, and staff in various places organized themselves to study. The directly affiliated organs of the Central China Bureau stipulated that cadres above the prefectural committee level should focus on self-study, while cadres below the county level should enter organ schools for study. The school is headed by Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central China Bureau, who also serves as the principal. In the past two months, the focus has been on studying the political consultative conference documents. Deng Zihui, Zhao Yimin, Zhang Zhiyi, and others have successively given reports on the main points of the Common Program, the General Program, the united front, economic policies, and urban policies, and answered difficult questions twice. Provinces and cities such as Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Wuhan, Party and government organs at all levels have successively carried out study mobilization, strengthened or established study leading bodies, and formulated or improved study systems and methods. Some places have also held tests and summarized preliminary results. Through this study, everyone has further understood the arduousness of the revolutionary tasks and improved their understanding of state power. Policy concepts have been strengthened, and the phenomenon of uneasiness at work has been greatly reduced. Generally speaking, everyone has made progress in their thinking and politics. However, the progress of the study still has an unbalanced phenomenon: wherever the principal leader is responsible, personally leads, has a plan, has arrangements, earnestly establishes various study systems (including self-study, note-taking, discussion, testing, criticism, and mutual assistance, etc.), promptly supervises and inspects, regularly studies the ideological trends in the study, and can actively and promptly solve the difficult problems in the study, and closely combines ideological leadership with organizational leadership, the study movement can persist, thereby improving the ideological level and work efficiency of the cadres; on the contrary, some leading organs and leading cadres do not pay enough attention to the study, only make arrangements, relax organizational leadership and ideological leadership, and the study has not been carried out.
    For this reason, the Yangtze Daily editorial pointed out that two links should be grasped during this period of study in the future: First, the study of the political consultative conference documents must be persisted. Leaders at all levels must personally take responsibility and lead this study in a planned and step-by-step manner, and regard it as a serious political task and work task. Oppose being hot and cold, working hard for a short period and then becoming lazy, starting strong and finishing weak, and letting things drift. Recognize that cadre study is a regular task, not a shock task, especially in the south-central region, where the newly liberated areas account for the vast majority, cadre study is one of the indispensable and important conditions for carrying out work. Second, the study of the political consultative conference documents must be deepened one step further, not only to deeply study the issues of state system and political system as well as the domestic and international united front, and strive to have a clear understanding and profound understanding, but also to deeply study the various policies listed in the Common Program, and check their overall work and thinking and style. Study a question thoroughly, and combine policy study with work study.

　　华中各地政协文献学习
  　即进入总结阶段
    长江日报号召深入一步，全面测验，民主评定学习成绩。
    【本报讯】华中全区各地的政协文件学习运动，到目前为止，大部地区将在年底以前结束。中共中央华中局机关报长江日报为此于十日发表社论，号召把政协文件的学习坚持下去，深入一步；学习告一段落时，应举行全面的测验，经过民主方式，评定学习成绩、学习态度和学习效果，并作出全面的总结，为一九五○年开展政策学习和学习中共中央指定的十二本理论书准备好基础。
    华中区的人民政协文件学习开始于十月间，中共中央华中局宣传部首先发布指示，各级党政机关都作了具体布置，各地工人、学生、教职员等纷纷组织起来进行学习。华中局直属各机关规定地委以上干部以自学为主，县级以下干部均入机关学校学习。该校由华中局宣传部赵毅敏部长兼任校长，最近两个月以学习政协文件为中心，先后由邓子恢、赵毅敏、张执一等作了共同纲领要点、总纲，统一战线，经济政策，城市政策等报告，并解答疑难问题两次。江西、河南、湖北、湖南、武汉等省市，各级党政机关均先后进行了学习动员，加强或建立了学习领导机构，制定或改进了学习制度和学习方法。有的地方并已举行测验，总结了初步成绩。通过这次学习，大家进一步理解了革命任务的艰巨，提高了对于国家政权的认识；政策观念加强了，不安心工作的现象大大减少，一般说来，都在思想上政治上提高了一步。但学习的进展仍存在着不平衡的现象：凡是首长负责、亲自领导、有计划、有布置、认真建立各种学习制度（包括自修、笔记、讨论、测验、批评互助等）、及时督促检查、经常研究学习中的思想动态，并能主动地及时地解决学习中的疑难问题，把思想领导与组织领导密切结合起来的单位，学习运动就能坚持，从而提高了干部的思想水平与工作效率；相反的，有某些领导机关与领导干部对学习还不够重视，只作布置，放松组织领导与思想领导，学习也就没搞起来。
    为此，长江日报社论指出今后这段学习期间应抓紧两个环节：第一、必须把政协文件学习坚持下去，各级首长必须亲自负责，有计划有步骤地领导这一学习，把它看成一个严重的政治任务与工作任务。反对忽冷忽热、一曝十寒、虎头蛇尾、放任自流。认清干部学习是一件经常工作，不是什么突击工作，特别是在新解放区占绝大比重的中南地区，干部学习是开展工作不可缺少的重要条件之一。第二、必须把政协文件的学习深入一步，不仅要深入研究国体政体以及国内国际统一战线问题，求得有一明确的认识与深刻的理解，而且还要深入研究共同纲领中所列举的各项政策，联系检查自己全盘的工作和思想、作风。学习一个问题钻通一个问题，把政策学习与工作学习结合起来。
