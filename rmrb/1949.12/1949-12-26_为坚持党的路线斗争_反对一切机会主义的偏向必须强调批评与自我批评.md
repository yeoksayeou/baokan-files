To uphold the Party's line struggle, opposing all opportunistic deviations requires emphasizing criticism and self-criticism.

We must unhesitatingly fight to uphold the Party's line and oppose all opportunistic deviations. We have only one line—the proletarian revolutionary line—the Communist Leninism-Stalinism line. The plenary session of this Central Committee provides new proof that this general line has not been changed in any of the Party's organizations. Not a single Party group or branch does not recognize this line.

Finally, the necessity of criticism and self-criticism should be emphasized, and should always be emphasized. Without criticism and self-criticism, the Party's progress will be hindered. The Central Committee has now provided an example of self-criticism.

Thorez continued: A few days ago, I received a journalist who tried to convince me that our enemies believed that within our Party, including the Party's leading organs, there were factional tendencies, even supporters of Tito. I told him: I am well aware that our enemies are always willing to take their wishes as facts, but I want to tell them that their fantasies are absolutely unfounded.

First of all, for us, the Party members, after thirty-two years of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and thirty years of active work within our Party, there can no longer be the slightest doubt that the path we have chosen is the only correct path. It is absurd for some to try to equate the socialist Soviet Union with Yugoslavia, which has once again fallen into the fascist shackles. Can we believe that any Communist Party member would follow Tito down the path of betrayal? For thirty years, we have been walking the path of Lenin and Stalin, and we are determined to continue on this path.

Secondly, whether it is to the Bolshevik Communist Party or to Stalin, we trust, absolutely trust, without any reservations. This is completely natural. This is based on practical experience, based on trust in scientific beliefs, this is political trust, which does not exclude our love for Stalin, but on the contrary, cultivates this love. Why shouldn't we declare: We love Stalin—our friend and leader—with all our hearts?

Thirdly, our enemies are willing to discover opposition within the leadership organs of our Party. They are unwilling to consider the background of our Party leaders, unwilling to consider that they are shaped in the spirit of Lenin and Stalin, that they practice collective leadership, work together like brothers, help each other, criticize each other, and have gone through many tests together. The situation within our Party is not bad. The warmongers and their agents believe that they can "spread chaos" within our Party. But if they try to do so, they will break their teeth.

In the current period where quality is the decisive factor, we must simultaneously pay strict attention to the quality and quantity of our Party's composition. We must ensure that we have good, active organizations in factories, Party leadership with strong cadres in all its key areas, organize and guide the entire mass movement, and realize our tasks with greater determination. As long as we trust the working class, trust the entire people, and trust our Party, we are able and bound to do this.

Regarding the question of the general election, Thorez stated: We do not demand to shorten the term of the current National Assembly. We have never opposed, and will never oppose, holding parliamentary elections. But we will oppose all attempts to establish a reactionary, arbitrary electoral system aimed purely at reducing the representation of the working class and the laboring people.

We must begin preparing for the Party's Twelfth National Congress, realize our tasks in all fields, correct our shortcomings, and improve our work. In this way, we can make an effective contribution to the struggle for peace by the working class and the French people. We will work for a democratic united government that can satisfy the demands of the workers, restore and expand the people's freedoms, and return France to the democratic peace camp. In this way, we will lead the country forward along the path of socialism.

    为坚持党的路线斗争
    反对一切机会主义的偏向必须强调批评与自我批评
    我们必须毫不犹豫地为坚持党的路线进行斗争，反对一切机会主义的偏向。我们只有一条路线——无产阶级革命的路线——共产党的列宁主义——斯大林主义的路线。本届中央委员会全会提供了新的证明，证明这个总的路线在任何党的组织里都没有被改变。没有一个党的小组或分支不承认这条路线。
    最后，批评和自我批评的必要应该强调，而且应该永远强调。不进行批评和自我批评，就会妨碍党的前进。中央委员会现在已提供了一个自我批评的范例。
    多列士继称：几天以前，我曾接见一个记者，他试图使我相信，我们的敌人认为我们党里，包括党的领导机构在内，有派别倾向，甚至还有铁托的支持者。我告诉他说：我很知道我们的敌人老是愿意把他们的愿望当成事实，但是，我愿告诉他们说，他们的空想是绝对没有根据的。
    首先，对于我们，党员们，在苏联进行社会主义建设已经三十二年和我们党内积极工作已经三十年以后，对于我们所选择的道路之为唯一正确的道路，已经不能再有丝毫的怀疑了。有些人试图反对我们，把社会主义国家的苏联和再度陷到法西斯铐镣下的南斯拉夫等量齐观，这是荒谬的。我们能够相信，会有任何一个共产党的党员跟着铁托走叛卖的道路吗？三十年来我们都是走着列宁和斯大林的道路，我们决心继续走这条道路。
    其次，不管是对布尔什维克共产党还是对斯大林，我们都信任，绝对信任，没有任何保留。这是完全自然的。这是基于实际的经验，基于对科学的信念的信任，这是政治的信任，它并不排除我们对斯大林的爱，而是相反地培育这种爱。为什么我们不应该宣布：我们以全部心灵热爱斯大林——我们的朋友和领袖呢？
    第三，我们的敌人愿意在我党的领导机构中发现反对派。他们不愿考虑到我党领袖的背景，不愿考虑到他们是按到列宁和斯大林的精神塑成的，他们是实行集体的领导，兄弟般地一同工作，互相帮助，互相批评，并曾一同经过了许多考验。我们党内的情形是不坏的。战争制造者和他们的代理人认为，他们能够在我们党内“散布混乱”。但是，他们如果尝试这样作，那就会碰断他们的牙齿。
    在目前质量是决定性因素的时期中，我们必须同时严格地注意我党成份的质和量。我们必须使得我们在工厂里有着好的、积极的组织，在其一切关键地方有着坚强干部的党的领导，组织和指导整个的群众运动，并以更大的决心实现自己的任务。只要我们信任工人阶级，信任整个人民，信任我们的党，我们是能够而且必然作到这一点的。
    关于大选的问题，多列士声称：我们不要求削短本届国民会议的任期。我们从未，也将决不反对举行国会选举。但是，我们将反对一切建立反动专横的、目的纯在削减工人阶级和劳动人民的代表权的选举制度的企图。
    我们必须着手准备党的第十二届全国代表大会，在一切领域里实现我们的任务，纠正我们的缺点，改进我们的工作。这样，我们就能使工人阶级和法国人民对和平斗争作有效的贡献。我们将为能满足工人要求的民主统一政府而工作，恢复和扩大人民的自由权，使法国再度进入民主和平的阵营。这样，我们就将领导国家沿着社会主义的道路前进。
