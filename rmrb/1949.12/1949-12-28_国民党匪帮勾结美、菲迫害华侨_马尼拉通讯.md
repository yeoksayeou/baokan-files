Manila Correspondence

　　Under the anti-Chinese policy of the Philippine reactionary government, a tool of US imperialism, the 180,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines have long lived in humiliation and hardship. Especially after bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek met with Quirino in Baguio in July this year, and the Kuomintang bandit gang's ambassador to the Philippines, special agent head Chen Chih-ping, cooperated with the Quirino government to intensify the persecution of overseas Chinese, the situation of overseas Chinese in the Philippines has become increasingly precarious.

　　Philippine government military police and special agent organs (including the Philippine Army Intelligence Department, Security Investigation Department, Capital Police Station Detective Department, National Bureau of Investigation Secret Service Department, Immigration Bureau Special Task Force, and Presidential Office Special Task Force) frequently use various pretexts to search, interrogate, and arrest overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines. In Manila alone, in the first half of October, more than 50 overseas Chinese businesses were searched, framed, and threatened with deportation by the Philippine police and special agents, who then extorted money from them. Persecution of overseas Chinese in other Philippine provinces and cities is also heard of daily. The Kuomintang bandits in the Philippines shamelessly assist in these atrocities, persecuting their own compatriots. They provide "intelligence" to the Philippine government's special agent organs, act as informants or eyes for the Philippine special agent organs, fabricate evidence, forge witnesses, and even directly lead Philippine government special agents to conduct searches and arrests at addresses. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three years, the Kuomintang bandit gang's embassies and consulates in the Philippines have provided the Philippine government with blacklists of more than 2,000 overseas Chinese, along with their photographs. Today, in the Philippine Islands, as long as an overseas Chinese person does not agree with the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous acts, as long as he does not participate in anti-communist organizations, he will be regarded as a "Chinese communist" and is in constant danger of being arrested. Recently, the Philippine government decisively deported five people, including Lu Junqing, the principal of the Dongyashi Timely Elementary School in Mindoro, Chen Yongtian, the chairman of the board, and directors Huang Zhupan, Wang Zhiming, and Huang Shibian, who had been arrested, abused, and detained for two or three years since the autumn of 1946 on charges of being "Chinese communists" and "providing assistance to the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army." They were illegally sentenced by the Director of the Immigration Bureau and sent to Xiamen, which was not yet liberated, to be executed by the bandit gang. Fortunately, the Xiamen bandit gang was internally shaken, and elements who wanted to correct their mistakes released them, allowing them to safely reach the liberated area.

　　In the past year, the Philippine reactionary government has colluded with Kuomintang special agent bandits to send people to inspect overseas Chinese letters and telegrams, widely recruiting Kuomintang special agents and ruffians/thugs to act as informants and eyes in various non-military and political departments; and has used the baojia (household registration) system of inspecting ID cards left over from the Japanese occupation era to restrict and deprive the overseas Chinese masses of their personal, residential, and freedom of movement. Philippine government military police often stop and search overseas Chinese for their residence permits and alien registration certificates. If an overseas Chinese person enters or leaves the city area and forgets to carry these documents, he is in danger of being extorted or arrested. The Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (the highest special agent organ and international intelligence agency in the Philippines) can summon overseas Chinese at any time for exhausting interrogation. Philippine plainclothes detectives can also enter overseas Chinese shops or residences at any time without a court summons or warrant, or any legal procedures, using pretexts such as searching for "military weapons," "propaganda newspapers and periodicals," "illegal entry," "relationship with the People's Anti-Japanese Army," etc., to conduct ransacking inspections, and take the opportunity to loot jewelry and property. Even if no "criminal" evidence is found, they can still use the name on the blacklist to threaten and extort money. This extortion ranges from tens of thousands of pesos to hundreds or tens of pesos. Up to now, hundreds of overseas Chinese have been victimized. Among them, some have been deported, some young people in the sports world have been falsely accused of murder and arrested and illegally beaten and detained, some art workers have been arrested, interrogated, and monitored for violating population regulations, some have been falsely accused of privately hiding military weapons, and some have been accused of providing assistance to the People's Anti-Japanese Army, and some have been accused of being "Chinese communists" or "Chinese communist suspects." They have all been subjected to intimidation, searches, arrests, detention, beatings, and extortion of large sums of money. As for the small and medium-sized businessmen who have been persecuted but dare not speak out for fear of retaliation from the Kuomintang bandit gang, it is not known how many there are.

　　The persecution suffered by overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings

　　Since Roxas took office in 1946, the Philippine reactionary authorities have colluded with Kuomintang special agents to do their utmost to destroy progressive overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings. First, Kuomintang special agents intimidated the parents of students in progressive schools, spread rumors, and blockaded the finances of progressive schools; they used phone calls or anonymous letters to intimidate readers and advertising subscribers of progressive newspapers. Then, on September 5, 1946, a large team of Philippine armed military police surrounded overseas Chinese newspaper offices and schools, collectively arresting journalists, staff, and teachers. Those arrested at the time included all employees of the Overseas Chinese Herald and the Overseas Chinese Business Daily, as well as all staff members of the United Middle School, Hongguang School, and Jianguo Elementary School. The above-mentioned two newspaper offices were forced to close down one after another. In the past three years, the progressive schools that have been forced to close down include the Namota Overseas Chinese Elementary School, Manila United Middle School, Yili Shi Ba Overseas Chinese School, Gaolao Province Overseas Chinese School, Luoshenna Voluntary School, Dongyashi Timely Elementary School, and Manila Jianguo Elementary School; the schools that have been forcibly taken over by the Kuomintang special agent bandits in collusion with the Philippine reactionary military police with armed force include the Baguo Guanghua Elementary School and the Brazil District Zhonghua Elementary School. In the past three years, most of the progressive teachers in Manila and other provinces and cities have been forced to resign, dismissed, and even forced to flee.

　　A series of framed cases and the destruction of overseas Chinese industry and commerce

　　The Philippine reactionary government also uses various anti-Chinese bills to achieve its goal of destroying the legitimate commercial rights of overseas Chinese. Some of these bills have already been implemented, while others are being proposed. At present, in addition to the Western Accounting Case, which has been implemented since 1938, there is also the Filipino Vendor Case, which was passed by the Manila City Council in 1941 and implemented last year. In the seven vegetable markets in Manila, there are more than 3,000 overseas Chinese-run stalls, each usually employing three people. Therefore, after the implementation of this case, more than 9,000 overseas Chinese small businessmen were forced to lose their jobs. If each person has an average of a family of five, then more than 45,000 overseas Chinese businessmen and their families are affected. This spring, the Philippine Congress passed the so-called National Land Act. This bill will rob the overseas Chinese of the land they have owned for hundreds of years, even the real estate of schools, hospitals, and public welfare undertakings will not be exempt.

　　In addition, there are the following anti-Chinese bills that have been proposed long ago and are waiting to be passed:

　　1. Filipino Retailer Case: The actual purpose of this bill is to prohibit overseas Chinese from engaging in small-scale retail business, and retail business is the most common type of business run by overseas Chinese in the Philippines. In Manila and its suburbs alone, there are more than 3,000 overseas Chinese retailers. If this case is passed and implemented, most of the overseas Chinese small and medium-sized businessmen will be forced to lose their jobs.

　　2. Filipino Labor Case: This case stipulates that 60% of all employees and staff in foreign factories, workshops, shops, and agencies must be Filipinos. If this case is passed, the original overseas Chinese employees and staff will also be forced to lose their jobs in large numbers.

　　3. Filipino Medicine Merchant Case: This case stipulates that only Americans and Filipinos can engage in the business of selling Western medicine. If this case is passed, the overseas Chinese who are engaged in the Western medicine business today will be forced to close down.

　　4. National Flag Law: It stipulates that except for Americans and Filipinos, overseas Chinese cannot do business with the Philippine government.

　　5. Import and Export Trade Control Case.

　　6. Overseas Chinese Remittance Restriction Decree: It limits the remittances of overseas Chinese to support their families to no more than one hundred pesos per month.

　　In addition to the above-mentioned anti-Chinese bills, Philippine health bureau personnel often use the pretext of inspecting the hygiene of shops or residences or the cleanliness of restaurants, and tax bureau auditors use the pretext of inspecting the account books of overseas Chinese businesses to make things difficult for and extort overseas Chinese businessmen. Customs officers use the pretext of inspecting luggage to harass and openly extort money from overseas Chinese passengers entering and leaving the country. As for the corruption of the Philippine courts and the demand for bribes from overseas Chinese, it is an open secret. Even the Philippine police openly collude with cutpurses (robbers who defraud money on the road) and robbers to specifically rob overseas Chinese on public buses.

　　All kinds of difficulties and abuse in entering and leaving the Philippines

　　Since the United States occupied the Philippines in 1898, overseas Chinese entering and leaving the Philippines have been restricted by the harsh immigration regulations of the US-Philippine government. Since the Kuomintang bandit gang colluded with the US-Philippine reactionary government in the Philippines, the abuse suffered by overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country has become even more aggravated. Now, any overseas Chinese person who returns to the country must apply one month in advance and wait for the investigation of various departments of the Philippine reactionary government. After obtaining the return certificate from the Kuomintang consulate, they must also obtain certificates from the Philippine police局, the Army Intelligence Department, and the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation. In this process, each person must submit seven photos and make forty-eight fingerprints. Finally, they must also be checked against the blacklist. If their name is on the list or their name is spelled similarly to someone on the list, they will be subjected to various difficulties. Even if they have nothing to do with it, they must still pay money before they can obtain the Philippine government's return certificate to purchase boat tickets or plane tickets. Overseas Chinese returning to the Philippines will also be checked against the blacklist. If their name is on the list or their name is spelled similarly, they will be detained immediately. Even ordinary overseas Chinese who have nothing to do with it, whether they are new or old customers, are all treated as prisoners and sent to water prisons for detention, waiting for bail and completion of entry procedures before they are allowed to be released. All the luggage of overseas Chinese is sent to the customs warehouse, waiting to be released before they are allowed to collect it. When collecting luggage, they will be subjected to various difficulties and extortion from customs officials and multiple extortions from customs police. Therefore, everyone calls the Philippine government's customs a gateway to hell. Whenever there is a port quarantine, the abuse suffered by overseas Chinese passengers from the Philippine customs quarantine officers is unprecedented in any country. Any passenger must have a square glass tube inserted into their anus to scrape feces for inspection, even female passengers are no exception. In addition, the Philippine government has a limit of only 500 overseas Chinese immigrants per year, and a law prohibiting overseas Chinese who were unable to return to the Philippines due to the war in 1941 from returning to the Philippines again. All of this makes the overseas Chinese remaining in the Philippines feel excruciating pain.

　　The deprivation of freedom of assembly and association

　　The freedom of assembly and association of overseas Chinese has been almost completely deprived. At present, any overseas Chinese community, organization, or school that wants to hold a meeting, speech, or parade must apply to the city police station one week in advance. In the past three years, the overseas Chinese communities that have been forced to stop their activities include the Philippine Overseas Chinese Labor Federation and its dozens of trade union organizations, and the Chinese Hall, an organization for labor welfare undertakings, has also been forced to stop operating. In addition, the organizations that have been forced to disband or stop their activities include the Veterans Association of the Overseas Chinese Guerrilla Detachment, the Veterans Association of the Anti-Japanese Elimination of Traitors Volunteer Army, the Liberation Drama Club, and the Hongmen Youth League. Now, progressive overseas Chinese youth, students, women, and employee groups in Manila and other provinces and cities have been unable to continue their activities due to the joint oppression of the US, the Philippines, and Chiang.

　　Today, the broad masses of overseas Chinese in the Philippines and overseas Chinese businessmen with a sense of justice express extreme indignation at the fascist behavior of the Philippine reactionary government in persecuting overseas Chinese, but they believe that their current suffering will be temporary, because the broad masses of the Philippine people are increasingly aware that the actions of the Philippine rulers to provoke the friendship between the Chinese and Philippine peoples by排华 are merely to divert the attention of the Philippine people and maintain their reactionary rule, and in order to win the true independence and freedom of the Philippines, the friendly unity of the Chinese and Philippine peoples is an indispensable element. At the same time, the great victory of the motherland's revolution and the birth of the People's Republic of China have given the overseas Chinese great encouragement. The motherland has stood up like a giant, and the insulted overseas Chinese will surely stand up soon.

　　国民党匪帮勾结美、菲迫害华侨
    马尼拉通讯
    在美帝国主义的工具——菲律宾反动政府的排华政策下，菲律宾十八万华侨一向生活在屈辱与困苦中。尤其在匪首蒋介石于今年七月在碧瑶与季里诺会晤以后，国民党匪帮驻菲大使、特务头子阵质平与季里诺政府合作，加紧于侨胞的迫害之后，菲律宾侨胞的处境是愈来愈险恶了。
    菲政府的军警与特务机关（包括菲陆军情报部、保安侦探部、首都警察局侦察部、国家调查局密探部、移民局特务总队、总统府特务队），经常以各种借口，对居留菲律宾的华侨，进行搜查、讯问与逮捕。只马尼拉市区内，在十月份上半个月被菲警特务搜查、诬陷、以驱逐出境相威胁而进行敲诈勒索的侨商，已达五十余家。其他菲律宾各省市侨胞受迫害的，也日有所闻。而在菲的国民党匪徒无耻的从中助纣为虐，迫害自己的同胞。他们给菲政府特务机关提供“情报”，充当菲特务机关的密探或眼线，捏造证据，伪造证人，甚至直接给菲政府特务带路，去按址进行搜捕。据不完全的统计，三年以来，国民党匪帮驻菲的使领馆曾先后向菲政府提供侨胞的黑名单达二千余名，并提供了有关人的照片。今天，在菲岛的侨胞，只要他不苟同国民党反动派的卖国行为，只要他不参加反共组织，他便会被目为“华共”，时刻有被捕的危险。最近，菲政府断然地把在一九四六年秋便被以“华共”和“接济菲民抗军”罪名逮捕、虐待与拘禁了两三年的描东牙示及时小学的校长吕俊庆、董事长陈永田、董事黄珠盘、王志明、黄世扁等五人，经由移民局长非法裁判后驱逐出境，送到未解放前的厦门交匪帮处死。幸而厦门匪帮内部动摇，欲改过自新的分子释放了他们，使他们安全地到达了解放区。
    菲反动政府一年来更勾结国民党特务匪徒派人检查华侨书信电报，广泛收揽国民党特务和流氓、打手，充当非军政各部门的密探和眼线；并沿用日寇时代遗留下来的保甲检查身份证的制度，来限制和剥夺华侨大众的人身、居住与出门的自由。菲政府军警常拦途搜查华侨的居住证与外侨登记证，万一华侨出入市区，忘记把这些证件随带在身上，便有被敲诈或逮捕的危险。菲国家调查局（菲最高特务机关与国际情报机关），可以随时传讯华侨，进行疲劳轰炸式的审问。菲便衣侦探，也不必有法庭的传票或传票，或任何法律手续，随时可以进入华侨商店或住宅，用搜查“军火武器”、“宣传品报刊”、“非法入境”、“与民抗军有关系”等等借口，进行翻衣倒箧的检查，并乘机劫掠珠饰财物。即使搜不出任何“犯罪”证据，亦可以黑名单上有名为威胁而进行敲诈勒索。这种勒索多者达万数千元，少者亦百数十元不等。到现在为止，被害侨胞达数百人。其中有被驱逐出境者，有体育界青年被诬指为杀人犯而被捕及遭非法殴打拘禁者，有艺术工作者被指违反人口条例被拘捕、审讯监视者，有被栽诬私藏军火者，有被指为接济民抗军者，有被指为“华共”或“华共嫌疑”者。他们都曾遭受威吓、搜捕、拘禁、毒打、被勒索去大批的金钱。至于遭受迫害但因害怕国民党匪帮报复而不敢声张的中小商人，还不知有多少。
    华侨文化教育事业所受到的迫害
    自一九四六年罗哈斯粉墨登台以来，菲律宾反动当局即与国民党特务狼狈为奸，对进步的华侨文化教育事业竭力进行摧残。首先由国民党特务对进步学校的学生家长进行威吓，散播谣言，封锁进步学校的经济；用打电话或写匿名信方式，威吓进步报纸的读者与广告订户。接着，便有一九四六年九月五日菲大队武装军警包围华侨报馆、学校，集体逮捕新闻记者、职工和教职员。当时被捕的，有华侨导报、侨商公报全体员工，联合中学、洪光学校、建国小学三校全部职员。上述两报馆先后被迫歇业。三年来，被迫停办的进步学校有那摸沓示华侨小学、马尼拉联合中学、艺礼示八华侨学校、高老省华侨学校、罗申那义务学校，描东牙示及时小学，和马尼拉建国小学；被国民党特务匪徒串同菲反动军警用武装接收的有巴阁光华小学、巴西区中华小学。三年来，马尼拉以至各省市的进步教师，大部分被迫离职、解聘、甚至被迫逃亡。
    一连串的化案与摧残华侨工商业
    菲反动派政府对华侨正当的商业权利，也利用各种各样的排华法案，来达到他们摧残的目的。这些法案有的已经付诸实施，有的正在提出。目前除了一九三八年已经实施的西文簿记案外，还有一九四一年马尼拉市议会通过并于去年付之实施的菜市摊商菲化案。在马尼拉市七个菜市中，华侨经营摊商的达三千余家，每家通常有三个人，因此，此案实施后，被迫失业的华侨小商人达九千多人，每个人如果平均有一个五口之家，则受影响的侨商和眷属则有四万五千人以上。今年春间，菲国会通过了所谓土地国有案。这一法案将劫夺华侨数百年来所拥有的土地，即使是学校、医院、公共福利事业的地产，也不能例外。
    此外，还有以下早被提出只待通过的排华法案：
    一、零售商菲化案：这个法案的实际目的，就是禁止华侨经营小本零售业，而华侨在菲经营的商业，却以零售业为最多。单是马尼拉市和近郊，就有华侨零售商三千余家。此案如被通过执行，则大部分的华侨中小商人都要被迫失业。
    二、劳工菲化案：该案规定所有外侨工厂、作坊、商店、机关的所有职工雇员，百分之六十要用菲人。该案若被通过，则原有华侨职工雇员，亦将大量被迫失业。
    三、西药商菲化案：该案规定只有美国人及菲人才可以经营西药买卖。此案如果通过，则今天经营西药业的华侨都要被迫停业。
    四、国旗律：其中规定除了美国人与菲律宾人外，华侨不能与菲政府做各种买卖。
    五、出入口贸易统制案。
    六、华侨汇款限制法令：限定华侨赡养家庭的汇款，每月不能超过一百比索。
    除了上述几种排华法案以外，菲卫生局人员经常借口检查商店或住宅卫生或饮食店清洁，税务局查帐员借口检查华商帐簿，对华侨商人多方刁难与勒索。海关人员则对华侨出入口旅客，借口检查行李，进行留难与公开的勒索。至于菲法庭的贪污与要求华侨贿赂，更是公开的秘密。甚至菲警察也公然勾结剪绺（拦路诈财的歹徒）、劫贼，在公共汽车上专门打劫华侨。
    出入菲境的种种刁难与虐待
    自美国于一八九八年占领菲律宾以来，华侨出入菲国境，即已受到美菲政府苛刻的移民条例的限制。自国民党匪帮在菲律宾勾结美菲反动政府以来，华侨出入国境的遭受虐待，更变本加厉。现在，任何华侨回国，都要在动身一个月前先行申请，静候菲反动政府各部门的调查。在取得国民党领事馆的回国证件后，还要取得菲警局、陆军情报部、菲国家调查局的证明书。在这过程中，每人要缴相片七张，打手印四十八次。最后，还要被检对黑名单，如果单上有名或名字与单上某一人名拼音类似，那就要遭受多方的留难。即使全无关系，也仍要在花钱之后，才能领得菲政府的回国证去购买船票或飞机票。返菲的侨胞，也要被检对黑名单，如名单内有名或姓名拼音类似，就立即被拘留。即使全无关系的普通侨胞，不管是新客或旧客，一律都被当作囚犯，押送水牢拘禁，等候取保及办完入口手续，始准释放，所有侨胞的行李，一律被送海关货仓库，候释放后才准去领取。领取行李时，又要被关员多方刁难勒索与关警的数重敲诈。所以大家都称菲政府的海关为鬼门关。凡遇禁港检疫时，华侨旅客遭受菲海关验疫官的虐待，更是任何一个国家所未有。任何一个旅客，都要被一根四方的玻璃管插入肛门，刮粪检查，即使女客也不例外。此外，菲政府还有华侨移民每年只准五百名的入口限制，与禁止一九四一年因战争关系无法返菲的侨胞再度回菲的律例。这一切所有，使得留菲的华侨，感到切肤的痛苦。
    集会结社自由的被剥夺
    华侨的集会结社自由，几乎已被完全剥夺。目前任何华侨社团、机关、学校，如要举行集会演讲或游行，都须在一星期前先行向市政府警察局具函申请。三年来被迫停止活动的华侨社团，有菲律宾华侨劳工联合会和它所属的几十个职工会组织，劳工福利事业的组织中华厅，也被迫停办。此外被迫解散或停止活动的，有华侨游击支队退伍同志会、抗日锄奸义勇军退伍同志会、解放剧社、洪门青年团等。现在，马尼拉和各省市的进步的华侨青年、学生、妇女、职工团体，因美、菲、蒋的联合压迫，业已无法继续活动。
    今天，在菲的广大华侨群众和有正义感的华侨商人，对于菲反动政府这种迫害华侨的法西斯行为，表示极端愤激，但他们相信：他们目前的苦难将是暂时的，因为菲律宾广大的人民正在日益认识到：菲律宾统治者力图以排华来挑拨中菲两国人民友谊的行动，不过是为了转移菲律宾人民的视线，维持其反动统治，而为了争得菲律宾的真正独立与自由，则中菲两民族的友好团结，乃是不可缺少的要素。同时祖国革命的伟大胜利和中华人民共和国的诞生，给予侨胞以莫大的鼓舞。祖国已象一个巨人一样地站立起来了，海外被侮辱的侨胞们也必然将很快地站立起来。
