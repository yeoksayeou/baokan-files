    Support the Issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds!
    Opinions on the Issuance of Victory Bonds
    Tan Pingshan
    The Chinese People's Liberation War is coming to a victorious end, and the People's Republic of China is about to be truly unified. Following this, the two major tasks of establishing and consolidating the new China, namely developing production and improving culture, will be implemented gradually in a planned and step-by-step manner. However, from the victorious completion of the Liberation War to the process of peaceful construction, there must be a considerably long and arduous road, and there will certainly be considerable difficulties along this road. This is an inevitable difficulty in victory. However, such difficulties can definitely be overcome, because the great power of the people, which was able to destroy the reactionary old China, will certainly have the power to overcome all kinds of difficulties and build a progressive new China.

    The difficulties in the process of building a new China may not be limited to one aspect, but what everyone currently feels is the recent phenomenon of rising prices and unstable people's lives. Vice Premier Chen Yun has clearly and specifically pointed out the reasons for this temporary difficulty and how to overcome it, which is worthy of everyone's admiration. He explained that the reason for the rise in prices is: "With the victory of the People's Liberation Army and the liberation of vast areas, the government's fiscal expenditure has greatly increased, while fiscal revenue has not kept up with the needs of expenditure, resulting in excessive issuance of banknotes." He also said: "The people of the whole country are encouraged by the victory of the People's Liberation Army and understand the difficulties of the People's Government in the Liberation War, but they also hope that the government will try to stabilize financial prices even in the face of difficulties. Therefore, the government cannot rely solely on increasing currency issuance in its fiscal measures." He further said: "The role of issuing public bonds is to make up for part of the fiscal deficit. If the issuance of public bonds reduces the deficit, resulting in an improvement in the value of the currency and prices next year compared to this year, it will not only benefit the working people who rely on wages and the military and government personnel, but also the legitimate operations of industry and commerce."

    I completely agree with Vice Premier Chen's explanation of the reasons for rising prices, and I fully support the proposed method of issuing indexed public bonds to solve temporary difficulties. Due to the expansion of the liberated areas and the large expenses, it is a natural result to issue more banknotes, leading to rising prices. However, some people think that continuing to issue more banknotes can relieve the difficulties, which is impossible. Because the more banknotes are issued, the higher the prices will rise, and the more unstable people's lives will become. Others believe that with the expansion of the newly liberated areas, taxes can be collected immediately, and the increase in state treasury revenue will naturally solve the economic difficulties, which is also impossible. Because the order in the newly liberated areas has not yet been restored, production is at a standstill, and excessive taxes are unaffordable. Therefore, the above two methods are not good, and only issuing indexed public bonds, issuing fewer banknotes, and tightening the currency can eliminate this harm. Moreover, these public bonds are indexed public bonds, which provide sufficient guarantees for purchasers, and will definitely gain the support of the people, and the sales will definitely be smooth. This is the reason why I support the issuance of indexed public bonds from an economic point of view. As for the political aspect, our current New Democratic regime is a people's democratic regime, and it is also a joint dictatorship of workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. The establishment and consolidation of this regime should be the joint responsibility of the four classes. Today, in the People's Liberation War and the establishment of the new regime, workers and peasants have made the greatest contributions. Workers lead peasants to destroy the reactionary regime by armed force, and they have shown great achievements in restoring the production destroyed during the war amidst all kinds of hardships, which is enough to prove that the working class is the most powerful pillar of the New Democratic regime. Under the leadership of the workers, the peasant masses have engaged in life-and-death struggles with the remaining feudal forces, and their sacrifices have been very great. Today, when the Liberation War is about to be completed quickly, they are still bearing 20 percent of the public grain to support the new regime. In this way, the peasants have also made their greatest efforts. The economic difficulties that have arisen in the process of destruction and construction must be shared and overcome by the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. Naturally, the issuance of indexed public bonds will place more of the burden on the people in the cities, but this is a burden that all Chinese people should bear. The so-called rights must be accompanied by obligations, which is a very clear principle. Therefore, I believe that the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, as well as the general public, will definitely support the issuance of indexed public bonds and will actively purchase public bonds in the future. Therefore, I think that the issuance of indexed public bonds, especially for the petty bourgeoisie and industrialists and businessmen residing in cities, as well as the general public, is a solemn test and also a broad education. This is even more noteworthy.

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！
　　对发行胜利公债的意见
    谭平山
    中国人民解放战争快要胜利结束了，中华人民共和国，快要真正的统一了，随之而建立及巩固新中国的两大任务，即发展生产和提高文化两种主要工作，快要有计划有步骤而陆续实行了。但是从胜利完成解放战争到和平建设过程，中间必经过相当长远的艰苦的道路，而且这道路上一定会经过相当的困难，这是胜利中必有的困难。只是这种困难，一定可以克服的，因为人民伟大的力量，能彀摧毁反动的旧中国，必然一定有力量克服各种困难，建设进步的新中国。
    建设新中国过程中的困难，也许不止一端，但摆在目前人人所感觉到的，就是最近因为物价高涨，人民生活颇不安定的现象。这种暂时困难发生的原因，和如何克服这种困难的方法，陈云副总理已经明确而具体的指出，这是值得人人佩服的。他说明物价高涨的原因，是：“随着人民解放军胜利和广大地区的获得解放，政府财政支出大大增加，而财政的收入远赶不上支出的需要，因而钞票发行过多。”又说：“全国人民对于解放军的胜利，欢欣鼓舞，也理解到人民政府在解放战争中的困难，但是又希望政府即使在困难中也要设法使金融物价比较稳定。因此，政府在财政措施上不能单纯依靠增发通货。”又说：“发行公债的作用在于弥补一部分财政赤字。如果发行公债，缩小赤字的结果，使明年的币值与物价比今年改善，则不但对于靠工资生活的劳动人民和军政公教人员有好处，而且对于工商业的正当经营也有好处。”
    我对于陈副总理所说的物价高涨原因是完全同意的，所提出发行折实公债，以解决暂时的困难的办法，是完全拥护的。由于解放区扩大，支出浩繁，不得不多发钞票以致使物价高涨，这是很自然的结果。但有人以为仍继续增发钞票，可以解除困难，这是不可能的。因为钞票愈多，物价愈高涨，民生愈不能安定。又有人以为新解放区扩大，税收马上可以征收，国库收入增加，经济困难自然解决，这也是不可能的。因为新解放区秩序尚未恢复，生产停顿，过重的税捐是负担不起的。所以以上两个方法都是不好的，只有发行折实公债，少发钞票，紧缩通货，方可以除去这种弊害。而且这公债，是折实公债，对购买者是有充分保证的，一定取得人民的拥护，推销一定很顺利，这是从经济方面我赞成发折实公债的理由。至于从政治方面来说，我们现在新民主主义的政权，是人民民主政权，也是工人、农民、中小资产阶级、民族资产阶级的共同专政的政权，建立这个政权，巩固这个政权，应该由四个阶级共同负责。今天在人民解放战争中和建立新政权中，工人、农民已有最大的供献，工人领导农民，武装摧毁反动政权，在千辛万苦中来恢复战时所破坏的生产，已经表示出伟大的成就，足以证明工人阶级是新民主主义政权最有力的支柱。农民群众在工人领导下，与封建残余力量，作生死斗争，牺牲已经很重大了。在今天解放战争很快要完成的时候，还负担百分之二十的公粮来支持新政权，这样，农民也已经尽了最大的努力了。而在破坏与建设过程中所发生经济的困难，必须由全国人民共同努力来分担与克服。自然，折实公债的发行，负担自然会多落在城市的人民身上，但这是凡属中国人民应该有的负担，所谓有权利一定必有义务，这是很明白的道理。因此我相信城市中小资产阶级与民族资产阶级，以及一般市民，对于折实公债的发行，一定是拥护的，对将来公债的购买，也一定是踊跃的。我因此对于发行折实公债，特别是对于居留城市小资产阶级和工商业者，以及一般市民，是一种严正的考验，也是一种广泛的教育。这更足令人注意的。
