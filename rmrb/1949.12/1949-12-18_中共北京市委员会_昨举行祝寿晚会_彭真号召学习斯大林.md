　　CPC Beijing Municipal Committee
  　Holds Birthday Celebration Soirée Yesterday
  　Peng Zhen Calls for Learning from Stalin
    [Beijing News] The Chinese Communist Party's Beijing Municipal Committee held an evening gathering for cadres yesterday (the 17th) to celebrate Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday. Around 6 PM, cadres entered the venue one after another, facing the red banner at the front of the stage that read "Long Live Stalin" and the giant, glittering "Longevity" character, filled with boundless heartfelt joy. Peng Zhen, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, with a smile, delivered a report in the midst of warm applause to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday. He began by saying: Stalin is our teacher, our guide, our closest comrade. The liberation of the people of the world and the Chinese people is inseparable from the name "Stalin." It is a cause for joy for all the people of the world that Comrade Stalin is in good spirits and healthy. We celebrate his "longevity without bounds." He then explained the relationship between Stalin and the Chinese Communist Party and the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, saying that the Chinese Communist Party was established from the beginning according to the principles of the Soviet Bolshevik Party's party building, and therefore it was able to lead the Chinese revolution. Stalin gave valuable instructions on the Chinese people's armed struggle and the united front, and he listed the great role that these instructions played at critical junctures in the Chinese revolution. Next, Peng Zhen specifically listed how Chairman Mao guided the Chinese revolution based on Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism, and developed Marxism-Leninism. As he reported to everyone with a joyful and excited expression: "Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Stalin are now meeting in Moscow!" The applause from the audience continued for a long time. Peng Zhen then shouted: The victory and success of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from Chairman Mao, and even more inseparable from Stalin. Finally, he put forward the slogans for celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday: "Learn from Stalin," "Learn from the Soviet Union," "Long Live Stalin," and "Build China into a democratic and happy new country." After Peng Zhen's speech, a Peking opera performance was presented to add to the festivities.

　　中共北京市委员会
  　昨举行祝寿晚会
  　彭真号召学习斯大林
    【北京讯】中国共产党北京市委员会庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰，昨（十七）日举行干部晚会。晚六时许干部陆续入场，面对着台前“斯大林万寿无疆”的红色横额及金光闪烁的巨幅“寿”字，泛起无限衷心愉快。市委书记彭真面带微笑在热烈掌声中为庆祝斯大林七十寿辰作了报告，他首先说：斯大林是我们的教员、我们的带路人、我们最亲切的同志，世界人民和中国人民的解放，是和“斯大林”三个字分不开的。斯大林同志精神好、身体健康是全世界人民都高兴的，我们庆祝他“万寿无疆”。接着他说明斯大林和中国共产党及中国人民解放事业的关系，中国共产党一开始就依照苏联布尔塞维克党建党的原则建立起来的，因此它才能够领导中国革命，斯大林对于中国人民武装斗争、统一战线，都有宝贵的指示，并列举了斯大林这些指示在中国革命紧急关头所起的伟大作用。接着，彭真特别列举了毛主席如何根据马克思、列宁、斯大林主义来指导中国革命，并且发展了马列主义。当着他以愉快兴奋的神情报告大家说：“毛泽东同志和斯大林同志现在在莫斯科见面了！”台下掌声历久不息。彭真继即高呼：中国革命的胜利成功和毛主席分不开，更和斯大林分不开。最后，他提出庆祝斯大林七十寿辰的口号，“要学习斯大林”，“学习苏联”，“斯大林万寿无疆”。“把中国建设成民主、幸福的新国家”。彭真讲话后，即由平剧院演戏助兴。
