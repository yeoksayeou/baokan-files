　　Lighthouse
    Lila Sastrowardojo, Representative of Indonesian Women at the Asian Women's Conference
    I have seen the film of the May Day celebration in Moscow.
    I saw Comrade Stalin watching the parade pass by.
    I saw him looking at the planes led by his son.
    I saw him looking at the happy masses of people, light shining in his eyes, a benevolent smile on his lips.
    I saw that film again in Beijing.
    Again, I saw him watching the parade and the planes.
    And now, I am only waiting to see him again,
    As I have often imagined, this great teacher and comrade,
    Smiling at his happy people like a father, his face full of kindness.
    I wish him to stand firm among his people like a rock for a long time, and for us, the oppressed people, like a lighthouse, illuminating our dark path to victory.

　　灯塔
    亚洲妇代会、印尼妇女代表  丽拉·索西洛
    我看过莫斯科庆祝五一节的影片。
    我看到斯大林同志望着检阅的队伍经过。
    我看到他望着他儿子所率领的机群。
    我看到他望着快乐的人民群众，他眼中显露着光芒，嘴上泛着一种充满良善的微笑。
    在北京我又一次看到了那部影片。
    我又一次看到他望着检阅的队伍和机群。
    而现在，我只等待着再看到他一次，
    象我曾经常常所想象的那样，这位伟大的导师和同志，
    象父亲一般对他的快乐的人民微笑，脸上充满着慈祥。
    我祝福他长远地象磐石一般屹立在他的人民中间，而对于我们，被压迫的人民，象一盏灯塔，照亮了我们黑暗的道路走向胜利。
