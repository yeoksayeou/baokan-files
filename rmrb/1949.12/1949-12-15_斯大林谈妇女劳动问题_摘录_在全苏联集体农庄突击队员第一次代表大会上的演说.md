　　Stalin on the Question of Women's Labor
    —Excerpt from "Speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers"
    (February 19, 1933)
    I want to talk about the women's issue, the issue of female collective farm members. Comrades, the women's issue in collective farms is a major issue. I know that many of you despise women and even mock them. But, comrades, this is a mistake, a serious mistake. The problem here is not only that women account for half the population. The primary issue is that the collective farm movement has promoted many outstanding and capable women to leadership positions. You only need to look at this congress, look at the composition of the delegates, to know that women have long since risen from being backward to being advanced. Women are a tremendous force in collective farms. To bury this force is a crime. Our responsibility is to promote women in collective farms and utilize this force.

    Of course, the Soviet government had a slight misunderstanding with female collective farm members not long ago. This was about the issue of dairy cows. But now, the dairy cow issue has been properly resolved, and thus this misunderstanding has been eliminated. (Prolonged applause). We have ensured that the majority of collective farm members have a dairy cow per household. In another year or two, there will not be a single collective farm member without their own dairy cow. We Bolsheviks always try to ensure that every household of our collective farm members has a dairy cow. (Prolonged applause).

    As for the female collective farm members themselves, they should remember the role and significance of collective farms for women, and should remember that only in collective farms is it possible for them to obtain equal status with men. Without collective farms, there is no equality; but within collective farms, there is equal rights for men and women. Please let the female collective farm member comrades remember this point, and please let them cherish the collective farm system as they would cherish the apple of their eye. (Prolonged applause).

　　斯大林谈妇女劳动问题
    ——摘录“在全苏联集体农庄突击队员第一次代表大会上的演说”
    （一九三三年二月十九日）
    我要说说妇女问题，说说集体农庄女庄员问题。同志们，集体农庄中的妇女问题是一个大问题。我知道，你们中间有许多人是轻视妇女，甚至于嘲笑妇女的。可是，同志们，这是一个错误，这是一个严重的错误。这里，问题不仅在于妇女占人口半数。问题首先是在于集体农庄运动已提拔出许多出色的能干的妇女来担任领导职务。你们只要看看这次代表大会，看看代表成份，就会知道妇女早已由落后者升为先进者了。妇女在集体农庄中是个巨大的力量。埋没这个力量，就是犯罪了。我们的责任，就是要在集体农庄中提拔妇女，运用这个力量。
    固然，苏维埃政权在不久以前是与集体农庄女庄员发生过一点小小的误会。这就是关于乳牛问题。可是，现在，乳牛问题已经妥当解决了，于是这个误会也就消释了。（长时间的鼓掌）。我们已经做到使大多数集体农庄庄员每家都有一条乳牛了。再过一两年，就不会再有一个集体农庄庄员没有自家的乳牛了。我们布尔什维克总是要设法使我们的集体农庄庄员每家都有一条乳牛的。（长时间的鼓掌）。
    至于集体农庄女庄员自己，她们就应当记着集体农庄对于妇女的作用与意义，应当记着她们只有在集体农庄里面才有可能获得与男子平等的地位。没有集体农庄，就没有平等；而在集体农庄里面，就有男女平权。请集体农庄女庄员同志们记着这一点，请她们要象爱护瞳珠一样来爱护集体农庄制度。（长时间的鼓掌）。
