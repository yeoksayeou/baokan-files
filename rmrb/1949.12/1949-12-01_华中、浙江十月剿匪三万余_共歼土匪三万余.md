    【Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th】The bandit suppression troops under the Zhejiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, annihilated 11,040 bandits in October, including 561 killed or wounded, 5,657 captured including bandit Wang Yunpei, "Deputy Commander of Zhejiang Security," and others; those who surrendered included bandit Xie Mingqiang, "Commander of the Zhejiang West General Column of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army," and bandit Yang Biao, "Commander-in-Chief of the People's Restoration Army," and others, totaling over 4,822 individuals. Currently, large bandit gangs have been basically eliminated in most areas of Zhejiang Province. In early October, all main forces and local armed forces, in accordance with the military region's instructions on thoroughly completing the bandit suppression mission in Zhejiang, uniformly deployed a focused and step-by-step comprehensive bandit suppression operation, carrying out bandit suppression work in four clearing areas: the Tianmu Mountain area, the Jinhua and Jiangshan area, the Linhai and Wenzhou area, and the Siming Mountain and Shaoxing area, as well as the area south of Taihu Lake and the Hangxian Second Independent Clearing Area. When the various units began clearing operations, they first concentrated their forces to carry out key clearing operations, combining military suppression with political disintegration to give the bandit gangs a destructive blow; then they separately stationed, searched, and cleared in designated areas with a focus. In the clearing operations, each unit carried out the dual tasks of a combat team and a work team, suppressing bandits while cooperating with local work teams to widely publicize and mobilize the masses, establish district and township governments, and mobilize farmers' armed self-defense. In the past month, the bandit suppression struggle has achieved significant results. Large bandit gangs in the Linhai and Wenzhou areas have been basically eliminated. Bandit Wang Yunpei, "Deputy Commander of Zhejiang Province Security and Director of the Southern Zhejiang Administrative Office" and "Commander of the Southern Zhejiang Pacification Army," and bandit county heads of Yuhuan, Yueqing, Yongjia, and Fuding counties, as well as bandit leaders of the "Southern Zhejiang Pacification Army" Chen Qingshang and Wang Jixue, have all been captured or forced to surrender. In the Tianmu Mountain area, the large bandit gangs have been completely eliminated. Bandit Xu Zhendong, Commander of the "Zhejiang-Anhui Advance Column of the Youth National Salvation Army of the Ministry of National Defense," has been killed, and Deputy Commander Xu Jianzhong has been captured. A small number of scattered remnants are being searched and cleared. Large bandit gangs in other clearing areas such as the Jinhua and Jiangshan area, the Siming Mountain and Shaoxing area in eastern Zhejiang, and the area south of Taihu Lake have also been largely eliminated. Most bandit leaders have been arrested or forced to surrender. The people's governments in these areas have begun to be established, social order has gradually been consolidated, and extensive rural work is being carried out. At present, only the border mountainous areas and coastal islands still have residual bandit gangs. Some of them are disintegrating into smaller units, hiding weapons and materials, disguising themselves and going into hiding, or infiltrating cities to carry out counter-revolutionary activities; others are playing tricks of false surrender, attempting to preserve their strength. The military and civilians of the whole province are continuing to heighten their vigilance and are carrying out clearing operations against the remaining bandits.
