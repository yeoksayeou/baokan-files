    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 25th: Following the announcement of the establishment of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and the Xinjiang Military Region on the 17th, on the morning of the 18th, 50,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Dihua City, along with the People's Liberation Army, jointly held a celebratory parade. In the evening, a celebration was held with the participation of over 600 representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors, as well as government cadres. At the meeting, Bao Han, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and Saifuddin, Vice Chairman, spoke successively. They unanimously stated that the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, resolutely implement the Common Program, especially the ethnic policies stipulated therein, oppose great-Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and unite all ethnic groups and sectors to build a new Xinjiang for the people. Chairman Peng Dehuai of the Northwest Military and Political Committee pointed out in his speech that the establishment of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government is a victory for the people of Xinjiang and a concrete manifestation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Xinjiang. He then pointed out that the tasks of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government in the future are: politically, to gradually transform the old political organs at all levels below the provincial level, abolish the Baojia system, and gradually convene people's representative conferences at all levels on the basis of mobilizing the masses. Economically, to simplify the tax system, implement reasonable burdens, organize the people to develop industrial, agricultural, and livestock production, and improve the people's livelihood. Culturally, to implement a new democratic cultural and educational policy, strengthen national education, develop the culture and arts of all ethnic groups, strengthen sports and health facilities, and safeguard the people's health. Finally, he called on all government employees to thoroughly transform old ideas and old work styles, establish new ideas and new work styles, and truly become loyal servants of the people. Vice Chairman Zhang Zhizhong of the Northwest Military and Political Committee pointed out in his speech that the reason why the people of Xinjiang were able to achieve peaceful liberation should first of all be attributed to the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's policies, Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army throughout the country, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of Xinjiang, especially the people of the Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan areas. Wang Zhen, Secretary of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, emphasized in his speech that the current task of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government is to organize the people, eliminate open and hidden Kuomintang reactionaries, overcome financial and economic difficulties, and welcome the great production movement of 1950. The conference finally decided to send a telegram to Chairman Mao to pay tribute and to present a banner to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Commander Peng Dehuai.
