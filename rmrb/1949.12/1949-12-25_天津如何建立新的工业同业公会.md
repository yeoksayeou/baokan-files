　　How Tianjin Should Establish New Industrial Trade Associations
　　By Our Tianjin Correspondent, Wei Jin

　　Organizing private factories and businesses to conduct production under the guidance and supervision of the national planned economy is beneficial to both the country and the private factories and businesses.

　　During the period of enemy and puppet rule, private industries in Tianjin were organized into thirty-six industrial trade associations based on their respective industries. Most of these associations were controlled by powerful large factories. Some large factories used the position of the trade associations to collude with the enemy and puppets, engage in corruption and malpractice, oppress small factories, and monopolize the distribution of foreign exchange and raw materials. The enemy and puppets used the associations to collect exorbitant taxes and levies, extort money, and embezzle for their own benefit. Generally, factory owners had no good feelings toward the associations. After Tianjin's liberation, some association directors fled in fear of punishment, some retired from their positions, and some remained to deal with the aftermath, awaiting disposal. Seeing that the old associations were not functioning, members successively requested the establishment of new industrial trade associations. The government accepted this request from the factory owners. Tianjin is the largest industrial area in North China, with over 10,000 private factories. To place these factories under the guidance and supervision of the national planned economy for production, they must be truly organized. To this end, the government, after several consultations with the industrial sector, decided to establish new industrial trade associations under government guidance.

　　There are dozens of industries in the city's private sector. After consultations between the government and representatives from industry, it was decided to start with seven major industries on a trial basis, and then promote it comprehensively. Each industry had demands to establish new associations, and after a period of deliberation, a group of initiators quickly emerged. They first exposed the nature and shortcomings of the old associations in various industries, explained the significance and tasks of establishing new associations, and mobilized various industries to deliberate. Once deliberation was mature, the initiators would convene a conference, calling for the establishment of new associations. Various industries responded enthusiastically. At this time, they were divided into groups, democratically elected group leaders, established preparatory committees, registered members, reviewed member representatives, and held group discussions on opinions of the old associations and requirements of the new associations. Finally, they drafted the constitution of the new association, democratically elected the new association's committee members, and formally established the new association. From mid-August to the end of September, 53 industries in the city established new industrial trade associations (with four small industries forming trade association groups), including 11,600 private factories (excluding independent producers).

　　　　Work Already Done by the New Associations

　　After the new industrial trade associations were established, they quickly carried out various tasks. (1) Some industries have organized purchasing committees to uniformly purchase raw materials (such as the chemical dye industry purchasing picric acid and mirabilite from the Northeast; the match industry purchasing linden wood for matchsticks from the Northeast; the paper industry purchasing kok-saghyz and hemp stalks from the Northwest), reasonably allocating them, so that both large and small factories can get supplies. This eliminates middlemen exploitation and reduces production costs. (2) Mobilized and assisted the cigarette, paper, and pigment industries in signing collective labor contracts, enabling normal development of production. (3) Reflecting the opinions of various industries on taxation, electricity, transportation, etc., the government is discussing and handling these opinions with relevant departments. (4) Assisting the government in promoting work. For example, when holding the Workers' and Peasants' Fair, a wide range of exhibits were collected from thousands of factories, enriching the content of the fair; calling on the industry to provide disaster relief, and all factories enthusiastically donated.

　　　　Four Points of Experience

　　Experience has shown that in establishing new associations, it is necessary to proceed from one point to the whole, step by step, with a focus on concentrating efforts. First, successfully establish the associations of major industries (such as machinery, dyeing and weaving, cotton spinning, papermaking, and hardware metallurgy) because these industries are closely related to economic construction such as urban-rural mutual assistance and domestic and foreign exchanges, and then gradually popularize them to secondary industries, so that the new associations will not become a mere formality. Second, it is necessary to implement the spirit of democracy in establishing associations. In the past, the old associations were extremely undemocratic under the control of directors and supervisors. This time, under the guidance of the People's Government, various industries were actively and earnestly mobilized to put forward their requirements for the new associations, elect people they trusted to handle affairs, and clearly stipulate in the articles of association that members have the right to make criticisms and suggestions to the committee, which has won the support of various industries. For example, in the past, when the cotton ginning industry held meetings, only about 60% of the members attended, but this time more than 95% participated in the voting; in the chemical dye, machinery, dyeing and finishing and other industries, the attendance rate was 100%. Third, after the new associations are established, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen education, transform the remaining old ideas and styles of some committee members, and establish a spirit of serving the people. Fourth, state-owned enterprises should actively participate in the new associations, assist the development of private enterprises in the spirit of giving consideration to both public and private interests, give play to the leading role of state-owned enterprises, and further close the relationship between public and private sectors. For example, Tianjin State-owned Paper Pulp Company participated in the Papermaking Industry Association, assisting the papermaking industry in organizing an inspection group to the Northwest to purchase kok-saghyz and hemp stalks, solving the raw material difficulties of the papermaking industry, and enabling many private enterprises to clearly recognize that state-owned enterprises are actively helping the development of private enterprises.

　　天津如何建立新的工业同业公会
    驻津记者  维进
    把私营厂商组织起来，在国家计划经济指导监督下进行生产。这样，对于国家，对于私营厂商都有好处。
    在敌伪统治时期，天津市私营工业曾经按行业组成三十六个工业同业公会。这些公会大部分被有势力的大厂户所掌握。有些大厂户利用同业公会的地位，勾结敌伪，循私舞弊，欺压小厂，独占外汇和原料的分配权；敌伪则利用公会征＠税收，勒索敲诈，贪污自肥。一般厂户对公会都没有好感。天津解放后，公会理事有的畏罪潜逃，有的引退不动，有的支应差事，等待处理。会员鉴于旧公会不起作用，纷纷要求建立新的工业同业公会。政府接受了厂户这个要求。天津是华北最大的工业区，拥有一万余户私营工厂，要想把这些敌户置于国家计划经济指导监督下进行生产，必须真正组织起来。为此，政府与工业界经过多次协商，决定在政府指导下建立新的工业同业工会。
    全市私营工业共有数十个行业，经过政府与工业界人士磋商，决定先从七个主要行业开始试办，然后再全面推广。各行业都有建立新公会的要求，经过一度酝酿，很快涌现出一批发起人。他们首先在各行业间揭发旧公会的本质和毛病，说明建立新公会的意义和任务，发动各行业进行酝酿。酝酿成熟，即由发起人召开大会，号召建立新公会，各行业纷起响应，这时就划分小组，民选小组长，产生筹备委员会，登记会员，审查会员代表，分组讨论对旧公会的意见和对新公会的要求。最后拟出新公会的章程，民选新公会的委员，正式成立新公会。从八月中旬开始到九月底，全市五十三个行业都建立起新工业同业公会（内有四小行业组成同业小组），包括一万一千六百个私营工厂（独立生产者不在内）。
    　　　　新公会已经作的工作
    新工业同业公会建立起来后，很快开展了各种工作。（一）有些行业已组织采购委员会统一采购原料（如化学染料业自东北购得苦味酸、 芒硝等；火柴业自东北购得制火柴梗的椴木；造纸业在西北购得枳机草、胡麻杆），合理分配，使大小厂子都得到原料供给。免除了中间剥削，降低了生产成本。（二）发动与协助纸烟业、造纸业、颜料业等订立劳资集体合同，使生产得到正常发展。（三）反映各行业对税收、电力、运输等的意见，政府正根据这些意见和有关部门商讨处理。（四）协助政府推行工作。如举行工农会时，向数千厂户广泛征集展览品，丰富了展览会的内容；号召本业救灾，各厂户均踊跃捐输。
    　　　　四点经验
    经验证明，新公会时，必须从一点到全面，要有步骤有重点的集中使用力量，先把主要行业（如机器、染织、棉纺、造纸、五金冶制等）公会建立成功（因为这些行业对于城乡互助、内外交流等经济建设方面有密切联系），然后再逐步普及到次要行业，这样稳步前进，才不致使新公会流于形式。其次，建立公会必须贯彻民主精神。过去的旧公会在理监事把持下是极不民主的。这次在人民政府指导下，积极认真的发动各行业提出对于新公会的要求，选举自己相信的人出来办事，，并在会章内明文规定会员有向委员会提出批评建议之权等，深得各行业的拥护。如弹轧花业以往开会时，到会人数仅有百分之六十左右，这次参加投票者达百分之九十五以上；化学染料、机器、染整等行业，则到会百分之百。第三，新公会建立起来后，必须大力加强教育工作，改造某些委员残存的旧思想和作风，建立为人民服务的精神。第四，国营企业应该积极参加新公会，本着公私兼顾的精神协助私营企业发展，发挥国营企业的领导作用，进一步密切公私关系。如天津国营纸桨公司参加造纸业公会，协助造纸业组织考察团到西北收购枳机草、胡麻杆，解决造纸业原料困难，使许多私营企业明确认识国营企业是积极帮助私营企业的发展。
