Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 2nd: Yixi Chuchen recently arrived in Xining, demanding that the People's Liberation Army swiftly liberate Tibet. Yixi Chuchen is the Chökyi Kembo (title, equivalent to Secretary-General) of the late Living Buddha Reting of Tibet. He had been living in Xikang and Qinghai since the Reting incident in Tibet in 1946. When interviewed by reporters, Yixi Chuchen not only praised the excellent military discipline and harmonious military-civilian relations of the People's Liberation Army but also denounced the crimes of the British imperialists in invading China's territory of Tibet. Recalling the true story of British imperialists manipulating the Tibetan political situation and directing the Reting incident, he said: "Under the instigation of the British imperialists, pro-British elements in Tibet surrounded Reting Monastery in February 1946 and captured the Living Buddha Reting alive. The monks of Sera Monastery rose up in resistance. The British imperialists then instigated the Tibetan army to bombard the monastery, massacring the monks. Reting Buddha was then forced to commit suicide by poison." He then described his vagrant life in the Kangqing area for the past three years, saying: "The Kuomintang reactionaries not only had no sympathy for the situation in Tibet but also prevaricated in every way regarding the Tibetan people's demand to get rid of the shackles of the imperialists." He hopes that the People's Liberation Army will quickly liberate Tibet, saying: "Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and by closely uniting with all ethnic groups in the country, can the Tibetan people get rid of imperialist bondage and gain true freedom and happiness.
