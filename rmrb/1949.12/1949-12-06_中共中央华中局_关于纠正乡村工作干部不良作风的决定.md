Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 5th: The decision of the CCP Central China Bureau on rectifying the work style of cadres and correcting the mistakes of indiscriminate beatings and killings in rural work.

(I) In the past six months, the vast number of rural work cadres in the Central China Liberated Area, under the influence of military victories and with the effective assistance of commanders and fighters of the troops, have carried out extremely arduous struggles and are smoothly completing the tasks of suppressing bandits and eliminating local bullies, supporting the front, and collecting grain, and are moving towards the movement of clearing bandits and eliminating local bullies, reducing rent and interest. At present, tens of millions of people are taking action and organizing themselves, and they urgently need all excellent cadres, both Party members and non-Party members, to firmly and correctly lead them in a larger-scale and more organized struggle to effectively unite themselves, defeat the enemy, and achieve further victories. However, in the process of advancing in victory, many places have experienced anarchic and undisciplined errors, particularly the serious phenomenon of beating and scolding people and individual killings. Many cadres not only do not oppose this spontaneous action of the masses, but also adopt a tailist attitude, and even personally beat people, suggest beating people, and organize beating people. No matter what the motive or excuse for this phenomenon, it is an absolutely impermissible and major principled error. If it is allowed to develop freely, it will seriously separate us from the masses and hinder the development of the mass movement; and it will be difficult to complete the task of organizing the broad masses and realizing social reform.

(II) In view of the fact that bandits and local bullies have committed many evils in the rural struggle to suppress bandits and oppose local bullies, and the masses are indignant, and the ideological composition of our cadres is quite impure, it is very easy to make the mistake of indiscriminate beatings and killings. At this important juncture, leading organs at all levels must take necessary measures to strictly check this erroneous work style, mobilize the broad masses of cadres to consciously and immediately correct and stop it. Those individuals who persist in their errors and refuse to repent should be given disciplinary sanctions. Those who use the means of muddying the waters to undermine the connection between our Party and the masses and to sabotage the mass movement, and who have committed serious crimes, should be sent to the people's court for legal punishment.

(III) In the mass movement, when the masses hold meetings to struggle against bandits, local bullies and other saboteurs, it is necessary to promote a full and reasoned struggle method and not allow beating or the use of torture. Certain stubborn and unrepentant bandits, local bullies and other criminals must be sent to the people's court for trial and disposal, and should not be dealt with on the spot. It is necessary to educate the masses to learn to use the tool of the people's democratic dictatorship—the people's court—to suppress counter-revolutionary activities and express the just demands of the masses. The people's court should allow and mobilize the masses to make accusations, indictments and refutations, and should also allow the defendant to defend himself or others to defend him, in order to educate the broad masses, distinguish between right and wrong and the seriousness of the matter, and deal with it appropriately. In the future, we must pay special attention to educating the masses and cadres to respect their own people's government and abide by the laws of their own government, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and defeat the enemy.

(IV) For criminals who must be executed, the charges must be announced, and secret executions are not allowed. Those who have committed serious crimes that cannot be tolerated by the law and must be sentenced to death should be subjected to thorough and realistic investigation by the people's court, obtain strong evidence, obtain the understanding and sympathy of the broad masses, complete the trial and judgment in accordance with legal procedures, and report to the specific higher-level government for approval in accordance with the regulations of the Central Plains People's Government before being executed locally. The reason for this is that excessive killing and indiscriminate killing are extremely detrimental to the cause of the people's revolution, and killing one person wrongly will separate us from the masses and lose social sympathy. Only echoing the demands of some of the masses, without regard to the different opinions of the broad masses, or only relying on the momentary anger of the masses, without organizing the masses to carry out accusations and discussions against local bullies, and obtaining the consent of the vast majority of the masses, and then rushing to kill people to vent their anger, is bound to cause dissatisfaction or regret among the masses, and even the danger of causing division within the masses. We must be strictly vigilant against this.

(V) To implement the correction of the error of indiscriminate beating and killing, it is necessary to earnestly convene county representatives' conferences and district and township peasant representatives' conferences, and turn all the decisions made by the Party into suggestions, submit them to the representatives' conferences for discussion and approval, and transmit them to the lower levels in an organized manner, so that the Party's policies become the policies of the masses, and implement them under the supervision and support of the broad masses. All cadres, both Party members and non-Party members, should conscientiously implement the decisions of the representatives' conferences and correct the past habit of deciding issues only within the cadre meetings of the Party and only promoting and implementing them through a few cadres. All errors that occur among the masses should be corrected through the masses' own organizations and meetings, by the majority of the masses, and all mass work cadres should accept the supervision of the masses and be criticized or approved and supported by the masses, so as to unify responsibility to the higher levels, responsibility to the Party, and responsibility to the masses. All mass work cadres who meet the requirements should join mass organizations such as farmers' associations and trade unions in accordance with certain procedures, and enjoy the rights and obligations of a member in the same way, and carry out activities in a completely equal position and with a democratic style. There must be no privileges to force the majority of the masses to obey themselves. At the same time, we must pay attention to adhering to the policies of the Party and the government, patiently carry out persuasion and education on the erroneous tendencies among the masses, raise the level of awareness of the masses, and correct them; and we cannot adopt a tailist attitude of "whatever the masses want, let them do."

(VI) We should use this autumn and winter to convene meetings to rectify the work style of cadres in a planned way. Using various methods such as Party rectification meetings, work meetings, and training classes, we should check and discuss the errors of beating people, scolding people, indiscriminate killing, and lack of discipline and anarchism, mobilize the broad masses of cadres to overcome this error, strictly criticize and correct all commandism, bureaucratism, and tailism, and study and commend democratic methods and styles in actual work. For the erroneous views and statements circulating among cadres, such as "As long as we beat the enemy, not our own people, it is not an error!" "Beating and killing people is the demand of the masses!" "To let go, we must beat and scold people!" and other excuses, we should use the method of practical comparison and theoretical explanation to distinguish between advantages and disadvantages and to liquidate them. Only by drawing a clear line between right and wrong in terms of ideology, policy regulations, and working methods can the above regulations be understood and conscientiously implemented by cadres, can the erroneous bureaucratic and tailist styles such as beating and scolding people be truly and effectively overcome; and can the broad masses of cadres be better mobilized to strengthen their ties with the masses and lead the increasingly large-scale mass movement.

(VII) For individual cadres who must be given disciplinary sanctions, we should first go through patient persuasion and education to promote their conscious transformation, and we must make all cadres understand the necessity of carrying out disciplinary sanctions, so as to raise the level of awareness of the broad masses of cadres.

(VIII) In areas where the work style of cadres and the degree of impurity of class composition are relatively serious, it is necessary to first rectify the cadres and then launch the mass movement, rather slowly than hastily. At present, it is only appropriate to delimit areas based on the conditions of cadres and the masses, and start key experiments locally. In view of the fact that the good or bad work style of the old cadres has a decisive impact on the work style of a large number of new cadres, special attention should be paid to rectifying the old cadres first when rectifying the work style of cadres, so that they can assume the glorious task of educating new cadres with their high level of awareness.

(IX) It is necessary to reiterate the decision against anarchism and lack of discipline, to establish a system of requesting instructions and reporting, and to strengthen discipline. On the one hand, the leading organs must, in a timely manner, clearly stipulate a number of policy issues that are extremely prone to causing chaos, such as indiscriminate coercion, beating, killing, and confusion in the mass movement, for example, in the struggle to suppress bandits, civilian guns should not be confiscated, but should be transferred for use when the people's armed forces are established in the future, at present, bandit guns should be confiscated but not civilian guns; in the counter-hegemony liquidation, digging up the bottom of wealth should not be promoted; and the boundaries between local bullies and collaborators with bandits, etc., should be clearly defined in accordance with actual experience and the Party's policy principles, so that the lower levels have something to follow and make fewer mistakes. On the other hand, all working comrades must conscientiously implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting, and no important policy issues beyond the regulations are allowed to be decided first and reported later; for matters designated by the higher authorities for inspection, they must be seriously inspected and reported, and no perfunctory response is allowed; policy issues that experience proves must be corrected must be reported and requested in a timely manner. The whole Party must know that policy is the starting point of our actions. Failure to implement correct policies will inevitably lead to the implementation of an erroneous policy, and erroneous policies will inevitably lead the masses to the road of failure. Empiricism, localism, and the tendency to make independent moves are absolutely impermissible today.

(X) The provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees should all hold special meetings to discuss, inspect, and make decisions on the above decisions, and report them to the higher levels level by level. Experiences in implementation should also be reported at any time.

　　中共中央华中局
  　关于纠正乡村工作干部不良作风的决定
    【新华社汉口五日电】中人中央华中局关于整顿干部作风，纠正乡村工作中乱打乱杀错误的决定。
    （一）半年来，华中解放区广大的乡村工作干部，在军事胜利影响与部队指战员有效的帮助下，进行了极其艰苦的斗争，正在顺利地完成剿匪反霸、支前征粮的任务，走向清匪反霸、减租减息运动。现时千万群众正在行动起来，组织起来，正需要党与非党的一切优秀干部坚定地正确地领导他们，进行一个更大规模的更有组织的斗争，有效地团结自己，战胜敌人，取得进一步的胜利。但在胜利前进中，许多地方却发生了无政府无纪律的错误，特别突出的是打人骂人和个别杀人的严重现象。有不少干部不但不反对群众这种自发的行动，反而采取了尾巴主义态度，而且更有自己动手打人、示意打人和组织打人的情形。这种现象不论其动机如何，根据与借口如何，均是一种绝不能允许的和重大原则性的错误。如任其自由发展下去，将会严重地脱离群众，妨害群众运动的发展；而难以完成组织广大群众、实现社会改革的任务。
    （二）鉴于在乡村剿匪反恶霸斗争中，土匪恶霸作恶多端，群情愤激，而我干部思想成份不纯状态又相当严重，极易发生乱打乱杀的错误。在这一重要关键上，各级领导机关必须采取必要的办法，严格检查这种错误作风，动员广大干部起来自觉地即时加以纠正和制止。对于个别坚持错误不知改悔的分子，应给以纪律处分。对采取混水摸鱼的手段借以破坏我党与群众的联系，破坏群众运动，犯有严重罪恶的分子，应送请人民法庭给以法律处分。
    （三）在群众运动中，群众开会斗争土匪恶霸及其他破坏分子时，必须提倡充分地讲理斗争方式而不应允许打人与施用肉刑。对于某些顽抗不悟的土匪恶霸及其他犯罪分子必须送交人民法庭审判处理，而不应当自行当场处理。要教育群众学会运用人民民主专政的工具——人民法庭，去镇压反革命活动，抒伸群众的正义要求。人民法庭既应允许与动员群众进行检举、控告和驳斥，亦应允许被告人自行辩解或他人代行辩解，以便教育广大群众，辩明是非轻重，恰当地处理。今后还须特别注意教育群众及干部尊重自己的人民政府，遵守自己政府的法律，以巩固人民民主专政，战胜敌人。
    （四）对于必须处决的罪犯，必须公布罪状，而不许秘密处死。对罪恶严重法不容宽必须判处死刑者，应经人民法庭进行周密地实事求是地调查，获得有力证据，取得广大群众的了解与同情，依照法律程序，完成审讯与判决，并按中原人民政府规定，呈报特定的上级政府批准，然后在当地执行处理。所以如此，是因为过多杀人和乱杀人，对人民革命事业是极其不利的，错杀一人都会脱离群众，丧失社会同情。只附和部分群众要求，而不顾广大群众的不同意见，或只凭群众的一时激愤，而不组织群众进行反恶霸的控诉和讨论，获得绝大多数群众的同意，即急于杀人泄愤，势必引起群众不满或过后反悔，甚至有引起群众内部分裂的危险。对此，必须严加警戒。
    （五）贯彻纠正乱打乱杀的错误必须认真召开县各界代表会议与区乡农民代表会议，将党所制定的一切决定作成建议，交付代表会议讨论通过，有组织地向下传达，使党的方针变为群众的方针，并在广大群众的监督与支持下使之实现。一切党与非党的干部均应认真实行代表会议的决定，纠正过去只在党内的干部会内来决定问题及只经过少数干部推动执行的习惯。凡是群众中所发生的错误，皆应经过群众自己的组织与会议，由群众多数决定纠正，而所有群众工作干部均应接受群众的监督，由群众分别批评或赞同拥护，这样才能把对上级负责，对党负责与对群众负责统一起来。群众工作干部凡符合条件者，均应依一定手续加入农会、工会等群众团体，同样享受一个会员的权利与义务，以完全平等的地位，用民主的作风，去进行活动。绝不能有任何特权，去强制多数群众服从自己。与此同时，必须注意坚持党与政府的政策，对群众中的错误倾向，应耐心地进行说服教育，提高群众的觉悟程度，加以纠正；而不能采取“群众要怎样，就让他怎样”的尾巴主义态度。
    （六）应利用今年秋冬有计划地召开整顿干部作风的会议。分别使用整党会议、工作会议和训练班等方式，将打人骂人乱杀人和无纪律无政府的错误加以检查讨论，发动广大干部起来克服这一错误，严格批评与纠正一切命令主义、官僚主义和尾巴主义的作风，研究与表扬实际工作中的民主方法与作风。对于流行于干部中的错误看法与说法，如“只要打敌人，不打自己人，就不算错误！”“打人杀人是群众要求！”“要放手，就必须打人骂人！”等借口，应用实际对比与理论说明的方法，分清利害好坏，加以清算，只有从思想上、政策规定上和工作方式上划清是非界线，才能使上述各项规定为干部所了解并认真实施，才能真正有效地克服打人骂人等错误的官僚主义、尾巴主义作风；才能更好地动员起广大干部加强与群众的联系，领导规模日益广大的群众运动。
    （七）对于必须给予纪律处分的个别干部，也应先经过耐心的说服教育，促其自觉转变，并要使所有干部都了解进行纪律处分的很必要性，借以提高广大干部的觉悟水平。
    （八）凡干部作风及阶级成份不纯程度比较严重的地区，皆须先整顿干部，再发起群众运动，宁缓勿急。目前只宜依据干部与群众条件，划定地区，局部地开始重点式试验。鉴于老干部作风的好坏，对于大批新干部的作风有决定的影响作用，因而在整顿干部作风时，应特别注意首先整顿老干部，使他们能以自己的高度觉悟，担负起教育新干部的光荣任务来。
    （九）必须重申反对无纪律无政府状态，建立请示报告制度，加强纪律性的决定。一方面，领导机关必须对群众运动中极易引起乱逼乱打乱杀混乱状态的若干政策问题，例如在剿匪斗争中民枪不应收缴，须待以后建立人民武装时转用，现时应收匪枪不收民枪；在反霸清算中，挖底财不应提倡；以及对恶霸分子、通匪分子的界限等，皆应根据实际经验与党的政策原则及时加以明确规定，以资下级有所遵循，少犯错误。另一方面，所有工作同志必须认真执行请示报告制度，一切超越规定以外的重要政策问题，皆不许先斩后奏；对上级指定检查之事，必须认真检查报告，不许敷衍应付；上级自己指示错了的，必须进行自我检讨。对经验证明必须改正的政策问题，必须及时报告请示。全党须知政策是我们行动的出发点，不执行正确的政策，就必然执行一种错误的政策，而错误的政策又必然会引导群众走向失败的道路。经验主义、地方主义和闹独立性的倾向，在今天是绝对不能允许的。
    （十）对以上决定，各省委、地委和县委皆应召开专门会议，加以讨论检查，做出决定，逐级向上报告。执行中的经验也应随时报来。
