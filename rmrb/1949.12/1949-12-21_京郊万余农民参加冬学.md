　　Over Ten Thousand Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Participate in Winter Studies
    [Beijing News] Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, who are undergoing land reform, are actively participating in winter studies. Due to the growing enthusiasm of farmers to study politics and culture, the number of winter study classes in the suburbs of Beijing increased from 219 to 351 in the first half of this month; in all 286 administrative units under the jurisdiction of the suburban area, including streets, towns, and administrative villages, there is now an average of one winter study class per unit. The number of participants has increased from 9,996 to 13,551. Suburban women, who previously had no opportunity to attend school, are now participating in studies in large numbers. Taking the 19th District as an example, there are 1,366 women participating in winter studies, accounting for 48.5 percent of the 2,815 winter study students in the entire district. The main task of the winter studies in the suburbs of Beijing this year is to conduct ideological education among farmers in a planned way in conjunction with the land reform movement; at the same time, efforts will be made to create conditions to gradually develop the short-term winter studies into regular people's schools, in order to adapt to the fact that the cultural level of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing is slightly higher than that of ordinary farmers. The district governments in the suburbs have all made plans for the development of winter studies, and some districts have also organized district and village winter study committees to lead this work in a unified manner.

　　京郊万余农民参加冬学
    【北京讯】正在进行土地改革的京郊农民，开始积极参加冬学。由于农民要求学习政治与文化的情绪日渐高涨，本月上半月京郊冬学由二百一十九班增至三百五十一班；在全郊区所辖街、镇、行政村等二百八十六个行政单位中，平均每一单位已有冬学一班。参加学习的人数已由九千九百九十六人增至一万三千五百五十一人。一向没有机会入学的郊区妇女现已纷纷参加学习，以十九区为例：参加冬学的妇女已有一千三百六十六人，占全区冬学学员二千八百一十五人的百分之四十八点五。今年京郊冬学的主要任务为结合土地改革运动，在农民中有计划地进行思想教育；同时努力创造条件使短期的冬学逐步发展为经常的民众学校，以适应京郊农民较一般农民的文化水平稍高的特点。郊区各区区政府都已作出发展冬学的计划，有些区并已组织区、村冬学委员会，统一领导此项工作。
