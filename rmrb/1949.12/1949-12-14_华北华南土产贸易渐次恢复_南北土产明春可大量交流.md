Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th. With the successive liberation of Fujian and Guangdong, the trade of native produce between North China and South China has gradually recovered. Soon after the liberation of Fuzhou, Min (Fujian) tea was transshipped to Tianjin. After the liberation of Guangzhou, sugar also began to be transported north, and the price of sugar in Tianjin has fallen. Many merchants from Fujian and Guangdong who had closed their businesses and returned to the South before liberation are now returning to the North one after another to resume their old businesses. Fujian and Guangdong native produce merchants also plan to transport sugarcane, star anise, and other goods to the North for trial sales. Sugarcane has been absent from North China for a long time, and Tianjin's dried and fresh fruit industry also plans to go south to purchase and transport it. Because star anise is produced in Guangxi, and the water transport on the Xijiang River has not yet fully recovered, it cannot be transported to the North in large quantities in the short term.

In the past, North China's native products sold to South China included: red dates, melon seeds, almonds, vermicelli, bai gan (liquor), winter vegetables, peanut oil, soybean oil, and other goods. Small batches will also be transported to the South for trial sales before the end of the year. The North China Native Produce Company is currently working on planning a large-scale exchange of native products between the North and the South. Because the two regions have been isolated for a long time, the market situation requires a longer period of investigation. The large-scale exchange of native products between the North and the South is expected to begin next spring.

　　华北华南土产贸易渐次恢复
  　南北土产明春可大量交流
    【新华社天津十三电】福建、两广次第解放，华北和华南间土产贸易已渐次恢复。福州解放后不久，即有闽茶转口来津。广州解放后，糖货也开始北运，津市糖货已经下跌。天津闽粤商帮解放前多已停业回南，现又纷纷北来，规复旧业。闽粤土产商并拟运甘蔗、大料等货北来试销。甘蔗在华北绝迹已久，津市干鲜果业也拟南去购运。大料因产地在广西，目前西江水运尚未完全恢复，短期内尚不能大量北来。 过去华北土产行销华南的计有： 红枣、瓜子、杏仁、粉条、白干（酒）、冬菜、花生油、豆油等货，年底前亦将有小批南运试销。华北土产公司现正着手规划南北土产的大规模交流。因两地隔绝较久，市场情况需较长时期的调查，南北土产的大量交流，预计明春才能展开。
