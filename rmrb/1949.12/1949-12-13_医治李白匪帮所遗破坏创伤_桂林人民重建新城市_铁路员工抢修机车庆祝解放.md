Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, December 12th – Under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, the working class and the broad masses of the people of Guilin are healing the wounds caused by the heinous destruction perpetrated by the Li Bai bandit gang before their escape, and rebuilding their city. On the eve of Guilin's liberation, workers at the city's telecommunications bureau, in order to protect state assets, scraped together their last remaining hard-earned wages, 80 silver dollars and 2,000 yuan in puppet currency, to satisfy the extortionate greed of the White bandits. But the cruel enemy still carried out explosions. Workers disregarded their own lives and rescued some machinery and materials from the smoke. After liberation, they immediately renovated the facilities, and quickly restored communications with Guangzhou and Hengyang. The damaged automatic telephone exchange has also been repaired and is back in operation. The electric light plant has also been restored. The electric lights, which frequently went out during the White bandit rule, now illuminate this newly born city all night long. The Guilin North and South stations of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway were severely damaged by the bandit gang. Nine locomotives and more than one hundred freight cars were blasted into scrap metal. After liberation, railway workers immediately organized themselves and set out to investigate the bridges destroyed by the bandit gang. Workers at the machinery plant are working overtime to rush repair on Locomotive No. 1 to celebrate their liberation.

The Renminbi (People's Currency) is warmly welcomed by the people of Guilin and is circulating in the market with the highest credit. The day after liberation, fresh vegetables and pork appeared in large quantities in the market. Business and industrial circles organized a Business and Industrial Liberation Federation, responsible for urging shops and factories to resume operations and for preparing grain and other work. On the third day after liberation, commercial vehicles traveling to and from Huixian, Liangjiang, Liangfeng, Hengyang, and other places were already running smoothly.

When the White bandits fled Guilin in a panic at 2:00 PM on November 22nd, the People's Liberation Army entered the city with a majestic stride. The people of Guilin, peering through their tightly closed doors, saw their own troops coming, and immediately firecrackers exploded and the streets were lined with excited crowds. The PLA soldiers could only pass in single file. On the 23rd, the people of Guilin planted the Five-Star Red Flag on the lighthouse in the crossroads square for the first time. Students from Guangxi University rushed from the General's Bridge, ten miles away, to join the welcoming procession. Waves of students from the entire city surged through the streets in parades, singing and shouting slogans. The People's Organizations United Federation organized seventy propaganda teams to give speeches everywhere. The people of the whole city celebrated the festival of liberation with unprecedented joy.

  　桂林人民重建新城市
    铁路员工抢修机车庆祝解放
    【新华社桂林十二日电】桂林市的工人阶级和广大人民群众在军管会的领导下，正在医治李白匪帮逃跑前的罪恶破坏所造成的创伤，重建自己的城市。桂林解放前夕，该市电信局工人为了保护国家资材，曾凑合了自己仅存的血汗工资银洋八十元及伪银元券两千元送给匪军以应付白菲军的勒索贪欲，但残忍的敌人仍施行了爆炸。工人们不顾生命危险，在硝烟中救出了一部分机器和材料，并于解放后立刻装修，很快地就和广州、衡阳恢复通报。被炸坏的自动电话也已经修复通话。电灯厂亦已恢复，白匪统治时经常停电的电灯现已澈夜照耀着这新生的城市。湘桂黔铁路桂林南北站均被匪帮严重破坏，九个机车一百多辆车皮都被炸成废铁。解放后，铁路员工马上组织起来，出发调查被匪帮破坏的桥梁，机械厂工人正在赶工抢修第一号机车，来庆祝自己的解放。
    人民币受到桂林市人民热烈的欢迎，以最高信用在市面流通。解放后第二天，新鲜蔬菜和猪牛肉就大量出现在菜市上。工商界组织了工商解放联合会，负责督促商店工厂复业及筹粮等工作。解放后的第三天，来往会仙、两江、良丰、衡阳等地的商车已经畅通。
    在白匪十一月二十二日午后二时狼狈逃出桂林，人民解放军以雄壮步伐进入市区时，桂林人民从紧闭的门缝中窥见自己的队伍来了，顿时鞭炮齐鸣，大街两旁挤满兴奋的人群。解放军战士只能单行通过。二十三日，桂林人民第一次把五星红旗插在十字路口广场的灯塔上。广西大学的学生从十里外的将军桥赶来参加欢迎行列。全桂市学生们一队队地涌在大街上游行、欢唱和高呼口号。人民团体联合会组织了七十个宣传队到处演讲。全市人民以从没有过的喜悦心情，欢渡解放的节日。
