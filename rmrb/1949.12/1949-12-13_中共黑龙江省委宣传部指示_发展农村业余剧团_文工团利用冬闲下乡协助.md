The CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee Propaganda Department recently issued instructions to rural art and literature work teams to utilize the winter slack season to establish and develop rural amateur theater troupes and to carry out rural art and literature movements. The instructions stated: The Provincial People's Cultural Work Troupe's rural teams should systematically help establish rural amateur theater troupes in various counties and districts to extensively carry out Spring Festival art and literature activities. Each county should select villages and towns with better conditions and establish one or two rural amateur theater troupes in each district this winter. The activities of amateur theater troupes should be closely integrated with production, publicizing the Party's policies in rural areas, and resolving the problems existing in the minds of cadres and the masses; educating farmers, helping farmers develop proper entertainment to replace the bad habit of gambling during the old Spring Festival. All old-style, old-content folk dramas that used to be widely popular in Northeast China, such as donkey shadow plays and Errenzhuan, should be appropriately reformed to serve the construction of New Democracy. Carrying out rural art and literature movements must involve creative activities. Therefore, the instructions emphasize "promoting self-writing, self-directing, and self-acting, and cultivating mass art and literature creation." The creation of old-style, new-content forms such as Yangko, short plays, poems, quick-talks, big drums, and doggerel should be promoted. The provincial committee requires that the propaganda departments in all regions should promote good works; and should help to revise works with shortcomings.
