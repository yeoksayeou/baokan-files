　　Strive to be a Model in Production with the Fighting Spirit of the Past
    Soldiers of the North China Military Region Garrison Battalion Respond to the Production Call
    [Beijing News] All commanders and fighters of the North China Military Region Garrison Battalion unanimously support Chairman Mao's "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Production and Construction Work in 1950". After hearing this instruction on the radio or seeing it in the newspaper, the soldiers expressed their enthusiastic support and guaranteed to resolutely implement it. Some companies immediately put out blackboards, and some companies held discussion meetings in various classes. Guo Dingfan, a soldier from the Fourth Company, said at the discussion meeting: We are the people's soldiers, and our food, clothing, and use are all from the people. The people have suffered from the destruction of the Japanese devils and the Chiang bandits, and coupled with the famine, they are very bitter. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to reduce the burden on the people. Soldier Zhao Huamin said: Now that the remaining enemies are about to be eliminated, we should fight against the difficulties in the road of building a new China, and treat production as a battle, using as much strength as we have. Soldier Zhang Dasheng added: Production cannot forget defending the motherland. We must learn skills and produce at the same time, so that we can produce and fight. The soldiers have a clearer understanding of the arduousness and importance of future construction work, just as soldier Guo Dingfan said: "Chairman Mao's call for us to participate in production and construction is as important as liberating the whole of China. We must govern the country after we have conquered it; only by doing a good job in production and construction can the country become stronger day by day." The soldiers are all from working people, and many of them have helped farmers build houses and cultivate land in the countryside in the past. They have full confidence in completing the tasks instructed by Chairman Mao, and everyone guarantees each other: We must continue to strive for models in future production and construction undertakings with the fighting spirit of the past.

　　要以过去的战斗精神争取作生产中的模范
    华北军区警备营战士响应生产号召
    【北京讯】华北军区警备营全体指战员，一致拥护毛主席“关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示”。战士们从广播中听到，或从报纸上看到这个指示后，都表示热烈拥护，并保证坚决执行。有的连马上就出黑板报，有的连各班分别开了座谈会。四连战士郭定范在座谈会上说：咱们是人民的子弟兵，吃穿用都是人民的，人民遭到日本鬼和蒋匪的破坏，又加上灾荒，都是很苦的，咱们一定要响应毛主席这个伟大的号召，来减轻人民的负担。战士赵化民说：现在残余敌人快消灭了，咱们就应该向建设新中国道路上的困难作斗争，把生产当做战斗，有多大力量，使多大力量。战士张达生补充说：生产不能忘了保卫祖国，咱们要一边学本领，一边生产，做到能生产、能战斗。战士们更明确的认识到今后建设工作的艰巨与重要，正如战士郭定范说的：“毛主席号召咱们参加生产建设，跟解放全中国一样重要，打下天下就得治天下；只有搞好生产建设工作，国家才能一天天地强盛起来。”战士们都是劳动人民出身，许多人过去曾在农村帮助农民修建房子和种地，他们对完成毛主席所指示的任务，具有充分的信心，大家并互相保证：要以过去的战斗精神，继续在今后的生产建设事业中争取模范。
