　　Stalin and the Tractor
    In the movie "The Vow," I saw Stalin sitting on the first tractor made in the Soviet Union itself. Although the tractor was old-fashioned and clumsy, stopping and starting intermittently; although the Trotskyites beside him mocked and satirized, saying: "Producing such a bad machine, it would be better to order it from the United States, which is both nimble and convenient." But Stalin excitedly and encouragingly said to the designing engineer: "Although the machine is bad, at least we have something!" In his mind, he also envisioned the future production of thousands of tractors rolling off the production line in large quantities, plowing back and forth on that vast land. Now Stalin's great ideal has long become a reality.
    This is a good education for people who lack self-confidence and are confused by the technology of capitalism—especially American imperialism.

　　斯大林与拖拉机
    在“宣誓”那张电影里，我看到斯大林坐在苏联自己制造的第一辆拖拉机上，虽然拖拉机是又老式又笨拙，时走时停；虽然托洛茨基派的人在旁嘲笑，讽刺地说：“生产这种好机器，不如到美国去订购，又灵巧又便利。”但是斯大林却兴奋地、鼓励地对设计的工程师说：“机器虽差，但总算有了！”他的脑海里一面又呈现着未来制好的千万拖拉机底大批出厂，在那辽阔的地土上来往耕种。如今斯大林这个伟大的理想，早成事实。
    这对于缺乏自信心，迷惑于资本主义——尤其是美帝国主义底技术的人们，是一个很好的教育。
