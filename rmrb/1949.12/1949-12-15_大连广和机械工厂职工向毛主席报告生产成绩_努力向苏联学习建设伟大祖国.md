Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th:

　　The 710 workers of Dalian Guanghe Machinery Factory, to celebrate the birth of New China and this year's October Revolution Day, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on November 3rd to report their production achievements this year and put forward three points of guaranteed implementation. The letter was written on a piece of red silk, which said: Respected Chairman Mao:
　　The birth of New China and the arrival of the October Revolution Day are inspiring our production enthusiasm. All our employees decided to carry out a movement to create new production records, and use practical actions to break through all original production quotas to celebrate the birth of our great motherland and the great October Revolution Day. We report our production achievements this year to you with great excitement and propose three reservations:
　　Our factory is a newly built machinery factory. Since we started normal production in April this year, the production rate has gradually increased. Up to now, we have completed 82% of this year's task; the product quality has reached the accuracy of the world-class secondary products. This has not only increased production and improved quality, but also gradually improved our lives under the implementation of the "piece-rate wage" system. The reason why we have been able to achieve these results is due to your and the Chinese Communist Party's wise leadership and the liberation, defense, and assistance of the heroic Soviet Red Army. In the future, under your call, we will learn from the Soviet Union, continue to work hard to produce, support the people's liberation war throughout the country, so that it can quickly achieve complete victory, and build our own country, so that our country will be transformed from an agricultural country into an industrial country as soon as possible. To this end, all our 710 employees hereby guarantee to complete the following reservations:
　　(1) Guarantee to complete this year's production task one month ahead of schedule;
　　(2) In 1950, we will manufacture 100 all-gear eight-foot lathes, 150 six-foot single back lathes, and 160 tons of machine parts;
　　(3) Resolutely support the superior's decision to expand our factory's production, and guarantee to complete the three-phase expansion plan of Guanghe before 1953, and build a modern factory capable of manufacturing large, medium, small, and various types of precision machine tools. At that time, we will have 2,500 to 3,000 workers participating in production, and the annual output will reach about 2,000 units. We are willing to faithfully shoulder a task of building our great motherland.
　　We wish you good health!
　　We cheer:
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!
　　Long live the leader of the working people of the world, Marshal Stalin!
　　Long live the great October Revolution Day!
　　Salute from all employees of Dalian Guanghe Machinery Factory
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　November 3, 1949

    （一）保证提前一个月完成今年生产任务；
    （二）在一九五○年，我们要制造出一百台全齿轮八英尺镟床，一百五十台六英尺单背镟床和一百六十吨机器零件；
    （三）坚决拥护上级扩大我厂生产的决定，保证在一九五三年以前，完成我广的三期扩大计划，建设起一个现代化的能制造大、中、小、各种类型的精密工作母机的工厂。那时，我们将有二千五百名到三千名工友参加生产，年产量将达二千台上下。我们愿忠诚的来肩负一份建设我们伟大祖国的任务。
    祝您身体健康！
