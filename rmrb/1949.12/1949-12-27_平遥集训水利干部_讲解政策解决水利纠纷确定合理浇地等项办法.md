　　Pingyao Trains Water Conservancy Cadres
　  Explaining Policies, Resolving Water Conservancy Disputes, and Determining Reasonable Irrigation Methods
    [Our Newspaper] In order to improve water conservancy work and ensure the completion of winter irrigation tasks, the Pingyao County People's Government of Shanxi Province convened a short-term training class from the 21st to the 27th of last month, gathering 121 people including water conservancy and production directors from 77 villages along the Liugen and Huiji Rivers in the county. During the training, water conservancy policies were systematically explained, breaking down the narrow, selfish, and departmental thinking existing among water conservancy cadres in various villages, and resolving 13 water disputes between villages. Under the principle of "mutual unity, doing a good job in water conservancy," the villages agreed on an irrigation method of "upper rounds to lower, irrigating in order, cycle after cycle," completely abolishing the old unreasonable system of "luck and chance." At the same time, village cadres decided to organize several water conservancy committees based on the river course, and set up irrigation supervision teams, composed of one person selected from each village, to supervise water distribution, inspect canal works, and lead the masses in rational irrigation. Irrigation covenants were also formulated, stipulating that no ash or slag should be dumped into the river, protecting canals, and that everyone should plant trees during the planting season, etc.
