　　Four Hundred Million People Offer Birthday Greetings
    Qin Zhaoyang
    Countless roads,
    Every one leads to Moscow,
    Every road leads to revolution,
    Every one leads to Stalin.
　
    Countless roads,
    Every road has travelers,
    Everyone walks towards the same place,
    Everyone walks towards Stalin.
　
    Countless roads,
    Every road has travelers,
    Everyone looks towards the same place,
    Everyone looks at Stalin.
　
    Countless roads,
    Every road has sounds,
    Everyone sings one word,
    Everyone sings Stalin.
　
    How many roads are there? Countless!
    How many people are there? Countless!
    How many people, how many hearts,
    Every heart faces Stalin.
　
    He is the heart of the people, an ageless heart!
    He is the lamp of the people, a constantly shining lamp!
    An ageless heart, a constantly shining lamp,
    He is Stalin, in his seventies!
　
    The people celebrate his seventieth birthday,
    He sees the people walking towards him,
    How mighty are the people's ranks,
    There are four hundred million people on the Eastern continent!
　
    Seeing the four hundred million people, he is even happier,
    Among the four hundred million people is a commander-in-chief,
    Commander-in-chief Mao Zedong takes the lead and shouts:
    Long live, Stalin!
　
    All of humanity has heard this voice,
    All of humanity has heard this voice,
    Four hundred million people with one voice:
    Long live, Stalin!

　　四万万人祝寿
    秦兆阳
    条条道路数不清，
    条条通向莫斯科城，
    条条道路通向革命，
    条条通向斯大林。
　
    条条道路数不清，
    条条路上有行人，
    人人都往一处走，
    人人走向斯大林。
　
    条条道路数不清，
    条条路上有行人，
    人人都往一处看，
    人人看着斯大林。
　
    条条道路数不清，
    条条路上有声音，
    人人歌唱一个字，
    人人歌唱斯大林。
　
    有多少条路？数不清！
    有多少个人？数不清！
    多少个人有多少个心，
    心心向着斯大林。
　
    他就是人民的心，不老的心！
    他就是人民的灯，长明的灯！
    不老的心长明的灯，
    他就是七十几的斯大林！
　
    人民庆祝他的七十寿辰，
    他看见了走向他的人民，
    人民的队伍多么壮大，
    东方大陆有四万万多人！
　
    看见了四万万人他更加高兴，
    四万万人里有一个总司令，
    总司令毛泽东带头一声喊：
    万岁呀，斯大林！
　
    全人类都听见了这个声音，
    全人类都听见了这个声音，
    四万万人一个声音：
    万岁呀，斯大林！
