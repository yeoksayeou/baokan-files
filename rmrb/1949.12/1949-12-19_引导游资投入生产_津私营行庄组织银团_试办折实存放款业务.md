　　【Tianjin News】In order to channel idle capital into production and absorb surplus commercial funds to support the development of small and medium-sized industries, private banks and financial institutions in Tianjin have formed syndicates to pilot inflation-adjusted deposit and loan business. Currently, the first syndicate, consisting of 14 institutions including Guohua Bank, issued two inflation-adjusted loans last month, providing 85,000 units to Yaohua Glass Company and 20,000 units to Danhua Match Company. It also accepted over 2,000 units of inflation-adjusted deposits from other financial institutions. The second syndicate, consisting of 12 institutions including Juxingcheng, has already collected 60,000 inflation-adjusted units (5,000 per institution) and has loaned out 33,000 units (to Zhongxing Paper Mill, Kaicheng Chemical Company, Guangming Vegetable Oil Factory, and Bohai Paper Mill). This syndicate plans to issue loans using the collected funds before accepting inflation-adjusted deposits. Furthermore, 90 financial institutions and silver shops in Tianjin have jointly raised 600 million yuan in funds, preparing to handle inflation-adjusted deposit and loan business. They plan to establish a joint office in Zhiyuan Financial Institution, adopting a collective deposit system based on each institution's fund ratio, with the office uniformly responsible to external parties.
