　　Shandong Provincial Department of Finance Learning Committee
  　Advocates Close Reading of Documents
    Correcting the Bad Habits of Swallowing Knowledge Whole and Answering Exam Questions Irrelevantly.
    [Report from this newspaper] Advocating for the close and detailed reading of documents and conscientious study, as well as transforming the perfunctory and superficial learning style, are the requirements emphasized in the recent cadre learning summary of the Shandong Provincial People's Government Department of Finance Learning Committee. During the learning stage from October 15th to November 15th, the Learning Committee adopted two steps to guide: Firstly, at the beginning of the learning, it initiated challenges and responses between groups and individuals, thus making the learning atmosphere in the office intense. More than 240 questions were raised. After the questions were raised, the Learning Committee summarized them separately for everyone to discuss, requested answers from the leaders, published special Q&A issues, assigned specific individuals to answer, and called on everyone to study together. This promoted comrades to diligently study documents and extensively collect materials, and urged individual comrades who were not actively learning.
    Secondly, to summarize the learning, tests were held. Before the test, the Learning Committee distributed the questions to each group for discussion; after the test, a judging committee (further divided into a judging group and a review group) was established to formulate standard answers and conduct scoring. In terms of method, to avoid unevenness and speed up the review, it was determined that each person would specialize in judging one question.
    Through this test, two main deviations were found in the answers: (1) Abstract, empty, and irrelevant, with an unclear understanding of the basic spirit of the questions, and unable to grasp the core and key points. For example, when asked why imperialism wants to undermine Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, some comrades only talked emptily about the vastness and abundance of land and resources of China and the Soviet Union, and their immense power, without explaining the important significance of the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union for world peace and democracy, as well as the essence of imperialists' opposition to peace and democracy. Furthermore, when asked how to learn from the Soviet Union and how to smash the sabotage of imperialism, some comrades said very generally: "We must take Russia as our teacher and participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," "We must always be vigilant about the conspiracies of imperialism and build national defense." These answers were mostly made by comrades with a longer history of struggle, indicating insufficient conscientious study of the documents.
    (2) Simply Piling Up. For example, when answering the question of the Soviet October Revolution's promotion of world and Chinese revolution, many comrades piled up the famous sayings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, incoherently, making it unclear what they were explaining; this shows that these comrades not only have inappropriate wording, but also have vague ideas, and there is a perfunctory and superficial learning style in studying the documents. Therefore, it is proposed to use close and detailed reading and conscientious study of documents to correct these two deviations.

### 山东财政厅学委会　提倡精读文件  纠正读书生吞活剥、答卷子不着边际的毛病。

　　山东财政厅学委会
  　提倡精读文件
    纠正读书生吞活剥、答卷子不着边际的毛病。
    【本报讯】提倡对文件的精读细读，认真钻研；转变粗枝大叶不求甚解的学习作风，是山东省人民政府财政厅学委会最近干部学习总结中强调提出的要求。该厅从十月十五日到十一月十五日这一阶段的学习，学委会曾采取了两个步骤来进行领导，第一步，学习开始时，发动了组与组、个人与个人之间的挑战应战，因而机关学习空气趋于紧张。共提出二百四十多个问题。问题提出后，学委会又分别归纳交大家讨论，请首长解答和出版问答专号，指定专人答复，号召大家研讨。这样，推动了同志们认真钻研文件和广泛收集材料，督促了个别学习不积极的同志。
    第二步，总结学习，举行测验，在测验之前，学委会将题目发给各组讨论；测验后成立评判委员会（下又分评判组与审查组），拟定标准答案，进行评分。在方法上为避免轻重及加快评阅速度，确定每人专评一题。
    通过此次测验，发现了在答卷上存有两个主要偏差：（一）抽象空洞，不着边际，对问题的基本精神认识不清，掌握不住中心和要点。如问帝国主义为什么要破坏中苏友谊合作，有的同志只是空谈中苏两国地大物博，强大无比，而未能说明中苏两国的友谊合作，对世界和平民主的重要意义，以及帝国主义者反对和平民主的本质。再如问及应如何学习苏联及如何粉碎帝国主义的破坏时，某些同志很原则地说：“要以俄为师，参加中苏友协”，“要时刻警惕帝国主义的阴谋，建设国防”。这种答案多为斗争历史较长的同志所作，说明认真钻研文件的不够。
    （二）生堆硬垒。如很多同志在答复苏联十月革命对世界及对中国革命的推动时，把马、恩、列、斯、毛的名言，不相联贯的堆砌在一起，看不清他说明了什么问题；说明这些同志不仅词句欠妥，而且是思想模糊，在研读文件中存在着粗枝大叶、不求甚解的学习作风，因此提出以精读细读，认真钻研文件来纠正这两个偏向。
