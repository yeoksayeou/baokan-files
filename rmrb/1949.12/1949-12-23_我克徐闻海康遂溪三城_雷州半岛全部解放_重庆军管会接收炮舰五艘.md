　　Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 22nd: Belated news: The three cities on the Leizhou Peninsula, Xuwen, Haikang, and Suixi, have all been liberated by the People's Liberation Army's Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column. As early as October 20th, the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column annihilated the pseudo-Xuwen Security Team that attempted to flee to Hainan Island and immediately stationed itself in Xuwen City. In early November, the column also occupied the old city of Suixi, followed by the capture of the new city of Suixi on the 13th, capturing over a hundred officers and soldiers, including the pseudo-county magistrate of Suixi. On the 5th of this month, a unit of the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column besieged Haikang, and the pseudo-county magistrate of the county immediately led his troops to surrender.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 20th: The Chongqing Military Control Commission dispatched personnel on the 14th to take over five shallow-water gunboats, "Minquan," "Changde," "Yongping," "Yingshan," and "Yingde," under the jurisdiction of the Navy River Defense Command of the Kuomintang reactionary government. The "Changde" and "Yongping" ships were received by the Kuomintang reactionary government from the Japanese after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The "Yingshan" and "Yingde" ships were "presented" to the Kuomintang bandit regime by the British government. The "River Defense Command" originally belonged to the Second River Defense Fleet of the Navy Headquarters of the Kuomintang reactionary government, with a total of twenty-one gunboats, operating in the area from Anqing to Chongqing. Apart from the five ships taken over this time, of the other sixteen, some were captured by our army in the Yichang area, and the other part had been sunk by Chiang bandits.

　　我克徐闻海康遂溪三城
    雷州半岛全部解放
    重庆军管会接收炮舰五艘
    【新华社华南前线二十二日电】迟到消息：雷州半岛上之徐闻、海康、遂溪三城，已全部为人民解放军粤桂边纵队所解放。早在十月二十日，粤桂边纵队歼灭了企图逃往海南岛的伪徐闻保安队，并即进驻徐闻城。十一月初，该纵队又占领遂溪旧城，接着于十三日攻克遂溪新城，俘遂溪伪县长以下官兵百余名。本月五日，粤桂边纵队一部围攻海康，该县伪县长当即率部投降。
    【新华社重庆二十日电】重庆军管会于十四日派员接收国民党反动政府海军江防司令部所辖之“民权”、“常德”、“永平”、“英山”、“英德”等五艘浅水炮舰。“常德”、“永平”两舰是抗战胜利后国民党反动政府从日寇手中接收过来的。“英山”、“英德”两舰则为英国政府“赠送”给国民党匪邦的。该“江防司令部”原属国民党反动政府海军总司令部第二江防舰队，共有炮舰二十一艘，活动于安庆至重庆一带。除此次接收之五艘外，其他十六艘中，一部已于宜昌一带被我军缴获，另一部则已被蒋匪炸沉。
