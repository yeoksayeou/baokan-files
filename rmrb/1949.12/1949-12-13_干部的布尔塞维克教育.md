　　The Bolshevik Education of Cadres
　　Sniečkus, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party
　　This article is translated from the "Party Life" column of the Pravda on October 29, 1949. In accordance with the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on December 24, 1926, Pravda established the "Party Life" column to clarify the party's internal work and party-government work as its main tasks. It conducts ideological and political education of communists and develops Bolshevik self-criticism through it, studies and summarizes the experience of party work, and realizes the party's supervision of the activities of economic organs, praising the vanguard role of party members in production. In each issue of the "Party Life" column, there are reports of party activities in various places, and articles are often written by responsible comrades of party organizations at all levels. These articles are very helpful for our Chinese party's cadre education. This newspaper will successively select and translate them for publication. It is hoped that party organizations and responsible comrades in various places can also often write similar papers and communications and send them to this newspaper for publication.

    The socialist construction of Soviet Lithuania is expanding widely year by year. The national economy destroyed by German fascists has been smoothly restored: new factories have been built; collective farms are growing and consolidating; the culture of the Lithuanian people—a culture of socialist content and national form—is rapidly rising.
    The current huge tasks of our republic require party organizations to carry out precise work in the selection, allocation, and training of leading cadres.
    Comrade Stalin said: "In order to realize the correct political line, we need cadres, we need such people: they understand the party's political line, can grasp it like their own line, are prepared to implement it, will realize it in practice, and are able to be responsible for it, defend it, and fight for it."
    The party organizations of the republic, following the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), have paid great attention to the selection, allocation, and education of cadres, and to cultivating their own Soviet intellectuals. In the past three years, more than 9,000 people have been selected from workers, peasants, and working intellectuals to engage in leading work.
    Selecting leading workers from workers, peasants, and intellectuals requires great efforts from party organizations in training. We have always unswervingly adhered to Comrade Stalin's instructions: to create the characteristics of Bolshevik cadres in ethnic regions; "Nationalism is the basic ideological obstacle to selecting Marxists as cadres in various border areas and republics." We educate cadres with the spirit of loyalty to the Lenin-Stalin party, and train them to engage in a resolute struggle with the remnants of class enemies and bourgeois nationalists.
    In the republic, great work has been carried out to educate cadres in Marxism-Leninism. The republic's party schools have graduated two terms of staff from party and Soviet organs. In addition, the network of party night schools attached to the party county committees, city committees, and district committees has doubled, and the number of students has increased fivefold. Political schools have been established in various townships and many large enterprises. Currently, 2,915 people are studying in Marxism-Leninism night universities. 370 propagandists have graduated from three-month training courses. Training courses for cultivating propagandists in rural areas have also been established.
    In terms of cultivating industrial leadership cadres, the states have also done a lot of work: this spring, the first batch of half-year training courses for leaders of republic enterprises graduated. Seminars for industrial leaders are systematically held under the party's municipal committees.
    Due to the development of collective farm construction, the training of agricultural cadres has special significance. The newly established collective farms need skilled leadership. We need to train a large number of collective farm chairmen, team leaders, accountants, livestock workers, agronomists, zoologists, veterinarians, and mechanics. This year alone, the training courses have trained more than 700 collective farm chairmen, agricultural team leaders, and pasture leaders; trained nearly 2,000 tractor drivers, tractor team leaders, mechanics of machine tractor stations, combine operators, and automobile drivers; and there are also 2,500 qualified staff members. However, now that the number of collective farms in the republic is gradually increasing, the scale of this cadre training is no longer sufficient. The republic has provided great possibilities for adopting some methods to strengthen the training of agricultural cadres. Because we have the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Veterinary Medicine, eight agricultural specialized schools, two two-year agricultural schools, and training courses for leading workers.
    The party organizations of the republic attach great importance to consolidating local Soviet organs and cultivating Soviet cadres. The quality of Soviet leading workers has improved year by year, and the proportion of party members has increased. As a result, the role of local Soviets in economic and cultural construction has been enhanced. The Council of Ministers of the republic has attached a half-year training course for Soviet workers.
    In recent years, significant work has also been completed in selecting women cadres. Women account for 13.4 percent of the leading workers in the party, Soviet, Communist Youth League, and trade union organs of the republic. Three years ago, there were only 24 women workers in the township and village Soviets in Kretinga County. Now there are 199. The number of women serving as teachers and doctors has also increased, and more than 200 women are studying in the party's education network.
    The political education of Soviet intellectual cadres is also a central concern of the republic's party organizations. In recent years, hundreds of teachers and scientific workers in Vilnius and Kaunas have graduated from Marxism-Leninism night universities.
    Lithuania is rapidly cultivating new Soviet intellectual cadres. The number of specialists graduating from Vilnius and Kaunas National Universities is increasing year by year, with 700 graduates this year. Teacher training schools and teacher training courses have trained nearly 2,000 teachers.
    The historical resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues and the materials from the conference of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the issue of Michurin agricultural biology help our intellectuals to overcome the remnants of bourgeois ideology and actively participate in creative labor. Our scholars are increasingly closely linking science with practice. For example, the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences held a scientific conference to study the construction of collective farms in Šiauliai County. Collective farm members, local party and Soviet staff, and agricultural specialists participated in the conference along with the scholars. The Academy of Sciences also held a similar conference on livestock issues in a collective farm in Radviliškis County.
    Writers, composers, painters, and other creative workers in the republic have contributed more works on modern themes to help party organizations complete the task of communist education for workers. And some of our creative workers have also won Stalin Prizes. However, educational work among Soviet intellectuals (especially rural intellectuals) is still insufficient. Our task is to comprehensively strengthen and improve its quality.
    The education of cadres is by no means limited to learning through schools, training courses, and seminars; practical work is of decisive significance. Comrade Stalin instructed: "The real training of cadres can only be obtained from living work, from outside the school, from the struggle with difficulties, and from overcoming difficulties."
    Therefore, it is of special significance to enhance the role of party grassroots organizations and strengthen lower-level party cadres. One of our most important tasks is to create party grassroots organizations in various enterprises, state-owned farms, and machine tractor stations, and to expand the party organization network in collective farms, that is, to select outstanding workers, collective farmers, and representatives of advanced intellectuals to join the party. It is necessary to strengthen the enthusiasm of the work of party grassroots organizations, so that they can more fully exercise their rights and functions to improve the economic work of enterprises and institutions, and to mobilize workers and staff to complete production plans. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that party leadership organs rely on party grassroots organizations when implementing all policies.
    The Executive Bureau of the Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee regularly listens to reports from party grassroots organizations and party township committee secretaries. The Central Committee's resolutions on these reports are usually discussed in various party organizations. Recently, it listened to the reports of the party secretary of the "Pirmūnas" collective farm in Alytus County and the secretary of the Viekšniai Township Committee in Mažeikiai County. The report of the party secretary of the Vilnius tannery was also educational.
    The party county committees have become more attentive to the cause of cadre education. The Jonava County Committee is an example. Jonava County was organized two years ago. The leaders are young cadres. The party county committee correctly determined that the success of the cause depends on the combat effectiveness of the party's grassroots organizations and township committees. The county committee's workers often go to the townships to deeply understand the activities of the party's grassroots organizations and provide them with practical help on the spot. The positive experience of individual party organizations has become the property of all communists in the county. All this has promoted the county to successfully complete the task of collective farm construction.
    Cadres grow and are tempered in Bolshevik strictness and resolute struggle with shortcomings. The responsibility of the party's leading organs is to constantly strive to do a good job in cadre work, so that they can dedicate their greatest efforts to their responsibilities. Checking the implementation of the party's resolutions and instructions is the most effective way to educate party organizations and every communist. The Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party strengthened its supervision of the implementation of the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and its own resolutions, and recently conducted inspections of the operations of the Trakai, Ukmergė, Tauragė, and other party organizations. During the inspection process, some major shortcomings in the working methods of certain county committees, the organization of party and political propaganda, and the selection and education of cadres were exposed.
    The methods adopted by the Central Committee have definitely improved the operations of these party organizations.
    The Sixth Congress of Lithuanian Bolsheviks made a pledge to Comrade Stalin: In the most recent years, the collective farm system must achieve complete victory in the republic; strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; enable the culture of the Lithuanian people to achieve further prosperity; improve the ideological and organizational work of party organizations; raise revolutionary vigilance; and resolutely fight against the smallest manifestations of bourgeois nationalism. The party organizations of the republic will do everything possible to ensure that these guarantees are gloriously fulfilled.

    苏维埃立陶宛的社会主义建设，逐年广泛地展开着。被德国法西斯摧毁了的国民经济，顺利地恢复起来：新工厂建设起来；集体农场增长巩固着；立宛陶人民的文化——社会主义内容民族形式的文化，快速地上升着。
    我们共和国当前的巨大任务，要求党组织在选拔、配置与培养领导工作干部上，进行精密的工作。
    斯大林同志说：“为要实现正确的政治方针，需要干部，需要这样的人：他们了解党的政治方针，能象自己的方针一样掌握着它，准备着实行它，会在实际中实现它，能够对它负责、保卫它、为它而奋斗。
    共和国的党组织，遵从联共（布）中央委员会的指示，对于干部的选拔、配置与教育；对于培养自己的苏维埃知识分子，都给与了极大的注意。近三年来，从工人、农民和劳动知识分子中，选拔出了九千多人从事领导工作。
    由工人、农民及知识分子中选拔领导工作者，需要党组织在培养工作方面的巨大努力。我们始终不渝地遵守着斯大林同志的指示：在民族区域内创造布尔塞维克干部的特质；“民族主义——是各边区及共和国中选拔马克思主义者的干部的基本思想障碍。”我们以对列宁——斯大林党的忠诚精神教育干部，锻炼他们从事与阶级的敌对分子残余及资产阶级民族主义者们做坚决的斗争。
    共和国中，进行了以马列主义教育干部的巨大工作。共和国的党校，已毕业了两期党和苏维埃机关的工作人员。此外，党的县委会、市委会与区委会所附设的党的夜校网，扩大了两倍，而学员的数目增加到五倍。各乡和许多大企业中都设有政治学校。现在，有二千九百十五人在马列主义夜大学中学习。有三百七十名宣传员在三个月的讲习所里结业了。农村中培养宣传员的讲习所，也已设立起来。
    在培养工业的领导干部方面，各州也做了许多工作：今年春天，共和国企业领导人员的半年讲习所第一批毕了业。在党的市委会下有系统地举行着工业领导工作者的讨论会。
    由于集体农场建设的发展，农业干部的培养就有了特殊的意义。新生的集体农场需要熟练的领导。我们需要大规模的培养集体农场主席、小组长、会计、牲畜工作者、农业家、动物学家、兽医和机械师干部。只在今年，讲习所就培养了七百多个集体农场主席、农业小组长和牧场的领导者；训练了近二千名拖拉机手、拖拉机队长、机器拖拉机站的机械手，康拜因驾驶手和汽车司机；还有二千五百名有资格的工作人员。然而，现在当共和国内集体农场逐渐增加的时候，这种培养干部的规模，已经是不够了。共和国对于采取一些加强培养农业干部的方法上，提供了很大的可能性。因为我们有农业科学院、兽医科学院、八所农业专门学校、两所二年制的农业学校和领导工作者的讲习所。
    共和国的党组织，对巩固地方苏维埃机关及培养苏维埃干部的事业，具有重大的意义。苏维埃领导工作者的质量逐年改善着，党的成分增加起来。因之提高了地方苏维埃在经济及文化建设中的作用。在共和国部长会议下，附设有苏维埃工作者的半年为期的讲习所。
    近年来在选拔妇女干部方面也完成了重大的工作。共和国的党、苏维埃、共青团和职工会机关中的领导工作者，妇女占百分之十三点四。在克列金县的乡和村苏维埃中三年以前总共只有二十四个妇女工作员，现在已是一百九十九名了，担任教师和医生的妇女数目也增多起来，同时有二百多个妇女在党的教育网中学习着。
    苏维埃知识分子干部的政治教育，也是共和国党组织所关切的中心问题。近数年来，在维利纽斯和加乌纳斯城中，有数百名教师和科学工作者，都在马列主义夜大学中毕了业。
    立陶宛以很快的速度培养出了新的苏维埃知识分子干部。维利纽斯和加乌纳斯国立大学毕业的专门家，逐年增加着，今年就有七百名毕业生。师范学校和教师讲习所培养出将近二千名教师。
    联共（布）中央委员会对思想问题的历史性的决议，全苏列宁农业科学院对米邱林农业生物学问题会议的资料，帮助我们的知识分子来克服资产阶级思想的残渣而积极地参加创造的劳动。我们的学者使科学与实践愈来愈紧密地联系起来了。例如，立陶宛的科学院曾举行了科学代表会议以研究沙乌梁斯基县的集体农场建设。在这个代表会上，和学者们一齐参加会议的，还有集体农场庄员、地方党及苏维埃中的工作人员和农业专们家。科学院在拉得维利什县的一个集体农场中，也曾举办了类似的牧畜问题的代表会议。
    共和国内的作家、作曲家、画家和其他创作工作者们，贡献了更多的现代题材的作品，以帮助党组织完成对劳动者共产主义教育的任务。并且我们有一些创作工作者还获得了斯大林奖金。然而在苏维埃知识分子（尤其是农村知识分子）中的教育工作，仍然是不够的。我们的任务是全面地加强并提高其质量。
    干部的教育，全然不只局限于学校、讲习所和讨论会等学习手段，具有决定意义的是实际工作。斯大林同志指示说：“干部的真正锻炼，要从活生生的工作中，从学校外边，从和困难斗争中，从克服困难中才能获得。”
    因之，提高党的基层组织的作用，加强党的下级干部就有了特殊的意义。我们最重要的一个任务，即是在各企业、各国营农场和机器拖拉机站中创设党的基层组织，在集体农场中扩大党组织网，即是要选拔优秀的工人、集体农民及先进的知识分子代表来加入党。必需加强党的基层组织工作的积极性，使它们更充分地运用自己的权利及职能，以改善企业及机关的经济工作，以动员工人及职员来完成生产计划。另一方面，必需使党的领导机关在贯彻一切方针时，一定要依靠党的基层组织。
    立陶宛共产党中央执行局经常听取党的基层组织和党的乡委会书记的报告。中央委员会对这些报告的决议，通常都要在各个党组织中讨论。最近曾听取了阿里都斯县的“彼尔穆那斯”集体农场党书记和玛热克县维克什尼亚乡委会书记的报告。维利纽斯制革工厂党书记的报告，都是具有教育意义的。
    党的县委会对干部教育事业变得更加注意了。犹尔巴尔克县委会即是一个例子。犹尔巴尔克县是两年前组织起来的。领导者是年青的干部。党的县委会正确地决定了：事业的成功系于党的基层组织及乡委会的战斗力。县委会的工作者时常下乡去深刻了解党的基层组织的活动，在当地即给与它们实际的帮助。个别党组织的肯定经验就成为全县共产党员的财产了。这一切都促使该县顺利地完成着集体农场建设的任务。
    干部在布尔塞维克的严格性与坚决地和缺点斗争中长大并锻炼着。党的领导机关的责任，是经常地努力于作好干部工作，使他们对所负责任献出最大的力量。检查党的决议及训令的执行情况，是教育党组织和每个共产党员最有效的方法。立陶宛共产党中央委员会，加强了对联共（布）中央委员会及其自己决议执行的监督，近来对特拉卡、乌克米尔、塔乌拉和其他一些党组织的业务都进行了检查。在检查的过程中，暴露了某些县委会的工作方式中，党的和政治的宣传组织方法以及在选拔和教育干部中的一些重大缺点。
    中央委员会所采取的方法，肯定地改善了这些党组织的业务。
    立陶宛布尔塞维克第六次大会，向斯大林同志提出了保证：最近数年中，集体农场制度要在共和国内获得完全的胜利；尽力提前完成五年计划；使立陶宛人民的文化达到进一步的繁荣；改善党组织的思想及组织工作；提高革命的警惕性；坚决地和资产阶级民族主义最小的表现斗争。共和国的党组织要尽一切力量以使这些保证光荣完成。
