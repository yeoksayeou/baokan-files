　　Hebei News: The broad masses of working women in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, are actively participating in field production after suffering serious flooding. According to statistics from twelve counties including Changli, Luannan, Lulong, Yutian, and Funing, a total of 648,585 women participated in the autumn harvest. In Luannan County, 21,717 women participated in the autumn harvest last year, but this year the number reached over 55,500, an increase of more than double. In the Linyu New District near Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, women rarely participated in major labor in the past, but this year, in twenty-three villages where 100% of the female labor force participated in field production in both the old and new districts, 74% participated in 158 villages, and 65% in 31 villages. As a result, the entire district quickly finished the harvest and planted wheat ahead of schedule.

　　During wheat planting, many women used their cherished jewelry to exchange for wheat seeds in order to expand the wheat fields. In one village in the Second District of Luannan alone, women exchanged over 700 jin of wheat seeds for jewelry and dowries. Rong Xiuzhi and Zheng Yuqin, Party members from Donglianggezhuang in the Sixth District, planted eight mu of wheat with hoes. In the Seventh District of Leting, 753 women throughout the district participated in planting wheat at night with lanterns and by moonlight, planting 402 mu of wheat. According to statistics from twelve counties including Zunhua, Yutian, Fengrun, Funing, and Luanxian, 236,653 women participated in wheat planting. Furthermore, according to statistics from nine counties including Yutian, Qian'an, Lulong, and Luannan, women cooperated with men to organize 12,608 mutual aid teams, totaling 119,146 people.

　　During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, they also enthusiastically helped families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers with cultivation. For example, Li Xinghua from Zhang'an Village in the Fourth District of Leting hauled manure for military families for an entire night. In the entire village, over 120 women completed the planting of all 1,115 mu of land belonging to themselves and families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers within three days.

　　河北唐山专区六十四万妇女参加田间生产
    【本报讯】河北唐山专区的广大劳动妇女，在遭受了严重的水灾以后，积极参加田间生产。据昌黎、滦南、卢龙、玉田、抚宁等十二个县统计，参加秋收的妇女，共六十四万八千五百八十五人。滦南县去年参加秋收的妇女二万一千七百一十七人，今年参加的达五万五千五百余人，增加了一倍多。过去在山海关、秦皇岛附近的临榆新区妇女，很少参加主要劳动，但今年全县新老区妇女劳动力百分之百参加田间生产的二十三个村，百分之七十四参加田间生产的一百五十八个村，百分之六十五的三十一个村。因此使全区收割很快结束；并提前种麦。
    种麦时，好多妇女用自己心爱的首饰换麦种，以扩大麦田，仅滦南二区一个村妇女就用首饰嫁妆等换了麦种七百多斤。六区东梁各庄党员荣秀芝和郑玉琴，两个人用镐刨种麦子八亩。乐亭七区，全区妇女参加夜间打灯笼、趁月亮种麦的就有七百五十三个人，种麦四百零二亩。据遵化、玉田、丰润、抚宁、滦县等十二个县统计：妇女参加种麦的达二十三万六千六百五十三人。又据玉田、迁安、卢龙、滦南等九个县统计：妇女配合男子共组织起了一万二千六百零八个互助组，共有十一万九千一百四十六人。
    秋收种麦中，她们还热心地帮助烈、军、工属代耕。如乐亭四区张庵村李兴华，一夜给军属捣一圈粪，全村一百二十多妇女，三天内把自己和烈、军、工属的共一千一百一十五亩地全部种完。
