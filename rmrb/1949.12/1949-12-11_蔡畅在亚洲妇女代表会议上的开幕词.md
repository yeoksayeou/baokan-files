Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th: Cai Chang's full opening speech at the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows:

Dear sisters! Friends!

With immense excitement, I, on behalf of the presidium, declare the Asian Women's Representative Conference officially open.

The Asian Women's Representative Conference is convened under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation. The Women's International Democratic Federation has always shown deep sympathy and support for the suffering of oppressed women in colonial and semi-colonial countries and their struggles for liberation. As early as September 1947, the Women's International Democratic Federation decided to hold a women's conference in the Orient for colonial and dependent countries in 1948. To prepare for this, it sent a Southeast Asia study group to visit India, Burma, and Malaya. Later, it was specifically decided to hold the Asian Women's Representative Conference in Calcutta, India, in October 1948. At that time, it was not held due to obstruction by the reactionary Nehru government. However, the shameless tricks of the reactionaries could not suppress the development of mass enthusiasm. Just over a year later, the Asian Women's Representative Conference was able to be held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. This is a great victory for us, and Chinese women express their warm welcome and regard it as a great honor.

Democratic women around the world are paying deep attention to this conference, and they are providing active support in all aspects. In particular, women from Asian countries have sent representatives with boundless enthusiasm to attend. Some representatives have even braved the danger of their lives, breaking through the lines of fire and the eyes of secret agents and spies to reach their destination.

Why do sisters around the world and in Asia attach so much importance to this conference?

As everyone knows, this conference marks an unprecedented great unity of Asian women. We are united under a common will – to oppose imperialist wars of aggression, to strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy, and to strive for the complete liberation of oppressed nations in colonial and semi-colonial countries. This great will is the will of the Asian people and the will of the people all over the world. When we Asian women are strongly united and, through this unity, more closely united with women around the world, we think: what a tremendous force this will be! In the cause of world peace and democracy, we will continue our past work and make even greater achievements!

Friends! This great unity is fully demonstrated by the gathering of sisters present here, which fully illustrates the strength of its camp and the firmness of its forces.

The sisters of the socialist Soviet Asian republics have not only long since freed themselves from all oppression, but also, together with their entire Soviet people, are at the forefront of defending world peace and democracy; therefore, they are extending a hand of friendship to all oppressed and enslaved women. They are our living example. In hard and difficult struggles, we should remember them and strive with great effort to achieve the same glory as them.

The women of Southeast Asia and the Near East, under the rule of imperialism and their own feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie, the misery of their lives and the lives of their children is indescribable. However, their will, like the will of all mankind, is forever unyielding. They are fighting extremely bravely together with the people of the whole country.

Their struggle is not isolated. Women all over Asia support them, and women all over the world also support them. This conference will further demonstrate the strength of this support. After this conference, I believe they will fight more bravely!

The establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, these four new types of countries, points out the path for the struggle of Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries. With the cooperation of the world's forces for peace and democracy, they have achieved brilliant victories, especially the victory of the Chinese people, which has brought greater joy to the oppressed nations of Asia. The women of these four countries have made outstanding achievements in the fact of their national liberation, and these achievements will serve as valuable blueprints for women who are still enslaved and exploited by imperialism and their own feudal comprador forces.

Friends! Does the above not show the unprecedented great unity of Asian women? Is this unity not enough to make women all over the world rejoice and make imperialism and all reactionary forces fear?

But the expression of this power does not stop there. We also want to welcome our guests with even greater excitement. Their participation adds even greater significance to our conference, making our Asian women and women all over the world more closely united.

Women representatives of the great Soviet Union have come here from Moscow, and they have demonstrated their great assistance to Asian women through their enthusiastic work.

Women representatives from the Czechoslovak Republic, progressive women representatives from Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and women representatives from oppressed countries in Cuba and Africa, have all come for the common purpose of striving for lasting world peace and people's democracy.

These facts give us a common feeling: our unity, our strength, is embodied so deeply and so broadly in representatives of different languages and different skin colors, and the spirit and emotion of internationalism permeates all our work! It will forever illuminate us until we fight to the final victory!

Showing unity and expressing strength, this is one aspect of the spirit of our conference, and undoubtedly, it is an important aspect; however, we must not ignore another, more important aspect, which is to exchange experiences and learn from each other, thereby uniting more closely and striving for the early realization of our common goals.

Regarding the struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and lasting world peace, and regarding the protection of the rights of women and children, detailed provisions have been made on our agenda. We will exchange opinions extensively, and in discussing these issues, we will understand each other and learn many things from each other. Here, I only intend to talk about the relationship between national liberation and women's liberation, in order to draw the attention of the representatives to this issue, because this issue is an extremely important issue in Asia.

Let me talk about Chinese women's liberation and the liberation of the Chinese nation! Because on the one hand, I grew up in China, and vivid facts have educated me, and on the other hand, the victory of the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, is, in a sense, a decisive victory.

Chinese women have been fighting for national liberation together with the Chinese people, from 1919 to the present, for thirty years.

For thirty years, the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle for national independence and people's democracy has been led by the Chinese Communist Party, going through the revolution of 1925 to 1927, the land revolutionary war of 1927 to 1937, the anti-Japanese war of 1937 to 1945, and the people's liberation war of 1946 to the present.

These thirty years have been extremely arduous, but Chinese women have learned from practical experience that only after overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its lackeys can women achieve liberation. Therefore, they have stepped forward one after another, sacrificed heroically, and consistently participated in the great struggles for national independence and people's democracy in various periods, and the women's movement has developed along with the development of the entire revolution.

Now, the new China of the people is born, the Chinese nation has been freed from the fate of being a colonial and semi-colonial country, and Chinese women have also stood up. They have not only gained equal rights with men, but also, because they have suffered deeper and heavier pain and oppression in the old society, the policy program of the new China also has special provisions to take care of the rights and interests of women and children, and these provisions have been implemented in practical work in all liberated cities and villages.

All countries that have been liberated from the status of colonial and semi-colonial nations are proving a truth: the women's liberation movement is a part of the national liberation movement, and the women's liberation movement must be closely integrated with the national liberation movement in order to make the cause of national liberation victorious, and at the same time, the women's liberation movement can also be victorious.

Every representative present is watching the women's movement in the Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries with infinite sincerity.

The national liberation struggle in Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries is developing vigorously, and the imperialist war-mongers will certainly not be reconciled. Their aggression and oppression will inevitably intensify, and their conspiracies and tricks will inevitably become more and more vicious. They collude with national traitors in these countries to destroy progressive organizations, arrest and massacre leaders and activists of national movements, and naturally, democratic women's organizations and their leaders will not be an exception. We respect and mourn these heroic victims. We must turn this respect and mourning into strength. We must unite more closely. For national liberation, for the happiness of ourselves and our children, and for the peaceful and beautiful future of all mankind, we will fight unhesitatingly, vigilantly, and flexibly against imperialism and our own reactionary governments!

We have full confidence in leading the struggle to victory, because of the existence, development, and consolidation of the powerful world democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the assistance of brothers and sisters from countries that have already won victory.

We will make great efforts to complete all the work of the conference. This work has been entrusted to us by women all over Asia. Millions of eyes and millions of hearts are looking up to us and expecting us. Our efforts will erect a solid milestone for the unity and liberation of Asian women.

We wish the conference a complete success!

Long live the unity of Asian and world democratic women!

Long live the victory of the liberation of all oppressed nations and oppressed women in Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries!

Long live the Women's International Democratic Federation! (Attached picture)

　　蔡畅在亚洲妇女代表会议上的开幕词
    【新华社北京十日电】蔡畅在亚洲妇女代表会议上的开幕词全文如下：
    亲爱的姐妹们！朋友们！
    我以万分兴奋的心情代表主席团宣布亚洲妇女代表会议正式开幕。
    亚洲妇女代表会议是在国际民主妇联领导之下召开的。国际民主妇联对于殖民地、半殖民地国家被压迫妇女的痛苦和她们求解放的斗争，一向寄予深厚的同情和支持。早在一九四七年九月国际民主妇联就决定要在一九四八年内在东方召开一个殖民地和附属国的妇女会议，为了进行准备工作，曾派出东南亚考察团，访问了印度、缅甸和马来亚。之后，更具体地决定在一九四八年十月召开亚洲妇女代表会议于印度加尔各答。当时，由于尼赫鲁反动政府的阻挠而没有开成。可是反动分子无耻的伎俩，压制不了群众积极性的发展，相隔仅仅一年余，亚洲妇女代表会议就能在中华人民共和国的首都——北京举行了。这是我们一个伟大的胜利，中国妇女对此表示热烈的欢迎，并引为极大的荣幸。
    全世界的民主妇女，都对这个会议给予极深刻的关怀，她们在各方面给予积极的支援。特别是亚洲各国的妇女们，她们以无限的热忱派遣代表来出席，有些代表还是冒着生命危险，冲破了火线和特务与密探的视线而来到目的地的。
    为什么全世界和亚洲的姐妹们如此重视这个会议呢？
    大家知道：这个会议标志着亚洲妇女空前的大团结，我们团结在一个共同的意志之下——反对帝国主义的侵略战争，争取世界持久和平与人民民主，争取殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族的彻底解放。这个伟大意志是亚洲人民的意志，也是全世界人民的意志。当我们亚洲妇女坚强团结并通过这种团结与世界妇女更亲密地团结起来时，我们想到：这会是一支多么巨大的力量！在世界和平民主事业上，我们将继续过去的工作，作出更大的成绩来！
    朋友们！这个伟大的团结，从到会的姊妹们的济济一堂，就完全说明了其阵营的壮大和力量的坚强。
    社会主义苏维埃亚洲各共和国的姊妹们，她们不独早已摆脱了一切压迫，而且和他们整个苏联人民一起是捍卫世界和平民主的先锋；因此她们向一切被压迫被奴役的妇女们伸着友谊的手。她们是我们活生生的榜样，在艰苦困难斗争中，我们当记起她们，将以极大的努力来取得像她们同样的光荣。
    东南亚与近东各国的妇女们，她们在帝国主义及本国的封建地主和买办资产阶级的统治下，她们和她们的孩子们的生活的悲惨，是难以形容的。但是，她们的意志和全人类的意志一样是永远不可屈服的，她们和全国人民在一起，进行着极英勇的斗争。
    她们的斗争不是孤立的，全亚洲的妇女支持着她们，全世界的妇女也在支持着她们，这次会议将更加显示这种支持的力量，经过这次会议，我相信，她们会斗争得更勇敢！
    中华人民共和国，蒙古人民共和国，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，越南人民共和国，这四个新型的国家的建立，指明了亚洲殖民地半殖民地斗争的道路。在世界和平民主力量的配合下，他们取得了辉煌的胜利，特别是中国人民的胜利，为亚洲被压迫民族带来了更大的喜悦。这四个国家的妇女在她们民族解放的事实中，有着卓越的成就，这些成就将使还在帝国主义和本国封建买办势力奴役压榨下的妇女作为宝贵的蓝本。
    朋友们！以上说明不是显示了亚洲妇女空前的大团结么？这种团结不足以使全世界妇女欢欣鼓舞，使帝国主义及一切反动势力恐惧么？
    但是，这力量的表现还不止此，我们还要以更大的兴奋来欢迎我们的来宾。她们的参加，对于我们这次会议增加了更重大的意义，使我们亚洲妇女和全世界妇女更亲密地团结起来了。
    伟大的苏联的妇女代表，从莫斯科来到这里，她们以自己热情的工作说明了对亚洲妇女伟大的援助。
    捷克人民共和国的妇女代表，英、美、法、荷等国进步的妇女代表，古巴非洲被压迫国家的妇女代表，她们都是为着争取世界持久和平与人民民主的共同目的而来的。
    这些事实，使我们有一个共同感觉：我们的团结，我们的力量，在不同语言不同肤色的代表身上体现得如此之深，如此之广，国际主义的精神和感情洋溢在我们的一切工作中！它将永远照耀着我们一直斗争到最后胜利！
    显示了团结，表现了力量，这是我们会议的精神的一方面，无疑的，这是重要的一方面；然而我们不要忽视，还有另一个更重要的方面，这就是交流经验，互相学习，借此来团结得更紧，争取我们共同目的的早日实现。
    关于争取民族独立、人民民主与世界持久和平，关于保卫妇女儿童的权利等问题，在我们的议事日程上已有详细规定，我们将会广泛地交换意见，在讨论这些问题中，我们会互相了解，互相学习到许多东西。在这里，我只准备说一说民族解放与妇女解放的关系问题，以便提起代表们对这个问题的注意，因为，这个问题在亚洲来说是一个极其重大的问题。
    让我来谈谈中国妇女解放与中华民族解放吧！因为一则我生长在中国，活生生的事实教育了我，另一方面，占全世界人口四分之一的中国人民的胜利，在某种意义上来说，是决定性的胜利。
    中国妇女和中国人民在一起进行着民族解放斗争，从一九一九年起，到现在已经三十年了。
    三十年来，中国人民为了民族独立与人民民主的革命斗争，是在中国共产党领导下，经过了一九二五至一九二七年的革命，一九二七至一九三七年的土地革命战争，一九三七年至一九四五年的抗日战争，及一九四六年至现在的人民解放战争。
    这三十年是极其艰苦的，但中国妇女从实际经验中了解，只有在推翻帝国主义及其走狗的统治以后，妇女才能获得解放，因而她们前仆后继，英勇牺牲，始终不渝地参加了各个时期的伟大的民族独立与人民民主的斗争，妇女运动也随着整个革命的发展而发展起来。
    现在人民的新中国诞生了，中华民族已经摆脱了殖民地半殖民地的厄运，而中国妇女也已站立起来了，她们不独获得了与男子一样的平等的权利，而且，因为她们在旧社会所受的痛苦和压迫更深更重，新中国的施政纲领上还有特别照顾妇女儿童权益的规定，这些规定在一切解放了的城市和乡村都贯彻到实际工作中了。
    一切从殖民地半殖民地民族地位得到解放的国家，都证明着一个真理：妇女解放运动是民族解放运动的一部分，必须使妇女解放运动和民族解放运动密切结合起来，才能使民族解放事业胜利开展，同时，妇女解放运动也才能胜利开展。
    每一个到会代表都以无限的诚意注视着亚洲殖民地半殖民地国家的妇女运动。
    亚洲殖民地半殖民地国家的民族解放斗争，正在日益蓬勃发展，而帝国主义者战争贩子们当然是不会甘心的，他们的侵略和压迫必然日益加紧，他们的阴谋诡计，必然会愈来愈毒辣。他们和这些国家内的民族叛徒勾结起来，摧残进步组织，逮捕和屠杀民族运动的领袖和积极分子，对民主妇女团体和他的领导人，自然也不会例外。对于这些遇难的英雄们，我们敬重她们，哀悼她们，我们要把这种敬重和哀悼化成力量，我们要更紧密地团结起来，为了民族解放，为了自身和孩子们的幸福，为了全人类和平美好的将来，毫不犹豫地、机警地、灵活地为反对帝国主义及本国反动政府而斗争不息！
    我们有着充分的信心把斗争引向胜利，因为有强大的以苏联为首的世界民主和平阵营的存在发展和巩固，有国际民主妇联的领导，有已经胜利了的国家的兄弟姊妹们的援助。
    我们将以极大的努力来完成大会的一切工作，这些工作，是全亚洲的妇女们所付托给我们的，千千万万的眼、千千万万的心，都在仰望着我们，期待着我们，我们的努力，将为亚洲妇女的团结和解放树立起一块坚实的里程碑。
    我们预祝会议圆满成功！
    亚洲和世界民主妇女团结万岁！
    亚洲一切殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族、被压迫妇女解放胜利万岁！
    国际民主妇联万岁！（附图片）
