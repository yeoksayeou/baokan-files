Xinhua News Agency, Beijing: To welcome the approaching first New Year of the People's Republic of China, art circles in various regions have launched the creation and publication of New Year pictures. The Art Studio of the Military Control Commission of Shanghai has adopted the most popular folk New Year picture format and has already created twelve New Year pictures, including "Celebrating the Founding of the People's Republic of China," "The People Are Emancipated and the Whole World Celebrates," "Supporting the Front and Returning in Glory," "Democratic Elections," and "Building a Family Through Labor." The Shanghai Artists Association is also dividing tasks to paint New Year pictures based on the content of the documents from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Other art publishing companies have also published calendars and monthly calendars with new content. The Tianjin Artists Association convened a forum on New Year picture reform on the 2nd of this month, inviting the city's New Year picture industry. Professors at the National Hangzhou Academy of Art launched a New Year picture creation campaign at the end of November. Professors such as Yan Han and Pan Yun have already created more than 30 New Year pictures, including "Democratic Anti-Hegemony Great Emancipation," "Children Present Flowers to Chairman Mao," and "Men Farm and Women Weave." The Hangzhou Artists Association is also rushing to produce New Year pictures to meet the needs of farmers. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association has already printed "The Founding of the Central People's Government," "Victory of the Liberation War," and various New Year pictures related to production and cultural construction.

This newspaper reports from Shanxi: The Taiyuan Printing Company will publish 500,000 copies of New Year pictures by the end of the year, which will be distributed and sold by Xinhua bookstores in various regions. A month ago, the preparatory office of the Shanxi Provincial Artists Association was responsible for soliciting New Year picture submissions. After reviewing the submissions, a total of 20 pieces were selected, including Li Qun's "Reading the Newspaper" (with a lunar calendar) and Zhao Fengchuan's "Li Shunda's Family." All New Year pictures are exquisitely produced using four-color offset printing on woodfree paper, in two sizes: quarto and octavo.
