　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 23rd: The People's Liberation Army's East China Military Region and the Third Field Army units stationed in Nanjing warmly celebrated Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday on the 21st. In addition to representatives from directly subordinate units participating in the Nanjing celebration meeting, various Nanjing garrison units also held separate celebration meetings. Leaders of each unit reported on Stalin's life and his great contributions to the world revolution and the Chinese revolution at the meetings, calling on all commanders and fighters to implement the spirit of internationalism and strive to learn from the Soviet Red Army. Each unit's meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin. In addition, each unit also held a general discussion, discussing Chen Boda's essay "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution." Each unit's newspaper published a special issue commemorating Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, introducing Stalin's deeds and the current state of Soviet construction. On the same day, all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch of the East China Military and Political University and more than 2,000 cadres above the company level held a grand celebration evening.
    Prior to this, the commanders and fighters of the Third Field Army had written letters to congratulate Marshal Stalin on his 70th birthday. Some soldiers in a certain unit's guard battalion rewrote their letters as many as three times because they felt that what they had written could not fully express their feelings. These letters were filled with praise and love for Stalin. Wang Yurun, a correspondent of the 1st Company, wrote in his letter: "Under your leadership, the Soviet Red Army and the power of the broad masses of the people of the world defeated the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, liberated many European countries, and helped us liberate the Northeast. The day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union under your leadership was the first to establish diplomatic relations with our country. We are very grateful for your consistent sincere assistance and lofty friendship to the Chinese people. We are determined to learn from the Soviet people under your leadership, especially the Soviet Red Army's high political consciousness, modern military technology, and great spirit of internationalism." Wang Fugui, a soldier from the 2nd Company, wrote in his congratulatory letter: "Comrade Stalin, the savior of mankind, I am a people's soldier under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, and I will forever stand on the side of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and fight to the end for world peace and people's democracy!" Xu Yunwu, a fighter from the 2nd Platoon of the machine gun company, wrote a rhythmic verse praising Stalin: "A thousand years of red, ten thousand years of green, Comrade Stalin is like the sun, forever shining brightly."

    热烈庆祝斯大林寿辰
    努力向苏联红军学习
    【新华社南京二十三日电】人民解放军华东军区暨第三野战军驻南京各部于二十一日热烈庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰。除直属队代表参加南京各界的祝寿大会外，南京警备部队各部并分别举行了祝寿大会。各部首长都在大会上报告了斯大林的生平及其对世界革命和中国革命的伟大贡献，号召全体指战员贯彻国际主义的精神，努力向苏联红军学习。各部大会上都通过了致斯大林大元帅的贺电。此外各部又普遍举行了座谈会，讨论了陈伯达的“斯大林与中国革命”的论文。各部报纸都出版了纪念斯大林同志七十寿辰的特刊，介绍斯大林的事迹及苏联的建设现状。同日华东军政大学中苏友好协会支会全体会员及连以上干部共两千余人举行了盛大的庆祝晚会。
    在此以前，第三野战军指战员，纷纷写信祝贺斯大林大元帅七十寿辰。某部警卫营有的战士因写得不能完全表达心意而改写达三次之多。这些信中充满了对斯大林的颂赞和热爱。一连通讯员王玉润在信上写着：“在你领导下，苏联红军和世界广大人民的力量，打败了德、意、日法西斯，解放了欧洲许多国家，又帮助我们解放东北。中华人民共和国成立第二天，你领导下的苏联首先与我国建立帮交。你对中国人民一贯的真诚援助的崇高的友情，我们非常感激。我们决向在你领导下的苏联人民学习，特别要学习苏联红军高度的政治觉悟，现代化的军事技术与伟大的国际主义精神。”二连战士王富贵在贺信中写道：“人类的救星伟大的斯大林同志，我是毛泽东主席领导下的人民战士，我永远站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的一边，为世界持久和平和人民民主奋斗到底！”机枪连二班战士徐蕴武在信上写了一首歌颂斯大林的快板：“千年红，万年青，斯大林同志象太阳永远放光明。”
