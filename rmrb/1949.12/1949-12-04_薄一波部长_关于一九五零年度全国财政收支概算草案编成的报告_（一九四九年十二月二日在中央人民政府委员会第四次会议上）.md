First of all, it should be stated that this budget draft is compiled based on incomplete materials and estimated through experience. Therefore, it can only draw an outline and a basic direction. Many figures are estimates, but they are based on evidence, close to reality, and relatively reliable. The percentages of various items in the expenditure of this budget are as follows: military expenditure 38.8%, administrative expenditure 21.4%, investment in state-owned enterprises 23.9%, cultural, educational, and health expenditure 4.1%, local subsidies 2.3%, principal and interest repayment of Northeast public bonds 0.1%, and general reserve fund 9.4%. The percentages of various items in the revenue of this budget are as follows: agricultural tax revenue 41.4%, various tax revenues 38.9%, enterprise revenue 17.1%, revenue from clearing warehouses 2.4%, and other revenue 0.2%. The total revenue is only 81.3% of the total expenditure, and the remaining 18.7% is a deficit. We have two ways to solve the deficit: one is to rely on issuing public bonds, which solves 38.4% of the deficit; the other is to rely on bank overdrafts, that is, issuing currency, which solves 61.6% of the deficit. I would now like to briefly explain the basic spirit of this budget draft and the guarantees for its realization as follows:

(A) Guarantee victory in the war and gradually restore production.

	1. Military expenditure accounts for 38.8% of the estimated expenditure, which is the largest percentage in the draft. In addition, local support-the-front expenses in administrative expenses, initial expenses for military control of newly liberated cities, and transportation expenses in financial expenses are also actually for war expenditure. Therefore, this budget draft is basically still aimed at guaranteeing victory in the war as its primary task. It should be noted that we are still in a period of war, and the proportion of military expenditure is not considered large.

	2. Administrative expenditure accounts for 21.4%, the main items of which are the living expenses and miscellaneous expenses of public employees. The reason why this number is so large is that we not only have to supply the public employees of the People's Government, but also the old public employees. Together with military personnel, it is estimated that in 1950, the country will need to support 9 million military, government, and public education personnel who are detached from production, accounting for about 2% of the national population. That is, every 100 people need to support two "public servants." This is a heavy burden for the People's Government, but it is an unavoidable burden. It is the responsibility of the People's Government to take over all the old army and old public employees, provide them with a way out of life, gradually transform them, and prepare to transfer them to economic construction in one or two years, and slowly reduce them. This policy has already been decided. But as a result, the military expenditure and administrative expenditure account for more than 60% of the total estimated expenditure, and the direct and indirect expenditure of military and government personnel accounts for the main part. However, personal income is still very low. The standard of the People's Liberation Army has been very low for many years, and it has a tradition of hard struggle. Now that the country has basically won, the lives of military and government personnel can theoretically be improved, but we still ask them to continue to endure hardship for a few more years, which is beneficial to consolidating the victory, and the purpose is to squeeze out a little money for the purpose of restoring and developing production.

	3. Investment in economic construction accounts for 23.9% of the estimated expenditure. The percentage is not very large, but it is not bad to have such a percentage during the war. In order to guarantee this percentage, 9 million people need to tighten their belts, be careful in their calculations, and squeeze it out penny by penny. The long-term war has caused extremely serious damage to industry, agriculture, railways, etc. It is estimated that the degree of economic damage in China is more than 50% compared with before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Coupled with years of floods and droughts, the national economy will not be easily restored without making an effort. Therefore, no matter how difficult our country is, we must plan and step by step squeeze out some money and use it to restore production.

	4. Cultural, educational, and health expenditures account for 4.1% of the estimated expenditure. If the expenses of cultural, educational, and health personnel are added, it will exceed this percentage and reach 6% of the estimated expenditure. Even so, the cultural, educational, and health expenditures are still very small, but this is not bad given the continuation of the war and the extreme economic damage.

(B) Taking both the amount of income and expenditure into consideration, taking it reasonably and using it properly.

	1. Continue to require farmers to bear the burden. For the past twelve years, farmers have contributed the greatest strength to the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation by contributing people and money, which is the most worthy of gratitude. In the 1950 revenue budget, agricultural tax revenue still ranks first, accounting for 41.4% of the total revenue. The average burden on farmers nationwide accounts for just over 19% of their total agricultural income, while the old liberated areas account for 21% of their total agricultural income. For the sake of victory and economic recovery, the burden on farmers cannot be reduced for a while.

	2. Require industrialists and businessmen to bear the burden. Various taxes account for 38.9% of the estimated revenue, which is the second largest source of revenue. According to various statistical materials before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the proportion of tax revenue should be increased, but this is because the economy of major cities has not fully recovered shortly after liberation, and second, because we have a small number of workers and poor experience, we cannot do it for a while. A considerable part of the tax revenue, such as salt tax, customs duty, commodity tax, transaction tax, and slaughter tax, is basically borne by consumers, mainly farmers. In order to make the burden rationally distributed, the issuance of public bonds is mainly placed on cities and on industrialists and businessmen.

	3. Also require military, government, and public education personnel to guarantee. Require guaranteeing agricultural tax revenue and reducing losses; require guaranteeing tax revenue and reducing tax evasion; require doing a good job in promoting public bonds and guaranteeing the completion of tasks; require all management personnel of public enterprises to carefully calculate and implement cost accounting and economic accounting systems, operate enterprises well, reduce waste, and guarantee revenue; require military, government, and public education personnel to recognize the difficulties in victory, not to complain about living a little harder, and to handle things according to their importance and urgency, not to start everything at once, and to guarantee that the estimated expenditure is not exceeded.

(C) Realizing the 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget is a serious struggle task. To guarantee that every item of income does not fall short, it is necessary for the people's governments at all levels to make great efforts and do a series of tasks to complete it. Guaranteeing that expenditures do not exceed the budget requires the staff of all levels and departments to restrain themselves, and to make strict calculations for every matter and every enterprise they manage, which can only be achieved through struggles in various aspects and very careful calculations. After the Central People's Government approves this budget draft, it requires all military, government, and public education personnel and all democratic parties and democratic figures to fight against behaviors that violate, fail to implement, or undermine the national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget.

(D) Realizing the 1950 fiscal revenue and expenditure budget is a major struggle, as mentioned above. But, if this budget draft is fully realized, will the situation be better? This goes without saying. It is beneficial to stabilizing people's livelihoods and developing production, and the price situation will be much better than in 1949. But this does not mean that we can completely sit back and relax. There are still many difficulties, including expected difficulties and unexpected difficulties, which require us to work hard to overcome.

　　薄一波部长
    关于一九五零年度全国财政收支概算草案编成的报告
    （一九四九年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上）
    首先应该声明，这个概算草案是根据不完全的材料加上经验推算估计所编成的。因此，它只能画出一个轮廓、一个基本方向出来。许多数目字都是估计的，但是有根据的，是接近实际的，比较可靠的。这个概算的支出项下，各种科目所占的百分比如下：军事费百分之三十八点八，行政费百分之二十一点四，国营企业投资百分之二十三点九，文化教育卫生费百分之四点一，地方补助费百分之二点三，东北公债还本付息百分之零点一，总预备费百分之九点四。这个概算的收入项下，各种科目所占百分比如下：公粮收入百分之四十一点四，各项税收百分之三十八点九，企业收入百分之十七点一，清理仓库收入百分之二点四，其他收入百分之零点二。这个收入总额，仅合支出总额的百分之八十一点三，其余的百分之十八点七则是赤字即亏欠。我们解决赤字的办法是两个：一个是依靠发行公债，解决赤字的百分之三十八点四；另一个是依靠银行透支，即发行货币，解决赤字的百分之六十一点六。我现在谨将本概算草案的基本精神和实现的保证加以简单说明如下：
    （甲）保证战争胜利，逐步恢复生产。
    １、军费占支出概算的百分之三八点八，是草案中所占百分比最大的一项。此外，行政费中的地方支前费，新解放城市军管初期经费，财务费中的运输费等，实际上也是为战争支出的。所以这个概算草案基本上仍然是以保证战争胜利为主要任务。应当说明，我们还在战争时期，军费所占比例并不算大。
    ２、行政费占百分之二十一点四，其中主要的项目是公教人员的生活费和公杂费。这个数目所以有这样大，是因为我们不但要供给人民政府的公教人员，而且要供给旧公教人员。连军事的人员在一起，一九五零年度全国占计需养活军政公教脱离生产人员九百万人，约占全国人口的百分之二。即每一百人需养活两个“公家人”。这对人民政府是一个很大的负担，但这又是一个不可避免的负担。把所有旧军队旧公教人员一齐包下来，给以生活的出路，逐渐加以改造，并准备在一二年内转入经济建设，慢慢地减少下来，是人民政府的责任。这一条政策是已经定下来的。但因此也就使军事费与行政费所占全部支出概算的百分比占百分之六十以上，其中军政人员直接间接的开支又占主要部分。但个人生活所得，还是很低的。人民解放军多年来的标准就是很低的，它有艰苦奋斗的传统作风。现在全国已经基本胜利，军政人员生活，论理可以改善些，但我们还要求他们继续再吃几年苦，这对巩固胜利是有好处的，其目的在于挤出一点钱来，做恢复与发展生产之用。
    ３、经济建设的投资占支出概算的百分之二十三点九，百分比不算很大，但在战争时期能有这样百分比，也算不错了。为要保证这一百分比，需要九百万人节衣缩食，精打细算，一文一文地挤出来。长期战争对于工业、农业、铁路等的破坏极严重，估计中国经济破坏的程度与抗战前比较，有些地区达到百分之五十以上，加上连年水旱等灾荒，不努一把力，国民经济是不易加以恢复的。因此，无论我们国家怎样困难，也得有计划有步骤地挤出一些钱来，用在恢复生产上。
    ４、文教卫生费用，占支出概算的百分之四点一。如果把文教卫生人员的开支加进去，就会超过这一百分比，达到支出概算的百分之六。虽然这样，文教卫生费还是很小的，但这在战争继续进行和经济破坏极大的情况下，也算是不错的。
    （乙）量出为入与量入为出兼顾，取之合理，用之得当。
    １、继续要求农民担负。十二年以来，农民为抗日战争和解放战争，出人出钱，贡献了最大力量，这是最值得感谢的事。一九五零年的收入概算中，公粮收入仍占第一位，占全部收入的百分之四一点四。全国农民平均负担占其农业总收入的百分之一九强，而老解放区则占其农业总收入的百分之二一。为了胜利与恢复经济，农民负担一时是无法减轻的。
    ２、要求工商业者担负。各项税占收入概算的百分之三八点九，是收入的第二位。按抗战前各种材料统计，税收的比例数还应该增大，但一因各大城市解放不久经济尚未完全恢复，二因我们工人人员数量少、经验差，一时还做不到。税收中有不少一部分如盐税、关税、货物税、交易税、屠宰税等，基本上是由消费者负担的，其中主要还是农民。为了使负担有合理的分配，公债的发行，主要放在城市放在工商业者身上。
    ３、也要向军政公教人员要求保证。要求保证公粮收入，减少损耗；要求保证税收，减少偷漏；要求把推行公债的工作做好，保证完成任务；要求所有公营企业经营人员，精打细算，实行成本会计，经济核算制，把企业办好，减少浪费，保证收入；要求军政公教人员认识胜利中的困难，生活过苦一点不要叫，事情应该分别轻重缓急来办，不要百废俱举，保证不突破支出概算。
    （丙）实现一九五零年度全国财政收支概算是一个严重的斗争任务。保证每一项收入不落空，就必需经过各级人民政府很大的努力，要做一系列的工作，才能完成。保证支出不超过概算，这就必需要求各级各部门的工作人员，约束自己，对自己所经管的每一件事所经管的每一企业，都要作严格的计算，经过对各方面的斗争和很周密仔细的计算才能做到。在中央人民政府通过这一概算草案以后，要求所有军政公教人员和各民主党派民主人士向违背、不执行或破坏全国财政收支概算的行为作斗争。
    （丁）实现一九五零年度财政收支概算是一个很大的斗争，如上所述。但，如果照这概算草案完满地实现了，情况是否会好些呢？这是不待言的。对安定民生发展生产是有利的，物价状况也会比一九四九年好得多。但这并不是说，完全可以高枕无忧。困难还很多，有预期以内的困难，还会有预期以外的困难，需要我们努力去克服。
