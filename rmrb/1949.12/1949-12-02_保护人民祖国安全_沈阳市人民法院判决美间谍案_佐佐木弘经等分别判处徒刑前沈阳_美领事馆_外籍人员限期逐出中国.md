Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 1st: The espionage case directed by the former U.S. Consulate in Shenyang was concluded and judged by the Shenyang People's Court on November 26th. The defendants Sasaki Hirotsuna and others were sentenced to imprisonment for two to six years. Chinese nationals were also deprived of their political rights for four to six years. All foreign personnel of the former Shenyang "U.S. Consulate," who covered up and directed this major espionage case, were sentenced to be expelled from China within a time limit. Those sentenced to six years of imprisonment include: Sasaki Hirotsuna (Japanese nationality, espionage code S.S.K., Chinese name Zhang Zhizhong, Japanese name Sakuma Kensuke), Boyan Cang (Chinese nationality, Inner Mongolian, espionage code TOAS No. 4, deprived of political rights for six years); those sentenced to five years of imprisonment are: Wu Renjie (Chinese nationality, Anglo-Chinese mixed race, alias Li Jiade); those sentenced to four years of imprisonment are: Xiao Yaoting (Chinese nationality), Sakashita Kiichi (Japanese nationality); those sentenced to three years of imprisonment are: Yang Zhaohe (Chinese nationality, Taiwanese, Japanese name Yanai Tomoichi), Yamamura Yoshiaki (Japanese nationality); those sentenced to two years of imprisonment are: Takeuchi Hajime (Japanese nationality). The legal proceedings against Cao Chengde (Chinese nationality, Inner Mongolian), who died on bail due to illness, were terminated.

　　The case was tried by the Shenyang People's Court on the morning of the 26th. On the prosecutor's table were piled up various criminal evidences of the espionage criminals, including paper bags and cloth bags of various sizes containing espionage plans, instruction letters, intelligence drafts, and American-made radios and transceivers. More than 30 newspaper, radio, and photography reporters and more than 300 representatives of organs and organizations sat in the audience. American citizen Mr. Stooke (former Deputy Consul of the "U.S. Consulate" in Shenyang) was also present to observe.

　　At 9:30, Judge Xu Lie, Judges Sun Qian and Qiao Zhuang, and Prosecutor Li Zhao and others took their seats. After the Judge announced the rules of the criminal court, the bailiffs escorted the espionage criminals into the criminal court and stood in the dock. The Judge then announced the official opening of the court. First, the prosecutor read out the indictment of the Shenyang Municipal Public Security Bureau. Whenever the evidence of the defendants' crimes was read, he pointed to or raised various documents on the table as evidence.

　　The interrogation began at 10:40 and ended at 2:20 in the afternoon. During this three-hour and forty-minute interrogation, individual interrogations and mutual confrontations were conducted. Each defendant confessed to the facts of the crime and signed and fingerprinted their confessions. Among them, the defendant Sasaki Hirotsuna confessed that he acted as a spy under the leadership of Nishida, an American Japanese national of the former U.S. Consulate, and met with Nishida seven times on the second floor of the former U.S. Consulate. He accepted the instructions of American imperialism, recruited Japanese spies and Mongolian Han traitors, probed into military and political intelligence, and prepared for American imperialism to establish a second Manchuria. The defendant Boyan Cang confessed that he was instructed by the American espionage agency to probe into Inner Mongolian military and political intelligence, and conspired to instigate a coup in Inner Mongolia in order to provoke Chinese national unity and facilitate American imperialism's goal of invading China. The defendant Wu Renjie confessed that he worked as a spy under the leadership of Hunter of the former U.S. Consulate and met with Hunter in Hunter's residence, one room away from Wald's office on the second floor of the former U.S. Consulate. These confessions exposed that the so-called "U.S. Consulate" was an espionage command agency. When Mr. Stooke, the former U.S. Deputy Consul in Shenyang, heard these confessions from the defendants, he was extremely embarrassed.

　　After the interrogation of the defendants, the prosecutor stood up to speak. He pointed out that this fair trial further confirmed that the various criminal facts reported were indeed true and correct. He requested that the espionage criminals be sanctioned by law, and that all foreign personnel of the former "U.S. Consulate" in Shenyang, who covered up and directed this major espionage case, should be dealt with to protect the security of the motherland. After a half-hour recess and deliberation, the sentence was pronounced at 3:00 PM, and the entire case was completed at 4:00 PM.

    前沈阳“美领事馆”外籍人员限期逐出中国
    【新华社沈阳一日电】沈阳美国前领事馆所指挥的间谍案，已于十一月二十六日，由沈阳市人民法院审结并判决。被告佐佐木弘经等，被处徒刑二年至六年。中国籍各犯并被褫夺公权四年至六年。掩护和指挥这一大间谍案的前沈阳“美国领事馆”内全体外籍人员，经判决限期驱逐出中国国境。计处六年徒刑者，有：佐佐木弘经（日本籍，间谍代号Ｓ·Ｓ·Ｋ·，中国化名张执中、日本化名佐久间健佑），伯彦苍（中国籍，内蒙古人，间谍代号ＴＯＡＳ四号，褫夺公权六年）；处徒刑五年者为：吴人杰（中国籍，中英混血儿，化名李嘉德）；处徒刑四年者为：肖耀庭（中国籍），坂下喜一（日本籍）；处徒刑三年者为：杨朝和（中国籍台湾人，日本化名柳井友一），山村嘉昭（日本籍）；处徒刑二年者为：竹内始（日本籍）。对因病保释在外死亡的曹承德（中国籍内蒙古人），则停止诉讼程序。
    此案由沈阳市人民法院于二十六日上午开庭审判。检察官席位的案头堆积着大大小小的装着间谍计划书、指示信、情报底稿的纸包布袋和美制电台、收发报机等间谍罪犯的各种犯罪证据。旁听席上坐着三十余名报纸、广播、摄影记者和机关、团体的代表三百余人。美侨史笃克（前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”副领事）也到场旁听。
    九时三十分审判长徐烈、审判员孙谦、乔庄，检察官李钊等就位。在审判长宣布刑庭规则后，法警即将间谍犯等押进刑庭，站立在被告席上。审判长乃宣布正式开庭。首由检察官朗读沈阳市人民政府公安局的起诉，书每读到被告等犯罪的证据时，便指着或举起案头的各种证件作证。
    十时四十分开始审讯，下午二时二十分审讯完毕。在这三点四十分的审讯过程中，进行了个别审讯及相互对证，各犯一一承认犯罪事实，并在口供上签名打手印。其中被告佐佐木弘经供称：他充当间谍系受前美国领事馆美籍日人西田领导，曾在前美国领事馆二楼与西田接头七次。他接受美帝国主义的指示，网罗日本特务，蒙汉奸细，刺探军政情报，准备美国帝国主义建立第二个满洲国。被告伯彦苍供认，他是受美国间谍机关指使，刺探内蒙古军政情报，并阴谋在内蒙古策动政变，以挑拨中国民族团结，便利美帝国主义达到侵略中国的目的。被告吴人杰公认，他是在前美国领事馆亨特的领导下做间谍，曾在前美国领事馆的二楼与瓦尔德办公室隔一间房子的亨特住处，和亨特接头。这些招供，暴露出所谓“美国领事馆”是间谍指挥机关。前美驻沈副领事美侨史笃克听到被告这些口供时，窘态百出。
    在对被告的审讯结束后，检察官即起立发言。他指出这次公正的审讯，更加证实检举的各种犯罪事实确凿不误，他要求予间谍各犯以法律制裁，并应对掩护和指挥这一大间谍案的前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”所有外籍人员有所处置，以保护祖国安全。经过半小时的休息和评议后，三时正进行宣判，四时全案完毕。
