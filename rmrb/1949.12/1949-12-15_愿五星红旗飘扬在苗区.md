　　May the Five-Starred Red Flag Fly Over the Miao Region
　　Miao Youth Jīng Píng
　　My hometown is in the Guizhou mountains, where "no three miles are flat," the most densely populated area of ​​Miao compatriots. In the era of the Kuomintang reactionaries and past feudal dynasties, it was called "the land of the unsubdued Miao barbarians." When the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army marched 25,000 miles north to resist Japan in 1934, it passed through there, sowing the seeds of national friendship and leaving a deep impression on our Miao compatriots.
　　As the Red Army bravely broke through the Kuomintang bandit army's blockade along the way and was about to reach our hometown, the Kuomintang security team, retreating from the sentry posts, came to our village. In addition to looting and pillaging, and demanding food and supplies from the people, they also terrorized me, saying: "The 'Communist bandits' are not far from here. They hate you Miao people the most, and they will kill you as soon as they see you. Not only will they kill all of you, but they will also burn down the houses you live in..." At this time, although we did not fully believe their propaganda, we still had a sense of fear. Because every time the "Central Army" passed by in the past, they would inevitably seize men, levy grain, rape, and plunder, doing everything possible. We thought these facts were lessons and evidence that disaster would inevitably strike whenever there were troops passing through. So, we were terrified and didn't know what to do.
　　Of course, we live in the deep mountains, and we can only temporarily escape into the deep mountains to wait and see. We looked down from the top of the mountain, and the Red Army's队伍 looked like a long snake, winding and twisting, advancing like the endless Yangtze River.
　　After the 队伍 passed, we returned from the mountain. The first thing we saw when we got home was that the house was still intact and had not been burned down. Apart from the slogans "Down with the traitorous Kuomintang reactionaries" written on the walls, nothing else was damaged. Upon further inspection of the things left at home, everything was still there. At this time, everyone showed a happy smile and praised the Red Army's strict discipline in unison, and said regretfully: "The 'Central Army' speaks badly of them, but who knew they were a thousand times better than the 'Central Army'. Had we known this, why would we have run away!"
　　When the Red Army passed by, there was no one selling things for them to eat, so they had to go to the vegetable fields planted by our Miao compatriots to cut some vegetables to eat. However, they did not cut them for free, they paid for each one they cut. They wrapped the silver coins in circulation at that time in paper and placed them on top of the cut vegetable roots. When we returned from the slope and discovered this situation in the vegetable field, we were just surprised and thought they were doing some kind of "trick" here. When we opened the paper package and saw the white silver dollars, we knew that the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which loved the working people, observed mass discipline so well that they even paid for eating a little vegetable. When my elderly uncle came back and saw that his dozen or so geese were still there, he was moved and said very happily to us: "These geese are still alive and have not been eaten, which I really didn't expect. If it were the 'Central Army', I'm afraid I wouldn't even see them in my dreams." He gave a thumbs up: "These troops are really good. I've lived for fifty or sixty years and have seen many large troops, but I can't find one better than the Red Army."
　　In the village opposite our village, there was an old man in his fifties or sixties who had not escaped and stayed at home. One day, a Red Army soldier went to his house, and he thought things were going badly for him. But things turned out to be beyond his imagination. The soldier chatted with him very kindly. In the evening, the soldier brought a cadre to talk to the old man again, and told the old man very clearly: "We are detouring here to fight Japan. We are the people's army, and we are not like Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army that kills you and harms you. Whether you are Miao or Han, you are all Chinese, all one family. We should unite to fight Japan and protect our homeland..." He also told the old man some truths about national equality. Later, the old man told us: "He said a lot, and I couldn't understand some of it, so I can't remember it." The next day, when they were leaving, they even came to say goodbye to the old man!
　　These facts made us understand that such a good army had appeared in China, and it was as close to us Miao people as brothers. Whenever we were subjected to encirclement and suppression, "assimilation," oppression, exploitation, and enslavement by the reactionary government, we hoped that the Red Army, which had passed through this place, would come to rescue us so that we could live a free, equal, peaceful, happy, friendly, and harmonious life. We have always been yearning for it, and today, that day has finally arrived. We are jubilant and joyful, and we use happy songs to welcome its arrival. May the Five-Starred Red Flag forever fly over the sky of this land! Let its light forever illuminate our path forward!

　　愿五星红旗飘扬在苗区
    苗族青年  经平
    我的家乡在“地无三里平”的贵州山谷里，是苗族同胞分布最密的区域；那里在国民党反动派及历代封建王朝统治时代被称为“不服王化的苗蛮之邦”。当一九三四年中国工农红军二万五千里长征北上抗日的时候，曾由那里路过，在那地方散播了民族友爱的种子，给我们苗民同胞留下一个深刻的印象。
    在红军英勇地突破沿途截击的国民党匪军封锁线，而将到达我们家乡的前夕，由哨卡败退回来的国民党保安团队来到了我们的村里，他们除了抢劫掳掠，向老百姓要吃要用外，还大肆恐吓地向我说：“‘共匪’已经距这里不远了，他们最恨你们苗子，见一个就杀一个，不但要把你们的人杀光；而且还要把你们住的房子也烧光……。”这时候我们对他们这种宣传虽不十分相信，但毕竟是存在着一种畏惧的心理。因为以往的“中央军”每次过路时，都免不了要抓丁、派粮、奸淫、掳掠，无所不为。我们以为这些事实就是教训、就是殷证，凡是有军队过就必遭殃。于是，我们就恐惧地不知所措了。
    当然，我们是住在深山里，我们也只有暂时逃到深山里去，看看再说。我们在高山顶上俯视着山下，红军的队伍如长蛇般弯弯曲曲，象长江水滔滔不绝地前进。
    队伍过完了，我们才由山上回来，我们到家首先看到的是：房子依然原封原号的存在着，并没有烧掉；除了板壁上面写着“打倒卖国的国民党反动派”等标语以外，其余的一无破损。再进一步细检留在家里的东西，还是样样俱存。这时候大家都流露出愉快的微笑，异口同声的称赞红军纪律的严明，并且懊悔似的说：“‘中央军’讲他们坏，那晓得他们却比‘中央军’好上千百倍，早知这样我们何必逃跑！”
    当红军路过时，没有卖东西的给他们吃，于是他们不得不到我们苗胞种的菜田里去割一些菜来吃，但是，他们不是空割，割一棵有一棵的价钱。他们把当时流通的银币用纸包好，放在割掉了的菜根上面。等到我们由坡上回来，到菜田里去发现这种情形的时候，我们只是惊奇，以为他们在这儿弄些什么“鬼名堂”了。待把纸包揭开是白色的银元时，我们知道了爱护劳动人民的工农红军，是那样的遵守群众纪律，连吃一点菜都要给钱。当我年老的伯伯回来看见他十几鹅还在时，他被感动了，非常高兴的对我们说：“这些鹅，还活着没有被吃掉，这真是我料想不到的事。假使是‘中央军’的话，恐怕我梦也梦不见它们了。”他伸出大拇指：“这些军队真好，我活这五六十年来，见过的大队虽然不少，但再也找不出一个比红军好。”
    在我们村的对门寨，有一个没逃的五六十岁的老人，留在家里。有一天，一位红军战士到他家里去，他以为这可糟了。但事情却出于他的想象之外，这位战士很和蔼的与他攀谈起来了。晚上，这位战士带了一位干部又来和老人谈，很清楚的告诉老人说：“我们是由这边绕道去打日本的，我们是人民的军队，我们不象蒋介石反动派的军队那样杀你们、害你们。不管苗人、汉人都是中国人，都是一家人，我们应该联合起来打日本保家乡……。”他还和老人讲些民族平等的道理。后来老人告诉我们说：“他讲的很多，有一些我都懂不得，所以记不起来了。”第二天临走的时候，他们还来向老头告别呢！
    在这些事实的教育下，使我们明白了中国出现了这样一个好的军队，它和我们苗人正如兄弟一样的亲密。每当我们受到反动政府的进剿、“同化”、压榨、剥削、奴役，重重迫害着的时候，我们就希望曾由这地方经过的红军来拯救我们，使我们能够过着自由、平等、和平、幸福、友爱、和睦的生活。我们始终在渴望着，直到今天，这日子终于来到了，我们欢腾、喜悦，我们用快乐的歌声来迎接它的来临，愿五星红旗永远飘扬在我们这块土地的上空！让她的光明永远照耀着我们前进！
