Beijing Radio Russian Lecture Series
  Registration Begins Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association and the Second Program of the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station are jointly organizing a Russian language lecture series on the radio, scheduled to begin on the 5th. Registration begins today (the 1st). Anyone wishing to participate in the study can register from the 1st to the 10th through the Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association organization in their respective work units, or directly at the Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association located at 2 Yuhe Bridge. Participants can choose between group study and individual study. Those in the same agency, factory, school, or residential area can form study groups of ten or fewer people, and three or more study groups can combine to form a study class, with each selecting a person in charge. Those participating in group study can purchase lecture notes at a 30% discount from the 50's Publishing House on Chongnei Avenue, starting from the 2nd, upon presentation of their registration certificate. They can also request priority in having their questions answered by the teacher, and, if necessary, with the teacher's consent obtained through the Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association, have their questions answered in person. Individual learners who wish to participate in group study can be introduced by the Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association to nearby study groups. Individual learners can purchase lecture notes at a 20% discount from the 50's Publishing House, starting from the 2nd, upon presentation of their registration certificate. (The following bookstores also sell lecture notes, but without discounts: Xinhua Bookstore on Wangfujing Street, Sanlian Bookstore, Workers' Publishing House at Dongdan Archway, Beijing Liberation Bookstore at Dongsi Archway, Lianying Bookstore at Xidan Archway, Dazhong Bookstore at Xisi Archway, Xinhua Bookstore on Qianmenwai Street, Hongguang Bookstore on Houmen Street.) Regular exams will be held during the course. The teacher will set the questions through the radio, and after the exams, the teacher will broadcast the standard answer sheet. Each study group leader can evaluate the results based on the standard answer sheet and report the results to the Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association. The study content will start from pronunciation, based on the vocabulary of the workers' literacy textbooks, with lecture notes compiled by the teacher. It is estimated that one thousand words and basic grammar can be taught within a year. Study time is divided into morning and evening classes. The evening class is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, and the morning class is held every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM. Anyone who has opinions on the study content or methods is welcome to send them to the Beijing-Soviet Friendship Association at 2 Yuhe Bridge or the Second Program of the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station on West Chang'an Street at any time.
