    [Our Dispatch] The North China People's Revolutionary University has formed a cadre spare-time Russian language study class, with more than 400 participants. The plan is to study in three stages, tentatively set at three months per stage. The first stage of teaching materials selects the Russian Reader published by the Shanghai Shidai (Epoch) Publishing House, studying 22 lessons from it. The second stage selects an intermediate Russian Reader, studying 24 lessons, with the intention of teaching one lesson each time (one and a half hours), including grammar. The third stage selects scattered articles such as the History of the CPSU(B) Short Course, Problems of Leninism, and Pravda, etc. The initial week of pronunciation and alphabet learning is not included, with exercises once a week. After nine months of study, the requirement is to achieve a level where generally, one can read ordinary newspapers, magazines, books, and translate from Russian to Chinese. At 5 PM on the 25th, the Academic Affairs Office specially convened a gathering of all cadres studying Russian to announce the teaching methods and guidelines. It was decided that classes would officially begin on the 28th. (Revolutionary University Communications Group)
