　　The Patriotic Upsurge of Hong Kong Compatriots
　　Wu Weizi
　　Starting with the celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the liberation of Guangzhou, Hong Kong compatriots have launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic upsurge of the patriotic movement.
　　In the second half of October, Hong Kong workers held more than 40 celebration and troop-supporting rallies. The rooftop of the Federation of Trade Unions was brightly lit for a week, and was crowded with two to three thousand people every night. People cheered "Long live Chairman Mao" again and again, and challenged each other to donate funds for the troops. Rubber workers proposed that each person donate a pair of shoes, and Kowloon motorcycle workers proposed collectively donating vehicles; the Women's Textile Workers' Union donated more funds in one evening than they had raised in a month for their union's founding expenses, the Seamen's Union called for the donation of five thousand towels, and also spread the donation book to every corner of the world where Hong Kong seamen set foot… Similar enthusiastic gatherings and donations quickly spread to the youth, women, cultural, educational, and business circles. And they quickly came together under the call of a great goal.
　　The Hong Kong and Kowloon All Circles Troop Support Preparatory Committee was established. They stipulated that November would be the troop support month for all Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, and the troop support work entered a new high tide. News of troop support donations filled most of the newspaper pages. The Federation of Trade Unions called on all workers to launch a "one person, one item" movement, and in less than twenty days, they collected more than HK$18,000 in addition to in-kind donations. In the same week, the youth's troop support donation exceeded HK$20,000. The women's initial goal was HK$20,000 in cash and 1,000 cotton-padded clothes. This goal has been achieved ahead of schedule, and the second phase of raising HK$10,000 in cash and 1,000 comfort bags has begun immediately. The Ta Kung Pao's record of donations received was HK$80,000 on the 16th, nearly HK$90,000 on the 18th, and exceeded HK$100,000 on the 21st. The education and business circles jointly held a fete, and the various items collected filled two large buildings, with a total value of more than HK$40,000, and were sold for HK$40,000 within two days. The youth circles held song and dance galas for several consecutive days, the art circles held art exhibitions, and newspapers, bookstores, and cinemas held charity sales and performances. The preparatory committee also gathered more than 200 artists to perform an unprecedentedly grand carnival, and the music circles will also hold a large-scale performance. Metal workers fasted for a week and donated more than 1,000 yuan.
　　After a foreign affairs worker initiated a long-term troop support by donating one day's salary each month, a group of workers publicly responded the next day. The call for long-term donations for troop support also quickly spread among people from all walks of life. Some people wrote to the newspaper saying that they would donate monthly until Chongqing was liberated, and some said they would donate until Taiwan was taken. The faculty and staff of democratic schools generally donated more than 20% of their salaries, and the students of one school recognized and donated more than 30,000 yuan in the challenge. Fifteen shoe-shining children, unwilling to lag behind in patriotism, jointly sent five yuan, half a day's labor income, to Ta Kung Pao. Someone bought a small national flag for fifteen yuan at a charity sale. A worker took out his father's only inheritance, a leather coat, for charity sale, an unemployed woman pawned a set of clothes and also scrambled to donate five yuan, and another female worker only donated 50 cents, but this was all the wages she had accumulated after working ten hours a day, taking time out of her rest time for a week to help people paste paper bags.
　　That's how, by the end of the month, the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency had received more than 180,000 yuan in cash, and it is estimated that a large portion has not yet been paid in full. In addition to cash, the comfort goods raised by various units have filled more than a dozen warehouses.
　　The great achievement of the troop support movement marks the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots' enthusiastic support for the new China—the People's Republic of China. The scale of the troop support movement is unprecedented. Almost all of the Hong Kong working class has been involved in this movement; a total of more than 80 units participated in the troop support movement, and even the teachers and students of Hong Kong British government's official schools, regardless of the school authorities' obstruction, stepped into the ranks of the movement. It is estimated that at least 200,000 people were directly involved in this troop support wave.
　　Accompanying this raging patriotic fervor was the successive uprising of the employees of the Central and China Airlines and the former Resources Committee. Their uprising was welcomed by Hong Kong compatriots, and letters and telegrams of condolences flew like snowflakes, strengthening the confidence of the insurgents and encouraging their courage.
　　The patriotic movement of Hong Kong compatriots has been subjected to various obstructions by the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government's announcement that more than 30 groups were illegal organizations and the cessation of their activities is one example of this obstructive action. But the upsurge of the patriotic movement cannot be stopped, and the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have decided to strengthen unity and continue to do a good job in troop support as a reply to all kinds of obstructionist atrocities.

　　香港同胞的爱国热潮
    邬维梓
    以庆祝中华人民共和国成立和广州解放为起点，香港同胞卷起了一个空前热烈的爱国运动的高潮。
    十月下半月，香港的工人曾分别举行了四十多次祝捷劳军大会。职工联合会的天台，连续一星期灯光如昼，每晚都挤满二、三千人。人们一次又一次地在欢呼毛主席万岁，此起彼应地进行着劳军捐款的挑战。橡胶工人提出每个人捐鞋一对，九龙摩托车工人提出集体捐车；妇女纺织工会在一个晚上捐到的款项比她们奔走一个月筹得的建会费还多，海员工会号召捐五千条毛巾，还要将捐册散布到香港海员足迹所至的世界每一角落……。同样热烈的集会和捐输，很快就遍及青年界、妇女界、文化界、教育界和工商界。而且他们很快就在一个伟大的目标号召下紧密地靠拢起来。
    港九各界劳军筹委会成立了。他们规定了十一月为全港九同胞的劳军月，劳军工作从此进入一个新的高潮，劳军捐献的消息占满了报纸的大部篇幅。工联会号召全体工人展开一人一物运动，除实物外，在不到二十天的日子里就捐集了港币一万八千余元。同一星期间青年界的劳军献金已经突破了二万元。妇女界第一期目标为二万元现款、千件棉衣，这个目标已提早实现，并且立即又开始了第二期一万元现款、一千个慰劳袋的筹募。大公报代收捐款的纪录，十六日八万元，十八日近九万元二十一日就突破十万元。教育界和工商界联合举办卖物会，募集到的各种物品，摆满了两层大楼，总值四万余元，两日之内就卖到了四万元。青年界连续几天举行歌舞大会，美术界举行画展，报刊、书店和影院纷纷义卖、义演。筹委会还集结了二百多名艺人演出空前盛大的游艺会，音乐界也将举行大规模的演奏。五金工人进行一周节食，捐献出一千余元。
    一个洋务工友发起每月捐薪一日长期劳军后，第二日就有一群工友公开响应。长期捐献劳军的呼声也在各界人士中迅速展开。有的人致函报馆说，他们要按月捐献直到重庆解放，有的人说要捐到打下台湾。民主学校的教职员普遍捐薪百分之二十以上，一家学校的学生在挑战中认捐了三万余元。十五个擦鞋小童爱国不甘人，联名将半天劳力所得五元送交大公报。有人在义卖会上以十五元买一面小国旗。一个工人将父亲唯一的遗产一件皮大衣拿出来义卖，一个失业女工押出一套衣服也争着捐出五元，另一个女工只捐了五角钱，但这是她在每天十小时工作后，连续一星期抽出工余休息时间替人贴纸袋积起来的全部工资。
    就是这样，才到月底，香港新华分社已收到现款十八万余元，估计还有很大部分尚未交齐。除现款外，各单位募到的慰劳品已经堆满了十几个仓库。
    劳军运动的巨大成绩，标志着港九同胞对于新中国—中华人民共和国的热忱拥护。劳军运动的规模是空前的。香港工人阶级几乎全部都已经卷进这一运动；参加劳军运动的团体共达八十几个单位，甚至香港英国政府的官立学校员生也不顾学校当局的阻挠，大步走进运动的行列。直接卷入这次劳军浪潮的估计至少有二十万人。
    和这如火如荼的爱国热潮相伴而来的是中央、中国两个航空公司和前资源委员会的员工们的相继起义。他们的起义受到香港同胞的欢迎，慰问函电有如雪片纷飞，加强了起义人员的信心，鼓舞了他们的勇气。
    香港同胞的爱国运动受到了香港政府的种种阻挠。香港政府宣布三十余团体为非法组织，并停止其活动，就是这种阻挠行动之一例。但爱国运动的热潮是阻止不了的，香港的爱国同胞决定以加强团结、继续做好劳军工作，作为种种阻挠暴行的答复。
