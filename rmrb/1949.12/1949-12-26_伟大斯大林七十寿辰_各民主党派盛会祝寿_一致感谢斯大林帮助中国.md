　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, among other democratic parties, held a grand celebration at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 PM on the 22nd to celebrate the 70th birthday of the world's revolutionary leader and mentor, Marshal Stalin. Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government Zhu De and Liu Shaoqi, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Lin Boqu, Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Guo Moruo, Mayor of Beijing Nie Rongzhen, Soviet Ambassador to China Counselor Vaskov, leading figures from various ministries and commissions of our Central Government, leaders of various people's organizations, central committee members of various democratic parties in Beijing, and guests from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, totaling over 400 people, were invited to attend. The hosts, including Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zemin, Ma Xulun, and Xu Deheng, personally greeted the guests. A portrait of Marshal Stalin, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, and a satin banner with the character "寿" (longevity) were hung high at the front of the venue; four pairs of candles were placed in front of the longevity banner, with a large peach-shaped birthday cake in the center, filling the entire venue with a joyous atmosphere.
　　
    After the start of the evening party, the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, and Li Jishen delivered the opening speech. He said: The victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause is inextricably linked with the great name of Stalin. The forces of the world striving for national liberation, people's democracy, and lasting peace are all gathered around this giant, Stalin, and these struggles can only advance victoriously under the guidance of this torch, Stalin. Li Jishen said: In the bright and glorious Moscow, our leader Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin are shaking hands and rejoicing. This historic meeting of the leaders of the two great nations signifies the deepening of brotherly friendship between the two countries, the strengthening of the world's peace and democracy camp, and symbolizes the development of world brightness and human happiness.
　　
    Then, Shen Junru delivered a birthday speech on behalf of the democratic parties, and Lin Boqu and Vaskov delivered speeches as guests. Shen Junru praised Stalin with enthusiastic words, saying: Your banner is the banner of victory, and the great victory and great transformation of our Chinese people are inseparable from your friendship and help. We thank you, you are always our greatest friend. We want to assure you that we will unite all the Chinese people and move towards the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, thoroughly crush the war-mongers' conspiracies, and strive for lasting world peace and the great cause of building a new democratic China.
　　
    Lin Boqu said: "The October Revolution was like a cannon shot, giving the Chinese people's liberation cause a new direction and new methods. This is the combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong Thought, which is New Democracy. All of this was learned from the enlightenment of the October Revolution and the successful socialist construction of the Soviet Union." Lin Boqu said: "To celebrate Stalin's birthday, we must cherish the enlightenment and help that Stalin has given to the Chinese people, we must learn from the Soviet Union's revolutionary and construction experience led by Stalin, and we must learn from the internationalist spirit of Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party, learning to help each other and fight together, regardless of nationality, against imperialism, against national oppression, and the spirit of unity between the proletariat and all working people. To celebrate Stalin's birthday, we must further consolidate and expand the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, further consolidate and develop the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, and oppose all rumors and 'secretly malicious' conspiracies that undermine Sino-Soviet friendship and undermine the People's Democratic United Front."
　　
    Vaskov said: With Stalin, the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world are growing stronger and stronger, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China is the most glorious example. For all people, the name of Stalin is a symbol of the victory of light over darkness and reactionary forces.
　　
    After the speeches, the whole audience stood up and cheered: "Long live Stalin!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" "Long live Stalin! Long live! Long, long live!" The applause was thunderous and lasted for a long time. Then, the birthday cake presentation ceremony was held, with Mrs. Chikhvinsky cutting the cake, and the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union again. The evening party did not end until 12 o'clock.

　　伟大斯大林七十寿辰
　  各民主党派盛会祝寿
　  一致感谢斯大林帮助中国
    【新华社北京二十五日电】中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、中国农工民主党、中国民主促进会、中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟等民主党派，为庆祝世界革命领袖和导师斯大林大元帅七十寿辰，于二十二日下午七时在北京饭店举行盛大庆祝晚会。应邀到会者有中央人民政府副主席朱德、刘少奇，中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，政务院总理周恩来，副总理郭沫若，北京市市长聂荣臻、苏联驻华大使馆参事华司高，暨我中央政府各部会军政首长，各人民团体领袖，各民主党派在京中央委员，苏联及新民主主义国家之来宾共四百余人。主人方面由李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、彭泽民、马叙伦、许德珩等亲任招待。会场正面高悬斯大林大元帅肖像，中苏两国国旗及大寿字缎幅；寿字缎幅之前分列蜡炬四对，正中陈放着斗大的寿桃，整个会场洋溢着欢愉的气氛。
    晚会开始后，乐队奏中苏两国国歌，李济深致开幕词。他说：中国人民解放事业的胜利是与斯大林这伟大的名字不可分地联结着的。全世界争取民族解放、人民民主、持久和平斗争的力量都集结在斯大林这巨人的周围，这些斗争也只有在斯大林这火炬照引之下才能胜利前进。李济深说：在光明辉煌的莫斯科，我们的领袖毛主席和斯大林大元帅正在握手言欢。这两大国家领袖的历史性的会晤，说明着两国间兄弟友爱的加深，世界和平民主阵营的加强，象征着世界光明和人类幸福的发展。
    接着由沈钧儒代表各民主党派致祝寿词，来宾林伯渠、华司高致词。沈钧儒以热烈的语句称颂着斯大林，他说：你的旗帜就是胜利的旗帜，我们中国人民的大胜利、大翻身是和你的友情与帮助分不开的。我们的感谢你，你始终是我们最伟大的友人。我们要向你提出保证，就是我们一定团结全中国人民，走向以苏联为首的国际民主阵营，彻底粉碎战争贩子的阴谋，为争取世界的持久和平和建设新民主主义中国的伟大事业而斗争。
    林伯渠说：“十月革命一声炮响，中国人民的翻身事业，就得到新的方向，就有了办法。这就是马克思主义的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，就是新民主主义。这都是从十月革命的启示，从苏联社会主义建设成功中学来的。”林伯渠说：“我们庆祝斯大林的寿辰，就要珍贵斯大林所给予中国人民的启示和帮助，就要学习斯大林所领导的苏联革命经验和建设经验，更要学习斯大林和苏联共产党的国际主义精神，学习不问国别和民族，互相援助，共同奋斗，反对帝国主义，反对民族压迫，无产阶级和一切劳动人民联合起来的精神。我们庆祝斯大林的寿辰，要更加巩固和扩大中苏人民的友谊，要更加巩固和发展中国人民民主统一战线，要反对一切破坏中苏友谊破坏人民民主统一战线的造谣和‘口密腹剑’的阴谋行为。”
    华司高说：有了斯大林，全世界的和平民主的力量便一天一天地增长而且强固起来，中华人民共和国的建立就是最光辉的例子。斯大林的名字，对于所有的人们，是光明战胜黑暗和反动势力的象征。
    讲演毕，全场起立欢呼：“斯大林万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中苏友好万岁！”“斯大林万岁！万岁！万万岁！”掌声雷动，经久不息。接着举行献寿糕仪式，由齐赫文斯基夫人切寿糕，乐队再奏中苏两国国歌。晚会直至十二时始散。
