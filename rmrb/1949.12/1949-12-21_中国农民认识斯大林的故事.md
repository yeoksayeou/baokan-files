　　The Story of Chinese Peasants Getting to Know Stalin
　　Wu Yun
　　　　　Mao Zedong's Teacher
　　In the winter of 1946, I was sent to a village in Wu'an County, Taihang District, to help peasants carry out land reform.
　　In mobilizing the peasants to struggle for land distribution, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions in our work. We first paid attention to firmly relying on the poor peasants and firmly uniting the middle peasants. This was the fundamental line of the Party in the land revolution, which Chairman Mao had already expounded in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan."
　　For thousands of years, the poor Chinese peasants had lived a tragic life under the evil rule of the feudal system. Now, there was finally a leader who could lead them towards true liberation and a happy path. The peasants were so grateful and loving to their own leader, Chairman Mao. The poor peasant comrade I stayed with was like that. He told me that in feudal society, he tilled the land for the landlord, and his wife worked for the master. They worked day and night for the landlord but still could not support themselves and their children. But the landlord came up with a clever plan, forcing his wife to abandon a child she had just given birth to, for fear that she would not be able to do more work for the master if she was with the child. They tearfully wanted to throw their own baby into the river. They couldn't do that, so they secretly placed the child at the door of a family, hoping that the head of the family was kind and could preserve the child's life. This is a portrayal of the life of Chinese peasants in feudal society. But after the Communist Party came, this poor peasant redeemed the child he had abandoned three or four years ago at a low price. How grateful they were to Chairman Mao!
　　Therefore, this poor peasant comrade was so concerned and happy to listen to me talk about Chairman Mao. He always liked to ask questions, asking if I had met Chairman Mao, what Chairman Mao looked like, what his voice sounded like, how old he was, and whether he was healthy. When I told him all this, he was extremely happy. But he also said, "He's over fifty years old and still worrying so much about the people. The people are really worried about him. I think he should rest more and do less work, but I'm afraid that's impossible!" Another time, we were chatting with several peasants and talking about Chairman Mao. He suddenly asked me, "Does Chairman Mao have a teacher? How did he learn all his skills?" I thought for a moment and replied, Chairman Mao has teachers: that is, our people, and also Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. Everyone asked me what was going on. I said: For example, Chairman Mao's land reform method was learned from these teachers. More than ten years ago, Chairman Mao led the peasants to distribute land and learned a lot of experience from the peasants. More than twenty years ago, Soviet peasants under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin also solved their land problems. Chairman Mao also learned from the Soviet experience. Now Lenin is dead, but Stalin is still alive. Everyone was very happy to hear this. They all wanted me to tell them the story of Chairman Mao's teacher—Stalin. Asking if he was the same kind of person as Chairman Mao? I said: Stalin is the leader of the people of the world, leading the workers and peasants of the world in revolution. A peasant nodded and said: "Ah, Stalin is the big boss of our people all over the world in making revolution, right?" I quickly clapped my hands and shouted several "Yes, yes, yes." Everyone immediately understood that this teacher of Chairman Mao was their great leader, and they were as concerned about Stalin as they were about Chairman Mao. Everyone was particularly concerned about "He is almost seventy years old, and he still has to do so much work, how can he do it?" I told everyone that although this was the case, I heard that Stalin was still very healthy. Everyone said: "This is Stalin's blessing, and also the blessing of the people all over the world." They linked Stalin, Chairman Mao, and themselves together.
　　　　　Stalin Leads the Way in the Front
　　By the end of the year, the peasants in this village had completed land reform, and the villagers held several days of carnival and celebration. At the celebration, people were filled with infinite excitement. Young men and women were singing: "The Communist Party is here, and good times have come!" "With Chairman Mao, the peasants have turned over!" The elderly were also chanting the same phrases. Everyone shouted in unison "The people want to follow Chairman Mao!" But how to follow Chairman Mao, and where to go? After the meeting, some people asked this question, and everyone had different opinions. Some said, "Chairman Mao tells us where to go, and we will go there." Most people disagreed with such a general answer to the question. So someone said: "Chairman Mao calls on us to organize and develop production after we have turned over, so following Chairman Mao means responding to his call to produce well." Others said, "It is to help the front win victories, to expand the People's Liberation Army..." Later, that poor peasant comrade asked me: "Tell me, what does it really mean to follow Chairman Mao?" I said, what everyone said is correct. Chairman Mao wants us to turn over and organize mutual aid to develop production well. He said that this is the second revolution. But Chairman Mao also said that if our peasants want to truly live a good life and our children and grandchildren will no longer suffer poverty and oppression, we must follow the path that Stalin led the Soviet peasants on, that is, we must create a socialist society. Everyone then wanted me to talk about what kind of path Stalin led the Soviet peasants on. I told them how the Soviet peasants built collective farms after the success of the revolution, eliminated poverty, fought against disasters, droughts, and poor harvests, cultivated land with machines, sowed seeds by airplanes, and the peasants' income increased year by year, and their lives became richer day by day. Everyone listened as if they were listening to a legendary story, and they couldn't help but ask themselves: "When can we reach that society?" "It would be great to be in that society. Life would be meaningful." At this time, they seemed to see Chairman Mao guiding them forward, and Stalin leading the way at the forefront of the ranks of human progress. After the liberation, a dozen peasants in the village were approved to join the Party. They changed from ordinary peasants to soldiers of Stalin and Mao Zedong, which illustrates this point.
　　Thousands upon thousands of Chinese peasants have come to know Stalin through Chairman Mao, and they recognize that Stalin and the country he leads—the Soviet Union—are closely related to their fate. Chinese peasants care about the Soviet Union and Stalin as much as they care about China and Chairman Mao.

### 中国农民认识斯大林的故事

　　中国农民认识斯大林的故事
    吴云
  　　　　　毛主席的先生
    在一九四六年冬天，我被派到太行区武安县一个村，帮助农民进行土地改革。
    在发动农民分土地的斗争中，我们遵循着毛主席的指示进行工作。我们首先注意到的就是紧紧依靠贫农，并牢固地团结中农。这是在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中，毛主席就已阐明过了的党在土地革命中的根本路线。
    几千年来，中国的贫苦农民，在封建制度的罪恶统治下，过着极悲惨的生活，现在，居然有这么一个领袖，能领导他们走向真正解放和幸福的道路。农民对于这位自己的领袖——毛主席是那样的感激与热爱。我住在他家的那位贫农同志就是这样。他告诉我说：在封建社会，他替地主种地，他的女人替主人作工，他们为地主白间黑夜的劳动，还不能养活自己和孩子。可是地主又生出巧计，逼迫着要他的女人把生下不久的一个孩子抛弃，为的怕她带着小孩不能替主人作更多的工作。他们吞着眼泪要把亲生的婴儿丢入河里。他们不能这样作，终于偷偷地把孩子安放在一家人的门口，希望这家主人是善良的，能够保留下这个孩子的生命。这是封建社会里中国农民生活的写照。但共产党过来之后，这个贫农，低价赎回扔掉三四年的孩子。他们对毛主席是如何的感激！
    所以，这位贫农同志，也就那样关心和高兴地，听我讲说毛主席的事，他总是喜欢问长问短，问我见过毛主席没有？毛主席长的什么样？说话的声音又怎么样？有多大岁数了？身体好不好？……当我告诉他所有这些时，他快乐极了。但他又说：“五十多岁的人了。还整天替老百姓操那样大的心，老百姓才真替他操心哩，依我说，他应该多休息，少做事，但是怕办不到吧？！”又有一次，我们和好几个农民在一起谈天，谈到毛主席，他忽然问我：“毛主席有先生没有，他的本事都是怎么学来的？”我考虑了一下，回答他说：毛主席有先生：那就是咱们老百姓，还有马克思、列宁和斯大林。大家问我是怎么一回事。我说：好比毛主席的土地改革办法，就是从这几位先生那里学来的。十多年前，毛主席就领导过农民分土地，跟农民学了许多经验，二十多年前，苏联农民有列宁、斯大林领导下也解决过他们的土地问题，毛主席也学了苏联的经验。现在列宁死了，但斯大林还活着。大家听了很高兴。都要我讲讲毛主席的先生——斯大林的故事。问他是不是和毛主席一样的人？我说：斯大林是世界人民的领袖，领导世界工人农民闹革命的。有个农民点着头说：“啊，斯大林，就是咱们全世界人民闹革命的大头儿，对吗？”我连忙拍手叫了好几个“对，对，对。”大家马上懂得了这位毛主席的先生是他们的伟大领袖，他们对斯大林的关心，也象关心毛主席一样。大家特别关心的也是“他老人家快七十岁了，还要做那么多的工作，怎么行呢？”我告诉大家说：虽然这样，但听说斯大林的身体还很健壮。大家就都说：“这是斯大林的福气，也是全世界老百姓的福气。”他们把斯大林、毛主席和自己联结在一起了。
    　　　　斯大林在最前面带路
    到年底的时候，这个村子的农民完成了土地改革，村里的人举行了好几天的狂欢和庆祝。在庆祝会上，人们洋溢着无限兴奋的心情，青年男女在唱着：“来了共产党，来了好时光！”“有了毛主席，农民翻了身！”老年人也在念着同样的词句。大家都异口同声喊出“老百姓要随着毛主席走！”但是怎样随毛主席走，走到那里去呢？会后就有人这样问，这个问题大家就有各种不同的看法。有的说，毛主席叫往那儿走咱就往那儿走，多数人不同意这样笼统地回答问题。于是有人就说：毛主席号召我们，翻身以后要组织起来发展生产，所以跟毛主席走就是要响应他的号召好好生产。也有的说，就是要帮助前方打胜仗，就是要扩大人民解放军……后来，那位贫农同志就问我：“你说，到底怎么就叫跟毛主席走？”我说，大家说的没有错，毛主席要我们翻了身，好好组织互助发展生产，他说这是第二个革命。但是毛主席还说，咱们农民要真正过好日子，子子孙孙不再受穷苦受压迫，一定要走斯大林领导苏联农民走过的路，就是还得闹个社会主义社会出来才行。大家于是就要我说说斯大林领导苏联农民走过的路是怎样的？我就告诉他们，苏联农民在革命成功以后，怎样建设集体农庄，消灭贫困，和灾旱歉收作斗争，用机器耕地，飞机播种，农民的收入一年比一年增多，生活一天比一天富裕。……大家象听传奇故事似的入了神，都不自禁地问自己说：“我们什么时候就能走到那个社会呢？”“到那个社会就好了，人活着一辈子也就有了意思了。”这时他们好象看见毛主席在前面指引着他们前进，在人类进步行列的最前头还有斯大林在带着路。翻身以后，村里有十几个农民被批准入了党，他们从一个普通的农民变为斯大林毛泽东的战士，就是说明了这一点。
    中国千千万万农民经过毛主席认识了斯大林，认识了斯大林和他所领导的国家——苏联与他们的命运休戚相关。中国农民关心着苏联和斯大林，犹如关心着中国和毛主席一样。
