Stalin, in his summary of the achievements of cultural and educational work at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), already pointed out: "As a result of all this large-scale cultural work, a large number of new Soviet intellectuals have been born and formed in our country, who come from the working class, peasants, and Soviet staff, are flesh and blood with our people, know nothing about the yoke of the exploiting system, hate the exploiters, and are determined to loyally serve the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union."

Kaftanov said: The Soviet Union is unparalleled in the scale of training intellectual cadres. The number of experts and specialized personnel being trained in the Soviet Union is more than the total of all Eurasian countries. The number of students receiving higher education in Moscow alone exceeds the number of such students in the entire United Kingdom or France. Ten years ago, Stalin said that we should make all workers and peasants into cultured and educated people. Stalin's words have been realized. There are now many outstanding Stakhanovite workers and outstanding collective farmers who are extraordinary pioneers in industry and agriculture. People can see them on the podiums of higher education institutions or research institutes, telling about their work experience and practice.

Kaftanov said in conclusion: The entire Soviet people have become highly cultured and educated people, and they have already begun to live a brilliant and happy life. People can see the achievements of Soviet culture from the example of any republic in the Soviet Union. All republics have their own schools, colleges, universities, hundreds of research laboratories, clubs, and theaters. These institutions, born out of the cultural revolution, meet the needs and interests of the Soviet people, and they are marching towards communism under the wise leadership of the great Stalin.

　　苏联培养中的专家人材比欧亚各国的总和还多
    斯大林在苏联共产党（布）第十八届代表大会上总结文化与教育工作的成就时就已指出：“由于这一切大规模的文化工作的结果，在我国诞生和形成了人数众多的新的苏维埃的知识分子，他们都是从工人阶级、农民和苏维埃职员中间出身，与我国人民血肉相连，根本不知剥削制的羁轭为何物，仇恨剥削者，并决计忠诚服务于苏联各族人民的。”
    卡夫坦诺夫说：苏联在培养知识分子干部的规模上是举世无匹的。苏联正在培养中的专家与专门人材的数目，较欧亚各国的总和还要多。仅仅是莫斯科受高等教育的学生，就超过了英国全国或法国全国的同等学生。十年前斯大林就说过，我们要使得一切工人和农民都变成有文化有教养的人。斯大林的话已经实现了。现在已经有许多优秀的斯塔哈诺夫式的工人和优秀的集体农民，他们是工业与农业的非凡的开路先锋。人们可以看到他们在高等教育机关或研究院的讲坛上，讲述他们的工作经验和实践的情形。
    卡夫坦诺夫在结语中说：苏联全体人民都已经变成有高度文化、高度教养的人民，他们业已开始过着灿烂的幸福生活。人们可以从苏联任何一个共和国的例子看出苏维埃文化的成就。所有的共和国都有它们自己的学校、学院、大学、成百所研究实验室、俱乐部和戏院等。由于文化革命而产生的这些机关，是符合苏联人民的要求和利益的，他们正在伟大斯大林英明的领导下向共产主义迈进。
