Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: Yesterday morning, Lips Adinknot, the representative of Dutch women, spoke to the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Excerpts are as follows:

　　I want to talk about the impact of the war in Indonesia on the working people of our country, and what Dutch women have done to support their Indonesian sisters in their struggle for freedom and independence.

　　The war waged by the reactionary Dutch government against the Indonesian people is very costly, with 51 percent of the national budget being used for war purposes. The war not only lowered the people's living standards and directly affected the economic situation of the Dutch working class, but also brought great suffering to the families of the Indonesian and Dutch people. Every month, ships returning to the Netherlands carried many wounded soldiers, who would be crippled for life. Every week, newspapers published lists of fallen soldiers. All of this has caused great unease in the hearts of Dutch women and mothers. Dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's colonial policy is spreading to an increasingly large group of people. When troop transport ships leave the docks, demonstrations are held. More than 3,000 people participated in the demonstration in the Dutch port of Ijmuiden. Banners and leaflets explained the nature of the war to the soldiers, with slogans such as "We want houses, not barracks" and "Bring our troops back from Indonesia." Dutch women often play an important role in these demonstrations, always taking the lead.

　　This year, the parents, wives, sisters, and children of soldiers who have served in Indonesia for more than two years have formed an organization that demands that these soldiers be demobilized immediately upon their return to the Netherlands. The Dutch women's movement strongly supports the demands of this organization. Protest rallies against the war of aggression in Indonesia have been held in many cities and villages in the Netherlands. The Dutch women's movement organization has visited four major trade unions, urging them to push the government to withdraw our soldiers from Indonesia. We have distributed tens of millions of declarations and telegrams to the government and the United Nations Security Council.

　　As a result of all these activities, the resistance movement of the Dutch people and the soldiers in the Netherlands and Indonesia is flourishing, and tens of thousands of soldiers are refusing to fight in Indonesia. These soldiers are now imprisoned in jails and concentration camps.

　　Driven by the Dutch women's movement, a national committee has been organized to assist these soldiers, and a delegation has been sent to the War Department to protest the forced deportation of troops. Within a few days, we collected the signatures of tens of thousands of Dutch people for this protest. As a result of this action, only 161 soldiers boarded the ship.

　　We want to lead this movement and, together with other organizations, extend it to factories and people's homes.

　　Only through the strong union between the freedom-loving Indonesian and Dutch people, and supported by the unity of all democratic forces, can we achieve victory.

　　Helping the Indonesian people fight for national independence and people's democracy is the goal of the work of progressive forces in the Netherlands. Our duty is to strengthen our activities, especially to promote the movement to end the war. I would like to propose that this conference sponsor the liberation of Indonesian and Dutch soldiers, and provide them with international assistance.

　　Long live the unity between Asian women and democratic women in Asia and Europe in the struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and world peace!

　　荷兰妇女代表利普斯·阿丁诺特发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】昨日上午荷兰妇女的代表利普斯·阿丁诺特向亚洲妇女代表会议发言。兹摘录如下：
    我要讲一讲关于印度尼西亚的战争对我国劳动人民的影响，和荷兰妇女们已经做了些什么来支持她们的印度尼西亚姐妹们争取自由独立的斗争。
    荷兰反动政府对于印度尼西亚人民所进行的战争耗费很大，国家预算的百分之五十一是作为战争目的之用。战争不但降低了人民的生活水准，直接影响了荷兰工人阶级的经济状况，而且给印尼和荷兰人民的家庭带来了极大的痛苦。每月回到荷兰来的轮船，载来了许多伤兵，他们将一辈子成为残废。每星期报纸上登载许多阵亡士兵的名单。这一切的结果使荷兰妇女们和母亲们的心里发生极大的不安。对于荷兰政府殖民政策的不满情绪正蔓延到日益广大的人群中。军队运输舰离开码头的时候，人们即举行示威。三千人以上参加了荷兰伊美登港的示威。旗帜和传单向士兵们说明战争的性质，标语是“要房子、不要兵营”、“把我们的军队从印度尼西亚调回来”等。荷兰妇女在这些示威中常常扮演着重要角色，总是起着带头作用。
    今年，在印尼已服役过二年以上的士兵的父母、妻子、姐妹和儿女们成立了一个组织，这个组织要求这些士兵们回到荷兰时候立刻复员。荷兰妇女运动强有力地支持了这个组织的要求。反对侵略印尼的战争的抗议集会已在荷兰许多城市和村庄中举行过。荷兰妇女运动组织访问过四个大工会，要求它们力促政府从印尼调回我们的士兵，我们已散发了千万份宣言和电报给政府和联合国安全理事会。
    由于这一切活动的结果，荷兰人民和在荷兰与印尼的士兵们的抵抗运动正在蓬勃起来，成千成万的士兵们拒绝到印尼去作战。这些士兵们现在被监禁在牢狱里和集中营里。
    由于荷兰妇女运动的推动，一个全国委员会已组织起来，协助这些士兵们，曾经派代表团向作战部抗议强迫遣送军队。几天之内，我们曾为这个抗议收集到成千成万荷兰人民的签字。这个行动的结果，只有一百六十一名士兵上了船。
    我们要领导这个运动，并且与其他组织在一起把这个运动推广到各工厂和人民的家庭去。
    只有通过爱好自由的印尼人民和荷兰人民之间的坚强联合，并得到一切民主力量的团结所支持，我们才能获得胜利。
    帮助印度尼西亚人民争取民族独立、人民民主，就是荷兰进步力量工作的目标。我们的职责是加强我们的活动，尤其是推动结束战争的运动。我要提议这次会议，要赞助解放印度尼西亚和荷兰士兵的囚犯，并给他们以国际援助。
    在争取民族独立、人民民主与世界和平的斗争中，亚洲妇女与亚欧各民主妇女之间的联合万岁！
