Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 279th. Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 25th: "Voice of Vietnam" broadcast in French on the 24th New Year greetings from President Ho Chi Minh to the French people. The full broadcast is as follows:

　　"Dear friends, you know that French colonialists, driven by base interests, have been waging a criminal war against our people for four years. They have committed and are committing terrible crimes in Vietnam. This criminal war has brought devastating destruction to Vietnam and has also caused all kinds of misfortune to the families of the French people. Thousands of your sons are killed or wounded on the battlefield every month. You have to take more than 100 billion francs from your income every year to invest in this hopeless war.

　　People of France! We know that you do not approve of this unjust war. We know that you long for peace. We also long for peace. Let us unite our forces and find a way to achieve this common goal. Strengthen the heroic actions you have been carrying out: demand an immediate end to the war, so that your young compatriots can return home. And on our side, we will launch a counter-offensive to drive the colonialist aggressors from our land.

　　The reactionary colonialism will be defeated, and our two peoples will be able to shake hands in an atmosphere of peace and brotherly friendship."

　　胡志明向法人民贺年
    号召共同击败殖民主义者让越法两国人民和平友爱
    【新华社北京二七九日电】越南通讯社北越二十五日讯：“越南之声”二十四日以法语广播胡志明主席致法国人民的新年祝贺。广播全文如下：
    “亲爱的朋友们，你们知道，为卑贱利益所驱使的法国殖民主义者，对我们人民已进行了四年罪恶的战争。他们在越南已经犯过而且正在犯着可怖的罪行。这个罪恶的战争给越南带来了毁灭性的破坏，同时也使法国人民的家庭遭遇种种不幸。数以千计的你们的儿子，每月在战场上死伤了。你们每年要从自己的收入中拿出一千余亿法郎投入这个没有希望的战争。
    法兰西的人民们！我们知道你们是不赞成这个非正义的战争的。我们知道你们热望和平。我们也渴望和平。让我们把力量联合起来，设法达成这个共同目标。加强你们一直在进行着的英勇行动：要求立即停止战争，你们的年青同胞就可以回到家乡。而在我们这方面，我们将发动反攻，把殖民主义侵略者从我们的国土上驱逐出去。
    反动的殖民主义将被击败，我们两国人民将能够在和平与兄弟般友爱的气氛中握手言欢。”
