　　Long Live Stalin!
  　A Record of the Asian Women's Representative Conference Celebrating Stalin's Birthday
    Chen Ji
    On the pink, Chinese-style signature book, were written the names of outstanding women representatives from more than twenty countries in Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Africa. The women representatives expressed a common sentiment and voice in different languages, congratulating Comrade Stalin, the best friend of all nations in the world and the great teacher of mankind, on his seventieth birthday. Ding Ling, the Chinese women's representative and famous Chinese writer, read out the telegram of the entire conference celebrating Stalin's birthday on behalf of the Presidium of the Asian Women's Representative Conference: "Dear Comrade Stalin: Because of the victory of socialism, we Asian women have seen the sun rise on our lives of suffering and enslavement... In you, we have experienced the greatness of a teacher of mankind... We will forever sing your praises, your brilliance shining far and wide on the road to the liberation of all nations." All the Asian women representatives looked at Ding Ling, who held the inch-thick signature book and handed it to Soviet representative Bafinovna, asking Bafinovna to pass it on to Stalin. At this time, people were recalling the great historical event of the October Socialist Revolution, led by Lenin and Stalin thirty-two years ago, in which the Russian people shook the world; at this time, people were praising Stalin's brilliant achievements over the past thirty-two years in tirelessly seeking liberation for the oppressed people of the world; at this time, people were shouting for people all over the world to unite around Stalin and defend lasting peace throughout the world.
    Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing hundreds of millions of Chinese women, shouted loudly: "Thank you! Comrade Stalin! You instructed us: to use armed people to oppose armed counter-revolution. The Chinese people accepted your instructions and won an unprecedented great victory." Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Li Dequan, and Xu Guangping led the Chinese representatives, holding high a huge, ten-foot-long red brocade banner, and walked to the rostrum. Cai Chang looked at the longevity god painted on the brocade banner, celebrating Stalin's long life. When the Chinese women representatives presented their birthday gifts to Stalin to the Soviet representatives, we saw the warm embrace of the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, we heard the cheers of the representatives in the audience again and again: "Long live Stalin! Urrrah Stalin!", and we saw the representatives of the colonial and semi-colonial countries rejoicing. Iranian representative Masin Farroki, next to the Soviet representative's seat, took the hand of the Indian representative and shouted repeatedly and forcefully, "Great Stalin!" From the mouth of the Socialist Labor Hero Ubaydullayeva, the sound of "Sta—lin!" was uttered, and the entire audience immediately echoed this sound, chanting rhythmically for three minutes in a row.
    The children from the Los Angeles Nursery, wearing clothes of the same color, held flowers and walked up to the representatives one after another. They stood on the seats of the conference presidium and placed a red silk cloth with the word "Longevity" written on it in front of one of the children in the middle. They sang songs following the applause; as soon as the singing stopped, they raised their small fists and shouted together, Long Live Stalin. They live in the victorious New China, and they will never suffer the fate of starvation of children in capitalist countries as the French guests said. When they handed their gifts for Stalin's birthday to Bafinovna, the representatives quickly held the children tightly in their arms, and they were proud of the happiness of these children. Ding Ling said: "Stalin! How happily even our children will express their indescribable gratitude to you. Great Stalin, because you are creating a cause of happiness for the next generation day and night."

　　祝斯大林万寿无疆
  　记亚洲妇女代表会议庆贺斯大林寿辰

    粉红色的中国式的签名簿上，写满了亚洲、欧洲、美洲、非洲二十多个国家优秀的妇女代表们的名字。妇女代表们以不同的文字表现了共同的心意和声音，她们祝贺世界上一切民族的最好的朋友和伟大的人类导师斯大林同志的七十大寿。中国妇女代表、中国名作家丁玲代表亚洲妇女代表会议主席团宣读大会全体代表庆祝斯大林寿辰的电文：“亲爱的斯大林同志：由于社会主义的胜利，我们亚洲妇女有如看到在我们苦痛和奴役的生活上，升起了太阳。……在你身上，我们体会到了一个人类导师的伟大，……我们要永远歌颂你的光辉长远的照耀着一切民族解放的道路。”全亚洲妇女代表们望着丁玲，丁玲捧着达一寸的签名簿，交给苏联代表巴菲诺娃，请巴菲诺娃转给斯大林。这时候，人们都在回忆三十二年前列宁和斯大林领导俄国人民举行了惊天动地的社会主义十月革命的伟大历史事件；这时候，人们都在歌颂三十二年来斯大林始终不倦地为全世界被压迫人民谋求解放的辉煌功绩；这时候，人们都在高呼全世界人民团结在斯大林周围，保卫全世界持久和平。
    中华全国民主妇联副主席邓颖超代表着亿万中国妇女，高声喊道：“感谢你！斯大林同志！你指示我们：以武装的人民来反对武装的反革命。中国人民接受了你的指示，获得了史无前例的大胜利。”蔡畅、邓颖超、李德全和许广平带领着中国代表，高举着鲜红的一丈长的巨幅锦帐走到主席台上。蔡畅望着锦帐上画着的寿翁，庆祝斯大林万寿无疆。当中国妇女代表们把她们献给斯大林的祝寿礼物交给苏联代表时，我们看到了中苏两大民族的友谊的热情的拥抱，我们听到了全场代表一次又一次的欢呼：“斯大林万岁！乌拉斯大林！”，我们见到了殖民地半殖民地的代表们在欢跃。伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪在苏联代表的座位旁边，拉着印度代表的手，用力地不断地高喊“伟大的斯大林！”从社会主义劳动英雄乌巴伊杜拉耶的嘴里，发出了“斯大——林！”的声音，全场随即附和着这个声音，有节奏地连续地喊了三分钟。
    洛杉矶托儿所的儿童们，穿着同样色彩的衣裳，捧着鲜花，一个接着一个地走到代表们面前。他们站立在大会主席团的座位上，把写有“寿”字的红绸放在排列在中间的一个儿童的胸前。他们跟随着掌声唱起歌曲；歌声刚刚停止，他们又举起了小拳头，共同呼喊斯大林万岁。他们生活在胜利的新中国，他们再也不会遭受到象法国来宾所说的资本主义国家内孩子们饥俄的命运了。当他们把他们祝贺斯大林寿辰的礼物交给巴菲诺娃时，代表们连忙把这群孩子紧紧抱在手里，她们为这群孩子的幸福而感到骄傲。丁玲说：“斯大林！就是我们的儿童也将如何快乐的向你表示难以形容的感激。伟大的斯大林，因为你日日夜夜替下一代创造幸福事业。”
