On the Xin Yi River Line
	Fearing No Harsh Cold, Competing for Red Banners
    Under the joint efforts of the Party, government, military, and people of Northern Jiangsu, the Yi River Diversion Project is in full swing. Two hundred and forty thousand laborers from various counties, fearing neither the harsh cold nor the arduous work, have launched a fiery soil-moving competition, striving for model red banners.
    The name Wang Daqiao has caused a sensation throughout the Huaihai region, and even the whole of Northern Jiangsu. He is from Shuanghe Township, Zhangji District, Shuyang County. The Shuyang Wang Daqiao Labor Team, under his leadership, has victoriously completed this winter's task in ten days. The entire team of twenty-eight people is responsible for cutting 740 cubic meters of soil this winter. On average each person was assigned 26.31 cubic meters of soil. The soil transportation distance was 125.4 meters for half of the soil and 87 meters for the other half, for a total of 47 cubic meters of soil per person when converted to standard engineering volume.
    Completing a Winter's Task in Ten Days
    Initially, they planned to complete the task in eighteen days, but due to Wang Daqiao's strong leadership, the unity of the entire team, and their ability to scientifically allocate labor and continuously research and improve soil-digging techniques, they completed the entire task in ten days. They became the first glorious team in the district to complete the task. Now, all the laborers in the team have consciously requested to start working on tasks for the coming spring on the 7th.
    Learn from the Wang Daqiao Team!
    Under the influence of the Wang Daqiao Team, 283 out of 420 labor teams in Zhangji District have automatically held meetings and planned to accelerate their pace and learn from the Wang Daqiao Team. More than 30 labor teams have already made plans.
    Wang's Wife, Bao Sucai, is Also Capable
    Wang Daqiao's wife, Bao Sucai, is also able to learn from her husband. She leads the women, elderly, and weak in her group to transport grass, grind flour, carry out winter cultivation, and engage in sideline production. As the leader of the grass-delivery labor group, she was the first to deliver all 250 catties of grass from her own home. She also led Zhang Chengying and about ten other women to deliver all the grass from their own homes in one day. Following that, she and the elderly military dependents Wang Changyou and several other women drove a cattle cart to help the families of laborers with no labor power and the families of martyrs and soldiers, such as Yu Jiacheng and Xue He, deliver 1,800 catties of grass, and grind the second-phase rations for the laborers.
    Front and Rear Competing to Earn Merit
    The families of the Wang Daqiao Labor Team delivered rations to the worksite on the 5th of this month and reported on the winter cultivation, winter defense, and living conditions of each family. Wang Daqiao also reported on the living conditions of the team and the soil-digging competition. They encouraged each other, saying, "Both the front and the rear are working hard to earn merit and become models."
    In the heated competition, model teams have emerged in various counties. Starting with Wang Daqiao in Shuyang, followed by Xu Bahu in Lianshui, Li Wande in Siyang, and the Zhang Cao Detachment in Xin'an. They have all improved their efficiency and become model teams.
    Li Lanzhen and the Others Have Also Come
    There are many typical figures on the river worksite, such as Li Lanzhen from the Huaiyin District. She was a well-known female hero supporting the front lines during the Huaihai Campaign. At the start of this river dredging mobilization, she organized a women's team of nine people, who pushed grain carts from 140 li away, arriving at the river worksite on schedule.
    The Three Treasures of River Dredging: Dog Skin, Pot Stove, and Ragged Cotton-padded Jacket
    The transportation tools of the laborers include large ox carts (some pulled by as many as six oxen), wheelbarrows, small donkeys, and shoulder poles in various forms. On every highway in the Huaiyin District, long lines of people flowed continuously from morning till night.
    There is a very popular saying among the river workers: the three treasures of river dredging are "dog skin, pot stove, and ragged cotton-padded jacket." These three treasures represent the hard life of the laborers.

　　新沂河线上
  　不怕严寒争夺红旗
    在苏北党、政、军、民共同努力下，导沂工程正全面开展中，各县民工二十四万人不怕严寒，不怕工作艰巨，展开了火热的方土竞赛。争夺模范红旗。
    王大锹这名字轰动了整个准海区，甚至全苏北。他是沭阳章集区双河乡人。在他带头下的沭阳王大锹民工班，开工十天，已胜利完成今冬任务，他们全班二十八人，今冬共负责切滩七百四十公方土，平均每人划到二六．三一公方土，运土距离一半是一二五．四公尺，一半是八七公尺，共折合标准工程平均每人四七公方土。
    十天完成一冬任务
    起初他们计划需要十八天完成，但由于王大锹抓紧领导，全班团结一致，且能科学化地进行分工，不断研究改进挖土技术，因此十天内即告全部完成。成为全区完成任务的第一个光荣班。现在全班民工自觉要求，又于七日开工做明春的工作了。
    向王大锹班看齐！
    章集区四百二十个民工班，在王大锹班影响下有二百八十三个民工班自动开会，计划加快，向王大锹班看齐，有三十多个民工班并已订出计划。
    王妻包素才也能干
    王大锹老婆包素才，也能向丈夫看齐，她领导全组妇女老弱，运草、磨面、冬耕和副业生产。她是送草民工小组长，首先把自家二百五十斤草送清，并领导张成英等十来个妇女把各人自家草一天都送完，接着又和老年军属王长友及几个妇女赶了一部牛车，帮助无劳力的民工家及烈军属于家成、薛和等八户送草一千八百斤，替民工把第二期口粮都磨好。
    前方后方争立功劳
    王大锹民工班家属于本月五日送口粮上工，并报告全组冬耕、冬防及各家生活情形。王大锹也把班里生活，挖土竞赛等情形报告了一遍，他们互相鼓舞的说：“前后方都努力，争取立功做模范。”
    在热烈的竞赛中，各县都涌现了模范班。以沭阳的王大锹开始，接着就有涟水的徐八斛、泗阳的李万德以及新安的张曹分队等民工班。他们都提高了效能，成为模范班。
    李兰贞她们也来了
    在河工上有着很多典型人物，如淮阴分区的李兰贞，她过去是在淮海战役中一位赫赫有名的支前女英雄。这次扒河动员开始，她组织的妇女班共九人，从遥远的一百四十里外，推着运粮车，如期赶上河工。
    扒河三宝皮锅袄
    民工们的交通工具，有大牛车（多至有六只牛拖），独轮小车、小毛驴、担挑形形色色，在淮阴区的每条公路上，长长的行列自晨至暮，终日络绎不断。
    河工中有一句很流行的话，扒河三件宝“狗皮、锅灶、破棉袄”，这三件宝就代表了民工们的艰苦生活。
