Comrade Rao Shushi's
    Report on the Work in East China
    (Delivered at the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2, 1949)
    Chairman, fellow members, comrades:
    It is very important and necessary for the Central People's Government Committee to present the draft budget for the entire year of 1950 and the plan for issuing People's Victory Bonds for discussion. This is a powerful weapon for us to overcome current difficulties, smash the imperialist blockade, eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and consolidate the victory of the whole country. I fully support these two proposals.
    The national budget for next year assigns East China the task of public grain and taxes, accounting for 32 percent of the total national grain and tax revenue. This is a very arduous and glorious task. There is no doubt that we will face many difficulties in completing these tasks in the coming year. There are four main reasons for this:
    First, East China is still burdened with serious military tasks. Taiwan and the Zhoushan Islands are waiting for us to liberate them, which is a critical step in the final liberation of all of China. At present, in addition to supplying huge war expenses and supporting frontline expenditures, East China must also supply 2.7 million field army soldiers, local troops, and local staff, as well as hundreds of thousands of former employees.
    Second, East China is mainly a newly liberated area. Except for most of Shandong, a small part of northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui which are old areas that have undergone land reform, and most of northern Jiangsu and small parts of northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu and eastern Zhejiang which underwent rent and interest reduction during the Anti-Japanese War with a relatively solid mass base, the vast majority of areas are newly liberated areas after our army advanced southward. In the vast new areas, our administrative organs at all levels are not yet sound, bandits have not been completely eliminated, and feudal landlords still rule the countryside. They are trying every means to evade reasonable burdens. For example, in May and June this year, our million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River to fight, far from the rear. Only in southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and Zhejiang, we borrowed 400 to 500 million catties of grain. The landlords not only clamored loudly but also shifted most of the burden onto the laboring peasants.
    Third, this year, the disasters in East China, north of the Yangtze River, are extremely serious. According to preliminary statistics, Shandong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu have a total of over 52 million mu of affected fields, of which over 22 million mu have no harvest at all.
    Fourth, the imperialist Kuomintang has imposed an armed blockade and constant bombing and strafing on Shanghai and the coastal ports of East China, cutting off East China's overseas trade. Inland shipping and railway transportation are also frequently bombed and destroyed, making it impossible to supply various industrial raw materials in a timely manner, thus preventing production from recovering quickly.
    The aforementioned war burden, enemy blockade, severe disasters, and the feudal forces still ruling the vast rural areas of the new areas are the serious difficulties currently facing the people of East China. However, it must be pointed out that these difficulties are difficulties in victory and development. We must not only overcome them, but also we can overcome them completely.
    Why must we overcome these difficulties? Because guaranteeing the supply of the People's Liberation Army and local staff and actively supporting the People's Liberation Army in combat and rapidly liberating Taiwan, and cooperating with other areas of the country to liberate all other areas that have not yet been liberated, are not only the most effective way to smash the imperialist Kuomintang's remnant forces' armed blockade of Shanghai and coastal ports, but also the necessary condition for ensuring long-term peaceful construction in East China and the whole country. Without military victory and the liberation of Taiwan and the whole country, we will not be able to completely smash the enemy's blockade, and we will not be able to carry out long-term peaceful construction. At the same time, because supporting and assisting the peasant emancipation movement and mobilizing the broad masses of peasants to eliminate bandits, transform the political power, develop production, overcome disasters, and systematically carry out land reform, so that peasants are liberated from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords, are necessary conditions for the development of China's industry and commerce, the prosperity of the economy, the advancement of culture and education, and the realization of true democratization of the country. If we do not lead the peasant emancipation movement, so that the peasants who account for 80 percent of the population stand up and actively participate in supporting the war and economic and cultural construction work, then all difficulties cannot be overcome, and the victory of the Chinese revolution cannot be consolidated. Therefore, we must overcome all difficulties, actively support the war, and actively support the peasant emancipation movement.
    Why can we completely overcome these difficulties? Because we have the following various objective and subjective favorable conditions:
    First, East China now governs the three provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian, and the four administrative regions of northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Anhui, with a total of 36 cities and 405 counties. Such a vast area, with abundant products, is a very powerful force.
    Second, East China has a population of over 130 million (excluding the population of Taiwan). In addition to the broad masses of laboring peasants, there are also the most concentrated and relatively organized modern industrial workers in the country. Once they are mobilized and organized, they can overcome various difficulties.
    Third, the Ningbo, Shanghai, and Hangzhou triangle area in East China is the most developed area for industry and commerce in the country, and its tax revenue has always accounted for more than half of the country's total. Shanghai's tax revenue in June and July was only over 24 billion, but after a slight reorganization, it reached over 170 billion in August, September, and October, with an average of about 60 billion per month. This proves that the complaints of some industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai about the heavy taxes in June and July were incorrect. If we reorganize the tax revenue of major and medium-sized cities in East China, it is very likely to increase.
    Fourth, in the vast new urban and rural areas of southern China, we have begun to gain many new experiences in overcoming difficulties, which further enrich our weapons for overcoming difficulties. For example, in late June, the imperialists instigated the Kuomintang reactionaries to impose an armed blockade on Shanghai and our coastal ports. On August 3, the first Shanghai People's Representative Conference passed a resolution on six major tasks to smash the enemy's blockade and build a new Shanghai, which set off a struggle against the blockade by the people of Shanghai and East China. During this period, the Shanghai Military Control Commission promulgated two regulations on mediating labor-capital disputes in private enterprises and handling resumption of business and resumption of work disputes. The labor-capital relations in Shanghai began to be brought into line. We quickly restored railway and shipping traffic, allowing Shanghai to escape the panic over grain and coal. Now Shanghai regularly maintains a surplus of over 200,000 tons of coal and over 1.2 million dan of grain. Based on the principle of "five people sharing the food of three," we settled all former employees and took back those who had been laid off, so that they would not be displaced and have the opportunity to work and study. We took measures to reorganize tax revenue, increase income, streamline and save, and tighten expenditures to overcome price fluctuations in July and stabilize prices in the three months from August to October. Due to the above-mentioned measures, although Shanghai's industry and commerce suffered serious damage and blockade by the enemy, it gradually improved since late August. According to a survey by the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, the operating rate of Shanghai factories in August increased by 27 percent compared to July, and the number of factories with an operating rate of 70 percent in September was double that of July. Among them, the textile industry and the machinery industry recovered the fastest, proving that the difficulties caused by the imperialist armed blockade can be completely overcome. For another example, in the vast rural areas of the new areas of East China, we have taken a combination of active military suppression, political disintegration, and mobilizing the masses to arm themselves for self-defense to carry out the work of eliminating bandits. At present, except for Fujian, where we are still fully engaged in war, the bandit gangs in Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and northern Anhui have been basically eliminated, and the revolutionary order in the countryside has gradually been established. We have promulgated the Regulations on Rent and Interest Reduction in the New Rural Areas of East China and the Regulations on the Organization of Farmers' Associations. Except for Fujian, where we are still fully engaged in the war, the Farmers' Associations in various counties and districts of other new areas have been established one after another, and millions of peasants have joined the Farmers' Associations. The rent and interest reduction movement has been widely launched, and the evil landlords have been initially attacked. We have stipulated the Regulations on Reasonable Burden in Rural Areas and launched a struggle to clear up black land and report concealed land. It is estimated that we can collect the full annual public grain by the end of this year, proving that the task of public grain in the new areas can be completed under the conditions of peasant mobilization and strengthening of rural work.
    Fifth, we have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the consolidated unity of the people of all walks of life, and the efforts of the vast number of cadres. Chairman Mao's wise leadership guides us to victory. In the past six months, cities with a population of more than 30,000 in East China have universally convened people's representative conferences of all walks of life. The people's representative conferences of various counties in southern Jiangsu have mostly been held, and the people's representative conferences of other provinces and counties are also being convened one after another, demonstrating the unprecedented unity of the people of all walks of life, which is our invincible force to overcome difficulties. At the same time, we have hundreds of thousands of cadres who are closely linked with the broad masses of the working people. With their selfless, hard-working, tireless, and selfless spirit, they are fighting and striving for the interests of the vast majority of the masses, and guaranteeing the completion of all our tasks.
    In the past difficult period, we in East China mainly relied on the supply of manpower and materials from Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui to overcome the difficulties of the enemy's key attacks and achieve today's victory. Now East China has more than three times the population and cultivated land than at that time, as well as many modern industrial and commercial cities. Coupled with the above-mentioned favorable conditions and experience, I am full of confidence in accepting the glorious task given to the people of East China by the Central People's Government Committee, and call on all the people of East China to unite as one and fight to overcome difficulties and complete the task.

　　饶漱石委员
    关于华东工作情况的报告
    （一九四九年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上）
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次中央人民政府委员会提出一九五○年全年的收支概算及发行人民胜利公债的方案来讨论，是非常重要和必要的。这是我们克服当前困难，粉碎帝国主义的封锁，消灭国民党反动派的残余势力，及巩固全国胜利的有力武器。我完全拥护这两个方案。
    明年全国的收支概算给与华东的公粮、税收的任务，共占全国粮税收入总额百分之三十二。这是非常艰巨的，同时也是光荣的任务。我们在明年一年之内要完成这些任务，无疑的是有很多困难的，其主要原因有四：
    第一、华东目前仍担负着严重的军事任务，台湾和舟山群岛正迫待我们去解放，这是最后解放全中国的严重步骤。目前华东全区除供给巨大的战费及支援前线开支外，尚须供给二百数十万野战军、地方军及地方工作人员和数十万的旧职员。
    第二、华东区主要为新解放区。除山东的大部，苏北、皖北的一小部为经过土地改革的老区，及苏北的大部与皖北、苏南和浙东的小部在抗日时期曾经过减租减息，群众组织较有基础外，其余广大的地区皆为我军南进后的新解放区。在广大的新区内，我们的各级行政机关还不健全，土匪尚未肃清，封建地主还统治着农村，他们千方百计企图逃避合理负担。例如，今年五、六月间，我百万大军渡江作战，远离后方，仅在苏南、皖南、浙江等地征借四、五亿斤粮食，地主们不但大事叫嚣，并且将大部负担转嫁到劳动农民身上。
    第三、今年华东、长江以北地区，灾荒极端严重。据初步统计：山东、皖北、苏北共有受灾田亩五千二百余万亩，其中完全无收者达二千二百余万亩。
    第四、帝国主义国民党对我上海及华东沿海各港口实行武装封锁和不断轰炸扫射，使华东区对海外的贸易断绝，内地航运及铁路交通亦时遭轰炸破坏，各种工业原料无法及时供应，因而生产不能迅速恢复。
    上述战争负担，敌人封锁，严重灾荒及封建势力依然统治着广大新区的农村，这就是目前摆在我们华东人民面前的严重困难。但必须指出：这些困难是胜利和发展中的困难，我们不但必须加以克服，而且也是完全可以克服的。
    为什么我们对这些困难必须加以克服呢？因为保证人民解放军与地方工作人员的供给和积极支援人民解放军作战与迅速解放台湾，并配合全国各地解放其他一切尚未解放的地区，这不但是粉碎帝国主义国民党残余势力对上海和沿海各港口武装封锁的最有效办法，而且也是保障华东及全国进行长期和平建设的必要条件。如果没有军事的胜利和台湾与全国的解放，我们便无法彻底粉碎敌人的封锁，我们便无法进行长期的和平建设。同时因为拥护和支持农民翻身运动和动员广大农民群众肃清土匪，改造政权，发展生产，克服灾荒，并有系统地进行土地改革，使农民从封建地主压迫剥削中解放出来，是使中国工商业得以发展，经济得以繁荣，文化教育得以推进，国家得以走上真正民主化的必要条件。如果不领导农民翻身运动，使占人口百分之八十的农民站立起来，并积极参加支援战争与经济文化建设工作，则一切困难便无法克服，中国革命的胜利就无法巩固。所以，我们必须克服一切困难，积极支援战争和积极拥护农民翻身运动。
    为什么我们对这些困难可以完全克服呢？因为我们具备着下列各种主客观的有利条件：
    一、华东现辖有山东、浙江、福建三个省区，苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南四个行署区，共有三十六个市和四百零五县。这样广大的地区，有着丰富的物产，是一个非常强大的力量。
    二、华东共有人口一万三千余万（台湾人口尚未计入），除了广大的劳动农民以外，还有全国最集中和较有组织的近代产业工人，他们一经动员和组织起来，是可以克服各种困难的。
    三、华东宁、沪、杭三角地区为全国工商业最发达的地区，其税收一向占全国半数以上。六、七两月上海税收仅二百四十余亿，但稍加整理，八、九、十三个月即收入达一千七百余亿，每月平均约达六百亿。这证明六、七月间，上海部分工商业家对当时征税叫重是不正确的。如果我们对华东各大中小城市的税收再加以整理是很可能增加的。
    四、我们在江南广大新区城市和农村中，已开始获得克服困难的许多新的经验，这更充实了我们克服困难的武器。譬如：六月下旬，帝国主义指使国民党反动派对上海及我沿海各港口实行武装封锁，八月三日我上海第一次各界代表会议即通过粉碎敌人封锁和建设新上海六大任务的决议，掀起全上海全华东人民反封锁的斗争。在这期间，上海军管会曾颁布了调处私营企业劳资争议和处理复业复工纠纷的两项条例，上海劳资关系开始纳入正轨。我们迅速恢复铁路、航运交通，使上海摆脱粮煤恐慌。现在上海经常保存余煤二十余万吨，粮食一百二十余万担。我们本着三个人的饭五个人匀着吃的原则，安置一切旧有员工，并收回被裁减人员，使他们不致流离失所，使他们有工作学习的机会。我们采取整理税收、增加收入及精简节约、紧缩开支的办法，克服七月份物价波动，使八月至十月三个月内物价平稳。由于上述种种措施，上海工商业虽遭受敌人的严重破坏和封锁，但自八月下旬以来即逐渐好转。据上海工商联合会筹备会调查，八月份上海工厂的开工率比七月份增加百分之二十七，九月份开工率达七成的工厂比七月份增多一倍，其中纺织业、机器业恢复最快，证明帝国主义武装封锁所引起的困难是完全可以克服的。又譬如：在华东广大新区农村中，我们采取积极军事清剿、政治瓦解与发动群众武装自卫三者相互结合的办法，进行肃清土匪工作。在目前除福建外，浙江、苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北成股土匪已经基本肃清，农村的革命秩序已逐渐建立。我们曾颁布了华东新区农村减租减息条例与农民协会组织条例。除福建仍在全力进行战争外，其他新区各县各区农民协会已先后建立，数百万农民已经加入农民协会，减租减息运动普遍开展，恶霸地主已受到初步打击。我们规定农村合理负担条例，展开清查黑地、检举隐瞒的斗争，估计到今年年底可征齐全年公粮，证明在农民发动及农村工作加强的条件下新区的公粮任务是可以完成的。
    五、我们有毛主席英明的领导，有各界人民巩固的团结，有广大干部的努力。毛主席的英明领导引导着我们走向胜利。半年来华东区三万以上人口的城市，普遍召开了各界人民代表会议，苏南各县人民代表会议已大都开过，其他各省各县人民代表会议亦正在先后召开中，表现了各界人民空前的大团结，这便是我们克服困难，不可战胜的力量。同时，我们有数十万与广大劳苦群众密切联系的干部，他们以大公无私、艰苦奋斗、不辞劳瘁、不顾牺牲的忘我精神，为着最大多数群众的利益而奋斗努力，并保证着我们一切任务的完成。
    在过去困难的时期，我们华东主要依靠山东、苏北、皖北人力物力的供给，尚能克服敌人重点进攻的困难，取得今天的胜利。现在我华东已拥有比当时多至三倍以上的人口和耕地，以及许多近代工商业的城市，再加上上述有利条件和经验，因此，我满怀信心接受中央人民政府委员会所给予华东人民的光荣任务，并号召全华东人民一致团结起来，为克服困难，完成任务而斗争。
