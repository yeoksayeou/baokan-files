Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: According to a report from Diantong News Agency citing London's "Reynolds News," France is recruiting Germans in the French-occupied zone of West Germany to serve as soldiers in the aggressive war against Vietnam. A German soldier in the French army in Vietnam told the newspaper's international news editor, Lamond, that the French Foreign Legion in Saigon was full of Nazis.

Another report from the Singapore Nanyang Siang Pau, citing a Vietnam dispatch, states that due to the increasing intensity of the Vietnam People's Army's attacks on the French army, the morale of the French troops is very low. In October, one hundred mercenaries (mostly German and Italian fascist prisoners of war) defected to the Vietnam People's Army. In view of the increasing number of soldiers defecting and deserting, the French military authorities recently ordered the remaining mercenaries to hand over their weapons, only arming them when the Vietnam People's Army launches attacks.

　　法帝竟在西德招兵侵越法军逃亡日增
    【新华社北京十七日电】据电通社引伦敦“雷诺新闻”消息，法国正大西德法占区内征募德人当兵参加进攻越南的侵略战争。一个在越南法国军队里的德国士兵告诉该报国际新闻编辑拉蒙德说，西贡法军外国兵团里充满了纳粹分子。
    另据新加坡南侨日报载越南通讯称，由于越南解放军向法军的进攻日益加剧，法军士气甚为低落。十月间，有一百名雇佣兵（大部系德意法西斯军战俘）投向越南解放军。法军当局鉴于士兵的叛变和逃亡日多，最近下令收回残余雇佣兵的武器，只在越南解放军进行袭击时才予以武装。
