　　[Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The Chinese People's Liberation Army Chongqing Military Control Commission was established on the 3rd by order. Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar, appointed Zhang Jichun, Chen Xilian, Zhang Linzhi, Xie Fuzhi, Cao Diqiu, Duan Junyi, Yan Hongyan, Wang Jinsan, Wang Yunrui, Ren Baige, Luo Shigao, and Liu Minghui as members of the Military Control Commission, with Zhang Jichun as Chairman, and Chen Xilian and Zhang Linzhi as Vice-Chairmen. All members have now taken office, and military representatives have been dispatched to various departments to begin takeover work.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Chongqing's industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors are gradually recovering. The waterworks and power plant, which are of utmost concern to the lives of the city's people, were restored one day after liberation. Although the boiler of a plant under the Electric Power Company was destroyed by the fleeing Kuomintang bandits, all the plant's workers worked hard to repair it within only one day and night, restoring power supply. Public transportation in the city and suburbs was also restored on the 2nd. Long-distance buses have resumed service to Qijiang and Nanchuan in the south, Jiangjin, Yongchuan, and Rongchang in the west, and Beibei in the north. Yangtze River shipping reaches Fuling in the east and Jiangjin Baisha in the west, and the Jialing River reaches Hechuan in the north. Due to the restoration of transportation, daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, coal, and vegetables from the surrounding countryside are being transported in a steady stream, and the supply of rice is plentiful. Nearly all of the city's more than 50,000 stores have reopened, with rice, oil, and general merchandise being the most actively traded. Export merchants, who have been out of business for nearly a year, are now actively preparing to resume operations in order to restore the export of Sichuan Province's famous bristles, tung oil, raw silk, and medicinal materials.
