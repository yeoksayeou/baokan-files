　　After Establishing the Teacher Specialization System

　　——A Report from Beijing Municipal Fourth Middle School

　　The teacher specialization system in Beijing's municipal middle schools has been initially established. Compared with the past, teachers in general have made significant achievements in teaching, guiding students' extracurricular learning, and strengthening political and professional studies, presenting a new atmosphere. Here, we will introduce the situation of Municipal Fourth Middle School as an example.

　　I. Improvements in Professional Skills

　　1. Preparation for lessons has become more thorough, and new teaching materials have been added, improving teaching efficiency. For example, geography teacher Zhou Eqing spends four or five hours preparing for a one-hour lesson, making his lectures vivid, fresh, and substantial, which is welcomed by the students. Physics teacher Zhang Zie has been using the same old methods for more than ten years, and students felt that his materials were insufficient and he was not putting in enough effort. After implementing the specialization system, his preparation of teaching materials became more thorough, he often answered students' questions after class, and he also increased students' interest in learning physics, making him one of the most popular teachers. Chemistry teacher Liu Jingkun said: "Now I have the energy to understand the students, and teaching efficiency has increased. Chemistry experiment preparation is meticulous. An experiment that used to take two hours can now be completed smoothly in one hour and twenty minutes, and the consumption and damage of instruments are reduced. In the past, I often missed classes, but now I not only don't miss classes, but I can also make up for the lessons I missed before." In addition, there are many such examples.

　　2. Extracurricular guidance for students' learning: In the past, teachers left after class and there was no question of guidance. Now the situation is different. Students ask teachers to tutor them in algebra, physics, and chemistry in high school and junior high school. Chinese teachers guide students in publishing wall newspapers after class. Physical education and music teachers guide students' sports activities and music practice after class. Daily extracurricular life is quite active and fulfilling.

　　3. Grading homework: In particular, Chinese teachers grade students' compositions carefully and responsibly in the teachers' office every day, more so than before.

　　4. Strengthening professional group studies: Subject-specific research groups often hold meetings to discuss teaching materials and methods, study how to teach new teaching materials, and actively participate in various subject-specific research associations advocated by the Teachers' Union, which greatly helps in improving teaching.

　　II. Rationalization of the Timetable

　　Arranging the timetable used to be the most troublesome task, but now it has been solved and rationalized. The phenomenon of having physical education and music in the morning and algebra in the afternoon is gone. Now science subjects are scheduled for the first three periods in the morning, and the science workload is distributed evenly, unlike before when there were seven hours of science subjects in one day, making students feel the workload was heavy. And there is no longer a day where the morning is all physical education, music, and library. In short, everyone arranges the schedule in the way they think is most reasonable, completely starting from the students' learning, and not based entirely on accommodating the teachers' time, as in the past. It is also much easier to adjust the class schedule than it used to be.

　　III. Cooperating with Administration to Carry Out Ideological Education Makes the Integration of Teaching and Guidance Completely Possible

　　Chemistry teacher Liu Jingkun said: "In the past, I didn't understand the school's administrative situation, so I couldn't assist with the work. Now, although my help is not enough, I have already understood the school's administration." Therefore, the promotion of administrative work has become more convenient. Now, whenever there is something that requires teachers to hold a meeting or a meeting of all faculty and staff, it can be done at any time. At the weekly Monday meeting, all teachers can participate in any important reports and calls made by the school.

　　IV. Faculty and Staff Have Time for Political Study

　　Now faculty and staff are organized into political study groups to conduct political discussions without delaying regular classes and extracurricular guidance, once a week. Old chemistry teacher Liu Jingkun confessed frankly: "I haven't read a newspaper in the past thirty years, and in the past five years I only looked at the headlines. Now I have time to read the newspaper." Because in the past he taught at three schools every week, with forty hours of classes.

　　V. Colleagues Are More United

　　Teachers are all at school during the day, and there are many opportunities for colleagues to talk and interact. They inspire each other, exchange experiences, and get to know each other well. Many female teachers said: "When I come to Fourth Middle School, I feel particularly happy. Colleagues have a harmonious relationship, talk and laugh freely, without restraint. Some sing, some play ball, some play checkers, and some learn Russian. It's lively and happy."

　　建立教员专任制以后
    ——北京市市立四中通讯
    北京市的市立中等学校的教员专任制，已经初步建立起来了。和以前比较，一般教员教学和指导学生课外学习以及加强政治业务学习各方面，都有了显著的成绩，呈现了一番新气象。现只就市立四中一个学校的材料，作一个介绍。
    一、业务上的改进
    １、预备功课充分了，并且补充了新教材，提高了授课效率。例如：地理教员周额青对一小时的教材，用四五小时准备，因而课堂上讲的生动新鲜充实，受到同学的欢迎。物理教员张子锷教课，十余年来老一套，学生觉得他讲的材料不够，也不卖力气。实行专任后，准备教材充实，课外常给学生解答问题，同时提高了学生们学习物理课的兴趣，因而成为学生最欢迎的教员之一。化学教员刘景昆曾这样说：“现在有精力了解学生了，教学效率加大了，化学实验准备周密，原来二小时的实验，现在一小时二十分可以顺利完成，并且减少消耗及破损仪器。以前常耽误课，现在不仅不误课，并且可以补足以前所误的功课了。”此外，象这样的例子还很多。
    ２、课外指导学生学习：在过去教员们下课就走，根本谈不到指导，现在情形不同了，学生们在课外请教员补代数、补物理化学的，高初中都有。国文教师则在课外指导学生办壁报。体育与音乐先生在课外指导学生的体育活动和音乐练习。每天课外生活相当活跃充实。
    ３、批改作业，特别是国文教员每天在教员办公室里批改学生的作文，比从前更加仔细负责了。
    ４、加强业务组的学习：各科业务研究组都常开会讨论教材教法，研究如何教授新教材，并积极的参加教联会所倡导的各业务研究会，在提高教学上帮助很大。
    二、课程表的合理化
    功课表排列是过去最头疼的工作，现在解决了而且合理化了，早晨上体育音乐下午上代数的现象没有了，现在把理科功课都排在上午头三节，而且把理科分量平均开，不象以前一天七小时都是理科，使学生感到分量重，也没有一天上午除了体育、音乐就是图书。总之大家认为怎样排合理。就怎样排，完全从学生的学习出发，不是象过去完全以迁就教员的时间为根据，要想调动钟点也比过去容易多了。
    三、配合行政进行思想教育实行教导合一完全成为可能
    化学教员刘景昆说：“以前不了解学校行政的情况，无从协助工作，现在虽帮助不够，但是已经了解了学校的行政。”因此行政工作的推动方便了，现在有什么事情需要召开教员开会或全体教职员会，随时都可以。星期一周会学校有什么重要报告及号召全体教员都能参加。
    四、教职员的政治学习有了时间
    现在教职员们都编成政治学习小组，不耽误正课和课外指导进行政治讨论，每周一次。老化学教员刘景昆曾坦白地说：“过去三十年来未读过报纸，近五年来仅看标题，现在有时间读报了。”因为他过去每周兼三个学校，任四十个钟头的课。
    五、同仁们更加团结了
    白天教员们都在学校里，同仁们交谈和接触的机会很多，谈话中互相启发交流经验彼此都很熟悉。很多女教师说：“一来到四中觉得特别愉快，同仁们感情融洽，谈笑自如，没有拘束，有的唱歌，有的打球，有的跳棋，有时学俄文，又活泼又愉快。”
