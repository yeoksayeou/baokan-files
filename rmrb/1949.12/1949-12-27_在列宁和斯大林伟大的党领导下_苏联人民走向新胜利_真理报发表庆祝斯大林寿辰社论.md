　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th: TASS, Moscow - Soviet newspapers continue to publish materials regarding Stalin's seventieth birthday, and feature on the first and second pages congratulatory messages from foreign government leaders and state organs, mass organizations and individuals, as well as congratulatory messages from domestic party, Soviet, and mass organizations, and employees of various enterprises. Newspapers also carry many news items describing the festive celebrations of Stalin's seventieth birthday by working people around the world.

　　*Pravda* published an editorial titled "Marching Towards New Victories Under the Great Leadership of Lenin and Stalin's Party," stating: In these days of celebrating Comrade Stalin's seventieth birthday, the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, the invincible friendship of all nationalities, and fervent Soviet patriotism have once again been demonstrated to the world with renewed strength. The Soviet people are more closely united around their own party, around the great leader Comrade Stalin. To march towards new victories under the leadership of the great Stalin – this is the unanimous aspiration of all Soviet people. To maintain a strong surge in the political and labor activity of the working people, to mobilize their strength in order to achieve new accomplishments in all aspects of communist construction – this is the major task of the party organizations.

　　The editorial then pointed out: Party organizations must tirelessly strengthen their ties with the broad masses of the working people, learn from the masses, carefully listen to their opinions, encourage their creative suggestions, and unite the non-party, active worker masses around the party organizations. Without doing so, work cannot be successful. In our country, the achievements of socialist construction are indeed enormous. But we must not be content with the achievements we have already made, and must always remember that continuous advancement and continuous progress are the laws of development of Soviet society.

　　The editorial concluded: To strive to emulate the example of the great Lenin and Stalin in all aspects, to be tireless, selfless builders of communist society – this is the criterion of life and activity for all party and non-party Bolsheviks.

　　在列宁和斯大林伟大的党领导下
　  苏联人民走向新胜利
    真理报发表庆祝斯大林寿辰社论
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各报继续刊载关于斯大林七十寿辰的材料，并在第一与第二版发表外国政府首长与国家机关、群众团体和个人的贺电、及国内的党、苏维埃及各群众组织与各企业员工的贺电。报纸也刊载许多消息，描写全世界劳动人民节日般地庆贺斯大林七十寿辰的情形。
    真理报以“在列宁与斯大林伟大的党领导下走向新胜利”为题发表社论称：在庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰的这些日子里，苏联社会在精神上和政治上的团结、各族人民不可战胜的友谊和热烈的苏维埃爱国主义，以新的力量再一次地对全世界表现出来了。苏联人民更加紧密地团结在他们自己的党的周围、伟大的领袖斯大林同志的周围。在伟大的斯大林领导下走向新胜利，这就是全体苏联人的一致愿望。使劳动人民政治与劳动活动方面保持强有力的高涨，动员他们的力量以便在共产主义建设的各方面获得新成就，这就是党组织的重大任务。
    社论继而指出：党组织必须不倦地加强他们与广大的劳动群众的联系，向人民群众学习，周详地倾听他们的意见，鼓励他们创造性的建议，并且把非党的、积极的工人群众团结在党组织的周围。不这样做，工作是不可能有成功的。在我国，社会主义建设的成就的确巨大。但是我们一定不要满足于我们已经获得的成就，要切切记着：不断地前进和不断地进步是苏维埃社会的发展法则。
    社论结语称：要在各方面争相效法伟大的列宁和斯大林的榜样，要做不倦的、忘我的共产主义社会的建设者，这就是所有党和非党的布尔什维克的生活与活动的准则。
