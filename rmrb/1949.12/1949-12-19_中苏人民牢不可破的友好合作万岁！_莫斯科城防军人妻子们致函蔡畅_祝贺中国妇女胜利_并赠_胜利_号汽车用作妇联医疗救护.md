Dear Comrade Cai Chang:
In these happy and exciting days experienced by the great Chinese people, we, the wives of the soldiers of the victorious Soviet Army's Moscow City Defense Forces, extend to you and all the women of the People's Republic of China whom you represent, heartfelt greetings filled with love.

We watch the heroic struggles of the Chinese people and their outstanding sons and daughters for the glory, freedom, and independence of their motherland with great solidarity and friendship.

Our hearts and thoughts are always with you. We have always admired your courage and determination. Now, as the happy days of your historic victory arrive, we are even more proud of you and wholeheartedly congratulate you on the new era that has opened in the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese people with the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Dear friends, we sincerely hope that you will rapidly and victoriously completely crush the enemy and unite the entire motherland into a unified People's Republic.

To express our sincere friendship, we have decided to purchase and equip a "Victory" automobile with our money and donate it to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. We hope that this car will be used for medical relief for women and children.

Please accept our humble gift and wish you complete victory for the domestic democratic forces and socialism.

Women of the People's Republic of China, we are united in our efforts to strive for peace. We must unite our forces against the instigators of a new world war and strive for peace and democracy throughout the world!

Long live the People's Republic of China, headed by Mao Zedong, the outstanding and experienced leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people!

Long live Comrade Stalin, the best friend of the Chinese people, the brilliant leader and mentor of all progressive mankind, and Marshal of the Soviet Union!
