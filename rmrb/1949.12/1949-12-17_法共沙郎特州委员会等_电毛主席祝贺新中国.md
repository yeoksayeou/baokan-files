The French Communist Party Committee of Charente, etc.
Cables Chairman Mao to Congratulate New China

[Reported by this newspaper] The French Communist Party Committee of Charente-Maritime and the Committee of the Ramage Factory in Tulle City sent telegrams and letters to Chairman Mao Zedong, warmly congratulating the founding of the People's Republic of China. The original texts of the telegrams and letters are as follows:

(1) Dear Comrades:
    The Charente-Maritime Committee of the French Communist Party, believing that it represents the feelings of the working people of this state, extends its congratulations on the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    This is a significant event that has opened up a path for the Chinese people, who number 475 million, to move towards the democratic and free camp led by the Soviet Union, and has ended the enslavement policies implemented by American and British imperialism in China.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Mao Zedong!
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and French people!

    Serge Varenne, Secretary of the Charente-Maritime Committee of the French Communist Party
    October 5, 1949
    La Rochelle

(2) Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

    This committee, in the name of the Communist Party members of the Ramage Factory in Tulle City, pays tribute to the heroic fighters of the Chinese People's Army and the working people.

    We have always been very concerned about your struggle for democracy and peace. Therefore, the birth of the People's Republic of China is considered by all our members to be a very great event, and we welcome it with joy.

    This event has ended the exploitation of China by British and American imperialism.

    China, with its 480 million men and women, has entered the peaceful and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, further strengthening our confidence that the forces of peace will triumph over the warmongers.

    The Communist Party members of the Ramage Factory in Tulle City and all the Communist Party members in France will certainly use the example indicated by the Chinese Communist Party members to create various conditions for establishing socialism in our own country.

    Please accept the fraternal greetings from the 180 Communist Party members of the Ramage Factory in Tulle City!

    Committee of the Ramage Factory in Tulle City, French Communist Party

    这事件结束了英美帝国主义对中国的剥削。
