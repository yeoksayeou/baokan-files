Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th. The "Exhibition of the Life and Struggle of Asian Workers and Women," jointly organized by the Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference, grandly opened at Zhongshan Park in Beijing at noon today. Among those attending the opening ceremony were the preparatory committee members of the Asian Women's Representative Conference and representatives from various countries who had already arrived in Beijing, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation He Xiangning, Vice-Chairpersons Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Secretary-General Qu Mengjue, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League Feng Wenbin, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation Liao Chengzhi, and over a hundred guests. Soviet Ambassador to China Roshchin also attended with embassy staff.

Amidst the biting cold wind, after the opening military music concluded, Li Dequan first delivered a speech, saying: This exhibition has great international and historical significance. From here, one can see the different lives and struggles of workers and women in the advanced socialist Soviet Union, the new democratic Mongolia, Korea, and China, as well as in countries still under the oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Iran. It will help us exchange revolutionary experiences from various countries and promote mutual understanding. Next, Holopova, sent by the Soviet Union to China to oversee the exhibition arrangement, spoke. She said: In order to express the Soviet people's warm friendship towards the Chinese people, Soviet women meticulously prepared the exhibition of the life and struggle of Soviet women in Moscow. They enthusiastically collected many valuable items as gifts for the women of free China. After the chief representative of Korea, Park Chung-ae, and the Iranian representative, Massin Farroqi, spoke, Mrs. Guguili, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, spoke. She first expressed gratitude on behalf of the Women's International Democratic Federation to the Chinese women. Because Chinese women put forth tremendous effort and made great sacrifices, the Asian Women's Representative Conference was able to be held in the liberated capital of China. She pointed out that this exhibition can help us understand how women and children of oppressed nations in Asia are gradually liberating themselves from the oppression of imperialism and its lackeys, and the Soviet women, with 32 years of revolutionary victory, are our best example.

In solemn music, Li Dequan held the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening. Soviet Ambassador Roshchin, China's Xu Guangping, Korea's Xu Zhenshu, and Mongolia's Duolongmaimaiwa cut ribbons at various pavilions. The preparatory committee members, representatives, and guests then successively visited the pavilions. The Exhibition of the Life and Struggle of Asian Workers and Women includes exhibits from nine countries: the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, Korea, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Iran. The exhibits are divided into four pavilions. The Soviet pavilion has a "Gift Exhibition Room for Soviet Women to Chinese Women," displaying countless valuable gifts. The exhibition officially opened at 2:00 PM today and will continue for twenty days for public viewing.
