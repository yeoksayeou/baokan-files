　　Gain Experience in Running Remedial Schools
　　Party Committee Grasp Ideological Leadership, Do a Good Job in Teaching, Adapt to the Different Characteristics of Adults, and Guide Them to Learn Culture
　　[Our Newspaper News] The organs and troops of the North China Military Region stationed in Beijing have recently summarized their experience in running after-work remedial schools. The summary states: Since May, the organs and troops of the North China Military Region stationed in Beijing have successively established ten after-work remedial schools. The students include cadres and odd-job personnel with a primary school education or above (illiterate people have separate literacy classes), totaling more than 1,300 people, of which cadres account for 56% and odd-job personnel account for 44%. This organization consists of 70% of those who should participate in learning. The enthusiasm for learning is very high. Some students, because there are few people in their units to establish a school, have to travel fifteen or sixteen li to attend classes, without delaying their studies. In the past few months, nearly twenty Chinese language lessons have been learned, many new characters have been recognized, a preliminary understanding of punctuation marks and grammar has been gained, incorrect and colloquial characters have been corrected, the bad habit of writing "self-created characters" has been rectified, and writing diaries and manuscripts has become much smoother. Elementary arithmetic has been learned through the four basic operations, and intermediate arithmetic has learned fractions through the four basic operations, which has improved the ability of calculation and reasoning, and significantly improved the existing cultural level. This proves that after-work remedial schools are the best organizational form for organizing on-the-job personnel to study. It is being gradually promoted to various troops and military regions, and has been universally established in organs above the division level. This makes the education of on-the-job cadres move towards a standardized path, turning the army into a huge school.
　　From the experience of this work, strengthening organizational leadership and doing a good job in teaching are the central keys to running schools well. The work of after-work remedial schools must be brought onto the daily work agenda of the Party committee, as one of the important work tasks. The principals of each branch school should be responsible comrades who personally supervise and inspect, and solve the main difficulties and problems in teaching; and combine the strength of the Party and the administration to conduct in-depth mobilization, encourage learning enthusiasm, commend learning models, and carry out mass-based comparison and evaluation movements. The learning achievements of students should be used as one of the criteria for cadre assessment.
　　Some branch schools push the leadership responsibility to the assistants or cultural teachers, the system is lax, forming a laissez-faire situation, and some even believe that running remedial schools hinders work, so the number of students is decreasing day by day.

　　华北军区驻京机关部队
    办补习学校获经验
    党委抓紧思想领导作好教务工作　适应成年人不同特点引导学文化
    【本报讯】华北军区在京机关部队顷将举办工余补习学校的经验作出总结。总结称：华北军区在京各机关部队，从五月起，先后成立了工余补习学校十处，学员包括干部和初小以上程度的勤杂人员（文盲另有识字课），共有一千三百多人，其中干部占百分之五十六，勤杂人员占百分之四十四。它组织了应当参加学习人员的百分之七十。大学的学习热情很高，有的学员因本单位人少未成立学校，要跑十五、六里路程赶去上课，也不耽误学习。几个月来，国文已学了近二十课，识了不少生字，初步懂得了标点符号及文法，改正了错白字，纠正了写“特创字”的坏习惯，写日记，写稿子都通顺多了。初级算术学了整整四则，中级学了分数四则，提高了演算和推理的能力，相当地提高了现有的文化水平。证明了工余补习学校是组织在职人员学习的最好组织形式。并逐渐推广到各部队、军区，在师以上的机关都已普遍地设立起来了。使得在职干部的教育走向正规的道路，把军队变成巨大的学校。
    从这段工作的经验来看，加强组织领导，做好教务工作是办好学校的中心关键。工余补习学校的工作必须提到党委日常工作议程中去，作为重要工作任务之一，各分校的校长要由负责同志来担任，亲自督促检查，解决教学当中主要困难问题；并结合党和行政力量进行深入动员，鼓舞学习热情，表扬学习模范，开展群众性的比评运动。并把学员的学习成绩做为干部鉴定标准之一。
    有的分校把领导责任推给协理员或文化教员，制度松弛形成自流，甚至有的认为办补习学校妨碍工作，这样学生就日益减少。
