Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st -- The full text of the "Resolution of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference Regarding the United Nations Commission on Korea" is as follows:

　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference has heard the report of the Korean delegation and learned about the role of the United Nations Commission on Korea. The Korean trade union delegation, based on irrefutable evidence, clearly pointed out that the work of this commission is actually tantamount to violating the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, because it has consolidated the pro-fascist reactionary forces in Korea and the anti-labor and anti-democratic rule of the American militarists occupying South Korea.

　　The Conference requests the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions to raise the issue of the suppression of trade union freedom and the people's democratic rights in South Korea with the United Nations.

　　It requests the Executive Bureau to inform the workers of France, Turkey, El Salvador, India, Australia, and the Philippines about the activities of the representatives of these countries in the United Nations Commission on South Korea.

　　The Conference requests the Executive Bureau to call on the trade unions of these countries to demand that their respective governments withdraw the representatives participating in this United Nations Commission.

　　亚洲澳洲工会代表会议的决议和宣言
    关于联合国派赴南朝鲜调查团的决议
    【新华社北京一日电】“亚洲澳洲工会代表会议关于联合国派赴南朝鲜调查团的决议”全文如下：
    亚澳工会代表会议听取了朝鲜代表团的报道，得悉联合国派赴南朝鲜调查团的作用。朝鲜工会代表团，根据不能反驳的证据，明确地指出，这一调查团的工作实际等于违反了联合国宪章中规定的原则，因为它巩固了朝鲜亲法西斯反动派及占据南朝鲜的美国军国主义者的反劳工与反民主的统治地位。
    代表会议提请世界工联执行局向联合国提出关于在南朝鲜工会自由与人民民主权利遭受打击的问题。
    它提请执行局向法国、土耳其、萨尔瓦多、印度、澳大利亚与菲律宾的工人报道这些国家的代表在联合国南朝鲜调查团中所作的勾当。
    代表会议提请执行局号召这些国家的工会向各该国政府要求撤回参加这一联合国调查团的代表。
