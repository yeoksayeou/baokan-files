The implementation of the United Nations Charter took place four years ago, on October 24, 1945.

The idea of establishing a new international organization to maintain peace and security was put forward by the Soviet Union. As early as 1944, Comrade Stalin pointed out the need to "establish a special organization composed of representatives of peace-loving countries to defend peace and maintain security." The Soviet Union played an active role in the composition of the United Nations Charter, which is based on the principles of promoting peaceful and democratic cooperation among countries under the current situation.

These four years of implementing the United Nations Charter have indeed proved that the success of the United Nations directly depends on the diplomatic policies of the major powers, which are entrusted by the Charter with the primary responsibility for maintaining peace. The two different lines formed in post-war international politics have determined two different attitudes towards the United Nations.

One line is the policy of American monopoly capitalists who, under the eagerness to launch new wars and aggression, forcibly establish their supreme world rule. The provisions of the Charter have become an obstacle to the aggressive ambitions of the US-UK bloc. They abandoned the policy of cooperation and proceeded to transform the international organization into a tool for carrying out their adventurous plans. This US-UK bloc's activities that violate the principles of the Charter are carried out both within the United Nations and outside the scope of the United Nations—forming various forms of economic, military, and political alliances that violate the purposes and Charter of the United Nations.

The other line is the line of friendship, cooperation, and peace among nations—this is the policy followed by the countries in the democratic and anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. These countries have impeccably abided by the United Nations Charter and their other international obligations. They tirelessly strive to maintain and achieve the democratic goals and principles of the Charter, and to safeguard the prestige of the United Nations from being undermined by the actions of enemies of genuine international cooperation.

One of the fundamental principles of the UN's structure and activities is the sovereign equality of all member states. Comrade Stalin once said:

"If the United Nations organization succeeds in maintaining the principle of equality in the future, then it will undoubtedly play a major and positive role in ensuring world peace and security."

One of the fundamental purposes of the United Nations as defined in the Charter is:

"To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace." (Article 1, Paragraph 2)

Article 2 also specifies that "The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members." It is obvious that the principle of sovereign equality of all countries proclaimed in the Charter cannot be reconciled with the policy of the US-UK bloc to enslave other countries in order to establish Wall Street's world domination. The ruling groups of the United States and Britain are violating and destroying this principle.

Denying the sovereignty and independence of certain countries is their main means of doing so. In US and British foreign policy, this line is manifested in the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, a series of extortionate and unequal treaties, and the signing of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. Of course, the countries participating in this treaty, apart from the United States, are actually deprived of their sovereignty. And the United States' arrogant demands for so-called "equal opportunities," "freedom of trade," "freedom of navigation," "freedom of inland waterways," etc., are also for the same purpose. The result of this demand is that the most powerful United States in the capitalist world attempts to economically, technically, and militarily subdue the weaker and war-weakened capitalist countries to obey the United States, turn them into US vassals, and follow the policies of the US State Department. In the actual activities of the United Nations, this vassalage is manifested in the obedience of certain countries' representatives to American orders. This is the source of the notorious "voting machine."

On the other hand, the equal treatment of all countries, large and small, is one of the fundamental principles of Soviet foreign policy. This is reasonably based on the principle of national self-determination, and the Soviet state's national policy is also based on this principle of national self-determination.

The Soviet Union strongly supports the principle of equality of national sovereignty in the United Nations because, as Comrade Stalin once pointed out, "The strength of an international organization lies in the fact that it is based on the principle of equality among countries, rather than on the principle of some countries dominating others."

The equality of national sovereignty is closely linked to another fundamental concept of the Charter—the concept of great power unanimity. For all matters other than procedural matters, a resolution of the Security Council—the body "primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security" under the Charter—can only take effect if it receives the affirmative votes of seven members, including all permanent members (Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the Charter). Similarly, due to the importance and authority of the great powers, they bear the primary responsibility for defending peace, and they have the right to disapprove resolutions that they believe are inconsistent with the goal of defending peace. Cooperation among the great powers based on the principle of equality is an indispensable condition for maintaining international peace.

When the war was still going on, Comrade Stalin said of international organizations:

"Can we estimate that the activities of this international organization will be very effective? If the major powers that bore the brunt of the war against Hitlerite Germany continue their spirit of unity and coordination after the war, they will be effective. If this main condition is violated, then they will not be effective."

Since the establishment of the United Nations, the principle of unanimous coordination of the permanent members of the Security Council has been the target of malicious attacks by representatives of the US-UK bloc. They call this "intolerable veto power," "unjust veto power," etc. As early as the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, the US vassals put forward a resolution to amend the principle of unanimous coordination in the Charter. This direct attack on the foundation of the organization was repelled by the Soviet delegation with the support of other delegations. At the second session of the General Assembly, a strategy of flanking attack was underway. At this time, the US delegation was no longer sneaking around but acting openly. It put forward a resolution advocating the organization of a so-called "Interim Committee" under the guise of "subsidiary bodies" to study, investigate, and discuss various issues during the sessions of the General Assembly. And it proposed that the powers of this committee could be extended to issues of international peace and security. Needless to say, the principle of great power coordination would not be implemented in this committee. This was an attempt to replace the Security Council with the Interim Committee in order to have the help of more puppets when deciding on matters. The US delegation used its voting machine to force through this resolution, although it was somewhat modified. However, it turned out that the Interim Committee was a stillborn thing, because the Soviet Union and other countries refused to participate in organizations that clearly contradicted the United Nations Charter. But regardless, on October 19 this year, under the pressure of the US delegation, the majority of representatives of the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly decided to recommend to the General Assembly to extend the existence of the Interim Committee indefinitely.

Although all attempts to undermine the Security Council have failed, attacks on the principle of unanimous coordination continue to this day. Proposals to "liberalize the veto," "abolish the veto," and similar things are proceeding very rapidly one after another.

American politicians are very forgetful of the responsibilities entrusted to them by their government. This coordination provision was originally proposed to the Soviet and British governments by the US President, agreed upon by the three leaders at Yalta, and formulated by the US government on December 5, 1944. The document on voting procedures in the Security Council submitted by the US delegation at Yalta stated that there were two factors that the US government considered important on this issue: "The first is that, in order to maintain world peace and security, the unity of the permanent members is very important."

The US government is violating the basic principle of international law, the principle that treaties must be observed. This violation of the principle has even been declared as part of the action program of American foreign policy. John Foster Dulles, the US representative to the Second General Assembly, declared that the United States would "no longer return to the system of Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam."

The representatives of the Soviet Union in the Security Council are exercising their power to prevent resolutions against international cooperation, which is entirely in accordance with the goals and principles of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with the interests of the people and peace. On the other hand, the US and British representatives are using the veto to thwart the passage of resolutions that, as stipulated in the Charter, are aimed at promoting international security. For example, we can mention the fact that the US-UK bloc has used the veto to strike down Soviet proposals to eliminate the threats to peace caused by the situations in Spain, Syria, Lebanon, Indonesia, Palestine, Greece, and Egypt.

The Soviet Union has consistently strived to abide by the principles of equality of national sovereignty and coordination among the great powers in order to strengthen the power of the United Nations, without which the United Nations organization cannot be effective.

A few days ago, the United States carried out another conspiracy in violation of the principles of the United Nations, taking advantage of the opportunity to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. The Charter stipulates that the term of office of the non-permanent members of the Security Council is two years, and the General Assembly elects three non-permanent members each year. Hitherto, in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Charter and established practice, the General Assembly follows two principles: seats are distributed according to geographical equality, and the nomination of new representatives must be agreed upon by the countries in the relevant geographical region.

The Eastern European countries proposed that Czechoslovakia replace Ukraine, which is withdrawing from the Security Council this year. Due to backroom agreements between the Tito group and representatives of other countries, the US delegation forced through the election of Yugoslavia, which is hostile to other Eastern European countries and is completely dependent on US policy. Of course, it cannot represent and cannot possibly represent the interests of the countries in this geographical region.

It is obvious that the Tito personnel appearing in the Security Council only represent himself and his masters in the State Department, and are only attempting to provoke and will not contribute to the successful work of the Security Council.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky pointed out at a press conference on October 18:

"Elections of non-permanent members by such a rude method of destroying the Charter and established practices can neither be recognized as legal nor can they be recognized as just... The Soviet Union has never compromised with those who destroy the Charter, especially those who destroy the foundations of the United Nations, and will never compromise."

Under these circumstances, it is clear that Yugoslavia cannot and will not be considered as the representative of the Eastern European countries in the Security Council. Electing Yugoslavia is tantamount to another more serious destruction of the United Nations Charter and undermines the foundations of international cooperation.

Another important principle of the Charter that arises from the principle of sovereign equality is that interference in the internal affairs of other countries is not permitted. Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter states:

"Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter."

This principle is of course also a thorn in the side of the US-UK warmongers. They want to use the United Nations as a means of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and turn it into a tool for expansionist goals. For this purpose, the US-UK bloc and its lackeys in the General Assembly have established special organizations, the existence of which is an unlawful violation of the Charter. These are the Balkan Committee, created to interfere in the internal affairs of Albania and Bulgaria, and the Korean Committee, formed to prevent the Korean people from unifying the country and to justify the illegal stationing of US troops in South Korea. In the current Fourth General Assembly, the US-UK bloc is using the International Court of Justice for the purpose of interfering in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. These countries are falsely accused of "violating the provisions of the treaties relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms." The absurdity of this accusation has been fully pointed out by Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky.

In fact, all the policies of the US-UK bloc are entirely aimed at turning the United Nations into an auxiliary body for warmongers and directly violate the Charter, which calls on member states to strictly abide by the obligations stipulated in the Charter.

Of particular importance in the struggle against warmongers is the Charter's provision for "settling international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace, security, and justice are not endangered."

The Charter also does not permit "the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or nation, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."

The Soviet delegation, in accordance with the instructions of the Soviet government, fully complied with this principle of the Charter and proposed at the Fourth General Assembly (September 23) to condemn the preparation of new wars, prohibit atomic weapons, and recommend that the five major powers conclude a treaty to consolidate peace.

Serious considerations prompted the submission of these proposals. Regardless of the 1947 General Assembly resolution condemning the propaganda of war preparations, this propaganda is still being carried out in many capitalist countries to this day, most notably in the United States and Britain.

We can cite many examples of this propaganda. An article on a plan for an anti-Soviet war of aggression was published in the August issue of "US News & World Report." This article was based on statements by officials such as General Bradley, General Vandenberg, Symington, and Louis Johnson. These warmongers fully revealed their bloodthirsty fantasies when speaking before committees of Congress. They neglected nothing, whether it was the Soviet Union "suddenly" dropping atomic bombs, or the European armies commanded by the United States attacking the Soviet Union, or the US army invading Europe. General Bradley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and member of the Standing Group of the Military Committee of the North Atlantic Alliance, explained in a speech at the American Forestry Association on October 12 that even if international co-management of atomic energy is realized, it cannot stop the United States from vigorously preparing for another war.

The frantic accumulation of armaments by the United States and Britain, the surge in military budgets (which is an intolerable burden for the working people), and a stubborn refusal to agree to prohibit atomic weapons—all of these, fundamentally speaking, are a direct destruction of the most basic provisions of the United Nations Charter. And, finally, those aggressive military blocs such as the Atlantic Alliance, the Western European Union, the Pan-American Union, the Council of Europe, and similar blocs organized by the United States and Britain, are directly and openly violating the Charter. These aggressive blocs are not only destroying the Charter, but also doing everything possible to undermine and try to abolish the United Nations.

The foreign policy decision-makers of the US-UK bloc do not conceal the fact that they do not like the United Nations because the United Nations is an annoying obstacle to launching new wars. In a speech at the plenary meeting of the General Assembly on September 26, Bevin said:

"I said very clearly in last year's General Assembly that we were disappointed with the progress of the United Nations... I have to point out that the obvious contradictions existing between the great powers cannot produce a satisfactory basis for a world peace mechanism."

Peace-loving countries believe that this satisfactory basis exists. It is the United Nations Charter. However, the effectiveness of the United Nations has been undermined by the conspiracies of those politicians. For their imperialist goals and aggressive plans, the United Nations Charter is an obstacle.

The Soviet Union's proposals at this General Assembly will greatly contribute to consolidating the United Nations and enhancing its power, prestige, and effectiveness. The constant attempts by US and British politicians to divert the direction of the United Nations, which has the direct responsibility of defending peace and international security, and the continuous and serious violations of the principles of the Charter, are a challenge to the masses of people in all countries, who are eager for peace and insist on defending peace. The Soviet Union, in its struggle for peace, has received the support of the masses of people in all countries, including capitalist countries.

The continuation of the aggressive policies of the American and British leaders, as Comrade Stalin has wisely pointed out, can only "end in the disgraceful failure of instigating a new war."

The principles of the United Nations Charter provide a basis for the beneficial cooperation of peace-loving countries. The struggle for these principles is inseparable from the struggle of the democratic camp against the instigators of new wars and for lasting peace and international security.

　　美英集团违反了联合国原则
    叶夫琴也夫著  陈有为译
    联合国宪章之实施，是在四年以前，一九四五年的十月二十四日。
    提出建立一个维护和平安全的新国际组织的意见的是苏联。早在一九四四年时，斯大林同志就曾指出需要“建立一个包括和平国家代表的特别组织，以便保卫和平维护安全。”联合国宪章之组成，苏联尽了他积极的责任，它是奠基于促进在今日现状下各国和平民主合作的原则之上的。
    实施联合国宪章的这四个年头确实地证明了：联合国之成功是直接有赖于列强的外交政策的，它们被宪章确定了负维护和平的主要责任。战后国际政治上所形成的两条不同的路线，决定了对联合国两种不同的态度。
    一条路线表现了美国独占资本家们于急切地发动新战争与侵略的政策之下，强制建立他们的世界最高统治权，宪章的条文已成为美英集团热中侵略的阻碍，他们废弃了合作的政策，而进行把国际组织转为进行它们冒险计划的工具。美英集团这种违反宪章原则的活动是在联合国内部和联合国范围以外进行着的——组成了违反联合国之目的与宪章的各种形式的经济上、军事上与政治上的联盟。
    另一条路线是各国友好、合作与和平的路线——这就是以苏联为首的民主反帝阵营中的国家所遵行的政策。这些国家无可非议地遵守了联合国宪章和他们其他的国际义务。他们不疲倦地为维护与达成宪章上的民主目标与原则而奋斗，并保障联合国的威信，以免为真诚国际合作的敌人之行为所破坏。
    ×　×　×　×
    联合国机构与活动的基本原则之一就是所有会员国主权之平等。斯大林同志曾说过：
    “假若联合国组织将来在维持平等的原则上是成功的话，那么，它在保障世界的和平与安全的上面，无疑地将要担任一个重大的积极的任务。”
    宪章中所确定的联合国基本目的之一是：
    “发展国际间以尊重人民平等权利及自决原则为根据之友好关系，并采取其他适当办法以增强普遍和平。”（第一条第二款）
    第二条也指明了“本组织系基于各会员国主权平等之原则”的。很显然地，宪章中所宣称的各国主权平等之原则，是不可能与美英集团为了建立华尔街的世界统治而奴役其他国家的政策相协调的。美国和英国的统治集团正侵犯并毁坏着这个原则。
    否认若干国家的主权与独立是他们这样做的主要手段。在美、英外交政策中，这个路线表现在杜鲁门宣言中，在马歇尔计划中，在一连串的勒索性的不平等条约中，和在签订侵略性的北大西洋公约中，当然，参与这个公约的国家，除了美国，实际上都被剥夺了它们的主权。而美国专横地要求什么“机会均等”、“贸易自由”、“航海自由”、“内河自由”等等亦是为了达到同一目的的。这种要求的结果是资本主义国家中最强有力的美国，企图在经济上、技术上、军事上去压服较弱的和经战争削弱的资本主义国家以向美国听命，变它们为美国的附庸国家并跟从美国务院的政策。在联合国的实际活动中，这种附庸行为表现于某些国家代表的服从美国命令。这也就是臭名昭著的“投票机器”的来源。
    在另一方面，所有大小国家一律平等却是苏联外交政策的基本原则之一。这是合理地根据民族自决的原则的，苏维埃国家的民族政策，也是根据这种民族自决的原则。
    苏联在联合国中有力地支持了国家主权平等的原则，因为，如斯大林同志所曾经指出的，“国际组织的力量，存在于这样一件事实，就是它是建立在各国平等的原则上面，而不是建立在某些国家支配其他国家的原则的上面。”
    国家主权的平等，与宪章上另一基本概念——即大国一致的概念是密切联系着的。对于除了程序问题以外之一切问题，安全理事会——即宪章上所谓负“维持国际和平及安全之主要责任”者——的决议，只有获得七理事国包括全体常任理事国之同意票后，才能生效（宪章第二十七条第三款）。同样的，由于大国的重要与权限，它们承担了保卫和平的主要责任，它们有权不准通过它们认为与保卫和平观点不符的决议。大国间基于平等原则的合作，是维护国际和平不缺少的条件。
    当战争还在进行的时候，斯大林同志对于国际组织，曾经说过：
    “我们是否可以估计这个国际组织的活动会十分有效的呢？假使在反希特勒德国战争中担负主力的列强，在战后继续其一致协调的精神，它们是会生效的。如果这个主要条件被违反了，那么它们就不会有效。”
    自从联合国成立以后，安全理事会各常任理事国一致协调的原则被美英集团代表们作为恶毒攻击的目标。他们称这为“不可容忍的否决权”，“不公正的否决权”等等。早在联合国的第一届大会时，美国的附庸们即提出一项决议修改宪章上一致协调的原则。这个对于组织基础的直接攻击，为苏联代表团在另一些代表团支持下所击退。在联大第二届会议时，一种侧击的战略在进行着。这时候，美国代表团已不是偷偷摸摸而是公开地活动了。它提出了一项决议，主张在“附属机构”的伪装名义下，组织一个所谓为了在各届大会期间研究、调查、讨论各项问题的“临时委员会”。并且提议这个委员会的职权可以扩展到国际和平安全问题。不用说，大国协调的原则是不会在这个委员会中实行的。这是想用临时委员会来代替安全理事会，以便在决议事项的时候有更多傀儡的帮助。美国代表团运用它的投票机器要强制通过这一决议，虽然，这决议是作了若干修改。但是，结果证明了，临时委员会是一个难产的东西，因为苏联和另一些国家，都拒绝参加那些明显抵触联合国宪章的组织。但不管这些，今年十月十九日，在美国代表团的压力之下，大会特别政治委员会的多数代表们决定向联大建议无限期地延长临时委员会的存在。
    虽然所有破坏安全理事会的企图都失败了，但对于一致协调原则的攻击还继续到今天。提议“否决权自由化”，“取消否决权”和类似的事情正在很迅速地接二连三地进行着。
    美国政治家们对于他们政府所付托的责任是非常健忘的。这种协调的规定原是由美国总统向苏英政府提议，于雅尔达经三国领袖赞同，而在一九四四年十二月五日由美国政府制订的。美国代表团在雅尔达提出的关于安理会中投票程序的文件，声称在这问题上有两个因素美国政府认为很重要：“第一个就是，为了维护世界和平与安全，常任理事国间的一致是很重要的。”
    美国政府正在侵犯着国际法的基本原则，即条约必须遵守的原则。对于这个原则的违反，甚至曾被宣称是美国外交政策行动纲领的一部分。约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯，第二届联大的美国代表，曾宣称美国将“不会再退回到德黑兰、雅尔达与波茨坦的体系去”。
    苏联在安理会中的代表们正在行使他们的权力以阻止反对国际合作的决议，这完全是符合于联合国宪章的目标与原则，并符合于人民与和平的利益。在另一方面，美英的代表们则应用否决权来挫折那些一如宪章所规定的旨在促进国际安全的决议的通过。举例来说，我们可以提一提一件事实，即美英集团曾运用否决权来打击苏联建议消除西班牙、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、印尼、巴勒斯坦、希借与埃及等地局势所引起的对和平的威胁。
    苏联一贯努力遵守国家主权平等与列强协调的原则，以加强联合国的权力，没有这些，联合国组织是不可能生效的。
    ×　×　×　×
    几天前美国又进行了一项违反联合国原则的阴谋，它利用了选举安理会非常任理事国的机会。宪章规定安理会的非常任理事国任期二年，每年联大选举三个非常任理事国。迄今为止，遵照宪章第二十三条的规定与既定惯例，联大遵循两个原则：根据地域平等分配席位，新代表之提名须得各个有关地域国家之同意。
    东欧国家提议由捷克来代替今年退出安理会的乌克兰。由于铁托集团与另一些国家的代表在幕后的协定，美国代表团强迫通过了选举对其他东欧国家具有敌意的完全依附于美国政策的南斯拉夫，当然，它是不可以代表，也不可能代表这个地理区域内各国的利益的。
    这是很明显的，铁托人员出现在安理会中，只代表了他自己与他们在国务院中的主子，只是企图挑衅而不会对安理会有成就的工作有所贡献的。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十月十八日的记者招待会上指出：
    “用这种粗野的破坏宪章和既定惯例的方法来选举非常任理事是既不可能承认其为合法，也不可能承认其为公正的……苏联与那些破坏宪章的行为，特别是与毁坏联合国基础的那些人们，从来没有妥协过，而且也永不会妥协。”
    在这种状况之下，很显然地，南斯拉夫是不可能也不会被认为是在安理会中东欧国家的代表的。选举南斯拉夫等于是另一次更严重的毁坏了联合国的宪章，并破坏了国际合作的基础。
    ×　×　×
    根据主权平等原则而产生了宪章的另一个重要原则，就是不准许干涉其他国家的内政。宪章第二条第七款指出：
    “本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件，依本宪章提请解决。”
    这种原则对于美英战争贩子当然也是一个眼中钉。它们想以联合国作为干涉别国内政的手段，并变它为扩张主义目标的工具。为了这个目的，美英集团和它在联大的喽罗们的帮助，成立了一些特别的组织，这些组织的存在对于宪章是不法的侵犯。这些就是巴尔干委员会，制造来为了干涉阿尔巴尼亚与保加利亚的内政，与朝鲜委员会，组成来阻止朝鲜人民统一国家并为美军非法驻留南朝鲜辩护。在目前第四届联大中，美英集团为了干涉保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚内政的目的而利用国际法庭。这些国家被诬控为“违反和约中有关人权与基本自由的规定”。这种控告的荒谬已完全为苏联代表团长维辛斯基所指出。
    事实上美英集团所有的政策完全是为了变联合国为战贩们的辅助机构，并直接违反宪章，而宪章却是号召会员国严格遵守宪章规定的义务的。
    与战贩斗争中特别重要的是宪章上规定“以和平方法解决国际争端，俾免危及国际和平、安全及正义”的规定。
    宪章并且不准许“使用威胁或武力或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家领土完整或政治独立”。
    苏联代表团依照苏联政府的指示，完全遵守宪章的这种原则，在四届联大中（九月二十三日）提出谴责准备新战争，禁用原子武器并建议五强缔结巩固和平公约等。
    严重的考虑促使提出这些提议。不顾一九四七年联大谴责宣传战争准备的决议，这些宣传一直到现在还在许多资本主义国家中进行着，尤其显著的是在美国与英国。
    我们可以引证许多这种宣传的例子。在“美国新闻与世界报导”的八月号上发表了一篇论反苏侵略战争计划的文章，这篇文章根据勃莱德雷将军，范登堡将军，薛明顿和路易斯·约翰生等官员的声明而作。这些战贩们在国会的委员会上发言的时候，充分地透露出他们渴血的幻想。他们什么亦没有忽略，什么在苏联“突如其来”地扔原子弹，或者是由美国指挥的欧洲军队进攻苏联，或者是由美国军队来侵略欧洲。美国联合总参谋长与北大西洋联盟军事委员会常设小组会员的勃莱德雷将军，在十月十二日美国森林协会上演讲时，说明了即使国际共管原子能实现了，也不能阻止美国气势正盛地准备另一次战争。
    美国与英国疯狂的堆集军火，军事预算的激增（这对于劳动人民是不能容忍的负担）。和对协议禁用原子武器的一种顽固的拒绝——所有这些，根本地讲来，是对于联合国宪章最基本条文的直接毁坏，并且，最后，那些大西洋联盟，西欧联盟，泛美联盟，欧洲会议与相似的为美国与英国组织起来的侵略性的军事集团，都是直接地公开地违犯了宪章。这些侵略集团，不单是毁坏了宪章，并且是千方百计地在破坏并想取消联合国。
    美英集团的外交政策决策者，并不隐瞒联合国不受他们喜欢的事实，因为联合国是发动新战争的讨厌障碍。在九月二十六日联大全体会议上，贝文演讲时曾说：
    “我在去年联大中曾很清楚地说过，我们对于联合国的进展是感到失望的……我不得不指出，存在于大国之间的明显的矛盾，是不可能产生世界和平机构的满意基础的。”
    爱好和平的国家相信，这种满意的基础是存在的。它就是联合国宪章。但是，联合国的效能已被那些政客们的阴谋所破坏了。对于他们的帝国主义目标与侵略计划，联合国宪章是一个障碍。
    苏联在本届联大的提议，将大大地有利于巩固联合国并增强它的权能、威信与效用。美英政治家们经常地企图转移负有直接保卫和平与国际安全责任的联合国的方向、和不断地对宪章原则的严重的侵犯，都是向所有国家人民大众的挑战，他们是渴爱和平并坚持保卫和平的。苏联在争取和平的斗争中，得到了包括资本主义国家在内的一切国家人民大众的支持。
    美国与英国领袖们侵略政策的继续，将如斯大林同志英明地指出一样，只能“因煽动新战争的可耻失败而告终。”
    联合国宪章的原则辅设了爱好和平国家有利合作的基础。争取这些原则的斗争是与民主阵营反对新战争的煽动者、争取持久和平国际安全的斗争分不开的。
