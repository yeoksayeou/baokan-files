　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong on the 15th: a Kuomintang gang spokesperson who had spoken with the White bandit Chongxi, after coming to Hong Kong from Hainan Island, said: The White bandit Chongxi had recently met with the French imperialist lackey, Vietnamese Nationalist Party member Wu Hongqing, in Longzhou, southwestern Guangxi, and signed a secret agreement. According to this secret agreement, the French side allowed the remnants of the White bandits to enter Vietnam from near Longzhou, disguised as "Vietnamese Volunteer Army," to assist the French side in fighting the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army. Currently, the remnants of two armies of the White bandit army have entered Vietnam and will be reorganized into the so-called "Vietnamese Volunteer Army" in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam. Furthermore, according to a United Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 16th: a conversation with a Guangxi person confirmed that 20,000 troops of the White bandit Chongxi's forces had crossed the Vietnamese border and joined the army of the French puppet Bao Dai as "volunteers." The White bandit Chongxi's headquarters in Haikou did not deny that the Kuomintang bandit army had joined the Vietnamese French colonial army. Moreover, according to Agence France-Presse, Saigon, on the 15th, quoting French official sources: it is believed that the Kuomintang bandit army marched into Vietnam in dense formations along with their officers. This French source's news is tantamount to admitting that the entry of the White bandit army into Vietnam was with the prior consent of the French side.

　　匪帮与法方供认：
    白匪残部逃入越境事前得到法方同意
    【新华社北京十八日电】据路透社香港十五日电；一个曾与白匪崇禧谈话的国民党匪帮发言人由海南岛来香港后说：白匪崇禧不久以前曾在广西西南部的龙州与法帝国主义走狗越南国民党分子武鸿卿会谈，并签订了一项密约，根据该密约，法方允许白匪残部由龙州附近进入越南，伪装为“越南志愿军”，协助法方与越南人民解放军作战。现白匪军已有两个军的残部入越，将在越南法军占领区整编为所谓“越南志愿军”。又据合众社香港十六日电：一个广西人的谈话，证实白崇禧匪部两万军队越过越南边界，加入法国傀儡保大的军队，作为“志愿军”。白匪崇禧在海口的总部并不否认国民党匪军加入越南法国殖民军。又据法国官方的法新社西贡十五日电：人们相信国民党匪军曾是以密集队形随同他们的军官开入越南。该法方消息无异供认白匪军的进入越南事先系得到法方同意。
