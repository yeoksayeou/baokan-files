　　Guangzhou People's Bank Business Development
  　RMB Credit Consolidated
  　Prices Generally Fall by 30-40%
    [Our report] Since the opening of the Guangzhou Branch of the People's Bank of China on November 2, its business has developed rapidly. By mid-November, the RMB was already widely circulating in the market and was readily accepted by everyone. Over the past month, Guangzhou citizens have enthusiastically brought Hong Kong dollars, silver dollars, and US dollars to the bank to exchange for RMB, and the RMB's prestige has been further consolidated. After emergency measures were taken against speculative money dealers on the 5th of this month, prices generally fell by 30 to 40 percent, and the RMB also rose from 3,000-4,000 yuan per Hong Kong dollar to the official exchange rate of 1,500 yuan per dollar. The prices of medium-quality white rice and fine cloth have also fallen sharply. The bank's current main business is to handle exchanges, collection of payments on behalf of others, and the establishment of remittance relationships with various places, so as to organize remittances in the short term.

    【本报讯】中国人民银行广州分行自十一月二日开业以来，业务迅速发展。人民币于中旬即已在市场上普遍流通，人人乐用。月来广州市民均踊跃持港币、银元、美钞到该行兑换人民币，人民币威信益见巩固。本月五日对投机银钱业采取紧急措施后，物价又普遍下落百分之三十至四十，人民币亦由三四千元换港币一元提高到按人民币牌价一千五百元换一元，中等白米及细布价格已均猛落。该行目前主要业务是办理兑换、代收款项、及与各地建立汇兑关系，以便在短期内举办汇兑。
